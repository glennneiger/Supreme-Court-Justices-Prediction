mr.
steven
r.
kartagener
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
this
court
is
well
aware,
perhaps
nothing
tears
more
at
the
fabric
of
federal-state
relations
in
the
criminal
law
area
that
federal
habeas
corpus
review
of
state
criminal
convictions,
and
it
is
a
case
such
as
the
present
one
that
helps
make
clear
why
that's
so.
more
that
15
years
ago,
on
july
4th,
1970,
respondent
wilson
and
two
unapprehended
accomplices
murdered
a
fellow
by
the
name
of
sam
reiner
during
the
course
of
a
robbery
of
a
taxi
garage
in
the
bronx.
the
accuracy,
the
reliability,
the
validity
of
that
state
jury
verdict
convicting
him
of
that
crime
has
never
really
been
open
to
question,
because
there's
no
question
that
we're
dealing
with
a
guilty
man.
innocence
is
not
part
of
this
case
before
the
court.
since
1972
when
the
case
did
proceed
to
the
state
court
trial,
the
defendant
has
been
litigating
a
sixth
amendment
claim
that
has
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
accuracy
or
integrity
of
the
truth-finding
process
at
his
state
court
trial.
the
issue
related
to
the
manner
in
which
manifestly
reliable
and
voluntary
admissions
were
obtained
from
him
from
a
jailhouse
informant,
one
benny
lee.
and
i
say
he's
been
litigating
it
since
1972,
and
litigate
it
he
certainly
has
been
doing.
he
had
the
opportunity
to
litigate
this
issue
in
the
state
court
at
a
pretrial
hearing.
he
litigated
it
at
trial
in
1972.
he
litigated
his
sixth
amendment
issue
without
success
in
the
state
appellate
courts.
when
that
was
unavailing,
he
moved
into
the
federal
courts,
pursuing
federal
habeas
corpus
review.
he
had
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
litigate
the
issue
before
a
district
court,
which
found
that
the
statements
were
not
obtained
improperly.
proceeding
on
to
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals,
they
too
found
that
there
was
no
impropriety
in
the
manner
in
which
the
statements
were
obtained.
then
this
court
decided
united
states
v.
henry
in
1980
and
the
petitioner,
or
i
should
say
the
respondent
before
this
court,
wilson,
started
all
over
again.
he
went
back
into
federal
court,
commencing
a
new
habeas
corpus
action,
claiming
then,
which
is
contrary
to
the
argument
he
makes
now,
that
henry
established
a
new
rule
of
law
entitled
to
retroactive
application
in
habeas
corpus.
he
lost
in
the
district
court
because
the
district
court
found,
as
we
argued,
that
henry
really
didn't
change
the
law.
it
found
that
he'd
really
had
an
ample
bite
at
the
apple
the
first
time
around,
and
it
also
gave
appropriate
recognition
and
paid
due
deference
to
some
very
important
factual
findings
that
emanated
from
not
only
the
state
court,
but
from
the
federal
courts
during
the
first
habeas
corpus
application,
and
that
important
factual
finding
is
that
the
statements,
the
incriminating
statements
that
he
made
to
the
jailhouse
informant,
were
spontaneous,
were
completely
unsolicited.
he
did
then,
in
about
1982
or
1984,
move
on
to
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals,
a
second
panel
of
that
court,
which
for
the
first
time
found
a
constitutional
error,
where
no
other
court
found
it
to
exist,
and
i
point
out,
it
was
not
a
unanimous
court,
it
was
a
split
panel
of
that
court
that
said:
yes,
the
sixth
amendment
was
violated.
and
so
in
1974
the
people
of
new
york
state
were
told,
you're
back
to
square
one.
mr.
steven
r.
kartagener
excuse
me.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
1984,
14
years
after
the
murder,
you're
back
to
square
one.
all
that
went
before
you
is
of
no
moment,
because
we
are
also
going
to
disregard
the
factual
findings
of
spontaneity
that
were
made
by
all
the
courts
that
went
before
us.
all
that
went
before
is
of
no
moment.
you
retry
this
man,
14
years
after
the
crime,
or
let
him
free.
and
i
suggest
that
when
one
looks
at
the
history
of
this
case
and
the
manner
in
which
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
was
used
here,
one
can
understand
why
there
is
this
terrible
friction
that
results
between
federal
and
state
relations
because
of
habeas
corpus
review.
and
this
court
has
seen
instances
in
which
it's
been
argued
that
a
petitioner
has
abused
the
writ,
and
that's
a
term
of
art,
abuse
of
the
wait.
and
in
fact
we're
really
not
dealing
with
an
abuse
of
the
writ
case
as
that
term
of
art
is
generally
used
in
the
law,
but
there
is
an
abuse
of
the
writ
here,
not
by
the
petitioner
so
much
as
by
the
court
of
appeals,
the
manner
in
which
it
employed
the
writ
to
grant
relief
so
long
after
the
fact,
on
the
same
ground
that
had
previously
determined
on
the
merits
and
rejected
by
all
the
courts
that
went
before
it.
i
would
like
at
this
point
to
make
very
clear
that
i
do
not
wish
to
come
before
this
court
and
suggest
that
the
federal
writ
of
habeas
corpus
is
unimportant.
we
recognize
that
it
is
a
very
important
protection
and
clearly,
other
than
in
fourth
amendment
litigation,
where
a
state
prisoner
does
generally
not
have
the
right
to
come
into
federal
court
of
a
federal
habeas
corpus
application,
in
the
other
areas
of
constitutional
law
we
do
not
dispute
that
where
a
constitutional
issue
affects,
may
affect
the
validity
of
a
state
criminal
conviction,
a
state
prisoner
should
have
one
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
come
into
federal
court
and
have
the
federal
court
examine
that
constitutional
issue
before
a
conclusive
presumption
of
finality
attaches
to
that
state
court
criminal
conviction.
what
we
are
asking
the
court
to
reject
in
this
case
is
the
suggestion
by
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
that
the
habeas
corpus
really
is
is
a
never
ending
merry
go
round
ride,
available
to
state
habeas...
excuse
me,
state
prisoners,
who
will
have
the
opportunity,
based
on
the
most
recent
advance
sheet
or
the
most
recent
slip
opinion
that
adds
a
nuance
on
wrinkle
or
further
dimension
to
an
issue
of
constitutional
law
that
they
previously
litigated
and
lost
on,
to
come
right
back
into
the
federal
courts,
start
that
merry
go
round
ride
all
over
again,
with
the
hope
that
they'll
get
lucky
this
time
around.
we
think
that
the
rule
followed
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
allows
for
that
conclusion,
and
we
do
believe
that
that
rule,
seemingly
founded
on
this
court's
22
year
old
decision
in
united
states
v.
sanders,
is
an
erroneous
one
if
it's
applied
today.
and
i
say
that
because
if
you
look
at
the
court
of
appeals,
the
1984
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
they
view
their
obligation
in
this
case
to
be
one
in
which
they
would
have
to
give,
have
to
give,
some
consideration
to
the
repetitive,
successive,
identical
claim
under
the
sanders
analysis,
unless
it
could
be
shown
that
there
had
been
a
previous
merits
determination
and
the
ends
of
justice
would
not
be
served
by
reaching
the
merits
of
the
subsequent
application.
that's
the
old
sanders
test.
and
what
has
gone
largely
unnoticed,
it
seems,
in
the
law
for
many
years
is
that
is
1955
the
sanders
analysis
was
made
wholly
inapplicable
to
state
prisoners.
sanders
is
largely
a
case
of
statutory
construction
as
applied
to
repetitive,
successive
claim
situations.
i'm
not
talking
about
abuse
of
the
writ
situations,
where
the
defendant
comes
to
court
with
a
new
claim
which
he
has
previously
withheld.
and
sanders
addresses
both
aspects
of
habeas
corpus.
but
insofar
as
it
addresses
repetitive,
successive
claim
situations,
which
was
governed
at
the
time
in
1963
by
28
u.s.
code
2244,
which
was
then
applicable
to
both
state
and
federal
prisoners,
and
did
have
this
ends
of
justice
language
and
a
strong
presumption
of
consideration
of
a
successive
claim,
in
1966
congress
changed
the
law.
it
said,
as
to
state
prisoners,
you're
out
of
2244,
which
is
now
2244-called
ends
of
justice
before
you
ca
and
(c),
and
the
pertinent
provision
for
this
court's
consideration
with
respect
to
this
case
is
2244(b),
which
now
tells
the
federal
judiciary:
you're
no
longer
hampered
by
that
hurdle
of
giving
consideration
to
the
so-called
ends
of
justice
before
you
can
give
controlling,
conclusive
weight
to
a
previous
determination.
the
law
under
2244(b)
is
that
you
need
not
consider
a
subsequent,
successive,
repetitive
petition
unless
it
raises
a
new
ground,
and
only
if
it
is
found
that
the
petitioner
has
not
improperly
withheld
that
ground
the
first
time
around
or
somehow
abused
the
writ.
mr.
steven
r.
kartagener
well,
justice
rehnquist,
what
it
says
is
the
court
need
not
entertain
the
successive
petition
unless.
and
i
would
agree
with
you
that
it
does
not
contain
the
type
of
mandatory
language
that
we
would
prefer
to
see,
you
shall
not,
you
can
not.
but
we
suggest
that
the
whole
purpose
of
that
statute,
when
read
in
accord
with
the
congressional
intent,
which
is
shown
in
the
senate
report
that
accompanies
it,
was
to
have
that
statute
interpreted
as
one
in
which
there
would
ordinarily
be,
rather
than
a
presumption
of
let's
consider
the
repeated
claim,
the
presumption
should
be
you
don't
consider
the
repeated
claim.
mr.
steven
r.
kartagener
i
would
certainly
agree
with
that
position,
your
honor,
and
in
our
brief
we
argue
as
a
final
subsection
that,
even
if
the
ends
of
justice
analysis
were
to
be
considered
extant,
notwithstanding
the
congressional
mandatory
legislation
of
1966,
we
should
still
prevail
under
that
analysis.
why?
because
in
1966,
aside
from
all
of
the
important
concerns
that
the
court
has
so
recently
articulated
in
the
area
of
habeas
corpus...
the
need
for
finality,
the
need
for
a
conclusion
in
state
criminal
litigation,
the
important
need
to
have
the
state
criminal
trial
be
the
main
bout
and
not
just
the
preliminary
bout
in
a
long
line
of
knock-down,
drag-out
fights
in
the
federal
courts
on
constitutional
issues...
there
is
a
very
important
other
reason
why
that
end
of
justice
argument
would
support
us.
and
that
is
because
there
was
a
strong
suggestion
in
the
amendatory
legislation
of
1966
that...
and
this
is
in
the
senate
report,
which
we
cite
at
length
in
our
brief...
that
the
purpose
of
the
amendment
in
1966
was
to
bring
a
greater
degree
of
finality
to
state
habeas
corpus
applications,
and
indeed
a
qualified
application
of
the
doctrine
of
res
judicata,
which
as
this
court
is
well
aware
until
that
time
was
essentially
missing,
almost
in
its
entirety,
from
habeas
corpus.
and
i
would
suggest
that
we're
not
really
asking
for
res
judicata
principles
to
be
applied
under
our
rule
in
this
case,
not
in
the
strictest
sense,
because
res
judicata,
if
strictly
applied,
would
say
that
if
you
have
brought
one
habeas
corpus
application
and
you
left
out
a
claim
and
you
come
back
into
court
later
with
a
new
claim,
under
pure
res
judicata
principles
that
claim
would
be
barred
as
well.
that's
really
not
what
we're
arguing
about
here.
what
we're
suggesting
to
the
court
and
what
we're
asking
the
court
to
do
in
exercising
its
supervisory
capacity
over
the
lower
federal
courts,
just
as
the
court
did
in
sanders
in
interpreting
section
2244
as
it
then
existed,
what
we're
asking
the
court
to
do
is,
consistent
with
the
amendment
of
2244
making
it
2244(b),
consistent
with
that
congressional
intent,
consistent
with
all
of
the
important
concerns
that
the
court
has
articulated
about
the
need
to
bring
finality
to
habeas
corpus
litigation,
we're
asking
for
a
rule
not
really
of
res
judicata
effect,
but
really
a
qualified
rule
of
issue
preclusion.
and
it's
a
rather
simple
rule,
we
suggest,
and
a
rather
fair
rule.
we
ask
the
court
to
interpret
the
general
procedure
to
be
that
once
a
state
prisoner
has
had
one
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
litigate
the
merits
of
a
constitutional
claim
in
the
state
courts,
and
once
he's
had
an
additional
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
litigate
the
merits
of
his
constitutional
claim
in
the
federal
courts,
then
generally
that
should
be
the
end
of
the
matter.
but
recognizing,
justice
rehnquist,
your
noting
that
the
language
of
2244(b)
is
less
than
absolutely
mandatory,
and
recognizing
that
you
may
need
some
limited
room
for
an
exercise
of
discretion,
consistent
with
the
need
for
finality,
we
suggest
that
there
are
two
areas
where
you
might
allow
a
repetition
of
a
claim
previously
heard
and
rejected
on
the
merits.
and
i
think
it's
a
very
important
two
exceptions,
a
very
important
qualification,
because
i
think
one
of
the
things
that
would
certainly
bother
the
court
in
a
habeas
corpus
situation
is
if
we're
dealing
with
a
claim
that
really
raised
some
shadow
of
a
doubt
as
to
the
innocence
of
the
state
prisoner,
or
some
claim
that
truly
goes
to
the
accuracy,
integrity,
or
validity
of
the
factfinding
process.
and
what
we
suggest
as
the
exceptions
is
the
appropriate
suggestions
are
two
in
which
you
have...
well,
excuse
me...
the
first
one
being
if
there
are
new-found
facts
alleged,
new
facts
that
would
be
outcome
determinative,
facts
that
nobody
was
aware
of
the
first
time,
facts
which
suggest...
perhaps
that
a
confession
that
was
previously
found
to
be
acceptable,
suddenly
we
find
out
newly
that
the
police
beat
it
out
of
him.
that
type--
mr.
steven
r.
kartagener
--absolutely,
your
honor.
we
quote
from
that
article
in
our
reply
brief,
i
believe
in
our
main
brief
as
well,
and
i
suggest
that
the
title
of
that
article
really
makes
a
very
important
point.
innocence
should
not
be
irrelevant,
as
judge
friendly
has
suggested
and
many
other
legal
scholars
have
suggested.
but
we
take
into
consideration
the
need
for
some
flexibility
by
saying,
where
there
are
new-found
facts,
number
one,
which
will
go
to
the
issue
possibly
of
guilt
or
innocence
or
the
validity
of
a
confession,
to
make
sure
that
it
wasn't
beaten
out
of
him
by
the
police,
or
if
you
have
a
new
rule
of
law
that
would
be
found
to
be
retroactively
applicable
on
habeas
corpus,
the
petitioner
should
get
the
benefit
as
well.
and
as
this
court
is
well
aware,
the
most
common
rule
to
be
given
retroactive
analysis
in
a
collateral
proceeding
would
be
one
that
goes
to
the
very
integrity
or
accuracy
of
the
factfinding
process.
mr.
steven
r.
kartagener
the
state
court
finding
was
that
the
statements
were
spontaneous
and
completely
unsolicited.
2254(d)
told
the
federal
courts
to
give
deference
to
that
finding,
and
until
the
second
circuit's
most
recent
opinion
the
lower
courts
did
that.
and
that
is
a
very
important
point
when
we
discuss
the
merits
as
to
why
this
case
really,
as
we've
argued
all
along,
has
nothing
to
do
with
henry
or
maine
v.
moulton.
i
draw
the
court's
attention
to
justice
powell's
concurring
decision
in
henry.
i
draw
attention
as
well
to
the
chief
justice's
concurrence,
and
of
course
the
chief
justice
was
the
author
of
henry,
his
concurrence
is
snead
v.
stringer,
which
justice
rehnquist
wrote,
which
was
a
dissent
from
the
denial
of
certiorari,
where
there
has
been,
i
suggest,
some
uniformity
of
agreement
that
spontaneous,
truly
spontaneous
statements,
fall
outside
of
the
pale
of
sixth
amendment
concern,
if
they
really
are
spontaneous.
and
we
suggest
in
this
case
that
one
of
the
critical
errors
of
the
lower,
of
the
court
of
appeals,
is
that
they
paid
no
deferences
to
those
factual
findings
of
spontaneity.
and
we
further
argue
that
the
record
really
does
support
that
factual
finding,
that
these
statements
were
spontaneous.
unlike
henry,
there
was
a
factfinding
hearing
in
this
case.
in
henry
there
was
not.
the
jailhouse
informant,
benny
lee,
testified,
and
he
was
absolutely
credited,
that
there
was
never
any
asking
of
questions.
he
made
it
very
clear
that
there
was
no
attempt
to
inveigle
or
solicit
information
from
this
respondent
wilson.
his
sole
job,
the
job
given
him
by
the
detective
that
he
spoke
with,
was
to
keep
his
ears
open,
not
to
obtain
incriminating
information
about
wilson,
but
really
to
try
to
identify
the
two
other
participants
in
the
robbery,
who
were
responsible
for
the
murder.
and
i
point
out
to
this
day
they
still
go
unapprehended.
the
importance
of
this
rule
that
we
argue
in
terms
of
issue
preclusion
blends
with
the
merits
of
this
case,
because
we
think
that
one
of
the
evils
that
you
see
where
there
is
going
to
be
constant,
repetitive
consideration
of
the
same
claim
time
and
time
again
is
that
there
will
end
up...
you
will
end
up
with
new
factual
findings,
new
factual
inferences
being
drawn
by
the
most
recent
courts
if
they
disagree
for
their
own
reasons
with
other
courts.
and
that
shouldn't
be
the
rule
of
law
in
a
sane
and
rational
system
of
justice.
historical
facts
shouldn't
change.
they
don't
change.
the
law
can
change,
but
historical
facts
don't.
and
the
second
circuit,
in
deciding
that
it
would
consider
this
matter
on
the
merits,
really
ignored
the
fact
that
they
should
not
have
been
ignoring
so
blithely
the
factual
findings
of
spontaneity
that
occurred
in
this
case.
what
we
are
asking
this
court
to
do
in
positing
this
rule
of
qualified
issue
preclusion
is
really
to
breathe
life
into
the
congressional
intent
when
it
enacted
2244(b),
and
we
also
ask
the
court
to
announce
a
rule
that
will
bring
habeas
corpus
litigation
involving
successive,
repetitive
claims
into
accord
with
the
general
concerns
that
this
court
has
in
bringing
a
greater
degree
of
finality
to
habeas
corpus
litigation,
which
can
be
traced
back
to
justice
powell's
opinion
in
schneckloth
v.
bustamonte,
before
that,
if
we
were
to
go
back
further,
perhaps
justice
harlan's
dissent
in
sanders,
but
echoed
in
wainwright
v.
sykes
and
engle
v.
isaac
and
barefoot
v.
estelle,
that
state
court
proceedings
are
important.
they
should
not
be
that
first
bout,
as
i
made
mention
of.
and
i
would
like
to
suggest
as
well
that
it
really
doesn't
matter
that
courts
will
not
regularly
and
routinely
grant
relief
under
the
type
of
circumstances
that
the
second
circuit
did
in
this
case
the
second
time
around.
and
i
would
concede
that
you
probably
do
not
have
a
lot
of
reported
decisions
where
either
district
courts
or
circuit
courts
of
appeal
on
a
successive,
repetitive
claim
have
granted
the
relief.
but
the
real
evil
is
not
in
the
case
in
which
it
happens
to
be
granted.
true,
you
have
that
miscarriage
of
justice
here
because
an
effective
retrial
of
this
fellow
has
been
rendered
virtually
impossible
due
to
the
passage
of
time.
but
the
real
sin
of
the
second
circuit's
rule
and
the
rule
that
respondent
would
have
you
accept
in
this
case,
that
there
can
be
a
repetitious
consideration
of
state
criminal
convictions,
the
evil
of
that
is
the
potential
that
a
court
can
take
the
case
in
the
so-called
ends
of
justice,
whatever
that
amorphous
term
might
mean.
and
it
is
that
possibility
which
holds
out
a
beacon
to
disgruntled
state
prisoners,
always
looking
at
those
advance
sheets,
trying
to
get
back
into
federal
court.
and
i
think
that
the
better
position
should
be
that,
once
you
have
assured
that
one
full
and
fair
bite
at
the
apple
in
state
court,
that
second
full
and
fair
bite
at
the
apple
in
federal
court,
that
the
defendant,
that
the
state
defendant,
should
not
have
the
right
really
in
effect
to
devour
the
entire
apple.
that
would
be
silly,
and
that's
what
they're
asking
to
have
the
right
to
do.
and
i
suggest
that
if
this
petitioner
had
lost
in
the
second
circuit...
excuse
me:
i
apologize.
this
habeas
petitioner,
who
is
now
the
respondent,
had
he
lost
in
the
second
circuit
on
his
henry
claim,
by
his
analysis
perhaps
he'd
be
able
to
bounce
into
court
once
again
on
a
claim
that,
well,
maybe
moulton
really
makes
clear
finally
that
he
is
right
and
everybody
else
has
been
wrong
all
along.
i
just
don't
think
that
that's
what
habeas
corpus
is
about,
that
every
time
a
new
decision
comes
down
the
race
should
start
all
over
again.
i
know
respondent
comes
before
this
court
suggesting,
well,
but
here
there
was
really
plain
error
in
view
of
henry,
and
i
think
we've
dealt
with
that
on
the
merits
and
shown
why
henry
has
not
been
violated
here.
but
they'll
come
and
say,
but
it
was
plain
error,
there's
really
a
differential
basis
here
as
to
why
this
court
should
have
been
allowed
to
consider
the
successive,
repetitive
claim.
i
don't
think
that
argument
holds
water.
most
good
lawyers
can
find
in
a
new
decision
some
basis
for
suggesting
that
an
older
decision
really
may
not
have
been
as
correct
as
the
court
that
rendered
it
at
a
given
point
in
time
thought
it
was.
put
the
finality
concepts
are
just
so
important
and
the
search
for
absolute
justice
or
absolute
correctness
in
judicial
decisions,
ultimate
truth
in
judicial
decisions,
it's
just
too
elusive
to
warrant
the
endless
perpetuation
of
habeas
corpus
litigation
on
the
possibility,
as
i
say,
that
eventually
you'll
strike
it
lucky
with
some
sympathetic
federal
court.
in
the
end,
we
do
think,
and
we've
chronicled
at
length
in
our
brief
the
statutory
and
congressional
intent
basis
for
our
argument,
we
think
we've
also
supported
out
contentions
for
limiting
the
older
sanders
rule
as
applied
to
repetitive,
successive
claims.
and
by
the
way,
i
point
out
that
we're
not
arguing
that
sanders
has
been
undercut
in
the
abuse
of
the
writ
area.
justice
o'connor
is
rose
v.
lundy
makes
note
that
sanders
is
applicable
in
dealing
with
abuse
of
the
writ,
because
at
the
time
it
came
down
there
was
no
statute
that
governed
and
the
subsequent
statutes
that
were
enacted,
the
rules
that
were
enacted,
really
abide
by
the
sanders
analysis
in
dealing
with
"abuse
of
the
writ"
situations.
but
we're
not
talking
about
that
here,
and
insofar
as
it
applies
to...
excuse
me.
insofar
as
we're
dealing
with
a
successive,
repetitive,
same
ground
type
claim,
we
think
that
we
have
shown
the
statutory
basis,
the
congressional
intent
basis,
the
purposes
of
this
court
in
dealing
with
habeas
corpus
litigation,
the
purpose
of
bringing
finality,
reasonable
finality,
to
habeas
corpus.
we
think
we
justify
the
rule
that
we
urge
upon
the
court.
therefore,
i
would
like
only
briefly
to
move
on
to
our
contention
that
this
was
really
much
ado
about
nothing
in
some
respects,
because,
contrary
to
the
arguments
made
by
respondent,
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
the
state
is
coming
into
court
and
saying,
don't
look
at
the
merits,
go
with
the
procedural
arguments
that
we're
talking
about,
because
if
you
do
look
at
the
merits
the
state
has
to
lose
under
henry.
that's
just
not
clear
and
it's
not
accurate.
what
you
had
here,
and
we
think
it's
just
so
critical,
are
very
important
factual
findings
of
spontaneity.
as
i've
already
indicated,
the
lower
court,
the
state
court,
found
it.
the
district
court
the
first
time
found
it.
the
second
circuit
certainly
the
first
time
gave
recognition
of
the
doctrine
that
spontaneous
statements
are
outside
of
the
sixth
amendment
concerns
of
massiah.
the
district
court
the
second
time
around
gave
also
appropriate
respect
to
those
findings
of
spontaneity,
and
it
was
just
the
second
circuit
that
chose
willy-nilly
to
disregard
them.
we
think
that
for
there
to
be
a
violation
of
henry
what
you
need
is
some
form
of...
excuse
me,
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
as
interpreted
by
henry
and
other
decisions
of
the
court...
you
have
to
have
some
form
of
deliberate
elicitation.
now,
what
that
is...
i'm
not
suggesting
that
is
interrogation,
which
is
an
argument
that's
been
put
to
the
court
before
in
brewer
or
in
perhaps
maine
v.
moulton.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
it
can
be...
excuse
me,
your
honors.
i
see
that
my
time--
mr.
steven
r.
kartagener
--excuse
me?
mr.
steven
r.
kartagener
yes,
but
i
was
hoping
to
reserve
my
remaining
five
minutes.
so
i
will
pick
up
in
reply
if
i
may
be
permitted
to,
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
steven
r.
kartagener
i
think
that
the
discretion
is
controlled
by
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard.
mr.
steven
r.
kartagener
your
honor,
i
think
if
the
case
comes
up
on
appeal,
for
example
to
a
court
of
appeals,
where
the
district
court
refused
to
consider
the
petition,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
would
then
have
to
decide
whether,
given
all
the
facts
and
circumstances,
the
ends
of
justice
would
have
been
served
by
the
district
court
considering
the
petition.
mr.
steven
r.
kartagener
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
i
might
take
my
five
minutes
remaining
and
discuss
a
few--
mr.
steven
r.
kartagener
--excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
steven
r.
kartagener
thank
you,
your
honor.
--discuss
a
few
of
the
points
that
i
finished
on,
also
some
that
were
raised
by
the
court
during
the
course
of
my
adversary's
argument.
we
read
henry
and
the
henry
line
of
cases
as
requiring
some
product
coming
from
the
defendant
whose
in
the
jailhouse--
mr.
steven
r.
kartagener
--there
has
to
be
a
stimulation
by
the
government
that
bears
fruit.
and
i
think
that's
rather
clear
when
you
look
at
the
henry
case,
in
which
nickles
testified
that
he
wasn't
just
a
passive
listener
in
the
room.
he
had...
and
this
is
quoting
from
nickles'
testimony
at
his
trial,
and
this
is
from
the
decision
in
henry...
he
had
"some
conversations
with
mr.
henry
while
he
was
in
jail.
"
and
henry's
incriminating
statements
were
"the
product
of
this
conversation".
to
the
contrary,
in
this
case
you
have
a
clear
factual
finding
that
the
statements
made
by
respondent
wilson
were
not
the
product
of
whatever
conversations
were
going
on
between
him
and
bennie
lee.
and
i
draw
attention,
of
course,
to
mr.
justice
powell's
concurrence
in
henry
and
also
a
footnote
in
maine
v.
moulton
which
certainly
suggests
that
you
have
to
have
something
that
really
is
tantamount
in
some
sense
to
interrogation,
and
if
it's
not
interrogation
it
still
has
to
be
deliberately
elicited.
it
has
to
come
to
the
government
because
the
government
because
the
government
inveigled
it
in
some
way
surreptitiously
from
the
speaker.
and
what
you
have
in
this
case
is
a
very
important
factual
finding.
the
factual
finding
is
that
the
stimulus
that
prompted
respondent
wilson
to
make
the
statement
came...
and
this
is
a
factual
finding
which
basically
everybody
below
prion
to
the
second
circuit
the
second
time
around
agreed
in,
that
the
stimulus
for
the
incriminating
statement
came
because...
same
from
a
very
disconcerting
visit
to
wilson
in
jail
from
his
brother.
it
was
a
visit
by
his
brother,
i
would
say,
in
which
he
communicated
to
wilson
that
the
family
was
very
upset
with
him
for
having
killed
rainer.
wilson's
brother
worked
at
the
taxicab
garage
himself.
they
were
very
upset,
and
after
this,
as
is
clear
from
the
record,
he
became
very
upset.
this
is
what
prompted
him
to
talk.
it
was
clear
that
he
was
looking
for
a
shoulder
to
cry
on.
benny
lee
offered
him
the
shoulder,
but
he
didn't
cause
the
tears.
the
tears
came
from
an
attenuated
independent
source
apart
from
the
government.
even
if
the
court
were
to
find
in
this
case
an
effort
at
deliberate
elicitation
under
henry,
it
still
wasn't
fruitful.
mr.
steven
r.
kartagener
they
did,
and
we
suggest
to
the
court,
as
we've
pointed
out
in
both
our
main
brief
and
our
reply
brief,
that
their
view
of
the
record
did
not
accord
with
the
factual
findings
made
by
courts
before
it,
and
that
there
are
historical
facts
here
of
spontaneity,
that
they
just--
mr.
steven
r.
kartagener
--forgot
about.
mr.
steven
r.
kartagener
no,
there
was
no
question
that
there
were
conversations.
mr.
steven
r.
kartagener
yes.
but
clearly
there
were
no
questions.
that's
a
clear
factual
finding.
mr.
steven
r.
kartagener
well,
if
that
were--
mr.
steven
r.
kartagener
--and
if
the
respondent...
or
if
the
defendant
or
his
partner
did
immediately
go
and
confess
to
him,
let's
say--
mr.
steven
r.
kartagener
--i
would
suggest
then
that
is
a
product
of
the
stimulus
offered
by
the
governmental
agent.
i
believe
i
agree
and
i
would--
mr.
steven
r.
kartagener
--i
suggest,
justice
white,
that
that's
a
straw
man
in
the
case.
that
occurred
the
first
day,
when
wilson
walked
into
the
cell.
if
i
might
amplify
upon
that
briefly,
justice
white.
well,
what
happened
is
wilson
walks
into
the
cell,
he
starts
running
off
at
the
mouth
about--
mr.
steven
r.
kartagener
--and
will
you
help
me
come
up
with
that
better
story;
i
would
say
then
you
have,
then
you
might
have
the
type
of
elicitation
that
would
be
in
violation
of
henry.
but
that's
not
what
you
have
here.
what
you
have
in
response
to
the
statement
when
he
walks
into
the
cell
and
he
says
he's
upset
about
what
happened,
they're
accusing
him
of
the
crime,
and
he
gives
this
false
story
to
lee
as
to
what
had
occurred,
lee
says:
that
sounds
lousy;
you
ought
to
come
up
with
a
better
story.
it's
clear
from
the
record,
the
respondent
didn't
change
his
story.
he
kept
his
mouth
shut.
he
didn't
say
a
thing.
what
prompted
him
to
start
speaking
about
the
crime
was
this
very
upsetting
visit
from
his
family.
i
think
it's
particularly
interesting
to
note
that
at
the
suppression
hearing
the
notes
that
were
taken
by
benny
lee
were
introduced
into
evidence,
and
it's
interesting
that
right
in
those
contemporaneous
notes
that
he
was
keeping
are
the
following
words:
"all
my
family
asked
me,
why
did
i
kill
sam,
he
was
such
a
nice
man.
"
"this
worries
him
a
lot.
"
"he
swears
to
kill
uncle
if
he's
ever
free,
because
uncle
is
telling
the
family
he
killed
the
boss.
"
mr.
steven
r.
kartagener
we
did
argue
that,
justice
stevens,
and
in
effect
the
court
essentially
disregarded
it,
went
to
the
merits
and
threw
it
out,
not
purely
on
the
merits
from
a
henry
standpoint,
but
finding
that
he
was
going
to
give
due
deference
to
the
spontaneity
finding
of
the
earlier
courts--
mr.
steven
r.
kartagener
--and
that
took
it
outside
of
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
steven
r.
kartagener
i
thank
the
court.
