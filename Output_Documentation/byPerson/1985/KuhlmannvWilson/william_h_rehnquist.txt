justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
1984?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it's
cast,
isn't
it,
mr.
kartagener,
in
terms
of
the
thing
may
he,
the
writ
may
be
dismissed,
not
that
the
writ
must
be
dismissed?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
even
if
sanders
by
virtue
of
the
rules
and
the
advisory
notes
still
governed,
i
would
think
that
you
could
use
the
term
"ends
of
justice"
for
your
purpose
as
much
as
your
opponent
could.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
something
along
the
lines
of
judge
friendly's
article,
"is
innocence
irrelevant"?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
weber,
has
your
client
in
the
second
federal
habeas
proceeding
made
anything
that
you
would
describe
as
a
colorable
claim
of
factual
innocence?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can
answer
that
yes
or
no,
can't
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
would
you
seriously
contend
before
a
neutral
body,
say
of
arbitrators
rather
than
lawyers,
that
there
isn't
enough
evidence
to
support
your
client's
conviction
for
the
crime?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
has
that
argument
been
made
before
in
these
federal
habeas
proceedings?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
said
has
it
been
made
before.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
it's
just
a
standardless
discretion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
would
you
decide
in
a
particular
case
whether
a
district
court
or
court
of
appeals
had
properly
either
considered
the
petition
or
refused
to
consider?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there's
nothing
more
general
than
that?
each
case
is
entirely
fact
specific?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
sanders
no
longer
governs
this
situation
by
its
terms.
sanders
was
a
federal
habeas
corpus
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
there
may
be
carryover
from
the
language
of
sanders,
but
i
don't
see
that
you
can
argue
that
particular
language
in
sanders
that
wasn't
carried
over
in
the
advisory
committee
notes
is
binding.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
would
have
to
have
been
dicta,
i
suppose.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
would
you
say
that
the
ends
of
justice
language
in
the
section
and
the
notes
always
indicate
an
argument
in
favor
of
extended
review,
or
would
you
say
that
the
ends
of
justice
might
on
occasion,
perhaps
in
the
fourth
or
fifth
petition
or
if
there
isn't
any
colorable
claim
of
innocence,
indicate
that
the
petition
shouldn't
be
reviewed?
