ready.
chief

warren
e.
burger
what
was
the
trial
court
finding
with
respect
to
who
prompted
the
conversations?
chief
justice
warren
e.

that's
just
your
warning
light.

very
well.
mr.
weber,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
the
finding
of
the
trial
court
that
these
were
spontaneous
statements?
you
say
they're
clearly
erroneous?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don't
purport
to
be
quoting
what
he
actually
said,
do
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you're
not
purporting
to
quote
what
he
said?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
said
you
are
to
listen,
you
are
not
to
initiate.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
court
found
that
that
added
up
to
a
spontaneous
declaration.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
was
to
find
out
by
keeping
his
ears
open,
wasn't
that
essentially
the
statement?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
that
there
had
been
a
recording
device
in
the
cell
and
there
was
just
some
other
prisoner,
just
a
casual
occupant
of
the
cell--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--and
this
gentleman
talked
and
said
all
the
things
he
said
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
counsel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
five
minutes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
five
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
