mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
--thank
you
for
reminding
me.
i
took
a
look
at
mr.
reynolds'
size
before
i
approached
the
lecturn,
and
i
thought
that
i
would
not
have
to
do
this,
but
apparently
he
forgot
to
raise
it.
the
plaintiff
and
the
defendants
have
different
perspectives
in
this
case,
and
therefore
we
have
agreed
to
divide
our
argument,
and
the
court
actually
granted
that
motion.
i
would
like
to
speak
to
two
points.
when
congress...
vanguards
here
assert
two
points
and
i
will
address
both.
when
congress
enacted
title
7,
it
gave
the
federal
courts
broad
authority
to
remedy
discrimination,
including
the
authority
to
use
race-conscious
remedies
in
appropriate
circumstances,
and
second,
this
court
should
treat
a
consent
decree,
which
includes
race-conscious
affirmative
action
as
voluntary
action
in
accordance
with
weber
not
as
court-imposed
relief,
and
it
does
not
make
a
difference
that
the
petitioner
did
not
consent.
now,
before
turning
to
the
merits
of
my
argument,
i
would
like
to
address
a
couple
of
factual
points
that
came
up
during
the
preceding
30
minutes.
first,
there
is
simply
no
dispute
on
the
record
that
for
years
the
city
of
cleveland
has
discriminated
against
minorities
and
that
a
remedy
was
appropriate.
there
is
no
argument
also
that
this
remedy
is
unreasonable.
in
response
to
justice
powell's
question
earlier,
there
is
clearly
nothing
in
this
decree
that
requires
the
promotion
of
unqualified
individuals.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
passing
a
promotional
examination
is
a
prerequisite
to
minority
and
non-minority
promotion
alike.
in
addition,
i
would
point
out
that
there
is
nothing
on
the
record
to
show
that
this
particular
remedy,
this
particular
affirmative
action
plan
actually
denies
any
non-minorities
any
promotions.
one
thing
is
clear
from
the
record.
that
is,
the
city
created
substantially
more
promotions,
and
this
is
conceded
by
the
petitioner.
the
city
created
substantially
more
promotions
to
accommodate
the
interests
of
both
minorities
and
non-minorities
alike,
and
there
is
no
indication
that
any
particular
non-minority
was
denied
a
promotion
in
favor
of
a
minority.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
that's
correct.
to
that
extent,
justice
rehnquist,
the
remedy
does
affect
who
gets
the
promotions.
my
point
is
simply
that
without
this
consent
decree,
the
non-minorities
would
not
have
received
the
promotions
anyway.
they
would
not
even
have
had
a
chance
for
the
promotions.
what
this
consent
decree
did
was
not
only
create
some
promotions
for
minorities,
but
it
also
created
many
more
non-minority
promotions.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
they
would
to
the
extent
to
which
the
grades
control
your
ranking
on
an
eligible
list.
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
they
would
be
filled
in
accordance
with
the
grade
scores
except
insofar
as
the
court...
the
affirmative
action
plan
embodied
in
the
consent
decree
requires
otherwise.
so
in
theory--
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
--well,
it
depends
on
the
given
list.
there
is
no
question
but
in
a
given
situation
a
non-minority
with
a
low
score
could
be
promoted--
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
--that
is
correct.
no
question
about
that.
this
is
not...
to
speak
to
qualifications,
no
one
achieves
a
place
on
the
eligible
list
without
passing
the
examination.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
more
than
minimally
qualified,
justice
white.
only
20
percent,
for
example,
on
the
'84...
20
percent
of
the
applicants
passed
the
1984
promotional
examination.
i
think
that
is
enhanced
qualifications,
if
anything.
not
only
that,
but
under
706(g),
the
city
of
cleveland,
the
rights,
the
prerogative
of
the
city
of
cleveland
under
706(g)
to
object
to
the
promotion
of
any
single
individual
in
the
last
sentence
of
706(g)
was
retained.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
no
seniority
system
is
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
much
has
been
said
about
706(g)
previously
this
afternoon.
i
would
like
to
add
a
couple
of
things.
first
of
all,
706(g)
simply...
the
last
sentence
of
that
paragraph
simply
has
no
application
here.
that
sentence
was
not
designed
to
deal
with
situations
such
as
we
have
here,
which
is
systemic
discrimination
over
the
years
both
at
a
hiring
level,
at
an
assignment
level,
and
also
at
a
promotion
level
such
that
the
violation
was
keyed
to
classes
rather
than
individuals.
the
court
found
that
an
entire
class
had
been
discriminated
against,
and
i
don't
think
706(g)
was
intended
to
reach
this
situation.
however--
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
--absolutely,
justice
o'connor.
the
limitations
would
be
equitable
limitations.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
no,
and
there
is
no
argument
that
there
are
equitable...
the
equitable
limitations
of
the
court
have
been
exceeded,
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
stotts
opinion
that
speaks
to
the
contrary.
the
stotts
opinion
in
our
view
is
a
competitive
seniority
opinion.
competitive
seniority
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
that's
correct,
justice
white.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
that
is
correct,
and
there
is
nothing
that
we
quarrel
with
in
that
discussion
because
what
706(g),
what
the
last
sentence
here
does
is
preserves
management's
prerogative
in
the
individual
case
to
say
that
person
x
is
not
in
fact
qualified.
it
reserves
that
prerogative.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
yes,
it
did.
it
found
past
discrimination.
the
city
admitted
past
discrimination.
the
city
admitted
not
only
past
discrimination
but
a
long
history
of
discrimination,
and
the
court
found
it,
and
local
93
didn't
challenge
it.
the
only...
they
put
on
one
exhibit,
which
spoke
to
the
remedy
question,
the
fairness
of
the
remedy.
it
put
on
one
witness
who
testified
to
the
fairness...
the
alleged
unfairness
of
the
remedy.
they
went
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
purely
an
abuse
of
discretion
ground.
they
argued
that
the
court
exceeded
its
equitable
powers
and
abused
its
discretion
in
approving
this
particular
consent
decree,
but
they
do
not
advance
that
challenge
here.
there
is
no
serious
debate
that
this
is
a
reasonable
approach
to
a
very,
very
serious
problem.
and
i
would
point
out
in
response...
and
i
am
coming
back
to
706(g)
for
a
moment.
the
last
sentence
of
706(g),
justice
brennan,
is
supported
by
what
congressman
seller
intended.
congressman
seller
did
sponsor
the
last
sentence
of
706(g).
it
is
clear
that
that
sentence
was
originally
a
for
cause
sentence,
and
that
for
cause
language
arose
from
a
1947
amendment
to
the
nlra,
and
if
one
looks
to
the
legislative
history
of
that
particular
provision,
it
is
clear
that
it
was
designed
to
preserve
management's
prerogative
to
object
to
the
lack
of
qualifications
of
any
single
individual.
we
believe
that
this
is
a
plain
language
case,
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
plain
language
or
in
the
legislative
history
for
that
matter
of
706(g)
that
prevents
this
particular
relief,
but
i
would
point
out
that
in
addition
to
that,
it
is
simply...
what
we
have
here
is
not
a
court
order.
it
is
our
contention
that
if
it
is
a
court
order,
it
is
purely
law.
but
it
is--
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
--certainly
it
does.
it
is
a
hybrid.
i
mean,
i
think
we
have
to
concede
it
is
a
hybrid.
justice
rehnquist,
i
noted
in
his
dissent
from
denial
of
cert
in
the
ashley
versus
city
of
jackson
case,
described
a
title
7
consent
decree
as
little
more
than
a
contract
between
the
parties
formalized
by
the
signature
of
a
judge.
but
we
concede
that
it
has
aspects
of
a
court
order.
the
court
signed
a
decree.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
well,
that
is
totally
irrelevant
under
these
circumstances,
justice
marshall.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
absolutely--
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
--your
honor--
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
--your
honor,
they--
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
--the
consent
was
between
the
plaintiff
and
the
defendants.
local
93--
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
--the
original
defendant...
the
original
defendants,
the
city
defendants
consented
and
the
plaintiffs
consented.
local
93
did
not
consent.
now,
local
93...
what
happened
was,
initially...
an
initial
consent
decree
was--
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
--they
intervened
as
a
party.
if
i
may
explain,
initially
there
was...
initially
after
the
action
was
brought
negotiations
ensued
between
the
plaintiff
and
the
defendant.
during
those
negotiations,
local
93
intervened.
what
emerged
from
that
was
the
first
proposed
consent
decree.
the
district
court
held...
that
was
not
the
same
as
the
consent
decree
that
was
ultimately
approved.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
no,
it
was
a
more
strenuous
consent
decree
but
it
was
not
a
45
percent
consent
decree.
what
happened
was,
evidentiary
hearings
were
held
on
that
first
proposed
consent
decree
for
four
days.
local
93
participated.
at
the
conclusion
of
those...
at
the
conclusion
of
those
hearings,
the
court
suggested
strongly
to
all
three
parties
that
they
sit
down
and
they
attempt
to
work
out
a
three-way
settlement,
and
that
is
what
we
did.
we
negotiated
a
three-way
settlement.
that
is
when
the
city
created
all
these
additional
promotional
positions.
we
thought
we
had
local
93's
agreement.
they
submitted
to
their
membership,
and
the
membership
said
no.
at
that
point
the
district
court
clearly
did
approve
that
same
three-way
negotiated
consent
decree
over
the
objections
of
local
93,
and
we
contend
that
that
issue,
their
lack
of
consent
is
in
essence
a
red
herring.
i
mean,
let's
look
at
the
alternatives
for
a
moment.
does
an
intervenor
whose
legal
rights
are
not
affected,
merely
whose
interests...
there
were
interests
clearly,
but
does
an
intervenor
whose
legal
rights
are
not
affected
have
the
right
to
block
a
settlement
between
two
principle
parties?
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
the
weber
decision,
we
submit,
is
controlling.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
that
is
not
a
question
that
is
argued
by
petitioner.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
my
response
is,
there
is
no
serious...
this
plan
meets
the
fourteenth
amendment
requirements,
number
one.
number
two--
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
--no,
this
court
has
spoken
to
that
question,
or
very
closely
to
that
question
in
fullilove
and
also
in
bache.
there
are
procedures
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
must
be
followed.
the
city
of
cleveland
clearly
here...
the
district
court
made
findings
of
a
long
history
of
discrimination.
there
is
no
question
but
what
there
were
findings.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
that's
correct.
that
is
absolutely
correct.
and
i
would
point
out...
my
response
on
the
question
of
public
versus
private,
number
one,
there
is
no
argument
here
from
the
other
side,
from
the
justice
department
or
from
mr.
summers
that
it
makes
a
difference,
and
secondly--
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
--they
in
fact
stipulate
that
question
away.
but
the
amici,
i
would
draw
your
honor's
attention...
particularly
the
city
of
atlanta
brief
addresses
that
question
head
on
in
the
history
of
the
extension
of
title
7
to
the
state
and
local
governments
in
1972.
it
seems
clear
that
there
was
no
intent
by
congress
to
draw
distinctions
in
terms
of
the
ability
of
an
employer,
whether
he
be
public
or
private,
to
engage
in
voluntary
compliance.
what
we
have
here
is
voluntary
compliance
at
root.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
it
can
under
section
703.
there
is
no
703
claim
here.
it
cannot,
obviously,
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it
has
no
final
say.
but
there
is
no
serious
debate
about
a
fourteenth
amendment
issue
here.
it
is
nowhere
to
be
seen
in
petitioner's
briefs,
for
example.
this
is
a
voluntary
compliance
case.
what
the
city
did
here...
no
one
held
a
gun
to
their
head,
and
admittedly
the
consent
decree
has
some
aspects
of
a
court
order.
there
is
no
question
about
it.
but
there
are
very
strong
reasons
why
this
court
should
apply
the
weber
standards
to...
should
treat
this
as
purely
voluntary
action.
the
pivotal
fact
in
weber,
namely
that
the
employer
voluntarily
agreed
to
the
plan,
is
present
here.
secondly,
it
does
not
affect
whether
the
weber
standards
are
applied.
whether
this
is
treated
as
a
court
order,
a
consent
decree,
or
is
a
voluntary
affirmative
action,
it
really
does
not
impact
on
local
93's
right.
they
have
the
same
right
to
challenge
the
lawfulness
of
the
plan
in
either
instance.
in
the
purely
voluntary
plan
situation,
for
example,
they
bring
an
independent
action,
and
once
they
bring
that
action
and
they
litigate
those
issues,
they
can't
file
a
second
action
and
relitigate
them.
similarly
here...
i
realize
that
my
time
is
up,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i
would
simply
add,
if
i
may,
and
i
have
the
understanding
of
my
colleague
that
i
may
complete
my
thought,
it
simply
does
not
make
a
difference
to
third
parties
whether
they
file
a
separate
independent
action
or
whether
they
frame
their
objections
as
they
did
here
within
the
context
of
an
intervention,
in
a
fairness
hearing,
in
framing
their
lawfulness
objections,
and
they
are
precluded
from
relitigating
and
filing
a
second
action
to
relitigate
those
same
issues.
there
are
advantages
to
a
consent
decree,
and
consistent
with
the
strong
views
of
congress
in
title
7
to
favor
and
encourage
voluntary
compliance
with
the
act,
we
urge
this
court
to
treat
this
particular
affirmative
action
plan
as
a
measure
of
voluntary
compliance.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
absolutely
correct,
and
there
is
no
question
about
the
court's
jurisdiction
here.
there
is
a
question
raised
about
the
applicability
of
the
last
sentence
of
706(g)
to
a
consent
decree,
and
i
would
merely
point
out
that
if
one
construes
the
last
sentence
of
706(g)
to
preclude
a
consent
decree
in
this
context,
if
you
adopt...
if
you
take
literally
the
argument
that
is
being
advanced
by
the
other
side
in
this
case,
and
you
look
at
the
last
sentence
of
706(g),
you
will
conclude
that
even
if
local
93
had
consented
to
this
particular
decree,
it
would
have
been
barred,
and
i
suggest--
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
--my
interpretation
is--
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
--well,
i
would
say
that,
but
it
is
clearly
not
necessary
to
reach
that
question,
because
706(g)
is
not--
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
--well,
there
are
two
issues
on
the
construction
of
706(g),
number
one,
whether
it
authorizes
this
as
a
matter
of
court-imposed
remedies,
number
one,
and
number
two,
whether
there
is
anything
in
706(g)
that
bars
the
parties
from
voluntarily
agreeing,
and
on
that
latter
question,
i
would
urge
the
court
to
take
into
consideration
the
fact
that
if
local
93
were
to
have
even
consented
to
this
consent
decree,
that
under
their
interpretation
the
last
sentence
of
706(g)
would
bar
it.
i
apologize
to
the
court
and
to
mr.
maddox
for
taking
part
of
his
time.
thank
you.
