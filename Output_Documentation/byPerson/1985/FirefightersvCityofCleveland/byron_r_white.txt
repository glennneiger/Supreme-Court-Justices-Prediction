even
as
against
those
members
who
voted
against
confirming
the
consent
decree?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
no.
say
a
majority
of
the
union
voted
for
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
dissenters,
would
dissenters
be
bound?
justice
byron
r.
white
may
i
ask
a
little
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
you
still
have
to
convince
us
as
to
what
the
last
sentence
of
706(g)
means.
you
said
it,
but--
justice
byron
r.
white
--do
you
think
it
is
subject
to
some
other
construction?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
discriminated
in
favor
of
those
who
were
not--
justice
byron
r.
white
--of
those
who
were
not--
justice
byron
r.
white
--do
you
suggest
that
giving
relief,
a
court's
giving
relief
to
nonvictims
itself
violates
title
7?
or
is
it
just
an
excessive
remedy?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
it
does?
is
it
just
an
invalid
remedy,
or
does
that
violate
title
7?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
just
an
invalid
remedy.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
have
to
be.
would
have
to
be
promoted.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
they
all
have...
you
can
all
say
that
they
are
minimally
qualified
but
they
are
ranked.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
seniority
have
anything
to
do
with
who
was
entitled
to
a
promotion?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
stotts
does
talk
about
the
policy,
the
remedial
policy
of
706(g),
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
says
at
least
that
its
result
is
consistent
with
that
policy,
which
is
as
follows.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
are
justifying
this
on
the
basis
of
a
remedy
for
past
discrimination.
that
is
your
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
706(g)
said
that
no
court
order
may
include
a,
b,
c,
which
is
precisely
what
this
consent
decree
included.
you
would
say
under
your
argument
the
consent
decree
is
nevertheless
valid.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
right?
even
if
706(g)
expressly
prevented
what
is
in
this
decree,
you
would
say
the
consent
decree
must
stand.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
is
if
we
agree
with
the
government
on
what
the
construction
of
706(g)
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
is
the
submission
of
the
other
side,
there
may
be
no
race-conscious--
justice
byron
r.
white
--i
hadn't
understood
they
went
that
far.
they
certainly
are
saying
relief
should
be
given
only
to
victims.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
we
could
assume
and
it
may
be
true
that
all
of
them
are
non-victims,
or
that
all
of
them
are
victims.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
for
you
to
win
you
should
win
on
either
assumption.
