mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
as
mr.
summers
stated,
the
question
that
is
raised
by
this
case
is
purely
one
of
statutory
construction,
whether
a
judicial
order
entered
with
the
consent
of
the
employer
is
subject
to
the
remedial
limitations
imposed
by
section
706(g)
of
title
7.
section
706(g)
prescribes
all
remedial
orders,
all
remedial
court
orders
that
grant
preferential
treatment
to
nonvictims
of
discrimination.
this
victim-specific
limitation
on
a
court's
title
7
remedial
power
is
in
no
way
relaxed
where
the
employer
consents
to
the
entry
of
the
decree.
neither
the
language
nor
the
legislative
history
of
section
706(g)
lends
itself
to
a
selective
reading
of
the
phrase,
"no
order
of
the
court",
and
it
is
simply
not
the
case
that
the
explicit
statutory
constraint
on
a
court's
authority
to
order
into
place
one
discriminatory
selection
process
to
counteract
another,
that
that
constraint
can
be
bargained
away
at
the
expense
of
innocent
third
parties
by
an
employer
who
considers
it
to
be
in
its
interest
to
consent
to
a
decree
that
provides
for
discrimination
in
reverse.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
mr.
justice
white,
i...
i
am
sorry.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
there
had
been
proposed
in
some
of
the
briefs
some
different
ways
to
parse
the
words
that
might
suggest
that
it
doesn't
mean
that
there
is
a
limitation
on--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--the
no
order
of
the--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--706(g).
he
was
one
of
the
sponsors.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that's
correct.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
believe
that
was
his
view,
and
that
was
the
view
of--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--i
think
the
legislative
history
of
that
sentence
and
the
discussion
in
the
senate--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--i
think
representative
seller
made
a
number
of
comments
about
this
sentence
and
what
it
means
in
the
legislative
debates,
and
i
think
that
the
overwhelming
import
of
what
his
understanding
was
is
that
this
sentence
barred
the
awarding
of
relief
to
those
who
were
not
victims
of
discrimination.
there
was
a
delicate
balance
that
was
struck
by
congress
in
706(g).
it
was
a
balance
that
was
designed
to
ensure
that
those
who
were
victims
of
discrimination
were
made
whole,
but
also
to
ensure
that
you
would
not
discriminate
against
those
who
were
not
victims.
the
fundamental
purpose
of
the
statute
has...
this
court
has
recognized
time
and
again.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
it
was,
you
would
not
discriminate
in
favor.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
who
were
not
victims.
that
is
correct.
the
purpose
of
the
statute
was...
the
primary
purpose
was,
one,
to
eradicate
discrimination,
and
the
secondary
purpose,
as
this
court
has
recognized
over
again,
was
to
make
whole
victims
of
discrimination.
preferential
selection
arrangements
such
as
the
one
here
go
contrary
to
both
those
purposes.
they
do
not
eradicate
discrimination,
but
they
instead
promote
discrimination
and
further
discrimination.
they
are
themselves
discriminatory.
they
are
not
aimed
to
make
whole
relief.
indeed,
they
a
re
wholly
indifferent
to
make
whole
relief
for
victims.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
don't
think
that
the
court
can
give
relief
to
nonvictims
of
the
discrimination.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
if
a
court
orders
it?
if
a
court
requires
that
you
give
relief
to
somebody
who
is
not
a
victim
of
the
discrimination?
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
if
that
is
the
specific
requirement
of
the
order,
that
it
is
invalid
under
706(g)
and
the--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--that
is
right.
it
goes
beyond
the
authority
of
the
court.
it
will
indeed
be
the
case
that
the
court
can
fashion
relief
that
is
neutral
as
to
race,
that
will
have
the
benefit
of
advantaging
some
of
those
who
have
not
been
victims
of
discrimination.
for
example,
an
affirmative
action
recruitment
program
that
reaches
out
to
those
people
who
were
not
reached
before
and
allows
them
to
come
in
and
compete
will
give
them
an
advantage
they
didn't
have
when
they
were
excluded
from
the
recruitment.
that
certainly
would
be
a
permissible
remedy,
but
i
don't
think
that
the
courts
can
order
relief
under
title
7
that
gives
an
advantage
to
somebody
who
has
not
been
victimized
by
the
discriminatory
conduct,
and
do
so
within
the
authorization
that
congress
gave
by
the
statutory
provision.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
the
effect
of
the
decree
and
its
operation
would,
i
think,
deny
to
some
union
members
who
were
eligible
for
promotion
the
ability
to
be
promoted
solely
by
reason
of
their
race.
it
would
exclude
them
from
promotions
because
of
race.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
that
this
decree
does
require
that
you
promote
blacks
without
regard
to
their
qualifications.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
specified
numbers,
well,
percentages.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that
is
the
way
that
the
decree
was
written
and
it
was
to
operate,
and
indeed
the
way
it
did
operate.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
the
record
of
this
case
in
terms
of
how
it
has
operated,
i
think
that
this
case
comes
to
court
before
the
time...
the
record
was
developed
in
this
case
before
the
time
the
promotions
actually
took
place.
so
that
as
to
what
happened
with
regard
to
the
promotions
under
this
decree,
that
is
not
part
of
the
record
that
is
before
this
court.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
don't
know,
mr.
justice
stevens,
but
it
certainly
would
be
within...
it
certainly
would
be
very
possible
that
there
were
black
officers
who
had
not
been
promoted
by
reason
of
qualifications,
that
is,
for
some
reason
other
than
race,
who
would
by
virtue
of
this
decree,
would
indeed
have
the
promotion
award
to
them
in
order
to
fill
the
percentages.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
think
this
language...
as
i
say,
i
think
one
can
parse
this
language
in
several
different
ways
which
requires
us
to
turn
to
the
legislative
history.
i
think
it
is
clear
from
the
legislative
history
what
the
intention
was
of
this
language,
and
that
it
was
in
706(g)
to
ensure
that
you
would
not
have
courts
giving
preferential
treatment
for
purposes
of
achieving
or
maintaining
racial
balance.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
certainly
think
that
we
do
need
to
look
at
the
legislative
history.
my
own
reading
of
the
language
itself
leaves
me
with
less
doubts,
but
i
can
understand
that
it
can
be
parsed
the
way
you
are
suggesting,
and
i
think
the
legislative
history
removes
all
doubts
on
that
score.
i
believe
my
time
is
up.
