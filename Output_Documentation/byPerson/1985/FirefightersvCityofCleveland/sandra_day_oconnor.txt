justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
explain
how
the
union
is
bound
by
the
consent
decree
since
it
didn't
consent?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
if
the
union
had
consented
to
the
decree?
would
it
then
have
been
valid
in
all
respects
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
it
have
been
valid
had
the
union
consented
to
it?
could
you
just
answer
that
question?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
want
to
change
your
answer
to
my
earlier
question?

counsel,
if
there
had
been
no
voluntary
agreement,
and
if
there
had
been
no
consent
decree,
but
the
case
had
gone
to
trial,
do
you
think
the
court
could
have
ordered
precisely
the
same
remedial
scheme
as
was
developed
here
for
the
consent
decree?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
don't
see
anything
in
the
stotts
opinion
that
would
be
contrary
to
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
has
effects
different
from
a
voluntary
settlement,
doesn't
it?
