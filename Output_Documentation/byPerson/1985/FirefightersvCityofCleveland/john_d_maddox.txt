mr.
john
d.
maddox
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
petitioner
and
the
department
of
justice
would
resolve
this
case
as
a
simple
one
of
numbers.
the
number
they
want
you
to
impose
is
zero,
no
race-conscious
relief.
that
is
their
preference
today.
i
am
here
to
tell
you
what
the
city
of
cleveland
and
state
and
local
governments'
perspective
is
on
the
numbers
that
are
important,
i
think,
to
understanding
this
case.
in
1972,
when
congress
extended
the
reach
to
state
and
local
governments
and
empowered
the
justice
department,
the
justice
department
in
the
next
eleven
years
settled
88
percent
of
those
cases
by
a
consent
decree
like
the
one
we
have
today.
that
is
not
quite
right.
not
like
the
one
we
have
today,
and
the
reason
is,
if
you
look
at
the
materials
filed
with
the
court,
the
favorite
number
of
the
justice
department
in
all
those
years
was
50
percent.
that
is
the
ratio
they
liked.
that
is
the
race-conscious
relief
they
liked.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
recently
as
1983,
in
the
san
diego
county
case,
the
justice
department
approved
60
percent
race
conscious
relief.
mr.
john
d.
maddox
i
think,
your
honor,
that
in
looking
at
the
governmental
authority
which
congress
has
delegated
to
enforce
the
statute
and
their
construction
of
the
statute,
that
helps
the
court
in
formulating
what
congress'
intent
was.
another
example.
in
this
case
every
governmental
amicus
has
filed
on
behalf
of
the
side
of
the
city
of
cleveland.
not
one
has
filed
on
behalf
of
the
side
of
petitioner.
the
city
of
cleveland
during
that
time
was
just
like
many
of
the
other
cities
confronted
with
meeting
its
obligations
under
federal
law.
for
14
years,
as
is
indicated
in
this
record,
we
had
the
sealco
case
filed
in
1972,
we
had
the
heddon
case,
which
was
firefighters,
in
1973,
adjudications
by
federal
district
judges
of
violations
of
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
amendments
in
1981
and
1983,
title
7
not
involved
in
those
cases.
in
1977,
judge
manos
also
made
such
a
finding,
so
when
this
case
was
filed
in
1980,
the
city
of
cleveland
had
eight
years
at
that
point
of
litigating
these
types
of
cases,
and
eight
years
of
having
judges
rule
against
the
city
of
cleveland.
you
don't
have
to
beat
us
on
the
head.
we
finally
learned
what
we
had
to
do
and
what
we
had
to
try
to
do
to
comply
with
the
law,
and
it
was
the
intent
of
the
city
to
comply
with
the
law
fully
in
entering
this
consent
agreement.
we
were
faced
again
with
claims
under
the
thirteenth,
fourteenth
amendments,
1981,
1983,
and
title
7.
we
had
already
been
adjudicated
under
all
of
those
other
provisions
not
included
in
title
7
of
discrimination,
and
the
exact
type
of
relief
afforded
in
this
case
was
imposed
on
the
city.
the
question
here
is,
can
cities
and
local
governments
and
defendants
be
able
to
settle
these
types
of
cases?
i
submit
that
it
is
essential
that
we
be
able
to
settle
them,
and
i
don't
think
we
can
with
the
construction
of
706(g)
which
is
being
urged
by
the
department
of
justice.
i
think
the
706(g)
construction
of
the
legislative
intent
regarding
706(g)
was
best
expressed
by
the
justice
department
in
1979
in
their
brief
in
this
case,
in
weber.
in
that
case,
they
said,
section
706(g)
provides
substantial
support
for
the
proposition
that
congress
intended
numerical
race-conscious
relief
is
available
under
title
7
to
remedy
employment
discrimination.
that
is
the
justice
department's
brief
in
weber
at
page
35.
this
is
a
case
to
remedy
the
effects
of
discrimination.
that
is
not
make
whole
relief
under
which
there
is
any
sort
of
limitation
under
706(g).
the
plain
reading
of
706(g),
i
think,
supports
that.
the
focus
has
been
on
the
last
sentence.
i
do
not
believe
that
proper
statutory
construction
allows
one
to
ignore
the
first
sentence.
in
the
first
sentence
it
says,
if
the
court
finds
that
respondent,
focusing
on
the
employer.
the
first
sentence
doesn't
talk
about
individuals.
it
is
talking
about
a
different
problem.
it
is
talking
about
race-conscious
prospective
relief.
if
the
court
finds
that
respondent
has
intentionally
engaged
or
is
intentionally
engaging
in
unlawful
employment
practices,
and
i
paraphrase
and
skip
down,
affirmative
action...
that
term
is
used
in
dealing
with
respondents...
as
may
be
appropriate,
which
may
include
but
is
not
limited
to,
and
it
lists
certain
types
of
affirmative
action,
or
any
other
equitable
relief
as
the
court
may
deem
appropriate.
it
is
clear
to
me,
i
believe,
as
it
was
to
the
justice
department
in
1979
that
congress
did
not
mean
to
strip
federal
district
courts
of
their
equitable
authority
to
deal
with
these
types
of
complex
problems.
how
complex
are
they?
this
type
of
remedy,
as
is
evident
from
the
record
in
this
case,
has
been
used
regularly
and
has
been
approved
by
every
single
court
of
appeals.
not
one
has
said
that
race-conscious
prospective
relief
is
inappropriate
either
under
title
7
or
under
1981
in
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
now,
the
policy
that
is
being
urged
that
there
can
be
no
prospective
race-conscious
relief
in
my
opinion
reduces
title
7
to
little
more
than
an
employment
torts
claims
act.
they
talk
about
make
whole,
victim-specific.
none
of
that
language
appears
in
706(g).
if
you
take
that
approach,
it
will
severely
hamper,
i
think,
congressional
intent
that
the
federal
agencies
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
alleviating
such
discrimination
of
the
state
and
local
governments
who
they
encourage
to
resolve
these
matters
of
courts'
abilities
to
deal
with
these
problems,
all
would
be
severely
handicapped
in
terms
of
eliminating
systemic
historical
discrimination
in
institutions.
this
cannot
be
the
policy
i
do
not
think
that
this
court
should
find
underlying
and
not
expressed.
congress
wanted
to
eliminate
the
effects
of
historical
discrimination.
what
would
be
the
result
of
saying
there
could
be
no
race
conscious
prospective
relief?
one,
i
think,
it
would
frustrate
congress's
intent
as
set
forth
in
this--
mr.
john
d.
maddox
--yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
is
their
suggestion.
there
may
be
no
race-conscious
prospective
relief
to
eliminate
historical
discrimination.
certainly
that
is
the
justice
department.
it
is
not
clear
from
mr.
summers--
mr.
john
d.
maddox
--that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
that
is
contrary
and
not
consistent
with
race-conscious
prospective
relief,
which
does
not
focus
on
the
victims,
but
focuses
on
the
respondent,
as
is
said
in
the
first
sentence
of
706(g),
focuses
on
the
institution
and
what
steps
must
be
taken
to
alleviate
discrimination
in
that
institution.
now,
i
think--
mr.
john
d.
maddox
--some
may
be.
some
may
not
be.
it
was
not
necessary
to
determine
that
in
this
case
because
the
plaintiff
class
voluntarily
gave
up
any
claim
to
make
whole
relief,
although
they
put
it
in
their
complaint.
they
wanted
the
prospective
race-conscious
and
the
city
after
two
years
of
negotiations
agreed
with
that
tradeoff,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
maddox
you
could
assume
either
way,
your
honor,
and
that
particular
point
is
not
relevant
to
race-conscious
prospective
relief.
mr.
john
d.
maddox
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
now,
the
ramifications
of
reaching
the
justice
department's
result
in
my
opinion
will
be
an
increase
in
the
judicial
workload,
one,
because
there
necessarily
will
be
more
cases
filed,
and
we
won't
be
able
to
settle
these
cases.
mr.
john
d.
maddox
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
negotiations
resulted
in
a
very
fair
allocation
of
any
sort
of
burden.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
you
compare
the
first
consent
decree
with
the
second
consent
decree,
we
added
more
than
the
number
of
non-minority
promotions
to
make
up
for
the
number
of
promotions
that
existed
under
the
prior
consent
decree.
not
one
non-minority
did
not
get
promoted
in
the
initial
waves
of
promotions
because
of
that
consent
decree.
the
city
took
the
burden.
we
made
more
promotions
than
we
wanted
to
make.
we
made
more
promotions,
in
fact,
than
we
needed
to
make
in
order
to
work
with
the
trial
judge
to
accommodate
and
minimize
the
burden
in
this
case.
i
think
other
potential
ramifications
here
will
be
an
increased
disruption,
and
that
is
the
most
important
thing
to
us
here
today,
the
disruption
of
state
and
local
governments'
ability
to
run
a
fire
department,
as
happened
in
this
case.
the
judge
impounded
the
examinations
for
two
years.
in
other
cases,
we
have
had
preliminary
injunctions
for
two
years.
you
cannot
run
and
operate
a
safety
force
by
having
such
judicial
disruption,
however
well
justified
or
intended.
this
consent
order
alleviated
that
for
the
period
of
four
to
five
years,
so
that
we
could
attempt
to
make
the
promotions
that
both
minority
and
non-minority
wanted
here.
i
do
not
think
this
court
wishes
to
adopt
a
procedure
or
policy
which
will
inhibit
defendants
from
settling
these
types
of
cases.
it
is
clear
to
me
that
congressional
intent
was
and
should
be
to
settle
these
cases,
to
work
those
problems
out
at
the
local
level.
judge
lambrose,
who
handled
this
case
in
the
trial
court,
was
very
experienced
in
handling
these
cases.
as
is
evident
in
williams
versus
vukovich,
he
denied
a
consent
order,
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
that
denial.
so,
he
is
not
a
judge
that
is
not
very
considerate
of
the
equities
to
everyone,
and
he
certainly
was
very
sensitive
to
them
in
this
case.
in
summary,
i
think
this
court
should
adhere
to
the
language
in
milliken
that
the
court
in
fashioning
a
remedy
should
be
sensitive
to
the
needs
of
state
and
local
governments.
the
trial
court
did
that
here.
we
believe
this
court
should
do
that
also.
the
court
below
should
be
affirmed.
