well,
mr.
reynolds,
apart
from
the
briefs,
congressman
seller
was
the
sponsor
of
that
last
sentence,
wasn't
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
last
sentence
of
706(g).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
and
he
suggests
that
that
bars
any
relief
except
for
some
victim
of
discrimination.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
wasn't
his
view
of
it,
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
the
last
sentence,
bars
an
order
of
hiring
or
otherwise
for
anyone
suspended
or
discharged
for
any
reason
other
than
discrimination
on
account
of
race.
doesn't
that
mean
it
bars...
or
rather
addresses
the
situation
where
an
employer
refuses
to
hire
for
some
reason
other
than
race?
isn't
that
what
it
says?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
am
addressing
my...
i
am
asking,
isn't
that
what
representative
seller
said?
