mr.
william
l.
summers
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
petitioner
here
questions
whether
or
not
the
district
court
below
is
empowered
by
the
congress
of
these
united
states
to
award
quota
relief
and
promotions
to
a
class
of
persons
none
of
whom
had
ever
been
shown
to
be
specific
victims
of
any
past
promotional
discriminatory
practices
of
the
city
of
cleveland.
reviewing
the
decisions
of
this
court
together
with
the
clear
and
absolute
legislative
intent
of
congress,
it
seems
to
us,
as
we
have
steadfastly
maintained,
this
court
ordered
remedy
below
was
not
lawful.
this
is
purely
a
question
of
statutory
construction.
there
was
in
fact
a
consent
decree
in
this
matter.
that
consent
decree
was
negotiated
from
the
very
beginning
between
the
city
of
cleveland
and
the
vanguards.
the
matter
was
filed
in
district
court
in
the
fall
of
1980,
and
intervention
was
not
sought
as
a
matter
of
right
by
the
intervenors,
the
local
which
i
represent
here
today,
until
the
spring
of
1981,
and
it
was
in
fact
granted
together
with
the
filing
of
our
responsive
pleading.
negotiations
continued
between
the
city
of
cleveland
and
the
vanguards
to
the
exclusion
of
local
93
until
roughly
november
of
1981.
in
november
of
1981,
a
proposed
consent
decree
in
draft
form
was
presented
to
me
as
counsel
for
the
intervenors,
and
a
quick
meeting
thereafter
was
held
in
the
chambers
of
the
united
states
district
court.
initially
it
was
said
to
have
"approved
the
fairness
of
the
proposed
consent
decree.
"
at
that
time,
the
united
states
district
court
said,
wait
a
minute.
i
have
allowed
this
union
in.
i
want
this
union
to
participate,
and
i
want
them
to
have
full
participation.
we
did
in
fact
have
full
participation
in
the
negotiation
process
to
our
knowledge
from
that
point
on.
in
the
fall
of
1982,
due
to
the
illness
of
our
trial
judge,
the
magistrate
took
over
the
negotiating
process
and,
yes,
long
and
arduous,
as
both
briefs
have
stated,
discussions,
negotiating
sessions
were
had
towards
the
possibility
of
a
consent
decree.
i
might
add
to
you,
however,
that
from
the
very
beginning
the
position
of
this
local
union
was
the
imposition
of
quota
remedy
relief
against
any
of
its
members
was
in
fact
an
unlawful
exercise
of
title
7.
while
it
was
not
articulated
as
such,
they
said
that
they
felt
that
the
quota
relief
in
any
form
in
preference,
racial
preference
of
any
individual
over
another
was
not
lawful,
and
that
that...
certainly
the
lawfulness
of
that
would
be
derived
from
706(g).
this
court
order
became
a
consent
decree
in
the
absence
of
the
signature
of
this
local.
the
membership
of
that
local,
almost
90
percent
of
it,
rejected
this
consent
decree
because
of
the
very
quota
relief
which
was
contained
therein.
it
was
entered
over
their
objections,
and
i
add
to
you
that
in
seeking
the
imprimatur
of
the
district
court
by
way
of
an
attempt
to
utilize
the
district
court,
its
attendant
jurisdictional
powers,
its
contempt
powers,
and
everything
else,
the
city
of
cleveland,
certainly
with
a
keen
interest
in
not
having
any
back
pay
awards,
chose
to
settle
the
alleged
discriminatory
wrongs
in
the
past
on
the
backs
of
the
innocent
non-minority
firefighters.
we
felt
that
was
wrong.
we
feel
that
is
wrong
as
we
stand
before
you
today.
mr.
william
l.
summers
the
consent,
mr.
chief
justice,
was
entered
by
the
city
of
cleveland
and
the
minority
firefighters,
being
the
vanguards.
signature
was
withheld
on
behalf
of
my
client.
that
was
done
by
mandate,
the
mandate
of
the
membership,
if
you
will.
mr.
william
l.
summers
sir,
not
really
veto
power.
first
of
all,
i
believe
under
case
law,
the
vukovich
case
out
of
our
circuit,
that
once
this
became
a
matter
within
the
district
court,
once
this
became
a
court
order
under
title
7,
that
collateral
attack
was
precluded
by
anyone,
and
therefore
a...
in
comparing
it,
if
you
will,
to
weber
in
the
private
sector,
that
challenge
by
brian
weber
was
not
precluded
because
that
affirmative
action
plan
entered
into
between
that
union
and
that
employer
did
not
preclude
collateral
attack,
and
brian
weber
in
fact
did
make
his
collateral
attack,
but
here,
where
you
have
it
as
a
court
order,
certainly
collateral
attack
was
prevented.
mr.
william
l.
summers
yes,
he
would
have
been
able
to...
had
he
not
sought
intervention,
i
am
assuming
your
question
has
within
it,
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
l.
summers
if
he
had
intervened,
no,
he
would
not.
he
would
have
been
precluded
from
challenging,
since
intervention
was
granted
on
behalf
of
his
collective
bargaining
representative.
mr.
william
l.
summers
it
is
bound
by
the
consent
decree...
first
of
all,
any
state
or
collateral
attack...
for
example,
there
was
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
this
that
is
recited,
and
i
have
lodged
that
just
recently
with
this
court.
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
said
that
the
city
was
bound
to
follow
all
of
the
specific
rules
and
regulations
of
the
civil
service
commission
which
therefore
became
attendant
upon
the
charter
of
the
city
of
cleveland
and
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
ohio.
once
this
became
a
united
states
district
court
order,
that
was
precluded.
mr.
william
l.
summers
then
i
believe
that
you
still
must
look
at
the
fact...
well,
that
would
be
a
more
close
situation
to
the
weber
matter,
your
honor,
and
in
that
situation
you
have
full,
really
full
representation,
and
you
have
really
full
consent,
ergo
the
minority
firefighters
negotiated
and
consented,
the
city
of
cleveland
negotiated
and
consented,
and
local
93
would
have
negotiated
and
consented.
absent
that
consent,
you
don't
have
a
real
consent
decree,
but
you
certainly
do
have
an
order
of
court.
mr.
william
l.
summers
yes.
mr.
william
l.
summers
in
all
honesty,
mr.
justice
white,
i
would
certainly
think
that
if
a
union
president
were
to
affix
his
signature
there
in
the
face
of
a
90
percent
rejection--
mr.
william
l.
summers
--yes.
mr.
william
l.
summers
they
would
be
bound,
but
yet
the
remedy
is
still
above
the
scope
of--
mr.
william
l.
summers
--well,
they
would
certainly
be
more
precluded,
if
you
will,
than
in
the
situation
that
we
have
at
hand.
mr.
william
l.
summers
i
do
the
best
i
can,
judge.
mr.
william
l.
summers
yes.
mr.
william
l.
summers
in
all
due
honesty,
justice
stevens,
if
the
remedy
is
improper,
the
remedy
is
improper
wherever
it
is
handed.
mr.
william
l.
summers
that's
correct.
mr.
william
l.
summers
i
guess
i
am
going
to
have
to.
the
court
order
here,
there
has
been
great
light
made
of
whether
or
not
this
court
order
is
the
same
court
order
as
if
there
had
been
a
full
adjudication
of
the
underlying
discrimination.
i
think
that
is
a
question
that
this
court
not
address
at
this
time.
i
think
the
question...
and
for
purposes
of
these
facts
of
this
case,
the
petitioners
in
assumption
fashion
will
assume
that
there
would
have
been
an
underlying
general
finding
of
discrimination.
first,
you
have
to
have
that,
whether
it
is
by
agreement
or
whether
or
not
it
is
by
a
fully
litigated
matter.
if
you
have
a
fully
litigated
matter,
you
certainly
have
the
opportunity
at
a
later
date
under
teamsters
and
franks
versus
bowman
to
come
back
and
individually
identify
victims.
if
you
just
have
a
mere
caving
in,
if
you
will,
as
the
city
did
here,
to
bargain
away
the
rights
of
the
innocent
non-minorities'
promotions,
instead
of
paying
back
pay,
then
you
certainly
do
not
have
the
parameters
and
the
specific
acts
of
violation
which
an
innocent
minority
could
come
in
and
say,
look,
i
was
harmed,
and
here
is
how
i
was
harmed,
and
the
district
court
would
have
before
that
that
adjudication,
that
finding
hearing
wherein
there
were
specific
examples
shown,
and
the
court
would
certainly
have
that
background
before
it
to
make
that
determination.
the
claims
of
the...
as
i
say,
this
is
not
a
weber
type
agreement,
because
weber
in
fact
did
have
all
the
parties
represented
and
all
the
parties
agreeing.
as
i
said
in
the
list
line
of
the
introductory
paragraph
to
my
presentation,
we
stand
before
you
today.
we
think
we
understand
what
this
court's
majority
ruled
in
stotts.
we
think
we
understand
the
language
that
was
written
in
franks
versus
bowman.
we
believe
truly
that
we
understand
the
language
in
teamsters.
this
legislation...
and
the
question
was
made
of
the
comments
of
senators
chase
and
clark.
for
the
record,
in
1964,
and,
of
course,
senators
clark
and
case
were
captains
of
title
7
in
the
senate,
they
stated
in
an
interpretive
memo,
"no
court
order
can
require
hiring,
reinstatement,
admission
to
membership,
or
payment
of
back
pay
for
anyone
who
was
not
discriminated
against
in
violation
of
this
title.
"
this
is
stated
expressly
in
the
last
sentence
of
706(g).
the
chief
sponsor,
who
appeared
in
the
house
as
well
to
discuss
it,
senator
humphrey,
"contrary
to
the
allegations
of
some
opponents
of
this
title,
there
is
nothing
in
it
that
will
give
any
power
to
the
commission
or
to
any
court
to
require
hiring,
firing,
or
promotion
of
employees
in
order
to
meet
a
racial
quota
or
to
achieve
a
certain
racial
balance.
"
"that
bugaboo
has
been
brought
up
a
dozen
times,
but
it
is
nonexistent.
"
he
introduced
an
explanation
of
the
house
bill
in
the
senate
which
he
said
had
been
read
and
approved
by
the
bipartisan
floor
manager
of
the
bill
in
both
houses
of
congress,
and
in
pertinent
part
the
explanation
provided,
"the
relief
available
is
a
court
order
enjoining
the
offender
from
engaging
further
in
discriminatory
practices,
and
directing
the
offender
to
take
appropriate
affirmative
action,
for
example,
reinstating
or
hiring
employees
with
or
without
back
pay.
"
"the
title
does
not
provide
that
any
preferential
treatment
in
employment
shall
be
given
to
negroes
or
to
any
other
persons
or
groups.
"
"it
does
not
provide
that
any
quota
systems
may
be
established
to
maintain
racial
balance
in
employment.
"
mr.
william
l.
summers
yes,
i
am.
mr.
william
l.
summers
mr.
justice
blackmun,
that
is
a
very
difficult
question,
but
i
think
that
the
principles
that
senator
humphrey
stood
for
were
strong
enough
that
if
he
felt
the
necessity
for
quota
relief
in
1985,
he
would
do
everything
within
his
power
on
the
floor
of
congress
to
see
that
those
words
were
in
fact
added
to
this
title,
and
in
explaining
on
so
many
occasions
before
that
very
same
congress
that
congress
was
not
giving
that
power
to
the
courts
of
this
united
states
nor
to
the
equal
opportunity
commission,
i
think
he
made
it
very
clear
what
the
intent
of
that
bill
was
at
that
time,
and
in
knowing
his
job
the
way
he
knew
it,
if
it
were
necessary
to
change
it,
he
would
see
that
the
possibility
would
have
every
opportunity
to
come
about,
and
would
certainly
not
expect
this
court
to
do
so.
going
on
to
paraphrase,
the
relief
available,
and
this
is
senator
humphrey
again,
is
a
court
order
enjoining
the
offender
from
engaging
further
in
discriminatory
practices,
and
that
is
by
necessity
what
must
happen
in
the
employment
of
quota
relief.
discrimination
must
go
on,
and
directing
the
offender
to
take
appropriate
affirmative
action,
for
example,
reinstating
or
hiring
employees
with
or
without
back
pay.
the
title
does
not
provide
that
any
preferential
treatment
in
employment
shall
be
given
to
negroes
or
to
any
other
persons
or
groups.
i
reemphasize
this.
i
repeat
this
because
he
said
it.
great
light
has
been
made,
and
i
say
to
you,
by
various
amici
that
in
1972,
for
example,
the
failure
of
the
ervin
amendment
signaled
the
defeat
of
the
proposition.
could
it
possibly
in
defeating
an
amendment
to
a
bill,
congress
not
speaking,
could
it
possibly
defeat
the
intention
of
congress
so
specifically
stated
in
500
and
some
pages
of
congressional
record
for
the
enactment
of
title
7
that
congress
through
its
normal
means,
through
the
means
of
negotiation,
enacted
this
bill,
and
this
bill
was
to
provide
make
whole
relief.
in
1972
they
chose
to
include
state
and
federal
governments,
and
they
added,
yes,
a
sentence
at
the
end.
that
sentence
at
the
end
did
in
fact
mean
appropriate
relief
to
take
whole
victims
of
past
discrimination
where
they
truly
have
been
identified.
i
have
reserved
five
minutes
at
the
end,
and
i
would
concede
to
mr.
reynolds
for
the
justice
department.
mr.
william
l.
summers
mr.
chief
justice,
mr.
maddox
on
behalf
of
the
city
of
cleveland
seems
to
look
towards
the
position
of
the
justice
department
and
allow
singularly
our
claim
to
be
one
of...
not
that
important,
but
it
certainly
seems
to
me
that
from
the
beginning
and
in
the
complaint
which
is
in
this
joint
appendix
which
prayed
for
dollar
back
pay
relief,
this
city
of
cleveland,
he,
the
law
director
of
the
city
of
cleveland,
saw
a
way
around
it.
i
will
give
the
jobs
away
of
the
innocent
non-minorities,
and
i
won't
have
to
pay
any
back
pay
awards.
he
didn't
answer
that
for
you.
when
he
says
to
you
that
we
made
more--
mr.
william
l.
summers
--pardon
me,
sir.
mr.
william
l.
summers
who
knows
what
is
true?
0
[generallaughter.]
first
of
all,
mr.
justice,
if
it
please
you,
they
have
the
sole
and
exclusive
right
to
decide
how
many
lieutenants,
how
many
captains,
and
how
many
battalion
chiefs.
in
the
order
it
says
that
manning
and
staffing
shall
never
be
considered
in
this
affirmative
action
plan,
so
they
can
make
as
many
jobs
as
they
want.
but
in
the
footnote
to
our
reply
brief,
i
would
ask
that
you
look
at
it,
page
17.
in
1976,
there
were
26
percent
of
the
fire
force
were
in
the
officer,
promoted
officer
ranks.
in
1986,
there
is
26
percent
promoted
rank
membership
on
that
fire
service.
now,
the
old
saying
about
figures
can
lie
and
liars
can
figure,
there
is
the
same
percentage
of
individuals
in
the
promoted
ranks
in
the
fire
service
in
the
city
of
cleveland
this
year
than
there
was
ten
years
ago,
so
where's
all
these
new
jobs?
those
jobs
that
they
are
talking
about,
and
i
have
added
one
page
to
my
reply
brief,
was
because
there
is
some
illusion
here
that
maybe
some
litigation,
and
maybe
even
it
was
affirmative
action
litigation,
kept
promotions
from
happening.
not
true.
and
testimony
produced
by
the
plaintiff
in
this
matter
shows
that
that
wasn't
true.
there
was
a
bad,
mechanically
bad
test
given.
that
was
contested
in
state
courts
and
held
up
the
promotions
because
the
city
didn't
give
promotions
between
1972
and
1975,
and
then
again
between
'75
and
'81,
even
though
the
law
says
that
every
two
years
upon
the
expiration
of
a
list
they
should
do
so.
now,
when
they
assert
to
this
court
that,
well,
we
made
more
jobs
and
therefore
what
was
the
wrong,
the
wrong
is,
in
every
single
individual,
minority
or
non-minority,
if
his
job
is
taken
away
from
him
by
the
operation
of
706(g)
interpreting
a
court
order
to
say,
you
won
it,
you
won
it
fair
and
square,
but
you
are
not
going
to
get
it,
that
is
not
what
706(g)
meant
to
say.
and,
mr.
justice
brennan,
you
questioned
the
meaning
and
the
intent
of
representative
seller.
in
the
government's
brief
on
page
9,
he
is
quoted
there
that
he
expressly
responded
to
the
charge
that
federal
courts
and
agencies
would
order
quotas
and
other
forms
of
preferential
treatment
under
title
7.
noting
that
a
court
order
could
be
entered
only
on
proof,
he
was
quoted
as
saying
that
the
particular
employer
involved
had
in
fact
discriminated
against
one
or
more
of
his
employees
because
of
race.
representative
seller
emphasized
even
then
the
court
could
not
order
that
any
preference
be
given
to
any
particular
race,
but
we
would
be
limited
to
ordering
an
end
to
discrimination.
the
citation
to
the
congressional
record
is
there.
folks,
i
started
off
by
saying
this
is
a
question
of
statutory
construction.
does
that
statute
provide
for
make
whole
relief
in
the
forms
of
quotas?
we
honestly
believe
it
does
not.
it
is
congress's
job.
congress
should
not
put
that
job
before
this
court.
in
construing
that
statute,
we
believe
it
is
clear,
we
believe
the
stotts
opinion
is
clear,
and
we
ask
your
indulgence
to
rule
in
that
manner.
thank
you
very
much.
