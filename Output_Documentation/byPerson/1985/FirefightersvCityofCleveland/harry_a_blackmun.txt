you
answer
my
question.

done
what
you
wanted
the
union
to
be
able
to
do?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
even
if
he
had
intervened.
justice
harry
a.

are
you
still
quoting
senator
humphrey?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
can't
help
but
ask
the
question,
if
he
were
here
today,
on
which
side
of
this
case
do
you
think
he
would
stand?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think

stipulated
to
that
effect.
