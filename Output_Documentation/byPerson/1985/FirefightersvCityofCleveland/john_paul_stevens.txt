paul

i
must
confess,
i
don't
understand
it.
it
seems
to
me
either
the
statute
is
an
obstacle
or
it
isn't,
and
i
don't
know
why
the
union's
agreement
makes
any
difference
to
the
minority
or
the
absence
of
the
union
agreement
makes
any
difference
if
the
statute
is
not
violated.
i
don't
understand
your
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
would
be
true
if
you
agreed
to
it,
and
if
it
is
proper
the
fact
you
didn't
agree
to
it
doesn't
make
it
improper.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
reynolds,
can
i
ask
you
another
question
about
the
text
of
the
last
sentence
of
706(g)?
it
refers
to
no
relief
for
a
particular
individual,
and
then
it
defines
the
kind
of
individual
for
which
the
relief
shall
not
be
given
as
"if
such
individual"...
the
"such"
refers
back...
"was
refused
admission",
and
so
forth,
"for
any
reason
other
than
discrimination
on
account
of
race.
"
is
it
your
contention
that
the
black
officers
who
were
promoted
here
had
been
refused
advancement
for
some
other
reason
within
the
meaning
of
that
section?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
that
were
true,
if
they
had
been
denied
promotion
because
of
lack
of
qualification,
you
would
say
the
language
reads
directly
on
them.
my
question
really
is,
does
this
language
read
on
other
"nonvictims"
unless
they
meet
that
test?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
do
not
really
contend
that
it
is
a
plain
language
case,
but
rather
it
is
an
ambiguity
case,
and
we
must
then
look
at
the
legislative
history.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
agree
that
the
black
officers
who
get
the
benefit
of
this
decree
are
non-victims?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
he
did
in
part.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
did
in
part,
and
i
would
like
to
hear
your
answer.
he
said
they
created
more
jobs,
which
obviously
would
have
increased
the
budgetary
responsibility
of
the
city,
which
made
more
jobs
available
to
your
client.
so
is
that
true
or
not?
