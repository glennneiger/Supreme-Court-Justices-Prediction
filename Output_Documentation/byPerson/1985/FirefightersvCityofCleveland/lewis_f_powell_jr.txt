mr.
reynolds,
would
you
describe
exactly
the
effect
of
the
consent
decree
on
the
promotion
of
people
who
already
were
in
the
union?
what
effect
did
it
have
on
the
promotion
of
union
members
who
were
white?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
did
it
apply
to
promotion
of
blacks
who
did
not
possess
the
requisite
qualifications
for
promotion
by
whites?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
there
were
specified
numbers
of
promotions
that
were
to
be
made
to
each
office,
weren't
there?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
those
goals
or
quotas
had
to
be
met
even
if
there
were
better
qualified
whites
at
the
time?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
does
the
record
show
that?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
mentioned
examinations.
would
the
grades
made
by
the
applicants
be
taken
into
account
in
determining
who
would
be
promoted?
would
the
grades
made
on
the
examinations?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes,
but
assuming
that
ten
people
passed,
and
some
were
much
higher
in
grade
scores
than
others,
and
only
five
positions
were
to
be
filled,
would
they
be
filled
in
accordance
with
the
grade
scores
or
not?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
how
far
is
that?
