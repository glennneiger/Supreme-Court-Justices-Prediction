justice
william
h.
rehnquist
all
right.
well,
go
ahead.
are
you
saying
they
would
be
bound
so
that
none
of
them
could
bring
an
individual
action
if
they
claimed
there
was
a
violation
of
either
title
7
or
of
the
constitution?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
that
is
probably
a
pretty
good
answer.
interesting.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
ordinarily
if
the
city
created
more
promotions,
as
you
refer
to
them,
they
would
have
gone
to
people
next
in
line,
would
they
not
have?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
district
court
make
any
finding
as
to
past
discrimination
on
the
part
of
the
city
of
cleveland
in
making
the
decree?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
this
case
in
any
different
posture
than
if
the
city
of
cleveland
had
voluntarily
decided,
i
think
we
will
go
ahead
and
do
this
because
of
our
past
employment
practices?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
weber
decision
did
not
apply
to
a
public
body.
that
was
a
private
firm.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
the
weber
decision
is
controlling.
and
i
am
saying
to
you,
one
thing
that
strikes
me
is
different
is
the
fact
that
the
weber
decision
involved
kaiser
aetna,
which
is
a
private
firm.
this
case
involves
the
city
of
cleveland,
which
is
bound
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
city
of
cleveland
could
just
as
a
matter
of
course
decide
that
we
are
going
to
hire
60
percent
blacks
and
40
percent
whites
because
of,
say,
the
political
situation
in
the
city
of
cleveland?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
congress
can't
have
the
final
say
on
what
an
employer
can
do
as
to
voluntary
compliance
when
you
are
talking
about
a
public
body.
