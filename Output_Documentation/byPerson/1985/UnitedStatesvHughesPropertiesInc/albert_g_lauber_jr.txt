mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
proper
time
for
claiming
deductions
by
taxpayers
that
use
the
accrual
basis
of
accounting.
under
this
court's
decision,
the
proper
time
for
accruing
tax
deductions
is
governed
by
the
1926.
as
the
court
noted
50
years
ago,
in
brown
versus
helvering
and
more
recently
in
thor
power
tool
company
in
1979,
the
all
events
test
helps
to
serve
the
objectives
of
tax
accounting.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
that's
all
it
began
its
life
as,
but
it
has
since
taken
on
a
kind
of
talismanic
quality
in
tax
jurisprudence.
it's
one
of
the
great
traditional
tests
that
has
come
down
to
us
through
the
years.
and,
the
meaning
of
the
test
is
what
governs
the
time
of
taking
accrued
deductions
by
taxpayers,
previous
accrual,
accrual
basis.
i
don't
think
justice
stone
intended
it
to
have
that
quality,
but
it
has
been
seized
upon
and
elaborated
by
the
court
itself
in
later
years.
and
the
way
the
all
events
test
helps
to
serve
the
objectives
of
tax
accounting
is
to
protect
the
fisc
and
to
help
achieve
equality
of
treatment
for
taxpayers
by
insisting
upon
a
high
degree
of
certainty
before
deductions
are
permitted
for
tax
purposes.
the
all
events
test
has
two
elements.
it
requires
that
an
item
of
expense
be
taken
as
a
tax
deduction,
be
accrued
for
the
taxable
year
in
which
all
the
events
have
occurred
that
create
on
the
part
of
the
taxpayer
a
fixed
and
unconditional
obligation
to
pay
the
expense,
and
secondly,
which
permit
the
amount
of
that
payment
to
be
determined
with
reasonable
accuracy.
this
case
involves
the
proper
application
of
the
first
component
of
the
test,
that
is,
the
requirement
that
the
taxpayer
have
at
the
end
of
the
year
a
fixed
obligation
to
make
a
payment.
the
taxpayer
here
is
a
nevada
gambling
casino
that
operates,
on
the
casino
floor,
gambling
devices
called
progressive
slot
machines.
a
progressive
slot
machine
is
like
an
ordinary
slot
machine
except
that
it
has,
besides
its
usual
jackpot,
an
additional
progressive
jackpot
whose
amount
is
shown
on
a
little
meter
on
the
face
of
the
machine,
and
every
time
somebody
plays
the
machine
and
loses,
the
meter
goes
up
and
it
keeps
on
going
up
until
somebody
actually
wins
the
jackpot.
in
order
to
win
a
jackpot
the
player
must
gamble
the
required
amount
of
money,
which
is
the
case
of
a
multiple
coin
machine
is
the
maximum
amount
that
can
be
gambled.
and,
he
must
pull
the
handle
and
come
up
with
the
winning
combination
of
symbols.
the
odds
of
winning
a
progressive
jackpot
are
determined
by
the
casino.
by
adjusting
the
number
of
wheels
on
the
machine,
the
number
of
symbols
on
each
wheel,
the
number
of
winning
symbols,
the
casino
can
determine
the
odds
of
winning
the
jackpot,
and
based
on
the
expected
frequency
of
the
machine's
play,
it
can
predict
a
projected
payoff
date
of
any
particular
progressive
jackpot.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
my
understanding
is
that
the
regular
jackpots
tend
to
be
in
smaller
amounts
and
are
won
much
more
frequently,
and
i
don't
believe
the
nevada
gaming
commission
regulates
regular
jackpots,
only
progressive
jackpots.
so,
respondents
don't
have
the
argument
available
to
them
here,
that
the
commission's
regulations
give
them
a
fixed
liability--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--i
couldn't
be
sure
of
that.
the
projected
payoff
date
for
these
jackpots
can
range
from
several
months
down
the
road
to
several
years
down
the
road.
the
money
corresponding
to
the
jackpots
does
not
sit
physically
in
the
machine.
the
casinos
typically
collect
the
coins
out
of
the
machine
a
couple
of
times
a
week.
they
are
free
to
use
that
money
and
to
earn
income
upon
it,
as
they
see
fit,
until
a
jackpot
is
actually
won.
when
a
jackpot
is
won,
the
winner
typically
will
go
and
seek
payment
from
the
cashier's
cage
at
the
casino.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
i
have
read
the
record.
i
can't
claim
this
is
firsthand
knowledge,
but
this
is
what
is
told
to
me
by
the
record.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
oh,
did
they
come
back
and--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--now
you
know
who--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--but
it
doesn't
actually
come
out
of
the
machine.
it
comes
over
from
a
human
being.
there
is
no
dispute
here
that
progressive
jackpots
intrinsically
are
the
kind
of
expense
that
qualify
for
deduction
as
a
proper
expense
of
running
a
gambling
business.
the
only
question
here
concerns
the
proper
time
for
taking
the
deduction.
and
the
question
is
really
one
of
timing.
it
is
an
important
question
because
of
the
time
value
of
money,
both
from
government
and
the
taxpayers'
point
of
view.
we
contend
that
the
proper
year
for
conducting
a
progressive
jackpot
is
a
year
in
which
the
jackpot
is
actually
won
by
the
customer.
respondent
argues
that
the
actual
winning
of
the
jackpot
is
irrelevant,
and
that
its
liability
for
the
jackpots
becomes
established
the
minute
the
machine
is
placed
on
the
gambling
floor
to
begin
with.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
there
is
a
lot
to
say
about
that.
the
revenue
code
treats
insurance
companies
in
a
unique
manner.
there's
a
whole
subchapter
of
the
code,
subchapter
l,
that
just
governs
insurance
companies,
and
congress
allows
insurance
companies
alone
of
all
taxpayers
to
claim
current
deductions
for
additions
to
reserves
they
establish
to
pay
off
life
insurance
and
disability
claims.
so,
they
are
allowed
to
deduct
these
reserves
anticipatorily
through
a
particular
congressional
statute
that
covers
just
insurance
companies.
ordinary
taxpayers
may
equally
be
motivated
to
establish
reserves
on
their
books,
but
they
can't
deduct
them
because
they're
not
allowed
to
by
the
revenue
code.
there
are
some
reserves,
like
bad
debt
reserves,
that
congress
has
authorized,
but
generally
speaking
reserves
are
reserved
for
life
insurance
companies
and
casualty
insurance
companies.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
that
could
depend
on
how
the
decision
was
written.
this
is
an
issue,
as
i
mentioned
to
justice
rehnquist,
that's
been
around
for
a
great
number
of
years
and
there
have
been
an
awful
lot
of
court
of
appeals
cases
that
have
construed
the
all
events
test
as
applied
to
accruals
for
workmen's
compensation
liabilities,
tort
claims,
all
kinds
of
things.
and
the
principle
of
what
your
need
to
have
in
fixed
obligations
to
make
a
payment
is
very
important
in
the
tax
law
generally,
and
all
these
other
obligations
could
be
affected
by
it.
now,
congress
has
amended
the
tax
laws
in
1984
to
take
care
of
some
of
those
problems,
workmen's
compensation
and
the
like,
but
generally
speaking
the
old
events
test
remains
the
basic
judicial
test
that
congress
has
modified
in
some
ways
the
years
after
'84.
so,
the
court's
decision
would
affect
virtually
all
deductions
claimed
by
accrual
basis
taxpayers.
respondents'
argument
is
that
they
should
be
allowed
to
accrue
as
a
deduction
for
any
year
the
net
increase
in
the
amounts
shown
on
those
jackpot
meters
for
the
year,
as
of
midnight
on
the
last
day
of
their
tax
year.
that
argument
is
based
on
the
theory
that
it's
very
likely
that
somebody
will
eventually
win
the
jackpot
due
to
the
laws
of
averages,
and
that
when
somebody
does
win
the
jackpot
the
amount
they
win
will
be
at
least
as
big
as
the
amount
on
the
year-end
meter
because
nevada
regulations
prohibit
casinos
from
turning
these
meters
back
down
to
a
lesser
amount.
in
analyzing
this
case
we
start
from
the
premise
that
the
type
of
liability
presupposed
by
the
all
events
test
is
not
some
kind
of
inchoate
or
abstract
liability,
but
the
obligation
to
make
a
payment.
this
is
what
distinguishes
the
accrual
method
of
accounting
from
the
cash
method.
under
the
cash
method
an
item
is
deductible
when
the
taxpayer
actually
says
the
expense.
under
the
accrual
method,
it
is
deductible
when
he
incurs
the
obligation.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
we
agree
with
that.
in
fact
the
accountants
for
the
respondent
required
that
a
reserve
be
set
up
for
these
contingent
liabilities
at
the
end
of
the
year,
and
they
found
that
was
consistent
with
generally
accepted
accounting
principles,
but
this
court
has
often
held,
most
recently
in
thor
power
tool
company,
and
earlier
in
triple-a,
that
the
fact
that
a
deduction,
an
accrual
is
proper
for
financial
accounting
purposes,
is
not
dispositive
for
tax
purposes
because
of
very
different
objectives
that
the
two
accounting
systems
have.
in
this
case
we
think
it
is
clear
that
respondent
at
the
close
of
its
tax
year
had
incurred
no
obligation
to
pay
the
progressive
jackpots
to
anyone.
indeed,
there
is
no
one
in
the
world
who
could
at
that
moment
assert
any
possible
claim
to
those
funds.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
i
would
agree
with
the
premise
that
the
ultimate
identity
of
the
payee
is
not
important.
but
we
think
what
precludes
the
deduction
here
is
that
nobody
has
won
the
jackpot.
it's
not
that
someone
has
won
and
we
don't
know
who.
we--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--there
is
a
probability
that
every
time
somebody
pulls
the
machine
programmed
to
pay
off
at
one
in
10,000,
he
has
a
one
in
10,000
chance
of
winning.
that
is
true
indefinitely
into
the
future.
all
we
have
here
is
a
probability--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
i
would
agree
it
is
quite
similar
in
economic
terms,
but
from
a
tax
point
of
view
they're
very
different
because
congress
has
authorized
insurance
companies
to
set
up
these
reserves
for
very
sound
reasons.
congress
has
not
authorized
taxpayers
to
set
up
their
own
reserves
for
contingent
liabilities
based
on
mere
probability
of
occurrence
of
these
future
events.
and
that
principle
goes
back
to
justice
brandeis's
opinion
in
brown
v.
helvering
where
the
taxpayer
was
an
insurance
commission
agent
and
he
received
insurance
commissions.
and,
he
showed
to
the
court
there
was
a
great
probability
that
he
would
have
to
refund
large
portions
of
those
premiums
in
later
years
because
of
cancellations
of
the
policies.
he
showed
that
policies
were
always
cancelled,
every
year.
the
court
denied
deduction
for
that
reserve,
pointing
out
the
tax
law
requires
not
probabilities
but
certainties.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
think
it
wouldn't
really
matter
if
the
probability
were
based
on
the
laws
of
averages,
and
the
odds
of
winning,
on
past
experience.
in
either
event
our
position
would
be
that
a
mere
projection
that
he
likely
will
incur
a
liability
is
not
sufficient
to
justify
tax
deduction.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
it
certainly
would
happen
within
the
next
succeeding
year?
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
we
would
take
the
same
position,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
think,
justice
marshall,
that
although
the
rules
of
the
commission,
gaming
commission,
don't
speak
to
this,
there
is
a
policy
that
they
can't
just
retire
a
machine
from
service
willy-nilly.
the
have
to
transfer--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--then
they're
off
the
hook,
if
it
is
stipulated--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
if
they
had
deducted
that
amount
in
the
year
one,
when
they
shut
the
casino
down
they
might
have
to
recognize
income
under
the
tax
benefit
rule
when
they
got
relieved
of
the
obligation.
but
you're
right,
you're
absolutely
right
that
they
would
be
relieved
of
the
obligation,
and
if
they
went
into
bankruptcy,
that
they've
stopped
being
a
gambling
casino,
people
have
stopped
playing
the
slot
machines,
they
would
be
off
the
hook.
and
that--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--that
isn't
our
position.
our
position
is,
what
precludes
a
deduction
is
not
the
fact
that
they
have
a
liability
now,
which
might
be...
they
might
be
divested
of
if
they
go
out
into
bankruptcy
or
go
out
of
business,
or
lose
their
license.
our
position
is,
they
can't
deduct
it
because
they
have
no
present
liability
to
make
a
payment.
it's
not
that
they
have
a
liability
that
they
might
get
out
of.
their
obligation
is
to
pay
a
jackpot,
and
they
have
no
obligation
to
pay
a
jackpot
until
somebody
wins
the
jackpot.
so,
it's
the
fact
that
nobody...
at
the
end
of
the
year
nobody
could
claim
those
jackpot
funds.
they
have
not
parted
with
anything.
and
we
think
that
all
the
nevada
regulatory
scheme
requires
is
that,
in
a
casino,
keep
the
machines
in
play
indefinitely
without
reducing
the
meter
so
that
future
patrons
will
have
the
opportunity
to
win
a
jackpot.
but,
the
commission's
regulations
don't
require
them
to
pay
a
jackpot
until
somebody
wins
the
jackpot.
it
is
that
winning
of
the
jackpot
which
creates
the
liability
to
make
a
payment.
until
then,
all
the
casino
has
is
an
inchoate
obligation
to
keep
the
machines
in
play
on
the
floor,
pending
people's
future
play
and
possible
future
winning
of
the
jackpot.
but,
that
obligation
keeps--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--that's
right.
that
would
be
another
contingency
that
could
relieve
them.
but
we're
not
relying
on
that
mere
possibility
of
going
bankrupt.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
don't
think
so,
and
that's
a
very
good
point.
that's
right.
our
position
is
not
that
they
might
go
bankrupt,
but
if
they
did
go
bankrupt
no
one
could
even
come
into
bankruptcy
court
and
assert
a
claim
for
these
items.
the
items
would
not
escheat
to
the
state.
they
would
go
right
back
to
the
casino,
the
part
of
the
bankruptcy
estate.
they
would
not
go
to
the
state
of
nevada.
and
we
think
that's
right.
since
no
one
can
make
a
claim
for
these
funds
in
any
tribunal
at
the
end
of
the
year,
that
shows
there
is
no
present
obligation.
to
put
it
simply,
we
think
an
obligation
presupposes
an
obligor
and
an
obligee.
but,
there
is
no
obligee
at
the
end
of
the
year.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
it
would
be.
that's
right.
that's
another
way
of
phrasing
the
issue,
but
you
get
into
trouble
because
you
don't
want
to
argue
that
the
possibility
of
going
out
of
business
prevents
an
accrual,
because
then
no
one
could
ever
accrue
anything.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
right.
and
we
think,
in
fact,
that
the
going
out
of
business
example
is
kind
of
evidentiary,
that
there
is
no
year
and
liability,
because
if
it
did
go
out
of
business
they
would
be
off
the
hook.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
they
could
go
bankrupt
and
they
can
lose
their
license.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
don't
think
they
go
bankrupt,
but
they
do
lose
their
licenses
sometimes
because--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--but
the
point
about
the
commission's
regulations,
the
regulatory
scheme
respondent
relies
on,
is
that
they
don't
require
a
jackpot
to
be
paid
until
the
jackpot
is
won.
here
is
might
be
useful
to
compare
what
life
was
like
in
casinos
before
1972
when
this
rule
about
not
turning
meters
back
was
promulgated.
before
that
time,
respondents
seemed
to
agree
that
they
had
merely
a
contingent
liability
that
they
could
not
deduct
for
tax
purposes.
they
are
resting
their
case
entirely
on
the
'72
rule
saying
they
can't
turn
the
meters
back.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
but
in
our
view,
that
rule
saying
you
can't
turn
the
meters
back
doesn't
have
any
effect
at
all
on
the
contingent
nature
of
that
liability.
the
liability
remains
before
and
after
that
rule
was
issued
in
'72
to
pay
a
jackpot
if
and
only
if
the
jackpot
is
won.
all
that
rule
about,
turn
the
meters
back,
goes
to...
is
the
amount
of
the
liability.
it
enables
the
casino
to
estimate
the
minimum
amount
of
its
contingent
liability
because
it
knows
it
can't
turn
the
meter
back
from
the
amount
shown
at
midnight
on
the
last
day
of
the
tax
year.
which
means,
if
it
ever
does
incur
the
liability,
it
will
be
in
at
least
that
minimum
amount.
that
rule
does
not
affect
the
contingent
nature
of
the
pre-existing
obligation
the
casino
had
to
pay
the
jackpot
if
and
only
if
somebody
wins.
we
think
a
good
way
of
analyzing
these
progressive
jackpots
is
that
they
are
prizes
offered
to
the
public
to
induce
people
to
gamble
on
the
slot
machines.
the
gaming
commission's
rules
basically
require
the
casino
to
keep
that
offer
open
indefinitely.
it
required
that
it
make
an
irrevocable
offer
of
a
prize.
but,
they
don't
require
the
casino
to
actually
pay
the
prize
until
somebody
wins
it,
so
while
the
casino
has
an
irrevocable
offer,
that
offer
is
still...
its
liability
on
the
offer
is
still
contingent
until
some
lucky
patron
in
effect
accepts
the
offer
by
satisfying
the
preconditions
for
payment,
which
is
to
gamble
a
required
amount
of
money
and
to
come
up
with
the
winning
combination
of
symbols
on
the
slot
machine.
it
has
to
be
both
the
offer
and
the
acceptance
of
the
offer
before
you
have
an
obligation
to
make
a
payment,
and
that's
what
the
tax
law
requires.
we
think
it
would
be
quite
a
different
case
if
the
nevada
gaming
authorities
required
a
casino
to
pay
an
amount
corresponding
to
the
year-end
jackpot
totals
to
an
escrow
agent,
or
to
a
trustee,
to
be
held
for
the
benefit
of
future
jackpot
winners.
in
that
event
it
would
be
an
obligation
to
make
a
payment
to
an
independent
party
who
would
hold
the
money
for
the
beneficiaries,
ultimate
winners
of
the
jackpots,
with
the
money
never
being
able
to
revert
back
to
the
casino.
it
would
also
be
very
different
if
respondent,
to
insure
its
obligations
on
the
jackpots,
were
to
pay...
take
out
insurance
policies
covering
its
contingent
liability
on
the
jackpots
and
paid
a
premium
to
an
insurance
company.
they
could
deduct
that
premium.
if
they
took
out
a
bond
to
cover
their
obligation,
they
could
deduct
their
bonding
fee
paid
to
the
third
party.
what
they
can't
deduct
is
a
reserve
they
set
up
on
their
own
books.
they
still
have
the
money,
still
earn
income
on
the
money,
on
the
mere
theory
they
may
ultimately
have
to
pay
that
money
to
somebody
else.
they
haven't
externalized
their
obligation.
they've
kept
it
completely
within-house.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
think
that
was
the
anderson
case.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
that's--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
what
the
anderson
court
held
is
that...
there
was
a
munitions
tax
which
was
payable
on
the
manufacturing
and
sale
of
munitions
during
the
year.
and
what
the
court
held
there
was
because
the
manufacturer
had
by
definition
finished
manufacturing
and
selling
munitions
for
the
year,
a
midnight
on
the
last
day
of
the
year,
all
the
events
required
to
give
it
an
obligation
to
pay
the
tax
had
arisen
by
the
end
of
the
year.
the
mere
fact
the
tax
was
actually
paid
in
april
the
following
year,
the
court
held
was
not
relevant.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
that's
absolutely
right.
under
the
cash
basis
the
actual
transfer
of
money
is
the
crucial
thing,
you
have
to
actually
make
payment.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
but
they
must
have
incurred
an
obligation
to
pay
the
money
to
somebody
else.
that
is
the
key
thing.
but
what
must...
all
of
the
events
must
have
occurred
to
give
you
an
obligation
to
make
the
payment.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
because
there
it
would
be
an
obligation
to
make
a
payment
to
an
escrow
agent
or
to
a
trustee
who
would
hold
the
money,
never
come
back
to
you,
is
gone
irrevocably,
to
hold
the
money
and
distribute
it
to
the
ultimate
jackpot
winners
years
down
the
road.
that
would
be
an
externalization,
would
have
incurred
the
obligation
to
pay
that
money
to
an
independent
third
party.
that,
we
think,
is
the
kay
thing
that
you
have
to
have
for
an
accrual
for
tax
purposes.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
if
the
taxpayer
had
signed
a
contract
obligating
himself--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--it
would
be
proper
to
accrue
the
liability,
and
if
you
vanished
and
he
never
had
to
say
it,
he
would
then
have
income
in
later
years.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
no,
it
would
be
in
the
year
it
happened.
for
example,
if
somebody
performed
work
for
you
and
you
agreed
to
pay
that,
the
painter
or
the
plumber,
and
you
didn't
pay
them
during
the
year
but
you
are
obligated
to
them,
you
are
an
accrual
basis
taxpayer.
even
if
the
plumber
vanished
and
never
got
paid,
you
would
get
a
deduction
for
a
proper
accrual
in
the
year
you
incurred
the
obligation
to
pay
him.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
the
year
in
which
you
incurred
the
obligation
to
pay--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--we
think
it
has
not,
because
the
obligation
issue
is
the
obligation
to
make
a
payment
of
a
jackpot
and
nobody
has
any
claim
to
a
jackpot
until
they
win
it.
i
mean,
your
example,
justice
powell,
the
painter
paints
your
house,
he
has
a
claim
to
payment
because
he
painted
your
house.
here,
no
one
has
any
claim
to
this
money
until
they
win
the
jackpot.
that's
the
crucial
difference.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
it
owes
the
money
to
somebody
who
succeeds
in
winning
the
jackpot.
if
people
stop
playing
the
machines
the
next
day,
it
doesn't
owe
a
penny
to
anyone.
what
if
people
just
gave
up
gambling,
some
kind
of
new
amendment
that
made
gambling
unconstitutional,
they'd
never
owe
the
money
to
anyone.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
that
is
what
is
a
normal
rule
for
financial
accounting.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
where
we
benefit
is
that
the
deduction
that
they
wish
to
have
is
deferred
until
they
pay
the
jackpot,
maybe
three
or
four
years
away,
and
because
the
deduction
today
is
worth
more
for
the
tax
period
than
a
deduction
five
years
from
now.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
exactly
right.
that's
always
the
issue
in
all
events
tax
cases,
because...
which
is
always
a
proper
time
for
taking
deductions.
so,
all
these
cases
always
involve
the
time
value
of
money.
taxpayers
want
to
get
deductions
in
year
one,
we
want
them
to
have
deductions
in
year
ten.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
i
missed
that
question.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
it
would
have--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--i
think
with
the...
it
could
have
a
loss
that
year
which
you
could
then
carry
back
ten
years
and
carry
forward.
you
must
remember
that
casinos
have
dozens
and
dozens
of
these
machines
on
the
floor
and
they
all
tend...
some
are
paying
off
this
year,
some
are
paying
off
next
year,
and
they
result
in
a
fairly
constant
flow
of
income
and
expense
to
the
casino.
it's
not
like
they
have
a
cataclysmic
event
in
one
year
that
destroys
them.
there
are
always
other
machines
that
are
not
paying
off
at
that
time.
so,
the
likelihood
of
a
casino
having
to
pay
a
jackpot
and
not
being
able
to
get
a
tax
benefit
from
it
is
extremely
unlikely,
because
they
can
carry
forward
and
back
their
tax
losses.
we
think
that
what
respondent's
position
boils
down
to
is
the
argument
that
they
have
a
probability
of
incurring
a
liability
in
the
future
to
day
these
jackpots.
that
should
be
sufficient
to
justify
a
deduction
for
tax
purposes.
but
this
court
has
rejected
that
argument
repeatedly
over
a
50-year
period.
brown
versus
helvering,
as
i
mentioned
before,
the
taxpayer
argued
there
was
a
probability
it
would
have
to
make
refunds
of
a
certain
portion
of
the
insurance
premiums,
but
the
court
rejected
that
argument.
