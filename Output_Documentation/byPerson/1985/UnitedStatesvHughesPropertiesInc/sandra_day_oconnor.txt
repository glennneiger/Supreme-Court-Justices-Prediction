mr.
lauber,
how
does
the
internal
revenue
service
treat
funds
that
are
set
aside
by
insurance
companies
out
of
premiums
to
pay
off
potential
expected
claims,
and
is
there
some
correlation
between
the
rules
for
that
and
the
rules
applicable
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
any
other
broad
category
of
business
deductions
that
would
potentially
be
affected
by
a
decision
here
on
the
application
of
the
all
events
test?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
should
the
identity
of
the
eventual
payee
matter,
as
long
as
it's
certain
there
will
be
a
payee?
what
difference
does
it
make
that
you
don't
know
specifically
who,
as
long
as
you
know
someone
will
be
getting
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
but
you
know
that
someone
will,
under
the
nevada
gaming
regulations--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
congress
has
made
the
very
same
kind
of
a
determination
in
its
treatment
for
insurance
reserves.
there's
a
probability
that
we'll
all
die
someday
and
they're
going
to
let
you
set
aside
a
certain
portion
of
the
premium.
now,
why
isn't
this
essentially
equivalent
to
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
lauber,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
possibility
that
a
corporation
or
a
business
will
go
out
of
business
or
go
bankrupt
or
have
a
disaster
is
always
present
for
any
accrual
based
taxpayer,
and
that
shouldn't
defeat
the
accrual
deduction.
it
just
strikes
me
as
very
extreme
position
to
argue.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
as
i
understand
it,
they
don't
even
have
that
obligation
because
they
could
decide
to
go
out
of
business.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
for
accrual
taxpayers,
it
surely
doesn't
make
any
difference
that
the
taxpayer
has
the
use
of
the
money
in
the
meantime?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
lilienstern,
as
i
understand
it
the
internal
revenue
service
has
regulatory
authority
to
determine
whether
the
accrual
of
counting
system
is
properly
reflecting
income.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
does
that
authority
fit
into
this
question?
