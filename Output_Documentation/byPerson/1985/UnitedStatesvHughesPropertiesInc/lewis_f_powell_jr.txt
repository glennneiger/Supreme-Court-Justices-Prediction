f.
powell,

may
i
just
ask
a
rather
simplistic
question,
and
probably
never
get
a
simplistic
answer.
let's
assume
a
taxpayer
who
agreed
at
the
end
of
the
year
that
it
owed
me
$1,000,
and
then
assume
further,
i
just
disappeared
somewhere
and
he
never
had
a
chance
to
pay
me.
would
that
liability
have
accrued?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
let's
say
it's
a
contract
obligation.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
would
be
the
tax
consequences?
would
the
taxes
be
paid
on
the
basis
of
the
year
in
which
that
liability
accrued,
or
would
it
be
paid
in
some
future
speculative
year
on
the
assumption
that
maybe
i'd
disappeared
for--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--where
would
i
get
the
deduction?
when
would
the
taxpayer
get
the
deduction?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
is
there
any
question
about
the
fact
that
the
obligation
on
accrued
by
the
end
of
the
year,
in
this
case?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
so
far
as
the
casino
is
concerned,
it
owes
that
money
to
whoever
identifies
himself
or
herself
at
some
later
date.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--i
sort
of
like
my
example
of
disappearing.
normally,
of
course,
you
take
a
deduction
the
same
year
you
have
the
income,
in
other
words,
you
charge
your
expenses
against
the
income.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
how
does
the
government
benefit
from
your
position?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so,
the
government
gets
the
use
of
the
money
until--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--but
if
in
a
future
year
the
taxpayer
has
no
money,
it
loses
the
benefit
of
the
liability?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
some
year
an
individual
will
come
along
and
pull
a
jackpot.
then
that
year
happened
to
be
a
year
in
which
the
casino
lost
money.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
wouldn't
have
any
income
to
charge
it
off
against.
