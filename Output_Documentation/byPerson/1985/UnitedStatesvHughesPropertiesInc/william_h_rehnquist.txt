justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
lauber,
you
refer
to
the
court
enunciating
a
principle,
and
it
was
just
a
sentence
in
justice
stone's
opinion,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing,
mr.
lauber,
that
in
this
case
it
was
demonstrated
beyond
peradventure,
so
to
speak,
on
the
basis
of
past
performance
how
many
people
come
in,
what
the
machines
are
set
for,
but
there
was
going
to
be
a
payoff,
a
certain
number
of
payoffs
on
this
jackpot
within
a
given
year.
would
your
case
be
much
different?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
just
hypothetically
that
the
government,
surely
mistakenly
in
your
view,
had
stipulated
in
the
trial
court
that
it
was
certain
that
this
thing
would
happen
within
the
year.
would
you
feel
that
you
couldn't
argue
the
same
grounds
then
that
you
are
arguing
now?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
that
code
case
though,
that
this
thing
arose
from,
where
the
american
code...
where
the
question
was
the
first
world
war
tax
liability,
now
they
said
you
could
accrue
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
anderson,
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
have
the
anderson
case.
they
said
you
could
accrue
that,
and
these
people
certainly
haven't
transferred
anything
on
their
books,
i
don't
think.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
it
must
be
that
the
transfer
of
money
on
your
books...
or
from
your
books
to
somewhere
else,
is
not
one
of
the
events?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then,
why
could
your
example
about
the
escrow
make
it
all
that
much
different?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
do
we
find
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
know
that
your
case
is
so
much
different
than
brown
on
that
percentage,
because
they
have
a
stipulated
percentage
in
brown
of
23
percent
on
the
basis
of
past
experience.
and,
isn't
that
pretty
much
what
your
probability
is?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it's
an
estimate
as
to
when
you
will
pay
them?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
supposing
it
came
out
that
the
retrospective
calculation
showed
14
months.
certainly,
you
couldn't
deduct
it
in
the
next
year.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
this
thing
had
showed
26
months.
could
you
still
have
deducted
it?
