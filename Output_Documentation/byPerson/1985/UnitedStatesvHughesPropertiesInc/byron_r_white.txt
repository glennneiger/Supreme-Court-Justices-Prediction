suppose
an
accrual
basis
taxpayer
signs
a
promissory
note
that,
in
one
year
that's
payable,
six
months
later
in
another
year.
does
he
accrue
that,
the
first
year?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
at
the
time
the
payment
comes
along
and
he
claims
that
it
was
a
fraud,
and
it's
determined
that
he
never
did
owe
the
money,
he's
relieved
of
his
obligation?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
it
means
is
that
it
is
void
ab
initio,
he
never
had
an
obligation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
i
would
think
in
that
case,
and
according
to
their
argument,
that
you
would
never
be
able
to
accrue
that
liability
because
of
the
possibility
that
it
might
be
a
fraudulent
transaction
and
he
never
had
an
obligation.
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
that
be
their
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
only
the
amount
that's
shown
at
the
end
of
year
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
a
casino
does
lose
its
license
for
some
other
transgression?
what
about
this
supposed
liability?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
what
happens?
justice
byron
r.
white
but...
this
may
never
happen,
but
if
a
casino
just
decided...
a
corporate
entity
owning
a
casino
just
wanted
to
liquidate
and
they
just
decided
to
sell
all
assets
and
liquidate,
what
about
the
machines?
justice
byron
r.
white
say
they
put
the
machines
right
on
the
auction
block
and
they're
bought.
does
anybody
then
assume
the
liability
on
that
machine?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
a
casino
buys
a
bunch
of
slot
machines
and
they
don't
pay
for
them.
they're
going
to...
they
have
an
installment
payment
contract
and
they
default,
and
then
purchaser...
or
the
seller
just
comes
along
and
repossesses
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there's
no...
there's
certainly...
why
should
you
accrue
in
those
situations?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
just--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
the
liability,
as
justice
stevens
pointed
out
to
you,
what's
really
contingent
is
the
liability.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
it's
fixed
because
the
state
law
says
that,
look,
george,
you
must
accrue
this
money
and
pay
it
out
if
and
when
somebody
ever
wins
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
certain
events
happen,
nobody
is
ever
going
to
win
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
affects...
surely
it
affects
both?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
except
that
you...
except
your
statement
shows
that
it
is.
you
say,
pay
your
liabilities.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
everybody
agrees
there
was
a
liability?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
not
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
question
in
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
a
casino
operator
could
say,
"i'm
just
dissatisfied
with
these
newfangled
progressive
slot
machines.
"
"i
just
want
to
get
rid
of
them
and
go
back
to
the
old
style.
"
and
he
goes
to
his
next-door
neighbor,
"would
you
like
to
buy
my
progressive
slot
machines?
"
and
the
fellow
says,
"yes,
i
like
these
devices.
"
and
so
they
just
sell
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
he
wouldn't
be
liable.
he
wouldn't
have
to
pay
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
wouldn't
have
to
pay
the
accrual.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree
with
that,
but
i
can
imagine
that
they'd
want
to
sell
their
slot
machines.
if
they
sold
them
to
an
operator
in
new
jersey,
what
liability
would
remain
if
they
took
