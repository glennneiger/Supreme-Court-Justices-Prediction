mr.
lauber,
can
i
interrupt
you?
does
this
case
just
concern
progressive
jackpots?
why
wouldn't
it
also
concern
regular
jackpots,
if
you
had
a
fixed
amount
that
would
be
payable,
predictably
within--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
regular
jackpots,
they
just
do
that
on
a
cash
basis,
then,
presumably?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
just
one
other
preliminary
question.
would
you
not
agree,
and
i
know
you
would
suggest
it's
not
dispositive,
but
that
sound
accounting
practices
normally,
for
example,
for
disclosure
for
sec
purposes
and
the
like
would
require
setting
up
reserves
for
this
kind
of
contingent
liability?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
not
suggesting...
or
even
bankrupt.
well,
are
there
other
cases
where...
well,
let's
take
the
bankruptcy
for
a
minute,
where
a
business
would
go
bankrupt
and
have...
of
course,
if
it
had
a
liability,
recognized
in
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
and
have
to
be
paid
off,
which
would
not
be
true
here,
that
are
there
situations
where
a
bankruptcy
would...
you
could
satisfy
the
test
even
though
at
the
time
of
bankruptcy
there
would
be
no
liability
at
all,
which
is
what
i
understand
to
be
the
case
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
issue...
and
i
don't
know
that
the
case
is
answered,
is
whether
the
liability
is
unconditional
if
it
can
be
avoided
by
going
out
of
business.
and,
it
would
be
avoided
here
by
going
out
of
business,
as
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
wouldn't
prevent
an
accrual
if
you
had
a
liability?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
suppose
somebody
could
burn
the
place
down.
that's
happened
to
more
than
one
place.
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you
leave
that,
i
want
to
be
sure
i
follow
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
referred
as
to
page
42
which
is
plaintiff's
memorandum
of
contentions
of
fact
and
law,
contentions
of
fact...
this
is
a
government
document,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
that
the
defendant
relies
on
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
the
government's--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
it
says
it's
a
fixed
liability
which
cannot
be
avoided.
that
simply
isn't
correct,
because
if
you
went
out
of
business
it
would
be
avoided.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
stick
to
my
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
went
out
of
business,
say
the
place
burned
down
and
you
totally
terminated
business,
would
the
liability
have
to
be
paid
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
quite
a
different
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
it
is
not
correct
that
there
is
a
fixed
liability
which
cannot
be
avoided.
it
would
be
avoided
by
going
out
of
business.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
may
not
disagree
with
you,
but
you
have
just
acknowledged
to
me
that
it
is
not
correct,
that
this
is
a
fixed
liability
which
cannot
be
avoided,
because
it
would
be
avoided
by
going
out
of
business.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
can
you
give
me
another
example
of
a
proper
accrual
under
the
all
events
test
in
which
the
liability
would
be
avoided
by
going
out
of
business
or
going
into
bankruptcy?
i'm
not
saying,
not
have
to
pay
the
liability,
but
the
existence
of
the
liability
would
he
terminated
by
terminating
the
business.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
went
out
of
business,
to
whom
would
the
liability
be
owed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
whom
would
it
be
owed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
be
owed
to
anyone
at
the
time
you
went
out
of
business?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
say,
in
any
situation.
but
i
asked
you
if
you
could
give
me
a
case
in
which
the
all
events
test
was
satisfied,
even
though
the
taxpayer
could
have
avoided
the
creation
of
the
liability
by
terminating
voluntarily
his
business
entirely,
and
i
haven't
heard
you
cite
a
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
talking
about
satisfying
the
liability.
i'm
talking
about
whether
there
would
be
a
liability
on
the
statement
of
assets
and
liabilities
filed
in
the
bankruptcy
court,
or
whatever
it
might
be.
if
he
burns
down
his
business
voluntarily,
says,
"i
want
to
retire,
i'm
85
years
old,
i
don't
want
to
run
a
gambling
place
any
more.
"
he
burns
down
his
business.
in
that
situation
is
there
any
case...
and
he
has
no
liability
when
he
does
it...
is
there
any
case
you
can
cite
me
which
says
that
the
all
events
test
is
satisfied?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--they
couldn't
sell
them
to
a
casino
in
new
jersey?
