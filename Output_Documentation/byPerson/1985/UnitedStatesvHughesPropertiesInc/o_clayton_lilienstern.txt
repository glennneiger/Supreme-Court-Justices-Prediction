mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
is
one
additional
requirement
which
is
necessary
in
order
for
us
to
accrue
the
deduction
which
we
seek
to
accrue
in
this
case,
and
that
is
that,
quite
apart
from
the
all
events
test,
the
accrual
must
result
in
a
clear
reflection
of
income.
that
relates,
we
believe,
to
some
of
the
questions
that
were,
asked
about
the
period
of
time
between
the
accrual
and
the
payoff.
the
record
of
the
case
indicates
that
that
period
of
time
was
four
and
a
half
months.
we're
saying
this
because
there
are
other
cases,
generally
from
the
lower
courts,
in
which
the
period
of
time
between
the
accrual
and
the
payoff
could
be
perhaps
as
much
as
20
years.
those
cases,
we
suggest,
don't
deal
with
the
notion
of
the
all
events
test,
which
is
what
we
are
talking
about
here
today.
they
deal
with
the
concept
of
the
clear
reflection
of
income.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
well,
one
example,
there's
a
mooney
aircraft
case
in
which
an
aircraft
manufacturer
gave
a
bond
at
the
time
it
sold
a
plane
which
was
to
mature
at
the
time
the
plane
was
retired
from
service.
the
estimate
was
that
the
average
life
of
these
aircraft
would
be
20
to
30
years.
the
court,
in
the
mooney
aircraft
case,
the
fifth
circuit,
held
the
all
events
test
is
satisfied
because
there
is
an
irrevocable
obligation
in
the
year
the
bond
was
given,
but
under
section
446(b)
of
the
code,
there
was
no
clear
reflection
of
income.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
no,
your
honor.
it
is
not
common.
that
is
not
common.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
our
case
here
the
government...
neither
the
government,
nor
have
any
of
the
lower
courts
suggested
that
our
transaction,
the
way
we
accrue
it,
given
the
period
of
time
between
payoffs,
is
other
than
a
clear
reflection
of
income.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
well,
justice
marshall,
for
the
years
in
question
here,
1973
to
1977,
there
was
no
identifiable
fund.
in
1979
the
nevada
gaming
commission
passed
a
regulation
which
required
that
that
he
maintained
in
an
identifiable
form,
in
cash
equivalency.
we
think,
however,
that
that
regulation
doesn't
really
bear
on
the
issue
of
our
liability
here.
we
say
that
under
the
regulation,
and
in
fact
justice
rehnquist
suggested
something
about
a
stipulation
the
court
below...
in
the
claims
court
the
government
stipulated...
this
case
is
here
on
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment.
in
the
claims
court
the
government
stipulated
that
upon
the
adoption
of
nevada
gaming
regulation
5-110,
which
is
the
one
that
is
cited
throughout
our
briefs,
the
liability
became
fixed.
this
is
contained
in
the
joint
appendix.
the
government's
motion
for
summary
judgment
attaches
in
support
the
affidavit
of
its
counsel
in
the
claims
court,
and
the
exhibit
to
that
affidavit.
that
exhibit
was
our
pretrial
submission
in
the
claims
court.
and,
one
contention
of
fact
by
us
which
was
adopted
by
them,
because
all
of
these
facts
were
stipulated,
one
contention
was
that
once
the
increased
jackpot
amount
is
displayed
on
the
machine,
the
increased
jackpot
amount
becomes
a
fixed
liability
which
cannot
be
avoided.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
your
honor,
that
is
at
pages
15
and
16
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
motion
of
the
united
states
for
summary
judgment
on
page
15,
the
affidavit
of
counsel
on
page
16.
then
our
pretrial
submission
is
attached
to
that.
the
actual
language
read
appears
at
page
42
of
the
exhibit.
now,
in
the
courts
below
the
government
took
the
position,
somewhat
like
the
question
concerning
bankruptcy.
they
took
the
position
that,
look,
even
if
you
accrue
this
liability--
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
your
honor,
no.
it
is
our
document
which
was
incorporated
by
reference
in
the
affidavit,
the
only
affidavit
they
had
in
support
of
their
motion
for
summary
judgment
in
the
claims
court.
if
you
look
at
page
15,
the
affidavit
of
counsel
in
the
claims
court
is
there.
it
says
"the
affidavit
of
david
c.
hickman.
"
in
the
exhibit
there
too.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
yes,
your
honor.
i
mean,
there
was
really
no
dispute.
we
were
attempting
to
stipulate
facts,
and
there
seemed
to
be
at
that
time
no
dispute
as
to
this
issue.
in
the
lower
courts
the
government
made
an
assertion
that
it
no
longer--
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
--no...
well,
it
is
a
fixed
liability
as
of
the
time
it's
accrued.
now,
there's
a
body
of
case
law,
as
justice
o'connor
said,
any--
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
the
liability
would
not
have
to
be
paid
but
the
tax
benefit
rule
would
require
that--
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
well,
your
honor,
for
purposes
of
the
all
events
test,
we
say...
in
fact,
the
government...
and
this
court
conceded
in
its
reply
memo
that
contention
of
events
like
that,
remote,
speculative
events
are
not
to
be
considered
in
determining
the
snapshop
issue
of
whether
or
not
there's
a
fixed
liability.
i
don't
believe
they
disagree
with
us
on
that,
your
honor.
i
think
they
would
concede
that.
in
fact,
they
have
conceded--
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
well,
we
put
summary
judgment
evidence
into
the
record,
your
honor,
concerning
the
revenues
of
the
casino.
we
had
affidavits
to
the
effect
that
these
are
ongoing
operations
and
are
not
likely
to
go
out
of
business.
as
the
case
reaches
this
court,
that's
unrefuted.
i
will
concede
that
if
we
want
to
speculate,
these
casinos
or
really
any
other
business
could
theoretically
avoid
liabilities
by
going
out
of
business.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
your
honor,
i'm
not
saying
that
the
existence
of
the
liability
would
be
terminated.
i'm
saying
that
the
requirement
that
it
be
sayable
would
be
terminated.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
if
you
go
out
of
business
the
liability
will
not
he
paid
to
anyone.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
at
the
time
it's
accrued,
it
is
owed
to
a
player.
if
you
go
out
of
business
before
the
jackpot
is
won,
it
will
not
be
said
to
the
player.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
at
the
time
you
went
out
of
business,
no,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
the
regulations,
justice
stevens,
which
we
say
fixes
our
liability,
effectively
precludes
us
from
taking
any
voluntary
action
which
would
result
in
our
failing
to
pay
the
liability
when
it's
accrued.
and
we
say
that
out
of
the
all
events
test,
that's
really
the
test,
want
to
insure
that
when
individuals
or
entities
take
these
deductions
that
there's
a
degree
of
certainty
that
they
will
be
paid.
in
fact,
the
evidence
in
this
case
shows
that
all
of
the
accrued
liabilities
were
in
fact
paid.
that
remote
contingency,
i
suggest,
would
exist
in
any
situation,
and
any
accrual
basis
taxpayer
could
be
saddled
with
that.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
if
his
assets
are...
if
he
is
in
bankruptcy
and
if
his
assets
are
insufficient
to
satisfy...
if
it's
a
contractual
liability--
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
--but,
your
honor,
i
am
afraid
i
must
disagree
with
your
premise,
and
that
is,
you
said
there
is
no
liability
when
he
does
it.
we
say
there
is
this
liability
that
is
imposed
by
state
law.
i
think
your
question
goes
to
what
we
interpret
the
government's
argument
as
being,
that
is,
the
only
sort
of
liability
which
would
satisfy
the
all
events
test
is
a
bilateral
contractual
obligation.
we
say
that's
not
so,
because
the
all
events
test
doesn't
require
that.
the
government
is
really
trying
to
add
to
the
existing
all
events
test
the
notion
that
the
obligation
must
be
payable.
now,
in
u.s.
v.
anderson,
the
first
case,
the
obligation
there
was
not
payable
at
the
time
the
accrual
was
taken.
this
was
an
excise
tax
case
on
munitions.
the
taxpayer
sought
to
deduct
the
excise
tax
in
the
year
following
the
manufacture
and
sale.
in
1916
the
munitions
were
manufactured
and
sold.
the
tax
was
not
due
until
it
was
assessed
the
following
year.
the
taxpayer
took
the
position
that
the
government
is
taking
here.
it
said,
wait,
until
this
is
payable
by
the
assessment,
the
tax
is
not
going...
cannot
be
accrued.
the
tax
is
not
yet
due.
the
government
took
the
position
in
anderson
that
we're
taking
here,
and
said
the
liability
exists
at
the
and
of
the
manufacturing
and
sale,
similar
to
the
end
of
our
tax
year
here
by
the
operation
of
the
machines.
because
at
that
point,
all
events
necessary
to
fix
the
liability
had
occurred.
the
government
is
trying
to
turn
that
around
and
say
in
our
situation,
we
must
impose
on
the
all
events
test
the
additional
requirement
of
payability,
and
that
that
payability
would
exist
at
the
time
a
customer
pulls
the
winning
handle
of
the
slot
machine.
so,
we
say
that
we
are
on
all
fours
with
the
anderson
case,
and
that
to
adopt
the
government's
position
would
really
reconstruct
anderson
in
a
different
way
than
it's
existed
on
the
books
since
1926.
as
to
the
question
of
how
other...
so-called
regular
slot
machines
are
treated,
let
me
see
if
i
can
illustrate
our
liability
argument
in
that
way.
the
only
reason
we
say
we're
able
to
accrue
the
liability
for
the
progressive
slot
machines
is
because
of
the
existence
of
the
nevada
regulation,
statutes
and
policies
which
are
discussed
in
our
briefs.
those
pertain
only
to
the
progressive
slot
machines.
we
also
have
summary
judgment
evidence
in
the
form
of
affidavits
that
the
reason
for
the
existence
of
those
regulations
is
that
because
the
jackpot
amount
increases
with
each
play
on
all
the
casino
customers,
that
the
commission
views
that
as
being
an
investment,
if
you
will,
by
the
players
in
the
jackpot
amounts.
regular
slot
machines
don't
have
any
such
regulations.
we
would
say,
as
to
the
regular
slot
machines,
we're
not
entitled
to
and
we
do
not
accrue
those
liabilities.
those
could
be
taken
off
the
floor
at
any
time.
those
could
be
removed,
and
any
jackpots
on
regular
nonprogressive
machines
could
be
taken
off
at
any
time,
but
we're
not
permitted
under
the
regulations
to
remove
the
progressive
slot
machines.
once
they're
on
the
casino
floor
and
are
put
into
play,
they
must
stay
there
until
they're
won.
now,
in
this
case
we're
not
trying
to
anticipate
and
to
accrue
as
an
expense
the
amount
of
the
eventual
payout.
we
are
simply
taxing
the
amount
which
exists
or
the
machine
at
the
end
of
our
fiscal
year.
the
winning
of
the
jackpot
is
the
equivalent,
we
believe,
of
the
assessment
of
the
tax
in
anderson.
the
winning
of
a
jackpot
doesn't
fix
the
liability.
it
does
identify
a
payee,
but
the
record...
and
our
briefs
are
replete
with
cases
which
indicate
that
you
don't
really
have
to
be
able
to
identify
a
payee.
we
know
that
there
will
be
a
payee.
we
don't
have
to
identify
that
payee
by
name.
the
economic
and
the
practical
effect
of
the
regulation
is
that
we're
going
to
have
to
pay
that
jackpot,
and
in
fact
the
record
indicates
that
we
did
pay
all
of
these
progressive
jackpots.
what
the
government
is
trying
to
do,
we
believe,
is
to
impose
some
of
the
requirements
which
were
established
in
the
1984
legislation,
which
is
the
referred
to
as
the
tax
reform
act
of
1984
on
the
one
hand,
or
the
tax
deficit
act
of
1984
on
the
other,
which
established
in
addition
to
the
existing
law
and
regulations
on
the
all
events,
test,
it
established
a
principle
of
economic
performance.
we
believe
the
government
is
trying
to...
is
asking
this
court
to
judicially
legislate
in
this
case
a
principle
that
is
the
practical
equivalent
of
the
economic
performance
of
the
1984
legislation
which
is
applicable
only
to
deductions
that
occur
after
july
of
1984.
there
is,
however,
a--
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
--if
that's
an
enforceable
obligation
in
year
one,
he
may
accrue
that.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
in
the
second
year
the
tax
benefit
rule,
i
believe,
would
require
that
he
would
take
any
income
that--
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
--well,
i'm
responding
to
how
the
internal
revenue
service
would
construe
it.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
well,
as
i
said
earlier--
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
--i'm
not
sure,
your
honor.
i
wouldn't
want
to
speak
for
them.
but
the
law
is
absolutely
clear
that
these
remote
contingencies
such
as
bankruptcy
or
a
defense
for
promissory
note,
those
are
not
sufficient
to
destroy
accrual
at
the
time
the
accrual
is
taken.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
all
right.
if
the
machine
breaks
down,
under
the
regulations
and
policy
the
machine
can
be
taken
off
the
floor
for
a
brief
period
of
time
and
repaired.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
all
right.
then
the
amount
of
that
jackpot
must
be
added
to
another
machine.
if
it
has
$100
on
it,
that
$100
must
be
put
on
an
adjacent
machine
to
give
a
total
of
$200.
the
liability
must
remain
on
the
machines,
on
the
floor.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
your
honor,
the
nevada
gambling
industry
is
one
of
the
most
highly
regulated
industries
in
this
country.
the
affidavit
of
mr.
griffith
in
the
joint
appendix
indicates
that
they
count
the
jackpots
twice
a
day.
they
have
to
file
reports
with
the
gaming
commission,
i
believe
weekly.
it's
very
highly
regulated,
for
two
reasons.
one,
of
course,
in
any
industry
where
there's
a
lot
of
cash
exchanging
hands,
it's
to
everyone's
benefit
to
have
it
highly
regulated.
but
in
the
case
of
progressive
slot
machines,
as
i
alluded
to
earlier,
there
is
a
notion...
there
is
an
investment
concept
here.
since
players
are
putting
their
money
in,
and
increasing
the
amount
of
the
jackpot,
the
commission
wants
to
insure
that
those
jackpot
totals
remain
available
for
players
to
win
on
the
floor.
so,
i
think
there's
no
question
about
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
it's
highly
regulated
and
that
that
duty
imposed
by
the
nevada
gaming
commission
is
complied
with.
the
government
relies
on
the
nightingale
case.
it's
a
ninth
circuit
case
that
preceded
ours.
it's,
in
all
its
material
respects,
like
ours
factually.
nightingale
cited
a
number
of
cases
including
this
court's
brown
versus
helvering
opinion,
which
involved
cancellation
of...
accruing
of
liabilities
for
anticipated
insurance
policy
cancellations.
in
that
case,
we
simply
say
there's
no
fixed
liability.
there
is
no
way
to
determine
in
that
case
whether
indeed,
based
on
estimates
or
otherwise,
the
policies
would
in
fact
be
cancelled.
in
our
case
we
don't
rely
on
estimates.
we
have
the
amount
we
say
we
can
accrue,
on
the
machines.
it's
referred
to
as
a
meter
but
it's
really
a
large
display
meter.
that
is
the
amount
of
the
progressive
jackpot
which
must
be
maintained
in
play
and
which
the
evidence
shows
will
be
paid
out
on
the
average
of
four
and
a
half
months.
once
the
machine
is
in
play--
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
--well,
justice
rehnquist,
our
probability
is
100
percent
of
the
amount
shown.
we
don't
rely
on
estimates.
we
know
that
we
are
going
to
pay
the
total
of
all
the
amounts
reflected
at
the
end
of
the
fiscal
year.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
well,
we
don't
estimate
when
we're
going
to
pay
it.
no,
the
four
and
a
half
months
is
a
retrospective
average.
that
was
a
computation
made,
and
is
in
the
summary
judgment--
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
--no,
your
honor.
you
deduct
it
in
year
one.
you
accrue
it
in
year
one.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
you
deduct
it
in
year
one.
now,
the
greater--
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
--only
the
amount
shown
at
the
end
of
year
one,
that's
correct,
justice
rehnquist.
in
other
words,
at
the
end
of
year
one
if
it
shows
$100,
at
the
end
of
your
fiscal
year,
you
accrue
$100.
by
the
time
it
pays
off
it
might
have
gone
to
$400
and
you
will
in
fact
pay
the
$400.
we're
not
trying
to
deduct
that
$400.
we're
accruing
only
the
amount
that
exists
at
the
end
of
our
fiscal
year.
and,
as
the
period
of
time
goes
into
the
future,
we
recognize...
not
in
this
case
but
we
recognize
in
other
situations,
there
may
well
be
the
problem
of
a
clear
reflection
of
income.
and
the
1984
legislation
is
in
part
at
least
designed
to
impose
an
additional
requirement
to
the
all
events
test
which
would
prevent
the
accrual
of
these
liabilities
when
the
period
of
time
into
the
future
is
very
great.
there
is
an
exception
to
that,
which
is
the
recurring
item
exception,
which
imposes
an
eight
an
a
half
month
period,
and
we
believe
we
would
be
fully
satisfied
in
that
case.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
under--
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
--well,
in
our
case
they
have
not
challenged
that
our
accrual
clearly
reflects
income.
that
really
is
not
an
issue
here.
the
commissioner,
however,
does
the
authority
under
section
446(b)
to
in
effect
disallow
an
accounting
system
if
he
determines
that
it
does
not
clearly
reflect
income.
but
that...
that
authority
combined
with
the
'84
legislation
has
really
given
the
internal
revenue
service
some
new
teeth,
we
think.
we
don't
know
how
the
basic
legislation
there
would
apply
to
us.
it
talks
in
terms
of
property.
there
is
a
suggestion
that
money
is
not
property,
and
we
really
don't
know
pending
the
promulgation
of
regulations
where
we're
going
to
come
out
on
that,
but
we...
and
it's
really
not
involved
in
this
case,
but
it
seems
clear
to
us
that
we're
talking
about
the
exception,
which
means
we
would
be
permitted
to
continue
to
accrue
the
progressive
slot
machine
liabilities.
in
its
reply
brief
the
government
gave
an
example
of
a
golf
tournament,
an
irrevocable
pledge
in
year
one
by
a
company
to
sponsor
golf
tournaments,
perhaps
as
long
as
ten
years
in
the
future.
we
believe
that
if
the
obligation
is
irrevocable
and
the
tax...
the
all
events
test
is
satisfied.
again,
though,
the
longer
you
go
into
the
future,
the
more
likely
it
is
there
could
be
a
problem
with
clear
reflection
of
income.
but
just
to
set
us
where
we
stand,
from
their
example
and
their
brief,
we
believe
that...
and
the
example
in
which
the
payments
of
the
golf
tournaments
could
extend
ten
years
into
the
future,
we
believe
there
that
the
all
events
test
was
satisfied
but
that
the
taxpayer
there
might
well
have
an
additional
problem.
the
reason...
really
the
reason
for
the
all
events
test
is
to
insure
that
taxpayers
won't
obtain
deductions
for
expenditures
that
might
not
ever
occur,
and
we
think
we
satisfy
that,
and
we
don't
just
mean
you
have
to
look
retrospectively
in
order
to
see
that
we
did
pay
all
of
those
amounts
that
were
accrued.
we
think
we
satisfied,
because
the
sanction
that
can
be
imposed
on
a
casino
if
it
doesn't
pay
the
amounts
on
its
progressive
slot
machines
are
far
out
of
proportion
to
the
amount
in
controversy
in
this
case.
a
casino
can
lose
its
license.
it
can
be
fined
up
to
$250,000.
it
is
this
notion
of
state
law
and
the--
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
--if
the
casino
is
sold,
it
is
the
policy
of
the
gaming
commission...
that's
typically
what
happens.
one
entity
will
lose
the
license.
they
don't
board
the
casino
up.
someone
else
comes
in
and
assumes
the
license.
so,
it's...
to
my
knowledge
it's
always
an
instance
in
which
the
license
is
transferred.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
if
it's
transferred,
either
the
jackpots
must
be
paid
prior
to
the
transfer,
which
it
sounds
like
in
your
example
it
would
not
be,
or
they
must
be
assumed
by
the
purchaser
of
the
casino.
they
are
not
extinguished.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
and
there's
no
surviving
entity?
well,
in
that
situation,
judge--
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
--the
liabilities
are
not
assumed
on
these
machines,
and
the
tax
consequences
would
be,
of
course,
as
earlier
described,
they
would
take
into
income
in
the
year
of
sale
any
amounts
previously
deducted.
we
tried
to
refute
that
argument--
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
--so
that
you
can
no
longer
have
them
in
play?
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
well,
there's
no
remedy
available.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
because,
justice
white--
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
--the
all
events
test
and
the
fixing
of
liability
is
not
dependent
on
the
kind
of
remote
contingency
you
just
described.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
well,
your
honor,
the
liability
is
fixed.
now,
it
may
be
avoided.
you
may
avoid
paying
the
liability.
that
is
my
analysis.
the
liability
is
fixed
but
payment
for
that
liability--
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
--and
you
may
not
remove
your
machines
and
you
may
not
sell
your
casino
and
avoid
the
liabilities.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
that's
right,
but
that
affects
the
payment
rather
than
the
imposition
of
the
liability,
under
our
view
of
the
case.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
well,
again,
if
a
company
goes
into
bankruptcy
and
has
insufficient
assets
to
pay
its
liabilities,
it's
in
no
different
situation
than
we
are
there.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
it
they
can't
pay
them.
we...
in
your
example
the
jackpots
are
not
paid
to
people
who
win
them.
in
the
situation
in
which
the
company
goes
into
bankruptcy
and
doesn't
have
the
money,
these
are
not
paid
to
the
persons
to
whom
they--
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
--but
everybody
agrees
there's
a
liability.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
well,
no.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
i
understand,
your
honor.
there
are
other
cases
in
which
state
law
applies
liabilities.
there's
a
whole
series
of
coal
mining,
strip
mining
cases.
the
liability
there
is
imposed
not
by
bilateral
contract,
but
it's
imposed
by
state
law
which
requires
that
once
strip
mining
has
occurred,
the
mined
area
must
be
backfilled.
that's
exactly
what
we
have
here,
it's
imposed
by
state
law.
if
the
coal
companies...
and
there's
a
whole
line
of
cases
that
supports
our
view
on
that...
if
the
coal
companies
go
out
of
business
before
backfilling
those,
there's
no--
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
--a
casino
operator
will
probably
lose
his
license
and
be
fined
up
to
$250,000.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
well--
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
--we
have
addressed
that,
your
honor,
by
showing
how
the
progressive
slot
machine
productions
are
immaterial
compared
to
the
total
wealth
of...
and
revenues
of
the
casino.
they're
not
going
to
shut
down
their
casinos
in
order
to
save
$433,000
over
four
years.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
before
they
take
the
machines
off
the
floor,
they
must
address
the
issue
of
payment.
they
must
have
a
free-for
all
one
day
and
insure
that
all
those
progressive
slot
machine
jackpots
are
paid
prior
to
disposing
of
them,
justice
stevens.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
not
without
first
discharging
the
jackpot
liability.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
i
beg
your
pardon,
justice
marshall?
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
you
mean,
once
someone
has
won
it?
you
know
that--
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
--oh,
you
have
to
keep
them
in
play
until
they're
won.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
that's
correct,
justice
marshall,
but--
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
--if
they
sell
them
to
atlantic
city
before
delivering
them
to
atlantic
city,
they
must
first
make
provision
for
paying
those
progressive
jackpots
to
their
customers
in
las
vegas.
mr.
o.
clayton
lilienstern
keep
them
in
play
until
they're
won,
justice
marshall.
you
can't...
in
other
words,
you
cannot
sell
them
and
deliver
them
tomorrow.
you
must
discharge
that
liability
first.
