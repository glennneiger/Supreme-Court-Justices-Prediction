mr.
richard
k.
willard
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
from
1950
until
1983,
social
security
coverage
for
state
and
local
government
employees
was
essentially
voluntary.
under
the
statute
as
it
them
existed,
the
states
could
opt
into
the
social
security
system
for
groups
of
their
employees
and
then,
complying
with
certain
conditions,
opt
those
coverage
groups
of
employees
back
out
of
the
system.
by
1983,
with
the
legislation
at
issue
today
in
this
case,
it
was
enacted
by
congress,
more
than
nine
million
of
about
13
million
state
and
local
government
employees
were
in
the
social
security
system.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
it
certainly
does,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
in
fact
the
district
court
assumed
arguendo
that
was
the
case,
and
appellees
in
this
case
do
not
argue
to
the
contrary
either.
and
that
really
presents
the
question
of
what
the
district
court's
holding
means,
because
if
the
court's
holding
meant
that
the
nine
million
employees
now
in
social
security
coverage
had
a
perpetual
right
of
withdrawal
at
the
instance
of
their
states,
it
would
be
quite
a
sweeping
holding
that
these
nine
million
employees
now
in
social
security
could
be
pulled
out
indefinitely
whenever
their
states
wanted
to
pull
them
out.
but,
as
the
chief
justice's
question
pointed
out,
that
is
not
the
basis
for
the
holding
of
the
district
court.
the
court
assumes
that
congress
could
pass
a
law
mandating
coverage
for
all
social
security...
for
all
state
and
local
employees,
or
presumably
a
rationally
defined
subset.
and
so,
the
question
is,
what
is
this
case
about,
and
it...
the
answer
seems
to
me,
it
is
about
legislative
draftsmanship.
that
is,
the
advice
we
are
told
is
that
congress
chose
a
drafting
technique
in
the
statute
to
make
the
section
418
agreements
non-terminable.
if
congress
had
simply
ignored
the
section
418
agreement,
provided
for
coverage
for
these
employees
outside
of
the
pre-existing
agreements,
then
there
would
be
no
problem
with
the
arrangement.
and
this
quibble
about
legislative
drafting
really
cannot
possibly
rise
to
the
level
of
a
constitutional
violation,
as
this
court
held
in
usery
against
turner
elkhorn
mining
company,
that
the
choice
of
statutory
language
cannot
invalidate
this
kind
of
statute
when
its
operation
and
effect
are
permissible.
indeed,
the
option
that
the
appellees
would
prefer
in
this
case
would
be
more
destructive,
not
less
destructive,
of
vested
contract
rights
because
under
the
mandatory
coverage
option
the
section
418
agreements
in
their
entirety
would
go
out
the
window,
not
just
one
provision,
one
strand
out
of
the
bundle
of
sticks
which
has
been
affected
by
the
1983
amendments.
if
you
look
at
the
effect
of
the
1983
amendments,
it
is
not
harsh
and
oppressive.
the
states
and
their
employees
retain
the
primary
benefit
that
caused
them
to
opt
into
coverage
of
the
social
security
system;
that
is,
coverage
in
a
comprehensive
scheme
of
death,
disability
and
retirement
benefits
for
their
employees.
now,
much
is
made
of
the
financial
impact
on
the
state
and
local
governments
by
requiring
their
employees
to
stay
in
social
security.
but
let's
be
blunt
about
it.
the
financial
savings
to
the
states
from
withdrawing
their
employees
from
social
security
coverage
is
brought
about
because
either
they
provide
no
benefits
to
replace
the
benefits
that
are
lost,
or
because
they
provide
cheaper
benefits
to
replace
the
benefits
that
are
lost.
the
legislative
history
of
1983
amendments,
and
i
would
refer
the
court
specifically
to
the
1982
house
ways
and
means
committee
print,
documents
that
congress
was
very
concerned
about
the
harm
to
employees
from
their
employers'
terminating
social
security
coverage,
and
the
inadequacy
of
benefits
that
would
be
provided,
if
at
all,
to
the
employees
who
withdraw.
as
the
statute...
the
section
418
agreements
previously,
which
permitted
withdrawal
of
coverage,
did
not
require
a
referendum
or
vote
of
the
employees
before
their
coverage
was
terminated.
it
did
not
require
the
states
to
provide
a
comparable
level
of
benefits
to
replace
those
that
were
being
terminated.
basically,
what
it
permitted,
what
the
appellees
in
this
case
argue,
is
that
whenever
the
local
governments
feel
they
need
to
save
money,
and
they
want
to
save
money
by
ending
social
security
coverage
for
their
employees,
then
it's
okay
for
them
to
do
it.
now,
it's
not
true
that
all
employees
are
necessarily
harmed
by
the
termination
of
coverage.
some
employees,
particularly
the
older
ones,
can
receive
a
windfall
benefit
to
the
extent
their
social
security
benefits
are
rather
largely
vested
by
the
time
coverage
is
withdrawn,
when
they
can
take
the
money
they
were
putting
into
social
security,
invest
it
in
some
kind
of
alternative
savings
or
retirement
scheme,
and
then
when
they
get
to
retirement
age
they
can
be
double
dippers.
they
can
get
social
security
benefits
which
they
haven't
paid
for,
once
their
coverage
is
withdrawn,
and
they
can
get
benefits
from
this
alternative
program
they
may
have
invested
into.
but
this
is
also
a
problem
congress
could
take
into
account,
and
was
motivated
by
this
1983
amendment,
that
is,
a
desire
to
prevent
windfall
benefits
to
some
employees
as
a
result
of
having
been
in
the
system
for
a
while
and
then
opting
back
out
of
the
system,
and
putting
their
money
somewhere
else.
these
purposes,
that
is,
the
purpose
of
protecting
employees
from
the
disadvantages
of
having
coverage
withdrawn,
and
the
goal
of
preventing
windfall
benefits
to
other
employees
whose
coverage
was
terminated,
are
the
very
typical
kinds
of
legislative
motives
which
congress
can
use
to
base
economic
and
social
legislation,
in
which
this
court
routinely
sustains
with
very
minimal
scrutiny.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
there
are
programs
that
are
implemented
in
a
similar
way,
justice
brennan.
for
example,
the
mini-coverage
such
as
afdc
and
so
forth
are
cooperative
programs
and
the
states
are
not
required
to
participate
in
the
programs
if
they
don't
want
to,
and
those
programs
involve
similar
kinds
of
conditions,
as
we
argued
in
our
brief.
now,
it
is
true
that
this
program
is
somewhat
unique
in
that
in
1950
when
it
was
adopted
congress
was
concerned
that
there
might
be
a
constitutional
problem
if
they
mandated
coverage
of
state
employees
and
social
security.
that
problem
is
one
which
is
no
longer
considered
to
be
a
serious
problem,
but
at
the
time
they
did
envision
a--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--that
was
presumably
the
problem,
justice
o'connor,
that
concerned
them.
now,
we
don't
think
under
this
court's
tenth
amendment
jurisprudence
that
that
would
have
been
a
serious
problem,
even
prior
to
the
garcia
decision,
because
social
security
involves
the
taxing
and
spending
power
and
not
the
commerce
clause
power,
but
in
any
event
there
was
enough
uncertainty
that
this
was
to
some
extent
a
unique
program
because
of
that
constitutional
problem.
but
in
substance,
in
effect,
it
is
similar
to
many
other
kinds
of
cooperative
state-federal
programs
in
that
they
give...
they
are
based
on
statutes
and
the
agreements
are
simply
a
means
of
implementing
the
statutory
scheme
and
not
something
that
has
a
life
of
its
own.
and
therefore,
when
congress
changes
the
economic
and
social
judgment
that
motivated
the
scheme,
as
it
did
in
1983,
this
is
the
kind
of
change
which
is
not
normally
brought
to
destroy
some
vested
rights
but
instead
is
an
exercise
of
the
kind
of
judgment
which
congress
routinely
exercises
and
which
this
court
routinely
defers
to
congress
on.
so,
the
question
is
really,
it
seems,
how
did
the
district
court
go
so
far
wrong
in
this
kind
of
a
text,
and
i
think
the
answer
is,
it
was
only
by
exalting
form
over
substance
by
applying
a
very
formalistic
analysis
to
the
transaction
here,
that
the
district
court
was
able
to
hold
that
it
was
unconstitutional.
it
created
in
effect
a
house
of
cards,
and
there
are
a
number
of
defects
in
its
analysis,
any
one
of
which
serves
to
unravel
the
construction
of
the
district
court.
in
the
first
place,
even
on
the
most
literal
terms,
the
section
418
agreements
were
authorized
by
the
statute
and
had
reference
to
the
statutory
scheme.
the
right
to
withdraw
or
terminate
coverage
on
two
years'
notice
was
based
on
the
statute.
it
was
not
something
that
was
negotiated
or
bargained
for
in
the
contractual
process.
it
was...
the
agreement
simply
tracked
the
statutory
language.
california
could
not
have
negotiated
a
different
provision
even
if
it
had
wanted
to.
this
is
simple
boilerplate
language.
it
was
taken
out
of
the
statute
and
put
into
the
agreements.
the
statute
also,
in
section
1304--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--that
is
certainly
possible,
justice
white,
but
it
was
distinctly
a
minor--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--there
is
no
evidence
about
what
the
state
of
mind
was
of
the
state
when
it
entered
into
the
agreements.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
the
reason,
justice
white,
appears
to
be,
and
the
1982
legislative
history
corroborates
this,
is
that
they
thought
it
was
simply
a
necessary
incident
of
having
a
voluntary
program.
if
you
think
that
the
constitution
means
that
you
can
only
have
voluntary
coverage,
then
they
put
an
opt-out
provision
as
reflective
of
that,
not
as
an
inducement
of
the
states
to
enter,
but
as
a
reflection
of
what
they
thought
the
constitution
might
be
thought
to
have
required
at
the
time.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
most
categorically,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
it
had
been...
in
that
sense
it's
much
like
the--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--no,
there
isn't,
mr.
justice
white,
but
if
i
could
refer
to
el
paso
against
simmons,
a
case
where
the
court
held
that
the
perpetual
right
of
redemption
of
interest
defaulters
in
texas
was
not
the
key
inducement
of
the
contract,
and
in
that
case
the
court
didn't
go
back
and
consider
evidence
about
the
state
of
mind
of
purchasers
under
that
contract.
it
analyzed
the
contract
and
found
that
the
perpetual
right
of
redemption
was
a
very
minor
strand
in
the
bundle
of
contract
rights
that
were
obtained.
here
too,
the
major
benefit
of
the
states
was
enrolling--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--i
don't
have
the
exact
number.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
there
were.
there
were
several
hundred
thousand
employees,
i
think
covered,
out
of
nine
million.
so,
there
was
a
noticeable
amount.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
that
is
not
necessarily
evidence
of
the
importance
of
that
in
1950,
justice
white.
in
fact,
the
legislative
history
shows
that
for
many
years
it
was
never...
it
was
not--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--it
may
provide
an
evidence
about
the
intent
of
the
states
today,
but
with
all
respect,
i
think
that
as
to
their
intent
in
1950,
and
the
legislative
history
indicates...
this
was
congress's
view,
this
was
a
very
minor
provision
of
the
contract.
it
was
not
the
primary--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--if
that
were
the
state's
understanding
now,
then
that
could
have
an
impact.
the
question,
though,
is
not
what
is
the
understanding
of
states
now,
but
what
was
it
in
1951
when
the
states
opted
into
this
coverage,
and
there
is
no
evidence
on
the
record
that
california
subjectively
viewed
this
as
being
particularly
important.
in
fact,
the
legislative
history...
again,
i
would
refer
especially
to
the
1982
committee
print,
indicates
congress
felt
that
this
was
not
a
major
inducement
to
entering
into
the
agreements.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
i'm
not
saying
it's
superfluous.
it
was
one
small
strand
of
the
rather
large
bundle
of
rights
and
responsibilities
of
the
contractual
relationship
that
was
entered
into.
it's
not
our
position
it
was
a
worthless
provision.
it
obviously
had
some
meaning.
but,
in
comparison
with
the
overall
package
of
benefits
that
were
created
under
the
act,
this
was
a
fairly
minor
provision.
and
in
fact,
during
the
first
20
years
that
this
provision
was
in
effect,
it
was
very
rarely
used.
it's
only
in
recent
years
that
it's
come
to
be
called
into
greater
use
which
would
indicate
that
when
it
was
originally
entered
into
it
was
not
a
major
motivating
cause
of
the
contract.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
have
just
been
referring
to
section
1304
of
the
act
which
provides
express
notice
of
congress's
reservation
of
the
right
to
amend,
repeal
or
alter
the
social
security
act,
and
this
was
part
of
the
act
at
the
time
the
section
418
agreements
were
entered
into
in
1951,
and
certainly
provided
notice
that
the
statutory
pattern
was
subject
to
change.
i'd
like
to
turn
now,
though,
to
the
question
about,
even
if
there
was
abrogation
of
a
vested
contract
right,
which
was
important
to
the
parties
when
it
was
entered
into,
whether
this
constitutes
a
taking
within
the
meaning
of
the
just
compensation
clause
under
this
court's
analysis,
and
i
think
it
is
fairly
clear
that
it
does
not.
the
factors
that
are
used
by
the
court
vary.
they
were
most
recently
restated
this
term,
in
connolly
versus
pension
benefit
guaranty
corporation,
which
reiterated
some
of
the
factors,
the
character
of
the
government
action,
the
economic
impact
and
the
interference
with
reasonable
investment-backed
expectation.
in
all
of
these
cases,
i
think
when
you
look
at
the
totality
of
the
social
security
program
and
the
impact
of
participation
in
that
program
by
the
states,
the
termination
of
the
right
to
withdraw
is
not
at
such
a
level
as
to
constitute
a
taking
under
this
court's
teachings.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
that
is
not
our
position,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
united
states
is
never
bound
by
provision
in
its
contracts.
our
position
is
that
the
contract
here
was
part
of
a
statutory
scheme.
it
was
authorized
only
to
the
extent
that
it
was
consistent
with
the
statutory
scheme,
and
where
there
was
an
expressed
reservation
in
the
statute
of
the
right
to
alter
and
amend
the
statute,
that
the
parties
understood
the
contract
was
subject
to
further
modification
as
part
of
modification
of
the
statutory
scheme.
and
so,
in
that
sense
it's
not
like
a
debt
contract
where
you
would
say
the
united
states
would
not
be
authorized
to
simply
repudiate
it
without
regard
to
the
consequences.
but
each--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--well,
that
is
certainly
our
position
in
this
case,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
it
is
not
a
position
that
the
district
court
or
any
of
the
appellees
have
seriously
disagreed
with.
they
have
assumed
that
that
was
the
case,
where
it
could
happen.
and
in
that
light
as
well,
i
think
that
the
takings
analysis
shows
that
there
is
not
a
serious
interference
with
a
vested
right.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
it
would
certainly
place
the
case
in
a
different
light,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
the
government
could
only
impose
this
kind
of
obligation
by
contract,
then
for
the
government
to
unilaterally
change
the
terms
of
the
contract
in
a
way
of
this
nature
would
present
a
more
serious
argument.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
well,
certainly,
justice
rehnquist,
we
do
not
argue
here
that
the
executive
has
a
right
to
break
contracts
at
all.
this
revision
of
the
contracts
is
done
pursuant
to
the
congress
in
the
1983
amendments.
it
would
be
quite
another
case
for
the
executive
on
its
own
to
try
to
disown
the
contract.
what
we
are
talking
about
is
the
power
of
congress
to
legislate
an
achieve
a
legislative
end,
which
everyone
has
assumed
is
permissible,
that
is,
mandating
that
social
security
coverage
remain
for
government...
state
and
local
government
employees
to
have
that
coverage.
and
so,
it's
not
a
situation
where
the
executive
is
saying,
we
want
to
unilaterally
alter
a
contract,
or
to
ignore
a
contract.
it
is
a
situation
where
congress
is
exercising
its
authority
to
change
the
scope
of
coverage
in
the
social
interest.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
well,
the
question
that
everyone
is
assuming,
and
i
think
the
case
law
is
clear,
that
congress
could
do
that
if
it
chose
to
do
so,
in
effect
and
that
the...
that
congress...
that
the
nine
million
state
and
local
government
employees
covered
by
social
security
don't
have
a
perpetual
right
of
withdrawal
as
a
result
of
the
section
418
agreements
entered
into.
if
they
were
to
acquire
that,
that
would
have
been
a
contract
which
would
have
bargained
away
governmental
authority
to
could
not
be
bargained
away.
the
basis
of
the
district
court's
holding
in
this
case,
and
the
essence
of
the
claim
by
appellees,
is
the
takings
claim;
that
is,
there
was
a
vested
contract
right
here
that
was
taken
away,
and
this
was
an
uncompensated
taking.
and
yet,
the
purposes
of
the
takings
clause
are
quite
different.
as
the
court
referred
to
this
term
in
connolly
for
the
purpose
of
forbidding
uncompensated
takings
of
private
property
for
public
use,
is
to
bar
the
government
from
forcing
some
people
around
to
bear
public
burdens
which
in
all
fairness
and
justice
could
be
borne
by
the
people
as
a
whole.
and
actually,
that's
what
the
1983
amendments
did.
they
are
spreading
the
burdens
and
benefits
of
participating
in
the
social
welfare
scheme
to
a
broad
class
of
employees
that
otherwise
would
be
given
a
right
to
withdraw,
and
so
in
that
sense
what
congress
did
here
is
the
antithesis
of
what
the
takings
clause
was
designed
to
protect
against,
in
that
it
spreads
a
benefit
and
a
burden
among
a
large
group
of
public,
rather
than
causing
a
small
group
of
people
to
bear--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--it
certainly
does.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
well,
i
think
the
legislative
history--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--the
states
and
their
employees
are
of
course
forced
to
bear
an
economic
burden,
but
they
are
also
receiving
benefits
for
it.
they're
receiving
social
security
coverage
for
death,
for
disability
and
retirement.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
well,
justice
white,
as
i
indicated
they're
not
required
to
spend
that
money
on
taking
care
of
their
employees.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
that
is
certainly
the
effect
of
this
legislation.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
that's...
the
government
did
not
promise
that,
specifically,
in
our
view,
because
the
statute--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--section
1304
of
the
statute
gave
notice
that
the
scheme
was
subject
to
alteration,
repeal
and
amendment.
in
that
case
it's
a
lot
like
the
sinking
fund
cases.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
that's
our
position.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
that
is
our
position,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
it's
a
position
which
no
one
has
disagreed
with,
not
the
district
court,
not
the
appellees.
everyone
has
been
willing
to
assume
that
congress
could
not
contract
away
the
authority
to
make
these
people
subject
to
social
security,
and
it
is
our
position,
in
fact
they
did
not
do
it.
but,
whether
they
did
or
didn't,
it's...
the
bottom
line
of
this
analysis
is
that
congress
has
to
maintain
a
reserve
power
to
tax
and
spend
for
the
general
welfare
in
this
method.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
well,
a
small
number
of
them
did.
but,
we
believe
there
is
a
rational
distinction,
justice
stevens,
between
keeping
people
in
the
system
who
are
already
in,
and
not
covering
people
who
are
out.
most
people--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--well,
that
would
depend
on
what
the
rationale
was,
justice
stevens.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
that's
not
the
way
that
this
statute
operates.
it
doesn't
distinguish
among
states
arbitrarily.
it
basically
says,
people
who
are
in
the
system
now
have
to
stay
in
the
system,
and
there
is
good
reason
for
that.
people
who
opt
in
and
out
of
the
system
can
receive
this
kind
of
a
windfall
benefit
because
their
rights
may
have
vested,
for
many
of
these
employees,
and
then
when
they
withdraw
they
got
the
windfall
of
keeping
social
security
coverage
and
not
having
to
pay
for
it,
as
opposed
to
many
of
the
employees,
the
4
million
employees
who
are
not
covered.
most
of
those
have
never
been
covered
by
social
security
and
therefore
you
don't
have
the
same
kind
of
inequity
that
you
do
when
people
opt
in
and
opt
out.
it
was
the
movement
in
and
out
of
the
system
that
the
legislative
history
shows
congress
was
particularly
concerned
about,
and
i
think
that
creates
more
than
enough
of
a
rational
basis
for
the
distinction
they
drew
here,
in
effect.
now,
i
think
that
concludes
what
i
prepared
for
my
argument,
unless
there
are
further
questions
of
the
court
at
this
time.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
i
could
mention
briefly,
first,
this
court
noted
in
its
recent
opinion
in
pension
and
benefit
guaranty
corporation
against
r.
a.
gray
and
company
that
the
framers
specifically
rejected
a
proposed
amendment
to
the
constitution
that
would
have
subjected
the
federal
government
to
the
contract
clause.
so,
far
from
simply
omitting
it,
it
is
something
that
was
considered
and
rejected
by
the
framers,
as
this
court's
unanimous
opinion
in
r.
a.
gray
noted.
in
comparing
the
contract
situation
with
the
constraints
on
the
federal
government's
repudiation
on
debt
as
brought
about
in
the
lynch
case,
i
think
we
can
see
some
real
comparisons.
in
lynch
we
had
a
situation
where
we
had
a
contractual
scheme
that
was
repudiated
outright
by
the
government
by
simply
repealing
the
authorizing
statute,
thus
in
effect
repudiating
the
debt
totally
and
leaving
nothing
in
its
place.
and
in
fact,
the
solicitor
general
in
the
lynch
case
refused
to
offer
any
kind
of
police
power
or
public
welfare
justification
for
the
repudiation.
now,
the
only
reason
the
government
did
it
was,
they
wanted
to
save
money.
they
owed
money.
they
wanted
to
save
money.
they
repudiated
the
debt.
now,
in
this
case,
however,
we
have
a
situation
where--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--that
would
have
kind
of
made
a
difference.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
justice
white,
i
think
if
the
contract...
if
the
statute
had
included
that
reserved
right
expressly--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--if
that's
what
it
said--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--if
that's
what
it
provided.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
in
this
case
it
did.
but
it's
quite
different
because,
for
example,
suppose
that
congress
had
repealed
section
418
outright.
no
one
would
claim
that
the
states
would
have
a
right
to
insist
on
participating
in
social
security
if
section
418
were
repealed,
and
the
social
security
program
were
terminated
in
its
entirety.
that
would
have
rendered
those
agreements
totally
worthless,
and
yet
they
could
have
been
repealed
outright
and
there
wouldn't
have
been
a
problem.
the
fact
here
is
that
congress
did
something
milder,
much
less
of
a
violence
to
the
contract,
because
they
simply
repealed...
one
provision
was
rendered
moot,
not
the
entire
contractual
scheme.
and
so,
here
the
reservation
of
right
to
do
this
is
much
less
inclusive
than
what
congress
could
have
done,
and
which
the
appellees
in
this
case
don't
really
disagree
with.
the
important
thing
to
keep
in
mind,
though,
is
that
it's
not
simply
repudiation
of
debt.
congress
made
a
judgment
there
was
a
public
welfare
purpose
to
be
served
for
the
benefit
of
the
employees
of
state
and
local
governments,
of
keeping
them
in
social
security
coverage,
that
if
your
employers
wanted
to
save
money
by
terminating
your
social
security
coverage,
that
that
was
a
bad
thing,
that
for
the
benefit
of
the
welfare
of
the
employees
as
well
as
for
the
integrity
of
the
social
security
system.
and
so,
this
isn't
a
case
where
congress
said,
we
want
to
save
some
money
for
the
federal
government
so
we're
going
to
repudiate
our
debts.
this
is
a
situation,
and
the
legislative
history
abundantly
documents
it,
where
congress
was
concerned
about--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--that
would
present
a
case...
well,
that
would
present
a
case
that
would
be
closer
to
the
lynch
situation.
i
think
still,
given
section
1304,
congress
reserved
the
right
to
do
that
in
setting
up
the
original
statutory
scheme.
but
here,
the
legislative
history
carefully
documents
that
congress
had
additional
motives,
not
simply
to
save
money
for
the
system.
you
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
the
social
security
coverage
is
a
two-way
street.
while
it's
true
that
the
states
and
their
employees
pay
money
into
the
system,
they
also
receive
benefits.
and
so,
by
keeping
coverage
for
these
employees,
congress
is
not
simply
saying,
we
want
to
keep
getting
money
and
giving
nothing
in
return.
the
employees
are
receiving
something
in
return,
that
is,
the
death,
disability
and
retirement
benefits.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
well,
i
don't
think
that's
necessarily
true,
justice
stevens,
and
the
legislative
history
carefully
documents
it,
that
in
most
of
these
cases
congress
found
that
the
employees
were
not
getting
a
better
bargain
elsewhere.
they
were
receiving
coverage
that
was
less
comprehensive
than
social
security
coverage.
for
example,
it
is
not
portable.
social
security
coverage
goes
with
you
from
job
to
job,
whereas
coverage
in
a
state
or
local
pension
plan
may
not
go
with
you
if
you
moved
outside
of
coverage,
and
the
legislative
history
shows
that
congress
was
concerned
about
the
lack
of
portability
of
benefits,
especially
for
younger
employees
who
would
be
very
seriously
disadvantaged
if
they
didn't
have
social
security
coverage.
that,
after
all,
is
the
rationale
for
having
a
nearly
universal
social
insurance
scheme,
because
it
provides
a
level
of
benefits
to
people,
whether
they
move
from
one
job
to
another
or
not.
and
that's
the
kind
of
judgment
congress
made
here,
and
which
they
are
entitled
to
make.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--well,
the
legislative
history
has
some
information
about
it
in
general,
although
it
doesn't
document
what
happened
in
each
case.
it
says
that
most
of
the
cases,
that
the
states
did
try
to
provide
alternative
coverage,
but
congress
found
the
alternative
coverage
provided
was
not
as
good
as
social
security
coverage.
in
other
words,
it
wasn't
as
comprehensive
and
it
certainly
didn't
provide
the
portability
feature,
that
is,
the
fact
that
the
coverage
would
move
with
the
employee
from
one
job
to
another.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
it
said
in
most
of
the
cases,
but
there's
no
legal
requirement,
justice
powell,
that
they
provide
it.
in
other
words,
under
the
statute,
and
they
are
in
the
position
of
the
appellees
here,
if
they
just
wanted
to
save
the
money
by
providing
nothing
in
return
for
cancelling
social
security,
they
could
do
it.
and
that
is
the
right
we
are
insisting
on
being
able
to
use.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
apparently
they're
not
willing
to
assert
that
kind
of
a
claim
because
they're
not
that
sure
of
themselves.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
well,
that's
the
essence
of
our
position,
justice
white,
is
that
since
it
wouldn't
make
a
difference
those
vested
contract
rights
such
as
they
are
couldn't
be
worth
very
much
if
they
wouldn't
stand
up
in
the
face
of
that
kind
of
legislative
enactment.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
no
one
has
disagreed
with
that,
including
the
district
court
and
the
appellees.
they
are
willing
to
assume
it.
and
of
course,
we
argue
in
our
brief
that
congress
has
the
power
to
do
that.
