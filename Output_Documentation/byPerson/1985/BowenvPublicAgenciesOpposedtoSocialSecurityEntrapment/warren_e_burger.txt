chief
justice

e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
bowen
against
public
agencies.
mr.
willard,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
your
position,
your
argument,
assume
that
congress
could
have
put
all
of
them
under
social
security
in
the
first
instance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--you
rejected
that
idea,
that
it
was
bait
for
the
states?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
i'd
have
to
say
it
was
superfluous.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
at
1:00
o'clock,
mr.
willard.
mr.
willard,
you
may
resume.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
willard,
do
you
take
the
position
that...
at
least
indirectly,
that
the
united
states
is
not
bound
by
a
provision
which
it
makes
in
one
of
its
own
contracts,
and
if
it
could
have
made
the
contract
without
that
provision?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
that's
bottomed
on
your
early
premise
that
you
mentioned
before
lunch,
that
the
government,
without
consulting
any
of
the
states
or
the
local
governments,
could
have
made
all
of
their
employees
subject
to
social
security
from
the
outset?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
that
were
not
so,
if
the
government
could
not
have
exercised
that
authority,
then
would
you
say
they
would
be
bound
by
the
contract
provision?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
don't
you
have
to
persuade
the
court...
mr.
willard,
doesn't
the
government
have
to
persuade
the
court
that
given
the
right
which
you
have
asserted,
that
congress
could
have
put
this
on
every
employee
of
every
one
of
the
governmental
subdivisions
in
the
first
place,
that
authority
could
not
be
contracted
away
by
the
provision
which
is
in
question
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
willard.
mr.
hurwitz.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
you
say
that
the
contract
is
binding
and
that
the
federal
sovereign
authority
could
make
a
waiver
of
a
sovereign
right
which
it
had?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then,
could
the
federal
government
assert
its
sovereign
right,
to
put
everybody
under,
as
they
could
have
in
the
first
place?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
that's
true,
then
what
are
we
spending
all
the
time
on?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
the
government
in
its
sovereign
authority
tomorrow
decides
to
acknowledge
the
right
of
the
states
to
terminate
but
also
hits
them
under
social
security
beginning
at
midnight
on
the
same
time
as
the
termination.
where
are
you
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wait
a
minute.
i
thought
you
had
conceded
that
the
government
had
this
sovereign
power
to
put
everybody
under
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
the
government
makes
a
contract
which
it
is
not
legally
authorized
to
make?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
entire
contract,
or
just
the
particular
unlawful
clause?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
willard?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
