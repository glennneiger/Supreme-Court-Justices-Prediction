that
isn't
to
say
it
was
negotiable
or
not
from
the
statement
that
i...
part
of
it
might
certainly
true,
that
without
that
statutory
provision
they
never
would
have
entered
into
this.
justice
byron
r.
white
--for
the
foundation
to
be
probable,
you
really
don't
know,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
do
you
think
congress
wrote
it
in,
just
as
a--
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
no
evidence
to
the
contrary,
is
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
many
states
wanted
to
withdraw
at
the
time
that
that
was
an
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
were
quite
a
few,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
fact
is,
it
would
appear
that
the
right
to
withdrawal
was
a
rather
important
item?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
certainly
looks
more
in
that
direction
than
in
yours.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
some
state
that
had
never
been
in
the
program
was
thinking
about
getting
into
it
now.
wouldn't
you
think
in
light
of
what's
going
on
that
the
right
to
withdraw
would
be
a
very
important
matter?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
disallowing
withdrawal
costs
the
states
some
money,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
quite
a
bit,
otherwise
you
wouldn't
have
been
interested
in
abrogating
this
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
does
cost
them
some
money,
an
so
why
isn't
the
taking,
the
taking
of
the
money,
not
contract
right...
they're
forcing
the
state
to
pay
some
money.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know.
the
state
says
that,
you're
taking
our
money
that
we'd
like
to
spend
on
some
other
way
of
taking
care
of
our
employees.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
but,
they
are...
but
the
state
is
now
being
required
to
spend
some
money
that
it
thought
it
had
the
right
to
refuse
to
spend?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
the
government
promised
that
they
wouldn't
have
to
spend?
justice
byron
r.
white
--specifically,
nonspecifically,
or
unspecifically?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
provision
means
that
although
you...
that
means
that
we
can
amend
this
contract
to
eliminate
the
withdrawal
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
could
you
have
sued
the
united
states
on
a
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
think
it
would.
you
want
some
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
don't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
inverse
[inaudible].
justice
byron
r.
white
that's...
do
you
want
an
injunction?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
that
case,
i
take
it,
it
wouldn't
have
made
any
difference
if
the
government
had
reserved
in
its
initial
contract
the
power
to
amend
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
like
saying,
we've
now
decided
to
amend
this
by
not
paying
you
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
just
generally,
we
have
the
power
to
amend?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
a
person
said
it...
it
just
includes
a
general
power
to
amend,
and
so
it
could
amend
and
say,
we
know
you've
performed
an
awful
lot
of
work
for
us
but
we're
not
going
to
pay
you
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
isn't
what
the
contract
provided
expressly.
it
just
said,
we
have
the
power
to
amend.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
willard,
suppose
congress
said...
they
passed
a
law
putting
all
the
states
under...
purporting
to
put
all
the
states
under
this
social
security
system.
wouldn't
the...
why
would
the
contract
claim
be
any
different?
california
says,
well,
look,
you
may
have
passed
the
statute,
but
remember
we
have
a
contract
which
we
should
be
able
to
be
in
or
out
of,
is
social
security.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
i
just
wondered
what
difference
it
would
make.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
issue,
whether
congress
has
the
power
to
put
them
all
in
or
not,
isn't
in
this
case,
is
it?
