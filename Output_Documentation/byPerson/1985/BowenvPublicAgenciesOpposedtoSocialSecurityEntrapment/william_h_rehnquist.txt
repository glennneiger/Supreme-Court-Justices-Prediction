justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
doesn't
it
make
a
lot
of
difference
whether
the
government
is
acting
without
the
authorization
of
congress,
and
who
do
we
mean
when
we
are
saying
the
government
here,
whether
the
government
is
acting
at
the
express
authorization
of
congress
or
whether
it's
just...
the
executive
branch
is
deciding
to
break
a
contract,
about
which
perhaps
congress
has
said
nothing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
congress
is
unilaterally
altering
the
contract.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
fact
it's
unique,
mr.
hurwitz,
doesn't
mean
it's
unconstitutional.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
by
the
contracts
clause,
but
by
the
takings
clause?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
sort
of
an
analog
is
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
thorpe
a
holding
to
that
effect?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
hurwitz,
there
were
some
cases
decided
during
the
'30s,
dodge
being
one
of
them,
where
the
depression
came
and
contract
rights
of
teachers
and
other
public
employees
were
cut
back
on
by
states,
and
the
states
generally
won
those
cases.
i
suppose
if
they
had
had
the
foresight
to
think
of
the
takings
clause
rather
than
the
contracts
clause,
they
may
have...
maybe
they
would
have
lost.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
wasn't
dodge
between
the
state
agency
or...
otherwise
you
wouldn't
get
into
it
at
all,
you
wouldn't
get
into
the
prohibition
against
impairment
of
contracts
if
you
simply
had
a
private
party.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
the
case
would
have
come
out
differently
if
the
act
had
been
passed
by
the
county
board
of
supervisors
rather
than
by
the
state?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
isn't
the
governmental
agency
and
the
state
the
same
for
constitutional
purposes
in
that
situation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
disagree,
then,
with
the
government's
reading
of
perry
against
united
states
that
was
based
solely
on
the
monetary
clause?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
congress
has
expressly
authorized
the
government
to
break
the
contract?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
therefore,
any
breach
of
contract
that
congress
authorizes
is
automatically
a
violation
of
the
takings
clause?
that's
your
position?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
u.s.
trust
was
an
impairment
of
contracts
clause
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
you
agree
has
no
application
to
the
federal
government?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
a
specific
clause
of
the
constitution,
that
is
involved
here,
that
doesn't
apply
to
the
federal
government.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
why
do
you
derive
so
much
comfort
from
that
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
clause
on
which
that
case
depended,
which
interpreted
it,
applies
to
the
states
but
not
to
the
united
states?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
argument
by
analogy
should
have
been
made
at
the
constitutional
convention.
perhaps
the
framers
would
have
bought
it,
that
you
want
to
hold
the
united
states
to
at
least
as
high
a
standard
as
the
states.
but
apparently,
it
was
never
made
to
them.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
therefore,
you
would
require
an
affirmative
authorization
in
the
constitution
to
allow
the
united
states
to
disavow
one
of
its
contracts
rather
than
vice
versa?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
weren't
those
cases,
mr.
hurwitz,
in
which
congress
had
not
specifically
provided
to
the
contrary?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
then
congress
comes
along
in
1983
and
says,
we
now
wish
this
contract
repudiated.
