justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
willard,
are
there
any
other
public
assistance
programs
subject
to
agreements
like
the
418
agreement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
hurwitz,
if...
you
don't
concede,
but
i
gather
you
assume
that
congress
could
have
forced
the
states
into
the
social
security
system?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'd
like
to
say
what's
the
difference,
if
it
now
prohibits
states
from
withdrawing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
that
suggest,
mr.
hurwitz,
that
this
is
really
just
a
contract--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--well,
if
it's
just
a
contract
action,
why
do
you
need
to
rely
on
the
takings
clause?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
what
case
have
we
said
a
contract
right
was
a
property
right?
