was
that
because
of
the
tenth
amendment
jurisprudence?
justice

do
you
think
that
congress
could
have
mandated
coverage
of
only
the
state
and
local
employees
who
were
already
covered?
could
it
have
done
that,
by
legislation?
justice
sandra

o'connor
well,
mr.
hurwitz,
it
seems
to
me
the
weakness
of
the
argument
is
in
not
recognizing
the
possibility
that
the
contract
itself
reserved
the
right
to
the
federal
government
to
withdraw
by
virtue
of
its
reference
to
the
federal
law,
which
it
made
applicable,
and
the
federal
law
said
provided
for
the
right
of
congress
to
repeal
or
amend
the
act.
and
you
really...
justice
powell
brought
this
to
your
attention
but
it
seems
to
me
you
really
haven't
satisfactorily
answered
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
in
effect
i
think
perhaps
it
did.
