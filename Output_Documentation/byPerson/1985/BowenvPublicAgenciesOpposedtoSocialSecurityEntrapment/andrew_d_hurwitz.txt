mr.
andrew
d.
hurwitz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
case,
in
our
view,
about
whether
the
government
needs
to
keep
its
promises
to
the
states.
it
is
a
case
about
fundamental
fairness
in
state-federal
relationships.
in
1951,
when
this
agreement
was
signed,
california
was
not
required
to
participate
in
the
social
security
system.
it
could
have
chosen,
as
other
states
did,
simply
to
remain
without
the
system.
in
order
to
induce
it
to
participate
in
the
system,
the
united
states
made
california
a
good
offer.
the
offer
was
this:
participate
in
the
system,
remain
for
at
least
five
years,
and
then
you
can
leave
on
proper
notice
if
you
want
to.
caliifornia
accepted
the
offer,
and
they
signed
a
contract
with
the
united
states.
that
contract
is
a
1951
agreement.
california
lived
by
its
word
for
35
years.
now,
when
california
calls
on
the
united
states
to
uphold
its
end
of
the
bargain,
it
is
told
the
promises
are
no
longer
binding.
we
think
that
is
bad
federalism,
but
more
important,
we
think
that's
bad
law,
and
is
not
required
in
this
case.
the
starting
point--
mr.
andrew
d.
hurwitz
--mr.
chief
justice,
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
federal
government
has
given
up
any
sovereign
right.
this
is
a
case
where
the
federal
government
has
simply
given
in
the
contract
to
california
the
right
to
terminate
the
agreement.
once
having
terminated
the
agreement,
california
has
no
special
rights
vis-a-vis
any
other
state.
it
can
thereafter,
if
it
is
legal--
mr.
andrew
d.
hurwitz
--we
will
assume
that
for
purposes
of
this
case,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
andrew
d.
hurwitz
we're
spending
all
the
time
on
this
for
two
reasons.
first,
the
contract
at
issue
gave
california
the
right
to
withdraw
from
the
system.
once
outside
the
system,
assuming
that
mandatory
coverage
is
allowed,
that
might
be
imposed
on
california.
the
history
of
mandatory
coverage
in
this
country,
the
history
of
the
social
security
act,
is
that
congress
has
never
in
either
1935,
not
in
1950,
not
in
1983,
decided
to
impose
mandatory
coverage.
it
is
possible
that
congress
may
at
some
time
in
the
future
decide
to
do
that.
but
until
it
does,
until
it
makes
that
decision,
the
contract
right
that
california
gained
in
the
1951
agreement
is
quite
important.
i
think
i
can
illustrate--
mr.
andrew
d.
hurwitz
--i
think
not,
justice
o'connor,
and
let
me
tell
you
why.
the
contract
right
that
we
gained
in
this
circumstance
was
the
right
to
leave
the
system,
was
the
right
to
terminate
the
agreement,
no
better,
no
worse.
once
we
got
out
of
the
system,
once
we
got
out
of
the
agreement,
california
could
be
treated
like
any
other
state,
no
better,
no
worse.
but
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
every
bit
as
direct
an
abrogation
of
the
contract
to
pass
a
law
that
only
those
states
that
exercised
their
contract
rights
would
be
subject
to
mandatory
coverage.
that
would
be,
in
the
words
of
the
government,
exacting
form
over
substance.
mr.
andrew
d.
hurwitz
we
do
assume
that,
justice
brennan.
mr.
andrew
d.
hurwitz
justice
brennan,
what
it
has
done
in
this
case
is
not
prohibit
every
state
from
withdrawing
from
the
system.
rather,
what
it
has
not
done
in
this
case
is
impose
the
system
on
every
state.
what
the
united
states
has
done
in
this
case
is
to
say
only
to
those
states
who
trusted
it,
only
to
those
states
who
took
its
word,
only
to
those
states
who
contracted
with
it,
you
must
remain
in
the
system.
those
of
you
who
never
contracted
with
us,
you
may
not,
you
may
not
if
you
want
to.
those
of
you
who
terminated
before
today,
you
may
remain
out.
it
strikes
us
that
that's
a
direct
abrogation
of
the
contract's
expectations,
when
the
state
entered
into
the
contract,
when
it
gained
the
termination
right,
it
felt
that
once
terminated,
it
would
not
be
discriminated
against
for
having
entered
into
the
contract.
mr.
andrew
d.
hurwitz
mr.
justice
brennan,
in
essence
it
is.
what
we
rely
on
today
are
rights
that
we
gained
through
the
contract.
had
there
been
no
contract,
had
there
been
no
agreement
between
the
states--
mr.
andrew
d.
hurwitz
--we
rely
on
the
takings
clause
in
addition
to
making
our
contract
claims,
justice
brennan,
because
contract
rights
are
property
rights
as
this
court
has
pointed
out.
we
would
be
perfectly
content
to
win
as
a
contract
action
or
a
due
process
action.
mr.
andrew
d.
hurwitz
this
court
said
it
most
recently
in
the
monsanto
case,
in
the
case
dealing
with
trade
secrets.
it
said
it
a
long
time
ago
in
lynch,
and
it
has
reiterated
that
point
ever
since.
mr.
andrew
d.
hurwitz
well,
that
would
have
been
rather
difficult.
mr.
andrew
d.
hurwitz
well,
i
suppose
we
could
have
proceeded
in
the
claims
court
under
the
tucker
act
and
sought
compensation,
but
what
we
were
really
claiming
here
was
that
this
was
a
taking,
and
violating
our
constitutional
rights.
mr.
andrew
d.
hurwitz
sir?
mr.
andrew
d.
hurwitz
we
don't
want...
we
asked
for
an
injunction
but
what
we
really
wanted
was
a
declaration.
we
wanted
a
declaration
of
what
congress
and
the
united
states
has
done...
have
done
to
the
1983
amendment
to
the
social
security
act,
was
a
taking.
that
was
what
the
claim
below
was.
mr.
andrew
d.
hurwitz
that's
correct,
justice
powell.
mr.
andrew
d.
hurwitz
justice
powell,
section
1304
allowed
congress
to
amend
a
repeal
to
the
act.
section
1304
did
not
present
to
congress
the
right
to
amend
or
repeal
contracts
entered
into
by
the
government
under
the
act.
indeed,
i
think
one
could
argue
that
this
reserved
right
to
change
the
act
is
one
of
the
motivating
causes
for
the
states
in
1951
and
earlier
to
sign
up
these
agreements
when
they
were
available.
it
may
well
have
been
that
in
future
years
the
congress
could
have
decided
that
termination
rights
could
not
be
given
in
agreements,
but
in
1951
they
were.
it
is
the
right
not
to
change
the
agreement
that
is
at
issue
here,
not
the
right
to
change
the
act.
we
understood
the
benefit
levels
might
change.
we
understood
that
coverage
might
change.
we
understood
that
many
things
in
the
act
might
change.
we
also
understood
that
we
had
the
contractual
right,
if
those
changes
occur,
to
terminate
our
voluntary
consent
and
then
be
treated
as
if
we
had
never
contracted.
mr.
andrew
d.
hurwitz
they
certainly
did,
justice
powell.
mr.
andrew
d.
hurwitz
no,
we're
not,
justice
powell.
mr.
andrew
d.
hurwitz
we
relied
originally
not
only
on
section
418,
but
moved
on
the
written
contract
which
we
were
given
by
the
united
states,
which
california
signed.
mr.
andrew
d.
hurwitz
that
is
correct,
justice
powell.
the
contract
reflected
the
law
as
it
stood
at
the
time,
as
all
contracts
do.
mr.
andrew
d.
hurwitz
if
it
does
that
with
respect
to
all
the
states,
mr.
chief
justice,
then
we'll
go
back
to
the
district
court,
litigate
our
claims
about
whether
mandatory
coverage
is
permissible.
but
if
it
does
that
with
respect
to--
mr.
andrew
d.
hurwitz
--mr.
chief
justice,
we
have
assumed
that
for
purposes
of
this
case.
the
district
court
did
not
reach
that
issue
because
it
did
not
have
before
it
a
case
where
the
government
exercised
that
sovereign
power.
but
if
that
were
to
occur,
it
seems
to
us
our
claim
would
not
be
on
the
contract.
the
contract
gave
us,
in
mr.
willard's
words,
a
perpetual
right
to
withdraw.
it
did
not
give
us,
however,
a
perpetual
right
to
remain
without
the
system.
we
had
the
right
only
to
withdraw,
and
thereafter
to
be
treated
the
same
as
any
other
state.
if
all
states
were
treated
the
same,
then
we'd
have
a
claim
of
whether
or
not
congress
exceeded
its
power
on
that
treatment,
but
that's
not
the
claim
presented
by
this
case.
i
want
to,
before
i
go
on,
by
the
way,
to
respond
to
the
question
that
justice
brennan
asked
earlier.
we
are
aware,
and
the
government
points
to
none
in
its
brief,
of
any
other
federal
program
where
the
right
to
terminate
the
state's
participation
is
included
in
the
agreement.
this
is
a
rather
unique
arrangement,
and
we
think
that's
one
of
the
things
that
points
out
why
this
is
the
contract.
in
1950,
when
congress
enables
the
united
states
to
enter
into
the
agreements,
they
were
circumventing
not
only
the
political
and
legal
problems
that
it
perceived
in
mandatory
coverage,
it
gained
something.
it
gained
the
promise
from
the
state
that
it
would
remain
in
the
system
for
five
years,
and
thereafter
terminate
its
participation
only
after
two
years'
notice.
a
typical
federal
grant
program,
a
typical
cooperative
federal-state
program,
allows
the
state
to
decide
every
year
whether
it
wants
to
remain
or
leave.
this
is
a
unique
contract
and
i
have
not
heard
from
the
government
in
any
stage
of
this
litigation
a
suggestion
to
the
contrary.
mr.
andrew
d.
hurwitz
no,
quite
to
the
contrary,
justice
rehnquist.
we
think
the
contract
is
quite
constitutional.
we
think
the
contract
was
drawn
pursuant
to
the
powers
that
the
federal
government
had
at
the
time,
and
we
think
that
the
federal
government
is
required
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
to
adhere
to
this
contract.
mr.
andrew
d.
hurwitz
that's
correct,
the
contracts
clause
is
not
applicable
to
the
federal
government,
although
we
do
think
that
there's
an
analog
in
the
due
process
clause
that
would
require
the
federal
government
also
to
live
up
to
its
contracts.
mr.
andrew
d.
hurwitz
this
case...
this
court
in
the
thorpe
case
indicated
that
for
practical
purposes
the
due
process
clause
could
be
viewed
as
the
federal
equivalent
of
the
contracts
clause.
with
respect
to
the
appellees
who
are
not
in
the
state
of
california,
the
state
and
local
subdivisions,
we
think
their
due
process
rights,
their
rights
to
have
the
federal
government
obey
a
contract,
have
also
been
violated
in
this
case.
mr.
andrew
d.
hurwitz
thorpe
was
not
a
holding
to
that
effect,
but
the
language
in
thorpe
on
that
point,
i
think,
is
quite
clear.
nonetheless,
justice
rehnquist,
we
think
we
can
prevail
without
resort
to
the
due
process
clause.
we
think
it
is
the
takings
clause
which
should
govern
in
this
case.
mr.
andrew
d.
hurwitz
i
think,
your
honor...
let
me
tell
you
why,
by
way
of
an
example.
this
court
held
a
long
time
ago
in
the
stone
versus
mississippi
case
that
a
state
could,
if
it
wanted
to,
pass
a
law
outlawing
lotteries,
even
if
it
had
given
a
lottery
contract
to
an
individual.
i
would
not
think
that
anyone
would
today
contend
that
the
lottery
contract
with
the
state
is
worthless,
because
the
state
in
the
exercise
of
its
sovereign
power
might
someday
decide
to
set
up
a
different
system.
in
this
case
we've
got
a
contract
right.
congress
might
conceivably
in
the
exercise
of
its
sovereign
power
someday
render
that
right
worth
less
than
it
is
today,
but
congress
has
not
chosen
to
do
so.
congress
has
expressly,
on
at
least
three
occasions,
considered
the
issue
of
mandatory
coverage
and
decided
that
was
not
something
it
wanted
to
do.
we
are
willing
to
take
our
risks
within
the
congressional
system.
it
seems
to
me
that
is
what
garcia
is
about.
it
allows
the
states
through
the
exercise
of
their
representation
in
the
congress,
through
the
exercise
of
their
political
representation,
to
face
the
risks
that
anyone
might
face,
of
general
legislation.
but
it
doesn't
mean
that
our
contract
right
is
worthless
because
someday,
in
a
hypothetical
case,
congress
might
decide
to
do
something
different.
we
have
been
accused
in
this
case
of
arguing
form
over
substance.
i
want
to
make
plain
that
we
are
not
arguing
form
over
substance.
as
i
indicated
to
an
earlier
question,
we
think
that
any
act
which
did
what
this
act
did,
and
only
what
this
act
did,
would
appropriate
our
contract
rights,
would
constitute
a
taking.
and,
we
think
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
if
congress
could
have
in
some
other
way
had
the
same
effect
on
us,
because
congress
has
not
chosen
to
do
so.
mr.
andrew
d.
hurwitz
i
am,
your
honor,
and
i
am
also
representing
the
other
appellees.
mr.
andrew
d.
hurwitz
your
honor,
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
be
asked
by
the
parties
to
appear
today,
and
i
am
grateful
for
that
opportunity.
mr.
andrew
d.
hurwitz
the
state
is
a
party,
your
honor.
it
was
a
plaintiff
in
the
court
below.
mr.
andrew
d.
hurwitz
i
hope
not,
your
honor.
i
would
have
thought
that
under
the
circumstances
the
principle
would
have
been
exactly
the
same,
which
is
that
when
a
contract
is
entered
into...
in
the
dodge
case,
for
example,
as
i
read
this
court's
holding,
it
was
that
one
simply
did
not
read
a
statutory
scheme
as
a
contract.
the
sovereign,
the
state
government,
the
federal
government
always
has
the
ability
through
eminent
domain
to
take
contract
rights
and
to
pay
for
them.
in
the
dodge
case
what
we
had
was
an
adjustment
of
rights
between
third
parties,
not
between
the
state,
not
between
the
contracting
party,
not
between
the
federal
government
and
the
party
that
had
relied
on
its
word.
so,
i
think
those
cases
would
come
out
the
same
way
under
any
sort
of
argument.
mr.
andrew
d.
hurwitz
dodge
was
a
case,
as
i
recall,
justice
rehnquist,
between
an
employee
and
the
board
of
education.
the
state
had
passed
a
law
which
readjusted
the
rights
between
employees
and
the
board
of
education
because
it
dealt
with
retirement
benefits
and
other
benefits.
mr.
andrew
d.
hurwitz
oh,
no,
quite
to
the
contrary.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
there
is
a
more
compelling
case
for
holding
the
government
to
its
bargain
when
the
government
is
a
contracting
party.
in
that
case
the
issue
is
whether
a
general
act
by
the
state
legislature,
which
had
an
incidental
effect
on
a
contract
to
which
a
governmental
agency
also
happened
to
be
a
party,
violated
the
contract
clause.
mr.
andrew
d.
hurwitz
they
are,
justice
rehnquist,
but
in
that
case
the
challenge
was
to
the
act.
the
challenge
was
not
to
a
breach
of
contract
by
the
board
of
education.
this
is
a
case
where
the
breach,
it
seems
to
me,
is
much
more
direct.
the
breach
is
by
the
congress,
by
the
united
states,
as
a
contracting
party.
the
government's
chief
allegation
in
this
case
seems
to
be
that
even
if
this
is
a
contract,
even
if
we
did
gain
a
contract
right,
it
doesn't
matter
because
the
united
states
is
a
sovereign.
we
know
of
no
decision
of
this
court
which
indicates
that
the
right
to
breach
of
contract
is
an
attribute
of
sovereignty.
indeed,
the
decisions
of
this
court
are
quite
to
the
contrary.
but
more
important,
that
argument
just
doesn't
hold
water
when
analyzed.
it
was
the
government
who
chose
to
put
the
contract
clause
in
this
contract.
mr.
andrew
d.
hurwitz
it
may
well
be
under
those
circumstances,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
contract
would
be
invalid
ab
initio.
mr.
andrew
d.
hurwitz
i
would
think
under
these
circumstances,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
would
have
to
strike
the
whole
contract.
california
entered
into
this
agreement
understanding
that
it
got
various
benefits
thereby.
it
not
only
got
social
security
coverage
for
its
employees,
but
it
also
got
the
right
to
terminate.
but
the
united
states
is
now
saying,
well,
we
only
meant
to
offer
half
of
those
benefits.
we
didn't
mean
to
offer
you
everything
you
thought
you
got
in
that
contract,
and
california
ought
to
have
the
opportunity
to
say,
well,
maybe
we
didn't
mean
to
enter
into
it.
the
important
point,
i
think,
is
this.
it
was
the
united
states
which
chose
to
use
the
vehicle
of
contracting.
it
was
the
united
states
which
thought
there
were
benefits
from
using
the
contract.
the
united
states
need
not
use
contracts
in
the
future
if
it
feels
that
it
is
bound
somehow
by
them
to
a
result
that
it
doesn't
want
to
go
to.
the
united
states
may,
if
it
wants
to,
and
wants
to
pay
just
compensation,
use
the
takings
power,
use
the
eminent
domain
power
to
appropriate
contract
rights
for
its
benefit.
but,
what
the
united
states
may
not
do,
what
the
lynch
case
teaches,
what
the
perry
case
teaches,
even
the
sinking
fund
case
teaches,
the
united
states
may
not
simply
walk
away
from
its
contract
obligation
because
that
happens
to
be
a
circumstance
that
is
particularly
beneficial
to
it
in
a
situation.
mr.
andrew
d.
hurwitz
i
do,
your
honor,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
when
one
looks
at
lynch,
which
is
a
circumstance
where
the
government
was
acting
again
under
the
taxing
and
spending
power,
as
it
is
in
this
case,
and
one
looks
at
the
darlington
case,
particularly
justice
harland's
dissent,
the
message
seems
to
be
clear
that
the
government
is
bound
by
its
agreements.
in
that
particular
circumstance
the
agreement
it
was
bound
by
dealt
with
the
spending
power.
it
dealt
with
the
power
to
raise
money.
but
that's...
i
don't
think
the
principle
is
limited
to
those
circumstances.
i
think
the
principle
extends
to
any
circumstance
where
the
government
enters
into
a
contract.
mr.
andrew
d.
hurwitz
i
think
that's
right,
justice
rehnquist.
congress
can
have
no
power
greater,
it
seems
to
me,
than
the
executive
to
abrogate
a
contract.
mr.
andrew
d.
hurwitz
justice
rehnquist,
we
in
our
brief...
and
i
would
argue
today
that
congress
is
entitled
under
certain
circumstances,
under
certain
limited
circumstances,
to
abrogate
contracts.
it
seems
to
us
that
is
the
message
of
the
u.s.
trust
case.
but
it
may
do
so
only--
mr.
andrew
d.
hurwitz
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
d.
hurwitz
that's
correct.
and
one
might
argue,
the
broadest
possible
argument
is
that
the
federal
government
simply
has
no
power
whatsoever
to
abrogate
contracts.
but
because
it
has
the
power
to
give
just
compensation,
because
it
has
the
power
of
eminent
domain,
that
it
must
abide
by
its
contracts
like
everyone
else.
but
it
seems
to
us
that
the
least
standard
that
you
can
hold
the
government
to
is
the
standard
of
the
u.s.
trust
case
which
is
what
we
have
held
the
states
to.
when
they
have
breached
their
own
contracts,
when
they
breach
a
contract--
mr.
andrew
d.
hurwitz
--i
agree,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
andrew
d.
hurwitz
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
that
that
case
indicates
that's
the
least
standard
that
the
federal
government
can
be
held
to.
i'm
aware
of
no
case
in
this
court--
mr.
andrew
d.
hurwitz
--i
absolutely
agree,
justice
rehnquist.
and
what
we
are
arguing
by
analogy
is
that
if
the
states
are
allowed
to
withdraw
from
their
own
contracts,
only
on
what
this
court
essentially
called
compelling
circumstances,
that
there
should
be
no
less--
mr.
andrew
d.
hurwitz
--justice
rehnquist,
i
assume
that's
correct.
on
the
other
hand
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
which
apparently
allows
the
united
states
government,
once
having
entered
into
a
contract,
to
walk
away
from
it.
mr.
andrew
d.
hurwitz
no,
i
think
there
is
a
prohibition,
justice
rehnquist,
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
walking
away
from
its
contract,
and
that
prohibition
is
in
the
takins
clause
because
this
court
has
recognized
time
and
again
that
contractual
rights
and
other
intangibles
are
property
rights.
mr.
andrew
d.
hurwitz
justice
o'connor,
let
me
take
another
shot
at
it
and
see
if
i
can...
the
contract
contained
the
clause,
an
explicit
clause
allowing
the
state
to
withdraw
from
the
agreement.
every
contract,
not
only
this
one
but
every
contract
ever
made
to
by
any
party,
incorporates
in
it
the
law
that
was
existing
at
the
time.
there
is
no
need
for
the
united
states
in
this
contract
to
mention
the
right
to
terminate
the
agreement,
if
in
fact
that
right
was
solely
dependent
on
whatever
law
existed
at
the
time.
the
united
states
did
something
more.
it
not
only
told
us
that
there
was
a
statute
that
allowed
withdrawal
but
it
put
it
in
writing.
it
told
us
at
the
time
that
if
we
wanted
to
withdraw,
sign
up
the
agreement
and
we'll
gain
that
right.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
right
to
change
the
statute
without
eventually
changing
the
statutory
scheme
does
not
mean...
and
the
sinking
fund
cases
i
think
expressly
go
to
this
point...
does
not
mean
that
the
government
can
retroactively
change
a
contract
that
it
has
entered
into
under
that
statute.
that
contract
is
binding.
going
back
to
the
chief
justice's
point,
it
seems
to
me
important
that
there
was
another
way
for
the
government
to
do
it.
the
government
could
have,
we're
assuming
for
purposes
of
this
case,
imposed
mandatory
coverage
on
all
the
states.
it
could
have
included
everybody
within
the
system.
it
didn't
choose
to
do
so
for
good
legal
and
perhaps
political
reasons.
not
having
chosen
to
do
so,
it
seems
to
me,
it
cannot
go
back
to
the
contract
now
and
say,
well,
we
could
have
changed
the
contract
in
any
event.
i
don't
think
the
right
to
change
the
contract
was
reserved,
and
the
united
states
could
have,
in
drawing
up
the
contract,
put
that
into
the
contract.
it
could
have
said,
you'll
have
no
termination
right.
it
could
have
said,
your
termination
right
will
be
changed,
perhaps
without
notice.
mr.
andrew
d.
hurwitz
justice
o'connor,
i
think
that's
a
view
of
the
case
we
just
simply
don't
share.
the
contract
is
separate
from
the
statute,
and
in
this
case
the
contract
was
not
changed.
it
was
the
statute
that
was
changed.
i
think
it's
important
also
to
view
this
case
a
little
bit
in
the
light
of
federalism.
there
are,
as
justice
brennan
pointed
out
earlier,
any
number
of
cooperative
programs
between
the
state
and
federal
government.
this
court
has
in
the
context
of
grant
programs,
entitled
grant
programs,
applied
general
contract
principles
to
those
programs.
it
has
said
the
federal
government
is
bound
by
its
word
and
the
states
are
bound
by
their
words.
mr.
andrew
d.
hurwitz
that's
correct,
justice
rehnquist,
because
those
were
cases
in
which
the
contract
was
in
effect
defined
by
the
statute.
we
have
a
case
here
where
the
contract
is
defined
by
the
1951
agreement.
mr.
andrew
d.
hurwitz
once
having
entered
into
that
contract,
justice
rehnquist,
we
think
congress
has
no
greater
ability
to
repudiate
the
contract
than
the
executive
would
have
had.
the
constitution
in
the
takings
clause,
the
constitution
to
the
extent
the
due
process
clause
is
applicable,
would
seem
to
us
to
apply
equally
to
legislative
takings
as
to
administrative
takings,
and
in
this
case
what
we
have
is
a
legislative
taking.
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
cooperative
federalism,
the
important
point,
i
think,
is
this:
that
under
all
these
programs,
under
all
the
programs
with
which
the
court
is
familiar,
it
is
important
that
the
states
be
able
to
take
the
federal
government
at
its
word.
it
is
important
that
the
states
be
allowed
to
trust
the
federal
government,
and
the
federal
government
in
return
must
be
able
to
rely
on
the
states
entering
into
these
agreements
to
administer
programs.
if
the
court
today
holds
that
the
federal
government
is
not
bound
by
its
word,
or
that
the
states
are,
the
effect
on
the
system
of
cooperative
federalism,
we
think,
would
be
devastating.
as
i
said
at
the
outset,
we
think
that
would
be
bad
federalism.
more
important,
we
think
it
would
be
bad
law.
it
would
be
bad
constitutional
law
and
it
would
be
a
repudiation
of
this
court's
prior
decisions
that
this
court
is
bound
by
its
undertakings.
for
that
reason,
we
think
that
this
court
should
affirm
the
judgment
below.
thank
you.
