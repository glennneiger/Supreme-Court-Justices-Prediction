mr.
willard,
could
that
have
been
the
first
instance
that
caused
this
burden
on
the
employees
of
california
and
no
other
state,
for
example?
because
as
i
understand
it,
the
states
that
got
out
in
time
are
out,
aren't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
to
the
extent
that
you
rely
on
the
fact
that
we
might
have
written
the
statute
that
accomplishes
this
result,
my
question
is,
could
you
have
written
a
statute
that
applied
to
45
states
but
not
50?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
they
had
made
it
known
early
enough
that
they
didn't
want
to
be
part
of
it,
that's
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
hurwitz,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
that?
we
have
talked
a
little
bit
about
the
hypothetical
of
not
all
states
being
subject...
i
mean,
all
states
weren't
in
the...
had
the
contract
right.
but
for
purposes
of
analyzing
the
takings
issue,
would
it
not
be
precisely
the
same
issue
if
all
50
states
were
in
exactly
the
same
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
would
the
constitutional
issue
be
any
different
if
congress
did
no
more
than
accept
this
over
the
system?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
i
think
you
would
make
the
same
argument,
they
could
get
a
better
bargain
elsewhere?
