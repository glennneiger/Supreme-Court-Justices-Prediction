mr.
john
b.
huffaker
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
way
this
case
started,
the
question
was
whether
income
from
the
advertisements
in
the
scholarly
journal
of
the
american
college
of
physicians,
organized
for
charitable
purposes,
is
subject
to
the
unrelated
business
income
tax
where
the
advertisement
relates
solely
to
the
practice
of
internal
medicine,
are
uniquely
informative
and
are
indisputably
shown
to
contribute
importantly
to
its
exempt
function.
in
this
court
the
question
is
narrower.
in
this
court
the
government
is
arguing
that
the
college
is
precluded
by
a
conclusive
presumption
with
no
foundation
in
the
code,
the
regulations
or
the
legislative
history
from
showing
as
a
factual
matter
that
its
advertising
activity
contributes
importantly
to
the
exempt
function.
the
court
of
appeals
heard
this
as
a
factual
case.
now,
in
determining
it
we
have
a
certain
amount
of
confusion
because
of
the
name
of
the
taxpayer,
american
college
of
physicians,
as
justice
blackmun
understood,
is
quite
old.
the
more
modern
term
is
internist,
and
you
will
find
that
in
the
literature
they
are
used
interchangeably.
now,
an
internist
is
a
medical
doctor
who
treats
the
bodily
ailments
without
surgery,
largely,
frequently,
by
the
use
of
drugs.
now,
when
we
look
to
the
code
we
see
that
the
key
relationship
in
the
statute
is,
does
the
activity
contribute
importantly
to
the
exempt
function.
mr.
john
b.
huffaker
yes,
justice.
mr.
john
b.
huffaker
we
find...
we
argued
that
judge
kozinsky
made
a
very
fundamental
error
of
fact
and
he
was
overruled
by
the
court
of
claims
as
clearly
erroneous
on
that
ground,
but
judge
kozinsky
decided
a
fact
question
and
he
was
reversed
on
a
fact
question.
mr.
john
b.
huffaker
that's
correct.
mr.
john
b.
huffaker
that's
correct.
may
i
explain
why
they
were
clearly
erroneous,
and
why
the
statement
of
the
petitioner
about
the
nature
of
the
advertising
is
misleading.
the
benefit
is
not
incidental.
the
charitable
organization
that
we're
concerned
with
here
is
organized
for
the
promotion
of
health
care
by
internists.
it
conducts
a
broad
range
of
programs
for
the
advancement
of
health
care,
some
going
to
the
concerns
of
training
of
internists,
others
to
helping
the
continuing
education
of
the
internists
so
that
they
can
better
deliver
patient
care.
dr.
moser,
the
executive
director
testified,
the
primary
function
of
the
college
is
medical
education
of
internists
with
the
ultimate
bottom-line
hope
that
this
will
provide
better
patient
care
through
the
efforts
of
these
internists.
the
exempt
organization
handbook
of
the
irs
recognizes
that
the
promotion
of
health
care
is
one
of
the
classic
functions
of
a
charitable
organization.
it's
not
new.
it's
one
of
the
most
classic
types
of
charitable
organizations.
now,
the
annals
is
the
chief
publication
that
goes
to
the
problem
of...
or
function
of
delivering
health
care.
the
annals
has
two
parts,
the
scholarly
articles
which
push
forward
the
boundaries
of
medical
knowledge.
but
then
it
has
the
advertising
activity,
and
the
advertising
activity
fulfills
a
very
real
function.
the
advertising
activity
serves
to...
remember
it's
about
80
percent
of
drugs,
80
percent
pharmaceuticals.
the
others
comprise
the
other...
but
they're
all
related
to
the
practice
of
internal
medicine.
mr.
john
b.
huffaker
my
position
would
be,
impossible,
your
honor.
it
is
the
ads
on
the
drugs
that
advance,
that
can
give
the
physician
the
knowledge
he
needs.
remember,
the
physician,
when
the
patient
comes
in,
it
is
the
duty
of
the
doctor
to
evaluate
his
ailment.
after
evaluating
his
ailment
he
prescribes.
i
think
it
was
very,
very
well
said
by
the
fifth
circuit
in
reyes
versus
wyeth
laboratories
which
we
cite,
as
a
medical
expert
the
prescribing
physician
can
take
into
account
the
propensities
of
the
drug
as
well
as
the
susceptibilities
of
his
patient.
his
is
the
task
of
weighing
the
benefits
of
any
medication
against
its
potential
dangers.
the
choice
he
makes
is
an
informed
one,
an
individualized
medical
judgment,
bottomed
on
a
knowledge
of
both
patient
and
palliative.
mr.
john
b.
huffaker
if
no
charge
was
made
for
the
ads,
or
put
it
more
realistically,
if
the
ads
were
merely
self-supporting
or
no
charge
was
made,
i
think...
the
college
has
limited
resources.
the
profit
that
is
made
from
running
the
ads
helps
support
these
other
programs
that
are
all
in
the
public
interest
but
which
are
not
self-supporting.
the
fact
that
the
charge
is
there
doesn't
detract
from
the
fact
that
these
ads
are
giving
the
internist
the
essential
knowledge
that
he
needs
to
prescribe.
now,
he's
not
going
to
read
an
ad--
mr.
john
b.
huffaker
--yes,
sir.
mr.
john
b.
huffaker
the
organization
is...
maybe
the
bill
is
a
little
smaller
if
he
gets
to
the
root
of
the
evil
a
little
quicker,
and
maybe
you
feel
better
a
little
quicker
for
the
fact
that
he
is
treating
you
and
being
well
informed
rather
than
a
little
bit
behind.
the
ads
serve
three
purposes.
mr.
john
b.
huffaker
he
pays
for
his
subscription
to
the
magazine,
either
through
dues
or
subscription.
the
magazine
is
not
handed
out
free.
it's
the
college
that's
the
exempt
organization,
not
the
doctor.
mr.
john
b.
huffaker
they're
in
business
for
your
health.
mr.
john
b.
huffaker
the
prescribing
physician
is
the
learned
intermediary
between
the
manufacturer
and
the
consumer.
now,
the
advertisements
come
in
and
we
have
four
distinguished
witnesses,
the
executive
director,
the
former
executive
director,
the
dean
of
the
medical
school
at
the
university
of
north
carolina,
the
professor
of
pharmacology,
university
of
rochester
medical
school,
all
testified
that
the
advertisements
perform
a
vital
function
in
keeping
the
internist
up
to
date.
the
internist
is
uniquely
dependent
upon
these
ads.
they
tell
him
not
only
about
the
new
drugs,
they
tell
him
about
the
old
drugs,
what
new
bad
things
they
can
do
or
new
good
things
that
they
can
do.
they
remind
him
of
things
that
he
might
have
forgotten.
now,
we
have
one
ad
that--
mr.
john
b.
huffaker
--this
is
not
the
only
source,
but
i
suggest
it
is
a
much
more
efficient
way
to
keep
up,
and
also
that
if
he
saw
every
detail
man
that
came
around,
his
time
for
practicing
medicine
would
have
disappeared
completely.
mr.
john
b.
huffaker
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
b.
huffaker
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
b.
huffaker
about
60,
70
years.
we
had
one
ad
that
got
into
our
brief
in
opposition
to
cert,
sort
of
typical.
we
put
it
in
here
because
the
government
had
put
in
its
brief
the
first
part
of
the
ad
that
was
to
get
attention,
but
the
government
left
out
the
rest
of
the
ad
that
tells
about
what
the
drug
in
question
does.
now,
the
commissioner
of
the
fda
has
written,
has
stated
that
the
entire
ad
is
subject
to
fda
approval
for
overall
impact,
that
these
are
the
most
stringently
regulated
ads
in
all
of
commerce,
there's
the
requirement
that
they
give
equal
attention
to
the
problems
with
the
drug,
as
to
what
the
favorable
aspects.
mr.
john
b.
huffaker
we
think
there
are
two
reasons
why
example
7
has
no
application
in
this--
mr.
john
b.
huffaker
--no,
it
wouldn't,
and
the
reason
it
doesn't
is
that
we
don't
think
the
advertising
that
is
in
the
annals,
the
advertising
of
the
drugs
so
carefully
regulated,
so
fully
provided
pre-publication
censorship,
if
you
please,
by
fda,
that
that's
ordinary
commercial
advertising.
mr.
john
b.
huffaker
if
it...
the
fda
prohibits
this
type
of
advertising.
there's
a
moratorium
on
advertising
of
prescription
drugs
in
general
circulation
magazines,
and
the
reason
is
that
they're
so
susceptible
to
misunderstanding,
they
are
so
incredibly
technical,
the
average--
mr.
john
b.
huffaker
--well,
they
are
making
a
big
point
of
things,
out
of
the
two
or
three
percent
that
the
average
lawyer
can
comprehend.
most
of
it,
remember,
80
percent
of
the
ads
in
round
numbers,
they
agree
that
it's
largely
but
we
count
about
80
percent,
is
prescription
drugs.
so,
the
real
case
here,
the
basic
activity,
is
the
advertising
of
prescription
drugs.
now,
a
few
of
these
others--
mr.
john
b.
huffaker
--that's
what
that
says,
and
remember,
they
go
on
to
something
else.
mr.
john
b.
huffaker
well,
it
is
much
more
narrow
than
that.
it's
much
narrower
than...
our
advertising,
our
advertising,
our
advertising
goes
to
the...
not
just
the
broad
area
of
professional
interest.
it
is
specific
down...
surely
it
is
of
interest
to
the
profession
but
it
is
so
defined
as
to
make
a
major
contribution
to
the
exempt
function.
now,
when
congress
came
in,
let
me
go
back
to
a
point,
there's
a
certain
tension
between
example
7
and
the
general
rule
in
the
regulations.
the
incidental...
the
regulation
says
that
there's
an
incidental
benefit,
that
whatever
educational
value
it
is,
is
incidental.
well,
i
think
the
point
was
made
to
the
justice
a
while
ago,
why
wouldn't
you
publish
them
for
free
if
it
was
necessary.
i
respond,
basically
it's
not
necessary.
but
we
come
back,
the
benefit
here
is
not
just
incidental.
the
problem,
the
benefit
is
that
it
contributes
substantially
to
making
the
internist...
making
it
possible
for
the
internist
to
better
deliver
medical
care.
now,
so
we
have
one
distinction
with
example
7,
which
is
whether
it
relates
to
the
sort,
the
narrow
type
of
drug
advertising
we
have
here.
the
second,
which
is
extremely
important,
in
spite
of
what
petitioner
says,
it
describes
the
organization
there
as
a
business
league,
a
c-6
organization.
he
pretends
that
there's
no
essential
difference,
but
this
court
has
visited
this
question
before,
in
the
better
business
bureau
case
40
years
ago.
this
court
said,
there
is
a
clear
demarcation
for
income
tax
purposes
between
a
c-6
organization
which
is
formed
to
advance
the
business
interest
of
its
members
and
a
c-3
organization
which
is
designed
to
serve
the
public
interest.
professor
bitger,
article
co-authored
by
professor
bitger
in
the
yale
law
review,
distinguishes
them
by
saying
that
the
c-3
is
a
public
benefit
organization.
the
c-6
is,
among
other
groups,
a
mutual
benefit
organization.
in
national
muffler
the
court
by
justice
blackmun
examined
it
and
said,
the
exempt
function
of
the
c-6
is
to
advance
the
common
business
interest
of
the
members.
in
this
instance
the
advertising,
when
it
reaches
dr.
jones
and
serves
to
alert
him
when
he
is
trying
to
prescribe
for
mr.
smith,
it
serves
to
alert
him
to
a
possible
palliative
that
he
might
not
have
known
about,
might
have
forgotten.
it
tends
to
serve
the
exempt
function
by
making
him
more
effective.
that's
a
very
vital
function,
and
remember,
the
tax
isn't
on
every
business
that's
conducted
by
a
charitable
organization.
it's
on
an
unrelated
business.
we
hear
the
words
"unfair
competition",
but
as
the
court
remarked
in
a
louisiana
credit
association
case,
the
draftsmen
avoided
that
word
like
the
plague.
the
statute
says
that
if
it's
unrelated
it's
taxable,
but
if
it's
substantially
related
to
the
conduct
of
the
exempt
function,
it
is
related.
it
is
exempt.
it
is
not
taxable.
in
the
1969
act,
congress
did
another
balancing
act.
professor
kaplan
in
his
article
in
columbia
law
review
points
out
clearly
that
the
ubit
has
no
consistent
economic
underpinning.
it's
a
bunch
of
political
compromises.
the
hearing,
the
announcement
of
the
hearing,
was
that
should
all
advertising
income
be
taxed.
congress
didn't
say
that
advertising
activity
shall
be
an
unrelated
trade
or
business.
we
have
the
two
exceptions
that
we
know
about
that
petitioner
admitted
to,
and
the
third
one
that
justice
blackmun
pointed
out.
when
congress
came
out
they
said
advertising
in
a
journal
will
be
measured
as
a
separate
activity,
and
the
question
is,
does
that
activity
contribute
to
the
exempt
function.
not
many
advertising
activities
will
meet
this
standard,
but
when
the
house
report
came
out
at
26
it
says,
we
have
taken
this
action
and
under
it
the
tax...
the
advertising
activity
may...
may
be
taxable.
the
word
"may"
fairly
has
a
connotation
of
"may
not".
now,
the
report
goes
ahead
to
say,
well,
ordinarily,
generally,
we
anticipate
that
the
advertising
income
will
be
taxable.
i
quite
agree.
it's
unusual
advertising
activity
that
rises
to
the
dignity
of
contributing
importantly
to
the
exempt
function.
but
in
this
court
the
petitioner
is
arguing
that
we
should
be
precluded
by
a
rule
of
law,
conclusive
presumption,
from
showing
that
our
advertising
activity
does
so
contribute.
the
fact
case
was
tried
below.
they
pretend
surprise,
being
upset
by
a
change.
they
shouldn't
have
been.
in
the
first
american
college
case
which
was
tried
before
the
fragmentation
rule
came
into
the
statute,
we
had
motions,
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment
in
the
court
of
claims.
our
first
position
was,
fragmentation
was
not
valid.
the
journal
was
conceded
to
contribute
the
exempt
function.
qed,
we
win.
the
court
held
for
us.
but
there
was
a
second
line,
that
if
they
held
fragmentation
was
valid,
there
was
a
question
of
fact.
and
chief
justice
kallon,
in
his...
in
the
opinion
of
the
court,
states
that,
we
don't
get
to
this
issue
but
it
is
an
essentially
factual
dispute.
essentially
factual
dispute
is
light
years
away
from
a
conclusive
presumption
that
you're
wrong.
an
essentially
factual
dispute
fairly
says
that
we
have
the
opportunity
to
prove
that
our
activity
did
contribute
to
the
exempt
function.
mr.
john
b.
huffaker
no.
he
did
not
apply
a
rule
of
law.
judge
mozinsky
looked
at
the
facts
and
he
over...
he
completely
overlooked
the
contribution
that
this...
the
information,
the
essential
nature
of
the
information
conveyed
in
the
annals,
the
advertising
activity
in
the
annals,
to
the
readers
in
the
practice
of
their
profession.
he
treated
that
as
incidental.
i
think
the
testimony
of
record
at
a
hearing
before
witnesses,
the
record
clearly
shows
and
unanimously
satisfied
the
court
of
appeals
that
this
activity
contributed
importantly.
it
was
tried
in
the
trial
court
as
a
factual
case.
it
was
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals
as
a
fact
case.
we
never
argued
that
the
regulations
were
invalid.
we
never
get
there.
a
c-6
is
so
wildly
different
from
a
c-3.
now,
when
a
case
comes
up
involving
a
c-6
there
will
be
an
opportunity
to
decide
the
vitality
of
example
7.
judge
smith
didn't
comment
on
it
in
his
opinion,
and
it's
no
wonder.
mr.
john
b.
huffaker
the
brief
of
the
commissioner
doesn't
cite
any
of
those
that
i
can
recall.
when
we
went
through
it
to
find
out
where...
the
one
that
we
find
was
issued
in
december
1983,
which
is
pretty
recent,
and
that
was
technical
advice
issued
to
the
american
academy
for
the
advancement
of
science
which
is
cited
in
their
amicus
brief.
we
see
no
clearly
established
administrative
policy
of
applying
example
7
to
c-3
organizations.
we
see
nothing
to
foreclose
us
from
the
factual
burden
that
we
carried.
we
had
a
challenge.
we
had
a
challenge,
and
we
met
it.
the
court
of
appeals
found
we
met
it.
now,
it's
interesting
that
the
government
in
its
brief
at
pages
3,
8
and
9,
the
court
of
appeals,
conceded
that
this
was
a
factual
case.
it's
only
now
and
in
this
court
that
they
say
that
everything
we
were
doing
about
proving
our
case
was
irrelevant.
there
were
no
motions
for
summary
judgment
in
the
trial
court.
there's
this
concession
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
it's
a
fact
case.
now
they
want
to
say
that
there's
a
rule
of
law.
they
find
that
rule
of
law
in
the
oddest
place.
it's
buried
under
another
name,
c-6,
which
has
a
very
different
exempt
purpose.
now,
they
make
much
of
the
fact
that
an
association
can
be
c-3
or
can
be
c-6.
a
c-3
is
organized
and
operated
exclusively
for
charitable
purposes.
one
substantial
non-charitable
purpose
and
you're
not
a
c-3.
national
muffler,
taxation
with
representation,
or
all
cases,
better
business
bureau...
not
national
muffler,
better
business
bureau,
are
cases
in
which
organizations
somewhat
like
c-3's
wanted
to
be
treated
like
c-3's.
the
court
denied
it.
the
government
has
asked
this
court
to
rewrite
the
statute,
to
rewrite
its
own
regulations,
to
find
a
test
that
simply
isn't
there.
we
have
a
facts
and
circumstances
test.
we
met
it.
mr.
john
b.
huffaker
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
b.
huffaker
i
think
we
argued
and
pointed
out
that
it
was
a
third
cousin
of
the
issue,
and
third
cousins
don't
have
to
be
invited
to
the
table.
mr.
john
b.
huffaker
they
just
leave
them
out.
mr.
john
b.
huffaker
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
mr.
john
b.
huffaker
--if
it's
a
first--
mr.
john
b.
huffaker
--a
c-3
organization
simply
isn't
that
close
to
a
c-6,
in
the
first
place.
the
purpose
is
different.
mr.
john
b.
huffaker
well,
not
on
that,
because
secondly...
the
second
issue
is
whether
the
advertising
is
the
sort
of
advertising
described
in
example
7.
we
say
there
are
two
important
distinctions.
the
first
one
is
obvious
on
the
face.
the
second
one
becomes
obvious
after
you
examine
the
material
and
the
background,
the
whole
background
in
which
the
medical
advertising
of
drugs
exists.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
thank
the
court.
