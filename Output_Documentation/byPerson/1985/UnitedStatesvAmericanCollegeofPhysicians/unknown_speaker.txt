unknown
speaker
but
he
charges
for
that
too,
doesn't
he?
unknown
speaker
i
have
great
difficulty...
i
can
conceive
of
your
organization
being
educational
and
i
know
this
is
water
over
the
dam,
but
i've
always
had
trouble
finding
out
how
it
becomes
charitable.
that
comes
out
every
time
i
get
a
bill
from
the
doctor.
unknown
speaker
well,
what's
wrong
with
him
taking
a
portion
of
my
bill
and
paying
for
the
ad?
you're
not
going
to
say
he
doesn't
have
the
money.
unknown
speaker
he
doesn't
really
pay.
the
patient
pays.
i
know
there
are
very
few
doctors
in
business
for
their
health.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know.
that's
my
problem.
is
it
my
health
or
my
money?
unknown
speaker
now,
doesn't
he
get
all
that
from
the
pharmacy
house's
detail
men
that
are
at
his
door
constantly?
unknown
speaker
that's
true.
mr.
huffaker,
let
me
ask,
the
college
has
its
own
building
in
philadelphia,
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
with
a
very
extensive
medical
library?
unknown
speaker
it
has
been
there
a
long
time?
unknown
speaker
mr.
huffaker,
are
you
basically...
your
argument
is
still
describing
a
publication
that
would
meet
example
7,
i
think.
i
appreciate
the
fact
that
it's
incorporated
under
a
different
section
of
the
code,
but
are
you
taking
the
position
that
your
publication
does
or
does
not
fit
example
7
insofar
as
the
content
of
the
publication
is
concerned?
unknown
speaker
that's
not
my
question.
my
question
is,
if
it
does
have
application,
just
assume...
i
know
you
argued
to
the
contrary,
would
your
publication
be
of
the
same
character
as
the
publication
described
in
the
example?
unknown
speaker
well,
wouldn't
these
products
be
subject
to
the
same
controls
if
they're
published
in
non-medical
publications?
say,
the
same
product...
this
is
the
ad
you
called
our
attention
to,
say
was
published
in
the
new
york
times.
wouldn't
it
still
have
to
meet
the
fda
standards?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
all
your
advertising
isn't
of
that
kind.
support
hose,
for
example,
i
notice
they
make
a
big
point
of.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
using
the
language
of
example
7,
they
are
therefore
products
which
are
within
the
general
area
of
professional
interest
of
the
members
of
the
organization,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
true
of
your
publication's
advertising?
all
of
it
is
within
the
general
area
of
professional
interest
of
the
members?
unknown
speaker
mr.
huffaker,
i'm
a
little
puzzled.
maybe
you
answered
this
to
justice
o'connor
earlier,
but
do
you
think
that
judge
kozinsky
applied
a
rule
of
law
that
deprived
you
of
an
opportunity
to--
unknown
speaker
--but
the
government
says
that
the
commissioner
has
applied
regulation
not
only
to
the
class
for
which
it
was
drafted,
but
to
the
class
you're
in,
and
that
is
entitled
to
some
deference.
unknown
speaker
mr.
huffaker,
did
the
government
rely
on
example
7
in
the
federal
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
and
that
court
never
really
discussed
it,
did
they?
unknown
speaker
they
don't
even
have
to
explain
to
them
why
they're
not
invited,
i
guess?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
we
think
it's
a
first
cousin?
what
are
we
supposed
to
do?
unknown
speaker
suppose
that
we
think
it's
very
much
at
issue
here,
example
c-3
organization
is
close
enough
to
a
c-6
that
it
has
great
relevance.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
we
disagree
with
you,
you
lose,
it's
that--
unknown
speaker
it's
hard
to
know
what
the
court
did
really,
because
it
said
it
found
the
findings
clearly
erroneous.
unknown
speaker
is
the
argument
you're
making
here
the
same
that
you
made
before?
unknown
speaker
and
if
it
is...
it's
just
not
open
to
show
that
it's
substantially
related?
unknown
speaker
and
your
claim
below
was
that
there
should...
that
that
kind
of
an
issue
just
wasn't
open?
unknown
speaker
and
did
judge
kozinsky
agree
with
you?
unknown
speaker
and
that
there
was
no
issue
about...
could
be
no
issue
about
substantial
relationship?
unknown
speaker
what
did
ca
fed.
say?
unknown
speaker
so,
did
the
court...
the
court
jut
disagreed
that
this
was
commercial
advertising,
or
not?
unknown
speaker
that
it
was,
but
it
was
what,
substantially
related?
unknown
speaker
and
hence,
importantly
related?
