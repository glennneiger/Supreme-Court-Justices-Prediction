justice
rehnquist
i
take
it
your
earlier
point
was
that
congress
did
not
want
to
subsidize
nonprofit
organizations
in
competing
against
for-profit
organizations
in
a
business?
justice
rehnquist
well,
now
is
this
the
house
report
that
a
company...
some
substitute
of
legislation?
justice
rehnquist
well,
how
much
stronger
do
you
think
the
government's
position
is
in
view
of
these
hearings
and
reports
than
it
would
be
if
you
simply
had
to
justify
the
'67
regs
on
the
basis
of
the
statutes
as
they
then
stood?
