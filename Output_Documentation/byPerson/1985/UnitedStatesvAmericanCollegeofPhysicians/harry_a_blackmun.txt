justice
blackmun
now,
however,
the
american
college
of
physicians
has
been
around
a
long
time,
hasn't
it?
justice
blackmun
well,
i'm
not
sure,
but
i
think
this
one
might
even
precede
that.
and,
well...
okay.
justice
blackmun
mr.
lauber,
let
me
follow
through
on
justice
o'connor's
first
question.
there
is
outstanding
still
a
revenue
ruling
having
to
do
with
bar
association
journals.
i
think
that's
rev.
rule
82,
139,
in
which
the
tax
authorities
made
an
allocation
between
substantially
related
income
and
income
that
wasn't
substantially
related.
how
does
that
square
with
your
pressing
for
an
absolute
ruling?
justice
blackmun
well,
at
issue
there,
in
part
anyway,
were
legal
notices
in
the
revenue
ruling
i'm
speaking
of.
justice
blackmun
that's
against
the
revenue
ruling,
and
what
i
m
leading
up
to
is
that
if
you
should
prevail
here
on
your
general
thesis,
shouldn't
we
just
remand
for
determination
of
which
is
properly
allocable
to,
as
substantially
related
income
and
that
which
is
not?
justice
blackmun
well,
the
revenue
ruling
held
flatly,
ruled
flatly
that
they
were
exempt
from
tax.
justice
blackmun
mr.
lauber,
i
suppose
there
are
instances
where
the
same
ad
is
published
in
the
annals
and
in
the
new
england
journal
of
medicine,
which
is
a
501-c-6
organization,
is
that--
justice
blackmun
--in
which
case,
i
suppose
you're
suggesting
that
there
is
a
slight
element
of
inconsistency
in
the
result?
justice
blackmun
well,
i
suppose
if
the
only
ads
run
are
those
of
medical
economics,
you're
in
a
position
to
be
a
little
more--
justice
blackmun
--one
is
tempted
to
ask
why
you
charge
for
the
ads.
