justice
o'connor
mr.
lauber,
do
you
take
the
position
that
commercial
advertising
can
never
under
any
circumstance
whatever
be
substantially
related
to
or
contribute
importantly
to
a
tax
exempt
organization
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
justice
o'connor
so,
do
you
think
the
regulations
can
amend
the
statute?
justice
o'connor
because
what
i
think
you
are
arguing
for
is
an
absolutely
per
se
rule
which
could
never
be
varied,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
statute
as
far
as
language
is
not
so
phrased?
justice
o'connor
well,
but
congress
didn't
change
the
statute.
it
never
changed
the
language
that
says
that...
that
speaks
in
terms
of
"substantially
related",
or
"contribute
importantly
to
the
purposes
of
the
tax
exempt
organizations.
"
so
i
just
wonder
whether
it's
quite
fair
to
say
there
has
to
be
a
blanket
per
se
rule
and
the
statute
could
never
be
applied
as
it's
written?
justice
o'connor
well,
is
the
critical
factor
in
your
view
that
if
the
advertising
message
is
simply
an
accident
of
the
marketplace,
that
under
these
regulations
it's
taxable?
justice
o'connor
while
i
have
you
interrupted,
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question.
do
you
think
the
issue
of
whether
something
is
substantially
related
to
the
organization's
purpose
is
a
question
of
fact
or
a
question
of
law?
justice
o'connor
you
take
the
position,
mr.
huffaker,
if
i
may
inquire,
that
that
is
purely
a
factual
question?
justice
o'connor
and
in
the
court
of
claims
it
was
determined
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
it
does
not
contribute
importantly?
justice
o'connor
well,
the
court
of
claims
decided
the
case
contrary
to
your
position
today,
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit
reversed,
did
it
not?
justice
o'connor
and
did
they
find
the
findings
were
clearly
erroneous?
