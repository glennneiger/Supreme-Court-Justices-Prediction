mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
here
involves
the
taxability
of
profits
derived
by
an
otherwise
tax-exempt
professional
association
from
the
publication
of
commercial
advertising
in
its
monthly
journal.
the
subset
of
the
tax
world
that
we're
in
here
is
the
unrelated
business
income
for
ubi
tax,
which
congress
enacted
in
1950.
congress
was
spurred
to
enact
that
tax
by
the
now-notorious
acquisition
by
new
york
university
of
the
mueller
macaroni
company.
nyu
had
managed
to
convince
a
federal
court
of
appeals
that
its
spaghetti
profits
should
be
immune
from
tax,
on
the
theory
that
those
profits
were
destined
to
fund
nyu's
educational
activities.
congress
enacted
the
ubi
tax
in
1950
to
insure
that
henceforth
charities
would
pay
tax
on
their
profits
from
such
unrelated
business
ventures.
congress's
main
objective
in
doing
that
was
to
prevent
unfair
competition,
that
is,
to
prevent
a
tax-exempt
group
that
runs
a
business
from
getting
a
competitive
advantage
in
the
form
of
a
tax
subsidy
over
its
taxpaying
competitors
in
the
marketplace.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
for
mueller,
it
was
ronzoni.
here
it's
all
the
mcgraw-hill,
all
the
other
taxpaying
publishers
that
publish
medical
journals
and
pay
tax
on
their
profits.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
they
all
make
profits.
all
the
publishers
of
medical
journals.
some
of
the
tax-exempt--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--it
is
a
non-profit
making
organization.
it's
an
educational
organization
under
section
501.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
it
does,
but
not
for
purposes
of
this
particular
tax
because
an
otherwise
tax-exempt
charity,
if
it
runs
a
business
that's
unrelated
to
its
charitable
purposes,
has
to
pay
tax
on
the
profits
only
from
that
business,
not
from
the
dues
and
so
forth,
but
the
profits
from
that
advertising
business.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
exactly
right.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
a
lot
of
them
have.
ama's
been
around
since
1848,
i
think.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
it's
a
new
tax
on
an
old
organization,
put
it
that
way.
for
this
tax
to
apply,
there'd
have
to
be
three
conditions
met.
there
must
be
a
trade
or
business.
it
must
be
regularly
carried
on,
and
the
conduct
of
a
trade
or
business
must
be
unrelated
to
the
accomplishment
of
the
tax
exempt
purposes
of
the
organization.
now,
the
american
college
here
has
conceded
that
its
publication
of
commercial
advertising
is
a
trade
or
business,
and
that
it
is
regularly
carried
on
by
it.
the
only
question,
therefore,
is
whether
this
advertising
business
is
substantially
related
to
the
accomplishment
of
the
respondent's
educational
purposes.
respondent
contends
that
it
is
related,
on
the
theory
that
the
ads
it
publishes
help
to
educate
the
doctors
who
read
the
magazine.
this
contention
is
based
on
the
fact
that
respondent
does
not
publish
general
consumer
advertising
for
things
like
mercedes
benzes
and
margarine;
rather,
they
advertise
only
products
that
are
of
professional
interest
to
the
doctors
who
read
its
magazine.
these
products
are
mainly
prescription
drugs,
but
also
include
non-prescription
drugs
like
tylenol
and
aspirin,
medical
products
like
support
socks,
and
classified
or
help
wanted
advertisements
for
doctors
in
search
of
employment.
the
question
is
whether
the
publication
of
these
advertisements
is
an
educational
activity.
in
our
view,
the
answer
to
this
question
is
clearly
provided
by
regulations
promulgated
by
treasury
in
1967
to
deal
with
this
varied
commercial
advertising
problem.
example
7
to
those
regulations
describes
a
professional
association
like
respondent,
that
puts
out
a
monthly
professional
journal.
like
respondent,
that
organization
also
avoids
general
consumer
advertising
and
limits
its
ads
to
products
of
professional
interest
to
its
members
in
their
professional
capacity.
nevertheless,
example
7
of
the
regulations
concludes
that
the
publication
of
advertising
designed
and
selected
in
the
manner
of
ordinary
commercial
advertising
is
not
an
educational
activity
of
the
kind
contemplated
by
the
tax
exemption
statute.
example
7
reasons
that
such
commercial
advertising
is
fundamentally
different
from
an
educational
activity,
both
in
its
governing
objective
because
it
aims
not
to
teach
but
to
sell
merchandise,
and
also
in
its
method
because
its
method
is
the
usual
method
of
madison
avenue
which
is
designed
to
put
the
reader
in
a
frame
of
mind
where
he
wants
to
buy
or
to
prescribe
the
advertised
product.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
our
position
is
that
the
test
is
that
in
the
regulation,
advertising
designed
and
selected
in
the
manner--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
the
regulations--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
the
regulation
was
explicitly
approved
by
congress
in
1969.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
as
mentioned
in
our
brief,
jutice
o'connor,
there
are,
one
can
imagine,
examples
of
what
might
be
called
advertisement
being
deemed
related.
for
example,
the
irs
has
ruled
that
a
company
simply
list
its
name
with
a
bunch
of
other
corporate
patrons
for
charitable
endeavor
on
a
page
in
the
magazine.
that
would
not
be
commercial
advertising
because
nothing's
being
advertised.
similarly,
one
can
imagine,
say,
if
there's
been
a
favorable
laboratory
write-up
by
a
scholar
of
a
particular
drug,
and
if
the
drug
company
were
to
have
that
reprinted
in
its
entirety
as
it
originally
was
in
another
magazine,
that
could
be
related,
but
the
regulation
says
that
advertising
designed
and
selected
in
the
manner
of
ordinary
commercial
advertising
is
not
educational,
and
we
think
that
is
a
species
of
a
per
se
rule.
there
can
be
other
kinds
of
advertising
outside
that
are
not
designed
and
selected
in
that
manner.
judge
kozinsky,
for
example,
hypothesized
a
couple
of
ways
a
group
might
be
able
to
run
its
advertising
business
differently,
where
it
had
much
more
input
into
the
editing
and
arrangement
of
the
ads.
conceivably,
that
might
work
but
if
it's
designed--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--that's
a
very
good
point.
that
is
our
position,
and
what
respondent
seized
upon
here
is
this
highly
technical
advertising
designed
for
a
highly
technical
audience,
but
that
is
simply
a
creature
of
the
marketplace.
this
is
drug
advertising
which
is
designed
to
hit
a
particular
market,
and
the
market
is
symmetrical
with
the
people
who
read
this
magazine,
so
it
is
really
a
function
of
the
marketplace,
that
the
advertising
here
takes
the
technical
form
that
it
does.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
normally
it
is
a
question
of
fact,
and
for
the
vast
universe
of
tax-exempt
groups
that
run...
arguably
run
businesses
like
museums,
shops
and
so
forth,
it
is
a
factual
increase.
however,
in
the
particular
case
of
advertising
we
have
a
regulation
which
speaks
directly
to
that,
which
has
given
us
a
narrower
question
to
ask,
and
the
narrower
question
the
regulation
prescribes
is
whether
or
not
the
advertising
is
designed
and
selected
in
the
manner
of
ordinary
commercial
advertising.
it's
a
refinement
of
the
general
factual
test,
which
is
simply...
reduces
the
universe
of
facts
you
need
to
look
at
to
come
up
with
the
correct
answer,
and
congress
expressly
approved
this
regulation
in
1969.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
i
think,
justice
blackmun,
in
the
case
of
the
aba
journal,
i
think...
well,
the
bar
journals,
the
allocation
is
based
on
divvying
up
the
income
between
the
editorial
content
which
is
furnished
through
subscriptions
and
dues,
and
the
advertising.
i
think
all
the
advertising
in
the
aba
journal
is
unrelated
business
income
because
they
advertise
things
like
computers
and
trips
to
bermuda
and
that
kind
of
thing.
it's
clearly
unrelated.
so,
the
allocation
the
ruling
speaks
of
is
allocating
expenses
as
between
the
cost
of
publishing
the
editorial
matter
and
the
cost
incident
to
the
advertising.
you
have
to
allocate
between
those
two
streams
of
income.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
think
those
would
be
classified
just
like
the
ones
in
the
annals,
where
doctors
seeking
employment
or
people
seeking
to
employ
doctors,
and
we
contend
that
those
also
are
not
related
to
the
educational
purposes.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
justice
blackmun,
i'm
not
sure
of
the
kind
of
legal
notices
that
are
referred
to
in
that
'82
revenue
ruling.
it's
possible
that
some
legal
notices
could
be
exempt
from
tax
on
the
ground
that
they're
done
for
the
convenience
of
members.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
i
think
in
any
event,
the
legal
notices
are
distinguishable
from
commercial
advertising.
i
mean,
one
might
say
that
notices
of
employment
are
not
commercial
advertising
because
there's
no
product
being
advertised,
but
the
best
bulk
of
advertising
we
have
here
is
commercial
advertising
for
medical
products
and
that
is
exactly
what
the
regulation
speaks
to.
as
i
noted
before,
this
is
not
a
new
controversy.
congress
explicitly
considered
this
regulation
in
1969.
both
houses
of
congress
held
hearings
upon
it.
they
heard
testimony
from
many
tax-exempt
publishers
and
from
many
tax-paying
publishers,
including
respondent
and
many
other
tax-exempt
and
tax-paying
medical
journals.
after
listening
for
several
days
to
the
same
arguments
respondent
and
amici
are
making
here,
congress
specifically
endorsed
regulations.
the
house
report
stated
that
the
regulations
mainly
affected
the
advertising
income
of
publications
such
as
medical
journals.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
what
happened,
justice
rehnquist,
is
the
regulations
came
out
in
'67,
and
there
were
moves
made
on
the
floor
to
either
stop
them
or
to
defer
their
effective
date
in
1968,
and
those
moves
were
unsuccessful
on
the
promise
that
hearings
would
be
held
the
following
year
to
address
this
issue
in
full.
and
the
hearings
were
commenced
in
'69
in
the
house,
and
the
house
announced
at
the
beginning
of
the
hearings
that
the
purpose
was
to
decide
whether
or
not
advertising
should
be
unrelated
to
trade
or
business.
now,
i
think
the
house
bill
that
mills
introduced
actually
came
in
after
the
hearings
had
begun,
but
the
whole
issue
had
been
served
up
by
the
congress
the
previous
year
and
the
hearings
had
been
scheduled,
to
respond
to
attempts
to
revoke
these
regulations
in
bills
introduced
during
the
previous
year.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
i
think
we're
a
little
bit
stronger.
i
mean,
the
regulations
are
presumptively
valid
in
any
event.
we
have
the
usual
deference
to
the
commissioners'
discretion
in
promulgating
treasury
regulations.
but,
i
think
when
congress
has
held
a
week
of
hearings
on
them
and
looked
at
them
in
detail
and
endorsed
them
explicitly
in
their
reports,
it
gives
an
added
oomph
to
the
regulations.
it
shows
that
congress
did
not
think
they
were
inconsistent
with
the
statute
that
congress
had
enacted.
now,
it's
true,
congress
only
codified
a
portion
of
the
regulations
respecting
fragmentation
of
a
journal
into
advertising
and
editorial
content.
it
did
not
codify
the
example
which
speaks
about
advertising
not
being
related
activity,
but
if
they'd
approved
that
part
of
the
regulations
in
the
course
of
enacting
the
other
thing,
so
although
congress
has
not
codified
the
whole
regulation,
it
has
approved
the
entire
regulation.
and,
we
think
that
adds
to
the
deference
that
should
be
shown
to
the
commissioners'
construction.
in
short,
what
congress
said
is
that,
your
committee
wants
to
make
clear
that
such
regulations
are
valid,
so
we
think
that
this
case
really
presents
a
very
narrow
question
in
view
of
this
regulation
which
congress
has
endorsed,
and
that
is
whether
respondent's
ads
were
designed
and
selected
in
the
manner
of
ordinary
commercial
advertising.
the
claims
court
found
as
a
fact
that
they
were.
the
claims
court
found
that
example
7
closely
resembled
the
situation
here.
it
found
that
respondent's
advertising
was
typical
commercial
publicity.
it
found
that
many
of
respondent's
ads
are
identical
to
those
appearing
in
medical
journals
published
by
non-exempt
organizations.
it
found
that
any
differences
between
respondent's
ads
and
tax-paying
journal
ads
reflected
the
advertiser's
marketing
strategy
rather
than
their
probable
importance
to
the
reader.
the
claims
court
found
that
respondent's
advertising
business
was
operated
in
material
respects
like
the
advertising
business
of
any
other
publication.
those
companies
willing
to
pay
for
space
got
it.
others
did
not.
the
claims
court
found
that
respondent's
rates
were
competitive
with
those
charged
by
taxpaying
medical
journals.
it
found
that
any
educational
function
of
respondent's
ads
was
incidental
to
their
purpose
of
raising
revenue.
it
found
that
many
of
the
products
advertised,
products
like
valium,
tylenol.
darvon,
robitussin,
insulin,
aspirin
and
support
hosiery
were
for
established
products
and
the
ads
were
repeated
from
month
to
month
following
the
normal
commercial
practice.
in
short,
the
factual
findings
of
the
claims
court
make
clear
that
respondent's
ads,
like
those
in
example
7,
were
designed
and
selected
in
the
manner
of
ordinary
commercial
advertising.
that
means,
under
the
regulation,
that
the
publication
of
those
ads
can't
be
educational
activity
and
therefore
the
ad
revenues
are
subject
to
tax.
and
respondent's
main
argument
in
response
to
all
this
is
that
the
regulation
doesn't
apply
to
it.
respondent
notes
that
in
example
7,
the
professional
association
that
publishes
the
journal
there
is
said
to
be
tax-exempt
under
section
501-c-6
which
provides
a
tax
exemption
for
business
leagues
and
trade
associations.
respondent,
although
it
is
also
a
professional
association,
is
organized
instead
as
an
educational
organization
under
section
501-c-3.
respondent
therefore
argues
that
example
7's
principles
should
only
apply
to
groups,
to
publishers
who
are
tax-exempt
under
501-c-6
and
not
to
any
other
tax-exempt
publishers.
as
we
explain
in
more
detail
in
our
brief,
this
argument
is
wrong
for
at
least
three
principal
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
irs
has
always
interpreted
the
principles
of
example
7
to
apply
to
tax
exempt
publishers
across
the
board.
there
are
rulings
which
explicitly
apply
to
example
7,
to
a
501-c-3
group,
and
this
court
has
held
that
the
commissioners'
construction
of
its
own
regulation
is
entitled
to
deference.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
exactly
right,
justice
blackmun.
there
are
literally
dozens
of
occasions
when
it
happens
every
month.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
think
that's
exactly
right,
because
respondent's
argument
would
mean
that
the
same
ad
run
in
the
ama
journal
on
the
same
day
would
be
subject
to
tax
because
ama
is
exempt
under
501-c-6,
but
the
ad
in
respondent's
journal
appearing
the
same
day
would
be
tax
exempt
because
it's
under
501-c-3.
that
does
not
make
a
whole
lot
of
sense,
because
it
would
make
the
tax
elective.
as
explained
in
our
brief,
although
there
are
differences
between
501-c-6
and
c-3
groups
at
the
margins,
in
the
case
of
groups
like
respondent,
that
is,
a
professional
association
drawing
its
members
from
one
profession,
having
very
broad
charitable,
educational
goals,
they
have
basically
an
option
of
being
organized
either
under
501-c-3
or
under
501-c-6.
the
main
practical
difference
is
that
501-c-6
groups
can
lobby
in
congress
and
c-3
groups
cannot,
and
that's
one
reason
why
they
picked
one
rather
than
the
other.
and
the
fact
that
this
option
is
available
is
made
clear
from
the
amicus
briefs
filed
in
this
case,
the
ama
and
the
mass
medical
society,
both
of
which
are
medical
associations
that
have
the
same
purposes,
educational
purposes
as
respondent,
but
both
organized
under
501-c-6.
and,
we
think
it
would
make
no
sense
to
construe
the
regulation
to
apply
to
one
group
of
publishers
and
not
the
other
because
that
would
mean
that
essentially
a
501-c-6
group
could
avoid
this
tax
in
its
entirety
by
setting
up
a
charitable
affiliate
and
have
it
do
the
publishing,
and
congress
could
not
have
meant
that
the
tax
could
be
avoided
so
easily
because
that
would
simply
perpetuate
the
problem
of
unfair
competition
between
taxpaying
and
tax-exempt
publishers
of
medical
and
other
specialized
journals.
if
there
are
no
more
questions,
i
think
i've
had
enough.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
the
first
one
was
that
the
commissioner
has
always
interpreted
example
7
to
apply
to
all
tax-exempt
groups.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
indeed
he
had,
at
the
treasury,
took
the
position
on
the
bill
that
it
would
apply
to
tax-exempt
groups
across
the
board,
although
witnesses
who
testified
before
congress,
which
included
respondent,
respondent
said
in
hearings
that
this
regulation
would
apply
to
it.
now,
they
retracted
that
concession,
but
that's
what
they
said
at
the
time.
all
the
witnesses
took
the
view
that
example
7
applied
to
everybody,
would
result
in
the
taxation
of
their
commercial
advertising
profits.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
the
other
two,
the
second
one
is
that
the...
the
third
i
made,
in
response
to
justice
blackmun's
question,
that
it
would
produce
an
absurd
result.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
the
second
one
is
that
the
reasoning
of
the
example
is
what
we're
relying
upon,
and
the
reasoning
of
the
example
is
that
the
publication
of
commercial
advertising,
advertising
designed
and
selected
in
the
manner
of
ordinary
commercial
advertising,
is
not
educational.
now,
that
logical
conclusion
applies
to
the
matter
of
what
the
source
of
the
publisher's
exemption
is.
i
mean,
it's
either
educational
or
it's
not.
it
doesn't
matter
what
form
you
file
with
the
irs
to
get
exempt,
really,
and
the
reasoning
of
the
example
is
extrapolatable
to
all
kinds
of
tax
exempt
publishers.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
a
few
brief
points,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
like
first
to
address
the
question,
whether
this
is
a
factual
case
or
a
legal
case.
the
claims
court
made
a
number
of
basic
findings
of
fact.
those
findings
included
a
finding
that
any
informational
function
the
ads
served
was
incidental
to
their
purpose
of
raising
revenue,
and
that
the
advertising
was
typical
commercial
publicity.
the
claims
court
them
cited
example
7
of
the
regulations
and
found
that
controlling
because
the
example
says
that
advertising
designed
and
selected
in
the
manner
of
ordinary
commercial
advertising
is
not
educational
and
because
the
claims
court
found
as
a
fact
that
respondent's
ads
were
typical
commercial
publicity,
it
ruled
against
respondent.
now,
the
court
of
appeals,
the
federal
circuit
accepted
all
the
basic
findings
of
fact
of
the
claims
court.
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
was
disagree
with
the
legal
standards,
the
standard
of
commerciality
that
the
claims
court
had
applied
from
the
regulation.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
it
does
make
it
quite
confusing.
they
threw
the
word
in,
"clearly
erroneous",
kind
of
at
the
end
of
the
opinion,
but
they
also
said
that
the
commercial
character
of
the
activities
should
not
be
determinative
and
that
the
claims
court
had
been
distracted
by
the
commercial
character
of
the
ads
and
erroneously
evaluated
them
under
a
more
rigorous
standard
than
is
supplied
by
the
statute.
so,
it
looks
like
what
the
federal
circuit
was
doing
sub
silencio
was
rejecting
this
commerciality
standard
example
7
proposes,
without
mentioning
example
7.
then
it
threw
in
"clearly
erroneous"
at
the
end
for
good
measure.
it
was
not
a
great
piece
of
craftsmanship,
i
grant
you
that.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
in
every
court
below.
in
every
court,
we
argue
that
example
7
is
controlling
and
the
findings
of
the
claims
court...
the
only
relevant
facts,
we
said,
for
trial
are,
is
this
commercial
publicity.
and
those
are
the
facts
that
were
demonstrated
and
found
by
the
claims
court.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
exactly
right,
justice
white,
because
this
is
the
battle
that
was
waged
before
congress
in
1969.
the
argument
respondent
has
given
you
today
is
what
they
argued
to
congress
in
'69.
congress
rejected
that--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--it's
no
longer
open.
congress
had
a
chance
to
do
respondent's
bidding
and
disapprove
the
regulation.
far
from
doing
that,
it
specifically
endorsed
the
regulation
in
both
houses
of
congress,
noting
that
the
regulation
mainly
applied
to--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--he
did.
he
found
the
regulation...
quoted
the
regulation
and
ruled
in
our
favor.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
as
long
as
it
was
typical
commercial
publicity,
and
he
pointed
out
that
it
was.
and
we
said,
we
might
be
able
to
design
the
ads
differently.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
it
said
that
he
had
evaluated
the
evidence
under
an
erroneous
legal
standard
by
focusing
too
much
on
the
similarity
of
respondent's
ads
to
ordinary
commercial
advertising.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
agreed
that
it
was,
because
it
accepted
as
findings
of
fact--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--because
it
was
educational.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
right,
but
the
court
ignored
the
regulation
that
we
think
governs
the
case.
it
says
that
it's
not
educational
if
its
commercial.
that's
the
problem,
and
the
claims...
the
federal
circuit
never
even
mentioned
the
regulation
we
argued
was
controlling
to
it.
and
the
point
is
that
congress
has
resolved
this
controversy
in
favor
of
the
people
who
urge
that
not
taxing
this
publishing
activity,
this
advertising
activity,
would
lead
to
unfair
competition.
thank
you.
