mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
i
will
begin
my
rebuttal,
my
response,
with
some
response
to
positions
taken
by
my
opposing
counsel,
and
i
will
begin
with
what
was
the
most
important
error
by
opposing
counsel
in
characterizing
the
record.
he
said
that
two
teacher
told
matt
fraser
don't
give
it,
is
what
he
said.
i
will
quote
from
the
record:
"i
told
matt
that
his
speech
was
inappropriate
and
that
he
probably
should
not
deliver
it.
"
that
was
the
first
teacher,
who
was
most
critical
of
the
speech,
mrs.
hicks.
that's
at
page
30
of
the
joint
appendix.
the
second
teacher,
i'm
quoting:
"my
response
at
that
time
was
that
i
told
matt
that
this
would
indeed
cause
problems
and
that
it
would
raise
eyebrows.
"
that
was
the
extent
of
his
warning
not
to
give
the
speech.
none
of
them
suggested
that
it
might
violate
a
school
rule.
if
fact,
the
first
teacher,
who
was
most
critical
of
it,
said
in
her
testimony
afterwards
at
the
trial:
"i
wasn't
that
there
was
a
school
rule
regarding
that.
"
in
this
case,
if
the
teachers
don't
have
any
idea
that
such
a
speech
might
violate
a
school
rule,
when
they
are
charged
with
enforcement
of
the
school
rule
as
among
their
duties
as
teachers,
the
rule
is
clearly
so
vague
and
so
lacking
of
adequate
notice,
at
least
when
it
comes
to
first
amendment
rights,
freedom
of
speech,
that
they
cannot
punish
a
student
who
gave
a
speech
after
previewing
it
with
three
teachers.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
the
written
rule
is
the
same
rule
that
we're
talking
about
here.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
yes,
it
does.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
the
rule
does
not
say
one
shall
not
swear
in
latin
class.
the
rule
says
that
obscene
or
profane
language
will
be
considered
disruptive.
certainly,
the
disruptive
conduct
exception
articulated
by
tinker
can
reach
the
content
of
speech,
can
reach
speech
which
due
solely
to
its
content
is
disruptive.
and
i
suggest
in
latin
class
profanity
would
distract
students
from
the
lessons
at
hand,
would
show
disrespect
to
the
teacher,
and
would
disrupt
the
order
of
the
class,
and
would
be
disruptive
of
the
educational
process.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
well,
we
must
distinguish
carefully
between
profanity
or
dirty
words,
which
are
relatively
easily
identified,
and
which
have
very
few
purposes
that
are
other
than
to
insult
or
to
create
a
negative
emotional
reaction
or
to
vent
a
negative
emotional
reaction,
and
sexual
metaphors,
which,
especially
in
this
case,
did
not
have
any
such
purpose,
to
insult
or
to
vent
an
emotional
reaction
or
to
create
a
negative
emotional
reaction.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
a
rule
which
prohibited
speech
describing
sexual
conduct?
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
i
think
it's
very
difficult
for
students,
or
for
that
matter
for
anyone,
to
anticipate
how
other
juvenile
students
will
respond
to
any
particular
speech.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
i'm
saying
that
a
rule
which
prohibits
speech
that
might
stimulate
a
response
by
someone
else
which
has
a
sexual
character
would
be
a
rule
that
would
be
far
too
vague
and
too
overbroad
to
withstand
first
amendment
scrutiny.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
well,
certainly
a
rule
which
prohibits
obscene
speech,
and
obscene
speech--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
--no.
i
think
counsel
is
misconstruing
the
opinions
of
this
court
when
they
suggest
that
miller
is
the
test
that
must
be
met
for
obscenity
in
the
high
schools.
ginsberg
suggests
that
obscenity
is
a
much
lower
standard,
a
much
easier
standard
to
meet
for
children,
and
this
speech
might
well
have
been
obscene
for
elementary
schools
or
junior
high
schools
under
the
proper
miller
and
ginsberg
test.
i
don't
think
that
we
need
a
full
miller
test
at
the
high
schools.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
how
would
i
limit
the
use
of
"obscene"?
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
that
word
was
in
the
rule.
in
the
case
of
fcc
versus
pacifica,
there
was
a...
that
rule
prohibited
indecent
speech.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
this
rule
does
not
prohibit
indecent
speech.
it
only
prohibits
"obscene,
profane
language
or
gestures.
"
when
it
refers
to
language,
it's
clearly
talking
about
words,
as
in
the
result
in
the
fcc
case.
it's
talking
about
dirty
words.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
with
respect
to
vagueness
of
the
rule,
it
certainly
would.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
the
issue
before...
we
have
two
issues
before
us.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
one,
whether
the
rule
can
survive
scrutiny
under
vagueness
and
overbreadth;
and
two,
whether
this
speech
would
be
protected
no
matter
what
rule
was
promulgated
by
the
school
before
it
was
presented.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
if
this
speech
cannot
be
protected,
then
certainly
that
rule
would
be
sufficient
to
punish
mr.
fraser
in
this
case.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
if
this
speech
can
be
prohibited
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
well,
a
rule
which
prohibits
speech
that's
protected
by
the
constitution
is
not
a
valid
rule.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
this
court
has
yet
to
decide
whether
this
speech,
although
it's
been
decided
by
two
courts
below,
is
protected
by
the
constitution.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
my
position
is
this
speech
is
in
fact
protected
by
the
constitution.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
well,
in
fact
this
student
was
not
given
the
handbook
until
after
he
was
disciplined
in
this
case,
and
so
i'm
not
suggesting
that
he
actually
read
the
rule
and
was
confused.
but
this
is
the
rule
that
had
guided
the
school
for
all
the
years
that
he
had
been
at
the
school,
and
it
had
not
been
applied
to
speeches
which
used
no
profanity,
were
not
in
any
way
disruptive
of
a
class
or
any
curricular
activity,
or
for
that
matter
any
extracurricular
activity.
and
there
were
speeches
that
had
been
given
at
the
same
nominating
assembly
one
year
earlier
which
contained
a
four
letter
word
and
contained
a
sexual
reference.
that
student
was
not
suspended
from
school.
he
was
simply
lectured
in
what
i
would
suggest
is
an
appropriate
fashion
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
well,
i
think
the
proper
standard
for
profane
words
in
the
high
schools
is
the
tinker
standard,
and
profane
words
might
in
most
cases,
almost
all
cases,
be
disruptive
of
the
educational
process.
they
would,
when
they're
used
from
one
student
to
another,
tend
to--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
--whether
each
particular
speech
is
protected
by
the
constitution
depends
upon
the
context
of
that
speech.
i
can
easily
imagine
that
his
use
of
profanity
might
have
created
antagonism
between
students,
as
a
racial
slur
or
a
religious
epithet
might
have,
and
yet--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
--if
the
school
had
a
rule
which
prohibited
the
use
of
dirty
words--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
--it's
a
difficult
question,
but
i
think
that
it
could
be
prohibited
and
the
punishment
would
be
appropriate.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
the
basis
is
twofold
for
distinguishing
between
the
use
of
profanity
or
dirty
words
and
mere
sexual
allusion
or
imagery.
first
of
all,
we
know
what
dirty
words
are,
we
know
what
profanity
is.
it's
a
much
clearer
line
and
a
much
easier
standard
to
apply,
both
for
administrators
in
the
schools
and
for
courts
developing
principled
decisions
under
it.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
well,
i
do
not
see
this
rule
as
applied
in
this
case
as
a
time,
place
and
manner
restriction.
i
see
it
very
much
as
a
content
restriction.
that
does
not
mean
that
it
is
impermissible
in
the
schools,
because
certainly
schools
can
regulate
the
content
of
speech
under
the
tinker
standard...
disruption.
but
in
this
case,
this
particular
speech
was
not
disruptive.
the
sexual
metaphor
that
was
used
in
this
speech
was
not
in
any
way
intended
to
insult
or
create
divisiveness
between
students
or
cause
any
disruption,
and
the
record
shows
that
there
was
no
disruption.
first
of
all,
when
matt
fraser
was
accused
of
violating
a
school
rule
no
one
mentioned
that
they
thought
he
disrupted
the
educational
process.
they
presented
five
letters
to
him
which
characterized
the
speech
as
inappropriate,
obscene,
profane,
et
cetera,
and
those
letters
did
not
mention
that
they
thought
that
there
had
been
any
disruption.
it
wasn't
until
the
attorneys
for
the
school
district
got
involved
with
this
case
that
the
justification
on
the
basis
of
disruption
was
advanced.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
that
if
it
was
profane
or
obscene?
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
or
indecent?
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
well,
the
rule
does
not
prohibit
indecent
speech.
my
webster's
seventh
collegiate
dictionary
does
not
define
the
word
"obscene"
to
include
"indecent".
the
dictionary
which
they
cite
includes
"offensive
to
modesty",
and
i
submit
that
any
speech
which
is
offensive
to
modesty
cannot
be
prohibited
within
the
school
rules.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
it
might
indeed.
stupid
speeches,
and
for
that
matter
humorous
speeches,
are
protected
by
the
constitution.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
no,
personally
i
don't
find
it
offensive.
the
record
suggests
that
most
of
the
students
were
quite
entertained
by
the
speech,
that
it
did
succeed
in
establishing
a
rapport
with
the
students,
and
that
they...
it
succeeded
in
getting
the
candidate
elected.
sex
is
not
a
forbidden
topic
for
students.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
his
candidate.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
the
candidate
might
have
been
elected
had
the
speech
not
been
given.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
say
that
again?
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
well,
the
school
district
attempts
to
justify
its
punishment
on
the
assertion
that
some
students
in
the
audience
might
have
been
offended
by
the
speech,
and
i
don't
think
that's
a
sufficient
justification
to
prohibit
speech
in
our
society.
in
our
society,
especially
in
the
political
context,
which
this
speech
certainly
was,
speech
which
offends
a
few
people
because
they
choose
not
to
hear
a
speech
of
that
sort
is
nevertheless
protected
by
the
constitution.
that
is
one
of
the
elements
of
our
system
of
government,
our
system
of
democracy,
that
gives
it
its
strength.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
it
is
very
much
a
political
speech.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
the
messages
that
he
conveyed,
the
content,
which
included
sexual
allusions,
was
part
of
a
political
speech.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
no,
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
within
the
school
environment,
speech
within
political
speech
can
be
regulated
which
is
disruptive
of
the
educational
process.
any
disruption
which
is
likely
to
spill
over
into
the
hallways
or
classrooms
or
create
personal
antagonisms
between
students
might
well
be
prohibited.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
the
teachers,
before
they
talked
to
their
attorneys,
did
not
claim
that
the
speech
disrupted
the
educational
process.
the
trial
court
specifically
found
that
there
was
no
disruption
of
the
educational
process.
both
of
the
judges
in
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
there
was
no
disruption
of
the
educational
process,
and
the
judge
who
dissented
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
his
dissenting
opinion
did
not
find
any
disruption
shown
in
the
record.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
i
do
very
much
think
they
have
duties
to
teach
moral
values,
decency
in
speech,
societal
values.
but
teaching
is
best
accomplished
through
persuasion
and
example,
not
mere
punishment,
which
tends
to
produce
rebellion
within
adolescents.
and
that
is
a
more
than
adequate
alternative
in
this
case
for
teaching
those
community
values,
for
achieving
that
state
interest.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
well,
i
think
the
federal
court--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
--certainly
the
courts
should
not
be
in
the
position
of
deciding
what
is
in
good
taste
and
what
is
not
in
good
taste,
what
is
appropriate
and
what
is
not
appropriate.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
that's
not
my
reading
of
the
opinion.
my
reading
of
the
opinion--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
--i
think
that
the
judge
is
saying,
and
this
would
be
my
view,
that
the
courts
should
not
involve
themselves
in
questions
of
whether
the
speech
was
inappropriate
or
distasteful.
the
question
is
whether
this
speech
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
and
those
who
are
in
a
position
to
judge
whether
it's
distasteful
or
inappropriate
are
the
students
and,
for
that
matter,
the
teacher
and
administrators
who
might
tell
the
students
and
tell
this
particular
student
that
the
speech
is
distasteful
and
inappropriate
and
they
think
that
it
should
not
be
used
in
a
political
assembly.
but
once
the
students
are
granted
the
forum
to
exercise
students
politics,
to
say
you
can
have
an
experience
in
american
politics,
but
it
won't
be
a
complete
experience
because
we're
not
going
to
give
you
freedom
of
speech,
we're
going
to
censor
what
you
have
to
say
and
limit
it,
we're
going
to
prohibit
from
you
speech
which
is
on
a
very
important
topic
to
your
peers,
a
topic
that
is
constantly
on
the
minds
of
teen-agers,
really
gives
them
an
inappropriate
message.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
of
course
they
can
place
the
limit
that
the
method
of
campaigning
or
the
content
of
campaign
speeches
not
be
disruptive
within
the
educational
environment.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
no,
i
don't...
once
they
grant
the
students
a
forum
for
political
speech,
for
conducting
their
own
political
exercises,
they
cannot
tell
the
students
that
their
speeches
must
be
in
good
taste.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
i
don't
think
that
the
schools
can
do
that.
i
think
that
once
they--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
--certainly
they
can.
that
is
a
curricular
activity.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
certainly.
they
could
give
him
a
bad
grade,
they
could
kick
him
out
of
the
classroom.
if
it
were
a
repeated
problem,
they
could
suspend
him.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
this
was
in
an
extracurricular
activity.
when
we're
balancing
the
interests,
the
state
interests--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
--well,
no.
but
whenever
students
are
granted
a
period
of
time
to
conduct
extracurricular
activities,
they
aren't
free
to
go
home.
they
must
choose
one
of
the
extracurricular
activities
or
go
to
a
study
hall,
and
that
was
the
choice
here.
there
was
only
one
extracurricular
activity
offered,
participating
in
student
politics.
but
just
because
the
state
says
they
must
offer
the
students
an
opportunity
to
conduct
student
politics
doesn't
mean
that
students
have
to
attend.
they
could
all
have
gone
to
study
hall.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
the
estimates
are
that
almost
all
the
students
or
virtually
all
the
students
did
attend
the
assembly.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
no,
i
am
not
familiar
with
them.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
no,
i
wouldn't
venture
a
view
on
that.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
well,
if
you
would
like
my
off
the
cuff
analysis,
it
seems
to
me
that
once
a
group
of
people
assemble
together
they
can
adopt
rules
among
themselves
to
control
their
own
behavior
within
the
organization.
and
likewise,
the
students
themselves
could
have
adopted
a
rule
which
would
say:
within
the
conduct
of
our
student
politics
or
within
our
particular
party,
we're
going
to
have
a
party
assembly
and
meeting
and
we're
going
to
say
that
none
of
our
members
will
be
able
to
give
speeches
of
this
sort,
or
this
topic
is
taboo.
yes,
i
do
think
they
could
do
that
as
a
matter
of
the
rules
of
the
body
of
an
organization.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
if
the
students
are
voluntarily
participating
in
an
organization
and
that
organization
adopts
rules
for
the
conduct
of
its
own
meetings
or
activities,
then
yes,
i
think
that
organization
can
adopt
such
rules.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
well,
you're
asking
for
my
off
the
cuff
analysis
and
i'm
viewing
it
as
an
organization
that
is
analogous
to
a
private
organization.
the
state
has
various
interests
in
the
public
schools
that
must
be
balanced
against
the
first
amendment
interests
within
the
public
schools.
in
the
classroom
the
interest
tips
strongly
in
favor
of
the
state,
because
there
are
many
sorts
of
speeches
which
based
on
their
content
might
be
disruptive
of
the
educational
process.
in
the
extracurricular
activities,
it
tips
much
more
the
other
way;
and
in
student
politics
it
tips
the
farthest
of
any
of
those
extracurricular
activities.
politics
is
an
area
where
speech
is
accorded
its
highest
protection.
if
we
allow
schools
to
tell
students
that
they
will
have
an
experience
in
politics
within
america
and
then
tell
them
that
they
can
be
punished
if
they
give
expression
which
the
administrators
find
distasteful
or
inappropriate,
but
nothing
more
serious
than
that,
we
are
teaching
the
students
an
ugly
lesson,
that
those
in
power
can
suppress
the
speech
of
those
with
whom
they
disagree.
this
is
a
pure
speech
case.
this
case
does
not
involve
the
maintenance
of
discipline
in
the
school,
the
control
of
the
use
of
drugs,
weapons
or
violence.
it's
not
a
situation
where
the
school
administrators
need
more
tools
to
maintain
an
educational
environment.
if
the
educational
environment
were
disrupted
by
this
speech,
yes,
it
could
be
prohibited.
but
it
wasn't.
the
teachers
of
this
country
believe
that
they
have
adequate
tools
to
deal
with
this
problem,
that
this
is
not
a
serious
problem
within
the
schools,
when
students
present
speech
which
contain
sexual
metaphors
no
different
from
what
they're
taught
in
the
classes
in
shakespeare.
romeo
and
juliet
is
a
standard
text
within
the
classes
and
there
are
sexual
allusions
and
metaphor
in
romeo
and
juliet
that
are
more
explicit,
that
are
actually
describing
sexual
activity.
when
students
are
allowed
to...
are
presented
this
in
the
classroom,
teachers
do
not
find
that
they
have
a
problem
dealing
with
this
problem
with
students.
i
will
respond
to
the
assertion
of
the
captive
audience.
all
audiences,
of
course,
are
to
a
certain
extent
captive.
but
the
form
of
expression
used
in
this
case
is
not
unusual
for
high
school
students.
this
is
not
something
that
the
audience
who
attended
this
assembly
would
have
been
surprised
to
hear.
they
heard
a
sexual
reference
and
a
four
letter
word
in
a
speech
at
a
similar
assembly
one
year
earlier.
sexuality
is
a
topic
that
is
of
great
interest
to
teenagers.
commonly
known
statistics
show
that
a
great
number
of
teenagers
are
in
fact
becoming
pregnant
while
in
high
school.
if
we
want
to
teach
students
to
discuss
the
topic
of
sexuality
properly,
appropriately,
responsively--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
--i'm
suggesting
that
if
the
schools
want
to
teach
the
students
that
this
speech
is
inappropriate,
they
should
tell
that
to
the
students.
they
should
conduct...
convene
an
assembly
of
the
students
and
give
them
a
presentation
on
why
this
speech
is
inappropriate,
a
presentation
on
what
political
speech
in
america
is
all
about
and
what
kind
of
speech
in
the
adult
world
is
persuasive
and
what
is
offensive.
they
should
present
that
to
all
the
students.
they
could
present
that
to
matt
fraser
himself.
and
that...
and
the
national
education
association
has
taken
the
position
that
that
is
a
more
than
adequate
tool
for
dealing
with
this
problem,
that
sexual
metaphor
is
not
a
serious
problem
in
the
schools,
unlike
other
discipline
problems.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
that
is
correct.
my
opposing
counsel
suggests
that
speech
can...
that
the
local
rules
should
be
adopted
by
local
school
boards
and
with
presumably
the
approval
of
the
local
parents,
and
that
those
rules
ought
to
apply
whether...
no
matter
what
the
rules
are.
well,
the
cases
of
tinker
and
west
virginia
versus
barnette
show
that
that
cannot
be
the
law
in
this
country,
tinker
and
west
virginia
versus
barnette
make
it
clear
that
the
constitution
does
restrict
the
latitude
of
local
school
boards
from
adopting
rules
of
that
nature.
let
me
return
to
the
vagueness
issue.
the
construction
that
the
school
board
has
applied
in
this
case
to
the
rule
was
made
after
the
speech
was
presented.
there
is
nothing
that
was
done
to
construe
this
rule
or
give
the
students
notice
that
a
rule
prohibiting
obscene,
profane
language
would
apply
to
a
speech
which
contains
no
profanity
or
no
speech...
no
words
which
by
themselves
would
cause
offense.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
i
do
think
that
shows
that
he
was
concerned
that
it
might
violate
a
school
rule,
and
that
when
he
was
told...
when
none
of
the
teachers
suggested
that
it
might
violate
a
school
rule
and
none
of
them
took
any
action
to
block
the
presentation
of
his
speech,
none
of
them
told
him
not
to
give
the
speech
or
went
to
the
administration
and
said--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
--the
record
shows
that
the
teachers
responded
in
the
proper
fashion
under
the
first
amendment.
they
gave
more
speech
to
present
their
view
of
the
propriety
of
his
speech
and
they
indicated
to
him,
but
matt,
we
will
leave
it
up
to
you;
if
you
think
that
this
is
a
speech
that
you
want
to
present
at
that
political
assembly,
then
we're
not
going
to
stop
you.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
well,
the
third
teacher,
whose
testimony
was
not
explicitly
stated
in
the
record
of
the
trial
court,
but
whose
analysis
of
the
speech
was
presented
in
a
letter
given
to
the
administration,
which
is
reprinted
at
the
end
of
the--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
--well,
the
record
does
not
suggest
why
he
went
to
the
teachers
at
all
in
any
specific
manner.
my
understanding
from
working
on
this
case
from
the
beginning
is
that
he
went
to
the
teachers
for
two
reasons:
one,
to
see
whether
they
thought
that
he
would
get
in
trouble
for
presenting
the
speech
or
whether
this
was
something
that
they
wanted
to
stop;
and
two,
because
he
had
a
relationship
with
these
teachers
of
student
and
teacher
and
he
wanted
to
show
them
what
he
was
doing,
he
wanted
to
show
them
how
clever
he
was
and
how
artfully
he
had
created
a
speech
which
would
be
very
entertaining
to
his
classmates.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
haley
i
believe
the
record
contains
the
analysis,
the
comments
of
some
of
the
people
in
the
school,
teachers
or
students,
who
did
view
the
speech
as
clever.
i
think
within
the
context
of
the
adolescent
mind
and
the
kinds
of
things
that
they're
interested
in,
they
did
find
it
very
clever.
my
time
is
up.
