justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
students
are
there
involved
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
a
matter
of
fact,
wasn't
that
speech
given
to
a
teacher
the
day
before?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
wasn't
told
by
the
principal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
know
that,
but
did
the
teachers
have
authority
to
stop
him
from
making
the
speech?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
asking
you,
did
they
or
did
they
not
have
authority
to
stop
him
from
making
the
speech?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
a
teacher
teaching
chemistry
tells
the
child,
don't
go
to
dance
class,
that
wouldn't
be
enforceable.
that's
why
i
was
asking
what
authority.
was
this
his
teacher?
was
it
his
home
room
teacher?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
it
just
a
teacher?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
what
i'm
getting
at...
i'm
not
trying
to
be
mysterious
about
it.
if
the
school
had
a
possibility,
had
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
stop
the
speech,
it
would
be
a
different
case,
wouldn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at.
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
counsel,
do
you
tell
me
that
if
i
find
that
it
was
any
one
of
those
three
words
i
have
to
rule
against
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
had
a
third
one.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
a
stupid
speech
might
be
offensive.
a
stupid
speech
might
be
offensive.
[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
wouldn't
you
find
this
speech
offensive
to
intelligent
people?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
think
that
speech
got
him
elected?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
that
speech
got
that
candidate
elected?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
really
want
to
blame
that
on
600
people?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
want
to
blame
that
on
600
people?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
were
passed
out
to
the
students?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
know
also
that
a
$2
million
portrait
is
also
available
to
me
if
i
put
up
$2
million
for
it.
was
it
given
to
the
students?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes
or
no?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
had
to
go
to
the
office
to
get
it?
