mr.
william
a.
coats
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
is
this
case
is
whether
a
public
school
district
may
regulate
indecent
speech
in
a
public
school
setting
that
does
not
amount
to
obscene
speech
under
this
court's
miller
versus
california
standard.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
that
on
april
26th,
1983,
matt
fraser,
a
17
year
old
high
school
senior,
gave
a
speech
to
the
associated
student
body.
the
speech
was
to
introduce
his
candidate
for
the
vice
president's
position
of
the
associated
student
body.
he
gave
a
crude
and
vulgar
speech.
the
speech
is
set
forth
in
full
in
the
briefs
and
there's
no
purpose
to
repeat
it
here.
it
is
important
to
note
that
mr.
fraser
did
obtain
significant
reaction
to
his
speech,
that
some
of
the
students
hooted
and
hollered,
some
of
the
students
looked
bewildered,
some
looked
embarrassed.
some
students
even
acted
out
certain
physical
acts
symbolizing
various
sexual
acts.
after
the
speech,
the
school
administration
investigated
the
incident
and
provided
mr.
fraser
with
his
due
process
rights
and
suspended
him
for
three
days
and
struck
him
from
the
list
of
those
candidates
who
would
be
considered
to
be
a
graduation
speaker.
mr.
fraser
appealed
to
the
district
court.
the
district
court,
as
affirmed
by
the
ninth
circuit,
has
ruled
that
public
school
districts
can
only
regulate
student
speech
if
it
is
obscene
under
the
miller
versus
california
standard,
or
the
one
exception
they
seemingly
recognized
is
if
the
speech
caused
a
physical
disruption
or
there
was
a
reasonable
prediction
of
a
physical
disruption.
finally,
the
district
court,
as
affirmed
by
the
ninth
circuit,
struck
down
the
district's
disruptive
conduct
rule,
holding
it
was
overbroad
and
vague.
it
is
well
decided
and
we
agree
that
students
do
not
shed
their
constitutional
rights
at
the
schoolhouse
door.
however,
it
is
equally
well
decided
that
those
constitutional
rights
will
be
administered
in
a
way
that
is
sensitive
to
the
speech
environment.
we
are
here
because
the
ninth
circuit
we
believe
has
misconstrued
the
extent
of
the
rights
a
student
has
under
the
first
amendment
in
the
public
school
setting.
they
failed
to
recognize
the
special
relationship
between
students
and
their
teacher;
and
finally,
they
failed
to
recognize
the
secondary
effects
such
conduct
has
in
the
public
school
setting.
in
beginning
our
analysis
of
the
first
amendment,
it
is
useful
to
compare
this
case
with
this
court's
decision
in
tinker
versus
des
moines
school
district.
in
tinker,
the
facts
were
that
students
wore
black
arm
bands
into
the
public
schools
in
protest
of
the
vietnam
war.
there
was
nothing
intrinsically
harmful
about
the
black
arm
bands.
what
the
school
officials
were
concerned
about
was
that
the
black
arm
bands
stood
for
protest
against
this
government's
position
in
vietnam.
tinker
was
a
viewpoint
discrimination
case,
where
the
school
officials
determined
that
that
viewpoint
on
an
important
student
policy
issue
should
not
be
interjected
in
the
school
system.
contrasting
that
case
with
this
fact
pattern,
it
is
noteworthy
that
mr.
fraser
at
testimony
was
asked,
"what
was
the
purpose
of
your
speech?
"
he
responded
quite
candidly:
"i
gave
the
speech
to
humor
my
audience,
in
the
hopes
they
would
vote
for
my
candidate.
"
there's
no
overriding
public
policy.
mr.
william
a.
coats
his
candidate
did
win.
mr.
william
a.
coats
approximately
600,
justice
marshall,
in
this
school
setting.
mr.
william
a.
coats
it's
a
school
that
has
sophomores
through
seniors,
so
the
youngest
would
be
14,
the
oldest
would
be
18,
and
they
would
range
in
there
according
to
their
grades.
mr.
fraser...
you
will
note
that
the
district
did
not
take
cavalierly
his
claims
that
he
was
being
discriminated
against
or
that
somehow
his
viewpoint
was
being
suppressed.
if
you
review
the
record
in
this
case,
you'll
find
that
mr.
fraser
appealed
to
the
district's
hearing
officer
from
the
decision
of
his
building
principal,
and
i
think
if
you
read
that
decision,
which
is
part
of
the
joint
appendix,
that
one
of
the
conclusions
that
was
not
overturned
by
the
district
court
was
that
there
was
no
viewpoint
discrimination
here,
that
the
district's
sole
concern
was
to
limit
vulgarity
and
indecent
language
in
the
school
setting.
this
court
has
been
very
clear
and
has
often
repeated
that
it
does
not
want
to
get
involved
in
the
daily
operations
of
the
school
system,
that
it
only
wants
to
get
involved
when
core
constitutional
values
are
involved
and
sharply
implicated.
this
court
has
also
indicated
that
the
regulation
of
vulgarity
and
indecent
speech
is
on
the
periphery
of
the
first
amendment.
we
submit
to
this
court
that
when
you
review
this
case
one
of
the
issues
is
where
does
the
federal
court
system
relate
itself
to
the
public
schools.
and
we
would
suggest
to
you,
with
the
rights
herein
involved
and
the
speech
here
involved,
absent
viewpoint
suppression,
that
there
should
be
minimal
court
review
and
that
all
a
school
district
should
be
required
to
do
is
to
justify
its
actions
with
a
reasonable
educational
purpose.
mr.
william
a.
coats
well,
i
want
to
be
very
clear
on
what
the
context
is,
because
i
think
that's
important.
it
was,
students
had
the
option
of
either
going
to
the
assembly
or
going
to
a
study
hall.
now,
the
asb,
however,
in
the
state
of
washington
is
an
activity
that
is
statutorily
recognized
and
required.
and
those
statutes,
which
are
rcw-28a.58.115
through
120,
i
think
you'll
find
that
they're
somewhat
uniquely
specific
in
this
area
compared
to
the
other
states
that
i
have
seen.
and
they
make
very
clear
that
this
activity
is
under
the
direction
and
control
of
the
public
school
setting.
so
this
is
no
more
an
elective
activity
that,
for
example,
when
a
student
elects
to
take
drama
rather
than
going
to
a
study
hall.
this
is
a
part
of
the
educational
program
of
this
particular
school
district,
as
it
is
in
other
school
districts
in
of
washington.
mr.
william
a.
coats
clearly
this
is
not
the
case
of
bender
versus
williamsport.
mr.
william
a.
coats
and
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that.
bender
involved
independent
student
activities.
this
activity
is
supported
by
public
funds.
it's
under
the
direction
and
control
and
supervision
of
the
school
authorities.
the
school
officials
lead
the
activity.
we
assign
advisors
to
it.
we
subsidize
it
with
public
funds.
mr.
william
a.
coats
well,
the
answer
is
it's
not
the
same
case
at
all.
mr.
william
a.
coats
the
answer
to
your
question
is
yes.
mr.
william
a.
coats
i
would
think
they
would
be
compelled
to.
this
is
something
that
occurs
during
the
student
day,
when
students
are
required
to
either
be
there
or
in
a
study
hall,
and
i
think
it
would
clearly
further
that
religious
activity
under
the
establishment
clause.
mr.
william
a.
coats
i
think
in
the
school
setting
there
could
be
enclaves
of
privacy,
and
i
think
it
is
important
that
this
case
comes
up
under
the
disruptive
conduct
rule
of
the
district,
and
that
one
of
the
things
that
the
district
has
found
in
its
disruptive
conduct
rule
is
that
obscene
and
profane
speech
is
inherently
harmful
in
a
school
setting.
now,
we
would
say
that
if
somebody
is,
for
example,
swearing
around
others
in
a
school
setting,
that
would
be
a
concern
to
us
and
we
could
discipline
the
student
for
that.
they're
under
the
control
of
the
school
and
we
have
a--
mr.
william
a.
coats
--as
long
as
it
was
a
school
activity.
there
are
certain
private
activities
that
involve
students
that
rent
school
space.
but
as
long
as
it
is
a
school
activity,
my
answer
would
be
yes.
i
think
the
school
and
the
board,
through
its
rulemaking
authority,
have
determined
that
that's
inherently
harmful
to
the
school
climate.
as
long
as
there
is
a
school
activity,
my
answer
to
your
question
would
be
yes.
mr.
william
a.
coats
they're
under
the
control,
and
i
think
that
the
school
has
a
definite
educational
interest
in
maintaining
an
environment
around
the
school
premises
free
from
vulgarities.
students
essentially
are
required
to
be
there.
it's
a
captive
audience
of
school
children.
mr.
william
a.
coats
clearly,
i
think
procedural
due
process
requires
us
to
have
regulations
in
effect.
and
actually,
the
washington
administrative
code
requires
that
and,
it
is
my
understanding,
your
decisions
in
goss
versus
lopez.
so
yes,
we
have
to
have
pre-existing
rules.
in
this
case,
we
did
have
a
rule
and
the
student
was
charged
under
that
rule.
mr.
william
a.
coats
the
ninth
circuit
has
struck
down
the
rule,
claiming
it
was
overbroad
and
vague.
they
overbreadth
argument
depends
on
their
determination
that
our
discipline
and
our
disciplining
a
student
for
use
of
obscene
and
profane
language
is
in
excess
of
our
authority.
the
vagueness
argument
is
a
due
process
argument
that
says
the
rule
is
excessively
vague,
and
that
is
an
issue
that
is
before
the
court.
i
do
think
it
is
important
in
looking
at
the
educational
interests
to
keep
in
mind
that
there
are
really
twofold
educational
interests.
one
of
those
interests
relates
more
to
the
educational
nature
of
this
particular
activity,
that
one
of
the
requirements,
and
something
this
court
has
oft
recognized,
is
that
schools
teach
societal
values.
indeed,
there's
a
statute
in
the
state
of
washington
that
expressly
makes
it
a
duty
of
the
school
district
to
teach
morality,
self-respect
for
others,
and
civility.
the
purpose
of
this
asb
activity
is
multifold,
but
certainly
one
of
them
is
to
teach
these
students
basic
societal
values.
another
object
of
this
activity,
particularly
this
assembly,
is
to
teach
students
the
art
of
public
discourse.
now,
in
this
education
activity
there
is
a
special
relationship
between
the
students
and
their
instructors.
indeed,
the
school
officials
feel
they
would
have
been
remiss
if
they
had
not
corrected
mr.
fraser.
his
speech
was
inappropriate.
it
was
a
bad
speech.
they
as
educators
had
a
duty
to
correct
it.
but
they
not
only
had
a
duty
to
mr.
fraser,
but
they
also
had
a
duty
to
the
other
students
who
were
present.
i
think
when
you
look
at
the
fact-pattern
here,
you
have
a
senior
student,
a
student
who
had
received
honors,
who
was
a
gifted
orator,
and
he
gives
a
speech
such
as
that
contained
in
the
record.
the
impression
that
other
students
get
at
that
assembly
is
that
that
speech
is
appropriate
in
that
particular
context.
the
speech
district--
mr.
william
a.
coats
--the
record
on
that,
it
was
given,
he
claims,
to
three
teachers.
two
teachers
testified.
approximately
ten
minutes
in
advance
of
the
assembly,
mr.
fraser
went
in,
and
the
teacher
was
the
teacher
that
had
the
responsibility
for
the
newspaper.
other
students
were
present,
and
that
teacher
told
mr.
fraser,
she
said,
matt...
and
this
is
her
testimony...
"that
speech
is
inappropriate,
don't
give
it.
"
he
then
went
to
another
teacher,
mr.
dehart.
mr.
dehart
told
him,
and
his
testimony
will
show:
"matt,
that
speech
is
inappropriate,
don't
give
it.
"
mr.
dehart
also
testified
that
it
was
his
recollection
that
he
intimated
there
would
be
severe
consequences
if
he
did.
that
is
the
record
of--
mr.
william
a.
coats
--well,
the
principal
didn't
know
he
was
going
to
give
a
speech.
the
two
teachers
who
reviewed
it
told
him
it
was
inappropriate
and
not
to
give
it.
mr.
william
a.
coats
i
think
the
teachers
exercised--
mr.
william
a.
coats
--they
would
have
authority,
for
example,
to
demand
that
he
go
to
the
office.
but
i
would
submit
to
you
that
that's
really
not
how
discipline
works
and
is
not
a
realistic
view,
that
if
a
teacher
in
a
school
setting
tells
the
student,
that's
inappropriate,
don't
do
it,
and
then
the
student
doesn't
respond,
then
it
becomes
appropriate
for
disciplinary
action.
mr.
william
a.
coats
i
think
that
there
is--
mr.
william
a.
coats
--a
significant
question
of
prior
restraint,
and
if
the
teacher,
you
know,
could
ask
him...
i
would
think
that
we
would
be
premature
there,
in
that
we
did
not
have
a
proper
basis
for
disciplinary
action
until
after
he
gave
the
speech.
mr.
william
a.
coats
yes.
that
is
not
the
facts
here.
mr.
william
a.
coats
okay.
excuse
me.
i
misconstrued
your
question.
the
record
is
as
i
recited
it.
mr.
william
a.
coats
the
school
district
did
have
a
duty
to
these
other
students
to
impress
upon
them
that
in
this
educational
activity
this
type
of
speech
wasn't
appropriate
in
any
way
whatsoever.
and
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
the
district
acted
with
restraint.
again,
if
you
read
the
record
from
the
school
district,
one
of
the
findings
of
the
hearing
officer
who
considered
this
was
that
a
lesser
form
of
corrective
action
would
not
have
corrected
this
particular
problem.
indeed,
the
speech
district
feels
strongly
that
in
its
capacity
as
an
educator
and
dealing
with
these
students
it
had
an
obligation
to
respond
to
this
particular
speech.
mr.
fraser
seems
to
argue
that
the
school
district's
sole
remedy
is
to
talk
it
over
with
him,
to
debate
with
him
the
appropriateness
of
this.
we
submit
to
this
court
that
mr.
fraser's
argument
misconstrues
the
relationship
of
a
student
to
an
educator.
it's
not
a
relationship
of
one
debater
to
another,
that
indeed
the
educator
has
authority
over
the
student
when
properly
exercised.
finally,
we
submit
to
you
that
the
real
question
is
if
the
speech
district
could
regulate
this
speech.
this
court
held
as
recently
as
last
week
in
the
public
utilities
case
out
of
california
that
the
first
amendment
does
not
dictate
that
you
respond
or
ignore
a
speech,
or
as
we
would
phrase
it,
the
first
amendment
may
restrict
a
school
district's
ability
to
censor
various
views
in
the
student
school
system,
but
once
they
are
able
to
regulate
an
area,
such
as
vulgarity
and
indecency,
the
first
amendment
does
not
dictate
how
they
must
go
about
that.
we
also
note
that
there
are
important
secondary
effects
in
this
case.
we
think
it's
important
that
this
came
up
under
the
school
district's
disruptive
conduct
rule,
and
when
you
read
that
rule,
clearly
a
school
district
has
the
right
to
proscribe
disruptive
conduct
in
the
school
setting.
and
this
board
of
directors
in
advance
gave
notice
and
concluded
that
obscene
and
profane
speech
was
inherently
harmful
and
disruptive
to
the
public
school
setting.
essentially
what
the
ninth
circuit
has
held
is
that
a
public
school
district
cannot
reach
that
conclusion
and
cannot
have
such
a
rule.
we
submit
to
you
that
the
board's
determination
that
vulgarity
and
indecency
was
inherently
harmful
in
the
public
school
setting
is
supported
by
a
rational
basis.
first
of
all,
the
school
has
a
duty
to
protect
the
young
adults,
who
are
there
in
essentially
a
captive
audience.
secondly,
such
conduct
is
inherently
demeaning
to
the
school
setting.
this
is
where
we
require
in
the
state
of
washington
students
to
come
to
learn.
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
cases
such
as
pico,
where
the
plurality
spoke,
and
where
it
expressed
its
concern
in
that
opinion
that
the
district
did
not
have
the
authority
to
suppress
ideas
in
the
school
setting,
but
it
had
no
problem,
it
said,
if
there
had
been
a
facially
neutral
rule
designed
to
prohibit
indecent
language
in
a
public
school
setting.
mr.
william
a.
coats
yes.
you'll
find
that
that
was
considered
again
by
the
hearing
officer's
decision
at
the
school
district,
and
the
school
district's
interpretation
of
its
own
rule
is
that
obscene
should
be
given
its
common
and
ordinary
meaning,
which
includes
lewd
and
vulgar
language.
mr.
william
a.
coats
the
speech
does
not
meet
the
standard
of
miller
versus
california.
we
concede
that.
it's
not
close.
but
i
would
point
out
to
you
that
the
standard
that
was
set
out
in
miller
versus
california
on
obscenity
according
to
this
court
was
designed
only
to
prescribe
hard-core
pornography.
and
this
court
has
recognized
that
there
are
some
lesser
standards
which
may
apply
in
particular
situations,
such
as
in
fcc
versus
pacifica,
the
mini
theatres
case
out
of
detroit.
and
we're
suggesting
that
a
lesser
standard
is
appropriate
in
a
public
school
setting.
now,
the
standard
that
we
have
proposed
essentially
is
that
first
you
look
at
the
constitutional
right
we're
enforcing,
and
that
when
there
is
a
suppression
of
ideas
or
a
discrimination
against
ideas,
that
the
school
district
have
to
show
with
a
higher
standard
or
show
some
compelling
interest
its
reason
for
suppressing
those
ideas.
but
here,
where
the
only...
where
the
record
clearly
shows
that
the
only
purpose
for
the
school's
action
was
to
suppress
vulgarity
and
indecency
in
the
public
school
setting,
then
we
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
a
school
district
should
only
have
to
meet
a
standard
of
showing
a
rational
educational
basis,
and
clearly
there
is
such
a
basis.
mr.
william
a.
coats
were
there
prior
cases?
mr.
william
a.
coats
i
think
my
response
to
you
was
that
we
have
no
written
decisions
in
construing
this,
and
that
to
my
knowledge
this
is
the
first
time
that
the
district
had
construed
its
own
rule
where
there
was
a
record
kept.
now,
school
rules
are
enforced
on
a
daily
basis
in
the
public
school
setting,
and
i
can
assure
you
that
if
a
student
swears
or
is
vulgar
in
the
school
setting,
whether
it's
in
a
classroom,
in
the
hall,
or
in
an
assembly,
school
officials
have
taken
corrective
action.
but
most
of
the
time
we
don't
get
an
appeal
from
that.
here
there
was
also,
as
is
shown
in
the
record,
there
was
a
prior
occasion
the
year
before
where
a
student
used,
actually
in
as
asb
assembly,
used
inappropriate
speech.
and
indeed,
the
district
called
the
student
into
the
office,
and
in
fact
the
principal
talked
to
him
and
what
he
would
consider
disciplined
him,
told
him
that,
you
know,
that
better
be
stopped
or
he's
going
to
be
in
trouble.
now,
mr.
fraser
construes
that,
he
says,
well,
he
knew
that
speech
was
given
and
he
thought
that
the
only
that
happened
was
the
principal
called
him
in
and
talked
to
him
about
it,
big
deal.
i
mean,
he
gives
probably
the
best
evidence
we
have
of
why
the
district
in
this
case
was
compelled
to
take
a
more
demonstrative
action
to
impress
upon
the
students
that
this
was
not
appropriate
speech
in
that
particular
forum,
in
that
public
setting.
if
possible,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
william
a.
coats
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
by
way
of
response,
mr.
haley
did
read
from
the
record,
but
he
didn't
go
on.
and
i
did
ask,
when
the
teacher
said,
i
told
him
i
thought
it
could
cause
problems,
i
said:
well,
could
you
explain
what
you
thought
you
implied?
and
the
teacher
said:
well,
i
think
by
saying
that
it
could
cause
problems
and
raise
eyebrows,
i
also
realized
that
the
speech
was
indeed
ambiguous
and
could
be
interpreted
a
number
of
ways.
so
rather
than
debate
with
matt
the
morality
and
profanity
in
it,
i
thought
it
might
be
best
to
just
point
out
or
at
last
try
to
reason
that
it
could
indeed
cause
problems
as
far
as
his
remaining
few
weeks
at
the
school.
i
didn't
know
what
the
consequences
could
be.
and
indeed,
the
teacher
does
not
administer
the
discipline.
but
when
you
read,
a
fair
reading
of
the
record,
when
you
realize
this
is
ten
minutes
before
the
speech,
when
these
teachers
had
other
students
present,
i
think
that
they
went...
their
comments
could
not
be
construed
as
giving
this
student
license
to
say
anything
he
wants
to
say
at
that
assembly.
i
want
to
respond
first
to
justice
powell's
question,
is
this
political
speech?
and
justice
powell,
i'd
refer
you
to
this
court's
decision
in
conick
versus
meyers,
and
in
that
case
the
court
considered
speech
between
an
assistant
district
attorney,
or
actually
a
petition
an
assistant
district
attorney
circulated
in
the
office,
and
she
was
fired
as
a
result
of
that
petition.
and
this
court
in
considering
that
case
said
that
there
was
only
one
question
in
that
petition
that
had
any
public
significance
and
the
rest
of
it
was
just
an
internal
communication
within
the
office,
and
that
this
court
should
not
involve
itself.
we
would
suggest
to
you
that
that
case
applies
here,
that
there
is
no
big
political
issue
being
discussed.
it
was
a
crude
joke.
secondly,
i
want
to
follow
up
on
mr.
justice
renquist's
question
about,
does
it
make
any
difference
is
this
is
a
classroom
or
an
assembly?
and
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
it's
not
up
to
mr.
fraser
to
determine
the
school
district's
curriculum.
and
indeed,
what
the
statute
says
is
that
a
school
district
shall
have
an
associated
student
body,
and
it's
under
the
control
and
direction
of
the
board
of
directors.
now,
if
the
board
of
directors
concludes
that
the
best
educational
environment
is
a
school
assembly,
that
that's
the
proper
place
to
inculcate
values,
that
that's
the
proper
place
to
in
fact
allow
the
students
to
learn
public
discourse,
that
that
does
not
change
any
of
the
factors
which
give
school
districts
the
authority
to
regulate
the
content
of
speech
in
a
school
setting.
there
is
still
the
relationship
of
student
to
teacher.
there
are
still
other
students
around.
now,
he
tried
to
distinguish
away
the
captive
audience.
but
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
what
he's
suggesting
is
that
in
order
to
participate
in
your
school
activities
such
as
this,
in
your
own
school
government,
you
should
have
to
put
up
with
this
type
of
behavior.
that's
clearly
not
the
law.
now
going
to
the
issue
of
notice
and
this
court's
concern
about
a
disruptive
conduct
rule,
i
think,
first
of
all,
it's
important
you
understand
how
these
rules
are
adopted,
and
i
think
the
record
is
clear,
first
of
all,
that
we
do
distribute
student
codes.
this
is
the
total
student
code
for
bethel.
mr.
fraser
testified
that
it
was
available
to
him.
now,
we
can't
force
him
to
read
it.
but
the
board
of
directors
sets
out
its
rules.
mr.
william
a.
coats
it's
available
in
the
school
for
students
to
take.
mr.
william
a.
coats
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
don't--
mr.
william
a.
coats
--it
was
available
to
the
students
in
the
office,
where
they
could
pick
it
up
without
cost
and
where
it
was
available
to
them.
now,
i
cannot
say
it
was
passed
out
in
class.
mr.
william
a.
coats
you
would
have
to
go
to
the
office
to
get
it,
is
my
understanding.
it
was
clearly
available,
however.
we
don't
pass
out,
for
example,
criminal
justice
statutes
either,
but
they
are
available.
i
suggest
to
you
that
even
the
argument
that
the
teachers
should
somehow
be
able
to
waive...
even
if
the
teacher
said
the
speech
was
all
right,
they
shouldn't
be
able
to
waive
and
undo
the
board
of
directors'
own
rule.
now,
in
looking
at
the
rule,
i
would
point
out
that,
in
the
area
of
vagueness
and
overbreadth,
that
outside
of
the
criminal
justice
area
this
court
has
recognized
a
much
broader
standard.
for
example,
in
the
case
of
arnett
versus
kennedy,
this
court
held
that
a
standard
of
efficiency
of
the
service
is
a
basis
for
firing
an
individual.
in
almost
every
labor
contract
throughout
these
united
states,
the
standard
for
disciplining
employees
is
cause
or
just
cause.
in
addition,
in
the
state
of
washington
the
standard
for
firing
teachers
is
sufficient
cause,
without
any
further
elaboration.
these
rules
do
not
have
to
meet
the
same
specificity
requirement
as
criminal
statutes.
furthermore,
it
would
be
totally
impractical,
impractical
for
two
reasons--
mr.
william
a.
coats
--your
honor,
i
think
if
a
teacher
gave
that
speech
at
a
school
assembly,
it
would
be
a
proper
basis
for
disciplining
that
teacher
and
it
would
be--
mr.
william
a.
coats
--i
would
have
some
question
of
whether,
if
it
was
a
first
offense
and
there
was
no
prior
offense,
whether
we
would--
mr.
william
a.
coats
--the
reason
why
it's
difficult
for
me
to
respond
yes
or
no
is
that
it
is
a
sufficient
cause
standard.
i
have
no
doubt
there'd
be
a
basis
for
discipline.
now,
whether
we
could
sustain
a
discharge
in
front
of
an
independent
hearing
officer,
i
have
some
question
in
my
mind
whether
it's
severe
enough,
whether
the
penalty
fit
the
crime.
mr.
william
a.
coats
we
didn't
deprive
him
of
the
right
to
graduate.
mr.
william
a.
coats
yes,
we
could.
there's
no
doubt
and
i
think
there's
a
reasonable
education
debate
on
what
was
the
appropriate
punishment
here.
but
i'd
suggest
to
you
that
that's
not
a
question
that
the
federal
court
need
answer.
that's
something
that's
vested
in
the
sound
discretion
of
the
public
school
administration,
following
the
procedure--
mr.
william
a.
coats
--i
don't
think
it's
a
first
amendment
issue.
i
think
in
any
discipline
case
there's
a
due
process
issue
of
whether
the
punishment
fits
the
crime.
you'll
note
in
the
state
of
washington--
mr.
william
a.
coats
--there's
no
question
he's
being
punished
for
his
speech
here,
and
that
that,
you
know,
whether
or
not
we
can
regulate
that
speech
is
clearly
a
first
amendment
issue.
now,
once
we're
over
that
hurdle,
and
assuming
this
court
says
yes,
you
can
regulate
this
particular
speech,
the
issue
is
then
what's
the
effective
way
of
doing
it,
should
it
have
been
a
two
day
suspension
or
should
we
just
talk
to
him,
should
it
have
been
more,
that
seems
to
me
to
be
an
issue
that
the
first
amendment
does
not
dictate.
the
first
amendment
was
never
designed
to
dictate
curriculum
or
punishment
in
public
schools.
i
think
that
is
something
that's
clearly
vested
in
the
discretion
of
the
school
officials,
within
the
parameters
of
the
due
process
rules
under
which
we
operate.
and
when
you
look
at
the
rule
and
you
judge
its
content,
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
in
washington
the
rules
aren't
drafted
by
lawyers.
we
have
a
statute
that
requires
that
students,
that
parents
and
administrators
actually
work
on
our
codes
and
adopt
them;
that
the
legislature
has
adopted
a
policy
of
participation
of
those
who
have
the
greatest
stake
in
the
educational
outcome
to
actually
work
on
these
rules
and
adopt
them.
so
when
you
look
at
the
word
"obscene",
most
of
the
people
who
are
drafting
this
have
never
heard
of
miller
and
california,
i
would
suggest,
and
are
not
aware
of
the
standards
set
forth
therein;
and
that
the
district's
hearing
officer
was
correct
in
looking
at
its
common
and
ordinary
meaning,
which
includes
indecent.
and
so
i
think
that
we
would
hope
that
you
would
look
at
the
context
of
the
school
rules,
realizing
that
they're
not
drafted
by
attorneys
for
attorneys.
mr.
william
a.
coats
thank
you.
mr.
william
a.
coats
indeed.
it's
exhibit
b
in
the
record,
by
the
way.
mr.
william
a.
coats
it's
exhibit
b
in
the
record,
but
i
will
leave
a
copy
for
the
court
gladly.
thank
you.
