did
his
candidate
win?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
suppose
it
were
a
school
rule
that
explicitly
said
that
speech
that
stimulated
simulated
sexual
conduct
would
be
disciplined,
and
then
suppose
this
speech
had
been
given.
also
assume
the
rule
was
posted
on
the
bulletin
board
of
every
room
in
the
schoolhouse.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
stimulated
simulating
sexual
conduct.
what
i'm
interested
in
is
whether,
if
adequate
notice
were
given
so
that
no
one
could
have
misconstrued
it,
that
this
sort
of
speech
would
result
in
punishment,
what
would
your
response
be?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
you're
saying
that
notice
really
doesn't
matter?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
can
you
conceive
of
any
rule
that
would
not
be
too
vague?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
man
obscene
in
the
miller
sense,
our
decision
in
miller?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
how
would
you
limit
the
use
of
"obscene"
in
this
particular
rule,
then?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
that
word
was
in
the
rule.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
it
had
prohibited
indecent
speech,
would
your
position
be
different?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
think
this
was
political
speech?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it's
a
student
political
campaign,
but
it's
nothing
like
the
speech
in
tinker,
which
really
related
to
politics.
here,
do
you
think
the
words
that
are
particularly
involved
had
anything
to
do
with
the
political
campaign?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
are
you
suggesting
there
could
be
no...
that
the
school
couldn't
regulate
at
all
what
one
said
in
political
speech?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
there's
some
evidence
of
disruption
here,
isn't
there?
some
teacher?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
just
ask
you
one
other
question,
then
i'll
try
to
keep
quiet.
do
you
think
public
schools
have
a
duty
to
teach
anything
except
reading,
writing,
and
arithmetic,
history,
biology,
chemistry?
do
you
think
they
have
any
duty
to
teach
societal
values,
decency
in
speech,
moral
values?
