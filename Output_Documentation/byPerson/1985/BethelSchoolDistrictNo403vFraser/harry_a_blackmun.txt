does
the
school
have
a
written
rule
that
one
shall
not
swear
in
latin
class?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
know.
i'm
asking
you,
yes
or
no?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
one
shall
not
swear
in
latin
class?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
he
must
have
been
somewhat
concerned
about
it,
don't
you
think,
mr.
haley?
he
went
to
some
teachers
and
asked
their
judgment
on
it.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
they
came
pretty
close
to
telling
him
not
to
give
the
speech.
if
he
has
any
sensitivity,
he'd
know
that
that
is
what
they
were
saying.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
they
said
that
in
so
many
words?
you
haven't
read
those
words
to
us.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
why
did
he
go
to
the
teachers
at
all?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
regard
this
as
a
clever
speech?
