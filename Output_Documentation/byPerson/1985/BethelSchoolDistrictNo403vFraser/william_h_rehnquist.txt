what
was
the
grade
or
age
range
of
the
students?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
haley,
supposing
that
the
rule
has
simply
prohibited
this
particular
speech
in
haec
verba,
so
that
there
could
be
no
question
that
the
person
who
was
about
to
deliver
the
speech
knew
that
it
was
prohibited
by
the
rule.
do
you
think
that
rule
is
bad
under
the
first
amendment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
you
answer
the
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
asked
you
a
question.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that
is
your
answer,
that
a
rule
that
prohibited
this
speech
in
so
many
words
would
be
constitutional?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
can
you
give
me
a
non-hypothetical
answer
to
my
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
agree
with
you.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what's
your
position?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
no
matter
how
specific
the
rule
in
giving
notice,
it
would
be
bad
under
the
first
amendment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
this
wasn't
a
speech
about
sex.
i
mean,
it
was
about
politics,
with
sexual
innuendo
in
the
speech.
are
you
saying
that
if
the
school
board
decides
that
there
shall
be
a
campaign
for
student
government
and
student
body
president,
as
apparently
the
state
of
washington
requires,
they
can
place
no
limits
on
the
methods
of
campaigning
that
aren't
placed
on
campaigning
in
the
main
political
forum?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
if
they
just
said
it's
got
to
be
in
good
taste?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
they
said
that
this
forum
is
granted
to
you
on
this
condition,
that
you
speak
in
good
taste?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
they
require
students'
answers
in
a
classroom
to
be
in
good
taste?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
if
a
student
got
up
and
made
an
answer
in
a
classroom
that
was
comparable
to
this,
you
would
say
that
could
be
punished
by
the
school?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
difference
that
you
see
is
that
this
was
in
an
organized
assembly,
rather
than
in
a
classroom?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
"extracurricular
activity",
it
was...
no
student
was
free
to
leave
this
assembly
and
go
home,
was
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
anything
in
the
record
below
that
indicates
what
percentage
of
the
student
body
turned
out
for
this
assembly?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
nea
represents
teachers,
not
school
administrators,
doesn't
it?
