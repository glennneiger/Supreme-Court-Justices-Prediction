mr.
coats,
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
this
is
an
extracurricular
assembly?
it's
not
part
of
the
regular...
the
students
were
not
required
to
attend,
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
your
view,
would
it
be
permissible,
given
that
setting,
for
the
school
board
to
prohibit
the
discussion
of
any
religious
topics
during
any
campaign
speech
or
any
prayer
activities?
let's
all
say
a
prayer
for
candidate
x?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
really
my
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
what
is
your
answer
to
my
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
is
your
answer
to
my
question,
whether
in
your
view
the
school
board
could
prohibit
during
this
particular
kind
of
meeting
any
discussion
of
religious
topics
or
any
prayer
activities
in
support
of
a
candidate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
they
could?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
coats,
may
i
just
ask
on
the
rule,
the
rule
prohibits
disruptive...
i
mean,
material
and
substantial
interference
with
the
educational
process,
including
obscene
and
profane
language.
now,
what
is...
precisely
that
is
your
position,
that
this
was
obscene
language
within
the
meaning
of
the
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
we're
dealing
by
hypothesis
with
speech
that's
non-obscene
for
constitutional
purposes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
this
question
about
it?
i
understand
that
the
board
construed
the
word
obscene
in
this
case
to
cover
this
speech.
is
there
any
prior
history
indicating
within
the
school's
own
proceedings
of
any
kind
that
the
word
"obscene"
as
used
in
the
rule
was
intended
to
be
as
broad
as
interpreted
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
anything
that
would
fairly...
the
question
is
the
same
thing,
i
think,
maybe
justice
o'connor
was
driving
at,
the
fair
notice
to
the
student
as
to
whether
this
speech
was
covered
by
this
word.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
a
teacher
gave
this
speech
at
an
assembly
like
this?
could
he
be
fired
under
the
sufficient
cause
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
he
be
discharged
under
the
sufficient
cause
rule,
do
you
think?
justice
john
paul
stevens
assume
it
was
a
first
offense
and
he
just
thought
it
would
be
a
bright
idea
and
a
real
clever
speech.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
the
nature
of
the
penalty
makes
a
difference,
would
you
suggest
that
perhaps
in
this
context
maybe
you
could
have
called
the
student
in
and
given
him
a
severe
lecture,
but
maybe
not
deprive
him
of
the
right
to
graduate?
or
do
you
think
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
suppose
you
could
have,
though,
couldn't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you're
right,
and
you
may
well
be,
under
this
rule
he
could
have
been
expelled
from
school
and
there'd
be
no
constitutional
objection?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
one
of
the
elements
of
the
crime
is
the
fact
that
it
is
speech?
