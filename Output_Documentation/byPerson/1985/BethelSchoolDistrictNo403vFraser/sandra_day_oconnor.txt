mr
coats,
would
it
make
any
difference
in
your
view
if
the
school
had
tried
to
discipline
the
student
for
activities
occurring
at
lunchtime
or
on
the
school
premises
after
school?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
the
school
could,
for
instance,
prohibit
the
use
of
so-called
four
letter
words
at
any
and
all
times
the
students
are
on
school
grounds,
before,
after,
during?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
lunchtime
a
school
activity,
when
the
students
break
for
lunch?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
the
school
could
implement
its
discipline
in
this
case
had
there
been
no
school
regulation
at
all
on
the
subject?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
we
have
to
decide
in
this
case
whether
the
rule
was
sufficiently
specific
to
give
notice
to
mr.
fraser
of
what
was
prohibited?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
haley,
what
if
the
student
here
had,
instead
of
the
sexual
innuendo
in
the
talk,
incorporated
instead
a
string
of
profane
words?
would
that
have
survived
first
amendment
analysis?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let's
suppose
there
was
the
same
amount
of
disruption
we
had
in
this
case,
but
instead
of
sexual
innuendo,
it
was
a
string
of
profane
words.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
assuming
the
same
amount
of
disruption
that
we
have
here,
would
my
example
create
a
problem
under
the
first
amendment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
same
rule
that
we
have
here.
we
don't
have
the
notice
question.
i'm
interested
in
the
first
amendment
aspect.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
know
the
basis
for
the
distinction
then
in
your
view
for
first
amendment
analysis.
