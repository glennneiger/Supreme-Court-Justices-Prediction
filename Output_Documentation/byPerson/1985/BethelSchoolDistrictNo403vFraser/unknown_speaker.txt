unknown

but
you
think
it's
all
right
in
the
assembly?
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
that
the
students
were
confused
or
this
student
was
confused
by
the
use
of
the
word
"indecent"
or
"obscene"
instead
of
"indecent"?
unknown
speaker
second
of
all,
there
are
very
few
uses
for
profanity
in
the
school
context
which
do
not
tend
to
create
antagonism
between
students
or
tend
to
create
disrespect
between
students
and
teachers
or
tend
to
have
divisive,
disruptive
effects
within
the
school
situation.
there
are
so
few
uses
that
the
school
might
constitutionally
pass,
adopt
a
rule
which
said
its
use
is
entirely
prohibited.
i
suggest
that
a
better
rule
would
say
its
use
in
public
is
prohibited,
and
that
between
consenting
students
on
the
school
grounds
they
might
use
such
profanity,
but
any
time
it's
used
in
public
it
is
so
inherently
likely
to
disrupt
that
we're
going
to
rule
it
out
in
all
cases.
i
think
that
would
be
constitutional.
in
the
last
analysis,
though,
isn't
it
a
regulation
of
the
manner
of
speech,
as
opposed
to
viewpoint
suppression?
unknown
speaker
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
here
indicates
that
he
intentionally
and
knowingly
used
sexual
innuendo
in
his
speech,
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say:
"fraser
did
so
because
he
thought
it
would
be
effective
to
establish
a
rapport
with
his
fellow
students
and
perhaps
amuse
them.
"
"whether
he
succeeded.
"
--this
is
still
the
judge
speaking.
"whether
he
succeeded
or
whether
he
went
over
the
line
of
good
taste
and
became
offensive
is
for
his
fellow
students
to
judge
when
they
cast
their
ballots
in
the
school
election.
"
is
that
really...
am
i
reading
what
a
judge
of
the
federal
court
said?
unknown
speaker
that
the
new
test
is
whether
it
works?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
suggests
that
if
the
candidate
he
was
supporting
had
been
defeated
they
might
have
had
a
different
view,
but
because
it
worked
it
is
all
right.
is
that
your
view,
too?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
does
it
say?
i'll
read
it
to
you
again:
"whether
he
succeeded
or
whether
he
went
over
the
line
and
became
offensive
is
for
his
fellow
students
to
judge
when
they
cast
their
ballots.
"
is
that
your
view,
too?
unknown
speaker
are
you
familiar
with
the
rules
of
the
house
and
the
senate,
at
least
by
legend
and
i
think
accurately,
are
drafted
originally
by
thomas
jefferson?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
you
couldn't
very
well
have
a
view
as
to
whether
or
not
this
same
speech
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
would
be
subject
to
censure?
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
hypothetically...
we've
gotten
into
some,
you
have...
suppose
it
did.
would
you
say
the
first
amendment
would
render
the
rule
of
the
senate
unconstitutional,
if
this
same
rule
were
applied
and
a
senator
were
censured
for
making
this
kind
of
a
speech
on
the
floor
of
the
senate?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
mean
the
first
amendment
would
permit
the
students
to
put
a
limit
which
the
teachers
and
the
school
system
could
not?
unknown
speaker
that's
a
unique
view
of
the
first
amendment.
we've
stricken
statutes
adopted
by
legislatures
sometimes
because
they
violated
the
first
amendment.
unknown
speaker
you're
suggesting
that
this
is
part
of
the
teaching
process?
