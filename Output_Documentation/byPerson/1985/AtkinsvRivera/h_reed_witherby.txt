mr.
h.
reed
witherby
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
is
this
case
is
whether
a
1982
amendment
to
the
medicaid
statute
makes
it
unlawful
for
states
to
use
a
six
month
spenddown
for
determining
medicaid
eligibility
for
the
medically
needy.
the
spenddown
is
the
mechanism
by
which
applicants
who
have
more
income
than
is
necessary
to
provide
their
basic
subsistence
needs
may
still
become
eligible
for
medicaid
after
applying
their
excess
income
to
medical
costs.
it
operates
essentially
like
the
deductible
in
a
health
insurance
policy.
since
1966,
the
secretary
of
health,
education
and
welfare,
and
after
him
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services,
have
authorized
states
to
use
a
period
of
six
months
for
determining
the
amount
of
the
spenddown,
and
most
states
which
have
chosen
to
extend
their
medicaid
coverage
to
the
medically
needy
have
done
so
on
that
basis.
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court,
however,
ruled
below
that
a
1982
amendment
to
the
medicaid
statute
requires
states
to
use
a
one
month
spenddown.
the
supreme
judicial
court
based
its
decision
upon
interpretation
of
the
federal
medicaid
statute
which
has
since
been
explicitly
rejected
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
and
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
decision
below
is
wrong
because
it
ignores
the
language
and
legislative
history
of
the
1982
amendment
and
the
secretary's
regulation
which
was
adopted
and
is
maintained
under
an
express
delegation
of
authority
which
has
never
been
amended.
this
case
presents
a
pure
issue
of
federal
statutory
construction,
and
the
most
important
facts
relate
to
the
structure
of
the
medicaid
program.
medicaid
provides
federal
financial
assistance
to
states
which
choose
to
pay
for
medical
care
for
certain
groups
of
needy
individuals.
states
that
elect
to
participate
in
the
program
must
provide
medicaid
coverage
to
the
categorically
needy,
that
is
those
individuals
who
are
receiving
cash
assistance
under
either
of
the
two
major
federal
categorical
welfare
programs,
the
afdc
program
for
families
with
dependent
children,
or
the
supplemental
security
income
program
for
the
aged,
blind,
or
disabled.
individuals
who
are
receiving
cash
assistance
under
either
of
these
programs
have
only
enough
income
to
meet
their
basic
maintenance
needs
for
food,
clothing,
and
shelter,
and
have
nothing
left
over
to
pay
for
medical
care.
they
are
automatically
eligible
for
medicaid
without
a
spenddown.
participating
states
are
not
required
as
a
general
matter
to
provide
medicaid
benefits
to
any
other
group
of
individuals.
however,
states
may
choose
to
provide
benefits
to
one
or
more
optional
categories,
the
most
significant
of
which
is
known
as
the
medically
needy.
in
order
to
qualify
as
medically
needy,
it
is
necessary
first
to
meet
the
categorical
requirements
for
either
afdc
or
ssi,
in
this
case
afdc.
need
for
medical
assistance
under
the
medically
needy
program
may
be
established
in
one
of
two
ways:
first,
since
the
medically
needy
income
standard,
the
means
test
established
under
the
medically
needy
program,
is
often
higher
than
the
means
test
for
afdc,
eligibility
may
be
established
on
the
basis
of
income.
alternatively,
an
applicant
who
has
income
in
excess
of
the
medically
needy
income
standard
may
still
qualify
as
medically
needy
on
the
basis
of
his
or
her
medical
costs.
this
process,
which
applies
only
to
medicaid
applicants
who
have
already
been
determined
to
be
ineligible
on
the
basis
of
their
income,
is
known
as
the
spenddown.
for
example,
the
first
named
plaintiff
in
this
case,
ms.
rivera,
had
net
income
of
about
$100
a
month
more
than
the
medically
needy
income
standard
for
a
month.
her
spenddown
liability,
in
the
nature
of
a
deductible,
was
six
times
that
amount
or
about
$600,
and
applied
for
a
six
month
period.
if
she
had
incurred
$600
of
medical
costs
at
any
point
during
the
six
month
period,
medicaid
would
have
paid
for
any
further
medical
costs
during
the
period.
however,
ms.
rivera
incurred
medical
costs
of
only
$314
and
therefore
medicaid
paid
for
none
of
those
costs.
it
happened
that
the
entire
$314
was
incurred
during
one
month.
under
a
one-month
spenddown,
ms.
rivera
would
have
been
liable
only
for
the
first
$100
and
medicaid
would
have
paid
the
remainder.
the
amount
of
the
spenddown
deductible
is
what
is
at
issue
in
this
case.
although
the
secretary
since
1966
has
permitted
states
to
use
a
six-month
period
to
measure
available
excess
income
for
this
determination,
the
court
below
held
that
a
one
month
period
must
be
used.
for
this
ruling
it
relied
upon
a
1982
amendment,
part
of
the
tax
equity
and
fiscal
responsibility
act
of
1982,
tefra,
which
requires
states
to
use
the
same
methodology
which
would
be
employed
in
the
applicable
cash
assistance
programs,
in
this
case
afdc,
for
determining
the
income
and
resource
eligibility
of
the
medically
needy.
the
court
below
asserted
that
the
length
of
the
spenddown
period
is
part
of
the
methodology
for
determining
income
eligibility,
and
concluded
that
the
amount
of
the
spenddown
must
be
calculated
using
one
month's
excess
income,
since
afdc
eligibility
is
determined
on
a
monthly
basis.
this
ruling
is
simply
incorrect.
the
length
of
the
spenddown
is
not
part
of
the
methodology
for
determining
income
eligibility
under
the
afdc
program.
that
methodology
does
not
include
taking
into
account
medical
costs
at
all.
if
ms.
rivera
had
applied
for
afdc,
her
income
eligibility
would
have
been
determined
without
regard
to
her
medical
costs,
and
in
fact
when
she
applied
for
medicaid
as
medically
needy
her
income
was
determined
by
that
same
methodology
and
she
was
determined
to
be
ineligible
on
the
basis
of
her
income.
the
spenddown
is
an
extra
step,
unique
to
the
medically
needy,
which
is
not
part
of
the
determination
of
income
eligibility.
it
cannot
be
determined
under
the
same
methodology,
because
eligibility
on
the
basis
of
medical
costs
through
the
spenddown
is
the
most
fundamental
difference
between
the
categorically
needy
and
the
medically
needy.
it
is
what
distinguishes
these
two
groups
from
each
other.
the
scope
of
the
same
methodology
which
would
be
employed
language
is
made
very
clear
by
a
consideration
of
the
dynamic
which
generated
it.
the
term
methodology
had
its
genesis
in
new
regulations
which
the
secretary
issued
on
september
30,
1981,
to
implement
the
omnibus
budget
reconciliation
act
of
1981,
obra.
prior
to
obra,
the
secretary
had
required
states
to
use
the
same
rules
for
evaluating
items
of
income
in
the
medically
needy
program
as
would
be
used
in
the
underlying
categorical
program,
in
this
case
afdc.
at
the
same
time,
the
secretary
since
1966
had
authorized
the
use
of
a
six
month
period
for
determining
the
spenddown,
a
period
which
was
not
tied
to
the
budget
period
of
the
underlying
programs.
obra
included
a
provision
aimed
at
giving
states
greater
latitude
in
defining
the
scope
of
their
medically
needy
programs.
the
secretary
interpreted
this
provision
broadly,
explaining
in
the
federal
register
that
states
are
no
longer
required
to
apply
a
uniform
methodology
for
treating
income
and
resources.
the
new
regulations
required
simply
that
the
methodologies
to
be
used
be
reasonable.
the
six
month
authorization
was
not
changed.
the
tefra
amendment
was
clearly
a
direct
response
to
these
changes.
the
amendment
was
part
of
a
section
headed
"technical
corrections
from
the
omnibus
budget
reconciliation
act
of
1981.
"
and
after
reviewing
the
enactment
of
obra
and
criticizing
the
secretary's
response
to
it,
the
house
commitee
report
stated:
"this
amendment
makes
clear
that
the
department
has
no
authority
to
alter
the
rules
that
applied
before
september
30,
1981,
with
respect
to
medically
needy
income
levels,
medically
needy
resource
standards,
and
the
methodology
for
treating
medically
needy
income
and
resources.
"
"the
committee
bill
reaffirms
the
financial
requirements
previously
in
effect
for
the
medically
needy.
"
and
at
that
point,
the
house
report
cites
specifically
the
secretary's
regulations
which
were
in
effect
prior
to
obra,
including
the
six
month
authorization.
mr.
h.
reed
witherby
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
now
that
i've
reviewed
the
context
of
the
1982
tefra
amendment
and
its
legislative
history,
the
question
is
what
lessons
there
are
to
be
learned
from
that
history.
the
first
lesson
is
that
congress'
use
of
the
term
tefra
in
direct
response
to
the
secretary's
use
of
the
term
in
the
new
1981
regulations
implementing
obra.
that
use
of
the
term
clearly
did
not
encompass
the
spenddown
or
the
length
of
the
budget
period.
this
is
a
strong
indication
that
congress'
use
of
the
term
"methodology"
also
did
not
include
or
encompass
those
subjects.
more
broadly,
the
dynamic
of
the
tefra
amendment
was
one
of
continuity,
not
of
change.
the
clearly
stated
congressional
purpose
was
to
correct,
to
undo
the
secretary's
1981
changes,
and
to
reinstate
the
pre-obra
regulatory
scheme.
in
that
scheme,
the
secretary
expressly
authorized
the
six
month
spenddown.
indeed,
congress
expressly
reaffirmed
the
financial
eligibility
regulations
which
were
in
effect
prior
to
obra,
including
specific
listing
of
those
regulations,
among
them
the
six
month
spenddown
authorization.
this
is
totally
inconsistent
with
the
respondent's
argument
that
it
was
congress'
intention
to
render
that
regulation
unlawful.
tefra
itself
describes
this
amendment
as
a
technical
correction.
the
imposition
of
a
one
month
spenddown
could
not
have
been
fairly
described
as
a
technical
correction.
it
would
have
been
a
dramatic
expansion
in
the
midst
of
a
cost-cutting
statute
of
the
scope
of
the
medically
needy
program
in
25
out
of
the
32
jurisdictions
that
participated
in
that
program.
the
six
month
spenddown
serves
an
important
role
in
the
medically
needy
program
in
the
state's
choice
to
focus
its
resources
in
the
medically
needy
program
upon
those
applicants
who
are
most
in
need.
congress
in
1982
had
no
intention
to,
and
did
not,
prohibit
this
widespread
and
important
practice.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
h.
reed
witherby
a
few
brief
points.
first,
the
delegation
of
authority
to
which
mr.
reixach
referred
in
his
argument,
which
was
withdrawn,
referred
to
an
entirely
different
determination.
and
the
legislative
history
of
the
1965
act
which
makes
that
clear
is
set
forth
in
my
reply
brief
starting
at
page
8.
the
delegation
of
authority
under
which
the
spenddown
regulation
was
issued
was
part
of
subsection
17
of
the
statute,
not
subsection
10,
which
is
where
the
delegation
mr.
reixach
referred
to
used
to
exist.
it
is
this
last
clause
of
section
17,
and
not
the
1982
amendment,
which
is
specifically
addressed
to
the
spenddown
determination.
with
respect
to
mr.
reixach's
suggestion
that
we
concede
that
prior
to
1981
states
had
leeway
to
use
any
period
they
wished
for
the
afdc
budget
periods,
that
is
incorrect.
we
do
not
concede
that,
and
the
house...
or,
excuse
me,
both
the
house
and
the
senate
reports
on
the
obra
legislation
which
contains
the
one
month
requirement
recognized
that
this
was
the
universal
practice
of
the
states
in
1981.
the
purpose
of
the
obra
legislation
regarding
afdc
was
a
cost
cutting
purpose
to
impose
retrospective
budgeting.
it
was
not
a
purpose
to
change
the
length
of
the
budget
period
for
afdc,
and
it
certainly
was
not
a
purpose
to
expand
the
medically
needy
program
by
requiring
a
similar
budget
period
there.
congress
was
clearly
aware
of
the
six
month
regulation,
which
they
expressly
referred
to
in
the
tefra
report,
and
they
were
clearly
paying
close
attention
to
the
financial
eligibility
regulations
of
the
secretary.
this
case
boils
down
to
a
simple
point:
when
congress
wants
a
one
month
period,
it
knows
how
to
say
so.
it
did
not
do
so
here.
