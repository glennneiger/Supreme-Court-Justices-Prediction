mr.
rene
h.
reixach,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
courts
below
correctly
construed
section
(a)(10)
of
the
medicaid
statute
as
invalidating
the
six
month
income
budgeting
policy
by
relying
on
its
clear
statutory
language
and
also
by
giving
some
secondary
meaning
to
the
legislative
history
and
the
events
surrounding
its
enactment.
both
the
trial
court
and
the
supreme
judicial
court
in
fact
in
doing
that
followed
the
three-part
analytical
framework
for
statutory
interpretation
set
forth
by
this
court
two
years
ago
in
the
chevron
case.
that
framework,
of
course,
is
first
to
look
at
the
language
of
the
statute;
next,
if
the
language
is
not
clear,
to
look
at
the
legislative
history;
and
finally,
as
a
third
step
and
only
if
the
first
two
steps
are
not
determinative,
to
look
at
the
views
of
the
agency
and
to
give
them
some
degree
of
deference.
the
problem,
we
submit,
with
the
argument
of
the
state
and
the
united
states
is
that
they
ignore
that
sequential
approach
and
in
fact
attempt
to
give
deference
to
the
views
of
the
secretary
at
stages
one
and
two
of
that
analysis,
where
no
such
deference
is
due.
moreover,
in
the
unique
circumstances
of
this
case,
where
the
secretary
once
had
a
delegation
of
legislative
authority
and
was
under
that
old
version
due
considerably
greater
deference
and
congress
withdrew
that
in
the
context
of
a
dispute
about
eligibility
for
medicaid,
the
views
of
the
secretary
are
in
this
unique
situation
entitled
to
no
deference.
let's
look
first
at
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
it
is
not
simply
about
a
methodology
in
some
sort
of
a
vacuum,
but
rather
about
determining
income
eligibility.
and
it
is
undisputed
that
income
eligibility
both
for
the
ssi
cash
program
and
for
the
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children
program
is
determined
monthly.
that
change
was
made
in
1981
and
in
many
ways
is
the
real
change
that
was
made
in
the
programs
here.
what
the
state
and
the
secretary
are
arguing
is
essentially
what
was
argued
unsuccessfully
by
the
respondents
in
the
case
of
schweiker
versus
hogan
several
terms
ago,
that
congress
didn't
understand
what
it
was
doing
when
it
enacted
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
and
here,
as
in
that
case,
that
simply
demeans
the
intelligence
of
congress,
and
the
court
should
not
interpret
a
statute
on
the
assumption
that
congress
didn't
know
what
it
was
doing.
let's
look
at
a
concrete
example.
under
the
cash
welfare
program,
somebody
can
apply
and
be
eligible
for
benefits
for
a
single
month.
if
their
financial
circumstances
improve,
they
will
be
ineligible
in
the
next
month.
but
they're
still
eligible
for
that
one
initial
month
of
application.
medicaid
for
the
medically
needy
is
different.
eligibility
for
a
single
month
in
massachusetts
under
the
six
month
regulation
is
impossible.
it's
six
months
or
nothing.
this
we
submit
really
demonstrates
the
problem
with
the
state's
whole
argument,
which
is
that
it
ignores
the
fact
that
income
always
has
a
time
component.
the
statute
is
about
determining
eligibility
based
on
income,
and
you
can't
talk
about
that
without
reference
to
time.
to
say
that
the
respondent
ms.
mckenna
had
$531.66
of
income
says
nothing
unless
you
know
whether
that
was
daily,
weekly,
monthly,
or
whatever.
now,
of
course,
at
this
stage
of
the
statutory
analysis
the
secretary
is
not
entitled
to
any
particular
deference.
this
makes
sense,
of
course,
because
otherwise
there
would
be
a
serious
separation
of
powers
problem.
in
almost
any
case,
a
clever
attorney
would
be
able
to
find
some
ambiguity
and
the
executive
branch
would
have
the
final
say
about
what
the
statute
means.
most
recently
that
policy
has
been
reiterated
in
the
american
citation
society
case
which
this
court
is
going
to
hear
on
the
last
day
of
the
term
on
other
grounds.
and
it's
in
this
respect
that
we
submit
that
the
second
circuit
in
its
de
jesus
versus
perales
case,
on
which
the
petitioners
rely,
erred.
in
that
case
the
court,
judge
friendly,
agreed
with
the
respondents
here
that
a
"literal
reading"
of
the
statute
supported
the
view
of
the
plaintiffs.
but
then
it
went
on
to
say,
we
are
nonetheless
going
to
defer
to
the
views
of
the
agency.
that
simply
we
submit
is
incorrect.
the
longstanding
nature
of
an
agency
policy
has
never
been
enough
to
justify
its
violating
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
particularly
where
there's
been
no
showing
that
congress
was
specifically
aware
of
the
policy
and
did
not
in
any
way
affirm
it.
now,
the
state
argues
at
some
length
that
the
statute
doesn't
apply
because
there
is
no
spenddown
in
the
cash
programs
and
therefore
they
say
it
can't
apply
in
the
medically
needy
program.
the
state's
argument
about
the
medically
needy
program,
and
it
was
reiterated
by
the
solicitor
general,
says
the
principal
difference,
in
fact,
they
say,
between
the
categorically
needy
and
the
plaintiffs
here,
respondents,
the
medically
needy,
is
the
existence
of
the
spenddown.
but
as
the
massachusetts
example
given
by
mr.
witherby
indicates,
that's
simply
not
true.
as
he
pointed
out,
there
are
many
medically
needy
individuals
who
in
massachusetts
have
no
spenddown
at
all.
what
we
submit
this
case
is
about
and
what
the
statute
is
about
is
the
determination
of
income,
and
under
all
of
the
programs,
cash
as
well
as
medicaid,
income
is
determined
ultimately
by
making
certain
deductions
from
gross
income,
coming
up
with
a
net
income
figure.
how
do
you
then
determine
eligibility?
well,
you
compare
that
net
income
figure
to
the
eligibility
level.
the
incurred
medical
expenses
that
are
deducted
in
the
medically
needy
program
are
simply
another
deduction,
and
that
deduction,
unique
to
the
medically
needy,
in
no
way
justifies
any
other
variance
from
the
way
that
the
cash
assistance
programs
otherwise
determine
eligibility.
the
basic
premise
of
the
medicaid
program
as
set
forth
clearly
in
section
(a)(10)
is
that
working
poor
people,
like
the
respondents,
should
not
be
treated
worse
than
their
counterparts
who
are
receiving
cash
welfare
benefits.
that's
what
the
state
is
doing
under
this
policy.
and
we
submit
that
eligibility
for
the
medically
needy
should
therefore
be
determined
in
all
other
respects,
including
the
length
of
time
that
you
determine
their
income,
the
same
way
as
it
is
in
the
cash
welfare
program.
now,
the
state
and
the
secretary
make
much,
or
attempt
to
make
much,
of
the
legislative
history
behind
this
enactment.
we
submit
that
the
legislative
history
in
fact
does
not
support
their
interpretation
and
indeed
supports
the
judgment
below.
what
happened...
and
it's
important
to
understand
the
scenario
of
events.
what
happened
was
that
in
1981
the
congress
repealed
the
delegation
of
legislative
authority
and
also
enacted
monthly
income
eligibility
budgeting
for
the
cash
welfare
programs.
and
it
appears
now
to
be
conceded,
albeit
sub
silentio,
by
the
petitioner
that
prior
to
1981
in
the
afdc
program
there
never
had
been
any
federally
mandated
budgeting
period.
states
could
have
used
whatever
period
they
wanted
to
determine
eligibility.
and
we
know
that
in
ssi
they
used
a
three
month
period.
so
prior
to
those
1981
changes,
this
regulation
of
the
secretary
made
some
sense.
it
accommodated
in
the
medically
needy
program
something
that
was
equivalent,
comparable,
if
you
will,
to
what
existed
in
the
cash
program,
that
was
three
months
eligibility
under
ssi,
and
also
took
into
account
the
special
three
month
retroactive
eligibility
that
was
available
under
medicaid.
after
the
1981
changes,
the
secretary
changed
his
regulations,
changed
many
of
them,
but
did
not
change
the
six
month
regulation.
in
fact,
if
you
look
that's
the
only
one
that
was
not
changed.
subsequently
in
1982,
congress,
after
having
told
the
secretary
repeatedly,
as
quickly
in
fact
as
six
days
after
the
regulations
came
out
in
1981,
congress
enacted
the
current
version
of
section
(a)(10).
now,
in
so
doing
they
made
a
statement
on
which
the
petitioner
relies,
which
has
to
be
read,
we
submit,
very
closely,
because
it
does
not
stand
for
the
proposition
that
they
would
like
it
to.
i'm
referring
to
the
statement
in
which
they
indicated
that,
in
a
one-house
report...
and
of
course,
being
a
report
of
only
one
house
it's
not
entitled
to
any
particular
degree
of
deference.
but
in
that
report--
mr.
rene
h.
reixach,
jr.
--it's
entitled
to
some
weight,
but
certainly
not
the
degree
of
controlling
weight
that
would
be
given
to
a
conference
report,
justice
rehnquist.
the
language,
as
i
point
out,
does
not
say
that
they're
reaffirming
the
regulation,
as
the
state
would
have
it.
rather,
what
it
says
is
that
they
are
reaffirming
the
financial
requirements,
whatever
those
might
be,
previously
in
effect.
and
then
in
a
parenthetical
it
gives
a
listing
of
regulations.
now,
if
you
recall
back
to
the
history
of
events
in
1981
leading
up
to
this,
the
six
month
regulation
at
issue
is
not
a
regulation
that
was
previously
in
effect.
it
had
always
been
in
effect,
and
it's
in
distinct
contrast
to
every
other
regulation
in
that
listing
in
that
regard.
so
it
didn't
need
to
be
reaffirmed
because
it
had
never
been
changed.
further--
mr.
rene
h.
reixach,
jr.
--there's
a
parenthetical
listing,
which
we
say
simply--
mr.
rene
h.
reixach,
jr.
--it
includes
this
provision.
but
we
say
what
that
does
is
really
give
you
boundary
markers
to
say,
this
is
the
area
in
which
to
look
to
find
the
particular
regulations
we're
talking
about.
but
for
example,
justice
stevens,
there
are
other
regulations
in
that
same
listing
which
are
subcaptioned
"financial
responsibility
of
relatives".
those
are
regulations
number
821
through
823.
those
were
not
even
issued
under
section
(a)(10),
the
section
that
congress
was
amending.
those
are
the
medically
needy
counterparts
to
the
regulations
which
this
court
construed
in
the
gray
panthers
case.
those
were
relative
responsibility
regulations
that
were
issued
under
an
entirely
different
section,
(a)(17).
now,
it
wouldn't
have
made
any
sense
for
congress
in
amending
section
(a)(10)
to
reaffirm
regulations
that
had
been
issued
under
an
entirely
different
section.
so
what
we're
saying
is--
mr.
rene
h.
reixach,
jr.
--well,
we
submit
that
it's
not,
because,
number
one,
they
didn't
say
they
were
approving
the
regulations.
they
were
talking
about
the
requirements
that
had
been
changed.
this
requirement
quite
singularly
had
not
been
changed.
and
if,
as
i
just
indicated,
if
they
were
intending
to
reaffirm
all
of
the
regulations,
it
was
kind
of
a
funny
way
to
go
about
it,
insofar
as
they
were
reaffirming
regulations
issued
under
an
entirely
different
statute.
we
suggest
that
means
they
were
simply
trying
to
show
you
where
the
regulations
could
be
found,
but
they
weren't
encompassing
all
of
them
in
that
group.
mr.
rene
h.
reixach,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
the
example
of
their
attempted
reaffirmation
of
regulations
issued
under
another
statute
indicates
that
it
was
perhaps
just
sloppy
wording.
mr.
rene
h.
reixach,
jr.
well,
your
honor--
mr.
rene
h.
reixach,
jr.
--of
course,
what
happened
here,
recall,
is
that
the
obra
changes,
the
changes
for
example
from
quarterly
budgeting
in
ssi
to
monthly
budgeting,
had
not
gone
into
effect...
that
particular
change
had
not
gone
into
effect
until
april
1,
1982.
the
amendment
to
section
(a)(10)
which
contains
the
disputed
language
was
enacted
in
july
and
august,
only
three
or
four
months
later.
there
clearly
had
not
been
a
focusing
on
this
issue
by
the
congress.
but
if
anything,
we
submit
that
that
simply
demonstrates
the
problem
with
their
argument.
they
really
argue
two
things
in
their
brief.
on
the
one
hand,
they
say
that
congress
wasn't
aware
of
this
regulation
and
obviously
didn't
intend
to
change
it.
then
they
take
precisely
the
opposite
point
of
view
and
say
that
in
fact
congress
intended
to
expressly
reaffirm
it.
we
submit
that
the
best
that
the
legislative
history
teaches
in
this
regard
at
all
is
that
congress
wanted
to
not
give
the
secretary
the
room
to
have
flexibility
as
she
previously
had
had.
they
took
the
prior
delegation
of
authority
and
withdrew
it,
and
they
also
used
considerably
more
specific
language.
rather
than
talking
about
comparable
standards,
which
is
a
somewhat
vague
phrase,
they
used
the
much
more
specific
phrase
"same".
what
congress
was
doing,
we
submit,
in
1981
was
making
the
whole
eligibility
process
for
all
of
the
programs
much
more
reality
specific,
if
you
will.
let's
look
at
the
ssi
program,
for
example,
which
previously
had
had
quarterly
budgeting.
under
that
program,
if
you
had
no
income
in
january
or
february,
but
came
into
income
in
march,
you
would
be
ineligible
because
of
that
march
income.
of
course,
that
didn't
help
you
pay
your
bills
in
january
of
february,
just
as
the
state's
policy
didn't
help
ms.
rivera
pay
her
bills
in
february
of
1983.
what
congress
did
when
it
changed
from
quarterly
budgeting
in
ssi,
when
in
mandated
one
month
budgeting
for
eligibility
in
afdc,
was
to
pin
those
programs
down
to
time
periods
that
in
fact
that
relevance
to
the
lives
of
the
people
who
were
affected
by
them.
people
pay
their
rent
and
their
utilities
on
a
monthly
basis,
and
that's
what
all
of
these
monthly
maintenance
allowances,
be
they
the
afdc
level
or
the
medically
needy
income
level,
are
supposed
to
do.
so
it's
quite
congruent,
we
think,
with
what
congress
was
doing
in
the
cash
welfare
programs,
what
they
did
here
in
the
medically
needy
program.
it
really
is
the
same
sort
of
underlying
policy,
and
can
result
in
some
of
the
same
results.
now,
the
state
and
the
secretary
also
argue
that
tefra
and
obra
were
cost
cutting
bills,
this
just
doesn't
make
any
sense.
i
think
the
example
i
just
gave
points
out
that
there
were
situations
where,
even
in
the
ssi
program,
eligibility
was
going
to
be
increased
somewhat.
the
only
actual
data
that
we
have
from
any
of
the
states,
other
than
just
sheer
speculation,
is
from
the
state
of
illinois,
which
did
make
a
change
from
six
month
to
one
month
budgeting
for
the
same
group
of
working
poor
people
as
are
involved
in
this
case.
and
over
a
two
year
period
where
there
was
about
a
10,
15
percent
increase
in
the
consumer
price
index
for
medical
expenditures,
they
had
only
a
2.5
percent
increase
in
their
medicaid
program.
also,
the
notion
that
obra
was
solely
cost
cutting
and
nothing
else
we
think
is
demonstrable
incorrect.
for
example,
in
section
955
of
the
budget
reconciliation
act,
there
is
a
whole
new
program
initiative
for
adolescent
family
life.
it
hadn't
existed
before
and
it
was
funded
at
$30
million
of
federal
money,
to
be
matched
by
other
sources.
so
there
were
in
fact
some
considerable
changes
that
were
made,
and
we
think
that
this
is
simply
one
of
them.
but
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
we
submit
supports
our
interpretation,
and
we
don't
think
that
the
secretary's
and
the
state's
version
of
the
legislative
history
really
supports
their
view
and
undercuts
the
plain
language.
mr.
rene
h.
reixach,
jr.
well,
that
was
his
statement,
your
honor.
i
think
the
example
that
i
gave
demonstrates
that,
if
that's
what
congress
said,
it
demonstrably
was
incorrect,
because
the
fact
is
that
under
the
old
ssi
program,
as
i
indicated,
if
you
had
income
in
the
last
month
of
the
quarter,
it
would
render
you
ineligible
for--
mr.
rene
h.
reixach,
jr.
--i'm
not
familiar
with
that
page
of
it,
your
honor.
mr.
rene
h.
reixach,
jr.
so
i
really
can't
speak
to
that.
but
we
do
believe
that
in
fact
the
changes
had
already
been
made.
and
in
fact,
since
one
month
budgeting,
as
i
indicated
earlier,
had
gone
into
effect
april
1
of
1982,
so
i
suppose
as
a
technical
matter
the
report
to
which
mr.
ganzfried
referred
is
in
fact
possibly
correct,
because
that
report
was
presumably
issued
in
july
or
august,
when
congress
was
considering
tefra.
the
changes,
the
change
to
one
month
budgeting,
had
been
completely
implemented
in
the
cash
programs
by
april
of
1982.
so
as
a
technical
matter,
i
suppose
that
there
might
not
have
been
any
perceived
programmatic
change
at
that
point,
because
one
month
budgeting
was
already
part
of
the
cash
program
by
then.
mr.
rene
h.
reixach,
jr.
yes.
mr.
rene
h.
reixach,
jr.
that
is
true.
but
i
don't
think
we
can
impute
to
congress
a
knowledge
of
what
each
of
the
50
states
is
doing.
nor,
i
might
point
out--
mr.
rene
h.
reixach,
jr.
--there
were
a
lot
of
states
that
did
it.
as
the
amicus
brief
of
the
gray
panthers
points
out,
there
are
many
major
states
that
did
not.
it
was
decidedly
a
mixture.
one
old
problem
in
this
area
of
what
one
is
to
make
of
the
secretary's
regulations
is
that,
quite
frankly,
in
this
whole
area
the
secretary
has
been
somewhat
less
than
forthcoming.
after
the
1982
enactments,
the
secretary
promulgated
regulations
purporting
to
implement
those
1982
changes.
and
with
reference
to
this
particular
section,
section
(a)(10),
the
secretary
said,
rather
cryptically,
that
the
statute
was
self
implimenting,
and
so
therefore
the
secretary
made
no
changes
in
the
regulations
which
even
the
united
states
and
the
state
would
concede
the
secretary
was
aiming
at.
those
regulations
have
now
remained
on
the
books
unchanged
for
three
and
a
half
years.
so
it
is
no
particular
surprise
that
congress,
unless
they
were
particular
cognoscenti
of
the
medicaid
program,
would
be
somewhat
left
in
the
dark
as
to
precisely
which
of
those
regulations
were
in
effect,
which
weren't,
how
they
had
been
changed,
because
the
secretary
has
just
said,
well,
it's
self-implementing
and
we
won't
tell
you
anything
more.
we
think
that
that
action
by
the
secretary
and
the
actions
taken
by
congress
indicate
really
why
in
this
particular
case
the
secretary
is
not
entitled
to
any
deference
at
all
in
construing
this
statute.
normally,
if
the
statute
were
clear
and
the
legislative
history
were
clear,
of
course,
you
wouldn't
go
to
that
third
step
of
the
analysis
and
look
to
the
views
of
the
agency
at
all.
mr.
rene
h.
reixach,
jr.
i
think
that
they
were
aware
that
they
were
changing
the...
they
were
certainly
aware
that
they
were
changing
the
cash
programs
in
1981.
mr.
rene
h.
reixach,
jr.
there
were
certainly
aware
in
1982,
and
based
on
the
legislative
history,
that
they
were
linking,
re-linking,
if
you
will,
the
medicaid
program
to
the
eligibility
determination
process
for
the
cash
programs.
so
we
think
that--
mr.
rene
h.
reixach,
jr.
--whether
they
were
aware
of
this
precise
issue,
i
can't
say
that
they
were,
justice
stevens.
but
we
think
that
the
statutory
enactments
over
that
short
span
of
time
demonstrate
that
that
was
the
inevitable
result,
and
congress
surely
must
have
know
that,
or
should
have
known
it.
we
also
submit
that
in
this
particular
case
that
the
views
of
the
secretary
are
not
due
any
deference.
the
reason
in
our
view
is
the
withdrawal
of
the
legislative
delegation
that
the
secretary
once
had
had.
under
the
prior
version
of
the
statute
as
it
existed
prior
to
1981,
the
secretary
had
that
extraordinary
deference.
that
was
withdrawn,
and
then
there
was
this
dispute
between
congress
and
the
secretary
over
the
secretary's
attempts
to
allow
medicaid
eligibility
to
be
computed
more
restrictively
than
eligibility
for
the
cash
welfare
program.
now,
just
the
year
before,
or
really
in
that
very
same
time
frame,
in
the
gray
panthers
case
this
court
in
1981
had
reiterated
what
the
effect
of
a
delegation
of
legislative
authority
was.
and
we
submit
that,
taken
in
that
entire
context,
where
the
delegation
was
withdrawn,
where
there
was
this
ongoing
dispute,
that
the
secretary
is
not
entitled
to
any
deference
at
all,
because
otherwise,
if
you
follow
through
the--
mr.
rene
h.
reixach,
jr.
--prior
to
1981,
justice
o'connor,
the
statute
had
language
in
it
in
section
(a)(10)
referring
to
eligibility
according
to
standards
promulgated
by
the
secretary.
and
we
know
that
that
reference
to
standards
promulgated
by
the
secretary
is
a
delegation
of
legislative
authority
to
the
secretary
to
a
wide
range
of
issue,
to
issue
regulations
which
are
going
to
be
virtually
unassailable
in
a
court.
in
1981
when
it
enacted
obra,
that
language
was
withdrawn
from
the
statute.
then
in
1982,
when
the
current
version
of
the
statute
was
enacted,
the
one
that
talks
about
the
same
methodology
for
determining
eligibility,
that
language
was
not
reinstated.
and
the
scenario
leading
up
to
that,
we
submit,
makes
it
quite
clear
why
it
wasn't,
because
congress
had
been
feuding
with
the
secretary
over
precisely
these
sorts
of
things
and
did
not
want
to
give
the
secretary
that
power.
it
didn't
use
the
old
language
of
comparability,
which
left
some
room
for
secretarial
interpretation,
but
rather
was
much
more
specific,
referring
to
doing
things
the
same.
the
so-called
spenddown,
as
i
indicated
at
the
outset
of
my
argument,
is
we
submit
really
simply
another
of
many
deductions
from
income,
and
the
fact
that
that
deduction
does
not
exist
in
the
cash
program
in
no
way
undermines
the
argument.
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
the
language
of
the
statute
on
which
the
secretary
relies,
section
(a)(17),
and
look
at
it
closely,
it's
apparent
that
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
eligibility
at
all.
what
it
has
to
do
with
is
defining,
allowing
the
secretary
to
define,
what
are
the
kinds
of
expenses
people
can
count.
can
they
count
a
bill
from
a
podiatrist
if
that
particular
state
doesn't
cover
podiatry?
the
secretary
has
issued
a
regulation
about
that.
you're
supposed
to
consider
all
bills
except
as
prescribed
by
the
secretary.
and
the
problem
of
the
respondents
here
and
in
the
other
cases
that
are
referred
to
on
this
issue,
de
jesus
and
hogan,
was
not
a
problem
of
not
having
enough
bills.
in
the
case
of
de
jesus
versus
pelales,
on
which
the
petitioner
relies
and
on
which
a
petition
for
certiorari
is
pending
in
this
court,
ms.
de
jesus
had
thousands
of
dollars
of
hospital
bills,
$750
of
income
each
month,
and
the
question
was,
was
she
going
to
have
to
pay
$150
toward
those
bills
or
$900,
six
times
that
amount?
mr.
rene
h.
reixach,
jr.
we
rely
on
changes
in
the
statutes
in
1981
and
in
1982.
mr.
rene
h.
reixach,
jr.
the
change
to
monthly
eligibility
in
1981.
mr.
rene
h.
reixach,
jr.
they
are,
your
honor.
mr.
rene
h.
reixach,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
our
argument
is
that
the
hogan
case
in
the
first
circuit
and
the
de
jesus
case
in
the
second
circuit
are
incorrect,
that
they
applied
the
wrong
analysis.
they
fell
into
the
trap
of
the
state
and
the
secretary,
as
i
indicated
earlier,
in
the
de
jesus
case,
for
example,
of
giving
deference
to
the
secretary,
although
judge
friendly
agreed
with
the
respondents
here
that
a
"literal
reading
of
the
statute"
supported
the
view
of
the
respondents
here.
and
we
submit
that
under
the
chevron
test,
if
there
is
a
literal
reading
of
the
statute
that
supports
the
respondents
that
should
be
the
end
of
the
matter,
and
that
these
inquiries
into
somewhat
murky
legislative
history
and
certainly
into
giving
deference
to
the
secretary
simply
are
not
supportable
under
the
analytical
framework
that's
required
to
determine
this;
and
that
in
fact
the
position
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
reflects
the
true
intent
of
congress
in
making
all
of
the
programs
reality
specific,
applying
them
on
a
monthly
basis,
because
that's
when
individuals
need
that
income
to
live
on,
to
pay
their
other
bills,
their
non-medical
bills.
and
that's
what
the
judgment
below
does.
so
in
summary,
we
submit
that
the
supreme
judicial
court
was
correct,
the
statute
is
clear
on
its
face,
the
secretary
is
not
entitled
to
any
deference
because
the
statute
is
clear,
and
because
the
delegation
of
legislative
authority
which
the
secretary
had
previously
had
was
withdrawn.
mr.
rene
h.
reixach,
jr.
in
order
to
rule
with
me,
i'm
afraid
you
might
have
to
do
that.
but
i
think
that
it
was
simply
due
to
a
misplacement
of...
a
mis-deference
to
the
secretary,
without
any
reference
to
the
analytical
framework
set
out
by
this
court.
thank
you.
