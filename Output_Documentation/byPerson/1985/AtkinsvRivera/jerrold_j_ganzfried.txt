mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
explain:
first,
why
the
secretary's
regulation
is
reasonable
and
should
be
upheld;
and
second,
why
this
court
should
reject
respondents'
efforts
to
change
the
medicaid
program
in
a
way
that
congress
has
expressly
rejected.
this
case
presents
a
classic
situation
where
the
manner
in
which
the
secretary
has
implemented
the
statute
should
prevail.
congress
delegated
broad
authority
to
the
secretary
in
this
complex
area,
so
his
regulations
are
entitled
to
legislative
effect.
in
addition,
this
case
presents
every
factor
pointing
to
the
conclusion
that
the
agency's
view
should
be
upheld.
the
subject
matter
is
technical
and
complex.
the
agency
has
longstanding
expertise
and
was
intimately
involved
in
the
drafting
and
consideration
of
the
medicaid
act.
following
enactment
of
the
statute,
the
agency
immediately
interpreted
it
in
the
way
that
is
now
being
challenged.
and
the
provision
permitting
the
six
month
spenddown
appeared
in
the
very
first
handbook
issued
under
secretary
gardener
in
1966
and
in
the
first
medicaid
regulations
issued
by
secretary
cohen
in
1969.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
it
was
not.
but
as
mr.
witherby
has
explained
and
we
explain
in
the
brief,
the
"same
methodology"
language
has
no
bearing
on
the
spenddown.
it's
quite
clear
that
congress
had
no
intention
for
it
to
affect
it.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
that's
ultimately
an
issue
that
we
get
to,
that's
right.
now,
in
getting
to
that
issue,
let
me
point
out
that
the
respondents
acknowledge
that
for
the
period
up
to
1981
at
least,
and
possibly
up
to
1982,
it
was
perfectly
lawful
for
the
secretary
to
permit
states
to
have
a
six
month
spenddown,
and
therefore
in
effect
they
concede
that
they
would
have
been
ineligible
for
medicaid
prior
to
obra.
their
argument,
in
addition
to
running
into
all
of
the
problems
that
mr.
witherby
has
addressed,
also
runs
directly
into
a
brick
wall
in
the
legislative
history
of
obra
itself.
the
house
conference
report,
in
describing
the
changes
in
1981,
said
that
nothing
would
allow
the
states
to
cover
individuals
not
covered
under
current
law.
that's
at
page
970
of
the
conference
report.
it's
not
cited
in
our
brief,
but
it
is
in
the
state's
brief.
and
that
i
submit
is
really
the
end
of
the
argument
on
the
"same
methodology"
which
would
be
required
under
the
appropriate
state
program
language.
now,
it
also
indicates,
as
does
the
legislative
history
of
the
technical
corrections
in
tefra,
that
congress
has
specifically
and
expressly
indicated
its
approval
of
the
secretary's
longstanding
regulations.
equally
as
important,
the
regulation
is
perfectly
reasonably
and
consistent
with
the
statutory
objectives.
the
medicaid
program
is
premised
on
congress's
desire
to
assure
that
the
most
needy
receive
assistance
in
paying
for
medical
care.
under
the
secretary's
regulation
as
implemented
in
massachusetts,
respondent
rivera
had
to
incur
$601
and
80
in
medical
expenses
during
a
six
month
period
in
order
to
qualify
for
medicaid
for
the
remainder
of
the
period.
she
claims
instead
that
she
should
have
qualified
after
her
medical
expenses
reached
$100.30.
but
it
cannot
seriously
be
questioned
that
with
the
same
two
people,
identical
in
all
relevant
respects
and
with
the
same
income,
the
one
who
has
medical
bills
of
$600
is
more
needy
than
the
one
who
has
medical
bills
of
only
$100.
the
statute's
aim
is
to
provide
benefits
to
those
with
the
greatest
need,
and
the
regulation
at
issue
here
serves
that
purpose.
now,
i've
addressed
some
of
the
legislative
history
that
indicates
why
the
respondents'
argument
is
incorrect
with
respect
to
the
1981
and
1982
amendments.
i
would
also
like
to
mention
briefly,
as
we
discuss
in
greater
detail
in
our
brief,
why
respondents'
view
makes
no
sense
even
on
the
face
of
those
amendments.
the
basic
distinction
between
the
medically
needy
and
the
categorically
needy
is
that
the
medically
needy
have
excess
income,
income
above
the
state's
level
of
need.
since
spenddown
refers
exclusively
to
excess
income,
it
has
no
application
whatever
to
the
categorically
needy
and
no
counterpart
in
the
cash
assistance
programs.
why?
because
the
categorically
needy
by
definition
have
no
excess
income.
to
put
it
another
way,
insofar
as
this
case
is
concerned,
categorically
needy
eligibility
is
based
solely
on
income.
after
failing
to
qualify
on
that
basis,
the
medically
needy
are
given
a
second
chance
based
on
their
medical
expenses.
spenddown
refers
to
expenses,
and
it
therefore
has
no
counterpart
in
the
cash
programs,
where
medical
expenses
play
no
role
in
eligibility.
in
short,
there
is
nothing
comparable
in
the
cash
program
that
can
be
transported
into
this
context
as
the
"same
methodology"
which
would
be
employed
to
the
medicaid
medically
needy
program.
in
light
of
the
difficulties
that
the
respondents
have
with
the
language
in
the
statute
as
amended,
and
in
light
of
the
fact
that
the
legislative
history
demonstrates
that
congress
had
no
intent
to
do
what
the
respondents
argue
and
the
court
below
held,
and
in
fact
specifically
reaffirmed
the
regulation
that
had
been
in
existence
for
at
that
point
17
years,
now
about
20
years,
it
is
our
position
that
you
can't
ask
for
a
clearer
indication
that
congress
agrees
with
the
spenddown
approach
taken
by
every
secretary
since
medicaid
began.
congress
delegated
to
the
secretary
the
difficult
and
complex
task
of
deciding
how
the
limited
resources
available
for
medical
assistance
can
most
effectively
reach
those
most
in
need.
the
spenddown
regulation
accomplishes
that
purpose
in
a
way
that
congress
has
never
changed,
and
indeed
has
expressly
approved.
accordingly,
we
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
should
be
reversed.
thank
you.
