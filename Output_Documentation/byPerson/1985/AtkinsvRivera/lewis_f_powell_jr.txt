justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
interrupt
you
just
long
enough
to
ask
this
question.
you
rely,
as
i
understand
it,
on
the
change
in
the
statute
in
1982,
is
that
correct?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
right.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
let
me
just
follow
up.
both
the
courts
of
appeals
for
the
first
and
second
circuits
decided
cases
in
1985,
after
those
changes
were
made,
and
they
decided
cases
that
seem
on
the
face
of
them
against
your
position.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
i
wondered
what
your
argument
is.
