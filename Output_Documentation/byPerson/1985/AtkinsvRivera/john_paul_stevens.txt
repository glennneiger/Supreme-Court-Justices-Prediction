justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
isn't
it
true
that
the
"same
methodology"
language
wasn't
in
the
statute
at
that
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
that's
really
the
issue,
isn't
it,
whether
the
"same
methodology"
language
has
bearing
on
the
spenddown?
isn't
that
really
what
we're
supposed
to
decide?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
stop
you
there.
i
don't
understand
that
argument.
it
is
listed
in
the
things
that
they
say
are...
i
guess,
could
you
give
me
the
part
of
your
argument
again?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
includes
this
provision.
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
they
shouldn't
have
referred
to
that
statute.
but
isn't
it
a
fair
reading
of
that
parenthetical
that
they
intended,
at
least
in
a
general
way,
to
approve
everything
listed
in
the
parenthetical?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
couldn't
one
also
make
the
contrary
argument,
that
if
they
generally
thought
everything
should
be
done
on
a
one
month
basis
and
they
listed
a
regulation
that
authorized
a
six
month
period
for
determining,
how
can
you
say
they're
disapproving
the
six
month
rule?
i
mean,
somehow
that
doesn't
fit
either.
justice
john
paul
stevens
see,
because
your
view,
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
is
that
one
month
should
apply
to
everything.
and
this
is
a
very
unique,
kind
of
flagrant
exception.
and
you
would
think
that
if
they
thought
this
was
wrong,
when
it's
that
dramatic,
they
might
have
made
just
the
contrary
comment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
i
missed
something.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
one
other
question
about
the
legislative
history.
i
think
mr.
ganzfried
referred
to
something
in
the
conference
report
that
said
in
so
many
words
that
this
would
not
put
anybody
on
the
roles
who
was
not
already
eligible.
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
you've
given
me
a
hypothetical
that
that
wouldn't
fit.
do
you
agree
that
that's
a
correct
statement
of
what
the
conference
report
says?
i
had
missed
that,
frankly,
in
the
briefs.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
didn't
find
it
in
his
brief,
either.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
wasn't
part
of
it
for
your
clients.
for
the
cash
programs,
yes--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
not
for
the
medically
needy
people.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
congress
must
have
known
that
there
were
states
that
did
use
the
six
month
period
for
medically
needy
eligibility,
didn't
they?
a
lot
of
states
did
this,
as
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
interrupt
once
more.
i
must
confess
i
detect
a
little
tension
in
your
argument.
i'm
not
clear
on
whether
you're
saying
that
congress
was
clearly
aware
of
the
six
month
regulation
and
wanted
to
change
it
by
adopting
the
"same
methodology"
language,
or
they
weren't
aware
of
it
and
it's
just
kind
of
an
inevitable
consequence
of
this
language.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
no
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
still
haven't
told
me
whether
you
think
they're
aware
of
the
issue
in
this
case.
