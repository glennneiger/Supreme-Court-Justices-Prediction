mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize
both
what
the
city
of
berkeley
did
and
what
it
did
not
do
in
this
case.
it
enacted
an
ordinance
by
popular
initiative
which
set
a
citywide
cap
on
rent
increases,
a
vertical
restriction,
obviously,
by
government.
and
it
told
elected
public
officials
that
they
could
adjust
that
cap
upward
to
reflect
costs
to
landlords.
it
did
not...
and
i
think
this
is
crucial
in
comparing
the
case,
for
example,
to
midcal,
about
which
the
court
has
been
told
today.
it
did
not
empower
any
private
groups
to
set
rents
or
to
set
prices
of
any
kind.
unlike
midcal
and
goldfarb
and
schwegman,
there
is
here
no
allegation,
no
proof
whatever,
of
any
discrimination,
favoritism,
collusion,
conflict
of
interest,
of
the
sort
that
we
argue
in
part
1(d)
of
our
brief
could,
in
light
of
this
court's
decisions
in
lafayette
and
boulder,
create
an
antitrust
problem
for
municipal
officials
and
for
cities.
it
did
not,
in
sharp
contrast
to
lafayette
and
town
of
hallie
and
the
jefferson
case
in
this
court,
it
did
not
use
its
economic
leverage
over
any
good
or
service...
sewage
or
electricity
or
water...
in
order
to
gain
or
confirm
monopoly
power
or
special
privilege.
indeed,
until
today,
when
we
were
told
that
the
city,
with
one
third
of
one
percent
even
at
the
most
optimistic
projection
of
the
housing,
might
genuinely
be
a
monopolist,
i
had
thought
that
that
argument
had
mercifully
left
this
case.
surely
it's
not
a
serious
argument.
the
question
then
becomes,
what
do
the
lafayette
and
boulder
decisions
mean
for
an
ordinance
of
this
kind?
and
on
this
it
seems
to
me
that
the
appellants
are
quite
elusive.
we
believe
that
they
leave
this
ordinance
untouched,
because
we
believe
that
there
is
neither
monopolization
nor
any
combination
or
conspiracy
that
unreasonably
restrains
trade.
and
what
we
are
told
is
that
there
is
nonetheless
some
emanation,
some
policy
from
the
sherman
act,
a
pro-competitive
policy,
against
which
this
ordinance
cuts.
but
i
think
nothing
could
be
clearer
in
this
court's
decisions
than
that
when
one
is
dealing
with
so
nebulous
a
federal
policy,
the
preemptive
power
of
congress
would
gobble
up
state
and
local
authority
at
once
if
it
was
enough
to
show
that
there
was
something
anticompetitive
about
a
measure.
justice
stevens'
opinion
for
this
court
in
exxon
against
maryland
made
clear:
"if
an
adverse
effect
on
competition
were
in
and
of
itself
enough
to
render
a
state
statute
invalid,
the
power
of
the
states
to
engage
in
economic
regulation
would
be
destroyed.
"
justice
rehnquist's
opinion
in
rice
v.
williams
is
to
the
same
effect.
so
i
think
justice
white's
standard
is
the
only
tolerable
one:
is
it
the
case
that
this
law
orders
conduct
that
the
sherman
act
forbids?
and
i
think
that
the
answer
to
that
question
has
to
be
no
unless
one's
concept
of
combination
or
conspiracy
is
so
extraordinary
as
to
encompass
literally
any
restriction
that
is
imposed.
for
example--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--justice
white,
in
this
court's
opinion
in
rice
v.
williams,
which
came
from
the
california
court
of
appeals,
that
issue
was
raised
in
footnote
4
and
it
was
observed
that,
although
the
california
courts
would
not
have
jurisdiction
to
entertain
a
lawsuit
brought
to
enforce
the
sherman
act,
nonetheless
when
the
remedy
sought
under
the
supremacy
clause
is
declaratory
or
injunctive,
it
is
appropriate
to
ask
whether
because
of
direct
conflict
with
the
mandate
of
the
sherman
act
there
is
preemption.
and
indeed,
it
was
in
that
opinion
and
for
this
court
that
justice
rehnquist
suggested
that
a
facial
attack
upon
a
law
for
conflict
with
the
sherman
act,
because
of
the
breadth
of
its
pro-competitive
goals,
requires
more
than
a
showing
that
there's
something
anti-competitive
about
the
measure.
it
requires
a
showing
that
there
is
in
fact
a
direct
violation,
though
the
remedial
powers
of
the
state
courts
would
be
limited.
when
i
was
listening
earlier
today
to
the
argument
in
the
penton
case,
it
struck
me
that
that
would
be
a
perfect
example
of
how
unacceptable
the
contrary
theory
would
be.
in
that
case,
this
court
heard
a
first
amendment
attack
on
an
evenhanded
neutral
general
ordinance
that
restricts
competition.
it
was
a
first
amendment
attack,
not
a
sherman
act
attack.
but
obviously
the
law
restricts
competition
and
the
city
didn't
justify
it
by
any
pro-competitive
effect,
rather
by
its
concern
with
the
public
welfare,
transients
and
the
like.
yet,
obviously
it
prevents
people
from
competing
with
adult
fare,
competing
with
that
fare
with
the
general
fare
that
is
offered
in
the
city.
i
would
submit
that,
even
if
they
tried
to
regulate
the
prices
that
adult
theaters
could
charge...
suppose
they
said
that
seattle
has
had
a
problem,
adult
theaters
have
cheap
shows
during
the
late
afternoon
in
happy
hour,
and
we're
going
to
put
a
cap
on
those
prices.
that
would
be
price-fixing,
vertically,
by
government.
i
would
think
that
a
preemption
attack
should
be
rejected.
but
contrast
that
with
midcal.
that
is,
suppose
the
town
of
penton
allowed
private
owners
of
general
fare
theaters
to
get
together
and
exclude
competition
from
nearby
adult
theaters
or
to
restrict
competition
by
requiring
that
they
charge
at
least
as
much
as
the
prices
of
the
ordinary
theaters.
that
would
be
preempted.
it
would
be
a
combination
in
restraint
of
trade,
and
it
couldn't
be
ratified
even
by
state
legislation
because,
although
the
state
is
exempt,
it
cannot,
as
this
court
held
in
schwegman
and
goldfarb
and
midcal,
give
a
green
light
to
private
combinations.
and
when
we
are
told
by
mr.
smock
that
that's
what
this
law
does
because
it
places,
as
he
put
it,
irresistible
pressure
on
landlords
to
coalesce
and
combine,
then
we
suppose
that
he's
talking
metaphorically.
they
do
not
coalesce
and
combine;
they
follow
in
lockstep
the
mandated
price
cap
unless
they
in
public
hearing
show
that
they
are
entitled
to
a
special
increase.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we
keep
that
in
mind
there
is
here
neither
a
vertical
combination
between
the
city
and
those
that
it
has
the
power
of
law
to
coerce
to
follow
these
prices,
nor
a
holding
combination
among
private
parties
mandated,
encouraged,
or
authorized
by
the
city.
as
far
as
the
vertical
combination
was
concerned,
i
think
the
copper
weld
opinion
of
the
chief
justice
is
directly
apposite.
just
as
it
is
nonsensical
to
talk
about
a
conspiracy
between
a
parent
and
its
wholly
owned
subsidiary
when
the
parent
can
tell
the
subsidiary
what
to
do,
so
to
use
the
language
of
combination
in
the
sherman
act
to
say
that
there
is
some
kind
of
combination
between
the
city
of
berkeley
and
the
landlords
who
are
directed
by
the
city
not
to
increase
their
rents
faster
than
a
certain
publicly
mandated
rate
we
think
makes
a
mockery
of
the
language
and
of
the
sherman
act.
and
we
think
that
any
contrary
view
would
lead
to
truly
absurd
results.
suppose
the
city
wants
to
tell
ambulance
services
that
they
must
not
charge
more
than
a
certain
amount
for
emergencies.
that
then
becomes
a
vertical
combination
between
the
city
and
the
ambulances.
if
the
city
tells
parking
garages
that
they
must
charge
at
least
a
certain
floor,
that
becomes
a
vertical
combination
with
the
parking
garages.
if
it
tells
taxi
drivers
that
they
can't
charge
any
more
than
a
certain
ceiling,
that's
a
vertical
combination.
we
don't
think
that
can
be
what
the
sherman
act
conceivably
meant,
and
we
think
therefore
that
there
is
in
this
case
quite
manifestly
no
contract,
combination,
or
conspiracy
in
restraint
of
trade,
unless
one
is
to
say
that
the
social
contract
itself
by
which
all
are
bound
to
obey
the
law
is
a
contract
in
restraint
of
trade.
we
don't
think
that
that
is
what
the
congress
in
1890
meant.
but
let
me
ask
the
question
whether
the
congress
in
its
more
recent
speaking
to
this
subject
in
1984
in
the
local
government
antitrust
act
worked
any
change
in
the
law,
because
i
detected
some
evasion,
i
think,
in
response
to
justice
stevens'
question.
but
as
i
get
it,
their
theory
is
that
congress
in
1984
declined
to
provide
a
complete
exemption
to
municipalities
under
the
antitrust
laws.
that
is,
it
declined
to
overrule
or
to
reverse
the
impact
of
boulder.
and
therefore
we
are
asking,
supposedly,
of
this
court
what
congress
refused
to
give.
in
fact,
it's
absolutely
clear,
i
think,
that
we
are
not
asking
for
an
absolute
exemption
or
complete
immunity
for
municipalities
or
their
officials.
we
argue
in
some
detail,
citing
cases
from
a
great
many
lower
courts
in
footnote
55
of
our
brief,
that
it
is
entirely
possible,
when
one
alleges
and
shows
some
combination
between
public
officials
and
favored
companies
or
franchisees,
as
in
the
houston
cable
case
that
has
been
pending
on
certiorari
in
this
court
since
last
december,
entirely
possible
to
meet
the
requirements
of
the
sherman
act.
indeed,
the
language
that
mr.
smock
quoted
from
house
report
98-965
i
think
well
states
our
position.
he
quoted:
"if
congress
were
confident
that
the
actions
of
local
governments
and
their
officials
were
always
in
the
public
interest
or
would
never
work
unnecessary
anticompetitive
injury,
it
would
simply
exclude
them
from
the
application
of
the
antitrust
laws.
"
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
if
there
were
proof
of
a
combination
other
than
the
ordinary
lobbying
effort
by
tenants...
that
is,
some
claim
perhaps
that
tenants--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
if
you
couldn't
prove
it
i
would
think
that
the
noehr-pennington
doctrine
would
require
that
one
respect
the
right
of
any
group
in
the
society...
tenants,
landlords...
to
organize
for
a
political
purpose.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
they
were
all
elected
at
large,
justice
white.
and
i
think
that
in
the
chief
justice's
city
of
eastlake
opinion
an
important
distinction
was
drawn
between
delegating
power
to
some
narrow
private
sector
of
the
economy
and
passing
an
initiative
measure,
which
after
all
this
was.
and
it's
noteworthy
that
mr.
smock
does
not
press
the
claim
that
one
could
somehow
find
a
conspiracy
between
those
who
won
in
the
political
process...
and
they
weren't
all
tenants;
they
were
tenants
and
landlords
who
both
voted
for
this
measure...
and
somehow
the
polity
as
an
entirety.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no.
no,
justice
rehnquist.
i'm
sorry
if
i
gave
that
impression.
i
don't
think
the
case
would
be
weaker.
i
think
the
dramatic
effect
of
their
position
might
be
a
little
less
obvious,
but
the
legal
position
would
be
absolutely
identical.
it
doesn't
matter
what
the
identity
of
these
individuals
is.
but
let
me
turn
back
for
a
moment,
if
i
might,
to
the
house
report,
because
it
directly
belies,
i
think,
the
argument
made
by
my
colleague
for
the
appellants
two
pages
before
the
quotation
that
he
reads.
footnotes
24
and
25
of
the
report
are
very
explicit:
"it
should
be
noted
that
the
ruling
in
professional
engineers.
"
--which
suggested
that
only
pro-competitive
policy
could
be
educed
to
support
an
anti-competitive
measure...
"does
not
necessarily
stand
for
the
broader
proposition
that
private
persons
and
local
governments
should
be
treated
exactly
the
same
for
purposes
of
antitrust
analysis.
"
and
indeed,
in
footnote
25
the
point
is
made
that:
"lower
courts
are
already
fashioning
special
tests
for
dealing
with
local
government
action
under
the
antitrust
laws
in
the
face
of
boulder.
"
and
in
the
portion
of
this
report
that
we
quote
in
our
brief,
the
house
is
clear
that
it
expects
those
judicial
decisions
to
continue.
so
that
all
the
congress
declined
to
do
was
to
confer
blanket
immunity,
in
the
face
of
possible
corruption,
possible
favoritism,
possible
combinations,
to
confer
blanket
immunity
on
municipalities.
nor
do
we
urge
such
blanket
immunity.
we
merely
argue
that
when
this
court
in
boulder
lowered
the
shield
of
state
action
exemption
from
municipalities
it
should
not
therefore
be
deemed
also
to
have
given
their
opponents
the
kind
of
blunderbuss
ammunition
that
is
unavailable
even
against
private
wrongdoers.
that
is,
general
motors
or
it&t
are
free
to
order
their
economic
affairs
so
long
as
they
do
not
violate
the
antitrust
laws.
the
suggestion
that
cities
should
be
less
free,
should
always
have
to
act
only
with
competition
in
mind,
despite
their
very
different
public
purposes,
we
think
is
untenable.
and
indeed,
if
i
might
turn
to
boulder
itself,
this
court
in
boulder
said
that
it
was
holding
only
that
the
state's
subdivisions
in
exercising
their
delegated
power
must
obey
the
antitrust
laws,
not
that
they
must
always
put
competition
in
a
market,
however
exploitative,
however
incapable
of
meeting
the
diverse
housing
needs
of
the
people,
above
all
other
goals.
now,
apart
from
the
decisive
absence
of
any
combination
or
monopolization
and
therefore
any
section
1
or
section
2
violation
of
the
threshold,
we
do
elaborate
in
our
brief
the
further
argument,
to
which
i
haven't
heard
any
response
by
<mister>
[=
mr.]
smock...
i
think
it's
a
rather
important
argument...
the
argument
that
even
if
there
were
the
requisite
combination
or
even
if
that
were
deemed
merely
a
technicality
that
this
court
could
somehow
overlook,
the
usual
per
se
rule
for
private
price-fixing
is
inappropriate
in
dealing
with
local
government
regulation
of
the
economy,
as
the
california
supreme
court
held.
the
reason
quite
simply
is,
as
this
court
recognized
in
town
of
hallie,
the
assumption
that
private
enterprise
will
be
modified,
will
be
motivated
by
private
profit
and
not
by
the
public
good
is
inappropriate
in
dealing
with
municipalities.
the
situation
of
municipal
action
is
qualitatively
different,
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
said,
all
the
way
back
in
white
motor
in
1963
and
as
recently
as
northwest
stationers
just
this
year,
that
one
cannot
mechanically
extrapolate
per
se
rules
just
by
using
seemingly
similar
labels.
now,
if
i'm
right
that
the
existing
per
se
rule
about
private
price-fixing
is
unavailable
to
mechanically
strike
down
this
kind
of
ordinance,
then
there's
a
very
important
implication.
the
implication
is
one
cannot
strike
it
down
on
its
face.
as
this
court
held
in
rice
v.
williams,
to
strike
down
a
law
on
its
face
under
the
antitrust
laws,
despite
all
the
myriad
applications
it
might
have,
one
needs
to
have
a
clear
enough
per
se
rule
to
be
able
to
say
that
in
all
of
its
applications
with
confidence
its
anticompetitive
effects
will
not
be
justified
by
the
legitimate
range
of
benefits
one
might
consider.
what
that
in
turn
means
is
that
it's
only
after
a
series
of
as-applied
attacks
to
laws
of
this
kind
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
formulate
the
per
se
rule
without
which
facial
invalidation
is
unacceptable.
now,
such
as-applied
attacks
might
occur.
i
trust
that
if
this
court
reaffirms
boulder,
says
that
there
is
no
blanket
exemption
for
municipalities,
it
will
nonetheless
have
room,
as
the
fifth
circuit
did
in
the
affiliated
capital
corporations
case
involving
favoritism
to
certain
cable
companies,
friends
of
the
mayor,
it
will
have
room
to
entertain
case
by
case
particular
instances
of
anticompetitive
municipal
behavior.
and
after
a
time
one
might
formulate
for
those
situations
appropriate
per
se
rules,
let's
say
a
rule
requiring
competitive
bidding
across
a
broad
range
of
cases,
but
only
after
a
series
of
as-applied
challenges.
we
have
here
a
facial
challenge
that
is
not
only
a
challenge
bereft
of
conspiracy,
but
a
challenge
bereft
of
any
showing
of
unreasonableness.
but
it
seems
to
us
that
the
judgment
below
must
in
any
event,
even
if
we
were
wrong
completely
about
conspiracy
and
wrong
about
the
per
se
rules,
it
must
in
any
event
be
affirmed,
because
the
city
of
berkeley,
contrary
to
what
you
heard
from
mr.
smock,
is
in
no
sense
serving
a
purely
parochial
interest
of
its
own
in
passing
this
ordinance.
of
course
it
is
concerned
with
its
own
citizens,
with
the
aged,
with
students,
with
the
disabled,
with
people
who
might
otherwise
be
vindictively
evicted
from
their
apartments.
but
it
is
concerned,
as
it
said
in
the
very
preamble
to
the
ordinance,
it's
concerned
with
these
things
in
order
to
discharge
its
duty
under
state
law
to
make
sure
that
every
segment
of
the
community
is
adequately
housed.
now,
i
think
this
court
was
misled
by
mr.
smock
when
he
said
that
that
duty
was
created
in
1980.
surely,
as
justice
rehnquist
suggests,
even
if
it
was
it
would
be
competent
for
the
legislature
to
ratify
retrospectively
what
the
city
had
done.
but
the
fact
is
that
the
relevant
language
giving
every
municipality
in
california
an
obligation
somehow
adequately
to
ensure
that
its
people
are
housed,
that
language
goes
back
to
section
65302
of
the
government
code,
enacted
in
1967.
it's
been
repeatedly
amended,
but
the
critical
language
has
not
been
materially
changed.
now,
that's
five
years
before
the
originally
version
of
this
ordinance
was
passed
in
1972,
and
when
that
original
version
was
passed
in
order
to
discharge
this
state-created
obligation
both
houses
of
the
california
legislature
ratified
what
the
city
of
berkeley
had
done
in
that
earlier
version
of
this
law.
now,
it
is
said
in
the
appellants'
brief
that
this
court
should
disregard
that
ratification
because
the
state
legislature
just
did
it
absent-mindedly,
mechanically;
they
ratified
everything.
but
surely
principles
of
federalism
mean
that
one
cannot
disregard
a
legislative
act
of
two
houses
of
the
state
legislature
on
the
ground
that
it's
something
that
one
would
have
automatically
expected.
in
any
event--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
it's
a
development
and
housing
requirement,
and
it's
somewhat
ambiguous
as
to
the
kinds
of
elements
that
must
be
included
in
the
so-called
housing
element
of
the
plan.
but
the
legislature
itself
i
think
has
made
clear
it's
understanding
of
the
breadth
of
this
law,
because
in
1980
when
the
law
was
again
being
considered,
it
was
considered
at
the
same
time
as
the
california
electorate
was
being
asked...
and
it
was
called
proposition
10...
to
cut
back
on
the
rent
control
power
of
municipalities,
power
that
the
state's
highest
court
said
that
they
had
inherently
under
the
home
rule
authority
as
of
1976
when
the
berkenfeld
decision
was
rendered.
so
in
1980
the
people
of
california
are
asked
in
prop
10
to
take
back
that
power.
while
proposition
10
was
pending,
the
state
legislature,
in
passing
technical
amendments
to
the
planning
provisions
which
as
of
1967
had
imposed
these
duties
upon
the
municipalities,
explicitly
said
in
section
65589,
to
protect
the
state's
law,
as
i
would
understand
it,
from
the
possibility
that
proposition
10
might
pass,
said
that
nothing
in
this
planning
law
shall
be
construed
to
either
add
to
or
subtract
from
the
rent
control
authorities
of
cities.
in
other
words,
the
legislature
was
recognizing
that
such
authority
already
existed.
if
it
should
be
removed
by
proposition
10,
then
it
was
not
meant
by
the
legislature
that
this
planting
obligation
would
mandate
rent
control.
but
the
legislature
has
been
clear
for
a
long
time
that
it's
up
to
each
municipality
whether
to
meet
the
housing
needs
of
all
sectors
of
the
economy
and
the
population
by
rent
control
or
in
some
other
way.
in
that
sense,
the
case
is
on
all
fours
with
town
of
hallie.
that
is,
here,
as
in
town
of
hallie,
the
city
of
berkeley
is
left
free
either
to
take
this
specific
kind
of,
if
you
want
to
call
it,
anticompetitive
measure,
although
we
think
its
net
impact
on
competition
has
never
been
demonstrated,
either
it
may
take
that
measure
or,
if
it
doesn't,
it
must
do
something
else
to
assure
that
the
housing
need
of
the
people
are
met.
the
foreseeability
test
of
town
of
hallie
does
not
require
that
the
state
direct
municipalities
as
to
the
choice
of
means,
and
when
the
rent
control
method
was
ratified
by
the
legislature
when
first
used
in
1972,
when
the
state's
highest
court
four
years
later
said
you
don't
even
need
to
ratify
it
because
it's
one
of
the
general
powers
of
a
municipality,
and
when
four
years
later
the
state
legislature
acknowledges
expressly
that
this
is
one
of
the
municipality's
means
by
which
it
may
meet
a
state-created
duty
that
goes
all
the
way
back
to
1967,
it
seems
to
me
entirely
foreseeable
and
therefore
state-authorized.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
right,
berkenfeld
by
itself
wouldn't
do.
but
as
part
of
this
chronological
chain,
it
shows
complete
foreseeability.
but
the
dramatic
effect
of
the
appellants'
argument
is
that
not
even
explicit
state
authorization
would
save
local
zoning,
local
rent
control,
local
economic
regulation,
if
their
theory
were
right,
because
after
all,
as
they
themselves
point
out,
schwegman
and
goldfarb
and
midcal
all
were
cases
where
there
was
direct
state
authorization.
and
if
one
could
analyze
as
a
vertical
mandate
by
obscure
analogy
to
the
resale
maintenance
cases,
one
could
analyze
any
economic
regulation
telling
private
parties
how
to
behave
in
the
economy
to
an
irreconcilable
and
irresistible
pressure
to
coalesce
and
combine,
then
it
would
follow
that
no
amount
of
explicit
state
authorization
could
save
rent
control,
could
save
any
local
control
of
the
economy.
now,
the
sherman
act,
passed
in
1890,
cannot
have
had
that
intention.
and
when
congress
in
1984
declined
to
provide
complete
immunity
from
sherman
act
violations
to
municipalities
and
municipal
officers,
it
cannot
have
suddenly
done
what
the
congress
in
1890
failed
to
do.
so
for
three
completely
independent
grounds,
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
california
we
think
is
correct.
it's
correct
because
there
is
no
conceivable
combination
or
conspiracy
in
restraint
of
trade
here.
it's
correct
because
there
is
no
facial
showing
under
an
appropriately
available
per
se
rule
that
any
restraint
that
might
exist
is
unreasonable
in
light
of
the
legitimate
public
purposes
that
it
serves.
and
it's
correct
because,
even
if
there
were
an
antitrust
violation,
it
is
a
violation
so
obviously
foreseeable
by
the
entire
legislative
scheme
of
the
state
of
california
that
unless
this
court
were
to
overrule
its
recent
unanimous
decision
in
town
of
hallie,
the
decision
below
would
have
to
be
affirmed.
thank
you
very
much.
