justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
it
briefed
to
the
california
supreme
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
your
criticism
of
the
supreme
court
of
california
that
it
failed
to
find
this
act
on
its
own?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
smock,
you
said
just
before
lunch
that,
since
whatever
california
legislation
that
the
city
of
berkeley
relied
upon
had
been
passed
after
the
city
of
berkeley's
ordinance,
it
was
no
good.
do
you
say
that
the
state
could
never
ratify
something
that
a
municipality
had
done?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
have
to
find
that
there
is
a
violation
before
you
can
find
a
preemption?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
think
you've
been
completely
clear,
at
least
not
to
my
mind,
in
deciding
whether
you
have
to
say
that
the
city
of
berkeley
would
be
liable
in
a
suit
under
the
antitrust
act
in
order
to
find
that
the
ordinance
is
invalid
because
of
conflict
with
the
sherman
act.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
are
there
circumstances
in
which
that
action
would
not
be
successful
and
still
a
court
could
properly
say
that
the
berkeley
ordinance
is
preempted
or
in
some
way
forbidden
by
the
antitrust
laws?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
your
case
would
be
weaker...
and
i
thought
i
got
this
from
your
recent
answer
to
justice
white...
if
say
four
of
the
seven
members
of
the
berkeley
city
council
were
tenants?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
this
is
basically
a
zoning
statute,
though,
talking
about
what
kind
of
master
plan
cities
shall
have?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
berkenfeld
wouldn't
help
you
by
itself,
because
that's
just
like
the
town
of
hallie.
