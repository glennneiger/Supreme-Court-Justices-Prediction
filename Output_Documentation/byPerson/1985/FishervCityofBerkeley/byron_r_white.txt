justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
your
allegation
when
you...
you
brought
this
suit,
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
your
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
of?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
did
later?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
did
you
raise
it?
did
you
say
that
this
ordinance
violates
the
sherman
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know.
but
how
could
it
be
preempted
if
it
wasn't
in
conflict
with
the
sherman
act,
if
it
wasn't
violative
of
the
sherman
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
only
the
california
supreme
court
answered
your
claim
by
saying
this
ordinance
didn't
violate
the
sherman
act,
didn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
it
thought
your
claim
was
that
the
ordinance
violated
the
sherman
act,
did
it
have
jurisdiction
to
decide
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
preemption
argument
then
is
that
berkeley
orders
what
the
sherman
act
forbids?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
call
that
a
preemption
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
anyway,
part
of
it
is
that
we
must
say
that
what
the
ordinance
orders
the
sherman
act
forbids?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
this
must
be
either
an
agreement,
a
conspiracy,
or
a
combination?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
must
be
to
violate
it,
mustn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
that
were
a
violation,
you
would
think
that
you
could
sue
the
landlords
for
treble
damages,
for
being
in
a
combination
or
an
agreement
or
a
conspiracy.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
on
pain
of
criminal
penalties
they
were
forced
to
keep
their
rent
at
a
certain
level?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
a
strange
kind
of
a
conspiracy
to
say
this
is
a
conspiracy
even
though
we
are
forced
to
do
it
against
our
will.
we
not
only
don't
agree
to
it,
we
are
up
in
the
supreme
court
claiming
we
don't.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
the
issue
there...
we
didn't
have
to
hold
that
that
would
violate
the
sherman
act.
just
all
we
had
to
hold
that
it
was
or
wasn't
immune
from
challenge
under
the
sherman
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
that
you
just
said
that
your
preemption
argument
is
that
this
ordinance
is
preempted
because
it
orders
what
the
sherman
act
forbids.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
mustn't
we
find
that
the
sherman
act
forbids
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
before
you
brought
this
suit
there
had
been
another
suit
brought
against
berkeley
and
against
the
landlords
and
it
had
been
concluded.
it
was
brought
in
the
federal
court,
claiming
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
and
it
was
determined
that
there
was
no
violation.
it
went
up
on
appeal,
it
was
affirmed
in
the
court
of
appeals,
it
came
here
and
we
affirmed:
no
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
you
suggest
to
me
that
you
could
still
be
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
then
you
would
argue
that
there's
a
federal
policy
of
competition.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
said
it
was
an
integral
part,
you
would
have
to
say
that
our
so-called
decisions
were
erroneous
under
the
prior
sherman
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
the
statute
can't...
this
new
statute
can't
be
an
integral
part
of
your
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
helps
you,
it
certainly
helps
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
tribe,
if
you
say
that
it
must
have
been
found
in
this
case
that
the
ordinance
violated
the
sherman
act,
why
would
the
california
courts...
where
did
they
get
the
power
to
pass
on
that
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
proof
of
a
conspiracy
or
a
combination
between
public
officials
and
a
tenants
organization?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
ever
prove
that?
i
doubt
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
all
the
council
members
were
tenants?
justice
byron
r.
white
only
for
the
individual
properties.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
so
that
they
don't...
there's
no
uniform
price
set
for
rental
units.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
prices
are...
a
great
variety
of
prices
between
individual
units,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
say...
there
isn't
a
uniform
price
for
every
100
square
feet
of
rental
space?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
you'd
say
the
same,
just
doing
it
another
way,
if
they
just
limited
the
profit?
justice
byron
r.
white
minimum
wages?
