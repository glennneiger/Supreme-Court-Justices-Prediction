mr.
jon
smock
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
comes
before
this
court
on
appeal
from
a
decision
of
the
california
supreme
court.
the
california
court
upheld
a
local
price-fixing
ordinance
adopted
without
benefit
of
any
authorizing
state
legislation.
the
ordinance
plainly
in
our
view
places
irresistible
pressure
on
the
owners
of
23,000
private
rental
units
in
the
city
of
berkeley
to
coalesce
and
combine
in
obedience
to
that
ordinance.
berkeley
makes
it
a
crime
to
engage
in
conduct
which
federal
law
commands.
the
ordinance
is
plainly
in
conflict
with
both
the
letter
and
spirit
of
overriding
policy
favoring
price
competition
in
the
marketplace,
a
policy
mandated
by
section
1
of
the
sherman
act,
the
magna
carta
of
free
enterprise.
we
seek
reversal
of
the
california
decision
because
it
is
plainly
wrong.
the
decision
is
wrong
because
it
ignores
the
intent
of
congress
in
the
recent
enactment
of
the
local
government
antitrust
act
of
1984,
an
act
that
expressly
refused
to
grant
the
very
same
exemption
sought
by
berkeley
before
this
court,
and
an
act,
i
might
add,
that
was
not
even
cited
by
the
california
court
in
its
opinion.
the
decision
is
wrong
because
it
validates
local
anticompetitive
action,
here
naked
price-fixing,
in
the
complete
absence
of
any
state
authorizing
legislation.
it
is
wrong
because
it
creates
a
new
and
untested
rule
for
the
determination
of
the
municipal
exemption
from
federal
antitrust
policy,
ignoring
the
teachings
of
this
court
in
its
boulder
and
lafayette
opinions.
indeed,
the
only
redeeming
virtue
of
this
decision
is
its
candid
admission
that
it
found
itself,
in
its
own
words,
"forced
to
wander
off
the
map
without
benefit
of
trail
or
compass.
"
mr.
jon
smock
the
suit
was
filed,
justice
white,
in
the
superior
court
in
1980
prior
to
this
court's
decision
in
boulder.
mr.
jon
smock
the
claim
was
for
facial
invalidity
of
the
ordinance.
mr.
jon
smock
because
of
constitutional
deficiencies
of
a
number
of
sorts:
due
process,
equal
protection,
and
several
others.
we
did
not
at
that
time
specifically
raise
the
antitrust
issue.
mr.
jon
smock
but
we
did
later,
and
it
was
fully
considered
by
the
california
supreme
court.
mr.
jon
smock
not
in
terms
of
violation.
we
raised
it
in
terms
of
preemption.
mr.
jon
smock
we
don't
believe,
your
honor,
that
a
strict
violation
is
necessary
because
the
policy
underlying
the
sherman
act
is
for
free
competition
in
the
marketplace.
here
you
have
local
regulation,
adopted
without
benefit
of
state
authorization,
ignoring
this
court's
test
in
boulder,
and
we
believe
that
that
constitutes
preemption.
mr.
jon
smock
it
answered
the
claim
by
saying
there
is
no
violation
after
it
established
a
brand
new,
untested,
uncharted
test,
a
test
never
before
applied
in
any
antitrust
case
to
our
knowledge.
mr.
jon
smock
it
did,
not
in
the
sense
of
violation,
because
jurisdiction,
as
you
know,
is
exclusively
in
the
federal
courts
under
the
sherman
act.
so
i
don't
think
that
it
can
reach
the
issue
of
violation
per
se,
but
it
was
certainly
competent
to
determine
the
preemption
issue
because
a
local
enactment,
like
state
legislation,
can
be
considered
by
state
courts
under
the
preemption
concept.
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
preemption
for
this
purpose
is
simply
a
shorthand
expression
for
a
determination
of
whether
the
congress
intended
to
reach
the
conduct
under
consideration,
and
in
our
view
the
congress
by
the
local
government
antitrust
act
of
1984
very
clearly
and
unequivocally
intended
to
reach
the
very
kind
of
conduct
engaged
in
by
the
city
of
berkeley
here.
indeed,
the
committee
report
of
the
house
judiciary
committee
is
very
instructive
on
that
subject,
and
let
me
quote:
"if
congress
were
confident
that
the
actions
of
local
government
and
their
officials
were
always
in
the
public
interest
or
would
never
work
unnecessary
anticompetitive
injury,
it
could
simply
exclude
them
from
the
application
of
the
antitrust
laws
entirely.
"
"the
record
does
not
support
such
action.
"
in
the
face
of
that
congressional
action,
again
not
even
cited
by
the
california
supreme
court
below--
mr.
jon
smock
--the
briefing
period,
justice
rehnquist,
had
been
concluded
and
argument
already
held
in
may.
the
antitrust
act,
of
course,
was
considered
by
the
congress
at
that
time
and
not
adopted
until
perhaps
two
months
later.
the
decision,
however,
was
not
filed
until
december
27th.
mr.
jon
smock
i
suspect
not
that
they
failed
to
find
it
on
its
own,
but
in
a
case
in
which
the
issue
specifically
before
them
was
conflict
with
the
sherman
act
i
suspect
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
california
court,
with
its
resources,
should
certainly
have
been
able
to
be
aware
of
the
congressional
action
in
an
area
that
so
vitally
affected,
in
our
judgment,
the
proper
decision
of
the
case.
and
they
totally
ignored
the
act.
they
also
ignored,
in
our
judgment,
the
action
of
the
state
legislature,
for
the
state
legislature
has
never
authorized
in
any
way,
shape
or
form
the
conduct
under
consideration
here
that
berkeley
is
engaged
in.
indeed,
the
california
legislature
has
adopted
a
position
of
precise
neutrality
on
this
issue.
it
has
spoken
clearly
and
unequivocally
to
its
neutral
position.
the
california
legislation
upon
which
berkeley
relies,
i
should
add,
was
planning
and
development
legislation
adopted
after...
i
should
like
to
repeat
that.
the
legislation
upon
which
berkeley
relies
was
adopted
after
the
adoption
of
the
ordinance
here
under
consideration.
it
makes
a
mockery
of
chronology
for
berkeley
to
seriously
suggest
that
it
relied
in
any
way
upon
any
statutory
scheme.
in
fact,
the
california
court
in
an
earlier
decision,
and
repeated
again
in
this
decision,
has
identified
the
authority
of
the
city
of
berkeley
to
engage
in
its
anticompetitive
conduct
as
the
same
kind
of
home
rule
authority
that
this
court
struck
down
in
the
city
of
berkeley...
in
the
city
of
boulder
case
as
being
insufficient
to
grant
parker-type
immunity
to
local
anticompetitive
activity.
we
suggest
that
the
decision
of
the
california
supreme
court
is
wrong.
we
suggest
that
it
failed
to
apply
the
per
se
rule
to
strike
down
price-fixing
that
has
been
always
applied
by
this
court
whenever
it
has
been
faced
with
a
decision
involving
the
fixing
of
prices.
mr.
jon
smock
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
throughout
these
proceedings,
berkeley
has
never
explained
why
price-fixing
by
a
municipality
is
any
less
intrusive
upon
competition
in
the
marketplace,
and
berkeley
has
never
suggested
any
limits
to
its
assumed
authority
to
fix
prices.
mr.
jon
smock
not
at
all,
justice
rehnquist.
i
believe
it
entirely
competent
for
the
state
of
berkeley
not
only
to
ratify
action,
but
to
adopt
a
comprehensive
rent
control
anticompetitive
scheme
if
it
so
desired.
but
in
the
language
of
this
court,
that
legislation
would
require
clear
articulation
and
affirmative
expression
of
an
intent
on
the
part
of
the
legislature
to
substitute
a
regulatory
scheme
for
our
competitive
policy.
and
because
of
comity,
congress
recognizes
the
ability
of
states
to
engage
in
economic
regulation.
but
as
this
court
said
in
lafayette,
you
cannot
tolerate
and
the
congress
has
not
recognized
the
ability
of
60,000-plus
units
of
local
government
scattered
across
the
country
to
substitute
their
judgment
for
that
of
the
congress
and
that
of
the
sovereign
states.
the
cities
are
not
themselves
sovereign,
and
congress
has
never
granted
to
cities...
indeed,
just
last
year
it
denied
cities
the
very
exemption
which
berkeley
seeks
here.
so
i
do
not
in
the
slightest
suggest
that
it
would
not
be
competent
for
california
to
adopt
a
regulatory
scheme,
or
indeed
to
ratify
past
schemes,
but
it
has
not
done
so.
it
has
instead
maintained
a
position
of
strict
and
precise
neutrality,
and
the
statutory
scheme
relied
upon
by
berkeley
here
says
in
its
own
statutory
section
65589(b)
of
the
government
code
that
nothing
in
that
article
is
intended
to
authorize
or
repeal
any
authority
that
may
exist
for
local
governments
to
engage
in
rent
control.
indeed,
in
health
and
safety
code
section
50,001,
the
legislature
has
spoken
expressly
to
an
intent
to
provide
for
a
free
marketplace
in
housing
in
california.
so
it
is
our
judgment
that
california
as
a
state
legislative
scheme
has
adopted
a
policy
that
is
pro-development,
that
is
pro-improvement,
that
is
pro-housing,
that
the
regulatory
scheme
of
berkeley
is
in
conflict
with
because
california
has
very
clearly
adopted
a
contrary
policy.
mr.
jon
smock
justice
o'connor,
we
believe
that
the
conspiracy
here
is
exactly
the
same
as
that
recognized
by
this
court
in
the
midcal
case.
what
you
have
is
a
local
ordinance.
in
midcal,
of
course,
you
had
a
state
statute,
but
here
you
have
a
local
ordinance
that
vertically
imposes
upon
owners
of
rental
property
in
california...
in
berkeley,
california,
a
duty
to
follow
the
mandates
of
that
ordinance.
mr.
jon
smock
for
the
purpose
of
sherman
act
preemption
or
responsibility,
i
suggest
that
that
is
precisely
correct,
only
for
that
purpose.
that
is,
when
government
mandates
conduct
of
its
citizens
you
are
engaged
in
a
vertical
combination
of
exactly
the
same
type
recognized
by
this
court
in
midcal.
but
in
turn,
that
vertical
compulsion
places
an
irresistible
pressure
upon
those
who
are
compelled
by
that
law
to
coalesce
in
a
horizontal
combination
to
maintain
prices
at
the
level
fixed
by
the
vertical
compulsion
of
the
city.
mr.
jon
smock
not
at
all.
if
i
may
respectfully
suggest,
we
don't
ask
for
a
change
in
the
law
by
this
court.
rather,
it
is
berkeley
who
seeks
to
change
the
law
and
to
obtain
a
decision
from
this
court
that
is
precisely
the
same
kind
of
decision
that
congress
refused
to
give
them
in
the
local
government
antitrust
act.
we
don't
seek
a
change
in
the
law.
we
seek
only
the
fair
application
of
the
law
as
already
enunciated
by
prior
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
jon
smock
while
we
raise
the
issue,
we
do
not
press
it
here.
we
think
that
it
is
a
defensible
issue,
but
we
do
not
press
it.
berkeley
itself
is
obviously
engaged--
mr.
jon
smock
--with
all
due
respect,
i
don't
believe
that
the
court
is
compelled
to
address
any
of
our
claims,
although
we
do
think
that
if
you
were
to
reject
our
section
1
claim
that
it
would
be
an
appropriate
case
for
an
inquiry
into
the
section
2
issue,
because
in
our
judgment
berkeley
is
substituting
the
owners'
pocketbooks
for
government's
pocketbooks,
because
the
city
of
berkeley
is
clearly
engaged
in
the
provision
of
housing
in
the
public
sector
and
we
believe
that
that
constitutes--
mr.
jon
smock
--it
is
a
provider
of
housing
and,
while
it
may
well
be
a
competitor,
it
is
approaching
or
could
approach
a
monopolistic
position
in
the
market
were
it
to
succeed
in
its
long-term
goal
of
depressing
housing
prices
in
the
city
of
berkeley
and,
as
suggested
by
a
pamphlet
circulated
in
berkeley
that
formed
something
of
the
cornerstone
for
berkeley's
rent
control
activities
by
that
depression
in
the
market
prices
would
be
at
such
levels
as
cities
could
then
condemn
the
property
and
take
over
that
property
at
prices
lower
than
market
price.
and
in
that
sense,
one
could
impute
to
berkeley
an
intent
to
engage
in
monopolistic
conduct.
i
don't
think
that
on
this
record
and
on
what
we
have
presented
that
that
is
a
necessary
result,
but
it
is
certainly
one
that
is
conceivable
in
the
confines
of
this
case.
mr.
jon
smock
that's
absolutely
correct,
justice
white.
mr.
jon
smock
yes.
mr.
jon
smock
that
is
precisely
correct.
mr.
jon
smock
it
could
be.
mr.
jon
smock
to
violate
it,
yes.
and
we
say
that
that
is
here
and
that
the
evidence
is
clear
under
midcal
that
there
is
a--
mr.
jon
smock
--i
think
there
is
absolutely
no
question
whatever
that
if
the
federal
government
were
to
move
against
the
owners
in
berkeley--
mr.
jon
smock
--that
raises
the
different
and
difficult
question
of
whether
the
city
can
act
as
a--
mr.
jon
smock
--yes,
i
understand
that.
but
that
is
the
same
kind
of
combination
that
you
recognized
in
midcal.
mr.
jon
smock
where
wholesalers
are
compelled
by
state
law,
against
their
will,
to
follow
that
state
law.
and
i
suggest
that
is
conflict.
whether
it
be
called--
mr.
jon
smock
--and
that
the
state
law
was
preempted
by
the
federal
law
because
of
the
overriding
federal
policy
which
is
obstructed
by
that
state
law.
mr.
jon
smock
we
do
not
believe
so,
but
if
violation
were
necessary
then
we
believe
violation
is
shown
in
this
case,
for
the
very
reason
that
you
found
the
conflict
in
midcal.
to
the
extent
that
you
find
a
necessity
or
hold
a
necessity
to
find
a
violation,
i
think
it's
clear
that
you
could
find
a
violation
here.
mr.
jon
smock
yes,
sir.
mr.
jon
smock
yes,
you
do
find
that
the
sherman
act
forbids
this.
but
you
find
that
not
just
because
of
the
letter
of
the
sherman
act,
but
because
of
the
policy,
the
economic
policy
that
underlies
the
sherman
act,
which
is
competition
in
the
marketplace,
free
competition
in
the
marketplace.
and
the
activities
of
berkeley
jeopardize
that
national
economy
because
it
constricts
marketplace
freedom.
the
activity
involved
here,
as
it
does
real
property,
makes
the
activities
involved
in
lafayette
and
boulder
pale
into
insignificance.
here
you
are
involved
in
property
financing,
in
construction,
in
transportation,
in
products
and
services
on
<twenty-three
thousand>
[=
23,000]
rental
units
in
the
city
of
berkeley.
mr.
jon
smock
if
action
were
to
be
brought
against
the
city
of
berkeley
in
federal
district
court
challenging
the
berkeley
ordinance
on
the
basis
of
an
antitrust
violation,
then
i
think
that
that
action
would
be
successful.
mr.
jon
smock
yes,
and
that's
this
action.
this
action
raises
the
issue
in
a
preemption
concept
because
it
is
an
action
coming
from
a
state
court,
which
obviously
does
not
have
antitrust
liability
jurisdiction.
but
a
state
court
is
fully
competent
to
determine
the
conflict
between
a
local
ordinance
and
state
and
federal
law.
and
this
court
is
fully
competent
to
determine
that
conflict
without
finding
all
of
the
requisites
that
might
be
necessary
to
find
a
sherman
act
violation.
we
say
again,
if
you
should
find
that
you
must
find
a
violation,
then
we
think
that
it's
also
here.
in
other
words,
preemption
concepts
do
not
require
finding
all
of
the
elements
of
a
sherman
act
violation
where
you
have
a
violation
of
overriding
federal
policy,
as
indicated
in
the
hines
case,
where
a
local
ordinance
or
a
state
law
stands
as
an
obstruction
to
the
full
accomplishment
of
the
purposes
under
federal
law.
mr.
jon
smock
we
could
be
here
on
a
preemption
challenge--
mr.
jon
smock
--because--
mr.
jon
smock
--i
would
respectfully
suggest,
yes,
because
the
standard
for
conviction
under
a
sherman
act
charge
might
well
be
different
from
the
standard
applied
by
this
court
with
respect
to
competing
policies,
and
here
you
have
price-fixing,
which
is
the
traditional
form
of
conflict
which
this
court
has
traditionally
recognized
as
being
a
per
se
violation,
if
you
will,
of
the
sherman
act.
but
whether
called
violation
or
preemption,
the
real
issue
is
whether
congress
intended
to
proscribe
this
conduct.
and
we
respectfully
suggest
that
congress
did
intend
to
proscribe
the
very
conduct
in
issue
here
by
its
failure
to
grant
in
the
local
government
antitrust
act
this
kind
of
exemption
that
is
sought
by
berkeley
here.
mr.
jon
smock
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
jon
smock
--we
believe
that
the
local
government
antitrust
act
of
1984
constitutes
a
recognition
by
the
congress
of
the
activities
and
cases
decided
by
this
court--
mr.
jon
smock
--it
failed
to
grant
an
exemption--
mr.
jon
smock
--i
say
that
it
validated
the
activities
of
this
court
in
its
lafayette
and
boulder
decisions
in
an
affirmative
way,
and
to
the
extent
that
those
decisions
operated
to
invalidate
local
activity
that
otherwise
would
have
been
valid
before,
yes.
mr.
jon
smock
it
is
not
an
integral
part
of
the
argument
because
there
is
no
state
authorizing
legislation
adopted
by
california--
mr.
jon
smock
--well,
insofar
as
the
conflict
is
concerned,
yes.
mr.
jon
smock
i
don't
believe
so
at
all.
i
think
your
decisions
are
quite
correct,
and
what
i'm
suggesting--
mr.
jon
smock
--i
suggest
that
the
new
statute
validated--
mr.
jon
smock
--that
it
validated
the
action
taken
by
this
court;
that
the
congress
recognized
what
the
court
had
done
in
boulder
and
lafayette
and
gave
its
express
stamp
of
approval
by
its
denying
the
kind
of
exemption
sought
by
cities.
if
i
may,
i
should
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
jon
smock
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
has
never
in
its
90-year
history
of
interpreting
the
sherman
act
created
exceptions
to
price-fixing.
it
has
always
looked
to
congress.
as
this
court
said
in
maricopa,
it
is
for
the
congress
to
make
exceptions
to
that
rule.
mr.
jon
smock
i
respectfully
suggest
that
in
midcal--
mr.
jon
smock
--but
it
was
enforced
by
state
legislation.
mr.
jon
smock
only
with
respect
to
the
adoption
by
a
state
legislature,
as
in
midcal,
of
a
scheme
regardless
of
how
fixed.
in
our
judgment,
the
city
of
berkeley
is
wrong
in
its
analysis
with
respect
to
the
fact
that
prices
are
not
fixed
by
private
persons
here.
there
is
not
a
rent
control
board
that
fixes
a
price
other
than
a
rollback
price
to
a
base
rent
that
in
its--
mr.
jon
smock
--it
does
not
govern
one
of
his
competitors.
however,
all
are
forced
to
coalesce
in
combination
to
maintain
the
price
which
is
compelled
upon
them
by
local
ordinance.
mr.
jon
smock
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
jon
smock
only
for
his
individual
properties.
mr.
jon
smock
there
is
a
uniform
price
set
by
the
city,
by
having
rolled
back
prices
to
a
may
31--
mr.
jon
smock
--there
are
price
differentials.
mr.
jon
smock
not
at
all.
but
the
fact
that
price
is
tampered
with
has
always
been
considered
by
this
court
to
be
an
improper
function
unless
permitted
by
express
congressional
act.
and
we
suggest
that
that
is
not
appropriate
for
the
city
of
berkeley
to
engage
in
price
tampering.
price
has
been
the
central
nervous
system
of
the
economy.
price
competition
is
the
hallmark
of
the
national
economy,
and
price
competition
is
destroyed
here.
mr.
jon
smock
absolutely.
you
cannot
control
the
way
in
which
a
private
entrepreneur
approaches
the
marketplace
with
respect
to
price
because
it
destroys
competition.
what
we
have
in
effect
is
a
regulatory
declaration
by
the
city
of
berkeley
that
says:
competition
is
inappropriate
in
our
city;
we
choose
to
march
to
our
own
drummer
and
we
will
not
pay
attention
to
the
national
economic
policy
dictated
by
congress
in
the
sherman
act.
mr.
jon
smock
absolutely.
taxi
fares
are
inappropriately
set
by
a
municipality
unless
authorized
by
state
legislation.
mr.
jon
smock
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
jon
smock
minimum
wages,
unless
set
by
congress,
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
garcia,
and
that
is
a
perfect
example
of
the
appropriate
way
in
which
persons
who
are
adversely
affected
should
proceed.
take
their
case
to
congress
and
make
their
case,
as
the
cities
and
counties
did
following
this
court's
decision
in
garcia,
and
as
the
cities
and
counties
did
following
this
court's
decision
in
boulder.
and
what
they
wanted,
congress
did
not
give
them.
and
i
respectfully
suggest
that
the
california
decision
should
be
reversed.
thank
you.
