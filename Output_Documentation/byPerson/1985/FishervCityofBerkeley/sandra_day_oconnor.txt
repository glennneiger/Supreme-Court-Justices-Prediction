mr.
smock,
if
the
court
were
to
employ
a
preemption
analysis
and
look
for
proof
that
the
city
ordinance
violated
the
antitrust
laws,
where
is
the
conspiracy
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
that
sense,
if
you're
right
it
would
seem
to
me
that
any
governmental
action
would
of
necessity
amount
to
a
vertical
conspiracy
under
your
theory.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
don't
think
that
extends
midcal
at
all?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
while
i
have
you
interrupted,
may
i
inquire
whether
you're
also
pressing
a
section
2
violation
under
the
sherman
act?
are
you
or
aren't
you?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
we
didn't
agree
with
you
on
section
1,
would
we
have
to
address
your
section
2
claim
then?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
think
that
the
city
itself
is
a
competitor
and
a
monopolist?
