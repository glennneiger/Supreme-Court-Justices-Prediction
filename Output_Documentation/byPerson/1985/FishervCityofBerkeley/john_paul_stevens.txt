mr.
smock,
if
congress
proscribed
this
conduct
it
did
it
in
1890,
i
think,
not
a
couple
of
years
ago;
isn't
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
there
was
an
affirmative
prohibition
enacted
in
the
recent
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
that
statute
prohibited
anything
that
was
not
previously
prohibited?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
not
an
answer
to
my
question.
do
you
think
it
prohibited
anything
that
was
not
previously
unlawful?
and
if
so,
what?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
a
little
complex
for
me.
i
gather
that
statute's
an
integral
part
of
your
argument,
is
that
right?
you
must
rely
on
that
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
insofar
as
you
make
a
federal
claim,
insofar
as
you
make
a
federal
claim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
smock,
have
we
ever
held
that
price-fixing
in
violation
of
the
sherman
act
occurs
when
no
private
party
makes
a
decision
on
what
price
shall
be
charged?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
authorized
the
filing
by
a
wine
producer
of
a
price
list
that
everybody
else
had
to
follow.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand,
but
i'm
asking
if
there's
any
price-fixing
case
that
does
not
involve
private
conduct
by
somebody
who
could
be
said
to
have
violated
the
sherman
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
any
private
person
here
fix
a
price
that
governs
one
of
his
competitors?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
smock,
would
you
make
the
same
argument
about
taxi
fares?
