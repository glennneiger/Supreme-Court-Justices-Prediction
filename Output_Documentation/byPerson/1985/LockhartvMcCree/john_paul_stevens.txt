mr.
clark,
doesn't
your
argument
prove
too
much?
supposing
they
excluded
all
democrats,
for
example,
and
left
just
nothing
but
republicans,
and
you
could
prove
all
the
republicans
were
perfectly
impartial.
would
that
be
permissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
that.
but
in
my
hypothetical,
if
you
had
nothing
left
but
republicans
would
that
be
permissible?
say
they're
all
impartial.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no.
they
just
excluded
all
democrats
and
left
nothing
but
republicans.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they're
all
impartial
republicans.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
not
permissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
i'm
suggesting
is
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
a
complete
answer
to
the
case
to
say
that
the
remaining
jury,
examined
individually,
each
one
of
them
there's
no
objection
to.
that's
what
your
argument
is,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
general
clark,
is
it
not
correct
that
the
state
agrees
that
there
is
a
substantial
percentage
of
witherspoon
excludibles
who
could
follow
state
law
on
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
agree,
i
take
it,
that
the
jurors
we're
talking
about
here,
the
17
percent
or
whatever
the
figure
is,
would
all
be
qualified
to
sit
in
all
of
those
cases
if
they
were
not
capital
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
also
state
to
the
court
in
these
cases,
the
death
cases,
that
they
can
pass
on
guilt
or
innocence
without
any
disability,
and
you
agree
with
that
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
does
it
boil
down
to
the
balancing
between
the
state's
interest
in
the
unitary
system
in
capital
cases
as
opposed
to
this
proven,
as
i
understand
the
record,
conviction
proneness
of
this
particular
jury?
is
that
what
we're
balancing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
under
the
eighth
circuit
holding
you
could
have
the
best
of
both
possible
worlds,
because
it
follows
state
law
or
guilt
or
innocence,
and
then
you
just
have
to
have
a
few
extra
alternates
on.
you
have
to
give
up
your
state
policy
as
to
a
few
of
the
jurors
in
a
small
segment
of
the
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
may
i
also
ask,
is
the
state
interest
a
matter
of
policy
or
is
there
any
constitutional
right
to
this?
is
there
any
constitutional
guarantee
that
you
can't
protect
yourself
by
adequate
peremptories
or
use
of
alternates,
for
example?
it
seems
to
me
you're
saying
you
have
a
policy
at
stake.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they're
saying
they
have
a
constitutional
interest
in
an
impartial
jury,
and
that
they're
not
getting
an
impartial
jury.
are
they
weighing
a
constitutional
claim
against
your
policy
interest,
that's
what
i'm
trying
to--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
you're
recusing
them
from
the
portion
of
the
proceeding
in
which
they
admittedly
can
follow
state
law,
because
they
cannot
follow
state
law
in
a
later
proceeding
in
which
they
admit
they
should
be
excluded.
