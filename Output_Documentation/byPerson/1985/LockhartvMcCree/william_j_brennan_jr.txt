mr.

may
i
ask,
if
the
court
should
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
cross-section
issue,
would
you
have
a
different
argument
to
make
on
the
impartiality
question?

is
that
to
say
that
if
we
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
cross-section
issue,
we
also
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
impartiality
issue?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.

that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at.
