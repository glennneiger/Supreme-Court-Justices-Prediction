we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
lockhart
against
mccree.
mr.
attorney
general,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there's
no
statutory
category?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
this
recital
is
not
a
statutory
exclusion
that
you
were
reciting?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
saying
as
a
practical
matter
you
don't
find
doctors,
lawyers,
and
businessmen
on
juries,
generally
speaking?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
gross.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
consider
a
jury
to
be
non-representative
in,
let's
say,
the
district
of
columbia,
where
overwhelmingly
the
people
living
in
the
district
of
columbia
are
government
employees?
now,
if
the
majority
of
a
given
jury
is
not
made
up
of...
if
a
given
jury
is
not
made
up
of
a
majority
of
government
employees,
then
is
it
representative
of
the
community
in
your
view?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
washington,
d.c.,
has
more
lawyers
per
square
city
block
or
square
mile
than
any
city
in
the
world.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
you
ever
hear
of
a
lawyer
on
a
washington
jury?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
there's
no
occupational
exclusion
of
lawyers.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
nor
doctors.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
you
have
destroyed
the
impartiality
of
a
jury
if
the
prosecutor
is
permitted
one
way
or
another
to
exclude
people
whose
members
of
the
family
have
been
convicted
of
felonies?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
use
is
made
of
the
peremptory
challenge
if
they
can't
challenge
for
cause
in
those
cases?
do
you
think
a
juror...
or
the
defense,
for
example...
do
you
think
defense
counsel
wants
people
on
the
jury
whose
members
of
families
are
working
in
the
prosecutor's
office,
for
example?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
who
have
ever
been
prosecutors?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
attorney
general?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
