justice
byron
r.
white
you're
really
saying
the
absence
of
these
other
people
is
what
really
biases
the
jury.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
if
it
hadn't
have
been
for
this
exclusion
conviction
would
have
been
less
likely?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
i
misunderstand
your
brief
to
argue
that
at
the
voir
dire
a
prosecutor
should
not
inquire
of
the
guilt-innocence,
potential
guilt-innocence
juror,
anything
about
his
attitudes
towards
the
death
penalty?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional,
do
you
think,
if
the
prosecutor
said,
would
you
be
willing
to
impose
the
death
penalty,
and
he
said,
no,
in
no
circumstances;
well,
you,
despite
your
attitude
toward
the
death
penalty,
would
you
believe
that
would
effect
your
deliberations
on
guilt
or
innocence?
can't
he
ask
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
suggest
that
there
are
no
people
who
are
against
the
death
penalty
who
would
also
not
vote
for
guilt?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
does
a
prosecutor
identify
them
without
asking
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
object
to
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
that
the
challenge
for
cause
were
eliminated
just
because
of
the
opposition
to
the
death
penalty.
couldn't
a
prosecutor
at
least
on
voir
dire
identify
those
people
who
are
opposed
to
the
death
penalty,
so
that
he
might
exercise
his
peremptories
against
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
it
wouldn't
be
barred
constitutionally?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
a...
do
you
take
any
position
that
if
you
win,
whether
the
ruling
would
be
retroactive?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes,
but
what
if
he
says,
i
will
follow
state
law
except
with
respect
to
capital
punishment?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
he
says,
i
can
decide
guilt
or
innocence
very
fairly
and
not
be
affected
at
all
by
my
views
about
the
death
penalty.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
the
voir
dire
conducted
individually?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
they
excused
six
out
of
the
entire
panel?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
but
the
three,
the
other
three,
were
because
of
individual
questioning?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
if
you
had
a
rule
that
you
cannot
throw
off
witherspoon
excludibles,
you
cannot
exclude
them
from
the
guilt
or
innocence
phase,
you
would
just...
you
would
find
out
if
they
ware
opposed
to
the
death
penalty,
but
then
seat
them.
and
then
you
could,
when
you
had
filled
up
the...
got
your
twelve
jurors,
you
would
add
some
alternates.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
guess
we
just
wouldn't
know
how
many
alternates
you
would
have
had
to
have
on
that
basis
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
don't
know
now.
