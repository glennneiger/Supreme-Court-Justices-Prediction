justice
sandra
day
o'connor
general
clark,
i
would
assume
that
would
only
be
if
such
a
holding
were
made
retroactive.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
general
clark,
may
i
inquire
about
this
matter?
does
it
make
any
difference
here
that,
after
the
state
had
excused
these
jurors
for
cause
under
witherspoon,
that
it
later
waived
its
request
for
the
death
penalty?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
that
leave
open
for
manipulation
by
the
state
in
a
given
case
an
option
to
excuse
jurors
under
witherspoon
and
then
plan
all
along
to
waive
a
request
for
the
death
penalty?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
does
the
record
disclose
in
this
case
why
the
state
opted
to
proceed
as
it
did
and
forego
requesting
the
death
penalty,
after
initially
embarking
on
that
course?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
don't
think
that
responds
to
my
question.
my
concern
is
that
is
i
understand
this
case
the
state
proceeded
initially
when
it
empaneled
a
jury
on
the
premise
that
it
was
going
to
ask
the
death
penalty.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it
excused
for
cause
some
jurors
under
the
witherspoon
doctrine,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
then
at
some
time
after
or
during
the
trial,
the
state
decided
not
to
seek
the
death
penalty
after
all.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
state
never
backed
off
and
decided
not
to
seek
the
death
penalty?
that
had
been
my
understanding.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
not
in
mccree?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
general
clark,
i
thought
that
respondent's
argument
was
more
along
the
line
of
an
argument
that
by
excluding
these
jurors
at
the
guilt-innocence
phase
of
the
case
that
it
was
a
procedure
whereby
the
state
has
organized
the
procedure
in
such
a
way
that
it
would
be
more
likely
to
result
in
a
guilty
verdict
because
of
the
evidence
produced
by
the
studies,
not
that
the
jury
panel
was
in
fact
biased
or
not
impartial,
but
that
it
was
a
procedure
by
which
the
state
is
more
likely
to
obtain
a
jury
which
will
vote
for
a
guilty
verdict.
i
thought
that
was
the
thrust
of
their
argument.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
leads
to
the
question
of
whether
the
state's
interest,
which
of
course
is
substantial,
is
more
substantial
than
the
defendant's
interest
in
having
a
fair
procedure.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
gross,
what
if
by
chance
there
were
no
witherspoon
excludibles
on
the
jury
panel?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
by
your
terms
it
wouldn't
be
a
fair
cross-section,
i
suppose,
as
i
understand
your
argument.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
would
say
that
it
was
a
fair
and
impartial
jury,
even
if
by
chance
there
were
no
witherspoon
excludibles
on
the
jury?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
you
really
are
arguing
for
is
a
sort
of
prophylactic
rule.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
gross,
if
you're
right
then
i
suppose
any
state
which
allowed
the
state
to
make
peremptory
strikes
of
jurors
would
have
violated
the
constitution
if
it
tried
to
strike
from
the
jury
people
that
the
state
thought
would
be
more
likely
to
render
a
defense
verdict.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
not,
if
the
state
tries
to
exercise
all
of
its
peremptory
strikes
in
such
a
way
as
to
get
a
jury
that's
more
likely
to
convict?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
the
defendant
can
also
at
the
time
of
trial
selection,
in
asking
that
jurors
be
excused
for
cause,
have
the
defendant's
counterbalancing
excuses
for
cause,
can't
he?
