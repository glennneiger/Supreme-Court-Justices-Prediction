justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask,
mr.
attorney
general,
there
are
two
issues
and
they
are
independent,
are
they
not,
the
cross-section
issue
and
the
impartiality
issue?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
there
was
no
finding,
was
there,
of
bias
on
the
part
of
any
single
juror?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
you're
relying
primarily
on
the
statistical
and
expert
testimony--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--does
one
state
of
arkansas
provide
under
certain
circumstances
that
a
person
may
be
sentenced
to
life
without
benefit
of
parole?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes,
but
let's
forget
capital
cases
for
the
moment.
some
states
do
have
provisions
with
respect
to
certain
crimes
that
a
jury
may
sentence
for
life
without
benefit
of
parole.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
assume
there
are
states
that
have
it.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
think
there
are.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
think
texas
may
be
one
of
them.
in
such
a
state,
would
the
same
argument
you
make
here
with
respect
to
death-prone
jurors,
as
that
term
is
used,
apply
to
jurors
who,
responding
to
questions
from
the
court,
said
they
couldn't
possibly
agree
that
anyone
could
be
sentenced
for
life
without
benefit
of
parole?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
would
such
a
jury
be
a
cross-section
of
the
community
under
your
argument?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
do
you
have
to
do,
have
a
gallop
poll
to
determine
what
percentage
of
the
people
in
the
community
would
oppose
life
sentences
without
benefit
of
parole?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
for
example?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
would
you
approve
of
the
florida
system,
under
which
the
jury
may
or
may
not
recommend
capital
punishment,
and
the
judge
may
make
the
decision
with
respect
to,
the
final
decision
with
respect
to
capital
punishment?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes,
but
the
case
you're
arguing
is
constitutional
under
gregg,
and
it
is
the
law
in
the
majority
of
the
states.
but
coming
back
to
florida,
i
think
i've
read
statistical
showings
that
judges
are
more
prone
to
impose
capital
punishment
in
the
state
of
florida
than
the
juries.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
doesn't
that
cut
against
your
basic
argument,
that
so-called
death-prone
jurors
in
fact
are
more
willing
to
impose
capital
punishment
than
judges,
for
example?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
don't
think
so?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
would
you
argue
that
in
florida
the
people
who
would
not
be
willing
to
recommend
capital
punishment
should
not
be
excluded?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
would?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
even
though
the
ultimate
decision
is
to
be
made
by
a
court?
