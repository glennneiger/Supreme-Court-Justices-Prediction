mr.
samuel
r.
gross
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin
by
saying
a
few
words
about
the
jury
selection
in
mr.
mccree's
case.
the
jury
i
believe
was
drawn
from
ouachita
county
only,
contrary
to
general
clark's
assertion.
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
case,
the
judge
read
to
the
jury
the
information
charging
mr.
mccree
with
capital
murder.
with
that
in
mind,
the
judge
questioned
the
jurors
about
their
ability
to
be
fair
and
impartial
in
deciding
the
facts
of
the
case
and
in
rendering
the
verdict,
and
none
of
them
had
any
difficulty
with
that.
after
that
was
completed,
the
jurors
were
questioned
individually
and
at
length
about
their
ability
to
consider
imposing
the
death
penalty
on
mr.
mccree
if
a
penalty
determination
became
necessary.
and
at
that
point
eight
jurors
were
excluded
solely
because
they
would
not
consider
imposing
the
death
penalty
if
a
penalty
determination
became
necessary.
they
were
not
questioned
any
further
about
their
ability
to
be
fair
and
impartial
on
guilt
or
innocence.
they
were
not
challenged
on
that
ground.
nobody
expressed
any
doubts
about
their
ability
to
be
fair
and
impartial
on
guilt
or
innocence.
that
is
the
jury
that
mr.
mccree
received.
the
jury
that
mr.
mccree
is
asking
for
is
not
any
special
jury,
not
any
jury
for
capital
cases,
not
a
jury
that
consists
of
the
type
of
people
he
particularly
likes,
but
an
ordinary
criminal
jury,
the
same
jury
that
tries
99
percent
of
criminal
cases
in
arkansas
and
throughout
the
country,
the
jury
that
he
would
have
received
if
the
prosecutor
in
his
case
had
charged
him
with
non-capital
murder.
and
the
question
here
is
what
difference
does
it
make
that
he
received
a
death
qualified
jury
instead
of
an
ordinary
criminal
jury?
mr.
clark
said
that
we
are
questioning
the
policy
of
the
state.
we
are
not.
we
are
arguing
that
the
use
of
this
jury,
because
it
is
so
different
from
an
ordinary
criminal
jury,
violates
the
constitution,
it
violated
mr.
mccree's
sixth
amendment
right
to
a
fair
and
impartial
jury,
it
violated
his
fourteenth
amendment
right
to
a
trial
on
guilt
or
innocence
under
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
no,
justice
rehnquist.
i
think
arkansas
and
the
many
states
that
follow
the
same
policy
have
adequate
justification
for
excluding
ex-felons
for
a
number
of
reasons,
including
the
fact
that
these
people
have
been
adjudged,
have
been
judged
by
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
to
have
violated
serious
state
laws
and
as
a
deprivation
of
civil
rights,
as
a
punishment
imposed
on
them
as
a
consequence
of
their
violation.
i
don't
think
there's
any
problem
with
that
exclusion.
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
there
are
other
exclusions
that
are
permissible.
the
ordinary
jury
is
the
jury
be
would
have
received
in
a
non-capital
murder
case,
and
beyond
that
the
state
must
establish
that
the
jurors
cannot
be
fair
and
impartial
in
determining
the
questions
before
them,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
no.
the
constitution
provides,
the
sixth
amendment
provides,
for
a
local
jury,
a
jury
from
the
vicinity
in
which
the
crime
took
place.
now,
the
definition
of
the
locality
varies.
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
and
the
definition
could
vary
and
may
well.
it
may
well
mean
no
more
than
that
the
jury
has
to
be
from
the
state
in
which
the
crime
took
place.
but
i
don't
believe
that
there's
any
constitutional
restriction
on
the
state's
ability
to
define
the
geographical
unit
within
which
the
trial
jury
is
selected.
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
then
there
would
be
no
constitutional
violation.
if
none
were
excluded,
there
would
be
no
constitutional
violation.
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
the
fair
cross-section
argument,
of
course,
goes
to
the
systematic
exclusion
of
witherspoon
excludibles
from
the
group
that
is
eligible
for
service.
it
wouldn't
be
a
constitutional
violation
in
a
particular
case
in
which
the
issue
wasn't
presented.
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
yes.
we
agree
with
the
state
and
with
many
decisions
of
this
court
that
a
defendant
is
not
entitled
to
the
representation
of
any
particular
group
on
his
particular
trial
jury.
he
is
entitled
to
a
jury
that
is
selected
without
any
systematic
exclusion
of
groups,
and
in
this
case
of
a
distinctive
and
important
group.
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
it's
a
prophylactic
rule,
but
one
that
has
actual
consequences
in
quite
a
few
cases,
your
honor.
there
will
be
cases
in
which
the
jury
would
have
been
just
the
same.
in
the
evidence
in
this
case,
there
is
a
study
of
actual
voir
dire
transcripts
is
arkansas
capital
cases,
and
that
shows
that
the
number
of
witherspoon
excludibles
ranged
from
zero
is
some
cases
to
20
in
other
cases.
in
those
cases
in
which
it
was
zero,
then
there
was
no
prejudice.
in
those
cases
in
which
there
was
many,
the
prejudice
may
have
been
quite
great.
what
we
are
arguing
is
against
a
rule
of
systematic
exclusion
in
all
cases.
the
question...
i
want
to
address
three
major
points
in
this
argument.
the
first
i've
already
mentioned,
and
that
is
that
mccree
is
not
asking
for
any
special
procedure
in
capital
cases,
but
for
the
same
impartial
jury
that
all
non-capital
defendants
receive.
the
second
is
that
there
is
no
serious
disputes
about
the
facts
in
this
case.
there
is
no
serious
question
on
the
exhaustive
record
that
was
presented
in
the
district
court
and
on
the
findings
of
the
district
court,
which
were
affirmed
by
the
circuit
court,
that
death
qualification
produces
juries
or
guilt
and
innocence
that
are
less
representative,
less
deliberative,
and
less
impartial
than
ordinary
juries.
third,
that
there
is
no
state
interest
that
justifies
or
requires
this
extraordinary
procedure.
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
no,
your
honor,
no.
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
we're
not...
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we're
not
suggesting
that
any
juror
who
served
should
have
been
excluded.
we're
addressing
the
point
that
justice
stevens
raised
earlier,
that
a
jury
that
consists
completely
of
individual
jurors,
each
of
whom
could
be
fair
and
impartial,
as
a
group
will
not
be
fair
and
impartial
if
it
doesn't
represent
the
community,
and
in
particular
in
this
case
if
it
deviates
from
the
sense
of
the
community
in
a
particular
direction,
in
this
case
to
the
detriment
of
the
defense.
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
yes.
that
was
the
sentence
that
mr.
mccree
received.
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
i'm
not
aware
of
any
arkansas
provisions
for
that
sentence
except
in
capital
cases.
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
yes,
there
are,
i
know
that.
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
i
believe
so.
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
i
jurors
like
that
were
excluded
from
the
determination
of
guilt
or
innocence
in
a
state
that
uses
jury
sentencing
for
that
purpose,
for
determining
life
without
parole,
your
honor?
that's
a
theoretical
possibility,
but
i
think
no
more
than
that,
for
two
reasons.
first,
this
is
a
rare
occurrence.
it's
rare
that
this
practice
exists
and
few
states
have
jury
sentencing
outside
of
capital
punishment,
and
it's
rare
that
people
are
excluded
for
opposition
to
any
penalty
other
than
death.
second,
not
only
is
there
no
evidence
that
other
attitudes
about
punishment
have
the
distinctiveness
and
the
importance
that
death
penalty
attitudes
have;
the
evidence
in
the
record
here
indicates
the
opposite.
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
it
would
be
a
cross-section
of
the
community
unless
there
were
a
demonstration
that
the
group
that
were
excluded
were
important
and
distinctive
enough
to
have
a
material
bearing
on
the
process
of
jury
deliberations
and
on
jury
outcomes.
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
you'd
at
least
have
to
determine
that
it
is
a
substantial
number.
and
beyond
that,
you'd
have
to
show
that
these
people
have
something
to
contribute
that
might
make
a
difference
to
jury
deliberations
or
the
outcome
of
jury
deliberations.
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
for
example,
as
the
witherspoon
excludibles
in
this
case
as
have
been
shown,
these
people
have
legitimate
and
distinctive
attitudes
on
issues
such
as
the
meaning
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
it's
also
been
shown,
and
i
think
it's
very
significant,
that
juries
that
include
witherspoon
excludibles
have
a
better
memory
of
the
facts
of
the
case,
that
juries
that
include
witherspoon
excludibles
are
more
critical
of
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses
on
both
sides.
and
of
course,
the
evidence
shows
abundantly
that
juries
that
include
witherspoon
excludibles
are
less
likely
to
convict
the
defendant
as
charged
and
more
likely
to
acquit
or
in
many
cases
return
a
verdict
of
a
lesser
included
offense.
now,
that
sort
of
showing,
i
submit,
has
not
only
not
been
made
with
respect
to
other
groups,
but
is
very
unlikely,
and
the
reason
i
say
that
is
that
the
evidence
in
the
record
does
not
only
have
an
absence
of
evidence
on
other
attitudes;
there
are
studies
in
the
record
and
there
is
a
chapter
of
a
comprehensive
study
of
jury
behavior
in
the
record
which
examined
the
impact
of
other
characteristics,
other
attitudes,
other
demographic
characteristics
on
jury
behavior,
and
found
the
death
penalty
attitudes
are
uniquely
predictive,
that
nothing
else
has
the
type
of
impact
on
jury
behavior
and
jury
deliberations
that
death
penalty
attitudes
have.
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
personally,
i
have
no
particular
position
on
it.
it
certainly
is
constitutional
under
this
court's
decision
in
spaziano
versus
florida,
and
it
could
obviate
the
problem
here,
because--
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
they
sometimes
override
jury
recommendations
for
mercy
and
impose
the
death
penalty.
in
those
cases,
however,
the
florida
supreme
court
is
particularly
meticulous
in
its
proportionality
review,
and
it
has
reversed
a
fair...
number
of
those
death
sentences.
but
to
get
to
your--
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
no,
your
honor.
our
argument
is
not
that
death-prone...
that
the
jurors
who
now
qualify
to
sit
in
arkansas
are
more
likely
to
sentence
to
death
than
those
who
are
excluded.
we
concede
what
witherspoon
excludibles
should
not
sit
to
determine
the
issue
of
penalty.
our
argument
is
that--
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
--yes.
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
they
should
not
be
excluded
from--
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
--they
should
not
be
excluded
from
the
determination
of
guilt
or
innocence.
and
i
want
to
make
a
very
basic
point
in
response
to
your
honor.
our
argument
is
that
this
practice
biases
the
determination
of
guilt
or
innocence.
the
defendant's
right
to
a
fair
and
impartial
jury
determination
of
guilt
or
innocence
is
more
basic
and
more
important
than
any
defendant's
right
to
any
particular
procedure
at
the
stage
of
penalty.
a
fair
and
impartial
determination
of
guilt
or
innocence
is
an
absolute
constitutional
precondition
to
the
state's
right
to
sentence
the
defendant
to
anything...
life
without
parole,
death,
or
a
$100
fine.
and
the
problem
here
is
that
by
excluding
people
who
would
be
ineligible
to
serve
at
the
penalty
determination,
the
state
has
biased
the
determination
of
guilt
or
innocence--
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
your
honor,
that
is
an
even
handed
aspect
of
the
adversary
system.
in
the
state
of
arkansas,
the
prosecutor
does
and
the
prosecutor
in
this
case
did
exercise
peremptory
challenges
to
the
best
of
his
ability
to
try
to
obtain
a
jury
that
would
most
favor
his
side,
and
the
defense
attorney
tried
to
do
the
same
on
the
other
side.
the
problem
here...
one
of
the
problems,
but
not
the
only
one,
is
that
in
addition
to
that,
before
he
got
to
that
stage,
the
prosecutor
could
systematically
exclude
all
of
the
people
who
would
not
consider
imposing
the
death
penalty.
and
that's
not
the
only
problem.
there's
an
additional
problem
because
these
exclusions
were
done
by
law,
by
the
judge,
under
sanction
of
state
law.
and
there's
yet
another
problem--
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
--on
the
issue
of
capital
punishment?
yes,
the
defendant
can.
the
defendant
can
exclude
people
who
say
that
they
would
not
consider
any
punishment
other
than
death.
as
it
happens,
the
evidence
here
shows
unambiguously
that
such
people
are
exceedingly
rare.
the
findings
of
the
district
court
and
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
this
are
that
the
exclusion
of
those
people
contributes
only
to
the
appearance
of
justice
and
not
to
the
actuality
of
justice.
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
if
a
given
jury
is
not
representative
of
the
community,
there
is
no
problem,
because,
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
said,
the
defendant
doesn't
have
a
right
to
a
particular
jury
panel,
to
twelve
jurors
who
mirror
the
community.
if
the
jury
panel
does
not
represent
the
community,
then
the
question
becomes
is
the
difference
between
the
jury
panel,
between
the
pool
from
which
jurors
are
selected
and
the
community,
the
type
of
difference
which
gives
rise
to
a
constitutional
violation.
and
that--
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
--perhaps
more
judges,
too,
for
that
matter.
[laughter]
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
i
don't
know
if
they
ever
serve
on
washington
juries,
your
honor.
but
assume
they
don't.
i
have
no
quarrel
with
occupational
exclusions.
this
court
in
its
decisions
in
taylor
and
in
duren
specifically
said
that
states
are
free
to
prescribe
occupational
exclusions,
and
i
think
what
that--
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
--oh,
then
it's
a
de
facto
occupational
exclusion.
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
some
states
exclude
or,
more
likely,
provide
exemptions
for
doctors
and
lawyers
as
a
matter
of
statute,
and
in
some
places
particular
occupational
groups
for
one
reason
or
another
don't
happen
to
show
up.
they
get
exemptions
for
hardship
or
whatever.
i
don't
have
any
problem
with
that,
as
this
court
didn't
in
its
previous
decisions.
and
i
think
the
court's
statements
on
that
reflect
a
judgment
that
there
is
no
basis
for
presuming
that
doctors
or
lawyers
of
medical
health
professionals
in
general,
unlike
women,
unlike
blacks,
have
a
distinctiveness
that
makes
their
inclusion
in
jury
panels
important.
it
is
theoretically
conceivable
that
one
could
demonstrate
that
they
have
that
sort
of
distinctiveness,
but
in
fact
i
believe
the
evidence,
the
evidence
in
this
case,
shows
the
opposite.
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
the
eighth
circuit's
position
on
the
cross-section
issue
and
the
eighth
circuit's
findings
on
which
it
based
its
decision
on
the
cross-section
issue
dictate
a
holding
from
this
court
on
the
issue
of
impartiality
as
well.
the
eighth
circuit
found
that--
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
--no,
indeed.
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
i'm
sorry,
i
misunderstood
your
question.
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
the
court
on
formal
grounds
could
disagree
with
the
eighth
circuit
that
this
group
is
not
what
has
been
called
a
distinctive
or
cognizable
group.
nonetheless,
the
findings
of
the
district
court
and
the
findings
of
the
eighth
circuit
show
that
the
exclusion
of
this
group
has
an
actual
biasing
effect.
and
regardless
of
the
distinctiveness
of
this
group--
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
--that's
correct,
but
not
only
on
guilt
or
innocence,
also
on
the
predisposition
of
the
jury
prior
to
the
initiation
of
deliberations,
which
is
i
submit
a
constitutional
issue
in
itself,
and
also
on
the
conduct
of
deliberations.
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
that's
correct,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
exactly.
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
that's
right.
this
jury
is
not
biased
because
any
individual
on
it
was
unqualified.
it's
biased
because
it's
skewed.
let
me
give
you
an
example.
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
the
conviction
may
have
been
less
likely.
i
think
the
most
likely
effect
is
that
the
finding
that
the
murder
in
this
case
occurred
in
the
course
of
a
robbery
wouldn't
have
been
returned.
the
evidence
of
the
existence
of
a
robbery
in
mr.
mccree's
case
was
entirely
circumstantial.
if
a
jury
had
not
believed
that
the
state
had
proven
the
existence
of
a
robbery
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
then
mr.
mccree
could
not
have
been
sentenced
to
life
without
parole
or
to
the
death
penalty.
and
a
different
jury
could
reasonably
have
reached
a
different
conclusion
on
that
issue,
or
on
other
issues.
let
me
say
something
about
the
effect
here
and
how
it
indicates
fairness.
there
are
many
studies
in
the
record
here,
but
the
effect
here
is
not
simply
one
that
is
known
through
studies.
it
is
well
known
in
the
legal
community.
let
me
give
you
an
example,
if
i
may.
in
a
brief
amicus
curiae
submitted
by
the
dean
of
the
university
of
missouri
at
kansas
law
school
and
by
a
jackson
city
prosecutor,
they
cite
a
section
of
a
manual
prepared
by
the
missouri
attorney
general's
office
which
says:
"in
the
hands
of
a
prepared
state's
attorney,
the
death
penalty
jury
selection
process,
as
in
no
other
type
of
criminal
case,
holds
the
ultimate
weapon,
the
edge
for
maximum
success.
"
"the
voir
dire
in
death
cases
gives
you,
the
prosecutor,
certain
unique
opportunities
to
apply
effective
tactics
which
are
unavailable
in
other
criminal
cases.
"
and
this
is
not
the
only
time
prosecutors
have
admitted
that
they
are
aware
of
this.
i
don't
think
there's
any
secret
about
the
effect
that
we
have
here.
the
effect
is
that
the
prosecution,
by
asking
for
the
death
penalty,
can
increase
its
chances
of
getting
a
conviction
beyond
what
they
would
have
been
in
the
same
case
if
the
prosecution
had
not
asked
that
the
defendant
be
executed.
and
we
submit
that
that's
unconstitutional.
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
people
whose
members
of
family
have
been
convicted?
that's
possible.
again,
that
would
depend.
that
strikes
me
as
an
overbroad
exclusion
if
the
purpose
is
the
same
purpose
for
which
states
exclude
felons
themselves.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
state
that
permits
anything
of
this
sort.
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
no,
indeed.
but
as
this
court
held
in--
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
--i
actually
know
of
cases
in
which
defense
attorneys
have
permitted
that,
but
typically
not.
but
that
enough,
as
this
court
has
held
in
smith
versus
phillips,
is
not
enough
to
impute
bias
to
a
juror.
a
showing
of
actual
bias
has
to
be
made
or
peremptories
can
be
exercised.
but
peremptories
are
balanced,
and
this
is
an
unbalancing
process.
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
that
would
avoid
all
of
the
problems
that
we've
identified.
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
i
see
what
you're
saying.
that
might
create
a
small
portion
of
the
problem
that
we
have
here,
because
one
of
the
problems
we
have
here
is--
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
--no,
there
certainly
are.
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
well,
there
are
a
couple
of
possible
procedures.
there
are
several.
but
the
one
that
was
used
in
this
case
was
a
general
voir
dire
by
the
judge,
asking
all
the
jurors,
knowing
that
it
was
a
capital
case,
if
they
would
be
fair
and
impartial
on
guilt
or
innocence.
the
state--
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
--not
at
all.
the
state
could
permit
prosecutors
to
go
beyond
that
and
engage
in
more
extended
inquiry
on
that
issue,
on
the
issue
of
nullification
or
guilt
or
innocence.
increasingly,
i
believe
state
courts
have
tended
to
limit
that
type
of
voir
dire,
but
i
don't
see
any
constitutional
obstacle
to
it.
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
a
state
could
permit
that.
it's
not
required
constitutionally.
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
no,
i
don't
believe
it
would,
your
honor.
i
think
one
of
the
problems
we've
identified...
and
i
think
your
honor
has
that
in
mind...
is
that
the
process
of
asking
questions
about
willingness
to
consider
imposing
the
death
penalty
before
a
determination
of
guilt
is
in
itself
biasing.
that
could
be
minimized.
but
even
if
it
were
left
as
it
is...
and
i
don't
think
it
would
under
any
ruling
upholding
the
eighth
circuit...
that
process
alone
may
not
give
rise
to
a
constitutional
violation.
that
process,
together
with
all
of
the
other
problems
we
have
here,
i
think
certainly
does.
i'd
like
to
say
that,
as
the
court
knows,
this
issue
is
not
entirely
new.
when
the
court
first
addressed
it
in
1968
in
the
witherspoon
case,
i
think
most
lawyers
and
most
judges
believed
that
death
qualification
violates...
or
rather,
creates
biased
juries
on
guilt.
but
the
court
decided
not
to
act
on
that
belief,
to
defer
a
decision.
and
that
was
appropriate
then,
because
it
was
not
proven.
now
matters
have
changed.
it
has
been
proven.
the
evidence
of
it
is
overwhelming,
it's
uncontroversial,
and
it's
well
known.
and
at
this
point,
now
that
we
know
that
death
qualified
juries
are
biased
on
guilt
or
innocence,
to
permit
the
practice
to
continue
would
be
a
very
different
matter
and
it
would,
i
submit,
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
samuel
r.
gross
i
have
no
position
on
that
as
an
advocate
for
mr.
mccree.
but
obviously
it's
of
concern
to
the
court.
the
best
i
can
say
on
that
for
the
court's
information
is,
a
brief
was
filed
on
this
on
behalf
of
mr.
woodard
which
suggests
a
number
of
ways
in
which
retroactivity
could
be
limited,
and
i
think
it
could.
contrary
to
what
general
clark
said,
i
think
only
a
small
minority
of
the
people
who
are
on
death
row
now
would
have
relief
available
to
them
under
this
court's
ruling
in
wainwright
v.
sykes.
i
should
point
out,
as
the
court
very
likely
knows,
that
judge
eisele,
the
district
court
judge
in
this
case,
already
dismissed
one
petition
on
this
issue
because
the
issue
was
not
preserved
in
the
state
courts,
and
the
eighth
circuit
has
done
that
in
two
other
cases.
judge
eisele
also
suggested
that
the
doctrine
of
wainwright
v.
sykes
might
prohibit
applying
this
type
of
relief
to
defendants
who
raised
the
issue
but
did
not
present
any
evidence
on
it,
since
it
had
been
identified
as
a
factual
issue.
so
i
suspect
the
number
of
people
to
whom
it
would
apply
under
existing
court
doctrine
would
be
quite
small,
and
it
could
be
limited
beyond
that,
and
it
could
be
made
non-retroactive
entirely.
thank
you.
