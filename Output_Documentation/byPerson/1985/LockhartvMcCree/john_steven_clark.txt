mr.
john
steven
clark
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
facts
simply
stated
are
these:
ardia
mccree
on
valentine's
day
of
1978,
in
the
course
of
robbing
la
tienda
gift
shop
and
service
station,
killed
evelyn
roughton,
the
owner
operator,
with
a
shotgun
blast
to
her
face.
he
was
charged
with
capital
felony
murder.
the
state
sought
the
death
penalty.
mccree
was
tried
before
a
jury
which
was
qualified
in
accordance
with
witherspoon
and
nine
prospective
jurors
who
would
not
consider
the
full
range
of
punishments
to
include
the
death
penalty
were
removed
for
cause.
mccree
was
found
guilty
and
sentenced
to
life
without
parole.
the
conviction
was
appealed
to
the
arkansas
supreme
court
and
was
affirmed.
mr.
john
steven
clark
he
was
tried
in
ouachita
county,
justice
rehnquist,
where
the
crime
was
committed,
in
camden,
arkansas.
mr.
john
steven
clark
it
is
the
state
judicial
district
which
comprises
two
counties,
union
county
and
ouachita
county,
population
of
about
75,000
together.
post
conviction
relief
was
denied
to
mr.
mccree.
in
1980
he
filed
his
petition
for
habeas
relief,
which
leads
us
to
this
court
today.
i'll
discuss
the
issues
of
impartiality
and
then
cross
section
as
raised
by
mr.
mccree,
but
before
i
undertake
to
analyze
mccree's
particular
constitutional
claims
i
think
it's
important
that
we
put
this
case
in
its
perspective.
this
case
may
be
one
of
the
most
important
criminal
cases
this
court
will
consider
this
term,
for
if
the
decision
below
is
affirmed
the
potential
is
that
some
90
percent
of
those
inmates
who
comprise
death
row,
numbering
1500,
may
have
to
be
retried;
that
in
33
of
the
37
states
that
allow
for
capital
punishment
their
statutes
may
have
to
be
changed
through
special
sessions;
and
that
some
3,000
to
5,000
inmates
minimally
who
were
charged
with
capital
offenses
but
got
sentences
of
less
than
death,
either
life
without
or
life
imprisonment,
may
potentially
be
tried
again.
i
believe
it's
essential
for
those
claims--
mr.
john
steven
clark
--yes,
your
honor.
in
putting
these
claims
in
perspective,
mccree's
basic
complaint
is
that
witherspoon
excludibles
were
barred
from
potential
membership
on
the
jury
that
heard
the
guilt
phase
of
his
trial.
factually,
those
nine
prospective
jurors
were
excluded
due
to
the
requirements
of
two
entirely
neutral
and
unassailable
features
of
arkansas
state
law.
the
first
feature
is
the
state
of
arkansas
has
determined
that
in
criminal
cases
the
issue
of
guilt
and
innocence
should
be
decided
by
the
same
jury,
as
we
believe
that
the
jury
acts
as
a
safeguard,
if
you
will,
in
the
criminal
justice
establishment
between
the
defendant
and
that
establishment:
that
the
policy
and
the
law
that
require
that
has
been
the
policy
in
our
state
for
more
than
seven
decades.
secondly,
the
state
of
arkansas
naturally
decided
to
exercise
its
option,
when
granted
by
witherspoon,
to
prevent
any
juror
from
determining
sentence
who
said
he
would,
explicitly
vowed,
that
he
would
under
no
circumstances
follow
state
law,
which
included
the
penalty
of
death.
mr.
john
steven
clark
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
it
makes
a
difference.
the
state
has--
mr.
john
steven
clark
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
was
the
intent
of
the
state
to
leave
open
an
option
to
procedurally
come
back
and
attempt
to
bar
this
effort.
the
state
of
arkansas
faces
this
fact:
with
some
27
inmates
on
death
row
and
146
other
persons
who
were
charged
with
a
capital
offense
but
got
some
lesser
offense,
the
need
to
determine
factually
whether
the
assertions
of
mccree
are
constitutional,
and
what
we
will
be
facing
if
in
fact
this
court
affirms
the
decision
of
the
court
below.
and
so
in
the
waiver
of
that
procedure
which
we
waived,
and
i
admit
that
to
this
court,
we
thought
we
had
a
chance
to
get
at
the
essence
of
the
merits
of
this
issue
and
get
some
direction
from
this
court
as
to
where
we
should
go
as
a
matter
of
policy.
mr.
john
steven
clark
your
honor,
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes,
that
in
this
instance,
as
with
grigsby
in
the
case
that
was
a
companion
case,
that
they
were
consolidated...
and
as
the
court
may
be
aware,
mr.
grigsby
died
while
he
was
in
prison...
that
in
this
instance
what
we
did
was
we
waived
this
issue
because
of
the
fact
that,
as
i
said,
we
wanted
to
get
to
the
crux
of
the
issue
before
the
court.
mr.
john
steven
clark
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
steven
clark
yes,
your
honor.
we
excused
those
who
said
they
would
not
follow
state
law.
mr.
john
steven
clark
in
the
trial
with
mr.
mccree,
the
verdict
that
was
returned
was
life
without
parole.
the
state
in
that
instance,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
waived.
mr.
john
steven
clark
not
in
mccree,
your
honor.
in
grigsby
that
was
the
case.
in
the
grigsby
trial
we
did--
mr.
john
steven
clark
--not
in
mccree.
mr.
john
steven
clark
yes,
your
honor.
mccree
must
prove
why
it
is
constitutionally
impermissible
for
the
state
of
arkansas
to
follow
both
of
these
rules
at
the
same
time.
he
must
demonstrate
that
the
constitution
requires
that
witherspoon
excludibles
be
eligible
for
the
guilty
phase
in
juries
in
capital
cases.
put
differently,
i
submit
to
this
court
that
mccree
must
show
that
the
constitution
demands
that
jurors
be
eligible
for
the
jury
who
will
not
follow
state
law.
this
court
in
wainwright
and
witt
stated
that
the
party
seeking
to
exclude
jurors
for
bias
has
the
initial
burden
of
establishing
that
bias.
clearly,
arkansas
did
that
here
when
it
discovered
that
those
nine
prospective
jurors
explicitly
vowed
that
they
would
not
follow
state
law.
the
right
to
an
impartial
jury
based
in
the
sixth
and
the
fourteenth
amendments
can
be
defined
best
succinctly,
i
think,
as
the
right
to
have
one's
case
decided
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
presented
and
of
the
instructions
of
the
court.
mccree's
evidence
does
not
even
begin
to
show
jury
bias
within
the
meaning
of
this
court's
opinions.
it
provides
no
basis
whatsoever
for
concern
that
the
jurors
who
voted
to
convict
mccree
violated
their
oaths,
or
that
they
relied
on
something
other
than
the
evidence
presented
or
the
arguments
of
counsel,
or
that
they
disavowed
and
did
not
follow
the
instructions
of
the
court.
in
fact,
mccree
has
presented
no
attack
of
any
kind
on
the
performance
of
his
jurors.
the
key
flaw
in
mccree's
approach
is
its
failure
to
look
at
the
individual
members
of
his
jury
who
actually
decided
his
case.
the
only
fact
that
we
know
about
the
jurors
that
were
not
allowed...
that
were
allowed,
excuse
me,
to
serve,
is
that
they
stated
they
were
willing
to
consider
the
full
range
of
punishments
in
this
case,
which
included
the
death
penalty.
the
fact
that
the
jury
might
possibly
impose
the
death
penalty
alone
if
justified
does
not
establish
that
those
jurors
in
mccree's
case
are
incapable
of
rendering
an
impartial
verdict.
to
the
contrary,
there
is
a
presumption
of
impartiality
which
attaches
to
mccree
and
to
mccree's
jurors
in
particular,
which
arises,
one,
from
the
trial
court's
determination
that
they
were
qualified
to
sit:
and
two,
from
their
stated
oath
they
would
follow
state
law.
mr.
john
steven
clark
your
honor,
if
in
fact
you
were
trying
to
exclude
these
and
identify
them
as
denial
of
a
cross-section
because
they
were
a
distinct
group
and
they
were
recognizable
and
they
were
sizable
and
they
were
systematically
excluded,
perhaps
you
would
be
moving
toward
that
argument,
which
i
will
address
later
in
my
argument
to
this
court.
but
in
this
instance
what
mccree
has
said
and
the
eighth
circuit
sort
of
merged
was
the
impartiality
and
the
cross-section
violation.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
demonstrates
that
mccree's
jurors
were
anything
other
than
impartial.
mr.
john
steven
clark
if
in
fact
in
qualifying
these
jurors
they
were
excused
because
they
were
going
to
be
partial--
mr.
john
steven
clark
--well,
if
you
start
taking
just--
mr.
john
steven
clark
--that's
not
permissible.
mr.
john
steven
clark
that's
not
permissible,
just
to
say
all
democrats
or
all
members
of
associations,
i
don't
think,
because
you
would
have
to
demonstrate
that
they're
not--
mr.
john
steven
clark
--your
honor,
no,
that's
not
the
thrust
of
my
argument.
it's
not
just
that
the
remaining
jury
was
impartial.
it
was
the
fact
that
these
jurors
were
excluded
not
because
of
their
belief
in
the
death
penalty;
they
were
excluded
because
they
would,
they
vowed
explicitly
they
would,
not
follow
state
law.
in
the
court's
example,
if
all
democrats
said,
we
will
not
follow
state
law,
and
that
left
only
republicans,
then
i
think
you'd
have
a
properly
comprised
jury.
if
you
just
excluded
democrats
for
the
reason
they
held
that
title
or
avowed
to
that
certain
political
party,
then
i
think
you're
treading
on
constitutional
violations
that
can
be
demonstrated
by
the
defendant.
mr.
john
steven
clark
well,
your
honor,
if
that
is
the
thrust,
i
would
look
at
it
from
this
standpoint.
the
procedure
is
that
of
a
unitary
system,
a
unitary
jury,
one
that
determined
both
guilt
and
penalty.
it
is
the
policy
of
the
state
of
arkansas,
founded
in
this
state
interest,
that
we
believe
that
same
jury
should
consider
guilt
and
innocence
as
well
as
penalty,
for
we
believe
that
in
fact
it
acts
as
a
safeguard,
as
a
check,
if
you
will,
against
that
criminal
justice
establishment.
mr.
john
steven
clark
i
submit
to
this
court
that
is.
but
in
taking
the
procedural
argument
one
step
further,
what
mccree
does
argue,
your
honor,
is
in
fact
that
the
policy
in
arkansas
is
not
good
policy:
we
don't
like
this
policy
of
the
unitary
jury.
that
is
not
the
same
as,
there
is
a
constitutional
violation
in
this
process,
and
it's
clearly
distinguishable.
if
mr.
mccree
wants
the
policy
changed,
his
proper
forum
is
the
arkansas
legislature
in
changing
that
policy.
but
in
regard
to
the
procedure,
the
state
interest
that
we
determine
that
we
want
to
protect
first
and
foremost
is
that
we
believe
that
jury
does
act
as
that
safeguard
in
that
criminal
justice
establishment
and
it
is
important
that
the
same
jury
hear
guilt
and
punishment
so
as
not
to
diminish
their
responsibility
as
a
juror,
so
that
one
juror
sitting
only
in
the
guilt
phase
says,
i
am
absolved
of
all
concern
and
responsibility
as
to
penalty
because
i
am
not
affected
in
terms
of
making
that
decision,
or
the
reverse
if
you
were
the
penalty
jury.
and
for
those
reasons,
as
well
as
reasons
of
economy
and
efficiency,
but
the
first
one
is
that
state
interest.
without
conceding
the
validity
of
any
of
mccree's
assertions
to
this
court,
as
to
the
mere
existence...
the
issue
as
to
the
mere
existence
of
any
predilection
or
notion
or
concern
by
defendants
in
general,
without
some
other
objective
criteria,
is
to
establish
a
standard
that
allows
them
to
be
excluded
because
of
their
predilection
or
their
notion,
allows
them
to
be
excluded,
is
to
establish
an
impossible
burden
for
the
state
to
meet.
i
implore
this
court
to
consider
this.
eight
out
of
ten
people
in
this
nation
have
support,
based
on
surveys,
of
capital
punishment,
in
arkansas
better
than
nice
out
of
ten.
we
have
said
repeatedly
throughout
this
case,
and
this
court
has
affirmed,
that
we
have
the
right
in
certain
instances
to
exclude
certain
persons
or
professions
from
the
jury:
lawyers,
if
you
will,
doctors
in
some
instances,
in
arkansas
chiropractors,
dentists,
dental
assistants
and
others.
we
have
said
that
that
has
a
legitimate
basis
in
doing
so.
they
perhaps
make
up
a
sizable,
distinct
group
that
may
have
a
predilection
or
some
notion
or
concern
as
to
guilt
or
innocence.
but
if
we
rely
on
social
science
data
to
jump
to
a
legal
conclusion,
you
put
the
burden
on
the
state
of
having
an
impossible
task
of
meeting,
a
jury
that
in
fact
would
be
impartial
as
required
by
the
sixth
amendment.
what
the
constitution
requires
in
not
that
a
jury
have
a
particular
mix
of
viewpoints.
mr.
john
steven
clark
no,
your
honor,
i
would
not
say
that
and
would
never
contend
that.
mr.
john
steven
clark
we
do
not
contend
that,
your
honor.
what
the
constitution
requires
is
not
a
jury
with
a
particular
mix
of
viewpoints
that
the
defendant
would
prefer,
but
a
jury
that
is
made
up
entirely
of
persons
who
will
evaluate
the
evidence--
mr.
john
steven
clark
--specifically,
your
honor,
we
do
exclude
professions:
doctors,
lawyers,
chiropractors,
dentists,
dental
hygienists,
firemen,
christian
scientists.
there's
a
whole
group
that
may
be
excluded,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
steven
clark
your
honor,
it's
matter
of
choice.
it's
not
a
matter
of
mandate.
mr.
john
steven
clark
no
statutory,
except
for
felons,
which
are
disqualified,
which
are
in
fact
disqualified.
mr.
john
steven
clark
no,
sir,
your
honor.
it
is
not
a
statutory
exclusion.
it
is
a
statutory
definition
of
those
who
can
be
excluded.
mr.
john
steven
clark
no,
your
honor,
i
would
not
say
that.
they
do
comprise
juries
from
time
to
time
in
my
state
and
i'm
sure
across
the
country.
but
in
this
instance,
if
you
take
the
rationale
that
is
advanced
by
mccree
and
say
that
you
cannot
distinguish
a
group
because
of
some
single
notion
or
predilection
that
they
have,
then
where
do
you
stop?
where
does
this
court
finish
litigating
that
matter?
because
in
this
instance
this
policy
of
arkansas
has
been
if
you
are
a
doctor
you
can
be
excused,
if
you
are
a
chiropractor
you
can
be
excused,
not
that
you
must
but
you
can
be.
this
may
in
fact
then
rise
to
the
issue
of
some
sizable
group.
it
may
rise
to
the
fact
that
there's
some
distinct
group,
and
may
show
some
effort,
at
least
arguably
from
social
science
data,
as
to
how
they
may
affect
or
predict
actions
on
a
jury
and
be
excluded
for
some
systematic
reason.
what
i
have
argued
to
this
court
is
that
i
would
ask
you
to
consider
sincerely
that
what
the
constitution
requires,
as
i
said,
is
not
a
particular
mix
of
viewpoints,
but
in
fact
a
jury
made
up
entirely
of
persons
who
can
and
will
evaluate
the
evidence
fairly.
it
would
be
folly,
i
submit
to
this
court,
to
go
beyond
that
requirement
and
find
a
jury
bias
in
every
case
where
the
defendant
shows
that
his
jurors'
attitudes
somehow
did
not
perfectly
mirror
the
range
of
attitudes
in
the
general
population.
concerns
of
this
kind
about
the
relative
mix
of
juror
attitudes
on
issues
other
than
matters
to
be
decided
must
be
recognized
under
some
other
constitutional
theory,
i
submit
to
this
court.
the
court
has
recognized...
the
court
below,
excuse
me,
the
eighth
circuit
recognized,
mccree's
claim
that
the
exclusion
of
witherspoon
excludibles
violated
the
constitutional
right
to
a
jury
drawn
from
a
fair
cross-section
of
the
community.
but
i
submit
to
this
court,
in
doing
so
it
seriously
distorted
the
requirements
in
order
to
establish
a
prima
facie
violation.
as
this
court
has
identified,
that
violation
is
shown
when
you
identify
a
group
that
is
distinctive
in
the
community,
one
that
the
representation
of
that
group
is
sizable
in
relation
to
the
rest
of
the
community,
and
that
they're
systematically
excluded.
this
court
has
never
precisely
defined
cognizability,
but
it
is
clear
that
the
court
has
never
found
that
attitude
alone
defined
a
cognizable
group.
there's
no
basis
for
applying
that
requirement,
i
submit,
in
this
cross-sectional
representation,
where
the
excluded
group
shares
only
one
single
attitude.
this
court
has
held
that
the
basic
purpose
of
the
right
to
a
jury
drawn
from
a
fair
cross-section
of
the
community
is
the
furthering
of
that
democratic
function
of
the
jury,
both
by
placing
a
democratic
body
between
the
defendant
and
the
criminal
justice
establishment
and
by
also
making
certain
that
no
segment
of
society
is
barred
from
participating
in
the
criminal
justice
system.
to
that
end,
the
requirement
protects
only
those
groups
that
are
perceived
by
themselves
and
others
as
distinct
in
the
community,
a
distinct
segment
of
that
community.
the
exclusion
of
jurors
who
share
a
single
attitude,
i
submit
to
this
court,
does
not
threaten,
does
not
threaten
the
democratic
function
of
the
jury
and
thus
raise
the
constitutional
issue.
attitudes,
unlike
the
characteristics
that
underlie
the
recognized
groups
that
this
court
has
identified
in
cross-sectional
cases,
are
subject
to
change.
it's
been
firmly
established
that
the
number
of
witherspoon
excludibles
in
the
population
in
dwindling.
the
facts
indicate
that
witherspoon
excludibles
are
not
a
fixed
class,
that
they
very
in
characteristics
by
which
they
are
identified,
and
that
that
variance
is
subject
to
change.
the
classification
of
witherspoon
excludibles
as
a
group
on
the
basis
of
attitude
alone
is
vastly
different
from
those
traditional
classification
characteristics
as
sex
or
origin
or
race.
mr.
john
steven
clark
yes,
your
honor,
there
are
two
issues.
mr.
john
steven
clark
yes,
your
honor,
you
could.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
merged
the
two
issues,
your
honor.
they
merged
the
issues
of
impartiality
and
cross-section
and
said
they
found
that
these
jurors
weren't
impartial,
therefore
a
cross-section
violation.
but
they
are
two
very
distinct
issues.
moreover,
this
court
has
made
it
clear
that
even
if
the
defendant
demonstrates
a
prima
facie
case
of
cross-section
violation,
a
state
is
entitled
to
defend
its
jury
selection
process
by
showing
it
has
some
significant
state
interest
in
that
process.
that
threshold
point
is
that
the
state
has
a
significant
interest
in
arkansas
in
utilizing
the
same
jury
to
make
the
death
penalty
decisions.
that
interest
is
really
not
quantifiable,
but
in
fact
it
is
real.
it
is
real
predicated
on
seven
decades
of
belief
both
in
history
and
tradition
and
a
judgment
in
terms
of
policy,
of
common
sense,
that
juries
in
our
state
represent
an
ability
to
be
that
safeguard,
that
check,
if
you
will,
on
that
criminal
justice
establishment,
and
sitting
as
a
jury
that
they
are
best
able,
sitting
as
the
same
jury,
having
to
know
that
they
bear
the
responsibility
of
adjudicating
guilt
as
well
as
punishment,
that
they
are
best
able
to
make
that
awesome
decision
of
life
or
death.
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
state
has
broad
discretion
in
fashioning
its
own
jury
selection
procedures,
and
that
the
state
must
have
some
leeway
in
prescribing
the
qualifications
relevant
to
jurors
and
provide
a
means
for
reasonably
exemptions.
the
goal
of
a
fair
cross-section
is
never
achieved
at
the
cost
of
leaving
disqualified
jurors
on
a
jury.
for
all
the
reasons
that
i
have
argued
to
the
court
above,
i
would
ask
that
the
decision
below
be
reversed,
and
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
steven
clark
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
will
be
very
brief.
it's
important
to
note
for
this
court
that
the
state
has
not
moved
to
exclude
witherspoon
excludibles
because
of
their
attitude
as
to
the
death
penalty,
but
instead
because
they
will
not
follow
state
law.
the
sixth
amendment
says
that
you're
entitled
to
an
impartial
jury,
that
is
one
that
will
fairly
weigh
the
evidence
presented,
the
arguments
of
counsel,
consider
the
instructions
of
the
court,
and
apply
that
law
to
the
facts
and
the
case.
mr.
john
steven
clark
your
honor,
we
would
consent
that
if
a
juror
says,
who
is
a
witherspoon
excludible,
i
can
follow
state
law,
that
you
can't
strike
them
for
cause
on
that
reason.
we've
never
argued
that
point.
if
that
juror
says
i
will
follow
state
law,
fine.
we
may
strike
him
peremptorily,
but
for
cause
we
don't
have
that
issue.
but
mccree
argues
to
this
court
that
in
fact--
mr.
john
steven
clark
--then
he
must
be
excused
for
cause
because--
mr.
john
steven
clark
--the
policy,
your
honor,
of
our
state
is
for
the
same
jury
to
hear
guilt
and
innocence
as
well
as
penalty,
and
that
policy
i
submit
to
you
is
one
that
is
founded
in
good
constitutional
principle.
secondly,
i
would
argue
to
this
court
that,
though
the
contention
may
be
made
that
mccree's
attack...
really,
the
contention
should
be
made
that
mccree's
attack
is
on
the
procedure.
mccree's
attack
is
that
we
just
don't
like
this
system,
not
that
it's
unconstitutional,
we
think
there's
a
better
way.
in
looking
at
that
attack
and
particularly
in
viewing
it
with
the
issue
of
whether
these
death
qualified
juries
are
distinct
as
compared
to
all
other
ordinary
criminal
juries,
that
is
factually
inaccurate.
in
arkansas,
when
we
qualify
a
jury
in
a
criminal
case
we
repeatedly...
whether
it's
a
drug
case,
it's
a
robbery
case,
it's
a
theft
case,
it's
a
rape
case,
or
it's
a
death
case,
we
want
to
know
if
those
jurors
can
consider
the
full
range
of
punishment.
if
they
cannot,
then
we
submit
that
they
must
be
excused
for
cause.
mr.
john
steven
clark
they
would
be
qualified
in
those
cases
if
they
stated
to
the
court,
your
honor,
they
would
consider
the
full
range
of
punishments.
mr.
john
steven
clark
some
may
state
that,
yes,
your
honor.
in
fact,
some
have,
that
they
could
do
guilt
or
innocence,
but
not
penalty.
mr.
john
steven
clark
you
are
balancing
state
interests,
your
honor.
i
think
that
is
correct.
and
if
in
fact
there
is
a
conviction
proneness,
there
may
be
an
acquittal
proneness.
what
the
issue
is
in
the
sixth
amendment
is,
do
you
get
a
jury
who
will
follow
state
law?
if
they
submit
to
you
that
they
will,
then
in
fact
our
unitary
system
is
constitutional.
mr.
john
steven
clark
i
would
submit
to
this
court
that
that
is
not
the
best
of
all
worlds,
at
least
by
the
policy
determination
in
arkansas,
that
to
set
those
alternates
on
the
jury,
which
we
set,
too,
but
not
in
the
deliberation
phase,
in
case
of
illness
or
emergency,
but
to
divide
that
responsibility,
to
diminish
that
responsibility,
is
not
good
policy,
and
that
we
have
determined
it
not
to
be
good
policy.
and
the
remedy
fashioned
is
really
a
policy
consideration,
not
a
constitutional
violation.
in
addition,
i
make
one
other
point
to
the
court--
mr.
john
steven
clark
--yes,
sir,
i
do.
mr.
john
steven
clark
your
honor,
i
submit
that
when
they
argue
that
they
have
a
constitutional
claim,
their
constitutional
claim
that's
described
by
the
constitution
is
to
an
impartial
jury.
mr.
john
steven
clark
in
this
instance,
by
the
process
that
we
follow
we
only
exclude
those
jurors
who
say
they
cannot
follow
state
law.
had
one
of
mccree's
jurors,
one
of
the
nine
excluded,
said,
i
can
follow
state
law,
we
could
not
have
excused
him
for
cause.
the
record
doesn't
show
they
said
that,
your
honor.
mr.
john
steven
clark
we
are
excusing
them
for
that
reason,
your
honor,
and
we
do
that
because
we
think
that
jury
deliberation
is
the
better
policy,
rather
than
judge
sentencing.
mr.
john
steven
clark
your
honor,
i'm
not
aware
of
whether
we
did
or
not.
i
believe
we
did.
there
are
ten
for
the
government
in
a
capital
case
and
twelve
for
the
defendant,
and
i
believe
that
we
did.
mr.
john
steven
clark
she
tells
me
we
did
not.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
john
steven
clark
we
did
not.
one
other
point
i
would
like--
mr.
john
steven
clark
--yes,
your
honor.
first
the
court
inquired,
and
the
record
i
think
indicates
that
six
jurors
immediately
identified,
because
of
their
belief
on
the
death
penalty,
they
could
not
follow
state
law
and
were
excused.
the
three
others
that
were
excused
were
identified
because
they
could
not
follow
state
law
and
because
at
least
two
of
those
three
had
some
relationship
or
familiarity
with
the
defendant,
which
caused
the
state
to
be
concerned
about
their
objectivity.
mr.
john
steven
clark
nine
total,
your
honor,
six
immediately
by
the
judge.
mr.
john
steven
clark
yes,
your
honor.
the
other
point
i
would
like
to
make
to
this
court--
mr.
john
steven
clark
--your
honor,
i
think
that
procedure
perhaps
could
be
advanced.
mr.
john
steven
clark
we
would
not
have
known,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
john
steven
clark
no,
that's
right.
the
other
point
i
would
make
to
this
court
is
that
there's
a
division
in
the
legal
community
among
prosecutors
as
to
whether
death
qualifying
a
jury
makes
them
conviction
prone.
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
from
prosecutors
in
arkansas
that
disagree
with
others
as
to
the
effect
that
qualifying
a
jury
has
in
terms
of
their
indication
of
adjudication
of
a
verdict
of
guilt
and
innocence.
and
finally,
that
if
the
state
is
not
allowed
to
voir
dire
on
the
issue
of
death,
as
the
question
asked,
then
we
are
facing
a
jury
that
cannot
be
impartial
to
the
state
because
of
the
potential
of
nullifiers,
those
very
persons
who,
because
of
their
opinion
of
the
penalty
of
death,
would
vote
for
an
adjudication
of
innocence
rather
than
guilt,
even
though
the
state
met
its
burden.
for
all
those
reasons,
i
would
ask
that
the
decision
below
be
reversed.
