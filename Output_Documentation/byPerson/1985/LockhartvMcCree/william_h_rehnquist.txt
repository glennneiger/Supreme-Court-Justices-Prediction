justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
clark,
where
in
arkansas
was
mccree
tried?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
where
did
the
venire
come
from,
from
a
particular
state
judicial
circuit
in
that
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general,
when
you
said
that
arkansas
perhaps
excluded
lawyers
or
doctors
and
chiropractors,
were
those
just
hypothetical
examples
or
does
arkansas
in
fact
exclude
certain
occupations?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gross,
you
used
the
expression
"ordinary
jury".
i
would
like
to
have
a
little
bit
better
idea
of
what
you
mean
by
that.
i
understand
from
general
clark
that
ex-felons
are
excluded
from
arkansas
juries.
now,
if
the
same
sort
of
a
survey
was
run
among
ex-felons
in
arkansas
as
was
run
about
witherspoon
excludibles'
attitudes
in
this
case
and
it
were
found
that
ex-felons
were
more
favorable
to
the
defense
than
the
typical
citizen,
would
you
think
that
gave
you
a
constitutional
argument
that
arkansas
had
to
include
ex-felons
on
the
jury?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
an
jury
in
your
view
is
one
that
is
simply
made
up
of
everyone
of
jury
age,
and
then
the
state
must
show
some
justification
for
excluding
any
category?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if,
instead
of...
what
if
you
had
conducted
a
similar
survey
just
in
arkansas
alone
of
witherspoon
excludibles
and
it
showed
that
people
from
little
rock
were
much
more
inclined
to
vote
for
the
defense
in
a
capital
case
than
people
from
camden.
would
that
give
you
a
right
to
argue
that
constitutionally
you
ought
to
have
a
jury
made
up
from
the
entire
state,
rather
than
just
from
camden?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
was
made
for
federal
purposes,
really,
the
sixth
amendment.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
gross,
now,
you
say
it
has
an
actual
biasing
effect,
and
we're
not
talking
about
cross-section.
you
agree
that
no
individual
juror
was
biased?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you're
saying
that
a
jury
can
be
biased
even
though
no
individual
juror
on
it
is
biased?
