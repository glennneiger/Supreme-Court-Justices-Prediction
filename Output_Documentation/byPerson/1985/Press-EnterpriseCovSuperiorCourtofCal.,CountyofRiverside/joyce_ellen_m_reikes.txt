mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
rather
than
begin
with
an
opening
statement
i
would
like
to
bring
to
this
court
the
difference
between
a
preliminary
hearing
and
a
trial,
in
terms
of
the
incentive
of
the
parties
to
prevail.
at
a
trial
we
are
dealing
with
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
defendant.
it
is
in
effect,
in
terms
of
society's
goal,
a
search
for
truth,
for
what
really
happened,
who
committed
this
crime,
and
if
guilt
is
found,
punishment
for
the
guilty.
at
a
preliminary
hearing
we
are
looking
to
determine
probable
cause,
probable
cause
the
crime
was
committed,
and
that
this
defendant
committed
it.
probable
cause
is
sufficient--
ms.
joyce
ellen
m.
reikes
--the
grand
jury
may
also
determine
that
this
person
should
be
indicted
and
charged
with
a
crime.
ms.
joyce
ellen
m.
reikes
i
am
not
familiar
with
what
burden
the
grand
jury
would
consider,
but
i
do
know
that,
for
instance,
one
who
is
indicted
by
the
grand
jury
in
california
still
has
a
right
under
the
penal
code
and
under
hawkins
versus
superior
court
it's
virtually
constitutional
right
under
the
california
constituion
to
a
preliminary
hearing
if
he
wishes
to
have
it.
to
continue,
the
preliminary
hearing,
we
do
not
have
a
situation
as
we
do
at
trial.
at
trial
both
parties
have
an
incentive
to
prevail.
the
district
attorney
is
going
to
pull
out
all
of
his
stops.
the
defendant
is
going
to
do
likewise.
his
life,
his
very
liberty
is
at
stake,
and
in
a
capital
case,
possibly
his
life.
however,
at
a
preliminary
hearing
all
they
are
determining,
all
that
magistrate
is
determining,
is
whether
he
should
be
bound
over
to
stand
trial
or
whether
this
is
an
unwarranted
prosecution
and
it
should
be
cut
off,
if
you
will,
at
the
pass,
right
here.
ms.
joyce
ellen
m.
reikes
it
took
41
days
in
this
case,
i
believe,
and
perhaps
i'm
speculating,
because
there
was
a
good
deal
of
very
highly
technical
medical
information.
in
this
particular
case,
and
i
think
this
is
exemplary
of
preliminary
hearings
in
serious
criminal
cases
generally
in
california,
the
prosecution
put
on
some
25
witnesses.
in
the
supplemental
appendix
in
this
case,
first
30
or
so
pages,
it
contains
a
summary
prepared
by
our
district
attorney
who
tried
the
case,
of
their
testimony.
ms.
joyce
ellen
m.
reikes
there
were
12
victims.
there
were
12
counts,
all
with
special
circumstances,
each
of
which
carried
the
potential
death
penalty.
ms.
joyce
ellen
m.
reikes
i
think
the
prosecutor
here
had
a
highly
technical
case,
again
because
this
is
a
killing
that
was
alleged
to
have
occurred
through
the
use
of
lidocaine.
there
was
a
good
deal,
i
believe,
of
circumstantial
evidence
and
this
had
to
be
shown,
the
effect
of
lidocaine
leaving
the
body
and
how
it
would
affect
the
person's
body
after
so
many
hours.
and
i
believe
that
if
you
look
at
the
supplemental
appendix
that
we
filed
in
this
case,
you
will
see
that
a
good
deal
of
the
testimony
was
not
simply
of
the
nurses
and
other
personnel
with
whom
mr.
diaz,
but
physicians
and
chemists
and
so
forth.
ms.
joyce
ellen
m.
reikes
i
think
that
is
a
decision,
in
the
first
instance,
that
must
be
made
by
the
defendant
and
his
counsel.
does
he
want
to
have
that
hearing
closed,
is
he,
and
does
the
inspector,
of
the
pretrial
publicity
which
will
ultimately
prejudice
the--
ms.
joyce
ellen
m.
reikes
--i
think
the
constitution
requires,
and
there
is
no
question,
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
require
that
state
trials
be
open.
i
think
there
is
no
question
at
this
time
that
the
constitution
does
not
require
that
preliminary
hearings
be
open
to
the
public.
in
california
we
certainly
have
served...
our
legislature
has
served
the
public
interest,
and
it
is
an
important
interest,
a
passionate
interest
in
openness
by
amending
section
868
to
declare
a
statutory
right.
that
first
sentence
of
penal
code
section
868,
a
statute
which
remained
virtually
stable
for
130
years,
it
was
hardly
amended
at
all
except
to
add
some
minor
changes,
that
statute
now
reads
since
1982,
quote,
"the
examination
shall
be
open
and
public."
the
california
supreme
court
as
directed
by
the
legislature,
impliedly,
has
fashioned
a
standard.
it's
a
workable
standard,
and
we
feel
that
this
is
all
that
is
necessary,
to
take
a
defendant's
sixth
amendment
right
which
as
justice
burger
said
in
press
enterprises
1984
case,
no
right
ranks
higher.
and
to
subject
it
to
a
competing
constitutional
right
for
which
we
can
see
no
basis
to
declare
is
to
in
a
sense
dilute
the
defendant's
right
at
that
point,
to
place
upon
the
defendant
the
burden
of
fulfilling
a
constitutional
standard
at
a
very
early
stage
in
the
proceeding
when
he
may
not
be
able
to
do
this,
when
the
spectre
of
pretrial
publicity
may
be
looming
before
him
but
may
not
be
concrete
enough
that
he
can
show
to
the
court
to
fulfill
a
standard
of
an
overriding
governmental
or
a
compelling--
ms.
joyce
ellen
m.
reikes
--the
preliminary
hearing
may
be
closed
upon
the
request
of
the
prosecutor,
only
to
exclude
a
particular
witness,
and
that
is
a
statute
which
is
due
to
expire,
i
believe
january--
ms.
joyce
ellen
m.
reikes
--what
you're
really
talking
about
is
like
the
situation
that
occurred
in
waller
versus
georgia.
i
think
there
the
defendant
has
certainly
a
sixth
amendment
concern
if
the
closure
will
affect
his
right
to
trial.
ms.
joyce
ellen
m.
reikes
yes.
ms.
joyce
ellen
m.
reikes
i
believe
that
he
would,
and
again
where--
ms.
joyce
ellen
m.
reikes
--the
press
in
a
suppression
of
evidence
hearing
under
waller,
the
way
i
read
it,
does
have
that
first
amendment
right.
ms.
joyce
ellen
m.
reikes
if
a
preliminary
hearing
encompasses
a
motion
to
suppress,
in
other
words,
if
one
is
made
during
the
course
of
the
preliminary
hearing,
certainly
a
motion
can
be
made
to
open
that
portion.
because
the
suppression
hearing
unquestionably
is
different
than
the
preliminary
hearing
itself.
there,
like
a
trial,
both
sides
have
the
incentive
to
prevail.
i
believe
the
court
pointed
this
out
in
gannett.
both
sides
have
the
incentive
to
prevail,
whereas
at
a
preliminary
hearing
you
do
not
have
this
two-sided
presentation
of
evidence.
there
is
not
the
two-sided,
the
bilateral
incentive
to
prevail.
ms.
joyce
ellen
m.
reikes
unquestionably
that's
true.
however,
this
is
an
early
stage
of
the
proceedings
where
the
district
attorney...
the
prosecutor
may
have
taken
some
months
in
building
his
case
to
the
point
where
he
files
a
complaint,
seeks
an
arrest
and
so
forth,
where
the
defendant
is
newly
arrested.
a
preliminary
hearing
in
california
may
take
place
as
early...
it
doesn't
often,
but
it
may
take
place
under
the
statute
as
early
as
two
days
after
arraignment,
at
which
time
the
defendant
hasn't
really
had
a
chance
to
prepare
his
defense.
and
so,
if
the
defendant
is
sitting
there
at
a
preliminary
hearing
and
he's
pretty
sure,
or
his
counsel
is,
that
he
is
going
to
be
bound
over,
he
is
not
going
to,
as
mr.
diaz
did
not,
put
on
witnesses.
mr.
diaz
did
not
put
on,
not
one
witness.
ms.
joyce
ellen
m.
reikes
certainly.
interestingly,
there
was
an
article
in
the
riverside
press-enterprise
just
last
week.
there
is
an
elementary
schoolteacher,
a
male
teacher
in
riverside
right
now,
who
has
been
accused
by
a
complaint
from
the
district
attorney
of
child
molestation
of
some
20
or
so
young
children,
and
his
attorney
in
speaking
to
the
newspaper
reporters
told
them
that,
"this
time
in
the
preliminary
hearing
we're
going
to
do
it
differently."
"we're
going
to
go
for
a
dismissal."
"we're
going
to
put
on
a
full
case."
so,
apparently
the
putting
on
of
the
full
case
at
the
preliminary
hearing
is
the
exception
rather
than
the
rule,
at
least
in
our
neighborhood.
ms.
joyce
ellen

honor.
i'm
not
saying
that
they
lay
down
on
the
job,
no.
ms.
joyce
ellen

the
defendant
does
that,
as
i
understand
it,
and
as
i
understand
it
from
real
party
in
interest
brief,
as
a
matter
of
defense
strategy,
the
purpose
being
to
save
his
case
for
trial.
when
he
is
in
a
situation--
ms.
joyce

m.

--no.
i
would
think...
i
can't
speak
for
defense
counsel
and
i'm
not
a
criminal
lawyer,
but
i
would
think
that
if
any
counsel
has
a
chance
of
getting
his
client
off
at
the
preliminary
hearing
he
would
go
for
it.
i
would.
ms.

that's
right.
ms.

i've
never
met

situation
and
i

to
answer
because
i...
if
you
will
take
it
in
the
context
that
i
am
not
sure,
i
would
imagine
the
indictment
would
be
quashed
but
i
don't
know
for
certain.
ms.

i'm
not

ms.
joyce
ellen

i
think
it
has
a
utility
again,
the
same
way
it
did
at
common
law.
i
don't
know
what
the
statistics
are
as
far
as
how
many
dismissals
result
from
preliminary
hearings
and
how
many
people
are
bound
over,
percentage
wise,
but
i
think
it
still
has
tremendous
societal
interest,
in
being
a
check
on
the
prosecutor
in
terms
of
cutting
off
unwarranted
prosecutions.
it
certainly
is
a
discovery
proceeding
for
the
defendant
in
terms
of
seeing
the
demeanor
of
the
district
attorney's
witnesses
and
so
forth,
and
some
of
his
case.
ms.
joyce
ellen
m.
reikes
not
every
interest,
justice
blackmun,
is...
should
be
embellished,
or
worthy,
or
elevated
to
a
constitutional
right.
we
do
not
here
see
a
basis
for
declaring
a
constitutional
right,
either
in
history
or
in
the
constitution
itself.
there
are
a
number
of
interests
in
this
country
that
are
passionate
interests
in
this
society,
that
have
never
been
elevated
to
a
federal
constitutional
right.
this
court
in
san
antonio
versus
rodriguez
in
1973
spoke
of
public
education
and
found
that
it
is
not
a
right.
ms.
joyce
ellen
m.
reikes
i
realize
we
are,
and
perhaps
it
was
a
bad
analogy.
ms.
joyce
ellen
m.
reikes
but
i
see
in
the
bill
of
rights,
i
see
no
basis
for
implying
in
any
way,
certainly
not
expressed,
the
bill
of
rights
nowhere
discusses
the
preliminary
hearing.
certainly
the
preliminary
hearing
was
known
in
the
early
colonies.
it
literally
crossed
the
ocean,
i
think,
with
the
colonists.
ms.
joyce
ellen
m.
reikes
i
cannot
say
which
was
used
more
or
which
was
used
less.
the
only
thing
i
do
know
is
that
it
existed
in
the
colonies,
one,
and
number
two,
when
the
framers
put
together
the
bill
of
rights
they
did
not
include
it.
they
did,
however,
include
it
in
the
grand
jury
indictment
in
the
fifth
amendment.
additionally,
what
is
even
more
interesting
is
that
this
court
through
its
doctrine
of
selective
incorporation
has
never
incorporated
the
grand
jury
right
to
the
states
through
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it
is
one
of
the
very
few
provisions
of
the
bill
of
rights
or
the
first
state
amendments
that
has
not
been
so
incorporated.
ms.
joyce

forgive
me,
justice

ms.
joyce
ellen
m.

in
terms
of
a
grand
jury
indictment,
i
do
not
know,
chief
justice

however,
where
it
is
an
information
filed
by
the
prosecutor,
in
other
words
a
criminal
complaint,
there
are
many
instances,
i
am
told
by
criminal
lawyers,
that
that
occurs.
this
case
is
an
example.
mr.
diaz
submitted
some
five
exhibits.
i'm
not
sure
what
they
are.
however,
the
record
which
the
court
has
of
the
preliminary
hearings,
some
4400
pages,
i
think,
contains
not
one
witness.
he
put
on
no
witnesses.
ms.
joyce
ellen
m.

i
do
not
see
how
he
would
meet
his
burden
of
probable
cause
if
he
did.
ms.
joyce
ellen
m.
reikes
that's
correct.
ms.
joyce
ellen
m.
reikes
insofar
as
i'm
aware,
plus
exhibits.
in
other
words,
the
same
type
of
evidence
that
would
be
admissible
at
trial,
in
california
we
do
not
allow
evidence
that
would
be
inadmissible
at
trial
to
be
admitted
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
our
evidence
code
deals
with
that
specifically.
ms.
joyce
ellen
m.
reikes
that's
correct,
yes.
ms.
joyce
ellen
m.
reikes
i
do
know
that
we...
i
don't
know
the
specific
code
section.
i
believe
there
was
an
experimental
pilot
program
under
the
rules
of
court
in
california.
ms.
joyce
ellen
m.
reikes
i
believe
there
probably
is,
but
i...
and
i
believe
there
may
have
been
that
in
mr.
diaz's
trial
because
i
believe...
and
i'm
not
entirely
sure,
i
believe
i
remember
seeing
parts
of
it
on
tv
myself,
but
it's
something
that
i
am
just
not
familiar
with
at
this
point.
i
do
know
that
there
were
a
number
of
requests
in
this
case
for
press
coverage
of
the
trial,
all
of
which
were
granted.
in
this
case,
i
think
again
and
i
cannot
emphasize
this
strongly
enough,
that
we
must
consider
what
happens
when
a
pretrial
hearing
is
open
and
there
is
significant
pretrial
publicity.
we
now
have
a
defendant
who
is
being
trial
before
a
pool
of...
or
of
jurors
taken
from
a
pool
who
may
or
may
not
have
unconscious
or
conscious
prejudices.
certainly
if
they
have
conscious
prejudices
i
would
expect
that
they
would
reveal
that
on
voir
dire
and
they
would
be
challenged
and
removed.
however,
do
we
really
know
what
the
effect
of
pretrial
publicity
is
on
anyone's
mind?
and
i
submit
that
we
cannot
really
know
that.
certainly
if
we
have
a
case
in
which
there
is
an
acquittal
we
may
safely
presume
that
the
defendant
was
not
adversely
prejudiced.
however,
in
a
case
where
he
is
convicted,
perhaps
we
can
never
be
able
to
show
that
prejudice
like
we
did
in
rideaux
versus
louisiana,
to
the
level
of
a
reversal
or
reversible
error,
but
maybe
it
is
still
there
and
we
have
no
way
of
ever
discerning
that.
i
think,
is
this
court
pointed
out
in
sheppard
versus
maxwell,
we
have
a
number
of
palliatives.
we
have
a
number
of
things
that
may
cure
pretrial
prejudice
to
that
defendant
in
terms
of
what
it
has
done
to
jury,
or
potential
jury.

the
record...
it
was
very
spare,
admittedly,
but
he
said
there
has
been
national
publicity.
there
was
a
concern
there.
he
felt
that
there
had
been...
and
he
said
that
perhaps
after
the
fact
of
the
time
he
sealed
the
transcript
at
the
end
of
the
preliminary
hearing--
ms.
joyce
ellen
m.
reikes
--the
defendant's
fair
trial
rights.
ms.
joyce
ellen
m.
reikes
the
defendant's
fair
trial...
right
to
a
fair
trial,
to
protect
him
from
that
publicity,
yes.
ms.
joyce
ellen
m.
reikes
yes,
at
that
time.
however,
the
standard
remains,
california
has
taken
that
public
interest
and
embodied
it
in
a
statutory
right.
petitioner
in
this
case,
and
it's...
have
indicated
in
one
way
or
another
in
some
of
their
briefs
that
their
fear
is
that
if
we
have
merely
a
statutory
right
as
opposed
to
a
constitutional
right,
that
what
the
legislature
have
given,
if
you
will,
the
legislature
may
take
away.
we
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
in
california.
the
legislature
has
given
this
right.
california
is
a
vocal
state
in
terms
of
its
citizenry
as
i'm
sure
this
court
is
aware.
it
is
a
rare
election
that
we
do
not
have
a
ballot
proposition.
we
have
changed
our
constitution,
or
i
should
say
attempted
to
change
it
before
reichtman
versus
molke
in
that
state,
via
a
ballot
proposition.
i
can
see
people
being
heard
in
the
legislature,
being
heard
at
the
ballot
box,
should
that
public
interest
in
openness
ever
be
attempted
by
the
legislature
to
be
quashed.
i
do
not
think
it
will
be.
i
think
the
fear
is
unrealistic.
i
think,
however,
that
the
press's
characterization
of
the
problem
of
pretrial
publicity
in
terms
of
its
potential
to
prejudice
a
defendant's
right
to
a
fair
trial,
in
the
unusual
case...
this
is
not
in
every
case...
in
the
unusual
circumstance,
a
case
like
the
diaz
case,
an
unusual
kind
of
crime
that
attracted
nationwide
interest,
i
think
we
have
a
situation
there
where
that
defendant
must
be
protected.
california
has
protected
his
right
to
a
fair
trial.
california
has
recognized
the
public
interest.
we
feel
that
that
is
all
that
is
warranted.
ms.
joyce
ellen
m.
reikes
we
see
no
basis
for
even
declaring
one.
ms.
joyce
ellen
m.
reikes
it
does.
however,
the
petitioner--
ms.
joyce
ellen
m.
reikes
--the
statute
does
not
specifically
require
that
the
magistrate
make
findings.
however,
i
think
that
it
is
incumbent
upon
any
judge
to
make
findings
so
that
a
higher
court
will
know
what
he
has
done.
ms.
joyce
ellen
m.
reikes
yes,
they
did.
ms.
joyce
ellen
m.
reikes
i'm
not
sure
if
the
attorney
general
in
his
amicus
brief
asked
for
a
remand.
i
believe
that
the
district
attorney
did.
ms.
joyce
ellen
m.
reikes
and
the
real
party
in
interest
also
asks
for
that
same
remand.
i
would
have
no
objection
to
a
remand,
were
that
to
be
found,
but
again
our
initial
objection
is
that
the
right
does
not
exist,
has
no
basis
for
existing.
a
statutory
right,
certainly.
a
right,
the
sixth
amendment
right
of
that
defendant,
particularly
at
that
early
stage
of
the
proceeding,
must
remain
paramount.
and
california
recognizes
the
interest
but
we
feel
in
california
that
it
has
been
adequately
taken
care
of.
thank
you.
