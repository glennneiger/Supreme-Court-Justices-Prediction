unknown
speaker
which
preliminary
hearing
lasted
41
days?
unknown
speaker
what
do
they
have,
magistrates
or
judges
sitting
on
those
things?
unknown
speaker
well,
does
the
defendant
take
the
opportunity
to
cross
examine
witnesses
the
way
he
would
at
a
trial?
my
own
experience
in
arizona
would
indicate
that
they
did
not.
you
don't
want...
let
me
ask
you
another...
does
the
defendant
put
on
witnesses
of
his
own?
unknown
speaker
but
do
you
have
grand
juries
in
california?
unknown
speaker
and
how
do
they
function
in
relationship
to
the
preliminary
hearing?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
result
of
the
preliminary
hearing?
unknown
speaker
similar
to
the
indictment?
unknown
speaker
it's
just
about
duplicative
of
the
indictment?
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
except
both
sides
can
fill
in?
unknown
speaker
under
this
claim--
--during
the
preliminary
hearing,
can
motions
to
suppress
be
made?
unknown
speaker
and
ruled
on?
unknown
speaker
how
about
a
motion
to
dismiss?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
difference
between
a
preliminary
hearing
and
a
trial?
unknown
speaker
but
the
burden
of
proof
is
different?
unknown
speaker
oh,
really?
unknown
speaker
does
the
magistrate
have
to
find
probable
cause
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
prosecutor
needn't
put
on
more
evidence
than
he
thinks
necessary
to
show
probable
cause?
unknown
speaker
and
often
the
defendant
never
puts
on
any
evidence
at
all?
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
then
there's
a
guilty
plea
or
something,
a
plea
bargain?
unknown
speaker
mr.
ward,
is
there
any
other
state
to
your
knowledge
in
which
a
grand
jury
indictment
must
be
followed
by
a
preliminary
hearing,
as
in
california?
unknown
speaker
i've
not
heard
of
another
state.
unknown
speaker
do
you
argue
that
the
grand
jury
proceeding
must
be
open
to
the
press?
unknown
speaker
but
you'll
be
back
next
year
to
argue?
unknown
speaker
well,
a
grand
jury
proceeding
can
be
characterized,
many
of
the
same
attributes
that
you
attribute
to
the
preliminary
hearing.
unknown
speaker
mr.
ward,
to
merely
cut
it,
the
grand
jury
in
california
and
the
preliminary
hearing
both
accomplished
the
same
results?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
the
grand
jury
brings
up
an
indictment?
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
trying
to...
i'm
trying
to...
say
you're
entitled
to
go
to
one
but
not
the
other?
unknown
speaker
--a
one
sentence
reason,
why
you're
entitled
to
go
to
the
preliminary
hearing
but
not
to
go
before
the
grand
jury.
unknown
speaker
but
do
you
have
to
go
as
far
as
say
it's
not
the
judiciary--
unknown
speaker
--court
there
be,
could
there
be
some
preliminary
hearing
in
which
the
court
could
be
justified
in
the
exercise
of
discretion
to
close
it
to
the
public?
unknown
speaker
that,
i
take
it,
means
that
a
hearing
on
closure
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
what,
mr.
ward,
if
the
person
seeking
closure,
the
defendant,
says,
having
this
preliminary
hearing
in
riverside
county
is
going
to
prejudice
my
chancre
of
a
fair
trial
in
riverside
county.
would
the
superior
court
judge
in
riverside
county
have
to
say,
well,
we
could
transfer
it
to
yolow
county
to
try
it.
would
you
say
he
would
have
to
go
that
far
in
order
to...
he
would
have
to
accept
that
sort
of
an
alternative
rather
than
close
the
preliminary
hearing?
unknown
speaker
so,
the
defendant
would
have
to
be
tried
in
a
county
in
a
different
part
of
the
state
so
that
the
riverside
county
proceeding
could
be
opened
up
to
the
press?
that's
what
you're
saying.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
you're
saying,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
ward,
i
share
justice
o'connor's
feeling
that
california
must
be
the
only
state
in
which
a
preliminary
hearing
is
a
matter
of
right
after
an
indictment.
i
don't
think
that
kind
of
thing
prevails
elsewhere
in
these
united
states.
i
suppose
you
wish
the
term
were
not
"preliminary",
period.
it
certainly
is
different
from
a
preliminary
hearing
elsewhere,
outside
california,
and
you're
swimming
upstream
with
that
term
"preliminary
hearing",
as
you
refer
to
the
chief
justice's
special
writing
in
gannett,
for
instance,
where
he
emphasized
the
pre-nature
of
a
pretrial
or
preliminary
hearing.
unknown
speaker
all
i
am
saying
is,
i
think
you
must
wish
you
had
a
different
title
for
the
procedure
that
you
have
in
california.
unknown
speaker
that
history
has
been
gone
over
in
these
other
cases.
i
don't
think
we
have
to
worry
about
it.
i
think
we
have
it
in
mind.
unknown
speaker
some
of
us
do
anyway.
unknown
speaker
would
you
think,
mr.
warren,
that
one
of
the
reasonable
candidates
for
closure
would
be
the
motion
to
suppress
evidence
in
the
california
procedure?
unknown
speaker
let
me
put
the
question
another
way.
is
it
within
the
discretion,
sound
judicial
discretion
of
the
trial
judge,
the
person
presiding,
the
person
presiding
over
the
preliminary
hearing
to
say
that
if
all
the
evidence
which
is
sought
to
be
suppressed
is
disclose
and
is
on
the
evening
newspapers
and
television
stations,
it's
going
to
impair
the
right
of
the
defendant
to
a
fair
trial
if
the
evidence
is
suppressed
at
the
preliminary
hearing?
unknown
speaker
let
me
get
back
to
my
question.
are
you
saying
it
is
not
within
the
discretion
of
the
court
to
close
on
that
ground?
unknown
speaker
mr.
ward,
can
i
go
back
to
one
thing
that
troubles
me.
you've
been
arguing
about
access
to
the
hearing
and
not
access
to
the
transcript,
and
i
guess
you
relief
have
both
problems
in
this
case,
the
hearing...
closing
the
hearing
and
originally
denying
access
to
the
transcripts.
and
in
the
court's
response
they
argue,
you've
got
the
wrong
party
here,
it
was
the
municipal
court
that
closed
the
hearing
and
the
superior
court
that
denied
access
to
the
transcript.
what's
your
response
to
that,
the
appeal
from
the
closure
order
itself,
i
mean,
the
review
of
it?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
so,
what
is
specifically
before
us
is
the
refusal
to
grant
access
to
the
transcript,
when
you
say
that
in
effect
a
fortiori
if
you
were
entitled
to
the
transcript
we
should
at
least
have
to
decide
the
other
issue
to
decide
that
one,
that's
what
you--
unknown
speaker
--but
at
least
it
would
be
possible
to
hold
that
you
were
entitled
to
the
transcript
but
you
were
not
entitled
to
be
physically
present
in
the
courtroom?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
have
another
problem
about
the
grand
jury
being
a
part
of
the
judiciary
hearing.
in
the
regular
hearings
in
most
states
you
have
a
preliminary
hearing
and
at
the
preliminary
hearing
they
bind
you
over
to
the
grand
jury.
well,
as
i
understand,
your
rule
is
that
the
preliminary
hearing
is
a
part
of
the
judicial
procedure
but
the
grand
jury
is
not.
that
makes
a
hiatus
between
the
two.
unknown
speaker
does
that
bother
you?
unknown
speaker
but
you
consider
the
grand
jury
as
sort
of
an
exception
to
the
rule?
unknown
speaker
because
you
know,
sometimes
in
the
preliminary
hearing
in
both
places,
if
certain
cases
like
possession
of
cocaine,
if
you
lose
a
suppression
hearing
you
lose
your
case.
unknown
speaker
if
you
have
the
transcripts
a
little
bit
later
on,
is
there
any
problem
about
that?
unknown
speaker
second
best?
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
there...
seriously,
isn't
the
transcript
going
to
be
more
accurate
than
what
some
person
can
take
down
in
longhand
when
he's
hearing
testimony?
unknown
speaker
you
want
to
print
a
picture
of
the
defendant
with
his
hands
over
his
face,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
don't
you
want
to
print
a
picture
of
the
defendant
with
his
hands
over
his
face,
trying
to
prevent
being
photographed?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
ward,
i
don't
suppose
if
you're
worried...
not
worried,
but
if
you
think
an
important
part
of
your
submission
is
that
preliminary
hearings
really
dispose
of
a
very
high
percentage
of
all
the
cases,
that
literally
isn't
true,
something
has
to
happen
after
the
preliminary
hearing
and
when
cases
are
disposed
of
later,
or
without
a
trial,
something
else
has
happened,
there's
been
a
plea
bargain,
and
there's
been
bargaining,
there's
been
a
process
going
on.
i
would
think
you'd
be
much
more
interested
in
that
process
which
actually
disposes
of
the
case,
than
with
the
preliminary
hearing.
unknown
speaker
well,
wouldn't
you
think...
would
you
make
some
claim
of
access
to
the
plea
bargaining
process?
unknown
speaker
adjudicatory?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
whether
any
judges
in
california
sit
in
on
plea
bargaining
negotiations?
unknown
speaker
and
there
is
the
judge
and
there
is
where
the
meat
may
be
out...
i
suppose
your
next
claim
would
be
to
sit
in
on
those?
unknown
speaker
i
know
you
don't
now,
but
as
justice
o'connor
says,
you
may
be
here
tomorrow
on
that?
unknown
speaker
i
think
the
logic
of
your
argument
would
say,
a
fortiori
we
should
get
in
on
the
real
bargaining.
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course,
the
community
can
remedy
its
outrage
by
requiring
that
the
proceedings
be
open,
if
really
the
majority
is
outraged.
your
hypothesis
is
really,
the
majority
has
decided
otherwise
so
you
have
to
put
it
on
a
constitutional
basis.
unknown
speaker
what
is
it,
counsel,
that
you
said
took
14
months,
a
moment
ago?
unknown
speaker
the
preliminary
hearing
took
14
months?
unknown
speaker
what
does
the
grand
jury
do
before
that
in
california?
what
do
they
determine?
unknown
speaker
is
that
not
a
determination
of
probable
cause
in
california?
unknown
speaker
but
then,
why
does
it
take
41
days?
unknown
speaker
was
that
because
there
were
a
number
of
alleged
victims?
unknown
speaker
on
the
practical
side
of
it,
does
that
mean
that
the
prosecutor
is
trying
to
make
out
such
a
strong
case
that
there
be
a
guilty
plea
without
a
trial?
unknown
speaker
ms.
reikes,
do
you
think
there
are
any
differences
at
stake
here
in
opening
a
hearing
itself
and
giving
access
subsequently
to
the
transcript
of
the
preliminary
hearing?
unknown
speaker
i'm
talking
about
for
our
purposes,
and
for
purposes
of
determining
what
the
constitution
requires.
unknown
speaker
in
california
may
a
preliminary
hearing
be
closed
over
the
objection
of
the
defendant?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about...
do
you
agree
that
in
order
to
sustain
a
statute
like
that,
or
a
ruling
like
that,
that
the
sixth
amendment
is
involved,
that
the
defendant
says,
"i
don't
want
this
hearing
closed
at
all,
any
part
of
it,
even
for
that
witness,
and
i
have
a
sixth
amendment
right
to
an
open
and
public
trial."
now,
do
you
agree
that
to
that
extent
it's
covered
by--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
think
that
the
result,
in
my
example,
should
be
the
result
that
was
reached
in
waller?
unknown
speaker
so,
if
a
motion
to
suppress
were
made
at
the
preliminary
hearing
in
california
and
the
defendant
wanted
the
proceeding
open,
he
would
have
that
right
under
the
sixth
amendment?
absent
the
findings?
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
say
the
press
does
not
have
an
equivalent?
unknown
speaker
so,
to
the
extent
that
the
preliminary
hearing
involves
motions
to
suppress,
there
has
to
be
a
different
result?
unknown
speaker
well,
yet,
the
defendant
surely
has
an
incentive
to
ask
the
magistrate
to
hold
there
is
no
probable
cause
to
bind
over.
unknown
speaker
he
may
not
go
all
out
to
do
the
best
he
can
to
prevent
himself
from
being
bound
over
but
he
will
at
least
hold
that
the
magistrate
determines
there
is
no
probable
cause,
don't
he?
he
wants
that
outcome.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
defense
counsel
will
agree
with
you
at
all.
you
are
saying
that
they
lay
down
on
the
job?
unknown
speaker
i
misunderstood
you.
you
said
that
the
prosecutor
was
out
to
do
this,
he
did
like...
but
the
defendant
just
went
along?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
that
if
he
has
a
chance
of
getting
his
man
off
at
the
preliminary
he
will
not
do
it?
unknown
speaker
in
that
connection,
i
think
you
told
as
earlier
that
there
might
be
a
preliminary
hearing
following
an
indictment
if
the
accused
wants
it?
unknown
speaker
now,
what
happens
if
at
the
preliminary
hearing
he's
told
the
action
will
be
dismissed?
what
happens
to
the
indictment?
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
you
do
not
know
of
any
case
where
the
preliminary
hearing
resulted
in
negative
for
the
prosecution?
unknown
speaker
then
it
would
seem
that
the
preliminary
hearing
has
a
limited
utility?
unknown
speaker
but
if
it
has
a
tremendous
societal
interest,
why
shouldn't
it
be
open?
unknown
speaker
we're
talking
about
the
bill
of
rights
here.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
you
have
to
face.
unknown
speaker
how
widely
was
it
used
in
those
days,
as
opposed
to
grand
jury
indictments?
unknown
speaker
oh,
it
isn't
very
few.
there
are
many
others.
unknown
speaker
does
it
often
happen,
or
does
it
ever
happen
that
the
prosecution
simply
puts
on
no
evidence
at
the
preliminary
hearing
and
simply
stands
on
the
grand
jury
indictment?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
the
chief
justice's
question
as
directed,
whether
the
prosecutor...
unless
i'm...
whether
the
prosecutor
simply
stood
on
an
information
or
indictment
if
that's
permissible
without
putting
on
witnesses.
is
that
permissible
at
all?
unknown
speaker
especially
when
the
defendant
demands
a
preliminary
hearing.
unknown
speaker
so,
it
has
to
be
live
witnesses
at
a
preliminary
hearing?
unknown
speaker
so
that
is
a
distinction,
then,
from
the
grand
jury
proceedings?
unknown
speaker
what
is...
what
provision
is
there
under
california
law
for
television
access
to
trials?
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
there's
no
regular,
ongoing
procedure
for
televising
criminal
trials?
unknown
speaker
way
not
close
them
all?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
on
the
argument
that
you
are
now
making?
unknown
speaker
what
you
recommend
is
not
that
the
state
close
it
but
that
the
defendant
close?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
reasonable
likelihood
of
prejudice
in
this
case
that
this
court
found?
unknown
speaker
i
was
asking...
my
question
was,
the
defendants
had
closed
the
trial.
what
reason
did
the
judge
give
for
closing
the
hearing?
unknown
speaker
what
was
it?
unknown
speaker
and
that
was
the
only
reason
given?
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
your
argument,
though,
you
are
saying
that
there
is
no
first
amendment
right
at
all
to
access?
unknown
speaker
let's
assume
we
disagree
with
you.
i
take
it
that
your
position
is
that
the
statute
adequately
protects
any
first
amendment
right?
unknown
speaker
there
has
to
be
some
findings,
now,
under
you
'82
amendment?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
higher...
the
california
supreme
court
said
that
the
statutory
requirement
for
closure
was
satisfied
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
we
disagree
with
you
on
the
applicability
of
the
first
amendment,
or
the
existence
of
a
first
amendment
right
to
access?
should
we
remand?
after
all,
your
attorney
general,
doesn't
your...
what's
your
attorney
general's
position?
unknown
speaker
yes,
he
does.
he
says
there's
an
error,
the
court
erred
in
not
finding
a
first
amendment
right
and
says
that
the...
we
should
remand.
unknown
speaker
that's
the
answer
to
my
question.
what
happens
to
the
indictment
if
there's...
if
it's
followed
by
a
preliminary
hearing
and
they
dismiss
it?
unknown
speaker
how
is
that
done,
by
court
decision?
unknown
speaker
it
just
neutralizes
and
negates
and
overrules
the
indictment,
then?
unknown
speaker
well,
what's
your
standard,
if
we
agree
with
you
