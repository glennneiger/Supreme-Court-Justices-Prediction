mr.
james
d.
ward
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
is
a
court
closure
case
involving
specifically
the
question
of
access
to
the
preliminary
hearing
in
a
criminal
case.
we
are
asking
this
court
to
pronounce
that
because
of
societal
and
structural
values
attached
to
openness,
and
the
values
attached
to
the
preliminary
hearing
specifically,
the
constitutional
right
of
access
be
declared
to
the
courtroom
during
the
preliminary
hearing.
we
further
seek
a
determination
by
this
court
that
the
standard
set
forth
by
the
california
supreme
court
for
closure
does
not
conform
to
the
standards
of
this
court.
in
the
case
below,
robert
diaz,
a
nurse,
was
charged
with
the
murder
of
12
hospital
patients
by
administering
massive
doses
of
the
heart
drug,
lidocaine.
at
the
time
of
the
preliminary
hearing
representatives
of
the
media
were
present.
mr.
diaz's
motion
under
california
penal
code
section
868
brought
an
order
from
the
court
for
closure
of
the
proceedings.
after
the
preliminary,
which
lasted
for
41
days,
and
after
which
the
defendant
was
held
to
answer--
mr.
james
d.
ward
--yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
this
preliminary
lasted
41
days.
preliminaries
in
california
from
time
to
time,
not
uncommonly
now,
assume
rather
lengthy
proportions.
one
just
completed
lasted
in
excess
of
14
months.
mr.
james
d.
ward
perhaps,
justice
burger,
it
has
to
do
with
the
importance
that
we
attach
to
the
preliminary
hearing
in
california.
the
entire
matter
is
litigated
at
that
time.
the
defendant
receives
all
of
the
rights
accompanying
a
defendant
in
a
trial
of
an
action.
the
magistrate
is
given
virtually
the
same
powers
that
are
given
to
the
trial
judge
in
connection
with
the
action,
and
the
matters
are
extensively
litigated
in
many
preliminary
hearings
in
california.
mr.
james
d.
ward
the
defendant
has
the
right
to
put
on
witnesses,
and
it
does
occur.
i
cannot
represent
that
it
is
a
common
occurrence.
it
does
occur
that
the
defense
will
put
on
a
case,
and
most
assuredly
there
is
cross
examination.
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
it
is
used
as
a
time
to
test
the
prosecution's
case,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
james
d.
ward
yes,
we
do,
justice
powell.
mr.
james
d.
ward
grand
juries
in
california
are
deemed
by
our
court
to
be
nothing
but
extensions
of
the
arm
of
the
prosecution,
and
even
though
a
grand
jury
may
indict
in
a
given
case,
the
california
supreme
court
has
held
that
a
defendant
is
entitled
also
to
a
preliminary
hearing.
in
all
instances
is
a
felony
prosecution
a
defendant
is
entitled
to
a
preliminary
hearing
in
california.
mr.
james
d.
ward
the
result
of
the
preliminary
hearing,
justice
marshall,
is
simply
to
hold
the
defendant
to
answer
or
not
hold
the
defendant
to
answer
to
the
superior
court
for
trial
of
the
action.
mr.
james
d.
ward
yes,
the--
mr.
james
d.
ward
--it
is
duplicative--
mr.
james
d.
ward
--that
is
true.
mr.
james
d.
ward
yes,
justice
powell.
mr.
james
d.
ward
yes,
and
frequently
they
are.
mr.
james
d.
ward
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
basis
of
the
furtherance
of
justice
may
be
made.
the
magistrate
has
that
power
as
well,
and
it
does
occur.
mr.
james
d.
ward
merely
that
in
the
trial
there
is
a
determination
by
the
jury,
if
a
jury
is
called
for,
for
the
determination
of
guilt
or
innocence.
mr.
james
d.
ward
the
burden
of
proof
is
the
same.
mr.
james
d.
ward
the
presentation
on
the
part
of
the
prosecution
is
literally
identical
in
the
proceedings.
it's
a
test
run,
as
it
were,
of
the
case.
mr.
james
d.
ward
no,
i
stand
corrected
on
that.
the
magistrate
does
not
have
to
find
probable
cause
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
but
so
far
as
the
evidence
that
may
be
presented
and
the
test
of
the
evidence,
it
is
the
same
in
a
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
james
d.
ward
that's
quite
true,
justice
white.
mr.
james
d.
ward
oh,
that's
quite
true
as
well.
yes,
certainly,
it
is
often
simply
a
prima
facie
showing
on
the
part
of
the
prosecution,
but
equally
as
often,
i
think,
although
there's
no
empirical
data
to
establish
one
way
or
another,
the
prosecution
will
put
on
its
entire
case,
the
reason
being
that
in
90
percent...
the
exact
figure
varies
from
year
to
year...
of
cases
there
is
no
trial
of
the
action
and
the
evidence
that
is
presented
at
the
preliminary
hearing
is
the
case
that
is
brought
before
the
court
for
all
purposes
at
that
point.
mr.
james
d.
ward
yes,
justice
o'connor,
that's
precisely
the
point.
mr.
james
d.
ward
i'm
sorry--
mr.
james
d.
ward
--i'm
sorry,
justice
o'connor.
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
i'm
not
certain
whether
there
are
others.
mr.
james
d.
ward
no,
we
do
not
argue
that
at
this
point.
mr.
james
d.
ward
i
think
we
had
this
exchange
once
before,
justice
o'connor.
no,
indeed,
there
is
no...
our
position
is
very
simply
that
we're
dealing
here
with
judicial
proceedings.
we
are
concerned
here,
of
course,
with
a
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
james
d.
ward
well,
i
suppose
that
is
true
in
certain
instances
but
so
far
as
the
scope
of
what
we
claim,
justice
o'connor,
our
position
is
that
we're
dealing
with
adjudicatory
proceedings
where
we
have
adversaries
or
we
have
parties
that
are
presenting
differing
views
and
a
neutral
magistrate
is
making
decisions
upon
those
views.
we
believe
that
the
net
that
would
be
cast
out
on
a
rule
based
upon
our
case
which
is
a
preliminary
hearing
case
should
incorporate
adjudicatory
proceedings
where
opposing
counsel
are
present.
that,
granted,
would
take
in
most
if
not
all
of
pretrial
proceedings.
but
the
reason
why
we
so
fervently
believe
that
that
is
the
case
is
because
the
logic
that
this
court
has
applied
first
to
the
trial
in
richmond
newspapers
and
later
to
the
jury
voir
dire
in
the
first
press
enterprise
case,
we
thought
press
enterprise
won,
the
logic
that
was
applied
in
both
of
those
cases
is
overwhelmingly
similar
in
the
application
to
our
preliminary
hearing
and
we
believe
to
pretrial
proceedings
in
general,
because
the
values
of
openness
that
this
court
has
found
apply
in
those
instances
as
well,
and
to
some
degree
the
argument
can
be
advanced
even
to
a
greater
degree
in
those
instances.
mr.
james
d.
ward
yes,
to
cause
the
defendant
to
be
brought
before
the
superior
court,
except
that
the
preliminary
hearing
is
paramount
in
that
it
is
required
for
all
defendants,
justice
marshall,
yes.
mr.
james
d.
ward
if
the
grand
jury--
mr.
james
d.
ward
--i
understand,
but--
mr.
james
d.
ward
--i
understand
the
question,
justice
marshall,
and
i
feel
uncomfortable
arguing
foreclosure
of
any
proceeding,
but
arguments
could
be
advanced
that
the
grand
jury
proceeding
is
an
investigatory
process.
we
do
not
seek
access
to
the
police
investigatory
process.
mr.
james
d.
ward
yes,
we
suggest
that
that
is
a
logical
line
to
be
drawn,
dealing
only
here
with
adjudicatory
proceedings
where
the
parties...
where
opposing
parties
are
present
to
litigate
the
matter
before
a
neutral
magistrate.
mr.
james
d.
ward
yes,
we
believe
so,
justice
burger.
we
think
that
our
right
is
obviously
a
qualified
right
to
access,
as
this
court
has
found,
as
it
has
found
it
in
all
other
instances,
and
that
qualified
right
requires
definition,
and
frankly
we
seek
nothing
new
in
connection
with
the
definition
of
the
standard
that
we
propose
in
connection
with
the
preliminary
and
with
pretrial
proceedings.
we
suggest
that
the
standards
that
have
been
set
by
this
court
in
the
cases
that
you
have
determined
on
access
are
adequate
to
define
the
standard
for
the
pretrial
proceedings
as
well.
mr.
james
d.
ward
yes,
a
hearing
would
be
part
of
it,
justice
brennan,
yes.
we
feel
that
hearing
and
notice
to
the
parties
is
imperative.
it
is
our
position
that
the
parties
seeking
closure
must
establish
the
necessity
for
closure.
we
feel
that
closure
must...
any
closure
would
have
to
be
narrowly
tailored
to
meet
a
specific
governmental
or
societal
interest.
we
feel
that
before
any
closure,
that
all
less
restrictive
alternatives
must
be
looked
to
for
the
purpose
of
seeing
if
they
could
solve
the
perceived
problem,
and
finally--
mr.
james
d.
ward
--the
use
of
change
of
venue,
justice
rehnquist,
has
always
been
one
of
the
alternatives
available
to
the
court
to
avoid
closure,
and
an
alternative
available
to
the
court
to
provide
a
fair
trial
to
the
defendant,
and
our
answer
is
yes,
that
that
would
have
to
be
considered
by
the
court
as
one
of
the
alternatives
that
would
be
available
before
closure
could
be
pronounced.
mr.
james
d.
ward
we're
dealing,
of
course--
mr.
james
d.
ward
--in
the
end
if
the
only
alternative
to
provide
a
fair
trial
is
a
motion
for
change
of
venue,
and
that
contrasts
with
the
right
of
access,
our
answer
is
yes,
that
the
values
attaching
to
access
and
open
proceedings
predominate
and
they
must
of
necessity...
the
proceedings
must
be
open
regardless
of
the
possibility
that
a
change
of
venue
must
be
one
of
the
alternatives
that
can--
mr.
james
d.
ward
--respectfully,
justice
blackmun,
i
do
not
think
we
are
swimming
upstream.
i
think
we
are
in
the
mainstream
of
this
court's--
mr.
james
d.
ward
--well,
i
think
the
use
of
the
title
has
presented
a
problem
to
us,
and
in
some
of
your
analysis
in
gannett
as
well,
looking
to
the
history
of
the
proceeding,
i
think
it's
important
to
consider
what
we're
dealing
with
here
by
way
of
a
preliminary
hearing.
first,
i
would
not
want
to
say
that
the
california
preliminary
is
so
unique
that
a
rule
that
could
come
from
this
case
should
not
be
applied
to
other
parts
of
the
country.
preliminary
hearings
in
other
parts
of
the
country
are
equally
important,
in
our
view.
but
secondly,
we
must
look
to
the
history
of
the
proceedings
for
some
guidance
in
this
regard.
it
isn't
the
final,
infallible
rule,
but
it
is
certainly
a
guide
to
it.
the
history
which
is
set
out
in
our
amicus
brief,
which
i
hope
the
court
will
be
able
to
read,
is
a
history
which
establishes
that
when
the
preliminary
hearing,
quote
unquote,
as
it
was
referred
to
in
ancient
england,
or
we're
referring
to
that
proceeding
from
ancient
england,
transferred
itself
from
an
inquisitorial,
investigatory
process
where
the
magistrate
admittedly
did
it
in
secret,
when
that
proceeding
switched
from
that
to
a
proceeding
whereby
it
was
a
neutral
fact
finder
with
opposing
counsel
involved
in
the
proceeding,
it
became
an
open
process
and
logically
so.
mr.
james
d.
ward
well,
i
think--
mr.
james
d.
ward
--thank
you,
justice
blackmun,
but
i
think
one
of
the
things
that
has
come
out
of
late
is,
in
our
investigation,
was
for
instance
the
aaron
bird
trial
was
one
of
the
more
fascinating
matters
of
investigation.
that
celebrated
trial
had
involved
in
it
two
preliminary
hearings,
during
the
course
of
which
the
crowd
that
attended
the
preliminary
hearing
was
so
great
that
they
had
to
adjourn
from
the
courtroom
and
move
to
another
chamber
in
order
to
accommodate
it,
and
justice
marshall
in
handling
that
matter
had
to
fashion
a
specific
voir
dire
in
order
to
in
his
mind
overcome
the
elements
of
pretrial
publicity
that
he
believed
existed.
mr.
james
d.
ward
i
think
that
the
circuit
courts
and
some
of
the
reasoning...
well,
i
will
not
refer
to
this
court
but
some
of
the
circuit
courts
have
found
that
the
suppression
hearing
is
not
a
candidate
for
closure.
indeed,
it
is
so
similar
to
the
trial
itself
because
it
involves
the
presentation
of
trial
evidence,
that
in
fact
it
is
a
definite
candidate--
mr.
james
d.
ward
--we
suggest,
justice
burger,
that
the
problem
of
prejudicial
pretrial
publicity
is
not
real.
we
suggest,
as
this
court
has
held,
that
it
is
a
manageable
problem.
we
feel
that
the--
mr.
james
d.
ward
--we
feel
it
should
not
be,
simply
on
the
discretion
of
the
court
to
close
on
that
ground.
that's
correct.
our
position
regarding
pretrial
publicity
is
simply
that
it
is
a
very
manageable
problem.
there
are
a
number
of
alternatives
that
are
available.
this
court
has
weighed
the
problem
in
different
contexts
and
has
found,
in
fact,
that
prejudicial
pretrial
publicity
is
a
rare
instance.
the
statistical
data
available
indicates
that
a
miniscule
number
of
cases
were
ever
reversed
on
the
basis
of
prejudicial
pretrial
publicity.
mr.
james
d.
ward
justice
stevens,
our
specific
appeal
is
from
the
closure
of
the
transcript.
mr.
james
d.
ward
and
that
brings
us
to
this
court
today.
but
the
reasoning
is
that
we
are
of
necessity
engaging
in,
or
the
exchange
that
we
are
engaging
in,
involves
the
same
process
in
connection
with
the
closure
of
the
preliminary
hearing
itself.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
there's
no
real
difference
in
consideration
of
the
arguments
on
the
case.
we
have
the
right
party
in
that
it
was
a
superior
court
judge
who
refused
to
grant
us
access
to
the
transcript.
our
first
application
for
relief
followed
the
completion
of
the
preliminary,
and
all
that
there
remained
was
the
transcript.
mr.
james
d.
ward
yes,
i
believe
so,
or
actually
saying
it
another
way,
that
the
right
of
access
to
the
transcript
of
necessity
litigates
the
issue
of
right
of
access
to
the
preliminary
hearing
because
without
access
to
the
preliminary
hearing
there
would
not
of
necessity
be
any
right
of
access
to
the
transcript.
mr.
james
d.
ward
yes,
thank
you,
justice
stevens.
that's
precisely
the
point
i
made
earlier,
that
i'm
happy
you
see
that
point.
i
agree
with
that
point,
yes.
mr.
james
d.
ward
well,
the
rule--
mr.
james
d.
ward
--no,
it
does
not,
justice
marshall,
for
this
reason:
that
the
rule
that
we
seek
is
a
rule
regarding
access
to
judicial
proceedings
or
adjudicatory
proceedings
involving
a
neutral
magistrate
or
judge.
our
position
is
that
the
values
of
openness
attach
to
those
types
of
proceedings.
now,
as
justice
o'connor
observed,
possibly
another
day
will
come
when
the
argument
will
arrive
regarding
the
grand
jury
proceedings,
but
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
judicial
proceeding,
an
adjudicatory
proceeding,
and
a
rule
derived
from
this,
we
do
not
believe
would
encompass
necessarily--
mr.
james
d.
ward
--i
would
say...
the
phraseology
i
would
prefer
to
use
is
that
it
doesn't
fall
within
the
ambit
of
the
rule
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
james
d.
ward
that's
quite
true,
justice
marshall,
and
another
thing
regarding
openness
of
pretrial
suppression
hearings
is
consideration
of
the
fact
that
you're
dealing
there
with
the
potential
for
government
wrongdoing,
and
the
observation
of
that
process
is
most
important
to
the
public
and
it
is
essential--
mr.
james
d.
ward
--yes,
i
believe
so,
justice
burger,
because
i
think
this
court
has
held
that
the
transcript
is
only
a
second
best
alternative.
mr.
james
d.
ward
the
first
is
to
be
there,
and
the--
mr.
james
d.
ward
--except,
justice
burger,
to
this
degree,
that
timeliness
is
lost,
and
in
so
many
of
these
instances
we're
dealing
with
the
problem
of
timeliness
of
the
proceedings,
as
in
the
instant
case
as
cited...
as
indicated
in
our
briefs,
we
were
involved
in
an
allegation
by
one
counsel
regarding
the
alleged
misconduct
or
statements
that
should
not
have
been
made
by
a
trial
judge.
changes
in
the
life
of
that
judge
took
place.
he
was
elevated
to
another
bench
in
the
interim,
and
during
a
time
when
the
proceedings
were
sealed.
the
public
lost
access
to
the--
mr.
james
d.
ward
--i'm
sorry,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
james
d.
ward
i
think
not,
jutice
rehnquist.
that
isn't
precisely
the
point.
but
i
think
that
you
do
raise
an
important
point,
that
there...
at
least
your
question
raises
a
point
that
i
think
should
be
made,
that
the
process
of
criminal
justice
in
this
country
is
replete
with
publicity.
it
begins
from
the
moment
of
arrest
until
the
final
disposition
of
the
case.
all
that
this
court
and
this
rule
would
concern
itself
with
would
be
the
preliminary
hearing
which
is
but
a
small
part
of
it.
mr.
james
d.
ward
justice
white,
consider
for
a
moment
in
the
context--
mr.
james
d.
ward
--only
if
it
were
an
adjudicatory
process.
mr.
james
d.
ward
that
is,
if
the
judge
were
hearing
the
matter
before
opposing
counsel.
mr.
james
d.
ward
yes,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
do.
mr.
james
d.
ward
well,
just
for
clarification,
we
make
no
claim
of
access
to
the
plea
bargaining
process
from
the--
mr.
james
d.
ward
--well,
but
of
course,
we
look
to
the
logic
of
what
we're
dealing
with
here.
we're
dealing
with
values
of
openness
that
this
court--
mr.
james
d.
ward
--well,
the
question
was,
justice
white,
whether
there
ever
would
be
instances
when
the
matter
of
plea
bargaining
would
be
cases
where
we
would
seek
openness,
and
my
response
was,
when
it
was
an
adjudicatory
process.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
people
of
the
state
of
california
through
an
initiative
process
limited
plea
bargaining
in
california.
they
specified
in
certain
crimes
that
there
were
limits.
they're
interested
in
that
process.
consider
further,
in
answer
to
your
question,
the
mcmartin
pretrial
case
which
went
on
with
a
preliminary
hearing
of
some
14
months
after
which
five
of
the
defendants
were
dismissed.
it
was
fortunately
an
open
process,
because
if
it
had
not
been,
consider
the
potential
outrage
of
the
community
at
having
had
a
secret
process
going
on
for
that
length
of
time.
mr.
james
d.
ward
we
seek
constitutional
right
of
access,
definitely;
beyond
that,
the
statutory
right
that
is
currently
given
to
us.
mr.
james
d.
ward
the
mcmartin
preschool
case.
mr.
james
d.
ward
yes,
justice
burger,
14
months.
and
during
that
time
a
number
of
laws
were
enacted
regarding
child
abuse.
it
was
a
celebrated
child
abuse
case
arising
out
of
los
angeles.
five
of
the
defendants
were
dismissed
after
the
completion
of
that
proceeding.
we
submit
there
is
a
need
for
the
community
catharsis,
which
has
been
said
by
the
court
before.
if
i
could
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
james
d.
ward
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
respondent
refers
to
the
right,
and
indicate
that
there
is
a
statutory
right
but
that
it
does
not
elevate
itself
to
the
level
of
a
constitutional
right.
i
need
not
remind
this
court,
i
think,
of
the
values
that
this
court
has
attached
to
openness
of
a
judicial
proceeding,
and
those
values
certainly,
in
our
opinion,
must
apply
to
the
critical,
the
pivotal,
the
most
important
preliminary
hearing
in
california,
and
that's--
mr.
james
d.
ward
--the
preliminary
hearing
is
paramount,
justice
brennan.
mr.
james
d.
ward
if
the
defendant
is
not
held
to
answer,
that's
the
disposition
of
the--
mr.
james
d.
ward
--that's
correct,
in
my
understanding.
the
point
of
the
matter
is,
in
our
opinion,
that
these
important
values
must
be
protected
in
some
way.
we
cannot
have
secret
hearings.
we
cannot
have
closed
proceedings.
and
a
california
preliminary
hearing
must
in
our
opinion
be
open.
we
just
extent
the
logic
of
that,
we
believe,
to
pretrial
proceedings
in
general.
our
position
is--
mr.
james
d.
ward
--the
last
time
that
we
appeared
in
press
enterprise
one,
where
the
court
was
considering
the
voir
dire
of
the
jury,
the
standard
that
was
promulgated
there
was
that
the
closure
has
to
be
narrowly
tailored
to
satisfy
an
overriding
governmental,
societal
interest
and
that
reasonable
alternatives
must
be
looked
to.
mr.
james
d.
ward
waller
used
the
reasoning,
i
believe
totally,
of
press
enterprise
one
in
its
decision.
mr.
james
d.
ward
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
language
or
the
standards
of
this
court
as
they
have
been
promulgated.
what
we
quarrel
with--
mr.
james
d.
ward
--the
waller
standard,
yes,
because
the
waller
standard
as
we
recall
it
referred
specifically
to
the
press
enterprise
one
standard.
what
we
quarrel
with
is
the
california
supreme
court
standard
which
did
not
call
for
reasonable
alternatives,
which
did
not
call
that
it
be
narrowly
tailored,
which
did
not
call
that
there
be
an
overriding
interest,
which
did
not
require
articulated
findings.
the
california
standard
has
none
of
the
constitutional
underpinnings
that
this
court
has
found
essential
in
connection
with
evaluating
openness.
the
standards
set
by
the
california
supreme
court
is,
simply
put,
constitutionally
deficient.
it
doesn't
have
within
it
all
of
the
safeguards
which
this
court
has
heretofore
provided.
it
is
our
opinion
that
the
california
supreme
court
in
the
standard
that
it
has
set
has
violated
our
constitutional
rights
and
must
be
reversed.
three
times
this
court
has
called
for
openness
of
various
judicial
proceedings,
at
least
three
times.
twice
the
california
supreme
court
since
1982
has
not
heeded
that
admonition
at
all
but
has
instead
found
for
closure
of
proceedings
and
provided
an
easy
standard
for
closure
which
we
believe
will
result
in
a
denial
of
the
rights
of
the
citizens
of
the
state
of
california
to
access
to
the
proceedings,
which
they
need
to
achieve
the
values
which
this
court
has
thus
far
recognized.
