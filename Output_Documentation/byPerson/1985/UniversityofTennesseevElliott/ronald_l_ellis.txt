mr.
ronald
l.
ellis
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
brogan
and
the
university
of
tennessee
constantly
refer
to
the
traditional
principles
of
preclusion
and
the
full
faith
and
credit
that
is
due
judgments
of
administrative
agencies.
in
so
doing,
they
fail
to
make
the
critical
distinctions
that
are
necessary
in
determining
how
the
court
should
handle
the
agency
decision
in
this
case.
the
particular
decision
is
not
covered
by
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause,
because
it
is
not
a...
that
only
applies
to
decisions
from
state
to
state.
similarly,
section
1738
of
u.s.c.
28
does
not
apply
because,
as
justice
rehnquist
pointed
out,
this
is
not
the
decision
of
a
court.
since
we
are
not
faced
with
the
tension
that
1738
necessarily
invokes
when
we
are
dealing
with
the
civil
rights
statutes,
again
justice
rehnquist
is
right
that
what
we
are
left
with
is
the
common
law
preclusion.
and
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
court
should
fashion
the
common
law
of
preclusion
for
the
agency
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
ronald
l.
ellis
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
there
are
a
number
of
ways
that
that
decision
can
be
looked
at.
first
of
all,
considering
the
fact
that
that
involved
a
decision
of
a
state
court
and
a
decision
involving
the
district
of
columbia,
it
is
possible
to
look
at
the
district
of
columbia
as
a
state
for
the
purposes
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause.
mr.
ronald
l.
ellis
that
in
fact
was
an
administrative
proceeding.
i
don't
think
that
that
case
announced
a
broad
principle,
first
of
all,
as
to
how
administrative
agency
decisions
should
be
handled
by
this
court,
and
certainly
not
in
the
context
of
someone
bringing
a
civil
rights
action.
mr.
ronald
l.
ellis
that's
right,
justice
o'connor.
and
i
think
that
the
distinction
we
would
make
is
that
an
agency
decision
when
you're
going
from
state
to
state
may
be
entitled
to
preclusion
if
that
agency
satisfies
certain
other
prerequisites
that
traditional
principles
of
preclusion
require;
that
in
the
case
where
you
are
not
going
from
state
to
state,
that
is
from
state
to
federal,
federal
to
state,
or
federal
to
federal,
that
what
you
must
look
at
is
either
the
federal
statute
in
the
case
of
state
to
federal
or
a
federal
common
law
if
it's
not
covered
by
the
statute
or
the
clause.
and
that
in
the
case
of
federal
common
law,
it's
up
to
the
court
to
determine
whether
it
is
appropriate
to
fashion
a
rule
of
preclusion
or
to
apply
a
federal
rule
of
preclusion
for
the
particular
type
of
decision
which
is
sought
to
be
precluded.
we
would
submit
that,
contrary
to
what
mr.
brogan
says,
that
we
should
not
forget
that
this
is
a
civil
rights
action,
and
that
in
determining
whether
we
should
fashion
a
rule
of
preclusion
we
should
look
to
congress'
intent
in
fashioning
the
civil
rights
act
in
terms
of
how
they
expected
a
federal
court
to
deal
with
an
agency
decision.
and
in
this
case,
certainly
with
respect
to
title
vii,
congress
has
spoken
not
once,
not
twice,
but
three
times
concerning
the
preclusive
effects
of
agency
decisions:
first
of
all,
in
1964
with
the
adoption
of
title
vii;
then
in
1972,
when
the
amendments
of
title
vii
were
made;
and
then
in
a
slightly
different
context,
in
the
adoption
of
the
civil
rights
reform
act
in
1978.
in
each
of
those
instances,
what
congress
did
was
indicate
what
its
view
was
concerning
the
preclusive
effect
of
state
agency
decisions
or,
more
precisely,
the
right
of
claimants
bringing
civil
rights
actions
to
a
de
novo
trial
in
federal
court.
as
this
court
recognized
in
alexander
versus
gardner-denver
and
chandler
versus
roudebush,
the
congress
enunciated
certain
principles
concerning
the
rights
of
employees
to
bring
cases
in
federal
court.
first
of
all,
the
court...
the
congress
indicated
that
all
employees,
whether
federal,
state,
or
private,
would
be
entitled
to
that
trial
de
novo,
regardless
of
what
prior
agency
decision
was
utilized
by
that
employee.
secondly,
the
court
has
found
and
congress
has
reiterated
that
individuals
bringing
civil
rights
actions
under
title
vii
would
be
entitled
to
pursue
independently
rights
under
title
vii
regardless
of
their
rights
under
other
applicable
state
and
federal
statutes.
the
court
has
gone
on
to
say
that,
for
the
purposes
of
title
vii,
the
federal
courts
have
the
primary
responsibility
for
the
enforcement
of
those
rights.
that's
the
language
that
the
court
recognized
in
kremer,
and
the
court
recognized
that
the
dividing
line
between
preclusion
and
non-preclusion
in
the
context
of
a
civil
rights
action
was
whether
a
claimant
crossed
the
line
between
agency
action
and
state
court
action.
mr.
ronald
l.
ellis
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
if
we're
in
the
area
of
federal
preclusion,
then
what
we
do
is
we
do
not
have
the
tension
of
1738
and
1983
that
was
important
in
allen
versus
mccurry,
that
if
we
do
not
have
that
tension
then
what
we
rely
on
is
the
expressed
intent
of
congress
in
the
formulation
of
1983
and
the
other
reconstruction
civil
rights
statutes;
that
if
1738
is
not
in
the
picture,
then
the
clear
intent
of
congress
was
that
those
rights
under
1983
were
to
be
enforced
in
federal
court;
and
that
in
fact
the
congress
that
enacted
1983
had
certain
suspicions
about
state
courts
and
state
agencies,
and
it
was
the
reason
why
they
decided
that
those
rights
would
be--
mr.
ronald
l.
ellis
--no,
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
take
that
position.
i'm
just
trying
to
enunciate
how
congress'
intent
was
enunciated
in
terms
of
what
they
felt
was
important
in
terms
of
1983.
and
their
intent
was
that,
to
the
extent
possible,
the
rights
that
were
guaranteed
under
1983
should
be
protected
by
federal
courts.
mr.
ronald
l.
ellis
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
one
thing
that
we
have
to
remember
is
that,
the
sequence
of
events
in
terms
of
this
agency
and
what
happened.
while
it
is
true
that
the
university
of
tennessee
is
empowered
to
act
as
an
agency,
in
fact
what
happened
was
the
university
proposed
mr.
elliott
termination,
and
if
he
did
not
respond
within
five
days
seeking
to
have
the
university
rule
on
whether
there
was
just
cause
to
terminate
him,
his
termination
would
have
been
final.
so
that
the
agency
decision
in
this
case
is
really
not
an
external
agency.
what
it
is
is
the
university
of
tennessee
taking
the
last
step
in
saying
that
mr.
elliott
is
going
to
be
disciplined.
mr.
ronald
l.
ellis
no,
justice
rehnquist.
what
happened
really
was
that
he
went
into
federal
court.
while
mr.
brogan
makes
a
point
of
the
fact
that
he
should
have
gone
into
federal
court,
in
fact
that's
what
mr.
elliott
did.
mr.
elliott--
mr.
ronald
l.
ellis
--given
the
five
days
in
which
he
had
to
make
the
decision,
mr.
elliott,
knowing
that
his
employment
was
about
to
be
terminated,
elected
to
contest
that
termination,
but
immediately
went
into
federal
court.
mr.
ronald
l.
ellis
there's
nothing
that
would
have
required
him
to
go
there.
as
a
practical
matter
he
had
to
go
there.
mr.
elliott
was
put
in
the
untenable
position
at
that
point
of
suffering
the
loss
of
his
employment
of
electing
to
contest
his
termination.
and
as
soon
as
he
had
filed,
as
soon
as
he
had
indicated
to
the
university
of
tennessee
that
he
was
going
to
contest,
he
went
immediately
to
federal
court.
and
not
only
did
he
go
immediately
to
federal
court,
but
what
he
attempted
to
do
was
to
stop
the
state,
the
university
of
tennessee,
from
proceeding
with
its
determination.
it's
not
that
mr.
elliott
had
such
in
abiding
faith
in
that
decision.
it's
just
that
the
practicalities
of
the
situation
were
that
if
he
did
not
do
that
he
might
find
himself
without
a
job.
mr.
ronald
l.
ellis
well,
as
a
practical
matter,
the
possibility
of
recovering
his
job
some
time
down
the
road
is
not
something
which
someone
in
that
position
would
consider
to
be
a
viable
alternative.
and
given
the
congestion
in
the
federal
courts...
and
in
fact,
what
happened
in
this
case,
there
were
a
number
of
delays
in
the
federal
court
before
the
agency
decision.
mr.
elliott
would
have
been
out
of
a
job
and,
while
he
had
he
right
to
reinstatement
and
back
pay,
the
practical
application
of
it
is
that
he
would
have
been
unemployed
and
lost
some
of
the
benefits
of
being
on
the
job.
mr.
ronald
l.
ellis
yes,
there
is.
mr.
ronald
l.
ellis
there
is
an
agency.
mr.
ronald
l.
ellis
he
filed...
he
did
not
file
with
that
agency.
he
filed--
mr.
ronald
l.
ellis
--he
has
filed--
mr.
ronald
l.
ellis
--after
he
filed
with
the
university
of
tennessee--
mr.
ronald
l.
ellis
--he
did
file
with--
mr.
ronald
l.
ellis
--that's
correct.
mr.
ronald
l.
ellis
subsequent
to
his
filing
with
the
university,
he
did
file
appropriately
for
title
vii
purposes
and
receive
a
right
to
sue
letter.
mr.
ronald
l.
ellis
so
he
has
now
received
that
right
to
sue
letter,
and
he
has
gone
through
the
appropriate
procedures
in
tennessee
and
the
eeoc.
mr.
ronald
l.
ellis
as
i
indicated,
congress
did
not
stop
with
the
civil
rights
act
in
terms
of
indicating
what
should
be
the
result
when
someone
files
a
subsequent
civil
rights
action
when
there
is
a
prior
agency
decision.
in
enacting
the
civil
service
reform
act
in
1978,
although
that's
a
different
statutory
scheme,
the
conference
report
and
the
senate
and
house
reports
indicate
quite
clearly
that
the
intent
of
congress
was
to
protect
the
rights
of
trial
de
novo
which
employees
under
title
vii.
that
statute
provides
for
at
least
nine
different
times
at
which
an
employee
may
bring
suit
in
federal
court.
included
in
that
right
to
bring
suit
in
federal
court
is
a
right
to
bring
suit
even
after
an
employee
has
sought
review
in
the
eeoc
and
before
the
merit
systems
protection
board.
congress
indicated
that
an
employee
would
still
have
the
right
to
bring
his
individual
employment
discrimination
case.
in
fact,
the
statute
specifically
distinguishes
between
individuals
who
claim
only
an
adverse
action
and
individuals
who
claim
an
adverse
action
pursuant
to
one
of
the
anti-discrimination
statutes.
and
while
individuals
who
only
claim
an
adverse
action
are
entitled
to
a
review
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
court
of
claims
pursuant
to
an
administrative
procedure
type
proceeding,
individuals
who
claim
their
adverse
action
also
violates
the
anti-discrimination
statutes
are
entitled
to
go
into
federal
district
court
for
a
trial
de
novo.
i
think
the
concerns
of
congress
in
taking
the
federal
courts
available
to
claimants
in
civil
rights
cases
is
borne
out
by
the
facts
of
this
case.
what
has
happened
is
that
the
university
of
tennessee
as
part
of
its
employment
decision
has
determined
that
mr.
elliott
should
be
disciplined
and
has
gone
into
federal
court
and
told
the
federal
court
that:
we
have
determined
what
should
happen
to
mr.
elliott,
and
the
federal
court
should
not
intervene.
the
decision
of
the
administrative
law
judge
is
no
more
than
the
decision
of
an
employee
of
the
university
of
tennessee,
a
recommendation
to
his
own
supervisor
as
to
how
the
university
should
deal
with
mr.
elliott.
as
such,
it
is
not,
as
the
university
claims,
somewhere
down
the
line
in
terms
of
the
agency
action,
the
state
action,
but
it
is
merely
the
beginning
of
the
process.
that
is,
only
after
the
agency
has
affirmed
the
initial
order
is
mr.
elliott's
employment
in
jeopardy.
that
point
was
raised
by
the
university
in
seeking
to
have
mr.
elliott's
case
originally
transferred
from
the
federal
court.
when
mr.
elliott
went
into
federal
court
and
sought
a
temporary
restraining
order,
the
university
of
tennessee
went
into
federal
court
and
said
that:
we
have
a
decision
that
we
can
make
in
terms
of
hearing.
mr.
elliott
is
not
fired.
we
haven't
had
our
final
decision
on
mr.
elliott,
and
whatever
action
we
take
on
mr.
elliott
will
not
be
final
until
we
have
given
him
this
administrative
hearing.
so
that
the
university
in
getting
the
case
out
of
federal
court
urged
the
federal
court
that
they
had
not
finished
with
mr.
elliott,
and
therefore
the
federal
court
should
abstain
from
taking
action
until
the
university
had
made
a
final
decision
on
mr.
elliott's
employment.
because
the
hearing
examiner
in
this
case
was
an
employee
of
the
university,
the
particular
decision
also
should
not
be
entitled
to
preclusive
effect
because
mr.
elliott
should
have
been
entitled
to
an
impartial
hearing
by
an
external
body.
mr.
ronald
l.
ellis
that
is
not
entirely
correct.
it
is
possible
for
someone
who
is
appealing
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
in
tennessee
to
raise
procedural
irregularities
in
the
hearing
and
to
introduce
evidence
de
novo
in
chancery
court.
mr.
ronald
l.
ellis
it
would
then
be
based
on
the
record.
mr.
ronald
l.
ellis
according
to
the
tennessee
administrative
procedure
act,
the
only
way
to
review
in
state
court
the
decision
of
an
agency
is
through
the
chancery
court.
it
is
possible
that
that
agency
decision
would
be
preclusive
in
the
tennessee
state
courts
if
it
covered
the
same
area
that
the
agency
decision
covered.
mr.
ronald
l.
ellis
and
there
was
a
fair
hearing.
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize
that,
despite
the
university's
protestations
to
the
contrary,
that
mr.
elliott
did
not
have
an
opportunity
to
raise
his
racial
discrimination
claims
fully
and
fairly.
he
did
attempt
on
many
occasions
throughout
the
hearing
to
present
evidence
which
would
have
been
relevant
to
claims
of
discrimination,
not
only
to
his
own
personal
claim
but
to
the
claims
that
he
had
raised
on
behalf
of
the
class
and
claims
which
he
had
raised
against
other
defendants
in
federal
court.
the
hearing
examiner
took
the
position,
first
of
all,
that
he
had
no
jurisdiction
to
handle
racial
discrimination
claims:
and,
even
if
he
did,
that
he
could
not
adjudicate
questions
that
did
not
concern
mr.
elliott
and
the
university.
any
other
person,
any
other
defendant,
was
not
germane
to
the
determination
of
the
administrative
law
judge,
and
therefore
he
excluded
evidence
which
mr.
elliott
tried
to
present
concerning
how
other
individuals
were
treated,
other
areas
of
discrimination
by
the
university
of
tennessee,
and
the
ability
of
mr.
elliott
to
function
in
the
university
of
tennessee
as
an
extension
agent.
as
we
indicate
in
our
brief,
there
are
a
number
of
deficiencies
in
this
particular
agency
decision,
not
the
least
of
which
is
that
this
agency
is
not
the
kind
of
agency
that
we
usually
think
of
as
an
external
body
ruling
on
questions
between
two
parties.
mr.
elliott
did
not
receive
an
impartial
hearing.
we
believe
that,
regardless
of
what
kind
of
rules
might
apply
to
agency
decisions,
such
rules
should
not
apply
to
the
type
of
agency
decisions
in
this
particular
cases;
that
despite
the
procedures
that
the
administrative
procedure
act
provides
in
terms
of
the
external
trappings,
that
in
fact
the
due
process
requirements
are
not
satisfied
because
mr.
elliott
had
not
had
an
opportunity
to
have
at
least
one
impartial
hearing
on
his
claim
of
discrimination.
we
believe
that
the
failure
to
provide
such
an
impartial
hearing
robs
this
particular
agency
decision
of
the
ability
to
preclude
mr.
elliott
from
proceeding
in
federal
court.
mr.
elliott's
counsel
asked
for,
early
in
the
proceedings,
that
the
university
provide
an
administrative
law
judge
who
was
entirely
unconnected
with
the
university
or
the
extension
service.
the
university
was
empowered
to
seek,
through
the
secretary
of
state,
to
have
someone
from
that
office
act
in
the
capacity
of
administrative
law
judge.
the
university
failed
to
do
that.
instead,
one
of
the
the
defendants
in
this
case,
mr.
armistead,
appointed
one
of
his
employees
to
act
as
fact
finding
and
to
recommend
a
decision
to
mr.
armistead.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
not
that
much
different
from
the
situation
in
arnett
versus
kennedy
in
terms
of
the
question
of
due
process.
as
justice
white
mentioned
in
that
case,
and
we
agree:
"no
man
should
be
a
judge
in
his
own
cause.
"
and
if
the
university
of
tennessee,
even
if
it
had
provided...
even
if
the
particular
decision
in
this
case
would
not
on
general
principles,
not
be
entitled
to
preclusion,
on
the
specific
facts
of
this
case
and
on
the
specific
content
of
this
hearing,
the
rules
of
preclusion
should
not
apply
and
mr.
elliott
should
have
been
allowed
to
bring
his
particular
employment
discrimination
case
in
federal
court.
we
think
that
the
sixth
circuit
was
right,
that
this
court's
decision
in
kremer
indicates
the
proper
dividing
line,
that
the
sixth
circuit's
rule
should
be
affirmed
and
that
agency
decisions,
regardless
of
their
extent,
regardless
of
how
the
state
wants
to
characterize
them
or
how
the
agency
wants
to
characterize
them,
should
not
be
entitled
to
preclusive
effect,
and
that
that
result
is
the
result
that
congress
wished
when
someone
brought
a
civil
rights
action.
thank
you.
