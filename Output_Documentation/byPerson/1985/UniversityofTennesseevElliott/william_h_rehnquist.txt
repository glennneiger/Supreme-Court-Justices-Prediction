justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
under
state
law
that
was
final?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
an
agency
for
that
purpose?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
may
i
interrupt
you
with
a
question
that's
been
running
through
my
mind.
supposing,
instead
of
going
into
federal
court,
you
decided
that
after
the
administrative
proceeding
was
over,
but
without
seeking...
first
of
all,
do
you
agree
that
the
review
in
the
state
court
would
have
been
on
the
record
of
the
administrative
proceeding
and
not
de
novo
review?
