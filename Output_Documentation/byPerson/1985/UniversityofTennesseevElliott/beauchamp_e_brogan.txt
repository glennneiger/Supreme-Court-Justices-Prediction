mr.
beauchamp
e.
brogan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
arises
under
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
of
the
constitution
and
its
implementing
statute,
28
u.s.
code
section
1738.
the
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
traditional
principles
of
full
faith
and
credit
apply
in
actions
under
the
reconstruction
statutes
and
title
vii
to
issues
fairly
and
fully
litigated
before
a
state
agency
acting
in
a
judicial
capacity.
petitioners
seek
issue
preclusion
in
this
action
on
the
basis
of
a
prior
state
adjudication
under
the
tennessee
uniform
administrative
procedure
act,
which
respondent
voluntarily
invoked
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
his
due
process
rights
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution.
this
prior
adjudication
was
not
rendered
by
a
title
vii
federal
agency
within
the
eeoc
title
vii
enforcement
scheme,
but
was
rendered
completely
outside
the
title
vii
enforcement
scheme.
petitioners
contend
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
traditional
principles
of
full
faith
and
credit
apply
to
state
agency
adjudications
as
well
as
state
court
adjudications,
unless
exempted
by
congress.
petitioners
further
contend
that
neither
the
reconstruction
statutes
nor
title
vii
repeals
the
full
faith
and
credit
doctrine
is
applied
to
state
agency
adjudications.
mr.
beauchamp
e.
brogan
under
1983
and
title
vii,
yes.
mr.
beauchamp
e.
brogan
the
reconstruction
statutes.
mr.
beauchamp
e.
brogan
yes,
sir,
issue
preclusion
only,
not
claim
preclusion,
with
respect
to
both
1983...
and
when
i
refer
to
1983,
i'll
include
all
of
the
reconstruction
statutes
which
respondent
sued
under,
1981
and
so
forth.
but
we
contend
that
issue
preclusion,
not
claim
preclusion,
applies
to
both
1983
and
title
vii
on
the
basis
of
this
prior
adjudication,
which
was
a
judicial
proceeding
under
the
state
law
of
the
state
of
tennessee.
it
was
under
the
tennessee
uniform
administrative
procedure
act
that
was
voluntarily
invoked
by
the
respondent.
it
was
not
a
part
of
the
title
vii
enforcement
scheme.
mr.
beauchamp
e.
brogan
no,
sir,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
that
you
could
plausibly
reach
a
different
conclusion
as
to
1983.
but
i
think
the
same
rule
applies.
i
don't
think--
mr.
beauchamp
e.
brogan
--well,
there
would
be
a
lot
left.
1983,
as
this
court
has
held,
the
procedures--
mr.
beauchamp
e.
brogan
--well,
yes,
because
under
1983,
as
this
court
has
held,
the
relief
and
the
remedies
and
the
procedure
for
effecting
that
relief
are
entirely
different.
you
don't
have
to
do
anything
to
file
a
lawsuit
under
1983
as
a
precondition
to
filing.
all
you
have
to
do
is
just
go
down
to
federal
court
and
sue
to
invoke
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
but
under
title
vii
you
have
to
file
a
claim
with
the
eeoc
and
then--
mr.
beauchamp
e.
brogan
--the
remedies
are
entirely
different.
under
title
vii
the
back
pay
is
limited,
the
damages
are
limited,
whereas
under
1983
you're
not
limited
as
to
back
pay,
compensatory,
punitive
damages,
and
so
forth.
the
period
of
time
of
the
statute
of
limitations
is
different
as
to
both
statutory
schemes.
so
we
think
that
there
is
a
difference.
but
we
think
that
under
our
theory
of
the
case
that
there's
really
no
different
reasons
why
you
should
apply
one
rule
as
to
one
scheme
and
one
as
to
another.
we
think
that
under
the
holdings
of
this
court
that
there
is
no
express
or
implied
repeal
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
doctrine
clearly
to
1983,
and
neither
do
we
think
there
is
as
to
title
vii.
now,
this
action
arose
when
the
university
simply
proposed
to
terminate
plaintiff's
employment
for
inadequate
work
performance
and
improper
job
behavior.
and
under
the
tennessee
administrative
procedure
act,
which
is
the
model
uniform
act
adopted
by
31
jurisdictions,
the
university
was
required
to
afford
the
respondent
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing,
and
he
elected
to
take
a
hearing
under
the
uniform
administrative
procedure
act.
now,
that
act
has
procedural
safeguards
fully
equivalent
to
the
rules
of
civil
procedure,
and
you
have
the
same
type
of
trial,
the
same
type
of
hearing,
that
you
would
have
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
beauchamp
e.
brogan
yes,
that's
true,
your
honor.
he
does
claim
that
he
was
unsuccessful
in
introducing
certain
evidence.
but
those
go
to
his
title
vii
claims.
now,
the
petitioners
do
not
take
issue
with
the
fact
that
he
still
would
have
a
right
to
try
his
claims
to
the
extent
that
they
are
now
swallowed
up
by
his
issues
that
were
adjudicated.
now,
it
is
true--
mr.
beauchamp
e.
brogan
--well,
i
don't
think
he
would
be,
justice
o'connor.
if
he
was
not
allowed
to
litigate
an
issue,
then
under
our
doctrine
he
would
not
be
precluded.
he
would
only
be
precluded
from
relitigating
the
issues
that
were
actually
litigated
and
decided
by
the
administrative
law
judge.
mr.
beauchamp
e.
brogan
no,
your
honor,
that
is
not
what
happened.
it
is
true
that
certain
evidence
was
not
admitted,
but
the
evidence
is
abundantly
clear,
and
both
lower
courts
found,
that
he
was
clearly
permitted
to
introduce
evidence
of
racial
discrimination
as
an
affirmative
defense
to
the
proposed
charges.
and
he
insisted
on
making
that
election
as
how
he
would
defend.
he
chose
to
defend,
and
he
introduced
voluminous
testimony,
and
according
to
the
district
court
and
also
the
court
of
appeals,
virtually
every
allegation
of
individual
discrimination
that
he
alleged
in
his
federal
complaint
was
litigated
in
the
administrative
agency
hearing,
the
individual
instances.
now,
it's
true
that
his
claims,
his
class
action
claims,
were
not
litigated
and
evidence
of
that
was
not
admitted.
rut
under
the
ruling
by
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
it
would
be
wholly
immaterial
as
to
what
he
was
allowed
to
litigate,
because
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
did
not
examine
the
record
below.
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
clearly
said
that
he
was
permitted
to
assert
as
an
affirmative
defense
the
issue
of
racial
discrimination.
but
the
sixth
circuit
ruled
that,
without
regard
to
any
evidence
that
he
may
or
may
not
have
presented,
absent
state
court
review,
no
agency's
constitution
is
ever,
and
i
mean
ever,
entitled
to
preclusive
effect
in
a
subsequent
civil
rights
action.
so
that
under
our
theory
of
the
case,
your
honor,
if
ha
had
been
permitted
to
litigate
everything
that
he
wanted
to
put
into
evidence
and
then
the
ruling
had
been
against
him,
the
sixth
circuit
would
have
said:
you
have
a
right
to
start
all
over
again:
you're
not
bound
by
the
finding
of
that
law
judge.
mr.
beauchamp
e.
brogan
yes,
we
are,
your
honor.
it
is
plainly
a
judicial
proceeding,
because
under
the
nation's
statutory
scheme
a
state
can
enable
and
enact
legislation
to
permit
the
executive
branch
as
well
as
the
administrative
branch
of
state
government
to
exercise
judicial
powers.
now,
the
state
of
tennessee
and
31
other
jurisdictions
have
done
this
in
the
form
of
adopting
this
uniform
administrative
procedure
act.
and
under
that
act,
there
isn't
any
question
but
what
this
is
a
judicial
proceeding
within
the
meaning
of
both
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
and
section
1738.
it
is
a
judicial
proceeding.
the
decisions
of
this
court
we
don't
think
have
ever
made
any
distinction
between
state
agency
adjudications
and
state
court
adjudications
where
the
state
agency--
mr.
beauchamp
e.
brogan
--it
has
to
be
in
state
court.
mr.
beauchamp
e.
brogan
no,
sir.
mr.
beauchamp
e.
brogan
it's
on
the
record,
but...
but--
mr.
beauchamp
e.
brogan
--that's
correct.
according
to
the
law,
the
state
law
says
that
the
only
method
of
judicial
review
of
this
federal
decision
is
to
file
a
petition
in
a
state
chancery
court
within
60
days
from
the
date
of
the
final
order.
and
the
state
statute
sets
forth
the
scope
of
judicial
review,
which
is
very
similar
to
the
federal
administrative
procedure
act.
it
can
be
set
aside
if
it's
contrary
to
law,
if
it's
contrary
to
the
facts,
or
if
it's
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
now,
that's
what
he
contended
when
he
went
back
to
the
district
court.
if
you
look
at
what
he
did,
the
60
days
came
and
went.
he
had
60
days
after
this
final
agency
order
was
entered
to
file
a
petition
for
judicial
review.
he
did
not
do
that.
the
petitioner
did
not
do
that.
mr.
beauchamp
e.
brogan
yes,
your
honor.
it
could
not
be
collaterally
attacked
in
tennessee.
it
had
the
same
effect
as
a
state
court
judgment.
it
was
final
and
binding
on
the
parties,
both
parties.
now,
after
the
decision
is
made,
the
judge
found
that
the
evidence
was
not
sufficient
to
warrant
petitioner's...
i
mean,
the
respondent's
termination.
he
said,
considering
everything
in
its
proper
context,
i'm
going
to
find
that
you're
guilt
for
the
eight
charges,
but
i
don't
think
it's
sufficient
to
warrant
your
termination.
but
i
think
you
ought
to
be
transferred
to
another
county
under
new
supervisors.
all
right,
he
was
transferred
to
another
county.
60
days,
your
honor,
after
he
was
transferred,
and
84
days
after
this
agency
decision
was
final,
he
returned
to
federal
court.
now,
when
he
returned
to
federal
court,
he
did
not
go
to
federal
court
and
say:
your
honor,
i
have
a
right
to
sue
letter
under
eeoc,
here
it
is;
i
want
a
trial
de
novo.
what
he
did
was
he
filed
a
motion
which
in
effect
sought
to
have
the
district
court
review
according
to
the
standards
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
the
judgment
of
the
agency.
and
that's
set
forth
on
page
24
of
the
joint
appendix.
this
is
what
he
said.
he
says,
the
decision
of
the
judge
and
the
agency
constituted
an
abuse
of
discretion,
is
contrary
to
law,
and
is
not
supported
by
reliable,
probative,
and
substantial
evidence.
then
over
in
paragraph
number
8,
he
said:
the
administrative
law
judge's
and
agency's
decision
and
remedy...
the
remedy,
that's
ordering
his
transfer...
was
equally
unconstitutional
and
unlawful
in
wrongfully
rejecting
said
claims
of
racial
discrimination
despite
clear
evidence
thereof.
now,
if
it
please
the
court,
he
made
no
argument
before
the
district
court
that
the
evidence...
that
he
didn't
have
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
litigate.
he
said
the
evidence
in
overwhelming
that
the
decision
is
wrong.
now,
the
district
court
said:
well,
i,
number
one,
don't
have
authority
to
review
it
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
because
that
places
the
statutory
authority
to
review
it
in
the
state
court,
subject
to
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
on
up
to
the
tennessee
supreme
court
if
necessary.
now,
then
he
said...
and
he
applied
the
full
faith
and
credit
doctrine,
although
he
did
not
use
those
words.
judge
macray
said:
since
you
did
not
appeal
that
agency
decision
within
the
time
permitted
by
law,
it
is
now
final;
those
findings
are
binding
on
you,
they're
binding
on
the
university
of
tennessee;
you
cannot
go
behind
that
agency
decision:
and
i
cannot
undo
what
is
done,
i
cannot
order
you
back
to
the
place
from
where
you
was
transferred.
it's
already
been
accomplished,
anyway.
so
judge
macray
said
that
under
principles
of
res
judicata
and
collateral
estoppel
that
action
could
not
be
attacked
in
this
court
or
any
other
court,
and
we
think
he's
entirely
right,
your
honor.
mr.
beauchamp
e.
brogan
yes,
sir.
yes,
your
honor,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
relying
principally
on
the
kremer
case.
mr.
beauchamp
e.
brogan
well,
we
think
it
is,
your
honor,
for
this
reason.
this
court
in
thomas
versus
washington
gas
&
light
company,
every
member
of
this
court
in
thomas,
felt
that
issue
preclusion
should
apply
to
an
agency
adjudication,
and
the
plurality
said
that
state
agency
adjudications
were
just
as
entitled
to
full
faith
and
credit
as
a
state
court
judgment.
and
every
member
of
this
court
agreed.
the
only
disagreement
was
with
whether
claim
preclusion
should
apply
in
that
case.
but
not
one
member
of
this
court
dissented
with
the
proposition
that
issue
preclusion
should
apply
to
an
agency
adjudication.
now,
in
some
of
the
recent
cases
that
have
been
decided
under
these
statutes,
the
migra
case,
the
parsons
case,
which
is
the
most
recent
case,
this
court
stated
this,
and
i
just
wanted
to
quote
it
because
i
think
it's
important.
it
says:
"the
full
faith
and
credit
act,
28
u.s.
code
section
1738,
requires
federal
courts
as
well
as
state
courts
to
give
state
judicial
proceedings
the
same
full
faith
and
credit.
"
and
the
same
thing
with
the
marese
case.
mr.
beauchamp
e.
brogan
well,
i
think
you'd
have
to
look
at
the
state
law,
your
honor,
to
determine
what
is
a
judicial
proceeding.
and
if
a
judicial
proceeding
under
the
uniform
administrative
procedure
act,
which
is
specifically
enacted
by
the
state
legislature
for
the
purpose
of
enabling
people
to
protect
their
constitutional
and
statutory
rights,
where
they
have
the
same
plenary
type
right
to
a
hearing
as
you
would
have
in
a
federal
court...
i
don't
know
what
a
judicial
proceeding
is.
it's
similar,
it's
very
similar
to
the
federal
administrative
procedure
act,
and
this
court
has
always
ruled,
since
at
least
utah,
that
decisions
under
the
federal
administrative
procedure
act,
even
though
they're
unappealed,
are
entitled
to
full
faith
and
credit,
even
though
that's
not
under
this
statute.
mr.
beauchamp
e.
brogan
well,
it
would
have
to
be
on
the
doctrine
of
common
law
and
traditional
principles,
because
the
full
faith
and
credit
statute,
of
course,
does
not
apply
to
the
federal
government.
but
the
principle
is
the
same,
and
we
can't
find
any
difference
between
applying
one
standard
to
state
agency
adjudications
and
another
one
to
federal
adjudications.
and
we
think
that
in
this
case
the
reason
is
even
more
pronounced
than
in
a
federal
adjudication
because
if
the
full
faith
and
credit
doctrine
applies
then
it's
mandatory
that
the
principle
be
applied,
whereas
under
the
federal
agency
adjudications
it's
not
mandated
and
this
court
has
some
leeway
and
discretion,
i
suppose,
as
to
whether
to
apply
traditional
rules
of
preclusion.
so
our
position
is
that
if
you
look
at
the
meaning
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
and
it's
implementing
statute...
and
after
all,
all
the
statute
does
is
just
implement
the
clause,
and
the
clause
very
specifically
says
that
it's
a
judicial
proceeding...
i
mean,
if
it's
a
judicial
proceeding.
now,
of
course,
if
it's
not
a
judicial
proceeding
within
the
meaning
of
that
statute
and
the
clause,
then
i
would
have
to
confess,
your
honor,
that
it's
not
entitled
to
full
faith
and
credit.
but
if
it
is--
mr.
beauchamp
e.
brogan
--that's
what
the
statute
says,
but
the
clause
does
not
say
that,
and
we
don't
think
that
this
court
has
ever
given
such
a
cramped
interpretation.
mr.
beauchamp
e.
brogan
i
understand
that,
your
honor,
the
statute
would.
but
it
implements
the
clause,
and
we
think
that
under
the
national
statutory
scheme
that
the
clause
and
the
statute
have
to
be
read
together.
and
we
think
this
court
has
always
read
them
together.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
reading
these
cases
under
the
full
faith
and
credit
doctrine,
the
court
hardly
ever
refers
to
the
second
part
of
the
statute,
that
says
how
you
prove
the
judicial
records
of
a
state
court,
and
that's
all
that
section
does.
it
just
says
how
you
prove
these
judicial
records.
but
they
look
to
the
second
part
of
the
statute,
which
says...
which
is
the
important
part,
and
that
is
the
part,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
says
you
must
give
them
the
same
full
faith
and
credit
that
they
enjoy
in
the
state
of
rendition.
now,
we
think
that
if
you
did
not
give
this
judicial
proceeding
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
full
faith
and
credit,
it
would
in
effect
nullify
and
render
futile
the
administrative
procedure
act
in
all
these
various
states.
and
these
administrative
procedure
acts
do
more
than
just
define
the
rights
of
the
employer
and
employees.
they
deal
with
ratemaking,
the
suspension
and
revocation
of
licenses.
just
sort
of
like
the
federal
government's
statutory
scheme
under
the
apa,
where
you
have
the
federal
power
commission,
the
icc,
the
state
agency
has
all
sorts
of
regulatory
boards
and
agencies
that
come
under
this
administrative
procedure
act.
and
the
state
of
tennessee
has
administrative
law
judges,
just
like
the
federal
government
does,
that
adjudicate
these
rights.
so
that
if
you
forget
for
a
moment
that
this
is
a
civil
rights
case
and
say
in
an
ordinary
situation
would
this
adjudication
be
entitled
to
full
faith
and
credit
if
it's
not
appealed
and
it
becomes
final
and
binding
on
the
parties,
we
say
it
would.
so
then
the
only
question
is
whether
the
reconstruction
statutes
or
title
vii
expressly
or
impliedly
repealed
the
full
faith
and
credit
doctrine,
and
we
say
it
doesn't
because
of
the
holding
of
this
court
in
allen
and
migra
with
respect
to
the
1983.
and
with
respect
to
kremer,
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
just
swallowed
footnote
7
hook,
line,
and
sinker,
and
said
that,
based
on
footnote
7
of
kremer,
we
will
never
ever
give
preclusive
effect
to
a
state
adjudication
without
state
court
review.
i
want
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
did
not
recognize
the
critical
distinction
between
an
eeo,
the
federal
agency,
and
an
agency
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
like
we
have
in
this
case.
under
the
agency
that
was
involved
in
kremer,
the
court's
entire
opinion
deals
with
an
anti-discrimination
agency
where
a
litigant
or
a
claimant
is
required,
is
mandated
by
the
federal
law,
that
he
go
to
the
federal
agency
route.
and
the
eeoc
does
not
have
any
investigative
of
adjudicative
powers,
and
they
only
have
to
give
substantial
weight
to
the
decision
of
eeoc.
well,
the
eeoc
has
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
administrative
procedure
act
proceeding.
it's
entirely
outside
the
scope
of
title
vii.
so
that
we
think
that
is
the
critical
distinction.
nothing
required
the
respondent
to
litigate
his
claims
of
racial
discrimination
before
the
administrative
procedures
act...
the
administrative
law
judge.
nothing
even
demanded
that
he
go
there
in
the
first
place.
he
could
go
directly
to
the
federal
court
under
the
reconstruction
statutes
immediately,
and
he
could
have
prosecuted
his
right
to
sue
letter,
his
eeoc
complaint,
gotten
a
right
to
sue
letter,
and
then
gone
to
federal
court.
but
he
did
not
do
that
in
this
case,
and
we
think
that
that
is
the
critical
distinction
between
the
kremer
footnote
7,
if
footnote
7
is
construed
to
be
an
implied
repeal
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
doctrine
as
to
title
vii
cases,
which
is
apparently
what
the
sixth
circuit
felt.
but
this
court
did
not
say
that
as
i
read
footnote
7.
it
just
said
that
state
agency
adjudications
that
are
unreviewed
should
not.
it
didn't
say
that
they
shall
not.
it
just
said
they
should
not.
but
as
the
opinion
points
out
in
the
kremer
case,
nothing
required
the
claimant
in
that
case
to
appeal
his
state
administration
or
prescribed
the
weight
that
the
court
would
give
to
it.
and
that
is
the
same
with
respect
to
this
case.
and
i'd
like
to
same
the
next
five
minutes
for
rebuttal,
if
it
please
the
court.
thank
you.
mr.
beauchamp
e.
brogan
just
one
point,
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court:
with
respect
to
whether
respondent
received
a
full
and
fair
hearing
and
an
impartial
hearing,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
administrative
procedure
act
prescribes
the
procedure
whereby
the
claimant
or
the
employee
has
rights
to
this
full,
plenary
type
due
process
hearing,
which
is
similar
to
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
now,
at
no
time,
and
i
mean
no
time,
did
he
ever
object
to
the
appointment
of
the
hearing
officer.
he
could
have
done
so,
but
he
never
did.
instead,
he
deliberately,
voluntarily
litigated
this
issue
of
racial
discrimination
over
a
period
of
28
days
before
this
administrative
law
judge.
now,
if
he
thought
he
did
not
have
a
full
and
fair
hearing,
he
could
have
taken
that
up
immediately,
either
in
the
state
chancery
court
or
with
some
other
court.
if
a
federal
court
is
reviewing
this
question
as
to
whether
or
not
to
apply
the
doctrine
of
preclusion
in
the
first
case,
there
is
no
question
but
what
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
the
federal
court
can
look
to
see
whether
the
party
received
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
litigate.
and
i'm
pointing
out
that
the
record
is
devoid
of
any
claim
by
respondent.
when
he
went
back
to
the
district
court
and
when
he
went
to
the
court
of
appeals,
he
never
raised
the
issue
that
he
did
not
have
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
litigate
or
that
he
did
not
receive
a
full
and
fair
hearing.
he
did
not
seek
a
stay
of
the
administrative
agency
judgment,
which
he
had
an
absolute
right
to
do
under
state
law.
he
never
did
that.
mr.
beauchamp
e.
brogan
well,
we
would
like
to
think
that,
your
honor.
but
apparently
that's
not
always
the
case,
if
you
read
all
the
decisions
that
have
worked
its
way
up
to
this
court:
the
kremer
case,
the
allen
case,
the
migra
case.
and
this
case
here
is
a
splendid
example.
this
man
had
a
28
day
trial
in
the
state
court
and
he
still
wants
another
trial
on
those
identical
issues
in
federal
court.
and
we
think
that
to
have
a
law
of
non-preclusion,
where
a
litigant
can
invoke
a
hearing
to
protect
his
liberty
and
property
interests
under
the
due
process
rights,
which
this
court
says
you
have
to
afford
him
before
you
can
take
adverse
personnel
action
against
him,
would
work
just
the
opposite.
we're
different
from
a
private
employer.
a
private
employer
could
have
just
gone
ahead
and
terminated
him,
and
then
if
he
had
proceeded
through
the
eeoc
scheme,
it's
true
he
could
have
been
put
back
to
work.
but
under
this
court's
decisions,
the
state
is
the
victim,
the
state
has
no
choice
but
to
give
him
the
hearing
if
he
requests
it.
so
that
we
think
that
a
rule
of
non-preclusion
would
encourage,
rather
than
discourage,
litigants
from
going
into
federal
court.
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
thank
the
court.
