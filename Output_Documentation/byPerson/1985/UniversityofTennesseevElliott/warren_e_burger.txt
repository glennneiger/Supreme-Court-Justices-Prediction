we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
tennessee
against
elliott.
mr.
brogan,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.

but
that's
no
revelation,
because
that's
exactly
what
the
statute
says,
that
you
have
to
give
full
faith
and
credit
to
judicial
proceedings.
the
question
is
what
is
a
judicial
proceeding.

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
he
satisfied
the
preconditions
for
a
title
vii
suit,
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
question
i
wanted
to
ask
is,
supposing
after
the
termination
of
the
administrative
proceeding
and
without
seeking
review
at
all
in
the
state
court,
you
decided
you
had
an
independent
common
law
or
state
statutory
cause
of
action
that
you
wanted
to
bring
in
a
state
court
of
tennessee.
if
you
filed
that
kind
of
a
lawsuit,
would
the
administrative
proceeding
preclude
the
relitigation
of
issue
in
state
court
in
tennessee?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
brogan,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
