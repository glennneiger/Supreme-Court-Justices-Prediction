mr.
brogan,
the
respondent
here
stated
claims
under
both
title
vii
and
under
the
constitution,
did
he
not?
unknown
speaker
--and
you
claim
that
there
should
be
issue
preclusion
with
respect
to
both
of
those
claims?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
we
disagree
with
you
on
the
title
vii?
is
the
case
over
or
not?
unknown
speaker
what
difference
would
it
make
if
we
said
that
no
preclusion
under
title
vii?
what
would
be
left?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
the
plaintiff
would
still
have
further
relief
even
if
ha
could
get
all
the
relief
he
wanted
under
title
vii...
i
mean,
even
if
he
got
all
the
relief
that
title
vii
would
afford
him,
would
there
be
still
further
relief
under
his
other
cause
of
action?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
remedy?
unknown
speaker
mr.
brogan,
as
i
understand
it
the
respondent
claims
that
at
the
administrative
hearing
the
state
successfully
objected
to
his
efforts
to
introduce
evidence
of
discrimination
against
him,
at
the
administrative
proceeding,
and
he
was
precluded
from
offering
his
evidence.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
he
claims
is
that
the
administrative
hearing
officer
decided
the
issue
all
right,
but
wouldn't
let
him
offer
his
evidence
because
the
state
objected
to
it,
on
the
question
of
discrimination.
is
that
what
happened?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
brogan,
are
you
claiming
that
the
state
administrative
decision
is
a
judicial
proceeding
of
a
court
within
the
meaning
of
section
1738?
unknown
speaker
under
the
state
law,
if
you
seek
judicial
review
of
the
administrative
decision
where
do
you
seek
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
does
it...
is
it
de
novo?
unknown
speaker
or
is
it
on
the
record?
unknown
speaker
and
it's
not
a
new
hearing.
it's
just
a
question
of
substantial
evidence
or
some
violation
of
the
law,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
but
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
judge
macray.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
brogan,
section
1738,
as
your
know,
uses
the
term
"such
acts,
records,
and
judicial
proceedings.
"
and
don't
you
think
it
stretches
the
language
a
bit
to
say
that
a
proceeding
presided
over
by
an
administrative
law
judge
is
a
judicial
proceeding
in
the
sense
that
the
people
who
drafted
1738
used
it?
unknown
speaker
but
is
that
because
the
court
held
that
they
were
judicial
proceedings
within
the
meaning
of
1738
or
just
that
as
a
matter
of
common
law
preclusion
that
doctrine
ought
to
apply?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
brogan,
it
says
"judicial
proceeding
of
any
court".
unknown
speaker
but
the
clause
doesn't
bind
the
federal
government,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
ellis,
how
do
you
deal
with
our
decision
in
the
washington
gas
light
case?
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
do
that,
weren't
you
just
dealing
with
an
administrative
proceeding
in
the
district
of
columbia
there?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
ellis,
it
did
characterize
in
the
plurality
opinion
in
thomas
versus
washington
gas,
the
court
characterized
the
chicago
railroad
case
as
holding
that
the
fact
findings
of
state
administrative
tribunals
are
entitled
to
the
same
res
judicata
effect
in
the
second
state
as
findings
by
a
court.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
the
section
1983
claims?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know
how
that
bears
directly
on
this
case,
though,
because
in
this
case
the
respondent
himself
initiated
the
administrative
proceeding
in
the
tennessee
agency,
didn't
he?
there
was
nothing
under
tennessee
law
that
would
require
him
to
do
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
saying
that
if
he
had
not
gone
to
this
agency
proceeding
he
couldn't
have
come
into
federal
court
after
having
been
notified
of
his
termination
under
1983?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
he
did
voluntarily
initiate
this
agency
proceeding.
i
mean,
there's
no
way
of
getting
around
that,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
there's
nothing
under
federal
law
that
would
have
required
him
to
go
to
that
agency
at
all,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
but
he
could
get
it
back
if
he
won
his
federal
suit.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
a
fair
employment
practices
act
in
tennessee?
unknown
speaker
did
he
file
with
that
agency?
unknown
speaker
put
it
the
other
way--
unknown
speaker
--put
it
the
other
way--
unknown
speaker
--put
it
the
other
way.
exhausting
the
internal
university
procedures
would
not
satisfy
title
vii,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
so
he
would
still
have
to...
if
he
went
on
title
vii,
he
would
have
to
exhaust
the
fair
employment
practices
commission
procedures?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
see.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
but
if
there
were
no
procedural
irregularities,
would
it
then
be
based
on
the
record?
unknown
speaker
and
there
was
a
fair
hearing.
unknown
speaker
in
broad
terms,
mr.
brogan,
is
it
not
helpful
to
the
whole
system
if
administrative
dispositions
are
encouraged?
the
problems
may
go
away
if
they
are
free
to
take
an
administrative
route
first,
without
foreclosing
judicial
proceedings
later.
