mr.
jack
n.
goodman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
what
i
believe
is
particularly
important
in
understanding
this
case
and
which
appellant
generally
ignores
are
the
egregious
facts
on
which
it
is
based.
the
record
does
not
disclose
a
mere
failure
to
honor
a
claim
by
a
lower
level
person
at
the
aetna
office
in
alabama,
but
instead
shows
a
pattern
of
misconduct
not
only
the
officials
in
its
alabama
office,
but
also
senior
officials
in
its
home
office
and
its
medical
department,
and
this
misconduct
continued
on
for
years
and
extended
not
only
through
the
period
before
this
suit
was
filed,
but
also
continued
on
and
resulted
in
the
filing
by
aetna
of
several
affidavits
which
proved
to
be
false
in
an
effort
to
obtain
summary
judgment
from
the
alabama
trial
court.
and
aetna
recognizes,
this
court
must
accept
all
those
findings
as
fact,
and
indeed,
in
response
to
a
question,
no
justice
disputed
the
characterization
of
the
majority
opinion
of
the
alabama
supreme
court,
and
in
fact,
chief
justice
torbert's
dissenting
opinion
specifically
agreed
with
the
characterization
of
the
facts
in
the
majority
opinion.
the
alabama
courts
gave
very
long
and
very
careful
consideration
of
the
issues
that
arise
here,
both
in
this
case
and
in
earlier
cases,
and
as
this
court
held
in
martinez
v.
california,
the
interest
of
state
in
defining
their
own
tort
law
is
paramount
and
is
not
a
matter
of
constitutional
dimension.
this
suit
was
filed
in
1978,
and
over
the
next
six
years
reached
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
three
times.
at
no
time
during
that
a
period
was
there
ever
a
mention
of
any
federal
issues.
the
first
mention
of
any
federal
issues
came
at
the
very
end
of
the
alabama
litigation,
and
even
then
it
was
not
timely
raised,
for
aetna's
application
for
rehearing
raised
no
constitutional
issue,
and
the
first
constitutional
issues
were
raised
only
a
week
later
in
a
brief
supposedly
in
support
of
that
application.
and
while
aetna
now
claims
that
it
need
not
have
a
brief
which
hews
to
that
application
in
alabama,
it
did
file,
attempt
to
file
an
amendment
to
its
application
to
raise
the
issues.
further,
when
it
did
raise
them,
it
did
not
raise
them
in
compliance
with
alabama
procedure,
for
the
alabama
courts
have
long
held
that
they
will
not
consider
allegations,
particularly
constitutional
arguments,
which
are
not
supported
by
case
authority,
and
an
examination
of
the
brief
of
aetna
in
support
of
their
applications
for
rehearing
will
show
that
absolutely
no
cases
were
asserted,
that
it
was
a
mere
generalized
allegation
that
the
punitive
damages
award
and
the
alabama
affirmant
statute
were
unconstitutional.
mr.
jack
n.
goodman
well,
in
this
case,
justice
rehnquist,
they
seem,
at
this
level,
in
this
court,
to
have
found
a
number
of
cases
which
they
claim
support
it,
so
you
might...
in
a
completely
novel
argument
in
which
there
were
no
relevant
cases,
you
might
have
an
argument,
but
it
appears
that
that
would
not
apply
here.
mr.
jack
n.
goodman
chief
justice
burger,
we
do
not
agree
with
the
characterization
of
the
disparity
between
the
punitive
damages
award--
mr.
jack
n.
goodman
--that
is
only
if
you
accept
the
$1650
a
the
sole
damages
in
the
case,
but
you
have
to
remember
this
was
a
tort
case,
and
tort
damages
are
not
limited
by
contract
amount,
and
there
are
other
damages
which
are
included,
and
they
are
for
mental
anguish
and
economic
dislocation,
and
those,
as
the
alabama
supreme
court
found
in
the
gulf
life,
case
are
included
within
the
general
punitive
damages
amount,
and
indeed,
the
charge
here
which
was
not
accepted
to
by
the--
mr.
jack
n.
goodman
--by
the
appellate--
mr.
jack
n.
goodman
--there
is
no
direct
constitutional
limit
which
sets
a
particular
number
one
way
or
another--
mr.
jack
n.
goodman
--chief
justice
burger,
if
there
were
a
case
in
which
there
was
an
absolute
absence
of
protections
below,
in
other
words,
of
there
seemed
a...
if
the
evidence
showed
that
all
the
trial
courts
in
the
state
and
the
supreme
court
in
the
state
were
bent
on
destruction
of
a
company
and
the
amount
was
completely
out
of
line
with
amounts
for
any
similar
action
anywhere
in
the
united
states,
presumably
due
process
would
apply.
but
none
of
that
is
true
here.
this
amount
is
not
entirely
unusual,
given
the
size
of
awards
in
other
courts
for
the
sort
of
conduct
that
has
occurred,
and
you
also
have
to
remember
the
particularly
egregious
conduct.
the
alabama
court
has
only
found,
has
only
affirmed
a
judgment
of
bad
faith
in
four
cases
of
the
almost
40
that
they
have
considered
since
this
court--
mr.
jack
n.
goodman
--the
next
largest
one
i
believe
was
$1
1/4
million.
none
were
quite
this
high,
but
as
even
several
of
the
justice
indicated,
none
has
had
quite
this
level
of
misconduct.
to
return
briefly
to
the
jurisdiction
issue,
as
justice
o'connor
mentioned,
in
exxon
v.
eagerton,
the
court
recognized
that
the
alabama
practice
is
not
to
consider
issues
first
raised
on
a
rehearing.
and
the
cases
which
appellant
cites
do
not
show
a
different
practice.
to
take
one
example,
in
kirkland
v.
kirkland,
which
we
cited
for
the
proposition
that
alabama
courts
will
not
consider
arguments
first
raised
on
appeal,
that
is
precisely
what
the
court
said
there.
now,
they
did
go
on
to
consider
the
issues,
and
found,
and
would
have
found
in
favor,
indicated
that
their
judgment
would
have
been
in
favor
of
the
applicant
for
rehearing
but
did
not
apply
it
in
that
case.
it
was
mere
dicta,
and
suggested
if
the
case
came
up
again,
that
would
be
the
view
the
court
held.
similarly,
in
lovett
v....
in
stover,
i'm
sorry,
the
court
also
said
that
it
was
their
very
clear
policy
that
they
would
not
hear
cases
that...
hear
issues
that
were
first
raised
on
rehearing,
and
while
no
doubt
there
are
some
cases
in
which
they
have
done
so,
that
is
certainly
appropriate
that
it
is
within
the
alabama
court's
power
to
hear
the
case,
to
hear
an
issue
first
raised
on
hearing,
based
on
their
general
power
to
amend
their
judgments
sua
sponte
during
the
term
of
court
in
which
they
are
issued,
but
that
does
not
indicate
an
obligation
on
their
part
to
hear
issues
which
are
untimely
raised,
nor
does
it
indicate
that
these
few
cases
exist
in
the
absence
of
established
practice,
which
is
what
they
sat
they
have,
to
not
hear
cases
raised.
in
fact,
in
the
orr
case
this
court
recognized
specifically
that
while
the
alabama
court
had
considered
an
untimely
argument
there,
the
court
was
free
in
another
case
to
not
consider
that
argument,
and
the
court
strongly
suggested
there
that
that
would
preclude
this
court's
jurisdiction.
it
has
been
held
consistently
by
this
court
for
almost
200
years
that
failure
to
timely
raise
a
federal
issue
in
state
proceedings
precludes
this
court's
jurisdiction.
and
that
conclusion
should
be
applied
here,
and
we
submit
that
this
case
should
be
dismissed.
turning
to
the
arguments
concerning
justice
embry,
the
practice
of
this
court,
which
is
the
same
practice
as
has
been
endorsed
by
the
aba
for
appellate
courts
in
the
states,
is
to
generally
entrust
the
decision
on
disqualification
of
a
judge
in
an
appellate
court
to
that
judge,
and
that
is
the
practice
which
the
alabama
court
followed
here,
so
that
the
court
itself
did
not
consider
that
federal
issues
were
raised.
mr.
jack
n.
goodman
well,
there
are
canons,
and
the
canons...
the
canons
of
judicial
conduct
do
apply
in
alabama,
but
the
ada,
justice
blackmun,
in
considering
the
proper
procedure,
concluded
that
the
best
practice,
particularly
given
the
controls
that
were
available
from
the
fact
that
they
were
collegial
courts
and
there
were
other
justices
or
other
judges,
would
be
to
leave
the
matter
to
the
individual
judge.
i
would
suppose,
and
we
would
not
disagree,
that
there
may
be
a
case
of
a
complete
abuse
of
discretion
where
this
court
could
step
in
and
apply
constitutional
standards
and
indicates
that
there
had
been
a
complete
absence
of
the
exercise
of
discretion.
mr.
jack
n.
goodman
well,
we
would
argue
that
it
is
not
because--
mr.
jack
n.
goodman
--it
appears
now,
your
honor,
that
he
did,
that
there
was
a
payment
of
$30,000
which
blue
cross
indicated
their
belief
was
to
compensate
him
for
his
legal
fees
in
bringing
the
case.
mr.
jack
n.
goodman
the
record
is
unclear,
intelligence.
mr.
jack
n.
goodman
the
fact
is
he
received
$30,000.
the
facts
are
that
blue
cross...
the
internal
blue
cross
documents
indicate
that
they
believe
that
payment
was
in
compensation
for
his
legal
expenses.
whether
that
was
so
or
not,
i
don't
know,
your
honor,
and
i
believe
the
record
indicates.
mr.
jack
n.
goodman
the
case
was
settled
in
late
april
of
this
year.
mr.
jack
n.
goodman
yes,
that's
correct.
he
was...
he
was
asking
on
behalf
of
a
class
for
considerably
more
money.
mr.
jack
n.
goodman
no,
your
honor,
he
is
not.
he
is
retired,
and
i
understand
that
was
for
health
reasons.
mr.
jack
n.
goodman
i
believe
he's
in
his
mid
to
late
60s,
your
honor.
as
counsel
for
appellant
stated,
the
interest
that
justice
embry
had
here
was
not
an
interest
in
this
case,
but--
mr.
jack
n.
goodman
--your
honor,
we
would
not
suggest
that
it
is
a
question
of
the
amount
of
the
damages,
but--
mr.
jack
n.
goodman
--no,
i
believe,
your
honor,
it
was
a
question
of
if
the
characterization
of
the
entire
procedure
below
was
such
that
it
was
an
absence
of
due
process,
that
it
seemed
a
campaign
of
harassment
or
destruction,
we
would
agree
that
an
egregious
amount
would...
an
amount,
say,
for
example,
which
would
destroy
a
company
or
destroy
an
individual,
might
raise
a
due
process
issue.
but
we
have
nothing
like
that
either
in
terms
of
the
absence
of
careful
procedure
here
or
in
terms
of
the
size
of
the
judgment
given
the
size
of
the
defendant
in
the
case.
mr.
jack
n.
goodman
i
don't
believe
there
was,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
n.
goodman
no,
your
honor,
but
i
believe
it
would
be
a
question
for
this
court
in
order
for
it
to
determine
that
there
had
been,
we
would
suggest
this
sort
of
campaign
of
harassment.
mr.
jack
n.
goodman
we
would
again
argue
that
the
mere
dollar
size
in
itself
could
not
be
enough,
but
we
would
also
suggest
that
an
amount
that
was
that
high
would
indicate
that
there
were...
there
was
an
absence
of
other
procedures,
an
absence
of
the
sort
of
care
and
consideration
which
properly
was
given.
mr.
jack
n.
goodman
that's
correct,
and
in
that
case,
even
in
martinez,
although
the
court
suggested
in
martinez
that
the
state's
interest
in
its
tort
law
is
paramount,
and
we
hold
to
that
very
carefully,
it
indicated
that
in
a
case
where
there
was
a
completely
irrational
judgment,
invading
the
rights
of
a
person,
that
the
court
might
step
in.
but
that
would
be
a
very
limited
instance.
and
this
case
did
not
present
such
an
instance.
the
point
about
justice
embry
is
that
he
was
not
sitting
in
his
own
case.
he...
the
federal
disqualification
statute
which
need
be
considered
stricter
than
the
federal--
mr.
jack
n.
goodman
--no,
justice
brennan,
it
did
not
because
he
laid
down
no
principle
in
this
case.
in
this
case
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
replete
with
statements
that
he
is
relying
on
the
unique
facts
of
this
case
and
saying
in
this
case,
the
two
particular
aspects
which--
mr.
jack
n.
goodman
--that
is
correct.
mr.
jack
n.
goodman
that
is
correct.
mr.
jack
n.
goodman
that
is
also
correct.
mr.
jack
n.
goodman
not
in
any
direct
sense.
mr.
jack
n.
goodman
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
it,
the
mere
fact
that
there
was
a
judgment
in
one
case
on
one
set
of
facts
which
particularly
rests
on
those
unique
facts
and
the
unique
pattern
of
misconduct
has
no
direct
bearing
on
the
question
in
another
case
of
whether
there
will
be
a
judgment.
mr.
jack
n.
goodman
the
general
holding
on
disqualification
cases
has
been
that
the
mere
establishment
of
a
pattern
of
law,
in
other
words,
the
setting
up
of
the
law
which
might
later
benefit
the
judge
in
another
case
is
not
disqualifying,
but
the
judge's
interest
must
be
direct
and
immediate
in
the
case
at
bar
and
not
in
some
other
case,
and
not
in
the
development
of
a
law
in
a
way
which
might
ultimately
benefit
him.
mr.
jack
n.
goodman
for
example,
in
the
department
of...
in
the
case
in
the
temporary
emergency
court
of
appeals,
doe
v.
bremmer,
which
we
argue
in
our
brief,
there
the
evidence
was
very
clear
that
the
judge
in
question
owned
stock
in
oil
companies
which
had
investments
identical
to
the
ones
in
front
of
him,
and
that
his
decision
would
affect
the
value
of
those
companies
one
way
or
the
other,
and
the
court
held,
applying
federal
statutory
standards
again,
that
that
was
an
interest
that
was
too
remote
and
too
speculative,
and
that
the
interest
under
the
federal
statute,
and
again,
a
stricter
standard
than
the
constitution
applies,
had
to
be
direct
and
in
the
case
at
bar.
mr.
jack
n.
goodman
your
honor--
mr.
jack
n.
goodman
--chief
justice
burger,
the
court
applied
the
principle
it
had
established
in
the
chavers
case
and
thereafter
which
indicated
that
a
bad
faith
denial
of
claims
by
an
insurance
company
will
give
rise
to
a
tort
action
which
may
result
in
punitive
damages.
the
two
issues
this
aetna
has
argued
were...
in
which
alabama
law
were
changed
were
a
statement
in
earlier
cases
that
as
a
general
matter,
a
partial
payment
of
an
insurance
claim
would
preclude
a
finding
of
bad
faith,
and
second,
that
in
order
for
bad
faith
to
be
shown,
the
plaintiff
must
establish
that
on
the
contract
claim
he
would
be
entitled
to
a
directed
verdict.
and
in
both
of...
and
in
both
of
those
instances,
the
court
previously
had
not
established
an
absolute
rule
but
merely
a
general
presumption,
rebuttable
on
showing
of
specific
facts,
and
that
characterization
of
the
previous
cases
is
not
one
only
of
the
majority
opinion,
but
was
the
unanimous
holding
of
the
court
here
for
both
dissents
agreed
with
the
majority
opinion
on
both
those
issues
which
were
the
two
ones
which
aetna
has
argued
would
have
benefitted
justice
embry
in
his
case.
mr.
jack
n.
goodman
yes.
mr.
jack
n.
goodman
in
the
court's
opinion
or
in
the
trial--
mr.
jack
n.
goodman
--in
the
trial
court.
as
far
as
the
punitive
damages,
they
were
charged,
in
addition
to
the
matters
in
which
mr.
olson
described,
they
were
also
charged
with
respect
to
the
gulf
life
standard,
which
indicated
that
they
should
take
into
consideration
the
economic
dislocation
and
the
mental
anguish
which
the
lavoies
had
suffered.
there
was
substantial
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
lavoies
had
been
pursued
rather
mercilessly
by
the
hospital
in
order
to
make
this
payment
and
were
unable
to
do
so.
finally,
with
respect
to
justice
embry,
his
voting
record
in
other
bad
faith
cases
shows
that
he
was
not
acting
out
of
his
own
interest
for
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
that
he
sat
on
during
the
time
when
his
suit
was
being
prosecuted,
he
voted
in
favor
of
the
insurer,
including
three
times
on
the
identical
directed
verdict
standard
which
the
appellant
argues
he
had
set
out
to
change.
and
so
there
is
little
reason
to
believe
on
this
very
scanty
record
that
he
had
any
interest
and
he
was
doing
anything
improper.
but
where,
but
to
the
contrary,
where
blue
cross
was
a
party
before
him,
i.e.,
the
party
against
whom
he
was
suing,
he
very
carefully
recused
himself,
and
that
occurred
only
two
weeks
after
the
decision
in
the
case
at
bar.
mr.
jack
n.
goodman
i'm
not
certain,
justice
stevens.
mr.
jack
n.
goodman
well,
he
did
write--
mr.
jack
n.
goodman
--that
is
correct.
mr.
jack
n.
goodman
well,
that's
true,
but
of
course,
it
also
shows
that
he
convinced
four
other
justices,
and
as
i
have
said,
justice
marshall,
the
dissenting
justices
did
not...
two
of
the
dissenting
justices
did
not
disagree
with
the
characterization
of
the
case
at
all,
and
the
other
two...
and
that
remains
only
two,
and
they
basically
indicated
that
they
had
a
dispute
as
to
the
weight
of
the
facts.
but
the
legal
judgments
that
he
reached
were
not
disputed
by
any
of
the
justices
of
the
alabama
supreme
court.
so
that
is...
that
simply
did
not
occur.
turning
to
the
eighth
amendment
and
the
punitive
damages
issue,
the
eighth
amendment
argument
which
appellant
raises
is
squarely
rejected
by
this
court's
holding
in
ingraham,
and
in
that
case
the
court
carefully
mined
the
history
of
the
right
amendment
and
found,
for
example,
that
the
english
bill
of
rights,
which
appellant
relies
on,
that
it
was
clearly
intended
to
apply
only
to
criminal
cases
and
that
the
conjunction
of
fines,
excessive
bail
and
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
indicated
an
intent
to
restrict
the
applicability
of
the
amendment
to
criminal
cases.
and
this
court
has
held
that
in
the
absence
of
the
criminal
process
and
the
indicia
of
the
criminal
process,
there
is
no
application
of
the
eighth
amendment,
and
there
is
no
such
indicia
here.
this
case
was
a
purely
civil
case
and
handled
in
a
purely
civil
manner.
it
is
clear,
therefore,
that
all
punishments
are
not
within
the
scope
of
the
amendment,
and
this
punishment
is
not
one
of
them.
nor
did
this
award
offend
due
process
in
any
manner.
contrary
to
aetna's
argument
that
it
had
no
notice
of
the
substantive
conduct
which
it
was
expected
to
adhere
to,
alabama
has
held
for
many,
many
years
that
insurers
have
a
fiduciary
duty
with
respect
to
their
insured,
so
that
substantive
conduct,
good
faith
towards
towards
the
insured
was
already
a
duty.
the
only
thing
that
was
added
in
1981
was
a
tort
action
to
recover
for
breach
of
that
duty,
that
the
court
had
long
held
that
a...
that
insurer's
did
have
that
fiduciary
duty,
and
there
is
no
construction
of
alabama
law
which
would
have
supported
the
type
of
misconduct
which
fills
the
record
in
this
case,
the
repeated
lying
to
claimants
and
failure
to
follow
internal
company
procedures.
aetna's
arguments
here
were
head
by
the
trial
judge
on
motions
for
new
trial
and
remittitur,
and
by
the
supreme
court
of
alabama,
and
that
is
the
court
which
is
most
able
to
and
properly
should
under
our
constitutional
scheme
determine
what
the
standard
for--
mr.
jack
n.
goodman
--there
was
a
previous
award
which
was
reduced
from,
i
believe,
$1
million
to
$100,000,
but
there
has
been
one
of,
i
believe,
$1
1/4
million.
mr.
jack
n.
goodman
since
this
case,
i
believe...
well,
i
believe
that
decision
came
out
shortly
after
this
case.
mr.
jack
n.
goodman
none
which
the
court
had
affirmed
for
over
$100,
000,
that's
correct.
of
course,
in
other
states
there
have
been
awards
not
substantially
different
from
this,
and
of
course,
many
of
these
awards
are
reduced
in
appropriate
circumstances
by
remittitur
or
on
appeal
and
that
is
the
protection
which
is
generally
afforded
to
litigants.
the
rule
proposed
by
aetna
would
essentially
vitiate
the
development
of
the
common
law
process
in
the
states
because
it
would
suggest
that
there
could
be
no
new
common
law
duty
attached
except
prospectively,
which
would
essentially
preclude
anyone
from
seeking
a
new
remedy
because
it
could
not
benefit
them.
it
would
also,
the
rule
that
they
propose
which
would
allow
this
court
to
freely
consider
the
amount
of
punitive
damages
as
a
constitutional
matter,
would
flood
this
court
with
new
litigation,
for
there
is,
and
aetna
has
suggested
none,
no
federal
standard
which
is
different
from
the
excessiveness
standard
which
is
already
applied
by
every
state
court.
so
we
believe
that
this
case
should
be...
the
issues
in
this
case
were
properly
handled
by
the
supreme
court
of
alabama,
and
they
are
properly
left
to
the
discretion
of
the
state
courts.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
