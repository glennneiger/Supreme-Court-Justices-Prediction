unknown
speaker
the
respondent
points
out
its
view
for
differing
with
you
on
a
number
of
those
cases
and
suggests
the
few
remaining
ones
don't
establish
a
practice.
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course,
other
people
joined
his
opinion.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
don't
really
know.
he
may
have...
he
may
have
started
out
with
a
completely
different
opinion
and
other
people
said
please
change
it
and
we'll
join
it.
unknown
speaker
that
that
didn't
happen.
unknown
speaker
i
know.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
may
have
because
he
changed
it.
unknown
speaker
in
any
event,
it
was
five
to
four,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
was
this
the
first
case
in
which,
the
alabama
supreme
court
had
laid
down
the
principle
it
followed
here?
unknown
speaker
doesn't
the
very
term
carry
that
with
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
was
that
the
substance
of
the
charge
to
the
jury
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
was
there
any
analytical
treatment
or
discussion
in
connection
with
the
efforts
to
reduce
the
punitive
damage
in
the
trial
court?
unknown
speaker
mr.
olson,
none
of
these
arguments
were
made
before
the
petitions
for
rehearing,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
and
of
course,
we
do
have
to
look
at
what
this
court
said
in
exxon
corporation
v.
eagerton
about
the
general
rule
of
the
alabama
courts.
unknown
speaker
are
you
relying
significantly
on
the
disqualification
aspect?
unknown
speaker
of
justice
embry?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
haven't,
you
haven't
gone
into
that
yet.
unknown
speaker
now,
also
tell
us
how
we
reach
that
sort
of
a
question
in
a
state
court.
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--judge
embry's
participation.
this
is...
if
this
were
a
federal
district
judge
or
a
court
of
appeals
judge,
we
would
have
quite
a
different
question,
wouldn't
we?
unknown
speaker
supervisory
power?
unknown
speaker
well
what
precisely
is
your
claim
that
judge
embry
should
have
disqualified
himself,
not
under
alabama
law
but
under
some
constitutional
principle?
unknown
speaker
well,
okay,
but
what
was
unfair
about
justice
embry's
participation
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
and
your
theory
is
that
because
he
was
a
justice
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama,
which
has
a
lot
to
say
about
different
branches
of
the
law
in
alabama,
he
shouldn't
have
sat
in
any
case
involving
an
area
of
the
law
in
which
he
himself
had
a
lawsuit
pending?
unknown
speaker
if
that's
the
principle,
no
state
supreme
court
justice
can
ever
file
a
suit
on
his
own
behalf.
unknown
speaker
i
just
don't
read
that
deposition
that
way.
certainly
he
expressed
tremendous
dissatisfaction
with
blue
cross
in
dis
own
case,
but
it
seems
to
me
the
deposition
gives
the
impression
that
he
was
going
to
treat
insurance
companies
on
the
basis
of
how
they
treated
him,
that
he
would
be,
you
know,
as
a
claimant,
if
the
company
treated
him
well,
he
wasn't
a
litigant,
litigation
prone
person.
unknown
speaker
now,
certainly
the
fact
that
a
justice
of
a
state
supreme
court
has
strong
feelings
about
insurance
companies
cannot
possibly
disqualify
him
from
sitting
in
insurance
cases
in
the
supreme
court,
can
it?
unknown
speaker
i
would
hope
you
wouldn't.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
olson
wasn't
judge
embry
in
a
position
where
his
decision
here
was
going
to
have
a
bearing
on
whether
he
got
money
in
his
pocket
in
the
cases
that
he
had
brought?
unknown
speaker
incidentally,
monroeville
was
a
state
court,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
what--
unknown
speaker
--no,
no,
i
am
talking
about
our
decision
on
ward
v.
monroeville.
didn't
that
involve
a
state
judge?
unknown
speaker
and
wasn't
that...
didn't
that
go
off
on
a
due
process
analysis?
unknown
speaker
well,
were
these
issues
on
which
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
divided
in
this
particular
case?
did
the
dissenting
justices
disagree
with
judge
embry's
interpretation
of
alabama
law?
unknown
speaker
before
you
leave
the
due
process
issue,
assume
we
found
merit
in
that
and
nothing
else,
just
to
get
my
question
on
the
table.
what
would
the
appropriate
relief
be?
unknown
speaker
well,
which
part
of
the
alabama
court
system?
unknown
speaker
but
does
the...
is
your
conclusion
on
the
due
process
issue
that
the
judgment
of
the
alabama
supreme
court
is
void?
unknown
speaker
then
is
not
the
effect
of
that
to
allow
the
district
court
judgment
to
stand,
which
would
affirm?
unknown
speaker
a
trial
court
judgment,
yes.
unknown
speaker
does
federal
law
entitle
you
to
an
appeal?
unknown
speaker
i'm
saying
does
federal
law?
do
we
have
any
power
to
command
that
you
be
given
a
right
of
appeal?
unknown
speaker
do
we
have
any
authority
to
enforce
that
statute?
unknown
speaker
you're
willing
to
take
your
risk
if
you
get
the
judgment
vacated.
unknown
speaker
but
should
we
decide
these
issues
before
they've
been
decided
by
a
properly
constituted
alabama
supreme
court?
unknown
speaker
on
an
appeal
from
a
void
judgment.
it
seems
to
me
you...
we
either
have
a
judgment
that
we
can
review
or
we
don't,
and
your
suggestion
on
the
due
process
argument
is
that
there
really
is
nothing
worthy
of
review.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
court
didn't
give
you
a
fair
hearing
on
those
other
issues?
unknown
speaker
those
are
the
only
other
issues
there
are.
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
it
shouldn't...
if
you
want
to
submit
them,
you
shouldn't
have
brought
your
due
process
question
here.
unknown
speaker
plus,
we
didn't
limit
our
note
either,
did
we?
unknown
speaker
mr.
olson,
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
that
any
of
the
other
justices
know
about
the
class
action
before
issuing
the
opinion
on
the
merits
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
they
had
to
know
about
it.
unknown
speaker
after
the
opinion
issued.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
what
if
your
claim
is
so
novel
there
aren't
any
cases
to
support
it?
how
do
you
comply
with
that
rule?
unknown
speaker
has
there
ever
been
a
case
in
any
court
in
the
united
states,
state
or
federal,
presenting
this
kind
of
disparity
between
the
actual
injury
and
the
punitive
damage
award?
unknown
speaker
isn't
there
a
disparity
between
there
two
figures?
unknown
speaker
and
your
position
is
that--
unknown
speaker
--your
position
is
there
can
be
no
limit
on
that
kind
of
a
punitive
award,
though.
unknown
speaker
what
if
it
was
$30
million
instead
of
$3
million?
unknown
speaker
any
of
them
anywhere
near
like
this
one?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
there
must
be
a
limit
to
that.
there
certainly
is
on
the
federal
side
in
the
canons
of
federal
judges.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
the
opposition
will
say
that
this
is
that
case.
unknown
speaker
did
justice
embry
accept
payment
in
settlement
of
his
cases?
unknown
speaker
so
that
he
did
not
personally,
you
say,
realize
a
penny.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
the
fact?
what
is
the
fact,
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
when
was
it
settled?
unknown
speaker
so
that
at
the
time
this
case
was
litigated,
at
least
he
was
asking
for
more.
unknown
speaker
is
justice
embry
still
sitting
as
a
member
of
the
court?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
his
age?
unknown
speaker
before
you
go
on,
let
me
interrupt
you
to
ask
another
question.
you
indicated,
i
thought,
that
at
some
point,
a
reaction
on
a
punitive
damage
might
get
to
the
point
where
it
would,
whether
shock
the
conscience
or
what.
what
point
would
that
be
in
something
over
$3
1/2
million
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
you
had.
unknown
speaker
well,
was
there
any
evidence
introduced
in
this
case
showing
what
would
be
the
impact
on
the
insurer
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
that
isn't
really
a
factor,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
let
me
test,
let
me
test
that
out,
if
i
may.
suppose
this
award
had
been
not
$3
1/2
million
or
$30
million
but
$350
million.
does
that
get
to
the
point
where
some
shock
factor
comes
in
and
a
federal
court
could
intervene
when
it
couldn't
at
a
lower
figure?
unknown
speaker
an
absence
of
rationality.
unknown
speaker
well,
tell
me,
mr.
goodman,
you
say
he
was
not
sitting
in
his
own
case.
did
not
the
principle
he
laid
down
in
this
case
help
suits
he
had
brought
against
blue
cross?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about,
what
about...
i
thought
that...
i
think
it's
been
suggested
that
the
first
time
this
tort
was
recognized
by
the
alabama
supreme
court,
at
least,
was
in
1981?
unknown
speaker
but
that
was
applied
here.
unknown
speaker
but
by
a
vote
of
five
to
four.
unknown
speaker
and
would
that
not
help
his
own
suit
against
the--
unknown
speaker
--direct
or
indirect,
wouldn't
it
help
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it
did
help
his
case
to
the
extent
of
putting
money
in
his
pocket,
then
did
he
not
have
a
personal
interest
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
i
have...
go
ahead
and
finish.
unknown
speaker
you
referred
to...
at
least
i
got
the
impression
you
said
that
there
was
no
principle
laid
down
by
the
court
in
establishing
or
affirming
this
$3
1/2
million
penalty.
what
principle
would
you
say
that
the
proposition
rests
on?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
principal
basis
of
the
court's
holding?
unknown
speaker
now,
in
criminal
cases
i
suppose
you
would
agree
in
alabama,
judges
must
instruct
particularly
on
a
capital
case
on
the
factors
which
must
be
taken
into
account,
that
this
court
has
laid
down,
is
that
not
true?
unknown
speaker
was
there
any
limiting
principle
given
by
way
of
instruction
here?
unknown
speaker
in
the
trial
court.
unknown
speaker
in
any
of
the
three
cases
in
which
he
voted
against
the
insurance
company,
would
his
vote
have
made
a
difference?
unknown
speaker
but
in
this
case
he
did
throw
his
weight
around.
unknown
speaker
he
started
out
with
a
dissenting
opinion
and
ended
up
with
a
majority.
unknown
speaker
that
shows
some
movement.
unknown
speaker
wasn't
that
the
one
in
which
there
was
a
big
remittitur
of
$1
million?
unknown
speaker
since
this
case.
since
this
one,
is
that
what
it
is?
unknown
speaker
but
at
the
time
of
this
decision
there
had
been
none
over
$100,000?
