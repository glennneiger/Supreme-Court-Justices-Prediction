mr.
theodore
b.
olson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
an
appeal
under
28
u.s.c.
section
1257(2)
from
a
judgment
of
the
alabama
supreme
court
upholding
the
constitutionality
of
an
alabama
law
which
imposes
a
10
percent
penalty
on
an
unsuccessful
money
judgment.
underneath
the
dispute
with
respect
to
jurisdiction,
there
is
a
well-established
alabama
practice
which
we
believe
and
we
have
discussed,
in
the
briefs
resolves
the
questions
which
have
been
raised
about
jurisdiction
both
with
respect
to
the
10
percent
appeal
penalty
under
the
alabama
law,
and
with
respect
to
the
other
issues
which
are
brought
to
this
court
with
this
appeal.
there
is
a
well-established
alabama
practice
of
considering
issues
which
have
been
raised
on
rehearing
or
in
other
postjudgment
motions.
we
cited
to
the
court
17
cases
in
our
briefs
in
which
section
12-22-72
of
the
alabama
code
was
raised
in
a
postjudgment
petition
for
rehearing
context.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
we
respectfully,
of
course,
disagree,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
those,
the
cases...
the
appellees
have
attempted
to
narrow
down
those
cases,
but
in
their
efforts
to
narrow
down
them
present
a
distinction
without
a
difference.
the
fact
is
that
questions
of
construction
or
the
questions
of
the
application
of
that
particular
statute
have
been
raised
in
that
postjudgment
rehearing
context.
in
addition,
as
we
set
out
in
our
brief,
we
presented
over
two
dozen
cases,
and
in
fact,
we
pointed
out
to
the
fact
that
a
number
of
the
cases
raised
by
appellees
themselves
involve
situations
where
the
courts
of
alabama
discussed
a
rule
but
then
went
on
to
rule
on
the
merits.
the
fact
is
that
to
the
extent
that
there
is
an
articulation
from
time
to
time
of
a
rule
that
issues
cannot
be
raised
at
that
posture
of
the
proceeding,
the
court
has
gone
on
to
do
so
in
a
regular
basis.
there
is
no
strict
or
regularly
followed
rule
which
would
preclude
raising
the
issues
at
the
time
that
they
were
raised
in
this
case.
before
moving
on
to
some
of
the
issues
in
this
case,
i
would
like
to
briefly
just
emphasize,
and
because
the
facts
are
somewhat
complicated,
i
will
not
have
an
opportunity
with
the
time
available
to
discuss
all
of
the
facts,
we
accept
as
we
must
the
facts
which
are
set
forth
in
the
record
before
this
court
and
as
articulated
by
the
alabama
supreme
court.
i
simply
wanted,
unless
the
court
would
prefer
a
longer
discussion
of
the
facts,
to
recite
or
call
to
the
court's
attention
two
particular
aspects
of
the
facts
as
set
forth
in
the
alabama
supreme
court.
first
of
all,
those
facts
as
set
forth
by
the
alabama
supreme
court
opinion
were
edited,
selected
and
set
to
music,
as
it
were,
by
justice
embry,
the
justice
of
the
alabama
supreme
court
whose
conduct
is
called
into
question
here
so
that
while
we
do
not
dispute,
as
we
cannot,
the
facts
in
that
case,
the
emphasis,
the
characterization
of
the
facts,
is
due
to
the
fact
or
must
be
considered
in
light
of
the
circumstances
that
was
written
by
justice
embry.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that
is
correct,
and
we
are
not
disputing
the
fact
that
other
people
joined
his
opinion
with
respect
to
the
holding
of
the
alabama
supreme
court,
but
that
the
characterization
of
those
facts
in
that
case
must
be
understood
in
the
context
that
they
were
written
by
the
justice
who,
as
we
have
demonstrated,
had
a
very
strong
interest
in
the
outcome
of
the
case.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
justice
white,
he
testified
at
his
deposition,
which
is
a
part
of
the
material
before
the
court--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that...
well,
he
started
out
to
write
a
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
and
then
sometime
shortly
before
the
final
decision,
that
opinion
became
the
majority
opinion
of
the
court.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
suppose
that
inference
is
possible.
the
inference
which
is
quite
strong
from
reading
that
transcript
of
the
deposition
is
that
that
is
not
what
happened.
another
aspect
of
that
facts--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
decision
was
five
to
four,
yes,
justice
blackmun.
the
other
aspect
of
the
facts
of
the
case
which
it
seems
to
me
are
important
for
the
court
to
understand
as
it
considers
this
case
is
that
while
the
alabama
supreme
court,
the
jury
in
alabama
and
the
alabama
supreme
court
reached
a
conclusion
that
there
had
been
a
bad
faith
failure
to
pay
an
insurance
claim
in
this
case,
it
was
not
the
policies
of
appellant
that
brought
about
that
conclusion;
it
was
deviation,
unauthorized
deviations
from
those
policies
that
led
to
the
conclusion
that
there
had
been
bad
faith
failure
to
pay
an
insurance
claim.
i
would
like
to
speak--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
that
question
is
complicated
because
there
are
several
principles
that
are
articulated
here,
justice
brennan
the
alabama
supreme
court
had
first
accepted
the
doctrine
that
there
could
be
a
tort
claim
and
a
claim
for
punitive
damages
for
bad
faith
in
1981.
we
stress
in
our
brief,
and
we
stress
in
our
argument
that
that
was
four
years
after
the
conduct
here.
the
decision
in
this
case
follows
the
precedents
established
in
1981
in
alabama,
but
there
were
changes
in
the
law,
we
contend,
and
we
have
discussed
those
in
detail
in
our
briefs,
in
the
decision
of
the
alabama
supreme
court
in
this
case.
as
the
court
is
aware,
the
major
issue
in
this
case
is
the
question
of
punitive
damages
and
the
extent
to
which
this
court
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
has
the
power
to
limit
under
the
eighth
amendment
particularly,
and
also
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
the
power
to
limit
punitive
damages.
before
i
discuss
the
constitutional
application
particularly
in
the
context
of
the
eighth
amendment
to
punitive
damage,
i
would
like
to
go
over
some
of
the
characteristics
of
punitive
damages
which
have
been
pointed
out
and,
i
believe,
agreed
to
by
his
court
in
various
opinions
of
this
court
virtually
without
dissent.
one
of
the
characteristics
of
punitive
damages
which
is
most
important
to
this
discussion
is
that...
and
this
is
in
the
words
of
justice
marshall
in
dissenting
in
the
rosenbloom
v.
metromedia
case,
but
the
same
language
has
been
picked
up
by
other...
in
other
opinions
of
this
court,
particularly
in
the
gertz
case
and
in
the
faust
case,
punitive
damages
serve
the
same
function
as
criminal
penalties
and
are
in
effect
private
fines.
that
phrase
"private
fines"
particularly
has
been
approved
by
this
court
in
several
different
ways
in
several
opinions
of
this
court.
there
is
really
no
question
that
the
purpose
for
punitive
damages
are
to...
is
to
punish
and
deter.
the
purpose
again
of
punitive
damage
is
to
prevent
or
deter
or
punish
perceived
antisocial
behavior
through
fines.
secondly,
punitive
damages
are
windfalls.
they
are
entirely
extracompensatory.
in
a
sense,
they
are
like
a
lottery.
three,
punitive
damages
are
awarded
virtually
without
standards.
this
again...
these
are
propositions
which
have
been
articulated
by
this
court.
there
are
no
legislative
guidelines,
or
virtually
seldom
are
legislative
guidelines.
there
are
no
restraints
built
into
the
system
on
the
passion
or
prejudice
of
the
jury.
in
fact,
as
this
court
has
noted,
punitive
damages
may
be
used
to
punish
unpopular
defendants.
it
is
the
one
area
of
the
law
in
which
passion
and
prejudice
seems
almost
to
be
encouraged
by
the
process.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
it
certainly
does,
and
as
we
have
seen,
the
fact
that
the
punitive
damages
themselves
are
for
the
purpose
of
punishment
and
deterrence,
and
that
the
juries
are
instructed
that
they
virtually
have
no
discretion,
if
the
jury
is
angry
at
the
defendant,
or
if
the
jury
is
angry
at
the
defendant
irrespective
of
the
conduct
that
may
have
occurred
in
the
case,
this
is
an
opportunity
for
them
to
punish
the
jury...
punish
that
defendant.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
substance
of
the
charge
to
the
jury
in
this
case...
and
there's
a
reference
in
our
reply
brief
to
the
page
at
which
that
appears
in
the
record...
is
that
punitive
damages
were
for
the
purpose
of
punishment
and
deterrence.
the
trial
court
went
on
to
say
that
punitive
damages
are
primarily
in
the
discretion
of
the
jury
and
then
concluded
that
very
brief
statement
by
saying
it
is
up
to
the
jury
to
reach
a
judgment
with
respect
to
how
much
the
punitive
damages
ought
to
be,
bearing
in
mind
the
consideration
of
punishment
and
deterrence.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
there
was
an
application
to
reduce
the
punitive
damages
in
the
trial
court.
the
trial
court,
of
course,
already
had
been
of
the
view
that
punitive
damages
were
primarily
in
the
discretion
of
the
jury.
again
when
the
subject
came
up
in
the
alabama
supreme
court,
the
subject
was
quite
fleeting
and
reflected,
it
seems
to
me,
the
very
point
that
i
made
and
that
has
been
made
by
this
court.
there
are
very
few,
if
any,
standards.
those
standards,
if
they
exist,
are
totally
discretionary.
another
characteristic
of
punitive
damages
which
has
been
mentioned
by
this
court
is
that
while
they
serve
the
criminal
law
function.
they
are
awarded
in
amounts
generally
far
higher
than
crimes
for
comparable
criminal
conduct,
and
i
might
add
that
the
english
courts
have
particularly
made
this
point
and
focused
on
it
as
well
that
while
we
decide
that
certain
conduct
is
sufficiently
reprehensible
that
it
must
be
subject
to
standards
adopted
by
the
legislature
and
punishments
adopted
by
the
legislature,
in
the
area
of
punitive
damages
without
the
benefit
of
legislative
standards
and
without
the
benefit
of
clear
standards
with
respect
to
the
amount
of
the
award,
the
punitive
damages,
and
for
less
reprehensible
conduct,
at
least
inferentially
because
the
legislature
hasn't
decided
to
punish
that
conduct,
the
awards
themselves
are
much
higher
and
we
award
punitive
damages
without
any
of
the
protections
which
we
afford
to
the
more
reprehensible
crimes
that
we
treat
in
our
courts.
the
fifth
characteristic...
i've
mentioned
four
that
are
generally
applicable
to
punitive
damages
across
the
board.
the
fifth
characteristic
is
that
here
there
is
peculiar
to
this
case,
although
not
necessarily
exclusive
to
this
case,
it
is
here
that
the
punitive
damages
were
awarded
for
violating
a
standard
not
created
until
four
years
after
the
conduct
which
was
being
judged
by
the
punitive
damages.
it
is
contrary
to
the
traditional
notions
of
due
process
to
punish
conduct
which
does
not
violate
a
known
standard,
and
yet
in
this
case
punitive
damages
were
awarded
for
a
standard
which
was
not
known
at
the
time
of
the
conduct
engaged
in.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that
is
correct,
with
respect
to
the
discussion
generally
of
the
characteristic
of
punitive
damages
and
discussion
of
the
quality
of
excessiveness
in
this
case,
of
course,
were.
we
are...
and
these
arguments
are
not
so
much
in
the
form
of
arguments
but
statements
of
the
characteristic
of
punitive
damages
which
have
been
accepted
and
adopted
by
this
court.
the
argument
that
we
are
making
that
they
are
governed
by
the
limitations
of
the
eighth
amendment
was
not
made
prior
to
the
petition
for
rehearing--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
think
that
that
can
be...
yes,
of
course.
i
think
that
that
footnote
in
that
exxon
case
can
be
explained
by
the
fact
that
the
preemption
issue,
which
was
the
issue
which
was
being
considered
in
connection
with
that
footnote,
was
something
which
had
not
been
briefed
and
fully
developed
in
the
record
in
the
alabama
courts
below,
so
there
is
a
separate
prudential
reason
for
this
court
not
to
consider
it.
and
we
looked
through
the
briefs
in
that
case
to
see
whether
the
litigants
had
actually
briefed
the
alabama
practice
prior
to
the
decision
in
that
case
that
generated
that
footnote,
and
we
found
that
they
had
not.
we
have
brought
to
this
court's
attention
somewhere
between
35
and
40
cases
which
establish
a
difference
in
the
alabama
practice
which
is
not
fully
reflected
in
that
footnote.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
with
respect
to--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--before
this
court,
we
certainly
are.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
haven't
addressed
that.
i
would
like
to
address
the
question
of
the
application
of
the
eighth
amendment
to
punitive
damages,
but
i
certainly--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
eighth
amendment
question,
mr.
chief
justice,--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--or
the
application
of
the
disqualification?
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
except
that
i
think
that
under
the
circumstances
here,
the
court
has
the
same
power
that
it
might
have
in
the
federal
courts.
we
think
that--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no,
that
this...
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
as
this
court
has
pointed
out,
the
justice,
the
appearance
of
justice
is
absolutely
necessary
to
justice
itself.
we
have
a
situation
here
which
regrettably
involves
conduct
which
is
far
beyond
the
standards
that
this
court
can
tolerate,
and
due
process
requires
a
fair
hearing
before
a
fair
tribunal.
appellant
in
this
case
did
not
have
a
fair
hearing
before
a
fair
tribunal
because
one
of
the
justices
in
the
tribunal
which
judged
him,
in
fact
a
very
influential
justice
because
he
was
the
one
that
wrote
the
court's
opinion
below,
and
it
was
a
five
to
four
opinion,
was
at
the
same
time,
this
case
was
under
submission
before
the
court
and
being
argued
before
the
court,
bringing
his
own
personal
action
for
bad
faith
punitive
damages
against
another...
a
group
insurance
company
in
alabama.
furthermore,
he
was
a
fiduciary,
it
was
a
class
action.
he
was
bringing
that
action
on
behalf
of
all
public
employees
covered
by
the
blue
cross
program
in
alabama,
and
in
fact,
as
it
turns
out,
as
we
suspected,
we
don't
know
all
of
the
facts;
we
presume
that
the
other
justices
in
the
alabama
supreme
court
were
members
of
the
putative
class.
all
we
know
is
that
two
members,
including
the
chief
justice
of
the
alabama
supreme
court,
as
soon
as
this
fact
was
brought
to
its
attention,
the
chief
justice
of
the
alabama
supreme
court
and
one
other
justice
immediately
indicated
that
they
would
withdraw
from
the
putative
class.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes.
the
constitutional
principle
that
a
litigant
is
entitled
to
a
fair
hearing
in
a
fair
tribunal,
that
the
appearance
of
justice
is
essential
to
the
provision
of
justice
itself.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
he
had
a
direct
interest
in
another
case
in
which
the
same
legal
issues
were
being
raised,
for
one.
number
two,
he
was
bringing
a
class
action
based
upon
the
same
cause
of
action
in
the
alabama
courts
where
he
was
representing
other
public
employees,
including--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
particular...
well,
i
don't
know
whether
i
would
go
quite
that
far,
justice
rehnquist,
but
this--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--this
was
a
case
involving
important
and
new
and
obviously
hotly
contested
legal
issues
in
the
alabama
supreme
court.
the
prior...
the
highest
prior
affirmed
judgment
in
a
bad
faith
insurance
context
case
in
alabama
was
$100,000.
this
case
changed
the
stakes
in
alabama
by
a
factor
of
35
times.
he
was
not
just
a
litigant;
he
was
a
class
action
litigant.
he
was
representing
all
public
employees
of
the
state
of
alabama,
including
his
colleagues
on
the
court.
he
had
direct
stake
in
the
legal
issues
that
were
being
decided
by
the
alabama
court,
and
the
amount
of
the
judgment
which
he
was
affirming,
plus,
as
indicted
by,
his
deposition...
and
you
can't,
cannot
read
his
deposition,
i
submit,
without
seeing
an
overwhelming
sense
of
hostility
and
bad...
bias
towards
insurance
companies
and
bad
faith--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
he
filed
two
bad
faith
actions
in...
while
the
lavoie
case
was
pending
before
him,
he
field
two
actions,
one
of
which
was
a
class
action.
he
had
indicated
in
his
deposition
that
several
other
times
he
had
considered
or
threatened
suing
insurance
companies,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
irrespective
of
your...
you
may
read
that
deposition
differently
than
i
do.
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
very
clear
that
he
had
very
strong
feelings
about
insurance
companies,
but
even
if
he
didn't,
even
read
another
way--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no,
i
think
that
they
were...
i
would
not
go
that
far,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
these
opinions
were
much
more
clearly
focused
on
bad
faith
claims,
punitive
damages--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--absolutely,
justice
brennan.
his
decision
in
this--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it
was
jefferson--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it
was
jefferson
county
where
his
class--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
believe
it
did,
i
believe
it
did.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
oh,
yes
it
did.
this
is
a
very
unfortunate
situation
because,
as
i
say,
the
decision
in
this
case
affirmed,
a
$3.5
million
punitive
damage
judgment.
the
highest
previous
award
had
been
$100,000.
that
does,
if...
for
anyone
who
has
handled
class
action
cases,
it
changes
the
takes
enormously.
furthermore,
the
complaint
in
his
blue
cross
case
was...
involved
the
same
issue
of
whether
partial
payment
would
be
a
defense,
which
was
a
hotly
contested
issue
in
the
alabama
supreme
court
in
the
lavoie
case.
it
also
involved
questions
of
delays
in
payment
and
whether
that
alone
would
cause...
create
bad
faith.
the
due
process
standard--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the...
yes
and
no.
the
issues
that
divided
the
court
both
covered
that
and
didn't
cover...
did
not
cover
that.
the
issues
are
somewhat
refined,
and
it's
very
difficult
to
extract
that
since
they
weren't
focusing
on
specifically
tvin,
it
in
with
his
case.
i
submit
that
the
test
has
been,
as
articulated
by
justice
black
in
the
murchison
case,
whether
the
appearance
of
justice
is
being
served,
and
that
is
what
we
have
to
talk
about
in
connection
with
the
due
process
issue,
and
the
test
there
is
whether
an
objective
person,
aware
of
all
the
facts,
would
have
legitimate
doubts,
serious
doubts,
significant
doubts
about
whether
or
not
the
litigant
before
that
tribunal
would
have
a
fair
hearing.
i
submit
that
there
really
can't
be
any
doubt
in
this
case.
i
would
like
to
return
to
the
issue
of
the
eighth
amendment.
it
is
not
an
issue
that
has
been--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
appropriate
relief
would
be
to
remand
this
case
to
the
alabama
court
system
with
an
instruct--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it
would
have
to
go
back
to
the
alabama
supreme
court,
i
submit.
there
is
a
statute
in
alabama
which
would
allow
the
governor
to
replace
members
of
the
alabama
supreme
court,
and
it
is
a
statute
which
has
been
used
before,
justice
stevens,
to
replace...
when
there's
been
disqualifications,
the
statute
specifically
refers
to
the
question
of
disqualification
to
allow
the
governor
to
replace
members
of
the
alabama
supreme
court,
to
bring
the
number
up
to
seven.
we
are
challenging
not
just
justice
embry,
who
is
not
any
longer
a
member
of
the
alabama
supreme
court,
but
the
other
justices
who
did
not
do
what
the
alabama
chief
justice
did
while
the
case
was
pending
before
them,
and
when
they
found
out
that
they
were
apparently
members
of
a
class,
did
not
act
to
withdraw
themselves
from
the
class.
while
they
went
on
to
decide
the
issues
in
this
case,
we
think
that
the
due
process
issue
requires
a
court
which
is
not
so
stigmatized.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
it
wasn't...
there
was
not
district
court
judgment...
well,
there
was
a
trial
court
judgment.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no,
i
think
that
alabama
law
entitles
these
litigants
to
an
appeal,
and--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
alabama
law
entitles--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i'm
not
sure
that
i
can
answer
that,
but
the
state
law
does
provide
an
avenue
for
appeal.
the
appeal
process
which
afforded
to
the
appellant
was
tainted
here.
the
appeal
process
is
still
available,
and
there
is
a
statute
which
would
allow
the
court
to
be
recomposed
in
a
way
which
would
not
have
the
problems
presented
by
the
due
process
clause
as
they
exist
today.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
you
can
remand
the
case
to
the
alabama
supreme
court--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
we
feel
very
strongly
that
the
court
should
go
on
and
decide
the
other
constitutional
issues
which
are
here
and
are
properly
before
the
court.
the
eighth
amendment
issue
particularly
is
extremely
important.
we
have
demonstrated
in
our
briefs
that
punitive
damages--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--we
believe
that
in
this...
in
this
circumstance,
as
we
discussed
at
some
length
in
our
brief,
this
is
an
appropriate
case
in
which
to
do
that,
particularly--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--there's
a,
there's
a,
there's
an
appropriate,
there's
an
appeal
because
the
tribunal
which
the
appellant
was
before
did
not
provide
the
appellant
with
the
proper
due
process
to
which
the
appellant
is
entitled,
and
therefore,
the
decision
of
that
court
must
be
reversed.
i
do
not
think
that
means
that
the
other
issues
that
come
with
the
appeal
are...
all
of
a
sudden
disappear.
they
are
appropriately
here
before
this
court.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
those
are...
these
are--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i...
we
concur
with
that.
on
the
other
hand,
these
are
appropriate
issues,
and
the
prudential
considerations?
which--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it
was...
it
was
extremely
important,
of
course,
justice
white,
for
us
to
present
all
of
these
issues
to
this
court
because
they
all
involved
a
denial
to
this,
especially
in
the
cumulative
effect,
a
denial
to
this
appellant
over
not
fair
opportunity
not
only
to
be
heard
by
the
court,
but
the
substantive,
denial
of
federal
constitutional
rights
in
connection
with
the
eighth
amendment
area
and
the
contract
clause
area
particularly.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no,
you
didn't.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
there
is
no
evidence.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
only...
we
can
only
draw
inference
from
the
fact
that
we
brought
this
issue
to
the
attention
of
the
alabama
supreme
court--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--after
the
initial
opinion
because--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--my
client,
the
appellant,
didn't
know
it
either.
when
we
did
bring
that
to
the
alabama
supreme
court's
attention,
two
of
the
justices
in
the
opinion
which
is
before
you
indicated
an
intention
to
withdraw
from
justice
embry's
class.
the
other
six
justices
did
not.
i
do
not
know...
i
would
think
it
would
be
unfair
to
draw
any
inferences.
i
think
that
some
factual
investigation
would
have
to
be
undertaken.
we
pointed
out
in
our
briefs
that
the
language
of
the
eighth
amendment
does
not
preclude
its
application
in
a
case
such
as
this.
this
court
has
itself
referred
many
times,
as
i
have
stated,
to
punitive
damages
as
private
fines.
the
legislative
history,
as
we
pointed
out,
indicates
that
the
eighth
amendment
was
discussed
and
debated
immediately
after
the
fifth
amendment
where
concern
over
the
possible
application
of
the
self-incrimination
provision
of
the
fifth
amendment
was
raised
and
in
order
to
limit
it
to
criminal
cases,
the
word
"criminal"
was
put
in
the
fifth
amendment
for
that
purpose.
we
have
demonstrated,
because
of
the
underlying
purposes
of
punitive
damages,
that
by
any
purposive
analysis,
the
eighth
amendment
ought
to
apply
to
punitive
damages,
and
we
have
demonstrated
historically
that
under...
there
is
almost
a
direct
lineal
tracing
of
the
eighth
amendment
excessive
fine
clause
back
to
magna
carta,
the
english
bill
of
rights,
the
virginia
declaration
of
rights,
and
that
plackstone
in
his
discussion
of
these...
of
punitive
double
and
treble
damage
cases
talked
about
both
the
civil
fines
and
the
criminal
fines
in
similar
contexts.
i
think
it
is
important
to
me,
before
i
stop,
to
discuss
what
we
think
is
an
important
consideration,
what
standard
the
court
would
have
to
apply
in
terms
of
determining
proportion...
what
was
excessive.
the
eighth
amendment
speaks
in
terms
of
excessive
fines.
that
word,
as
this
court
has
suggested,
and
i
think
is
obvious,
connotes
proportionality,
particularly
when
we
are
talking
about
the
excessive
fine
provision
as
opposed
to
the
language
used
in
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
provision,
the
word
excessive
obviously
connotes
proportionality.
we
submit,
and
as
i
mentioned
before,
the
eighth
courts
have
considered
this,
that
there
must
be...
our
whole
entire
criminal
system
is
based
upon
the
supposition
that
the
punishment
must
fit
the
crime.
that
which
we
use
to
punish
must
be
in
some
way
proportional
to
the
damage
which
is
done.
so
it
is
a
fundamental
consideration
that
in
determining
what
is
excessive,
that
the
amount
of
the
damage
be
done,
be
considered.
the
common
law
and
legislative
standards
of
treble
damages
and
double
damages
is
of
long
standing.
here
we
have
something
that
is
700
times
greater
than
treble
damages.
we
submit
that
is
completely
out
of
proportion.
to
the
extent
that
it
is
appropriate,
as
we
think
it
is,
in
determining
what
might
be
excessive,
to
look
at
the
criminal
law...
criminal
law
analogue
in
alabama
or
in
other
states,
if
there
is
no
analogue
in
alabama,
the
punishment
for
the
conduct
here
would
have
been
$3000.
and
finally,
and
most
importantly,
in
1981,
in
the
same
year
that
the
alabama
supreme
court
was
recognizing
the
bad
faith
punitive
damage
cause
of
action,
the
alabama
legislature
itself
passed
a
statute
which
is
mentioned
in
our
briefs
and
discussed
which
recognizes
the
right
of
an
individual
to
recover
against
an
insurance
company
one
and
one
half
percent
per
month
for
failure
to
pay
an
insurance
claim.
those
three
standards,
double
and
treble
damages
under
the
common
law
and
under
legislative
in
alabama
and
elsewhere,
the
criminal
law
analogue,
and
the
actual
alabama
legislative
judgment
in
this
case
that
one
and
one
half
per
month
is
an
appropriate
penalty
we
submit
is
a
paper
standard
for
excessiveness.
if
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
just
a
couple
of
brief
points,
if
i
have
the
time,
if
it
please
the
court.
in
the
first
place,
mr.
goodman
suggested
that
the
jury
was
instructed
differently
than
the
jury
was
instructed.
the
instructions
on
punitive
damages
begin
on
r-588
and
go
over
to
r-599.
there
is
an
instruction
available
in
alabama
for
compensatory
damages,
aggravation,
humiliation,
whatever
it
might
have
been.
this
jury
was
instructed
that
punitive
damages
were
for
the
purpose
of
punishment
and
deterrence.
that
was
the
instruction
given
the
appellant.
justice
embry
called
these
punitive
damages.
he
refers
to
the
amount
of
$3.5
million
as
punitive
damages,
not
compensatory
damages,
in
the
first
page
of
his
opinion
for
the
court.
the
appellees
in
their
brief
refer
on
the
very
first
page
of
their
brief
to
$1650
in
compensatory
damages
and
$3.
5
million
in
punitive
damages.
so
there
should
not
be
any
question
with
respect
to
whether
this
is
a
punitive
damage
award.
it
is
a
punitive
damage
award.
as
this
court
has
noted,
and
as
even
reflected
in
the
justice
embry
opinion,
the
damages
were
for
punishment
and
deterrence
and
not
for
compensation.
with
respect
to
the
$30,000
which
was
paid
to
settle
justice
embry's
case,
it
is
in
the
record
that
we
have
provided
with
and
cited
to
this
court.
it
is
also
in
the
record
in
the
nationwide
case
v.
clay,
which
is
also
before
this
court,
that
that
check
was
given
to
justice
embry's
attorney,
and
justice
embry's
attorney
deposited
that
$30,
000
check
in
a
trustee
account
and
then
remitted
that
$30,000
to
justice
embry.
we
have
been...
it's
been
suggested
that
the
appellant
did
not
comply
with
alabama
procedure.
that
is
not
what
was
bond
by
the
alabama
courts.
the
alabama
courts,
in
response
to
the
petition
for
rehearing,
uttered
the
word
"overruled",
a
phrase
which
is
uses
when
it
has
in
fact
addressed
the
issues.
i
have
nothing
further
to
add
except
to
say
that
the
denial
of
due
process
in
his
case,
mr.
chief
justice
and
this
court,
was
rather
massive.
a
standard
was
set
after
the
conduct;
punitive
damages
in
a
higher
amount
ever,
35
times
greater
than
ever
awarded,
was
imposed
upon
conduct
which,
for
which
the
standard
was
set
retroactively.
there
was
a
tribunal
in
which
one
justice
had
a
very
strong
interest
in
the
case,
and
then
on
top
of
everything
else,
there's
a
10
percent
appeal
penalty,
a
penalty
upon
punitive
damages
in
this
case
for
having
filed
an
appeal
and
having
lost,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
no
one
could
conceivably
argue
that
this
was
a
frivolous
appeal.
thank
you.
