ms.
gootee,
what
if
the
epa
inspector
here
had
been
able
to
go
to
a
nearby
hilltop
and
just
look
over
the
fence?
do
you
think
the
statute
prohibits
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
is
it
any
different
if
they
fly
over
the
premises?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay,
so
you
have
no
objection
to
the
flying
over
and
taking
a
look,
but
to
the...
your
sole
objection
is
to
the
taking
of
the
photographs?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
object
to
any
enhancement
of
to
person's
normal
senses
in
making
an
inspection?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
about
a
case
like
the
following
of
an
automobile
by
the
use
of
a
beeper,
which
this
court
has
said
was
all
right
under
the
fourth
amendment,
and
yet
the
police
with
their
natural
senses
might
have
lost
track
of
the
vehicle
they
were
trying
to
follow?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
government
didn't
make
use
of
the
photos
in
anyway
that
constitutes
a
violation
of
laws
concerning
trade
secrets,
did
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
has
there
been
any
use
made
of
the
photos
by
the
government
at
all,
to
your
knowledge?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--mr.
horowitz,
do
you
think
the
standard
should
be
the
same
in
flying
over
an
industrial
complex
of
this
type
as
it
should
for
the
police
to
fly
over
someone's
residential
back
yard
and
take
photographs?
is
it
really
the
same
standard?
