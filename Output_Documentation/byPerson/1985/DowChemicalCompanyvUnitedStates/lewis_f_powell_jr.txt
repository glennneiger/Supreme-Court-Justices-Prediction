lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
before
you
go
on,
may
i
put
another
hypothetical
that
i
suspect
you
will
say
is
difficult.
one
reads
in
the
media
that
a
satellite
flying
100
miles,
not
20,000
feet
but
100
miles
above
the
earth
can
identify
a
tennis
ball
on
a
tennis
court.
these
satellites
are
up
there
every
day,
the
soviet
and
the
american,
and
if
these
pictures
had
been
taken
by
an
unfriendly...
at
100
miles
up,
would
that
make
any
difference?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it's
really
a
matter
of
privilege?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
ms.
gootee,
may
i
ask
you
in
that
connection,
what
would
dow
chemical
company
do
if
one
of
its
competitors,
using
a
private
aircraft,
took
the
same
pictures?
would
you
bring
a
trespass
action
against
it,
or
charge
the
competitor
with
criminal
intrusion,
entering
or
breaking
of
a
private
residence,
or
what?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
horowitz,
tell
me
if
we
can
sort
of
sharpen
the
focus
of
this
case.
my
understanding
is
that
dow
is
not
arguing
that
the
constitution
necessarily
would
forbid
an
overflight
just
to
take
a
picture
of
a
beautiful
plant.
i
understand
its
position
is
that
it
has
trade
secrets
that
cannot
be
covered
under
a
roof
because
of
the
nature
of
the
secret.
i
have
no
idea
what
that
is.
so,
if
you
would
focus
your
attention
on--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--on
a
company
protecting
a
trade
secret,
and
what...
and
when
there
is
no
other
option
but
an
overflight,
what
is
the
government's
answer
to
that?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
they
are
trade
secrets
that
cannot
be
covered
up--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
wouldn't
have
been
business
of
the
government
to
obtain
an
administrative
warrant,
would
it
really?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
wouldn't
have
been
burdensome
to
have
obtained,
as
you
did
in
barlow,
an
administrative
warrant?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
whole
area
is
very
puzzling
in
light
of
the
scientific
development.
think
about
all
the
buildings
we
now
see
that
are
made
entirely
of
glass.
i'm
glad
i
don't
live
in
one
of
them,
but
i
suppose
with
the
right
sort
of
photography
you
could
take
pictures
of
whatever
you
wanted
inside
those
buildings
if
they
were
anywhere
near
the
windows,
and
i
wonder
if
that
would
involve...
implicate
the
fourth
amendment?
i'm
not
talking
about
a
private
home.
i'm
talking
about--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
would
it
be
fair
to
say
that
they
are
interesting
in
protecting
a
trade
secret
and
they
think
the
trade
secret
would
not
be
revealed
from
someone
taking
a
photograph
from
the
hillside?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
appreciate
the
facts
can
vary
widely.
my
understanding
was
that
this
dow
facility
was
built
on
what,
a
2,000
acre
plot...
a
2,000
acre
tract
of
land?
i
don't
know
what
part
of
that
was
covered
by
the
plant,
but
the
record
indicates
that
it
would
not
have
been
feasible
to
protect
it.
i'm
not
at
all
sure
that
you're
wrong
on
the
fourth
amendment.
i
just
think
we
ought
to
stick
to
what
i
understand
the
facts
to
be,
and
that
is
that
this
company
was
trying
to
protect
a
trade
secret
that
couldn't
be
protected
if
sophisticated
equipment
was
used
by
airplanes
flying
over
it
for
the
purpose
of
detecting
the
secret.
now,
you've
got
a
pretty
good
answer,
i
think,
if
i
understand
it,
when
you
say
all
the
epa
was
interested
in
was
the
emissions
from
a
smokestack
and
whatever
else
you
took
was
incidental,
is
that
correct?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
horowitz,
what
i'm
now
going
to
ask
you
is
immaterial
to
the
case,
really,
but
you
were
talking
about
this
garden
variety
type
camera.
there
is
a
footnote
in
the
district
court
brief
that
says
the
camera
cost
$20,000.
that's
rather
special,
isn't
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
could
that
identify
a
pipe
one-half
an
inch
in
diameter?
i
have
a
35
millimeter
camera
and
i--
