what
caused
the
difference
in
degree
between
1
and
2
on
the
one
hand
and
3
on
the
other?
is
it
the
level
of
flight
of
the
airplane,
the
type
of
camera,
or--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
now
does
that
have
fourth
amendment
implications,
whether
it's
an
oblique
angle
or
a
straight
down--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--if
you're
just
talking
about
whether
or
not
they
serve
a
law
enforcement
purpose,
i
would
think
that
photographs
1
and
2
would
serve
that
purpose
better
than
photograph
3.
justice
william

is
what

going

william

rehnquist
we
had
a
couple
of
cases
a
couple
of
years
ago.
i
can't
think
of
the
name
of
them
now,
from
tennessee
involving
stouffer
where
stouffer
was
complaining
that
they
didn't
want
epa
to
contract
out
an
inspection
because
they
thought
there
was
a
danger
of
losing
some
of
their
trade
secrets.
so,
you
know,
was
there
any
case
of
contracting
out
here
on
the
part
of
epa,
or
was
it
all
epa
employees
who
did
the--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
that's
a
little
vice
versa
from
our
usual
ruling,
is
that
