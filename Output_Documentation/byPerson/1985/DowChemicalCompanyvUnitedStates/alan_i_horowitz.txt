mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
referring
to
the
issue
that
came
up
several
times
in
petitioner's
argument
as
to
whether
epa
conducted
a
search
here,
obviously
the
ultimate
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
there
was
a
search
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment.
but,
she
has
suggested
that
we
conceded
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
there
was
a
search
here,
and
of
course
that's
true,
there
was
a
search
in
the
layman's
normal
use
of
the
term,
that
is,
epa
was
looking
for
something.
that
is
what
law
enforcement
agencies
do
all
the
time.
they
can
look
at
cars
on
the
street
to
see
if
one
matches
a
description
of
the
car
that
fled
a
robbery.
that's
a
search,
of
course,
but
it
is
not
a
search
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment.
a
search
that
is
regulated
by
the
fourth
amendment
is
one
that
invades
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy,
and
that's
what
the
ultimate
issue
in
this
case
is.
it
is
our
position
that
the
overflight
here
and
the
photography
did
not
invade
any
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
maybe
the
best
way
to
frame
the
issue
is
to
look
at
the
way
that
dow
has
chosen
to
define
its
facility.
they
have
taken
issue
with
the
government's
characterization
or
it
as
an
outdoor
plant.
on
page
4
of
their
reply
brief
they
define
it
this
way.
the
plant
here
is
a
three-dimensional
commercial
structure
which
encompasses
production
equipment
and
know-how
and
which
does
not
have
a
traditional
roof.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
if
you
would
like
me
to--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--i'd
be
happy
to
talk
about
trade
secrets
now,
if
you'd
like.
i
should
have
at
the
outset
mentioned...
i
had
understood,
certainly
when
i
did
the
brief
in
this
case,
that
the
whole
crux
of
their
claim
was
that
there
were
trade
secrets
in
the
plant,
and
we
devoted
quite
a
bit
of
attention
to
that
in
our
brief.
in
the
reply
brief
dow
says
that
our
discussion
of
trade
secrets
misses
the
point,
that
it
is
the
intrusive
surveillance
of
detail
beyond
the
purview
of
the
naked
eye
that
constitutes
the
fourth
amendment
violation.
the
fourth
amendment
violation
exists
independently
of
the
capturing
of
any
dow
trade
secrets.
so,
they
do
seem
to
take
the
position
that
whether
or
not
there
are
trade
secrets
or
not--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
let
me
assume
that
there
are
some
sort
of,
at
least
proprietary
information
there.
first
of
all,
i
think
we
would
say
that
it's
in
fact
not
a
secret,
and
the
fact
is
that
it's
exposed
to
the
view
of
anyone
who
can
fly
over,
and
there
is...
i
don't
know
there
is
any
real
law
on
the
question
of
whether
it's
a
trade
secret
under
statutes,
but
i
think
it
probably
would
be
found
not
to
be
a
trade
secret
under
the
statutes.
in
any
case,
assuming
it
is
found
to
be
a
trade
secret,
even
though
it
is
open
to
the
public,
the
fact
is
that
epa
has
not
taken
any
trade
secret.
the
trade
secret
that
they
are
discussing
in
here
is
something
that
is
revealed
through
this
extreme
magnification
of
these
photographs
that
dow
themselves
did
and
that
are
shown
to
you
in
the
sealed
joint
appendix.
epa
didn't
blow
up
these
photographs.
they
weren't
even
looking
at
the
chemical
plant
that
is
the
focus
of
this
trade
secret
claim.
they
were
looking
at
the
power
plants.
the
chemical
plant
happened
to
be
next
door
and
it
was
captured
in
the
photographs.
but,
a
trade
secret
has
been
revealed
to
the
government
in
this
case
only
in
the
sense
that
there
is
some
potentiality
for
the
government
to
actually
discover
it
by
using
examination.
that's
a
little
bit
like
the
issue
in
knotts
or
in
karo
where
the
court
found
that
the
mere
installation
of
a
beeper
was
not
a
fourth
amendment
violation.
it
wasn't
until
you
actually
monitored
it
that
you
had
transformed
the
potential
to
conduct
some
sort
of
a
search
into
actually
doing
it.
third,
i
would
say
that
all
of
the
trade
secret
legislation
which
is
basically
directed
at
unfair
competition,
not
at
the
things
that
the
fourth
amendment
is
aimed
at,
all
of
that
is
directed
at
the
unfair
use
of
the
information.
if
epa
was
planning
to
build
a
chemical
plant
and
copy
these
type
configurations
that
we
are
assuming
were
secrets,
then
there
might
be
some
basis
for
a
trade
secret
claim
here,
but
there
is
no
suggestion
that
epa
is
going
to
do
that.
they
are
using
these
pictures
for
the
purpose
of
enhancing
their
investigation
of
clean
air
act
violations,
and
the
fact
that
there's
a
trade
secret
there
is
basically,
completely
irrelevant.
it's
the
same
as
if
somebody
would
throw
a...
some
sort
of
invention
that
he
would
call
a
trade
secret
in
the
middle
of
his
marijuana
field
and
then
claims
that
the
government
can't
fly
over
his
field
and
take
a
picture
of
it
because
they're
capturing
a
trade
secret
on
the
picture.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
i
think
the
claim
is
probably...
i'm
not
sure
i
would
agree
with
it,
but
i
think
it's
probably
more
of
a
taking
claim
than
anything
else,
and
there
was
a
fifth
amendment
claim
in
this
case
that
was
dismissed
without
prejudice
that
they
can
bring.
if
the
government
actually
was
going
to
use
this
information,
the
court,
i
guess,
was
considering
that
sort
of
an
issue
in
monsanto
last
year.
but
there
is
no
suggestion
of
that
here.
i
would
say
again,
though,
i
doubt
that
it
is
a
trade
secret.
now
it's
a
question
of
tort
law.
i
think
also,
more
generally,
the
reason
why
this
might
arguably
be
a
trade
secret
has
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
the
fourth
amendment.
i
mean,
there
is
a
sense
that
corporations
are
entitled
to
maintain
the
fruits
of
their
research
and
development.
they
spend
a
lot
of
money
developing
these
sources
of
secrets,
and
it
is
unfair
competition
in
a
sense
for...
or
maybe
unfair
competition
for
a
competitor
to
just
take
the
fruits
of
their
labor
and
then
use
it
without
infusing
the
same
amount
of
funds.
now,
that
principle
is
limited
by
what
the
competitor
or
the...
excuse
me,
the
inventor
of
the
trade
secret
is
required
to
disclose
to
the
public,
because
it
is
a
clear,
recognized
principle
of
trade
secret
law
that
if
you've
developed
something
and
put
it
into
a
product
and
it's
a
secret
at
that
time,
that
if
a
competitor
can
figure
out
through
what
is
called
reverse
engineering,
by
dissecting
a
product
that
is
found
on
the
market,
figuring
out
how
it
was
made
and
basically
acquire
all
the
information
that
you've
developed
through
your
research,
that
is
not
a
violation
of
trade
secret
statutes.
so,
again,
i
am
not
sure
there
is
really
a
secret
here.
but
the
reasons
for
having
these
kinds
of
unfair
competition
statutes
don't
have
to
do
with
the
fourth
amendment.
it's
easy
to
see
that
conduct
that
might
be
considered
unfair
competition
under
the
trade
secret
laws
would
clearly
not
be
considered
a
fourth
amendment
violation.
one
example
is
the
use
of
an
informant,
which
government
law
enforcement
agencies
do
all
the
time,
and
that's
not
considered
to
violate
the
constitution.
on
the
other
hand,
most
trade
secret
statutes
suggest
that
if
you
have
a
spy
in
another
plant
or
can
somehow
convince
an
employee
of
another
plant
to
exchange
loyalties
and
give
you
trade
secrets,
that
is
considered
unfair
competition.
i
think
another
example
is
the
christopher
case
that
was
cited,
the
fifth
circuit
case
that
was
cited
by
dow
chemical
in
its
brief.
that's
a
case
where
one
company
was
building
a
plant
and
a
competitor
flew
over
and
took
aerial
photographs
of
it
before
the
plant
was
completed,
before
they
had
a
chance
to
put
the
roof
on,
basically,
although
they
were
putting
a
roof
on
it,
kind
of
snuck
in
there,
and
the
fifth
circuit
said
that
was
dirty
pool
in
the
trade
secret
context
and
they
considered
it
unfair
competition.
even
in
that
context,
i
can't
believe
if
the
state
had
sent
a
plane
over
to
check
for
building
code
violations,
if
that
was
threatening
the
safety
of
the
employees
who
were
going
to
be
working
in
that
plant,
that
that
would
be
considered
to
violate
the
fourth
amendment.
they're
just
not
taking
trade
secrets.
they're
looking
for
other
information.
finally,
i
would
make
one
more
point
about
the
trade
secret
claim,
and
that
is
that
it
doesn't
really
address
what
the
issue
here
is
because
what
they're
claiming,
i
take
it,
is
that
the
epa
overflight
and
photography
was
some
kind
of
a
search
that
required
epa
to
get
a
warrant.
they
are
not
suggesting
that
the
government,
under
no
circumstances,
could
have
conducted
this
overflight.
but,
if
we
did
get
a
warrant
to
look
for
these
emissions,
we
would
have
exactly
the
same
pictures
of
dow's
plant
and
we
would
have
exactly
the
same
trade
secrets,
and
they
would
have
exactly
the
same
problem.
the
relief
that
they
are
seeking
here,
forcing
epa
to
get
a
warrant,
doesn't
at
all
address
this
sort
of
complaint
that
they
have.
so,
that's
sort
of
a
long
answer,
justice
powell,
but
i
think
really,
trade
secrets
have
very
little
to
do
with
this
case.
it's
really
a
red
herring.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
it
wouldn't
be
much
of
a
burden?
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
no,
you're
setting
up
a
whole
new
regime,
basically,
where
you
have
to
have
magistrates
involved
in
this
and
you
have
to
decide
what
sort
of
showing
has
to
be
made
by
the
government
in
order
to
do
it.
this
was
not
a
routine
regulatory
inspection.
it
was
one
that
was
made
in
connection
with
a
specific
investigation
of
the
plant.
i
think
they
probably
could
have
gotten
a
warrant
from
a
magistrate.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
understand.
i
think
you're
right.
i
mean,
technology
has
changed
the
world
we
live
in
to
some
extent.
i
mean,
aerial
photography
today
is
a
fact
of
life.
there
are
affidavits
in
the
record.
we
have
mentioned
some
of
them
in
our
brief.
all
sorts
of
government
agencies
use
aerial
photography
all
the
time,
for
mapping,
geological
purposes.
and
it's
not
just
government
agencies.
if
you
go
to
a
real
estate
office
you'll
find
that
they
like
to
take
aerial
photographs
of
real
estate
subdivisions
so
they
can
show
people
where
houses
are
located
and
what
things
look
like.
people
are
being
photographed
all
the
time,
and
dow
knows
that.
this
is
not
a
case
where
they
really
had
an
expectation
that
they
would
not
be
photographed
from
the
air.
they
said
several
times
in
their
brief
that
they
had
this
whole,
elaborate
system
for
looking
for
planes
flying
overhead
so
they
could
try
to
figure
out
who
was
photographing
them,
and
i
guess
try
to
take
some
steps
to
discourage
them
from
doing
it
or
to
keep
track
of
whether
photography
was
being
used.
it
can't
seriously
be
contended
that
they
had
a
subjective
expectation
of
privacy,
that
they
weren't
going
to
be
photographed
from
the
air
here.
news
cameras
are
photographing
them.
in
fact,
there's
this
business
week
article
that's
referenced
in
their
brief
where
they...
i
think
about
six
weeks
ago,
from
october,
where
they
mention
that
that's
a
photograph
that
they
supplied
to
business
week.
actually,
i
spoke
to
the
reporter
from
business
week
because
i
was
curious
where
she
had
gotten
the
photograph
and
she
told
me
that
they
didn't
really
like
the
photograph
that
dow
had
given
them
and
they've
gone
ahead
and
taken
their
own.
there's
just
nothing
to
keep
people
from
doing
it.
what
dow's
position
is--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--if
anything,
i
think
it's
a
lesser
standard.
there
may
be
more
of
an
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
back
yard.
the
companion
case
to
this
one
will
be
coming
up
next,
where
it's
undisputed
that
that
was
within
the
privilege
of
the
home,
where
the
overflight
and
the
photographing
took
place.
here
we
had
a
footnote
in
our
brief,
discussing
whether
this
qualifies
as
privilege
or
not.
i
think
there's
an
argument
that
it's
not
privilege
at
all
here,
but
we've
been
willing
to
assume
for
purposes
of
this
case
that
it
can
be
treated
the
same
because
we
feel
there
is
no
expectation
of
privacy
in
any
of
them.
basically,
what
dow's
position
is,
is
that
they
have
their
property,
they've
built
things
on
their
property
and
they
don't
want
people
to
take
pictures
of
them.
i
understand
that
position
from
a
layman's
perspective.
i
have
some
sympathy
for
it.
i
feel
the
same
way
sometimes.
i
have
a
back
yard
and
neighbors
can
see
into
my
back
yard
and
occasionally
things
happen
in
my
back
yard
that
i
say
to
myself,
gee,
i
hope
the
neighbors
aren't
watching.
that's
a
hope,
but
i
don't
have
any
expectation
that
they're
not
watching
and
i
don't
expect
the
fourth
amendment
to
keep
them
from
watching.
i
mean,
what
dow
has
done
here
is,
they
have
built
a
facility
and
they
have
put
a
fence
around
it.
we
don't
dispute
that,
and
it's
very
hard
to
get
in
on
the
ground,
and
they
haven't
built
a
roof,
and
they
want
the
fourth
amendment
to
build
a
roof
for
them.
they
want
a
very
special
roof.
they
want
one
that
lets
in
the
rain,
lets
in
the
snow,
lets
in
news
photographers,
apparently
lets
in
people
who
are
just
flying
over
and
looking
down,
maybe
lets
in
people
who
are
taking
pictures
from
higher
altitudes,
but
it
doesn't
let
epa
take
photographs
that
are
relevant
to
its
enforcement
of
the
clean
air
act.
and,
there's
no
reason
why
the
fourth
amendment
should
do
that.
they
can't
build
a
roof,
they
say,
and
from
that
they
draw
the
conclusion
that
the
fourth
amendment
should
provide
a
roof
for
them.
from
that,
we
draw
the
conclusion
that
what
they
have
in
there
is
just
rot
private
and
they
can't
expect
to
keep
it
private,
and
they
certainly
can't
expect
the
fourth
amendment
to
keep
it
private.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
i
think
there
are
two
different
aspects
here
that
come
out
of
katz,
and
one
is
whether
there
is
an
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
sense
that
you
can
expect
that
what
you
have
in
there
can't
be
seen
from
the
outside,
and
then
there's
a
second
aspect,
which
is
whether
what
you're
seeking
to
protect
is
really
something
private.
that's
at
the
core
of
what
the
fourth
amendment
is
trying
to
protect.
in
this
case
dow
flunks
on
both
counts,
i
think.
i
think
there
is
no
subjective
expectation
of
privacy.
anyone
could
take
these
photographs.
they
concede
that.
secondly,
there's
really
nothing
in
there
that
was
very
private.
i
mean,
this
is
just
an
outdoor
place,
except
for
the
trade
secrets
which
i've
talked
about
at
length
already.
there's
no
reason
why
one
would
expect
the
fourth
amendment
to
inhibit
law
enforcement
in
this
way
because
there's
nothing
to
protect.
now,
there
are
harder
cases
where
these
two
different
prongs
are
somewhat
in
conflict,
and
you
have
raised
one.
i
think
where
you've
got
a
glass
building
it
may
be
hard
to
argue
that
you've
got
a
subjective
expectation
of
privacy.
you
may
well
know
that
someone
can
fly
over
and
take
photographs
through
the
glass,
if
that's
possible,
i
don't
know,
and
that
will
reveal
things.
on
the
other
hand,
what
you
do
have
in
an
office
building,
and
even
more
so
in
a
home,
is
something
that
we
have
recognized
as
being
more
private,
and
it
may
be
that
the
rule
should
be
more
stringent
there
when
you're
trying
to
protect
something
of
that
privacy.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
no,
what
i
have
said
is,
they
have
taken
steps
to
keep
people
out.
i'm
not
suggesting
that...
i
don't
know
whether
the
fourth
amendment
would
keep
people
from
going
in
there
or
not.
i
mean,
that's
the
question
of
whether
this
is
an
open
field
or
not,
and
we
don't
think
it
really
matters
in
this
case
so
we
haven't
addressed
it.
i
don't
know
whether--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
i
don't
know
that
comparing
it
to
commercial
air
flights
is
very
relevant.
i
mean,
it's
just
a
number
of
people
who
come
over
and
take
photographs
that's
relevant,
and
we
have
statistics
that
the
faa
says
more
than
a
million
flight-hours
a
year
are
devoted
to
aerial
photography.
i
don't
think,
in
this
context,
that
they
really
have
an
expectation
that
people
won't
fly
over
and
as
i
said,
i
think
that's
reflected
in
the
fact
that
they
take
such
measures
to
stare
at
the
sky
and
see
whether
people
are
flying
over.
what
i
understand
your
question
to
be,
i
think
it's
just
more
hypothetical
than
actually
applicable
to
this
case,
is
if
you
were
really
in
a
position
where
there
was
not
reason
to
think
that
you
would
ever
be
observed
unless
somebody
was
deliberately
trying
to
do
it,
i
think
that
presents
more
difficult
questions
of
expectation
of
privacy
and
i
think
that
the
resolution
of
it
might
well
depend
on
what
sort
of
place
it
was,
how
private.
if
it
was
a
home
and
the
question
was
whether
somebody
could
see
with
binoculars
from
a
quarter-mile
away,
you
might
have
a
stronger
case.
if
it's
outside
activity,
i'm
not
sure
that
the
fourth
amendment
really
should
be
preventing
government
action
in
that
way.
there
just
isn't
anything
really
important,
to
protect.
as
the
court,
i
think,
suggested
in
the
opening
argument
here,
i
have
also
had
some
difficulty
in
figuring
out
exactly
what
the
legal
principle
is
that
dow
relies
on.
as
i
said,
it
seems
to
be
pretty
much
that
they
don't
want
the
government
to
be
able
to
photograph
what
they
don't
want
the
government
to
be
able
to
photograph.
in
their
case,
they
don't
mind
oblique
photography
so
they
don't
consider
that
to
be
a
fourth
amendment
violation,
standing
on
a
nearby
hillside.
but
i
think
the
court
needs
to
have
more
of
a
rule
than
that
because
next
week
there
may
be
someone
here
who
doesn't
like
oblique
photography.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
agree.
i
think
that's
what
they're
saying,
justice
powell.
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
next
week
union
carbide
might
be
here
and
they
may
say
that
their
trade
secrets
are
revealed
by
photographs
taken
from
a
hillside.
so,
i
think
the
court--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
that's
certainly
one
of
our
answers.
i
also
dispute
whether
it's
a
trade
secret.
but
i'm
a
little
bit
unwilling
to
concede
that
they're
really
interested
in
protecting
trade
secrets
because
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
course
of
the
litigation
here.
i
mean,
they
found
out
that
epa
had
taken
these
pictures
and
they
ran
into
court,
they
got
an
injunction
from
the
district
court
that
prevents
any
use
of
the
pictures
and
any
future
overflights,
i
think
surveillance
or
photography
by
epa,
but
i
guess
they
really
conceded
away
in
this
court
part
of
what
they
won
in
the
district
court.
if
they
were
worried
about
trade
secrets,
all
they
had
to
do
was
talk
to
the
epa
and
say,
look,
we're
really
worried
about
these
trade
secrets.
here,
you
use
these
pictures
for
your
enforcement
action
but
we
want
you
to
keep
them
under
seal
and
we
only
want
you
to
give
them
back
to
us
when
you're
done
with
the
enforcement
action
and
don't
blow
them
up
because
that's
going
to
reveal
trade
secrets.
after
all,
there's
no
trade
secrets,
as
i
said
before,
on
anything
that
epa
has,
other
than
just
potential
to
blow
them
up.
so,
i
think
they
are
at
least
partly
concerned
about
epa
flying
over
and
finding
out
what
epa
wants
to
know,
and
not
just
about
trade
secrets.
it
seems
to
me--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--the
pictures
were
taken
by
a
local
photography
concern
and
they
were
immediately...
negatives
were
put
into
a
parcel
and
air
freighted
to
epa,
and
since
that
time
i
think
it's
been
under
control
of
epa.
i
don't
think
there's
any
issue
like
that
here.
as
i
said,
i
found
it
hard
to
discern
a
rule
from
the
contentions
that
dow
is
making.
i
think
the
only
line
that
can
be
drawn
from
what
they
are
saying
is
one,
the
court
was
suggesting
in
the
argument,
which
is
that
naked
eye
observation
is
okay
but
once
you
pull
out
a
camera
you're
violating
the
fourth
amendment.
i
just
don't
think
that
rule
can
stand
in
light
of
what
the
court
has
said.
the
court
has
always
recognized
that
technology
can
be
used
to
enhance
the
senses,
said
it
recently
in
knotts,
and
doing
all
the
way
back
to
the
lee
case
in
the
1920's.
that's
two
on
the
ground,
and
there's
no
reason
why
it
shouldn't
be
equally
true
from
the
air.
the
point
is
whether
there
is
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
that
is
being
infringed.
if
the
government
uses
some
sort
of
space
age
technology
that's
only
available
to
the
pentagon
or
the
military,
then
a
person
on
the
ground
probably
has
a
right
to
assume
that
he's
going
to
be
free
from
that
kind
of
surveillance,
and
surveillance
of
that
type
probably
does
violate
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
if
epa
is
going
nothing
more
than
taking
the
same
photographs
that
everyone
else
is
taking,
and
here
again
i'll
repeat
that
all
they
did
was
hire
this
local
concern
and
told
them
to
take
a
picture
with
their
equipment,
and
the
idea
that
we
used
sophisticated
equipment...
it's
certainly
more
sophisticated
than
a
kodak
instamatic
but
it
was
basically
just
regular
old
aerial
photography
cameras.
there's
just
no
expectation
to
be
free
from
the
use
of
that
sort
of
fairly
minor
technology.
it's
just--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
i
think
a
sort
of
answer
to
that
is
that
as
long
as
you're
going
to
have
a
standard
where
it
depends
on
people's
expectations,
it's
inevitable
that
those
expectations
may
change
with
the
development
of
technology.
i
mean,
if
this
case
had
come
up
in
1900,
they
could
have
had
an
expectation
that
these
pictures
couldn't
have
been
taken
and
in
fact
they
couldn't
have
been
taken.
but,
it
doesn't...
i
don't
think
it
means
that
as
technology
increases
people
will
continue
to
lose
more
and
more
of
their
privacy.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
understand.
that's
why
i
said
earlier
that
there
are
these
two
prongs
to
katz,
and
i
think
just
saying
that
if
people
have
an
expectation
that
they
may
be
subject
to
certain
intrusion
does
not
necessarily...
is
not
a
complete
answer
because
everybody
is
familiar
with
1984
where
the
government
put
cameras
in
everyone's
house
and
that
would
clearly
violate
the
fourth
amendment
even
if
they
announced
it
on
tv
for
weeks
beforehand
and
everyone
knew
about
it.
so,
the
fourth
amendment
does
go
beyond
what
people
have...
it
does
give
an
additional
protection
beyond
what
the
government
is
willing
to
confer.
but
in
a
context
like
this
where
there
is,
i
still
say,
very
little
private
interest
that's
actually
involved
and
plus
the
aura
that
what
dow
is
seeking
basically
to
do
is
to
prevent
the
government
from
doing
what
everyone
else
can
do.
this
is
information
that
is
open
to
the
public,
and
to
the
extent
that
trade
secret
law
is
a
limitation
on
that,
that's
something
that
has
to
be
litigated
in
a
separate
trade
secret
action
where
the
issue
would
tend
to
focus
on
what
sort
of
use
is
being
made
of
it.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
it
is
special,
but
it
is
not
special
for
aerial
photographers,
is
what
i'm
trying
to
say.
in
fact,
we
have
cited
to
an
affidavit
which
stresses
that
the
same
level
of
detail
could
have
been
taken
with
a
35
millimeter
camera
that
most
people
have.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
the
finding
of
the
district
court,
we
have
a
footnote
in
our
brief
about
the
dimensions
here.
the
scale
in
the
photographs
that
were
taken
by
epa
was
on
a
scale
of
one
inch
equals
one
forty-eight
hundredth
of
an
inch,
i
believe.
i
mean,
these
pictures
are
not
that
detailed.
i
mean,
dow
seems
to
have
access
to
some
very
sophisticated
magnification
and
enlargement
equipment
and
that's
what
they
said,
and
they
keep
enlarging
these
things
and
that's
what
the
district
court
found,
they
can
see
up
to
a
half
an
inch
diameter.
i'm
not
sure
i
believe
that
but
if
that's
the
case
i
think
the
same
thing
could
have
been
done
with
the
35-millimeter
camera.
it's
obviously
not
the
sort
of
camera
that
everybody
has
in
their
back
yard
but
this
is
a
regular...
this
is
basically
the
commercially
available
equipment,
it's
the
routine
aerial
photography
equipment,
the
same
thing
that
business
week
and
the
real
estate
developers
are
using.
there's
no
aura
here
of
the
government
bringing
in
its
space
age
technology.
let
me
just
say
something
here
very
briefly
about
the
statute.
i
think
the
statutory
argument
borders
on
the
frivolous
here.
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
that
suggests
that
epa
couldn't
do
this.
the
argument
seems
to
assume
that
the
photography
here
was
constitutionally
offensive.
if
it
was,
of
course,
then
you
don't
have
to
get
to
the
statutory
argument
but
assuming
that
the
photography--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--i
understand,
but
i
mean...
i'm
saying
that
the
statutory
argument
there
is
subsumed
in
the
constitutional
argument
but
i
think
the
statutory
argument
has
to
rest
on
the
assumption
that
the
photography
was
in
fact
constitutional,
which
we
believe
it
was.
in
their
reply
brief
they
suggest
that
perhaps
the
statute
doesn't
authorize
it
because
epa
is
not
a
law
enforcement
agency.
i
don't
understand
why
epa
is
not
a
law
enforcement
agency.
the
clean
air
act
is
a
law,
i
think,
and
the
government
is
entitled
to
enforce
it,
and
they
are
entitled
to
use
the
same
sort
of
methods
of
investigation
that
private
investigators
are
entitled
to
use.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
hate
for
the
last
question
to
be
one
that
i
cant's
answer,
justice
stevens,
but
i
don't
know.
thank
you.
