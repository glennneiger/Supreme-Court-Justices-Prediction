justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
the
question
in
the
case,
whether
it
had
such
a
duty?
you
said
it
ignored
this
duty,
but
isn't
that
the
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt,
just
to
follow
up
on
justice
powell's
question.
you
said
it
doesn't
matter
if
it's
1,000
feet
or
100
miles.
what
if
it's
100
feet?
what
if
it's
a
helicopter?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
the
helicopters
are
not
bound
by
the
1,000
foot
regulation.
that
doesn't
apply.
it
applies
to
fixed
wing
aircraft.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
your
view
that
even
if
you
descend
low
enough
so
that
you
see
with
the
naked
eye
and
see
the
same
half-inch
pipes?
would
that
be
a
violation?
and
if
so,
why?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
just
directing
it
at
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
makes
it
so
obvious?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no.
i
am
suggesting
no
technology,
the
naked
eye.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
oh.
so
is
an
automobile.
i
thought
you
said
planes
were
like
automobiles?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
really
have
some
difficulty.
you
cannot
look
from
helicopters
at
a
low
altitude?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
cannot
constitutionally?
the
police
are
constitutionally
disabled
from
flying
around
in
helicopters
at
low
altitude?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
because
a
helicopter
is
a
sophisticated
device,
is
that
it,
just
as
though
it
were
a
high-powered
telescope?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
catching
speeders
by
following
them
with
a
helicopter?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
couple
of
questions.
supposing
the
problem
were
either
emissions
from
a
stack
or
water
or
some
chemical
being
discharged
eventually
into
water
pollution,
and
if
you
couldn't
see
it
except
by
flying
over
the
plant,
but
if
you
do
fly
over
the
plant
you
could
see
a
discoloration
of
water
or
maybe
some
smoke
coming
out
of
a
very
tiny
smokestack.
would
it
be
illegal
and
unconstitutional
under
your
view
for
the
government
to
fly
over
and
just
look
and
see
if
that
was
happening?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
your
plant,
with
all...
suppose
you
had
to
fly
at
a
very
low
altitude
to
do
that,
that
they
get
permission
from
the
faa
or
something
so
that
they
can
fly
low
enough
to
take
a
look.
would
it
still
be
all
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
do
you
mean
by
"extraordinary"?
justice
john
paul
stevens
forget
the
statute
for
a
minute.
i'm
just
talking
about
the
constitutional
question.
but
supposing
they
can
fly
at
1,000
feet,
then,
and
they
could
not
be
sure
with
the
naked
eye
but
they
could
take
a
picture
just
like
you
did
and
then
magnify
the
picture
and
look
at
it.
that's
bad,
you
say?
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
1,000
feet,
they
look
down
with
the
naked
eye,
they
can't
really
detect
the
coloration
of
the
water
very
well
but
they
take
a
picture
thinking
they
can
study
it,
you
know,
have
it
enlarged
and
look
at
it
more
closely
and
then
they
can
figure
out...
that's
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
shows...
it
enables
them
to
make
darned
sure
that
there's
some
discoloration
of
the
water.
what
about
smoke
coming
out
of
the
smokestack.
they
couldn't
quite
see
it
with
the
naked
eye,
it
was
a
little
foggy
or
something,
but
they
take
a
picture
and
they
study
it
and
they
find
out...
is
that
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
don't
have
any
control
over
the
air
space?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
it's
wrong
to
fly
around
in
airplanes
looking
for
emissions
that
pollute
the
air?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
what
if
the
government...
i
know
it's
not
true
in
this
case,
but
what
if
there
were
a
secret
that
the
government
was
interested
in
acquiring,
went
over
and
took
a
picture
and
then
went
ahead
and
developed
its
own
plant
to
make
whatever
the
chemical
might
be
or
something.
could
you
claim
that
was
a
seizure?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
go
back
to
justice
powell's
example.
supposing
it
were
a
glass
office
building
and
you
could
fly
over
and
you
had...
i
don't
know
if
techniques
are
this
sophisticated
or
not,
but
you
could
take
pictures
through
the
glass
walls
or
roof
that
were
sufficiently
detailed
to
read
documents
on
a
desk.
any
objection
to
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
a
little
puzzled
on
that,
on
the
dow
case.
it
seems
to
me
you've
agreed
that
they
have
a
privacy
interest
in
keeping
people
out
at
ground
level,
from
seeing
what
goes
on
within,
and
surely
there
could
be
things
that
happen
in
the
plant
that
they
would
like
to
have
the
same
degree
of
privacy--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
if
99
and
99
one-hundredths
of
the
passengers
in
airplanes,
and
pilots
who
flew
over
really
couldn't
see
anything,
it's
only
the
one
case
out
of
a
million
in
which
you
take
a
sophisticated
camera
and
take
a
picture,
would
you
say
they
have
no
expectation
that
in
general
their
privacy
would
be
respected?
isn't
that
the
fact,
that
it's
the
unusual
case
where
somebody
can
look
at
the
kind
of
stuff
they
see
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
horowitz,
you
seem
to
agree
that
if
there
were
space
age
technology
used,
it
might
be
so
unusual
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
does
that
mean
that
as
we
get
more
accustomed
to
more
sophisticated
technology,
it
would
no
longer
be
objectionable
so
that
the
constitutional
rule
will
change
as
scientific
developments
increase?
justice
john
paul
stevens
perhaps
if
that's
the
rule,
the
government
could
do
a
very
good
job
of
educating
everybody
as
to
their
great
capacity
for
sophisticated
investigation
and
people
would
realize
that
they'd
have
to
just
take
those
risks.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--let
me
ask
you
one
last
question.
what's
the
state
of
the
record,
either
supporting
or
contradicting
judge
merrit's
statement
that
the
plant
is
located
within
the
landing
pattern
of
a
nearby
airport?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
judge
merritt
just
made
that
up?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
flies
airplanes,
i
understand.
