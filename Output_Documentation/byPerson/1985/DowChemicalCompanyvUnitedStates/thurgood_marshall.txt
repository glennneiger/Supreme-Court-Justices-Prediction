ms.
gootee,
do
i
understand
you
that
if
you
can
see
into
the
plant
that's
okay,
but
if
you
take
a
picture
of
what
you
see,
that's
wrong?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
talking...
if
the
exact
same
spot
where
that
person
was
standing,
and
legally,
according
to
your
view
of
it,
he
couldn't
take
a
picture,
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
see
how
you...
i'm
standing
and
i
can
see,
and
i
point
a
camera
and
do
the
exact
same
thing,
that's
wrong?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
the
harm
is
the
camera?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
that
done
by
the
camera?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
the
technology
that
you
are
complaining
about?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
what
are
you
complaining
about?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you're
objecting
to
the
technology?
justice
thurgood
marshall
a
camera
is
not
a
gun.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
exactly
why
i
don't
understand
you.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
know
how
far
you
cooperated.
when
they
asked
to
come
in,
you
told
them
no.
