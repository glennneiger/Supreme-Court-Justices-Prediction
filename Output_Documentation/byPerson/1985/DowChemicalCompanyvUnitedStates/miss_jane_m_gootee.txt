ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
fourth
amendment
administrative
search
case
where
dow
is
asking
this
court
to
reinstate
the
district
court's
holding
that
epa's
action
both
exceeded
its
statutory
authority
under
section
114
of
the
clean
air
act,
and
that
epa's
actions
amounted
to
an
unreasonable
search
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
on
cross-motion
for
summary
judgment,
and
as
the
tryer
of
fact,
the
district
court
found
that
the
dow
facility
in
midland,
michigan
was
a
highly
secured
commercial
facility.
it
was
not
an
open
field.
the
district
court
also
found
that
epa's
action
amounted
to
a
search,
a
fact
which
the
government
admitted,
both
in
its
brief
and
its
oral
argument.
the
district
court
also
found
that
the
epa's
photographs
contained
vivid
detail
to
the
point
of
depicting
items
and
equipment
as
small
as
one-half
inch
in
diameter,
and
the
court
found
that
the
camera
saw
much
more
than
the
human
aerial
eye
or
mind
could
ever
see.
in
september
of
1977,
epa
conducted
a
three-hour
on-site
inspection
of
the
two
powerhouses
at
dow's
midland
facility.
that
was
done
in
continuing
preparation
for
clean
air
act
enforcement
action
and
to
confirm
the
epa's
suspicion
that
the
two
powerhouses
did
in
fact
violate
the
clean
air
act.
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
yes,
it
was,
justice
brennan,
and
during
that
inspection
the
epa
people
received
full
cooperation
from
dow
personnel.
they
saw
everything
they
wanted
to
see.
they
were
denied
nothing.
in
fact,
after
the
inspection,
at
epa's
request
dow
submitted
drawings
and
schematics
to
epa
depicting
the
powerhouses,
the
equipment
in
the
powerhouses,
and
the
areas
surrounding
the
powerhouses.
the
epa
enforcement
engineer
testified
that
after
that
september
inspection
he
needed
no
further
information
from
or
about
dow
to
confirm
his
suspicions
that
the
powerhouses
were
in
violation
of
the
act.
three
months
later,
in
early
december
of
1977,
dow
received
a
phone
call
from
the
epa
requesting
a
repetitive
on-site
inspection
with
a
camera.
dow
refused
that
request,
told
the
epa
it
would
not
allow
non-dow
cameras
inside
the
fence
line,
and
the
possibility
of
epa's
getting
a
warrant
was
discussed.
in
fact,
after
the
phone
call
a
dow
attorney
called
the
u.s.
attorney's
office
in
bay
city,
michigan
and
told
that
office
that
if
the
epa
approached
the
office
and
was
going
to
try
to
seek
a
warrant,
that
dow
would
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
be
there
and
be
heard.
two
months
after
that
refusal
of
the
second
on-site
inspection,
knowing
that
dow
refused
consent
for
a
second
on-site
inspection,
knowing
that
dow
objected
to
aerial
photographs,
or
the
photographs
of
its
plant,
and
knowing
of
its
duty
to
resort
to
the
court,
the
epa
ignored
dow's
constitutional
and
statutory
rights
and
ignored
its
duty
to
seek
judicial
oversight
and
acquired
surreptitiously--
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
--yes,
justice
stevens.
the
issue
is
whether
there
was
a
search.
the
epa
had
tried
to
come
on
to
that
property
to
conduct
a
search
and
had
been
turned
away
after
there
had
been
one
consensual,
voluntary
inspection.
the
district
court
found
that
there
was
a
search.
in
fact,
the
government
admitted
in
both
the
oral
argument
and
the
brief
that
it
had
conducted
a
search
in
conducting
the
fly-over.
the
district
court
also
found
that
epa's
actions
exceeded
its
statutory
inspection
authority
under
section
114.
on
appeal
by
the
government
the
sixth
circuit...
the
sixth
circuit
agreed
with
the
district
court
that
section
114
of
the
clean
air
act
does
not
explicitly
authorize
aerial
photography
as
a
site
inspection
technique,
but
the
district
court,
ignoring
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
ignoring
the
obvious
congressional
intent
of
providing
the
owners
notice,
without
citation
to
any
authority,
held
that
the
act
did
not
impliedly
forbid
aerial
photography.
dow
thinks
that--
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
--no,
we
do
not,
justice
o'connor.
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
dow
has
absolutely
no
objection
to
a
naked-eye
viewing
of
its
plant
from
anywhere
that
the
government
or
the
public
may
have
a
right
to
be.
our
objection
in
this
case
is
that...
it's
similar
to
the
karo
case.
the
epa
used
intrusive
technology,
used
technology--
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
--yes,
it
is,
and
that...
that's
both
constitutional
and
statutory.
under
the
statute
the
taking
of
pictures,
the
capturing
of
the
extreme
intrusive
detail
to
the
size
of
a
half-inch
in
diameter,
deprives
dow
of
the
notice
that
an
inspection
has
occurred
and
deprives
dow
of
the
opportunity
to
claim
confidential
business
information.
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
justice
brennan,
that's
an
interesting
hypothetical.
midland,
michigan
is
very
flat.
but
if
there
were
a
hillside
and
the
epa
could
have
apparently
legal
access
to
it
and
could
look
at
the
plant,
we
do
not
object
to
that.
we
don't
object
to
them--
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
--not
necessarily.
i
think
the
real
question
is
the
degree
of
intrusion.
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
i
think
it
depends
on
the
camera.
there
was
a
recent
case
in
california--
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
--generally
a
lateral
view
from
the
ground
is
the
view
that
dow
has
chosen
to
give.
we
know
that
people
can
drive
by
and
look
at
our
plant.
now--
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
--as
we
go
into
the
sky
at
varying
levels,
it's
going
to
depend
more
and
more
on
the
degree
of
intrusion.
i
think
it's
the
distinction--
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
--i
have
to
come
back
to
degree
of
intrusion.
we're
on
level
ground,
not
even
with
a
hilltop,
and
the
police
or
the
inspection
officials
take
a
picture
through
my
living
room
window,
which
they
can
see
just
standing
on
the
street,
and
use
a
telephoto
lens
and
get
detail
as
they
did
in
the
kim
case
to
see
what
i'm
doing
in
my
living
room,
that's
an
unconstitutional
search.
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
yes,
it
is.
it's
very
bad.
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
exactly.
we
have
no
problem
with
the
public
or
the
government
making
use
of
the
air
space.
i
think
the
fact
that
they
used
an
airplane
is
like
the
fact
that
they
can
use
a
car.
we
have
no
problem
with
people
driving
by
the
plants.
put
if
they
use
a
car
to
ram
through
our
gate
and
get
in,
we
have
a
problem
with
that.
it's
the
use.
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
no,
your
honor.
i
think
there's
some
parts
to
inspections
that
society
has
deemed
reasonable.
for
instance,
in
sampling
emissions,
obviously
something
has
to
be
used
to
capture
the
effluent
or
the
smoke
or
something
and
then
test
that.
that
is
a
use
of
technology,
but
it
is
a
use
of
technology
with
dow's
notice
and
we
can
split
samples,
we
can
run
the
same
test,
we
can
give
them
things
to
look
at,
and--
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
--except
that
i
think
the
distinguishing
factor,
as
this
court
has
held,
that
the
police
could
have
followed
it
with
their
visual
sense.
it's
only
when
that
technology
intruded
into
the
home
in
the
carroll
case
and
the
visual
senses
could
not
have
intruded
the
way
the
technology
did,
they
couldn't
have
depicted
the
critical
information
without
a
warrant
or
without
consent.
i
think
the
existing
holdings
of
this
court...
western
alfalfa
is
probably
the
best
case
in
dow's
defense--
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
--justice
powell,
again
an
excellent
hypothetical
and
one
we've
obviously
thought
about.
the
distinction
that
i
think
this
court
should
stay
away
from
is
the
spatial
relationship.
i
don't
think
it
matters
whether
it's
1,000
feet
up
or
100
miles
up.
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
it's
purpose,
and
in
this
case...
it's
mostly
military
satellites
that
have
that
capability.
that's
usually
top
secret
information.
i
think
the
civilian
satellites
have
a
resolution
of
about
ten
meters.
with
the
new
french
system,
the
spot
system
coming
in,
it
may
be
four
meters.
the
problem
here,
though,
is
that
we
have
a
governmental
administrative
agency
with
specific
statutory
authority
and
who
are
bound
by
the
constitution.
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
then
we
get
into
problems
with
the
faa
regulations.
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
i
think
that
the
question
there,
even
though
it's
not
binding
on
this
court,
has
been
answered
in
the
case
of
people
versus
sneed
in
california
where
a
helicopter
did
descend
20
feet
above
a
residential
back
yard
and
that
was
clearly
held
to
be
an
intrusion
into
the--
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
--i
think
it
would
be
an
unreasonable
violation.
we
would
still
have
the
same
statutory
problems.
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
on
the
fourth
amendment
issue,
i
think
it
would
be
obviously
an
unreasonable
intrusion
into--
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
--the
western
alfalfa
case,
and
somehow
in
karo,
they
are
using
technology
to
get--
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
--well,
the
helicopter
itself
is
technology.
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
right,
we
have
no
problem
if
they
are
used
in
the
normal
events
that
society
accepts,
but
if
they
are
used
as
a
battering
ram
or
as
an
invading
tool,
then
we
have
a
problem.
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
you
obviously
can
look.
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
i
think
that
they
would
have...
it
would
be
an
invasion
of
privacy,
just
as
in
norml
versus
mullen,
that
the
use
of
helicopters
to
go
down
and
look
at
people's
windows
and
in
their
back
yards
was
an
invasion
of
privacy.
i
don't
think
that
americans--
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
--well,
again,
i
think
i
would
draw
back
from
the
exact
technology
utilized
and
focus
in
on
the
fact
that
it's
an
unreasonable
intrusion
into
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
we
don't
expect
our
government
and
this
country
to
operate
thiat
way.
it
offends,
you
know,
the
notions
of
justice
and
fair
play.
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
well,
they
have
a
moving
car
from
whatever
height
is,
i
think,
plainly
visible
with
the
naked
eye.
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
thank
you.
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
we
have
been
discussing
various
types
of
aerial
overflights.
the
one
thing
we
did
not
make
clear
is
that
there
is...
one
of
the
distinguishing
factors
in
this
case
is
the
intrusive
aerial
photographs
taken
by
epa.
this
was
no
brief,
non-intrusive
investigation.
it
was
intrusive
and,
contrary
to
being
brief,
the
agency
if
they
had
access
to
these
photographs
captured
the
entire
details
of
dow's
facility
and
they're
still
on
paper.
they
will
be
on
paper
until
someone
destroys
these
photographs
which
are
in
fact
the
equivalent
of
good
engineering
drawings.
now,
the
sixth
circuit
agreed
with
the
district
court
that
dow
has
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
from
ground
level
intrusion,
and
then
in
an
apparent
flip-flop,
in
an
inconsistency
in
its
opinion,
the
court
held
that
from
the
air
dow
is
an
open
field,
that
it
has
no
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
i
direct
the
court's
attention
to
photograph
3
in
the
sealed
joint
appendix
which
is
a
dow
photograph
which
depicts
a
naked-eye
type
viewing
of
the
dow
facility.
the
dow
facility,
the
2,000
acre
fenced,
secured,
including
security
that
watches
for
suspicious
aircraft--
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
--photograph
3,
justice
brennan,
is
a
dow
photograph.
it's
the
type
of
photograph
that
after
our
management
has
a
chance
to
take
a
look
at
it,
that
we
in
fact
take,
our
management
looks
at
it,
says,
no
problem,
that's
the
same
as
a
naked
eye
view.
it's
the
type
of
photograph
that
we
release
to
the
press.
now,
in
contrast
to
that,
photographs
1
and
2
in
the
sealed
joint
appendix
are
two
of
the
actual
epa
photographs.
these
are
the
pictures
that
our
plant
manager
looked
at
with
a
hand-held
magnification
and
said
that
he
could
see
items
and
equipment
one-half
inch
in
diameter.
now,
photograph
2,
our
photograph
1,
the
upper
part
of
the
photograph,
it
is
easy
to
see
electrical
wires
and
their
shadows,
which
is
the
size
of
a
small
finger,
and
that
is
the
degree
of
intrusive
detail
that
epa
captured
in
these
pictures.
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
no,
justice
rehnquist,
it
is
not
the
level
of
the
flight.
they
were
taken
at
approximately
the
same
level,
about
1,200
feet.
it
is
the
angle.
the
dow
picture
is
an
oblique
angle,
which
means
that
you're
looking
at
it
from
the
side.
the
epa
picture
is
a
vertical
angle,
straight
down,
as
would
an
engineering
drawing
be,
a
straight
down
shot.
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
not
directly
in
the
fourth
amendment.
it
buttresses
dow's
position
that
the
pictures
are
intrusive,
that
they
don't
serve
a
law
enforcement
purpose,
and
that
society
would
not
recognize
them
as
reasonable
because
they
depict
our
trade
secrets.
and
if
the
dow
facility,
which
happens
to
be
an
open
field--
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
--well,
your
honor,
photographs
1
and
2,
the
epa
was
specifically
looking
for
emissions
from
the
powerhouse.
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
it's
a
law
enforcement
intent,
but
the
photographs
showed
no
plumes
from
the
powerhouse.
as
stated
on
page
31
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
photographs
showed
no
plume
and
they
were
worthless
to
the
agency
in
the
enforcement
action.
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
that's
not
the
fourth
amendment
test.
that
is
one
of
the
factors
that
shows
that
they
were
in
fact
engaged
in
a
search.
they
intended
to
get
evidence
for
use
in
an
enforcement
action.
now,
what
i
started
talking
about
a
minute
ago,
about
the
detail,
is
the
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
that
society
accepts
as
reasonable.
the
agency
thought
they
had
a
need
but
they
didn't
get
any
good
evidence.
dow
has
a
need
to
protect
its
assets,
its
confidential
business
information.
if
the
dow
facility
was
held
to
be
an
open
field,
number
one,
there
is
little
land
in
the
united
states
that
isn't,
in
that
case.
number
two,
as
this
court
recognized
in
the
kewanee
oil
case,
to
even
make
an
allegation
that
there
is
a
trade
secret
an
owner
has
to
show
that
they
have
taken
steps
to
preserve
the
secrecy.
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
justice
powell,
under
michigan
state
law,
we
have
a...
well,
we
would
swear,
you
know,
make
out
an
indictment
under
the
criminal
laws
of
michigan
for
the
taking
of
trade
secrets
by
improper
means.
we
also
have
a
civil
action
under
the
restatement
of
torts
as
recognized
in
the
dupont
versus
christopher
case
and
as
recognized
by
this
court
in
the
kewanee
oil
case.
aerial
photography
is
a
recognized
way
of
taking
trade
secrets.
now,
for
that
to
happen,
you
know,
for
the
court
to
say,
yes,
that's
the
way
to
do
it,
obviously
they
have
to
be
somehow
exposed
to
the
sky.
otherwise
it's
nonsense.
and
this
is
what
we
have
in
this
case.
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
no,
justice
o'connor,
not
that
we
know
of.
the
photographs
were
displayed
on
walls
in
epa's
chicago
offices
for
roughly
a
month,
but
the
use
of
a
trade
secret
or
confidential
business
information
is
not
required
for
fourth
amendment
violation.
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
other
than
the
fact
that
we
don't
know
what
happened
to
them
that
one
month
in
chicago,
no,
there
has
not.
they
have
been
under
seal
since
april
the
7th
of
1978.
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
yes,
justice
marshall.
from
the
road...
from
ground
level,
the
view
that
is
shown
of
the
plant
is
the
view
that
dow
has
chosen
to
show
to
the
public.
from
an
aerial
perspective--
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
--he
could
probably
take
a
picture
on
the
facts.
it
would
be
hard
to
get...
we're
talking
open
air
plants.
the
plant
is
like
a
small
city.
we
go
from--
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
--if
you
get
the
exact
same
thing,
that's
okay.
that's
our
photograph
3.
that's
our
naked
eye...
that's
a
picture
of
what
you
would
see
with
the
naked
eye.
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
no,
the
harm
is
the
degree
of
intrusion.
it's
using
technology
to
depict
critical
details
that
you
couldn't
get--
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
--in
effect,
but
cameras
only
operate
through
people.
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
we're
not
complaining
about
technology.
we're
complaining
about
the
government's
intrusion.
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
that
the
government
exploited
technology,
as
it
did
in
the
karo
case.
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
well,
this
certainly
isn't
a
case
against
aerial
photography,
just
like
a
murder
case
isn't
against
the
gun.
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
exactly.
what
we're
complaining
about,
justice
marshall--
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
--let
me
try
to
make
myself
more
clear,
then.
what
we
are...
dow's
problem
in
this
case
is
that
after
we
had
cooperated
with
the
epa,
after
we
had
taken
every
step--
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
--well,
that
was
their
second
repetitive
inspection.
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
well,
i
guess
we
take
a
different
point
of
view
because
we
had
cooperated
with
them.
they
had
a
three
hour
on-site
inspection.
this
was
in
fact
part
of
a
long
interaction
with
the
agency
on
the
power
plant
emissions,
and
maybe
to
cut
this
line
of
questioning
a
little
bit
short,
i
refer
the
court
to
the
dow
versus
epa
decision
by
the
sixth
circuit
on
the
enforcement
action
at
635
fed.
2d
559,
and
i
think
the
sixth
circuit
explains
more
the
interaction
between
dow
and
the
agency,
and
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
cooperation.
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
no,
it
would
not,
justice
stevens.
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
that
is
crossing
the
line
that
we
got
to
before
lunch.
it's...
in
our
perspective,
ordinary
overflights
are
reasonable.
extraordinary
overflights
are
not
reasonable.
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
extremely
low
level,
or
an
aircraft
hovering
low
to
the
ground,
something
that's
outside
the
ordinary
conduct
of
the
police
or
citizens.
and
that's...
you
know,
remembering
that
the
agency
is
both
bound
and
authorized--
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
--they
were
flying
at
1,000
feet?
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
yes,
it
is,
because
the
aerial
photography...
well,
that's
presuming
the
picture
shows
more
detail
than
the
human
eye
can
detect.
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
it's
unconstitutional
because
of
the
degree
of
intrusion
into
areas
that
they're
not
authorized
to
go.
it's
unreasonable.
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
no,
we
don't,
but
we
have,
under
the
fourth
amendment
we
have
control
of
the
privacies
of
our
corporate
existence,
and
that's
what
we
are
trying
to
establish
today.
the
photographs
here,
in
the
nature
of
aerial
photography,
it's
like
a
wiretap
on
a
public
phone.
you
get...
whoever
uses
the
phone.
here
they
flip
the
switch
on,
the
run
begins.
they
got
not
only
dow
chemical.
they
photographed
dow
corning,
consumers
power,
and
the
entire
city
of
midland,
and
that
strikes
me
as
a
search
of
the
type
that
was
carried
out
in
ybarra
versus
illinois
where
they
saw
a
criminal
run
into
a
bar.
they
thought
the
person
was
in
there,
so
they
frisk
everybody.
it's
just
massively
intrusive
and
repugnant.
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
no,
i
don't,
but
i
think
there
are
more
reasonable
ways
of
doing
it,
such
as
was
recognized
in
western
alfalfa
or
by
asking
the
dow
chemical
company,
under
section
114-a.
if
we're
required
to
keep
records
and
the
epa
wants
to
see
those
records,
they
can
at
any
point
in
time,
they
can
ask
us
and
we
have
no
fifth
amendment
privilege.
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
no,
we
are
not,
your
honor,
because
they
went
far
beyond
the
scope
of
the
statute.
under
section
114
they
are
limited
to
three
types
of
investigations
on-site,
114
is
a
notice
statute,
the
same
as
the
fourth
amendment,
and
we
should
probably
note
that
as
a
notice
statute
not
only
is
dow
deprived
of
notice
of
what
the
epa
did
but
the
epa
employees
themselves
who
are
criminally
liable
if
they
disseminate
trade
secrets
under
18
usc
1905.
thank
you.
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
yes,
i
do,
mr.
chief
justice.
to
answer
justice
stevens'
question,
there
is
absolutely
no
reference
in
the
record
that
the
dow
facility
is
on
any
airport
approach
for
the
local
airport.
a
few
other
points
to
bring
out--
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
--your
honor--
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
--your
honor,
in
our
motion
for
summary
judgment
we
did
admit,
being
reasonable
as
we
think
we
are
in
this
case,
that
obviously
planes
fly
over
or
near
the
plant,
but
that's
a
fair
step
from
saying
it's
on
an
airport
takeoff
and
landing
pattern.
it
may
have
been
mentioned
during
oral
argument
by
the
government.
i
don't
know.
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
it's
about
ten
miles,
justice
rehnquist.
ms.
miss
jane
m.
gootee
the
one-half
inch
detail
that
was
mentioned
is
visible
on
the
original
epa
photographs.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
enlargements.
you've
heard
a
lot
from
the
government
about
dow's
position,
dow's
feelings,
dow's
property.
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
dow
briefs
for
those
statements.
we
have
heard
nothing
from
the
government
about
justification
for
what
the
epa
did,
and
i
would
bring
that
to
the
court's
attention.
the
government
states
that
it
doesn't
know
whether
the
fourth
amendment
would
keep
people
out
of
the
dow
plant.
well,
we'd
like
to
remind
the
government
that
the
fourth
amendment
was
written
to
oblige
the
government
to
control
itself.
it
does
not
apply
to
private
parties.
in
this
case
dow
is
asking
for
the
status
quo.
case
law
of
this
court
shows
that
commercial,
non-public
areas
are
entitled
to
fourth
amendment
protection.
it
is
mutually
exclusive
from
an
open
field.
finally,
it
is
the
law
of
this
court
that
the
use
of
technology
to
intrude
into
the
private
details
of
a
protected
place
is
an
unreasonable
search.
thank
you.
