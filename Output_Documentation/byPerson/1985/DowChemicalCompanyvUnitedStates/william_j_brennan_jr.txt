now,
that
was
an
on
the
ground
inspection?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
would
you
object
to
standing
on
the
hillside
with
a
camera?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
taking
pictures
from
that
spot?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it
would
be
more
with
a
camera
from
a
hillside
as
well
as
on
a
fly-over?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
take
it
that
they
have
one
of
these...
i
don't
own
one,
but
one
of
these
very...
that
pick
up
everything?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
forgive
me.
i
don't
quite
understand
your
answer.
if
one
is
equipped
with
a
camera
and
there
is
a
hilltop
and
they
can
photograph
from
that
spot
the
things
that
were
photographed
by
the
fly-over,
would
that
be
objectionable?
