you
do
agree
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
address
the
statutory
question
because
by
doing
that
we
could
avoid
theoretically
the
constitutional
issues,
do
you
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
they
prevail.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
it's
appropriate
to
address
it,
i
suppose.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
gather
it's
your
theory
that
the
word
"allowed"
does
not
mean
benefited--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
substance.
it
means
allowed,
and
it
was
allowed.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
government
says
it
was
allowed
because
the
taxpayer
did
not
have
to
pay
a
gift
tax
at
the
time.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
at
the
time
the
gift
was
made
the
government
says
he
did
not
then
have
to
pay
a
gift
tax;
therefore,
it
was
allowed.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what's
your
response
to
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
that
wasn't
adopted,
was
it?
