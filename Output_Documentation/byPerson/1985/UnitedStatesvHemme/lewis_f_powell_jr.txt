mr.
lauber,
excuse
me
for
interrupting
you,
but
i'd
like
to
know
whether
you
think
we
have
to
decide
both
the
statutory
and
the
constitutional
issue.
did
the
district
court
decide
anything
except
the
constitutional
issue?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
we
reverse
on
that
issue,
would
we
have
to
go
any
further?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
page
are
you
reading
from?
