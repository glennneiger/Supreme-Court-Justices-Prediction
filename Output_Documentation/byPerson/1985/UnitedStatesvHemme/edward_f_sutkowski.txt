mr.
edward
f.
sutkowski
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
address
your
attention
to
page
2
of
the
government's
brief,
which
near
the
bottom
summarizes
their
position
and
i
think
will
make
the
decision
in
this
case
rather
straightforward.
specifically,
the
government
proposes
that:
"rather,
the
unified
credit
in
such
circumstances.
"
--relating
to
the
transaction
in
this
case...
"was
required
to
be
reduced
to
reflect
the
transfer
tax
benefit--
"
mr.
edward
f.
sutkowski
--page
2
of
the
government's
brief...
"to
reflect
the
transfer
tax
benefit
that
the
transferor
had
already
garnered.
"
several
questions
have
been
raised
by
the
court
with
respect
to
that
benefit,
and
counsel
has
referred
to
the
estate
of
renick
case,
the
court
of
claims
case
which
is
offered
in
support
of
the
government's
position.
in
that
case,
the
court
of
claims
held
that
the
taxpayer
in
essentially
similar
circumstances,
although
the
taxpayer
in
renick
had
made
the
gift
on
december
30
of
the
year,
that
is
to
say
after
the
date
of
enactment,
as
contrasted
with
the
taxpayer
in
this
case
who
made
the
gifts
prior
to
the
date
of
enactment
but
after
the
applicable
committee
reports
had
been
published.
the
court
of
claims
held
that
it
appeared
that
the
taxpayer
in
renick
would
benefit
from
the
$30,000
exclusion.
in
any
event,
the
single
item
of
legislative
history
turning
on
the
passing
use
of
the
word
"benefited"
does
not
warrant
departing
from
the
unambiguous
language
of
the
statute.
putting
it
another
way,
the
court
of
claims
held
that,
having
tentatively
benefited
by
this
gift,
this
claimed
exemption,
is
tantamount
or
the
same
as
having
garnered
that
forever.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
real
distinction
to
be
drawn
in
this
case
is
between
the
taxpayer
who
suffered
the
unfortunate
consequence
of
having
died
within
the
three-year
period
preceding...
succeeding
the
date
of
the
gift
and
the
one
who
had
not.
in
the
case
of
mr.
hirschi,
having
no
control
over
only
that
event,
which
incidentally
was
the
only
event
that
transpired
after
the
effective
date
of
this
legislation,
his
death,
he
was
docketed.
he
was
not
attempting
to
double
dip.
he
was
penalized.
that
is
to
say,
the
property
that
was
subject
to
the
lifetime
transfer
tax,
the
gift
tax,
suffering
the
reduction
of
his
unified
credit
to
the
extent
of
20
percent
of
the
specific
exemption
allowed,
i.e.,
$6,000,
and
the
property
was
brought
back
into
his
estate
for
estate
tax
purposes
and
subject
to
tax
under
that
system,
with
no
corresponding
restoration
of
the
credit
that
had
been
absorbed
by
operation
of
the
rule
under
2010(c).
mr.
edward
f.
sutkowski
statutory
in
the
sense
that
it
focuses
on
the
word
"allowed"
and
"allowable".
mr.
edward
f.
sutkowski
and
in
the
court
of
claims,
incidentally,
your
honor,
they
misquoted
the
statute
as
suggesting
the
word
"allowable"
in
the
first
instance.
but
the
statute
in
2010(c)
specifically
provides
that
to
the
extent
that
the
specific
exemption
was
allowed,
not
allowable.
the
court
of
claims
has
simply
misquoted
the
operative
provision
of
the
statute
in
the
statutory
sense,
so
it
seems
to
me
that
the
renick
case
is--
mr.
edward
f.
sutkowski
--by
virtue
of
an
event
arising
after
the
transaction,
namely
mr.
hirschi's
death,
and
by
virtue
of
the
government--
mr.
edward
f.
sutkowski
--that's
correct.
mr.
edward
f.
sutkowski
it
was
never
allowed
in
the
committee
sense
of
the
word.
the
relevant
committee
reports--
mr.
edward
f.
sutkowski
--well,
now
they
disallowed.
mr.
edward
f.
sutkowski
and
the
relevant
committee
reports
provide
that
the
taxpayer
was
to
have
benefited
from
the
use
of
this
transitional
rule,
suffered
no
detriment,
not
been
penalized,
but
was
to
have
been
benefited
by
the
invocation
of
this
election.
and
incidentally,
the
reference
to
benefited
was
found
in
not
just
the
conference
committee
report,
but
its
antecedent
the
house
ways
and
means
committee
report,
which
has
suggested
that
the
unified
credit
be
docketed,
if
you
will,
be
decreased
by
20
percent
of
the
specific
exemption
if
it
had
been
absorbed
by
a
taxpayer
from
the
date
of
the
enactment
of
the
gift
tax
legislation,
some
44
years
ago.
so
we're
not
really
focusing
upon
a
114-day
window
transitional
period
here
in
the
sense
of
the
use
of
the
word
"benefited".
we're
talking
about
a
transaction
that
was
put
into
place
with
reference
to
the
use
of
the
specific
exemption
from
the
date
of
the
enactment
of
the
gratuitous
transfer
tax.
mr.
edward
f.
sutkowski
no,
it
was
not.
but
that's
the
context
in
terms
of
benefit.
in
terms
of
the
rush
to
the
door
to
accomplish
this
objective,
that
is
to
say
to
decrease
the
revenues
available
to
the
government
or
to
redistribute
wealth
within
the
114-day
transitional
period,
i
would
merely
suggest
to
the
court
that
there
was
no
rush
to
the
door
in
that
sense
of
the
word.
there's
no
national
emergency
at
issue
here,
as
has
been
the
case
in
several
of
the
other
retroactive
income
tax
cases
and
one
estate
tax
case.
but
in
this
gift
tax
here,
there
could
have
been
no
rush
to
the
door
inasmuch
as
all
this
individual
did
was
to
take
advantage
of
a
beneficial...
an
election
which
was
to
be
beneficial.
and
as
the
individual
died
within
the
three
year
period
beginning
on
the
date
of
the
gift,
that
was
brought
back
into
the
individual's
estate.
and
not
only
was
a
rush
prevented,
but
mr.
hirschi,
the
taxpayer,
and
his
successors
was
penalized
for
having
availed
himself
of
what
was
to
have
been
a
beneficial
election.
putting
it
another
way,
a
distinction
should
be
drawn
as
between
mr.
hirschi,
who
took
advantage
of
the
procedure
set
forth
in
the
committee
reports
and
had
the
misfortune
of
dying
within
three
years,
and
an
individual
who
did
the
same
and
did
not
have
the
misfortune
of
dying
within
three
years.
those
two
taxpayers
are
treated
quite
differently,
inasmuch
as
mr.
hirschi
is
penalized
to
the
extent
of
$6,000
for
having
availed
mr.
hirschi
of
that
particular
beneficial
election.
mr.
edward
f.
sutkowski
i'm
sorry,
would
you
repeat
that
question,
please?
mr.
edward
f.
sutkowski
that's
correct,
except
that
we
did
suffer
a
detriment
of
$6,000
more
than
a
similarly
situated
taxpayer
who
had
not
died
under
the
same
set
of
circumstances.
mr.
edward
f.
sutkowski
no,
he
would
not.
under
the
new
law--
mr.
edward
f.
sutkowski
--under
the
new
law,
your
honor,
my
understanding
of
the
operation
of
the
new
law
for
transactions
occurring
after
12-31-76,
there
was
a
conclusive
presumption.
the
three-year
rule
automatically
brought
the
property
back
in.
and
as
was
the
case
under
the
prior
law,
as
justice
white
brought
out
earlier
in
his
question
to
counsel,
under
the
old
law
2035
would
have
operated
to
bring
the
property
back
into
the
decedent's
estate
and
give
credit
against
the
estate
tax
base
for
the
gift
taxes
paid.
mr.
edward
f.
sutkowski
well,
that's
correct.
but
you
didn't
take
the
exemption.
that
is,
you
took
it,
but
you
didn't
receive
it,
putting
it
another
way.
mr.
edward
f.
sutkowski
that's
not
necessarily
true,
your
honor.
under
the
new
law,
under
the
new
system,
this
taxpayer
suffered
more
than
what
a
similarly
situated
taxpayer
who
did
not
die
within
the
three-year
period.
mr.
edward
f.
sutkowski
well,
by
virtue
of
his
death
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
f.
sutkowski
my
concern
would
be,
your
honor,
what
sort
of
rationale
legislative
purpose
could
be
ascribed
to
the
drawing
of
a
distinction
between
an
alive
and
a
dead
taxpayer,
especially
in
light
of
the
committee
reports
that
suggest
that
this
taxpayer
had
the
right
to
make
this
election
and
avail
the
taxpayer
of
a
benefit
and
then,
having
made
the
benefit,
was
deprived
of
$6,000
in
additional
property.
i'm
wondering
if
the
difference
should
be
if
it--
mr.
edward
f.
sutkowski
--well,
it
depends
upon
what
system
we're
visiting
about
here.
mr.
edward
f.
sutkowski
under
the
new
law,
the
three
year
rule
was
conclusive.
it
would
automatically
be
within
the
transfer
tax
base.
mr.
edward
f.
sutkowski
except
that
in
our
situation,
because
we
were
within
the
transitional
period,
we
suffered
a
double
tax.
the
issue
has
been
considered,
i
believe,
as
to
the
absence
of
property
being
taken.
it's
our
position
that
$6,000
in
additional
property
was
taken
by
virtue
of
the
operation
of
this
rule.
the
government
has
asserted
that
the
district
court,
the
court
below,
has
mischaracterized
this
2010(c)
as
retroactive
legislation.
i
think
a
review
of
the
relevant
facts
will
suggest
that
this
indeed
is
retroactive
legislation
and
one
that
should
not
be
countenanced
by
this
court.
specifically,
the
events
giving
rise...
the
material
events
giving
rise
to
the
transaction
were
as
follows.
on
september
14th
of
'76,
a
conference
committee
report
was
issued
which
displayed
the
language
about
benefit
to
be
availed
by
the
taxpayer
making
the
selection.
mr.
hirschi
made
his
gifts
on
september
28th,
filed
his
gift
tax
return
in
a
timely
fashion.
i'm
not
quite
sure
what's
to
be
made
of
the
fact
that
he
filed
his
tax
return
on
september
30.
i
suppose
any
taxpayer
that
files
their
tax
returns
on
january
1
of
the
year
succeeding
the
year
in
question
is
to
be
looked
upon
as
someone
who
is
evil.
on
october
4,
the
legislation
was
enacted
and
was
deemed
to
be
retroactive
to
the
date
before
these
gifts
were
made.
mr.
hirschi,
as
is
suggested,
had
the
misfortune
of
dying
within
the
three-year
period.
it
seems
to
me
that,
as
was
the
case
in
the
first
gift
tax
case
of
significance
decided
by
this
court,
when
all
events
giving
rise
to
the
transaction
occurred
before
the
date
of
the
enactment,
it's
constitutionally
impermissible
to
go
backwards
and
impose
a
tax
upon
the
completed
gift.
and
i
think
in
reviewing
the
three
different
types
of
taxes...
that
is,
the
income
tax,
the
estate
tax,
and
the
gift
tax...
very
real
distinctions
are
to
be
drawn
as
among
those
three.
as
to
the
income
tax,
where
retroactivity
seems
to
be
the
day,
for
good
reason,
the
taxpayer
has
either
the
cash
generated
from
his,
the
taxpayer's,
activities,
or
the
property
which
has
been
the
subject
of
the
sale
from
which
to
pay
the
tax.
moreover,
there
is
a
national
objective
to
be
served
in
protecting
the
revenue
accounting
periods,
fiscal
periods,
in
the
administration
of
that
statute.
in
the
estate
tax
area,
it's
been
universally
recognized
that
the
facts
in
existence
at
the
date
of
the
taxpayer's
death
govern
the
transaction.
we
see
this
as
the
case
with
joint
tenancy
properties
and
in
the
case
of
retained
life
estates,
life
insurance
policy
transfers.
in
all
situations,
the
facts
in
existence
at
the
date
of
the
taxpayer's
death,
after
which
period
the
taxpayer
has
no
need
to
store
up
money
with
which
to
live.
mr.
edward
f.
sutkowski
this
court
is
milliken
suggested
that
if
the
change
was
in
the
mere
rate,
which
was
essentially
that
sort
of
case...
that
is,
if
you're
speaking
of
a
situation
where
we
had
the
transfer
in
contemplation
of
death
issue
available
to
us
and
we're
merely
changing
rates--
mr.
edward
f.
sutkowski
--i
do
not
think
they
could
constitutionally
in
the
gift
tax
area.
mr.
edward
f.
sutkowski
the
reason
the
gift
tax
area
differs
from
the
other
two
areas
i
think
is
quite
obvious.
namely,
the
taxpayer
measures
the
amount
of
the
gift
which
is
to
be
incurred
before
proceeding
to
engage
in
a
voluntary,
irrevocable
act.
mr.
edward
f.
sutkowski
and
how
much
money
the
taxpayer
needs.
mr.
edward
f.
sutkowski
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that
taxpayer
measures
the
excess
of
the
property
the
taxpayer
has
over
what
the
taxpayer
needs,
and
if--
mr.
edward
f.
sutkowski
--well,
the
test
that
counsel
has
alluded
to
is
that
we
look
to
the
facts
and
circumstances
in
existence
at
the
date
of
death.
but
when
we're
talking
about
2035,
a
transfer
in
contemplation
of
death,
that's
by
definition
a
bring-back
statute.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
untermeyer
v.
anderson,
the
critical
case
in
this
area
involving
the
gift
tax,
the
application
of
the
gift
tax
retroactively
to
transactions
completed,
if
the
facts
suggested
by
the
justice
would
be
applied
to
that
case
the
result
would
be
precisely
the
same.
that
is
to
say,
you
cannot
enact
a
piece
of
legislation
that
purports
to
go
back
four
years
before
it's
effective
date
and
picks
up
a
gift
tax
transaction
and
brings
it
back
into
the
taxable
estate
of
the
transferor,
as
contrasted
with
an
income
tax
situation,
where
the
assets
are
there,
the
income
has
been
made.

bad

in
this
estate
and
gift
tax,
the
gratuitous
transfer
tax
area,
this
tax
had
been
on
the
books
for
over
40
years.
it
had
been
the
subject
of
repeated
attempted
rehauls
for
a
period
of
time,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
only
after
this
piece
of
legislation
came
on
the
books
did
we
have
an
overhaul,
an
attempt
to
systematize
the
overall
mechanism
of
the
transfer
tax
base,
which
incidentally,
my
understanding,
doesn't
account
for
a
terrific
amount
of
revenue,
which
is
not
to
say
it's
meaningless,
but
it
is
to
suggest
that
this
was
not
a
situation
that
warranted
a
national
knee-jerk
reaction,
to
let's
punish
those
that
availed
themselves
of
this
particular
benefit,
but
was
specifically
designed
to
provide
some
sort
of
transitional
rule
that
would
prohibit
someone
from
taking
advantage
of
both
systems,
achieving
the
ability
to
use
$30,000
worth
of
gift
tax-free
transfers
and
yet
not
sustain
any
detriment
in
terms
of
the
ensuing
unified
credit
which
was
under
the
new
system.
mr.
herschi
and
his
successors
were
not
of
a
class
that
attempted
to
take
advantage
of
that,
that
is
to
say
were
not
of
a
class
that
were
double
dipping.
mr.
edward
f.
sutkowski
i
suppose
that's
why
we're
here.
mr.
edward
f.
sutkowski
yes,
it
didn't
work.
and
i
would
suggest
it's
not
because
of
ill-advised
tax
planning.
i
would
suggest
it's
as
a
consequence
of
very
highly
sophisticated,
knowledgeable
tax
planning
on
the
part
of
counsel
for
mr.
hirschi,
that
suggested
to
mr.
hirschi,
if
anything,
i'd
suggest
that
you
take
advantage
of
this
election
that
is
a
one-time
114-day
window
period
benefit
available
to
you,
and
that
you
make
the
election
irrespective
of
whatever
else
may
arise
and
proceed.
and
he
did.
mr.
edward
f.
sutkowski
well,
unfortunately
i
have
yet
to
find
an
individual
who
knows
when
the
grim
reaper
will
be--
mr.
edward
f.
sutkowski
--let
alone
a
lawyer.
there
are
many
things
that
we
are
supposed
to
know.
that's
one
that
i'm
not
sure
that
even
i
can
guess
at.
in
this
particular
instance--
mr.
edward
f.
sutkowski
--well,
i
think
they
know
most
of
it.
the
actuaries
know
everything,
i
understand,
in
terms
of
mortality.
mr.
edward
f.
sutkowski
in
the
case...
in
the
government's
brief,
they
suggest
that
the
astute
taxpayer,
the
knowledgeable
taxpayer,
should
have
waited
until
november
15th
of
that
same
year,
with
a
view
toward
comparing
the
relative
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
making
this
election.
i
submit
to
this
court
that
the
taxpayer
had
to
perform
one
other
act
within
that
period,
and
that's
die.
he
had
to
also
be
sure
that
the
statute
as
read
really
meant
what
it
didn't
mean,
meant
what
it
didn't
say.
put
another
way,
the
word
mr.
hirschi.
in
terms
of
the
notice
aspect
which
counsel
has
alluded
to,
he
states
in
the
reply
briefs
and
in
the
original
brief,
the
suggestion
on
page
24,
and
i
quote,
was
that:
"in
any
event,
the
committee
reports
provided
him,
the
decedent,
with
constructive
notice
of
what
the
effect
of
claiming
the
specific
exemption
was
very
likely
to
be.
"
i
suggested
at
page
24
of
our
brief
that,
in
reviewing
that
rule,
the
house
report
provided
that
there
was
to
be
a
docking
of
20
percent
of
the
amount
allowed
as
a
specific
exemption
in
computing
the
taxable
gifts
under
the
present
law,
and
thus
in
the
case
where
a
donor
had
benefited
from
the
use
of
the
full
$30,000
gift
tax
specific
exemption
under
present
law,
the
maximum
unified
credit
allowable
would
be
reduced
by
$6,000.
on
page
24
of
our
brief,
i
suggest
that
notice,
if
that's
the
issue,
the
notice
would
have
apprised
the
taxpayer
of
the
consequences
of
this
election,
not
just
that
the
taxpayer
was
to
receive
a
benefit
of
the
election,
but
if
the
taxpayer
made
the
election
and
then
had
the
misfortune
of
dying
within
three
years
from
the
date
of
the
gift
that
property
would
not
only
be
brought
back
into
the
taxpayer's
taxable
base,
but
there
would
be
no
restoration
of
the
credit
that
had
been
absorbed
by
virtue
of
the
transaction.
and
to
that
end,
the
committee
reports
should
have
added
to
them,
and
i
suggested,
that
even
if
the
property
which
was
the
subject
of
the
claimed
$30,000
gift
tax
specific
exemption
is
subsequently
included
in
the
donor's
estate
by
reason
of
2035,
that
the
result
would
then
be
dictated
as
the
government
has
suggested.
phrased
differently,
there
was
no
actual
notice,
there
was
no
constructive
notice.
in
fact,
there
was
a
bit
of
a
snare
for
the
sophisticated
taxpayer
with
sophisticated
tax
advice,
to
the
effect
that
if
we
make
this
beneficial
election
we'll
have
the
benefit
of
that
election
forever.
in
terms
of
the
constitutional
arguments,
i
would
suggest
that
this
case
is
not
an
income
tax
case.
this
case
is
not
as
estate
tax
case
in
the
sense
that
there
was
reference
in
the
amicus
to
this
hafner
case,
where
that's
a
completely
different
issue,
but
all
sorts
of
gifts
of
taxable
or
exempt
bonds,
depending
upon
someone's
perspective,
that
were
transferred
before
dates
of
enactment.
there
was
perhaps
a
rush
to
the
door
in
hafner
and
its
progeny.
this
was
not
a
national
emergency
case,
as
the
case
of
gray
v.
the
pension
benefit
guaranty
corporation.
there
was
no
double
dipping
in
the
case
of
this
taxpayer,
and
the
events
giving
rise
to
the
transaction,
the
completed
gifts,
all
occurred
before
the
date
of
enactment.
but
for
the
death
of
this
individual
within
the
three
year
period,
we
i
suppose
would
not
be
here.
mr.
edward
f.
sutkowski
the
net
result,
yes.
mr.
edward
f.
sutkowski
i
only
wish
it
were
for
60
and
600,
and
perhaps,
if
it
were
500,
the
constitutional
and
statutory
arguments
would
be
more
momentous.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
retroactivity
issue
and
the
constitutional
issue
are
equally
applicable,
as
is
obviously
the
case.
mr.
edward
f.
sutkowski
you
haven't
seen
hafner
yet,
your
honor.
