justice
byron
r.
white
he'd
have
had
to
use
it
all
up
to
avoid
paying
the
tax.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
lauber,
weren't
the
full
amount
of
the
gifts
included
in
his
estate?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
they
were
gifts
in
contemplation
of
death.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
they
were
subject
to
the
estate
tax.
justice
byron
r.
white
whereas
if
they
hadn't
been
in
contemplation
of
death,
it
wouldn't
have...
they
wouldn't
have
been
included
in
his
estate?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
the
law
had
never
been
changed,
and
under
the
old
law
what
would
happen
in
a
gift
in
contemplation
of
death
where
somebody
made
a
gift
in
contemplation
of
death
and
took
his
exemption
and
paid
some
tax
and
then
he
had
to
pay
his
estate
tax,
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
he
had
made
$60,000
in
gifts?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
paid
tax,
and
then
it's
all
included
in
his
estate.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
don't
you
think
that
makes
some
difference
in
this
case,
that
he
can't
be
double-dipping?
he's
going
to
get
socked
for
the
amount
of
his
gifts
in
his
estate
tax.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
good
did
his
gift
tax
credit
do
him
if
all
of
his
property
is
included
in
his
estate?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
you're
talking
to
is
you're
dealing
with
the
estate
and
you
say
the
estate
has
to
reduce
its
credit
by
$6,000.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
certainly
didn't
get
the
benefit
he
would
have
had
if
it
hadn't
been
in
contemplation
of
death.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
he
now
has
to
face
the
estate
tax.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
just
seems
to
me
that
because
these
gifts
were
included
in
his
estate,
he's
not
exactly
in
the
same
position
to
have
his
exemption
reduced
as
somebody
who
really
got
the
benefit.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
take
it
you
would
treat
this
taxpayer
like
the
taxpayer
who
made
the
same
gifts,
except
that
they
were
not
in
contemplation
of
death?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
both
of
them
would
be
reduced
$6,000?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you're
only
going
to
reduce
it
$6,000,
the
fellow
whose
gifts
were
not
in
contemplation
of
death,
his
estate
taxes
would
be
substantially
lower.
justice
byron
r.
white
very
much
lower.
justice
byron
r.
white
$6,000
worth.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's...
i
suppose
you
could
call
this
both
a
statutory
and
a
constitutional
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
later
disallowed--
justice
byron
r.
white
--by
taking
it
into
his
estate.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
difference
between
somebody
who
dies
in
three
years
and
someone
who
doesn't
is
not
the
government
would
deduct
$6,000
from
both
of
them,
but
the
difference
would
be
in
the
estate
tax.
i
mean,
there
would
be
more
in
the
estate.
in
your
client's
estate,
the
gifts
would
be
included.
in
the
one
who
didn't
die
within
three
years,
it
wouldn't
be
included.
justice
byron
r.
white
we're
talking
about
it
under
the
new
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
may
have
attempted
to,
but
they--
justice
byron
r.
white
--in
the
long
run,
in
the
long
run
it
didn't
work.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
just
probably
thought
he
was
healthier
than
he
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
let
alone
a
lawyer.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
an
accountant.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
didn't
work
out
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
would
still
have
to...
he
would
get
his
unified
tax
cut
by
$6,000.
