mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal,
somewhat
unusual
for
a
tax
case,
because
the
district
court
declared
a
provision
of
the
revenue
code
unconstitutional
as
a
retroactive
law
that
deprives
appellees
of
property
without
due
process.
in
their
brief
on
the
merits
appellees,
while
not
abandoning
this
constitutional
theory,
seem
to
place
greater
reliance
upon
the
statutory
construction
argument,
a
variant
of
which
they
presented
below,
but
which
the
district
court
did
not
pass
upon.
before
talking
about
either
of
these
arguments,
i'd
like
to
explain
briefly
how
the
challenged
statute
works,
which
is
a
little
bit
complicated
in
some
ways.
the
challenged
statute
is
section
210(c)
of
the
revenue
code,
which
congress
enacted
in
1976.
this
is
one
example
of
many
transitional
rules
that
congress
from
time
to
time
puts
into
the
revenue
code
to
bridge
the
gap
between
an
older
statutory
regime
and
an
amended
regime.
in
1976
congress
overhauled
the
estate
and
gift
tax
quite
comprehensively.
one
thing
congress
did
was
to
effect
an
overall
reduction
of
estate
taxes,
particularly
for
smaller
estates.
congress
also
brought
about
a
degree
of
integration
between
the
gift
tax
and
the
estate
tax.
for
present
purposes,
the
most
relevant
integrating
thing
congress
did
was
to
repeal
a
pair
of
exemptions
that
were
available
under
the
old
law...
they
were
basically
deductions...
and
replace
them
with
a
single
unified
credit
under
the
new
law.
under
the
old
law,
a
taxpayer
during
life
was
entitled
to
exempt
a
total
of
$30,000
of
his
property
in
gift
form
from
the
gift
tax.
that
was
in
addition
to
the
annual
exclusion
of
$3,000
per
donee.
the
donor
was
free
to
claim
this
$30,000
exemption
in
whole
or
in
part,
whenever
he
wanted
it.
at
his
death,
his
estate
was
then
entitled
to
exempt
$60,000
of
property
from
the
estate
tax,
and
the
ability
to
claim
that
was
independent
of
the
donor's
inter
vivos
claim
of
the
gift
tax
exemption.
in
1976
congress
abolished
both
of
those
exemptions
and
replaced
them
with
a
single
unified
credit,
which
was
designed
to
replace
both
the
gift
tax
$3,000
exemption
and
the
estate
tax
$60,000
exemption.
and
the
new
credit
was
to
be
available
against
either
or
both
of
these
taxes
as
first
incurred.
that
meant
that
somebody
could
use
part
of
the
unified
credit
for
gifts
during
life
and
what
he
didn't
use
would
be
available
to
be
used
against
the
estate
tax
by
his
executor
after
his
death.
congress
realized
that
there
was
a
problem
of
continuity
here,
because
some
people
would
have
claimed
the
$30,000
gift
tax
exemption
in
whole
or
in
part
during
life
for
gifts
they
made
prior
to
1977.
the
effective
date
of
the
new
law
was
january
1st,
1977.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
that's
right,
because
after
the
new
law
was
enacted
that
abolished
the
old
gift
tax
exemption,
and
everything
was
then
governed
by
the
unified
credit.
so
if
he
had
made
the
gifts
on
january
2,
he
would
have
had
to
use
up
part
of
his
unified
credit
or
pay
gift
tax
on
the
transfer.
so
if
he
gave
away
$30,000
on
january
2,
he
would
have
had
to
use
up--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
it
was
45,
right,
including
the
five
little
ones.
he
would
have
had
to
use
up
part
of
his
unified
credit
in
order
to
avoid
paying
gift
tax.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
think
not
all,
because
the
credit
is
dollar
for
dollar
against
the
tax,
whereas
the
old
exemption
you
only
get
a
number
of
cents
on
the
dollar
equal
to
your
marginal
rate.
anyway,
congress
saw
there
was
a
problem
of
continuity
because
if
people
who
previously
had
claimed
and
been
allowed
their
$30,000
gift
tax
exemption
got
the
full
unified
credit,
which
was
meant
to
be
a
replacement
for
the
old
exemption,
they'd
get
the
same
thing
twice.
so
to
prevent
this
problem
congress
enacted
the
challenged
provision,
section
210(c)
of
the
code.
and
it
provides
that
the
unified
credit
available
to
a
person
or
his
estate
would
be
reduced
by
an
amount
equal
to
20
percent
of
the
aggregate
amount
allowed
as
a
specific
exemption
under
prior
law
for
gifts
made
after
the
day
the
conference
committee
approved
the
new
bill
and
before
the
end
of
the
year.
the
purpose
of
the
provision
was
to
prevent
what
this
court
has
called
a
rush
to
the
door
by
people
trying
to
hurry
up
and
make
a
lot
of
gifts
at
the
end
of
the
year
in
the
hope
of
double-dipping
by
getting
both
the
old
exemption
plus
a
full
new
credit.
the
reason
why
congress
picked
20
percent
as
the
multiplier
to
work
out
this
reduction
isn't
clear,
but
it's
generally
thought
congress
figured
that
was
equal
to
the
average
effective
gift
tax
rate,
and
therefore...
in
fact,
gift
tax
rates
ranged
from
about
three
percent
to
58
percent.
but
congress
apparently
thought
that
the
average
effective
rate
paid
by
the
nation's
taxpayers
as
a
whole
on
their
gifts
was
about
20
percent
and
therefore
that
if
you
took
that
out
of
the
unified
credit
you
would
be
compensating
for
the
tax
benefit
on
average
realized
by
most
people
who
claimed
the
old
exemption.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
it
really,
you
would
think
it's
something--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--congress
would
have
thought
about.
they
may
have
just
picked
the
number
out
of
their
hats
for
all
we
know.
as
the
appellees
have
noted,
the
estate
and
gift
tax
provisions
were
a
little
bit
of
a
last
minute
addition.
the
senate
i
think
hadn't
incorporated
a
similar
regime,
and
maybe
congress
didn't
flesh
out
what
it
was
doing
as
well
as
it
might
have.
but
it
picked
20
percent,
apparently
believing
that
would
approximate
the
average
of
tax
benefit
that
people
realized
who
claimed
the
exemption
before.
now,
the
facts
of
this
case
are
that
the
decedent,
mr.
hirschi,
made
his
gifts
on
september
28th,
1976,
which
was
during
the
transitional
period
covered
by
section
210(c).
he
made
his
gifts
three
weeks
after
the
conference
committee
approved
the
bill,
two
weeks,
about,
after
both
houses
of
congress
passed
the
bill,
but
one
week
before
the
exemption
signed
the
bill.
he
made
his
gifts
to
five
people
who
were
all
objects
of
his
bounty,
being
either
blood
relatives
or
in-laws.
the
amount
of
his
gifts,
$45,000,
which
was
apparently
tailored
exactly
to
use
up
his
full
$30,000
lifetime
gift
tax
exemption
and
his
five
annual
exclusions
for
his
five
donees.
in
other
words,
he
gave
away
as
much
as
he
could
without
paying
any
tax.
two
days
later
he
filed
a
gift
tax
return,
on
the
last
day
of
the
quarter,
claiming
the
entire
$30,000
gift
tax
exemption,
reporting
zero
taxable
gifts
and
no
gift
tax
due.
and
this
return,
for
all
the
records
show,
was
accepted
as
filed
by
the
commissioner
and
no
gift
tax
was
ever
assessed
against
or
paid
by
mr.
hirschi.
mr.
hirschi
died
two
years
later,
in
november
of
'78,
well
after
section
210(c)
was
enacted
into
law.
his
executors
claimed,
who
are
appellees,
claimed
the
full
unified
credit
against
the
estate
tax.
the
commissioner
took
the
position
that
under
section
210(c),
our
transitional
rule,
that
had
to
be
reduced
by
$6,000,
20
percent
of
the
$30,000
gift
tax
exemption
that
mr.
hirschi
had
claimed
during
the
transitional
period.
even
so,
after
the
reduction
of
the
unified
credit
from
34
to
28,000,
still
the
estate
paid
less
estate
tax
than
it
would
have
paid
had
congress
never
amended
the
tax
laws
in
1976.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
that's
correct,
justice
white,
all
$45,000
were
included
in
his
estate.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
right.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
that's
correct.
there
are
other
ways--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
under
the
old
law,
if
he
had
made
the
gift
in
contemplation
of
death
and
say
he
claimed
the
$30,000
exemption
and
paid
no
tax--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--you
then
have
the
property
included
in
the
estate,
subject
to
estate
tax,
and
he
would
basically
have
wasted
the
specific
exemption,
claimed
it,
but
aside
from
the
time
value
of
money
by
deferring
the
tax
he
wouldn't
really
have
gotten
a
great
tax
benefit.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
and
paid
tax?
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
then
he'd
get
a
credit
against
the
estate
tax
in
the
amount
of
gift
tax
paid.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
no,
that's
not
right,
justice
white,
because
don't
forget
that
the
unified
credit--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
he
got
several
things
from
it.
first
of
all,
he
paid
no
gift
tax
in
september
of
'76.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
which
would
have
had
to
have
been
otherwise
paid.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
it
was
deferred
until
several
years
later.
furthermore,
he
deferred
the
tax...
he
avoided
paying
the
tax
himself,
because
there
was
no
gift
tax,
and
instead
it
came
in
the
form
of
an
estate
tax--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--paid
by
his
estate.
so
he
benefited.
his
estate,
his
heirs,
may
not
be
particularly
happy.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
right,
an
account
of
the
tax
benefit
that
mr.
hirschi
got
from
the
gift
tax.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well
that's
true.
he
gambled--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--that's
right.
but
it
often
happened
in
the
prior
law,
justice
white,
that
people
could
waste
their
exemption,
and
people
could
claim
a
$30,000
gift
tax
exemption
on
a
gift,
but
that
gift
could
wind
up
being
included
in
the
estate
as
a
gift
in
contemplation
of
death,
as
a
transfer
with
a
retained
life
interest,
as
a
transfer
with
power
of
appointment
reserved.
in
any
of
those
cases,
it
would
be
subject
to
estate
tax
and
he
would
have
wasted
his
gift
tax
exemption.
and
there
was
no
change
in
that
from
the
old
law
to
the
new
law,
because
what
happened
under
the
new
law
is
the
waste
of
the
old
exemption
is
reflected
in
the
removal
of
that
chunk
of
the
unified
credit.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
that's
the
statutory
argument
that
the
appellees
make,
and
perhaps
i
should
just
go
right
into
that.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
his
estate,
the
group.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
if
congress
had
never
amended
the
law,
the
figures
we're
comparing,
what
would
have
happened
if
he
had...
if
congress
had
never
changed
the
law
at
all,
enacted
our
provision--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--the
tax
under
those
rates--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--right.
assuming
these
same
facts
and
that
congress
either
did
or
did
not
pass
the
law
we're
considering,
he
paid
less
tax
overall,
even
with
this
reduction
of
$6,000.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
no.
you
could
if
you
rule--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--yes,
if
you
rule
for
them.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
we
agree
with
that,
justice
o'connor,
yes.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
what
the
statute
says
is
that
you've
got
to
reduce
the
credit
by
any
amount
allowed
as
a
specific
exemption
under
prior
law.
and
their
theory
is,
although
mr.
hirschi
claimed
the
exemption
and
although
the
commissioner
didn't
disallow
it,
because
he
accepted
the
return
as
filed,
in
effect
or
ultimately
it
was
not
allowed
because
under
the
estate
tax
they
wound
up
paying
estate
tax
on
that
property
anyway.
and
we
think
that
argument
is
foreclosed
by
this
court's
decision
in
1943
in
virginian
hotel,
where
the
court
held
that
the
word
"allowed"
means
claimed
by
the
taxpayer
and
not
objected
to
by
the
commissioner.
and
the
court--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--pardon
me?
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
that
was
an
income
tax
case.
that
involved
depreciation
deductions,
where
somebody
had
claimed
a
depreciation
deduction
in
the
earlier
year
and
had
a
net
loss.
so
he
didn't
really
get
any
benefit
from
the
depreciation.
and
he
asserted
that
the
deduction
wasn't
allowed
for
depreciation,
so
he
shouldn't
have
to
reduce
his
basis
in
the
property
on
that
account.
and
the
court
rejected
that
argument
and
pointed
out
that
our
tax
code
has
no
machinery
for
having
a
formal
allowance
of
deductions.
the
irs
gets
about
100
million
tax
returns--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--exactly
right.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
right.
both
of
them
claimed
the
deduction,
were
allowed
the
deduction.
one
of
them
had
the
misfortune
to
die
within
three
years,
so
that
his
estate
suffered.
but
either
way
the
donor,
who
claimed
it,
was
allowed
the
specific
exemption.
and
the
court
pointed
out--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--right,
rather
than
only
marginally
lower,
as
his--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--overall,
congress
has
reduced
everybody's
estate
tax
in
1976.
but
the
court
in
virginian
hotel
pointed
out
that
every
year
the
commissioner
gets
millions
of
tax
returns
that
are
claiming
billions
of
deductions,
and
there's
no
way
the
commissioner
tells
people,
we
have
allowed
your
deduction.
what
happens
is
that
the
return
is
accepted
as
filed,
and
that
means
the
deduction
is
allowed,
because
the
tax
is
computed
on
the
basis
of
the
return
as
filed,
including
that
deduction.
and
the
taxpayer
in
virginian
hotel
argued
that
he
got
to
tax
benefit
from
this
claim
which
was
allowed,
and
the
court
held
that
was
immaterial.
now,
what
has
happened
here
is
that
we
think
even
if...
we
don't
think
that
the
premise
of
the
appellees'
argument
is
correct.
we
think
mr.
hirschi
did
derive
some
benefit,
not
the
one
he
hoped
for,
perhaps,
but
he
derived
some
benefit
from
the
claim
of
the
exemption
anyway.
he
deferred
the
tax
for
several
years.
he
didn't
pay
it
himself.
his
estate
paid
it
instead.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
$6,000.
not
quite,
a
little
bit
less.
and
what's
really
happened
here
is
that
the
decedent
probably
got
some
not
terribly
good
tax
advice.
he
probably
was
ill
advised
to
claim
the
specific
exemption,
because
he
was
in
the
lowest
possible
gift
tax
bracket
of
about
three
to
five
percent.
it
would
have
been
wise
for
him
not
to
claim
it
at
all,
because
the
consequence
was
a
reduction
of
20
percent
in
his
unified
credit
his
estate
would
get.
but
despite
the
fact
that
he
may
have
been
unwise
in
claiming
his
exemption,
nevertheless
he
got
the
benefit
from
it,
and
there's
no
indication
that
he
ever
regretted
having
claimed
it.
the
president
signed
the
bill
in
october
and
the
return
is
not
due
for
the
calendar
quarter
until
november
15th.
there's
no
showing
in
the
record
that
mr.
hirschi
tried
to
withdraw
his
gift
tax
return
or
amend
it
to
disclaim
the
exemption,
so
he
apparently
died
content
that
he
had
gotten
his
exemption.
now
his
heirs
and
executors
have
found
out
that
if
he
hadn't
claimed
that
and
died
within
three
years
of
making
the
gifts,
they're
worse
off.
but
that
does
not
mean
mr.
hirschi
did
not
derive
the
benefit
from
the
exemption
he
freely
claimed
on
that
gift
tax
return.
i
guess
i
should
say
a
word
about
the
constitutional
argument
of
the
holding
of
the
court
below.
we
think
that
that
holding
is
wrong
for
at
least
four
reasons.
first
of
all,
as
justice
stevens
and
i
discussed,
it's
hard
to
see
how
anyone
was
deprived
of
property
here
by
the
law.
mr.
hirschi
was
deprived
of
no
property
because
he
paid
no
gift
tax
at
all,
and
his
heirs
wound
up
paying
a
lower
estate
tax
than
would
have
been
true
if
congress
had
not
enacted
this
law.
so
it's
hard
to
see
where
anyone
has
been
deprived
of
property
in
the
least.
secondly,
even
if
one
could
find
a
deprivation
of
property,
we
don't
think
that
this
statute
was
retroactive.
that's
because
the
statute
was
enacted
two
years
before
the
taxable
event,
mr.
hirschi's
transfer
of
property
at
his
death,
occurred.
and
it
is
true
that
the
law
required
the
credit
available
to
the
estate
to
be
computed
by
reference
to
certain
events
that
had
occurred
in
the
past,
but
this
court
has
held
that
that
does
not,
that
fact,
does
not
make
a
law
retroactive.
indeed,
the
estate
tax
has
always
depended
in
computing
the
tax
upon
events
that
may
have
occurred
many,
many
years
before
the
testator
died,
as
for
example
in
the
case
of
gifts
in
contemplation
of
death
or
gifts
with
a
retained
life
interest.
the
mere
fact
that
a
statute
effective
at
the
date
of
death
takes
into
account
events
occurring
prior
to
the
death
of
the
testator
does
not
make
the
statute
retroactive.
thirdly,
even
if
one
could
construe
the
law
as
retroactive,
that
wouldn't
make
in
unconstitutional.
this
court
has
repeatedly
upheld
retroactive
tax
statutes
by
looking
at
all
the
facts
involved
in
the
case.
and
the
factors
the
court
has
considered
are
factors
like
congress'
reason
for
making
the
law
retroactive,
the
harshness
of
the
result
worked
upon
the
taxpayer,
and
the
degree
of
notice
the
taxpayer
had
of
what
congress
was
going.
we
think
all
three
of
those
factors
here
would
make
it
clear
this
law
could
not
be
unconstitutional
properly.
first
of
all,
congress
clearly
had
a
rational
purpose
for
making
the
law
retroactive,
if
such
it
was,
because
congress'
purpose
was
to
prevent
this
rush
to
the
door
by
people
who
were
trying
to
circumvent
the
effect,
the
purpose
of
the
law,
by
taking
advantage
of
a
gap
in
coverage.
that's
clearly
a
rational
purpose.
secondly,
there
was
no
harsh
result
worked
on
the
taxpayer
or
his
heirs
here,
because
they
paid
lower,
a
lower
tax
than
they
would
have
paid
had
the
law
not
been
enacted
at
all.
and
finally,
it
seems
clear
there
was
adequate
notice--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--no,
sir,
it
didn't.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
you
certainly
have
the
option,
if
you
reverse
the
constitutional
holding,
to
remand
it
to
let
the
district
court
consider.
i
mean,
the
appellees
made
a
very
similar
statutory
argument
below.
the
district
court,
for
reasons
it's
hard
to
guess,
didn't
even
mention
it.
so
the
court
certainly
could
remand
it
for
the
district
court
to
decide.
but
we
think
it's
appropriate
for
the
court
to
avoid
that
need
for
a
remand
by
deciding
the
statutory
question
here
if
they
agree
with
us,
if
the
court
agrees
with
us
on
the
constitutional
question.
the
old
court
of
claims
decided
a
very
similar
statutory
issue,
so
you
have
the
benefit
of
that
decision
as
well
as
the
briefs
the
parties
have
filed,
which
have
addressed
it
quite
thoroughly.
but
you're
not
required
to
decide
the
statutory
question.
the
final
factor
i
was
going
to
mention
is
the
factor
of
notice
to
taxpayers,
and
here
the
conference
committee
action
approving
the
bill
certainly
constituted
notice,
constructive
notice
to
taxpayers
of
what
was
going
on.
indeed,
the
court
on
many
occasions
has
upheld
retroactive
laws
when
the
retroactive
activity
date
is
back
to
the
date
of
committee
action.
thank
you.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
one
very
brief
point.
one
way
of
looking
at
the
tax
benefit
that
mr.
hirschi
got,
aside
from
deferring
the
tax
to
his
heirs
and
the
time
value
of
money,
is
that
he
took
a
gamble.
he
gambled
that
if
he
claimed
this
benefit
and
he
lived
three
years
he'd
never
be
taxed,
either
under
the
gift
tax
or
the
estate
tax.
he
took
a
betting
man's
risk.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
right,
that
would
happen.
but
that
property
he
gave
away
would
never
be
taxed
by
the
united
states
under
any
circumstances.
so
what
really
happened
here
is
the
decedent
took
a
bit
of
a
gamble
and
lost.
but
at
this
court
held
in
united
states
and
manufacturers
national
bank
at
363
u.s.
201,
the
executor
should
not
complain
because
his
decedent
gambled
and
lost.
