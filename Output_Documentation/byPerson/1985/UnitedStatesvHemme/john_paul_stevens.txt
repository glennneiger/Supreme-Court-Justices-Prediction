justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you
do,
because
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand.
i'm
not
100
percent
i
do.
you
argue
that
he's
better
off
under
the
new
law
than
if
the
law
had
never
been
passed,
as
i
understand
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
combining
him
and
the
estate
as
one
for
the
moment.
as
i
understand
your
argument...
see
if
i
state
it
correctly,
because
it's
awfully
easy
to
get
confused...
under
the
old
law
he
would
have
paid
no
gift
tax,
but
the
amount
of
the
gifts
would
have
been
included
in
his
estate
tax
and
he
would
have
paid
an
estate
tax
on
that
amount
that
would
have
been
included.
and
that
tax
would
have
been
higher
than
under
the
new
law
where
he
got
a
$28,000
exemption
or
credit
against
the
tax
as
to
both
of
them,
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
net
result
is
he
pays
less
tax,
he
and
his
estate
together
pay
less
tax,
than
would
have
been
paid,
because
he
paid
no
gift
tax
before
and
the
estate
tax
would
have
been
higher?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he's
better
off
than
if
the
law
had
never
been
passed.
but
in
both
cases,
assuming
that
these
were
gifts
in
contemplation
of
death.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
do
you
agree
with
the
first
submission
that
the
government
makes,
that
if
the
statute
had
never
been
passed
and
if
he
died
within
the
three
year
period,
he
and
the
estate
together
would
have
paid
a
larger
tax
than
they
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
say
that
what
you're
really
saying
is
you
didn't
get
as
much
of
a
benefit
out
of
the
new
law
as
if
the
arrangement
had
been
a
little
different.
but
is
it
not
true
that
the
net
result
of
the
new
law
is
to
impose
a
lesser
total
tax
on
the
donor
and
the
estate
that
would
have
been
the
case
had
the
same
facts
occurred
and
no
new
statute
ever
been
passed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
it's
also
true,
is
it
not,
under
the
old
law
that
if
the
donor
had
lived
more
than
three
years
he
would
have
been
discriminated
against?
you
have
the
same
difference.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
the
gift
then
wouldn't
have
been
included
in
the
estate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
you
don't
get
the
credit
because
you
took
the
exemption.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
i'm
suggesting
is
the
harm,
the
differentiation
between
the
person
who
dies
within
three
years
of
the
gift
and
one
who
dies
more
than
three
years
later,
was
true
under
the
old
law
and
is
true
under
the
new
law.
both
of
them
suffer
by
reason
of
their
premature
death.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
wouldn't
have
been
a
similarly
situated
taxpayer.
that's
my
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
call
a
taxpayer
who
dies
within
the
three
years
similarly
situated
to
one
who
dies
later,
then
you're
absolutely
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
on
that
point?
supposing
congress
were
to
make
the
period
measuring
a
gift
in
contemplation
of
death
four
years
instead
of
three
years.
could
they
do
that
and
have
that
apply
to
gifts
that
had
been
made
during
the
last
year
or
two?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i'm
not
suggesting
changing
rates.
changing
the
date.
in
other
words,
in
this
case
if
they
extended
the
period
a
year
and
he
had
died
a
year
later,
it
would
still
be
in
contemplation
of
death.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
also
makes
a
judgment
about
how
long
he's
apt
to
live,
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
he
had
real
good
reason
to
figure
he'd
live,
say,
three
and
a
half
years,
so
he
said
he's
go
ahead
and
do
it,
and
then
congress
changed
the
rules
on
him
and
made
it
four
years
instead
of
three,
he
would
have
been
cheated
in
exactly
the
same
way
that
you
described.
justice
john
paul
stevens
see,
in
both
cases
the
liability
would
be
determined
on
the
basis
of
events
that
had
occurred
without
regard
to
the
amendment.
i
forget
how
you
phrased
the
test.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
more
question.
is
the
net
result
of
the
district
court
judgment
that
you
got
$6,000,
a
refund
in
effect?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that's
the
amount
in
dispute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
think
of
how
many
lawyers
would
have
been
here
if
it
was
$600,000.
