justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
herrmann,
as
i
understand
it,
massachusetts
is
claiming
ancient
title
as
the
theory
of
its
recovery?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
don't
know
that
this
court
has
ever
recognized
ancient
title
as
a
theory
of
recovery
as
such.
it
has
had
cases
dealing
with
historic
title,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
what
you
think
the
elements
are
for
establishment
of
ancient
title,
and
whether
you
think
there
are
any
cases
from
this
court
that
would
support
the
application
of
that
theory
as
opposed
to
normal
principles
of
historic
title.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
herrmann,
do
you
think
that
title
acquired
in
that
fashion
can
be
abandoned
by
the
states?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there's
no
problem
here,
because
if
the
state
doesn't
have
it
the
united
states
does.
there's
no
lapse
in
title,
and
if
abandonment
is
possible
i
must
say
it's
hard
for
me
to
understand
why
the
legislative
acts
of
disclaimer
by
massachusetts
and
the
publication
of
its
official
charts
don't
reflect
abandonment
by
the
state
of
massachusetts.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
claiborne,
it
seems
to
me
that
what
massachusetts
is
claiming
is
something
under
a
so-called
doctrine
of
ancient
title
on
the
theory
that
under
that
doctrine
it
in
fact
acquired
title
in
colonial
times
regardless
of
what
its
claims
were
since.
do
you
concede
that
there
is
such
a
doctrine
as
ancient
title
which
we
would
follow
if
the
elements
are
established?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
not
very
helpful.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right,
but
if
massachusetts
is
correct
that
it
acquired
ancient
title
at
one
time,
and
if
you
are
correct
that
it
was
abandoned
later
by
massachusetts
at
a
time
when
the
united
states
was
not
claiming
it,
does
that
mean
that
the
title
then
passed
to
international
usage
and
the
boundaries
of
the
united
states
were
altered,
at
the
time
of
any
abandonment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
claiborne,
if
you
look
at
page
51
of
the
master's
report,
at
the
end
of
the
paragraph,
the
one
over
paragraph
at
the
top,
the
master
says,
"massashusetts
can
establish
an
ancient
title
to
nantucket
sound
only
if
the
supreme
court
holds
that
the
clear
beyond
doubt
standard
is
inappropriate
in
this
proceeding.
"
then
he
starts
his
section
2,
the
history
of
historical
geography,
which
begins
with
the
explanation
that
as
an
independent
basis
for
its
claim
massachusetts
argues
that
even
if
that
title
didn't
pass
under
the
royal
charters
or
as
a
result
of
the
doctrine
of
inter
fauces
terra,
massachusetts
nevertheless
has
title
by
virtue
of
history
and
usage.
so,
i
concluded,
frankly,
in
reading
his
report
that
the
language
back
on
page
65
was
a
resolution
of
this
historical
claim
of
continuous
occupation
and
that
he
had
dealt
with
the
ancient
title
claim
in
the
language
that
i
read
to
you
in
the
middle
of
page
51.
