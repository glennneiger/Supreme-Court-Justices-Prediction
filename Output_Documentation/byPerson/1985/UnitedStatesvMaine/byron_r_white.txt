what
is
a
state
ocean
sanctuary?
what
is
that,
a
state
ocean
sanctuary?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
clairborne,
did
you
file
exceptions
to
the
special
master's
report?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
sounds
to
me
like
your
argument
so
far
is
in
the
teeth
of
some
of
the
things
the
special
master
seemed
to
say.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
said
that
massachusetts
wins
unless
the
clear
and
convincing
evidence
standard
applies.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
this
all
about
historic
title?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
conclusion
on
page...
the
carry-over
sentence
at
65
and
66?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
does
it
ever...
where
does
this
section
mention
ancient
title?
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe
the
only
evidence
it
has
it
that
there
was
a
title
to
which
it
fell
heir
to,
and
i
know
you
dispute
that
but
do
you
think
it
then
has
to
assert
title
and
continuously
assert
title?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
do
you
occupy
nantucket
sound?
justice
byron
r.
white
--that
would
make
a
whole
lot
of
sense
with
the
final
sentence
of
the
paragraph.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
claiborne,
under
d-1,
vineyard
sound,
the
first
sentence
says,
he
concludes
that
there
is
historic
title
to
that.
then
he
goes
through
and
discusses
why
they
have
historic
title,
and
then
nantucket
sound,
it
talks
about
historic
title.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
assumes
that--
justice
byron
r.
white
--his
finding
is,
but
that...
you
want
to
say
that
the
lapse
idea
applies
to
ancient
title
as
well
as
to
historic
title?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
read
page
51
as
the
end
of
the
discussion
of
ancient
title,
it's
a
strange
posture
to
leave
the
case
in
if
the
master
thought
that
ancient
title
had
lapsed.
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
what
standard
of
proof
there
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
going
to
argue
the
standard
of
proof?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
saying
you
concede
that
the
state
may
do
that
if
it
is
proved
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
it
had...
or
beyond
that
evidence,
that
it
had
ancient
title?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
it
urged
by
the
united
states
before
the
special
master
that
the
notion
of
lapse
did
apply
to
ancient
title?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
the
master
do
with
that
claim?
what
did--
justice
byron
r.
white
--why
did
he
leave
us
with
this
circular
statement
on
page
51?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
just
saying
it
must
be...
that's
unfair,
that's
about
your
submission,
that
would
just
be
unfair?
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
think
the
united
states
has
the
power
to
disclaim
it
at
that
point,
in
fact
it
has
the
power
at
any
other
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
say
if
the
disclaimer
had
been
ten
years
before
this
case
began?
what
would
you
say
about
your
standard
of
proof?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean,
the
beyond
doubt
standard
applies?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
think
the
special
master
read
our
cases
completely
inaccurately
about
the
standard?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
relied
on
it.
he
said
that,
you
haven't
proved
it
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
