mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
i
may
turn
from
legal
theory
to
the
geographical
and
historical
facts
appurtenant
to
nantucket
sound
for
a
moment,
it
may
be
helpful
to
the
court.
i
invite
the
court
first
to
look
at
the
chart
which
is
appended
to
the
massachusetts
exception,
simply
to
have
a
visual
picture
of
the
area
we're
talking
about
in
a
more
precise
way.
it
seems
to
us
that
when
you
look
at
that
map
and
you
look
at
nantucket
island,
what
you
see
is
an
island
in
the
sea,
not
a
bay,
not
an
extra
mouth
to
an
inlet,
but
an
island
around
which
there
is
a
strait.
there's
a
strait
from
the
eastern
entrance
to
nantucket
sound
between
vineyard
and
nantucket
sound,
and
there's
another
strait
which
is
indeed
well
marked
navigation
channel
going
from
the
eastern
entrance
to
nantucket
sound
through
the
sound
and
out
vineyard
sound,
a
deep,
marked
navigation
channel
from
one
open
sea
to
another
open
sea.
now,
i
suggest
that
that
configuration
has
never
been
found
to
constitute
inland
water
by
ancient
title,
by
historic
title,
by
juridic
title,
at
any
time
except
only
during
the
exaggerated
period
of
the
stuarts
which
everyone
agrees
cannot
be
relied
on
in
this
or
any
other
case,
because
repudiated
by
england
itself
long
before
the
american
revolution,
or
alternatively,
in
modern
times
under
the
straight
base
line
system
used
in
the
norwegian
case
and
condoned
by
the
international
convention
under
article
4,
but
a
procedure,
a
method
which
the
united
states
has
at
all
times
declined
to
follow
and
which
this
court
has
determined
is
a
matter
for
the
government
of
the
united
states
to
determine
and
not
for
the
court
to
review.
this
configuration
is
wholly
unlike
all
examples
that
are
mentioned
in
the
briefs
and
in
the
report
in
this
case.
it
is
not
like
delaware
bay
or
chesapeake
bay
or
boston
harbor
or
buzzards
bay
or
long
island
sound,
all
of
which
are
clear,
deep
indentations
into
the
mainland,
nor
is
it
like
mississippi
sound
and
chandelier
sound
which
this
court
has
characterized
as
cul-de-sacs,
dead
ends,
not
a
straight
in
and
out.
despite
the
fact
that
this
case
has
been
proceeding
at
its
usual
slow
pace
for
many
years,
despite
the
fact
that
this
question
of
whether
a
configuration
of
this
kind
can
qualify
as
inland,
massachusetts
has
to
this
day
never
suggested
that
english
law
or
american
law
has
at
any
time
characterized
such
a
like
body
of
water
elsewhere
as
inland.
that
seems
to
us
a
rather
telling
failure.
now,
turning
from
geography
to
history,
we
are
told
that
the
sound
was
discovered
in
1602
and
yet
from
that
day
until
1971
there
was
not
any
specific
claim
to
this
sound
by
anyone
in
the
government
in
those
three
and
a
half
and
more
centuries.
no
agency
of
government,
legislative,
executive
or
judicial,
whether
of
the
crown
of
england,
the
colony
of
massachusetts,
the
independent
commonwealth,
the
state
of
the
union
or
the
united
states
in
all
that
time
mentions
or
claims
the
interior
center
of
nantucket
sound
as
inland
water.
the
only
suggestion
that
there
might
be
such
a
claim
is
with
respect
to
a
1932
statute
which
prohibits
trolling
within
the
sound.
we
do
not
read
that
statute
as
claiming
jurisdiction
over
the
center
of
the
sound
because
it
refers
to
a
three-mile
belt
in
on
of
its
provisions.
it
seems
to
us,
quite
logically
to
me,
we're
claiming
jurisdiction
over
so
much
of
the
sound
as
is
within
three
miles
of
any
shore.
but
at
all
events,
even
if
we
misread
the
statute,
this
court
has
squarely
held
in
the
alaska
case
reported
in
volume
422
of
the
united
states
reports,
that
a
claim
to
fishery
regulation
is
not
sufficient
to
establish
an
accession
of
sovereignty
as
inland
water,
and
therefore
fishery
regulation
would
not
suffice.
now,
in
the
hundreds
of
documents
introduced
in
this
case,
spanning
more
than
three
centuries,
we
don't
have
a
single
one
that
reflects
an
expressed
accession
of
of
jurisdiction
as
inland
water
over
the
center
of
the
sound.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
justice
o'connor,
i
have
to
say
yes
and
no.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
will
attempt
to
explain.
yes,
in
that
we
recognize
that
there
can
indeed
be
a
perfected
legal
title
obtained
at
a
time
when
the
law
was
different,
which
may
survive
as
a
historic
waters
claim
through
the
intervening
change
of
law,
provided
that
first
the
establishment
of
that
old
title
is
clear
and
secondly
that
it
was
continually
asserted
rather
than
clearly
abandoned,
as
was
the
case
here,
in
the
intervening
time.
and,
if
that
is
what
is
meant
by
ancient
title,
we
have
no
quarrel.
to
the
extent
that
massachusetts
asserts
that
there
is
some
doctrine
which
requires
less
occupation,
less
accession
of
sovereignty,
and
which
is
almost
never
found
to
have
lapsed
or
been
abandoned
despite
very
clear,
unequivocal
statements
of
repudiation,
we
deny
that
such
a
doctrine
exists
and
secondly
that
it
has
ever
been
recognized
by
this
court.
i
may
say
that
manchester
versus
massachusetts
sees
no
such
example.
the
court
there
found
that
with
respect
to
buzzards
bay
where
the
opening
is
less
than
six
miles,
it
met
all
the
requirements
of
then
international
law
and
national
law.
what
is
more,
it
was
expressly
closed
in
that
way
by
massachusetts
legislative
declaration
of
1881
which
had
been
implemented
and
by
a
map
introduced
in
the
case
in
this
court
which
showed
the
closure,
nothing
whatever
reliance
on
ancient
times.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
justice
o'connor,
if
one
assumes,
contrary
to
our
argument
that
there
ever
was
a
perfected
claim
or
perfected
ancient
title,
and
that
that
title
survived
until...
or
through
the
period
when
the
united
states
became
a
sovereign
nation,
then
what
your
honor
suggests
could
indeed
be
the
result,
but
it
was
open
to
the
united
states
to
reclaim
that
area
as
it
did
with
respect
to
the
resources
of
the
seabed
in
the
truman
proclamation
of
1945,
and
as
it
has
with
respect
to
fisheries
in
other
legislation,
and
as
it
could
with
respect
to
all
jurisdiction
by
adopting
a
different
limit
than
the
three-mile
limit
as
it
is
free
to
do,
or
by
using
a
straight
base
line
method
which
as
a
matter
of
international
law
it
is
free
to
do.
so,
there
is
no
difficulty
in
the
fact
that
the
disclaimer
by
massachusetts
might
have,
for
a
period,
subject
to
the
united
states'
ability
to
repair
it,
momentarily
the
boundaries
of
the
united
states.
but
i
must
confess
that
we
do
not
concede
that
such
ancient
title
ever
was
perfected
and
it's
all
very
well
to
say
that
this
area
was
discovered
in
1603
but
beyond
that,
massachusetts
has
shown
nothing
by
way
of
a
paper...
in
colonial
times
or
since,
nor
has
it
shown
any
governmental
acts
which
would
amount
to
effective
occupation
of
the
area.
the
only
evidence
in
the
case
with
respect
to
any
activity
here,
there's
no
arrest,
there's
no
warning
of
vessels,
there's
no
marking
of
the
area,
absolutely
nothing
by
any
government.
all
we
have
is
a
quite
natural,
usual,
traditional
exploitation
of
the
resources
of
the
sound
by
the
people
who
live
on
the
coast.
that
happens
on
every
coast,
and
here
it
happened
on
the
ocean
side
of
the
nantucket
island
just
as
it
did
on
the
inland
side,
that
is,
on
the
northern
side.
it
proves
nothing,
but
the
people
who
live
there
naturally
took
advantage
of
the
whaling,
the
sailmaking,
the
fishing
and
the
shellfish
life
accessible
to
them
from
where
they
lived.
that
is
no
governmental
assertion
of--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--there
is
one
such
instance
involving,
as
mr.
herrmann
correctly
said,
the
fisheries
off
ceylon
in
which
according
to
judge
jessup,
that
particular
area
has
been
consistently
since
a
period
b.c.,
been
exploited
by
the
people
of
ceylon
at
a
time
when
the
difference
between
governmental
and
non-governmental
activity
may
have
been
less
clear
than
it
is
today.
but,
that
is
a
very
ancient
title,
immemorial
usage,
and
continuous
one,
very
much
to
be
contrasted
with
here.
no
precise
claim,
even
on
paper,
and
no
activity
whatever
by
anybody
except
the
local
inhabitants
who
quite
naturally
took
advantage
of
what
is
available
to
them.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
again,
your
honor,
i
must
say
yes
and
no.
it
is--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--we
don't
read
it
that
way,
your
honor.
we
read
judge
hoffman
to
have
said
that
massachusetts
has
established
an
ancient
title,
not
necessarily
one
still
good,
if
the
clear
beyond
doubt
standard
does
not
apply.
but
then,
we
read
his
evaluation
of
the
evidence
which
is
the
title
of
the
chapter,
evaluation
of
the
massachusetts
claim,
beginning
at
page
61.
when
you
get
to
page
64
and
the
judge
focuses
on
nantucket
sound
in
particular
he
quite
clearly
in
our
view
finds
the
facts
to
be
that
massachusetts
has
failed
to
prove
the
existence
of
an
actual
intent
to
establish
jurisdiction
over
nantucket
sound,
never
mind
by
what
title.
64,
just
below
the
middle
of
the
page...
"it
is
therefore
the
special
master's
opinion
that
the
commonwealth
has
failed
to
establish
that
either
the
united
states
or
massachusetts
ever
asserted
jurisdiction
over
the
sound
until
massachusetts
did
so
relatively
recently.
"
turning
to
the
next
page,
on
page
65
of
the
report,
the
master
says,
"it
is
unlikely
that
post-colonial
massachusetts
ever
claimed
the
interior
of
nantucket
sound.
"
"further,
nor
has
massachusetts
presented
an
other
evidence
that
it
had
laid
claim
to
the
sound
during
the
first
half
of
the
19th
century.
"
and
continuing,
"during
the
second
half
of
the
century
massachusetts
abandoned
the
inter
fauces
terrae
doctrine
to
delimit
its
seaward
boundaries,
substituting
a
strict
distance
test.
"
"under
this
test,
massachusetts
claimed
only
those
arms
of
the
sea
whose
mouths
were
six
nautical
miles
or
less
in
width.
"
"nantucket
sound
clearly
does
not
meet
this
criterion.
"
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
not,
your
honor.
first,
the
scheme
of
the
report
was
such
that
this
entire
section
is
the
conclusion
of
everything
that
goes
before
it.
this
is
section
d,
beginning
at
page
61,
evaluation
of
the
massachusetts
claim.
this
follows,
after
we've
had
in
the
previous
section
a
detail
of
the
evidence.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
"the
special
master
therefore
concludes
that
massachusetts
has
failed
to
meet
its
burden
of
establishing
historic
title
to
nantucket
sound.
"
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
doesn't,
your
honor,
but
it
mentions
the
evidence
which
would
be
common
to
both,
and
it
seems
to
us,
he
had
used
the
expression
7
of
the
convention
but
there
is
no
getting
round
the
express
and
unequivocal
finding
that
massachusetts
has
presented
no
evidence
of
an
assertion
of
sovereignty,
and
on
the
contrary
that
its
own
evidence
proves
that
it
disclaimed--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--well,
the
title...
even
according
to
the
juridical
regime...
the
only
authority
i
may
say,
on
which
the
commonwealth
appears
to
clearly
rely,
the
elements
of
ancient
title
are
that
there
be
a
discovery
of
an
area
which
is
not
yet
appropriated
for
the
general
community
by
the
doctrine
of
open
seas,
that
there
be
effective
occupation
of
that
area,
not
merely
a
supposition
that
some
charter
may
or
may
not
by
generally
talking
about
waters--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--well,
in
the
same
way
that
you
would
to
prove
historic
title,
by
marking
it,
by
legislating
about
it,
by
deterring
or
preventing
foreign
vessels
from
entering
it,
and
by
exploiting,
by
license
from
the
government,
the
resources
of
the
area.
none
of
that,
nothing
approaching
that,
is
shown
here.
and
finally,
the
juridical
regime
says
that
ancient
title
must
be
fortified
by
long
usage,
an
element
which
has
not
been
mentioned
but
which
is
stated.
and
so
it
comes
to
this,
that
ancient
title
is
different
from
historic
title
only
in
that
it
is
not
originally
a
title
founded
on
prescription
adverse
to
the
claims
of
the
general
community,
but
it
must
be
established
in
some
way
that
is
notorious
to
the
world
community
and
it
must
be
preserved
by
usage,
and
certainly
cannot
survive
the
express
disclaimer
which
there
is
no
getting
around
massachusetts
engaged
in,
first
in
1849
when
it
declared
that
henceforward
its
boundaries
would
be
those
bodies
of
water
as
to
which
a
closure
no
more
than
six
miles
was
available.
that
does
meet
the
test
in
nantucket
sound
where
the
eastern
closure
is
over
nine
miles
in
width.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
or
because
it
lacks.
and
we
didn't
invent
the
word
"lacks".
it
is
the
master
who
says,
and
this
is...
perhaps
i
should
have
answered
justice
white
in
this
way,
the
bottom
of
page
<sixty-five>
[=
65],
it
seems
to
me,
does
refer
to
the
colonial
title.
it
says,
the
last
sentence,
last
full
sentence
on
that
page,
"therefore,
whatever
rights
it
may
have
had
over
nantucket
sound
during
the
colonial
period.
"
now,
that's
got
to
be
a
reference
to
the
so-called
ancient
title,
"lapsed
until
the
commonwealth's
attempt
to
resuscitate--
"
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--yes,
your
honor.
the
expression
"historic
title",
after
all,
is
very
close
to
the
"historic
waters"
which
is
the
term
this
court
and
the
international
convention
have
both
used.
and
of
course
an
ancient
title
is
a
historic
title.
it's
one
based
on
history.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
justice
o'connor,
i
must
confess
that
the
report
seems
to
us,
as
to
others,
less
than
absolutely
clear.
i
think
the
only
way
you
can
reconcile
it
is
to
read
the
passage
which
your
honor
referred
to
on
page
51
as
meaning
that
the
perfection
of
the
ancient
title
has
not
been
shown
if
the
clear
beyond
doubt
standard
is
applicable
without
prejudice
to
the
second
question,
whether
that
title,
if
effected,
survived.
and,
that
second
question
is
dealt
with
under
the
general
heading,
in
subpart
d,
i
think,
repeating,
is
not
a
discrete
discussion
of
historic
title.
it's
a
genuine
discussion
of
the
entire
massachusetts
claim.
it
doesn't
say
evaluation
of
the
massachusetts
historic
claim,
but
the
whole
of
it.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
however
one
reads
the
master's
report,
it
does
seem
to
us
that
the
master
has
made
a
finding,
on
page
65,
that
whatever
rights
over
nantucket
sound
accrued
during
the
colonial
period,
which
he
suggests
were
none
but
whatever
they
might
have
been,
have
long
since
lapsed
by
renunciation.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
finding
may
in
the
master's
mind
not
be
relevant
to
ancient
title.
we
say,
whatever
he
might
have
thought
about
that,
his
finding
is
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it's
professed
by...
it's
conceded
by
massachusetts
that
ancient
title
can
be
lost,
and
since
ancient
title
requires
to
be
fortified
by
long
usage,
it
must
follow
that
it
is
lost
by
non-usage
and
all
the
more
so
by
express
disclaimer.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
one
can
argue
that
the
rest
of
the
report
is
superfluous
if
massachusetts
has
proved
ancient
title.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
with
respect
to
the
standard
of
proof,
we
submit
that
this
court
has
very
clearly,
and
that
its
masters
have
followed
what
seemed
to
them
the
clear
lead
of
the
court,
and
that
the
court
has
approved
the
masters'
report,
to
the
effect
that
when
the
united
states
in
its
sovereign
decision
disclaims
an
area
never
mind
when
it
disclaims
it,
it
is
going
to
be
ineffective
if
it
comes
too
late
in
the
sense
that
it's
not
dispositive,
but
it
at
least
has
this
effect,
so
the
court
has
said,
which
is
to
require
the
state
to
prove
that
its
historic
claim,
and
that
should
apply
whether
it's
an
ancient
title
or
a
so-called
historic
title,
is
quite
clear
and
that
it
is
therefore
quite
wrong
and
unfair
for
the
united
states
to
come
in
so
late
and
attempt
to
defeat
it.
and
that
much
is
due
to
the
decision
that
the
united
states,
to
define
its
borders
in
a
certain
way.
it
seems
to
us
that,
as
it
did
to
the
master
here,
that
this
court
has
quite
clearly
fixed
that
standard
when
there
is
a
disclaimer,
and
here
there
is
a
disclaimer,
no
question
about
the
fact
that
the
united
states
is
and
has
disclaimed
title
to
nantucket
sound
or
to
the
center
of
it.
that
disclaimer
may
or
may
not
be
belated,
but
it
does
at
least
require
that
the
states
proof
be
at
a
higher
standard,
and
that
is
not
an
extraordinary
proposition.
indeed,
what
is
extraordinary
is
that
the
united
states
isn't
free
to
fix
its
boundaries
like
every
other
nation.
it's
only
the
oddity
of
our
federal
system,
nothing
to
do
with
international
law,
and
one
can't
look
to
international
law
for
this,
that
permits
a
state
to
claim
adversely
to
the--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--and
indeed,
that
we
don't
dispute
and
we
must
concede
that
the
court
has...
but
a
standard
seems
to
us
as
we
explain
in
the
last
section
of
our
brief,
to
be
that
clear.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
your
honor,
we
probably
didn't
use
the
word
"lapse",
but
we
very
clearly
pointed
out
and
argued
at
great
length
that
massachusetts
had
itself
disclaimed
through
the
adoption
judicially
of
a
test
that
wouldn't
close
nantucket
sound,
and
mainly
through
the
legislative--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--he
seems
to
us,
on
pages
64
and
65,
to
have
agreed
with
us
entirely
that
the--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--i
can
only
repeat
that
it
seems
to
us
that
what
occurs
on
page
51
is
a
step
in
the
process
and
not
a
final
conclusion
with
respect
to
the
survival
of
ancient
title.
it's
a
statement
with
respect
to
the
vesting
of
title
back
in
the
colonial
days,
and
then
the
ultimate
conclusion
is,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it
did
or
didn't
because
in
any
event
it
has
been
disclaimed.
we
also
pointed
out
that
the
united
states
had
repudiated
or
contested
or
denied
any
title
to
nantucket
sound
as
the
master
himself
finds
on
pages
64
and
65
on
which
he
says,
"neither
the
united
states
nor
the
state
of
massachusetts.
"
--never
mind
the
colony
of
massachusetts...
"at
any
time
appears
to
have
claimed
the
center
of
nantucket
sound.
"
he
says
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
and
whether
he's
thinking
in
terms
of
ancient
title
or
not,
that
finding,
it
seems
to
us,
is
beyond
doubt
and
indeed
it's
stated
unequivocally.
it's
not
stated
as
an
issue.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
wouldn't
have
thought
so,
justice
blackmun.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
would
not.
