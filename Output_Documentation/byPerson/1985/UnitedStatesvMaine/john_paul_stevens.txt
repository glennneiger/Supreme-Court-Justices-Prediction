justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
you,
general
herrmann.
i
didn't
understand...
i
think
justice
o'connor
asked
you
about
ancient
title
and
asked
you
if
there
are
cases,
and
you
gave
us
the
citation
of
one
of
them,
but
then
you
were
going
to
tell
us
the
elements
of
ancient
title,
or
have
you
done
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
clarify
one
thing.
what
do
you
mean
by
"occupation",
that
element
of
the
claim,
when
you're
talking
about
this
area
of
water
that
we're
talking
about
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
claiborne,
he
cited
a
couple
of
cases
that
said,
as
i
understood
him,
sedentary
fishing
can
constitute
occupation,
or
something
to
that
effect.
are
there
such
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
you
just
for
a
moment.
you
are
referring
to
the
two
different
parts
of
the
master's
report,
which
i
must
confess
i
am
a
little
confused
by.
are
you
in
effect
arguing
that
the
burden
of
proof
issue
that
your
opponent
relies
on
is
really
an
alternative
ground
for
decision,
that
in
the
early
part
of
the
opinion
you
are
saying
that
the
burden
of
proof
can
resolve
the
question
of
whether
the
doctrine
of
inter
fauces
terrae
applies,
and
he
falls
short
because
it's
not
clear
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
but
then
later
on
64
and
65
he's
saying
that
even
if
the
doctrine
were
to
apply
it
still
fails
because
they
didn't
assert
jurisdiction--
