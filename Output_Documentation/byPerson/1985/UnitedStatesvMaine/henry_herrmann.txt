mr.
henry
herrmann
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
an
action
to
quiet
title
brought
by
the
united
states
of
america
against
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts.
the
area
in
controversy
is
a
body
of
coastal
water
off
the
coast
of
massachusetts
known
as
nantucket
sound.
the
charts
appended
to
both
the
massachusetts
brief
in
support
of
its
exception
and
the
united
states
reply
brief,
both
those
charts
indicate
the
configuration
and
location
of
nantucket
sound.
they
further
indicate
the
precise
nature
of
the
controversy
on
the
ground.
massachusetts
claims
that
the
entirety
of
nantucket
sound
is
state,
and
therefore
united
states
inland
waters
and
that
massachusetts
is
the
owner
of
the
seabed
thereof.
the
united
states,
as
the
chart
appended
to
its
brief
shows,
it
claims
a
small,
what
one
can
call
a
small
federal
enclave
in
the
center
of
the
sound
with
a
narrow
passageway
leading
thereto
from
the
open
ocean.
this
case
at
its
present
state
of
the
proceeding
involves
only
nantucket
sound.
other
areas
in
controversy
have
so
far
been
disposed
of,
and
the
present
stage
of
the
proceedings
are
before
the
court
on
the
report
of
its
special
master
and
on
the
sole
exception
taken
by
massachusetts.
this
exception
by
massachusetts
is
somewhat
unusual
for
two
reasons.
first,
this
is
not
the
type
of
submerged
land
or
marine
boundary
case
as
the
court
has
heard
many
in
the
past,
where
the
state
and
the
federal
government
are
fighting
for
a
small
area
of
land
because
of
the
king's
ransom
in
oil
royalties
that
they
portend.
under
massachusetts
state
law,
which
has
been
in
existence
for
a
long
time,
nantucket
sound
is
designated
a
state
ocean
sanctuary
and
massachusetts
wishes
to
preserve
its
state
protection
which
is
absolutely--
mr.
henry
herrmann
--under
chapter
132-a,
sections
14
and
15
of
the
massachusetts
general
laws,
your
honor,
the
state
has
designated
certain
particularly
important
or
ecologically
or
scenically
unique
areas
of
its
coast
as
so-called
ocean
sanctuaries,
and
those
cannot
be
changed
or
altered
in
any
way
by
exploitation,
advertising.
there
can
be
no
change
in
the
water.
there
can
be
no
degradation
of
the
seabed,
no
erection
of
structures,
no
waste
disposal.
in
other
words,
the
statutory
scheme
is
to
preserve
the
status
quo,
the
pristine
beauty
of
this
area,
absolutely
for
all
time.
that
is
the
gist
of
such
a
designation,
your
honor.
that
is
the
first--
mr.
henry
herrmann
--yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
henry
herrmann
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
there
are
two
parts
to
that
question.
let
me
take
the
second
one
first.
i
think
there
is
indeed
solid
precedent
from
the
decisions
of
this
court...
if
i
may
refer
the
court
to
manchester
versus
massachusetts,
decided
in
1981,
there
the
court
had
before
it
a
controversy
as
to
the
status
of
buzzards
bay,
which
if
i
can
again...
if
i
may
refer
the
court
to
the
charts
appended
to
either
of
the
briefs,
you
will
see
that
buzzards
bay
is
one
of
the
semi-contiguous
bodies
of
water
to
nantucket
sound.
first
you
have
nantucket
sound,
and
eastward
of
that
you
have
vineyard
sound
and
then
eastward
of
that
you
have
buzzards
bay.
well,
as
to
the
famous...
and
it
is
a
famous
case,
it's
been
discussed
by
almost
all
the
international
publicists
at
length,
as
to
the
buzzards
bay
case
in
1981...
interestingly
enough,
this
court
said
very
succinctly,
without
equivocation,
"it
is
clear",
said
the
court,
"that
massachusetts
is
the
owner,
that
it
has
buzzards
bay
by
virtue
of
its
province
charter.
"
now,
i
ask
the
court
for
a
moment
to
ponder
the
implications
of
that.
how
could
that
be
anything
but
what
we
today
under
modern
international
law
parlance,
as
it
has
been,
for
example,
been
expressed
by
the
u.n.
study,
the
juridical
water
study,
in
paragraph
71
thereof
which
we
quote,
what
else
could
that
mean
but
an
ancient
title?
to
support
that
finding
and
that
holding
by
the
court,
the
king
of
england
had
to
have
gained
it
in
the
first
place,
if
massachusetts
got
it
from
the
crown.
how
could
the
king
of
england
have
gained
it?
he
could
only
under
then
prevailing
international
law
have
gained
buzzards
bay
and
the
surrounding
lands
by
initial
discovery
which
was
at
that
time,
as
was
also
held
by
this
court
in
martin
versus
waddell,
the
accepted
way
of
gaining
title
over
newly
discovered
land,
to
just
discover
it.
the
title
was
then
fortified
by
occupation,
through
the
settlements
in
the
colonial
times.
then,
that
is
how
title
vested
in
the
crown.
the
crown
then
passed
the
title,
as
it
had
the
right
to
do
under
british
law,
and
that's
unquestioned
today
as
it
was
then.
the
crown
gave
title
to
these
lands
and
these
subsoils
in
buzzards
bay
as
it
has,
we
claim,
in
nantucket
sound,
to
its
colony,
to
the
province
of
massachusetts.
that
is
the
1691
charter.
that's
the
one
referred
to
100
years
ago
by
this
court,
and
that's
precisely
the
charter
that
the
special
master
in
this
case
said
was
operative
in
granting
us
nantucket
sound.
mr.
henry
herrmann
theoretically,
yes,
your
honor,
but
our
position
is,
we
have
briefed
that,
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
again,
while
in
theory
it
could
be
abandoned,
in
practice
prevailing
international
law
imposes
extremely
strict
provisions,
how
that
must
occur,
and
if
those
provisions
are
not
met
the
theory
of
lapse
or
abandonment
of
an
already
perfected
title,
and
may
i
just
address
that
distinction,
what
the
master
was
talking
about
and
what
i
think
your
honor
is
talking
about
is,
once
a
title
is
perfected
can
it
be
abandoned
or
can
it
lapse.
what
the
master
was
talking
about
later
in
the
discussion,
and
what
the
government
is
focusing
on
is...
was
a
so-called
historic
title
ever
acquired.
but
as
to
the
perfected
ancient
title
which
was
now
perfected
in
colonial
times,
no
i
would
say
in
theory
yes,
but
it
is
quite
clear
that
international
law,
both
by
the
courts
and
the
publicists,
this
so-called
active
abandonment
theory
is
definitely
in
disfavor.
it's
in
disfavor
because
it
leads
to
instability
of
international
titles
and
possible
international
tensions.
mr.
henry
herrmann
your
honor,
i
don't
think...
i
submit
that
they
do
not
reflect
abandonment
by
massachusetts
for
the
following
reasons.
if
your
honor's
referring
to
the
late
19th
century
charts
that
were
published
by
the
harbor
and
land
commissioners,
those
were
published
upon
the
mandate
of
the
massachusetts
legislature,
leading
back
to
an
1859
statute
by
the
legislature.
just
like
the
british
territorial
waters
jurisdiction
act,
both
those
statutes
were
passed
as
an
almost
emergency
measure
to
cure
the
problem
that
apparently
there
was
no
criminal
jurisdiction
in
the
open
water,
on
the
seacoast.
the
problem
was
quickly...
very
quickly,
because
of
two
cases
that
involved
the
inability
to
prosecute
a
criminal,
so
the
legislature
almost
on
an
emergency
basis
extended
its
jurisdiction
seaward.
so,
the
first
thing
is
they
had
no
intent,
and
mahler
versus
transportation
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
deals
with
that
problem
so
there
should
be
no
inference
that
a
state...
a
legislature
is
abandoning
a
state
seabed
unless
they
expressly
say
so.
the
purpose
of
that
legislation
was
not
to
abandon
territory
already
vested
in
the
state.
its
purpose
was
purely
one
to
extend
on
an
emergency
basis,
curial
jurisdiction
for
criminal
purposes.
that's
point
one.
point
two
is
that
if
you
look,
as
i
think
one
must,
at
the
state
statute
and
the
large-scale
charts
of
1891...
i'm
sorry,
1883,
you
look
at
them
together
because
they
are
a
unitary
manifestation.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
the
charts
are
ambiguous.
they
do
not
show
an
intent
to
abandon
nantucket
sound
with...
not
specificity
as
is
required
under
international
law.
why?
because
if
nantucket
sound
had
been
high
seas,
as
the
government
contends,
there
would
have
had
to
have
been
a
closing
line
between
vineyard
sound,
clearly,
and
nantucket
sound.
that
is
exhibit
4
of
massachusetts
exhibits,
your
honor,
as
we
have
referred
to
it
in
your
brief.
it
is
clear
that
the
harbor
and
land
commissioners
had
a
great
deal
of
problem
reconciling
that
criminal
jurisdiction
statute
and
what
they
perceived
to
be
the
actual
status
of
nantucket
sound,
which
was
not
high
seas.
finally,
your
honor,
i
would
ask
you
to
consider
the
following
point.
i
submit
that
it
is
constitutionally
impermissible
for
a
state
to
diminish
the
national
domain,
once...
and
this
is
what
the
special
master
really
found...
if
there
was
a
perfected
ancient
title,
that
was
then
state
seabed
but
it
was
also
a
part
of
the
national
domain,
and
i
do
not
think
that
any
state
legislature
under
our
constitutional
system
has
the
right
to
disclaim
territory
that
belongs
to
the
nation
as
a
whole,
as
well
as
to
it.
so,
for
those
three
reasons,
a,
it
wasn't
the
legislative
intent
to
abandon
anything;
b,
they
did
not
do
so
effectively,
look
at
the
charts
that
went
with
the
statute;
and
c,
i
don't
think
they
have
the
constitutional
power
to.
but
to
return
again,
your
honor,
to
the
first
part
of
your
question,
what
is
required
under
international
law?
in
the
first
place
it
would
have
been,
i
suggest
to
you,
an
international
problem
because
at
the
time
the
united
states
says
that
there
was
a
lapse,
that
is
in
the
last
century,
and
this
is
an
interesting
historical
point,
your
only
time
the
united
states
acquired
title
to
that
seabed,
the
first
time,
incidentally,
was
in
1949
during
the
truman
proclamation
which
extended
the
united
states'
assertion
of
imperium
and
dominion
from
the
three-mile
limit
out
to
the
edge
of
the
continental
shelf.
at
the
time
in
question,
in
the
late
1890's,
it
would
have
been...
the
option
was
clearly,
either
inland
waters
and
ergo,
state
seabed,
or,
not
belonging
to
the
united
states
at
all.
so,
this
blending,
as
it
were,
which
your
honor
has
referred
to
is
only
a
late
postwar
manifestation.
the
elements,
quickly
stated
in
bare
outline,
because
there
has
been
much
written
about
it
by
the
publicists,
in
international
law
to
have
abandonment
which
is
not
favored,
you
have
to
look
to
the
exact
circumstances.
first,
the
question
of
time.
as
long
as
there
is
not
an
adverse
claimant
and
the
united
states
has
not
proven...
has
not
even
suggested
that
since
colonial
times
any
other
foreign
nation
or
group
of
foreign
nations
has
ever
even
hinted
at
a
claim
to
nantucket
sound,
absent
an
adverse
claimant,
the
world
court,
the
international
court
of
justice
has
in
two
leading
cases
indicated
that
it
would
not
deem
significant
even
a
200-year
period
of
absolute
cessation
of
activity,
which
of
course
there
is
not
present
here.
there
were
always
exploitation
activities
and
assertions
of
dominion.
but
even
assuming
for
the
moment
for
the
sake
of
the
argument
that
from
colonial
times,
let's
say
from
the
time
of
the
revolution,
there
had
been
a
total
cessation
of
assertion
over
nantucket
sound,
the
world
court
in
the
two
cases
we
cited,
the
case
of
the
minkes
and
ekrahoes
islands
in
the
channel,
the
british
channel,
and
in
the
case,
the
so-called
eastern
greenland
case,
in
both
those
cases
a
time
period
of
over
200
years
was
deemed
as
not
significant
for
one
reason
only,
the
absence
of
an
adverse
claimant
which
is
also
absent
here.
secondly,
it
seems
well
settled
in
the
international
law,
according
to
the
pre-eminent
experts
whose
views
we
cite
in
our
brief,
that
you
have
to
consider
two
more
circumstances
if
abandonment
is
to
be
argued
about.
one
is
the
geographical
situation
on
the
ground.
it
seems
well
settled
that
if
the
so-called
abandoned
territory
is
in
direct
geographic
proximity,
if
it's
integrated
into
the
territory
or
very
much
adjacent
to
it,
of
the
so-called
abandoning
state,
that
counts
heavily
against
such
a
presumption.
and
most
important,
if
the
so-called
abandoning
nation
at
all
times
during
the
time
period
involved
retains
the
power
to
assert
its
control
and
jurisdiction
over
that
area,
if
it
wishes...
i'm
not
talking
about
actual
assertion
but
if
it
has
the
de
facto
power
to
reach
out,
as
it
were,
at
any
point
in
time
and
assert
its
jurisdiction
over
that
area,
then
it
seems
settled
in
international
law
that
you
can
have
no
presumption
of
abandonment
from
mere
inactivity.
you
must
then
find
an
actual
overt
express
act
of
renunciation
which,
i
submit
to
you,
is
not
present
in
this
case.
the
only
argument
the
united
states
has
is
that
late
19th
century
legislation
by
massachusetts,
and
i've
already
pointed
out
that
was
neither
the
legislative
intent
nor
did
the
legislature
even
presume
such
an
attempt
to
accomplish
the
purpose.
i
return
now
to
the
sole
question
which
remains
now,
i
submit,
before
the
court.
mr.
henry
herrmann
no,
your
honor,
i
haven't.
i'm
glad
you
reminded
me.
the
elements
of
ancient
title
really
are
in
direct...
somewhat
direct
contrast
to
historic
title,
so-called.
both
of
them,
and
this
terminology
gets
a
little
confusing
if
one
uses
it
quickly,
both
u.n.
study,
grounds
for
finding
historic
waters.
so,
the
antecedent
of
"historic
waters"
may
be
either
ancient
or
historic.
the
terminology
is
not
optimal
but
i
think
we
are
stuck
with
it.
now,
in
case
of
historic
title,
that
is
really,
as
the
master
explained
at
length,
a
matter
of
prescriptive
title.
you
attain
such
a
historic
title
prescriptively,
as
against
the
community
of
nations,
by
fulfilling
certain
prerequisites,
and
very
briefly
stated
they
are
as
expressed
again
in
the
u.s.
study,
the
juridical
regime.
they
are,
one,
you
have
to
have
a
claim
by
the
state,
by
the
sovereign.
secondly,
there
has
to
be
continuity
for
that
claim,
and
again
i
stress
that's
what
the
master
is
talking
about,
continuity
of
a
claim,
not
continuity
of
an
already
ripened
title.
and
third,
you
have
to
gauge
the
so-called
reaction
of
other
sovereign
states
and
some
scholars
say
you
have
to
have
an
actual
lack
of
protest,
you
have
to
have
acquiescence.
others
say
the
mere
absence
of
protest
is
enough.
those
are
the
elements
of
historic
title.
ancient
title
is
quite
different.
ancient
title
is
not
attained
by
prescription.
it
is
really
a
perfected
original
title.
it
must
under
prevailing
law,
and
this
seems
clear,
be
acquired
prior
to
the
regime
of
freedom
of
the
seas,
because
since
freedom
of
the
seas
became
an
accepted
doctrine
in
international
law,
certainly
no
earlier
than
the
18th
century
and
some
experts
say
as
late
as
the
early
19th
century,
prior
to...
since
freedom
of
the
seas
became
a
doctrine
of
international
law
you
cannot
acquire
ancient
title
to
seabed
non-prescriptively
because
you
would
have
to
be
acquiring
it
against
the
interest
of
the
community
of
nations,
against
the
res
communas
which
is
the
open
seabeds,
the
open
ocean
seabed.
however,
prior
to
the
coming
into
force
of
the
freedom
of
the
seas
doctrine,
which
i
think
we
have
demonstrated
is
the
case
here
and
which
the
master
found
in
our
favor,
prior
to
that
doctrine
coming
to
force
you
could
acquire...
and
this
is
why
it's
important
not
to
get
overly
involved
in
the
term
18th
century.
in
ancient
title
you
acquire
an
original
title,
not
by
prescription
but
by
fulfilling
certain
acts
which
were
required
under
then
prevailing
international
domestic
law.
those
acts
were
discovery
of
new
territory,
of
res
nullius,
of
terra
nova,
discovery
followed
by
effective
occupation
to
fortify
the
title.
the
master
his
quite
explicitly
found
in
our
favor
on
both
those
issues.
that,
justice
stevens
and
justice
o'connor,
if
as
we
see
the
elements,
the
central
elements
of
distinction
between
these
two
types
of
title,
both
of
which
can
individually
without
the
other
being
present
lead
to
a
finding
of
historic
waters
which
would
vest
inland
status
in
a
particular
body
of
water.
mr.
henry
herrmann
under
prevailing
international
law,
and
by
that
i
wish
to
point
out
to
the
court,
we
do
have
a
problem
of
so-called
intertemporal
law
in
this
international
law
related
case.
intertemporal
law,
and
that's
a
well
settled
doctrine
by
now,
means
you
must
apply
of
necessity
the
international
law
rules
prevailing
at
the
point
in
time
when
you're
looking
at
the
evidence.
you
do
not
apply
modern
international
law
retroactively.
if
you
are
looking
at
a
claim
of
acquired
ancient
title,
say
in
the
17th
century,
you
must
look
to
it
under
standards
then
prevailing.
under
standards
then
prevailing,
your
honor,
occupation
could
have
been
satisfied
for
a
marine
area
of
this
sort
by
effective
settlement
of
the
surrounding
land
masses,
that's
point
one.
that
certainly
occurred
here.
indeed,
we
have
evidence
on
the
record
that
the
british
explorer
gosenoll
sailed
into
the
sound
and
immediately
erected
a
fort
at
the
entrance
to
vineyard
sound.
the
second
element,
and
it's
a
very
important
one,
is
exclusive
and
extensive
exploitation
of
the
resources
of
such
a
body
of
water.
the
master,
of
course,
based
on
voluminous
evidence
by
massachusetts,
made
findings
that
there
was...
and
i
think
these
were
almost
his
express
words...
he
said
that
there
had
been
such
extensive
and
exclusive
exploitation
of
the
resources
of
nantucket
sound
by
the
british
settlers
to
be
equal
to
a
formal
assertion
of
jurisdiction
over
those
waters.
that
was
his
finding.
that
would
be
the
second
element.
i
would
point
out
further,
justice
stevens,
that
if
there
is
one
thing
settled
in
international
law
and
the
government
has
conceded
this
in
its
brief,
one
undisputed
way
of
gaining
ancient
title
for
seabed
is
through
sedentary
fisheries.
there
are
several
well-known
examples.
one
was
cited
by
the
government,
the
so-called
caylon
pearl
fisheries.
there
are
also
the
fisheries
in
the
arabian
gulf,
the
pearl
fisheries
off
sicily.
there
is
the
famous
case
of
the
tunisian
sponge
fisheries.
this
is
one
thing
that's
beyond
question
by
now,
that
you
can
obtain
ancient
title
by
that
means
and
certainly
if
the
master
found
anything
at
all,
he
found
that
the
exploitation
over
the
sedentary
fisheries
in
the
sound
were
continuous,
that
they
were
exclusive,
and
that
they
were
vital,
just
like
in
the
norwegian
fisheries
case
which
was
cited,
that
they
were
a
vital
element
for
the
survival
of
that
continuous
community
as
our
expert
witness
called
it,
a
marine
resource
region.
and,
that
is
how
one
could,
and
indeed
in
this
case
did
acquire
ancient
title
by
occupation
over
seabed
area.
finally,
i
would
add
that
what
you
also
have
to
look
to
is
the
domestic
law
at
that
time.
we
have
pointed
out,
and
we
return
now
to
the
evidentiary
issue.
the
master
said
quite
correctly,
we
could
not
have
claimed
any
area
as
ancient
title
unless
it
conformed
to
the
then
prevailing
domestic
british
law
which
delineated
between
inland
waters
and
open
sea
based
upon
the
fauces
terra
doctrine,
which
meant,
can
you
see
from
headland
to
headland
across
the
entrance
to
any
body
of
water.
if
you
could,
the
water
therein
was
inland.
if
you
couldn't,
it
was
open
sea.
mr.
henry
herrmann
it
is
under
these
circumstances,
your
honor,
as
the
master,
i
think,
correctly
found.
if
we
are
claiming
ancient
title
in
a
given
century
and
we
claim
it
originated
in
colonial
times,
then
you
must
of
course
look,
as
i
said,
to
international
law
and
the
domestic
law
at
that
time
and
see
what
would
the
then
prevailing
sovereign
without
dispute
have
looked
to,
to
international
law
and
his
own
domestic
law,
whether
he
can
claim
the
waters
or
not.
the
prevailing
law
of
england
at
that
time
was
that
you
could
only
claim
it
as
inland
waters
if
the
eyesight
test
prevailed.
of
course
in
a
later
case
you
could
theoretically,
although
we're
not
claiming
that
here
now,
to
answer
your
question,
you
could
claim
historic
title
after
freedom
of
the
seas
came
into
force,
and
say,
we
base
it
on
the
same
theory,
it
is
encloseable,
but
we
are
not
doing
that
here.
that
would
be
a
claim
of
historic
title
ripening
after
the
freedom
of
the
seas
came
into
force.
we
did
claim
that
before
the
special
master.
we
are
no
longer
pressing
that
particular
claim
at
this
point
in
time.
we
would
turn,
in
connection
therewith,
to
the
crucial
remaining
issue
before
this
court,
what
is
the
proper
standard
of
evidence.
the
master
was
satisfied
that
massachusetts
to
his
satisfaction
had
shown
all
the
elements
of
ancient
title.
the
only
reason
he
could
not
recommend
a
decree
in
our
favor
was
that
at
one
point
only
he
felt
himself
constrained
by
what
he
thought
the
implications
of
prior
decisions
of
this
court
were
as
to,
quote,
"clear
beyond
doubt
evidence".
we
said
that
he
felt,
if
it
was
a
case
of
first
impression,
he
felt
that
was
not
an
appropriate
standard
for
proceedings
of
this
sort.
here
you
have
the
situation,
your
honors,
where
an
experienced
federal
trial
judge
found
after
a
lengthy
trial
that
he
was
satisfied
that
in
colonial
times
you
could
indeed
see
across
the
eastern
entrance
of
nantucket
sound,
which
is
all
the
case
boils
down
to.
he
felt
that
by
what
he
considered
the
implications
of
two
prior
cases,
the
second
california
case
and
the
second
louisiana
case,
he
felt
that
he
could
not
on
that
ground,
because
that
one
element
was
not,
quote,
"totally
clear
beyond
doubt",
although
he
was
satisfied,
he
could
not
recommend
a
finding
in
our
favor.
the
united
states
has
tried
to
divert
a
discussion
of
that,
what
we
think
is
the
only
remaining
issue,
by
getting
into
this
lapse
question.
well,
the
master
never
found
lapse
as
to
any
perfected
ancient
title,
nor...
it's
not
easy
to
see
why
he
should
have
because
the
matter
wasn't
raised
before
him
nor
was
it
briefed
to
him.
all
that
was
discussed
by
the
master
was
whether
an
historic
title
had
ripened,
whether
acquisition
of
an
historic
title
had
later
ripened.
nobody
argued
or
briefed
to
the
master
the
question,
did
an
already
perfected
colonial,
ancient
title
once
acquired,
lapse.
in
other
words,
the
issue
is
retention
vis-a-vis
acquisition
and
the
united
states,
it
seems
to
me,
commingles
this.
they
say
you
don't
have
to
reach
the
evidentiary
issue,
and
i
submit
that
that
is
what
should
be
reached
because
that's
the
only
remaining
element
in
the
case.
the
united
states...
let
me
just
finish
up
on
the
evidentiary
issue
by
saying
that
we've
come
a
long
way
since
the
briefing
began.
if
the
court
will
look
at
page
25
of
the
government's
reply
brief,
there
they
have
expressly
conceded
that
such
a
high...
so-called
higher
standard
of
evidence
need
only
be
imposed
where
the
government
has
disclaimed.
they
have
now
given
up
their
previous
argument
that
it
is
of
necessity
because
of
the
requirements
of
international
law
and
domestic
law.
so,
what
the
government
is
really
saying,
and
i
ask
the
court
to
ponder
the
implications,
they
can
come
into
a
case
even
with
a
disclaimer
which
the
court
would
otherwise
hold
to
be
non-dispositive
because
it
is
filed
on
the
eve
of
or
during
litigation,
and
they're
really
saying
in
effect,
they
can
come
into
court,
push
a
button,
and
by
pushing
a
button
impose
a
higher
standard
of
proof
on
the
claiming
state,
even
though
it
is
a
disclaimer
made
during
litigation.
i
cannot...
i
do
not
think
that
can
be
reconciled
with
the
previous
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
henry
herrmann
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
henry
herrmann
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
say
about
the
question
of
a
so-called
dispositive
united
states
disclaimer,
does
it
really
matter
if
one
terms
a
litigative
disclaimer,
as
i
call
it,
a
disclaimer
made
either
on
the
eve
or
during
litigation
to
be
dispositive,
or
whether
the
united
states
can
merely
thereby,
like
dialing
an
air
conditioning,
ratchet
up
the
level
of
proof
needed
and
thereby
dispose
of
a
claim
which,
as
in
this
particular
instance,
the
finder
of
fact
felt
had
been
satisfactorily
proven.
it
seems
to
me
as
a
functional
equivalent--
mr.
henry
herrmann
--no,
justice
white.
i
don't
think--
mr.
henry
herrmann
--it
has
the
power
to
disclaim,
but
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
that
the
issue
is
what
effects
this
court
will
give
to
an
exercise
of
such
power,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
and
particularly
in
the
second
louisiana
case,
page
<seventy-seven>
[=
77],
this
court
has
made
it
clear
that
it
and
only
it
will
decide
in
the
individual
instance
what
effect
to
give
to
this
claim.
mr.
henry
herrmann
if
the
disclaimer
had
been
unequivocal,
clearly
communicated
to
foreign
nations,
and
had
preceded
the
outset
of
the
litigation
by
a
full
decade,
i
would
say
we
would
have
a
serious
problem,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
herrmann
by
that
i
mean--
mr.
henry
herrmann
--no,
because
i
don't
think
the
court
meant,
if
you
look
at
the
louisiana
decision,
i
don't
think
the
court
meant
to
use
the
beyond
doubt
standard
in
such
a
fashion.
i
think
as
i
respectfully
read
the
court's
decision,
it
meant
that
it
would
use
the
"clear
beyond
doubt"
standard
to
determine...
it
was
really
analogous
to
a
summary
judgment
situation.
i
think
the
operative
discussion
is,
what
dispositive
effect,
if
any,
do
you
give
to
the
disclaimer
as
a
matter
of
substantive
law.
if
the
disclaimer
had
been
in
the
bona
fide
exercise
of
the
foreign
affairs
powers
of
the
united
states,
well
predating
the
reservation
of
jurisdiction
by
this
court,
then
it
might
perhaps
be
fairly
argued
by
the
united
states
that
it
has
now--
mr.
henry
herrmann
--i
think,
justice--
mr.
henry
herrmann
--well,
he
said...
i
must
submit
that
he
was
quite
cautious
in
what
he
said.
he
said
that
if
it
were
a
case
of
first
impression,
he
would
agree
with
us.
secondly,
he
said,
impliedly
he
felt
constrained,
but
he
certainly
came
as
close
as
one
can
get
to
a...
and
saying,
take
this
to
the
full
court,
this
seems
to
me
a
judgment
call.
i
think
the
master
was
really
as
cautious
as
a
special
master
can
be,
not
foreclosing
that
issue,
and
i
think
that
to
give...
again,
and
i
must
again
point
to
the
distinction
between
acquiring
historic
title
and
whether
an
ancient
title
prevails.
as
to
acquiring
historic
title,
if
the
title
had
not
ripened
yet
at
the
time
the
united
states
disclaims
outside
litigation,
prior
to
litigation,
then
that
might
as
an
evidentiary
matter
fairly
be
said
to
prevent
the
ripening
of
a
claim
as
an
evidentiary
matter
under
public
international
law,
if
the
sovereign
disclaims.
but
as
to
ancient
title,
i
think
this
court
has
several
times
indicated
it
would
look
with
considerable
caution,
considerable
suspicion,
at
an
attempt
to
retrench
the
territory
of
states
already
vested.
so,
if
the
ancient
title
as
the
master
found
was
already
perfected,
the
question
still
remains,
even
if
there
had
been
according
to
your
hypothetical,
justice
white,
a
bona
fide
non-litigation
related,
non-litigation
contemporaneous
disclaimer
by
the
united
states,
it
would
nevertheless
not
operate
against
an
ancient
title.
my
time
is
up.
