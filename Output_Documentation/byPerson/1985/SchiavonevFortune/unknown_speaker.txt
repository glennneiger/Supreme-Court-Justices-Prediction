unknown
speaker
mr.
schnitzer.
unknown
speaker
was
your
complaint
filed
in
the
district
court
within
the
statute
of
limitations
period?
unknown
speaker
when
the
notice
was
first
served--
unknown
speaker
--the
first
notice
was
not
served,
was
it
refused?
unknown
speaker
wasn't
it
refused,
r-e-f-u-s-e-d?
unknown
speaker
it
was
refused?
unknown
speaker
is
that
noticed?
unknown
speaker
but
you
knew
it
had
been
refused,
didn't
you?
unknown
speaker
you
knew
it
had
been
refused?
unknown
speaker
what
did
you
then
do,
and
when?
unknown
speaker
how
was
it
aware
of
it?
unknown
speaker
they
didn't
read
it.
they
refused
it.
unknown
speaker
no,
i'm
only
saying
they
refused
it.
unknown
speaker
how
can
you
say
they
read
it
if
they
say
the
record
was
that
they
refused
it?
the
whole
purpose
of
accepting
it
is
to
show
that
you
read
it.
if
you
refuse
it,
you
say
you
refuse
to
read
it.
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
unknown
speaker
and
you
admit
you
were
wrong?
unknown
speaker
so,
what
do
you
put
the
weight
on
them
for?
i
think
the
weight's
on
you.
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting,
mr.
schnitzer,
that
they
had
to
read
it
before
they
knew
whether
they
would
refuse
it
or
accept
it?
unknown
speaker
if
they
didn't
read
it
they
might
find
themselves
having
default
judgments
entered
against
them
in
appropriate
cases,
is
that
not
so?
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
schnitzer,
by
the
time
that
time
inc.
received
notice
under
your
theory,
that
was
after
the
statute
of
limitations?
unknown
speaker
what
excuse
do
you
have
for
not
naming
the
proper
party?
what
possible
excuse
do
you
offer
for
not
naming
the
original
party?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
the
reason
you
have
rules--
unknown
speaker
--you
have
rules
so
that
people
do
not
make
mistakes.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
don't
want
the
rule,
do
you?
you
could
come
in
and
say,
any
rule
of
this
court
or
any
other
court,
i
made
a
mistake
so
i'm
excused.
that's
what
you
want
the
rule
to
be?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question.
do
you
agree...
i
notice
your
amendment
says,
"fortune
also
known
as
time
incorporated."
do
you
say
they
are
different
parties
or
the
same
party?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
there
is
only
one,
is
your
amendment
an
amendment
changing
the
party
against
whom
the
claim
is
asserted
within
the
meaning
of
the
rule?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
don't
t
think
the
rule
applies
at
all?
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
that
the
same
rule
applies
to
a
case
in
which
you
served
time
inc.
when
you
mean
to
serve
time
incorporated,
as
if
you
had
served
time
when
you
meant
to
serve
newsweek,
say?
is
it
the
same
rule,
and
then
you
would
later
change
it
to
correct
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
schnitzer,
it
would
help
if
you
would
help
if
you
would
stay
in
front
of
the
microphone.
it's
a
little
hard
for
us
to
hear
on
this
side.
unknown
speaker
were
all
of
those
cases
you
mentioned
explainable
mistakes?
for
example,
you
named
the
wrong
officer...
i
still
am
unable
to
understand
that
you'd
have
an
explainable
defense.
you
just
made
a
mistake.
you
could
have
called
up
the
new
york
times
information
service
and--
unknown
speaker
--and
we
wouldn't
have
to
worry
with
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
schnitzer,
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
rules
is
to
require
thing
to
be
done
in
a
particular
period
of
time.
you
have
to
have
some
time
limits.
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course
the
reason
the
third
circuit
said
the
double
standard
was
because
your
case
is
different
than
that
of
the
kind
you
say
it
should
be
analogized
to.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
higher
purpose
is
to
let
in
people
who
make
mistakes?
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
that
any
judges
or
any
courts
who
disagree
with
your
view
are
radicals?
unknown
speaker
as
often
happens
in
criminal
cases,
if
the
complaint
here
had
described
fortune
a.
k.
a.
,
also
known
as
time
incorporated,
would
that
have
satisfied
the
rule?
unknown
speaker
does
this
record
show
whether
the
person
to
whom
the
complaint
was
presented
made
a
xerox
or
other
copy
of
it
before
they
refused
the
service?
unknown
speaker
your
position
is,
i
take
it,
or
time's
position
was
that
there
wasn't
any
party
at
all
named
in
the
complaint?
unknown
speaker
and
hence
the
amendment
for
the
first
time
named
a
party?
unknown
speaker
but
had
time
been
named
as
a
party
the
service
would
have
been
good
and
the
statute
of
limitations
would
not
have
barred
the
suit?
unknown
speaker
would
you
agree,
mr.
banta,
that
the
service
would
have
been
proper
if
the
complaint
had
said...
had
not
mentioned
time
at
all
but
just
said
"publisher
of
fortune"
instead
of
"fortune"?
unknown
speaker
so,
that
would
not
be
a
valid
service.
supposing
they
said
inc.>
["]
instead
of
"time
incorporated"?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
differentiate
between
those
that
are
so
close
and...
is
it
a
question
of
whether
you
understand
who
is
being
sued?
unknown
speaker
what
if
it
said,
the
corporation
who
publishes
the
magazine
"fortune",
whose
name
i
don't
at
the
moment
know?
unknown
speaker
how
did
the
person
to
whom
the
complaint
was
first
mailed
know
enough
to
give
it
to
time?
unknown
speaker
that
letter
was,
i
suppose,
transmitted
to
time
also
with
the
complaint?
unknown
speaker
so,
time
at
that
point
knew
that
the
intention
was
to
sue
time
incorporated?
unknown
speaker
so,
no
one
was
misled?
unknown
speaker
but
they
did
not
know
it
within
the
period
of
the
statute
of
limitations?
unknown
speaker
would
it
be
irrational
in
your
view
as
distinguished
from
the
mistake,
or
a
correct
application
of
the
rule,
would
it
be
irrational
for
a
court
to
conclude
that
the
cover
letter
was
part
of
the
pleadings?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
in
the
record?
is
the
letter
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
that's
all
right.
unknown
speaker
let
me
just
be
sure
that
i
have
one
thing
understood.
unknown
speaker
you
do
agree,
though,
this
rule
applies
to
misnomers
as
well
as
to
true
changes
of
parties?
unknown
speaker
but
is
it
not
true
that
under
the
prior
law
of
misnomer,
there
were
lots
of
cases
with
very,
very
trivial
such
as
the
difference
between
time
incorparated
and
time
inc.,
which
were
treated
as
misnomers
and
the
misnomer
rule
applied
to
those
cases?
unknown
speaker
it
would
seem
to
me,
and
i
don't
really
understand
what
you
answer
to
this
is,
if
they
had
sued
time
inc.
instead
of
time
incorporated,
i
don't
know
why
you
couldn't
make
precisely
the
same
argument
and
you
should
prevail,
it
seems
to
me,
if
you're
right
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
a
misnomer,
they
got
the
wrong
name.
unknown
speaker
no,
the
reason
it
comes
to
mind
is
because
mr.
schnitzer,
i'm
sure
in
good
faith,
kept
referring
to
you
as
time
inc.
in
his
argument
and
you
are
not
time
inc.
he
is
talking
about
somebody
that's
not
even
here.
unknown
speaker
but
surely
the
question
of
service
can't
depend
on
whether
the
corporation
has
made
that
mistake
itself.
unknown
speaker
well,
putting
misleading
conduct
to
one
side,
entirely
one
side,
and
assume
you
have
been
very
regular
in
the
use
of
the
name
and
always
used
inc.>
["]--
unknown
speaker
--but
logically,
if
we
can't
look
at
equities
or
anything,
if
we
just
follow
the
plain
language,
it
covers
that
case.
unknown
speaker
mr.
banta,
it
is
still
true,
is
it
not,
that
apart
from
the
service
problem
if
you
had
the
same
kind
of
fact
scenario
that
you
have
here,
you
named
the
united
states
when
you
should
have
named
the
united
states
postal
service,
didn't
correct
it
until
after
the
statute
ran,
you'd
be
out
of
luck?
unknown
speaker
so
that,
the
same
rule
applies
to
the
government
as
to
private
parties?
