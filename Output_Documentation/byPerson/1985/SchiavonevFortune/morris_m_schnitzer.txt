mr.
morris
m.
schnitzer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
it
please
the
court:
my
clients,
the
plaintiffs
and
the
petitioners
in
this
court,
sued
over
a
libel
against
them
which
was
published
in
fortune
magazine.
the
complaint
was
filed
only
days
before
the
one-year
defamation
limitation
statute
in
new
jersey
which
dates
from
publication.
the
defendant
was
described
meticulously
in
the
complaint.
it
was
a
foreign
corporation
and
the
publisher
of
fortune
magazine.
in
all
the
world
only
one
suable
entity
fitted
that
description
and
that
happened
to
be,
turned
out
to
be,
time
inc.--
the
difficulty
was
that
the
plaintiff
used
fortune
as
the
name
applied
to
and
appropriately
described
defendant.
the
summons
and
complaint
went
out
unerringly,
arriving
at
the
registered
agent
in
new
jersey
for
time
inc.
and
the
registered
agent
fulfilled
its
duty
appropriately
and
delivered
the
summons
and
complaint
to
the
executive
suite
at
time
inc.,
and
there
in
fairly...
i
would
think
instantaneously
self-recognition
took
over
and
it
was
understood
at
once
that
the
plaintiff
had
made
some
kind
of
an
error.
at
that
point,
with
hindsight,
i
think
it
also
clear
that
the
decision
warned
in
the
executive
suite,
and
that
is
not
to
get
entangled
with
the
merits,
and
instead
to
prevail
on
the
law,
that
is,
the
law
of
procedure.
what
happened
was
that
as
the
plaintiff
understood
the
error
and
learned
and
confirmed,
i
might
add,
that
the
papers
arrived
at
time
headquarters
about
four
days,
certainly
no
longer,
after
the
last
hour
of
the
statute
of
limitations
period.
the
plaintiff
undertook
to
amend,
to
install
time
inc.
as
the
defendant
in
the
action,
and
at
that
stage
the
defendant
implemented
its
resolve
to
concentrate
on
the
procedure
and
moved
for
a
summary
judgment.
the
defendant
prevailed
twice,
once
in
the
district
court
and
again
in
the
court
of
appeals.
at
issue
is
rule
15-c,
the
second
summons.
i
mention
the
second
summons
because
it
focuses
so
squarely
on
party
amendments,
of
pleadings
that
must
be
taken
to
be
the
rule
that
governs,
and
it
was
certainly
the
one
on
which
the
courts
below
concentrated.
that
rule,
adopted
in
1966,
has
these
characteristics.
it
begins
by
saying
that
it
governs
an
amendment
changing
the
party,
and
i
underscore
both
"changing"
and
"the".
it
then
goes
on
to
lay
down
the
requirements
first,
that
the
person
to
be
brought
in,
the
defendant
to
be
brought
in,
must
have
had
notice
of
the
pending
action,
secondly
that
the
overall
circumstances
are
such
that
no
prejudice
would
be
entailed
by
allowing
the
amendment,
and
thirdly,
that
it
must
be
clear
to
the
person
eventually
brought
in
that
but
for
some
adversary,
he
would
have
been
the
one
originally
named.
now,
unquestionably
time
inc.
fitted
these
requirements
pretty
much
as
a
hand
might
fit
a
glove.
the
overriding
requirement
also
in
the
rule
is
the
following,
that
this
awareness
must
come
home
to
the
party
to
be
brought
in,
quote,
"within
the
period
provided
by
law
for
commencing
the
action
against
him."
now,
almost
from
the
inscription,
this
provision
in
the
federal
civil
rules,
two
schools
emerged.
one,
and
i
think
it
historically
to
be
the
first
in
the
fifth
circuit,
was
to
say
that
this
ought
to
be
given
a
reading
infused
with
its
purpose,
i.e.
with
its
history
and
if
so,
what
would
happen
is
that
the
period
for
awareness
or
notice
to
the
pretty
to
be
brought
in
would
be
no
shorter
than
that
which
would
normally
come
to
that
very
same
party
if
originally
and
correctly
identified.
now,
in
the
latter
case,
a
complaint
can
be
filed
the
last
hour
of
a
limitations
period
and
then
promptly
and
within
a
reasonably
short
time,
not
instantaneously,
the
summons
and
complaint
go
out
and
can
be
served.
mr.
morris
m.
schnitzer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
morris
m.
schnitzer
yes,
your
honor.
there's
absolutely
no
dispute
about
that.
that
was
one
rule,
a
single
standard
of
notice
serves
the
purpose
of
the
15-c.
mr.
morris
m.
schnitzer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
morris
m.
schnitzer
the
first
notice
came
with
the
summons
and
complaint,
your
honor.
mr.
morris
m.
schnitzer
yes,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
morris
m.
schnitzer
--yes,
but
your
honor--
mr.
morris
m.
schnitzer
--in
other
words,
somebody
read
this
and
then
as
we
said
about
the
englishman
who
received
a
tax
form
from
inland
revenue,
declined
to
subscribe.
mr.
morris
m.
schnitzer
pardon?
mr.
morris
m.
schnitzer
certainly.
mr.
morris
m.
schnitzer
i'm
not
sure
i
have
the
exact
date,
but
my
recollection
is
that
it
was
refused
in...
on
may
23,
your
honor,
and
i
think
the
motion
to
amend
came
in
june,
but
by
that
time
not
only
was
time
aware
of
the
action--
mr.
morris
m.
schnitzer
--your
honor,
by
reading
the
summons
and
complaint.
mr.
morris
m.
schnitzer
are
you
saying
that
the
record--
mr.
morris
m.
schnitzer
--they
did,
your
honor,
but
my
understanding
is--
mr.
morris
m.
schnitzer
--i
have
a
different
impression.
i
have
the
impression
that
they
read
it
and
said,
this
is
a
vaccination
that
doesn't
take
with
us.
mr.
morris
m.
schnitzer
you
are
certainly
right,
your
honor,
in
saying
that
they
wouldn't
accept
it.
mr.
morris
m.
schnitzer
oh,
i'd
gladly
do
that.
mr.
morris
m.
schnitzer
weight?
we
have
a
rule
applying
to
whole,
and
the
question
is
how
should
it
be
read,
and
if
read
as
three
circuits
have
read
it,
time
can
refuse
or
accept
summonses
and
complaints
just
as
they
choose,
but
it
will
be
a...
i
say
a
vaccination
that
takes.
it
will
be
a
summons
and
complaint
which
is
neglected
at
the
peril
of
the
party
who's
doing
that,
and
for
that
default
procedures--
mr.
morris
m.
schnitzer
--i
am...
how
shall
i
say,
morally
certain
that
it
was
read,
that
a
studied
decision
was
made
after
conferences
with
counsel
who
decided
that
a
mistake
about
the
name
was
something
that
could
be
capitalized
on.
mr.
morris
m.
schnitzer
not
only
would
that
happen,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
anybody
who
is
accosted
by
a
sheriff
who
says,
i
have
a
summons
and
complaint
for
him,
says
goodbye,
i
have
another
appointment,
takes
the
consequences
that
is,
he's
chargeable
with
notice
of
what
he
could
have
read.
i
think
that,
in
procedure,
is
fairly
basic.
mr.
morris
m.
schnitzer
the
whole
crux
of
the
case
is
exactly
that.
for
the
two
lower
courts
it
was
as
follows,
that
there
is
a
double
standard,
i.e.
one
for
a
party
to
be
brought
in
who
must
learn
before
the
statute
of
limitations
expires
cinderella-fashion,
midnight
of
the
last
evening,
of
the
period,
and
if
he
doesn't
he
can
spend
the
rest
of
his
life
free
from
the
entanglement
of
the
case,
whereas
had
this
very
defendant
been
correctly
named
and
received
notice
at
the
instant
in
time
when
it
got
it
through
the
summons
and
complaint,
there
couldn't
have
been
the
slightest
doubt
that
they
would
have
heaved
a
sigh
and
proceeded
to
address
the
merits
which
we--
mr.
morris
m.
schnitzer
--an
error,
your
honor.
i
repeat,
the
admission
of
error.
it
was
simply
an
error
and
it
was
an
avoidable
error.
it
that
matters,
that
too
is
in
the
record.
mr.
morris
m.
schnitzer
pardon?
mr.
morris
m.
schnitzer
your
honor,
let
me
say
it's
just
the
reverse,
and
i'll
tell
you
why.
this--
mr.
morris
m.
schnitzer
--that
has
not
been
my
experience
because
i've
made
my
quota
of
mistakes
and
what
i've
found
is
that
this
magnificent
body
of
sparsely,
sparely
worded
rules
has
within
it
the
capability
to
fulfill
what
i
regard
as
the
first
commandment
of
all
procedure
described
in
rule
1,
and
that
is
to
use
the
litigation
period
as
an
interval
of
gestation
for
the
safe
delivery
of
the
merits
into
a
final
judgment
at
the
other
end
of
the
process,
unmarred
and
unblemished
by
procedures
so
that
mistakes
are
made
and
this
rule
was
written
to
correct
mistakes.
if
mistakes
are
made
by
a
wise
discipline,
the
system
absorbs
it
because
it's
in
the
nature
of
the
human
condition
to
be
frail
and
occasionally
lapsing
into
mistakes.
so,
the
whole
system
of
procedure,
i
think
has
a,
in
my
mind,
a
beautiful
balancing
tension
between
regularity
and
system
without
which
the
process
might
be
most
seriously
marred,
and
denying
correction
within
limits.
now,
as
i
say...
oh,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
morris
m.
schnitzer
your
honor,
there
is
only
one.
mr.
morris
m.
schnitzer
of
course,
your
honor.
mr.
morris
m.
schnitzer
your
honor,
in
words,
it
does
not.
there
are
three
kinds
of
party
changes:
misnomer,
the
wrong
name
for
the
right
party;
switching
b
for
a
and
b
and
a
are
two
different,
distinct
parties;
c,
additions,
a
brand-new
party
so
that
the
number
enlarges.
this
rule
for
only
class
b,
switching,
changing
the
party,
adding
the
party
and
correcting
the
name
of
a
party.
but
in
the
process
of
composing
it
the
commission...
this
court's
rules
commission
in
proceeding
to
write
the
rule
narrowly,
proceeded
to
comment
on
it
broadly
so
by
an
overreach
of
comment
they
said,
we
are
gathering
a
misnomer...
why
they
didn't
say
so
is
a
problem,
and
we
are
also
gathering
in
party
additions,
and
once
again
why
they
didn't
say
so
is
a
comment.
but
the
courts
have
generally
taken
this
attitude:
we
will
work
within
the
over-broad
comment
about
a
more
narrowly
worded
rule
but
also,
in
my
view
the
commission
was
quite
unmistakeable
in
its...
how
shall
i
put
it,
in
its
expressed
intention
to
make
sure
that
this
very
scenario,
this
very
scenario,
would
never
happen
again.
mr.
morris
m.
schnitzer
yes,
if
you
will
be
consistent
and
say
that
if
the
rule
is
given
an
over-broad
interpretation,
let
it
also
be
infused
with
the
commission's
purpose
which
by
definition
reads
the
magic
words,
"within
the
period
provided
by
law
for
commencing
the
action
against."
to
include
a
period
for
timely
service
after
the
expiration
of
the
period.
what
is
timely
service?
the
period
that
it
would
have
been
timely
for
summons
and
complaint
to
reach
a
correctly
named
party
in
the
first
instance.
now,
my
answer
to
you,
justice
stevens,
then
is
sure,
it
applies
to
all
three
categories
despite
the
fact
that
it
doesn't
say
so,
if
you
will
also
take
the
same
source,
information
source,
for
the
intended
interpretation
of
this
limiting
summons
fro
two
reasons,
one,
four
cases
have
been
decided
within
a
very
short
period
of
time
in
which--
mr.
morris
m.
schnitzer
--within
the
period
of
a
year
for
cases
have
been
decided
in
district
courts
dismissing
appeals
from
social
security
decisions,
and
in
one
of
them
we
do
have
the
scenario
in
detail.
the
others
probably
fit
the
same
thing,
filed
within
60
days,
named
a
government
officer
but
not
the
right
one,
all
dismissed
when
amendments
were
sought
and
failed.
in
one
of
them,
the
sandwich
case,
the
scenario
is
exactly
this
case,
a
last-hour
filing
of
the
complaint.
a
summons
and
complaint
went
out
to
a
government
officer,
not
the
right
one,
of
course,
and
then
a
motion
to
amend.
the
court
dismissed
in
all
four.
professor
bise
wrote
an
article
in
which
he
barely
suppressed
the
acerbity
of
his
criticism
as
professors
sometimes
do
with
court
decisions,
and
insisted
on
a
rule
change,
giving
up
on
the
hope
that
the
courts
would
arrive
at
that
result
by
rule
interpretations.
this
rule
emerged
with
the
express
object
of
overcoming
sandwich,
the
facts
of
this
very
case.
so,
i'm
on
pretty
good
ground,
i
think,
when
i
say
that
if
the
rule
should
be
fulfilled
in
its
outreach,
i.e.,
it's
applied
to
a
misnomer,
then
let
it
be
fulfilled
in
every
nook
and
cranny
of
the
comment,
and
that
would
be--
mr.
morris
m.
schnitzer
--i
accept
everything
your
honor
says
because
it's
very
definitely
true.
the
mistake
could
have
been
prevented,
and
of
course
should
have
been
presented.
but
the
question
is,
given
the
mistake,
how
is
the
system
guilty?
mr.
morris
m.
schnitzer
that's
so,
your
honor.
now,
as
i
said
there
are
two
rules...
two
sets
of
approaches.
one,
the
second
circuit,
it
came
early
but
it
climaxed
in
an
opinion
by
then
chief
judge
kleinberg
in
ingram
v.
kumar,
and
no
exposition
on
my
part
will
improve
on
what
i
regard
as
the
pinnacle
of
insight
about
the
correct
application
of
the...
the
second
circuit
simply
held
that
a
double
standard
notice
designed
to
contain
prejudice
and
become
a
rule
of
thumb
for
assessing
prejudice,
that
a
double
standard
of
notice
not
only
is
anomalous
but
inherently
incompatible
with
the
fair
administration
of
a
rule
of
this
court
for
which
the
intention
need
not
be
sought
in
other
publications
but
for
which
the
court
has
only
to
look
into
it,
as
this
court
carries
the
responsibility
for
the
consequences
of
how
its
rules
work
in
practice,
i.e.
by
the
standard
of
whether
the
merits
can
be
addressed
and
fulfilled
or
whether
they're
blocked
out
by
some
error
which
the
court
has
the
means
to
correct.
in
my
view
there
are
five
strong
reasons
why
the
court
below
should
be
reversed.
first,
that
as
applied
in
the
third
circuit
as
compared
with
the
second,
it
achieves
a
double
standard
of
notice
for
which
there
is
no
laches,
no
reason
of
police.
as
a
matter
of
fact
judge
sykes
in
this
very
case
said,
in
point
of
policy
our
view,
the
view
for
which
i
contend
this
morning,
is,
quote,
15-c.
now,
it
is
some
commentary
on
a
rule
of
law
that
a
judge
squirms
visibly
in
the
process
of
applying
it
and
that's
quite
true
about
every
application
of
the
point
of
view
which
the
third
circuit
adopted
in
this
case
because
asked
for
its
comment
on
it,
the
most
that
they
could
say
is
the
rule
is
too
plain
not
to
read
literally,
but
no
policy,
no
other
reason
or
justification
for
that
result
whereas
those
who
favor
the
point
of
view
for
which
i
argue,
among
courts,
have
this
to
say,
that
they
find
it
appealing,
a
member
of
this
court
said
that,
that
as
a
policy
matter
it's
quite
persuasive,
that
was
judge
sykes,
that
the
other
point
of
view
is
anomalous,
judge
feinberg,
that
the
construction
for
which
i
contend
is
permissible
and
desirable,
again
judge
feinburg.
the
sixth
circuit,
they
were
stronger.
they
said
about
the
other
rule
that
it
was
narrow,
formalistic,
and
professor
rise
capped
it
all
by
saying
it
was
niggly.
in
any
case,
an
outcome,
not
to
be
rested
on
adjectives
or
adverbs,
but
it
said
something
when
in
point
of
policy
every
court
which
comments
on
it
says
the
right
road
is
this
direction
and
somehow
i
am
compelled
to
take
the
other
one.
well,
i
submit
that
that
is
not
a
penultimate
compulsion
for
as
this
court
wrote
the
rule,
it
can
read
the
rule
and
the
reading
of
the
rule
can
match
its
purpose
and
its
purpose
at
least
was
unmistakeable
in
1966.
there
are...
there
is
another
reason.
justice
stevens
by
his
question
noted
that
this
case
belongs
with
misnomers.
now,
there
is
no
state
system
of
procedure
i
know
that
is
today
so
primitive
that
it
would
labor,
much
less
gag,
over
the
correction
of
misnomer.
now,
i
think
there's
something
more
than
anomalous
if
in
1986
in
this
court
a
standard
application,
correction
of
misnomer
as
distinguished
from
other
party
changes
is
when
measured
by
procedural
developments
throughout
the
country,
regressive.
and
yet
that's
what
it
would
be,
at
least
by
comparison.
i
have
already
said
that
in
my
outlook
any
rule,
any
rule
in
this
this
book
which
applies
in
such
a
way
as
to
blemish,
deform,
much
less
screen
out
the
merits
over
procedural
errors
which
are
correctable
without
prejudice--
mr.
morris
m.
schnitzer
--of
course,
and
i
advocate
it,
your
honor.
i
advocate
it
exactly
as
defined
by
the
committee's
comment
in
my
reading,
and
by
judge
feinberg
in
his
reading
of
that,
and
to
other
circuits
as
well,
i.e.
the
very
same
period
of
time
and
not
any
longer
than
would
be
appropriate
to
bring
notice
home
to
this
very
same
party
had
this
very
same
party
been
correctly
named
in
the
first
place,
no
double
standard,
no
endless
stretch-out.
all
things
must
end
including
litigation
and
stages
of
litigation,
but
no
double
standard.
mr.
morris
m.
schnitzer
on
the
contrary,
your
honor.
the
third
circuit
merely
shrugged
and
sighed
and
said,
the
rule
is
too
literally
written
to
allow
us
to
infuse
it
with
some
higher
purpose,
and
i
say
that
no
rule
in
this
book
is
written
in
that
fashion.
mr.
morris
m.
schnitzer
well,
of
course,
your
honor,
because
it
is
part
of
a
system
of
procedure
to
involve
and
to
cope
with
frailties,
not
only
of
the
litigants
which
gives
rise
to
the
meritorious
claims,
but
even
lawyers
who
sometimes
fall
below
the
standard
of
perfection,
as
i'm
sure
i
do
and
have,
and
i
remember
some
of
those
episodes.
now,
the
rules
have
flexibility.
they
were
written
to
have
a
little
give
so
that
the
elbows
are
not
constrained
or
tied
to
the
frame.
they
were
meant
not
to
be
loose,
heaven
forbid,
but
they
were
meant
to
move
slightly,
particularly
in
the
three
classic
instances
which
are
so
familiar
to
any
practitioner,
and
that
is,
you
do
have
misnomer,
there
is
the
oversight
of
forgetting
to
tag
one
additional
party,
and
then
there
are
the
occasions
when
you
aim
the
arrow
at
a,
only
to
learn
later
on
b.
now,
no
system
except
a
narrow
interpretation
of
15-c
bars
that,
has
ever
barred
that,
by
the
way,
past
what
our
former
chief
justice
vanderbilt
used
to
call
the
special
pleading
which
baron
park
made
so
well
known.
so,
our
system,
our
system,
the
federal
civil
practice
system,
is
quite
capable
of
dealing
with
mistakes
and
15-c
was
designed
exactly
to
do
that,
and
the
question
is,
will
it
work.
your
honor,
if
any
time
is
left
i
reserve
it
for
rebuttal.
mr.
morris
m.
schnitzer
your
honor,
may
i
respond
briefly.
page
33-a
of
the
joint
appendix
is
the
letter
of
transmittal
to
corporation
press
company,
the
registered
agent,
and
states
on
may
20th,
only
hours
after
the
statute
of
limitations
had
run
out,
not
even
a
full
day,
"you
will
find
enclosed
herewith
the
summonses
and
complaints
in
the
above
matter
directed
to
fortune."
"as
you
know,
fortune
is
a
publication
of
time
incorporated
and
it
is
for
that
reason
that
we
are
serving
you,
the
new
jersey
registered
agent
for
time
incorporated."
so,
time
incorporated
knew
what
its
registered
agent
knew
and
at
the
same
time,
not
a
full
day
had
elapsed
after
the
statute
had
run
out,
and
knew
that
it
was
intended.
secondly
professor
kaplan
who
was
then
chairman
of
the
advisory
commission
wrote
an
article
in
81
harvard
law
review
referring
to
the
case
which
gave
a
narrow
interpretation
to
the
time
for
notice
to
the
party
would
be
brought
in
and
said
politely
it
was
wrongly
decided.
thirdly,
one
of
the
four
cases
to
which
professor
bise
addressed
himself
in
the
seminal
article
that
gave
rise
to
rule
15-c
is
exactly
this
scenario.
the
facts
are
spelled
out
in
the
opinion.
it
says
a
complaint
was
filed
the
last
day
and
it
follows
that
the
first
notice
to
the
government
came
afterward.
that
was
the
result
to
be
reversed
by
15.
