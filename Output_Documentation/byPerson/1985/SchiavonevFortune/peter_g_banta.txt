mr.
peter
g.
banta
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
petitioners
would
have
this
court,
in
the
guise
of
doing
justice
in
their
particular
cases,
engage
in
a
radical
enterprise,
namely
amending
a
federal
rule
in
the
guise
of
construing
it,
and
establishing
a
principle
which
i
think
is
novel
in
the
federal
rules,
that
the
clear
language
of
the
rules
may
be
disregarded
and
new
language
implied
into
the
rule
when
the
court
might
prefer
the
result
so
obtained
in
a
particular
case.
mr.
peter
g.
banta
i
think
the
second
circuit
has
disagreed
with
it,
and
other
circuits
who
have
implied
the
period
of
reasonable
service
as
an
additional
time.
i
think
that
is
what
they
have
done.
mr.
peter
g.
banta
well,
i
think
we
would
have
had
to
ask
judge
sarakin
that.
we
probably
would
have
contested
it.
when
the
complaint
was
amended
that
was
the
way
it
was
stated
because
the
plaintiffs
then
and
petitioners
now
were
trying
to
gloss
over
the
fact
that
they
had
initially
named
the
party
which
lacked
capacity
and
were
trying
really
to
say
they
had
just
misnamed
a
proper
party
and
were
trying
to
bring
it
within
a
misnomer
rather
than
a
change
of
party
rule.
mr.
peter
g.
banta
let
me
clarify
that.
the
service
was
made
by
a
mailing,
i
think
it
was
made
by
certified
mail
to
one
of
the
corporation
trust
companies
which
was
the
registered
again,
so
addressed
for
time
incorporated.
it
was
sent
under
the
relatively
new
procedure
under
rule
4
with
a
form
of
acknowledgement
of
service
so
that
it
might
be
acknowledged
by
the
person
being
served,
and
that
constitutes
the
consummation
of
service
in
lieu
of
the
old
procedure
of
sending
a
marshal
out.
so
that,
what
happened
when
this
was
received,
as
mr.
schnitzer
indicates,
it
was
transmitted
to
time
which
made
the
judgment
which
was
later
expressed
to
mr.
schnitzer's
co-counsel,
that
the
entity
named
was
not
time.
it
was
not
an
entity
capable
of
being
sued.
therefore
time
incorporated
took
the
position
that
it
was
not
a
proper
party.
it
was
not
named
in
the
suit.
and
therefore
it
refused
to
sign
that
acknowledgement
of
service.
and
this
was
duly
and
promptly
communicated
to
mr.
geiser,
mr.
schnitzer's
colleague,
so
that
there
wa
no
doubt
that
time
had
access
to
and
made
a
copy
of
the
complaint
after
it
was
received,
within
a
few
days
after
it
was
received
and
transmitted
to
them.
the
refusal
which
i
think
mr.
schnitzer
was
relating
to
was
the
refusal
to
acknowledge
proper
service
in
satisfaction
of
rule
4,
and
i
think
that's
just
to
clarify.
mr.
peter
g.
banta
that
is
correct,
and
we
raised
that
issue.
mr.
peter
g.
banta
that
is
correct,
and
judge
sarakin
so
found
because
in
his
order
he
is
referring
to
the
history
that
fortune
is
a
service
mark
and
is
a
publication
and
says,
"as
such,
defendants
contend
that
fortune
lacks
capacity
to
be
sued."
mr.
peter
g.
banta
if
time
under
its
proper
name
had
been
named,
yes.
but
time
was
not
named.
in
fact,
i
just
want
to
finish,
it
says,
"plaintiffs
do
not
urge
that
fortune
has
the
capacity
to
be
sued."
at
the
district
court
level
the
plaintiffs
acknowledged
and
judge
sarakin
found
that
they
had
named
an
entity
not
capable
of
being
sued.
they
had
named
in
effect
a
product,
like
suing
crest
toothpaste
instead
of
colgate
palmolive
or
suing
chevrolet
instead
of--
mr.
peter
g.
banta
--i
don't
think
so.
i
think
that's
a
misdescription
and
under
rule
15-c
and
the
advisory
committee
notes,
misdescriptions
are
included
within
the
definition
of
a
change
of
parties.
mr.
peter
g.
banta
i
was
asked
the
same
question
at
the
third
circuit.
there's
a
point
that's
so
close
that
where
i
think
it's
clear
that
they
have
named--
mr.
peter
g.
banta
--i
think
it's
purely
typographical.
i
think
an
abbreviation
is
de
minimis.
i
don't
know
of
any
cases
dealing
with
it.
mr.
peter
g.
banta
that's
really
a
john
doe
complaint,
and
the
federal
system
has
not
really
sanctioned
john
doe
complaints.
mr.
peter
g.
banta
this
is
in
the
record.
in
the
transmittal
letter
that
accompanied
the
complaint
which
was
sent
by
mr.
schnitzer's
associates,
they
said,
this
is
sent
to
you...
i
am
paraphrasing
now...
in
your
capacity
as
registered
agent
for
time
incorporated
who
are
the
publishers
of
fortune,
the
named
defendant.
so,
that
is
why
the
registered
agent
knew
to
do
it.
mr.
peter
g.
banta
that
is
correct,
yes.
that
letter
was
written--
mr.
peter
g.
banta
--i
think
that's
a
fair
inference.
mr.
peter
g.
banta
that
is
correct.
mr.
peter
g.
banta
that
is
absolutely
correct.
the
statute
was
ruled
to
have
expired
no
later
than
may
19th,
1983,
and
that
was
as
close
as
judge
sarakin
had
to
call
it.
the
mailing
of
the
notice
to
the
registered
agent
took
place
on
the
28th.
it
was
received
on
the
23rd.
there
is
no
question
that
the
initiation
of
process
did
not
occur
until
the
expiration
of
the
statute
and
that's
not
in.
mr.
peter
g.
banta
i
think
it
would
be
irrational,
i
think
partly
because
it
was
never
filed
with
the
court.
i
think
that...
there
have
been
cases
and
i
don't
want
to
press
it
but--
mr.
peter
g.
banta
--i
believe
so,
without
being
able
to
assure--
mr.
peter
g.
banta
--my
recollection
is
that
the
letter
is
in
the
record.
but
i
think
one
of
the
things
that
emerges
is
that
these...
you
will
very
seldom
ever
see
a
case
where
there
are
fewer
equities
on
the
side
of
the
plaintiff.
at
the
same
time
as
this
case
was
initiated,
this
is
in
the
record,
another
case
involving
many
of
the
same
plaintiffs,
same
defendants,
same
defendant's
counsel,
plaintiff's
counsel,
involving
mr.
schiavone
and
time
incorporated,
was
pending
in
the
united
states
district
court
and
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals,
the
same
players
in
a
slightly
different
game
on
a
slightly
different
ball
field.
so
that,
there
is
no
question,
that
complaint
properly
named
the
defendant,
time
incorporated,
happened
to
be
publishing
time
magazine
instead
of
fortune
magazine.
there
is
no
question
that
they
knew...
but
so
that--
mr.
peter
g.
banta
--yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
g.
banta
yes,
it
does.
the
advisory
committee
made
that
very
clear
in
their
statement,
and
i
think
what
they
were
trying
to
do
was
keep
the
district
court
from
having
to
go
through
a
very
difficult
analysis
in
each
case
as
to
whether
a
particular
amendment
really
involved
a
misnomer
or
misdescription
on
the
one
hand,
or
a
change
of
party
on
the
other
with
a
different
outcome
of
rule.
i
think
the
record,
or
the
inference
from
what
the
advisory
committee
did,
is
to
say,
we're
going
to
lump
these
all
together
and
the
same
rule
applies
to
them
all,
and
avoid
that
determination.
mr.
peter
g.
banta
well,
i
think
the
misnomer
cases,
there
was
a
problem
and
that
is
that
it
was
the
second
corporation
with
the
name
of
the
misnamed
corporation.
mr.
peter
g.
banta
i
think
this--
mr.
peter
g.
banta
--there
might
be
other
questions,
if
time
had
used
time
inc.
in
various
publications--
mr.
peter
g.
banta
--i
think
one
of
the
problems
with
time
inc.
is,
i
think
time
inc.
has
used
its
name
in
both
forms
and
fashions
and
there
would
be
at
least
an
estoppel
involved
in
that
misnomer,
and
i
think
an
estoppel--
mr.
peter
g.
banta
--well,
i
think
that
the
courts
have
looked
to
defendant's
conduct
as
misleading
plaintiffs,
and
where
that
has
been
a
material
issue
they
have
felt
that
they
have
the
power--
mr.
peter
g.
banta
--i
think
this
issue...
well,
the
third
circuit
said
it
didn't
have
to
pass
on
the
issue.
mr.
peter
g.
banta
certainly,
literally
applied
it
does,
an
ampersand
instead
of
an
"and",
something
that's
even
pronounced
the
same.
our
position
is
that
the
effect
of
rule
15-c
the
way
it
is
construed
by
us
and
the
way
has
been
adopted,
is
to
do
two
things.
it
is
to
say
plaintiffs,
in
effect,
there
are
two
ways
you
can
perfect
you
claim
against
the
defendant.
the
first
is
properly
to
name
the
defendant
in
its
proper
corporate
name
or
individual
name,
spelled
right,
whatever,
and
to
file
this
complaint
with
the
court
within
the
period
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
or,
there
is
an
alternate
way
of
perfecting
the
claim
and
this
is
the
way
that
15-c
provides,
and
that
is
to
file
complaint,
possibly
misnaming
of
original...
the
proper
party,
so
called,
to
be
served,
spelling
it,
to
file
this
complaint
but
within
the
period
of
before
the
expiration
of
the
statute
of
limitations,
to
give
actual
notice
of
the
lawsuit,
in
effect
to
the
proper
party
to
be
served
and
then
your
amendment
to
correct
will
relate
back.
and,
15-c
really
provides
additional
alternate
ways
for
plaintiffs
to
perfect
their
belief,
their
complaint.
it
does
not
go
so
far
as
mr.
schnitzer
says,
and
that's
why
we're
here
today,
but
it
is
not
a
double
standard
in
the
language
he
says.
it
is
an
alternate
way
for
plaintiffs
who
have
misnamed
defendants,
who
involve
the
naming
of
a
wrong
party,
a
subsidiary
of
a
parent,
a
brother-sister
corporation
situation.
it
is
a
way
for
plaintiffs
to
cure
that.
the
advisory
committee
was
very
clear
that
they
felt
that
this
notice
should
be
given
within
the
period
of
the
statute
of
limitations,
and
they
said
in
their
advisory
note,
they
mean
the
limitations
period.
so
that,
i
think
the
arguments
that
mr.
schnitzer
raises
are
good
legislative
arguments
to
be
addressed
to
a
rulemaking
body,
to
the
advisory
committee,
to
the
judicial
conference,
and
they
certainly
have
some
appeal
there
and
might
be
grounds
for
consideration
of
any
amendment,
but
to
imply
this
reasonable
period
of
service
test
into
the
clear
language
and
in
the
face
of
the
advisory
committee
report,
appears
to
cause
a
very
serious
problem,
that
the
rule
does
not
longer
mean
what
it
says.
then,
you
still
have
the
same
problem
of
whether
service
was
timely
made
within
whatever
reasonable
period
of
service
is
made,
and
you're
going
to
have
determinations
for
district
judges
as
to
whether
service
was
timely.
even
in
the
ingram
v.
kumar
case
which
was
referred
to,
the
service
was
not
within
120
days
at
the
time,
and
so
you
still
have
district
judges
passing
on
the
adequacy
of
service
down
the
road.
so,
i
think
that
the
plaintiffs
now
under
rule
4,
allowing
for
the
initiation
of
process
by
mailing,
have
it
within
their
power
to
get
a
summons
out
promptly.
they
are
not
at
the
mercy
of
the
marshal
not
serving.
they
now
have
control
over
the
timing
of
service
so
they
are
not
at
the
mercy
of
the
marshal's
negligence
depriving
them
of
the
benefit
of
15-c
by
failing
to
serve
in
time.
so,
that
benefit
and
that
opportunity
was
given.
i'm
not
contending
that
our
refusal
to
acknowledge
would
defeat
15-c
if
that
were
the
case.
i
think
that
service
probably
for
15-c
purposes
would
be
good
if
it
were
timely
because
it
furnishes
actual
notice.
whether
it's
acknowledgement
for
rule
4
purposes
is
one
matter,
but
it
certainly
is
actual
notice
for
purposes
of
15-c.
the
policies
of
the
statute
of
limitations
section
have
not
really
been
touched
on.
they
are
definitely
in
the
back
of
the
consideration
and
statutes
of
limitations
frustrate
decisions
on
the
merits.
they
serve
another
policy,
and
any
plaintiffs
who
tiptoe
right
up
to
the
edge
of
the
statute
of
limitations
before
they
take
their
actions
run
the
risk
of
running
afoul
of
the
statute
of
limitations
and
unfortunately
it
happens
all
the
time,
and
i
am
afraid
will
probably
continue
to
happen.
the
results
may
sometimes
be
different
from
what
state
law
provides,
but
we
are
in
a
federal
system,
we
have
federal
rules,
federal
causes
of
action
and
so
that,
i
think
there
is
no...
and
this
court
has
already
ruled
that
in
procedural
rules,
in
hanna
versus
plummer,
there
is
no
necessity
that
the
outcomes
be
the
same
as
in
the
state
courts.
even
back
on
the
history,
the
impetus,
i
think
is
clear,
came
from
professor
bise's
article
referring
to
the
four
suits.
those
were
suits
against
the
government,
and
that's
a
very
thorny,
difficult
area.
it's
not
one
our
case
is
specifically
concerned
with.
i
know
this
court
has...
the
cooper
case
came
up,
seeking
certification
within
the
year.
other
cases
may
come
along,
short
statutes
of
limitation,
some
confusion
probably
among
practitioners
as
to
who
the
proper
party
is
to
be
sued.
it's
a
difficult
area.
rule
15-c
has
special
rules
to
deal
with
that
which
help
to
ease
that
particular
question.
they
provide
that
the
service
in
this
limitations
period
can
be
accomplished
by
mailing.
all
you
have
to
do
is
mail
within
the
limitations
period
and
the
government
is
bound,
which
is
somewhat
broader.
and
it
also
provides
that
you
serve
the
attorney
general
od
the
u.s.
attoreny.
even
if
the
substantive
cause
of
action
requires
both,
even
service
on
one
would
be
sufficient.
it
also
provides
that
service
on
a
proper
agent
for
service
counts
if
he
would
have
been
an
agent
for
the
defendant
properly
named.
if
you
name
the
united
states
postal
service
and
serve
the
u.s.
attorney,
he
cannot
come
in
and
say,
well,
that's
improper
service
and
the
proper
party
was
the
united
states
of
america,
and
while
i
could
be
served
on
belief
of
the
united
states
of
america
i
was
served
in
a
different
capacity
for
the
postal
service
and
that
is
invalid.
that
issue
in
fact
was
raised
in
the
edwards
case
cited
in
our
brief
and
was
rejected.
so
there
is
definitely
much
relief
for
litigants
in
the
context
of
federal
causes
of
action.
mr.
peter
g.
banta
absolutely.
there
is
no
question.
mr.
peter
g.
banta
the
timeliness
of
the
notice
to
the
government
is
absolutely
crucial,
and
that
is
in
our
briefs.
it
goes
right
back
to
the
beginning
of
rule
15-c
and
the
amendments,
and
professor
bise
even
comments
in
his
article
on,
that
the
government
received
notice
within
the
limitation
period.
so
that,
he
was
concerned
about
the
technicalities
of
naming
the
wrong
party,
but
if
you
serve
the
right
party
he
was
willing
to
feel
that
there
should
be
a
rule
overlooking
the
technicalities
of
naming
the
secretary
who
just
left
office
rather
than
the
incumbent,
or
something
along
those
lines.
so
that,
our
position
is
that
rule
15-c
is
workable.
it's
very
important
that
it
be
applied
as
it
reads.
the
implication
that's
asked
for
mr.
schnitzer,
namely
the
additional
period
of
service,
the
ingram
rule,
is
really
grafting
a
whole
additional
concept
onto
the
rule
which
is
appropriate
to
be
done...
i'm
not
saying
it
is...
would
have
to
be
done
in
a
legislative
context.
the
rulemaking
process,
the
rule's
enabling
act,
that

this
rule
was
submitted
to
the
bar
20
years
ago
with
a
whole
year
for
comment
prior
to
its
adoption.
the
issue
that
we're
now
in
litigation
on
was
raised
in
the
martz
case
while
the
rule
was
pending,
yet
no
changes
were
made
in
the
rule
at
the
time.
so,
the
issue
is
one
that
we
can
hardly
say
came
up
and
caught
everyone
by
surprise.
so,
for
these
reasons
we
feel
that
the
should
confirm
the
judgments
below
and
find
in
favor
of
our
client,
time
incorporated.
