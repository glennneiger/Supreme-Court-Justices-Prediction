mr.
donald
l.
flexner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
court
has
never
allowed
plaintiffs
to
end
run
the
interstate
commerce
act
by
taking
their
rate
complaints
to
the
courts
instead
of
to
the
commission.
the
court
has
always
read
the
interstate
commerce
act
to
mean
that
a
shipper
who
thinks
he
is
paid
too
much
money
must
take
that
complaint
to
the
expert
agency,
and
antitrust
cases
have
been
no
exception
to
the
rule,
and
you
can
easily
see
why.
if
a
plaintiff
could
easily
have
chosen
to
go
after
treble
damages
and
attorneys'
fees
and
to
argue
technical
rate
issues
to
a
lay
jury
instead
of
to
the
expert
agency
that
congress
created
to
regulate
rates,
there
would
have
been
little
incentive
to
go
to
the
commission,
but
congress
wanted
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
not
the
antitrust
laws
and
not
the
courts
to
regulate
and
govern
the
legality
of
rates,
and
if
shippers
could
have
gone
to
courts,
that
congressional
policy
would
have
been
defeated,
and
that
is
why
keogh
was
decided
the
way
it
was,
and
that
is
why
it
should
be
reaffirmed
and
not
only
ruled.
now,
we
have
three
specific
reasons
which
i
can
briefly
summarize
why
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
donald
l.
flexner
that
is
precisely
right,
your
honor.
if
the
court's
interpretation
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
keogh
in
georgia
was
wrong,
and
no
one
here
contends
that
it
was
wrong,
congress
has
had
those
cases
in
front
of
it
for
over
60
years,
and
is
in
a
position
to
correct
the
law,
and
this
has
been
an
area
of
intense
congressional
activity.
in
fact,
the
government
has
now
proposed
that
all
motor
carrier
legislation
be
repealed,
and
congress
is
considering
that
legislation
as
well
as--
mr.
donald
l.
flexner
--i
do
not,
your
honor.
i
think--
mr.
donald
l.
flexner
--that
is
the
government's
argument,
but
i
think
that
is
insufficient
except
as
a
policy
rationale
addressed
to
the
congress
to
justify
overturning
60
years
of
established
precedent,
and
we
think,
your
honor,
that
this
case
simply
can't
be
distinguished
from
keogh
and
georgia,
as
hard
as
petitioners
have
tried,
number
one.
number
two,
congress
has
never
overruled
this
court's
interpretation
in
those
cases,
and
number
three,
the
policy
arguments
that
the
government
makes
about
competition
being
the
order
of
the
day
and
such
ought
to
be
addressed
to
congress,
which
has
the
issue
before
it
now.
i
would
like
to
take
those
points
in
order,
if
i
may.
very
briefly,
it
is
flatly
incorrect
to
say
that
the
rates
at
issue
in
keogh
and
georgia
were
the
product
or
were
made
in
compliance
with
the
regulatory
plan.
those
rates
were
the
result
of
per
se
illegal
naked
price
fixing
conspiracy
and
collusion
that
was
not
approved
by
the
commission,
that
was
beyond
the
power
of
the
commission
to
approve
and
immunize.
the
complaint
in
the
georgia
case
called
those
willful
violations,
said
they
flouted
icc
procedures,
they
were
outside
of
the
express
immunity
contained
in
certificate
44,
which
was
the
wartime
immunity,
and
the
court
recognized
that
government
prosecutions
would
be
adequate
to
deal
with
those
kinds
of
illegal
forms
of
agreements
because
it
would
not
interfere
with
the
heart
of
the
commission's
discretion
over
rates.
but
treble
damages
would
have
the
opposite
effect.
treble
damages
as
administered
by
the
courts
would
involve
the
courts
in
a
forbidden
pursuit,
namely
deciding
what
rates
other
than
the
file
rate
would
be
lawful,
and
that
was
a
decision
that
congress
wanted
the
commission
to
make,
and
set
up
specific
statutory
standards
and
procedures
and
remedies
that
were
just
plain
different
from
the
standards
and
remedies
and
procedures
under
the
antitrust
laws.
so,
it
is
wrong
to
say
that
our
position
is
not
based
on
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
the
statute
defines
specifically
what
rate
it
is
that
a
shipper
is
entitled
to,
and
it
is
a
just
and
reasonable
and
nondiscriminatory
rate.
it
is
not
the
competitive
just
and
reasonable
and
nondiscriminatory
rate.
it
is
not
the
lowest
reasonable
and
nondiscriminatory
rate.
it
is
just
what
it
says,
and
there
is
no
necessary
relationship
between
a
violation
of
a
rate
bureau
procedure
and
whether
that
rate
is
just
and
reasonable.
that
is
an
issue
for
the
commission
to
decide,
and
in
fact
in
the
wheat
rail
case
the
commission
found
that
even
though
there
was
a
rate
bureau
violation,
there
had
not
been
injury
caused
to
the
shipper,
and
the
commission
refused
to
retroactively
nullify
or
abrogate
that
rate,
and
that
decision
by
the
commission
was
cited
with
approval
by
this
court
in
the
ata
decision
when
it
upheld
a
new
administrative
remedy
for
shippers
to
redress
rate
bureau
violations
and
to
receive
what
this
court
thought
was
potentially
ruinous.
mr.
donald
l.
flexner
well,
justice
o'connor,
there
is
no
statutory
provision
that
authorizes
that
procedure.
this
court
has
three
times,
if
i
remember
correctly,
considered
the
question
of
a
referral
of
complicated
rate
issues
in
a
situation
where
a
plaintiff
is
trying
to
create
a
cause
of
action
in
court
that
congress
had
not
itself
authorized,
and
on
those
occasions,
in
keogh
itself,
in
1951,
in
montana-dakota,
and
in
1959
in
this
court's
decision
in
the
t.i.m.e.
case,
the
court
found
that
the
issue
is
one
of
legislative
intent,
not...
and
refused
to
allow
a
procedure
to
be
gerryrigged
in
order
to
create
a
cause
of
action
that
congress
had
decided
it
wanted
to
rest
exclusively
with
the
agency.
and,
your
honor,
i
must
say
that
this
case
shows
what
a
mess--
mr.
donald
l.
flexner
--justice
o'connor,
i
think
there
is
an
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
it
is
congruent
with
what
congress
wanted
the
commission
to
do.
congress
said
there
is
a
two-year
period
within
which
you
can
consider
it,
whether
rates
are
lawful
or
unlawful
under
the
standards
of
the
act,
which
is
the
point
of
the
referral.
this
case
involves
16
years.
there
are
other
cases
out
there,
justice
o'connor,
that
involve
25
or
30
years.
so
i
think
we
are
talking
about
a
procedure
which
would
be
such
a
mess
for
the
courts
and
would
leave
so
many
unanswered
questions
in
terms
of
where
our
appeal
rights
were,
were
they
from
the
commission
decision,
was
the
commission's
decision
advisory,
do
we
submit
it
to
the
jury,
do
we
argue
contrary
facts
to
the
jury,
do
we
appeal
from
the
jury
verdict?
none
of
those
questions
have
been
addressed
by
this
court,
and
certainly
they
have
not
been
addressed
by
the
congress,
and
we
think
that
in
a
statute
which
is
supposed
to
provide
certain
continuity,
and
where
congress
has
clearly
laid
out
a
map
or
a
guidepost
for
remedies,
and
where
this
court
has
refused
to
authorize
this
kind
of
a
detailed
referral
procedure
on
rates,
this
would
be
a
bad
case
to
do
that.
mr.
donald
l.
flexner
i
meant
to
say,
justice
rehnquist,
that
while
the
rates
themselves
could
be
approved,
the
agreement
from
which
the
rates
arose
was
beyond
the
authority
of
the
commission
to
approve
or
disapprove,
so
they
were
the...
not
rates
made
in
compliance
with
the
regulatory
plan,
but
they
were
the
product
of
a
conspiracy
which
the
court
at
that
time
said
was
settled
as
illegal
under
the
antitrust
law.
mr.
donald
l.
flexner
they
were,
your
honor,
but
of
course
in
the
georgia
case
the
rates
had
neither
been
approved,
and
indeed,
as
here,
were
labeled
coercive--
mr.
donald
l.
flexner
--that
is
exactly
right,
your
honor,
and,
of
course,
the
defendants
in
this
case
have
been
sued
by
the
government
and
are
subject
to
very
stringent
injunctive
provisions.
the
point
that
is
raised
about
retaining
the
illegal
fruits
of
the
conspiracy
is
just
wrong,
and
it
really
is
just
a
rehash
of
the
argument
that
was
made
in
keogh
itself.
in
keogh,
the
plaintiff
said,
we
are
not
limited
to
the
rights
that
we
have
under
the
interstate
commerce
act.
we
are
entitled
to
the
competitive
rate
that
the
antitrust
laws
allow
us,
and
the
report
in
the
broadest
possible
language
said,
no,
your
entitlements
are
defined
comprehensively
and
in
a
self-contained
way
by
the
interstate
commerce
act.
now,
you
take
this
case.
we
say
that
the
shippers
had
remedies
and
advantages
that
have
no
counterpart
in
the
antitrust
laws.
they
could...
each
time
a
rate
went
into
effect
throughout
the
year
of
this
alleged
conspiracy
have
complained
to
the
commission.
they
could
have
asked
that
the
commission
suspend
the
rates.
they
could
have
asked
for
an
investigation.
they
could
have
raised
every
argument
that
they
thought
was
reasonable
to
raise.
and
assuming
that
there
was
a
procedural
argument
that
they
couldn't
think
to
make,
which
is
what
they
allege
here,
in
june
of
1983,
when
they
brought
this
antitrust
case,
what
congress
said
they
should
have
done
was
go
to
the
commission,
and
what
they
should
have
argued
is
what
they
are
arguing
here,
and
the
commission's
remedies
would
have
been
whatever
they
were.
they
could
have
disapproved
the
rate.
they
could
have
cancelled
the
rate
and
put
a
new
rate
in
prospectively.
mr.
donald
l.
flexner
our
position,
justice
stevens,
is
that
congress
set
about
to
comprehensively
define
all
the
remedies
that
shippers
would
have.
mr.
donald
l.
flexner
that
is
exactly--
mr.
donald
l.
flexner
--that
is
exactly
right,
and
i
must
say--
mr.
donald
l.
flexner
--i
would
certainly
concede
that
the
commission
doesn't
have
treble
damages
and
attorneys'
fees.
mr.
donald
l.
flexner
but
the
point
of
their
argument
is
that
somehow
this
is
because
the
remedy
is
different
from
before
the
commission
than
it
is
what
they
would
like
under
the
antitrust
laws,
that
that
is
"unfair".
mr.
donald
l.
flexner
your
honor,
i
think
the
answer
is
that
under
the
new
act,
the
motor
carrier
act,
under
nullification
authority,
perhaps
they
could
nullify
tariffs
that
were
in
effect
in
taking
the
rate
back
to
the
preexisting
level,
but
the
point
is
that
congress
set
up
a
scheme
in
which
shippers
on
a
day-to-day
basis
had
rights
that
had
no
counterpart
in
the
antitrust
laws.
in
other
words,
you
or
a
shipper--
mr.
donald
l.
flexner
--that
is
exactly
right,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
l.
flexner
they
are
barred.
mr.
donald
l.
flexner
they
had
the
remedy.
mr.
donald
l.
flexner
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
because
that...
because
we
are
talking
about
a
two-year
statute
of
limitations--
mr.
donald
l.
flexner
--i
don't
know,
your
honor.
all
i
know
is--
mr.
donald
l.
flexner
--well,
i
think,
your
honor,
there
may
be
an
argument
that
the
commission
can
decide
that
that
is
available
to
them.
in
the
wheat
rail
case,
they
considered
under
a
different
statute
whether
or
not
a
rate
bureau
violation
which
the
plaintiffs
contended
resulted
in
an
unlawful
rate
justified
retroactively
nullifying
the
tariff,
and
they
concluded
that
in
the
circumstances
of
that
case,
there
was
no
injury,
and
it
was
not
justified,
and
therefore
the
rate
should
be
only
cancelled
prospectively.
so,
the
commission
has
wide
discretion,
and
i
think
the
point
to
be
made,
justice
white
and
justice
stevens,
is
that
the
commission
created
a
set
of
unique
rights
in
shippers
that
the
antitrust
laws
just
don't
give
to
anyone.
they
give
shippers
the
right
to
know
what
rate
is
in
effect
at
all
times.
they
give
them
a
30-day
lead
time
before
it
goes
into
effect,
and
the
point
is
that
what
is
fair
or
not
fair
as
decided
by
congress
and
this
court
in
the
t.i.m.e.
case
concluded
that
it
wasn't
going
to
substitute
its
judgment
for
congress's
on
the
delicate
balance
of
shipper
interests
and
carrier
interests,
and
recognize
that
even
though
in
that
case
the
shipper,
which
happened
to
be
the
united
states,
might
be
without
a
remedy,
that
the
fact
that
it
was
without
a
remedy
was
a
deliberate
choice
by
congress,
and
it
would
therefore
not
be
a
justification
for
substituting
a
court
action
which
would
only
interfere
with
the
commission's
jurisdiction,
and
so
we
don't
think
you
can
distinguish
your
way
out
from
under
keogh
and
georgia.
we
think
that
the
facts
of
those
cases
and
their
rationale
clearly
apply
here,
and
the
proposition
that
is
presented
is
that
the
reed-bullwinkle
act
overruled
those
decisions.
here
we
say
that
the
enforcement
agencies,
the
department
of
justice
and
the
department
of
transportation
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
which
after
all
is
bound
to
interpret
and
imply
that
statute,
have
said
in
their
briefs
that
reed-bullwinkle
did
not
overrule
keogh.
the
lower
courts
that
have
looked
at
this
issue
agree
with
that
position.
and
we
think
that
the
legislative
history,
as
judge
friendly
analyzed
it,
shows
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
overrule
keogh,
but
rather
to
augment
it,
but
the
problem
is
government
prosecution
and
the
lack
of
agency
authority
to
regulate
rate
bureaus,
and
it
was
not
keogh,
because
keogh
after
all
was
intended
to
protect
the
rate
authority
of
the
commission
and
those
special
powers
as
the
process
by
which
rates
got
set,
and
there
was
no
reason
therefore
for
congress
to
want
to
overrule
a
statutory
interpretation
that
only
served
to
carry
out
its
intent,
and
there
is
a
remarkably
clear
statement
in
the
legislative
history,
i
think,
which
underscores
that
point.
the
congress
says,
look,
we
understand
that
the
antitrust
laws
are
not
necessary
to
regulate
rates,
and
the
reason
they
are
not
necessary
to
regulate
rates
is
that
we
have
cloaked
a
government
authority,
with
the
power
to
decide
that
question.
and
so
the
antitrust
laws
don't
apply
in
that
area,
and
we
think
that
is
a
particularly
powerful
statement
in
light
of
the
history
that...
the
history
that
judge
friendly
reviewed.
now,
they
don't
make
the
petitioners
any
more
of
the
motor
carrier
act
of
1980,
and
the
reason
they
don't
make
anything
of
that
act
is
that
that
act
is
forward
looking,
and
their
case
seeks
to
reach
back
over
a
16-year
period
and
apply
treble
damages
and
attorneys'
fees
with
respect
to
rates
that
are
ancient
history,
that
were
made
and
carried
out
under
the
old
rule
that
i
should
say
were
always
subject
to
and
contained
in
filed
tariffs
that
were
required
to
be
paid
and
were
the
exclusive
means
by
which
carrier
and
shipper
relationships
were
carried
out
in
the
market.
and
they
don't
rely
on
the
motor
carrier
act
for
a
second
reason,
and
that
is
that
congress
made
a
deliberate
decision
in
that
act
to
retain
the
full
ratemaking
powers
of
the
commission
which
this
court
interpreted
in
keogh
and
georgia
as
requiring
shippers
to
use
those
powers
and
not
the
antitrust
laws
to
resolve
disputes
over
rates.
mr.
donald
l.
flexner
reparations,
your
honor,
and
after
the
1980
act
they
can...
and
this
court's
decision
in
ata,
there
is
now
an
additional
remedy
for
shippers,
which
is
the
remedy
to
nullify
the
existing
tariff--
mr.
donald
l.
flexner
--that
is
exactly
right,
because--
mr.
donald
l.
flexner
--well,
i
would
say
that
would
be
for
the
commission
to
decide.
mr.
donald
l.
flexner
if
the
commission
made
that
decision,
your
honor--
mr.
donald
l.
flexner
--there
would
be
no
reparations,
and
it
would
be
because
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
defined
what
rate
is
legal
and
what
the
shipper
is
entitled
to,
and
the
commission
and
the
courts
are
bound
by
that
plain
language,
and
in
fact
when
the
petitioners
get
up
and
they
say
we
would
like
to
put
an
expert
on
the
stand
who
is
going
to
testify
that
there
was
a
competitive
rate
out
here
that
would
have
been
charged
but
for
this
alleged
procedural
violation,
and
we
are
entitled
to
a
presumption
that
it
falls
within
this
broad
band
of...
reasonableness,
to
do
that,
this
court
would
have
to
overrule
keogh,
montana-dakota,
and
arkdin,
all
of
which
stand
for
the
proposition
that
a
court
may
not
assume
anything
about
how
a
commission
would
apply
a
zone
to
a
particular
rate.
that
is
an
adjudicatory
function
assigned
by
the
congress
to
an
expert
agency.
mr.
donald
l.
flexner
that,
your
honor,
i
can
say
i
know
that
is
not
this
case,
and
it
may
be
some
future
case.
if
you
proceed--
mr.
donald
l.
flexner
--and
if
you
proceeded
on
that
basis
given
the
court's
decision
in
ata,
you
proceed
at
your
own
risk,
but
this
is
a
case
in
which
there
is
no
dispute
but
that
the
rates
were--
mr.
donald
l.
flexner
--i
think
under
this
court's
opinions,
your
honor,
on
the
stay
and
deferral
procedure,
it
would
not.
so
we
say,
your
honor,
that
where
we
are
now
is
that
there
has
been
a
settled
interpretation
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
that
has
been
an
integral
part
of
the
law
for
60
years.
no
one
has
said
that
the
court
was
wrong
in
its
initial
interpretation
of
the
act.
there
is
no
confusion
in
the
law.
the
lower
courts
have
clearly
understood
where
shippers
must
go
to
resolve
their
rate
disputes,
and
here,
the
petitioners
are
asking
for
a
fundamental
change
in
an
area
of
rate
regulation
despite
the
fact
that
this
is
an
area
where
congress
has
moved
very
carefully,
step
by
step,
balancing
the
relationship
between
the
ports
and
the
agency,
and
as
important,
between
shippers
and
between
carriers,
and
if
this
delicate
balance
is
to
be
changed,
we
think
that
congress
is
the
proper
body
to
do
it.
mr.
donald
l.
flexner
it
defined
the
circumstances,
your
honor,
in
which
the
government
could
prosecute.
mr.
donald
l.
flexner
it
created
an
express
immunity
because
when
you
read
the
legislative
history,
it
is
clear
that
the
need
for
the
legislation
was
to
create
certainty
where
government
prosecutions
had
been
creating--
mr.
donald
l.
flexner
--oh,
we
would
contend
it
does
apply,
your
honor,
and
i
must
say--
mr.
donald
l.
flexner
--we
do,
your
honor.
i
mean,
we
have
answered
the
complaint.
mr.
donald
l.
flexner
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
l.
flexner
i
believe
so,
your
honor,
and
the
reason
i
do
is
the
legislative
history
makes
it
clear
that
with
respect
to
rate
levels
and
whether
particular
rates
that
arise
out
of
what
we
have
been
calling
a
procedural
violation
violate
the
act
because
they
are
unreasonable
or
discriminatory,
that
is
a
matter
that
can
only
be
decided
by
the
commission
according
to
those
special
standards,
and
there
is
no
necessary
relationship
between
the
procedural
violation
and
whether
that
legal
entitlement
has
been
undermined,
and
that,
it
seems
to
us,
is
the
key.
that
is
why
keogh
made
sense
in
the
breadth
in
which
it
was
decided.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you
very
much.
