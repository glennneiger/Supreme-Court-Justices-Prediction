justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
this
question?
if
there
had
been
no
violation
of
the
filed
rate
schedules,
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
the
case
either,
but
if
the
filed
rates
had
been
specifically
approved
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
would
you
be
here?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
assuming
no
violation.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
understand
the
icc
has
not
approved
this
particular
rate
schedule.
it
rarely
approves
them
as
a
matter
of
practice,
but
does
the
mere
filing
of...
if
the
rates
have
been
filed
and
not
violated...
that
was
my
original
question...
i
take
it
you
would
still
be
here.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
would
still
be
here.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
the
allegations
of
ignoring
their
own
rate
schedule
are
not
essential
to
your
claims.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
wallace,
just
one
quick
question.
does
your
argument
apply
equally
to
railroad
carriers?
this
is
a
motor
carrier
case.
