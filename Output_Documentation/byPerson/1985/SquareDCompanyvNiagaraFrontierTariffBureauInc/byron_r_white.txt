justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
have
any
remedy
at
all
before
the
icc?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that,
but--
justice
byron
r.
white
--why
couldn't
you
get
relief
before
the
icc?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
statute
probably
wasn't
running,
then,
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
go
ahead.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
else--
justice
byron
r.
white
--what
would
be
your
measure
of
damages?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
in
this
antitrust
case
what
would
you
measure
your
damages
by?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
would
you
know
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
would
you
decide
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't
have
to
resort
to
the
icc
at
all
to
establish
what
a
reasonable
rate
would
have
been?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
answer
to
the
question?
are
you
asking
keogh
be
overruled
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
--your
position
would
be
the
same
in
this
case
if
the
icc
had
instituted
an
investigation
of
some
of
these
rates
and
specifically
approved
them,
found
them
to
be
within
the
zone
of
reasonableness.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
you
would
still
say
that
a
suit
for
damages
would
lie.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
say
even
though
the
icc
had
approved
the
rate,
the
rates
might
have
been
lower
except
for
the
conspiracy.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
the
measure
of
damages
in
that
situation
would
be
the
difference
between
what
the
rate
might
have
been
and
the
rate
that
was
charged?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
if
the
rates
had
been
lower,
if
there
hadn't
been
a
conspiracy,
and
the
rate
had
been
lower,
all
the
competitors
would
have
been
paying
a
lower
rate,
too,
so
how
would
there
have
been
damage
to
the
business
and
property?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
nevertheless
the
rates
were
reasonable
rates
and
were
approved?
justice
byron
r.
white
keogh
itself
said
or
assumed
or
stated
that
the
government
could
get
after
the
conspirators.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
there
any...
what
could
the
commission...
what
could
the
commission
do
about
rates
that
are
no
longer
in
effect?
i
suppose
the
rates
have
been
changed
over
the
years,
and
a
lot
of
the
rates
that
they
are
complaining
about
are
no
longer
in
effect.
what
could
the
commission
do
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
if
these
people
claim
they
were
hurt
by
a
rate
that
was
set
ten
years
ago
and
was
in
effect
for
two
years,
that
is
just
tough,
they
should
have
gotten
after
it
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
they
are
just
barred.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
they
have
no
remedy.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
have
no
remedy
before
the
commission
except
with
respect
to
a
rate
that
is
now
in
effect.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
if
the
commission
as
far
as
money
is
concerned
could
only
give
reparations.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
may
be
so,
but
as
far
as
money
is
concerned,
there
would
be
reparations
then,
but
reparations
would
only
be
given
if
the
rate
was
unreasonable.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
say
that
if
these
conspiratorial...
if
these
rates
which
were
set
by
a
conspiracy
turned
out
to
be
reasonable,
there
wouldn't
be
any
relief
before
the
commission.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
they
would
decide...
they
would
say,
well,
certainly
these
carriers
didn't
abide
by
the
right
procedures
to
sake
joint
rates,
but
nevertheless
the
rates
they
came
up
with
were
within
the
zone
of
reasonableness.
no
reparations.
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
reparation.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
the
bullwinkle
act
do
about
antitrust
immunity?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
nobody
else?
it
gave
express
antitrust
immunity.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
is
no
argument
in
this
case
that
that
express
immunity
would
apply.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
insist
that
you
complied
with
the
procedures?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
it
were
proved
that
you
did
not
comply,
that
your
clients
did
not
comply
with
those
procedures,
there
would
be
no
express
immunity.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
immunity
that
they
were
talking
about
was
just
immunity
from
government
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
--you
say
reed-bullwinkle
was
a
congressional
effort
to--
justice
byron
r.
white
--comprehensively
deal
with
this.
you
would
think
that
you
would
find
more
evidence
that
they
intended
to
overrule
keogh.
justice
byron
r.
white
after
all,
keogh
was
a
case
of
statutory
construction.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
certainly
wasn't
a
constitutional
law
case,
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so--
justice
byron
r.
white
--the
statutory
construction
had
been
on
the
books
a
long
time,
and
here
comes
reed-bullwinkle.
you
would
think
congress
would
have
dealt
specifically
with
private
antitrust
actions
if
it
was
dealing
with
the
cold
question
of
antitrust
immunity.
