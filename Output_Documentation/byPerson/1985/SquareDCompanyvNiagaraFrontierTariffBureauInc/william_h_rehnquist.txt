if
they
violated
the

the
interstate
commerce
commission?
justice

rehnquist
there
is
no
possibility
of
reparations
then
from

mr.
flexner,
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
in
keogh
the
rates
proposed
by
the
defendants
there
could
not
have
been
approved
by
the
commission.
why
is
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
makes
you
think
the
commission
wouldn't
apply
some
tolling
doctrine
if
there
is
an
allegation
of
conspiracy
and
concealment?
