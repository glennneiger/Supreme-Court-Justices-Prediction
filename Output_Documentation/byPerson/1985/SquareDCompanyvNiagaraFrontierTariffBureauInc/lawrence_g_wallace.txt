mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
complaints
in
this
case
were
dismissed
to
seek
recovery
for
damages
under
the
sherman
act,
alleging
that
the
respondents
had
engaged
in
conduct
that
was
not
approved
and
could
not
be
approved
by
the
icc.
the
charged
concerted
price
fixing
activity
is
outside
the
scope
of
collaboration
that
is
authorized
and
immunized
from
the
antitrust
laws
by
the
reed-bullwinkle
act,
and
it
is
well
established
that
the
conduct
charged
is
subject
to
the
proscriptions
of
the
antitrust
laws.
that
has
been
true
since
the
trans-missouri
and
joint
traffic
association
cases,
and
was
recognized
again
in
georgia
against
pennsylvania
railroad,
and
indeed,
the
government
brought
a
suit
to
enjoin
much
of
the
conduct
that
is
at
issue
in
these
complaints,
and
a
consent
decree
was
entered
against
that
conduct,
so
the
question
in
the
case
is
not
whether
the
alleged
conduct
is
immunized
from
the
antitrust
laws,
it
is
whether
there
is
adequate
reason
for
a
more
limited
implied
immunity
only
from
damage
suits
by
shippers
injured
by
the
alleged
violation
of
the
anti-trust
laws.
in
other
words,
whether
there
is
adequate
reason
why
carriers
who
have
violated
both
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
the
sherman
act
must
be
allowed
to
retain
the
fruits
of
their
violation,
and
the
sherman
act
violation
is
a
crime,
i
will
remind
the
courts.
they
must
be
allowed
to
retain
those
fruits
as
against
injured
persons
who
are
within
the
class
that
congress
sought
to
protect
in
both
of
those
statutes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
commerce
commission
can
revoke
tariffs
that
have
been
secured
in
violation
of
the
kind
of
collaboration
that
is
authorized
by
reed-bullwinkle.
and
if
there
is
an
overcharge
as
against
the
charge
that
the
tariff
authorizes,
an
order
can
be
entered
to
give
reparations
for
the
overcharge,
and
that
would
be
enforceable
in
court,
and
there
is
a
court
action
for
reparations
against
unreasonable
rates
under
the
act
in
a
statute
that
congress
passed
to
overrule
this
court's
decision
in
t.i.m.e.,
but
if
the
tariff
has
not
been
violated
and
the
rate
charged
is
within
the
zone
of
reasonableness,
the
icc
does
not
have
a
remedy
to
recompense
shippers,
even...
it
can
revoke
the
tariff,
but
even
though
the
shippers
might
be
able
to
prove
that
had
the
antitrust
violation
not
occurred
a
lower
rate
within
the
zone
of
reasonableness
would
have
been
available
to
them.
that
is
what
is
at
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
reparations
are
only
if
an
unreasonable
rate
has
been
charted
that
is
beyond
the
zone
of
reasonableness
or
if
the
tariff
hasn't
been
complied
with.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
keogh
as
it
was
interpreted
and
applied
by
the
court
in
georgia
against
pennsylvania
railroad,
the
broad
rationale
underlying
keogh,
it
would
be
possible
to
read
the
keogh
decision
itself
quite
narrowly
and
say
that
it
has
been
superseded
by
reed-bullwinkle
in
effect,
but
keogh
has
generally
been
applied
in
accordance
with
its
rationale,
which
would
apply
to
any
filed
rate,
whether
approved
by
the
commission
or
not.
of
course,
the
statutory
scheme
has
considerably
changed
considerably
since
keogh.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
as
it
has
been
interpreted
and
applied
in
georgia
against
pennsylvania
railroad,
yes.
or
one
could
say
we
are
asking
that
that
aspect
of
the
georgia
case
be
overruled.
the
georgia
case
did
not
reexamine
that
rationale,
but
applied
it
in
the
scope
that
it
was
stated
by
the
court
in
keogh.
now,
we
have
detailed
in
our
brief,
as
judge
friendly
did
for
the
court
of
appeals,
the
reason
why
the
rationale
of
keogh
has
become
obsolete
in
its
particulars,
and
i
won't
repeat
that
here.
the
main
point
is
that
the
rule
of
keogh
is
incompatible
with
this
court's
modern
jurisprudence
strongly
disfavoring
implied
antitrust
immunities,
limiting
them
to
plain
repugnancy
between
the
two
schemes
and
authorizing
them
not
only
to
the
minimum
extent
necessary
to
make
the
other
federal
statutory
scheme
work,
and
our
position
is
here
not
only
is
the
immunity
unnecessary,
but
compliance
with
the
interstate
commerce
act
as
amended
by
reed-bullwinkle
would
be
fostered
by
the
availability
of
an
antitrust
damage
remedy
as
a
deterrent
to
violations
of
the
procedure
specified
by
reed-bullwinkle
for
collaboration
that
includes
shipper
participation
in
the
rate
bureau
activities
and
a
lack
of
coercion
of
members
of
the
rate
bureau
from
filing
independent
rates.
nor
is
there
any
inconsistency
between
the
established
presumption
against
implied
antitrust
immunity
and
what
has
come
to
be
known
as
the
filed
rate
doctrine,
which
prevents
use
of
the
courts
to
bypass
agency
authority
under
the
statutes
that
agencies
are
charged
to
administer.
the
claim
here
is
not
a
claim
under
the
interstate
commerce
act,
and
the
icc
does
not
administer
the
sherman
act,
nor
is
this
a
case
like
arcla,
the
court's
most
recent
filed
rate
case,
in
which
someone
was
trying
to
circumvent
a
tariff
that
he
himself
had
filed,
and
if
there
is
anything
that
this
court's
carnation
decision
stands
for,
it
is
that
the
ordinary
rule
against
implied
antitrust
immunities
is
compatible
with
the
filed
rate
doctrine.
so,
are
submission
is
that
there
is
no
need
to
allow
persons
to
retain
the
benefits
of
their
antitrust
violation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
my
understanding
is
that
they
were,
but
i
would
have
to
look
back
to
be
sure
about
it.
but
the
case
was
very
comparable,
because
the
challenge
here
is
that
the
prescribed
procedures
under
reed-bullwinkle
were
not
followed
in
filling
the
rates
with
the
icc.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
that
is
a
more
limited
implied
immunity.
there
is
no...
keogh
did
not
construe
any
words
in
a
statute.
it
just
granted
a
more
limited
implied
immunity
from
one
of
the
remedies
and
said
those
damaged
by
the
violations
can't
get
recompense.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
which
to
me
cuts
in
favor
of
our
position,
because
the
respondents
knew
right
along
that
their
conduct
was
unlawful,
and
the
question
is
whether
they
should
retain
the
fruits
of
that
violation
or
those
injured
should
be
recompensed,
and
it
has
been
pointed
out
that
very
few
of
these
rates
are
actually
investigated
and
approved
by
the
icc.
they
are
submitted
and
filed
much
like
putting
a
book
on
a
library
shelf,
and
should
that
make
a
difference
in
who
should
have
the
fruits
of
the
violation?
we
don't
think
so.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
would
decide
certain
facts
and
that
decision,
if
sustainable
in
the
courts
as
a
review
of
any
administrative
decision,
would
be
controlling
in
the
antitrust
suit,
but
it
wouldn't
necessarily
have
decided
all
of
the
issues
in
the
antitrust
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
that
damage
someone,
we
would
take
that
position.
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
that
can
be
proved,
and
if
there
is
a
contention
that
the
lower
rate
would
not
have
been
within
the
zone
of
reasonableness,
or
would
have
been
discriminatory,
those
questions
could
be
referred
to
the
icc
for
an
answer
if
the
icc
had
not
answered
them
in
its--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--what
it
would
have
been,
as
one
could
reasonably
show...
in
many
antitrust
cases
it
is
not
easy
to
prove
the
damages
with
precision.
if
someone
is
excluded
from
business,
he
is
damaged,
but
there
is
necessarily
an
element
of--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
the
damage
might
not
have
been
in
losing
business
to
competitors.
it
might
just
have
been
in
lower
profit
margins.
it
is
a
little
hard
to
say
what
damages
someone
can
prove
until
he
has
a
chance
to
prove
them.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
does
apply
equally.
we
have
taken
a
very
comparable
position
in
the
wheat
rail
case.
the
differences
are
only
technical
differences
in
accommodating
the
two
schemes.
