did
the
maritime
commission
have
ratemaking
authority?
justice
john
paul

mr.
wallace,
could
you
refresh
my
recollection
on
the
carnation
case?
i
though
that
was
just
a
challenge
to
the
procedure,
the
ratemaking
agreements,
which
would
have
been
exempt
if
they
follow
it.
i
didn't
think
there
was
any
problem
of
rates
having
been
approved
or
filed
in
that
case.
were
the
rates
filed
with
the
maritime
commission?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand,
but
of
course
that
was
an
immunity
case,
and
here
the
question
is
whether
the
keogh
takes
away
a
remedy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
conduct
itself
remained
unlawful,
as
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
flexner,
i
understand
your
basic
position,
but
i
don't
see
how...
there
would
be
some
situations
in
which
a
revocation
of
the
existing
rate
would
provide
no
remedy
at
all.
for
example,
supposing
economic
conditions
were
such
that
normally
rates
would
be
declining,
and
the
conspiracy
resulted
in
preserving
the
rate
by
using...
just
declining
to
file
a
change
when
you
normally
would.
you
get
no
remedy
by
revoking
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
i
understand
your
point.
that
is
what
congress
said.
it
is
quite
clear,
however,
that
if
you
lose
in
this
case,
you
are
subjected
to
a
great
deal
of
exposure
that
you
don't
have
now.
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
treble
damages
and
whatever
changes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
i
don't
think
you
can
argue
that
there
are
existing
remedies
that
take
care
of
the
problem.
it
may
be
the
remedies
congress
intended.
but
that
is
quite
different
from
saying
that
they
have
got
adequate
remedies.
justice
john
paul
stevens
sure,
and
there
is
nothing
they
can
do
if
you
preserve
a
rate
against
an
otherwise...
a
decline
that
would
otherwise
normally
follow.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
wonder,
mr.
flexner,
if
your
argument
would
apply
assuming
there
was
a
rate
increase
and
the
commission
took
a
look
at
it
and
then
revoked
it
under
the
ata
case,
so
you
wouldn't
have
a
filed
rate.
then
why
couldn't
they
get
treble
damages
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
they
will
never
do
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
the
district
court
have
power
to
stay
the
proceeding
until
it
found
out
whether
the
icc
might
revoke
the
rates?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
left
out
in
that
list
of
cases
the
southern
motor
carrier
case.
do
you
think
that
is
consistent
with
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--do
you
think
the
reed-bullwinkle
act
was
response
to
keogh
or
a
response
to
the
georgia
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
was
saying
what
his
position
would
be
at
trial,
i
think.
we
understand.
we
assume
your
facts
for
the
purposes--
