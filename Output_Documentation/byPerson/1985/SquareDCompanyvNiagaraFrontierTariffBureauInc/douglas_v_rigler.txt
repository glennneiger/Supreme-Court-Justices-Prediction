mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
issue
presented
in
this
proceeding
is
whether
motor
carriers
who
conspire
in
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws,
who
violate
their
filed
rate
bureau
agreement,
and
who
violate
provisions
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
are
immune
from
damage
suits
brought
under
the
antitrust
laws
by
the
victims
of
their
illegal
conspiracy.
the
petitioners
here
today
are
two
shippers
who
brought
suit
in
a
class
representative
capacity
with
respect
to
the
transport
of
commodities
by
motor
freight
between
points
in
the
eastern
and
central
united
states
and
the
province
of
ontario,
canada.
the
respondents
are
the
niagara
frontier
tariff
bureau,
a
regulated
rate
bureau,
and
five
member
trucking
company
carriers
of
that
bureau.
the
action
closely
parallels
the
united
states
government
action
not
brought
under
the
antitrust
laws
which
was
settled
by
consent
decree.
at
the
district
court
level
the
defendant's
carriers
moved
to
dismiss
the
case,
and
the
district
court
granted
that
motion,
holding
that
maintenance
of
an
action
for
damages
under
the
antitrust
laws
was
barred
by
application
of
this
court's
1922
decision
in
keogh
versus
chicago
and
northwest
railroad.
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
reluctantly
upheld
the
district
court,
holding
that
the
task
of
overruling
keogh
if
it
is
to
be
overruled
is
for
this
court,
but
the
second
circuit
expressed
substantial
doubt
that
any
of
the
basic
rationale
which
necessitated
the
court's
keogh
ruling
in
1922
is
valid
today.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
yes,
i
am,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
yes.
keogh
should
be
overruled
because
the
passage
of
the
reed-bullwinkle
act
and
subsequent
decisions
of
this
court
have
rendered
it
inapplicable
under
the
clear
repugnancy
doctrine
which
necessitated
it
in
the
original
instance.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
do
i
lose?
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
we
are
not
able
to
pursue
our
damage
claims.
we
still
have
an
action
pending
for
injunction,
and
the
second
circuit
did
give
leave
to
amend
in
the
event
there
were
claims
outside
of
the
keogh
doctrine,
but
basically
the
answer
is,
yes,
we
do,
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
are
to
be
accepted
as
correct
for
purposes
of
this
proceeding.
those
allegations
are
that
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
they
had
a
bureau
agreement
on
file
at
the
icc
which
would
have
given
these
carriers
antitrust
exemption,
they
organized
a
secret
committee
of
principles
or
top
management
executives,
and
that
these
principles
met
to
fix
prices,
to
engage
in
anticompetitive
acts,
and
to
coerce
other
carriers
into
withdrawing
or
withholding
independent
rate
filings
which
were
lower
and
would
have
had
the
effect
of
lowering
the
overall
tariff
structures.
now,
the
act
of
coercing
other
carriers
into
withholding
or
withdrawing
their
independent
rate
filings
is
explicitly
and
specifically
forbidden
by
the
interstate
commerce
act.
thus
the
conduct
at
issue
here
violates
the
antitrust
laws
and
the
interstate
commerce
act.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
i
am
not
sure
i
entirely
understand
the
question,
justice
powell,
because
the
part
of
the
damage
claim
relating
to
coercion
would
still
be
valid.
in
other
words,
they
prevented
rates
from
being
filed,
and
yes,
we
would
be
asserting
an
antitrust
clause
of
action
based
on
the
coercion
which
precluded
other
carriers
from
exercising
their
statutory
right
to
file
lower
rates.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
yes,
sir,
i
would.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
we
are
not
attacking
the
ratemaking
process.
we
are
not
attacking
the
antitrust
immunity
which
flows
from
compliance
with
a
regulatory
agency's
rate
authority
granted
by
congress.
in
other
words--
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
--if
the
rates
were
filed
and
became
effective
after
30
days?
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
yes,
we
would,
and
the
reason--
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
--we
would
still
be
here.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
well,
what
they
ignored
was
the
method
of
fixing
rates
which
was
approved
by
the
commission,
and
that
is
what
they
had
statutory
authority
to
do.
the
evil
is
that
instead
of
following
an
exemption
given
to
them
by
congress
in
express
antitrust
immunity,
instead,
they
chose
to
go
around
that
and
to
subvert
the
regulatory
statute.
now,
when
they
did
that
and
filed
rates
in
which
shippers
were
denied
participation,
and
in
which
shippers
didn't
realize
that
there
were
other
carriers
out
there
willing
to
offer
even
lower
rates,
that
constituted
a
violation
which
is
actionable
under
the
antitrust
laws,
and
it
is
no
longer
safeguarded
by
the
express
immunity
which
congress
granted
in
reed-bullwinkle.
neither
is
there
any
necessity
for
the
implied
immunity
which
the
court
granted
so
long
ago
in
keogh,
because
now
the
basic
tension
between
the
interstate
commerce
act,
which
in
1922
permitted
the
icc
to
approve
jointly
proposed
rates
and
the
prohibition
in
the
sherman
act
which
said
companies
should
not
get
together
and
fix
rates
and
fix
prices,
that
basic
original
tension
was
resolved
in
1948
when
congress
eliminated
the
dilemma,
and
this
court
repeatedly
has
held
that
only
a
clear
repugnancy
between
the
antitrust
laws
and
a
regulatory
statute
will
permit
even
implied
immunity,
and
that
implied
immunity
is
to
be
narrowly
construed
so
as
to
make
the
regulatory
plan
work.
once
the
carriers
had
an
opportunity
to
do
that
and
went
outside,
then
their
rates
should
be
subject
to
the
ordinary
application
of
the
antitrust
laws,
and
notwithstanding
that
they
were
filed
with
the
commission,
and
notwithstanding
that
they
became
effective
<thirty>
[=
30]
days
after
approval,
without
any
action
by
the
commission
because
the
commission
simply
no
longer
has
the
resources
to
review
these...
but
even
assuming
that
they
had
done
it,
it
wouldn't
have
been
a
fair
review.
in
their
briefs,
the
respondents
contend
that
when
we
paid
the
filed
rates
with
the
icc,
we
got
to
use
their
words,
exactly
what
we
were
entitled
to.
well,
we
didn't
get
what
we
were
entitled
to
because
the
ratemaking
process
didn't
work
the
way
it
was
supposed
to
because
these
very
respondents
subverted
it.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
as
a
practical
matter,
the
answer
is
no.
let
me
answer
that
question
in
two
ways.
as
a
policy
matter,
we
are
here
under
the
antitrust
laws
because
we
are
entitled
to
those
damages--
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
--yes.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
we
cannot
get
relief
before
the
icc
for
probably
four
reasons.
number
one,
the
lack
of
resources,
which
means
they
can
only
examine
a
handful
of
the
thousands
and
thousands
of
new
tariff
filings
each
year
means
that
their
appetite
for
reviewing
hundreds
of
old
tariff
filings
simply
isn't
going
to
be
there.
secondly,
there
is
a
two-year
statute
of
limitations
with
respect
to
reparations,
and
in
this
case
we
have
a
15-year
conspiracy
which
arose
from
the
concealment
of
the
activities.
we
had
no
idea
that
these
people
mere
coercing--
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
--that
would
be
a
case
of
first
impression.
you
are
asking
whether
the--
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
--concealment
would
apply?
that
has
not
been
decided.
we
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
the
third
question
is,
another
case
of
first
impression,
whether
the
icc
retains
the
authority
to
cancel
expired
tariffs.
remember
that
this
has
been
going
on
for
a
long
time,
and
it
appears
that
the
icc
may
lack
any
authority,
let
alone,
of
course,
the
inclination
to
go
back
and
review--
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
--what
would
be
the
measure
of
damages?
the
sole
measure
of
damages
at
the
icc
would
be
reparations.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
the
measure
of
damages
would
be
the
difference
between
the
rates
which
the
shippers
paid
and
the
rate
levels
which
would
have
prevailed
absent
the
antitrust--
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
--i
am
sorry,
sir?
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
by
expert
testimony
just
the
same
as
in
any
other
antitrust
case.
there
is
nothing
peculiar
about
shipping
goods
by
trucks.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
method
of
computation
or
damages
has
been
used.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
no,
we
would
not.
i
think
that
the
way
things
would
operate
in
the
district
court
is
that
our
expert,
we
would...
obviously,
the
plaintiffs
would
bear
the
burden
of
showing
what
lower
rates
would
have
been.
there
are
various
ways
to
compute
that.
they
would
suggest
that.
the
respondents
would
have
a
chance
to
attack,
and
the
jury
would
make
up
its
mind,
but
that
would
be
no
different
than
the
burden
borne
by
any
other
antitrust
plaintiff.
if
the
rates
were
below
the
zone
of
reasonableness,
i
suppose
the
burden
then
might
shift
to
the
respondents
to
try
to
justify
that,
but
let
me
say
that
the
icc
doesn't
set
the
rates
in
any
event.
they
only
determine
whether
rates
submitted
to
them
are
within
a
zone
of
reasonableness.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
highly
unlikely.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
i
don't
believe
so.
first
of
all,
the
zone
of
reasonableness
is
extremely
broad.
it
is
highly
unlikely
that
we
would
propose
rates
which
would
run
that
risk.
secondly,
if
there
is
a
contention
on
the
respondent's
parts
that
the
rates
we
propose
are
below
that
zone
of
reasonableness,
then
and
only
then,
i
suppose,
the
matter
might
be
referred
to
the
icc,
but
i
believe
that
would
be
a
very
highly
unusual
situation.
i
mean,
when
you
have
a
number
of
other
carriers
already
proposing
lower
rates,
legitimate
carriers
who
are
out
to
make
a
profit,
and
if
we
use
that
as
our
measure
of
damages,
then
there
would
be,
it
seems
to
me,
a
very
strong
suggestion
that
that
was
within
the
zone
of
reasonableness.
in
carnation,
in
the
1966
carnation
case,
which
was,
i
think,
really
on
all
fours
with
this
case
in
many
respects,
there
was
the
possibility
of
reference
back
to
the
fmc,
to
the
maritime
commission,
but
the--
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
--the
maritime
commission
had
rate
approval
authority.
the
icc
may
have
ratemaking
authority,
but
it
doesn't
exercise
it,
i
don't
believe,
very
often,
justice
stevens.
in
other
words,
the
fact
patterns
are
the
same
because
what
you
have
is
the
carriers
proposing
their
rates
and
the
agency
saying,
yes,
these
are
acceptable
rates.
but
in
neither
case
do
you
have
the
agency
saying
you
shall
change
such
and
such
a
rate,
so
that
in
that
sense
the
facts
are
very
much
the
same.
as
a
matter
of
fact...
i
think
this
is
an
important
point...
when
congress
passed
the
reed-bullwinkle
act,
it
alluded
to
the
shipping
act
of
1966
as
a
model,
as
a
precedent
for
the
type
of
express
immunity
it
was
granted,
so
that
if
the
carrier...
if
the
carriers
must
pay
or
stand
vulnerable
to
antitrust
damages
or
illegal
activities
or
unauthorized
activities
under
the
maritime
act,
presumptively
the
same
would
apply
in
this
situation.
it
is
true
there
are
slightly
different
statutory
schemes,
but
the
fact
that
congress
referred
to
it
in
1948,
i
think,
is
determinative.
with
the
court's
consent
at
this
point
i
will
reserve.
if
there
are
more
questions,
i
will
take
them
now.
otherwise,
mr.
wallace
will
speak
for
the
united
states,
and
i
will
save
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
the
court
just
heard
mr.
flexner
tell
it,
that
if
wrongdoers
can
violate
the
antitrust
laws
and
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
get
away
with
it
by
concealing
a
conspiracy
for
a
long
period
of
time,
they
get
to
pocket
the
money,
they
should
be
unjustly
enriched,
and
the
people
who
were
victimized
should
lose
that
money,
and
he
tells
you
that
that
is
what
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
passed
the
reed-bullwinkle
act
which
gave
them
an
express
antitrust
immunity.
that
flies
in
the
face
of
the
implied
immunity
doctrine.
the
implied
immunity
doctrine
is
a
narrow
doctrine.
it
is
a
limited
exception
to
a
broad
national
policy
of
open
price
competition,
and
where
congress
grants
express
immunity,
the
implied
immunity
doctrine
no
longer
applies.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
i
think
that
congress
believed
that
it
had
handled
that
problem
in
the
reed-bullwinkle
act.
let
me
say
that
keogh
didn't
have
to
be
expressly
or
explicitly
by
words
overruled
by
congress
because
the
only
reason
keogh
ever
came
into
existence
was
the
court,
not
congress,
the
court
had
to
grapple
with
the
problem
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
allows
you
to
jointly
submit
rates
for
approval,
and
the
antitrust
laws
forbid
joint
price
fixing,
and
you
have
said
in
gordon
versus
stock
exchange,
the
silver
case,
the
philadelphia
national
bank
case,
the
carnation
case,
the
borden
case,
the
court
could
not
have
been
more
unanimous
and
more
clear
over
the
years
that
that
implied
immunity
disappears
when
congress
takes
express
action.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
the
southern
motor
carrier...
that
is
a
case,
i
believe,
of
justifiable
reliance
in
terms...
i
think
that
that
case
was
only
sited.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
i
think
that
the
reed-bullwinkle
act
was
a
comprehensive
attempt
to
deal
with
it,
and
i
think
we
can
follow
through
on
that
analysis
by
asking
what
happens
if
keogh
is
overruled.
motor
carriers
who
comply
with
the
law
still
get
an
antitrust
exemption
not
only
from
government
prosecution,
but
from
complaints
by
shippers
as
well.
mr.
flexner
was
dead
wrong
when
he
said
that
we
are
arguing
about
approved
activities,
or
activities
which
could
have
been
approved
by
the
icc.
this
comes
up
on
motion
to
dismiss
and
the
allegations
in
that
complaint
are,
they
were--
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
--that
is
right,
and
those
coercive
activities
never
could
have
been
approved.
sending
us
back
to
the
icc
for
a
number
of
reasons
denies
us
all
relief,
and
going
back
to
a
question
justice
o'connor
asked,
carriers
today
don't
have
to
justify
where
they
file
within
that
broad
band
of
reasonable
rates.
they
can
file
at
any
level,
and
it
is
going
to
go
through.
so
we
should
have
the
same
ability
when
they
are
outside
of
their
icc
immunity
to
say,
wait
a
minute,
there
is
some
defect.
the
rate
should
have
been
this
or
that.
you
don't
really
need
the
references
to
the
icc,
and
if
we
are
thrown
back
there
we
will
never
get
it
done.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
to
comprehensively--
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
--i
don't
think
that
they...
i
think
that
what
they
thought
they
were
doing
was
setting
a
game
plan
showing
how
you
could
obtain
regulatory
immunity.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
no,
i
think
i
would
disagree
with
you,
respectfully,
justice
white.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
they
had
two
statutes
that
couldn't
be
read--
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
--i
think
that
congress
dropped
the
ball
and
the
court
had
to
come
up
with
something.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
if
you
look
at
the
express
words
of
the
statute,
they
say
you
may
have
immunity
from
the
antitrust
laws,
but
there
is
a
quid
pro
quo.
you
must
comply
with
the
regulatory
plan.
i
would
agree
with
you.
it
is
not
a
model
of
clarity.
i
think
the
overall
legislative
history
reads
that
congress
did
intend
to
overrule
keogh,
although
that
brings
me
back
to
a
point
which
justice
blackmun
had
raised.
we
are
not
saying
that
there
is
never
any
necessity
for
implied
immunity.
if
you
have
two
