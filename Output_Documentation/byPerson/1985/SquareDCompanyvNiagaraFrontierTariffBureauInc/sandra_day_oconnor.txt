right.
well,
isn't
it
possible
under
your
theory
that
a
court
or
jury
could
afford
damages
on
the
basis
of
a
hypothetical
rate
that
would
have
been
unlawful
under
the
interstate
commerce
act?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
is
certainly
possible,
though,
and
it
could
subject
carriers
to
very
conflicting
standards
with
respect
to
filed
rates,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
sandra

mr.
flexner,
the
solicitor
general
suggests
that
the
question
of
what
the
rate
should
have
been
absent
the
alleged
collusion
or
antitrust
activity
could
be
referred
by
the
court
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
so
that
would
satisfy
your
concern.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
there
is
nothing
inherently
existing
in
the
statutory
framework,
is
there,
to
prevent
a
court
from
referring
the
question
to
the
icc?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
shouldn't
they?
i
mean,
consistent
with
normal
statute
of
limitations
laws,
if
there
has
been
a
concealment,
why
wouldn't
you
expect
that
statute
to
be
told
for
the
commission
itself
and
allow
the
retroactive
setting
aside
of
filed
rates?
