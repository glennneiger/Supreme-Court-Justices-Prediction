justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
zimmerman,
as
i
understand
it,
the
state
does
not
contest
that
part
of
the
magistrate's
order
which
required
transportation
from
a
correctional
facility
to
philadelphia.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and,
the
government
doesn't
challenge
that
part
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
which
required
the
furnishing
of
security
within
the
federal
courthouse?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
what
we
are
talking
about
is
transportation
from
the
state
correctional
center
in
philadelphia
to
the
federal
courthouse
in
philadelphia.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
zimmerman,
when
you
say
you
are
not
arguing
burden,
and
yet
i
take
it
that
the
magistrate
would
not
have
been
free
to
say
that
the
state
has
paid
enough
of
these
costs
so
i
am
going
to
pick
someone
out
of
the
courtroom
here
and
have
him
required
to
pay
the
expenses
from
the
detention
center
in
philadelphia
to
the
federal
courthouse.
if
he
can't
just
pick
someone
from
random,
why
can
he
pick
the
federal
government?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
you
conceded,
i
take
it,
that
you
can't
call
upon
bystanders
to
lessen
the
burden.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
all
the
all
writs
act
gives
you
is
a
remedy
if
there
is
something
you
are
entitled
to
under
some
other
standard.
why
are
you
entitled
to
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
it
is
conceded,
isn't
it,
that
the
magistrate
also
had
power
to
bring...
to
order
the
state
to
bring
the
people
from
the
correction
center
in
western
pennsylvania
to
the
federal
courthouse.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
my
question
wasn't
from
the
correctional
center
to
the
philadelphia.
i
said
from
the
correctional
center
all
the
way
to
the
federal
courthouse.
the
marshal
had
the
authority,
didn't
he,
to
require
the
state
to
do
all
of
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
am
sorry,
the
magistrate,
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
now
my
question
is
do
you
or
do
you
not
admit
that
he
would
have
had
the
authority
to
go
further
and
say
not
just
bring
them
to
philadelphia,
but
bring
them
to
the
federal
courthouse
in
philadelphia?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
that
isn't
necessarily
a
compelling
argument,
because
what
may
be
permissible
as
the
distribution
of
burden
within
the
federal
system
may
not
be
permissible
when
you
go
outside
the
federal
system
and
ask
the
state
to
produce
some--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
levy,
what
if
someone
commenced
a
lawsuit
in
the
federal
court
in
the
eastern
district
of
philadelphia
and
said
we
are
proceeding
ifp
and
made
the
necessary
affidavits
and
then
decides
that
he
wants
to
subpoena
some
witnesses.
now,
do
the
witness
that
an
ifp
plaintiff
subpoenas
get
witness
fees
and
mileage
the
way
the
other
witnesses
do?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
should
they
have
to
come
if
they
don't
get
the
statutory
witness
and
mileage
fees
if
there
is
no
exception
for
ifp
plaintiff?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
the
in
forma
pauperis
plaintiff
can't
compel
witnesses
outside
of
prisons
to
come
without
paying
mileage
and
witness
fees.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
it
is
a
custodial
situation
and
not
just
the
payment
of
witness
fees
and
mileage?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
there
must
be
more
limits
than
i
get
the
impression
you
say
there
are.
supposing
they
are
building
a
new
building
for
the
department
of
justice
and
the
attorney
general
says
we
are
behind
schedule
on
the
building,
you
ten
marshals
go
down
and
start
digging
that
trench.
is
that
a
permissible
exercise
of
discretion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
the
marshal
willing
to
do
this
latter
thing,
transport
prisoners
between
states
for
state
proceedings,
but
not
to
do
what
the
magistrate
in
this
case
said
he
should
do?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
a
district
judge
or
a
magistrate
could
under
28
u.s.c.
569.
it
can
order
the
marshals
to
attend
a
session
of
the
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and,
it
could
order
the
marshal
to
execute
any
lawful
writs,
process
of
papers,
issued
out
of
the
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
now
here
the
marshal
could
have
issued
the
subpoena
ad
testificandum
and
directed
the
marshal
to
deliver
to
the
custodian
of
the
state
prison,
could
he
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
magistrate
could
have
issued
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
ad
testificandum
to
produce
these
witnesses
from
the
western
state
penitentiary
and
directed
the
marshal
to
serve
that
writ
on
the
custodian.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
