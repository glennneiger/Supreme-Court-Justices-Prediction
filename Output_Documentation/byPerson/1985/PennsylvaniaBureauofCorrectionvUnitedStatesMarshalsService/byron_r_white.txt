justice
byron
r.
white
general,
i
don't
suppose
your
submission
would
be
limited
to
that
fortuitous
circumstance.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
think
any
time
in
the
1983
action
the
federal
marshals
should
be
required
to
bring
the
plaintiff,
if
he
is
a
prisoner,
and
witnesses
from
the
prison,
furnish
any
of
that
transportation.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it
is
a
question
of
authority,
why,
if
they
have
authority
or
if
they
are
obligated
to
do
this
under
the
law,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
what
the
burden
is,
would
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
general,
pursuing
justice
blackmun's
question
another
step,
if
this
had
been
in
the
state
court
and
the
plaintiff
was
not
an
indigent...
he
was
in
prison,
but
he
wanted
witnesses
from
the
state
prison,
wouldn't
you
make
him
pay
the
witness
fees
and
wouldn't
you
make
him
pay
the
transportation?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
the
plaintiff
is
not
an
indigent?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
said--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and,
in
this
case
then,
if
this
person
were
not
an
indigent,
wouldn't
he
have
to
pay?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
a
writ
issued
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
attorney
general--
--why
wasn't
there
just
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
had
just
been
served
on
the
custodian?
what
would
the
writ
have
said?
bring
him,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
bring
him
to
the
courthouse.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
that
is
all
that
would
have
been
served
on
the
custodian?
what
would
have
happened?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
there
is
this
provision
for
getting
witnesses
to
the
courthouse,
but
the
magistrate
didn't
use
that,
he
used
an
order.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
levy,
is
it
consistent...
would
it
be
consistent
with
your
argument
to
say
that
the
marshal
could
agree
to
have
done
what
he
was
ordered
to
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
would
he
have
the
authority
to
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
my
question
is
where
would
they
get
the
authority
to
do
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean
the
marshals
can
just
issue
a
writ
on
the
treasury
of
the
united
states
without
authority
to
do
so?
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
or
not
there
is
any
express
authority
for
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
really
are
just
relying
on
the
separation
argument
to
a
great
extent.
if,
without
express
authority,
the
attorney
general
could
spend
this
money
if
he
wanted
to,
you
are
really
just
saying,
well,
that
may
be
so,
but
a
judge
can't
order
him
to
do
it
over
his
objection?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
may
be,
but
that
is
just
about
where
you
stand,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
writs
were
issued
in
this
case,
weren't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
who
served
them
on
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
the
marshal
to
serve
them
would
have
to
go
to
these
penitentiaries.
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
there
would
be
authority,
inherent
authority,
you
say,
for
the
marshals
service
to
undertake
that
obligation
within
its
discretion.
if
it
wanted
to,
it
could
do
so.
