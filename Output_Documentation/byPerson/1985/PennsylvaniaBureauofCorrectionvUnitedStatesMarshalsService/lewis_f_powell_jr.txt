justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
attorney
general,
refresh
my
recollection.
how
far
was
the
transportation
in
terms
of
miles?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and,
you
mentioned
burden.
i
realize
that
you
can
make
all
sorts
of
suppositious
cases,
but
suppose
it
were
50
miles.
would
the
rule
still
be
the
same?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and,
that
would
apply
to
the
50
miles?
