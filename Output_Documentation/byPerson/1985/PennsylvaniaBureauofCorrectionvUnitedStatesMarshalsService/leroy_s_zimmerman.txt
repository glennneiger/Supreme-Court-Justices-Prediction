mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
presented
by
this
appeal
is
whether
a
district
court
has
the
authority
to
direct
the
united
states
marshals
service
to
share
responsibility
with
state
officials
for
the
production
of
state
inmates
to
appear
in
federal
district
court
at
a
trial
of
a
civil
action.
this
question
arose
in
the
course
of
a
civil
rights
action
brought
by
a
state
prisoner
against
philadelphia
county
officials
for
events
allegedly
occurring
while
he
was
in
the
custody
of
county
prison
officials.
the
magistrate
ordered
the
state
custodians
to
produce
the
plaintiff
and
two
witnesses.
plaintiff
was
incarcerated
220
miles
from
the
federal
courthouse.
one
witness
218
miles
away
and
another
witness
143
miles
away.
recognizing
the
burden
that
is
placed
on
the
state
custodians,
the
magistrate
ordered
that
state
custodians
transport
the
inmates
to
the
philadelphia
house
of
detention,
there
to
transfer
custody
to
the
united
states
marshals,
who
would
transport
the
prisoners
from
the
house
of
detention
to
the
federal
courthouse
and
maintain
custody
of
them
while
they
were
inside
the
courthouse.
well,
the
magistrate's
order
transferring
custody
from
state
to
federal
officers
and
the
apportion
of
transportation
responsibilities
were
based
in
part
on
his
knowledge
that
the
u.s.
marshal
regularly
transported
federal
prisoners
between
the
philadelphia
house
of
detention
and
the
federal
courthouse.
this
arrangement
permitted
state
custodians
to
avoid
the
deployment
of
guards
from
their
primary
responsibility,
that
of
maintaining
prison
security,
to
transferring
prisoners.
the
u.s.
marshals
service
intervened
to
oppose
the
orders,
arguing
that
no
authority
exists
to
support
such
orders.
in
rejecting
the
marshals'
contentions,
the
magistrate
recognized
that
the
explosion
of
federal
civil
rights
litigation
by
state
prisoners
has
strained
available
resources.
consequently,
in
fashioning
a
procedure,
the
magistrate
stressed
that
his
order
placed
considerable
burden
on
state
officials,
but
the
marshal
really
would
have
very
little
burden,
if
any
at
all.
the
court
of
appeals
in
a
split
decision
did
not
dispute
the
magistrate's
factual
and
pragmatic
conclusions,
rather,
judge
gibbons,
writing
for
the
court,
concluded
that
no
statutory
authority,
including
the
all
writs
act,
supported
the
magistrate's
order,
apportioning
the
transportation
responsibility
between
state
officials
and
the
united
states
marshals.
the
court
held
that
the
marshal
is
obligated
to
maintain
custody
over
the
prisoners
while
they
are
in
the
courthouse.
in
fact,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
if
security
concerns
justify
it,
the
marshal
could
be
ordered
to
take
custody
of
state
prisoners
outside
the
courthouse.
now,
it
is
our
position--
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
--that
is
correct,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
that
is
correct,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
yes.
it
is
our
position
that
the
all
writs
act--
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
no.
the
house
of
detention
in
philadelphia,
operated
by
the
county
of
philadelphia,
is
a
designated
repository
by
the
federal
marshals
to
house
federal
prisoners.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
this
ruling...
the
magistrate,
in
fashioning
this
ruling,
justice
marshall,
said
that
because
they
regularly...
in
considering
this,
because
the
marshals
regularly
went
back
and
forth,
that
it
was
not
a
burden
on
them
to
transport
state
prisoners
to
federal
court
in
civil
rights
actions.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
no,
justice
white.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
justice
white,
so
long
as
it
is
not
an
inordinate
burden
on
the
federal
marshals.
i
think
that
that
is
something...
i
think
the
source
of
the
powers
in
the
all
writs
act,
but
i
think
that
beyond
that
then
there
is
a
matter
of
discretion,
assuming
that
point
of
law
where
the
magistrate
can
take
into
account
the
respective
burdens--
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
--no.
it
is
our
position
that
the
all
writs
act--
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
--five
miles
from
the
house
of
detention
in
philadelphia
to
the
federal
courthouse.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
well,
justice
powell,
i
don't
think
that
the
question
of
burden
is
in
this
particular
case.
there
is
no
record
in
this
case
to
determine
whether
it
were
not
nor
is
there
a
challenge
to
the
magistrate's
exercise
of
discretion
by
the
marshals.
the
sole
source,
the
focus
of
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
all
writs
act
provides
the
authority,
the
power
in
the
court,
to
fashion
such
a
writ
as
it
did
in
this
case.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
yes,
sir.
it
is
our
position
that--
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
--justice
o'connor,
i
don't
think
that
this
is
a
question
solely
of
money.
it
is
our
position
that
this
is
a
question
of
allocation
of
manpower
and
getting
prisoners
from
a
place
where
they
are
incarcerated
to
a
place
where
their
rights
would
be
vindicated.
obviously,
money
is
involved,
but
it
is
a
question
of
manpower
and
the
allocation
of
manpower
from
maintaining
the
operation
of
prisons
in
a
secure
fashion.
that
is
part
of
the
question
of
this
burden.
it
does
involve
money.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
well,
i
believe--
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
--in
this
particular
case...
it
is
not
our
argument
that
it
is
necessary,
but
i
do
believe
that
the
act...
of
course,
the
act
says,
"appropriate
in
aid
of
the
respective
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
"
and,
i
suggest
that
in
this
case,
as
well
as
being
agreeable
to
the
usage
and
the
principle
of
law...
in
this
case,
the
all
writs
act
was
designed
to
give
the
courts
that
flexibility
and
i
believe
that
when
there
is
a
determination
made
and
there
is
a
burden,
anything
that
lessens
that
burden,
that
burden
to
produce
a
prisoner,
and
obviously
there
has
to
be--
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
--as
we
argue,
if
the
all
writs
act
is
the
source
of
the
court's
power,
and
i
believe
that
it
is
here,
then,
of
course,
there
will
be
a
question
in
each
of
the
cases,
a
matter
of
discretion
of
the
magistrate
to
exercise
discretion,
whether
or
not
he
has
acted
correctly
in
looking
at
the
burden
of
producing
a
witness.
in
civil
rights
cases,
it
is
necessary
frequently
for
the
court
to
make
a
determination
on
whether
or
not
to
produce
the
prisoner
or
witness
in
the
court.
now,
in
examining
and
making
that
decision,
there
are
burdens
that
are
going
to
be
placed
if
the
court
decides
the
prisoner
should
be
there
or
the
witnesses
ought
to
be
there
to
better
vindicate
the
rights,
to
have
a
more
clearly
and
informed
court.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
no,
it
does
not
take
that
position,
justice
o'connor.
the
all
writs
act
is
designed
to
give
the
court
the
flexibility
you
say
is
necessary
to
free
the
courts
from
the
constraints
of
historic
practice
where
new
solutions
are
essential
to
solve
new
problems.
and,
this
court
has
reaffirmed
that
flexibility,
the
all
writs
act,
recognizing
it
as
a
judicial
arsenal
from
which
the
courts
can
develop
new
tools
as
the
need
arises.
now,
the
act
is
worded
broadly.
as
i
said
a
moment
again,
a
new
writ
only
satisfy
two
requirements,
that
it
be
necessary
or
appropriate
in
aid
of
the
court's
jurisdiction,
and
agreeable
to
the
usages
and
the
principles
of
law.
now,
that
first
requirement,
we
feel
that
there
is
no
question
that
the
underlying
civil
rights
action
was
within
the
district
court's
jurisdiction
and
i
submit
the
magistrate's
orders
were
appropriate
in
aide
of
that
court's
jurisdiction.
the
explosion
of
civil
rights
litigation,
especially
by
prisoners,
has
increased
the
requirement
for
the
production
of
prisoners
in
court
and
the
corresponding
burden
on
the
custodians
who
must
produce
those
prisoners.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
yes,
justice.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
well,
the
state
court--
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
--that
is
correct.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
it
would
be.
specifically,
in
civil
rights
cases,
the
court
must
often
decide
whether
to
require...
as
i
indicated,
whether
to
require
the
production
of
these
prisoner
witnesses
in
court.
in
making
that
decision,
the
court
must
weigh
the
relevance
or
the
importance
of
probable
testimony
against
the
burden
of
producing
the
prisoner
witnesses.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
no,
justice
white,
he
would
not
be
required...
if
the
witnesses
were
in
prison,
he
would
not
be
required
to
pay
those.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
well,
if
he
is
an
indigent--
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
--he
would
not
be
required
to
pay.
if
he
were
not
indigent,
yes,
justice
white,
he
would
be
required
to
pay
the
cost.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
in
the
case
of
a
state
prisoner
here
in
this
case?
he
would
eventually,
depending
on
the
outcome
of
litigation,
that
may
be
taxed
against
him,
yes.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
the
arrangement
is
entered
into
between
the
marshals
service
and
the
philadelphia
county
house
of
detention.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
the
arrangement
there
is
between
philadelphia
and
the
u.s.
marshals
in
this
case.
ordinarily,
state
prisoners
would
not
be
transported
from
the
place
of
incarceration
in
philadelphia
to
the
house
of
detention.
they
would
go
directly
to
the
federal
courthouse.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
a
state
prisoner
would
be
returned
to
the
place
in
philadelphia
called
greaterford
which
is
the
state
penitentiary
there.
they
would
not
go
back
to
the
house
of
detention
ordinarily,
not
as
state
prisoners.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
that
is
correct.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
in
this
particular
case,
the
expenses
would
be
worked
out
in
accordance
with
a
voluntary
agreement
between
the
marshals
service
and
the
county
of
philadelphia.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
well,
i
don't
know
the
correct
terms...
i
don't
know
the
exact
terms
of
that
agreement
in
this
particular
case,
justice
marshall.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
there
is
no
record
in
this
case,
but
the
magistrate
found
in
making
his
order
that
the
bus...
the
marshals
traveled
regularly
to
and
from
the
house
of
detention
to
the
federal
courthouse.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
there
is
no
showing
of
any
kind
because
there
is
no
record.
and,
in
this
case,
we
are
not
arguing
burden.
i
don't
think
burden
is
involved
here.
it
is
strictly
a
power,
a
power
question
of
the
court
and
the
authority
of
the
magistrate
under
the
all
writs
act.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
well,
i
am
not
certain
about
who
buys
his
lunch
in
the
federal
courthouse,
but
from
my
experience
as
attorney
general
as
a
prosecutor
i
believe
that
his
lunch
would
be
provided
by
the
united
states
marshals
because
he
is
in
their
custody
inside
the
courthouse
in
this
case.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
i
believe
that
in
this
particular
case
anything
that
will
lessen
that
burden
of
proceeding--
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
--i
don't
take
the
position
in
this
case
that
section
1651,
the
all
writs
act,
is
unlimited.
there
are
limitations.
the
limitations
are
that
certainly
the
court
cannot
order
somebody
to
do
something
that
is
not
in
the
course
of
their
duties.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
i
believe
the
court
was
entitled
to
do
what
it
did
here
in
order
to
get
these
witnesses
from
where
they
are
incarcerated
to
a
federal
court
to
vindicate
their
rights.
that
is
a
very
important
aspect
of
this.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
that
is
correct
and
that
is
what
he
did
in
this
case.
and,
most
of
the
burden
in
this
particular
case
was
on
the
state
custodian.
there
was
very
little--
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
--the
magistrate.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
the
magistrate
had
the
authority
and,
in
fact,
did
in
this
case
say
bring
the
prisoners
from
wherever
they
are
incarcerated
throughout
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
in
the
various
institutions
to
philadelphia.
now,
in
order
to
lessen--
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
--yes,
he
would
have,
but
i
argue
in
this
case
he
considered
the
burden
and
an
attempt
to
lessen
the
burden
on
the
state
custodian
somewhat.
in
this
case
minimally
i
concede,
but
we
are
not
focusing
on
that
in
this
case.
i
believe
that
the
principle
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
magistrate...
the
problem
in
this
case
is
whether
the
magistrate
had
the
authority
to
do
what
he
did
and
i
believe
the
all
writs
act,
of
course,
gives
him
that
authority
because
of
the
need,
to
vary
writs,
to
vary
orders.
the
question
of
burden
in
producing
persons
makes...
that
has
to
be
examined
and
wherever
it
makes
it
more
likely
that
the
court
will
be
able
to
hear
and
to
consider
all
of
the
evidence
relevant
to
the
merits
of
a
claim,
clearly
that
aids
the
court
in
an
informed
exercise
of
its
jurisdiction.
now,
the
marshals
argue
that
these
orders
are
neither
appropriate
or
necessary
because
there
already
exists
the
general
habeas
corpus
statute
which
they
say
places
the
full
burden
on
the
custodian
to
produce
the
prisoners
in
the
federal
courthouse.
this
argument,
we
believe,
ignores
the
point
that
some
cases
may
call
for
modification
of
traditional
procedure.
and,
where
modification
is
determined
to
be
necessary
or
appropriate
in
aid
of
the
court's
jurisdiction,
the
power
to
modify
is
found
not
in
the
habeas
corpus
statute,
but
in
the
all
writs
act.
thus,
the
habeas
corpus
statute
is
really
not
the
end
for
purposes
of
analysis
as
the
marshals
argue,
but
really
the
beginning.
similar
considerations,
i
submit,
support
the
conclusion
that
the
order
under
review
is
as
required
by
the
all
writs
act
agreeable
to
the
usages
and
principles
of
law.
certainly,
transfer
of
custody
violates
no
positive
congressional
command
nor
does
it
violate
any
common
law
rule,
rather
the
order
modifies
traditional
procedure
to
respond
to
modern
developments
in
our
ever-expanding
jurisprudence.
the
essential
principal
underlying
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
ad
testificandum
is
affording
the
court
an
orderly
and
an
efficient
means
of
procedure
for
securing
the
testimony
of
prisoner
witnesses.
this
principle
hardly
is
subverted
by
a
modification
of
the
writ
directing
the
transfer
of
a
prisoner
from
the
custodian
to
a
substitute
custodian.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
an
order
was
issued
in
this
case,
justice
white,
by
the
magistrate,
by
magistrate
hall.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
the
magistrate
did
not
label
the
writ.
the
magistrate
relied
on
the
habeas
corpus
statute
in
this
case.
it
is
our
position,
and
we
argued
this
in
the
circuit
court,
and
the
circuit
court
held
against
us,
that
the
authority
and
the
power
to
do
what
was
done
here
was
in
the
all
writs
act;
that
it
was
necessary
to
go
to
that
act
to
find
the
variation
and
the
flexibility
that
the
court
has
said
was
in
that
act
to
do
what
was
done,
a
transfer
of
custody.
the
traditional
habeas
corpus
act
is
concerned
with
getting
inside
the
prison
walls
of
the
custodian
and
getting
the
prisoner
to
the
gate.
there
is
no
question
about
that,
the
habeas
corpus
writ
generally.
but,
from
that
point,
getting
the
prisoners
from
the
gate
of
the
jail
to
the
courthouse,
today
there
are
many--
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
--yes,
sir.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
yes,
it
would
have.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
then
the
custodian
would
have
been
required
to
bring
him
to
the
courthouse.
but,
my
point
is--
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
--in
the
calculus
of
the
magistrate,
and
without
a
record
i
suggest
it
is
impossible
to
be
precise,
but
in
the
calculus
of
the
magistrate's
order,
in
examining
that
order,
you
will
see
that
he
took
into
account
the
principles
and
the
concerns
that
i
say
are
in
the
all
writs
act
to
be
used
by
the
court.
in
any
case,
whatever
statutes
exist
to
govern
and
devine
the
role
of
the
marshal
are
not
inconsistent
with
the
role
of
the
marshal,
are
not
inconsistent
with
the
duties
that
are
imposed
by
the
order
here.
marshals
are
assigned
regularly
to
go
to
court.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
assuming
that
the
all
writs
act
provides
the
authorities,
i
urge
that
it
does,
then
it
would
have
been
up
to
the
magistrate
to
determine.
we
are
not
asking
in
this
case
that
there
be--
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
--i
believe
that
if
the
magistrate
directed
and
knew
that
the
marshal
was
going
to
chicago
once
a
week
regularly,
it
would
not
have
been
improper
for
the
magistrate
to
have
fashioned
an
order
to
say,
marshal,
bring
the
prisoner
from
california
to
chicago
and
the
state
will
be
required
to--
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
--well,
i
think--
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
--i
don't
think
that
the
question--
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
--i
think
that
either
one
could
be
ordered
to
pay
completely.
it
would
be
preferable
to
have
a
sharing
of
transportation
responsibilities.
decisions
in
other
courts
of
appeals
demonstrate
that
this
procedure
apportioning
these
responsibilities
for
transportation
has
been
employed...
have
been
employed
in
many
districts
throughout
this
country.
finally,
i
urge
the
court
in
this
case
to
preserve
the
reservoir
of
judicial
power
that
is
found
in
the
all
writs
act,
which
was
built
by
the
congress
to
provide
the
courts
with
the
necessary
flexibility
to
craft
new
orders
and
new
writs
that
are
responsive
to
the
varied
and
practical
challenges
arising
out
of
an
ever-expanding
jurisprudence.
thank
you.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
a
very,
very
brief
rebuttal,
one
point.
the
government
has
argued
finite
resources.
certainly
there
are
finite
resources
on
both
sides,
the
state
and
the
marshals
service
in
this
particular
case,
and
there
will
always
be
burden
to
be
considered
here.
but,
it
is
our
position
that
the
magistrate
should
have
the
discretion
to
consider
the
burden
in
order
to
try
in
more
cases
to
have
more
prisoners,
more
witnesses
in
the
court
in
these
civil
rights
cases
in
order
to
make
a
more
enlightened
determination.
and,
frequently,
in
the
calculus
that
is
used
by
the
court
to
determine
whether
to
issue
the
writ,
that
is
a
factor.
i
respectfully
ask
this
court
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
to
affirm
the
order
of
the
magistrate
in
this
case.
thank
you.
