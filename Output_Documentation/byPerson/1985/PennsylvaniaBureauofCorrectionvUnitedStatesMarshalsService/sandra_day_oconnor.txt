justice
sandra
day
o'connor
general
zimmerman,
suppose
that
you
are
somehow
correct
that
the
all
writs
act
could
encompass
such
a
power
on
the
part
of
the
federal
court
to
order
this
transportation,
what
requirements
would
you
then
think
a
judge
or
magistrate
would
have
to
find
in
order
to
justify
such
an
order?
is
it
enough
that
the
magistrate
or
judge
determine
that
there
should
be
cost
shifting
from
the
state
to
the
federal
government?
is
that
alone
enough
to
justify
an
order
like
this
under
the
all
writs
act
if
you
are
correct?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
requirements
do
you
think
would
have
to
be
met
under
the
all
writs
act
if
your
position
about
it
is
valid--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--to
justify
such
an
order?
i
think
the
language
of
the
act
incorporates
words
such
as
necessary
and
appropriate.
what
would
make
it
necessary
and
appropriate?
what
is
there
in
this
case
other
than
a
cost
shifting
in
effect?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
is
a
burden
on
both
the
federal
and
state
agencies
to
have
to
do
this.
there
is
always
a
burden
and
there
is
always
a
cost.
what
is
to
guide
a
court
or
magistrate
in
making
such
a
determination?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
this
case,
does
the
state
take
the
position
that
it
would
not
have
obeyed
an
ad
testificandum
order
to
have
the
prisoner
transported?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
however,
mr.
levy,
in
the
circumstances
proposed,
for
example,
by
justice
stevens,
conceivably
it
is
arguable
under
some
extreme
circumstances
that
might
be
necessary
and
appropriate.
