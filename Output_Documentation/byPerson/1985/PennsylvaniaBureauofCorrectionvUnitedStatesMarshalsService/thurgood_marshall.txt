do
you
have
a
federal
house
of
detention
in
philadelphia?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
have
a
federal
house
of...
do
you
have
any
place
where
federal
prisoners
are
kept
in
philadelphia?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
what
this
ruling
says
is
that
they
can
pick
up
their
own
prisoners
and
transfer
them,
but
they
don't
have
to
pick
up
these
from
the
exact
same
place?
justice
thurgood
marshall
okay.
mr.
attorney
general,
while
this
state
prisoner
is
in
philadelphia,
who
pays
for
his
expenses
there,
the
federal
government?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
talking
about
in
a
case
like
this,
this
prisoner
here.
who
would
pay
for
his
living
expenses
in
philadelphia?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
the
case
lasted
more
than
one
day.
who
would
pay
the
expenses?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
the
state
would
pay
his
expenses?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
in
this
case,
who
would
pay
his
expenses?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
trying
to
find
out
what
is
that
voluntary
agreement.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
talk
about
the
additional...
there
are
no
additional
expenses
in
this
case.
is
it
admitted
that
this
bus
goes
every
day?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and,
is
there
any
showing
that
this
precedent
would
cause
additional
expense?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
attorney
general
assuming
that
the
week
before
this
occurred
the
prisoner
had
been
transferred
to
california.
who
would
produce
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
who
would
you
suggest
in
conformity
with
your
theory
would
be
responsible
for
transporting
him
back
to
philadelphia?
justice
thurgood
marshall
let's
make
one
little
minor
change,
hawaii.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
know
of
any
marshal
that
goes
from
philadelphia
to
hawaii
regularly.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don't
really
mean
just
because
he
goes
there.
it
is
a
very
simple
question.
would
california,
philadelphia,
or
the
federal
government
pay
for
the
transportation
of
this
hypothetical
prisoner?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
levy,
getting
it
closer
to
this
case,
a
judge
tells
the
marshal,
i
have
a
witness
who
is
in
the
house
of
detention
in
philadelphia
that
i
need
for
trial
this
afternoon.
i
have
discovered
that
you
have
a
bus
that
is
going
to
bring
in
federal
prisoners
and
other
people
from
the
exact
same
place
and
that
you
have
half
a
dozen
seats
vacant
on
there,
would
you
mind
putting
him
in
one
of
those
seats
and
bring
him
to
the
courthouse.
what
is
wrong
with
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and,
that
is
the
difference
between
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
the
whole
question
is
he
was
ordered
and
not
asked?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
the
difference?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
the
difference?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
what
you
are
complaining
about?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
he
had
asked
it
would
have
been
all
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
city
the
size
of
philadelphia.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
city
the
size
of
philadelphia.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
levy,
was
there
any
effort
or
is
there
any
effort
now
to
work
this
out
amicably
between
the
state,
the
federal
government,
the
judges,
and
the
marshals?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
see
why
we
have
this
tension
between
the
magistrate
and
a
marshal.
they
are
both
working
for
the
same
boss.
justice
thurgood
marshall
were
any
efforts
made
to
work
this
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
they
sit
down?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
believe,
but
you
don't
know?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
seems
to
be
it
would
have
been
much
easier
than
bothering
us
with
it.
