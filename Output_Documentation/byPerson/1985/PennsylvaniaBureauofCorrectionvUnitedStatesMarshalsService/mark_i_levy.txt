mr.
mark
i.
levy
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
state's
argument
here
is,
in
essence,
that
the
magistrate's
order
is
reasonable.
the
trial
courts
have
broad
authority
to
impose
reasonable
obligations
on
the
united
states
marshals
service
and
that
our
objection
to
the
order
are,
as
in
the
words
of
the
state's
reply
brief,
merely
dry
formalism.
all
of
that
is
far
from
correct.
the
united
states
marshals
service
is
an
arm
of
the
executive
branch
of
the
federal
government.
marshals
are
appointed
by
the
president,
is
part
of
the
department
of
justice,
and
under
the
supervision
of
the
attorney
general,
and
is
funded
through
department
of
justice
appropriations.
in
fact,
this
court
in
its
opinion
in
the
naggle
case
reported
in
135
u.s.,
specifically
recognized
that
the
marshals
service
is
within
the
executive
branch.
thus,
contrary
to
the
premise
of
the
state's
argument,
the
marshals
service
is
not
the
hand-maiden
or
the
administrative
staff
of
the
courts
subject
to
whatever
duties
judges,
in
their
discretion,
may
devise.
now,
of
course,
the
marshals
service
and
the
courts
have
developed
a
sound
and
cooperative
working
relation
that
well
serves
the
effective
administration
of
justice.
the
marshal
is
by
law
subject
to
the
control
of
federal
judges
in
many
respects.
in
addition,
the
marshal
often
exercises
his
discretion
as
an
executive
official
and
agrees
to
do
things
that
legally
could
not
be
required.
thus,
disputes
of
the
kind
involved
in
this
case
are
fortunately
very
rare.
but,
that
cooperative
arrangement
does
not
negate
the
principle
that
there
must
be
a
source
of
statutory
authorization
before
a
court
can
require
the
marshal,
as
part
of
the
executive
branch
of
the
federal
government,
to
take
a
particular
action
and
expend
its
funds
in
a
particular
way.
the
marshal
has
myriad
responsibilities
and
only
limited
resources
with
which
to
carry
them
out.
among
its
principal
responsibilities
are
the
security
of
the
courthouse,
custody
over
and
transportation
of
federal
prisoners
needed
in
federal
court,
execution
of
arrest
warrants,
and
seizure
of
forfeited
property,
and
implementation
of
the
witness
protection
program.
to
perform
these
duties,
there
are
fewer
than
1,000
deputy
marshals
nationwide,
while
there
are
500
active
federal
district
judges
and
250
full-time
magistrates
in
500
federal
court
facilities
around
the
country.
the
allocation
among
those
various
duties
of
the
finite
resources
appropriated
to
the
marshal
is
at
the
heart
of
the
executive
branch's
function.
in
the
aggregate,
orders
of
the
type
entered
by
the
magistrate
here
will
impose
a
substantial
burden
on
the
marshals
service
and
interfere
with
its
discharge
of
its
statutorily
assigned
responsibilities.
in
addition,
a
trial
court
in
any
given
case,
is
in
no
position
to
assess
these
considerations
and
decide
how
the
marshals'
resources
are
to
be
deployed
overall.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
sure.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
first,
in
those
circumstances
it
is
exceedingly
likely
that
the
marshal
would
agree
to
go
out
and
do
that.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
the
answer
is
he
might,
but
that
is
a
much
different
situation
from
what
we
have
here.
in
that
situation
the
marshal
would
not
be
required
in
the
first
instance
to
bear
the
transportation
or
production
burden,
rather
the
court
would
have
entered
the
ad
testificandum
writ
to
the
custodian
and
when
the
custodian
was
unable
or
in
this
instance
unwilling
to
comply,
the
court,
in
effect,
would
enter
a
second
order,
a
compliance
order,
enforcement
or
sanction
order.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
for
example,
if
the
state
custodian
simply
refused
to
comply
with
an
order
that
was
within
his
capability--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--well,
the
question
would
be
whether...
as
part
of
enforcing
an
order
that
directive
to
the
marshal
would
be
appropriate.
there
are
questions
whether
it
would,
but
that
is
a
much
different
sort
of
issue
than
is
presented
here,
where
the
marshal
is
required
in
the
first
instance
to
produce
that--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--i
am
doubtful
that
there
would
be.
i
am
not
taking
a
categorical
position
on
it.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
not
necessarily.
as
i
say
the
jurisdictional
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
magistrate
has
the
authority,
the
judicial
power
to
require
the
marshal
in
the
first
instance
to
step
into
the
state's
shoes
and
become
the
principle
respondent
for
producing
the
body
of
the
prisoner.
that
is
not
the
situation--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--but,
the
marshal
would
not
be
acting
in
lieu
of
or
as
the
surrogate
custodian
in
that
case.
the
marshal
would
be
acting
as
a
law
enforcement
official
enforcing
a
federal
court
order
that
the
state
was
unable
to
comply
with.
that
enforcement
responsibility
of
the
marshal
simply
presents
a
different
question
than
the
one
in
this
case.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
nothing
may
be
wrong
with
it
and
the
marshal
in
most
instances,
i
assume,
would
be
agreeable
to
complying
in
his
discretion.
the
question
is
whether
or
not--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--yes.
in
this
case,
the
marshal
was
required,
not
asked
or
invited.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
the
question
here
is
one
of
judicial--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--the
question
here
is
one
of
judicial
power.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
yes,
but
that
has
nothing--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--we
are
complaining
about--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--if
you
are
asking
if
the
marshal
chose
to
do
it
because
it
was
not
inconsistent
or
a
burden
on
his
other
responsibilities.
in
this
case,
as
the
attorney
general
of
pennsylvania
stated,
there
is
no
record
and
the
magistrate
did
not
make
any
specific
findings
about
either
the
burden
on
the
state
in
this
case.
all
he
said
generally
was
that
there
was
a
burden
on
the
state
in
general
or
the
burden
on
the
marshal
in
this
case.
in
contrast
to
the
hypothetical,
justice
marshall,
i
am
advised,
just
as
an
illustration,
that
the
marshal
typically
brings
between
six
and
twelve
prisoners
from
the
philadelphia
detention
center
to
the
federal
courthouse
on
an
average
day.
in
this
case,
the
prisoner
originally
sought
writs
for
nine
state
prisoners.
the
magistrate
initially
cut
him
back
to
five.
those
numbers
are
a
substantial
portion
of
the
prisoners
that
the
federal
government
has
need
to
bring
in
for
its
own
purposes.
it
might
well
require
additional
vehicles.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i'm
sorry?
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that
is
correct.
it
might
require
additional
vehicles,
it
might
require
extra
guards.
there
are
any
number
of
ways
in
which
this
could
impose
a
very
serious
burden
on
the
marshal
and
that
would
interfere
with
the
marshal's
execution
of
its
other
obligations.
now,
congress
could
certainly
decide
as
a
policy
matter
that
the
united
states
marshals
service
should
transport
these
prisoners
and
congress
could
make
available
the
necessary
funds
to
do
so,
but
we
don't
have
that
here.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
incidents
with
courthouse
security
responsibility,
that
is
correct.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
again,
it
is
a
matter
of
judicial
power
to
require
the
marshal
to
do
that.
we
think
not.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
the
court
of
appeals
looked
over
a
somewhat
broader
exception
where
the
security
needed
required
the
custody
be
transferred
outside
the
courthouse.
it
is
unclear
exactly
what
that
means,
but
they
left
that
open.
but,
the
rationale
is
not
that
the
marshal
has
any
independent
responsibility
for
the
prisoner-witnesses,
but
rather
he
has
responsibility
for
the
security
of
the
courthouse.
so,
when
they
are
in
the
courthouse,
whether
it
is
in
the
lockup
or
the
elevator
or
the
courtroom,
the
marshal
would
be
responsible
for
custody.
when
they
are
outside
the
courthouse,
even
in
a
federal
jail
or
detention
center,
that
would
not
be
within
the
scope
of
569(a),
the
courthouse
security
provision
for
the
marshal.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
the
marshal
would
have
the
discretion
how
to
implement
the
courthouse
security.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
whether
he
is
to
be
responsible
for
security,
we
would
agree,
could
be
imposed
by
the
judge.
now,
whether
it
requires--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--that
would
be
under
569(a)
of
28
u.s.
code.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
it
says
that
the
marshal
may,
in
the
discretion
of
the
court,
be
required
to
attend
any
session
of
court.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
and,
if
the
marshal
has
agreed
and
not
raised
any--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--the
marshal
hasn't
challenged
that
construction
of
the
statute.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
think
it
is
certainly
within
the
marshal's--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--we
think
it
is
certainly
a
permissible
reading
for
the
marshal
to
make
of
its
own
statute,
that
this
confers
power
on
the
court
to
do
that.
that
is
correct.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
as
on
any
statutory
construction,
the
reading
of
the
agency
whose
statute
it
is
is
entitled
to
substantial
deference.
it
would
be
controlling,
of
course,
but
it
would
be
relevant
and
significant.
now,
absent
legislative
authorization,
our
submission
is
that
a
court
cannot
require
the
marshal
to
transport
state
prisoners
regardless
of
its
view
of
the
reasonableness
of
that
order.
the
question
then
is
whether
there
is
any
lawful
authority
for
the
transportation
order
issued
in
this
case.
there
plainly
is
no
such
explicit
authority,
so
the
question
is
one
of
implied
authority.
now,
our
analysis
starts
from
the
proposition,
which
is
essentially
undisputed,
that
under
settled
principles,
it
is
the
obligation
of
the
custodian
to
produce
its
prisoners
in
court
pursuant
to
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
ad
testificandum.
indeed,
if
the
prisoners
in
this
case
were
in
federal
rather
than
state
custody,
it
would
be
the
responsibility
of
the
marshal
to
transport
them
to
court.
the
result
we
seek
here
asks
that
state
to
do
no
more
with
respect
to
its
own
prisoners.
the
custodian's
obligation
to
produce--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--our
point
here
though
is
that
the
custodian
has
the
obligation
and
we
agree
that
obligation
would
apply
to
us
if
these
were
federal
prisoners,
just
as
it
applies
to
the
state
where
they
are
state
prisoners.
now,
the
custodian's
obligation
to
produce
its
prisoners
existed
at
common
law
and
is
carried
forward
by
the
express
terms
of
the
federal
habeas
corpus
statute.
in
fact,
the
whole
theory
of
the
ad
testificandum
writ
requires
that
the
custodian
be
the
respondent
and
bring
its
prisoners
to
court
since
it
is
the
custodian
that
has
the
control
over
the
prisoner.
it
is
the
fact
that
custody
that
fixes
the
custodian
mandatory
and
non-delegable
legal
duty.
this
obligation
reflects
two
important
considerations.
first,
the
custodian,
like
everyone
else,
has
a
public
duty
to
make
available
evidence
in
its
possession,
here,
the
prisoner
himself,
even
if
that
imposes
a
burden
or
is
inconvenient.
and,
second,
the
custodial
state
has
a
penal
interest
in
the
continued
confinement
of
the
prisoner,
since
it
is
that
confinement
that
gives
rise
to
the
special
problems
and
added
expense
of
obtaining
the
prisoner
in
court.
it
is
not
unfair
or
unreasonable
for
the
law
to
impose
the
production
obligation
on
the
custodian.
since
time
immemorial
until
the
recent
state
of
litigation,
the
entire
system
has
operated
on
the
questioned
rule
that
the
production
obligation
rests
on
the
custodian.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that
is
something
of
an
unanswered
question.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
i
think
that
in
the
end
is
probably
the
right
argument.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
as
i
said,
it
is
unresolved,
but
i
don't
disagree
with
that
proposition.
and,
it
would
be
perfectly
appropriate
for
the
magistrate,
in
exercising
his
discretion,
whether
to
issue
the
ad
testificandum
writ
to
take
into
account
the
very
same
considerations.
there
is
no
absolute
right
for
a
prisoner
or
any
other
plaintiff
to
have
an
ad
testificandum
writ
and
the
magistrate
could
well
say
that
unless
you
make
some
contribution,
even
if
you
are
ifp,
to
the
expenses
involved
here,
i
won't
issue
the
writ.
certainly,
if
he
weren't
ifp,
we
will
take
the
position
that
the
marshal
does
that
the
magistrate
should
exercise
the
discretion
to
require
the
non-indigent
plaintiff
to
pay
for
the
expenses
involved.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that
would
be
correct.
the
magistrate
would
certainly
have
discretion
to
impose
that
obligation
on
a
non-indigent
litigant.
and,
indeed,
we
cite
one
case
in
our
brief,
united
states
versus
$64,000.00
in
currency,
where
that
is
exactly
what
the
trial
court
did.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
think
there
was
an
effort,
but
unfortunately
it
was
unsuccessful.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
yes,
they
are,
and
almost
in
all
instances
they
work
in
a
cooperative
way.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
believe
efforts
were
made
and
they
were
simply
unsuccessful.
and,
part
of
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
order
in
this
case
departs,
as
the
magistrate
conceded,
from
the
historical
practice
in
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania.
for
a
long
time,
the
marshal
was
not
involved
in
this.
the
state
was
responsible
for
transporting
its
prisoners.
in
return--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--i
believe
that
they
did
try
to
work
it
out.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
was
not
party
to
the
discussions.
i
am
not
certain
of
that.
but,
if
they
did
try,
they
were
unable
to
work
out
the
differences.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
but,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
not
whether
the
parties
can
work
it
out.
clearly
the
marshal
would
have
authority
to
entered
into
a
cooperative
agreement
where
it
thought
it
was
proper
in
the
exercise
of
its
executive
discretion.
the
issue
here
is
whether
the
marshal
for
good
and
sufficient
reasons
chooses
not
to
enter
into
such
a
cooperative
agreement,
whether
the
magistrate
can
require
under
his
judicial
authority
to
require
the
marshal
to
do
so
nonetheless.
and,
although
it
was
neither
relied
on
by
the
magistrate
nor
raised
by
the
state
in
the
courts
below.
the
state
now
places
principal
reliance
on
the
all
writs
act,
28
u.s.c.
1651.
the
state
contends,
in
effect,
that
section
1651
is
a
preformed
and
virtually
unbounded
grant
of
authority
to
judges
to
devise
any
and
all
writs
that
they
consider
to
be
desirable.
we
disagree
with
that
exceedingly
expansive
view
of
the
statute,
especially
as
applied
to
the
federal
executive
branch.
the
all
writs
act
is
not
a
codification
of
standardless
discretion
for
judges
to
do
good.
instead,
it
establishes
two
requirements.
first,
the
writ
must
be
necessary
or
appropriate
for
the
court's
exercise
of
its
jurisdiction;
and,
second,
it
must
be
agreeable
to
the
usages
and
principles
of
law.
the
order
in
this
case
satisfies
neither
of
those
elements.
the
order
is
not
necessary
or
appropriate
since
there
is
a
well-established
means
available
to
obtain
the
prisoners.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
under
some
extreme
circumstances,
it
might
be
necessary
and
appropriate
in
the
literal
sense.
and,
certainly
if
the
court
disagrees
with
our
submission
here,
it
should
limit
any
discretion
the
trial
court
has
for
those
exceptional
circumstances.
but,
even
there
i
still
think
there
would
be
a
substantial
question
whether
the
magistrate,
as
an
arm
of
the
executive
branch,
could
require
that
the
marshals
transport
state
prisoners.
considerations
of
separation
of
power
and
sovereign
immunity
apply
here
as
they
do
in
any
other
case
and
we
don't
think
the
all
writs
act
circumvents
those
traditional
considerations.
now,
in
addition
to
being
necessary
or
appropriate,
the
writ
also
has
to
be
agreeable
to
the
usages
and
principles
of
law.
the
order
in
this
case
doesn't
satisfy
that
requirement
either.
quite
the
contrary.
the
order
sought
by
the
state
is
inconsistent
with
and
in
contravention
of
the
custodian's
time-honored
obligation--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--the
marshal,
as
a
matter
of
executive
discretion,
could
agree
and
the
regulations--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--well,
there
would
be
two
sources.
first,
generally
executive
officials
have
broad
discretion
to
do
many
things
that
they
are
authorized
and
not
required
to
do.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
it
would
be
an
inherent
exercise
of
executive
authority
to--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--no,
but
our
position
would
be
that
the
attorney
general,
who
supervises
the
marshals,
has
the
inherent
authority
to
direct
the
marshals
in
the
exercise
of
their
normal
duties
and
that
where
there
is--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--there
are
many
instances
where
there
is
inherent
authority
or
authority
that
is
implied
from
the
statute,
if
you
will,
that
is
not
express
authority.
that
has
never
been
thought
to
be
a
bar
to
the
executive
exercise
in
his
discretion
to
take
a
particular
act.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
there
is
a
considerable
difference
between
authorizing
the
executive
to
do
something--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--that
is
an
important
part
of
our
argument.
i
would
also
say,
justice
white,
that
there
is
a
statute
that
provides
that
the
marshal
is
to
be
allowed
the
expense
of
transporting
prisoners.
now,
that
doesn't
itself
constitute
a
substantive
authorization
to
transport
prisoners,
but
it
does
mean
that
where
the
transportation
is
authorized,
then
it
will
be
covered
by
the
united
states
treasury.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
where
it
did
not
itself
carry
out
the
transportation?
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
in
the
circumstances
of
the
seventh
circuit
case
where
there
was
an
outstanding
order
to
the
marshal
to
transport
them,
the
marshal
simply
ignored
that
order.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
am
not
certain
of
the
answer.
i
would
be
doubtful.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
but--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--but,
the
marshals'
power--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--the
marshals'
power
would
be
to
engage
in
activities
that
are
within
the
control
of
the
attorney
general.
where
it
has
engaged
in
activities,
i
don't
know
that
the
attorney
general
would
have
the
authority
to
give
away
money
of
the
treasury.
i
simply
am
not
certain
of
that.
it
is
not
the
issue
presented
here.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
but,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
the
power
of
the
court,
not
the
power
of
the
attorney
general
or
the
executive
branch
to
do
something
on
its
own.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
it
is
a
common
situation.
for
example,
the
united
states
attorney
has
discretion
to
prosecute
or
not
taking
into
consideration
any
number
of
factors.
it
would
never
be
thought
though
that
simply
from
that
a
court
could
require
the
u.s.
attorney
to
exercise
that
authority
in
a
particular
way
and
at
the
direction
of
the
court.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
doubt
that
that
would
be,
but
here,
the
duties
are
those
of
a
kind
the
marshal
normally
exercises
and
i
think
it
is
within
the
attorney
general's
control
to
indicate
how
the
marshals
should
be
deployed.
that
is
really
the
core
of
the
executive
branch's
function
here.
now,
let
me
say
that,
first,
the
attorney
general
has
promulgated
regulations
that
say
the
marshal
can
enter
into
intergovernmental
or
cooperative
agreements.
so,
the
attorney
general
has
recognized
the
authority
to
do
that.
and,
second,
the
marshal,
in
fact,
does
provide
assistance
to
states
in
many
areas.
for
example,
apprehending
fugitives
from
state
custody
even
though
no
federal
offense
had
been
committed.
the
marshals
will
assist
the
states
in
the
marshals'
discretion
for
free
or
in
transporting
state
prisoners
between
states
for
state
proceedings.
the
marshal
will
often
help
the
states
do
that
without
charge.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
once
again,
the
marshal
would
be
free
in
this
case,
but
in
those
other
instances,
he
decides
that
the
transportation
of
a
particular
prisoner
in
a
particular
set
of
circumstances
does
not
detract
from
the
exercise
of
his
other
duties.
he
may,
for
example,
have
a
plane...
this
is
one
of
the
hypotheticals
the
court
suggested...
and
he
knows
that
there
is
empty
space
and
no
additional
guards
would
be
needed.
so,
he
exercises
his
discretion
to
assist
the
state.
the
order
in
this
case
doesn't
depend
in
any
way
on
that
determination.
and,
the
authority
of
a
court,
the
power
of
a
court
to
order
the
marshal
to
do
simply
wouldn't
be
workable
if
it
depended
on
that
kind
of
precises
deployment
of
the
marshals'
resources.
the
court
is
in
no
position
to
assess
those
kinds
of
considerations
or
make
the
judgments
that
are
entrusted
to
the
marshal
as
an
executive
official.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that
is
correct.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
anything
that
is
properly
addressed.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
let
me
discuss
the
statute
there
which
is
what
the
magistrate
specifically
relied
on,
28
u.s.c.
569(b),
which
provides
that
the
marshal
shall
execute
all
lawful
writs,
process
and
orders
of
federal
courts.
that
provision,
which
has
been
in
the
code
since
1789,
sets
for
the
marshals
traditional
obligation
to
execute
court
orders.
it
establishes
the
marshal
as
the
designated
official
for
executing
judicial
process
and
makes
clear
that
the
marshal,
even
though
a
part
of
the
executive
branch,
has
a
mandatory
duty
to
do
so.
we
concede
all
of
that.
but,
section
569(b)
is
not
an
independent,
affirmative
source
of
judicial
authority
to
address
orders
to
the
marshal.
rather,
it
simply
requires
that
the
marshal
execute
those
orders
that
under
some
other
source
of
lawful
authority
are
properly
directed
to
it.
to
give
a
specific
illustration,
the
case
at
hand,
the
fact
that
a
trial
court
is
empowered
to
issue
an
ad
testificandum
writ
to
someone,
that
is
the
custodian,
does
not
mean
that
it
can
issue
the
writ
to
the
marshal.
a
contrary
conclusion
would
mean
that
the
marshal
can
be
required
to
perform
any
order
whose
substantive
terms
are
not
prohibited.
under
this
theory,
any
court...
any
order
that
a
court
can
enter
at
all
could
be
directed
against
the
marshal
in
the
first
instance,
but
simply
by
the
fact
that
it
is
addressed
to
him
the
marshal
would
be
bound
to
carry
it
out.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
am
afraid
i
didn't
understand
the
question,
justice.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
to
serve
the
writ,
yes.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that
is
right.
but,
that
is
far
different.
that
is
the
sort
of
execution
that
the
marshal
is
authorized
by
other
provisions
of
law
to
make.
there
is
no
other
provision
of
law
that
authorizes
or
requires
him
at
the
direction
of
the
court
to
bring
state
prisoners
into
federal
court
in
order
to
relieve
the
state
custodian
of
its
legal
obligations.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
they
were
orders.
i
don't
believe
they
were
styled
as
writs,
but
there
were
orders
issued
here
jointly
to
the
state
and
to
the
marshals,
that
is
correct.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
am
not
certain
of
the
answer
to
that.
it
may
have
been
that
they
were
simply
served
by
mail
or
that
the
marshal
may
have
served
them.
the
state
has
never
challenged
that
they
were
properly
served.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
it
may
be
that
there
is
an
official
for
service
in
philadelphia.
i
simply
don't
know
what
arrangements
there
are
for
service
on
the
state
of
pennsylvania.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
it
has
not.
we
proposed
that
in
our
brief
and
our
position
in
this
case,
but
the
court
stay
its
hand
to
allow
the
legislative
process
to
go
forward.
we
said
that
we
would
propose
legislation.
the
court
granted
certiorari
in
this
case
and
it
is
very
difficult
to
get
legislation
proposed
or
considered
when
the
very
issue
is
pending
in
a
case
before
the
court.
so,
no
legislation
has
been
sought
so
far.
i
can
only
assume
that
after
this
court
has
rendered
its
decision,
the
losing
side
will
then
seek
appropriate
legislation
in
congress
and
that
is
where
we
think
the
issue
ought
to
be
resolved,
as
we
told
the
court
before.
it
is
a
matter
for
congress
to
decide
in
the
end
as
a
policy
question,
how
the
marshals'
resources
should
be
spent,
whether
the
marshal,
to
transport
state
prisoners,
in
addition
to
or
instead
of
its
currently
prescribed
duties.
but,
absent
legislative
authorization
of
that
kind,
there
is
simply
no
legal
authority
for
the
trial
court
to
require
the
marshal
as
an
arm
of
the
executive
branch,
to
transport
state
prisoners
to
federal
court.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
we
think
if
the
marshal
wanted
to,
it
could
do
so,
that
is
correct.
and,
that
is
nothing
more
than
the
typical
instance
of
executive
discretion
to
take
acts
within
its
generally
authorized
area
of
responsibility.
the
real
problem
in
this
case
is
that
orders
of
the
type
entered
by
the
magistrate
here
will
impair
marshals'
ability
to
carry
out
the
existing
functions
that
are
assigned
to
it.
thank
you.
