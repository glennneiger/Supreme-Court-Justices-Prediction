justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
during
the
day
at
the
federal
courthouse
he
is
in
federal
custody,
as
i
understand
it,
and
nobody
disputes
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
who
buys
his
lunch
if
he
has
to
spend
the
day
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
levy,
can
i
interrupt
with
a
question
that
goes
to
the
question
of
power
rather
than
whether
it
is
a
good
idea
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
you
had
an
emergency
situation,
a
fire
at
the
county
detention
center
or
an
escape
or
a
riot
or
something
like
that,
and
the
state
was
short
of
personnel
and
couldn't
get
a
witness
to
the
courthouse
and
they
let
the
district
judge
know
and
the
district
judge
said,
well,
we
want
to
go
ahead
with
the
trial
and
it
is
the
only
way
we
can
get
the
witness
here.
it
is
absolutely
necessary
in
order
to
have
the
trial
go
forward
is
to
send
a
marshal
out
and
pick
him
up.
would
you
make
the
same
argument
that
he
has
no
power
to
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let's
assume
the
question
is
one
of
power.
in
that
situation,
would
the
judge
have
the
power
to
order
the
marshal
to--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what
would
be
the
source
of
the
federal
judge's
authority
to
enter
such
an
order?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
take
my
hypothetical.
it
is
just
an
emergency
and
the
judge
thinks
the
only
way
he
could
really
get
the
witness
there
is
to
order
the
marshal
to
go
out
and
get
him.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
assume
you
get
a
state
of
facts
which
you
would
agree
for
purposes
of
my
question
that
it
is
either
necessary
or
appropriate
to
go
get
him.
would
there
be
power
to
order
the
marshal
to
go
get
him?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
that,
in
jurisdictional
terms,
the
same
issue
that
we
have
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
just
delivers
him
from
the
intermediate
point
to
the
courthouse.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
get
one
other
thing
straight
in
my
mind.
the
government
concedes,
as
i
understand
it,
that
after
the
prisoners
and
witnesses
are
delivered
to
the
federal
courthouse...
i
guess
they
are
taken
to
a
lockup
downstairs
or
something...
that
the
marshal
then
can
be
ordered
to
continue
to
hold
custody
of
them
in
the
elevators
and
throughout
the
building,
not
merely
in
the
courtroom.
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
you
had
a
situation
as
you
do
in
chicago
where
there
is
a
federal
detention
center
about
a
block
from
the
federal
courthouse.
could
they
be
ordered
to
take
custody
at
the
federal
detention
center
and
haul
them
back
and
forth
across
jackson
parkway?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
you
would
say
the
extent
of
judicial
power
is
the
exterior
walls
of
the
building
which
houses
the
federal
courthouse?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
if
the
marshal
has
the
responsibility
for
the
courthouse,
where
does
the
judge
get
the
power
to
tell
the
marshal
what
do
it
in
the
courthouse?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
judge
can
order
the
marshal
though
to
be
responsible
for
security
in
the
elevator.
that
is
not
a
matter
for
the
marshal
to
decide
for
himself.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
source
of
the
judge's
power
to
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
says
what
about
judge's
power?
justice
john
paul
stevens
any
session
of
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
any
session
of
court
includes
riding
up
and
down
an
elevator.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
do
you
think
it
is
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no.
within
the
court's
power
to
order
him
in
the
elevator.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
the
judge
should
defer
to
the
expertise
of
the
marshal
in
construing
that
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
as
a
follow-up
on
justice
white's
question
that
if
instead
of
volunteering
to
do
the
transportation
initially
you
had
a
situation
in
which
the
state
had
done
the
transportation,
as
was
true
in
the
seventh
circuit
case,
and
then
came
in
and
asked
for
reimbursement
from
the
marshal.
the
seventh
circuit
held
that
they
could
be
ordered
to
reimburse
them.
you,
of
course,
disagree
with
that
case,
but
would
you
agree
that
the
marshal
could
voluntarily
reimburse
the
state
for
the
cost
of
transportation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
state
just
sent
a
bill
and
said
we
produced
all
these
prisoners
and
it
cost
us
this
much
money.
justice
john
paul
stevens
assume
it
just
went
to
the
state
and
they
said,
well,
we
will
decide
who
bears
the
expense
later
and
after
the
case
is
over
the
state
just
calls
up
the
marshals
and
said
it
cost
us
$400
to
transport
these
prisoners,
would
you
mind
paying
it.
would
the
marshal
have
the
authority
in
its
inherent
power
in
your
view
to
pay
that
bill?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
is
it
different
as
a
matter
of
power
whether
you
pay
it
in
advance
or
later?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
the
same
power.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
the
same
burden
on
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
it
relates.
we
are
dealing
with
inherent
power
here,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
view
is
the
marshal
has
greater
discretion
than
the
judge?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
levy,
as
i
understand
it,
since
about
1976
or
1977
the
circuits
that
have
addressed
this
problem
have
all
gone
the
other
way
from
the
third
circuit.
and,
has
the
marshals
service
or
the
attorney
general
ever
asked
congress
to
take
a
look
at
this
problem
in
the
intervening
period?
