justice

day
o'connor
mr.
kneedler,
do
you
think
that
constitutional
challenges
to
the
application
of
the
secretary's
guidelines
concerning
part
b
can
be
challenged
in
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
they've
certainly
made
a
constitutional
claim.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
did...
it
did
appear
to
me,
anyway,
that
the
plaintiffs
below
made
three
different
kinds
of
challenges.
one
was
to
the
carrier's
utilization
and
application
of
the
secretary's
rules
on
part
b,
and
second
was
a
challenge
to
the
secretary's
regulations
themselves,
and
an
allegation
that
the
secretary's
regulations
did
not
meet
the
statutory
requirements
that
congress
had
laid
down,
and
third,
a
constitutional
challenge.
now,
do
you
think
that
erika
precludes
the
constitutional
challenge?
i
guess
you
think
not,
but
you
think
it's
insubstantial?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
about
an
allegation,
that
the
regulations
of
the
secretary
simply
don't
conform
to
the
statute?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
language
in
erika
doesn't
make
too
clear
that
that
was
intended.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
why
would
a
challenge
to
the
regulation
as
not
meeting
the
statutory
requirement
be
a
burden
to
the
court
such
as
review
of
the
typical
part
b
benefit
claim?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
kneedler,
erika
said
it
didn't
rely
on
405-h.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
that
mean
it's
open
to
us
to
hold
that
405-h
just
precludes
review
of
claims
for
which
review
is
available
under
405-g?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
kneedler,
in
ringer
it
seemed
to
me
the
claimants
could
obtain
judicial
review
as
provided
under
405-g,
and
that
just
isn't
the
case
here
so
i
suppose
we
haven't
technically
answered
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
it's
open
for
the
secretary
to
provide
by
regulation
for
administrative
review
of
claims
like
this
under
part
b?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
the
mechanism
in
place
now
to
review
a
carrier's
development
of
guidelines
or
rules
to
govern
how
physicians'
services
are
going
to
be
compensated?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
question
here
is
so
basic.
it's
an
allegation
that
the
statute
says
if
the
services
provided
by
the
physicians
are
identical,
that
no
different
level
of
compensation
is
permitted,
based
on
specialization,
and
that's
a
pretty
basic
question,
isn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
kneedler,
in
the
other
cases
the
court
has
had,
wasn't
at
least
review
by
the
carrier
of
the
issue
available?
