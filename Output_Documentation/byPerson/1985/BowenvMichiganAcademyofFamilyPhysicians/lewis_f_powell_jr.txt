mr.
kneedler,
will
you
clarify
for
me
why
the
difference
between
part
a
and
part
b
review
is
so
significant?
part
a
provides
very
substantial
review.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
judicial
review,
and
my
understanding
is,
part
a
provides
for
reimbursement
of
hospitals.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
why
the
difference?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
part
b
would
involve
greater
amounts
of
money?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
for
clarification,
are
you
simply
stating
that
the
equal
protection
question
is
not
before
us
at
all?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
did
the
lower
court
say
that
the
equal
protection
issue
was
so
insubstantial?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
is
the
ag's
position?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
it
your
position
that
the
construction
of
the
statute
is
not
here
either?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so,
you
would
leave
the
construction
of
the
statute
to
somebody
engaged
by
blue
cross-blue
shield
who
may
not
be
a
lawyer
at
all?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
you're
still
going
to
leave
the
construction
of
the
regulation
to
someone...
to
blue
cross-blue
shield
to
make
that
decision
with
no
appeal?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
sort
of
oversight?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
has
that
sort
of
annual
oversight
ever
been
accepted
as
satisfactory
in
terms
of
providing
some
sort
of
appropriate
administrative
or
judicial
review
of
a
major
issue?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
basically,
erika
simply
involved
the
question
of
whether
or
not
individual
claimants
could
argue
about
the
amount
of
benefits?
