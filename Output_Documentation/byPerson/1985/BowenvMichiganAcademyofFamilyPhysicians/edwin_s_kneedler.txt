mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
respondents
have
a
right
to
judicial
review
of
matters
concerning
the
amount
of
benefits
under
part
b
of
the
medicare
program.
part
b
establishes
a
voluntary
program
of
supplementary
medical
insurance
that
pays
in
general
80
percent
of
the
reasonable
charge
of
physician
services
and
other
services.
part
a
of
the
program,
which
establishes
the
basic
hospital
insurance
program,
is
not
directly
involved
in
this
case.
the
principal
relevance
of
part
a
here,
however,
is
that
under
part
a
congress
has
expressly
provided
for
judicial
review
of
benefit
determinations
where
the
amount
in
controversy
exceeds
$1,000,
and
this
demonstrates
that
where
congress
intends
to
provide
for
judicial
review
under
the
medicaid
program,
it
expressly
does
so.
under
part
b,
however,
congress
has
not
affirmatively
authorized
judicial
review.
four
terms
ago,
in
united
states
versus
erika,
this
court
unanimously
held
that
by
this
omission
congress
had
deliberately
foreclosed
judicial
review.
the
court
there
relied
on
what
congress
perceived
to
be
the
relatively
insubstantial
amount
of
money
involved
in
the
typical
part
b
claim.
the
court
adhered
to
this
view
of
reviewability
under
part
b
just
two
terms
ago
in
heckler
versus
ringer.
although
congress
has
extensively
revised
the
part
b
program
in
a
number
of
respects
since
erika
was
decided,
it
has
not
enacted
legislation
to
overrule
that
decision.
bills
have
been
introduced
to
accomplish
that
result,
however,
and
as
we
point
out
in
our
reply
brief
the
committee
reports
on
those
bills
demonstrate
congress's
understanding
that
under
existing
law
judicial
review
is
entirely
foreclosed
under
part
b.
in
these
circumstances
we
believe
it
would
be
especially
prudent
for
the
court
to
adhere
to
its
rulings
in
erika
and
ringer
and
leave
to
congress,
which
is
studying
the
matter,
the
question
of
whether
exceptions
should
be
carved
out
to
that
preclusion.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
of
course
we
think
that
issue
is
not
presented
here
because
the
particular--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--they
have
made
a
constitutional
claim,
but
it
is
our
submission,
for
the
reasons
we
have
stated
in
the
brief,
that
it
is
so
insubstantial
as
not
to
vest
the
court
with
subject
matter
jurisdiction
under
the
rationale
that
the
court
disposed
of
the
constitutional
claim
in
ringer
itself.
we
think
that's
so
because
the
regulation
that's
being
challenged
simply
authorizes
the
establishment
of
separate
charge
screens,
or
prevailing
charge
screens,
based
on
the
charging
patterns
that
exist
in
the
community,
and
where
a
carrier
implements
that
principle
and
adopts
separate
prevailing
charge
screens
that
are
simply
based
on
the
charging
patterns
in
the
community,
we
think
that
that
can
in
no
way
be
thought
to
be
so
utterly
lacking
in
rational
justification
under
flemming
versus
nestor
as
to--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
yes.
erika,
we
think,
didn't
address
it
because
there
was
not
a
constitutional
question
raised.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
on
that
question,
we
think
the
judicial
review
is
plainly
foreclosed.
in
erika...
erika
itself
involved
a
challenge
to
instructions
from
the
secretary
that
is,
insofar
as
the
carrier
is
concerned,
there
is
binding
regulations,
and
the
court--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
the
court
of
claims
decision
in
erika,
however,
at
pages
590
to
591
of
634
f.
2d
do
discuss
the
carrier's
challenge
to
the
intermediary
letter
upon
which
the
carrier
relied
and
also
several
additional
letters
implementing
that,
and
the
court
of
claims
did
review
the
carrier's...
the
question
of
the
carrier's
reliance
on
those
letters
and
held
that
they
were
not
a
valid
basis
for
the
carrier
to
deny
claims.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the
typical
part
b
benefit
claim
might
well
often
include
a
challenge
to
a
regulation
or
instruction
or
legal
principles
upon
which
the
carrier
relied,
and
it
would
not
be
difficult
for
a
claimant
to
allege
that.
and
i
would
point
but
that
there
are
now
over
300
million
claims
a
year
filed
under
the
part
b
program
and
more
than
30
million
enrollees,
so
the
potential
for
bringing
these
questions
into
court
is
rather
substantial,
in
our
view.
also,
the
premise
of
erika
that
congress
has
precluded
judicial
review
of
matters
concerning
the
amount
of
benefits
extends
not
simply
to
the
factual
determinations
but
to
the
legal
ones
as
well,
because
a
decision
on
a
claim
for
benefits
is
really
analogous
to
a
court's
judgement
which
includes
not
simply
findings
of
fact
but
the
application
of
law
to
it,
and
so
where
congress
has
precluded
review
of
a
decision
concerning
the
amount
of
benefits,
that
necessarily
includes
the
legal
rules
that
the
carrier
has
applied
in
arriving
at
that
determination.
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief
from
the
beginning,
the
regulations
governing
the
carrier
hearing
program
have
provided
that
the
carrier's
decision
on
a
claim
for
benefits
is
final
and
binding
and
it
is
not
subject
to
further
review,
and
that
the
carrier
is
to
adhere
to
the
secretary's
view
of
the
meaning
of
the
statute
and
regulations.
putting
these
together,
we
think
it's
quite
clear
that
the
preclusion
of
review
of
amount
of
benefits
under
part
b
includes
questions
of
law
or
regulations.
one
other
point
i'd
like
to
make
in
this
regard
is
if
the
secretary
had
never
issued
the
regulation
involved
in
this
case,
and
the
carrier
had
simply
relied
on
its
own
interpretation
of
the
statute,
that
it's
clear
that
judicial
review
would
be
precluded
under
the
rationale
of
erika
because
there
in
erika
as
here,
there
was
a
statutory
challenge
to
the
prevailing
fee
limitation
that
the
carrier
was
using.
in
fact,
it
was
a
challenge
based
on
the
very
same
sentence
of
the
act
upon
which
respondents
rely
in
this
case.
all
that
has
happened
here
is
that
the
secretary
has
given
some
interpretive
guidance
to
the
carriers
explaining
what
he
understands
the
act
to
mean,
but
the
issuance
of
a
regulation
should
not
in
our
view
provide
a
vehicle
for
judicial
review.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
guess
at
some
point
the
secretary's
actions
would
be
so
far
removed
from
the
administration
of
the
program
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
would
hesitate
to
give
definitive
answer,
but
i
would
think
it
might
well
be
because
for
one
thing
it
doesn't
really
concern
the
amount
of
benefits
or--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
it
may
well
be,
but
because
the
secretary
would
not
be
giving
directions
on
how
to
adjudicate
particular
claims--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
it
would
be
beyond
that.
that
would
be,
among
other
things,
collateral
to
the
substantive
determination
of
the
claim
and
the
amount
of
the
claim.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
will
effect
the
claim,
but
what
we
have
here
is
something
that
goes
directly
to
the
amount
of
benefits
which
is
at
the
core
of
what
congress
has
precluded.
it's
what
1395
ff
affirmatively
authorizes
review
of
under
part
a
and
hence
precludes
review
of
under
part
b.
the
prevailing
fee
limitation
is
an
essential
element
in
the
calculation
of
the
reasonable
charge,
and
claimant
cannot
separate
out
that
particular
issue,
legal
issue
of
the
prevailing
charge.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
that
is
essentially
our
position.
the
abolishment
of
the
claims
adjudication
process
is
not
an
issue
that
arises
in
the
adjudication
process
itself.
it's
wholly
external
to
it.
and
once
you
get
out
of
the
claims
adjudication
process,
then
the
argument
for
judicial
review
might
be
stronger.
but
the
principle
that
we're
relying
on,
and
it's
not
just
in
the
medicare
program
but
it's
reflected
more
broadly
in
section
405-h
of
the
act,
is
that
in
the
social
security
act
congress
has
carefully
considered
when
it
wants
to
have
judicial
review.
it
affirmatively
authorizes
it
typically
by
incorporating
section
4o5-g,
the
provision
for
judicial
review
in
district
court.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
i
think
not.
i
think
ringer
forecloses
that
argument.
in
ringer
the
argument
was
made
that
because
the
one
claimant,
ringer,
had
not
submitted
a
claim
for
benefits
and
therefore
could
not
get
into
the
claims
adjudication
process
that
culminates
in
405-g,
that
he
should
have
a
right
of
action
under
the
general
type
of
question
jurisdiction,
1331,
the
argument
being
that
405-h
shouldn't
preclude
review
where
it's
not
available
under
the
act.
and
the
court
rejected
that
proposition,
saying
that
the
scope
of
405-h
does
not
expand
or
contract
depending
upon
whether
review
is
otherwise
available.
in
fact,
the
whole
purpose
of
405-h
is
to
preclude
review
except
where
congress
has
provided
for
judicial
review.
this,
we
have
shown
in
our
brief
particularly
by
reference
to
the
legislative
history
of
the
enactment
of
405-h.
the
second
sentence
of
that
provision
on
says
that
no
findings
or
decisions
of
the
secretary
shall
be
reviewed
by
any
tribunal
except
as
herein
provided,
referring
to
section
405-g,
and
under
the
part
b
program
the
carrier
acts
as
the
secretary's
agent
and
as
the
court
recognized
in
erika,
the
secretary
is
the
real
party
in
interest
on
an
issue
arising
under
part
b.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the
one
claimant
had
not
filed
a
claim
and
therefore
was
not
within
the
judicial
review...
the
administrative
review
process
that
would
culminate
in
section
405-g,
and
he
was
saying
that
because
405-g
was
not
available,
that
federal
question
jurisdiction
should
be
available.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
he
hadn't
had
the
operation,
but
that
was
simply--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
that's
right,
but
the
court
made
the
point
that
a
court
cannot
essentially
issue
a
declaratory
judgment
under
the
1331
jurisdiction
to
expound
on
a
legal
issue
arising
under
the
medicare
program.
the
legal
issues
have
to
be
taken
to
court,
if
at
all,
under
405-g
and
that's...
the
same
principle
applies
here.
congress
has
not
permitted
the
courts
to
grant
declaratory
judgments
or
injunctive
relief
under
the
general
grant
of
federal
question
jurisdiction.
it
has
provided
a
review
mechanism,
but
unlike,
under
the
part
a
program
involved
in
ringer,
congress
has
withheld
judicial
review.
and
the
third
sentence--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--before
the
carrier.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
a
doctor
can
assert
a
claim
before
the
carrier
if
he
accepts
assignment
from
the
part
b
beneficiary,
the
doctor's
rights
are
then
entirely
derivative
of
those
of
the
patient
and
he
can
submit
a
part
b
claim
to
the
carrier.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
does.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
it
was
congress's
judgment
in
enacting
the
medicare
program
that
part
a
was
typically
going
to
involve
much
greater
amounts
of
money
in
a
typical
claim.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
part
a.
i'm
sorry.
part
b,
claim
can
consist
of
nothing
more
than
a
claim
for
doctor's
visit
which
can
be
$10
or
$15,
and
congress
was
concerned
shout
flooding
the
courts
with
these
relatively
insignificant
claims,
whereas
a
hospital
visit
is
likely
to
give
rise
to
a
substantial
medical
bill.
and
congress
did
provide
for
judicial
review,
but
significantly
it
limited
it
to
situations
in
which
there's
$1,000
or
more
in
controversy.
in
this
case,
the
district
court
allowed
review
apparently
without
regard
to
any
amount
of
controversy.
indeed,
the
one
beneficiary
who
is
a
plaintiff
in
this
case,
the
practical
difference,
the
difference
in
reimbursement
levels
that's
at
issue
here
is
about
$1.60
an
office
visit.
it
seems
to
us
that
this
is
precisely
the
sort
of
minor
reimbursement
dispute
that
congress
wanted
to
keep
out
of
the
courts.
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
also
the
bills
that
are
pending
before
congress
now
would
make
the
part
b
review
provisions
parallel
to
those
under
part
a
and
allow
for
judicial
review
only
where
there
is
that
$1,000
in
controversy.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
may
well
be.
there
are
existing
mechanisms
for
the
secretary
to
review,
not
in
every
case
but
the
secretary
has
a
quality
review
mechanism
whereby
a
sample
or
the
carrier's
cases
are
reviewed
periodically.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
there
are
several.
there
is
an
annual
evaluation
of
the
carrier's
performance
that
is
conducted
by
the...
that
is
conducted
by
hcfa,
the
health
care
financing
administration,
which
is
an
assessment
of
the
carrier's
overall
performance.
this
is
discussed
at
some
length
in
our
briefs
in
mcclure
four
terms
ago.
one
aspect
of
that,
and
it's
discussed
in
the
testimony
in
the
record
in
this
case,
was
that
there
was
an
evaluation
of
the
prevailing
charge
levels
that
the
carrier
uses,
not
necessarily
poring
over
the
statistical
data
but
just
making
sure
that
the
carrier
is
using
the
right
approach
in
evaluating
that
question.
the
other
form
of
oversight
is,
as
i
mentioned,
quarterly
quality
reviews
of
the
carrier's
performance
by
individual
hearing
officers.
another
mechanism
available
to
a
person
affected
by
the
part
b
program
would
be
to
file,
and
particularly
in
this
case
where
there's
a
regulation
of
the
secretary,
would
be
to
file
a
rule-making
petition
with
the
secretary.
if
the
respondents
in
this
case
believe
that
in
fact
the
data
now
supports
elimination
of
any
differential
in
charging
patterns
based
on
specialty,
that
a
petition
for
rulemaking
could
be
submitted
to
the
secretary
along
with
relevant
supporting
data.
so,
there
are
mechanisms
that
can
be
resorted
to,
and
along
these
same
lines
congress
had
last
year
commissioned
a
study
by
the
office
of
technology
assessment
which
we
also
point
out
in
our
brief
under
the
deficit
reduction
act
of
1984,
to
study
the
differences
in
charge
levels
for
physicians'
services
according
not
only
to
specialty
differences
but
the
locality
and
the
type
of
service.
so,
there's
also
rather
extensive
congressional
oversight
or
the
way
in
which
the
part
b
program
is
administered.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
what
the
statute
says
is
that
the
reasonable
charge
cannot
exceed
75
percent
of
the
customary
charges
for
similar
services.
it
certainly
seems
to
us
to
be
a
reasonable
construction
of
the
phrase,
"similar
services,
to
take
into
account
differences
in
specialty,
and
in
fact
this
regulation
was
promulgated
at
the
very
time
the
medicare
program
was
being
implemented.
"
so,
we
don't
have
here
any
aberrational
or
startling
implementation
of
the
act.
in
45
states
the
carriers
are
using
this.
i
would
point
out
again
that
in
erika
the
statutory
challenge
to
the
prevailing
charge
ceiling
was
under
the
very
same
statutory
provision.
that
sentence
requires
that
the
similar
charges
be
accumulated
and
evaluated
as
made
during
the
preceding
calendar
year,
and
the
provider
there
argued
that
during
the
calendar
year
means
over
the
course
of
the
calendar
year.
it
doesn't
permit
the
carrier
to
select
just
one
date
in
the
middle
of
the
year.
and,
i
submit
that
that
is
every
bit
as,
in
one
sense,
basic
to
the
way
the
program
is
being
administered,
but
the
court
unanimously
held
that
judicial
review
is
foreclosed.
and
this
is
essential
in
a
program
of
this
magnitude
with
300
million
claims
annually,
to
have
the
oversight
be
conducted
by
an
expert
agency,
by
the
secretary,
in
reviewing
the
manner
in
which
the
carriers
perform.
and
this
is
done,
as
i
have
said,
through
the
oversight
function,
and
to
have
judicial
review
of
these
matters
without
regard
to
the
amount
in
controversy
as
permitted
here
would
substantially
undermine
the
efficiency
of
the
program.
one
other
point
i
wanted
to
make
about
reviewing
the
regulation
is
that
not
only
did
erika
involve
instructions
analogous
to
a
regulation
but
so
did
ringer
itself.
in
fact,
that
was
the
principal
challenge
of
ringer,
was
a
contesting
of
an
instruction
that
prohibited
a
carrier
from
paying
any
amount
of
benefits
for
a
particular
service.
what
we
have
here
is
not
a
prohibition
of
the
payment
of
any
amounts,
but
just
concerns
the
amount
of
benefits
which
is
something
that
the
carrier
is
particularly
expert
in
addressing.
several
other
ways
in
which
the
respondents
and
the
court
of
appeals
have
attempted
to
avoid
the
force
of
erika
and
ringer
in
this
case,
i
think
also
should
be
addressed.
one
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
suggested,
is
that
the
preclusion
of
review
under
erika
and
ringer
doesn't
apply
to
someone
other
than
the
claimant
for
benefits.
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
explain
what
it
meant
by
that,
but
it
apparently
meant
positions
rather
than
the
part
p
beneficiary.
respondents
don't
defend
that
argument
here,
and
i
don't
see
how
it
could
be
defended,
because
in
erika
itself
it
wasn't
the
beneficiary.
it
was
the
assignee,
the
provider
of
the
services
who
brought
the
action,
and
judicial
review
was
foreclosed.
by
the
same
token,
respondents
argue
that
they
aren't
really
bringing
a
claim
for
benefits
in
the
sense
that
they
want
monetary
relief
directly
from
the
court.
they
are
just
challenging
the
methodology
for
the
calculation
of
the
prevailing
charge.
again,
this
was
exactly
what
was
at
issue
in
erika.
the
court
of
claims,
whose
judgment
was
reviewed
here,
did
not
get
into
the
question
of
adjudicating
individual
claims.
they
remanded
to
the
carrier
to
apply
what
it
viewed
as
the
correct
standards,
and
had
the
carrier
process
the
claims.
so,
again
that
furnishes
no
basis
for
distinguishing
erika
or
ringer.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
was
brought
in
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct,
but
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
could
not
have,
although
in
a
sense
it
granted
the
equivalent
by
a
remand
to
the
carrier.
it
didn't
award
a
money
judgment.
it
remanded
the
matter
to
the
carrier
to
compute
the
benefits
under
what
the
court
of
claims
viewed
as
being
the
proper
legal
standard,
which
is
exactly
what...
exactly
the
relief
that
the
respondents
ask
for
in
this
case,
as
to
how
the
prevailing
charge
screens
were
formulated.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
that
would
be
unlikely
to
happen
because
if
there
appears
to
be
on
average...
the
nonspecialists
are
reimbursed
at
a
lower
level,
so
if
they're
put
in
one
screen
presumably--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--in
individual
cases
it--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
this
lawsuit
wouldn't
give
them
money,
but
the
consequence
of
the
judgment
would
in
most
cases,
particularly--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
the
secretary
isn't
authorized
to
reduce
it
to
the
lowest
level.
the
calculation
has
to
be
based
on
75
percent,
what
would
cover
75
percent
of
charges
in
the
area.
so,
if
the
secretary
says,
or
if
the
court
said
that
you
had
to
combine
the
lowest
prevailing
charge
level
with
the
highest,
bring
them
together,
then
the
consequence
is
going
to
bring
up
the
lowest
and
bring
down
the
highest.
so,
it
will
have
the
consequence
of
raising
the
amount
of
benefits
payable
in
most
cases
to
the
people
treated
by
family
physicians.
there
may
be
some
situations,
and
the
record
suggests
there
are
a
few
situations,
in
which
general
practitioners
or
nonspecialists
actually
receive
more,
but
in
the
typical
case
they
receive
less,
or
the
beneficiary
receives
less,
and
so
it
would
nave
the
effect
of
raising
the
benefits.
of
course,
in
ringer
you
had
much
the
same
situation.
you
had
a
regulation
that
absolutely
precluded
recovery.
the
consequence
of
that,
even
though
not
what
the
ninth
circuit
would
have
ordered,
but
the
consequence
of
saying
that
the
secretary
could
not
rule
it
out
would
be
to--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i'm
not
aware
of
the
situation
but
analytically
it's
no
different
from
precluding
judicial
review
of
any
administrative
action,
because
in
administering
a
program
an
executive
agency
relies
on
law,
statute,
and
implementing
regulations,
and
if
congress
can
preclude
judicial
review
even
where
someone's
alleging
that
there's
a
statutory
violation,
as
was
true
in
erika.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
there
are
quite
a
few
of
them
that
involve...
quite
a
few
of
the
cases
that
involve
challenges
to
regulations.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
exactly
right.
in
fact,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
section
405-g
contemplates
review
of
regulations
as
part
of
review
of
the
final
decision.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
and
that
seems
to
us
to
be
clear,
that
congress
views
405-g
as
the
avenue
not
only
for
review
of
factual
issues
but
review
of
regulations
and
the
legislative
history
expressly
says
that
a
court
can
review
questions
of
law
on
review.
so,
when
congress
makes
405-g
applicable,
it
is
saying,
we
are
authorizing
judicial
review
not
only
of
facts
but
of
regulations
and
law.
where
congress
has
withheld
it,
it
has
withheld
those
same
issues
from
judicial
review.
if
there
are
no
more
questions
now,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
several
points,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
the
government
did
not
concede
in
district
court
that
the
exclusion
of
board
eligible
family
physicians
from
the
one
charge
screen
was
unconstitutional
or
irrational.
we
simply
said
that
by
virtue
of
the
changing
of
the
eligibility
requirements
for
family
physicians,
they
should
now
be
included.
so,
this
is
not
a
case
that
ever,
i
would
argue,
raised
a
substantial
constitutional
question.
the
other
point--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
there's
several
points.
neither
court
below
decided
that
question.
we
also
think
that
in
any
event,
that
is
so
insubstantial
on
the
merits
that
it
does
not
vest
this
court
with
subject
matter
jurisdiction
the
same
way
that
the
claim
in
ringer
itself
did
not.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
the
lower
courts
did
not
resolve
the
equal
protection
question.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
our
position
is
that
the
equal
protection
argument
is
insubstantial,
so
insubstantial
as
to
not
vest
the
court
with--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
construction
of
the
statute
is
not
here
because
we
believe
congress
has
precluded
judicial
review
of
the
question
of
the
construction
of
the
statute.
the
court
of
appeals
did
address
the
question
of
the
construction.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
the
issue
of
statutory
construction
involved
here
is
embodied
in
the
regulation
issued
by
the
secretary,
and
in
fact
issued
by
the
secretary
in
1967
when
the
medicare
program
was--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
there's
oversight
by
the
secretary,
as
i
pointed
out
earlier,
annually.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
there's
an
annual
review
of
the
carrier's
performance
by
the
secretary's
agents
to
make
sure
that
the
regulation
is
being
properly
implemented.
we
would
also
like
to
point
but
that
this--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
the
congress
has
frequently
foreclosed
judicial
review
of
questions
of
law.
last
year
the
court
held
that
judicial
review
was
foreclosed
in
the
chaney
case.
in
erika,
in
fact,
congress
held
that
a
question
relating
to
what
the
carrier
did
was
lawful
under
the
statute
was
foreclosed
by
congress.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
the
basis
for
their
claim
was
that
the
approach
the
carrier
took
to
computing
the
prevailing
charge
was
inconsistent
with
the
statute,
inconsistent
with
the
same
sentence
of
the
statute
upon
which
the
respondents
in
this
case
relied,
and
similarly
in
ringer
there
was
a
regulation
issued
by
the
secretary,
of
nationwide
scope,
that
could
not
be
appealed
to
the
secretary.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
not
in
ringer.
ringer
involved
part
b
as
well
as
part
a,
and
one
of
the
claims
in
ringer
was
that
the
secretary's
instructions
that
barred
the
carrier
from
awarding
any
benefits
for
the
particular
service
was
invalid,
and
the
court
held
in
footnote
4
of
its
opinion
that
judicial
review
is
entirely
foreclosed
even
as
to
that
statutory
challenge
to
the
regulations
at
issue
in
ringer.
so,
it
was
not
a
situation
involving
another
avenue
of
judicial
review.
thank
you.
