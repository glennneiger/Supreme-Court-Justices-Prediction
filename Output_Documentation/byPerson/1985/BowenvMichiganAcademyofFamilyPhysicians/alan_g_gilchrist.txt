mr.
alan
g.
gilchrist
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
two
basic
issues
on
the
merits
of
this
case
where
petitioners
state
the
respondents
have
no
relief
whatsoever.
the
first
issue
pertains
to
the
equal
protection
claim,
and
the
placement
of
family
physicians,
and
those
patients
who
choose
family
physicians,
separate
from
all
other
physicians
and
essentially
equating
the
selection
of
a
family
physician
with
that
of
a
chiropractor
or
a
podiatrist.
now,
the
government
states
today
that
that
equal
protection
count
had
no
merit.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
the
government
filed
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
on
that
issue.
it
was
heard.
it
was
denied.
and
the
government
did
not
appeal
that
decision.
it
is
also
a
fact
that
the
lower
court
in
this
case
stated
that
the
government's
action
utterly
lacked
merit,
utterly
lacked
reason,
rather.
the
sixth
circuit
pertained
to
the
government's
action
as
durational.
but
perhaps
most
important,
as
to
the
government's
position
today,
as
the
government
conceded
at
trial
it
had
no
rationale
for
the
placement
of
board
eligible
family
physicians
who
all,
by
definition,
have
completed
residency
programs
along
with
chiropractors
and
podiatrists
and
sep
rate
from
their
peers.
the
statutory
question
is
basically
the
other
major
issue.
it's
important
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
medicare
statute
repeatedly
uses
the
word
"similar
services"
in
determining
reasonable
charges
under
part
b
of
the
medicare
program.
the
regulation
in
question
doesn't
even
contain
the
words
"similar
services".
nobody
testified
at
trial
in
this
case
that
the
secretary
attempted
to
define
"similar
service",
or
that
the
secretary
even
considered
similarity
of
service
in
implementing
this
regulation.
basically,
it
is
the
respondent's
position
that
a
reasonable
and
consistent
interpretation
of
the
medicare
statute
is
that
there
is
1331
jurisdiction
for
both
these
issues.
we've
also
addressed
the
issue
of
due
process
and
separation
of
powers,
but
i
think
it
is
essentially
not
important
for
purposes
of
a
statutory
interpretation
because
we
firmly
believe
that
a
consistent
reading
of
the
statute
supports
the
respondent's
position.
and
we
have
tried
to
set
forth
in
detail
the
types
of
issues
for
which
there
is
no
judicial
review
and
the
types
of
issues
for
which
there
is
judicial
review.
one
of
the
problems
i
have
with
the
petitioner's
position
before
this
court
is,
they
have
never
explained
in
any
detail
what
types
of
issues
there
may
be
judicial
review
of.
let
me
give
you
an
example.
do
the
petitioners
maintain
today
that
when
a
lawsuit
is
filed
on
the
basis
of
equal
protection,
and
the
government
concedes
no
rationale
for
its
actions,
that
there
is
no
federal
court
judicial
review
or
no
forum
anywhere
to
address
the
issue?
the
government
makes
that
concession,
at
least
to
the
portion
of
the
claim
in
this
case,
and
then
ignore
it,
and
essentially
they
refuse
to
grant
any
relief
voluntarily
and
they
maintain
no
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court,
and
apparently
by
making
that
concession
all
they
want
to
accomplish
is
to
have
the
respondents
quit
talking
about
it.
to
give
another
example,
let's
assume
that
the
secretary,
by
regulation,
decided
not
to
pay
family
physicians
at
all,
or
the
patients
that
choose
family
physicians,
but
those
services
aren't
similar
to
anybody
else's
services,
so
they
just
won't
pay
them
at
all.
is
that
subject
to
review
anywhere?
or,
the
secretary
is
satisfied
that
the
office
visits
performed
by
family
physicians...
and
incidentally,
their
paint
of
$1.50
an
office
visit,
that
was
one
type
of
office
visit.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
for
comprehensive
office
visits
for
carol
diedrich,
they
cut
it
in
half
from
$50
to
$25.
but
if
the
secretary
is
prepared
and
satisfied
that
the
office
visits
performed
by
family
physicians
are
similar
to
office
visits
performed
by
chiropractors,
i
suppose
the
secretary
might
take
one...
just
one
step
further
and
decide
that
they
were
only
covered
for
office
visits
and
spinal
stipulations
on
the
part
of
family
physicians.
is
that
subject
to
no
review?
if
the
secretary
promulgates
the
regulation
of
sickle
cell
anemia,
services
will
not
be
paid.
is
that
subject
to
review?
perhaps
that's
a
suspect
clasification,
well,
let
me
give
another
example.
a
terminally
ill
patient,
they
die
too
soon.
we
won't
pay
for
those
services.
clearly
in
conflict
with
the
statute,
does
the
government
state
there
is
no
review
for
those
types
of
issues?
now,
i've
conceded
under
the
erika
case,
there
is
no
judicial
review
of
an
amount
of
benefit
determination
made
by
a
clearing
officer
after
hearing,
and
that
is
the
issue
in
the
erika
case,
not
whether
there
is
judicial
review
of
any
issue
concerning
the
amount
of
benefits
for
which
there
may
be
no
other
determination
available.
it
says
a
mouthful,
that
concession,
and
the
case
law
tells
us
the
types
of
issue
the
carrier
routinely
conducts
hearings
on.
in
the
mcclure
case,
for
example,
whether
a
sex
change
operation
is
medically
necessary,
whether
an
ambulance
should
have
taken
a
patient
to
the
nearest
hospital
or
to
a
hospital
30
miles
away,
whether
an
appendectomy
performed
on
the
same
patient
on
the
same
day
can
be
billed
along
with
other
major
abdominal
surgery
or
if
it
is
incidental
to
and
included
as
part
of
the
bill
for
the
appendectomy,
from
the
herzog
case
from
the
sixth
circuit,
or
the
rainer
case,
whether
a
medical
procedure
is
a
recognized
and
bona
fide
medical
procedure
that
the
medicare
program
should
pay.
mr.
alan
g.
gilchrist
that's
precisely
the
point,
your
honor,
that
this
issue
in
this
case,
several
issues
of
statutory
construction,
but
the
reality
of
this
case
is,
there
is
no
hearing,
the
carrier
has
expertise
and
authority,
expertise
and
experiencer,
rather,
as
well
a
authority
to
make
the
decision
on
issues
such
as
the
issues
that
i've
set
forth.
they
make
those
types
of
determinations
every
day
in
their
private
insurance
business,
and
congress
delegated
to
a
private
insurance
company
under
1395-u
the
authority
to
make
the
same
types
of
determinations
and
to
conduct
hearings
to
make
those
types
of
determinations
under
part
b.
that's
in
substantial
contrast
to
this
case.
this
case
involves
a
constitutional
claim
and
a
claim
that
a
regulation
promulgated
by
the
secretary
violates
the
medicare
statute.
certainly
the
carrier,
non-lawyer
hearing
officer,
has
no
great
expertise
and
experience
to
address
this
type
of
issue,
but
perhaps
more
importantly
the
secretary
recognizes
that
fact
when
the
secretary
implemented
the
statute,
because
the
secretary
specifically
barred
the
carrier
hearing
officer
from
making
any
comment
on
it,
never
mind
making
a
determination
on
the
legality
of
a
regulation
promulgated
by
the
secretary.
here
we
asked
for
a
hearing
and
the
government
quite
correctly
stated
we're
not
entitled
to
a
hearing
on
these
issues,
and
then
they
turn
around
in
the
same
breath
state,
well,
if
there's
any
mechanism
at
all
it's
the
carrier
hearing
mechanism.
congress
simply
did
not
intend
to
delegate
those
types
of
issues.
the
legislative
history
makes
that
clear.
let
me
point
out
just
very
briefly,
on
the
separation
of
powers
and
the
due
process
issue
that
i've
pressed
from
the
briefs...
i
don't
want
to
get
into
detail
as
to
northern
pipeline,
the
mathews
versus
eldridge,
and
the
mcclure
case
which
is
a
medicare
part
b
case,
but
i
concede
that
there
is
a
great
deal
of
flexibility
in
the
amount
of
due
process
that
must
be
afforded
in
social
welfare
cases
to
balance
the
private
interest
involved
and
the
risk
of
erroneous
deprivation
versus
the
public
interest
in
avoiding
the
burden
of
having
to
provide
additional
hearings.
by
the
way,
both
the
mathews
case
and
the
mcclure
case
were
allegations
of
entitlement
to
additional
hearings.
here
there
can
be
no
meaningful
hearing
at
any
time
on
the
issues
that
have
been
raised,
and
i
think
this
court
has
steadfastly
maintained
the
position,
they
certainly
did
in
the
mathews
versus
eldridge
case,
that
if
due
process
means
anything
it
means
a
meaningful
hearing
at
a
meaningful
time.
here
there
is
no
hearing
before
the
carrier.
there
is
no
hearing
before
a
federal
agency.
and
if
you
accept
the
petitioner's
position
in
this
case,
there's
no
hearing
before
any
court.
erika,
according
to
petitioners
today,
stands
for
the
proposition
that
there
is
no
judicial
review
of
any
issue
that
may
affect
the
amount
of
benefits
under
part
b
of
the
medicare
program,
whether
there's
a
determination
available
anywhere
else.
i've
gone
back
and
looked
at
the
erika
case.
i've
looked
at
the
decision
of
the
carrier
in
that
case.
i've
looked
at
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
that
case.
and
i
simply
don't
agree
that
the
carrier
is
bound
by
any
instructions
in
that
case.
the
issue
was,
during
the
last
preceding
year,
the
statutory
issue,
the
regulation
used
the
same
words,
during
the
last
preceding
year.
there
was
a
small
issue,
basically
a
side
issue
concerning
retroactive
adjustment
in
that
case,
that
may
or
may
not
have
involved
a
carrier
following
instructions
from
the
secretary
in
the
form
of
letters,
i
guess.
but
i
couldn't
find
in
the
opinion
where
the
carrier
stated
that
they
were
bound
and
could
not
make
such
determination.
but
i
think
more
important
than
that,
if
the
government
wants
to
take
the
position
that
erika
stands
for
the
proposition
that
there's
no
hearing
on
any
issue
that
may
involve
the
amount
of
benefits,
whether
another
available
mechanism
is
available,
even
through
a
carrier
hearing,
they
should
have
disclosed
that
to
the
court
at
that
time.
i
note
that
justice
powell's
opinion
in
the
erika
case
paraphrases
in
essence
what
the
position
of
the
petitioners
was
at
that
time.
there
it
is
stated
that
the
petitioner
argues
that
congress
specifically
precluded
review
in
the
court
of
claims
of
adverse
hearing
officer
determinations
of
the
amount
of
part
b
benefit
payments.
the
position
of
the
respondents
today
is
that
a
consistent
reading
of
the
medicare
statute...
and
incidentally,
the
erika
case
was
based
upon
not
a
specific
statement
from
congress
because...
from
the
statute,
because
1395
double-f
does
not
explicitly
bar
judicial
review
of
anything.
rather,
it
relied
upon
the
grant
of
judicial
review
of
determination
for
the
amount
of
benefits
under
part
a
of
the
medicare
program
and
silenced
the
part
b,
coupled
with
the
legislative
history
to
reach
the
conclusion
that
there's
no
review
of
hearing
officer
determinations
after
hearing
the
amount
of
benefits
under
part
b
of
the
program.
but
the
legislative
history,
and
a
logical
and
a
consistent
reading
of
that
statute,
is
that
the
congressional
intent
to
bar
jurisdiction
under
part
b
ties
in
directly
and
is
related
to
the
issues
where
congress
gave
authority
to
the
carrier
to
make
those
types
of
determinations
under
1395-u.
and
the
issues
that
congress
intended
to
bar
are
those
issues
such
as
the
types
i've
already
raised
where
the
carrier
has
expertise
and
has
authority,
and
the
legislative
history
supports
not
petitioner's
interpretation
about
that,
but
rather
respondent's.
the
senate
committee
report
which
petitioners
cite
as
authority
for
their
position
at
the
inception
of
the
passage
of
the
medicare
statute
simply
stated
that
there
was
a
hearing
on
the
amount
of
benefits
under
part
b
of
the
medicare
program
by
the
carrier
and
there
is
no
judicial
review
of
such
determinations.
or
when
the
statute
was
amended
in
1972,
again
petitioners
rely
upon
this
language,
the
conference
committee
report
also
cited
in
erika
opinion,
states
there
is
no
authorization
for
judicial
review
under
part
b
for
matters
involving
solely...
and
that's
congress's
word,
not
mine...
the
amount
of
benefits.
it's
simply
the
logic
and
consistent
reading
of
the
statute,
taken
in
proper
context,
is
congress
intended
that
some
issues
certainly
be
conducted
through
a
carrier
hearing,
and
there
is
no
judicial
review
of
that
carrier
determination.
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
congress
intended
to
preclude
any
issues
under
part
b
of
the
medicare
program.
let
me
talk
about
weiner
and
salfi
for
a
moment,
as
well
as
405-a.
mr.
alan
g.
gilchrist
first
of
all,
there's
a
serious
question
here
as
to
whether
this
could
be
an
amount
of
benefit
case
at
all,
and
let
me
give
you
some
examples.
the
board
certified
family
physicians,
respondents
in
this
case,
are
asking
for
a
reduction
in
benefits,
in
essence,
if
you
accept
the
government's
position
about
equalizing
the
amount
of
payments
because
they
are
in
the
specialist
screen.
the
context
of
amount
of
benefits,
the
language
of
the
legislative
history
that
pertains
to
determinations
on
amount
of
benefits,
and
even
within
part
a
where
they
grant
judicial
review
of
determinations
on
amount
of
benefits,
has
to
be
tied
in
together
with
the
grant
of
authority
to
the
carrier
to
make
determinations
on
amount
of
benefits.
we
could
dance
all
day
in
terms
of
what
those
three
words
mean,
amount
of
benefits.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
when
we
read
the
legislative
history
we
know
what
congress
meant
by
those
words.
it
meant
those
issues
for
which
the
carrier
has
expertise
and
experience
and
for
which
a
hearing
can
be
conducted
at
the
carrier
level.
does
that
help
clarify
it
at
all?
okay,
thank
you.
as
to
405-a
in
salfi
and
weiner,
the
interesting
part
about
the
petitioner's
brief
is,
they
don't
cite
a
single
case
for
the
proposition
that
the
last
sentence
of
405-h
which
states
that
there
is...
no
action
may
be
taken
under
1331
against
the
secretary,
u.s.
government
officer
and
employee
thereof
to
recover
on
any
claims.
they
don't
cite
a
single
case
where
that
last
sentence
was
taken
out
of
context
with
the
balance
of
405-h
which
is
clearly
precluding
1331
jurisdiction
of
findings
and
decisions
of
the
secretary
after
a
hearing,
and
precluding
judicial
review
by
any
tribunal
of
findings
and
decisions
of
the
secretary
after
a
hearing.
i
don't
want
to
get
into
a
dispute
as
to
whether
or
not
ringer
had
a
sufficient
reason
for
attempting
to
bypass,
and
that's
clearly
what
that
was,
a
bypass
of
the
review
mechanism
under
part
a.
he
attempted
to
bypass
405-b
and
405g.
i
think
the
strongest
statement
that
may
be
made
from
the
weiner
decision
is
where
congress
has
provided
for
a
federal
administrative
hearing
such
as
they
did
under
405-b
and
where
congress
has
provided
for
judicial
review
of
that
federal
administrative
hearing
such
as
they
did
in
weiner
under
405-g,
that
mechanism
must
be
followed
and
there
is
no
reason
that
may
justify
a
bypass.
i
think
that's
about
as
we
can
go
in
the
weiner
decision,
and
that
states
it
very
strongly.
justice
rehnquist
in
that
decision
stated
that
the
last
sentence
of
405-h
cannot
change
meaning
based
upon
whether
or
not
a
party
has
followed
the
mechanism
available
within
405-g,
whether
they've
satisfied
prerequisites,
i
think
were
the
exact
words.
but
here
that's
an
absolute,
irrelevant
issue.
there
are
no
prerequisites
under
405-g
for
the
respondents
to
follow
because
405-g
simply
doesn't
apply,
and
the
proper
context,
the
last
sentence
of
1331,
simply
states
that
one
may
not
bring
1331
jurisdiction
to
review
a
decision
by
the
secretary
through
an
administrative
hearing
process
where
405-g
provides
the
judicial
review.
that's
in
essence,
also,
the
finding
in
the
salfi
decision.
as
i
stumble
through
the
interpretation
of
the
medicare
statute
i'm
reminded
by
a
statement
justice
powell
made
in
the
gray
panther
lawsuit.
he
quoted
from
lower
court
decision
that
characterized
the
social
security
act
a
an
aggravated
assault
on
the
english
language,
and
i
certainly
agree
with
that
statement.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
a
single
sentence
from
the
statute
or
even
worse,
a
single
sentence
from
the
legislative
history
can
be
taken
out
of
context
to
support
virtually
any
position
anybody
wants
to
take,
and
i
think
that's
in
essence
what
the
government
has
done
here.
they've
taken
the
last
sentence
of
405-h
and
they've
ignored
the
balance
of
that
section
which
is
clearly
in
the
context
of
no
1331
jurisdiction,
where
congress
has
provided
for
a
federal
administrative
hearings
for
judicial
review,
and
they
are
attempting
to
take
that
sentence
outside
of
that
context
and
say
that
clearly
and
convincingly,
congress
intended
to
bar
1331
jurisdiction
for
any
claims
under
part
b.
mr.
alan
g.
gilchrist
i
find
that
very...
i'm
glad
you
asked
that
question
because
i
meant
to
talk
about
the
court
case.
i
handle
a
great
number
of
part
b
cases.
i
think
i'm
familiar
with
a
number
of
part
b
cases
for
which
one
goes
into
federal
court
in
the
state
of
michigan,
at
least,
and
i
would
wager...
i'm
not
positive...
that
this
court
has
been
asked
to
hear
more
part
b
cases
involving
jurisdiction,
and
there's
been
part
b
cases
filed
in
the
senate
of
michigan,
in
federal
district
court
on
the
merits,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
michigan
is...
blue
cross
blue
shield
of
michigan
is
the
tenth
largest
carrier
in
the
country.
but
what
the
government
does
is
to
keep
raising
this
floodgate
issue,
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
circuits
prior
to
erika
found
jurisdiction
even
on
the
types
of
issues
we
now
concede
there's
not
jurisdiction,
and
they've
never
supplied
this
court
with
the
data
as
to
the
number
of
cases
that
have
been
filed,
the
number
of
federal
district
court
cases
or
court
of
claims
cases.
and
to
date
they
haven't.
i
simply
don't
feel
that
there
ever
was
a
floodgate.
i
don't
want
to
rehash
the
erika
case,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
today
they
raise
the
issue
of
floodgates
but
they
don't...
they
don't
provide
this
court
with
any
data
that
would
indicate
that
in
fact
there
would
be
such
result.
i
think
that
this
is
a
very
unusual
case,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
a
case
that
first
of
all
the
government
sees
no
rationale
in
the
equal
protection
issue,
and
also
as
justice
o'connor
indicated,
it's
quite
a
very
basic
statutory
point,
and
furthermore--
mr.
alan
g.
gilchrist
--i
don't
quarrel
with
that.
those
are
claims
submitted
in
part
b
of
the
medicare
program.
the
question
i'm
raising
is
a
number
of
cases
filed
in
the
federal
district
court.
that's
the
issue
of
raising
the
floodgates.
mr.
alan
g.
gilchrist
i'm
sorry.
i
misunderstood.
on
this
precise
issue,
very,
very
few.
i
mean,
i
suppose
even
if
i
don't
prevail,
the
courts
are
open
from
nine
to
five.
anybody
can
file
a
lawsuit.
but
on
the
limited
construction
that
i
am
stating,
where
there
is
judicial
review
on
those
issues
where,
the
carrier
cannot
and
has
been
stripped
of
authority
to
make
a
determination,
i'm
not
sure
if
there
is
another
case
like
this
to
be
honest
with
you,
and
there
have
been
other
cases
filed
in
federal
court.
i'm
not
sure
if
there's
been
a
case
in
the
country
where
the
government
when
finally
pushed
to
the
wall
stated
that
they
had
no
rationale
whatsoever
for
its
actions
in
the
face
of
an
equal
protection
attack
for
example...
so
i
simply
don't
feel
there
would
be
many.
i
obviously
can't
give
a
precise
number,
but
it
certainly
would
be
few.
the
lower
court
stated
this
issue,
and
not
the
trial
judge
but
the
judge
who
heard
the
motion
for
summary
judgment,
better
than
i
can
state
it.
he
stated
that
he
finds
it
improbable
that
congress
would
delegate
to
a
private
insurance
company
the
authority
to
violate
the
united
states
constitution
or
the
medicare
statute
in
congress's
name
with
impunity.
and
that's
the
issue
of
this
case.
i
submit
that--
mr.
alan
g.
gilchrist
--that's
right,
but
that
is
those
are
the
terms.
that
is
the
issue
in
this
case.
but
what
i
submit
is
that
if
congress
intended
this,
congress
would
have
said
so.
the
section
1395
that
the
petitioners
rely
upon
on
their
405-h
argument
simply
says
that
405-h
shall
apply
to
medicare
to
the
extent
applicable
to
title
2
cases.
is
that
a
clear
statement
by
congress
that
they
intended
this
result?
and
the
result,
i
think,
should
be
made
even
more
clear.
what
petitioners
are
alleging
today
is
that
congress,
while
it's
provided
a
forum
for
insignificant
disputes,
albeit
without
judicial
review,
performed
before
the
carrier
to
decide
issues
such
as
whether
an
ambulance
should
have
taken
a
patient
to
the
nearest
hospital
or
to
a
hospital
30
miles
away,
congress
intended
no
forum
and
no
authority
for
anybody
to
address
constitutional
issues
and
statutory
issues.
stated
another
way,
the
more
significant
the
issue
the
less
likely
that
congress
afforded
any
remedy
whatsoever
or
intended
to
afford
any
remedy
whatsoever
for
those
affected
by
the
violation
of
the
statute
or
the
u.s.
constitution
to
obtain
any
relief.
if
congress
intended
this,
somewhere
but
not
within
the
statute
at
least
within
the
legislative
history,
i
submit
petitioners
should
find
a
statement
where
congress
says
this,
and
they
simply
haven't.
if
there's
no
questions,
i
basically
have
no
more
to
add.
thank
you.
