justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
the
secretary
promulgated
a
regulation
abolishing
carrier
review
entirely?
would
that
be
reviewable,
do
you
suppose...
just
said
it
cost
too
much
money?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
that
would
be
reviewable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let's
say
he
just
abolished
carrier
reviews
for
certain
kinds
of
injuries,
broken
legs
or
something,
no
carrier
review
in
certain
kinds
of
injuries.
would
that
be
reviewable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
argument
would
be,
he's
not
complying
with
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
particular
claimant
wouldn't
get
his
broken
leg
paid
for.
i
mean,
whatever
category
of
review
you
take
out,
you
know,
it
would
affect
some
claims.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
the
scope
of
your
position
is
that
whatever
is
authorized
under
a
is
necessarily
forbidden
under
b,
but
something
that's
forbidden
under
both,
you
could
review
under
b?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
he
hadn't,
had
the
operation,
either.
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
he
had
to
do
was
get
the
operation,
file
a
claim,
and
he
would
have
review.
he
just
couldn't
afford
it,
but
that's--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--excuse
me.
you
say
they
have
provided
a
review
mechanism
for
the
claim,
the
doctors--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
how
can
these
doctors
assert
that
claim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask,
erika
was
a
suit
for
monetary
judgment
though,
was
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
whereas
this
is
a
suit
for
an
injunction
against
enforcement
of
regulation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
court
of
claims
could
not
have
granted
injunctive
relief,
could
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
they
might
conceivably
be
reformulated
without
their
getting
any
more
money.
couldn't
they
be
uniform
at
the
lower
level,
for
example?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
presumably
but
not
necessarily?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
be
possible,
would
it
not,
to
grant
all
the
relief
that
they're
entitled
to,
claiming
this
uniformity
principle,
without
giving
them
any
money?
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
if
you
reduced
to
the
lowest
level,
would
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
and
i
of
course
thought
that
argument
was
persuasive
there,
but
the
holding
of
the
court
still
is,
there
is
another
avenue
of
review.
the
thing
that's
novel
about
this
case,
and
you
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
but
is
there
any
other
case,
any
other
time
the
court
has
held
that
any
government
official
can
issue
a
nationwide
regulation
that
is
not
subject
to
judicial
review
of
any
kind,
for
failure
to
comply
with
the
statutory
mandate?
i
don't
think
this
is
ever...
it's
ever
contended
disposition
before,
has
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
that's
true,
but
in
the
vast
majority
of
the
cases
that
come
up
through
the
social
security
system,
and
their
particular
factual
controversies,
and
you've
got
findings
and
the
formal
things
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
sure,
and
i
think
your
position
would
be,
then,
in
ringer
there
could
have
been
a
challenge
to
the
regulation
if
you
followed
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you
do,
mr.
gilchrist,
i'm
not
sure
you've
completely
answered
mr.
kneedler's
argument
that
the
doctor,
if
he
takes
an
assignment
of
a
claim
and
he
doesn't
like
the
two
tier
or
three
tiers,
whatever
it
is,
is
really
asking
for
recovery
that
relates
solely
to
the
amount
of
benefit
that
he
can
get.
why
isn't
solely
the
amount
of
benefit
involved
here?
