mr.
kneedler,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief

e.
burger
mr.
gilchrist.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
these
hypotheticals
of
yours
based
on
a
decision
without
a
hearing
of
any
kind?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
has
anyone,
authoritatively
or
otherwise,
made
any
guess
or
estimate
as
to
how
many
such
claims
for
judicial
review
are
in
the
offing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
my
question
is
not
as
to
how
many
have
been
filed,
how
many
potentially
could
be
filed
if
you
prevail?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
it's
put
in
those
terms
it's
pretty
difficult
to
argue
with
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
kneedler?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
arguments
next.
