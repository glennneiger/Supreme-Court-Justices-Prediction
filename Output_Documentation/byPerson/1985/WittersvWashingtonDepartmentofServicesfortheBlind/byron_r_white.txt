justice
byron
r.
white
has
this
court
ever
funded
religious
education
before?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
mean
that,
of
course,
obviously.
has
it
ever
approved
the
funding
of
religious
education
in
any
decided
case
heretofore?
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
the
state
is
entitled
to
present
that
position,
i
suppose.
it
was
presented
to
the
washington
supreme
court
and
just
wasn't
ruled
on.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
nevertheless,
the
washington
supreme
court
thought
there
was
an
entanglement
issue,
but
it
just
put
it
aside.
and,
i
suppose
the
state
may
argue
for
affirmance
based
on...
it
may
be
an
infirm
argument,
but
they
are
entitled
to
argue
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
don't
think
that
even
if...
for
instance,
you
said
it
would
not
be
an
establishment,
that
you
think
the
washington...
the
state
of
washington
would
have
to
extend
it;
that
it
just
couldn't
say,
well,
whether
this
is
an
establishment
or
not,
we
prefer
not
to
furnish
aid
to
this
kind
of
religious
education.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
the
commission
thought
that
extending
the
aid
would
violate
the
state
constitution.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
have
to
get
to
your
free
exercise
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
you
have
to
win
on
it
really
in
the
long
run
to
do
any
good.
justice
byron
r.
white
adjudication
that
is
reviewable,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
the
way
an
awful
lot
of
the
law
is
made,
by
adjudication.
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
the
only
policy
the
supreme
court
of
washington
purported
to
be
expressing
was
a
federal
constitutional
policy.
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
if
we
just
reverse...
our
usual
mandate
says
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
this
judgment.
then
it
would
just
be
up
to
the
washington
supreme
court.
if
it
thought
the
case
was
over,
the
case
was
over,
but
if
it
wanted
to
decide
the
entanglement
question,
i
don't
suppose
we
could
say
that
it
was
forbidden
to
do
so.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
really
think
we
must
decide
the
free
exercise
clause?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
desire.
i
know
what
you
desire.
[laughter]
but,
you
don't
really
think
we
have
to,
that
it
really
is
an
issue
that
is
required
to
be
decided
to
reverse
the
washington
supreme
court.
