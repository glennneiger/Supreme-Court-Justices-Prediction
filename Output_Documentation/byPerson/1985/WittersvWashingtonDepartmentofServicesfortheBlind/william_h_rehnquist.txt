justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
remand
it
after
this
court
disposes
of
the
issues
that
the
supreme
court
of
washington
did
decide?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
we
don't
have
that
case
at
the
present
time,
do
we?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
is
no
question
that
the
state
of
washington
legislature
passed
a
statute
which
is
construed
by
the
supreme
court
of
washington,
said
we
want
to
fund
this
aid.
the
supreme
court
of
washington
then
says,
no,
you
can't
because
of
the
first
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
now,
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
was
wrong,
then
down
the
road
there
might
be
the
case
where
the
supreme
court
of
washington
would
say,
well,
it
violated
the
state
constitution,
but
it
hasn't
said
that
at
this
stage
of
the
litigation.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
let's
explore
this
a
little
bit
further.
i
realize
you
probably
have
other
things
you
want
to
get
on
to,
but
is
there
a
state
policy
which
says
this
kind
of
education
will
not
be
funded
even
though
the
legislature
has
said
it
should
be
unless
there
is
some
constitutional
difficulty
with
the
funding?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
precisely
is
the
source
of
this
state
policy
to
which
you
referred
in
answering
justice
o'connor's
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean
in
this
particular
case
the
question
was
raised
there
is
a
state
policy
against
it.
now,
what
is
the...
how
does
that
policy
manifest
itself?
who
said
so?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
are
not
talking
about
some
administrator
who
intransigently
refuses
to
carry
out
the
will
of
the
legislature,
even
though
there
are
no
constitutional
impediments
to
him
doing
so.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
a
state
constitutional
policy?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
malone,
that
certainly
isn't
the
position
taken
by
the
supreme
court
of
washington.
i
realize
that
you
differ
from
the
supreme
court
of
washington,
but
certainly
the
easy
way
out
for
the
supreme
court
of
washington
in
this
case
would
be
to
say,
well,
this
statute
doesn't
authorize
what
the
plaintiff
wants,
so
we
don't
have
to
get
to
any
constitutional--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but,
the
supreme
court
of
washington
certainly
took
the
position
that
ministerial
training
was
going
to
be
funded
unless
there
was
a
constitutional
objection
to
it,
don't
you
think?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
malone,
was
this
inland
empire
bible
school,
was
that
an
undergraduate
institution?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and,
if
mr.
witters
had
qualified
under
the
g.i.
bill,
could
he
have
done...
taken
just
the
courses
and
enrolled
for
just
what
he
proposed
to
enroll
under
the
g.i.
bill.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
malone,
i
notice
there
were
hearings
first
before
an
initial
hearing
officer
and
then
a
review
within
the
administrative
agency.
was
any
evidence
as
to
how
the
program
works
or
whether
there
would
be
counselors
involved
brought
out
there?
