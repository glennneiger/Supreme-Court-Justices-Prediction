mr.
michael
p.
farris
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
morning
the
court
has
before
it
a
religion
clause
case
involving
a
vocational
rehabilitation
program
for
the
blind.
it
is
important
to
note
that
it
is
a
neutral
program
and
that
it
is
broadly
available
to
all
blind
citizens
of
the
state
of
washington.
this
is
not
an
occasion
where
the
state
of
washington's
legislature
has
attempted
to
subterfuge
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
go
around
and
find
a
clever
way
to
get
state
aid
through
religious
schools.
nor
is
this
case
where
it
can
be
claimed
that
it
is
not
really
aid
to
individuals,
but
is
a
transparent
fiction
of
aid
to
religious
schools.
mr.
michael
p.
farris
no,
your
honor,
he
was
required
to
drop
out
because
of
lack
of
financial
ability.
mr.
michael
p.
farris
he
was
in
bible
school
which
was
leading
to
a
b.a.
degree,
which
was
an
undergraduate
program,
which
would
have
qualified
him
by
itself
for
certain
ministerial
positions.
mr.
michael
p.
farris
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
it
is
his
desire
to
return
to
the
program
and
to
finish
his
education.
mr.
michael
p.
farris
no,
your
honor,
he
is
washing
dishes
in
a
medical
laboratory.
it
is
our
position
in
this
case
that
there
is
no
justification
under
the
establishment
clause
to
single
out
ministerial
students
for
exclusion
from
participation
in
a
broad
government
program.
we
would
also
argue
that
the
free
exercise
clause
indeed
forbids
such
exclusion.
the
guiding
principle
that
this
court
has
used
in
its
religion
clause
cases
is
the
principle
of
religious
neutrality
and
we
think
that
the
government
does
not
have
to
discriminate
against
religious
persons
in
order
to
prove
how
neutral
it
is.
ministerial
students
do
not
have
to
be
quarantined
from
the
access
to
public
benefits
nor
to
demonstrate
that
the
church
is
committed
to
a
course
of
religious...
or
the
state
is
committed
to
a
course
of
religious
neutrality.
on
the
first
half
of
our
argument,
we
will
deal
with
the
establishment
clause
and
we
must
deal
both
with
the
position
of
the
state
supreme
court
and
the
state
department
for
the
blind,
because
the
state...
department,
although
they
support
the
result
below,
they
have
switched
positions
and
now
have
abandoned
the
reasoning
below
and
are
making
a
new
line
of
argument.
first,
we
will
deal
with
the
state
supreme
court.
that
court
held
that
flatly
the
government
may
never
fund
the
training
of
ministers.
now,
the
problem
with
this
is,
of
course,
that
it
endangers
not
only
this
federal
program
but
the
g.i.
bill,
social
security
recipients
who
use
their
benefits
to
train
for
the
ministry,
and
programs
like
the
federally
insured
student
loan
program.
mr.
michael
p.
farris
if
a
person's
father,
for
example,
passes
away
while
they
are
going
to
college,
they
would
be
eligible
for
certain
dependent's
benefits
under
the
social
security
program
which
they
could
use
for
various
forms
of
training,
including
ministerial
training
among
others.
mr.
michael
p.
farris
the
benefits
that
i
was
referring
to
were
educational
benefits
that
you
are
entitled
to
as
a
student
under
certain
social
security
programs.
the
position
of
the
state
supreme
court,
we
contend,
is
not
in
accordance
with
this
court's
rulings.
this
court
has
never
struck
down
a
neutral
program
that
is
broadly
available
to
all
citizens.
this
court
has
indeed
said
that
such
a
program
is
not
readily
subject
to
an
establishment
clause
challenge.
the
state
supreme
court
held
that
the
primary
effect
of
the
aid
to
witters
was
to
advance
religion.
now,
the
error
in
this
analysis
is
that
they
looked
solely
at
witters,
rather
than
looking
at
the
primary
effect
of
the
entire
program.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
proper
judge
of
the
primary
effect
prong
of
the
court's
tripartite
test
under
lemon
versus
kurtzman...
they
should
have
looked
at
the
entire
program,
not
simply
the
aid
of
witters.
mr.
michael
p.
farris
we
would
concede,
your
honor,
that
this
would
be
a
much
more
difficult
case
here.
we
would
think
that--
mr.
michael
p.
farris
--it
would
be
valid
under
the
establishment
clause.
the
problem
would
be
with
the
free
exercise
clause.
mr.
michael
p.
farris
i
don't
believe
that
it
would
under
this
court's
holdings
in
sherbert
and
thomas.
i
think
that
such
an
express
exclusion
for
religious
persons
only
would
run
counter
to
that,
but
that
is
a
more
difficult
case
to--
mr.
michael
p.
farris
--i
think
there
is
a
difference
between
educational
aid
perhaps
and
vocational
rehabilitation
which
is
career
training.
this
is
job
placement
kind
of
aid
and
under
the
state
of
washington's
law,
this
comes
under
the
public
assistance
code,
not
the
education
code.
and,
this
court's
ruling--
mr.
michael
p.
farris
--it
shouldn't,
but
this
court's
decisions
seem
to
have
treated
various
sections
differently.
sherbert
and
thomas
stand
as
examples
of
public
assistance
benefits
which
have
overturned
exclusions
based
on
religion.
mr.
michael
p.
farris
i
don't
think
that
we
are
required
to
go
that
far,
your
honor.
that,
perhaps,
is
our
position.
but,
this
court's
position,
as
it
has
said
many
times,
to
draw
lines
and
we
think
that
there
is
no
occasion
to
say
that
the
line
should
be
drawn
on
the
other
side
of
this
case
to
exclude
mr.
witters
from
participation.
we
would--
mr.
michael
p.
farris
--no,
this
court
does
not
appropriate
funds.
that
is
the
job
of
the
legislature.
mr.
michael
p.
farris
yes,
your
honor,
it
has.
in
the
case
of
everson
versus
the
board
this
court
held
that
the
education
in
that
case
was
pervasively
religious
and
it
was
the
central
mission
of
the
catholic
church
in
that
case
in
particular
to
religiously
educate
their
children.
that
is
religious
education.
and,
this
court
permitted
an
indirect
benefit
to
that
education
in
the
form
of
transportation
benefits.
in
many
other
cases,
the
aid
to
religion
cases
that
this
court
have
held
have
often
times
involved
institutions
that
admittedly
were
giving
religious
education
in.
various
forms
of
indirect
state
aid
of
those
religious
institutions
have
been
permitted
by
this
court
in
a
number
of
instances.
mr.
michael
p.
farris
your
honor,
his
position
is
that
he
feels
a
religious
call
to
the
ministry,
much
as
reverend
mcdaniel
did
in
the
case
of
mcdaniel
versus
paty,
and
that
is
a
personal
religious
call,
it
is
not
something
the
belief
system
per
se
requires.
it
is
more
of
a
private
direction
between
him
and
god
as
he
perceives
it.
mr.
michael
p.
farris
no.
all
parties
in
this
case,
including
respondent
and
the
solicitor
general's
office,
concede
that
the
g.i.
bill
has
been
used
for
decades
to
allow
persons
to
train
for
the
ministry,
including
a
number
of
seminaries
and
rabbinical
schools
that
are
eligible
currently
for
the
use
of
such
g.i.
benefits.
it
is
our
argument
today
that
this
case
is
constitutionally
indistinguishable
from
such
a
program.
now,
the
state,
department
for
the
blind's
position,
their
new
position
that
they
have
switched
from,
is
based,
first
of
all,
on
arguments
that
are
outside
the
record
and
facts
that
are
outside
the
record.
they,
among
other
things,
are
attacking
for
the
first
time
in
this
court
the
constitutionality
of
the
entire
federal
program,
although
that
issue
was
never
raised
in
any
court
below
and
neither
was
the
fact
to
give
some
potential
relevancy
to
this
federal
program
introduced
below
and
that
is
this
is
the
federal
program
in
question.
there
is
no
factual
proof
of
that
and
counsel
for
the
petitioner
has
no
knowledge
of
whether
that
is
true
or
not.
in
any
event,
these
new
arguments
and
these
new
facts
are
very
easily
answered.
the
federal
statutes
and
regulations
in
question
require
the
state,
according
to
their
argument,
to
evaluate,
to
counsel,
and
to
approve
the
program
of
the
blind
individual
who
comes
into
participation
in
the
vocational
rehabilitation
scheme.
this
can
be
done,
we
would
contend,
objectively.
in
fact,
the
statutes
and
the
regulations
in
contest
require
objectivity.
29
u.s.c.
section
722(b)(4)
that
is
in
the
appendix
of
the
respondent's
brief,
requires
objective
criteria
in
an
evaluation
procedure.
and
34
code
of
federal
regulations,
361.33(b)
lists
those
objective
criteria
such
as
educational
achievement
and
work
experience.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
before
this
court
to
give
rise
to
any
basis
for
speculating
as
to
the
way
the
actual
program
works
under
the
federal
guidelines;
that
there
is
some
violation
under
the
imprimatur
test
or
the
excessive
entanglement
test.
they
simply
would
be
speculation
on
the
part
of
respondent
that
would
even
get
us
into
these
questions
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
such
speculation.
as
we
have
argued
in
our
reply
brief,
we
think
the
perfect
analogy
to
this
situation
is
a
building
inspector
who
is
required
to
approve
a
church's
building
plans.
now,
that
building
inspector
must
evaluate
the
plans,
sometimes
must
counsel
the
church's
architect
or
church's
builder
or
carpenters
on
the
appropriateness
of
their
plan,
the
placement
of
the
pews,
the
placement
of
the
baptistry,
the
location
of
the
altar,
perhaps
for
safety
reasons,
and
they
must
ultimately
approve
those
church
building
plans.
we
contend
that
that
is
the
same
kind
of
situation
that
is
at
hand
today.
both
situations
are
hands-on
in
the
analogy
or
the
criteria
that
is
advanced
by
the
state
in
this
case.
they
have
said
hands-on
funding
of
ministerial
programs
are
unconstitutional,
while
hands-off
programs
like
the
g.i.
bill
are
appropriately
constitutional.
these
may
provide
neat
labels
but
there
is
no
constitutional
justification
for
these
labels.
our
position
is
that
all
citizens
and
all
buildings
must
be
treated
equally.
church
buildings
are
treated
just
like
any
other
assembly
building.
blind
ministerial
students
must
be
treated
equally
just
like
all
other
blind
students.
the
respondent,
however,
does
not
distance
himself
from
the
central
fallacy
of
the
state
supreme
court,
although
they
try
to
basically
repudiate
that
court's
decision;
that
is
they
still
continue
to
focus
on
just
ministerial
students
to
make
their
analysis
of
the
primary
effect
test
and
the
excessive
entanglement
test.
this
court,
in
the
case
of
mueller
and
widmar,
held
that
provisions
of
benefits
to
a
broad
spectrum
of
groups
is
an
important
index
of
secular
effect
and
the
state
chooses
to
ignore
the
fact
that
this
has
been
the
case
here;
that
there
is
a
broad
spectrum
of
groups
of
all
blind
students,
of
all
careers,
that
are
entitled
to
participate
in
a
program.
we
would
suggest
that
there
is
no
imprimatur
of
government
approval
for
religious
institutions
in
this
circumstance.
equal
treatment
has
never
been
held
by
this
court
to
be
an
unconstitutional...
to
create
an
unconstitutional
imprimatur
under
the
terms
of
widmar
versus
vincent
and
a
number
of
other
cases.
there
is
no
fatal
symbolism
in
this
case
as
would
be
suggested
by
the
state.
in
fact,
we
would
say
the
public
would
perceive
this
more
as
an
anti-discrimination
kind
of
law
rather
than
an
endorsement
of
religion
kind
of
law
that
this
court
has
found
to
be
fatally
violating
the
first
amendment.
in
the
case
of
mcdaniel
versus
paty,
this
court
rejected
an
idea
that
is
central
to
the
state's
position
and
that
is
that
ministers
as
symbols
of
the
church
somehow
justify
disparate
treatment
of
those
ministers.
of
course,
we
are
dealing
here
with
ministerial
students
rather
than
those
who
have
accomplished
their
training
and
have
reached
their
desired
career
objective.
there
is
no
constitutional
distinguishment
between
those
two
statuses.
simply
because
larry
witters
wants
to
be
a
minister
the
state
feels
there
is
some
symbolic
violation
of
the
first
amendment
here.
mr.
michael
p.
farris
it
would
not
make
a
difference
to
our
theory--
mr.
michael
p.
farris
--yes.
the
leaders
of
those
faiths
would
be
equally
entitled
to
participate
or
the
leaders
of
secular
faiths
that
this
court
has
recognized
in
certain
of
its
cases.
we
would
contend
that
there
is
no
excessive
entanglement
here
in
the
counseling
program
that
the
state
has
suggested
must
take
place.
the
requirements
are--
mr.
michael
p.
farris
--no.
it
found
the
entanglement
analysis
ill-suited
to
this
case
and
it
found
a
lack
of
facts
in
the
record
to
do
that.
we
think
that
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington
was
right
on
those
points,
saying
that
the
state
did
not
build
its
record
to
bring
an
entanglement
argument.
mr.
michael
p.
farris
well,
it
would
only
be
open,
your
honor,
if
the
state
is
allowed
to
proceed
into
its
new
argument
and
i
think
that
the
face
of
the
record
is
pretty
certain.
at
the
worst
case,
it
should
be
sent
back
rather
than
saying...
holding
that
the
excessive
entanglement
doctrine
has
been
violated
here.
mr.
michael
p.
farris
they
did
not
argue,
your
honor,
at
the
washington
supreme
court
level
or
at
any
level
below
that
the
program
violated
the
first
amendment.
it
was
their
contention
always
before
that
the
first
amendment
was
irrelevant.
so,
it
would
seem--
mr.
michael
p.
farris
--they
are
entitled
to
argue
it
certainly.
mr.
michael
p.
farris
i
think
that
would
be
more
in
line
with
our
position,
your
honor,
but,
in
any
event,
the
state
supreme
court
said
that...
rather
than
there
was
an
entanglement
issue,
they
thought
that
the
analysis
was
ill-suited
to
the
case
and
there
was
no
record.
i
think
they
basically
just
said
the
primary
effect
test
was
the
one
that
was--
mr.
michael
p.
farris
--they
did
use
the
phrase,
your
honor,
that
the--
mr.
michael
p.
farris
--that
is
correct.
they
would
have
been
appropriate
to...
even
if
they
thought
there
was
an
establishment
clause...
an
entanglement
problem,
to
not
decide
the
issue,
but
i
don't
read
their
opinion
as
suggesting
that
they
really
thought
there
was
one
there.
mr.
michael
p.
farris
yes.
justice
utter
made
a
very
thorough
analysis
and
we
are
in
strong
support
of
his
position
in
this
case
and
we
rely
on
it
greatly.
thomas
jefferson
once
wrote,
and
this
court
has
quoted
it
before,
that
the
clergy
here
in
this
country
seem
to
have
relinquished
all
pretentions
to
privilege
and
to
stand
on
the
footing
with
lawyers,
physicians,
etcetera.
they
ought,
therefore,
to
possess
the
same
rights.
that
is
the
central
theme
of
our
establishment
clause
argument,
that
ministers
ought
to
possess
the
same
rights
in
the
department
for
the
blind
as
in
every
other
department
that
is
appropriately
involved
with
ministers
in
the
state
of
washington.
under
the
free
exercise
portion
of
our
argument,
one
of
the...
before
we
get
into
the
merits
of
that,
we
must
address
the
issue
of
whether
this
court
should
decide
the
issue
now
or
remand
it
for
a
decision
of
the
state
constitutional
issue.
some
of
the
amici,
most
particularly
the
solicitor
general's
office,
has
raised
the
suggestion
that
this
case
be
remanded
for
a
decision
of
the
state
constitutional
issue
since
it
would
be,
in
all
fairness,
to
say
that
the
supreme
court
of
washington
hinted
at
the
result
but
ducked
the
issue.
mr.
michael
p.
farris
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and,
although
the
solicitor's
office
does
not
cite
the
case,
some
of
the
other
amici
cite
the
case
of
rescue
army
against
municipal
court.
we
rely
on
widmar
versus
vincent
to
counter
this
argument.
in
the
rescue
army
case,
there
was
a
complex
statutory
scheme
that
was
not
fully
interpreted
by
the
california
courts.
and,
this
court
held
that
remand
is
appropriate
under
circumstances
where
state
law
is
highly
ambiguous
or
if
a
state
law
construction
is
fairly
possible
to
avoid
the
federal
constitutional
issues.
this
court
also
said
in
the
rescue
army
case
that
discretion
would
be
exercised
depending
upon
the
degree
of
uncertainty
about
the
state
law
issue.
in
this
case,
there
is
no
ambiguity,
there
is
no
uncertainty
in
this
case.
if
there
is
a
discretionary
spectrum
involved,
this
case
is
as
far
at
the
end
of
the
uncertainty
side
as
can
possibly
be.
it
is
our
contention,
as
we
argued
in
our
reply
brief,
that
there
is
no
difference
between
this
case
and
widmar
as
far
as
this
issue
is
concerned.
mr.
michael
p.
farris
that
would
be
our
position,
your
honor,
but
that
is
not
this
case.
this
case
is
that
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
washington
chose
to
fund
this
kind
of
aid.
and,
it
is
our
position
that
this
court
ought
to
permit,
both
under
the
establishment
clause
and
the
free
exercise
clause,
the
enforcement
of
that
legislative
will.
mr.
michael
p.
farris
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
p.
farris
well,
it
is
our
position
that
the
state
constitutional
provision
as
so
applied
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
just
like--
mr.
michael
p.
farris
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
p.
farris
that
is
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
p.
farris
it
would
be
analogous
to
sherbert
and
thomas
in
that
kind
of
situation,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
p.
farris
it
is
my
position
that
you
do
not,
because
there
has
been
a
distinction
between
applying
a
constitutional
provision...
i
think
there
is
a
distinction
between
applying
the
state
constitutional
provision
and
the
policymakers
of
the
state
saying
we
want
to
fund
this
aid.
now,
the
state--
mr.
michael
p.
farris
--it
has
not
directly
said.
it
has
hinted
at
it
broadly.
mr.
michael
p.
farris
there
is
a
policy
that
has
been
advanced
but
it
is
not
a
form
of
a
regulation.
it
is
simply
a
letter
ruling
in
effect
and
it
does
not
give...
it
is
not
in
the
state
administrative
code,
so
there
is
a
state
informal
policy.
mr.
michael
p.
farris
and,
there
is
an
adjudication.
mr.
michael
p.
farris
that
is
correct.
and,
it
was
reviewable
at
the
state
supreme
court
and
they
chose
not
to
review
it.
mr.
michael
p.
farris
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
p.
farris
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but,
we
would
contend
that
there
is
no
doubt--
mr.
michael
p.
farris
--that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
p.
farris
that
is
correct.
but,
we
think
the
language
adopted
by
the
seven-member
majority
was
so
clear
as
to
their
intent
of
what
they
would
do
if
they
had
to
reach
the
issue.
they
said,
in
effect,
our
state
constitution
requires
a
far
stricter
separation
of
church
and
state
which
i
have
described
in
our
reply
brief
as
an
anvil-like
hint
of
what
they
were
going
to
do
if
they
actually
reached
the
state
constitutional
issue.
mr.
michael
p.
farris
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
p.
farris
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but,
under
the
rescue
army
criteria
of
is
there
ambiguity,
is
there
uncertainty,
we
would
suggest
there
is
no
uncertainty
in
the
state
supreme
court's
position
on
this.
mr.
michael
p.
farris
that
is
the
state
supreme
court's--
mr.
michael
p.
farris
--i
think
that
that--
mr.
michael
p.
farris
--well,
i
would
not
characterize
it
as
state
policy,
your
honor.
state
policy,
in
my
view,
is
made
by
the
legislature.
policy
is
not
made
by
the
courts.
the
courts
are
there
to
interpret
the
law,
not
to
make
policy.
so,
in
my
theory
of
the
case,
there
is
a
difference
between
policy
and
constitutional
adjudication.
mr.
michael
p.
farris
i
don't
know
of
any
such
policy,
your
honor.
in
fact,
we
cite
in
our
opening
brief
another
program
of
higher
education
that
was
granting
aid
to
all
private
schools
in
the
state
of
washington,
private
college
students,
and
in
there
there
was
an
exclusion
for
those
pursuing
a
theological
course
of
study.
and,
it
is
our
argument
that
if
the
state
legislature
wants
to
exclude
these
kinds
of
people
it
knows
how
to
do
it
and
it
has
done
so
in
the
past.
and,
the
argument
about
state
policy,
i
think,
is
made
difficult
because
the
state
constitutional
provisions
have
been
interpreted
to
prohibit
aid
of
any
kind
to
religious
colleges
at
all.
mr.
michael
p.
farris
my
understanding
of
what
constitutes
state
policy
for
constitutional
purposes--
mr.
michael
p.
farris
--well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
there
is
a
broad
thing
that
we
can
call
state
policy.
we
have
state
statutes
and
we
have
the
state
constitution
and
we
have
court
interpretations.
i
think
that
the
policy
analysis
ascribes
to...
must
be
penned
upon
some
legal
document,
some
legal
process,
and
i
don't
see
one
here.
mr.
michael
p.
farris
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
p.
farris
and,
that
is
also
correct,
your
honor.
we
think
that
they
were
obviously
in
error.
briefly,
in
the
free
exercise
arguments
raised
by
respondent,
they
argued
that
this
is
a
case
like
harris
versus
mcrae
and
this
court
should
not
find
against
the
legislative
will.
as
we
have
argued
already,
we
are
not
asking
this
court
to
override
the
legislative
will.
in
fact,
both
congress
and
the
state
of
washington's
legislature
where
the
source
in
this
case
have
said
it
is
okay
for
ministerial
students
to
participate.
we
think
this
case
is
indistinguishable
from
mcdaniel,
thomas,
sherbert,
and
the
other
cases
of
this
court
and
would
ask
this
court
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
court
below.
mr.
michael
p.
farris
yes.
in
response
to
the
arguments
raised
by
the
respondent
in
this
case,
i
would
point
out,
first
of
all,
that
the
g.i.
bill,
unlike
the
contentions
of
the
respondent,
is
concerned
with
the
career
choice
selected
by
the
recipients
of
that
bill.
as
we
pointed
out
in
footnote
20
of
our
opening
brief,
38
u.s.c.,
section
1673,
lists
a
number
of
courses
of
study
in
career
objectives
which
are
excluded
from
the
bill's
coverage,
including
any
course
in
bartending,
personality
development,
sales
courses,
etcetera,
are
types
of
courses
that
the
g.i.
bill
excludes.
so,
there
is
concern
there
by
the
congress,
just
as
there
is
concern
by
the
state
legislature,
that
people
will
pursue
career
choices
that
will
lead
to
legitimate
kinds
of
employment.
also
to
answer
the
chief
justice's
inquiry,
the
solicitor's
brief
points
out
in
footnote
3
that
inland
empire
school
of
the
bible
is
an
eligible
institution
for
people
to
enroll
in
the
g.i.
bill.
turning
to
the
meat
of
the
respondent's
argument,
they
have
argued
based
on
speculation,
as
we
suggested
in
our
opening
argument,
about
various
kinds
of
things
that
might
happen,
could
have
happened,
might
happen
under
the
career
counseling
that
takes
place,
but
they
did
not
put
any
kind
of
this
evidence
in
the
record
below.
if
they
thought
the
federal
constitution
or
the
federal
statutes
or
the
federal
regulations
gave
them
a
source
of
defense
of
this
claim,
they
could
have
and
should
have,
we
would
submit,
put
the
evidence
in
the
record
below
and
their
failure
to
put
that
evidence
in
should
not
be
charged
to
our
account
at
this
point.
we
think
this
case
should
be
decided
on
the
record
and
it
should
not
be
sent
back
for
development
of
more
facts,
and,
moreover,
it
should
not
be
decided
at
all
on
speculation
as
engaged
in
by
respondent.
mr.
michael
p.
farris
i
suppose
not,
your
honor,
but
i
think
if
this
court
held
we
were
correct
on
the
free
exercise
clause
issue,
that
would
foreclose
the
other
inquiry
in
all
likelihood.
mr.
michael
p.
farris
it
is
our
desire
that
this
court
would
and
we
think--
mr.
michael
p.
farris
--it
is
not
required
absolutely,
but
if
there
is
no
prudential
consideration
of
the
rescue
army
type
of
criteria
for
failing
to
do
so,
we
would
urge
this
court
to
decide
the
free
exercise
clause
issue.
mr.
michael
p.
farris
that
would
be
correct,
your
honor.
the
state,
we
would
say,
importantly
fails
to
give
us
any
distinctions
between
the
kind
of
approval
process
that
they
speculate
about
here
and
the
approval
process
that
is
inherent
in
a
building
permit
project
by
a
church.
and,
we
think
that
is
a
fatal
error
on
their
part.
finally,
we
would
turn
to
the
issue
of
the
state
policy,
the
term
that
has
been
used
this
morning.
we
would
contend
that
there
is
no
clear-cut
state
policy
that
prohibits
the
kind
of
aid
that
is
in
question.
the
state
decisions
before
of
weiss
versus
bruno
which
they
rely
on
and
which
the
state
supreme
court
relied
on
said
that
you
couldn't
go
to
a
religious
college
for
any
purpose
using
state
monies.
but,
today
the
attorney
general
has
conceded
that
a
blind
student
can
go
to
inland
empire
school
of
the
bible
or
other
religious
colleges
as
long
as
he
wants
to
have
a
secular
career
choice.
where
is
the
clearcut
source
of
the
state
policy
in
such
a
circumstance?
mr.
michael
p.
farris
thank
you,
your
honor.
