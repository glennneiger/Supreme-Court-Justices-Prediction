we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
witters
against
the
washington
department
of
services
for
the
blind.
mr.
farris,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
see.
well,
was
he
an
undergraduate
or
a
graduate
student?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
does
the
social
security...
would
you
explain
that?
how
does
that
get
in
the
picture?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
could
use
it
to
start
a
filling
station
too
if
they
wanted,
couldn't
they?
there
is
no
limit
on
what
they
could
do.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
veterans'
benefits
after
the
various
wars
we
have
been
in?
are
there
any
limitations
placed
by
congress
on
what
studies
the
veterans
could
pursue?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
also
possible
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
thought
there
was
so
little
to
the
argument
that
it
didn't
deserve
any
comment
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
malone?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
which
constitution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
malone,
is
it
our
function
to
try
to
construe
the
state
constitution
here
when
the
supreme
court
did
not--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
malone,
what
would
you
say
about
a
foundation
that
was
created
to
grant
scholarships,
only
one
purpose
to
grant
scholarships
to
students
studying
for
the
priesthood
of
the
roman
catholic
church.
would
it
be
entitled
to
501(c)(3),
if
that
is
the
right
section,
exemption
from--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--it
wouldn't
make
any
difference.
it
would
be
obvious
then
that
if
it
were
for
all
religions
it
would
be
equally
good.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that
is
like
the
tax
case
in
the
new
york
situation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
it
not
also
comparable
to
the
general
rule
which
has
been
laid
down
that
churches
are
not
to
be
taxed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
501(c)(3)
merely
implements
that--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
farris?
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
course,
if
it
went
back
to
the
state
supreme
court
and
the
state
supreme
court
went
against
you,
conceivably
you
might
be
up
on
a
free
exercise
claim
or
you
might
try
to
get
up
on
a
free
exercise
claim
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired
now,
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
