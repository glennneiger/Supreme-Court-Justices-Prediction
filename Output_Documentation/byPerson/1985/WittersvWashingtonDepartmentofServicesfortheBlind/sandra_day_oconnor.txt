justice

is
he
pursuing
some
other
educational
degree
at
the
moment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
farris,
do
you
concede
that
the
state
of
washington
could,
if
they
chose,
have
a
vocational
rehabilitation
program
which
expressly
excludes
any
educational
funding
for
the
ministry?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
it
would
be
valid
under
the
establishment
clause
for
the
state
to
have
such
an
express
provision?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
it
be
valid
under
the
free
exercise
clause?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
it
is
your
position
that
if
the
state
wants
to
fund
educational
aid
for
students,
it
must
include
educational
aid
for
religious
students
of
study.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
should
it
matter
what
code
the
legislature
enacts
it
under
for
a
constitutional
inquiry?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
just
seems
to
me
that
your
argument
would
lead
inevitably
to
conclude
that
a
state
could
not
withhold
funding
for
religious
education
at
any
level
and
in
any
program.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
farris,
does
mr.
witters
urge
that
his
religious
beliefs
and
practices
require
him
to
study
theology?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and,
in
fact,
if
it
is
correct
that
the
state
constitution
prohibits
this
kind
of
state
aid,
then
we
do
have
the
case
that
i
posed
to
you
and
justice
white
posed
to
you
in
the
question.
we
would
have
a
situation
where
the
state
says
you
can't
provide
this
kind
of
aid
in
a
vocational
rehabilitation
or
any
other
kind
of
a
program.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
that
the
whole
picture?
are
there
not
state
administrative
regulations
in
this
very
program
that
make
it
clear
that
aid
will
not
be
furnished,
payments
won't
be
made
to
pay
for
religious
study?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there
certainly
is
no
ambiguity
or
uncertainty
about
the
state's
policy
as
interpreted
by
the
state's
highest
court
and
the
state's
policy
is
not
to
fund
this
kind
of
education.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
we
don't
have
to
be
concerned
about
what
the
state
constitution
says
because,
as
a
matter
of
state
policy
as
interpreted
by
the
state
court,
they
don't
fund
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and,
you
take
the
position
that
the
free
exercise
clause
of
the
federal
constitution
requires
them
to
fund
it
against
their
will.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
mr.
malone,
under
your
version,
the
applicable
washington
law,
would
it
be
perfectly
all
right
to
have
funded
mr.
witters'
education
at
inland
school
if
he
wanted
to
study
history,
for
example?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
he
could
do
that
in
a
religious
school?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and,
it
would
be
all
right
under
the
state
constitution
as
well
as
the
federal
to
pay
the
tuition.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
malone,
are
you
asking
that
we
focus
on
the
fact
that
in
order
to
get
the
aid
mr.
witters
must
subject
himself
to
state
regulation,
is
that
your
concern,
or
is
it
that
it
advances
religion
in
your
view
because
mr.
witters
wants
to
become
a
minister?
which
is
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
the
court
normally
looks
at
the
program
as
a
whole
rather
than
focusing
on
the
individual
receiving
the
aid
in
these
cases?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
this
court
generally
has
given
a
broader
focus
to
the
inquiry
rather
than
just
looking
to
the
individual?
for
example,
suppose
the
state
has
a
welfare
program
and
hands
out
welfare
money
to
someone
who
tells
you
i
am
going
to
give
part
of
this
money
to
the
church
on
sunday.
is
that
okay?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
all
depends
on
the
lens
with
which
you
view
it.
if
you
look
at
the
whole
program
and
say
what
we
have
here
is
educational
funding
for
vocational
rehabilitation,
then
it
isn't
religious-specific.
if
you
focus
just
on
mr.
witters,
it
is.
the
same
in
sherbert,
the
same
in
thomas.
it
depends
on
how
you
look
at
it.
