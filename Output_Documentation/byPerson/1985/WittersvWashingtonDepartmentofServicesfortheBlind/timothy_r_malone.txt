mr.
timothy
r.
malone
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
wish
to
address
four
points.
first,
i
wish
to
discuss
why
this
particular
vocational
rehabilitation
program
is
not
like
the
g.i.
bill
or,
and
this
is
saying
the
same
thing,
why
it
is
not
like
the
program
involved
in
mueller
versus
allen
and
i
wish
to
discuss
why
this
difference
is
critical
constitutionally.
second,
i
wish
to
touch
on
this
question
that
has
been
referred
to
in
counsel's
argument
as
to
the
statutory
source
of
the
federal
funding
and
supposed
deficiencies
of
the
record
on
this
question,
because
that
bears
upon
whether
or
not
i
should
have
been
making
my
first
point
at
all.
thirdly,
i
wish
to
examine
how
this
question
of
our
submission
differs
from
that
of
the
court
below
and
what
difference,
if
any,
it
makes.
and,
fourthly,
i
wish
to
step
back
and
ask
what
role
does
the
free
exercise
clause
play
in
all
of
this?
i
think
by
now
it
is
apparent
that
it
is
important
indeed
and
that
the
petitioner
is
trying
to
use
the
free
exercise
clause
not
only
to
invalidate
the
religion
clauses
of
our
state
constitution,
but
also
to
have
the
free
exercise
clause
swallow
up
a
large
part,
i
would
suggest,
of
the
establishment
clause
jurisprudence
of
this
court
as
well.
before
turning
to
our
first
point
though,
i
want
to
take
up
this
question
of
state
policy.
we
have
two
constitutional
provisions
that
are
relevant
in
this
case.
mr.
timothy
r.
malone
the
state
constitution.
article
i,
section
11,
says
no
public
money
shall
be
applied
to
any
religious
instruction.
article
ix,
section
4,
says
all
schools
maintained
or
supported,
wholly
or
in
part
by
public
funds,
shall
be
ever
free
from
sectarian
control.
in
weiss
versus
bruno,
a
decision
of
our
state
supreme
court,
which
was
referred
to
in
the
decision
below
in
this
very
case,
the
court
made
it
clear
that
it
takes...
under
those
religion
clauses
the
funding
restrictions
for
religious
instruction
for
church-affiliated
schools
are
even
more
strict
than
those
established
by
this
court
under
the
establishment
clause.
now,
that
is
the
source
of
the
policy
that
we
are
talking
about.
that
policy--
mr.
timothy
r.
malone
--the
state
constitution.
now,
that
policy
in
the
state
constitution
was
embodied
in
a
written
policy
statement
applicable
to
this
particular
program
which
said
we
cannot
fund
ministerial
students.
but,
justice
rehnquist
is
absolutely
right.
that
policy
is
embodied
right
in
the
constitution.
secondly,
i
would
suggest
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
state
statutes
involving
this
program
which
are
contrary
to
that
policy.
the
state
statutes
or
the
state
statute
which
we
used
have...
it
was
changed
somewhat
in
1983...
said
the
commission
for
the
blind
may
maintain
or
cause
to
be
maintained
a
program
of
services
to
assist
visually
handicapped
people.
under
such
program
the
commission
may
provide
for
special
education
or
training
in
professions,
businesses,
etcetera.
the
new
statute
for
all
practical
purposes
is
quite
similar
in
this
respect,
that
it
is
discretionary.
i
do
not
read
in
there
a
legislative
determination
that,
boy,
we
want
to
fund
ministerial
training.
so,
again,
we
have
the
basic
policy
established
in
our
constitution
which
the
petitioner
wishes
to
have
invalidated
and
we
do
not
have
a
clear
legislative
declaration
that
it
wants
to
override
that
policy.
mr.
timothy
r.
malone
i
am
not
saying
the
statute
doesn't
authorize
it.
i
am
saying
the
statute
does
not...
that
the
statute
is
ambiguous
and
the
statute
shows
the
legislature
did
not
specifically
address
the
question,
do
we
fund
ministerial
training
or
don't
we?
mr.
timothy
r.
malone
let
me
put
it
this
way.
they
certainly
took
the
position
that
it
was
okay
for
the
department
of
services
to
the
blind
to
put
blind
people
through
the
program,
including
the
program
of
ministerial
training
unless
there
was
a
constitutional
objection
to
it,
yes.
with
that,
i
would
like
to--
mr.
timothy
r.
malone
--no.
all
i
am
trying...
mr.
justice
burger,
absolutely
not.
i
am
trying
to
point
out
what
the
source
of
this
state
policy
is
and
how
it
goes
right
back
to
our
constitution.
and,
even
more
importantly,
i--
mr.
timothy
r.
malone
--if
he
wanted
to
study
solely
history,
yes.
mr.
timothy
r.
malone
yes.
indeed--
mr.
timothy
r.
malone
--not
certainly
the
federal,
probably
the
state
at
least
if
he
wants
to
be
a
historian,
if
he
wants
that
to
be
his
profession.
i
would
like
to
discuss
then
why
this
vocational
rehabilitation
program
is
simply
not
like
the
g.i.
bill
and
why
that
difference
is
constitutionally
critical.
now,
what
i
might
call
the
normal
rule
seems
to
be
that
in
cases
such
as
this
one
must
separate
out
the
secular
from
the
sectarian
and
fund
only
the
secular,
not
the
sectarian.
however,
there
is
apparently
an
exception,
what
you
might
call
the
delivery
system,
which
embodies
a
hands-off,
passive
role
on
the
part
of
the
government,
and
if
the
program
in
terms
of
beneficiaries
is
sufficiently
broad-based,
apparently
one
does
not
need
to
make
this
separation.
i
would
suggest
that
is
the
rationale
which
was
applied
in
mueller.
i
would
suggest
that
that
is
the
rationale
which
would
justify
the
application
of
the
g.i.
bill
to
ministerial
training.
now,
there
is,
of
course,
in
this
case
no
effort
whatsoever
to
make
any
such
separation.
so,
the
effort
must
be
to
come
within
what
we
might
call
the
mueller
g.i.
bill
exception.
the
solicitor
general
and
the
petitioner
in
his
opening
brief
argued
exactly
that.
this
program
was
just
like
the
g.i.
bill
and
the
mueller
rationale
applied.
now,
we
say
that
it
is
not
like
the
g.i.
bill.
the
mueller
rationale
does
not
apply.
let
me
illustrate
in
terms
of
the
g.i.
bill
itself.
under
the
g.i.
bill
the
government
really
just
cares
that
the
veteran
is
in
an
accredited
school
and
that
is
it.
the
specific
school
that
he
goes
to,
as
long
as
it
is
accredited...
and
by
the
way,
the
federal
government
doesn't
even
do
the
accreditation.
the
specific
school
is
of
no
concern
to
the
government.
what
courses
he
takes
are
of
no
concern
to
the
government.
whether
the
student
has
made
any
sort
of
career
source
is
of
no
concern
to
the
government.
he
could
take
sanskrit
and
spend
the
rest
of
his
time
wandering
around
in
india,
say,
and
that
is
of
no
concern
to
the
government
at
all.
but,
let's
change
things.
let's
suppose
that
the
government
amended
the
g.i.
bill
and
said
you
have
to
make
a
career
choice
now
and
we
have
to
approve
that
career
choice.
in
light
of
that
career
choice,
we
also
have
to
approve
the
school
and
the
courses
you
want
to
select
to
make
sure
that
it
all
fits.
now,
let's
set
aside
for
the
moment
the
question
of
how
the
government
goes
about
making
those
decisions,
what
criteria
to
use
to
approve
or
not
approve
those
choices.
the
mere
fact
of
need
for
approval,
it
seems
to
me,
changes
the
delivery
system,
if
you
will,
and
takes
the
program
out
of
the
mueller
rationale,
the
mueller
g.
i.
bill
exception,
and
back
into
the
normal
rule
of
leading,
of
having
to
bring
about
that
submission.
and,
i
suggest
that
the
vocational
rehabilitation
program
we
have
here
is
exactly
like
that
new
g.i.
bill
and,
therefore,
it
cannot
fall
within
the
mueller
rationale,
the
mueller
exception,
and
the
normal
rule
that
you
have
to
make
the
separation.
mr.
timothy
r.
malone
both.
i
focus
on
both,
so
to
speak,
what
is
delivered,
what
the
state
is
buying,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
timothy
r.
malone
it
is
precisely...
yes.
it
is
precisely
there
that
we
part
company
somewhat
with
the
court
below.
mr.
timothy
r.
malone
absolutely...
of
course,
yes.
absolutely
no
problem
there.
but,
what
is
the
difference
from
that
situation
and
the
situation
here?
the
situation
you
have
here
is,
i
suggest,
this:
mr.
witters
wants
to
the
state
to
buy
for
him
ministerial
training.
now,
that
is
not
a
good
start
under
the
free
exercise
clause,
and,
indeed,
our
state
supreme
court
would
say
that
fact
in
and
of
itself
is
fatal.
we
suggest,
though
it
is
not
a
good
start,
it
is
not
the
end
of
the
inquiry,
precisely,
justice
o'connor,
because
of
the
point
you
just
raised.
you
have
to
look
not
only
at
what
is
provided,
what
is
delivered,
you
have
to
look
at
the
nature
of
the
delivery
system,
at
the
breadth
of
the
types
of
beneficiaries,
the
overall
scope
of
the
program,
and
also
in
looking
at
the
overall
program
you
also
have
to
look
at
the
role
of
the
state
in
that
program
in
order
to
see
whether
or
not
it
embodies
a
hands-off
policy,
such
as
i
suggest
you
had
in
mueller,
or
whether
it...
and,
such
as
i
suggest
you
also
have
in
the
g.i.
bill.
our
basic
submission
is
that
if
you
do
not
have
that
hands-off
policy,
then
you
are
back
under
the
normal
rule.
you
have
to
separate
out
the
religious
and
the
secular.
mr.
timothy
r.
malone
i
believe
that
it
was.
mr.
timothy
r.
malone
i
believe
he
could
have
as
i
understand
the
g.i.
bill.
and,
again,
the
reason
we
say
he
can't
use
our
money
for
that
or
he
can't
use
this
program
for
that
is
because
of
the
difference
in
the
delivery
system
between
the
g.i.
bill
and
this
program.
now,
the
petitioner
says
that
this
question
of
state
involvement
under
this
program
is
being
exaggerated
and
that
we
can
make
approval
decisions
on
the
basis
of
objective
criterion
and
that
somehow
this
solves
the
problem.
well,
i
suggest
that
it
does
not
solve
the
problem
at
all.
the
state
has
to
approve,
first
of
all,
the
career
choice.
i
think
we
are
all
agreed
on
that.
let's
see
how
objective
criteria
might
work
in
that
respect.
suppose
again,
on
the
basis
of
objective
criteria,
say
department
of
labor
data,
the
episcopal
church,
we
find,
has
a
surplus
of
priests
and
the
catholic
church
has
a
shortage
or
there
is
a
great
need
for
lutheran
ministers
but
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
much
need
at
all
for
denominational
ministers.
now,
the
vocational
educational
counselor
then,
right
at
the
start,
is
going
to
have
to
say,
i
am
sorry,
i
can't
help
you
if
you
want
to
be
episcopalian,
if
you
want
to
be
an
episcopal
priest,
or
a
non-denomination
minister,
but
if
you
want
to
be
a
lutheran
minister
or
a
catholic
priest,
yes.
on
the
basis
of
these
objective
criteria,
i
can
help
you.
suppose
one
particular
seminary
or
bible
college
has
a
great
success
rate
in
its
placement
of
its
graduates
and
suppose
another
one
has
a
low
success
rate.
so,
the
voc/rehab
counselor
has
to
say
to
the
student,
though
you
really
want
to
go
to
seminary
x.
i
am
sorry,
if
you
want
to
be
a
minister
or
priest,
you
have
to
go
to
seminary
y.
suppose
we
had
something
like
an
objective
test,
say,
put
out
by
educational
testing
service
up
in
princeton,
similar
to
the
lsat
for
ministerial
students.
counselor
or
at
least
some
state
official
is
going
to
have
to
decide
on
a
cut-off
point
as
to
who,
you
know,
passes
and
who
flunks.
and,
he
is
going
to
have
to
say
to
one
student,
okay,
we
will
pay
for
your
ministerial
training
and
he
is
going
to
have
to
say
to
another,
we
won't
pay
for
yours.
the
test
indicates
to
us
you
are
too
low,
you
are
not
going
to
be
a
success,
either
in
school
or
you
are
not
going
to
be
a
success
in
the
ministry.
now,
i
think
that...
i
dare
say
that
the
likelihood
of
these
things
happening
even
under
the
so-called
objective
criteria
which
the
petitioner
would
have
you
rely
on,
it
seems
to
me
the
likelihood
of
these
things
happening
should
be
very
disturbing,
whether
we
focus
on
either
the
second
or
the
third
prong
of
the
lemon
test.
mr.
timothy
r.
malone
in
terms
of
the
actual
operation--
well,
let
me
put
it
another
way.
we
do
know
that
this
is
80
percent
federally
funded.
the
record
does
not
say
where
that
federal
funding
comes
from.
the
solicitor
general
at
page...
i
forget
which
page...
but,
in
footnote
11
it
says
it
is
the
1973
rehabilitation
act.
mr.
timothy
r.
malone
yes
and
no
and
let
me
explain
that
answer.
through
the
trial
court
level
and,
indeed,
through
the
argument
before
the
state
supreme
court
the
only
thing
we
were
talking
about
were
the
state
constitutional
provisions
that
i
mentioned
at
the
beginning
of
my
argument.
so,
there
was
no
need
to
focus
at
all
upon
the
establishment
clause
problem
at
all
or
the
entanglement
problem
in
particular.
mr.
timothy
r.
malone
certainly.
were
this
issue,
justice--
mr.
timothy
r.
malone
--yes.
mr.
timothy
r.
malone
certainly,
certainly,
mr.
justice
stevens.
on
the
one
hand,
i
realize
the
difficulties
which
come
from
just
relying
upon
the
federal
regulations,
the
federal
statutes,
the
federal
regulations.
i
understand
those
difficulties.
mr.
timothy
r.
malone
no,
no.
and,
let
me
put
to
you
another
case.
mr.
timothy
r.
malone
one,
would
he
have
to
be
denied
unemployment
compensation
under
the
establishment
clause?
no.
would
he
be
under
the
religion
provisions
of
our
state
constitution?
i
would
suggest
no,
which
raises
another
question.
let's
suppose,
justice
stevens...
let's
suppose
that
he
is
a
minister
and
he
happens
to
be
going
blind
and
so
he
needs
to
learn
braille.
now,
i
am
touching
upon
the
free
exercise
issue
and,
suppose
he
comes
to
the
department
of
services
for
the
blind
and
says
i
am
not
going
to
be
able
to
perform
my
functions
as
a
minister
unless
i
get
this
training
in
braille,
will
you
give
it
to
me?
and,
my
answer
would
be
the
free
exercise
clause
would
require
that
we
give
it
to
him.
the
establishment
clause
would
not
prohibit
it,
nor
would
the
religion
clauses
of
our
state
constitution.
why?
because
braille
is
not
religion-specific.
that
is
to
say
braille
is
something
which
somebody
could
well
want
for
purposes
having
nothing
to
do
with
religion.
now,
what
i
am
suggesting,
and
this
gets
back
to
justice
o'connor's
question
as
to
the
scope
of
the
free
exercise
clause
here,
it
seems
to
me
that
under
such
cases
as
mcdaniel
v.
paty
and
sherbert
versus
verner,
what
was
involved
there
were
benefits
or
rights
or
whatever
that
were
not
religion-specific.
what
mr.
witters
wants
here
is
to
use
the
free
exercise
clause
to
require
the
state
to
give
him
something
that
is
religion-specific.
mcdaniel
v.
paty
does
not
require
that.
mr.
timothy
r.
malone
i
am
using
the
religion-specific/not
religion-specific
distinction,
justice
o'connor,
as
a
distinction
which
should
be
embodied
in
applying
the
free
exercise
clause.
when
you
get
to
the
establishment
clause
question,
i
suggest
that,
indeed,
the
question
is
how
do
you
look
to
it
and
i
suggest
that
the
critical
question
is
under
what
circumstances
do
you
have
to
make
this
separation
which
clearly
is
not
being
made
here.
i
am
suggesting
that
this
case
does
not
present
the
circumstances
under
which
you
have
the
g.i.
bill
or
the
mueller
type
exception.
i
would
suggest
then
that
these
objective
criteria
are
going
to
produce
very
strange
results
which
i
should
suggest
this
court
should
find
very
disturbing
under
the
establishment
clause.
now,
this
counselor
that
i
was
talking
about
quite
possibly
might
find
some
way
out
of
this,
might
say,
well,
i
am
getting
over
my
head.
mr.
timothy
r.
malone
none
of
what
i
am
discussing
now
was
brought
out
at
those
administrative
proceedings,
because
again,
justice
rehnquist,
what
we
were
focusing
on
was
at
that
stage
all
the
way
up
until
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington
issued
its
opinion,
all
we
were
focusing
on
were
the
state
religion
clauses.
for
my
discussion
here
as
to
entanglement,
i
am
relying
upon
the
federal
regulations
and
the
state
regulations
which
pretty
much
track
this.
mr.
timothy
r.
malone
yes,
and
i
believe
that
it
would,
and
i
believe
that
it
would
under
the
reasoning
of
this
court
in
walz.
the
answer
would
be
yes.
mr.
timothy
r.
malone
yes.
i
see
no
problem
with
501(c)(3),
but
again,
501(c)(3)
involves
a
hands-off
delivery
system
as
did
the
tax
deduction...
i
am
sorry.
mr.
timothy
r.
malone
no,
the
tax
case
in
mueller.
mr.
timothy
r.
malone
i
am
referring
to
mueller
when
i
say
the
501(c)(3)
is
like
the--
mr.
timothy
r.
malone
--oh,
walz
as
well,
yes.
mr.
timothy
r.
malone
yes.
i
could
justify
501(c)(3),
mr.
chief
justice,
both
under
the
type
of
mueller
rationale
and
under
the
walz
rationale,
which
i
think
are
quite
similar.
to
get
back
to
my
counselor
who
is
worried
about
the
types
of
results
that
would
come
out
under
these
so-called
objective
criteria,
that
counselor
might
well
say,
well,
i
am
over
my
head,
i
don't
know
anything
about
this,
and
i
am
in
an
area
that
is
religiously
sensitive,
i
am
going
to
get
out
of
it,
i
am
going
to
rely
on
the
experts.
i
will
let
them
tell
me
whether
or
not
this
person
has
the
aptitudes
for
the
ministry,
whether
this
school
is
the
best
school
for
this
type
of
ministry,
so
on
and
so
forth.
but,
i
would
suggest
who
are
those
experts?
those
experts
have
to
be
church
and
seminary
or
bible
school
officials
themselves.
so,
once
our
counselor
decides
to
do
that,
then
it
seems
to
me
you
walk
right
into
a
grendel's
den
type
of
problem.
you
have
a
type
of
delegation.
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
however
much
you
try,
given
the
federal
regulations
and
the
state
regulations
that
govern
this
program,
there
is
no
way
to
get
out
of
this
swamp.
there
is
no
way
to
get
out
of
this
entanglement.
with
respect
to
the
free
exercise
clause
issue,
again,
i
would
just
emphasize
that
a
state
should
have
the
option
under
this
court's
jurisprudence
to
say
we
do
not
want
to
fund
ministerial
students.
that
is
what
we
have
said
in
the
religion
clauses
of
our
state
constitution.
and,
i
suggest
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
free
exercise
clause
decisions
of
this
court
which
invalidate
those
decisions
of
the
state
of
washington
as
embodied
in
their
constitution.
thank
you.
