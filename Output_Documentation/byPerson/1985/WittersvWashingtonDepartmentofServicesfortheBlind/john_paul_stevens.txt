paul

mr.
farris,
is
that
a
fair
statement,
what
they
did?
they
said
that
because
they
relied
upon
the
effect
of
the
second
prong
they
didn't
have
to
reach
the
third.
that
is
all
they
said.
they
didn't
have
to
reach
the
entanglement
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
unnecessary
for
us
to
attempt...
i
guess
they
said
a
strained
analysis
of
the
entanglement
effect,
but
they
had
already
decided
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
guess
justice
utter's
dissent
rejected
the
entanglement
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
farris,
may
i
just
review
one
thing
with
you?
is
it
not
correct
that
if
we
should
agree
with
you
on
the
establishment
clause
issue
as
a
federal
constitutional
matter
and
if
we
should
be
in
doubt
as
to
what
the
state
might
do
with
its
own
constitution,
then
we
could
remand
without
ever
reaching
the
free
exercise
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
at
least
two
members
of
the
state
supreme
court
thought
it
did
not
violate
the
state
constitution,
is
that
not
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and,
they
actually
addressed
the
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
is
a
lot
of
difference
between
anvil-like
hints
when
you
misinterpret
the
federal
constitution
and
actually
deciding
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
not
suggesting
they
did
misinterpret
it,
but
it
is
a
little
different.
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
malone,
what
is
there
in
the
record
to
tell
us
anything
about
the
likelihood
that
any
of
these
things
might
happen?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
you,
at
the
trial
level
in
this
case,
have
an
adequate
opportunity
to
present
evidence
of
this
kind
of
problem
that
might
develop
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
whether
you
elected
to
rely
on
the
federal
constitution
in
defending
your
opponent's
claim
was
certainly
within
your
control,
not
within
your
adversary's.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
one
other
question.
supposing,
as
has
been
suggested,
that
we
thought
there
was
no
merit
to
the
primary
effects
defense,
but
maybe
there
is
problem
with
the
entanglement
as
you
argue
today.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and,
they
haven't
decided
it
and
say
we
send
it
back
and
decide
the
entanglement
issue.
couldn't
you
then
develop
the
record
that
would
support
this
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
hypotheticals
have
triggered
a
question
in
my
mind
i
would
like
to
put
to
you
if
i
may.
you
talked
about
employment
opportunities
in
different
denominations.
supposing
you
had
an
unemployed
assistant
pastor
of
the
lutheran
church
or
something
and
he
went
in
for
unemployment
compensation.
would
he
be
denied
unemployment
compensation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
he
have
to
prove
that
he
had
really
been
a
minister
and
that
he
was
eligible
and
all
that
sort
of
stuff?
