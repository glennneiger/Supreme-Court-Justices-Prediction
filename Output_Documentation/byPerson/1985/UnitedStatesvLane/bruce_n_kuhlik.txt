mr.
bruce
neil
kuhlik
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
defendants
in
this
case
were
each
charged
in
five
counts
of
a
six-count
indictment
alleging
mail
fraud,
conspiracy,
and
perjury
in
connection
with
three
arson
for
profit
schemes.
after
a
joint
jury
trial,
each
defendant
was
convicted
on
every
count
in
which
he
was
charged.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
one
of
the
counts
was
improperly
joined
with
the
other
five.
it
reversed
the
convictions
and
remanded
for
new
trials
on
all
counts
without
determining
whether
either
defendant
was
prejudiced
in
any
respect
by
the
misjoinder.
two
questions
are
before
the
court,
first,
whether
misjoinder
is
an
exception
to
the
rule
that
reviewing
courts
have
a
duty
to
determine
whether
any
error
at
trial
was
harmless,
and
second,
whether
the
evidence
was
sufficient
to
support
the
defendant's
convictions
for
mail
fraud
in
connection
with
their
arson
of
a
duplex.
we
think
it
is
plain
that
misjoinder,
which
is
a
comparatively
common
garden
variety
violation
of
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure
does
not
fit
within
the
extremely
narrow
category
of
errors
that
are
excepted
from
harmless
error
inquiry.
we
also
submit
that
it
is
equally
clear
that
the
mailing
of
insurance
forms
and
fabricated
invoices
to
the
defrauded
insurance
company
furthered
the
defendants'
scheme
to
defraud
within
the
meaning
of
the
mail
fraud
statute.
the
defendants,
j.c.
and
dennis
lane,
are
father
and
son.
count
1
of
the
indictment
charged
j.c.
lane
alone
with
the
1979
arson
of
his
failing
restaurant
business.
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
supporting
this
count
is
undisputed.
counts
2
through
4
charged
both
defendants
with
mail
fraud
in
connection
with
the
arson
of
a
duplex
building
that
they
had
purchased
for
$500
and
insured
for
$35,000.
the
building
was
burned
pursuant
to
their
direction
in
early
may
of
1980.
shortly
thereafter,
dennis
lane
submitted
a
proof
of
loss
form
to
the
insurance
adjuster
which
stated
quite
fraudulently
that
he
had
played
no
part
in
the
fire
and
was
making
no
attempt
to
deceive
the
insurance
company.
at
the
same
time,
he
received
a
draft
payment
of
$7,000
with
which
to
begin
repair
work
on
the
building.
the
insurance
adjuster
later
mailed
that
proof
of
loss
form
to
the
insurance
company
headquarters
and
it
was
this
mailing
that
was
charged
in
count
2
of
the
indictment.
as
the
summer
of
1980
progressed,
the
insurance
company
made
additional
payments
totalling
$5,000
to
the
lanes
with
which
to
continue
repairs,
and
the
defendants
continued
to
submit
fraudulent
forms
to
the
insurance
adjuster.
additional
forms
were
mailed
by
the
adjuster
to
the
company
headquarters
in
august
of
1980.
it
was
this
mailing
that
was
charged
in
count
3.
finally,
the
insurance
company
settled
the
claim
completely
with
a
payment
of
$12,250
on
september
16th
of
1980.
two
days
later,
the
insurance
adjuster
mailed
fraudulent
invoices
that
the
defendants
had
fabricated
to
support
their
repair
claim
to
the
company.
it
was
this
final
mailing
on
september
18th
of
1980
that
was
charged
in
count
4.
these
are
the
counts
whose
sufficiency
is
before
the
court.
count
5
charged
both
defendants
with
conspiracy
to
commit
mail
fraud
in
connection
with
their
planned
arson
of
a
phony
flower
shop,
and
count
6
charged
dennis
lane
alone
with
perjury
before
a
grand
jury
that
was
investigating
the
flower
shop
scheme.
the
defendants
were
tried
jointly.
the
trial
lasted
six
days.
the
government
produced
over
two
dozen
witnesses
and
over
100
exhibits.
the
defendants
countered
chiefly
by
character
witnesses
and
dennis
lane's
denials
that
he
had
done
anything
wrong.
the
jury
convicted
on
all
counts.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
count
1,
which
charged
j.c.
lane
alone
with
the
restaurant
arson,
was
improperly
joined
the
other
five
counts
under
rule
8(b)
of
the
criminal
rules.
the
court
refused
to
determine
whether
any...
either
of
the
defendants
was
prejudiced
in
any
respect
by
this
error,
holding
only
that
in
its
circuit
misjoinder
was
prejudicial
per
se,
and
not
subject
to
harmless
error
inquiry.
the
court
of
appeals
also
held
that
the
evidence
was
sufficient
to
support
the
mail
fraud
convictions
in
connection
with
the
duplex,
holding
that
the
mailings
of
the
fraudulent
proof
of
loss
forms
and
repair
invoices
helped
to
hide
the
defendants'
fraud
and
served
to
help
them
obtain
and
retain
the
proceeds
of
their
fraud,
but
the
court
did
remand
for
a
new
trial
on
all
counts.
turning
first
to
the
harmless
error
issue,
we
think
it
is...
or
this
court
has
consistently
made
it
clear
that
reviewing
courts
have
a
duty
under
rule
52(a)
of
the
criminal
rules
and
28
usc
2111
to
determine
the
harmlessness
or
prejudicial
effect
of
any
error
at
trial
before
predicating
a
reversal
on
such
an
error.
this
rule
serves
important
purposes--
mr.
bruce
neil
kuhlik
--yes.
mr.
bruce
neil
kuhlik
our
position
is
not
that
joinder
under
rule
8
is
not
a
substantial
right.
our
position
is
that
the
language
under
52(a)
that
we
would
direct
your
attention,
justice
stevens,
is
to
affecting
the
substantial
right,
and
this
court
has
made
it
clear
since
at
least
chapman
that
even
constitutional
errors
are
subject
to
harmless
error
inquiry.
the
inquiry
is
not
whether
a
substantial
right
has
been...
is
in
question,
but
whether
the
right
is
affected
by
a
violation
that
contributes
to
the
jury's
verdict.
that
is
the
inquiry
that
the
court
set
forth
in
kotteakos
and
in
chapman.
mr.
bruce
neil
kuhlik
we
say
there
may
well
be
a
substantial
right,
but--
mr.
bruce
neil
kuhlik
--that
is
the
inquiry
to
be
undertaken
in
this
specific
case,
did
the
misjoinder
affect
the
substantial
right,
the
substantial
right
being
the
right
to
a
jury
verdict
untainted
by
whatever
error
took
place.
mr.
bruce
neil
kuhlik
in
the
mcelroy
case,
which
was
decided
in
1896,
the
court
responded
to
the
government's
argument
that
the
error
of
misjoinder
in
that
case
did
not
affect
the
verdict
by
saying
that
they
could
not
say
that
the
verdict
wasn't
affected
there.
but
i
would
note
that
the
case
was--
mr.
bruce
neil
kuhlik
--they
confessed
error--
mr.
bruce
neil
kuhlik
--but
the
portion
of
the
court's
discussion
to
which
you
are
referring
referred,
i
believe,
to
the
part
of
the
judgment
in
which
the
government
had
not
confessed
error,
which
was
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
the
three
defendants
who
were
charged
in
all
counts
had
not
had
their
rights
affected.
and
i
would
note
that
mcelroy
was
decided
over
20
years
before
the
first
harmless
error
statute
was
enacted.
mr.
bruce
neil
kuhlik
well,
perhaps
the
best
way
to
put
it
is
that
the
substantial
right
in
any
case
is
the
right
to
a
jury
verdict
that
has
not
been
affected
by
error,
and
in
that
respect
we
would
say
that
if
there
has
been
misjoinder,
the
court
must
inquire
into
whether
the
substantial
right
which
is
to
the
untainted
jury
verdict
has
been
affected
in
the
particular
case.
28
usc
2111
does
not--
mr.
bruce
neil
kuhlik
--exactly.
i
mean,
that
is...
what
the
rule
was
called
is
the
harmless
error
rule,
and
the
rule,
which
is
to
be
read
of
a
piece
with
section
2111
of
the
code,
which
does
not
have
the
substantial
right
language,
i
believe.
well,
section
2111
was
designed
simply
to
make
sure
that
the
harmless
error
rule
applied
on
appeal,
and
the
court...
congress,
when
it
reenacted
that
statute
in
1948
specifically
did
away
with
the
technical
modifier
on
error.
so,
the
point
is
that
congress
has
made
it
clear
both
in
the
rule
and
in
the
statute,
and
this
court
has
certainly
made
it
clear
in
chapman
that
the
harmless
error
inquiry
is
not
limited
to
mere
technical
defects.
it
applies
whether
the
error
is
constitutional,
whether
it
is
statutory,
whether
it
is
a
violation
of
the
criminal
rules.
that
is
all
that
we
ask
here,
is
that
this
same
inquiry
be
made
with
respect
to
misjoinder.
and
in
that
regard,
the
harmless
error
inquiry
serves
several
important
purposes,
principally
the
prompt
and
fair
administration
of
justice,
and
it
gives
effect
to
the
central
purpose
of
a
criminal
trial,
which
is
to
determine
the
factual
issue
of
the
defendant's
guilt
or
innocence,
not
to
sow
the
seeds
for
reversible
error
upon
later
review.
and
these...
these
considerations
have
special
force
in
the
context
of
misjoinder,
which
is
a
fairly
common
technical
violation
of
the
rules
that
often,
as
we
submit
here,
have
an
absolutely
minimal
effect
on
the
outcome
of
the
trial.
now,
we
do
not
believe
that
misjoinder
can
be
said
to
fit
within
any
of
the
exceptions
that
the
court
has
recognized
to
the
harmless
error
rule.
the
principal
exception
that
the
court
has
recognized
is
for
rights
that
are
so
fundamental
to
the
modern
conception
of
a
criminal
trial
that
they
simply
cannot
be
deemed
harmless.
for
example,
the
right
to
access
to
counsel
or
to
a
trial
before
an
unbiased
tribunal.
but
rule
8
simply
does
not
rise
anywhere
near
this
level.
it
is
not
even
a
constitutional
standard
to
begin
with,
much
less
one
that
is
so
fundamental
that
unlike
most
constitutional
rights
under
chapman
should
be
excepted
from
harmless
error
inquiry.
nor
do
we
believe
that
there
is
any
other
basis
for
excepting
rule
8
from
the
harmless
error
inquiry.
as
we
discussed
answering
justice
stevens'
question,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
mcelroy
case
stands
for
such
a
proposition.
moreover,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
rule
14,
which
applies
to
prejudicial
joinder,
does
not
stand
as
a
directive
to
exempt
rule
8
from
misjoinder.
we
would
also
submit
that
the
error
here
in
this
particular
case
was
clearly
harmless
in
view
of
the
strength
of
the
government's
case,
the
district
court's
careful
instructions
to
the
jury
considering
the
separate
consideration
to
be
given
to
each
defendant,
and
that
the
jury
not
consider
the
evidence
with
respect
to
count
1
against
dennis
lane,
and
the
fact
that
much
of
this
evidence
would
properly
be
admissible
on
retrial
in
any
event.
turning
to
the
mail
fraud
issue--
mr.
bruce
neil
kuhlik
--that
is
the
standard
inquiry
that
the
court
of
appeals
would
make
in
reviewing
whether
the
error
was
harmless.
all
we
ask
is
for
a
chance
to
get
the
court
of
appeals
to
make
the
inquiry.
mr.
bruce
neil
kuhlik
well,
it
is
not--
mr.
bruce
neil
kuhlik
--well,
i
would
point
first
to
the
fact
that
we
do
believe
that
the
evidence
of
count
1
would
come
in
on
retrial
under...
at
least
under
rule
404.
mr.
bruce
neil
kuhlik
no,
it
would
come
in
as
respect
to
the
father,
and
the
son
would
get
exactly
the
same
limiting
instruction
on
retrial
that
he
got
here.
under
the
court
of
appeals
judgment,
the
defendants
do
not
have
to
be
tried
separately
on
remand.
they
can
be
tried
on
counts
2
through
6
together.
mr.
bruce
neil
kuhlik
and
at
such
a
trial,
i
would
expect
the
government
to
offer
evidence
of
the
count
1
arson.
mr.
bruce
neil
kuhlik
one
through
five.
yes,
justice--
mr.
bruce
neil
kuhlik
--they
could
do
it
either
way--
mr.
bruce
neil
kuhlik
--that
they
wanted
to,
but
i
would
think
that
any
time
that
the
same
evidence
would
be
admissible
on
retrial,
that
would
be
an
extremely
strong
consideration
favoring
the
harmlessness
of
the
error.
but
even
if
that
were
not
so,
it
is
the
same
inquiry
that
the
court
of
appeals
would
make
whenever
evidence
were,
say,
erroneously
admitted
at
trial,
how
central
was
that
evidence,
could
it
be
kept
separate,
what
effect
did
it
have.
and
as
i
say--
mr.
bruce
neil
kuhlik
--of
course,
the
first
inquiry
for
the
court
of
appeals,
justice
o'connor,
will
be
whether
rule
8
was
violated
at
all.
mr.
bruce
neil
kuhlik
well,
the...
i
think
that
the
district
court's
determination
that
there
was
no
prejudice
would
be
a
factor
of
some
moment,
but
it
would
not
be
controlling,
because
at
the
time
that
the
district
court
makes
its
rule
14
determination,
that
is
before
trial,
and
we
would
ask
that
the
court
of
appeals
would
make
the
standard
harmless
error
inquiry,
which
is
on
the
record
developed
at
the
trial
itself.
mr.
bruce
neil
kuhlik
that's
right,
justice
rehnquist.
i
would
like
to
turn
now
to
the
mail
fraud
issue.
mr.
bruce
neil
kuhlik
well,
the
showing
of
prejudice
is
basically
the
same,
but
the
burdens
and
the
standards
applied
by
the
courts
would
be
somewhat
different
depending
on
whether
you
are
in
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals,
and...
but
the
generic
inquiry
into
the
sort
of
prejudice
that
can
take
place
is
the
same,
your
honor.
the
scheme
that
was
alleged
in
counts
2
through
4
of
the
indictment
was
primarily
one
to
defraud
the
insurance
company
by
running
up
the
repair
costs
on
the
building
that
the
defendants
had
burned
after
it
turned
out
that
their
torch
was
unable
to
destroy
it
completely.
now,
the
elements
of
a
mail
fraud
offense
under
section
1341
are
a
scheme
to
defraud
and
a
mailing
in
furtherance
of
this
scheme
caused
by
the
defendant.
now,
the
defendants
here
do
not
challenge
the
jury
instructions
which
plainly
set
forth
the
governing
law,
nor
do
they
challenge
that
they
had
a
scheme
to
defraud,
that
they
intended
to
defraud
the
insurance
company,
or
that
they
caused
the
mailings
that
took
place.
they
say
only
that
the
mailings
could
not
have
furthered
their
scheme
because
they
had
already
received
the
funds
in
question.
this
is
plainly
wrong.
turning
first
to
counts
2
and
3,
which
can
be
disposed
of
almost
immediately,
these
counts
alleged
mailings
that
took
place
in
may
and
august
of
1980
before
the
defendants
had
received
the
last
and
largest
payment
in
september.
the
scheme
was
quite
plainly
ongoing
at
this
time,
and
indeed
dennis
lane
admitted
at
trial
that
they
would
not
have
received
the
final
payment
had
not
the
earlier
mailing
been
made.
this
leaves
count
4,
which
charged
the
mailing
of
fabricated
repair
invoices
that
the
defendants
had
submitted
to
the
insurance
adjuster
and
that
the
adjuster
mailed
to
company
headquarters
two
days
after
issuing
a
draft
for
$12,000
to
the
defendants.
now,
again,
the
jury
was
properly
instructed
that
if
the
scheme
had
ended
by
this
time,
then
they
had
to
acquit.
of
course,
they
did
not.
the
draft
payment
that
was
made
did
not
irrevocably
vest
the
funds
in
the
defendants.
unlike
a
check,
it
still
had
to
be
cleared
by
the
insurance
company
headquarters,
and
the
evidence
was
clear
that
if
something
had
been
amiss
with
the
policy
claim,
the
insurance
company
would
not
have
authorized
payment,
and
the
bank
would
have
charged
back
against
the
defendants
for
any
funds
that
they
had
already
withdrawn,
so
the
defendants
had
not
received
the
funds
in
question.
but
even
if
they
had,
that
does
not
carry
with
it
a
blanket
immunity
from
the
mail
fraud
statute.
this
court
in
samson
and
the
courts
of
appeals
have
consistently
made
it
clear
that
mailings
that
have
the
effect
of
lulling
the
defendants'
victims
into
a
false
sense
of
security,
thereby
postponing
their
complaint
to
the
authorities
and
making
it
less
likely
that
the
defendants
will
be
found
out
are
within
the
mail
fraud
statute.
that
is
precisely
what
happened
here,
as
the
court
of
appeals
found.
i
mean,
it
is
difficult
to
think
of
something
more
directly
connected
to
a
scheme
to
defraud
the
insurance
company
than
the
mailing
of
the
fraudulent
proof
of
loss
forms
and
invoices
to
the
company
itself.
the
defendants
have
only
one
final
argument,
which
is
that
we
neither
charged
nor
proved
that
they
had
the
specific
intent
to
use
the
mails.
this
failure
is
hardly
surprising
in
light
of
the
fact
that
the
court
has
consistently
made
it
clear,
for
example,
in
perrera,
that
no
specific
intent
to
use
the
mails
is
required.
all
that
is
needed
is
that
the
use
of
the
mails
be
reasonably
foreseeable,
which
the
defendants
admit
that
it
was.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
mr.
bruce
neil
kuhlik
--the
latter,
justice
o'connor.
as
long
as
an
intent
to
defraud
is
charged
and
proven,
that
is
sufficient,
and
if
the
mailing
then
has
the
effect
of
furthering
the
entire
scheme
by
lulling,
that
is
plainly
sufficient.
it
has
never
been
the
law
that
a
further
intent
that
the
mailing
itself
be
used
or
further
the
scheme
to--
mr.
bruce
neil
kuhlik
--in
my
research,
i
have
not
seen
a
single
lower
court
decision
requiring
an
intent
to
defraud,
and
among
the
cases
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
on
page
32
i
would
point
specifically
to
the
jones
and
toney
cases
as
cases
that
involve
lulling
mailings,
where
this
court
expressly
said
that
no
intent
to
lull
was
required--
mr.
bruce
neil
kuhlik
--no,
you
don't,
because
the
mailings
did
not...
the
funds
had
not
been
completely
received.
mr.
bruce
neil
kuhlik
had
the
father
been
tried
alone,
then
rule
8(a)
would
have
been
applicable,
and
count
1
would
properly
have
been
joined
with
the
other
counts.
mr.
bruce
neil
kuhlik
to
claim
that
there
has
been
an
error
at
all--
mr.
bruce
neil
kuhlik
--well,
certainly,
as
we
point
cut
in
the
brief,
we
don't
see
how
the
judgment
could
possibly
have...
how
the
misjoinder
could
possibly
have--
mr.
bruce
neil
kuhlik
--right,
because
he
would
get
virtually
the
same
trial
on
remand.
either
count
1
would
be
included
or
count
6
would
be
included,
and
we
don't
see
how
there
could
be
any
prejudice
by
including
both
of
them
together.
mr.
bruce
neil
kuhlik
well,
there
is
clearly
an
error
with
respect
to--
mr.
bruce
neil
kuhlik
--the
son,
which
would
lead
the
court
to
have
to
reach
the
harmlessness
issue
on
which
there
is
a
conflict
in
the
circuits.
we
haven't
raised
the
factual
question.
mr.
bruce
neil
kuhlik
i
think
i
would
have
to
know...
i
certainly
think
that
the
court
would
undertake
a
more
complete
harmless
error
inquiry
than
it
professed
to
do
in
mcelroy
itself.
mr.
bruce
neil
kuhlik
well,
i
think
it--
mr.
bruce
neil
kuhlik
--well,
i
think
saying
that
it
was
obviously
prejudicial
was
a
truncated
means
of
saying
that
the
error
was
not
harmless.
mr.
bruce
neil
kuhlik
if
there
was
a
misjoined
count
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
one
of
the
defendants,
and
the
evidence
on
that
count
was
extremely
strong
and
prejudicial,
i
would
fully
expect
the
court
of
appeals
might
well
find
the
error
not
harmless.
but
that
is
the
inquiry
that
would
have
to
be
made.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
bruce
neil
kuhlik
two
points,
your
honor.
first,
justice
o'connor
asked
me
earlier
about
the
effect
of
a
district
court's
finding
that
there
was
not
sufficient
prejudice
to
require
a
severance
under
rule
14.
i
would
like
to
clarify
that
a
greater
amount
of
prejudice
could
certainly
be
tolerated
under
rule
14
than
would
be
tolerated
on
a
harmless
error
inquiry
under
rule
8,
so
that
the
district
court
would
have
the
discretion
to
refuse
to
grant
a
severance
under
rule
14
because
the
additional
amount
of
prejudice
would
be
tolerable
there
that
amount
of
prejudice
would
result
in
a
reversal
under
rule
8
on
appeal.
the
second
point
is
simply
to
emphasize
that
under
the
mail
fraud
statute
there
is
no
separate
crime
of
lulling.
the
crime
is
a
scheme
to
defraud.
lulling
is
simply
one
way
that
the
mailing
can
further
that
scheme.
if
there
is
nothing
further.
