mr.
clifford
w.
brown
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
in
the
beginning
i
would
state
that
the
government's
statement
of
the
case
appears
to
me
to
be
complete
and
accurate.
so
it
is
unnecessary
for
me
to
proceed
to
supplement
that.
if
by--
mr.
clifford
w.
brown
--no,
i
do
not
believe
that.
i
am
talking
about
their
factual
statement
of
the
background
of
the
case,
not
their
conclusions,
your
honor.
the
court,
the
appellate
court
said
that
count
1
should
not
have
been
joined
with
the
others
because
it
was
not
part
of
the
same
series
of
acts
or
transactions
as
count
2
through
4.
the
government,
of
course,
their
single
complaint
as
to
the
first
part
of
their
brief
relates
to
the
failure
of
the
court
to
make
application
of
the
harmless
error
rule,
and
they
contend
that
a
conviction
may
not
be
reversed
under
rule
8(b)
unless...
if
the
error
was
harmless.
now,
it
is
our
contention
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
err
in
reversing
without
determining
the
question
of
misjoinder.
i
think
it
is
significant,
and
perhaps
we
need
to
note
in
passing
that
the
government
in
its
brief
gives
great
consideration
to
the
case
of
u.s.
versus
hasting,
but
never
once
has
counsel
argued
that.
because
it
is
in
the
brief,
i
feel
that
i
need
to
confront
it
in
order
that
it
not
go
unanswered
but
remain
for
consideration
in
the
brief.
we
believe
that
despite
the
holding
in
hasting,
that
the...
that
harmless
error
does
not
apply
to
the
rule
8(b)
violations
in
this
case,
and
that
there
is
in
fact
a
basis
for
excepting
misjoinder
from
the
harmless
error
rule.
mr.
clifford
w.
brown
my
position
is
exactly
that,
justice
white.
i
believe
that
misjoinder
is
per
se
reversible.
now,
before--
mr.
clifford
w.
brown
--beg
pardon?
mr.
clifford
w.
brown
yes,
and
the
reason
that
i
say
that,
justice
white,
is
because
i
believe
that
the
rules
to
make
proof
have
carefully
placed
the
boundaries
under
rule
8(b),
and
they
have
established
standards,
and
they
say
beyond
this
standard
you
shall
not
go,
and
they
say
in
effect
that
misjoinder
is
reversible.
there
are
numberless
reasons
to
illustrate
this.
we
know
what
many
of
these
are.
we
know
that
there
is
danger
in
misjoinder
that
there
will
be
a
transference
of
guilt.
we
know
that
there
is
danger
under
king
versus
u.s.
of
guilt
by
association,
evidentiary
spillover,
and
the
reasons
cited
in
mcelroy.
now,
let
me
say
simply
this
in
regards
to
hasting.
the
reason
we
say
hastings
does
not
apply
in
this
case
because
hastings
is...
hasting
is
not
a
misjoinder
case,
and
we
think
that
that
is
very
important,
because
all
hasting
really
did
was
to
make
a
global
statement
of
general
principles
about
the
harmless
error
doctrine,
and
hasting
itself
recognizes
that
there
are
certain
categories
of
cases
to
which
the
harmless
error
doctrine
does
not
apply.
counsel
stated
those,
those
that
deny
an
impartial
magistrate
like
tumey
versus
ohio,
those
that
professor
wright
mentions,
like
the
estes
case
where
there
is
pretrial
prejudice,
double
jeopardy,
and
then
finally
the
denial
of
counsel
as
is
set
out
in
wainwright
and
in
strickland
versus
washington,
and
strickland
versus
washington
says
that
in
some
cases
that
the
cost
of
this
case
by
case
inquiry
into
prejudice
would
be
cost
prohibitive
because
there
is
such
a
potential
for
prejudice
in
rule
8(b)
violations,
and
if
we
turn
to
mcelroy,
and
incidentally,
mcelroy
is
still
good,
viable
law.
mr.
clifford
w.
brown
i
think
that
it
is
because
it
continues
to
be
cited
by
the
differing
authorities
throughout
the
land.
it
continues
to
be
cited
by
this
court.
and
even
more
important
than
that,
mcelroy
included
a
discussion
of
the
very
elements
that
are
presented
by
the
rule
52(a).
mr.
clifford
w.
brown
yes,
and
let
me
tell
you,
justice
white,
why
i
believe
that,
because
the...
because
i
believe
that
the
reasoning
that
mcelroy
confronted
exactly
the
same
issues
as
involved
in
rule
52(a),
and
your
honor,
i
apologize.
you
are
justice
rehnquist,
and
i
apologize
for
my
error.
mr.
clifford
w.
brown
i
hesitate
to
say,
your
honor.
i
apologize
to
both
for
my
error.

[generallaughter.]
mr.
clifford
w.
brown
i
say--
mr.
clifford
w.
brown
--i
say
that
kotteakos...
no,
i
do...
well,
let
me
say
this.
i
say
that
kotteakos
applies
more
to
the
question
of
joinder
or
misjoinder
in
relation
to
52(a),
because
kotteakos
says
that
misjoinder
is
a
violation
of
a
substantial
right,
that
right
being
not
to
be
tried
en
masse,
and
of
course
we
know
mcelroy
is
exactly
what
happened.
there
were
eight
defendants,
originally
nine.
one
somehow
was
dropped,
and
eight
in
two
separate
indictments,
six
in
one
and
two
in
the
other,
were
consolidated
for
trial,
and
mcelroy
said
that
it
is
the
substantial
right
not
to
be
tried
en
masse,
and
kotteakos
picks
up
on
that.
kotteakos
says
that
it
is
rather
even
so
whether
the
error
itself
had
substantial
influence.
it
says,
if
so,
or
if
one
is
left
in
grave
doubt,
the
conviction
cannot
stand.
i
believe
it
important
to
mention
as
one
of
the
justices
has
the
fact
that
there
are
two
people
charged
in
this
case,
father
and
son,
and
when
we
are
talking
about
the
question
of
harmless
error,
there
are
evidentiary
facts
that
make
for
differing
interpretations
as
to
the
relative
guilt
of
these
individuals,
and
certainly
as
to
the
relative
prejudice.
we
know
that
rule
8(b)
prevents
the
necessity
of
a
defense
of
a
multiplicity
of
offenses,
and
we
know
that
it
also
preserves
the
integrity
of
the
fact
finding
process.
of
course,
the
other
side
of
that
is
the
argument
that
joinder
promotes
judicial
economy,
but
we
believe
that
any
benefit
in
this
regard
is
outweighed
by
the
inherent
prejudice
of
misjoinder.
i
would
like
to
talk
with
the
court
briefly
about
the
government's
construction
in
its
brief
about
rule
8(b)
and
52(a),
and
we
say
that
their
argument
for
the
construction
of
rule
52(a),
the
harmless
error
rule,
in
application
to
all
cases
would
simply
eviscerate
rule
8(b),
because
rule
8(b)
sets
the
limits,
and
says
that
misjoinder
exists
if
you
have
a
joinder
in
violation
of
it.
now,
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
in
the
case
of
ward
versus
united
states,
that
chief
justice
burger
himself
when
writing
as
a
circuit
judge
relying
upon
mcelroy
said
that
where
multiple
defendants
are
charged
with
offenses
in
no
way
connected
and
are
tried
together,
they
are
prejudiced
by
this
very
fact,
and
the
trial
judge
has
no
discretion
to
deny
relief.
mr.
clifford
w.
brown
that
was
cited
out
of
the
d.c.
circuit
in
1961,
your
honor,
and
that
which
i
read
was
a
direct
quote
from
ingram,
which
your
honor
cited
along
with
schaffer
and
welch
and
mcelroy.
now--
mr.
clifford
w.
brown
--your
honor,
unfortunately,
memory
escapes
me
of
the
name
of
any.
i
believe
that
i
have
seen
such.
i
do
know
this,
that
the
mcelroy...
in
my
opinion,
and
i
was
asked
about
kotteakos,
i
believe
that
the
mcelroy
analysis
of
misjoinder
is
completely
consistent
with
justice
black's
opinion
in
chapman
versus
california
and
justice
rutledge's
opinion
in
kotteakos
versus
u.s.--
now,
professor
wright
has
said
that
cases
holding
that
misjoinder
cannot
be
harmless
error
have
consistently
relied
upon
mcelroy
in
their
reasoning
and
in
their
language
as
well,
and
i
think
it
is
important
to
note
as
justice
stevens'
question
indicates
that
rule
52(a)
in
talking
about
harmless
error
has
a
specific
exception
in
it
when
it
says
any
error,
defect,
irregularity,
or
variance
which
does
not
affect
substantial
rights,
and
as
i
have
said
previously,
kotteakos
says
that
misjoinder
is
a
violation
of
a
substantial
right,
because
it
is
a
violation
of
the
right
not
to
be
tried
en
masse.
mr.
clifford
w.
brown
i
cannot
think
of
any
right
now,
your
honor.
in
that
regard,
i
do
think
that
it
is
important
that
we
remember
that
rule
16(b)
itself...
i
am
sorry,
that
rule
8(b)
talks
about
the
competing
considerations
that
exist
in
these
cases,
and
it
just...
it
just
simply
says...
oh,
wait
a
minute.
i
remember
now
the
answer
to
your
question.
you
were
asking
me
if
i
knew
of
any
other
cases
that
didn't
have
constitutional
errors.
i
cannot
name
any.
but
what
i
wanted
to
say
in
response,
your
honor,
is
this,
that
the
rule
making
authority
that
was
delegated
by
the
congress
to
the
court
under
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
of
the
third
amendment
makes
the
enunciation
of
this
rule
literally
in
my
opinion
a
constitutional
mandate.
and
i
think
that
while
it
may
not
rise
to
the
height
of
a
constitutional
error,
that
it
still
is
a
significant
mandate
of
the
congress
through
its
authorized
rule
making
authority,
and
that
it
should
not
and
cannot
be
denominated
as
harmless
error.
there
were...
i
want
to
turn
now
to
my
consideration
of
the
second
point,
but
before
i
do
that,
i
want
to
talk
with
the
court
about
the
government's
contention
that
the
misjoinder
in
this
case
could
be
taken
care
of
by
considerations
such
as
the
overwhelming
weight
of
the
evidence
and
the
fact
that
much
of
the
evidence
would
be
admissible
in
the
trial
of
another
case
upon
remand,
and
their
matters
in
regards
to
retrial.
we
think
that
an
attempt
to
retry
these
defendants
together
would
again
accentuate
the
inherent
prejudice
that
incurred
to
dennis
lane
by
having
this
particular
count
1
presented
and
evidence
presented
in
regard
to
that
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
trial
jury.
there
are...
i
believe
that
one
of
the
justices
mentioned
the
possibility
of
error
to
the
various
parties,
and
i
think
this
is
something
that
we
need
to
consider
here.
the
evidence
that
was
admitted
under
count
1
in
this
case
obviously
contributed
to
the
conviction
of
dennis
lane
on
the
other
cases.
now,
the
count
1,
we
need
to
remember,
related
to
a
fire
over
a
year
in
advance
of
the
fire
alleged
in
counts
2,
3,
and
4,
and
it
was
charged
alone
against
j.c.
lane,
who
was
the
father
of
dennis
lane.
now,
when
you
come
along
and
consider
the
one
charge
against
j.c.
lane
in
the
first
count,
counts
2,
3,
and
4
involve
both
defendants,
and
count
5
involved
both
defendants
in
a
conspiracy
to
commit
arson
for
profit.
now,
if
we
had
only
counts
2,
3,
and
1
which
relates
alone
to
j.c.
lane,
then
we
have
two
fires
involved
in
a
single
family,
and
certainly
a
suspicion
that
this
was
not
accidental
or
the
overpowering
urge
to
consider
that
there
may
be
some
connection.
and
then
when
we
add
court
5,
which
relates
to
the
conspiracy
between
father
and
son
to
carry
out
a
scheme
for
profit
in
lubbock,
texas,
we
have
evidence
there
presented
of
three
separate
fires.
now,
there
is
danger
to
j.c.
lane
in
count
1
because
of
the
possibility
of
the
jury
saying
here
is
a
father
who
not
only
did
something
himself,
but
he
involved
his
son
in
a
later
and
still...
a
later
transaction
and
still
later
conspiracy.
so,
we
think
clearly
the
danger
is
evident
in
count
1
as
to
both
of
them,
and
then
the
misjoinder
of
count
6
resulted
in
prejudice,
we
believe,
to
j.c.
lane
because...
and
certainly
to
dennis
because
dennis
is
charged
with
perjury,
and
he
is
charged
with
perjury
directly
in
relation
to
count
5,
which
is
the
conspiracy
to
commit
arson
in
lubbock,
and
in
counts
2
through
5
of
the
indictment,
in
addition
to
alleging
his
own
criminal
activity,
then
j.c.
lane
is
involved
in
arson
with
his
son,
and
then
count
6
in
regard
to
perjury
involves
him
in
perjury
in
relation
to
another
count
on
conspiracy
where
he
is
charged
with
his
father.
and
so
there
is
a
possibility
for
it
to
begin
to
look
like
that
father
influenced
son
and
the
son
is
supporting
the
father.
mr.
clifford
w.
brown
well,
some
of
it
might,
your
honor.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
evidence
in
relation
to
count
1
could
ever
be
properly
admissible
against
dennis
lane
on
retrial.
mr.
clifford
w.
brown
no,
i
would
admit
to
that,
your
honor.
it
is
not
meant,
but
it
is
meant
to
try
to
keep
out
prejudice
because
of
misjoinder
that
permits
evidence
of
multiple
offenses.
mr.
clifford
w.
brown
yes.
i
want
to
turn
now
to
a
consideration
of
our
contention
that
the
evidence
is
insufficient
to
support
the
conviction
on
count
2
through
4
of
the
indictment.
now,
the
article
18,
usca's
1341,
requires
that
the
government
prove
that
the
alleged
use
of
the
mails
was
for
the
purpose
of
executing
the
scheme.
we
cite
kahn
versus
u.s.,
which
says
that
the
statute
only
reaches
those
instances
in
which
the
use
of
the
mails
is
in
the
execution
of
the
fraud.
our
allegation
is
that
in
counts
2,
3,
and
4,
which
relate
to
arson
in
regards
to
an
address
of
1105
south
jackson
in
amarillo,
that
the
scheme
had
reached
its
fruition
as
ch
count
or
each
offense,
2,
3,
and
4,
because
dennis
lane
had
received
the
money
prior
to
the
mailing.
now,
there
is
a
chart
at
page
29
of
our
brief,
and
i
call
it
to
the
court's
attention
because
it
sets
out
very
clearly
the
counts,
the
date
that
the
check
was
received,
and
the
date
of
the
mailing
of
the
proof
of
loss
or
other
paper
in
connection
therewith.
count
2,
dennis
lane
received
the
check
on
5/9/80
in
amarillo,
texas,
from
a
local
adjuster
who
wrote
it
out
in
his
office
in
front
of
him
and
delivered
it
to
him.
dennis
lane
delivered
to
the
man
a
proof
of
loss
at
the
same
time.
the
mailing
was
not
until
5/15,
some
six
days
later.
the
evidence
actually
showed
that
dennis
lane
had
that
check
in
his
bank
account
and
had
spent
almost
all
of
it
before
the
mailing
occurred.
count
3
was
on
the
21st
of
may,
1980,
and
the
mailing
was
not
until
august
the
6th
of
1980.
now,
the
same--
mr.
clifford
w.
brown
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
clifford
w.
brown
and,
of
course,
we
join
issue
with
the
government,
your
honor,
at
that
very
point.
mr.
clifford
w.
brown
no,
your
honor.
mr.
clifford
w.
brown
we
did--
mr.
clifford
w.
brown
--your
honor,
that
objection
does
not
find
its
way
into
this
record
to
the
best
of
my--
mr.
clifford
w.
brown
--to
the
best
of
my
knowledge.
mr.
clifford
w.
brown
no,
we
did
not,
your
honor.
what
we
do
argue,
your
honor.
mr.
clifford
w.
brown
that
perhaps
is
so,
and
for
that
reason,
your
honor,
i
would
like
at
this
time
to
discuss
that
aspect
of
our
brief.
we
believe

in

and
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
actually
confused
the
foreseeability
of
mailing
with
the
preconceived
intent
to
lull
by
the
use

what
we
do

is
this,
that
the

in

because
of

we
believe
there
is

neither

can

that
