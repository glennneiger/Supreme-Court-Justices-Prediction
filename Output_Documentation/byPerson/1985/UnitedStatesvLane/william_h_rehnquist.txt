justice
william
h.
rehnquist
rule
14
deals...
isn't
that
the
situation
where
there
is
a
proper
joinder
under
rule
8,
but
the
defendant
claims
that
there
is
some
prejudice
which
entitles
him
to
a
severance
even
though
he
wouldn't
be
entitled
to
it
under
rule
8?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
makes
you
think
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
think
under
the
court's
decision
in
mcelroy
it
is
perfectly
consistent
with
the
terms
of
rule
52(a).
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
know
to
whom
the
apology
is
due--
0
[generallaughter.]
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
couldn't
some
of
that
evidence
come
in
as
the
government
says...
pattern
or
practice
and
things
like
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean,
the
misjoinder
rule
isn't
designed
to
prevent
relevant
evidence
from
being
introduced
against
a
defendant.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
otherwise
would
be
inadmissible.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
do
you
say
that?
i
mean,
the
government
takes
the
position
that
the
intent
to
defraud
is
all
the
statute
requires,
and
i
think
reading
the
statute
that
is
a
pretty
fair
inference
from
it.
why
do
you
think
that
intent
to
lull
is
a
kind
of
a
substantive
element
of
the
crime
rather
than
just
something
to
conform
to
the
commerce
requirement.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
i
think
the
government
says
intent
to
lull
should
make
the
difference
between
that
and...
in
other
words,
that
the
government
is
not
arguing
intent
to
defraud.
they
are
arguing
that
there
was
an
intent
to
lull
when
there
is
no
evidentiary
basis
for
that.
i
thought
the
government
took
the
position
that
intent
to
lull
was
not
necessary
so
long
as
the
defendant's
conduct
has
the
effect
of
lulling.
do
you
disagree
with
that?
