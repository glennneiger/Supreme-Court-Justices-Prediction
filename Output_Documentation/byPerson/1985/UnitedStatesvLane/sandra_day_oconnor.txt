mr.
kuhlik,
what
would
happen
in
the
event
of
a
misjoinder
of
parties
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
when
a
defendant
joined
in
the
action,
makes
a
rule
14
motion
for
severance,
for
example,
and
the
trial
court
determines,
well,
you
didn't
established
prejudice,
and
i
am
not
going
to
sever,
and
after
the
trial
there
is
a
harmless
error
inquiry,
if
your
position
is
adopted?
how
will
that
earlier
determination
under
rule
14
affect
the
harmless
error
inquiry?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
let's
assume
it
was,
or
is.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
do
have
a
question,
mr.
kuhlik.
it
isn't
clear
to
me
whether
you
take
the
position
that
on
a
mail
fraud
count
the
government
has
to
prove
an
intent
to
lull
in
order
to
convict
on
that
theory
under
the
statute,
or
whether
merely
an
effect
of
lulling
is
enough.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
the
lower
courts
are
in
total
agreement
with
that
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
guess
we
don't
have
to
really
decide
that
in
this
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
government
relies,
counsel,
on
the
lulling
of
the
victim
cases.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
so
it
seems
to
me
that
is
what
you
have
to
deal
with,
and
of
course
the
government
takes
the
position
that
merely
having
the
effect
of
lulling
is
enough
without
intending
to
do
so.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right.
did
the
jury
in
this
case
require...
did
the
trial
court
instructions
require
the
jury
to
find
an
intent
to
lull
in
order
to
find
mail
fraud?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
you
object
on
that
ground
at
the
time,
to
those--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--instructions
for
that
reason?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
didn't
find
it,
no.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
really
didn't
raise
any
question
here,
did
you,
in
your
cross
petition
with
regard
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
instructions
to
the
jury.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
all
we
would
have
to
do,
then,
is
to
see
whether
there
was
sufficient
evidence
in
the
record
to
at
least
support
a
finding
of
an
intent
to
lull,
and
that
would
resolve
this
case.
