mr.
kuhlik,
may
i
just
raise
this
question
before
you
get
too
deeply
into
the
argument?
the
language
of
rule
52
refers
to
error
which
does
not
affect
substantial
rights.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
the
government's
position
that
misjoinder
does
not
affect
substantial
rights,
or
that
even
if
it
does
affect
substantial
rights,
the
harmless
error
inquiry
is--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
i
still
don't...
i
am
not
quite
sure
what
your
answer
is
to
my
question.
do
you
agree...
do
you
say
there
is
or
is
not
substantial
right
at
stake
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
you
say
that
misjoinder
does
not
affect
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
mcelroy
case
as
i
read
it,
they
said
there
was
a
substantial
right
affected,
and
that
for
that
reason
it
was
reversible
error.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
government
confessed
error
in
that
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
didn't
make
that
argument.
they
agreed
it
did
affect
substantial
rights,
and
they
agreed
that
as
to
some
of
the
defendants
it
should
be
reversed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
rule
52(a)
expressly
picks
up
the
substantial
right
language,
and
that
is
why
i
am
just
not
entirely...
still
not
entirely
clear
what
you
are
saying.
you
are
saying
that
there
is
a
substantial
right
involved,
but
it
is
not
affected
if
one
can
call
it
harmless?
is
that
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
wouldn't
that
make
the
rule
read
exactly...
what
you
really
do,
as
i
understand
your
interpretation,
the
rule
then
should
simply
read,
"any
error,
defect,
irregularity,
or
variance.
"
--i
see,
"which
does
not
affect
substantial
rights
shall
be
disregarded.
"
you
are
saying
if
it
is...
that
is
the
equivalent
of
harmless.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
it
is
not
true
in
this
case,
but
supposing
you
had
a
case
in
which
the
evidence
on
count
1
were
overwhelming,
and
it
was
a
very
close
case
on
the
other
five
counts.
would
you
say
in
that
situation
it
might
be
considered
that
it
would
not
be
harmless?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
you
would
think...
so
our
duty
is
to
see
how
overwhelming
the
evidence
is
on
the
five
other
counts.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
how
does
the
harmless
error
inquiry
proceed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
to
the
son?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
wouldn't
the
government
be
free
to
elect
to
try
1
through
6
together
as
against
the
father?
justice
john
paul
stevens
one
through
five,
excuse
me,
because
six
was
just--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--they
could
do
it
either
way,
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
the
showing
of
prejudice
in
that
context
different
from
the
showing
of
prejudice
necessary
to
defeat
a
harmless
error
claim?
in
other
words,
could
the...
as
long
as
there
is
no
prejudice,
then
the
government
doesn't
have
to
worry
about
misjoinder.
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i...
i
am
sorry.
may
i
ask
one
other
question
on
the
misjoinder
aspect
of
the
case?
do
you
think
the
issue
is
precisely
the
same
as
to
both
respondents?
in
other
words,
the
government,
i
know,
hasn't
challenged
the
misjoinder
in
this
case,
but
do
you
think
there
was
a
misjoinder
of
count
1
as
to
the
father?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
can
he
claim
that
there
was
claim
error
out
of
the
misjoinder?
i
am
just
puzzled.
of
course,
perhaps
i
should
ask
your
opponent,
but
do
you
agree
he
has
the
same
right
to
claim
error
as
the
son
does
out
of
this
misjoinder
of
count
1?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
affects
the
judgment
as
to
him.
justice
john
paul
stevens
misjoinder
of
count
1
could
have--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
just
don't
even...
i
must
confess,
i
have
some
difficulty
seeing
how
there
is
any
even
error
as
to
him
on
that...
on
this
misjoinder
as
to--
count
1,
and
why
we...
it
seems
to
me
that
phrasing
it
in
terms
of
harmless
error
assumes
an
error
that
i
somehow
have
difficulty
identifying.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
son.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
looking
at
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
son,
if
you
prevail
in
this
case
and
the
law
is
as
you
advocate
now,
do
you
think
if
the
same
facts
that
were
present
in
the
mcelroy
case
arose
again,
the
case
would
be
decided
the
same
way
or
differently?
justice
john
paul
stevens
who
didn't
do
any,
in
fact.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
just
said
that
misjoinder
is
obviously
prejudicial.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
reason
it
was
obviously
prejudicial
is
that
a
person
who
is
defending
his
own
case
was
being
tried
with
somebody
who
had
a
lot
of
evidence
of
guilt
as
to
him.
i
mean,
it
is
the
same
set
of
facts.
the
reason
for
finding
error
there
would
apply
in
this
case
as
well.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
brown,
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
kotteakos,
of
course,
was
a
variance
case,
and
they
did
say
harmless
error
inquiry
was
appropriate,
at
least
in
reviewing
variances,
and
this
is
a
misjoinder
case,
and
all
the
other
examples
you
have
given
where
there
was
no
harmless
error
are
constitutional
error
cases.
can
you
give
me
any
example
of
a
nonconstitutional
error
which
is
not
subject
to
harmless
error
inquiry
other
than
misjoinder?
