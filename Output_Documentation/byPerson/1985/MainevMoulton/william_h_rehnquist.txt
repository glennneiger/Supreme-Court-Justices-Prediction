why
do
you
use
the
term
"deliberately
eliciting"?
do
you
use
that
as
a
word
of
art?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
that
moulton
had
simply
met...
saw
colson
regularly
at
an
elks'
lodge
every
tuesday
night
and
just
starting
talking
to
him
there
about
this
previous
crime
he
had
committed
and
colson
goes
to
the
police.
they
say,
well,
you
know,
that
is
very
interesting
information,
we
are
going
to
take
it
down
and
if
you
hear
anything
more,
let
us
know.
so,
colson
sees
him
the
next
tuesday
night
and
moulton
talks
again.
colson
reports
back
to
the
police.
is
there
anything
wrong
with
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
on
earth
could
there
be
wrong
with
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
a
loose-lipped
defendant.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
arguably
as
though
you
think
there
is
some
argument
on
the
other
side.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
can't
the
state
take
advantage
of
factors
that
happen
to
break
its
way
so
long
as
they
don't
violate
some
constitutional
privilege.
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
that
says
the
government
can't
take
advantage
of
a
defendant.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
your
situation?
