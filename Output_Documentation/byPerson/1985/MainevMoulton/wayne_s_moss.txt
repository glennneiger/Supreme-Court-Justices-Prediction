mr.
wayne
s.
moss
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
criminal
case
from
maine
involving
a
massiah
issue
of
whether
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
applied
to
a
post-indictment
meeting
between
respondent
moulton
and
his
friend,
gary
colson,
a
co-defendant,
on
theft
charges.
the
central
question
here
is
whether
the
massiah/henry
rule
should
be
extended
to
the
facts
of
this
particular
case.
there
are
two
factors
here
which
are
important,
distinguishing
this
case
from
massiah
and
henry.
first,
moulton
himself,
not
the
police,
created
his
incriminating
situation
relative
to
the
pending
theft
charges.
second,
the
police
here
put
the
body
wire
on
colson
as
part
of
a
legitimate
investigation
into
a
new
crime
which
was
moulton's
plans
to
murder
a
key
state's
witness,
gary
elwell.
in
light
of
these
two
factors,
there
is
no
deliberate
elicitation
here,
because,
as
the
court
said
in
henry,
the
police
here
did
not
intentionally
create
the
situation
inducing
moulton's
incriminating
statements.
i
would
like
to
address
each
of
these
two
factors
in
turn.
first,
as
i
said,
moulton
himself,
not
the
police,
created
this
incriminating
situation.
moulton
initiated
all
the
contacts
between
himself
and
colson,
including
the
meeting
in
which
he
incriminated
himself.
respondent
concedes
that
it
was
moulton
who
did
arrange
the
meeting
in
which
moulton
incriminated
himself.
moreover,
moulton,
on
his
own
initiative,
put
on
the
agenda
for
that
meeting
a
complete
discussion
of
their
trial
strategy
and
the
perjured
testimony
that
moulton
wanted
them
to
get.
just
further
evidence
that
moulton
himself
created
his
own
incriminating
situation
is
that
some
of
the
statements
at
the
meeting
were
made
without
any
questioning
or
promoting
by
the
informant
colson
at
all
and
other
statements
that
he
made
in
response
to
colson's
questions,
that
colson
asked
those
questions
within
the
role
that
moulton
had
created
for
him
which
was
to
review
discovery
materials
and
prepare
a
perjured
defense
for
trial.
additional
evidence
that
this
moulton/colson
meeting
was
not
a
government-created
confrontation
is
that
here
colson
was
the
one
who
initiated
contact
with
the
police
to
complain
about
threatening
telephone
calls.
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
police
sought
out
the
informant
to
investigate
pending
charges.
the
second
important
factor
here
is
that
the
police
placed
the
body
wire
on
colson
as
part
of
their
legitimate
investigation
into
a
new
crime,
moulton's
plans
to
murder
a
key
state's
witness.
the
suppression
hearing
justice
below
in
fact
found
that
the
police
were
involved
in
this
legitimate
purpose
of
investigating
a
new
crime
and
put
the
body
wire
on
for
that
purpose
and
also
to
protect
colson's
safety
and
not
to
gather
evidence
on
the
pending
charges.
this
finding
is
entitled
to
some
deference
because
it
was
the
suppression
hearing
justice
below
who
heard
the
testimony
firsthand,
observed
the
demeanor
of
the
witnesses
and
found
both
the
police
and
the
informant
colson
to
be
believable.
the
maine
supreme
court
found
ample
evidence
to
support
the
justice's
finding
and
respondent,
as
i
have
said,
concedes
that
there
was
a
legitimate
purpose
here
for
this
investigation
into
murder.
the
police
were
making
every
effort
here
to
comply
with
massiah
while
investigating
the
proposed
murder
and
this
is
evidenced
by
the
police
instructions
themselves.
prior
to
this
moulton/colson
meeting,
the
police
instructed
colson,
the
informant,
to
act
like
himself,
converse
normally,
and
avoid
trying
to
draw
information
out
of
moulton.
the
police
consulted
with
the
local
district
attorney's
office
before
giving
these
instructions
and
the
instructions
themselves
are
consistent
with
massiah
and
show
a
good-faith
effort
to
comply
with
it.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
yes,
he
did
ask
questions.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
no,
he
did
not
elicit
comments
and
the
reason
why
he
did
not
elicit
comments
is
because
those
were
statements
that
either
moulton
was
going
to
make
anyway
or
that
those
questions
that
colson
asked
were
questions
that
moulton
required
him
to
ask
in
order
to
develop
the
perjured
testimony
that
moulton
wanted
him
to
give.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
yes,
and
the
reason
that
our
maine
supreme
judicial
court
disagreed
is
because
our
maine
supreme
court
assumed
that
simply
by
putting
the
body
wire
on
the
informant
that
the
state
somehow
created
the
incriminating
situation.
our
court
also
used
a
foreseeability
test
and
that
is
because
it
was
foreseeable
that
the
defendant
and
the
informant
would
be
having
conversations
about
pending
charges
and
that
the
defendant
would
be
making
incriminating
statements
in
this
conversation,
that
because
this
was
foreseeable
this
also
violated
massiah
and
henry.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
the
evidence
of
murder?
yes,
it
would
have
been
admissible
at
least
insofar
as
it
would
have
showed
any
consciousness
of
guilt.
it
certainly
would
have
been
relevant
evidence.
and,
also
it
would
be
admissible
for
sixth
amendment
purposes
as
well
because,
at
least
as
regards
to
the
murder,
moulton
was
planning
to
commit
the
murder.
there
is
no
right
to
counsel
for
new
crimes
that
someone
is
planning
to
commit.
therefore,
it
should
be
admissible.
another
reason
why
the
murder
evidence
would
be
admissible,
which
also
goes
to
why
all
this
other
evidence
should
be
admissible
as
well,
is
that
there
still
has
to
be
a
government-created
confrontation
for
there
to
be
a
sixth
amendment
violation.
and,
the
state's
position
here
is
that
moulton
in
this
meeting
was
just
continuing
a
discussion
of
ideas
that
he
had
originated
in
the
telephone
conversation
which
he
also
initiated
leading
up
to
that
meeting.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
oh,
yes,
it
certainly
could
have
been,
yes,
against
colson.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
used
against
colson?
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
the
informant.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
moulton
is
the
defendant
and
colson
is
the
informant.
and,
certainly
it
would
have
been
admissible
against
colson.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
yes.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
yes.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
those
questions
have
to
be
put
back
in
the
context
of
this
meeting
itself.
in
respondent's
brief
at
pages
seven
and
eight,
he
lists
some
of
those
questions
and
when
one
takes
those
questions
and
puts
them
back
in
context,
one
can
see
that
moulton
created
the
situation
that
required
colson
to
ask
him
questions.
for
example,
the
first
question
that
respondent
has
there
on
page
seven
is,
and
this
is
colson,
the
informant,
asking
the
question
and
caps,
who
he
refers
to
is
moulton,
the
defendant--
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
--page
seven
of
the
respondent's
brief.
it
is
the
red
brief.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
and,
colson
asks,
"one
thing
i
cannot
remember,
caps,
just
can't
remember,
i
know
it
was
in
december,
what
night
did
we
break
into
lothrop
ford?
"
"what
date?
"
now,
unto
itself
that
question
might
seem
that
it
is
eliciting
something
that
moulton
didn't
want
to
talk
about.
however,
shortly
before
that
question...
and
that
question
is
on
page
23,
actually
appears
on
page
23
of
the
transcript
of
this
meeting...
on
page
22
of
that
transcript,
shortly
before
that
meeting,
moulton
said
to
colson,
"anyways,
we
have
got
to
get
a
consistent
story
going
on
here
because
our
stories
right
now
are
all
messed
up.
"
so,
what
moulton
did
there
is
he
put
colson
in
a
situation
where
colson
had
to
get
the
facts
straight,
they
had
to
get
the
facts
straight
between
the
two
of
them,
just
so
they
would
be
able
to
develop
their
perjured
testimony.
this
is
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
elsewhere
in
the
meeting
moulton
accuses
colson,
moulton
accuses
colson...
he
says,
"you
don't
know
what
to
say.
"
"you
don't
know
what
to
lie
about
and
what
to
not
lie
about.
"
and,
he
is
accusing
colson
of
that
when
colson
had
his
initial
interview
with
the
police
and
the
inference
or
what
is
actually
being
said
there
is
we
have
got
to
get
the
facts
straight
on
this
so
we
can
go
ahead
and
develop
our
perjured
testimony.
and,
there
are
other
situations
where
moulton
also
puts
colson
in
this
situation.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
no,
the
state
did
not
tell
him
to
do
that.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
moulton
set
up
the
meetings.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
yes.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
they
told
him
to
act
like
himself,
converse
normally,
and
avoid
trying
to
draw
information
out
of
moulton.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
correct.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
yes.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
yes.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
no,
he
had
not.
i
might
add
though
here
that--
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
--yes,
the
defendant
was
talking
to
an
agent
of
the
state,
yes.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
but,
there
is
no
problem
with
that
unto
itself.
in
brewer
versus
williams,
one
of
the
massiah
progeny,
the
court,
in
fact,
said
that
no
constitutional
protection
would
apply
simply
because
the
defendant
is
making
statements
to
an
agent
of
the
state
as
long
as
there
is
no
interrogation.
what
the
state
is,
in
fact,
contending
here
is
that
there
was
no
interrogation.
i
would
add
as
well
that
the
reason
the
police
put
the
body
wire
on
colson
was
to
investigate
this
proposed
murder.
now,
the
police
had
every
obligation
to
investigate
that
murder
because
somebody
else...
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
key
state's
witness,
his
life
was
at
stake.
the
police
had
a
responsibility
to
investigate
that.
and,
what
the
police
were
trying
to
do
with
colson
was
to
use
him
to
investigate
the
murder
while
simultaneously
having
him
avoid
interrogating
the
defendant
regarding
the
underlying
theft
charges.
on
the
other
hand,
colson
was
entitled
to
protect
his
cover
as
an
informant,
therefore,
he
had
to
play
along
with
whatever
moulton
had
arranged
for
this
meeting
simply
to
be
able
to
protect
his
cover.
and,
the
state's
position
is
that
the
questions
that
colson
asked
were
questions
that
he
was
required
to
ask
in
order
to
be
able
to
go
along
with
the
defendant's
own
plans
to
develop
this
perjured
testimony.
i
would
add
as
well
that
some
of
the
incriminating
statements...
and
this
is
just
further
evidence
that
moulton
created
his
own
incriminating
situation...
that
some
of
these
incriminating
statements
were
made
without
any
questioning
or
prompting
by
colson
at
all.
so,
certainly
they
are
not
the
result
of
interrogation
and
they
should
not
be
subject
to
any
massiah
challenge.
there
is
another
factor
here
that...
well,
the
maine
supreme
court,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
they
used
the
test
of
foreseeability
to
find
a
massiah
violation.
the
problem
with
that
test
though
is...
defendants
and
informants,
just
by
the
nature
of
informants,
it
is
generally
going
to
be
foreseeable
that
defendants
and
informants
when
they
get
together,
that
the
defendant
might
be
making
incriminating
statements.
that,
however,
does
not
mean
that
the
government
has
created
a
confrontation
with
the
defendant.
in
fact,
it
is
the
very
foreseeability
of
those
statements,
that
just
when
a
defendant
and
informant
gets
together
or
a
defendant
and
co-defendant
gets
together
to
talk
about
their
case
that
there
might
be
incriminating
statements
made.
it
is
the
very
foreseeability
of
that
situation
which
means
that,
indeed,
the
government
hasn't
done
anything
to
try
and
elicit
those
statements.
so,
although
the
maine
supreme
court
used
this
test
of
foreseeability,
the
state's
position
is
that
it
is
the
very
foreseeability
of
those
statements
that
indicates
that
this
was
not
a
government-created
confrontation.
now,
there
is
the
presence
of
the
body
wire
itself
here.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
yes,
it
is,
because
the
should-have-known
aspect
of
the
maine
court
standard
seems
to
get
away
from
the
fact
of
whether
the
police
were
actually
deliberately
going
after
statements
on
the
theft
charges.
and,
the
sixth
amendment
standard
is
that
deliberateness.
the
test
which
the
maine
court
applied
sounds
more
like
an
objective
test
that
would
be
more
akin
to
rhode
island
versus
innis
and
the
statement
that
is
used
for
custodial
interrogation
under
miranda.
and,
this
court
has
already
said...
it
said
it
in
a
footnote,
i
believe,
in
rhode
island
versus
innis,
that
when
you
are
talking
about
sixth
amendment
deliberate
elicitation
and
fifth
amendment
interrogation,
they
are
really
two
separate
concepts,
because
when
you
are
talking
about
fifth
amendment
custodial
interrogation,
you
are
talking
about
the
pressure
that
is
already
put
on
the
defendant
that
is
inherent
in
a
custodial
situation.
therefore,
anything
which
the
police
do
which
they
should
have
known
about
that
would
prompt
any
statements
the
police
are
going
to
be
taxed
for.
however,
in
the
sixth
amendment
context,
we
really
are.
we
are
talking
about
deliberate
actions
by
the
police
that
actually
destroy
the
adversary
aspects
of
the
trial
itself,
that
destroy
the
right
to
counsel
that
is
available
for
trial
and
that,
in
fact,
reduces
the
trial
itself
to
a
formality.
so,
in
the
sixth
amendment
context,
we
really
are
looking
at
have
the
police
done
anything
intentional.
and,
the
state's
position
is
that
the
combination
of
the
two
factors
that
we
have
in
this
case,
moulton
himself,
not
the
police,
created
this
incriminating
situation.
good
faith
investigation
of
the
police
shows
that
the
police
here
did
not
intentionally
create
the
situation.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
the
state's
position
is--
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
--is
that
the
majority
opinion?
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
well,
mealer
versus
jones
was
incorrectly
decided
from
the
state's
point
of
view,
because
there...
once
again
the
government
did
not
create
the
confrontation.
if
i
recall
the
facts
of
that
case
correctly,
it
was
actually
the
defendant
who--
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
--yes.
and,
that
is
exactly
the
facts--
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
--correct.
and,
that
is
exactly
the
facts
that
we
have
here,
because
in
our
case
the
police
also
knew
and
chief
keating
of
the
belfast
police
department,
he
says
that.
he
knew
that
these
things
were
going
to
be
discussed,
but
he
hadn't
done
anything
to
bring
that
discussion
about.
he,
in
fact,
says,
and
it
is
in
the
suppression
hearing,
they
were
going
to
discuss
anything
and
everything.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
he
got
himself--
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
--to
investigate
the
murder
and
he
was
obligated
to
investigate
the
murder
and
we
have
the
finding
below
that
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
body
wire,
to
investigate
the
murder.
so,
just
because
the
police
themselves
were
aware
of
what
was
going
to
happen,
that
doesn't
mean
that
they
have
actually
created
the
confrontation.
they
have
to
create
the
confrontation
for
there
to
be
a
sixth
amendment
violation.
i
would
also
add
that
the
presence
of
the
body
wire
itself
does
not
unto
itself
indicate
a
sixth
amendment
violation.
if
anything,
the
police
would
not
have
wanted
to
make
a
perfect
record
of
this
meeting
and
memorialized
it
through
a
body
wire
and
tape
recording
if
they
were,
in
fact,
planning
to
violate
moulton's
constitutional
rights
by
gathering
evidence
on
the
pending
theft
charges.
they
would
not
have
wanted
to
do
that.
they
were
investigating
murder.
now,
because
of
the
factors,
the
two
factors
that
i
have
been
emphasizing
here,
this
case
is
distinguishable
from
henry.
in
henry,
the
court
found
that
the
government,
through
its
contingency
arrangement
with
the
informant
and
through
henry's
custody,
had
created
a
confrontation
with
henry
and
the
court
found
no
evidence
that
henry
himself
had
created
his
incriminating
situation.
here,
however,
there
is
ample
evidence
that
moulton
at
every
turn
created
his
incriminating
situation.
as
between
moulton
and
colson,
moulton
was
the
moving
party
throughout
this
entire
relationship.
as
i
have
said,
some
of
moulton's
statements
at
the
meeting
were
made
without
any
questioning
by
colson
at
all
and
even
those
statements
that
he
made
in
response
to
colson's
questions,
that
colson's
questions
were
simply
within
the
role-playing
that
moulton
had
set
up.
i
have
already
given
some
illustrations.
i
would
just
like
to
go
back
to
the
third--
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
--that
would
be
a
more
difficult
case.
massiah,
however,
might
still
be
inapplicable
because--
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
--we
are
relying
on
both
of
those
factors
in
this
case.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
we
are
not
just
relying
on
one
or
the
other.
we
are
relying
on
the
two
of
them
together.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
and,
the
reason
for
that
is
because
the
good-faith
investigation
itself
into
the
new
crime,
that
is
what
they
used
the
body
wire
for,
that
helps
to
show
that
they
were
not
actually
eliciting
or
creating
any
situation
with
regard
to
the
old
crime.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
no,
there
were
no
charges
brought
on
the
new
crime.
as
i
said
though,
it
is
a
closer
case
though
when
there
is
no
bona
fide
investigation
into
the
new
crime.
and,
i
think
at
that
point
an
important
factor
to
consider
is
the
first
factor
that
we
are
relying
on
here
and
that
is
that
whether
the
police
created
an
incriminating
situation
and
then
other
factors
would
also
have
to
be
looked
at
to
determine
whether
there
is
a
massiah
violation.
at
least
one
other
factor
would
be
what
type
of
instructions
did
the
police
give
the
defendant
at
that
point
and
another
factor,
which
was
an
important
factor
in
henry,
is
did
the
police
give
the
informant
any
incentives
to
deviate
from
their
instructions,
because
the
problem
in
henry
was
that
the
contingent
fee
arrangement
with
the
informant,
in
fact,
gave
the
informant
some
incentive
to
deviate
from
the
instructions
in
henry
which
were
to
avoid
questioning
henry,
because
the
contingent
fee
arrangement
was
that
he
would
be
paid
in
exchange
for
any
information
he
gathered.
but,
that
is
not
this
case,
because
here
the
police
were
investigating
a
new
crime
and
they
did
not
give
the
defendant
any
incentives
to
go
ahead
and
investigate
the
pending
theft
charges.
as
i
said,
the
body
wire
was
to
investigate
the
new
crime.
although
admittedly
there
was
a
deal
here
in
that
charges
were
dropped
against
colson...
that
is
the
new
charge,
not
the
pending
theft
charge,
but
rather
new
charges.
no
new
charges
would
be
brought
against
colson
in
exchange
for
his
cooperation;
that
is
his
testimony
at
the
trial.
that
was
in
exchange
for
his
eye
witness
testimony
at
the
trial,
in
exchange
for
what
he
actually
saw,
what
he
actually
did
with
moulton.
that
deal
had
nothing
to
do
with
actually
a
continuing
investigation
to
gather
evidence
against
moulton
on
the
pending
theft
charges.
the
respondent
also
refers
to
the
fact
that
colson
had
not
yet
been
sentenced
and
that
somehow
this
gave
him
an
incentive
to
go
ahead
at
this
meeting
and
to
ask
colson
a
lot
of
question
to
ingratiate
himself
with
the
police.
i
would
point
out
that
the
record
nowhere
supports
that.
there
was
no
sentencing
deal
here
with
the
informant.
there
was
nothing
said
that
the
informant...
that
the
state
would
recommend
a
lighter
sentence
in
exchange
for
gathering
evidence
on
the
pending
charges.
to
the
extent
that
the
sentencing
means
anything
at
all,
it
means
that
it
gave
the
informant
an
incentive
to
follow
the
police
instructions
precisely,
which
was
to
be
himself
and
avoid
drawing
information
out
of
moulton,
and
also
the
open
sentencing
gave
colson
an
incentive
to
continue
to
do
what
the
police
wanted
him
to
do,
which
was
to
investigate
the
proposed
murder.
those
were
the
incentives
that
colson
had.
so,
the
state's
position
here
is
that,
at
least
for
sixth
amendment
purposes,
there
really
was
no
interrogation
and
there
really
was
no
elicitation;
that
moulton's
incriminating
statements
were
the
product
of
a
situation
which
he
himself
had
created
that
should
not
be
charged
to
the
police.
respondent
says
that
the...
given
the
foreseeability
of
the
defendant's
incriminating
statements
at
this
meeting,
he
somehow
implies
that
the
state
somehow
had
some
duty
to
protect
against
the
foreseeability
of
those
statements,
but
that
is
not
the
case.
the
sixth
amendment
protects
against
government-created
pre-trial
confrontations
in
the
absence
of
counsel.
where
the
defendant
has
created
the
pre-trial
confrontation
through
misplaced
confidence
in
someone
who
is
really
working
for
the
state,
then
the
sixth
amendment
does
not
apply.
the
police
are
not
obligated
to
protect
the
defendant
from
his
own
inability
to
keep
quiet
and
that
is
especially
so
here
where
the
defendant
was
planning
new
crimes
to
obstruct
justice,
perjury
and
murder,
for
which
there
was
no
right
to
counsel
anyway.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
state
would
like
to
make
a
few
points
here.
first,
as
to
those
incriminating
statements
that
moulton
made
without
any
questioning
or
prompting
by
colson
at
all,
in
that
circumstance,
colson,
with
the
body
wire,
was
no
more
than
a
passive
listening
post.
and,
a
passive
listening
post,
the
court
suggested
in
henry,
does
not
unto
itself
constitute
a
government-created
confrontation.
as
to
moulton's
other
incriminating
statements
which
he
made
in
response
to
colson's
questions,
there
colson
was
role-playing
and
as
weatherford
says
he
was
entitled
to
ask
those
questions
in
order
to
protect
his
cover
as
an
informant.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
all
statements.
the
court
below
held
that
all
of
moulton's
statements
at
the
meeting
with
colson
were
inadmissible,
even
those
which
were
made
without
any
questioning
or
prompting
at
all,
simply
on
the
grounds
that
they
were
foreseeable
and
that
a
body
wire
had
been
put
on
colson.
and,
as
the
state
has
already
said
in
its
main
argument,
just
the
body
wire
without
more
does
not
constitute
a
government-created
confrontation.
now,
respondent
points
out
that
colson,
in
the
course
of
this
meeting,
said
i
hope
i
can
make
it
through
this.
colson
was
nervous.
he
was
scared.
he
was
entitled
to
ask
questions
to
protect
his
cover.
he
may
not
have
asked
questions
or
he
may
not
have
played
out
his
role
in
the
same
way
as
some
one
skilled
in
the
law,
but
he
was
still
entitled
to
protect
his
cover
as
an
informant,
especially
insofar
as
the
police
were
using
him
to
investigate
proposed
murder.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
no.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
no,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
he
had
been
an
informant
in
the
past.
now,
as
to
the
statements
that
moulton
made
regarding
the
proposed
murder
itself,
which
were
actually
not
admitted
at
the
trial,
but
those
statements
regarding
the
proposed
murder,
there
the
sixth
amendment
has
not
even
attached
yet,
because
that
is
a
non-charge,
that
is
a
new
crime.
and,
there
would
be
no
problem
with
admitting
those
statements,
because
moulton
had
no
right
to
counsel
for
them
anyway.
a
final
point
that
the
state
would
wish
to
make
and
that
is
what
more
could
the
police
do
in
this
case
to
protect
against
a
massiah
violation?
they
gave
colson
instructions
to
avoid
questioning.
they
did
not...
in
contrast
to
henry,
they
did
not
give
colson
any
incentives
to
go
in
and
deviate
from
their
instructions
and
question.
and,
the
body
wire
itself,
as
i
have
said,
if
anything,
indicates
that
the
police
were
trying
to
comply
with
massiah.
given
the
good
faith
of
the
police
here,
the
deterrent
rationale
of
the
exclusionary
rule
which
is
to
deter
purposeful,
intentional
police
misconduct,
would
simply
be
inapplicable.
if
the
court
does
not
have
any
other
questions--
