mr.
anthony
whitcomb
beardsley
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
following
questions
were
posed
to
perley
moulton:
"i
just
can't
remember.
"
"i
know
it
was
in
december.
"
"what
night
did
we
break
into
lothrop
ford,
what
date?
"
"how
many
times
did
we
drill
them
locks?
"
"remember
when
we
took
the
pickup
truck
out
through
there
and
we
dumped
all
of
that
stuff
off
of
that?
"
"did
you
follow
me?
"
"yes,
you
followed
me
there
or
did
you?
"
"one
thing
we
still
don't
know.
"
"we
stole
the
mustang
on
the
13th
of
december,
we
stole
the
dump-truck
on
the
13th
of
january.
"
"how
many
holes
did
you
drill?
"
the
state
is
trying
to
say
that
those
questions
are
not
deliberate
and
that
those
statements
are
not
interrogation.
those
statements
came
after...
those
questions
came
after
the
state's
agent,
gary
colson,
whispered
into
him
microphone,
i
hope
i
can
go
through
with
this.
those
questions
came
after
the
defendant,
perley
moulton,
had
disclaimed
this
new
crime
that
they
were
investigating,
saying
that
it
wouldn't
work.
the
state
would
have
you
believe
that
as
soon
as
perley
moulton
on
his
own
voluntarily
walks
into
the
police
agent's
home,
that
the
police
agent
should
not
come
under
constitutional
scrutiny
for
his
actions.
and,
we
feel
that
this
type
of
action
which
the
state
agent
did
was
deliberately
eliciting
questions.
there
is
no
question
that
the
police
agent
was
surreptitious.
there
is
no
question
that
he
was
not
a
passive
listener.
there
is
no
question
that
the
questions
related
specifically
to
the
crimes
for
which
the
defendant
was
under
indictment.
mr.
anthony
whitcomb
beardsley
i
use
that
word
because
that
is
the
term
that
is
in
the
massiah
case
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
police
agent
got
certain
evidence
out
of
the
defendant
and
it
clearly
applies
in
this
case.
mr.
anthony
whitcomb
beardsley
if
this
is
a
legitimate
new
crimes
investigation,
perhaps
that
evidence
could
be
used
on
some
potential--
mr.
anthony
whitcomb
beardsley
--that
is
correct.
mr.
anthony
whitcomb
beardsley
the
new
crimes...
the
state
of
maine
found
that
this
was
a
new
crimes
investigation.
i
will
support
their
finding.
i
think
that
the
state's
position
is
that
this
is
a
new
crimes
investigation
with
fringe
benefits
that
they
knew
about
ahead
time.
and,
those
fringe
benefits
were
that
they
knew
that
perley
moulton
was
going
to
be
there
and
that
these
questions
would
be
elicited.
the
agent
had
every
reason
to
elicit
these
questions.
the
agent
had
not
performed
for
the
police
up
to
that
point.
he
had
tried
these
telephone
taps
and
no
evidence
had
come
out
incriminating
the
defendant.
he
had
entered
in
this
initial
interrogation
where
the
defendant
totally
disclaimed
this
new
crimes
investigation
and
the
agent's...
his
credibility
was
at
stake.
he
hadn't
performed.
he
had
a
deal
that
he
was
to
cooperate
and
he
indicated
that
he
was
only
told
to
act
normally.
the
agent,
when
he
testified,
said
he
wasn't
instructed
as
to
anything
else,
just
to
act
normally.
and,
he
proceeded
to
draw
incriminating
statement
after
incriminating
statement
out
of
the
defendant.
and,
if
the
state...
i
think
the
state
has
to
be
responsible...
i
think
they
have
to
be
responsible
for
the
acts
of
their
agents.
the
agent
is
an
arm
or
the
state
and
a
task
has
to
be
set
up,
instructions
have
to
be
very
definite,
because
this
investigation
as
to
whether
it
is
a
new
crime
or
an
old
crime
can
get
very
confusing.
that
is
why
the
state
has
to
be
very
clear
in
instructing
their
agent
not
to
do
exactly
what
gary
colson
did
in
this
case.
they
didn't
take
that
protection.
mr.
anthony
whitcomb
beardsley
the
state--
mr.
anthony
whitcomb
beardsley
--the
state
perhaps
could
use
statements
regarding
the
new
crime
if
the
trial
judge
found
that
they
were
not
prejudicial
or
constituting
uncharged
misconduct,
something
along
those
lines.
i
think
what
the
state
is
trying
to
do
here
is
getting
through
the
back
door
from
their
agent
what
they
could
not
do
themselves
directly.
they
knew
perley
moulton
has
expressed
his
right
to
remain
silent
and
they
knew
that
he
had
a
lawyer
and
they
knew
that
this
matter
would
be
discussed.
i
think
what
the
maine
supreme
court
said
was,
yes,
it
was
a
new
crimes
investigation,
but
also
he
was
not
a
passive
listener.
he
took
an
active
role.
and,
the
state
took
advantage
of
the
situation
where
the
agent
and
the
defendant
were
good
friends,
got
together
regularly
anyway,
and
took
advantage
of
that
situation.
and,
where
they
knew
that
this
would
be
discussed
they
should
have
been
explicit
in
telling
their
agent
not
to
ask
any
questions
regarding
the
pending
crime.
and,
what
they
are
doing
is
they
are
just
cutting
their
agent
loose
and
say
go
to
it,
because
if
perley
moulton
voluntarily
comes
to
your
home,
anything
goes,
and
that
is
what
the
state
is
arguing
here.
mr.
anthony
whitcomb
beardsley
approximately
three
months
prior
to...
well,
at
the
very
beginning
of
november,
he
went
to
the
police
and
these
statements
took
place
the
day
after
christmas.
there
had
been
numerous
conversations
with
the
police
by
gary
colson.
they
had
forgiven
him
for
a
class
a--
mr.
anthony
whitcomb
beardsley
--that
is
correct.
mr.
anthony
whitcomb
beardsley
he
sure
could
have
and
he
did
and
the
trial
court
didn't
believe
a
word
he
said
because
all
the
other...
the
other
charge
that
was
related,
perley
moulton
was
found
not
guilty
on
and
the
evidence
they
had
was
colson's
testimony.
mr.
anthony
whitcomb
beardsley
the
burglary
and
theft
charge.
mr.
anthony
whitcomb
beardsley
yes,
and
he
did.
mr.
anthony
whitcomb
beardsley
i
don't
believe
it
was
the
earlier
statements
that
he
testified
to.
i
think
he
testified
about
the
earlier
acts
that
he
was
present--
mr.
anthony
whitcomb
beardsley
--in
your
fact
situation,
perhaps
not,
but
in
this
fact
situation--
mr.
anthony
whitcomb
beardsley
--the
continued
wire
taps,
the
deal
to
cooperate
and
the
taking
advantage
of
their
situation
as
far
as
they
did.
the
police
knew
it
was
going
to
happen
and
they
encouraged
it.
mr.
anthony
whitcomb
beardsley
it
is
my
understanding
that
colson
went
on
his
own
at
the
beginning
to
the
chief
of
police.
the
police
gave
colson
the
wire
tap
and
said,
let
us
know
when
you
record
some
information
and
he
took
it
in.
they
fitted
him
with
the
body
wire.
they
had--
mr.
anthony
whitcomb
beardsley
--colson?
mr.
anthony
whitcomb
beardsley
he
returned
telephone
calls.
he
continued
on
in
this
relationship
after
defendant
had
made
a
motion
to
sever
that
was
opposed
by
the
state
arguably
while
colson
was
an
agent
of
the
state,
and,
all
of
this
preparation
and
topping
it
off
with
these
questions
which
have
nothing
to
do
about
the
new
crimes
investigation--
the
new
crimes
investigation
on
this
murder,
perley
moulton
said
it
wouldn't
work
and
they
joked
about
poison
darts
from
soldiers
of
fortune
magazine.
mr.
anthony
whitcomb
beardsley
i
don't
think
that
there
is,
but
that
is
a
lot
different
situation
than
we
have
here.
mr.
anthony
whitcomb
beardsley
i
agree.
i
don't
think
that
that
situation
alone...
but,
where...
the
only
thing
that
could
be
wrong
with
that
is
that
the
state
would
be
taking
advantage
of--
mr.
anthony
whitcomb
beardsley
--that
is
correct.
but,
i
am
saying
arguably
in
that
case
you
are
correct
that
that
evidence
might
be
admissible.
mr.
anthony
whitcomb
beardsley
well,
in
this
case,
they
are
taking
advantage
of
the
fact
that
colson
and
moulton
have
a
common
peril.
mr.
anthony
whitcomb
beardsley
no,
there
isn't,
but
there
is
something
that
says
that
the
state
cannot
deliberately
elicit
incriminating
statements
from
an
indicted
defendant
and
that
is
exactly
what
they
have
done.
these
questions
are
clear--
mr.
anthony
whitcomb
beardsley
--in
my
situation.
if
they
went
to
the
elks'
lodge
and
colson
came
up
to
moulton,
after
having
spoken
with
the
police,
and
continued
to
press
detail
after
detail,
it
would
be
getting
a
little
less
clear
in
that
situation.
in
this
case,
it
is
clear.
colson
is...
after
this
new
crimes
investigation
has
gone
by
the
board
is
deliberately
interrogated
and
is
asking
specific
questions
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
new
crimes
investigation.
mr.
anthony
whitcomb
beardsley
i
think
that
the
state
has
to
be
responsible
for
the
actions
of
their
agents.
the
agent
is
an
extension
of
the
state.
i
feel
that--
mr.
anthony
whitcomb
beardsley
--well,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
colson
had
a
lot
at
stake
and
they--
mr.
anthony
whitcomb
beardsley
--well,
you
have
got
something
similar
to
the
contingency
fee
agreement
in
that
case
where
colson
is
facing
sentencing,
he
has
got
to
produce
and
he
hasn't
produce.
they
are
letting
him
walk
on
charges
that
carry
with
it
a
potential
25
years
in
jail
and
he
hasn't
produced.
and,
when
moulton
totally
disclaims
this
new
crimes
that
they
are
investigating,
he
is
saying
into
his
microphone,
i
hope
i
can
go
through
with
this,
when
moulton
is
out
of
the
room,
and
he
comes
back
in
and
the
first
words
out
of
his
mouth
are
what
night
did
we
break
into
lothrop
ford,
what
date?
and,
he
continues,
question
after
question
after
question
on
the
old
crime.
and,
the
state
argues
that
this
evidence
would
have
come
out
in
the
regular
course
of
events
and
that
is
absurd.
moulton--
mr.
anthony
whitcomb
beardsley
--i
think
that
the
state
is
under
an
obligation
to
instruct
their
agent
so
that
type
of
interrogation
won't
happen.
and,
if
they
choose
an
agent
that
is
going
to
interfere
with
the
defendant's
constitutional
rights,
then
that
evidence
should
be
excluded.
mr.
anthony
whitcomb
beardsley
in
a
legitimate
new
crimes
investigation,
yes.
mr.
anthony
whitcomb
beardsley
a
new
crimes
investigation
with
fringe
benefits
that
the
state
knew
about.
mr.
anthony
whitcomb
beardsley
yes.
but,
the
evidence
that
he
said...
i
am
not
sure
that
all
of
the
evidence
he
said
in
the
murder
investigation
could
have
been
brought
against
him.
mr.
anthony
whitcomb
beardsley
that
is
correct.
thank
you
very
much.
