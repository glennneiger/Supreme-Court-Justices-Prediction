mr.
moss,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
that
evidence
had
been
used
against
moulton
in
the
trial
on
his
initial
charge,
would
it
have
been
admissible?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
there
were
incriminating
materials,
could
it
have
been
used
against
colson
on
his
first
charge?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
it
was
obtained
afterward?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
colson,
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
maybe
i
have
got
my
parties
mixed
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
colson
went
to
the
chief
of
police,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
said
he
was
threatened
and
wanted
some
protection
among
other
things.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
superior
court
made
an
express
finding
that
he
was
to
avoid
trying
to
draw
information
out
of
moulton.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
different
from
massiah
or
henry.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
beardsley?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
may
i
ask
you
a
hypothetical
extension
on
these
facts?
suppose
in
the
conversation
colson
said
let's
get
together
tomorrow
and
moulton
said,
no,
i
can't
do
it,
i
am
going
to
washington
to
shoot
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
then
he
asked
how
he
is
going
to
do
that
and
he
explains
in
detail
how
he
is
going
to
do
it,
with
a
camera
that
is
a
concealed
gun.
now,
would
this
conversation
be
admissible
in
a
charge
against
moulton
for
threatening
the
president
of
the
united
states?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
was
exploring
your
view
of
the
matter.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
who
initiated
the
conversation
between
the
chief
of
police
and
colson
after
moulton
had
talked
to
colson?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
moss?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
