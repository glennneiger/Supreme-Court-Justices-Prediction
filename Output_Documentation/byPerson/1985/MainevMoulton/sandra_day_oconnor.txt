do
you
think,
counsel,
that
the
maine
supreme
court
knew
or
should
have-known-standard
is
really
any
different
from
creating
a
situation
likely-to-induce
standard
in
the
henry
case?
justice

o'connor
well,
mr.
beardsley,
both
the
trial
court
and
the
maine
supreme
court
agreed
that
the
state
had
a
legitimate
purpose
in
mind
in
investigating
a
new
offense
when
it
wired
mr.
colson
for
sound.
do
you
think
that
there
is
any
deterrent
effect
on
the
police
in
excluding
mr.
moulton's
statements
under
those
circumstances?
if
the
police
have
a
legitimate
purpose
in
wiring
mr.
colson
for
sound
to
investigate
for
a
new
offense,
what
deterrent
effect
would
it
have
to
try
to
exclude
the
statements
that
moulton
makes?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
trying
mr.
moulton
for
the
original
offense?
