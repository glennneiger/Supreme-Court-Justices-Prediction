justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
one
question,
general
moss?
is
the
fact
that
there
was
an
investigation
of
an
attempted
murder
critical
to
your
first
argument?
supposing
the
informant
had
come
in
and
said
i
know
the
defendant
wants
to
come
in
and
talk
to
me
about...
to
get
ready
for
the
trial
and
all
the
rest
of
it,
do
you
want
to
put
a
wire
on
me
and
i
will
just
go
in
and
listen
to
what
he
says.
would
you
say
massiah
applied
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
it
would
be
a
more
difficult
case.
i
can't
really
tell
whether
your
first
argument
also
relies
on
the
fact
that
there
was
a
bona
fide
reason
for
the
wire
apart
from
investigating
the
pending
charge.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
refer
to
the
investigation
of
the
new
crime.
were
there
ever
charges
brought
on
the
new
crime?
