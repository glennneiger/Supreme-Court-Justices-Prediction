justice

if
colson
did
ask
some
questions
and
he
elicited
responses,
did
the
state
tell
him
to
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
set
up
the
meeting?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
state
did
put
a
wire
on
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
they
didn't...
what
did
they
tell
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
they
didn't
instruct
him
to
ask
questions?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
your
state
foreheld
that
it
could,
didn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
did
he
become
a
government
agent,
colson?
not
a
date,
but...
it
wasn't
until
when?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
there
were
a
lot
of
conversations
between
moulton
and
colson
before
even
you
would
claim
he
was
an
agent
of
the
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
i
suppose
those
statements
would
then...
colson
certainly
could
have
taken
the
stand
and
talked
about
them
himself.
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
he
could
have
testified
as
to
the
robbery
charge.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
the
earlier
statements
were
not
excluded?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
if
the
state
had
just
said...
if
he
had
gone
to
the
police
and
said...
suppose
there
wasn't
any
murder
problem
at
all,
no
question
about
a
new
crime
at
all,
and
colson
just
comes
to
them
and
says
here
is
what
moulton
is
telling
me
to
do,
to
testify
to,
and
the
police
said,
well,
we
are
glad
to
listen
to
you.
if
you
have
got
anything
else
to
say
some
time,
well,
come
on
back.
well,
he
does
come
back.
now,
is
that
enough
to
make
him
an
agent
of
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
wire
makes
the
difference?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
never
set
up
any
meetings?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
there
was
just
no
question
at
all
but
what...
the
state
had
instructed
him
not
to
ask
any
questions,
but
he
did
anyway.
is
the
state
responsible
for
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
know
why
you
keep
calling
him
an
agent.
all
the
state
did...
i
don't
think
the
wire
adds
anything
particular.
all
the
state
said
was
keep
us
advised.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
may
be
so.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
say
the
state,
even
though
they...
on
the
assumption
that
they
instructed
him
not
to
ask
questions,
the
state
is
still
disentitled
to
have
responses
to
questions
that
colson
nevertheless
asks?
justice
byron
r.
white
although
you
agree
the
state
certainly
could
have
instructed
him
to
ask
the
questions
about
the
murder?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
this
was,
which
you
agree
it
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
they
had
indicted
him
for
this
murder,
everything
he
said
about
the
murder
could
have
been
admitted
against
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
could
have
been
indicted
for
murder
and
he
was
on
trial
for
murder,
you
could
have
used
the
statements
and
after
that
they
try
him
for
the
robbery,
they
couldn't
have
used
the
statements?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
the
court
below
hold
was
inadmissible,
just
the
responses
to
interrogation
or
what,
or
all
statements?
