mr.
frank
c.
woodside,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
in
order
to
understand
the
pendent
and
federal
question
jurisdictional
issues
involved
in
this
matter,
it
is
first
necessary
to
briefly
understand
the
history
of
this
litigation.
bendectin
was
a
medicine
manufactured
by
merrell
dow
pharmaceuticals
in
the
united
states
which
was
for
the
treatment
of
morning
sickness
in
pregnant
women.
there
are
several
counterparts.
there
is
canadian
bendectin.
there
was
debendox,
which
is
an
equivalent
product
manufactured
in
scotland.
in
this
particular
instance
the
petitioners
are
scottish
and
canadian
individuals.
the
litigation
involving
the
american
claims
was
originally
consolidated
pursuant
to
multi-district
rules
before
the
honorable
carl
ruben
in
cincinnati,
ohio.
at
approximately
the
same
time
there
were
a
series
of
cases
filed
by
foreign
plaintiffs
which
had
originally
been
filed
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
those
cases
were
transferred
to
1404
transfer,
judge
briotz
to
judge
ruben,
after
the
cases
had
been...
after
the
foreign
cases
had
been
transferred
to
the
southern
district
of
ohio,
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
basis
of
forum
non
conveniens
was
renewed.
that
motion
was
granted
and
subsequently
approved
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
in
a
case
called
ballen
versus
richardson
merrell,
inc.
richardson
merrell,
inc.,
is
a
predecessor
corporation
to
merrell
dow
pharmaceuticals,
and
for
all
intents
and
purposes
they
are
the
same
company.
after
judge
ruben
had
dismissed
the
foreign
cases...
there
were
a
series
of
approximately
12
on
a
forum
non
conveniens
basis...
the
instant
cases
were
filed.
and
they
were
filed
in
state
court
on
september
1st,
1983.
as
i
have
indicated
previously,
one
of
the
plaintiffs
is
from
scotland,
took
debendox,
the
other
plaintiff
was
from
canada
and
took
canadian
bendectin.
in
the
complaints
which
these
two
plaintiffs
filed,
and
by
the
way
they
are
virtually
identical
and
were
filed
by
the
same
counsel,
there
are
six
causes
of
action
asserted.
in
these
complaints
there
is
implication
that
the
drug
which
was
used
was
the
american
version
of
bendectin,
and
the
american
defendant,
merrell
dow
pharmaceuticals,
inc.,
the
american
company
was
the
defendant.
the
fourth
cause
of
action
states
that
the
petitioner
in
the
instant
action
is
liable
for
violations
of
a
breach
of
the
food,
drug,
and
cosmetic
act,
and
that
as
a
result
it
is
presumptively
negligent.
when
those
cases
were
filed,
a
removal
petition
was
placed
of
record,
and
the
cases
were
transferred
to
judge
ruben
in
the
southern
district
of
ohio
for
the
filing
in
hamilton
county,
ohio,
in
the
court
of
common
pleas.
after
they
had
been
removed,
two
things
happened.
one,
the
respondents
filed
a
motion
to
remand,
and
the
petitioner
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
based
upon
the
document
and
forum
non
conveniens.
judge
ruben
ruled
that
the
right
to
relief
asserted
by
the
plaintiffs
in
their
fourth
cause
of
action
depended
upon
application
of
the
laws
of
the
united
states,
and
he
then
determined
there
was
federal
question
jurisdiction,
therefore
overruled
the
motion
of
the
respondent
to
remand
the
cases
and
then
dismissed
the
cases
on
the
basis
of
forum
non
conveniens.
after
that
dismissal,
the
cases
were
then
appealed
by
the
respondents
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
the
sixth
circuit
ruled
that...
actually,
what
the
sixth
circuit
did
is,
they
did
not
take
issue...
i
am
not
saying
they
agreed
with
it...
they
did
not
take
issue
with
judge
ruben's
determination
that
there
was
a
federal
question.
instead
what
they
did
was,
they
stated
that
the
various
causes
of
action,
of
which
there
were
six,
should
be
considered
collectively.
now,
the
first
cause
of
action
in
these
particular
cases
is
a
regular
negligence
cause
of
action
which
alleged
that
merrell
dow
was
negligent
in
the
design,
manufacture,
sale,
and
distribution
of
the
product.
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
that
since
the
fourth
cause
of
action
stated...
strike
that.
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
that
the
sixth...
excuse
me...
the
fourth
cause
of
action
was
a
negligence
action,
a
negligence
per
se
action
in
which
the
respondents
had
stated
that
there
was
negligence
per
se
because
of
violation
of
the
food,
drug,
and
cosmetic
act
of
this
country.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
since
the
first
cause
of
action
was
also
a
negligence
action,
that...
and
since
the
respondents
could
recover
fully
and
completely
for
negligence
on
that
first
cause
of
action,
that
because
of
this
parallel
pleading,
it
was
not
necessary
for
there
to
be
a
resolution
of
the
substantial
federal...
question
of
federal
law
in
order
for
the
plaintiffs
below
to
prevail
on
a
negligence
theory,
and
therefore
it
determined
that
there
was
no
federal
question
of
jurisdiction,
and
reversed
the
decision
of
judge
ruben
and
remanded
the
cases
back
to
the
state
court,
and
then
we
filed
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
now,
it
is
our
position
in
this
litigation
that
the
plaintiff's
right
to
relief
under
the
fourth
cause
of
action
necessarily
depends
on
the
resolution
of
a
substantial
question
of
federal
law.
mr.
frank
c.
woodside,
iii
yes,
sir,
that--
mr.
frank
c.
woodside,
iii
--well,
let
me
respond
this
way.
in
point
of
fact,
the
situation
is,
one
way
to
respond
would
be
to
say
that
the
consideration
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
pleading
alternative
causes
of
action
creates
a
situation
where
there
is
no
federal
jurisdiction
is
not
in
accord
with
the
franchise
tax
board
decision.
see,
what
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
frank
c.
woodside,
iii
--your
honor,
in
all
candor,
i
am
not
certain
i
understand
the
question.
if
you
do
that,
then
the
action
would
be,
if
the
court
of
appeals
reversed--
mr.
frank
c.
woodside,
iii
--oh,
i
understand.
mr.
frank
c.
woodside,
iii
well,
we
don't
know
for
certain.
i
think
they
probably
had
to
to
have
done
that,
although
they
didn't
say
so
in
their
opinion,
because,
your
honor,
if
they
hadn't
done
that,
then
it
would
not
have
been
necessary
to
determine
that
there
were
parallel
claims...
for
instance,
if
they
had
determined
that
the
fourth
cause
of
action
did
not
state
a
federal
claim,
if
they
had
so
ruled,
they
would
not
have
gotten
to
the
basis
for
their
decision.
they
would
have...
so
that
there
was
implied
in
the
decision--
mr.
frank
c.
woodside,
iii
--but
you
see,
your
honor,
under
the
franchise
tax
board
decision,
the
court
has
to
consider
each
of
the
individual
claims
for
relief.
mr.
frank
c.
woodside,
iii
maybe
you
and
i
agree.
i
think
the
situation
is,
if
that
happened,
then
the
case
would
be
reversed
and
the
dismissal
on
the
basis
of
forum
non
conveniens
would
be
reinstated,
which
would
be
fine...
the
forum
non
conveniens
decision
was
never
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals.
see,
but
more
importantly,
i
think,
the
federal
question
involved
here...
there
are
several
federal
questions
involved.
in
this
particular
situation,
where
faced
with
a
set
of
facts
wherein
the
drug
which
was
allegedly
ingested
by
the
two
mothers,
the
drug
which
allegedly
caused
the
problem,
was
not
manufactured,
was
not
distributed,
was
not
sold
by
the
defendant.
it
was
sold
by
independent
subsidiaries.
while
the
plaintiffs
below
allege
that
the
activities
of
companies
in
the
united
kingdom,
scotland,
and
the
activities
of
companies
in
canada
are
subject
to
the
regulations
and
the
statutes
of
the
food,
drug,
and
cosmetic
act,
that,
the
federal
question
there
is
whether
or
not
there
is
then
an
extraterritorial
imposition
on
companies
abroad
of
the
safety
statutes
of
this
country.
mr.
frank
c.
woodside,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
woodside,
iii
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
in
point
of
fact,
we
submit
that
there
are
very,
very
few
situations
in
which
an
allegation
of
negligence
based
upon
a
violation
of
a
safety
statute
would
create
federal
question
jurisdiction.
what
we
state
is
that
the
plaintiff's
right
to
relief
must
necessarily
depend
on
resolution
of
a
substantial
question
of
federal
law.
now,
if
you
take
the
situation
you
have
talked
about,
or
if
you
talk
about
the
numerous
decisions
of
trial
courts
and
courts
of
appeals
and
even
this
court
to
some
extent,
in
which
there
are
allegations
in
the
complaint
of
negligence
based
upon
violations
of
the
safety
appliances
act.
now,
you
see,
the
safety
appliances
act,
for
instance,
it
usually
comes
up,
of
course,
in
fela
cases,
it
is
only
a
factual
question.
the
statutes
are
simply...
there
is
a...
the
law
concerning
them
is
well
settled,
so
the
question
simply
is,
did
the
person
violate
that
statute.
we
don't
have
that
situation
here.
mr.
frank
c.
woodside,
iii
well,
to
some
extent.
what
i
believe
the
case
law
says
is
this.
if
you
have
a
situation
where
there
is
settled
construction,
so
that
really
there
is
left
to
the
jury
simply
a
factual
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
the
statute
was
violated,
then
in
that
situation
we
would
not
take
the
position
that
there
is
federal
question
jurisdiction,
but
in
this
particular
situation
here
you
do
not
get
to
that
question
very
easily.
you
do
not
get
to
the
question
of
what
the
court
should
charge
the
jury
on
because
first
of
all
you
have
got
to
determine
several
federal
questions.
first
of
all,
is
there
an
extraterritorial
application
of
the
food,
drug,
and
cosmetic
act.
second
of
all,
are
foreign
citizens,
citizens
in
this
case
of
canada
or
scotland,
are
they
within
the
zone
of
individuals
who
are
protected?
at
best
their
position
in
that
regard
would
be
tenuous.
mr.
frank
c.
woodside,
iii
absolutely
not,
but
you
see,
in
this
particular
situation,
it
is
alleged
that
merrell
dow
pharmaceuticals,
inc.,
violated
the
provisions
of
the
food,
drug,
and
cosmetic
act,
and
as
a
result
of
those
violations
the
company
is
presumed
to
be
negligent,
a
rebuttable
presumption,
and
that
as
a
result
of
that
violation,
the
plaintiffs
have
sustained
damages.
so
the
first
question
that
must
be
addressed--
mr.
frank
c.
woodside,
iii
--oh,
because
in
the
case
that
he
asked
me
about,
the
law
is
settled.
let
me
go
back
and
pose
a
little
bit
different
situation,
if
i
may,
but
it
is
right
on
point.
in
some
of
the
railroad
cases
involving
the
safety
appliances
act,
it
is
alleged
in
the
complaints
there
are
violations
of
those
acts,
and
as
a
result
of
that
the
defendant
is
liable.
now,
some
of
those
alleged
violations
are
because
the
railroad
cars
don't
have
the
appropriate
coupling
devices,
and
so
the
judge
merely
charges
the
jury...
didn't
violate
this...
we
don't
have
that
situation,
because
here
it
has
to
be
a
judicial
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
the
provisions
of
the
food,
drug,
and
cosmetic
act
even
apply--
mr.
frank
c.
woodside,
iii
--well,
your
honor,
the
problem
is,
you
can't
just
presume
it
applies.
that
is
the
federal
question.
the
federal
question
is
whether
or
not
that
statute
or
the
provisions
of
that
statute
were
applied.
it
is
not
a
mere
factual
situation
where
the
trial
court
can
charge
the
jury.
this
is
a
situation
that
they
violated
the
safety
appliances
act
dealing
with
couplers,
they
are
negligent
because
that
would
be
an
american
case
with
american
companies.
this
is
a
situation
where
we
are
alleged
to
be
liable
for
a
drug
we
didn't
make,
we
didn't
distribute,
and
we
didn't
sell.
and
what
the
plaintiffs
have
really
done
is
export
federal
statutes
to
situations
involving
foreign
countries,
and
in
essence
import
foreign
litigation
and
then
take
the
position
that
merrell
dow,
the
petitioner
in
this
matter,
is
liable
for
violation
of
a
statute
which
it
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with.
mr.
frank
c.
woodside,
iii
your
honor--
mr.
frank
c.
woodside,
iii
--that
is
absolutely
correct.
in
response
to
your
question,
or
your
statement,
let
me
compare
the
first
and
the
fourth
cause
of
action.
the
first
cause
of
action
is
very
simple.
it
does
say
we
are
alleged
to
be
negligent
in
the
manufacture,
sale,
design,
and
distribution
of
drugs.
classic
negligence.
in
the
fourth
cause
of
action,
it
is
stated
that
we,
merrell
dow
has
violated
the
provisions
of
the
food,
drug,
and
cosmetic
act.
as
a
result,
it
is
alleged
that
injury
occurred
because
of
the
violation
of
the
act.
it
doesn't
say
that
because
we
were
negligent
in
manufacture,
sale,
and
distribution.
negligence
per
se
is
not
the
same
as
negligence
in
the
ordinary
sense,
and
therein
lines--
mr.
frank
c.
woodside,
iii
--no,
sir,
i
don't
believe
that
that's--
mr.
frank
c.
woodside,
iii
--no.
mr.
frank
c.
woodside,
iii
no,
but
let
me
tell
you
why.
we
don't...
i
don't
mean
to
be
sarcastic,
but
it
is
our
position
that
the
regulations
don't
govern
this...
excuse
me,
that
the
food,
drug,
and
cosmetic
act
does
not
govern
this
situation,
and
that
since
it
is
not
our
drug,
we
couldn't
be
liable
under
any
circumstances.
nevertheless,
there
are
significant
federal
questions
raised
by
the
complaint,
and
it
is
because
of
the
questions
that
are
raised
by
the
complaint
that
federal
question
jurisdiction
is
proper.
now,
our
position
would
be,
if
this
matter
has
to
be
tried
somewhere,
that
we
are
not
liable,
and
that
there
is
no
presumption
of
negligence,
and
we
didn't
violate
the
statute.
nevertheless,
the
situation
in
which
we
presently
find
ourselves
is,
we
have
to
deal
with
the
allegations
which
are
raised
in
the
complaint,
and
under
the
well
proved
complaint
rule
there
is
in
fact--
mr.
frank
c.
woodside,
iii
--it
might
not
be,
but
let
me
go
back
and
respond
to
the
first
part
of
your
question,
that
first,
where
there
would
be
the
federal
question
would
be,
is
the
canadian
railroad
subject
to
the
fela
act.
now,
if
they
are
operating
in
the
united
states,
they
might
be,
but
this
is...
we
are
not
in
an
analogous
situation.
we
are
not
operating
in
canada.
we
are
not
operating
in
scotland.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
there
is
going
to
be
a
federal
question
raised,
and
the--
mr.
frank
c.
woodside,
iii
--it
depends
on
whether
the
railroad
was
operating
in
the
united
states.
if
the
railroad
was
operating
in
the
united
states--
mr.
frank
c.
woodside,
iii
--if
that
were
the
situation,
i
would
say
there
is
also
a
federal
question
created
there
because
in
order
for
the
plaintiffs
in
that
case
to
recover
they
would
have
to
demonstrate
that
the
fela
or
whatever
the
federal
statutes
would
be
would
be
applicable
to
a
canadian
railroad
doing
things
in
canada.
it
is
that
first
question,
which
would
be
the
federal
question.
mr.
frank
c.
woodside,
iii
your
honor--
mr.
frank
c.
woodside,
iii
--well,
to
some
extent
i
am,
but
the
point
i
want
to
make
is,
it
is
a
small
number
of
cases.
this
is
not
a
situation
where
we
would
be
opening
the
federal
courts
to
a
floodgate
of
litigation.
this
type
of
situation
is
not
going
to
arise
very
often.
now,
let's
assume
in
your
coast
guard
situation
the
question
will
be
whether
the
coast
guard
regulations
apply
to
something
that
happened
in
south
america.
that
might
be
a
federal
question.
this
doesn't
happen
very
often.
for
instance,
in
the
bendectin...
lots
of
cases...
this
is
the
only
time
that
i
know
of
where
these
particular
claims
have
been
made.
mr.
frank
c.
woodside,
iii
in
point
of
fact,
justice,
that
is
probably
a
good
point,
except
for
one
thing.
if
we
do
it
on
a
state
by
state
basis,
we
don't
know
what
the
individual
states
are
going
to
do.
before
it
would
get
reviewed,
it
may
well
be
that
a
good
number
of
plaintiffs
determine
that
they
want
to
file
cases
in
various
state
courts
in
this
country.
without
being
too
sarcastic,
the
united
states
has
become
a
haven
for
foreign
plaintiffs.
we
have
lots
of
situations,
even
in
the
bendectin
litigation,
they
filed
lots
of
cases
here,
and
so
that
what
happens
is,
we
allow
it
to
be
determined
on
a
state
by
state
basis.
some
of
them
may
never
get
to
the
supreme
court,
or
if
it
is,
it
may
be
several
years
down
the
road,
and
during
that
period
of
time
the
floodgates
of
the
state
court
may
have
been
opened.
mr.
frank
c.
woodside,
iii
your
honor,
that
is
quite
correct,
but
in
point
of
fact
we
are
now
before
this
court,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
now
the
time
to
rectify
the
situation
and
determined
that
based
upon
the
franchise
tax
board,
that
we
have
a
situation
where
there
is
in
fact
a
significant
federal
question
involved,
and
there
is
in
this
circumstance
federal
jurisdiction,
because
when
that
happens,
then
the
cases,
the
forum
non
conveniens
decision
of
the
trial
court
will
be
upheld,
and
the
cases
will
be
transferred
back
to
either
canada
or
scotland.
mr.
frank
c.
woodside,
iii
i
believe
there
is,
justice
o'connor.
the
situation
is
this.
in
moore,
for
instance,
you
had...
both
a
federal
and
a
state
statute
were
alleged
to
be
violated.
and
the
situation
there
is
that
you
do
not
end
up
having
a
situation
where
the
right
to
relief
necessarily
depends
on
resolution
of
a
substantial
federal
question.
the
most...
i
didn't
write
down
too
many
quotes,
but
i
will
refer
to
one
in
a
minute.
in
franchise
tax
board,
the
following
language
appears.
"under
our
interpretations,
congress
has
given
the
lower
federal
courts
jurisdiction
to
hear
originally
or
by
removal
from
the
state
court
only
those
cases
in
which
a
well
pleaded
complaint
establishes
either,
one.
"
--the
one
is
mine...
"that
federal
law
creates
a
cause
of
action,
or,
two,
that
the
plaintiff's
right
to
relief
necessarily
depends
on
the
resolution
of
a
substantial
question
of
federal
law.
"
if
you
look
at
moore,
and
if
you
look
at
an
innumerable
number
of
court
of
appeals
and
district
court
decisions,
most
of
them
involving
allegations
of
railroad
liability,
we
very
seldom,
if
ever,
have
the
situation
where
the
plaintiff's
right
to
relief
on
one
of
the
claims
relies
necessarily
on
resolution
of
the
basic
substantial
federal
question.
in
point
of
fact,
most
of
those
cases
are
the
situation
where
you
have
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
a...
there
is
a
factual
question,
was
the
statute
violated,
so
they
never
get
to
the
issue.
mr.
frank
c.
woodside,
iii
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
frank
c.
woodside,
iii
there
are
a
number
of
cases,
some
from
this
court,
dealing
with
what
the
definition
of
substantial
is.
if
something
is
substantial,
that
means
it
is
not
obviously
without
merit,
or
not
foreclosed
by
supreme
court
precedent,
or
not
made
solely
to
obtain
jurisdiction,
for
instance.
it
is,
in
fact,
true
that
you
may
have
to
look
at
this
on
a
case
by
case
basis
with
certain
exceptions.
for
instance,
most
of
the
instances
in
which
this
question
arises
are
on
the
railroad
litigation,
and
i
mean,
i
am
not
a
railroad
lawyer,
but
reviewing
the
cases,
it
becomes
obvious
that
the
courts
have
determined
through
a
period
of
time
that
there
are
virtually
always
only
factual
questions.
you
don't
have
to
reach
the
question
of
whether
there
is
a
substantial
federal
question,
because
the
law
is
well
settled.
i
notice
that
my
little
light
is
on.
with
the
permission
of
the
court,
i
will
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
frank
c.
woodside,
iii
i
have
only
one
or
two
brief
remarks.
on
the
federal...
or
the
private
cause
of
action
issue,
while
we
do
not
believe
that
there
is
a
private
cause
of
action,
and
mr.
chesley
apparently
now
also
so
believes,
nevertheless,
in
the
fourth
and
fifth
causes
of
action
of
the
complaint,
it
has
asserted
that
there
is
in
fact
a
private
cause
of
action.
now,
i
think
the
law
is...
i
think
this
is
accurate...
jurisdiction
is
not
defeated
by
the
possibility
that
the
affirmance
might
fail
to
state
a
cause
of
action.
what
happens
is,
the
court
has
to
first
say,
yes,
we
have
jurisdiction,
and
then
dismiss
the
private
right
claims.
now,
in
the
griffin
case
about
which
mr.
chesley
spoke,
that
is,
the
e.
farrell
case
in
cincinnati,
what
happens
is,
the
court
had
jurisdiction
and
then
struck
those
claims.
in
the
bendectin
situation,
involving
the
use
of
foreign
products
by
foreign
plaintiffs,
the
trial
court,
in
this
case
judge
ruben,
bypassed
the
necessity
of
striking
the
claims
and
simply
dismissed
the
actions
based
upon
the
forum
non
conveniens
doctrine.
he
had
jurisdiction
to
do
that
because
of
the
fact
that
the
plaintiff's
complaints
in
these...
do
in
fact
allege
a
private
cause
of
action.
it
would
not
ultimately
withstand
a
motion
to
dismiss.
nevertheless,
it
was
not
necessary
for
the
court
to
do
that
because
the
court
dismissed
these
cases
based
upon
the
doctrine
of
forum
non
conveniens.
mr.
frank
c.
woodside,
iii
i
believe
the
situation
is
that
if
that
allegation
is
made,
the
court
then
has
jurisdiction
to
determine
that
there
is
in
fact
no
cause
of
action
stated.
yes,
sir,
i
believe
that
is
correct.
mr.
frank
c.
woodside,
iii
well,
let's
look
at
it
the
other
way
around.
the
defendant
could
always
remove
on
that
basis.
mr.
frank
c.
woodside,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
woodside,
iii
so
i
think
that
is
another
reason
why
there
is
in
fact
federal
jurisdiction
here.
mr.
frank
c.
woodside,
iii
forum
non
conveniens,
as
it
did
many
before
and
several
since.
mr.
frank
c.
woodside,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
woodside,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
woodside,
iii
well,
it
would
depend
upon
what
all
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
were.
mr.
frank
c.
woodside,
iii
if
that
were
the
only
allegation
in
the
complaint,
what
in
fact
would
happen
would
be,
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
failure
to
state
a
cause
of
action
would
be
granted
and
the
entire
case
would
be
dismissed.
mr.
frank
c.
woodside,
iii
correct,
and
the
court
always--
mr.
frank
c.
woodside,
iii
--the
court
always
has
jurisdiction
to
determine
whether
or
not--
mr.
frank
c.
woodside,
iii
--there
is
a
cause
of
action
stated.
mr.
frank
c.
woodside,
iii
and
so
the
court
would
have
jurisdiction
to
say,
there
is
no
private
cause
of
action,
therefore
the
lawsuit
is
dismissed.
mr.
frank
c.
woodside,
iii
correct.
that
is
correct.
and
that
is
because
of
the
substantial
nature
of
the
federal
question
presented,
which
is
the
application
of
the
food,
drug,
and
cosmetic
act
to
a
situation
involving
a
drug
which
is
manufactured
by
a
company
other
than
defendant,
sold
by
a
company
other
than
defendant,
in
a
country
where
it
was
manufactured
and
sold
by
other
companies
who
themselves
were
subject
to
their
own
regulatory
scheme,
and
not
to
the
regulatory
scheme
of
the
united
states,
and
the
plaintiffs
themselves
were
foreign
consumers
of
that
product.
therefore
one
of
the
substantial
federal
questions
is,
does
the
federal
food,
drug,
and
cosmetic
act
apply
to
merrell
dow
pharmaceuticals
in
this
particular
situation.
that
is
not
a
factual
question.
that
is
a
significant
federal
question
to
be
determined
in
the
first
instance
by
the
court.
thank
you.
