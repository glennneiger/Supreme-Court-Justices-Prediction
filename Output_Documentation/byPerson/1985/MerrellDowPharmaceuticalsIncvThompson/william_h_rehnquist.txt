justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
seems
to
me
i
can
remember
as
long
ago
as
i
was
in
law
school,
which
is
a
long
time
ago,
reading
a
case
involving
some
sort
of
a
maritime
collision,
but
it
wasn't
an
admiralty
case,
it
was
a
diversity
case
in
a
federal
court,
and
the
claim
was
that
the
operator
of
the
boat
hadn't
steered
the
boat
well,
and
also
that
it
violated
a
coast
guard
standard.
and
there
was
no
thought
in
that
case
that
there
was
any
federal
jurisdiction
other
than
by
diversity.
you
plead
negligence
and
you
say
the
want
of
due
care,
and
you
say
violation
of
a
state
statutory
standard,
you
say
violation
of
a
federal
statutory
standard.
is
your
position
that
every
time
you
invoke
the
violation
of
a
federal
statutory
standard
to
prove
negligence
you
have
stated
a
federal
claim?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
federal
question
jurisdiction
depends
on
whether
the
federal
statute
to
which
you
refer
in
your
negligence
claim
has
a
settled
construction
or
an
unsettled
construction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
woodside,
is
your
answer
to
justice
stevens
hypothetical
about
the
canadian
railroad
that
there
is
or
is
not
federal
question
jurisdiction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
he
says
the
railroad
was
operating
in
canada,
and
it
is
pleaded
that
the
federal
law
applies
in
this
particular
situation
in
canada,
as
i
understood
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
my
example
earlier
about
the
boating
accident,
i
suppose
if
it
was
pleaded
that
the
coast
guard
regulation
applies
even
though
it
is
doubtful
whether
these
waters
are
navigable,
if
one
can
conceive
of
a
pleading
like
that,
that
that
would
make
it
a
federal
question
jurisdiction.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
turning
the
whole
thing
just
into
a
case
by
case
analysis,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
is
also
true
you
may
have
50
different
state
decisions,
and
in
this
country
you
have
probably
12
different
circuit
decisions.
it
is
not
as
if
every
federal
court
case
gets
reviewed
by
this
court.
