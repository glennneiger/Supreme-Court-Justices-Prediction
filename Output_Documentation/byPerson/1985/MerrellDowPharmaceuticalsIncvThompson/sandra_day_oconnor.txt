justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
woodside,
if
it
doesn't
happen
very
often,
then
isn't
that
a
good
reason
to
steer
away
from
saying
it
is
a
federal
question
under
the
assumption
that
we
could
resolve
a
serious
federal
question
by
way
of
certiorari
review
from
the
state
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
woodside,
how
do
you
reconcile
the
different
approaches,
or
can
you,
taken
by
this
court
in
the
moore
decision
and
in
the
smith
decision
and
the
language
subsequently
in
franchise
tax
board?
is
there
some
way
to
reconcile
all
those
cases,
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
put
a
great
deal
of
load
bearing
weight
on
the
word
"substantial"
in
your
argument.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
as
justice
rehnquist
says,
that
would
require
a
case
by
case
review
just
to
answer
that
question.
it
certainly
wouldn't
provide
any
very
clearcut
lines
for
the
practitioners,
would
it?
