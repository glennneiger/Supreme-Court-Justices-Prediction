mr.
stanley
m.
chesley
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
believe
that
justices
rehnquist
and
powell
have
put
the
finger
on
the
issue.
there
is
no
way
to
surgically
excise
two
bendectin
cases
out
from
the
well
established
standard
that
there
need
to
be
either
a
private
cause
of
action,
and
both
sides
admit
that
there
is
no
private
cause
of
action.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
legislative
history
shows
that
that
was
one
of
the
options,
to
give
a
private
cause
of
action
to
fdac,
federal
drug
and
cosmetic
cases,
and
that
was
deleted
by
congress.
so
then
the
question
is,
is
there
a
federal
question,
and
while
my
worthy
opponent
would
like
to
surgically
excise
two
bendectin
cases,
we
cannot
take
case
by
case,
because
historically
there
is
presently
sitting
a
stay
order
on
235
american
cases
in
which
the
honorable
judge
ruben,
after
the
bendectin
trial,
took
the
235
cases
that
could
not
be
removed
because
they
were
residents
of
ohio,
merrell
dow
being
a
resident
of
ohio,
it's
a
1441(b)
scenario.
the
court
took
these
235
american
cases
and
put
them
back
to
the
state
court,
remanded
them
to
the
state
court,
and
has
withheld
his
order
pending
the
determination
of
this
issue.
mr.
stanley
m.
chesley
no,
your
honor,
they
have
not.
what
happened
was,
they
had
gone
to
judgment
in
the
federal
court,
and
after
the
verdict,
judge
ruben
held
sua
sponte
that
the
235
of
them,
there
was
inappropriate
jurisdiction,
and
sent
them
back--
mr.
stanley
m.
chesley
--they
had
gone...
but
he
said
these
are
exempted
from
the
verdict.
he
has
exempted
them
from
the
verdict,
but
has
not
put
his
order
on
pending
the
outcome
of
this
case.
mr.
stanley
m.
chesley
very
lucky.
no
question,
your
honor.
as
a
plaintiff,
i
would
say
to
you
that
it
is
more
than
a
lucky
strike.
the
point
that
i
am
making
is
that
mr.
woodside,
my
opponent,
was
talking
historically,
and
i
am
indicating
here
that
it
isn't
an
issue
of
two
or
three
foreign
cases.
there
is
an
inconsistency.
if
the
position
is
that
the
fdac
does
not
apply
to
canadian
cases
and
scottish
cases,
then
i
think
it
is
inappropriate
to
come
before
this
bench
and
state
categorically
that
it
is
a
federal
issue
because
there
was
a
pleading
of
negligence.
i
would
agree
totally
with
justice
powell
that
it
is
a
negligence
case,
and
that
you
are
talking
about
a
standard
of
conduct
and
a
violation
of
the
fda
is
at
best
a
violation
of
a
standard
which
can
be
introduced
in
evidence
by
experts,
and
is
done
all
the
time.
in
response
to
a
question
by
justice
rehnquist,
i
would
say
as
a
plaintiff's
counsel
there
is
no
way
but
to
open
the
floodgates
of
litigation,
and
just
as
an
example,
the
following
cases
would
then
become
all
federal
issues.
the
safety
appliances
act,
which
is
more.
federal
civil
aeronautics
act,
the
rivers
and
harbors
appropriation
act,
erisa,
just
the
simple
flammable
fabrics
act.
in
other
words,
everyone,
we
are
very
familiar
with
the
flammable
fabrics.
there
is
a
federal
statute.
therefore
every
flammable
fabrics
case
which
would
mention
whether
or
not
there
was
a
violation
of
the
act,
whether
it
met
the
standard,
would
then
be
a
federal
case.
packers
and
stockyards
act,
united
states
warehouse
act,
federal
meat
inspection
act,
urban
mass
transportation
act,
the
ladman
trademark
act,
emission
standards
act
for
automobiles,
and
recently
in
the
agent
orange,
the
second
circuit,
a
case
i
am
familiar
with,
635
fed
2nd
987,
held
that
the
bend
rule,
it
is
fifra,
which
is
the
federal
fungible
insecticide
act,
was
not
an
issue
for
federal,
or
a
federal
substantial
law
issue.
quite
simply,
i
think
that
the
sixth
circuit
addresses
the
issue,
i
think,
very
clearly.
clearly
there
is
agreed
no
private
right
of
action
by
those
injured
by
violations
of
the
fdca,
and
that,
two,
the
plaintiff's
right
to
relief
does
not
depend
necessarily
upon
a
finding
of
a
violation
of
the
fdca,
and
you
could
still
find
negligence,
and
this
is
consistent
with
the
rulings
by
all
other
circuits
and
the
supreme
court.
i
believe
circuits
have
already
addressed,
most
circuits
have
already
addressed...
i
know
the
seventh
circuit
has,
and
other
circuits,
and
we
indicate
that
on
page
13
and
14
of
our
brief,
and
i
don't
want
to
track
our
brief
before
this
court.
i
believe
that
at
best
this
court
would
have
to
take
a
position,
because
i
don't
believe
that
the
court
would
ever
want
to
take
the
position
that
all
of
these
are
federal
acts...
pardon
me,
are
federal
issues
of
law,
every
one
of
these,
because
that
would
be
an
impossible
floodgate
of
litigation.
the
next
question
that
this
court
would
have
to
address
is,
does
this
court
want
to
take
fdac
and
make
it
a
private
cause
of
action,
and
i
do
not
see
anything
in
the
preceding
cases,
whether
it
be
franchise
or
more,
that
would
lead
one
to
believe
that
it
is
the
intent
of
this
court
to
make
the
fdac
a
private
cause
of
action,
and
of
course
this
court
can
change
it,
can
change
that
rule
and
make
it
a
private
cause
of
action.
i
advocate
that
it
should
not.
i
advocate
that
the
state
courts,
whether
it
be
ohio
or
kentucky,
can
clearly
apply
the
law,
and
it
does
not
take
only
the
wisdom
of
a
federal
district
court
to
apply
the
law.
simply
stated,
the
fdac
is
a
very
simple
statute.
misbranding
is
misbranding,
and
the
best
example
i
can
give
you
is
that
ohio
has
an
exact
parallel
statute
on
misbranding
which
is
word
for
word.
i
would
suggest
or
submit
that
not
only
would
it
open
the
floodgates,
as
we
have
indicated,
but
it
would,
i
believe,
create
an
impression
that
of
course
merrell
would
like.
it
would
create
an
impression
that
any
and
all
federal
drug
cases
must
or
become
dominanted
by
a
federal
court.
i
suggest
that
from
the
recent
cases
i
have
had
an
opportunity
to
review,
the
intention,
because
of
the
backlog
of
the
federal
judiciary,
is
not
to
encumber
federal
trial
judges
with
more
litigation,
what
with
title
7,
social
security
cases,
speedy
trial
act
cases,
not
to
encumber
the
federal
court
with
more
cases,
because
i
think
as
succinctly
stated
on
the
last
page
of
our
brief,
and
i
would
indicate
that
i
think
it
is
very
well
stated
by
ms.
smith,
who
wrote
that
portion,
on
the
point
that
you
would
have
a
situation
whereby
every
time
there
was
an
allegation
of
a
federal
violation
or
a
federal
statute,
then
the
defendants
could
remove
it
to
federal
court
if
they
didn't
have
diversity,
and
likewise,
every
plaintiff
could
dress
up
a
federal
violation
and
make
it
a
federal
case.
mr.
stanley
m.
chesley
what
would
happen,
your
honor,
the
only
place
they
could
sue
for
misbranding
as
a
practical
consideration
would
be
in
the
state
of
ohio,
because
they
would
remove
the
person.
mr.
stanley
m.
chesley
i
am
sorry,
justice
white.
i
don't--
mr.
stanley
m.
chesley
--what
it
means,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
an
individual
plaintiff
cannot
address
that...
does
not
have
a
right,
a
private
right
of
litigation
based
upon
a
violation
of
that
statute.
mr.
stanley
m.
chesley
well,
he
may
use
it
as
a
piece
of
evidence.
mr.
stanley
m.
chesley
i
believe
that
he
would,
your
honor,
under
the--
mr.
stanley
m.
chesley
--i
believe
if
that
is
the
only
thing
you
have,
that
i
am
here
because
they
violated,
you
are
not
protected.
in
other
words,
myself
as
an
individual,
ms.
smith
as
an
individual
does
not
have
a
right
to
sue
on
that
alone,
but
you
certainly
would
have
a
right
to
sue
on
negligence.
mr.
stanley
m.
chesley
yes,
your
honor,
and
the
question
is,
was
it
the
negligence
of
the
misbranding
that
was
the
proximate
cause,
and
in
using
this
evidence,
your
experts
or
whatever,
you
could
utilize
as
a
standard
of
conduct
the
misbranding
statute
under
302
et
sec
of
the--
mr.
stanley
m.
chesley
--if
i
understand
your
question,
yes,
there
is
a
construction
of
the
federal
statute
which
is
part
of
the
evidence
mechanism,
but
as
i
can
give
a
real
true
analogy,
a
case
cited
by
the
plaintiff...
pardon
me,
by
the
defendants
is
a
case
that
we
had,
which
is
the
best
example
of
what
happens
relative
to
private
right.
it
is
the
griffin
case.
it
is
the
e.
farrell.
there
was
a
total
breakdown
in
the
system
of
the
fda.
how
that
could
even
have
been
put
on
the
marketplace
without
it
even
being
looked
at
by
the
fda
is
the
best
example
i
could
give
this
court
of
the
total
breakdown
of
the
system.
yet
our
trial
judge,
judge
spiegel,
in...
and
it
cited
the
griffin
case
in
the
defendant's
brief,
held
that
there
was
no
right
to
come
into
the
federal
court
because
there
was
no
private
right
to
utilize
the
fda.
while
i
disagreed
with
judge
spiegel,
being
on
the
other
side
of
that
case,
that
decision,
i
happen
to
concur
with
him,
and
that
is
my
understanding
of
what
is
meant
by
private
right.
that
in
no
way
precludes
me
from
bringing
the
case
against
the
defendant
in
the
state
court
on
the
same
allegations
of
negligence
as
justice
stevens
indicated.
i
have
nothing
further
in
my
argument.
i
guess
i
am
supposed
to...
i
don't
think
i
have
to
wait
for
the
white
light,
and
unless
the
court
has
any
questions
of
me,
i
think...
it
is
seldom
that
i
am
in
a
position
to
support...
come
as
an
appellee,
but
i
would
support
the
decision
as
written
by
the
sixth
circuit
and
indicate
that
i
believe
that
that
is
appropriate.
