justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
you
there
for
a
moment?
how
does
that
bear
on
the
case?
you
do
not
claim
there
is
a
private
cause
of
action.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
is
that
different
from
the
case
justice
rehnquist
asked
you
about?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
even
if
you
assume
they
do
apply,
where
does
that
get
you?
doesn't
that
just
get
you
to
the
threshold
of
your
safety
appliance
cases
where
everybody
acknowledges
the
statute
applies,
but
proving
a
violation
doesn't
establish
a
right
to
relief.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
not
liable
for
violation
of
the
statute.
it
is
liable
for
negligence
if
it
is
liable
at
all.
isn't
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
you
agreed
a
moment
ago
there
is
no
private
cause
of
action
for
a
violation
of
the
federal
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
if
they
prove
a
violation
of
the
act
and
they
fail
to
prove
negligence,
they
cannot
recover
unless
there
is
a
cause
of
action
under
the
act,
can
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
concede
they
can
recover
for
a
violation
of
the
statute--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--without
proving
negligence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
would
this
be
any
different
than
if
you
had
a
canadian
railroad
or
something
like
that,
and
they
said
you
have
violated
the
federal
safety
appliance
act,
and
we
allege
the
federal
statute
applies
in
canada,
and
that
is
a
federal
question,
and
as
a
result
of
that
violation
we
are
going
to
recover
for
negligence?
why
is
that
case
different?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
woodside,
would
your
bell
v.
hood
argument
go
so
far
as
to
say
every
time
a
plaintiff
alleges
that
there
is
a
private
cause
of
action
on
some
federal
statute,
even
though
it
was
pretty
clear
there
was
not,
that
there
nevertheless
would
be
jurisdiction
to
decide
whether
or
not
that
was
a
good
plan?
i
mean,
if
we
agree
here
there
isn't
any
private
cause
of
action,
you
are
saying,
even
though
we
know
what
the
answer
is,
there
was
jurisdiction
over
the
whole
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
could
always
defeat
removal
by...
i
mean,
as
long
as
that
kind
of
allegation
is
in
the
complaint,
a
plaintiff
could
always
sustain
federal
jurisdiction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
the
plaintiff
is
foolish
enough
to
have
such
an
allegation
in
the
complaint.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
