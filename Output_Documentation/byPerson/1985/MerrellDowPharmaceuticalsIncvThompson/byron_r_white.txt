justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
we
have
to
decide
that
if
all
the
court
of
appeals
held,
as
you
have
said,
is
that
we
do
not
need
to
decide
anything
about
the
fourth
cause
of
action
because
of
the
first,
because
they
could
recover
on
a
state
cause
of
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
apparently
you
wouldn't
be
satisfied
with
our
just
reversing
that
holding.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
it
isn't.
what
if
we
just
reversed
the
court
of
appeals
insofar
as
it
held
that
just
because
there
was
a
state
cause
of
action
stated,
they
didn't
need
to
determine
if
there
was
a
federal
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we
would
just
tell
the
court
of
appeals
it
should
have
decided
whether
the
fourth
cause
of
action
stated
a
federal
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
it
didn't
decide,
did
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
just
don't
understand
that
at
all.
they
could
easily
say,
even
if
the
fourth
cause
of
action
states
a
federal
question,
the
fact
that
there
is
a
first
cause
of
action
stated
in
the
complaint
means
that
there
is
no
federal
jurisdiction.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree
with
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there
is
no
private
cause
of
action
in
this
case
for
misbranding,
which
i
guess
both
sides
agree
that
there
is
not,
may
a
plaintiff
nevertheless
just
go
into
a
state
court
and
sue
for
misbranding?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
no
private
cause
of
action,
and
if
it
were
brought
in
a
federal
court,
there
just
wouldn't
be
any
private
cause
of
action.
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
does
it
mean
that
there
is
no
private
cause
of
action
for
violation
of
this
misbranding
provision?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
he
goes
into
state
court
and
says,
the
defendant
has
violated
this
federal
statute,
this
misbranding
provision,
and
i
want
relief,
he
will
get
dismissed
in
the
state
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
that
is
all
he
says.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
would
be
dismissed.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
which...
you
would
have
a
right
under
state
law
to
sue
for
negligence.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
in
the
state
cause
of
action
for
negligence
based
on
this
misbranding,
it
becomes
clear
that
the
misbranding
that
is
claimed
has
been
held
by
a
federal
court
in
an
action
by
the
food
and
drug
administration
that
this
is
not
misbranding
at
all.
one
circuit
has
held
that
it
is
misbranding,
and
another
circuit
has
held
that
it
isn't,
and
obviously
then
a
construction
of
the
federal
statute
was
involved.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
if
the
suit
had
been
brought
in
the
federal
court
here,
the
federal
court
would
have
dismissed
it
on
what
ground?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
forget
forum
non
conveniens
for
a
moment.
you
just
go
into
federal
court
and
sue
for
misbranding,
and
you
are
going
to
get
dismissed,
aren't
you--
justice
byron
r.
white
--because
there
is
no
private
cause
of
action.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
because
there
isn't
jurisdiction.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
the
only
allegation
there
is,
that
there
was
misbranding,
and
i
want
relief.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
reason
is
because
there
is
no
private
cause
of
action.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
not
a
jurisdictional
ruling,
you
say.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
say
that
this
case
should
not
be
remanded
to
the
state
court
because
even
though
there
is
no
private
cause
of
action
there
was
jurisdiction
to
entertain
this
suit
on
removal.
