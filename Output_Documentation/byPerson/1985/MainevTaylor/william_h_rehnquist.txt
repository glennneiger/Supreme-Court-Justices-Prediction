justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
other
words,
maybe
the
district
court
read
the
standard
under
hughes
to
generously
according
to
the
first
circuit.
is
that
a
possibility?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
your
answer
is
if
they
can
get
one
expert
that
says
it
is
serious,
that
is
enough
to
justify
the
statute
even
though
the
judge
says
i
don't
know
whether
to
believe
him
or
not.
that
is
your
position?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
experts
disagree?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
saying
there
is
no
risk
to
maine's
ecology?
