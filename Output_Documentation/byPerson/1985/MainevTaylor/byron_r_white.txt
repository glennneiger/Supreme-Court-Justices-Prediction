out
of
every

thousand

but
you
would
never
know
whether
you
found
them
all.

do
you
know
of

these
shiners
any
more
dangerous
to
maine
than
they
are
to

do
you
know
of
any
other
state
that

not
very
great?

r.
white
--you
mean
some
diseased
fish
would
cause
more
havoc
there
than
they
would
in

non-fragile
new
hampshire
fishery?
