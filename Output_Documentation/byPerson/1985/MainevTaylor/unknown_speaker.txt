general
howard,
can
i
interrupt
you
for
just
a
second?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
were
reciting
what
witnesses
testified
to.
i
am
sorry.
unknown
speaker
in
your
submission,
do
we
need
to
go
beyond
the
district
court's
written
opinion
to
find
out
what
the
facts
are?
unknown
speaker
what
part
of
the
district
court's
findings
are
you
now
referring
to
just
so
i
can
follow
by
looking
at
the--
unknown
speaker
--well,
wherever
the
district
court's...
they
are
not
numbered
findings
as
we
normally
have.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
does
he
find
that
all
the
testimony
is
true
that
you
describe?
he
does
recite
a
lot
of
testimony.
unknown
speaker
but,
nevertheless,
the
court
believed
judgment
of
another.
unknown
speaker
did
the
findings
of
the
district
court
necessarily
involve
passing
on
the
credibility
of
these
experts?
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
puzzles
me
because
one
of
the
things
he
said
was
that
the
lack
of
agreement
is
not
itself
the
ground
for
taking
one
position
or
the
other.
he,
in
effect,
seemed
to
say
that
there
is
disagreement
among
experts
and
you
need
more
than
that
in
order
to
come
to
the
correct
conclusion.
doesn't
he
say
the
experts
disagree
on
the
issue?
unknown
speaker
correct.
and,
does
he
resolve
that
disagreement?
unknown
speaker
correct.
so,
he
is
saying
that
no
matter
which
one
is
right
the
fact
that
there
is
disagreement
is
enough
to
support
the
reasonableness
of
the
state...
that
is
quite
different
from
saying
that
he
picked
one
set
of
experts
over
the
other.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand,
but
it
is
a
different
argument.
[laughter]
well,
mr.
howard,
this
line
of
questioning
gets
to
a
question
i
have
had
frankly
and
that
is
what
does
the
hughes
case
require,
what
is
the
test
laid
down
in
hughes?
one
aspect
of
it,
as
i
understand
here,
is
that
the
state
has
the
burden
of
establishing
that
no
non-discriminatory
alternative
is
available.
the
district
court,
as
i
understand
it,
said
that
hughes
does
not
preclude
the
state
from
acting
where
the
evidence
on
the
effectiveness
of
such
alternatives
is
in
doubt
and
where
the
potential
disruptive
impact
is
great.
now,
i
read
the
first
circuit's
opinion
as
possibly
disagreeing
with
that
as
a
legal
standard
under
hughes.
and,
if
that
is
the
case,
then
you
have
a
legal
issue
here
to
deal
with
before
you
have
to
grapple
with
the
underlying
facts.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
the
district
court's
articulation
of
this
standard,
that
if
the
evidence
is
in
doubt,
then
that
is
enough
for
the
state?
do
you
think
that
is
correct?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
may
make
sense.
do
you
think
it
is
correct
under
hughes?
unknown
speaker
can
you
buy
baitfish
in
maine?
unknown
speaker
warm
water
bait?
unknown
speaker
yes.
maine
people
do
sell
bait
for
the
purpose...
for
the
same
purpose
that
these
baitfish
were--
unknown
speaker
--of
live
bait
that
is
produced
in
maine.
unknown
speaker
these
were
golden
shiners.
are
golden
shiners
available
in
maine?
are
they
produced
there
for
bait?
unknown
speaker
how
do
they
know
that--
unknown
speaker
--how
do
they
know
that
the
baitfish
produced
in
maine
are
without
bacterial
injury?
there
must
be
some
testing
procedures
then.
unknown
speaker
--how
do
they
know
that
they
haven't
been
if
they
can't
test?
unknown
speaker
that
is
true
of
all
fish.
i
mean,
if
you
were
importing
trout
or
salmon
or
whatever,
you
just
take
a
sample
and
you
kill
the
ones
in
the
sample,
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
say
that
because
these
parasites
have
never
been
found
in
maine
as
far
as
you
know,
that
maine
is
just
lucky
enough
not
to
be
cursed
with
those,
but
they
know
that
other
states,
baitfish
from
other
states
are.
unknown
speaker
and,
you
never
can
tell
when
they
are
or
are
not.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
one
question
about
the
absence
of
testing
procedures
which
seems
to
suggest
kind
of
ends
the
case.
wasn't
the
dispute
in
the
testimony
over
the
question
whether
the
problem
was
sufficiently
serious
to
justify
the
expenditure
and
so
forth
to
develop
testing
procedures?
some
experts
said,
well,
this
doesn't
amount
to
anything
anyway,
so
that
is
why
we
don't
have
tests.
that
is
what
the
conflict
was.
unknown
speaker
do
you
take
the
view
that
if
there
is
disagreement
among
experts
on
whether
there
is
a
serious
problem
or
not
that
that
is
a
sufficient
basis
for
sustaining
the
statute
without
the
judge
finding
that
one
group
of
experts
was
right
as
opposed
to
the
others?
unknown
speaker
we
have
to
look
at
the
underlying
evidence.
we
can't
just
read
the
district
court's
opinion,
right?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
the
court
of
appeals
seemed
to
apply
a
more
strict
standard
under
hughes.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
eggert,
in
the
brief
you
suggest
that
under
a
commerce
clause
analysis
that
clear
and
convincing
evidence
is
the
standard
to
be
applied.
now,
you
are
not
arguing
that
to
us,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
is
just
a
preponderance--
unknown
speaker
--i
am
not
sure
i
understand
your
idea
of
strict
scrutiny
here
which
is
the
kind
of
thing
you
might
apply
under
an
equal
protection
analysis
if
there
were
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race.
we
don't
have
that
there,
do
we?
we
just
have
the
requirements
set
forth
in
hughes
versus
oklahoma
that
we
have
to
apply,
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
under...
in
applying
the
hughes
test,
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
is
free
to
just
speculate
on
other
possible
alternatives
or
does
the
court
of
appeals
have
to
consider
and
rely
on
the
evidence
as
determined
by
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
mr.
eggert,
supposing
that
we
were
dealing
with
district
court
findings
of
just
rather
plain,
ordinary
facts
as
to
whether
there
were
or
were
not
an
adequate
test
for
this
parasite.
now,
if
the
district
court
finds
those
facts
of
particular
weight
and
the
appeal
is
taken
to
the
court
of
appeals,
does
the
court
of
appeals
review
those
under
a
clearly
erroneous
standard
as
it
would
other
findings
of
fact?
unknown
speaker
the
hypothesis
i
gave
you
was
the
kind
of
factual
questions
that
are
classical,
factual
questions
under
any
application
of
rule
52.
you
are
always
going
to
be
applying
law
to
facts.
that
doesn't
set
you
free
from
the
clearly
erroneous
test.
unknown
speaker
well,
no,
i
don't
think
anyone
would
think
they
were.
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
clearly
erroneous
test
or
is
it
something
different?
you
know,
it
is
a
rather
vague
statement.
unknown
speaker
even
diseased
baitfish?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
the
state's
position
of
what
would
happen
if
a
large
number
of
diseased
baitfish
were
imported?
unknown
speaker
what
sort
of
a
problem?
unknown
speaker
and,
your
position
is
it
doesn't
pose
any
problem?
unknown
speaker
was
this
a
subject
of
the
expert
testimony,
one
of
the
subjects
of
the
expert
testimony?
unknown
speaker
meanwhile,
who
is
supposed
to
bear
the
risk?
unknown
speaker
in
these
shiners.
unknown
speaker
maybe
so.
that
may
be
so,
but
it
is
an
undesirable
thing
to
have
them
spread
around,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
you
are
saying
that
it
would
not
be
a
sufficient
threat
to
permit
maine
to
keep
them
out
of
the
state?
unknown
speaker
with
or
without
tests?
unknown
speaker
so,
your
submission
is
even
if
there
is
no
test
maine
has
to
let
them
in.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
this
question?
i
am
confused
at
the
moment.
there
is
a
section
in
your
brief
on
page
25,
the
caption
of
which
says,
"the
court
of
appeals
did
not
sufficiently
consider
the
serious
consequences
to
maine's
ecology
of
invalidating
the
challenged
statute.
"
are
you
representing
the
solicitor
general?
unknown
speaker
i
beg
your
pardon.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
maine
could
just
prevent
bait
fishing
entirely?
unknown
speaker
and,
keep
out
baitfish
from
any
other
states?
unknown
speaker
i
know
they
could
prevent
bait
fishing,
but
do
you
think
could
keep...
they
could
enforce
that
rule
by
preventing
importation
of
baitfish?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think
the
state
is
required
to
go
to
that
length
to
meet
its
reasonable
alternatives?
unknown
speaker
is
your
client
prepared
to
share
its
costs...
share
the
cost
of
sending
inspectors
all
around
the
country?
unknown
speaker
it
is
a
summary.
