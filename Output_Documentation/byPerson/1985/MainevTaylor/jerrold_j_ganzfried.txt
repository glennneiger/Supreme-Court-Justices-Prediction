mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
address
some
of
the
questions
that
came
up
during
the
state's
presentation
and
that
is
that
there
is
no
difference
of
opinion
in
the
record
on
the
fact
of
whether
there
were
may
tests,
inspections,
certification,
or
sampling
procedures
presently
available
to
test
these
fish
for
the
parasites
and
exotic
diseases
in
any
way
other
than
a
total
exclusion.
the
district
court
found
that
the
fact
remains
that
there
is
no
testing
technique.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
find
that
finding
to
be
clearly
erroneous
and,
in
fact,
appellee
taylor
does
not
contest
to
the
contrary.
his
brief
in
this
court
on
page
25
says
simply
that
there
are
procedures
that
could
be
developed.
so,
we
submit
that
what
one
might
ordinarily
expect
would
be
a
less
restrictive
form
of
regulation
in
this
area,
mainly
an
inspection
and
testing
procedure
is
on
the
facts
that
maine
has
proven
in
this
case,
simply
not
available.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
you
can
buy
live
bait
in
maine.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
i
may
not
have
the
technology
correct,
but
if
it
is
from
maine,
if
it
is
not
imported
into
maine--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--mr.
taylor,
the
appellee
in
this
case,
is
a
commercial
bait
salesperson
in
maine.
he
is
an
in-state
seller
of
live
bait.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
that
is
correct.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
i
believe
that
there
is
a
form
of
golden
shiner
that
is
produced
in
maine,
although
as
i
recall--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--it
is
indicated
in
the
brief
and
has
a
different
name.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
yes,
there
are
some
procedures
for
testing.
the
difficulties
with
them
are,
number
one,
that
in
order
to
test
a
fish
you
have
to
kill
the
fish.
once
you
kill
the
fish,
it
is
not
live
bait.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
the
record
indicates,
and
it
is
uncontested
on
this
point,
that
the
parasites,
diseases,
and
predators
that
were
discussed
in
this
case
are
not
native
to
the
state
of
maine
and
have
not
been
previously
found
in
the
state
of
maine.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
to
the
best
ability
that
they
have
with
the
tests...
they
have
no
test
that
they
can
perform
without
killing
the
fish
and,
therefore,
rendering
no
longer
live
baitfish.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
yes.
the
difference
is,
and
the
testimony
in
the
record
reflects
this,
is
that
for
trout
and
salmon,
testing,
sampling,
and
certification
procedures
have
been
developed
and
they
are
regarded
as
reliable.
no
such
procedures
have
been
developed
for
live
baitfish
and
to
the
extent
that
there
are
any
testing
procedures
at
all,
they
are
not
considered
reliable
and
they
often
produce
false
negatives,
so
even...
as
mr.
walker,
the
state
expert,
the
first
witness
in
the
case,
testified,
he
examined
the
fish
in
this
batch
of
158,000
mr.
taylor
was
bringing
in
and
based
on
the
tests
available
to
him,
he
said
even
the
fish
he
killed
and
examined
he
could
not
certify
that
they
were
free
of
these
diseases
and
parasites.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
that
is
correct.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
you
can
sometimes
tell
when
they
are,
but
you
can
never
tell
with
any
reliability
that
they
are
not.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
that
is
right.
and,
the
portion
of
the
district
court's
opinion
to
which
i
referred
to
before
discussing
the
disagreement,
the
district
court
does
indicate
that
he
is
speaking
about
a
disagreement
only
with
respect
to
the
question
of
the
legitimacy
of
a
state
interest
and
not
as
to
whether
there
is
a
less
restrictive
alternative
and
found
that
the
defendant's
expert
agreed
with
prosecution
that
there
is
not
testing/inspection/certification
procedure.
the
district
court's
comment
to
that
disagreement
was
limited
to
the
legitimacy
of
the
purpose.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
find
to
the
contrary
on
the
purpose.
the
district
court
upheld
the
purpose,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
find
that
the
state's
purpose
was
not
a
legitimate
state
purpose.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
we
think
that
the
question
of
whether
the
threat
to
the
state
is
a
sufficiently
serious
one
is
essentially
a
legislative
determination
and
that
the--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--our
position
is
essentially...
the
orderly
way
to
proceed
is
for
mr.
taylor,
if
he
develops
a
test,
which
he
hasn't
done
yet,
to
present
that,
to
present
his
experts,
to
present
his
possibilities
as
to
inspection
and
certification
procedures
to
the
state
legislature.
it
basically
is
our
feeling
that
under
hughes
versus
oklahoma,
there
should
be
sufficient
elbow-room
for
a
state
to
implement
prophylactic
measures
when
the
effect
on
the
state's
ecology
would
be
very
serious
and
there
is
substantial
scientific
basis
for
the
state's
concern.
on
the
question
of
the
state
of
the
record
in
this
case,
i
would
point
out
that
the
defendant's
expert
himself
contradicted
himself
on
the
point.
he
indicated
he
was
the
first
person
to
discover
one
of
the
parasites
that
is
involved
here
and
he
put
a
good
deal
of
study
into
it
because,
as
he
said,
it
was
regarded
as
a
major
problem.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
no.
i
think
the
findings
the
district
court
sustaining
the
legitimacy
of
the
state
purpose
and
according
proper
deference
to
the
state
legislature,
not
substituting
the
court's
judgment
for
the
legislative
judgment,
and
the
findings
of
fact
by
the
district
court,
which
were
not
found
to
be
clearly
erroneous
by
the
court
of
appeals,
but
were
simply
disregarded
by
the
court
which,
as
it
said,
read
the
record
and
"drew
its
own
conclusions".
we
think
that
where
the
court
of
appeals
went
wrong
was
in
substituting
its
finding
of
fact
for
those
of
the
district
court
and
in
substituting
its
judgment
for
the
state
legislature.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
they
articulate
the
hughes
standard
the
same
way,
but
in
terms
of
the
application
of
that
standard
to
the
particular
case--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--the
court
of
appeals
seemed
to
assume
it
was
the
arbiter
of
both
facts
and
state
interest.
and,
under
this
court's
decision,
it
is
neither.
i
have
addressed
the
difficulties
with
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion.
let
me
get
back
to
one
important
point
that
is
a
factual
one
and
that
is
the
uniqueness
of
maine's
situation.
they
do
prohibit
the
importation
of
live
baitfish,
but
if
i
could
draw
an
analogy
to
this
court's
decision
in
philadelphia
versus
new
jersey,
the
situation
maine
was
in
here
is
similar
to
what
new
jersey
would
have
been
in
had
there
been
no
domestic
solid
waste
in
new
jersey.
here,
the
state
of
maine
is
attempting
to
keep
out
and
protect
its
environment
from
that
which
was
not
there
before.
thank
you.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
he
didn't
actually
say
i
hereby
find
so
and
so,
but
i
think--
