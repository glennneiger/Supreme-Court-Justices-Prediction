mr.
e.
paul
eggert
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
taylor
in
the
court
below
has
attacked
the
constitutionality
of
the
state
statute
which
forbids
the
importation
of
baitfish.
he
has
done
that
in
a
fairly
unique
circumstance
of
being
in
the
midst
of
a
federal
criminal
prosecution
and
attacking
a
state
statute.
as
background
for
that
particular
challenge,
mr.
taylor
has
been
in
the
bait
business
for
approximately
17
years.
he
has
raised
in
the
state
of
maine
baitfish
and
mainly
golden
shiners
during
that
period
of
time.
they
are,
indeed,
the
same
type
of
species
of
golden
shiners
that
he
was
attempting
to
import
in
this
particular
situation.
the
reason
mr.
taylor
is
importing
golden
shiners
from
other
states
is
due
to
the
reality
of
aquaculture
in
maine.
maine
has
a
harsh
winter,
a
short
warm
season
during
which
fish
may
be
raised
and
harvested
and
the
fish
selling
cycle
is
just
the
opposite
of
that.
maine
fishermen
can
fish
year
around
with
live
bait,
but
they
do
not
do
so.
mainly,
they
fish
in
winter,
ice
fish
with
live
bait,
and
that
is
the
peak
season
for
mr.
taylor.
it
is
very
difficult
for
mr.
taylor
to
raise
golden
shiners
and
keep
them
over
the
winter
to
supply
the
demand
of
his
customers,
and,
therefore,
in
order
to
remain
in
business
and
to
grow
in
his
business
as
the
demand
of
the
marketplace
dictates,
he
has
been
forced
to
go
outside
the
state
during
winter
months
to
bring
back
in
golden
shiners.
the
initial
question
that
is
before
this
court
as
i
understand
it
is
a
matter
of
jurisdiction
which
has
been
reserved
to
this
hearing.
our
position
on
jurisdiction
is
that
section
<twelve
fifty-four
two>
[=
1254(2)]
is
not
as
clear
cut
as
the
state
would
have
us
believe,
but,
in
fact,
that
particular
statute
does
not
apply
to
criminal
cases,
which
this
is.
it
is
a
criminal
appeal.
and,
that
that
statute
applies
only
to
civil
cases.
that
is
clear
in
the
legislative
history
of
that
statute
and
in
the
very
language
of
the
statute
itself.
that
does
not
mean
that
this
court
cannot
hear
the
merits
of
this
particular
case,
but
that
we
would
contend
that
the
court
must
treat
this
as
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
and
we
would
further
contend
that
this
question
is
not
important
enough
for
the
court
of
grant
that
petition.
all
parties
in
this
particular
case,
i
think,
agree
that
this
statute
that
we
are
talking
about
is
discriminatory.
it
is
a
flat
prohibition
against
the
importation
of
baitfish.
it
stops
it
at
the
border.
what
is
being
prohibited
is
something
that
the
state
allows
all
the
time
to
go
on
within
its
borders.
golden
shiners
are
a
common
baitfish
within
the
state
of
maine
and
outside
the
state
of
maine.
once
this
discriminatory
effect
of
the
statute
has
been
admitted
by
all
parties,
the
constitutional
law
which...
the
body
of
constitutional
law
which
has
surrounded
the
analysis
of
the
statute
indicates
that
the
courts
must
look
at
the
statute
and
the
proposed
justification
for
the
statute
with
strict
scrutiny.
we
would
contend
that
the
district
court,
through
the
magistrate's
findings,
and
also
the
district
court's
findings,
gave
lip
service
to
that
strict
scrutiny
standard
and
said
that
they
were
applying
the
strict
scrutiny
standard
and,
in
effect,
were
merely
adopting
the
opinions
of
the
state's
experts
because
they
really
didn't
have
any
basis
for
distinguishing
between
or
finding
one
expert's
opinion
to
be
more
correct
than
the
others.
they
fell
back
to
the
position
that
the
state
has
proposed
these
problems
as
their
legitimate
purpose.
the
defendants
contest
that,
but
we
are
not
really
sure,
therefore,
we
will
accept
the
state
at
face
value
and
allow
the
statute
to
stand.
we
contend
that
the
court
must
do
more
than
that,
that
the
court
must
not
just
make
findings
perhaps
on
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
standard
or
maybe
even
a
lesser
standard
in
this
particular
case,
as
what
the
court
did,
but
they
must
make
those
findings
and
then
look
and
scrutinize
those
findings
in
the
context
of
everything
else
that
was
presented
in
the
hearing.
i
think
this
court
does,
indeed,
have
to
go
back
to
the
transcript
to
look
at
the
evidence
that
was
presented.
mr.
e.
paul
eggert
no,
i
am
not,
your
honor.
i
think
i
may
have
been
analogizing
that
when
that
is
the
standard
and
the
lower
court...
when
a
clear
and
convincing
standard
is
evidenced
as
the
standard,
and
the
lower
court
has
obviously
misapplied
that
standard,
that
the
appellate
court
then
has
to
look
at
the
record,
the
factual
record,
and
make
a
determination
for
itself
from
that
record
whether
or
not
the
lower
court
is
correct.
mr.
e.
paul
eggert
as
it
pertains,
i
believe,
to
the
initial
findings
of
fact,
but
that
is
not
sufficient
that
the
findings
of
fact
agree
with
the
state's
position.
the
court
must
go
further
than
that
and
apply
those
facts
to
the
statute
and
that
is
where
the
strict
scrutiny
comes
in.
it
is
not
enough
that
the
court
say,
yes,
we
agree,
for
instance,
that
there
is
a
parasite
which
could
be
introduced
into
the
state
of
maine
through
importation
of
baitfish.
it
goes
further
than
that
to
find
out
if
that
is
a
sufficient
reason
for
blocking
commerce
at
maine's
border.
in
two
of
those
particular
instances--
mr.
e.
paul
eggert
--well,
the
hughes
versus
oklahoma
indicates
that
the
strict
scrutiny
standard
is
what
is
being
applied
and
what
has
to
be
applied.
that
language
is
identical
to
that
used
in
equal
protection
cases.
i
know
of
no
other
place
in
which
that
standard
is
fully
explicated.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that,
yes,
indeed,
it
is
the
same
standard
and
that
the
courts
have
to
go
beyond
just
what
is
presented
to
it
by
way
of
factual
basis.
this
particular
case
is
justification
for
the
statute
and
gives
serious
consideration
and
hard
consideration
as
to
whether
or
not
that
is
sufficient
to
allow
a
state
to
block
interstate
commerce.
in
this
particular
case
factually,
we
have
one
of
the
parasites,
capillaria,
being
proposed
and
that
was
found
in
this
particular
shipment,
as
i
understand
it.
that
is
proposed
as
a
justification
for
blocking
interstate
commerce,
and
yet
the
state's
expert
has
agreed
he
has
found
capillaria
within
the
state.
mr.
e.
paul
eggert
no,
i
don't
think
it
can
speculate
and
go
totally
outside
the
record,
but
it
certainly
can
look
to
other
sources
in
the
sense
that
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals
did.
it
went
to
maine's
statutory
and
regulatory
structure
to
see
whether
or
not
maine's
avowed
purpose
with
this
statute
was
at
all
consistent
with
what
they
do
with
other
fish.
the
state's
contention
is
that
somehow
baitfish
are
entirely
different
from
trout
and
salmon
which
they
would
like
to
encourage
in
the
state
of
maine
and
that
is
true
because
they
are
different
species.
however,
there
is
a
bit
of
prejudice,
i
believe,
involved
in
that
particular
conception
and
that
is
that
somehow
the
baitfish
dealers
in
arkansas
are
not
as
careful
and
good
as
the
trout
raisers
in
maryland,
let's
say,
without
much
justification
for
that.
the
state's
experts--
mr.
e.
paul
eggert
--no,
i
don't
believe
they
do.
mr.
e.
paul
eggert
because
it
is
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact.
mr.
e.
paul
eggert
i
agree.
mr.
e.
paul
eggert
they
are
bound
by
the
clearly
erroneous
test
when
they
look
at
the
facts,
but
they
are
not
bound
when
they
then
apply
the
legal
standard
to
that.
mr.
e.
paul
eggert
okay.
but,
then,
when
they
go
and
look
at
the
legal
standard
that
the
district
court
applied
and
determines,
which
i
believe
they
did
determine,
that
the
district
court
was
wrong
with
that
legal
standard,
then
i
think
that
opens
to
question
whether
or
not
the
district
court
was
adequately
and
properly
looking
at
the
factual
record
in
making
its
findings.
mr.
e.
paul
eggert
i
guess
it
is
more
of
a
hybrid.
i
think
the
courts
have
said
that
when
there
are
factual
findings
that
don't
fit
into
the
legal
structure
or
the
proper
legal
standard,
that
the
courts
then
are
not
bound
by
those
factual
findings.
that
they
then
have
to
somehow
get
back
into
the
record
and
review
the
facts.
so,
if
as
far
as
we
had
to
go
was
to
say
could
the
district
court,
based
on
the
record,
determine
that
there
were
no
alternative
means
or
that
there
were
no
other
alternative
means
of
testing
or
that
there
are
no
adequate
methods
of
testing
and
that
was
the
end
of
the
question,
then
i
think,
yes,
the
district
court
would
be
correct.
the
court
of
appeals
would
apply
the
clearly
erroneous
standard.
but,
that
does
not
end,
in
my
view,
the
inquiry
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
to
undertake
when
it
reviews
the
district
court
findings.
i
would
like
to
perhaps
clear
up
a
problem
in
the
record
and
that
is
i
do
not
believe
any
of
the
experts
said
there
were
no
procedures
except
procedures
for
testing
various
fish
for
these
parasite
problems.
the
state's
expert
himself
testified
that
he
tested
the
fish
in
his
samples
for
the
three
parasite
problems
and
was
satisfied
that
he
found
two
of
the
three
within
the
shipment.
i
think
that
is
pretty
clear
evidence
that,
in
fact,
there
is
a
testing
procedure.
what
is
really
at
issue
and
what
the
experts
disagree
upon
is
the
sampling
procedure
which
is
undertaken.
now,
with
trout
and
salmon,
everybody
has
agreed
that
some
"x"
number
of
a
thousand
fish,
five
out
of
a
thousand
fish
can
be
sampled
and
if
those
are
disease
free,
then
we
can
pretty
safely
say
that
the
entire
shipment
is
disease
free.
experts
have
not
yet
agreed
we
can
do
that
and
say
we
have
sampled
five
of
the
thousand
baitfish
and,
therefore,
the
entire
shipment
is
disease
free
and
the
reason
that
hasn't
been
done
is
because
these
particular
problems
that
the
state
is
talking
about
do
not
pose
a
threat
to
the
total
ecological
system
of
the
warm-water
fish
in
maine.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
that
kind
of
problem
is
posed
by
importing
baitfish.
mr.
e.
paul
eggert
that
is
correct.
mr.
e.
paul
eggert
the
state's
position
is
that
that
is
going
to
pose
a
problem.
mr.
e.
paul
eggert
i
don't
know.
mr.
e.
paul
eggert
our
position
is
that
it
does
not
pose
a
problem
in
the
sense
that
it
will
not
infect
the
wild
fish
population;
that
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record,
even
though
these
parasites
have
existed
in
other
states
all
over
the
country,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
from
the
state
that
shows
that
these
have
ever...
that
these
problems
have
ever
been
transmitted
to
wild
fish
and
there
certainly
should
be
if
the
state
is
correct.
mr.
e.
paul
eggert
yes.
mr.
e.
paul
eggert
yes.
the
state's
expert
testified
that
these
problems
do
exist
in
fish,
in
baitfish,
golden
shiners;
that
they
have
been
found
in
illegally
imported
baitfish,
but
that
is
as
far
as
they
go.
they
say
that
one
of
the
parasites
does
cause
mortality
in
individual
fish,
but
a
scarcity
in
the
record
of
whether
or
not
that
translates
into
any
harm
for
the
environment.
what
is
not
in
the
record
perhaps
is
that
this
is
a
changing
field.
the
experts
are
disagreeing
and
they
perhaps
are
going
to
be
developing,
and
as
i
understand
it,
have
developed
tests
for--
mr.
e.
paul
eggert
--when
it
comes
to--
mr.
e.
paul
eggert
--no.
mr.
e.
paul
eggert
no,
they
do,
and
they
exist
in
probably
all
the
other...
in
many
of
the
other
states
and
have
not
caught
the
problem.
mr.
e.
paul
eggert
i
am
not
sure
i
would
concede
that,
no.
it
is
something
that--
mr.
e.
paul
eggert
--no.
mr.
e.
paul
eggert
no.
i
would
submit
that,
yes,
that
they
are
not
a
sufficient
problem.
mr.
e.
paul
eggert
yes.
mr.
e.
paul
eggert
no.
mr.
e.
paul
eggert
the
other--
mr.
e.
paul
eggert
--that
is
what
i
am
saying.
mr.
e.
paul
eggert
the
other
reason
that
the
state's
attempt
to...
or
the
state's
scheme
to
protect
its
ecology,
if
i
may
phrase
it
that
way,
cannot
be
effective
is
that
maine's
water
environment
is
not
unique.
in
fact,
it
shares
a
substantial
watershed
with
the
state
of
new
hampshire
which
the
state's
own
expert
conceded.
his
testimony
was
sufficient
that
the
state
could
not
possibly
block
these
problems
from
coming
to
the
state
of
maine
as
long
as
the
state
of
new
hampshire
allowed
importation
of
baitfish
into
that
particular
state.
and,
he
further
conceded
that
as
far
as
he
knew,
and
it
is
as
far
as
i
know
true,
the
state
of
new
hampshire
does
allow
importation
of
these
golden
shiners.
in
fact,
they
come
probably
from
the
same
place,
through
the
massachusetts
wholesale
dealers,
into
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
and,
any
release
of
those
baitfish
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire,
at
least
in
the
common,
shared
watershed
between
new
hampshire
and
maine
is
going
to
mean
that
these
problems
are
going
to
exist
in
maine,
if,
in
fact,
they
don't
already
exist,
and
they
probably
do,
and
the
state--
mr.
e.
paul
eggert
--well,
your
honor,
they
certainly
don't
take
any
steps
with
their
regulatory
and
statutory
scheme
to
try
to
deal
with
that
problem
as
exists
within
the
state.
mr.
howard
mentioned
the
possibility
of
carp
coming
into
the
state.
well,
carp
does
exist
in
the
state
of
maine
and
it
exists
in
the
lower
kennebec
river.
and,
i
don't
know
of
anything
that
would
prevent
people
from
taking
that
carp
and
spreading
it
to
the
rest
of
the
state.
if
the
state
is
really
serious
about
dealing
with
what
they
perceive
to
be
problems,
it
would
seem
to
me
it
would
be
within
a
framework,
consistent
framework,
that
would
deal
with
all
these
problems,
both
in
state
and
out
of
state
and
they
just
don't
do
that.
they
take
it
one
little
perceived
problem
and
have
dealt
with
it
in
a
most
severe
fashion
and
that
is
to
stop
all
commerce
in
that
particular
area.
finally,
and
perhaps
by
no
means
least,
the
district
court
found
that
there
was
no
economic
protectionism
involved
in
this
particular
statute
despite
some
direct
evidence
in
a
publication
by
the
department
of
inland
fisheries
that
it
was
better
to
raised
baitfish
in
maine
and
keep
maine's
baitfish
economic
alive
and
healthy
rather
than
spending
our
money
in
arkansas.
the
circuit
court
of
appeals,
i
think,
more
correctly
looked
at
that
and
at
least
indicated
that
that
was
a
reflection,
that
there
was,
indeed,
some
economic
protectionism
involved
in
this
particular
case
and
that
is
the
very
problem
that
the
commerce
clause
is
designed
to
prevent.
mr.
e.
paul
eggert
yes,
indeed,
they
could.
mr.
e.
paul
eggert
yes.
mr.
e.
paul
eggert
i
would
think
the
state
could
regulate
in
such
a
fashion
that
they
say
people
in
maine,
we
will
not
allow
fishing
with
live
bait
in
the
state
of
maine.
if
that
is
a
serious
problem,
if
the
state
thinks
there
are
serious
problems
with
live
bait,
then
that
is
an
even-handed
regulation
that
they
certainly
could
adopt.
politically
i
am
not
sure
the
could,
but--
mr.
e.
paul
eggert
--no.
i
am
suggesting
that
the
state
is
required
to
perhaps
expend
a
little
bit
of
effort
to
regulate
and
allow
baitfish
to
be
imported
into
the
state
of
maine
under
strict
controls
perhaps,
but
not
be
allowed
to
just
flatly
prohibit
the
importation
of
baitfish.
i
believe
that
the
state
of
maine
can,
if
it
wants
to,
devise
a
system,
a
permanent
system,
a
licensed
system,
an
inspection
system
which
would
satisfy
them
and
which
would
satisfy
mr.
taylor
and
other
bait
dealers
in
the
state
of
maine,
indeed,
as
many
other
states
in
the
northeast.
mr.
e.
paul
eggert
if
that
is
what
it
takes
for
him
to
be
able
to
import
baitfish,
to
have
them
inspected
somewhere
else,
he
certainly
would.
the
place
where
most
of
these
baitfish
come
from
in
arkansas,
there
is,
in
fact...
i
am
not
sure,
the
department
of
inland
fisheries
research
station
there
that
does,
in
fact,
test
sample
certified
fish
to
be
disease
free
and
they
certainly
could
do
that
right
there
at
the
source
in
arkansas
and
the
fish
could
be
brought
into
maine
quickly.
thank
you.
