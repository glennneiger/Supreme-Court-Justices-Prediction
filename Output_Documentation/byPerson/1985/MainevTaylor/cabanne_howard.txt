mr.
cabanne
howard
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
state
of
maine,
consistent
with
the
commerce
clause,
may
prohibit
the
importation
of
live
baitfish
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
its
environment.
the
case
is
here
on
the
state's
appeal
from
a
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
which
declared
the
state
statute
unconstitutional
for
failing
to
survive
the
strict
scrutiny
test
required
by
this
court
in
hughes
versus
oklahoma.
this
court
subsequently
postponed
jurisdiction
over
the
appeal
until
this
hearing.
after
a
brief
summary
of
the
relevant
facts
and
a
statement
of
why
this
court
has
jurisdiction,
i
would
like
to
explain
why
the
court
of
appeals
misapplied
the
proper
standard
for
appellate
review
of
factual
findings
in
district
court
set
forth
in
rule
52(a)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
and
why
the
court
also
subjected
the
maine
statute
to
an
unnecessarily
strict
standard
of
constitutional
scrutiny.
the
state
of
maine
has
a
small
and
unique
freshwater
fishery.
it
is
available
to
all
residents
and
non-residents
alike.
to
protect
that
fishery,
in
1959
the
state's
legislature
passed
a
statute
which
is
at
issue
in
this
case
to
protect
the
fishery
against
the
importation
of
diseased
fish.
in
1981,
congress
passed
the
lacey
act
amendment
of
that
year,
making
it
a
federal
crime
to
engage
in
interstate
commerce
in
violation
of
statutes
such
as
maine's.
in
february
of
1983,
the
defendant
in
this
case
was
indicted
for
importing
and
158,000
baitfish,
some
of
which
contained
various
diseases
about
which
the
state
was
concerned.
the
defendant
moved
to
dismiss
the
indictment
on
the
grounds
of
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
underlying
state
statute.
the
state
was
permitted
to
intervene
pursuant
to
title
28
united
states
code,
section
2403(b)
in
order
to
defend
its
statute.
an
evidentiary
hearing
was
held
before
a
united
states
magistrate
and
the
state
and
federal
government
introduced
substantial
expert
testimony
showing
that
its
statute
satisfied
both
prongs
of
the
hughes
versus
oklahoma
test,
those
being
that
the
statute
was
needed
to
protect
the
state
against
various
parasites
and
exotic
species
which
could
come
in
through
a
shipment
of
live
bait,
and,
secondly,
that
there
was
no
alternative
to
an
absolute
ban
on
the
importation.
the
district
court
and...
the
magistrate
and
subsequently
the
district
court
agreed
with
the
state
and
sustained
the
statute,
but
the
court
of
appeals,
asserting
its
freedom
to
re-evaluate
the
evidence
completely,
reversed.
the
state
then
appealed
to
this
court,
although
the
united
states
government
did
not.
the
state
believes
that
this
case
is
covered
by
the
plain
language
28
united
state
code,
section
1254(2)
which
gives
this
court
jurisdiction,
and
i
am
quoting,
"by
appeal
by
a
party
relying
on
a
state
statute
held
by
a
court
of
appeals
to
be
invalid.
"
on
the
merits,
on
the
question
of
the
adequacy
of
the
evidence
to
support
the
district
court's
finding,
the
state
believes
that
with
regard
to
the...
that
the
principle
error
created
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
was
a
decision
in
effect
to
retry
the
case.
the
state's
evidence
here
was
overwhelming
that
the
statute
met
both
prongs
of
the
hughes
test.
with
regard
to
the
legitimate
purpose
behind
the
statute,
the
state
fish
pathologist
and
two
other
expert...
academic
experts
testified
that
the
statute
was
needed
to
guard
against
both
three
specific
parasites
which
could
establish
themselves
in
maine's
sport
fish
such
as
trout,
bass,
and
salmon,
and
also
that
the
statute
was
needed
to
protect
against
the
introduction
of
exotic
species
such
as,
for
example,
the
common
carp,
which
might
successfully
compete
with
indigenous
species
for
habitat.
the
same
witnesses,
as
well
as
the
defendant's
own
expert,
testified
as
to
the
second
prong
of
the
hughes
test;
that
the
scientific
community
has
not
established
a
testing
program
of
any
kind
for
baitfish.
and,
since
that
is
the
case,
since
there
is
no
possibility
of
inspecting
fish
or
testing
fish--
mr.
cabanne
howard
--yes.
mr.
cabanne
howard
what
i
am
reciting
is
what
the
district
court
found
to
be
the
facts
in
the
case.
mr.
cabanne
howard
well,
that
is
contained
in
the
district
court's
findings
if
you
read
them,
the
findings
of...
it
refers
specifically
to
what
the
witnesses
testified
and
then
find
as
a
fact
certain
things,
these
things.
mr.
cabanne
howard
well,
we
believe
that
this
court
should
act
in
the
same
way
as
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
acted,
which
is
to
apply
the
clear
erroneous
test
to
the
record
and
if
you
find
that
there
is
substantial
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
the
findings
of
the
district
court,
you
should
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
and--
mr.
cabanne
howard
--in
the
jurisdictional
statement?
mr.
cabanne
howard
oh,
no.
but,
if
you
read...
it
is
not
a
very
long
opinion.
it
covers
nine
pages.
mr.
cabanne
howard
it
is
replete
with
references
to
the
transcript.
i
don't
think
you
will
find
any
difficulty
in
finding
where
the
findings
are.
mr.
cabanne
howard
yes.
yes,
he
does.
with
regard,
for
example,
to
the
question
of
alternatives,
he
finds
as
a
fact...
the
quote
is
"the
fact
remains",
i
am
quoting
now.
it
is
on
page
d-9.
"the
fact
remains
that
testing
procedures
have
not
been
devised.
"
mr.
cabanne
howard
there
were...
if
i
can
summarize--
mr.
cabanne
howard
--yes,
that
is
right.
the
thrust
of
the
defendant's
expert
testimony
which
the
defendant's
counsel
will
summarize
also
was
that
the
diseases
and
parasites
that
the
state
was
concerned
about
were
really
not
that
serious,
therefore,
there
was
no
need
for--
mr.
cabanne
howard
--yes,
sir,
they
certainly
did,
and
we
would
suggest
that
is
a
very
important
part
of
this
case.
mr.
cabanne
howard
the
experts
were
in
disagreement
on
the
question
of
the
seriousness
of
a
threat.
mr.
cabanne
howard
he
says
that
it
is
not...
the
commerce
clause
should
not
be
read
to
require
the
state
to
take
the
risk
that
something
will
happen
to
the
state.
mr.
cabanne
howard
well,
that
is
true.
either
way
it
is
satisfactory
for
us.
mr.
cabanne
howard
well--
mr.
cabanne
howard
--we
think
that
we
have
satisfied
the
hughes
test
even
giving
it
the
strictest
reading
that
the
first
circuit's
opinion
could
be
read
to
give
it.
so,
we
are
not
relying
on
any--
mr.
cabanne
howard
--well,
i
think
that
makes
sense.
mr.
cabanne
howard
well,
i
think
hughes
could
be
read
to
include
such
a
statement,
where
there
is
such
a
test,
where
there
is
doubt
in
the
scientific
community.
as
i
am
going
to
say
in
a
minute,
of
course,
we...
think...
a
further
argument
in
this
case
can
be
made
that
the
standard
should
be
not
as
strict
as
the
hughes
test
in
the
first
place.
but,
that
argument
aside,
i
think--
mr.
cabanne
howard
--i
didn't
get
the
impression
from
reading
the
district
court's
opinion
that
the
district
court...
rather
reading
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
that
it
was
disagreeing
with
what
the
district
court
had
said.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
that
the
district
court
was
applying
the
strict
scrutiny
test
and
in
applying
the
test
it
is
fair
enough
to
say
that
if
there
is
doubt
among
the
scientific
community
as
to
what
the
status
of
science
is,
that
that
ought
to
be
enough
to
give
the
state
a
legitimate
purpose
in
legislating
against
uncertainties.
so,
i
don't
see
a
difference
between
the
two
at
all.
as
i
was
saying
a
second
ago,
the
prohibition...
the
needs
of
this
prohibition
in
this
case
is
required
because
of
the
absolute
testing
procedure.
the
evidence
that
the
district
court
found
was
that
there
is
no
testing
procedure.
so,
in
short,
the
state
feels
that
it
satisfied
the
hughes
test
in
this
case
no
matter
how
strictly
one
wants
to
state
it.
and,
in
fact,
the
hughes
test
can't
be
satisfied
on
the
evidence
in
this
record.
it
probably
is
a
test
that
nobody
can
satisfy.
now,
beyond
this,
the
state
also
suggests
that
the
strict
scrutiny
test
of
hughes
may
not
be
appropriate
to
apply
in
this
case
for
the
reason
that
the
congress
enacted
the
lacey
act
amendments
in
1981
which
encouraged
the
states
to
pass
statutes
of
this
kind.
and,
if
the
courts
were
to
continue
to
apply
the
strict
scrutiny
test
to
statutes
like
this,
that
would
frustrate
the
will
of
congress
in
passing
the
lacey
act
amendments.
in
short,
there
is
a
need
to
harmonize
the
policy
of
congress
in
encouraging
statutes
like
this
with,
of
course,
the
policy
of
the
commerce
clause
to
prevent
the
economic
vulcanization
of
the
united
states.
in
our
brief,
we
have
suggested
that
there
is
a
way
in
which
the
court
could
fashion
a
lower
degree
of
scrutiny.
we
are
not
arguing
that
there
should
be
no
scrutiny
at
all,
of
course,
but
we
do
argue
that
there
should
be
a
lesser
degree
of
scrutiny.
for
example,
on
the
question
of
legitimate
purpose,
we
think
that
the
proper
way
under
the
lacey
act
to
approach
a
case
like
this
would
be
to
presume
that
the
state
statute,
that
the
state
legislature
has
acted
for
the
legitimate
purpose
that
it
says
and
put
the
burden
on
the
defendant
to
come
in
with
some
evidence
that
there
is
some
illegitimate
purpose
going
on.
and,
similarly,
on
the
question
of
whether
there
is
an
adequate
alternative,
the
state
should
be
given
a
little
bit
more
leeway
than
being
required
to
adopt
any
hypothetical
alternative
that
the
court
of
appeals
might
be
able
to
think
up.
in
conclusion,
the
state
believes
that
the
commerce
clause
should
not
require
it
to
take
the
risk
that
the
indiscriminate
importation
of
baitfish
would
not
be
harmful
to
its
environment.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
cabanne
howard
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
just
three
points
in
response
to
the
prior
questions.
justice
white,
with
regard
to
the
question
you
were
just
asking,
the
problem
of
sending
inspectors
to
other
states
is
the
same
problem
that
applies
to
inspecting
in
maine.
there
is
no
test
that
anybody
can
apply
anywhere.
mr.
cabanne
howard
that
is
the
point.
the
point
is
there
is
no
test
that
can
be
done
to
find
the
parasites
and
the
diseases.
there
is
such
a
test
for
semolinas.
the
scientific
community
has
not
developed
one.
that
is
uncontradicted
on
this
record
which
leads
me
to
respond
to
an
earlier
question
from
justice
o'connor.
you
were
concerned,
as
i
recall,
about
whether
there
is
a
difference
in
the
test
that
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
applied
here.
i
had
a
chance
to
reread
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
during
the
other
arguments
and
i
can't
see
anything
in
there
that
indicates
that
the
court
of
appeals
criticized
the
district
court
on
its
application
of
the
test.
and,
furthermore,
the
point
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
reversed;
that
is
that
there
was
other
means
that
the
state
hadn't
sought
and
found
to
protect
itself,
that
point
is
one
in
which
there
is
no
disagreement
in
the
record.
there
is
no
evidence
at
all
that
there
is
no
test.
the
record
is
unequivocal.
the
disagreement
occurs
on
the
point
as
to
whether
there
is
a
risk,
whether
there
is
a
real
risk
or
not.
the
defendant's
experts
on
that
issue
tried
to
make
the
point
that
there
was
a
difficulty
on
the
risk.
but,
that
wasn't
the
point
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
lower
court.
so,
it
doesn't
seem
that
there
is
a
problem
with
regard
to
the
application
of
the
test
in
either
case.
and,
as
to
the
question
about
the
risk,
justice
stevens,
i
think
you
were
concerned
that
the
district
court
didn't
make
findings
about
that
and
if
i
could
just
direct
your
attention
to
a
paragraph
on
page
d-7
of
the
jurisdictional
statement.
it
is
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
the
first
full
paragraph.
i
think
that
is
the
paragraph
where
the
court
is
finding
that...
having
cited
the
testimony
above
it...
the
court
is
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
given
the
somewhat
unique
characteristics
associated
with
the
maine
fish
population,
the
substantial
uncertainties
surrounding
the
effects
and
so
on
shows
that
there
is
a
risk.
mr.
cabanne
howard
well,
i
realize
the
court
didn't
use
the
words
"i
hereby
find"--
mr.
cabanne
howard
--yes.
well,
i
think
that
is
his
conclusion.
mr.
cabanne
howard
well,
because--
mr.
cabanne
howard
--that
is
right.
it
is
a
summary
of
the
preceding
testimony
and
then
in
the
next
paragraph
he
goes
on
to
the
next
standard.
mr.
cabanne
howard
excuse
me?
mr.
cabanne
howard
right.
but,
i
think
he
is
finding
that
there
is
a
substantial
uncertainty.
that
is
to
say
that
he
is
not
finding
that...
he
is
finding
that
there
is
a
legitimate
uncertainty
here.
presumably
there
could
be
a
situation
where
a
state
could
come
in--
mr.
cabanne
howard
--yes.
mr.
cabanne
howard
anyway,
i
think
that
finding
is
there,
at
least
i
would
characterize--
mr.
cabanne
howard
--yes,
that
is
right,
and
that
is
what
we
need.
all
we
need
to
show
is
there
is
a
finding
as
to
uncertainty
and
there
is
substantial
evidence
to
support
that
finding.
and,
if
that
is
the
case,
we
think
we
should
win
the
case.
mr.
cabanne
howard
no.
and,
i
think
one
of
the
reasons
why
there
isn't
is
because
the
state
of
maine...
and
it
is
in
the
record
and
the
courts
found
this
below...
a
unique
and
fragile
fishery
here
which
requires
a
prohibition
of
this
kind.
many
other
states
have
regimes
where
the
state
administrative
officer,
the
fish
&
game
commissioner,
let's
say,
has
the
power
to
regulate
the
importation
of
fish
and
presumably
under
those--
mr.
cabanne
howard
--well,
they
would
be
equally
dangerous
to
new
hampshire.
mr.
cabanne
howard
i
think
they
do.
at
least--
mr.
cabanne
howard
--i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
as
to
what
the
new
hampshire
law
is.
mr.
cabanne
howard
i
don't
know,
but
the
situation--
mr.
cabanne
howard
--i
know
of
no
other
state
that
has
a
statutory
prohibition.
mr.
cabanne
howard
it
is
a
question
of
what
the
state
administrative
officers
do
with
their
administration
discretion
that
legislatures
may
have
given
to
them.
mr.
cabanne
howard
no,
i
do
not
know,
but
that
doesn't
mean
it
isn't
being
done.
in
short,
it
is
the
fragility
of
the
maine
ecology
that
requires
a
prohibition
of
this
kind.
mr.
cabanne
howard
yes.
we
have
a
very
unique
fresh-water,
pure-water
fishery
with
a
lot
of...
a
small
number
of
fish,
trout,
bass,
salmon
that
are
very
vital
to
our
state
and
because
of
that
unique
fact
the
state
has
a
special
interest
in
keeping
that
pure.
thank
you.
