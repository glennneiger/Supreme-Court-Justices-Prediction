e.
burger
mr.
howard,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
i
understand
your
brief,
you
take
the
position
that
the
court
of
appeals
acted
as
a
trial
de
novo
in
effect
and
you
are
giving
your
version
of
the
evidence.
you
are
not
giving
us
the
findings
that
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
ignored.
do
we
have
to
look
at
the
original
underlying
evidence
ourselves
or
can
we
content
ourselves
to
look
at
the
district
court's
findings?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
it
is
important
to
know
whether
there
is
some
framework
here
for
a
disagreement
on
the
legal
standard
between
the
district
court
and
the
first
circuit.
chief
justice

mr.
ganzfried?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
gansfried,
do
you
think
there
is
any
tension
or
disagreement
between
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
hughes
standard?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
eggert?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
isn't
the
court
of
appeals
bound
by
the
clearly
erroneous
test
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don't
suggest
that
these
parasites
don't
exist?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
you
are
just
submitting
the
state
isn't...
they
may
have
a
little
problem
and
they
aren't
entitled
to
try
to
keep
it
little.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
