mr.
donald
j.
zoeller
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
appeal
involves
the
circumstances
under
which
courts
may
permit
factfinders
to
infer
from
a
mix
of
evidence
that
there
has
been
a
conspiracy
in
violation
of
the
united
states
antitrust
laws.
in
this
case,
the
district
court,
after
carefully
reviewing
and
analyzing
the
mountain
of
evidence
that
had
been
gathered
by
the
plaintiffs
during
the
pretrial
phase,
determined
that
that
evidence
could
not
support
a
rational
inference
that
the
defendants
had
entered
into
and
carried
out
the
alleged
conspiracy
to
establish
low
and
predatory
prices
in
the
united
states
market.
the
court
accordingly
granted
summary
judgment.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
said
a
trial
was
necessary.
in
reversing,
the
court
of
appeals
made
two
fundamental
errors.
first,
it
failed
to
follow
and
carry
out
this
court's
inference
standards
as
enunciated
in
the
case
of
first
national
city
bank
of
arizona
v.
cities
service.
as
a
result
of
that
error,
the
court
was
led
to
authorize
a
factfinder
to
speculate
that
pricing
conduct
in
the
united
states
market,
indistinguishable
from
the
kind
of
vigorous
pricing
competition
fostered
by
the
antitrust
laws
and
beneficial
to
consumers,
that
is
low
prices
for
the
purpose
of
getting
business,
was
actually
not
competition
as
it
appeared
to
be
but
was
conspiracy.
in
reversing
and
finding
summary
judgment
inappropriate,
the
court
of
appeals
also
held
and
made
basic
reliance
on
its
conclusion
that
a
factfinder
could
incur...
infer,
excuse
me,
that
conduct
by
the
defendants
which
their
government
ordered
them
and
said
it
ordered
them
to
enter
into
in
furtherance
of
a
japanese
governmental
program
was
part
of
a
conspiracy
that
violated
our
laws.
now,
these
two
errors
not
only
call
for
reversal
in
this
case
but
established
a
dangerous
precedent
that
this
court
should
deal
with.
first
of
all,
they
are
dangerous
from
the
standpoint
of
antitrust
policy.
permitting
an
inference
of
conspiracy
to
be
drawn
from
conduct
indistinguishable
from
competition
can
chill
the
vigorous
competition
that
the
antitrust
laws
seek
to
foster
in
the
interest
of
american
consumers.
secondly,
this
precedent
is
dangerous
from
the
standpoint
of
judicial
administration.
district...
carving
out
and
fashioning
exceptions
to
this
court's
inference
standards
in
order
to
turn
down
motions
for
summary
judgment
can
cause
district
courts
to
say
all
the
monumental
effort
that
it
takes
to
tame
and
control
a
case
of
the
size
of
this
case
is
simply
not
worth
it;
that
it
will
simply
be
frustrated
by
the
courts
above.
and
this
decision
is
dangerous
from
the
standpoint
of
the
relationship
of
the
united
states
to
its
most
valued
trading
partners.
i
would
like
to
deal
first
with
the
inference
of
conspiracy
question.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
a
factfinder
could
infer
from
the
record
in
this
case
that
the
pricing
activities
of
the
defendants
in
the
united
states
market
were
not
individual
competitive
activities,
but
were
coordinated
and
orchestrated
pursuant
to
some
common
plan
or
some
agreement.
for
such
an
inference
to
be
rational,
however,
the
record
should
show
there
should
be
evidence
of
uniform
prices
suggestive
of
conspiracy,
or
at
the
very
minimum
that
those
prices
showed
some
discernible
pattern
in
the
united
states
market.
there
is
no
such
evidence
in
this
case.
the
plaintiffs
don't
even
pretend
there
is
such
evidence
in
this
case.
the
most
that
the
evidence
in
this
case
shows,
such
pricing
evidence
as
there
is,
is
that
the
prices
by
the
japanese
defendants
in
this
market
were,
as
the
district
court
stated,
all
over
the
lot;
that
they
ran
at
every
price
level
in
the
united
states
market
from
the
highest
price
levels
on
down;
that
they
were
so
varied
that
the
plaintiffs
could
describe
the
allegedly
conspiratorial
conduct
only
in
terms
of
competition.
they
say
the
japanese
defendants
agreed
to
charge
prices
necessary
to
get
the
sale.
so
does
every
competitor.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
jury
or
a
factfinder
could
infer
that
these
pricing
activities
were
predatory
and
that
they
were
part
of
an
overall
scheme
under
which
supposedly
high
prices
and
profits
in
the
japanese
market
could
be
dumped
into
the
united
states
market
for
the
purpose
of
supporting
low
prices
here;
for
the
ultimate
purpose
of
jointly
monopolizing
the
united
states
market.
now,
for
such
an
inference
to
be
rational,
the
plaintiffs
should
be
able
to
produce
some
evidence
that
there
was
a
purpose
to
predation;
that
ultimately
those
who
paid
the
price
of
predation
could
recover
their
predatory
losses
through
monopoly
profits
at
some
foreseeable
point
where
it
made
some
sense.
they
should
also
have
some
evidence
that
those
smaller
japanese
competitors,
those
who
had
smaller
shares
of
the
united
states
market,
had
a
mechanism
to
share
the
burdens
and
benefit
of
predation
at
the
one
hand
and
monopolization
at
the
other.
far
from
showing
that,
the
record
in
this
case
is
entirely
to
the
contrary.
the
undisputed
facts
of
this
case
are
that
from
the
beginning
of
the
alleged
period
of
conspiracy
when
these
companies
entered
the
united
states
market
with
zero
market
shares,
on
through
the
roughly
20
years
covered
by
this
case,
the
two
market
leaders
in
the
united
states,
zenith
and
rca,
remained
the
two
market
leaders
in
the
united
states;
lost
none
of
their
market
shares.
and
there
is
no
evidence
of
any
high
barriers
to
entry
in
this
market.
it
was
a
highly
competitive
market;
therefore,
where
could
an
inference
be
drawn
that
predation
would
make
any
sense,
that
there
could
ever
be
a
recoupment.
the
plaintiffs
don't
address
themselves
to
it.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
address
itself
to
it.
there
is
no
evidence
whatever
of
a
sharing
mechanism
among
these
companies.
thus,
the
undisputed
facts
of
this
case
show
that
the
pricing
activities
of
the
defendants
in
the
united
states
are
entirely
indistinguishable
from
normal
pricing
activities
by
competitors,
and
that
there
is
no
basis
for
an
inference
of
predatory
purpose
behind
their
activities.
mr.
donald
j.
zoeller
yes,
your
honor,
it
is
entirely
irrelevant.
mr.
donald
j.
zoeller
that
evidence
has
to
do
with
sharing
figures
on
production
and
inventory
in
the
japanese,
as
to
the
japanese
market.
it
is
entirely
irrelevant--
mr.
donald
j.
zoeller
--your
honor,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
experts
that
the
defendants
rely
upon
say...
didn't
say
that
they
began
by
producing
much
more
than
they
consume.
they
said
that
as
time
went
on,
they
built
plants
to
produce
more,
which
doesn't
suggest
a
predatory
purpose,
your
honor,
but
it
suggests
that
there
is
competition
taking
place,
and
they
are
attempting
now
to
satisfy
increasing
shares
in
the
united
states
through
investment
in
new
plant
and
facilities;
not
that
they
had
it
on
their
hands
and
had
to
dump
itself.
mr.
donald
j.
zoeller
they
were
members
of
trade
associations,
your
honor,
and
they
exchange
a
lot
of
kinds
of
information
that
people
do
in
trade
associations.
there
is
some
evidence
that
there
was
allegedly
collusive
activities
in
the
japanese
market
designed
to
hold
up
the
prices
of
the
japanese
market,
but
there
is
no
evidence
that
would
show
any
rational,
logical
or
natural
connection
between
that
and
activities
in
the
united
states.
and
on
this
record
of
the
type
of
activities
that
were
engaged
in
in
the
united
states,
such
a
connection
would
not
make
sense.
what
really
happened
here
is
that
when
it
came
to
the
critical,
your
honor,
when
it
came
to
the
critical
question
of
what
was
happening
in
the
united
states
market,
whether
the
activities
in
the
united
states
market
showed
the
signs
of
conspiracy,
the
court
of
appeals
said
it
did
not
have
to
follow
this
court's
inference
standards
for
that
purpose.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
fact
that
it
saw
some
evidence
of
some
collusion
in
japan
and
that
it
saw
the
japanese
companies
engaging
in
their
government's
export
program,
which
would
have
had
a
natural
tendency
to
hold
up
prices
in
the
united
states,
not
drive
them
down,
but
since
it
saw
some
collusion
someplace,
it
said
all
it
had
to
do
then
as
far
as
the
critical
question
of
what
was
going
on
in
the
united
states
market
is
see
some
"circumstantial
evidence
having
some
tendency
to
suggest
that
other
kinds
of
conduct
of
concert
of
action
may
have
occurred.
"
and
that's
at
page
165a
of
the
record,
and
there
the
court,
in
deciding
the
critical
question
of
whether
the
activities
in
the
united
states
were
beneficial
to
american
consumers
or
were
injurious,
collusive
activities,
said
we
look
at
it
in
terms
of
possibilities,
not
what
flows
naturally
and
logically
from
the
record,
as
this
court
required
in
cities
service.
and
to
make
that
point
unmistakably
clear,
the
court
expressly
said
that
a
line
of
third
circuit
cases
based
on
cities
service
did
not
apply
and
that
the
court
did
not
have
to
follow
the
usual
rules
of
the
inference-drawing
process.
mr.
donald
j.
zoeller
your
honor,
under
some
circumstances
they
might
be,
but
on
the
record
of
this
case
there's
no
basis
to
suggest
that
they
were.
then,
in
other
words,
what
the
court
was
really
saying,
and
it's
the
point
i
addressed
earlier,
that
the
pricing
activities
in
the
japanese
market
were
designed
to
create
profits
that
could
be
then
poured
into
the
united
states
market
to
assume
losses.
that
is
a
design
of
predatory
intent,
but
on
this
record
with
20
years
having
gone
by
and
no
opportunity
to
recoup
and
no
possibility
of
a
rational
inference
that
recoupment
could
take
place
in
the
near
future,
such
an
inference
would
not
be
appropriate.
so,
the
relationship
was
not
shown
in
this
case.
those
activities
did
not
constitute
circumstantial
evidence
of
a
u.s.
pricing
conspiracy
in
this
case.
the
proof
of
the
putting,
if
the
court
had
looked
at
it
from
the
standpoint
of
the
united
states
market,
the
proof
of
the
putting
is
that
by
the
plaintiffs'
own
theory,
for
20
unbroken
years
all
of
the
pricing
activities
of
the
japanese
defendants
in
the
american
market
were
beneficial
to
american
consumers,
because
it
is
the
plaintiffs'
contention
that
those
prices
were
always
low;
that
they
brought
down
pricing
competition
in
the
united
states
market.
but
at
the
end
of
the
period
the
two
american
market
leaders
are
still
the
american
market
leaders
with
no
loss
of
market
share
and
no
basis
for
a
rational
suggestion
that
that
condition
would
change
at
any
time
in
the
foreseeable
future.
on
the
basis
of
that,
to
suggest
predatory
conspiracy
when
you
see
none
of
its
footprints
in
the
united
states
market
we
say
is
a
wrong
reading
of
the
law
of
inference
and
a
dangerous
standpoint,
because
now
the
united
states
antitrust
laws
are
used
by
those
who
wish
to
protect
themselves
from
competition
as
a
way
of
blocking
competition.
mr.
donald
j.
zoeller
well,
i
would
say,
your
honor,
it
is
not
peculiar.
it
applies
basic
the
principles
of
inference
drawing,
but
it
does
have
cognizance,
i
believe,
of
another
principle
as
well
and
that
is,
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
it's
wrong
and
inappropriate
to
draw
an
inference
of...
to
draw
an
inference
unless
that
inference
flows
naturally
and
logically
from
the
facts
before
you,
it
is
also
dangerous,
and
i
think
the
cities
service
case
recognized
it,
from
the
standpoint
of
antitrust
policy
to
take
conduct
that
could
either
be
competition
or
could
possibly
be
conspiracy
and
treat
it
as
conspiracy
because,
as
this
court
warned
in
monsanto,
there
is
a
danger
of
intruding
on
normal
competitive
activity.
so,
i
think
both
policies
coalesce
in
that
case.
mr.
donald
j.
zoeller
that
might
be
possibly
so,
but
to
the
extent
that
cities
service
also
says
that
the
inference
of
conspiracy
must
be
natural
and
logical,
it
applies.
but
the
same
broader
policy
that
the
record
must
be
rationally
explainable
in
terms
of
conspiracy
than
in
terms
of
inference,
which
is
the
cities
service
standard
as
we
read
it,
would
not
necessarily
have
to
apply
in
a
fraud
case.
the
court
of
appeals
committed
a
second
fundamental
error
when
it
failed
to
apply
the
sovereign
compulsion
and
active
state
defenses
to
the
conduct
of
the
japanese
defendants
in
following
their
government's
export
program.
the
japanese
government
has
said
in
a
clear,
detailed,
explicit
and
unequivocal
statement
and
in
a
note
verbal
that
it
compelled
the
conduct
in
question.
that
should
be
recognized
for
reasons,
among
others,
that
the
defense
is
supported
in
this
case
by
the
american
government,
by
the
executive
branch
of
this
government.
it
is
appropriate
because
the
conduct,
the
program
by
the
japanese
government
is
a
fundamental
government
program,
the
control
and
regulation
of
its
own
exports;
because
it
was
not
designed
by
the
japanese
government
to
be
harmful
to
the
united
states
but
to
avoid
trade
frictions
with
this
country.
mr.
donald
j.
zoeller
in
theory
it
is,
your
honor,
but
the
facts
of
the
case
show
that
there
would
be
no
basis
to
find
a
predatory
intent
as
we
see
it,
absent
the
evidence
of
conspiracy.
but
as
a
matter
of
theory,
there
are
individual
claims--
mr.
donald
j.
zoeller
--yes,
it
would,
your
honor.
if
there
were
anything
to
try--
mr.
donald
j.
zoeller
--i
think
it
should,
your
honor,
because
the
failure
of
the
conspiracy
evidence
would
destroy
any
evidence
of
predatory
intent
under
the
record
of
this
case.
mr.
donald
j.
zoeller
it
does
not
directly,
judge
rehnquist.
what
it
does
is
it
indicates
how
the
conspiracy
claim
must
fail,
and
i
think
we
have
shown
in
our
arguments
that
that
should
cause
the
dumping
claims
to
fail
as
well.
mr.
donald
j.
zoeller
yes,
and
we
don't
see
any
other
evidence
in
this
record
of
predatory
intent,
your
honor,
so
that
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
relied
upon
the
conspiracy
in
showing
any
predatory
intent
joint
or
individual,
and
that
is
why
they
dismissed
the
dumping
claims
jointly
and
individually
as
to
the
defendant
sony,
for
example.
if
i
may,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
donald
j.
zoeller
just
a
minute
or
two,
your
honor.
if
i
was
able,
successfully,
to
pick
my
way
through
the
last
part
of
mr.
rome's
argument,
i
think
he
and
i
did
agree
on
one
thing,
and
that
is
that
the
third
circuit
did
not
follow
the
teachings
of
the
cities
service
case,
and
they
had
good
reason
not
to.
the
record
would
not
support
a
rational,
logical
inference
that
a
conspiracy
to
establish
predatory
low
prices
in
the
united
states
ever
existed.
indeed,
this
is
an
unusual
case
where
the
record
directly
rebuts
it.
that
is
perhaps
the
reason,
also,
why
mr.
rome,
now
having
spent
an
additional
half
hour,
has
never
touched
on
the
question
of
what
the
record
of
the
activities
of
these
companies
in
the
united
states
market
was;
hasn't
discussed
their
pricing
activities;
disavows
any
intention
to
show
that
there
was
recoupment;
shows
no
way
that
those
activities
could
be
distinguished
from
the
competition
beneficial
to
consumers
which
the
antitrust
laws
are
seeking
to
foster,
not
to
squelch.
mr.
donald
j.
zoeller
i
am...
as
far
as
an
inference
is
concerned,
yes,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
i
am
saying
that
this
is
an
inference
case,
and
in
order
to
draw
an
inference
that
there
was
a
predatory
conspiracy,
in
order
to
distinguish
the
activities
of
these
companies,
the
pricing
activities
from
competition,
predation
would
be
an
essential
part
of
what
they're
saying.
mr.
donald
j.
zoeller
not
on
this
record,
your
honor,
and
i'll
take
that
on
two
fronts.
one,
it
would
be
illogical
to
assume
that
a
group
of
companies
would
engage
together
to
sell
below
costs
for
20
years
with
no
hope
of
ever
getting
that
back
out
of
those
activities,
and
this
record
will
not
support
such
a
hope.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
record
in
this
case
shows
only
very
brief,
very
sporadic
losses
by
four
of
the
petitioners,
and
as
to
even
one
of
those
four,
no
sales
losses
on
the
critical
area
of
color
television
receivers.
as
another
one
of
those
petitioners,
only
one
instance
of
a
sale
of
cost
in
the
critical
area
of
television,
of
color
television
receivers.
so,
there
really
isn't
evidence
of
sales
below
costs
on
any
pervasive
record
in
this
case,
and
it
would
be
illogical
to
assume
that
there
would
be
one
because
it
would
simply
be
an
act
of
insanity
to
go
for
20
years
predating
and
then
hope
ever
to
get
it
back.
even
forget
the
future,
just
take
20
years--
mr.
donald
j.
zoeller
--oh,
i
don't
know
how
many
companies
have
gone
out
of
business.
i
do
know
this,
your
honor,
that
the
record
shows
that
the
rate
of
failure
of
companies
before
the
japanese
in
this
market,
before
the
japanese
companies
entered
and
their
rate
of
failure
afterward
was
actually
greater
before
than
after.
and
as
far
as
mr....
justice
powell
asked
me
about,
or
asked
mr.
rome
about
market
shares,
there
is
a
reference
to
market
shares
in
the
plaintiffs'
own
evidence
at
page
2576a
of
the
record,
and
it
picks
up
at
the
year
1969,
and
zenith's
market
share
was
21.1.
at
the
end
of
the
period
relevant,
or
the
period
raised
by--
mr.
donald
j.
zoeller
--these
plaintiffs,
it
was
22
percent.
mr.
donald
j.
zoeller
the
other
plaintiff
had
gone
out
of
business
in
the
year
1970,
and
that
other
plaintiff
was
one
of,
as
far
as
this
record
shows,
a
number
of
companies
that--
mr.
donald
j.
zoeller
--didn't
make--
mr.
donald
j.
zoeller
--on
this
record,
your
honor,
we
have
argued
on
summary
judgment
only
the
issue
of
liability.
we
have
not
addressed
the
issue
of
damage
either
in
the
court
below
or
in
the
court
of
appeals,
or
not
do
we
address
it
at
this
court.
it
simply
is
not
raised
by
the
motion
for
summary
judgment,
which
raises
itself
to
the
more
basic
issue
of
liability.
thank
you.
