mr.
charles
f.
rule
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case,
we
believe,
is
an
unfortunate
example
of
the
distortion
of
the
antitrust
laws
by
competitors
to
thwart
competition;
precisely
the
sort
of
case
that
the
rules
of
cities
service
were
created
for.
it's
important
to
note
and
remember
the
background
of
this
case
in
our
view.
after
nine
years
of
discovery,
seven
different
judges,
hundreds
of
depositions
and
literally
hundreds
of
thousands
of
documents,
district
judge
becker
took
several
months
to
sift
through
the
evidence
very
carefully
and
wrote
a
430
page
opinion
granting
the
petitioners'
motion
for
summary
judgment
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
reasonable
inference
that
could
be
drawn
from
all
the
evidence
of
a
low
price
conspiracy
that
injured
the
respondents.
mr.
charles
f.
rule
the
court
of
appeals
did
reverse
judge
becker
as
to
a
number
of
evidentiary
motions;
however,
judge--
mr.
charles
f.
rule
--yes,
sir.
judge
becker,
though,
in
deciding
the
summary
judgment
motions,
in
effect
assumed,
arguendo,
that
certain
evidence
was
admissible.
moreover,
when
you
look
at
the
evidence
that
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
in
reversing
judge
becker,
and
when
you
distill
it
down
to
its
essence,
essentially
you
have
four
facts
that
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on.
the
respondents
have
characterized
those
facts
in
various
ways
to
make
the
list
look
a
little
broader
and
bigger,
but
the
fact
is
there
are
four
facts.
and
because
there
was
direct
evidence
as
to
at
least
two
of
those
facts,
the
court
felt
that
it
didn't
have
to
apply
the
rules
of
inference
drawing
of
cities
service.
however,
i
think
when
you
look
at
those
four
facts,
either
individually
or
together,
the
four
facts
are
not
even
probative
circumstantial
evidence
of
an
agreement
to
charge
low
prices
in
the
united
states
that
injured
the
respondents,
much
less
direct
evidence
of
such
an
agreement:
therefore,
cities
services
requires
summary
judgment.
those
four
facts
are
essentially
these.
first,
there
was
an
agreement,
let's
assume,
to
stabilize
price
in
a
protected
japanese
market;
that
is,
the
japanese
got
together,
the
petitioners
in
this
case,
to
fix
prices,
hold
them
up
at
higher
levels.
they
were
protected
from
competition
from
foreign
parties.
now,
that
very
well
have
injured
japanese
consumers,
but
no
one,
including
the
respondents,
would
argue
that
that's
an
american
antitrust
violation.
next,
the
court
relied
on
japanese
mandated
export
control
arrangements
and
so-called
check
price
agreements,
which
fixed
the
minimum
export
prices
below
which
the
petitioners
were
not
to
sell
in
the
united
states,
and
the
so-called
five
company
rule,
which
established
that
the
petitioners
could
only
sell
to
five
customers
in
the
united
states,
although
one
of
those
customers
could
be
their
subsidiary
who
could
in
turn
resell
to
almost
anyone
in
this
country.
if
these
agreements
were
effective
at
all,
and
i
think
that
even
respondents
recognize
that
they
were
less
effective
than
the
japanese
would
have
liked,
the
effect
of
those
agreements
was
simply
to
keep
prices
higher
in
the
united
states
to,
in
effect,
reduce
the
competitive
vigor
of
japanese
manufacturers
in
this
market,
and
while
that
may
be
objectionable
under
the
antitrust
laws,
it
certainly
doesn't
create
the
sort
of
antitrust
violation
that
the
respondents
have
alleged,
in
that
indeed
they
must
prove
to
establish
injury
that
they
are
entitled
to
claim
under
the
antitrust
laws.
moreover,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief--
mr.
charles
f.
rule
--no.
there's--
mr.
charles
f.
rule
--two
more,
actually.
i
view
the
mandated
export
program
as,
in
effect,
one
factor,
although
there
may
have
been
various--
mr.
charles
f.
rule
--right,
which
was
part
of
that
program,
and
those
agreements
were
also
compelled,
in
effect,
by
the
government
of
japan
as
it's
indicated
twice
to
the
court.
the
third
fact
is
the
secret
rebates
that
were
not
disclosed
by
petitioners.
in
effect,
the
petitioners
engaged
in,
so
the
court
said,
more
than
25
different
rebating
schemes
that
resulted
in
prices
varying
from
the
very
lowest
to
the
very
highest.
again,
this
is
more
indicative
of
individuals
evading
regulatory
constraints
that
hampered
their
individual
efforts
to
try
to
compete
in
the
marketplace
and
sell
at
the
lowest
price
possible.
the
final
fact
was
the
allegations
that
the
petitioners
sold
at
dumping
prices
in
the
united
states.
again,
the
petitioners
dispute
that.
even
assuming
that
it's
true,
it's
to
be
expected.
you
had
a
japanese
market
that
was
protected,
where
there
was
a
price
stabilization
agreement;
therefore,
prices
were
artificially
high.
in
the
united
states,
you
had
a
competitive
environment;
no
protected
market.
it's
inevitable
that
prices
would
be
lower
in
the
united
states
than
japan.
it
simply
proves
nothing.
taken
together,
the
inference
is
overwhelming
that
the
evidence
is
indicative
of
individual
competitors
responding
unilaterally
and
vigorously
to
market
forces;
in
effect,
their
new
entrance,
the
petitioners,
through
the
relevant
time,
trying
to
make
a
place
in
the
market
by
competing
on
the
basis
of
price,
trying
to
develop
customer
loyalty,
that
sort
of
thing.
now,
that
may
have
injured
the
respondents,
but
that's
competition,
and
competition
is
what
the
antitrust
laws
are
designed
to
promote,
not
to
thwart.
we
believe
that
the
third
circuit's
decision
offers
strong
encouragement,
if
it's
upheld,
to
beleaguered
competitors
seeking
protection
from
the
vigors
of
competition,
and
we
think
that's
precisely
the
wrong
thing
that
the
antitrust
laws
should
do.
the
threat
of
treble
damages
and
never-ending
litigation
such
as
this
is
precisely
the
sort
of
thing
that
can,
in
effect,
undermine
the
competitive
enthusiasm
of
very
efficient
firms
and
result
in
the
perversion
of
prices
and
competition
that
the
antitrust
laws
were
designed
to
prevent.
we
are
very
much
concerned,
the
united
states
government,
about
this
case
and
about
the
abuse
it
pretends
for
the
law.
to
the
extent
the
protection
of
domestic
industries
from
foreign
competition
is
necessary,
there
is
an
extensive
body
of
trade
laws
with
safeguards
to
do
precisely
that.
it
seems
to
us
that
unless
the
courts
are
willing
and
able
to
enter
summary
judgment
in
suits
such
as
this,
respect
for
the
antitrust
laws
at
home
and
abroad
will
be
seriously
eroded.
for
all
these
reasons,
including
as
i
have
indicated
the
fact
that
we
believe
the
statements,
two
statements,
by
the
japanese
government,
that
they
compelled
the
export
control
arrangements,
the
five
company
rule
and
the
check
price
agreement,
and
that
therefore
evidences
to
those
agreements
cannot
be
the
basis
of
liability
against
the
petitioners,
that
for
all
these
reasons
the
court
should
reverse
the
third
circuit
and
reinstate
the
summary
judgment
on
dismissing
respondents'
antitrust
claims.
thank
you.
