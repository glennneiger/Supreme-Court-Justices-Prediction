mr.
edwin
p.
rome
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
at
the
argument
below
which
lasted
two
full
days,
counsel
for
petitioners
here
said
that
what
the
court
had
to
do
was
to
look
at
the
record.
that's
what
the
case
is
all
about.
the
court
of
appeals
did
exactly
that
over
a
period
of
fourteen
months,
examining
a
record
of
some
18,000
pages,
as
its
lengthy
opinion
shows
in
detail,
and
decided
unanimously
that
there
are
disputed
issues
of
material
fact
which
preclude
the
grant
of
summary
judgment
to
petitioners
here.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
respondents
are
entitled
to
have
a
trial
on
the
merits.
after
12
years
of
the
most
arduous
effort
in
which
we
had
to
overcome
every
possible
and
conceivable
defensive
tactic,
the
court
of
appeals
reached
its
decision
after
reversing
most
of
the
evidentiary
rulings
of
the
district
court
and
after
a
careful
consideration
of
the
restated
evidentiary
record,
much
of
which
came
from
the
files
of
the
petitioners
themselves.
in
doing
so,
the
court
of
appeals
applied
the
appropriate
standards
of
sufficiency
or
evidence
of
a
sherman
act
conspiracy
and
correctly
drew
all
reasonable
inferences
in
favor
of
respondents
who
were
the
opponents
of
the
summary
judgment
motions.
in
fact,
the
court
below
tested
the
respondents'
evidence
by
an
unusually
stringent
standard
under
rule
56
of
the
federal
rules.
thus,
the
court
of
appeals
ignored
the
fact
that
petitioners'
summary
judgment
motions
were
inadequately
based,
in
that
on
their
own
application
to
the
district
court
they
had
been
relieved
from
filing
their
final
pretrial
statement
setting
forth
their
view
of
the
evidence
in
the
record.
under
the
normal
summary
judgment
procedures,
this
would
alone
have
been
sufficient
to
require
their
motions
to
be
denied.
instead,
the
court
tested
the
sufficiency
of
the
respondents'
evidence,
sifted
through
the
massive
factual
record
for
the
l4
months,
and
upheld
unanimously
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
in
addition,
respondents'
unrebutted
expert
economic
reports
evidence
analyzing
the
admissible
evidence
and
concluding
that
it
pointed
only
to
collusion
is
dispositive,
we
respectfully
submit,
on
summary
judgment.
now,
petitioners
argue
that
the
concept
of
sovereign
compulsion
insulates
them
from
liability
for
the
wrongful
acts
done
in
the
united
states
which
restrained
the
interstate
and
foreign
commerce
of
the
united
states.
this,
with
great
respect
for
my
friends,
is
a
false
issue
belatedly
raised
and
is
based
on
an
obvious
misinterpretation
of
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
and
did.
the
solicitor
general,
in
his
brief,
acknowledges
and
concedes
that
sovereign
compulsion
is
an
affirmative
defense,
yet
it
was
not
raised
by
petitioners
in
their
answers
to
the
complaints
with
the
exception
of
melko,
which
posed
it
in
the
context
of
questioning
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
but
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
have
upheld
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
which
holdings
are
not
questioned
in
this
court.
sovereign
compulsion
was
not
discussed
by
the
district
court
and
was
not
briefed
or
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals,
again
except
by
melko
in
the
context
of
a
question
as
to
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
in
fact,
counsel
for
petitioners,
my
friend
here,
told
the
court
of
appeals
that
sovereign
compulsion
was
of
no
importance
on
the
appeal
and
was
not
being
pressed
by
petitioners.
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
decision
cited
specific
reasons
why
summary
judgment
on
the
ground
of
sovereign
compulsion
was
not
possible,
the
most
important
being
that
petitioners
simply
did
not
do
what
they
say
the
ministry
of
international
trade
and
industry
in
japan
directed
them
to
do.
and
that
is
unquestionably
the
fact,
because
miti
did
not
direct
the
petitioners
to
dump
or
to
lie
to
the
u.s.
customs
on
the
thousands
of
entry
documents
about
their
prices
in
the
united
states,
or
to
lie
to
the
u.s.
treasury
about
their
prices
in
their
responses
to
the
government
proceedings
and
to
the
antidumping
act
of
1921,
or
to
sell
their
products
in
the
united
states
below
the
so-called
minimum
or
check
prices,
or
to
pay
millions
of
dollars
in
so-called
difference
money
in
a
myriad
of
secret
ways
in
the
united
states.
moreover,
there
simply
cannot
be
compulsion
since,
under
the
very
japanese
export
and
import
trading
act
on
which
my
friends
rely,
petitioners
had
the
right
to
withdraw
from
the
very
agreements
that
are
here
in
evidence,
which
right
to
withdraw
could
not,
under
the
japanese
statute,
be
unduly
restricted.
that
it
was
intentional
on
their
part
and
not
directed
or
compelled
by
miti
is
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
it
is
admitted
that
the
petitioners
continued
their
course
of
conduct
after
there
was
not
a
renewal
of
the
agreements
and
rules
in
1973.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
sir?
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
yes,
sir.
the
reason
being,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
is
that
the
entire
evidentiary
record
has
to
be
looked
at
as
an
entirety
without
fragmentation,
and
what
we
were
charging
here
is
a
conspiracy
in
restraint
of
trade
and
a
conspiracy
to
monopolize
which
manifested
itself
in
dumping
in
the
united
states.
there
must
not,
we
respectfully
suggest,
be
an
ignoring
of
what
happened
in
the
japanese
market,
and
when
that
is
examined
as
a
unitary
course
of
conduct,
we
then
find
that
there
were
high
prices
admittedly
charged
in
japan
which
indeed
did
enable
the
penetration
of
the
u.s.
market
to
be
undertaken
at
a
lesser
cost
than
would
otherwise
be
the
case.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
no,
sir.
that
is
a
completely
contention
advanced
by
my
friends,
because
in
actuality
it
ignores
the
fact
of
what
was
occurring
in
the
japanese
market
where
they
were
in
a
closed
market
that
no
u.s.
competitor
could
enter--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
--because,
sir,
if
it
had
an
impact
on
the
interstate
and
foreign
commerce
of
the
united
states
and
is
to
be
considered
as
part
of
the
unitary
course
of
conduct,
then
indeed
it
must
be
considered
as
the
court
of
appeals
held
below.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
but
what
they
did,
sir,
was
as
the
result
of
collusion.
it
is
admitted
by
my
friends
that
there
was
indeed
collusion
in
the
japanese
market.
that
conduct
there
was
found
to
have
violated
even
japanese
law,
and
then
what
happened
here
in
the
united
states
was
not
just
the
minimum
prices
that
are
referred
to
in
these
agreements,
but
in
actuality
they
continued
predation
because
they
were
charging
actual
prices
that
were
significantly
lower
in
the
united
states,
with
all
of
them
knowing
that
those
prices
were
lower--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
--their
motive,
indeed,
your
honor,
was
to
take
control,
as
happened,
of
the
u.s.
market
for
consumer
electronic
products,
because...
well,
my
friend
says
that
the
two
leaders
are
still
here,
rca
and
zenith.
there
had
been,
initially
over
20
companies
in
the
u.s.
market,
and
only
two
are
now
left,
and
those
two
have
suffered
losses
so
that
while
they
have
managed
to
survive
despite
the
losses,
they
have
indeed
ended
up
taking
over
the
u.s.
market
with
more
than
50
percent
of--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
--sir,
they
have
been
doing
that
all
of
this
time,
because
the
prices
are
in
fact
dumping
prices,
as
has
been
found
by
the
expert
testimony
which
is
unrebutted;
and
moreover,
their
losses,
which
they
admittedly
suffered
in
the
united
states,
were
protected
by
the
high
prices
that
they
were
getting
in
japan,
and
that
is
the
very
essence
of
dumping--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
--price
discrimination
in
the
two
markets.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
oh,
yes,
sir,
because
it
is
a
restraint
of
trade
and
an
attempt
to
monopolize.
we
do,
indeed,
contend
that
it
violates
the
antitrust
laws
as
well
as
the
separate
antidumping
act
of
1960,
which
issue
is
not
presently
before
your
honors.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
no,
sir.
zenith
attempted,
your
honor,
motorola
attempted,
and
were
unable
to
do
so.
it
is
admitted
on
this
record
that
the
japanese
market
was
closed.
excuse,
me,
sir.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
if
they
had
been
able
to.
there
was
an
ardent
desire
on
their
part
of
american
companies
to
do
that,
but
there
had
not
been
an
ability
to
sell
in
japan,
sir.
that's
undisputed
on
this
record,
showing,
indeed--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
--a
variety
of
both
tariff
and
other
barriers
that
prevented
their
attempting
to
carry
through
their
attempt
to
sell
in
the
u.s.
market.
zenith
made
a
number
of
repeated
efforts,
sir,
and
were
forbidden
the
opportunity
to--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
--to
sell
in
japan,
yes,
sir.
yes
sir.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
we
say
that
the
antidumping
act
is
not
in
issue
because
that
is
something
that
is
still
for
trial
below,
and
although
my
friend
charges
that
the
conspiracy
issue,
if
it
were
to
go
out,
would
take
out
the
antidumping
case.
that
is
not
an
issue
before
this
court,
because
there
is
independent
evidence
of
predatory
intent
and
individual
dumping,
and
that
antidumping
act
claim
is
not
before
this
court.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
if
that
were
so,
i
would
agree,
your
honor.
but
our
respectful
position
is
that
it
does
not
because--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
--only
as
to
the
conspiracy,
sir.
but
there
is
independent
evidence
of
individual
acts
done
by
the
individual
petitioners
over
a
sufficiently
long
period
of
time
that
represents
a
separate
cause
of
action
under--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
--on
the
contrary,
your
honor,
there
are...
is
the
evidence
of
the
experts
in
this
case--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
--but
there
is
also
evidence
of
the
continued
long
period
of
time
in
which
the
prices
charges
were
below
their
own
costs
as
well
as
the
fact
that
their
prices
resulted
in
losses
on
the
part
of
the
companies.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
indeed,
sir.
that
issue
is
not
here.
there
was
no
effort
to
seek
certiorari
as
to
the
cause
of
action
under
the
1916
antidumping
act.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
on
the
contrary,
sir.
i
think
that--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
--well,
sir,
there
is
much
more
evidence
than
that
they
dropped
prices.
there
is
undisputed
evidence
that
they
met
over
a
period
of
years
at
every
level
of
the
hierarchy
and
exchanged
elaborate,
detailed
information
about
production,
about
prices,
and
a
variety
of--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
--it
was
aimed
at
the
american--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
--it
had
the
result,
sir,
of
taking
over
the
american
market,
as
i've
attempted
to
describe,
and
driving
out
of
business
the
national
union
electric
company,
which
is
one
of
the
respondents
here,
along
with
some
18
or
20
other--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
--it
drove
down
prices,
but
that
is
the
very
essence
of
dumping,
and
the
fact
that
it
drove
down
pricing
as
the
result
of
a
combination
in
conspiracy,
and
representing
an
unlawful
act
is
the
very
reason
why
we
are
here--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
--as
a
consumer,
you
may
not
be,
your
honor,
but
in
actuality
the
congress
has
said
that
even
a
low
price,
if
fixed
as
a
result
of
conspiracy,
is
something
that
violates
the
antitrust
laws
of
the
united
states.
it
is
not
sufficient
merely
to
say
that
there
is
a
reasonable
price
being
fixed
or
a
low
price
being
fixed.
it
is
the
very
fact
that
a
price
has
been
fixed
which
runs
counter
to
our
laws,
and
it
is
that
which
makes
the
vice
here.
and,
moreover,
in
this
instance
we
have
a
conspiracy
and
restraint
of
trade
which
manifests
itself
in
dumping,
which
is
a
price
discrimination
in
two
geographic
markets,
which
has
always
historically
been
recognized
as
the
extreme
example
of
predation,
as
it
has
been
under
the
gatt,
the
general
agreement
on
trade,
which
is
a...
to
which
agreement
japan
itself
is
a
signatory,
as
is
the
united
states.
and
that
low
price
is
the
definition
of
dumping.
it
is
a
lower
price
here
than
the
higher
price
in
japan.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
so,
with
respect,
i
think
our
whole
point
is
that
there
has
to
be
an
examination
of
the
entire
evidentiary
record.
i
agree,
if
this
had
only
occurred
in
japan
without
having
an
impact;
if
it
had
not
been
aimed
with
effects
taking
place
in
the
united
states,
it
would
be
a
very
different
case.
but
when
it
does
affect
the
interstate
commerce
of
the
united
states
in
its
foreign
commerce,
then
indeed
it
is
a
situation
as
to
which
all
must
be
concerned,
with
respect,
sir.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
sir?
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
he
did
so
say,
sir.
he
did
so
say,
but
in
actuality
it
is
demonstrated
on
this
record
that
the
pricing
in
the
united
states
has
been
woefully
under...
the
pricing
by
the
petitioners
has
been
woefully
under
the
prices
charged
by
other
competitors
in
the
united
states.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
we
have
maintained
a
degree
brought
but
not
have
been
able
to
go
out
of
separate
losses
because
the
prices
at
which
the
goods
have
been
sold
have
been
sufficiently
depressed.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
yes,
sir.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
yes,
sir.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
i
have
no
recollection,
sir,
that
there
was
any
specific
reference
to
the
position
of
the
respective
market
shares
of
the
respondents
here.
it
should
be
noted
with
regard
to
the
1975
statement
from
the
ministry
of
international
trade
and
industry
on
which
my
friends
rely
that
that
statement
was
sent
five
years
after
the
nue
complaint
was
filed,
eight
months
after
the
zenith
complaint
was
filed,
and
long
after
petitioners
had
filed
their
answers
to
the
complaint,
without
raising
the
affirmative
defense
of
sovereign
compulsion.
that
miti
statement
is
unsigned.
it
purports
to
refer
to
an
alleged
direction
given
13
years
before,
without
saying
by
whom
or
to
whom
it
was
given,
whether
it
was
oral
or
in
writing.
it
makes
no
reference
whatever
to
the
right
on
the
part
of
the
petitioners
to
withdraw
or
to
their
right
of
appeal,
nor
is
there
any
statement
from
japan's
highest
legal
officer
stating
the
consequences
under
japanese
law.
and
the
miti
statement--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
--no,
sir.
what
i'm
attempting
to
suggest
is
that
the
issue
of
sovereign
compulsion
is
not
properly
in
our
respectful
submission
before
the
court
because,
number
one,
even
if
it
be
assumed
that
miti
mandated
or
directed
the
petitioners
to
do
something,
they
did
not
do
what
miti
directed
them
to
do,
as
i've
attempted
to
suggest.
and
i'm
attempting
now
to
turn
my
attention,
if
i
may,
sir,
to
the
diplomatic
communications
which
have
come
from
the
japanese
embassy,
because
the
miti
statement
itself
makes
no
reference
to
the
right
to
withdraw,
and
the
communication
from
the
embassy
of
japan
when
first
transmitted
in
1975
made
no
reference,
however,
to
that.
but
in
1984,
six
months
after
the
court
of
appeals
had
handed
down
its
decision,
then
there
is
again
a
transmittal
of
the
same
1975
miti
statement
by
the
japanese
embassy,
and
then
a
parenthetical
reference
which
seeks
to
import
into
the
1975
statement
a
reference
to
the
five
company
rule
which
is
not
there
in
the
original
statement.
we
say,
therefore,
that
those
diplomatic
communications
do
not
meet
the
normal
criteria
recognized
to
give
effectiveness
to
a
diplomatic
communication,
in
that
they
were
neither
timely
nor
sufficiently
specific.
now,
what
happened
then
is
that
in
addition
to
sovereign
compulsion,
which
we
say
is
a
false
issue,
there
is
indeed
the
further
point
that
even
if
there
had
been
a
mandate
by
miti
of
what
they
did
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
going
back
80
years,
that
would
not
prevent
that
conduct
being
admissible
in
evidence
and
being
a
part
of
the
overall
course
of
conduct
which
is
capable
of
being
shown
to
violate
our
laws,
because
80
years
ago
this
court
said
no
conduct
has
such
an
absolute
privilege
as
to
justify
all
possible
schemes
of
which
it
may
be
a
part.
the
most
innocent
and
constitutionally
protected
facts
may
be
made
a
step
in
a
criminal
plot,
and
it
is...
if
it
is
a
step
in
a
plot,
neither
its
innocence
nor
the
constitution
is
sufficient
to
prevent
the
punishment
of
the
plot
by
law.
our
contention,
therefore,
is
that
if
constitutionally
protected
conduct,
speech,
may
become
a
part
in
a
scheme
which
violates
the
law
and
force
your
right,
this
purported
unspecific
mandate
from
miti
may
similarly
be
so
considered.
a
word
should
be
added
here,
if
i
may,
about
the
position
advanced
by
the
brief
of
the
solicitor
general
that
although
the
government
prosecuted
these
same
petitioners
for
many
years
under
the
1921
antidumping
act,
ultimately
successfully,
in
which
proceedings
neither
the
petitioners
nor
the
japanese
government
ever
raised
the
defense
of
sovereign
compulsion,
the
u.s.
government
in
its
brief
now
argues
inconsistently
against
the
respondents
pursuing
their
private
rights
of
action
against
the
same
petitioners
for
the
same
course
of
conduct.
it
is
suggested
by
the
solicitor
general's
brief
that
sovereign
compulsion
should
not
be
available
in
the
action
brought
by
the
u.s.
government,
but
that
it
should
be
limited
in
its
applicability
to
suits
by
private
litigants.
this
novel
contention,
we
suggest,
is
unprecedented,
and
runs
afoul
not
only
of
the
long
recognition
by
this
court
that
the
private
litigant
has
been
a
bulwark
of
the
enforcement
of
the
antitrust
laws,
but
also
of
the
specific
grant
by
the
congress
of
private
rights
of
action.
if
there
is
to
be
a
change
in
that
law,
it
should
be
legislated
by
the
congress,
we
respectfully
suggest,
not
in
response
to
a
rather
casual
reference
in
an
amicus
brief.
but
in
similar
fashion,
petitioners'
formulation
of
the
conspiracy
issue
in
terms
of
alleged
parallel
acts
and
other
circumstantial
evidence
is
again
a
false
issue
in
our
view
and
a
misstatement
of
what
the
circuit
court
said
and
did.
the
court
below
expressly
said
that
this
is
not
simply
a
parallel
action
case,
nor
is
it
one
based
on
circumstantial
evidence
alone.
on
the
contrary,
the
circuit
court
carefully
distinguished
the
line
of
cases
based
on
conscious
parallelism
from
this
case,
which
presents
a
record
in
which
there
is
both
direct
evidence
of
certain
kinds
of
concert
of
action
and
circumstantial
evidence
which
suggests
certain
other
kinds
of
concert
of
action.
the
court
of
appeals
expressly
said
that
thus
none
of
those
conscious
parallelism
cases
can
be
dispositive
on
the
propriety
of
summary
judgment
in
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
followed
the
direction
of
this
court
in
refusing
to
fragment
the
evidence
and
examined
all
the
admissible
evidence,
both
direct
and
circumstantial,
in
the
restated
evidentiary
record
to
determine
what
legitimate
inference
could
be
drawn
as
to
the
ultimate
facts
in
issue.
contrary
to
the
contentions
by
my
friends,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
create
an
exception
to
the
rule
in
cities
service,
which
was
a
totally
different
case.
there,
in
cities
service,
was
not
a
horizontal
price
fixing
case.
petitioners
in
cities
service
were
not
competitors.
it
was
conceded
there
that
the
interests
of
cities
service
were
directly
opposed
to
those
of
the
other
defendants.
mr.
justice
marshall
noted
that
the
record
cited
an
overwhelming
amount
of
evidence
as
to
cities
service
motives,
which
evidence
came
from
cities
service
itself.
in
that
case,
the
only
evidence
there
cited
was
the
refusal
to
buy,
while
in
our
case
there
is
extensive
evidence,
both
direct
and
circumstantial,
of
collusion,
meetings
at
all
levels,
exchanges
of
all
kinds
of
information,
including
price
information,
aimed
at
the
u.s.
market
and
carefully
coordinated
concealed
activities
that
leave
no
doubt
about
petitioners'
conscious
commitment
to
a
common
scheme
to
achieve
an
unlawful
objective.
whereas,
cities
service
made
a
conclusive
showing
on
its
part,
in
actuality
what
happened
here
below
was
that
there
was
no
showing
by
the
petitioners
at
all,
because
as
i
have
said
they
were
relieved
on
their
own
application
by
the
district
court
of
any
obligation
to
file
their
final
pretrial
statement.
mr.
justice
marshall,
in
cities
service,
said
the
question
whether
summary
judgment
is
appropriate
in
any
case
is
one
to
be
decided
upon
the
particular
facts
of
that
case.
here,
petitioners
simply
ignore
the
vastly
different
evidentiary
record
of
our
case
in
their
reliance
upon
the
inapposite
facts
of
cities
service.
petitioners'
response
to
the
undisputed
record
is
to
argue
that
the
direct
evidence
of
their
collusive
conduct
in
japan
relates
to
a
different
conspiracy
from
the
one
alleged
by
the
respondents.
they
seek,
thereby,
to
impermissibly
fragment
their
unitary
course
of
conduct,
the
single
conspiracy
that
we
have
charged,
into
two
separate
conspiracies
and
to
argue
that
what
they
did
in
japan
is
nonactionable.
the
reason
why
they
say
it
is
nonactionable
is
because
of
the
alleged
mandate
from
miti,
which
i
have
attempted
to
refer
to
in
my
argument
about
sovereign
compulsion.
whatever
miti
directed
the
petitioners
to
do
lost
its
exempt
character
when
it
became
part
of
petitioners'
common
design
and
understanding
regarding
their
conduct
outside
of
japan
which
affected
the
interstate
and
foreign
commerce
of
the
u.s.,
and
in
any
event,
their
conduct
and
agreements
in
japan
are
admissible
in
our
case
to
illuminate
the
character
and
effect
of
their
conduct
in
the
united
states.
moreover,
their
attempt
to
fragment
the
record
into
different
conspiracies
and
to
take
up
each
piece
of
evidence
item
by
item,
scrutinize
it,
and
then
wipe
the
slate
clean
runs
counter
to
the
dictate
of
this
court
in
continental
ore.
the
entire
body
of
evidence
must
be
viewed
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
respondents
to
give
them
the
benefit
of
all
inferences
which
the
evidence
fairly
supports
even
the
contrary
inferences...
even
though
contrary
inferences
might
reasonably
be
drawn.
nor
was
it
permissible
for
the
district
court
to
attempt,
as
it
did,
to
decide
which
reasonable
inferences
are
the
more
probable,
because
as
has
been
said
in
tennant,
cited
again
in
continental
ore,
it
is
not
the
function
of
the
court
to
search
the
record
for
conflicting
circumstantial
evidence
nor
to
take
the
case
away
from
the
jury
on
a
theory
that
the
proof
gives
equal
support
to
inconsistent
and
uncertain
inferences.
petitioners
have
not
really
challenged,
because
they
cannot
challenge
our
statement
of
the
procedural
history
of
this
case
and
the
careful
detailed
reference
to
the
factual
record.
the
conclusory
arguments
of
lawyers
cannot
prevail
over
the
particular
facts
of
this
case
established
by
evidence
held
to
be
admissible,
which
evidentiary
rulings
are
not
subject
of
attack
here
before
your
honors,
and
when
it
is
all
examined
together
without
fragmenting,
we
saw
that
it
reasonably
tends
to
prove
that
petitioners
had
a
conscious
commitment
to
a
common
scheme
designed
to
achieve
an
unlawful
objective,
and
therefore
the
court
below
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you,
sir.
