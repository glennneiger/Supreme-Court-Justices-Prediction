mr.
zoeller,
do
you
think
the
cities
service
case
laid
down
a
rule
of
inference
drawing
through
summary
judgment
that's
peculiar
to
antitrust
law,
or
does
it
apply
across
the
board
in
summary
judgment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
to
that
extent
then,
if
you
just
had
an
ordinary
action
for
fraud
and
not
antitrust,
i
suppose
you
would
say
cities
service
didn't
apply
because
there's
no
harm
in
showing
fraud.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
your
questions
presented,
your
petition,
raises
anything
about
the
dumping
charges?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
rome?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there's
a
certain
tendency,
i
think,
on
the
part
of
your
briefs.
they're
going
to
pass
in
the
night;
namely,
yours
and
your
opponents'.
in
their...
in
your
opponents'
description
of
your
case,
they
say
that
respondents
alleged
that
from
the
mid-50s
to
at
least
1977,
you
claimed
seven
japanese
television
manufacturers
and
17
other
named
defendants
participated
in
a
low
price
export
conspiracy
to
destroy
their
competitors
and
take
over
the
u.s.
market
for
television
receivers.
now,
is
that
a
reasonably
accurate
description
of
your
claim?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
a
necessary
element
of
your
claim
that
eventually
these
people
would
have
to
recoup
their
losses?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
how
does
that
bear
on
a
claim
of
the
american
antitrust
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
supposing
your
evidence
of
what
happened
in
this
country
shows
nothing
more
than
that
these
people
constantly
lowered
their
prices
and
met
competition
and
tried
to
compete
so
heavily
as
to
become
the
only
people
and
the
only
suppliers
in
the
american
market?
now,
if
that
proof...
if
there's
nothing
more
than
that,
now
can
showing
something
that
happened
in
the
japanese
market
fortify
that
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
was
their
motive?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
surely
they
didn't
take
over
the
u.s.
market
with
the
intent
to
just
continue
dumping
and
charging
low
prices,
did
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--does
that
state
a
claim
under
the
antitrust
laws?
