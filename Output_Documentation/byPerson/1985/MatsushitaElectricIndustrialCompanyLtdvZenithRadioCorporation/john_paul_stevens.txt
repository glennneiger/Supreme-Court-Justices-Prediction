mr.
zoeller,
in
your
view,
is
the
evidence
about
what
happened
in
the
japanese
market
entirely
irrelevant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
the
evidence
about
sharing
the
figures
on
production
and
inventories
entirely
irrelevant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
the
production
figures
showed
that
they
produced
much
more
than
they
consumed
in
japan.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
evidence
explain
why
they
exchanged
this
information
about
production
and
inventory?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just...
you
focus
our
attention
on
that
page.
the
court
says
direct
evidence
of
some
kinds
of
concert
of
action
like
price
fixing
in
japan
may
be
circumstantial
evidence
of
a
broader
conspiracy.
do
you
agree
or
disagree
with
that
statement
of
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
rule,
perhaps
i
should
have
asked
your
opponent,
but
do
i
correctly
recall
that
the
district
judge
held
a
great
deal
of
evidence
inadmissible
that
the
court
of
appeals
said
was
admissible,
so
the
court
of
appeals
decided
the
case
on
a
different
record?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
most
of
its
opinion
deals
with
evidentiary
ruling.
