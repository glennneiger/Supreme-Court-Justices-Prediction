unknown
speaker
but
this
is--
unknown
speaker
were
the
american
companies
selling
in
competition
with
the
japanese
in
japan?
unknown
speaker
if
japan
had
these
inflated
prices,
couldn't
the
american
producers
have
returned
the
compliments?
unknown
speaker
i'm
trying
to
get
at
the
reason.
what
was
the
reason?
unknown
speaker
to
sell
in
japan,
you
mean?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
did
you
say
was
not
at
issue
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
that
if
reversing
the
judges
below
with
respect
to
the
antitrust
case
nevertheless
rubs
off
on
the
dumping
case,
then
it--
unknown
speaker
--well,
the
other
side
says
it
does,
so
you
disagree
on
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
your
view
of
the
evidence.
of
course,
i
gathered
from
what
your
opposition
said
that
if
you
take
away
the
conspiracy
evidence,
there's
just
no
evidence
of
any
kind
of
a
predatory
intent,
individual
or
joint.
unknown
speaker
yes,
i
know.
that's
your
position
about
the
evidence.
unknown
speaker
so,
i
gather
if
we
happen
to,
if
we
reverse
the
lower
court
on
the
antitrust
case,
you
would...
you
think
we
should
say
that
this
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
dumping
case?
unknown
speaker
and
if
we
don't
agree
with
you
on
the
predatory
action,
you
can't
win,
can
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
can
you
win
when
the
only
evidence
is
that
they
dropped
prices?
unknown
speaker
what
effect
did
that
have
on
the
american
market?
unknown
speaker
what
effect
did
it
have?
unknown
speaker
and
it
also
drove
down
prices,
too.
unknown
speaker
as
a
consumer,
why
am
i
worried
about
a
drop
in
prices?
unknown
speaker
and
i'm
worried
about
the
prices
in
japan.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
this
question?
unknown
speaker
did
i
understand
your
competitor
to
say
that
your
clients
had
not
lost
share
of
market
over
the
past
15
to
20
years?
unknown
speaker
but
my
question
was
whether
or
not
your
clients
have
lost
share
of
market?
unknown
speaker
you
maintain
the
market
share
by
cutting
your
prices
to
beat
the
predatory
prices?
unknown
speaker
that's
your
position?
unknown
speaker
did
the
court
of
appeals
expressly
find
that?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
there
has
to
be
some
fact
finding
with
respect
to
that
statement,
or
not?
unknown
speaker
mr.
zoeller,
do
you
contend
that
recoupment
is
an
essential
part
of
the
cause
of
action?
unknown
speaker
would
proof
that
sales
were
below
cost
tend
to
prove
that
conclusion?
unknown
speaker
--thesis,
is
it
true
that
some
17
or
18
companies
have
gone
out
of
business
in
the
american
market?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
other
plaintiff?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
other
plaintiff?
unknown
speaker
and
even
as
to
zenith--
unknown
speaker
--as
i
read
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
they
say
that
you
conceded
the
fact
of
damage;
that
there
was
enough
evidence.
i
don't
mean
you
conceded
on
the
merits,
but
that
you
didn't
contend
that
the
record
was
deficient
with
regard
to
proof
of
damage,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
10
o'clock.
