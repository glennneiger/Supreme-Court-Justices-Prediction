justice
john
paul
stevens
--let
me
just
ask
at
this
point,
doesn't
the
escrow,
which
you
seem
to
be
satisfied
with,
doesn't
that
also
frustrate
the
governmental
interest
during
the
period
required
to
make
the
determination?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
agree
that
the
objector
has
the
constitutional
right
to
have
the
determination
of
the
fair,
whatever
the
allocation
may
be,
at
some
point
be
made
by
an
independent
decisionmaker?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
take
the
position
that
that
could
be
just
the
state
judicial
system
that
if
you
put
everything
in
escrow
and
then
waited
whatever
time
it
takes
the
illinois
courts
to
decide
the
case,
that
would
be--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--say
the
illinois
courts
take
five
or
six
years
to
run
the
route
of
going
through
the
circuit
court,
the
court
of
appeals,
and
all
the
rest,
and
all
the
money
sits
in
escrow
for
six
years.
every
year
you
have
to
do
this.
would
that
still
be
constitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
say
that
system
would
be
constitutionally
sufficient
even
if
the
union
provided
no
internal
mechanism
whatsoever
for
review,
if
they
just
off
the
top
of
their
heads
said,
we'll
take
98
percent
this
year,
we
won't
have
any
review,
you
just
have
to
sue
us
in
court
and
we'll
hold
all
the
money
in
escrow?
is
there
any
constitutional
obligation
to
do
anything
except
respond
to
litigation
and
hold
money
in
escrow?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
the
state's
outer
limit
isn't
much
of
a
limit.
it's
100
percent
of
union
dues,
and
by
hypothesis
some
of
that
percentage
is
used
for
non-union
purposes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
as
i
understand
you,
maybe
i'm
wrong,
mr.
gold,
but
i
think
you
in
effect
have
not
challenged
the
analysis
of
the
court
of
appeals
if
there
were
no
escrow
agreement.
it
seems
to
me
you
have
more
or
less
assumed
there
must
be
either
an
independent
decisionmaker
or
an
escrow
if
the
objector's
money
is
to
be
used
pending
the
determination
of
how
much
should
be
used.
say
we
had
no
escrow
in
this
case.
would
you
still
challenge
the
court
of
appeals'
analysis
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
that
the
practicality,
i
suppose,
is
because
of
the
problem
of
collecting
from
people
who
don't
pay
their
share,
is
that
you
have
to
make
the
95
percent.
you
have
to
have
a
figure
that
you're
going
to
be
reasonably
sure
you're
going
to
get
your
money
from
the
objectors.
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
of
which...
i
don't
mean
to
retrace
ground,
but
all
of
which
comes
back
to
a
question
justice
o'connor
asked
earlier.
not
only
might
it
be
in
the
objector's
interest,
but
it
may
also
be
in
the
union's
interest
to
have
an
independent
audit
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
as
early
as
possible.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
vieira,
supposing
they
went
to
the
state
legislature
in
springfield
and
said,
we
have
an
expense...
a
free
rider
problem,
we
have
an
expense
of
representing
non-members
as
well
as
members,
and
we
can
demonstrate
to
the
legislature
that
substantially
all
of
the
dues
is
required
for
this
duty,
an
amount
roughly
equal
to
that,
and
the
legislature,
say
it
made
an
express
finding...
they
didn't
here...
that
we
think
generally
speaking
the
dues
is
a
fair
summary
of
what
the
costs
are
involved,
so
we'll
make
an
initial
payment
of
dues,
and
that's
just
your
contribution,
subject
to
some
right
to
recoup
if
it's
misspent
in
some
way.
why
can't
the
state
legislature
be
the
very
agency
that
you're
saying
has
to
play
a
part
in
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
now
you
go
back
to
the
first
amendment,
and
they
say,
yes,
that's
exactly
right,
and
we'll
hold
the
money
in
escrow
until
we
resolve
the
first
amendment
issues.
and
supposing
they,
instead
of
having
an
internal
procedure,
they
agree
to
an
audit
by
price
waterhouse
or
some
independent
auditing
firm
who
is
acceptable
to
your
clients.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
union,
the
union
agreed
with
your
clients
that
they
would
do
it,
and
then
they
would
refund
the
parts
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
statute's
already
been
passed.
it's
on
the
books.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
doesn't
that
represent
a
legislative
finding
that
substantially
all
of
the
dues
probably
are
required
for
this
purpose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
supposing
they
had
preceded
the
statute
with
a
legislative
finding
at
the
committee
hearings
that
said,
we
find,
based
on
testimony
before
the
legislature,
that
most
of
the
dues...
that
dues
fairly
represents
an
approximation
of
what's
needed
for
this
purpose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
or
95
percent.
in
the
range
of
80
to
90
percent
is
required.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question--
--well,
somebody
did.
i'm
sorry.
would
you
have
the
same
constitutional
objection
if
the
procedure
were
one
that
the
union
financed
an
audit
by
an
independent
arbitrator?
you
didn't
have
the
selection
procedure
now.
say
you
had
an
independent
decisionmaker
and
the
cost
was
entirely
borne
by
the
union
and
they
had
some
kind
of
procedure
where
they
could
get
a
decision
in
three
months
or
something.
i
should
think
the
audit
could
be
done
in
a
reasonable
period
of
time
if
it
were
done
by
an
independent
auditor.
what
would
be
the
constitutional
objection
to
such
a
procedure?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
be
in
escrow
until
whatever
it
would
take
to
complete
the
audit,
and
then
they
divide
it
up,
whatever
the
auditor
said.
you'd
always
have
a
chance
to
litigate
later
on,
i
suppose,
whether--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
assume
for
the
moment
that
they
did
present
to
the
legislature
a
fairly
strong
showing
that
a
substantial
percentage
of
the
money
would
be
used
for
collective
bargaining.
and
they
say,
pending
the
decision
by
an
independent
decisionmaker
what
percentage
is
appropriate,
we'll
collect
it
so
we're
sure
we'll
get
it,
that
these
people
won't
lose
their
jobs
or
die
or
something
and
they
have
trouble
collecting.
and
we'll
put
it
in
escrow
and
leave
it
there
for
90
days
while
a
decision
is
made,
and
then
we'll
divide
it
up.
what
would
be
the
constitutional
objection
to
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
vieira,
you
use
the
term
"irrational".
don't
you
have
a
check
of
a
mind
because
at
least
you
have
the
union
membership
agreeing
to
pay
certain
dues
periodically?
and
presumably
they're
not
just
throwing
their
money
away.
they
must
think
they
get
something
for
their
dues.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
presumably
a
significant
part
of
it
must
be,
because
isn't
that
the
principal
function
that
a
union
performs
for
its
membership?
justice
john
paul
stevens
don't
you
have
any
idea
what
they
do?
is
that
a
total
secret?
i
mean,
this
is
a
fairly
well-known
union.
they're
in
the
newspapers
a
lot.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
do
represent
the
teachers
of
chicago.
