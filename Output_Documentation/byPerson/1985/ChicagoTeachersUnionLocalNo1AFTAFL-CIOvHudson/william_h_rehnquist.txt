justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
say
the
court
of
appeals
said
that,
even
though
the
substantive
result
reached
was
right,
there
still
was
a
procedural
component
that
was
separate
from
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
the
illinois
courts
give
the
same
sort
of
deference
to
an
arbitrator's
decision
that
the
federal
courts
under
the
labor
act
do?
would
that
still
amount
to
access
to
a
judicial
officer
for
purposes
of
your
answer?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
after
five
or
six
years
of
the
sort
of
hearings
that
you
propose,
in
each
of
which
it
has
come
out
that,
in
one
year
it
was
89,
the
other
year
it
was
91,
the
next
year
it
was
90,
so
that
you
have
a
five
or
six-year
experience
that
shows
you're
within
a
range
of
90
percent,
varying
by
only
one
or
two
percent,
then
could
the
legislature
enact
the
sort
of
statute
that
justice
stevens
says?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
sort
of
challenge?
was
there
evidence
to
support
the
conclusion
that
90
percent
is
a
fair--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
why
couldn't
the
legislature
make
the
same
judgment
as
the
agency
did?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
but
they
can
make
the
judgment
that
there's
no
reason
that
we
think
the
future
will
be
any
different
than
the
past,
so
there'll
be
at
least
a
presumption
that
the
same
amount
will
obtain.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
a
presumption
which
would
entitle
the
union
to
deduct
that
amount
of
dues.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
put
it
in
escrow.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
we
just
were
discussing--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
it
be
a
school
official?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
would
think
the
school
board
which
bargains
with
the
union
might
have
as
good
at
least
a
way
of
getting
knowledge
as
any
other
governmental
agency.
