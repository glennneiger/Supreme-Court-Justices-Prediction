justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
gold,
i
thought
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
indicate,
though,
that
some...
give
some
opinion
as
to
what
could
be
included
in
the
share
that
the
employee
would
have
to
pay?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
pretty
substantive,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
think
that
was
just
gratuitous
dicta?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
some
arbitrator,
if
this
procedure
holds,
would
probably
follow
it,
wouldn't
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
be
affirmed.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
would
still
be
the
question
of
whether
the
individual
has
to
pay
anything
while
that
determination
goes
on.
and
if
he
has
to
pay
anything,
what
would
it
be?
if
he
pays
the
full
amount
that
the
union
tells
him
to
pay,
you
haven't
solved
a
great
deal.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
pending
the
decision
as
to
how
much
you
should
pay.
justice
byron
r.
white
anything
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
union's
interests.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
may
never
be
able
to
recover
it,
because
you
may
not
be
able
to
go
back,
go
back
and
collect
what
you--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
didn't
the
union
just
put
in
the
escrow
arrangement
after
the
case
started?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
did
the
court
of
appeals
invalidate
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
didn't
give
it
much
attention?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't...
you
wouldn't
say
that...
did
you
answer
justice
stevens
that
you
think
the
escrow
arrangement
is
constitutionally
required?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
may
be
so,
but
suppose
the
union
purported
to
establish
a
cushion.
do
you
think
that
there
has
to
be
an
escrow
arrangement
to
make
it
constitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
think
it
was
beside
the
point.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
you
defending
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
defend
needless
complications?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if...
and
i
take
it
then
we
should
just...
you
suggest
we
just
analyze
it
as
a
property
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
say
the
first
amendment
issues
are
all
beside
the
point,
so
it's
a
property
case.
well,
then
you
certainly
don't
need
a
neutral
decisionmaker
to
make
the
decisions
if
it's
just
a
property
case,
i
would
think.
justice
byron
r.
white
you,
i
take
it
you
are
saying
that
you
must
have
a
prior
hearing
or
some
prior
participation
in
the
procedure
before
they
could
take
a
nickel?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
you
would
say
that,
until
that...
until
you
have
exhausted
all
of
your
rights,
they
can't
take
a
nickel.
if
you
wanted
to
take
it
to
court,
you
could
keep
them
from
taking
a
nickel
from
you
until
the
court
procedures
are
through?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
not
necessarily.
i
would
suppose
that
that
must
be
the
logical
bottom
line
for
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
have
some
internal
union
procedures
in
which
non-consenting
employees
can
participate
and
those
procedures
are
exhausted,
and
you
just
disagree
wholly
with
whatever
the
decision
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
you
say
that
you
should
be
able
to
go
to
court
and
have,
pending
trial,
you
should
have
an
injunction
against
collecting
any
money?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
until
that
agency
decided,
they
couldn't
collect
anything?
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
the
odds
are,
though,
that
the
amount
the
union
wants
to
collect,
well,
almost
all
of
it
or
at
least
a
majority
of
it
they
will
be
entitled
to
in
the
long
run.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
that
that
would
be
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
there's
a
perfectly
legitimate
basis
for
saying
that
75
percent,
80,
90
percent
of
it's
going
to
end
up
in
the
union's
hands.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
the
burden
on
the
individual
employee
is
not
very
substantial,
either.
justice
byron
r.
white
he's
going
to
have
to
pay
75
cents
out
of
every
dollar
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
would
concede
that
the
auditor
could
do
it
just
by
himself,
wouldn't
you?
he
wouldn't
have
to
talk
to
you
about
it.
he
wouldn't
have
to
have
a
hearing.
there
wouldn't
be
any
procedures.
the
auditor
just
decides.
justice
byron
r.
white
take
justice
stevens'
example.
would
you
say
that
there
would
have
to
be
a...
the
auditor
would
have
to
take
your
input
to
it
and
have
a
hearing,
with
witnesses?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
suppose
that
the
union
said,
look,
we're
going
to
have
a
procedure
here
where
we're
going
to
end
up
with
an
arbitrator,
an
independent
arbitrator,
as
to
how
much
the
employee
should
pay,
and
pending
that
decision
he
doesn't
have
to
pay
anything.
and
then
the
arbitrator
decides.
is
that
all
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
doesn't
seem
to
accept
that
system.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
it's
under
the
control
of
the
testimony.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
think
the
due
process
employee
of
the
court
of
appeals--
justice
byron
r.
white
--the
due
process
theory
of
the
court
of
appeals
would
apply
whether
the
money
is
collected
before
or
after.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
all
right.
you've
answered
my
question.
if
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
said,
you
don't
defend
it,
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
didn't
think
they
said
that
there
had
to
be
a
procedure
before
any
money
could
be
taken
from
them,
did
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you're
asking
for
an
affirmance
on
a
ground
that
perhaps
goes
beyond
what
the
court
of
appeals
decided.
