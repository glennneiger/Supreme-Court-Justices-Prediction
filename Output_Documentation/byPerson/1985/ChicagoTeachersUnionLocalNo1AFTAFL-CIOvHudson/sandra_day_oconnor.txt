mr.
gold,
may
i
inquire
of
you.
i
suppose
the
court
has
recognized
a
first
amendment
interest
in
non-members
for
use
of
their
money
for
political
purposes.
and
normally
we
would
approach
the
problem
by
saying
that
there
can
be
a
burden
placed
on
them,
all
right.
they'll
have
to
contribute,
but
it
should
be
by
the
least
burdensome
method.
now,
would
it
be
a
less
burdensome
method
here
to
have
an
independent
determination
ahead
of
time
of
the
amount
that
should
be
withheld,
as
opposed
to
the
method
used
here,
which
is
placing
it
in
escrow
and
then
giving
the
non-member
a
right
to
challenge
it
later?
would
it
be
in
your
view
possibly
less
burdensome
if
there
were
some
mechanism
for
an
independent
determination
ahead
of
time?

on
the
first
amendment
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
exactly.
and
so
perhaps
an
independent
determination
at
the
outset
of
what
amount
ought
to
be
withheld
is
the
most
effective
way
and
the
least
burdensome
way
of
meeting
that
obligation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
vieira,
i
have
a
difficult
time
understanding
how
there
could
be
a
due
process
issue
here
that's
independent
of
the
first
amendment
concern.
and
it
would
certainly
seem
to
me
that
whatever
procedures
are
required
for
determining
the
amount
to
be
withheld
are
required
by
the
first
amendment
itself
and
not
the
due
process
clause.
i
really
don't
understand
your
analysis
at
all.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
the
whole
underlying
purpose
of
the
protections
in
the
scheme
that
we're
reviewing.
so
it's
a
little
hard
to
separate
it
out.
