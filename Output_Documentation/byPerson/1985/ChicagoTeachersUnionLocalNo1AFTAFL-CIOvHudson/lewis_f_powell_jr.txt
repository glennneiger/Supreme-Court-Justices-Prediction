justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
excuse
me
for
interrupting,
but
it
would
help
me
if
you
would
clarify
a
response
you
made
to
justice
stevens,
that
you
agreed
that
there
must
be
an
independent
determination
of
an
issue
that
may
be
raised
by
a
non-union
member
as
to
the
use
of
his
or
her
dues.
what
is
the
present
independent
agent
to
which
the
non-member
could
take
his
or
her
complaint?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
there's
nothing...
well,
i
suppose
they
could
go
to
arbitration
and
grievance
procedure,
but
you
don't
suggest
that's
independent?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
would
there
be
any
duty
to
exhaust
that
possible
remedy
before
going
to
court?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
mr.
gold,
how
do
you
differ
with
what
the
court
of
appeals
held?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
did
it
invalidate?
