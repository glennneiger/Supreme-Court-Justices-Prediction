mr.
laurence
gold
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
concerns
the
validity
of
a
system
for
effectuating
an
agency
shop
agreement,
such
agreements
as
the
litigation
to
this
point
in
this
court
shows
are
those
that
provide
that,
where
a
majority
of
an
appropriate
collective
bargaining
unit
has
selected
an
exclusive
bargaining
representative,
all
the
employees
within
the
bargaining
unit
are
required
to
pay
a
sum
equal
to
a
percentage
of
union
dues.
the
litigation
in
this
court
to
this
point
demonstrates
that
the
requirement
of
support
of
all
of
the
employees
for
the
representative
is
constitutionally
appropriate
so
long
as
the
union
uses
the
money
of
individuals
who
file
objections
only
for
matters
relating
to
collective
bargaining
and
attendant
activities.
and
in
the
ellis
v.
railway
clerks
case
in
1984,
the
court
began
the
process,
at
least
under
the
railway
labor
act,
of
specifying
which
of
the
union's
costs
are
chargeable
to
such
objectors
and
which
are
not.
in
this
case,
the
seventh
circuit
confined
itself
to
a
procedural
issue,
and
indeed
the
seventh
circuit
remarked
in
its
opinion
that
the
plaintiffs
below,
the
respondents
in
this
court,
had
predicated
their
challenge
on
procedural
due
process
issues.
the
seventh
circuit
ruled
that
a
system
such
as
the
one
here,
whereby
the
union
calculates
and,
as
the
district
court's
uncontested
findings
state,
carefully
documents
the
portion
of
union
dues
that
represents
the...
and
here
i
quote
the
state
statutory
language...
"the
cost
of
the
collective
bargaining
process
and
contract
administration.
"
and
provides
an
advance
reduction
from
regular
union
dues
based
on
that
calculation,
and
that
furthermore
places
the
payments
of
objectors
who
pay
in
this
reduced
amount
into
an
interest-bearing
escrow
account
pending
the
objector's
use
of
either
an
internal
review
proceeding
within
the
union
which
ends
before
an
arbitrator
selected
from
a
list
maintained
by
the
state
by
the
union,
or
through
judicial
review,
does
not
accord
the
objector
due
process
of
law.
in
other
words,
the
court
held
that,
even
though
the
union
makes
the
calculation
and
provides
an
advanced
reduction
and
backs
up
that
advanced
reduction
by
an
interest-bearing
escrow
account
into
which
is
placed
the
money
of
objectors
while
they
pursue
their
challenges
to
the
union's
calculation,
the
objector
is
not
given
due
process
of
law.
now--
mr.
laurence
gold
--yes,
indeed,
justice
rehnquist.
the
seventh
circuit
said
that
it
needn't
get
into
the
substantive
issue,
that
it
could
assume
that
the
calculation
was
correct
and
that
not
a
penny
of
the
objector's
money
would
be
spent
for
an
impermissible
purpose,
and
nonetheless
there
would
be
a
constitutional
violation
in
this
case.
mr.
laurence
gold
the
court
of
appeals
noted
in
passing
that
the
objector's
rights
included
not
only
a
right
not
to
pay
for
political
and
ideological
activity,
but
also
a
right
not
to
pay
for
any
activity
which
is
not
germane
to--
mr.
laurence
gold
--it
is
substantive,
but
it
isn't
presented
in
this
case,
and
the
court
indicated
as
much,
because
the
state
statute--
mr.
laurence
gold
--i
would
hate
to
use
the
word
"gratuitous",
but
i
certainly
believe
that
the
way
the
seventh
circuit
approached
the
case,
it
was
dictum,
not
only
because
of
what
it--
mr.
laurence
gold
--hopefully,
the
arbitrator
wouldn't
be
faced
with
that
because
the
decision
ought
not
and
we
hope
will
not--
mr.
laurence
gold
--hold.
but
the
seventh
circuit's
position
as
it
articulated
it
is
that
a
procedure
with
the
safeguards
i've
just
outlined
nonetheless
works
a
deprivation
of
the
objector's
liberty
interest,
which
that
court
noted
are
taken
to
or
determined
by
the
objector's
right
of
non-association.
and
it
is
our
position
that
that
ruling
of
the
seventh
circuit
is
erroneous,
that
it
is
contrary
to
the
method
of
approach
this
court
stated
in
abood
versus
the
detroit
federation
of
teachers
in
431
u.s.,
which
is
the
other
public
sector
agency
shop
case
in
this
court,
and
flatly
contrary
to
what
the
court
had
to
say
in
ellis
versus
railway
clerks,
a
1984
decision,
albeit
one
arising
under
the
railway
labor
act.
in
determining
what
due
process
is
required
in
this
case,
and
as
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
recognized,
the
beginning
point
has
to
be
the
nature
of
the
objector's
liberty
interest,
the
nature
of
his
right
of
non-association.
and
this
court
has
spoken
to
the
nature
of
that
interest
and
that
right
in
the
abood
case.
and
in
abood...
and
this
was
foreshadowed
in
earlier
cases
as
well...
the
court
defined
the
objector's
interest
and
his
right
as
not
being
required
to
provide
compulsory
subsidization
of
union
ideological
and
political
activity
not
related
to
collective
bargaining.
and
the
court
has
at
every
point
phrased
its
holdings
as
being
that
the
first
amendment
does
limit
the
uses
to
which
the
union
can
put
funds
obtained
from
dissenting
employees.
that
was
the
phrase
used
in
the
most
recent
case,
in
the
ellis
case.
and
the
court
throughout
has
made
it
plain
that
the
union
shop
and
the
agency
shop
concepts
themselves
are
constitutional
and
that,
as
the
court
put
it
in
one
of
the
earliest
cases,
that
the
mere
collection
of
an
amount
equal
to
or
a
proportion
of
union
dues
does
not
work
any
unconstitutional
deprivation
of
the
objector's
rights,
that
because
of
the
weighty
interests
of
the
government
in
industrial
peace
and
the
governmental
determination
that
equal
support
of
all
employees
in
the
bargaining
unit
of
the
exclusive
representative,
insofar
as
the
exclusive
representative
is
engaging
in
activities
that
are
related
to
or
germane
to
its
functions
as
an
exclusive
representative--
mr.
laurence
gold
--that
approach
would
be
less
burdensome
on
the
individual,
but--
mr.
laurence
gold
--i
don't
believe
that
it
is
fair
to
say
that
it
would
be
less
burdensome
on
the
first
amendment
right
than
the
escrow
system,
because
the
first
amendment
right
is
the
right
not
to
subsidize
a
first
amendment
activity
with
which
one
disagrees.
there
is
another
aspect
to
this
case,
albeit
one
not
treated
below,
which
the
respondents'
brief
is
devoted
to,
namely
a
claim
that
there's
a
burden
on
the
individual's
property
right,
the
right
to
uncontrolled
dominion
of
the
$16
and
i
think
it's
84
cents
per
month
that
is
in
issue
here.
but
i
don't
think
that
the
requirement
that
the
individual
paid
the
money
into
escrow
can
properly
be
said
to
be
a
burden
on
that
individual's
first
amendment
rights.
the
burden
comes
if
the
individual's
money
is
appropriated
to
the
union's
activities.
mr.
laurence
gold
it
isn't...
in
our
view--
mr.
laurence
gold
--you've
solved
several
different--
mr.
laurence
gold
--justice
white,
you've
solved
several
interests.
the
government's
interest
is
that
everybody
in
the
bargaining
unit
pay
the
amount
required
by
the
union
month-in,
month-out,
to
meet
its
collective
bargaining
and
representational
responsibilities.
if
there
has
to
be
a
determination
before
the
individual
pays
anything
in--
mr.
laurence
gold
--yes.
if
that
is
the
requirement,
then
all
the
governmental
interests
are
heavily
and
adversely
impacted
during
the
time
the
determination--
mr.
laurence
gold
--that's
right.
and
it
is...
the
governmental
interest
is
to
permit
the
union
to
fulfil
the
functions
in
the
industrial
relations
system
that
the
government
has
laid
out.
so
if
the
individual,
simply
by
making
an
objection,
can
trigger
a
prior
hearing,
then
all
the
interests
on
the
other
side
of
the
equation
are
sacrificed.
mr.
laurence
gold
that's
right,
and
that's
why,
as
i
was
going
to
note,
in
abood
the
court
said
that
the
proper
approach
here
was
to
prevent
compulsory
subsidization
of
ideological
activity
by
employees
who
object
thereto,
while
not
restricting
the
union's
ability
to
require
every
employee
to
contribute
to
the
costs
of
collective
bargaining
activities.
and
in
furtherance--
mr.
laurence
gold
--it
does
in
part.
in
the
conclusion
of
our
brief,
we
note
that
at
least
an
approach
where
there
is
a
prior
calculation
and
once
there
is
experience,
an
escrow
of
a
limited
amount
based
on
the
experience,
one
that
will
give
a
cushion,
while
permitting
the
union
to
use
the
money,
the
percentage
of
money,
that
in
past
years
had
been
devoted
to
properly
chargeable
activities,
strikes
the
best
balance
between
the
competing
first
amendment
rights
on
both
sides
of
the
equation
and
the
government
interest.
mr.
laurence
gold
we
do.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
that
here,
as
in
any
other
area
that
i
know
of
where
someone
is
making
a
first
amendment
claim,
if
the
states...
if
the
state
provides
an
access
to
the
judicial
system--
mr.
laurence
gold
--as
the
district
court
pointed
out,
at
the
beginning
of
the
process
there
is
going
to
be
some
fair
room
for
dispute
about
whether
this
category
is
chargeable
or
another
category
is
not.
thereafter,
the
likelihood
of
the
type
of
protracted
proceeding
you're
talking
about
is
at
least
less
likely.
but
i
do
have
to
point
out
that
if
the
money
is
in
escrow
or
if
any
substantial
part
of
it
is
in
escrow,
both
sides
are
paying
a
price.
the
majority
has
first
amendment
rights,
too.
there
are
governmental
interests
quite
aside
from
those
first
amendment
rights
on
the
majority's
side.
while
the
money
is
sitting
in
escrow,
those
rights
are
being
limited
in
the
same
way
that
the
objector's
rights
are.
mr.
laurence
gold
i
would
think
that
so
long
as
the
union
on
objection
holds
the
money
in
escrow,
both
the
objector's
liberty
interests
and
the
objector's
property
interests
are
fairly
protected.
let
me
say
in
that
regard
that
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
the
situation
in
which
the
state
says
to
the
union,
you
can
take
from
the
individual
whatever
amount
strikes
you.
the
state
has
placed
a
limit
on
what
the
union
can
seek,
both
by
saying
that
it
cannot
be
more
than
the
union
dues
and
by
setting
out
a
definition
of
what
it
is,
what
type
of
costs
there
are
that
the
union
can
charge
the
objector
for.
in
those
terms,
you
have
the
state
limiting
in
very
sharp
degree
the
area
that
is
open
to
fair
dispute,
and
that
area,
as
the
district
court
pointed
out,
will
continue
to
narrow
once
we
know
more
about
what
the
nature
of
the
law
is
here.
mr.
laurence
gold
no,
i
was
going
to
finish
my
answer,
and
i
thank
you,
justice
marshall.
i
was
going
to
say
that,
if
an
objector
sued
and
was
able
to
prove
that
the
union
in
illinois
made
no
effort
to
limit
the
amount
sought
to
that
which
the
statute
permits,
namely
the
proportionate
share
based
on
the
cost
of
the
collective
bargaining
process
and
contract
administration...
that's
the
state's
statutory
standard.
if
an
objector
proved
that,
i
would
think
that
he
would
be
entitled
to
an
injunction
against
the
collection
of
some
or
all
of
what
was
being
sought.
the
union's
obligation
is
to
seek
and
to
certify,
as
it
did
here,
to
the
employer
making
the
deduction
no
more
than
the
state
permits.
the
reason
that
a
union
that
does
that
is
not
violating
any
of
the
due
process
rights
of
the
individual,
at
least
so
long
as
the
union's
calculation
is
backed
up
by
a
reasonable
escrow--
mr.
laurence
gold
--yes.
mr.
laurence
gold
the
courts
of
the
state
of
illinois.
mr.
laurence
gold
i'm
not
arguing
here
that
the
union's
internal
system
is
one
which
can
replace
the
individual's
right
to
go
to
court.
mr.
laurence
gold
that
would
seem
to
us
to
be
in
the
first
instance
a
question
of
state
law.
there
are
sound
arguments,
at
least
so
long
as
the
union's
process
is
expeditious...
and
the
district
court
noted
here
that
it
can
move
in
75
days...
there
are
sound
considerations
that
might
lead
the
state
court
to
say
that
the
case
will
be
more
rationally
litigated
if
this
process
has
been
used.
mr.
laurence
gold
i
would
have
to
say
that
i
think
a
substantial
question
would
be
raised
if
the
objectors
could
not
get
a
de
novo
determination,
at
least
on
the
category
questions,
namely
what
categories
of
union
activity
is
chargeable.
and
we
make
it
plain
that
we
believe
that
objectors
do
have
that
right.
the
issue
here
is
really
whether
the
rights
that
the
objector
has,
given
the
nature
of
this
liberty
interest,
which
is
not
to
subsidize
and
which
is
protected
by
the
escrow
feature
and
the
right
not
to
have
property
taken
without
due
process,
which
we
think
is
protected
by
the
limit,
the
outer
limit
that
the
state
puts
on
the
amount
that
can
be
taken,
and
which,
when
you
run
through
the
eldridge
test,
shows
that
there
is
no
denial
of--
mr.
laurence
gold
--no,
i
don't
believe
that
by
hypothesis
some
of
it
is
used
for
non-collective
bargaining
purposes.
each
union
differs
in
the
way
it
approaches
its
task.
this
union,
for
example,
has
a
completely
separate
voluntary
fund
from
which
it
pays
for
all--
mr.
laurence
gold
--political
activities.
mr.
laurence
gold
and
the
union
has
no
organizing
expenses
because
it
has
one
employer
and
that's
the
only
employer
it
deals
with.
mr.
laurence
gold
we
differ
with
the
court
of
appeals
in
validating
this
system,
which
provides
every
protection
that
this
court
in
ellis
said
is
required.
mr.
laurence
gold
it
invalidated
a
system
whereby
the
union
makes
this
initial
calculation
and
certification
and
provides
escrow,
a
union
escrow
system.
it
said
that's
not
good
enough.
mr.
laurence
gold
it
did
indeed,
but--
mr.
laurence
gold
--yes.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
no,
it
said
it
wasn't...
we
don't
believe
that
the
escrow
system
changes
our
conclusion,
it
said.
it
said
the
escrow
system
was
insufficient
because
it
was
under
the
union's
control
and
the
union
created
it.
mr.
laurence
gold
i
answered
justice
stevens
by
saying
that
where
the
union
makes
a
prior
calculation
that
it
is
our
judgment
that
some
cushion
has
to
be
provided
to
take
care
of
the
eventualities
of
what
the
union
is
actually
going
to
do.
mr.
laurence
gold
no.
it
seems
to
us
that
in
ellis
this
court
said
that
there
are
two
different
alternatives.
mr.
laurence
gold
all
we're
saying
is
that
we
approach...
this
union
approached
this
matter
in
a
suspenders
and
belt
style.
it
has
both
a
prior
reduction
and
an
escrow.
mr.
laurence
gold
if
there
were
no
escrow
arrangement
and
all
there
was
was
the
union's
initial
sole
determination
of
the
amount
due
without
any
background
of
prior
experience
or
prior
decisions,
we
wouldn't
challenge
the
court
of
appeals'
determination.
but
this
is
a
first...
i
want
to
emphasize
in
answering
that
this
is
a
first,
what
i
would
call
and
what
the
district
court
called
a
first
year
case,
a
case
where
there
isn't
prior
experience.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
that's
right.
the
governmental
interests
here
are
that
if
you
don't...
and
the
union
interests
the...
that
if
you
don't
get
the
money
month-in,
month-out,
in
the
same
way
you're
getting
it
from
members,
a,
all
the
friction
created
by
the
free
rider
syndrome,
which
is
what
the
government
is
seeking
to
alleviate,
continues
month-in
and
month-out;
and
secondly,
all
the
costs
of
collection
are
increased
enormously,
particularly
if
the
individual
leaves
or
if
you
have
to
sue
to
get
a
big
chunk
of
money
way
after
the
fact.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
i
don't
think
that
anybody
looking
at
this
from
the
union
perspective
is
interested
in
delay.
the
question
is
whether
the
individual
can
say
i
object
and
by
doing
so
set
a
train
in
motion
whereby
he
doesn't
pay
at
all
for
weeks,
months,
or
years.
and
we
say
nothing
in
the
constitution,
no
interest
that
the
individual
has,
can
possibly
justify
that.
