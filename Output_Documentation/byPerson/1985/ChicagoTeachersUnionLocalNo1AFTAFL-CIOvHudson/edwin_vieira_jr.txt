mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
came
here
and
i
remain
somewhat
perplexed
in
attempting
to
determine
for
myself
what
the
utility
is
of
viewing
this
case
as
a
first
amendment
case
that
involves
the
uses
of
fees
that
a
union
is
collecting.
we're
not
dealing
at
this
stage
with
uses,
except
in
an
abstract
definitional
sense
that
they
are
entitled
to
money
only
that
will
be
eventually
used
for
collective
bargaining.
and
no
money
here
has
been
used
because,
as
justice
white
suggested
a
moment
ago,
during
the
course
of
litigation
the
union
introduced
an
escrow
procedure
where
it
segregated
the
moneys
in
a
separate
account.
so
all
of
this
first
amendment
analysis
and
discussion
of
abood
and
such
cases
seemed
to
me
to
be
beside
the
point.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
has--
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
but
i
think
they--
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
they've
needlessly
complicated
this
problem,
and
let
me
explain
why.
i'll
take
a
minute
to
explain
why.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
well,
i
wasn't
responsible
for
writing
the
opinion.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
well,
it
seems
to
me
this
case
would
have
been
approached
simply
by
saying,
money
is
being
taken
for
legitimate
purpose;
is
the
procedure
involved
in
the
taking
constitutional?
what
does
the
seventh
circuit
tell
us?
it
says,
well,
there's
a
liberty
interest
involved
in
the
taking
of
this
money
because
the
money
will
be
used
by
a
union
and
therefore
it
arguably
infringes
freedom
of
association
to
take
it,
but
that
liberty
interest
is
not
unconstitutionally
infringed,
per
abood.
fine.
you
can
deprive
a
person
of
liberty
and
of
property
and
even
of
his
life,
if
you
give
him
due
process
of
law.
that's
the
question:
is
this
money
that
eventually
causes
a
justifiable
infringement
on
freedom
of
association
being
taken
with
due
process
of
law?
and
i
think
the
very
simple
answer...
and
that's
why
i'm
perplexed...
the
very
simple
answer
is
there
is
no
constitutional
procedure
in
this
case.
there's
no
procedure
that
meets
any
standard,
it
seems
to
me,
that
this
court
has
ever
suggested
is
applicable,
except
in
some
extraordinary
emergency
situations,
which
we
do
not
have
here.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
well,
i
think
you
can
do
that
without
ever
getting
into
any--
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
--well,
i
think
you
need
the
neutral
decisionmaker.
you
need
the
governmental
decisionmaker
to
justify
the
taking.
it's
the
government
that's
taking
his
money.
it's
the
board
of
education
that's
deducting
these
fees
from
the
salaries
of
the
employees
simply
on
the
say-so
of
the
union.
and
i
think
before
that
step
is
taken,
some
decisionmaker
has
to
have
some
type
of
factual
presentation
at
least
at
the
level
of
probable
cause,
at
least
at
the
level
of
rationality,
to
suggest
that
this
figure
that's
being
given
has
some
connection
with
the
reality
of
the
collective
bargaining
activities
of
the
union.
now,
in
the
first
year,
i
agree
with
mr.
gold,
it's
a
more
difficult
problem
because
we
don't
know
precisely
what
the
union
is
doing.
in
fact,
in
this
case
we
don't
know
anything
about
what
the
union
is
doing.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
well,
the
first
amendment
comes
into
this,
justice
o'connor,
if
we
look
at
the
use.
that
is,
we
obviously
want
to
prevent
the
union
from
getting
control
of
the
money
to
expend
that
money
until
we
determine
that
that
money
will
be
spent
only
on
first
amendment
allowed
activity.
we
never
want
the
union
to
obtain
control
of
any
money--
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
--but
what
i'm
saying
is
i
don't
think
that
that
question
would
be
relevant
to
the
taking
issue.
that
is,
if
this
money
were
being
taken
to
pay
some
other
debt
that
these
people
owed
the
union,
not
a
payment
that
implicated
associational
interests,
we'd
still
be
worried
about
the
collection
procedure.
we're
going
to
be
worried
about
this
collection
procedure
in
any
kind
of
a
creditor-debtor
framework.
there's
a
secondary
problem
that
not
only
are
we
worried
about
the
initial
taking,
but
we're
also
worried
about
the
transfer
to
the
union.
now,
what
i'm
saying
in
this
case
is
the
union
has
precluded
any
difficulty
with
the
use
question
through
an
escrow,
and
i
think
a
procedure...
and
now
we're
talking
about
a
procedure
that
the
state
will
have
to
devise.
i
don't
think
it's
for
this
court
to
tell
us
what
that
procedure
should
be
in
every
permutation
and
combination.
it's
for
the
state
also
to
devise
a
procedure
whereby
the
union
does
not
obtain
possession,
is
not
allowed
to
use
that
money,
until
there's
a
final
determination
that
precludes
first
amendment
violations.
but
what
i'm
getting
at
here
is,
at
this
stage
of
the
case
we
have
a
procedural
due
process
problem
pure
and
simple
because
the
taking
is
effective
without
any
submission
to
any
governmental
agency
of
a
rational
basis
that
the
figure
the
union
gives
has
some
connection
with
its
real
collective
bargaining
costs.
what
they
do
is
they
take
the
union
dues,
an
arbitrary
figure,
no
necessary
connection
with
the
collective
bargaining
there,
they
subtract
what
they
admit
they're
not
entitled
to
have,
and
they
say:
aha,
the
answer
is
collective
bargaining
costs.
that's
not
rational
on
its
face.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
i
think
there
has
to
be
some
pre-taking
process.
now,
we
use
the
word
"hearing".
that
word
is
used
in
the
brief,
but
i
think
it's
used
in
an
extensive
sense.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
no,
in
theory
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
mean,
look
at
a
case--
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
--oh,
i
don't
think
these
employees
can
be
required
to
exhaust
any
internal
union
procedures
whatsoever.
i
don't
think
the
union
procedures
have
anything
to
do
with
this
case.
the
union
is
coming
to
the
government
saying:
take
these
people's
property,
we
have
a
claim
of
right
to
it;
we're
not
going
to
tell
you
the
factual
basis
for
that
claim;
we're
going
to
give
you
some
non-rational
facts
over
here
that
have
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
final
figure.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
in
this
case
that
it's
the
burden
on
the
employee
to
have
to
initiate
a
court
suit.
i
think
that
the
procedure
that
should
be
followed
in
broad
outline
is
that
the
union
should
be
required
to
come
to
some
agency
of
the
state...
not
saying
it's
a
court;
it
could
be
an
administrative
agency,
a
labor
board,
what
have
you;
we
just
don't
have
a
procedure
down
there
in
illinois...
come
to
some
agency
of
the
state
with
some
certifiable
facts
as
to
what
the
collective
bargaining
costs
are.
at
that
stage,
if
that
agency
determines
as
a
factual
matter
that
there's
a
need
for
these
collections
prior
to
a
final
judicial
determination,
prior
to
the
exhaustion
of
all
of
the
legal
remedies,
fine.
we
don't
have
any
determination
of
that
at
this
stage.
we
don't
have
any
submission
of
any
rational--
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
--that's
right.
but
i
think
that
that
could
be
done
relatively
quickly.
certainly
in
later
years
it
could
be,
after
that
agency
had
had
some
experience
dealing
with
this
particular
union
or
other
particular
unions
as
to
what
their
cost
structure
was,
their
organizational
structure
was.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know
particularly
what
the
personal
preference
of
my
clients
are,
but
they're
required
to
pay
these
dues
under
abood
to
the
extent
that
the
dues
meet
collective
bargaining
costs.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
who
should
have
to
go,
your
honor?
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
oh,
no,
no.
the
union
should
have
to
come
to
some
governmental
agent.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
in
order
to
begin
this
collection
process.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
in
order
to
begin
this
collection
process,
yes,
they
should
have
to--
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
--to
collect
the
fee
to
which
they're
entitled
under
this
statute.
they
don't
have
to
go
to
an
agency
to
collect
dues
from
their
own
members.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
no,
not
from
their
own
members,
only
from
their
non-members.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
because
i
think
that
brings
you
into
justice
o'connor's
problem.
i
don't
think
the
legislature
can
preclude
discussion
of
the
first
amendment
question.
i
don't
think
a
legislature
can
determine--
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
--who's
the
"they",
your
honor?
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
sure
what
the
statute
is
that
you're
proposing.
the
legislature
passes
a
statute--
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
--the
statute
says
that
the
employer
and
the
union
can
agree
to
an
agency
fee,
the
outer
limit
of
which
will
be
the
dues.
it
doesn't
say
that
the
dues
will
be--
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
--no,
i
think
it
represents
a
legislative
finding
that
it
would
be
rather
ridiculous
for
the
union
to
claim
that
it
was
spending
more
money
on
non-members
than
it
was
spending
on
members,
in
the
extreme
case.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
100
percent
of
the
dues?
not
mostly,
100
percent
of
the
dues?
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
every
union,
every
year?
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
well,
i'd
say
that
would
be
non-rational.
i'd
say
you
have
a
big
first
amendment
problem
there.
that
kind
of
a
statute
couldn't
possibly
stand
up.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
well,
it
could,
and
i
think
that
that
statute
would
still
be
subject
to
judicial
challenge
on
the
facts.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
well,
in
the
particular
year,
for
instance.
it
could
be
in
a
particular
year
they
didn't
spend
90
percent.
now,
if
you
put
that
scenario
into
a
procedural
context,
i
can
imagine
a
situation
where,
after
three
or
four
years,
whatever
this
agency
is
that
makes
the
initial
determination
had
seen
these
figures...
89
percent,
90
percent,
91
percent,
coming
every
year...
there
would
be
really
no
problem
in
it
more
or
less
mechanically
allowing
these
collections
of
say
88
percent
after
some
experience
has
been
developed.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know
how
a
legislature
can
make
a
judgment
about
the
future.
are
you
going
to
hold
a
legislative
hearing
every
hearing
every
year
to
determine
what
the
union
does?
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
all
right.
well,
i'm
willing
to
live
with
the
presumption
concept.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
and
put
it
where,
in
escrow?
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
all
right.
well,
when
we
see
that
kind
of
a
statute
passed
we
can
discuss
it.
but
that's
not
what
we
have
here.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
no,
no.
i
was
saying
if
we
had
that
type
of
a
statute
we
would
have
a
first
amendment
problem
if
they
let
the
union
have
that
money.
there's
no
question
about
that.
i
don't
think
that
the
legislature
can
foreclose
the
challenge
to
how
the
union
is
spending
the
money.
you're
now
posing
the
question,
if
the
legislature
says
x
percent
of
a
union's
dues
is
presumptively
going
to
be
the
collective
bargaining
cost,
subject
to
being
held
and
to
being
challenged
on
the
facts
of
a
particular
year,
would
that
escrow
be
legitimate?
well,
i
think
if
you
have
a
legislative
determination
based
on
their
finding
of
a
necessity
for
that
kind
of
a
procedure,
that
is
the
taking
of
the
money,
it
might
very
well
be.
the
problem
i
have
with
it
is
that
if
you
look
at
cases
that
this
court
has
decided
in
the
procedural
area,
there
tends
to
be
a
great
deal
more
factual
basis
for
the
necessity
of
getting
the
taking
into
operation
than
we
have
in
this
case.
what
are
we
talking
about
here?
we're
talking
about
160-something
dollars
a
year.
i
cannot
see
that
the
union
is
going
to
suffer
some
great
financial
detriment
by
these
moneys
being
deferred
to
some
time
in
the
future
because
they're
not
collected.
in
this
particular
case,
the
moneys
are
collected
and
put
in
escrow.
the
union
never
seems
them
until
when,
five
years
from
now,
ten
years
from
now.
how
long
do
you
think
the
judiciary
is
going
to
deal
with
this
question
in
the
state
of
illinois
before
those
escrowed
moneys
finally
come
into
the
possession
of
the
union?
besides,
from
the
union's
point
of
view,
if
they
have
such
a
good
case,
if
these
fees
that
they
are
charging
actually
represent
their
costs,
they
should
have
no
problem
borrowing
this
small
amount
of
money
and
then
charging
the
interest
on
that
to
the
agency
fee-payers
as
a
legitimate
cost
of
collective
bargaining.
i
just
see
no
problem
on
their
side.
now,
the
employee's
problem
is
always
the
same:
are
they
entitled,
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
to
the
interim
possession
and
use
of
their
own
wages,
absent
some
very
strong
governmental
interest
in
taking
that
money
out
of
their
possession
and
putting
it
in
a
segregated
account?
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
oh,
even
they
question
that,
your
honor.
there's
a
footnote
in
their
brief
where
they
admit
that
as
a
matter
of
state
law
and
federal
constitutional
law
the
parameters
of
these
collective
bargaining
charges
are
all
up
in
the
air.
we're
talking
about
years
and
years
of
litigation
when
we
go
to
that
question,
as
to
what's
a
legitimate
collective
bargaining
cost
under
the
illinois
statute,
what's
a
legitimate
collective
bargaining
cost
under
the
federal
constitution.
i
don't
believe
for
one
instant
that
the
majority
of
these
moneys
are
going
to
end
up
in
the
union's
possession.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
okay.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
okay.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
well,
in
this
particular
case
the
burden
on
the
individual--
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
--your
honor,
in
this
particular
case
the
burden
on
the
employee
to
determine
for
himself
whether
or
not
these
fees
are
accurate
is
wholly
disproportionate
to
the
amount
of
money.
the
union
is
saying,
we're
going
to
take
$164
from
you
and
if
you
want
to
challenge
this
bring
a
court
suit.
how
much
do
you
think
it's
going
to
cost
to
bring
a
court
suit
to
determine
the
validity
of
these
fees,
when
the
union
has
all
of
the
evidence,
has
presented
none
of
the
evidence,
when
it's
all
a
matter
of
statutory
interpretation,
constitutional
interpretation?
how
many
people
are
going
to
bring
a
court
suit
in
the
illinois
courts
to
contest
$164?
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
the
money
having
been
collected
before
the
determination
was
made?
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
your
honor,
at
this
stage
i'm
not
interested
in
litigating.
all
i'm
saying
is,
before
they're
allowed
to
take
the
money
they
have
to
present
to
someone
some
rational
facts.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
assuming
that
the
legislature
makes
that
finding,
based
on
its
determination
of
the
need
for
this
collection
and
escrowing
of
the
moneys,
i
guess
we'd
have
to
live
with
it.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
we
have
the
great
difficulty
here
that,
as
the
union
itself
admits--
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
--well,
let's
not
say
witnesses.
the
problem
i
have
with
justice
stevens'
suggestion
is,
until
the
statutory
and
constitutional
questions
of
the
definition
of
collective
bargaining
services
have
been
settled
at
least
in
large
part,
what
is
this
auditor
going
to
do?
is
he
going
to
make
legal
determinations?
is
he
going
to
look
at
a
list
of
union
activities
and
say,
yes,
this
one
is
inside
of
abood,
no,
that
one's
outside
of
abood?
and
then
what's
the
value
of
that
type
of
determination?
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
and
that
figure
they
bring
to
the
board.
well
now,
that's
getting
to
what
i
was
suggesting.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
i
think--
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
--well
now,
wait
a
minute.
that's
after
the
collections,
the
determination
after
the
collections
of
the
validity
of
the
uses
of
the
money.
i'm
talking
about
the
pre-collection.
if
the
union
came
to
the
board
and
said,
we
had
our
own--
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
--excuse
me?
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
when
the
union
comes--
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
--well,
it's
not
directed
towards
this
question.
i
think
when
the
union
comes
to
the
state
agency,
the
board,
let's
say,
and
what
it
has
as
the
evidence
for
its
fee
request
is
some
sort
of
determination
made
by
an
independent
accounting
firm
or
arbitrator
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
this,
now,
that's
some
probative
evidence.
whether
it
rises
to
the
level
of
what
i
would
call
probable
cause
is
another
question,
and
you
have
to
look
at
the
evidence.
but
that
isn't
what
happened
here.
the
independent
determination,
the
basis
for
this
claim,
was
not
made
before
the
taking.
it
was
made
after
the
taking,
or
to
be
made
after
the
taking,
because
actually
no
one
went
through
that
internal
union
procedure.
i'm
not
saying
that
the
union
can't
generate
these
figures
initially.
i'm
saying
that
it
should
generate
the
figures
initially.
it
should
be
required
to
take
it
to
some
responsible
official
in
the
state
and
justify
this
with
some
minimal
level
of
factual
and
legal
basis,
and
then
that
agency
can
say,
all
right,
now
we're
going
to
collect
this
money,
and
maybe
then
it
can
be
put
into
escrow,
so
we
don't
have
the
problem
justice
o'connor
discussed
of
impermissible
uses.
but
first
let's
have
some
rational
basis
for
this
thing.
we
have
no
procedure
now.
we
have
a
union
coming
to
a
government
official
and
saying,
we
want
those
people's
property
and
we're
really
not
going
to
tell
you
why,
because
as
they
say
and
admit
at
every
level
in
this
litigation,
they
calculate
the
fee
by
subtracting
an
arbitrary
number
from
an
arbitrary
number.
and
if
that
doesn't
come
up
with
an
arbitrary
number,
i'm
not
too
good
at
arithmetic.
they
simply
have
not
documented
the
actual
services
they've
performed
or
the
costs
of
those
services.
now,
i
don't
think
that's
a
great
deal
of
documentation,
really.
if
they've
done
these
things,
they
have
a
record
of
it.
if
they
plan
to
do
them,
they
have
a
proposed
budget.
and
i
don't
see
why
they
can't
do
the
same
thing
that's
been
required
in
sniadach,
fuentes,
north
georgia
finishing,
mitchell
versus
w.t.
grant...
some
kind
of
factual
evidence
presented
to
a
neutral
government
official.
i
don't
think
it
has
to
be
a
judicial,
full-blown
judicial
evidentiary
hearing.
it
probably
doesn't
even
have
to
be
a
full-blown
administrative
evidentiary
hearing.
but
it
has
to
be
something
more
than
nothing.
it
has
to
be
something
more
than
a
naked
demand
for
the
money,
backed
up
by
a
bluff,
because
that's
what
we
have
here.
it
has
to
be
a
rational
calculation
on
paper.
look
at
it
and
see
that
it's
rational,
that
you
could
get
from
a
through
b
to
c.
and
we
have
no
check
in
this
present
case
against
erroneous
determinations
whatsoever.
the
check
comes
after
the
fact,
either
before
the
union's
internal
arbitrator
or
in
some
protracted
judicial
proceedings.
heaven
knows
how
long
they'll
take
and
how
complicated
and
how
expensive.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
but
it's
not
necessarily
collective
bargaining
they're
paying
for,
your
honor.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
i
have
no
idea
what
the
principal
function
this
union
performs.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
well,
for
instance,
your
honor--
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
--sure.
if
we
want
to
speculate,
because
none
of
this
is
in
the
record,
some
of
this
money,
a
significant
amount
of
this
money
goes
to
the
national
level
of
this
union,
the
american
federation
of
teachers.
i'm
pretty
sure
the
american
federation
of
teachers
doesn't
do
much
collective
bargaining
in
chicago.
i
think
they
have
national
concerns,
maybe
even
international
concerns.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
yes,
it
is,
but
it
escapes
me
now.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
a
little
more
than
one-third,
i
believe.
mr.
gold
might
have
that
figure.
it's
a
sizable
amount
of
money.
and
again,
i
don't
think
the
amount
of
money...
well,
let's
look
at
the
carey
case.
what
did
you
say
in
the
carey
case?
there's
an
absolute
right
to
procedural
due
process.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
you
win
or
lose,
ultimately.
you
have
absolute
right
to
procedural
due
process.
that's
all
we're
asking
for
here.
before
they
take
the
money,
at
some
stage
the
government
receives
some
factual
basis
for
saying
the
figure
is
reasonable.
afterwards,
there
can
be
an
argument
about
exactly
how
much.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
abstractly
it
could
be,
your
honor.
but
i
really
don't
like
that
idea.
they
don't
have
any
expertise
in
these
matters.
you're
putting
a
burden
on
those
people
that
they're
really
not
capable
of
meeting.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
that's
right.
i
think
if
you
put
it
that
way,
if
you
look
at
the
activities
of
the
union
that
are
done
in
conjunction
with
the
school
board,
there
you
would
have
a
case
in
which
the
government
official
who
was
reviewing
the
request
actually
had
its
own
independent
knowledge
of
the
facts.
and
that
might
be
workable
with
respect
to
the
activities
of
the
union
in
the
local.
i'm
not
so
sure
of
the
extent
that
that
would
be
workable
with
respect
to
the
activities
that
the
union
conducts
at
the
state
and
national
level
that
the
local
charges
for.
that's
the
only
reason
i
have
a
problem
with
it.
there
are
some
levels
of
activity
of
the
union
in
which
there
is
no
interaction
with
the
board.
if
we
were
talking
about
a
local
union
only
or
the
local
proportion
of
the
dues,
which
i
imagine
is
the
largest
proportion
of
the
chicago
teachers
union
section
of
this
in
any
event,
it
might
very
well
be
possible
for
the
state
to
work
out
a
system.
but
we
don't
have
the
state.
and
to
be
honest
with
you,
your
honors,
i'm
not
asking
you
to
give
us
a
system.
it's
the
state
of
illinois'
problem.
the
only
thing
i'm
asking
for
here
is
first
a
determination
that
there
has
to
be
some
injection
of
fact
and
review
by
a
government
official
before
the
taking,
and
secondly--
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
--yes,
i
think
that
they
sent
this
thing
back,
they
threw
it
in
the
lap
of
the
board
and
they
said:
you
work
out
a
procedure,
you
work
out
a
procedure.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
well,
they
left
it
rather
open.
in
fact,
i
think
that
they
may
have
been
telling
the
board,
too,
that
they
had
to
make
almost
a
final
determination
of
the
figure.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
well,
i
think
it's
a
lesser
included.
i'm
not
going
to
require
the
board
to
make
the
final
determinations
on
the
size
of
the
fee.
i'm
saying
that
the
agency
that
does
the
checking
off,
the
agency
that
does
the
deducting,
has
to
have
something
before
it
beyond
just
a
naked
demand.
after
that,
if
you
go
into
an
administrative
agency,
which
i
think
is
the
way
these
things
will
end
up,
the
state
of
illinois
will
fashion
some
sort
of
an
administrative
procedure
for
handling
this.
and
probably
that's
the
way
it
will
end
up
ultimately,
that
the
union
will
have
to
come
to
that
agency,
present
its
facts,
the
agency
will
certify
it,
and
the
checkoffs
will
be
made.
but
they'll
have
the
facts
on
the
record,
and
if
there's
some
gross
problem
with
the
facts
presented
by
the
union
then
the
dissenting
employee
can
put
his
challenge
on
the
record
with
the
agency
at
that
point,
right
at
the
beginning.
otherwise,
this
thing
will
go
along
rather
mechanically,
any
challenges
to
be
brought
up
later
on.
our
problem
here
is
that
we're
at
the
initial
step
in
the
whole
procedure.
we
have
no
rational
involvement
by
the
state
other
than
the
seizure
of
the
money.
