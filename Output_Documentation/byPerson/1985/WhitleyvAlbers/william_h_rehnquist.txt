justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
frohnmayer,
is
there
an
element
of
kind
of
command
decision
in
your
reasoning
that
this
is
a
little
bit
like
war,
at
least,
and
that
perhaps
the
prison
officials
may
be
entitled
to
sacrifice
or
injure
one
prisoner
if
it
means
that
several
hostages
will
thereby
be
released?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
was
a
fourth
amendment
case,
wasn't
it,
mr.
mechanic?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
line
of
cases
from
this
court
do
you
rely
on
for
your
due
process
as
opposed
to
your
fourth
amendment
contention?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that
was
the
paddling
at
school?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
judge
panner,
when
he,
in
his
opinion,
in
granting
the
motion
for
a
directed
verdict,
said
here
the
uncontradicted
evidence
is
that
defendants
were
faced
with
a
riot
situation.
you
disagree
with
him
on
that,
i
suppose,
as
well
as
with
the
attorney
general?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
would
judge
each
riot
on
its
own
facts
then?
