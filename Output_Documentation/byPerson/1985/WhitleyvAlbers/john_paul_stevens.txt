justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
attorney
general,
could
i
interrupt
because
one
point
i
want
to
be
sure
i
have
clearly
in
mind.
this
is
a
summary
judgment
case
in
which,
as
i
understand
it,
we
must
assume
all
the
facts
favorable
to
your
adversary
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
in
the
ninth
circuit
opinion,
as
i
recall
it,
they
made
a
point
that
if
one
views
the
evidence
most
favorably
to
the
other
side,
one
might
conclude
that
the
height...
that
the
crisis
had
pretty
much
passed,
that
the
conditions
had
subsided
to
a
certain
extent,
and
so
that
the
emergency
justification,
which
seems
quite
persuasive,
as
you
present
it,
wasn't
as
strong
as
it
was
in
hour
or
two
before--
to
what...
i
think
you
perhaps
may
want
to
comment
on
that.
is
the
record
subject
to
a
different
view
as
to
the
degree
of
emergency
that
existed
at
the
time
that
the
action
was...
took
place?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
clear
that...
was
this
fellow
klenk
the
one
who
was
holding...
i
had
the
impression
there
were
two
other
inmates
who
in
effect
said
we
will
protect
this
man.
i
don't
know
if
that
was
known
to
the
men
who
broke
in
or
not,
but
there
is
a
little
uncertainty
in
my
own
mind
about
exactly
what
the
jury
might
conclude
on
that
fact.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
it
also
true
that
during
this
period
some
other
guard
or
some
other
was
allowed
to
go
in
and
talk
to
the
hostage
and
go
out
and
report
that
he
was,
seemed
to
be
okay
or
something
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question,
general
frohnmayer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
relied
on
an
expert
that
the
ninth
circuit
referred
to,
and
i
guess
his
testimony
doesn't
go
far
enough
in
your
view
to,
even
if
you
believe
it
all
and
disbelieve
your
experts,
to
satisfy
your
test,
but
supposing...
we
are
concerned
with
the
problem
can
you
always
get
a
jury
trial
in
a
case
of
this
kind.
supposing
in
a
case
like
this
the
jury
can
always
get
some...
i
mean
the
plaintiff
can
always
find
some
expert
who
would
be
willing
to
get
up
on
the
witness
stand
and
say
in
my
professional
opinion
this
was,
a,
wanton;
it
was
unnecessary,
whatever
the
three
parts
of
the
test
are.
if
you
just
had
nothing
but
an
expert
testimony
and
then
some
kind
of
ambiguous
fact,
would
that
always
get
you
to
the
jury,
if
you
again
have
an
expert
witness
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
mechanic--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
interrupt
with...
is
it
not
correct
that
a
couple
of
hours
or
maybe
an
hour
and
a
half
before
the
shooting
that
there
had
been
a
cell-in
order,
and
that
at
the
time
of
the
violence,
there
were
still
a
lot
of
inmates
who
had
not
returned
to
their
cells?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
many?
does
the
record
tell
us?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
to
the
extent
that
there
were
inmates
that
had
not
returned
to
their
cells,
now,
whether
the
word
"riot"
fits
or
not,
they
at
least
were
in
disobedience
of
an
outstanding
cell-in
order.
