mr.
attorney
general,
i
hate
to
interrupt
you,
but
the
eighth
amendment
is
the
only
one
involved
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
one
was...
but
at
least
one
was
armed.
justice
thurgood
marshall
at
least
one
prisoner
had
a
knife.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
they
weren't
that
innocent.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
only,
it
only
takes
one
knife
to
kill
one
person.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think--
--it's
according
to
where
you're
holding
that
bomb.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you're
holding
that
bomb
on
my
head,
it's
a
riot.
now--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--in
this
case,
they
knew
at
least
one
of
them
was
armed
with
a
knife.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
didn't
know
whether
the
others
had
knives
or
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
did
they
know
he
was
unarmed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
can
you
add
a
presumption
when
you
find
one
that
was
armed?
isn't
that
the
end
of
the
presumption?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
have
the
presumption
that
they're
not
armed
and
you
find
one
is
armed,
isn't
that
the
end
of
that
presumption?
