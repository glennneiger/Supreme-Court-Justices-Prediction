mr.
frohnmayer,
do
you
think
the
due
process
clause
imposes
some
separate
obligation
applicable
to
the
use
of
excessive
force
in
this
situation?
would
that
be
another
way
to
analyze
the
problem?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
the
standard
should
be
the
same
if
looked
at
under
the
due
process
clause
for
use
of
excessive
force
as
for
eighth
amendment
purposes?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
is
that
for
a
single
incident
that
seems
to
have
very
little
to
do
with
conditions
of
imprisonment
or
with
any
aspect
of
punishment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
is
more
or
less
a
single
incident
in
the
process
of
putting
down
a
prison
riot,
isn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
mechanic,
are
you
concerned
only
with
the
decision
and
order
that
a
prisoner
who
followed
mr.
whitley
up
the
stairs
would
be
shot?
is
that
the
focus
you
want
us
to
have
on
that
decision?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
are
not
concerned,
then,
with
the
fact
that
an
assault
team
was
going
to
be
sent
into
the
cellblock.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
decision
to
shoot
anyone
who
followed
whitley
up
the
stairs.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
do
you
take
the
position
that
a
decision
in
these
circumstances
to
shoot
anyone
who
followed
him
up
the
stairs
was
unprofessional?
is
that
your
point,
or
what?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
take
the
position
then
that
to
impose
liability
here,
the
decision
had
to
be
wanton
or
reckless?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
really
think
that
the
ninth
circuit
spoke
in
terms
of
wanton
or
reckless
behavior
as
opposed
to
what
was
reasonable
in
the
circumstances?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
just...
there's
language
in
the
opinion
that
the
court
of
appeals
applied
a
standard
of
whether
the
officer
knew
or
should
have
known
that
force
was
unnecessary.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
was
an
alternative,
i
thought.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
any
event,
you
do
not
stand
here
to
support
a
standard
of
simply
asking
whether
the
officer
knew
or
should
have
known
that
the
force
was
unnecessary.
