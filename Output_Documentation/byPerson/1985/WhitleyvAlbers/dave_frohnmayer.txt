mr.
dave
frohnmayer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
before
this
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
during
a
1980
prison
riot
in
oregon,
officials
formed
a
plan
to
restore
order
and
to
rescue
a
hostage
whose
life
had
been
threatened
by
a
knife-wielding
inmate.
an
unarmed
prison
official
vaulted
over
an
inmate-constructed
barricade
and
raced
up
a
flight
of
stairs
to
the
cell
in
which
the
hostage
was
being
held.
an
inmate,
respondent
albers
here,
ran
up
after
him.
pursuant
to
prior
orders,
and
armed
official
shot,
but
shot
low,
in
order
to
present
respondent
and
a
fellow
inmate
from
getting
up
the
stairs
and
thereby
potentially
impeding
the
rescue
attempt.
in
this
incident,
which
the
record
shows
took
place
from
start
to
finish
in
less
time
than
i
have
now
taken
to
describe
it,
the
hostage
was
successfully
rescued,
but
respondent
albers
suffered
a
serious
and
permanent
injury
to
his
knee.
the
district
court
below
concluded
that
the
evidence
presented
no
basis
from
which
a
jury
could
conclude
that
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishments
clause
of
the
eighth
amendment
had
been
violated.
respondent
and
the
ninth
circuit
have
disagreed,
so
that
this
case
places
squarely
the
issue
as
to
in
the
aftermath
of
this
difficult
decision,
how
far
the
hindsight
of
a
jury
can
intrude
into
prison
security
decisions.
is
it
the
role
of
the
jury
to
sort
through
the
waste
pile
of
discarded
or
unconsidered
hostage
rescue
plans,
decide
that
one
of
them
might
have
been
better,
and
on
that
basis
assess
personal
monetary
liability
against
prison
officials
for
a
constitutional
violation?
we
submit
that
the
ninth
circuit
has
permitted
a
jury
to
do
what
this
court
repeatedly
has
told
judges
themselves
to
refrain
from
doing.
and
this
case
is
of
extraordinary
practical
importance
because
when
they
are
faced
with
an
out
break
of
violence,
prison
officials
must
act.
they
do
not
have
the
luxury
of
after-the-fact
reflection.
the
maintenance
of
security,
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
indicated,
is
the
most
essential
aspect
of
the
maintaining
of
prison
itself.
and
if
officials
do
not
retain
control
or
regain
it,
the
lives
of
staff
and
inmates
alike
are
continually
at
risk,
and
the
officials
have
abdicated
their
essential
official
responsibility.
i
will
argue
this
morning
for
the
validity
of
four
proposition
which
should
control
the
outcome
of
this
case:
first,
that
the
record
shows
no
proof
of
wantonness
or
cruelty
in
this
hostage
rescue
action,
which
is
essential
to
establish
an
eighth
amendment
violation;
secondly,
that
there
was
no
proof
that
albers'
injury
was
inflicted
unnecessarily,
that
is
to
say,
totally
without
penological
justification;
third,
that
the
ninth
circuit's
reasonableness
standard
ignores
the
deference
and
discretion,
the
latitude
for
official
judgment
which
this
court
in
numerous
constitutional
cases
has
repeatedly
said
is
essential
for
the
administration
of
prisons;
and
finally,
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
incorrectly
interpreted
this
court's
standards
of
qualified
immunity
and
it
also
ignored
the
total
absence
of
meaningful
case
law
as
guidance
for
prison
officials
when
it
denied
the
existence
of
immunity
for
the
prison
officials
in
this
case.
let
me
now
recapitulate
the
facts
in
more
detail
because
they
demonstrate
the
justice
of
our
cause.
on
june
27th
in
1980
the
inmates
in
cellblock
a
of
the
oregon
state
prison
became
upset.
they
suspected
that
other
inmates
had
been
mistreated.
they
disobeyed
a
cell-in
order
given
by
prison
officials.
one
of
the
two
guards
on
the
block
was
taken
hostage;
the
other
was
assaulted.
there
was
fighting
among
the
inmates,
destruction
of
the
furniture
in
the
cellblock
was
virtually
complete,
and
despite
a
demonstration
to
a
selected
group
of
the
inmates
that
others
in
fact
had
not
been
abused,
the
inmates
still
retained
control.
richard
klenk
was
a
main
instigator
of
the
riot.
he
was
armed
with
a
knife.
he
reported
that
he
had
already
killed
one
inmate
and
would
kill
others,
and
he
made
it
clear
that
if
there
were
any
attempt
to
retain
control...
regain
control
of
the
cellblock,
that
he
would
cut
the
throat
of
the
hostage
guard.
the
plan
that
was
adopted
called
for
captain
whitley
to
enter
unarmed
at
a
time
when
klenk
was
away
from
the
hostage
cell.
surprise
about
the
timing
and
nature
of
the
assault
obviously
was
a
key
element.
whitley's
objective
was
to
secure
the
safety
and
return
of
the
hostage
officer.
approximately
20
guards
were
lined
up
to
follow
whitley
into
the
cellblock.
the
first
three
of
them
were
armed
with
shotguns
in
order
to
protect
whitley,
and
the
armed
guards
had
been
ordered
to
shoot,
but
shoot
low,
any
inmate
who
went
up
the
stairs
after
whitley.
when
klenk
again
refused
to
free
the
hostage,
whitley
began
the
assault.
whitley
vaulted
the
barricade
as
a
warning
shot
was
fired.
he
pursued
klenk,
who
ran
up
the
stairs
toward
the
hostage.
officer
kennicott
followed
over
the
barricade,
firing
a
second
shot
in
the
direction
of
two
inmates
who
ran
up
the
stairs
ahead
of
whitley.
whitley,
in
pursuit
of
klenk,
ran
past
albers
and
started
up
the
stairs.
albers,
who
had
not
run
up
the
stairs
after
the
warning
shot
or
the
second
shot,
then
turned,
and
along
with
another
inmate
followed
whitley
up
the
stairs.
kennicott,
pursuant
to
his
orders,
shot.
albers
was
injured
in
the
knee,
and
the
other
inmate
was
also
injured.
the
district
court
found
that
on
these
facts
no
jury
could
reasonably
find
liability
under
the
eight
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution,
and
he
also
found
that...
directed
the
verdict
on
the
basis
that
the
defendants
in
this
action
were
immune.
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
and
held
that
there
was
a
jury
question
on
the
existence
of
an
eighth
amendment
violation,
and
it
also
held
that
if
an
eighth
amendment
violation
were
found,
almost
as
a
per
se
rule,
then
a
qualified
immunity
could
not
apply.
before
we
begin
our
argument,
i
think
it
is
appropriate
to
recapitulate
the
constitutional
tests
which
we
believe
that
this
court
has
articulated
governing
an
eighth
amendment
violation
in
a
prison
context.
we
are
mindful
of
this
court's
admonition
that
the
eighth
amendment
analysis
is
not
simply
constituted
of
parsing
dictionary
meanings
of
selected
pieces
of
constitutional--
mr.
dave
frohnmayer
--we
contend
that
it
is,
justice
marshall.
it
was
the
one
that
was
argued
below.
we
have
understood
and
the
district
court
understood
the
due
process
argument
to
have
been
advanced
only
because
the
due
process
clause
was
the
vehicle
of
incorporating
the
eighth
amendment
guarantee
as
against
the
states.
mr.
dave
frohnmayer
justice
o'connor,
we
do
not
believe
that
the...
that
that
adds
anything
to
the
analysis
that
would
flow
otherwise
under
the
eighth
amendment.
mr.
dave
frohnmayer
well,
if
it
is
a
prison
context,
then
i
would
suggest
that
no,
that
the
eighth
amendment
should
be
the
exclusive
vehicle
by
which
that
is
analyzed,
or
at
least
if
the
due
process
clause
is
considered
the
analysis--
mr.
dave
frohnmayer
--well--
mr.
dave
frohnmayer
--it
is
a
single
incident,
but
the
incident
implicates
the
core
of
what
it
is
that
a
prison
is
all
about,
which
is
the
maintenance
of
security
of
people
who
are
very
dangerous
people.
and
so
in
that
sense,
i
believe
that
this
court's
analysis
in
rhodes
v.
chapman
would
consider
it
as
an
eighth
amendment
issue.
under
the
due
process
clause,
however,
if
that
were
the
mode
of
analysis
of
this
court,
we
would
conclude
that
there
should
be
no
difference
in
the
analysis,
that
the
tests
ultimately
would
resolve
themselves
to
the
same
result,
and
that
that
would
be
done
by
virtue
of
analyzing
whether
it
was
wanton,
whether
or
not
it
was
unnecessary
in
the
sense
that
it
lacked
a
penological
purpose,
and
whether
or
not
what
was
done
was
within
the
range
of
professional
discretion.
and
each
of
those
things
has
been
examined
by
this
court
in
the
due
process
context,
we
believe
in
bell
v.
wolfish,
block
and
rutherford,
but
the
eighth
amendment,
focusing
as
it
does
on
punishment
and
conditions
of
confinement,
is
the
mode
of
analysis
in
which
this
case
was
argued
at
the
beginning
and
which
we
believe
is
most
appropriate
for
its
disposition.
mr.
dave
frohnmayer
yes,
it
did,
justice
brennan.
mr.
dave
frohnmayer
i
think
that
the
standard
that
was
applied
took
pieces
of
what
purports
to
be
an
eighth
amendment
test,
but
in
the
application
of
that
test
to
what
actually
happened,
as
revealed
by
the
record,
in
fact
diluted
it
and
watered
it
down.
what
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
did
essentially
was
adopt
a
reasonableness
test,
a
hindsight
reasonableness
test.
mr.
dave
frohnmayer
we
think
that
it
did,
and
we
think
that
that
is,
that
is
the
flaw
of
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
because
it's
one
thing
to
articulate
at
least
the
verbal
formulas
of
the
tests
evolved
by
this
court.
it
is
quite
another
to
apply
them
incorrectly.
and
the
latter
is
the
flaw
of
the
ninth
circuit.
and
as
we
understand
what
it
did,
it
essentially
evolves
into
a
reasonableness
test
because
the
test
of
excessiveness
as
we
look
at
the
ninth
circuit
is
simply
was
there
some
less
forceful
alternative
that
might
have
worked.
if
that
were
the
case,
then
a
jury
question
on
the
reasonableness
of
the
course
of
action
that
was
chosen
is
presented.
we
believe
that
is
not
what
this
court
meant
by
the
deliberate
indifference
test
nor
by
the
other
tests
suggesting
that
the
wanton
infliction
of
pain
or
unnecessary
in
the
sense
that
there
is
no
penological
objective
is
the
appropriate
test.
i
hope
i
have
been
responsive
to
your
question
because
i
think
it
is
the
application
of
the
test
that
constitutes
the
error
made
by
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
dave
frohnmayer
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct
indeed.
we
are
mindful,
of
course,
that
there
is
a
core
set
of
values
of
the
eighth
amendment
that
have
been
variously
described
as
prohibitions
against
cruelty,
barbarism
or
sadistic
torture.
we
are
mindful
also
that
there
is
an
evolutionary
aspect,
whether
one
talks
about
weems,
trop
v.
dulles
or
others
of
the
eighth
amendment
test,
such
that
the...
there
must
be
some
kind
of
social
consensus
about
the
excess
of
the
punishment
that
is
imposed.
but
taking
all
of
this
court's
recent
decisions,
we
believe
that
there
is
a
three
part
test
that
should
govern
cases
of
the
kind
presented
here,
whether
they
are
isolated
outbreaks
of
prison
violence
or
whether
they
go
to
the
question
of
prison
conditions:
first
of
all,
that
the
action
that
is
taken
must
be
wanton
in
the
sense
that
it
is
the
senseless,
irrational
infliction
of
pain.
secondly,
it
must
be
unnecessary
in
the
sense
that
it
serves
no
valid
penological
purpose.
and
third,
it
must
fall
outside
the
range
of
acceptable
professional
discretion
which
this
court
has
granted
to
prison
administrators,
but
which
has
its
limits
also.
our
first
proposition
obviously
is
that
there
is
no
proof
in
this
record
that
a
jury
would
have
considered
that
there
was
wanton
infliction
of
pain.
this
court
has
used
adjectives
such
as
gross
or
extreme
or
harsh
or
gratuitous,
all
of
which
stem
from
the
historic
roots
in
application
of
the
eighth
amendment
guarantee,
even
going
back
to
the
petition
of
wright.
the
ninth
circuit,
we
believe,
as
my
colloquy
with
justice
powell
i
hope
has
demonstrated,
that
the
ninth
circuit
has
distorted
this
to
say
that
if
a
lesser
level
of
force
might
have
sufficed,
then
the
case
must
go
to
the
jury.
for
albers,
on
the
other
hand,
apparently
any
evidence
of
unreasonableness
will
do.
this
is
really
importing
a
tort-like
cast
into
the
eighth
amendment's
jurisprudence,
and
whatever
else
it
may
do,
we
believe
that
the
eighth
amendment
does
not
import
the
restatement
of
torts
into
constitutional
litigation,
because
under
either
test
which
has
been
advanced
or
mixtures
of
the
test
which
have
been
advanced,
any
evidence
of
a
possibly
less
forceful
alternative
would
present
a
jury
question,
and
therefore,
virtually
any
time
an
inmate
is
injured
by
the
use
of
force
in
the
quelling
of
a
prison
riot,
there
would
be
a
jury
question
under
the
eighth
amendment.
this
we
believe
cannot
be
correct.
our
second
proposition
is
that
albers'
injury
was
not
inflicted
unnecessarily,
that
is
to
say
wholly
without
penological
justification.
if
there
is
one
central
purpose
for
prisons,
it
is
the
maintenance
of
security,
and
it
takes
only
the
learning
of
hudson
v.
palmer
from
which
that
is
virtually
a
direct
quote
in
order
to
establish
that
proposition.
it
was
objectively
clear
from
the
circumstances,
however
favorably
the
record
is
read
in
favor
of
respondent
albers,
that
any
inmate
who
went
up
the
stairs
after
an
unarmed
guard
who
was
attempting
to
rescue
a
hostage
presented
an
objective
threat
to
the
success
of
the
rescue
operation,
and
if
that
is
the
case,
then
the
plan
had
to
account
for
that.
the
subjective
expectations
of
respondent
albers
are
in
that
sense
constitutionally
irrelevant
to
the
fact
of
the
plan
that
had
been
formulated.
and
let
us
bear
in
mind
that
if
too
little
force
had
been
used,
again
with
our
virtues
of
hindsight,
and
if
albers
had
been
of
another
mindset
or
if
in
fact
he
had
ascended
the
top
of
the
stairs,
there
might
well
have
been
two
hostages
or
two
dead
hostages
or
weapons
in
the
control
of
those
who--
mr.
dave
frohnmayer
--they
should
consider
those
alternatives,
justice
rehnquist,
but
there
is
an
element
of
choice
of
evils
about
it.
in
every
war,
even
one
side's
own
enemies
are
injured
by
friendly
fire.
in
a
situation
where
there
is
a
crisis,
there
is
an
emergency,
and
where
every
alternative
is
full
of
risk
and
danger,
where
there
are
no
risk-free
alternatives,
it
is
possible
that
that
result
could
occur.
emergencies
come
closer
to
war
decisions.
now,
that
doesn't
mean
that
one
engages
in
illegal
warfare
because
we
do
believe
that
in
this
court's
admonishment
that
professional
judgment
be
used,
and
in
the
very
reason
that
you
give
deference
and
tell
lower
courts
to
give
deference
to
prison
administrators,
we
expect
them
to
act
as
professionals,
and
that's
what
happened
here.
we
are
not
asking
for
a
promiscuous
delegation
of
authority
to
engage
in
mindless
violence
against
persons
who
are
helpless
because
they
are
incarcerated.
the
facts
of
this
record
bespeak
the
rationality
and
justice
of
what
was
done.
mr.
dave
frohnmayer
a
directed
verdict
case
in
the
same
standard,
yes.
mr.
dave
frohnmayer
it
is
susceptible
to
that
as
a
conclusion
but
not
as
a
fact.
justice
stevens,
even
taking
the
record
in
the
most
favorable
light
to
respondent,
he's
entitled
to
a
favorable
gloss
on
the
fact
but
not
to
ignore
the
facts,
and
the
facts
that
remain,
there
was
still
a
hostage,
there
was
still
a
threat
to
that
hostage's
life.
the
person
holding
the
hostage
had
threatened
to
kill
others,
and
he
was
armed
and
had
been
observed
to
have
been
armed.
mr.
dave
frohnmayer
yes,
justice
stevens,
the
hostage
officer,
officer
fitts,
was
being
held
in
cell
201.
there
is
obviously
no
lock
on
the
door
of
cell
201.
the
testimony
did
show
that
those
two
inmates
who
said
that
they
would
help
protect
officer
fitts
also
said
that
they
were
not
sure
they
could
guarantee
his
safety.
mr.
dave
frohnmayer
klenk
was
armed
with
a
knife.
that
is
undisputed.
the
inmates
were
still
in
control
of
cellblock
a.
that's
undisputed.
they
had
all
violated
the
cell-in
order.
and
there
is
still
pregnant
in
this
situation
the
potential
for
violence
any
time
order
and
controls
are
not
restored.
mr.
dave
frohnmayer
yes.
in
fact,
it
was
captain
whitley,
the
very
person
who
led
the
assault
over
the
barricade,
a
minimum
of
three
times
went
in
to
assess
the
facts,
to
determine
what
the
realities
and
the
dangers
were.
he
led
that
assault.
it
was
his
plan
that
was
carried
out.
but
at
this
point
obviously
he
was
not
doing
what
he
did
on
the
basis
of
rumor
and
innuendo
and
hearsay;
he
had
personally
assessed
the
situation
as
an
expert
who
had
to
deal
with
that
situation.
so
even
given
the
most
favorable
gloss,
even
assuming
that
there
had
been
a
subsiding
of
the
violence,
cellblock
a
was
in
the
control
of
the
inmates;
a
person
was
threatened
to
be
killed;
a
hostage
was
there,
and
the
ever-present
danger
of
an
uncontrolled
outbreak
of
violence
which
could
have
resulted
in
injury
to
inmates
or
guards
alike
was
always
present,
and
i
think
even
given
the
most
favorable
assumptions
to
respondent,
almost
on
its
face
has
to
be
seen
in
a
situation
of
extreme
danger.
the
plan
in
fact
was
carried
out
as
was
intended.
these
officials
were
experts.
they
did
assess
the
risks
and
facts.
this
was
not
mindless
violence
perpetrated
against
prisoners
irrespective
of
their
involvement
as
aspects
who
created
danger,
and
even
every
expert
who
testified,
even
those
experts
who
testified
on
behalf
of
respondent,
all
of
them
acknowledged
that
life
threatening
alternatives
might
equally
have
been
used.
one
of
the
alternatives
suggested
by
one
of
plaintiff's
experts
was
to
assassinate
klenk
with
a
sniper
rifle.
another
expert
suggested
that
riot
batons
be
used,
acknowledging
in
his
examination
that
those
riot
batons
could
cause
deadly
injury.
we
submit
that
albers
and
the
ninth
circuit
have
invited
juries
to
substitute
their
judgment
in
hindsight
on
the
basis
of
what
might
have
been
most
reasonable
or
more
reasonable.
we
submit
that
that
is
not
the
eighth
amendment
test.
the
test
is
whether
the
plan
that
was
chosen
violates
the
eighth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution.
and
on
all
evidence,
even
most
favorably
considered
for
requirement,
it
does
not.
this
court...
and
this
is
our
third
proposition...
has
repeatedly
declared
that
broad
latitude
is
necessary
for
the
effective
administration
of
prisons
for
reasons,
policies
and
the
separation
of
powers,
considerations
which
are
too
lengthy
to
mention.
we
note
that
we
are
not
asking
for
the
promiscuous
delegation
of
discretion
to
wreak
violence
on
people,
but
the
latitude,
the
deference
that
has
been
acknowledged,
whether
in
procunier
v.
martinez,
bell
v.
wolfish,
rhodes
v.
chapman,
block
v.
rutherford,
is
all
directed
toward
an
acknowledgement
that
the
central
core
responsibility
of
prisons
is
to
maintain
security.
when
that
security
breaks
down
there
will
always
be
suggestions
of
some
other
alternative
that
might
have
been
used,
and
there
will
never,
never
be
a
riskfree
alternative
on
the
technology
that
we
have.
mr.
dave
frohnmayer
yes.
mr.
dave
frohnmayer
no.
i
am
aware
of
the
consideration
that
you
mention,
and
we
think
not.
the
trial
judge
is
still
the
gatekeeper,
and
we
suggest
that
it
is
not
the
function
of
the
jury
to
arbitrate
simple
professional
disagreements,
and
i
believe
the
court
has
confronted
this
issue
in
another
context,
in
youngberg
v.
romeo,
which
is...
and
in
estelle
v.
gamble,
and
in
both
of
those
cases
there
is
a
distinction
between
a
permissible
level
of
professional
judgment,
even
if
it
is
malpractice
or
negligence
within
that
level
of
judgment,
and
a
decision
that
is
made
that
is
so
far
outside
the
realm
of
the
professionally
acceptable
that
it
can't
be,
and
that's
the
kind
of
thing
we
are
looking
for.
and
let
me
suggest
the
considerations
that
might
follow
that
a
trial
judge
would
utilize
in
determining
whether
or
not
to
let
a
case
go
to
the
jury.
they
would
want
to
determine
whether
those
officials
were
in
lawful
charge.
they
would
want
to
determine
whether
they
had
an
official
duty
to
act,
to
respond.
they
would
want
to
know
whether
they
were
qualified
experts.
indeed,
in
this
case,
hoyt
cupp
was
a
qualified
expert.
they
would
want
to
know
what
kind
of
information
they
possessed:
did
they
really
go
out
and
try
to
find
out
what
was
happening,
as
captain
whitley
did,
actually
visit
the
cell
area
in
order
to
see,
or
were
they
going
on
rumor
and
hearsay
and
other
unreliable
information.
you'd
want
to
know
whether
they
assessed
the
risks,
did
they
actually
take
a
look
at
the
alternatives?
did
they
form
a
plan?
they
formed
a
plan
in
this
case.
they
weighed
it
against
the
possibility
of
tear
gas
and
determined
that
the
threat
to
the
elderly
inmates,
the
fact
that
they
couldn't
clear
the
cellblock
in
time,
the
fact
that
the
other
cell
doors
were
barricaded,
made
that
not
a
realistic
option.
so
you
would
want
in
the
ideal
world
a
weighing
of
options
by
these
professionals.
and
finally
they
formed
a
plan,
and
then
they
followed
according
to
the
plan.
the
shots
that
injured
respondent
albers
were
fired
according
to
a
plan
that
made
it
absolutely
necessary
that
the
entry
and
escape
place,
the
stairs,
was
kept
safe.
now,
once
those
factors
have
been
considered,
that's
the
realm
as
we
understand
it
for
the
operation
of
the
professional
judgment
that
is
at
issue
and
that
we
say
is
one
of
the
criteria
by
which
you
measure
whether
the
eighth
amendment
has
been
violated.
my
fourth
and
final
proposition
is
that
the
ninth
circuit
has
misconstrued
this
court's
learning
in
the
application
of
qualified
immunity.
it
has
reintroduced
a
subjective
test
contrary
to
the
learning
of
this
court
in
harlow
v.
fitzgerald,
and
it
has
totally
ignored
the
fact
that
there
does
not
exist
one
guiding
decision
on
the
level
of
permitted
conduct
by
prison
officials
in
a
riot
situation
that
pre-exists
this
case
that
would
have
given
meaningful
guidance
to
the
conduct
of
prison
officials
in
quelling
the
prison
riot.
for
those
reasons,
we
believe
the
ninth
circuit
has
not
given
sufficient
guidance
and
was
improper
in
not
according
qualified
immunity
to
petitioners...
or
to
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
wish
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
dave
frohnmayer
unless
i
interrupted
your
question.
mr.
dave
frohnmayer
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
believe
i
will
not
require
all
of
the
time,
but
i
wish
to
clarify
some
issues
of
fact,
some
of
law,
and
some
of
concluding
policy.
the
first
one
of
fact
is
that
obviously
the
crisis
was
not
subsiding.
at
best
the
facts
show
that
it
was
a
stalemate,
no
one
had
given
an
inch,
there
was
still
a
hostage
and
still
a
knife-wielding
inmate.
second,
the
evidence
was
that
all
or
almost
all
of
the
inmates
were
out
of
their
cells.
the
third
point,
which
is
much...
is
one
as
much
of
prediction
as
one
of
fact.
it
is
a
point
raised
by
justice
marshall's
colloquy
with
counsel...
is
that
no
one
could
know
what
albers
would
have
done.
this
was
a
split
second
decision.
two
inmates,
one
of
them
albers,
one
another,
were
going
up
the
stairs.
the
presumption
ought
to
have
been
one
of
dangerousness.
the
third
factual
issue
is
that
there
was
no
testimony
so
far
as
i
am
aware
that
the...
all
of
the
other
inmates,
all
199
of
the
others
were
simply
waiting
for
something
to
be
done
about
klenk.
now
some
points
about
law.
tennessee
v
gardner
is
inapt
and
inappropriate
in
the
resolution
of
this
case.
not
only
does
it
deal
with
a
different
amendment,
but
there's
a
very
stark
fact
about
the
difference
between
the
subject
of
the
shooting
in
that
case
and
in
this
case.
here
albers
objectively
was
pursuing
an
unarmed
guard
who
was
attempting
to
rescue
a
person
in
a
position
of
danger.
he
wasn't
fleeing
a
crime,
he
was
running
to
the
maximum
point
of
danger
in
this
prison
at
this
time,
which
was
hostage
cell
no
201.
and
the
notion
that
he
should
have
been
presumed,
constitutionally
presumed
meant
that
the
state
officials
dealing
with
this
issue
should
presume
constitutionally
that
he
would
behave
as
a
law
abiding
citizen
instead
of
a
person
incarcerated
in
a
maximum
security
institution
is
a
presumption
that
flies
against
our
common
sense
and
our
sense
of
justice.
the
second
point
on
the
law
that
i'd
wish
to
leave
with
this
court
is
that
there
was
no
deliberate
indifference
in
this
case.
the
constellation
of
concerns
that
prison
officials
had
to
be
aware
of
included
the
possibility
that
if
the
disturbance
were
to
continue,
the
inmates
would
wreak
violence
on
themselves,
on
the
most
vulnerable
and
weak
of
those
who
were
there,
that
the
hostage
guard
might
be
might
be
further
harmed,
that
indeed,
if
the
riot
or
disturbance
went
on,
that
very
serious
damage
could
occur
to
people.
now,
to
characterize
the
plan
as
deliberately
indifferent
to
that
whole
range
of
concerns
is
to
misuse
the
test
that
this
court
has
articulated.
and
our
point,
i
believe,
is
equally
well
made
by
the
united
states
government
in
its
amicus
curiae
brief
on
pages
21
and
22
on
that
very
point.
the
last
point
with
respect
to
the
law
is
on
the
issue
of
disproportionality
as
counsel
argues.
we
do
not
understand
the
disproportionality
analysis
in
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
cases
to
have
application
to
what
we're
talking
about
here.
it
has
been
evolved
in
the
case
of
sentences
that
has
been
its
sole
restriction,
with
the
exception
of
one
minor
mention
in
rhodes
v
chapman.
finally,
let
me
suggest
the
reality
confronted
by
prison
officials
in
this
case.
every
day
we
are
bombarded
by
headlines
about
hostage
taking,
about
risks,
and
about
alternatives
which
sometimes
end
in
tragedy.
there
are
in
many
of
these
cases
no
risk-free
alternatives,
certainly
in
the
context
of
a
prison
riot
where
there
is
already
a
hostage
and
an
imminent
threat,
not
merely
to
the
hostage
but
to
other
lives.
there
ought
to
be
some
consideration
about
the
fact
that
there
is
no
perfect
answer,
and
that
despite
the
best
of
professional
intentions,
the
result
may
be
tragic.
fortunately
that
was
not
the
result
in
this
case,
where
captain
whitley
deserves
a
badge
of
heroism
and
not
a
civil
rights
action
asking
for
monetary
damages
against
him.
