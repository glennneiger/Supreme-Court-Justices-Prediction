mr.
gene
b.
mechanic
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
about
the
standard
under
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishments
clause,
and
i
believe,
the
due
process
clause,
to
be
applied
to
the
shooting
of
an
unarmed
prisoner
by
prison
officers,
and
whether
under
the
circumstances
here
a
jury
could
have
found
that
defendants
failed
to
meet
that
standard.
we
believe
that
applying
the
correct
legal
standard,
a
jury
would
have
concluded
or
could
have
concluded
that
albers'
constitutional
rights
were
violated
when
he
was
shot.
but
we
further
assert
that
even
under
the
standard,
with
the...
which
the
state
is
suggesting,
a
jury
could
have
round
in
albers'
favor.
thus,
we
urge
the
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
state
has
presented
a
distorted
picture
of
the
events
at
the
oregon
state
penitentiary
on
june
27,
<nineteen
eighty>
[=
1980],
and
has
also
misstated
the
legal
standard
announced
by
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
position
that
albers
is
taking
in
this
case.
with
this
in
mind,
i
wish
to
discuss
the
legal
standard
which
is
not
a
minimal
tort
standard
which
albers
proposes,
and
then
we
can
look
at
the
facts
and
see
whether
the
record
shows,
drawing
all
inferences
in
albers'
favor,
as
we
must
in
a
directed
verdict
case,
that
a
court
erred
in
issuing
a
directed
verdict.
no
one
disagrees
that
under
the
eighth
amendment's
cruel
and
unusual
punishments
clause
a
state
cannot
inflict
the
unnecessary
and
wanton
infliction
of
pain,
and
in
dealing
with
the
due
process
clause,
no
one
disagrees
that
force
used
by
the
state
must
be
reasonably
related
to
legitimate
governmental
objective.
in
fact,
the
interests
involved
here
in
this
case
concerning
the
use
of
deadly
force
is
no
more
than
the...
is
exactly
the
same
interest
that
this
court
dealt
with
in
the
garner
case
last
year
when
it
talked
about
the
use
of
deadly
force
against
a
fleeing
felony
suspect.
mr.
gene
b.
mechanic
yes,
justice
rehnquist.
however,
even
though
this
is
not
a
fourth
amendment
case,
and
even
though
the
constitutional
analysis
may
be
different,
and
in
fact,
the
ultimate
constitutional
standard
may
be
different,
we
are
still
talking
about
the
same
interest.
when
albers
is
shot
and
he
is
likely
to
either
die
or
to
suffer
serious
injury,
it
is
the
same
interest
at
state
from
a
constitutional
perspective
as
the
interest
that
gerald
albers
had,
even
though
we
are
dealing
with
separate
constitutional
principles.
mr.
gene
b.
mechanic
well,
this
court
mentioned
in
the
ingraham
case
that
the
right
to
personal
security
is
similar
under
the
fourth
amendment
as
it
is
under
the
due
process.
so
this
court
has
already
drawn
a
comparison.
mr.
gene
b.
mechanic
correct,
but
it
was
in
the
context
of
a
discussion,
of
course,
of
the
eighth
amendment's
application
to
the
paddling
of
students
in
school.
so
i
am
not
suggesting
that
we
need
to
come
to
the
same
conclusion
on
the
standard.
i
am
only
suggesting
that
the
interest
to
life
that
gerald
albers
had
was
certainly
as
significant
as
the
interest
to
life
that
edwin
garner
had
when
he
was
shot
while
he
was
trying
to
climb
over
the
wall
by
a
police
officer
who
knew
that
he
committed
a
nighttime
burglary,
which
is
a
very
serious
offense.
now,
the
fight
we
have
in
this
case
is
what
these
words,
"unnecessary
and
wanton
infliction
of
pain.
"
and
"reasonable
relation
to
a
legitimate
governmental
interest.
"
really
mean.
the
attorney
general
kept
on
using
these
words,
but
i
still
don't
know
what
standard
the
state
is
really
proposing
that
a
judge
or
jury
should
determine
applies
to
a
case
of
this
nature.
i
believe
that
the
position
i
am
going
to
state
is
more
clear
and
more
inconformity
with
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court
than
the
state's
position.
i
would
like
to
set
forth
the
factors
specifically
that
we
are
proposing
apply
in
a
case
of
this
nature
to
the
shooting
of
a
prisoner
under
the
fourteenth
and
eighth
amendments.
first,
i
believe
that
it
is
crucial
to
look
at
the
degree
of
force.
we
absolutely
agree
that
not
every
showing
of
force
states
a
constitutional
claim.
as
judge
friendly
said
in
the
johnson
v.
glick
case
which
this
court
cited
with
some
approval
again
in
the
ingraham
case
for
the
proposition
that
prison
brutality
is
subject
to
eighth
amendment
analysis,
not
every
push
or
shove
states
a
constitutional
claim.
we
agree
with
that.
but
we
need
not
decide
in
this
case
what
the
exact
line
is
that
needs
to
be
gone
over
because
here
we
are
dealing
with
deadly
force.
the
state
agrees
that
we
are
talking
about
deadly
force.
the
state's
analysis
takes
into
account
in
no
way
how
much
force
is
used.
so
as
far
as
the
state's
analysis
is
concerned,
you
just
don't
need
to
consider
whether
deadly
force
is
used
or
some
other
force,
and
we
think
that
this
court's
analysis
of
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendment
principles
says
that
the
state's
position
is
wrong
on
that.
mr.
gene
b.
mechanic
yes.
i
believe
that
we
can't
make
a
distinction
constitutionally
when
a
police
officer
takes
a
firearm
and
shoots,
even
though
they
are
attempting
to
shoot
low,
and
we
think
that
a
jury
should
consider
that,
we
are
still
talking
about
the
most
severe
force
that
the
government
can
inflict
on
a
member
of
society,
and
we
know
of
various
examples
where,
of
course,
policemen
say
they
have
shot
low
and
they
still
miss.
the
fact
is
albers
was
hit,
he
bled
severely,
he
climbed
up
the
stairs,
he
lost
six
out
of
the
eleven
or
thirteen
pints
of
blood
in
the
body,
he
had
to
take
a
piece
of
clothing
off
of
his
body
to
tie
a
tourniquet
to
stop
the
bleeding,
which
may
have
very
well
saved
his
life.
so
i
think
that
we
have
to
consider
this
to
be
the
same
kind
of
force
that
was
applied
in
the
garner
case.
mr.
gene
b.
mechanic
it
would
depend
on
the
facts
and
circumstances,
justice
powell,
and
i
think
that--
mr.
gene
b.
mechanic
--assuming
that
the
club
was
used
in
a
way
that
it
might
more
commonly
be
used,
which
is
to
incapacitate
but,
and
not
kill,
then
i
would
say
that
would
not
be
deadly
force.
mr.
gene
b.
mechanic
yes,
that's
the
point
i'm
making,
and
that's
the
point
that
mr.
frohnmayer
referred
to
professional
standards.
mr.
gene
b.
mechanic
if
it
had
rubber
bullets,
i
would
say
it
is
not
deadly
force.
professional
standard
clearly
distinguish
firearms
with
real
bullets
from
any
kind
of
use
of
force,
and
that
is
part
of
this
case
as
far
as
the
correction
division's
own
rules--
mr.
gene
b.
mechanic
--it
was--
mr.
gene
b.
mechanic
--no.
6
birdshot.
mr.
gene
b.
mechanic
correct.
it
was
not
the
most
severe
shot,
but
it
was
still
real
bullets--
mr.
gene
b.
mechanic
--well,
i'm
sorry,
i'm
not
as
educated
as
you
are,
justice
powell,
on
that,
but
i
must
say
that
the
real
issue...
we
can
perhaps
draw
some
fine
lines
with
respect
to
what
number
of
birdshot
they
used
and
what
kind
of
specific
force
was
applied,
but
the
fact
is
we
are
talking
about
very
serious
force.
mr.
gene
b.
mechanic
i
would
like...
i
would
like
you
to
have
that
focus.
the
problem
with--
mr.
gene
b.
mechanic
--the
main
focus
of
this
case
is
not
that
an
assault
team
was
sent
into
the
cellblock--
mr.
gene
b.
mechanic
--and
patticu...
yes,
and
particularly
gerald
albers,
because
as
the
circumstances
i
will
state
show,
gerald
albers
was
set
aside
from
what
was
going
on
in
that
cellblock.
mr.
gene
b.
mechanic
i
believe
that
it
in
fact
is,
if
we
are
dealing
with
professional
judgment,
a
substantial
departure
from
professional
judgment
to
shoot
someone,
even
a
prisoner,
without
some
basis
to
believe
that
that
person
is
dangerous,
and
in
fact,
the
only
basis
the
state
of
oregon
has
established
in
this
case
is
that
they
were
prisoners.
prisoners
are
potentially
dangerous.
therefore
they
can
be
shot.
that's
the
logic
that
i
see
from
the
state's
analysis.
mr.
gene
b.
mechanic
i'm
sorry,
justice
marshall.
mr.
gene
b.
mechanic
correct.
mr.
gene
b.
mechanic
one
prisoner
had
a
knife
and
one
prisoner
was
clearly
not
innocent,
and
one
prisoner--
mr.
gene
b.
mechanic
--i
understand
that,
and
i
am
not
here
to
argue
that
any
force
could
not
have
been
plied
against
that
one
prisoner,
and
i
am
not
here
to
argue
that
if
gerald
albers
was
caught
in
the
middle
whereby
they
tried
to
shoot
the
prisoner
who
was
armed
and
they
missed
and
the
bullet
went
into
gerald
albers'
body,
or
if
they
hit
a
wall
and
the
bullet
ricocheted
into
gerald
albers'
body,
that
that
would
state
a
constitutional
claim
because
in
that
instance
we
don't
have
an
element
of
wantonness,
and
that's
what
i'd
like
to
come
to
next.
we
need
to
look
at
the
degree
of
force.
then
we
need
to
look
at
what
wantonness
really
means.
the
state
is
saying
wantonness
means
that
the
only
way
that
albers
can
show
that
he
has
a
constitutional
claim
is
if
the
prisoner
officers
shot
him
solely
for
the
sake
of
inflicting
pain,
with
a
punitive
intent.
that's
wrong.
the
estelle
v.
gamble
case
makes
that
clear
when
it
distinguishes
deliberate
indifference
of
a
medical
officer,
stating
a
constitutional
claim
from
the
intentional
denial
of
medical
care.
going
back
to
the
weems
case,
the
court
said
that
cruelty
under
the
eighth
amendment
is
a
zeal
for
purpose,
whether
honest
or
sinister.
there's
just
no
support
for
the
state's
position
from
cases
i've
read--
mr.
gene
b.
mechanic
--i
take
the
position
that
wantonness,
yes,
justice
o'connor,
is
synonymous
with
recklessness,
with
a
callous
disregard--
mr.
gene
b.
mechanic
--i
believe
that
the
thrust
of
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
is
a
deliberate
indifference
and
recklessness
standard.
they
don't
use
the
terms
"callous
disregard"
or
"reckless
disregard".
they
use
the
term...
they
do
use
the
term
"deliberate
indifference",
and
they
do
recognize
that
the
pain
has
to
be
wanton.
i
think
they
use
the
term
"reasonableness"
in
a
context
that
is
synonymous--
mr.
gene
b.
mechanic
--correct,
but
that
comes
after
the
sentence
describing
the
fact,
after
that,
it
says
"if
an
emergency
plan
was
adopted
with
deliberate
indifference
to
the
right
of
albers.
"
mr.
gene
b.
mechanic
well,
i
would
say
that
the
only
way
you
can
interpret
the
ninth
circuit's
reasoning
correctly
would
be
to
attach
the
conclusion
that
the
thrust
of
their
argument
was
that
there
had
to
be
a
deliberate
indifference,
not
just
an
unnecessariness.
mr.
gene
b.
mechanic
no,
unless
you
interpret
unnecessary
with
gross
disproportionality
to
the
force
that's
used,
and
force
that's
used
that's
clearly
excessive,
to
the
degree
that
you
show
such
reckless
conduct
or
callous
conduct
of
the
nature
that
perhaps
this
court
considered
in
looking
at
the
analysis,
even
in
the
smith
v.
wade
case,
dealing
with
punitive
damages.
we're
talking
about
a
very
high
standard
on
the
spectrum,
and
we're
not
willing
to
go
to
the
state
standard,
which
we
don't
think
is
supportable,
of
actually
having
to
show
full
punitive
intent.
we
think
the
evidence
here
can
meet
that
standard,
but
that's
not
our
position.
so
wantonness
is
the
second
component.
unnecessariness
is
the
third
component.
now,
i'm
not
sure
what
the
state
said
other
than
that
if
the
least
penological
purpose
is
served
by
the
most
excessive
use
of
force,
then
that
is
necessary
for
purposes
of
the
eighth
amendment.
that's
wrong
i
believe.
eighth
amendment
means,
or
the
thrust
of
the
eighth
amendment
is
against
that
which
is
excessive,
as
justice
marshall
said
in
the
furman
case.
but
we're
talking
about
clear
excessiveness.
we're
talking
about
gross
disproportionality.
we're
not
just
dealing
with
a
fine
balancing
test
where
if
we
can
show
that
there
was
a
less
harsh
means
for
taking
care
of
albers,
we
win.
but
we
are
dealing
with
the
most
serious
force
here,
or
certainly
a
very
serious
force.
so
we
think
that
the
gross
disproportionality
standard
certainly
is
a
very
serious
consideration
in
this
case.
finally,
we
would
like
to
look
at
the
degree
of
injury.
we
think
that
there
may
be
some
situations
where
even
though
force
is
applied
unnecessarily
and
wantonly,
the
pain
that
it
causes
is
so
insignificant
that
it
might
not
raise
the
constitutional
dimensions.
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
that
albers
suffered
very
serious
pain,
perhaps
the
most
serious
you
can
suffer
without
actually
dying.
now
i
would
like
to
apply
the
facts
of
this
case
to
these
standards.
we're
not
relying
on
an
expert
battle
here.
we
think
that
a
judge
could
in
fact
issue
a
directed
verdict
even
though
one
expert
says
that
prison
officers
inflicted
unnecessary
and
wanton
pain
on
a
prisoner.
but
we
want
to
look
at
the
actual
facts,
and
i
stress
that
what
the
courts...
what
the
attorney
general
said
was
a
good
closing
argument
to
a
jury,
but
if
you
look
at
this
record,
he
did
not
draw
all
inferences
in
albers'
favor,
and
of
course,
if
there
is
any
substantial
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
albers'
position,
a
directed
verdict
was
improper.
the
jury
should
have
an
opportunity
to
decide
the
question
if
there
is
any
evidence
of
any
sufficiency
to
meet
our
standards.
first,
there
was
not
mass
hysteria
going
on
at
the
time
of
the
shooting.
the
focus
was
on
richard
klenk.
the
security
manager
had
been
inside
that
cellblock
three
times
over
the
hour
and
a
half
period
that
the
disturbance
went
on.
about
a
half
an
hour
before
the
shooting
began,
the
furniture
breaking...
and
there
wasn't
a
lot
of
furniture
in
the
cellblock...
had
stopped.
inmates
were
milling
around,
waiting,
according
to
the
testimony,
for
something
to
be
done
about
klenk.
klenk
did
have
a
knife.
klenk
had
said
that
he
had
killed
an
inmate,
which
was
wrong,
but
we're
assuming
that
whitley
understood
that
he
killed
an
inmate
legitimately.
whitley
said
that
his
main
concern
was
klenk.
the
other
defendants
said
that
their
main
concern
was
klenk.
and
it
had
to
be
because
no
one
was
supporting
klenk.
whitley
never
saw
any
other
inmates
around
klenk
saying
go
ahead,
you
know,
let's
keep
this
thing
going.
whitley
only
was
concerned
about
trying
to
neutralize
klenk.
a
few
moments
before
the
shooting
began,
gerald
albers
was
asked
by
some
inmates
to
come
downstairs
and
to
try
to
help
resolve
the
disturbance.
albers
is
a
pretty
well
respected
inmate.
he's
also
a
well
behaved
inmate.
that's
a
stipulated
fact.
he's
also
in
an
honor
block.
we
understand
they
were
all
maximum
security
prisoners,
but
in
the
context
of
the
prison,
these
prisoners
had
a
history
at
least
for
a
period
of
time
of
good
behavior.
albers
comes
downstairs,
and
he
sees
whitley,
and
he
asks
him,
after
talking
to
some
elderly
inmates
who
are
locked
in
to
the
first
tier,
whether
or
not
whitley
can
help
get
the
elderly
inmates
out
of
the
cellblock
because
albers
and
the
elderly
inmates
were
afraid
that
there
would
be
tear
gas
that
was
being
used--
mr.
gene
b.
mechanic
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
gene
b.
mechanic
if
in
fact
the
facts
showed
here
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
milling
crowd
and
that
the
defendants
really
hadn't
yet
focused
on
albers
and
talked
to
albers
and
had
given
albers
an
indication
that
he
should
stay
downstairs
to
help
the
elderly
inmates
get
out,
which
is
what
whitley
told
albers,
according
to
the
record,
as
the
evidence
stands,
whitley
says
to
albers,
okay,
i'll
come
back
with
the
key.
why
didn't
he
tell
albers
to
go
back
to
his
cell?
he
didn't
do
that.
i
submit
that
a
jury
could
infer
that
at
that
moment,
whatever
cell-in
orders
had
been
issued
before
as
far
as
albers
were
concerned
was
no
longer
in
effect.
so
we're
focusing
in
on
what
the
defendants
knew
in
this
case.
if
we're
dealing
with
a
mass
disturbance
where
split
second
decisions
need
to
be
made,
of
course
we
can't
expect
prison
officers
to
make
judgments
as
to
who
is
responsible
and
who
is
not,
but
that's
not
the
facts
we
have
here.
mr.
gene
b.
mechanic
at
the
time
the
shooting
began,
yes,
but
only
to
this
extent.
riot
is
a
very
nebulous
term,
justice
rehnquist.
under
common
definitions,
a
riot
is
any
time
three
or
more
people
get
together
and
act
tumultuously
and
violently.
what
the
state
seems
to
be
suggesting
here
is
that
because
we
attach
the
term
"riot"
to
this
case,
it
creates
all
new
sorts
of
constitutional
issues.
i
don't
think
that's
the
case.
i
think
what
we
need
to
do
is
establish
the
correct
legal
standard
to
apply
as
far
as
a
use
of
force
against
prisoners
as
a
general
matter.
to
the
extent
that
a
riot
is
in
effect,
we
need
to
see
whether
or
not
the
circumstances,
how
those
particular
circumstances
apply
to
that
legal
standard.
mr.
gene
b.
mechanic
i
think
that
if
we
establish
the
basic
legal
standard
we
are
proposing,
someone
brings
a
complaint,
those
circumstances
would
have
to
be
judged,
and
in
many
cases
a
judge
would
properly
issue
a
directed
verdict.
but
that's
not
the
case
here
because
judge
panner
resolved
very
important
facts
which
another
person
may
have
resolved
differently.
for
example,
if
one
inmate
is
holding
a
bomb
or
a
grenade,
that's
not
a
riot
under
proper
definition,
but
it's
equally
as
serious
or
more
serious
than
the
situation
we
have
here.
mr.
gene
b.
mechanic
correct.
mr.
gene
b.
mechanic
i
understand
your
point,
justice
marshall.
mr.
gene
b.
mechanic
correct.
mr.
gene
b.
mechanic
they
knew
that
mr.
albers
was
unarmed,
and
they
knew
that
the
other
inmates
down
there--
mr.
gene
b.
mechanic
--well,
the
presumption
has
to
be
that
they
had
no
basis
to
believe
that
he
was
armed.
mr.
gene
b.
mechanic
when
mr.--
mr.
gene
b.
mechanic
--well,
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
justice
marshall,
i
don't
believe
it
would
be
because
the
security
people
had
ample
opportunity
to
go
in
there
and
view
the
situation,
and
as
far
as
the
inmates
immediately
down
in
the
open
area,
they
talked
to
richard
klenk
and
talked
to
gerald
albers,
and
the
only
indication
they
had
was
albers
was
there
to
help
in
some
way,
and
they
gave
albers
approval
to
help.
we
weren't
dealing
with
a
lot
of
inmates
in
that
open
area--
mr.
gene
b.
mechanic
--there
were
only
a
handful.
mr.
gene
b.
mechanic
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gene
b.
mechanic
no,
i--
mr.
gene
b.
mechanic
--i'm...
we
agreed
that
there
was
a
riot
under
your
common
definition
that
evening.
i
believe
there
may
be
a
question
as
to
what
was
going
on
right
at
the
end
that
a
jury
would
have
to
resolve.
but
we're
not
questioning
that
you
cannot
term
this
as
a
riot.
i'm
only
stressing
that
the
word
"riot"
brings
in
so
many
different
sets
of
circumstances--
mr.
gene
b.
mechanic
--that
we
can't
attach
absolute--
mr.
gene
b.
mechanic
--correct.
mr.
gene
b.
mechanic
no,
it
doesn't,
but
i...
there
were
a
number
of...
there
were
200
inmates
in
that
cellblock,
and--
mr.
gene
b.
mechanic
--correct,
except
for
gerald
albers,
i
believe,
who
was
told
to
remain
there
while
mr.
whitley
got
the
key.
so
we're
not
questioning
there
wasn't
some
disobedience
of
a
cell-in
order.
the
inmates
basically
were
standing
around,
standing
outside
their
cells
on
different
tiers,
looking,
seeing
what
was
going
on
down
in
the
open
area.
that
certainly
is
a
violation
of
the
cell-in
order,
but
the
violation
was
only
to
that
extent.
now,
what
happened
next
is
when
mr.
whitley
went
out,
he
talked
to
cupp
and
he
talked
to
kennicott,
and
a
decision
was
made
to
shoot
anyone
going
up
those
stairs.
the
only
way
albers
had
a
chance
to
get
back
to
his
cell
was
going
up
those
stairs.
so
he's
waiting
for
whitley
to
come
back,
expecting
whitley
to
help
get
the
elderly
inmates
out.
by
the
way,
under
this
case,
the
experts
said
that
it's
appropriate
professional
procedure
to
allow
inmates
who
don't
want
to
get
involved
in
a
disturbance
to
leave.
instead
of,
however,
coming
back
with
a
key,
whitley
comes
back,
he
says
let's
go,
shoot
the
bastards,
and
starts
running
up
the
cell.
albers
hears
those
words,
he
sees
firearms,
he
starts
hightailing
back
to
his
cell.
he
turns
around,
glances
over
his
shoulder,
and
he
sees
a
rifle,
he
freezes...
this
is
the
testimony...
he
looks
kennicott
right
in
the
eye,
kennicott
admitted
he
knew
albers,
he
knew
he
was
well-behaved,
and
then
albers
is
shot.
there's
no
basis
to
believe
albers
was
dangerous.
and
even
applying
any
semblance
of
the
garner
reasoning
without
expecting
even
a
probable
cause
standard,
can
we
shoot
someone
without
any
basis
to
believe
that
they're
dangerous,
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
given
the
particular
exigencies
that
i
have
discussed.
i
think
that's
an
appropriate
question
for
a
jury,
and
that's
really
all
we
need
to
decide
here.
mr.
cupp
said
that
anyone
outside
their
cell
was
fair
game.
that's
an
indication,
i
believe,
along
with
whitley's
statement
of
shoot
the
bastards,
but
even
the
punitive
intent
to
get
albers,
for
some
reason,
was
there.
so
we
could
meet
that
standard.
but
even
under
our
correct
analysis,
or
under
our
correct
analysis
of
the
constitutional
standard,
the
deadly
force
was
inflicted
unnecessarily,
which
means
grossly
disproportionate
to
any
need,
and
wantonly
reckless
disregard.
they
never
gave
albers
a
warning.
they
never
gave
him
a
way
out.
even
garner
was
told
to
halt
before
he
was
shot.
even
the
tennessee
statute
that
you
dealt
with
in
that
case
required
a
warning
of
"halt"
before
using
deadly
force.
there
were
no
words
spoken
to
gerald
albers
before
he
was
shot.
potential
dangerousness
is
not
sufficient
to
use
deadly
force,
and
that's
all
the
state
has
said
in
tis
case
they
have.
maybe
a
jury
would
conclude
that
what
they
did
was
constitutionally
proper,
but
under
the
circumstances
and
the
proper
standard
to
be
applied,
a
jury
could
also
reasonably
have
concluded
that
what
they
did
was
improper
constitutionally.
the
principle
that
juries
are
links
to
the
public
attitude
of
contemporary
standards
of
decency
under
the
eighth
amendment,
are
still
good
law,
and
juries
perform
this
historical
function
day
in
and
day
out,
and
they
apply
the
same
standards
we're
suggesting
day
in
and
day
out.
it's
our
position
that
they
should
be
allowed
to
apply
those
standards
in
this
case,
assuming
the
judge
finds
that
there
is
sufficient
evidence
in
the
record
to
raise
to
the
standards
that
we're
discussing.
mr.
gene
b.
mechanic
one
quick
thing
on
immunity,
justice
brennan.
we
believe
the
law
was
clear
at
the
time
that
prison
officers
could
not
use
grossly
disproportionate
and
excessive
force.
that's
the
standard
we
are
relying
on.
whether
a
riot
in
fact
provided
them
with
the
circumstances
so
that
they
should
not
he
held
liable
on
the
merits
is
one
thing,
but
we
cannot
have
a
riot
exception
carved
out
of
the
legal
standard.
so
the
law
was
clear.
the
ninth
circuit
reasoning
i
am
not
supporting.
we
did
not
argue
that
reasoning.
we
argued
simply
that
under
the
harlow
standard,
the
law
was
clear
at
the
time
that
you
have
a
principle
of
what
unnecessary
and
wanton
infliction
of
pain
means,
by
repeated
circuit
court
decisions
and
the
general
doctrines
of
this
court.
one
point
about
the
riot
in
answering
justice
brennan's
inquiry
about
my
discussing
immunity.
the
state
admits
that
if
they
dropped
napalm
on
the
cellblock,
that
might
be
a
constitutional
violation
because
it
would
show
imputed
intent.
but
under
their
immunity
argument
they
would
be
immune
because
there
was
never
a
court
decision
that
dealt
with
a
riot
and
told
them
what
they
could
do
or
could
not
do
in
the
use
of
force.
that
stresses
and
highlights
the
weakness
of
the
state's
position
on
the
kind
of
identity
you
need
to
meet
this
court's
requirement
that
there
be
a
clear
constitutional
principle.
thank
you
very
much.
