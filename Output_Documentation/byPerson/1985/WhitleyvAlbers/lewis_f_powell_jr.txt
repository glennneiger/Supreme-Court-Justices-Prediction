justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
general,
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
viewed
this
as
an
eighth
amendment
case--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--not
a
due
process
case.
and
what
standard
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
applied?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
used
the
term
"reasonableness"
and
"reasonable"
several
times,
but
it
also
referred
to
our
decision
in
estelle
where
a
deliberate
indifference
was
a
standard.
so
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
used
both
of
those
standards
more
or
less
interchangeably.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
court
does
purport
to
apply
both
standards
and
more
or
less
homogenizes
the
two
standards,
doesn't
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
this
question?
the
guards
were
instructed
to
shoot
low
and
also
to
give
warning
shots.
i
would
quite
agree
that
they
could
have
been
inaccurate
and
could
have
shot
high
instead
of
low,
but
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
could
you
say
there
was
a
deliberate
use
of
deadly
force?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
the
officers
had
only
used,
what
do
you
call
them,
billies
or
the
sort
of
sticks
or
clubs
that
police
officers
normally
carry,
and
had
hit
and
killed
a
prisoner,
would
that
have
been
the
use
of
deadly
force
intentionally?
it
would
depend
on
the
facts
and
circumstances,
of
course.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--i
am
really
trying
to
get
at
whether
or
not
the
fact
that
a
firearm
was
used
rather
than
some
other
weapon
is
the
point
you
are
making.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
could
it
have
rubber
bullets
and--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
no.
6
is
used
for
squirrels.
no.
8
and
no.
9
and
no.
10
are
used
for
birds.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--it's
not
disputed,
is
it,
that
the
prison
guards
had
reason
to
believe
that
one
inmate
had
been
killed.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that's
a
fact,
and
it
also
is
a
fact
that
the
inmates
were
milling
around,
whatever
that
means,
and
you
would
not
use
the
term
"riot"
in
light
of
those
circumstances?
i
realize--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--you
say
it's
ambiguous,
but
couldn't
you?
