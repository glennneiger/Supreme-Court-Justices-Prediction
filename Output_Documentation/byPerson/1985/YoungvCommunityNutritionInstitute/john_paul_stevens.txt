justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
interrupt
before
you
do?
do
you
contend
that
the
determination
of
an
action
level
is
the
promulgating
of
a
regulation
within
the
meaning
of
406?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't.
okay.
i
misunderstood
what
you
said.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that,
but
they
are
not
regulations.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
are
basically
a
policy
statement
that
we
will
not
prosecute
if
you
don't
exceed
this
action
level.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
may
be,
but
legally
they
have
no
different
effect
than
just
an
announcement
of
a
policy
that
we
won't
prosecute
above
this
level.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
may
go
through
a
lot
of
thinking
before
they
come
to
the
conclusion,
but
none
of
that
is
statutorily
required.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--let
me
ask
one
more
question,
if
i
may,
before
you
get
into
the
argument.
this
figure,
of
either
eight
action
levels
or
21,
does
that
relate
only
to
section
406,
the
one
where
the
added
substance
is
unavoidable?
is
it
that
category?
does
that
also
include
the
pesticides
and
the
food
additives
and
action
levels
of
that
kind?
justice
john
paul
stevens
where
they
do
have
tolerances
in
every
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
state
the
question
a
little
differently.
is
it
correct
that
the
eight
action
levels
or
21,
whichever
it
is,
applies
entirely
to
section
406
cases,
cases
where
the
substance
is
unavoidably
part
of
the
product?
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
mr.
larkin,
your
view?
you
have
to
read,
i
guess,
406
together
with
402(a)(2),
or
the
second
part
of
402,
and
the
first
part
says
an
added
substance
makes
the
food
unsafe,
i
mean,
makes
it
misbranded
or
adulterated
if
it
is
unsafe.
then
there
is
the
second
alternative.
it
is
also
unsafe
if
it
doesn't
comply
with
406.
and
my
question
is...
and
then
406
says...
provides
for
this
tolerance
procedure.
what
is
your
view
if
something
is
not
unsafe
within
the
meaning
of
402(a)(1)
but
has
an
additive
in
it
that
it
unavoidable
and
is
below
the
level
of
an
action
level
letter?
is
it
unsafe
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
do
i
make
my
question
clear?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
only
unsafe
if
it
exceeds
an
established
tolerance.
is
that
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
there
is
no
established
tolerance,
and
therefore
it
doesn't
exceed
an
established
tolerance,
and
you
also
cannot
prove
unsafeness
within
402(a)(1),
it
is
not
adulterated.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
is
regardless
of
whether
it
is
below
or
above
an
action
level.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
can
prove,
but
you
still
must.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
am
saying...
i
am
positing
a
case
in
which
you
cannot
prove
in
a
particular
case
on
safeness,
but
then
it
is
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
not
unsafe.
justice
john
paul
stevens
whereas
if
you
have
a
tolerance,
then
the
answer
to
the
unsafeness
question
depends
on
whether
it
is
below
or
above
the
tolerance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
as
simple
as
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
disagree
with
that
sentence,
do
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
existence
of
the
regulation
would
operate
to
render
it
legal,
unadulterated.
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
that
really
demonstrates
is,
that
is
an
incorrect
reason
for
the
result
they
reached.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
left
the
exception
out
of
the
first
sentence
of
406.
it
says
it
shall
be
deemed
unsafe
unless
it
is
within
the
tolerance,
doesn't
it?
isn't
that
when
you
read
the
whole
thing
together?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
the
except
clause
you
are
talking
about?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
says,
"except
where
it
is
unavoidable".
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
you
again?
is
it
not
true
that
402(a)(1)
refers
to
substances
which
include
all
substances,
whether
they
contain
additives
or
not,
and
402(a)(2)
deals
with
additives?
justice
john
paul
stevens
with
no
additive
present,
so
it
is
not
totally
redundant.
it
covers
all
substances
in
which
there
is
no
additive.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
that
is
the
general
basic
prohibition
in
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
covers
everything.
the
whole
402(a)(1)
is
not
totally
redundant
by
their
reading
of
406.
justice
john
paul
stevens
insofar
as
it
relates
to
additives.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
there
is
an
elaborate
code
on
additives
of
which
406
is
a
part.
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
be
partially
redundant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
it
authorized
them
to
issue
tolerances,
not
action
levels.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
schultz,
what
do
you
do
with
your
opponent's
argument
that
the
tolerance
is
really
kind
of
a
two-edged
sword?
on
the
one
hand,
it
establishes
a
minimum
that
can't
be
exceeded,
but
also
it
establishes
protection
for
the
user
of
a
product,
i
mean,
the
manufacturer
of
a
product,
and
that
if
you
freeze
the
level
at
a
certain
point,
then
there
is
an
exemption,
and
they
discover
more
information,
they
put
it
too
low,
the
public
is
jeopardized
by
not
being
able
to
change
it
on
short
notice.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
referred
earlier
to
the
experience
with
pesticides
where
they
had
100
different
action
levels,
and
they
were
going
to
get
tolerances
for
all
of
them.
was
the
initiative
for
getting
tolerances
for
all
the
pesticides,
did
that
come
from
the
fda
or
from
industry
asking
for
the
levels
that
would
enable
them
to
operate
safely?
do
you
know?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
there
is
no
initiative
from
the
farmers,
i
guess,
here
to
get
tolerance
level
for
this
particular
additive.
