mr.
larkin,
i
know
that
both
sides
agree
that
aflatoxin
is
an
added
substance,
but
it
isn't
immediately
apparent
to
me
why
it
should
be
considered
an
added
substance
at
all.
doesn't
it
grow
naturally
in
certain
crops?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
anything
that
isn't
part
of
the
genetic
code
of
the
substance
is
added?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
agree
that
normally
it
takes
many
months
in
some
cases
years
to
go
through
the
regulation
adoption
procedure?
