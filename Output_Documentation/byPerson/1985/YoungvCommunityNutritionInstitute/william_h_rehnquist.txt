are
those
things
that
we
presume
congress
wanted
from
the
agency?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
it
is
a
good
idea
or
not?
isn't
it
a
question
whether
congress
mandated
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
you
say
that
it
is
absolutely
irrational
to
read
the
thing
as
modifying
something
that
close
to
it?

william
h.
rehnquist
congress
had
never
heard
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
in
1938,
had
it?
