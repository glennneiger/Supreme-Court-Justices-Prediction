mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
the
question
in
this
case
involves
the
proper
construction
of
two
interrelated
sections
of
the
food,
drug,
and
cosmetic
act
of
1938,
section
402
and
section
406.
these
sections
establish
alternative
enforcement
mechanisms
that
provide
the
fda
with
the
ability
to
prove
that
food
is
adulterated.
it
is
our
position
and
it
has
been
the
position
of
the
food
and
drug
administration
in
the
nearly
50-year
history
that
the
act
has
been
in
existence
that
section
406
authorizes
the
agency
to
adopt
regulations,
known
as
tolerances,
but
does
not
require
the
agency
to
do
so.
put
another
way,
congress
authorized
the
food
and
drug
administration
to
select
between
the
alternative
types
of
enforcement
mechanisms
that
were
established
in
the
1938
act.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
correct.
it
could
decide
that
in
an
individual
case
it
should
prosecute
under
the
general
adulteration
standard,
section
402,
or
alternatively
it
could
decide
to
adopt
tolerances,
regulations
that
would
set
precise
levels
of
forbidden
contamination,
and
that
would
lead
to
a
different
type
of
proof
in
court
in
an
individual
case.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that's
correct.
by
saying
that
they
could
choose
between
the
two,
i
mean
that
they
can,
as
a
policy
matter,
decide
how
to
proceed
to
protect
the
public
health.
once
a
tolerance
is
set,
they
cannot
then
proceed
under
the
general
adulteration
standard.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
correct.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
they
are
called
action
levels,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that's
correct.
i
would
like
to
summarize
the
four
principal
reasons
why
we
believe
the
court
of
appeals
misconstrued
the
act
in
this
case.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
i
am
sorry,
and
i
would
like
to
be
precise
about
this,
because
i
think
respondents
have
attempted
to
confuse
the
two.
action
levels
are
informal
and
internal
prosecutorial
guidelines.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
correct,
they
do
not
have
the
force
and
effect
of
law.
tolerances
do;
action
levels
do
not,
and
they
never
have.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
it
is
more
than
just
a
policy
statement,
your
honor,
because
the
action
levels
represent
the
agency's
judgment
based
on
the
available
scientific
data
as
to
what
level
of
contamination
will
result
in
adulteration,
so
the
action
levels
also
represent
the
agency's
judgment
as
to
what
it
can
prove
in
an
individual
case
will
result
in
adulteration.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
correct,
the
statute
does
not
require
the
establishment
of
action
levels,
and
the
statute
does
not
impose
any
legal
consequences
upon
the
violation
of
an
action
level--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--correct.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
correct.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
the
reason
we
made--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--that's
correct,
because
if
the
agency
has
new
data
that
leads
the
agency
to
believe
that
its
prior
action
level
was
insufficient
to
protect
the
public
health,
that
in
fact
a
lower
level
of
contamination
may
result
in
adulteration.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
they
are
published
in
the
federal
register,
your
honor.
if
the
agency
discovers
new
information,
as
it
did,
for
example,
in
1974
with
respect
to
pvb
contamination
in
michigan,
it
can
lower
the
action
level
without
going
through
the
formal
rulemaking
process.
that
will
allow
the
agency
to
act
quickly
in
response
to
new
developments.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
the
agency
has
the
authority
to
prosecute
before
it
lowers
its
action
levels
as
well.
that
is
correct.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
once
a
tolerance
is
established,
any
food
that
contains
a
contaminant
for
which
the
tolerance
is
established
that
has
a
lower
level
of
contamination
than
the
tolerance
permits
is
per
se
unadulterated,
and
the
fda
cannot
then
go
into
court
and
prove
that
despite
all
the
new
evidence
it
has
uncovered,
for
example,
in
the
1974
case,
that
this
particular
food
may
be
adulterated.
the
statute
prevents
the
fda
from
relying
on
the
general
adulteration
standard.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
they
are
relatively
infrequent
both
for...
primarily
historical
reasons,
but
also
practical
reasons.
in
1938,
when
congress
adopted
the
statute,
the
primary
added
contaminant
that
they
were
concerned
with
was
pesticides.
and
the
fda
thereafter,
after
a
period
during
world
war
two
when
business
was
diverted
to
other
matters,
established
a
pesticide
tolerance
in
1944
for
florium.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
there
is
one
other
tolerance
level
for
pcbs.
now,
after
1944--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--there
are
at
least
eight
substances
that
the
fda
has
action
levels
for
at
present,
and
it
has
21
action
levels
for
these
eight
substances,
because
the
different
substances
may
be
ingested
in
different
foods,
different
foods
may
be
consumed
in
different
quantities,
and
different
foods
may
be--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--we
believe
that
we
would
have
to
at
least
set
that
many
different
tolerances,
and
for
substances
for
which
we
do
not
yet
know,
every
time
a
substance
is
discovered
we
have
to
set
a
tolerance
level
under
the
court
of
appeals
construction
of
the
statute.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that
is
true,
but
the
agency
has
long
concluded
that
the
public
is
not
materially
benefitted
by
virtue
of
having
tolerances
in
effect.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
i
agree,
and
for
that
i
would
like
to,
if
i
could,
return
to
the
four
primary
reasons
why
we
believe
the
court
of
appeals
erred.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
the
pesticides
are
now
primarily
regulated
under
section
408
or
346.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
i
believe
the
epa
sets
the
tolerances,
and
i
am
not
sure
if
there
is
a
tolerance
set
in
every
case.
i
believe
there
probably
would
be
because
there
is
a
procedure
that
allows
both
industry
and
private
parties
to
select--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--yes,
the
eight
action
levels
deal
with
substances
that
are
either
necessary
or
unavoidable--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--the
four
reasons
are
as
follows.
first,
the
fda's
construction
of
the
act
is
eminently
rational
and
entirely
plausible.
it
is
consistent
with
the
text
and
overall
structure
of
the
act,
with
the
legislative
history,
and
the
'38
act
and
subsequent
amendments,
and
with
the
policies
that
congress
sought
to
implement
through
the
statute.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
the
construction
goes
back
at
least
to
1940,
when
in
a
published
letter
that
was
sent
to
certain
private
parties
the
agency
made
clear
its
position.
that
letter
is
reprinted
in
a
footnote
to
our
brief
at
page
17,
note
14.
the
agency's
construction
has
been
consistent
throughout
this
period.
it
has
never
construed
the
act
as
requiring
it
to
adopt
tolerances.
it
has
always
construed
it
as
the
authorizing
agency
to
do
so.
second,
the
court
of
appeals
upset
the
settled
and
successful
administrative
construction
of
a
complex
regulatory
scheme
largely
by
relying
on
one
word
in
one
clause
in
one
section
of
a
multipart
statute.
by
so
doing,
the
court
of
appeals
effectively
misunderstood
the
function
that
congress
intended
section
406
to
serve--
third,
congress
has
been
made
aware
of
the
agency's
construction
and
the
agency's
regulatory
position,
and
congress
has
never
criticized
the
agency
for
the
practice
it
has
followed,
and
in
fact
in
1954
congress
relied
on
the
agency's
views
when
congress
adopted
an
amendment
to
the
act.
fourth,
neither
the
court
of
appeals
nor
the
respondents
have
offered
a
sound
reason
why
congress
would
have
intended
the
regulatory
process
to
be
structured
in
an
entirely
different
fashion
or
why
it
should
be
restructured
in
a
new
fashion
at
this
late
date.
in
fact,
as
we
explained,
restructuring
the
process
in
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
and
respondents
suggest
would
not
materially
benefit
the
public,
and
would
in
fact
pose
substantial
risks
that
the
fda
would
not
be
able
to
protect
the
public
in
the
way
that
it
has
historically
seen
best.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
congress
provided
for
tolerances
because
the
agency
believed
that
the
ability
to
adopt
legislative
rules
would
enhance
its
ability
to
protect
the
public
health.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
no,
the
agency
with
the
initial
problem
of
dealing
with
pesticides
adopted
a
pesticide
tolerance
in
1944.
in
1954,
there
was
no
longer
any
need
to
proceed
under
section
406
because
the
pesticide
amendment
provided
a
new
and
speedier
procedure
to
adopt
tolerances.
the
types
of
added
contaminants
with
which
we
are
concerned
today
are
unavoidable
contaminants
that
for
the
most
paft
were
not
discovered
until
beginning
in
the
1960s,
when
aflatoxin,
for
example,
was
discovered.
the
data
about
that
is
still
coming
in
in
a
variety
of
different
cases,
but
more
importantly,
the
fda
has
believed
that
on
the
one
hand
the
benefits
of
having
tolerances
adopted
in
every
case
do
not
materially
advance
its
ability
to
protect
the
public
health,
and
on
the
other
hand
there
is
a
substantial
risk
that
once
a
tolerance
is
set,
the
agency
might
not
be
able
to
respond
quickly
in
order
to
protect
the
public
health
if
there
are
new
developments.
the
events
that
gave
rise
to
this
suit
occurred
in
1980.
in
that
year,
the
level
of
aflatoxin
contamination
in
corn
in
three
states,
virginia,
north
carolina,
and
south
carolina,
was
unusually
high.
roughly
100
million
bushels
of
corn
valued
at
$319.5
million
were
affected.
because
of
the
size
of
the
potential
loss,
and
because
the
corn
could
be
used
in
a
way
that
would
not
injure
the
public
health,
the
three
states
asked
the
fda
not
to
recommend
an
enforcement
action.
the
fda
agreed
with
the
request
as
long
as
certain
stringent
conditions
were
met,
one
of
which
was
that
the
food
not
be
used
for
consumption
by
humans.
in
a
letter
submitted
to
the
fda,
respondents
objected
to
the
fda's
decision,
and
asked
the
fda
to
rescind
its
decision
in
this
respect.
after
the
fda
refused
to
alter
its
decision,
respondent
brought
this
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
on
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment,
the
district
court
granted
the
secretary's
motion.
the
three
claims
that
the
district
court
addressed
resulted
in
only
one
issue
before
this
court.
that
issue
is
whether
or
not
section
406
requires
the
agency
to
adopt
tolerances.
the
district
court
believed
that
when
the
statute
is
construed
as
a
whole,
section
406
grants
the
agency
the
discretionary
authority
to
adopt
tolerances,
but
does
not
impose
an
obligation
on
the
agency
to
do
so.
now,
the
d.c.
circuit
reversed.
relying
entirely
on
the
literal
language
of
the
statute,
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
despite
the
agency's
historic
construction
to
the
contrary,
the
act
required
the
agency
to
adopt
tolerances
in
every
case.
the
court
of
appeals
found
the
legislative
history
unilluminative,
and
the
purpose
the
that
court
of
appeals
gave
for
its
reading
of
the
statute,
we
believe,
is
narrow.
now,
the
central
issue
in
this
case
is
what
function
did
congress
intend
section
406
to
serve.
when
that
function
is
understood,
we
believe
that
it
becomes
manifest
that
the
agency's
construction
of
the
statute
is
correct,
and
that
the
agency
has
been
correctly
applying
the
act
for
the
nearly
50-year
period
it
has
been
in
existence.
the
pivotal
provision
in
this
regard
is
section
406.
section
406
was
added
in
the
1938
act,
which
was
not
the
initial
act
that
was
adopted
to
protect
the
public
health.
that
was
the
1906
act.
in
the
1906
act,
adulterated
food
was
not
allowed
to
be
shipped
in
interstate
commerce.
the
only
way
the
agency
could
establish
that
food
was
adulterated
was
by
proving
in
an
individual
case
that
the
presence
of
a
contaminant
in
the
food
may
render
it
injurious
to
health.
that
was
the
precise
holding
that
this
court
handed
down
in
the
lexington
mill
case.
now,
that
was
a
valuable
construction
of
the
statute
for
the
agency,
because
the
agency
did
not
have
to
prove
that
it
would
necessarily
injure
the
public
in
every
case.
but
nonetheless,
the
agency
believed
that
its
enforcement
powers
could
be
enhanced
by
gaining
the
ability
to
adopt
legislative
rules
that
would
allow
it
to
set
precise
levels
of
contamination.
in
the
1933
version
of
the
act
which
was
drafted
by
the
agency,
the
agency
sought
approval
to
adopt
the
legislative
rules
known
as
tolerances.
the
agency
did
so
because
it
believed
that
in
some
cases,
the
case-by-case
method
could
be
superseded
by
regulation.
and
it
also
believed
that
by
adopting
legislative
rules
it
could
take
into
account
the
presence
of
contaminants
in
other
foods
in
the
environment
as
well
as
the
food
that
was
under
consideration.
throughout
the
entire
course,
throughout
the
entire
five-year
course
of
this
legislation
through
congress,
no
one
ever
suggested
that
the
agency
should
be
required
to
adopt
tolerances.
in
fact,
the
initial
bill
that
the
agency
drafted
and
submitted
to
congress
that
is
now
found
in
contained
the
same
word,
406,
but
the
agency
construed
the
statute
as
being
discretionary,
not
mandatory.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
we
believe
that
the
verb
"shall"
has
to
be
read
in
conjunction
with
the
phrase,
"to
such
extent
as
he
finds
necessary
to
protect
the
public
health.
"
when
that
is
read
as
a
whole,
we
believe
it
allows
the
secretly
the
discretion
to
decide
whether
it
is
necessary
to
protect
the
public
health
to
adopt
tolerances,
that
the
verb
"shall"
can't
be
isolated
from
that
following
phrase
simply
because
there
are
a
few
other
words
that
intervene
in
the
statute,
and
that
is
amply
demonstrated,
we
believe,
by
the
legislative
history.
as
i
said,
the
fda
drafted
the
statute,
and
yet
at
the
same
time,
even
though
it
contained
the
same
verb,
the
fda
construed
it
as
being
discretionary.
senator
copeland
sponsored
the
legislation,
and
senator
copeland
construed
it
as
being
discretionary.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
it
may
not
be
in
that
sense,
but
the
problem,
the
issue
here
really
is
that
no
one
at
the
time
thought
that
that
made
a
difference.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
since
then,
this
is
the
first
court
of
appeals
to
have
held
that
the
agency
cannot
rely
on
its
action
levels.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
the
agency
has
consistently
construed
it
from
the
day
it
went
into
effect
as
being
discretionary.
the
agency
has
stated
that
on
numerous
occasions.
the
agency
stated
it
in
public
correspondence
issued
shortly
after
the
act
went
into
effect.
that
was
in
1940.
the
agency
said
that
in
1950,
when
it
went
before
congress
to
obtain
a
modification
of
the
statute
that
it
didn't
believe
it
had
to
adopt
tolerances,
but
that
it
wanted
to,
and
wanted
a
speedier
procedure
to
do
so.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
i
think
i
understand
your
question,
your
honor.
it
would
net
because
in
part
since
it--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--it
is
only
unsafe
under
section
406
and
section
402(a)(2)(a).
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
if
it
exceeds
an
established
tolerance.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
correct.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
if
it
is
above
the
action
level,
that
means
we
can
probably
prove
that
it
is
adulterated.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
yes.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that
would
be
correct.
we
would
have
to
prove
if
there
is
no
tolerance
in
effect
that
it
may
injure
human
health--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--right.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
the
tolerance
would
provide
the
answer
in
every
case.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
it
may
depend
on
the
type
of
evidence
that
was
adduced
in
the
particular
case--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--let
me
turn
to
the
statute
then
so
that
i
can
explain
why
we
believe
the
court
of
appeals
erred.
one
of
the
reasons
given
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
reading
section
406
as
mandatory
is
that
it
believed
that
in
the
absence
of
the
tolerance,
food
containing
any
contaminant
such
a
aflatoxin,
that
is,
a
necessary
or
unavoidable
contaminant,
was
automatically
adulterated,
and
that
the
tolerance
was
necessary
to
allow
this
food
to
be
shipped
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
we
think
that
at
three
different
places
the
court
of
appeals
makes
that
position
clear.
for
example,
at
page
4a,
the
first
full
paragraph,
the
second
sentence,
beginning,
"hence",
the
court
of
appeals
says,
"section
342
would,
except
for
the
saving
grace
of
section
346,
define
any
aflatoxin-tainted
corn
to
be
adulterated
and
such
corn
would
therefore
be
banned
from
interstate
commerce.
"
at
page
7a,
the
court
of
appeals
goes
on
to
say,
"since
the
existence
of
a
regulation
operates
to
render
the
food
legally
unadulterated,
the
statute
in
our
view
plainly
requires
the
establishment
by
regulation
of
tolerances
before
aflatoxin-tainted
corn
may
lawfully
be
shipped
in
interstate
commerce,
and--
"
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--we
disagree
because
they
confuse
to
contepts
there.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
it
would,
if
the
contaminant
were
an
amount
below
the
tolerance,
but
the
second
half
of
that
sentence
doesn't
follow
from
the
first.
the
existence
of
the
regulation
would
allow
the
food
to
be
shipped
in
interstate
commerce
if
it
contained
less
than
the
tolerance
level,
but
you
don't
need
to
establish
the
tolerance
in
order
to
exempt
a
contaminated
food
from
being
adulterated.
the
tolerances
operate
in
the
other
sense.
the
court
of
appeals
believed
that
you
had
to
adopt
tolerances
because
they
were
the
only
way
of
rendering
a
food
unadulterated,
and
we
think
the
statute
doesn't
reach
that
far.
the
second
clause
itself
refers
to
tolerances
so
fixed,
which
means
the
tolerance
has
to
be
in
effect.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that's
correct,
and
in
fact
respondents
have
now
abandoned
that
argument
themselves,
but
in
addition,
the
court
of
appeals'
construction
of
the
statute
also
renders
the
general
adulteration
standard
in
section
402(a)(1)
superfluous,
reasoning
as
follows.
if
a
contaminant
can
be
avoided
or
is
not
necessary,
the
first
clause
of
section
406
forbids
its
addition
in
food.
any
food
containing
that
type
of
substance
is
adulterated.
so
what
you
are
left
with
then
are
contaminants
that
either
are
necessary
in
food,
and
at
the
time,
by
necessary
they
were
referring
to
pesticides,
or
that
are
unavoidable.
now,
in
the
fda's
view
it
could
regulate--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--no,
i
am
saying
the
first
clause
in
section
406,
it
is
intricate,
and
i
am
trying
to
refer
to--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--no,
from
where
it
begins,
"any
poisonous
or
deleterious
substance".
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that
is
right.
now,
if
it
is
unavoidable
or
necessary,
the
fda
believes
it
can
regulate
its
presence
either
by
proceeding
in
individual
cases
or
by
adopting
tolerances.
under
the
court
of
appeals
construction,
until
a
tolerance
is
in
effect,
the
food
is
automatically
adulterated,
so
that
there
is
never
a
need
for
the
secretary
to
refer
to
the
general
adulteration
standard
in
section
4o2(a)(1).
under
respondents'
construction,
they
have
said
that
the
general
adulteration
standard
in
section
402(a)(1)
serves
as
a
transitional
device.
in
other
words,
until
a
tolerance
is
adopted,
the
agency
can
rely
on
the
general
adulteration
standard.
but
all
the
respondents
have
done
is
delay
the
final
day
of
reckoning.
under
their
construction
of
the
act,
the
general
adulteration
standard
is
rendered
superfluous,
not
today,
and
not
when
the
statute
was
enacted,
but
it
is
rendered
superfluous
once
a
tolerance
is
adopted.
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
congress
intended
section
402(a)(1)
to
be
superfluous.
it
was
adopted
as
part
of
the
same
statute
that
adopted
section
406,
and
congress
endorsed
this
court's
construction
in
the
lexington
mill
case,
which
allowed
the
agency
to
prove
in
an
individual
case
that
food
yes
adulterated.
there
is
also
no
reason
for
congress
to
have
intended
this
to
operate
in
a
transitional
fashion
because
congress
was
not
dealing
with
a
licensing
scheme,
as
congress
has
in
later
statutes,
so
either
the
construction
adopted
by
the
respondents
or
the
one
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals
necessarily
renders
the
general
adulteration
standard
superfluous
for
these
types
of
substances,
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
or
the
background
or
the
purposes
that
suggest
that
was
the
reason
that
congress
intended
section
406
to
play.
what
emerges
from
the
legislative
history
is
that
congress
intended
to
provide
the
agency
with
alternative
mechanisms.
as
i
said,
congress
endorsed
this
court's
decision
in
lexington
mill
and
reincorporated
the
standard
in
the
new
general
adulteration
standard
that
this
court
had
considered
in
the
lexington
mill
case.
that
allows
the
agency
to
operate
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
at
the
same
time,
congress
adopted
section
406,
which
deals
with
the
promulgation
of
regulations.
congress
never
considered
the
presence
of
the
word
406
to
be
material.
different
bills
that
were
introduced
in
this
five-year
period
used
the
verb
"shall"
and
is
authorized
to
interchangeably,
but
every
committee
report
said
that
this
section
authorizes
the
agency
to
adopt
tolerances.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
402(a)(1)
does
deal
with
added
or
inherent
substances.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
but
it
is
clear
that
congress
intended
402(a)(1)
to
apply
to
added
substances,
and
to
have
some
effect
there.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
it
is
redundant
insofar--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--yes,
added
substances,
and--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--but
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
congres
intended
it
to
be--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--to
be
partially
redundant
in
this
respect.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
it
is
the
fda's
position
that
it
is
not
an
inherent
constituent
of
food
because
it
is
not
the
natural
product
of
the
genetic
code
of
whatever
is
the
food
that
is
at
issue.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
or
anything
that
would
be
added
either
by
man
or
nature
the
agency
has
construed
it
in
this
fashion.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
we
would
submit
that
it
doesn't
serve
solely
as
a
transitional
device.
congress
never
said
that
402(a)(1)
was
intended
to--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--unless
it
was
to
serve
solely
as
a
transitional
device,
it
would
be
superfluous,
because
the
tolerance
would
always
provide
you
with
an
answer
to
whether
a
food
was
adulterated.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
i
have
a
few
points
i
would
like
to
make.
first,
we
have
heard
a
great
deal
about
public
participation
being
the
purpose
that
the
act
was
adopted.
as
a
factual
matter,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
fda
will
receive
comments
from
parties
either
asking
to
have
tolerances
or
action
levels
set
or
changed,
and
therefore
if
respondents
want
to
have
some
input
in
the
process
they
need
only
apply
to
the
agency.
but
i
think
more
importantly,
since
the
question
is
what
congress
intended
in
1938,
and
since
the
legislative
history
makes
crystal
clear
that
the
public
congress
was
concerned
with
were
the
people
who
produce
food
at
that
point,
i
don't
think
respondents
can
reasonably
expect
to
place
a
contemporary
construction
on
a
rather
old
statute.
secondly,
respondents
argue
that
action
levels
are
the
equivalent
of
a
license
to
add
contaminants
to
food
or
to
market
contaminated
food,
and
that
is
just
flat
wrong.
action
levels
are
informal
prosecutorial
guidelines,
and
tolerances
are
regulations
having
the
force
and
effect
of
law.
the
two
are
materially
different,
and
respondents
have
attempted
to
equate
the
two
throughout
this
case.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
as
we
explained
at
page
45,
note
45
of
our
brief,
it
is
not
that
easy
to
change
tolerances.
once
we
tried
to
change
the
pcb
tolerance
in
food,
we
found
out
it
took
seven
years
to
do
it,
it
can't
be
done
as
easily
as
changing
an
action
level.
the
agency
in
'74,
when
there
was
ppb
contamination,
changed
its
action
level
in
a
relatively
brief
period
of
time.
changing
a
tolerance
in
order
to
respond
to
an
emergency
takes
a
drastically
longer
period.
i
would
also
like
to
say
that
respondents
have
attempted
to
prepare
the
regulatory
scheme
here
to
the
regulatory
scheme
for
color
additives,
food
additives,
and
drugs.
the
schemes
are
entirely
different.
if
you
want
to
market
a
food
with
a
food
additive,
you
have
to
prove
that
it
is
safe.
here
the
agency
has
to
prove
that
the
contaminant
will
result
in
some
injury
to
health.
the
burden
of
proof
is
in
an
entirely
different
place
in
the
two
different
types
of
postures.
and
finally,
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
agency
action
levels...
excuse
me...
agency
action
levels
are
published
in
the
federal
register.
they
have
been
since
the
agency's
regulations
were
adopted
in
1977,
so
anyone
can
learn
where
they
are,
and
the
last
point
is
that
we
don't
ask
the
court
to
say
that
the
house
amendment
to
the
bill
had
no
meaning.
all
you
have
to
do
is
read
the
house
report,
and
you
can
see
that
the
house
stated
quite
clearly
that
it
didn't
intend
this
change
to
have
any
substantive
effect.
the
house
reported
stated
that
it
authorized
the
agency.
it
also
stated
that
in
all
of
the
other
places.
thank
you
very
much.
