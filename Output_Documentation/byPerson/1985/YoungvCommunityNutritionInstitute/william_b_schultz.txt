mr.
william
b.
schultz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
raises
important
public
policy
issues
concerning
the
process
to
be
used
by
the
food
and
drug
administration
in
setting
a
standard
for
poisonous
and
deleterious
substances
which
are
unavoidable
and
which
are
added.
and
before
i
proceed
i
would
like
to
say
i
agree
with
you,
justice
o'connor,
that
it
is
not
immediately
apparent
that
aflatoxin
would
be
added,
but
it
is
very
clear
in
the
legislative
history
that
congres
intended
to
cover
substances
added
by
nature
as
well
as
those
added
by
man,
and
the
fda,
as
mr.
larkin
said,
consistently
construed
that
word
in
that
way.
for
example,
the
legislative
history
talks
about
lead,
which
can
get
into
the
environment,
and
describes
that
as
an
added
substance.
the
substances
that
we
are
concerned
with
here
are
substances
such
as
mercury
in
fish
and
aflatoxin
in
corn,
the
specific
substance
around
which
this
case
arose.
and
i
would
like
to
begin
by
responding
to
justice
white's
question,
which
is,
why
would
congress
have
wanted
to
intend,
wished
to
intend
that
fda
use
the
public
participation
and
rulemaking
processes
in
regulating
these
added
poisonous
and
deleterious
substances?
and
to
start,
i
would
like
to
talk
for
a
few
minutes,
one
minute
about
what
decision
it
is
that
the
fda
is
going
to
have
to
make
when
it
is
regulating
aflatoxin
or
another
one
of
these
substances.
essentially
it
is
a
two-part
decision.
in
the
first
instance
it
will
have
to
look
at
the
evidence
and
determine
how
dangerous
is
that
substance.
the
parties
here
agree
that
aflatoxin
is
an
extremely
potent
carcinogen,
but
obviously
one
of
the
issues
that
the
agency
would
have
to
look
at
is
exactly
how
potent.
the
second
issue
is
how
avoidable.
aflatoxin
occurs
in
a
mold
that
grows
on
corn,
but
the
mold
can
be
controlled
by
dampness
or
other
storage
conditions,
and
so
the
agency
would
want
to
look
obviously
and
see
whether
there
were
ways
to
limit
the
public
exposure
to
the
substance,
and
regardless
of
whether
the
fda
uses
the
action
levels
which
it
chooses
to
use
or
the
rulemaking
procedure
we
are
advocating,
it
is
going
to
have
to
decide
each
of
these
two
issues.
the
difference
is
that
public
participation
would
require
the
agency
to
do
several
things
that
we
regard
as
advantageous.
first,
it
would
have
to
marshall
the
evidence
and
inform
the
public
of
what
evidence
it
is
relying
on.
secondly,
it
would
have
to
allow
the
submission
of
additional
evidence
by
either
consumers
or
by
industry.
third,
it
would
have
to
hold
a
hearing
if
someone
requested
a
hearing
and
if
there
were
material
issues
of
fact,
and
fourth,
it
would
have
to
explain
the
reasons
for
its
decision
and
put
this
together
in
a
record
which
would
be
subject
to
judicial
review.
the
advantages
of
such
a
system
are
that
it
disciplines
the
agency
in
its
thought
process,
it
allows
for
more
information,
and
it
enhances
the
agency's
credibility.
our
contention
here
is--
mr.
william
b.
schultz
--i
don't
believe
we
need
to
presume
it.
what
our
contention
is
here
is,
not
only
is
public
participation
a
good
idea,
but--
mr.
william
b.
schultz
--that
is
precisely
the
issue.
the
issue
is
whether
in
section
406
congress
mandated
public
participation.
and
if
i
may,
what
i
would
like
to
do
before
i
get
to
the
issue
is
spend
a
few
minutes
talking
about
action
levels,
which
are
the
way,
the
device
that
the
agency
uses
now
to
regulate
these
substances,
so
we
can
see
the
contrast
between
what
the
agency
does
and
what
we
contend
congress
required
it
to
do.
the
fda's
use
of
action
levels,
and,
we
would
contend,
the
disadvantages
of
not
allowing
public
participation
can
be
seen
in
the
way
the
agency
regulates
aflatoxin.
in
1969,
it
set
the
action
level
for
aflatoxin
at
20
parts
per
billion,
and
it
did
that
simply
by
issuing
a
press
release
announcing
it
to
the
press.
it
gave
no
explanation
of
its
reasons.
it
created
no
record.
it
provided
no
opportunity
to
comment,
and
it
provided
the
public
with
no
way
of
determining
whether
the
agency
had
done
a
good
job.
three
times
in
recent
years
the
fda
has
granted
exceptions
to
those
action
levels
of
a
temporary
nature,
and
at
most
what
the
fda
has
done
to
provide
for
public
comment
is
after
the
fact
publish
its
decision
in
the
federal
register
and
invite
comments.
in
1983,
the
community
nutrition
institute
did
indeed
comment,
but
the
fda
never
even
responded.
it
is
our
contention
that
these
action
levels
in
most
respects
operate
like
a
tolerance
even
though
they
are
not
promulgated
through
the
tolerance
setting
procedures,
and
they
do
that
because
we
would
contend
they
act
really
as
a
license
to
the
industry,
and
they
are
the
fda's
approval
of
corn,
for
example,
as
long
as
it
contains
less
than
20
parts
per
billion
aflatoxin,
and
i
would
like
to
take
a
moment
and
cite
a
couple
of
the
places
in
the
record
to
demonstrate
this,
because
it
has
just
recently
become
an
issue
in
the
case.
the
first
place
is
in
the
answer
to
the
complaint.
the
complaint
in
paragraph
13
on
page
110
of
the
joint
appendix
alleges
fda
has
set
an
informal
action
level
which
is
an
administrative
determination
without
notice
and
comment
rulemaking
as
to
the
level
of
aflatoxin
contamination
below
which
no
regulatory
action
will
be
taken
against
the
product,
and
the
agency
admitted
that
contention
in
its
answer
at
page
125.
in
addition,
each
of
the
times
the
fda
has
granted
these
exemptions,
at
page
104,
118,
and
227
of
the
joint
appendix,
it
has
said
something
like
it
said
in
1983
or
similar
language,
and
that
language
is,
the
fda
will
not
object
to
the
shipment
of
corn
containing
between
20
parts
per
billion
and
100
parts
per
billion
aflatoxin.
that
is
on
page
227
of
the
joint
appendix.
additional
authorities
are
cited
at
pages
8
and
9
of
our
brief,
and
i
guess
the
final
authority
would
be
the
fda's
actual
practice.
it
has
never
prosecuted
a
company
who
has
complied
with
one
of
its
action
levels,
and
at
least
in
my
mind
it
is
hard
to
believe
such
a
prosecution
could
be
successful.
i
would
like
to
now
turn
to
the
statute,
because
i
regard
the
key
flaw
in
the
government's
argument
to
be
the
fact
that
it
simply
doesn't
talk
about
the
actual
language
of
the
statute.
section
406,
which
is
the
statutory
provision
at
issue,
covers
a
substance
which
meets
a
three-part
test.
it
must
be
poisonous
and
deleterious;
it
must
be
added;
and
it
must
be
unavoidable.
there
is
no
doubt
that
aflatoxin
qualifies
under
all
three
of
those
parts.
and
so
the
issue
turns
around
later
language
of
the
statute
which
says
in
section
406,
"if
such
substance
is
unavoidable,
the
secretary
shall
promulgate
regulations.
"
now,
there
is
other
language
in
the
statute
that
the
government
relies
on,
and
i
would
like
to
talk
about
that
in
a
minute,
but
for
the
moment
i
would
like
to
focus
on
the
words,
"the
secretary
shall
promulgate
regulations".
it
is
clear
under
the
statutory
scheme
that
if
the
statute
requires
the
secretary
to
promulgate
those
regulations,
they
must
be
issued
in
compliance
with
the
rulemaking
procedures
contained
in
section
701(e)
of
the
statute.
and
we
regard
at
least
this
language
taken
by
itself
as
dispositive
of
congress's
intent
and
as
dispositive
of
the
issue
as
to
whether
the
secretary
is
indeed
required
to
issue
those
regulations.
the
agency
relies
on
language
which
appears
later
in
the
statute
to
argue
that
the
secretary
has
discretion
as
to
whether...
to
use
section
406,
and
that
language
is
as
follows.
the
statute
says,
"the
secretary
shall
promulgate
regulations
limiting
the
quantity
therein
or
thereon
to
such
extent
as
he
finds
necessary
for
the
protection
of
the
public
health.
"
"the
agency
says
the
words.
"
to
such
extent
as
he
finds
necessary
for
the
protection
of
the
public
health
"modifies
the
word"
shall,
"and
that
the
secretary
need
only
use
section
406
when
he
deems
it
necessary.
"
as
the
court
of
appeals
explained
in
its
opinion,
probably
better
than
i
can,
the
problem
with
this
argument
is
that
it
is
not
consistent
with
the
structure
of
the
sentence.
the
better
reading
of
the
sentence
is
that
the
words
were
intended
to
describe
the
standard.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
that
would
certainly
be
my
position.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
yes.
i
was
trying
not
to
be
too
extreme--
0
[generallaughter.]
--but
my
position
would
be,
the
plain
reading
of
the
statute
is
that
the
secretary
was
required
to
issue
the
regulation,
and
that
those
words
were
intended
to
tell
the
fda
the
standard
it
was
to
employ.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
well,
i
suppose
i
look
at
the
history
a
little
bit
differently
than
they
do.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
i
meant
their
practice.
no,
i
look
at
the
language
very
differently
than
they
do.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
i
think
it
is
stretching
the
language
to
a
very
large
degree,
and
i
think
you
can
see
that
if
you
look
at
another
section
of
the
statute,
section
401,
which
congress
adopted
in
the
same
statute
in
1938,
because
there--
mr.
william
b.
schultz
--well,
that
is
why
i
was
saying
i
regard
the
fda's
actual
practice
a
little
differently
than
they
do.
they
set
out
to
issue
these
regulations
after
the
statute
was
passed.
they
in
fact
issued
one.
the
war
intervened,
which
is
a
time
when
they
did
very
little,
and
then
in
the
late
1940s
they
were
engaged
in
a
proceeding
to
issue
100
tolerances
under
section
406
for
pesticides,
and
they
found
that
they
felt
the
statute
was
too
cumbersome
for
them
to
use
it
for
pesticides,
and
so
what
the
agency
did
is,
it
went
to
congress
and
said,
this
is
unworkable,
we
need
legislative
change.
and
in
1953
congress
adopted
the
pesticide
amendments,
taking
pesticides
out
of
section
406.
now,
we
would
say
that
if
in
fact
the
fda
had
thought
for
all
these
years
that
it
wasn't
required
to
use
section
406,
and
that
it
had
all
this
discretion,
it
would
have
never
needed
to
go
to
congress
in
the
early
1950s.
it
could
have
simply
used
action
levels
or
some
other
procedures
other
than
those
required
by
the
statute.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
they
actually
used
action
levels
even
before
1938,
so
that
was--
mr.
william
b.
schultz
--no,
what
we
would
say
is,
the
statute
plainly
requires
the
fda
to
issue
tolerances,
but
that
until
it
has
done
so,
it
may
bring
case-by-case
enforcement
action
under
section
402(a)(1),
the
general
adulteration
provision,
and
so
the
congress
provided
a
comprehensive
scheme
that
really
provides
for
both,
and
the
problem
here
is
not
so
much
the
use
of
action
levels,
but
the
use
of
action
levels
in
place
of
the
tolerances
that
congress,
we
think,
plainly
required.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
two,
one
in
1944
and
one
in
the
1970s.
only
two
times.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
yes.
and
i
think
they
have
made
it
pretty
clear
in
this
case
and
before
this
case
that
they
don't
intend
to
use
section
406
because
they
don't
believe
they
have
to
use
it.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
well,
that
is
hard
to
say,
justice
white.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
well,
in
1977
they
issued
a
final
rule
setting
out
their
practice
for
action
levels
and
tolerances,
and
if
you
read
that
rule
you
would
think
that
they
in
fact
intended
to
use
tolerances
when
the
evidence
was
static,
and
in
fact
they
began
a
proceeding
to
issue
a
tolerance
for
aflatoxin
in
peanuts.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
one
thing
that
i
think
was
clear
certainly
by
the
1970s
is
that
they
read
these
sections
as
discretionary,
and
that
they
didn't
believe
they
had
to
issue
tolerances.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
i
think
it
may
have
been.
it
is
not
discussed
anywhere,
but
if
somebody
had
looked
at
their
nonaction--
mr.
william
b.
schultz
--well,
yes,
they
do
say
that,
but
if
you
go
and
look
at
the
testimony
they
are
talking
about,
in
each
case
the
testimony
says
section
406
authorizes
the
fda
to
issue
action
levels.
well,
that
is
true.
it
does.
we
agree.
section
406
authorizes
the
fda
to
do
this.
they
never
testified
that
in
our
view
we
are
not--
mr.
william
b.
schultz
--excuse
me,
tolerances.
thank
you.
they
never
testified
that
in
our
view
section
406
also
would
allow
us
to
regulate
substances
either
through
action
levels
or
tolerances.
they
merely
talked
in
terms
of
their
authority.
they
never
talked
in
terms
of
what
their
interpretation
of
the
word
401
of
the
statute,
which
was
passed
at
the
same
time,
where
congress
used
the
same
word,
"shall"
but
it
gave
the
secretary
discretion
by
putting
the
qualifying
phrase
right
before
the
word
"shall".
so,
what
section
401
says
is,
when
in
the
judgment
of
the
secretary
such
action
will
promote
honesty
and
fair
dealing
in
the
interest
of
consumers,
he
shall
promulgate
regulations
in
that
case
concerning
standards
of
identify
for
food.
well,
then,
congress
gave
the
secretary
discretion,
and
if
it
had
wished
to
do
so
here,
i
think
it
can
be
assumed
that
it
would
have
put
the
qualifying
language
next
to
the
word
"shall".
mr.
william
b.
schultz
i
agree
with
part
of
the
argument,
but
i
believe
it
is
overstated.
let
me
tell
you
why.
i
would
agree
that
the
fda
does
have
somewhat
less
flexibility,
but
i
would
argue
that
congress
gave
them
sufficient
flexibility
to
act
when
they
need
it,
and
essentially
if
the
fda
had
a
tolerance
here
and
there
and
there
were
an
emergency,
they
could
reduce
the
tolerance
on
an
expedited
basis,
and
indeed
in
section
701(e),
there
is
a
provision
that
says
the
fda...
there
is
a
general
provision
in
701(e)
that
allows
90
days
before
a
final
order
goes
into
effect,
but
in
the
case
of
an
emergency
situation
the
fda
can
exempt
itself
from
that
provision.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
nothing,
your
honor.
justice
white,
the
fda
would
have
to
go
through
the
procedure,
but
it--
mr.
william
b.
schultz
--yes.
the
fda
has
only
lowered--
mr.
william
b.
schultz
--subject
to
judicial
review,
but
the
agency's
decision
would
be
effective
prior
to
judicial
review.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
that
would
be
up
to
the
court,
but
there
certainly
is
authority
in
the
statute
to
make
the
agency's
decision
effective
immediately
at
the
time
it
is
rendered.
i
think
it
is
relevant
that
the
fda
has
only
lowered
an
action
level
once.
the
example
is
cited
in
the
government's
reply
brief,
and
in
that
case
it
took
six
months
to
lower
the
action
level,
and
what
we
would
contend
is
that
under
the
procedures
congress
gave
it
it
could
act
at
least
that
quickly
or
even
more
quickly.
mr.
william

the
one
time
the
fda
has
done
it,
it
did,
but
that
was
not
an
emergency
situation.
but
i
think
it
took
much
longer
than
it
should
have,
but
i
would
agree
that
normally
it
would
be
expected
to
take
months
to
go
through
the
procedure,
but
we
would
say
that
that
is
the
choice
that
congress
made,
and
in
fact
the
legislative
history
demonstrates
the
choice
was
not
inadvertent.

1938,
when
it
issued
section
406.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
no.
they
had
heard
of
some
of
them.
lead,
for
example,
there
is
an
action
level
on
lead.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
yes,
but
in
1938
there
were
over
100
substances
that
came
under
the
statute.
today
there
are
only
eight,
according
to
the
fda,
so
i
don't
think
they
can
credibly
argue
that
the
burden
today
is
greater
than
it
was
in
1938.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
it
hadn't
been
adopted,
but
that
is
why
when
congress
wanted
public
participation
it
adopted
the
specific
procedures
in
section
701.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
at
the
same
time,
in
1938.
and
701
lists
the
number
of
sections
in
the
statute
where
the
agency
is
required
to
go
through
rulemaking,
and
one
of
those
sections
is
indeed
section
406.
i
think--
mr.
william
b.
schultz
--i
agree
with
that.
our
interpretation
of
the
statute,
i
think,
is
shown
by
what
happened
with
aflatoxin.
it
was
discovered
in
the
early
1960s.
at
that
time
the
fda
could
immediately
issue
an
action
level,
but
in
our
view
it
was
also
required
to
begin
the
process
of
setting
a
tolerance,
and
then
once
the
tolerance
is
in
effect,
the
tolerance
would
replace
the
action
level.
congress
initially
drafted
the
bill
to
authorize
the
secretary
to
use
regulations.
the
bill
that
was
adopted
by
the
senate,
instead
of
saying
"shall",
said
the
secretary
is
authorized
to
issue
regulations.
that
is
the
reason
that
so
much
of
the
legislative
history
talks
in
terns
of
authority.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
yes.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
that's
correct,
and--
mr.
william
b.
schultz
--the
problem
is
that
there
is
a
specific
provision
in
section
406,
it
is
the
middle
sentence,
that
says,
"while
the
tolerance
is
in
effect,
that
general
adulteration
provision
does
not
apply.
"
so
the
tolerance
would
have
to
be
revoked.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
they
become
less
flexible
than
with
an
action
level,
but
this
is
the
same
procedure
that
congress
has
adopted
for
a
variety
of
substances
that
the
fda
licenses,
drugs,
food
additives,
color
additives,
animal
drugs.
if
we
focus
on
food
additives
and
color
additives,
in
each
of
those
cases
the
fda
is
required
to
consider
applications
for
licensing.
there
is
a
hearing
procedure.
once
the
license
is
granted,
it
is
good
until
revoked,
and
there
is
the
same
opportunity
for
a
hearing
before
it
is
revoked,
so
while
it
is
true
that
congress
gave
the
agency
less
flexibility
in
all
those
cases,
we
don't
regard
that
as
a
reason
for
interpreting
the
word
"shall"
to
mean
that.
it
is
perfectly
consistent
with
what
congress
would
have
intended.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
it
is
unclear.
i
think
it
probably
came
from
both.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
no,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
up
to
now
the
industry
is
satisfied
with
the
way
the
fda
is
regulated.
it
could
be
that
some
time
in
the
future
the
agency
will
revoke
its
action
levels,
and
there
would
be
a
lot
of
uncertainty
that
could
make
the
industry
very
uncomfortable,
and
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
congress
chose
the
tolerance
setting
procedure,
to
put
some
certainty
into
this
whole
process.
in
deciding
whether
congress
thought
about
this
or
not
and
what
it
intended,
we
regard
it
as
relevant
that
the
words
406,
but
in
four
other
places
in
the
statute.
and
in
order
to
adopt
the
fda's
argument,
you
essentially
have
to
disregard
that
change
and
assume
it
was
meaningless,
because
the
fda
argues
that
the
statute
ought
to
be
interpreted
as
though
the
house
never
changed
the
language
of
the
statute.
in
summary,
the
plain
meaning
of
section
406
requires
public
participation.
we
believe
it
is
apparent
that
that
requirement
was
not
inadvertent
on
the
part
of
congress.
under
the
cases
in
this
court,
in
order
to
disregard
the
plain
meaning,
the
fda
would
have
to
demonstrate
that
the
result
that
follows
was
absurd,
to
use
the
court's
word,
and
here
it
is
not
an
absurd
result.
it
makes
sense
that
it
is
a
result
congress
intended,
because
indeed
congress
has
required
hearings
in
order
to
revoke
approvals
for
drugs,
food
additives,
color
additives,
and
a
variety
of
substances
regulated
under
the
act.
finally,
public
participation
will
result
in
better
and
more
informed
decisions
by
the
fda.
it
has
all
the
advantages
which
have
been
identified
over
the
past
40
years
by
this
court
and
by
congress
in
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
the
food,
drug,
and
cosmetic
act.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
i
didn't
say
it.
one
of
the
problems
with
this
whole
process
is,
there
is
no
way
of
knowing
the
answers
to
some
of
these
questions,
because
there
is
no
public
record.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
the
agency
has
recently
adopted
a
practice
of
publishing
action
levels,
but
in
the
past
it
didn't
even
do
it
in
one
place.
it
simply
issued
press
releases.
in
the
case--
mr.
william
b.
schultz
--in
the
case
of
aflatoxin,
when
the
fda
is
granted
an
exemption,
it
did
it
at
the
request
of
the
industry,
so
the
industry
knew
they
were
considering
it,
but
no
one
else
did
unless
they
heard
it
through
the
grapevine.
there
is
no
formal
process
or
even
practice
by
the
fda
of
telling
the
public
they
are
considering
changing
an
action
level.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
amicus
briefs
saying
that
that
was
unacceptable?
mr.
william
b.
schultz
well,
i
think
they
are
in
agreement
with
the
action
level.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
but
part
of
the
problem
is
the
rest
of
the
public
has
been
excluded
from
participation,
and
there
is,
you
know,
we
still
don't
have
the
advantage
of
an
explanation
by
the
fda...
let
me
answer
the
question
this
way.
it
may
be
that
in
some
of
these
cases
the
agency
chose
the
same
action
level
that
it
would
choose
for
a
tolerance,
but
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
that
because
we
don't
know
the
evidence
the
agency
relied
on,
and
we
don't
know
its
reasons,
and
the
result
that
we
are
advocating
in
this
case
would
provide
us
with
the
kind
of
record
that
agencies
routinely
provide
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
so
that
those
judgments
could
in
fact
be
made.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
no,
but--
mr.
william
b.
schultz
--well,
we
have
to
do
it
in
hundreds
of
cases
all
around
the
country,
i
suppose,
is
part
of
the
problem,
and--
mr.
william
b.
schultz
--well,
if
the
tolerance
are
adopted,
the--
mr.
william
b.
schultz
--that
is
true.
the
fda
has
to
bring
a
lot
of
cases
around
the
country,
and
one
of
the
advantages
of
a
tolerance
is
that
once
you
go
through
all
this
work,
you
have
got
a
number,
20
parts
per
billion,
that
you
can
take
into
court,
and
as
justice
stevens
pointed
out,
the
only
issue
in
the
case
is
whether
the
company
has
exceeded
the
tolerance.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
so
in
that
sense
the
tolerance
is
far
more
efficient--
mr.
william
b.
schultz
--than
the
procedure
that
the
fda
has
chosen.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
thank
you.
