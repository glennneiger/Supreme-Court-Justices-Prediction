justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
could
do
both.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
it
did
the
latter,
adopt
the
tolerances,
it
couldn't
proceed
in
order
to...
it
couldn't
in
a
specific
case
insist
on
a
lower
tolerance?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
pending
the
setting
of
a
tolerance,
they
could
proceed
on
a
case-by-case
basis?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
by
these
so-called...
what
do
you
call
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
action,
they
could
proceed
on
that
until
a
tolerance
is
adopted.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
their
published--
justice
byron
r.
white
--everybody
knows
about
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
a
manufacturer
relies
on
one,
it
isn't
going
to
do
then
much
good
if
you
in
an
individual
case
don't
adhere
to
your
action
level.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
may
not
want
to,
but
suppose
the
prosecutor,
he
couldn't
defend
on
the
basis
that
he
is
in
compliance
with
the
action
level.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
could
just
sue
and
say
this
is
a
new
action
level.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
couldn't
do
that
if
a
tolerance
had
been--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
the
only
one
you...
that
is
the
only
tolerance
level
there
is,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
many
substances
are
there
really
that
might
be
the
subject
of
a
tolerance
level?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
you
went
at
it
by
the
business
of
setting
tolerances,
you
would
have
had
to
set
21
tolerances?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
meanwhile,
while
you
were
setting
them,
you
could
have
your
action
level.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know.
of
course,
it
is
a
question
of
statutory
construction
whether
congress
told
you--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
in
the
process
you
will
explain
why
congress
thought...
ever
required
tolerances,
or
ever
provided
for
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
decided
otherwise
later.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
must
say,
if
you
just
read
it
on
its
face,
you
would
think
that
shall
meant
something.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
would
hardly
draft
it
that
way
today.
that
isn't
the
best
way
of
expressing
the
government's
position.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
you
lose
one
case,
you
will
probably
bring
another,
hoping
to
be
able
to
prove
it
in
that
way.
you
are
not
about
to
change
your
action
level
as
a
result
of
one
case,
i
don't
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
you
said
that
about
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
but
i
didn't
find
that
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion.
justice
byron
r.
white
one
more...
there
is
no
redundancy...
even
if
you
had
to
adopt
tolerances,
402
wouldn't
be
redundant
because
you
would
resort
to
it
to
control
a
situation
until
the
tolerance
was
adopted.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
said
it
would
be
redundant,
though,
which
it
certainly
wouldn't
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
you
have
to
say
the
only
reading
of
the
statute,
the
only
sensible,
rational
reading?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
just
the
better.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
fda
has
read
that
language,
has
thought
forever
that
that
section
would
bear
a
construction
different
from
yours,
and
you
say
just
no
rational
person
could
possibly
read
that
language
the
way
the
fda
has
for
50
years?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
history?
how
about
the
language?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
was
the
first
time
they
ever
resorted
to
action
levels?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
your
position
then,
i
take
it,
that
it
just
couldn't
directly
bring
an
enforcement
action
absent
a
tolerance?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
many
tolerances
has
the
fda
actually
issued
under
406?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
is
the
very
last
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
when
did
it
first
become
clear
that
the
agency
wasn't
about
to
regularly
issue
tolerances?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
forties?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
also
was
perfectly
clear
that
where
that
wasn't
so,
they
weren't
about
to
issue
tolerances.
justice
byron
r.
white
wasn't
it
clear
before
that
time
that
that
was
their
view?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
is
discussed
here.
that
has
been
their
view
since
the
beginning.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
what
exempts
it
from
going
through
the
regular
procedure
for
amending
a
regulation?
justice
byron
r.
white
calling
for
comment,
publication,
putting
out
a
proposal,
going
through
their
regular
administrative
procedure.
justice
byron
r.
white
subject
to
judicial
review.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
not
necessarily.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
choice
was...
when
was
the
congressional
choice
that
you
claim
was
made,
about
when?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
had
never
of
a
lot
of
these
substances
at
that
time,
had
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
isn't
there
an
awful
lot
being
learned
about
some
of
these
substances
that
was
never
known
before?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there
is
a
new
substance
provided
obviously
they
can
use
action
levels
or
direct
enforcement
until
there
is
a
tolerance
established.
you
agree
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
secretary
under
your
view,
the
secretary
is
supposed
to
establish
a
tolerance.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
until...
and
he
is
supposed
to
get
started,
but
until
then
he
can
prevent
by
action
level
or
just
by
direct
enforcement
the
sale
of
what
he
calls
adulterated
foods.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
couldn't
he,
if
he
had
issued
a
regulation,
why
couldn't
he
then
by
the
sane
token
say,
i
want
to
amend
this
regulation,
i
have
discovered
some
things
i
don't
want
to,
and
until
i
amend
this
regulation
i
can
use
a
different
action
level?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
really
is...
things
become
rather
inflexible
when
a
tolerance
is
adopted.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
often...
perhaps
you
have
already
said
it.
how
often
are
action
levels
changed?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
the
action
levels
were
published.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
anybody
know
when
they
are
about
to
change
an
action
level
or
are
considering
changing
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
to
make
an
action
level...
to
enforce
an
action
level,
they
have
to
enforce.
they
have
to
go
to
court,
and
then
they
have
to
prove
that
a
food
is
unsafe
and
adulterated.
i
would
suppose
there
would
be
more
amicus
briefs
in
a
case
like
that
than
you
could
count.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
unless
the
entire
industry
was
in
agreement
with
the
action
level,
i
would
suppose
they
would
say
so.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
one
way
of
public
participation.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
your
client
wouldn't
be
excluded
from
any...
from
an
amicus
position
in
an
enforcement
action,
would
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
could
get
your
licks
in
somewhere.
justice
byron
r.
white
just
like
the
fda
would.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
a
tolerance
is
a
different
matter.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
