or
dues
increases?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
still
a
dissent.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
the
board's
calculations,
this
particular
change
is
not
one
that
requires
a
board
conducted
election,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
board
is
saying
that
if
the
union
is
going
to
hold
an
election
it
should
let
other
people
vote?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
isn't
one
of
the
changes...
this
affiliation
wouldn't,
under
the
board's
criteria,
wouldn't
precipitate
a
new
certification
election?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
isn't
what
the
board
says.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
would
be
satisfied
with
a
union
election.
justice
byron
r.
white
through
certification?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the...
all
board
lawmaking,
they
don't
make
it
by
regulation,
do
they?
they
make
it
by
adjudication.
justice
byron
r.
white
--the
evidence
of
their
policy
is
this
particular
adjudication?
justice
byron
r.
white
except
affiliation?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
board
seems
to
agree
that
this
isn't
a
recertification
issue
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
statute
says
you
can
have
board
supervised
elections
when
you
certify
or
recertify?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
the
board
says
this
is
not
a
recertification.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
yet,
it
refuses
to...
it
requires
something
short
of
a
recertification?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
does
it
get
us
authority
to
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
derive
it
from
the
certification
section?
justice
byron
r.
white
sort
of
a
prophylactic
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
that
theory
the
board
could
do
almost
anything
that
was
reasonable,
or
even--
justice
byron
r.
white
--so,
would
you
have
been
arguing
before
'78
or
'77
that
the
board's
rule--
justice
byron
r.
white
--sounds
as
though
you
would,
although
i
think
on
your
own,
based
on
your
own
argument,
you'd
have
to
say
either
construction
of
the
act
is--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
gold,
you
have
to
show,
don't
you,
that
this
rule
is
contrary
to
the
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
your
submission
is
not
that
this
is
contrary
to
the
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is?
are
you
going
to
argue
that
the
act--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
gold,
in
practical
terms
what
the
union
came
to
the
board
for
was
to
change
its
name,
change
the
name
of
the
certified
union,
and
the
board
said,
no,
we
won't.
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
they
said,
unless
you
have
an
election
we
won't
change
your
name?
so,
suppose
the
union
just
doesn't
have
an
election
and...
can
it
retain
its
old
name?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
certification?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
the
employer...
did
the
board
say
they
won't
change
their
name
and
therefore
said
that
the
employer
doesn't
have
to
bargain?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
union
comes
to
them
and
says,
look,
we're
the
same
old
union,
here's
our
name,
now
bargain
with
us.
would
the
employer
have
to
do
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
because,
as
a
legal
matter
you
are
now
part
of
a
larger
unit?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
what's
involved
here
is
a
duty
to
bargain
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
this
case
the
board
has
not
said
that,
the
result
of
this
is,
if
you
don't
hold
your
own
election
we
will?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
just
says
that
the
employer
just
needn't
bargain?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
then
the
union
would
have
to
petition
for
an
election?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
that
you
must
argue
then
that...
suppose
the
union
held
this
kind
of
an
election
and
the
majority
voted
against
the
affiliation.
i
suppose
you
would
say
the
board
still
isn't...
shouldn't
be
permitted
to
let
the
employer
refuse
to
bargain?
it
either
should
be
a
decertification
election
or
nothing?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
exactly,
but
as
long
as
it
says
that
this
affiliation
isn't
really
very
fundamental,
not
in
itself
enough
to
hold
an
election?
