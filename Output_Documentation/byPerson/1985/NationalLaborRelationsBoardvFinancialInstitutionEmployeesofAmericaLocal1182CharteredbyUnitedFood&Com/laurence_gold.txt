mr.
laurence
gold
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
at
the
outset
to
note
two
aspects
of
this
case.
first
of
all,
the
board's
present
rule
applies
only
where
there
is
a
change
in
the
organizational
structure
of
a
certified
bargaining
representative
that
in
the
board's
judgment
is
not
sufficient
to
destroy
the
continuity
of
the
selected
representative.
this
is
not
a
situation
in
which
the
board
has
determined
that
organization
"a"
no
longer
exists
and
that
organization
"b"
has
come
into
being.
rather,
the
board's
premise
and
the
very
reason
it
has
determined
that
its
representation
procedures
as
stated
in
section
9
of
the
act
are
not
applicable
is
that
there
is
one
organization
and
only
one
organization,
an
organization
which
has
stood
the
test
of
a
representation
election
and
which
continues.
secondly,
this
is
not
a
situation
in
which
the
union's
interest
is
to
secure
from
the
board
some
official
recognition
of
its
affiliation
of
its
name
change.
this
is
a
situation
in
which
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
the
employer
as
the
act
states
is
to
be
required
to
continue
to
recognize
a
continuing
organization
which
has
been
selected
by
the
employees.
the
scheme
of
the
act
is
not
one
which
provides
for
regular
and
periodic
tests
of
employee
sentiment
whenever
the
employer
wishes
to
have
that
test.
rather,
the
system
is
that
where
a
union
claims
to
be
the
representative
of
a
group
of
presently
unrepresented
employees,
the
union
can
seek
a
board
election
or
the
employer,
if
the
union
asks
the
employer
to
recognize
the
organization,
can
seek
a
board
election
and
the
board,
using
public
resources,
thereupon
conducts
an
election.
that
election's
effects
continue
in
force
unless
one
of
two
circumstances
obtains.
the
first
circumstance
is
that
a
group
of
the
represented
employees
go
to
the
labor
board
as
they
have
a
right
to
do
under
section
9-c-1-a
and
say,
we
do
not
wish
to
be
represented
by
this
organization,
and
if
certain
requisites,
a
sufficient
number
of
employees,
less
than
the
majority,
i
would
add,
make
such
a
request
then
the
board
will
hold
what
is
called
a
decertification
election
and
the
employees
at
that
point
can
of
their
own
initiative
and
volition
reject
the
continuing
effects
of
this
first
publicly
held
board
election.
or,
secondly,
the
board
has
held
that
where
an
employer
has
objective
evidence
that
a
majority
no
longer
support
the
organization
that
was
selected,
the
employer
can
precipitate
a
test
of
either...
of
the
correctness
of
its
view
or
another
election
by
refusing
to
bargain.
mr.
laurence
gold
no,
i
don't
agree
that
any
of
the
points
about
the
system
that
i've
stated
evolved
by
board
decision.
obviously
there's
been
board
elaboration
but
each
of
the
points
i've
made
are
those
stated
in
the
act.
there
is
a
section
9
and
there
is
a
section
9-c-1
and
the
system
for
determining
what
the
prerequisites
are
for
the
employer
having
to
recognize
the
union
are
stated
there.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
that
is
board
evolved,
and
there
is
no
question
here,
either
concerning
a
rule
the
board
has
issued
or
in
this
particular
case,
about
the
contract
bar.
the
contract
bar
rule
applies
only
where
the
employees
seek
a
redetermination.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes.
mr.
laurence
gold
no,
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
the
test
of
irrationality.
i
do
believe
that
the
board's
decision
here
is
irrational
in
the
most
basic
sense
and
in
these
terms.
its
premise
is
based
on
two
irreconcilable
proposition.
proposition
no.
1
is
that
there
is
one
organization
which
continues.
proposition
no.
2
is
that
an
affiliation
decision
concerns
the
selection
of
a
new
representative
and
that
the
board
either
on
a
prophylactic
basis
or
some
other
basis
they
want
to
make
up
can
therefore
regulate
that
decision.
and
in
strict
terms
of
logic,
or
not
even
very
strict
terms,
in
the
most
basic
terms
of
logic,
you
can't
have
both
that
premise
and
that
conclusion.
mr.
laurence
gold
i
think
i
have
to
show
one
of
two
things
as
i
understand
the
law
in
this
court.
i
have
to
show
either
that
the
decision
is
irrational
and
unreasoned
or
that
it
is
contrary
to
the
act.
in
a
case
like
metropolitan
life,
in--
mr.
laurence
gold
--it's
both.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes.
i
had
started
to
argue
why
i
thought
it
was
inconsistent
with
the
act
but
justice
rehnquist
very
fairly
asked
whether
i
was
arguing
that
the
decision
is
irrational
without
getting
into
any
of
the
larger
questions.
we
do
argue,
and
we
emphasize
that
in
our
judgment
this
decision
is
irrational
in
this
basic
sense,
that
its
premises
are
mutually
inconsistent,
and
therefore
at
the
very
least
the
matter
has
to
go
back
to
the
board.
i
would
like
to
in
that
respect
attempt
to
elaborate
a
bit
on
the
questions
that
justice
o'connor
raised
because
the
board,
while
saying
that
there
is
one
organization
here
which
has
continuity,
has
based
its
right
to
regulate
on
two
propositions.
the
first
is
that
even
though
there's
one
entity
and
it
has
been
selected
and
it
continues,
affiliation
decisions
involve,
quote,
"the
selection
of
a
bargaining
representative.
"
of
a
new
bargaining
representative.
that,
as
i
attempted
to
say
to
justice
rehnquist,
seems
to
as
to
be
totally
irrational.
you
can't
say
those
two
things
at
the
same
time.
secondly,
the
board
says,
but
even
if
this
isn't
a
question
concerning
the
selection
of
a
new
bargaining
representative
or
a
different
bargaining
representative,
it
is
a
decision
that,
quote,
"significantly
affects
the
union's
representation
of
the
bargaining
unit.
"
that
in
our
judgment
is
not
open
to
attack
on
the
ground
that
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
board's
major
premise,
namely
that
there
is
continuity.
but
it's
inconsistent
with
the
background
i
was
attempting
to
spell
out.
the
national
labor
relation
board
is
an
extremely
important
agency
which
as
a
central
role
of
labor-management
relations.
but
congress
in
its
wisdom
has
not
given
the
labor
board
the
authority
to
regulate
everything
having
to
do
with
labor-management
relations.
rather,
congress
has
made
the
judgment,
and
we
spell
this
out
in
detail
in
part
2
of
our
brief,
and
this
court
has
grappled
with
this
issue
a
number
of
times,
that
once
the
representative
is
selected,
the
members
will
control
the
organization
and
that
you
have
to
be
a
member
to
have
the
rights
within
the
organization
to
control
its
destiny.
the
union
cannot
force
you,
as
this
court
said
last
term,
even
once
you've
joined,
to
stay
in
the
union.
the
union
cannot
do
anything
once
it
is
selected
as
the
representative
to
imperil
your
job
rights
or
to
otherwise
interfere
with
your
rights
as
an
employee,
but
the
individual
who
chooses
not
to
join
and
be
an
active
member
does
not
have
a
voice
in
the
union.
that
being
so,
and
given
the
nature
of
organizations,
the
proposition
that
the
labor
board
can
give
non-members
a
voice
on
any
union
decision
that,
quote,
"significantly
effects
the
union's
representation
of
the
bargaining
unit.
"
destroys
the
logic
of
the
act.
the
union
is
going
to
be
faced
with
one
decision
after
another.
who
will
be
the
officers?
you
might
have
had
someone
in
as
an
officer
in
the
first
term
of
the
union's
existence
who
believed
that
the
best
way
to
approach
the
employer
was
to
get
along
with
him.
that
individual
may
run
for
union
office
and
be
defeated
by
someone
else
who
takes
a
completely
different
view
of
how
the
union
ought
to
approach
the
employer,
far
more
militantly.
certainly
that
is
a
decision
that
significantly
affects
the
union's
representation
of
the
bargaining
unit,
or
i
could
use
any
of
the
other
examples
that
have
already
been
raised.
the
union
changes
its
constitution
to
permit
the
executive
board
to
call
a
strike
rather
than
have
a
membership
vote,
or
the
other
way
around,
or
the
union
determines
to
organize
a
new
bargaining
unit
which
will
change
the
balance
of
power
within
the
union
with
regard
to
all
the
further
internal
decisions.
mr.
laurence
gold
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
laurence
gold
that
is
part
of...
the
board
has
taken
that
action
as
part
of
its
method
for
running
representation
elections.
whether
it's
subject
to
attack
in
those
terms
is
a
different
question.
mr.
laurence
gold
i
don't
believe
so.
i
take
it
that
we
would
have
a
completely
different
case
if
the
board
were
to
determine
that
whenever
a
certain
change
occurs,
the
union
will
no
longer
be
regarded
as
the
organization
that
was
selected
and
there
will
be
a
second
representation
election.
then
the
board
would
be
acting
within
its
jurisdiction,
and
the
question
here
would
be
whether
or
not
its
determination
were
right
or
wrong.
it
seems
to
me
you'd
have
many
of
the
same
problems
in
such
an
instance
in
terms
of
congress's
determination
to
leave
the
conduct
of
the
organization
to
itself,
because
you
would
get
into
the
question,
suppose
the
board
were
to
say
it
would
be
regarded
as
the
organization
that
was
selected
and
there
will
be
a
second
representation
election.
it
seems
to
me
you'd
have
many
of
the
same
problems
in
such
an
instance
in
terms
of
congress's
determination
to
leave
the
conduct
of
the
organization
to
itself
because
you
would
get
into
the
question,
suppose
the
board
were
to
say
that
every
time
there
is
an
election
that
as
mandated
by
the
landrum-griffin
act
which
requires
periodic
election
of
officers,
that
changed
the
organization
and
the
employer
can
refuse
to
bargain.
that's
what
we're
really
talking
about
here.
when
can
the
employer,
rather
than
the
employees,
end
the
effect
of
this
first
representation
election?
there
is
no
question
raised
by
this
case
concerning
the
right
of
the
employees,
if
they
don't
like
the
way
the
union
and
its
members
are
evolving
the
organization,
to
go
to
the
labor
board.
justice
rehnquist
asked
about
the
contract
bar
rule.
well,
that
just
isn't
present
here.
what
the
board
does
to
the
contract
bar
rule,
when
employees
can
secure
a
second
board
election,
is
not
at
issue
here.
it's
the
employer,
even
though
he
didn't
have
any
evidence
or
employee
dissatisfaction
with
this
change,
who
said,
i
know
better.
i
know
that
this
is
a
new
organization,
that
it
doesn't
have
majority
support,
even
if
there's
no
evidence
of
that
among
what
the
employees
are
doing,
and
i
am
going
to
refuse
to
bargain.
and
that's
why
this
is,
quite
simply,
a
dagger
at
our
heart
because
unions
can't
stand
still.
these
changes
are
the
natural...
are
a
natural
part
of
life,
and
if
the
labor
board
can
create
an
extra
statutory
procedure
of
this
kind
and
say,
you
have
to
do
this
kind
of
change
in
this
way
of
the
employer
can
stop
bargaining,
have
to
elect
your
officers
in
a
certain
way,
if
you're
going
to
make
an
affiliation
decision
you
have
to
have
votes
bargaining
unit
by
bargaining
unit--
mr.
laurence
gold
--that
was
the
form
of
it,
but
it
was
against
a--
mr.
laurence
gold
--it
can.
mr.
laurence
gold
it
can,
and
in
many
cases,
and
this
is
why
i
say,
the
practical
issue
here
is
whether
the
board
can
go
outside
its
statutory
jurisdiction
and
give
the
employer
a
basis
of
refusing
to
bargain.
what
happened
here--
mr.
laurence
gold
--yes.
that's
what
happened
here.
the
employer--
mr.
laurence
gold
--not
under
the
present
board
rule.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
because
the
board
says
that
even
though
being
part
of
a
larger
unit
doesn't
change
you,
the
employer
can
say,
"i
don't
want
to
deal
with
you.
"
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
absolutely.
it...
the
reason
unions
go
and
ask
for
these
changes
of
certification
is
not
that
they
care
that
these
words
are
added.
it
is
that
the
board
holds
that
even
though
this
change
isn't
a
change
in
the
representative,
and
even
though
the
change
doesn't
create
any
objective
indicia,
that
the
employees
no
longer
wish
to
be
represented
by
the
union,
and
even
though
no
employee
comes
to
the
board
and
says,
we
want
a
decertification
election,
this
change
is
enough
to
permit--
mr.
laurence
gold
--correct.
or
it
said,
we
won't
hold
any
election.
mr.
laurence
gold
correct.
and
it's--
mr.
laurence
gold
--yes.
mr.
laurence
gold
it
would
determine--
mr.
laurence
gold
--yes.
the
employees
may
never
seek
a
decertification,
but--
mr.
laurence
gold
--no,
they
would
simply
at
that
point
dismiss
the
union's
request
to
amend
the
certification,
but
under
the
law
at
that
point
the
employer
would
know
that
he
can
say,
you
are
a
new
organization,
you
have
never
received
a
vote
from
the
entire
unit
making
you
the
exclusive
representative
and
therefore
i
don't
have
to
deal.
mr.
laurence
gold
that's
right,
and
putting
aside
the
question
that
i
was
discussing
with
justice
o'connor,
whether
the
board
can
say
that
any
old
change
destroys
the
effect
of
this
first
election,
at
least
that
way
we
would
be
within
the
statutory
framework.
here
the
board
is
trying
to
go
in
two
directions
at
once
and
that
is
why
we
say
that
this
is
a
failure
at
the
first
level,
a
failure
of
reasoned
decision
making
and
a
failure
by
which
the
board
moves
into
an
area
that
congress
simply
did
not
give
it.
the
board
can
hold
representation
elections.
it
has
the
authority,
if
an
employer
says
that
particular
change
is
such
that
he
won't
bargain
to
determine
when
there
is
a
new
organization,
but
to
say
there
is
one
organization
and
we
are
going
to
regulate
how
that
organization
evolves
is
something
that
we
believe
the
act
does
not
permit
the
board
to
do.
i'd
like
to
emphasize
two
points
about
the
reason
that
these
are
differences
of
substance.
the
board
determination
that
the
union
has
to
conduct
its
affairs
in
a
particular
way
may
have
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
any
fair
evaluation
of
the
type
of
events
which
will
cause
a
change
of
employee
sentiment.
i
certainly
don't
know
of
anything,
the
board
hasn't
attempted
to
tell
us
anything,
about
how
employees
will
react
to
a
dues
increase
versus
how
they
will
react
to
a
change
in
affiliation
versus
how
they
will
react
to
a
change
in
the
constitution
of
the
union.
in
all
our
democratic
affairs
we
understand
that
there
are
people
who
can
and
normally
do
have
a
commitment
to
the
process
which
is
greater
than
their
commitment
to
any
particular
issue.
you
can
have
the
hardest-fought
political
campaign
in
this
country
and
a
vote
of
51
or
50.2,
whatever
president
kennedy
won
by,
to
49.9,
and
that
doesn't
mean
that
after
the
election
that
the
49
percent
reject
our
system
of
government.
what
the
change
means
is
a
very
complex
inquiry
and
there's
just
no
need
in
this
situation,
given
the
way
congress
structured
the
act,
to
look
to
the
kinds
of
issues
the
board
is
trying
to
inject
itself
into
as
proxies.
the
employees
have
the
right,
if
they
don't
like
the
way
the
union
and
its
members
are
evolving
the
organization,
to
go
to
the
labor
board
and
say,
we
want
a
decertification
election.
what's
really
at
issue
here,
and
what
cuts
to
the
heart
of
the
act,
is
that
the
board
is
creating
a
new
procedure
outside
that,
and
most
important,
by
doing
so
giving
the
employer
the...
rather
than
the
employees.
the
employer
doesn't
have
to
show
anything
objective
that
shows
that
the
employees,
after
evaluating
this
change,
want
to
get
rid
of
this
continuing
entity,
under
the
board
law.
mr.
laurence
gold
that's
correct.
it
should
either
be
a
decertification
election
or
changes
in
the
way
the
employees
are
reacting
to
the
union.
mr.
laurence
gold
that's
correct.
mr.
laurence
gold
no.
indeed,
the
one
constant
in
industrial
life
in
this
country,
and
the
one
thing
that
congress
was
very,
very
well
aware
of
when
it
came
to
look
at
the
act
in
'47,
has
been
the
conflict
between
differing
groups
of
unions.
there
was
an
afl
and
there
was
a
cio.
the
early
cases
concern
unions
bouncing
back
and
forth.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
there
are
many
unions--
mr.
laurence
gold
--yes.
most
unions
deal
with
this
question,
one
of
the
most
basic
ones
so
far
as
the
evolution
of
the
organization
is
concerned,
in
their
constitution
and
normally
when
you
get
national
organizations
you
don't
have
every
member
voting,
as
you
will
notice,
and
you
can't.
we
wouldn't
be
able
to
do
it,
as
you
will
notice.
this
organization
affiliated--
mr.
laurence
gold
--right,
but
only
after
the
membership
has
agreed
in
the
constitution.
thank
you
very
much.
