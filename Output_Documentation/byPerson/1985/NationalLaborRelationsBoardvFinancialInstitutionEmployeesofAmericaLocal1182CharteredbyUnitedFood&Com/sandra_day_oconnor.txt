mr.
come,
may
i
inquire
whether
it's
your
view
that
the
board
will
similarly
require
vote
by
all
employees
if
the
union
adopted
some
controversial
change
to
its
own
constitution
of
by-laws?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
without
putting
it
another
way,
could
you
answer
the
question?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
hutcheson,
does
the
labor-management
relations
act
impose
any
requirement
that
union
members
vote
on
such
things
as
a
decision
to
strike,
or
to
have
a
new
collective
bargaining
agreement?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
by
your
reasoning,
because
maybe
a
majority
of
the
members
wouldn't
favor
a
decision
to
strike,
perhaps
the
board
under
your
theory
could
then
require
an
election,
either
among
union
members
or
all
employees?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
yet,
congress
has
rejected
that,
hasn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
isn't
it
quite
similar
here,
really?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
about
a
constitutional
or
by-law
change
of
the
union
itself?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--on
that
point,
mr.
gold,
the
board
has
to
decide
basically
how
broadly
to
define
a
particular
bargaining
unit,
for
instance
whether
craft
and
unskilled
workers
are
involved,
and
that's
a
board
decision.
and
yet,
in
a
globe-type
election
the
board
can
conduct
elections
of
employees,
going
to
that
issue.
is
that
similar
to
this?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
isn't
expressly
authorized
in
the
statute.
so,
how
do
you
distinguish
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
can
it
make
the
same
argument
here,
that's
part
of
our
overall
assistance
in
deciding
whether
to
call
a
recertification
election?
