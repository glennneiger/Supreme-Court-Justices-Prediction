rehnquist
well,
you
say,
mr.
gold,
you're
saying
what
the
system
is
and
intimating
that
what
the
board
has
done
now
is
contrary
to
what
the
system
is.
and
yet,
what
you're
saying
the
system
is,
itself
evolved
by
board
decision--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--what
about
the
contract
bar
rule?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
let
me
ask
you
this.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
a
feeling
from
reading
the
opinion
of
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
they
were
saying,
this
is
not
rational
because
there
are
other
board
decisions
that
cut
the
other
way,
and
to
me
that
doesn't
make
such
sense
because
the
board
can
always
modify,
and
if
you're
just
talking
about
modifying
one
board
decision
by
another
it's
hard
to
say
that
it's
irrational.
you're
not
arguing
that
point?
