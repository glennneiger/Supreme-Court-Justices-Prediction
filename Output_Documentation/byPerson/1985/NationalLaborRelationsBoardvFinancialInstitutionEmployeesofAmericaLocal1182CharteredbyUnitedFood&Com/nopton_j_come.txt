mr.
nopton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
another
kind
of
voting
rights
question,
specifically
whether
the
national
labor
relations
board
reasonably
exercised
the
broad
discretion
which
it
possesses
to
establish
and
administer
the
procedures
and
petitions
for
certifying
a
labor
organization
as
the
statutory
bargaining
representative,
and
concluding
that
all
bargaining
unit
employees
are
not
just
union
members
must
be
afforded
an
opportunity
to
vote
on
the
affiliation
of
their
bargaining
representative
with
an
international
union
before,
the
board
will
substitute
the
newly
affiliated
union
for
the
old
union
as
the
unit
employees'
exclusive
bargaining
representative.
the
basic
facts
are
these:
the
first
bank
independent
employees'
association
fiea,
was
certified
by
the
board
in
1970
after
winning
a
board
election.
it
was
certified
as
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative
of
a
unit
consisting
of
all
of
the
employees
of
the
seattle
first
national
bank
in
the
state
of
washington.
the
fiea
negotiated
successive
collective
bargaining
agreements
with
the
bank,
the
last
expiring
in
1977.
in
1977
the
fiea
executive
council
decided
to
seek
affiliation
with
the
detail
clerks
international
union
and
a
union
affiliation
election
was
scheduled
for
february
1978.
prior
to
the
election
all
bargaining
unit
employees
were
informed
of
the
proposed
affiliation
and
toll
that
only
those
who
were
union
members
as
of
january
of
'78
would
be
eligible
to
vote.
at
the
time
of
the
affiliation
vote
about
2,600
of
the
4,790
of
the
employees
in
the
unit
were
fiea
members.
1,206
voted
for
the
affiliation
and
774
voted
against.
the
2,176
non-members
comprising
over
45
percent
of
the
unit
were
not
permitted
to
vote.
the
fiea
is
chartered
by
the
international
union
as
financial
institution
employees
of
america
local
1182
which
is
the
respondent
here.
the
local
filed
a
petition
with
the
board
seeking
amendment
of
the
outstanding
certification
in
favor
of
fiea
to
reflect
this
affiliation.
the
board
has
a
procedure,
102.60-v
of
its
rules,
that
provides
the
board
may
amend
a
certification
in
the
absence
of
a
question
concerning
representation.
the
board
initially
granted
the
amendment
relying
on
its
then
current
view
that
affiliation
of
an
independent
union
with
an
international
was
essentially
an
internal
union
matter
in
which
non-members
were
not
entitled
to
vote.
the
board
subsequently,
in
a
case
called
amoco
four,
reversed
its
earlier
position
and
concluded
that
affiliation
because
of
its
impact
on
the
right
of
all
bargaining
unit
employees
to
choose
their
representatives
is
not
a
purely
internal
union
affair
and
therefore
that
an
affiliation
election,
if
it
is
to
serve
as
a
basis
or
board
amendment
of
the
certification,
must
be
open
to
all
union
members.
mr.
nopton
j.
come
yes,
it
was
another
three
to
two
decision,
yes,
your
honor.
the
board's...
i
might
say
that
this
is
an
issue
that
has
divided
the
board
for
over
20
years,
and
the
board
has
changed
its
mind
on
this
issue
within
that
period
several
times.
it
is
now
of
the
view
that
the
view
expressed
in
amoco
four,
which
has
been
sustained
by
the
fifth
circuit,
better
effectuates
and
is
more
consonant
with
the
purposes
of
the
act.
pursuant
to
its
decision
in
amoco
four,
the
board
which
had
originally
amended
the
certification
in
this
case,
reversed
their
decision
and
dismissed
the
petition
to
amend
the
certification
and
the
unfair
labor
practice
complaint
that
it
issued
based
thereon.
on
review
to
the
ninth
circuit,
the
ninth
circuit
set
aside
the
board's
determination,
and
that's
why
we're
here.
to
put
the
problem
in
perspective
with
a
little
bit
of
a
background,
section
9-c-1
of
the
act
requires
the
board
to
direct
an
election
by
secret
ballot
and
to
certify
the
results
thereof
whenever
it
finds
that
a
question
of
representative
has
been
raised,
as
to
whether
the
employees
desire
to
select
a
union
as
their
bargaining
representative
or
to
cut
or
replace
a
previously
designated
representative.
all
unit
employees
have
the
right
to
participate
in
a
board
conducted
election.
well
established
rules
and
procedures
ensure
that
employees
will
have
an
opportunity
to
make
a
free
choice
after
hearing
the
views
of
all
interested
parties,
including
the
employer.
the
union
that
is
certified
becomes
the
bargaining
representative
for
all
unit
members,
and
is
under
a
duty
to
represent
them
fairly
whether
they
are
members
of
the
union
or
not
members
of
the
union,
as
this
court
has
often
recognized.
now,
after
a
union
has
been
certified,
it
often
undergoes
organizational
changes
ranging
from
a
mere
name
change
to
things
that
are
more
substantial
such
as
affiliation
with
an
international
union
which
is
what
we
have
here.
the
industrial
stability,
in
the
board's
view,
which
the
act
seeks
to
promote,
would
be
unnecessarily
disturbed
if
every
union
organizational
adjustment
were
to
warrant
a
redetermination
of
the
bargaining
representative
through
a
board
conducted
election.
accordingly,
the
board
has
established
a
procedure,
which
i
have
referred
to
earlier,
whereby
it
will
permit
a
union
that
has
affiliated
or
undergone
some
other
similar
organic
change
to
step
into
the
shoes
of
the
old
union
without
a
board
election,
provided
that
certain
requirements
are
met.
first,
the
board
requires
that
there
be
reliable
evidence
that
the
change
reflects
the
wishes
of
the
affected
employees.
and
what
the
board--
mr.
nopton
j.
come
--that...
putting
the
question
the
other
way,
i
believe
the
argument
is
made
that
an
affiliation
decision
is
like
a--
mr.
nopton
j.
come
--i
was
attempting,
your
honor.
the
answer
would
be,
it
would
depend
upon
whether
the
change
affected
the
representational
interests
of
the
employees.
now,
such
things
as
a
change
in
union
officers,
procedures
for
authorizing
strikes,
contract
ratifications--
mr.
nopton
j.
come
--or
dues
increases,
as
this
court
recognized
in
brown
and
particularly
in
your
dissenting
opinion,
justice
white,
are
things
that--
mr.
nopton
j.
come
--well,
i
think
that
justice
o'connor's
opinion
also
recognized
the
point,
are
matters
that
the
union
can
confine
to
union
members,
but
when
it
comes
to
selecting
the
bargaining
representative,
that
right
is
more
absolute
and
the
way
you
come
out
on
this
issue,
and
i
must
acknowledge
that
reasonable
people
can
differ
as
to
how
you
are
going
to
come
out
here,
and
the
question
is
not
whether
another
answer
would
be
reasonable
or
equally
reasonable
but
whether
the
board
is
reasonable
in--
mr.
nopton
j.
come
--well,
the
board
is
saying
that--
mr.
nopton
j.
come
--the
board
is
saying
that
if
we
are
going
to
accept
a
union
election
for
amending
our
certification,
we
want
to
be
satisfied
that
it
has
been
conducted
with...
pursuant
to
democratic
principles
that
at
least
ensure
that
all
of
the
affected
employees
have
had
a
fair
opportunity--
mr.
nopton
j.
come
--it
may--
mr.
nopton
j.
come
--well--
mr.
nopton
j.
come
--i
started
to
say
that
there
are
two
requirements
before
the
board
will
amend
a
certification.
the
first
is
to
be
satisfied
that
the
bargaining
unit
has
had
an
opportunity
to
say
that
they
favor
the
change.
the
second
requirement
is
that
the
change
is
not
so
drastic
in
terms
of
reorganizing
the
union
that
the
reorganized
union
is
really
a
totally
different
union
form
the
one
that
was
originally
certified.
that's
referred
to
as
a
break
in
continuity.
if
you
get
a
break
in
continuity,
then
the
board
says,
that
presents
a
question
that
is
going
to
have
to
be
resolved.
mr.
nopton
j.
come
through
certification,
so
that
we're
only
at
step
one
of
what
is
a...
the
inquiry
that
the
board
will
make
before
it
determines
that
it
can
use
the
short-cut
procedure
or
whether
it's
got
to
go
through
the
long
procedure.
i
want
to
save
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
but
the
point
that
i
want
to
leave
with
is
that,
as
i
started
to
say,
we
submit
as
i'm
sure
my
colleague
will
flesh
out,
that
the
board's
current
position
is
a
reasonable
one
and
consonant
with
the
policies
of
the
act
and
therefore
should
be
sustained.
mr.
nopton
j.
come
the
inconsistency
that
mr.
gold
has
posed
is
illusory
in
the
sense
that
as
i
pointed
out
earlier,
the
board
has
not
made
a
continuity
determination
in
this
case
yet.
it
says
that
under
its
position,
it
will
not
reach
that
lengthy
determination
unless
there
is
first
some
evidence
that
the
affected
employees
want
the
change.
the
question
is
whether
the
board
has
authority
and
is
reasonable
in
imposing
that
threshold
requirement.
we
submit
that
it
can
do
so
under
the
statute
as
an
incident
of
its
general
authority
to
police
its
certifications.
as
the
cases
pointed
out
in
footnote
11
of
the
board's
brief
on
page
17
show,
there
are
a
variety
of
other
situations
in
which
the
board,
even
though
it
is
not
specifically
spelled
out
in
the
statute
but
as
an
incident
of
administering
section
9-a
and
b
of
the
statute,
will
conduct
elections
and
inquiries
to
determine
whether
or
not
its
certification
should
be
revoked
or
amended
or
modified.
it
may
do
so
to
clarify
the
scope
of
a
bargaining
unit,
as
justice
o'connor
has
pointed
out.
it
may
do
so
as
in
the
hughes
tool
case,
to
revoke
a
certification
where
it
finds
that
the
union
has
been
guilty
of
practicing
racial
discrimination.
here,
similarly,
it
is
the
board,
we
submit,
has
the
discretion
and
the
power
to
determine
the
circumstances
under
which
it
is
going
to
amend
the
certification
and
change
the
designation
of
the
certified
bargaining
representative.
the
union
that
was
certified
here
was
an
independent
union.
the
employees
at
this
installation
had
only
recently
in
a
board
election
voted
against
affiliation
with
an
international
union
before
the
independent
was
certified.
the
union
then
comes
back
and
asks
for
the
amendment.
we
submit
that
the
board
was
reasonable
in
imposing
this
threshold,
democratic
requirement
for
amending
the
certification.
thank
you.
