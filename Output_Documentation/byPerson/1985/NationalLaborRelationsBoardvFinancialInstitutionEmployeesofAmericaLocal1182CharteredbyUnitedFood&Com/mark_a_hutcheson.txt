mr.
mark
a.
hutcheson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
we
see
it,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
board
acted
rationally
when
it
refused
to
certify
respondent
as
the
exclusive
bargaining
agent
for
all
of
the
employees
in
the
bargaining
unit
following
an
affiliation
election
in
which
less
than
30
percent
of
that
bargaining
unit
voted
in
favor
of
the
affiliation
that
led
to
respondent
becoming
a
new
local
union,
what
is
now
known
as
united
food
and
commercial
workers.
mr.
mark
a.
hutcheson
yes,
your
honor.
that
would
be
correct.
of
course,
i
am
today
most
concerned
about
my
client's
case,
and
the
facts
in
this
case.
mr.
mark
a.
hutcheson
that's
correct.
mr.
mark
a.
hutcheson
yes,
sir,
and
that
policy
has
been
upheld
by
both
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
a
few
months
ago
by
the
seventh
circuit.
mr.
mark
a.
hutcheson
more
often
than
not--
mr.
mark
a.
hutcheson
--yes,
your
honor,
but
in
this
case
again,
back
in
1975
when
the
affiliation
election
took
place
involving
my
client's
employees,
the
board
had
adjudicated
the
same
rule
in
a
case
called
jasper
section
company
and
the
board...
and
the
union
in
that
case,
the
union
back
in
1978
in
this
case
knew
it.
mr.
mark
a.
hutcheson
yes.
mr.
mark
a.
hutcheson
the
court
first
took
a
look
at
the
so-called
due
process,
or
we
would
prefer
to
call
it,
the
employee
consent
issue,
back
in
1963.
mr.
mark
a.
hutcheson
and
that
was...
the
north
electric
case
was
another
three
to
two
decision,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
a.
hutcheson
that
went
the
other
way.
but
the
times
have
changed,
and
that
often
occurs
in
the
field
of
industrial
relations,
and
the
board
has
come
to
the
conclusion
that
an
affiliation
effects
significant
changes,
at
least
significant
enough
to
put
at
risk
the
potential
that
employees
in
the
bargaining
unit
might
desire
not
to
be
represented
by
the
affiliated
union
following
affiliation.
mr.
mark
a.
hutcheson
yes,
your
honor.
that's
correct,
and
we
submit
that
this
is
one
such
case.
the
point
is,
back
in
1977
it
should
not
have
been
any
surprise
to
this
particular
union
that
the
board
was
going
to
expect
an
all-employee
vote
on
this
issue,
but
that
union
chose
to
ignore
that
requirement
and
now
seeks
the
benefits
of
board
certification,
and
this
is
even
though
only
25
percent
of
the
entire
bargaining
unit
has
evidenced
any
desire
to
be
represented
by
the
affiliated
union.
that,
of
course,
is--
mr.
mark
a.
hutcheson
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
a.
hutcheson
no,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
mark
a.
hutcheson
--that's
correct,
and
so
has
this
court.
mr.
mark
a.
hutcheson
we
submit
that
it
is
not,
because
issues
such
as
who
the
officers
should
be,
what
the
dues
should
be,
whether
there
should
be
a
strike,
whether
the
contract
should
be
ratified,
are
all
decisions
that
go
to
the
internal
operation
and
affairs
of
the
delegated
body,
namely
the
union.
but,
that
is
the
different--
mr.
mark
a.
hutcheson
--in
the
vast
majority
of
cases,
such
a
change
would
not
go
to
the
very
identity
of
the
organization
making
that
change.
there
is
one
decision,
one
issue
that
congress
has
been
very
clear
about,
reserving
to
the
employees,
and
that
is
the
original
designation
of
the
bargaining
agent.
once
the
voters
vote
for
a
union,
they
then
delegate
to
that
union
all
those
other
decisions
we
were
talking
about.
mr.
mark
a.
hutcheson
well,
except
questions
that
go
to
the
identity
of
the
selected
organization.
mr.
mark
a.
hutcheson
they
haven't
really
reached
that
point
yet,
your
honor.
they
are
still
at
the
threshold
inquiry.
mr.
mark
a.
hutcheson
well,
the
statute,
interestingly
enough,
your
honor,
does
not
address
amended
certifications
at
all.
there
appears
to
be
no
statutory--
mr.
mark
a.
hutcheson
--yet.
mr.
mark
a.
hutcheson
what
the
board
is
saying,
that
before
we
undertake
the
utilization
of
our
time
and
energy
and
resources
to
conduct
what
is
called
a
continuity
inquiry,
we
want
to
at
least
first
check
in
with
the
employees
who
are
affected
by
this
and
see
if
they've
had
an
opportunity
to
express
themselves
on
the
point.
you
see,
there
are
two...
this
issue--
mr.
mark
a.
hutcheson
--in
sections
1,
7
and
9
in
the
act
where
the
congress
has
clearly
delegated
to
the
board
the
duty
and
responsibility
to
insure
that
employees
have
full
freedom
of
association
and
the
ability
to
choose
representatives
of
their
choice,
and
it
also
has
the--
mr.
mark
a.
hutcheson
--yes,
and
the
board
has
certainly
a
legitimate
interest
in
policing
its
own
certification
procedures
and
insuring
that
they
are
not
undermined
or
circumvented
by
having
affiliated
organizations--
mr.
mark
a.
hutcheson
--it's
very
much
so,
your
honor.
we
would
agree
that
this
is
a
prophylactic
measure,
and
if
unions
comply
with
it,
which
it
is
simple
to
do,
then
we
may
never
have
to
reach
that
continuity
inquiry
because
the
board
recognizes
that
this
issue
should
be
looked
at
through
two
sets
of
eyes,
the
employees'
eyes
and
the
board's
eyes,
and
what
counts
most
is
what
the
employees
want.
the
act
was
passed,
after
all,
to
protect
the
interests
of
employees,
not
unions.
the
board
says,
certainly
we
need
to
take
a
look
too
and
determine
whether
in
our
opinion
there
have
been
sufficient
substantial
changes
to
justify
a
board
conducted
election,
but
we
may
in
our
opinion
believe
that
a
particular
affiliation
is
not
very
substantial,
but
employees
involved
who
are
affected
in
the
bargaining
unit
may
have
completely
different
ideas.
so,
your
honor,
particularly
in
a
case
where
over
30
percent...
i
mean,
over
60
percent
of
the
bargaining
unit
either
voted
against
affiliation
or
never
had
any
opportunity
to
express
themselves
or
the
issue
at
all,
that
the
board's
rule,
especially
applied
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
is
rational
and
is
consistent
with
the
act,
and
it
is
entitled
to
deference.
what
we
cannot
understand
is,
why
not
let
the
employees
vote?
what
harm
would
be
done?
mr.
mark
a.
hutcheson
it's
certainly
rational
and
consistent
with
the
act
to
grant
to
employees
the
right
to
make
sure
that
their
representative,
should
they
want
one,
is
selected
by
them.
we
also
submit,
your
honor,
that
the
board's
rule
and
its
position
in
this
case
is
consistent
with
another
significant
objective
of
the
act
which
is
to
promote
industrial
stability.
any
time
a
party
goes
to
the
bargaining
table,
it
is
very
important
that
the
other
party
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
has
no
doubt
as
to
that
agent's
authority
to
represent
its
principal.
in
this
case
the
principals
are
the
employees,
and
in
fact
the
agent
is
the
principal
for
even
those
minority
of
employees
who
may
not
have
voted
for
the
union
at
the
outset
because
of
the
doctrine
of
exclusive
representation.
and,
if
there
is
any
doubt
or
uncertainty
as
to
the
representative
capacity
of
the
union
at
the
bargaining
table,
then
there
is
smaller
odds
than
normally
would
exist
that
an
agreement
can
be
effectively
reached.
in
fact,
in
this
case
my
client
has
every
reason
to
really
question
whether
respondent
truly
represents
a
majority
of
the
employees,
and
in
fact
may
wonder
whether
it
even
should
or
can
legitimately
enter
into
an
agreement
when
there
is
such
a
reason
for
questioning.
the
board's
rule,
unlike
the
court
below's
decision,
does
much
more
to
promote
industrial
stability
by
removing--
mr.
mark
a.
hutcheson
--i
would--
mr.
mark
a.
hutcheson
--i
think
i'd
have
to
admit,
your
honor,
that
having
thoughtfully
applied
its
view
of
the
law
to
the
facts
in
any
given
case,
that
either
approach
could
be
rational,
and
we
believe
that
the
board's
current
rule
in
this
issue
is
rational.
