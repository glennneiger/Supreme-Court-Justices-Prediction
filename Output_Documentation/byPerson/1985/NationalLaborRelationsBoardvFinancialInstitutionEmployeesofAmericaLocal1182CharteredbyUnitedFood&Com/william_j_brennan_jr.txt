justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
jasper
was
a
change
in
the
board
decision,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
long
had
it
followed
a
different
policy
before
jasper?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
other
way?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
i
recall
it,
we
have
cases
in
which
we
have
sustained
the
board's
change
of
position
based
on
the
experience
in
the
real
world.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
guess
for
the
same
reason,
mr.
gold,
you'd
argue
that
this
certainly
doesn't
fall
within
the
category
of
a
change
to
adapt
to
changing
patterns
of
industrial
life?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
mr.
gold,
may
come
unions
change
affiliation
as
they
attempted
here,
without
any
vote
of
their
membership?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
does
that
require
a
constitutional
provision
in
the
union
constitution?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
this
is
by
action
of
the
board
of
trustees
of
the
union?
