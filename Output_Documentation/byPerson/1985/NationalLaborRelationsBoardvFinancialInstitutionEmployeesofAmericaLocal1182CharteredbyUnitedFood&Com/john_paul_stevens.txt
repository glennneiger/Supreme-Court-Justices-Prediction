justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it's
your
position,
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
is
that
when
the
paper
is
filed
saying,
i
want
to
change
our
name,
it's
at
that
point
the
board
should
make
the
continuity
determination?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
which
would
then
determine
whether
or
not
to
hold
a
decertification
election?
justice
john
paul
stevens
either
it
is
or
it
is
not
the
same
organization?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
suppose
they
decide
there's
really
more
than
a
name
change
here,
it's
a
fundamental
change,
it's
too
important
to
just
approve,
then
what
do
they
do?
election?
then
they
would
require
election,
or
would
they?
