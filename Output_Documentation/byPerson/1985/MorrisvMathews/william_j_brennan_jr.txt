justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
drake,
he
was
prosecuted
for
aggravated
murder,
was
he
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
did
the
state
concede
in
the
federal
court,
not
just
state
court,
that
the
trial
for
aggravated
murder
violated
double
jeopardy?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
that
have
any
bearing
on
the
issue
we
have
to
decide?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
there's
still
the
issue
of
the
modification
of
the
sentence?
