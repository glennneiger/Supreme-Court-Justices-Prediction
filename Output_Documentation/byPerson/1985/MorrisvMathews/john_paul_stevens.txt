justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
go
back,
since
you
have
been
interrupted,
to
justice
o'connor's
question
earlier
about
whether
the
same
evidence
would
have
been
admissible
in
the
trial
for
the
lesser
offense
than
was
actually
received.
after
our
remand
in
the
light
of
vitale,
the
ohio
court
of
appeals
reduced
the
charge,
as
i
understand,
reduced
the
sentence.
did
they
base
that
on
just
an
automatic
rule
that
that
took
care
of
the
double
jeopardy
problem,
or
did
they
also
decide
that
the
evidence
would
have
been
the
same
anyway?
or,
they
didn't
reach
that,
as
i
remember.
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
the
time
of
the
remand
in
light
of
vitale,
was
there
another
argument
before
the
ohio
appellate
court
or
did
the
court
just
take
the
case
and
then
issue
its
judgment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
one
of
the
things
that's
worrying
me
about
the
case,
if
the
issue
should
be
controlling,
and
i'm
not
saying
it
should
but
as
justice
o'connor
raised
the
question,
i'm
just
wondering,
where
in
the
first
instance
should
the
decision
be
made
as
to
whether
there
would
have
been
some
admissibility
problem
in
another
case?
i
hate
to
get
into
that
myself
as
a
federal
judge.
i
just
wonder
what
your
views
should
be
on
how
that
should
be
done.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you're
also
not
sure
they
had
a
chance
to
raise
it,
as
i
understand,
because
there
may
not
have
been
briefing
at
that
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
did
not
have
a
right,
did
he,
to
be
free
of
a
trial
on
the
lesser
offense
for
which
he
now
stands
convicted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
he
didn't
at
any
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
their
contention
is,
is
that
what
he
got
was
the
equivalent
of
a
trial
he
could
have
gotten?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
their
contention,
not
yours.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
one
other
question.
your
opponent
relies
on
benton
against
maryland
and
says
the
remedy
in
that
case
is
consistent
with
the...
the
remedy
was
permitted
under
this
court's
mandate,
was
consistent
with
the
remedy
that
the
ohio
court
granted
here.
and
i
understand
your
response
to
that
was
that
you
think
it
was
overruled
by
price
against
georgia.
is
that
your
view?
