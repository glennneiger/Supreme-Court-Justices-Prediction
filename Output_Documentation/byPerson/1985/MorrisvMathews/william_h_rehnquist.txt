justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
contend,
mr.
dane,
that
the
relief
awarded
by
the
sixth
circuit
is
the
proper
relief?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
struck
me
as
a
rather
odd
form
of
relief
for
a
claim
of
double
jeopardy
violation
to
award
the
prisoner
a
new
trial.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
would
also
be
free
under
the
sixth
circuit's
reasoning
to
retry
him?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
it
be
under
your
reasoning
too?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that's
the
relief
he
gets
for
a
claim
of
double
jeopardy?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
dane,
a
long
time
ago
justice
mclean
of
this
court,
in
the
days
when
the
double
jeopardy
clause
was
thought
to
bar
even
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
of
someone
who
had
been
sentenced
to
be
hung
made
a
motion
for
a
new
trial,
and
the
government
said,
you
can't
have
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
because
it
would
violate
his
right
against
double
jeopardy
to
have
a
new
trial.
justice
mclean
said,
i'm
not
going
to
deny
his
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
save
his
double
jeopardy
and
preserve
his
right
to
be
hung.
it
strikes
me
as
a
little
bit
of
the
same
thing
in
your
argument,
that
you're
insisting
that
double
jeopardy
was
violated
and
yet,
what
you
come
out
with
is
another
trial
for
the
man.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
can
see
that
if
it
were
granted,
he
would
be
tryable
on
the
same
murder
charge
on
a
new
indictment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
abney
was
a
federal
case.
it
was
interpretation
of
federal
rules.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we've
never
held
that
a
state
has
to
accord
an
interlocutory
appeal
to...
prior
to
trial
to
protect
the
double
jeopardy--
