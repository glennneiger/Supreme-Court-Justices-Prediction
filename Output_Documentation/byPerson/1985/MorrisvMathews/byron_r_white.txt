justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
defend
those
reasons,
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
represent
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--so,
you
don't...
well,
but
you
were
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
you
make
the
arguments
to
that
court
that
you're
going
to
make
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
rejected
them,
or
just
ignored
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
do
you
want
your
client
to
go
through
another
trial
on
an
offense
you
admit
he
can
be
tried
for?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
the
defendant
have
appealed
prior
to
his
trial?
he
moved
to
bar
the
prosecution
based
on
double
jeopardy
and
was
turned
down.
he
didn't
need
to
wait
until
he
was
tried,
did
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
let's
assume
that
there
was
an
interlocutory
appeal
after
his
motion
to
dismiss
was
denied
and
the
trial
court
was
affirmed
by
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
i
suppose
there
could
have
been
petition
for
cert
here,
or
what
is
your
view?
could
he
then
have
gone
directly
to
the
federal
district
court
on
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
there
are
ways
now
to
avoid
the
trial?
