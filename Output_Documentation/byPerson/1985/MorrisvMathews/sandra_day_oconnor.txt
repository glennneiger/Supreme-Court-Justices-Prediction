mr.
drake,
would
all
the
same
evidence
be
admissible,
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
guess
your...
the
respondent
takes
the
position
that
not
every
bit
of
that
evidence
would
be
admissible
at
the
new
trial?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
drake,
why
would
the
state
allow
the
entry
of
the
guilty
plea
to
robbery
when
it
knew
that
there
was
a
murder
charge
that
should
have
been
made?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
that
the
correct
information
had
been
made
available
before
the
entry
of
the
guilty
plea.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
drake,
we're
dealing
with
a
constitutional
violation.
does
that
mean
we
have
to
apply
a
chapman
type
standard?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what's
the
standard,
no
reasonable
possibility
of
prejudice?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
think
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
defendant?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
in
the
peculiar
circumstances
of
this
case,
where
the
respondent
could
in
fact
be
re-charged
and
tried
again,
what
is
to
be
gained
by
going
through
the
process
again?
it
just
strikes
one
as
peculiar.
