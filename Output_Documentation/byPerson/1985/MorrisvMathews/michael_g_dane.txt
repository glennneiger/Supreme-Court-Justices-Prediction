mr.
michael
g.
dane
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
ask
the
court
on
behalf
of
the
respondent
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
i
make
that
request
on
the
basis
of
reasons
different
from
the
reasons
used
by
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
mr.
michael
g.
dane
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
sixth
circuit
decision
was
right
in
its
consideration
of
the
fairness
of
the
trial,
but
i
don't
believe
that
it
appropriately
considered
fairness
because
i
believe
that
the
issue
presented
here
is
one
in
which
fairness
of
the
trial
is
not
dispositive.
mr.
michael
g.
dane
no,
i
didn't,
your
honor.
our
office
was
assigned
by
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
mr.
michael
g.
dane
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
g.
dane
yes,
sir.
i
made
them.
mr.
michael
g.
dane
they
rejected
the
argument
that
the
fairness
issue
should
not
be
reached,
but
when
they
reached
the
fairness
issue
they
decided
it
in
favor
of
the
respondent.
mr.
michael
g.
dane
your
honor,
i
agree
that
granting
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
is
proper.
the
sixth
circuit
decision
says
it
is
remanded
for
retrial.
i
take
the
position
there
cannot
be
a
retrial
on
this
indictment
although
the
state
is
free
to
seek
another
indictment
on
a
murder
charge
and
retry
mr.
mathews
on
that
charge.
mr.
michael
g.
dane
i
don't
believe
i
disagree
with
the
petitioner
that
that
is
what
the
sixth
circuit
did.
what
the
sixth
circuit
did
was
grant
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
ordering
that
the
petitioner...
the
respondent
be
released
from
custody
unless
the
state
of
ohio
takes
action
to
bring
about
a
new
trial
within
the
60-day
period
of
time.
the
state
of
ohio
can,
quite
simply
by
not
acting,
bring
about
the
conclusion
that
the
petitioner
should
simply
be
released
on
the
writ.
mr.
michael
g.
dane
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
g.
dane
on
a
new
indictment,
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
g.
dane
i
suggest
that
the
sixth
circuit
should
not
have
reached
the
consideration
of
the
fairness
of
the
trial,
your
honor.
the
problem
here
between
the
petitioner
and
the
respondent,
the
point
at
which
we
part
company,
is
identification
of
the
protected
interests.
respondent...
i'm
sorry,
petitioner,
the
state
of
ohio,
identifies
the
interests
protected
here
as
the
interest
in
a
fundamentally
fair
second
prosecution
of
the
same
offense.
that's
found
on
page
35-6
of
their
brief.
i
fundamentally
disagree
with
that.
i
strongly
disagree.
the
interest
which
the
respondent
seeks
to
protect
here
is
not
his
interest
protected
by
the
clause
in
a
fair
trial.
it's
his
interest
in
no
trial.
he
has
got
a
right
under
the
united
states
constitution,
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
to
be
free
from
second
prosecution
of
the
same
offense,
not
to
have
a
fair
second
prosecution
of
the
same
offense.
that
is
the
dispositive
issue,
as
i
see
it.
mr.
michael
g.
dane
he
does
not
have
that
right
now.
mr.
michael
g.
dane
no,
he
did
not,
your
honor.
they
could
have--
mr.
michael
g.
dane
--no.
no,
sir.
my
contention
is--
mr.
michael
g.
dane
--the
state
was
permitted
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
having
accepted
guilty
pleas
to
both
robbery
and
burglary,
was
permitted
to
charge
him
with
murder
or
aggravated
murder
by
prior
calculation
and
design.
but
when
the
state
accepted
those
two
guilty
pleas,
to
robbery
and
burglary,
those
being
the
only
two
predicate
offenses
they
could
have
used
in
a
felony
murder
prosecution,
they
thereby
foreclosed
felony
murder
prosecution.
now,
he
could
have
been
prosecuted
on
the
other
offenses
but
he
was
not.
he
was
prosecuted
for
felony
murder.
the
clause
says,
"nor
shall
any
person
subject
to
the
same
offense
be
twice
put
in
jeopardy
of
life
or
limb.
"
mr.
michael
g.
dane
justice
white,
i
don't
want
him
to
go
through
another
trial,
but
the
danger
here
is
that
if
they
can,
consistent
with
the
clause,
prosecute
him
for
the
same
offense
again,
then
while
this
trial
had
been
taking
place,
the
felony
murder
trial
with
robbery
as
the
predicate
felony,
the
state
could
have
sought
and
obtained
an
indictment
charging
him
with
felony
murder
with
burglary
as
the
predicate
felony.
those
are
block
brokered
different
offenses,
and
no
matter
what
the
outcome
of
the
trial,
they
could
have
prosecuted
him
again.
his
interest
is
being
free
from
successive
prosecutions,
not...
the
interest
is
not
in
a
fair
successive
prosecution.
i
take
the
position
that
this
modification
cannot
be
adopted
as
an
appropriate
remedy
to
a
successive
prosecution-double
jeopardy
violation
by
this
court,
without
overruling
the
language,
the
reasoning
and
the
holding
in
abney
versus
the
united
states,
because
abney
said,
in
order
to
protect
the
right...
what
we
have
here
is
a
fundamental
disagreement
on
the
right
protection.
the
state
is
saying
it's
an
interest
in
a
right
to
a
fair
trial.
respondent
is
saying
it's
a
right
to
no
trial.
abney
said,
in
order
to
protect
the
right...
because
abney
identified
the
right
as
one
which
could
not
be
protected
on
direct
review.
in
order
to
protect
the
right
you
must
allow
an
interlocutory
appeal.
you
must
allow
pretrial
appeal
of
a
nonfrivolous
double
jeopardy
claim,
because
abney
identified
the
right
as
the
right
to
be
free
from
trial.
ohio
here
says
no,
we
can
protect
the
right
through
appellate
review
on
direct
appeal,
and
ohio
says
that
even
though
the
defendant
is
forced
through
that
trial
that
the
clause
says
he's
entitled
to
avoid,
his
double
jeopardy
interests
can
still
be
protected
on
direct
appeal.
mr.
michael
g.
dane
your
honor,
i
believe
that
much
of
the
evidence
at
a
second
trial
on
a
murder
charge
would
not
have
been
admissible,
but
i
also
take
the
position
that
the
question
of
fairness
or
unfairness...
i'm
not
here
to
argue
that
the
right
was
violated
because
the
trial
was
unfair.
i'm
here
to
argue
on
behalf
of
mr.
matthews
that
the
right
was
violated
because
the
trial
took
place,
and
he
can
only
be
protected
in
that
respect
by
an
interlocutory
appeal
as
recognized
in
abney
and
not
on
direct
review
through
modification.
mr.
michael
g.
dane
justice
o'connor,
what
is
to
be
gained
is
protection
of
the
right,
identification
of
the
interest
protected.
it
is
the
clause
which
says,
not
any
judge,
not
any
court,
with
all
due
respect,
it
is
the
clause
which
says
the
second
prosecution
is
unfair,
and
it
is
always
unfair
where
it
is
a
second
prosecution
of
the
same
offense.
the
right
that
the
accused
seeks
to
protect,
his
primary
interest,
is
in
avoiding
being
prosecuted
for
an
offense,
prosecuted
again
for
the
same
offense,
prosecuted
again
for
the
same
offense.
and
if
modification
is
an
appropriate
remedy,
that's
what
can
happen
to
him.
that's
the
interest
that
he
seeks
to
protect.
in
burks
versus
the
united
states,
this
court
talked
in
language
of
the
balancing
of
equities,
and
i
suggest
to
the
court
that's
exactly
what
the
lincoln
county
court
of
appeals
did
here.
after
remand
by
the
court,
the
case
went
back
to
lincoln
county,
and
the
lincoln
county
court
of
appeals
said
finally,
yes,
mr.
mathews,
your
double
jeopardy
rights
were
violated,
but
rather
than
remand
further
to
the
trial
court
to
dismiss
the
indictment,
what
we
will
do
is
take
everything
into
consideration.
we
will
balance
the
equities
and
we
will
conclude
that
we
can
remedy
this
situation
without
remand
for
dismissal
of
the
indictment.
we
can
remedy
it
by
modifying
the
result.
this
court
said
in
a
unanimous
opinion
in
burks...
and
i
suggest
abney
was
also
a
unanimous
opinion...
this
court
said,
where
the
clause
is
applicable,
and
here
we
all
agree
that
it
is,
there
are
no
equities
to
be
balanced.
its
sweep
is
absolute,
for
the
clause
has
declared
the
policy.
the
clause
declares
the
constitutional
policy,
and
the
clause
says,
there
shall
be
no
second
trial
based
on
grounds
which
this
court
has
said
are
not
open
to
judicial
examination.
mr.
michael
g.
dane
your
honor,
i
am
not
advocating
another
trial.
i
am
simply
advocating
that
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
be
granted.
mr.
michael
g.
dane
i
can
see
that,
but
that
procedure
would
protect
the
right.
that
procedure
would
identify
the
interest
protected
with
the
clause
consistently
with
the
way
this
court
did
it
in
abney
and
in
burks
and
in
price
versus
georgia.
mr.
michael
g.
dane
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
g.
dane
yes,
your
honor.
i
agree
with
that,
but
in
response
to
one
of
the
statements
made
by
mr.
drake
in
response
to
justice
stevens'
question,
there
was
no
interlocutory
appeal
pursued
here
because
this
was
a
state
case,
and
in
1978
ohio
didn't
permit
that.
it
was
not
until
state
versus
thomas
was
decided
in
ohio
in
1980,
two
years
later,
that
an
interlocutory
appeal
could
be
pursued
by
a
defendant.
i
suggest
that
the
fundamental
difference
of
opinion
is
over
identification
of
the
interests
protected.
in
the
language
of
price
versus
georgia,
what
the
state
is
requesting
be
done
here
is
the
conducting
of
a
harmless
error
test,
comparing
the
trial
which
did
take
place
to
a
trial
which
they
imagine
would
have
taken
place
had
they
been
originally
prosecuted
with
respect
to
his
double
jeopardy
rights
on
a
charge
of
murder.
but,
this
court
in
price,
also
in
a
unanimous
decision...
and
i
suggest
these
are
the
few
bedrock
decisions
in
double
jeopardy
law.
these
are
the
decisions
where
the
court
could
agree.
price
rejected
application
of
a
harmless
error
test
which
is
in
effect
being
proposed
here
today.
the
decisions
which
have
been
unanimous
in
the
double
jeopardy
area
are
cases
in
which
issues
were
presented
to
this
court
that
called
for
their
resolution
by
this
court,
upon
the
court
to
look
not
at
interpretation
of
the
language
of
the
clause
but
to
focus
its
attention
instead
on
identification
of
the
protected
interests
of
the
clause.
and,
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
the
interest
in
a
successive
prosecution
double
jeopardy
situation
is
the
interest
of
the
accused
in
remaining
free
from
that
second
trial
for
the
same
offense.
that's
all
mr.
mathews
is
asking.
he
is
asking
that
the
decisions
in
price,
in
abney,
in
burks,
be
applied
to
this
situation.
and
i
suggest
very
frankly
that
in
order
to
give
approval
to
modification
as
a
remedy
to
a
successive
prosecution
double
jeopardy
violation,
which
violation
is
admitted
here,
this
court
would
have
to
overrule
part
two
of
price
versus
georgia,
would
have
to
overrule
the
reasoning
set
forth
in
abney,
because
interlocutory
appeal
is
inconsistent
with
modification
on
direct
review,
and
would
have
to
overrule
burks
to
the
extent
that
it
says
the
sweep
of
the
clause
is
absolute
under
these
circumstances.
i
believe
that
in
appropriately
deciding
this
case,
one
must
look
and
keep
in
mind
that
the
clause
was
written,
intended
to
protect
the
accused.
it
was
not
intended
to
benefit
the
state.
the
sufficiency
and
the
appropriateness
of
a
remedy
which
is
proposed
should
be
viewed
through
the
eyes
of
the
party
designed
to
be
protected,
and
this
is
certainly
not
an
appropriate
remedy
through
the
eyes
of
the
accused
in
this
case.
mr.
mathews
was
first
a
victim
of
a
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights
when
ohio
forced
him
into
a
trial
which
they
now
admit
they
could
not
force
him
into,
consistent
with
those
rights.
after
that,
after
his
constitutional
rights
were
violated,
and
after
a
three-year
process
through
which
he
appealed,
finally
this
court
remanded
in
light
of
illinois
versus
vitale.
then
what
the
lincoln
county
court
of
appeals
did
was
compound,
not
remedy
but
compound
the
wrong
done
to
him
by
saying
to
him,
yes,
your
constitutional
rights
have
been
violated.
as
a
remedy
to
that
we
are
going
to
deem
you
a
convicted
murderer
and
sentence
you
to
serve
a
period
of
15
years
to
life
in
the
lucasville
penitentiary.
that
is
not
a
remedy
to
the
violation.
that
is
an
aggravation
of
the
violation.
there
is
but
one
way
effectively
to
insure
the
protection
of
the
constitutional
right
of
a
criminal
accused
to
be
free
from
successive
prosecution
of
the
same
offense,
and
that
single
way
is
to
absolutely
bar
successive
prosecution
of
the
same
offense,
not
to
allow
the
prosecution
to
take
place
and
force
the
accused
to
seek
on
direct
appeal
what
this
court
has
said
in
abney
he
is
entitled
to
through
an
interlocutory
appeal.
i
fundamentally
disagree
with
the
statement
of
the
issues
as
it
is
put
by
the
state
of
ohio.
mr.
michael
g.
dane
your
honor,
i
believe
that
language
did
not
survive
price
versus
georgia,
but
i
also
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
benton
was
not
a
successive
prosecution
case.
this
is
different
from
the
implied
acquittal
cases
that
we
have
in
price
versus
georgia
and
green
versus
united
states
in
1957,
where
the
prosecutor
there
is
seeking
but
that
one
conviction
he
feels
the
state
entitled
to.
here
the
prosecutor
has
got
that
conviction.
they
got
it
when
the
defendant
pled
guilty
to
robbery
and
burglary.
now
the
prosecutors
are
seeking
another
conviction.
i
don't
begrudge
them
the
right
to
do
that,
but
they
should
do
it
consistent
with
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
let
them
seek
a
second
conviction
if
they
feel
that
it's
warranted,
but
let
them
indict
him
and
let
them
prosecute
him
on
a
charge
of
aggravated
murder
by
prior
calculation
and
design,
which
is
not
jeopardy
barred,
or
let
them
charge
him
with
murder
which
is
not
jeopardy
barred.
but,
when
they
charge
him
with
felony
murder,
that
is
a
barred
offense,
and
i
suggest
that
the
prosecutors
realized
what
they
had
done
wrong
in
this
case
after
the
guilty
pleas
had
been
entered
and
after
mathews
made
a
statement
admitting
involvement
in
the
killing.
at
that
point
they
wanted
to
prosecute
him
for
murder
and
realized
that
they
had
foreclosed
felony
murder
prosecution.
having
foreclosed
felony
murder
prosecution,
they
could
only
proceed
with
the
other
offenses
and
they
knew
that
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
because
of
the
controversial
things
which
had
happened
at
the
scene
and
because
of
the
evidentiary
problems
with
this
case,
they
couldn't
prove
the
prior
calculation
and
design
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
they
couldn't
prove
straight
murder.
they
had
to
reach
back.
they
had
to
admit
before
this
jury
evidence
of
bad
character
which
was
generated
by
admitting
evidence
of
what
happened
during
the
course
of
the
robbery.
that
bad
character
evidence
is
designed
by
the
rules
of
evidence
to
be
prohibited.
that
evidence
requires
before
it
is
admitted,
a
balancing
test
be
conducted
by
the
trial
court,
which
was
not
conducted
here
because
robbery
was
an
element
of
the
offense,
improper
but
an
element
of
the
offense.
that
evidence,
if
admitted,
comes
in
under
cautionary
instructions.
it
comes
in
under
limiting
instructions.
that
was
not
done
here.
and,
the
accused
should
have
a
right
on
direct
appeal
to
say
that
the
decision
of
the
trial
court
admitting
that
evidence
was
under
the
circumstances
an
abuse
of
discretion.
that
right
of
the
accused
is
lost
here
because
the
trial
court
never
made
the
decision,
because
any
such
evidentiary
decision
was
foreclosed
when
that
court
improperly
allowed
the
trial
to
proceed
on
the
basis
of
a
jeopardy-barred
charge.
those
are
the
interests
lost
by
the
accused
when
a
double
jeopardy
violation
is
allowed
to
take
place.
at
the
heart
of
the
clause
is
his
interest
in
avoiding
successive
prosecutions
of
the
same
offense,
because
multiple
punishments
need
not
be
a
primary
concern
of
his
immediately
if
the
only
way
that
the
state
can
get
to
the
point
at
which
it
can
impose
multiple
punishments
for
the
same
offense
is
through
successive
prosecutions,
and
i
suggest
that
that's
what
happened
here.
there
is
no
such
thing,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court,
as
a
fair
trial
on
a
jeopardy
barred
offense.
any
trial
on
a
jeopardy
barred
offense
is
an
unfair
trial.
that
decision
has
been
made
by
the
incorporation
of
the
clause
in
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution.
it
is
a
decision
which
this
court
has
said
is
based
on
grounds
not
open
to
judicial
examination.
when
they
prosecuted
him
the
second
time
on
the
same
offense
they
violated
his
double
jeopardy
rights.
that
trial
was
inherently
unfair
to
him.
and
fairness
in
terms
of
evidentiary
considerations
is
not
at
issue
here.
i
respectfully
request,
accordingly,
of
the
court
that
the
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
which
has
ordered
nothing
more
than
the
granting
of
the
writ,
be
affirmed
and
that
if
this
man
is
to
be
tried,
if
this
man
is
to
be
prosecuted
on
a
murder
offense,
that
that
prosecution
take
place
consistent
with
the
rights
protected
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
