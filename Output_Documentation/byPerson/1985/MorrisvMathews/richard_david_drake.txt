mr.
richard
david
drake
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is,
under
what
circumstances
a
jeopardy
barred
criminal
conviction
may
be
modified
to
that
of
a
lesser
and
included
offense
which
is
not
jeopardy
barred.
it
is
submitted
that
such
a
remedy
is
available,
unless
the
defendant
alleges
and
demonstrates
that
evidence
otherwise
inadmissible
in
a
trial
for
the
lesser
and
included
offense
was
presented
to
the
tryer
of
fact
during
the
course
of
the
jeopardy
barred
trial,
and
that
such
evidence
resulted
in
actual
prejudice
to
the
defendant.
a
conviction
can
thus
be
modified,
unless
a
defendant
specifically
identifies
the
claimed
inadmissible
evidence
and
demonstrates
its
prejudicial
impact.
such
cases
are
analogous
to
the
spillover
prejudice
that
arises
in
misjoinder
of
offense
cases.
whereas
here,
the
same
evidence
would
have
been
admitted
in
a
trial
for
the
lesser
and
included
offense,
as
what
is
admitted
during
the
jeopardy
barred
trial,
a
per
se
rule
of
automatic
reversal
can
only
serve
to
force
the
defendant
and
the
prosecution
to
yet
a
third
proceeding.
mr.
richard
david
drake
in
the
case
before
the
court,
all
the
evidence
would
be
admissible
had
the
respondent
in
this
case
been
indicted
for
murder;
in
other
words,
had
the
prosecution
not
sought
the
enhanced
penalty,
and
we
are
talking
here
about
an
enhanced
penalty
case,
the
evidence
would
have
been
identical.
mr.
richard
david
drake
in
the
brief
of
the
respondent
before
this
court,
he
fails
to
identify
one
iota
of
evidence
that
came
in,
in
the
jeopardy
barred
trial,
that
would
not
have
come
in
in
the
murder
trial.
i
believe
perusal
of
his
brief
demonstrates
such.
he
does
not
identify
one
shred
of
testimonial
or
physical
evidence
that
was
presented,
and
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
this
case
was
not
tried
in
a
vacuum.
the
very
motive
for
the
homicide
was
to
cover
up
the
bank
robbery,
by
the
respondent's
own
admission.
in
other
words,
but
for
the
commission
of
the
bank
robbery,
the
homicide
would
never
have
occurred.
an
analysis
of
the
facts
of
the
instant
case
demonstrates
the
remedial
action
taken
by
the
ohio
appellate
court
was
wholly
consistent
with
the
double
jeopardy
clause
and
the
due
process
clause.
it's
undisputed
that
respondent
and
his
accomplice
robbed
a
federally
insured
bank
at
gunpoint.
during
the
opening
statements
at
the
trial
in
question,
the
defense
attorney
informed
the
jury
that
defense
did
not
contest
the
fact
that
the
respondent
was
a
participant
in
the
bank
robbery.
upon
exiting
the
bank
the
witness
saw
a
vehicle
and
reported
the
license
number,
and
a
high
speed
chase
immediately
ensued.
the
chase
ended
when
the
respondent
and
his
accomplice
went
to
a
farmhouse
in
order
to
take
hostages.
they
were
unsuccessful
in
this
endeavor.
the
house
was
completely
surrounded
by
various
law
enforcement
officers
from
a
variety
of
jurisdictions.
two
shots
were
heard
in
the
home,
at
which
time
respondent
exited.
the
accomplice
was
found
dead,
having
suffered
a
fatal
blow
to
the
heart
at
point-blank
range
with
a
sawed
off
single
shot
shotgun.
respondent
was
taken
into
custody
and
gave
a
series
of
statements.
his
initial
statement
to
the
police
was
made
under
oath
and
reported
by
a
stenographer.
he
therein
stated
that
he
had
been
kidnapped
by
the
accomplice,
and
that
both
his
life
and
that
of
his
girlfriend
had
been
threatened.
therefore,
he
participated
unwillingly.
that
very
evening
agents
of
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
arrived
and
respondent
conceded
that
he
was
in
fact
a
willing
participant
in
the
bank
robbery.
he
did,
however,
deny
having
shot
the
accomplice.
the
following
day
respondent
was
taken
and
given
a
polygraph
examination
which
he
passed.
he
later
made
a
statement
to
the
police
wherein
he
admitted
he
had
fixed
the
test
by
crossing
his
toes
and
otherwise
making
efforts
to
fool
the
polygraph.
inexplicably
the
initial
coroner's
report
ruled
the
cause
of
death
to
be
suicide,
a
rather
startling
report
which
proved
to
be
wholly
erroneous.
the
coroner
indicated
that
shots
had
come
from
a
high
powered
rifle.
it's
undisputed
that
they
came
from
the
same
saved-off
shotgun.
the
respondent
was
indicted
only
for
the
bank
robbery
and
promptly
entered
a
plea
of
guilty.
two
days
thereafter,
while
in
the
county
jail,
respondent
asked
to
speak
with
the
investigating
officer.
that
request
was
granted.
for
the
first
time
the
respondent
admitted
having
murdered
his
accomplice.
a
verbatim
transcript
of
the
respondent's
handwritten
statement
is
included
in
the
joint
appendix
at
pages
5
and
6.
of
material
import,
respondent
said,
and
i
quote,
"i
said
to
myself
real
quick
that
if
he
was
dead
i
could
say
that
i
was
kidnapped
and
they
couldn't
prove
that
i
robbed
the
bank.
"
respondent
later
gave
a
tape
recorded
confession
where
he
reiterated
his...
the
reason
for
the
homicide
to
cover
up
the
bank
robbery,
escape
culpability,
and
perhaps
return
and
recover
the
$15,000
in
stolen
money
which
he
had
hidden.
after
his
confession
respondent
was
indicted
for
what
is
called
aggravated
murder,
which
is
that
he
did
purposely
cause
the
death
of
another
and
the
aggravating
circumstance
here
being
that
of
fleeing
from
an
aggravated
or
armed
robbery,
the
distinction
between
simple
murder,
which
is
the
highest
level
of
homicide
in
ohio,
and
aggravated
murder
is
that
the
ohio
general
assembly
has
made
a
legislative
judgment
that
a
murder,
an
intentional
killing
committed
under
certain
circumstances,
here
while
fleeing
a
bank
robbery,
warrant
enhanced
punishment.
while
the
aggravating
factor
here,
the
bank
robbery,
is
an
element
of
the
crime
it
is
not
a
lesser
included
offense,
and
the
trial
judge
would
err
were
he
to
instruct
you
on
the
bank
robbery
itself.
mr.
richard
david
drake
your
honor,
at
the
time
they
did
not
know
that.
they
were
confronted
with
a
coroner's
report
which
was
wholly
erroneous,
which
ruled
the
cause
of
death
suicide,
and
they
also
were
confronted
with
the
fact
that
he
had
taken
and
passed
a
polygraph
examination,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
david
drake
the
forensic
pathologist
from
cincinnatti,
ohio,
had
forwarded
his
findings
to
the
prosecutor,
that's
correct.
they
were
aware
that
the
coroner's
factual
assessment
was
incorrect.
they
were
not,
obviously,
aware
that
his
conclusions
vis-a-vis
suicide
is
incorrect.
the
conclusion
stood,
and
they
were
also
faced
with
someone
who,
a
day
after
the
commission
of
the
act,
had
passed
this
polygraph
test,
albeit
he
had
fooled
the
operator
and
later
conceded
such.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
later
took
a
stipulated
polygraph
examination
and
failed
it
quite
miserably
when
he
was
not
allowed
to
cheat.
mr.
richard
david
drake
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
david
drake
yes,
that
was
a
concession
that
was
made.
for
purposes
of
this
argument,
that
concession
is
made,
although
in
light
of--
mr.
richard
david
drake
--no,
in
light
of
garrett
versus
united
states,
there's
much
to
be
said
for
the
proposition
that
this
is
not
a
double
jeopardy
violation.
however,
again
for
purpose
of
this
argument
it's
presupposed
that
there
was
a
double
jeopardy
violation,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
david
drake
the
case
before
this
court
is
one
of
remedy,
at
this
juncture.
mr.
richard
david
drake
yes.
upon
remand
from
this
court,
it
was
never...
the
spillover
prejudice
argument
was
presented
for
the
first
time
in
the
federal
circuit
court.
it
wasn't
even
presented
to
the
district
court,
your
honor.
i
rather
vehemently
objected
to
bringing
it
up
at
that
juncture,
but
as
the
court
below
indicates
in
a
footnote
they
found
my
arguments
to
be--
mr.
richard
david
drake
--your
honor,
i
honestly
do
not
know
if
there
was
additional
briefing
or
additional
argument.
mr.
richard
david
drake
most
assuredly,
had
the
issue
been
raised
the
ohio
appellate
court
would
have
been
forced
to
make
that
assessment.
as
i
indicated,
it
was
not
raised
before
the
ohio
appellate
court.
mr.
richard
david
drake
i
really
do
not
know,
your
honor,
correct.
i
do
know
that
the
issue
wasn't...
they
certainly
had
the
chance
to
raise
it
in
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
and
did
not.
mr.
richard
david
drake
and
they
had
the
chance
to
raise
it
in
the
federal
district
court
and
did
not,
and
in
the
first
instance
raised
it
in
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
had
they
raised
it,
they
certainly
abandoned
it
rather
expeditiously.
as
i
indicated,
it
is
briefed
before
this
court,
the
respondent
does
not
articulate
so
much
as
one
piece
of
evidence
that
was
admitted
in
the
enhancement
homicide
trial
that
would
not
have
been
admitted
in
a
trial
for
so-called
simple
murder.
in
such
circumstances,
to
mandate
that
both
the
prosecution
and
the
defense
suffer
yet
a
third
proceeding
is
not
only
not
commensurate
with
the
double
jeopardy
values,
but
actually
frustrates
the
very
value
of
finality.
the
prohibition
against
the
second
prosecution,
subsequent
to
an
earlier...
for
the
same
offense,
subsequent
to
an
earlier
conviction,
is
grounded
upon
an
analysis
that
you
want
to
prevent
both
prosecutorial
overreaching,
bad
faith,
there
is
no
allegation
of
that
here,
and
you
want
to
promote
finality.
any
precept
of
finality
has
been
totally
undermined
in
this
case.
the
remedy
is
clearly
commensurate...
the
remedy
of
the
ohio
appellate
court
is
clearly
commensurate
with
perceived
violation.
what
the
respondent
wants
this
court
to
do
is
apply
a
due
process
analysis
which
is
akin,
identical
if
you
will,
to
the
analysis
used
in
misjoinder
of
offense
cases
where
we're
talking
about
a
state
court
conviction,
the
accused
defendant,
the
convicted
defendant,
must
demonstrate
actual
prejudice.
mr.
richard
david
drake
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
chapman
is
engraved
in
granite
for
all
constitutional
violations.
for
instance,
were
this
a
violation
of
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
clause
of
the
eighth
amendment,
surely
the
conviction
would
not
be
reversed
but
the
sentence
reduced.
were
this
a
sixth
amendment
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
case,
there
is
a
rule
of
automatic
or
per
se
reversal
on
such
a
demonstration.
in
this
instance
the
supposed
violation
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
was
remedied
when
the
defendant
was
placed
in
the
position
that
he
should
have
been.
the
proceeding
itself
should
not
have
occurred.
i
would
note
that
respondent
here
did
not
endeavor
to
take
an
interlocutory
appeal
once
the
trial
judge
overruled
his
motion
to
quash
the
indictment,
which
could
have
in
theory
at
least
prevented
this
entire
difficulty.
mr.
richard
david
drake
no.
the
standard
that
is...
as
we
suggest,
and
i
believe
is
the
appropriate
standard,
is
that
used
for
misjoinder
of
offenses
which
is
that
the
accused,
the
respondent
here,
must
articulate
with
specificity
those
items
of
evidence
that
were
admitted
that
were
otherwise
inadmissible,
and
must
demonstrate
actual
prejudice
as
a
result
of
that
admission.
mr.
richard
david
drake
that's
correct,
because
we're
essentially
talking
about
a
due
process
rather
than
a
double
jeopardy
analysis.
the
double
jeopardy
clause
that
he...
what
the
respondent
endeavors
to
do
here
is
to
garner
relief
from
the
double
jeopardy
clause
when
he's
already
been
afforded
that
relief.
he
can
take
that
extra
step.
if
he
can
demonstrate
that
evidence
was
admitted,
and
that
evidence
resulted
in
actual
prejudice
to
himself,
then
the
conviction
must
be
vacated
and
he
must
be
afforded
a
new
trial.
this
case
is
very
much
akin
to
the
resolution
that
this
court
made
in
benton
versus
maryland.
unfortunately...
fortunately
that
case
came
upon
direct
review
and
the
conviction
which
was
alleged
to
have
been
tainted
as
a
result
of
this
spillover
prejudice
was
remanded
to
the
state
judiciary
for
review
in
light
of
the
state's
evidentiary
principles,
which
is
the
common
sense
approach.
here,
what
the
petitioner
wants
to
do...
this
is
unlike
a
typical
constitutional
violation,
a
griffin
violation,
search
and
seizure
violation,
where
the
violation
of
the
constitution
itself
is
concrete,
identifiable,
and
is
the
issue
before
the
court.
what
the
respondent
wants
to
do
is
take
an
entire
trial
that
might
span
weeks
and
look
to
mere,
simple
state
evidentiary
principles,
materiality,
hearsay,
et
cetera
and
ask
the
federal
judiciary
to
get
involved
in
an
ad
hoc
analysis
of
whether
or
not
the
state
judiciary
would
have
made
the
same
evidentiary
rulings.
this
court
has
never
taken
that
draconian
step
and
there
is
absolutely
no
precedent
for
that,
and
again
i
would
indicate
that
this
case
is
a
benton
versus
maryland
spillover
prejudice
type
case.
to
reverse
this
conviction,
as
i
stated
earlier,
would
serve
no
useful
purpose.
the
remedy
here,
afforded
to
the
respondent
years
ago,
is
commensurate
with
the
violation.
if
the
respondent
can
take
the
extra
step
and
indicate
that
he
was
prejudiced
by
having
to
defend
the
greater
charge,
so
be
it.
he
does
not
articulate
one
item
of
evidence
that
came
in
that
otherwise
wouldn't
have
come
in.
unless
the
court
has
questions
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
richard
david
drake
very
briefly,
your
honor.
i
simply
wish
to
emphasize
as
this
court
has
ofttimes
stated
that
the
remedy
should
be
commensurate
with
the
scope
of
the
perceived
violation.
here
the
state
of
ohio
has
forever
lost
the
enhanced
penalty
which
it
initially
obtained.
neither
in
his
brief
nor
in
his
argument
before
this
court
has
the
respondent
articulated
one
concrete
piece
of
testimony
or
physical
evidence
which
came
in
at
the
trial
which
would
not
have
come
in
on
a
trial
for
simple
murder,
and
for
that
matter
will
not
come
in,
if
there
is
a
trial
for
simple
murder,
and
yet
a
third
prosecution.
what
the
respondent
endeavors
to
do
here
is
simply
punish
the
government
for
making
a
mistake
in
a
very
unsettled
area
of
constitutional
jurisprudence.
his
supposed
remedy
subjects
both
the
respondent
and
the
prosecution
to
yet
a
third
trial
proceeding
to
no
useful
end
whatsoever.
does
the
court
have
questions?
mr.
richard
david
drake
i
believe
counsel
for
respondent
is
correct,
that
the
decision
he
cites,
the
report
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
had
not
been
cited
at
that
time.
but
the
case,
state
versus
thomas,
someone
has
to
do
this
in
the
first
instance
and
this
court
had
indicated
that
interlocutory
appeals
were
going
to
be
allowed
in
the
area
of
double
jeopardy
jurisprudence
on
a
non-frivolous
claim.
there
was
not
a
reported
decision,
but
there
certainly
was
no
reported
decision
that
says
you
cannot
do
it,
also
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
david
drake
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
has
happened
as
of
the
time
of
this
case.
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit,
pokk
versus
herkimer.
mr.
richard
david
drake
correct.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
court's
remand
in
light
of
illinois
versus
vitale
would
have
presumably
occurred
at
the
same
time
and
we
could
have
avoided
this
entire
difficulty.
the
prohibitions
against
the
actual
trial
itself,
and
the
only
way
that
one
can
truly
protect
that,
is
to
allow
the
interlocutory
appeal.
