mr.
ronald
h.
surkin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
philadelphia
inquirer
argues
that
every
private
figure
libel
plaintiff
in
every
case
to
which
the
rules
of
gertz
v.
robert
welch
applies
must
have
the
burden
of
proving
falsity
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law,
and
that
a
140
year
old
pennsylvania
rule
codified
by
statute
which
places
the
burden
of
proving
truth
on
the
defendant
is
therefore
unconstitutional.
its
contention
is
not
supported
by
history
or
precedent
or
policy.
the
issue
of
truth
or
falsity
is
very
different
from
the
issue
of
fault.
the
two
are
not
intertwined.
the
proper
balance
between
the
fundamental
societal
interests
in
free
press
and
protection
of
private
reputation
will
not
be
achieved
if
in
addition
to
proving
fault
the
private
figure
libel
plaintiff
is
required
to
prove
that
the
defamatory
statements
publicly
made
about
him
are
untrue.
since
1790
the
pennsylvania
constitution
has
explicitly
provided
that
the
rights
of
acquiring,
possessing
and
protecting
reputation
are
inherent
and
indefeasible
rights,
just
as
are
those
of
enjoying
and
protecting
life,
liberty
and
property.
the
constitution
also
provides,
and
i
quote,
"every
man
for
an
injury
done
him
in
his
lands,
goods,
person
or
reputation
shall
have
remedy
by
due
course
of
law.
"
based
upon
these
important
pennsylvania
constitutional
provisions,
the
pennsylvania
superior
court
in
1898
in
the
case
of
commonwealth
v.
swallow,
held
that
the
rights
of
the
publisher
and
of
the
person
defamed,
and
again
i
quote,
"rest
on
the
same
constitutional
ground
and
demand
an
exact
balance
of
the
scales
of
justice.
"
the
balance
of
rights
which
had
existed
in
pennsylvania,
that
is,
between
free
press
and
protection
of
private
reputation
which
is
required
by
the
pennsylvania
constitution,
was
seriously
upset
by
the
ruling
of
the
trial
court
in
this
case
declaring
that
the
pennsylvania
statute
placing
the
burden
of
proving
truth
on
the
defendant
was
unconstitutional.
it
was
unnecessary
for
the
trial
court
to
have
done
that
because--
mr.
ronald
h.
surkin
--yes,
sir.
mr.
ronald
h.
surkin
no,
sir.
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
i
believe
in
an
earlier
case,
in
1885...
it
didn't
say
it
in
exactly
the
same
language,
but
it
was
a
case
called
meese
v.
jackson,
which
is
185
pennsylvania
12,
an
1898
case
also,
said
that
reputation
is
in
the
same
class
of
rights
with
life,
liberty
and
property.
now,
the...
that--
mr.
ronald
h.
surkin
--yes,
sir,
it
hadn't
come
up,
quite
frankly.
the
issue
had
never
arisen
since
then.
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
in...
during
the
1970s
in
two
other
cases
has
relied
upon
this
pennsylvania
constitutional
provision
for
certain
explicit
reasons.
one
is
in
a
case
called
moyer
v.
phillips,
a
1975
case,
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
rules
that
the
right
of
defamation,
to
claim
a
cause
of
action
of
defamation,
must
survive
the
death
of
either
the
plaintiff
or
the
defendant
because
the
cause
of
action
of
defamation
is
protected
by
the
pennsylvania
constitution
and
stands
on
the
same
basis
with
other
causes
of
action.
there
was
another
case
in
1978
where
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
was
ruling
on
an
issue
where
somebody
was
illegally
committed
to
a
mental
institution,
and
when
that
person
was
found
that
the
commitment
was
illegal,
and
then
that
person
petitioned
to
have
the
records
of
his
commitment
destroyed,
and
the
court
held
that
because
the
right
of
reputation
is
so
important,
the
court
would
order
destruction
of
those
records.
those
to
my
knowledge
are
the
only
times
that
this
specific
provision
has
been
construed
by
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court.
so
the
question
i
think
that
we
have
to
face
here
is
whether
the
rule
of
gertz,
which
says
that
the
states
may
not
impose
liability
without
fault,
also
means
that
the
private
plaintiff
must,
in
addition
to
proving
fault,
prove
falsity,
and
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
an
unequivocal
no.
falsity
can
be
proved
without
resort
to
proof
of
fault,
and
fault
can
be
proved
without
resort
to
evidence
of
falsity.
the
two
are
not
intertwined.
mr.
marion
gave
the
example
that
i
have
in
my
brief
of
what
i
call
the
lucky
reporter,
and
i
think
that's
an
important
example
to
keep
in
mind.
it
shows
how
the
two
issues
are
very
separate
from
each
other,
and
i
think
going
beyond
that
point,
we
have
a
question
of
whether
the
court
wants
to
create
rules
that
might
encourage
the
reporter
to
act
like
this
lucky
reporter.
we
could
very
well
have
a
situation
where
a
reporter
does
what
the
reporter
did
in
my
case,
and
the
reporter
happens
to
be
working
for
the
new
york
times
or
the
philadelphia
inquirer,
the
two
most
important
newspapers
in
their
respective
cities,
each
of
which
have
a
substantial
amount
of
credibility
within
their
communities.
in
pennsylvania
we
have
an
extremely
broad
shield
law,
as
has
been
indicated.
if
it
turns
out
that
the
private...
that
that
report
is
untrue,
the
private
plaintiff
gets
on
the
witness
stand
and
he
says
i
didn't
pay
that
bribe,
or
perhaps
the
public
official
gets
up
and
he
says
i
never
accepted
the
bribe,
that
would
be
the
only
evidence
that
we
could
put
forth
in
that
type
of
case.
the
reporter
gets
on
the
stand
and
says
i
have
a
confidential
source,
an
extremely
reliable
confidential
source
in
city
government
who
i
have
relied
upon
dozens
of
times
in
the
past,
and
he
told
me
that
the
bribe
had
been
paid
and
he
saw
the
money
change
hands.
i
can't
tell
you
who
it
is
because
it's
a
confidential
source,
but
i
can
tell
you
that
he's
extremely
reliable.
in
that
type
of
a
case,
when
the
jury
retires,
they
have
mr.
nobody
literally,
on
one
side,
a
private
person
saying
i
didn't
pay
the
bribe,
although
he
did
get
the
variance,
the
fact
is
he
got
the
variance,
and
the
reporter,
backed
by
the
credibility
of
his
newspaper
on
the
other
side--
mr.
ronald
h.
surkin
--the
pennsylvania
shield
law,
your
honor,
has
been
construed
to
apply
to
any
information
or
any
source
which
the
reporter
has
chosen
not
to
publish.
it
is
an
extremely
broad
construction
of
our
shield
law
by
our
pennsylvania
supreme
court.
if
the
reporter
has
information
which
he
chooses
not
to
publish,
he
cannot
be
compelled
to
disclose
the
nature
of
that
information,
nor
can
he
be
compelled
to
disclose
the
identity
of
any
sources,
nor
can
he
be
compelled
to
disclose
the
existence
of
any
documents
he
might
have.
and
by
the
way,
it
doesn't
matter
if
those
sources
are
considered
to
be
confidential
in
pennsylvania.
in
other
words,
the
reporter
did
not
have
to
promise
his
source
that
you
will
give
me
this
information
on
a
confidential
basis.
it
is
entirely
within
the
reporter's
discretion
in
pennsylvania,
and
this
is
the
way
our
supreme
court
has
interpreted
our
shield
law,
and
it
applies
in
every
type
of
legal
proceeding,
whether
that
be
criminal,
civil
or
administrative,
and
even
legislative,
it
seems.
mr.
ronald
h.
surkin
well,
it
was
important
in
the
sense
that...
of
the
example
that
i
gave,
we
have
a
situation,
we
are
assuming
a
situation
where
the
reporter
had
no
source,
he
made
it
up.
but
then
he
gets
on
the
witness
stand
and
he
says
he
did
have
a
very
reliable
source,
and
because
of
the
shield
law,
there
is
no
way
to
disprove
that.
it
can't
be
challenged.
that's
my
point.
we
can't
get
beyond
that
shield
law
to
take
additional
discovery
to
find
out
if
he
did
have
a
source,
and
if
he
did
have
a
source,
whether
the
source
really
said
that.
mr.
ronald
h.
surkin
i
believe
that
that's
a
possible
decision,
conclusion
that
this
court
could
come
to
in
this
case,
that
in
those
states
that
do
have
shield
laws,
it
would
be
unconstitutional
and
an
improper
balance
of
the
rights
to
put
the
burden
of
proving
falsity
on
the
plaintiff,
but
i
don't
believe
that
the
court's
decision
should
be
based
upon
that
because
i
believe
under
gertz
and
the
other
decisions
of
the
court
since
gertz
that
entire
area
should
be
left
to
the
states
to
balance
as
they
see
fit,
as
long
as
they
do
not
impose
liability
without
fault.
now,
the
proof
of
fault
that
i
was
talking
about
before,
fault
focuses
on
how
the
reporter
developed
his
story,
and
how
his
editors,
on
reviewing
a
potentially
defamatory
story,
satisfied
themselves
that
the
reporter
had
a
reasonable
basis
for
believing
that
what
he
wrote
was
true.
we
are
talking
here
about
who
and
what
were
the
sources.
were
the
sources
credible?
why
were
they
credible?
did
the
reporter
get
both
sides
of
the
story?
did
the
reporter
bother
to
interview
the
person
he
was
about
to
defame?
was
it
a
hot
news
piece
or
was
it
an
investigative
piece?
were
there
confidential
sources
relied
upon,
and
if
so,
was
their
information
confirmed
or
confirmable?
we
might
have
expert
testimony
from
a
journalist
saying
what
a
reasonable
journalist
in
the
community
would
have
done
by
way
of
investigation
under
the
circumstances.
none
of
that
evidence
involves
evidence
of
falsity.
evidence
of
falsity
i
think
is
entirely
distinct
from
that.
essentially,
it
will
come
out
either
by
the
plaintiff
or
his
witnesses
testifying
directly
and
producing
documents
that
can
show,
depending
on
the
type
of
defamatory
statement
involved,
that
can
show
directly
that
the
statements
were
untrue.
or
it
might
just
be
the
plaintiff
and
his
witnesses
taking
the
stand
and
denying
the
allegations
in
the
story,
which,
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
is
essentially
what
could
be...
the
best
that
could
be
done
in
this
case,
to
deny
that
one
is
connected
with
organized
crime.
you
can't
very
well
subpoena
the
membership
lists
of
organized
crime--
mr.
ronald
h.
surkin
--i
think
in
a
public
figure
case,
your
honor,
the
burden
of
proving
falsity
is
on
the
plaintiff,
and
i
think
because
in
that
case
the
issue
of
falsity
is
inextricably
intertwined
with
the
issue
of
actual
malice.
you
have
to
prove
what
the
reporter
actually
knew
and
that
he
knew
something
different
than
what
he
published.
mr.
ronald
h.
surkin
i
think
clearly
they
can
be
separated,
your
honor,
and
i
would
also
say
that
a
jury
can
separate
them
because
i
think
if
special
interrogatories
were
submitted
to
a
jury
and
you
submitted
the
issue
of
falsity
to
the
jury
and
negligence
to
the
jury,
and
the
jury
found
falsity
but
not
negligence,
or
vice
versa,
i
don't
believe
a
court
would
overturn
that
as
being
inconsistent.
i
could
easily
see
a
situation
where
a
jury
found
that
the
plaintiff's
witnesses
were
more
credible
than
the
defense
witnesses.
mr.
ronald
h.
surkin
the
plaintiff
claiming
that
they're
true
or
false,
sir?
mr.
ronald
h.
surkin
yes.
mr.
ronald
h.
surkin
that's
correct.
he
could...
a
plaintiff
could
conceivably
prove
his
case
in
that
way
in
pennsylvania.
mr.
ronald
h.
surkin
well,
i
think
as
a
practical
matter,
your
honor,
most
plaintiffs
will
try
to
prove
falsity.
mr.
ronald
h.
surkin
if
they
can,
on
their
side
of
the
case,
rather
than
waiting
for
rebuttal.
mr.
ronald
h.
surkin
that's
right,
and
that
makes
a
big
difference,
your
honor.
i
think
it
makes
a
big
difference
in
a
trial,
it
makes
a
big
difference
in
the
balance
of
rights
in
the
close
cases,
as
i
agree,
mr.
marion
points
out
that
it
does
make
a
difference,
and
that's
what
we
are
arguing
about
here,
but
it
makes
a
difference
because
of
the
rights
that
we
are
balancing
here.
that's
the
decision
that
the
court
has
decided
to
make.
what
gertz
involves
is
an
issue
of
balancing
the
rights
of
free
speech
and
free
press
with
the
rights
of
the
individual,
private
reputation,
both
of
which
are
considered
to
be
important,
and
you
have
to
give
some
breathing
space
which
you
do
through
the
fault
or
the
negligence
requirement,
but
at
the
same
time,
you
have
to
give
the
plaintiff
a
fair
chance
to
prove
his
case
because
his
rights
are
important
as
well.
now,
the
fact
that
the
two...
the
two
rules,
that
there's
the
burden
of
proving
truth
being
upon
the
defendant
and
the
burden
of
proving
fault
or
negligence
being
on
the
plaintiff
is
not
logically
inconsistent,
as
evidenced
by
pennsylvania
law
itself.
we've
had
those
rules
in
pennsylvania
since
1885.
the...
in
pennsylvania,
which
has
a
libel
law
which
has
not
run
in
the
mainstream,
it
has
been
the
burden
of
the
plaintiff
to
prove
negligence
and
the
burden
of
the
defendant
to
prove
truth,
if
he
defends
on
truth,
and
he
doesn't
have
to,
but
if
he
does,
and
those
two
have
coexisted
since
1895
without
conceptual
difficulty.
i
think
my
reading
of
gertz,
that
gertz,
the
requirement
of
fault
does
not
also
require
falsity,
is
also
supported
by
the
majority
opinion
of
this
court
in
cox
broadcasting
versus
cohen
where
the
court
one
year
after
gertz
said
that
the
court
has
nevertheless
carefully
left
open
the
question
whether
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
require
that
truth
be
recognized
as
a
defense
in
a
defamation
action
brought
by
a
private
person.
now,
if
the
court
has
not
decided
that
issue
as
of
that
time,
which
was
after
gertz,
it
certainly
could
not
have
decided
that
the
plaintiff
must
have
the
burden
of
proving
falsity.
pennsylvania
libel
law,
i
believe,
represents
a
textbook
example
of
the
proper
balance
of
the
fundamental
rights
that
have
to
be
accommodated
in
a
private
figure
libel
case.
it's
structure
fits
comfortably
within
the
substantial
latitude
which
gertz
extended
to
the
states
in
fashioning
their
libel
laws.
it
maintains
a
permissible
balance
between
equally
fundamental
rights
which
are
protected
equally
under
the
pennsylvania
constitution,
and
it
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
federal
constitutional
requirement
that
the
plaintiff
prove
fault.
now,
i've
mentioned
a
few
aspects
of
the
matrix
of
pennsylvania
law,
and
i
think
it's
important
just
to
highlight
them
again.
we
have
for
a
long
time
had
the
burden
of
proving
truth
on
the
defendant
if
it's
raised
as
a
defense,
and
it
is
only
one
of
many,
many
defenses
that
a
defendant
has.
we've
had
the
burden
of
proving
fault
or
negligence
placed
on
the
plaintiff.
we
have
the
shield
law
because
the
plaintiff
has
to
sustain
his
burden
of
proving
negligence
without
necessarily
being
able
to
require
the
reporter
to
divulge
any
sources
that
he
chooses
not
to
divulge.
and
the
inquirer
in
this
case
is
asking
for
a
rule
of
general
application
where
in
some
future
case
you
may
be
faced
with
the
precise
issue
that
justice
o'connor
raised,
where
no
sources
are
disclosed,
and
it's
just
the
bare
case
of
we
had
good
sources,
we
had
reliable
sources.
we're
not
going
to
tell
you
who
they
are,
but
we'll
tell
you
they're
reliable,
and
we've
used
them
in
the
past.
and
then
you
go
and
ask
the
plaintiff
to
prove
he's
not
connected
with
organize
crime.
i
think
the
factual
context
of
this
case,
how
this
case
arose,
is
also
important
for
the
court
to
understand.
we
go
back
to
monday,
may
5,
1975
when
maurice
hepps
opened
his
copy
of
the
philadelphia
inquirer,
which
was
one
of
800,000
copies
distributed
that
day,
and
he
read
on
the
front
page
a
story,
the
thrust
of
which
was
that
he
and
his
chain
of
beer
distributorships,
thrifty
beverage,
was
tied
to
or
infiltrated
by
organized
crime.
similar
stories
repeating,
developing,
and
expanding
on
that
defamatory
theme,
appeared
four
more
times
during
the
ensuing
year.
on
september
15,
1975
the
inquirer
wrote
"federal
authorities",
who
by
the
way
they
have
refused
to
identify
to
this
day,
"federal
authorities
have
found
connections
between
thrifty
and
underworld
figures.
"
on
may
2,
1976
they
wrote
unequivocally
that
thrifty
beverage
beer
chain
had
connected
itself
with
organized
crime.
the
may
2
article
was
the
last
article.
this
lawsuit
was
filed
two
days
thereafter.
after
each
particle
was
published
mr.
hepps
telephoned
the
reporter.
he
denied
the
allegations
were
true.
he
offered
to
meet
with
the
reporter.
he
offered
to
open
his
entire
books
and
records
to
the
reporters
for
examination.
the
denials
were
never
published.
the
reporter
declined
the
invitation
to
examine
the
books
and
records.
at
trial
the
reporter,
mr.
ecenbarger
in
this
case,
said
he
saw
no
need
to
do
so
because
he
knew
in
his
own
mind
that
the
articles
that
he
had
written
were
true.
during
the
questioning,
the
cross
examination
of
the
other
reporter,
mr.
lambert,
there
was
this
exchange.
"question:
would
you
think
there
is
an
obligation
on
the
part
of
a
reporter
at
least
to
meet
and
talk
with
the
person
about
whom
an
article
has
been
written,
which
person
calls
the
reporter
and
says
what
you
wrote
about
is
untrue?
"
mr.
lambert
said
no.
he
went
on
to
explain
why.
he
said
it's
like
asking
a
man
if
he
beats
his
wife.
the
answer
is
an
automatic
no.
no
one
would
ever
admit
he
was
associated
with
a
friend
of
an
organized
crime
figure.
so,
in
other
words,
why
should
we
bother
asking?
we
know
what
the
answer
is
going
to
be
already.
so
we
won't
try
to
get
that
side
of
the
story.
mr.
ronald
h.
surkin
your
honor,
we
don't
know
who
gave
the
information.
the
inquirer
reporters
would
not
disclose
who
that
was.
they
were
sources
connected
with
the
federal
government,
and
we
don't
know
if
it
was
fbi,
we
don't
know
if
it
was
a
grand
jury
marshal,
for
example.
mr.
ronald
h.
surkin
no,
but
that
would
have
involved
having
to
call
an
enormous
amount
of
people,
your
honor,
because
we
don't
even
know
who
they
had
spoken
to.
mr.
lambert
said
he
had
a
source
in
washington
who
told
him
that.
there
was
a
grand
jury
investigation
going
on
in
philadelphia.
mr.
lambert's
source,
he
said,
was
a
source
from
the
department
of
justice
in
washington,
and
that's
all
we
knew
about
it.
it
was
a
practical
impossibility.
mr.
ronald
h.
surkin
i'm
sure,
your
honor,
that
were
we
to
subpoena
any
of
those
people,
we
would
get
objections,
motions
to
quash
those
subpoenas,
invasion
of
grand
jury
secrecy,
a
variety
of
other
things,
claims
that
we
were
trying
to
somehow
get
into
the
grand
jury
to
use
it
in
our
civil
case
or
some
other
civil
case,
and
i
think
as
a
practical
matter,
given
that
type
of
a
situation--
mr.
ronald
h.
surkin
--it
would
be
a
way,
but
it
would
be
enormously
cumbersome
and
i
think
practically
impossible
in
any
given
case,
your
honor.
now,
we
did
know
who
some
of
the
sources
were
in
this
case,
and
some
of
those
sources
came
in
to
testify,
but
we
didn't
by
any
means
know
all
of
the
sources,
and
we
didn't
know
who
we
considered
to
be
crucial
sources.
the
reporters
invoked
the
shield
law
20
times
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
20
separate
occasions
which
the
judge
supported,
and
we
don't
know
who
that
information
came
from,
whether
that
information
even
existed,
and
certainly
what
it
was.
we
do
know
in
one
case,
one
time
mr.
ecenbarger
testified
he
wrote
in
his
article
that
the
particular
state
senator
involved,
a
senator
frank
mazzei,
had
no
"visible",
the
word
"visible"
i
believe
was
in
quotes,
financial
links
with
thrifty
or
financial
ties
with
thrifty.
we
did
ask
mr.
ecenbarger
what
that
was
based
on
and
he
said,
well,
federal
authorities,
federal
authorities
thought
he
had
financial
ties
with
thrifty
but
they
couldn't
find
any.
so
he
wrote
they
have
no
visible
financial
links
with
thrifty,
and
that's
how
that
came
out.
but
that's
the
extent
of
the
information
that
we
were
able
to
get
from
the
federal
sources,
whoever
they
might
have
been.
now,
after
these
articles
appeared,
the
chain
stopped
growing.
some
stores
left
the
chain,
other
stores
lost
business.
there
was
evidence
at
trial
of
damages
exceeding
$5
million
from
this
defamation.
there
was
a
strike
force
grand
jury
investigation.
the
internal
revenue
service
audited
ten
years
of
thrifty's
records.
no
indictment
was
ever
issued
after
the
grand
jury
investigation.
the
irs
concluded
its
audit
by
determining
that
the
government
owed
thrifty
$278.
even
though
the
inquirer
published
the
fact
of
the
existence
of
these
investigations,
it
never
published
how
the
investigations
terminated.
so
when
hepps
sued
for
libel,
he
of
course
tried
to
prove
that
what
was
written
about
him
and
his
chain
was
untrue.
but
he
was
stymied
because
of
the
amorphous
nature
of
the
charges
and
because
of
the
invocation
of
the
shield
law.
now,
the
inquirer
and
its
amici
in
this
case
suggest
that
even
if
the
gertz
rule
of
fault
does
not
include
falsity,
that
the
court
should
fashion
a
new
constitutional
rule
to
give
more
protection
to
the
press
than
the
protection
that
gertz
allows,
and
we
believe
that
this
argument
fails
for
three
reasons.
it
fails
first
because
it
fails
to
give
adequate
or
sufficient
constitutional
weight
to
reputation,
which
is
also
entitled
to
protection.
it
fails
second
because
it
lacks
fundamental
fairness.
and
it
fails
third
because
there
is
no
compelling
evidence
that
the
press
is
not
adequately
protected
under
gertz.
the
court
has
repeatedly
reaffirmed
the
importance
of
individual
private
reputations
in
gertz,
again
in
dun
&
bradstreet,
on
numerous
other
occasions.
the
court
has
quoted
justice
stewart's
statement
in
rosenblatt
v.
baer
that
the
individual's
right
to
protect
his
own
good
name
is
a
concept
at
the
root
of
any
decent
system
of
ordered
liberty
and
a
basic
of
our
constitutional
system.
in
palko
v.
connecticut,
justice
cardozo
used
substantially
identical
words,
the
words
implicit
in
the
concept
of
ordered
liberty
to
describe
first
amendment
rights.
we
believe
this
is
not
a
coincidence.
the
bill
of
rights
reflects
the
concept
of
the
essential
dignity
and
the
worth
of
every
individual.
from
that
concept
there
flows
a
variety
of
rights
which
this
court
has
deemed
to
be
essential,
and
as
long
as
a
proper
balance
is
maintained
among
those
various
rights,
the
underlying
concept
of
human
dignity
will
remain
viable.
when
one
right
is...
no
one
of
these
rights
should
be
favored
without
compelling
reason
to
the
virtual
exclusion
of
any
of
the
other
rights.
with
regard
to
the
issue
of
fairness,
there
is
much
in
the
briefs
on
both
sides
on
whether
it
is
more
fair
to
have
the
plaintiff
prove
falsity,
more
fair
to
have
the
defendant
prove
truth.
i
don't
want
to
restate
those
arguments.
what
i
want
to
do
is
add
something
else
into
the
equation.
the
inquirer
is
part
of
a
powerful,
increasingly
consolidated
industry
which
has
created
a
virtual
daily
newspaper
monopoly
in
substantially
every
city
in
the
nation.
the
significance
of
that
fact
in
this
case
is
that
the
preferred
means
for
any
individual,
especially
the
private
person,
to
defend
himself
against
a
barrage
of
defamatory
statements,
that
is,
by
responding
to
words
with
words,
is
essentially
unavailable.
philadelphia
although
it
has
two
newspapers,
is
basically
a
one
newspaper
town.
philadelphia
newspapers,
inc.
owns
both
of
the
newspapers,
and
that
is
only
one
example.
the
saying
that
the
press
is
indeed
free
to
everybody
who
owns
one
is
not
without
relevance
in
this
discussion.
it
will
be
recalled
that
in
this
case,
even
though
mr.
hepps
called
the
inquirer
reporters
after
each
of
the
articles
appeared,
the
reporters
refused
to
talk
to
him
despite
his
requests,
and
they
never
published
his
denials.
on
the
issue
of
self-censorship,
i
would
submit,
which
is
raised
by
the
inquirer
in
its
brief,
i
would
submit
that
that's
not
truly
an
issue
here.
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
regardless
of
what
the
court
decides
in
this
case,
on
the
issue
before
the
court,
a
defendant
who
reasonably
believes
that
what
he
wrote
was
true
will
never
have
liability.
a
defendant
who
has
published
truth
is,
if
he
has
acted
in
a
reasonable
manner,
will
either
be
able
to
prove
truth
or
prove
that
he
had
a
reasonable
basis
for
believing
that
it
was
true.
if
he
can't
prove
either
of
those,
he
is
probably
in
the
situation
of
the
reporter
who
is
publishing
based
on
no
substantial
facts
at
all,
and
i
don't
believe
the
court
should
fashion
a
rule
that
would
encourage
that
kind
of
conduct.
those
statistics
that
are
available
would
indicate
that
the
press
has
fared
reasonably
well
under
gertz.
in
the
summer-fall
1984
issue
of
the
libel
defense
resource
center
bulletin,
it
was
found
that
of
the
few
cases
that
went
to
trial,
56
percent
of
private
figures
were
successful
versus
55
percent
of
public
figures,
and
50
percent
of
public
officials.
the
consistency
of
those
statistics
would
indicate
that
a
negligence
standard
has
not
created
an
open
season
on
the
media.
also,
at
least
as
of
mid-1974,
the
last
time
that
i
have
seen
statistics
available,
there
has
not
been
one
million
dollar
judgment
yet
affirmed
in
a
liable
case.
the
case
before
this
court
involves
a
newspaper
which
defamed
a
private
citizen
through
guilt
by
association
of
connections
to
the
amorphous
entity
called
organized
crime,
and
of
illegal
and
immoral
business
conduct.
it
did
so
without
getting
his
side
of
the
story
in
advance,
and
it
refused
to
print
or
even
to
listen
to
his
side
afterwards.
although
it
was
the
accuser,
its
lawyer
told
the
jury,
and
i
quote
from
mr.
marion's
closing
argument
to
the
jury,
"we
do
not
have
to
put
on
any
evidence.
"
"we
have
no
burden
on
us.
"
now
it
comes
to
this
court
and
it
says
ignore
the
history
of
libel
law.
ignore
the
pennsylvania
constitution
which
in
article
1,
section
1
explicitly
protects
reputation
as
an
inherent
and
indefeasible
right.
ignore
the
rights
of
the
states
under
the
ninth
and
tenth
amendments
to
fashion
appropriate
remedies
for
libel.
ignore
all
these
things
and
require
the
private
plaintiff
to
prove
that
he
is
not
guilty
of
the
charges
we
have
leveled
against
him.
ever
since
gertz,
this
court
has
consistently
resisted
efforts
to
further
constitutionalize
the
law
of
private
figure
libel.
it
has
done
so
in
proper
deference
to
the
fundamental
value
of
a
private
individual's
reputation
and
the
freedom
which
the
constitution
grants
to
the
states
in
our
federal
system
to
protect
private
reputation
through
the
experimental
laboratory
of
its
courts
and
its
laws.
explicit
in
these
rulings
is
the
understanding
that
the
need
to
protect
private
reputation
and
the
right
to
freedom
of
speech
are
themselves
inextricably
intertwined.
they
both
support
and
they
both
give
meaning
to
the
concept
of
individual
dignity.
accordingly,
absent
a
truly
compelling
showing
of
necessity
for
the
sweeping
new
rule
which
the
inquirer
is
seeking
here,
which
simply
has
not
been
made
in
this
case,
the
factors
of
policy,
history,
basic
fairness
and
interests
of
federalism
all
point
to
the
conclusion
that
the
court
should
continue
to
allow
pennsylvania
the
latitude
to
allocate
the
burden
of
proving
truth
or
falsity
in
a
private
figure
libel
case
as
it
sees
fit,
keeping
in
mind
that
whatever
it
decides
on
that
issue,
it
will
not
be
imposing
liability
without
fault.
thank
you.
