mr.
marion,
here
we
have
a
private
figure
case,
and
as
i
understand
it,
the
defamatory
statement
was
couched
in
very
broad,
general
terms,
something
to
the
effect
that
federal
investigators
have
found
connections
between
thrifty
and
underworld
figures,
something
about
that
broad.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
pennsylvania
has
a
shield
law,
as
i
understand
it,
so
that
the
plaintiff,
the
private
figure
plaintiff
here
would
be
unable
to
in
the
course
of
deposition
and
discovery
find
out
the
source
of
those
broad
allegations.
that
makes
it
a
pretty
tough
proposition
in
a
case
like
this,
doesn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if
the
allegation
were
as
broad
as
i
read
to
you,
and
in
a
jurisdiction
where
there
is
a
shield
law?
now,
how
is
the
plaintiff
going
to
disprove?
