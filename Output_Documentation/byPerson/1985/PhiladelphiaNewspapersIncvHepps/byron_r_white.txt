justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
a...
that
is
the
plaintiff's
burden
in
some
states,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
isn't
in
pennsylvania?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
normally
it
may
be
that
the
state
rules
are
that
way,
but
it
may
not
be
that
they
are
required
by
constitution,
by
the
constitution.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
that
wasn't
a
rule
of
common
law,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
it
just
said
that
there
was
a
libelous
publication,
and
that
was
it,
if
it
was--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
if
you
say
to
me
are
you
asking
us
to
abrogate
the
common
law
in
another
respect--
--well--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
it's
already
been
done.
that's
already
been
done.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
far
as
truth
being
a
defense.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i
am...
however
that
may
be,
but
we've
never
said
that
not
only
is
truth
a
complete
defense,
but
that
the
plaintiff
must
prove
falsity.
we
haven't
said
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
a
court
statement,
counsel.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
have
certainly
by...
if
there's
a...
if
there's
a
malice
requirement...
is
there
a
malice
requirement
here
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
the
negligence.
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
the
negligence--
justice
byron
r.
white
--so
you
can
negligently
lie
and
still
not
be
liable.
now,
that's
certainly
cushion,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
want
more
than
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
be...
and
get
off.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
a
pretty
good
basis,
there.
you've
got
a
50-50
chance,
and
the
public
is
surely
entitled
to
this
information
you
said.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
surkin,
if
this
weren't
a
private
plaintiff
but
a
public
figure,
what
about
the
burden
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
think
you
can
separate
the
two
in
a
private
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
a
witness...
so
the
plaintiff
and
his
side
of
the
case
is
in
a
sense
saying
all
i
have
to
do
is
just
claim
that
these
were
true,
and
i
am
favored
by
a
presumption,
and
so
his
case
goes
forward
on
the
basis
of
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--that
they're
false.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
says
they're
false,
and
i
have
a
presumption
that
they're
false,
and
he
goes
forward
on
the
basis,
if
these
statements
are
false,
there
was
negligence.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then,
if
he
hasn't
got
the
burden,
that's
probably
the
way
he
does
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
on
their
side.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
he
will
ask
for
instructions;
the
instructions
are
that
the
defendant
has
the
burden.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
fact
that
truth
was
a
defense
came
about
as
a
common
law
development.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
don't
want
that
part
of
the
common
law
to
die.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
truth
is
a
defense.
