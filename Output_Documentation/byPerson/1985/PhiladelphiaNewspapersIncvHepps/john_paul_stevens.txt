mr.
marion,
may
i
interrupt
you
for
a
moment,
mr.
marion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
this
cuts
in
the
other
direction
because
if
the
allegedly
defamatory
statement
is
that
thrifty
has
connections
with
organized
crime,
and
the
issue
is
whether...
say
there
is
no
doubt
about
the
persons
with
whom
thrifty
had
connections.
it
had
connections
with
mr.
a,
mr.
b,
and
mr.
c,
and
the
issue
is
whether
mr.
a,
b,
and
c
are
members
of
organized
crime
or
not,
and
you
have
indicated
that
the
newspaper
has
all
sorts
of
proof
on
that
issue,
but
conceivably
the
plaintiff
might
not
know.
we
might
say
yes,
i
know
mr.
a,
b,
and
c
very
well,
but
as
far
as
i
know
they
don't
have
anything
to
do
with
organized
crime.
now,
how
can
you
say
he's
better
able
to
prove
that
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
goes
to
whether
they
were
negligent
or
not.
the
question
that
we
are
talking
about,
though,
was
whether
in
fact
a,
b,
and
c
were
members
of
organized
crime,
and
who
has
more
information
on
that
subject?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
you...
everybody
admits
he
has
these
connections,
but
are
they
the
kind
that
justified
that
comment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
i'm
suggesting
that
that
kind
of
information
is
more
apt
to
be
available
to
the
newspaper
than
it
is
to
the
individual
who
may
or
may
not
read
all
this
stuff.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
all
that
seems
to
be
persuasive
to
me
of
the
point
that
you're
perfectly
able
to
discharge
this
burden
of
proof
if
it's
placed
on
you.
i
don't
see
how
that
goes
to
the
question
of
how
the
burden
of
proof
shall
be
allocated.
justice
john
paul
stevens
everybody
wants
us
to
decide
some
other
case.
we
have
to
decide
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
marion,
you
are...
it
seems
to
me
you
are
changing
your
hypothetical.
you
are
assuming
it's
true.
it
seems
to
me
the
assumption
has
to
be--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
know,
but
the
assumption
for
your
argument
has
to
be
we
really
can't
tell
whether
it's
true
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
may
be
true
and
it
may
be
false.
the
reporter
was
totally
irresponsible
in
publishing
it.
and
you're
saying
that
when
the
scales
are
equally
balanced
as
to
whether
it's
true
or
false,
you
know
it's
going
to
libel
somebody
seriously,
you
should
go
ahead
and
publish.
that's
your
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
that's
exactly
what
you
said.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
comes
to
you
as
a
client
and
says
do
i
or
do
i
not
publish
it,
and
you
say,
well,
if
you've
got
a
50-50
chance
of
proving
it's
true
you
should
publish.
