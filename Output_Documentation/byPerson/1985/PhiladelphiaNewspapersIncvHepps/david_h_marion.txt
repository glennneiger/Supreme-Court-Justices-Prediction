mr.
david
h.
marion
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
good
morning.
unlike
the
preceding
case,
this
is
a
private
individual's
libel
case,
and
also
unlike
the
preceding
case,
there
has
been
a
full
trial
and
a
jury
verdict
in
the
court
below.
when
i
say
that
this
is
a
private
individual's
libel
case,
i
hasten
to
add
that
it
also
involves
matters
of
public
concern.
the
jury
verdict
was
for
the
defendants
below.
it
was
reversed
by
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
because
the
trial
judge,
in
attempting
to
apply
this
court's
judgment
in
gertz
v.
welch
instructed
the
jury
that
the
burden
of
proving
falsity
was
on
the
plaintiff,
and
the
plaintiff
had
to
prove
both
falsity
and
negligence
in
failing
to
discover
the
truth.
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
reversed,
applying
instead
a
pennsylvania
statutory
provision
which
the
court
below
held
codified
common
law,
which
puts
on
the
defendant
the
burden
to
prove
truth
it
is
our
position,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
the
pennsylvania
statutory
scheme
constitutes
a
conscious
determination
by
the
state
to
err
on
the
side
of
punishing
truthful
speech
on
public
matters,
or
speech
that
may
be
true,
rather
than
allowing
speech
that
may
be
false
but
was
not
proven
false
to
go
unpunished.
in
other
words,
we
have
to
look
at
what
the
burden
of
proof
does
in
a
case.
the
burden
of
proof
decides
the
close
case,
and
most
libel
cases
that
are
fully
litigated,
as
was
this
one,
are
the
close
cases
on
issues
of
falsity.
the
burden
of
proof
says
if
you
have
a
case
where
the
evidence
of
truth
or
falsity
is
exactly
equal,
or
if
you
have
a
case
where
there
is
no
evidence
on
either
side
on
the
issue
of
truth
or
falsity,
if
the
defendant
has
the
burden,
the
speech
of
the
defendant
will
be
punished
even
though
it
may
very
well
have
been
true
and
has
not
been
proven
false.
it
is
this
rule
which
we
contend
turns
first
amendment
law
upside
down.
now,
why
do
i
say
it
turns
first
amendment
law
upside
down?
simply
because
in
pennsylvania
the
rule
is
instead
of
protecting
some
false
speech
in
order
to
be
sure
we
are
protecting
true
speech
that
counts,
that
matters,
pennsylvania
is
willing
to
punish
some
true
speech
that
matters
in
order
to
punish
some
false
speech.
in
garrison
and
sullivan,
this
court
clearly
held
21
years
ago
that
truthful
discussion
of
public
affairs
cannot
be
the
subject
of
criminal
or
civil
sanctions.
and
the
courts...
this
court
since
those
holdings
have
been
wrestling
with
the
problem
that
the
protection
of
truthful
speech
about
public
affairs
is
so
important
that
we
must
also
protect
some
false
speech.
that's
why
we
have
the
rule
for
a
public
figure
that
even
if
the
speech
was
false,
we
protect
it
unless
it
was
knowingly
false
or
recklessly
false.
and
gertz
says
for
a
private
figure
case,
even
if
the
speech
was
false,
we
protect
that
speech
unless
it
was
at
least
negligently
false.
mr.
david
h.
marion
that--
mr.
david
h.
marion
--well,
i
must
respectfully
take
issue
with
your
honor
on
both
premises
of
your
question.
in
the
first
place,
this
was
not
a
generalized
statement
that
was
libelous.
the
statements
were
very
specific.
the
defendant
said
that
the
plaintiff
companies
had
used
organized
crime
influences
to
approach
a
named
state
senator
and
get
him
to
influence
the
legislature
and
the
governor.
mr.
david
h.
marion
very
simple,
your
honor.
even
assuming
that
the
allegation
was
broad,
let's
say
the
allegation
was
so
broad
as
simply
to
say
the
plaintiff
had
connections
with
organized
crime,
and
we're
not
gong
to
tell
you
how
we
know,
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
that
in
that
case,
just
as
in
this
case,
in
the
court
below,
the
plaintiff
always
knows
whether
or
not
there
are
connections
with
organized
crime.
the
plaintiff
can
take
the
stand
and
testify,
as
this
plaintiff
did,
i
had
no
connection
with
organized
crime.
a
good
plaintiff's
lawyer
can
ask
him
a
series
of
questions,
how
did
you
conduct
your
business,
did
you
conduct
it
lawfully,
and
so
forth.
just
by
taking
the
stand
and
asserting
his
honest
conduct
of
business,
his
lack
of
any
connections
with
organized
crime,
as
a
practical
matter,
that
plaintiff
shifts
the
burden
of
production
of
evidence
to
the
defendant
because
if
the
defendant
sits
silent
after
the
plaintiff
comes
and
says
what
the
facts
are,
the
defendant
runs
a
very
real
risk
if
not
of
defaulting
on
the
case,
of
losing
on
the
case,
and
no
defendant
will
do
it,
and
this
defendant
didn't
do
it.
this
defendant
came
up
with
item
after
item
of
specific
information
of
what
the
connections
were.
if
you
look
in
the
record,
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
a-59,
you
will
see
a
chart
which
shows
all
of
the
connections
to
organized
crime
by
the
name
of
the
person
and
what
his
connection
was.
he
was
an
employee,
he
was
getting
consulting
funds
and
so
forth.
all
of
these
things
were
specifically
revealed--
mr.
david
h.
marion
--certainly--
mr.
david
h.
marion
--if
your
honor
please,
in
this
case
as
in
every
case,
the
plaintiff
has
broad
discovery
rights.
there
was
discovery
in
which,
even
though
there
was
a
shield
law,
all
15
sources
were
identified,
the
key
sources
were
identified,
and
the
basis
on
which
the
newspaper
reporter
said
there
were
connections
with
organized
crime
was
all
laid
out.
it
was
laid
out
in
the
articles--
mr.
david
h.
marion
--well--
mr.
david
h.
marion
--well,
in
this
case
there
was
a
pennsylvania
crime
commission
in
existence
which
spends
its
entire
existence
studying
organized
crime
and
issues
a
report
every
year.
that
report...
and
by
the
way,
this
wasn't
disputed
at
all
below--
mr.
david
h.
marion
--well,
with
discovery...
with
discovery
it
is
equally
available
to
both
sides,
and
it
was
in
this
case,
and
the
plaintiff,
by
the
plaintiff
saying
i
know
of
no
connections,
you
know,
i
dealt
with
a,
b,
and
c,
they're
honest
people,
they're
good
people.
i
know
of
no
connections
to
organized
crime,
that
shifts
the
burden
of
production
to
the
defendant,
and
in
this
case
the
defendant
did
come
forward
and
say
precisely
what
the
connections
were;
it's
all
in
the
record;
and
why
they
were
said
to
have
the
connections.
mr.
david
h.
marion
because
in
a
general
matter,
this
case
has
to
set
a
rule
for
all
cases,
and
generally--
mr.
david
h.
marion
--well,
if
your
honor
please,
in
this
case,
looking
only
at
this
case,
if
you
say
to
the
jury
the
plaintiff
said
i
know
of
no
connections
with
organized
crime,
the
defendant
comes
forward
and
says
here
are
the
connections,
boom,
boom,
boom,
one
after
another,
the
jury
says
i'm
perplexed.
he
says
i
have
no
connections,
the
defendant
says
these
were
connections;
what
do
i
do?
that's
where
the
burden--
mr.
david
h.
marion
--exactly,
sir,
and
every
day
in
every
tort
that
i
know
of,
whether
by
common
law
or
statute,
the
plaintiff
has
to
prove
the
elements
of
his
case
every
day.
mr.
david
h.
marion
i
don't
think
so.
res
ipsa
loquitur
has
a
rational
connection
between
you
have
to
establish
certain
facts,
that
the
defendant
was
in
control
of
the
situation,
and
therefore
it's
more
likely,
there's
some
rational
connection
between
the
facts
established
and
the
fact
presumed.
here
there's
no
rational
connection
at
all.
mr.
david
h.
marion
well,
it
depends
what
accusation
we
are
talking
about.
in
every
libel
suit,
as
in
this
one,
the
plaintiff
is
the
one
that
drives
the
defendant
into
court
and
accuses
the
defendant
of
lying.
you
liked
about
me.
that's
what
the
plaintiff's
counsel
said
to
the
jury
in
this
case.
i
will
prove
that
what
the
defendant
said
about
the
plaintiffs
was
dastardly
false.
they
lied.
mr.
david
h.
marion
the
burden
of
proof,
your
honor,
must
be
allocated
to
protect
truthful
speech
about
public
affairs.
that
is
the
essence
of
the
first
amendment,
and
if
you
say
that
if
the
evidence
is
balanced
we're
going
to
err
on
the
side
of
punishing
speech
that
may
be
true,
you
are
depriving
both
the
defendant
and
the
public
of
the
flow
of
truthful
information
about
public
affairs.
mr.
david
h.
marion
the
court...
no,
this...
the
court
has
not
ruled.
the
court
has
made
many
statements
which
i
would
regard
as
dictum,
including
justice
white's
statements
in
herbert
v.
lando,
where
he
said
in
the
old
days
the
plaintiff
had
a
presumption
of
falsity
and
the
defendant
had
to
prove
truth,
but
now-a-days,
with
gertz
and
with
sullivan
and
with
butts,
the
plaintiff
must
prove
falsity
and
a
standard
of
care
with
respect
to
that
falsity
that
was
breached.
mr.
david
h.
marion
oh,
yes.
i
think--
mr.
david
h.
marion
--that
is
correct.
mr.
david
h.
marion
well,
i
submit
to
your
honor--
mr.
david
h.
marion
--that
is
the
issue.
normally
there
are
many
procedures
which
we
would
not
say
rise
to
constitutional
level,
but
here
for
two
reasons,
both
under
the
first
amendment
and
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
burden
of
proof
on
falsity
does
rise
to
the
constitutional
level
for
this
reason:
number
one,
falsity
is
the
line
that
divides
protected
speech
from
unprotected
speech,
and
this
court
has
always
held
that--
mr.
david
h.
marion
--the
common
law
had
no
regard
for
truth
or
falsity.
mr.
david
h.
marion
that
was
it.
mr.
david
h.
marion
indeed
i
am.
mr.
david
h.
marion
i
think
it
has.
mr.
david
h.
marion
and
i
would
say
let
us
not
grieve
for
the
common
law
of
libel.
mr.
david
h.
marion
well,
i
submit
my
reading
of
your
honor's
statement
in
herbert
v.
lando--
mr.
david
h.
marion
--court's...
was
that
that
was
the
rationale
for
saying
we
must
give
the
plaintiff
discovery,
and
indeed,
the
plaintiff
does
have
broad
discovery.
so
there's
a
due...
speiser
v.
landall,
normally
it's
all
right
to
place
the
burden
of
proof
on
a
taxpayer
to
prove
that
he
doesn't
owe
the
tax,
but
in
that
case
the
burden
of
proof
was
penalizing
speech,
and
that
was
the
difference,
and
this
court
held
there
that
when
you're
determining
whether
certain
speech
falls
within
the
protected
zone
or
the
unprotected
zone,
you
cannot
put
the
burden
on
the
speaker.
the
rule
of
the
pennsylvania
court
thus
violates
that
fourteenth
amendment
rule
as
well
as
the
first
amendment
rule
that
we
must
protect
speech
that
was
true
or
that
may
be
true,
and
we
have
to
have
a
margin
of
error.
we
have
to
have
some
breathing
space.
so
we
have
to
protect
some
falsity.
now,
the...
i've
made
two
arguments--
mr.
david
h.
marion
--no,
sir.
this
is
gertz
case--
mr.
david
h.
marion
--the
lowest
level--
mr.
david
h.
marion
--of
fault,
negligence.
mr.
david
h.
marion
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
there's
a--
mr.
david
h.
marion
--we
could
negligently
lie--
mr.
david
h.
marion
--that's
true.
that's
true.
mr.
david
h.
marion
exactly,
exactly.
i
think
in
my
opponent
mr.
surkin's
brief
there's
a
beautiful
hypothetical
which
i
think
illustrates
the
issue
in
the
case.
he
says
suppose
with
absolutely
no
supporting
information
a
reporter
writes
that
a
private
citizen
bribed
a
state
official...
this
is
on
page
20
of
the
appellate...
appellees
brief,
in
footnote
9.
i
think
this
is
the
hypothetical
that's
bothering
the
court.
suppose
with
no
basis
a
reporter
says
the
plaintiff
bribed
a
state
official
to
get
a
zoning
variance.
how
did
the
reporter
come
up
with
it?
divine
inspiration,
a
hunch,
i
have
a
feeling
something's
fishy,
but
in
complete
irresponsibility
publishes
it
with
no
basis.
and
mr.
surkin
also
hypothesizes
it
happens
that
that's
true.
he
says
the
reporter
was
negligent
but
lucky.
now,
how
should
that
case
be
decided?
that
is
the
crux
of
this
case.
and
i
say
to
you
that
case
should
be
decided
for
the
defendant,
and
i'd
like
to
explain
why.
the
reason
i
say
that
is
this:
what
interests
are
we
trying
to
protect?
we
don't
care
about
that
reporter
because
he
was
worse
than
negligent,
he
was
malicious.
he
was
completely
irresponsible.
but
he
reported
the
truth.
there
was
a
bribe
of
a
public
official.
we
don't
care
particularly
about
the
interests
of
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
because
he
was
a
briber.
why
should
he
get
a
windfall
libel
recovery
simply
because
the
defendant
can't
prove
the
truth.
let
us
assume
in
that
hypo
that
just
as
the
reporter
had
no
basis
for
his
story
when
he
wrote
it,
he
has
no
basis
to
prove
the
truth
of
it
at
trial.
therefore,
there
is
no
proof
that
it
was
true.
mr.
david
h.
marion
well,
even
if
he
is
lucky,
your
honor--
mr.
david
h.
marion
--if
it's
not
true,
i
say
the
plaintiff
who
wants
to
recover
the
damages
should
prove
that
it's
not
true.
if
it
is
true
and
he
was
lucky,
i
say
that
public
interest,
forgetting
the
parties,
the
public
interest
is
that
the
truthful
information
about
governmental
corruption
should
get
out
to
the
people.
that's
what
the
first
amendment
is
designed
to
protect.
even
though
we
don't
want
to--
mr.
david
h.
marion
--that's
his
hypothetical.
mr.
david
h.
marion
exactly.
mr.
david
h.
marion
i'm
not
saying
he
should
go
ahead
and
publish.
mr.
david
h.
marion
no,
i'm
saying--
mr.
david
h.
marion
--if
he
comes
to
me
as
a
client,
i
tell
him
not
to
publish
unless
he
has
some
basis.
but
that's
not
the
hypothetical.
he's
already
published.
mr.
david
h.
marion
no.
he's
got
to
have
some
basis,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
what
50-50
means.
mr.
david
h.
marion
the
public
is
entitled
to
it.
what
i'm
saying
is
you
can't
penalize
it
if
it
may
be
true.
it's
got
to
be
proven
false,
and
the
final
argument
i
would
make
on
that
issue
is
i'd
like
to
discuss
the
relationship
between
falsity
and
fault,
which
is
raised
by
the
gertz
case,
falsity
and
fault.
we
recognize
that
it's
possible
to
isolate
falsity
and
speak
about
it
separately
from
fault.
but
the
question
we
ask
the
court,
does
that
make
sense,
is
it
rational?
and
the
way
to
decide
whether
it
makes
sense
is
to
say
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
fault
requirement
to
begin
with?
now,
justice
powell,
concurring
in
cox
broadcasting,
after
the
gertz
opinion
had
been
written,
said
that
our...
that
the
court's
opinions
dealing
with
the
first
amendment
limitations
on
state
defamation
actions
have
undertaken
to
identify
a
standard
of
care
with
respect
to
the
truth
of
the
published
facts
that
will
afford
the
required
breathing
space
for
first
amendment
values.
and
let
me
repeat
that.
what
we
are
doing,
what
this
court
has
been
doing
is
establishing
a
standard
of
care
with
respect
to
the
truth.
we
are
not
interested
in
a
standard
of
care
and
fault
in
a
vacuum.
it's
fault
in
failing
to
ascertain
the
truth
that
is
the
issue
before
the
court
in
every
libel
case,
and
that's
why
the
trial
judge's
charge
to
the
jury,
which
is
in
the
joint
appendix
in
this
case,
was
the
rational
way
for
the
jury
to
consider
these
issues,
not
to
say
that
in
such
an
intertwined
issue
as
truth
as
fault,
care
in
ascertaining
truth,
to
say
on
the
care
part
of
that
the
plaintiff
has
the
burden,
but
on
the
ascertaining
the
truth
or
the
truth,
the
defendant
has
the
burden.
that
makes
no
sense,
it's
irrational,
it
puts
too
great
a
burden
on
the
jury.
first
the
jury
should
find
whether
the
plaintiff
proved
falsity.
if
it's
not
false,
it
doesn't
matter
how
careless
or
reckless
the
defendant
was
in
the
abstract;
the
fault
we
are
interested
in
is
fault
in
failing
to
discovery
the
falsity.
and
that
is
why
i
believe
justice
white
said
what
i
think
is
obvious
in
herbert
v.
lando
that
the
plaintiff,
that
he's
got
to
establish
fault.
if
that's
the
floor,
the
threshold
for
liability
to
protect
first
amendment
rights,
then
he
must
also
establish
falsity.
falsity
is
the
essential
element
of
a
libel
case.
it's
the
dividing
line
between
protecting
speech
and
not
protecting
speech,
and
what
this
case
comes
down
to,
i
respectfully
suggest,
is
what
is
it
more
important
to
protect?
if
you
put
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
plaintiff,
some
defendants
will
go
unpunished,
even
though
they
made
false
statements
that
the
plaintiff
can't
prove
to
be
false.
that
is
unfortunate,
but
that
is
not
unconstitutional.
if
on
the
other
hand
you
put
the
burden
on
the
defendants
will
be
punished
for
making
truthful
statements
that
they
are
unable
to
prove
are
true,
and
that
is
not
only
unfortunate
but
unconstitutional
as
a
violation
of
both
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
therefore,
we
urge
this
court
to
invalidate
the
pennsylvania
statute
that
puts
the
burden
on
the
defendant
and
reinstate
the
jury
verdict
for
the
defendant
below.
mr.
david
h.
marion
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
i
reserved
a
few
moments.
mr.
david
h.
marion
i
would
like
to
face
this
issue
of
the
shield
law
directly.
there
are
two
answers
to
it.
number
one,
in
this
case
and
in
most
cases
it
is
a
completely
phony
issue.
this
is
proved
if
you
look
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
a-91.
the
plaintiff
had
a
point
for
charge
to
the
jury
in
which
the
plaintiff
set
forth
the
four
assertions
it
claimed
were
false.
none
of
these
assertions
is
amorphous,
as
mr.
surkin
says.
each
claimed
false
statement
is
detailed.
secondly,
none
of
those
four
statements
has
anything
to
do
with
confidential
sources.
there
was
no
obstacle
in
proving
the
falsity
of
them
by
the
fact
that
the
shield
law
was
involved
in
this
case.
for
example,
the
first
one
is
the
thrifty
chain
had
been
banished
by
order
of
the
court
of
common
pleas
of
lancaster
county.
that's
a
matter
of
court
record.
the
court
records
of
lancaster
county
were
put
into
evidence.
the
jury
could
decide
whether
it
was
fair
or
not
fair
to
say
that
the
thrifty
chain
had
been
banished.
there
is
no
source
issue
involved.
mr.
david
h.
marion
1937,
i
believe,
and
it's
been
re-enacted--
mr.
david
h.
marion
--it's
an
old
one.
it
has
been
re-enacted
as
recently,
i
believe,
as
1978.
and
it
was
re-enacted
after
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
gave
the
broadest
possible
interpretation
of
it.
but
i
say
to
this
court,
how
can
we
fashion
a
rule
of
federal
constitutional
law
based
on
pennsylvania
shield
law?
i
don't
think
we
can.
and
secondly,
the
issue
of
falsity
is
not
dependent
on
who
the
sources
were.
it
is
dependent
on
what
the
insertions
are
and
can
you
prove
them
false.
and
if
you
look
on
a-91,
you
will
see
all
of
these
assertions
were
provable.
and
i
ask
you
another
thing.
we
have
to
be
practical.
if
you
were
a
defense
lawyer,
would
you
rather
go
before
the
jury
and
say
i
got
this
information
from
a
source;
i
can't
tell
you
who
it
is,
or
would
you
rather
be
able
to
bring
in
the
fbi,
the
organized
crime
strike
force,
the
cia
and
so
forth
and
have
them
say
yes,
i
gave
this
information
to
this
reporter?
no
defendant
wants
to
try
his
case
and
rely
on
the
shield
law
if
he
doesn't
have
to
because
it
invites
the
argument
which
mr.
rome
made
vigorously
in
the
trial
court.
maybe
they're
making
it
up.
how
do
we
know?
and
what's
the
answer
to
maybe
they're
making
it
up?
it's
like
any
other
question
of
jury
credibility,
jury
determination
of
witness
credibility.
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
spent
80
transcript
pages
taking
every
statement
alleged
by
him
to
be
false
and
telling
what
the
truth
was,
80
pages.
the
plaintiff
in
its
case
then
put
mr.
ecenbarger,
the
reporter,
on
the
stand
for
seven
trial
days
under
cross
examination,
about
six
days
on
cross,
one
on
redirect,
seven
trial
days
the
reporter
was
on
the
stand,
and
the
jury
could
determine
the
credibility
of
the
plaintiff
and
of
the
reporter?
was
he
making
up
the
sources?
obviously
the
jury
didn't
believe
so,
and
obviously
the
key
contended
areas
of
falsity
had
nothing
to
do
with
confidential
sources,
as
you
will
see
when
you
read
page
a-91
of
the
record.
so
the
shield
law
is
a
phony
issue.
now,
the
common
law
issue,
i
made
somewhat
of
a
facetious
statement
in
my
argument
which
i
didn't
have
a
chance
to
follow
up
about
not
grieving
for
the
common
law
of
libel,
but
seriously,
the
common
law
of
libel
we
know
goes
back
to
the
days
when
we
had
an
environment
of
absolute
government,
not
democracy.
the
common
law
of
libel
was
used
to
suppress
speech,
not
to
encourage
truthful
speech
on
public
affairs
as
our
constitution
does.
the
common
law
of
libel
said
all
the
plaintiff
has
to
do
is
show
that
he's
insulted,
and
immediately--
mr.
david
h.
marion
--the
common
law
of
england
and
carried
forward
right
into
america
until
sullivan.
mr.
david
h.
marion
truth
came
to
be
a
defense
by
common
law
development
because--
mr.
david
h.
marion
--yes,
i
believe
so,
and
it
was
a
common
law
decision
that
a
plaintiff--
mr.
david
h.
marion
--no,
the
defendant
had
to
prove
truth
because
a
plaintiff
was
unworthy
to
recover
if
it
was
true.
mr.
david
h.
marion
it
came
late
in
the
common
law
development.
originally
the
saying
was
the
greater
the
truth,
the
greater
the
libel
because
libel
law
was
used
to
suppress
dissent.
mr.
david
h.
marion
to
die?
mr.
david
h.
marion
i
say
it's
not
enough
to
say
that
truth
is
a
defense
when
you're
talking
about
speech,
when
you're
putting
the
burden
on
the
speaker
to
prove
that
he's
within
the
protected
zone
of
constitutional
protection,
and
i
say
that
this
court
cannot
now
march
backward
to
the
18th
century
to
resurrect
pennsylvania
common
law
when
it
has
recognized
the
constitutional
interest
in
a
democracy
of
free
speech
on
public
affairs.
thank
you.
