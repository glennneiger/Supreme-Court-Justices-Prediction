mr.
marion,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
part
of
the
elbow
room
that
you're
talking
about?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
he
isn't
lucky
what
do
you
say?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
if
he
is
not
lucky
and
it's
not
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
surkin?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
evidence
in
this
record
negating
the
suggestion
that
federal
authorities
were
the
source
of
this,
that
is,
by
bringing
in
the
fbi
and
whoever
else
is
involved
and
having
them
state
that
they
gave
no
such
information?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
there
anything
to
prevent
you
from,
or
the
plaintiff
from
calling
the
fbi
and
the
cia
and
the
united
states
marshal
and
the
prosecutor
one
by
one
and
having
them
deny
they
ever
gave
any
such
information?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
would
be
one
way
of
proving
the
man
was
a
liar,
wouldn't
it
be,
however
cumbersome?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
you
have.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
