justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
not...
that's
not
true.
well,
to
say
that
the
plaintiff
has
to
prove
the
elements
of
his
case
is
a
truism.
the
question
is
what
are
the
elements
of
the
plaintiff's
case,
and
if
you
take
res
ipsa
loquitur
from
tort
law,
there
the
law
has
allotted
the
burden
to
the
defendant
because
the
defendant
is
in
possession
of
the
information
in
a
way
the
plaintiff
isn't,
and
it
seems
to
me
that's
pretty
much
what
your
supreme
court
held
here.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
there
a
rational...
wouldn't
it
be
rational
for
the
law
to
say
that
the
person
who
makes
the
accusation
should
have
the
burden
of
proving
it's
true
rather
than
the
person
against
whom
the
accusation
is
made
should
have
the
burden
of
proving
its
falsity?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
perhaps
that's
in
the
opening
statement,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
that's
how
the
burden
of
proof
is
allocated.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
certainly
this
court
hasn't
ruled
thus
far
on
the
point
you're
making
here.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
surkin,
do
you
think
that
the
existence
of
the
shield
law
in
pennsylvania
is
something
that
can
be
factored
into
the
federal
constitutional
equation
in
a
way
that
pennsylvania
can
allocate
the
burden
of
proof
the
way
it
has
in
this
case,
at
least
where
there's
a
shield
law,
even
though
perhaps
some
other
state
that
didn't
have
a
shield
law
might
not
for
first
amendment
purposes
be
able
to
have
the
burden
of
proof
that
way?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
imagine
you
found
a
certain
reluctance
on
the
part
of
some
of
those
sources
to
come
and
testify.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
fox's
libel
law.
wasn't
it
fox's
libel
law?
