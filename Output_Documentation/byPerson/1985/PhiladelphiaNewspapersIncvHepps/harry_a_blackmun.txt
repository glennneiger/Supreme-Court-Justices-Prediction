justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
surkin,
you
referred
to
a
decision
of
a
pennsylvania
superior
court.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
the
decision
of
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
in
this
case
the
first
time
it
has
ever
so
ruled--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--but
it
took
a
long
time
for
the
supreme
court
to
make
the
flat
statement,
didn't
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
is
said,
however,
that
the
shield
law
is
not
particularly
important
because
you
are
concerned
here
with
information,
not
source.
what
comment
do
you
have
about
that
argument?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
can
accept
all
that,
but
why
is
the
source
so
important
when
you
are
concerned
with
information,
is
my
question.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
marion,
tell
me
again,
how
long
has
pennsylvania
had
its
shield
law?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
it's
an
old
one.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
are
you
talking
about
the
common
law
of
england?
is
that
what
you're
talking
about?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
when
did...
how
did
truth
come
to
be
a
defense?
