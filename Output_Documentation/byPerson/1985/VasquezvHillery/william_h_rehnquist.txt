justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
prahl,
did
the
state
plead
as
a
defense
to
the
federal
habeas
action
that
it
was
prejudiced
in
presenting
its
defense
of
the
action
by
the
passage
of
time?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and,
the
district
court
ruled
on
that
defense?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and,
you
have
not
presented
that
issue
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
there
is
a
rule
of
exhaustion
certainly.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and,
i
think
the
rule
does
extend...
courts
have
said
on
occasion
that
even
though
the
claim
is
the
same,
if
the
evidence
adduced
in
support
of
it
is
totally
different,
then
the
claim
may
be
unexhausted.
