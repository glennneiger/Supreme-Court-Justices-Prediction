mr.
william
george
prahl
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
on
june
27,
1962,
the
kings
county
grand
jury
returned
a
true
bill
indicting
respondent
booker
t.
hillery
on
a
charge
of
first
degree
murder.
respondent
hillery
was
charged
with
murdering
a
15-year
old
girl
on
march
21,
1962.
jury
selection
for
the
guilt
phase
of
respondent's
trial
began
on
october
23,
1962.
respondent
was
found
guilty
of
first
degree
murder
and
in
another
phase
of
the
trial
the
same
jury
voted
unanimously
to
impose
the
death
penalty.
the
guilt
phase
of
respondent's
initial
trial
was
affirmed
while
the
penalty
trial
was
reversed
by
the
california
supreme
court.
mr.
william
george
prahl
yes,
your
honor.
the
crime
occurred
in
march.
the
indictment
was
returned
in
june.
mr.
hillery
received
two
subsequent
penalty
trials
after
his
first
penalty
trial
was
reversed.
the
third
penalty
trial
was
conducted
in
another
county
in
california
in
1970.
in
both
cases,
the
juries
voted
unanimously
to
again
impose
a
death
penalty.
in
all,
36
jurors
have
decided
that
mr.
hillery
deserved
nothing
less
than
death
for
the
brutal
murder
of
marlene
miller.
twenty-one
years
after
the
initial
jury
verdict,
respondent's
conviction
was
reversed
by
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
california.
following
an
evidentiary
hearing,
the
district
court
found
that
there
had
been
purposeful
discrimination
against
black
persons
in
selecting
the
grand
jury
between
1956
and
1962.
mr.
william
george
prahl
no,
your
honor.
in
the
original
return
we
did
not
plead
delay
as
a
defense.
it
was
raised
by
way
of
a
motion
when
it
became
clear
that
we
were
going
beyond
the
original
trial
court
record.
mr.
william
george
prahl
yes,
your
honor.
the
district
court
denied
our
motion
to
dismiss
in
a
published
opinion.
mr.
william
george
prahl
no.
your
honor.
we
feel
that
that
is
one
of
the
issues
that
becomes
involved
in
the
question
of
harmless
error.
in
other
words,
as
you...
the
issue
before
this
court
is
a
question
of
whether
purposeful
discrimination
in
the
selection
of
a
grand
jury
can
be
considered
harmless
error.
and,
one
of
the
factors
that
we
think
the
court
can
look
to
in
making
that
decision
is
the
passage
of
time,
the
changes
in
circumstances
that
have
occurred.
here,
again,
there
was
21
years
from
the
time
of
the
initial
jury
verdict
until
the
time
when
the
district
court
finally
issued
its
opinion.
again,
the
ninth
circuit--
mr.
william
george
prahl
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
the
passage
of
time
alone
is
the
sole
criterion.
mr.
william
george
prahl
your
honor,
in
this
particular
case,
the
passage
of
time
has
indicated
that
there
is
no
continuing
history
of
discrimination
in
the
county.
in
fact,
the
year
after
mr.
hillery
was
indicted,
a
black
person
appeared
on
the
county
grand
jury.
mr.
william
george
prahl
well,
your
honor,
we
don't
think
that
it
is
necessarily
the
case
in
this
type
of
situation;
that
the
remedy
provides
specific
relief
to
the
defendant.
what
these
kinds
of
cases
are
looking
for
is
an
overall
deterrence
effect
on
the
criminal
justice
administration
system
and
we
believe
that
where,
for
example,
the
record
indicates
that
there
is
no
continuing
history
of
discrimination,
and,
in
fact,
in
this
particular
record,
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
important
to
note
that
when
the
trial
judge
made
his
remarks,
he
indicated
that
efforts
had
begun
even
before
this
particular
challenge
had
been
made
to
locate
black
persons
who
could
serve
on
the
county
grand
jury.
so,
the
district
court's
finding
that
this
particular
motion
precipitated
a
change
may
not
be
entirely
supported
by
the
record.
in
fact
here
the
trial
judge,
who
was
dead
at
the
time
of
the
evidentiary
hearing
in
the
federal
court,
the
trial
judge,
judge
wingrove,
indicated
on
the
record
at
the
time
of
mr.
hillery's
motion
to
quash,
that
he
was
making
efforts
to
try
to
find
black
people
that
could
serve
on
the
county
grand
jury
before
the
motion
was
brought.
so,
we
think--
mr.
william
george
prahl
--1962,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
george
prahl
the
trial
judge
indicate,
your
honor,
that
he
was
looking
for--
mr.
william
george
prahl
--pardon
me,
your
honor.
mr.
william
george
prahl
i
don't
believe
he
did,
your
honor.
mr.
william
george
prahl
no,
your
honor.
what
the
trial
judge
indicated
was
that
he
was
looking
for
a
representative
cross
section
of
the
community
to
serve
on
the
kings
county
grand
jury.
he
was
especially
concerned
about
the
ability
of
the
jurors
to
serve
in
california's
grand
jury
system
which
plays
a
watch-dog
role
over
county
government.
they
oversee
the
operations
of
the
fiscal
aspects
of
county
government.
in
other
words,
it
is
not
something
that
would
come
easily
to
every
citizen
in
the
community.
but,
if
you
look
at
the
record
as
a
whole,
especially
the
transcript
of
the
trial
judge's
remarks,
it
becomes
very
clear
that
the
trial
judge
considered
black
people
to
be
qualified
and
capable
of
serving.
so,
i
think
those
factors,
the
factor
of
the
continued
history
or
the
history
of
the
county
is
one
thing
the
court
can
look
to
in
determining
whether
or
not
this
form
of
constitutional
error
requires
reversal.
harmless
error
has
been
held--
mr.
william
george
prahl
--your
honor,
we
tried
to
argue
harmless
error
to
the
district
court.
the
district
court--
mr.
william
george
prahl
--we
did
not
introduce
any
of
that
evidence,
your
honor.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record.
the
reason
why
is
because
we...
that
would
have
been
one
of
the
factors
that
we
would
have
desired
to
present
evidence
to
the
district
court
on
in
terms
of
the
harmless
error
analysis.
in
other
words,
harmless
error
in
this
particular
kind
of
case...
one
of
the
rationales
for
deciding
that
harmless
error
should
not
be
applied
has
been
this
notion
that
somehow
you
can
retry
a
defendant.
i
think
the
court
has
been
getting
away
from
that
in
morris
v.
slappy,
in--
mr.
william
george
prahl
--well,
if
the
district
court
opinion
is
affirmed,
you
mean,
and
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
is
affirmed,
your
honor?
pick
up
the
pieces
and
do
the
best
we
can.
mr.
william
george
prahl
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
william
george
prahl
well,
this
is
going
to
be
a
devastating
case
to
try
to
retry.
this
is
a
first
degree
murder
that
is
25
years
old.
the
question
of
rounding
up
the
witnesses,
rounding
up
the
evidence
are
not
the
only
questions
presented
here.
the
questions
of
what
law
applies
to
this
particular
case
is
truly
mind-boggling.
mr.
william
george
prahl
the
transcripts
are
available,
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
that
is
a
hollow
right
to
rely
on.
mr.
william
george
prahl
yes,
your
honor.
i
mean,
if
we
have
to,
the
effort
will
be
made.
mr.
hillery
is
still
confined.
no
parole
date
has
ever
been
set.
he
is
regarded
as
a
danger
by
the
state
of
california.
he
has
never
been
released.
the
record
on
the
bail
proceedings
indicates
that
state's
views
toward
mr.
hillery.
we
would
be
forced
in
that
situation
to
do
the
best
we
can.
one
of
the
problems
i
would
like
the
court
to
take
into
account
in
terms
of
the
harmless
error
rule
is
a
passage
from
the
case
of
morris
v.
slappy
where
the
court
recognized
for
one
of
the
first
instances
the
right
of
the
victims
in
these
particular
matters.
now,
this
is
a
murder
case,
but
the
court
should
be
sensitive
to
the
concerns
of
the
parents
here.
the
parents
of
this
particular
young
girl
have
had
to
endure
three
separate
trials
and
they
have
been
able
to
put
this
horrendous
experience
behind
them.
to
resurrect
this
tragedy
25
years
later,
to
take
this
family
through
this
agony
once
again,
where
time
has
had
the
opportunity
to
heal
this
wound,
we
feel
that
that
is
something
the
court
should
take
into
account
in
its
harmless
error
calculation.
the
other
thing
we
think
the
court
should
look
to
in--
mr.
william
george
prahl
--well,
your
honor,
we
think--
mr.
william
george
prahl
--no,
your
honor.
the
court
is
the
one...
again,
in
morris
v.
slappy
that
brought
this...
it
is
part
of
the
question
of
a
retrial.
it
is
part
of
the
question
of
the
public's
confidence
in
a
jury
verdict
and
in
the
finality
of
that
jury
verdict.
mr.
william
george
prahl
i
think
that
is
part,
your
honor,
of
the
rationale
behind
the
extension
of
harmless
error
to
even
constitutional
errors.
in
other
words,
the
public's
confidence
in
the
finality
of
a
jury
verdict
and
the
finality
in
the
integrity
of
the
jury
process--
mr.
william
george
prahl
--i
don't
think
error
depends
necessarily
on
time.
time
is
a
factor.
it
is
not
the
crucial
factor.
in
this
particular
case,
your
honor,
i
think
there
are
other
factors
that
are
much
more
telling
on
the
necessity
for
imposing
the
harmless
error
standard.
first
of
all,
in
this
case,
black
people
were
serving
on
trial
juries
on
a
regular
basis.
the
record
is
replete
with
that.
there
is
an
acknowledgement
in
this
case,
your
honor,
by
mr.
hillery's
trial
counsel,
the
attorney
that
represented
him
at
trial,
the
attorney
who
made
the
motion
to
quash,
that
had
this
case
been
brought
to
a
preliminary
hearing,
there
is
absolutely
no
doubt
in
his
mind
that
mr.
hillery
would
have
been
bound
over
for
trial.
that
fact,
the
fact
that
there
is
nothing
to
remedy...
the
purpose
of
the
grand
jury
as
noted
in
the
dissent
in
rose
and
in
justice
jackson's
dissent
in
cassell,
the
purpose
of
the
grand
jury
is
to
provide
probable
cause
to
determine
whether
a
trial
is
to
be
conducted.
and,
here,
even
mr.
hillery's
trial
attorney
has
acknowledge
that
there
is
overwhelming
evidence
to
support
probable
cause.
in
fact,
the
california
supreme
court
in
commenting
on
the
evidence
in
this
particular
case,
the
evidence
of
guilt,
characterized
this
case
as
being
overwhelming.
the
fact
that
mr.
hillery
received
a
full
and
fair
trial
in
front
of
a
jury,
the
fact
that
he
received
three
trials...
i
grant
the
court
that
the
second
two
trials
were
penalty
trials,
but
a
jury
deciding
whether
to
impose
the
death
penalty
must
first
obviously
be
convinced
of
the
defendant's
guilt
before
they
would
consider
imposing
such
a
harsh
penalty.
you
have
three
separate
trials.
all
of
those
unanimous
findings
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
again,
the
point
we
made
before
that
jury
discrimination
was
being
looked
to
already
by
the
superior
court
judge.
there
really
is
no
basis
for
imposing
the
kind
of
relief
or
deterrence
that
is
addressed
in
many
of
the
cases,
because
here
the
mechanism
of
change
was
already
in
place
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
before
this
court
which
suggests
that
there
is
a
continuing
pattern
or
a
continuing
history
of
discrimination.
we
think
that
in
these
kinds
of
cases
application
of
the
harmless
error
rule
would
continue
to
serve
the
significant
deterrent
interest
which
the
court
has
espoused
on
many
occasions.
in
other
words,
the
process
would
remain
the
same.
petitioner
would
be
required
to
make
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination.
the
state
would
have
the
opportunity
if
that
case
has
been
made
to
rebut
it,
then
the
trial
court
would
make
its
finding.
there
would
still
be
a
finding
of
whether
or
not
there
has
been
purposeful
discrimination.
that
finding
in
and
of
itself
is
a
significant
undertaking
for
the
judiciary.
in
other
words,
that
finding
provides
the
integrity
that
is
needed
in
these
kinds
of
cases
and
insures
the
operation
of
the
criminal
justice
system.
mr.
william
george
prahl
well,
your
honor,
to
clarify
the
point,
our
position
is
not
that
the
proof
of
the
trial
shows
there
is
probable
cause.
our
point
in
this
particular
case
is
that
mr.
hillery's
original
trial
attorney,
mr.
goodwin,
hugh
goodwin,
testified
at
the
federal
evidentiary
hearing...
he
was
asked
was
there
any
doubt
in
your
mind
if
the
motion
to
quash
had
been
successful
and
mr.
hillery
had
been
brought
before
a
preliminary
hearing
whether
he
would
have
been
bound
over
for
trial
and
mr.
goodwin
acknowledged
that
there
was
no
question
that
the
evidence
before
the
grand
jury
was
sufficient
to
indict.
mr.
william
george
prahl
that
is
certainly
true,
your
honor.
well,
it
may
or
may
not
be
true.
witnesses
may
become
unavailable
witnesses
that
have
testified
at
a...
a
crucial
witness
may
become
unavailable
and
the
state's
case
may
be
less
convincing,
as
it
were,
than
at
a
preliminary
hearing.
i
grant
you
that
that
is
a
rare
occurrence,
but
that
is
possible.
the
important
point
in
this
case
was
that
not
only
was
the
evidence
at
the
indictment
sufficient
to
show
probable
cause,
but
also
the
evidence
at
three
separate
trials
established
respondent's
guilt
beyond
any
question.
and,
as
the
california
supreme
court
noted...
the
california
supreme
court
characterized
the
evidence
as
overwhelming.
mr.
william
george
prahl
well,
the
question,
your
honor,
as
to
why
would
a
defendant
bother
to
do
this?
we
are
not
arguing
that
all
cases
be
judged
harmless
error,
but
the
court
established
an
across-the-board
rule.
what
we
are
arguing
is
that
harmless
error
be
an
option,
be
something
that
the
trial
court
has
available
to
it
to
consider
under
certain
well
defined
circumstances
and,
if
harmless
error
is
shown
to
be
true,
then
there
would
be
no
basis
for
quashing
the
indictment.
however,
if
the
defendant
can
point
to
actual
prejudice,
for
example,
if
there
is
a
continuing
history
of
discrimination,
if
you
combine
discrimination
in
the
selection
of
a
grand
jury
with
the
discrimination
in
the
selection
of
trial
juries,
so
that
there
is
a
fundamental
unfairness
in
the
trial
process,
it
may
be
that
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
apply
the
harmless
error
rule.
mr.
william
george
prahl
i
don't
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
william
george
prahl
well,
rose...
no
one
is
quite
sure
exactly
what
rose...
what
the
holding
of
the
rose
case
is
given
the
line-up,
if
you
will,
of
the
justices
in
that
case.
but,
if
the
court--
mr.
william
george
prahl
--well,
with
the
justices
voting
for
different
parts
of
the
opinion,
it
is
not...
at
least
one
circuit
judge
has
analyzed
the
case
as
saying
that
there
is
no
clear
majority
behind
the
rule
that
harmless
error
does
not
apply.
but,
the
point
we
wish
to
make,
your
honor--
mr.
william
george
prahl
--i
am
not
sure
that
there
is
a
majority
of
the
court
that
supports.
we
have
briefed
that
question.
but,
i
don't
think
that
is
crucial
to
the
outcome
of
this
case,
because
i
don't
think
rose
necessarily
involves
the
same
facts
and
if
the
court
is
of
the
opinion
that
rose
is
precedent
in
this
situation,
we
are
asking
the
court
to
overturn
that.
we
are
asking
the
court
here
to
carve
out
an
exception
for
those
situations
where...
that
would
allow
the
trial
court
to
make
a
harmless
error
determination.
again,
in
this
particular
case,
we
would
like
to
point
out
that
there
is
no
claim
of
actual
prejudice
resulting
from
the
grand
jury
indictment.
the
sole
claim
in
this
case,
and
it
is
a
significant
one...
i
don't
mean
to
diminish
the
claim...
but
the
sole
claim
here
is
that
there
was
purposeful
exclusion
of
blacks
from
1956
to
1962.
our
point
here
is
that
absent
a
showing
of
some
prejudice
in
a
grand
jury
process
where
black
people
regularly
served
on
the
trial
juries,
harmless
error
would
be
appropriate.
harmless
error,
as
i
have
tried
to
point
out,
serves
several
important
functions.
it
gives
effect
to
the
principle
that
the
essential
purpose
of
the
criminal
law
is
to
decide
factual
questions
regarding
the
defendant's
guilt
and
not
technical
questions
regarding
the
composition
of
a
pre-trial
hearing
body.
again,
in
this
particular
case,
where
you
have
three
separate
juries
voting
unanimously
regarding
the
respondent's
guilt,
you
are
seriously
eroding
the
public's
respect
for
the
criminal
justice
process.
the
public
does
not
and
has
difficulty
understanding
why
what
would
amount
to
close
to
23
years
now,
later
we
are
reversing
a
criminal
conviction
that
is
supported
by
overwhelming
evidence
where
the
trial
was
fair,
where
black
people
participated
in
the
trial
juries,
simply
because
blacks
were
excluded
from
the
grand
jury
process.
in
the
absence
of
anything
that
would
indicate
that
mr.
hillery
did
not
receive
a
full
and
fair
trial,
the
law,
as
we
see
it,
should
permit
the
trial
judge
to
engage
in
a
harmless
error
analysis.
finally,
again,
we
would
like
to
point
to
significant
changes
in
the
area
of
deterrence
which
we
feel
are
now
in
place
that
were
not
necessarily
in
place
when
this
court
considered
such
cases
as
cassell
v.
texas
and
reece
and
some
of
the
other
grand
jury
cases.
in
the
current
situation,
there
is
a
great
deal
more
public
attention
focused
on
such
types
of
claims.
the
media,
for
example,
would
surely
bring
a
claim
like
this
in
a
judicial
finding
of
discrimination
to
the
public's
attention.
there
are
civil
and
criminal
sanctions
for
discrimination.
there
are
also
public
and
private
agencies
that
are
concerned
and
are
ready
to
perform
a
deterrent
function.
all
of
these
suggest
that
deterrence
by
the
courts
by
way
of
reversing
a
criminal
conviction
are
no
longer
necessary
or
essential;
that
the
courts
can
rely
on
some
of
these
other
deterrent
mechanisms
that
are
now
in
place
and
are
now
willing
to
function
in
order
to
prevent
a
reoccurrence
of
any
form
of
discrimination.
the
second
issue
that
is
before
the
court
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
significant
change
in
the
evidentiary
basis
of
mr.
hillery's
claim
when
it
finally
reached
the
federal
court.
we
have
included
in
the
joint
appendix
the
elaborate
computer
model
that
was
set
up
to
process
information
and
spit
out
a
result
that
told
the
district
court
supposedly
the
level
of
discrimination
that
was
occurring
and
the
possibility
that
this
could
have
occurred
by
chance.
here,
there
was
actual
testimony
offered
from
citizens
of
kings
county
that
was
never
offered
in
the
trial
court.
the
trial
court's
remarks
contained
in
the
transcript
are
indicative
that
the
trial
court
felt
that
mr.
goodwin
had
simply
not
proven
his
case.
there
had
been
no
evidence
offered
on
the
size
of
the
county's
population
of
blacks
that
were
eligible
to
serve
or
the
grand
jury.
and,
this
failing
lead
the
trial
court
to
deny
the
motion.
twenty
years
later
all
of
these
failings,
these
shortcomings,
were
remedied
and
were
placed
before
the
federal
district
court.
the
ninth
circuit,
in
a
split
decision,
did
affirm
the
district
court's
order,
but
the
dissenting
judge
there
did
find
that
there
had
been
a
significant
change
in
the
character
of
that
particular
claim.
i
have
been
touristing
here
in
washington
a
little
bit
and
when
i
went
to
the
air
and
space
museum
i
saw
what
this
case
represents
to
me,
the
wright
flyer
on
the
one
hand
and
the
space
capsule
on
the
other,
and
that
is
what
this
particular
case
involved.
what
mr.
goodwin
presented
to
the
trial
judge
was
a
wright
flyer
of
discrimination
and
what
was
presented
to
that
federal
district
court
judge
was
a
space
capsule.
this
thing
had
computers
and
it
had
bells
and
whistles
and
it
did
everything.
what
we
are
suggesting
to
the
court
here
is--
mr.
william
george
prahl
--well,
what
we
are
suggesting
is
that
if
exhaustion--
mr.
william
george
prahl
--well,
if
exhaustion
is
to
have
any
meaning,
what
this
court
should
be
telling
the
district
courts
is
that
when
something
comes
in
that
is
wholly
different,
that
has
wholly
been
transformed
in
the
words
of
daniels
v.
nelson
or
presenting
a
case
in
a
significantly
different
posture
than
it
was
presented
to
the
state
court,
it
has
to
be
sent
back.
mr.
william
george
prahl
no,
i
don't
believe
it
is.
the
issue
has
never
been
raised
in
california.
but,
we
do
feel
the
issue,
as
it
was
presented
to
the
district
court,
should
have
first
been
brought
to
california
so
california
would
have
had
a
chance.
california
reviewed
it
under
the
same
meager
record
that
was
presented
to
the
trial
court
and
there
is
nothing
at
all
to
indicate
that
the
california
court
had
all
this
bundle
of
new
evidence--
mr.
william
george
prahl
--pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
william
george
prahl
yes,
your
honor,
we
did.
mr.
william
george
prahl
we
chose
to
defend
the
matter
based
on
the
state
record,
because
we
felt
that
was
what
was
proper.
mr.
william
george
prahl
on
the
new
evidence,
your
honor?
mr.
william
george
prahl
yes.
under
california's
habeas
corpus
law,
petitioner
would
be
allowed
to
make
a
case
for
presenting.
he
would
have
a
problem
though,
your
honor,
as
to
showing
why
he
had
not
presented
that
evidence
in
the
first
instance;
in
other
words,
whether
the
computer
model
is
such
that
it
would
have
been
unavailable.
but,
the
testimony,
for
example,
of
the
citizens
of
the
county,
the
black
citizens
who
testified
as
to
their
recollection
of
the
grand
jury
process,
if
they
were
available
and
they
simply
chose
not
to
present
them
in
the
state
forum
the
first
time,
there
would
be
some
doubt
as
to
whether
they
could
present
them
a
second
time.
and,
that
is
one
of
the
problems
again
with
the
federal
judge's
notion
of
the
plenary
power
of
a
federal
evidentiary
hearing.
you
can't
hold
back
evidence
out
of
a
motion
to
quash
and
then
wait
until
you
get
into
federal
court
to
come
in
and
try
to
present
that
evidence.
but,
that
would
have
to
be
argued
in
the
state
court,
but
the
power
to
hear
it
is
there.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
i
wish
to
reserve
some
additional
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
william
george
prahl
just
briefly,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
cite
to
the
court
coleman
versus
alabama
at
399
u.s.
1
which
is
a
case
involving
a
denial
of
counsel
at
a
preliminary
hearing.
i
believe
it
was
the
state
of
alabama.
in
that
case,
counsel
was
not
afforded
at
a
preliminary
hearing
and
this
court
found
there
that
that
was
a
constitutional
right
subject
to
the
harmless
error
rule
and
applied
harmless
error
to
the
depravation...
a
sixth
amendment
depravation
at
a
preliminary
hearing.
i
think
that
is
additional
authority.
i
would
like
to
address
one
remark
made
by
justice
o'connor
and
that
is
on
the
burden
of
proof.
burden
of
proof
was
clearly
on
the
petitioner
or
mr.
hillery
to
go
forward
and
it
was
a
deficiency
in
that
burden
of
proof
which
lead
to
the--
mr.
william
george
prahl
--yes,
your
honor.
he
also
had
a
burden
of
proof
on
the
issues
he
raised.
the
district
attorney...
on
joint
appendix
45,
page
45,
is
a
statistical
compilation
introduced
by
the
district
attorney
to
show
that
blacks
did
not
comprise
a
significant...
that
was
the
primary
defense
raised
here.
mr.
william
george
prahl
that
blacks
did
not
comprise
a
significant
portion
of
the
population.
mr.
william
george
prahl
yes,
your
honor.
he
also
had
the
burden
of
proving
that
there
was
the
eligible
population.
now,
that
was
what
significantly
changed
the
character
of
this
when
it
got
to
the
federal
court.
with
that
i
will
conclude.
thank
you,
your
honor.
