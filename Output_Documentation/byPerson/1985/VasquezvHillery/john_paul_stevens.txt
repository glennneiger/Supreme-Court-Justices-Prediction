justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
a
little
trouble
following
that
argument.
as
i
understand,
your
main
point
is
that
the
proof
of
the
trial
shows
that
there
was
plenty
of
probable
cause,
and,
therefore,
the
indictment...
the
fact
that
there
might
have
been
discrimination
in
picking
the
grand
jury
is
really
harmless
as
to
this
defendant.
why...
if
you
follow
that
reasoning,
why
would
one
ever
want
to
litigate
the
issue?
why
would
the
defendant
ever
raise
the
question,
just
for
future
people
to
have
a
declaration
on
the
record
of
some
kind?
i
just
don't
know.
justice
john
paul
stevens
wouldn't
that
always
be
true
if
you
later
have
a
trial
and
find
them
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
all
of
these
cases
are
cases
in
which
a
defendant
has
been
convicted
and
there
has
been
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
i
don't
know
that
the
fact
they
proved
it
three
times
instead
of
once
makes
much
difference.
