wouldn't
we
have
to
overrule
rose
against
mitchell
to
agree
with
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
certainly
seem
to
claim
that
it
has
been
eroded.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
rose
against
mitchell
really
leads
on
the
question
of
whether
harmless
error
applies
to
discrimination
in
the
grand
juries?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
want
a
non-exhaustion
ruling
so
that
there
would
be
a
chance
to
go
back
and
exhaust
in
the
state
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
much
chance
would
you
have
of
winning
in
a
state
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
california
is
racial
discrimination
in
the
grand
jury
selection
subject
to
harmless
error
analysis
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
had
a
chance
to
meet
any
submission
that
was
made?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
had
a
chance
to
meet
any
of
this
new
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
he
has
to
allege
at
least
there
has
never
been
a
black
on
the
grand
jury
or
that
the
proportion
of
blacks
is
completely
out
of
line.
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
if
there
is
an
objection...
if
there
is
a
denial
of
those
facts,
he
has
got
the
burden
of
proving
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
if
he
had
been
a
computer
expert
himself
and
in
the
course
of
deciding
the
case
had
gone
back
to
his
office
and
run
his
own
analysis
of
the
facts
that
were
before
him
in
the
record,
that
would
really
be
no
different
than
what
happened
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
are
you
going
to
tell
us
about
why
this
shouldn't
be
held
harmless
error?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
the
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
case
or
cases
in
this
court
squarely
hold
that
this
kind
of
discrimination
can
never
be
harmless
error?
do
you
think
rose
against
mitchell
stands
for
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
isn't
the
burden
of
proof,
the
burden
of
going
forward.
didn't
he
have
the
burden
of
sustaining
a
prima
facie
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
the
defendant
had
the
burden
of
carrying...
of
proving,
didn't
he?
