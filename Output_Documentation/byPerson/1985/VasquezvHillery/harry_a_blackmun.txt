mr.
prahl,
let
me
put
justice
powell's
question
another
way.
suppose
this
case
is
affirmed.
what
will
or
your
prosecutor
do?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
your
opposition,
i
think,
repeatedly
says
that
the
transcript
of
the
original
trial
is
available
to
you
for
use
in
a
retrial,
is
that
correct?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
would
you
proceed
to
try
to
prosecute
again?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
how
really
does
that
bear
on
harmless
error?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
seems
to
me
your
are
sweeping
everything
under
the
rug
of
harmless
error.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
is
hardly
harmless
error.
it
might
be
something
else.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
with
the
passage
of
time,
at
what
point
does
error
become
harmless?
