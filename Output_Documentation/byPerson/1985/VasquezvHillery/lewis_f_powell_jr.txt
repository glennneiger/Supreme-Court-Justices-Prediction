justice
lewis
f.
powell,

mr.
attorney
general,
before
you
move
away
from
the
question
of
delay,
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
whether
or
not
california
can
retry
the
respondent
at
this
time
23
years
afterwards?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
am
not
talking
about
harmless
error
at
this
point.
i
am
talking
about
whether
justification
is
given
for
the
automatic
reversal
rule.
cases
previously
before
this
court
have
been
that
the
defendant
may
be
retried.
within
a
certain
period.
so,
the
question
i
ask
you
is
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
whether
or
not
the
state
of
california,
after
quarter
of
a
century,
can
retry
this
particular
respondent?
the
witnesses
are
all
dead,
the
trial
judge
is
dead.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
tedmon?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
along
the
line
of
questions
justice
white
has
been
asking
you,
what
is
the
reasonable
rationale
for
the
per
se
rule
you
argue
for?
in
other
words,
why
should
there
never
be
harmless
error
in
this
type
of
case
which
is
your
second
argument?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes,
but
you
are
not
suggesting
that
constitutional
rights
can
never
be
found
to
be
harmless
error,
are
you?
what
you
said
in
your
brief
was
or
the
reason
for
your
present
position
is
that
the
integrity
of
the
judicial
process
requires
a
per
se
rule.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
think
this
is
the
only
constitutional
question
with
respect
to
the
integrity
of
the
judicial
process?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
your
position
is
there
can
never
be
harmless
error
rule
because
otherwise
the
integrity
of
the
judicial
process
would
be
put
at
issue.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
my
question
was
is
the
grand
jury
discrimination
the
only
situation
where
you
would
make
that
same
argument?
what
about--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--you
would
make
it
any
constitutional
error?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so,
the
integrity
of
the
judicial
process
is
at
stake?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
have
you
read
chapman?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
long
after
cassel.
what
did
it
hold?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
even
constitutional
error
and
the
error
in
that
case
was
a
comment
by
a
trial
judge
on
the
failure
of
the
defendant
to
take
the
stand.
do
you
think
that
is
less
of
a
constitutional
error
than...
that
went
to
the
integrity
of
the
trial
itself,
not
to
the
grand
jury.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
disagree
with
chapman?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
when
any
constitutional
right
has
been
violated,
it
ought
to
be
a
per
se
rule.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
courts
don't
agree
with
you.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but,
the
fairness
of
the
trial
in
this
case
was
not
affected
in
any
way
by--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--are
you
familiar
with
our
fairly
recent
decision
in
strickland
that
involved
whether
or
not
counsel
had
been
ineffective?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and,
there,
as
i
recall,
the
court
expressly
said
that
even
if
counsel
had
been
extremely
ineffective
in
substance
of
denial
with
the
right
to
counsel,
that
still
the
defendant
would
have
to
show
prejudice.
in
other
words,
we
declined
to
adopt
the
per
se
rule
there.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
can
you
think
of
any
more
important
constitutional
right
than
the
right
to
counsel?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
would
think
not.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so,
the
rationale
that
you
rely
on
is
the
integrity
of
the
judicial
process
has
never
been
uniformly
applied
by
this
court.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
your
rationale,
integrity
of
the
judicial
process,
has
never
been
uniformly
adopted
as
a
reason
for
not
applying
the
harmless
rule
by
this
court.
it
wasn't
any
case
that
i
suggested
to
you
and
there
are
several
others,
but
i
won't
take
your
time.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
will
ask
you
one
other
question
while
you
are
thinking.
who
is
concerned
with
the
integrity
of
the
judicial
process?
lawyers,
of
course,
are,
and
judges,
of
course,
are.
do
you
the
think
the
public
is?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
do
you
think
the
public
will
think
of
the
courts
in
this
case
after
23
years,
in
view
of
the
fact
this
man
has
been
unquestionably
found
guilty
of
a
brutal
murder,
and
you
are
here
arguing
today
that
because
of
integrity
of
the
judicial
process
we
should
let
him
off?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
is
your
argument.
but,
you
would
take
him
back
to
trial,
which,
of
course,
is
impossible
23
years
later.
you
are
a
trial
lawyer
and
i
was
in
court
some
myself
and
even
if
you
read
the
transcript
that
is
no
way
to
try
the
case,
like
some
of
the
writs
have
said
if
he
did.
anyway,
the
public,
i
think,
would
not
be
very
interested
in
your
rationale.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
public,
of
course,
is
interested
in
discrimination
against
blacks
or
anybody
else
in
the
composition
of
the
grand
jury.
but,
after
you
have
a
petit
jury
in
a
fair
trial
find
that
an
individual
is
convicted,
and
you
are
not
questioning
that.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
why
should
the
harmless
error
not
apply?
