mr.
prahl,
if
it
were
sent
back
as
unexhausted
to
the
state
court,
would
the
state
court
entertain
a
rehearing
on
that,
do
you
know?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
and
in
california
law
would
that
be
open?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
be
here
if
there
had
been,
maybe
not
in
this
grand
jury,
but
in
a
previous
one?
would
that
have
solved
the
problem
as
far
as
your
client
is
concerned
if
at
some
time
in
the
history
of
the
court
there
had
been
a
black
member
of
the
grand
jury?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
we
know
why
the
evidence
from
the
additional
witnesses
and
a
probability
analysis
was
not
presented
to
the
state
courts
by
mr.
hillery?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
the
burden
there
was
on
the
defendant
to
produce
his
evidence,
is
that
right
or
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
is
your
understanding
of
state
law
in
california
in
a
case
of
alleged
discrimination
in
grand
juror
selection,
that
the
burden
is
on
the
state
to
disprove
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
california,
is
there
no
burden
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
like
mr.
hillery
to
support
the
allegation
of--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
presumably
he
did
have
the
burden
of
proof
in
california?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and,
if
a
defendant
then
does
not
present
evidence
at
the
state
court
level
that
is
crucial
and
substantial,
can
the
defendant
then
simply
wait
until
going
to
federal
court
later
and
present
that
evidence
in
your
view?
is
there
never
a
proper
application
of
inexcusable
neglect,
for
instance,
that
would
preclude
the
defendant
from
later
presenting
that
for
a
second
crack
at
it
at
the
federal
habeas
level?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
tedmon,
i
thought
there
was
also
some
rather
significant
additional
witness
testimony
over
and
above
the
probability
analysis.
isn't
that
so?
