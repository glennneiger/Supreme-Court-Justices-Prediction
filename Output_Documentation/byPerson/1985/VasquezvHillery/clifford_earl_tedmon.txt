mr.
clifford
earl
tedmon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
hillery
filed
his
first
petition
in
federal
court
in
1978,
filed
in
the
northern
district
of
california,
the
wrong
forum.
it
was
a
per
se
petition
and
it
was
transferred
to
the
eastern
district
of
california
where
chief
judge
thomas
j.
macbride
was
assigned
the
case.
judge
macbride,
in
reviewing
hillery's
petition,
decided
that
hillery
had
set
forth
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination
in
the
selection
of
the
grand
jury
which
had
handed
down
the
indictment
against
him
in
1962.
he
formed
that
opinion
fundamentally
based
on
hillery's
allegations
that
in
the
history
of
kings
county,
california,
which
was
formed
in
1893,
until
1962,
there
had
never
been
a
black
person
on
a
grand
jury
in
that
county.
mr.
clifford
earl
tedmon
i
think
if
there
had
been
some
evidence
that
in
the
history
of
the
county
there
had
been
a
black
or
blacks
on
the
grand
jury,
i
think
hillery
would
not
have
a
position
here
today.
i
think
that
would
be
part
of
his
problem.
there
are
many
ways
you
can
look
at
the
problem,
because
if
you
got
down
to
the
individual
grand
jury
that
indicted
him
and
he
could
show
some
clear
discrimination
there,
he
might
have
an
argument.
but,
the
argument
basically,
as
judge
macbride
saw
it,
was
that
in
the
history
of
the
county
there
had
never
been
a
black
on
a
grand
jury
and
that,
in
his
mind,
lead
him
to
say...
as
far
as
he
was
concerned,
that
was
evidence
which
established
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination.
now,
when
he
took
senior
status,
the
case
was
assigned
to
judge
karlton
who
had
just
been
appointed
chief
judge
of
the
district.
when
judge
karlton
took
the
case
he
had
a
problem,
because
he
had
the
california
supreme
court's
decision
that
hillery
had
not
established
a
case
of
discrimination
in
the
grand
jury
that
indicted
him.
he
had
chief
judge
macbride's
opinion
that
a
prima
facie
case
had
been
established.
now,
judge
karlton
was
compelled
to
apply
the
presumption
of
correctness
doctrine
to
the
california
factfinding,
although
he
didn't
have
to
do
it
to
the
legal
conclusion,
but
at
the
same
token,
he
had
judge
macbride's
law
of
the
case
before
him.
he
had
to
decide
what
to
do
with
these
two
conflicting
opinions.
mr.
clifford
earl
tedmon
the
first
decision
in
the
california
supreme
court
was
handed
down
in
1963,
your
honor.
the
second
decision
was
handed
down
in
1965.
those
are
the
only
two
decisions
discussed
in
the
problems
we
are
discussing
here
today.
what
judge
karlton
did
was
examine
judge
macbride's
order,
because
the
state
had
already
responded.
the
state
had
indicated
hillery
had
exhausted
his
state
remedy.
they
argued
that
the
rich
had
not
lied
because
a
full
and
fair
hearing
had
been
held
in
the
state
court.
but,
judge
karlton
believed
that
perhaps
judge
macbride's
opinion
was
a
little
premature
for
the
reason
that
the
mere
exclusion
of
blacks
from
a
grand
jury
did
not
necessarily
mean
discrimination.
he
believed
there
should
be
some
other
data
in
support
of
that
which
would
tell
him
whether
or
not
there
had
been
some
discrimination
in
the
grand
jury
process
in
kings
county,
california.
furthermore,
the
state
record
had
not
been
lodged
with
the
district
court
until
after
the
court
had
issued
its
order.
so,
in
that
regard,
he
determined
to
set
aside
that
portion
of
the
order
which
said
it
was
a
prima
facie
case.
he
was
concerned
that
perhaps
hillery
had
not
had
a
full
and
fair
hearing
in
state
court,
because
when
he
examined
the
supreme
court's
decision,
it
basically
relied
on
what
judge
wingrove
had
said
in
terms
of
the
fact
that
he
did
not
discriminate.
it
really
did
not
discuss
very
much
of
the
evidence
that
was
presented
other
than
to
relate
it
to
a
prior
case
the
california
supreme
court
had
decided,
people
versus
burwell,
in
1955
and
in
that
case
they
held
the
judge's
testimony
would
be
indicative
of
the
fact
that
there
was
no
discrimination
and
they
related
the
hillery
case
to
the
burwell
case.
judge
karlton
wasn't
convinced
that
that
was
a
completely
correct
analysis.
so,
what
he
determined
to
do
was
utilize
the
tools
available
to
him.
those
tools
came
under
the
rules
that
applied
at
2254
proceedings.
he
determined
to
expand
the
record.
and,
in
that
determination,
what
he
did
is
ask
both
sides
to
answer
some
interrogatories.
he
indicated
in
his
order
that
he
would
like
to
see
some
probability
analysis
to
indicate
to
him
whether
or
not
this
lack
of
blacks
on
a
grand
jury
could
have
resulted
by
chance
as
opposed
to
discriminatory
acts.
hillery
responded
by
providing
information
to
the
court.
there
were
twelve
interrogatories
propounded
and
four
of
them
really
related
to
whether
or
not
there
were
eligible
blacks
in
the
community,
what
were
the
total
percentage
of
blacks
throughout
the
various
years,
and
it
was
that
question
that
lead
hillery
to
present
to
the
court
census
data
from
1900
through
1970
with
a
cut-off
data
at
1962.
the
california
court
had
only
had
census
data
from
1910
to
1960.
but,
in
answering
the
judge's
questions
as
well
as
hillery
could,
he
felt
compelled
to
provide
all
of
the
data
available
to
him
at
that
time
and
the
earliest
census
date
was
1900.
he
provided
for
the
court
what
has
been
referred
to
as
a
sophisticated
computerized
analysis
which
we
don't
really
believe
is
a
proper
characterization.
it
was
a
probability
analysis.
it
is
pretty
much
an
arithmetic
calculation
which
has
been
done
for
many,
many
years.
the
reason
the
computer
was
used
is
because
it
is
faster
and
it
gets
you
a
little
bit
more
complete
answers.
you
would
get
it,
i
suppose,
if
you
did
logarithms
or
some
other
manner,
but
the
computer
was
just
a
device,
a
technique,
for
analyzing
the
data
and
that
is
exactly
how
judge
karlton
saw
the
problem.
he
didn't
see
this
as
any
fancy,
new
mathematical
program.
mr.
clifford
earl
tedmon
your
honor,
in
the
record
of
the
hearing
at
the
motion
to
quash...
it
is
a
difficult
record.
there
was
a
lot
of
what
appeared
to
me
frankly
to
be
hostile
dialogue
between
judge
wingrove
and
hugh
goodwin.
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mr.
cantleman,
who
was
the
district
attorney
handling
that
hearing,
during
the
course
of
that
hearing
suggested
to
judge
wingrove,
what
has
to
happen
here
is
we
have
to
do
an
analysis
to
find
out
if,
first
of
all,
blacks
constitute
a
significant
portion
of
the
population.
second,
within
that
portion
of
the
population,
are
there
blacks
eligible
to
be
on
the
grand
jury
and
none
of
that
was
ever
followed
up
on
at
the
district
court
level.
that
is
one
of
the
holes
in
the
record
that
judge
karlton--
mr.
clifford
earl
tedmon
--well,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
according
to...
as
i
recall
the
record,
according
to
the
record,
the
responsibility
rested
with
the
state
to
produce
the
statistical
data.
they
would
not
do
it.
mr.
clifford
earl
tedmon
i
think
what
happens
is
the
court
directs
the
state
to
present
the
evidence
and
in
that
particular
case
the
state
did
present
evidence.
they
presented
the
census
data
from
1910
through
1960.
they
presented
evidence
from
alice
hanna,
who
was
the
county
librarian,
on
the
black--
mr.
clifford
earl
tedmon
--i
don't
know
of
any
law
that
imposes
a
burden
on
him.
i
just
don't
know
of
any.
mr.
clifford
earl
tedmon
yes,
he
would
have
to
make
that
allegation.
mr.
clifford
earl
tedmon
yes.
then
he
would
have
the
burden
of
moving
forward,
i
believe.
mr.
clifford
earl
tedmon
i
believe
he
would
have
the
burden
of
moving
forward,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
clifford
earl
tedmon
i
don't
know
of
any
rule
of
inexcusable
neglect,
your
honor.
mr.
clifford
earl
tedmon
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
clifford
earl
tedmon
yes,
that
is
the
way
the
courts
rule.
in
this
particular
case,
the
claim
remains
the
same.
i
don't
think
anybody
argues
that
point.
the
claim
remains
the
same.
the
only
thing
that
happened
in
the
district
court
which
was
different
from
the
superior
court
was
that
there
was
an
analysis
done
of
the
data
that
was
really
before
both
of
the
courts.
now,
that
analysis
was
not
done
by
the
court
in
kings
county,
it
wasn't
done
by
the
prosecutor
in
kings
county,
it
wasn't
done
by
mr.
goodwin
in
kings
county.
it
just
appeared
to
judge
karlton
that
what
he
should
do
is
apply
some
sort
of
analytical
tool
to
the
data
to
give
him
a
little
more
information
in
terms
of
analyzing
the
data.
mr.
clifford
earl
tedmon
yes.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
judge
karlton
did
something
similar
to
that.
he
sat
down...
and
the
record
reflects
that
he
did
a
card
analysis
with
an
eight
of
diamonds
missing
from
the
deck
and
he
also
sat
down...
and
palming
the
card...
and
he
also
sat
down
on
his
own
and
did
a
standard
deviation
analysis
and
came
up
with
what
would
have
been
a
weak
case
for
mr.
hillery,
a
standard
deviation
of
3.03.
however,
relating
to
the
total
lack
of
blacks
on
the
grand
jury
and
the
computerized
analysis,
he
determined
that
those
things
fit
together.
mr.
clifford
earl
tedmon
yes.
there
were
three
witnesses
who
testified
at
the
hearing,
evvie
edwards,
joshua
richardson,
and
reverend
folsom.
they
were
elderly
black
people
and
they
had
been
in
the
county
long
before
1956
and
they
were
still
in
the
county
when
the
hearing
was
held.
they
merely
testified
to
the
following:
that,
yes,
there
were
blacks
in
the
community.
they
testified
that
the
major
influx
came
after
world
war
ii,
that
there
was
a
small
percentage
of
blacks
in
the
community
until
after
the
war
and
then
it
gradually
increased.
they
testified
that
there
were
blacks
eligible,
as
they
understood
it,
to
be
on
the
grand
jury.
they
had
college
graduates,
people
who
had
gone
to
colleges
around
the
country
and
were
now
into
the
community.
they
testified
that
if
they
had
been
asked,
they
would
have
served.
but,
other
than
that,
i
don't
think
they
contributed
anything
else.
now,
that
testimony
was
essentially
all
before
the
superior
court,
because
the
sheriff
of
kings
county
testifying
in
superior
court
here,
and
the
newspaper
man
both
testified
that
they
had
never
known
a
black
to
on
a
grand
jury
in
the
history
of
kings
county,
which
is
what
the
elderly
black
people
testified
to.
they
testified
that
there
were
blacks
in
the
community.
now,
with
respect
to
whether
there
were
eligible
blacks
or
not,
none
of
the
witnesses
testified
to
that
in
the
superior
court
hearing.
but,
judge
wingrove
discussed
it.
he
indicated,
yes,
i
had
considered
lloyd
welcher.
that
is
bessie
welcher's
husband
and
bessie
gave
a
deposition
in
this
case.
yes,
i
did
talk
to
lloyd
welcher
and
i
considered
him,
but
then
i
decided
it
would
interfere
with
his
employment,
so
i
chose
not
to
place
him
on
the
grand
jury,
which
must
indicate
that
the
court
in
kings
county
was
aware
that
there
were
eligible
blacks,
and
if
there
is
one
eligible
black,
reason
and
common
sense
would
suggest
there
is
more
than
one.
so,
i
don't
think
the
testimony
of
the
elderly
black
people
really
altered
anything
that
was
before
the
california
superior
court.
in
any
event,
judge
karlton,
in
analyzing
all
of
the
data
that
was
presented,
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
hillery
had
established
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination
and
that
that
prima
facie
case
was
unrefuted
by
the
state.
now,
during
the
hearing
itself
the
testimony
from
the
actuary
was
taken
and
he
explained
his
analysis
and
an
interesting
part
of
the
problem
that
comes
out
of
that
hearing
is
that
judge
karlton
asked
the
computer
expert
would
you
please
do
a
probability
calculation
only
for
the
years
1956
to
1962,
the
years
during
which
judge
wingrove
was
the
only
sitting
judge
in
kings
county,
california.
he
selected
the
people
who
would
be
candidates
for
the
grand
jury.
after
the
review,
he
hand-picked
the
grand
jurors
themselves.
so,
he
was
kings
county,
california,
as
far
as
the
grand
jury
was
concerned.
he
was
the
policy-making
agent.
what
he
did
with
his
pocket
calculator
was
sat
down
and
said,
yes,
i
can
do
this
calculation.
he
worked
it
out
and
in
that
calculation
he
said
there
would
only
be
a
probability
of
two
chances
out
of
a
thousand
in
that
seven-year
period
you
could
have
had
all
non-black
grand
juries.
now,
in
judge
karlton's
opinion,
he
restricted
his
thinking
to
those
seven
years
and
i
think
that
is
very
critical
to
the
analysis
of
whether
he
really
went
that
far
out
of
the
state
court
record.
at
any
hearing,
you
are
going
to
hear
evidence,
you
are
going
to
hear
testimony.
you
can't
stop
a
trial
judge
from
taking
evidence.
i
don't
know
how
you
would
do
that.
as
i
view
the
state's
position,
what
they
are
saying
is
that
judge
karlton
would
not
sit
there
and
listen
to
the
testimony.
what
he
would
do
was
sit
there
and
say,
am
i
going
to
hear
a
word
which
is
going
to
take
this
outside
of
what
the
state
court
had.
i
don't
think
you
can
do
that
through
a
trial
judge.
he
is
bound
to
hear
something
that
wasn't
presented
to
the
state
court.
but,
the
question
is
what
does
he
do
with
once
he
hears
it?
what
he
did
was
restrict
his
thinking
to
that
seven-year
period
and
i
think
that
is
very
appropriate
and
very
compelling
in
terms
of
how
he
handled
the
case.
he
further,
in
analyzing
the
rules
that
apply
to
2254
motion,
made
some
conclusions
which
are
all
in
the
record
to
the
effect
that
if
summary
dismissal
was
not...
if
he
couldn't
do
that
at
the
outset,
then
the
hearing
would
be
mandated,
but
there
was
this
intermediate
stage
when
he
could
expand
the
record,
which
is
what
he
did.
he
then
after
that
determined
that
even
if
something
began
to
come
out
during
the
hearing
which
would
significantly
alter
the
posture
of
the
case,
he
should
still
have
the
right
to
continue
on,
complete
the
hearing
in
judicial
economy
terms,
finalize
the
case,
finish
the
thing
out.
so,
what
he
did
in
any
event
was
make
his
decision
that
a
prima
facie
case
had
been
established
and
it
was
rebutted
in
the
record.
he
issued
his
order
that
the
writ
should
issue.
this
went
up
on
appeal
in
the
ninth
circuit,
upheld
judge
karlton,
with
the
exception
of
justice
j.
blaine
anderson,
who
dissented
on
the
basis
of...
there
were
new
facts
and
new
methods.
and,
justice
anderson's
opinion
is
a
very
interesting
one,
very
short.
he
really
just
talks
about
anything
that
wasn't
presented
to
the
state
court.
he
says
this
was
a
new
method.
he
said
the
census
data
from
1900
to
1910
were
new
facts.
the
testimony
of
the
elderly
black
people
was
not
before
the
superior
court
of
california.
but,
he
never
addressed
himself
to
what
judge
karlton
did
in
his
opinion
and
i
think
that
is
where
we
would
not
totally
agree
with
judge
anderson's
assessment
of
this.
it
may
be
some
slight
different
piece
of
evidence
or
something,
but
the
question
as
to
what
did
it
do
in
a
judge's
decision
and
he
has
the
duty
to
make
that
decision.
we
feel
that
judge
karlton
made
the
proper
decision.
now,
the
state
is
asking
that
this
now
established
case
of
discrimination
in
the
selection
of
the
grand
jury,
this
systematic
exclusion
of
blacks
from
that
grand
jury
process,
which
is
now
the
case,
that
we
should
determine
there
was
what
he
calls
overwhelming
evidence
at
the
trial
and
that
is
so
compelling
and
there
is
no
complaint
about
the
trial,
that
we
should
now
determine
the
fact
that
this
man's
constitutional
rights
at
the
grand
jury
level
were
abused
should
be
held
to
be
harmless.
obviously,
hillery
can
never
agree
with
that.
frankly,
we
tend
to
see
these
two
events
as
somewhat
unique
and
separated.
while
it
is
true
that
the
charging
document
ties
them
together,
what
applies
in
one
phase
may
not
apply
in
the
other
phase.
hillery
is
not
challenging
his
jury
conviction.
he
can't
do
that
any
more.
he
is
not
challenging
the
make-up
of
the
petit
jury
that
tried
him.
mr.
clifford
earl
tedmon
he
made
it
before
he
was
ever
brought
to
trial.
he
made
it
in
1962
in
a
motion
to
quash
the
indictment
of
his
pre-trial
hearing
on
the
motion,
your
honor.
and,
he
raised
the
issue
on
appeal
to
the
california
courts
in
1963.
they
heard
it
in
1963.
and,
i
might
add
that
there
was
really
only
one
guilt
phase
trial
in
this
case.
there
were
several
penalty
phase
trials,
but
only
one...
it
has
been
suggested
there
were
two,
but
there
really
was
only
one.
he
raised
in
'63.
he
raised
it
again
in
'65.
the
supreme
court
decision
in
'65,
as
well
as
i
can
analyze
it,
is
a
word-for-word
copy
of
the
supreme
court
decision
in
1963.
it
does
not
appear
to
me
that
they
really
re-evaluated.
they
probably
merely
accepted
the
trial
court's
determination
once
again.
that
never
came
up
again
until
hillery
brought
his
writ
or
habeas
corpus
motion
in
marin
county,
california,
and
that
occurred
in
1978.
but,
between
that
period
of
time...
and
a
long
period
of
time
has
passed,
about
16
years...
he
is
now
fighting
the
penalty
phase
trial.
judge
karlton
commented
on
that
in
one
of
his
opinions
and
he
said
probably
if
hillery
had
brought
his
writ
over
to
the
federal
court
while
the
contests
were
going
on,
the
federal
court
would
have
issued
a
summary
dismissal
anyway
on
the
theory
that
we
don't
know
whether
you
are
going
to
have
other
ones
or
not,
you
had
better
go
back,
do
it
all
at
one
time.
it
is
sort
of
that
approach
which
the
district
courts
like
to
do,
i
think,
in
most
cases.
he
brought
it
before
the
marin
county
court.
it
went
through
the
california
courts
in
1978,
denied,
denied,
denied.
i
think
the
last
denial
was
by
the
california
supreme
court
in
april
of
'78.
mr.
clifford
earl
tedmon
oh,
i
am
sorry.
i
feel--
mr.
clifford
earl
tedmon
--that
is
the
issue.
your
honor,
an
error
of
this
magnitude,
wherein
an
entire
grand
jury
proceeding
is
tainted
in
respondent's
view
can
never
be
held
to
be
harmless.
this
court
has
had
a
number
of
holdings
which
have
discussed
grand
jury
foremen.
for
example,
in
rose
versus
mitchell
and
in
the
hobby
case
they
discuss
a
grand
jury
foreman
in
a
different
context.
but,
when
they
find--
mr.
clifford
earl
tedmon
--i
don't
think
it
says
that.
i
think
it
suggests
it
very
strongly,
because
rose
versus
mitchell
talks
about
the
impact
of
the
discriminatory
act
on
the
grand
jury.
in
this
case,
we
have
an
entire
grand
jury
selected
in
a
discriminatory
manner.
i
don't
see
how,
if
the
rose
versus
mitchell...
had
they
been
able
to
establish
their
prima
facie
case,
i
believe
this
court
would
have
overturned
that
conviction.
that
is
my
view
of
it.
that
wasn't
done
in
rose
versus
mitchell,
so
the
case
was
not
overturned.
but,
the
holding
of
the
case
certainly
seems
to
suggest
it
would
have
been
overturned.
mr.
clifford
earl
tedmon
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
clifford
earl
tedmon
yes.
because
in
our
view
it
is
a
violation
of
a
fundamental
constitutional
right,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
clifford
earl
tedmon
--that
is
correct.
mr.
clifford
earl
tedmon
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
the
question,
justice--
mr.
clifford
earl
tedmon
--yes,
in
this
type
of
a
case,
in
a
grand
jury
discrimination
case.
mr.
clifford
earl
tedmon
i
don't
think
so.
i
have
been--
mr.
clifford
earl
tedmon
--when
the
constitution
gets
violated,
it
is
very...
to
me--
mr.
clifford
earl
tedmon
--the
integrity
of
the
whole
constitution
is
at
stake.
mr.
clifford
earl
tedmon
chapman
versus?
mr.
clifford
earl
tedmon
oh,
yes,
i
have,
your
honor.
mr.
clifford
earl
tedmon
well,
it
held
that
in
certain
situations
there
could
be
harmless
error.
mr.
clifford
earl
tedmon
even
a
constitutional
error.
mr.
clifford
earl
tedmon
exactly,
your
honor,
and
i
understand.
mr.
clifford
earl
tedmon
i
tend
to
disagree
on
a
constitutional
right
has
been
violated.
mr.
clifford
earl
tedmon
yes,
i
think
so,
but
the
courts
don't
hold
that
way
necessarily.
mr.
clifford
earl
tedmon
the
problem
comes
out
this
way,
as
i
view
it,
your
honor.
there
are
trial
phase
problems
which
seemly
can
be
corrected
at
the
trial
stage.
this
violation
in
hillery
can
only
be
corrected
by
overturning
the
conviction.
there
is
no
other
remedy
available
to
him.
for
example,
as
the
court
has
done
in
some
of
the
fourth
amendment
cases...
the
courts
have
taken
the
position
that
you
shouldn't
keep
the
evidence
out
because
the
right
has
been
violated.
they
are
talking
about
evidence
at
a
trial.
they
are
really
not
saying
that
you
shouldn't
have
a
remedy
for
the
violation
of
the--
mr.
clifford
earl
tedmon
--no.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
indicates
what
happened
to
hillery
at
the
indictment
phase
had
anything
to
do
with
his
conviction.
mr.
clifford
earl
tedmon
yes.
that
is
strickland
versus
washington.
mr.
clifford
earl
tedmon
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
clifford
earl
tedmon
that
is
correct.
mr.
clifford
earl
tedmon
i
would
think
not.
mr.
clifford
earl
tedmon
i
would
think
that
is
a
very
fundamental
right,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
clifford
earl
tedmon
i
missed
that
again.
mr.
clifford
earl
tedmon
i
think--
mr.
clifford
earl
tedmon
--i
think
so.
mr.
clifford
earl
tedmon
i
don't
know
that
he
would
be
let
off.
mr.
clifford
earl
tedmon
i
think
they
would,
your
honor.
i
apologize,
i
am
not
disagreeing,
but
i
think
the
public
is
interested.
mr.
clifford
earl
tedmon
no.
mr.
clifford
earl
tedmon
because
you
would
have
a
right
for
which
there
would
be
no
remedy
if
the
harmless
error
rule
applied.
it
would
not
be,
as
i
view
it...
there
wouldn't
be
much
of
a
constitutional
right
if
no
remedy
could
attach
for
the
violation
of
that
right.
mr.
clifford
earl
tedmon
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
mr.
goodwin
said
that
if
he
had
been
put
through
a
preliminary
hearing
he
would
have
been
bound
over.
i
don't
think
there
is
anything
in
the
record
where
mr.
goodwin
talked
about
another
grand
jury
proceeding.
