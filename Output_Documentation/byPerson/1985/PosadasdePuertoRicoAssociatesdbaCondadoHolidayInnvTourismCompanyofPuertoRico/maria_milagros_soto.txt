ms.
maria
milagros
soto
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
a
substantial
question
whether
a
statute
of
puerto
rico
violates
the
first,
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments
of
the
united
states
constitution
because
it
completely
bans
a
franchise
holder,
a
casino
franchise
holder,
from
advertising
or
otherwise
offering
its
casino
facilities
to
the
public
of
puerto
rico.
without
abandoning
our
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendment
attacks
on
section
8
of
the
games
of
chance
act
of
puerto
rico,
we
have
chosen
to
limit
our
argument
to
the
first
amendment
protection
extended
to
truthful
information
about
legal
activities,
and
rely
on
our
briefs
for
the
remaining
valid
grounds,
although
in
our
minds,
after
living
through
the
over-extensive
obligation
that
puerto
rico
has
given
to
the
statute,
we
cannot
characterize
this
ban
as
strictly
commercial
speech.
the
over-breadth
and
vagueness
of
the
ban
abridges,
has
abridged
in
the
past,
as
the
record
shows,
fully
protected
speech
and
public
debate
speech.
neither
can
we
accept
as
valid
the
classification,
subclassification,
of
a
casino
speech
ban
versus
the
public
forum
availability
open
to
other
gaining
activities
in
puerto
rico,
nor
the
resident
versus
nonresident
classification
that
the
judgment
below
added
to
the
original
controversy.
however,
argument
on
the
first
amendment
content
based
classification
of
the
act
should
persuade
the
court
to
hold
that
casino
advertising
is
protected
by
the
united
states
constitution,
and
that
all
truthful
information
about
this
legal
activity
cannot
be
blocked
by
puerto
rico
in
an
effort
to
keep
its
people
uninformed
as
an
extensive
means
of
controlling
through
speech
the
activity
of
gambling.
the
best
example
of
the
dangers
inherent
in
over-broad
prohibitions
of
speech,
containing
no
guidelines
of
enforcement
for
the
government,
are
given
by
the
facts
of
this
case.
section
8
of
the
statute
reads:
"no
gambling
room
shall
be
permitted
to
advertise
or
otherwise
offer
its
facilities
in
any
manner
whatsoever
to
the
public
in
puerto
rico.
"
in
30
years
of
enforcement,
the
government
never
defined
what
constituted
advertising,
nor
who
was
the
public.
neither
did
it
clarify
whether
in
puerto
rico,
including
the
tourist
ones,
he
or
she
landed
in
puerto
rico.
ms.
maria
milagros
soto
yes,
it
did,
your
honor,
but
it
did
not
cure
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
statute
as
we
would
argue.
ms.
maria
milagros
soto
the
statute
as
construed
still
prohibits
completely
all
information
if
it's
addressed
to
the
residents
of
puerto
rico.
and
therefore,
it
is
still
a
complete
ban
of
truthful
information
about
a
legal
business
to
the
residents
of
puerto
rico,
and
thus
unconstitutional,
in
our
view,
as
construed.
ms.
maria
milagros
soto
well,
your
honor--
ms.
maria
milagros
soto
--according
to
what
the
judge
decided,
if
it
was
aimed
at
the
tourists
it
would
not
be
prohibited.
the
problem
is
that
the
determination
as
to
what
the
intent
is
would
have
to
be
based
on
content.
each
time
that
an
advertisement
or
information
about
a
casino
is...
comes
across,
and
for
instance,
we
brought
to
this
court's
attention
a
case
whereby
even
under
the
court's
construction
now,
as
recently
as
after
this
court
had
granted
jurisdiction
to
hear
this
case,
a
supplement
was
published
with
information
about
the
casino
activities
upon
the
opening
of
the
second
hotel,
the
el
san
juan
hotel,
that
merely
covered
the
facilities
that
were
open
to
the
public.
one
page
out
of
52
that
cover
all
the
other
facilities
of
the
hotel
was
conceded
by
the
government
as
casino
advertising,
and
something
that
they
had
not
done
before.
they
did
not
fine
us
this
time,
but
they
said
that
the
case
was
being
turned
over
for
investigation
for
criminal
prosecution.
now,
this
statute
is
a
criminal
statute
and
this
was
a
supplement
by...
an
article
by
the
newspaper
was
not
an
ad
placed,
as
the
judge
directed,
and
still
it's
being
considered
as
advertising
to
puerto
rico.
so
an
example
that
we
still
have
the
same
problem.
ms.
maria
milagros
soto
that's
what
it
does.
we
understand
that--
ms.
maria
milagros
soto
--as
the
court
rewrote
it,
which
we
understand
is
what
the
court
did,
and
it
is
impermissible
in
our
view.
it
would
establish
a
classification
then
that
i
think
is
also
impermissible,
of
residents
versus
nonresidents,
yes.
ms.
maria
milagros
soto
if
it's
an
absolute
ban
and
it
leaves
no
channels
open
of
communications
to
the
residents
of
puerto
rico
in
this
case,
and
the
activity
is
legal,
we
understand
that
unless
there
is
a
substantial
interest
by
the
government,
which
has
not
been
proven
in
this
case,
it
is
unconstitutional,
yes.
ms.
maria
milagros
soto
we
have
no
quarrel
whatsoever,
justice
white,
on
having
more
speech
on
it
if
we
have
to,
rather
than
silencing
and
keeping
the
people
uninformed
altogether
as
a
means.
ms.
maria
milagros
soto
in
the
case
of
cigarettes,
i
find
a
substantial
distinction
in
that
cigarettes--
ms.
maria
milagros
soto
--it
is
not
illegal
to
smoke.
ms.
maria
milagros
soto
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
however--
ms.
maria
milagros
soto
--i
haven't
said
that
it's
good.
i
think
it
probably
would
pass
constitutional
muster
if--
ms.
maria
milagros
soto
--well,
first
of
all
it
is
harmful
to
your
health
according
to
studies.
in
the
case
of
gaming,
gaming
is
a
social
entertainment
and
there
is
no
link
whatsoever
that
it
causes
a
deleterious
effect
in
older
people.
it
may
cause,
if
some
people
gamble
excessively--
ms.
maria
milagros
soto
--yes,
i
do,
your
honor,
justice
o'connor.
i
think
they
can
prohibit
it
together.
but
having
legalized
it,
and
having
other
means
available
already
in
the
act
that
are
affected,
i
don't
think
they
can--
ms.
maria
milagros
soto
--through
speech,
control
it.
ms.
maria
milagros
soto
i
think
once
having
legalized
it...
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
case
of
the
marijuana
statute
in
alaska,
but
once
having
legalized
it,
i
think
it
can
be
restricted
through
a
means
and
manners
restriction.
i
think
it
can
be
added
more
speech
as
to
what
effects...
so
as
to
keep
the
people
educated,
how
they
should
not
be
using
it.
but
i
don't
think
they
should
be
able
to
prohibit
it
altogether
either,
no.
ms.
maria
milagros
soto
as
long
as
smoking
is
legal.
or,
my
position
is,
since
it
is
inherently
dangerous
to
health,
it
might
be
possible
to
ban
it.
ms.
maria
milagros
soto
that
would
be
the
same
thing
with
marijuana
in
that
case,
then.
we
can
make
that
analogy.
but,
it's
not
the
same
thing
with
gambling.
and,
that
is
our
proposition.
gambling
has
not
been
proven
to
be
deleterious
per
se,
because
it's
not
inherently
dangerous.
it
is
simply
a
leisure
entertainment
activity
for
most
of
the
people.
it's
social,
fun,
thing
to
do,
and
to
some
people
it
may
be,
if
it's
excessive,
cause
some
harm
but
that
is
not
the
general
proposition
here.
and
if
we
extend
now...
i
mean,
so
many
other
things
could
be
harmful.
there
are
so
many
carcinogenic
things
now,
that
causes
cancer.
should
they
all
be
prohibited,
then?
i
think
that
in
the
absence
of
a
substantial
interest,
ban
on
speech
is
not
the
narrowest
means
to
obtain
that
end.
ms.
maria
milagros
soto
yes,
they
do.
ms.
maria
milagros
soto
yes.
ms.
maria
milagros
soto
the
statute
did
ban
all
kinds
of
media.
the
way
it
was
construed
by
the
court,
it
would
allow,
if
it's
published
in
the
states
and
it
comes
through
into
puerto
rico...
as
construed
by
the
judicial
branch.
ms.
maria
milagros
soto
yes,
under
the
construction
of
the
court,
yes.
ms.
maria
milagros
soto
correct,
under
the
construction.
now,
the
facts
of
this
case
are
clearly...
i'm
familiar
with
it,
but
to
go
briefly
through
them,
posadas
was
fined
for
the
first
time
when
a
supplement
was
published
in
the
san
juan
star,
an
article
about
annexing
the
laguna
wing
to
its
already
facilities,
and
there
was
an
ad
placed
by
our
union,
our
casino
union,
that
contained
no
message
about
promoting
the
casino,
but
that
included
the
word
"casino"
as
its
trade
name
and
a
little
drawing
about
a
roulette
in
the
background.
tourism
understood
that
was
casino
advertising,
and
it
warned...
tourism
warned
posadas
that
it
was
violating
the
law.
because
it
did
not
get
a
reply
from
posadas,
a
fine
was
imposed
on
the
company.
this
interpretation
was
immediately
challenged
by
posadas,
but
while
a
ruling
was
pending
the
gaming
director
wrote
a
letter
to
the
president,
then,
that
was
stationed
in
missouri,
informing
about
the
violations
in
the
operations
in
puerto
rico.
the
president
was
quick
to
answer,
but
used
stationery
that
had
the
word
"casino"
on
it,
and
since
the
government
understood
that
the
word
"casino"
on
letterhead
is
also
advertising,
a
second
fine
was
imposed
on
posadas.
the
third
fine
was
imposed
after
the
ruling
came
out
and
the
ruling
was
upholding
an
absolute
ban
on
speech,
and
because
one
of
the
guests
that
was
staying
in
the
hotel
had
a
brochure
that
was
left
in
his
room
and
was
handing
it
at
the
lobby,
which
was
a
public
facility,
to
the
government
inspector,
and
they
thought
that
was
casino
advertising
also,
and
there
was
a
third
fine
that
was
imposed
on
posadas.
and
the
fourth
fine
really
was
a
public
debate
issue
where
the
president
was
holding
a
press
conference
and
photographic
session
to
protest
legislation
that
proposed
to
ban
the
slot
machines
from
puerto
rico.
ms.
maria
milagros
soto
yes,
your
honor,
they
were
all
there.
ms.
maria
milagros
soto
yes.
as
a
result
of
these
four
fines,
posadas'
reputation
was
tainted
to
the
extreme
that
our
system
operation
in
atlantic
city
was
recommended
denial
of
a
casino
license
because
the
new
gaming
enforcement
division
of
our
jurisdiction
understood
that
posadas
was
an
unsuitable
operator.
at
that
point,
declaratory
judgment
was
sought,
at
that
initial
stage,
on
paragraph
9
of
the
complaint,
that
three
challenges
to
the
first,
fourteenth
amendment,
and
due
process
were
brought
up
at
that
initial
level.
in
the
case
of
the
due
process
we
did
not
specify
whether
it
was
the
fifth
or
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
as
we
understand
it,
this
court
has
now
decided
which
of
the
two
due
processes
are
applicable
to
puerto
rico,
as
declined
in
the
calero-toledo
case.
ms.
maria
milagros
soto
that
is
correct.
before
that--
ms.
maria
milagros
soto
--oh,
i'm
sorry.
i
misunderstood
you,
then.
no,
no.
the
fines
were
imposed
before.
i
thought
he
said--
ms.
maria
milagros
soto
--yes.
these
four
fines,
and
the
fact
that
we
were
almost
denied
a
hotel
license,
was
before
the
final--
ms.
maria
milagros
soto
--these
were
the
facts
that
brought
the
case
up.
we
continued
then...
we
have
to...
as
a
basic
proposition,
we
think
that
by
the
court
rewriting
the
statute
it
has
invaded
legislative
functions,
and
our
main
recommendation
is
that
this
statute--
ms.
maria
milagros
soto
--as
it
was
is
the
one
that
should
be
construed
by
this
court.
ms.
maria
milagros
soto
i
don't
think
that
has
been
decided,
justice
o'connor.
i
think
if
this
court
agrees
to
extend
to
puerto
rico
the
protections
as
if
it
were
a
state,
which
i
think
it's
undecided
up
to
this
point--
ms.
maria
milagros
soto
--i
think
you
would
in
matters
of
local
law.
however,
even--
ms.
maria
milagros
soto
--no.
ms.
maria
milagros
soto
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
the
state
deference
will
not
preclude
the
court...
this
court's
role
as
the
final
arbiter
of
the
federal
constitution,
when
it
means
the
invalidation
of
a
statute.
ms.
maria
milagros
soto
not
if
it
clashes
with
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
ms.
maria
milagros
soto
if
this
court
decides
to
defer,
yes.
i
just
bring
the
proposition
because
i
don't
think
that
has
been
decided
yet,
so
the
proposition
was
that
in
one
case
you
would
go
and
interpret
it
directly,
yourselves,
you
do
give
it
state...
status,
as
is,
it's
still
unconstitutional.
ms.
maria
milagros
soto
if
it's
addressed
to
the
residents
of
puerto
rico,
everything
that
has
to
do
with
a
casino
is
still
prohibited.
they
have
allowed
the
word
of
"casino"
in
a
trade
name
of--
ms.
maria
milagros
soto
--i
think
so,
because
that's
precisely
why
i
brought
the
example
of
a
recent
case
that
happened
just
this
december.
that
was
after
the
statute
was
construed,
whereby
under
this
interpretation
and
even
after
this
court
had
granted
jurisdiction,
or
construed
jurisdiction
at
least
until
the
merits...
they
are
still
construing
the
statute
that
if
it's
addressed
to
the
public
of
puerto
rico
it's
prohibited,
and
here
we
are
talking
about
a
supplement
that
was
in
english.
here
we
have
a
market
that,
although
puerto
rico
is
a
secondary
market,
but
we
have
only
about
a
fifth
of
the
tourists
that
come
to
puerto
rico
staying
in
hotels,
and
of
those
that
stay
in
hotels
only
60
to
70
percent
stay
in
hotels
with
casinos.
so,
our
market
out
there
in
puerto
rico,
of
the
tourists,
is
large,
and
how
are
we
going
to
be
able
to
juggle,
how
to
get
to
the
tourists
without
getting
to
the
residents?
and
then,
it's
going
to
be
an
intent
of
whether,
is
it
intended
to
the
residents?
here
is
an
english
supplement,
and
we
are
being
investigated
for
criminal
prosecution
this
time,
not
only
a
fine.
on
the
jurisdictional
question
which
this
court
would
have
me
address,
a
facial
attack
on
section
8
was
properly
raised
at
every
level
of
the
proceeding,
initially
in
the
complaint,
paragraph
9
as
stated,
and
throughout
in
the
notice
of
appeal,
motion
for
rehearing,
and
the
court
acknowledged
that
in
his
own
opinion
when
he
said
that
the
first,
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments
were
applicable
to
the
question
at
bar.
and,
there
are
no
independent
state
grounds
for
dismissal,
expressed,
at
least
on
the
merits...
on
the
face
of
the
judgment
below,
but
rather
that
the
court
dismissed
the
case
for
lack
of
a
substantial
question,
which
is
a
decision
on
the
merits
and
therefore
the
decision
is
final
and
properly
appealable
to
this
court.
due
to
the
time
limitations
we
will
rest
on
our
briefs,
on
the
rest
of
the
jurisdictional
questions,
unless
there
is
some
concern
of
this
court,
and
we
will
move
on
to
the
substantiality
of
the
question,
which
we
think
is
very
substantial
as
it
abridges,
first,
commercial
speech
rights,
it
establishes
a
subclassification
of
casinos
versus
other
legalized
gaming.
the
classification
is
more
suspect
because
it
is
a
content
based
classification
on
speech,
and
it
has
raised
now
that
the
opinion
below
has
come
out
of
a
second
classification
of
residents
versus
non-residents,
in
addition
of
intruding
into
core
speech
rights
because
of
its
overbreadth
and
vagueness,
violated
due
process
guarantees.
the
judgment
below
did
not
put
to
rest
the
issues.
therefore,
we
have
to
look
into
the
merits
of
the
ban
itself
and
whether
the
government
has
met
the
burden
that
at
least
the
central
hudson
test
has
imposed
when
abridgement
of
first
commercial
speech
rights
are
involved.
the
activity
is
constitutionally
protected
because
gaming
has
been
legal
in
puerto
rico
since
1948,
and
there
is
no
suggestion
on
the
record
that
the
information
given
is
false
or
misleading.
whether
the
government
has
had
a
substantial
interest
is
kind
of
vague,
because
the
government
has
advanced
five
substantial
interests
up
to
this
point,
two
in
the
original
complaint
which
was
that
the
tourists
would
be
protected
from
the
patronizing
of
the
residents
of
the
casino,
which
we
fail
to
see
how
that
could
be,
and
also
that
the
puerto
rico
residents
would
not
promote
tourism
and
do
not
contribute
revenues
to
our
economy,
which
is
also
not
a
serious
argument,
i
don't
think.
then,
we
would
say
that
income
tax
from
state
residents
are
not
income
to
the
treasury.
in
its
motion
to
affirm,
it
added
that
the
government
interest
was
to
discourage
the
games
of
chance
so
that
the
puerto
rican
would
earn
his
bread
with
the
sweat
of
his
brow,
but
that
doesn't
seem
to
be
a
substantial
interest
on
the
face
that
the
government
itself
runs
the
state
lottery,
advertises
it,
allows
it,
very
permissive
with
horse
tracks.
it's
very
permissive
with
cockfights,
all
of
which
are
highly
patronized
by
the
puerto
ricans,
while
the
casinos
are
not.
this
court's
level...
for
the
first
time,
a
tourism
company
brings,
a
casino
information
has
no
value
in
our
free
market
society
which
is
contrary
to
the
virginia
holding
and
the
progeny
cases
that
follow,
and
that
advertising
will
lead
to
excessive
casino
gambling
with
no
factual
basis
at
all
on
the
record.
these
changes
in
substantial
government
really
brings
out
the
fact
that
it
seems
that
the
government
is
really
fishing
for
a
substantial
interest
that
will
uphold
its
own
dislike
of
speech
about
gaming.
but
the
true
government
goal,
as
read
from
section
8,
is
a
guard
on
a
legal
speaker
and
the
election
of
public
ignorance
as
a
means
of
controlling
legalized
gambling.
while
the
government
has
in
the
act
means
that
directly
advance,
such
as
minimum
and
maximum
limits,
strict
supervision
on
a
daily
basis,
no
on-premise
alcohol
consumption,
no
minors
allowed,
a
slot
foreman
to
avoid
slot
houses,
criminal
sanctions
for
violating
the
law,
credit
procedures
and
controls,
surveillance,
and
now
irs
reporting
on
the
bank
secrecy
act.
other
non-speech
related
controls
and
affirmative
speech
programs
as
suggested
by
justice
white
may
be
adopted
by
puerto
rico.
that
would
directly
advance
these
roles
which
we
are
not
challenging.
we
do
not
mind
the
strict
regulation
of
gaming.
we
just
don't
think
that
speech
is
the
proper
way
of
doing
that,
without
unduly
burdening
the
franchise
holder
entitled
to
conduct
its
business
by
the
government
inducing
it
for
its
own
economic
benefit.
what
puerto
rico
cannot
do
is
deter
gaming
by
blocking
information
about
gaming
in
any
manner,
if
addressed
to
the
resident,
because
it
is
not
the
least
restrictive
means
tailored
to
that
end.
the
government
has
not
met
its
burden,
not
a
trial,
not
an
argument
which
is
really
not
evidence
that
would
substitute
trial
evidence,
for
a
departure
from
this
court's
precedent
on
commercial
speech.
it
merely
relies
on
the
word
of
section
8,
while
we
introduce
at
least
the
only
study
that
has
ever
been
made
on
gaming
in
puerto
rico,
it's
in
your
brief,
and
which
proves
that
just
the
opposite,
as
soon
as
gaming
was
regulated
in
puerto
rico
the
former
patronizing
of
the
people
of
puerto
rico
of
illegal
casinos,
which
was
100
percent
doing
that,
lost
to
five
percent,
because
of
the
highly
regulated
nature
of
the
gaming
activity
itself
which
is
what
we
advanced.
there
is
no
substantial
evidentiary
ground
for
tourism
to
request,
or
the
government,
that
this
activity
be
placed
outside
of
the
umbrella
of
the
constitution,
together
with
illegal
activities
and
together
with
child
pornography
and
obscenity,
because
it's
none
of
that.
gaming
is
legal
in
puerto
rico,
and
there
is
no
reason
why
this
court
should
backstep
11
years
to
the
bigelow
versus
virginia
era
when
truthful
information
about
legal
activity
was
totally
suppressed,
or
was
able
to
be
totally
possessed.
as
a
matter
of
principle,
a
prophylactic
ban
on
protected
speech
must
withstand
at
least
the
intermediate
scrutiny
of
central
hudson
which
we
just
went
through,
although
we
prefer
the
view
of
the
construction
that
the
constitution
has
made
the
choice
of
keeping
the
people
of
the
united
states
informed
as
long
as
we
are
a
free
enterprise
democracy,
and
section
8
does
not
meet
this
test.
we
would
like
to
keep
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
maria
milagros
soto
no,
it's
a
different
one,
your
honor.
it's
the
old
san
geronimo
hotel.
it's
not
the
condado
beach.
ms.
maria
milagros
soto
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
just
like
to
rely
on
two
points
made
by
brother
counsel,
one
on
the
jurisdictional
question.
it's
completely
meritorious,
the
challenge
that
the
question
was
not
raised
properly
and
that
it
was
a
last-minute
thought
to
bring
a
facial
attack.
it
was
brought
properly.
there
are
specific
references
in
your
record
that
it
was
brought
in
the
complaint,
in
the
notice
of
appeal,
in
the
motion
of
rehearing,
plus
in
the
declaratory
judgment.
it
particularly
reads:
"the
judgment
itself
will
hereby
declare
that
section
8
of
the
law
is
not
conlusive
[inaudible]
from
its
face,
and
is
sustained.
"
"there
was
a
facial
attack
right
from
the
very
beginning
and
right
on,
and
the
constitutional...
by
number,
first,
fifth
and
fourteenth,
recognized
by
the
trial
court
as
being
properly
raised,
with
regards
to
the
merits.
"
what
is
left
of
the
judgment
below
opinion
is
unconstitutional,
because
as
justice
stevens
very
well
brought
out,
and
i
have
it
on
my
notes,
before
i
couldn't
cover
it,
this
opinion
is
subject
to
change.
ana
not
only
is
it
subject
to
change,
it
was
going
to
be
changed
this
year.
this
very
year
it
was
going
to
be
changed
by
the
tourism
company
to
include
only
the
paragraph
a
which
is
the
proscription
that
posadas
or
any
other
gambling
casino
would
advertise
to
the
public
in
puerto
rico,
without
including
all
the
other
exceptions
the
board
had
made,
and
it
can
be
done
at
any
minute
because
the
court
contemplated
the
possibility,
that
if
if
was
regulated,
as
it
was...
certain
regulatory
functions,
they
could
not
take
them
all
together
from
the
agency
and
the
agency
could
change
these
regulations
any
time
it
saw
fit.
so,
therefore,
all
channels
of
communications
to
the
residents
are
still
closed,
they
are
foreclosed,
an
the
section
in
the
paragraph...
in
the
article
that
was
published,
which
by
the
way
it
is
the
same
company
that
manages
both
hotels,
posadas
hotels
and
the
el
san
juan
hotel,
proves
that
the
content
of
this
article
is
not
enticing
the
people
to
come
and
gamble
in
the
casino,
and
it
is
not
paid
publicity,
which
is
what
the
judge
held.
it
is
an
article
covering
all
sorts
of
things
including
job
opportunities,
and
the
people
that
we
want
to
employ
and
where
do
we
recruit
them.
ms.
maria
milagros
soto
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
ms.
maria
milagros
soto
it
is
on
the
record.
it's
particularly...
it's
appendix
d
in
our
reply
brief.
ms.
maria
milagros
soto
no,
it
didn't
happen
before.
it
happened
after.
it
was
duly
authenticated,
the
signature
of
the
secretary
of
justice
through
the
department
of
state,
and
brought
properly
under
rule
201.
ms.
maria
milagros
soto
that
was
a
[inaudible]
question
that
arose
while
the
case
was
being
tried
by
the
judge,
whereby
they
required
a
jacket
to
go
into
the
casinos
to
the
men,
while
they
didn't
require
proper
attire
for
women,
and
the
court
found
that
it
was
unconstitutional.
and
since,
it
has
been
changed.
regulations
have
been
adopted
flexibilizing
the
dress
code.
ms.
maria
milagros
soto
we
have
made
a
claim
but
the
court
became
aware
of
it,
and
thought
it
was
unconstitutional
and--
ms.
maria
milagros
soto
--the
problem...
the
problem
still
exists
with
the
statute
as
construed,
in
addition
that
it
can't
be
changed.
it
subjects
a
casino
franchise
holder
to
self-censorship
all
the
time,
plus
when
it
finally
does
advertise,
that
advertisement
is
going
to
be
judged
on
content.
i
think
either
one
[inaudible]
violates
the
constitution
and
for
such
reason,
we
request
that
this
court
strikes
down
under
section
1258(b)
which
is
properly
raised
on
appeal,
this
case,
the
decision
below.
we
feel
that
yu
cong
eng
rationale,
although
it
is
an
old
case,
is
still
valid.
it
has
been
recently
and
approvingly
cited
in
matthews
versus
heckler
whereby
this
court
entertained
directly
to
evaluate
the
section
challenged
and
the
[inaudible]
broken
down
as
we
think
this
one
should
be.
thank
you.
