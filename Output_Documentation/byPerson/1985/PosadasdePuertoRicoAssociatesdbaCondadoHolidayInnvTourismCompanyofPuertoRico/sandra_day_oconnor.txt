justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what's
left
of
the
statute
now?
is
it
just
the
prohibition
against
advertising
in
the
media
within
puerto
rico
itself?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
it
media
advertising
that
it
now
covers,
as
the
court
below
has
construed
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
if
a
matchbook
with
the
name
of
the
casino
came
into
the
hands
of
a
resident
of
puerto
rico.
is
that
somehow
prohibited
now?
is
that
your
understanding?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
don't
you
think
that
puerto
rico
could
prohibit
gambling
altogether
and
make
it
illegal
because
puerto
rico
could
determine
that
it's
bad
for
the
citizens?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
suppose
you
have
a
state
like
alaska
that
has
legalized
the
use
of
marijuana,
personal
use
of
marijuana.
do
you
think
alaska
can
prohibit
all
advertising
of
marijuana?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
ms.
soto,
i
thought
the
fines
were
imposed
before
the
superior
court
made
its
final
interpretation
of
the
statute?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
just
told
justice
rehnquist
it
was
after.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
was
my
understanding
that
the
determination
of
the
superior
court
when
it
in
effect
rewrote
the
statute,
if
that's
what
it
did,
that
the
judge
did
that
after
all
these
fines
he
did
impose?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
then,
why
shouldn't
we
proceed
with
the
argument
over
what's
left
of
the
statute,
rather
than
what
happened
before?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
didn't--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but,
aren't
we
bound
by
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
by
the
courts
in
puerto
rico?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
the
action
came
from
a
state,
would
we
not
consider
as
binding
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
by
the
court
below?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
the
state
cross-appeal,
or
make
a
cross-filing
here
about
the
court's
interpretation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
so
don't
we...
shouldn't
we
just
follow
the
ruling
of
the
court
below
as
a
matter
of
local
law?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
saldana,
what
do
you
say
is
left
of
the
statute?
exactly
what
conduct,
in
your
view,
does
it
now
prohibit
as
interpreted
by
the
superior
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
saldana,
what
is
this
most
recent
criminal
investigation
that's
going
on
concerning
the
posadas
that
has
arisen
since
the
superior
court
interpretation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right,
and
for
what
activity
is
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
would
it
have
been
all
right
if
they
had
added
in
it
that
local
residents
shouldn't
read
it?
then
it
would
have
been
all
right,
in
your
view?
