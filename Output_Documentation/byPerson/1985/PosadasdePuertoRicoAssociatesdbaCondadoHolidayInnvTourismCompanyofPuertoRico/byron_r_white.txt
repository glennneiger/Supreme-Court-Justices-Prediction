isn't
your
first
amendment
argument
the
same,
though,
whether
the
statute
distinguishes
between
ads
aimed
at
tourists
and
ads
aimed
at
puerto
ricans?
i
mean,
if
the...
suppose
the
statute
forbade
all
ads
about
the
casinos.
justice
byron
r.

well,
it
doesn't
ban
ads
aimed
at
tourists?
justice
byron
r.

while
i
have
you
interrupted,
your
general
submission
is
that
the
first
amendment
requires...
or
forbids
stopping
any
ads
about
any
legal
business?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if...
would
you
say
it
would
be
unconstitutional
for
puerto

if
you
want
to
advertise
casinos,
be
sure
at
the
bottom
say,
this
may
be
dangerous
to
your
pocketbook?

it's
not
illegal
to
smoke.

it's

why,
under
your
argument,
would
a
complete
ban
on
cigarette
advertising
be
bad
or
good?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it
would
be
unconstitutional
then
to
forbid
ads
about
cigarettes,
smoking,
as
long
as
smoking
is
legal?
justice
byron
r.

what
about
marijuana?
