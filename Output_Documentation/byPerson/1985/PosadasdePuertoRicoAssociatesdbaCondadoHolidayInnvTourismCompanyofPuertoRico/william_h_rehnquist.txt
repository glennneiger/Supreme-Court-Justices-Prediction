justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
soto,
didn't
the
superior
court
judge
substantially
restrict
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
when
he
interpreted
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
soto,
were
all
four
of
these
instances
after
the
superior
court
judge
issued
his
ruling?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
are
they
all,
in
the
views
of
your
opponent,
so
far
as
you
know,
consistent
with
the
superior
court's
judge's
ruling?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
all
justice
o'connor
is
asking
about
is
the
matter
of
how
the
statute
is
intended
to
read.
we
have
to
take
the
word
of
the
superior
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
no,
but
as
to
how
broadly
the
statute
sweeps.
there,
we
would
defer
to
the
superior
court,
would
we
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
saldana,
in
the
superior
court's
opinion,
in
its
conclusion
of
law
13,
the
superior
court
said
that
the
first,
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
are
applicable
to
the
controversy.
now,
if
the
superior
court
passes
on
it,
the
fact
that
it
may
not
have
been
properly
raised
does
not
defeat
maintaining
the
claim
here,
i
don't
think.
