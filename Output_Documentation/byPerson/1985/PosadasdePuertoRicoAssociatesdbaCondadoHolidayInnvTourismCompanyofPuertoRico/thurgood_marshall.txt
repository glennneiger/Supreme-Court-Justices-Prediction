soto,
before
you
sit
down,
of
no
importance
but
is
this
the
old
condado
beach
hotel
or
a
new
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
thank
you.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
they
don't
prohibit
them?
the
local
residents
can
go
if
they
want
to?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
does
the
advertisement
say,
"you
legally
can
go
but
we
don't
want
you?
"
[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
in
some
places
it
is.
in
some
places
you
have
to
show
a
passport.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don't
need
a
passport?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there's
no
law
that
prohibits
local
persons
from
gambling
in
a
casino
in
puerto
rico?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
just
as
legal
as
going
to
church?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
you
say
the
average
tourist
in
puerto
rico
knew
there
was
gambling,
before
he
went?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
that
the
reason
he
went,
for
the
average
tourist?
justice
thurgood
marshall
two
or
three.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
tourists
from
the
virgin
islands
go
to
puerto
rico,
other
than
to
gamble?
justice
thurgood
marshall
just
guess.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not
get
rid
of
casino
gambling?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not
get
rid
of
casino
gambling?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you'd
lose
all
the
taxes,
wouldn't
you?
