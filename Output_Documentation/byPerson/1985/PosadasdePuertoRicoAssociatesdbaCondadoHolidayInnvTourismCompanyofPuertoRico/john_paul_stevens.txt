justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
at
this
point.
is
it
correct
that
even
after
the
judge
rewrote
the
statute,
it
still
prohibits
the
use
of
the
word
"casino"?
the
statute
as
reconstrued
by
the
judge
still
prohibits
the
use
of
the
word
"casino"?
justice
john
paul
stevens
one
of
the
incidents
was
being
fined,
as
i
understand
it,
for
this
press
conference
with
the
black
ribbon
across
the
slot
machines
and
so
forth,
and
the
word
"casino"
appeared
in
the
story.
would
that
fine
have
been
imposed
under
the
statute
as
reconstrued,
or--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
may
i
ask
you,
just
on
that
right
now.
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing...
could
they
advertise
in
a
local
newspaper?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
could?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
the
newspaper...
supposing
you
have
a
newspaper
of
general
circulation
in
san
juan.
i
don't
really
know...
and
95
percent
of
the
people
who
subscribe
to
it
are
local
residents,
if
they
put
just
a
big
ad
in
there,
come
to
the
casino
at
such
and
such
hours,
would
that
be
permitted
under
the
statute?
ninety-five
percent
of
the
subscribers
are
local
residents.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
99
percent
of
the
people
who
buy
the
newspaper
are
really
not
tourists,
it's
still
all
right
as
long
as
they
put
in
the
ad,
"nobody
but
tourists
should
read
this
ad?
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
suppose
that
would
be
rather
expensive
advertising
for
one
community
to
have
to
advertise
in
a
national
publication
in
order
to
distribute
locally,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
saldana,
let
me
ask
you
a
question
about
procedure
in
puerto
rico.
as
i
understand
it,
the
supreme
court
of
puerto
rico
entered
an
order
which
did
two
things.
it
said
that
the
appeal
did
not
present
a
substantial
constitutional
question,
and
therefore
dismissed
the
appeal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
secondly,
it
said,
considering
the
writ
filed
as
a
revision,
it
is
denied.
now,
is
the
writ
that
was
denied
something
like
our
certiorari
practice
where
they
have
discretion
to
grant
or
deny
the
writ?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
to
what
extent,
then,
have
they...
is
there
a
precedent?
have
they
adopted
the
reasoning
of
the
trial
court,
or
is
it
just...
they
just
decided
not
to
review
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
to
being
no
constitutional
violation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
not
necessarily
an
affirmance
of
its
interpretation
of
the
statute,
i
take
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
and
the
judgment
in
this
case
granted
no
relief
to
the
plaintiff,
it
just
had
a
long
opinion
reconstruing
the
statute
and
ultimately
dismissed
the
complaint,
didn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
merely
affirmed
the
judgment,
which
was
dismissing
the
complaint,
is
that
right
or
am
i
wrong?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
reasoning?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
saldana,
may
i
ask
you
another
question
about
the
procedure
in
this
case.
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
ends
with
the
statement,
"these
guidelines
may
be
amended
in
the
future
by
the
enforcing
agency
pursuant
to
the
dictates
of
the
changing
needs
and
in
accordance
with
the
law
and
what
is
resolved
herein.
"
and,
i
would
just
like
to
get
your
views
on,
how
firmly
can
we
rely
on
what
the
trial
judge
has
done
here
as
a
definite
rule
for
the
future,
if
he
says...
winds
up
by
saying
the
enforcing
agency
can
change
the
rules?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
says,
"these
guide
regulations
may
be
amended
in
the
future.
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
that's
not
in
the
record,
is
it,
ms.
soto?
that's
not
in
the
record
before
us,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
that
in
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it's
in
your
reply
brief,
but
it
was
not
in
the
record
before
the
trial
court
because
it
didn't
happen
before?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
just
one
more
question
that
puzzles
me
about
the...
what
is
all
this
business
about
the
use
of
jackets
by
men?
what
was
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
that
a
challenge
that
you
and
your
client
had
made
against--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
just
sort
of
threw
it
in
the...
okay.
