mr.
lino
j.
saldana
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
main
issue
here
is
the
validity
of
a
statute
that
restricts
the
advertising
of
casino
gambling
in
puerto
rico,
and
the
first
question
that
we
must
address
is
the
scope
of
the
restriction.
now,
appellant
is
attacking
here
before
this
court
the
statute,
the
23-word
statute,
not
the
statute
as
it
was
interpreted
by
the
superior
court.
and,
of
course,
that
is
the
wrong
approach
because
what
the
statute
means
must
be
determined
by
what
the
superior
court
decided
that
it
means,
and
that
interpretation
is
binding
upon
this
court
as
it
has
been
decided
by
many,
many
precedents
applicable
to
states,
which
are
perfectly
applicable
to
the
puerto
rico
supreme
court...
or
the
commonwealth
court--
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
--that
is
the
question,
precise
question,
that
must
be
addressed
in
the
first
instance.
and
what
is
left
may
be
described
as
follows:
the
superior
court
said
that
no
advertisements
of
casinos
addressed
to
residents
of
puerto
rico
would
be
allowed
in
general,
when
published
in
the
local
media.
but
then,
it
went
on
to
make
a
series
of
exceptions,
even
to
that
general
rule.
it
excepted,
for
example,
advertisements
which
were
distributed
to
residents
if
residents
are
clients
of
the
hotel,
not
even
guests,
but
clients,
just
people
who
are
in
the
hotel
premises.
so,
if
residents
are
in
the
hotel
premises,
there
is
no
restriction
at
all.
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
yes.
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
they
could,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
they
could,
provided
the
advertisement
is
not
addressed
to
residents.
if
the
advertisement
is
addressed
to--
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
--i
would
say
that
if
in
the
advertisement,
your
honor,
it
is
stated
that
this
advertisement
is
addressed
to
tourists
and
not
to
residents,
that
that
leaves
it
permissible.
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
well,
nobody
but
tourists
are
invited
to
visit
the
casino.
because,
that
is
what
the
court
is
prohibiting.
the
court
is
prohibiting
a
casino
from
advertising
to
entice
residents
to
visit
and
gamble
at
its
casino.
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
oh,
yes,
sir.
there
is
no--
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
--no,
they
are
saying,
you
legally
can
go
but
the
demand
for
gambling
among
residents
should
not
be
stimulated
artificially,
should
not
be
increased
by
advertisements
from
casinos.
now,
in
other
jurisdictions,
in
the
bahamas,
in
aruba
and
monaco,
the
laws
prohibit
residents
from
going
to
the
casino,
as
your
honor
has
suggested
that
puerto
rico
may
have
done.
in
england,
for
example,
it
is
not
prohibited
but
advertising
to
local
residents
is
prohibited.
now,
the
advertisement...
the
prohibition
of
local
residents,
the
prohibition
to
visit
or
to
gamble
at
local
casinos
is
perfectly
unworkable,
your
honor.
that
is
why
it
is
not
prohibited
in
puerto
rico,
because
there
are
no
means
of
identifying
who
is
a
tourist
once
they
come
into
the
casino,
and
who
is
a
resident.
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
yes,
but
there
is
no
tourist--
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
--normally
don't
need
passports
in
puerto
rico,
and
we
don't
have
any
id
cards
issued
by
the
government.
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
that
is
true.
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
yes.
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
it
does
not
concern
posadas
at
all.
it
concerns
another
casino
that
is
owned
by
another
company,
which
is
related
to
posadas.
posadas--
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
--the
advertising
appeared
in
a
newspaper
when
the
new
san
juan
hotel
was
opened,
and
the
new
san
juan
hotel
has
a
casino
and
they
published
a
35-page
supplement
in
a
newspaper
about
the
wonderful
new
casino
and
all
of
its
facilities,
and
one
of
the
pages
was
an
advertisement
describing
in
detail
the
gaming
facilities,
how
many
tables,
gaming
tables
they
were,
what
the
roulettes
were,
what
the
card
games
available
there
were,
and
that
it
was
the
best
casino
in
all
the
world.
and
then,
they
published
a
picture--
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
--in
my
view,
if
that
advertisement
had
been
addressed
to
tourists
exclusively,
there
would
be
no
prohibition.
but
the
point
is
that
it
was
not
so
limited.
the
advertisement
was
addressed
to
everybody.
now,
the
court
in
its
interpretation
not
only
permitted
advertising
to
residents
if
they
are
within
the
hotel
premises,
but
permitted
advertising
to
residents
by
all
sorts
of
souvenirs,
match
boxes,
and
other
such
devices,
publicity
devices,
that
freely
circulate
between
residents
or
among
residents.
the
court
also
permitted
advertisements
in
local
magazines
which
are
for...
mainly
for
distribution
to
tourists,
but
if...
the
court
said
they
reach
the
hands
of
residents,
that
doesn't
make
them
legal.
then
it
excluded
completely
all
advertising
outside
the
jurisdiction
of
puerto
rico.
that
is...
referring
now
to
the
question
that
was
put
by
mr.
justice
powell
a
while
ago,
advertising
that
is
published
in
the
new
york
times
which
circulates
in
puerto
rico
every
day,
we
buy
it
every
day
and
we
read
it
and
a
lot
of
persons
read
it.
not
only
in
that...
that
was
just
an
example,
but
in
any
magazine
like
time
magazine
or
newsweek
or
any
other
magazine
in
the
united
states.
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
well,
it
is
a
restriction,
your
honor.
there
is
no...
but
the
advertising
is
not
restricted,
outside
of
the
united
states
is
not
restricted
to
national
advertising.
it
may
be
a
paper
or
a
magazine,
and
there
are
many
of
them,
that
are
published
mainly
for
puerto
ricans
in
new
york
or
puerto
ricans
in
the
states,
the
puerto
rican
communities
in
the
states,
and
these
papers
and
magazines
circulate
in
puerto
rico.
they
are
even
printed
in
spanish,
too.
well,
those
advertisements
are
excluded,
which--
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
--no,
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
so.
there
are
many
tourists--
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
--there
are
many
tourists
that
come
to
puerto
rico
who
are
not
informed,
other
than
maybe
in
a
very
general
way--
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
--yeah,
but...
no,
i
don't
think
so.
your
honor
may
be
thinking
that
most
tourists
come
to
puerto
rico
to
gamble,
and
i
would
seriously
doubt
that
that
is
so.
the--
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
--i
have
no
idea,
your
honor.
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
i
know
that
the
hotels
in
puerto
rico,
there
are
13
gambling
casinos,
ten
of
them
in
the
san
juan
area,
and
three
of
them
outside.
and
they
make
quite
a
publicity
among
tourists
and
they
make
quite
publicity
in
the
virgin
islands,
so
that
they
may
be
enticing
them
to
come
to
san
juan.
i
agree
with
your
honor.
but,
the
point
is
that
this
is
no
absolute
and
complete
ban.
it's...
if
you
take
the
court's...
the
superior
court's
interpretation,
how
can
you
say
that
it
is
an
absolute
ban?
it's
very
relative
ban
of
advertising,
is
very
limited.
it
concerns
only
residents
and
only
to
residents,
to
local
medias.
and,
there
is
also
a
very
general
rule
interpretation
made
by
the
superior
court,
it's
an
important
aspect,
is
that
if
there
is
any
doubt
as
to
whether
an
advertisement
is
addressed
to
a
tourist
or
is
addressed
to
a
resident,
then
it
is
permissible
because
the
court
stated
that
the
general
rule
would
be
that
the
advertising
which
is
addressed
to
tourists
is
completely
exempt
from
the
prohibition.
and
therefore,
i
submit
that
this
is
no
absolute
ban,
and
that's
what
is
before
this
court.
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
yes,
sir.
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
the
rejection
of
the
appeal
for
lack
of
a
substantial
constitutional
question
is
equivalent
to
an
affirmance
of
the
superior
court--
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
--that
is
so.
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
it
is
an
affirmance
of
the...
it
is
like
an
affirmance
by
this
court
of
a
judgment
when
the
appeal
is
summarily
dismissed.
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
it
ultimately
dismissed
the
complaint,
but
in
its
interpretation
it
went
a
very
long
way.
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
well,
it
affirms
the
judgment
and
the
reasoning,
and
the
reasoning
is--
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
--yes.
the
problem,
your
honor,
with
the
jurisdictional
matter
here,
which
i
should
perhaps
have
addressed
first,
is
that
this
is
an
appeal
that
comes
from
the
supreme
court
of
puerto
rico
and
the
validity...
the
record
shows
that
the
validity
of
the
statute
was
not
challenged
at
all
stages
of
the
proceedings.
it
was
not
explicitly
challenged,
and
certainly
it
wasn't
challenged
on
federal
grounds,
because
the
only
mention
of
federal
law
is
the
one
made
before
this
period,
for
the
appellant...
plaintiff
below
referred
to
a
claim
of
right
regarding
what
he
called
his
first
amendment
rights.
it
did
not
even
mention
free
speech,
just
first
amendment
rights,
and
he
claimed
that
the
administrative
interpretation
of
the
law
infringed
his
first
amendment
rights.
now,
he
did
mention
that
there
was
an
equal
protection
right
involved,
the
equal
protection
right
protected
by
the
united
states
constitution.
it
did
not
mention
any
specific
clause
of
the
constitution
whatsoever.
as
to
due
process,
there
was
no
further
claim
at
all
in
the
superior
court.
then,
when
we
come
to
the
supreme
court,
at
the
supreme
court
level
there
was
again
no
specific
claim
of
invalidity
of
the
statute
involved,
and
as
to
appellant's
claims
of
right,
there
was
no
federal
equal
protection
right
claimed.
there
was
no
federal
due
process
right
claimed.
and
as
to
the
other
matter
involved,
other
question
tendered
here
for
appeal,
the
only
reference
was
to
right
of
expression
protected
by
the
bill
of
rights.
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
no,
your
honor.
but
notice,
your
honor,
that
the
superior
court
merely
says
that
it
was
involved,
that
these
clauses
were
involved.
the
superior
court
did
not
even
pass
on
these
matters.
and
the
judgment
issued
by
the
superior
court
was
merely,
we
issue
now
a
declaratory
judgment
concerning
the
interpretation
of
this
statute,
where
federal
rights
are
involved.
but,
the
specific
challenge
to
the
validity
of
the
statute,
to
the
authority
to
enact
the
statute,
was
never
made
before
the
superior
court
and
was
never
made
before
the
supreme
court
either.
now,
the
supreme
court
appeal,
we
have
argued,
was
also
untimely
because
it
was
filed
too
late,
and
the
reply
brief
that
appellant
has
filed
is
very
significant,
in
my
judgment.
it
does
not
present
any
rebuttal
of
the
defects
that
have
been
pointed
out
in
the
appellee's
brief.
it
merely
states,
as
a
naked
statement,
that
the
appellees'
claim
was
properly
presented,
and
then
it
goes
on
to
beg
the
indulgence
of
this
court,
that
the
appellant
was
pressed
for
time,
that
the
appellant
decided
at
the
very
last
moment
to
file
an
appeal
before
the
supreme
court
of
puerto
rico,
and
that
that
was
why
it
didn't
make
things...
it
didn't
do
properly
the
appeal.
it
didn't
raise
the
constitutional
issues
as
it
should
have
done.
but
unfortunately
for
the
appellant,
as
we
all
know,
jurisdictional
requirements
cannot
be
dispensed
with
and
cannot
be
waived.
he
may
have
a
perfect
excuse
otherwise
for
not
doing
the
right
things,
but
if
he
didn't
do
it
then
there
is
no
jurisdiction
and
that
is
what
we
claim.
now,
the...
going
to
the
merits,
i
would
like
to
state
in
simple
terms
our
position.
the
main
position
of
the
appellees
in
this
case
is
that
first
amendment
protection
should
not
be
extended
under
the
commercial
free
speech
doctrine
to
advertising
of
casino
gambling.
and
the
reasons
in
support
of
that
position
are
in
brief,
that
gambling
and
casino
gambling
is
an
activity
that
is
harmful
to
the
community,
that
it
is
a
vice-strewn
activity,
and
that
puerto
rico
should
have
the
power
to
legalize
casino
gambling
if
it
believes
that,
for
example,
it
is
unwise
or
impractical
to
prohibit
it
altogether
because
people
will
gamble
anyway,
or
because
it
expects
to
derive
some
economic
benefit
from
the
legalization
of
casino
gambling,
but
that
there
should
be
no
requirement
that
then
puerto
rico
should
allow
casinos,
to
promote
and
to
actively
advertise
and
market
their
services
and
their
products
so
as
to
create
new
gamblers.
and
the
same
would
apply,
i
would
suppose,
to
the
marijuana
case
that
was
put
by
justice
o'connor,
because
a
state
is
allowed
to
legalize
marijuana
but
it
is
prohibited
from
telling
people,
"don't
advertise
marijuana",
then
new
persons
who
consume
marijuana
will
be
encouraged
to
do
it.
i
mean,
it's
not...
the
state
will
not
be
able
to
limit
the
legalization
to
what
the
existing
demand
for
marijuana
or
gambling
or
casino
gambling
is
at
the
time
that
it
is
legalized.
in
our
case,
the
situation
is
very,
very
difficult
because
there's
no
doubt
that
casino
gambling
is
a
very
dangerous
activity,
that
it
attracts
and
has
attracted,
in
nevada
and
atlantic
city,
it
has
attracted
the
crime
gamblers.
it
has
attracted
organized
crime,
and
provoked
a
host
of
other
problems
concerning
law
and
order
including
among
others
the
corruption
of
government
officials,
as
the
abscam
investigation
showed
in
atlantic
city
where
the
senior
senator,
federal
senator
was
involved
in
taking
bribes.
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
well,
i
interpret
that,
your
honor,
to
mean
that
the
enforcing
agency
can
change...
can
adopt
new
rules
as
to
things
that
are
not
decided
in
the
opinion,
but
the
court
was
not
telling
the
enforcing
agency,
"you
can
change
my
judgment",
because
they
it
would
be
a
nullity.
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
well,
yes,
i
interpret
that,
that
they
may
be
amended
to
include
new
things,
to
make
new
provisions,
but
that
the
judgment
it
renders,
the
declaratory
judgment,
is
of
course
valid
and
binding
between
appellant
and
the
tourism
company.
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
now,
we...
going
back
to
the
merits,
the
issue
here
is
simple
in
a
sense.
if
puerto
rico
cannot
prohibit
the
marketing
and
advertising
of
casino
gambling,
then
it
is
faced
with
a
tremendous
problem
because
the
experience
in
nevada
and
atlantic
city
shows
that
when
you
open
up
the
floodgates
of
advertising
and
promotion,
the
casinos,
the
gambling
casinos
take
over.
they
take
over
as
in
nevada
where
the
principal
industry
is
casino
gambling.
they
take
over
because
they
exercise
such
a
tremendous
influence.
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
i'm
sorry,
i--
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
--yes,
so
that
the
only
alternative
would
be
to
get
rid
of
casino
gambling,
because
i
believe
that
puerto
rico--
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
--we
lose...
we
would
lose,
your
honor,
not
only
the
taxes
but
the
help
that
casino
gambling
tourists
give
to
the
tourism
industry
in
puerto
rico.
but
i
believe
that
it
would
be
preferable,
and
i
believe
that
puerto
rico
would
find
it
preferable
to
ban
completely
casino
gambling
rather
than
let
them
advertise
without
limit,
and
let
them
advertise
and
market
and
create
new
gamblers
and
create
new
demand,
and
follow
the
pattern
and
the
model
of
nevada
and
atlantic
city
where
it's
an
incessant
cycle
of
growth
for
these
people.
they
grow,
they
promote
an
increased
level
of
demand
and
then
they
expand
and
they
grow,
and
then
they
again
promote
the
demand,
and
finally
what
they
do
is
they
take
over
the
state.
well,
puerto
rico
does
not
want
to
be
another
nevada
