chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
afternoon
in
united
states
against
koecher.
mr.
wright,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
position
in
this
case
is
that
the
privilege
falls
if
they
are
accomplices
in
the
criminal
activity.
isn't
that
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
lynch.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
there
have
been
a
lot
of
changes
in
recent
years,
have
there
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
there
any
occasion
to
abolish
it
completely
in
trammel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
question
wasn't
presented
to
us
on
the
broad
basis.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
in
these
cases,
did
the
court
not...
the
court's
opinion
not
point
out
that
the
root
of
this
whole
idea
went
back
to
the
time
when
the
woman
was
nothing,
the
woman
was
merged
into
the
man
when
they
were
married?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
much
do
you
rest
on
the
proposition
that
for
the
one
spouse
to
testify
against
the
other
would
undermine
the
marriage
relationship?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
court
orders
the
spouse
to
testify,
doesn't
that
eliminate
that
fact?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
the
spouse
is
given
the
choice
of
pleasing
her
husband
or
going
to
prison.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
on
the
other
hand,
doesn't
this
give
the
man
or
the
woman
an
advantage
over
all
other
criminals,
that
if
you
take
your
husband
or
your
wife
in
and
commit
the
crime,
then
you
have
got
a
preferred
witness
status?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don't
think
that
encourages
joint
crimes
by
husband
and
wife?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
before
you
go
on
to
a
new
point,
let
me
see
if
i
can
get
your
picture
clear
in
mind.
the
husband
and
wife
engaged
in
a
joint
criminal
activity,
and
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
it
is
importing
cocaine
or
robbing
a
bank
or
whatever,
i
assume.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
the
wife
is
called
before
the
grand
jury.
and
the
husband
doesn't
want
her
to
testify,
of
course.
she
is
instructed
by
the
court
presiding
over
the
grand
jury
that
she
must
answer
or
go
to
prison.
now,
you
suggest
it
impairs
the
marriage
relationship
if
the
husband
is
willing
to
let
her
go
to
prison
rather
than
answer
the
questions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
hear
what
you
are
saying.
you
say
they
put
the
spouses
against
each
other.
when
did
that
begin?
when
they
called
her
to
the
grand
jury
or
when
the
criminal
acts
began?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
ordinarily,
if
two
people
go
into
a
criminal...
two
or
three
people
go
into
a
criminal
enterprise,
there
is
the
risk
that
they
may
be
pitted
against
one
another,
and
it
often
happens
that
one
will
testify
against
the
other
in
exchange
for
some
lesser
sentence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wait
a
minute.
you
have
the
sequence
wrong.
the
sequence
was
that
if
she
was
willing
before
she
was
under
any
compulsion
of
any
kind
from
that
opinion,
if
she
was
willing,
then
probably
there
wasn't
much
left
of
that
marriage.
now,
let's
take
that
same
proposition.
the
husband
is
saying
to
the
wife,
don't
testify,
but
then
she
answers,
they
are
going
to
make
me
testify
or
go
to
prison,
and
he
says,
all
right,
go
to
prison.
how
much
is
left
of
that
marriage?
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
in
some
sense
that
is
exactly
my
point,
but
in
another
way
i
think
it
misconceives
the
situation.
let
me
try
to
explain.
well,
just
answer
the
specific
question.
do
you
think
he
has
got
a
right
to
let
her
go
to
prison?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
is
calling...
in
a
sense,
you
are
letting
his
willingness
to
have
her
go
to
prison--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--mr.
lynch--
--we
are
speaking
now
of
what
kind
of
a
marriage
relationship
is
left
between
these
two
people
if
he
says,
in
effect,
not
openly,
as
under
trammel,
where
the
breach
was
there,
all
right,
you
go
to
jail.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
husband
is
not...
has
a
right
to
say
that
even
if
you
are
being
compelled
to
do
this,
i
am
through
with
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that
is
what
he
is
doing.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--how
long
ago
did
he
first
say
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
may
be
true.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
position
you
advocate...
i
will
put
it
in
the
form
of
a
question.
does
not
your
position
say
to
a
man
who
is
criminally
inclined
and
he
is
going
to
start
importing
heroin
and
cocaine
from
colombia
that...
he
has
got
to
have
some
help,
and
so
isn't
it
safer
on
your
theory,
then,
to
have
your
wife
be
your
helper
instead
of
some
other
criminal
type?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
by
reason
of
the
law
you
are
advocating,
it
is
certainly
a
great
inducement
to
take
your
wife,
because
she
can
never
turn
state's
evidence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
that
kind
of
a
relationship
at
the
starting
point.
i
am
not
talking
about
the
relationship
that
has
broken
down,
as
in
trammel.
you
are
suggesting
that
the
relationship
will
break
down
because
she
testifies.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
it
she
is
compelled
to
testify.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
you
want
the
government
to
break
up
the
marriage,
not
the
parties.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
maybe
the
government
will
adopt
your
guidance
in
this
case
if
you
prevail.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
wright,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
may
i
ask,
mr.
wright,
under
your
view,
if
you
prevail...
say
you
have
a
case
in
which
the
spouses
were
joint
participants
for
about
a
year
or
two
years,
say.
would
you
inquire
of
the
spouse
for
the
period
before
she
joined
the
conspiracy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
