mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
government
today
is
asking
this
court
to
do
something
that
it
has
never
done
before,
to
put
a
woman
in
prison
for
refusing
to
testify
in
a
criminal
matter
against
her
husband
of
22
years,
and
despite
mr.
wright's
emphasis
on
the
particular
questions
that
were
asked
in
this
case,
there
is
no
question
but
that
any
testimony
given
by
mrs.
koecher
in
this
investigation
could
well
have
led
to
potential
incrimination
of
her
husband.
there
is
no
question
but
that
the
grand
jury
was
continuing
to
investigate
mr.
koecher
as
well...
that
is
the
finding
of
fact
below...
with
a
view
to
possibly
bringing
further
charges
against
him.
the
government's
demand
today
is
truly
extraordinary.
for
more
than
400
years
the
courts
of
both
great
britain
and
the
united
states
have
held
that
out
of
respect
for
the
sacred
unity
of
marriage
the
common
law
does
not
permit
a
person
to
be
compelled
to
testify
against
his
or
her
spouse.
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
there
have
been
changes
in
the
marital
privilege
in
recent
years.
i
would
submit
that
one
of
the...
there
are
two
that
are
particularly
significant.
one
is
the
change
this
court
made
in
the
trammel
decision
a
few
years
ago.
in
trammel,
this
court
essentially
removed
the
principal
basis
on
which
the
marital
privilege
had
been
criticized
before.
that
is,
before
the
trammel
decision
the
rule
had
been
that
the
defendant
spouse
had
the
right
to
block
his
or
her
spouse
from
testifying,
so
that
the
privilege
resided
in
the
defendant,
usually
the
husband,
who
would
then
prevent
a
willing
wife
from
testifying
against
him.
that
was
the
essential
basis
on
which
the
marital
privilege
had
been
criticized,
and
that
has
gone--
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
--that
part
of
the
privilege
goes
all
the
way
back
as
well,
justice
white.
that
is
correct.
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
you
changed
it.
it
took
400
to--
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
--and
i
don't
think
we
need
to
make
another--
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
--in,
i
guess
the
rules
of
evidence
were
promulgated
in
about
1972
by
this
court,
and
then
by
congress
a
few
years
later.
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
that's
right.
this
court--
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
--oh,
there
is
no
question
about
it,
your
honor.
we
agree
with
that
absolutely.
this
court
had
recommended
to
congress--
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
--oh,
no
not
at
all.
not
at
all,
justice
white.
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
absolutely,
although
i
do
think
that
as
the
chief
justice
said
in
his
opinion
for
the
court
in
trammel,
that
this
court
should
be
very
cautious
before
changing
rules
of
privilege
that
go
back
as
far
as
this
one
does,
and
particularly
where
those
rules
of
privilege
trench
on
matters
respecting
the
family.
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
absolutely,
justice
white,
and
i
think
that--
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
--excuse
me?
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
that
certainly
is
caution,
but
what
the
court
did
in
trammel,
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
was
to
really
undermine
the
basis
for
the
principal
criticism
of
the
marital
privilege.
the
argument
that
mr.
wright
made,
for
example,
about
recruiting
spouses
as
co-conspirators
had
particular
force
at
a
time
when
if
the
spouse
became
a
co-conspirator
the
spouse
could
never
testify
whether
or
not
she
was
ultimately
willing
to
because
the
defendant
could
block
it.
but
that
is
gone
in
trammel.
that
was
the
big--
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
--nineteen.
thirty-one
states
retained
it.
interestingly
enough,
not
one
of
those
31
states
by
legislation,
common
law,
or
any
other
process
has
ever
adopted
the
exception
for
which
the
government
contends
in
this
case.
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
well,
insofar
as
the
government's
position
in
this
case
makes
no
sense
whatever,
it
seems
to
me
that
abolishing
the
privilege
might
be
more
sensible
than
that,
but
abolishing
the
privilege
is
a
step
that
this
court
has
refused
to
take,
not
400
years
ago,
but
in
hawkins
in
1958,
in
trammel,
and
in
its
recommendations
to
congress
with
respect
to
the
federal
rules
of
evidence.
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
well,
in
trammel,
mr.
chief
justice,
as--
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
--well,
the
government
didn't
argue
for
the
abolition
of
the
privilege
there,
just
as
the
government
does
not
argue
for
the
abolition
of
the
privilege
here.
it
is
exactly
the
same
posture
in
that
respect.
the
government
did
urge
a
broader
ground
than
this
one
in
that
case.
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
yes,
i
think
that
is
an
important
point,
mr.
chief
justice.
at
one
time,
the
woman's
position
in
marriage
was,
as
you
say,
as
a
nullity,
and
the
privilege
does
indeed
have
its
roots
in
that
time,
but
the
essential
insight
that
the
privilege
represents,
indeed,
the
essential
insight
that
lies
behind
the
erroneous
conception
that
the
wife
was
a
nullity
is
one
that
was
valid
then
and
is
valid
now,
as
this
court
said
in
hawkins.
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
well,
that
is
what
this
court
said
in
hawkins.
i
think
that
that
is
an
accurate
perception.
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
i
don't
think
it
does
at
all,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
the
spouse
certainly
has
an
excuse,
as
it
were,
in
the
moral
court
in
which
she
would
have
to
argue
with
her
husband.
but
i
would
suggest
that
that
excuse
wouldn't
carry
much
weight
in
that
kind
of
court.
that
is
to
say,
the
way
i
would
prefer
to
state
the
insight
that
this
court
expressed
in
hawkins
is
not
so
much
that
compelled
testimony
would
destroy
the
marriage
as
that
compelled
testimony
is
inconsistent
with
the
very
basis
of
marriage,
the
very
nature
of
marriage.
what
the
court
would
be
compelling
a
spouse
to
do
if
the
marital
privilege
were
abolished
is
to
betray
a
husband.
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
no,
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
i
don't
think
that
is,
with
all
respect,
a
particularly
realistic
way
to
look
at
marriage.
the
assumption
that
spouses
tend
to
recruit
each
other
to
be
in
each
other's
crimes
because
that
would
be
a
good
person
to
have
in
the
crime
because
they
have
a
privilege,
that
is
not,
it
seems
to
me,
the
way
it
works.
if
there
is
any
tendency
for
spouses
to
recruit
each
other
to
be
in
crimes,
it
stems
from
two
basic
facts.
the
spouse
is
the
person
closest
to
the
person
contemplating
the
crime.
and
secondly,
if
there
is
any
assumption
that
the
spouse
isn't
going
to
testify,
it
doesn't
come
from
the
law.
it
comes
from
the
same
assumption
that
i
suppose
co-conspirators
often
indulge,
that
people
that
they
trust
will
not
betray
them.
i
think
that
is
particularly...
a
particularly
strong
force
where
those
people
are
married,
and
i
don't
think
it
is
one
that
the
law
can
really
do
much
to
change.
i
think
if
we
look
realistically
at
the
government's
suggestion
that
important
evidence
is
being
lost
because
of
the
marital
privilege
in
joint
participant
or
any
other
circumstances,
it
will
not
bear
scrutiny.
the
government
has
pointed
to
not
a
single
case
from
the
seventh
or
tenth
circuit
in
which
any
evidence
was
ever
obtained
by
compelling
a
spouse
to
testify
before
a
grand
jury
or
anywhere
else.
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
well,
i
am
sorry,
justice
rehnquist,
if
you
think
that
i
overstressed
that
point,
but
i
do
think
that
the
essence
of
marriage,
as
this
court
said
in
griswald
against
connecticut,
is
bilateral
loyalty.
what
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
is
that
if
there
is
any
analogous
privilege,
and
the
government
places
great
stress
on
various
other
privileges,
it
is
not
the
attorney-client,
it
is
not
even
the
marital
confidential
communications
privilege,
it
is
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
there
is
no
other
privilege
that
exists
in
our
law,
which
is
like
the
marital
testimonial
privilege
in
giving
a
witness
the
blanket
right
to
refuse
to
testify
against
some
other
person.
an
attorney
doesn't
have
a
privilege
not
to
testify
against
his
client.
the
attorney
has
the
privilege
not
to
testify...
in
fact,
more
accurately,
the
client
has
the
privilege
to
prevent.
but
the
privilege
is
not
to
testify
about
the
particular
narrow
kind
of
communication.
that
is
what
the
marital
confidential
communications
privilege
is
like,
too.
that
is
very
different
from
this
situation.
in
those
situations,
it
makes
sense
to
say
that
if
a
particular
kind
of
communication,
one,
for
example,
in
furtherance
of
crime,
is
not
within
the
nature
of
the
kinds
of
communications
we
are
encouraging
by
the
privilege,
then
the
privilege
shouldn't
apply.
the
privilege
we
have
got
here
is
a
blanket
sort
of
privilege,
and
as
i
say,
the
only
analogy
to
it
is
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
it
is
the
only
situation
where
a
person
can
say
within
the
law
that
my
loyalty
to
another
person
is
sufficient
to
justify
my
never
testifying
against
them.
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
that's
right.
in
the
marital
situation,
and
this
goes
back
to
the
chief
justice's
comment
a
moment
ago
about
the
roots
of
the
marital
privilege,
the
roots
of
the
marital
privilege
lay
in
the
metaphor,
perhaps,
that
husband
and
wife
are
one.
now,
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out,
that
metaphor
has
certainly
been
maliciously
applied
in
some
circumstances
to
undermine
the
separate
position
of
a
woman,
for
example,
separate
right
to
property,
and
things
of
that
sort.
but
the
basic
insight
underlying
that
metaphor,
that
husband
and
wife,
for
one,
is
not
something
that
is
oppressive
to
women.
it
is
not
something
that
died
in
the
14th
century.
it
is
something
that
i
think
is
with
us
today.
the
nature
of
the
marital
relationship
is
that
it
is
the
relationship
society
recognizes
in
which
people
are
closely
bound
to
each
other.
what
the
government
is
asking
for--
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
--yes,
the
short--
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
--the
short
answer
to
that--
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
--justice
marshall--
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
--it
is
longer
and
different
in
a
number
of
other
respects.
but
i
am
afraid
the
short
answer
to
that
is
simply
that
our
tradition
has
never
recognized
that
particular
privilege.
our
tradition
has
always
recognized--
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
--that
is
right.
i
am
certainly
not
here
to
argue
one
way
or
the
other
as
to
whether
the
privilege
should
be
extended
to
other
situations.
that
is
not
implicated
in
this
case
at
all.
put
in
the
situation
where
the
common
law
has
always
recognized
the
privilege,
even
the
government
is
not
here
asking
that
this
court
abolish
the
privilege.
that
issue
hasn't
been
briefed
and
isn't
raised
by
the
government.
what
they
are
asking
for
is
something
that
is
the
law
nowhere.
they
are
not
asking
for
this
court
to
follow
those
19
states
that
have
put
the
marital
privilege
aside.
they
are
asking
this
court
to
do
something
that
no
legislature
has
ever
done.
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
there
are
analogies
there,
but
as
i
was
suggesting
before,
justice
rehnquist,
those
are
not
true
analogies,
because
the
nature
of
those
privileges
is
different.
the
reason
for
the
exception
is
different,
and
the
way
in
which
the
exception
works
is
different.
after
all,
in
all
of
those
cases,
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
they
are
much
narrower
privileges
to
start
with
and
they
have
a
different
set
of
rationales,
all
of
those
privileges
are
ones
that
can
be
asserted
as
the
marital
privilege
used
to
be
able
to
be
asserted
by
the
defendant.
that
is,
if
the
client
is
on
trial
and
the
attorney
is
going
to
testify
about
a
confidential
communication,
the
client
can
prevent
that
from
happening.
that
does
create
a
situation,
it
seems
to
me,
in
which
it
could
be
said
that
the
client
could
exploit
the
lawyer,
could
use
the
lawyer
for
a
criminal
purpose,
wittingly
or
unwittingly,
by
the
way.
the
lifting
of
the
privilege
doesn't
depend
on
the
attorney's
involvement
or
mental
state.
it
turns
on
what
the
client
was
trying
to
do.
if
the
exception
to
the
privilege
were
not
available
there,
the
client
could
use
the
attorney
to
commit
a
crime,
could
make
communications
in
furtherance
of
a
crime,
and
then
prevent
that
from
ever
coming
out.
that
is
not
the
case
here.
here,
if
the
wife
is
willing
to
testify,
the
defendant
spouse
cannot
prevent
her
ever
from
testifying.
that
is
the
benefit
that
this
court
obtained
for
law
enforcement
in
trammel,
and
that
seems
to
me
distinguishes,
among
other
things,
the
differences
between--
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
--i
hope
i
am
not
sounding
that
way,
justice
white.
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
well,
i
think
no
one
else
has
ever
taken
this
approach
because
this
approach
just
doesn't
make
sense.
it
isn't
the
case
that
you
can
adequately
distinguish
the
joint
participant
case
from
any
other
case
of
marital
privilege.
perhaps
it
is
a
good
idea
to
turn
directly
to
that
situation.
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
or
income
tax
evasion.
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
i
am
suggesting
that
it
is...
it
presents
a
conflict,
first
of
all,
within
the
conscience
of
the
spouse
that
puts
the
marital
relationship
under
tremendous
strain,
and
secondly,
that
if
the
wife
does
testify,
essentially
what
the
court
has
done
in
that
situation
and
and
what
the
law
has
done
in
that
situation
is
to
turn
the
spouses
directly
against
each
other.
the
spouse
becomes
a
witness
for
the
prosecution
against
the
spouse,
and
that
seems
to
be--
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
--well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
see
that
the
spouses
were
pitted
against
each
other
at
any
earlier
point
than
the
point
at
which
one
of
them--
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
--and
as
this
court
recognized
in
trammel,
the
very
reason
why
mrs.
trammel
in
that
case
could
be
permitted
to
testify
despite
the
prior
history
of
there
being
a
privilege
that
would
prevent
her
testifying,
the
very
reason
was
that
her
decision
to
take
that
option,
her
decision
to
become
a
witness
for
the
prosecution
had
undermined
the
marriage.
there
was
no
longer,
this
court
said
in
trammel,
obviously,
this
court
said,
there
was
no
longer--
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
--i
don't
think
it
is
his
right.
i
think
that
is
the
point.
i
think
it
is
her
decision
what
to
do.
i
don't
think
we
have
a
situation
here.
certainly
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
here,
and
there
is
nothing
in
my
understanding
of
modern
relationships
between
husband
and
wife
that
says
that
the
husband
calls
the
shot
as
to
whether
or
not
the
wife
testifies.
it
is
the
wife's
decision.
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
well,
he
doesn't
have
much
say
in
the
matter.
she
will
go
to
prison
based
on
her
decision
and
the
court's
decision,
not
based
on
anything
that
he
has
to
do
about
it.
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
we
may
have
some
misunderstanding,
but
i
guess
i
think
that
is
my
point.
my
point
is,
there
is
nothing
left
of
the
marriage
after
the
court
puts
the
wife
in
the
position
where
she
has
to
choose
between
whether
to
go
to
jail
and
uphold
her
loyalty
to
her
husband
or
whether
to
testify
against
him.
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
i
don't...
well,
i
suppose,
yes,
he
clearly
does
have
that
right,
because--
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
--but
i
don't
think--
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
--that
is
exactly
right,
justice
stevens.
that
is
to
say,
what
puts
everyone
in
that
position,
the
very
position
that
i
think
the
chief
justice
finds
distressing
here
in
this
relationship
between
the
parties
is
that
the
wife
is
compelled
to
testify.
if
she
is
not
compelled
to
testify,
we
never
reach
the
point
of
having
exactly
that
kind
of
marital
conflict.
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
well,
every
spouse
who
has
ever
been
compelled
under
this
exception,
which,
granted,
is
a
small
number,
has
taken
that
option.
that
is
what
mrs.
koecher
did.
she
went
to
jail.
this
is
not
a
case
where
there
has
been
a
stay,
and
this
is
a
theoretical
issue.
mrs.
koecher
went
to
jail
and
spent
four
months
there
before
being
released
on
bail
after
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
well,
the
government
tells
us
there
are
no
typical
examples,
because
despite
the
enormous
benefits
they
expect
to
accrue
to
law
enforcement,
they
tell
us
that
in
the
12
years
since
this
idea
was
first
thought
up
in
van
drunin
by
the
seventh
circuit,
we
haven't
had
an
adequate
basis
to
decide
what
the
empirical
effect
of
it
is
because
it
is
too
short
a
time
and
it
doesn't
come
up
very
often.
the
two
times
that
it
has
come
up
are
in
the
case
of
united
states
against
clark
in
the
seventh
circuit
and
in
this
case,
and
in
both
of
those
cases
the
spouse
went
to
jail
rather
than
to
testify.
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
i
don't
know
for
certain.
however,
it
probably
was
the
full
18
months
that
is
permitted,
because
of
the
situation
there.
clark
was
a
petty
embezzler
of
some
kind,
and
he
had
engaged
in
a
scheme
with
his
wife.
clark,
unlike
mrs.
koecher,
was
convicted
by
a
jury
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
having
participated
in
the
crime.
his
wife
was
also
under
indictment.
the
government
then
sought
to
compel
him
to
testify,
saying
he
is
a
joint
participant
and
he
has
been
proven
to
be
so.
he
was
already
under
sentence,
and
as
you
know,
a
contempt
citation
interrupts
the
running
of
the
sentence,
so
presumably
his
contempt
sentence
ran
for
as
long
as
it
was,
and
then
he
continued
with
the
sentence
he
was
serving.
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
i
am
not
sure
what
that
experience
shows.
i
don't
know
how
many
cases
there
are
in
which
it
is
used.
one
of
the
other
things
the
government
says
is
that
the
united
states,
and
i
presume
this
is
true
for
state
prosecutors
as
well,
is
charpy
about
using
his
power.
i
don't
know
how
many
cases
there
are,
and
i
don't
know
what
has
happened--
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
--i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
justice
white.
i
believe
that
most
of
them
have
done
it
by
legislation.
let
me--
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
--curiously,
justice
white,
i
think
probably
not,
although
i
can't
answer
that
definitely
not.
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
not
at
all.
there
are
trends
and
eddies
in
these
matters.
the
government
says
the
distinguished
commentators
go
their
way.
i
think
by
that
they
mean
the
old
commentators.
the
government
doesn't
cite
any
authority--
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
--indeed,
that
is
something
like
what
happened
here.
wigmore
in
his
treatise
said
the
marital
privilege
doesn't
make
much
sense,
and
that
was
taken
as
the
scholarly
view.
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
about
1903,
i
think,
was
when
he
made
that.
what
the
government
doesn't
point
out
is
that
in
our
brief
we
present
the
court
with
a
comprehensive
survey
of
academic
writing
on
this
subject
since
about
1960.
not
a
simple
academic
commentary
since
the
trammel
decision
and
since
this
court's
decisions
on
family
privacy
has
either
adopted
the
government's
position.
i
would
have
thought
you
could
find
an
academic
who
says
anything,
but
nobody
supports
the
government's
position
in
this
case.
or
who
supports
wigmore
and
continues
to
argue
that
the
marital
privilege
should
be
adopted.
now,
the
government's
response
to
that
is
to
pluck
two
stray
statements
from
two
of
those
articles,
of
which
there
are
about
a
dozen,
and
say,
well,
those
are,
you
know,
those
academic
say
weird
things.
but
the
point
is--
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
--i
have
no
doubt
about
it,
although,
as
i
say,
none
of
them
says
anything
as
weird
as
what
the
government
says
in
this
case.
what
the
government
says
in
this
case
has
never
been
adopted
by
the
highest
court
of
any
jurisdiction,
as
a
matter
of
common
law
interpretation.
it
has
never
been
adopted
by
any
legislature.
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
well,
that
is
true,
although
as
i
understand
it
i
don't--
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
--yes.
i
don't
know,
though,
justice
stevens,
of
many
states
that
don't
have
at
least
some
kind
of
immunity
available
in
some
situations,
so
i
don't
think
that
that
is
what
is
preventing
it.
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
if
it
is,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
is
only
because...
by
reason
of
nature,
not
by
reason
of
anything
the
law
does.
i
would
think
that
it
is--
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
--no,
that
is
not
true
after
trammel.
she
can
turn
state's
evidence.
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
well,
or
alternatively,
as
in
trammel,
that--
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
--yes,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
always
the
safest
person
to
recruit
to
be
your
co-conspirator
is
someone
who
will
be
devoted
to
your
interests,
who
loves
you,
who
won't
turn
you
in.
that
is
true
whether
there
is
a
privilege
or
not,
and
i
would
think
it
would
be
a
rather
foolish
person
who
would
put
his
trust
not
in
the
fact
that
he
thinks
his
wife
will
never
betray
him,
but
in
the
fact
that
he
thinks
his
wife
will
never
betray
him
and
get
away
with
it.
after
all,
because
of
the
immunity
situation,
what
you
have
to
understand
is
that
the
contempt
sanction
is
not
the
principal
weapon
that
the
government
could
bring
to
bear
on
a
true
joint
participant.
if
a
spouse
is
truly
a
joint
participant,
and
the
government
has
any
hope
of
proving
it
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
they
can
do
to
that
spouse
precisely
what
they
do
to
every
other
co-conspirator.
they
can
threaten
her
with
prosecution,
which
they
would
have
every
right
to
bring
if
she
is
guilty
of
a
crime,
and
offer
that
they
will
forego
that
option
if
she
persists
in
her
refusal
to
cooperate.
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
there
are
two
important
differences
between
that
situation
and
this
one.
one
is
that
the
spouse
remains
free
to
make
her
own
choice
in
that
situation.
there
is
no
legal
compulsion
on
her
to
testify.
the
second
is
that
what
the
government
is
threatening
in
that
circumstances
is
something
it
has
every
right
to
do,
that
is,
to
bring
a
criminal
prosecution
that
is
warranted,
to
go
before
a
jury
and
to
prove
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
that
is
the
difference
between
the
trammel
circumstances
and
this
one.
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
i
imagine
they
might
try,
although
certainly
if
one
looks
to
the
evidence
they
have
produced
so
far,
it
is
clear
what
is
going
on
in
this
case.
it
is
clear
that
the
government
does
not
have
evidence
which
they
could
present
to
a
grand
jury
to
get
an
indictment
and
then
go
before
a
jury
and
convict
mrs.
koecher
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
only
evidence
that
they
have
ever
offered
in
this
case
with
respect
to
joint
participation
are
hearsay
statements
presented
by
an
agent,
ostensibly
made
by
her
husband,
culled
from
about
ten
days
of
interrogation.
her
husband
is
obviously
not
available
as
a
witness
against
her.
they
have
not
offered
him
immunity
to
testify
against
her.
there
is
no
independent
evidence
that
they
could
bring
in
to
convict
her.
failing
an
ability
to
punish
her
for
what
they
think
she
did,
the
government
prefers
to
offer
her
immunity,
bring
her
before
a
grand
jury,
and
then
punish
her
not
for
the
espionage
they
claim
was
committed,
but
for
loyalty
to
her
husband
for
refusing
to
testify.
what
i
have
been
urging
here
is
not
a
radical
innovation.
it
is
not,
as
in
branzburg
against
hayes,
the
creation
by
this
court
of
a
new
constitutionally
based
privilege.
what
i
am
asking
is
that
this
court
follow
the
common
law
as
it
has
always
existed.
i
am
asking
the
court
to
deny
the
government's
effort
in
this
case,
to
create
an
exception
that
is
a
total
innovation,
to
create
that
exception
not
based
on
reason,
and
certainly
not
based
on
any
experience,
because
they
tell
us
that
they
have
no
experience
to
offer
this
court
suggesting
that
the
operation
of
this
exception
in
the
two
circuits
where
it
has
operated
has
produced
any
benefits
for
law
enforcement.
they
speculate
in
mr.
wright's
argument
that
the
marital
privilege
shields
third
parties.
mr.
wright
says,
well,
what
about
narcotics
conspiracies?
if
we
have
the
privilege
operating
in
this
situation,
we
will
never
be
able
to
prosecute,
but
that
is
nonsense.
the
government
prosecutes
these
narcotics
conspiracies
every
day.
it
prosecutes
large
ones.
mr.
gerard
e.
lynch
i
absolutely
oppose
getting
rid
of
it
altogether.
that
is
not
what
the
government
has
asked
in
this
case.
that
issue,
i
think,
is
not
properly
before
the
court,
but
i
think
it
follows
from
everything
i
have
said
here
and
everything
we
have
said
in
our
brief,
that
we
believe
it
would
be
a
dreadful
mistake
for
the
court
to
go
beyond
what
the
government
asks
and
take
on
essentially
an
outdated
view
of
the
marital
privilege.
thank
you.
