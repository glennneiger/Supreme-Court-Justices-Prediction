how
much
of
a
showing
do
you
have
to
make
at
the
grand
jury
level
that
the
wife
is
a
part
and
parcel
of
the
work
of
the
husband?
justice
thurgood
marshall
like
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
there
is
serious
doubt
in
my
mind
because
she
is
innocent
until
proved
guilty.
justice
thurgood
marshall
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
right?
justice
thurgood

i
mean,
i
am
just
wondering
why,
under
normal
circumstances
you
can't
do
it,
so
all
you
do
is
charge
her
as
a
co-conspirator,
and
then
automatically
they
lose
the
privilege.
justice
thurgood
marshall
may
i
ask,
on
your
trammel
case,
you
have
not
mentioned
what
judge
friendly
said
about
it.
judge
friendly
went
into
the
trammel
case
and
found
it
didn't
apply
didn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
had
no
trouble
with
saying
that
it
didn't
apply
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
was
waiting
to
hear
you.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
shouldn't
you
have
one
on
parent
and
child?
we
can
make
a
mother
testify
against
her
son.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
kind
of
close,
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
relationship
is
longer
than
the
marital
relationship.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
what
trammel
said.
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
you
claim
the
privilege
if
i
asked
you,
do
you
oppose
getting
rid
of
it
altogether?
