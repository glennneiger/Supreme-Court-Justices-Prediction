mr.
christopher
j.
wright
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
in
november
of
1984,
respondent
was
called
before
a
grand
jury
investigating
espionage,
and
asked
three
questions:
whether
she
had
ever
met
with
agents
of
the
czechoslovak
intelligence
service;
whether
she
had
ever
delivered
classified
documents
relating
to
the
national
security
of
the
united
states
to
those
agents;
and
whether
she
had
ever
been
paid
for
the
delivery
of
those
documents.
she
refused
to
answer,
claiming
that
her
answers
would
be
adverse
to
the
interests
of
her
husband,
and
citing
both
the
marital
testimonial
privilege
and
the
marital
confidential
communications
privilege.
she
has
since
agreed
that
no
confidential
communications
would
be
involved
in
answering
the
questions.
a
hearing
was
held
on
whether
respondent
wanted
to
be
ordered
to
answer
the
questions.
at
that
hearing,
the
government
argued,
relying
on
cases
from
the
seventh
and
tenth
circuits,
that
the
marital
testimonial
privilege
does
not
apply
in
cases
involving
joint
participation
in
criminal
activities.
in
support
of
our
claim
of
joint
participation,
we
offered
an
affidavit
of
an
fbi
agent
who
had
interviewed
respondent's
husband.
that
affidavit
stated
that
mr.
koecher
said
that
he
and
respondent
had
met
with
czech
agents
on
a
number
of
occasions
between
1962
and
1983.
in
the
early
1960's,
they
were
directed
to
penetrate
u.s.
intelligence
agencies.
they
subsequently
moved
to
the
united
states.
mr.
koecher
got
a
job
with
the
cia,
and
he
passed
virtually
any
secret
material
he
obtained
while
employed
there.
mrs.
koecher
served
as
his
courier
delivering
documents
and
receiving
payments
for
the
delivery.
at
the
hearing,
respondent
did
not
contest
our
evidence
regarding
joint
participation.
instead,
relying
on
third
circuit
cases,
she
argued
the
marital
testimonial
privilege
applies
even
when
there
is
joint
participation
in
criminal
activity.
the
district
court
agreed
with
the
government,
ordered
respondent
to
answer
the
questions,
and
subsequently
ordered
her
held
in
civil
contempt
when
she
refused
to
answer.
she
spent
about
four
months
in
jail
but
refused
to
answer
the
questions.
in
december
of
1964,
a
one-count
indictment
was
returned
charging
mr.
koecher
with
espionage.
that
indictment
alleged
that
he
removed
a
certain
four-page
document
from
the
cia
in
1975
and
had
it
delivered
to
czech
agents.
at
the
second
circuit's
direction,
the
district
court
considered
whether
the
dominant
or
sole
purpose
of
the
grand
jury
in
continuing
to
seek
to
question
respondent
was
to
obtain
evidence
for
use
at
mr.
koecher's
trial.
the
district
court
concluded
that
that
was
not
the
grand
jury's
purpose.
rather,
it
concluded
that
the
indictment
would
appear
to
barely
scratch
the
surface,
and
that
it
would
be
reasonable
and
logical
for
the
grand
jury
to
continue
to
seek
answers
to
many
other
questions
such
as
who
worked
with
mr.
koecher
at
the
cia,
who
were
the
czech
agents
to
whom
mrs.
koecher
delivered
documents,
and
what
other
documents
and
information
other
than
the
four-page
document
mentioned
in
the
indictment
have
been
delivered
to
the
agents.
the
second
circuit
subsequently
declined
to
accept
our
argument
that
the
marital
testimony
of
privilege
does
not
apply
in
cases
involving
joint
participation,
and
reversed
the
district
court's
decision
ordering
respondent
to
answer.
the
issue
before
this
court,
therefore,
is
whether
when
spouses
jointly
participate
in
criminal
activity,
a
privilege
against
giving
adverse
testimony
should
be
recognized.
the
trammel
decision
sets
out
the
two
factors
to
be
considered
in
determining
whether
the
privilege
should
be
recognized
in
this
situation.
on
the
one
hand,
there
is
the
need
for
probative
evidence.
on
the
other
hand,
there
is
the
interest
in
marital
harmony.
the
trammel
decision
shows
that
those
interests
must
be
weighed
against
each
other
to
determine
whether
the
privilege
ought
to
be
recognized
in
certain
classes
of
cases.
in
cases
that
do
not
involve
joint
participation,
we
contend
that
the
trammel
decision
shows
that
those
interests
are
nearly
at
equilibrium.
nineteen
states
have
abolished
the
privilege
altogether,
concluding
that
the
need
for
evidence
outweighs
the
interest
in
marital
harmony
in
all
circumstances.
distinguished
commentators
such
as
wigmore
and
mccormack
have
also
called
for
abolition
of
the
privilege.
and
influential
model
rules
such
as
the
model
code
of
evidence
and
the
uniform
rules
of
evidence
have
also
abolished
the
privilege
while
leaving
the
marital
communications
privilege
intact.
the
need
for
evidence
is
a
weighty
need.
this
court
has
13
times
cited...
for
hardwick's
1812
statement
that
the
public
has
a
right
to
every
man's
evidence.
in
branzburg
v.
hayes,
the
court
concluded
that
the
public's
right
to
evidence
outweighed
the
first
amended
interest
of
newsmen
in
protecting
their
confidential
sources.
the
court
stated
that
the
public
interest
in
law
enforcement
and
in
ensuring
effective
grand
jury
proceedings
overrides
the
consequential
but
uncertain
burden
on
news
gathering
that
is
said
to
result
from
insisting
that
reporters
like
other
citizens
answer
questions
put
to
them
in
grand
jury
proceedings.
in
united
states
v.
nixon,
similarly,
the
need
for
evidence
was
held
to
outweigh
the
president's
interest
in
confidentiality
in
the
communications
in
his
own
office.
as
in
branzburg,
the
court
noted
that
the
need
for
production
of
relevant
evidence
in
a
criminal
proceeding
is
specific
and
central
to
fair
adjudication
of
a
particular
case
such
that
without
access
to
specific
facts,
a
criminal
prosecution
may
be
totally
frustrated,
while
the
need
for
confidentiality
is
general
and
uncertain.
the
court
added--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--we
contend,
as
i
believe
five
courts
of
appeals
have
agreed
with
us,
that
it
does
not
protect
communications
made
in
the
furtherance
of
criminal
activity,
but
other
than
that,
we
have
not
challenged
that,
but--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--we
would
make
that
argument.
that
has
not...
that
issue
has
not
been
raised
in
this
case.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
the
court
noted
in
u.s.
v.
nixon
that
privileges
are
not
lightly
created
nor
expansively
construed,
for
they
are
in
the
derogation
of
the
search
for
truth.
the
need
for
obtaining
probative
evidence
in
this
case
is
great.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
reply
brief,
it
is
the
policy
of
the
government
not
to
compel
family
members
to
testify
adversely
unless
the
testimony
is
needed.
in
this
case,
as
the
district
court
noted,
respondent
may
have
a
great
deal
of
information--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--no,
but
in
the
case
of
family
members
it
is
the
government's
policy
to
see
whether
the
evidence
can
be
obtained
from
other
sources.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
roughly,
yes,
that
is
right.
as
a
general
matter,
the
interest
in
obtaining
probative
evidence
is
greater
in
cases
involving
joint
participation.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that
is
true.
in
the
joint
participation
cases,
while
respondent
has
not
yet
raised
the
fifth
amendment,
we--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--we
would
have
to
if
she
is
a
joint
participant.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that's
right.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
it
is
our
position
that
we
have
to
come
in
with
some
independent
evidence--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--in
this
case,
for
instance,
we
have
mr.
koecher's
own
statements
to
fbi
agents
that
mrs.
koecher
was
a
part
of
the
conspiracy,
that
she
served
as
his
courier,
that
she
met
with
czech
agents
in
czechoslovakia,
in
new
york,
and
in
vienna
on
a
number
of
occasions
over
a
20-year
period.
in
this
case,
we
don't
believe
that
there
is
any
serious
doubt
about
our
showing
of
joint
participation.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
we
have
not--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--we
have
not
shown
joint
participation--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
we
would
certainly
concede
that.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
we
think
we
have
to
do
more
than
charge
as
a
co-conspirator.
the
district
court
would
have
to
agree
with
us
that
we
had
come
forward
with
independent
evidence
showing
that
there
was
a
probable
cause
to
believe
that
she
was
a
joint
participant.
in
analogous
circumstances
involving
the
marital
communications
privilege
or
the
lawyer-client
privilege,
which
also
do
not
protect
communications
made
in
furtherance
of
joint
criminal
activities,
courts
have
faced
similar
problems,
and
they
have
not
been
insurmountable
by
any
means.
it
is
worth
pointing
out
that
the
need
for
probative
evidence
is
greater
in
cases
involving
joint
participation,
and
that
in
connection
with
that
the
privilege,
if
recognized,
will
as
a
practical
matter
often
shield
third
parties
as
well
as
spouses.
the
marital
privileges
have
frequently
been
asserted,
as
the
cases
we
site
show,
in
drug
cases,
for
example,
which
have
often
involved
large
teams
of
conspirators.
thus,
as
a
practical
matter,
if
the
government
cannot
compel
testimony
in
any
circumstances,
a
number
of
third
parties
are
likely
to
benefit
as
well,
as
this
case
shows.
we
don't
know
who
those
third
parties
are,
but
specifically,
that
is,
although
presumably
there
are
czech
agents
who
are
shielded,
we
cannot
get
this
testimony.
on
the
other
side
of
the
balance
from
the
need
for
probative
evidence
is
the
interest
in
preserving
marital
harmony.
as
an
initial
matter,
it
is
worth
noting
that
this
interest,
like
the
interest
asserted
in
branzburg
and
in
u.s.
v.
nixon,
are
uncertain.
it
may
have
no
effect
at
all,
abolition
of
the
testimonial
privilege,
at
least
in
some
cases.
contrary
to
respondent's
repeated
suggestions,
there
is
simply
nothing
about
compelled
testimony
that
automatically
leads
to
dissolution
of
marriage.
indeed,
respondent's
argument
is
somewhat
contradictory.
on
one
hand,
she
has
repeatedly
stated
that
she
is
so
devoted
to
her
husband
and
he
to
him
that
she
will
never
testify
against
him.
at
the
same
time,
however,
she
implies
that
their
marriage
will
disintegrate
automatically
if
she
answers
our
questions.
he
suspect
that
she
exaggerates
on
both
counts.
moreover,
as
this
court
suggested
in
hawkins,
we
think
that
there
is
less
danger
of
an
adverse
effect
on
marital
harmony
when
testimony
is
compelled
than
there
is
when
the
testimony
is
voluntarily
given
by
a
spouse
in
return,
for
example,
for
a
promise
of
leniency.
the
court
of
appeals
here
did
not
appear
to
understand
that
there
is
a
utilitarian
aspect
as
well
as
a
non-utilitarian
aspect
to
the
interest
in
marital
harmony.
it
concluded
that
a
marriage
between
criminals
can
be
devoted
and
essentially
ended
its
inquiry
at
that.
it
thus
overlooked
the
public
interest
in
marital
harmony
even
though
this
court
stressed
that
public
interest
in
trammel,
and
even
though
commentators
have
always
assumed
that
privileges
exist
to
serve
utilitarian
purposes.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
our
position
is
that
we
have
to
come
forward
and
make
a
prima
facie
showing
of
joint
participation.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i
presume
until
we
make
that
showing
they
certainly
are.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
as
i
have
read
the
cases,
the
probable
cause
prima
facie
showing
required
in
the
lawyer-client
privilege
cases,
for
example,
have--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--certainly.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
wouldn't
you
be
satisfied
with
just
showing
enough
to
be
accused,
not
convicted?
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
it
was
a
post-trammel
decision,
so
the
witness
must
have
asserted
the
privilege.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
no,
we
are
asking
for
an
exception.
we
believe
that
it
is
important
to
understand
that
the
interests
are
nearer
to
equilibrium
without
the
addition
of
joint
participation
in
crimes.
and
we
think
we
have
shown
that.
from
that
point,
it
seems
to
us
that
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
added
weight
on
the
side
of
the
need
for
probative
evidence
added
because
a
joint
participant
spouse
is
likely
to
have
more
evidence
as
well
as
the
lesser
interest
on
the
other
side
of
the
balance.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
certainly
19
states
have
concluded
that
that
is
logical,
and
most
of
the
commentators,
the
distinguished
commentators
who
thought
about
this
and
authors
of
the
model
rules
have
all
reached
those
conclusions--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--no,
they
have
primarily
said
that
the
marital
testimonial
privilege
ought
to
be
abolished
altogether
and
only
confidential
communications
privilege
retained.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
i
am
sure
that
my
colleague
will
tell
you
about
the
undistinguished
commentators--
0
[generallaughter.]
--many
of
whom
have
suggested
radically
broadening
the
privilege
to
include
friends
and
lovers
and
various
other
people.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
we
have
not
asked
for
it.
i
do
not
understand
that
we
would
object
to
it,
no.
returning
to
the--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--exactly.
exactly.
we
believe
that
that
addition
clearly
shows
that
the
privilege
ought
not
be
recognized
in
these
circumstances
because,
in
part,
we
see
little
social
utilitarian
interest
in
a
case
involving
joint
participation
in
a
crime.
there
is
another
reason
why
the
interest
in
preserving
marital
harmony
is
diminished
in
cases
involving
drug
participation
that
i
haven't
mentioned.
it
is
that
recognition
of
the
privilege
in
this
case
actually
encourages
the
recruitment
of
spouses
as
co-conspirators.
it
is
true
that
after
this
court's
trammel
decision,
a
spouse
cannot
be
sure
that
his
co-conspirator
spouse
won't
decide
to
testify
against
him.
but
there
is
still
a
significant
advantage
in
recruiting
a
spouse
as
a
co-conspirator
if
the
privilege
is
recognized,
as
this
case
illustrates.
thus,
viewed
prospectively,
it
is
the
privilege
that
is
likely
to
harm
the
institution
of
marriage
by
encouraging
criminals
to
recruit
their
spouses
as
co-conspirators
if
the
exceptions
we
propose
is
not
recognized.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i
am
sorry?
i
meant
to
say
recruit
spouses
as
co-conspirators,
if
that
is
not
what
i
said.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
again,
summarization
our
argument,
the
position
we
have
made
is
that
the
interests
to
be
weighed
are
very
close
without
our
exception,
and
we
thin
that
there
is
added
weight
on
the
side
of
the
need
for
probative
evidence
because
co-conspirator
spouses
are
likely
to
have
more
evidence.
we
think
there
is
less
weight
on
the
site
of
protecting
marital
harmony
because
it
is
not
clear
that
compelled
testimony
will
have
an
effect,
because
there
is
little
or
no
societal
interest
in
preserving
marriages
between
criminals,
and
because
recognizing
privilege
in
these
circumstances
encourages
a
recruitment
of
spouses
as
co-conspirators.
i
would
like
to
briefly
discuss
two
arguments
respondent
makes
that
do
not
add
to
our
argument.
one
argument
that
respondent
repeatedly
makes
is
an
argument
that
decent
people
have
a
natural
repugnance
to
watching
one
spouse
testify
against
another.
as
an
initial
matter,
it
is
worth
noting
that
wigmore,
who
coined
the
phrase
"natural
repugnance",
dismissed
this
argument
summarily,
and
that
this
court
in
comprehensively
reviewing
the
privilege
in
trammel
did
not
mention
it.
nevertheless,
we
do
not
think
that
there
is
nothing
to
this
argument.
instead,
we
think
it
is
merely
a
restatement
of
the
personal
interest,
the
non-utilitarian
interest
in
marital
harmony
that
weighs
on
the
other
side
of
the
balance,
the
side
favoring
that
condition.
but
we
think
it
is
nothing
more
than
that,
and
we
do
not
think
it
is
a
particularly
weighty
factor.
some
people,
at
least,
have
a
natural
repugnance
to
evidentiary
rules
that
allow
guilty
defendants
to
go
free
because
of
the
introduction
of
evidence
against
them
that
proves
their
guilt
has
been
prohibited.
and
in
cases
of
joint
participation
in
criminal
activity,
any
sympathy
we
might
otherwise
feel
for
the
spouse,
the
witness
spouse
who
faces
a
difficult
decision
between
testifying,
between
perjuring
herself,
and
between
being
held
in
contempt,
is
lessened
considerably
by
the
fact
that
she
has
brought
this
upon
herself
by
agreeing
to
participate
in
the
crime.
the
other
argument
is
respondent's
repeated
suggestion
that
the
marital
privilege
somehow
has
a
constitutional
basis.
there
is
simply
nothing
in
the
constitution
nor
in
this
court's
decisions
that
suggests
that
the
privilege
is
constitutionally
based
and,
of
course,
constitutionalizing
the
privilege
would
interferes
with
the
common
law
process
that
many
states
have
used
to
abolish
the
privilege
altogether.
furthermore,
to
the
extent
that
respondent
appears
to
believe
that
the
constitutional
basis
for
this
privilege
is
the
right
to
privacy,
we
think
she
has
her
marital
privileges
confused.
if
either
of
the
privileges
involves
the
right
to
privacy,
it
is
the
confidential
communications
privilege,
not
the
testimonial
privilege.
that
no
privacy
interest
is
implicated
in
these
cases...
in
these
case,
rather,
can
be
determined
clearly
by
reading
the
three
questions
that
respondent
has
refused
to
answer.
it
is
also
worth
noting
that
an
exception
like
the
joint
participant
exception
that
we
favor
has
been
recognized
for
all
other
privileges,
as
i
mentioned
previously.
the
reason
for
that,
we
submit,
is
that
the
social
utility
in
recognizing
a
privilege
is
severely
lessened
when
the
privilege
is
used
to
shield
joint
criminal
activity.
in
summary,
in
this
case,
we
are
asking
the
court
to
hold
that
the
marital
testimonial
privilege,
like
other
privileges,
does
not
shield
joint
criminal
activity.
we
think
that
the
court's
decision
in
trammel
shows
that
the
factors
to
be
weighed
are
nearly
at
equilibrium
in
the
absence
of
joint
criminal
activity.
when
we,
when
the
the
government
comes
forward
with
independent
evidence
showing
that
there
was
joint
participation
in
crime,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
need
for
probative
evidence
is
greater,
the
societal
interest
in
preserving
marital
harmony
is
lessened,
so
that
the
balance
clearly
tips
against
recognition
of
the
privilege
in
these
circumstances.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
the
trammel
case
does
not
expressly
apply.
that
case
involved
voluntary
testimony.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
no.
i
might
mention
in
that
regard
that--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--that
in
the
trammel
case,
the
tenth
circuit
based
its
decision
on
the
joint
participant
exception.
we
argued
in
our
brief
in
trammel
that
the
court
should
affirm
on
the
basis
that
the
court
did
affirm
on
the
voluntary
testimony
exception,
which
is
a
broader
argument,
one
that
applies
in
more
cases.
the
court
did
not
mention
the
joint
participant
exception.
we
don't
think
that
any
inference,
certainly
no
negative
inference
can
be
drawn
from
the
fact
that
the
court
actually
went
farther
than
it
probably
needed
to
in
some
areas
and
to
some
extent
in
that
case.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes,
i
do.
i
would
like
to
add
that
we
believe
that
joint
participation
in
crime
is
corruption
of
the
marriage,
and
in
that
respect
it
is
analogous
to
other
relationship
where
crime
and
fraud
and
joint
participant
exceptions
are
also
recognized.
it
is
a
corruption
of
the
attorney-client
relationship,
the
reason
society
recognized
a
privilege
there
for
the
client
to
go
in
seeking
advice
to
help
in
a
criminal
matter.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
of
course,
we
don't
believe
that
that
is
presented
here
because
we
believe
that
she
joined
the
conspiracy
in
1963
or
1962,
whenever
she
first
attended
meetings
with
the
czechoslovak
agents.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
i
don't
think
we
do...
i
think
that
probably
we
could.
that
is
not
presented
here,
i
don't
think.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
we
have
thought
it
through
to
the
extent
that
we
certainly
believe
it
relates
to
everything
of
the
matter
that
is
under
investigation.
for
example,
in
espionage
in
this
case,
we
are
not
contending
that
if
they
were--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--we
think
not.
we
think
that
once
we
have
shown
joint
participation,
that
ought
to
be
enough.
respondent
had
brought
up
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
it
was
pointed
out
that,
of
course,
parent-child
relationships,
there
has
never
been
such
a
privilege.
we
think
that
to
the
extent
respondent
attempts
to
rely
on
fifth
amendment
privilege,
it
merely
shows
the
medieval
roots
of
this
privilege,
the
fact
that
it
is
here
in
this
form
results
from
the
outdated
view
that
the
husband
and
wife
are
one.
respondent
also
mentioned
that
the
only
evidence
we
offered
to
show
joint
participation
here
were
the
affidavits
from
the
fbi
agents
based
on
mr.
koecher's
evidence.
as
i
have
stated,
we
believe
that
that
is
quite
compelling
evidence.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
we
were
never
put
to
our
proof
that
we
had
other
evidence
at
the
november
29th,
1984,
hearing.
respondent
simply
did
not
argue
that
there
wasn't
proof
of
joint
participation.
finally,
respondent
began
and
ended
his
presentation
by
noting
that
this
is
an
old
privilege
and
by
quoting
the
trammel
decision
where
the
court
said
that
it
is
reluctant
to
change
things
or
takes
a
gradual
view
of
these
matters.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
court
in
trammel
also
pointed
out
that
when
all
that
can
be
said
for
a
privilege
is
that
it
is
an
old
privilege,
that
precedent
alone
is
not
enough.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
