well,
is
it
the
government's
policy
to
ask
non-family
members
to
testify
even
though
their
testimony
isn't
needed?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
have
got
to
bend
over
backwards
to
avoid
calling
them
if
you
can
avoid
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
have
the
undistinguished
commentators
taken
any
position?

justice
william

rehnquist
mr.
lynch,
i
wonder
if
your
use
of
the
word
"betray"
a
couple
of
minutes
ago
isn't
a
rather
inappropriate
term.
if
the
law
does
say
that
the
spouse
can
be
compelled
to
testify,
i
can
see
how
a
husband
could
be,
you
know,
deeply
disturbed
or
a
wife
deeply
disturbed,
the
spouse
is
testifying
against
them,
perhaps
disagrees
with
the
spouse's
account,
which
could
be
a
source
of...
but
to
say
that
the
spouse
is
betrayed,
i
just
don't
think
that
is
a
very
apt
use
of
that
word.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
fifth
amendment
analogy
is
my
loyalty
to
another
person,
i
myself?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
are
analogies
in
the
way
the
attorney-client
privilege
is
treated
to
what
the
government
is
asking
for
here.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
how
serious
a
conflict
is
that?
as
long
as
we
are
speculating,
how
many
wives
are
going
to
go
to
jail
rather
than
testify
against
their
husbands,
go
to
jail
for
an
indefinite
period
of
time,
or
at
least
the
life
of
the
grand
jury?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
there
any
reason
to
believe
that
she
is
a
typical
example?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
long
did
the
spouse
spend
in
jail
in
the
clark
case?
