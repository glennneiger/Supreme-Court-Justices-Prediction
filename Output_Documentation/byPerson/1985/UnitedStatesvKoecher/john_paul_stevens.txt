justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wright,
may
i
interrupt?
i
wasn't
sure
i
caught
something.
you
mentioned
the
marital
communications
privilege
has
not
been
challenged
in
a
number
of
states
which
have
abolished
the
basic
privilege.
what
is
the
government's
position
on
the
marital
communications
privilege?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
this
particular
case,
if
you
prevail,
you
would
think
you
could
ask
about
communications
between
the
husband
and
wife
in
this
particular
inquiry.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
it
is
true,
isn't
it,
mr.
wright,
that
the
only
time
you
really
reach
this
issue
is
if
you
granted
immunity,
because
i
suppose
the
spouse
could
always
plead
the
fifth
amendment
by
hypothesis
in
the
category
of
cases
we
are
dealing
with.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
you
granted
immunity,
didn't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
we
are
really
not...
we
are
mostly
talking
about
the
testimony
for
purposes
of
investigation
before
a
grand
jury,
i
would
suppose
is
the
most
important
area
that
you...
well,
no,
you...
off
then
with
trial
testimony,
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wright,
perhaps
this
is
a
similar
thought
to
the
one
justice
marshall
expressed,
but
at
the
time
the
trial
is
taking
place,
when
you
seek
to
get
the
testimony,
do
you
assume
that
they
are
criminals
or
that
they
are
innocent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
they
still
entitled
to
the
presumption
of
innocence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
is
a
probable
cause
showing
under
your
standard
as
i
understand
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
make
a
probable
cause
showing
before
the
grand
jury,
but
the
presumption
of
innocence
survives
that
showing
normally.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
here
you
are
suggesting
it
doesn't,
i
guess.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
mr.
wright,
it
sounds
like
most
of
your
arguments
really
go
to
a
suggestion
that
the
privilege
be
altogether
eliminated,
not
just
an
exception
created.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
lynch,
isn't
it
your
point
that
if
you
prevail
he
won't
have
this
power?
justice
john
paul
stevens
his
position
couldn't
have
been
adopted
without
a
statute,
because
you
have
to
have
an
immunity
statute
or
you
have
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
why
i
don't
suppose
you
have
any
experience
in
the
19
states,
because
they
all
have
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
justice
john
paul
stevens
say
you
wanted
to
ask
her
about
what
happened
in
1960.
could
you
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
just
wondering
what
the
scope
of
the
exception
you
are
asking
for
is,
whether
it
is
just,
once
the
privilege
is
waived,
it
is
waived
as
to
everything,
or
only
for
the
period
of
joint
participation?
maybe
you
haven't
thought
it
through.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
the
husband
were
engaged
in
espionage
at
a
time
and
all
she
knew
was
when
he
was
home
and
when
he
was
traveling
or
something,
and
you
wanted
to
ask
her
about
his
whereabouts?
could
she
claim
the
privilege
during
the
period
prior
to
her
actually
helping
him
out?
