well,
it
occurs
to
me
it
might
make
more
sense
just
to
abandon
it
altogether
than
to
try
to
save
something
out
of
it.

but
the
distinguished
commentators
on
which
you
rely
are
not
speaking
out
in
favor
of
the
creation
of
just
an
exception
from
the
rule,
are
they?

mr.
lynch,
how
many
states
have
abolished
the
privilege
altogether?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
is
why
it
might
take
more
sense
to
abolish
it
altogether
than
to
create
an
exception.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
lynch,
presumably
we
have
a
substantial
body
of
experience
in
the
19
states
which
have
eliminated
the
privilege
altogether.
what
does
that
experience
show?
