mr.
brian
e.
thiede
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
feel
compelled
to,
at
the
beginning
at
least,
reference
why
it
is
that
we
are
here,
the
underlying
circumstances,
and
that
is
that
mr.
rudy
bladel,
in
the
city
of
jackson,
the
state
of
michigan,
killed
three
people
who
happened
to
work
for
the
railroad
because
he
didn't
like
the
railroad,
not
because
he
had
any
complaint
with
them,
but
they
just
happened
to
be
railroad
employees.
mr.
jackson
in
the
city
or
county
of
wayne
killed
a
mr.
perry
because
mr.
perry's
wife
didn't
like
him
any
more
but
wanted
to
collect
the
insurance
money
we
have
some
very
serious
cases
here,
serious
on
the
facts
and
serious
to
the
people
of
the
state
of
michigan
because
of
that.
despite
the
fact
that
the
motivations
of
the
killings
in
these
cases
are
different,
they
do
present
a
common
legal
proposition.
that
proposition
was
ruled
on
by
the
michigan
supreme
court
where
they
created
what
they
thought
to
be
an
analogous
rule
to
edwards
versus
arizona.
simply
stated,
the
michigan
supreme
court
held
that
if
a
defendant,
while
at
his
initial
appearance
before
a
magistrate
who
has
no
jurisdiction
to
accept
a
final
plea
in
the
case,
whose
only
job
is
ministerial,
in
other
words
to
advise
a
defendant
of
the
charge
against
him,
set
bond
if
bond
is
appropriate,
and
to
advise
him
of
his
right
to
counsel
and
to
get
the
administrative
process
going
if
he's
indigent,
the
michigan
supreme
court
said
if
the
defendant
asked
for
appointed
counsel
at
that
stage,
the
police
are
forevermore
precluded
from
initiating
interrogation
of
that
defendant.
reading
the
cases
of
this
court,
it
seems
that
there
are
two
bases
upon
which
this
court
has
excluded
confessions.
one
is,
when
there
is
some
impingement
on
a
constitutional
right
such
as
the
fifth
amendment
setting
or
henry
and
brewer
and
cases
like
that
where
it's
the
sixth
amendment,
or
in
the
alternative,
where
the
confession
itself
is
unreliable.
i
don't
think
either
of
those
factors
exist
in
this
case.
there
is
simply
no
reason
for
the
rule
established
by
the
michigan
supreme
court.
as
justice
white
noted
in,
i
believe
selum
versus
stooms,
the
follow-up
case
on
edwards,
in
discussing
its
retroactivity,
the
edwards
rule
has
very
little
to
do
with
the
reliability
of
a
confession.
it
hasn't
a
real
great
deal
to
do
with
the
truth
telling
process,
because
there
remains
at
all
times,
apart
from
any
per
se
rule,
the
ability
of
the
defense
to
challenge
the
voluntariness,
and
that
of
the
confession.
so,
the
per
se
rule
does
not
change
that.
it
does
not
preclude
the
defendant
from
having
an
opportunity
to
challenge
the
reliability
of
the
statement
itself.
edwards,
however,
did
have
the
salutory
effect
of
giving
the
defendant
some
security
in
that
while
asking
for
counsel
during
police
interrogation,
the
police
could
no
longer
return
and
re-initiate
interrogation.
that
seems
to
be
a
logical
result.
there
seems
to
be
a
logical
flow
between
a
request
for
counsel
during
interrogation
and
the
secession
of
interrogation,
and
a
per
se
rule
that
the
police
cannot
re-initiate
interrogation
until
counsel
has
been
provided.
i
see
no
logical
connection
between
the
request
for
counsel
such
as
we
had
in
these
cases
where
the
judge
advises
a
defendant,
you
have
a
right
to
have
counsel
represent
you
at
a
preliminary
examination,
and
other
judicial
proceedings
thereafter.
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
i
think
the
michigan
supreme
court's
rule
would
apply.
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
no,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
exactly.
i
think
that's
necessary.
i
think
it's
necessary
because
under
the
michigan
supreme
court
rule,
we
get
into
all
kinds
of
problems
that
they
have
obviously
not
anticipated
with
a
non-indigent
defendant.
oftentimes
we
find
it
necessary
to
kind
of
bolster
the
position
of
the
indigent
defendant
so
he's
on
equal
footing
with
a
non-indigent.
but
i
think
in
this
case,
the
result
is
to
do
the
opposite.
it
is
to
actually
put
the
non-indigent
defendant
in
a
lower
position,
because
what
the
michigan
supreme
court
doesn't
even
take
into
consideration--
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
--i
would
say,
perhaps
after
the
preliminary
hearing,
would
have
a
different
setting.
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
no,
this
is
an
initial
appearance.
that's
one
thing
that
i
hope
the
court
understands.
all
that
we
have
had
happen
is,
a
warrant
is
issued
and
an
arrest--
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
--well,
i
don't
know.
again--
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
--there
is
an
outstanding
charge,
we
have
a
warrant.
that
is
what
we
have.
we
have
a
man
arrested.
he
is
in
custody.
and
then,
this
is
under
our
speedy
arraignment,
like
federal
rule
5-a.
we
have
to
hustle
him
into
court
and
advise
him
of
his
right
to
counsel,
set
bond
and
tell
him
about
the
prelim
and
things
like
that,
and
tell
him
about
the
charge.
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
yes,
i
think
so,
and
i
think
there's
some
important
reasons
for
that.
first
of
all,
as
a
practical
matter,
at
least
in
our
courts,
the
police
are
rarely
present
for
arraignment,
for
this
type
of
an
arraignment,
for
an
initial
appearance,
i
guess
we
should
use
the
terminology.
the
prosecutor
is
not
there
for
initial
appearance.
we
have
people
brought
through
a
tunnel.
a
court
officer
picks
them
up.
they
take
them
down
and
the
judge
goes
through
this
procedure.
there
is
typically
nobody
from
our
side,
if
you
will,
there
to
see
what's
going
on.
the
michigan
supreme
court
said,
well,
that's
no
problem
because
they
can
go
check
the
court
file
and
see
what
has
happened.
well,
i
submit
that
there
are
a
million
and
one
problems
with
the
michigan
supreme
court's
thinking
on
that.
first
of
all,
what
the
defendant
does
there,
and
this
would
really
preclude
your
first
example,
is
the
district
court
judge
cannot
appoint
an
attorney.
he
has
no
authority
to,
this
judge
that
he
is
standing
before.
all
he
can
do
is
say,
here,
mr.
defendant,
here's
a
form.
fill
it
out.
it's
a
financial
form,
says
how
much
money
he
makes,
how
much
he
spends
out,
to
see
if
he's
indigent.
all
he
can
do
is
swear
to
the
truth
of
that
form,
and
then
he
sends
that
form
to
the
circuit
court
administrator's
office,
and
that's
where
it
goes.
if
these
diligent
police
officers
run
over
and
pull
open
the
court
file,
there's
going
to
be
nothing
in
there
that
tells
them
that
the
man
has
requested
counsel
in
this
setting.
they
just
aren't
going
to
know,
and
then
they're
going
to
walk
next
door--
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
--no,
i
don't
think
so,
and
one
problem
becomes,
we
don't
always
know
if
they're
going
to
get
court
appointed
counsel.
sometimes
they
are
rejected
because
they
are
not
indigent.
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
at
the
preliminary
hearing
he
can
have
a
lawyer.
he
can
have
his
own
lawyer--
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
--hmm?
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
well,
he
can.
it's
just--
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
--i
suppose
he
could,
but
as
far
as
the
system
works,
the
district
court
judge,
that's
not
his
decision
as
to
whether
somebody
is
in
fact
indigent
or
not.
he
just
doesn't
have
the
authority
to
make
that
decision.
you
see,
that's
why
i
think,
justice
white,
with
your
comment
about,
haven't
the
proceedings
begun,
i
think
we
are
so
short
into
what's
going
on
when
we're
talking
about
the
juncture
here--
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
--hm-hmm.
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
well--
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
--if
i--
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
--no.
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
no,
the
magistrate
cannot.
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
what
happens,
we
have
a
different
system
when
there's
a
requirement
of
counsel
for
interrogation
purposes,
for
lineup
purposes
and
the
like.
there's
a
list
of
attorneys
who
the
defendant
can
choose
from
to
call
and
the
county
will
pay
the
expense
of
an
attorney
for
that
purpose.
so,
if
someone
is
arrested
and
they
get
the
miranda
rights--
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
--there
is.
on
preliminary
hearings
we
have
a
contract
with
certain
defense
firms,
and
they
are
selected
at
random,
yes.
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
well,
i
think
you
are
confusing
two
of
the...
the
system,
and
how
it
works.
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
i
think
you
are,
sir,
with
all
due
respect.
initially
there
is
the
warrant
issued.
the
warrant
was
issued
in
this
case.
the
man
was
arrested
pursuant
to
that.
then
he
goes
for
the
speedy
arraignment
before
a
district
court
judge,
or
a
magistrate
who
has
no
jurisdiction
to
accept
a
plea.
the
only
thing
he
has
jurisdiction,
to
tell
his
at
this
point
what
the
charge
is,
to
set
bond,
and
to
tell
him
that
he
has
a
right
to
counsel,
and
if
he
is
indigent,
that
he
has
a
right
to
fill
out
this
form
and
that,
and
that's
what
happened
here.
then,
within
12
days
under
michigan
law,
there
is
required
to
be
a
preliminary
examination
and
we--
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
--yeah,
i
think
so.
because
what
we
are--
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
--no,
i
think
in
this
case--
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
--no,
i
think--
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
--i
think
we're
not
communicating
too
well,
sir.
what
happens,
you
mentioned,
if
he
asks
for
an
attorney
when
he's
given
his
miranda
rights
on
arrest
by
the
police
officers,
then
we
hustle
an
attorney
down
right
away,
or
we
simply
don't
question
him
and
we
will
not
return,
because
we
can't
return
under
edwards.
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
right.
if
he
asks--
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
--that's
exactly
right.
if
he
asks
during
custodial
interrogation,
like
the
edwards
type
case,
if
during
custodial
interrogation
the
guy
asks
for
an
attorney
when
given
his
miranda
rights
or
any
time
thereafter
during
custodial
interrogation,
he
will
not
be
questioned
again
unless
he
initiates
the
contact
and
we
again
advise
him
of
his
rights
and
he
waives
them.
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
that
is
the
time
under
statute
that
we
have
to
bring
a
person
for
a
preliminary
examination
to
see
if
there
is
probable
cause
to
hold
him
for
trial.
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
if
he
has
requested
counsel
at
any
time
during
miranda...
during
custodial
interrogation,
he
will
not
be
questioned
by
police.
that's
what
happens.
so,
what
we're
saying
here,
the
difference
between
our
rule,
what
we
think
the
law
is,
and
the
michigan
supreme
court,
is
that
gives
us
the
opportunity
once
he's
asked
for
counsel
in
the...
during
the
judicial
process,
if
that's
what
you
want
to
call
it,
give
us
the
opportunity
to
go
and
advise
him
of
his
miranda
rights,
make
sure
that
when
he
says,
"i
want
an
attorney
to
represent
me
in
the
judicial
proceedings.
"
that
means
also,
"i
want
an
attorney
to
represent
me
during
custodial
interrogation.
"
and
if
he
says
that,
we
don't
question
him.
that's
the
only
burden
on
the
defendant
in
this
case,
is
to
have
to
sift
through
miranda
rights
after
this
arraignment
and
be
able
to
say,
"i
want
an
attorney".
and
they
say,
"okay,
fine",
and
the
walk
away,
because
that's
what
they
have
to
do.
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
sometimes.
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
when
there
is
a
grand
jury
indictment,
there
is
also
a
right
to
a
preliminary
examination
by
either
party.
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
yes,
it
is
theoretically
possible.
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
i
would
think--
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
--i
think
it
would
have
to
be,
for
some
practical
reasons.
it
need
not
be
for
us
to
prevail
in
this
case.
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
i
think
our
position
would
still
have
to
be
that
it
is
appropriate
only
to
preclude
further
interrogation
when
the
defendant
asks
for
counsel
in
a
context
which
shows
that
he
wants
counsel
during
interrogation,
not
simply
during
the
judicial
process.
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
no,
it's
not.
but
in
contrast
to
many
of
the
federal
courts,
i
know
of
no
circumstances
in
michigan
where
miranda
rights
are
given
during
this
arraignment,
and
that's
what
distinguishes
many
of
the
federal
cases
as
well.
many
of
the
federal
cases,
the
magistrate
not
only
advises
him
of
his
right
to
counsel
during
the
judicial
process,
but
also
reads
the
miranda
rights
to
him.
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
sure,
no
question
about
that,
no
question
about
that.
and,
that's
why
we're
not
saying
that
the
police
can
now
come
in
and
get
a
confession
out
of
the
man.
all
we're
saying
is,
the
police
can
go
in
and
advise
him
of
his
miranda
rights,
and
then
he
has
an
opportunity
to
clarify
that.
the
whole
purpose,
as
i
see
it--
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
--well,
they
can
get
a
confession
if
he
waives
counsel
for
that
purpose,
but
we'll
have
to
get
a
subsequent
specific
waiver
of
the
right
to
counsel
during
interrogation
before
we
can
get
a
confession
from
him.
so,
we
really
aren't
playing
games.
the
defense
has
continuously
tried
to
put
on
us
that
we
are
playing
games
between
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments.
i'm
not.
what
i'm
trying
to
do
is
provide
a
basis
where
the
subjective
intention
of
the
defendant
can
be
made
objective
by
the
advice
of
specific
rights
that
talk
about,
when
do
you
want
an
attorney.
the
judge
at
this
initial
appearance,
says,
"do
you
want
an
attorney
during
judicial
proceedings?
"
the
defendant
says,
"yes".
as
we
noted
in
nash
versus
estelle,
as
in
our
case
of
bladel--
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
--okay.
at
arraignment
in
district
court,
there
is...
it
is
set
up
by
statute
as
well
as
by
rule,
and
the
judge
says,
you
have
a
right
to
an
attorney
at
the
preliminary...
well,
first
he
says,
you
have
a
right
to
a
preliminary
examination
within
12
days,
you
have
a
right
to
representation
by
counsel
at
the
preliminary
examination
and
throughout
the
judicial
proceedings,
and
that's
the
language,
throughout
the
judicial
proceedings.
there
is
no
intimation
in
what
he
states
that,
you
have
a
right
to
counsel
during
police
interrogation
or
anything
like
that.
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
yes,
sir.
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
well,
i
think
where
it's
especially
ambiguous,
i
think
the
police
ought
to
have
the
opportunity
to
clarify.
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
that's
a
more
difficult
question,
but
i
think
that
would
depend
on
a
factor...
a
case
by
case
basis,
as
this
court
has
dealt
with,
i
think
it's
smith
versus
illinois,
the
ambiguity
or
potential
ambiguity
of
the
request
for
counsel.
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
yes,
because
otherwise
there's
just
going
to
be
a
whole
host
of
problems,
and
especially,
the
biggest
problem
is
you
may
preclude
the
police
from
the
opportunity
to
seek
a
confession
from
a
defendant
who
wants
to
confess.
that's
the
biggest
point.
all
i
want
is
the
opportunity
for
the
police
to
get
a
clarification
from
the
defendant
of
whether
he
wants
to
talk
without
an
attorney,
and
if
he
wants--
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
--yes.
what
we
have
in
this
case,
let
me
reference
the
facts
in--
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
--yes.
in
each
of
these
cases
there
was
some
time.
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
yes,
and
typically--
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
--right.
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
right,
yeah,
and
the
typical
defendant
who
doesn't
want
to
give
a
confession
is
already
going
to
have
asserted
his
miranda
rights
before
we
ever
get
to
this
stage,
and
so
the
police
have
already
been
precluded
by
edwards
from
re-initiating
interrogation.
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
no.
what
i
said
was,
if
he
ever,
during
miranda
warnings--
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
--no,
not
under
miranda.
not
under
miranda.
if
during
the
advice
of
miranda
rights,
he
ever
tells
the
police,
"i
want
an
attorney"--
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
--you
can
advise
him
a
million
times,
if
every
time
he
waives.
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
yes,
if
he
waives
every
time.
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
pardon?
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
no.
you
see,
what
i'm
talking
about--
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
--if
he
asks
for
a
lawyer.
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
your
honor,
i
think,
again
we're
not
communicating
because
there
are
two
separate
things.
if
he...
if
during
the
advice
of
miranda
rights
he
says,
"i
want
an
attorney",
then
we
will
never
advise
him
of
his
miranda
rights
again.
we
will
never
talk
to
him
unless
he
initiates
the
interrogation.
if
during
miranda
rights
he
says,
"i
don't
want
an
attorney",
then
we
can
interview
him
as
often
as
we
want
and
we
will,
as
with
both
of
these
defendants,
one
of
them
was
given
miranda
rights
seven
or
eight
times
and
each
time
said,
"i
don't
want
an
attorney",
and
confessed,
made
a
statement.
that's
when
i
am
saying,
they
can
return.
but
once
at
any
point
the
defendant
says
to
the
police,
"i
want
an
attorney",
edwards
versus
arizona
says
he
can't
come
back.
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
pardon?
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
not
during
interrogation,
not
during
an
interrogation.
jackson
was
interrogated
seven
times
and
he
never...
every
time
he
was
advised
of
his
miranda
rights,
every
time
he
waived
them.
bladel
was
interrogated
four
different
times.
each
time
he
was
advised
of
miranda
rights.
each
time
he
waived.
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
in
each
of
these
circumstances,
the
reason--
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
--well,
what
happened
in
bladel
is,
he
was
first
picked
up
just
for
questioning
in
january
and...
on
two
occasions
for
just
general
discussion,
given
miranda
rights,
and
he
waived
them
and
didn't
give
any
statements
of
substance.
later
on
we
got
a
warrant
for
him,
as
we
got
some
ballistics
evidence
that
gave
us
probable
cause,
so
we
brought
him
in
on
the
arrest.
he
was
again
advised
of
his
rights,
and
then
gave
a
statement
that
was
a
little
more
inculpatory.
then,
after
the
initial
appearance,
we
got
some
more
information
back,
more
evidence,
went
and
talked
with
bladel
about
it.
he
says
at
the
point,
"you
got
me",
and
confessed.
but
in
that
case
he
said...
when
he
got
to
the
point
of...
and
advice
of
miranda,
he
mentioned
that
he
had
asked
for
counsel
at
arraignment
but
specifically
said,
"i
don't
need
him
here.
"
"i
will
talk.
"
"i'm
going
to
plead
guilty
anyway.
"
and,
that's
the
situation
we
face.
we're
not
in
here
asking
for
a
rule
that
allows
police
to
badger
the
defendant
into
relinquishing
a
right.
all
we're
here
is
asking
for
a
rule
that
lets
the
police
ask
the
question
of
the
defendant,
whether
he
wants
an
attorney
during
interrogation.
if
he
does,
the
police
will
leave
him,
forever
leave
him
alone.
if
he
doesn't,
then
the
police
will
ask
him
more
questions.
that's
all.
it's
no
big
deal.
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
i
would
say
that,
assuming
that
the
iowa
procedures
are
similar
to
michigan,
then
i
would
have
to
say
under
brewer
versus
williams
they
had,
because
we're
in
essentially
the
same
position
as
we
were
in
brewer.
i
don't
know
especially
about
iowa
law
and
i
don't
know
if
that's
that
significant.
if
we
say,
though...
and
here's
where
we
get
into
another
problem,
i
think,
with
sixth
amendment
rights,
and
if
we
get
into
the
question
of
waiver,
what
content
is
necessary
for
defendant
to
make
a
knowing
waiver,
is
if
we're
going
to
talk
about
when
the
trenches
are
dug
and
when
the
lines
are
aligned,
we're
going
to
have
to
say
it
either
begins
at
the
issuance
of
a
warrant
or
at
the
preliminary
examination.
because,
this
little
event
that
we
have
here,
this
little
meeting
in
the
courtroom,
does
nothing
to
change
the
position
of
the
parties.
they
aren't
now
more
committed
to
go
after
each
other
or
less
committed
to
go
after
each
other.
the
judge
is
merely
taking
care
of
some
administrative
functions.
so,
i
think
you're
going
to
have
to
either
go
to
the
issuance
of
the
warrant
when
the
state
has
said,
we
at
least
have
probable
cause
and
we're
at
least
going
to
arrest
the
guy
and
at
least
go
to
preliminary
hearing,
or
you're
going
to
have
to
go
all
the
way
to
preliminary
hearing
as
you
have
in
coleman
versus
alabama.
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
i
don't
view
it
as
less
protection.
i
view
it
as--
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
--yes,
but
i
think
again,
the
request
for
counsel
is
separate.
what
i
would
say...
perhaps
this
will
illustrate
where
i'm
coming
from
better,
the
michigan
supreme
court
claimed
that
their
rule
was
analogous
to
edwards,
and
i
think
that
is
completely
wrong.
the
analogy
to
edwards
in
the
sixth
amendment
setting
of
these
particular
requests
for
counsel
would
be
to
show
up
at
preliminary
examination
without
having
appointed
counsel
and
start
to
have
a
prelim,
because
he's
asked
for
counsel
during
the
judicial
process
and
now
you
return
to
the
judicial
process
without
counsel,
the
same
as
in
edwards
you
ask
for
counsel
during
interrogation,
you
return
to
interrogation
without
counsel.
that's
the
real
analogy.
that's
where
logic
would
take
you
if
you
were
trying
to
make
a
logical
and
analogical
analysis
of
this
case.
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
yes,
i
think
it
would
be
the
same
argument.
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
i
think
i
would,
but--
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
--i
think
i
would,
but
i
think
as
a
practical
matter
we
wouldn't
have
the
problem
because
the
public
defender
would
have
been
there
already
and
said,
"shut
up".
and
so,
we
wouldn't
have
had
anything.
he
would
have
told
the
attorney...
he
would
have
told
the
prosecutor
immediately,
he
would
have
filed
an
appearance
in
the
case,
and
said,
"don't
talk
to
him".
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
i
don't
think
it
is.
i
think
the
practicalities
of
that
have
some
impact.
but
i
don't
think
that
that
comes
down
to
it.
let's
take
an
example.
suppose
under
the
michigan
rule
the
defendant
were
to
come
into
this
initial
appearance
with
counsel
in
hand.
there
is
not
always
something
in
the
record
that
says
there
is
an
attorney
there.
the
judge
goes
through
the
same
advice,
says,
"you
have
a
right
to
an
attorney.
"
and
all
that.
he
asks
the
defendant
if
he
wants
to
stand
mute.
the
guy
says,
"yes,
stand
mute".
and
he
says,
"okay,
i'll
set
this
for
preliminary
examination
in
12
days.
"
now,
the
police
would
go
and
look
at
this
file,
as
the
michigan
supreme
court
suggested,
and
they'll
look
in
there
and
most
of
our
attorneys
at
least
don't
file
appearances
right
away,
retained
counsel,
and
he'll
look
in
there
and
there's
nothing
in
the
file
that
says
he's
ever
asked
for
an
attorney
even
at
this
initial
appearance.
so,
now
we
go
over
to
the
police,
the
police
station,
and
start
giving
him
his
miranda
warning.
we've
got
a
validly
waived
miranda
warning
and
they're
going
to
suppress
the
confession
because
the
police
didn't
have
some
crystal
ball
to
look
into
to
know
that
there
was
an
attorney
standing
next
to
him.
or,
the
other
alternative,
the
man
who
knows
he's
not
indigent
and
goes
into
the
courtroom
for
this
initial
appearance,
and
the
judge
says,
"if
you
don't
have
any
money
we
will
appoint
an
attorney
for
you.
"
"do
you
want
an
attorney
appointed?
"
"no",
he
says,
because
he
knows
he's
going
to
go
get
somebody
else.
the
police
come
in,
they
look
at
the
court
file.
there's
an
absence
of...
if
you
will,
a
denial
of
the
request
for
attorney.
now,
should
we
treat
that
differently--
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
--well,
i
don't
think
there
needs
to
be
a
line
to
cut
off
the
interrogation.
i
don't
think
that
counsel,
in
justice
rehnquist's
words,
at
one
point,
is
a
guru
that
the
defendant
always
has
to
go
through.
we're
trying...
we're
creating
this
creature
of
a
counsel
who
is
always
going
to
come
in
front
of
defendant,
and
i
don't
suggest
that
that's
appropriate,
especially
under
this
court's
analysis
in
faretta
and
that,
but
it's
the
defendant's
right,
not
the
attorney's
right.
again,
what
we're
saying
in
response
to
this,
the
only
burden
we're
placing
on
the
defendant,
the
highest
burden
he
ever
has
is
to,
after
this
initial
appearance,
say
when
the
police
mandatorily
give
him
miranda
rights,
"i
want
an
attorney".
and
it
all
stops.
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
no,
and
michigan
law
specifically
speaks
to
that
and
says
the
attorney
has
the
right
to
see
his
client
at
any
time,
and
i
think
that
should
be
the
rule.
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
well,
i
think
that
they
ought
not
be
precluded
from
going
in
and
talking
to
him.
they
may
have
to
advise
him
of
the
fact--
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
--yes,
but
i
think
maybe
the
content
of
what
they
tell
him,
in
addition
to
miranda
rights,
might
need
to
be
also,
"your
attorney
has
called
us".
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
i
think
that's
a
fair
requirement,
and
i
think
you
are
going
to
probably
address
that
in
virbine
to
some
extent,
when
you
decide
that.
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
well,
i
think
massiah,
brewer,
henry,
all
those
cases
have
the
same
problem,
that
there
was
never
a
waiver.
i
think
massiah
has
a
problem
of,
when
you've
got
the
surreptitious
entry
of
the
government,
there's
no
basis
to
find
a
waiver
because
there's
never
any
advice
of
the
circumstance
that
the
defendant's
in,
that
he's
even
being
interrogated.
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
yeah,
exactly,
but--
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
--i
don't
think
massiah
was
that
broad.
i
think
massiah
simply
said
that
in
this
context
the
sixth
amendment
was
violated
because
it
was
never
waived.
he
was
never
advised
of
his
rights
in
this
circumstance.
he
never
had
the
opportunity
to
waive
his
rights,
because
it
was
all
surreptitious.
and
brewer,
the
same
thing,
there
he
was
advised
of
rights
but
there
was
no
waiver,
and
i
think
in
our
circumstances
we
have
to
say
that
the
police
had
the
opportunity
even
after
the
sixth
amendment
has
attached,
because
i
think,
really,
the
logical
place
to
put
the
sixth
amendment
attachment
is
at
the
issuance
of
the
warrant,
and
if
that's
the
case
then
once
a
warrant's
issued
the
police
are
mum.
they
go
and
arrest
the
guy,
and
then
they
can't
tell
him
miranda
rights
even
before
this
initial
appearance.
i
don't
think
the
initial
appearance
is
a
significant
procedural
step
in
the
program.
i
think
the
warrant
is
one,
the
preliminary
examination
is
one,
but
i
don't
think
this
little
deal
that
we
have
here
is
important.
mr.
brian
e.
thiede
right.
they
specifically
said,
we
find
no
fifth
amendment...
no
right
under
the
fifth
amendment
invoked
by
the
statement.
we
find
no
fifth
amendment
violation.
we
find
simply
a
sixth
amendment
invocation
and
a
sixth
amendment
violation,
and
i
say
that
there
is
just
no
close
nexus
between
the
request
and
the
event
to
create
the
problem
that
the
michigan
supreme
court
saw.
if
there
are
no
other
questions
i
would
like
to
reserve
a
couple
of
seconds,
i
guess
i
don't
have
many
seconds.
