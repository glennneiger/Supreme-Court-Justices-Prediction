mr.
thiede,
does
michigan
also
proceed
sometimes
by
way
of
indictment
following
grand
jury
investigation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
then
there
would
be
no
preliminary
hearing,
there
would
be
a
grand
jury
indictment,
arraignment
and
trial?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
can
precede
the
trial?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
in
that
circumstance,
would
your
position
be
the
same?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
police
wanted
to
question
after
the
arraignment
and
when
counsel
had
been
requested?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
would
have
to
be...
what
would
your
position
be?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
suppose
it
is
not
explained
to
a
defendant
at
arraignment
in
michigan
that
there
is
this
difference,
as
you
see
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
the
defendant
would
perhaps...
if
unsophisticated,
at
least,
understand
that
the
attorney
that
was
requested
at
arraignment
would
be
an
attorney
that
would
be
available
to
assist
during
questioning
or
a
lineup
or
something
of
that--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
they
can
get
a
confession?
i
mean,
i'm
confused.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
the
language
used
at
arraignment,
when
the
defendant
is
asked--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--i
guess
they
can
do
that
before
arraignment.
don't
they
have
that
interval
of
time
before
arraignment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
isn't
there
a
period
of
time
before
arraignment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
when
the
police
clearly
can
go
in
and
make
an
inquiry
after
giving
miranda
rights?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
simply
want
to
extend
that
time
to
post-arraignment
and
until
the
preliminary
hearing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
what
you're
saying?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
thiede,
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
in
a
jurisdiction
which
used
office
of
the
public
defender
for
representation
of
indigents,
and
where
after
the
arraignment,
if
counsel
is
requested
and
the
public
defender
is
designated,
the
public
defender
traditionally
steps
in
and
takes
over
for
all
purposes
including
lineups
or
questioning
by
the
police
and
so
forth?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
would
make
the
same
argument?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
think
you
would
be
as
persuasive
about
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
your
argument
really
is
a
result
of
an
unusual
procedure
for
representation
for
indigents?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
shouldn't
the
line
be
drawn
at
the
initial
appearance
or
arraignment
stage?
what's
the
matter
with
that?
does
everybody
understand
that?
