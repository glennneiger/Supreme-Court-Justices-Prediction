if
the
man

a
lawyer,
my
own
lawyer,
at
this
preliminary
hearing.
can
he
have
a
lawyer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
why
can't
he
have
a
court
appointed
lawyer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
can't
he
have
a
court
appointed
lawyer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
he
can
have
a
paid
lawyer,
why
can't
he
have
a
court
appointed
lawyer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
when
you
pick
him
up
and
you
give
him
the
miranda
warnings--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--and
you
tell
him
you
will
appoint
a
lawyer
for
him,
you
don't
appoint
him
until
after
the
preliminary
hearings?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
correct?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
you
said
the
magistrate
couldn't
appoint
him.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
who
can
appoint
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
is
a
list
of
lawyers
for
a
preliminary
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
you
said
you
didn't.
justice
thurgood
marshall
am
i
confusing,
or
are
you
confusing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
in
the
meantime
anybody
can
question
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
did
you
mean
when
you
said
you
would
appoint
a
lawyer
for
him,
you
meant
12
days
hence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
just
said
so.
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
i
misunderstand
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don't
question
him
until
he
gets
a
lawyer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
correct?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
this
12-day
period?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean,
during
those
12
days
he's
not
examined
by
the
police?
justice
thurgood
marshall
wait
a
minute.
i
thought
that
during
this
12-day
period
they
could
come
in
20
times
a
day
and
ask
him
again
about
the
miranda--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--didn't
you
say
that
you
can
ask
him
if
he's
changed
his
mind?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
times
can
you
advise
him
of
his
miranda
rights?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
all
of
the
million
times,
you
can
ask
him
a
question?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
your
idea
of
not
questioning?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
your
idea
of
not
questioning?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
said
that
if
he
doesn't
get
a
lawyer,
you
should
stop
questioning.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
in
the
second
breath
you
say,
you
continuously
question
about
his
miranda
rights.
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
these
petitioners
ever
ask
for
an
attorney?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
didn't
get
enough
out
of
him
the
other
times?
