justice
byron
r.
white
the
case
has
begun,
though,
hasn't
it?
the
criminal
process
has
begun?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
a
charge?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
doesn't
massiah
just
prevent
the
officers
from
going
to
him
at
all
once
the
criminal
proceeding
has
started?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
when
they
go
to
him
at
all,
once
the
right
to
counsel
is
attached
and
the
case
is
begun,
what
they
want
is
information,
they
want
to
interrogate
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
shouldn't
massiah
just
prevent
them
from
even--
justice
byron
r.
white
--so,
the
michigan
court
said
this
request
for
counsel
at
the
arraignment,
that
is
what
triggered
a
rule
like
edwards?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
counsel,
suppose...
suppose
the
defendant
had
not,
at
the
arraignment
said,
"i
want
counsel".
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
what
if
he
hadn't
said
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
right
to
counsel
attached
then,
didn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
said,
i
don't
care
to
have
counsel
appointed.
could
the
officers
then
have
gone
to
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
i...
that's
what
your
argument
that
you're
just
making
says,
once
the
criminal
process
is
really
begun,
the
officers
must
stay
away
from
him
unless
he
goes
to
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
or
not
he's
said
what
he
said
at
the
arraignment?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
defendant
in
this
case
had
approached
the
officers?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
was
thinking
you
would
say
that
a
much
higher
standard
of
waiver
would
be
required
than
in
edwards.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
asking
for
a
good
deal
more
than
the
michigan
supreme
court
gave
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
aren't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
because
they
hinge
their
entire
analysis
on
his
request
for
counsel.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
that
isn't
even
necessary
to
win
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
only
argument
you've
made.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
often
does
a
defendant
say
at
his
arraignment,
"i
don't
want
counsel"?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
hardly
ever
see
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
you
could
argue
that
any
police
officer
who
knows
that
an
arraignment
has
taken
place
should
assume
that
he's
asked
for
counsel?
