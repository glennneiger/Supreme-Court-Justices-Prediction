mr.
ronald
j.
bretz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
join
in
counsel
for
respondent
jackson's
arguments
concerning
the
higher
standard
of
waiver
for
the
sixth
amendment.
i
would
like
to
spend
my
limited
time
before
the
court
discussing
the
specific
holding
of
the
michigan
supreme
court
and
the
application
of
the
edwards
rule.
the
court's
holding,
and
our
position
in
this
case
is
that
the
interrogation
of
the
respondents
following
their
unequivocal
request
for
counsel
at
arraignment
violated
their
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendment
rights.
the
court's
holding
was
based
on
one
elementary
premise,
and
that
is
that
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
is
a
broad,
fundamental
right
to
counsel
that
is
provided
for
specifically
in
the
constitution,
and
as
a
result
it
differs
significantly
from
the
miranda
right
to
counsel
which
is
referred
to
as
the
fifth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
the
sixth
amendment
provides
the
right
to
counsel
at
all
stages
of
the
proceedings
including,
in
this
case,
the
post-arraignment
interrogations.
i
think
under
this
court's
decision
in
brewer
it
is
very
clear
that
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
applied
during
that
interrogation.
the
fifth
amendment
right
was
designed
only
to
protect
the
defendant's
rights
to
remain
silent
and
as
has
been
stated
before
this
court,
it
routinely
applies
in
the
pre-arraignment
custodial
interrogation.
the
premise
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
is
a
broader
and
more
fundamental
right
than
the
judicially
created
fifth
amendment
right,
i
believe
is
self
evident,
and
is
amply
supported
by
this
court's
decisions.
it
follows,
i
believe,
from
that
premise
that
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
must
be
at
least
as
scrupulously
honored
as
the
fifth
amendment
right.
in
the
cases
before
this
court,
specifically
in
my
client's
case,
mr.
bladel
requested
counsel
from
a
judge
at
arraignment.
following
that
request
he
told
the
police
officers
during
the
miranda
warning
at
the
point
where
they
advised
him,
"you
have
a
right
to
an
attorney.
"
he
advised
them,
"i
already
asked
the
judge
for
an
attorney.
"
under
the
sixth
amendment
he
had
the
right--
mr.
ronald
j.
bretz
--absolutely...
well,
my
initial
argument
is
that
they
shouldn't
even
have
been
in
there
giving
him
the
warnings
in
the
first
place,
under
the
application
of
the
edwards
rule,
the
police
officers.
they
should
have
left
him
alone
pursuant
to
the
rigid
prophylactic
rule
of
edwards.
mr.
ronald
j.
bretz
assuming
that
they
were
not
aware
of
that,
i
believe
that
at
the
point
that
my
client
advised
the
police
that,
"i've
already
asked
for
an
attorney
at
arraignment.
"
and
according
to
the
police
he
said,
"i
haven't
seen
him
yet.
"
"i
don't
know
where
he
is.
"
i
think,
yes,
in
answer
to
your
question,
that
should
have
stopped
it
right
there.
the
police
had
been
made
aware
of
the
circumstances.
the
defendant
had
alerted
them
of
his
request
for
counsel.
that
should
have
stopped
the
proceedings,
that
is,
the
interrogation
until
counsel
was
made
present.
i
think
it's
also
important
in
this
case
that
my
client
had
sat
in
this
jail
for
three
full
days
without
speaking
to
any
lawyer.
the
only
people
he
spoke
to
were
the
police
officers.
at
a
minimum,
i
would
ask
this
court
to
apply
the
rigid
bright
line
rule
of
edwards
versus
arizona
to
this
case
and
to
any
case
where
the
defendant
has
invoked
his
right
to
counsel
whether
that
request
is
directed
to
a
judge
or
to
a
police
officer.
that
is
the
distinction
that
petitioner
has
raised
before
this
court
today.
the
way
i
hear
his
argument
is
that,
somehow
my
client's
request
for
counsel
was
less
effective
because
he
directed
it
only
to
a
judge
and
not
to
the
police
officers.
in
his
brief,
petitioner
argues
that
respondent
only
exercised
a
portion
of
his
sixth
amendment
right
to
have
counsel
present
in
the
courtroom
and
not
the
interrogation
room.
mr.
ronald
j.
bretz
well,
your
honor,
in
my
experience
i
don't
see
that.
mr.
ronald
j.
bretz
absolutely
not,
even
in--
mr.
ronald
j.
bretz
--exactly,
and
in
this
case
the
facts
are...
that
is
the
bladel
case...
the
facts
are
that
the
interrogating
officers'
superior,
that
is,
the
chief
investigator
on
the
case,
was
in
fact
present
at
arraignment,
so
there's
no
great
burden
of
having
to
read
ambiguous
court
files,
they
just
call
the
boss
and
he
could
have
told
him.
but,
that's
okay
because
my
client
told
them.
the
petitioner's
distinction
between
where
this
request
is
directed,
i
believe
is
artificial.
the
sixth
amendment
as
i
have
said
applies
to
all
stages
including
this
interrogation.
while
there
are
differences
in
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
rights
that
the
prosecutor
hinges
his
entire
argument
upon,
i
think
it
is
highly
improbable
that
these
distinctions
are
understood
by
a
typical
criminal
defendant,
and
this
goes
to
the
question
justice
o'connor
directed
to
petitioner.
i
believe
a
typical
criminal
defendant,
once
he
has
told
a
judge,
"i
want
counsel",
has
done
all
that
he
can
do
to
have
his
right
honored.
the
right
to
counsel,
to
this
defendant
or
to
any
defendant,
is
in
fact
the
right
to
counsel.
hair-splitting
does
not
enter
into
the
picture.
he
should
be
entitled
to
presume
that
he
has
done
all
that
he
can
do
to
secure
this
valuable
right
without
having
to
worry
about
whether
he
has
directed
his
request
to
the
right
authority.
this
court
should
adopt
the
rule
that
any
request
bars
further
interrogation,
and
there
is
yet
another
reason
for
adopting
this
rule,
other
than
the
sixth
amendment.
it
is
a
bright
line
rule.
i
think
that's
extremely
important.
that's
what
makes
edwards
and
miranda,
because
i
believe
they
must
be
read
together,
that's
what
makes
them
such
effective
decisions.
such
a
bright
line
rule
as
we
are
proposing
in
this
case
would
in
fact
ease
the
administration
of
justice,
would
make
the
job
of
the
courts
much
easier.
counsel
is
requested;
that's
it.
no
interrogation,
unless
defendant
initiates
it.
it
would
make
the
job
of
the
police,
i
believe,
much
easier,
and
i
believe
as
this
court
has
stated
before,
that
the
police
operating
in
the
field
need
bright
line
rules.
i
also
don't
think
it
is
wise,
after
the
sixth
amendment
has
attached,
to
make
the
police
the
legal
advisor
of
the
defendant.
perhaps
that
is
necessary
in
miranda
because
in
miranda
the
defendant...
prior
to
the
miranda
decision
the
suspect
did
not
have
a
right
to
counsel
in
an
interrogation
room.
this
court
in
miranda
felt
that
was
necessary,
and
i
believe
the
waiver
designed
in
miranda
is
adequate
for
that
situation.
i
believe
that
the
purpose
of
edwards
as
defined
by
this
court
in
illinois
versus
smith
is
furthered
by
the
decision
in
this
case.
the
purpose
of
edwards
was
to
prevent
the
badgering
or
the
wearing
down
of
the
suspect
into
giving
up
a
right
once
he
has
invoked
it.
if
you
look
at
the
facts
of
this
case,
that
is
my
case,
the
bladel
case,
he
sat
there
for
three
days
after
asking
for
an
attorney,
not
knowing
what
was
happening.
he
testified
at
his
suppression
hearing
that,
"i
really
didn't
know
if
i
was
qualified,
if
they
were
going
to
give
me
an
attorney.
"
the
finder
of
fact
at
the
suppression
hearing
did
not
discredit
that
testimony
and
in
fact
that
testimony
was
adopted
in
the
michigan
supreme
court's
decision.
i
think
it's
important.
there
is
the
possibility
here
that
the
failure
to
provide
counsel
timely,
the
re-interrogation
by
the
police
in
the
absence
of
counsel,
had
the
effect
of
wearing
down
mr.
bladel
into
giving
up
the
right
he
had
already
invoked.
but
again,
i
would
remind
the
court
that
under
the
illinois
versus
smith
decision,
actual
coercion
is
not
relevant
in
an
edwards
inquiry.
if
this
court
finds
the
edwards
rule
applicable,
whether
directly
or
by
analogy,
i
think
that's
the
end
of
the
question.
the
cases
here
have
to
be
affirmed,
the
decision
of
the
michigan
supreme
court.
waiver
is
not
an
issue.
if
the
court
does
not
accept
the
edwards
analysis,
i
think
there
is
still
the
question
of
waiver
that
must
be
reached,
which
is
why
we
have
briefed
that
issue
and
raised
it
before
the
court.
very
briefly,
i
think
counsel
for
respondent
jackson
gave
the
waiver
argument
to
this
court,
and
as
i
said
i
join
in
it,
but
i
would
just
ask
this
court
to
look
very
carefully
at
that
because
this
court
has
never
defined
precisely
the
standards
for
waiver
in
a
sixth
amendment
interrogation
context
as
we
have
in
these
cases.
the
massiah,
henry...
the
trio
of
cases
dealing
with
sixth
amendment
confessions,
this
court
found
a
violation
of
the
right
in
all
those
cases.
mr.
ronald
j.
bretz
thank
you,
justice
white.
massiah,
henry
and
brewer,
there
was
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
in
all
three
of
those
cases.
waiver
did
not
become
the
issue.
the
only
sixth
amendment
waiver
cases
that
this
court
has
deal
with
the
right
to
counsel
at
trial
or
at
a
guilty
plea
refer
to
faretta,
johnson
versus
zerbst,
by
moltke
versus
gillies.
as
i
have
argued
in
my
brief
and
as
the
second
circuit
has
adopted,
a
faretta
type
waiver
is
certainly
a
more
appropriate
standard
of
waiver
in
this
context,
now
that
the
sixth
amendment
has
attached,
more
appropriate
than
the
miranda
waiver,
and
i
would
ask
the
court
to
look
at
that
for
purposes
of
a
waiver
decision
in
this
case.
in
conclusion,
i
would
ask
this
court
to
adopt
the
decision
of
the
michigan
supreme
court.
i
think
that
it
is
a
rational,
logical
decision;
that
it
is
constitutionally
necessary
to
protect
the
valued
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
i
would
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
michigan
supreme
court.
