william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
krogsrud,
do
you
think
that
the
right
to
counsel
made
available
by
the
miranda
case
under
the
fifth
amendment
is
a
more
easily
waived
right
than
the
right
to
counsel
contained
in
the
constitution
in
the
sixth
amendment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
should
that
be?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
of
course
if
an
individual
clearly
wants
to
talk
to
the
police,
no
matter
how
high
the
standard
of
waiver,
that
standard
could
be
met.
we're
talking
about,
i
suppose,
slightly
more
ambiguous
circumstances,
and
then
you
say
that...
where
it's
the
miranda
right
to
counsel
involved,
you
need
less
in
the
way
of
waiver
than
where
it's
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel?
