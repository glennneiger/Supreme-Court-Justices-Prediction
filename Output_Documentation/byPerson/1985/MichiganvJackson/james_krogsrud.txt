mr.
james
krogsrud
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
before
beginning
my
argument
i
would
like
to
first
note
that
i
do
not
intend
to
argue
the
first
issue
in
the
brief.
we
are
not
waiving
that
issue.
that
is
the
issue
dealing
with
the
independent
state
grounds.
the
important
question
before
this
court
deals
with
the
question
of
waiver
of
the
constitutional
right
to
counsel.
that
is
the
right
that
gives
meaning
to
all
other
rights.
in
our
brief
we
have
set
out
three
alternatives
for
analysis.
one
was
that
the
request
for
counsel
at
arraignment
was
at
least
an
ambiguous
request
for
counsel
under
the
fifth
amendment;
second,
the
edwards
analogy
that
the
michigan
supreme
court
adopted;
and
third,
a
general
waiver
rule
analysis.
what
i'd
like
to
do
this
morning
is
approach
this
case
from
the
point
of
view
of
general
waiver,
the
general
waiver
rule.
i
think
in
doing
so
it
will
become
very
clear
why
the
michigan
supreme
court
ruling
offers
a
great
deal
of
appeal
and
is
an
appropriate
rule
for
this
court
to
adopt.
in
1938,
in
johnson
versus
zerbst,
this
court
announced
a
general
rule
of
waiver
for
the
right
to
counsel.
there
are
two
aspects
of
that
rule
which
i
think
i
would
like
to
just
mention.
first,
it's
required
that
the
waiver
be
voluntary,
knowing
and
intelligent.
intelligent
means
that
there
must
be
an
understanding
of
it.
second,
and
this
may
be
the
key
in
this
particular
case,
courts
indulge
every
reasonable
presumption
against
waiver.
what
the
state
is
arguing
today
is
that
the
burden
should
be
on
the
defendant
to
say
that
he
didn't
mean...
he
didn't
really
mean
when
he
requested
counsel
at
the
arraignment
that
he
wanted
it
for
arraignment,
he
just
wanted
it
for
court
proceedings.
state
has
put
the
burden
on
the
defendant.
the
court,
in
1938
and
in
many
cases
subsequent
to
1938,
the
johnson
versus
zerbst
opinion,
has
said,
courts
indulge
every
reasonable
presumption
against
waiver.
there
are
two
critical
facts
and
two
well-founded
presumptions
which,
i
think,
are
applicable
in
this
case
and
perhaps
virtually
every
other
case
like
the
cases
of
mr.
jackson
and
mr.
bladel.
the
first
key
fact
is
that
we're
dealing
with...
the
adversary
proceedings
have
begun.
i
take
issue
with
the
state
this
morning
that
says
that
arraignment
is
merely
a
ministerial
function
and
it
has
no
meaning.
it
is
the
time
when
the
state
has
formally
said,
we
are
going
to
charge
and
we
are
going
to
prosecute
and
try
to
convict
this
individual.
there
is
no
reason
except
for
the
gathering
of
evidence
against
the
accused
why
the
police
are
talking
to...
want
to
talk
to
the
individual
after
adversary
proceedings
have
begun.
the
second
important
fact
is
that
in
this
case,
mr.
jackson
has
made
an
unequivocal
and
affirmative
request
for
counsel.
he
did
so
at
arraignment.
i
believe
that
under
those
circumstances
the
likelihood
of
an
understanding
waiver
while
solely
in
police
custody
is
so
remote
that
the
edwards
rule,
which
in
essence
is
a
prophylactic
rule
barring
the
police
from
interrogating
an
individual
except
under
unusual
circumstances--
mr.
james
krogsrud
--i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
james
krogsrud
well,
i
think
that
it
may
not
necessarily
be
in
every
case.
the
court
has
said
that
in
deciding
whether
there
is
waiver
of
either
the
fifth
or
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel,
that
the
same
test
applies,
that
is,
the
johnson
versus
zerbst
standard,
and
that
looks
to
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
perhaps
i
went
to
far
in
assuming...
or
i
assumed
too
much
in
your
question,
but
my
assumption
was
that
the
fifth
amendment
right
to
counsel
is
one
that
is
ordinarily
assumed
to
apply
prior
to
arraignment,
prior
to
the
time
the
state
has
formally
charged
the
individual.
at
that
time,
it
may
be
that
the
police
are
trying
to
find...
decide
whether
the
individual
is
a
suspect
to
be
accused,
or
whether
he
is
to
be
let
go.
there
are
some
circumstances
under
which
it
may
be
appropriate
for
the
individual
to
want
to
talk
to
the
police,
not
so
after
arraignment
has
begun.
mr.
james
krogsrud
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
state,
as
i
said
earlier,
that
there
are
two
presumptions
that
are
important
to
consider
and
which...
in
viewing
these
presumptions
will
make
it
clear
that
the
edwards
rule
is
one
that
is
appropriate.
the
first
presumption
is
that
a
layman
is
unlikely
to
understand
the
value
of
counsel.
i
think
that
is
abundantly
clear
from
reading
many
of
the
decisions
of
this
court,
particularly
starting
with
powell
versus
alabama
in
1932
where
the
court
said,
even
the
intelligent
and
educated
layman
requires
the
guiding
hand
of
counsel
at
every
step
of
the
proceedings
against
him.
the
second
presumption
is
that
a
layman
is
unlikely
to
understand
the
dangers
of
talking
with
police.
there
has
been
a
decision
to
prosecute
in
these
cases.
these
individuals
have
been
formally
charged.
they
are
no
longer
suspects;
they
are
defendants.
the
police
are
no
longer
seeking
to
exculpate;
they
are
seeking
to
convict.
these
presumptions
are
so
strong
that
there
are
virtually
no
reasons
for
waiver
and
a
prophylactic
rule
is
very
appropriate
in
this
case.
the
cases
that
have
found
that
there
has
been
waiver
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
like
the
state
today,
have
made
an
upside-down
application
of
the
rule
of
johnson
versus
zerbst.
that
is,
they
have
said,
in
essence,
that
the
burden
is
on
the
individual
to
show
that
he
wants
counsel,
whereas
courts
must
indulge
every
reasonable
presumption
against
the
waiver.
if
you
look
at
what
happened
in
the
case
of
robert
jackson,
i
think
that
these
cases
take
on
life.
the
police
are
not
in
a
position
to
advise
the
defendant
of
the
value
of
counsel
or
of
the
dangers
of
talking
with
the
police.
in
this
particular
case,
robert
jackson's
case,
the
police
told
mr.
white,
a
co-defendant,
what
the
value
of
a
lawyer
was.
they
said,
if
you
want
a
lawyer
he'll
tell
you,
don't
talk
to
the
police.
but
the
lawyer
doesn't
go
to
jail,
does
he?
the
lawyer
gets
paid
by
how
many
days
in
trial,
and
if
you
talk
with
us
there
will
be
a
guilty
plea
and
no
trial.
when
it
came
it
advising
regarding
the
dangers
of
talking
with
police,
the
police
said,
we
control
the
criminal
justice
system.
we
tell
the
prosecutor
what's
going
to
be
charged,
whether
it's
going
to
be
murder
one,
murder
two
or
manslaughter,
or
something
less.
we
are
the
ones
that
advise
the
probation
department
whether
you
have
cooperated
with
the
police,
and
the
judge
looks
to
the
pre-sentence
report
and
the
probation
officer
to
decide
what
sentence
will
be
imposed.
in
conclusion,
in
the
landmark
decision
of
powell
versus
alabama,
justice
sutherland
stated,
"even
the
intelligent
and
educated
layman
requires
the
guiding
hand
of
counsel
at
every
step
in
the
proceedings
against
him.
"
"every
intelligent
and
wealthy
person
will
have
counsel
after
they
have
been
formally
charged
by
the
state.
"
"no
lawyer
or
judge
would
allow
a
friend
or
relative
to
talk
to
police
without
counsel
after
formal
charges
have
been
brought.
"
this
court
must
ensure
that
the
precious
right
to
counsel,
guaranteed
to
the
poor
and
ignorant--
mr.
james
krogsrud
--he
did
say
that
in
this
case.
mr.
james
krogsrud
well,
if
he
had
not
said
it--
mr.
james
krogsrud
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
krogsrud
i
think
not.
i
think
that
under--
mr.
james
krogsrud
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
krogsrud
i
agree,
your
honor,
unless...
i
will
add
one
proviso.
perhaps
the
magistrate
could
go
through
the
analysis
in...
the
specific
analysis
in
johnson
versus
zerbst
that
says
a
judicial
officer
could
inquire
as
to
all
the
circumstances,
perhaps
could
obtain
a
waiver,
but
those
would
be
the
only
circumstances
under
which
the
police
could
then
interrogate.
let
me
add
that
once
a
citizen
has
been
formally
charged
and
has
requested
counsel,
that
citizen
is
entitled
to
due
process,
not
police
process.
mr.
james
krogsrud
well,
your
honor,
if
we
look
at
the
edwards
analogy,
there
still
has
to
be
a
decision--
mr.
james
krogsrud
--i
agree,
your
honor,
and
i
think
in
offering
the
edwards
analogy,
we're
simply
saying
if
this
court--
mr.
james
krogsrud
--your
honor,
the
reason--
mr.
james
krogsrud
--i
am,
your
honor.
mr.
james
krogsrud
that
is
correct.
your
honor.
mr.
james
krogsrud
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
that
it's
not
a
position...
or
it
is
not
something
that
this
court
has
to
reach,
but
i
think
that--
mr.
james
krogsrud
--i
did
that,
your
honor,
and
i
said
so
at
the
outset
because
i
think
in
looking
down
the
road,
i
think
you
can
see
the
value
of
taking
the
step
that
the
michigan
supreme
court
did
take.
mr.
james
krogsrud
no,
there
is
no
careful
inquiry
required.
