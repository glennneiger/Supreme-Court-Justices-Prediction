justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
at
this
point,
supposing
the
judge...
at
that
point
there
had
been
a
lawyer
sitting
in
the
courtroom
and
he
said,
"i'll
appoint
mr.
smith
as
your
lawyer.
"
smith
said,
"i'm
too
busy
to
talk
to
you
now.
"
"i'll
see
you
in
three
or
four
days.
"
would
the
rule
the
apply,
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
under
your
view
should--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
would
say,
then
the
police
could
still
initiate
interrogation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
stop
you
there
for
a
minute.
suppose
he
was
non-indigent,
had
his
own
lawyer
and
knew
it
all
the
time.
is
it
proper
in
the...
he
already
had
a
preliminary
hearing
and
the
police
know
who
his
lawyer
is.
in
your
view,
is
it
all
right
for
the
police
to
initiate
interrogation
without
telling
counsel?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
this
is
after
the
preliminary
hearing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
suppose
he
shows
up
with
a
lawyer
at
that
hearing.
he's
got
plenty
of
money.
and
then
the
lawyer
leaves
and
the
police
take
him
back
to
the
police
station
after
that
very
hearing.
can
they
initiate--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
don't
think
it's
possible
to
set
up
a
procedure
whereby
as
soon
as
he
makes
a
request
like
that
you
would
immediately
be
notified?
you
don't
think
you're
capable
of
doing
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
interrupt
with
a
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
a
particular
judge
or
magistrate,
i
forget
the
exact
title,
at
that
particular
hearing
went
ahead
and
said,
by
the
way,
i
might
as
well
also
explain
to
you
what
the
miranda
warnings
are,
and
he
reads
him
the
miranda
warning
and
then
gets
all
through
and
says,
now,
do
you
want
to
fill
out
the
form.
the
fellow
says,
yes,
i
want
a
lawyer,
but
it's
kind
of
ambiguous.
what
would
your
position
be?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
the
judge
had
given
him
the
substance
of
the
miranda
warning?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
saying
the
police
would
have...
even
if
it's
ambiguous
and
even
if
the
other
case
is...
even
if
he
has
a
lawyer,
you
still
say
the
police
have
a
right
to
initiate--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
one
other
question.
at
the
point
in...
that
the
michigan
supreme
court
considers
significant
in
this
case,
the
hearing,
whatever
you
properly
call
it,
in
your
view
had
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
attached?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
thing
that
puzzles
me
about
your
position
is,
if
you
agree
that
the
sixth
amendment
right
is
attached,
normally
we're
a
little
more
strict
after
the
sixth
amendment
right
attaches
than
under
the
fifth
amendment
right
under
miranda.
you
are
in
effect
saying
that
there
should
be
less
protection
in
the
sixth
amendment
context
than
there
would
be
in
the
miranda
context?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
in
one
case
you
could
initiate
conversation
and
in
the
other
you
can't?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
your
sequence,
supposing
during
this
12-day
period
they
decide
to
question
him,
say
two
or
three
days
later,
and
just
before
they
question
him
a
lawyer
calls
up
and
says,
"i've
been
appointed
and
i
want
to
come
in
and
talk
to
him.
"
could
they
say,
"we're
sorry,
you
can't
talk
to
him
for
two
days
because
we
want
to
find
out
if
he
wants
to
waive?
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
if
he
says,
"i'll
be
over
there
in
two
hours.
"
and
they
then
say,
"well,
before
he
gets
here
i'd
like
to
ask
him
if
he
would
like
to
waive
his
rights.
"
could
they
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
the
lawyer
does?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
they
would
have
that
obligation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask,
at
this
hearing
as
it
is
handled
in
michigan,
what
does
the
judge
do
if
the
defendant
says,
"i
don't
want
a
lawyer"?
does
he
have
kind
of
a
faretta
type
waiver,
or
does
he
just
say,
no
lawyer
requested,
and
that's
the
end
of
it?
is
there
any
careful
inquiry?
