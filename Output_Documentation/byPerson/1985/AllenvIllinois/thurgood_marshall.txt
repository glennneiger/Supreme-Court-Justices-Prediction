justice
thurgood
marshall
excuse
me.
did
he
have
preponderance,
or
did
he
have
reasonable
doubt?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
possible
in
a
civil
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
the
hearing
held
in
the
institution
or
in
the
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
rotert,
one
point
i
am
worried
about
is,
at
the
hearing,
if
the
judge
put
the
respondent
on
the
stand
and
asked
him
a
question,
and
the
guy
said,
i
refuse
to
testify,
what
could
you
do
about
it?
nothing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
not
talking
about
grand
jury.
i
am
talking
about
the
proceeding
in
this
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
judge
put
him
on
the
stand,
and
asked
him
a
question,
and
the
respondent
says,
on
the
basis
of
the
fifth
amendment,
i
refuse
to
answer.
would
that
be
recognized?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
this
is
a
civil
procedure
which
ends
up
with
a
jail
sentence.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
it
is
a
jail,
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
a
jail,
isn't
it--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--it
is
not
a
jail?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
has
bars?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
can't
get
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
it
is
not
a
jail?

thurgood
marshall
well,
didn't
the
law
say
out
there
that
you
are
compelled
under
penalty
of
being
held
in
contempt?

that
or
is
that
not
the
law
of
illinois?
justice
thurgood

it
the
law?

thurgood
marshall
that
if
you
don't
testify,

justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
consider
that
compulsion?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,

i
for
one
decided
that
this
has
enough
of
the
indicia
of
a
criminal
prosecution
to
require

then
