but
how
would
you
prove
the
mental
condition?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
when
a
person
being
committed
has
refused
to
speak
at
all
to
the
examining
physician?
you
have
seen
cases
like
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
rotert,
the
provisions
for
commitment
under
this
proceeding
result
in
an
indefinite
commitment,
as
i
understand
it,
without
any
provision
for
periodic
review
at
the
instance
of
the
state,
unlike
your
ordinary
involuntary
civil
commitment
proceeding.
is
that
true?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
would
you
explain
why
that
is
not--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--how
does
it
differ
from
what
would
happen
with
an
ordinary
involuntary
commitment
to
a
mental
institution--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--for
purposes
of
review?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
am
talking
about
the
review
mechanism
only.
could
you
focus
on
that
for
me
and
tell
me
how
it
differs,
please,
from
that
of
an
involuntary
civil
commitment
of
the
normal
type?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
the
civil
proceeding
is
it
brought
to
the
court
and
the
state
must
prove
by
a
preponderance
that
the
commitment
should
continue?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
doesn't
occur
with
these
proceedings?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
difference
is
significant
for
our
purposes
under
in
re
gault?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
your
involuntary
commitment
in
illinois,
is
it
not
necessary
to
prove
that
the
person
is
dangerous
to
himself
or
others
to
be
involuntarily
committed?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
rotert,
does
in
re
gault
provide
the
tests
that
we
should
employ
in
determining
whether
it
should
be
treated
as
a
criminal
proceeding
for
purposes
of
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
you
do
have
to
find
the
underlying
criminal
offense
was
committed.
