mr.
mark
l.
rotert
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
there
are
several
points
on
which
respondents
differ
significantly
from
the
petitioner
on
both
the
facts
and
the
law
that
are
relevant
to
this
particular
inquiry
this
morning.
one
of
the
most
important
differences
that
i
would
like
to
emphasize
at
the
outset
is
that
the
immunity
provision
as
provided
by
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
this
very
case
is
coextensive
with
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
which
the
respondent
to
a
sexually
dangerous
persons
act
should
have.
there
is
no
question
that
the
respondent
to
a
sexually
dangerous
persons
proceeding
has
the
ability
to
claim
a
fifth
amendment
privilege
in
any
proceeding,
but
there
is
also
no
question
that
in
this
case
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
immunized
that
person.
nothing
that
terry
allen
said
to
any
psychiatrist
at
any
point
in
time
can
ever
be
used
against
him
in
any
criminal
prosecution
for
the
underlying
sex
offenses.
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
made
that
very
clear.
and
this
is
coextensive
with
the
fifth
amendment
privilege,
and
this
court
has
recognized
that
repeatedly,
that
transactional
immunity
is
not
what
the
fifth
amendment
requires.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
that
is
certainly
true,
justice
rehnquist,
and
i
think
that
leads
us
to
the
second
major
fundamental
distinction
between
the
parties,
and
that
is
the
position
of
the
state
of
illinois
that
this
is
a
civil
statute.
it
is
a
civil
statute
because
the
legislature
that
drafted
it
and
enacted
it
said
it
was
civil.
it
is
a
civil
statute
because
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
which
has
had
the
opportunity
to
evaluate
it,
has
concluded
it
to
be
civil.
and
it
is
a
civil
statute
because
in
its
effect
and
in
its
purpose
it
does
what
a
civil
statute
is
designed
to
do.
now,
i
admit
that
it
does
it
in
the
context
of
due
process
safeguards
which
are
often
found
in
criminal
cases,
but
we
point
out
in
our
brief
how
ironic
it
is
that
the
state
of
illinois
provides
more
due
process
safeguards
to
a
civil
proceeding
and
the
result
is
that
people
therefore
identify
it
as
a
criminal
prosecution,
and
i
think
that
that
is
the
ironic
result
that
is
proffered
to
the
court
this
morning.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
your
honor,
i
believe
that
if
the
respondent
to
a
sexually
dangerous
persons
proceeding
is
put
in
that
circumstance
he
faces
the
same
options
that
a
grand
jury
witness
would
have
faced
had
he
been
given--
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
--in
this
case.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
it
would
be
recognized
if
he
were
claiming
the
privilege
for
any
criminal
prosecution
that
might
result,
because
he
can
claim
it
at
any
time,
but
it
would
not
be
recognized
if
he
said,
i
refuse
to
answer
because
i
think
i
might
be
found
sexually
dangerous
as
a
result
of
my
answer,
because
being
found
sexually
dangerous
is
not
a
criminal
prosecution,
conviction,
or
punishment,
so
it
is
not
something
that
the
fifth
amendment
would
provide
protection
for.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
it
is
a
civil
provision
which
ends
up
with
nothing
of
the
sort,
justice
marshall,
and
that
is
another
very
serious
factual
distinction
between
the
parties.
the
idea
that
this
is
a
criminal
sentence
is
simply
not
supported
by
the
data
that
is
before
the
court.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
it
is
a
facility
for
psychiatric
care--
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
--no,
your
honor,
it
is--
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
--it
is
not
a
jail.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
it
has
bars.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
you
are
not
free
to
leave.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
justice
marshall--
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
--it
is
an
institution.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
no,
your
honor,
not
like
sing
sing.
0
[generallaughter.]
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
there
are
many
institutions,
not
all
of
which
are
like
sing
sing,
justice
marshall.
this
particular
institution
is
staffed
by
a
psychiatrist,
not
by
a
warden.
it
is
staffed
by
mental
health
care
professionals,
not
by
guards.
it
is
an
institution
which
does
restrict
the
liberty
of
someone
who
is
a
sexually
dangerous
person.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
you
have
the
right
to
all
the
facilities
available
to
anyone
at
the
menard
institution.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
i
understand,
justice
marshall,
that
that
is
your
belief,
but
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
what
you
would
conclude
if
you
had
an
opportunity
to
examine
all
of
the
data.
if
you
had
an
opportunity
to
consider
that
it
offers
vocational
and
educational
training,
that
it
offers
psychiatric
therapy,
group
milieu
therapy.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
mr.
justice
marshall--
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
--that's
correct.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
that
is
not
correct.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
the
dining
arrangements
may
well
be
such
that
they
eat
in
the
same
facility--
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
--it
is
true,
justice
marshall.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
but
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
insisted
years
ago
that
the
person
committed
under
the
sexually
dangerous
persons
act
is
not
to
be
kept
at
menard
prison.
he
is
not
to
be
treated
like
a
prisoner
at
the
menard
penitentiary.
he
is
not
to
be
kept
down
there
without
receiving
psychiatric
care.
this
is
something
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
been
very
insistent
about.
they
have
said,
if
you
treat
him
like
he
is
in
menard
prison,
we
will
have
a
problem,
but
you
will
not
so
treat
him.
you
will
provide
therapy.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
menard
psychiatric
institute
has
about
30
sexually
dangerous
persons.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
about
30
sexually
dangerous
persons
respondents
are
there.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
i
am
not
aware
of
the
number
of
psychiatrists
on
staff.
i
know
that
the
director
of
the
institutions
is
a
psychiatrist.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
he
is
an
md
with
a
specialty
in
psychiatry.
i
think
something
else
that--
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
--please.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
most
certainly.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
there
are
about
300
in
the
menard
psychiatric
center
at
any
given
moment.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
the
whole
unit.
justice
stevens,
i
don't
know
the
number
of
the
population
at
menard
prison.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
but
menard
prison
is
one
of
the
three
major
maximum
security
facilities
in
the
state
department
of
corrections.
it
is
most
certainly
a
maximum
security
prison.
is
the
hospital
portion
of
menard...
i
don't
know,
whatever
portion
the
300
represents
of
the
total,
is
that
also
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
department
of
corrections?
it
is
managed
by
the
department
of
corrections
jurisdictionally.
it
is
staffed
by
psychiatrists
and
health
care
professionals.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
this
is
correct.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
they
intermingle.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
they
intermingle,
justice
stevens,
and
i
think
that
it
is
important
to
remember
that
the
menard
psychiatric
institute
is
not
warehousing
these
people.
it
is
not
throwing
them
into
cells
and
forgetting
that
they
exist.
in
point
of
fact,
the
american
correctional
association
in
1980
made
the
menard
psychiatric
institution
the
first
state
facility
of
its
kind
among
the
50
states
for
accreditation
for
its
psychiatric
care
unit.
it
has
been
reaccredited
since
in
1983.
it
is
a
place
where
people
receive
treatment
from
health
care
professionals
who
want
to
provide
treatment.
i
won't
deny
that
their
liberty
is
restrained,
but
i
will
vigorously
resist
the
implication
that
they
are
just...
good
as
being
in
jail.
the
petitioner's
own
brief
says
at
their
conditions
of
incarcerations
differ
from
those
afforded
to
the
convicted
felons
at
the
menard
penitentiary.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
yes,
there
is
such
a
requirement,
justice--
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
--no,
i
don't
believe
he
has
been
convicted
of
a
felony
even
in
an
equivalent
sense.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
yes,
it
has,
justice
white.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
i
believe
it
would
have
been,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
would
have
been
because
you
had
the
victim
stating
that
on
a
day
certain
a
certain
act
occurred
forcibly
and
against
her
will
in
the
county
of
peoria,
and
i
think
this
brings
an
interesting
point
to
bear.
if
that
particular
finding
or
showing
were
made
by
the
prosecutor
in
a
criminal
prosecution,
he
would
have
the
adequate
evidence
for
conviction
of
a
felony,
but
he
wouldn't
have
adequate
evidence
for
a
finding
that
the
person
is
sexually
dangerous.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
the
sexually
dangerous
person
proceeding
requires
more
information,
and
as
the
illinois...
i
am
sorry.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
there
has
to
be
a
showing
that
the
propensity--
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
--correct.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
correct,
and
i
think
that
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
effort
put
into
the
idea
that
that
element
of
the
sexually
dangerous
persons
finding
makes
it
look
very
criminal,
and
i
think
that
that
is
a
very,
very
illusory
argument
when
you
consider
that
obviously--
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
--in
the
sense
i
would
concede
that
you
put
people
in
the
menard
psychiatric
center
only
after
they
have
demonstrated
that
they
are
going
to
create
problems
because
of
forcible
sexual
conduct
that
they
indulged
in.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
that
is
true.
there
are
psychiatric
problems
that
have
been
referred
from
within
other
institutions
of
the
department
of
corrections,
but
they
got
there
on
the
basis
of
a
felony
conviction.
i
think
it
is
important
to
understand
that
if
the
state
of
illinois
is
going
to
provide
treatment
for
the
sexually
dangerous
person,
treatment
for
those
who
commit
forcible
sex
offenses,
we
have
got
to
narrow
the
statute
in
some
reasonable
fashion.
we
have
narrowed
it
from
the
class
of
all
citizens
in
illinois,
narrowed
it
further
than
the
class
of
all
citizens
in
illinois
to
the
mentally...
mental
problems,
narrowed
it
further
than
those
with
mental
problems
of
a
psychosexual
nature,
and
narrowed
it
down
to
that
class
of
persons
with
psychosexual
disorders
who
are
going
to
act
out
on
those
disorders
against
others.
that
narrowing
process
is
what
the
statute
reflects
by
saying
that
it
will
be
an
underlying
criminal
prosecution
that
will
initiate
these
proceedings.
that
is
how
the
state's
attorney
in
an
individual
county
learns
that
the
person
may
well
be
sexually
dangerous.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
no,
it
is
not,
justice
o'connor,
and
i
think
that
is
another
factual
matter
that
needs--
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
--the
illinois
regulations
under
which
the
department...
the
illinois
regulations
that
the
department
of
corrections
had
imposed
on
the
menard
psychiatric
institute
quite
specifically
and
unambiguously
require
that
the
director
of
the
institute
every
six
months
will
evaluate
every
person
there
because
of
the
sexually
dangerous
persons
finding.
he
will
make
a
written
report
on
that
person.
he
will
submit
that
report
to
the
committing
court,
to
the
committing
county
attorney,
and
to
the
attorney
who
represented
that
person
as
a
respondent
in
the
sexually
dangerous
persons
proceeding.
every
six
months
this
person's
attorney
in
the
free
society
learns
of
that
person's
progress,
and
the
word
indefinite
as
applied
to
the
commitment
to
a
sexually
dangerous
persons
respondent,
it
may
be
a
semantic
difference
at
first,
but--
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
--it
differs--
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
--it
differs
in
factors
that
inure
to
the
benefit
of
the
respondent.
it
differs
because
he
has
got
the
right
to
appoint
a
counsel,
something
that
a
civil
committee
might
not
necessarily
have.
it
differs
in
that
he
has
to
be
proven
so
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
he
has
got
the
right
to
compulsory
process.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
justice
o'connor,
it
differs
in
the
sense
that
it
is
done...
it
doesn't
differ
in
the
sense
that
there
is
automatic
review.
that
is
available
to
the
judicial
and
civil
committee
and
to
the
sexually
dangerous
persons
respondent.
it
does
differ
in
that
a
person
committed
civilly,
under
the
civil
mental
health
code,
the
state
will
bear
the
burden
of
showing
by
a
preponderance
that
his
continued
confinement
is
justified.
in
the
sexually
dangerous
persons
act--
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
--that
is
correct.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
in
these
proceedings
the
respondent
files
his
petition,
and
he
bears
the
burden
of
proving
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
no,
i
do
not,
justice
o'connor,
for
the
reason
that
the
burden
that
the
respondent
shares
in
filing
such
a
recovery
application
has
to
be
evaluated
in
the
grasp
of
the
statute
which
requires
that
he
be
given
all
the
procedural
protections
that
we
have
discussed
already.
that
is
something
that
is
not
available
to
the
civil
committee,
who
may
be
at
his
own
in
dealing
with
the
department
of
mental
health
and
seeking
release.
here
we
have
someone
who
has
demonstrated
a
propensity
towards
highly
antisocial
conduct.
that
is
not
something
that
is
necessarily
true
of
a
civil
committee.
they
may
be
eccentric.
they
may
be
suffering
from
the
infirmities
of
age
or
some-other
form
of
retardation,
but
they
may
not
be
any
dancer.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
the
language
differs
significantly
in
that
at
some
future
time
there
may
be
some
potential
for
problem,
whereas
the
sexually
dangerous
person
statute
requires
that
there
has
been
a
demonstration
within
a
specific
time
period
in
the
recent
past,
and
i
do
have
a
significant
problem
with
the
use
of
the
word
"indefinite"
commitment.
i
concede
that
this
is
indeterminate
commitment.
i
don't
know
how
it
could
be
anything
other
than
indeterminate
commitment.
the
state
legislature
has
clearly
designed
this
statute
with
the
hope
and
the
goal
that
treatment
will
be
provided
for
those
with
psychosexual
disorders.
it
would
be
highly
artificial
for
the
legislature
to
say
that
an
individual
will
be
cured
within
a
given
period
of
time.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
terry
allen
need
net
spend
any
more
time
in
the
department
of
corrections
at
the
menard
psychiatric
institute
than
is
required
for
him
to
be
receiving
treatment
and
responding
favorably.
the
briefs
consistently
talk
about
the
requirement
that
terry
allen
be
cured.
that's
not
in
the
statute.
that's
not
an
element
for
his
release.
what
is
an
element
is
that
he
is
no
longer
dangerous
to
others
in
the
opinion
of
psychiatrists.
that
is
the
extent
of
the
state's
interest
insofar
as
others
in
society
are
concerned.
if
he
can
live
without
being
a
danger
to
others,
then
the
state
will
give
him
his
release,
and
if
there
are
doubts,
the
state
will
resolve
them
in
his
favor,
give
his
conditional
discharge,
let
him
live
in
a
free
and
unstructured
environment
and
prove
that
he's
no
longer
a
danger
to
others.
if
the
court
would
look
at
the
principal
factors
or
the
interests
of
society
that
we
think
we
foster
with
the
application
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
would
lock
to
see
whether
they
are
actually
fostered
in
the
context
of
a
sexually
dangerous
persons
act
proceeding,
i
believe
the
court
will
very
quickly
conclude
that
the
logical
underpinnings
of
the
fifth
amendment
itself
have
no
application
to
these
proceedings.
the
petitioner
identifies
as
one
of
the
most
serious
goals
that's
to
be
achieved
the
enhancement
of
accuracy
of
factfinding.
how
can
we
get
note
reliable
and
accurate
diagnoses
when
the
psychiatrist
isn't
sure
that
he's
going
to
get
responsive
answers
from
the
person
whom
he's
evaluating.
the
petitioner
says
that
we
want
to
be
free
of
coercive
techniques.
for
almost
30
years
the
state
of
illinois
has
allowed
coersion
in
the
taking
of
statements
to
be
brought
before
a
court
in
a
sexually
dangerous
persons
proceeding
and
resolved
pretrial.
there's
no
element
of
coersion
in
this
case.
terry
allen
has
never
said
that
he
was
the
subject
of
coercive
practice.
terry
allen
has
never
even
said
that
the
psychiatric
data
on
which
he
was
found
to
be
sexually
dangerous
was
less
than
accurate.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
there
is
compulsion,
but
as
minnesota
v.
murphy
teaches
us,
justice
rehnquist,
compulsion
isn't
coersion.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
there
is
compulsion.
now,
the
spectre
of
potential
abuse
of
the
statute
is
raised
in
one
of
the
briefs.
well,
that
just
doesn't
work
when
you
look
at
the
way
the
statute
works.
the
brief
says
what
if
we've
got
a
recalcitrant
witness.
the
prosecutor
will
use
this
method
to
get
rid
of
problem
cases
that
he
couldn't
prove
criminally
in
the
court.
well,
when
we
recall
that
the
problem
is
going
to
be
the
same,
he's
still
going
to
have
to
bring
in
some
proof
that
there
was
sexual
misconduct,
he's
still
got
to
bring
in
some
witness
to
testify,
as
christine
ray
did
in
this
case,
he's
not
going
to
get
around
recalcitrant
witnesses
by
going
to
a
statute
that
requires
more
proof
than
the
actual
criminal
felony
requires.
there's...
the
idea
is
put
forth
in
the
brief
that
people
under
91
1/2
in
illinois,
the
civil
commitment
procedure,
are
admonished,
but
the
point
of
the
matter
is
that
they
can
claim
their
proceeding
in
any
proceeding,
they
can
claim
their
privilege.
they
don't
have
counsel
appointed
to
them.
they
may
well
be
exposing
themselves
to
other
criminal
prosecutions.
that
doesn't
mean
that
they've
got
a
right
to
silence
in
the
civil
mental
health
treatment
context.
it
means
that
they've
got
the
right
to
claim
the
privilege
in
any
proceeding.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
he
had
the
right
at
all
times,
in
any
proceeding,
to
claim
a
privilege
if
he
thought--
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
--it's
not
the
statutory
law,
but
it
certainly
would
be
the
application
of
a
trial
court.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
it
is
the
law.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
that's
correct,
justice
marshall.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
no,
i
do
not,
where
he
is
immunized
from
criminal
prosecution.
the
fifth
amendment
certainly
protects
him
against
criminal
prosecutions
that
might
result
from
anything
he
said,
but
there
is
no
criminal
prosecution
at
issue
here.
if
the
state
wanted
a
criminal
prosecution
here,
it
could
have
proceeded
him
on
two
class
x
felonies
that
led
to--
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
--if
you
determine
that
this
is--
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
--a
criminal
prosecution,
i
can
see
that
he's--
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
--all
right.
if
the
court
feels
that--
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
--if
the
court
feels
that
this
is
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
criminal
prosecution,
then
certainly
the
fifth
amendment
applies.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
but
what
does
the
traditional
criminal
prosecution
want
to
accomplish?
the
two
traditional
aims,
according
to
this--
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
--that's
the
fifth
amendment.
the
criminal
prosecution
accomplishes
two
goals:
one,
retribution
or
punishment;
two,
deterrence.
the
illinois
legislature
could
not
have
had
either
of
those
goals
in
mind
when
it
enacted
this
statute,
because
if
you
are
talking
about
punishment,
the
numbers
in
the
briefs
reflect
that
this
person
was...
could
have
been
subjected
to
a
penalty
of
up
to
60
years
in
prison.
as
a
minimum,
he
was
going
to
get
six
years
in
prison.
the
american
psychiatric
association
reflects
that
the
average
mean
time
for
a
sexually
dangerous
persons
respondent
is
about
2.2
years.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
justice
marshall,
i'm
talking
about
the
imprisonment--
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
--on
a
conviction
for
felony.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
it's...
i
understand
that
that's
the
court's
opinion,
but
it's
not
the
same
facility,
and
it's
not
a
prison.
but
in
any
event,
the
punishment
aspect
can't
be
found
here.
if
the
state
of
illinois
wants
to
punish
terry
allen,
we
have
the
weaponry
to
use
in
a
criminal
prosecution
to
far
more
severely
sanction
him
for
his
conduct,
and
if
you're
talking
about
the
deterrent
effect,
if
you
look
at
dsm
3
or
any
psychiatric
manual,
you
will
find
that
the
psychosexually
disordered
are
impulsive
personalities,
and
the
idea
that
we're
going
to
deter
an
impulsive
sex
offender
is
inherently
illogical.
this
could
not
have
been
the
intent
of
the
legislature
of
illinois.
the
legislature
showed
its
intent
in
1955
when
they
amended
the
sexually
dangerous
persons
statute
and
they
said
that
if
you
proceed
as
a
county
prosecutor
against
a
person
as
a
sexually
dangerous
person
and
he
receives
treatment
from
the
psychiatrists
and
is
discharged
from
custody
as
a
sexually
dangerous
person,
you
may
not
proceed
on
the
underlying
indictment
against
him.
they
couldn't
have
been
more
clear
in
saying
that
the
sexually
dangerous
persons
statute
provides
a
treatment
alternative
to
criminal
prosecution.
if
we
want
to
punish
and
deter
people
like
terry
allen,
we
send
thousands
of
people
for
sex
offenses
to
the
prisons
every
year.
but
for
those
30
or
so
people
we
send
to
the
menard
psychiatric
institute
for
treatment,
we
have
the
right
to
provide
that
treatment
in
a
civil
context,
and
the
fact
that
we
erect
procedural
safeguards
around
that
civil
procedure
does
not
mean
that
it
shall
be
labeled
for
fifth
amendment
purposes
a
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
i
don't
believe
that
gault
is
a
particularly
helpful
case
in
this
context,
justice
o'connor,
for
the
reason
that
i
think
that
gault
involved
a
juvenile
statute,
and
the
language
of
the
court
involved
quite
clearly
indicates
that
it
considered
the
actual
effect
of
the
statute
involved
on
the
juvenile
to
be
indistinguishable
from
a
criminal
effect
that
a
person
would
suffer,
and
in
gault,
for
example,
it
was
noted
that
an
adult
convicted
of
the
same
offense
would
have
received
a
petty
fine
whereas
the
juvenile
was
subjected
to
incarceration
until
he
reached
the
age
of
majority
under
certain
circumstances.
so
the
court
was
concerned
that
the
apparent
intent
of
the
statute
was
to
punish
criminals,
and
i
think
that
gault
is
very
much
like
specht
and
some
of
the
cases
in
the
petitioner's
brief
where
a
conviction
is
obtained,
and
then
there
are
benignly
labeled
treatments
given
contingent
upon
conviction
as
alternatives
to
sentencing,
and
if
we
required
terry
allen
to
be
convicted
of
a
sex
offense
before
we
offered
this
treatment,
perhaps
the
issue
in
analysis
would
be
different.
but
i
think
here
the
fact
that
illinois
not
only
doesn't
proceed
on
the
criminal
prosecution
but
actually
quashes
the
underlying
charge
removes
this
from
the
ambit--
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
--we
have
to
find
that
at
one
point
within
the
past
year.
for
example
it
wasn't
necessary...
if
the
state's
attorney
got
a
police
report
that
victim
a
had
been
molested
by
the
defendant,
there's
nothing
that
requires
him
to
bring
in
victim
a
to
show
that
within
the
past
year
there
has
been
a
demonstration
of
a
sexual
propensity.
he
could
bring
in
any
person
who
would
give
testimony
that
within
the
past
year
there
had
been
a
sexual
forcible
misconduct.
so
there
isn't
this
unbreakable
link
between
the
underlying
criminal
charge
and
a
sexually
dangerous
persons
finding.
there
is
a
very
inextricable
and
unbreakable
link
between
sexual
forcible
misconduct
and
the
filing
of
the
petition
and
the
finding
of
the
petition.
if
the
court
analyzes
every
one
of
the
interests
of
the
fifth
amendment
that
are
identified
by
the
petitioner
as
those
which
will
be
promoted
by
application
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
then
in
a
very
logical
and
common
sense
fashion
applies
those
goals
and
those
ideals
to
the
actual
litigation
of
a
sexually
dangerous
persons
act
proceeding,
the
court
will
determine
that
you
have
taken
the
fifth
amendment
out
of
its
context
of
applicability
to
a
criminal
prosecution
and
thereby
undercut
the
efficacy
and
logic
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
deprived
the
state
of
illinois
of
an
opportunity
to
provide
humane
and
enlightened
treatment
for
people
with
psychosexually
impulsive
disorders.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
i
think
that
that's
highly
problematic
and
highly
unrealistic,
justice
blackmun.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
yes,
i
do,
because
first
of
all,
terry
allen
would
have
a
constitutional
right
to
get
psychiatric
examination,
but
where
would
the
state
be
able
to
rebut
his
expert
testimony?
we
would
fight
expert
testimony
with
lay
testimony,
and
do
you
think
that
the
witnesses
for
the
state
would
be
cross
examined
about
whether
they
were
experts?
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
in
front
of
a
jury
with
a
beyond-a-reasonable-doubt
standard
where
i'm
fighting
a
psychiatrist
with
a
lay
person,
now,
who
are
the
lay
people?
since
we
know
that
most
sexual
misconduct
is
furtive
in
nature,
we're
not
going
to
get
a
great
number
of
witnesses
to
these
events.
we're
going
to
get
people
with
obvious
biases,
yes,
he
victimized
me.
well,
your
bias
as
a
witness
against
him
is
pretty
patent.
yes,
he's
my
son.
your
bias
is
very
patent.
when
you
look
at
what
the
state
would
have
to
do,
the
prosecutor
would
be
well
within
his
discretion
to
say
if
i'm
going
to
go
through
all
of
that
trouble,
i'm
going
to
go
for
felony
conviction,
and
to
heck
with
sending
him
to
a
psychiatric
institute.
the
point
is
that
you've
placed
in
unnecessary
fashion
the
fifth
amendment
in
a
context
where
it
doesn't
apply
and
provided
a
disincentive
for
the
provision
for
treatment.
the
idea
that
we
can
use
circumstantial
evidence
to
prove
something
as
private
as
a
mental
disorder
is
very,
very
difficult
to
accept.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
well,
there
is
direct
evidence
of
the
psychiatrist
that
he
has
examined
the
individual
and
drawn
certain
conclusions.
we
couldn't
provide
such
direct
evidence
from
a
psychiatric
examination.
we
would
have
to
provide
secondary
resources:
because
he
did
this,
he
must
have
been
psychosexually
disordered.
but
justice
blackmun,
isn't
there
also
another
problem
that
the
jury
is
going
to
make
less
reliable
findings
when
it
doesn't
have
the
ability
to
evaluate
psychiatrists
from
both
sides?
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
well,
i
think
that
the
persons
who
suffer
here
are
the
respondents
to
sexually
dangerous
persons
proceedings.
it's
not
that
the
state
of
illinois
believes
that
it's
being
grievously
wounded
by
this.
it's
that
we
don't
think
we're
going
to
be
able
to
continue
on
what
we
thought
was
an
enlightened
path
under
these
circumstances.
we
believe
that
in
the
long
run,
respondents
are
less
likely
to
receive
treatment
and
more
likely
to
be
criminally
prosecuted
and
convicted
under
the
analysis
offered
by
my
opponent.
it's
not
a
matter
of
us
not
being
willing
to
extend
the
privilege.
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
if
the
court
is
familiar
with
the
cases,
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
has
been
so
solicitous
of
the
procedural
and
substantive
rights
of
the
sexually
dangerous
persons
respondent,
and
if
i've
indicated
to
the
court
that
we're
annoyed
by
the
application
for
privilege,
it's
not
my
intent
to
do
so.
but
we
fear
that
application
of
the
privilege
in
this
context
will
work
a
disservice
both
to
the
fifth
amendment
and
to
the
people
like
terry
allen.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
absolutely,
at
the
very
first
opportunity,
justice
stevens.
for
all
these
reasons,
i
urge
the
court
to
consider
the
illinois
sexually
dangerous
persons
act
to
be
civil,
as
does
the
general
assembly
which
drafted
and
enacted
it,
and
as
does
the
supreme
court
which
construed
it.
based
on
the
idea
that
it
is
a
civil
statute,
i
ask
the
court
to
follow
its
own
well-established
precedent
in
determining
that
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
is
not
available
in
such
a
context.
thank
you.
