justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
will
you
elaborate
a
little
bit
on
the
type
of
institution
in
which
these
persons
are
confined?
i
think
you
said
they
were
confined
also
with
people
convicted
of
crime.
is
it
a
state
prison?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
it
indistinguishable
from
other
prisons
that
do
not
have
psychiatric
cases?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
another
question?
i
still
don't
understand.
if
you
prevail
on
your
fifth
amendment
argument,
will
the
proceedings
that
you
think
this
court
should
approve
be
regarded
as
civil
or
criminal?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
are
you
still
contemplating
a
third
type
of
proceeding
where
the
party
involved
is
a
sexually
dangerous
person,
or
is
so
alleged?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
there
could
be
three
proceedings.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
one
is
criminal,
one
is
purely
civil,
and
the
other
is
sort
of
a
hybrid
one
in
between?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
this
question?
would
you
rather
have
terry
allen
tried
in
a
criminal
case?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
absolutely
not?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
oh,
you
would?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
that
because
you
think
he
would
not
have
been
convicted?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
this
because
of
the
facts
with
respect
to
allen
with
which
you
are
familiar
or
would
this
be
a
generalization?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
does
the
illinois
statute
require
in
terms
of
maximum
sentence
for
a
criminally
dangerous
person,
if
tried?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
would
still
rather
have
mr.
allen
run
that
risk?
