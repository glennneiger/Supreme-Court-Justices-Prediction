chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
allen
against
illinois.
mr.
meinz,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
a
criminal
procedure
or
a
civil
procedure?
you
cite
it
as
under
the
criminal
code.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
concede
the
legislature
has
described
this
as
a
civil
proceeding.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
illinois
provide
for
a
civil
commitment
that
might
be
brought
by
family
or
next
friend?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
if
the
family
became
aware
of
the
potentialities,
they,
the
family
might
proceed
independently
of
the
civil
action
and
ask
that
the
person
be
committed.
is
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
don't
have
that
issue
before
us
in
this
case,
however,
its
possible
use
in
a
truly
criminal
trial
at
some
future
date.
that
is
not
before
us
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
hasn't
illinois,
having
two
prongs
to
deal
with
this,
given
people
in
this
unfortunate
situation
an
opportunity
to
avoid
a
criminal
conviction
and
a
criminal
record
by
providing
a
civil
means
of
dealing
with
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
haven't
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
in
your
judgment,
but
they
have
two
statutes,
two
provisions.
one
is
civil,
and
one
is
criminal.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
underlying
civil
commitment.
but
this
is
a
civil
proceeding
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
that
makes
it
a
criminal
case
and
not
a
civil
case
because
of
the
means?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
our
case,
addington
against
texas,
that
was
seven
or
eight
years
ago,
was
that
a
civil
case
or
a
criminal
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
didn't
we
hold
there
that
there
could
be
an
enhanced,
a
greater
than
preponderance
of
the
evidence
without
altering
the
character
of
the
proceeding
as
a
civil
proceeding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
do
you...
you
have
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
now
arguing
that
because
of
the
nature
of
the
burden
of
proof
there,
that
that
makes
it
a
criminal
case,
but
addington
is
directly
contrary,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you
prevail
here,
is
it
reasonable
to
assume
that
the
state
will
proceed
against
him
on
a
criminal
charge?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
rotert.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
this
proof
on
this
record
be
sufficient
to
sustain
if
it
were
admissible,
if
all
the
proof
were
admissible,
to
sustain
a
conviction
under
the
criminal
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
you
have
four
minutes
remaining,
mr.
meinz.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
