justice
john
paul
stevens
refresh
my
recollection
about
the
sachulak
case.
that
case
did
not
hold,
did
it,
that
this
was
a
criminal
proceeding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
didn't
it
hold
that
the
consequences
or
the
stigma
in
the
punitive
consequences
were
severe
enough
to
justify
the
proof
beyond
reasonable
doubt
standard,
which
also
applied
in
the
criminal
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
one
other
question
about
the
institution?
justice
john
paul
stevens
menard,
as
i
understand
it,
part
of
menard
is
a
correctional
institution
in
the
punitive
sense
as
well
as
the
part
that
is
for
psychiatric
care.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
if
you
take
the
whole
unit,
how
many
inmates
altogether
are
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
asking
about
the
whole
unit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
what
i
was
asking.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
the
300
inmates,
persons,
patients,
whatever
we
call
them,
within
that
group
include
30
or
35
sexually
dangerous
persons
and
another
250
or
270
other
convicted
felons
who
need
psychiatric
treatment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
35
and
the
270
basically
are
all
in
the
same--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
you,
i
suppose
of
course
he
could
always
waive
the
privilege
if
he
wanted
to
to
avoid
that
particular
danger,
but
i
notice
the
statute
provides
that
he
has
a
right
to
counsel
at
the
proceeding.
if
he's
unable
to
pay
for
his
own
lawyer,
does
the
state
provide
him
a
lawyer?
