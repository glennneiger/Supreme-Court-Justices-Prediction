justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
a
hospital.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
person
confined
in
there
is
just
not
an
outpatient.
he
is
an
inpatient.
he
stays
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
the
persons
in
the
psychiatric
wing
or
whatever
the
building
is
segregated
completely
from
persons
in
the
criminal
part
of
the
structure?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
they
dine
together?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
the
psychiatric
people,
are
they
required
to
occupy
cells
at
night?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
are?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
long
as
he
is
not
cured,
he
won't
be
tried,
and
when
he
is
cured,
it
will
be
dismissed.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
he
will
be
there
until
his
death.
justice
byron
r.
white
like
in
a
civil
commitment.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
in
that
respect
it
is
the
same.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
in
a
civil
commitment.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
here
who
has
the
burden?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
often
can
he
raise
the
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
issue
here
is
the
fifth
amendment,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
since
whether
or
not
a
psychiatrist's
opinion
based
on
statements
that
he
is
making
from
the
respondent
is
admissible?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
statements
themselves
were
not
offered
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
objection
really
is
the
opinions
of
the
psychiatrist
based
on
his
statements.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
that
those
opinions
are
inadmissible
unless
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
he
had
to
have
a
lawyer
present
at
the
time
of
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--you
say
it
is
a
criminal
proceeding.
if
he
wants
a
lawyer,
shouldn't
have
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
not
for
jury
trial
later?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
are
you
claiming...
what
makes
the
fifth
amendment
so...
why
do
you
think
you
are
entitled
to
the
fifth
amendment
privilege,
but
not
the
jury
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
surely
the
fifth
amendment
can
be
claimed
in
a
civil
proceeding,
but
it
can't
if
it
isn't
incriminating,
and
these
statements
certainly
can't
be
used
in
any
criminal
case,
a
wholly
criminal
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
could
they
ever
be
used
in
a
criminal
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
could
they
ever
be
used
in
a
criminal
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
criminal
prosecution?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
be
inadmissible
then
as
having
been
compelled.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
saying
that
all
a
defendant
has
to
do
is
refuse
to
speak
to
the
psychiatrist
and
that
is
the
end
of
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
for
all
practical
purposes
the
state
may
not
compel
him
to
go
through
the
sexually
criminal
proceeding.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
else
are
they
going
to
determine
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
like
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
the
illinois
law,
must
he
speak
to
the
psychiatrist?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
law
say
so?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
he
refuses
to
speak,
is
he
subject
to
contempt?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
clear
from
the
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
think
compelled
testimony
like
that
would
be
very
difficult
to
get
into
a
later
purely
criminal
proceeding.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
is
wrong
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
haven't
insisted
on
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
this
case
has
dealt
with
it
as
a
civil
proceeding.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know.
i
know,
but
it
certainly,
even
though
independently
it
decided
on
a
reasonable
doubt
standard,
it
doesn't
believe
that
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
is
available
here
because
it
is
a
civil
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
part
of
this
special
proceeding,
must
not
there
be
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
the
sex
act
that
he
had
been
charged
with?
justice--
justice
byron
r.
white
--so
he
has
been
convicted
of
a
felony
in
the
sense
that...
not
by
a
jury
but
by
the
judge.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
has
it
been
proved
that
he
committed
the
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
of
course
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
nevertheless
has
produced
evidence
to
show
that
a
crime
has
been
committed?
justice
byron
r.
white
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
it
requires
a
lot
of
other
things.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
makes
him
much
more
like
the
other
felons
that
he
is
in
the
hospital
with.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
is
there
with
a
lot
of
other
people
who
have
psychiatric
problems
who
aren't
sexually
dangerous.
