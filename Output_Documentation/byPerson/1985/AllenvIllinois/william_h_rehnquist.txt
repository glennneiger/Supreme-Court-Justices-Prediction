mr.
meinz,
do
i
understand
from
your
response
that
justice
marshall's
question
about
the
burden
of
proof
that
the
source
of
the
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
burden
was
not
the
illinois
legislature
but
a
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
decision?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
said
you
had
immunity
though.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
use
immunity.
well,
that
is
not
enough?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
you
say
is
that
your
client
ought
to
have
the
same
sort
of
privilege
as
a
defendant
has
in
a
criminal
case,
and
he
can't
even
be
called
to
the
stand
against
his
will,
and
no
amount
of
immunity
would
do
him
any
good
unless
it
is
full
transactional
immunity.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
isn't
a
very
satisfactory
way,
is
it?
if
it
is
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
it
strikes
me
that
the
mental
condition
just
couldn't
be
established,
period.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
strong
is
your
argument
to
include
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
when
that
was
really
imposed
by
the
seventh
circuit?
they
just
took
a
view
similar
to
the
one
you
are
arguing
here,
that
this
proceeding
was
a
criminal
one,
but
that
doesn't
indicate
that
the
legislature
independently
would
have
come
to
that
conclusion.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
it
is
doubtful
it
would
have
done
that
without
the
seventh
circuit
constitutional--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--however
well
reasoned
it
may
have
been,
i
thought
you
were
arguing
that
here
illinois
has
incorporated
a
number
of
elements
into
this
type
of
case,
and
therefore
illinois
must
have
intended
it
to
be
a
criminal
case,
because
it
has
put
so
many
criminal
protections
into
it,
and
all
i
am
saying
is
that
it
seems
to
me
that
the
argument
about
reasonable
doubt
is
somewhat
different
because
that
really
didn't
start
with
the
illinois
legislature.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
of
course
his
claim
is
that
because
this
was
so
much
like
a
criminal
proceeding,
it
shouldn't
have
been
used
against
him
in
this
proceeding,
that
he
shouldn't
have
been
callable
for
any
purpose,
i
guess.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
there's
coersion
in
the
sense
that
you
say
he
may
be
required
to
testify
against
his
will,
and
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
has
said
so,
too,
hasn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
see
what
you
mean.
okay,
there
is
compulsion.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
they're
not
accorded
a
privilege
not
to
testify
at
all
in
that
civil
proceeding,
are
they?
