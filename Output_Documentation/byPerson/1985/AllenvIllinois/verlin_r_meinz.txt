mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
as
i
speak
to
the
court
this
morning,
the
petitioner,
terry
allen,
is
incarcerated
in
a
maximum
security
penal
institution
in
the
state
of
illinois.
he
is
there
with
persons
who
have
been
formally
convicted
of
crime,
and
like
them,
receives
the
mental
health
treatment
that
is
available
in
that
facility.
the
petitioner,
though,
has
not
faced
trial.
the
state
of
illinois
could
have
pursued
traditional
prosecution
against
him,
but
chose
not
to.
instead,
the
state
chose
an
alternative.
they
sought
to
have
him
declared
a
sexually
dangerous
person
under
article
105
of
the
illinois
code
of
criminal
procedure.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
it
is
under
the
criminal
code,
your
honor.
the
statute
itself
carries
a
civil
label.
we
are
arguing,
though,
that
it
is
criminal
for
purposes
of
the
fifth
amendment.
that
is
our
precise
argument
here.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
it
has
in
the
statute
itself.
the
state
pursued
this
adjudication
of
allen
as
a
sexually
dangerous
person.
it
conducted--
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
--that
is
the
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
state
must
make
its
case
that
allen
is
a
sexually
dangerous
person
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
that
was
the
thrust
of
the
decision
in
statulak
versus
coughlin,
a
seventh
circuit
case
in
1975:
which
ruled
that
the
proceeding,
though
denominated
civil,
was
sufficiently
criminal
as
to
require
the
imposition
of
a
burden
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
that
is
an
opinion,
by
the
way,
upon
which
we
rely.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
it
is
a
state
prison,
your
honor.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
it
is
indistinguishable
in
our
judgment,
your
honor,
from
other
institutions.
indeed,
it
is
simply
a
part
of
a
larger
institution,
the
menard
correctional
center
in
illinois.
in
1933,
the
menard
psychiatric
center
was
set
off
as
a
separate
institution.
a
new
wall
was
constructed
between
it
and
the
rest
of
the
minority
correctional
center.
mental
health
treatment
is
available
there.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
it
is
a
mental
health
treatment
center.
it
is
not
a
hospital
as
such.
it
is
certainly
not
a
mental
health
hospital,
as
one
might
imagine
a
hospital
to
be.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
he
stays
there.
he
stays
there
indefinitely,
your
honor.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
no,
they
are
not,
your
honor.
within
the
menard--
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
--yes,
they
do.
within
the
menard
psychiatric
center--
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
yes,
your
honor.
perhaps
i
should
clarify
this
just
a
bit.
menard
psychiatric
center
houses
about
300
some
inmates.
about
30
to
35
of
those
at
any
one
time
will
be
sexually
dangerous
persons,
persons
adjudicated
under
article
105
of
the
code
of
criminal
procedure
in
illinois.
the
remainder
of
the
population,
obviously,
the
majority
of
the
population
are
convicted
criminals,
convicted
felons
who
have
been
sent
to
the
menard
psychiatric
center
for
psychiatric
care.
there
are
convicted
sex
offenders
there
who
are
sent
to
the
center
for
the
sex
offender
treatment
program,
which
is
also
available
to
the
sexually
dangerous
person.
also
sent
to
the
menard
psychiatric
center
are
inmates
from
other
institutions,
also
convicted
felons,
who
have
been
found
to
be
in
need
of
short-term
psychiatric
care.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
yes,
your
honor.
originally
the
statute,
and
certainly
the
case
law
under
it,
specified
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
standard.
that
was
litigated
in
a
habeas
corpus
action,
and
in
1975
in
stachulak
versus
coughlin,
an
opinion
by
chief
judge
fairchild
at
that
time,
the
seventh
circuit
ruled
that
there
must
be
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
that
standard
must
be
applied.
after
that
decision,
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
people
versus
pembrock
also
ruled,
albeit
independently,
they
said,
that
there
was
a
reasonable
doubt
standard.
the
legislature
picked
up
the
cue
and
incorporated
a
reasonable
doubt
standard
in
that
legislation
in
its
revision
in
1981.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
mr.
allen
was
indicted.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
yes,
it
is,
and
it
will
be
until
such
time
as
mr.
allen
can
prove
that
he
has
recovered
from
the
sexually
dangerous
person
condition.
at
that
time,
and
only
at
that
time,
will
the
underlying
charge
against
him
be
dismissed.
but
it
isn't
likely
that
he
will
ever
be
tried
for
that
crime?
it
is
not
likely
that
he
will
ever
be
tried
for
the
crime,
a
crime
of
deviant
sexual
assault
and--
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
--that
is
true.
the
question
is,
and
one
significant
focus
of
our
argument
is
that
we
may
be
talking
about...
we
are
certainly
talking
about
an
indefinite
period
of
time
before
he
can
prove
that
he
has
recovered
and
before
that
charge
is
dismissed.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
he
may
never
be
able
to
prove
that
he
has
recovered.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
that
is
true.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
that
is
possible,
except
we
argue
there
are
very
real
distinctions.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
yes,
your
honor,
but
there
would
be
periodic
review
available
in
such
a
civil
mental
health
commitment
that
is
not
available
in
a
sexually
dangerous
person
commitment.
the
state
will
be
obliged
to
come
back
to
court
time
and
time
again
to
prove
that
the
commitment
to
a
secure
institution
is
the
least
restrictive
alternative
placement
that
is
appropriate
for
treatment.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
in
a
civil
commitment.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
the
defendant...
excuse
me,
the
accused.
he
is
called
the
respondent
in
the
proceeding.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
he
can
raise
the
question
as
often
as
he
wants
and
as
soon
as
he
wants
upon
being
committed
to
the
menard
psychiatric
center.
he
could
come
in
within
six
months.
he
could
come
in
in
a
year.
he
could
come
in
every
three
months
if
he
wanted
to.
importantly,
though,
at
that
time
he
has
the
burden
of
proving
his
entitlement
to
release.
he
must
show
that
he
is
entitled
to
release.
if
he
fails,
he
simply
goes
back
to
the
menard
psychiatric
center,
where
he
has
been.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
in
the
committing
court,
your
honor,
the
court
in
which
he
was
originally
found
to
be
a
sexually
dangerous
person,
and
that
court
must
make
the
decision
whether
or
not
the
respondent,
the
accused,
remains
a
sexually
dangerous
person.
if
i
could,
i
would
like
to
say
just
a
few
more
words
about
the
sexually
dangerous
person
process.
the
statutory
definition
i
should
get
to
first
of
all.
the
statute
defines
a
sexually
dangerous
person
as
a
person
who
has
a
mental
disorder
existing
for
a
year
or
more,
as
a
person
who
also
has
criminal
propensities
to
the
commission
of
sex
offenses,
and
a
person
who
has
demonstrated
those
propensities
towards
acts
of
sexual
assault
or
molestation.
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
this
case,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
gave
us
a
definitive
construction
of
the
third
element
of
that
definition.
the
court
said
that
as
to
the
third
element,
the
demonstrated
propensity,
the
state
must
show
that
respondent
has
committed
at
least
one
sexual
offense.
clearly,
then,
the
definition
involves
both
a
mental
condition
and
past
misconduct.
a
petition
to
have
a
person
adjudicated
a
sexually
dangerous
person
must
be
filed
in
a
criminal
case.
there
must
be
an
underlying
criminal
charge.
it
is
not
an
independent
process
in
any
way,
once
again,
unlike
the
civil
mental
health
process.
such
petition
seeking
sdp
adjudication
can
only
be
filed
by
the
prosecutor,
not
by
the
accused,
not
by
the
court,
not
by
a
friend
or
a
relative
on
the
accused's
behalf.
only
the
prosecutor
can
trigger
this
sdp
process.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
yes,
it
does,
as
does
every
other
treatment
program
that
i
am
aware
of,
your
honor,
in
the
state
of
illinois.
if
it
is
a
treatment
program,
if
it
is
a
mental
health
commitment,
in
illinois,
then
the
court
importantly,
or
any
friend
or
relative
on
behalf
of
the
accused,
or
the
accused
himself
can
petition
for
treatment.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
in
the
civil
area.
they
could
not
do
so,
however,
your
honor,
in
a
sexually
dangerous
person.
they
could
not
ask
to
have
someone
adjudicated
a
sexually
dangerous
person.
let's
assume,
for
example,
that
a
friend
or
relative
saw
the
accused
now
unfortunately
charged
with
his
third
or
fourth
sex
offense.
they
said,
well,
he
has
pled
guilty
before,
he
has
done
this
before,
he
did
a
short
stretch
in
prison.
we
need
treatment.
there
is
a
sexually
dangerous
persons
act.
let's
try
to
get
him
some
help.
they
can't
do
it.
only
the
prosecutor
can
make
the
decision
that
the
accused
should
be
adjudicated
or
treated
as
a
sexually
dangerous
person.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
yes,
it
is.
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
yes.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
only
part
of
the
statements
were
actually
admitted
into
evidence
at
the
formal
hearing.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
unless
he
is
informed
that
he
has
a
right
to
silence,
and
if
he
is
informed
of
the
consequences
of
his
speaking.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
no,
your
honor.
we
have
made
no
claim--
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
--our
claim
is
a
narrow
one.
our
claim
is
that
this
is
a
criminal
case
for
purposes
of
the
fifth
amendment
only.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
not
for
jury
trial.
we
are
claiming
no
entitlement
to
jury
trial.
by
statute
he
is
given
the
right
to
a
jury
trial.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
because
this
is
a
criminal
case
within
the
scope
of
the
fifth
amendment,
which
is
construed
more
broadly
than
the
criminal
case
provisions
of
the
sixth
amendment,
in
our
judgment.
we
make,
once
again,
no
claim
as
to
an
entitlement
to
a
jury
trial.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
we
believe
they
can,
your
honor.
our
first
point,
though,
is
that
he
should
not
have
been
compelled.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
after
the
sexually
dangerous
person
or
the
person
alleged
to
be
a
sexually
dangerous
person
had
spoken
to
a
psychiatrist,
and
was
compelled
to
speak
for
that
psychiatrist,
it
is
our
judgment
that
the
statements
could
thereafter
be
used
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
if
the
state
fails
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
a
person
is
a
sexually
dangerous
person,
we
believe
that
the
state
can
return
to
the
underlying
criminal
charge.
we
also
believe
that--
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
--but
the
state
of
illinois,
the
illinois
supreme
court
does
not
give
us
that.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
a
use
immunity,
your
honor.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
no,
your
honor.
it
is
not
even
equivalent
to
the
immunity
that
is
required
for
a
waiver
of
the
fifth
amendment.
it
is
not
coextensive
with
the
waiver
of
the
privilege.
we
need
a
derivative
use.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
illinois
we
have
as
a
general
matter
a
transactional
immunity.
we
are
not
given
transactional
immunity
here.
we
are
not
even
given
derivative
use
immunity,
which
is
our
most
important
point.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
we
are
insisting
that
he
not
be
called
to
the
stand,
which
under
our
judgment
is
also
possible,
given
the
ruling
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
that
he
has
no
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
in
our
judgment,
that
is
the
only
thing
keeping
him
off
the
stand.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
yes.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
no,
your
honor,
they
cannot
compel
him
to
speak
to
those
examples.
if
he
chooses
to
speak
to--
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
--they
have
a
great
many
other
ways
to
make
their
case,
your
honor.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
they
have
to
prove
once
again
a
mental
condition
and
past
misconduct.
how
is
past
misconduct
most
often
proved?
by
reference
to
prior
convictions
which
the
sexually
dangerous
person
act
specifically
contemplates,
the
introduction
of
other
crimes
evidence.
the
sexually
dangerous
persons
act
contemplates
the
introduction
of
lay
witnesses
who
have
been
the
victims
perhaps
of
past
sexual
assaults,
who
have
been
the
victims
of
the
persons--
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
--the
mental
condition
could
be
derived
from
psychiatric
observations
of
the
defendant,
of
the
respondent,
rather,
at
a
proceeding,
or
from
past
records,
prior
records
of
one
sort
or
another.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
your
honor,
my
experience
shows
that
indeed
the
state
can
and
has
proved
a
sexually
dangerous
person
without
regard,
without--
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
--where
the...
i
should
point
out
where
they
emphasize
where
the
state's
evidence
emphasizes
past
criminal
conduct
of
the
respondent,
and
where
the
state's
case
emphases
the
alleged
underlying
offense,
and
where
the
psychiatric
testimony
was
merely
a
by-product
was
merely
only
another
portion
of
the
evidence
that
was
introduced.
i
have
certainly
seen
that
type
of
case.
in
terms
of
the
difficulty
of
proving,
it
indeed
may
be
more
difficult
for
the
state
to
prove
that
an
individual
is
sexually
dangerous
if
the
person
within
that
proceeding
has
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
he
certainly
must.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
yes,
it
does,
the
law
and
the
case
law.
certainly
the
illinois
supreme
court--
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
--yes,
he
is.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
that
is
clear
from
the
law.
a
case
that
we
have
cited
in
brief,
people
versus
redlich,
is
in
fact
a
contempt
appeal,
an
appeal
from
a
contempt
proceeding--
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
--except,
your
honor,
we
read
the
illinois
supreme
court's
decision
for
what
it
is,
and
what
it
is
is
a
statement
that
the
person
enjoys
only
a
use
immunity,
and
no
more.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
i
don't
believe
it
is
coextensive
with
the
privilege
which
they
are
requesting
him
to
waive
under
kastigar
versus
the
united
states.
it
is
certainly
not
the
equivalent
of
the
transactional
immunity
which
he--
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
--not
transactional
immunity.
no,
your
honor.
derivative
immunity
you
have.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
that
is
not
before
the
court.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
we
wish
they
had,
your
honor.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
no,
they
haven't.
in
our
judgment
they
haven't.
they
have
certainly--
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
--three
provisions,
your
honor,
we
would
submit.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
it
is
announced
by
the
legislature
to
be
civil.
it
must
be
distinguished,
though,
from
the
civil
mental
health
process.
that
is
charter
91
and
a
half.
that
is
the
mental
health
code
in
illinois.
this
is
chapter
38,
the
criminal
code.
it
has
two
processes,
formal,
traditional
prosecution
and
the
sexually
dangerous
person
proceeding.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
no,
not
the
mere
placement
of
this
particular
piece
of
legislation
in
the
criminal
code
as
opposed
to
the
mental
health
code
or
elsewhere.
we
are
looking
at
everything
that
is
involved
here,
the
entire
process
from
the
fact
that
it
can
only
be
initiated
in
a
criminal
prosecution
to
the
point
that
it
can
only
be
initiated
by
the
prosecutor,
to
the
point
that
it
involves
a
formal
hearing,
rules
of
evidence,
and
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
involves--
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
--the
legislature
has
since...
well,
has
incorporated
it,
yes.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
and
the
illinois
supreme
court
had
done
so
as
well
without
regard
to
stachulak
versus
coughlin
on
the
grounds
that
they
recognized
that
there
were
very
serious
consequences.
i
should
point
out
that
stachulak
versus
coughlin
in
our
judgment
was
well
reasoned,
and
they
took
a
look,
the
court
in
that
case
took
a
look
at
decisions
of
this
case,
two
types
of
cases
from
this
court,
the
sexual
psychopath
legislation
cases--
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
--that
is
true,
your
honor.
we
are
arguing
that
without
regard
to
the
intent
of
the
legislature,
and
i
would
perhaps
concede
that
the
intent
of
the
legislature...
was
to
come
up
with
a
civil
proceeding.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
they
have
indeed,
and
that
is
our
complaint.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
and
we
disagree
strenuously
with
that
decision
on
the
grounds
of
the
sexual
psychopath
legislation
cases
and
on
the
grounds
particularly
of
in
re
gault.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
that
was
a
civil
case.
that
had
to
do
with
the
civil--
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
--yes.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
then
perhaps
i
have
misspoken,
and
especially
in
light
of
justice
rehnquist's
question.
perhaps
i
have
misspoken.
we
do
not
focus
particularly
strongly
at
all
on
the
fact
that
there
is
a
burden
here
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
we
focus
on
other
aspects
of
the
proceeding.
we
focus
particularly
on
the
commitment
that
is
involved
here,
a
commitment
that
is
vastly
different
from
the
commitment
that
was
involved
in
addington
versus
texas.
that
is
vastly
different
from
the
commitment
undergone
by
a
civil
mental
health
committee
under
the
mental
health
code
in
illinois.
they
don't
go
to
menard
psychiatric
center.
they
don't
go
to
a
maximum
security
penal
institution
like
sexually
dangerous
persons
do.
those
committees,
the
mental
health
committees,
unlike
the
sexually
dangerous
person,
has
his
situation
periodically
reviewed.
the
sdp
does
not.
the
state
has
a
burden,
a
repeated
burden
to
show
the
need
for
secure
commitment.
there
is
no
such
process
involved
here.
a
civil
committee,
one
who
is
in
a...
even
one
in
a
secure
institution,
has
a
bill
of
rights
under
illinois
law.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
i
think,
your
honor,
that--
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
--no,
we
believe
that
there
is
room
for
the
sexually
dangerous
person
proceeding
in
illinois.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
there
would
be,
in
our
view,
three
proceedings.
we
believe
that
proceeding
can
exist.
we
are
not
arguing
it
out
of
existence.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
yes,
but
we
would
argue
that
the
sexually
dangerous
person
proceeding,
while
it
lies
between
the
middle
of
the
traditional
criminal
prosecution
and
the
civil
mental
health
commitment,
is
skewed
to
one
side,
and
is
skewed
very
drastically
toward
the
criminal
side,
and
that
is
why
we
argue
that
the
proceeding
must
be
considered
so
far
criminal
in
nature
as
to
warrant
the
privilege,
the
application
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
and
we
urge
this
court
to
find
such
privilege.
if
it
does,
then
there
is
no
question
but
that
the
petitioner's
adjudication
and
commitment
as
a
sexually
dangerous
person
must
be
reversed.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
they
cannot
proceed
against
allen
on
a
criminal
charge,
though
they
might,
they
might.
if
this
case
is,
the
adjudication
is
reversed,
in
our
judgment
the
state
would
be
free
to
proceed
against
mr.
allen
in
a
formal
criminal
prosecution.
my
personal
guess
is,
they
wouldn't.
they
had
problems
with
their
proof
the
first
time
around.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
not
in
so
many
words,
your
honor.
it
just
viewed--
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
--yes,
your
honor.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
thank
you,
your
honor,
and
just
briefly,
the
state
argues
again
about
the
difficulty
of
proving
a
person
to
be
a
sexually
dangerous
person
if
the
respondent
in
that
proceeding
is
granted
a
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
they
do
have
a
burden
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
they
have
a
lesser
burden
in
a
civil
mental
health
proceeding,
and
yet,
an
individual
in
a
civil
mental
health
proceeding
in
illinois
is
accorded
a
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
and
the
state
in
fact
in
that
case
is
obliged
to
prove
its
case
by
its
own--
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
--they
are
accorded
a
privilege
that
the
examining
psychiatrist
must
inform
the
subject
of
the
privilege
to
remain
silent,
to
refuse
to
speak
to
that
examining
psychiatrist,
which
is
what
we
are
arguing
for
here.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
absolutely,
your
honor,
without
question.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
absolutely
i
would.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
i
don't...
yes.
i
can't
speak,
and
counsel
has
addressed
the
benevolence
hear.
they
hope
to
have
a
program
like
this
for
criminal
defendants.
i
speak
for
allen
more
so
than
i
do
for
other
criminal
defendants
in
illinois,
i
suppose,
but
i
know
i
wish
that
allen
had
been
prosecuted
criminally
as
opposed
to
adjudicated--
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
--because
he
would
not
have
been
convicted.
i
have
a
doubt
about
that.
i
also
think
he
would
have
been
out
by
now
if
he
had
been
prosecuted
criminally.
i
believe
he...
even
if
he
had
received
more
than
the
minimum
sentence,
he
would
have
a
better
chance
of
getting
out.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
this
would
be
a
generalization.
i
should
point
out
in
that
regard
that
the
2.2
year
statistic
that
was
cited
by
the
state
is
a
nationwide
statistic,
and
that
statistic
simply
does
not
reflect
the
average
length
of
commitment
of
a
sexually
dangerous
person
in
the
state
of
illinois.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
these
offenses
here...
and
we
can
assume
that
class
x
felonies
would
be
involved...
would
be
determinant
sentence
of
between
six
and
thirty
years,
barring
extreme
brutality
or
such
and
such
prior
record.
that
time
of
six
to
thirty
years
could
be
halved
by
day-for-day
good
time.
so
the
effective
minimum
here
would
be
three
years.
mr.
verlin
r.
meinz
absolutely,
your
honor.
he
would
have
had
a
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
he
could
have
forced
the
state
to
make
its
own
case.
he
didn't
have
that
opportunity
here.
thank
you,
your
honor.
