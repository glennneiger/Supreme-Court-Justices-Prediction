i
guess
there
also
could
be
state
law
defenses
to
a
counterclaim,
could
there
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
take
the
position
that
congress
can
routinely
give
agencies
pendant
or
ancillary
jurisdiction
over
state
law
claims
that
relate
in
some
way
to
the
adjudication
of
a
federal
statutory
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
may
i
inquire,
mr.
carson,
about
that
argument?
it
does
seem
to
me
that
consent
of
the
litigants
in
one
form
or
another
was
a
factor
relied
upon
by
this
court
in
thomas
versus
union
carbide.
and
i
think
that
it
also
has
been
a
factor
in
the
actions
of
courts
supporting
the
magistrates
act,
which
permits
a
magistrate
to
adjudicate
with
consent
of
the
parties
even
state
law
claims.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
in
the
thomas
case
the
form
of
consent
relied
upon
was
not
even
as
explicit
as
it
was
in
this
case,
was
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
was
just
consenting
to
submit
to
the
registration
scheme.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
the
circuit
in
which
you
were
acting
a
circuit
which
had
recognized
the
jurisdiction
over
counterclaims,
however?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
so
as
far
as
you
were
concerned
in
that
circuit
that
was
the
rule.
