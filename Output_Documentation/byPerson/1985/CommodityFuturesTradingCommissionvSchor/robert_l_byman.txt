mr.
robert
l.
byman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
if
it
may
please
the
court,
although
both
the
commission
and
conti
in
their
briefs
tried
to
craft
a
single
sentence
to
frame
the
issue
in
this
case,
there
really
are
three
basic
issued
presented
by
this
case:
number
one,
did
congress
intend
that
the
commission
have
jurisdiction
over
common
law
counterclaims;
number
two,
may
congress
provide
for
non-article
iii
dispute
resolution
where
the
parties
consent
to
such
resolutions;
and
number
three,
was
there
consent
here?
i
believe
that
the
deputy
solicitor
general
has
adequately
covered
the
ground
on
the
first
and
third
of
these
issues,
and
i
would
like
to
only
add
one
or
two
small
footnotes.
it
is
the
second
issue,
whether
or
not
congress
may
provide
for
non-article
iii
dispute
resolution
with
the
consent
of
the
parties,
which
i
think
is
the
real
meat
of
this
case,
and
which
i
would
like
to
address
most
of
my
remarks
to.
going
back
for
just
a
moment
to
the
first
issue
of
congress's
intent
in
this
case,
i
think
it
is
significant
to
point
out
that
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
congress
has
ratified
by
an
off
chance
remark
in
one
or
two
pages
out
of
thousands
of
pages
of
legislative
history.
rather,
in
the
1982
reauthorization
of
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission,
both
the
senate
and
the
house
used
identical
language
which
was
cited
in
all
of
the
briefs,
but
it
might
get
lost
in
the
fact
that
we
cited
only
one
set
of
language
because
we
didn't
want
to
cite
twice.
both
the
house
and
the
senate
said
that
the
reparations
program
seeks
to
pass
upon
the
entire
controversy,
including
counterclaims
which
arise
out
of
the
same
transaction.
it
is
also
significant
that
both
the
senate
and
the
house
versions
of
the
bill
were
reported
to
give
the
commission
broad
authority,
and
in
fact
the
house
report
talked
about
the
fact
that
the
house
wanted
to
exempt
the
commission
from
the
usual
application
of
the
administrative
procedures
act,
again,
to
give
it
broad
authority
in
this
case.
turning
quickly
to
the
third
issue
in
this
case,
whether
there
was
consent
here,
we
believe
that
this
is
a
relatively
easy
question.
schor
did
not
simply
consent
to
adjudication
by
a
non-article
iii
body.
he
demanded
it.
he
demanded
that
conti
dismiss
its
federal
action.
the
federal
judge
in
that
case
declined
to
accede
to
that
demand,
but
conti
voluntarily
dismissed
upon
schor's
representation.
he
only
raised
this
issue
after
the
administrative
law
judge
had
announced
his
preliminary
findings
and
directed
conti
to
prepare
a
proposed
order.
turning
then
to--
mr.
robert
l.
byman
--in
the
federal
sense,
your
honor?
mr.
robert
l.
byman
no,
justice
white.
in
the
commission,
conti
had
the
option
of
ignoring
reparations
or
its
counterclaim
and
going
directly
to
federal
court
or
filing
it
on
a
voluntary
basis,
but
obviously
the
goal
that
was
fostered
by
the--
mr.
robert
l.
byman
--absolutely.
mr.
robert
l.
byman
he
brings
a
reparations
action
to
seek
redress.
mr.
robert
l.
byman
exactly,
and
schor
knew
that.
at
the
time
that
he
filed
his
action
in
reparations,
the
seventh
circuit,
which
is
the
circuit
in
which
conti
had
filed
its
federal
action,
had
already
held
some
three
or
four
years
earlier
that
a
private
right
of
action
existed
under
the
commodity--
mr.
robert
l.
byman
--pardon
me?
mr.
robert
l.
byman
he
could
have
gone
to
voluntary
arbitration
if
the
parties
had
agreed.
mr.
robert
l.
byman
he
could
have
gone
to
state
court
at
that
time.
there
has
been
a
recent
amendment
to
the
commodity
exchange
act
that
creates
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
courts,
but
at
the
time
that
he
filed
his
claim--
mr.
robert
l.
byman
--that
is
right,
and
in
fact
he
was
in
court.
mr.
robert
l.
byman
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
byman
that
is
right.
he
still
has
his
choice
of
his
article
iii
remedy
or
his
congressionally
created
reparations
remedy,
but
if
he
chooses
the
reparations
remedy,
he
takes
as
the
arnett
case
called
it,
the
bitter
with
the
sweet.
he
takes
the
implications
of
the
procedure
that
he
has
decided
to
elect.
mr.
robert
l.
byman
well,
if
he
were
to
go
to
a
federal
court
now,
your
honor,
he
would
be
estopped
by
res
judicata,
since
he
is
litigating--
mr.
robert
l.
byman
--that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
byman
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
byman
there
could
be,
your
honor.
in
this
case,
this
contract
is
governed
by
illinois
law.
illinois
has
a
ten-year
statute
for
contract
claims.
i
would
like
to
turn
then
to
that
second
issue,
can
congress
permissibly
create
a
non-article
iii
remedy
with
the
consent
of
the
parties,
add
this
goes
to
the
question
that
justice
rehnquist
asked
the
deputy
solicitor
general.
in
fact,
it
is
the
issue
which
drove,
we
believe,
the
court
of
appeals
to
its
decision.
it
is
the
issue
which
drives
this
case,
and
that
is,
may
the
federal
government
allocate
its
resources
for
the
voluntary
application
of
a
non-article
iii
remedy
to
give
litigants
an
option.
i
would
like,
if
i
may,
your
honors,
to
pose
a
hypothetical.
we
know
from
the
southman
case,
we
know
from
the
pronouncements
of
various
members
of
this
court
that
this
court
favors
arbitration,
favors
the
parties
turning
to
alternate
dispute
resolution
foras.
if
congress
were
to
try
to
aid
that
arbitration
process
and
cure
one
of
the
evils
that
now
exist
in
arbitration,
this
case
poses
serious
risks
to
that
kind
of
a
remedy.
the
example
that
i
have
in
mind
is
under
triple
a
arbitration,
for
example.
that
forum,
the
american
arbitration
association,
is
a
very
effective
one
for
private
litigants
to
turn
to,
but
litigants
are
often
wary
of
it
because
of
the
unevenness
of
the
arbitration
panel.
some
arbitrators
are
lawyers.
some
arbitrators
are
associated
with
industry
and
have
no
legal
background.
some
arbitrators,
the
parties
simply
don't
know
who
they
are.
and
indeed,
when
the
triple
a
gives
lists
of
arbitrators
to
the
parties
that
have
proposed
arbitration,
the
parties
are
free
to
strike
all
of
the
names,
and
in
that
instance
the
triple
a
will
simply
appoint
someone
with
the
parties
having
no
input
whatsoever
as
to
the
panel
that
they
will
have
to
resolve
their
disputes.
congress
could
correct
that
problem
by
appointing
a
core
of
professional
full-time
qualified
federal
arbitrators
to
whom
the
parties
would
turn
only
on
a
voluntary
basis,
and
yet
if
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
upheld
in
this
case,
congress
could
not
do
that.
the
court
of
appeals
decision
would
tell
congress
that
it
could
not
use
federal
resources
to
help
the
citizens
of
this
country
resolve
their
disputes
even
though
the
citizens
wished
to
resolve
their
disputes
in
a
consensual
manner.
mr.
robert
l.
byman
the
mediation
service,
of
course,
doesn't
issue
binding
orders.
it
merely
aids
the
parties
in
forming
their
own
agreement
as
to
final
resolution,
so
it
is
a
slightly
different
situation.
there
also,
of
course,
are
labor
arbitrators,
but
that
deals
with
a
specialized
area
of
federal
law.
here
we
are
talking
about
state
law
concepts
where
the
parties
voluntarily
go
to
those
proceedings,
and
our
position,
your
honor,
is
that
the
parties
may
do
that,
that
congress
could
permissibly
create
a
federal
corps
of
arbitrators
to
hear
nothing
but
state
law
claims
so
long
as
the
parties
consented
to
go
that
forum.
that,
we
believe,
is
the
nub
of--
mr.
robert
l.
byman
--under
the
current
system,
your
honor?
mr.
robert
l.
byman
justice
brennan,
at
this
point,
the
judicial
review
is
that
after
the
commission
has
entered
a
binding
order,
an
appeal
may
be
taken
as
of
right
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
district...
for
the
circuit,
rather,
in
which
the
reparations
proceeding
was
held.
mr.
robert
l.
byman
the
same
standard,
your
honor,
and
it
is
a
standard
of
the
substantial
weight
of
the
evidence.
it
is
not
strictly
a
de
novo
review,
nor
is
it
a
clearly
erroneous
standard.
it
is
more
a
middle
standard.
mr.
robert
l.
byman
the
reparations
action
may
be
brought
in
any
location
in
which
either
the
broker
or
the
customer
are
located.
typically
reparations
will
be
filed
where
the
individual
customer
happens
to
reside.
in
this
case,
judge
painter,
who
was
sitting,
of
course,
in
washington,
asked
the
parties,
who
were
a
customer
who
resided
in
new
jersey
and
a
brokerage
firm
which
was
a
resident
of
chicago,
if
they
would
be
willing
to
come
to
washington
for
the
hearing.
they
both
agreed
to,
and
that
was
the
reason
that
the
d.c.
circuit
had
jurisdiction
of
the
appeal.
your
honors,
we
believe
that
it
is
incumbent
in
the
constitution
that
the
constitution
is
an
architecture
designed
to
protect
the
citizens
of
this
country.
it
is
not
an
architecture
in
and
of
itself,
but
rather,
it
is
designed
to
aid
the
legitimate
goals
of
people
who
reside
in
that
architecture.
we
are
aware
of
no
right
under
the
constitution
granted
to
its
citizens
which
cannot
be
waived
by
individuals.
this
is
exactly
that
type
of
situation.
if
there
was
a
article
iii
right
for
mr.
schor
in
this
case,
he
waived
it.
if
there
is
an
article
iii
right
of
litigants
to
have
their
disputes
heard
in
common
law
controversies
in
article
iii
courts,
they
waive
it
by
going
to
reparations.
we
believe
it
is
as
simple
as
that.
we
would
direct
your
honor's
attention
to
the
portion
in
our
brief
in
which
we
talk
about
the
fact
that
conti's
counterclaim
in
this
case
should
not
be
affected
no
matter
what
the
ultimate
resolution
of
the
broader
issue
is,
but
we
respectfully
suggest,
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
that
the
judgment
below
be
vacated.
