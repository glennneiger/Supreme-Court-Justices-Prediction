mr.
leslie
j.
carson,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
first
construction
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
with
respect
to
counterclaims
and
reparations
proceedings
was
by
the
cftc
and
took
place
when
it
was
promulgating
its
proposed
regulations
implementing
that
program.
it
construed
the
act
at
that
time
as
presenting
a
substantial
question
of
whether
it
had
any
authority
to
entertain
counterclaims
other
than
counterclaims
which
alleged
violations
of
the
commodity
exchange
act.
it
answered
that
substantial
question
by
promulgating
a
proposed
regulation
which
restricted
its
jurisdiction
over
counterclaims
to
counterclaims
which
alleged
violations
of
the
commodity
exchange
act.
it
did
so
based
upon
a
reading
of
the
act,
based
upon
a
reading
of
the
act
shortly
after
the
enacting
congress
had
passed
it,
and
it
did
so
with
express
recognition
that
the
counterclaim
regulation
that
it
was
proposing
was
a
counterclaim
category
which
would
be
indeed
very
narrow.
now,
to
be
sure,
thereafter
based
upon
comments
received
by
the
commission
from
the
industry,
which
basically
stated
that
brokers
commented
that
it
would
be
unfair
to
them
as
brokers,
the
commission
promulgated
the
counterclaim
regulation
which
brings
us
here
today,
but
it
is,
i
think,
important
to
note
that
on
the
statutory
construction
issue,
the
first
impression
of
the
commission
was
that
it
did
not
have
this
authority.
the
other
bases
of
construing
this
statute
which
were
referred
to
by
the
solicitor
general,
the
legislative
history,
i
just
want
to
point
out
that
the
legislative
history,
while
it
refers
to
counterclaims,
we
have
no
issue
with
respect
to
counterclaims,
it
does
not
refer
to
counterclaims
that
are
based
other
than
on
the
act.
the
act
itself,
section
14
of
the
commodity
exchange
act,
the
reparations
section,
refers
not
once
but
three
times
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commodity
exchange...
or
to
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
as
to
award
reparations
based
upon
violations
of
the
act.
no
other
authority
is
conferred
by
that
section.
the
section
has
been
amended
in
1983,
but
still
it
does
not
state
anything
with
respect
to
non-act
counterclaims.
indeed,
the
legislative
history
to
which
mr.
byman
referred
likewise
makes
no
reference
nor
explicit
reference
to
non-act
counterclaims,
so
that
on
the
basis
of
statutory
construction,
when,
of
course,
the
commission
locked
at
this,
they
looked
at
it
without
any
reference
to
any
constitutional
issues.
now,
of
course,
a
constitutional
issue
has
been
raised,
and
based
upon
the
fact
that
a
fair
reading,
a
reading
the
commission
itself
made
initially
would
permit
avoidance
of
that
constitutional
issue;
therefore
the
act
should
be
construed
as
not
raising
the
issue,
as
limiting
the
commission
to
the
jurisdiction
it
said
it
had
initially,
that
is,
counterclaims
based
on
act
violations.
however,
if
the
court
feels
it
must
reach
the
constitutional
issue,
the
issue
has
been
stated
by
counsel
for
conticommodity
services
as
indicating
or
as
being
whether
or
not
congress
may
create
a
program
in
which
state
law
created
rights
are
adjudicated
by
a
federal
tribunal
with
the
consent
of
the
parties.
we
submit
as
to
the
latter
factor,
consent
of
the
parties,
consent
is
irrelevant.
there
is,
of
course,
an
enormous
and
consistent
body
of
law
that
says
consent
of
the
litigants
cannot
vary
or
expand
the
jurisdiction
of
a
tribunal,
certainly
cannot
vary
or
expand
the
jurisdiction
of
a
court,
a
constitutional
court
or
a
state
court,
and
there
is
no
reason
why
it
should
be
able
to
expand
the
jurisdiction
of
this
administrative
tribunal.
beyond
that,
of
course--
mr.
leslie
j.
carson,
jr.
--that
is
true,
justice
o'connor.
the
magistrates
act,
however,
presents
two
distinct
differences
from
what
we
have
here.
number
one,
the
magistrates
are
adjuncts,
employees,
if
you
will,
of
an
article
iii
court.
they
exist
within
the
court.
they
are
supervised
by
article
iii
judges
in
a
very
close
way.
they
are
appointed
by
article
iii
judges.
they
are,
it
may
be
stated,
beholden
not
to
the
congress
but
to
article
iii
judges.
moreover,
the
magistrates
act
provides
in
this
article
iii
context
for
express
consent,
express
consent
by
the
parties
litigant
to
the
use
of
the
magistrate,
who,
of
course,
is
not
appointed
under
article
iii.
thus
you
have
explicit
consent,
statutorily
authorized
consent.
mr.
leslie
j.
carson,
jr.
the
form
of
consent--
mr.
leslie
j.
carson,
jr.
--that...
while
it
was
not
explicit
in
the
sense
that
there
was
a
provision
in
the
statute
relative
to
consent,
the
statute
itself
called
for
individuals
to
accede
to
this
system
in
order
to
be
a
part
of
it.
also
in
thomas
i
believe
the
decision
was
rendered
by
arbitrators,
arbitrators
who
were
themselves,
if
i
recall
correctly,
not
appointed
by
congress
or
by
the
executive
branch,
so
that
there
you
may
not
even
have
a
judicial
power
situation,
but
be
that
as
it
may,
if
the
arbitrators
in
thomas
were
the
subject
of
consent,
thomas
itself
represents
not
a
state
created
right
of
action.
it
was
explicitly
rejected
by
this
court
that
a
state
law
created
right
was
being
adjudicated
there,
and
indeed
the
court
rejected
the
proposition
that
the
rights
being
adjudicated
there
were
any
replacement
of
a
state
law
created
action,
so
that
that
is
distinguished
from...
this
case
is
distinguishable
from
thomas
as
we,
i
think,
point
out
in
our
brief,
based
on
the
fact
that
it
is
a
state
law
created
right
of
action,
and
that
there
is
a
special
relationship
or
special
protection
for
state
law
created
rights
of
action
under
article
iii.
mr.
leslie
j.
carson,
jr.
well,
of
course,
the
objective
of
the
tenure
and
salary
protection
provisions
of
article
iii
was
to
render
the
judges
appointed
thereunder
as--
mr.
leslie
j.
carson,
jr.
--it
is,
i
believe,
certainly
a
fair
reading
of
article
iii,
in
fact,
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
is
to
be
exercised
by
judges
who
benefit
from
those
tenure
and
salary
protection
provisions.
mr.
leslie
j.
carson,
jr.
it
certainly
is.
the
separation
of
powers
and
other
concepts
which
relate
to
the
independence
of
federal
judges
conferred
by
article
iii
are,
of
course,
for
the
purpose
of
improving
the
performance
of
the
exercise
of
judicial
power.
obviously,
that
provision
of
the
framers
was
not
for
the
benefit
of
federal
judges.
it
was
for
the
benefit
of
the
quality
of
government,
particularly
of
judicial
administration,
that
the
new
nation
would
offer.
mr.
leslie
j.
carson,
jr.
absolutely,
justice
white.
that,
of
course,
was
the
means
to
better
judicial
administration
the
framers
selected.
mr.
leslie
j.
carson,
jr.
no,
i
do
not
agree
with
that,
justice
rehnquist.
the
right
of
the
parties
is
not,
i
submit,
a
significant
or
relevant
factor
when
it
comes
to
article
iii.
article
iii
with
respect
to
state
created
rights
of
action
is
a
jurisdictional
article.
it
determines
who
may
hear
certain
kinds
of
controversy,
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
mr.
leslie
j.
carson,
jr.
i
do,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
submit
that
an
individual
may
not
confer
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
by
consent
on
any
person
who
is
not
the
beneficiary
of
the
protections
under
article
iii.
in
other
words,
while
i
may
agree
to
appear
before
an
arbitrator
who
is
not
appointed
by
congress
or
the
executive
branch
and
not
paid
by
congress
or
the
executive
branch,
i
cannot
agree
to
appear
before
a
person
who
is
employed
by
the
federal
government
and
who
is
beholden
and
paid
by
the
federal
government,
and
have
that
person
exercise
in
my
controversy,
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states.
mr.
leslie
j.
carson,
jr.
what
does
he
lose
by
having
judge
painter...
what
he
loses
by
having
judge
painter
decide
his
case
is
that
his
personal
loss
is
perhaps
not
the
answer
to
your
question.
he
has,
of
course,
the
loss
of
the
independence
protection
features
of
article
iii
that
are
provided
in
article
iii
which
are
not
accorded
to
judge
painter
or
to
his
supervisors,
the
commissioners.
mr.
leslie
j.
carson,
jr.
that,
i
think,
justice
rehnquist,
goes
to
the
exact
point
that
we
are
making
here,
which
is
that
the
treatment
or
the
decision
by
federal
authorities
of
state
created
rights,
the
adjudication
of
those
rights
is
something
that
was
limited
by
the
framers
in
the
context
of
the
rather
significant
controversy
over
whether
such
authority
would
be
conferred
upon
the
federal
judiciary,
whether
it
could
decide
in
the
context
of
diversity,
the
narrow
context
of
diversity,
state
created
rights.
that
controversy,
we
submit,
was
overcome,
that
is,
that
opposition
was
overcome
in
the
context
of
the
independence
conferred
upon
the
federal
courts
by
article
iii.
obviously,
any
litigant
is
entitled
to
appear,
or
bring
his
controversy
to
a
state
court,
and
there,
of
course,
article
iii
does
not
apply,
but
the
part
of
the
benefit
of
article
iii
is
the
preservation
to
the
extent
of
its
limitations
on
the
exercise
of
the
federal
judicial
power
over
state
related
or
state
created
actions,
the
benefit
that
it
confers
upon
the
relationship
between
the
federal
government
and
the
states.
in
other
words,
in
addition
to
separation
of
powers
directly
conferred
upon
the
judges
by
article
iii,
it
also
indirectly
renders
those
judges
independent
in
their
decisions
with
respect
to
state
related
causes
of
action.
mr.
leslie
j.
carson,
jr.
independent
of
congress.
one
of
the
concerns
that
was
expressed
during
the
debates
was
the
power
of
the
legislature
and
its
threat
it
represented
to
the
power
of
the
states.
while
i
do
not
believe
the
debate
can
be
demonstrated
to
have
been
as
focused
as
it
is
here
today
during
the
drafting
of
the
constitution,
i
can
point
to
one
quotation
which
is
quoted
by
judge
friendly
in
the
article
that
is
cited
in
the
briefs
which...
in
which
an
anti-federalist
who
styled
himself
aggripa,
took
the
position
that...
asked
the
question
rhetorically,
by
what
rule
will
these
national
courts
decide
diversity
cases,
and
he
answered
his
own
question
by
stating,
by
its
own
rule
or
by
that
of
its
employer,
the
congress.
now,
the
implication
of
that
answer
is
that
of
course
the
relationship
that
the
congress
had
to
the
courts
as
employer
would
in
some
way
enable
the
congress
to
have
an
unwanted
influence
over
the
national
courts.
that
argument,
of
course,
would
be
and
presumably
was
overcome
by
pointing
out
to
aggripa
and
the
other
anti-federalists
that
there
could
be
no
such
influence
by
congress
because
these
judges
would
have
independence
by
virtue
of
their
salary
and
tenure
protection.
turning
just
to
consent,
which
seems
to
be
the
major
argument
of
the
petitioners,
the
consent
that
we
have
been
confronted
with
is,
of
course,
not
consent.
we
may
have
been...
we
may
not
be
in
fact
consistent
throughout
this
litigation,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
when
we
took
the
position
that
they
have
alluded
to
in
the
federal
court
in
chicago,
we
lost.
our
position
was
rejected,
and
when
we
then
were
confronted
with
the
counterclaim
in
the
reparations
proceeding
in
washington,
we
did
at
a
later
time
to
be
sure
raise
the
issue
of
statutory
construction.
that
issue
was
raised
before
the
administrative
law
judge,
who
commented
in
his
initial
decision
on
it
by
stating
it
was
a
neat
legal
point,
but
he
was
bound
by
agency
regulations
and
policies.
we
raised
it
also
in
our
petition
for
review
to
the
commission,
and
we
raised
it
again
in
the
court
of
appeals.
of
course,
it
was
the
court
of
appeals
who
raised
sua
sponte
the
constitutional
issue
at
the
appellate
level,
so
that
we
did
raise
this
issue
as
to
jurisdiction
in
a
statutory
construction
manner,
and
therefore
cannot
be
said
to
have
consented.
mr.
leslie
j.
carson,
jr.
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
as
i
have
said
before,
consent
is
not
relevant
to
the
decision
in
this
case,
we
submit,
but
in
addition
to
that
our
selection
was
made,
as
mr.
byman
mentioned,
prior
to
this
court's
decision
in
merrill
lynch
versus
curran,
and
in
that
case
that
was
the
first
case,
that
was
the
case
which
settled
the
issue
of
whether
there
was
a
private
cause
of
action
based
on
the
commodity
exchange
act
and
violations
thereof.
until
that
decision
was
made,
there
was
a
conflict
in
the
circuits
and
a
conflict
in
the
decisions.
the
lower
court
here
collects
some
of
those
cases.
basically,
though,
until
five
members
of
this
court
decided
there
was
a
private
cause
of
action,
that
was
an
issue
that
was
up
in
the
air,
and--
mr.
leslie
j.
carson,
jr.
--the
seventh
circuit
had.
mr.
leslie
j.
carson,
jr.
that
was
the
rule
in
the
circuit,
but
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
that
would
have
prevailed
by
the
conclusion
of
the
case
was
far
from
certain
because
there
was
obviously
a
conflict
in
the
circuits,
and
clearly
it
was
going
to
be
dealt
with
ultimately
by
this
court,
and
this
court
by
one
vote
upheld
a
private
right
of
action.
for
the
reasons
we
have
stated,
a,
the
statute
does
not
authorize
hearing
of
these
state
law
counterclaims,
and
because
article
iii
especially
protects
the
states
against
the
trial
of
state
law
issues
in
the
absence
of
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
specifically
authorizing
that
by
other
than
article
iii
judges,
and
because
consent
here
is
not
relevant
and
did
not
in
fact
take
place,
we
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
lower
court
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
