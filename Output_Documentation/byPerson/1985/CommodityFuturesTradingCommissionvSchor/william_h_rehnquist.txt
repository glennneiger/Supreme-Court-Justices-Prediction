justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
there
is
no
question
that
the
counterclaim
could
have
involved
a
disputed
legal
issue,
and
it
still
would
have
been
before
the
cftc.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
of
course,
a
state
issue
involving
utah
law...
what
court
of
appeals
would
that
come
before
on
review
of
the
cftc?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
wouldn't
necessarily
be
the
court
of
appeals
where
some
judges
from
that
state
might
be
sitting?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
except
if
the
parties
submit
their
dispute
to
an
arbitrator,
there
is
no
question
of
the
allocation
of
the
powers
of
the
federal
government
being
involved
at
all.
here
you
are
having
a
dispute
resolution
under
the
auspices
of
the
federal
government,
and
it
really
is
not
being
done
primarily
by
the
judicial
branch.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if...
in
the
old
habrins
case,
i
think
it
was,
where
this
court
said
that
judicial
officers
shouldn't
be
passing
and
validating
pension
claims
where
their
decisions
weren't
final,
would
it
have
made
any
difference
there
if
the
legislation
said,
you
don't
have
to
submit
it
to
the
justices,
but
if
you
want
to,
go
ahead?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
carson,
what
is
the
evil,
if
i
may
call
it
that,
which
our
article
iii
jurisprudence
cases
seem
to
be
directed?
perhaps
we
ought
to
know,
but
certainly
we
can
ask
you.

then
is
it
to
keep
federal
judges
employed
to
make
sure
that
all
conceivably
judicial
business
goes
to
federal
judges
and
not
somebody
else
in
the
federal
system.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
then
a
right
that
is
for
the
benefit
of
the
individuals
who
are
to
have
their
cases
decided
by
those
judges?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
insofar
as
it
is
a
right
of
the
parties,
it
certainly
could
be
waived
by
consent.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
does
mr.
schor
lose
by
having
judge
painter
as
opposed
to
perhaps
a
new
jersey
state
judge,
an
illinois
state
judge,
of
a
federal
judge
decide
his
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
it
is
the
state
law
element
of
the
case
that
is
so
important,
he
might
well
go
before
a
state
court
judge
who
didn't
have
any
great
amount
of
tenure
either.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
independent
of
whom?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
mr.
carson,
when
you
are
given
two
alternative
methods
of
proceeding
to
try
to
get
the
relief
that
you
want
one
by
the
commission
with
a
rule
providing
for
counterclaims,
and
another
going
to
federal
court
where
you
will
get
your
article
iii
judge,
you
choose
the
first
of
them.
certainly
there
is
a
lot
of
our
doctrine
that
would
say
you
consented.
