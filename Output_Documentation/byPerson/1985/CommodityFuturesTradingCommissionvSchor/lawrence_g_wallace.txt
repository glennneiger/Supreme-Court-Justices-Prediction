mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
respondent
is
claiming
a
right
to
an
article
iii
adjudication
in
a
situation
where
he
was
afforded
that
right
by
the
governing
statute,
but
elected
instead
to
use
an
administrative
remedy
provided
by
congress
as
a
convenient
alternative.
in
other
words,
it
amounts
to
something
of
a
claim
that
the
constitution
should
protect
him
against
himself
and
against
the
election
of
remedies
that
he
exercised.
the
1974
amendments
to
the
commodities
exchange
act
created
the
commodities
futures
trading
commission
and
directed
it
to
establish
a
reparations
procedure
for
administrative
adjudication
of
disputes
between
brokers
and
their
customers,
and
as
we
have
shown
in
our
brief,
more
than
8,000
such
disputes
which
otherwise
might
have
been
brought
in
the
federal
courts
have
been
disposed
of
through
this
administrative
remedy
since
it
went
into
effect.
from
the
outset,
the
implementing
regulations
provided
that
counterclaims
arising
out
of
the
same
transaction
could
be
asserted
in
the
course
of
the
administrative
remedy.
the
counterclaim
regulation
was
pursuant
to
the
very
broad
grant
of
authority
in
the
statute
for
the
commission
to
adopt
regulations
not
only
to
effectuate
the
provisions
of
the
act
but
also
to
accomplish
any
of
the
act's
purposes,
and
as
we
have
detailed
in
our
brief,
the
act
itself
referred
to
counterclaims.
the
enforcement
provision
of
the
act
obviously
contemplated
that
counterclaims
would
be
heard
by
the
commission
since
it
gave
a
right
of
enforcement
either
to
the
complainant
or
to
any
person
for
whose
benefit
the
commission's
order
was
made.
the
house
report
initially
referred
to
counterclaims
and
anticipated
that
they
would
be
entertained,
and
congress
has
subsequently
revisited
the
issue
in
amending
the
act,
and
has
quite
explicitly
ratified
the
counterclaim
practice
that
the
commission
had
developed.
all
of
that
is
set
forth
in
our
brief.
in
many
respects
the
present
case
is
a
model
case
demonstrating
the
reasons
for
the
administrative
reparations
procedure
and
for
the
commission's
counterclaim
rule.
the
respondent
here,
owing
a
sizable
debit
balance
to
his
broker,
brought
a
fraud
claim
before
the
cftc
against
the
broker
and
one
of
its
employees.
as
is
typical
in
such
cases,
the
fraud
claim
essentially
required
the
commission
to
use
its
expertise
in
evaluating
a
complex
set
of
facts
rather
than
to
resolve
any
purely
legal
issues,
and
perhaps
the
outstanding
utility
of
the
reparations
procedure
is
that
it
allows
the
facts
to
be
evaluated
by
this
expert
agency
that
understands
the
operation
of
the
commodities
markets
and
these
transactions.
the
counterclaim
arose
in
the
following
way.
before
the
broker
had
noticed
that
the
reparations
complaint
had
been
filed,
it
had
filed
a
diversity
action
in
the
federal
court
to
recover
the
debit
balance
owing
on
its
account,
and
the
respondent,
the
customer
filed
a
counterclaim
repeating
its
fraud
charges
to
that
action,
but
also
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
or
stay
the
court
action,
claiming
that
it
was
essentially
duplicative
of
the
administrative
remedy
that
it
had
asserted
before
the
commission,
and
the
motion
that
was
filed,
there
was
a
later
one
as
well,
but
the
more
telling
part
of
it
is
in
the
joint
appendix
on
page
13
in
the
initial
motion.
we
at
least
find
this
page
of
the
joint
appendix,
page
13,
the
most
telling
page
in
the
joint
appendix,
and
the
court
will
note
that
respondents'
motion,
recited
in
paragraph
3,
pursuant
to
the
rules
of
the
cftc,
the
plaintiff
in
the
federal
court
case
could
get
its
claim
decided
by
filing
a
counterclaim
before
the
commission,
and
in
paragraph
4,
that
the
reparations
proceedings
pending
before
the
commission
will
fully
and
completely
resolve
all
of
the
rights
between
the
parties
with
respect
to
the
transactions;
number
5,
that
therefore
the
federal
court
suit
is
merely
duplicative
of
the
administrative
proceeding
that
the
respondent
has
filed;
and
number
6,
which
is
our
exhibit
a
and
b,
the
reasons
why
the
counterclaim
rule
is
needed.
respondent
alleged
two
reasons
why
the
court
suit
would
undermine
the
viability
of
the
administrative
remedy.
one
was
that
under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
it
was
required
to
assert
the
same
claims
it
was
asserting
before
the
commission
as
a
counterclaim
to
the
court
suit,
because
it
arose
out
of
the
same
transaction,
therefore
the
whole
case
would
be
removed
into
the
federal
court
if
the
federal
court
suit
went
ahead,
and
the
other
one
was
that
in
any
event
it
would
be
required
at
great
cost
and
inconvenience
to
litigate
the
issues
before
two
different
forums,
and
then
the
final
sentence
of
paragraph
6,
which
reads
like
a
sentence
out
of
the
brief
we
have
filed,
"the
effect
therefore
would
be
to
emasculate
if
not
destroy
the
purposes
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
to
provide
an
efficient
and
relatively
inexpensive
forum
for
the
resolution
of
disputes
in
futures
trading.
"
now,
as
is
also
typical
in
these
cases,
the
counterclaim
involved
no
additional
factual
issue
other
than
the
question
whether
the
fraud
alleged
in
the
administrative
complaint
had
occurred.
the
arithmetic
of
the
debit
balance
on
the
account
was
undisputed,
and
the
counterclaim
involved
no
disputed
legal
issue.
it
was
simply
a
way
fully
to
resolve
the
dispute
over
the
contested
transactions
in
a
single
proceeding.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
it
is
a
rare
occurrence
for
there
to
be
a
disputed
issue
of
state
law.
if
there
is
one,
of
course,
the
commission
will
resolve
it,
and
the
commission's
orders
are
subject
to
de
novo
review
on
a
state
legal
issue
in
the
federal
court
of
appeals,
which
is,
of
course,
an
article
iii
court.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
would
be
the
appropriate
court
of
appeals,
and
i
am
not
sure
that
i
can
answer
the
question
without
reference
back
to
the
statute.
this
particular
one
wound
up
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
court
for--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it
would
not
necessarily
be
that.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
those
would
be
heard
by
the
commission.
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
have
argued
in
our
brief
that
even
in
the
absence
of
consent
of
the
parties,
congress
could
require
the
adjudication
of
the
complete
transaction
in
all
claims
between
the
parties
in
the
administrative
agency
with
authority
over
the
claim,
but
we
frankly
do
not
believe
that
question
need
be
reached
here,
because
the
consent
of
the
parties
was
so
evident.
the
respondent
chose
to
follow
the
administrative
remedy
knowing
that
the
rules
of
the
commission
provided
for
the
counterclaim
to
be
asserted
there,
and
indeed
he
succeeded
in
persuading
the
broker
to
dismiss
its
federal
court
suit
in
favor
of
asserting
the
counterclaim
before
the
agency,
which
is
the
course
that
respondent
preferred.
so
this
was
not
merely
a
case
in
which
the
respondent
had
a
right
to
be
in
an
article
iii
court
if
he
chose
to
be.
it
is
a
case
in
which
he
actually
was
in
an
article
iii
court
and
opted
out
of
that
court
in
favor
of
having
the
agency
adjudicate
the
rights
between
the
parties
with
respect
to
the
entire
transaction.
so,
we
think
that
the
consent
of
the
parties
is
really
controlling
in
this
case,
the
consent
to
an
agency
adjudication.
in
our
view,
this
is
not
a
difficult
case
on
the
consent
issue,
such
as
thomas
against
union
carbide
of
last
term
in
which
the
question
of
consent
was
to
be
inferred
from
the
participation
by
individuals
in
a
statutory
program
that
restricted
the
resolution
of
disputes
arising
under
that
program
to
a
non-article
iii
forum.
instead,
this
is
a
much
more
straightforward
case
of
election
of
remedies.
respondent
was
not
so
restricted.
and
in
our
view
the
case
is
no
different
for
article
iii
purposes
from
a
simple
agreement
by
parties
to
submit
their
dispute
to
an
arbitrator
rather
than
to
proceed
in
the
federal
courts.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
true.
for
the
convenience
of
persons
participating
in
the
commodities
market,
congress
has
exercised
its
article
i
powers
to
provide
an
expert
administrative
tribunal
which
can
serve
by
consent
to
resolve
their
disputes
pursuant
to
administrative
procedures
with
a
greater
scope
of
judicial
review
than
the
article
iii
courts
and
would
be
true
of
arbitrators
who
would
be
less
expert
in
the
field,
and
the
parties
have
the
option
of
going
to
an
article
iii
court
rather
than
utilizing
that
procedure.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
is
no
improper
use
of
article
iii
judges
or
courts
in
this
case.
the
scheme
here
fully
comports
with
the
purpose
of
article
iii
in
preserving
the
independence
of
the
federal
courts
and
their
role
as
the
ultimate
expositors
of
the
federal
law.
now,
in
this
court
respondent
has
presented
us
with
something
of
a
moving
target
by
arguing
principally
that
it
is
not
his
own
rights
but
states'
rights
that
are
offended
by
his
election
of
the
administrative
remedy.
the
argument,
it
first
must
be
said,
is
particularly
abstract
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
where
the
counterclaim
involved
no
additional
disputed
issue
of
fact,
no
issue
of
state
law
whatsoever,
and
arose
under
a
statutory
scheme
in
which
in
the
rare
instance
when
the
commission
might
decide
an
issue
of
state
law,
its
determination
would
be
subject
to
de
novo
review
in
an
article
iii
court,
as
we
have
discussed.
and
in
any
event,
we
regard
the
contention
as
misconceived.
under
our
federal
system,
rights
between
persons
are
often
governed
by
both
federal
and
state
law
in
various
combinations,
and
it
is
commonplace
and
consistent
with
and
serves
the
rule
of
law
for
federal
officials
of
all
kinds
and
agencies
as
well
as
article
i
courts
to
determine
applicable
state
law
to
the
best
of
their
ability
and
to
apply
it
in
the
course
of
doing
their
business,
just
as
state
officers,
agencies,
and
courts
should
apply
applicable
federal
law.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
commission
in
its
first
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
did
propose
a
counterclaim
rule
that
would
be
limited
to
claims
under
the
cea.
it
is
an
overstatement,
however,
to
say
that
there
was
anything
in
the
notice
that
interpreted
the
act
as
limiting
the
commission's
authority
in
that
regard.
it
did
state
that
there
was
a
substantial
question
whether
a
broader
counterclaim
rule
would
be
authorized.
the
comments,
it
is
fair
to
say,
in
looking
at
this
whole
history...
the
commission
at
that
time,
of
course,
was
inexperienced
with
the
administration
of
the
reparations
procedure.
the
comments
pointed
out
what
the
commission's
experience
has
later
borne
out,
that
the
great
bulk
of
counterclaims
that
would
have
to
be
heard
in
order
for
the
transaction
fully
to
be
resolved
would
be
counterclaims
against
customers
that
would
not
state
a
claim
under
the
cea
unless
the
customer
happened
to
be
registered
as
a
broker
as
well,
and
only
one
such
counterclaim
in
the
8,000
cases
that
the
commission
has
had
has
arisen
thus
far
that
the
commission
can
recall,
the
commission
staff
can
recall.
so,
the
comments
on
the
proposed
rule
persuaded
the
commission
that
the
scheme
just
would
not
work
without
a
broader
counterclaim
rule
that
would
dispose
of
the
entire
transaction.
now,
with
respect
to
the
election
of
remedies
in
this
case,
it
is
true
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out
that
mr.
schor
had
the
option
under
then
existing
seventh
circuit
precedent,
and
this
court
had
not
yet
precluded
this,
of
bringing
his
claim
in
federal
court.
beyond
that,
he
was
already
in
federal
court
with
his
claim
as
a
counterclaim
to
conti's
diversity
action
against
him
under
the
diversity
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
so
that
he
himself
prior
to
merrill
lynch
had
the
means
of
getting
his
claim.
his
counterclaim
was
the
equivalent
of
his
claim
before
the
commission,
so
he
himself
was
in
federal
court,
and
said
he
preferred
to
have
the
commission
resolve
the
matter.
now,
with
respect
to
the
question
that
has
been
asked
about
the
purposes
of
article
iii
and
whether
our
position
comports
with
those
purposes,
i
think
the
purposes
are
largely
to
be
divined
from
the
complaint
and
the
declaration
of
independence
that
the
english
king
had
subjected
the
courts
in
the
colonies
to
his
will.
it
was
largely
designed
to
assure
that
independent
tribunals
would
serve
as
the
ultimate
expositors
of
the
law,
of
federal
law
in
particular.
and
there
was
a
corresponding
benefit
to
litigants.
it
is
not
an
absolute
benefit.
litigants
have
not
been
upheld
in
claims
that
there
was
something
wrong
with
having
a
judge
on
a
recess
appointment
sit
in
their
case
rather
than
one
already
enjoying
life
tenure.
but
to
the
extent
that
there
is
a
protection
for
the
litigants,
the
court
has
always
recognized
that
that
aspect
of
article
iii
protection
can
be
waived
in
favor
of
what
the
litigant
finds
a
more
convenient
means
of
resolution,
and
of
course
article
i
courts
such
as
the
tax
court
exist.
the
power
to
decide
issues
of
state
law
resides
not
only
in
the
tax
court
in
the
many
specifications
we
have
mentioned,
but
the
internal
revenue
service
itself
can
resolve
a
question
of
state
law
in
assessing
a
deficiency,
and
the
litigant
can
acquiesce
in
that.
the
taxpayer
can
acquiesce
in
that
by
not
challenging
it
in
court.
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
having
a
federal
official
determine
a
state
law
issue.
