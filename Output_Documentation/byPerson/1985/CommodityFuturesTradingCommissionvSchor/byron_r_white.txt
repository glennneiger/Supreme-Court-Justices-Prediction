are
these
counterclaims
compulsory?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
if
someone
gets
sued
before
the
commission,
does
the
commission
say
there
should
be
a
counterclaim
if
there
is
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
certainly
it
is
permitted,
counterclaim
is
permitted.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
congress,
you
say,
intended
it,
so
anybody
who
sues,
a
plaintiff
who
sues
before
the
commission,
what
do
you
say,
he
brings
an
action,
or
what
does
he
do
before
the
commission?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right,
he
brings
a
reparation.
he
then
knows
that
he
may
face
a
counterclaim.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
schor
couldn't
go
any
place
else,
could
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
schor
couldn't
go
any
place
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
he
go
to
court
anywhere?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
any
event,
he
could
have
gone
to
court
somewhere.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
still
could
today
if...
i
mean,
any
person
in
his
position
could
now
go
to
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
would
have
to
go
to
federal
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
like
now,
if
he
goes
through
a
federal
court,
he
is
going
to
have
to
face
a
counterclaim.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
i
mean
an
ordinary
plaintiff.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
knows
that
he
may
face
a
state
law
counterclaim.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
byman,
no
one
thinks
that
the
federal
mediation
service
is
unconstitutional,
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
does
the
reparations
action
have
to
be
brought?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
maybe
it
was
to
ensure
the
litigants
that
the
judges
weren't
being
pushed
around
by
the
parties
or
by
politicians
operating
under
undue
influence.
