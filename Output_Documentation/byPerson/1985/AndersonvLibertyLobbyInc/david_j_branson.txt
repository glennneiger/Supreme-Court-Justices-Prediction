mr.
david
j.
branson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
requires
the
court
to
again
consider
the
proper
applications
of
the
standards
enunciated
21
years
ago
in
new
york
times
v.
sullivan.
in
that
case
this
courtl
held
that
a
jury
verdict
could
not
be
sustained
because
that
libeled
plaintiff
did
not
produce
clear
and
convincing
evidence
of
actual
malice.
in
time,
inc.
v.
pape,
this
court
applied
the
clear
and
convincing
standard
in
reviewing
a
defendant's
motion
for
a
directed
verdict
under
rule
50
of
th
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
and
in
bose
v.
consumers
union,
this
court
applied
the
clear
and
convincing
standard
in
reviewing...
in
a
de
novo
review
of
a
district
court
determination
under
rule
52
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
the
question
today
is
whether
the
trial
courts
must
apply
the
clear
and
convincing
standard
in
public
figure
libel
cases
on
a
defendant's
motion
for
summary
judgment
under
rule
56
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
the
petitioners
urge
this
court
to
hold
that
indeed
the
trial
courts
are
required
to
apply
the
clear
and
convincing
standard
on
a
defendant's
motion
for
summary
judgment
under
rule
56,
and
therefore
we
urge
this
court
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
below.
the
purpose
of
rule
56
has
been
often
stated.
it
is
to
pierce
the
pleadings
and
to
assess
the
proof
in
order
to
determine
whether
there
is
a
genuine
need
for
trial.
the
commentators
are
in
agreement
that
the
evidentiary
standard
for
both
motions
is
the
same.
they
agree
that
there
is
no
genuine
need
for
a
trial
if
it
is
clear
in
summary
judgment
that
the
trial
court
would
have
to
grant
a
directed
verdict
applying
the
proper
evidentiary
standard.
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
disagreed,
and
the
court
of
appeals
here
set
a
rule
that
permits
a
public
figure
libel
plaintiff
to
proceed
to
trial
and
indeed
to
complete
its
case
at
trial
even
though
it
cannot
on
summary
judgment
produce
clear
and
convincing
evidence
of
actual
malice.
and
the
court
of
appeals
gave
three
reasons
for
setting
this
rule,
and
i
would
like
to
discuss
each
one
seriatim.
the
first
reason
given
by
the
court
of
appeals
was
that
a
trial
court
should
not
engage
in
a
weighing
of
the
evidence
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
the
answer
to
that
reason
is
that
a
trial
court
need
not
do
that
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
and
indeed,
the
trial
court
performs
no
different
function
on
that
motion
than
the
trial
court
performs
in
evaluating
the
evidence
on
a
motion
for
a
directed
verdict,
and
since
it
is
clear
that
the
trial
court
must
apply
the
clear
and
convincing
standard
on
a
motion
for
a
directed
verdict,
there
is
no
reason
that
it
can't
equally
apply
it
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
mr.
david
j.
branson
the
evidence
is
all
in
the
record
that
the
plaintiff
wishes
to
put
before
the
court
at
that
time,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
that
leads
to
the
second
reason--
mr.
david
j.
branson
--that
is
correct.
and
that
is
the
reason
the
court
of
appeals
identified
as
its
second
reason
for
not
applying
the
clear
and
convincing
standard
on
summary
judgment.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
this
motion
is
really
at
a
threshold
in
the
litigation.
it's
the
beginning,
so
to
speak.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
it
would
be
unfair
to
make
a
plaintiff
marshal
all
of
its
evidence
at
that
state
of
the
litigation,
and
indeed
would
turn,
the
court
of
appeals
said,
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
into
a
time
consuming
and
expensive
process
if
plaintiffs
had
to
marshal
all
of
their
evidence
at
that
stage.
but
an
examination
of
the
facts
in
this
record
demonstrates
that's
not
the
case.
this
case
was
filed
in
september
1981.
at
the
first
status
conference
the
trial
judge
set
a
date
in
august
1982
as
the
cutoff
for
discovery.
the
plaintiffs,
respondents
here,
took
their
first
deposition
in
october
1981.
the
defendants
did
not
file
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
until
august
of
1982,
almost
a
year
after
the
first
deposition
was
taken.
in
the
interim,
the
respondents
had
served
document
demands
and
interrogatory
requests
which
were
duly
responded
to.
on
filing
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
by
the
defendants,
the
plaintiffs
moved
the
district
court
for
additional
time
to
respond.
they
asked
until
october
15,
1982
to
take
additional
discovery,
and
the
district
court
granted
that
motion
and
gave
the
respondent
until
october
15
to
complete
discovery,
and
indeed,
the
last
deposition
was
taken
by
the
respondents
on
october
14,
1982.
therefore,
we
were
not
at
a
threshold
stage
of
litigation.
disocvery
had
closed.
the
respondents
had
fully
utilized
the
federal
rules
of
discovery.
they
had
made
the
record
then
that
they
wished
to
make.
there
was
never
a
complaint
to
the
district
court
or
to
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
respondents
had
in
any
way
been
denied
an
opportunity
to
develop
the
record
further--
far
from
being
a
threshold,
we
had
completed
the
preparation
of
the
record,
and
indeed,
it
would
have
ben
within
the
discretion
of
the
district
court
had
it
denied
our
motion
for
summary
judgment,
to
have
ordered
the
parties
to
trial
immediately
without
any
further
discovery.
so
it
cannot
be
sound
policy
to
take
a
case
like
this,
or
indeed,
any
case,
and
tell
a
libel
plaintiff
or
any
plaintiff
that
they
are
entitled
to
go
cast
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
on
the
notion
that
we
are
just
at
a
midpoint
in
the
litigation
and
that
after
that
point
is
past,
they
will
develop
new
and
additional
evidence
that
might
support
their
case.
and
that
is
the
justification,
the
principal
justification
utilized
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
support
its
rule,
and
we
believe
it's
fundamentally
wrong,
both
on
this
record
and
as
a
matter
of
general
application.
the
third
reason
offered
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
support
its
view
was
that
it
recited
the
dicta
of
this
court
that
state
of
mind
does
not
readily
lend
itself
to
summary
disposition
in
any
kind
of
a
case.
our
response
to
that
is
threefold.
first,
this
court
has
never
accepted
from
rule
56
any
class
of
case.
second,
whether
or
not
state
of
mind
or
any
other
evidentiary
issue
might
present
itself
in
a
given
case
does
not
determine
the
standard
of
proof
that
any
plaintiff
must
meet
at
any
stage
of
the
litigation.
whether
the
standard
is
preponderance,
both
at
the
summary
judgment
stage
or
at
the
directed
verdict
stage,
the
burden
of
the
plaintiff
is
to
produce
that
sufficient
evidence
to
go
beyond
that
motion,
and
it
does
not
do
to
say
that,
well,
there
is
a
type
of
evidence
here
that
excuses
me
from
my
burden,
whatever
it
is,
in
this
kind
of
a
case.
and
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
essentially
said,
that
because
state
of
mind
is
at
issue
in
public
figure
libel
cases,
we
must
lower
the
standard
that
the
plaintiff
is
required
to
meet
on
a
directed
verdict
and
not
require
that
standard
to
be
met
at
summary
judgment,
but
that
by
definition
simply
ensures
that
cases
will
go
to
trial
on
which
the
district
court
must
grant
a
directed
verdict
when
the
plaintiff
has
completed
his
case,
and
that
is
wasteful
use
of
judicial
resources.
mr.
david
j.
branson
your
honor,
when
that
happens,
whether
it
happens
at
summary
judgment
or
whether
a
credibility
question
arises
at
trial,
in
the
plaintiff's
case,
the
duty
of
the
district
court
is
to
draw
the
inferences
in
favor
of
the
person
opposing
the
motion,
and
therefore
that
result
ought
to
be
the
same
on
either
motion.
mr.
david
j.
branson
absolutely,
if
there
is
a
specific
fact
in
dispute
at
either
state
of
the
proceeding,
then
the
plaintiff
is
entitled
to
go
past
those
motions
and
submit
the
case
to
the
jury
for
a
resolution
of
that
fact.
mr.
david
j.
branson
your
honor,
the--
mr.
david
j.
branson
--i
understand,
your
honor.
that
question
was
addressed
in
the
advisory
committee
notes
to
the
amendment
to
rule
56
in
1963.
mr.
david
j.
branson
the
advisory
committee
noted
that
the
third
circuit
had
adopted
that
rule.
mr.
david
j.
branson
the
third
circuit
had
allowed
plaintiffs
to
pass
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
on
some
evidence
and
good
faith
pleadings,
and
the
advisor
said
we
want
to
change
that
rule.
we
want
to
require
the
plaintiffs
to
produce
specific
facts
on
which
an
inference
can
be
drawn
that
they'd
prevail,
and
therefore
they
would
be
entitled
to
proceed.
mr.
david
j.
branson
so
a
libel
plaintiff
should
not
he
permitted,
as
any
other
plaintiff
should
not
be
permitted
to
proceed
past
summary
judgment
when
a
statement--
mr.
david
j.
branson
--the
court
of
appeals
did
not
say
that.
mr.
david
j.
branson
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
because
libel...
excuse
me,
because
summary
judgement
is
a
threshold
issue,
it's
unfair
to
make
plaintiffs
marshal
all
of
their
evidence
at
the
summary
judgment
stage--
mr.
david
j.
branson
--and
secondly,
it
said
that
because
state
of
mind
is
at
issue,
it's
inappropriate
to
apply
the
clear
and
convincing
standard
because
otherwise
we
would
have
summary
judgment
granted,
is
the
inference
that
you
draw
from
the
court
of
appeals'
reasoning
there.
mr.
david
j.
branson
no,
i
don't.
your
honor,
and
for
example,
if
we
take
the
issue
of
mr.
eringer,
and
i
think
it
is
appropriate
to
deal
with
that
question--
mr.
david
j.
branson
--there
are
six
allegations
of
the
nine
remaining
that
are
attributable
to
mr.
eringer
as
the
source,
one
of
which
is
11.
the
court
of
appeals
dealt
with
mr.
eringer
on
two
different
issues.
one
of
them
relates
to
the
procedural
question
that
i've
already
addressed,
the
threshold
issue,
and
the
other
dealt
with
the
substantive
question
of
actual
malice
and
the
evidence
in
the
record
of
actual
malice.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
mr.
eringer
is
not
in
the
united
states
and
therefore
is
not
available
for
deposition,
and
since
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
this
is
a
threshold
inquiry,
we
should
give
the
plaintiff
an
additional
opportunity
to
somehow
deal
with
mr.
eringer.
now,
of
course,
we
believe
that
that's
fundamentally
in
error.
the
federal
rules
of
discovery
do
not
stop
at
the
borders
of
the
united
states.
if
the
plaintiffs
had
wanted
to
depose
mr.
eringer,
there
was
a
procedure
to
do
it,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
he
is
resident
in
the
united
kingdom,
and
they
never
suggested
to
the
district
court
they
had
any
desire
to
depose
mr.
eringer.
so
the
threshold
reason
for
using
mr
eringer
as
a
reason
for
denying
summary
judgment
here
we
don't
believe
is
sufficient.
on
the
merits,
the
court
of
appeals
used
language
that
makes
it
clear
that
their
analysis
of
the
bermant
who
was
the
author
of
this
article,
and
eringer,
who
was
the
source
for
these
six
articles,
is
an
analysis
based
on
negligence.
indeed,
the
court
of
appeals
uses
the
words
"standard
of
care",
and
that
is
the
language
or
negligence.
the
court
of
appeals
says
that
mr.
bermant
did
not
lock
mr.
eringer
in
the
eye.
he
couldn't
therefore
have
reliably,
reasonably
assessed
his
credibility.
that's
the
language
of
negligence.
and
finally,
the
court
of
appeals
said
mr.
bermant
did
not
check
mr.
eringer's
sources
himself,
and
a
failure
to
investigate,
we
have
been
told
time
and
again
by
this
court
and
others,
is
the
language
of
negligence.
so
the
court
of
appeals
has
said
that
this
issue
must
go
to
a
jury
because
the
plaintiffs
have
put
in
facts,
specific
facts,
mr.
bermant
did
not
check
his
sources,
mr.
eringer's
sources,
that
give
raise
to
an
inference
only
of
negligence,
and
that's
constitutionally
insufficient
to
sustain
the
jury's
verdict.
but
it
is
admissible
evidence
on
the
question
of
actual
malice.
and
so
by
adopting
the
rationale
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
diminishing
the
standard
that
the
plaintiff
has
to
meet
on
summary
judgment,
the
plaintiff
now
has
some
evidence
that
is
admissible
on
the
question
of
actual
malice.
it's
not
sufficient,
and
this
court
would
have
to
find
on
a
bose
review,
if
a
judgment
was
entered
on
this
evidence,
that
it
was
not
constitutionally
sufficient,
and
therefore
reverse
the
judgment,
but
this
plaintiff
gets
to
go
to
trial
because
they
have
evidence
of
mere
negligence.
mr.
david
j.
branson
yes,
your
honor,
there
have,
and
we
readily
admit
that
there
are
state
court
decisions
from
the
state
supreme
courts
that
disagree
with
the
rule
we
are
stating.
there
are
indeed
federal
court
decisions,
one
that
i
know
in
a
libel
case,
in
the
westmoreland
v.
cbs
where
the
trial
court
in
new
york
stated
a
different
rule
than
we
are
arguing
here
today.
it
is
a
question
of
policy.
mr.
david
j.
branson
yes,
there
are,
your
honor.
the
court
of
appeals
notes
that
its
view
is
not
the
view
of
the
second
circuit,
and
so
there
is
a
conflict
on
this
question,
and
we
don't
suggest
that
this
court
has
ruled
on
it
either.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
a
matter
of
sound
judicial
policy
and
correct
application
of
rule
56,
it
is
right
to
say
that
libel
plaintiffs
must
produce
the
same
quantum
of
evidence
at
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
that
they
need
produced
to
get
to
a
jury.
mr.
david
j.
branson
we
have
suggested
in
our
brief,
your
honor,
this.
if
the
footnote
in
hutchinson,
which
of
course
has
been
repeated
by
this
court
in
calder,
suggests
that
there
is
a
rule
against
summary
judgment
in
public
figure
libel
cases
then
that
ought
to
be
reconsidered
in
the
bose,
light
of
the
bose
determination.
however,
we
believe
that
the
proper
reading
of
the
rule...
not
of
the
rule,
of
the
dicta
announced
in
the
hutchinson
footnote
is
that
it
calls
for
a
neutral
application
of
the
summary
rules,
and
indeed,
they
should
be
neutral.
and
we
can
make
that
point
in
two
ways.
first,
when
this
court
first
enunciated
that
dicta
in
poller
and
stated
that
state
of
mind
does
not
readily
lend
itself
to
summary
judgment,
many
of
the
lower
courts
began
to
state
that
there
was
a
rule
against
summary
judgment
in
antitrust
cases
where
state
of
mind
was
at
issue.
and
therefore
this
court
in
national...
first
national
bank
of
arizona
versus
cities
service,
set
the
record
clear
and
said
there
is
no
such
rule.
the
facts
of
each
particular
case,
the
court
said,
in
cities
service,
must
be
examined
so
that
we
can
determine
whether
a
trial
is
needed,
and
the
court
there
upheld
a
grant
of
summary
judgment
in
an
antitrust
conspiracy
case,
making
the
point
to
the
lower
courts
that
there
is
no
rule
against
granting
summary
judgment
in
the
right
case.
now,
before
the
hutchinson
footnote,
lower
courts
had
been
saying
there
is
a
rule
favoring
summary
judgment
in
public
figure
libel
cases,
and
we
believe
that
the
chief
justice
in
the
footnote
in
hutchinson
simply
corrected
that
view
by
stating
there
is
no
rule,
and
we
believe
that
what
the
court
said
in
cities
service
applies
to
this
kind
of
a
case
as
well.
each
case
must
be
dealt
with
on
its
own
facts,
and
where
a
libel
plaintiff
in
response
to
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
can
produce
specific
facts
on
which
an
inference
can
be
properly
drawn
that
there
is
clear
and
convincing
evidence
of
actual
malice,
they
are
entitled
to
go
past
the
motion
and
to
get
to
the--
mr.
david
j.
branson
--he's
not
entitled
to
disbelieve
a
witness
if
there's
no...
well,
in
the
bose
case,
court--
mr.
david
j.
branson
--it's
not...
it
is--
mr.
david
j.
branson
--what
the
court
is
permitted...
what
the
court
is
permitted
to
do
under
bose
is
to
accept
a
trial
court
determination
that
a
witness
is
not
credible
and
yet
notwithstanding
that
admission,
assess
the
record
and
determine
whether
there
is
competent
evidence
by
a
clear
and
convincing
standard
of
actual
malice
because
the
author
in
the
bose
case
was
deemed
by
that
trial
court
not
to
have
been
credible.
and
this
court
in
bose
said
we
understand
that,
and
we
take
that
point,
but
notwithstanding
that
finding,
there's
still
in
that
record--
mr.
david
j.
branson
--that
case
would
have
to
be
reviewed
under
bose
by
an
assessment
of
the
totality
of
the
evidence
to
determine
whether
there
were
sufficient
grounds
to
find
that
that
reporter
in
fact
entertained--
mr.
david
j.
branson
--well,
you
might
have
go
take--
mr.
david
j.
branson
--we
may
put
his
testimony
aside,
but
what
the
court
said
in
bose
was
that
that
doesn't
provide
a
basis
for
the
plaintiff
to
prevail.
the
plaintiff
must
have
evidence,
its
own
evidence,
that
there
is
sufficient
grounds
to
find
actual
malice
by
the
clear
and
convincing
standard,
and
i
submit
in
this
case,
for
example,
what
the
plaintiff
is
saying,
the
respondent
here
is
saying
to
you,
is
that
it
may
be
that
charles
bermant,
if
he
takes
the
witness
stand,
will
be
disbelieved,
but
that's
not
enough
on
which
one
can
get
past
the
motion
for
summary
judgment--
mr.
david
j.
branson
--absolutely.
mr.
david
j.
branson
that's
precisely
our
point.
we
agree
with
that
entirely.
what
we
say
is
that
on
this
record
there
is
no
specific
fact
on
which
a
reasonable
juror
could
draw
an
inference
that
there
was
actual
malice
by
the
clear
and
convincing
standard.
mr.
david
j.
branson
why
is
that?
mr.
david
j.
branson
i
agree.
i
misspoke.
i
thought
i
was
responding
to
a
question,
and
i
must
have
confused
the
two.
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
discussed
evidence,
we
accept
that
it
has
discussed
evidence,
the
relationship
of
bermant
to
eringer,
which
is
evidence
in
the
record
from
which
someone
could
draw
a
reasonable
inference
of
negligence,
and
what
the
court
of
appeals
is
saying,
that
that
evidence
is
sufficient
to
get
the
plaintiff
to
a
jury
in
the
hopes
that
somehow
at
trial
they
will
somehow
add
to
that
evidence
and
provide
clear
and
convincing
evidence
of
actual
malice.
so
i
don't
mean
to
say
that
the
only
thing
at
issue
here
is
the
credibility
of
the
reporter.
the
court
of
appeals
has
identified
some
evidence
which
would
be
admissible
on
the
question
of
actual
malice.
the
question
for
the
trial
court
in
these
cases,
when
that
happens,
is
whether
in
assessing
that
evidence
it
believes
that
it
reaches
the
clear
and
convincing
standard
of
constitutional
malice,
not
simply
negligence
that
we
have
here.
mr.
david
j.
branson
no,
i
don't
because
the
court
of
appeals
uses
the
language
that
a
reasonable
jury
could
find
actual
malice
on
the
following
facts,
and
then
it
discusses
eringer
in
the
manner
that
we
have
discussed
him.
they
have
not,
the
court
of
appeals
has
not
said
that
it
is
applying
the
standard
we
argue
for,
the
clear
and
convincing
standard.
had
he
done
that,
we
believe
that
he
would
have
had
to...
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
had
to
have
concluded
that
there
is
not
sufficient
evidence
to--
mr.
david
j.
branson
--well,
on
a...
well,
on
a
preponderance,
the
plaintiff
would
fail
as
well
because
even
on
a
preponderance,
evidence
of
negligence
is
not
evidence
of
actual
malice,
plain
and
simple.
mr.
david
j.
branson
it
should
be,
unless
you
adopt
the
view
that
if
the
plaintiff
puts
some
evidence
in
the
record
that
is
admissible
on
the
case,
he
puts
some
fact
in
dispute.
mr.
david
j.
branson
that's
the,
that's
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
david
j.
branson
well,
but
the
court
of
appeals
has
said
that
this
evidence
of
negligence
could
give
a
jury
grounds
for
finding
actual
malice.
i
disagree
with
that
assessment
of
the
evidence,
but
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
said.
i
disagree
because
i
believe
that
that
is
evidence
of
mere
negligence,
and
under
no
standard
is
evidence
of
mere
negligence
ever
sufficient
to
find
constitutional
malice.
but
it
is
admissible
evidence,
and
there
may
be
some
case,
the
courts
have
told
us,
when
the
evidence
of
negligence
is
so
overwhelming
that
it
somehow
transcends
into
the
subjective
standard
of
constitutional
malice.
so
the
court
of
appeals,
i
believe,
is
suggesting
that
there's
enough
evidence
of
negligence
in
this
case
to
make
that
transcendance,
and
i
disagree
with
that
assessment,
but
it
doesn't
mean
the
court
of
appeals
has
been
inconsistent
in
that
regard.
mr.
david
j.
branson
well,
your
honor,
we
believe
all
of
them
would,
and
that's
the
holding
of
the
district
court.
we
believe
the
district
court
made
the
proper
assessment
of
the
entire
record,
the
totality
of
the
evidence,
and
concluded
that
on
the
clear
and
convincing
standard
this
case
should
not
go
to
trial.
mr.
david
j.
branson
that
is
correct.
your
honor.
mr.
david
j.
branson
in
an
actual
malice
libel
case?
your
honor,
the
court
applied
the
clear
and
convincing
standard
in
time,
inc.
v.
pape,
which
came
to
this
court
from
a
directed
verdict
granted
on
the
defendant's
motion
by
the
trial
court,
a
reversal
by
the
seventh
circuit,
and
this
court
in
turn
reversed
saying
that
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
had
not
met
its
burden
of
producing
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
that
is
the
only
case
that
i
know
of
where
the
court
has
dealt
with
a
directed
verdict
case
in
a
public
figure
libel
case.
mr.
david
j.
branson
time,
inc.
v.
pape.
mr.
david
j.
branson
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
court
of
appeals
does
not
say
that
that
is
not
the
rule.
mr.
david
j.
branson
i'm
sorry,
i
said...
i
made
a
double
negative.
excuse
me.
yes,
the
court
of
appeals
agrees
that
at
the
directed
verdict
stage,
clear
and
convincing
evidence
has
to
be
produced.
it
is
only
at
the
summary
judgment
stage,
because
of
the
reasons
we've
articulated,
that
the
court
of
appeals
believed
that
the
plaintiff
should
be
freed
of
that
burden.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
am
going
to
reserve
some
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
i
would
like
then
to
conclude
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
mr.
david
j.
branson
we
believe
rule
56
has
a
clear
purpose,
and
the
purpose
is
to
end
litigation
that
should
not
proceed
to
trial.
it
is
a
valuable
tool
of
judicial
management,
and
it
is
intended
to
prevent
the
wastage
of
a
court's
time
and
of
the
litigants'
time.
and
this
case
illustrate's
the
validity
of
that
purpose.
our
motion
to
summary
judgment
before
the
district
court
was
based
on
a
record
that
is
before
you
in
this
volume
of
the
appendix.
we
briefed
the
question
between
the
parties
in
less
than
50
pages.
the
counsel
for
the
parties
appeared
before
the
district
court
for
less
than
one
hour
in
this
case.
we
therefore
consumed
less
than
one
hour
in
the
entire
proceeding
of
the
court's
public
time.
and
the
court
granted
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
which
gave
effect
to
rule
1,
a
speedy,
just
and
inexpensive
termination
of
this
case.
but
if
we
have
to
try
this
case
it
will
take
four
to
eight
weeks
because
we
will
not
only
have
to
examine
the
questions
of
actual
malice
that
have
been
developed
before
the
district
court
to
date,
we
will
have
to
deal
with
the
question
of
truth
and
falsity.
we
will
have
to
deal
with
the
question
of
defamation
itself.
we
will
have
to
deal
with
the
question
of
damages,
and
indeed,
we
have
been
sued
for
$22
million.
four
to
eight
weeks
of
trial
time,
of
the
district
court's
time
and
of
our
time
on
a
case
that
to
date
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
are
in
agreement,
the
trial
judge
will
have
to
grant
a
directed
verdict.
that
does
not
give
effect
to
rule
56.
thank
you.
mr.
david
j.
branson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
in
my
time
to
respond
to
two
questions,
one
from
mr.
justice
stevens.
he
asked,
does
it
make
a
difference
what
standard
we
apply
at
summary
judgment?
and
the
answer
is
twofold.
as
the
court
said
in
that
addington
v.
texas,
we
are
not
engaged
in
a
semantic
application
of
words
we
are
engaged
in
setting
values,
first
amendment
values
and
the
values
of
rule
56.
and
with
regard
to
this
case,
we
particularly
take
the
court
of
appeals
at
its
word.
had
they
applied
the
clear
and
convincing
standard,
we
believe
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
found
for
the
defendants
and
have
sustained
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
and
therefore
i
respond
next
to
mr.
justice
white's
question
who
suggested
that
the
proper
course,
should
you
apply
the
clear
and
convincing
standard,
is
to
remand
to
the
circuit
court
for
its
determination
of
the
record.
i
suggest
to
you
that
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court
demonstrates
that
you
have
yourself
made
those
determinations
in
these
cases,
with
one
exception,
and
that
exception
was
firestone,
and
that
case
was
remanded
for
this
reason.
the
firestone
case
had
been
tried
in
the
courts
in
florida
on
a
strict
liability
theory,
and
this
court
held
that
the
negligence
theory
announced
in
gertz
had
to
be
applied
to
that
case.
therefore,
the
plaintiffs
had
made
no
record
in
the
trial
court
on
negligence,
and
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
this
court
to
assess
the
record
in
that
case.
but
in
all
the
other
cases
where
the
record
has
been
complete,
this
court
has
made
the
assessment,
and
while
you
could
remand
it--
mr.
david
j.
branson
--you
normally,
your
honor,
have
had
a
record
made
according
to
the
right
standard--
mr.
david
j.
branson
--with
the
exception
of
new
york
times,
where
that
case
was
tried
on
the
strict
liability
theory,
and
you
applied
the
clear
and
convincing
standard,
the
actual
malice
standard,
and
you
made
the
assessment
and
did
not
send
that
case
back
to
alabama
for
a
trial
in
the
alabama
courts.
mr.
david
j.
branson
if
you
apply
the
clear
and
convincing
standard
to
summary
judgment,
i
will
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
we
rest.
thank
you.
