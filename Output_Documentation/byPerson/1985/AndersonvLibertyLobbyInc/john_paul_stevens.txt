mr.
lane,
am
i
correct
in,
as
i
listen
to
your
argument,
and
listening
to
your
opponent,
you
are
in
effect
saying
that
the
evidence
already
in
the
record
is
adequate
to
meet
the
clear
and
convincing
standard.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
is
saying
the
evidence
in
the
record
is
insufficient
to
meet
the
preponderance
standard.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
both
of
you
seem
to
say
it
really
doesn't
make
much
difference
what
standard
we
apply
if
we
look
at
the
correct
part
of
the
record.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
are
primarily
interested
in
this
case,
i
assume.
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
a
lot
of
other
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
must
confess
i
have
some,
some
difficulty
understanding
that
argument
because
i
think,
as
justice
rehnquist
pointed
out
earlier,
do
we
not
assume
for
purposes
of...
or
doesn't
the
trial
judge
in
evaluating
the
motion
assume
that
all
of
your
witnesses
are
telling
the
truth
and
draw
all
inferences
favorable
to
your
side
of
the
case
in
evaluating
the
testimony?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
how
can
credibility
held
you
any?
you
assume
they
are
totally
credible.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
doesn't
go
to
the
standard
of
proof.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
doesn't
go
to
the
question
of
standard
of
proof.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
let
me
ask
you
again,
do
you
contend
that
the
cross
examination
will
do
something
other
than
prove
that
the
witness
is
totally
a
complete
liar?
say
in
summary
judgment
you
just
say,
well,
assume
that
that
witness
is
a
liar,
what
more
can
cross
examination
bring
out?
are
you
saying
that
you
will
bring
out
affirmative
evidence
through
cross
examination?
justice
john
paul
stevens
my
question
is
directed
at
the
argument
that
there's
something
special
about
credibility
of
witnesses--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--as
a
reason
for
having
a
different
standard
of
proof
on
summary
judgment,
to
which
an
answer
is
made,
well,
what
difference
does
it
make?
you
assume
that
the
lawyer...
all
the
witnesses
on
one
side
are
telling
the
truth
and
all
the
others
are
lying--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
then
say
what's
left,
is
that
enough
to
raise
an
issue,
and
i
don't
understand
the
cross
examination
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
but
you
have
argued,
well,
you
didn't
have
an
opportunity
to
cross
examine
in
front
of
the
trier
of
fact,
and
i'm
saying,
well,
if
you
did
have
that
opportunity
you
could
perhaps
prove
that
the
witness
is
a
total
liar,
but
don't
you
assume
that
on
summary
judgment?
so
what
is
the
point
of
your
argument--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--about
needing
to
cross
examine.
that's
what
i--
