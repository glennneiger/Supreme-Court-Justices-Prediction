justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
credibility
questions
where
there's
just
a
straight
conflict
between
two
sets
of
affidavits
on
a
question
of
fact?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
means
it
goes
to
trial.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
can
the
libel
plaintiff
just
rely
on
his
complaint
to
establish
a...
he
asserts
a...
some...
he
attacks
the
particular
statements
and
says
they
are
false.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
defendant
comes
back
and
says
they
are
true.
or
he
says
i
thought
they
were
true.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
mm-hmm.
justice
byron
r.
white
well--
justice
byron
r.
white
--is
that
another
error...
is
that
another
way
you
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
it
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
there
are
any...
any
of
the
statements
that
the
court
of
appeals
said
should
go
to
trial,
that
any
of
them
involved
real
credibility
questions?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
allegation
11?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
in
libel
cases,
neither
a
judge
nor
a
jury
is
really
entitled
to
just
disbelieve
a
witness
if
there's
no
contrary
evidence:
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
is
that
right
or
not?
i
mean,
the
other
side
is,
i
take
it,
you
say
the
other
side
has
to
come
up
with
some
concrete
evidence--
justice
byron
r.
white
--before
the
witness
may
be
disbelieved.
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
defendant
gets
on
the
stand,
or
say
it's
a
reporter
gets
on
the
stand
and
says
i
just
didn't
know
that
that
was
false,
i
had
no
reason
to
believe...
and
the
judge
says
i...
writes
an
opinion
and
says
i
just
don't
believe
him,
or
the
jury
says
i
just
don't
believe
him,
and
yet
the
other
side
didn't
come
up
with
any
concrete
evidence.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
wouldn't...
but
you
would...
wouldn't
you
have
to
take
the
judge's
or
the
jury's
judgment
that
this
fellow
was
just
incredible?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
just
put
his
testimony
aside,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
the
court
of
appeals
agrees
with
you,
that
at
the
directed
verdict
stage
the
clear
and
convincing
standard
applies.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
says
it
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
arguing
that
no
matter
what
standard
that
you
apply
here
on
summary
judgment,
that
you
should
win?
is
that
your
argument
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
there's
an
actual
conflict
in
the
evidence,
you
don't
resolve
it
at
either
summary
judgment
or--
justice
byron
r.
white
--yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
suppose
you
could
just
disregard
a
defendant's
witness
that
you
didn't
believe,
and
if
you
believed
him,
you
might
hold
for
the
defendant,
if
you
didn't
you
wouldn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
couldn't
do
that
on
summary
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
court
of
appeals
seemed
to...
the
court
of
appeals
seemed
to
think
it
was
important
because
it
carefully
applied
only
the
non-clear
and
convincing
standard
in
reviewing
the
record.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
we
disagree,
if
we
disagree
with
you,
perhaps
we
ought
to
find
out
what
the
court
of
appeals
would
think.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
yes.
so
what
if
we
hold
it
was
wrong
on
that?
we
shouldn't,
we
shouldn't
review
these
nine
allegations,
should
we,
under
the
clear
and
convincing?
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
we
ask
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
know,
but
suppose
we
disagree
with
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
we
remand,
don't
we?
we
don't--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
we
have
normally
had
a
judgment
of
a
court
on
the
right
standard,
haven't
we?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
yes.
