justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
branson,
in
fraud
actions
brought
in
state
courts,
frequently
the
burden
of
proof
is
said
to
be
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
actions
to
set
aside
a
will,
that
sort
of
thing.
have
there
been
state
court
decisions
as
to
what
standard
applies
for
summary
judgment
in
these
cases?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
also,
don't
you,
that
the
court
ought
to
consider
the
statement
and
the
chief
justice's
opinion
in
hutchinson
v.
proxmire
in
the
light
of
the
bose
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
not
enough
under
any
standard.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean,
you
don't
have
to
go
to
a
clear
and
convincing
standard
to
say
that
failure...
disbelief
of
a
party
upon
whom
the
burden
of
proof
is
isn't
enough
to
support
the
burden
of
proof
of
the
other
side.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
court
of
appeals
does...
well,
but
your...
if
you're
relying
on
the
point
you
just
made,
you
should
be
able
to
make
your
case
without
the
clear
and
convincing
standard
on
review
of
summary
judgment.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
the
whole
thing
turns
on
whether
or
not
the
disbelief
of
a...
of
your
reporter
would
support
an
inference,
an
affirmative
inference
for
them,
that
fails
under
the
normal
summary
judgment
standard
as
well
as
the
clear
and
convincing
standard.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
agree
that
in
this
case,
do
you
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
there
was
enough
under
the
normal
standard
of
summary
judgment
to
support
its
ruling?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
how...
what
if
you're
wrong?
what
about
on
a
preponderance?
i
thought--
--yes,
the...
what--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--the
fact
that
the
court
of
appeals,
in
your
view,
relied
on
negligence,
is
insufficient
regardless
of
what
summary
judgment
standard
you
apply.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
but
that
isn't
correct
even
under
summary
judgment
rules
in
a
number
of
other
areas
of
the
law
that
don't
have
anything
to
do
with
clear
and
convincing.
you
can't
say
that
the
plaintiff
hasn't
produced
enough
yet
to
go
to
the
jury
but
he
might
by
the
time
we
come
to
trial.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
lane,
let
me
go
back
a
minute
to
where
you
responded
to
justice
white's
question.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the
presence
of
the
judge's
ability
to
judge
credibility
by
seeing
the
witness
personally
is
so
important
in
the
clear
and
convincing
test,
how
can
an
appellate
court
ever
say
that
there
was
not
clear
and
convincing
evidence
here
if
a
trial
court
has
found
otherwise.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
witnesses
aren't.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
what
hutchinson
v.
proxmire
was
talking
about
in
that
statement,
wasn't
it,
that--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--a
defendant
can't
just
come
in
with
a
long,
self-serving
statement
about
how
great
he
is
and
how
truthful
he
is
and
expect
that
to
stand
up
on
summary
judgment
if
there
is
contrary
evidence.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i
thought
you
said
there
was
a
first
amendment
right
to
have
it
tried
and
decided
by
a
jury.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
after
reading
this
record,
one
might
truthfully
say
a
chill
on
both
your
houses.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
you
say
has
some
virtue,
i
suppose,
to
say
a
particular
standard
should
be
applied
for
one
court
and
tell
another
court
to
apply
it
can
be
a
pretty
abstract
proposition.
it
may
be
better
to
have
the
court
which
is
deciding
which
standard
to
apply
to
say
what
it
means
by
applying
the
standard
to
the
facts
of
that
case.
