mr.
mark
lane
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,--
a
reading
of
the
petitioner's
brief
and
reply
brief
asserts
in
essence
that
the
respondents
called
for
the
abolition
of
all
summary
judgment
in
public
figure
libel
cases
because
of
considerations
mandated
by
new
york
times,
that
is,
the
question
of
the
mental
processes
of
the
author
and
the
defendant.
that
does
not
represent
our
position.
we
support
the
position
here
taken
by
the
court
of
appeals
which
did
grant...
did
agree
with
the
district
court
that
in
21
of
the
allegations
of
defamation
it
was
appropriate
to
grant
summary
judgment.
we
agree
with
that
conclusion.
we
also
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
in
the
nine
where
they
did...
where
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
agree
with
the
district
court,
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct.
all
summary
judgment
cases
and
libel
cases...
summary
judgment
motions
in
libel
cases
need
not
be
denied
because
of
questions
of
credibility.
for
example,
the
court
held
in
this
case,
the
district
court
held,
and
the
court
of
appeals
agreed,
that
there
were
some
allegations
which
were
basically
opinion,
which
is,
of
course,
protected.
they
held
that
there
were
reliable
sources.
they
held
that
some
material
had
been
previously
published
in
a
responsible
and
reputable
publication.
we
do
not
quarrel
with
any
of
those
findings.
but
when
we
come
to
that
which
is
left,
we
get
to
the
question
of
weighing
the
evidence
and
determining
the
credibility
of
witnesses.
for
example,
mr.
branson
has
discussed
many
of
the
reasons
given
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
holding
that
mr.
eringer
is
not
a
source
who
can
be
considered
reliable
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
except
mr.
branson
left
out
what
i
consider
to
be
the
single
most
important
argument
offered
by
the
court
of
appeals,
and
that
is
mr.
anderson,
the
publisher
of
the
defendant,
testified
at
the
deposition,
when
asked
if
mr.
eringer
was
reliable,
i
don't
know.
i
don't
care.
it
doesn't
matter
whether
he's
reliable
or
not;
he's
not
a
source.
but
he
turned
out
to
be
the
sole
and
exclusive
source
for
five
of
the
defamatory
statements.
so
that
it
seems
to
us
that
the
standard
mandated
by
new
york
times,
talking
thereafter,
in
its
progeny,
about
reckless
disregard,
are
spelled
out
by
the
defendant
stating
i
don't
care;
i
don't...
it
makes
no
difference
to
me
whether
he's
reliable,
and
then
relying
upon
him.
this
court
in
st.
amant
talked
about
the
apocryphal
telephone
call.
the
court
of
appeals
has
said
in
this
case
this
is
something
like
the
apocryphal
telephone
call
coming
into
being.
but
the
other
matters
are
even
stronger
in
terms,
i
believe,
in
terms
of
a
need
for
a
trial,
the
matters
which
mr.
branson
did
not
discuss,
for
example--
mr.
mark
lane
--that
is
true,
but
also
we
would
go
further
and
say
that
the
clear
and
convincing
standard
should
not
be
applied
here
at
this
level,
and
the
difference,
if
i
may
say,
your
honor,
between
a
directed
verdict
and
summary
judgment,
it's
not
the
amount
of
time
the
plaintiff
has
to
conduct
discovery,
it
is
the
difference
between
cross
examination
in
the
presence
of
the
person
or
the
trier
of
the
fact.
that
is
crucial.
as
wigmore
has
said,
and
as
this
court
has
quoted
with
approval,
the
greatest
engine
ever
discovered
for
the
determination
of
truth
is
cross
examination,
and
that
does
not
contemplate
cross
examination
in
a
desert,
but
cross
examination
before
the
trier
of
the
facts,
or
at
least
before
the
court
to
make
the
decision.
as
the
court
has
said
in
bose,
which
is
a
case
cited
by
the
petitioners
in
this
case,
the
court
has
said
in
bose
it
is
true
there
can
be
a
determination,
but
this
court
said
in
bose
that
is
because
the
entire
record
is
there,
no
discovery,
not
affidavits,
the
record
is
there,
and
the
demeanor
of
the
witnesses,
the
crucial
witnesses,
was
observed
by
the
court,
and
that
is
what
is
lacking
here,
no
matter
how
long
the
discovery
period
is.
mr.
mark
lane
or
directed
verdict.
mr.
mark
lane
yes,
that
is
our
position.
mr.
mark
lane
that
is
correct,
but
in
order
to
believe
or
not
believe,
you
must
hear,
you
must
see
him.
mr.
mark
lane
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
other
two
areas
where
the
court
said
there
is
defamation,
possible
defamation
which
should
be
determined
by
the
jury,
was
one
where
the
editor
of
the
publication
himself
testified
that
he
said
this
is
a...
he
said
to
mr.
anderson,
the
defendant,
this
is
a
terrible
article.
this
is
a
ridiculous
article.
this
article
should
not
be
published,
and
about
one
of
the
acts
of
defamation,
the
editor
of
the
defendant
publication
said
this
could
be
libelous.
mr.
mark
lane
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
lane
this
is
the
independent
review
mandated
by
new
york
times
v.
sullivan,
and
that
is
it
is
an
independent
review
based
upon
the
entire
record,
the
determination
by
the
jury,
the
determination
by
the
court.
the
entire
record
is
there
including
the
determination
of
the
trial
court.
mr.
mark
lane
that
is
correct,
but
at
least
the
appellate
court
has
the
advantage
of
the
view
of
the
jury
or/and
the
view
of
the
trial
court
in
reaching
its
conclusion,
something
totally
absent
here.
we
have
heard
that
this
is
a
two-stage,
a
two-trial
procedure.
first
we...
plaintiffs
must
try
the
case
before
the
judge,
convince
the
court,
but
what
do
we
have
to
convince
the
court
on?
we
have
to
convince
the
court,
according
to
this
theory,
as
not
only
what
is
in
the
mind
of
the
witness,
the
publisher,
the
author
of
the
defamation,
and
whether,
how
his
mind
was
affected
by
malice
or
lack
of
malice.
but
according
to
this
standard,
the
court
must
then
guess
as
to
what
the
jury,
not
yet
chosen,
would
guess
as
to
what
the
witness
who
has
never
been
seen,
but
more
than
that
is
that
the
whole
process...
it
is
not
a
two-trial
system,
it
is
a
no-trial
system
once
that
motion
for
summary
judgment
is
granted,
because
no
one
who
has
made
a
determination
has
seen
a
record,
and
no
one
has
seen
the
witness.
one
other
area
where
the
court
of
appeals
acted
and
said
the
matter
should
be
tried
was
in
reference
to...
and
this
is
slightly
complicated
but
i
think
extremely
important...
a
man
named
mr.
spear
and
a
man
named
mr.
trento,
while
working
for
jack
anderson
wrote,
and
it
was
published
in
true
magazine,
a
totally
defamatory
article
about
the
plaintiff
in
this
case.
the
plaintiff
filed
a
lawsuit
against
true
magazine
and
its
publisher,
fawcett,
named
spear
and
trento
as
well,
but
did
not
serve
them.
the
true
magazine,
fawcett
publishers,
then
settled
that
case
according
to
the
demands
of
the
plaintiff,
paying
them
a
substantial
sum
of
money,
and
publishing
an
entirely
compensatory
article.
subsequent
to
that,
mr.
spear
became
an
editor
of
the
defendant
publication,
the
investigator,
took
and
utilized
that
in
assisting
the
person
who
wrote
the
article,
mr.
bermant,
gave
him
the
exact
information
which
had
been
published
previously.
mr.
bermant
then
secured
a
copy
of
true
magazine
which
contained
such
defamation
that
true
itself
had
settled
the
case
to
the
favor
of
the
plaintiff,
and
republished
the
same
defamation
yet
again
in
the
investigator,
and
some
of
those
allegations
of
defamation,
previously
published
defamatory
material,
survived.
and
those
are
some
of
the
matters
the
court
of
appeals
said
should
be
tried.
this
is
in
essence,
i
believe,
a
classic
case.
of
course,
it
is
possible
to
conjure
up
with
a
fertile
imagination
a
case,
if
this
one
is
to
be
dismissed
on
summary
judgment,
it
is
possible
to
conjure
up
a
case,
i'm
sure,
which
would
be
stronger
than
this
one.
but
the
elements
here
are
very,
very
strong.
this
court
had
the
apocryphal
telephone
call
in
st.
amant.
here
we
have
the
real
person,
mr.
eringer,
never
even
seen
by
the
author
of
the
article,
about
whom
the
defendant
mr.
anderson
said
we
don't
care
about
his
reliability,
it
makes
no
difference
at
all,
and
mr.
eringer
was
never
asked
what's
the
basis
for
anything
that
you
said.
he
was
never
asked
that
question.
that
is
the
record.
in
addition
to
that,
we
have
the
testimony
of
the
editor--
mr.
mark
lane
--i
am
saying
that
that
is
true,
but
that
is
not--
mr.
mark
lane
--yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
mark
lane
i
think
it
is
very
important
not
just
in
this
case
but
for
other
cases
that
the
standard
that
be
applied
is
not
clear
and
convincing
at
this
stage,
at
the
summary
judgment
stage.
one
can
go--
mr.
mark
lane
--yes.
mr.
mark
lane
yes,
yes.
we
are
concerned
with
this
one.
mr.
mark
lane
that
is
correct,
but
the
court
did
not
distinguish
and
did
not
say
what
it
would
have
done
if
there
was
clear
and
convincing.
it
said
that
was
not
the
proper
standard.
mr.
mark
lane
well,
i
think
it's
clear
what
the
court
said.
i
think
it's
clear
that
the
court
said
that
the
clear
and
convincing
standard
should
not
be
applied.
mr.
mark
lane
no.
mr.
mark
lane
i
think
that
the
clear
and
convincing
standard
should
not
be
the
standard.
mr.
mark
lane
well--
mr.
mark
lane
--that's
correct--
the
reason
i,
if
i
may
say,
that
i
believe
the
clear
and
convincing
standard
should
not
be
applied
at
this
level
is
one
can
make
the
analogy
which
the
court
of
appeals
did
to
a
criminal
case
where
the
standard
of
probable
cause
is
sufficient
to
have
a
person
arrested,
have
him
deprived
of
liberty
for
days,
many
days
on
occasion,
and
yet
at
the
trial
level
it
is
there
that
the
standard
of
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
comes
into
play.
and
so
here,
at
the...
at
this
threshold
level,
absent
a
full
record,
absent
an
opportunity
for
the
plaintiff
witnesses
to
testify
and
for
the
trier
of
fact
to
judge
credibility
by
seeing
the
demeanor
of
the
witnesses,
prior
to
that
the
standard
cannot
be
clear
and
convincing.
mr.
mark
lane
the
trial
court
should.
mr.
mark
lane
the
trial
court
should
but
did
not
in
this
case,
your
honor.
the
trial
court
did
not--
mr.
mark
lane
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
mark
lane
no,
but
the
trial
court
did
not
do
that
in
this
case,
and
the
reason
the
trial
court
did
not
do
that
is
because
of
mr.
bermant,
on
behalf
of
the
defendants,
came
in
with
a
massive
self-serving
statement
which
we
have
seen
in
libel
cases,
and
that
is
the
allegation
of
i
am
pure,
i
am
pure
of
heart.
there
was
no
malice
at
all
in
my
heart,
and
here
is
this
long
document
which
had
many
citations
from
reputable
sources
and
never
mentioned,
for
example,
in
the
affidavit,
never
mentioned
spear
or
true
as
a
source,
never
mentioned
it,
but
the
appendix
which
was
attached
thereto,
when
analyzed,
reveals
that
true
was
the
exclusive
source
for
a
number
of
the
libels.
i
believe
the
court
read
this
long
affidavit.
there
were
citations
about
what
the
new
york
times
and
what
the
washington
post
and
others
had
said,
and
had
not
made
an
analysis
as
to
the
delineated
analysis
which
the
court
of
appeals
made
as
to
each
question.
mr.
mark
lane
yes.
mr.
mark
lane
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
bose
takes
that
further
when
bose
says
that
this
can
be
reviewed,
but
it
must
be
reviewed
after
the
record
has
been
established,
after
the
record,
which
is
a
record
of
cross
examination.
those
of
us
who
have
tried
cases,
all
of
us
know
that
there
is
a
substantial
difference
between
testimony
given
during
a
deposition
in
a
lawyer's
office,
cups
of
coffee,
people
smoking
cigarettes,
the
witness
being
flanked
by
his
attorneys,
objections
made,
instructions
not
to
answer
questions,
and
the
crucible
of
cross
examination
in
front
of
the
trier
of
fact.
that
is
where
the
record
is
made.
one
year
of
discovery,
ten
years
of
discovery
are
not
equal
to
15
minutes
in
the
witness
chair
before
the
trier
of
fact.
that
is
what
wigmore
teaches
us.
that
is
what
this
court
has
said
on
numerous
occasions.
and
what,
may
i
ask,
is--
mr.
mark
lane
--in
this
particular
case,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
standard,
any
standard
applied
would
have
prevented
the
court
from
having
dismissed
on
those
kind
of
questions.
mr.
mark
lane
yes.
mr.
mark
lane
but
the
court
should--
mr.
mark
lane
--if
the
court
is
asking
are
all
the
inferences
to
be
taken
to
favor
the
nonmoving
party,
yes,
of
course,
but
they
were
not
taken
in
this
case,
as
i
have
stated.
mr.
mark
lane
yes.
mr.
mark
lane
well,
we
are
drawing
the
distinction,
for
example,
between
summary
judgment
and
a
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
which
follows,
or
in
the
case
of
bose,
for
example,
which
follows
an
entire
record
being
made.
we
say,
as
you
said,
your
honor,
that
on
summary
judgment
the
test
should
be
that
all
inferences
favoring
the
nonmoving
party
should
be
taken.
they
were
not
taken
in
this
case.
on
the
other
side,
if
i
might
say,
we
hear
raised
the
question
of
the
chilling
effect
upon
the
news
media
if
they
are
forced
to
go
to
trial.
i
must
say
that
i
have
seen
enough
of
the
gigantic
conglomerates
which
are
in
the
business
of
publishing
information
about
sports,
entertainment
and
some
news,
enough
to
see
of
them
that
they
are
not
easily
chilled,
they
are
often
clothed
so
strongly
in
their
own
arrogance
that
they
could,
i
believe,
go
through
the
ice
age
without
having
their
body
temperature
lowered.
but
if
one
is
concerned
about
that
and
the
chilling
effect
hat
one
is
concerned
about
is
the
massive
verdicts,
yet,
on
the
other
hand,
is
the
first
amendment
right
of
the
plaintiff
to
speak
out
and
the
chilling
effect
upon
an
unpopular
dissenting
plaintiff
who
wishes
to
speak
out
and
who
wishes,
if
malice
is
utilized
in
attacking
and
destroying
his
reputation,
to
at
least
avail
himself
of
his
first
amendment
and
second
amendment
right
to
have
this
question
adjudicated
before
a
jury.
now--
question:
what
is
the
plaintiff's
first
amendment
right
to
have
this
issue
adjudicated
before
a
jury?
no,
the
first
amendment
right
is
to
speak
out,
offer
a
dissenting
view.
mr.
mark
lane
if
so,
i
misspoke,
your
honor.
what
i
meant
was
the
first
amendment
right
to
speak
out
and
the
seventh
amendment
right
to
have
the
case
tried,
and
the
chilling
effect
upon
dissenters,
in
this
case
the
plaintiff,
respondent,
is
in
fact
a
newspaper,
which
is
an
unusual
circumstance
perhaps,
but
the
chilling
effect
upon
this
plaintiff
as
a
publisher
or
upon
any
plaintiff
is
a
matter
which
should
also
to
be
of
concern,
and
the
way
to
handle
that,
i
believe--
mr.
mark
lane
--i
believe
that
the...
all
of
the
concerns,
the
legitimate
concerns
of
the
news
media
having
a
great
deal
of
room
within
which
to
make
error,
even
without
adequate
investigation,
all
of
those
concerns
have
been
addressed
by
new
york
times
and
all
the
progeny,
including
hutchinson
and
the
most
recent
case
bose,
but
i
think
that
those
concerns
can
be
addressed
by...
not
by
abrogating
the
ordinary
rules
regarding
summary
judgment,
but
by
after
trial,
after
the
full
record
has
been
made,
after
the
plaintiff
has
had
an
opportunity
to
vindicate
himself...
money
is
important
to
many
plaintiffs
when
they
bring
actions,
but
to
many
of
us,
to
many
of
those
who
are
not
plaintiffs,
and
even
to
some
plaintiffs,
the
right
to
vindicate
one's
position
is
of
great
consequence,
in
some
cases
of
greater
consequence.
if
the
plaintiff
can
have
his
position
vindicated,
if
the
concern
of
the
chilling
effect
upon
the
news
media
can
then
be
addressed,
i
suggest
by
a
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict,
where
something
can
be
done
about
any
damages,
excessive
or
otherwise,
which
have
been
awarded
by
the
jury;
in
that
fashion
the
chilling
effect
can
be
addressed,
if
there
is
one,
although
i
have
never
seen
this
apocryphal
chilling
effect
documented
over
the
years,
but
if
it
exists,
it
can
be
dealt
with
certainly
by
that
independent
review,
and
at
the
same
time,
the
first
amendment
rights
of
the
plaintiff
may
be
protected
by
permitting
him
to
speak
out
and
his
seventh
amendment
rights
protected
by
permitting
him
to
have
a
trial
before
the
jury.
the
case,
in
conclusions,
the
case
here
rests
upon
the
allegation
by
the
petitioners
that
my
client
is
not
entitled
to
try,
to
go
to
a
jury,
to
try
a
case
where
part
of
the
case
is
based
exclusively
upon
allegations
which
were
previously
published
and
found
to
be
defamatory,
and
then
republished.
part
of
the
case
which
exists
is
based
upon
the
allegation
by
the
editor
of
the
defendant
publication
that
this
publication,
this
caricature,
this
cartoon,
could
be
libelous
and
should
not
be
published,
and
they
published
it.
and
part
of
it
is
based
upon
the
look-alike
of
the
st.
amant
apocryphal
figure
come
to
life
with
the
defendant
having
stated
about
him,
we
don't
know
if
he's
reliable,
we
don't
care
if
he's
reliable,
it
does
not
matter.
that
is
reckless
disregard.
and
i
say
it
is
possible
to
conjure
up
another
case
where
a
plaintiff
in
a
public
figure
libel
matter
can
have
a
case
tried
if
this
one
is
not,
but
it
does
require,
i
believe,
a
fertile
imagination.
thank
you.
