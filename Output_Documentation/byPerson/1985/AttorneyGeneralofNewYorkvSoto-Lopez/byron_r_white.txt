justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
give
them
an
advantage
over
other
people?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
terms
of
encouraging
movement,
coming
back
to
new
york
and
going
to
public
service,
if
you
granted
this
to
all
veterans
you
might
attract
other
veterans
that
weren't
born,
and
who
didn't
go
into
the
service
from
new
york,
to
move
to
new
york
and
to
go
into
public
service
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
give
them
this
advantage?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
would
encourage
this
movement
if
you
did,
to
give
them
that
advantage?
it
would
encourage
it
just
as
much
as
it
would
encourage
veterans
to
return?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
shouldn't
there
be,
in
terms
of
their
objectives
shouldn't
there
be
some
difference
between
the
two
classes
that
you're
comparing?
i
mean,
it
may
serve
that,
but
the
people
you're
alleged
to
be
discriminating
against
would
serve
the
purpose
just
as
well.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
law
should
be
upheld
solely
on
the
single
purpose
of
encouraging
service
in
the
military
by
new
york
residents?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
just
means
that
if
you
happen
to
be
a
resident
on
a
certain
time--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
it
is
residence
at
a
certain
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
was
the
attorney
general
representing?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
he
representing
the
state
of
new
york?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
is
the
state
of
new
york
whose
statute
this
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
filed
the
notice
of
appeal
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
behalf
of
whom?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
he
file...
his
jurisdictional
statement
names
new
york
city.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
appreciate
some
of
your
views
on
the
merits.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we
could
have
this
law
without
the
last
requirement,
namely,
being
a
resident?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
it
encourages
anybody
it
would
encourage
new
yorkers
as
much
as
anybody
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
to
be
a
resident
to
work
for
the
city,
don't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can
live
outside
the
state?
