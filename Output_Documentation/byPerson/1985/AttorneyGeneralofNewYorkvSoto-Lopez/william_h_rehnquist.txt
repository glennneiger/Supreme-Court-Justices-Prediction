justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--general
hermann,
do
you
think
that's
really
what
the
legislature
had
in
mind
when
the
people
adopted
this
part
of
the
constitution,
all
of
these
rather
fine-spun
rationales
for
why
the
thing
might
pass
a
court
test?
isn't
the
usual
motivation
for...
it's
just
kind
of
gratitude
for
people
who
have
served
in
the
service
and
wanting
to
give
them
a
little
bit
of
a
break
after
they
get
out?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
it's
given
in
the
case
law.
you
think,
then,
the
courts
are
probably
the
best
finders
of
legislative
motivation
in
a
case
like
this?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
inference
do
you
draw
from
that
fact
that's
relevant
to
the
argument
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
don't
claim
that
the
fact
that
the
attorney
general
is
the
appellant
is
any
different
than
if
the
state
of
new
york
were
appellant?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
it's
your
position
that
notwithstanding
the
statute
that
permits
the
state
attorney
general
to
intervene
in
actions,
to
defend
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute,
if
he
loses
in
the
state
court,
he
cannot
appeal
that
decision?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
does
the
second
circuit
know
what
new
york's
interest
is
in
a
case
like
this?
why
doesn't
new
york
have
an
interest
in
encouraging
its
own
people
to
volunteer?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
why
doesn't...
isn't
new
york
able
to
deal
with
its
own,
and
perhaps
hope
that
other
states
will
deal
with
their
own?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
this
were
december
7th,
1941,
and
the
new
york
legislature
were
in
session,
said,
we
want
to
do
something
to
encourage
new
york
people
to
enlist
now
or
to
go
in
the
service
and
not
be
conscientious
objectors
if
they're
drafted,
and
get
to
be
veterans,
come
back
to
new
york
and
participate
in
public
life
in
new
york.
we
want
to
do
it
constitutionally.
what
could
they
do?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
saying
that
they
couldn't
limit
it,
then,
to
people
who
enlisted
in
new
york
when
the
legislature
sits
down
on
december
8th,
1941,
they
couldn't
limit
their
benefit
to
people
who
enlisted
when
they
were
residents
of
new
york?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then,
for
all
practical
purposes,
the
state
can
really
do
nothing
by
way
of
encouraging
enlistment
or
encouraging
its
residents
to
become
veterans
and
return?
if
they've
got
to
give
it
to
everybody,
then
it's
just
fiscally
impossible
to
administer?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
it
doesn't
encourage
people
from
new
york
to
serve?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
equally?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
does
it
do
that,
if
someone
could
have
served
from
other
states
and
simply
come
to
new
york
afterwards?
