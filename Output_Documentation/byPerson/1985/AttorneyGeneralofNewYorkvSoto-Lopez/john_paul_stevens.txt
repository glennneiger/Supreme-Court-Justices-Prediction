justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
before
you
go
on
to
the
merits,
who
wrote
the
letter
of
june
17th?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
he
in
substance
says
he
has
no
interest
in
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
it
responds
to
justice
marshall's
quotation
of
the
rules.
i
don't
want
you
to
read
a
long
letter,
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you,
supposing
the
statutes,
instead
of
giving
veterans'
benefits,
provided
that
a
person
shall
be
deemed
a
veteran
if
he,
one,
is
a
new
york
resident
at
the
time
of
enlistment:
two,
is
a
new
york
resident
at
the
end
of
the
war;
and
three,
is
honorably
discharged.
if
within
30
days
after
those
things
all
happen,
the
veteran
asks
for
$100,
the
state
will
give
it
to
him.
would
that
be
unconstitutional,
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
i
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just
wasn't
entirely
clear.
here
you've
got
two
residency
requirements,
before
the
war
and
after.
are
you
saying
either
one
would
be
enough
to
knock
it
out,
or
do
you
rely
on
both?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
suppose
you
didn't
have
that
but
you
had
a
postwar
residency
requirement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
have
to
be
a
resident
to
get
the
bonus
points?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
order
to--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
on
that
question,
i
realize
your
case
is
not
a
cash
benefit
case,
but
i
like
to
try
to
think
of
the
different
forms
of
benefit.
i
take
it
we
have
to
knock
out
the
prior
residency.
can
you
have
a
durational
residency
requirement
to
qualify
for
the
postwar
benefit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
just...
maybe
this
argument
doesn't
acknowledge
much
of
a
state
interest.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--prewar
residency
requirement,
and
once
you
have
a
post-war
durational
requirement,
it
seems
to
me
your
client
could
move
from
state
to
state,
collecting
bonuses,
and
why
not?
might
have
gotten
one
in
puerto
rico,
and
one--
