you
think
that's
the
bright
line
between
those
cases
and
this
one?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
while
i
have
you
interrupted,
does
new
york
have
difficulty
in
recruiting
people
for
public
service?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
are
there
long
waiting
lines
to
get
jobs?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
that,
your
argument
about
wanting
all
these
people
back
in
public
service
rings
a
little
hollow.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
if
the
jobs
are
all
full,
it's
a
little
hard
to
get
in
no
matter
how
hard
you
work?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so,
that
advantage
would
be
true
if
someone
comes
from
puerto
rico
too,
that
served
in
the
armed
services?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
hermann,
i
suppose
that
like
all
those
rationality
cases,
there
are
inequalities
here.
suppose
a
young
man
grew
up
on
a
farm
in
north
dakota
and
didn't
like
it
and
decided
to
come
to
the
big
city,
and
went
there
and
lived
there
for
a
year,
he
was
a
resident,
and
the
war
came
along
and
he
enlisted.
after
the
war
his
father
died
in
the
meantime
so
he
went
back
to
be
farm
in
north
dakota,
spent
a
lot
of
time
there,
got
his
brother
interested
in
the
farm
and
discovered
this
about
the
advantage
in
public
service,
his
bonus
points,
and
after
20
years
came
back
to
your
city
and
lived
there
for
six
months.
he's
entitled
to
bonus
points?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
in
contrast
to
the
two
respondents
here
who
have
lived
in
your
state
a
number
of
years
who
are
not
entitled
to
them?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
is
unequal
in
application?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
make
the
jurisdictional
argument
in
your
brief?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--counsel,
may
i
suggest
that
your
time
is
almost
half
gone
now,
and
you
haven't
touched
the
merits
yet.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
have
any
comment
on
this
court's
summary
affirmance
of
the
august
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
certainly
wasn't
overruled,
was
it?
