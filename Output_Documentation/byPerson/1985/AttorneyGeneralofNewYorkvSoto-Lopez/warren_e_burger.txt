chief

e.
burger
isn't
the
origin
of
that
concept
of
taking
care
of
their
own,
as
you
put
it,
something
that
goes
back
to
at
least
the
civil
war
when
the
states
raised
the
troops
and
sent
them
in,
and
of
course
that
was
true
earlier?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
doesn't
that
have
its
roots
in
the
business
of
granting
bounties
as
they
did
in
the
civil
war
and
earlier?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no
one
would
suggest
that
new
york
had
any
obligation
to
grant
a
bounty
to
somebody
from
new
hampshire
to
join
the
army,
but
they
could
limit
it
to
their
own?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
suggests
that
if
they
do
it
after
the
event
they
can
have
the
same
limitation?

chief

e.

you
have
nothing
further,
mr.
solicitor
general?
chief
justice
warren
e.

thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
