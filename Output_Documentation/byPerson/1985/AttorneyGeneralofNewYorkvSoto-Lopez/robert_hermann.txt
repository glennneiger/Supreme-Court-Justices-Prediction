mr.
robert
hermann
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
veterans'
preference
granted
in
new
york's
constitution
was
upheld
by
this
court
a
dozen
years
ago
against
an
identical
challenge,
that
it
impermissibly
discriminated
against
veterans
who
were
not
residents
of
new
york
at
the
time
they
were
inducted.
that
case
was
called
august
against
bronstein.
the
second
circuit
felt
that
august
against
bronstein
was
no
longer
good
law
in
light
of
recent
doctrinal
developments
in
this
court,
specifically
the
zobel
against
williams
case,
and
presumably
hooper
against
fernalillo
county,
although
that
had
not
been
decided
at
the
time.
we
believe
that
these
recent
decisions
do
not
overrule
the
august,
and
that
new
york's
classification
is
reasonably
designed
to
fulfill
legitimate
state
purposes.
veteran
preference
laws
have
a
long
history
in
this
country,
and
their
constitutionality
is
a
well
settled
matter.
new
york,
as
well
as
15
other
states,
conditions
the
award
on
veterans'
preference
credits
on
residence
in
the
state
at
the
time
of
induction
into
the
military.
since
the
1920's
new
york
has
promised
in
its
constitution
that
if
a
resident
goes
into
the
armed
services,
serves
during
time
of
war,
and
is
honorably
discharged,
that
person
on
passing
a
civil
service
examination
is
entitled
to
five
additional
points
in
competing
for
public
employment.
that
commitment
has
never
been
withdrawn,
and
the
commitment
can
only
be
withdrawn,
we
emphasize,
by
amending
the
state
constitution.
mr.
robert
hermann
no,
i
do
not
believe
there
is.
it's
a
one
time
privilege
but
there
is
no
time
limit
on
its
use.
we
believe
that
whether
new
york's
constitutional
provision
is
viewed
as
a
right
to
travel
matter
or
as
an
equal
protection
matter,
the
result
here
turns
on
whether
at
a
minimum,
new
york's
classification
rationally
furthers
a
legitimate
state
purpose,
and
the
court
of
appeals,
we
know,
is
divided
on
this
point.
we
believe
the
essential
error
in
the
second
circuit's
opinion
was
that
it
failed
to
perceive
that
new
york's
law
rationally
does
further
legitimate
state
purposes
because
the
second
circuit
viewed
the
law
simply
as
a
retrospective
measure,
a
reward
for
past
services.
it
largely
ignored
the
law's
prospective
function
as
an
incentive
measure,
one
designed
to
encourage
service
in
the
military,
to
encourage
persons
to
return
to
the
state
of
new
york,
and
to
engage
in
public
service
thereafter,
and
these
are
separate
purposes
which
i'll
discuss
in
a
moment.
but,
unlike
the
new
mexico
and
alaska
statutes
struck
down
in
recent
cases
of
this
court,
new
york's
constitution
is
and
has
been
for
a
long
time
forward-looking.
forty
years
ago,
in
an
informal...
in
a
formal
opinion
the
state's
attorney
general
described
the
law
as
largely
self-executing,
and
by
that
he
meant
that
as
part
of
the
state's
constitution
it
guaranteed
these
benefits,
and
the
only
function
of
the
legislature
was
to
prescribe
the
periods
of
award.
and
the
attorney
general's
opinion
40
years
ago
specifically
said
that
a
veteran
of
a
war
who
would
have
a
cause
of
action
in
new
york
state
courts
for
this
right
even
if
the
legislature
failed
to
determine
time
of
award.
thus,
this
is
not
an
after
the
fact
attempt
by
the
state
simply
to
take
care
of
its
own,
and
we
believe
that
the
fact
that
the
court
of
appeals
overlooked
this
is
the
critical
flaw
in
its
whole--
mr.
robert
hermann
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
we
discussed
some
of
that
history,
both
the
constitutional
history
and
the
legislative
history,
in
our
brief.
new
york'
statute
goes
back
at
least
until
the
civil
war,
and
i
think
it's
worth
observing
that
the
second
circuit
has
no
discussion
whatsoever
in
its
opinion
of
the
nature
of
that
history,
or
of
the
important
fact
we
rely
on
here
which
is
that
it's
a
constitutional
commitment.
the
second
circuit
found
that
new
york
has
no
legitimate
interest
in
encouraging
its
residents
to
serve
in
the
military,
but
the
court
offered
no
support
or
citation
for
that
conclusion
in
referring
simply
to
patriotism,
as
it
described
it.
we
submit
that
new
york
has
acted
from
patriotic
motives,
and
that
the
second
circuit
was
wrong
in
declaring
illegitimate
new
york's
interest
in
encouraging
its
residents
to
serve.
mr.
robert
hermann
yes,
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
hermann
as
to
people
who
are
drafted,
it
certainly
doesn't
serve
to
encourage
service
in
the
military,
but
it
does
serve
two
subsequent
functions
of
encouraging
them
to
return
to
the
state
and
encouraging
them
to
engage
in
public
service
thereafter.
mr.
robert
hermann
certainly
that's
one
of
the
major
reasons
why
these
statutes
and
these
constitutional
provisions
have
been
enacted,
but
the
standard
justification
given
in
most
of
the
case
law,
your
honor,
for
these
statutes
is
fourfold,
and
two
of
those
purposes...
at
least
one
of
the
major
purposes
always
described
is
to
encourage
service
in
the
military,
and
we
do
rely
on
that
as
a
motivation.
mr.
robert
hermann
i
think
the
applicable
standard
here,
again
we
submit,
is
the
rational
basis
standard
so
that
any
basis
which
can
be
put
forward
to
rationally
justify
the
statute
should
be
sufficient
to
sustain
its
validity.
in
the
initial...
in
the
august
against
bronstein
decision,
the
court
found
that
these
were
the
four
purposes
which
were
served,
and
relying
on
the
opinion
of
chief
judge
friendly
in
a
case
called
russell
against
hodges
we
believe
that
the
states
do
have
a
role
as
states
in
encouraging
service
of
their
residents
in
the
military,
and
that
the
constitution
does
give
the
states
the
role
as
such
in
providing
for
national
defense,
and
we
looked
at
two
things
specifically.
under
article
i,
section
8
of
the
constitution,
the
authority
to
raise
militias
according
to
the
discipline
prescribed
by
congress
is
reserved
to
the
states,
and
clause
15
explicitly
reserves
to
the
states,
and
i
am
quoting,
"the
appointment
of
the
officers
and
the
authority
of
training
the
militia.
"
and
similarly,
the
second
amendment
to
the
constitution
recognizes
that
a
well
regulated
militia
is
necessary
to
the
security
of
a
free
state,
and
under
the
constitution,
congress
is
empowered
to
call
up
and
historically
has
often
called
up
the
militia,
the
state
national
guard,
in
time
of
war
to
provide
for
the
common
defense,
and
indeed
at
this
time
many
of
the
nation's
combat-ready
units
are
included
in
the
state
militias.
thus,
we
believe
the
state
as
a
state,
under
our
constitution,
has
an
interest
in
encouraging
its
residents
to
serve
in
the
military.
similarly,
during
or
just
before
a
time
of
war,
a
military
draft
becomes
a
greater
probability
than
would
otherwise
be
the
case,
and
of
course
much
more
important
than
would
otherwise
be
the
case.
under
our
draft
laws,
quotas
are
set
for
each
state
based
on
the
number
of
eligible
persons
in
that
state
and
based
on
the
number
of
eligible
persons
nationwide,
and
a
state
under
the
selective
service
laws
gets
credit
for
the
number
of
persons
currently
in
the
service.
thus,
we
believe
that
the
state
may
validly
seek
to
encourage
volunteer
service
both
in
order
to
assist
the
nation
and
to
assist
the
state
in
meeting
its
quotas
under
the
national
defense
system,
and
similarly
may
seek
to
minimize
the
burden
on
non-volunteers
who
may
be
providing
important
services
to
the
state
or
to
the
people
of
the
state.
it
seems
to
us
that
a
critical
error
in
the
second
circuit's
opinion
is
to
assume
that
because
new
york
might
have
an
interest
in
encouraging
service
of
all
residents
of
the
united
states
in
the
service,
that
therefore
it
is
illegitimate
for
new
york
to
concentrate
its
efforts
on
its
lesser
included
interest,
namely,
encouraging
its
own
residents
to
serve.
no
doctrine
of
which
we
are
aware
holds
that
a
state
offering
prospective
incentives
for
participation
in
a
national
program
such
as
the
draft
must
make
those
promised
benefits
available
to
all
persons
residing
outside
their
borders,
and
as
a
practical
matter,
new
york
law
targets
the
residents
of
the
state
of
new
york,
simply
because
it
is
not
much
of
an
incentive
to
enter
into
the
military
service
for
a
teen-ager
in
nevada,
to
be
offered
public
service
employment
in
new
york
after
service
in
wartime.
the
new
york
law
also
compensates
veterans,
as
justice
rehnquist
indicated,
and
compensation
is
certainly
one
of
its
most
important
purposes.
again,
the
second
circuit
viewed
that
purpose
purely
retrospectively,
failing
to
recognize,
we
submit,
that
promise
of
compensation
is
so
important
incentive
to
military
service.
even
if
one
were
to
concede
that
rewarding
veterans
after
the
fact
for
military
service
at
some
point
in
the
past
is
not
a
legitimate
state
purpose,
it
does
not
follow,
it
seems
to
us,
that
promising
to
reward
them
in
the
future
for
such
military
service
doesn't
serve
a
legitimate
state
purpose.
that
purpose,
we
submit
again,
is
encouraging
service
in
the
military.
an
additional
important
purpose
that
the
new
york
law
and
the
new
york
constitutional
provisions
are
intended
to
fulfill
is
to
encourage
skilled
veterans
to
come
home
and
to
serve
in
the
public
service.
a
wartime
veteran,
as
i
am
sure
this
court
is
aware,
acquires
skills
and
experiences
which
make
that
person
a
very
desirable
employee,
whether
for
government
or
for
anybody
else,
and
we
would
of
course
concede
that
that
is
true
of
all
veterans,
whether
they
reside...
whether
they
have
ever
resided
in
new
york
or
not.
nonetheless,
we
believe
that
new
york
has
a
valid
interest,
unrelated
to
any
desire
to
reward
its
own
people,
to
encourage
former
residents
to
come
back
to
new
york
after
time
of
war
and
to
engage
in
public
service.
i
think
it's
important
to
focus
on
the
group
that
new
york
is
targeting
with
this
provision,
entirely
apart
from
the
questions,
that
the
incentive
purpose
of
going
into
the
military
for
the
person
who
is
drafted,
for
example.
the
group
new
york
has
always
targeted
with
the
statue
is
the
group
which
is
by
definition
is
uprooted,
new
york
residents
who
have
gone
to
war.
whether
or
not
they
have
done
so,
again
in
reliance
on
the
promise
of
preferential
consideration
at
a
later
point,
it
is
reasonable
for
the
state
to
give
them
some
encouragement
to
return
home
and
new
york,
beyond
that,
is
interested
not
only
in
getting
residents
to
return
home
but
to
engage
in
public
service
when
they
do
so,
and
this
court
has
frequently
indicated
that
a
state's
interest
in
maximizing
the
quality
of
its
public
work
force
is
an
important
one
which
may
justify
restrictions
that
otherwise
might
be
constitutionally
doubtful.
quite
arguably,
based
on
this
court's
decisions,
new
york
could
not
constitutionally
make
such
distinctions
after
the
fact.
an
example
is
that
new
york
could
not
declare
in
1946
that
state
residents...
that
persons
who
had
gone
to
college
in
new
york
state
in
1961
would
receive
tuition
assistance
grants,
because
that
would
discriminate
against
persons
who
had
become
residents
of
the
state
of
new
york
subsequent
to
1981.
but
we
submit
there
is
no
doubt
that
prospectively
in
1981,
new
york
could
have
adopted
tuition
support
grants
to
persons
who
were
residents
in
the
state
at
that
time,
as
this
court's
decisions
is
that
area
have
made
clear.
we
certainly
concede
that
new
york
could
have
drafted
this
statute
and
could
have
framed
its
constitutional
provisions
in
such
a
way
as
to
more
closely
and
more
precisely
retained
its
objectives,
and
perhaps
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
in
fact
are
as
well
qualified
as
some
other
people
who
received
a
preference
under
new
york
statute.
but
the
distinction
new
york
makes,
we
submit,
is
a
rational
one
in
view
of
the
critical
incentive
purposes.
new
york's
constitutional
provision
does
encourage
service
both
in
the
military
and
in
civil
service
employment,
and
those
are
legitimate
objectives
and
this
court
has
frequently
said
that--
mr.
robert
hermann
--no,
your
honor,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record.
the
case
came
up
on
initial
motions
for
summary
judgment.
mr.
robert
hermann
that's
correct.
it
is
an
incentive
purpose
that
has
historically
been
given
for
the
statute,
and
whether...
we
don't
know
whether
this
constitutional
provision
encourages
one
or
100
people
to
do
that,
but
i
think
it
can
clearly
be
said
to
do
that
in
some
number
of
cases.
to
return
for
a
moment
to
the
zobel
and
hooper
decisions,
both
the
alaska
dividend
statute
and
the
new
mexico
property
tax
exemption,
which
were
invalidated
by
this
court,
were
after
the
fact
enactments
designed
to
compensate
prior
status
or
prior
conduct.
neither
had
a
prospective
purpose
related
to
some
legitimate
state
objective.
mr.
robert
hermann
yes,
i
do,
that
in
both
instances,
whether
for
a
defined
objective
such
as
rewarding
past
military
service
or
an
undefined
objective
such
as
simple
residence
in
the
state,
both
enactments
were
entirely
retrospective
and
served
no
incentive
function
of
the
kind
that
we're
describing
here.
in
fact,
in
hooper
there
wasn't
even
a
claim
that
they
did
serve
any
such
prospective
function.
mr.
robert
hermann
no,
it
doesn't,
as
far
as
i'm
aware.
new
york
has
a
very
large
public
service
force,
larger
than
some
citizens
would
like
it
to
be.
mr.
robert
hermann
it
frequently
does,
yes.
mr.
robert
hermann
well,
it's
twofold.
it's
wanting
them
to
come
back
to
the
state,
and
wanting
them
to
come
back
to
the
state
to
utilize
their
special
attributes
in
the
public
service.
it's
not
because
new
york
is
short
on
public
sector
applicants.
it's
because
new
york
does
feel
some
debt
of
gratitude
to
those
people
and
wants
them
back.
mr.
robert
hermann
certainly,
one
of
the
underlying
justifications
is
not
only
that
veterans
should
be
compensated,
but
that
they
are
an
especially
important,
desirable
part
of
the
work
force,
and
this--
mr.
robert
hermann
--yes,
we
do.
we
give
veterans
an
advantage
and
disabled
veterans
get
an
additional
preference.
mr.
robert
hermann
that's
true.
we
certainly
don't
claim
that
that
person
doesn't
possess
the
attributes
necessary
to
perform
public
service
effectively
in
new
york.
i
would
point
out
that
the
court
in
hooper
did
explicitly
recognize
that
veterans'
benefit
statutes
which
conditioned
residency...
which
conditioned
the
granting
of
preferences
to
residency
in
the
state
at
the
time
of
induction
might
indeed
present
a
wholly
different
consideration
from
the
ones...
from
the
statute
under
consideration
there,
and
that's
noted
in
both
the
majority
and
the
dissenting
opinions.
mr.
robert
hermann
that's
correct,
and
new
york
does
not
attempt
to
discourage
persons
from
doing
so.
mr.
robert
hermann
we
don't
give
them
this
advantage,
but
neither
does
new
york
fence
them
out.
mr.
robert
hermann
well,
it
would
not
give
the
incentive
as
effectively
to
those
people
who
had
been
new
york
residents
to
come
back
home,
if
the
preference
were
more
widely
available
to
persons
from
the
other
49
states.
but
even
if
that's
correct,
that
there
is
no
special
attribute
to
a
new
york...
to
a
prior
new
york
resident
who
has
served
in
the
military,
it
does
not
follow,
it
seems
to
us,
that
the
law
does
not
serve
the
rational
purpose
for
which
it
was
intended,
and
the
objective
of
getting
those
residents
to--
mr.
robert
hermann
--well,
i
think
we
would
contend
that
it
wouldn't
serve
it
just
as
well
but
that
the
law
would
fail
to...
if
that
were
the
policy,
the
law
would
fail
of
its
other
purpose
which
is
to
encourage
service
in
the
military
in
the
first
place
by
new
york
residents,
and
the
additional
purpose,
of
course,
of
encouraging
residents
to
return
home.
mr.
robert
hermann
we
think
that's
sufficient,
yes.
i
think
the
new
york
law
furthers
legitimate
additional
purposes,
but
i
believe
that
the
strongest
justification
for
the
law
is
encouraging
service.
mr.
robert
hermann
it
is
not
a
durational
residency
requirement.
mr.
robert
hermann
it's
a
fixed
point
residency
requirement
and
indeed
we
think
that's
crucial
in
terms
of
the
right
to
travel
argument,
because
we
believe
new
york's
provision
does
not
penalize
the--
mr.
robert
hermann
--i
think
it
does.
mr.
robert
hermann
i
think
has
historically
done
so.
mr.
robert
hermann
i
believe
that's
correct,
although
i
believe
new
york's
promise
as
a
part
of
its
constitution
is
a
clearly
prospective
one.
in
terms
of
the
right
to
travel,
we
believe
that
the
provision
cannot
be
said
to
penalize
the
right
to
travel
and
that...
certainly
it
wasn't
true
in
this
case.
i
just
point
out,
this
is
not
a
class
action.
this
is
an
action
brought
by
two
individuals
who
had
been
residents
of
the
state
of
new
york
for
more
than
ten
years
before
applying
for
the
veterans'
preference
credits
here.
ultimately
one
of
them
did
obtain
civil
service
employment,
as
do
many
non-residents
and
non-resident
veterans.
but
this
court's
decisions,
i
think,
make
clear
that
the
claimed
penalty
on
the
right
to
travel
has
to
be
examined
on
a
case
by
case
basis
in
view
of
the
objectives
of
the
statutes
and
the
requirements
of
the
statute.
new
york's
constitution
as
noted
seeks
to
encourage
several
things.
anyone
contemplating
service
in
the
military
during
wartime
or
any
other
time
is
free
to
move
to
the
state
to
help
the
state
fulfill
that
purpose,
if
they
subsequently
wish
to
collect
that
reward,
and
in
terms
of
the
right
to
travel,
we
submit
that
that
is
the
critical
time
and
the
three-judge
court
opinion
in
august
against
bronstein,
we
submit,
was
correct
in
analogizing
this
situation
to
this
court's
decision
in
1973
at
the
time
it
was
deciding
these
durational
residency
cases.
in
spatt
against
new
york,
it
was
a
summary
affirmance
of
this
court
upholding
the
restriction
of
new
york
state
tuition
grants
to
new
york
residents
only.
we
submit
that
the
claim
that
the
plaintiffs
advance
in
this
case
is
analogous
to
a
claim
that
might
be
made
on
behalf
of
the
california
resident
who,
having
gone
to
a
state
college
in
new
york
at
some
previous
time,
subsequently
moved
to
new
york
to
claim
the
tuition
refund.
the
claimed
inequality
doesn't
exist
because
it
ignores
the
incentive
purposes
of
the
law,
the
purpose
of
the
law
in
the
tuition
situation
being
to
encourage
state
residents
to
go
to
state
colleges.
her
right
to
travel,
we
submit,
would
not
be
penalized
by
such
a
limitation
because
she
was
free
at
the
time
she
lived
in
california
to
move
to
the
state
of
new
york
to
obtain
state
scholarship
assistance
if
she
wanted.
i
would
point
out
one
more
thing
about
the
statute,
and
that
is
that
it's
in
terms
of
the
right
to
travel
that
its
effect
is
quite
modest,
as
judge
friendly
described
it
in
that
opinion
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
and
dissipates
over
time.
it's
a
provision
that
can
be
used
on
one
occasion
for
one
appointment
and
that
the
class
of
veterans
who
are
eligible
for
this
benefit
is
steadily
diminishing,
i
would
point
out,
because
for
the
past
ten
years
at
least
no
one
has
been
able
to
satisfy
the
requirement
of
service
during
time
of
war.
thus,
this
case
is
not
like
the
zobel
case,
we
submit,
where
there
was
an
ever-increasing
class
of
persons
who
were
given
preferential
treatment
based
solely
on
their
length
of
residence.
again,
in
terms
of
the
right
to
travel,
we
believe
that
justice
brennan's
concurring
opinion
in
zobel
illustrates
here
why
there
was
no
denial
of
the
right
to
travel,
for
the
same
reason
that
there
was
no
denial
of
equal
protection,
and
that
is
that
the
state's
concern
was
not
solely
with
rewarding
past
conduct,
whether...
or
past
contributions
whether
those
contributions
were
defined
or
undefined.
here,
as
that
concurring
opinion
put
it,
the
business
of
the
state
was
not
with
the
past
or
with
the
present,
and
one
such
item
of
business
which
the
court...
which
that
opinion
noted
was
filling
current
needs,
and
we
submit
that
new
york's
statute
and
new
york's
constitutional
provision
are
clearly
aimed
at
doing
so
and
do
not
depend
entirely
on
a
post
hoc
past
contributions
rationale
to
support
them.
i
believe
they
are
there
for--
mr.
robert
hermann
--he
would
be
entitled
to
claim
them.
mr.
robert
hermann
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
hermann
well,
it
is
differential
in
its
application.
we
think
that
new
york
targets
a
specific
group
for
a
specific
person.
i
think
this
court's
decisions
don't
make
clear
that
that
kind
of
imprecision,
perhaps
exemplified
by
the
facts
in
this
case,
is
not
fatal,
however,
under
a
rational
relationship
standard.
i
would
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
robert
hermann
yes,
your
honor.
just
on
the
retrospectivity
point,
new
york
has,
as
i
have
mentioned,
both
a
constitutional
commitment
and
a
statutory
commitment.
part
of
the
reason
for
having
these
provisions
in
both
places
is
that
it's
obviously
necessary
for
the
legislature
frequently
to
define
and
redefine
time
of
war,
but
also
new
york
wanted
to
emphasize
the
fundamental
nature
of
its
commitment.
obviously,
any
statute
which
has
a
requirement
of
service
during
time
of
war
must
at
some
point
be
amended
to
define
that
time
of
war.
i'm
sure
the
state
of
new
york
would
have
preferred
to
define
prospectively
in
1967
the
end
of
the
vietnam
war,
but
of
course
it
was
unable
to
do
so,
so
that
built
into
any
such
requirement
is
that...
is
the
obligation
of
the
state
legislature
at
certain
points
in
time,
to
define
time
of
war.
what
new
york
did
here,
unlike
what
new
mexico
did
in
hooper
against
bernalillo,
is
frequently
during
the
vietnam
period
to
define
time
of
war
as
including
the
past
six
months,
the
past
year
or
whatever,
and
it
did
that
repeatedly
through
the
course
of
that
time,
and
indeed
those
frequent
amendments
to
the
new
york
statute
show
the
depth
of
new
york's
commitment
to
this
policy.
just
to
answer
justice
powell's
question
about
the
vietnam
war
and
its
being
an
undeclared
war,
new
york's
provision
on
this
tracks
very
closely,
as
does
new
york
statute,
the
federal
provisions
which
define
veterans'
benefits
in
terms
of
time
of
war.
congress...
the
relevant
federal
statute
speaks
of
the
vietnam
era,
and
the
president
declared
several
times
during
the
course
of
the
early
'70s
the
end
of
the
vietnam
era,
and
for
statutory
purposes
that
sufficed
under
federal
programs.
new
york
adopted
the
same
terminology
as
far
as
treating
the
vietnam
era
as
a
time
of
war,
since
the
federal
government
had
done
the
same
thing,
in
essence.
