may
i
ask
this
question,
does
it
apply
to
people
who
were
drafted
as
well
as
those
who
enlist?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
you've
said
in
that
respect--

it's
probably
irrelevant
to
your
case,
but
was
there
ever
a
declaration
of
war
against
north
vietnam?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
how,
then,
could
your
client
have
any
claim
to
be
a
veteran
in
the
course
of
a
war?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
we
refer
to
it
as
a
war,
but
congress
never
declared
it
as
a
war
and
congress
only
has
authority...
only
the
congress
has
the
authority
to
do
that.
