just
your
statement?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
do
you
deal
with...
in
rules
of
this
court
which
say
that
all
parties
to
the
proceedings
in
the
court
from
which
judgment
appeal
is
being
taken
shall
be
deemed
parties
in
this
court,
unless
the
appellants
have
notified
the
clerk
of
this
court
in
writing,
the
appellants'
belief
that
one
or
more
of
the
parties
before
has
no
interest
in
the
outcome
of
the
appeal?

in
where?

that
all,
to
my
question?
justice
thurgood
marshall
have
you
raised
before
this
court
the
fact
that
they
are
not
parties?
justice
thurgood
marshall
--mr.
kimerling,
to
get
back
to
the
old
question,
isn't
it
true
that
the
state
intervened
as
a
party
defendant,
and
was
a
party
defendant
below?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
didn't
that
answer
my
question,
if
you
had
told
me
that?
