mr.
kenneth
kimerling
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
briefly
review
the
facts
here
as
they
assist
in
our
understanding
of
the
irrationality
of
new
york's
veterans'
preference
system.
in
order
to
qualify...
be
treated
as
a
veteran
in
new
york,
you
must,
one,
serve
in
the
armed
forces
during
time
of
war.
two,
you
must
be
honorably
discharged
from
that
service.
three,
you
must
pass
a
civil
service
examination.
four,
you
must
be
a
present
resident
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
fifth,
and
lastly,
you
must
have
been
a
resident
at
the
time
of
induction.
it
is
this
past
and
present
residency
requirement
that
is
at
issue
here,
and
which
denies
the
plaintiffs
here
from
being
treated
as
veterans.
plaintiff
baez
fernandez
entered
the
armed
forces
from
puerto
rico
and
served
from
1958
through
1960,
at
which
time
he
was
dishonorably...
excuse
me,
honorably
discharged
and
entered
the
reserves.
he
moves
to
new
york
in
1968,
settles
in
new
york,
and
in
1970
he's
called
up
from
the
reserves,
serves
in
active
duty,
is
injured,
and
receives
a
service-related
disability,
but
he's
not
a
veteran.
if
he
had
not
joined
the
reserves
but
had
come
to
new
york
and
then
re-enlisted
in
1970
he
would
have
been
treated
as
a
veteran,
but
because
he
did
his
patriotic
duty
and
stayed
in
the
reserves
he's
not
a
veteran.
the
result
of
that,
in
1981
and
in
1982
he's
denied
three
appointments,
which
his
ten
points
as
a
disabled
veteran
would
have
gotten
him.
those
appointments
were
cancelled
when
it
was
learned
that
he
entered
the
service
from
puerto
rico
and
not
from
new
york.
mr.
soto-lopez
entered
the
service
also
from
puerto
rico
in
1961
and
served
through
1963.
also
this
was
in
time
of
war.
the
1973
service
of
mr.
baez-hernandez
was
his
time
of
war
service
during
the
vietnam
era.
mr.
soto-lopez,
after
serving
during
the
vietnam
era,
in
1965
comes
to
new
york,
settles
and
becomes
a
resident
of
the
state
of
new
york.
thus
he's
a
veteran
serving
during
time
of
war,
honorably
discharged,
present
resident
for
15
years,
and
then
in
1982
is
denied
being
treated
as
a
veteran
because
he
had
not
been
inducted
from
new
york.
the
original
defendants
here
were
agencies
of
the
city
of
new
york
who
would
have
been
plaintiff's
employers.
they
have
not
appealed.
the
appellant
is
only
the
attorney
general
who
intervened
pursuant
to
28
u.s.c.
24-03-b,
solely
to
defend
the
constitutionality
of
these
provisions.
none
of
the
relief
that
plaintiffs
have
obtained
or
have
sought
runs
against
this
appellant.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
i
think
the
inference
is
that
this
court
lacks
jurisdiction.
and
let
me
amplify
on
that
if
i
could,
a
moment.
this
question,
that
is
whether
or
not
the
24-03
grants
standing
in
this
situation
has
never
been
resolved
by
a
court.
it
was
raised
previously
in
this
court
and
a
decision
in
1943
in
united
states
versus
johnson,
but
left
unresolved.
the
issue
is
very
simply
that
there
is
no
case
of
controversy
between
the
plaintiff
and
the
appellant
here.
the
case
of
controversy
is
between
the
plaintiff
and
the
city
of
new
york
but
was
not
appealed.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
he
is
here
in
his
ex
officio
capacity
solely
to
defend
the
constitution.
there
is
no
monetary,
or
no
other
claim
that
runs
against
the
attorney
general.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
he
is
representing
the
state
of
new
york
in
its
effort--
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
--that
is
correct,
but
what
i
think
is
instructive--
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
--no,
we
have
not.
it's
frankly
an
issue
that
arose
and
became
a
parent
to
me
in
preparing
for
the
argument,
and--
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
--well,
let
me
continue
then,
if
i
may,
briefly.
i
think
what
helps
assist
this
court
is
reaching
the
issue,
whether
or
not
there
is
justiciability,
is
the
muskrat
case,
one
of
the
first
cases
that
dealt
with
advisory
opinions.
in
muskrat,
as
this
court
recalls,
congress
tried
to
set
up
a
jurisdictional
provision
to
allow
for
the
tests
of
constitutionality
of
legislation.
in
muskrat,
in
1902,
congress
granted
certain
cherokee
indians
rights.
in
1904
and
'06,
those
rights
were
diluted
by
giving
additional
people
benefits
that
the
1902
people
had
for
themselves.
so,
in
1907
congress
said,
let's
see
whether
this
subsequent
legislation,
1904
and
'06
legislation,
is
constitutional.
so,
it
said,
we
grant
jurisdiction
to
the
court
of
claims.
we
grant
jurisdiction
to
the
supreme
court
on
appeal
to
hear
a
claim
by
four
plaintiffs
who
are
the
beneficiaries
of
the
1902
legislation.
they
can
come
to
court
as
class
representatives
of
those
people,
and
the
defendant
shall
be
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
this
court
in
muskrat
then
said
there
was
not
a
case
of
controversy
under
article
3,
as
the
united
states
attorney
general
did
not
have
sufficient
interest
under
article
3
to
create
a
case
of
controversy
in
regard
to
the
real
interest
of
the
plaintiffs
in
the
muskrat
case.
i
think,
in
addition,
this
court
might
want
to
look
at
the
boston
towboat
case
versus
united
states
which
is
a
1943
decision.
the
boston
towboat
company,
the
company
that
intervened
in
a
lower
court
case
between
the
cornell
steamboat
company
and
the
united
states,
the
icc,
the
icc
had
said
that
cornell
is
covered
by
the
interstate
commerce
act.
boston
intervened
in
that
case
because
it
was
a
tugboat
company
in
boston,
cornell...
there
was
a
tugboat
company
in
new
york
harbor.
it
intervened,
obviously,
to
hope
to
avoid
a
precedent
which
would
say
that
tugboat
companies
should
be
covered
under
the
interstate
commerce
act.
after
an
adverse
decision
against
cornell,
the
boston
tugboat
company,
the
intervenor,
appealed
to
this
court
and
this
court
denied
and
dismissed
the
appeal
saying
the
intervenor
who
had
come
in
solely
because
he
was
concerned
about
the
precedential
value
as
it
would
run
against
him,
and
indeed
he
was
in
court
in
massachusetts
against
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
there
was
no
appeal
jurisdiction.
and,
i
should
point
out
that
there
was
cast
granted
to
the
cornell
steamboat
company
at
the
same
time.
lastly,
i
think
that
the
other
case
that
helps
in
resolving
this
question
is
maybe
the
earliest
decision
about
advisory
opinions,
the
hay-burns
case.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
only
the
attorney
general.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
only
on
behalf
of
themselves,
to
defend
the
constitutionality
of
these
provisions.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
he
had
to
amend
that
when
the
clerk
pointed
out
to
him
that
that
was
not
the
case.
there
is
a
letter,
indeed,
from
the
clerk
to
the
city,
saying
they
are
not
appellants.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
i
don't
think
it
makes
a
difference,
that's
correct,
as
long
as
the
only
issue
is
the
precedential
value
of
the--
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
--that's
correct.
that's
absolutely
correct,
and
i
think
a
tangential
issue
that
arises
from
that
is
whether
he
is
bound
by
that
opinion,
having
been
a
party.
i
think
this
court,
in
mendoza,
united
states
versus
mendoza,
sort
of
resolves
that
by
saying
the
government
is
not
bound
in
a
non-mutual
collateral
estoppel
situation,
applied
to
the
united
states
government.
i
don't
think
principles
there
would
be
different.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
one,
i
would
point
out
that
there
is
such
a
letter
to
the
clerk.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
i'm
sorry.
it's
dated
june
17th,
1995.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
it
says,
mr.
stevens.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
excuse
me,
where
is
that?
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
it's
in
my
file.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
i
appreciate
that.
we
did
not
raise
this
issue.
it's
become
an
issue
that
justice
rehnquist--
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
--fine.
i'll
be
happy
to
turn
to
the
merits.
the
issue
to
be
resolved
here--
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
no,
we
have
not.
we
have
not
presented
it
in
our
brief
opposing
the
appeal,
or
in
the
merits
brief.
it
was,
as
i
said,
an
issue
that
became
apparent
to
me
in
preparing
for
the
oral
argument,
and
when
justice
rehnquist
raised
the
obvious
question,
i
answered
that
question.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
the
chief
of
the
appellate
division
of
the
corporation
counsel
of
the
city
of
new
york,
leonard
kerner.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
i'm
sorry,
i--
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
--no,
i'll
read
the
first
line.
"in
reference
to
the
above
case.
"
which
is
this,
obviously,
"we
wish
to
inform
the
court
that
the
city
of
new
york
is
not
participating
in
the
appeal.
"
let
me
go
further,
justice
marshall.
i
think
that
even
if
they
had
not
written
that
letter
and
were
appellees
here
under
that
applicable
rule,
which
they
are
not,
i
still
think
that
there
would
be
still
a
sincere
article
on
the
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
a
case
of
controversy,
because
the
appellant
is
the
one
presenting
it
and
not
the
city
of
new
york,
but
i
don't
think
we
have
to
reach
that.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
fine.
thank
you
for
reminding
me
of
that.
as
i
started
to
say,
i
think
that
the
issue
here
is
what
interest
if
any
does
the
state
of
new
york
have
in
differentiating
between
its
past
and
present...
between
its
resident
veterans
based
on
past
and
prior
residency,
whether
new
york
must
show
a
compelling
state
interest
or
a
substantial
interest
or
must
meet
some
lesser
standard,
need
not
be
decided
by
this
court,
as
new
york
had
been
unable
to
articulate
even
a
legitimate
state
interest.
the
court's
decisions
recently
in
hooper
and
zobel
make
it
clear
that
states
cannot
legitimately
distribute
rights
and
benefits
based
on
prior
and
past
residency,
and
that's
what's
at
issue
here.
plaintiffs
stand
in
the
same
shoes
as
every
other
veteran.
they
served
in
the
armed
forces,
honorably
discharged,
present
residents
of
the
state
of
new
york.
the
only
difference
between
them
and
those
that
obtained
these
benefits
is
their
past
and
prior
residency,
so
that
the
class
that
we're
looking
to
that
is
the
people
who
have
past
and
prior
residencies
get
the
benefit.
those
that
don't
get
the
benefit,
that
is
exactly
what
was
at
issue
in--
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
--let
me
address
that,
because
obviously
the
attorney
general
relies
heavily
on
that.
it
does
not.
let
me
make
it...
it
operates
retrospectively
in
the
very
same
ways
that
the
provisions
in
hooper
and
zobel
operated
retrospectively.
that
is,
they
looked
back
to
prior
or
past
residency
to
determine
the
beneficiaries
of
certain
provisions.
it
is
this
looking
back
that
was
significant
to
the
court
in
those
decisions.
it
was
not--
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
--that's
right.
the
retrospectiveness
should
be
distinguished
from
after
the
fact,
or
retroactive
legislation.
indeed,
in
hooper
the
court
noted
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
encouraging
resettlement
in
the
state
could
not
have
been
served
because
there
was
retroactive
legislation.
but,
what
the
court
noted
in
footnote
8
of
that
opinion
was,
it
did
have,
although
not
raised
by
the
parties,
some
prospective
effects,
some
encouraging
effects.
it
encouraged
people
who
had
moved
to
the
state
before
'76
to
remain,
it
encouraged
people
who
had
lived
in
new
mexico
prior
to
'76
to
return.
so,
it
did
have
prospective
effects.
yet,
the
court
said
in
that
footnote,
it
still
could
not
meet
the
constitutional
barrier
because
it
still
distinguished
people
based
on
past
or
prior
residency.
in
zobel
as
well,
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
concurring
opinions
there,
although
the
majority
opinions
did
not
reach
the
issue,
the
concurring
opinions
indicate
that
those...
alaska
could
have
said,
okay,
in
1980
we're
going
to
start
distributing
benefits
and
anybody
who
is
a
resident
in
1980
has
got
one
share.
by
1981
you've
got...
people
who
are
living
in
1980
have
got
two
shares
and
the
person
that
moves
in
1981
has
got
one
share.
this
would
not
have,
obviously,
changed
the
results
of
the
concurring
opinions
since
it
would
still
have
relied
on
past
or
prior
residency
for
distributing
benefits,
albeit
prospective
legislation...
it
is
not
the
after
the
fact
nature
of
the
legislation
but
rather,
it's
retrospective
looking
back
at
past
or
prior
residency
which
is
important.
and
that's
exactly
how
new
york's
legislation
is
like
that
in
hooper
and
zobel.
let
me
turn
to
what
new
york
argues
very
strenuously,
is
the
purpose
here,
and
that
is
to
encourage
service
in
the
armed
forces.
it's
not
quite
that.
they're
arguing,
it
encourages
enlistment
in
the
armed
forces
because
they
argue
that
at
the
time
of
enlistment
we
vest
or
distribute
rights
to
future
benefits.
that's
their
argument,
and
therefore
they
say,
that's
a
crucial
juncture
in
time,
and
therefore
we
can
vest,
you
know,
we
can
impose
a
bona
fide
residency
requirement.
but,
let's
look...
it's
clear
that
that
is
not
what
is
happening
here
in
these
provisions,
and
even
if
it
were,
it
still
wouldn't
meet
constitutional
master.
look
at
the
language.
it
doesn't
define
these
as
enlisted
benefits.
it
doesn't
define
an
enlistee.
the
provisions
define
a
veteran,
and
the
criteria
for
obtaining
these
benefits
is
not
enlistment,
it's
service
in
the
armed
forces
and
honorable
discharge
and
passing
the
civil
service
examination.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
yes,
it
would.
it
would.
it
would
be
different
from
what
we
have
here.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
and
it
would
be
unconstitutional
because,
as
the
second
circuit
pointed
out,
new
york
as
no
interest
in
encouraging
the
service,
only
its
own.
new
york's
interest
is
in
a
common
defense.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
oh,
it
does.
it
does,
but
it
doesn't
have
an
interest
in
exclusion
of
encouraging
others,
because
it
has
an
interest
in
a
common
defense.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
they
could,
if
they
had
legislation
that
did
that.
it's
not
this
legislation.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
i
think
they
could
have
a
bounty
at
that
time
for
anyone
who
showed
up
in
the
state
of
new
york
without
any
bona
fide
residency
requirement.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
being
a
prior
resident
as
opposed
to
a
present
resident
at
the
time
the
bounty--
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
--no,
because
as
i
said,
i
think
their
interest
has
to
be
in
everyone
being
in
the
armed
services.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
they
can
do
it
here.
it's
not
fiscally
impossible.
most
states
do
not
have
this
prior
residency
requirements.
who
comes
to
those
states
as
veterans
gets
the
benefit.
it's
not
unmanageable.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
oh,
yes,
it
does--
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
--equally.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
because
they're
all
then
treated
equally
as
veterans.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
absolutely.
absolutely,
justice
white.
but,
i
think
it's
important
to
point
out
that
that's
not
what's
at
issue
here.
i
think
justice
white
pointed
out,
it's
not
only
enlistees
who
are
beneficiaries,
it's
draftees.
moreover,
it's
not
only
those
that
enlist
during
time
of
war
who
are
the
beneficiaries.
you
can
enlist
at
any
time
as
long
as
you
serve
during
time
of
war
and
that's
why
these
are,
as
you
pointed
out,
justice
rehnquist,
really
provisions
to
reward
and
compensate
for
that
service.
that's
what's
determinative.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
well,
we
certainly
don't
have
to
look
at
the
second
because
our
clients
are
present
residents,
but
i
think
the
first
one,
the
prior
residency,
is
the
one
that's
at
issue
here.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
i
think
you
have
an
altogether
different
question
there.
you
have
a
privileges
and
immunities
question
of
residents
versus
nonresidents.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
no,
that
is
not
correct.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
that's
correct,
yes.
so,
there's
a
distinction.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
well,
there
may
be
another
issue
here,
but
it's
not
presented
by
plaintiffs.
there
is
a
state
court
challenge,
by
the
way,
on
that
issue,
ongoing.
but
again,
the
provisions
that
we've
been
talking
about
hypothetically
aren't
what's
at
issue
here.
one
is,
the
language
doesn't
lend
itself
to
that
in
any
way.
two,
draftees
and
enlistees
are
treated
differently...
are
treated
the
same.
thirdly,
regardless
of
when
you
enter
the
service,
whether
it's
a
time
of
war
or
not,
you
are
entitled
to
the
benefits.
fourthly,
if
we
look
at
the
fact
that
disabled
people
are
given
additional
benefits,
thus
indicating
clear
intent
to
compensate
as
opposed
to
encourage,
the
state
is
not
encouraging
people
to
become
handicapped.
lastly,
as
in
hooper,
the
legislation
here
is
largely
retroactive.
during
the
civil
war...
excuse
me,
during
the
vietnam
war,
it
was
three
years
after
what
new
york
deemed
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
that
they
retroactively
recognized
the
war
in
vietnam.
so,
for
a
three-year
period,
people
who
either
enlisted
or
served
were
not
encouraged
by
this
legislation,
and
the
state
had
not
acted,
but
yet
these
were
beneficiaries
because
they
had
served,
and
that's
what
the
purpose
was.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
yes.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
no,
there
was
not.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
in
only
that
the
state
of
new
york
has
defined
the
vietnam
war
era,
beginning
on
january
1st,
1963
and
running
through
may
of
'75.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
that's
why
defendant's
reliance...
appellant's
reliance
on
that
1946
attorney
general's
opinion
is
really
not
very
strong
because
you
didn't
have
undeclared
wars.
now
you
have
undeclared
wars
and
it
has
to
be
defined
to
be
self-executing.
it
can't
be
self-executing.
people
that
served
in
grenada
and
in
lebanon
are
not
veterans,
albeit
they
were
shot
at
and
some
killed,
obviously,
but
because
new
york
hadn't
deemed
it
a
time
of
war,
veterans
from
those
eras
are
not
covered.
but,
let
me
go
back
to
this
retroactivity
issue
because
i
think
it's
parallel
to
what
this
court
looked
at
in
hooper.
in
june
of
1973
the
new
york
state
legislature
said,
the
vietnam
war
is
over,
march
1973,
the
war
is
over.
therefore
if
you
enlist
from
now
on,
there
are
no
benefits.
in
1983,
it
retroactively
amended
to
be
may
of
1975.
many
of
the
men
and
women
who
enlisted
in
'73,
'74
and
'75
were
not
encouraged
by
this
legislation
at
all.
they
were
discouraged
if
anything
by
new
york's
statement
that
the
war
was
over
in
vietnam,
yet
as
of
1983
they
are
the
beneficiaries.
so,
i
think
it's
clear
that
this
new
refinement,
albeit
of
the
attorney
general,
really
doesn't
mesh
with
what
the
statute
provides.
it
is
not
what
anyone
was
talking
about
then
in
terms
of
vesting
benefits
at
the
time
of
enlistment.
i've
spent
a
good
deal
of
my
time
on
the
equal
protection
arguments
and
how
these
provisions
violate
plaintiff's
rights
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
let
me
turn
briefly
to
the
right
to
travel
provisions,
because
i
think
under
those
provisions
as
well,
new
york
state
veterans'
credit
provisions
fail
to
meet
constitutional
muster.
when
states
set
up
categories
of
present
residents
and
then
they
distinguish
among
them
based
on
past
or
prior
residency,
they
distinguish
based
on
newly
migrated
versus
older
residents,
and
these
kinds
of
distinctions
are
the
very
kinds
that
the
right
to
travel
most
appropriately
deals
with,
and
the
right
to
travel
here
is
substantially
penalized
and
substantially
burdened
contrary
to
the
appellant's
suggestion.
veterans'
credits
mean
often
the
difference
between
unemployment
and
employment
in
a
civil
service
career
with
all
the
attendant
securities
and
benefits
that
those
kinds
of
careers
lend
themselves
to.
not
only
can
these
credits
be
used
at
the
entry
level
point,
but
veterans
optionally
can
use
them
on
promotional
examinations,
and
finally
at
the
time
of
layoff,
a
veteran
is
entitled
to
as
many
as
five
years
additional
seniority
at
the
time
of
layoff
to
allow
them
to
withstand
layoffs.
so,
these
are
substantial
benefits,
certainly
more
substantial
than
the
$50
at
issue
in
zobel,
and
therefore
the
right
to
travel
has
been
burdened
here.
if
we
apply
the
equal
protection
analysis,
new
york
must
meet
the
compelling
state
interest
test
or
at
least
some
heightened
scrutiny,
and
unable
to
articulate
even
a
legitimate
state
purpose,
they
obviously
cannot
meet
the
compelling
state
interest
test.
if
we
evaluate
it
under
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
of
article
4,
again
new
york
state
could
not
meet
the
two
part
test
there,
having
been...
they
are
not
able...
certainly
not
even
attempting,
but
certainly
not
able
to
demonstrate
that
plaintiffs
are
some
kind
of
evil,
as
i
have
already
indicated.
they
have
all
the
attributes
of
every
other
veteran,
and
therefore
there
is
no
reason
to
exclude
them
and
certainly
the
provisions
here
are
not
substantially
related
to
the
exclusion
of
them
from
civil
service.
and
lastly,
if
we
had
a
balancing
test
that
sort
of
looked
at
the
state's
interest
in
restricting
the
right
to
travel
or
burdening
it
versus
the
rights
of
free
interstate
travel
and
the
benefits
to
be
attained
by
that,
new
york's
inability
to
articulate
a
legitimate
state
interest
simply
would
allow
the
scales
to
tip
in
favor
of
equal
treatment.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
the
comment
is
simply
that
this
court's
decision
in
hooper
and
zobel
obviously
indicated
a
doctrinal
difference
between
the
law
at
that
time
and
the
law
as
it
existed--
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
--it
was
not
overruled
explicitly,
that's
correct.
in
conclusion,
new
york
has
no
legitimate
interest
in
benefiting
its
own.
when
plaintiffs
move
to
new
york
they
become
new
york's
own.
it's
the
center
of
our
constitution
that
when
someone
moves
to
a
state,
they
become
its
own
and
prior
residency
cannot
stand
as
a
barrier
for
them
to
be
treated
equally--
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
--let's
say
there
is
a
legitimate
state
interest
served
by
post-residency
requirement.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
well,
i'm
not--
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
--no,
the
state
has--
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
--one,
many
states
have
provisions
which
disallow
that.
if
you
get
the
benefits
in
one,
you
can't
collect
in
another.
but
secondly,
while
i
say
there
is
a
question,
i'm
not
confident
that
this
court
would
agree
with
me.
the
reason
i
say
that
is
in
the
camden
county
case,
the
construction
and
building
trades
council
of
camden
county,
this
court
raised
an
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
limits
on
public
service
jobs
could...
that
excluded
nonresidents
could
survive
a
privileges
and
immunities
challenge.
it
said
it
still
had
to
go
through
the
analysis.
it
didn't
say
it
would
clearly
survive
because
a
state's
interest
in
civil
service
only
being
the
state
civil
service
and
therefore
benefiting
only
its
own
residents,
or
whether
or
not
it
would
not
survive
a
privileges
and
immunities
challenge.
but,
it
said
that
the
question
had
to
be
answered,
and
that's
why
in
terms
of
post-residency
requirements,
there
is
a
question
on
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
which
is
very
distinct
from
the
prior
residency
requirements
we
are
talking
about
and
how
that
really
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
right
to
travel
and
the
heart
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
and
the
equality
of
citizenship
that
comes
from
someone
who
migrates
to
the
state.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
understand
that
to
be
your
question.
the
intervenor
is
a
party
below,
but
let
me
point
out
that
in
the
boston
towncat
case
that
was
the
same
factual
setting.
boston
intervened
in
the
three-judge
bench
decision
involving
the
cornell
steamboat
company,
so
that
they
had
standing
below
as
an
intervenor.
the
question
is
whether
they
can
independently
appeal,
and
that's
the
question
that
this
case
presents,
albeit
in
that
case
there
wasn't
a
clear
statutory
provision
as
there
was
here
under
2403,
but
nevertheless
in
muskrat
despite
a
very
clear
direction
from
congress
in
muskrat
about
jurisdiction,
this
court
found
that
article
iii
did
not...
article
iii
overcame
that...
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
