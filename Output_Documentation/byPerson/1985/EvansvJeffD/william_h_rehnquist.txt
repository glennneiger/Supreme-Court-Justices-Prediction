justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
jones,
do
you
read
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
as
being
limited
to
class
action
situations
where
rule
23
would
apply?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
authority
of
the
district
court
to
supervise
the
settlement
of
something
that
isn't
a
class
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
am
sure
it
could
be
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
district
court.
the
question
is,
what
can
the
district
judge
do
about
it
if
it
is
brought
to
his
attention.
supposing
that
a
sues
b
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
idaho.
it
is
not
a
class
action,
and
the
parties
before
trial
simply
file
a
stipulation
for
dismissal
of
the
case
because
it
has
been
settled.
does
the
district
court
have
any
authority
to
review
that
or
pass
judgment
on
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
looking
into
would
be
for
the
benefit
of
the
class.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
coleman--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
coleman,
i
take
it
that
what
you
are
saying
would
be
just
as
true
of
an
action
brought
under
the
farmers
and
packers
and
stockyards
act,
fair
labor
standards
act,
where
congress
has
provided
for
attorneys'
fees.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
your
brief,
your
response
brief
doesn't
cite
merrick
against
chesny,
which
we
decided
last
june.
in
that
case
we
said
there
is
no
evidence,
however,
that
congress
in
considering
such
in
1988
had
any
thought
that
civil
rights
claims
were
to
be
on
any
different
footing
than
other
civil
claims
so
far
as
settlement
is
concerned.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
repudiated
in
merrick
my
statement
in
delta.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
a
defendant
in
a
case
subject
to
the
1976
act,
if
he
wants
to
concede
a
single
issue
on
the
merits,
is
bound
to
pay
some
attorneys'
fees.
is
that
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
that
the
plaintiff
brings
ten
different
claims,
and
the
defendant
says
i
don't
think
nine
of
them
are
any
good,
but
i
will
grant
you...
i
will
stipulate
to
relief
on
the
10th.
does
that
mean
that
the
court
under
your
view
is
going
to
automatically
be
able
to
award
attorneys'
fees?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
hensley
was
a
case
that
was
tried,
i
believe.
i
am
talking
about
a
case
that
is
settled
before
trial.
