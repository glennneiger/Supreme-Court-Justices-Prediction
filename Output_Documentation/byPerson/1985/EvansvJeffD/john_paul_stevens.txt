justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
question,
too,
mr.
wallace?
you
argue
in
substance
here
that
the
district
court
did
not
abuse
its
discretion
by
approving
the
settlement
as
it
was
tendered
to
it.
would
it
have
been
within
the
district
court's
discretion
to
disapprove
of
the
settlement
within
your
judgment,
simply...
maybe
not
this
particular
one,
but
simply
on
the
ground
that
it
made
no
allowance
for
fees
at
all,
and
that
plaintiffs
obviously
are
entitled
to
something,
and
the
class
has
no
resources
with
which
to
pay
them?
would
that
ever
be
a
permissible
exercise
of
judgment
in
your
view
of
discretion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
assuming
they
are
quite
aggravated.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
short
of
that,
you
say
there
is
never
discretion
to
disapprove
a
settlement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
interrupt
you
with
a
question,
mr.
coleman?
you
asked
what
the
plaintiff's
counsel
could
do.
let
me
ask
you
what
the
defendants
might
do
in
the
situation
in
which
after
the
trial
has
gone
on
for
about
90
days
and
they
investigate
it
carefully
and
they
by
golly
they're
right,
we
should
make
some
changes
here,
and
there
are
$300,000
to
solve
the
problem,
and
the
only
way
we
can
settle
the
case
is
if
we
get
them
to
waive
fees.
if
we
have
to
put
in
$75,000
for
fees,
why,
we
just
can't
settle.
what
should
the
defendant's
lawyer
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
know,
but
i
mean
that
is
the
kind
of
problem
it
seems
to
me
we
have
to
think
about.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
saying
three
months
after
a
complaint
is
filed,
they
study
it,
and
they
say,
we
think
the
best
thing
to
do--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
why
wasn't
the
same
ethical
problem
presented
to
the
plaintiff
lawyer
at
the
first
settlement
proposal
by
the
educational
defendant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
this
were
not
a
rule
23
case,
were
not
a
class
action.
would
the
judge
still
have
the
power
to
approve
settlement
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
an
individual
claim,
three
or
four
people
sued
for
damages
or
injunctive
relief.
justice
john
paul
stevens
a
civil
rights
suit
but
not
a
class
action.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
would
be
the
source
of
the
judge's
authority
to
disapprove
a
settlement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
settlement
is
that
i
will
offer
to
pay...
to
give
something,
buy
a
cadillac
for
your
client,
say,
and
i
won't
give
you
anything
in
fees,
and
they
say
i
will
agree
to
it.
the
client
says,
i
would
rather
have
the
cadillac
than
the
job.
can
the
judge
interfere
with
that
settlement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
no
fees
to
the
lawyer.
no
fees
to
the
lawyer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
the
settlement
agreement
says
in
so
many
words
the
plaintiff
waive
any
claim
to
fees,
and
that
is
a
condition
of
the
settlement.
you
still...
you
say
that
nevertheless
the
lawyer
has
a
suit
for
fees.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
your
position
in
the
class
action
setting,
but
i
have
a
lot
of
difficulty
knowing
how
to
move
from
that
into
the
individual--
