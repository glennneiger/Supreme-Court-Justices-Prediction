mr.
james
thomas
jones
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
am
here
today
to
ask
the
court's
assistance
in
restoring
a
valuable
bargaining
procedure
for
both
plaintiffs
and
defendants,
a
procedure
which
has
been
effectively
denied
to
civil
rights
litigants
in
the
ninth
circuit
by
the
lower
court's
decision.
that
is
the
ability
to
negotiate
attorneys'
fees
along
with
all
other
elements
of
settlement
in
trying
to
secure
the
resolution
of
civil
rights
actions.
this
practical
procedure
which
is
taken
for
granted
in
almost
all
other
civil
actions
and
in
civil
rights
cases
outside
of
the
third
and
ninth
circuits
is
essential
to
case
settlement.
it
produces
a
bottom
line
of
settlement
for
the
defendants,
but
it
also
can
be
a
valuable
bargaining
chip
for
the
plaintiffs.
in
this
case,
the
respondents
waived
counsel
fees
to
obtain
the
benefit
of
a
settlement
which
gave
them,
as
the
ninth
circuit
put
it,
"more
than
the
district
court
during
earlier
settlement
hearings
had
indicated
it
was
willing
to
grant.
"
however,
after
using
the
fee
waiver
as
a
bargaining
chip,
the
respondent's
attorney
appealed
the
fee
waiver
and
the
denial
without
binding
or
even
looking
for
an
abuse
of
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
trial
judge,
the
court
of
appeals
peremptorily
struck
the
fee
waiver
from
the
settlement
agreement,
and
in
the
process
imposed
a
rule
which
virtually
banned
simultaneous
negotiations
of
merits
and
fees.
the
underlying
tone
of
the
opinion
seems
to
hint
that
defense
counsel
were
engaged
in
conduct
that
was
unseemly
or
unethical.
however,
the
record
reflects
that
this
was
simply
not
the
case.
defense
counsel
were
just
doing
their
job
within
applicable
ethical
guidelines.
they
were
trying
to
settle
the
case
in
a
manner
which
served
their
client
agency's
program
goals,
and
at
a
bottom
line
cost
which
their
client
could
live
with.
indeed,
the
trial
judge
specifically
found
that
there
has
been
no
unethical
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
parties.
we
are
here
because
we
believe
the
ninth
circuit
adopted
an
unworkable
approach
which
will
discourage
settlement
of
these
important
cases.
further,
the
entire
decision
wan
based
on
a
faulty
premise
that
special
settlement
rules
apply
to
civil
rights
fee
shifting
cases.
this
court
recently
ruled
in
merrick
v.
chesny
that
no
such
special
settlement
rules
exist,
and
therefore
the
lower
court
ruling
must
be
reversed.
this
type
of
case
presents
a
unique
situation,
because
both
sides
are
generally
interested
in
improving
conditions
for
the
plaintiff
class.
that
is
the
primary
reason
why
the
idaho
department
of
health
and
welfare
agreed
to
provide
more
relief
than
the
trial
judge
had
indicated
that
be
was
going
to
grant,
but
this
willingness
to
provide
additional
relief
was
expressly
conditioned
on
a
waiver
of
attorneys'
fees.
mr.
james
thomas
jones
justice
rehnquist,
i
read
it
as
being
applicable
to
all
situations,
not
only
class
action
cases
but
all
situations.
mr.
james
thomas
jones
well,
under
rule
16,
the
judge
or
the
parties
can
talk
about
settlement,
pretrial
conferences.
i
think
in
that
context
if
somebody
is
being
unfairly
put
upon,
or
if
there
is
unethical
conduct,
i
think
that
the
matter
can
be
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
district
judge.
mr.
james
thomas
jones
i
wouldn't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
the
only
place
where
the
district
judge
really
has
any
place
in
looking
into
a
situation
is
where
there
is
totally
unethical
conduct.
if
there
is
not
unethical
conduct,
if
the
parties
are
operating
within
the
rules
of
the
game,
like
the
people
were
here
on
both
sides,
i
think
they
probably
ought
not
to
become
involved
in
it.
i
think
it
has
just
been
an
accepted
practice
that
the
people,
as
long
as
they
are
acting
ethically,
should
be
able
to
strike
their
bargain
and
negotiate
an
agreement
and
a
settlement,
to
not
have
the
court
messing
around
with
it
and
telling
them,
well,
we
don't
like
this--
mr.
james
thomas
jones
--justice
o'connor,
i
think
it
certainly
would
have
been
ethical.
i
think
we
could
have
offered
them
less
than
they
were
entitled
to
and
a
waiver
of
fees.
they
weren't
obligated
to
take
it.
there
is
no
rule
that
protects
them
from
going
to
court
and
trying
their
case
in
front
of
a
court,
and
as
the
amicus
for
the
other
side,
i
think
the
legal
aid
society
of
new
york
said
they
were
confronted
with
a
situation
where
the
city
of
new
york
sprung
a
fee
waiver
request
along
with
a
settlement
on
the
merits
on
the
eve
of
trial,
and
they
said,
we
took
them
to
trial
and
creamed
them.
we
got
not
only
our
fees,
but
all
the
relief.
and
they
have
that
option
available
to
them.
i
think
that
there
is--
mr.
james
thomas
jones
--i
don't
think
it
should
make
difference
on
the
outcome
of
this
case,
because
that
is
a
matter
between
the
client
and
the
attorney.
what
the
attorney--
mr.
james
thomas
jones
--as
between
the
parties,
see
that
it
alters
the
ethical
arrangements
at
all.
i
think
the
biggest
part
of
the
problem
that
you
have
in
these
cases
is
the
ethical
considerations
between
the
plaintiffs
and
the
plaintiffs'
attorneys,
but
again,
that
is
something
that
has
to
be
resolved
between
them
before
the
state
bar
association.
it
is
not
something
that
ought
to
be
coming
up
in
rule
23
settlement
considerations.
mr.
james
thomas
jones
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
there
has
to
be
an
inquiry
to
make
sure
in
the
settlement
conference
that
the
plaintiff
class
is
not
being
put
upon,
that
is,
this
is
not
some
kind
of
a
sweetheart
deal,
that
they
are
being
shortchanged
on
their
relief
at
the
gain
of
the
lawyers.
i
think
that
has
to
be
looked
into,
but
as
far
as
the
arrangements
that
they
have
for
making
payment
of
the
fee
so
long
as
they
don't
impinge
upon
the
share
of
the
agreement
that
goes
to
the
class,
i
think
you
ought
to
leave
them
to
their
own
devices.
so,
i
think
that
some
inquiry
has
to
be
made
to
make
sure
that
the
rights
of
the
class
are
not
being
impinged
upon,
but--
mr.
james
thomas
jones
--i
think
to
an
extent
you
have
got
to
have
a
little
greater
review
and
make
sure
the
settlement
is
being
fair
to
the
class
as
the
trial
judge
did
here.
the
trial
judge
looked
at
it
at
the
hearing
on
the
settlement
and
said
it
looks
as
if
the
clients
are
being
treated
very
fairly,
said
no
unethical
conduct
in
this
case,
and
i
think
that
is
the
type
of
review.
the
ninth
circuit
said
that
the
judge
did
not
conduct
that
kind
of
review,
or
they
didn't
give
him
credit
for
it,
but
he
did.
he
looked
at
it,
and
he
said
the
clients
were
treated
fairly,
no
unethical
conduct,
so
he
approved
it,
and
i
think--
mr.
james
thomas
jones
--no,
i
don't
question
that.
i
am
saying
that
he
can
look
into
the
fee,
and
he
can
look
into
the
arrangements
so
far
as
they
impinge
on
the
class,
but
other
than
that,
i
don't
know
that
there
is
any
need
to
do
so.
mr.
james
thomas
jones
yes,
to
do
like
the
trial
judge
did
here
and
say,
yes,
this
is
fair
to
the
class.
if
the
plaintiff's
council
took
half
of
the
relief,
then
i
think
that
the
trial
judge
should
look
at
it
very
carefully,
but
that
was
not
the
case
here.
we
are
not
advocating
that
that
should
be
the
case.
mr.
james
thomas
jones
i
see
nothing
wrong
with
the
court
looking
at
that
and
saying,
well,
it
is
justifiable,
we
will
approve
the
settlement,
but
that
is
not
what
happened
in
this
case.
in
this
case,
the
people
got...
the
plaintiff
class
got
more
than
it
was
entitled
to
in
exchange
for
a
fee
waiver.
the
plaintiff's
counsel
appealed.
the
ninth
circuit
said,
well,
this
is
not
acceptable.
we
can't
have
simultaneous
negotiations
of
merits
and
fees,
and
they
struck
the
fee
waiver,
leaving
the
rest
of
the
agreement
in
place,
and
we
simply
don't
believe
that
the
ninth
circuit
decision
which
bans
contemporaneous
resolution
of
case
merits
and
related
fees
except
in
unusual
circumstances
can
be
supported
either
on
legal
or
practical
grounds.
the
rule
is
in
conflict
with
this
court's
holding
in
merrick
v.
chesny.
the
ninth
circuit
based
the
ban
on
a
supposed
congressional
intent
to
apply
special
settlement
rules
in
civil
rights
cases.
however,
merrick
makes
it
clear
that
no
such
special
rules
exist.
in
fact,
civil
rights
cases
are
subject
to
the
same
public
policy
which
favors
settlement,
and
it
is
fairly
clear
from
the
experience
in
the
third
circuit
and
elsewhere
that
this
ruling
is
directly
in
conflict
with
that
policy.
some
commentators
are
concerned
that
simultaneous
negotiations
can
cause
problems
and
soul-searching
for
plaintiff's
counsel,
but
litigation
in
general
has
its
share
of
problems,
soul-searching,
and
heartburn
for
counsel
for
all
parties,
and
offers
of
judgment
which
include
fees
can
cause
all
of
these
same
problems,
yet
this
court
in
merrick
held
that
simultaneous
offers
of
judgment
are
permissible,
and
not
violative
of
any
congressional
intent,
and
the
same
reasoning,
the
same
rationale
ought
to
apply
to
simultaneous
negotiations
between
the
parties.
it
appears
clear
that
the
ninth
circuit
improperly
interpreted
the
congressional
intent,
and
erroneously
banned
simultaneous
negotiations.
it
was
also
based
on
this
mistaken
interpretation
of
congressional
intent
in
section
1988
that
the
court
felt
it
had
the
authority
to
strike
the
fee
waiver
while
leaving
the
rest
of
the
agreement
in
place.
and
we
would
ask
the
court
to
reverse
on
both
grounds.
mr.
james
thomas
jones
certainly,
your
honor,
the
whole
underpinnings
of
the
court's
decision
was
that
there
was
some
special
rule
that
applied
in
civil
rights
cases
which
allowed
the
judge
to
enter
an
order
that
says,
well,
you
don't
negotiate
the
fee
portion
along
with
the
merits
portion.
the
court
specifically
said
that
the
legislative
intent
gives
us
the
ability
to
require
bifurcated
negotiations,
and
the
merrick
case
makes
clear
that
that
is
not
the
case.
another
ground
for
reversal
is
that
the
rule
adopted
below
is
an
unreasonable
deterrent
to
settlement,
and
contrary
to
the
strong
public
policy
in
favor
of
out
of
court
resolutions
of
controversies,
bifurcated
negotiations
place
the
defendants
in
a
quandary.
if
he
settles,
the
settlement
confers
prevailing
party
status
on
the
plaintiff
which
in
turns
subjects
the
defendant
to
attorneys'
fees
even
in
a
frivolous
case
or
a
nuisance
case.
the
present
case
is
even
more
difficult,
because
the
extra
relief
granted
by
the
defendant
could
result
in
greater
liability
for
attorneys'
fees
if
the
respondent
were
to
later
claim
that
he
obtained
an
excellent
result.
if
the
defendant
is
prohibited
from
negotiating
or
even
discussing
fees,
he
can't
properly
evaluate
settlement
options,
and
of
course
defendant's
counsel
is
in
a
quandary,
too,
and
he
is
in
an
uncomfortable
position
because
he
can't
do
an
adequate
job
of
advising
or
counseling
his
client
with
regard
to
settlement.
mr.
james
thomas
jones
they
could
probably
propose
that,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
james
thomas
jones
--i
suppose
it
is--
mr.
james
thomas
jones
--i
think
they
could
propose
it,
but
they
certainly
are
not
in
a
position
to
compel
the
other
side
to
accept
it.
the
other
side
could
say,
that
is
clearly
a
violation
of--
mr.
james
thomas
jones
--well,
i
think
again
there
is
a
difference
because
the
other
side
is
intruding
into
the
arrangement
between
counsel
and
the
party,
and
i
think--
mr.
james
thomas
jones
--well,
the
other
side,
the
defendant
is
not
attempting
to
become
involved
in
the
relations
between
the
client
and
the
party.
i
think
it
would
be
rather
ineffective.
i
think
they
are
in
a
position
where
they
say
they
want
to...
you
know,
you
make
whatever
arrangements
you
want
to.
but
i
don't
see
that
it
has
any
real
effect
on
the
case
that
we
have
here
at
hand.
the
rule
that
was
adopted
by
the
ninth
circuit
doesn't
take
into
account
the
defendant's
need
to
have
a
bottom
line
for
settlement,
and
of
course
this
court
determined
that
that
was
an
important
element
both
in
the
merrick
case
and
in
white
v.
new
hampshire
department
of
employment,
where
this
court
specifically
refused
to
adopt
the
rule
which
was
adopted
in
this
case
by
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
james
thomas
jones
certainly.
there
is
a
conflict
of
interest
any
time
when
there
is
not
enough
money
to
go
around
between
the
client
and
his
attorney,
and
the
people
have
got
to
work
those
out,
those
situations,
day
after
day,
and
i
don't
think
it
is
really
a
problem
that
should
be
presented
to
this
court.
let
them
work
it
out.
mr.
james
thomas
jones
the
problem
is
always
there,
and
they
have
always
got
to
work
it
out
between
themselves,
but
if
we
get
the
ninth
circuit
and
everybody
else
involved
in
the
process,
it
is
going
to
bog
the
courts
down
to
a
point
where
we
won't
be
able
to
get
these
cases
moving
through
the
courts.
mr.
james
thomas
jones
that
is
very
likely
the
case.
those
things
have
to
be
worked
out
between
the
parties
and
their
attorneys.
they
shouldn't
be
worked
out
between
the
court.
the
court
sets
the
rules
and
says
you
can
offer
simultaneous
relief
on
both
the
merits
and
the
fees,
and
i
think
the
court
has
done
its
job.
one
thing
that
i
haven't
mentioned
is
the
fact
that
the
rule
below
will
not
allow
the
use
of
the
fees
as
a
bargaining
chip,
and
it
is
an
important
bargaining
chip.
it
is
a
chip
that
belongs
to
the
plaintiff,
not
his
attorney,
and
he
ought
to
be
able...
the
plaintiff
ought
to
be
able
to
use
it
to
his
advantage.
this
case
is
a
prime
example
where
additional
relief
was
granted
in
exchange
for
that
attorney
fee
bargaining
chip.
there
was
another
case
recently
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
in
the
d.c.
circuit,
a
1985
decision,
moore
against
the
national
association
of
securities
dealers,
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
it
was
proper
to
bargain
away
fees
in
exchange
for
merrick's
relief,
and
the
court
refused
to
follow
the
rule
below
or
the
rule
in
the
brandini
case.
thank
you.
