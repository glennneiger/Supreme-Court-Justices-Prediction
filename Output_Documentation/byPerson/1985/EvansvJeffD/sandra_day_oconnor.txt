justice
sandra
day
o'connor
general
jones,
in
the
class
action
setting
which
i
guess
this
was,
is
it
your
position
that
you
could
ethically
have
offered
the
respondents
complete
relief
on
the
merits
of
all
their
claims?
now,
that
wasn't
what
happened
here,
but
if
you
had
offered
complete
relief
on
all
their
claims
conditioned
on
a
complete
waiver
of
any
attorneys'
fees,
would
that
have
been
ethical
to
propose?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
the
situation
be
any
different
in
your
view
if
there
had
been
an
assignment
agreement
by
the
plaintiffs
below
to
their
attorney
assigning
any
and
all
rights
to
attorneys'
fees
under
section
1988
to
the
attorneys?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
it
alter
the
ethical
considerations
at
all
in
the
propriety
of
making
an
offer
of
settlement?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
jones,
in
this
case
injunctive
relief
was
sought,
but
if
damages
were
sought
in
a
class
action,
and
the
plaintiffs
entered
into
a
contingent
fee
agreement
with
their
attorney,
would
it
be
appropriate
for
the
defendants
to
propose
settlement
contingent
upon
giving
up
the
contingency
fee?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
think
that
is
ethical?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no
interference
with
contractual
relations
or
anything
of
that
kind?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
does
that
differ
from
the
assignment
at
the
outset
of
any
right
to
attorneys'
fees
under
section
1988?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
the
same
be
said
if
there
were
a
contractual
assignment
ahead
of
time
of
any
attorneys'
fees
rights?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
wallace,
do
you
suggest
that
rule
23
in
class
actions
offers
no
source
of
authority
for
the
court
to
make
any
inquiry
under
any
circumstances
and
to
the
appropriateness
of
the
fee
waiver
proposal
in
the
settlement?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
the
circumstances
in
this
case
would
be
sufficient
to
at
least
enable
the
district
court
to
look
at
it
where
it
is
made
on
the
eve
of
trial,
and
only
injunctive
relief
was
sought,
and
the
relief
granted
was
substantial
in
the
settlement.
is
that
enough
to
permit
the
district
court
under
rule
23
to
look
at
it
anyway
at
the
request
of
the
attorneys
on
the
other
side?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
coleman,
to
what
extent
can
the
state
bar
associations
regulate
this
problem
as
a
matter
of
ethics?
i
mean,
why
should
we
place
some
limitation
on
the
ability
to
settle
if
these
ethical
dilemmas
can
be
addressed
appropriately
by
bar
association
requirements
and
regulations?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but,
of
course,
merrick
versus
chesny
rather
undercuts
that
argument,
doesn't
it?
