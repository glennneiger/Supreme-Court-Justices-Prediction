mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
rule
23
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
require
judicial
approval
of
a
settlement
in
a
class
action,
but
that
has
generally
been
regarded
as
protective
of
the
members
of
the
class
rather
than
protective
attorneys'
fees
for
counsel
of
the
class.
congress
could
have
specified
in
the
civil
rights
attorneys
fees
award
statute,
section
1988
of
title
42,
that
reasonable
attorneys'
fees
must
be
awarded
in
every
case,
and
that
this
cannot
be
weighed
in
a
settlement
of
a
civil
rights
case.
it
did
not
so
provide,
but
we
have
assumed
that
the
contention
on
the
other
side
is
based
on
the
proposition
that
in
light
of
the
policies
behind
section
1988
that
statute
should
be
interpreted
as
imposing
a
limitation
on
the
ability
to
waive
or
compromise
fees,
because
otherwise,
as
justice
rehnquist
has
suggested
in
his
questioning,
it
is
difficult
to
see
any
other
basis
on
which
there
can
be
a
rejection
by
the
court
of
a
settlement
the
parties
have
agreed
to
any
more
than
they
would
have
been
required
to
litigate
in
the
first
place.
now,
settlement
efforts
usually
involve
the
art
of
compromise,
and
we
recognize
that
in
the
context
of
fee
award
statutes,
settlement
negotiations
can
present
ethical
difficulties
for
the
plaintiff's
counsel,
not
the
least
of
which
is
the
danger
that
relief
for
the
client's
substantive
claims
might
be
sacrificed
in
favor
of
the
fee
award,
and
our
starting
point
in
this
case
is
that
it
should
not
be
assumed
that
congress
resolved
this
problem,
or
that
the
court
should
resolve
it
by
automatically
placing
the
fee
award
in
the
favored
status
in
which
it
would
be
removed
altogether
from
the
settlement
negotiations,
and
the
plaintiff's
counsel
would
have
nothing
left
to
discuss
compromise
about
except
the
plaintiff's
substantive
claims.
that
is
resolving
the
ethical
dilemma
by
elevating
the
attorneys'
fee
award
to
a
favored
status,
and
in
the
absence
of
direction
by
congress
that
it
intended
to
do
that,
we
believe
that
that
isn't
the
proper
resolution
to
be
assumed.
and
another
important
perspective
in
this
case
begins
with
the
court's
recognition
last
term
in
merrick
against
chesny
that
settlements
would
be
discouraged
if
the
defendants
were
unable
to
make
offers
that
would
extinguish
their
total
liability,
including
their
liability
for
fees,
which
can
be
a
very
sizeable
ingredient.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
our
position,
mr.
chief
justice.
now,
ordinarily,
in
these
settlement
discussions,
the
defendant's
counsel's
ethical
obligations,
and
there
is
more
than
one
counsel's
ethical
obligations
to
consider
here,
the
defendant's
counsel's
ethical
obligation
ordinarily
is
in
negotiations
to
try
to
minimize
his
client's
liability
in
whatever
way
he
can.
and
what
we
caution
against
is
open-ended
ambiguity
about
the
extent
to
which
and
the
circumstances
in
which
the
defendant's
counsel
must
compromise
that
duty
to
minimize
his
client's
obligation
in
favor
of
other
concerns,
because
that
kind
of
ambiguity
would
seriously
threaten
the
viability
of
the
settlement
process
itself,
and
would
lead
to
relatively
routine
efforts
to
invite
judicial
second
guessing
of
the
fairness
of
the
settlement
terms.
in
our
experience,
that
kind
of
second
guessing
really
requires
an
inquiry
which
approaches
a
trial
on
the
merits,
and
if
you
are
going
to
have
that
kind
of
second
guessing,
there
isn't
much
point
in
trying
to
settle
the
case
in
the
first
place.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
don't
go
that
far,
your
honor.
we
don't
think
that
the
arguments
in
this
case
are
limited
to
class
actions
for
the
most
part,
but
we
do
think
that
while
rule
23
is
primarily
concerned
with
protecting
the
members
of
the
class,
one
possible
source
of
concern
is
whether
in
the
long
run
the
members
of
the
class
would
be
deprived
of
opportunities
to
have
their
claims
presented,
and
if
you
had
a
situation
where
there
was
a
vindictive
effort
to
discourage
counsel
from
representing
the
members
of
the
class
by
giving
them
an
offer
that
they
can't
refuse
contingent
on
waiver
of
fees
just
to
teach
counsel
that
they
had
better
not
bring
such
cases,
for
example--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
i
hate
to
say
no.
to
look
at
it
in
the
sense
that
if
an
allegation
was
properly
made
that
came
within
the
standard
this
court
adopted
in
franks
against
delaware,
an
allegation
that
there
was
something
really
improper
here
in
this
offer,
after
all,
the
plaintiffs
were
not
required
to
accept
the
offer.
the
fact
that
it
was
the
eve
of
trial
meant
that
they
presumably
were
ready
to
go
to
trial,
and
a
settlement
negotiation...
our
main
point
is
that
the
court
really
should
minimize
the
extent
of
judicial
cabining
or
intrusion
or
second
guessing
of
settlement
negotiations,
because
it
becomes
a
long
and
unedifying
inquiry
into
who
said
what
to
whom
when,
and
after
all,
the
settlement
is
something
that
both
sides
agreed
to
and
were
not
forced
to
agree
to.
now,
there
are
categories
of
cases
where
the
choices
are
less
difficult
than
they
are
in
this
kind
of
a
class
action
seeking
only
injunctive
relief
where
there
won't
be
any
monetary
award
to
divide
between
counsel
and
his
clients
as
they
see
fit
where
the
clients
aren't
someone
who
can
afford
to
pay
the
cost
themselves,
as
would
often
be
the
case
if
you
had
a
promotion
case
or
something
else
seeking
injunctive
relief.
and
the
situation
is
aggravated
a
little
bit
in
this
particular
case
because
there
is
really
no
guardian
of
the
clients
separate
from
this
lawyer
who
is
representing
them.
he
himself
is
the
guardian...
there
is
no
client
for
him
to
discuss
it
with.
that,
of
course,
is
not
the
defendant's
fault,
and
i
don't
mean
to
criticize
plaintiff's
counsel
for
an
admirable
job
here.
but
this
particular
problem
is
partly
of
his
own
making
in
the
way
he
chose
to
handle
this
case,
but
even
so,
a
judgment
has
to
be
made
on
whether
to
accept
a
settlement
offer
in
light
of
what
he
perceives
to
be
the
strength
of
the
case
and
the
client's
overall
best
interest
not
only
in
the
relief
sought
in
this
case,
but
in
the
possibility
that
future
representation
can
be
secured
for
this
class
of
clients
if
that
becomes
a
serious
problem.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
thought
the
ninth
circuit
rested
its
decision
on
the
impropriety
of
simultaneous
negotiation
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
0
[generallaughter.]
i
will
let
them
shape
their
argument
as
they
see
fit.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
as
they
argue
their
case,
but
they
are
defending
a
judgment
which
addressed
it
on
the
proposition
that
only
in
rare
circumstances
would
simultaneous
negotiation
be
permissible.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
circumstances
in
our
view
would
have
to
be
much
more
aggravated
than
is
shown
or
alleged
here.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
hypothetical
that
i
suggested
would
be
a
vindictive
effort
to
try
to
deny
legal
representation
for
this
class
of
persons
in
the
future
by
giving
them
an
offer
they
can't
refuse
in
this
case
contingent
on
a
waiver
in
order
to
teach
the
attorneys
a
lesson.
that
kind
of
thing--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
don't
see
a
source
of
it,
mr.
justice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
under
rule
23
it
would
have
a
concern
with
whether
the
attorney
was
favoring
himself
as
against
members
of
the
class.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
would
have
to
look
at
the
acts,
your
honor.
the
acts
are
different,
but
in
this
case
congress
made
the
judgment
in
1976
after
two
years
of
investigation
that
there
were
civil
rights
being
violated.
most
of
the
defendants
were
plaintiffs
for
poor
people,
and
they
couldn't
get
counsel.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
true,
but
i
hope
you
would
agree
that
if
the
state
here
had
acted
under
merrick
and
under
rule
68,
filed
this
proposal
as
the
judgment
and
said
no
counsel
fees,
i
think
you,
justice
powell,
certainly
in
your
concurring
opinion
in...
in
a
case,
the
delta
airline
case,
and
you,
your
honor,
would
say
that
an
offer
made
in
a
civil
rights
case
where
all
the
defendant
offered
was
an
injunction,
that
that
would
be
an
inappropriate
offer
under
rule
68,
and
would
not
bring
rule
68,
and
you,
mr.
justice
powell,
said
that
under
those
circumstances
the
court,
if
it
accepted
the
judgment,
would
thereafter
impose
a
regional
counsel.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
so
happened...
well,
it
would
get
to
it...
it
so
happens
that
the
three
organized
bars
that
have
looked
at
the
situation
have
all
said
that
is
inappropriate
in
this
type
of
case
for
the
defendant
to
make
that
type
of
offer.
