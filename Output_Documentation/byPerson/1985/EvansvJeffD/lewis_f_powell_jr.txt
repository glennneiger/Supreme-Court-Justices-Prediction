justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
wallace,
before
you
sit
down,
counsel
for
the
respondent
contends
there
is
only
one
question
properly
before
the
court,
and
that
is
the
waiver
question.
i
take
it
from
your
argument
that
you
believe
the
simultaneous
negotiation
question
also
is
before
this
court.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
have
you
looked
at
respondent's
brief?
of
course
you
have.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
is
a
very
good
brief,
but
doesn't
it
make
the
point
that
only
the
waiver
issue
is
here?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
coleman,
before
you
go
on,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
adopt
a
per
se
rule.
i
agree
with
your
reading
of
the--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--but
it
went
on
to
say
that
the
rule
in
the
ninth
circuit
was
that
there
must
be
a
showing
of
unusual
circumstances
and
then
proceeded
to
find
that
there
were
no
such
unusual
circumstances
in
this
case.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
think
that
would
be
a
proper
rule,
that
there
had
to
be
a
showing
of
unusual
circumstances?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
you
might
have
to,
mr.
coleman,
if
that
issue
also
is
here.
