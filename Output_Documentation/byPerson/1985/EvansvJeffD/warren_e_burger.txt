we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
evans
against
jeff
d.,
et
al.--
mr.
jones,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
attorney
general,
you
said
earlier
that
if
there
are
no
ethical
considerations,
then
the
court
shouldn't
get
into
it,
but
except
as
you
now
suggest
that
the
bar
association
might
get
into
i
later,
how
else
would
the
ethical
factors
be
flushed
out?
you
are
dealing
on
the
one
hand
with
lay
persons
who
are
the
class
and
the
lawyer
on
the
other
hand.
is
there
not
a
disparity
of
understanding
of
the
realities
that
calls
for
some
kind
of
inquiry?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
think
the
situation
would
be
any
different
if
the
class
was
made
up
entirely
of
minors
under
the
age
of...
whatever
the
age
was
of
the
particular
state,
18
or
21?
would
there
be
any
greater
obligation
to
protect
the
class
of
minors
than
the
class
of
adults?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
not
challenging,
then,
the
idea
that
the
trial
judge
who
is
supervising
the
whole
situation
can
appropriately
inquire
into
the
fee?
you
don't
question
that
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
a
rate
case,
for
example,
there
have
been
class
actions
involving
utility
rates.
it
was
won.
whether
reported
accurately
or
not,
i
don't
know.
but
the
average
yield
to
the
numbers
of
the
class
was
said
to
be
$8.58
per
person,
and
the
lawyers
got
$250,000.
on
the
face
of
it,
that
would
seem
shocking,
but
maybe
they
earned
the
$250,000
to
get
$8.58
average
for
$10,000
or
$20,000
or
$30,000
utility
ratepayers.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
our
recent
holding
on
the
rule
68
case
has
any
impact
on
this
situation
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
attorney
general,
something
you
said
there,
if
there
isn't
enough
to
go
around.
even
if
there
is
an
abundance
of
result
to
go
around,
the
ethical
problem
that
is
argued
by
the
ninth
circuit
is
still
present
as
between
the
client
and
the
lawyer,
is
it
not?
that
is
something
they
have
to
work
out
between
them.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
in
merrick
against
chesny,
for
example,
our
rule
68
case,
if
the
ninth
circuit
rule
applied
there,
would
you
say
there
might
not
have
been
a
settlement?
it
might
have
interfered
with
the
settlement.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
attorney
general.
mr.
wallace.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
rule
68
pushes
the
ethical
problem
to
the
extent
that
there
is
one
right
onto
the
plaintiff
and
his
lawyers,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
response
would
mean
that
if
the
court
thought
the
fee
was
grossly
exorbitant,
the
court
would
have
a
function
then
also?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
coleman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
defendant's
offer
in
merrick
against
chesny
was
not
the
way
you
just
hypothesized
it.
it
wasn't
that
we
will
pay
you
$100,000
with
no
attorneys'
fees.
it
was,
we
will
pay
you
$100,000
for
everything,
and
it
is
up
to
you
to
decide.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
have
been
several
suggestions,
including
some
of
our
questions
from
the
bench,
that
this
is
a
matter
for
the
organized
bar
to
deal
with,
but
how
does
it
get
to
the
organized
bar?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
not
talking
about
the
generality
but
the
specific...
some
party
must
bring
the
particular
case
to
the
attention
of
the
bar
association
if
there
is
to
be
an
evaluation
of
the
appropriateness
of
the
particular
case.
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
what
you
are
saying
is
that
the
stipulation
of
the
two
counsel
cannot
foreclose
the
trial
court's
exercise
of
discretion.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
at
1:00
o'clock,
mr.
coleman.
mr.
coleman,
you
may
resume.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
