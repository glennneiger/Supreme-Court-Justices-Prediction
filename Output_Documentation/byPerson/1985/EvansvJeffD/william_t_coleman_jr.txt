mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
basic
issue
here
is
whether
idaho's
settlement
offer
made
just
seven
days
before
trial
which
on
the
merits
gave
plaintiffs
everything
they
had
asked
for
but
demanded
that
they
waive
all
counsel
fees,
created
an
inappropriate
ethical
situation
for
plaintiff's
counsel
and
contravened
the
very
purpose
of
the
civil
rights
act
with
respect
to
fees
of
1976,
which
was
to
provide
fees
to
available
plaintiffs
to
encourage
private
counsel
to
represent
individuals
seeking
to
vindicate
constitutional
rights.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
now,
we
have
been--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
--justice
powell,
i
think,
has
not
repudiated
it,
and
i
think
that
is
clear.
0
[generallaughter.]
i
think
you
can't
read
rule
68,
which
says
that
after
two
and
a
half
years
of
litigation
in
a
case
where
the
plaintiffs
resisted
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
where
they
had
all
this
discovery,
where
they
wrote
a
pretrial
conference
memorandum,
and
the
plaintiff's
lawyer
comes
into
court
on
march
22nd
ready
to
try
the
case,
and
at
that
point
the
state
says,
i
will
give
everything
you
want,
namely,
these
children
who
in
1980
when
this
suit
started
were
placed
in
facilities
with
adults,
many
of
whom
had
been
charged
with
sexually
molesting
children.
the
evidence
makes
it
clear
if
you
look
at
page
64
and
65
of
the
record
that
the
state
didn't
even
have
a
child
psychiatrist.
the
state
admits
that
these
children
being
under
these
conditions
actually
were
worse
off.
it
also
admits
that
if
a
state
had
discharged
its
responsibility
as
you
indicated
that
they
should
in
the
case
out
of
pennsylvania
where
you
held
that
mentally
held
people
had
the
right
to
get
minimum
treatment,
that
under
those
circumstances
these
people
would
have
been
treated.
at
that
point,
when
the
plaintiff
lawyer
who
had
gotten
everything
he
wanted,
and
the
state
knew
when
this
was
suit
was
filed
that
the
plaintiff's
lawyers
could
not
be
paid
by
the
plaintiffs,
they
were
poor,
they
were
indigent,
they
also
knew
there
would
never
be
a
pot
of
money
because
this
was
for
an
injunction
only.
they
also
knew
because
the
idaho
legal
aid
association
gets
federal
funding,
that
under
the
federal
statute
they
cannot
charge
the
plaintiff
a
fee,
but
yet
under
your
cases,
if
you
are
successful,
they
can
get
a
counsel
fee,
and
at
that
stage
what
does
a
lawyer
do?
can
a
lawyer
look
himself
in
the
face
and
say
i
have
gotten
all
the
relief
for
my
client.
if
i
reject
it
and
i
go
to
trial,
even
if
i
win,
it
will
be
two
or
three
months
later.
it
will
be
a
year
and
a
half
on
appeal,
and
my
children
during
that
time
will
continue
to
be
raped--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
--that
didn't
happen
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
what
would
happen
would
be
that
there
would
be
negotiations,
and
if
it
is
a
fact
that
the
state
after
three
months
of
trial
finally
realizes
since
the
day
the
complaint
was
filed
they
were
violating
the
constitution--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
--well,
i
think
the
facts
of
this
case
are
very
interesting.
the
plaintiff's
lawyer
here
was
responsible.
when
the
law
suit
was
filed,
and
there
was
a
claim
against
the
educational
defendants,
those
educational
defendants
acted
just
the
way
you
suggested.
after
all,
they
were
officers
of
the...
they
have
taken
an
oath
to
defend
the
constitution.
they
looked
at
the
facts,
and
they
immediately
said
we
will
settle
and
we
will
give
you
what
you
ordered,
and
at
that
point
the
plaintiff's
counsel
said
i
will
not
claim
a
fee
because
you
acted
responsibly.
on
the
other
hand,
the
mental
defendants
said,
no,
they
resisted,
they
took
you
through
ever
possible
cause.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
that
is...
no
you
have
put
your
finger
on
it,
mr.
justice
stevens.
the
court
below
misconstrued
the
ethical
problem.
the
court
below,
on
page
91
of
the
joint
appendix
says
that
the
ethical
problem
which
it
thought
had
been
put
before
the
court
was
whether
a
plaintiff
when
he
represents...
a
plaintiff's
lawyer
when
he
represents
a
plaintiff
can
say
in
this
case
i
won't
charge
a
fee.
obviously
a
plaintiff's
lawyer
can
do
that.
but
the
ethical
issue
is
just
the
opposite.
can
the
defense
lawyer
under
the
facts
of
this
case
tell
the
plaintiff's
lawyer
i
will
give
you
everything
you
want,
but
you
have
to
give
up
the
statutory
right
which
congress
gave
you.
and
the
plaintiff's
lawyer,
very
responsible,
he
didn't
back
off.
he
said
at
least
put
that
before
the
judge.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
justice
o'connor,
the
problem
is
that
that
does
not
take
care
of
the
part
of
the
case
where
congress
by
statute
has
said
if
you
successfully
settle
the
case
you
are
entitled
to
a
counsel
fee.
the
bar
association,
to
the
extent
they
have--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
--i
would
disagree,
your
honor.
it
is
clear
when
you
real
rule
68
that
if
the
state
had
said,
i
agree
that
the
damages
are
$68,
but
there
will
be
no
counsel
fees,
at
that
point,
i
don't
think
merrick
versus
chesny
would
say
that
case
is
settled.
the
rule
says
you
have
to
make
provision
for
costs
and
now
you,
judge
rehnquist,
and
you,
chief
justice,
have
said
that
includes
counsel
fees
in
a
civil
rights
case.
i
think
there
it
would
not
be
an...
you
wouldn't
have
the
problem.
you
only
have
the
problem
here
because
they
didn't
do
that.
but
once--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
--and
the
court
below
found
that
with
respect
to
that,
that
what
they
got
in...
what...
after
suit
was
$50,000,
and
that
the
counsel
fees
incurred
prior
to
the
time
that
the
offer
was
made
was
only
$32,000,
so
therefore
by
arithmetic
$82,000
is
less
than
$100,000.
in
that
case
the
defendant
had
made
an
appropriate
offer,
but
if
you
had
found
or
the
court
below
had
found
that
pre
the
tendering
of
the
judgment,
that
counsel
fees
were
$100,000,
then
you
would
have
said,
i
hope,
that
under
those
circumstances
that
was
not
an
offer
which
complied
with
rule
68.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
oh,
yes,
but
what
has
happened,
your
honor,
this
has
come
up.
this
is
the
latest
ploy
on
the
part
of
government
to
completely
thwart
civil
rights
lawyers.
you
bring
a
lawsuit.
you
do
all
the
discovery.
if
you
try
the
case,
you
are
going
to
win.
you
are
going
to
be
entitled
to
counsel
fees.
they
then
put
an
offer
before
you
which
says,
i
will
give
you
everything
you
want.
at
that
point,
you
know,
in
brown,
before
that
case
was
argued,
if
the
states
have
said
to
mr.
justice
marshall
i
will
give
you
everything
you
want,
you
will
get
a
decree,
word
for
word
the
decree
entered
in
1955.
at
that
point,
anybody
has
to
say
i
will
take
that,
but
if
in
the
meantime
congress
has
passed
a
statute
saying
that
you
are
entitled
to
counsel
fees,
the
state
at
that
stage
ought
not
to
be
able
to
thwart
the
counsel
fees
by
saying,
but
you
are
not
entitled
to
counsel
fees.
and
i
would
like
to
spend
some
time
talking
about
what
this
case
is
not
about,
your
honor.
this
case
is
not
about
simultaneous
negotiation
of
fees.
i
asked
you
to
read
pages
23a
and
25a
to
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
cert,
where
the
ninth
circuit
case
is
set
forth.
the
judge
says
two
times,
we
do
not
say
that
in
all
instances
simultaneous
bargaining
of
fees
is
improper.
what
we
do
say,
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case
this
ought
not
to
have
happened.
and
justice
o'connor,
i
think
it
is
relevant
that
this
is
a
class
action.
suppose
the
other
thing.
suppose
the
state
said--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
--that's
right.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
and
they
also
cite
a
case
where
they
approved
of
the
fee,
even
though
it
had
been
negotiated
simultaneously.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
no.
well,
i
think
that
is
a
separate
question.
i
would
certainly
say
that's
not
my
case.
i
don't
have
to
convince
you
that
the
simultaneous
rule
is
correct
in
order
to
prevail
here.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
if
that
is
the
second...
if
you
want
to
decide
the
case
on
two
issues,
then
i
will
have
to
go
to
bat,
and
i
would
certainly
say
i
would
urge
you
to
reread
the
briefs
of
the
legal
defense
fund,
the
bar
association
of
new
york,
and
the
other
associations
that
are
involved
in
this
type
of
litigation,
and
they
will
tell
you
that
what
is
happening
today
is
creating
havoc
among
those
that
are
supposed
to
be
representing
in
these
cases,
and
that
this
is
the
point.
the
fact
that
there
are
44
attorney
generals
of
the
states
here,
the
fact
that
the
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states
is
represented
here
demonstrates
that
this
is
a
way
that
the
government
feels
it
can
thwart
the
1976
act.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
actually,
it
was
the
original...
under
these
circumstances,
after
two
and
a
half
years
of
litigation,
this
type
of
proposal,
but
even--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
--not
quite,
your
honor.
even
then,
the
plaintiff's
lawyer
and
indeed
at
that
time
the
defendant's
lawyer
acted
very
responsibly.
if
you
look
at
page
104
of
the
joint
appendix
and
read
paragraph
25,
it
says
this
is
so
if
approved
by
the
court.
when
it
went
before
the
court
below,
with
all
due
respect
to
the
judge,
he
misconstrued
the
issue.
he
says
the
issue
is
whether
plaintiff
is
acting
improper.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
i
would
say
that...
he
could
say
that
and
he
could
say
how
many
hours
have
you
spent,
what
is
your
hourly
rate,
and
he
did
not
make
any...
this
is...
you
give
it
all
up.
this
is
not
a
case
which
says
i
think
you
only
should
get
$10,000,
i
think
you
should
only
get
$25,0000.
this
is
a
case
where
he
says
nothing.
he
says
that
after
two
and
a
half
years
of
litigation,
your
cases
have
held
that
if
you
settle
a
case,
you
are
entitled
to
a
counsel
fee.
and
even
then,
and
i
repeat
this,
he
didn't
just
let
it
stay
there.
he
said,
well,
why
don't
we
put
it
to
the
judge,
and
the
judge
misconstrued
what
was
put
to
him.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
that
is
not
this
case,
your
honor.
i
would
give
you
the
other
case.
i
will
just
asked
you
if--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
--and,
justice
o'connor,
i
read...
because
this
is
a
class
action.
if
the
agreement
had
been
that
the
fee
paid
should
have
been
$25,000,
the
judge
under
the
class
action
rules
would
have
to
look
at
it,
and
the
judge
said,
no,
i
think
the
reasonable
fee
is
$10,000.
the
one
thing
is
clear,
that
the
plaintiff's
lawyer
could
not
say
one
of
those
circumstances,
your
honor,
forget
the
settlement,
i
will
try
the
case.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
we
think
under
the
1976
statute
and
under
the
class
action
rules,
rule
23,
at
that
point
the
federal
district
judge
has
the
responsibility
of
setting
a
reasonable
fee.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
i
think
the
judge
clearly
has
a
duty
to
look
at
it,
and
the
judge
certainly
would
take
into
consideration
that
what...
the
amount
suggested,
but
after
two
and
a
half
years
of
litigation--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
--yes,
it
is
what
they
agreed
to,
that
he
would
consider
that
as
one
of
the
factors,
and
particularly
when
you
consider
it,
as
i
understand
the
cases,
when,
if
it
is
too
much,
the
judge
has
a
duty
to
adjust
it
downward.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
the
1976
act
says--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
--the
answer
is,
your
honor,
i
can
tell
you
what
the
statute
says.
the
statute
says
the
court
may
award,
and
it
is
highly
possible,
and
this
goes
to
a
frivolous
claim.
that
is
the
reason
why
i
just
can't
say
yes
or
no.
if
the
judge
makes
a
determination
that
this
was
a
frivolous
claim,
and
therefore
for
nuisance
reasons
it
was
settled
for
$1,000
or
something
like
that,
then
i
don't
think
the
judge
has
to
pay
the
fee,
but
the
judge
has
to
look
at
it.
he
has
to...
he
or
she--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
--the
court
would
consider
it.
i
am
pretty
sure
the
judge
would
reread
justice
powell's
opinion
in
hensley
which
says
that
you
have
to
consider
the
facts,
and
there
are
12
factors
set
forth
in
those
cases.
justice
powell
has
made
clear
that
if
you
have
six
claims,
you
win
five
of
them
and
lose
on
one,
that
the
court
can
take
that
into
consideration.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
the
case
that
came
out
of
the
second
circuit
which
held
that
you
could
get
counsel
fees
even
though
the
case
was
settled
says
that
you
have
the
right
to
counsel
fees,
and
i
think
that
it
is
something
the
judge
would
look
at.
i
mean,
what
you
are
saying,
your
honor,
if
you
file
the
lawsuit
and
the
day
after
you
file
there
is
a
settlement,
that
obviously
that
is
different
from
a
case
where
you
have
a
two
and
a
half
year
litigation.
it
depends
upon
the
fact,
and
this
court
has
made
it
clear
that
in
each
case
the
judge
has
the
responsibility
of
looking,
and
we
say
here
he
has
the
responsibility
because
of
the
act
of
1976,
he
had
the
responsibility
because
this
was
a
rule
23
proceeding,
and
he
had
the
responsibility
because
paragraph
25
said
that
it
was
subject
to
his
approval,
and
he
misread
his
obligation
at
that
point,
and
he
never
tried
to
prove
the
case.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
i
would
say
that
the
stipulation
of
two
counsel
cannot
completely
foreclose
the
trial
judge's
discretion
in
a
rule
23
case
and
in
a
case
where
congress
has
a
statute
which
specifically
says
that
people
are
entitled
to
counsel
fees.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
if
it
were--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
--is
it
a
civil
rights
suit?
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
under
those--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
--well,
it
wouldn't
come
about
that
way,
your
honor.
what
it
would
come
about,
there
would
be
a
settlement.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
the
judge
cannot...
at
that
point
the
answer
is
no,
your
honor,
but
in
addition--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
--well,
in
addition,
your
honor,
you
realize
that
once
that
happens
your
cases
have
said
at
that
point
there
arises
a
cause
of
action
which
you
never
had
before,
namely,
to
file
a
motion
under
the
1976
act,
and
at
that
time
the
judge--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
--no,
i
don't
know.
i
would
say
that
plaintiff
has
a
suit
under
the
act.
that
doesn't
mean
he
is
going
to
win.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
the
individual
case
is
a
harder
case.
i
have
two
or
three
strings
to
my
bow.
i
lose
one
in
the
private
action,
but
i
still
say
that
what
happens
is...
well,
it
is
quite
clear.
if
they
settle
the
case
privately
and
said
nothing
about
counsel
fees,
it
is
clear
that
under
the
act
of
1976,
you
are
entitled
to
get
counsel
fees.
if--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
members
of
the
court,
this
case
is
not
about
the
defendant's
lawyer
being
able
to
complain
that
he
was
misled
or
that
he
was
mistaken
that
the
plaintiffs
were
not
going
to
make
a
claim
for
a
counsel
fee,
and
contrary
to
what
general
jones
said,
the
plaintiff's
lawyer
could
not
have
rejected
the
fee
and
tried
the
case,
because
he
had
received
in
the
offer
everything
he
would
have
gotten
as
a
result
of
the
trial.
it
is
not
about
privileged
lawsuits,
and
there
are
plenty
of
remedies
to
take
care
of
that.
in
this
case,
the
court
must
apply
the
1976
act
and
the
settlement
in
the
rule
23
context.
in
conclusion,
i
speak
here
in
furtherance
of
the
inherent
decency
in
our
society
which
free
people
worldwide
admire.
despite
over
200
years
of
successes,
there
are
still
poor
people
in
this
country
whose
constitutional
rights
are
violated
who
have
no
resources
to
pay
for
lawyers.
unfortunately,
the
legal
profession
has
not
developed
in
the
tradition
of
abraham
lincoln,
who
as
carl
sandburg
tells
us
in
5.
today's
successful
private
practitioners
often
do
not
devote
any
time
to
representation
before,
who
cannot
afford
to
pay
fees.
congress
recognized
this
problem
in
the
civil
rights
context,
and
opted
to
handle
it
in
a
particular
way.
it
did
not
create
a
governmental
bureaucracy
where
poor
people
could
go
to
have
their
cause
prosecuted
conscientiously
by
a
government
employee.
it
did
not
set
up
a
voucher
system
in
which
the
government
would
pay
the
private
lawyer
win,
lose,
or
draw,
nor
did
it
create
a
system
in
which
the
poor
could
select
a
private
lawyer
and
have
the
government
pay
the
lawyer
if
he
prevail
as
is
the
case
with
the
special
prosecutor's
act
under
which
high
public
officials
get
their
fees
paid
by
the
government
if
they
are
successful.
instead,
congress
placed
the
task
of
representing
indigent
civil
rights
plaintiffs
upon
private
lawyers,
many
of
whom
are
young
and
not
employed
by
the
large
law
firms
who
can
absorb
the
cost.
this
court
must
not
permit
the
states
and
the
federal
government
to
block
their
one
chance
to
receive
compensation
at
the
end
of
a
difficult
litigation.
we
should
admire,
not
penalize
the
lawyers
at
idaho
legal
aid
who
recognize
their
responsibility
to
accept
a
favorable
merged
settlement
rather
than
take
selfish
action
to
protect
their
fees.
it
is
a
sad
day
of
this
court
penalizes
such
ethical
and
gracious
acts,
and
this
is
not
an
issue
that
you
can
leave
to
the
bar
association,
because
for
good
or
worse
congress
has
placed
responsibility
on
the
courts
since
it
enacted
the
act
of
1976.
