justice

r.

mr.
jones,
in
the
typical
contingent
fee
case
where
the
plaintiff's
lawyer
has
taken
the
case
on
a
contingency,
and
his
fee
is
going
to
depend
on
how
much
he
recovers,
i
suppose
that
he
can...
the
defendant
could
surely
propose
a
settlement
to
him,
say
we
will
pay
you
client
x
dollars,
and
if
that
is
x
dollars
whereas
the
attorney
thinks
that
he
will
make
more
money
if
it
is
2x,
he
may
turn
it
down.
isn't
there
almost
the
same
possibility
of
a
conflict
of
interest
in
just
the
typical
contingency
arrangement?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
coleman,
you
say
the
simultaneous
negotiation
isn't
here.
i
take
it
then
that
you
think
it
is
only
the
insistence
upon
a
waiver
of
fees
that
is
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
is
to
waive
your
fees.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't...
i
take
it
you
don't
contend
that
the
defendant's
lawyer
should
not
say
to
a
plaintiff's
lawyer
i
want
to
make
you
an
offer
of
settlement
on
the
merits,
and
also
on
your
attorney's
fees.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
the
defendant's
lawyer
says
here
is
an
offer
on
the
merits
and
here
is
an
offer
of
your
attorney's
fees,
and
they
negotiate
back
and
forth,
and
the
plaintiff's
lawyer
finally
agrees
on
both,
and
then
the
settlement
is
approved,
except
that
the
plaintiff's
lawyer
then
says
it
was
unfair,
it
was
unfair,
it
put
me
in
a
bad
spot,
and
i
think
i
should
have
an
additional
award
of
fees.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
my
case--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
what
if
the
plaintiff's
lawyer
says,
look,
judge,
go
ahead
and
approve
the
settlement
on
the
merits,
but
i
think
i
am
entitled
to
a
hearing
on
what
a
reasonable
fee
would
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
fact
that
the
plaintiff
signed
the
settlement
on
his
fee
should
not
bar
the
judge
from
setting
another
fee.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
more
than
suggested.
it
is
what
they
both
agreed
on.
