mr.
cutler,
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
removal
power
in
the
'21
act
is
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
no,
i
understand
that,
but
it's
a
different
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i'm
just
asking
independently,
would
you
say
the
'21
act
is
constitutional
or
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
in
that
connection,
if
his
task
is
to
review
the
expenditure
of
public
funds,
i
take
it
he
will
perform
that
task
upon
request
by
either
a
congressional
committee
or
an
individual
congressman
or
senator,
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
will
he
do
the
same
thing
upon
the
request
of
the
president?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
same
type
of
investigative
checking
on
disbursements?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
percentage
of
his
work
assignments
do
you
suppose
eminate
from
the
legislature
and
what
from
the
executive?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
over
90
percent,
would
you
say?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
there
some
tension
between
that
suggestion
and
your
earlier
suggestion
that
he's
just
a
guy
with
a
green
eyeshade?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
it
seems
to
me
you
ought
to...
you
have
to
choose
between
those
two
versions
of
what
he
is
doing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
had
to
choose
from
just
three
candidates,
didn't
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
statute
provides
just
three
candidates,
doesn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
he
must
pick
one
of
the
three
suggested.
am
i
wrong
on
that?
maybe
i
read
it
wrong.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
see.
so
i
am
not
wrong.
but
let
me
just
ask
you
one
question.
i
know
the
red
light
is
on,
but
you
said
that
they
could
constitutionally
have
given
this
power
to
the
secretary
of
the
treasury,
but
it
would
have
been,
as
i
understand
what
you
said,
a
political
impossibility,
which
seems
to
me
again
inconsistent
with
the
notion
that
this
is
just
a
factfinding
function.
why
would
it
be
a
political
impossibility?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
there's
some
area
of
discretion
in
finding
facts,
i
guess
that's
what
you
are
saying.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
fried,
you
don't
challenge
the
fallback
position,
do
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
if
this
order,
instead
of
being
given
by
the
comptroller
general,
were
based
on
the
recommendation
of
the
comptroller
general
and
then
enacted
in
a
joint
resolution
of
congress,
that
then
the
president
would
have
to
obey
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
morrison,
it
is
a
fact,
is
it
not,
that
in
this
particular...
the
experience
we
have
so
far,
the
congressional
estimate,
the
executive
estimate,
and
the
comptroller's
estimate
are
all
pretty
close
to
one
another?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
the
fact
that
they
didn't
have
any
consequences,
it
seems
to
me,
would
be
more
reason
to
anticipate
wider
variation
rather
than
coming
close
to
the
target.
i
don't
see
how
that
cuts
any
ice
on
the
way
they
went
about
doing
their
job.
i
assume
they
did
it
conscientiously,
and
they
did
in
fact
come
out
pretty
much
the
same.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
ask
one
question
about
the
removal
power
which
you
regard
as
critical,
as
i
understand
it.
must
we
not
presume
that
if
congress
were
to
exercise
its
removable
power,
removal
power,
it
would
only
do
so
for
a
reason
specified
in
the
statute,
which
would
mean
that
it
could
not
remove
the
comptroller
general
because
they
didn't
like
the
way
he
performed
his
functions
under
this
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
surely
they
could
not
remove
him
for,
because
they
disagreed
with
his
policy
judgments
on
estimating
rates
of
inflation
or
unemployment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
make
the
same
argument
if
he
could
only
be
removed
for
committing
a
felony,
say?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
this
decision
reviewable?
nobody's
told
us
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
the
statute
would
be,
but
the...
but
i'm
concerned
about
the
exercise
of
it.
say
they
said
we
now
determine
he
is
inefficient
or
something.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
sounds
to
me
like
you're
adopting
the
solicitor
general's
argument
that
the
officer
must
be
removable
by
the
president
in
order
to
perform
this
function.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
sounds
to
me
as
though
you
have
adopted
the
solicitor
general's
position
that
this
officer
must
be
removable
by
the
president
in
order
for
the
powers
to
be
delegated
to
him.
do
you
adopt
that?
