justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
cutler,
aren't
we
guided
in
determining
severability
if
some
portion
of
the
statute
is
found
to
be
unconstitutional
by
the
expressed
intent
of
congress,
which
in
this
case
would
indicate
that
congress
had
some
fallback
position
which
it
articulated
should
be
followed?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
aren't
we
reviewing
the
1985
act?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
ross,
wouldn't
you
concede
that
the
historic
role
of
the
comptroller
general
is
really
that
of
an
employee
of
the
legislative
branch,
in
effect?
hasn't
he
been
considered
an
arm
of
the
legislative
branch
rather
than
the
executive
branch,
historically?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
work
does
he
do
for
the
executive
branch
specifically?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
mr.
ross,
you
take
the
position
that
none
of
the
functions
assigned
to
the
comptroller
general
in
the
1985
act
are
executive
functions
in
nature?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
wouldn't
concede
that
there
is
any
executive
power
component
involved
in
the
1985
act
powers
given
to
the
comptroller
general?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
bottom
line,
of
course,
is
picking
a
figure
or
figures
that
will
be
binding
on
all
agencies
of
the
federal
government
for
purposes
of
sequestration,
for
example.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
say
that
these
functions
could
be
given
to
an
executive
branch
officer,
mr.
ross,
under
a
scheme
like
this
with
congress
removal
power?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
these...
you
say
that
the
comptroller
general
is
an
independent
officer,
so
it's
all
right
to
give
him
the
power
that
has
been
given.
could
congress
give
this
power
to
a
purely
executive
branch
officer
having
congress
with
the
removal
power
that
it
has
retained
for
itself
with
this
officer?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
think
that
somehow
the
constitution
provides
for
the
creation
of
these
independent
officers.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
how
do
you
fit
that
doctrine
into
what
we
think
of
as
the
separation
of
powers
concept
that
the
framers
of
the
constitution
had
in
mind?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
the
legislative
branch
has
in
fact
restricted
the
power
of
appointment
of
comptroller
general
to
a
degree,
has
it
not,
by
limiting
the
appointment
to
people
suggested?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
fried,
i'll
confess
you
scared
me
with
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
[laughter]
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
why
don't
you
explain.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
strikes
me
as
kind
of
a
novel
doctrine
you're
espousing,
and
i
can't
quite
put
a
finger
on
that
approach
in
any
of
this
court's
previous
decisions.
and
i
mean,
can't
it
be
said
that
the
federal
reserve
board,
for
example,
through
its
powers
basically
affects
the
financial
structure
of
every
agency
of
the
government?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
you're
correct
is
he
still
an
officer
of
the
united
states
who
must
be
appointed
by
the
president?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
fried,
do
you
say
that
none
of
the
other
powers
of
the
comptroller
general
prior
to
this
particular
act
were
executive
powers
in
essence?
