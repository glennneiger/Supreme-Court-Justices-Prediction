mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
constitutional
interplay
between
two
statutes,
one
passed
in
1921
and
the
other
in
1985.
in
a
larger
sense,
it
involves
the
validity
of
the
concept
of
the
independent
officer
of
the
united
states
first
approved
by
this
court
in
humphrey's
executor,
and
congress
before
and
since
that
time
has
enacted
many
laws
creating
officers
of
the
united
states
duly
appointed
by
the
president
and
confirmed
by
the
senate
who
serve
for
a
fixed
term,
independent
of
presidential
direction,
and
are
not
removable
by
the
president
at
will.
the
1921
budget
and
accounting
act
created
the
office
of
the
comptroller
general
and
assigned
to
him
the
same
functions
previously
performed
by
the
comptroller
of
the
treasury,
an
officer
of
the
executive
branch.
he
was
to
serve
for
a
fixed
term,
and
he
was
to
be
removable
only
for
cause
after
hearing
by
the
passage
of
a
law
to
that
effect.
the
1985
balanced
budget
and
emergency
deficit
control
act
assigned
an
additional
reporting
function
to
the
comptroller
general.
the
comptroller
general's
report,
under
the
'85
act,
determines
whether
congress
has
met
the
specified
deficit
reduction
targets,
and
if
not,
what
reductions
under
a
statutory
formula
are
required
in
order
to
meet
that
target.
the
report
then
triggers
a
presidential
order
which
commands
those
reductions
unless
congress
responds
by
enacting
some
different
law
that
meets
the
target
by
a
different
mix
of
tax
increases
or
deficit
reductions,
or
modifies
or
suspends
the
law
in
its
entirety.
the
district
court
held
that
this
'85
act
function
assigned
to
the
comptroller
general
was
incompatible
with
the
removal
power
granted
to
congress
under
the
1921
act
by
the
enactment
of
a
removal
law
because,
said
the
district
court,
that
removal
power,
even
though
never
exercised,
created
a
here
and
now
subservience
of
the
comptroller
general
to
congress
that
made
it
impermissible
for
him
to
perform
this
reporting
function
under
the
1985
act.
if
the
court
permits,
since
we
have
three
counsel
arguing
for
the
appellants,
we
have
tried
to
organize
our
argument
so
that
i
will
deal
with
the
status
of
the
comptroller
general
under
the
1921
act
and
the
removal
clause--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
--oh,
it
is
a
law.
i
suppose
its
constitutionality
would
be
reviewable
by
the
removed
person
or
perhaps
on
challenge
by
the
president
if
he
had
been
excluded
from
his
constitutional
removal
power.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
i
would
suppose,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
a
removal
by
way
of
impeachment
would...
i
don't
know
whether
it
would
be
judicially
reviewable
by
this
court,
for
example,
as
to
whether
it
complied
with
the
statutory
standards.
it
would
be
a
difficult
point,
particularly
of
the
president,
since
the
chief
justice
would
have
presided
in
the
impeachment,
but
i
believe
certainly
a
removal
pursuant
to
this
statute
by
the
passage
of
a
law
would
be
subject
to
a
constitutional
due
process
or
other
challenge
by
the
removed
person
or
by
the
president
on
the
ground
that
he
has
been
excluded.
in
any
event,
the
power,
as
you
know,
has
never
been
exercised
in
the
65
years
since
the
statute
was
passed.
mr.
ross
is
going
to
deal
with
the
additional
function
assigned
to
the
comptroller
general
under
the
'85
act,
and
mr.
davidson
is
going
to
deal
with
the
additional
argument
rejected
below
that
the
delegation
of
this
'85
act
function
to
any
officer
of
the
united
states,
even
in
the
executive
branch,
would
be
void
for
overbreadth
under
the
delegation
doctrine.
in
reaching
its
decision,
the
district
court
did
not
consider
the
legislative
history
of
the
1921
act
or
the
validity
of
this
1921
removal
provision
within
the
context
of
the
'21
act,
and
we
submit
that
that
was
a
fundamental
error.
the
district
court
declined
to
do
that
because,
it
said,
courts
never
choose
which
of
two
allegedly
incompatible
statutes
to
strike
down,
that
they
always
act
to
strike
down
the
statute
under
which
the
plaintiff
claims
that
his
injury
occurred,
and
in
that
case,
of
course,
this
would
be
the
1985
statute.
but
as
we
have
cited
in
our
briefs,
in
glidden
v.
zdanok,
this
court
did
precisely
the
opposite.
the
court
there
was
dealing
with
an
assignment
statute
authorizing
the
assignment
of
the
court
of
claims
and
customs
and
patent
appeals
judges
to
regular,
other
regular
article
3
courts.
that
was
the
statute
that
allegedly
injured
the
plaintiffs
in
those
cases,
and
the
court,
instead
of
striking
down
that
statute,
which
was
arguably
incompatible
with
earlier
statutes
giving
advisory
jurisdiction,
advisory
opinion
jurisdiction
to
those
two
courts
which
would
interfere
with
their
article
3
status,
decided
that
congress
had
intended
to
make
them
article
3
courts
from
the
beginning,
and
that
if
necessary,
the
objectionable
jurisdiction
provisions
in
the
earlier
statutes
would
have
to
fall.
and
when
the
district
court
thought
it
was
confronted
with
a
similar
problem
here,
we
submit
it
should
have
adopted
the
same
reasoning.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
we
do,
justice
blackmun.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
there
is
no
question
that
in
the
1985
statute
congress
had
a
fallback
provision
if
any
part
of
the
so-called
reporting
function,
using
the
comptroller
general
and
acting
on
the
reports
of
omb
and
cbo,
were
found
unconstitutional,
but
one
would
never
reach
that
issue
if,
by
examining
the
1921
act,
one
had
concluded
that
the
removal
provision
in
the
1921
act
was
itself
unconstitutional
and
a
nullity,
particularly
since
the
time
of
myers
v.
the
united
states--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
--you
are
reviewing
the
1985
act
on
the
ground
that
a
presumptively
constitutional
provision
in
the
1921
act
is
incompatible
with
the
delegation
of
functions
under
the
'85
act.
if
that
presumptively
constitutional
provision
which
has
been
used
as
a
sword
to
strike
down
the
1985
act
is
found
to
be
unconstitutional
on
its
face,
or
found
on
the
other
hand
not
to
create
a
here
and
now
subservience
to
congress
with
respect
to
the
many
administrative
or
executive
functions
being
performed
by
the
comptroller
general
under
the
1921
act,
then
you
would
have
to
conclude
that
the
'21
provision
is
a
nullity
and
that
it
should
not
interfere
in
any
way
with
the
validity
of
the
delegation
functions
under
the
'85
act.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
it
would
leave
it,
i
would
submit,
justice
rehnquist,
it
would
leave
the
1921
statute
silent
on
removability.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
and
then
under
this
court's
decision
in
wiener,
if
you
concluded
that
the
'21
statute
had
created
the
comptroller
general
as
an
independent
officer
of
the
united
states
serving
for
a
fixed
term
of
years,
you
would
imply
that
the
president
had
no
right
to
remove
him
at
will
but
might
have
a
right
to
remove
him
for
cause,
something
this
court
has
implied
in
the
absence
of
statutory
language
but
not
held.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
if
you
concluded
that
he
were
a
purely
executive
officer,
that
would
be
the
case,
yes.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
i
would
submit
not,
justice
rehnquist
because
congress
clearly
intended
in
the
1985...
the
1921
act
to
establish
the
comptroller
general
as
an
independent
officer
of
the
united
states
because
he
was
to
receive
these
administrative
functions,
like
settling
the
government's
account,
bringing
suits
to
collect
the
government's
claims,
and
setting
the
accounting
standards
for
the
government.
the
whole
argument
about
the
1921
act,
president
wilson's
veto,
the
arguments
that
were
made
to
the
court
in
myers
about
the
'21
act
were
all
premised
on
the
assumption
that
the
comptroller
was
an
independent
officer
of
the
united
states.
during
the
debate
on
an
attempt
to
override
president
wilson's
veto,
which
asserted
the
ground,
among
others,
that
he
had
the
sole
power
to
remove
an
officer
of
the
united
states
when
he
was
given
the
power
to
appoint,
and
that
congress
could
not
take
part
in
the
process,
the
whole
argument
which
was
adopted
by
the
court
in
myers
is
based
on
the
premise
that
he
is
an
independent
officer
of
the
united
states
and
not
an
officer
of
congress
as
the
solicitor
general
is
urging
before
you
today,
in
contrast
to
what
the
solicitor
general
in
the
myers
case
urged.
he
said
the
comptroller
general
was
an
executive
officer.
but
when
the
veto
provision
was
up
to
be
overridden,
the
question...
and
the
override
failed...
the
question
was
asked
on
the
floor
of
the
house,
what
if
we
override,
and
then
president
wilson's
veto,
or
his
position
is
upheld
by
the
courts,
would
the
entire
act
fall,
and
the
answer
was
that
that
was
a
remote
possibility
and
that
if
any
part
of
the
act
fell,
to
that
extent,
the
act
would
be
unconstitutional.
so
we
would
read
that
as
indicating
that
congress
would
have
preferred
to
have
an
independent
comptroller
general
serving
for
15
years
even
if
the
president
had
a
right
of
removal,
and
as
we
know
later
from
wiener,
his
right
of
removal
in
those
circumstances
would
be
limited
to
removal
only
for
cause.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
that
is
correct.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
the
district
court
never
reached
that
argument.
the
district
court
assumed
that
he
was
an
officer
of
the
united
states
and
that
the
functions
were
executive
functions--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
--i
would
think--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
--i
think
it
would,
justice
white.
i
think
the
solicitor
general
is
arguing
that
should
you
conclude
that
a
power
to
remove
for
cause
does
not
create
here
and
now
subservience
to
the
removing
authority,
which
is
in
effect
what
was
held
in
humphrey,
but
the
president
had
the
power
to
remove
for
cause,
and
you
still
held
that
the
federal
trade
commission
was
independent
of
the
president,
then
the
solicitor
general,
i
take
it,
would
fall
back
on
the
argument
that
these
particular
functions
are
within
the
heart,
the
core
of
the
executive
power.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
yes.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
on
that
argument,
they
could
be
performed
only
by
a
purely
executive
officer.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
on
that
ground,
yes,
we
think
you
would
then
take
over
the
side
with
you
the
federal
reserve
board
which
itself
makes
broad,
predictive
findings
of
fact
and
sets
policy,
the
federal
communications
commission
which
you
have
held
determines
the
course
of
future
public
policy
when
it
is
issuing
licenses
and
deregulating
common
carriers,
and
many
other
commissions.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
it's
a
more
sweeping
doctrine,
but
should
you
adopt
that
doctrine,
it
would
have
very
serious
implications
for
all
of
those
agencies.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
i
would...
yes,
justice
white,
if
the
solicitor
general
is
correct
in
that
contention,
then
all
the
independent
agencies
except
those
which
are
limited
to
deciding
particularized
cases
based
on
past
facts,
what
he
calls
a
quasi-judicial
function,
would
be
over
the
side,
particularly
if
you
adopt
his
theory
that
it
is
not
the
removal
power
in
those
statutes
which
would
have
to
be
invalidated
but
the
function
that
is
to
be
performed.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
this
is
the
only
officer
of
the
united
states
who
by
statute,
justice
powell,
is
removable
by
the
congress.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
that
is
so,
for
cause,
that
is
right,
other
than
impeachment.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
the
federal
reserve
board
members
are
removable
for
cause,
under
their
statute,
a
term
that
is
not
defined.
we
have
assembled
in
an
appendix
to
our
reply
brief
the
removal
provisions
and
the
statutory
characterization
of
the
functions
of
every
important
independent
agency.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
we
argue
that
it
is
not
unconstitutional,
justice
stevens,
because
they
never
exercise
power
to
remove
for
cause,
which
is
so
difficult
to
apply
and
has
never
happened.
even
the
president
has
never
removed
an
independent
officer
for
cause
in
a
hundred
years.
we
argue
it
doesn't
create
a
here
and
now
subservience
on
the
authority--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
--right.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
if
you
asked
me,
i
would
have
great
difficulty
defending
the
portion
of
the
'21
act
which
gives
congress
a
role
in
the
actual
removal
process
because
that
seems
to
fly
in
the
face
of
the
ruling
of
myers
which
was
not
affected
by
humphrey's
executor
that
congress
cannot
participate
in
the
actual
process
of
removal
although
it
may
lay
down
the
standards
for
removal.
if
that
happened,
i
would
say,
as
i
did
in
response
to
the
other
question,
that
removal
provision
is
a
nullity
and
has
been
since
the
beginning.
it
is
perhaps
an
open
question
for
this
court
whether
humphrey's
limitation
of
myers
to
independent
officers
reaches
the
portion
of
myers
that
relates
to
participation
of
the
congress
in
the
removal
process,
but
should
you
conclude
congress
cannot
participate
in
the
removal
process,
that
provision
is
a
nullity.
it
is
as
if
it
never
existed.
and
as
to
severance,
justice
o'connor,
if
i
may
return
to
that
for
just
a
moment,
in
the
myers
case
itself,
the
court
was
considering
a
statute
that
authorized
the
president
to
appoint
and
remove
postmasters
of
various
classes
by
and
with
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate.
it
also
provided
for
the
salaries
of
postmasters
and
assigned
them
various
functions.
the
court
in
myers
struck
down
the
removal
provision.
it
didn't
stop
the
president
from
appointing
postmasters,
it
didn't
stop
postmasters
from
delivering
mail,
and
there
was
no
so-called
severance
clause
in
that
statute.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
we
would
defend
its
validity
perhaps
with
less
enthusiasm
than
our
colleagues,
but
i
think
we
all
come
to
the
same
place.
we
all
think
that
the
removal
provision
can
be
upheld
because
it
does
not
create
a
here
and
now
subservience.
but
we
also
think
if
it
does
create
such
a
subservience
or
if
congress
per
se
cannot
participate
in
the
removal
process,
this
removal
provision
has
been
a
nullity
since
1921,
and
it
should
not
affect
your
consideration
of
the
1985
act.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
i
am
suggesting,
chief
justice
burger,
that
the
removal
provision
either
creates
no
subservience,
in
which
case
it
can
have
no
effect
on
the
'85
act
except
on
the
solicitor
general's
extreme
theory,
or
that
it
is
unconstitutional
and
has
been
a
nullity
since
1921.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
with
respect
to
what
the
solicitor
general
has
said
about
the
comptroller
general
being
an
officer
of
congress,
i
do
not
believe
that
has
been
the
consistent
position
of
the
executive
or
congress.
if
the
comptroller
were
a
mere
officer
or
agent
of
congress,
congress
could
have
appointed
him
himself...
itself.
congress
decided
that
it
had
to
be
an
appointment
by
the
president
with
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate
because
the
comptroller
was
to
perform
some
executive
or
administrative
functions.
there
would
have
been
no
point
to
president
wilson's
veto,
what
could
he
have
vetoed,
in
the
congress
reserving
to
itself
the
power
to
remove
an
officer
or
agent
of
the
congress.
solicitor
general
beck
argued
in
the
myers
case
that
the...
this
very
removal
provision
was
unconstitutional
because
the
solicitor
general
was
an
officer
of
the
executive
branch.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
the
comptroller
general.
we
are
all
making,
that
mistake,
sir.
the
present
solicitor
general
is
arguing
to
you
that
this
removal
provision
is
constitutionally
objectionable
in
its
own
right.
how
could
that
be
so
if
the
comptroller
general
were
a
mere
officer
or
agent
of
congress?
in
the
mid-seventies,
congress
considered
reserving
the
appointment
of
the
comptroller
general
to
itself,
and
the
representative
of
the
office
of
legal
counsel
went
to
congress
and
testified
you
can't
do
that.
congress
is...
the
comptroller
general
is
performing
executive
functions,
and
he
must
be
appointed
by
the
president.
and
in
1979,
the
office
of
legal
counsel
published
an
opinion
to
the
effect
that
the
conflict
of
interest
laws
apply
to
the
comptroller
general
and
the
gao
as
an
independent
agency.
in
the
buckley
case,
this
court
in
a
footnote
noted
that
the
comptroller
general,
despite
his
appellations,
could,
as
an
arm
of
congress
that
occasionally
happened,
he
could
perform
administrative
functions
which
he
was
allowed
to
perform
under
an
earlier
version
of
the
campaign
act,
campaign
financing
act.
and
if
you
will
remember,
in
springer,
which
is
twice
quoted
by
this
court
in
buckley,
even
if
the
comptroller,
let
us
say,
were
an
independent
agency
within
the
legislative
branch,
as
you
once
characterized
him
in
passing,
justice
o'connor,
springer
says
that
an
officer
appointed
by
the
legislature
cannot
perform
an
executive
function,
but
the
case
might
be
different
if
that
officer
were
appointed
by
the
president,
by
the
executive,
the
president
of
the
united
states.
the
solicitor
general
has
made
much
of
the
fact
that
the
order,
the
report
the
comptroller
issues
under
the
'85
act
is
to
be
binding
on
the
president.
you
will
recall
that
in
nixon
v.
fitzgerald,
the
civil
service
commission
had
ordered
the
reinstatement
of
mr.
fitzgerald,
even
though
the
president
himself
was
involved
in
removing
him
from
office,
and
mr.
fitzgerald
brought
a
lawsuit
to
enforce
his
right
to
reinstatement,
and
that
lawsuit
was
finally
settled
by
the
executive
branch,
and
he
was
given
back
his
old
job.
moreover,
i
would
submit
that
if
the
president
has
a
constitutional
objection
to
issuing
the
order
after
the
comptroller
general
issues
his
report,
he
has
recourse
under
the
judicial
review
provisions
set
forth
in
section
274(d)(2)
of
the
act
which
speaks
of
the
president
issuing
a
different
report,
order,
than
the
one
that
is
supposedly
required
by
the
comptroller
general's
report
on
the
claim
or
defense
that
it
infringes
on
his
constitutional
prerogatives.
and
that
issue
is
then
resolved
by
the
courts.
severance
of
the
removal
provision
seems
to
have
become
a
critical
issue
in
the
case,
and
i
would
submit
that
myers
is
the
square
precedent.
myers
severed
the
removal
part
of
a
statute
relating
to
the
appointment
and
removal
of
postmasters.
the
president
was
allowed
to
go
right
on
appointing
the
postmasters,
and
their
functions
were
not
changed
in
any
respect.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
well,
we
would
submit,
justice
rehnquist,
that
congress
considered
in
the
debates
about
the
override
in
1920
whether
if
they
overrode
and
then
the
removal
provisions
were
later
held
invalid
by
this
court,
would
the
rest
of
the
statute
fall,
and
the
floor
leader
in
the
house
said
he
thought
not.
he
said
that
it
would
fall
only
to
the
extent
that
the
statute
might
be
held
invalid.
in
senator
howard
baker's
brief,
he
suggested
to
the
court
that
this
may
be
the
last
chance
for
a
statutory
solution
of
this
terrible
budget
deficit
problem
which
is
a
growing
cancer
and
may
soon
become
inoperable.
it's
an
example
of
how
congress,
dealing
with
a
problem
that
arguably
belonged
to
both
branches,
chose
this,
to
repeat
again
this
experiment
of
using
the
independent
officer
of
the
united
states.
it
is
very
important
in
the
history
of
this
country
and
its
development
of
being
able
to
deal
with
the
complexities
of
modern
government
that
this
court
has
not
struck
down
the
notion
of
the
independent
officer
duly
appointed
by
the
president.
