mr.
steven
r.
ross
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
appear
here
this
morning
on
behalf
of
the
speaker
and
bipartisan
leadership
group
of
the
united
states
house
of
representatives.
my
argument
will
proceed
in
the
following
fashion:
first
i
will
try
to
describe
the
functions
given
to
the
comptroller
general
under
the
1985
act.
secondly,
i
will
describe
the
history
and
the
necessity
for
his
choice
to
perform
those
functions.
and
then
finally,
i
will
turn
to
the
question
of
the
constitutional
appropriateness
of
that
choice.
the
1985
act,
emergency
deficit
control
act,
proceeds
from
a
simple
proposition.
that
proposition
is
to
set
statutory
targets
which
in
a
declining
basis...
which,
when
met
will
result
in
a
balanced
budget
by
1991.
to
meet
these
deficit
target
figures
a
simple
process
is
established.
that
process
calls
for
certain
calculations.
those
calculations
start
with
economic
projections
and
then,
using
those
economic
projections,
a
forecast
of
the
projected
deficit,
and
then
using
that
projected
deficit,
comparing
it
to
the
statutory
target
figure,
a
determination
of
the
shortfall,
and
then
applying
the
statutory
formula,
arriving
at
how
to
meet
that
shortfall
from
taking
money
from
each
account.
in
making
these
calculations,
the
comptroller
general
is
performing
functions
similar
to
the
functions
that
he
has
always
performed.
he
makes
accounting
determinations
with
respect
to
the
federal
budget.
it
is,
in
essence,
a
pre-audit,
telling
federal
paymasters
and
disbursing
officers
how
much
money
they
will
have
to
spend.
the
district
court
accurately
described
these
calculations
as
the
application
of
law
to
present
and
future
facts.
equally
accurate,
but
more
colorful,
was
judge
scalia's
description
in
oral
argument
that
what
this
job
was
was
something
for
a
man
with
a
green
eyeshade,
that
it
was
an
accountant's
job,
not
power.
the
district
court
correctly
concluded
that
the
comptroller
general
is
not
responsible
for
a
single
policy
judgment
under
the
act.
next
let
me
turn
to
the
necessity
for
having
the
comptroller
as
the
impartial
budget
scorekeeper,
and
why
he
was
chosen.
when
the
proposal
first
originated
in
the
senate,
these
calculations
which
were
always
part
of
the
proposal
were
to
be
performed
jointly
by
the
president's
office,
omb,
and
by
the
congressional
budget
office.
when
that
proposal
reached
the
house,
it
was
not
surprising
that
the
house
chose
not
to
entrust
these
functions
to
omb
whose
director,
of
course,
shares
office
space
with
the
president.
instead,
the
house
chose
to
give
these
functions
to
the
nonpartisan
cbo,
or
congressional
budget
office.
since
the
director
of
the
congressional
budget
office
is
appointed
not
by
the
president
but
by
the
congress,
there
were
those
who
raised
problems
with
this
proposal.
the
proposal
was
then
made
on
the
floor
of
the
house
by
leaders
of
both
parties,
representative
gephardt,
a
member
of
the
democratic
leadership,
and
representative
cheney,
a
member
of
the
republican
leadership,
that
in
order
to
ensure
that
these
calculations
are
walled
off
from
any
possible
manipulation,
that
they
be
given
to
the
independent,
long-tenured
comptroller
general.
as
the
proposal
bounced
back
and
forth
between
the
senate
and
the
eventual
conference,
this
proposal
was
eventually
enacted,
and
these
functions
were
given
to
the
comptroller
general.
although
the
bill
had
many
detractors
and
many
concerns
were
raised
about
it,
at
no
time
did
these
detractors
raise
any
concerns
over
the
role
of
the
comptroller
general,
nor
did
the
president
raise
any
constitutional
concerns
over
the
role
of
the
comptroller
general.
the
choice
of
the
comptroller
was
consistent
with
two
recent
judicial
decisions
in
which
district
courts
had
determined
in
the
face
of
the
challenge
by
the
executive
that
the
comptroller
could
be
given
important
administrative
tasks
because
he
was
an
independent
officer.
the
selection
was
also
a
recognition
of
the
historic
role
of
the
comptroller,
and--
mr.
steven
r.
ross
--he
has
been
called
by
those
in
congress
and
those
in
the
judiciary
many
things
over
the
years.
he
was...
and
it
is
not
the
nature...
it's
the
nature
of
the
function
rather
than
the
label
that
is
given
to
him
that
should
apply.
his
function
was
historically
first
performed
in
the
united
states
by
a
comptroller
within
the
treasury
department.
when
james
madison
urged
the
first
congress
to
create
such
an
office,
he
specifically
alluded
to
the
importance
that
such
an
office
had
a
unique,
independent
status,
and
in
fact,
urged
that
the
tenure
be
given
would
be
one
which
would
make
him
accountable
to
the
public
generally,
and
so
that
while
over
the
years
the
comptroller
has,
for
example,
been
funded
in
certain
years
out
of
the
legislative
branch
appropriations
and
in
other
years
out
of
executive
branch
appropriations,
i
don't
believe
that
is
the
key.
the
function
of
the
comptroller,
which
is
checking
the
expenditures
from
the
public
purse,
has
always
been
considered
one
that
is
necessary
to
be
performed
by
an
independent
officer.
mr.
steven
r.
ross
to
the
congress?
mr.
steven
r.
ross
the
comptroller,
as
many
people,
provides
congress
with
information.
it
is
well
within
the
purview
of
congress'
power
to
require
opinions
as
to
constitutionality
or
as
to
investigations
from
many
officers
throughout
the
government.
clearly,
if
the
congress
wanted
to,
it
could
require
that
commissioners
of
the
ftc
come
up
and
give
opinions.
mr.
steven
r.
ross
i
was
going
to
answer
that
the
congress
calls
the
comptroller
so
often
because
they
respect
his
competency.
mr.
steven
r.
ross
he
will
perform
various
investigative
functions
upon
request
of
congressional
committees
or
individual
members.
mr.
steven
r.
ross
yes,
he
does.
he
performs
various
functions
for
the
executive
branch.
mr.
steven
r.
ross
he
would
not
issue
the
same
type
of
report,
but
he
does
do
work
for
the...
for
executive
agencies.
mr.
steven
r.
ross
i
think
the
figures
that
i
last
saw
indicate
that
he
does
a
great
deal
of
his
work
for
the
legislative
branch,
over
50
percent,
but
i
don't
think
it
is--
mr.
steven
r.
ross
--i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
steven
r.
ross
he
performs
certain
audit
functions
at
the
request
of
executive
agencies
who
want
to
rely
on
his
expertise.
my
third
point
is
the
constitutional
appropriateness
of
the
selection
of
a
comptroller
general.
as
our
brief
and
as
counsel
for
the
comptroller
have
pointed
out,
a
long
line
of
cases
in
this
court
uphold
the
nature
of
independent
agencies
performing
administrative
tasks.
we
learn
from
humphrey's
executor,
wiener
and
buckley
that
these
tasks
can
be
given
to
an
independent
officer
so
long
as
that
officer
is
appointed
by
the
president,
as
the
comptroller
general
is.
in
challenging
the
independence
of
the
comptroller,
the
executive
fails
to
cite
specific
constitutional
provisions
which
the
1985
act
or
the
1921
act
violate.
that
is
because
there
are
none.
mr.
steven
r.
ross
we
take
the
position
that
none
of
the
functions
given
to
the
comptroller
in
the
1985
act
are
purely
executive
as
that
term
has
been
used
by
this
court,
in,
example,
in
myers
or
as
that
term
was
understood
in
the
first
congress
in
respect
to--
mr.
steven
r.
ross
--well,
clearly,
the
economic
projections
are
a
function
which
are
performed
by
all
three
branches
on
a
daily
basis.
it
is
the
finding
of
future--
mr.
steven
r.
ross
--well,
of
course,
the
figure
is
determined
by
the
statutory
formula.
the
fact
that
the
comptroller's
findings
will
be
binding
is
consistent
with
the
way
this
court
described
the
role
of
the
comptroller
general
in
skinner
&
eddy
in
1927
when
justice
brandeis
observed
that
the
findings
of
the
comptroller
general
were
binding
on
the
executive
branch
it
is
not
a
new
function
for
the
comptroller
to
do.
instead
of
relying
on
specific
textual
provisions,
the
solicitor's
attack
on
the
statute
calls
into
question
an
area
which
justice
stevens
has
recently
aptly
described
as
one
of
those
vast
open
spaces
in
the
text
of
the
constitution
which
was
left
by
the
framers
to
be
filled
in
by
future
generations
of
lawmakers.
in
light
of
this
constitutional
silence,
this
court
should
be
especially
wary
of
overturning
an
important
statute
arrived
at
by
important
compromise
between
the
political
branches.
that
is
particularly
true
since
the
president
is
not
without
weapons
in
fighting
for
these
open
spaces,
namely,
his
participation
in
the
legislative
process
and
his
well-advertised
veto
pen.
the
solicitor
also
raises
a
number
of
specific
concerns
with
regard
to
the
solicitor
general's
choice.
he
says
that
these--
mr.
steven
r.
ross
--excuse
me.
yes.
with
regard
to
the
comptroller
general's
performance
of
these
functions.
he
says
that
these
functions
are
purely
executive,
but
as
i
have
indicated,
these
functions,
predicting
present
and
future
facts
and
making
economic
calculations
and
mathematical
determinations,
are
the
type
of
functions
which
have
traditionally
been
given
to
independent
agencies.
the
solicitor
tries
to
draw
support--
mr.
steven
r.
ross
--the
predictive
nature
of
his
task?
mr.
steven
r.
ross
well,
i
guess
it
would
depend
on
whether...
and
the
description
was
judge
scalia's...
whether
judge
scalia
viewed
accountants
as
doing
any
predictive
factfinding.
determining
what
the
economy
will
look
like
in
three
months,
six
months,
nine
months
or
a
year
is
still
essentially
a
finding
of
fact.
it
is
not
a
finding
of
fact
which
is
reliable
as
finding
present
day
facts,
but
it
is
still
a
finding
of
fact.
as
i
said,
these--
mr.
steven
r.
ross
--the
president
seeks
to
articulate
his
choices
for
national
policy
by
making
political,
practical
and
policy
determinations
as
to
how
much
of
the
federal
purse
should
be
spent
in
various
areas
and
where
that
money
should
be
derived
from.
the
comptroller
performs
no
function
even
vaguely
similar
to
that.
what
the
comptroller
does
is
take
that
budget
as
it
is
proposed
by
the
president
and
enacted
by
the
congress
and
then
applies
the
statutory
formula
to
reduce
expenditures
in
the
event
that
the
congress
has
not
met
the
target.
mr.
steven
r.
ross
no,
it
does
not
alter
in
a
single
area
any
policy
judgment.
i
think
the
district
court
correctly
concluded
that
the
comptroller
is
not
given
a
single
policy
judgment,
and
that
is
the
major
difference.
the
purely
executive
function
of
proposing
the
budget
or
proposing
legislation
involves
policy
choices.
the
comptroller's
function
and
the
administrative
task
is
simply
the
application
of
the
statutory
formula
to
come
up
with
the
bottom
line
numbers.
mr.
steven
r.
ross
right,
that
he
may
perform
these
functions
constitutionally
and
that
the
nature
of
his
tenure,
being
appointed
by
the
president
in
strict
accordance
with
this
court's
decision
in
buckley,
and
the
fact
that
the
removal
mechanism
is
for
removal
by
enactment
of
a
statute
using
the
proper
statutory
enactment
process
required
by
this
court's
decision
in
chadha
do
not
deprive
him
of
the
independent
status.
it
does
not
give
the
comptroller
either
de
facto
or
de
jure
subservience
to
the
congress
or
to
the
president.
in
fact,
he
enjoys
a
degree
of
independence
which
is
unique
among
officers
of
the
united
states,
but
is
exactly
what
both
the
first
congress
had
in
mind
and
is
exactly
what
the
legislators
in
1921
had
in
mind
in
creating
this--
mr.
steven
r.
ross
--yes,
i
do.
i
think
it
is--
mr.
steven
r.
ross
--right.
i
believe
that
it
is...
congress
and
the
president
can
choose
under
the
doctrines
of
the
constitution
and
this
court
to
give
these
types
of
functions
to
independent
officers.
we
also
believe
that
the
comptroller
general
is
an
independent
officer
by
virtue
of
both
his
appointment
and
the
protected
nature
of
his
tenure.
mr.
steven
r.
ross
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
the
question.
could
the
congress--
mr.
steven
r.
ross
--okay,
let
me
answer
that
in
two
ways.
i
don't
believe
that
the
congress
could
enact
a
statutory
removal
mechanism
that
provides
for
removal
by
public
law
for
a
purely
executive
officer.
so
that
is
the
second
part
of
your
question.
as
to
the
first
part,
congress
and
the
president
in
the
legislative
process
could
have
chosen
to
give
this
function
to
the
secretary
of
the
treasury.
i
think
that
would
have
been
a
political
impossibility.
mr.
steven
r.
ross
it's
more
that
the
constitution
doesn't
prevent
it,
and
that
where
the
constitution
does
not
specifically
prevent
the
political
branches
from
utilizing
a
particular
mechanism,
this
court
owes
deference
to
the
choices
of
those
political
branches.
mr.
steven
r.
ross
well,
personally
i
don't
believe
that
each
and
every
function
of
the
government
or
each
and
every
officer
of
the
government
need
be
neatly
pigeonholed
into
a
label
of
either
being
executive,
judicial
or
legislative;
that
i
would
agree
with
the
description
that
james
madison
gave
in
federalist
no.
37
that
there
are
times
that
these
functions
do
not
permit
such
easy
labeling.
and
so
i
think
that
because
the
constitution
does
not
require
that
the...
that
there
be
an
officer
labeled
as
either
executive,
judicial
or
legislative,
that
as
long
as
those
requirements
which
are
contained
within
the
constitution
are
met,
that
separation
of
powers
is
properly
protected.
here,
the
protection
which
the
court
has
clearly
defined
as
recently
as
the
buckley
case,
is
that
the
power
of
appointment
which
is
specifically
described
in
the
text
of
the
constitution,
could
not
be
given
to
the
legislative
branch,
and
the
legislative
branch
has
not
seen
fit
to
try
to
take
that
power
in
this
act.
mr.
steven
r.
ross
the
legislative
history
of
the
appointment
provision
clearly
suggests
that
the
congress
intended
and
expected
that
the
president
would
retain
his
right
to
name
whoever
he
so
chose,
and
the
president
in
naming
mr.
bowsher
as
comptroller
general
made
his
own
choice.
mr.
steven
r.
ross
the
legislative
history
indicates--
mr.
steven
r.
ross
--it
provides
that
there
be
suggestions
given
to
the
president
by
the
legislative
branch.
mr.
steven
r.
ross
that's
what
the
statute
provides.
mr.
steven
r.
ross
there
are
differences
between
constitutional
realities
and
political
realities.
mr.
steven
r.
ross
the
fact
that
it
is
a
factfinding
function
is
enough
to
justify
constitutionally
that
it
be
given
to
an
independent
officer.
the
fact
that
it
was
a
factfinding
function
would
not
have
been
enough
politically
to
have
the
congress
give
it
to
someone
who
shares
office
space
with
the
president.
mr.
steven
r.
ross
whether
it
is
discretion
or
not,
it
need
not
be
discretion
for
there
to
be
a
lack
of
trust,
and
the
political
reality
of
this
bill
was
that
when
it
came
to
the
house,
it
was
necessary
for
the
house
to
formulate
an
officer
that
all
within
the
house
could
trust
his
nonpartisanship.
that
officer
was
clearly
the
comptroller
general.
thank
you.
