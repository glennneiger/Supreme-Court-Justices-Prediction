justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
we
did
follow
your
suggestion
and
decide
that
the
removal
provision
of
the
1921
act
were
invalid
under
the
constitution,
how
would
that
leave
the
position
of
the
office
of
comptroller
general
as
to
removability?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
would
be
the
result?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you
concluded
that
the
comptroller
general
were
more
like
myers
than
wiener,
then
you
would
say
that
the
president
could
remove
him
at
will.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
seems
to
me
that
you
really
risk
interfering
with
congress'
intent
far
more
when
you
tamper
with
the
1921
act
than
if
you
adjudicate
the
1985
act.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
not
broader
relief
on
this
particular
judgment.
that's
just
a
more
sweeping
doctrine.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
comptroller
gives
opinions,
though,
on
constitutionality
of
things,
doesn't
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
based
on
my
three
years'
experience
in
the
justice
department,
my
feeling
was,
you
know,
that
if
the
executive
branch
wanted
a
favorable
opinion,
you
went
to
the
attorney
general;
if
congress
wanted
a
favorable
opinion,
you
went
to
the
comptroller
general.
do
you
think
that
is
unreasonable?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
isn't
entirely
a
courtesy,
though,
on
the
part
of
the
comptroller
general,
because
the
reason
the
executive
branch
authorities
seek
the
comptroller
general's
ruling
is
that
they
run
the
risk
of
being
surcharged,
don't
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
don't
you
run
the
risk,
if
the
removal
provision
of
the
1921
act
is
struck
down,
that
you
would
leave
the
office
simply
removable
by
the
president
at
will?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
don't
challenge
the
delegation,
do
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
the
management
audits
that
the
comptroller
general
conducts?
do
you
think
that's
an
improper
use
of
that
function?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they
are
at
least
factual,
mr....
or
essentially
in
the
realm
of
fact,
mr.
morrison,
rather
than
policy
that
agencies
have
been
given
authority
to
enforce.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
$30
billion
or
$60
billion
as
percentage
of
what?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
are
talking
about
10
percent,
5
percent,
something
like
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
in
that
analysis,
do
you
think
it's
a
more
important
element
of
the
comptroller
general's
independence
from
congress'
point
of
view
that
the
president
cannot
remove
him
than
that
congress
can
remove
him?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there's
no
doubt
that
congress
wanted
postmasters
and
that
it
had
no
choice
but
to
allow
the
president
to
appoint
them.
i
don't
see
that
it
is
quite
the
square
precedent
that
you
say.
