justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
solicitor
general,
if
i
back
up
a
minute,
you
paraded
quite
a
few
horrible
things
that
could
happen
if
congress
took
over
the
job.
why
is
it
not
possible
for
the
president
to
do
the
same?
i
mean,
is
congress
the
only
body
in
government
that
does
wrong?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
that
help
me
at
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
learned
that
in
my
first
year
of
high
school.
now
can
we
get
to
something
else?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
is
true
although
congress
has
never
made
an
effort
to
exert
the
authority?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
still
true?
