mr.
alan
b.
morrison
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
i
was
listening
to
the
argument
this
morning,
i
tried
to
put
myself
in
the
place
of
someone
in
the
audience
who
had
not
read
all
the
briefs
and
been
through
the
statutes,
and
to
ask
myself,
why
did
congress
create
this
gramm-rudman
mechanism?
what
were
they
trying
to
do
by
putting
a
new
form
of
governance
into
place
in
which
we
had
one
part
office
of
management
and
budget,
one
part
congressional
budget
office,
and
added
the
comptroller
general
on
top
of
it?
this
surely
was
not,
as
mr.
davidson
suggested,
a
standby
mechanism,
because
we
have
all
the
standby
mechanisms
we
need.
this
is
operative
unless
congress
passes
a
new
law
to
change
it
or
unless
congress
meets
the
budget
targets
of
the
statute.
no,
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
here...
and
this
is
wholly
undisputed...
was
trying
to
create
an
elaborate
mechanism
under
which
it
could
obtain
a
reduction
in
the
budget
deficit
without
having
either
to
increase
taxes
or
to
cut
any
of
the
spending
programs,
because
it
was
unable
to
muster
the
votes
needed
to
do
that
under
our
law-making
provisions
of
the
constitution.
and
so
it
set
up
a
new
mechanism
to
do
this.
it
didn't
do
it,
as
it
has
so
often
done
it
in
delegating
authority
to
administrative
agencies,
because
it
had
too
many
decisions
to
make,
because
the
questions
were
too
technical,
because
we
needed
fairness
and
adjudicative
proceedings.
it
didn't
do
that
for
any
of
these
reasons.
it
did
it
so
it
could
accomplish
through
the
backdoor
that
which
it
could
not
accomplish
through
the
front
door.
and
indeed,
it
is
not
even
going
to
relieve
itself
of
any
responsibilities,
for
under
this
statute,
each
year,
as
it
did
each
year
beginning
in
1789,
including
1985
and
already
in
1986,
it
is
now
passing
on
the
very
same
appropriations
laws
that
it
has
always
passed
on,
and
it
will
have
to
pass
on
through
1991
but
with
only
one
difference,
and
that
is
that
those
laws
really
won't
count
because
if
these
three
unelected
officials
under
the
statute
determine
that
congress
hasn't
done
its
job
properly,
or
they
and
the
president
have
not
been
able
to
reach
agreement
on
a
proper
target
deficit,
then
the
gramm-rudman
override
comes
in
as
a
permanent
rider
affecting
future
laws
by
changing
what
is
actually
going
to
be
appropriated.
that,
i
suggest
to
you,
is
a
kind
of
function
never
before
found
in
the
history
of
our
republic,
where
administrative
officials
are
overriding
whatever
congress
may
do
in
the
future
insofar
as
this
particular
area
of
the
law
is
concerned.
and
it
is
not
a
minor
matter.
it
is
quite
properly,
as
the
solicitor
general
observed,
a
sweeping
power
extending
the
entire
breadth
of
the
federal
government.
in
this
year
alone,
the
budget
reduction
was
$11.7
billion,
and
it
would
have
been
far
higher
but
for
the
cap
put
on
it
in
the
statute.
we
simply
don't
know
how
much
the
budget,
the
deficit
reductions
are
going
to
be
in
the
future.
and
all
of
this
is
not
based
on
what
you
would
hear
today
as
some
kind
of
a
precise
formula.
the
key
ingredients
in
this
deficit
reduction
program
are
estimates.
they
are
estimates
made
as
to
inflation
rate,
unemployment,
the
gross
national
product.
they
are
estimates
made
on
the
basis
of
what
someone
thinks
is
going
to
happen
to
the
economy.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
i
want
to
turn
to
that,
and
i
suppose
this
is
as
good
a
time
as
any,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
think
the
best
evidence
that
these
judgments
being
made
are
political
is
what
happened
when
congress
reviewed
the
possibility
that
these
determinations
would
be
made
by
omb.
the
house
said
we
simply
cannot
accept
that
because
omb
is
political,
as
justice
stevens
remarked
earlier.
these
standards
are
subject
to
such
manipulation,
they
could
come
out
with
anything.
indeed,
senator
gramm
was
asked
on
the
floor
of
the
house...
on
the
floor
of
the
senate,
what
is
the
range
of
budget
deficit
cuts
we
are
talking
about?
he
said
i
couldn't
give
a
worst
case
scenario.
in
1985
alone,
from
august
when
congress
reached
its
predictions
as
to
what
the
budget
deficit
was
going
to
be,
until
october
when
gramm-rudman
reached
the
floor
of
the
senate,
the
prediction
in
that
narrow
timeframe
changed
$30
billion,
and
in
1981
there
was
a
swing
of
$60
billion
in
predicted
deficits
in
a
matter
of
60
days.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
key
ingredient
in
taking
this
away
from--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--well,
as
a
percentage
of
the
entire
federal
budget,
it
is
close
to
a
trillion
dollars,
and
so
far
as
the
portion
which
is
not
exempt,
it
is
about
$500
billion
or
$600
billion.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
the
cuts
this
year
were
4.3
percent
and
4.9
percent
for
non-defense
and
defense,
but
this
is
only
on
a
prorated
basis.
and
that
was...
those
cuts
were
that
small
because
we
had
a
cap
built
into
the
statute.
next
year
there
is
no
cap.
if
the
revenue
projections
in
the
statute,
in
the...
that
were
used
to
form
these
deficit
reduction
targets,
turn
out
to
be
wrong
because
we
have
much
less
income,
then
we
have
no
limit
at
all
on
how
much
the
deficit
reductions
are
going
to
be.
and
what
happened
here
in
this
statute
was
that
the
house
of
representatives
and
the
senate
said
we
cannot
give
these
judgments
to
the
office
of
management
and
budget
because
these
are
subject
to
such
political
manipulation,
and
if
you
look
at
the
statute,
you
will
understand
why.
there
are
lots
of
provisions
in
the
act
dealing
with
how
to
allocate
the
cuts
between
one
branch
and...
between
one
part
of
the
government
and
another,
what
to
do
if
congress
doesn't
pass
appropriation
laws,
what
to
do
about
cost
of
living
increases.
but
there
is
not
a
word
in
the
statute
or
the
legislative
history
about
how
one
is
to
go
about
predicting
what
the
interest
rate
is
going
to
be,
what
the
gross
national
product
is
going
to
be.
no
one
knows
what
these
figures
are
going
to
be
because
they
are
raw,
discretionary
determinations,
entirely
proper
to
be
made
provided
that
they
are
made
by
the
lawmakers
in
this
country,
that
is,
the
president
in
conjunction
with
the
senate
and
the
house
of
representatives
as
envisioned
by
article
1
of
the
constitution.
that
is
how
the
laws
are
being
made.
we
have
here
a
situation
in
which
the
hard
policy
choices
have
not
been
made,
and
i
suggest
to
you
that
the
very
reason
that
gramm-rudman
was
enacted
was
because
the
congress
found
that
it
was
not
making
the
hard
choices.
it
wanted
to
have
defense,
it
wanted
to
have
social
programs,
it
wanted
to
have
clean
air,
it
wanted
to
have
transportation,
and
it
couldn't
pick
and
choose
among
them.
so
it
hoped
that
by
creating
this
mechanism
you
would
have
three
unelected
officials
do
the
job
that
congress
was
supposed
to
do.
and
i
suggest
to
you
that
that
kind
of
abdication
goes
to
the
very
heart
of
our
system
of
government,
and
it
changes
all
of
the
dynamics
around
in
our
legislative
process.
these
are
not
the
kind
of
facts
that
administrators
normally
find.
these
are
sweeping
predictions
as
to
the
future,
trying
to
say
what
is
going
to
happen
to
the
economy.
they
are
the
kinds
of
determinations
which
need
to
be
made
and
which
congress
will
continue
to
make
every
year.
but
that
should
be
done
in
the
legislative
process.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
think
in
fairness,
justice
stevens,
there
are
two
points
to
make.
one
is
that
they
were
made
in
the
middle
of
the
fiscal
year
as
opposed
to
three
or
four
months
before
the
year.
but
much
more
important,
it
didn't
make
any
difference
because
of
the
$11.7
billion
cap.
indeed,
we
heard
this
morning
that
the
budget
deficit
would
actually
have
been
$220
billion.
and
so
while
the
estimates
turned
out
to
be
the
same,
nobody
had
to
spend
much
time
worrying
about
them
because
there
was
no
consequences.
indeed,
the
comptroller
general
himself
said
he
did
that
for
that
reason.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that
is
correct.
i
don't
think
anybody
believes
that
these
figures
are
not
subject
to
wide
fluctuation
and
variation.
indeed,
that
was
the
whole
premise
on
which
the
house
of
representatives
insisted
that
the
house...
that
the
office
of
management
and
budget
be
taken
out
of
them,
simply
because
they
didn't
trust
them,
and
the
reason
they
didn't
trust
them
is
because
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
to
get
your
hands
on.
if
you
look
in
the
statute,
there's
not
a
word
about
how
anybody
is
to
figure
out
any
of
these
very
amorphous
figures.
equally
important,
of
course,
is
the
fact
that
in
this
statute
there
is
a
specific
preclusion
of
judicial
review
for
the
very
determinations
which
are
at
the
heart
of
the
deficit
cutting
mechanism.
all
of
these
economic
assumptions
which
underly
the
how
much
or
in
fact
the
whether
of
deficit
reduction,
all
of
those
are
specifically
made
non-reviewable.
so
the
congress
undoubtedly
would
have
been
concerned
because,
for
whatever
reasons,
because
of
your
views
about
the
policy
initiatives
of
the
administration,
because
you
were
optimistic
or
pessimistic
about
the
economy,
you
thought
that
this
year
would
be
a
good
year
and
there
would
be
a
little
bit
of
a
deficit,
or
because
for
other
reasons
you
wanted
to
cut
certain
programs,
and
the
only
way
you
could
cut
those
programs
was
to
have
a
large
target,
a
large
miss
in
the
target,
so
you
estimated
there
to
be
a
broad
deficit
reduction
needed.
whatever
your
reasons,
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
that
would
prevent
any
of
the
judgments
being
made
here
with
any
number
that
you
could
think
of.
next
year
we
could
have
an
estimate
of
20
percent
inflation
or
2
percent
inflation,
and
nothing
could
be
done
about
it
except
congress
could
pass
a
new
statute,
or
congress
could
fire
the
comptroller
general.
neither
of
those,
we
suggest
to
you,
are
appropriate.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no,
i--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--well,
i
would
certainly
say
that
under
this
court's
decisions
that
prohibit
nonjudicial
functions
being
performed
by
judges,
i
would
say
that
a
member
of
this
court
or
any
other
court
could
not
perform
the
functions
being
performed
by
the
comptroller
general
here.
if
in
my
primary
submission...
my
primary
submission
is
that
these
are
basically
legislative
type
functions
of
the
kind
that
only
congress
can
be
performed
because
there's
no
standards
and
there's
no
checks
or
balances,
but
if
they
are
administrative
type
functions,
then
they
must
be
performed
by
someone
at
the
very
least
who
may
not
be
removed
by
the
legislative
branch,
that
congress
cannot
have
the
power
to
retain
a
hand
on
the
execution
of
a
law
once
it
has
decided
what
the
law
shall
be.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no.
i
believe
that
the--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--that
is
correct,
they
cannot
be
both.
i
believe
principally
that
the
functions
being
performed
here
are
legislative
type
functions.
if
the
court
disagrees
with
me
and
says
that
the
delegation
is
proper,
then
i
say
the
delegation
must
be
performed
by
a
person
who
may
not
be
removed
by
the
congress.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
must
be
performed
by
a
person
who
may
not
be
removed
by
the
congress.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
they
couldn't
be
removed
by
the
congress.
that
objection
would
be
correct,
your
honor.
i
would
also
say,
though,
that
i
believe
that
this
court
has
ruled
that
judges
may
perform
only
judging
type
functions.
they
may
not
perform
executive
functions
under
principles
of
separation
of
powers,
much
as
the
court
ruled
that
the
congress
could
not
perform
executive
functions
in
the
chadha
case.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
precisely,
precisely.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--very
similar
reasons,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes,
your
honor.
let
me
turn
to
the
second
argument
i
made,
which
is
made
only
in
our
brief,
and
that
is
that...
and
this
involves
the
aspect
of
the
statute
under
which
the
office
of
congressional
budget
is
an
intimate
part
of
the
decisionmaking
process
here.
that
is,
when
the
house...
when
the
senate
passed
this
bill,
there
was
a
joint
determination
to
be
made
by
omb
and
cbo
that
would
have
become
the
operative
determination.
everybody
recognized
that
that
would
be
plainly
unconstitutional
under
chadha
and
other,
and
buckley
because
the
control...
the
congressional
budget
office
is
a
pure
arm
of
congress,
no
pretense
of
being
appointed
by
the
president.
in
order
to
attempt
to
cure
that,
what
the
congress
did
was
to
put
an
overlay
on
top
of
the
same
report
that
was
going
to
be
issued
by
omb
and
cbo
of
the
comptroller
general,
and
the
question
before
the
court
in
our
view
on
point
number
two
is
whether
the
addition
of
the
comptroller
general
serves
sufficiently
to
cure
the
constitutional
defect
caused
by
the
congressional
budget
office
being
an
intimate
part
of
the
process.
the
defenders
of
the
statute
say
that
the
cbo
is
purely
an
advisory
official;
it
does
nothing
but
render
advice
to
the
comptroller
general.
that,
in
our
view,
is
an
incorrect
view
of
the
statute,
and
indeed,
of
what
has
happened
under
it
by
the
comptroller
general's
own
affidavit.
and
i
say
that
principally
because
when
one
normally
thinks
of
an
advisor,
the
key
element
of
an
advisor
is
that
you
can
either
take
their
advice
or
reject
it
at
will.
that
is
not
the
case
with
the
statute
here.
the
comptroller
general's
discretion
vis-a-vis
the
two
other
officials,
including
omb
and
cbo,
is
that
first...
and
this
is
in
the
statute
itself...
he
must
give
due
regard
to
their
findings;
second,
he
must
explain
fully
any
deviations
that
he
makes
from
them;
third,
the
legislative
history
and
the
conference
report
says
that
the
comptroller
general
must
use
his
"utmost
discretion"
before
altering
any
of
the
findings
which
they
made.
in
the
memorandum
to
the
house
and
the
senate
before
the
final
debate
on
passage,
the
report
of
cbo
and
omb
was
referred
to
as
a
"draft
order",
and
as
senator
gramm
said
in
supporting
this
piece
of
legislation
and
the
comptroller
general's
role,
the
comptroller
general
would
be
the
"final
arbiter".
now,
that
to
me
does
not
sound
like
a
pure
advisor,
and
in
fact,
congress
did
one
other
thing
which
confirmed
the
major
role
they
thought
that
cbo
would
have,
and
that
is
under
the
fallback
mechanism,
it
doesn't
even
care
what
the
comptroller
general
says
about
these
deficits;
it
relies
solely
on
the
report
of
omb
and
cbo.
now,
of
course,
the
comptroller
general
has
the
final
say.
he
is
ultimately
responsible.
that
is
not
our
bone
of
contention.
what
we
dispute
is
whether
anyone
can
fairly
characterize
this
process
as
purely
advisory,
particularly
since
the
comptroller
general
has
put
in
an
affidavit
which
is
in
the
joint
appendix
saying
that
throughout
this
process
he
consulted
consistently
with
omb
and
cbo
in
order
to
make
the
process
work,
since
indeed
he
has
only
five
days
from
the
time
he
gets
their
report
in
which
he
is
going
to
issue
his
final
order,
and
two
of
those
days
in
each
of
the
first
two
cycles
come
on
weekends.
so
i
respectfully
suggest
to
you
that
what
congress
tried
to
do
here
was
to
keep
its
hand
in
the
process,
to
have
its
budget
person
continue
to
be
part
of
the
process
so
that
it
would
not
get
skewed
away
from
it,
and
it
tried
to
do
that
in
order
to
assure
that
these
open-ended
standards
would
be
met,
and
it
did
it
this
way
and
through
the
comptroller
general
who,
as
ms.
williams
will
now
explain,
remains
an
important
arm
of
congress
in
the
process.
