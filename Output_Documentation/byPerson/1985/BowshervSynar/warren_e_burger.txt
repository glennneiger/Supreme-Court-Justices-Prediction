e.

the
court
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
bowsher
v.
synar
and
others.
mr.
cutler,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
cutler,
if
the
comptroller
general
were
removed
for
any
one
of
the
four
reasons...
i
think
there
are
four
reasons
specified
in
the
statute...
is
there
any
review
by
anyone
of
that
action?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
be
any
different
from
a
removal
by
way
of
an
impeachment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
the
'21
provision
may
be
just
partly
or
slightly
unconstitutional?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
ross?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
you
compare
the
comptroller
general's
function
under
the
1985
act
with
the
president's
function
in
preparing
the
budget?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn't
that
something
like
correcting
the
papers
of
both?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
davidson?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
how
was
he
appointed
in
the
first
place?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
say
that
that
objection
was
founded
on
the
same
objection
to
the
line
item
vetoes?
there's
some
resemblance
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
earlier,
mr.
davidson,
you
had
made...
at
least
i
got
an
intimation
that
judges
could
make
some
kind
of
an
appraisal
of
whether
congress
would
or
would
not
have
passed
the
'21
act
without
the
removal
privilege.
where
do
we
get
our
authority
to
try
to
make
judgments
of
that
kind?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that
was
a
key
factor
in
the
chadha
holding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
solicitor
general?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
the
obm?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting,
mr.
solicitor
general,
that
when
the
comptroller
general
exercises
that
kind
of
a
function
he
is
calling
attention
as
an
overseer,
calling
the
attention
of
congress
so
that
congress
the
next
time
around
on
the
budgets
can
deal
with
the
problem
that
the
comptroller
general
has
pointed
out?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
morrison.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
morrison,
you
may
have
noticed
as
a
member
of
the
bar
that
over
the
last
15
years
on
perhaps
four
or
five
occasions
congress
has
created
special
judicial
panels
and
authorized
the
designation
to
those
panels
of
judges
already
in
office.
is
your
argument
with
respect
to
allocation
of
these
duties
to
the
comptroller
general...
put
it
this
way.
would
your
argument
be
that
what
the
congress
has
undertaken
to
do
here
is
just
as
though
they
had
asked
that
we
assign
these
functions
to
some
presently
sitting
judges--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--who
have
no
executive
authority
and
no
legislative
authority,
and
who
are
not
removable
by
the
president?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--but
your
conclusion
would
be
that
if
they
had
made
that
assignment
to
these
judges
selected
in
that
way,
it
would
be
just
as
improper
as
the
one
you
are
now
challenging.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
for
the
same
reasons.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
similar.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
similar
reasons.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
ms.
williams?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--well,
that's
what
i
was
going
to
get
at.
are
you
saying
that
he's
impinging,
he
is
not
performing
an
executive
function
in
the
sense
that
the
true
executive
does,
but
he
is
impinging
upon
the
executive
role?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
they
might
regard
that
as
inefficiency
or
neglect
of
duty?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
have
been
told
in
briefs
and
in
the
oral
argument
that
the
comptroller
general
has
described
himself
in
effect
as
an
arm,
an
agent
of
the
congress.
has
that
been
true
with
all
the
comptrollers
general
since
1921,
if
you
know?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
in
any
event,
he
must
not
be
removable
by
the
congress
alone,
is
that
your
point?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
there,
ms.
williams,
i
take
it
there
you
are
relying
on
the
fact
that
historically,
for
199
years,
these
functions
have
been
performed
by
the
congress.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
with
the
cooperation
of
the
president.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
cutler?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
