justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
cutler,
the
united
states
argues
that
the
removal
power
by
congress
is
beside
the
point,
that
this
officer
may
not
perform
these
functions
assigned
to
him
unless
the
president
has
unrestricted
power
to
remove.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
did
the
district
court
reject
that
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
that
issue
is
open
here?
would
that
change--
justice
byron
r.
white
--would
it
change
the
reach
of
the
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
purely
executive,
and
so
that
they
may
not
be
performed
by
this
officer
unless
the
president
has--
justice
byron
r.
white
--power
to
remove
at
will.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that...
is
that
a
broader...
if
we
affirmed
on
that
ground,
would
that
be
a
broader
relief?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
would
foreclose,
it
would
foreclose
or
make
beside
the
point
agreeing
with
you
about
the
validity
or
invalidity
of
the
1921
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
you
are
then
somewhat
at
odds
with
your
colleagues
with
respect
to
the
validity
of
the
1921
provision?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
your
bottom...
the
bottom
line
in
your
argument,
that
he
may
perform
these
functions
constitutionally?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
defend
the
provision
in
the
1921
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
defend
assigning
these
particular
functions
to
him
in
the
'85
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
solicitor
general...
or,
not
the
solicitor
general,
but
if
the
delegation
argument
were
accepted
and
we
didn't
agree
with
you,
would
the
judgment
below
be
expanded
or
would
that
give
the
plaintiffs
additional
relief?
justice
byron
r.
white
right,
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
judgment
would
we
really
the
same?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
we
took
the
suggestion
that
mr.
cutler
suggests,
that
if
the
problem
with
the
statute
is
the
removal
power
by
congress,
which
the
district
court
emphasized,
do
you
think
that
congress
would
have
passed
this
statute
if
it
didn't
have
removal
power?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
these
functions
had
been
assigned
to
the
secretary
of
the
treasury,
you
would
say
it
was
a
perfectly
good
delegation--
justice
byron
r.
white
--just
like
you
say
it
is
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
solicitor
general,
would
you
be
satisfied
with
a
judgment
that
in
performing
these
functions
the
comptroller
general
is
a
purely
executive
officer,
subject
to
the
removal
by
the
president
at
will?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you're
arguing
that
performing
these
functions
do
make
him
a
purely
executive
officer.
justice
byron
r.
white
aren't
you?
isn't
that
your
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
you--
--then...
excuse
me.
then
he
would
be
removable
by
the
president
at
will?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
that
we...
you
would
be
satisfied
with
that
judgment,
i
suppose,
but
you
think
that
would
be
an
imperfect
judgment
because
that
isn't
what
congress
would
have
intended?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right,
all
right.
but
let
me
just
ask,
if
i
may
at
this
point,
if
you're
right
that
the
assignment
of
these
functions
makes
him
pro
tanto
an
executive
officer,
it
seems
to
me
then
one
would
conclude
that
the
congress
has
in
effect
amended
the
1921
act
and
said,
this
is
an
executive
removable
by
the
president;
the
president
could
remove
him
and
appoint
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
comptroller
general
and
go
about
his
way.
i
don't
know
why
that
couldn't
follow.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
we
agreed
with
your
argument,
we
would
be
foreclosed
from
saying
the
district
court
erred
in
not
striking
the
removal
provision
of
the
1921
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
didn't
cross-petition
here
or
cross-appeal?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
say,
you
say
these
are
legislative
functions,
so
do
you
disagree
with
the
solicitor
general
that
they
are
purely
executive
functions?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
can't
be
both.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
the
functions
may
be--
justice
byron
r.
white
--i
see.
that's
why
i
suggested
the
question,
the
hypothetical
of
some
of
these
judges
who
couldn't
be
removed
if
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
does
it...
why
does
that
follow?
are
you
arguing
the
delegation
point?
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
could
be...
they
still
could
be
at
least
quasi-legislative
functions
and
be
delegated.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
wouldn't
necessarily
follow
that
they
are
executive
functions.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
just
because
they
are
delegated
doesn't
mean
that
they
cease
being
legislative.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
why
do
you
say
that
they
have
to
be
either.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then,
absent
the
removal
power
by
congress,
you
would
say
this
1985
act
is
all
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
absent,
absent...
if
there
was
no
provision
for
congressional
removal
of
the
solicitor
general...
of
the
comptroller
general,
then
this
act
would
be
all
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
solicitor
general
is,
as
you
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
done
enough
with
its
legislative
task.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
are
arguing
that
there's
an
undue--
justice
byron
r.
white
--yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
it
is
either...
again,
it
is
either...
if
it
isn't
legislative,
it's
executive.
if
it
isn't
executive,
it's
legislative.
