ms.
lois
g.
williams
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
role
of
the
comptroller
general
is
obviously
the
central
question
in
this
case.
we
have
argued
in
agreement
with
mr.
morrison
that
he
is
required
under
this
act
to
make
legislative
decisions,
but
i
would
like
to
spend
most
of
my
time
today
saying
that
if
these
aren't
legislative
decisions
under
the
act
that
he
is
making,
then
at
the
very
least,
they
are
executive
decisions.
they
can't
be
nothing.
they--
ms.
lois
g.
williams
--no,
i
would
like
to
spend
my
time
on
the
separation
of
powers,
comptroller
general
role,
your
honor,
but,
but
i
say--
ms.
lois
g.
williams
--yes,
indeed.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
yes,
indeed.
it
is...
it
seems
to
me
that
no
one
disputes
that
there
are
significant
decisions
made
here--
ms.
lois
g.
williams
--that's
true.
if
it
were
performed
strictly
in
aid
of
the
legislative
function.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
well,
i
don't
understand...
i
beg
your
pardon.
i
don't
understand
the
appellants
to
be
making
the
argument
that
these
are
strictly
in
aid
of
the
legislative
function,
but
rather,
that
they
are
functions
that
may
be
performed
by
an
independent
officer,
and
that
they
rely
on
that
notion.
but
i
would
say
that
they
are...
pardon
me,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
say
that
they
are
executive
in
nature
for
the
same
reason
that
the
solicitor
general
does,
because
what
is
left
to
the
comptroller
general,
if
he
is
not
legislating
when
he
is
doing
this,
is
the
full
implementation
of
this
law.
that's
what's
left
to
him.
that
you
wouldn't
do
with
a
congressional
committee.
that
you
couldn't
do
with
an
arm
of
the
congress.
he
is
taking
over
the
role
of
the
executive
in
the
function.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
he
is
indeed,
your
honor,
but
he
is
doing
it
in
large
measure
by,
as
i
say,
fully
implementing
the
law
himself.
the
president
has
virtually
no
role
but
to
sign
the
order
once
his
work
is
done.
so
every
significant
decision,
every
decision
that
is
made
after
the
legislature
finishes
its
work
is
made
by
this
officer,
and
the
only
thing
that's
at
issue
here
in
this
case
is
whether
congress'
power
to
remove
that
officer
disables
him
from
administering
this
law.
that's
the
only
question.
and
there
is
no
decision
of
this
court
that
suggests
that
congress
may
assume
for
itself
the
right
to
remove
an
officer
who
administers
the
law.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
yes,
if
this
were...
if
we're
talking
strictly
about
the
separation
of
powers
question,
forgetting
the
delegation
argument,
i
would
say
there
is
no
violation
of
the
separation
of
powers
if
this
power
is
deemed
executive
and
it
were
given
to
the
executive
branch,
that's
correct.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
i
would
like
to
see
what
the
office
of
comptroller
general
would
be
like
without
removal,
but
if
he
were
indeed
functioning
like
a
truly
independent
officer,
although
that's
not
at
issue
here,
i
certainly
am
not
prepared
to
argue
that
that
would
be
unconstitutional,
your
honor.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
yes,
and
let
me
just
say
about
that
that
i
think
the
question
of
what
kind
of
an
officer
could
perform
these
duties
is
really
not
at
all
before
this
court,
and
the
reason
is
that
to
decide
that
the
president
must
remove
this
officer
in
some
way
is
by
definition
to
decide
that
he
may
not
be
removed
by
congress,
which
is
now
the
fact,
and
if
that
is
true,
then
the
fallback
mechanism
that
the
statute
provides
should
take
place
because
the
congressional
removal
would
render
the
comptroller
general
unable
to
perform
these
functions.
it
would
simply
be
advised
to
the
congress,
should
it
decide
to
pass
another
law,
what
kind
of
an
officer
it
might
then
choose
to
delegate
this
responsibility
to.
that
is
not,
not
necessarily,
not
at
all
at
issue
here.
the
question
here
is
really
quite
narrow
because
of
the
uniqueness
of
the
comptroller
general's
role
and
his
position,
his
status.
he
is
the,
as
mr.
davidson
points
out,
not
the
only
one
but
virtually
the
only
officer
who
is
so
removable.
i
would
like
to
discuss--
ms.
lois
g.
williams
--yes,
your
honor,
i
do
assume,
but
the
causes
here
are
very
broad:
inefficiency
and
neglect
of
duty.
it's
true
that
those
are
among
the
specified
causes.
they
are
virtually
open-ended,
and
i
am
not
at
all
sure
how
a
solicitor--
ms.
lois
g.
williams
--i
take
it
they
would
never
characterize
it
in
that
fashion,
your
honor.
and
i
think--
ms.
lois
g.
williams
--i
think
the
causes
are
broad
enough
to
include
practically
anything.
but
i
don't...
i
don't
say
that
because
the
removal
power
exists...
and
it
is
narrower,
certainly,
than
removal
at
will.
i
don't
say
that
that
is
something
that
the
comptroller
general
has
any
reason
to
live
in
fear
of,
as
no
good
employee
does,
i
think.
the
power
of
removal
is
the
symbol
of
the
ultimate
power
over
this
office.
it
is
one
of
many
symbols--
ms.
lois
g.
williams
--well,
it
would
depend
a
little
bit
on
how
reviewable
that
decision
would
be,
your
honor.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
that's
right,
and
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
i
think
certainly
the
constitutionality
would
be
reviewable.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
i
have
no
reason
to
think
that
it
would
be
reviewable,
your
honor,
and
given
the
fact
that
it
is
extremely
broad,
that
is
obviously
a
danger.
but
as
i
say,
i
think
that
the
notion
that
removal
is
somewhat
remote,
that
possibility,
doesn't
mean
that
it's
not
relevant,
and
i
think
to
hear
the
appellants'
arguments
suggests
that
it
simply
doesn't
matter
that
that
removal
provision
is
on
the
books,
and
indeed,
they
are
willing
to
abandon
it
altogether,
even
knowing
that
there
is
a
risk,
as
mr.
cutler
has
conceded,
that
that
might
make
removal
by
the
president
possible.
they...
the
assumption
must
be
on
their
part
that
it
has
no
impact
on
this
office,
and
i
think
that
that
assumption
defies
both
history
and
common
sense.
and
this
is
an
officer
whom
the
president
does
appoint.
but
then,
all
influence
ends.
and
as
members
of
the
court
have
indicated
this
morning,
the
comptroller
general
certainly
does
do
his
work
for
the
congress.
the
office
exists
to
serve
the
needs
of
the
congress,
as
this
court
has
said,
to
help
it
legislate.
and
even
in
those
functions
which
have
been
spoken
of
as
aid
to
the
executive,
it
has
been
quite
properly
pointed
out
that
those
are
helpful
probably
at
least
as
much
in
aid
of
the
congressional
interest.
they
are
designed
to
assist
the
congress
in
watching
over
the
president's
stewardship.
that
is
why
the
office
exists,
and
everything
he
does
really
exists
in
that
position
between
the
legislative
and
the
executive
branch,
and
in
that
position,
he
is
the
congress'
partisan;
he
must
be
in
order
to
perform
his
functions
properly.
no
doubt
he
does
function
in
a
largely
nonpolitical,
apolitical
i
should
say,
nonpartisan
way,
in
a
thoroughly
professional
way,
but
he
cannot
remain
neutral
as
to
the
fact
that
congress...
it's
congress'
interests
he
exists
to
serve.
the
comptroller
general
therefore
is
only
as
independent
as
congress
allows
him
to
be,
and
it
might
suit
congress'
interests
that
he
be
quite
so
most
of
the
time.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
i
believe
so,
justice
marshall.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
yes,
and
i
would
say
that
whether...
the
fact
that
no
removal
has
been
attempted
is
at
least
as
strong
an
argument
that
this...
that
this
person
knows
to
whom
he
is
accountable
as
it
is
that
he
not
really
accountable
to
congress.
it
doesn't
really
prove
anything,
that
no
one
has
ever
tried
to
remove
a
comptroller
general,
but
it
may
very
well
demonstrate
that
everyone
understands
the
relationship
that
exists.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
so
far
as
i
know,
your
honor,
and
no
one
has
pointed
to
the
contrary,
although
his
functions
have
been
variously
described,
certainly.
in
1921
it
was
very,
very
clear
that
that
was
the...
i
invite
the
court's
attention
to
that
legislative
history.
that
was
the
intent
of
the
congress,
to
remove
it
from
the
executive
branch,
to
make
him
independent,
yes,
but
to
make
him
answerable
to
congress,
and
it
is
very
clear
that
congress
thought
about
this
matter
carefully
and
considered
all
types
of
removal.
it
passed
the
statute
that
exists...
existed
in
spite
of
a
presidential
veto,
and
they
didn't
override
the
veto,
but
the
new
version
provides
for...
the
one
that
now
exists
provides
for
joint
resolution
removal.
president
wilson
certainly
could
not
have
tolerated
that,
according
to
his
veto
message
on
the
first
bill.
the
one
that
became
law
is,
has,
must
be
the
view
of
the
congress,
and
it
was
very
clear
that
their
primary
goal
was
independence
from
the
president.
it
is
also
very
clear
that
independence
from
the
president
was
achieved
by
retaining
the
removal
power,
and
that
that
was
the
critical
way
in
which
the
congress
could
guarantee
this
independence.
it
made,
it
made
this
officer
answerable
to
itself,
and
of
course,
it
existed
in
order
to
serve
those
interests.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
i
absolutely
do,
your
honor,
and
i
think
they
are
opposite
sides
of
the
same
coin,
that
independence,
total
independence
from
the
president,
in
fact,
on
the
spectrum,
would
be
total
dependence
on
congress,
and
that
the
truest
independence,
as
we
have
argued
in
our
brief,
is
somewhere
between
those
branches,
where
each
branch
has
some
influence.
in
this
situation,
the
congress
has
all
the
influence,
and
the
president,
once
appointment
is
over,
remembering
he
cannot
even
reappoint
this
officer,
his
influence
over
that
officer
ends.
and
therefore,
he
cannot...
removal
is
part
of
the
context
in
which
he
lives,
and
the
fact
that
the
president
has
then
no
control
makes
it
quite
a
credible
statement
that
the
comptroller
general
works
for
the
congress.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor.
i
didn't--
ms.
lois
g.
williams
--indeed
yes,
your
honor.
indeed
yes.
i
would
dispute...
i
mean,
there
may
be
a
large
dispute
about
whether
he
should
be
removed
at
will,
but
that
certainly
is
not
at
issue
in
this
case.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
absolutely,
your
honor,
absolutely.
i
think
that
the
congressional
intent
throughout,
both
the
original
congress,
the
'85
congress,
and,
although
i
haven't
researched
this
thoroughly...
remember,
there
are
a
number
of
intervening
congresses
who
have
given
power
to
this
comptroller
general
as
well,
and
in
order
to
simply
drop
the
removal
provision,
we
would
have
to
assume
that
each
of
those
congresses,
in
giving
power
to
this
officer,
regarded
the
removal
as
incidental
and
that
the
critical
question
for
each
congress
was
the
power
given
no
matter
who
could
remove.
now,
in
the
few
moments
i
have
left,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
delegation
argument,
just
to...
before
i
do
that,
let
me
say
one
other
thing
about
the
1985
act.
in
this
act,
congress
quite
naturally
turned
again
to
the
comptroller
general,
again
thinking
it
needed
independence,
but
most
emphatically
again,
what
they
wanted
in
this
act
was
independence
from
the
president,
as
a
number
of
counsel
this
morning
have
shown.
congress
said,
mr.
president,
you
get
no
voice
in
this
matter.
it
would
not
tolerate
giving
the
functions
to
an
executive
branch
officer,
it
made
that
quite
clear.
so
we
do
know
what
the
intent
of
this
congress
is.
the
intent
was
to
keep
it
out
of
the
hands
of
the
executive.
so
it
made
clear
that
omb
could
not
do
this
job.
it
also
carefully
excised
the
only
discretion
that
the
president
had
in
the
earlier
versions
of
the
bill
so
that
now
he
has
no
discretion
in
the
implementation
of
this
law.
he
makes
virtually
no
choices.
but
this
is
political
distrust,
this
is
political
distrust,
not
the
institutional
concern
that
we
saw
in
the
original
act.
the
comptroller
general
isn't
performing
his
watchdog
function
here.
he's
taking
over
the
executive
branch
function.
he's
doing
the
president's
job.
he's
administering
the
law.
because
congress
didn't
trust
the
president
to
administer
the
law,
it
gave
it
to
the
officer
it
could
trust,
and
we
submit
that
that
decision
was
fatal
to
the
act.
now,
just
a
few
points
about
the
delegation
arguments,
your
honor.
it
is
important
to
see
precisely
which
infirmity
in
this
law
we
complain
of
when
we
talk
about
undue
delegation.
the
delegate
decides
whether
to
cut
spending
at
all.
this
is
the
effect
of
the
decision,
whether
to
cut
spending
at
all
across
the
board,
and
how
much.
this
is
the
heart
of
the
act.
the
act
further
makes
those
decisions
automatic,
and
it's
the
automatic
effect,
without
any
approval
by
elected
officials,
that
make...
that
creates
the
problem
here.
the
forecasting
itself
is
not
alone
a
problem.
and
as
we
have
argued,
there
are
differences
in
kind
and
degree,
but
degree
is
really
the
central
question
here,
whether
congress
has
done
enough
before
handing
this
job
off
to
others.
did
they
succeed--
ms.
lois
g.
williams
--yes.
they
succeed
in
avoiding
the
hard
choices--
ms.
lois
g.
williams
--absolutely,
absolutely,
your
honor.
that's
our...
that
was
our
first
argument
in
our
brief--
ms.
lois
g.
williams
--this
is
an
alternative
ground
for
upholding
the
lower
court.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
yes,
that's
my
argument,
your
honor.
now,
i
would
like
to
just
spend
a
moment
saying
that
the
comptroller
general's
decisions
are
obviously--
ms.
lois
g.
williams
--to
the...
yes,
absolutely,
yes.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
yes,
by
statute.
the
spending
policies
and
the
budget
levels
of
this
nation
have
always
been...
that
has
always
been
accomplished
by
congress,
and
the
question
is
here
did
they
do
enough
of
that
to
allow
them
to
give
the
rest
to
someone
else.
and
the
decisions,
though
they
are
not
couched
as
policy
decisions,
they
are
certainly
not...
i
don't
suggest
that
the
comptroller
general
is
deliberately
choosing
among
programs
that
he
would
like,
but
makes
a
great
many
decisions.
a
policy
vacuum
is
created
by
this
law,
and
the
decisions
made
by
the
comptroller
general
which
are
not
guided
in
the
slightest
by
congress...
these
decisions
are
not
guided
at
all...
jump
into
that
vacuum.
they
fill
that
policy
vacuum.
they
become
the
law.
and
what
policy
does
the
law
establish?
the
law
says
we'll
reduce
the
deficit.
does
it
tell
the
comptroller
general
when
he
has
these
many
choices
to
make
whether
be
should
estimate
the
deficit
in
a
conservative
way,
in
an
extravagant
way?
does
he
decide
on
the
low
side
or
the
high
side
when
he's
predicting
interest
rates?
we
know
that
it
isn't
just
cynical
manipulation
that
can
take
place.
it's
honest
difference
of
opinion.
and
mr.
justice
stevens,
if
they
all
agree,
they
can
all
be
wrong,
and
they
could
be
quite
consistently
wrong.
and
it
might
be
for
the
reasons
that
something
nobody
thought
of
will
happen
in
the
intervening
months.
and
that
happens
all
the
time.
and
the
difficulty
is
that
there
is
no
