mr.
michael
davidson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
before
turning
to
the
delegation
argument,
if
i
may
pick
up
on
several
points
which
have
been
discussed,
in
further
response
to
justice
powell's
question
whether
there
is
any
other
agency
of
the
united
states
for
which
there
is
a
provision
for
congressional
removal,
there
is
one.
there
has
been
since
1933
in
the
tennessee
valley
authority
act
a
provision
that
the
congress
could,
by
concurrent
resolution,
not
even
involving
the
president
of
the
united
states,
remove
members
of
the
tva
board,
and
yet
no
one
has
thought
because
of
that
vestigial
provisions,
as
dormant
as
the
provision
in
the
1921
budget
and
accounting
act,
that
the
tennessee
valley
authority
is
a
committee
of
the
congress.
it
has
functioned
in
a
clearly
executive
capacity,
redeveloped
an
entire
region
of
the
united
states,
notwithstanding
a
provision
which
purports
to
give
to
the
congress
the
power
to
remove
even
without
the
participation
of
the
president.
mr.
michael
davidson
by
the
president
with
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate,
as
is
the
comptroller
general.
and
in
response
to
the
question
what
does
the
comptroller
general
do
for
the
executive
branch,
i
would
add
that
in
each
of
our
libraries
there
are
60
or
more
volumes
of
comptroller
general
decisions,
decisions
which
are
rendered
principally,
overwhelmingly
at
the
request
of
the
executive
branch,
disbursing
and
other
fiscal
offices,
asking
for
the
comptroller
general's
ruling
on
proposed
expenditures.
the
comptroller
general
is
able
to
undertake
that
function
because
in
the
1981
act
the
congress
made
the
critical
decision
that
he
must
be
an
officer
of
the
united
states,
appointed
by
the
president
under
the
appointments
clause.
mr.
michael
davidson
and
the
reason
that
they
run
the
risk
of
being
surcharged
is
that
the
comptroller
general
inherited
under
the
statute
the
power
of
the
control
of
the
treasury,
to
issue
rulings
which
are
binding
on
the
executive
branch.
when
the
congress
considered
in
1921
how
he
should
be
appointed,
it
was
deemed
to
be
indispensable
that
he
be
appointed
by
the
president
because
of
that
very
kind
of
power.
in
1980
when
the
congress
provided
for
the
recommendation
of
names
to
the
president
on
the
appointment
of
the
comptroller
general,
the
statute
was
deliberated
over
several
congresses.
the
point
made
by
the
department
of
justice
that,
in
order
for
the
comptroller
general
to
continue
to
exercise
his
executive
functions,
the
president
must
still
retain
the
power,
and
complete
power,
to
choose
any
comptroller
general
for
nomination
to
the
congress
at
his
discretion.
the
statute
provides
the
word
"recommend"
several
times.
the
legislative
history
is
absolutely
explicit
that
the
president
may
ask
either
for
names...
that's
in
the
statute...
or
to
nominate
anyone
not
on
the
list
whom
the
president
deems
should
be
the
recipient
of
his
nomination.
the
power
of
the
president
to
nominate
the
comptroller
general,
to
appoint
the
person
who
he
deems
to
be
the
best
suited
for
that
position,
subject
to
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate,
has
not
been
infringed
upon
by
the
1980
enactment.
if
i
could
turn
to
the
delegation
issue,
the
plaintiffs,
representative
synar
and
the
treasury
employees
union,
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
below
on
the
alternative
ground
that
the
administrative
powers
under
this
act
may
not
be
delegated
to
any
officer,
no
matter
what
his
or
her
constitutional
qualifications
may
be.
the
district
court
rejected
that
contention,
holding
that
the
congress
has
made
the
policy
judgments
which
constitute
the
essence
of
the
legislative
function.
because
the
act's
administrative
mechanism
is
a
standby
procedure
which
may
never
be
utilized
after
the
present
fiscal
year,
in
large
part
plaintiffs'
contention
is
a
theoretical
argument
against
the
possible
implementation
of
a
statute
relating
to
future
facts.
but
as
anticipated,
the
procedure
is
being
utilized
this
year
to
effect
a
small
reduction
in
this
year's
estimated
$220
billion
deficit.
yet
plaintiffs
point
to
no
determination
of
the
comptroller
for
this
fiscal
year
which
is
even
colorably
questionable
under
the
delegation
argument,
but
look
ahead,
as
i
will
now
with
my
argument,
to
the
fiscal
years
which
will
follow.
mr.
michael
davidson
it
would
effect
the
result
in
this
way.
the
relief
would
be
the
same.
fallback
would
be
required.
mr.
michael
davidson
this
is
an
appropriate
use
of
the
fallback
mechanism.
if
the
congress
can't
delegate
this
authority
to
any
official,
no
matter
what
his
constitutional
qualifications
may
be,
then
the
only
way
to
provide--
mr.
michael
davidson
--the
judgment
would
be
the
same.
again,
the
consequences
of
the
judgment
would
be
vastly
different
because
it
would
affect
the
very
significant
law
of
delegation.
mr.
michael
davidson
and
it
would,
of
course,
render
it
insignificant
if
the
congress
attempted
to
correct
the
statute
by
providing
for
the
delegation
of
this
authority
to
any
other
officer.
congress
would
be
told
that
it
cannot
provide
for
an
administrative
mechanism,
even
on
a
standby
basis.
looking
ahead,
then,
with
the
plaintiffs
to
future
fiscal
years,
it
is
important
to
note
both
what
the
comptroller
general
does
and
when
he
does
it.
the
annual
budget
process
begins
in
january
or
february,
when
the
president
submits
his
message
to
the
congress,
and
continues
until
october
1st,
when
it
is
hoped
that
the
congress
has
completed
action
on
the
budget
for
the
following
year.
the
comptroller
general's
formal
administrative
responsibilities
under
the
act
occur
in
the
latter
part
of
this
process,
on
the
eve
of
its
home
stretch
in
september,
when
the
comptroller
reports
to
the
president
on
august
25th
about
the
extent
to
which
the
budget
which
has
been
enacted
to
date
or,
utilizing
various
assumptions
in
the
statute
which
would
then
apply
if
it
has
not
been
enacted,
calculates
the
amount
by
which
the
deficit
would
exceed
the
amount
prescribed
in
the
statute.
the
terms
of
the
act
establish
that
the
congress
has
fulfilled
the
essence
of
the
legislative
function
by
establishing
policy
and
prescribing
the
means
of
attaining
it.
first
the
law,
and
not
the
comptroller
general,
determines
what
the
maximum
permissible
deficit
is.
the
comptroller
general
is
simply
given
no
authority
to
make
economic
judgments
or
his
own
behalf
as
to
what
the
desirable
level
of
deficit
financing
should
be.
and
the
law,
not
the
comptroller
general,
established
the
legal
rules
for
the
assumptions
about
what
should
go
into
or
be
excluded
from
the
base
of
revenues
and
expenditures.
the
law,
not
the
comptroller
general,
establishes
that
any
required
reductions
should
be
spread
across
the
budget.
it
mandates
equal
sacrifices
on
the
defense
and
non-defense
sides
of
the
budget.
it
mandates
designated
exceptions
and
limitations.
and
then
it
mandates
uniform
reduction
of
all
other
accounts.
after
examining
the
act
in
great
detail,
the
district
court
concluded
that
it
was
not
true,
as
the
plaintiffs
allege,
that
the
congress
has
declined
to
make
the
hard
political
judgments.
it
is
true
that
the
act
delegates
to
the
comptroller
an
important
fact
finding
function.
but
those
facts,
the
district
court
correctly
concluded,
are
no
more
difficult
to
ascertain
than
the
facts
which
are
calculated
in
determining
the
discount
rate,
functions
which
other
agencies
wielding
far
more
economic
power
have
undertaken
without
question
for
years.
in
this
court,
in
addition
to
renewing
their
specific
arguments
which
the
district
court
had
rejected,
the
plaintiffs
make
the
further
argument
that
the
act
should
fail
because
it
was
motivated
in
their
view
by
the
desire
of
congress
to
avoid
political
responsibility.
this
new
contention
founders
on
the
principle
that
the
court
will
not
inquire
into
the
praiseworthiness
of
the
motives
of
the
congress.
but
moreover,
objectively,
as
the
act
is
structured
and
as
it
in
intended,
it
is
designed
to
promote,
and
not
to
avoid,
political
responsibility.
if
in
any
of
the
next
five
years
the
comptroller
reports
to
the
president
and
the
congress,
on
the
basis
of
the
law
and
facts
in
august
of
that
year,
that
there
will
be
an
excess
deficit,
then
the
president
is
to
issue
a
deficit
reduction
order.
but
the
effectiveness
of
that
order
is
delayed
from
september
1st
to
october
1st,
for
perhaps
the
30
most
critical
days
of
the
entire
budget
calendar.
what
that
report
does
is
it
informs
the
congress
of
the
degree
to
which
expenditures
must
be
reduced
or
revenues
increased
to
provide
for
deficit
reduction
in
another
manner.
and
literally
every
appropriation,
every
revenue
decision
of
the
congress
in
that
month,
is
done
with
the
full
knowledge
of
the
legal
consequences
of
not
producing
deficit
reduction
in
another
way.
and
then
the
act
provides
that
the
president
shall
issue
a
further
order
in
the
month
of
october,
following
a
subsequent
report
of
the
comptroller.
that
report
of
the
comptroller
will
identify
for
the
president,
for
the
congress,
and
for
the
public
the
degree
to
which
the
congress
has
either
attained
the
objectives
of
the
act
in
another
way
or
has
not
attained
those
objectives.
furthermore,
political
accountability
is
ensured
by
the
very
nature
of
the
spreading
of
the
deficit
reduction
across
the
budget.
this
is
not
an
act
that
singles
out
individual
groups
for
special
treatment.
it's
an
act
that
requires
that
reduction
be
across
the
budget
and
affecting
a
wide
variety
of
groups.
the
parties
to
this
lawsuit,
whether
they
be
members
of
congress,
the
executive
branch,
the
amici
representing
very
articulate
and
powerful
interests,
are
all
participants
in
that
process.
so
what
we
have
here
is
an
opportunity
through
the
political
process
to
decide
whether
the
congress
should
in
some
other
way
achieve
objectives
which
the
congress
and
the
president
have
legislated
into
law.
if
i
could
pick
up
a
theme
on
the
fallback,
this
administrative
mechanism
is
a
standby
mechanism
and,
as
i
indicated,
it
may
never
be
utilized
again
after
this
first
year.
but
it
is
a
fundamental
part
of
the
statute,
because
it
was
perceived
by
the
sponsors
of
the
act
and
endorsed
by
the
congress
that
a
mechanism,
reliable
and
predictable
in
nature,
was
necessary
to
discipline
the
budget
process.
if
this
court
is
to
strike
the
administrative
mechanism,
then
it
removes
from
the
statute
what
was
perceived
to
be
the
statute's
unique
contribution
to
deficit
reduction.
now,
there
may
be
some
circumstances
in
which
the
fallback
is
the
perfectly
appropriate
alternative.
if,
for
example,
as
i
indicated,
this
court
would
decide
that
this
power
may
not
be
delegated
to
an
administrative
officer,
then
annual
deficit
reductions
through
legislation
is
the
only
alternative.
and
if
this
court
were
to
conclude,
agreeing
with
the
solicitor
general,
that
this
function
could
only
be
performed
by
an
officer
who
serves
at
the
president's
pleasure,
then
it
is
difficult
to
say
that
the
congress
would
have
passed
this
statute.
and
the
reason
why
it
is
difficult
to
say
that
is
that
it
is
indispensable
to
the
statute
that
there
be
a
neutral
mechanism,
not
committed
to
the
policy
objectives
of
the
congress
or
the
president,
to
play
the
role
of
scorekeeper.
mr.
michael
davidson
it
is
a
very
similar
type
of
concern.
policy
decisions
are
made
by
the
congress
in
enacting
appropriations.
this
act
requires
that,
if
there
is
to
be
deficit
reduction
under
the
act,
no
program
or
project
will
be
singled
out
with
any
different
treatment
except
as
provided
in
the
statute
through
an
exemption.
mr.
michael
davidson
i
think
the
evidence
is
that
it
probably
would
have.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
in
enacting
this
statute
the
congress
was
only
searching
for
an
officer
who
would
be
neutral
and
impartial
in
those
judgments.
there
is
not
one
shred
of
evidence
in
the
legislative
history
that
the
congress
was
seeking
an
officer
over
whom
it
had
any
control.
if
the
removal
provision
was
stricken
and
if
either
the
result
was
that
the
comptroller
general
was
removable
only
by
impeachment,
as
the
only
other
alternative
under
the
1921
act,
or
that
there
is
an
implied
reservation
of
presidential
authority,
constitutional
presidential
authority
to
remove
for
cause,
the
comptroller
general
would
remain
an
independent
officer.
the
reasons
for
removal
do
not
include
disagreement
with
his
policies,
but
only
malfeasance
in
office
or
gross
inefficiency
in
office,
the
failure
of
the
office
to
operate,
but
not
the
determinations
of
the
office.
mr.
michael
davidson
we
agree
with
the
comptroller
general
that
under
this
court's
decision
in
weiner
the
court
would
look
to
the
functions
of
the
comptroller
general
in
determining
whether
it
is
the
kind
of
function
which
requires
presidential
removal
at
will.
and
we
think
that
it
would
find
in
those
circumstances,
starting
from
the
1921
act,
that
it
was
the
intention
of
the
congress
that
the
comptroller
general
not
be
subject
to
the
policy
pleasure
of
any
official
of
the
united
states,
whether
it
be
the
congress
or
the
president.
the
congress
thought
in
1921
that,
looking
at
the
cases
that
it
then
knew,
prior
to
myers,
that
it
could
be
the
agent
to
determine
whether
the
comptroller
general
had
reached
such
a
degree
of
inefficiency
or
malfeasance
that
removal
was
required.
but
it
specifically
eschewed
the
power
to
remove
for
no
cause
at
all.
if
the
court
retains
that
basic
idea,
which
we
think
is
required
by
the
legislative
history
of
that
office,
the
comptroller
general
would
remain
under
the
'85
act
an
independent
officer
performing
exactly
the
function
which
the
congress
has
asked
him
to
perform
under
that
act.
in
those
circumstances,
it
would
be
unnecessary
to
radically
change
the
statute
from
one
which
contains
an
administrative
mechanism
to
one
which
requires
an
annual
deficit
reduction
legislation,
because
the
objectives
of
the
congress
would
still
be
preserved.
let
me
add
one
further
thought
on
the
question
of
the
1921
act.
we
have
made
the
further
argument,
as
the
third
circuit
decided
only
last
month,
that
the
removal
issue
is
not
ripe
for
adjudication.
the
third
circuit
emphasized
the
fact
that
it
had
never
been
used,
and
i
would
like
to
add
just
one
further
point
to
that.
the
1921
act
provides
for
a
future
enactment
of
the
congress.
that's
an
enactment
which
would
have
to
be
approved
bicamerally
and
presented
to
the
president.
this
court
has
never
anticipated
a
future
enactment
of
the
congress.
and
prior
to
the
congress
ever
adopting
a
joint
resolution
of
removal,
it
would
be
faced
with
the
serious
constitutional
questions
that
this
court's
decisions
from
myers
on
have
presented.
we
think
that
the
level
of
respect
from
one
coordinate
branch
to
another...
that
the
congress
be
given
that
first
opportunity,
if
ever
the
removal
issue
were
presented
to
it.
mr.
michael
davidson
i
think
it
is
the
judgment
that
this
court
made
in
chadha,
the
legislative
veto
case,
when
the
contention
was
placed
before
the
court
that
the
congress
would
not
have
delegated
the
authority
to
the
attorney
general
to
suspend
and
then
cancel
deportation
without
reserving
the
opportunity
to
review
that
decision.
mr.
michael
davidson
not
in
its
constitutional
holding,
but
in
the
court's
prior,
preliminary
ruling
that
that
statute
was
severable.
the
same
severability
analysis
applied
to
the
comptroller
general
would
indicate
that
congress
has
intended
to
assign
to
him
the
administrative
functions
which
he
has
had
since
1921,
and
that
if
there
is
a
defect
in
a
potential
method
of
congressional
control
over
that
assignment
of
powers
to
an
officer
of
the
united
states,
the
defect
is
cured
by
striking
it
and
retaining
the
authority
of
the
officer.
thank
you.
