mr.
charles
fried
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
section
251
of
the
1985
act
gives
the
comptroller
general
critical
responsibility
for
the
execution
of
the
act
by
assigning
to
him
the
determination
of
reductions
in
outlays
throughout
the
government.
this
grant
of
authority
violates
the
constitution,
first
and
principally
because
the
grant
is
to
an
official
removable
only
on
the
initiative
of
the
congress,
an
official
who
is
for
this
and
because
of
congress'
intent
expressed
in
many
other
ways
an
agent
of
congress.
and
second,
because
executive
functions
importantly
affecting
the
whole
of
the
executive
branch
and
directing
the
president
himself
may
only
be
performed
by
an
officer
who
serves
at
the
pleasure
of
the
president.
i
would
like
to
say
at
the
outset
that
this
second
argument
does
not
in
our
view
in
any
way
cast
any
doubt
on
the
validity
of
agencies
such
as
the
federal
reserve
board,
the
federal
trade
commission,
or
any
such
agencies,
and
that
the
notion
that
the
second
argument
in
some
sense
endangers
those
agencies
or
would
embark
this
court
on
some
constitutional
adventure
is
simply
a
scare
which
we
don't
intend
to
throw
into
the
court
and
i
don't
think
need
be
thrown
there.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
the
principal
point,
justice
o'connor,
is
that
the
powers
which
are
given
to
the
comptroller
general
here
are
so
sweeping
they
affect
every
nook
and
cranny
of
the
executive
department.
they
give
orders
to
the
president
himself.
they
affect
every
one
of
the
executive
agencies.
and
there
is
no
single
agency
of
those
that
we
are
perfectly
familiar
with
which
has
any
such
sweeping
powers.
and
the
argument
we
make
is
simply
that
an
officer
who
can
have
that
pervasive
effect
on
the
executive
branch
must
be
removable
by
the
president
at
will.
mr.
charles
fried
the
federal
reserve
board
is
a
good
example,
because
in
fact
what
the
federal
reserve
board
does
is
to
determine,
as
the
bank
which
it
is
established
to
be,
the
interest
rate
it
will
charge
to
its
clients.
now,
that
determination
has
implications.
it
has
implications
which
do
indeed
have
an
effect.
it's
quite
interesting
that
the
statute
setting
up
the
federal
reserve
board
specifically
said
that
nothing
in
it
shall
in
any
sense
impinge
on
the
powers
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury.
here
we
have
an
official
who
gives
orders
to
the
president.
i
don't
think
we
have
that
in
respect
to
the
federal
reserve
board
or
any
other
of
the
agencies
which
we're
familiar
with.
so
i
think
it's
really
quite
a
different
thing.
the
reason
that
the
argument
that
i'm
making
sounds
novel
is
that
these
powers
are
entirely
novel.
mr.
charles
fried
not
at
all.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
the
president
of
course,
as
this
court
has
said
on
numerous
occasions,
exists
to
execute
the
laws.
mr.
charles
fried
and
this
would
be
a
law,
and
it
would
be
a
law
which
he
would
to
execute.
there's
no
question
of
that.
mr.
charles
fried
no,
justice
rehnquist.
it
would
seem
to
us
that
between
one
far
pole,
where
the
actions
of
an
officer
are
merely
ministerial...
in
our
view,
the
comptroller
general's
actions
here
are
very
far
from
being
merely
ministerial...
and
the
other
far
pole,
where
the
officer
acts
entirely
at
large,
there
is
a
very
large
terrain.
it
is
the
usual
terrain
of
executive
action
and
administration,
and
it
is
in
that
terrain
that
the
comptroller
general
is
asked
to
act.
mr.
charles
fried
that
would
have
been--
mr.
charles
fried
--perfectly
proper,
if
it
had
been
assigned
to
the
secretary
of
the
treasury.
mr.
charles
fried
or
the
director
of
the
obm,
yes,
chief
justice
burger.
in
our
view,
the
principal
purpose
of
the
office
of
the
comptroller
general
established
in
the
1921
budget
and
accounting
act
was
to
serve
as
the
auditor
for
congress.
to
the
extent
that
the
comptroller
general
has
interpreted
the
1921
act
as
going
beyond
that
conception,
the
executive
has
always
resisted
such
accretions
to
the
central
function.
in
1933,
the
solicitor
general
said
to
the
court
in
miguel
against
mccall...
and
i'll
quote
it
in
extenso
because
it's
exactly
our
position
today.
"it
was
the
purpose
of
congress
that
the
comptroller
general
should.
"
--now
quoting
from
the
act...
--exercise
in
general
a
control
over
all
of
the
accounting
procedures
of
the
government.
but,
said
the
solicitor
general--
"the
accounting
procedures
relate
to
accounting,
and
power
over
accounting
is
not
power
to
decide
how
the
laws
shall
be
administered.
"
that
is
precisely
our
contention
today,
that
power
over
accounting
is
not
power
to
decide
how
the
laws
shall
be
administered.
and
that
has
been
the
consistent
position
of
the
executive
branch.
mr.
charles
fried
those
are
very
useful,
but
the
position
of
the
executive
branch
has
consistently
been
that
those
are
not
final
and
determinatively
binding
on
the
executive.
that
indeed
was
the
issue
is
miguel
against
mccall,
and
this
court
supported
the
executive,
ordered
that
a
particular
pension
be
paid
to
a
philippine
scout
which
the
comptroller
general
general
had
finally
determined
should
not
be
so
paid.
so
the
position
really
of
the
executive
has
been
that
way
consistently.
in
1969,
when
the
administration
instituted
the
so-called
philadelphia
plan,
the
comptroller
general
purported
to
say
that
this
was
an
unauthorized
use
of
appropriations.
the
executive
resisted
that
determination.
in
stotts
v.
lynn,
then
the
comptroller
general,
under
the
impoundment...
in
the
impoundment
control
act,
sought
to
bring
suit
against
the
executive,
the
executive
resisted
that
exercise
of
power
by
the
comptroller
general.
mr.
charles
fried
that
is
our
view
of
his
principal
function,
as
the
auditor
for
the
congress,
on
behalf
of
the
congress,
as
one
of
the
congressmen
in
the
debates
on
the
1921
act
said,
a
watchdog
and
a
critic
on
behalf
of
congress.
and
that
is
the
central
function
which
the
comptroller
general
so
admirably
has
performed
throughout
the
life
of
that
office.
mr.
charles
fried
we
make
no
point
of
whether
he
is
an
officer
of
the
united
states.
because
he
has
been
appointed
by
the
president,
he
is
an
officer
of
the
united
states.
we're
not
at
all
sure
that
these
very
same
functions
could
not
as
conveniently
and
as
easily
have
been
performed
by
someone
appointed
by
the
congress
itself.
but
having
been
appointed
by
the
president,
we
make
no
point
of
the
fact
that
he
is
or
is
not
an
officer
of
the
united
states.
the
constitutional
temptation
here,
as
in
miguel
against
mccall,
as
in
stotz
v.
lynn,
and
throughout
this
history,
has
been
on
the
part
of
congress
to
try
to
have
it
both
ways.
our
constitutional
scheme
is
one
in
which
congress
makes
general
laws
and
the
executive
administers
those
laws.
congress
cuts
the
pie,
the
executive
chooses.
in
this
case,
congress
has
sought
both
to
cut
the
pie
and
to
choose.
congress
chooses
to
legislate
in
a
general
way
because
circumstances
make
detailed
regulation
inconvenient.
yet
here
it
has
been
unwilling
to
let
go
of
the
actual
administration
of
its
general
will,
and
so
it
has
cast
about
for
an
agent
who
is
at
once
respected
for
its
competence
and
integrity,
but
nonetheless
has
a
close
and
special
relationship
to
itself.
and
that
is,
and
from
the
outset
has
been,
the
conception
of
the
comptroller
general.
if
this
assignment
of
executive
power
by
congress
to
its
agent
the
comptroller
general
is
good,
what
may
congress
not
assign
to
him?
the
idea
has
great
potential.
indeed,
in
a
provision
of
the
very
section
before
us
which
has
not
been
brought
into
action,
251(d)(3)(c)(2),
it
is
stated
that
the
president
may
cancel
certain
defense
contracts,
but
only
if
the
comptroller
general
determines
that
saving
money
in
this
way
is
reasonable.
we
wonder,
could
congress
circumvent
the
chadha
decision
by
conditioning
the
promulgation
or
repromulgation
of
agency
regulations
on
some
such
determination
by
the
comptroller
general
of
reasonableness
or
consonance
with
the
public
interest?
in
short,
what
we
have
here
is
a
temptation,
a
potentiality
for
what
the
federalist
papers
called
aggrandizement
by
the
legislative
branch.
and
like
chadha,
we
view
this
potential
as
particularly
menacing.
our
first
and
principal
contention
is
that
the
comptroller
general
is
an
agent
of
congress
and
so
may
not
perform
the
significant
and
pervasive
executive
functions
assigned
to
him
by
this
act.
it
seems
quite
clear
that
the
functions
assigned
to
the
comptroller
general
are
indeed
full
of
judgment,
full
of
discretion.
he
must
make
predictions
based
on
very
controversial
criteria:
what
will
interest
rates
be?
what
will
be
the
level
of
unemployment?
mr.
charles
fried
i
don't
see
how
this
court,
justice
white,
could
arrive
at
that
conclusion.
mr.
charles
fried
justice--
mr.
charles
fried
--it
is,
justice
white.
we
argue
that...
no,
actually
there's
a
trap
there,
i
think.
[laughter]
it's
a
trap.
it's
a
trap
into
which
we
believe
the
amerine
court
fell,
because
that
is
to
argue
in
a
rather
tight
circle,
and
i'd
rather
not
do
that,
because
that
is
to
ask,
is
the
comptroller
general
doing
something
executive?
yes,
he
is.
then
therefore
he's
a
member
of
the
executive
branch,
and
then
therefore
it's
all
right
for
him
to
do
something
executive.
mr.
charles
fried
that
would
go
mr.
cutler's
route
as
to
severability,
and
we
have
great
doubts
about
that
because
severability
is
a
matter
of
divining
the
intent
of
congress
in
the
event
that
something
congress
has
done--
mr.
charles
fried
--we
would
not
be
satisfied
with
that
judgment,
with
respect,
because
we
think
it
would
he
an
incorrect
judgment.
mr.
charles
fried
the
1985
act
was
passed
under
the
shadow,
under
the
clear
shadow,
of
the
doubts
which
the
executive
had
always
raised
about
giving
executive
functions
to
the
comptroller
general.
indeed,
as
the
act
was
being
debated
the
executive
branch
had
filed
objections
exactly
the
same
tenor
as
my
argument
today
in
the
amerine
case.
and
in
the
face
of
that
fact,
the
congress
said:
if
the
cbo-omb-general
accounting
officer
trigger
fails,
then
what
we
want
is
the
fallback
provision.
and
if
that
is
what
congress
determined,
then
surely
that
is
what
this
court
should
do.
it's
the
question
whether...
well,
it's
quite
striking,
because
we
have
here
a
central
conception
of
who
this
officer
is.
he
is,
as
we
say,
the
auditor
for
congress.
now,
congress
has
come
in
and
given
him
another
inconsistent
role.
surely
the
appropriate
thing
to
do
is
to
remove
that
later,
inappropriate
role,
rather
than
to
reconstitute
a
whole
office
which
was
very
deliberately
constituted
in
that
way
in
1921.
mr.
charles
fried
oh,
no.
the
president
in
the
many
years
of
his
history
i'm
sure
has
committed
as
many
wrongs
as
the
congress.
but
he
commits
his
wrongs
in
the
execution
of
the
law
and
congress
commits
its
wrongs
in
making
general
laws.
it
world
be
a
pity
if
they
started
committing
each
other's
wrongs.
[laughter]
mr.
charles
fried
i
think
so,
i
think
so.
i
think
it's
very
important
that
the
division
of
powers
in
the
constitution
be
kept
rather
distinct.
the
constitution,
after
all,
says
that
the
legislative
power,
section
1
of
article
i,
this
legislative
power
is
in
the
congress.
mr.
charles
fried
and
it
is...
well,
i
think
that
is
what
we
rely
on,
that
the
legislative
power
is
in
the
congress,
while
the
executive
power
is
in
the
president.
and
for
that
reason,
it
is
a
dangerous
confusion
to
start
giving
executive
powers
to
congress
or,
i
suppose,
legislative
powers
to
the
president.
mr.
charles
fried
justice
o'connor,
it
was
the
position
of
the
executive
in
stotz
v.
lynn
that
the
power
under
the
impoundment
act
to
bring
suit
was
not
valid,
and
for
very
similar
reasons
to
those
that
i'm
making
here.
it
was
our
position
in
1969,
when
the
comptroller
general
purported
to
make
a
definitive,
binding
ruling
that
the
philadelphia
plan
was
unauthorized,
that
the
executive
department
must
look
to
the
attorney
general
for
binding
opinions
as
to
law.
and
indeed,
that
was
the
issue
in
1933
in
miguel
v.
mccall.
so
there
are
these
expressions
on
the
central
role
of
the
comptroller
general,
and
wherever
they
have
appeared
the
executive
department
has
been
vigilant
to
make
an
issue
of
them,
that
is
correct.
but
that
is
an
issue,
that
is
a
vigilance,
we
have
exercised
for
over
half
a
century,
and
in
precisely
the
terms
we
urge
on
you
today.
that
the
comptroller
general
is
an
agent
of
congress
is
we
think
shown
most
dramatically
by
the
mode
of
his
removal.
the
congress
was
very
aware
of
what
it
was
doing
when
in
created
this
mode
of
removal.
it
chose
to
do
that
knowing
how
to
make
an
agent
removable
for
cause
by
the
president,
and
yet
did
not
do
so.
subsequently
to
that
legislation,
the
congress
on
a
number
of
occasions
has
described
the
comptroller
general
as
being
within
the
legislative
branch.
and
indeed,
the
comptroller
general
by
his
own
profession
is
a
member
of
the
legislative
branch.
at
the
beginning
of
the
red
book,
the
comptroller
general's
bible,
the
principles
of
federal
appropriations
law,
he
states
that
the
gao
is
a
nonpartisan,
independent
agency
in
the
legislative
branch.
and
this
court
itself
has
adopted
that
designation
in
the
very
recent
case
of
bossier
and
marc,
adding
the
phrase
that
"the
comptroller
general
exists
in
large
part
to
serve
the
needs
of
congress.
"
now,
this
seems
to
us
to
indicate
the
kind
of
subservience
which
is
inappropriate
in
one
executing
the
law.
this
subservience,
of
which
the
district
court
spoke,
is
of
course
not
a
personal
reflection
on
the
comptroller
general.
his
office
has
been
characterized
by
integrity
and
competence.
i
hope
the
same
thing
would
be
said
of
the
office
of
the
solicitor
general.
yet
there
is
no
question
but
that
that
officer
is
subservient
in
the
constitutional
sense
to
the
president,
as
the
provisions
for
his
removal
in
the
statutes
clearly
show.
the
point
we
make
about
subservience
is
a
structural,
not
a
personal,
point.
now,
i'd
like
to
return
for
a
moment
to
our
second
argument,
which
is
that
these
powers,
whatever
other
powers
may
be
given
to
an
officer
who
is
not
removable
at
will
by
the
president,
these
powers
are
so
far-reaching
that
they
constitute
indeed
a
constitutional
novelty,
and
a
novelty
of
quite
remarkable
proportions,
and
that
the
holding
in
humphrey's
executor,
the
practice
of
the
legislature,
the
whole
existence
of
administrative
agencies,
in
no
way
provides
a
precedence
for
this
kind
of
sweeping
power,
a
power
which
extends
to
giving
orders
to
the
president
himself.
now,
as
to
the
severability,
i
think
that
a
number
of
the
questions--
mr.
charles
fried
--i
believe
so,
justice
white,
yes.
mr.
charles
fried
we
did
not,
we
did
not.
if
one
turns
to
that
removal,
the
severability
problem,
it
is
a
question,
what
exactly
is
this
court
to
do
if
they
agree
with
mr.
cutler's
suggestion?
is
it
to
be
a
simple
excision
of
the
offending
removal
provision,
leaving
the
comptroller
general
irremovable?
or
does
mr.
cutler
propose
reconstructive
surgery,
with
some
new
removal,
some
new
and
apt
removal
provision
being
substituted?
the
very
question
indicates
how
inappropriate
it
would
be
to
reach
back
and
refashion
an
office
carefully
fashioned
in
1921
in
order
to
solve
a
problem
created
in
1985,
particularly
when
in
1985
the
congress
quite
explicitly
stated
what
it
wanted
done
in
the
event
there
was
a
problem.
thank
you.
