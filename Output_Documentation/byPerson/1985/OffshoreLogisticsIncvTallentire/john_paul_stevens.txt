let
me
ask
about
the...
what
is
the
support
for
the
statement
that
the
remedy
was
to
be
exclusive?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
the
part
you
quote
at
page
22
of
your
brief?
you
have
a
long
quote
there
that
i
thought
that
was
from
a
letter
rather
than
the
report
itself.
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
is
not
really
a
statement
written
by
the
committee
itself;
it
is
something
they
put
in
the
report
that
had
been
written
by
somebody
who
submitted
information
to
the
committee,
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
this
is
a
quote
from
one
of
those
letters?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
anything
that
the
committee
itself
wrote
that
supports
the
proposition
that
the
remedy
was
to
be
exclusive
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
plus
whatever
the
colloquy
is
on
that
that
has
been
quoted
in
some
of
the
papers,
and
that
doesn't
really
go
to
the
exclusivity
point,
as
i
recall
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
going
back
to
your
original
argument,
if
i
may,
for
a
moment,
what...
you
said
that
if
section
7
were
neutral
and
so
forth.
is
it
your
position
that
if
dohsa
had
never
been
passed
at
all...
let
me
ask
it
this
way.
if
dohsa
hat
never
been
passed
at
all,
what
is
your
position
as
to
the
result
in
this
case
and
hamilton?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
would
not
say
that
there
could
not
have
been
recognition
of
a
state
remedy
if
there
had
never
been
a
dohsa?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
in
the
absence
of
dohsa,
what
would
that
uniform
admiralty
rule
have
been?
we
don't
know,
do
we?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
hanemann,
in
fact,
in
the
next
sentence
in
justice
holmes'
opinion,
he
says
insofar
as
the
objection
is
based
on
the
admiralty
clause,
it
would
not
seem
to
matter
whether
the
accident
happened
near
the
shore
or
in
mid
ocean.
so
he
agrees
with
justice
o'connor's
proposition
that
the
place
isn't
all
that
controlling.
