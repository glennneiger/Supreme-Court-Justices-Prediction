well,
are
you
saying
that
would
be
true
even
if
congress
intended
that
state
remedies
apply?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
though
certainly
it
doesn't
look
very
neutral
on
its
face,
and
i
think
that's
the
problem
you
have
along
with
the
legislative
history.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
that
be
true
even
if
he
intended
to
alter
the
text
in
the
way
that
his
statements
indicated?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
moragne
apparently
would
permit
the
kind
of
recovery
that
is
being
sought
here
in
territorial
waters,
as
i
understand
it.
it
would
allow
nonpecuniary
loss
recovery.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
whatever
result
we
reach
results
in
some
anomalies.
i
mean,
there
is
just
no
way
to
reconcile
everything
whichever
way
we
go,
is
there?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
hanemann,
how
do
you
account
for
the
fact
that
other
courts
have
agreed
with
the
petitioner
and
that
scholarly
writers
on
the
subject
have
generally
agreed
with
the
petitioner
all
these
years?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
that
state
law
applied
to
accidents
on
territorial
waters
has
a
more
local
flavor
to
it
than
the
extension
of
the
application
of
state
law
to
accidents
on
the
high
seas,
maybe
hundreds
or
thousands
of
miles
from
shore.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
if
the
accident
with
the
same
parties
had
occurred
in
the
gulf
of
aqaba,
i
assume
you
would
be
making
the
same
argument,
wouldn't
you?
