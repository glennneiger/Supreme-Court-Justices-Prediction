justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
jones,
how
far
in
towards
the
shore
does
the
dohsa
come?
is
it
a
what,
a
marine
league?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
far
is
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
should
we
take
representative
goodykoontz's
word
as
opposed
to
congressman
mann's
word
who
apparently
drafted
the
thing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
like
the
saving
to
suitors
clause?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
has
it
been
authoritatively
decided
whether
or
not
a
dohsa
cause
of
action
can
be
brought
in
state
courts
as
well
as
federal?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
hanemann,
in
section
1
of
dohsa,
it
says
the
personal
representative
of
the
decedent
may
maintain
a
suit
for
damages
in
the
district
courts
of
the
united
states
in
admiralty,
and
as
i
glance
through
the
statute
here...
i
would
be
the
first
to
admit
i
am
not
an
admiralty
lawyer...
i
don't
see
anything
that
seems
to
authorize
a
suit
in
state
courts
under
dohsa.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
hamilton
involved
the
dohsa?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
before
the--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--so
this
court
has
never
held
that
a
state
court
has
jurisdiction
over
a
dohsa
claim.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
those
cases
were
certainly
the
legal
environment
in
which
the
dohsa
was
passed,
were
they
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
when
dohsa
was
finally
passed,
southern
pacific
v.
jensen
was
on
the
books
as
good
law.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it
was
there
for
long
or
not
because
dohsa
was
passed
at
a
particular
moment
in
time.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
your
view,
is
it
a
question
of
the
domicile
of
the
individual
plaintiff?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
so,
in
a
case
brought
in
louisiana,
the
federal
court
sitting
in
louisiana
would
apply
louisiana
conflicts
laws
to
decide
whether
a
florida
plaintiff
would
recover
under
florida
law
or,
say,
louisiana
law?
