powell,

may
i
ask
this
question,
please?
were
all
of
the
people
on
this
helicopter
citizens
of
louisiana?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
how
many
people
were
on
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
suppose
each
of
the
13
had
come
from
a
different
state
and
each
state
had
different
laws?
would
not
the
recovery
by
each
person
differ
and
perhaps
widely,
and
would
that
be
fair?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
would
be
as
fair
as
what?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
are
you
suggesting
there
could
be
no
difference
in
the
damages
recovered
in
the
hypothetical
i
suggested
for--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--assume
one
state
provided
treble
damages
and
the
other
state
did
not.
there
would
manifestly
be
a
difference
if
both
persons
were
killed
and
the
same
survivors
are
entitled
to
sue.
