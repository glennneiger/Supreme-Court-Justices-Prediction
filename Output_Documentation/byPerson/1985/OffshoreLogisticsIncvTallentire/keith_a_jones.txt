mr.
keith
a.
jones
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
arises
from
the
crash
of
a
helicopter
on
the
high
seas.
the
crash
occurred
in
the
gulf
of
mexico,
approximately
35
miles
from
land.
all
persons
on
board
were
killed.
the
operator
of
the
helicopter,
offshore
logistics,
conceded
in
the
district
court
that
it
is
liable
for
damages
under
the
federal
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
which
is
known
by
its
acronym
dohsa.
that
statute
provides
for
the
recovery
of
pecuniary
damages,
but
it
does
not
allow
the
award
of
nonpecuniary
or
sentimental
damages.
the
case
is
here
because
the
plaintiffs
contend
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
offshore
logistics
additionally
is
liable
for
sentimental
damages
under
state
law.
the
theory
of
the
plaintiffs
and
that
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
that
state
law
may
be
invoked
and
applied
as
a
means
of
supplementing
dohsa
and
enlarging
the
recoveries
for
wrongful
death
on
the
high
seas.
we
disagree.
our
position
is
that
dohsa
is
exclusive,
that
the
availability
of
a
uniform
maritime
rule
of
recovery
makes
the
parallel
of
supplemental
enforcement
of
state
law
both
unnecessary
and
inappropriate.
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
our
position
because,
it
held,
that
enforcement
of
state
law
is
required
by
what
it
called
the
clear
mandate
of
section
7
of
dohsa.
that
holding
defines
the
core
issue
in
this
case,
that
is,
whether
section
7
actually
does
mandate
enforcement
of
state
law
on
the
high
seas.
we
submit
that
plaintiffs
cannot
prevail
in
this
case
unless
section
7
affirmatively
directs
federal
admiralty
courts
to
enforce
state
wrongful
death
statutes
on
the
high
seas.
we
further
submit
that
section
7
issues
no
such
directive.
before
i
turn
to
the
construction
of
section
7,
let
me
begin
by
assuming
that
for
purposes
of
argument
that
section
7
is
merely
neutral,
that
it
neither
prohibits
nor
requires
the
enforcement
of
state
law
on
the
high
seas.
in
this
event,
the
proper
role
of
state
law
will
be
left
for
judicial
determination
in
accordance
with
the
governing
principles
of
admiralty,
and
there
can
be
no
serious
question
about
the
outcome.
federal
courts
would
not
be
required
to
enforce
state
law
on
the
high
seas,
and
they
would
not
do
so.
the
courts
would
not
be
required
to
enforce
state
law
because
admiralty
is
a
federal
common
law
jurisdiction
in
which
state
law
does
not
operate
of
its
own
force.
this
court
has
refused
to
apply
state
law
even
in
cases
arising
on
the
territorial
waters
and
involving
issues
on
which
congress
has
not
spoken.
it
follows
a
fortiori
that
admiralty
courts
have
no
obligation
to
enforce
state
law
in
cases
arising
not
in
the
territorial
waters
but
on
the
high
seas
and
involving
issues
on
which
congress
already
has
spoken
by
providing
a
uniform
maritime
rule.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
one
marine
league,
your
honor.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
understand
that's
just
a
little
bit
more
than
three
geographic
miles.
i
think
it
is
the
equivalent
of
three
nautical
miles.
i
think
the
purpose
of
dohsa
was
to
define
the
territorial
boundary
of
the
united
states
or
to
conform
with
that
boundary.
not
only
would
federal
admiralty
courts
not
be
required
to
enforce
state
law
in
those
circumstances,
it
is
clear
that
they
would
not
do
so.
the
purpose
of
the
constitutional
framers
in
conferring
admiralty
jurisdiction
on
the
federal
courts
was
to
ensure
the
preservation
and
development
of
a
coherent
and
uniform
body
of
maritime
law.
admiralty
law
historically
has
been
shaped
and
governed
by
this
constitutional
policy
of
maritime
uniformity.
from
time
to
time
the
courts
have
borrowed
from
state
law
in
order
to
fill
a
void
in
maritime
law,
but
that
practice
has
marked
the
limit
of
admiralty's
tolerance
for
nonuniformity.
admiralty
courts
do
not
offer
diversity
when
there
is
a
national
admiralty
rule
already
at
hand.
this
is
especially
true
on
the
high
seas
where
the
essential
features
of
an
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction
are
at
issue.
the
plaintiffs
appear
to
suggest
that
this
constitutional
policy
of
maritime
uniformity
covers
only
duties
of
care
and
that
there
is
no
federal
interest
in
uniform
remedies.
it
is
by
no
means
clear
that
the
decision
below
contemplates
only
the
enforcement
of
state
remedies
and
not
of
state
duties
of
care.
but
be
that
as
it
may,
the
plaintiffs'
argument
is
simply
wrong.
one
of
the
earliest
cases
stressing
the
need
for
maritime
uniformity,
chelentis
v.
luckenbach,
specifically
involved
the
question
of
remedy,
and
in
that
case
this
court
held
that
a
state
remedy
of
full
indemnification
would
not
and
could
not
be
substituted
for
the
more
limited
general
maritime
remedy
of
maintenance
and
cure.
the
doctrine
of
maritime
uniformity
plainly
embraces
remedies
as
well
as
duties
of
care.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
no,
your
honor,
i
am
still
operating
under
the
initial
assumption
that
section
7
is
neutral.
i
will
get--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
--well,
our
basic
submission
here
is
that
section
7
does
not
command
the
enforcement
of
state
law
on
the
high
seas.
let
us
turn
to
the
language
of
section
7.
it
provides,
and
i
quote,
"the
provisions
of
any
state
statute
giving
or
regulating
rights
of
action
or
remedies
for
death
shall
not
be
affected.
"
now.
i
agree
that
at
first
blush
this
language
may
appear
to
be
suggestive,
but
the
closer
one
looks,
the
less
meaningful
it
appears.
to
say
that
the
provisions
of
state
law
are
not
affected
is
not
to
say
that
state
law
can,
let
alone
that
it
must,
be
enforced
on
the
high
seas.
and
this
is
no
mere
gramatical
quibble.
in
section
4
of
dohsa
congress
expressly
directed
federal
admiralty
courts
to
enforce
foreign
law
on
the
high
seas.
if
congress
had
intended
to
issue
the
same
kind
of
directive
with
respect
to
state
law,
it
would
have
used
similar
language.
it
would
have
specified
in
the
same
manner
as
in
section
4
that
rights
of
action
for
wrongful
death
on
the
high
seas
based
upon
state
law
may
be
maintained
in
admiralty.
but
congress
did
not
do
so.
instead,
the
language
of
section
7
is,
as
representative
goodykoontz
observed
on
the
floor
of
the
house,
and
i
quote,
"not
unlike
mohammed's
coffin,
suspended
between
heaven
and
earth,
having
no
application
to
anything
in
particular.
"
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
i
think
that
there
is
a
lot
to
be
said
about
what
representative
mann
had
in
mind,
but
let
me
first
point
out
that
for
60
years
following
the
enactment
of
dohsa,
this
language
of
section
7
has
been
treated
by
all
leading
admiralty
commentators
as
nothing
more
than
a
saving
clause,
as
providing
nothing
more
than
that
state
law
may
be
used
where
federal
law,
where
the
federal
remedy
does
not
apply.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
the
saving
to
suitors
clause
basically
is
a
provision
that
permits
the
use
of
a
state
forum.
the
saving
to
suitors
clause
is
somewhat
different
from
this
provision,
but
i
think
what
people
understood
section
7
as
providing
is
that
where
the
federal
remedy
does
not
apply,
the
state
remedies
may
still
be
enforced
in
admiralty.
now,
it
is
true
that
recently
the
lower
court
and
a
handful
of
other
district
courts,
out
of
apparent
dissatisfaction
of
dohsa's
limitation
of
recovery
to
pecuniary
damages,
have
sought
to
supplement
it
with
remedies
borrowed
from
state
law,
but
in
doing
so,
they
have
disregarded
this
court's
instruction
in
mobil
oil
v.
higginbotham
that,
and
i
quote,
"congress
did
not
limit
dohsa
beneficiaries
to
recovery
of
their
pecuniary
losses
in
order
to
encourage
the
creation
of
nonpecuniary
supplements.
"
"and
the
lower
court's
departure
from
higginbotham
is
not
justified
by
their
vague
and
cryptic
language
of
section
7.
"
and
i
don't
think
it's
justified
by
the
legislative
history
either,
either
of
dohsa
as
a
whole
or
section
7
in
particular.
the
legislative
history
of
dohsa
as
a
whole,
as
set
forth
in
the
committee
reports,
reveals
that
congress
intended
to
establish
a
uniform
and
exclusive
remedy
for
wrongful
death
on
the
high
seas,
and
the
bill's
sponsor,
representative
montague,
explained
during
floor
debate,
section
7
was
merely
put
in
out
of
abundant
caution
to
calm
the
minds
of
those
who
think
that
rights
within
the
territorial
waters
will
be
usurped
by
the
national
law.
now,
to
be
sure,
this
statement
was
made
before
section
7
was
amended
on
the
floor
of
the
house,
but
that
amendment,
representative
mann's
amendment,
would
not
have
the
effect
of
defeating
the
original
and
expressly
stated
legislative
purposes
of
uniformity
and
exclusivity.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
justice
o'connor,
i
think
no
parsing
of
the
floor
debate
can
make
crystal
clear
what
either
representative
mann's
intention
was
or
the
intention
of
the
house
as
a
whole.
representative
mann
offered
his
amendment
out
of
a
confusion
of
motives.
he
wanted
to
ensure
that
state
law
would
continue
to
apply
in
all
territorial
waters,
whether
or
not
they
were
within
one
marine
league
of
shore.
he
also
wanted
to
provide
for
concurrent
federal
and
state
court
jurisdiction
over
actions
arising
under
dohsa.
now,
those
appear
to
have
been
his
dominant
motives,
and
they
do
not
bear
upon
this
case
one
way
or
the
other.
now,
representative
mann's
third
motive,
if
indeed
he
had
a
third
motive,
was
to
preserve
existing
state
court
jurisdiction
over
actions
predicated
upon
state
law.
but
what
was
that
existing
state
court
jurisdiction?
representative
mann
himself,
during
the
debate
on
an
earlier
version
of
this
bill,
stated
explicitly
that
state
courts
have
no
jurisdiction
over
accidents
on
the
high
seas.
now,
the
plaintiffs
appear
to
suggest,
and
a
theme
that
runs
through
the
decision
below,
is
that
the
purpose
of
the
amendment
was
to
codify
the
holding
of
the
hamilton.
but
representative
mann
himself
never
said
so.
and
what
the
court
below
and
the
plaintiffs
overlook
is
that
the
hamilton
did
not
approve
a
direct
action
for
wrongful
death
under
state
law.
the
holding
of
the
hamilton
is
that
a
federal
admiralty
court,
in
the
absence
of
a
national
admiralty
rule,
when
congress
has
not
spoken,
will
apply
state
wrongful
death
law,
but
only
in
a
special
set
of
circumstances,
only
when
the
owner
of
the
vessel
has
invoked
the
protection
of
admiralty
by
initiating
a
special
federal
statutory
proceeding
to
limit
liability.
the
congressional
reports,
the
committee
reports
on
dohsa
noted
the
narrowness
of
this
holding.
they
stated,
and
i
quote,
"the
right
to
affirmative
action
in
the
admiralty
against
ship
or
owner
has
never
been
sustained
by
the
supreme
court.
"
and
represented
igoe
repeated
this
point
during
the
floor
debate.
the
general
understanding
at
the
time,
as
this
court
noted
in
its
decision
in
moragne,
was
that
state
law
did
not
apply
beyond
state
boundaries.
insofar
as
deaths
on
the
high
seas
was
concerned,
there
simply
was
no
existing
state
court
jurisdiction,
and
there
was
no
direct
action
for
wrongful
death
under
state
law
to
be
preserved.
finally,
floor
debate
on
representative
mann's
amendment
was
repeatedly
punctuated
by
the
assertion
made
by
several
members
of
the
house
that
adoption
of
the
amendment
would
have
no
effect
on
the
exclusivity
of
the
new
federal
remedy
on
the
high
seas.
one
may
assume,
indeed,
one
must
assume
that
the
amendment
was
adopted
at
least
in
part
in
reliance
upon
those
representations.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
if
by
that
you
mean
whether
this
court
has
decided
it,
i
don't
think
the
court
has
ever
had
occasion
to,
but
i
think
it
is
generally
understood
that
a
cause
of
action
can
be
maintained
in
state
court.
we
submit
that
viewed
realistically,
the
adoption
of
representative
mann's
amendment
did
not
represent
a
retreat
from
the
expressly
stated
legislative
purpose
of
providing
a
uniform
and
exclusive
remedy
for
wrongful
death
on
the
high
seas.
now,
the
plaintiffs
argue
that--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
--i'm
referring
to
the
committee
reports
on
dohsa.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
actually,
the
committee
report
consists
of
nothing
but
letters.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
the
committee
reports
really
contain...
really
are
nothing
more
than
three
letters,
three
or
four
letters,
as
i
recall.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
correct.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
the
committee
really
said
nothing
other
than
that
these
letters
were
the
basis
for
its
action.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
floor
debate
did
not
go
to
the
act
at
large;
it
only
was
focusing
on
section
7.
section
7
i
think
was
the
only
provision
that
was
amended
on
the
floor
of
the
house.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
if
dohsa
had
never
been
passed
at
all,
we
would
be
left
with
the
position
that
we
were
in
in
1919
where
the
supreme
court
could
either
deny
a
remedy
altogether,
as
it
did
in
the
harrisburg,
or
it
could
recognize
a
general
maritime
remedy
for
wrongful
death
as
it
subsequently
did
in
moragne,
and
extend
that
remedy
to
the
high
seas
as
it
decided
it
was
precluded
from
doing
in
higginbotham.
or
it
could
adjudicate
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
determining
whether
in
special
circumstances
it
would
give
effect
to
state
law
in
the
absence
of
the
federal
remedy.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
oh,
no,
oh,
no.
our
argument
is
that
the
existence
of
a
national
uniform
admiralty
rule
precludes
the
parallel
enforcement
of
state
law
unless
congress
in
fact
has
required
admiralty
courts
to
enforce
state
law.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
that
would
have
been
up
to
the
supreme
court
to
determine.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
assume
this
court
would
extend
moragne
to
the
high
seas.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
think
that
would
preclude
state
law.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
two
courts
of
appeals
have
so
held.
this
court
has
never
ruled
on
that.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
under
the
subsequent
decision
in
godet,
the
moragne
remedy
would
allow
nonpecuniary...
recovery
of
certain
nonpecuniary
damages.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
is
correct.
that
is
what
this
court
recognized
in
its
decision
in
higginbotham
where
it
pointed
out
that
the
result
was
one
national
rule
for
the
territorial
waters,
and
a
slightly
narrower
national
rule
for
the
high
seas.
the
court
has
explicitly
identified
that
anomaly
in
higginbotham.
let
me
address
one
more
point
with
respect
to
the
wording
of
section
7.
plaintiffs
point
out
that
that
wording
before
its
amendment
would
have
prohibited
application
of
state
law
on
the
high
seas
by
what
they
call
negative
implication.
if
so,
the
amendment
did
nothing
more
than
remove
a
negatively
implied
prohibition
from
one
provision
of
the
bill
without
substituting
in
its
place
a
positive
directive
to
enforce
state
law.
consequently,
even
if
the
amendment
could
be
portrayed
as
a
retreat
from
an
original
intention
of
actually
requiring
federal
exclusivity
on
the
high
seas,
it
was
at
most
only
a
partial
and
tactical
retreat
to
a
posture
of
congressional
neutrality.
if
adoption
of
the
amendment
means
anything
at
all
with
respect
to
the
role
of
state
law
on
the
high
seas,
it
means
no
more
than
that
congress,
having
been
advised
that
the
courts
would
hold
the
federal
remedy
to
be
exclusive,
whether
or
not
section
7
was
amended,
decided
simply
to
leave
the
matter
to
the
courts
without
itself
either
prohibiting
or
requiring
enforcement
of
state
law.
now,
as
i
said
earlier,
if
the
matter
is
left
to
the
courts,
it
is
clear
what
the
courts
would
decide.
the
extension
of
a
hodgepodge
of
differing
and
conflicting
state
laws
under
the
high
seas
would
make
a
mockery
of
the
notion
of
maritime
uniformity.
as
judge
jolly
said
in
his
somewhat
reluctant
concurring
opinion
below,
application
of
state
law
would
make
a
mess
in
more
than
a
few
cases.
it
would
make
a
mess.
application
of
state
law
on
the
high
seas
would
meet
with
no
apparent
limiting
principle
to
constrain
or
define
its
applicability.
we
would
be
faced
with
the
prospect,
the
rather
bizarre
prospect,
of
kansas
law
applying
in
the
persian
gulf
or
arizona
law
applying
on
the
north
sea.
such
extraterritorial
applications
of
state
law
is
patently
anomalous,
and
even
if,
even
if
state
law,
the
adoption
of
state
law
were
limited
to
remedies,
that
would
renew
tensions
and
discrepancies
that
result
from
the
necessity
to
accommodate
state
remedial
statutes
to
exclusively
federal
maritime
subsidy
concepts,
precisely
the
tensions
and
discrepancies
that
this
court
tried
to
bring
to
an
end
in
its
decision
in
moragne.
but
in
fact,
the
question
of
engrafting
state
remedies,
of
engrafting
supplemental
remedies
onto
dohsa
already
has
been
decided,
assuming
that
state
law
is
not
mandated
by
congress
because
this
court
in
its
decision
in
higginbotham
held
that
state
law...
i'm
sorry,
that
dohsa
will
not
be
supplemented
or
displaced
even
by
a
uniform,
judge-made
remedy.
that
was
the
decision
in
higginbotham,
and
the
basis
for
that
decision
was
that
federal
common
law
power
of
rulemaking
permits
federal
courts
to
devise
general
maritime
rules,
would
not
be
exercised
when
congress
already
has
provided
a
uniform
maritime
rule.
that
reasoning
applies
here
with
even
greater
force
because
the
borrowing
of
state
law
not
only
would
displace
dohsa
but
introduce
widespread
disuniformity
as
well.
for
these
reasons,
we
submit
that
the
governing
principles
of
admiralty,
including
in
particular
the
constitutional
policy
of
maritime
uniformity,
preclude
supplemental
enforcement
of
state
law.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
yes,
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
plaintiffs
fail
to
recognize
that
admiralty
law
is
different
from
conventional
interstate
commerce
law.
state
statute
do
not
apply
of
their
own
force
in
admiralty,
and
preemption
does
not
require
a
federal
statute.
the
decision
in
chelentis,
for
example,
illustrates
this
point.
uniformity
in
chelentis
is
provided
by
judge-made
rules,
not
by
a
congressional
prohibition,
express
or
implied.
decisions
like
chelentis
and
kossick,
pope
&
talbot
all
stand
for
the
proposition
that
the
availability
of
a
uniform
national
maritime
rule
itself
precludes
enforcement
of
state
law.
there
need
be
no
congressional
prohibition,
express
or
implied.
let
me
address
a
moment
the
question
of
the
hamilton
again.
mr.
justice
stevens
read
an
extract
from
that
opinion
by
justice
holmes,
and
that
opinion
is
divided
into
two
parts,
as
i
recall.
in
the
first
part
justice
holmes
established
that
state
law
is
valid,
that
the
state
law
in
question
was
valid.
but
then
he
went
on
to
consider
the
question
whether
that
law
would
be
applied
in
admiralty,
and
one
of
the
crucial
considerations
that
he
discusses
in
that
connection
was
that
this
was
a
case
brought
in
admiralty
to
limit
liability.
it
was
a
special
federal
statutory
proceeding
to
limit
liability,
and
the
hamilton
does
not
stand
generally
for
the
proposition
that
state
wrongful
death
statutes
could
be
enforced
in
admiralty
in
direct
actions.
and
that
is
what
the
congression...
the
committee
reports
pointed
out.
moreover,
the
first
part
of
the
hamilton
may
well
not
have
survived
the
decisions
in
jensen
and
chelentis
that
followed
it
by
about
ten
years.
after
those
decisions,
the
supreme
court
confronted
once
again
the
question
of
whether
a
state
wrongful
death
statute
would
be
applied,
this
time
in
territorial
waters.
this
is
the
garcia
case.
and
in
that
case,
the
court
said
that
because
in
territorial
waters
the
event
was
maritime
and
local
in
character,
state
law
could
apply.
if
the
hamilton
had
decided
more
generally
that
state
wrongful
death
statutes
applied
on
the
high
seas,
there
would
have
been
no
need
for
the
maritime
but
local
in
character
ruling
of
garcia.
moreover,
dohsa
was
enacted
in
the
context
of
jenson
and
chelentis,
and
in
that
context,
the
members
of
the
house
recognized
that
the
supreme
court
at
that
time
would
hold
the
federal
rule
to
be
exclusive
no
matter
how
section
7
was
amended.
with
that
in
mind,
congress
amended
section
7,
leaving
it
to
the
courts
under
what
it
assumed
to
be
the
governing
doctrine
of
jensen
and
chelentis,
of
the
day.
at
bottom,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
plaintiffs
want
to
do
away
with
admiralty
as
a
special,
separate
federal
jurisdiction.
they
want
to
assimilate
admiralty
to
the
law
of
coastal
states
and
the
adjacent
platforms.
but
regardless
of
the
merits
of
such
a
suggestion,
it
just
wouldn't
work.
there
are
enormous
choice
of
law
problems
on
the
high
seas.
choice
of
law
problems
are
obviously
far
more
difficult
there
than
in
the
territorial
waters
where
an
event
actually
occurs
within
the
boundaries
of
an
individual
state.
this
court
in
lauritzen
v.
larsen
listed
seven
factors
that
bear
upon
the
choice
of
law
in
the
high
seas,
even
when
it's
only
a
matter
of
choosing
which
nation's
law
would
apply.
if
we
were
to
extend
the
separate
laws
of
50
states
on
the
high
seas
as
well,
the
question
of
choice
of
law
would
be
enormously
complicated.
i
have
nothing
further,
your
honor.
