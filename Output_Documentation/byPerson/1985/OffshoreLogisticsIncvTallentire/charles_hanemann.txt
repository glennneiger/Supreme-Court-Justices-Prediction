mr.
charles
hanemann
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
want
to
launch
right
into
this
language
of
section
7
which,
if
you
see
where
the
legislative
were
coming
from,
is
the
farthest
thing
from
neutral.
when
this
bill
had
been
introduced
before
on
numerous
occasions,
it
contained
language
to
the
effect
that
in
all
cases
of
death
on
the
high
seas,
admiralty
courts
shall
have
exclusive
jurisdiction,
and
this
shall
be
the
exclusive
remedy.
those
bills
never
passed.
they
were
up
for
years.
i
have
cited
them
in
my
brief,
and
they
never
passed.
those
who
militated
then
for
exclusive
jurisdiction
and
an
exclusive
remedy
didn't
get
away
with
it.
mr.
charles
hanemann
section
1
is
permissive,
justice
rehnquist.
it
says
may
maintain,
personal
representatives
may
maintain.
the
constitution
creates
this
federal
system
that
we
have,
and
the
savings
to
suitors
clause
preserves
the
right
to
go
to
state
courts,
and
this
court
recognized
in
the
hamilton
that
state
courts,
state
created
remedies
for
wrongful
death
may
be
sued
upon.
in
the
subsequent
cases--
mr.
charles
hanemann
--oh,
the
hamilton
was
1907--
mr.
charles
hanemann
--thirteen
years
before
dohsa.
mr.
charles
hanemann
no,
it
has
not,
but
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
and
research,
neither
has
that
position
ever
been
advanced
to
you.
but
to
come
back
to
section
7
and
what
happened
to
it?
the
unsuccessful
bills
sought
to
be
exclusive
just
like
the
petitioners
would
have
the
court
construe
those
today.
then
in
the
1920
bill
this
language
was
offered
to
the
house.
the
provisions
of
section
7,
the
provisions
of
any
state
statute
giving
or
regulating
rights
of
action
or
remedies
for
death
shall
not
be
affected
by
this
act.
now,
the
act
that's
before
you
stopped
right
there.
the
one
that
was
before
the
house
went
on
to
say
"as
to
causes
of
action
accruing
within
the
territorial
limits
within
the
state.
"
as
to
causes
of
action
accruing
within
the
territorial
waters
of
the
state.
that
would
have
resulted,
perhaps,
in
a
result
such
as
the
petitioners
argue
for
because
if
dohsa
doesn't
affect
remedies
created
by
state
law
as
to
causes
of
action
accruing
within
the
territorial
limits
of
any
state,
then
maybe
dohsa
does
supplant
and
preempt
state
created
remedies
which,
by
reason
of
the
hamilton,
would
apply
on
the
high
seas.
but
that's
what
mr.
mann's
amendment
took
out.
he
took
out
"as
to
causes
of
action
accruing
within
the
territorial
limits
of
any
state.
"
so
now
it
just
says
dohsa
won't
affect
state
created
remedies,
period.
no
longer
is
that
savings
clause
limited
to
the
territorial
waters
of
the
state.
that
savings
clause
is
all-inclusive.
boiled
down
to
its
simplest
terms,
the
petitioners'
position
is
that
state
death
acts,
which
this
court
once
held
in
the
hamilton
do
afford
a
remedy
on
the
high
seas,
no
longer
apply
there
because
dohsa
has
preempted
them,
but
the
very
statute
on
which
they...
on
which
the
petitioner
relies
saves
whatever
force
state
statutes
have,
and
you
have
already
held
in
the
hamilton
that
state
death
acts
do
apply
on
the
high
seas.
now,
we
can
argue
this
case
for
the
remainder
of
the
hour,
and
we
have
briefed
hundreds
of
pages,
but
that's
what
it
boils
down
to.
the
petitioners
say
that
the
statute
preempts
state
death
remedies
on
the
high
seas,
and
we
say
the
statute
saves
them.
mr.
charles
hanemann
i
don't
think
they
ever
took
a
good
look
at
the
legislative
history
or
section
7,
justice
o'connor.
in
the
nygaard
decision
out
of
the
ninth
circuit,
which
is
the
case
with
which
the
tallentire
decision,
our
case,
conflicts,
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
even
cite
section
7.
there
was
a
line
of
older
cases,
most
exemplary
of
which
is
wilson
v.
transocean
airlines
in
which
the
district
court
i
think
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
did
address
the
matter
of
section
7
and
called
it
simply
an
innocuous
change
in
language.
i
don't
think
it's
an
innocuous
change
in
language.
i
think
that's
a
little
shallow
to
approach
this,
and
the
harrisburg
was
the
law
from
1874
until
you
decided
the
moragne
case,
and
everybody
thought
that
the
harrisburg
precluded
a
federal
death
action
in
admiralty,
and
you
did
not
let
that
erroneous
view
preclude
you
from
reaching
a
just
decision
in
the
moragne
case.
and
i
would
not
hold
to
the
view
that
old
error
is
good
error.
nor
would
i
hold
to
the
view
that
error
is
somehow
sanctified
by
the
universality
of
its
acceptance,
and
i
think
this
is
a
good
opportunity
for
the
court
to
straighten
out
the
error
that
has
persisted
if
such
it
is.
however,
the
error
has
not
been
universal
because
we
cited
the
safir
case
and
a
number
of
other
cases
from
the
lower
courts
which
hold
the
opposite
view,
rairigh
v.
erlbeck,
etcetera,
which
hold
the
opposite
view,
and
that
is
that
section
7
does
indeed
say
the
state
created
remedies
on
the
high
seas.
mr.
jones'
argument
proceeds
from
the
assumption,
i
think,
that
one
federal
statute
in
a
field
preempts
all
state
action
in
the
field.
alexander
hamilton,
writing
in
"the
federalist"
certainly
would
not
have
shared
that
view.
according
to
mr.
hamilton,
federal
law
is
exclusive
only
in
three
situations:
first
of
all,
where
the
constitution
in
express
terms
grants
an
exclusive
authority
to
the
state.
that's
not
the...
to
the
federal
government,
pardon
me.
that
certainly
is
not
the
case
here.
the
second
case
where
the
federal
government...
federal
legislation,
rather
excludes
state
legislation,
is
where
the
constitution
expressly
grants
a
power,
though
perhaps
not
explicitly
exclusive
to
the
federal
government,
and
also
says
that
the
state
shall
not
do
it.
that
is
certainly
not
the
case
here.
the
third
situation
is,
according
to
mr.
hamilton,
where
the
constitution
granted
an
authority
to
the
union
to
which
a
similar
authority
in
the
states
would
be
absolutely
and
totally
contradictory
and
repugnant.
let
me
remind
you
that
justice
charles
evans
hughes,
writing
in
the
case
of
just
v.
chambers
said
uniformity
is
required
only
when
the
legislation...
when
the
essential
features
of
an
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction
are
involved,
but
as
admiralty
takes
cognizance
of
maritime
torts,
there
is
no
repugnancy
to
its
characteristic
features,
either
in
permitting
recovery
for
wrongful
death
or
in
allowing
compensation
for
a
wrong
to
the
living
to
be
obtained
from
a
tortfeasor's
estate.
chief
justice
hughes
echoed
the
very
words
that
mr.
hamilton
used
in
just
v.
chambers
with
direct
reference
to
a
state
death
action
applied
on
navigable
waters.
now,
that...
those
were
navigable
waters
of
a
state,
i'll
grant
you,
but
it's
perfectly
consistent
with
what
you
did
in
the
hamilton,
and
if
the
application
of
state
law
on
the
high
seas...
rather,
on
the
navigable
waters
of
a
state
is
not
repugnant,
then
i
see
no
conceptual
reason
why
the
application
of
state
law
on
the
high
seas
should
be
any
different.
mr.
charles
hanemann
well,
justice
o'connor,
that
is
not
our
case,
and
i
don't
presume
to
trace
the
outer
limits
of
the
effect
of
your
decision
in
this
case.
however,
i
would
point
out
to
you
that
if
ever
there
was
a
case
that
is
maritime
but
local,
this
is
it
because
we
have
people
living
in
louisiana,
working
off
louisiana's
coast
on
the
louisiana
offshore
platforms,
and
it
is
a
very
highly
louisiana
case.
mr.
charles
hanemann
i
might
be
if
the
louisiana
connections
were
there
like
they
are
in
this
case,
because
you
held
in
the
hamilton
that
a
statute...
and
this
is
a
quote
from
justice
holmes...
a
statute
giving
damages,
meaning
a
state
statute,
giving
damages
for
death
caused
by
a
tort
might
be
enforced
in
a
state
court
even
though
the
tort
was
committed
at
sea.
now,
at
sea
has
a
very
broad
reach,
and
i
am
only...
i
don't,
i
don't
have
any
reservations
about
the
applicability
of
state
law
in
the
waters
overlying
the
shelf
and
perhaps
in
waters
more
distant
than
that.
but
i
really
would
not
presume
to
trace
just
how
far,
whether
it
could
go
to
the
gulf
of
aqaba
or
some
other
place.
if
the
connections
were
there,
though,
i
see
no
reason
why
they
should
not,
nor
did
congress,
because
congress
said
that
dohsa
will
not
affect
them
wherever
they
have
effect,
and
we
know
from
the
hamilton
that
they
go
at
least
as
far
as
our
case.
mr.
charles
hanemann
and
so
do
i.
it's
just
that
i
wouldn't
presume
to
draw
the...
to
try
to
trace
the
farthest
reaches.
to
me,
if
you
can
apply
it
four
miles,
if
you
can
apply
the
state
law
four
miles
off
the
coast,
there
seems
little
conceptual
reason
why
not
to
apply
it
100
or
400
or
five.
i
don't
retreat
from
that
at
all.
now,
mr.
jones
made
reference
to
the
higginbotham
case,
and
of
course,
we
cannot
escape
reference
to
the
higginbotham
case
in
this
discussion.
let
me
remind
you
that
no
one
in
the
higginbotham
case
contended
that
state
law
government
that
was
a
straight
conflict
between
dohsa
and
the
general
maritime
death
action
announced
in
moragne.
you
held
in
the
higginbotham
that
dohsa
is
the
national
admiralty
rule
and
supplants
moragne,
but
you
also
said
in
higginbotham...
beg
your
pardon,
in
moragne,
in
moragne,
dohsa,
"does
not
by
its
own
force
abrogate
available
state
remedies.
"
so
whatever
the...
why
the
people,
why
the
plaintiffs
in
the
higginbotham
case
did
not
militate
for
the
application
of
state
law,
i
do
not
know,
but
the
fact
is
that
state
law
was
not
advanced
by
any
party
in
the
higginbotham
case,
nor
was
section
7
of
dohsa
relied
upon
as
saving
stage
law
by
any
party
in
the
higginbotham
case.
mr....
the
petitioner
further
advances
the
proposition
that
any
state...
that
any
state
remedy
is
automatically
ousted
when
there
is
a
federal
statute
on
the
point,
and
relies
heavily
on
jensen
and
knickerbocker,
the
decisions
in
both
of
which
were
written
around
1917,
1920
by
justice
mcreynolds
and
also
chelentis
v.
luckenbach,
which
was
written
by
justice
mcreynolds.
well,
i
don't
think
i
have
to
remind
the
court
that
as
justice
frankfurter
said
in
kossick,
certainly
no
more
decision
in
the
court's
history
has
been
progenitor
of
more
lasting
dissatisfaction
and
disharmony
with
a
particular
area
of
law
than
southern
pacific
company
v.
jensen.
it
is
easily
one
of
the...
jensen
and
knickerbocker
are
easily
two
of
the
most
widely
criticized
decisions
that
this
court
has
ever
issues.
this
court
as--
mr.
charles
hanemann
--they
were
more
or
less
in
the
same
timeframe.
however,
efforts
to
pass
dohsa
as
an
exclusive
bill
had
been
going
on
since
the
turn
of
the
century,
about
1900,
and
every
time
it
came
up
exclusive,
it
was
voted
down.
mr.
charles
hanemann
it
was
on
the
books,
but
if
it
was
there
as
good
law,
it
wasn't
there
for
long
because
it
was--
mr.
charles
hanemann
--yes.
dohsa
was
passed
in
1920,
and
jensen
was
decided
in
1917,
but
this
court
has
never
applied
jensen
or
knickerbocker
to
preclude
the
operation
of
any
state
statute
except
a
state
workmen's
compensation
statute,
and
even
vis-a-vis
state
workmen's
compensation
statute,
really,
the
very
next
chance
you
had
to
do
so,
you
found
a
way
for
state
workmen's
compensation
statutes
even
to
apply
on
navigable
waters,
and
that
was
grant
smith-porter
v.
rohde.
so
three,
four,
five
years
after
jensen,
already
you
were
letting
state
compensation,
workmen's
compensation
statutes
apply
where
jensen,
if
you
read
it
strictly,
had
said
they
would
not.
and
in
many,
many
instances
you
have
allowed
state
laws
not
dealing
with
workmen's
compensation
to
apply.
wrongful
death
has
been
applied...
state
wrongful
death
has
been
applied
many
times
since
the
jensen
decision,
just
v.
chambers,
western
fuel
v.
garcia,
many
other
cases.
you
have
let
state
lien
laws
apply
on
navigable
waters,
state
laws
for
the
partitions
of
ships,
state
laws
on
arbitration,
state
laws
on
maritime
insurance,
state
unemployment
insurance
laws,
state
water
pollution
laws
just
recently
here
in
askew
v.
american
waterways
operators.
mr.
charles
hanemann
i
cannot
remember
that.
the
citizen...
the
pilot
was
a
citizen
of
florida,
as
i
recall,
and
i
know
that
some
of
the
other
people
were
citizens
of
louisiana.
mr.
charles
hanemann
as
memory
serves,
it
was
either
12
or
13,
and
all
were
killed.
mr.
charles
hanemann
it
would
certainly
be
as
fair
as
denying
them
recovery.
mr.
charles
hanemann
it
would
certainly
be
as
fair
as
denying
them
recovery
for
what
the
petitioner
i
think
somewhat
calls
sentimental
damages.
i
don't
think
it
is
fair
to
deny
people
certain
real
damages
even
though
they
may
have
to
do
with
sentiment,
but
to
come
back
to
your
specific
question,
as
justice
brennan
pointed
out
right
in
the
congress,
as
i
recall,
there
was...
these
state
wrongful
death
laws
have
been
applied
on
navigable
waters
for
many,
many
years,
and
there
has
never
been
any
serious...
there
has
never
been
any
serious
difficulty
with
them.
and
if
there
were
any
difficulty,
i
think
it
would
be
nothing
more
than
an
accustomed
exercise
in
conflicts
of
laws.
most
jurisdictions
now
favor
a
weighing
of
contexts.
most
courts
are
very
familiar
with
that
process,
and
the
courts
can
do
that,
and
the
courts
can
reap
substantial
justice
in
all
cases,
i
think,
by
a
balancing
and
a
weighing
of
contacts.
so
yes,
certainly
there
would
be
some
differences,
but
in
the
hamilton,
too,
the
court
pointed
out,
justice
holmes
pointed
out
that
there
would
be
no
lamentable
lack
of
uniformity
in
applying
state
death
actions
on
the
high
seas.
in
just
v.
chambers,
you
said
there
would
be
no
repugnancy
to
federal
law
in
allowing
state
death
actions
to
control,
and
to
me,
what's
more
repugnant
to
bona
fide
admiralty
concepts
is
to
deny
these
real
damages,
to--
mr.
charles
hanemann
--well--
mr.
charles
hanemann
--yes,
there
certainly
could
be
a
different
measure
of
damages.
however,
you
surveyed
the
law
in,
as
i
recall,
the
gaudet
case,
and
you
relied...
you
cited
speiser's
work
on
wrongful
death,
and
speiser's
work
on
wrongful
death
pointed
out
that
across
the
country,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
a
clear
majority
of
the
states
allow
for
this
type
of
law,
and
if
there
is
one--
mr.
charles
hanemann
--that's
what
speiser
said,
and
that's
what
you
said
in
writing,
in
the
gaudet
decision.
mr.
charles
hanemann
yes,
it's
less
than
all.
but
that--
mr.
charles
hanemann
--they
can
fall
back
on
dohsa,
and
they
might
not
get
them.
if
their
states
do
not
accord
them...
if
their
states
do
not
accord
them
those
kinds
of
damages,
they
do
fall
back
on
dohsa,
and
i
see
dohsa
as
a
guaranteed
minimum
recovery
allowable
by
federal
law
which
operates
even
in
the
event
that
the
states
do
not
allow
some
sort
of
recovery.
mr.
charles
hanemann
i
think
no,
sir,
justice
rehnquiest.
i
don't
think
that's
the
sale
determinant.
there's
a
whole
body
of
laws
which
points
out
what
the
relevant
contacts
are
for
purposes
of
balancing
contacts
in
a
conflicts
of
law
situation.
mr.
charles
hanemann
i
think
that's
correct.
i
think
that
the
forum
state
is
likely
to
apply
its
own...
at
least
in
louisiana
we
would
do
that...
the
forum
state
would
apply
its
conflict
laws
in
order
to
arrive
at
the
choice
of
laws,
yes.
but
i
don't...
once
again,
i
don't
think
that's
going
to
be
as
great
a
practical
problem
as
the
practical
problem
that
results
from
the
petitioner's
petition.
the
petitioner
is
spouting
uniformity,
but
listen
to
how
his
uniformity
works.
picture
the
map
of
louisiana,
shaped
like
a
boot,
the
bottom
of
the
boot
is
the
line
between
the
state
and
the
gulf
of
mexico.
houma
is
down...
houma,
louisiana,
where
these
people
were
heading,
is
down
at
the
bottom
about
20
miles
inland,
and
there's
an
offshore
platform
way
out
there.
picture
four
helicopters
at
the
airport.
the
first
helicopter
takes
off,
crashes
within
minutes
after
it
takes
off.
those
people
get
loss
of
love
and
affection
or
lost
society.
the
next
one
makes
it
out
past
the
coast
but
not
a
marine
league
past
the
coast.
it
crashes.
those
people
get
loss
of
society
under
your
moragne
decision.
the
third
helicopter
gets
all
the
way
out
to
the
platform
and
crashes
on
the
platform.
those
people
get
loss
of
love
and
affection--
mr.
charles
hanemann
--same
statute,
louisiana
article
2315.
but
extended
but
a
different
statute.
mr.
charles
hanemann
precisely.
mr.
charles
hanemann
now--
mr.
charles
hanemann
if
it
blew
up
at
the
platform--
mr.
charles
hanemann
--they
would
get
loss
of
love
and
affection
if
it
crashed
right
there.
mr.
charles
hanemann
i
missed
the
question,
mr.
justice.
mr.
charles
hanemann
i
intended
to,
thank
you.
mr.
charles
hanemann
but
in
all
of
the
situations
except
the
one,
that
is,
between
a
marine
league
offshore
and
the
platform
itself,
by
the
petitioners'
argument,
there
would
be
loss
of
love
and
affection
and
loss
of
society,
and
in
the
middle
there,
the
big
gap
in
the
middle,
there
would
be
no
recovery
for
that,
whereas
by
our
position
you
would
get
either
loss
of
love
and
affection
or
loss
of
society
in
every
one
of
those
locations,
whether
it
crashed
at
home,
whether
it
crashed
in
the
band
less
than
one
marine
league
of
the
coast,
if
it
crashed
on
the
high
seas
between
that
band
and
the
platform,
or
if
it
crashed
on
the
platform.
now,
that
is
uniform--
mr.
charles
hanemann
--pardon
me?
mr.
charles
hanemann
or
500
miles
out.
or
500
miles
out,
yes,
and
i...
i
am
not
ashamed
to
hold
that
position
because
i
think
it
is
philosophically
consistent
with
the
notions
of
federal...
of
application
of
state
law
that
hamilton
espoused
in
the
federal
papers,
that
this
court
espoused
in
the
case
entitled
the
hamilton,
and
with
notions
of
fairness.
i
don't
think...
and
justice
marshall
pointed
this
out
i
think
very
aptly
in
his
dissent
in
the
higginbotham
case.
he
pointed
out,
if
you
will
recall,
that
there
was--
mr.
charles
hanemann
--well,
section...
we
never
had
section
7
on
our
side
in
the
higgibotham
case.
so
i
think
maybe,
maybe
with
section
7
on
our
side,
it
will,
but
the
notion
is
correct.
the
notion
is
that...
and
i
don't
think
anybody
can
argue
with
this...
that
there's
a
certain
basic
unfairness
in
allowing
recovery
to
be
determined...
the
measure
of
recovery
to
be
determined
by
the
mere
fortuity
of
the
geographical
location
when
everything
else
is
the
same.
now
i
want
to
close
with
just
a
brief
parable
which
i
think
portrays
the
unfairness
of
the
petitioners'
position.
let
us
picture
ourself
in
a
land
of
plenty.
there's
a
little
boy
standing
on
the
road
starving.
a
kind
nobleman
comes
along
and
gives
him
a
loaf
of
bread.
he's
happy.
but
right
behind
him
comes
the
king.
the
king
takes
half
the
loaf
of
bread
away
from
him.
the
child
cries
out.
but
the
king
says
don't
cry,
you're
still
better
off
than
you
were
before.
so
the
king
goes
on
a
little
farther
and
he
sees
many
children
with
whole
loaves
of
bread.
so
the
king
has
his
soldiers
go
and
take
the
half
a
loaf
of
bread
away
from
each
of
the
children
with
a
whole
loaf
of
bread,
and
the
people
ask
the
king
why.
and
the
king
says,
because
in
my
land
i
want
uniformity.
so
somebody
points
out
to
the
king
that
when
all
of
the
children
had
whole
loaves
of
bread
there
was
uniformity,
and
the
king
answered,
that's
right,
but
the
only
uniformity
that
i
like
in
my
kingdom
is
the
uniformity
that
comes
from
me.
and
in
a
word,
that
is
the
petitioners'
position.
and
i
don't
think
that
history
is
going
to
be
any
kinder
with
that
position
than
they
have
been
with
southern
pacific
company
v.
jensen.
