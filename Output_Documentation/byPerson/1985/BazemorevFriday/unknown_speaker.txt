ms.
kuhl,
when
this
case
was
tried,
it
was
bench
tried,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
and
did
the
district
court
actually
exclude
statistical
evidence,
or
did
it
just
find
it
unpersuasive?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
is
just
a
question
of
whether
its
finding
then
was
clearly
erroneous,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
think
it
is
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
should
it
be
considered
a
question
of
law?
why
isn't
it
a
question
of
fact
just
because
you
say?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
to
get
by
the
initial
showing
you
have
to
accept
these
statistics.
unknown
speaker
so
that
is
the
question?
was
its
finding
about
the
statistics
clearly
erroneous?
unknown
speaker
well,
now
you
have
answered
the
question
differently
at
least
twice.
is
it
a
question
of
fact
or
not?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
legal
question?
