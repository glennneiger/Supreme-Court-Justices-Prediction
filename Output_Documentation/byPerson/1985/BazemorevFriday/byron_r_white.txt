there
is
still
the
question
of
what
inference
should
be
drawn
from
the
facts.

nevertheless,
nevertheless,
that
is
a
question
of
what
conclusion
may
be
drawn
from
the
facts
that
were
before
the
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
manning,
i
thought
from
reading
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
and
the
district
court
that
these
salary
disparities
the
court
said
could
have
originated
from
one
of
two
sources.
what,
the
quadrant?
what
did
they
call
it?
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--the
quartile.
or,
or
a
hangover
from...
or
a
hangover
from
intential
disparities
before
1955.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
let
me
just
ask
you,
suppose
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
it
was
just
irrelevant
if
these
disparities
were
just
continuations
of
intentional
discrimination
that
occurred
before
1965.
that
is
what
it
said,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
do
you
agree
with...
do
you
think...
the
united
states
says
that
if
after
1965
the
disparities
were
discontinued,
they
just
went
right
on
as
disparities,
they
originated
before
the
act,
but
they
were
continued
afterwards.
they
say
that
that
is
current
intentional
discrimination.
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
agree
with
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
seems
to
me
they
seem
to
say
that
these
disparities
might
in
part
be
attributable
to
that,
but
even
if
it
was,
that
is
just
too
bad.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
judge
find
that
there
never
had
been
any
intentional
discrimination?
or
did
he
say
that
there
was
before
'65?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
the
day
after,
the
day
after
the
act
became
effective
in
1965,
and
these
disparities
continued,
there
was
still
intentional
discrimination,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
day
before
the
act
there
was
intentional
discrimination,
and
the
day
after
there
wasn't?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
sounds
to
me
like
you
are
making
an
argument
there
never
was
intentional
discrimination.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
you--
justice
byron
r.
white
--thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
had
gone
up
from
39
percent.
