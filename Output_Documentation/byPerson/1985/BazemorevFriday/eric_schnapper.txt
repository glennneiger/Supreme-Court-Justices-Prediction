mr.
eric
schnapper
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
address
my
comments
first
to
the
second
issue
in
our
petition,
the
statistical
evidence
problem,
and
i
would
like
to
begin
by
responding
to
the
questions
that
justice
rehnquist
and
justice
white
asked
of
my
colleague
regarding
the
nature
of
the
issue
before
the
court.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
issue
here
is
an
entirely
legal
question.
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
have
somewhat
different
theories,
and
the
legal
issues
that
they
raise
are
therefore
distinct.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
statistical
proof
was
in
its
words
"unacceptable
as
evidence
of
discrimination",
"and
that
was
as
a
matter
of
law,
unless,
and
again
i
quote.
"
all
measurable
variables
thought
to
have
an
effect
"were
included".
in
other
words,
in
a
case
where
there
was
evidence,
as
here,
that
blacks
and
whites
in
the
same
job
were
getting
different
salaries,
and
further
evidence
that
that
couldn't
be
explained
by
differences
in
experience
or
education
of
job
performance.
in
the
court
of
appeals
view,
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
evidence
was
simply
insignificant,
and
the
district
court
could
not
have
made
a
finding
of
discrimination
on
it
even
if
it
had
wanted
to.
on
the
contrary,
on
the
court
of
appeals'
view,
this
case
should
have
been
dismissed--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--as
i
read
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
unless
all
measurable
variables
are
included--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--but
a
rule
of
law
that
a
certain
inference
is
impermissible
is
a
rule
of
law
even
though
it
concerns
the
drawing
of
inference.
it
is
just
like
the
order
of
proof
set
forth
in
mcdonnell-douglas
is
a
rule
of
law.
the
district
court
had
a
somewhat
different
theory.
the
district
court
at
page
133...
excuse
me,
in
its
opinion
made
a
finding
that
the
plaintiffs
had
established
a
prima
facie
case.
our
disagreement
with
the
district
court,
and
i
think
indeed
a
disagreement
between
the
district
court's
opinion
and
those
of
this
court
concerns
how
to
rebut
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination.
on
the
district
court's
view,
a
defendant
can
rebut
proof
of
salary
discrimination
merely
by
offering
evidence
that
additional
factors
go
into
its
salary
determinations
which
were
not
included
in
its
analysis.
the
district
court
clearly
held,
and
i
think
this
is
inconsistent
with
this
court's
previous
decisions,
that
a
defendant
is
under
no
obligation
to
adjure
any
evidence
that
those
factors
in
any
way
correlated
with
race.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
it
is
our
position
that
the
district
court's
view
as
to
what
a
plaintiff
had
to
do
was
wrong
as
a
matter
of
law.
the
district
court's
view
was
that
if
plaintiff
was
required
to
do
more
than
show
that
there
were
differences
in
the
average
salaries
of
blacks
and
whites
even
when
controlled
for
education
and
a
number
of
other
factors,
the
district
court's
view
was
that
we
had
to
control
for
everything,
and
even
for
a
number
of
issues
which
the
district
court
frankly
said
it
was
impossible
to
control.
if
that
is
the
standard,
it
simply
would
be
impossible
to
use
statistical
evidence
under
any
circumstances.
this
isn't
a
case
in
the
district
court
in
which
the
district
court
said,
look,
given
how
much
you
did
do,
and
given
the
evidence
on
the
other
side,
on
balance
i
am
persuaded
that
there
was
no
discrimination.
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
district
court
said
simply
the
fact
that
the
defendant
can
think
up
something
else
that
you
might
have
done
in
your
statistics,
even
though
there
is
no
claim
that
it
would
have
changed
the
result,
that
is
dispositive.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
the
burden
set
out
in
mcdonnell-douglas,
when
a
defendant
comes
forth
and
tries
to
rebut
statistical
evidence,
is
that
it
has
to
offer
evidence
which
it
believed
would
constitute
a
non-racial
explanation.
now,
that
requires,
as
i
read
mcdonnell-douglas,
two
things.
first
of
all--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--well,
we
don't
think
that
what
the
defendant
did
in
this
case
met
the
minimal
standards
that
mcdonnell-douglas
sets.
this
is--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
but
it
is
our
contention
that
there
is
some
minimal
amount
of
evidence
that
has
to
be
reduced
to
rebut
a
prima
facie
case,
and
that
the
minimum
simply
wasn't
met
here.
mr.
eric
schnapper
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
don't
think
one
can
read
this
record
as
one
in
which
the
district
court
saw
evidence
on
the
other
side
and
then
waited
and
made
a
judgment
on
the
merits.
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
district
court
believed
that
the
plaintiff's
burden
was
to
eliminate
every
possible
non-racial
explanation,
and
if
it
didn't
meet
that
burden,
the
plaintiff
should
lose.
i
mean,
the
decision
ought
to
have
been
a
factual
one,
but
that
is
simply
not
what
happened
here.
the
district
court
required
us
to
do
something
which
mcdonnell-douglas
and
all
the
cases
and
decisions
of
this
court
say
we
are
not
obligated
to
do.
i
recognize
that
in
your
concurring
opinion,
as
i
recall,
in
dothard
versus
rawlinson,
you
indicated
a
particular
willingness
to
refer
to
the
district
court's
views
with
regard
to
the
weight
of
statistical
evidence,
and
there
certainly
would
be
cases
in
which
that
was
appropriate,
but
this
is
not
that
kind
of
a
case.
this
isn't
a
situation
in
which
the
district...
in
which
there
was
conflicting
statistical
evidence
and
the
district
court
ruled
in
favor
of
the
defendants.
this
is
a
case
in
which
all
the
statistical
evidence
was
on
one
side,
and
the
district
court
said,
well,
yes,
but
it
could
have
been
better,
and
it
was
very
good,
but
it
wasn't
perfect,
and
if
it
isn't
perfect,
you
lose,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
you
don't
have
to
do
that
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i
think
it
was
close
to
that.
i
mean,
the
case
did
go
to
the
end
of
trial.
it
did
not
stop
in
the
middle.
but
this
is
not
a
situation
in
which
there
was
a
balancing
of
the
evidence.
the
district
court
simply
said
that
the
kind
of
evidence
that
the
plaintiff
had
introduced
simply
was
insufficient
to
meet
its
burden
under
any
circumstances,
because
it
had,
for
example,
because
the
plaintiff
had
failed
to
include
its
analysis.
mr.
eric
schnapper
justice
o'connor,
the
district
court
held
that
statistical
evidence
which
fails
to
include
unmeasurable
variables
is
insufficient
as
a
matter
of
law
to
prove
discrimination.
now,
it
is
impossible
to
include
unmeasurable
variables.
the
district
court
clearly
requires
to
do
something
which
it
acknowledged
was
impossible
to
do.
now,
i
don't
know
that
that
can
be
reasonably
characterized
as
going
to
the
weight
of
the
evidence.
it
simply
set
a
standard
that
was
unmeetable.
i
think
the
manner
in
which
this
issue
arose
throws
considerable
light
on
the
nature
of
the
question.
initially
the
plaintiffs
made
clear
that
they
had
evidence
that
the
average
salaries
of
blacks
and
whites
in
the
same
job
were
different.
the
defendant
undertook
to
meet
what
we
all
understood
to
be
the
defendant's
burden,
that
is,
to
come
forward
with
evidence
which
tended
to
show
that
some
legitimate
non-racial
factor
could
have
explained
it,
and
they
retained
a
statistician,
and
they
said,
look,
we
think
there
are
three
factors
which
would
explain
why
blacks
earn
less
than
whites.
we
think
it
is
job
experience,
we
think
it
is
education,
and
we
think
it
is
sex,
and
they
said,
go
recalculate
the
numbers.
we
believe
it
is
going
to
show
that
when
you
take
those
three
things
into
account
there
is
no
disparity.
well,
the
statistician
did
exactly
the
calculation
that
i
think
dothard
and
hazelwood
and
all
this
court's
cases
require
and
came
back
and
said,
you
are
wrong.
the
evidence
in
fact
is
that
when
you
look
at
these
factors
it
doesn't
eliminate
disparity.
indeed,
in
some
cases
it
increases
the
disparity...
through
the
defendants,
rather
than
attempting
once
again
to
offer
evidence
of
a
factor
that
might
have
explained
away
the
discrimination
of
the
differences
in
salaries.
the
defendants
took
a
completely
different
attack.
they
said,
well,
we
can
think
of
nine
other
factors
that
might
have
explained
this,
but
we
aren't
going
to
show
you
any
evidence
that
in
fact
it
did
explain
it.
we
are,
for
example,
to
focus
on
the
issue
of
particular
importance
to
the
court
of
appeals,
but
also
emphasized
in
the
district
court.
the
defendants
argued,
it
is
possible
that
the
reason
blacks
earn
less
than
whites
is
because
blacks
are
concentrated
in
the
poor
paying
counties
in
the
state,
and
the
district
court
said,
well,
since
that
is
a
possibility,
the
plaintiffs
are
going
to
lose.
defendants
never
introduced
any
evidence
that
blacks
were
in
fact
concentrated
in
the
poorer
counties
in
the
state.
indeed,
the
evidence
is
quite
clearly
to
the
contrary,
but
it
was
the
district
court's
view
and
the
court
of
appeals'
view
that
the
fact
that
some
other
factor
which
never
had
been
dealt
with,
hadn't
been
dealt
with,
hadn't
been
dealt
with,
was
dispositive
in
and
of
itself,
without
regard
to
there
being
any
evidence
or
any
claim
that
that
factor
had
an
explanatory
power.
to
take
a
simpler
example
closer
to
the
original
facts
in
mcdonnell-douglas
against
green,
imagine
a
case
in
which
a
plaintiff
introduced
evidence
according
to
mcdonnell-douglas
that
she
had
applied
for
a
job
as
a
teacher,
that
she
was
qualified,
that
she
had
been
turned
down,
and
that
the
defendants
had
then
gone
on
to
fill
the
job
with
a
man.
that
would
clearly
lead
to
the
plaintiff's
initial
burden
under
mcdonnell-douglas.
what
the
defendants
did
in
this
case
was
to
offer
a
defense
limited
to
the
following
evidence.
we
prefer
people
who
specialize
in
romance
languages,
but
no
evidence
that
the
plaintiff
individual
didn't
in
fact
herself
specialize
in
romance
languages.
as
we
understand
mcdonnell-douglas,
the
minimal
amount
of
evidence
require
to
rebut
a
prima
facie
case
is
not
only
that
there
is
a
racially
neutral
policy,
but
that
the
racially
neutral
policy
had
explanatory
power,
that
it
indeed
could
have
accounted
for
the
disparities.
that
is
precisely
what
the
defendants
very
deliberately
did
not
attempt
to
show
here.
and
at
least
in
a
number
of
these
instances
the
reason
they
didn't
attempt
to
show
it
is
clear,
because
the
evidence
was
quite
the
contrary.
mr.
eric
schnapper
there
is
a
difference
between
our
views
and
that
of
the
solicitor.
it
is
an
important
one,
although
in
a
sense
a
narrow
one.
we
are
of
the
view
suggested
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist
in
his
question
and
in
akins
itself
that
the
court
ought
to
shy
away
from
setting
rigid
mechanical
standards
as
to
just
what
ought
to
be
in
a
prima
facie
case.
the
government
has
offered
a
fairly
elaborate
seven-part
standard
that
has
to
be
met
by
statistics
in
a
discrimination
case.
their
standard
hinges
on
the
distinction
between
major
variables
and
additional
variables,
and
depending
on
whether
a
variable
is
major
or
additional,
the
plaintiff
or
the
defendant
has
to
adduce
the
relevant
evidence,
and
cases
will
be
won
or
lost
depending
on
how
a
court
classifies
the
variable.
we
think
that
the
teaching
of
akins
is
that
the
court
should
not
use
that
sort
of
approach.
we
think
the
various
factors
identified
by
the
government
ought
to
be
considered
by
a
lower
court
or
by
this
court
in
weighing
evidence
of
statistics,
but
that
the
court
should
not
try
to
formulate
a
mechanical
standard
as
to
just
precisely
what
has
to
be
in
a
plaintiff's
prima
facie
case.
we
don't
think
that
the
government
standard
is
particularly
workable.
i
don't
understand
the
difference
between
a
major
variable
and
an
additional
variable.
it
is
clear
that
on
the
government's
theory,
whether
we
win
or
lose
this
case
depends
on
whether
certain
variables
not
in
the
analysis
were
major
or
additional.
skill,
differences
in
skill,
for
example.
the
government,
i
think,
if
i
understand
the
view
correctly,
regards
that
as
merely
an
additional
variable,
not
a
major
variable.
it
is
not
included
in
the
statistical
analysis.
the
argument
for
the
state
is
that
in
the
government's
terms
that
is
a
major
variable.
the
government's
brief
doesn't
explain
how
one
distinguishes
the
two
types
of
variables,
and
we
would
urge
the
court
not
to
adopt
that
kind
of
distinction.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
eric
schnapper
we
are
in
pretty
much
agreement
with
the
government
that
there
really
aren't
factual
findings
with
regard
to
the
4h
club
issue.
i
would
like
to
just
briefly
respond
to
some
factual
questions
the
court
raised
about
this.
first,
with
regard
to
the
size
of
the
state
involvement
in
this
club,
there
was
testimony
at
page
4,956
of
the
transcript
that
the
equivalent
of
122
full-time
state
employees
worked
on
4h
and
extension
homemaker
matters.
secondly,
at
page
5,069,
there
is
testimony
that
the
budget
for
these
activities
totals
approximately
$5
million
on
a
year.
with
regard
to
efforts
to
assure
that
new
4h
club
and
extension
homemaker
clubs
are
integrated,
mr.
manning
said
that
there
was
indeed
such
an
effort.
i
believe
that
is
incorrect.
if
you
look
at
page
1,823
of
the
court
of
appeals
transcript,
you
will
see
an
express
proposal
to
require
that
when
someone
comes
in
with
a
new
club
in
an
integrated
community
and
the
club
is
all
black
or
all
white,
that
the
organizer
be
directed
to
go
out
and
try
to
recruit
members
of
the
other
race.
if
you
look
at
page
1,827,
you
will
note
it
says
deleted
from
the
1974
civil
rights
initiatives.
that
proposal
was
deliberately
and
expressly
rejected
by
the
service,
and
they
have
expressly
decided
not
to
do
exactly
what
the
court
asked
if
they
were
doing.
there
is
indeed,
as
i
think
mr.
justice
blackmun
inquired,
have
been
an
increase
in
the
number
of
single
race
club
in
mixed
communities.
if
you
look
at
pages
103
and
134
of
the
joint
appendix,
you
will
that
the
total
number
of
single
race
clubs
in
integrated
communities
has
indeed
gone
up
from
year
to
year
since
1965.
we
agree
with
the
government
that
the
recruiting--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--the
percentage...
well,
with
regard
to
the
4h
clubs,
the
percentage
has
gone
down
only
because
the
number
of
integrated
clubs
has
gone
up.
the
number
of
segregated
clubs--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--that's
right,
but
the
number
of
single
race
clubs
has
not
changed.
well,
it
has
gone
down
2
percent
in
eight
years.
it
was,
i
think,
890
and
it
is
now
880.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
that
is
right.
i
mean,
we
agree
on
what
the
facts
are.
with
regard
to
the
extension
homemaker
clubs,
there
has
been
no
such
trend,
well,
to
speak
of.
the
latest
data
is
98
percent
of
all
the
extension
homemaker
clubs
in
the
state
are
either
all
black
or
all
white.
there
is
something
less
than
200
blacks
in
the
entire
state
that
belong
to
a
club
that
has
a
white
member
in
it.
now,
i
suppose
technically
that
is
progress.
they
have
made
2
percent
in
a
number
of
years,
and
at
that
rate,
i
suppose,
in
a
very,
very
long
period
of
time
there
might
be
substantial
progress,
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
kind
of
progress
that
mr.
justice
stevens
had
in
mind
when
he
asked
the
question.
mr.
eric
schnapper
in
the
extension
homemaker
clubs,
the
data
is
at
page...
well,
at
page
103
it
says
there
are
only
22
integrated
clubs
of
about
1,800.
later
in
the
record
at
107
it
says
the
number
of
members
of
integrated...
the
number
of
non-white
members
of
integrated
clubs
is
in
the
right-hand
column,
about
the
middle
of
the
page,
is
197.
as
i
said,
the
government
has
suggested
that
we
need
to
have
a
remand
with
regard
to
the
recruiting
problem
because
the
lower
courts
simply
failed
to
address
it.
the
lower
courts
accepted
the
view
that
mr.
manning
has
put
forth
today
that
the
only
obligation
that
the
state
had
in
this
area
was
to
assure
that
if
a
black
actually
found
his
way
or
her
way
to
a
club
and
applied,
that
he
or
she
was
not
rejected.
because
of
that,
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
lower
courts
simply
thought
there
was
no
reason
to
decide
whether
there
was
discrimination
in
recruiting
or
to
decide
whether
there
were
in
fact
continuing
effects
that
date
from
the
original
de
jure
system,
and
there
simply
aren't
findings
on
either
of
those
issues.
we
would
ask
the
court
to
sustain
our
views
that
there
is
such
an
obligation,
and
that
discrimination
in
recruiting
is
illegal,
and
remand
the
case
for
appropriate
relief.
