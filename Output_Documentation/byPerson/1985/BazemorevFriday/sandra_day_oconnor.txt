justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
the
court
in
effect
grant
a
directed
verdict
for
the
defendant?
is
that
your
position,
that
what
the
court
did
was
simply
in
effect
give
a
directed
verdict
or
a
summary
judgment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
they
said
it
was
insufficient.
it
sounds
like
a
weight
of
the
evidence
problem.
that
is
what
makes
it
so
hard
to
understand.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
take
it
you
and
the
solicitor
general
do
not
agree
on
what
factors
have
to
be
brought
in
by
a
plaintiff
to
meet
the
statistical
evidence
burden
that
you
say
exists.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
the
evidence--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--show
us
how
many
of
the
clubs
have
mixed
races
in
them
and
how
many
do
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
where
is
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
178?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
178
tells
us
the
number
of
single
racial
clubs
in
mixed
communities.
does
it
tell
us
the
number
of
mixed
racial
clubs
in
mixed
communities,
or
are
there
any?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it
is
in
the
joint
appendix
some
place?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
as
of...
if
i
am
reading
it
correctly,
as
of
1977
56
percent
of
the
<four
h@l>
[=
4h]
units
in
mixed
communities
were
in
fact
integrated?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
evidence
put
in
about
an
effort
being
made--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--on
the
part
of
the
extension
service
to
attract
integrated
units?
