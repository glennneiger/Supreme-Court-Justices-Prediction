mr.
howard
e.
manning,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
morning
i
feel
like
i
am
watching
my
own
autopsy,
because
as
the
lawyer
who
tried
the
case,
working
14
hours
a
day,
day
and
night,
weekends,
and
being
in
that
courtroom,
i
am
not
hearing
the
same
case
that
we
tried
in
1981
and
1982.
all
we
are
hearing
are
legal
theories
that
are
not
related
to
the
facts
that
the
trial
judge,
frank
dupree,
found
after
hearing
all
of
the
evidence.
there
is
one
thing
about
this
case,
members
of
the
court,
that
we
have
hammered
all
the
way
through,
and
it
is
the
truth,
and
it
is
the
fact.
north
carolina
is
a
state
of
100
counties.
the
extension
service
has
a
branch
in
each
one
of
those
counties.
that
is
indisputed.
it
is
uncontroverted,
and
it
is
in
evidence.
the
facts
in
this
case
dealing
with
salary,
which
the
petitioners
and
the
government
as
so
interested
in,
go
to
the
salaries
of
individual
agents
in
each
county.
the
biggest
fallacy
that
you
will
hear
and
read
in
their
briefs
and
hear
in
rebuttal
is
that
it
is
the
same
job.
it
is
not
the
same
job.
it
is
not
a
similar
job
situation.
the
record
shows,
take,
for
example,
the
record
which
showed
that
an
agent
in
the
mountains
of
north
carolina,
where
there
is
no
golden
leaf
tobacco,
where
there
are
poor
people,
where
they
scratch
a
living
out
in
the
soil,
where
the
county
tax
base
is
poor.
the
evidence
shows
that
that
agent
who
goes
out
and
teaches
the
farmers,
because
that
is
what
an
extension
agent
does,
they
are
teachers,
but
they
teach
to
an
unstructured
group,
when
they
go
out
and
teach
to
the
farmers
in
that
county,
those
people
are
hired
because
they
are
trained
and
educated
in
truck
farming
or
apple
growing
or
something
else.
when
you
go
to
north
carolina's
tobacco
belt
in
the
big
counties
down
there,
they
want
agents
that
are
trained
in
tobacco.
they
want
them
that
are
trained
in
soybeans.
when
you
go
to
charlotte
and
those
areas
of
the
state,
union
county,
where
mr.
bazemore
is
from,
where
they
have
livestock,
they
want
an
agent
like
mr.
bazemore,
who
is
trained
and
knew
about
pig
farming,
and
knew
about
animal
husbandry.
it
is
this
type
of
employment
that
we
are
talking
about
that
requires
special
qualifications.
it
is
not
blue
collar
work.
they
are
college-educated,
and
most
of
them
have
master's
degrees,
and
each
one
of
them
are
hired
in
their
particular
county
based
upon
the
needs
of
that
particular
county
and
their
educational
background.
it
is
just
like
hiring
a
tax
specialist
to
come
to
work
in
a
law
firm,
or
a
litigation
specialist.
it
depends
on
what
the
needs
of
each
of
the
100
counties
are.
now,
we
are
not
going
to...
one
other
thing
i
would
say,
that
much,
that
is
the
facts.
if
you
look
at
the
facts,
you
will
see
that
the
jobs
are
not
similar,
and
once
you
understand
that
principle,
their
arguments
are
bouncing
off
the
beautiful
walls
in
here,
because
judge
dupree
and
we
knew
it,
and
we
told
him
that
those
are
what
the
facts
are,
and
they
just
have
disregarded
it.
they
disregarded
it
this
morning
in
their
argument.
they
disregarded
it
in
their
briefs,
because
we
are
not
dealing
with
similar
jobs.
the
way
their
statistical
case
and
their
case
fell
apart
is
that
they
didn't
take
this
into
account.
they
came
in
and
judge
dupree
let
in
all
one
evidence.
he
didn't
keep
anything
out.
all
the
statistical
regressions,
all
of
these
averages
that
everybody
put
in
comparing
black
and
white,
all
of
this
came
in.
but
they
didn't
take
into
account
that
you
can't
compare
the
agent
in
ash
county,
north
carolina,
a
poor
county
in
north
carolina
who
is
doing
apples,
and
who
is
teaching
people
in
appalachia
how
to
truck
farm
more
effectively,
you
can't
compare
his
job
or
the
economic
conditions
in
which
he
is
paid
with
that
of
the
chief
tobacco
agent
in
wilson
county,
north
carolina,
where
the
tobacco
crop
brings
in
millions
of
dollars
a
year.
mr.
howard
e.
manning,
jr.
quartile.
mr.
howard
e.
manning,
jr.
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
said.
mr.
howard
e.
manning,
jr.
the
court
of
appeals
went
on.
mr.
howard
e.
manning,
jr.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
they
could
not...
that
was
not
a
present
violation.
mr.
howard
e.
manning,
jr.
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
howard
e.
manning,
jr.
in
theory,
justice
white,
we
would
have
to
agree
with
that,
but
that--
mr.
howard
e.
manning,
jr.
--no,
they
did
not
agree
with
that.
mr.
howard
e.
manning,
jr.
well,
let
me
address
the
facts
in
answer
to
your
question,
because
i
am
glad
you
asked
it.
the
court
of
appeals
decision...
let's
go
back
to
the
district
court.
mr.
howard
e.
manning,
jr.
i
prepared
and
we
prepared
in
our
brief,
taking
just
the
point
that
you
mentioned,
the
question
goes
back
to
the
facts.
they
see
it,
and
this
is
a
good
time
for
me
to
discuss
what
the
salaries
are
composed
of,
because
this
will
answer
a
lot
of
questions
if
you
think
about
it.
the
salaries
of
any
agent
come
from
four
sources.
the
first
is
state
and
federal
funding.
the
second
is
the
county
salary
portion,
which
makes
the
whole.
the
only
way
that
a
salary...
then
there
is
the
merit
salary
increase,
whether
it
comes
from
the
state
or
federal
on
odd
years
or
whenever
it
comes,
or
the
county
merit
increase.
those
are
the
three...
four
sources
of
funding
from
the
time
you
start.
each
one
of
those
was
found
by
the
district
court
and
again
by
the
fourth
circuit,
those
sources,
to
be
either
uniformly
applied,
no
discrimination
at
all,
never
has
been
any
in
this
application,
and
the
performance
system
which
determined
the
merit
pay
was
found
to
be
nondiscriminatory.
now
i
am
going
back,
all
right,
to
pre-'65.
we
prepared
this
chart.
if
what
the
petitioners
say
is
true,
i.e.,
that
we
were
paying
all
of
the
blacks
less
money
before
1955
deliberately,
which
we
contend
was
not
the
case,
there
were
average
differences
between
black
and
white
salaries.
if
that
were
the
case,
if
that
were
the
case,
you
would
not
have
the
result
seven
years
later
that
is
shown
here.
that
is
just
not
what
the
evidence
showed,
and
judge
dupree
saw
that
evidence.
he
didn't
find
that--
mr.
howard
e.
manning,
jr.
--he
found
that
before
'65
there
was
a
de
jure,
a
segregated
system,
and
we
can't--
mr.
howard
e.
manning,
jr.
--that
is
the
way
it
was.
yes,
sir.
but
after
that--
mr.
howard
e.
manning,
jr.
--i
disagree,
because
what
you--
mr.
howard
e.
manning,
jr.
--well,
i
disagree.
the
salaries,
you
have
to...
you
are
getting
back
and
taking
me
away
from
the
fact
that
these
people,
whether
they
were
there
before
'65
or
after
'65,
were
not
doing
the
same
jobs.
in
other
words,
when
they
came
into
effect
in
<nineteen
sixty-five>
[=
1965],
they
were
not...
the
service
knew
there
were
disparities,
and
worked
at
doing
that,
but
everybody
had
disparities.
if
you
will
look
at
the
evidence--
mr.
howard
e.
manning,
jr.
--i
am
not
making
that
argument
that
there
wasn't,
because--
mr.
howard
e.
manning,
jr.
--before
'65
it
was
a
two-way
system.
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
e.
manning,
jr.
but
the
next
point
that
i
would
make
in
connection
with
that
and
in
answer
to
that
as
to
whether
that
continued
in
salaries
or
not
is
to
look
at
the
chart
which
we
attached
to
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
if
that
theory
was
true,
and
it
continued,
and
we
say
it
did
not,
then
there
would
be
a
market,
and
this
is
appendix
exhibit
a,
there
would
be...
the
pre-'65
blacks
and
the
pre-'65
whites
would
be
spread
like
this.
if
you
will
take
a
look
at
that
chart,
which
is
everybody
who
was
there
in
1965
and
there
in
'72,
you
will
find
all
over
the
board,
from
the
bottom
to
the
top,
whites
and
blacks
are
dispersed.
there
were
42
black
agents
who
were
there
and
there
were
65
white
agents
there,
and
if
you
will
take
a
look
at
it,
you
will
see.
the
point
i
am
making
is
that
from
1965,
when
the
law
took
effect,
the
extension
service,
and
both
courts
so
found,
operated
on
a
non-discriminatory
basis,
and
that
is
what
judge
dupree
found
as
a
matter
of
fact.
he
did
not
find
a
prima
facie
case
on
the
evidence
that
came
in.
judge
dupree
said
that
a
careful
weighing
and
assessment
of
the
plaintiff's
statistical
and
non-statistical
evidence
led
the
court
to
conclude
that
the
plaintiffs
had
probably
made
out
a
prima
facie
case
with
respect
to
defendants'
promotion
and
salary
practice,
and
the
analysis
of
the
court
proceeded
on
this
assumption.
while
not
conceding
that
the
plaintiffs
have
made
a
prima
facie
case,
the
defendant
extension
service
assumed
the
burden,
which
we
did,
of
articulating
plausible
reasons
for
its
action,
and
its
evidence,
which
the
court,
the
trial
court
found
convincing,
has
been
set
forth
therein.
the
plaintiffs
failed
to
adduce
evidence
that
our
reasons,
defendants'
reasons
were
protectual,
and
their
case
failed.
that
is
what
happened
here.
mr.
howard
e.
manning,
jr.
i
didn't
write
the
opinion.
i
wouldn't
have
written
it
that
way.
i
don't
know
why
they
said
it,
but
i
can
give
you
my
best
explanation.
they
were
doing
the
same
analysis
on
where
the
money
comes
from.
if
you
will
read
that
portion
of
their
opinion,
what
they
were
saying
was
this.
there
can
be
no
discrimination
in
across-the-board
wages
that
the
state
gives.
there
was
none.
there
was
none
in
the
county
across-the-board
wages,
which
is
the
way
most
employees
in
government
service
get
paid.
the
only
two
places
that
there
could
have
possibly
been
any
discrimination,
and
what
they
were
saying
in
i.e.,
what
justice
white
had
said,
a
lingering
effect
of
what
was
there,
salaries
of
pre-'65
hires
who
were
there
in
'72,
and
then
they
said
the
other
one
is
the
performance
or
the
merit
pay
system,
which
is
the
quartile
system,
which
we
use
because
our
employees
don't
do
the
same
jobs,
and
they
said
it
in
that
context.
they
then
said
that
they
did
not
feel
that
under
evans
or
under
hazelwood,
that
under
those
conditions,
that
those,
if
there
were
lingering
effects,
that
they
were
presently
actionable.
i
personally
would
agree
with
that
assessment.
i
don't
know
how
the
court
is
going
to
agree
with
it.
i
would
say
seven
years
later
that
that
is
how
they...
that
is
the
context
in
which
they
discussed
it,
which
leads
into
our
point
that
we
have
tried
to
make
and
judge
dupree
saw.
the
manner
in
which
our
agents
are
paid
comes
from
a
system
which...
and
not
appeal,
and
not
before
this
court,
which
is
found
to
be
in
all
facets,
in
hiring,
in
promotion,
in
in-house
education,
to
be
non-discriminatory.
the
extension
service,
members
of
the
court,
if
you
read
in
this
entire
opinion,
and
what
they
didn't
appeal
from
was
found
to
be
non-discriminatory
completely
in
its
employment
practices
and
when
you
look
at
the...
going
to
the
variable
question
that
mr.
schnapper
was
talking
about
a
minute
ago,
that
these
were
imaginary
things
that
judge
dupree
rejected,
what
i
have
just
told
you
is
hardly
imaginary.
it
is
in
evidence,
and
it
is
the
fact.
those
were
not
included
in
their
statistical
case,
nor
did
they
ever
take
them
into
account.
the
other
thing
that
i
think
which
shows
the
court
immediately
that
what
we
are
saying
about
our
services,
it
is
not
uniform
from
county
to
county,
is
the
extension
chairmen's
salaries,
all
of
whom
are
the
head
person
in
the
county,
and
that
is
found
in
the
joint
appendix
on
page
165
for
three
years.
the
range
in
salaries
of
the
top
person
in
that
county
is
between
$2,000
and
$5,000
a
year,
and
everybody
under
him
or
her
is
going
to
be...
is
not
going
to
be
paid
any
more
regardless
of
what
kind
of
job
they
do
or
regardless
of
their
specialty,
and
this
is
the
point.
north
carolina's
situation
is
not
a
factory
setting,
like
a
wiget
factory,
nor
is
it
everybody
examining
tax
forms.
the
other
thing
that
is
different,
that
is
a
major
factor
that
judge
dupree
pointed
out
in
balancing
the
regression
and
not
swallowing
all
of
these
comparisons
that
everybody
put
forth
to
him,
were
that
the
county
salaries,
percentage
of
state
and
county,
varied
with
each
county.
for
example,
if
justice
white
and
i
started
out
at
the
same
time
out
of
law
school
or
out
of
the
agent
school
with
the
same
degree,
and
we
both
got
a
salary
of
$10,000
a
year
to
start,
and
he
went
into
a
county
that
had
a
70
percent
county...
state
supplement
of
his
salary,
and
mine
was
40,
and
that
example
is
in
our
brief,
at
the
end
of
the
first
year,
if
he
got
a
5
percent
state
raise,
he
would
have
gotten
a
$350
raise,
i
would
have
gotten
a
$200
raise,
and
that
happens
every
year
in
100
counties,
and
affects
all
employees.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
race.
that
is
what
judge
dupree
and
the
trial
court
saw.
now,
moving
to
the
question
which
is
one
of
the
issues
raised
this
morning,
is
that
the
county
extension
chairmanships,
and
this
goes
to
the
head
person
in
the
county,
and
i
just
briefly
would
say,
because
it
hasn't
been
argued,
but
i
want
to
make
the
point
that
both
courts
were
correct
there.
there
were
23
individual
cases
on
that
issue,
five
futility
applicants
and
18
actual
black
plaintiffs
who
were
present
in
court,
whose
cases
were
put
on
very
ably
by
mr.
reblin,
who
is
here
this
morning,
put
on
very
ably,
and
we
answered
every
charge,
and
judge
dupree
in
his
opinion
on
the
individual
claims
found
that
we
had
offered
a
legitimate
nondiscriminatory
reason
for
each
and
every
single
case.
that
is
a
factual
case.
he
decided
it
on
the
facts.
it
was
not
found
to
be
erroneous
by
the
court
of
appeals,
and
these
arguments
about
general
telephone
and
these
other
cases,
they
shouldn't
be
here,
because
that
case
was
decided
on
the
facts,
and
nobody
has
said
that
judge
dupree
is
clearly
erroneous.
with
respect
to
the
club
issue,
there
is
one,
members
of
the
court,
that
is
astounding
to
hear
what
i
have
heard
this
morning.
the
extension
service,
as
justice
white
pointed
out,
was
in
fact
segregated
prior
to
1965.
at
the
end
of
1965,
and
when
it
came
into
effect,
they
set
about
to
integrate
that
service
and
its
programs.
the
4h
clubs
and
the
homemaker
extension
clubs
are
viable,
educational,
voluntary
groups
run
by
volunteers
and
assisted
by
extension
workers
in
every
single
county.
mr.
schnapper's
brief
asserts
that
there
was
intentional
discrimination
in
recruitment,
and
the
government
pointed
out
in
their
brief
there
is
no
evidence
of
that.
we
tried
this
case
for
ten
weeks.
if
you
look
at
the
fact
that
extension
programs
like
this
are
not
static,
and
the
membership
changes
all
the
time,
we
have
run
through
100,000
kids
a
year
and
volunteers
in
that
program
since
1965.
among
those,
40,000
or
whatever
the
numbers
show
are
black,
black
male
and
female
volunteers
that
come
to
those
clubs,
who
organize
those
clubs,
and
black
children
and
white
children,
and
if
you
look
at
our
figures,
we
integrated.
the
one
thing
that
the
plaintiffs
never
brought
forward
out
of
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
participants
in
north
carolina,
male,
female,
and
those
who
were
children
in
'65
who
are
adults
now,
was
that
there
was
any
evidence
that
they
were
ever
rejected
from
membership
in
a
club,
that
they
ever
felt
the
least
discrimination
in
engaging
in
programs.
mr.
howard
e.
manning,
jr.
the
record
does
show
that.
mr.
howard
e.
manning,
jr.
my
comment
on
that
is
that
they
are
formed
in
racially
mixed
communities,
one
race
in
north
carolina.
they
are
static,
and
they
are
reborn,
and
they
are
formed
that
way.
they
are
formed
that
way
in
the
other
states
in
the
country,
and
the
record
shows
that.
the
point
that
i
would
make
to
your
honor
is
this.
those
people
who
are
organizing
those
clubs,
the
black
volunteers
or
the
white
volunteers,
do
not
deny
membership
nor
do
they
discriminate
in
membership
nor
do
they
exclude
anyone.
anyone
is
available
to
join,
and
i
think.
mr.
howard
e.
manning,
jr.
yes,
that
is
what
the
policy
of
the
extension
service
is.
that
is
what
the
volunteers
who
are
trained
by
the
extension
service
are
told
to
do.
mr.
howard
e.
manning,
jr.
well,
there
is
an
effect.
the
effect
is,
as
you
can
see
by,
and
i
will
turn
to
the
page,
to
the
exhibits
on
pages
joint
appendix
160
through
219...
i
mean,
on
page
173
and
on
page
174,
the
effect
of
this
is,
and
i
think
i
need
to
point
this
out,
the
community
clubs
that
the
plaintiffs,
the
petitioners
are
complaining
about
make
up
the
smallest
segment
of
the
4h
program.
above
that,
if
you
will
take
a
look
at
the
record
in
this
case,
and
membership,
you
will
point
out
that
black
membership
and
white
membership
in
all
of
the
clubs,
including
those,
has
grown.
mr.
howard
e.
manning,
jr.
has
grown,
has
gotten,
instead
of...
in
other
words,
i
am
arguing
negative
evidence.
there
is
no
evidence
at
all
that
anyone
was
excluded,
and
yet
the
program,
the
positive
evidence
is
that
this
program
has
continued
to
grow
in
enrollment,
in
black
and
white
volunteers.
the
camps
are
integrated.
mr.
howard
e.
manning,
jr.
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
howard
e.
manning,
jr.
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
manning,
jr.
page
178.
mr.
howard
e.
manning,
jr.
of
the
joint
appendix.
there
are
several
exhibits.
mr.
howard
e.
manning,
jr.
there
are,
and
i
cannot
in
the
joint
appendix...
it
is
in
the
record.
there
are--
mr.
howard
e.
manning,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
there
are
and
have
been
a
growth.
it
is
in
the
record,
and
i
cannot
put
my
hand
on
that,
on
the
joint
appendix,
but
there
are
mixed
race
clubs,
both
racial
clubs
in
mixed
communities,
and
i
do
not
have--
mr.
howard
e.
manning,
jr.
--it
is
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
134.
right
here.
on
page
134.
it
gives
the
enrollments
at
least
through
'77
showing
the
number
of
4h
units
integrated
in
mixed
communities,
and
that
is
the
second
column
down.
i
would
point
out--
mr.
howard
e.
manning,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
howard
e.
manning,
jr.
yes.
i
would
point
out
this
additional
point,
that
above
the
focus
has
been
microcosmed
by
the
petitioners
in
this
case
on
just
this,
but
the
community
clubs
are
a
small
segment.
in
addition
to
the
community
clubs
are
what
are
known
as
special
interest
groups,
which
are
formed,
for
example,
to
do
model
airplanes
or
to
do
something,
and
they
are
integrated
in
this,
but
what
i
would
say
is,
there
is
just
no
evidence.
they
put
on
no
evidence
and
there
is
no
evidence
that
anybody
came
forward
and
said
we
feel
that
we
have
been
discriminated
against.
we
didn't
join
because
we
didn't
want
to.
there
is
no
evidence
of
that
at
all.
mr.
howard
e.
manning,
jr.
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
manning,
jr.
the
effort...
there
is
a
lot
of
evidence
that
is
put
in
on
that
issue,
and
it
is
hotly...
that
was,
to
be
frank
with
you,
it
was
a
hotly...
how
we
accomplished
it,
and
what
the
plaintiffs
wanted
us
to
do
was
the
thrust
of
this.
there
was
a
guideline
called
all
reasonable
efforts,
and
i
won't
duck
this
one,
which
was
not
a...
it
was
not
a
regulation,
but
it
was
a
printed
guideline
which
they
wanted
to
go
out
and
say,
you
had
to
knock
on
every
door
in
every
neighborhood
to
recruit
individuals.
the
service
did
not
do
that.
the
service
encouraged
it,
and
i
think
it
is
the
growth
in
the
program
and
the
absence
of
anybody
coming
forward
and
saying
they
in
any
way
felt
discriminated
against,
didn't
join
for
any
reason,
we
feel
that
we
did
all
reasonable
efforts
short
of
doing
that
which
was
a
suggestion
that--
mr.
howard
e.
manning,
jr.
--justice
powell,
the
relationship
is
that
the
4h
clubs
are
voluntary
organizations
that
have
an
extension
service
agent
who
is
a
4h
agent,
who
would
furnish
them
materials,
who
will
train
their
volunteer
leaders,
who
will
give
them
pamphlets
and
programs
on
how
to
do
something,
and
then
the
volunteer
and
the
boys
and
girls
in
the
program
will
take
the
ball
and
run
with
it.
mr.
howard
e.
manning,
jr.
the
state
finances
the
4h
agents.
mr.
howard
e.
manning,
jr.
but
it
is
my
understanding
they
don't
finance
the
clubs
other
than
they
would
get
materials.
most
of
the
funds
come
from
volunteer
time
and
volunteer
contributions,
although
obviously
your
pamphlets
on
how
to
grow
corn
or
do
this
model
would--
mr.
howard
e.
manning,
jr.
--yes,
they
are,
and
they
always
have
been.
mr.
howard
e.
manning,
jr.
yes,
they
are
organized
by
volunteers
who
want
to
help
the
children
and
who
are
trained
by
the
extension
service
workers
in
how
to
effectuate
the
program.
mr.
howard
e.
manning,
jr.
no,
sir.
and
the
reason--
mr.
howard
e.
manning,
jr.
--well,
there
are
not
enough
extension
workers...
well,
my
answer
to
the
question
is
this
way,
justice
marshall.
there
are
not
enough
extension
workers
to
deal
with
<forty
thousand>
[=
40,000]
children.
mr.
howard
e.
manning,
jr.
those
that
are
in
a
county
which
is
big
enough
to
afford
a
full-time
4h
agent.
in
many
counties,
the
person
has
4h
responsibilities
who
also
has
corn
or
soybeans
or
something
else.
in
other
words,
it
is
not
a
full-time
position
unless
the
county
has
enough
money
to
afford
that
particular
type
of
agent,
and
they
are...
they
go
out
and
they
will
assist
the
volunteers
in
organizing
but
not
go
out
and
organize
them
themselves.
no,
sir,
they
don't
have
the
resources
to
do
that.
there
are
not
enough
of
them.
mr.
howard
e.
manning,
jr.
i
would
say
now
the
big
ones
probably
at
least
80
of
the
100
counties
would
have
the
full-time,
and
i
am
not
speaking
from
any
real
knowledge,
just
from
knowledge
of
the
case.
mr.
howard
e.
manning,
jr.
it
is
not...
the
4h
program
is
under
the
auspices
of
the
extension
service,
but
it
is
a
voluntary
program
which
is
not
regulated.
mr.
howard
e.
manning,
jr.
it
is
not
like
the
white
primary
at
all.
mr.
howard
e.
manning,
jr.
no.
mr.
howard
e.
manning,
jr.
all
volunteer.
mr.
howard
e.
manning,
jr.
no,
the
agent
is
provided
by
the
state,
and
he
trains
the
volunteers,
or
would
come
in
and
give
a
program
to
the
club,
but
he
doesn't
run
the
clubs.
mr.
howard
e.
manning,
jr.
there
is
no
compulsion
to
join
at
all.
mr.
howard
e.
manning,
jr.
you
could
leave
the
next
day.
and
these
clubs
are
not
fixed
in
stone.
that
is
all
the
time
i
have.
