is
there
some
great
legal
principle
controlling
statistical
evidence
that
doesn't
control
other
kinds
of
evidence?
i
mean,
presumably
there
is
some
good
statistical
evidence,
some
that
is
moderately
persuasive,
and
some
perhaps
that
is
so
bad
it
shouldn't
be
persuasive
at
all.
why
treat
statistics
differently
than
other
kinds
of
evidence?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
schnapper,
why
isn't
this
case
really
more
to
be
judged
in
the
light
of
akins
versus
postal
service,
rather
than
mcdonnell-douglas,
since
all
the
proof
was
in?
i
mean,
the
district
court
was
simply
making
findings
as
to
whether
the
plaintiffs
had
carried
their
ultimate
burden
of
proof
of
showing
discrimination.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
his
finding
on
that
score
may
have
been
clearly
erroneous.
perhaps
the
evidence
is
so
clear
that
although
there
may
be
some
evidence
to
support
it,
that
an
appellate
court
is
convinced
a
mistake
has
been
made,
but
i
don't
see
why
that
turns
the
whole
question
of
use
of
statistics
into
inevitably
a
question
of
law.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
ask
you
again,
mr.
schnapper.
since
all
of
this
material
did
go
to
the
finder
of
fact,
and
he
ultimately
resolved
the
case,
think
mcdonnell-douglas
deals
with
what
you
do
to
get
through
finally
to
having
the
finder
of
fact
decide
it.
once
you
get
to
the
finder
of
fact,
it
is
simply
a
question
of
who
has
carried
the
ultimate
burden
of
persuasion,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
ultimate
issue
is
whether
or
not
there
was
discrimination,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
are
not
talking
about
prima
facie
cases
any
more
when
you
go
to
the
finder
of
fact
and
the
finder
of
fact
makes
a
determination.
you
are
talking
about,
did
the
plaintiff
carry
the
burden
of
proof
on
this
issue.
maybe
the
district
court
was
wrong,
but
that
is
simply
a
question
of
being
clearly
erroneous.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
district
court...
did
the
court
of
appeals
accept
this
finding
of
the
district
court?
if
it
did,
why
did
it
go
on
to
say
that
it
was
permissible
as
a
post-act
consequence
of
a
pre-act
situation?
