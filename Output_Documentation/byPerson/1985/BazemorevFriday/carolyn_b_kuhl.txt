ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
address
in
my
argument
this
morning
three
of
the
issues
raised
in
this
case,
but
first
i
would
like
to
articulate
briefly
our
position
with
respect
to
each.
the
first
issue
concerns
the
intentionally
discriminatory
pay
disparity
between
black
and
white
agricultural
service
agents
which
originated
pre-title
7
and
continued
after
the
effective
date
of
title
7.
both
courts
below
agreed
on
the
existence
of
these
disparities,
but
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
because
the
difference
in
pay
originated
before
title
7,
the
current
pay
practice
was
not
actionable.
it
is
our
position
that
a
current
practice
of
intentionally
paying
blacks
less
than
whites
on
the
basis
of
race
cannot
be
immunized
by
the
fact
that
the
practice
began
before
title
7's
effective
date.
the
second
issue
concerns
use
of
the
statistics
in
title
7
disparate
treatment
cases.
the
issue
framed
by
the
private
petitioners
is
whether
a
statistical
analysis
must
take
into
account
every
conceivable
nonracial
variable
before
the
statistics
may
be
considered
probative.
we
do
not
believe
that
a
plaintiff's
statistical
proof
must
account
for
every
conceivable
factor
that
might
bear
on
salary.
indeed,
a
statistician
would
tell
us
that
that
is
not
possible,
but
we
do
take
the
position
that
the
plaintiff
here
has
met
the
burden
of
proof
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
in
proving
discrimination
on
the
statistics
presented
in
this
case.
in
contrast
to
petitioners,
however,
we
argue
that
in
order
to
raise
an
inference
of
intentional
discrimination,
it
is
necessary
for
the
statistical
analysis
to
eliminate
the
most
common
nondiscriminatory
reason
for
the
disparate
treatment,
leaving
racial
discrimination
as
a
logical
inference,
and
we
also
believe
that
the
plaintiffs
must
offer
statistics
raising
that
inference
as
part
of
his
prima
facie
case
in
accordance
with
the
order
of
proof
set
forth
in
mcdonnell-douglas.
finally,
the
third
issue
concerns
disestablishment
of
the
pre-act
segregated
system
of
operating
4h
and
extension
homemaker
clubs.
private
petitioners
now
seem
to
be
arguing
that
the
courts
below
erred
in
not
addressing
whether
there
was
current
discrimination
in
recruitment
for
membership
in
the
clubs.
this
is
essentially
a
fact-found
question,
and
although
we
believe
that
recruitment
was
addressed
by
the
courts
below,
we
would
have
no
objection
to
a
remand
on
that
liability
issue.
however,
in
their
petition,
the
private
petitioners
seem
to
state
a
different
legal
issue,
that
is
whether
as
a
matter
of
law
respondent
should
be
held
to
have
failed
to
disestablish
a
formerly
segregated
system
when
some
all
white
and
some
all
black
clubs
continue
to
exist.
on
this
legal
issue,
we
believe
that
the
court
below
was
clearly
correct.
a
state
that
has
ensured
that
all
of
its
practices
relating
to
admissions
are
truly
race
neutral
need
not
eliminate
an
open
admission
membership
system
that
would
otherwise
be
the
norm
in
order
to
assure
a
particular
racial
mix.
to
return
then
in
somewhat
more
detail
to
the
first
issue,
the
continuing
race-based
salary
disparity,
it
is
important
to
note
that
pre-1965
the
entire
agricultural
extension
service
was
operated
on
a
de
jure
segregated
basis.
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
agents
working
in
this
system
were
paid
different
depending
on
whether
they
worked
in
the
black
branch
or
in
the
white
branch.
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
also
found
that
this
pay
disparity
was
intentionally
continued
by
the
service
and
persisted
after
1972,
when
title
7
became
applicable
to
the
states.
the
error
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
in
excusing
this
post-act
discrimination
on
the
basis
that
it
originated
in
the
pre
1965
de
jure
period,
but
the
court
of
appeals
analysis,
we
think,
misreads
this
court's
decisions
in
evans
and
in
hazelwood,
and
misconstrues
the
nature
of
the
violation
proof.
the
wrong
alleged
here
is
not
that
the
service
failed
to
correct
the
effects
of
pre-act
discrimination.
the
wrong
here
is
rather
a
current
post-act
practice
of
paying
blacks
less
than
whites.
as
was
stated
in
evans,
the
question
is
really
whether
a
present
violation
exists.
an
employer
is
entitled
to
treat
pre-act
discriminatory
practices
as
to
which
the
time...
either
pre-act
practice
or
practice
as
to
which
the
time
has
run,
as
if
it
was
totally
legal.
thus,
in
evans
the
firing
of
the
stewardess
was
merely
considered
an
unfortunate
event
in
history,
but
there
we
have
something
entirely
different
from
a
pre-act
promotion
or
hiring
decision
or
firing
decision.
what
we
have
here
is
a
present
violation
of
the
sort
that
was
lacking
in
evans.
the
violation
here
rests
solely...
does
not
rest
solely
on
pre-act
conduct.
rather,
there
is
a
purposeful
post-act
practice
of
paying
blacks
less
than
whites.
on
the
second
issue
of
the
statistical
proof
of
discrimination
in
the
agent's
salaries,
we
have
shown
in
our
brief
that
the
statistics
offered
in
this
case
were
sufficient
to
meet
the
plaintiff's
burden
of
showing
purposeful
discrimination.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
i
believe
that's
correct.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
the
district
court
allowed
in
the
statistical
evidence,
but
it
seriously
misunderstood
and
misanalyzed
what
was
in
the
statistical
evidence.
for
example,
the
court,
the
district
court
said
there
was
no
statistical
evidence
with
regard
to
performance
of
the
agents.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
i
believe
that
is
right,
although
we...
i
think
it
is
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law,
and
we
think
that--
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
--well,
because
i
think
that
the
use,
the
appropriate
use
of
statistics
is...
and
whether
the
burdens
have
been
met
and
the
allocation
of
the
burdens
is
really
a
question
of
fact
in
the
district,
but
if
it
is
considered
a
question
of
law,
our
view
is
that
the
court
below--
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
--well,
i
think
that
it
is,
and
particularly
in
this
case,
where
the
district
court
seemed
to
misunderstand
the
use
of
statistical
evidence,
and
the
court
of
appeals
also
seemed
to
misunderstand
the
use
of
statistical
evidence.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
well,
indeed,
that
is
our
submission,
that
statistics
should
be
treated
the
same
as
the
order
of
proof
in
a
mcdonnell-douglas
type
of
situation.
we
think
that
the
private
petitioners'
criticism
of
the
test
that
we
suggest,
placing
a
burden,
a
prima
facie
burden
on
the
plaintiffs
to
create
an
inference
of
intentional
discrimination,
we
think
that
the
private
petitioners
misperceive
what
we
are
really
asking
here.
we
are
asking
no
more,
and
it
is
no
more
complicated
than
what
happens
in
the
mcdonnell-douglas
type
of
situation
where
the
plaintiff
has
to
show
that
he
met
the
qualifications
of
the
job
and
the
defendant
may
then
go
back
and
say,
yes,
but
someone
else
was
more
qualified.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
your
question,
justice
white.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
well,
i
think
that
we
meet
that
burden
here.
i
think
that
we
meet
that
burden
here.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
well,
it
would
still
be
my
view
that
it
is
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law
in
this
case,
that
we
do
meet
the--
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
--i
think
it
is
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law,
but
i
think
we
also
meet
the
clearly
erroneous--
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
--i
think
the
legal
question
is
the
appropriate
allocation
of
the
burden
of
proof
here,
but
we
have
briefed
the
case
also
as
though
it
could
be
considered
a
question
of
fact.
with
respect
to
the
desegregation
of
the
4h
and
extension
homemaker
clubs,
the
main
point
that
we
wish
to
make
is
this.
this
court
has
never
held
that
the
traditional
free
choice
of
non-state
actors
must
be
eliminated
before
a
system
can
be
found
to
be
desegregated.
even
in
green
versus
the
school
board
in
the
school
desegregation
context,
the
court
explicitly
left
open
the
prospect
that
a
free
choice
plan
might
sometimes
be
appropriate.
the
court
held
that
the
free
choice
plan
in
the
context
of
that
case
was,
however,
a
contrived
way
of
doing
business
with
no
legitimate
rationale.
in
contrast
here
the
norm,
the
normal
way
of
operating
these
4h
clubs
is
by
an
open
membership
system.
it
is
further
important
to
understand
here
that
the
district
court
has
found
no
discrimination
in
services
or
membership
with
respect
to
the
clubs
as
of
the
time
of
trial.
indeed,
the
court
expressly
found
that
any
racial
imbalance
existing
among
clubs
was
the
product
of
exclusively
and
wholly
voluntary
choice
of
private
individuals,
that
is,
of
non-state
actors.
the
private
petitioners
argue
that
freedom
of
choice
with
respect
to
club
membership
has
not
been
the
norm
in
the
4e
system
because
whites
were
required
to
attend
white
clubs
and
blacks
were
required
to
attend
black
clubs,
but
that
misperceives
how
one
determines
what
the
norm
would
have
been.
in
any
de
jure
segregated
system
there
is
assignment
on
the
basis
of
race
during
the
de
jure
period,
but
the
issue
is,
what
happens
with
respect
to,
say,
whites
among
whites
and
blacks
among
blacks.
thus,
in
a
situation
with
respect
to,
say,
parks
or
seats
on
a
bus
or
indeed
colleges,
the
norm
is
a
free
choice
admission
program,
and
in
those
situations
we
believe
that
disestablishment
certainly
can
be
found
even
though
free
choice
has
been
preserved.
i
have
nothing
further
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions.
