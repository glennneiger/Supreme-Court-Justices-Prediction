justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
appel,
i
take
it
you
take
the
position
that
under
these
circumstances
the
attorney
had
a
duty
to
challenge
his
client's
proposed
false
testimony?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
standard
do
you
think
should
be
employed
to
determine
when
the
facts
are
sufficient
to
impose
such
a
professional
obligation
on
the
lawyer?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
the
lawyer
have
to
be
convinced
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
or
just
have
a
mere
suspicion,
or
what?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
standard,
then?
what
level
of
certainty
must
a
lawyer
have
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
guess
i
didn't
hear
if
you
answered
my
question.
would
it
be
a
different
case
if
the
defendant
had
not
taken
the
stand
at
all?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
a
separate
right
of
the
defendant
to
be
heard,
do
you
think?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
involved
here
at
all,
as
opposed
to
any
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
grady,
how
did
the
action
of
the
lawyer
here,
whether
or
not
it
met
in
all
respects
the
iowa
code
of
professional
responsibility,
how
did
that
conduct
undermine
the
fairness
and
reliability
of
the
trial,
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
doesn't
encouraging
a
client
to
testify
truthfully
enhance
the
reliability
of
the
trial?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
the
only
effect
is
to
in
fact
have
a
trial
based
on
truthful
testimony,
how
is
that
in
any
sense
a
violation
of
any
constitutional
requirement
to
achieve
a
fair
trial?
