chief

mr.
appel,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
did
we
not
say
in
harris
against
new
york,
about
ten
or
a
dozen
years
ago
or
more,
that
the
right
to
testify
does
not
include
the
right
to
testify
falsely?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
it's
a
corollary
of
what
justice
marshall
has
just
suggested.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
taking
his
statements,
the
respondent's
statements,
at
their
face
value,
the
lawyer
was
urging
him
not
to
commit
a
crime--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--that
he
proposed
to
commit.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
basically
any
different
from
his
saying
that:
i
think
i'll
go
out
and
shoot
that
witness,
the
one
eye
witness,
and
the
lawyer
talks
him
out
of
shooting
the
eye
witness?
fundamentally
any
different?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
grady.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
do
you
argue
that
there
is
some
right
to
testify
falsely
on
the
part
of...
not
the
lawyer
now,
but
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
a
witness?
that
there
is
some
right
to
testify
falsely
if
will
help
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
at
most,
all
the
lawyer
did
here,
if
it
had
any
impact,
was
to
dissuade
him
from
committing
perjury.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
we
have
at
least
three
cases
where
we've
addressed
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--havens,
and
harris
against
new
york.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
right
is
it
that
you're
urging
on
us?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
there
was
no
disclosure
here
by
the
lawyer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then,
let's
take
that
other,
harsher
case.
if
he
said
he
was
going
to
go
out
and
kill
or
persuade
somebody
to
kill
the
principal
witness,
would
you
say
that
that
is
a
different
kind
of
a
felony
from
committing
perjury
or
suborning
perjury?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
about,
let's
make
it
gentler,
then.
he's
going
to
bribe
a
witness.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
somewhere
between
suborning
perjury
and
murder?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
aren't
they
all
in
the
same
category?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
don't
he
concealing
perjury?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
attorney-client
relationship
has
terminated
at
that
point,
after
the
verdict.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let's
take
the
other
extreme,
then,
the
one
that
justice
stevens
and
i
were
putting
to
you.
suppose
he
actually
killed
one
of
the
major
witnesses
against
him,
carried
that
out.
would
the
lawyer
be
required
to
conceal
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
they're
both
felonies.
they're
both
felonies,
aren't
they?
and
they're
both
done
to
get
himself
off.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
would
you
say
if,
right
before
the
defense
rests,
the
defendant
then
said
to
his
lawyer,
i'm
going
to
testify
thus
and
so,
and
he
immediately
gets
up
and
walks
on
the
stand
to
testify
falsely?
at
that
point
in
this
hypothetical,
the
defense
counsel
gets
up
and
says,
if
the
court
please...
or
goes
to
the
bench,
rather,
not
in
the
hearing
of
the
jury:
i
am
bound
under
the
ethical
standards
of
the
profession
to
ask
the
court
immediately
to
let
me
withdraw
from
this
case.
the
judge
is
likely
to
say:
why?
i
am
unwilling
to
disclose
the
reason,
but
the
reason
has
to
do
with
the
testimony
the
defendant
is
about
to
give.
well,
that
tells
the
judge--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--doesn't
it?
could
he
do
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
has
he
disclosed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
jury
is
still
not
informed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
do
you
have
anything
further,
counsel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
