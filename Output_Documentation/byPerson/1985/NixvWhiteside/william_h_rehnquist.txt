justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
appel,
let
me
interrupt
just
a
minute.
what
is
the
source
of
this
law
that
you're
talking
about,
the
duty
of
the
lawyer,
the
standard
applied?
we
have
iowa
law
before
us,
and
that
was
the
jurisdiction
in
which
this
case
arose.
you
have
mentioned
the
model
penal
code,
and
apparently
you've
given
us
some
of
your
own
ideas.
do
those
really
have
any
relevance?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
can't
we
say
that
without
affirmatively
adopting
some
standard,
from
heaven
knows
where,
as
to
what
the
duties
of
a
lawyer
are
in
this
situation?
well,
hasn't
the
bar
of
the
state
of
iowa
already
declared
a
standard
of
the
professional
conduct
of
lawyers
admitted
to
practice
in
their
courts?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
can't
lay
down
a
canon
of
professional
ethics
that
violates
the
federal
constitution.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
rather,
it
can,
but
it
won't
prevail
on
federal
habeas.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
has
perjury
ever
been
recognized
as
part
of
the
adversary
system?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
wonder
how
much
of
an
impairment
there
is
at
all.
there
are
certainly
cases
from
this
court,
an
opinion
of
justice
cardozo's
back
in
the
thirties,
i
think,
that
said
not
only
is
potential
criminal
conduct
not
protected
by
the
confidence,
but
even
a
scheme
to
commit
fraud
is
not
protected.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
during
the
trial.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
is
the
conflict
different
in
the
case
which
the
chief
justice
has
put
to
you
than
in
the
case
we
have
before
us?
in
each
case
the
lawyer
urges
the
client
not
to
do
something
which
is
unlawful,
the
client
apparently
goes
ahead
and
says,
i'm
going
to
do
it
anyway.
and
then
the
lawyer
says:
all
right,
i'm
going
to
impeach
you,
i'm
going
to
advise
the
judge.
isn't
there
just
as
great
a
conflict
whether
the
client
is
talking
about
bribing
a
witness
or
killing
a
witness
as
there
is
in
the
case
where
he
says
he's
going
to
commit
perjury,
isn't
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can't
you
answer
that
yes
or
no?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
does
that
distinguish
those
three
cases
one
from
another?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
two
hypotheticals
from
the
present?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you're
not--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--you're
simply...
that
may
satisfy
you
as
an
answer.
it's
just
utterly
unconvincing
to
me
as
to
why
the
three
shouldn't
be
treated
the
same
way
for
conflict
of
interest
purposes.
and
what
about,
suppose
there
had
been
two
defendants
in
this
case,
they
were
joint
defendants,
co-defendants,
they
each
had
separate
lawyers.
each
of
them
told
his
lawyer
privately:
i'm
going
to
commit
perjury.
the
one
lawyer
says:
oh,
don't
do
that;
you
may
be...
you
know,
it's
just
a
bad
thing
to
do,
it's
the
wrong
thing
to
do,
and
you
may
be
indicted
for
perjury.
that's
all
he
says,
and
the
guy
says,
well,
i
guess
i
better
not.
and
the
other
fellow
does
what
this
lawyer
did,
and
so
the
fellow
says,
i
guess
i
better
not.
and
in
both
cases
he's
deprived
of
a
chance
to
commit
perjury.
but
you
draw
a
distinction
between
the
two?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
the
eighth
circuit
accepted
a
fact
finding
against
you
on
that
point,
didn't
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
did
you
urge
that
as
an
alternative
ground
for
affirmance
in
your
brief?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
your
view
of
this
initial
interview
where
the
attorney
tells
the
client
that
he
can
fully
disclose
because
none
of
it
will
ever
be
repeated,
does
the
attorney
have
to
go
ahead
and
mention
the
instances
which
are
exceptions
to
the
confidentiality,
where
there's
a
threat
of
committing
fraud,
where
there's
a
threat
of
committing
a
crime?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
don't
tell
the
client
the
actual
state
of
what
the
law
is
respecting
the
confidentiality
of
the
lawyer-client
privilege.
you
give
kind
of
a
gloss
to
it
to
indicate
it's
a
lot
more
sweeping
than
it
is?
