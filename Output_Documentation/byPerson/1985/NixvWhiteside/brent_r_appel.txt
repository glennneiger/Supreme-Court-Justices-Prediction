mr.
brent
r.
appel
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
interesting
case
raises
questions
regarding
the
proper
role
of
the
federal
court
in
reviewing
the
conduct
of
an
attorney
who
is
faced
with
a
client
whom
he
has
good
cause
to
believe
is
about
to
commit
perjury
in
a
state
court
criminal
trial.
in
a
nutshell,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
admonitions
by
an
attorney
violated
the
right
to
effective
assistance
of
counsel,
the
right
to
testify,
and
due
process
of
law.
i
think
the
best
way
i
can
assist
the
court
this
afternoon
first
is
a
rendition
of
the
facts,
because
there
are
significant
constitutional
factual
issues
raised
by
the
record
that
the
court
should
be
informed
of.
secondly,
i'll
dive
directly
into
the
merits
of
this
case.
the
state's
position
is
that
where
the
only
effect
of
admonition
is
the
exclusion
of
perjured
testimony
at
trial
it
is
not
a
basis
for
habeas
corpus
reversal
of
a
state
court
criminal
conviction.
secondly
and
consistently
with
the
first
argument,
the
state's
position
is
that
strickland
v.
washington
provides
guidance
for
analyzing
the
facts
in
this
case,
and
that:
first,
the
facts
reveal
no
error
of
counsel
that
is
outside
the
wide
range
of
professionally
competent
assistance;
and
second,
even
if
there
were
such
errors,
actual
prejudice
in
the
sense
of
substantial
likelihood
that
the
jury
verdict
would
have
been
affected
is
not
present
here.
let's
take
our
voyage
through
the
facts.
whiteside
and
two
companions
in
the
early
morning
hours
approached
calvin
love's
small
apartment,
where
he
was
sleeping
with
his
girlfriend.
they
obtained
entry
to
the
apartment
and
a
heated
argument
occurred
over
drugs.
love
arose
from
his
bed
and
was
stabbed
by
calvin...
by
the
defendant
here,
whiteside
as
a
result
of
the
stabbing,
whiteside
fled,
disposed
of
the
knife.
but
before
he
could
make
arrangements
to
flee
to
michigan,
he
was
arrested
by
police.
calvin
whiteside
died
shortly
thereafter
at
the
cedar
rapids
hospital.
whiteside's
conflict
with
the
judicial
system
began
almost
immediately.
his
first
appointed
attorneys
were
former
prosecutors
and,
after
several
session
meeting
with
his
attorneys,
the
attorneys
approached
the
state
trial
court
and
moved
to
withdraw
and
whiteside
testified
he
just
didn't
want
these
attorneys.
when
asked
why,
he
said:
well,
they're
former
prosecutors;
i
don't
feel
comfortable
with
them.
at
that
time
he
then
insisted
on
the
appointment
of
an
attorney
by
the
name
of
thomas
cailor.
the
state
trial
court
would
not
allow
that
appointment
because
cailor's
law
partner
was
already
representing
one
of
the
companions
of
whiteside
who
was
present
at
the
scene
of
the
crime,
thereby
raising
a
potential
issue
of
multiple
representation.
nonetheless,
statute
insisted
he
wanted
cailor
to
represent
him.
finally,
gary
robinson
was
appointed
by
the
court
to
represent
whiteside.
what
this
fact
shows...
what
this
series
of
facts
show
is
that
whiteside
knew
how
to
complain
about
attorneys
and
was
not
shy
about
expressing
those
views
to
the
court.
robinson
immediately
began
a
zealous
defense
of
whiteside
on
the
charges
of
murder.
in
the
69
days
before
trial,
he
met
with
his
client
23
times
or
more,
and
i
think
the
record
demonstrates
the
very
effective
character
of
robinson's
representation.
at
the
beginning
of
his
representation,
he
met
with
whiteside
in
his
jail
cell
and
was
presented
with
a
written
piece
of
paper
that
purported
to
describe
the
character
of
transactions
that
led
to
white's
death.
and
in
that
written
statement
the
following
words
appear:
"he
was
pulling
a
pistol
from
underneath
the
pillow
in
bed
just
prior
to
the
stabbing.
"
and
his
attorney
asked,
did
you
see
the
gun?
did
you
actually
see
the
gun?
and
the
answer
was
no,
but
i
thought
for
sure
he
had
a
gun.
it
was
also
revealed
that
whiteside
had
some
assistance
in
preparing
the
statement.
consistently
throughout
the
representation,
then,
whiteside
said
that
he
did
not
see
a
gun,
but
thought
that
the
deceased
did
have
a
gun.
he
though
this
because
calvin
love
had
a
reputation
for
being
armed.
he
thought
that
because
the
night
of
th
homicide
he
instructed
his
girlfriend,
in
the
heat
of
the
argument,
to
get
his
piece,
which
is
slang
of
course
for
a
weapon.
robinson
conducted
an
independent
investigation
to
determine
if
a
weapon
actually
existed.
he
talked
to
the
three
eyewitnesses
who
were
on
the
scene
of
the
crime,
and
they
did
not
see
a
weapon.
and
there
were
two
police
searches,
really,
of
the
small
apartment.
the
first
was
what
has
been
characterized
as
a
cursory
search,
and
no
doubt
it
was,
several
minutes
after
police
arrived
on
the
scene,
and
they
did
not
find
a
gun.
the
apartment
was
then
padlocked
and
about
an
hour
later
the
police
id
team
arrived
and
searched
for
a
weapon
and
did
not
find
a
gun.
with
that,
robinson
was
convinced
that
indeed
there
was
no
gun,
but
that
the
best
defense
would
be
that
the
defendant
reasonably
thought
that
calvin
love
while
he
was
in
his
bed
was
armed,
and
that's
how
the
defense
proceeded.
but
about
a
week
before
trial,
the
defendant,
in
his
own
words,
"got
nervous"
about
his
upcoming
defense,
and
in
a
question
and
answer
period
with
his
attorney
he
stated
that
he
saw
something
metallic
in
love's
hands.
and
with
that,
the
two
lawyers
who
were
present,
robinson
and
an
associate,
donna
paulson,
stopped
him
and
said,
where
did
this
metallic
item
come
from?
you
haven't
told
us
anything
about
that
before.
and,
in
whiteside's
words...
and
these
are
important:
"in
howard
cooke's
case
there
was
a
gun.
"
"if
i
don't
say
i
saw
a
gun,
i'm
dead.
"
with
that,
his
lawyers
were
shocked
and
they
issued
anti-perjury
admonitions.
specifically,
the
admonitions
were:
number
one,
it's
not
necessary
to
say
that
you
actually
saw
a
gun
to
have
a
defense
here;
you
could
present
the
argument
you
reasonably
believed
a
gun
was
present.
the
lawyers
said
they
would
not
allow
perjury
in
the
courts
of
iowa
and
that
they
would
seek
to
withdraw
if
he
insisted
upon
presenting
perjured
testimony.
if
perjured
testimony
was
presented,
robinson
told
his
client
he
would
advise
the
court
of
that
fact.
and
finally...
and
this
is
interesting
and
i'll
quote
it
completely...
robinson
told
his
client:
"i
probably
would
be
allowed
to
impeach
that
particular
testimony.
"
that's
the
end
of
the
admonitions.
and
with
that,
robinson
instructed
his
client
to
think
about
it,
and
in
the
end
whiteside
dropped
his
assertion
that
there
was
something
metallic
on
love's
hands.
and
indeed,
the
question
and
answer
periods
in
later
meetings
continued;
and
whiteside
appeared
at
his
criminal
trial
and
testified
fully
about
the
events
of
that
evening
and
testified
why
he
thought
that
indeed
calvin
love
had
a
gun,
but
under
questioning
did
not
say
that
he
actually
saw
the
gun.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
well,
i
think
there's
no
question--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--under
the
iowa
code
of
professional
responsibility,
which
follows
closely
the
aba
model
code,
a
lawyer
cannot
knowingly
used
perjured
testimony
at
trial.
and
i
think
it's
fair
to
say--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--well,
he
must
have
more
than
a
mere
suspicion,
clearly.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
i
think,
once
again,
a
lawyer
has
to
know...
and
under
the
model
penal
code
definition,
for
instance,
of
what
"know"
is,
it
means
a
high
probability.
i
would
even
accept
for
argument
purpose
reasonable...
without
reasonable
doubt.
but
let
me
carry
this
a
step
further,
because
i
think
i
see
where
you're
heading.
a
lawyer
before
he
or
she
issues
anti-perjury
admonitions
probably
should
know
beyond
reasonable
doubt
that
his
client
is
preparing
to
commit
perjury.
i
think
the
facts
clearly
bear
that
out
in
this
case
nonetheless--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--i
think
they
do.
they
have
relevance
for
the
sixth
amendment
question,
and
the
sixth
amendment
question
is:
was
somehow
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
provided
here?
and
the
way
we
analyze
sixth
amendment
cases
i
think
is
presented
in
faretta
and
herring
v.
new
york.
in
faretta
we
learned
that
the
sixth
amendment
constitutionalizes
in
an
adversary
trial
the
right
to
defend
oneself.
and
in
herring
v.
new
york,
we
learned
that
elements
of
the
adversary
system
that
are
universally
accepted
and
traditional
are
incorporated
within
that
sixth
amendment,
for
instance
the
right
for
summation
at
the
close
of
evidence
even
in
a
non-jury
case.
i
submit
to
you
that
the
sixth
amendment
here
is
not
so
broad
as
to
cover
an
extraordinary
obligation
on
the
part
of
a
defense
attorney
to
conduct
himself
in
an
unethical
manner
and
offer
perjured
testimony
in
an
upcoming
criminal
trial
at
the
request
of
the
defendant.
that's
how
it
becomes
relevant.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
yes,
it
has.
the
iowa
rule
once
again
is
that
a
lawyer
shall
not
knowingly
used
perjured
testimony
at
trial,
and
that's
similar
to
the
historical
traditions
of
the
profession.
and
it's
clear,
the
iowa
supreme
court
held
indeed,
that
lawyer
robinson
acted
in
the
highest
traditions
of
the
legal
profession.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
because
of
that
long
history
that's
embraced
in
the
iowa
ethical
rules,
it
is
indeed
an
extraordinary
proposition
and
an
extension
of
the
right
to
counsel
beyond
what
has
ever
been
recognized
in
any
of
the
cases
of
this
court
to
suggest
that
the
defendant
has
a
right
to
the
unethical
assistance
of
an
attorney
simply
at
his
request.
this
court
has
never
held
that,
nor
would
it
qualify
under
faretta
and
herring
as
being
something
that's
universally
accepted
as
part
of
the
adversary
system.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
yes.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
right.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
to
start
with--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--that's
absolutely
correct,
and
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
applying
what
amounted
to
a
per
se
approach.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
under
cuyler
v.
sullivan,
which
as
you
recall
is
that
multiple
representation
case,
there
was
no
need
to
demonstrate
any
prejudice
on
the
facts.
number
one,
that
was
a
misapplication
of
cuyler
v.
sullivan.
but
i
think
it's
clear
that
there
is
no
justification
for
a
per
se
rule
in
this
case.
in
cronic
v.
united
states,
we
describe
why
per
se
rules
are
sometimes
applied.
first,
there
are
some
kinds
of
situations
that
are
so
inherently
prejudicial
that
we
know
that
nine
times
out
of
ten
or
maybe
even
99
out
of
100
that
there's
going
to
be
adverse
impact
at
trial.
and
the
multiple
representation
setting
is
a
good
example.
where
there
are
three
defendants
in
the
same
room
and
there
are
multiple
crimes,
it's
almost
inevitable
that
there
are
going
to
be
conflicting
interests,
and
therefore,
under
cuyler
v.
sullivan
and
holloway,
we
take
a
more
restrictive
approach
to
prejudice.
but
that's
not
the
case
here.
the
alleged
conflict
of
interest,
which
i
submit
to
you
wasn't
a
conflict
of
legally
recognized
interests
at
least,
is
not
of
the
character
that
it
inherently
taints
the
truth-finding
process
that
occurred
at
trial.
and
secondly,
we
have
a
really
good
record--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--surely.
it's
the
ultimate
irony,
and
that's
why
the
state's
first
position
on
the
merits
is
that
where
the
only
impact
on
the
trial
process
is
exclusion
of
perjured
testimony
that
ought
not
be
a
basis
for
reversal.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
that's
correct.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
that's
entirely
correct
indeed--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--i
think
that
helps
demonstrate,
number
one,
the
lack
of
prejudice
in
the
case.
number
two,
i
think
it
also
shows
that
this
contest
of
wills
between
the
attorney
and
his
client
did
not
so
undermine
the
attorney-client
relationship
that
it
wasn't
possible
to
mount
an
effective
defense.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
i
think
it
would
be
a
different
case.
nonetheless,
i
would
argue
that
where
a
defendant
is
determined
to
commit
perjury
on
the
stand
the
lawyer
may
refuse
to
call
that
individual.
so
i
would
say
that,
even
had
the
lawyer
looked
at
whiteside
and
said,
you
don't
take
the
stand,
that
that
would
be
constitutionally
defensible.
justice
rehnquist,
i
want
to
get
back
to
your
question.
absolutely
correct,
this
supreme
court
is
not
sitting
as
a
state
bar
committee
to
decide
which
possible
approach
to
the
perjury
dilemma
is
best.
the
only
reason
that
this
case
is
here
is
to
determine,
of
course,
what
the
constitutional
boundaries
might
be.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
that's--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--that's
correct.
and
so
what
we're
looking
for
here
are
what
the
constitutional
limitations
are,
and
that's
why
i
discussed
the
faretta
and
herring
approach
to
the
right
to
counsel.
if
it
had
been
a
part
of
the
adversary
system
that
an
attorney
should
put
on
testimony
that
he
or
she
knows
is
false
and
should
argue
the
case
to
the
jury,
which
is
what
the
respondent's
suggesting
here,
then
perhaps
maybe
we'd
have
a
right
to
counsel
violation.
but
the
eighth
circuit's
holding
is
a
tremendous
extension
of
light
to
counsel
beyond
any
case
that
i'm
familiar
with--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--i
think
there--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--yes,
the
court
of
appeals
indicated
that
there
was
a
right
to
testify,
and
that
by
being
put
in
the
position
of
having
to
choose
between
the
right
to
effective
assistance
of
counsel
and
the
right
to
testify,
the
lawyer
in
this
case
violated
both.
i
think
there
perhaps
is
a
right--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
i
think
the
grayson
v.
united
states
suggests--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--right.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
yes,
you
did,
in
harris
v.
new
york
and
in
grayson.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
and
indeed,
it
might
be
argued
that
the
lawyers'
admonition
had
an
effect
on
the
right
to
testify.
of
course
it
did,
but
that's
what
it
was
specifically
designed
to
do,
as
do
a
whole
host
of
other
statutes.
the
perjury
statute,
for
instance,
has
an
effect
on
the
right
to
testify.
it's
designed
to
inhibit
people
from
getting
on
the
stand
and
testifying
falsely.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
that's
correct.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
that's
correct.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
i
think
it
is
not,
because
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
an
unethical
attorney
to
present
false
evidence,
and
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
mount
the
stand
and
testify
falsely.
and
therefore,
the
so-called
conflict
of
interest
that
occurred
here
was
a
specious
one.
there
was
no
constitutionally
protected
interest
at
stake
on
the
part
of
mr.
whiteside
here.
i
think
it's
clear
as
well
that,
whatever
the
proper
admonitions
might
have
been
in
this
case...
and
i
know
in
the
court
of
appeals's
opinion
there's
this
business
about,
i
might,
i
probably
would
be
allowed
to
impeach,
is
discussed
at
some
length.
the
record
shows
that
whiteside,
when
he
was
at
his
post-trial
hearing
on
his
motion
for
a
new
trial,
he
relied
upon
the
so-called
threat
to
withdraw.
he
said...
the
question
was
posed
to
him:
did
you
have
a
conflict
your
attorney?
answer:
well,
i
don't
know
if
i'd
call
it
a
conflict,
but
he
said
something
about
withdrawing.
well,
plainly,
under
any
of
the
rules
of
ethics
it's
proper,
and
all
the
traditions,
it's
proper
for
the
attorney
to
withdraw
in
light
of
a
plan
of
a
client
to
commit
perjury.
so
i
think
the
reliance
on
the
so-called
impeachment
admonition
was
improper.
indeed,
the
impeachment
admonition
isn't
that
far
off,
either,
because
under
iowa
law
the
intention
of
a
client
to
commit
a
future
crime
is
not
protected
by
attorney-client
privilege.
and
under
the
canons
that
you've
described,
mr.
chief
justice,
a
lawyer
shall
not
knowingly
use
perjured
evidence,
and
he
is
allowed
to
reveal
the
intention
of
his
client
to
commit
a
crime
and
the
necessary
testimony
to
prevent
that
crime.
so
let
me
review
where
we
are--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--no,
he
said...
well,
the
lawyer
left
it:
think
about
that,
think
about
the
admonitions.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
no.
he
came
back
and
they
went
through
questions
and
answers
again.
the
record
is
not
clear
as
to
what
occurred
on
those
subsequent
meetings.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
yes.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
yes.
and
with
what
result--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--the
result
that
would
likely
happen
is
a
mistrial
in
that
setting,
justice
white.
but
of
course,
once
again,
that
is
not
the
situation
that
we're
facing.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
and
the
lawyer
may
well
have
an
ethical
obligation
at
that
stage
of
the
game
to
call
a
halt
to
this
proceeding.
now,
maybe
it
would
require
a
new
trial.
it
could
be,
if
it
was
highly
prejudicial,
as
well
it
might
be.
but
there's
at
least
one
case,
united
states
v.
campbell
out
of
the
ninth
circuit,
where
an
attorney
in
the
view
of
the
jury
indicated
reservations
about
the
truth
and
veracity
of
his
client's
testimony.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
that's
right.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
well,
the
burden--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--i
don't
think
there's
a
problem
in--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--that's
not
what
he
said.
he
said
that
he
was
going
to
inform
the
court
and
might
be
allowed
to
impeach
that
particular
testimony.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
he
probably
would
be
allowed
to
impeach,
is
exactly
what
he
said.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
that
could
be
implied
from
that
statement
from
the
record.
but
even
so,
at
the
post-trial
hearing
on
his
motion
for
a
new
trial,
where
the
petitioner
carries
the
burden:
did
you
have
a
conflict
with
counsel?
well,
i
don't
know
if
it
was
a
conflict;
it
might
have
been
something...
well,
i
think
he
was
going
to
withdraw.
there
appears
to
be
no
reliance
on
that
so-called
impeachment
admonition
at
all.
but
indeed,
isn't
this
an
open
and
shut
case
when
the
only
effect,
the
only
effect
of
a
lawyer's
admonition,
is
the
exclusion
of
perjured
testimony?
this
isn't
the
kind
of
case
where
habeas
corpus
relief
should
be
granted.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
yes,
that
was
part
of
it,
though
it
was
also
a
right--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--yes,
it
was.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
right.
not
by
that
label.
the
claim
was
that
the
attorney
improperly
coerced
his
client
into
making...
changing
his
testimony.
and
the
federal
court--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--well,
it
was
due
process,
but
it
was
also
that
the
attorney
acted
improperly.
the
lower
court,
lower
federal
courts,
as
you
know,
ruled
that
the
sixth
amendment
claim
was
exhausted.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
i'm
satisfied
with
that
ruling.
i
don't
think
it
would
have
been
any
different
if
it
had
gone
back
to
the
iowa
supreme
court
and
recast
it.
let's
review
where
we
are.
what
are
the
four
important
aspects
of
the
factual
record?
number
one,
i
think
it's
a
very
strong
record
in
terms
of
intent
to
testify
falsely.
in
howard
cooke's
case
there
was
a
gun;
if
i
don't
say
i
saw
a
gun,
i'm
dead.
second,
this
is
not
the
kind
of
case
where
the
fact
finder
or
the
jury
learns
about
the
lawyer's
reservations
about
the
client's
testimony.
the
judge
and
jury
did
not,
were
not
advised.
third,
the
defendant
actually
did
take
the
stand
and
he
had
his
say
in
court.
and
fourth...
i
haven't
gotten
to
this
fact...
after
the
close
of
evidence,
the
state
trial
court
asked
him
if
he
was
satisfied
with
the
representation
of
his
counsel.
once
again,
this
brings
me
back
to
my
earlier
discussion
of
how
he
fought
the
system
of
appointment
of
counsel.
he
said:
yes,
i'm
satisfied.
and
then
the
jury
came
back
with
guilty
on
second
degree
murder,
and
then
he
was
dissatisfied.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
no,
i
think
that
that
was
a
conservative
approach.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
the
record
doesn't
indicate.
i
can
speculate.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
once
again,
there
is
no
violation
of
effective
assistance
of
counsel
here
because
the
activities
of
counsel
did
not
fall
outside
the
broad
band
of
professionally
competent
counsel.
nor
is
this
a
case
where
a
per
se
approach
like
cuyler
v.
sullivan
should
be
applied.
this
is
not
inherently
damaging
to
the
fact
finding
process.
indeed,
why
do
we
hold
criminal
trials?
the
reason
why
we
have
trials
is
to
counter
that
human
tendency
to
judge
in
the
familiar
that
which
is
not
yet
fully
known.
and
that's
what
the
powell
v.
alabama
is
all
about,
the
guiding
hand
of
counsel.
why?
because,
the
next
sentence
reads:
"without
it,
though
he
be
not
guilty,
he
runs
the
risk
of
conviction
because
he
does
not
know
how
to
establish
his
innocence.
"
and
it's
hard
for
me
to
see
the
eighth
circuit's
decision
as
anything
other
than
a
topsy-turvy
approach
to
these
constitutional
rights.
one
final
aspect
of
the
record
that
i
think
we
do
need
to
discuss
about;
and
it
might
be
a
troublesome
one
for
the
state,
so
let's
get
it
clear
right
now.
at
the
discussion
between
the
court
and
whiteside
over
who
would
be
appointed
ultimately
as
his
counsel,
when
gary
robinson
was
appointed
the
court
said
that,
your
chances
of
another
change
in
attorneys
is
about
zero.
okay,
that
was
after
the
change
from
his
first
attorneys
and
the
insistence
on
thomas
cailor,
who
had
a
conflict
of
interest.
finally
he
got
an
attorney,
and
the
trial
judge
looked
down
and
said,
your
chances
of
another
change
in
attorney
are
about
zero.
does
that
mean
that
the
admonitions,
when
combined...
the
admonitions
of
counsel,
when
combined
with
this
trial
court
ruling,
does
that
mean
that
indeed
the
choice
for
the
defendant
was
to
proceed
pro
se
if
robinson
ultimately
withdrew?
might
be.
but
what
i
want
to
close
with
is
that,
where
a
defendant
insists
on
committing
perjury
at
trial
it
would
be
constitutionally
proper
to
require
him
to
proceed
pro
se.
there
would
be
no
problem
with
that
with
an
appropriate
faretta-style
warning.
of
course,
that
is
not
right,
because,
once
again,
the
witness
did
mount
the
stand
and
did
testify
fully.
i
think
i'll
reserve...
unless
there
are
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
just
briefly.
justice
o'connor,
i
wanted
to
come
back
to
the
question
that
you
raised
in
the
middle
of
my
argument
that
i
perhaps
didn't
have
an
opportunity
to
respond
to
fully.
and
you
were
asking
the
question
about
what
kind
of
standards
ought
to
be
applied.
and
in
my
view,
under
the
iowa
rules
once
again,
the
lawyer
has
to
know
about
the
proposed
use
of
perjured
testimony,
okay.
the
initial
judgment
is
that
for
the
lawyer
to
make,
much
as
any
other
tactical
decision
an
attorney
comes
upon
in
the
course
of
representation.
a
reviewing
court
then
in
reviewing
the
lawyer's
conduct
should
use
the
deferential
standards
that
are
in
washington
v.
strickland:
did
the
lawyer's
decision
to
issue
the
admonitions
in
that
case
fall
within
the
broad
range
of
professionally
competent
counsel?
and
even
though
i
get
the
drift
if
this
court
that
maybe
because
the
second
prong
of
strickland
hasn't
been
satisfied
in
this
case
you
may
not
reach
the
first
question
of
ineffective
assistance,
that's
the
proper
approach.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
sure.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
it's
a
relatively
rare
case.
the
case
books
have
some
instances
where
a
lawyer
has
an
alibi
or
a
client
presents
an
alibi
testimony
to
his
lawyer
and
then
at
trial
he
says,
oh
no,
the
crime
didn't
happen
this
way,
it
happened
that
way,
and
kind
of
demonstrates
that
he
was
actually
there.
there
are
few
cases
like
that.
but
where
it's
more
conjecture,
mere
speculation...
that
is
of
course
not
this
case--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--we
don't
have
a
disagreement.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
the
bottom
line
here
is
that
the
problem
the
defendant
had
was
not
that
he
had
a
less
than
zealous
attorney;
it's
that
the
prosecution
had
an
airtight
case,
and
that
is
not
grounds
for
reversal
of
a
conviction.
