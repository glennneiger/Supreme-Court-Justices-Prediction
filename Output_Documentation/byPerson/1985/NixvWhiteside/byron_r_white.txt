justice
byron
r.
white
one
of
the
elements
of
an
inadequate
assistance
of
counsel
is
there's
got
to
be
some
prejudice.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
the
argument
for
the
defendant
has
to
be
that
his
being
deprived
of
perjured
testimony
is
prejudice.
justice
byron
r.
white
i'd
say
all
you
have
to
do
is
convince
us
that
that
isn't
so
and
you
win
your
case,
don't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
without
all
these
other
arguments?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
hard
to
say.
if
a
court
says,
sure,
he
was
going
to
produce...
he
was
going
to
perjure
himself,
but
nevertheless
we're
worried
about
the
truth-finding
process,
that's
a
contradiction
in
terms.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
what
the
lawyers
did
might
be
subject
to
sanction--
justice
byron
r.
white
--under
the
state
rules
of
ethics.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
why
do
we
have
to
argue
so
much
about
the
conduct
of
counsel?
would
this
be
a
different
case
if
the
defendant
had,
faced
with
the
challenge
of
the
lawyer,
not
taken
the
stand
at
all
in
your
view,
or
is
it
just
the
same?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
client...
after
the
lawyer
said
he
would
withdraw
and
so
on,
did
the
client
then
say,
i
won't
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
well,
but
then
he,
without
any
further
communication,
he
put
him
on
the
stand?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
suppose
this.
suppose
the
client
then
had
gotten
on
the
stand
and
in
the
course
of
his
examination
he
said
he
saw
something
in
his
hand.
well,
the
lawyer
could
have
cured
it
all,
if
he
thought
he
was
going
to
commit
perjury,
by
getting
out
of
the
case
or
at
least
trying
to
get
out.
but
if
he
gets
surprised,
may
he
then
say,
may
i
approach
the
bench,
and
say
to
the
judge
that
this
fellow's
lying?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
he
could
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
think
that
he
could...
that
he
as
a
lawyer
could
be
permitted
to
go
on
the
stand
and
testify
and
impeach
him--
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
you
don't
know
what
the
client
would
have
done
if
all
the
controversy
had
said,
unless
you
agree
not
to
do
that
i'm
going
to
withdraw.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
know
what
the
client
would
have
done
then.
he
probably
would
have
said,
well,
go
ahead
and
withdraw,
george.
justice
byron
r.
white
i'll
get
another
lawyer
and
i
won't
tell
him
the
truth,
ever.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
lawyer
said
more
than
that.
he
said,
if
you
do
i'm
going
to
tell
the
judge
and
testify
against
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
said
he'd
be
willing
to
impeach
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
he
said
he'd
be
willing
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
court
of
appeals
would
put
all
cases
in
one
bag.
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
what
the
evidence
was
with
respect
to
whether
the
client
was
going
to
tell
a
falsehood
on
the
stand.
i
mean,
as
the
case
comes
to
us
i
take
it
the
court
of
appeals
decided,
even
if
it's
perfectly
clear
and
no
one
would
doubt
that
the
client
planned
to
commit
perjury,
even
so
the
lawyer
may
not
threaten
him
with
anything
that
would
keep
him
from
saying
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
no
matter
what
the
degree
of
certainty
that
the
client
is
going
to
commit
perjury?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
yes,
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
as
the
case
comes
to
us,
that's
the
given,
that
the
client
was
going
to
commit
perjury?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
no.
but
that's
the
way
it
comes
to
us.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
should
the
conduct
of
the
lawyer
rub
off
on
the
conviction
if
the
conviction
has
been
accurately
and
truthfully
arrived
at?
justice
byron
r.
white
accurately
and
truthfully
because
there
wasn't
any
perjured
testimony
in
the
trial.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
the
way
the
case
comes
to
us.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
can't
they
be
taken
care
of
by
policing
the
defense
bar?
justice
byron
r.
white
teaching
the
defense
bar
how
to
act.
why
should
it
really
involve
setting
convictions
aside?
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
there's
some
prejudice?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
should
all
of
this...
even
if
you're
right
about
the
lawyer's
conduct,
again
why
should
this
have
a
consequence
for
the
conviction?
justice
byron
r.
white
his
right
is
not...
his
right
certainly
wasn't
to
try
to
mislead
the
jury
by
perjured
testimony.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
seem
to
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
can
he
at
least,
say,
try
to
talk
him
out
of
it,
then
he'd
say:
if
you
still
insist,
i'm
going
to
try...
i'm
going
to
withdraw?
he
can
say
that,
can't
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
can
go
that
far.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then,
if
he
talks
him
out
of
it
using
that
threat
you
wouldn't
be
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
he
testifies
falsely
and
he's
acquitted.
may
the
lawyer
then
say
he
committed
perjury?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
wouldn't
you
think
this
was
a
relatively
rare
case,
where
a
lawyer...
where
the
defendant
just
says,
i'm
going
to
commit
perjury,
and
it's
so
clear?
because
you
would
concede
that
the
lawyer
may
not...
if
there's
a
real
doubt
about
the
truth
of
the
thing--
justice
byron
r.
white
--you
wouldn't
be
here
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
even
if
the
lawyer
is
himself
completely
convinced
that
the
story
his
client
is
telling
is
false.
