justice
thurgood
marshall
doesn't
the
right
to
testify
carry
with
it
the
right
to
testify
truthfully?
justice
thurgood
marshall
--i
don't
see
why
you're
worried
about
that
at
all.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
don't
know
whether
that
doesn't
raise
a
question
in
my
mind.
why
would
you
ask
a
question
like
that?
would
there
be
a
suspicion
that
he
hadn't
acted
properly?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why?
what
provoked
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
in
this
particular
case
when
your
client
said,
i'm
going
to
perjure
myself,
what
redress
do
you
think
the
lawyer
should
take?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
don't
need
any
facts
for
my
question.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'd
like
to
get
an
answer
to
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
it
didn't
say
that
he
did
not,
did
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
just
silent
on
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
we'll
take
a
hypothetical.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
witness
says,
i'm
going
to
perjure
myself
and
i'm
going
to
say
that
i
saw
a
gun.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
can
the
lawyer
do?
what
can
he
do
and
what
should
he
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
client
says,
i'm
going
to
perjure
myself.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
at
the
same
time
as
it
is
in
this
trial.
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
still
asking
what
he
could
do.
he
said
he
could
withdraw.
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
what
else
could
he
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
else
could
an
attorney
do
other
than
to
withdraw?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
did
the
attorney
stop
him
from
testifying
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
what
else
could
the
attorney
have
done
other
than
what
he
did?
justice
thurgood
marshall
didn't
he
have
23
meetings?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
mean,
they
did
a
lot
of
discussing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
want
more
discussion?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
by
any
chance
say
that
the
attorney
should
have
just
sat
there
and
let
him
go
ahead
and
not
said
anything
about
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
he
had
let
him
perjure
himself,
he'd
have
been
subject
to
disbarment.
justice
thurgood
marshall
wouldn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
does
the
code...
don't
you
have
a
code
of
ethics
in
iowa
that
says
that
if
you
put
on,
knowingly
produce
perjured
testimony
you're
disbarred?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
said
wouldn't
that
happen
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
wouldn't
be
disbarred?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
would
suggest
you
not
try
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'd
suggest
you
not
try
it.
i
mean,
i
don't
know
of
anything
worse
for
a
lawyer
to
do
than
to
produce
perjured
testimony,
because
he's
suborning
it
and
that's
a
crime,
to
suborn
perjury.
isn't
it
in
iowa?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
couldn't
your
client
have
complained
to
the
judge
that
the
lawyer
interfered
with
him
or
threatened
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
couldn't
he
have
gone
to
the
judge
and
said,
judge,
my
lawyer
has
threatened
me
by
having
me
charged
with
perjury?
why
couldn't
he
have
done
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
right.
