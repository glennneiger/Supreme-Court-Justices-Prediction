mr.
grady,
it
would
help
me
if
you
would
summarize
exactly
what
you
think
the
lawyer
should
have
done
in
this
case.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
he
did
that.
he
succeeded.
the
lawyer
tried
to
dissuade
his
client.
what
else
should
he
have
done?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
should
the
lawyer
have
permitted
him
to
go
ahead
and
testify
falsely?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
think
counsel
should
have
permitted
the
defendant
to
testify?
that's
what
ca-8
said.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
if
you
look
at
page
20,
page
89,
i
think
you'll
find
they
did
say
that.
judge
gibson
thought
the
court
of
appeals
said
that.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
what
do
you
think?
i
understood
you
to
say
you
thought
the
lawyer
finally,
after
trying
to
dissuade
him,
should
have
permitted
the
defendant
to
testify.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
answer
to
my
question
is
the
lawyer
should
have
permitted
the
defendant
to
testify
and
kept
his
mouth
shut?
