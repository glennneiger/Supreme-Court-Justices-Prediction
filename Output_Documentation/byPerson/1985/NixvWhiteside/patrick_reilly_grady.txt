mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
in
light
of
what
was
discussed
here
previously
in
mr.
appel's
opening
statement,
it's
important
to
emphasize
what
was
the
limited
holding
of
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
and
that
is,
whatever
counsel's
duties
may
or
may
not
be
when
their
confronted
with
a
client
who
insists
on
testifying
to
what
that
attorney
believes
to
be
false
information,
that
attorney
cannot
disclose
or
threaten
to
disclose
to
the
fact
finder
his
or
her
disbelief
in
the
client
and
the
fact
that
the
client
is
lying.
and
that's
what
the
attorney
threatened
to
do
here.
that's
what
puts
counsel
and
the
defendant
at
odds,
and
that
is
why
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
applying
the
presumptive
level
of
prejudice
in
this
particular
case,
because
there
was
a
complete
deprivation
of
counsel.
and
that
is
why
this
court
should
affirm
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
now,
another
reason
which
would
allow
this
court
to
affirm--
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
--i
don't
believe
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
was
saying,
but
the
limited
portion
of
their
holding
is
simply
that
an
attorney
cannot
threaten
or
actually
disclose.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
that
is
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
that...
and
the
reason--
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
--that
is
how
the
court
of
appeals
assumed
it.
now,
we
are
not
conceding
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
even
correct
in
reaching
that.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
that's
correct.
and
the
problem
with
this
is
it's
not
necessarily
just
limited
to
the
situation
as
it
arose
here
simply
right
before
trial,
but
this
goes
all
the
way
back
to
the
initial
interview
that
an
attorney
might
have
with
a
particular
client,
where
that
attorney,
as
is
normal,
is
going
to
guarantee
that
client
confidentiality
and
the
fact
that
that
confidentiality
will
not
be
breached;
and
that
for
an
attorney...
and
the
lower
federal
cases
that
have
reviewed--
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
--that's
a
wholly
different
matter,
and
the
reason
for
that--
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
--the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
purpose
of
the
attorney-client
privilege
as
set
out
in
this
court's
cases...
for
example,
upjohn
and
fisher...
indicates
that
for
the
defendant
to
be
able
to
give
the
lawyer
the
defendant's
version
of
what
happened
is
necessary
for
the
attorney
to
be
able
to
advise
the
client,
to
develop
a
strategy
of
the
defense,
and
to
actually
intelligently
exercise
the
client's
option
whether
or
not
to
take
the
stand.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
well,
okay.
it's
still
different
from
the
situation
with
the
witness
because
having
the
client...
having
the
attorney-client
privilege
remain
inviolate
and
having
the
attorney
still
give
his
guiding
hand
to
the
client
is
part
of
the
traditional
adversarial
system.
nothing
in
terms
of
bribing
jurors
or
threatening
witnesses
has
ever
been
recognized
as
part
of
the
adversarial
system
in
this
country
or
in
any
other
country
that
i
know
of,
and
that
is
an
important--
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
--no,
it
hasn't.
in
fact,
as
was
brought
up
in
an
earlier
question,
it's
clear,
and
we
are
not
urging
and
the
eighth
circuit
is
not
urging,
that
there
is
certainly
not
a
constitutional
right
to
perjure
oneself.
the
question
is,
however,
is
what
enforcement
mechanism
is
necessary,
in
light
of
the
impairment
on
the
attorney-client
privilege
that
this
would
bring
out,
that
is
proper
to
balance
both
of
those
interests.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
well,
again,
that's
why
in
cases
such
as
harris
of
course
the
defendant
can
be
cross-examined
about
prior
inconsistent
statements,
a
perjury
prosecution
is
proper,
and
of
course
the
judge
can
enhance
a
sentence
if
in
fact
the
judge
believes
that
the
client...
or,
excuse
me...
the
defendant
is
going
to
perjure...
or
has
perjured
himself.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
okay.
well,
a
few
facts.
if
i
might
ask,
are
you
giving
me
a
hypothetical?
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
okay.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
okay.
the
answer
you
can
give...
and
this
is
the
first
thing
that
an
attorney
must
do
in
that
particular
situation,
and
that
is
an
attorney
must
give
the...
start
out
telling
the
client
first
basically
just
the
strategic
or
even
moral
reasons
why
it's
not
proper
or
advisable
to
testify
to
the
version
the
defendant
wants
to
give.
for
example,
he
could
point
to
other
facets
in
the
record
which
would
contradict
the
defendant.
he
could
point
to
the
fact,
again,
of
a
potential
perjury
prosecution,
or
again
point
to
the
enhanced
sentencing.
there
are
plenty
of
things
an
attorney
might
do
in
that
situation.
and
the
record
doesn't
reflect
that
the
attorney
in
this
case
in
fact
did
those
things.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
well--
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
--well,
i
think
the
record--
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
--okay.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
okay.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
okay.
again,
as
i
stated
earlier,
the
attorney
first
must
try
to
dissuade
the
client
by
using
basically
practical,
strategic
reasons
to
try
to
talk
the
client
out
of
perjuring
himself.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
okay.
at
that
point...
and
again,
this
depends
on
again
at
what
stage
in
the
proceeding
this
would
particularly
happen,
if
it's
the
day
before
trial
or
several
months
before
trial.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
or
during
the
trial.
and
that
makes
a
difference,
because,
again
as
i
think
the
deputy
attorney
general
indicated,
during
the
trial--
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
--okay,
which
would
be
shortly
before
trial?
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
okay.
at
that
particular
point,
the
attorney,
if
he
cannot
dissuade
the
client,
the
options
that
have
been
spelled
out
either
allow
the
attorney
to
attempt
to
withdraw,
which
again...
and
what
this
does,
and
this
is
the
only
way
that
this
makes
sense,
is
one
has
to
look
at
the
implications
of
that,
that
goes
back
to
the
overall
attorney-client
privilege,
in
the
sense
that
if
you
allow
the
attorney
to
withdraw--
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
--right.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
well,
if
i
might
explain,
the
problem
with
the
withdrawal
method
is
that
at
that
point
if
another
attorney
is
appointed
then
the
client's
simply
going
to
tell
the
attorney
the
last
story.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
okay.
the
other...
another
option
that's
been
recommended
is
the
fact
that
the
client
would
have
to
testify
by
narrative.
that
way
the
client
would
be
able
to
put
the
story
on,
but
the
attorney
would
not
have
a
conflict
in
that
the
attorney
would
not
be
assisting
in
the
alleged
perjured
testimony.
the
criticism
of
that
particular
method
is
that--
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
--in
this
particular
case?
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
he
did
not
prevent
him
from
taking
the
stand,
no.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
well,
the
attorney
could
have
first
started
out
with
attempting
to
talk
the
client
out
of
it
through
lesser
methods.
what
the
attorney
did
in
this
particular
case
is
jump
all
the
way
to
the
end
of
the
spectrum,
which--
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
--something
like
that.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
they
did.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
certainly
this
particular
fact
situation
demands
more
discussion.
when
this
particular
whatever,
conflict
arises,
it
does
demand
more
discussion.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
there
is
a
point
where,
if
it
is
impracticable
to
withdraw,
i
suppose
the
attorney...
there
is
the
method,
the
attorney
can
go
and
try
to
get
the
trial
judge
to
let
him
out
of
the
case.
then
if
the
trial
judge
doesn't
let
him,
it
just--
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
--well,
i
think
that--
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
--i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
that
is
in
the
code
of
professional
responsibility,
yes.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
yes.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
well,
if,
again
consistent
with
the
sixth
amendment
attorney-client
privilege,
if
the
attorney
goes
ahead
and
allows
that
testimony,
i
think
under
mannes
versus
meyers
that
the
attorney
would
probably
be
protected
in
the
long
run.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
in
the
long
run,
he
would
be
protected
against--
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
--pardon
me?
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
well,
suborning
perjury
as
it's
defined
in
iowa
would
be
for
the
attorney
first
to
either
encourage
or
pay
someone
to
actually
perjure
himself,
as
suborning
perjury
is
defined
in
the
iowa
code.
and
i
think
there
is
a
distinction
which
has
been
made,
that
there
is
a
difference
between
the
attorney
suggesting
to
the
client
how
best
to
get
around
particular
difficult
facts
and
the
fact
of
letting
the
client
testify
himself
to
those
particular
facts,
and
that's
a
distinction
i
think
that
has
to
be
made.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
what
it
particularly
did...
and
this
is
why
i
think
the
eighth
circuit's
treating
it
as
a
presumptive
prejudice
issue
is
appropriate...
is
the
fact
that
the
jury
system...
to
produce
a
reliable
result,
the
jury
system
allows
someone,
with
the
assistance
of
counsel,
of
course,
to
be
able
to
testify
as
to
their
particular
facts
of
the
event.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
there's
no
question
about
that.
the
question
is
how
far
is
the
attorney
allowed
to
go
to
get
that
result.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
well,
again,
as
the
so-called
conflict
of
interest
analysis
goes,
what
a
court
simply
looks
to
in
that
particular
situation
is
the
fact
that
the
relationship
was
changed
because
of
what
the
attorney
saw
as
conflicting
duties.
an
actual
prejudice
standard
is
not
appropriate
in
this
circumstance
because
of
the
effect
that
this
particular
instance
had
on
the
whole
attorney-client
relationship,
just
like
in
the
multiple
representation
case.
and
therefore--
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
--well,
it's
again
the
same
as--
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
--well,
again,
based
on
that
assumption,
again
that--
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
--okay.
but
again,
i
think
that
there
are
other
interests
involved
here,
and
that's
where,
for
example--
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
--well,
i
think
in
that--
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
--well,
because
the--
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
--well,
essentially
because
of
the
actual...
the
client
is
entitled
to
conflict-free
counsel,
as
this
court
has
held
in
other
cases.
and
in
the
conflict
of
interest
context
the
court
doesn't
weigh
whether
or
not
a
just
result
is
obtained.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
no,
i'm
not,
your
honor.
that's
why,
if
there
is
a
right--
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
--well,
again,
i
think
there's
two
facets
to
your
question.
first,
there
is
not
a
right
to
testify
falsely.
if
there
was
a
right
to
testify
falsely,
then
of
course
the
defendant
could
not
be
held
to
a
higher
sentence
if
there
was
a
right
to
testify
falsely.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
right.
so
that's
not
what
we're
urging.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
right,
and
because
of
those
cases
it's
clear
there
is
no
right
to
testify
falsely.
but
that
is
not
what
we're
urging.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
we
are
urging
the
right...
well,
we're
basically
urging
the
right
of
the
client
to
rely
on
the
attorney-client
privilege
and
prevent
from
disclosure.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
there
was
threatened
disclosure,
and
there
really
is
no
significant
difference
on
that.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
i
think
in
the
context
of
the
attorney-client
privilege
it
certainly
is
a
much
larger
difference,
again
in
light
of
the
adversary
proceeding.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
no
difference,
in
the
sense
of
it's
the
same
as--
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
--well,
it
falls
in
the
same
category
as
going
out
and
doing
harm
to
a
witness.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
i
don't
believe
so,
and
that's
because
of
the
impact
on
the
attorney-client
privilege
as
it
relates
to
the
adversary
system.
and
that's
where
the
disclosure
of
the
particular
perjured
testimony
goes
all
the
way
back
to
anyone's
initial
interview.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
well,
again--
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
--my
answer
that
is
no,
it
is
not
the
same
situation.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
okay,
and
the
reason
for
that
being
again
the
right
of
the
defendant,
again
going
back
to
the
initial
interview
all
the
way
through
trial,
to
be
able
to
fully
give
all
information,
good
or
bad,
to
the
attorney,
so
that
the
attorney
can
advise
the
defendant
as
to--
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
--those
three
hypotheticals?
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
okay.
because
the
client's
actually
talking
to
the
attorney
regarding
the
client's
involvement
as
to
this
continuing
representation.
it's
something
that's
been
accepted
over
time
as
part
of
the
adversary
system.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
these
other
matters
have
not.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
there
is
a
very
large
distinction
again,
in
terms
of
the
threat
to
the
attorney-client
privilege.
the
first
set
of
admonitions
that
was
given
is
done
consistently
with
an
attorney
and
a
client
basically
still
sharing
the
same
interests,
and
just
like
any
other
type
of
advice
as
to
why--
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
--again,
because
that...
it
is
the
defendant's
right
in
that
sense
that
was--
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
--that's
correct,
and
we're
not
arguing
that.
his
right
to
have
an
attorney--
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
--dedicated
to
the
preservation
of
the
attorney-client
privilege.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
at
the
point
when--
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
--well,
i
suppose
theoretically
he
could
have.
i
think
part
of
the
reason
behind
that
is--
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
--well,
certainly
he
didn't
want...
i
mean,
part
of
the
reason
the
threat
worked
is
he
didn't
want
the
trial
judge
to
know
of
the
particular
problem.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
in
fact,
that's
what
the
attorney
testified
to.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
but
regardless
of
that,
you
know,
i
think
the
point
here
is
that
there
are
certain
interests
within
the
adversary
system
that...
this
court,
for
example
in
the
portash
case,
this
court
held
that
someone
could
not
be
impeached
with
immunized
sworn
testimony
when
that
defendant
wanted
to
get
up
and
give
testimony
which
was
different
from
that.
now,
obviously
the
court
was
finding
in
that
case
that
the
truth-seeking
function
was
subservient
to,
for
example,
one's
right
against
self-incrimination.
and
i
think
that's
what--
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
--because
i
think
essentially...
and
the
curtis
court
in
the
seventh
circuit
recognized
this...
that
the
tactical
reasons
for
trying
to
talk
a
client
out
of
either
testifying
or
what
to
testify
to
is
still
as
decision
of
the
client's
himself,
because
the
right
to
testify
or
the
decision
to
testify,
at
least,
is
personal
right
of
the
defendant.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
certainly
that
would
be.
but
when
it
gets
to
the
point--
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
--well,
the
conflict
is
reached
at
the
point
where
the
client
is
not,
theoretically...
and
again,
in
this
case
we
don't
have
the
record
to
support
that
the
attorney
tried
those
methods...
that
the
client
won't
acquiesce.
and
at
that
point,
and
the
attorney
then
is
going
to
threaten
to
violate
the
attorney-client
privilege,
that's
when
the
conflict
arises.
the
conflict
wouldn't
have
arisen
until
that
point
if
the
attorney
was
simply
trying
tactical
methods
to
talk
a
client
out
of
giving
what
he
believed
to
be
false
testimony.
and
again,
in
this
particular
case
the
lower
courts
did
not
apply
a
standard
which
was
proper
to
even
make
that
determination,
in
which
the
eighth
circuit
assumed
that
in
fact
this
particular
client
was
going
to
testify
falsely
based
on
the
fact
that
simply
the
good
cause
standard
was
supplied
or
a
compelling
support
standard
applied,
when
really
reasonable
doubt
is
the
proper
standard
in
the
sense
that
attorney
as
an
advocate
must
apply
at
least
as
high
a
standard
as
a
jury,
who
are
not
partisans,
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
defendant
is
lying.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
that's
correct.
now,
the
eighth
circuit
believed
that
they
were
precluded
by
sumner
versus
mada
from
making
a
different
fact
finding,
and
the
case
law
indicates
that
they
did
not
have
to
do
that
under
2254
because
the
standards
under
which
an
attorney
has
to
make
that
particular
conclusion
is
really,
at
the
very
least,
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact,
because
besides
just
historical
fact,
the
attorney
has
to
apply
again
the
canon
of
ethics,
he
has
to
apply
the
fact
that
any
doubts
must
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
client,
and
the
fact
that
just
someone
might
give
contradictory
statements
is
clearly
not
enough.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
yes,
i
did.
that
was
the
initial
few
paragraphs
before
i
treated
it
as
if
there
was
a
presumption
that
in
fact
there
was
going
to
be
false
testimony
there.
and
that
is
the
real
key
here,
because
an
improper
evidentiary
standard
was
used.
and
again,
i
think
it's
important
when
one
looks
at
this
case,
however
distasteful
of
course
to
everyone
the
aspect
of
a
client
testifying
falsely
is,
is
the
fact
that
any
rule
that
might
come
out
of
this
case
is
going
to
affect
how
an
attorney
is
going
to
address
his
or
her
client
in
the
initial
client
interview;
that
if
the
attorney
cannot
tell
the
client
that
what
the
client
tells
the
attorney
cannot
be
told
to
anyone
else,
then
in
fact
the
attorney
is
not
going
to
have
the
benefit
of
full
disclosure,
to
be
able,
in
fact,
number
one,
to
dissuade
the
client
if
in
fact
there
is
some
type
of
false
testimony
coming
up;
number
two,
being
able
simply
to
give
the
guiding
hand
of
counsel
that
is
required
by
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
well,
in
terms
of
if...
for
one
thing,
i
think
it's
very
difficult
to
just
tell
a
client
regarding
what,
you
know,
fraud
or
perjury.
you
have
to
explain
things
in
a
little
more
detail
and
a
little
more
plainly.
but
the
fact
is
is
that
how
an
attorney
in
honesty
would
have
to
explain
that
would
deter
a
client
from
being
absolutely
honest,
because
the
client
probably
isn't
going
to
know
what
is
and
what
isn't
going
to
work
against
him.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
well,
that
i
think
is
current
practice
among
the
defense
bar.
now,
if
in
fact
you
give
exceptions
to
the
attorney-client
privilege
and
try
to
explain
them
in
the
initial
interview,
that's
going
to
deter
the
client
from
giving
full
information
to
the
attorney.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
in
this
particular
case,
the
lawyer
under
these
facts
should
have
first
tried
to
dissuade
the
client.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
well,
my
reading
of
the
record
indicate
that
the
client...
that
the
attorney
jumped
straight
to
the
threat
to
disclose,
without
going
through
those
other
steps
of
explaining
to
the
client
what
exactly
would
be
in
store
for
him
in
terms
of
potential
perjury
prosecution,
cross-examination,
and
enhanced
punishment.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
at
that
point,
i
think
the
attorney
at
that
point,
if
all
else
fails
and
withdrawal
is
totally
impractical,
i
think
that
at
that
point
we
have
to
rely
on
the
adversary
system
to
seek
out
the
truth
and
that
they're
going
to
disbelieve
the
client
and
the
client's
the
one
that's
going
to
pay
the
ultimate
price.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
that's
basically
it.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
well,
i
don't
think...
again,
i
don't
think
the
eighth
circuit
necessarily
said
that.
their
limited
holding
is
that--
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
--the
dissent...
that
is
how
the
dissent
characterized
it.
again,
the
narrow
holding
of
the
eighth
circuit--
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
--at
that
point,
the
attorney...
the
system
requires
that
then
at
that
point
the
jury
make
the
decision,
and
the
face
that's
been
placed
on
the
jury
is
that
the
jury
is
going
to
find
the
client
out
and
the
client's
going
to
pay
the
price.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
had
all
those
other
steps
in
the
meantime
been--
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
--well,
the
attorney
could
say,
yes,
i
can
attempt
to
withdraw.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
now,
again--
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
--i
would
agree
that
he
could
go
that
far.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
i
think
there's...
well,
assuming
he
went
through
the
intermediate
steps--
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
--i
would
agree.
i
would
agree
that,
because
all
that
basically
does
is
it
means
the
attorney
has
to
go
to
the
judge
and
the
judge
has
to
let
the
attorney
out.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
i
would
say
not,
again
because
the
attorney-client
privilege
would
extend
beyond
that.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
well,
again,
as
to
the
impact
of
the
attorney-client
privilege,
that's
where
that
exception
has
to
be
made.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
well,
but
the
confidences
of
a
client
are
not
terminated
at
the
time
an
employment
with
the
attorney
ends.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
i
don't
believe
so,
because
that's
not
within
the
scope
of
that
initial
representation.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
that's
correct.
but
again,
as
to
how
it
affects
the
attorney-client
relationship
is
what
makes
the
difference
between
those
particular
cases.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
right.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
in
terms
of...
i
don't
believe
he
can
disclose
that
to
the
judge.
in
other
words--
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
--there's
a
point,
i
suppose,
where
you
have
to
draw
the
line
as
to
what
he's
going
to
disclose
to
the
judge,
what
the
problem
is.
but
again,
what
that
does
is
throws
the
problem
in
the
judge'
lap.
mr.
patrick
reilly
grady
right,
and
again
that
makes
it
less
egregious.
but
again,
of
course,
the
judge
may
be
the
one
that
sentences
the
client
down
the
road.
that
still
is
problematic.
