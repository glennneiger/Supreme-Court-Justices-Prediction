justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
kind
of
a
preliminary
question.
as
i
understand
it,
the
relief
was
granted
on
a
sixth
amendment
theory
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel;
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
least
part
of
it
was?
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
any
sixth
amendment
claim
ever
made
to
the
state
court
as
part
of
the
exhaustion
of
state
remedies?
justice
john
paul
stevens
sort
of
a
due
process
claim,
wasn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you're
satisfied
with
that
ruling?
that's
really
what
i'm
asking.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
maybe
the
trial
judge
was
making
a
record?
for
himself?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
grady,
let
me
follow
up
on
a
question
that
the
chief
justice
asked
your
opponent.
supposing
the
client
had
told
the
lawyer
that
he
was
going
to
kill
a
witness,
a
prosecuting
witness,
and
the
lawyer
said
to
him:
if
you
do,
i
will
tell
the
judge
what
you've
done
and
i
will
withdraw.
now,
would
that
be
unethical?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
why
is
it
different?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
i
am
assuming
a
case
in
which
the
client
has
given
his
version
of
what
happened
and
then,
having
given
the
version,
says,
yes,
but
i'm
going
to
testify
differently,
and
what
i
testify
to
will
be
false.
i'm
assuming
an
easy
case
where
we
know
he's
testifying
falsely.
then
why
is
it
different?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
this
case,
as
i
understand
your
position,
really
the
heart
of
your
argument
is
there's
a
conflict
between
the
lawyer
and
the
client,
that
they
have
a
different...
that
the
lawyer
is
not
pursuing
the
client's
interests.
but
what
if
the
lawyer
thinks
that
perjury
would
be
a
tactical
mistake
and
more
likely
to
result
in
conviction
than
if
he
told
the
truth,
and
therefore
everything
he
did
was
justified
by
his
interest
in
acquitting
the
client?
how
do
you
find
a
conflict
of
interest
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
decision
to
testify.
but
in
the
fact
pattern
we
have,
where
he's
going
to
testify
and
it's
just
a
question
of
what
he's
going
to
say,
and
the
lawyer
sincerely
and
effectively
urges
him
to
tell
the
truth
because
he
thinks
it's
going
to
be
more
persuasive
than
introducing
a
falsehood
into
the
story
and
maybe
looking
very
bad
on
the
witness
stand,
wouldn't
that
be
in
the
client's
best
interests?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
where's
the
conflict?
