mr.
james
d.
crawford
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
filed
a
reply
brief
in
support
of
the
petition
of
certiorari
for
robert
davidson
because
i
anticipated
two
questions
that
this
court
might
address
in
the
daniels
case.
i
asked
that
the
cases
be
set
down
together.
the
court
saw
fit
to
do
so.
those
two
questions
were
the
question
of
damages
which
might
happen
in
some
non-prison
context,
damages
common
to
the
non-prison
context,
and
the
question
of
whether
the
immunity
was
clear.
what
makes
the
davidson
case
a
good
solution
or
a
good
vehicle
for
the
court
to
solve
those
questions
is
that
robert
davidson
was
injured
when
prison
officials
negligently
failed
to
look
into
his
suggestion
that
another
prisoner
was
going
to
attack
him.
the
prisoner
did,
indeed,
attack
him
and
injured
him
seriously,
plainly
a
prison
negligent
situation
not
otherwise
common.
it
is
also
clear
that
in
new
jersey
there
is
simply
no
liability
whatever
when...
to
either
a
public
entity
or
an
official
for
an
injury
caused
to
one
prisoner
by
another.
that
would
also
be
true,
one
inmate
of
a
psychiatric
institution
to
another,
that
sort
of
situation.
accordingly,
although
i
think
that
the
daniels
case
and
the
argument
which
you
have
heard
in
it
solves
the
problems
that
face
me
and
that
perhaps
this
argument
was
unnecessary,
i
do
want
to
address
those
issues
and
some
other
related
issues
which
make
this
case
a
clear
case
in
which
the
rules
which
this
court
announced,
i
thought
with
unquestioned
clarity
in
parratt
versus
taylor
and
in
palmer
versus
hudson,
apply
here.
indeed,
i
am
intrigued
with
the
theory
that
somehow
losing
a
hobby
kit
or
stealing
a
couple
of
papers
from
a
prisoner's
cell
plainly
implicates
the
fourteenth
amendment.
there
is
a
deprivation
of
property
there,
but
when
a
prisoner's
face
is
repeatedly
gouged
with
a
fork
so
that
the
prisoner
suffers
damages
which
judge
brotman
thought
could
be
compensated
at
$2,000
and
which
i
am
sure
that
is
minimal
compensation,
that
that
is
not
a
deprivation
of
liberty
interest.
i
am
intrigued
particularly
by
justice
stevens'
question
as
to
whether
we
are
talking
about
substantive
or
procedural
due
process.
and,
i
believe
we
are
talking
procedural
due
process
but
in
a
peculiar
sense.
i
think
that
prisoners,
because
of
their
circumstance,
perhaps
have
a
substantive
right
to
procedural
due
process
that
is
meaningful.
and,
i
say
that
because
you
work
from
a
situation
in
which
the
prisoner
has
a
right,
not
just
from
south
v.
maryland,
but
from
english
and
american
cases
stretching
back
well
before
the
constitution
and
coming
forth
in
cases
like
youngberg
versus
romeo,
where
you
recognize
that
people
in
custody
simply
are
dependent
upon
their
custodians,
and
because
a
prisoner
at
least,
probably
someone
in
a
sheriff's
care
or
in
a
psychiatric
or
institution
for
the
retarded,
can't
do
the
things
the
rest
of
us
do
to
protect
ourselves
from
attacks
by
other
prisoners.
i
assume...
the
first
thing
i
do
is
i
run.
maybe
before
i
run
i
went
out
and
i
bought
insurance
to
protect
me
from
various
things
that
might
threaten
me.
if
i
felt
it
was
wise
to
do
so,
i
might
buy
a
weapon.
i
suppose
i
could
hire
a
guard.
i
could
certainly
fight
back
and
nobody
is
going
to
say
to
me
you
are
one
of
two
prisoners
who
is
going
to
be
put
in
solitary
confinement
for
fighting.
so,
there
are
a
lot
of
things
that
i
do
or
you
do
or
anyone
in
this
courtroom
does
to
protect
against
threats
of
attack
from
others.
they
are
not
open
to
prisoners.
and,
for
that
reason,
it
is
clear
that,
just
as
the
state
must
make
some
kind
of
a
meaningful
remedy
available
for
lost
hobby
kits
that
come
through
the
mail,
that
the
state
certainly
must
have
some
sort
of
a
procedure
that
says
when
prison
authorities
are
warned
that
one
prisoner
is
going
to
attack
another
prisoner
and
they
forget
to
do
anything
about
it,
the
prisoner
can
look
to
relief
from
the
court
system.
normally
what
you
do,
and
i
think
the
civilized...
that
is
unfair
to
new
jersey.
what
you
would
do
in
those
states
which
do
not
have
extreme
sovereign
immunity
doctrines,
states
which
haven't
done
what
new
jersey
did,
and
judge
gibbons,
an
opinion
that
is
full
of
learned
language
and
obscure
ideas,
says
what
is
peculiar
to
the
new
jersey
sovereign
immunity
statute
is
that
it
is
introduced
with
a
clause
that
says
you
can't
give
the
state
a
duty
to
do
everything.
sovereign
immunity
isn't
here
because
we
are
going
to
absolve
the
state
from
liability.
in
new
jersey
peculiarly
we
actually
absolve
the
state
from
duties.
and,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
fourteenth
amendment
did
nothing
else,
it
gave
the
state
a
duty
to
protect
life,
liberty,
and
property
and
says
that
a
state
cannot
deprive
anyone
of
those
without
due
process
of
law.
and,
when
new
jersey
decided
to
take
that
duty
away,
it
seems
to
me
they
did
it
in
an
unconstitutional
statute.
the
solicitor
general
makes
much
of
the
fact
that
my
client,
who
was
filling
out
a
form...
and
this
court
has
seen
plenty
of
the
forms
that
come
up
through
the
prison
system...
filling
out
the
form
of
complaint
when
he
wanted
relief,
didn't
say
he
wanted
the
statute
held
unconstitutional.
so,
plainly
he
was
satisfied
with
the
statute.
he
said,
i
have
been
injured
and
i
want
relief
which
i
can't
get
elsewhere,
so
please
give
me
that
relief
and
whatever
other
relief
is
appropriate
to
me.
i
suppose
appropriate
relief
might
well
have
been
to
strike
down
the
statute.
i
did
not
think
it
was
necessary
when
i
argued
this
case
in
the
third
circuit
and
i
am
the
first
lawyer
that
my
client
got
to
see.
i
thought
that
parratt
versus
taylor
made
it
very
clear
that
you
could
have
that
kind
of
a
statute,
but
you
couldn't
take
away
relief
from
the
prisoner
who
brought
a
case
to
redress
that
deprivation.
if
i
have
erred,
i
suppose
the
case
should
go
back
down
for
a
determination
as
to
whether
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
that
seems
to
me
an
inappropriate
way
to
use
the
court's
time
now
when
the
question
framed
repeatedly
on
whether
negligence
can
give
rise
to
a
1983
action
is
here
and
is
here
under
exactly
those
circumstances
which
allow
it
to
be
decided
once
and
for
all.
the
deprivation
question
which
troubled
justice
o'connor
at
the
beginning
of
the
preceding
argument,
it
seems
to
me,
could
come
down
either
way
if
you
were
construing
language.
i
would
assume
if
the
state
were
building
a
highway
across
the
back
of
my
property
and
the
engineer
designed
it
properly
and
said
i
am
going
to
have
to
take
the
back
two
acres...
i
don't
have
two
acres...
but
assume
a
large
property
to
go
with
it...
going
to
have
to
take
the
back
two
acres,
the
state
would
compensate
me.
if
they,
on
the
other
hand,
had
hired
an
engineer
who
said
i
can
save
you
a
lot
of
money,
i
will
design
you
a
cheaper
highway,
and
he
only
took
one
acre
off
the
back
of
my
property,
i
am
compensated
for
that.
then
the
fill
is
put
in
and,
of
course,
the
first
rain
storm
it
flows
over
the
additional
acre,
because
he
negligently
has
designed
a
highway
that
takes
two
acres
of
my
property
and
pretended
it
was
a
one-acre
piece
of
property
that
needed
to
be
taken.
that
would
be
a
taking
and
i
would
go
to
court
and
i
would
get
compensation
because
the
property
was
negligently
taken.
mr.
james
d.
crawford
i
suppose,
justice
o'connor...
i
can't
say
and
i
wouldn't
say
that
the
prison
authorities
here
intended
that
robert
davidson
have
his
face
chopped
up
with
at
work.
but,
i
think
that
their
duty
toward
davidson
says
that
if
they
aren't
careful
of
him
in
a
prison
situation,
that
they
have
deprived
him
of
rights,
because
the
only
way
somebody
locked
up
with
a
bunch
of
prisoners,
many
of
them
violent,
can
have
any
liberty
at
all
is
if
the
prison
authorities
undertake
what
i
think
is
their
clear
duty
of
protection
and
that
is
a
common
law
duty
that
is
in
state
law,
it
is
in
federal
law,
it
antidotes
swift
versus
tyson,
it
antidotes
both
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
and,
for
that
reason,
i
would
say
here
there
is
a
deprivation.
this
is
why
i,
like
mr.
saltzburg,
don't
see
1983
action
showing
up
when
police
officers
drive
down
the
streets,
or
as
i
was
asked
in
the
course
of
the
oral
argument
in
this
case--
mr.
james
d.
crawford
--i
limit
it
to
the
prison
setting
because
it
seems
to
me
we
can
find
a
clear
duty
here
that
is
much
more
easily
defined
than
you
find
in
the
general
driving
on
the
streets.
how
the
body
politic
deals
with
the
question
of
whether
private
citizens
hit
by
police
cars
or
ambulances
are
going
to
be
compensated.
it
works
in
that
whole
political
system
we
have.
the
people
who
are
walking
the
streets
vote,
they
are
also
taxpayers,
and
they
make
decisions
with
their
government
as
to
what
is
going
to
go
on
about
compensating
ambulance
accidents.
you
don't
need
a
federal
court
action
there.
i
don't
think
it
would
foreclose
one,
but
you
certainly
don't
need
one,
and
you
can
distinguish
it.
yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
james
d.
crawford
i
think
it
is
a
federal
law
duty,
justice
stevens.
it
seems
to
me--
mr.
james
d.
crawford
--i
think
the
due
process...
that
is
why
i
conclude
that
there
is
some
piece
of
substance
involved
here.
while
i
think
procedure
is
all
that
you
have
to
do
for
the
prisoner--
mr.
james
d.
crawford
--i
see
no
reason
to
find
a
cause
of
action
for
the
visitor
and
the
case
that
is
before
the
court
and
the
question
that
should
be
answered
is
the
question
of
the
inmate.
should
the
court
feel
generous
to
the
protection
of
the
visitor,
i
can't
argue
with
it,
but
i
don't
think
the
rationale
which
gives
robert
davidson
his
right
needs
to
apply
to
a
visitor.
mr.
james
d.
crawford
no,
justice
stevens.
i
think...
we
found
this
in
hudson.
even
where
there
is
intention,
as
there
was
in
hudson,
or
i
think
special
duties
to
protect
the
rights
of
a
prisoner,
as
there
is
in
the
two
cases
before
the
court
today,
the
availability
of
a
due
process
remedy
after
the
act
is
sufficient
recompense,
so
the
immunity
does
become
crucial
to
this.
these
are
the
random
occurrences
which
really
can't
be
handled
by
a
pre-deprivation
remedy.
normally
you
don't
take
things
without
due
process
in
advance.
but,
all
three
of
the
cases,
the
two
cases
today
and
the--
mr.
james
d.
crawford
--i
think
that
is
correct,
justice
stevens.
mr.
james
d.
crawford
the
state
has
deprived
the
person
of
liberty--
mr.
james
d.
crawford
--yes,
through
negligence.
mr.
james
d.
crawford
that
is
correct,
justice
white.
mr.
james
d.
crawford
and
without
any
remedy
for
it.
mr.
james
d.
crawford
there
is
a
deprivation,
but
not
a
constitutional
deprivation
as
i
read
the
fourteenth
amendment.
what
is
prohibited
is
deprivation
without
due
process.
you
can
take
the
two
acres
off
the
back
of
my
property.
you
can
take
my
life,
as
this
court
has
held,
either
under
a
sentence
of
death
or
under
certain
circumstances
where
accidental
death
is
caused.
you
can
do
it,
but
there
must
be
due
process,
and
that
is
what
is
lacking
here.
i
think
the
court
has
heard
in
the
previous
argument
the
basic
framework
of
this
argument
and
i
won't
go
on
further.
i
may
address
some
questions
at
the
end
of
the
argument
for
my
opponents.
otherwise,
i
will
not
take
further
time.
mr.
james
d.
crawford
four
very
brief
points
which
i
would
like
to
make.
first,
the
solicitor
general's
parade
of
horrors,
the
awful
things
that
are
going
to
happen
if
this
case
is
decided
in
favor
of
mr.
davidson
or
if
the
case
before
is
decided
in
favor
of
mr.
daniels,
that
is
so
only
if
you
give
us
a
great
deal
more
than
we
ask
for.
we
were
careful
in
our
requests
and
i
trust
this
court
to
be
even
more
careful
in
its
opinion.
secondly,
a
prisoner
does
not
have
a
right
to
safety.
a
prisoner
has
a
right
to
care.
a
prisoner
doesn't
have
a
right
not
to
be
lynched
by
a
lynch
mob,
he
has
a
right
to
be
protected
from
a
lynch
mob
to
the
best
of
a
sheriff's
ability.
he
doesn't
have
a
right
not
to
be
struck
by
a
fellow
prisoner,
he
has
a
right
to
be
protected.
mr.
james
d.
crawford
no.
i
think
a
negligent
act
can
still
give
cause...
can
be
a
deprivation
but
the
mere
failure
of
even
a
careful
jailer
to
protect
his
prisoner
plainly
gives
you
no
relief
and
mrs.
mansier's
suggestion
that
you
have
a
right
to
safety
is
simply
untrue.
you
have
a
right
to
care.
third,
the
distinction
between
the
eighth
amendment
in
smith
and
wade
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
here
is
that
in
smith
and
wade
had
there
been
any
amount
of
state
process
it
wouldn't
have
helped.
the
question
is
do
you
have
a
right
to
some
kind
of
process
when
you
have
a
negligent
deprivation.
we
suggest
finally
that
if
immunity
is
read
as
the
solicitor
general
and
mrs.
mansier
would
have
it
read,
that
the
great
promise
of
parratt,
criticized
by
many
as
taking
away
the
right
to
sue
directly
without
turning
to
state
rights,
that
the
promise
was
that
the
states
would
get
back
to
doing
the
states'
business,
the
federal
courts
would
do
their
business,
that
promise
is
taken
away
if
the
states
can
do
their
business
by
saying
we
will
pass
an
immunity
statute
and
then
nobody
can
help
the
prisoner.
i
don't
think
this
court
meant
it
and
i
trust
it
will
not
now.
