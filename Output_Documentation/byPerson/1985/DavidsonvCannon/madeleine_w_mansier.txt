ms.
madeleine
w.
mansier
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner
here
suffered
physical
injury
as
a
result
of
a
deliberate
act
by
a
third
party.
he
now
makes
a
two-part
argument
here
in
order
to
assess
liability
against
the
state
under
section
1983.
he
argues
first
that
because
respondents'
negligence
was
in
some
tort
sense
law
way,
causally
related
to
that
physical
injury;
that,
therefore,
the
state
has
deprived
the
petitioner
of
liberty.
the
second
part
of
his
argument
is
that
that
deprivation
was
without
due
process
simply
because
the
new
jersey
state
legislature
made
a
decision
to
immunize
negligent
conduct
for
inner-prisoner
injury.
respondents
urge
this
court
to
reject
both
parts
of
that
argument.
while
it
is
necessary
for
this
court
to
reject
only
one,
either
one
of
those
parts,
and
still
affirm
the
judgment
in
favor
of
the
respondents
by
the
third
circuit,
we
would
urge
this
court
to
send
out
a
clear
message
that,
first
of
all,
negligence
does
not
equal
a
deprivation
within
the
meaning
of
the
due
process
clause,
and,
secondly,
even
when
their
is
a
deprivation
because
the
conduct
has
been
worse
than
negligent,
that
there
is
not
a
deprival
of
due
process
simply
because
of
the
existence
of
an
immunity.
there
is
no
such
per
se
rule.
i
would
like
to
begin
with
the
first
of
those
two
issues,
namely,
the
question
of
whether
negligence
equals
a
deprivation.
justice
o'connor
has
asked
on
a
couple
of
occasions
now
about
this
very
question;
that
is
it
seems
to
me
that
behind
the
question
is
does
deprivation
mean
simply
some
kind
of
causal
relationship
or
does
it
mean
more
than
that?
respondents
would
suggest
that
it
means
far
more
than
that.
we
would
adopt
the
definition
that
was
given
by
justice
powell
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
parratt
versus
taylor;
namely,
that
deprivation
means
some
kind
of
an
intentional
act
to
deny
something
to
somebody
or
a
deliberate
decision
to
not
act
to
prevent
a
loss.
ms.
madeleine
w.
mansier
justice
rehnquist,
i
do
not
think
that
the
court
rejected
it
in
the
specific
sense
that
it
was
a
part
of
the
holding
of
the
case
in
parratt
versus
taylor.
respondents
are
well
aware
that
there
is
language
in
parratt
versus
taylor
to
the
effect
that
the
alleged
loss,
though
negligently
caused,
amounted
to
a
deprivation.
however,
that
language
was
not
crucial
to
or
a
fundamental
part
of
the
holding
in
that
case.
and,
respondents
say
that
for
this
reason.
the
court
in
parratt
versus
taylor
framed
the
issue
as
to
whether
negligence
would
support
a
claim
for
relief
under
section
1983.
the
answer
was
no
in
that
case
and
rightly
so,
because
what
the
court
saw
there
was
what
taylor
had
conceded
from
the
outside
which
was
that
there
was
a
state
remedy.
he
had
simply
chosen
not
to
go
into
state
court.
there
was
a
state
remedy.
nebraska
took
care
of
that
and
as
a
result
of
that,
even
if
there
had
been
a
deprivation,
even
if
all
of
the
prerequisites
for
a
due
process
claim
had
been
made,
there
still
would
not
have
been
a
deprivation
without
due
process
and,
therefore,
no
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
ms.
madeleine
w.
mansier
that
is--
ms.
madeleine
w.
mansier
--justice
stevens,
i
do
not
envision
any
execution
as
a
negligent
act.
there
may
have
been
a
mistake.
ms.
madeleine
w.
mansier
there
may
be
a
mistake
as,
indeed,
there
was
a
mistake
in
baker
versus
mccollan,
and
there
this
court
found
there
wasn't
even
a
right
in
the
first
instance.
ms.
madeleine
w.
mansier
that
is
correct,
because
they
did
even
need
to
reach
that
point.
what
they
found
instead
was
that
there
was
no
right--
ms.
madeleine
w.
mansier
--because
here
we
are
dealing
with
the
due
process
clause
and
the
due
process
clause
has
the
specific
language
of
the
word
"deprive".
and,
the
primary
issue
before
this
court,
at
least
initially,
is
what
does
deprive
mean.
ms.
madeleine
w.
mansier
that
is--
ms.
madeleine
w.
mansier
--that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor.
ms.
madeleine
w.
mansier
that
is
correct.
and,
it
was
never
contemplated
here
in
this
case
that
davidson
would
be
injured.
and,
in
further
response
to
your
question,
justice
stevens,
if
this
court
could
go
further
and
declare
that
even
outside
the
due
process
clause,
even
if
there
were
a
claim
under
the
first
amendment,
a
claim
under
the
fourth
amendment,
that
nevertheless
there
could
not
be
a
remedy
provided
by
1983
even
for
negligent
conduct,
simply
because
section
1983
is
designed
to
deal
with
official
abuse
of
power.
but,
what
we
are
saying
in
this
case
is
that
this
court
need
not
go
that
far
if
it
does
not
want
to.
it
can
limit
its
analysis
to
due
process
claims
which
is
the
precise
claim
being
made
here
and
then
one
needs
to
focus
on
the
language
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
that
language
has
the
word
"deprive"
in
it.
and,
what
respondents
say
is
that
negligence
never
amounts
to
a
deprivation
because
it
is
not
this
intentional
act,
it
is
not
deliberately
doing
something.
it
is
the
very
antithesis
of
the
whole
purpose
of
the
due
process
clause
from
the
outset.
that
was
designed
to
deal
with
petty
tyranny,
to
deal
with
oppression,
to
deal
with
situations
in
which
the
government
would
go
through
the
streets
and
take
people
off
the
streets
and
put
them
into
prison
and
take
away
their
liberty
in
that
sense.
and,
even
there
the
government
has
the
right
to
do
that
providing
it
provides
due
process.
but,
the
due
process
clause
has
always
been
meant
to
deal
with
intentional
acts,
with
something
far
more
than
simply
negligence.
and,
both
this
petitioner
and
the
petitioner
in
the
other
case
argue
that
if
negligence
can
ever
be
a
deprivation
within
the
due
process
clause,
it
surely
can
here.
petitioners
have
that
argument
backwards.
people
who
go
into
prison
don't
gain
rights.
they
may
not
lose
all
of
their
rights
as
we
well
know,
but
they
don't
gain
new
ones.
instead,
they
retain,
as
this
court
said
in
hudson
versus
palmer,
those
rights
which
are
consistent
and
compatible
with
incarceration.
in
hudson,
this
court
found
that
the
right
to
privacy
within
one's
cell
was
not
compatible
with
incarceration.
respondents
would
urge
here
that
the
right
being
asserted
by
the
petitioner
is
the
right
to
safety.
specifically,
they
are
urging,
although
perhaps
not
articulating,
the
right
to
absolute
safety.
respondents
say
that
the
right
to
absolute
safety
in
a
prison
setting
is
not
compatible
with
incarceration.
yes,
we
have
a
duty
to
protect.
yes,
we
have
a
duty
to
exercise
some
reasonable
care
and
it
is
only
because
we
breach
that
duty
that
we
were
found
to
be
negligent.
but,
the
breaching
of
the
duty
is
simply
a
question
as
to
whether
we
were
negligent
in
the
first
instance.
it
does
not
go
to
separating
out
prisoners
from
everybody
else
in
the
world
with
reference
to
what
the
due
process
clause
protects
them
against.
ms.
madeleine
w.
mansier
it
is
true,
justice
stevens,
that
the
immunity
that
is
the
focal
point
here
does
deal
with
injuries
caused
by
one
prisoner
to
another
prisoner.
new
jersey
law
does
also
immunize
situations
in
which
injury
is
caused
by
an
escaping
or
an
escaped
prisoner.
if
a
visitor
comes
into
the
prison
and
that
person
is
injured
by
a
prisoner,
then,
yes,
it
is
true
that
that
person
would
not
come
within
this
immunity
and,
therefore,
would
have
the
right
to
sue
under
new
jersey
law.
and,
that
question
of
separating
out
will
get
to
the
issue
that
i
would
like
to
deal
with
in
a
moment,
which
is
the
question
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
immunity
and
the
question
of
whether
immunity
automatically
and
necessarily
means
that
there
is
no
due
process.
ms.
madeleine
w.
mansier
we
are
giving
the
prisoner
fewer
rights
with
reference
to
injuries
caused
by
other
prisoners
in
the
sense
that
for
that
plaintiff
there
is
immunity.
the
answer
is
yes,
justice
blackmun.
ms.
madeleine
w.
mansier
that
is
certainly
one
way
of
articulating
it.
i
think
the
rationale
behind
it
is
set
forth
in
the
commentary
that
goes
with
that
statute
and
i
would
like
to
reach
that.
but,
with
reference
to
this
question
of
whether
duty
goes
simply
to
negligence
or
goes
to
something
more,
since
the
petitioner
is
really
saying
that
he
has
a
right
to
safety,
that
is
precisely
the
claim
made
by
the
prisoner
in
smith
versus
wade.
in
that
case,
the
court
found...
this
court
specifically
said
that
if
the
prison
guard
had
been
simply
negligent,
that
there
would
not
be
any
cause
of
action
there
because
of
the
need
to
protect
prison
guards
in
their
day-to-day
decisions
in
running
a
correctional
institution.
in
smith
versus
wade,
as
it
turned
out,
the
conduct
of
the
prison
guard
was
worse
than
merely
negligent.
it
was
deliberately
indifferent.
he
knew
or
should
have
know
what
was
going
to
happen.
and,
in
that
instance,
this
court
recognized
the
cause
of
action
and
rightly
so.
smith
versus
wade
was
analyzed
under
the
eighth
amendment.
this
court
ought
not
to
take
the
very
same
claim
of
a
right
to
safety
against
injury
by
another
prisoner,
analyze
it
under
a
different
constitutional
portion
as
the
due
process
clause
and
apply
some
lesser
standard
as
the
petitioner
would
have
them
do
of
mere
negligence.
that
would
not
be
consistent.
it
is
the
same
claim,
it
is
the
same
argument.
the
same
standard
ought
to
be
applied.
so,
while
respondents
say
that
negligence
can
never
equal
deprivation,
respondents
say
it
surely
cannot
here.
the
test
ought
to
be
at
least
deliberate
indifference.
turning
our
attention
to--
ms.
madeleine
w.
mansier
--we
are
focusing
here
on
negligence
not
being
a
deprivation
within
the
meaning
of
the
due
process
clause?
ms.
madeleine
w.
mansier
and,
we
are
talking
about
a
negligent
taking
of
life,
liberty,
or
property.
ms.
madeleine
w.
mansier
if
a
prison
guard
acts
intentionally--
ms.
madeleine
w.
mansier
--and
as
a
result
of
that
a
prisoner
is
injured
if
we
are
sticking
with
the
kind
of
case
that
we
have
here,
then
that
is
an
entirely
different
case
and
we
would
say
that
an
intentional
act
does
equal
a
deprivation.
ms.
madeleine
w.
mansier
justice
o'connor,
we
realize
that
courts
have
historically
found
difficulty
in
dealing
with
exactly
where
the
lines
are
between
different
standards
of
conduct.
that
is
especially
true
between
negligence
and
gross
negligence,
perhaps
in
part
because
of
the
fact
that
the
word
"negligence"
appeals
in
both.
we
would
urge
this
court
to
take
the
position
that
even
gross
negligence,
assuming
one
can
define
that
as
being
some
kind
of
negligence
but
something
worse
than
the
negligence
that
occurred
here,
would
still
not
equal
a
deprivation
within
the
meaning
of
the
due
process
clause,
primarily
because
we
go
back
to
the
position
that
deprivation
is
some
kind
of
an
intentional
act,
and
intentional
and
negligence
are
different
qualitatively
regardless
of
whether
we
are
talking
about
simple
negligence
or
gross
negligence.
ms.
madeleine
w.
mansier
that
is
correct,
it
does
not
under
estelle.
ms.
madeleine
w.
mansier
that
is
an
eighth
amendment
case
and
the
determination
was
made--
ms.
madeleine
w.
mansier
--justice
white,
that
is,
indeed,
what
i
would
have
called
here
the
third
argument.
ms.
madeleine
w.
mansier
that
is...
but,
i
am
perfectly
willing
to
reach
it
now
and
to
skip
over
for
the
moment
again
the
argument
of
whether
immunity
can...
automatically
means
that
there
is
no
due
process.
petitioners
really
believe
here
and
have
argued
from
the
outset
that
there
is
no
liberty
interest
in
the
first
instance.
the
cases
that
are
relied
on
by
the
petitioner
and
that
were
relied
on,
indeed,
by
the
third
circuit,
which
admittedly
found
there
was
a
liberty
interest,
are
completely
wrong.
they
are
inapplicable.
they
were
rightly
decided,
but
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
one
is
ingraham
versus
wright.
that
stands
for
the
proposition
that
the
government
can't
hold
somebody
and
punish
them.
we
agree
with
that,
but
that
is
not
what
happened
here.
the
second
is
youngberg
versus
romeo.
there
the
court
found
that
an
involuntarily
committed
person
had
a
liberty
interest
in
safety
but
that
liberty
interest
was
in
being
free
from
injury
63
times
over
a
two-year
period.
but,
in
both
of
those
cases
this
court
said
if
the
plaintiff
had
been
a
prisoner,
then
the
question
would
have
been
whether
it
was
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
because
that
was
the
issue
that
was
presented
and
the
court
rejected
it
because
the
plaintiffs
were
not
prisoners.
here,
the
plaintiff
is
a
prisoner
and
respondents
would
urge
that
the
only
right
to
safety
they
have
is
a
right
to
be
free
from
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
and
if
it
doesn't
reach
that
level,
there
is
no
interest
in
safety
that
is
recognized.
finally,
on
the
issue
of
the
immunities,
if
this
court
were
to
determine
that
immunities
are
always...
automatically
means
that
there
is
no
due
process,
you
will
negate
tort
immunity,
you
will
call
them
all
into
question.
you
may
even
call
into
question
the
judicially
created
immunities.
you
will
deprive
states
of
the
right
to
fashion
their
own
tort
laws
to
the
right
expressly
recognized
in
martinez
versus
california,
providing
that
that
statute
is
rationale,
is
not
arbitrary,
and
in
this
case
this
statute
is,
indeed,
rational.
it
is,
in
fact,
a
portion
of
the
very
same
statute
that
was
in
martinez.
and,
in
addition
to
that,
the
new
jersey
courts
have...
the
legislature
has
indicated
that
they
recognized
the
practical
problems
inherent
in
supervising
prisoners
and
in
particular
in
preventing
injuries
caused
by
one
prisoner
upon
another.
they
realized
the
problems
in
that.
so,
the
decision
that
they
have
made
is
that
if
you
are
merely
negligent,
then
you
will
not
be
liable.
however,
there
is
another
provision
in
the
same
act
that
says
if
your
act
is
willful
misconduct,
actual
crime,
actual
fraud,
actual
malice,
if
it
is
any
of
those,
no
immunity
applies.
and,
basically
what
new
jersey
legislature
has
done
is
that
we
recognize
that
negligence
doesn't
equal
a
deprivation.
it
is
perfectly
proper
to
pass
this
kind
of
a
statute.
but,
if
the
conduct
gets
so
bad
that
it
is
willful
misconduct,
we
will
not
protect
those
people,
we
will
not
provide
them
with
any
immunity.
so,
in
conclusion,
we
urge
this
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
third
circuit,
either
by
finding
that
there
was
no
liberty
interest
in
the
first
place
because
the
eighth
amendment
claim
was
rejected,
or
if
there
was
a
liberty
interest,
that
the
negligent
conduct
here
did
not
amount
to
a
deprivation
within
the
meaning
of
the
due
process
clause.
and,
finally,
that
the
petitioner
is
also
wrong
in
saying
that
the
existence
of
the
immunity
automatically
means
that
there
is
no
due
process.
thank
you.
