mr.
charles
fried
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
i
may,
before
i
enter
the
details
of
what
we
consider
to
be
the
defects
in
petitioner's
claim,
may
i
suggest
a
more
distant
perspective
on
this
case?
a
hundred
years
ago,
oliver
wendell
holmes
began
the
common
law
by
insisting
on
a
distinction
which
he
said
was
so
basic
that
it
is
part
between
being
stumbled
over
and
being
kicked.
in
this
case,
respondent
can
at
most
be
said
to
have
stumbled.
if
anyone
kicked
petitioner,
it
was
his
fellow
prisoner,
mcmillian,
against
whom,
of
course,
davidson
retains
a
cause
of
action.
the
majestic
purpose
of
the
due
process
clause,
we
suggest,
is
trivialized
for
it
was
intended
to
protect
against
oppression
and
there
is
no
oppression
here
where
a
state
officer
has
at
most
stumbled
whether
or
not
the
state
offers
a
complete
remedy
for
the
harm
which
is
occasioned
by
that
stumbling.
now,
turning
to
the
details,
petitioner
claims
there
is
a
denial
of
procedural
due
process
and
i
think
we
should
try
to
keep
distinct
whether
the
claim
is
a
procedural
or
a
substantive
one.
petitioner
claimed,
or
at
least
so
it
seemed
from
the
papers,
claimed
there
is
a
denial
of
procedural
due
process
because
of
the
existence
of
the
state
immunity.
if
that
argument
is
correct,
then
every
state
limitation
on
liability,
every
gap
in
the
complete
garment
of
compensation
gives
rise
to
a
due
process
violation,
including
such
familiar
limitations
on
liability
as
automobile
guest
statutes,
no
fault
statutes.
more
remarkably
still
petitioner's
argument
would
put
under
a
constitutional
doubt
limitations
on
liabilities,
gaps
in
liabilities
which
have
been
established
by
this
court
itself.
and,
i
think
most
strikingly
of
chapel
and
wallace
in
which
this
court
said
that
there
is
ground
for
grave
hesitation
before
allowing
a
soldier
to
bring
a
cause
of
action
against
a
military
superior
and
denied
the
claim.
and,
i
think
some
of
the
reasoning
in
chapel
and
wallace,
some
of
the
balancing
of
interest
there
is
very
similar
to
the
balancing
of
interest
which
occasioned
the
new
jersey
legislature
to
find
immunity
here.
it
is
our
suggestion
that
that
process
of
establishing
an
immunity
where
there
seems
to
be
good
reasons
for
doing
so
cannot
of
itself
create
a
procedural
due
process
claim.
mr.
charles
fried
that
point
was
emphasized,
particularly
in
argument,
although
i
must
say
the
eighth
amendment
aspect
was
not
emphasized
as
the
case
was
litigated
so
far.
we
would
suggest
that
the
status
of
petitioners
here
as
prisoners
is
constitutionally
irrelevant.
they
have
treated
as
simply
part
of
the
factual
setting
which
gives
rise
to
a
duty
of
care
and
a
possible
claim
of
negligence.
in
this
respect,
they
are
like
a
pedestrian,
also
involuntarily
in
the
path
of
a
negligently
driven
automobile,
also
involuntarily,
and
the
failure
to
heed
poor
driving
conditions
are
part
of
the
factual
setting.
the
failure
to--
mr.
charles
fried
--no,
he
did
not.
mr.
charles
fried
no,
he
did
not.
mr.
charles
fried
he
is
not
there--
mr.
charles
fried
--the
man
in
the
street
struck
by
the
automobile
also
does
not
voluntarily
choose
to
be
in
the
path
of
a--
mr.
charles
fried
--yes,
he
did.
mr.
charles
fried
he
made
no
choice.
mr.
charles
fried
no,
he
did
not.
mr.
charles
fried
with
respect,
justice
marshall,
that
difference
is
important
insofar
as
it
creates
a
duty
of
care
and
the
duty
of
care
then
is
the
predicate
for
the
negligence
action.
i
don't
understand
petitioners
to
be
claiming
here
that
their
eighth
amendment
rights
were
violated
as
they
were
in
youngberg
and
romeo.
they
don't
make
that
claim.
turning
to
the
deprivation
point,
we
suggest
no
more
than
that
the
court
read
the
word
"deprive"
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
conceptually
parallel
to
its
constitutional
neighbor's
"deny"
in
the
denial
of
equal
protection
and
"take"
in
the
taking
of
property.
those
terms
have
clearly
been
focused
on
intentional
actions
and
all
three
of
those
terms,
of
course,
are
intended
to
guarantee
against
oppression
by
the
state
and
that
oppression--
mr.
charles
fried
--but,
we
hope
that
it
is
clear
now
and
that--
mr.
charles
fried
--yet
as
clear
as
it
is
now
it
is
clear
because
oppression
comes
when
there
is
some
deliberate...
some
systematic
invasion
of
right
which
is
what
we
say
is
missing
here.
now,
much
is
made
of
the
decision
of
the
parratt
case.
we
would
suggest
that
parratt
is
best
viewed
as
a
case
in
which
this
court
has
established--
mr.
charles
fried
--in
parratt
what
this
court
did
was
establish
those
conditions
which
are
sufficient
to
deprive
a
person
of
a
due
process
claim.
but,
i
don't
think
parratt
needs
to
be
read
as
saying
what
is
necessary
in
order
to
satisfy
due
process.
it
is
simply
what
is
sufficient
to
satisfy
due
process.
and,
i
say
that
because
i
think
of
the
context
of
many,
many
other
decisions
in
this
court.
i
think
particularly
of
paul
v.
davis
and
baker
against
mccollan,
which
suggests
that
the
due
process
clause
cannot
be
allowed
to
turn
into
a
font
of
residual
tort
liability
which
i
think
is
what
would
happen
were
we
to
accept
petitioners'
invitation
in
these
cases.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
i
say
of
residual
tort
liability
to
the
extent
that
the
state
does
not
provide
a
remedy.
and,
the
state
may
fail
to
provide
a
remedy--
mr.
charles
fried
--under
circumstances
very
similar
to
those
in
which
this
court
has
said
it
is
appropriate
for
the
federal
government
to
fail
to
provide
a
remedy.
and,
i
think,
again,
the
chapel
case
is
a
very
good
parallel
because
there
there
is
a
similar
balancing
of
the
state's
needs
and
the
inconvenience
of
granting
a
remedy
and
the
court
came
out
with
the
conclusion
that
one
ought
to
hesitate
before
applying
such
a
remedy.
here,
it
is
the
legislature
which
engaged
in
that
balancing
and
we
suggest
that
that
was
not
an
unreasonable
process
of
balancing.
it
was
a
reasonable
one
and,
of
course,
new
jersey
leaves
a
claim
for
remedy
against
the
prisoner
who
himself
inflicted
the
injury.
you
may
say
that
is
a
worthless
claim.
alas,
many
persons
injured
are
injured
by
insolvent
defendants.
mr.
charles
fried
if
the
tort
is
intentional,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
is
an
important
point
for
us
to
seek
to
clear
up,
if
the
tort
is
intentional,
you
are
very
likely
to
have
an
eighth
amendment
or
the
shocks-the-conscience
kind
of
substantive
deprivation.
you
may
very
well
have
a
fourth
amendment
violation
as
there
was
lurking
in
the
wings
in
hudson
against
palmer.
mr.
charles
fried
it
would,
indeed.
and,
i
think--
mr.
charles
fried
--oh,
i...
the
legislature
cannot
deprive
a
citizen
of
his
rights.
new
jersey
legislature
cannot
deprive
a
citizen
of
his
rights
under
the
eighth
amendment.
mr.
charles
fried
i
think
that
is
a
very
important
part
of
it,
yes,
your
honor.
thank
you
so
much.
