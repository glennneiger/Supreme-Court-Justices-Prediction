what
did
the
prisoner
do
that
was
voluntary?
did
he
go
to
jail
voluntarily?
justice

marshall
did
he
stay
there
voluntarily?
justice

well,
how
do
you
get
involuntarily?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
compare
him
with
the
man
in
the
street
struck
by
an
automobile.
i
fail
to
see
the
comparison.
justice

but,
he
stood
in
the
street.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and,
he
didn't
have
to
stand
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
didn't
have
to
stand
in
that
street.
justice

so,
isn't
that
the
difference?
the
prisoner
has
to
do
whatever
the
guard
tells
him
to
do,
whenever
he
tells
him
to
do
it,
and
however
he
tells
him
to
do
it,
and
that
is
the
difference
between
that
and
an
ordinary
citizen
getting
stuck
by
an
automobile.
