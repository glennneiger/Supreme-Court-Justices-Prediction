there
you
could
argue
that
the
state
actor
did,
in
a
general
sense,
intend
the
taking
and
meet
a
general
intent
requirement.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
too
would
limit
recovery
to
the
prison
setting
i
would
conclude.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
your
answer
in
part
to
the
execution
question
is
that
there
was
an
intent
to
execute
someone.
it
wasn't
an
unintended
consequence
of
the
action.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
it
can
be
deprivation.
but,
in
the
circumstance
that
we
just
heard
about
of
a
pillow
on
the
stairs,
it
was
never
contemplated
or
intended
that
someone
would
be
physically
injured
as
a
result
of
placement
of
a
pillow
on
the
stairs.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
fried,
i
suppose
the
petitioners
in
these
two
cases
would
say
to
you,
well,
we
are
only
concerned
about
the
situation
in
a
prison
setting.
