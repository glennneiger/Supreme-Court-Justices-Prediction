justice
byron
r.
white
--the
basis
for
the
claim
is
that
the
state
has
deprived
the
person
of
liberty.
justice
byron
r.
white
through
negligence.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
still
hooked
to
a
deprivation
of
liberty.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
without
any
remedy
for
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
would
you
say
that
if
there
is
remedy
there
never
was
a
deprivation,
a
constitutional
deprivation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about...
you
say
negligence
never
then,
is
that
it,
can
form
the
basis?
what
about
a
negligence
in
knowing
what
the
law
is,
what
the
governing
law
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
what
if
there
is
a
standard
of
law...
a
standard
of
conduct
imposed
by
law
that
says
you
may
not
do
this
or
you
may
or
you
may
not
do
certain
things
and
some
prison
guard
just
doesn't
know
what
the
law
is
and
he
goes
ahead
and
does
it
intentionally.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
how
about
gross
negligence
or
recklessness?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
just
simple
negligence,
negligently
failing
to
give
medical
treatment
is
not...
doesn't
give
a
cause
of
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
we
have
held...
is
that
because
the
eighth
amendment
controls?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
think
that
it
could
be
any
other
kind
of
a
case?
i
am
surprised
that
you
just
don't
argue
that
in
the
prison
context
the
eighth
amendment
should
really
govern
just
like
it
did
in
estelle.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
took
some
rather
recent
cases
to
make
all
that
so
awfully
clear.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
may
not
have
been
all
that
clear
for
a
long,
long
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
nevertheless,
if
it
had
been
all
that
clear
about
the
due
process
clause,
that
language
wouldn't
have
appeared
in
parratt.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
if
the
states
have
provided
remedies,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
they
may.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
happens
to
the
state's
freedom
when
the
tort
is
intentional?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
would
deprive
the
state
of
its
immunity.
justice
byron
r.
white
despite
the
legislature's
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
your
argument
really
hinges
on
the
construction
of
the
word
"deprive".
