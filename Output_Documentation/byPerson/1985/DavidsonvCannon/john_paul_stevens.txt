justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
when
you
say
we
have
a
clear
duty
here,
what
is
the
source
of
that
duty?
is
it
federal
law
or
state
law,
the
duty
not
to
be
negligent
in
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
is
in
the
due
process
clause?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
i
guess
you
would
give
me
the
same
answer
that
was
given
in
the
previous
case,
that
if
a
visitor
was
injured
by
an
inmate
by
reason
of
negligent
supervision
by
the
guards,
the
visitor
would
have
no
cause
of
action.
say
he
injured
both
the
visitor
and
an
inmate,
but
the
inmate
would.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
it
is
his
status
as
an
inmate
rather
than
the
fact
of
immunity
that
really
is
the
predicate
for
the
federal
claim.
justice
john
paul
stevens
immunity
is
crucial
but
it
is
not
sufficient
because...
i
am
not
sure
under
the
new
jersey
statute,
but
you
conceivably
could
have
an
immunity
statute
which
would
bar
a
claim
by
a
visitor
as
well
as
an
inmate
and
that
wouldn't
be
sufficient
to
give
them
a
federal
claim
though,
because
you
need
both
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
the
same
question
i
guess
i
asked
earlier,
but
your
submission
is
that
negligence
can
never
constitute
a
deprivation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
the
warden
negligently
executed
the
wrong
defendant
and
killed
him
by
mistake.
would
that
not
be
a
deprivation
of
life?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
wrong
with
my
hypothetical?
couldn't
they
make
a
mistake?
it
is
conceivable.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
right,
but
they
didn't
say
that...
they
didn't
rely
on
the
reason
of
negligence
not
constituting
a
deprivation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
take
that
case.
supposing
a
sheriff
makes
out
a
search
warrant
and
negligently
they
type
in
the
wrong
name
and
search
the
wrong
house.
would
there
not
be
a
deprivation
of
the
right
to
be
free
of
an
unreasonable
search
just
because
it
was
negligent
instead
of
deliberate?
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
whether
the
constitutional
right
has
been
violated?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
you
are
not
contending
that
negligence
can
never
give
rise
to
a
1983
action.
you
are
just
saying
never
give
rise
to
a
deprivation
of
liberty.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
may
i
ask
this
question?
you
have
separated
prisoners
out
in
your
immunity
statute
as
i
read
it.
the
prisoner
may
not
recover
for
this
kind
of
negligence,
but
a
visitor
could.
a
visitor
or
a
guard
could
recover
if
the
guard
was
negligent
and
an
inmate,
instead
of
injuring
a
fellow
inmate,
injured
either
the
visitor
or
the
guard.
so,
you
have
put
the
prisoner
in
a
lesser
position
than
the
others,
is
that
not
correct?
