mr.
r.
stephen
mc
nally
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
direct
appeal
taken
from
an
original
probate
action
in
west
texas.
the
appellant
was
denied
inheritance
rights
from
her
father
on
the
basis
that
she
was
an
illegitimate
child.
three
questions
are
presented:
first
of
all,
whether
this
court's
decision
in
triable
v.
gordon
is
binding
authority
where
the
father
died
before
trimble
was
decided
and
suit
was
filed
afterwards
in
his
open
estate;
second,
whether
any
sufficient
state
interest
supports
enforcement
of
the
naked
status
of
bastardy
after
the
father's
death;
and
third,
whether
the
preference
of
surviving
fathers
over
surviving
mothers
is
substantially
related
to
any
sufficient
state
interest.
the
appellant
in
this
case
is
delynda
ann
ricker
barker
reed.
the
christian
names
delynda
ann
were
chosen
for
her
by
her
natural
father,
prince
ricker,
whose
surname
she
had
until
she
was
adopted
about
the
time
she
started
elementary
school,
by
jerry
barker.
the
reed
is
her
married
name.
the
procedural
posture
of
this
case
is
particularly
relevant
because
we
are
talking
about
whether
the
application
of
a
decision
of
this
court
is
defeated
by
that
posture.
this
was
from
an
order
entered
in
open
probate
on
which
there
were
five
other
children
of
prince
ricker
and
the
appellant.
the
order
excluded
the
appellant
delynda
from
the
estate.
the
probate
of
that
estate
is
still
going
on
in
open
administration
in
the
trial
court.
there
has
never
been
an
order
entered
declaring
who
the
heirs
are
to
this
day.
there
has
never
been
an
order
entered
on
which
any
third
parties
would
rely
stating
who
the
heirs
are.
the
probate
is
still
open.
the
assets
have
not
been
vested
by
a
decree.
in
this
posture,
full
precedential
authority
should
be
given
to
the
case
of
trimble
v.
gordon
because
the
statute
involved
in
this
case
is
an
insurmountable
barrier
indistinguishable
from
the
insurmountable
barrier
struck
down
in
trimble,
and
because
the
estate
is
still
open.
mr.
r.
stephen
mc
nally
your
honor,
the
statute
at
issue
regarding
inheritance
is
the
1956
version
of
section
42
of
the
texas
probate
code.
section
42
has
been
amended
twice
since
prince
ricker
died.
however,
under
the
texas
constitution,
statutes
and
precedents,
it's
the
statutes
which
are
in
effect
at
the
time
of
his
death
which
determine
or
under
which
the
passage
of
title
of
his
estate
is
determined,
and
in
the
case
of
lovejoy
v.
lillie,
the
court
looked
at
this
statute,
the
1956
version,
and
struck
it
down,
allowing
inheritance
to
be--
mr.
r.
stephen
mc
nally
--yes.
it's
the
same
statute
that
was
in...
that
passed
on
in
lovejoy
v.
lillie.
and
the
texas
supreme
court
considered
the
1956
statute
in
davis
v.
jones
and
admitted
that
it
lacked
suitable
alternatives
to
marriage
under
trimble.
so
there
have
been
at
least
two
state
court
rulings
on
this
particular
1956
statute
as
applicable
to
persons...
estates
of
persons
who
died
before--
mr.
r.
stephen
mc
nally
--your
honor,
trimble...
in
trimble
this
court
struck
down
the
illinois
statute
because
it
made
marriage
a
sine
qua
non
for
inheritance
by
an
illegitimate
child.
the
1956
statute
allowed
inheritance
only
if
there
had
been
a
marriage
between
the
parents.
there
was
no
other
way
that
the
inheritance
is
allowed
under
the
1956
statute
for
an
illegitimate
child.
mr.
r.
stephen
mc
nally
in
texas,
that's
correct.
mr.
r.
stephen
mc
nally
your
honor,
there...
under
the
common
law,
of
course,
in
texas,
there
was
no
right
of
support
for
an
illegitimate
child.
this
court
struck
down
that
common
lay
and
statute
in
gomez
v.
perez.
after
gomez,
there
was
a
judicial
remedy
for
the
14th
amendment
right
recognizing
gomez
to
child
support
for
children
that
had...
however,
by
that
time,
delynda
had
been
adopted,
and
when
she
was
adopted,
her
rights
were,
to
any
support
were
cut
off
by
article
46(a)
of
the
then
in
effect--
mr.
r.
stephen
mc
nally
--your
honor,
there
was
no
legal
effect
on
her
inheritance
rights
of
the
adoption,
and
so
no,
it
was
newer
an
issue.
a
legitimate
child--
mr.
r.
stephen
mc
nally
--your
honor,
under
section
46(a)
which
was
in
effect
when
delynda
was
adopted...
that
was
article
46(a)
of
vernon's
annotated
texas
statutes...
an
adoption
severs
all
the
rights
except
the
right
of
the
child
to
inherit
from
the
natural
parent.
mr.
r.
stephen
mc
nally
yes.
a
legitimate
child
has
that
right,
and
that's
why
it's
no
severed.
an
illegitimate
child
never
has
the
right,
and
that's
why--
mr.
r.
stephen
mc
nally
--well,
no,
your
honor.
our
rights
were
not...
to
inherit
were
not
terminated
by
the
adoption.
it's
the
fact
that
we
never
had
any
rights
to
inherit
before
the
adoption
or
after
the
adoption.
mr.
r.
stephen
mc
nally
no,
your
honor.
she
was
excluded
from
chapter
13
in
at
least
two
ways
during
the
entire
time
her
father
was
alive.
the
first
way
is
chapter
13
gave
no
relief
at
all
to
a
child
born
before
its
effective
date
in
september
of
1975.
delynda
was
born
in
1958,
so
right
there
she
was
totally
excluded
from
chapter
13.
moreover,
this
court
had
chapter
13
before
it
in
mills,
noted
the
one
year
statute
is
not
sufficient,
but
delynda
didn't
even
have
a
technical
right
under
that
one
year
statute
because
she
was
over
one
year
old
when
it
was
enacted.
when
they
amended
it
to
four
years,
she
was
over
four
years
old.
she
never
had
a
chance
there.
and
she
was
over
twenty
years
old
when
they
made
the
most
recent
amendment
to
twenty
years.
it's
just
kept
moving
away.
mr.
r.
stephen
mc
nally
but
the
effect
is
you've
had
an
insurmountable
barrier
in
the
statute
of
limitations
the
whole
time,
as
well
as
the
insurmountable
barrier
in
the
effective
date
of
the
statute.
under
that
provision
as
construed
by
the
constitution,
it
gave
a
valuable
right
of
legitimation
to
certain
illegitimate
children,
those
that
were
born
late
enough
and
those
that
brought
suit
within
the
statute
of
limitations
as
extended.
those
children
had
a...
as
a
matter
of
right
had
the
right
to
an
order
designating
them
to
be
the
father
of
the
child...
the
child's...
that
the
father
was
the
father
upon
a
jury
finding,
under...
and
that
was
under
13.08
of
the
family
code.
they
had,
that's
the
court
shall
enter
that
order.
and
under
13.09,.09
of
the
family
code,
the
effect
of
the
order
is
that
the
child
is
the
child
of
the
father
as
though
born
to
the
parents
within
lawful
matrimony.
it
was
a
full
legitimation.
also,
the
family
code
gave
the
right
to
attorneys
fees
to
a
child
born
late
enough
who
brought
suit
soon
enough,
and
that's
a
valuable
due
process
right
because
the
state
imposes
on
illegitimate
children
a
requirement
of
proving
paternity,
does
not
impose
the
same
requirement
on
a
legitimate
child.
the
legitimate
child
just
shows
motherhood
and
marriage,
never
has
to
show
access,
chastity
of
the
mother,
that
sort
of
thing.
so
there's
a
heavier
burden
to
prove
on
the
illegitimate
child.
the
texas
statute
gave
some
relief
for
hearing
that
burden
in
the
form
of
attorney's
fees,
but
only
to
certain
children,
those
born
after
september
1,
1975,
those
who
had
a
chance
to
bring
the
action
within
the
statute
of
limitations
as
extended.
delynda
never
had
any
chance
to
bring
an
action
under
the
family
code.
it
has
been
an
insurmountable
barrier
to
her
the
entire
time.
mr.
r.
stephen
mc
nally
the
lower
court
denied
inheritance
rights
and
said
that
also
a
reasonable
basis
supported
excluding
delynda
from
the
1979
probate
code
which,
of
course,
incorporated
the
family
code.
as
far
as
trimble
goes,
it
applied
a
time
of
filing
test.
under
this
test,
trimble
is
not
binding
authority
if
the
father
was
born...
died
before
trimble
and
the
suit
was
first
file
afterwards.
the
time
of
filing
test
is
not
sensitive
to
whether
or
not
the
estate
was
open,
and
therefore,
for
example,
if
the
child
brought
suit
before
trimble
father
earlier,
it
would
reopen
by
collateral
attack
the
estate.
mr.
r.
stephen
mc
nally
yes,
and
enforce...
and
enforceable
after
trimble
by
the
time
of
filing
test
as
a
way
of
saying,
well,
trimble
is
not
binding
authority.
that
is
not
a
good
test,
your
honor.
there
are
two
better
forms
of
retro...
well,
three,
really.
this
court
has
historically
used
three
forms
of
retroactivity
analysis,
a
blackstonian,
all
decisions
were
automatically
retroactive.
then,
since
about
1965
or
so
in
the
civil
area
you
have
had
the
chevron
test,
which
was
a
three-part
test.
and
recently
in
the
criminal
area
the
court
has
addressed--
mr.
r.
stephen
mc
nally
--died
about
four
months
before
trimble.
mr.
r.
stephen
mc
nally
the
claim
was
made
i
guess
about
a
year
after
trimble.
mr.
r.
stephen
mc
nally
well,
it
conceded--
mr.
r.
stephen
mc
nally
--the
statute's
invalid.
mr.
r.
stephen
mc
nally
but
they're
going
to
apply
it.
mr.
r.
stephen
mc
nally
well,
they
applied
it
to
exclude
this
person
from
inheriting
but
effectively
conceded
that
it
is
repugnant
to
the
14th
amendment
under
trimble.
they
just
said,
well,
trimble
isn't
the
law,
wasn't
the
law
when
he
died,
and
although
it
is
now
the
law
as
we
are
trying
the
case
and
as
the
case
is
on
appeal,
we're
just
not
going
to
apply
trimble.
we're
going
to
act
like
trimble
never
happened,
and
what
we're
going
to
apply
is
really
nothing,
no
form
of
equal
protection
analysis
at
all.
before
trimble
was
decided,
this
court
had
repeatedly,
had
never
sustained
since
levy
v.
louisiana,
this
court
had
never
sustained
an
insurmountable
barrier
based
on
illegitimate
status,
and
if
they
didn't
want
to
apply
trimble,
they
should
have
applied
gomez
v.
perez
which
said
that
the
state
of
tarrier
based
on
illegitimacy
violates
the
14th
amendment.
the
lower
court
refused
to
apply
any
form
of
equal
protection
analysis.
mr.
r.
stephen
mc
nally
your
honor,
we
are
seeking
no
support
at
this
point.
we
dismissed
the
support
claim
prior
to
trial
by
determining
that
under
state
law,
even
a
legitimate
child
would
have
had
no
rights
to
support.
we
just
didn't
think
we
could
get
it
as
an
adopted
child.
we
considered
that
our
rights
to
support
were
terminated
by
the
adoption.
so
we're
not
seeking
any--
mr.
r.
stephen
mc
nally
--we're
seeking
inheritance
but
also
the
status
of
legitimation
which
is
given
to
certain
illegitimate
children
by
chapter
13.
chapter
13
of
the
family
code
doesn't
itself
give
any
support.
it's
just
a
legitimation
statute.
that
legitimation
is...
gives
a
right
to
a
status.
mr.
r.
stephen
mc
nally
your
honor,
the
federal
claim
is
that
here
you
have
a
denial
of
a
right
to
legitimate
social
status,
legitimate
legal
status,
and
to
the
attorneys
fees,
and
that
those
are,
we
would
submit,
substantial
rights
apart
from--
mr.
r.
stephen
mc
nally
--your
honor,
if
the
state
hadn't
given
certain
other
illegitimate
children
the
right
to
legitimation
and
attorneys
fees,
equal
protection
would
not
take
any
cognizance
of
it.
but
the
state
has
come
in
with
a
statute
and
given
certain
other
illegitimate
children,
based
on
their
date
of
birth,
based
on
their
at
least
having
a
chance
to
file
the
claim,
these
valuable
rights
to
be...
to
escape
from
the
stigma
of
illegitimacy,
and
since
the
state
has
taken
that
step,
the
14th
amendment
looks
at
that
to
see
if
the
exclusions
pass
the
mills
test.
mills
requires
that
exclusions
from
a
grant
of
rights
must
first
of
all
give
a
reasonable
opportunity
for
those
excluded
to
be
availed
of
the
rights.
it's
illegitimate
children.
and
delynda
never
had
any
opportunity.
so
the
first
element
of
the
mills
test
is
not
satisfied.
and
secondly,
it
requires
a
substantial
relationship
to
a
permissible
state
interest,
and
here
it
is
significant
that
we
are
looking
for
the
status
of
legitimacy
as
far
as
the
family
code
goes.
we
are
not
necessarily
asking,
we're
not
asking
under
the
family
code
for
inheritance,
we're
not
asking
for
support.
we're
just
asking
to
be
legitimate.
all
of
there
state
interests
that
the
court
has
recognized
in
denying
relief
have
had
to
do
with
the
need
to
have
settled
title
to
real
estate
or
avoid
stale
or
fraudulent
claims.
those
stated
interests
are
not
involved
here.
we're
just
asking
for
the
social,
the
legal
status
of
legitimacy.
mr.
r.
stephen
mc
nally
well,
that
is...
yes,
your
honor.
however,
that
is
not
under
the
family
code.
mr.
r.
stephen
mc
nally
under
the
family
code...
yes,
we're
asking
for
inheritance
by
looking
at
the
probate
statutes
in
effect
when
prince
ricker
died,
the
insurmountable
barrier,
and
the
analysis
that
trimble
should
be
applied.
this
court
has
used,
in
recent
times,
since
1965,
discussed
retroactivity
in
two
contexts.
the
civil
retroactivity
has
been
governed
by
chevron
v.
huson,
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
under
chevron
the
purpose
of
trimble
is
germane.
the
second
of
the
chevron
elements
is
whether
the
purpose
of
trimble
v.
gordon
would
be
served
or
hindered
by
being
applied
in
an
open
estate.
trimble
has
two
purposes.
the
first
purpose
is
the
fairness
interest,
the
fairness...
the
interest
of
the
child
and
of
the
state
itself
to
recognizing
fair
claims,
and
the
other
interest
is
preserving
security
of
title
to
land
and
orderly
probate.
here
we
have
an
open
estate.
we
are
going...
the
only
way
to
recognize
the
fairness
interest
is
to
allow
inheritance,
and
that
can
be
done
in
this
case
because
the
estate
is
open,
without
jeopardizing
orderly
probate
and
without
jeopardizing
security
of
title
to
land.
the
most
recent
analysis
that
this
court
has
applied
in
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendment
context
also
looks
carefully
to
whether
the
estate
is
open
or
close,
and
the
court
has
said
in
u.s.
v.
johnson
that
a
new
decision,
constitutional
decision,
should
be
applied
unless
it
works
a
sharp
break
with
the
past,
in
cases
pending
on
direct
appeal.
this
case
is
pending
on
direct
appeal,
and
it
doesn't
work
any
sharp
break
with
the
past.
insurmountable
barrier
analysis
was
not
created
in
trimble.
it
was
there
long
before
trimble
so
that
trimble
did
not
apply
any
new
analysis.
under
the
u.s.
v.
johnson,
trimble
should
also
be
given
retroactive
application
in
an
open
estate.
the
dissent
in
u.s.
v.
johnson
was
very
concerned
about
whether
the
purpose
of
the
exclusionary
rule
was
served
by
retroactive
application.
that
concern
was
not
present
in
this
case
because
the
purpose
of
trimble
is
served,
both
purposes
of
trimble
are
served
by
application
in
this
estate
and
are
defeated
by...
would
be
defeated
by
a
refusal
to
apply
trimble
in
this
case.
mr.
r.
stephen
mc
nally
my
client
is
now
about
28
years
old,
your
honor.
she
has
two
children
of
her
own.
mr.
r.
stephen
mc
nally
your
honor,
we
don't
know
exactly.
we
were
excluded
from
the
estate.
it
involves
a
fraction
of
the
minerals
under
a
portion
of
an
original
ranch
that
was
about
i
think
2,800
acres.
i
believe
that
this
is
a
one-sixth
share
of
the
minerals
under
one-fourth
of
the
original
ranch.
i
have
received
different
reports
as
to
the
amount
that
delynda's
share
would
be.
i
understand
that
her
brothers
and
sisters
are
currently
receiving
somewhere
between
$2,2500
a
month
and
i
have
heard
as
high
as
$4,000
a
month.
i
really
don't
know.
with
regard
to
the
discrimination
based
on
sex,
some
of
the
analysis
set
out
by
this
court
in
mills
is
relevant
that
is
after
gomez.
both
the
parents
have
the
duty
to
support
the
child.
even
after
gomez,
the
father
has
one
way
to
escape
that.
he
may
never
be
adjudicated
the
father,
and
in
that
case,
he
still
will
be,
for
example,
immune
from
prosecution
for
nonsupport.
but
if
he
is
adjudicated
to
be
the
father,
he
still...
there
is
still
a
preference
that
benefits
him
over
a
surviving
mother.
under
section
109
of
the
probate
code,
a
surviving
parent
is
automatically
the
guardian
of
the
child's
person
and
property.
the
mother
would
be
the
guardian,
the
father
would
be
the
guardian,
but
if
the
mother
is
the
guardian,
the
child
has
no
estate
that
could
help
her
to
raise
the
child.
if
she
is
needy,
she
has
no
assets
there
in
the
estate
because
the
child
could
not
inherit
from
the
father,
whereas
if
it
is
the
mother
that
dies,
because
the
statutes
have
come
in
and
modified
the
common
law,
the
child
can
inherit
from
the
mother,
there
is
some
estate
of
the
child,
the
father
would
have
some
recourse
to
help
him
raise
the
child
if
he
is
in
a
needy
circumstance.
thus,
a
father
is
preferred
over
a
mother,
and
that
is
inherent
in
the
texas
statutes.
mr.
r.
stephen
mc
nally
that
is
directed
to
the
sex
discrimination
portion
of
the
denial
of
inheritance,
that
it
is...
if
delynda
was
one
of
the
one's
whose
mother
died
without
a
will,
she
would
be
allowed
to
inherit.
mr.
r.
stephen
mc
nally
exactly.
in
effect,
the
analysis
of
the
lower
court
is
that
we
just
don't
look
at
equal
protection
if
trimble
is
retroactive.
this
is
an
example
of
an
equal
protection
ground
where
there
is
no
retroactivity
question
because
it
hasn't
been
decided
yet
by
the
court.
mr.
r.
stephen
mc
nally
your
honor,
it's
a
claim
for
mothers
of
children
in
delynda's
classification
who
are
foreseeable
impacted
by--
mr.
r.
stephen
mc
nally
--of
course,
that
would
be
a
clearer
and
stronger
case
if
you
did.
the
standing...
i
believe
delynda
does
have
standing
to
make
the
argument,
a
jus
tertii
standing
under
craig
v.
roren
because
it
is
delynda's
own
rights
that
are
affected.
the
mother's
are
only
affected
derivatively.
it's
delynda's
rights
which
are
affected
directly.
mr.
r.
stephen
mc
nally
that's
exactly
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
stephen
mc
nally
yes,
your
honor.
we
are
requesting
that
the
court
separately
consider...
we
would
not...
we
would
be
pleased
to
inherit
under
trimble--
mr.
r.
stephen
mc
nally
--yes.
mr.
r.
stephen
mc
nally
yes.
mr.
r.
stephen
mc
nally
well,
there
is
the
statute
limitations,
although
it
is
not
really
statute
of
limitations
since
they
gave
a
one
year
statute
after
she
was
one
year
old,
and
these
are
non-tolling
statutes.
mr.
r.
stephen
mc
nally
your
honor,
in
effect
that
was
the
alternative
ruling
that...
and
they
were
looking,
they
were
saying,
well,
if
you
apply
the
1979
statute,
then
we
think
that
there
was
a
reasonable
basis
to
exclude
you
from
the
family
code
so
you
don't
inherit
under
the
1979
statute.
that
was
not
necessarily
a
factual
thing.
they
were
saying
that
a
matter
of
law,
there's
a
reasonable
state
basis,
so
that
the
family
code--
mr.
r.
stephen
mc
nally
--yes.
now,
the
third
basis
that
the
lower
court
may
have
been
concerned
with
is
whether
the
legitimation
action
is
available
after
death
because
that,
we
did
first
bring
this
action,
of
course,
after
price
ricker
was
dead,
and
the
lower...
the
texas
courts
have
never
ruled
that
it's
not
available
after
the
father
dies.
what
we
would
say
to
this
court
is
that
the
court
doesn't
need
to
know
whether
the
state
courts
will
construe
it
that
way
or
not
to
know
that
delynda
is
entitled
to
the
relief
because
if
they
construe
it
that
way,
it's
clearly
a
violation
of
the
14th
amendment.
mr.
r.
stephen
mc
nally
your
honor,
the
attorneys
fees
are
also
a
valuable
right,
and
they
are
both
important.
the
attorneys
fees
are
afforded
under
13.42(b)
of
the
family
code.
mr.
r.
stephen
mc
nally
your
honor,
the
position
of
the
attorneys
fees
in
this...
i
would
agree
that
certainly
the
attorneys
fees
request
is
much
less
compelling
than
the
fact
that
we
also
have
the
status
of
bastardy
at
stake,
but
turning
to
the
attorneys
fees,
you
have
an
exceptionally
sensitive
area
because
they
touch
on
both
due
process
and
equal
protection
rights,
essentially
equal
protection
and
access
to
due
process
because
the
state
imposes
the
requirement
of
proven
paternity
only
on
an
illegitimate
child.
a
legitimate
child
has
the
benefit
of
a
presumption,
after
showing
maternity
and
marriage,
they
don't
have
to
prove
paternity.
only
the
illegitimate
child
has
to
prove
that--
so
the
state
has
imposed
a
burden
on
the
illegitimate
child.
then
it
has
come
in
and
given
some
illegitimate
children
some
help
with
that
burden,
a
right
to
an
award
of
attorneys
fees
but
not
to
others,
and
so
we
are
in
the
sensitive
area
of
equal
protection,
again,
with
due
process--
mr.
r.
stephen
mc
nally
--your
honor,
those
are
fundamental
constitutional
rights.
mr.
r.
stephen
mc
nally
well,
more
fundamental
than
just
a
right
to
money
as
attorneys
fees
which
you
were
saying
there
were
some
cases
the
court
has
held
that
insufficient.
mr.
r.
stephen
mc
nally
are
you
asking
if
the
request
to
be
legitimated
is
a
concrete
interest
or
are
you
still
solely
on
the
attorneys
fees?
mr.
r.
stephen
mc
nally
it
would
depend
on
how
fundamental
the
court
had
judged
the
right
to
be
legitimated
and
the
right
to
attorneys
fees
in
that
context,
equivalent
statutory
rights.
if
the
court
feels
that
those
are
not
significant
or
constitutionally
significant
or
cognizable
rights,
then
certainly
it
wouldn't
be
compelled,
but
you
know,
you
wouldn't
be
compelled
to
strike
down
the
statute.
however,
i
would
urge
the
court
that
the
status
of
illegitimacy
is
a
heavy
burden,
there
is
still
stigma
attached
to
it.
there
have
been
studies
that
show
that
the
iq
of
illegitimate
children
is
lower
and
gets
progressively
lower
through
the
years.
there
is
still
a
stigma,
i
will
represent
to
the
court,
felt
by
my
client
very
keenly
in
that
denomination
by
the
state
courts.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
r.
stephen
mc
nally
thank
you,
your
honor.
first,
does
the
court
have
any
other
questions?
i
do
have
one
or
two
things
i
will
mention
if
you
don't.
your
honor,
the
winn
action,
which
recognized
the
invalidity
of
the
date
of
birth
provision,
has
never
been
applied
in
texas
to
recognize
anything
other
than
the
right
of
child
support.
it
was
not
the
equivalent,
it
has
never
given
the
equivalent
relief
available
under
the
family
code
action,
it
has
never
given
legitimation,
it
has
never
given
attorneys
fees.
the
winn
action
was
available
until
delynda
was
22,
or
a
winn
action
is
available
until
the
child
is
22.
delynda
filed
this
action
before
she
was
22,
so
if
this
is
a
winn
action
in
probate,
which
would
be
a
trimble
action,
we're
within
it.
the
court
had
before
it
in
mills
all
three
methods
which
the
appellees
now
claim
were
sufficient
reasons
for
denying
inheritance.
mills
rejected
voluntary
child
support
by
the
father
as
a
sufficient
means
for
child
support.
it
rejected
the
one-year
statute
which
gave
the
claimant
in
mills
a
much
better
chance
to
get
child
support
than
we
have
had
to
be
legitimated
in
this
case,
and
in
mills
it
rejected
marriage,
which
is
the
third
of
the
methods.
these
are...
these
methods
have
already
been
considered
by
the
court
and
rejected
as
not
constitutionally
sufficient.
mr.
r.
stephen
mc
nally
that's
correct.
mr.
r.
stephen
mc
nally
your
honor,
i
would
think
that
the
first
time
that
texas
allowed
it
would
be
in
1977
because
the
voluntary
legitimation
for
support
purposes
was
enacted
right
after
gomez
in
'73.
technically
if
the
father
had
agreed
and
gone
in
the
sworn
that
that
was
his
child
in
'73,
and
then
died
after,
right
after
1977,
that
would
have
been
the
earliest.
mr.
r.
stephen
mc
nally
other
than
that,
the
first
probate
significance
for
the
chapter
13
paternity
suit
was
in
1979.
if
your
father
didn't
died
after
august
27,
1979,
there
was
no
way
that
that
would
help
you.
mr.
r.
stephen
mc
nally
your
honor,
yes,
the
estate
had
already
been
filed.
it
was
pending
on
file
from
january
of
1977,
so
it
had
been
on
file
for
some
months.
delynda's
claim
for
inheritance
was
not
filed
until
after
trimble,
but
there
was
an
application
on
file
stating
that
the
other
heirs
were
the
heirs
of
the
estate
when
trimble
came
down.
mr.
r.
stephen
mc
nally
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
that's
clear
from
the
opinion
also.
it
says
even
if
the
1979
statute
applied,
that
the
family
code
was
reasonable.
but
the
opinion
makes
it
clear
it's
the
1956
statute
that
it
was
talking
about.
