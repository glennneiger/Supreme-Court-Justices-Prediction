justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
federal
claim
is
there
to
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
point
in
your
argument
is
that
observation
directed
to?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
is
this
argument
an
alternative
ground
to
trimble
v.
gordon's
retroactivity?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
delynda...
this
isn't
a
claim
of
delynda,
it's
a
claim
of
her
mother,
as
i
understand
it,
who
apparently
is
alive
and
perfectly
capable
of
making
the
claim
if
she
wants
to.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
shouldn't
we
wait
for
mothers
to
make
that
claim?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we...
our
cases
of
this...
it
seems
to
me
some
of
them
have
said
that
attorneys
fees
by
two
selves
don't
indicate
a
sufficient
real
interest
in
the
case.
it's
like
costs,
in
a
way,
the
fact
that
costs
may
be
outstanding
doesn't
keep
a
case
alive.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
part
of
the
family
code?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
insofar
as
they
make
their
trimble
v.
gordon
argument,
doesn't
it
make
a
difference
on
that?
it's
at
least
theoretically
possible
that
they
will
convince
us...
i'm
not
saying
they
will...
that
the
trimble
v.
gordon
was
the
law
as
applied
to
any
estates
that
hadn't
been
closed
at
that
time.
that's
one
of
the
things
they
argue.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
when
was
the
first
time,
'78?
