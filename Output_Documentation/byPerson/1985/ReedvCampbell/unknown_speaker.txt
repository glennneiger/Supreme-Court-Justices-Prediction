unknown
speaker
what
statute
is
at
issue?
unknown
speaker
and
what
does
trimble
have
to
do
with
it?
unknown
speaker
in
texas.
unknown
speaker
she
missed
out
on
them.
unknown
speaker
so
what
was
the
decision
below?
unknown
speaker
so
she
was
barred
by
the
1956
statute
which
was
deemed
to
be
in
effect
and
valid
prior
to
trimble.
unknown
speaker
so
ricker
died
before
trimble.
unknown
speaker
and
the
court
said
this
statute
will
still
be
deemed
valid
for
this
purpose.
unknown
speaker
well,
it--
unknown
speaker
--it
nevertheless
barred--
unknown
speaker
--well,
they're
going
to
apply
it.
they
think
it's
valid
enough
to
exclude
this
person
from
inheriting.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mcnally,
if
you
prevail
here,
you
want
of
course
inheritance
rights.
do
you
want
something
more
than
that?
do
you
want
support
money
for
the
period
prior
to
death?
unknown
speaker
so
it's
only
the
inheritance
that
you
want.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
may
be,
but
are
they
federal
constitutional
rights?
unknown
speaker
well,
you're
asking
for
inheritance.
unknown
speaker
how
old
is
your
client
now?
unknown
speaker
mr.
mcnally,
can
i
ask
in
this
connection,
as
i
understand
your
response
to
justice
rehnquist,
if
you
should
prevail
on
the
retroactivity,
as
we
call
it,
of
trimble
argument,
then
there's
no
need
to
reach
this
argument,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
is
that
also
true
with
respect
to
your
argument
seeking
legitimate...
legitimation?
as
i
understood
the
lower
court
opinion,
that
was
discussed
only
in
connection
with
the
basic
claim
of
right
to
a
share
of
the
estate.
are
you
asking
independently
that
even
if
you
win
and
get
your
share
of
the
estate
under
the
trimble
retroactivity
point,
you
still
want
separate
consideration
of
the
legitimation
issue?
unknown
speaker
and
what
is
your...
well,
but
doesn't
that...
confining
it
to
that
second
question,
what
is
your...
your
theory
is
that
this
cutoff
date
of
september
whatever
the
year
was,
that
denied
your
client
equal
protection,
is
that
what
it
is,
because
it
allowed
some
illegitimate
children
to
have
the
statutory
remedy
and
others
not,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
so
the
discrimination
is
between
some
illegitimates
and
other
illegitimates.
unknown
speaker
so
is
it
a
statute
of
limitations
issue
then?
unknown
speaker
but
may
i
just
finish
one
thought
on
that
question?
i
thought
the
answer
of
the
lower
court
in
part
was
that
even
under
the
statute,
if
the
date
had
not
been
there,
your
client
would
not
have
qualified
under
the
facts
of
this
case.
didn't
they
so...
that
the
father
hadn't
been...
there
are
two
or
three
ways
a
person
could
be
legitimated,
but
none
of
them
applied
to
this
particular
person?
am
i
wrong
in
that?
unknown
speaker
does
she
have
any
interest
in
obtaining
this
relief
other
than
the
interest
in
her
reputational
interest?
is
that
the
only
thing
at
stake,
really?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
is
equal
protection
and
due
process
more
"sensitive"
than
other
constitutional
areas?
unknown
speaker
more
fundamental
than
other
constitutional
rights?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
source
of
you
claim
of
right
is
one
thing.
what
you're
actually
claiming,
is
it
enough
to
make
it
a
concrete
interest
i
think
is
another.
unknown
speaker
i
think
there
might
be
a
question
as
to
either
one,
whether
the
request
to
be
legitimate
is
a
sufficiently
concrete
interest,
and
whether
a
claim
for
attorneys
fees
based
on
that
right
is
the
sort
of
claim
for
monetary
relief
that
would
give
you
standing
if
noting
else
in
your
case
did.
unknown
speaker
13.01?
unknown
speaker
and
why
did
he,
if
it
wasn't
an
issue
in
the
case,
why
did
he?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
jury
found,
the
jury
found
parenthood.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mccollum--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
mccollum.
unknown
speaker
is
it
not
true,
though,
that
if
you
had
prevailed
on
that
factual
issue
and
the
jury
had
found
otherwise,
then
there
would
be
no
claim
whatsoever
here
under
trimble
v.
gordon
retroactivity
or
anything
else?
so
it
at
least
was
an
issue,
a
threshold
issue
that
kept
her
in
court
to
get
up
here.
unknown
speaker
you
wouldn't
deny,
would
you,
that
had
the
jury
finding
been
the
other
way
you'd
be
a
lot
better
off.
unknown
speaker
but
they
did
that
after
this
man
died.
unknown
speaker
and
i
don't
suppose
that
after
this
jury
finding
that
she
could
have
started
over
again
in
another
court
and
claimed
paternity.
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--all
right,
here's
a
jury,
here's
a
determination
in
a
court
that
she
was
not
the
child
of
this
man.
do
you
think
she
could
have
started
over
and
had
it
tried
cut
again?
unknown
speaker
well,
counsel,
why...
isn't
it
true
that
the
1956
law
was
applied
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
she
didn't
succeed
in...
she
hasn't
succeeded...
she's
been
barred
from
being
an
heir
of
ricker.
unknown
speaker
was
take
some
blood
tests
of
a
dead
man,
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
well,
when
for
the
first
time
in
texas
could
you...
could
an
illegitimate
inherit
other
than
by
the
marriage
of
their
parents?
when
was
it
first
possible?
was
that
the...
'75,
i
take
it,
you
could
prove
paternity
and
get
support,
but
that
was
not
heirship.
unknown
speaker
but
if
that
hadn't
happened,
there
was
no
way
that
she
could
establish
heirship
other
than--
unknown
speaker
so
you,
you
think
the
operative
reason
for
the
denial
of
heirship
in
this
case
was
the
'56
statute
which
was
still
in
existence?
