mr.
paul
mc
collum
mr.
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
essentially
involves
but
one
issue.
from
the
record
it
established
below,
the
question
is
whether
a
substantial
federal
question
exists,
and
we
submit
that
it
does
not.
we
would
further
urge
that
the
appellant
is
ill-placed
in
this
court.
this
case
does
not
involve,
as
he
would
claim,
complex
issues
of
trans-states
impairments
of
equal
protection
that
impact
upon
numerous
persons,
nor
does
the
case
involve
the
concept
or
retroactivitity,
which
is
a
complex
concept
that
usually
implicates
a
notion
not
here,
which
is
fundamentality.
the
only
issue
in
the
case
is
substantiality.
it
is
true
that
the
substantiality
does,
under
the
present
facts,
have
two
parts.
one
is
standing,
and
more
importantly,
whether
or
not
the
texas
legislature,
in
its
response
to
trimble
and
as
in
achieving
the
goals
as
articulated
by
lalli,
came
up
with
a
good
law.
now,
then,
i
think
that
in
view
of
what
is
said,
that
an
examination
of
the
chronology
might
be
in
order
here.
now,
what
happen
was
that
in
1959,
section
42(b)
of
the
texas
probate
code
was
enacted.
under
section
42(b)
of
the
probate
code
there
was
only
one
way
that
paternal
inheritance
could
be
achieved,
and
that
was
through
intermarriage
of
the
parties.
in
1975,
chapter
13
of
the
family
code
was
enacted,
and
that
provided
for
establishment
of
paternity
for
purposes
of
child
support.
mr.
paul
mc
collum
yes,
your
honor,
she
could
have
sued
under--
mr.
paul
mc
collum
--she
could
have
sued
under
chapter
13
at
any
time
after
1979.
in
1979
the
texas
law
was,
under
judicial
interpretation,
that
all
persons
who
were
born
prior
to
the
year
1975
had
a
four-year
statute
of
limitations
to
go
on,
plus
the
statute
was
tolled
during
the
minority.
in
effect,
she
had
22
years
in
order
to
bring
it.
now,
in
actual
fact,
she
had
more
than
22
years.
in
actual
fact,
she
brought
a
suit
alleging
in
1978
that
she
was
the
heir
and
also
she
petitioned
the
district
court
for
child
support.
now,
then,
those
cases
were
later
consolidated
for
purposes
of
trial.
now,
she
remained
in
court,
surrounded
by
lawyers,
from
1978
until
the
case
was
tried
in
1982,
some
four
years
later.
now,
trimble
came
down
april
26,
1977,
and
in
response
to
trimble,
the
texas
legislature
one
month
later
enlarged
trimble
and
they
stated,
and
they
amended
section
42(b)
to
provide
not
only
for
intermarriage
as
it
held
before,
but
also
through
voluntary
legitimation
by
the
father.
now,
also
in
1979
the
texas
legislature
again
reacted
in
response
to
trimble
and
proscriptions
in
lalli,
and
the
texas
legislature
in
'79
said
that
not
only
could
they
be
born
or
conceived
during
marriage
or
in
a
null
marriage
that
later
claimed,
turned
into
a
valid
marriage,
but
also
a
voluntary
statement
of
paternity
would
legitimate
the
child
and
entitle
it
to
paternity...
paternal
inheritance,
but
also
they
said
a
third
method.
they
said
they
adopted
chapter
13.01
as
a
procedure,
as
a
third
procedure
to
establish
paternal
inheritance.
now,
chapter
13.01
provides
for
scientific
methods
to
determine
the
paternity
of
a
father.
mr.
paul
mc
collum
yes,
sir,
it--
mr.
paul
mc
collum
--yes,
sir,
it's
13.01
of
the
family
code,
your
honor.
and
that
portion
of
the
family
code
was
made
a
part
of
section
42(b)
of
the
probate
code
for
purposes
of
establishing
a
third
procedure.
now,
under
that,
also,
the
probate
code
had
the
general
four-year
statute
of
limitations
and
it
also
had
the
statute
tolled
during
the
minority
of
an
applicant.
now,
what
this
appellant
did
in
this
case,
she
filed
these
two
actions
some
14
months
after
the
death
of
prince
ricker.
they
remained
in
court
all
of
that
time
until
it
was
finally
tried.
now,
it
was
tried
on
the
thrust
of
intermarriage
under
section
42
of
the
probate
code.
they
submitted
issues
to
the
jury
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
parents
were
married
as
it
was
claimed.
the
jury
found
that
they
were
not
married.
then
they
stated
that
there
was
a
putative
marriage.
they
submitted
elements
to
establish
that.
the
jury
found
that
there
was
no
putative
marriage.
then
they
submitted
a
nonissue.
they
submitted
an
issue
that
said
was
she,
do
you
the
jury
find
that
she
is
the
daughter
of
prince
ricker,
and
the
jury
said
yes.
you
see,
that
is
a
nonissue.
that
was
ignored
by
the
trial
court
because
that
is
not
the
way
you
determine
paternity.
there
are
three
ways
that
you
can
do
it,
and
the
scientific
way
they
did
not
do.
now,
i
think
it's
important
to
know,
and
to
know
that
the
record
below
showed
that
prince
ricker
was
an
unreconstructed
alcoholic
with
associated
mental
diseases,
and
he
was--
mr.
paul
mc
collum
--yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
mc
collum
they
insisted
on
it.
they
wanted
to
do
it.
it's
a
nonissue.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
lawsuit.
mr.
paul
mc
collum
it
would
be...
it
has
no
more
bearing
if
she's
a
complete
stranger.
this
is
not
the
way,
there
is
no
way
in
texas
law
that
this
is
a
way
to
do
it.
now,
there
was
on
the
books
a
way
for
them
to
do
it.
there
was--
mr.
paul
mc
collum
--he
was
hospitalized
some
16
times
in
the
last
several
years
of
his
life
before
his
death.
mr.
paul
mc
collum
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
mc
collum
that's
what
they
contend,
judge.
mr.
paul
mc
collum
i
honestly,
your
honor,
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference.
it
makes
not
one
whit
of
difference.
i
think
probably
they
would
not
have
pursued
the
appeal
had
the
jury
so
found,
but
with
reference
to
that
finding--
mr.
paul
mc
collum
--yes,
your
honor.
texas,
in
response...
i
hope
i
understand
your
honor's
question...
texas
in
response
to
trimble
v.
gordon
made
two
amendments
to
42(b)
to
try
to
come
into
compliance.
mr.
paul
mc
collum
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
mc
collum
yes,
sir--
mr.
paul
mc
collum
--i
don't
think
she
could
have
after
1980,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
mc
collum
she
could
have
up
through
november
of
1980.
mr.
paul
mc
collum
yes,
your
honor.
she
could
have
pursued
the
law
as
it
existed.
now,
the
law
provides
three
ways
of
establishing
paternity,
one
of
which
is
not
to
ask
the
jury
do
you
find
that
she's
the
daughter
of
prince
ricker.
that
issue
was
ignored
by
everybody.
now,
counsel
was
there,
counsel
had
read
section
42(b).
it
did
not
vest.
in
other
words,
can
you
say
that
texas
in
trying
to
come
in
agreement
with
trimble,
that
a
person
can
sit
there
and
not
take
advantage
of
the
law
that
texas
passed--
mr.
paul
mc
collum
--no,
sir,
that's
the
law
they
chose
to
go
under.
that's
what
they
wanted
to
go
under.
mr.
paul
mc
collum
she
failed...
she
did
not
submit
any
evidence,
your
honor,
of
blood
tests.
she
did
not
try
to
come
in...
in
other
words,
texas
provided
a
method
that
she
could
have
been
declared
an
heir
of
prince
ricker,
a
paternal
heir
of
prince
ricker
if
she
could
have
prevailed
in
the
proof.
now,
all
in
the
world
she
had
to
do,
as
per
the
appellate
court
in
texas,
reed
v.
campbell,
said
all
in
the
world
she
had
to
do--
mr.
paul
mc
collum
--well,
yes,
sir,
take
the
blood
test
of
a
dead
man
or
samples
of
his
tissue.
we
don't
know
whether
it
would
have
been
possible,
but
on
the
other
hand,
we
do
know
that
she
never
tried,
and
all
in
the
world
they
have
got
to
do
is
try
to
comply
with
the
law,
and
that's
why
the
legislature
enacted
these.
they
are
reasonable
efforts
to
bar
spurious
claims
and
to
secure
accuracy
in
titles
and
accuracies
in
inheritance.
there
is
nothing
invidious
or
discriminatory
about
them.
the
law
was
in
place
for
her
to
establish
if
she
could
her
paternal
inheritance.
she
did
not
even
make
an
effort
to
do
so.
all
in
the
world
she
chose
to
do
was
to
say
am
i
the
child
of
prince
ricker,
which
was
a
nonissue
in
the
case.
now,
we
would
submit
that
we
don't
know
what
texas
could
have
done
to
come
into
compliance
with
trimble
other
than
what
she
did.
now,
would
texas,
would
the
statute,
would
section
42(b)
as
it
existed
in
1955
have
been
in
violation
of
trimble?
it
was
more
liberal
than
the
illinois
statute
which
required
not
only
intermarriage
but
also
a
formal
acknowledgement
of
the
child.
texas
tried
every
way
in
the
world
to
come
into
compliance
with
those
statutes.
now,
then,
are
we
to
say
that
while
in
court
in
1982
with
the
case
already
on
file
since
1978,
with
her
lawyers
and
not
make
an
effort
to
comply
with
the
law,
and
say,
well,
the
statute
has
run
on
me,
or
i
don't
like
the
law,
i
don't
think
the
legislature
was
proper
in
requiring
these
scientific
tests.
are
we
to
do
that?
i
would
respectfully
urge
the
court
that
there
is
a
complete
lack
of
substantiality
in
the
lawsuit.
we
do
not
find
in
the
lawsuit
anything
that
says
that
the
texas
laws
should
not
be
applicable
to
this
case.
texas
laws
are
presumed
to
take
effect
at
the
time
that
they
are
enacted,
and
these
did,
and
one
month
after
trimble
and
two
years
after
trimble
again,
both
while
she
was
in
court
and
able
to
take
full
advantage
of
them.
we
would
respectfully
urge,
your
honor,
that
in
this
case
the
appeal
should
be
dismissed.
thank
you.
