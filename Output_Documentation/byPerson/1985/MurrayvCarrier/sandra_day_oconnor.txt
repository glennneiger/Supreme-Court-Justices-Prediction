may
i
just
ask
one
point
about
that?
i
suppose
for
purposes
of
strickland,
we
look
at
the
effectiveness
of
counsel
for
the
trial
as
a
whole.
we
are
not
just
focusing
on
a
single
omission
or
error
at
one
point
in
the
trial.
we
look
at
the
whole
picture,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
for
the
cause
and
prejudice
inquiry
and
the
argument
you
are
making,
would
you
have
us
focus
on
the
performance
of
counsel
at
the
trial
as
a
whole,
or
would
you
concede
that
you
have
to
focus
on
this
specific
complaint,
this
one
alleged
error,
and
ask
if
it
was
ineffectiveness
in
that
narrower
focus
only,
some
kind
of
clear
failure
to
meet
a
reasonably
competent
standard
as
to
a
single
error?
i
am
confused.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
cohn,
now,
does
the
standard
the
fourth
circuit
applied
require
holding
a
hearing
in
every
case
that
a
habeas
petitioner
alleges
some
colorable
constitutional
claim
when
the
record
doesn't
show
why
the
attorney
acted
as
the
attorney
did?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
isn't
that
kind
of
an
unfortunate
standard
to
have
in
these
cases?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
fourth
circuit
test
does
seem
to
suggest
that
that
would
be
the
result,
and
i
just
wonder
if
that
is
in
keeping
with
what
justified
the
court's
holdings
in
wainwright
against
sykes
and
in
the
engel
case.
