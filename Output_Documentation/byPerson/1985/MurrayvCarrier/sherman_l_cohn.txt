mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
issue
before
this
court
is
really
quite
a
narrow
one,
the
meaning
of
the
word
"cause"
under
the
wainwright
versus
sykes
doctrine,
and
it
is
really
narrower
than
that.
justice
o'connor
referred
to
the
key
issue
in
this
case
in
her
question
in
the
first
few
moments
of
the
argument.
the
fourth
circuit's
decision
is
really
much
narrower
than
either
the
commonwealth
or
the
solicitor
general
would
make
it
out
to
be.
the
issue
that
was
stated
by
the
fourth
circuit,
and
this
is
on
page
8
of
the
appendix,
the
precise
issue
to
be
resolved
in
this
case
is
whether
carrier's
assertion
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
can
make
out
wainwright
cause.
what
we
have
here
is
not
a
question
of
mere
error,
mere
negligence.
what
we
have
here
is
the
fourth
circuit,
read
in
context
of
the
issue,
read
in
context
of
its
discussion
of
this
issue,
holding
that
the
performance
part
of
strickland,
holding
that
the
incompetency
argument
that
was
made
by
carrier
would
have
to
be
used
as
the
standard
to
see
whether
this
one
default,
this
single
glitch
met
the
performance
standard
that
strickland
lays
down.
this
can
be
seen
in
the
fourth
circuit's
opinion
in
the
appendix
at
the
bottom
of
page
11.
after
reviewing
a
series
of
cases,
the
fourth
circuit
said,
from
these
authorities
we
conclude
that
attorney
error
short
of
wholesale
ineffectiveness
of
counsel
can
constitute
wainwright
cause.
now,
i
would
like
to
posit
and
emphasize
that
word
"wholesale",
that
under
the
sixth
amendment,
we
are
looking,
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
to
the
overall
performance
in
the
case.
here,
the
fourth
circuit
said
we
are
looking
at
the
one
default
to
see
whether
it
met
the
performance
test
of
strickland.
the
court
goes
on.
a
procedural
default
is
excused
not
when
counsel
reasonably
but
incorrectly
exercised
his
judgment,
but
when
through
ignorance
or
oversight
he
fails
to
exercise
it
at
all
in
dereliction
of
the
duty
to
represent
her
client.
this
is
what
we
mean
by
attorney
error.
i
suggest
that
the
fourth
circuit
in
trying
to
find
the
midground
to
which
mr.
frey
referred
found
a
very
narrow
one
that
preserves
the
concept
of
cause
under
wainwright
versus
sykes
as
applied
to
attorney
conduct
or
misconduct.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
in
this
case--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
--in
this
case,
your
honor,
we
have
more
than
that.
we
have,
first
of
all,
that
the
default
is
clear.
secondly,
we
have
the
assertion
that
it
was
through
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
and
that
there
was
no
consultation.
putting
those
three
points
together,
i
suggest
that
the
lower
court
could
reasonably
determine
that
it
wanted
to
note
more.
i
am
not
saying
that
every
judge,
every
trial
judge
would
come
out
with
that
same
conclusion,
or
every
court
of
appeals
panel
would
come
out
with
the
same
conclusion.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
your
honor,
in
wainwright
versus
sykes
there
is
the
cause
prejudice
exception
to
the
procedural
bar.
i
would
assume
that
the
court
contemplated
that
it
has
some
meaning,
and
that
there
will
be
occasions
when
the
petitioner
is
going
to
allege
enough
to
go
on
to
the
next
stage,
which
is
the
possibility
of
a
factual
hearing.
that
factual
hearing
can
be
very
attenuated.
here
all
that
somebody
had
to
do,
i
would
suggest,
as
a
first
step
is
ask
counsel,
what
happened,
why.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
your
honor,
in
this
narrow
situation,
that
may
be
so,
but
it
is
deliberate
bypass
in
the
same
sense
that
the
chief
justice
pointed
out
in
jones
versus
barnes.
you
are
looking
for
counsel
exercise
of
the
minimum
skill
being
counsel,
and
as
the
fourth
circuit
says,
we
aren't
here
to
second
guess
judgments
made.
we
are
here
to
look
whether
judgment
was
made.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
as
jones
versus
barnes
points
out,
any
appellate
counsel
having
a
series
of
potential
issues
before
him
has
to
winnow
out
those
issues
that
he
considers
to
be
the
strongest.
that
is
an
exercise
of
judgment.
i
may
consider
that
a
particular
counsel
is
wrong
in
the
exercise
that
was
made,
and
here,
if
counsel
did
exercise
that
judgment,
the
counsel
has
met
the
minimum
competence
performance
test
of
the
first
prong
of
strickland.
on
the
other
hand,
if
there
is
any
other
explanation,
i
don't
know
what
it
would
be,
because
i
don't
know.
nor
did
the
court
of
appeals,
nor,
with
all
due
respect,
does
mr.
frey
know
what
happened
and
why
it
happened.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
well,
it
all
depends
on
your
meaning
of
ineffectiveness,
justice
blackmun.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
i
mean,
if--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
--if
you
mean
by
ineffectiveness
the
wholesale--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
--okay--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
--i
am
defending
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
as
i
believe
it
is
meant
in
a
narrow
holding.
there
is
language
within
the
opinion
that
one
could
take
out
of
context
and
read
differently,
and
the
commonwealth
and
the
solicitor
general
has
done
so.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
i
concede
that--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
--it
is
unnecessary
to
here
to
begin
with,
and
also,
once
we
get
to
the
question
of
mere
error,
whatever
that
may
mean,
i
have
difficulty
articulating
a
test.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
because
we
are
here
talking
about
not
ineffectiveness
as
an
independent
sixth
amendment
claim,
which
would
get
the
petitioner
complete
relief
in
its
own
mind.
instead,
we
are
looking
at
one
here,
one
incident,
and
we
want
to
under
the
cause
prong
of
the
sykes
case,
we
want
to
get
to
the
constitutional
issue
that
is
really
the
merits
of
the
petition.
in
order
to
do
that,
we
are
looking
at
the
competence
of
what
was
done,
and
i
am
talking
about
strickland
competence,
of
what
was
done
in
this
one
incident.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
justice
rehnquist,
the
cause
prong
of
sykes
as
construed
in
this
type
of
situation
only
gets
you
over
an
initial
hurdle.
there
is
still
the
entire
problem
of
prejudice.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
i
think,
your
honor,
that
somebody
would
have
to
take
a
look
at
those
notes.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that's
correct.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
we
have
sort
of
jostled
a
bit
between
counsel
as
to
whether
the
prejudice
test
under
sykes
and
the
prejudice
test
under
strickland
are
any
different,
and
we
have
each
tried
to
pick
out
the
language.
i
don't
think
that
that
is
clear
as
to--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
--if
there
is
one,
i
have
a
strong
difficulty
in
articulating
it.
so
it
may
very
well
end
up
that
there
is
no
difference
in
the
prejudice
prong,
but
we
aren't
there.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
it
makes
a
difference
in
this
sense,
justice
rehnquist,
that
under
sykes,
one
is
able
to
get
into
court,
show
cause,
and
get
to
the
constitutional
or
the
claimed
constitutional
violation,
and
if
that
is
prejudicial.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
i
don't
know
now--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
--but
in
order
to
determine
whether
that
is
prejudicial,
one
has
to
examine
the
documents
that
were
not
turned
over.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
and
i
don't
see
how
else
to
do
it.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
well,
your
honor,
that
is
what
this
court
spoke
about
in
sykes
and
in
engel.
footnotes
27
and
28
in
engel
speak
exactly
to
this
point,
that
there
is
a
difference
between
a
sykes
waiver
and
the
problem
of
exhaustion.
sykes
waiver
gets
you
into
federal
court.
the
cause
and
prejudice
end
of
it
is
the
entry
ticket,
if
you
will,
to
get
to
the
constitutional
claim,
and
that
is
an
entry
ticket
into
the
federal
court.
sykes
does
not
say,
engel
clearly
rejects
that
you
have
to
go
to
the
state
court
first.
moreover,
the
commonwealth
does
not
make
that
argument.
the
commonwealth
has
disavowed
in
its
reply
brief
that
one
has
to
go
to
the
state
court
to
prove
sykes
cause
at
the
bottom
of
page
14,
top
of
page
15.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
i
am
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
well,
it
seems
to
me
to
be
quite
bifurcated
to
say
that
under
sykes--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
--i
would
take
a
sixth
amendment
independent
violation
claim
to
state
court.
i
would
take
the
sykes
the
wainwright
versus
sykes
cause
prejudice
solely
to
federal
court,
and
that,
as
i
understand
it,
is
the
position
of
the
state
as
pointed
out
in
their
reply
brief
at
the
bottom
of
page
14
and
the
top
of
15,
where
the
state
says,
at
no
time
has
the
commonwealth
ever
advocated
that
carrier
must
return
to
state
court
so
that
the
state
courts
be
given
the
opportunity
to
determine
whether
he
can
demonstrate
sykes'
cause.
so,
it
is
a
position
that
the
commonwealth
does
not
urge
on
us.
instead,
they
urge
very
carefully
that
there
may
be
some
kind
of
a
cause
exception
under
virginia
law
to
the
virginia
procedural
bar.
they
urge
that
despite
the
clear
language
of
the
rule
that
there
is
none.
they
cite
no
case
that
so
holds.
the
one
case
that
they
do
cite
at
most
is
the
dictum
in
an
unreported
order.
and
i
am
not
even
clear
it
rises
to
that
dignity.
and
besides
that,
we
have
a
situation
here
where
the
man
came
to
the
state
court
with
his
claim,
and
he
said,
i
don't
know
how
to
put
this
in
proper
form.
give
me
counsel
so
that
i
can
put
my
habeas
claim
into
the
proper
form.
he
asked
for
it.
it
was
denied.
we
are
struggling
here
with
the
intricacies
of
state
cause
if
it
is
exists,
of
sykes
cause,
whatever
that
might
mean
in
this
context,
of
prejudice
in
this
context.
i
suggest
to
the
unlettered
pro
se,
the
petitioner
to
put
this
burden
on
him
without
help
is
quite
unrealistic.
there
was
a
state
habeas
review
here.
there
was
an
attempt
on
his
part
to
meet
whatever
procedural
hurdles
there
were.
give
me
counsel,
he
asked
for.
the
state
turned
him
down.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
i
think
what
counsel
would
have
done,
your
honor,
is
to
inquire
into
the
facts,
at
least
those
facts
that
weren't
under
seal,
and--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
--he
would
have
asked
the
appellate
counsel
on
direct
review
what
happened,
why
didn't
you
raise
that
issue.
he
would
have
had
more
facts
at
his
command
than
this
petitioner
had,
and
supposedly
counsel
would
be
better
able
to--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
--i
would
assume
so.
yes,
your
honor.
but
it
would
have
been
the
end
of
the
ball
game
upon
some
intelligent
knowing
of
facts,
and
that
is
what
this
case
is
about.
but
we
are...
i
would
assume
that
counsel
would
not
only
do
that,
out
would
have
a
better
idea
of
the
answers
to
these
arcane
questions
that
we
are
struggling
with
here
today
than
a
pro
se
litigant
would
have.
are
there
any
other
questions?
if
there
are
none,
i
submit.
