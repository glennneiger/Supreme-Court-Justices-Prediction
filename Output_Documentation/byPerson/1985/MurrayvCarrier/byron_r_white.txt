if
you
win
on
your
exhaustion
point,
what
has
to
be
exhausted?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
the
court
of
appeals
here
said
it
didn't
have
to
be
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
you
be
just
as
happy
if
we
said
that
momentary
lapse
of
counsel
is
not
cause?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
you
go
back
to
state
court
and
the
state
court
says,
well,
this
was
not
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
denied.
then
he
files
another
habeas
petition
and
says,
well,
it
may
not
have
been
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
but
it
was
cause,
just
like
you
said,
mr.
court
of
appeals,
or
the
district
court
said.
he
says
to
the
district
court,
the
court
of
appeals
held
this
lapse
was
cause,
so
give
me
the
writ.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right,
so
we
have
to
decide
that
as
well?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
counsel,
you
keep
saying
the
first
prong
of
strickland
would
be
met.
are
you
defending
the
court
of
appeals
judgment
that
cause
is
supplied
by
a
counsel,
a
lapse
of
counsel
short
of
ineffectiveness?
are
you
defending
that
or
not?
it
doesn't
sound
like
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
all
i--
justice
byron
r.
white
--the
court
of
appeals
said
it
didn't
need
to
amount
to
ineffectiveness
of
counsel.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
the
court
of
appeals
mean?
i
will
just
ask
you
again.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
defending
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
and
if
so,
tell
me
what
it
means?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
concede
that
reading
is
just
wrong.
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
you
just
don't
defend
that
language.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it
is
really...
if
the
issue
really
was
ineffectiveness
of
counsel,
why
shouldn't
you
have
to
exhaust
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
it
to
find
to
deal
with
prejudice
if
you
got
that
far.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
what
do
you
conceive
to
be
the
prejudice
inquiry
if
you
got
that
far
in
the
district
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
you
would
ask,
would
they
probably
have
made
a
difference
in
the
outcome
of
the
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
is
the
other
end
of
the
ineffectiveness
claim,
too,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
there
is
clearly
any
difference
between
them.
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
already
dealing
with
the
merits
of
that
claimed
constitutional
violation
in
this
case
when
you
deal
with
the
prejudice
angle,
i
would
think.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
the
claimed
violation
is
a
failure
to
turn
over
these
statements,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree
with
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
you
have
to
get
to
this
kind
of
a
question,
i
would
think
you
would
want
the
state
courts
to
deal
with
it
in
the
first
instance,
to
exhaust
it.
would
it
have
made
wouldn't
it
have
made
some
difference
in
the
outcome
of
the
trial?
isn't
that
something
that
state
courts
ought
to
look
at?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
were
talking
about
prejudice,
not
cause.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
would
you
solve
it,
taking
them
both
to
state
court
or
neither?
