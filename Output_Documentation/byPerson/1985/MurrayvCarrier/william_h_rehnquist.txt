is
there
a
claim
here
the
carrier
was
innocent?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
it
is
that
simple,
then
what
the
fourth
circuit
has
really
done,
isn't
it,
is
to
say
that
it
is
a
deliberate
bypass
test,
but
you
apply
it
to
the
lawyer
and
not
to
the
client.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
puts
a
premium
in
a
sense
on
knowledge
rather
than
judgment,
it
seems
to
me,
because
if
you
say
the
lawyer
knew
about
this
issue
but
decided
to
waive
it,
then
he
can't
make
anything
of
it,
whereas
it
might
have
been
just
terribly
bad
judgment
to
waive
it
even
though
he
knew
about
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
don't
have
to
meet
the
second
prong
of
strickland
in
showing
its
effect
on
the
outcome
of
the
trial
under
the
fourth
circuit's
view,
in
your
view,
i
take
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
there
is
no
difference
in
the
prejudice
prong,
does
it
really
make
any
sense
to
generate
this
middle
ground
and
have
a
new
body
of
doctrine
grow
up
about
it
if
really
it
isn't
going
to
make
a
whole
lot
of
difference
as
to
what
happens
to
the
habeas
petitioner
in
the
end?
