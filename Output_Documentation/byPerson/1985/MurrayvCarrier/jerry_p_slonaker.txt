mr.
jerry
p.
slonaker
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
presents
two
questions
the
resolution
of
which
will
have
a
profound
effect
on
habeas
corpus
litigation.
the
first
question
is
whether
attorney
error
resulting
or
flowing
from
inadvertence
or
ignorance
but
not
rising
to
the
level
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
constitutes
cause
under
sykes
to
excuse
a
procedural
defect.
the
second
question
is
whether
habeas
corpus
relief
can
be
obtained
from
the
federal
courts
by
asserting
attorney
error
was
caused
when
that
very
same
form
of
cause
is
recognized
in
the
form
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
by
a
state
court,
and
the
petitioner
has
never
presented
any
suggestion
of
ineffectiveness
to
the
state
court
to
determine
whether
that
court
may
excuse
the
default
and
address
the
merits.
i
realize
the
court
is
familiar
with
the
facts,
but
there
are
a
few
facts
i
want
to
mention
and
emphasize.
prior
to
carrier's
trial,
1977,
for
the
offense
of
rape
and
abduction,
and
again
during
the
trial,
his
defense
attorney
moved
for
discovery
of
the
victim's
statement
made
to
the
police.
the
prosecutor
took
the
position
that
the
statement
is
not
favorable
to
you,
so
you
are
not
entitled
to
receive
it,
but
i
am
entirely
willing
to
have
the
state
trial
judge
consider
it
in
camera.
judge
lamb
was
then
assigned
to
hear
the
case,
and
he
considered
it
in
camera.
at
the
request
of
the
defense
attorney
he
compared
that
statement
with
the
preliminary
hearing
testimony
of
the
victim,
looking
specifically
for
inconsistencies.
but
there
was
a
second
trial
judge
who
considered
the
statement.
judge
lamb
was
replaced
by
judge
owen.
when
the
discovery
request
was
renewed
at
trial,
judge
owen
reviewed
it
in
camera,
and
before
he
ruled
on
the
discovery
request,
he
listened
to
the
direct
examination
testimony
of
the
victim.
after
hearing
that,
he
denied
the
request,
finding
the
evidence
was
not
favorable
or
exculpatory
to
the
defendant.
the
next
factual
point
i
want
to
mention,
he
defaulted
on
appeal
in
the
sense
that
he
did
not
raise
a
discovery
claim
on
direct
appeal
although
he
had
assigned
it
among
many
other
errors
in
his
notice
of
appeal
filed
in
trial
court,
but
he
did
not
pursue
that
on
appeal.
about
one
year
after
the
direct
appeal
review
was
completed...
when
i
say
one
year
later,
i
am
including
the
denial
of
certiorari
by
this
court...
carrier
filed
a
pro
se
habeas
corpus
petition
in
the
state
court,
but
he
waited
almost
one
full
year.
he
alleged
his
discovery
claim.
the
commonwealth
moved
to
dismiss
that
petition,
saying
that
habeas
corpus
is
not
substitute
for
direct
appeal.
you
could
have
asserted
your
claim
on
direct
appeal
and
did
not,
but
we
didn't
leave
it
there.
we
said
you
are
foreclosed
from
having
it
considered
on
habeas
corpus
under
virginia
law
in
the
absence
of
additional
allegations
explaining
the
default.
carrier
proffered
none.
after
the
state
habeas
proceedings
were
completed,
including
the
appellate
review
of
the
dismissal
of
his
petition
for
the
reasons
stated
in
the
commonwealth's
motion
to
dismiss--
mr.
jerry
p.
slonaker
--yes.
mr.
jerry
p.
slonaker
that
is
correct.
mr.
jerry
p.
slonaker
at
that
time
it
was
required
that
your
issues
be
assigned
in
the
notice
of
appeal.
now,
that
is
no
longer
virginia
law,
but
it
is
significant--
mr.
jerry
p.
slonaker
--he
did
that.
mr.
jerry
p.
slonaker
and
that
is
the
first
step
toward
having
appellate
review,
but
that
is
only
the
initial
step.
typically
what
defense
attorneys
do...
i
am
sure
this
is
true
in
other
jurisdictions--
mr.
jerry
p.
slonaker
--no,
sir,
not
at
all.
mr.
jerry
p.
slonaker
the
failure
to
brief
that
issue
means
that
the
issue
is
lost,
because
only
claims
that
are
pursued--
mr.
jerry
p.
slonaker
--waived
or
defaulted,
so
it
cannot
be
considered.
the
first
issue,
as
attorney
error
is
caused,
the
commonwealth
is
not
suggesting
that
if
an
egregious
trial
error
is
omitted
by
defense
counsel
such
that
a
miscarriage
of
justice
might
result
or
would
result,
or
that
a
fair
trial
would
be
denied,
that
relief
should
not
be
granted.
of
course
it
should
be
granted
and
it
would
be
granted
by
showing
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
for
not
pursuing
that
claim.
if
you
can't
show
your
attorney
was
ineffective
for
admitting
the
claim,
surely
the
claim
is
not
sufficient
to
establish
a
denial
of
a
fair
trial.
that
is
the
purpose
of
the
federal
habeas
review
anyway,
is
to
determine
whether
the
petitioner
receives
a
fair
trial.
there
is
no
magic
in
the
fact
that
there
is
to
be
federal
review.
that
is
the
essence
of
the
review.
this
court
has
already
set
the
proper
standard
in
the
strickland
case
to
determine
the
effectiveness
of
counsel,
reasonably
effective
assistance.
it
is
a
workable
standard.
it
is
a
flexible
standard.
and
it
is
a
time-tested
standard,
but
unlike--
mr.
jerry
p.
slonaker
--i
realize,
justice
o'connor--
mr.
jerry
p.
slonaker
--i
believe
you
would
look
in
both
cases
at
the
whole
performance,
but
the
focus
in
each
instance
would
be
on
the
specific
default
or
defect
or
deficiency
of
the
attorney.
i
think
a
good
example
of
this
might
be
the
stokes
case,
which
we
cite
in
our
opening
brief,
where
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
found
that
an
attorney
was
ineffective
for
not
raising
a
sandstrom
defective
instruction.
now,
that
doesn't
mean
you
don't
look
at
his
performance
overall.
in
this
context,
on
appeal,
surely
the
court
would
look
to
what
issues
he
did
raise,
the
relevant
merit,
so
it
really
wouldn't
be
in
isolation.
you
don't
ignore
what
else
was
done,
but
the
focus
would
be
on
the
particular
deficiency
as
it
would
be
in
any
allegation
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
but
the
standard...
i
mentioned
the
stokes
case,
and
why
i
think
this
is
so
significant.
the
stokes
case,
where
the
virginia
supreme
court
found
the
attorney
was
ineffective,
would
have
been
wholly
bypassed,
that
is,
the
state
courts
would
have
been
wholly
bypassed
in
that
situation
under
the
carrier
rule
of
the
fourth
circuit
if
prisoner
stokes
had
elected
to
go
directly
to
federal
court.
all
he
would
have
had
to
do
was
go
to
the
district
court,
allege
his
defective
instruction,
and
assert
as
cause
that
he
had
attorney
error.
under
the
fourth
circuit's
rule,
there
would
be
no
requirement
to
exhaust
state
remedies
because
it
is
only
a
cause
question.
the
state
court
would
have
been
bypassed,
would
have
had
no
opportunity
to
address
that
problem.
this
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
difficulty
with
the
fourth
circuit's
analysis.
mr.
jerry
p.
slonaker
yes,
justice
stevens.
that
is
correct.
mr.
jerry
p.
slonaker
no,
sir,
i
think
it
is
their
practice
to
look
at
the
issues
asserted
in
the
petition
for
appeal,
because
the
virginia
rule
says
that
if
you
don't
assert
them
or
pursue
them
in
the
petition
for
appeal,
then
they
are
not
considered,
so
i
don't
think
the
court
would
look
at
errors
assigned
in
the
notice.
i
think
they
would
look
to
the
errors
set
forth
in
the
petition
for
appeal.
mr.
jerry
p.
slonaker
actually,
it
is
not
a
discretionary
review.
it
is
discretionary
in
the
sense
the
defendant
is
not
entitled
to
have
a
writ
of
error,
but
in
the
case
of
saunders
versus
reynolds,
which
is
found
in
volume
204
of
the
southeastern
second
reports,
the
virginia
supreme
court
said
there
is
a
single
criterion
for
denying
or
granting
a
writ
of
error,
and
that
is
the
merits
of
the
case,
so
it
is
a
merits
determination,
unlike
certiorari
with
this
court,
where
you
have
any
number
of
considerations.
so
it
is
in
my
judgment
an
appeal
of
right
within
the
meaning
of
evitts
versus
lucey.
it
would
be
not
discretionary
in
that
sense.
the
rule
of
the
fourth
circuit,
i
submit,
is
going
to
send
the
wrong
signals
to
defense
attorneys.
what
it
is
going
to
tell
them
is,
you
don't
have
to
be
careful.
the
pressure
is
off.
ignorance
is
bliss.
because
if
you
overlook
something,
if
it
is
inadvertent,
the
question
can
always
be
reviewed
in
federal
habeas
corpus.
it
is
just
the
wrong
signals.
mr.
jerry
p.
slonaker
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
as
i
was
saying
at
the
luncheon
break,
even
if
this
court
accepts
our
position
on
the
exhaustive
question,
and
we
fervently
hope
the
court
will,
acceptance
of
the
fourth
circuit's
rule
will
put
enormous
pressure
on
the
state
courts
to
lower
their
standards,
to
accept
mere
attorney
error
and
inadvertence
as
an
excuse
for
serious
procedural
defaults
or
face
the
alternative
of
simply
deferring
the
federal
court
without
providing
the
federal
court
the
benefit
of
either
state
factual
findings
or
the
benefit
of
the
state
court's
reasoning.
surely
this
court
would
not
accept
on
a
routine
basis
attorney
error
or
inadvertence
as
an
excuse
for
such
defaults.
and
i
submit
the
state
court
should
not
be
required
to
do
that
either.
the
role
of
the
fourth
circuit's
rule
in
practical
application
is
going
to
cause
less
significant
issues
to
occupy
the
attention
of
the
federal
courts.
and
it
will
undercut
the
very
healthy
role
of
the
state
default
rules
of
motivating
counsel
to
emphasize
the
important
issues.
there
are
a
number
of
serious
problems
with
the
fourth
circuit's
role,
among
them
the
very
unfair
distinctions
that
it
draws.
first,
if
you
object...
i
mean,
if
the
object
is
fairness,
if
that
is
the
purpose,
the
fourth
circuit
rule
just
doesn't
make
any
sense.
why
have
a
special
test
that
if
the
attorney
doesn't
object
to
something,
he
omits
the
objections,
then
we
will
excuse
that
on
the
basis
of
attorney
error,
but
if
he
doesn't
call
an
alibi
witness,
which
can
be
even
more
prejudicial
to
the
defendant,
he
has
to
show
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
the
strickland
standard
would
apply.
that
is
just
an
arbitrary
and
irrational
distinction.
mr.
jerry
p.
slonaker
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
opinion,
justice
stevens,
that
would
limit
their
reasoning
to
the
appellate
default.
mr.
jerry
p.
slonaker
i
don't
think
it
would
avoid
the
problems
that
i
am
discussing,
because
i
think--
mr.
jerry
p.
slonaker
--yes,
as
far
as
the
type
of
default,
yes,
on
overlooking
an
issue.
that
is
true.
but
i
think
that
it
wouldn't
provide
guidance
then
for
the
many
issues
that
would
arise
in
the
trial
context,
but
yes,
i
would
agree
that
this
court
could
limit
it,
and
that
would
be
somewhat
helpful
if
it
at
least
went
that
far.
mr.
jerry
p.
slonaker
i
am
not
sure
that
i
am
following.
i
am
saying
that
if
you
are
accepting
the
fourth
circuit's
rule--
mr.
jerry
p.
slonaker
--i
think
that
would
be
devastating,
because
it
would
have
the
same
problem
of
allowing...
taking
the
pressure
off
counsel
not
to
focus
on
the
most
important
questions,
not
to
carefully
analyze
the
possible
issues
on
appeal.
mr.
jerry
p.
slonaker
justice
stevens,
i
submit
that
if
the
attorney
makes
an
admission
that
would
result
in
a
defendant
who
is
innocent
going
free,
he
would
have
no
difficulty
establishing
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
if
indeed
the
default
flowed
from
attorney
error.
that
is
our
position.
mr.
jerry
p.
slonaker
there
is
no
claim
the
carrier
was
innocent.
in
fact,
the
evidence
was
overwhelming
in
this
case,
just
absolutely
overwhelming.
the
other
difficulties
with
the
fourth
circuit's
task
is
the
fact
that
this
court
has
recognized
in
numerous
decisions
without
any
question
that
a
defendant
is
bound
by
the
tactical
decisions
of
his
lawyer,
yet
the
defendant
under
the
fourth
circuit's
approach
who
has
the
attentive
lawyer
is
bound,
whereas
the
defendant
who
has
the
inattentive
lawyer
would
not
be
bound.
this
places
a
premium
on
ignorance.
as
far
as
the
evidence,
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
that
point.
as
i
said,
the
evidence
was
overwhelming.
the
defendant
was
positively
identified
by
the
victim,
positively
identified
by
an
independent
witness,
a
mr.
barko,
who
observed
the
two
together
shortly
before
the
offense.
the
victim
was...
there
is
a
positive
identification
by
this
third
witness
of
both
the
victim
and
the
perpetrator
when
he
saw
them
together.
there
was
physical
evidence
found
at
the
defendant's
house
that
tied
him
into
the
offense.
the
victim
identified
the
truck
and
unique
details.
there
was
a
shoe
print
of
the
defendant
found
at
the
rape
scene.
so
i
won't
go
into
all
of
the
evidence.
there
was
evidence
of
blood
typing
that
matched
the
defendant
and
put
him
in
a
20
to
30
percent
population
grouping,
so
the
evidence
was
truly
overwhelming
in
this
case.
the
fourth
circuit's
approach
trivializes
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
most
federal
circuits,
i
think,
recognize
that
because
they
have
rejected
that
approach,
and
not
a
single
federal
circuit
has
accepted
the
fourth
circuit's
rule
since
engel
versus
isaac
was
decided,
and
that
is
really
for
good
reason,
because
the
strickland
test
is
not
going
to
result
in
any
denial
of
due
process,
but
acceptance
of
the
fourth
circuit's
rule
is
going
to
afford
the
defendant
undue
process.
we
submit
that
is
not
appropriate.
i
would
like
to
save
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jerry
p.
slonaker
it
is
our
position
that
he
should
return
to
the
state
court
to
present
his
allegation
of
cause
that
he
suffered
attorney
deficiency.
virginia
recognizes
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
as
cause
for
that
deficiency.
mr.
jerry
p.
slonaker
that
is
true,
but
this
is
the
problem
with
not
requiring
exhaustion.
in
other
words,
he
could
always
bypass
the
state
court,
because
if
he
can't
show
mere
attorney
error,
he
certainly
can't
show
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
so
unless
we
are
going
to
have
a
bypass
of
the
state
system,
surely
if
the
type
of
cause
is
specifically
recognized
under
state
law,
so
that
there
wouldn't
even
be
a
default,
there
wouldn't
even
be
a
sykes
problem,
it
is
fair
to
require
him
to
return.
the
american
civil
liberties
union
in
their
amicus
brief
have
acknowledged
that
if
there
is
a
state
remedy,
they
see
no
reason--
mr.
jerry
p.
slonaker
--no,
we
wouldn't
be
as
happy
because
we
think
the
state
court
should
have
the
opportunity
to
make
that
assessment
of
whether...
in
other
words,
if
you
are
going
to
say
that
under
all
circumstances--
mr.
jerry
p.
slonaker
--well,
that
is
why
i
think
it
is
essential
that
this
court
find
that
it
has
got
to
rise
to
the
level
of
ineffective
assistance.
mr.
jerry
p.
slonaker
i
think
you
do.
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
you
do.
i
would
like
to
reserve...
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
jerry
p.
slonaker
no,
sir.
i
am
saying
that
if
he
makes
that
decision,
and
that
decision
is
within
the
range
of
competence
demanded
of
attorneys
under
strickland,
he
would
be
bound.
mr.
jerry
p.
slonaker
but
if
he
does
not
pass
that
test
he
would
not
be
bound.
mr.
jerry
p.
slonaker
no,
sir,
that
would
be--
mr.
jerry
p.
slonaker
--the
prosecutor
would
be
equally
bound.
in
fact,
he
would
be
more
bound
by
his
mistakes.
mr.
jerry
p.
slonaker
yes,
there
is
a
case
in
virginia,
rice
versus
commonwealth,
where
the
commonwealth
attempted
to
challenge
a
state
statute
for
the
first
time
on
appeal,
and
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
held
that
they
would
not
entertain
the
question.
that
is
in
212
virginia.
would
not
entertain
the
question
because
the
commonwealth
had
not
raised
the
objection
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
jerry
p.
slonaker
there
was
no
consideration
given
to
the
harmless
error
doctrine.
mr.
jerry
p.
slonaker
i
am
not
certain
i
understand
your
question,
justice
marshall.
mr.
jerry
p.
slonaker
yes,
sir,
many
situations--
mr.
jerry
p.
slonaker
--where
a
prosecutor
has
been
guilty
of
misconduct
and
it
has
not
been
found
to
be
a
harmless
error?
mr.
jerry
p.
slonaker
see,
a
commonwealth
has
no
right
to
appeal
in
virginia,
so
we
are
not
in
the
posture...
we
have
no
right
to
appeal
except
in
revenue
cases.
i
don't
know
if
a
revenue
case
has
ever
arisen
in
the
last
10,
20,
or
30
years.
there
just...
there
is
no
context
for
that
to
arise.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
jerry
p.
slonaker
nothing
further,
your
honor.
