justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
again
to
get
one
thing
straight
in
my
mind
before
lunch
comes?
under
virginia
practice,
as
i
understand
it,
he
asserted
this
error
in
his
notice
of
appeal
but
not
in
the
petition
for
appeal.
so
there
are
two
separate
documents.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
virginia
supreme
court
doesn't
write
an
opinion,
they
just
say...
it
is
a
little
one-paragraph
disposition
finding
no
reversible
error
in
the
judgments
complained
of.
they
refused
the
petition
for
appeal.
is
it
their
practice
to
look
at
both
documents
or
just
to
look
at
one?
do
we
know?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
this
a
typical
disposition
of
a
criminal
case
where
they
don't
write
an
opinion
even
identifying
the
errors
they
considered?
i
mean,
it
is
sort
of
a
discretionary
review,
sort
of
like
our
cert
grant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
do
you
interpret
the
court
of
appeals...
the
fourth
circuit
opinion
as
applying
to
trial
error
as
well
as
error
on
appeal?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
we
might
possibly
limit
the
holding
in
this
court
and
then
avoid
some
of
the
problems
that
you
are
discussing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
examples
you
gave
were
trial...
errors
at
the
trial
level.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
harm
would
the
rule
cause
if
we
did
so
limit
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
applying
only
to
error
on
appeal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
do
with
the
problem
then?
assume
you
have
a
lawyer
who
is
not
totally
incompetent,
but
just
through
negligence
completely
misses
the
point,
and
an
innocent
man
is
therefore
denied
review?
you
just
say
that
is
too
bad?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
frey,
doesn't
justice
marshall's
example,
just
like
this
case,
say
that
you
really...
how
can
you
answer
without
knowing
what
the
jenks
act
material
is,
or
how
can
you
answer
this
question
without
seeing
the
file?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
your
view,
does
the
strength
of
the
claim
have
any
effect
on
the
analysis,
or
do
we
treat
all
the
claims
alike?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
rule
would
apply,
because
justice
rehnquist
raised
it
earlier.
even
if
this
undisclosed
material
would
in
fact
show
the
man
to
be
innocent,
it
would
still
be
the
same
rule.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
cohn,
may
i
interrupt
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
having
a
little
trouble
following
the
significance
of
the
failure
to
provide
counsel.
supposing
you
had
been
appointed
counsel
for
him
at
that
stage.
could
you
have
drafted
a
better
state
habeas
corpus
petition
that
he
drafted
himself?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
would
he
have
gotten
them?
the
prosecutor
says,
i
don't
have
to
turn
them
over
to
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
counsel
had
said,
well,
i
only
had
figure
my
experience
in
the
virginia
supreme
court
is,
they
don't
ever
grant
review
if
you
plead
too
many
points.
i
took
my
three
best.
i
knew
this
error
was
there
but
i
thought
the
trial
judge
was
probably
right
when
he
looked
at
it
and
he
found
no
exculpatory
material.
i
just
thought
these
were
the
three
stronger
points.
that
would
just
be
the
end
of
the
ball
game?
