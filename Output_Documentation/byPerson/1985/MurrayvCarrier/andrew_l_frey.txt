mr.
andrew
l.
frey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
begin
by
describing
what
our
position
is
with
respect
to
attorney
oversights.
our
position
is
not
that
attorney
oversight
can
under
some
circumstances
be
cause.
our
position
is
that
if
the
defendant
is
alleging
attorney
error
as
a
basis
for
relief,
he
must
satisfy
the
strickland
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
the
cause
and
prejudice
test,
we
believe,
applies
to
something
external
to
the
defense,
something,
an
outside
circumstance
that
has
justified
the
defendant's
failure
to
raise
or
preserve
his
claim.
now,
this
does
not
mean,
contrary
to
the
suggestion
that
i
think
the
aclu
and
respondent
have
made
that
nothing
can
be
cause
under
the
cause
and
prejudice
test.
quite
the
contrary.
first
of
all,
there
are
situations
where
the
court
may
refuse
to
allow
a
motion
or
objection
to
be
made.
the
state
may
have
a
rule
which
unreasonably
conditions
or
interferes
with
the
ability
to
make
or
preserve
a
claim,
or
in
the
more
common
situation
there
will
be
an
inability
to
discover
through
reasonable
diligence
the
factual
or
legal
basis
for
the
claim
at
the
time
when
the
rules
call
for
it
to
be
made.
now,
an
example
of
that
is
the
united
states
against
henry,
a
messiah
case
this
court
decided
a
few
years
ago
in
which
the
messiah
claim
was
raised
for
the
first
time
in
collateral
attack.
we
did
not
argue
there
that
there
was
a
procedural
default
in
failing
to
raise
at
a
trial,
because
the
fact
that
the
cellmate
was
a
government
informant
was
unknown
prior
to
trial.
now,
so
our
position
is
that
in
order
to
get
relief
on
the
basis
of
a
claim
which
was
procedurally
defaulted
at
trial
or
on
appeal
on
the
basis
of
attorney
error
the
defendant
must
satisfy
the
strickland
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
standard.
now,
what
are
the
alternatives
to
this
position?
one
alternative
was
the
view
expressed
in
fay
against
noia
and
in
justice
brennan's
dissent
in
wainwright
against
sykes.
and
that
is
that
a
procedural
default
should
bar
a
claim
only
if
the
defendant
is
somehow
personally
responsible
for
it,
and
this
view
is
based
on
the
notion
that
it
is
not
fair
to
hold
the
client
responsible
for
the
errors
of
his
attorney.
now,
under
this
view,
procedural
defaults
would
rarely
be
enforced,
but
i
think
there
is
little
question
that
this
view
was
rejected
by
the
court
in
wainwright
and
again
rejected
in
engel.
now,
what
has
happened
in
this
case
is
a
search
for
an
intermediate
position
by
the
court
of
appeals,
and
under
this
position
as
i
understand
it
the
client's
personal
waiver
is
not
required,
but
he
is
still
not
to
be
bound
by
his
lawyer's
action
unless
in
effect
the
lawyer
deliberately
waived
the
right
by
choosing
not
to
raise
an
issue
of
which
the
lawyer
was
aware.
now,
it
seems
to
me
there
are
several
reasons
for
rejecting
this
effort.
first
of
all,
i
think
it
is
quite
clear
that
this
can't
be
squared
with
engel.
there
is
language
in
engel
versus
isaacs
that
unequivocally
talks
about
the
lawyer
overlooking
a
claim,
the
lawyer's
unawareness
of
the
claim,
and
makes
it
quite
clear
that
that
is
not
cause
to
excuse
a
procedural
default.
now,
there
is
another
problem.
i
am
not
sure
that
i
totally
understand
what
the
fourth
circuit's
test
is.
it
seems
to
me
clear
in
this
case
that
what
happened
is
that
the
lawyer
in
his
assignment
of
error
listed
everything
he
could
think
of,
and
then
when
he
got
around
to
preparing
the
petition
for
appeal,
selected
from
among
those
things
the
issues
that
were
thought
most
likely
to
gain
the
attention
of
the
virginia
supreme
court,
discarding
others.
nevertheless,
the
court
of
appeals
here
reversed,
and
in
fact
it
suggested
that
almost
surely
this
was
the
kind
of
attorney
error
that
would
constitute
cause,
but
it
did
send
it
back
for
a
hearing.
now,
what
is
the
situation
in
the
case
where
the
attorney
considers
he
is
aware
of
the
potential
existence
of
a
claim
but
decides
that
it
is
not
sufficiently
meritorious
to
be
pressed?
is
that
under
the
fourth
circuit's
test
going
to
be
a
waiver
of
the
claim,
or
is
it
not
going
to
be
a
waiver
of
the
claim?
now,
if
that
is
going
to
be
an
excusable
default
in
that
case
where
a
legal
error
causes
the
lawyer
to
choose
not
to
press
a
claim,
then
we
will
be
back
essentially
to
fay
against
noia,
and
the
cause
and
prejudice
standard
of
wainwright
will
be
pretty
much
wiped
out
in
any
case
where
the
lawyer
has
failed
to
preserve
the
claim.
i
don't
think
the
fourth
circuit
meant
to
go
that
far.
i
think
what
the
fourth
circuit
meant
to
say
was,
well,
if
the
lawyer
doesn't
realize
the
claim
exists,
that
is
cause.
if
the
lawyer
realizes
the
claim
exists
but
chooses
through
a
legal
mistake
not
to
press
it,
that
is
not
cause.
now,
in
our
mind
this
creates
a
totally
irrational
system
for
deciding
what
constitutes
cause
and
what
doesn't
constitute
cause,
and
in
thinking
about
it
i
have
come
up
with
a
little
parable
to
try
to
illustrate
this.
long
ago
there
was
a
kingdom
in
which
the
king
liked
to
hold
cooking
contests,
and
every
week
he
would
have
a
contest,
and
in
this
particular
week
he
decided
to
have
an
apple
pie
baking
contest.
and
all
the
nobility
participated,
and
there
were
two
noblemen
who
sent
their
cooks
out
to
make
apple
pies
and
submitted
a
pie
to
the
contest,
and
they
were
denied
any
award
in
the
contest
because
there
were
no
apples
in
the
pie.
the
king
said,
sorry,
no
apples
in
the
pie,
you
can't
get
any
prize.
well,
this
was
a
litigious
country,
and
they
filed
suit,
claiming
that
they
were
entitled
to
this
prize,
and
they
each
brought
in
their
cooks,
and
one
cook
said,
i
didn't
realize
there
weren't
any
apple
trees
in
the
garden.
it
is
true,
there
was
one
there,
but
i
just
didn't
realize
it.
and
the
other
cook
said,
i
knew
there
was
an
apple
tree,
and
i
went
out
there,
but
i
didn't
think
my
ladder
was
tall
enough
to
reach
the
apples.
now,
under
the
fourth
circuit's
result,
one
of
those
noblemen
is
entitled
to
the
prize
and
one
of
them
is
not,
because
in
one
case
the
cook
was
unaware
there
was
an
apple
tree.
in
the
other
case,
the
cook
wrongly
thought
he
couldn't
reach
the
apple
tree
with
his
ladder.
now,
to
come
back
to
our
defendants
here,
what
difference
does
it
make
to
the
defendant,
what
difference
does
it
make
to
an
equitable
resolution
of
this
problem
whether
the
lawyer
failed
to
recognize
that
there
was
a
claim
or
recognizing
that
there
was
a
claim
erroneously
failed
to
recognize
that
the
claim
had
legal
merit?
it
seems
to
me
this
is
a
completely
unworkable
standard.
now,
it
is
not
only
unworkable,
but
i
think
it
totally
undermines
what
the
court
accomplished
in
strickland.
strickland
is
really...
can
fairly
be
viewed
also
as
a
procedural
default
case.
the
claim
in
strickland
was,
my
lawyer
failed
to
put
on
evidence.
i
would
like
another
hearing
at
which
evidence
that
tends
to
be
exculpatory
or
minimize
my
culpability
and
justifies
a
lighter
sentence
can
be
put
on.
the
state's
answer
to
that
essentially
is,
no,
you
have
failed
through
the
exercise
of
due
diligence
to
put
on
evidence
that
was
available
to
you.
you
have
defaulted.
you
don't
have
the
right
to
come
back
and
have
another
hearing.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
essentially
the
claim
in
strickland
is
not
different
in
character
from
the
claim
in
this
case.
in
both
instances,
there
is
a
failing
by
the
lawyer,
a
default
or
a
claim
of
default
by
the
lawyer.
again,
in
strickland,
the
court
labored,
pondered
the
question,
and
decided
that
the
way
to
deal
with
these
feelings
yes?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
all
right.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
don't
think
that
the--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
i
can't
answer
your
question
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
that
you
have
supplied
me
applying
the
strickland
standard.
first
of
all,
i
don't
think
the
strickland
standard
looks
to
the
subjective
state
of
mind
of
the
defendant,
and
i
would
point
out
that
one
of
the
problems
with
the
fourth
circuit
standard
is
that
it
requires
you
to
bring
the
lawyer
in
and
ask
him,
well,
did
you
hear
about
jenks,
have
you
heard
about
brady,
what
do
you
think
it
means,
why
did
you
or
didn't
you
make
your
claim?
in
your
case,
you
would
have
to
look
at
whether
a
reasonable
competent
attorney
under
the
circumstances
would
clearly
have
asked
for
it,
and
then
you
would
also
have
to
look
at
how
important
the...
material
is.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i...
i
might.
but
i
would
have
to
know
more
about
the
rest
of
the
case.
i
would
have
to
know
how
important
the
undisclosed
jenks
material
was
to
the
overall
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
to
do
away
with
the
procedural
default
doctrine
altogether,
because
the
premise
of
all
of
these
situations
is
that
the
defendant
had
a
meritorious
claim
which
he
has
lost.
otherwise
there
is
no
point
in
worrying
about
whether
there
is
a
cause
or
not.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
know
that
your
view
was
that
the
strength
of
the
claim
would,
and
i
think
the
strength
of
the
claim
would
have
relevance
under
the
strickland
standard.
it
would
be
part
of
the
determination,
but
i
think
under
the
cause
and
prejudice
analysis,
if
you
were
going
to
go
that
route,
i
don't
think
it
would.
that
is--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
i
would
have
to
say
in
answer
to
your
question
again
that
the
premise
always
is
that
he
would
prevail.
if
he
hadn't
defaulted,
he
would
have
prevailed
either
in
state
court
or
in
federal
habeas
proceeding.
so
i
suppose
that
is
true.
there
is,
of
course,
the
remedy
of
executive
clemency
where
it
is
demonstrated,
and
that
is
an
available
remedy.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
excuse
me?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
my
understanding
is,
the
two
trial
judges
did
examine
this,
yes.
thank
you.
