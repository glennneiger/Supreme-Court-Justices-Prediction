on
that
same
point,
as
i
understand
your
position,
if
counsel
makes
a
choice
not
to
raise
a
point
in
either
the
lower
court
or
the
federal
court,
that
is
just
too
bad,
because
it
is
charged
to
the
defendant.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
would
be
bound.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
the
prosecutor
violates
his
principles,
then
that
is
harmless
error.
you
don't
charge
that
to
the
state.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
they
are
both
lawyers.
the
defense
counsel
and
the
prosecutor
are
both
lawyers.
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
you
give
me
a
case
where
they
didn't
find
harmless
error?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
they
say...
was
the
harmless
error
point
raised?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
was
the
kind
of
case
i
was
talking
about.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
a
case
in
virginia
where
a
prosecutor
violated
a
rule
and
it
wasn't
declared
to
be
harmless
error?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
let
me
try
one.
justice
thurgood
marshall
tried
in
the
federal
criminal
court,
and
claim
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
and
the
only
claim
is
that
the
counsel
did
not
ask
for
jenks
act
material.
and
his
response
is,
who
is
jenks?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
that
be
ineffective?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
after
you
look
at
all
of
that,
would
you
find
him
anything?
