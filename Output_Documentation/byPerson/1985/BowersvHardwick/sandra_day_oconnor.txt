but,
on
its
face,
the
statute
would
permit
such
a
prosecution,
would
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
tribe,
how
do
you
propose
that
these
other
situations
be
analyzed,
by
some
sort
of
heightened
scrutiny
as
well,
and
are
you
suggesting
that
there
is
a
more
compelling
state
interest
or
what
is
it
you
are
saying?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
tribe,
under
your
analysis
what
sort
of
explanation
would
be
required?
you
suggested
that
if
the
state
were
to
assert
its
desire
to
promote
traditional
families
instead
of
homosexual
relationships
would
not
suffice
in
your
view
and
yet
that
is
an
articulate...
potentially
articulate
reason.
perhaps
the
state
can
say
its
desire
to
deter
the
spread
of
a
communicable
disease
or
something
of
that
sort.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
what
suffices
here?
