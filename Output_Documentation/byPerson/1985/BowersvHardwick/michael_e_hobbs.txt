mr.
michael
e.
hobbs
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
a
fundamental
right
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
to
engage
in
consensual
private
homosexual
sodomy.
in
1982,
michael
hardwick
was
arrested
and
charged
with
the
violation
of
georgia's
anti-sodomy
statute
for
engaging
in
this
conduct
with
a
consenting
adult
in
his
home.
the
case
was
never
presented
to
the
grand
jury
of
fulton
county
and
no
prosecution
of
mr.
hardwick
ensued.
however,
in
1983,
mr.
hardwick,
along
with
john
and
mary
doe,
filed
a
section
1983
suit
seeking
injunctive
relief
and
declaratory
relief
against
the
enforcement
of
georgia's
sodomy
statute.
mr.
michael
e.
hobbs
your
honor,
the
district
attorney
of
fulton
county,
who
would
have
handled
that
case--
mr.
michael
e.
hobbs
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
--indicated
that
it
would
not
be
presented
the
grand
jury
under
further
evidence
developed.
that
is
the
only
reason
that
i
know
that
it
was
not
presented.
mr.
michael
e.
hobbs
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
hobbs
yes,
your
honor,
the
statute
is
enforced
in
georgia.
mr.
michael
e.
hobbs
i
could
not
tell
the
court
that.
i
can
only
say
that
in
our
experience
the
statute
is
most
frequently
enforced
in
situations
where
the
conduct
takes
place
in
more
public
or
quasi-public
areas.
mr.
michael
e.
hobbs
it
had
been
enforced.
i
believe
that
last
case
i
can
recall
was
back
in
the
1930's
or
40's
in
the
state
of
georgia.
appellate
decisions.
obviously,
your
honor,
the
fourth
amendment
impedes
the
ability
of
the
state
of
georgia
to
enforce
the
statute
when
the
conduct
takes
place
in
the
privacy
of
the
home.
nevertheless,
it
is
our
position
that
the
fourth
amendment
restrictions
should
not
have
any
bearing
on
whether
or
not
there
is
a
fundamental
right
to
engage
in
this
conduct.
mr.
michael
e.
hobbs
the
last
reported
appellate
decision
concerning
this
type
of
conduct
in
a
private
setting.
mr.
michael
e.
hobbs
not
to
my
knowledge.
not
in
the
state
of
georgia
at
least.
mr.
michael
e.
hobbs
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
statute
does
not
differentiate
between
married
individuals,
unmarried
heterosexuals
or
homosexuals.
it
is
our
position
that
there
is
no
fundamental
right
to
engage
in
this
conduct
and
that
the
state
of
georgia
should
not
be
required
to
show
a
compelling
state
interest
to
prohibit
this
conduct.
there
is
certainly
textual
support
for
this
proposition.
and,
contrary
to
the
views
expressed
by
the
eleventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
the
respondent,
it
is
suggested
that
there
is
no
precedential
support
in
the
decision
of
this
court
for
the
proposition
that
there
is
a
fundamental
right
to
engage
in
sexual
relationships
outside
of
the
bonds
of
marriage.
this
court
in
the
carey
decision
in
1976
made
it
fairly
explicit
that
its
previous
decisions
relating
to
contraception
and
abortion
were
restricted
to
state
regulations
which
burden
an
individual's
choice
to
prevent
conception
or
to
terminate
pregnancy.
and,
the
court
concluded
that
it
was
not
holding
a
state
must
show
a
compelling
state
interest
every
time
sexual
freedom
is
involved.
in
moore
versus
city
of
east
cleveland,
justice
powell
noted
the
difficulty
this
court
has
sometimes
had
in
defining
fundamental
rights
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
suggested,
based
upon
numerous
cases
of
this
court,
that
appropriate
limits
and
guidelines
for
determining
whether
or
not
rights
are
truly
fundamental
can
be
found
in
the
tradition,
history,
and
heritage
of
this
nation.
in
that
particular
case,
justice
powell,
writing
for
the
plurality,
concluded
that
the
constitution
protects
the
family
simply
because
the
family
is
so
rooted
in
the
history
and
traditions
of
our
nation.
many
of
this
court's
decisions
have
followed
the
history
and
traditions
of
our
nation
in
making
its
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
a
particular
activity
is
entitled
to
constitutional
protection
as
a
fundamental
right.
thus
far
this
court
has
concluded
that
the
right
of
privacy
includes
matters
which
involve
marriage
and
family,
procreation,
abortion,
child
rearing
and
child
education.
it
has
never
concluded,
and
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
there
is
no
constitutional
warrant
to
conclude
that
there
should
be
a
fundamental
right
to
engage
in
homosexual
sodomy
or
any
other
type
of
extra-marital
sexual
relationships.
the
common
thread
of
this
court's--
mr.
michael
e.
hobbs
--if
your
honor
please--
mr.
michael
e.
hobbs
--i
believe
in
light
of
griswold
versus
connecticut
that
application
of
the
statute
to
a
married
couple
would
make
it
very
problematic
for
the
state
of
georgia
to--
mr.
michael
e.
hobbs
--i
believe
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
michael
e.
hobbs
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
e.
hobbs
the
right
of
marital
privacy
as
identified
by
the
court
in
griswold.
mr.
michael
e.
hobbs
yes,
your
honor,
based
upon
this
court's
findings
in
griswold
versus
connecticut
in
which
justice
douglas
stated
the
right
of
marital
intimacy
is
older
than
our
bill
of
right.
it
harkens
back
to
the
heritage
of--
mr.
michael
e.
hobbs
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
court
has
previously
described
fundamental
rights,
whether
they
be
under
the
general
heading
of
a
right
of
privacy
or
other
fundamental
rights,
is
those
which
are
so
rooted
in
the
conscience
of
our
people
as
to
be
truly
fundamental.
principles
of
liberty
and
justice
which
lie
at
the
base
of
our
civil
and
political
institutions,
privileges
which
have
long
been
recognized,
a
common
law
as
essential
to
the
orderly
pursuit
of
happiness
by
free
men.
the
simple
fact
is
that
homosexual
sodomy,
which
is
what
is
involved
in
this
case,
has
never
in
our
heritage
held
a
place--
mr.
michael
e.
hobbs
--the
record,
i
believe,
your
honor...
the
complaint
indicated
that
mr.
hardwick
was
arrested
for
engaging
in
sodomitic
act
with
another
male.
mr.
michael
e.
hobbs
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
this
is
a
review
of
a
dismissal
of
a
section
<nineteen
eighty-three>
[=
1983]
lawsuit
and
under
that
dismissal
we
are
bound
by
the
allegations
contained
in
the
complaint.
our
legal
history
and
our
social
traditions
have
condemned
this
conduct
uniformly
for
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
years.
as
late
as
1979
in
the
palm
versus
hughes
case
this
court
indicated
that
it
is
neither
illogical
nor
unjust
for
society
to
express
its
condemnation
of
irresponsible
liaisons
outside
of
the
bonds
of
marriage.
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
the
respondent
and
the
eleventh
circuit
have
posed
no
reason
to
distinguish
the
rationale
of
that
decision.
nor
should
the
conduct
be
considered
fundamental
protected
by
the
constitution
merely
because
it
might
take
place
in
the
home.
the
eleventh
circuit
and
the
respondents
rely
heavily
upon
this
decision
in
payton
versus
new
york
and
in
stanley
versus
georgia.
of
course,
payton
was
a
fourth
amendment
case
involving
the
physical
intrusion
of
individuals
of
the
state
into
a
person's
home.
this
is
not
a
fourth
amendment
case.
the
fourth
amendment
does
not...
while
it
does
provide
a
general
right
of
privacy
concerning
the
home,
it
does
not
prevent
the
state
from
enacting
regulations
which
govern
activities
in
the
home.
mr.
michael
e.
hobbs
that
is
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
the
four
amendment,
as
this
court
has
held,
protects
two
types
of
expectations,
searches
and
seizures,
and
those
expectations
are
not
involved
in
the
questions
presented
to
the
court
today.
stanley
versus
georgia,
which
is
relied
on
most
heavily
by
the
respondent,
is
also,
i
would
submit,
inapplicable
to
this
situation,
for
in
stanley
this
court
found
that
there
was
an
underlying
right,
a
fundamental
right
under
the
first
amendment,
to
freedom
to
receive
information
and
ideas
and
it
was
that
right
which
was
being
infringed
upon
when
georgia
attempted
to
prosecute
mr.
stanley
for
the
private
possession
of
pornographic
materials.
this
case
does
not
involve
any
such
underlying
right.
in
order
for
stanley
to
be
applicable,
i
would
submit
to
the
court,
this
court
must
find
first
that
there
is
a
fundamental
right
to
engage
in
homosexual
sodomy.
moreover,
stanley
has
been
limited
to
its
facts
by
this
court
and
united
states
versus
12
200-foot
reels
of
film,
wherein
this
court
decided
that
stanley
was
a
line
of
demarcation,
that
the
court
would
go
thus
far
but
not
beyond
and
limited
stanley
strictly
to
the
facts
of
that
particular
case.
concededly
there
are
certain
kinds
of
highly
personal
relationships
which
are
entitled
to
heightened
sanctuary
from
the
state
and
intrusion.
the
respondents
would
urge,
and
the
eleventh
circuit
has
concluded,
that
the
relationship
involved
in
this
case
is
entitled
to
constitutional
protection
as
a
fundamental
right
under
the
right
of
intimate
association.
only
a
limited
number
of
associations
and
relationships
have
been
found
by
this
court
to
be
entitled
to
constitutional
protection,
those
that
attend
marriage,
the
family,
raising
children,
and
cohabitation
with
one's
relatives.
this
court
has
described
those
relationships
as
personal
bonds
which
have
played
a
critical
role
in
the
culture
and
traditions
of
the
nation
by
cultivating
and
transmitting
shared
ideals
and
beliefs.
mr.
michael
e.
hobbs
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
[laughter]
i
was
referring,
of
course,
to
this
court's
decision
in
moore
versus
east
cleveland.
this
description,
i
would
submit
to
the
court,
does
not
apply
to
the
conduct
which
is
prescribed
by
georgia's
sodomy
statute.
respondent
and
some
amici
in
this
case
have
argued
that
perhaps
the
definition
of
the
family
should
be
changed
so
as
to
be
extended
to
homosexuals
and
other
types
of
relationships
which
have
not
been
recognized
in
our
society
thus
far
so
as
to
accommodate
the
conduct
which
is
prohibited
and
elevated
to
a
constitutional
status.
mr.
michael
e.
hobbs
well,
your
honor,
to
be
quite
frank,
i
do
not
know
what
was
in
the
mind
of
the
district
attorney
when
he
decided
not
to
prosecute
this
case.
mr.
michael
e.
hobbs
in
terms
of
prosecuting
mr.
hardwick?
mr.
michael
e.
hobbs
because
at
the
time,
your
honor,
we
relied
heavily,
almost
exclusively
on
this
court's
decision
in
doe
versus
commonwealth's
attorney.
the
state
of
georgia
was
in
this
case
by
virtue
of
the
declaratory
judgment
action
and
it
was
decided
that
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
1983
lawsuit
should
be
found
based
upon
this
court's
decision
in
doe
versus
commonwealth's
attorney.
mr.
michael
e.
hobbs
well,
i
think--
mr.
michael
e.
hobbs
--i
think
that
most
certainly
the
state
does
have
an
interest
in
enforcing
the
statute
and
in
maintaining
the
statute
on
our
books.
as
i
have
indicated,
the
fourth
amendment
makes
the
enforcement
of
this
statute
very
difficult,
but
the
statute
also--
mr.
michael
e.
hobbs
--perhaps
so.
mr.
michael
e.
hobbs
i
would
agree,
your
honor.
we
are,
however,
bound
by
the
record
as
it
is
presented
to
the
court
and
i
am
wary
of
going
beyond
the
record
to
explain
other
evidence.
the
respondent,
as
i
was
saying,
and
some
amici
have
urged
that
the
relationship
of
the
family
should
be
redefined
and
this
is
one
of
the
interests
that
the
state
of
georgia
is
most
concerned
about.
we
are
very
concerned
that
there
is
a
potential,
should
the
eleventh
circuit's
decision
be
upheld,
for
a
reshuffling
of
our
society,
for
a
reordering
of
our
society.
as
this
court
indicated
in
roe
versus
wade,
the
right
of
privacy
is
not
limited.
it
is
not
absolute,
pardon
me.
there
must
be
limits
and
it
is
submitted
that
in
finding
these
limits
we
must
be
wary
of
creating
a
regime
in
the
name
of
a
constitutional
right
which
is
little
more
than
one
of
self-gratification
and
indulgence.
the
constitution
must
remain
a
charter
of
tolerance
for
individual
liberty.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that.
but,
it
must
not
become
an
instrument
for
a
change
in
the
social
order.
the
respondents
have
made
a
crack-in-the-door
argument
that
if
the
eleventh
circuit's
decision
is
affirmed
in
this
case
it
will
not
go
beyond
consensual
private
homosexual
sodomy;
that
it
is
submitted
that
this
crack-in-the-door
argument
is
truly
a
pandora's
box
for
i
believe
that
if
the
eleventh
circuit's
decision
is
affirmed
that
this
court
will
quite
soon
be
confronted
with
questions
concerning
the
legitimacy
of
statutes
which
prohibit
polygamy,
homosexual,
same-sex
marriage,
consensual
incest,
prostitution,
fornication,
adultery,
and
possibly
even
personal
possession
in
private
of
illegal
drugs.
moral
issues
and
social
issues,
it
is
submitted
to
the
court,
should
be
decided
by
the
people
of
this
nation.
laws
which
are
written
concerning
those
issues
are
rescinded
concerning
those
issues
should
be
by
the
representatives
of
those
people.
otherwise,
the
natural
order
of
the
public
debate
and
the
formulation
of
consensus
concerning
these
issues,
it
is
submitted,
would
be
interrupted
and
misshapen.
it
is
the
right
of
the
nation
and
of
the
states
to
maintain
a
decent
society,
representing
the
collective
moral
aspirations
of
the
people.
the
eleventh
circuit
and
respondents
in
this
case,
by
failing
to
adhere
to
the
traditions,
the
history
of
this
nation
and
the
collective
conscience
of
our
people,
would
remove
from
this
area
of
legitimate
state
concern,
a
most
important
function
of
government
and
possibly
make
each
individual
a
law
unto
himself.
it
is
submitted
to
this
court
that
this
is
not
the
balance
that
our
forefathers
intended
between
individual
liberties
and
legitimate
state
legislative
prerogatives.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
hobbs
the
state
of
georgia
is
not
acting
as
big
brother
in
this
particular
case.
it
is
adhering
to
centuries-old
tradition
and
the
conventional
morality
of
its
people.
certainly,
it
cannot
invade
the
privacy
of
the
home
and
regulate
each
intimate
activity
which
takes
place
there.
each
statute
enacted
by
any
state
must
be
rationally
related
to
a
legitimate
government
purpose
and
it
is
submitted
most
respectfully
to
mr.
tribe
that
this
statute
is
related
to
the
legitimate
purpose
of
maintaining
a
decent
and
moral
society.
it
is
inherently
intertwined
with
the
state's
concern
with
the
moral
soundness
of
its
people.
just
a
couple
of
comments.
the
state
of
georgia
in
its
official
code
does
have
a
general
severability
statute
and
that
should
bear
on
the
issue
here
before
the
court.
in
summary,
the
liberty
that
exists
under
our
constitution
is
not
unrestrained.
it
is
ordered
liberty,
it
is
not
licentiousness.
if
the
eleventh
circuit's
decision
is
affirmed
in
this
case,
the
state
of
georgia
and
other
states
will
be
impeded
for
making
those
distinctions
between
true
liberty
ordered
liberty,
and
licentiousness.
thank
you
very
much,
mr.
chief
justice.
