mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
about
the
limits
of
governmental
power.
the
power
that
the
state
of
georgia
invoked
to
arrest
michael
hardwick
in
the
bedroom
of
his
own
home
is
not
a
power
to
preserve
public
decorum.
it
is
not
a
power
to
protect
children
in
public
or
in
private.
it
is
not
a
power
to
control
commerce
or
to
outlaw
the
infliction
of
physical
harm
or
to
forbid
a
breach
in
a
state
sanctioned
relationship
such
as
marriage
or,
indeed,
to
regulate
the
term
of
a
state
sanctioned
relationship
through
laws
against
polygamy
or
bigamy
or
incest.
the
power
invoked
here,
and
i
think
we
must
be
clear
about
it,
is
the
power
to
dictate
in
the
most
intimate
and,
indeed,
i
must
say,
embarrassing
detail
how
every
adult,
married
or
unmarried,
in
every
bedroom
in
georgia
will
behave
in
the
closest
and
most
intimate
personal
association
with
another
adult.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
yes.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
justice
powell,
i
think
there
are
two
kinds
of
limiting
principles.
the
first
relates
to
the
place.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
the
place
where
the
acts
occur.
in
stanley
versus
georgia,
this
court
suggested
that
the
mere
possession
and
enjoyment
of
obscenity
at
home
is
quite
different
from
other
supposedly
private
places.
and,
in
the
fourth
amendment
area,
the
court
has
faced
the
problem
of
defining
what
is
a
home.
it
said,
for
example,
a
mobile
home
may
not
qualify.
we
think
that
wherever
that
line
is
drawn
that
a
private
home
such
as
this
represents
the
repository
of
constitutional
traditions
under
the
third
and
fourth
amendments.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it
seems
to
us
that
the
private
home
does
not
shield
anything
that
one
might
do
there.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
state's
power
to
regulate
the
terms
of
relationships,
just
as
it
regulates
the
terms
of
contracts,
includes
the
power
to
punish
a
breach
of
contract
in
a
home,
it
can
certainly
punish
adultery,
wherever
it
occurs,
without--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--no,
not
quite.
i
think
it
is
somewhat
broader
to
be
candid,
justice
powell.
i
think
it
includes
all
physical,
sexual
intimacies
of
a
kind
that
are
not
demonstrably
physically
harmful
that
are
consensual
and
non-commercial
in
the
privacy
of
the
home.
indeed,
mr.
hobbs
said
that
under
his
theory
state
should
be
able,
without
providing
a
compelling
justification,
to
punish...
his
words
were
"irresponsible
liaison"
outside
the
bonds
of
marriage.
so,
imagine
for
a
moment
an
ordinance
or
a
statute
that
says
unmarried
couples
may
hold
hands
and
they
may
perhaps
embrace
lightly,
but
extended
caresses
or
kissing
with
the
mouth
is
forbidden.
now,
in
their
theory,
even
if
this
occurs
in
the
home,
under
their
theory
as
long
as
the
state
says
the
majority
of
our
legislators
disapprove
of
this
conduct
and,
indeed,
there
is
a
long
history
of
disapproving
things
that
might
lead
to
greater
intimacies
among
unmarried
people,
we
can
outlaw
it,
not
just
outlaw
it,
but
we
can
resist
a
request
for
more
particularized
explanation
of
why.
when
justice
stevens
asked,
what
is
the
public
interest
after
all,
why
is
it
to
so
great,
you
don't
even
want
to
prosecute
him
in
this
clear
case
of
violation,
i
think
you
will
notice
that
mr.
hobbs
retreated
to
generalities.
what
we
suggest
is
that
when
the
state
asserts
the
power
to
dictate
the
details
of
intimacies
in
what
they
call
irresponsible
liaison,
even
in
the
privacy
of
the
home,
that
it
has
a
burden
to
justify
its
law
through
some
form
of
tightened
scrutiny.
in
your
concurring
opinion,
justice
powell,
in
kelly
versus
johnson
when
you
suggested
that
a
regulation
on
the
length
of
hair
if
applied
across
the
board
to
all
citizens,
unlike
that
case
which
was
just
the
police,
would
involve
an
important
personal
liberty
interest,
would
require
a
balancing
of
state
interest
against
personal
interest,
and
cited
the
harlan
dissent
in
poe
v.
ullman,
i
think
what
you
recognized
in
that
case
and
what
i
would
stress
here
is
that
when
a
state's
assertion
of
power
over
liberty
occurs
at
the
intersection
of
intimate
personal
association,
which
this
court
has
recognized
in
a
half-century
of
cases,
and
the
privacy
of
the
home
in
the
clearest
possible
sense,
then
there
must
be
at
least
heightened
scrutiny
rather
than
the
unquestioning
deference
that
the
state
of
georgia
would
request.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
yes.
mr.
chief
justice,
as
to
incest,
it
seems
to
me
quite
apart
from
problems
about
offspring
and
whatever
genetic
evidence
there
might
be.
but,
the
state's
power
to
define
the
terms
of
relationships
and
to
limit
potential
exploitation
surely
includes
the
power
in
the
employee/employer
context
to
say
that
a
parent
consents
to
sex
is
not
real.
in
a
parent/child
context
to
say
that
a--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
doubt,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
state
would
have
to
assume
that
just
because
a
woman
is
over
21,
that
if
her
father
induces
her
to
have
sex,
that
that
has
got
to
be
consensual.
we
think
a
state
can
assume
that
there
are
certain
relationships
in
the
context
of
which,
even
if
both
people
are
adults,
in
the
context
of
which
consent,
because
of
the
power
structure
of
the
relationship,
may
just
be
an
illusion,
but
there
is
nothing
about
this
law
that
limits
it
to
cases
where
consent
is
questionable
or
where
there
is
some
other
relationship
between
the
parties
that
makes
this
other
than
completely
consensual
intimacy.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
the
edmonds
act--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--no,
i
think,
justice
rehnquist,
that
cohabitation
by
one
already
married
could
be
punished
by
the
state
as
a
breach
of
a
state
sanctioned
relationship.
if
the
state
can
punish
inducement
of
breach
of
contract
in
other
cases,
if
the
state
can
say
that
when
people
have
made
a
solemn
bond,
a
bond
of
status
as
well
as
contract,
that
it
cannot
be
broken,
i
would
think
that
laws
against
cohabitation
and
bigamy,
wherever
practiced,
at
least
raise
a
different
and
far
more
difficult
question
than
that
here,
because
here
the
state
is
not
saying
that
mr.
hardwick
was
violating
some
relationship.
the
complaint,
indeed,
said
nothing
about
the
relationship
between
mr.
hardwick
and
the
other
person,
male
or
female.
it
just
says
that
because
the
majority
of
us
disapprove
morally,
we
have
the
power,
we,
the
state
of
georgia,
have
the
power
to
punish
it
and
make
it
a
crime.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think,
justice
o'connor,
there
are
two
approaches,
either
of
which
would
lead
to
the
same
result.
one
is
that
the
recognized
power
of
the
state
to
protect
children
and
to
protect
relationships
and
to
prevent
harmful
conduct
is
such
that
it
would
be
pointless
to
require
heightened
scrutiny
any
more
than
this
court
does
of
the
minimum
wage
laws
or
other
laws
regulating
special
relationships,
therefore,
minimum
rationality
would
suffice.
the
other
approach
would
be
to
say
that
if
it
is
in
the
privacy
of
the
home,
scrutiny
should
be
somewhat
heightened,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
very
easy
for
the
state
to
show
compelling
justification
and
a
compelling
interest.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
either
event
the
holding
of
the
eleventh
circuit,
which
is
that
in
cases
of
this
kind
where
a
law
reaches
sweepingly
to
all
consensual
intimacy
in
the
privacy
of
the
home,
without
drawing
any
of
the
lines
that
a
legislature
might
draw
to
deal
with
these
problems--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--certainly,
justice
powell.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
certainly.
we
would
say
that
in--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--we
think
that
a
hotel
overnight
is
not
entitled
to
the
same
degree
of
protection,
but,
frankly,
i
do
not
know
precisely
where
the
line
would
be
drawn.
for
fourth
amendment
purposes,
hotel
room
overnight
gets
full
protection.
but,
when
this
court
decided
in
payton
that
one
needs
a
warrant
to
enter
a
private
home
even
with
probable
cause,
it
is
not
clear
to
me
that
that
decision
which
reflected,
as
your
concurring
opinion
in
rakas
did,
the
sense
that
there
is
something
special
about
a
home,
would
automatically
extend
to
a
hotel
room.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
justice
powell,
i
have
been
troubled
by
parts
of
the
harlan
dissent
in
moore
which
rather
casually
mentioned
homosexuality,
and
for
that
matter
abortion,
in
much
the
same
breath.
the
actual
language
that
i
think
is
operative
at
page
552
of
the
harlan
dissent
is
that
he
would
not
suggest...
he
says
that
"adultery,
homosexuality,
fornication
and
incest
are
immune
from
criminal
inquiry
however
privately
practiced.
"
we
are
not
arguing
for
absolute
immunity.
we
are
arguing
for
heightened
scrutiny.
the
eleventh
circuit
only
held
that
when
a
law
of
this
kind
is
challenged
because
of
its
intrusive
invasion
of
personal
liberty
at
the
intersection
of
intimate
association,
on
the
one
hand,
and
the
privacy
of
the
home
on
the
other,
the
state
must
do
more
than
appeal
to
the
tautology
that
a
majority
of
its
legislators
has
approved.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
would
think,
justice
stevens,
first,
that
if
they
did
that,
strict
or
substantially
heightened
scrutiny
would
be
required.
second,
i
think
that
when
the
state
makes
the
argument
that
it
is
necessary
to
illegalize
extra-marital,
completely
non-marital
sexual
relations
in
order
to
put
marriage
on
a
pedestal,
that
under
heightened
scrutiny
that
argument
would
emerge
rather
dubious,
the
cause/effect
relationship
extremely
dubious,
as
in
carey
and
as
in
griswold
when
the
argument
was
we
want
to
outlaw
contraceptives
because
indirectly
that
will
make--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--exactly,
justice
stevens.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
would
say--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--if
that
argument
were
made
on
remand,
but
if
the
court
were
to
agree
that
heightened
scrutiny
is
appropriate,
it
would
certainly
be
a
legitimate
argument
for
the
state
to
advance,
unlike
the
tautology
it
advances
here,
we
outlaw
it
because
we
don't
like
it,
we
think
it
is
immoral.
it
would
be
a
legitimate
argument,
that
this
is
a
properly
tailored
means
of
encouraging
marriage.
i
would
then
submit
that
one
would
have
responses
along
the
line
of
boddie
v.
connecticut,
the
right
not
to
be
married.
it
would
then
be
a
more
finely
tuned
inquiry
into
whether
the
state's
intrusion
into
so
personal
and
intimate
and
private
a
realm
was
really
a
rationally,
reasonably
tailored
means
of
achieving
that
end
and
i
frankly
doubt
that
it
could
be
sustained.
but,
at
least
the
state
would
not
be
asking
for
the
utterly
opaque
and
unquestioned
deference
that
it
seeks
in
a
case
of
this
kind
where
it
says
that
because
the
majority
for
a
long
time
has
disapproved
of
this
conduct,
we
can
make
it
a
triumph.
if
history
alone
were
the
guide...
surely,
i
have
to
conceded
that
the
framers
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
perhaps
justice
harlan
25
years
ago
would
have
been
prepared
to
assume
that
the
kinds
of
sexual
intimacies
involved
in
this
case
would
be
outlawed.
but,
then
the
framers
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
assumed
that
the
kinds
of
sexual...
given
the
constitutional
protection
in
reed
v.
reed
and
in
frantiero
and
in
stanton
versus
stanton
and
in
hogan
v.
mississippi
university
for
women
also
could
be
outlawed.
the
law
that
they
assumed
would
apply
is
the
law
that
kept
myra
bradwell
from
being
a
lawyer--
but,
as
this
court
recognized
in
loving
against
virginia,
where
also
a
majority
of
the
people
of
virginia
believed
that
interracial
liaisons
were
inherently
immoral
and
where
for
a
long
time
a
lot
of
people
had
believed
that,
this
court
did
not
think
that
the
constitution's
mission
was
to
freeze
that
historical
vision
into
place.
justice
harlan's
dissenting
opinion
in
poe
v.
ullman
recognized
the
evolutionary
character
of
the
definition
of
those
intimacies
that
are
protected.
and,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
hardly
be
a
suitable
role
for
any
court
to
decide
its
own
catalogue
of
protected
intimacies.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
justice
rehnquist,
we
do
think
that
that
trend
is
at
least
relevant
for
the
question
of
whether
this
is
self-evidently
evil.
but,
this
court
has
never
before
held
that
when
a
personal
right
protected
by
the
constitution,
just
because
those
persons
might
be
able
to
obtain
political
redress,
the
right
no
longer
deserves
judicial
protection.
indeed,
in
justice
powell's
dissent
in
garcia,
the
suggestion
was
made
that
surely
this
court
would
never
say
as
to
individual
rights
that
the
ability
of
individuals
to
possibly
persuade
a
legislature
to
protect
them
is
enough.
in
stanley
v.
georgia,
another
case
where
georgia
wanted
to
impose
its
morality
on
the
privacy
of
the
home,
the
argument
could
have
also
been
made
most
states
have
legalized
private
possession
of
pornography.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
do
not
think
that
if
this
case
had
been
squarely
presented
before
justice
harlan
that
he
would
have
decided
to
draw
the
line
based
on
which
body
parts
come
into
contact.
i
think
he
would
have
recognized
that
the
power
of
the
state
in
a
case
properly
presented,
the
power
of
the
state
to
have
its
own
catalogue
of
how
you
can
touch
someone
else
in
the
privacy
of
the
home
is
limited.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no,
i
don't
think
justice
harlan
was
capable
of
fits
of
absent-mindedness.
but,
this
court's
doctrine
about
advisory
opinions
recognizes
that
even
the
best
justices
are
at
their
best
when
they
have
a
genuine
case
or
controversy
before
them.
and,
i
do
think
that
we
have
one
here.
i
want
to
make
some
comment
about
the
suggestion
implicit
in
some
of
the
questions,
that
the
absence
of
frequent
prosecution
in
cases
like
this,
apart
from
how
strongly
it
suggests
the
state
of
georgia
hardly
has
a
compelling
or
important
interest
in
vindicating
this
law,
might
also
provide
an
avenue
for
avoiding
a
decision
much
as
the
court
found
one
in
poe
versus
ullman.
it
does
not
seem
to
me
that
that
avenue
is
a
plausible
one
here
for
several
reasons.
after
all,
mr.
hartwick
was
arrested.
under
this
very
arrest,
he
could
still
be
prosecuted.
under
this
arrest,
he
is
subject
to
considerable
restraint.
and,
the
state's
undisputed
resolve
to
enforce
this
law,
at
least
in
some
instances,
according
to
their
own
catalogue
of
where
they
think
it
is
appropriate
to
enforce
it
if
evidence
comes
to
their
attention.
that
resolve
is
undiminished,
especially
since
this
is
a
facial
attack
on
the
law.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
nature
of
the
harm
that
mr.
hardwick
suffers
from
having
been
arrested
and
being
told
he
is
a
criminal
and
might
be
arrested
again
makes
it
very
difficult
to
avoid
decisions.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
i
suppose
with
every
facial
attack,
justice
rehnquist,
there
is
some
definition
of
the
relevant
universe.
there
is
no
suggestion,
for
instance,
that
the
part
of
this
law
which
involves
aggravated
sodomy
is
under
attack.
the
argument,
however,
is
that
this
law
in
its
sweeping
definition
of
intimacies
in
the
home
is
unconstitutional
and--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that
is
correct.
we
don't
rely
on
peculiarities
of
the
facts
here,
but
we
do
say
that
it
is
only
in
the
context
of
the
home
that
the
very
powerful
confluence
of
rights
represented
by
the
home
and
intimacy
are
involved.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
if
you
want
to
call
it
something
else,
that
is
not
a
problem.
in
any
event,
it
is
important,
i
think,
to
recognize
that
he
is
not
identifying
something
about
his
situation
relevantly
different
from
that
of
a
married
couple
that
might
be
prosecuted
and
saying
that
the
law
perhaps
protects
them
but
not
me,
but
i
am
invoking
their
rights.
the
argument
he
makes
is
that
regulation
of
sexual
intimacy
in
the
privacy
of
the
home
by
a
law
this
sweeping
is
subject
to
heightened
scrutiny
and
there
is
no
severability
clause
in
this
law
as
there
wasn't
in
carey
or
zablocki.
this
is
not,
for
example,
one
of
the
five
states
that
outlaws
sodomy
only
between
people
of
the
same
sex.
so,
it
seems
to
us
that
what
is
before
the
court
quite
clearly
is
the
power
of
georgia
asserted
through
this
statute
to
criminalize
without
explanation
beyond
the
tautological
invocation
of
the
majority
morality.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
the
liberty
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
justice
white,
as
given
further
meaning
an
content
by
a
force
of
decisions
over
half
a
century.
we
think
that
as
to
the
home
the
third
and
fourth
amendment--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
we
think
with
respect
to
the
home
dimension
we
rely
heavily
on
stanley,
where
the
idea
that
it
was
a
first
amendment
right
surely
will
not
wash
because,
as
the
court
held,
and,
indeed,
the
very
case
they
cite,
12
200-foot
reels,
there
is
no
right
to
buy
the
material,
no
right
to
sell
it,
no
right
to
show
it
to
consenting
adults
in
public,
only
a
right
to
enjoy
it
in
private.
with
respect
to
the
intimacy
dimension,
we
rely
heavily
on
griswold
and
on
eisenstadt
to
show
that
griswold
cannot
be
limited
to
married
couples.
and,
with
respect
to
both,
we
rely
on
the
fundamental
principle
recognized
in
the
concurring
opinion
in
kelly
v.
johnson
that
important
intrusions
upon
liberty
are
not
to
be
upheld
on
a
form
of
review
so
differential
though
it
might
be
appropriate
in
regimented
context
such
as
the
policy
or
military.
this
court
has
never
held
it
appropriate
in
dealing
with
all
citizens
in
the
privacy
of
their
home.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
justice
white,
i
think
that
the
method
that
this
court
used
in
both
griswold
and
in
roe
of
looking
to
tradition
in
terms
of
the
protection
of
the
place
where
an
act
occurs
and
of
looking
to
a
tradition
in
terms
of
recognizing
autonomous
personal
control
over
intimacy
is
an
appropriate
process
to
employ.
it
seems
to
us
that
it
is
easier
using
that
process
to
conclude
that
this
case
implicates
a
fundamental
right
and
even
to
conclude
it
in
moore
v.
east
cleveland,
because
as
the
tradition
of
family
is...
in
your
dissenting
opinion
in
moore,
i
think
it
was
an
important
point
that
it
was
not
necessarily
so
crucial
a
matter
for
the
society
to
ensure
the
right
of
grandmothers
to
choose
exactly
which
grandchildren
to
live
with.
now,
i
think
myself
the
majority
was
right
in
that
case.
but,
whatever
you
think
about
moore,
the
long
line
of
opinions
cannot
in
any
principled
way
be
cut
off
at
the
particular
triangle
of
rights
in
which
the
state
of
georgia
would
try
to
encase
this
court's
precedents,
marriage,
family,
and
procreation.
if
the
entire
line
of
decisions
is
not
to
be
repudiated
root
and
branch,
it
has
to
stand
for
some
generalizable
principle
of
the
kind
that
the
majority
opinion
in
the
jaycees
case
endorsed
where
the
court
expressly
rejected
the
idea
of
a
methodology
that
would
proceed
by
specific
categories
unmentioned
in
the
constitution
like
marriage
and
family
and
in
favor
of
the
more
functional
approach
that
would
look
to
the
distinctively
personal
aspects
of
life
that
are
being
regulated
in
settings
distinguished,
as
the
court
put
it,
by
solace,
selectivity
and
seclusion.
now,
if
liberty
means
anything
in
our
constitution,
especially
given
the
ninth
amendment's
proposition
that
it
is
not
all
expressly
enumerated,
if
liberty
means
anything
it
means
that
the
power
of
government
is
limited
in
a
way
that
requires
an
articulated
rationale
by
government
for
an
intrusion
on
freedom
as
personal
as
this.
it
is
not
a
characteristic
of
governments
devoted
to
liberty
that
they
proclaim
the
unquestioned
authority
of
big
brother
dictate
every
detail
of
intimate
life
in
the
home.
what
sense
would
it
make
to
say
that
the
government
cannot
order
its
regiments
in
the
home,
if
it
could
regiment
every
detail
of
life
in
the
home.
what
sense
does
it
make
to
use
the
apparatus
of
the
fourth
amendment
with
the
controversial
exclusionary
rule
to
protect
the
privacy
of
the
home
if
the
constitution
is
insensitive
to
the
substantive
privacies
of
the
life
within
the
home?
it
seems
to
us
that
if
the
protections
of
the
third
and
fourth
amendments
are
not
to
be
reduced
to
error
and
empty
formalisms,
that
they
have
to
reflect
an
underlying
principle,
a
principle
not
unlike
that
which
this
court
recognized
in
decisions
like
meyer
and
pierce
and
more
recently
in
moore
v.
east
cleveland.
those
underlying
principles,
i
think
it
is
important
to
stress,
do
not
place
on
a
constitutional
pedestal
as
though
receiving
this
court's
particular
approval,
the
particular
acts
involved
in
a
case
like
this.
i
think
in
that
sense
it
is
misleading
to
say
that
we
are
championing
a
fundamental
right
to
commit
a
particular
sexual
act.
we
are
saying
that
there
is
a
fundamental
right
to
restrict
government's
intimate
regulation
of
the
privacies
of
association
like
in
the
home.
the
principle
that
we
champion
is
a
principle
of
limited
government,
it
is
not
a
principle
of
a
special
catalogue
of
rights.
robert
frost
once
said
that
home
is
the
place,
where
when
you
go
there
they
have
to
take
you
in.
i
think
constitutionally
home
is
the
place
where
when
the
government
would
tell
you
in
intimate
detail
what
you
must
do
there
and
how
to
behave
there,
they
have
to
give
you
a
better
reason
why
than
simply
an
invocation
of
the
majority's
morality
which
tautologically
would
vindicate
without
any
scrutiny
by
this
court
literally
every
intimate
regulation
of
everything
one
can
do
in
the
home.
it
doesn't
denigrate
the
special
place
of
family
and
parenthood
and
marriage
in
our
society
to
recognize
the
principle
of
limited
government.
on
the
contrary,
if
there
is
something
special
and
unique
about
parental
authority
it
is
that
we
do
not
cede
to
big
brother
the
same
unquestioned
deference
that
children
are
perhaps
supposed
to
give
to
their
parents.
when
the
government
would
tell
people
in
this
much
detail
how
to
conduct
their
intimate
lives
and
doesn't
apparently
have
a
good
enough
reason
to
keep
mr.
hardwich
in
something
other
than
a
limbo
in
which
he
could
be
prosecuted
any
time
until
august
under
this
extraordinarily
sweeping
law,
when
it
does
that,
it
seems
to
us
that
it
is
fully
respectful
of
history
and
tradition
for
the
eleventh
circuit
to
have
said
you
owe
mr.
hardwick
a
better
reason
and
you
owe
the
people
of
the
united
states
a
better
reason
than
simply
unquestioned
deference.
and,
i
think
justice
harlan,
if
the
issue
had
been
properly
posed
in
poe
v.
ullman
which,
of
course,
didn't
involve
this,
would
have
recognized
that
requirement
of
meaningful
justification.
even
if
you
only
call
it
rationality
review,
it
is
rationality
review
with
meaningful
content
of
the
kind
this
court
recognized
in
the
cleburne
case.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
oh,
it
certainly
hurts
more
than
it
helps.
i
was
suggesting,
however,
that
even
that
opinion...
that
even
in
that
opinion
there
is
room
for
some
hope.
your
opinion
in
moore
v.
east
cleveland
is
considerably
more
helpful,
because
in
that
opinion
you
talk
about
the
meaning
of
private
property
which
is
also
involved
in
this
case.
what
does
it
mean
to
say
one's
home
is
a
private
place
if
every
detail
of
what
one
does
there
can
be
regulated
by
the
state
because
they
think
it
is
an
irresponsible
liaison.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
very
meaning
of
home
is
denigrated
if
that
can
be
done.
it
seems
to
us
it
is
only
a
principle
of
limited
government
that
makes
it
important
to
affirm
the
eleventh
circuit's
decision
that
heightened
scrutiny
is
required
in
such
a
case.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that
is
right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
my
understanding
is
that
georgia
refuses
to
tell
us
other
than
to
say
that
the
acts
involved
we
say
are
immoral.
three
times
they
say
they
are
the
definition
of
evil,
although
half
the
states
have
decriminalized
them.
they
refuse
to
advance
a
purpose
or
utility.
it
is
in
that
respect
that
even
the
form
of
review
endorsed
by
justice
white's
dissent
in
moore
which
requires
some
meaningful
explanation
of
how
this
law
would
function
to
advance
the
public
welfare,
why
it
wouldn't
be
counter-productive,
why
it
wouldn't
cause
more
contempt
for
law
than
respect
for
families.
some
explanation
is
required.
and,
if
one
reverses
the
eleventh
circuit's
decision
and
allows
the
flat
and
unexplained
dismissal
of
the
district
court
to
stand,
the
message
of
that
is
the
state
need
not
offer
any
explanation,
no
utility,
no
function.
it
is
enough
to
say
we
passed
it,
that
means
most
of
us
thinks
it
is
wrong
and
a
lot
of
people
have
thought
it
was
wrong
for
a
long
time,
therefore,
ask
us
no
further
questions.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
yes.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
as
to
the
first,
if
the
state
of
georgia
were
simply
defending...
might
i
finish
the
answer
to
this
question,
mr.
chief
justice?
if
the
state
of
georgia
were
defending
its
refusal
to
sanction
homosexual
marriage,
there
would
be
a
close
connection
between
that
and
the
first
rationale.
the
connection,
however,
would
be
so
weak
between
this
sweeping
law
and
the
rationale
of
endorsing
or
helping
marriage
that
i
doubt
that
would
work.
as
to
avoiding
the
spread
of
communicable
diseases,
the
american
public
health
association,
at
page
27
of
the
amicus
brief,
they
think
that
this
law
and
laws
like
it
would
be
counter-productive
to
that
end,
but
you
don't
even
reach
that
issue
until
you
have
some
kind
of
meaningful
inquiry.
surely,
if
a
narrowly
tailored
law
could
be
shown
necessary
to
protect
the
public
health,
that
would
be
a
compelling
justification,
but
georgia
offers
no
such
justification
here.
limited
government,
we
think,
makes
the
eleventh
circuit's
decision
correct.
thank
you.
