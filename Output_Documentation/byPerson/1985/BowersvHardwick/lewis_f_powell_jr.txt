is
the

in
georgia?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
how
many
prosecutions
have
there
been
in
the
last
year
or
five
years?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
i
should
have
framed
my
question
more
specifically.
in
the
context
of
the
issue
presented
in
this
case
where
the
activity
took
place
in
a
private
residence,
has
it
ever
been
enforced?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
professor
tribe,
is
there
a
limiting
principle
to
your
argument?
you
commented,
but
i
don't
think
responded,
to
the
suggestion
that
how
do
you
draw
the
line
between
bigamy
involving
private
homes
or
incest
or
prostitution
and
you
move
on
to
the
place.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
emphasize
the
home
and
so
would
i
if
i
were
arguing
this
case,
but
what
about...
take
an
easier
one,
a
motel
room
or
the
back
of
an
automobile
or
toilet
or
wherever.
what
are
the
limiting
principles?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
to
the
place?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
about
incest
in
the
private
home?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so,
the
limiting
principle
is
limited
to
sodomy.
is
that
a
principle?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
professor
tribe,
let's
come
back
to
the
privacy
of
the
home
and
part
of
the
question
that
i
asked
you
and
i
don't
think
i
gave
you
an
opportunity
to
answer,
would
you
distinguish
the
home
between
the
back
of
an
automobile?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and,
a
public
toilet,
of
course?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
about
a
hotel
room
overnight?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
mentioned
something
special
about
a
home
in
moore
also
against
east
cleveland.
you
mentioned
poe
against
ullman,
but
doesn't
justice
harlan
in
his
dissenting
opinion
exclude
sodomy
when
he
was
talking
about
the
history
of
relationships?
