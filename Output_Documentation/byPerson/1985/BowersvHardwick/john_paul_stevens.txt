justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
ask,
what
is
your
position
on
the
application
of
the
statute
to
a
married
couple?
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
it
be
constitutionally
applied
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
they
could
or
could
not?
do
you
think
it
would
be
constitutional
or
unconstitutional
to
apply
it
to
a
married
couple?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
it
would
be
constitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and,
what
is
the
right
that
would
be
protected
of
the
married
person
in
that
situation
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and,
this
conduct,
though
it
is
traditionally
frowned
upon
as
i
understand
your
brief,
you
would
nevertheless
be
constitutionally
protected
in
the
marital
setting?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
didn't
say
anything
about
this
kind
of
conduct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
hobbs,
can
i
ask
you
one
question
that
is
prompted
by
justice
rehnquist's
notion
that
there
are
difficulties
of
enforcement
within
the
home
and
earlier
you
had
been
asked
about
the
extent
to
which
the
statute
has
been
enforced.
in
this
case,
as
i
read
the
complaint,
the
plaintiff
expressly
alleged
that
he
did
this
sort
of
thing
over
and
over
again.
and,
i
take
it
the
state
didn't
take
discovery
to
find
out
maybe
they
could
prove
that
that
was,
in
fact,
true
and,
therefore,
could
have
prosecuted
him.
how
do
you
reconcile
that
with
the
notion
that
there
is
a
statute
that
the
state
seeks
to
enforce
in
a
situation
which
he
says
exists
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
what
about
the
state
representative
to
defended
this
very
lawsuit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
they
thought
there
was
an
important
public
interest
in
enforcing
the
statute,
why
wouldn't
they
take
his
discovery,
get
him
to
admit
he
committed
all
these
acts
and
then
prosecute
him?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
can
understand
why
that
would
win
the
lawsuit
for
you,
but
i
find
it
puzzling
as
to
how
that
vindicates
the
public
interest
that
this
statute
was
supposed
to
serve
to
stop
this
kind
of
conduct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
state
really
have
an
interest
in
stopping
this
kind
of
conduct?
if
not,
why
wouldn't
they
enforce
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
have
been
very
easy
in
this
case,
in
this
instance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
presented
with
a
silver
platter
and
they
declined
to
go
forward.
it
seems
to
me
there
is
some
tension
between
the
obvious
ability
to
convict
this
gentleman
and
the
supposed
interest
in
general
enforcement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
tribe,
can
i
ask
you
a
little
more
about
your
second
limiting
principle.
your
first
is
the
place.
the
second,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
if
the
justification
is
to
protect
some
state-sanctioned
relationship
it
may
be
permissible.
would
it
be
permissible
under
your
view
for
the
state
to
prohibit
conduct
between...
heterosexual
conduct
between
males
and
females
who
are
not
married
to
one
another
and
not
married
to
anybody
else
in
order
to
discourage
that
kind
of
conduct
and
sort
of
foster
the
marriage
institution?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
you
are
saying
is
that
it
would
implicate
your
second
limiting
principle,
but
not
carry
the
day.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
you
say
there
is
a
parallel
between
that
problem
and
the
one
we
have
before
us
today.
justice
john
paul
stevens
one
could
argue
that
the
reason
for
discouraging
it
is
to
encourage
marriage.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
tribe,
i
am
curious
to
know,
you
have
referred
to
justice
white's
opinion
in
moore
v.
cleveland.
do
you
think
that
opinion
helps
you
or
hurts
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
one
other
question
which
is
really
about
justice
white's
opinion
which
seems
to
assume
that
a
law
that
has
some
impact
on
liberty
must
have
some
utility
or...
his
exact
line
which
is
must
have
a
purpose
or
utility.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
your
understanding
of
the
purpose
or
utility
of
the
law
of
the
state
in
this
case?
