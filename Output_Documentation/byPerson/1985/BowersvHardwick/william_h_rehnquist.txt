justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
this
isn't
a
review
of
any
conviction,
is
it?
the
only
reason
you
would
want
to
show
that
is
to
show
there
was
a
danger
of
prosecution.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
might
well,
as
a
practical
matter,
i
suppose,
prevent
the
state
from
enforcing
its
law
with
respect
to...
your
point
is
that
doesn't
make
the
law
invalid.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
hobbs,
when
you
say
"cohabitation
with
one's
relatives",
you
mean
living
in
the
same
house
with
them?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
tribe,
your
line
of
reasoning
would
make
the
edmonds
act
unconstitutional,
would
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
edmonds
act
forbade
the...
the
moral
act
forbade
polygamy
and
the
edmonds
act
forbade
cohabitation
by
one
who
is
already
married.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
tribe,
if
this
evolution
is
taking
place,
as
you
suggest,
and
you
may
well
be
right,
why
isn't
it
more
proper
for
this
court
to
let
it
be
reflected
in
the
majority
rule
where,
you
know,
states
have
repealed
these
statutes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
i
thought
your
argument
suggested
that
25
years
ago,
if
that
is
the
right
time
that
justice
harlan
wrote
his
dissent
in
poe
against
ullman,
perhaps
these
rights
wouldn't
have...
the
right
that
you
are
arguing
for
here,
the
right
to
commit
sodomy,
would
not
have
been
constitutionally
protected,
but
now
they
are.
what
has
happened
in
25
years?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
he
just
wrote
that
part
of
his
dissent
in
a
fit
of
absent-mindedness?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
it
is
a
facial
attack,
mr.
tribe.
i
had
thought
it
was
only
as
applied
in
the
home.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
you
are
saying
when
applied
in
the
home.
i
thought
your
response
to
justice
powell
was
that
a
hotel
room,
back
seat
of
a
car,
no.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
it
is
really
not
a
facial
attack
on
the
statute
i
don't
think.
