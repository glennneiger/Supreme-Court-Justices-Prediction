powell,

well,
did
the
prosecutor
in
this
case
try
to
get
an
injunction?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
this
question?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
am
i
mistaken?
i
was
under
the
impression
that
under
the
statute,
if
the
nuisance
was
found
to
exist,
the
court
had
no
alternative.
it
must
order
closure.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
interrupt
to
ask
this
question?
in
any
of
the
cases
you
have
cited,
was
conduct
alone
involved,
conduct
unrelated
to
speech?
you
rely
on
o'brien,
but
i
don't
recall
any
decision
of
this
court
that
ever
applied
o'brien
where
only
conduct
unrelated
to
speech
was
involved.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
was
conduct,
wasn't
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
conduct
in
lafayette
park.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
this
question?
the
statute
on
its
face
is
completely
neutral,
isn't
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--yes.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
never
where
there
is
conduct
unrelated
to
speech.
at
least
i
can't
recall
a
case.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
where
the
only
issue
was
conducted
unrelated
to
speech.
