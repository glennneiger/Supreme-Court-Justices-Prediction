mr.
john
j.
de
franks
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
present
case
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
stems
from
an
action
under
new
york's
public
health
law
to
abate
a
nuisance
allegedly
occurring
at
respondent's
book
store
premises.
in
the
trial
court,
respondents
moved
for
summary
judgment,
arguing
that
the
closure
provision
of
the
public
health
laws
constituted
an
impermissible
prior
restraint.
the
motion
was
denied.
the
denial
was
affirmed
by
the
intermediate
appellate
court.
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
however,
found
the
law,
the
closure
provision,
that
is,
to
constitute
an
unlawful
prior
restraint
upon
respondents'
first
amendment
right.
the
issue
as
we
see
it
before
this
court
is
twofold:
firstly,
whether
the
closure
provision
amounts
to
any
regulation
of
speech:
and
secondly,
if
it
does,
is
it
not
a
valid
time,
place,
or
manner
restriction?
we
argue
initially
that
closure
does
not
restrict
speech
in
any
form,
oral
or
written,
pure
or
symbolic.
closure
would
be
the
result
of
criminal
conduct
which
my
opponent
concedes
has
no
expressive
element.
neither
the
complaint
nor
the
law
generically
is
concerned
with
control
of
any
content,
and
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
so
found.
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights
could
never
bring
this
law
to
bear
against
the
respondents,
and
that
is
exactly
what
distinguishes
this
case
from
every
other
case
cited
by
both
sides
in
this
controversy.
in
all
of
those
other
cases,
it
was
the
exercise
or
intended
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights
that
put
the
individual
on
a
collision
course
with
the
law.
in
this
case,
no
matter
what
he
says,
no
matter
what
he
sells,
legal
or
illegal,
it
could
never
result
in
a
proceeding
for
closure.
mr.
john
j.
de
franks
no,
it
would
not.
the
new
york
courts
have
interpreted
this
law
to
require
proof
of
a
continuing
course
of
conduct.
both
courts,
the
appellate
division
and
the
court
of
appeals,
have
agreed
in
that.
mr.
john
j.
de
franks
no,
under
the
law
the
closure
is
mandatory
at
the
conclusion
of
a
successful
prosecution.
the
present
case
is
really
like
that.
mr.
john
j.
de
franks
the
prosecutor
in
this
case
commenced
the
action,
and
the
case
was
dismissed
prior
to
the
trial,
but
in
our
complaint
we
sought
injunction
and
closure,
hot
the
two
come
together
as
part
of
the
law.
mr.
john
j.
de
franks
yes,
that's
correct.
correct.
mr.
john
j.
de
franks
correct.
mr.
john
j.
de
franks
correct.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
present
case
is
like
that
of
a
publisher,
say,
who
is
incarcerated
for
conduct
unrelated
to
his
publishing
activity.
surely
his
incarceration
incidentally
affects
his
freedom
to
publish,
but
would
anyone
suggest
that
he
be
entitled
to
an
o'brien
analysis
on
the
date
of
sentencing?
i
would
think
not,
because
the
penalty
is
unrelated
to
his
first
amendment
activity.
there
is
no
causal
connection.
mr.
john
j.
de
franks
could
we
close
down
the
premises?
mr.
john
j.
de
franks
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
de
franks
yes,
your
honor.
this
law
would
apply
whether
it
be
a
newspaper
or
a
church
or
a
car
dealership.
mr.
john
j.
de
franks
yes,
the
law
does
not
indicate
that
there
has
to
be
knowledge
by
the
owner,
but
only
that
the
premises
is
being
used
for
the
conduct.
it
requires
the
owner...
it
puts
a
burden
on
the
owner
to
know
what
is
going
on
at
his
premises.
mr.
john
j.
de
franks
well,
in
this
case--
mr.
john
j.
de
franks
--in
this
case
it
was
a
premises
open
to
the
public,
so
in
this
case
it
was
open
and
notorious,
because
the
undercover
officer
was
able
to
observe
it
from
the
position
he
was
in
which
was
in
the
area
of
the
movie
projectors,
the
booths.
as
i
was
suggesting
earlier,
there
is
no
causal
connection,
and
in
this
case
the
exercise
of
their
right
to
disseminate
sexually
explicit
materials
could
never
bring
the
law,
the
closure
provision
down,
against
them,
and
this
closure
provision
does
not
prohibit
relocation.
in
and
of
itself,
it
is
not
concerned
with
where
the
respondents
move
to
to
continue
in
their
operation.
respondents
deny
this.
they
say
we
are
left
with
no
option.
we
must
remain
there.
they
cite
an
ordinance
that
they
never
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals
below,
the
kenmore
adult
use
ordinance.
however,
that
ordinance
on
its
face
indicates
that
he
may
move
to
an
alternative
location,
and
as
the
maps
we
have
provided
indicate,
the
alternative
locations
are
ample
and
reasonable
in
light
of
the
fact
that
the
village
of
kenmore
is
a
ten-by-eighteen-block
village,
wholly
consumed
within
the
town
of
tonawanda,
which
is
15
times
its
size,
and
which
also
allows
alternative
sites
for
adult
uses.
that
the
sites
wight
cost
respondents
sore
than
they
are
willing
to
spend
is
of
no
moment.
as
this
court
stated
in
renton,
economic
impact,
which
is
the
only
real
impact
here,
economic
impact
is
simply
irrelevant
to
a
first
amendment
inquiry,
but
if
we
would
have
assumed
that
economic
impact
somehow
translates
into
a
restriction
on
speech,
we
would
argue
that
this
is
a
legitimate
time,
place,
or
manner
restriction,
a
legimitate
place
restriction.
the
law
is
content
neutral.
it
is
unconcerned
with
content.
it
is
interesting
that
when
the
law
went
to
the
court
of
appeals,
it
was
neutral
in
all
respects.
when
it
returned
from
the
court
of
appeals,
the
bookstore
had
been
accorded
a
privilege
that
we
assume
might
not
he
accorded
to
a
car
dealership
or
a
pharmacy.
mr.
john
j.
de
franks
yes.
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
de
franks
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
mr.
john
j.
de
franks
correct.
mr.
john
j.
de
franks
right,
in
this
particular
case,
and
it
was
very
clear
that
the
managers
and
higher
ranking
officials
with
the
company
were
well
aware
of
what
was
going
on.
they
allowed
it
because
they
indicated
that
it
gave
them
the
opportunity
to
make
money
off
the
machines--
mr.
john
j.
de
franks
--those
are
the
allegations
in
the
complaint.
as
i
mentioned,
the
closure
provision
does
not
block
alternative
channels.
the
government's
interest
is
strong
here,
and
the
court
of
appeals
so
found.
the
government
sought
to
control
criminal
activity
and
the
spread
of
transmissible
sexual
diseases.
the
law
is
found
under
the
public
health
law.
the
closure
provision
is
narrowly
tailored.
it
controls
the
premises
in
this
case.
however,
it
does
not
bring
under
its
ambit
the
prostitution-free
premises
of
others,
nor
does
it
infringe
upon
the
constitutional
eights
of
the
respondents
nor
any
other
individual.
in
reality--
mr.
john
j.
de
franks
--exactly.
under
our
first
analysis,
we
would
contend
this
is
not
a
first
amendment
case
at
all,
and
this
would
only
be
our
secondary
position.
in
fact,
the
closure
here
would
have
no
more
effect
on
respondents
than
the
termination
of
their
lease,
the
taking
of
the
property
though
eminent
domain,
or
a
tax
foreclosure.
the
place
restriction
has
a
rational
basis.
it
works
to
controvert
the
price
use
pattern
of
the
premises
and
rehabilitate
the
situs.
it
doesn't
take
the
property
for
all
time,
and
it
allows
for
a
discretionary
release
of
the
property
for
good
cause.
now,
if
that
release
is
denied
in
new
york,
that
denial
would
be
reviewed
by
an
appellate
court,
if
the
respondents
so
desired.
as
this
court
has
stated
in
albertini,
if
a
time,
place,
and
banner
restriction
meets
the
prerequisites
i
spoke
of,
it
will
be
determined
to
be
legitimate
if
the
government's
interest
is
accomplished
in
a
better
manner
with
it
than
without
it.
i
think
in
this
case
it
is
clear
that
the
government's
interest
would
be
served
better
with
closure
than
without
it,
because
closure
prevents
the
recurrence
of
the
conduct,
whereas
injunction
would
admit
the
possibility
of
recurrence
and
punish
after
the
fact.
my
opponent's
suggestion
that
there
exists
a
state
constitutional
basis
for
this
decision
is
simply
not
proven
by
the
opinion.
the
court
of
appeals
decided
this
case
on
the
basis
of
your
decision
in
o'brien.
they
did
not
cite
the
new
york
state
constitution
at
all
as
authority.
they
mentioned
it
once
in
reference,
but
that
related
to
a
restatement
of
respondent's
arguments
in
the
court
of
first
instance.
this
is
contracts
that
by
the
19
references
to
the
first
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution
and
footnote
3
where
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
stated,
we
are
adjudicating
the
first
amendment
question,
and
as
this
court
is
aware,
there
is
no
first
amendment
in
the
state
of
new
york,
speech
is
accorded
protection
under
article
i,
section
8.
in
conclusion,
i
point
out
to
this
court
that
the
law
does
not
seek
to
control
or
censor
the
content
of
any
of
the
materials
the
respondents
are
disseminating.
it
does
not
deny
him
access.
there
are
alternative
channels.
it
is
simply
not
a
prior
restraint.
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong,
and
we
urge
that
their
judgment
be
reversed.
mr.
john
j.
de
franks
just
one
thing,
your
honor.
i
just
would
like
to
refer
the
court
to
cur
appendix
in
our
reply
brief
where
the
lmaps
demonstrate
that
there
absolutely
is
an
area
set
aside
in
both
the
village
and
the
town
for
adult
uses.
thank
you.
mr.
john
j.
de
franks
on
a
first
analysis,
correct.
mr.
john
j.
de
franks
right.
it
is
only
on
our
secondary
analysis,
time,
place,
and
manner.
i
agree
that
our
first
position,
our
initial
position
is
a
much
stronger
position.
