mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
initially
i
think
that
it
is
important
to
again
emphasize
the
record
that
we
come
up
here
on.
we
have
a
complaint
only,
and
for
purposes
of
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
of
course,
the
allegations
are
admitted
to
be
true.
that
is
the
law
in
new
york
state
and
most
other
jurisdictions.
we
do
not
have
in
that
complaint,
however,
an
allegation
by
the
people
that
closure
of
the
store
is
necessary
to
abate
the
nuisance.
they
allege
in
the
complaint
that
the
activities
themselves
of
which
they
complain,
the
prostitution
activities,
et
cetera,
should
be
restrained.
they
do,
of
course,
ask
in
their
wherefore
clause
that
the
closure
provisions
and
so
on
he
applied,
hut
they
never
allege
that
closure
is
necessary
in
order
to
abate
this
nuisance.
in
addition
to
that,
they
do
not
allege
and
there
is
no
proof
on
this
record
that
there
are
indeed
ample
other
locations
available.
in
each
case
by
this
court
where
ample
locations
has
come
up
as
an
issue,
most
recently
renton,
through
justice
rehnquist--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
that
is
the
way
the
statute
is
written.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
and
the
way
it
has
teen
applied
by
the
court
of
appeals
is
to
make
this
a
permissive
rather
than
a
mandatory
closure,
and
the
reason
that
that
was
done
was
to
say
that
based
on
this
record,
this
would
not
be
justified.
it
would
not
be
the
least
drastic
means
or
the
narrowest
means,
and
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
arrived
at
that,
and
i
think
that
it
makes
sense,
because
historically
if
you
look
at
nuisance
cases,
we
always
see
a
broad
area
of
discretion
given
to
the
trial
court
to
fashion
a
remedy,
whether
it
be
first
amendment
or
just
a
factory,
to
fashion
a
remedy
that
supposedly
fits
the
nuisance
as
it
is
found
and
as
it
is
defined
by
the
record.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
that
is
what
the
statute
says
literally,
and
the
way
that
the
court
of
appeals
interpreted
that
to
be
permissive
versus
mandatory
was
to
analyze
the
record,
analyze
the
law
from
this
court
and
from
the
state
court
and
make
the
determination
that--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--i
think
that
is
partly
right.
there's
two
things
the
court
did.
the
first
thing
the
court
did
was
say
that
it
wasn't
necessary
in
order
to
effectuate,
if
you
will,
the
legislation
here,
to
close
the
store
based
on
this
record,
and
i
think
that
what
happens
by
that
statement
is
that
the
court
interprets,
first
of
all,
what
the
intent
of
its
legislation
is,
which
i
submit
is
legitimate
for
the
highest
court
of
the
state
to
do,
and
i
might
add,
this
is
the
first
time
this
has
ever
arisen
in
the
state
of
new
york
with
regard
to
application
of
this
statute.
this
statute
by
all
history
is
a
house
of
prostitution
statute.
now
it
is
being
applied
in
this
case
for
the
first
time
in
an
area
where
there
is
undeniably
and
admittedly
on
the
part
of
the
prosecution
lawful
speech
conduct
occurring
on
the
premises,
so
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
was
say
first
of
all
in
viewing
our
piece
of
legislation
we
say
that
it
is
not
necessary
in
order
to
carry
out
the
force
of
the
legislation
on
this
record,
and
they
emphasize
under
these
circumstances,
on
this
record
it
is
not
necessary
to
have
closure,
that
to
do
so
would,
because
of
the
first
amendment
implications
here,
constitute
a
restraint,
and
i--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--no,
and
i
think
there
is
an
obvious
distinction
there,
and
that
is
this.
if
i
failed
to
pay
taxes,
and
i
had
a
publishing
concern,
a
newspaper,
if
i
failed
to
pay
taxes,
or
if
i
had
some
zoning
problem,
the
narrowest
remedy
available
would
be
for
me
to
pay
the
taxes
or
to
correct
the
zoning
problem.
that
is
the
narrowest
remedy,
and
the
moment
that
i
do
that,
there
is
no
cessation
beyond
my
satisfying
that
narrowest
remedy
to
my
publishing,
but
in
this
case--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--i
think
the
point
there
is
what
the
city
would
say
is
that
the
least
you
can
do
to
comply
with
our
noncontent
legislation
here
is
to
correct
x,
y,
and
z
fire
code.
that
is
what
you
have
to
do.
that
is
the
least
drastic
remedy.
there
is
no
other.
and
so
therefore
once
you
do
that
you
are
able
to
open.
in
this
case
the
court
of
appeals,
and
i
believe
rightfully
so,
and
i
think
it
is
reasonable,
said,
the
least
drastic
remedy
on
this
record
is
to
at
least
in
the
first
instance
have
an
injunction
or
attempted
injunction.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
and
i
think
for
good
reason,
and
i
might
say
this
is
the
reason.
if
we
look
at
the
history
of
the
decisions
of
this
court,
whether
it
be
healy
v.
james
or
procunier
or
schaumberg
or
schad
or
american
mini,
and
a
lot
of
other
cases
that
have
come
down
from
this
court,
the
court
has
said
that
even
in
a
situation
where
motivation
is
not
considered,
or
where
content
is
not
considered,
the
court
must
consider
the
effect
of
legislation
on
expressive
conduct
on
expressive
conduct
by
an
individual,
the
effect
of
the
legislation.
otherwise,
i
submit,
justice
o'connor,
we
would
be
in
a
situation
where
if
a
community
could
simply
pass
a
law
and
it
could
tremendously
affect
a
newspaper,
motion
picture
studio,
what
have
you,
but
if
they
simply
said,
it
is
content
neutral,
completely,
they
would
have
total
immunity
from
any
scrutiny
by
this
court
or
any
other
court
on
the
position
that
we
are
not
saying
anything
at
all
about
your
theater
or
about
your
newspaper,
whatever.
we
have
a
fire
code,
for
example.
i
think
that
since
it
would
affect,
and
any
time
it
does
affect,
and
i
believe
this
court's
decisions
say
that,
that
when
legislation
affects
speech,
it
is
subject
to
some
kind
of
scrutiny
by
the
court,
whether
it
be
o'brien
or
whether
it
be
the
time,
place,
and
manner,
and
i
might
say
that
in
some
cases
it
looks
as
if,
for
example,
in
the
creative
nonviolence
situation,
we
start
off
with
an
o'brien
observation,
and
it
goes
into
a
time,
place,
and
manner,
and
sometimes
these
seem
to
overlap
one
another.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
i
think
that
if
we
had
a
situation
where--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--i
am
attempting
to
answer
your
question.
i
think
that
if
we
take
any
piece
of
legislation
that
can
affect
speech
directly...
now,
example
here.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
it
could
affect
speech
directly,
yes.
i
think
it
could.
for
example,
if
we
had
an
american
mini
type
statute
that
said--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
yes,
i
think
fire
would
be
analogous
to
zoning,
and
we
could
make
the
same
argument.
there
would
be
some
scrutiny
if
we
started
to
affect
that
particular
area
of
speech,
if
we
had
to--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--i
think
it
would
depend
on
what
the
ordinance
said.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
that
would
be
true.
i
think
that
if
it
said,
however,
that
even
if
you
corrected
the
fire,
the
brick,
the
smoke
detectors,
you
would
be
closed
for
a
period
of
time,
no
matter
what.
then
i
think
that
would
affect
first
amendment
rights,
and
that
is
the
facts
we
have
here.
we
are
not
dealing
simply
with
something
like
fire,
where
we
are
saying,
once
you
cure
the
problem,
you
can
open.
we
are
dealing
with
something
that
goes
beyond
what
is
necessary
to
cure
the
problem,
so
in
your
fire
analogy,
if
we
had
one
that
said
nevertheless,
even
after
you
correct
the
fire
problem,
you
still
have
to
be
closed
for
a
period
of
one
year,
i
submit
that
that
kind
of
legislation
then
would
be
subjected
to
scrutiny
by
the
court,
and
we
would
say,
is
that
a
legitimate
time,
place,
or
manner,
or
is
that
a
legitimate,
whatever
the--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--i
don't
know
basically
what
the
purpose
would
be
unless
we
had
the
facts
before
us
to
see.
in
other
words--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
that's
exactly
what
the
legislation
said.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
but
isn't--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--but,
justice
white,
isn't
the
point
here
in
this
case--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--i
think
depending
upon
the
record,
i
would
agree.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
depending
upon
the
facts
in
the
record,
yes.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
oh,
no,
i
never--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--not
at
any
time,
because,
you
see--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--no.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
you
could
definitely
close
the
house
of
prostitution
or
the
prostitution...
and
the
court
of
appeals
has
said
the
same
thing.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
what
i
am
saying--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--what
i
am
saying
is,
again,
depending
upon
the
facts,
the
remedy
has
to
fit
the
problem.
if
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
which
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
been
dealing
with,
they
felt
that
the
lesser
means
or
the
narrowest
means
was
to
first
attempt
the
injunction.
they
never
said
abatement
wasn't
a
proper
remedy,
that
it
could
never
be
a
proper
remedy.
if
they
would
have
said
that,
then
i
think
the
district
attorney
would
be
here
with
that
sort
of
issue
before
this
court.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
i
think
that
it
clearly
is
too
excessive
under
the
first
amendment,
because
what
it
amounts
to
is,
it
is
an
overkill.
one
time
this
court--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--nothing.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
as
far
as
penalty,
your
honor,
it
simply--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--indicates
that
it
can't
be
abridged,
that
it
can't
be
suppressed,
and
that
is
what
this
is.
this
is
a
situation
where...
this
is
a
situation
where
there
is
a
total
closure
here
of
a
lawful,
legitimate
aspect
of
a
business
before
the
reasonable
step
under
this
record
is
being
taken,
which
is
to
attempt
an
injunction
or
to
have
an
injunction,
and
i
submit
that
all
the
court
of
appeals
said
was
this.
it
never
said
that
closure
wasn't
a
valid
remedy.
it
said
that
on
this
record
it
was
overly
broad.
this
court
has
said
on
a
number
of
occasions
and
talked
about
overly
broad
remedies
in
first
amendment
areas,
in
areas
where
you
found
that
narrower
means
could
be
used
in
order
to
vindicate
the
purpose
of
a
piece
of
legislation,
and
i
submit
that
it
is
only
reasonable
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
say
in
this
case,
why
is
it
unfair,
why
is
it
unreasonable
when
we
have
a
legitimate
aspect
of
a
business,
not
simply
sex
books,
but
all
kinds
of
books
and
magazines,
why
is
it
unfair
to
say
to
the
court
below
that
the
narrowest
means,
which
are
already
in
the
statute,
they
don't
have
to
be
made
up
by
anybody,
they
are
in
the
statute,
that
the
narrowest
means
here
is
an
injunction.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
yes,
there
is
in
the
statute
a
provision.
however,
the
problem
with
the
statute
is
that
when
it
was
amended,
and
it
was
amended
over
the
years,
an
additional
provision
was
added
sating
that
there
shall
be
an
abatement.
now,
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
done
here
is
basically
what
the
state
of
california
has
done
through
its
supreme
court,
and
it
is
to
make
it
a
permissive
closure
versus
a
mandatory
one,
and
they
simply
took
the
position
that
where
we
have
this
effect,
you
should
follow
the
narrowest
means,
and
not
the
most
drastic
means,
but
the
narrowest
means.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
i
think
that
that...
and
the
way
they
interpreted
their
legislation
that
it
did
not
require
closure
regardless
of
the
facts.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
yes,
and
i
think
the
key
phrase
begins
off
with
"under
these
circumstances".
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
under
these
circumstances,
because
it
wasn't
the
narrowest
means
available.
if
we
look
at
all
the
other
cases
coming
out
of
this
court,
for
example,
the
recent
one,
creative
nonviolence,
albertini,
and
the
other
cases,
if
we
look
at
those
cases,
we
find
that
there
are
and
there
is
on
the
record,
a
finding
on
the
record
of
ample
other
outlets
for
the
distribution
of
the
material
or
the
speech
that
is
involved.
creative
nonviolence
on
the
mall,
all
types
of
things
were
able
to
he
done
there
to
make
the
speech.
with
regard
to
this
case,
however,
we
do
not
have
that.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
demonstrate
that.
in
fact,
because
the
district
attorney
had
made
a
statement
in
the
brief,
they
could
simply
move
across
the
street,
that
is
what
compelled
us
to
have
to
file
an
appendix
in
this
case
showing
that
they
were
there
under
a
prior
nonconforming
use
in
this
particular
area,
and
it
is
extremely
restrictive,
but
i
think
the
point
is
that
if
we
look
at
renton,
and
we
look
at
schad,
and
we
look
at
american
mini
theaters,
in
each
case
there
was
a
specific
finding
there
relied
upon
by
this
court
to
say
that
there
were
ample
other
outlets.
the
court
said,
we
find
that.
in
renton
they
found
the
district
court
had
ruled
that
way.
in
american
mini,
in
footnote
35,
the
court
there
said
that
we
find
myriad
other
locations,
and
so
on,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
when
we
look
at
these
other
cases,
we
can
see
that
each
one
of
those
individuals
could
still
have
an
outlet
for
speech.
in
american
mini,
for
example,
they
could
have
shorn
other
types
of
movies,
or
in
schad,
they
could
have
had
other
kinds
of
books,
magazines,
or
what
have
you.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
if
i
might
say,
i
think
if
we
look
at
the
committee
for
creative
nonviolence
case,
there
the
question
was
whether
sleeping
was
prohibited.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
and
that
was
simply
conduct,
and
in
that
case
i
think
the
chief
justice
indicated
conduct
is
not
talking
or
not
speech.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
yes,
and
in
this
particular
case
we
have
pure
speech,
admittedly
pure
speech
being
detrimentally
affected
when
it
doesn't
have
to
be,
and
the
purpose
of
the
statute
can
still
be
furthered
simply
by
the
injunction,
and
if
it
is
not,
if
it
is
not,
then
the
cases
cited
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
their
decision,
croaton
and
allouwill
and
so
on,
in
those
cases,
the
record
there
demonstrated
there
should
be
a
closure.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
the
statute
on
its
face
doesn't--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--say
anything
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
and
there
are
a
number
of
statutes
that
have
been
neutral,
but
nevertheless
this
court
has
applied
the
balancing
test.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
never
where
conduct
unrelated
to
speech.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
if
we
had...
no,
i
agree.
i
think
that
what
we
have
is,
we
see
two
kinds
of
cases.
we
have
on
where
there
is
conduct,
mixed
conduct
and
speech,
which
would
be
like
o'brien,
for
example.
in
o'brien,
the
position
taken
by
the
individual
was
that
burning
the
draft
card
was
symbolic
speech,
the
court
disagreed
with
that,
and
found,
of
course,
that
it
could
be
regulated
under
this
test.
in
healy
v.
james,
we
had
a
status
thing,
where
they
would
recognize
or
not
the
sds
on
a
campus.
and
in
that
particular
case
they
certainly
argued
that
this
was
an
infringement
on
their
speech
not
to
be
recognized,
and
the
court
rock
the
position,
we
have
to
now
go
through
this
measuring
test,
and
in
a
whole
raft
of
cases
the
court
has
always
taken
the
position
that
where
speech
is
involved
and
affected,
and
the
words
used
by
the
court
repeatedly
have
been
affected,
that
then
this
measuring
test
takes
place--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--no,
and
if,
however,
there
was
a
law
that
said
that
if
you
are
convicted
of
speeding
or
arrested
for
speeding,
then
you
cannot
act
as
an
anchorperson
for
a
year
after
that
time,
then
i
would
submit
we
are
involved
in
an
overly
broad
regulation,
because
in
the
case
you
pose,
the
thing
that
needs
to
be
addressed
is
the
actual
conduct
that
is
against
the
law,
and
i
think
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
said
here.
the
conduct
against
the
law
is
the
activity
of
the
patrons
or
some
patrons
over
the
short
period
of
time
on
the
premises.
and
that
should
be
addressed.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
but,
your
honor,
if
i
might,
i
don't
see
how
that
is
analogous
to
this
situation,
where
the
problem
is,
it
is
the
closure
order
that
we
are
dealing
with
and
not
the
restraint.
the
restraint
everyone
agrees,
i
believe,
can
and
should
be
imposed
under
the
right
record.
it
is
the
closure,
the
total
closure
where
this
court
of
appeals
has
said
it
is
overly
broad.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
it
runs
against
the
premises,
and
the
people
punished
are
the
people
who
have
control
and
ownership
of
the
premises,
including
corporate
officers
and
so
on.
so
it
is
there.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
trial
court
in
this
case--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--i
submit,
your
honor,
that
there
has
been
no
proof
of
that
and
no
allegation
of
that
in
this
case.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
it
is
not
a
fact.
it
is
in
fact
the
contrary
fact.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
not
in
this
community,
they
are
not.
that
is
why
we
have
had
a
lodging
here
with
the
court,
because
there
was
a
statement
made
by
the
state
that
they
could
simply
move
across
the
street
or
next
door,
and
we
demonstrated
that
we
had
litigation
over
that.
they
are
in
this
location
as
a
prior
nonconforming
use.
there
is
a
little
strip
that
has
been
provided
for
in
part
of
the
city
which
they
say
is
the
area
where
adult
uses
can
go,
and
that
particular
strip
at
this
point
is
not
applicable
because
of
the
grandfather
rights.
there
was
litigation
in
this
case,
but
there
was
no...
there
is
not
even
an
allegation
in
the
complaint,
which
is
our
record
here,
that
other
avenues
are
available,
and
the
court
has
always
required
that
if
somebody
is
imposing
a
time,
place,
and
manner
restraint,
that
it
is
their
burden
to
demonstrate
that
all
the
requirements
are
there,
including
ample
other
avenues,
and
in
each
one
of
these
cases
where
the
court
has
upheld
effect
legislation
on
speech,
they
have
found
specifically
proof
of
other
ample
avenues,
and
we
just
don't
have
that
here.
i
submit
it
is
not
unfair
in
a
nuisance
case
and
unreasonable
for
the
court
to
simply
say,
it
is
like
if
you
have
a
rash
on
your
hand,
the
most
efficient
remedy
would
be
to
put
the
person
to
death.
that
is
certainly
the
most
efficient
remedy,
but
is
it
reasonable?
the
reasonable
thing
would
be
to
at
least
in
the
first
analysis...
and
i
submit,
expression
is
entitled
to
this.
this
is
a
clearly,
admittedly
lawful
expressive
area.
isn't
it
entitled
to
first
have
the
part
of
the
statute
that
provides
for
the
injunction
to
be
applied
first
before
the
door
is
slammed
shut?
it
is
not
like
being
attested
for...
there
was
a
statement
made
in
the
opening
remarks,
it
is
similar
to
being
arrested.
it
is
not
similar
to
being
arrested
for
a
crime
or
even
for
the
crime
of
obscenity
if
that
were
to
be
applied,
because
with
the
arrest
you
certainly
could
punish
that
individual.
if
that
person
owned
a
newspaper,
when
you
arrested
him
and
convicted
him
of
that
particular
crime,
you
wouldn't
simultaneously
go
to
their
newspaper
and
put
a
padlock
around
the
front
door,
and
that
is
exactly
what
happens
here,
and
that
is
the
difference,
and
that
is
why
arrest,
penal
law
provisions,
tax
abatement,
and
so
on,
are
not
the
same,
because
in
those
cases,
once
you
take
care
of
that
ill,
that
problem,
it
does
not
have
a
spillover
effect
on
the
first
amendment
expression
part,
and
that
is
the
problem
here.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
yes.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
i
think
if
they
allege
that,
if
we
had
another
lawsuit,
yes.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
yes.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
i
think
yes
and
no.
when
we
come
up
before
the
court
of
appeals,
they
are
dealing
with
a
record
that
shows
that
in
three
fears
between
the
fine
this
suit
is
filed
until
the
time
it
gets
to
them,
there
hasn't
been
one
arrest,
there
has
been
no
injunction
successfully
gotten
because
when
they
were
there
the
courts
found
there
were
adequate
legal
remedies
which
were
using
the
penal
law
provision
for
nuisance
and
so
on,
and
i
eight
say
that
in
reading
the
decisions
of
this
court,
village
of
schaumberg
and
some
others,
this
court
has
taken
the
position
that
in
evaluating
whether
the
narrowest
remedy
is
being
used
you
can
look
to
whether
there
are
more
direct
penal
remedies
involved,
which
one
of
the
trial
courts
did
in
this
case.
so
the
court
of
appeals
gets
this
case
with
nothing
having
occurred
in
three
years,
no
arrest
of
a
single
patron
at
any
time
for
any
conduct,
and
no
injunction
gotten
by
the
district
attorney,
no
trial
had,
and
there
has
been
no
stay
in
this
case.
up
until
the
time
we
had
the
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals,
nothing
preventing
them
from
having
a
trial
in
this
case.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
they...
no,
i
don't
believe
that
is
true
at
all.
the
final
relief
provides
for
the
abatement.
interim
relief
is
unrestricted,
and
interim
relief
here,
there
was
never
a
sufficient
showing,
and
they
made
two--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--yes,
and
what
the
trial
court
found
was
that
they
didn't
demonstrate
that
there
were
not
adequate
legal
remedies,
that
in
addition
they
didn't--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--no,
i
submit
no,
your
honor.
for
example--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--your
honor,
in
the
village
of
schaumberg
case,
which
you
wrote
the
decision
in--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--you
looked
to
the
fact
of
using
penal
laws
in
an
area
for
lesser
or
more
direct
means
than
using
equitable
remedies,
or
using
other
remedies
that
weren't
as
narrow,
and
i
submit
they
legitimately
did
that
here,
and
further,
i
submit
this,
that
if
they
demonstrated
below--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--because
they
didn't
have
a
sufficient
showing,
not
that
it
wouldn't
be
proper
with
a
sufficient
showing,
but
they
didn't
have
a
sufficient
legal
showing,
and
the
decision
is
here
from
the
lower
court
about
the
fact
of
the
hearsay
nature
of
it
and
the
fact
that
they
tried
never
to
have
an
arrest...
i
mean,
in
these
other
cases
we
look
at
croaton
and
allouwill
and
so
on.
they
had
arrests
in
those
cases.
they
attempted
to
have
a
direct
legal
remedy
be
imposed,
and
it
failed,
and
then
they
had
a
proper
record
to
show
they
could
get
a
closure,
and
i
submit
in
this
case
that
the
area
of
expression
is
important
enough
that
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
say
that
under
the
right
case,
under
the
right
circumstances
pled
and
proved,
they
can
get
a
closure
order,
but
under
this
case
the
record
does
act
substantiate
that.
we
have
no
attempt
whatsoever
to
try
legitimate,
viable
interim
remedies
here
in
a
substantial
or
sufficient
way,
and
if
they
had
all
of
the
pervasiveness
and
so
on,
i
have
to
assume
they
would
have
moved
under
those
grounds
and
said
that,
in
fact,
even
had
alleged
in
their
complaint
that
they
needed
closure
in
order
to
stop
the
activity
on
the
store,
which
they
never
even
allege
in
their
complaint.
so
i
submit--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--well,
but
i
don't
think
that's--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--i
don't
think
that's...
they
have
not
said
that,
because
they
would
have
to
allege
it
so
that
we
could
at
least
deny
it,
so
that
then
there
would
be
an
issue
of
fact
foe
someone
to--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--the
statute
simply
says--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--right,
the
statute
says
there
is
one
and
only
one
remedy
basically
no
matter
what
the
facts
are,
and
i
submit
that
is
the
problem
here.
one
and
only
one
remedy
without
regard
to
what
the
facts
are
is
the
problem
in
this
case,
and
it
is
not
unreasonable,
i
submit
again,
to
say
in
this
case
where
we
have
a
fetal
cessation
of
this
outlet
without
any
demonstration
of
other
adequate
outlets
available,
to
say
that
it
is
worth
it
and
it
is
worth
it
to
our
system
of
free
expression
to
say
attempt
the
injunction
or
get
the
injunction,
because
they
could
certainly,
from
what
they
allege
here,
take
the
position
they
could
get
a
permanent
injunction
at
the
end
of
a
trial.
if
it
doesn't
work
like
it
didn't
in
croaton
and
it
didn't
in...
it
did
in
the
other
case,
but
not
in
croaton,
then
they
would
be
entitled
to
closure,
and
i
think
that
is
why
this
statute
isn't
emasculated
at
all.
it
is
just
simply
a
reasonable
response,
saying
let's
just
tailor
it
like
we
do
any
other
nuisance.
if
we
had
a
factory
that
was
emitting
pollutants,
it
seems
to
me
if
we
had
a
law
that
said
any
pollutants
emitted
would
require
bulldozing
down
the
factory,
that
this
court
would
take
a
hard
look
at
that
and
say,
well,
wait
a
minute.
isn't
there
a
lesser
means,
a
filter
on
the
stack
system
or
what
have
you?
do
we
have
to
bulldoze
it
down?
and
i
submit,
that
is
what
is
happening
here.
we
have
an
all
or
nothing
blunderbust
kind
of
remedy,
a
machete
versus
the
scalpel
that
ought
to
be
used
in
the
first
amendment
area,
and
i
just
submit
that
that
response
below
is
a
reasonable
one,
and
it
is
one
that
deserves
to
be
employed,
and
it
may
be
that
when
they
have
the
trial
in
this
case
they
can
demonstrate
that
it
is
not
effective
to
simply
have
an
injunction,
that
there
must
be
a
closure,
and
if
that
is
so,
then
i
submit
that
would
be
proper.
if
not,
i
ask
the
decision
below
be
affirmed.
