mr.
defranks,
let
me
go
back
to
a
point
that
was
raised
a
couple
moments
ago.
this
case
has
not
yet
been
to
trial,
has
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
happened
was
that
the
appellate
courts
in
new
york
upheld
kind
of
a
demur
to
the
complaint
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
motion
for...
and
the
district
attorney's
allegations
in
this
case
were
that
the
defendant
was
aware
of
what
was
going
on
in
the
store?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
for
purposes
or
the
case
before
us,
we
assume
that
those
were
the
facts.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
those
are
the
allegations.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
your
opponent
here
says
that
the
new
york
statutory
scheme
does
not
give
trial
courts
that
sort
of
discretion
here,
that
upon
a
showing
of
this
kind,
closure
is
mandatory.
is
he
wrong,
in
your
view?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
would
be
true
in
your
view
even
if
it
were
the
application
of
a
city
fire
ordinance
to
all
buildings
of
a
certain
kind,
and
one
building
fulled
out
to
be
a
bookstore?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
answer
my
question.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
my
example
a
kind
of
speech,
legislation
that
could
affect
speech
directly,
in
your
words?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
hypothetical
i
gave
you
was
an
ordinance
which
applied
fire
regulations
to
all
buildings
of
a
certain
kind--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--including
a
book
store.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
does
the
application
of
a
fire
ordinance
to
a
building
in
which
there
is
a
book
store
affect
that
area
of
speech,
as
you
put
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
ordinance
says
you
have
to
have
a
certain
fire
resistant
break
on
the
outside,
you
have
to
have
smoke
detectors
on
the
inside,
that
sort
of
thing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
they
did
that
because
they
thought
the
first
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution
required
it,
didn't
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
read
this
statement
to
you
from
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
opinion
on
page
a-19
of
the
petition,
where
just
before
they
reached
the
end
and
judge
jason
starts
dissenting,
the
court
of
appeals
says,
"under
these
circumstances,
we
conclude
that
closure
of
defendant's
bookstore
is
not
essential
to
the
furtherance
of
the
purposes
underlying
title
2,
and
is
thus
an
unconstitutional
restraint
on
defendant's
first
amendment
rights.
"
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
and
under
these
circumstances
they
felt
the
legislation
could
not
be
constitutionally
applied.
