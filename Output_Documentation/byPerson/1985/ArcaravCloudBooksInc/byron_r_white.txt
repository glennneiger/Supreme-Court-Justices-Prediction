justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
injunction
was
to
close.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
wasn't
just
to
stop
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--the
illegal
conduct.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
there
is
no
bookstore
involved,
and
you
just
have
a
house
of
prostitution.
what
is
the
purpose
of
shutting
down
a
place
like
that
for
a
year?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
here
is
a
nuisance,
here
is
a
public
nuisance
ordinance
that
allows
the
city
to
close
down
the
use
of
that
property
for
a
year
for
anything.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
suppose
it
is
some
sort
of
deterrence--
justice
byron
r.
white
--to
prevent...
to
convince
people
that
they
shouldn't
run
houses
of
prostitution.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
am
just
talking...
just
answer...
how
about
my
question?
wouldn't
you
suppose
that's
right,
that
they
want
to--
justice
byron
r.
white
--they
want
to
make
it
expensive
to
run
houses
of
prostitution?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
that
the
operator
of
a
house
of
prostitution
can
avoid
that
deterrent
effect
by
selling
books,
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
your
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
here
is
a
house
of
prostitution,
and
he
also
runs
a
bookstore.
according
to
your
analysis,
you
could
not
close
down
that
house
of
prostitution--
justice
byron
r.
white
--you
couldn't...
you
would
have
to
let
the
bookstore
run.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
housing
the...
closing
the...
without
the
bookstore
you
could
close
down
the
property
and
it
couldn't
be
used
for
anything
for
a
year.
justice
byron
r.
white
with
the
bookstore
you
say
the
property
cannot
be
closed
down
for
a
year.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
there
is
a
provision
for
an
injunction
in
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
the
law
that
the
district
attorney
was
faced
with,
though,
wouldn't
permit
him
just
to
get
an
injunction.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
they
try
to
get
an
injunction?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
on
that
basis
you
would
never
get
an
injunction.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why,
if
there
are
adequate
legal
remedies
like
indicting
somebody.
that
is
the
end
of
the
injunction--
justice
byron
r.
white
--that
was
a
court
opinion.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
district
attorney
tried
to
get
an
injunction,
and
the
court
wouldn't
give
it
to
him.
