mr.
defranks,
would
you
mind
explaining
how
new
york
interprets
this
law?
would
a
single
occurrence
of
an
illegal
act
on
the
premises
of
a
business
without
the
knowledge
or
consent
of
the
owner
amount
to
a
violation
so
that
it
could
be
declared
a
public
nuisance?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
does
the
prosecutor
have
an
option
to
seek
closure
or
an
injunction?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
whether
or
not
the
owner
knew
of
the
activity?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
take
the
position
that
it
isn't
a
first
amendment
case
at
all,
so
we
wouldn't
be
concerned
with
narrowly
tailored
or
substantial
interests?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
court
below,
as
i
understand
it,
said
the
first
amendment
in
effect
forced
it
to
make
that
decision,
because
it
thought
there
were
first
amendment
values
at
stake
here.
isn't
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
the
sane
analysis
would
be
required
if
a
bookstore
were
closed
because
of
violation
of
some
safety--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
but
hoe
wait
a
minute.
suppose
it
was
fire
safety
regulations,
and
the
city
said,
you
will
have
to
close
because
you
don't
have
the
required
fire
safety
code
equipment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
are
assuming
it
is
a
first
amendment
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
cambria,
suppose
we
had
a
policeman
who
arrested
a
television
anchorperson
for
speeding
or
drunk
driving
just
before
the
evening
broadcast.
now,
does
the
policeman
have
to
take
into
account
the
fact
that
by
arresting
the
person
speech
will
be
suppressed?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
the
policeman
would
have
an
option
to
issue
a
citation
at
the
moment
and
release
the
anchorperson
to
go
make
the
broadcast,
or
to
keep
the
person
under
arrest
and
prevent
it.
