justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
question
there?
supposing
the
publisher
had
this
sort
of
activity
going
on
in
the
men's
room
or
the
locker
room
or
something,
and
didn't
know
it,
it
went
on
over
and
over
again
for
the
period
of
a
month,
and
the
investigators
found
it
out.
could
you
close
down
the
publisher?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
they
are
publishing
a
newspaper
or
magazine?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
cambria,
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
supposing...
as
i
understand,
the
case
comes
up
on
the
motion.
we
don't
have
a
trial
yet.
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
when
you
go
back,
the
city,
even
though
it
hasn't
alleged
it
yet,
does
put
in
proof
that
establishes
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
a,
that
you
could
move
across
the
street,
and
you
deny
you
could,
and
b,
that
there
is
no
other
remedy
that
would
effectively
prevent
the
nuisance
from
reoccuring.
could
they
then
order
a
closure?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
as
part
of
this,
i
assume
they
are
not
old
common
law
pleading.
they
could
put
in
extra
evidence,
i
suppose,
in
support
of
this
complaint,
and
if
they
convinced
the
trier
of
fact
of
both
of
those
propositions--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so
what
i
am
really
suggesting
is,
do
we
know
on
the
record
before
us
what
the
issue
is
going
to
be
at
the
time
the
remedy
is
imposed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
guess
it
is
their
legal
position
that
they
don't
have
to
show
that
it
is
necessary
or
that
there
is
some
other
place
you
can
move
if
the
statute
means
what
it
says,
and
closure
follows
automatically
from
proof
of
this
kind
of
activity.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
their
legal
position.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
they
can
just
say
the
statute
means
what
it
says.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
it
did.
they
said,
we
have
to
construe
the
fact
because
of
the
first
amendment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
wait.
mr.
defranks,
i
really
don't
understand
your
baking
this
argument,
because
am
i
not
correct
that
your
position
is,
you
don't
have
to
prove
anything
like
that,
that
you
are
simply
entitled
to
closure?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
seems
to
me
that
you
should
he
saying
to
us,
don't
bother
looking
at
alternatives.
we
have
a
right
to
closure.
it
is
an
effective
remedy,
and
so
forth.
so
i
just
don't
understand
you--
