mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case,
in
essence,
is
whether
the
customs
services
routine
administration
of
its
civil
forfeiture
responsibilities
violates
the
constitutional
rights
of
persons
whose
property
has
been
lawfully
seized
for
violating
the
customs
laws.
specifically,
the
issue
concerns
the
effects,
if
any,
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
on
the
administrative
consideration
of
a
petition
for
remission
or
mitigation
that
is
filed
in
connection
with
a
seizure
for
civil
forfeiture.
here,
for
failure
to
declare
an
automobile
to
customs
upon
entry
into
the
united
states.
pursuant
to
19
u.s.c.
1618,
an
individual
who
has
an
item
seized
for
forfeiture,
even
if
the
item
is
unquestionably
bought,
may
file
petition
for
remission
or
mitigation
with
the
secretary
of
the
treasury,
seeking
to
have
all
of
part
of
the
forfeiture
remitted.
the
secretary
has
set
up
certain
internal
procedures
for
processing
these
petitions.
in
the
ordinary
course
the
agency
will
consider
and
rule
on
the
petition,
giving
its
ruling
to
the
claimant.
if
the
secretary
determines
that
remission
is
appropriate
and
the
claimant
agrees
to
the
terms
of
the
proposed
remission,
the
matter
is
settled
without
a
judicial
proceeding.
ninety-five
percent
of
remission
petitions
filed
in
car
seizure
cases
are
settled
in
this
fashion.
if
there
is
no
agreement
on
remission,
either
because
the
secretary
determines
that
remission
is
not
appropriate
or
because
the
claimant
is
unsatisfied
with
the
terms
upon
which
remission
is
offered,
then
the
case
proceeds
to
a
judicial,
or
for
small
cases,
an
administrative
proceeding
in
which
the
forfeitability
of
the
item
is
determined.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
they
have
settlement
authority.
i
guess
in
some
ways
it's
used
that
way,
although
they're
not
the
prosecuting
authority.
it's
an
agency
thing.
they're
not
the
prosecutor.
but,
settlement
is
part
of
it.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yeah.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes,
i
would
agree
as
a
practical
matter,
that's
basically
how
it
operates.
the
reason
i
hesitate
to
agree
completely
is,
it
is
possible
to
get
remission
even
after
the
forfeiture
proceeding
has
occurred,
in
which
case
there
would
no
longer
be
a
settlement.
it
would
surely
be
a
matter
of
executive
grace
there.
but,
naturally
the
government
is
more
reluctant
to
grant
remission
under
those
circumstances
and
therefore
it's
to
the
advantage
of
claimants
to
have
their
remission
petitions
decided
on
by
the
agency
before
there's
been
a
judicial
proceeding.
the
background
facts
may
be
briefly
stated
as
follows:
on
january
20th,
1975,
respondent
attempted
to
bring
across
the
canadian
border
into
the
united
states
a
new
jaguar
that
he
had
purchased
in
europe.
when
asked
at
the
u.s.
customs
station
whether
he
had
anything
to
declare,
he
failed
to
declare
the
car
and
it
was
then
seized
as
forfeitable
under
19
u.s.c.
1497.
respondent
then
completed,
with
the
assistance
of
the
customs
agent
on
duty
there,
a
brief
handwritten
petition
for
remission
in
which
he
stated
that
he
had
no
intention
to
avoid
customs
duty.
the
customs
agent
then
helped
respondent
arrange
transportation
to
a
local
hotel
where
he
stayed
overnight,
and
from
there
he
arranged
to
get
home
in
his
private
plane
that
was
waiting
for
him
in
seattle.
two
weeks
later
customs
returned
respondent's
car
upon
his
posting
of
a
bond
for
the
value
of
the
car,
assessed
at
$24,500.
on
february
12th,
1975,
approximately
two
weeks
later,
respondent's
counsel
filed
a
more
detailed
supplement
to
his
remission
petition.
this
was
prepared
by
an
attorney
for
the
respondent.
thirteen
days
after
the
filing
of
that
supplemental
petition,
now
36
days
from
the
date
of
the
original
seizure,
customs
acted
on
the
remission
petition.
it
informed
respondent
that...
excuse
me.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
would
say
no.
i'm
using
the
term
"remission"
to
cover
both.
generally
remission,
i
think,
may
refer
to
remission
of
the
entire
forfeiture.
mitigation
is
a
partial--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--or
less
than.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
think
mitigation
can
also
mean
less
than.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
after
it
had
acted
on
the
remission
petition?
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
there's
no
question
that
the
government
could
have
forfeited
the
jaguar,
and
in
fact
the
ninth
circuit
itself
held
that
the
jaguar
was
forfeitable.
so,
the
only
reason
that
respondent
is
not
asking
for
the
entire
$24,500
is
because
customs
had
agreed
to
remit
some
of
the
money
to
him
as
a
matter
of
executive
grace.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
possibly.
i
can
imagine
a
worse
violation
of
the
customs
law.
in
general,
customs...
in
most
cases
customs
does
grant
some
remission.
now,
whether
that's
a
reflection
of
their
overriding
policy
to
try
to
avoid
as
much
litigation
as
they
can
or
just
the
recognition
that
the
penalty
set
forth
in
the
statute
can
be
a
rather
harsh
one--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--let
me
just
say,
it's
not
a
typical
act
of
generosity
on
behalf
of
the
customs
service.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
the
assumption
of
the
remission
petition
is
that
the
property
was
forfeitable.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes,
1618--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--provides
for
that.
the
claimant
doesn't
have
to
concede
forfeitability
in
filing
this
remission
petition.
in
other
words,
if
remission
petition
is
ultimately
denied
and
the
case
goes
to
a
judicial
hearing,
the
claimant
is
still
entitled
to
raise
this
defense,
that
it's
not
forfeitable.
he
hasn't
conceded
that
away.
but,
for
purposes
of
the
remission
petition,
the
assumption
is
that
the
property
is
forfeitable,
because
if
it
wasn't
there
would
be
no
need
for
remission
petition.
he
would
be
entitled
to
have
his
car
back
altogether.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
once
it's
decided
in
a
judicial
proceeding
that
it's
forfeitable,
it's
the
government's
car,
and
under
united
states
against
stowell--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--if
he
puts
the
forfeitability
at
issue
in
the
remission
proceedings?
well,
i
think
he's
entitled...
the
due
process
clause,
i
think
does
guarantee
him
a--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--how
can
he
put
forfeitability
at
issue?
he
can
do
it
by
asking
the
government
to
bring
its
judicial
forfeiture
proceeding.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
as
part
of
his
remission
petition
he
may
be
claiming
that
he
had
no
culpability
at
all
and--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--i'm
sorry,
justice.
i
guess
i'm
not
sure
what
you're
asking.
he
can
raise
the
claim
that--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--yes.
but
in
raising
that
claim,
he
is
entitled
to
due
process,
which
i
think
entitles
him
to
some
sort
of
a
judicial
hearing.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
he
may
raise
it,
but
when
customs
acts
on
a
remission
petition
it
usually
is
not
with
a
full
panoply
of
due
process
protections
that
are
associated
with
a
judicial
hearing.
so,
i
would
say
if
customs
rejects
remission
petition
because
it
has
rejected
his
claim
that
the
car
is
not
forfeitable,
that
is
not
dispositive.
he
is
still
entitled
to
a
judicial
hearing.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
what
i
am
saying
is
that
at
the
time
his
property
is
seized
he
is
entitled
to
a
judicial
determination
of
forfeitability
at
some
point,
if
the
government
is
going
to
forfeit
it.
and
i
don't
believe
that
by
filing
remission
petition,
or
even
if
as
part
of
his
remission
petition
he
claims
that
it
was
not
forfeitable
at
all
but
he
has
waived
the
right--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--for
smaller
seizures
it
can
be
done
administratively.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
this
was
$24,500,
and--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
today,
actually
the
limit
is
$100,000,
so
this
could
be
administratively--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--the
government
has
to
initiate
it,
although
the
claimant--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--that's
correct.
the
claimant
can
file
an
equitable
action
to
get
the
government
to
initiate
the
forfeiture
proceeding,
but
that's
right.
in
order
to
ultimately
forfeit
the
property
the
government
must
initiate
a
judicial
proceeding.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
believe
so.
it
satisfies
due
process.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
no,
there's
a
statute
that
does
it.
i
understood
justice
brennan
to
be
suggesting
that
if
there
were
no
such
steps
that
there
might
be
due
process
problems,
and
i
would
agree
with
that,
that
if
the
government's
going
to
take
property
that
at
one
time
belonged
to
a
private
person
and
take
it
for
itself
and
forfeit
it
at
some
point,
he
has
a
right
to
be
heard.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
as
far
as
i
know,
there's
nothing
in
the
administrative
file
that...
in
the
record
that
reflects
why
the
administrative
decision
was
made.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
it's
not
clear
whether
he
had
an
intention
to
defraud
it.
well--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
he
says
that
he
bought
it
for
his
girlfriend.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
don't
know
what
that
has
to
do
with
why
he
was
bringing
it
into
the
country
without
paying
customs
duty.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
no,
he
made
a
statement
in
his
remission
petition
that
he
did
not
intend
to
violate
customs
duty.
he
had
some
story
about
how
he
had
got
lost
looking
for
the
canadian
customs
station,
and
stumbled
onto
the
u.s.
customs
station
and
had
no
idea
what
was
happening.
i
guess
i
should
say
that...
finally,
in
his
supplemental
petition,
that
he
first
made
the
claim
that
he
hadn't
really
been
given
an
opportunity
to
declare.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
understand
you
to
be
asking
a
question
along
the
same
lines
as
justice
powell,
that
you
don't
understand
why
the
agency
would
send
him
a
check
for
$21,000,
and
i
understand
why
you
are
asking
that.
i
will
just
say
that
they
do
have
guidelines
on
these
things
and
this
is
not
completely
beyond
the
normal
reach
of
the
guidelines.
they
tend
to
be
pretty
liberal
about...
or
generous,
i
suppose
is
the
way
to
put
it,
with
these
cases.
the
respondent
in
this
case
wasn't
satisfied
with
the
customs
service
generosity.
he
was
a
little
bit
greedy.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i'm
not...
i
don't--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
the
guidelines
tend
to
go
to
first
offense
and
things
like
that.
generally
in
the
case
of
a
first
offense
they...
the
penalty
is
somewhat
less
than...
the
duty
in
this
case,
i'm
not
sure
exactly
what
the
amount
is,
but
it
would
have
been
something
less
than
$1,000,
so
i
think
customs
has
the
view
that
for
somebody
to
pay
25
times
the
duty
is
perhaps
a
little
bit
harsh.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
about,
yes,
maybe
four
or
five.
well,
so
customs
did
grant
remission
whether
they
should
have
or
not,
and
they
decided
the
penalty
would
be
$3,600.
they
sent
respondent
a
check
for
$20,900
after
he
filed
an
unsuccessful
administrative
appeal
challenging
the
institution
of
the
$3,600
penalty.
he
said,
thank
you
very
much.
he
deposited
his
remission
of
$21,000,
and
then
he
filed
this
lawsuit
in
district
court
seeking
to
recover
from
the
government
the
$3,600
that
he
had
not
been
repaid.
now,
on
the
first
appeal
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
he
was
entitled
to
recover.
the
basis
for
that
decision
was
that
the
passage
of
time
of
36
days
from
the
time
of
his
initial
remission
petition
until
the
time
the
customs
service
acted
on
it
violated
his
due
process
rights,
and
the
court
added
that
the
constitution
ordinarily
required
such
petitions
be
ruled
upon
within
24
hours.
that
decision
was
subsequently
vacated
by
this
court
and
remanded
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
8850.
on
remand
the
court
of
appeals
adhered
to
its
prior
decision
that
the
delay
here
raised
serious
due
process
problems,
although
it
retreated
somewhat
from
its
24-hour
rule
and
agreed
that
each
case
must
be
considered
on
its
own
facts.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
several
respects.
first
and
foremost,
we
submit
that
there
is
no
constitutionally
protected
property
interests
at
stake
in
the
remission
stage,
and
hence
there
to
which
due
process
rights
can
attach.
second,
even
if
there
is
such
a
right,
we
submit
that
the
course
of
events
here
could
not
conceivably
have
violated
due
process,
and
third,
even
if
it
did
violate
due
process,
we
would
contend
that
the
remedy
here,
which
is
returning
the
$3,600
to
him,
basically
eliminating
the
forfeiture,
is
quite
inappropriate.
the
primary
question
here,
the
one
on
which
i
will
focus,
is
do
the
protections
of
the
due
process
clause
which
apply
to
deprivations
of
life,
liberty
or
property
attach
to
the
remission
procedure.
another
way
of
putting
the
question
is,
does
the
remission
procedure
here...
that
is,
does
an
adverse
decision
to
the
claimant
in
the
remission
proceeding
deprive
him
of
any
property
interest.
we
submit
that
the
answer
is
clearly
no.
of
course,
there
is
no
question
that
the
respondent
does
have
a
property
interest
in
this
car
at
the
time
it
was
seized.
that
property
interest
cannot
be
taken
away
without
a
judicial
hearing.
that
judicial
hearing
is
what
gives
him
due
process
with
respect
to
that
property
interest.
but,
the
property
interest
in
his
car
simply
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
remission
proceeding
here.
the
remission
proceeding
is
collateral.
it
assumes
that
the
property
was
lawfully
seized.
it
assumes
that
the
property
is
forfeitable,
and
the
question
of
the
remission
proceeding
is
whether
the
government
will
give
to
the
claimant
either
executive
clemency
or,
as
an
act
of
settling,
to
avoid
litigation
whether
it
will
give
back
some
of
this
property,
property
that
really
belongs
to
the
government,
whether
it
will
give
some
of
it
back
to
him.
that
decision
does
not
deprive
the
respondent
or
the
claimant
of
any
property
interest.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
that
is
our
position,
justice
o'connor.
our
position
is
that
there
is
no
due
process
right
in
the
remission
proceeding
itself.
congress
could
repeal
the
remission
procedure
tomorrow
and
there
would
be
no
question
that
the
forfeiture,
general
forfeiture
procedure
would
still
satisfy
due
process.
i
think
maybe
the
best
way
to
look
at
this
problem
is
to
assume
that
customs
had
set
up
the
remission
procedure
a
little
bit
differently.
as
we've
explained,
the
remission
proceedings
come
first
the
way
it
is
set
up
now,
and
that
is
done
to
avoid
litigation,
but
customs
could
just
as
easily
have
said
that
the
forfeiture
proceeding
will
be
held
first,
and
let's
assume
that
the
held
a
forfeiture
hearing
the
day
after
respondent's
car
was
seized
and
the
car
was
held
to
be
forfeitable,
and
then
customs
said,
now
that
your
car
has
been
held
forfeitable
you
can
file
a
remission
petition
and
we'll
decide
whether
we're
going
to
remit
some
of
the
forfeiture.
in
that
situation
there
can't
be
any
conceivable
argument
that
there's
a
property
interest,
or
that
any
due
process
right
would
attach
to
the
remission
petition.
it
is
the
government's
property.
it's
been
adjudicated
to
be
the
government's
property
in
a
judicial
proceeding.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
he
has
a
property
interest
in
the
car,
but
it's
not
implicated
at
all
in
the
remission
proceeding.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes,
and
just
like
any
other
settlement
proceeding,
we
would
submit
that
the
litigant
has
no
due
process
right
in
whether
the
government
decides
to
agree
to
a
settlement
or
not.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
think
the
question...
what
he
is
claiming
is
that
he
has
an
independent
right
to
due
process
in
the
remission
proceeding,
quite
separate
from
the
forfeiture
proceeding.
the
position
of
the
ninth
circuit,
the
position
of
the
respondent--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--because
the
question
is
whether
the
government's
decision
in
the
remission
proceeding
involves
a
deprivation
of
property
in
any
sense,
and
the
answer
to
that
is
no,
because
either
the
property
is
forfeitable
in
which
case
it's--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well
that's
true,
but
there
are
all
kinds
of
intermediate
steps
in
the
course
of
a
proceeding.
there's
the
assigning
of
a
particular
person
in
the
customs
service
who
is
going
to
act
on
the
remission
petition.
i
wouldn't
suggest
that
he
has
a
due
process
right
to
be
heard
on
who
should
be
assigned
to
it.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
it
wouldn't
be
perfectly
all
right
but
it
would
be
perfectly
constitutional.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes,
that
is
our
position,
and
i
think
that
position
is
correct
justice
stevens.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
no,
it
does
not.
this
is
in
the
nature
of
a
settlement
of
the
litigation.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
but
he
doesn't
have
to
agree
to
the
remission.
he's
been
deprived
of
it
in
the
same
way
that
a
person
is
deprived
of
his
liberty.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
he's
given
up
his
right--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--he's
given
up
his
right
to
a
hearing
on
the
forfeiture.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
he's
chosen
to
do
that.
it's
the
same
as
if
there
were
civil
litigation
against
the
government
and
it
never
comes
to
trial.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
by
taking
the
money,
yes,
not
by
filing
a
petition.
he
has
the
choice
of
refusing
the
remission,
but
once
he...
at
least
until
this
litigation
we
would
have
thought
that
once
he
agreed
to
settle
on
those
grounds
he
was
giving
up
his
right
to
the
money.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
in
light
of
this
case--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--that
was
part
of
the
answer
to
his
suit.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
the
district
court
never
reached
that,
thought
it
was
a
simple
case,
and--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--defend
the
judgment
on
that
ground,
but
we're
not
that
interested
in
the
$3,600.
all
we
were
interested
in,
the
precedent
of
the
ninth
circuit
which
suggests
that
unless
the
customs
service
decides
all
these
cases
with
undue
haste
we're
going
to
have
all
these
forfeitures
thrown
out.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
no,
i
agree,
justice
rehnquist,
that
there
is
no
separate
right
to
due
process
in
the
remission
proceeding.
he
has
a
right
to
have
a
judicial
proceeding
before
the
property
is
taken
away
from
him.
he
can
give
up
that
right,
it
doesn't
violate
the--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
right,
i
agree.
there
are
two
questions--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--yes,
the
case
would
have
been
over...
well,
no,
i'll
take
that
back.
his
claim
is
that
in
taking
36
days
to
decide
on
his
remission
petition,
they
had
already
by
that
time
violated
his
due
process
rights.
so,
whether
or
not
he
would
have
agreed
to
the
settlement
or
not,
he
would
have--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
the
question
is,
by
taking
the
money
he
certainly
gives
up
the
right
to
have
a
forfeiture
proceeding.
he
ought
to
have
probably
stated
at
the
time
that
he
was
also
waiving
any
right
to
raise
any
other...
bring
any
other
sort
of
lawsuit
in
connection
with
this,
but
we
didn't
do
that
because
i
don't
think
it
occurred
to
anyone
he
could
bring
this
claim.
the
due
process...
what
you're
suggesting
would
not
solve
the
problem
that
is
raised
by
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
because
under
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
he
could
have
turned
down
the
remission
at
the
time
and
brought
the
same
lawsuit
and
won,
on
the
theory
that
the
36-day
delay
violated
his
due
process
rights.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
what
happened--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--we'd
get
the
same
decision
next
time.
we'd
have
the
same
in
the
second
circuit--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
but
in
johns
against
mckinley,
the
second
circuit
case
where
they
suggested
this
business
liability,
the
man
didn't
take
the
money.
instead
he
filed
a
lawsuit,
and
so
we
don't
have
this
defense
available.
and
he
said
that
i
think
it
was--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
that's
what
our
answer
is
in
this
case,
and
i
think
that's
what
the
court
should
hold.
i
think
i
should
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
would
like
to
make
a
couple
of
points,
mr.
chief
justice.
as
i
said
at
the
outset,
there
is
a
property
interest
here
but
that
property
interest
is
totally
taken
care
of
by
the
judicial
proceeding,
8850
is
what
applies
to
that.
if
there
is
some
probable
cause
question
for
the
seizure,
in
8850
the
court
said
he
could
file
a
rule
41-e
motion.
but
the
remission
proceeding
itself
has
nothing
to
do
with
that
property
interest.
there
is
no
deprivation
of
property
involved
in
a
decision
on
remission.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
it
would
go
to--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--it
would
go
to
the
probable
cause
for
the
seizure,
i
think,
as
to
whether--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--i'm
inclined
to
think
that
there
probably
would
be
some.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes,
i
think
rule
41-e
covers
that.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
our
position
is
that
there's
no
prompt
disposition
requirement
in
the
remission
proceeding,
so
i
don't
think
the
remission
proceeding
takes
care
of
it,
and
the
remission
proceeding
doesn't
go
to
whether
the
property
was
unconstitutionally
seized.
he
doesn't
have
any
right
to
any
disposition
of
the
remission
proceeding,
and
when
he
gets
a
letter
from
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
telling
him
what
the
outcome
of
the
remission
proceeding
is,
whether
it's
denial,
or
an
offer
of
a
certain
settlement,
a
certain
figure,
he's
got
exactly
the
same
property
interest
that
he
had
before
he
filed
the
remission
petition.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
a
factor
that
may
be
considered.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes.
well,
in
practice
they
do
consider
it,
but--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--no.
he
has
no
right
to
judicial
review.
he
has
the
right
to
petition
for
appeal
within
the
agency,
but
if
he's
not
satisfied...
if
he
can
come
forward
and
show
that
someone
in
the
exact
same
position
as
him
got
a
better
deal
out
of
the
department
of
treasury,
he's
out
of
luck.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
i
don't
know
if
it
would
be
permissible
under
the
statute
or
not,
but
the
question
will
be
purely
a
statutory
one.
he
wouldn't
have
any
constitutional
right
for
them
to
consider
willfulness.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
i
say
the
statute
imposes
no
obligation
for
them
to
reach
any
particular
decision.
i'm
not
sure
it
even
imposes
an
obligation
to
consider
willfulness.
i'd
have
to
look
at
it
again.
it
just
says,
if
it
was
incurred
without
willful
negligence
he
may
remit.
if
it's
incurred
without
willful
negligence
he
may
also
decide
not
to
remit.
so,
i'm
not
sure
that--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--i
think
they
could.
i'm
not
sure,
but
i
think
that
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
really
with
the
due
process
question
here,
justice
stevens.
there's
just
no
independent
right
in
remission
proceedings
to
due
process.
i'd
like
to
talk
if
i
have
a
minute
about
this
rich
versus
poor
thing,
because
it's
not
only
a
rich
person
like
mr.
von
neumann
who
could
bring
this
really
ridiculous
lawsuit,
it's
the
poor
people
who
have
their
items
seized
who
really
don't
have
an
interest
in
the
ninth
circuit's
decisions
here
because
those
are
the
people
who
need
for
customs
to
decide
these
remission
petitions
and
to
give
them
back
the
property,
most
of
the
property
they've
had
seized,
and
it's
just
not
in
their
interest
to
have
people
at
the
customs
service
looking
over
their
shoulder
at
what
is
likely
to
be
an
invalidation
of
the
forfeiture
by
the
ninth
circuit
sometime
down
the
road
and
acting
on
these
petitions
hastily.
now,
we
don't
say
in
our
brief
that
we'll
give
these
petitions
short
shrift
or
that
we'll
deny
them
all
if
we
lose
this
case.
we
do
say
that
the
due
process
clause...
the
constitution
doesn't
prevent
us
from
doing
that
and
certainly
in
borderline
cases,
in
cases
where
the
customs
service
doesn't
have
the
opportunity
to
investigate,
they're
going
to
be
put
in
a
position
where
they
act
on
these
things
more
quickly
and
less
favorably
to
the
claimants
if
they're
concerned
about
36
days
being
too
long
for
them
to
hold
on
to
one
of
these
things.
so,
i
do
think
there
is
an
interest
the
claimants
have
in
this
case,
but
it's
not
the
interest
that
is
taken
into
account
by
the
ninth
circuit.
thank
you.
