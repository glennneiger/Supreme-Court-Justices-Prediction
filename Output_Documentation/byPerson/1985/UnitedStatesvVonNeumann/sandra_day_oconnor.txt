justice

day
o'connor
mr.
horowitz,
is
the
remission
proceeding
basically
used
as
a
statutory
authorization
to
customs
people
to
just
settle
these
cases?
is
that
what
it
boils
down
to,
they
have
settlement
authority,
in
effect?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
it
just
seems
to
operate
as
a
practical
matter--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--as
agency
settlement
of
a
potential
forfeiture?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
horowitz,
it
seems
as
though
you
reach
exactly
the
same
result
if
you
acknowledge
that
there
is
a
property
interest
in
the
car
and
it
is
subject
to
due
process
protections,
but
the
forfeiture
proceeding
itself
provides
all
the
process
that's
due.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
birke,
there
eventually
is
a
hearing
in
connection
with
the
forfeiture
proceeding,
and
this
court
has
determined
that
that
proceeding
has
to
be
provided
within
a
reasonable
time
to
meet
due
process
concerns.
now,
why
isn't
that
all
that
someone
in
the
respondent's
position
is
entitled
to?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
just
like
a
settlement
authorization,
as
used
before
forfeiture,
isn't
that--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
in
the
normal
civil
litigation
setting,
why
would
there
be
some
right
to
force
the
government
to
settle
a
lawsuit
early?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
suppose
it
is
a
matter
of...
a
dispute
over
property
which
the
government
has
taken,
and
there's
a
civil
suit
that
arises.
is
there
some
obligation
for
early
settlement?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
birke,
wasn't
the
tacit
assumption
of
the
court
in
the
8850
case
that
regardless
of
what
happened
with
any
remission,
these
are
the
limits
that
the
government
will
employ
in
going
ahead
with
a
forfeiture,
and
we
recognize
in
8850
that
there
is
a
property
interest
to
be
protected,
and
i
just
have
difficulty
understanding
how
there
should
be
an
additional
concern
about
timeliness
of
the
remission.
we
were
assuming,
i
think,
in
8850
that
there
would,
regardless
of
a
remission
proceeding,
these
are
the
outer
limits
that
are
to
be
dealt
with
in
a
forfeiture.
