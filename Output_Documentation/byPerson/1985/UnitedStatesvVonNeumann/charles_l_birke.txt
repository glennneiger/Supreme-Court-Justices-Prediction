mr.
charles
l.
birke
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
the
first
question
you
asked,
mr.
chief
justice,
puts
the
case
in
the
proper
framework,
when
you
asked
counsel
whether
or
not
the
government
has
to
justify
forfeiture,
the
government
can
make
its
forfeiture
simply
by
administrative
fiat
or
having
seized
the
vehicle.
that
does
not
constitute
a
forfeiture.
there
is
no
forfeiture
merely
because
there
has
been
a
seizure.
there
is
no
finding
of
guilt
and
there
is
no
finding
of
fault.
the
only
way
that
there
is
a
forfeiture
is
not
by
the
government
acting
unilaterally,
but
by
a
judicial
proceeding
which
the
government
is
required
to
bring,
the
government
must
initiate
that
proceeding.
and
i
would
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
as
terrible
as
the
facts
may
be,
and
my
law
professor
said
argue
the
law
if
the
facts
are
against
you,
they
really
are
not
your
concern.
the
question
posed
by
the
ninth
circuit,
and
at
issue
before
the
court,
are
the
procedural
safeguards
that
are
involved
when
there
is
a
seizure
of
property
with
no
hearing.
not
only
is
there
no
pre-seizure
hearing,
there
is
no
immediate
probable
cause
post-seizure
hearing.
mr.
charles
l.
birke
the
reason
is,
your
honor,
that
there
is
by
code,
by
regulation
and
by
custom
one
integrated
procedure
here
which
i
think
you
pointed
out
or
referred
in
your
comments.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
petition
for
remission
is
the
very
first
step
in
one
process,
and
the
government
has
a
vital
interest
in
that
because
90
percent
of
the
cases
are
taken
off
their
docket
and
off
their
calendar.
what
is
the
expenditure
of
resources--
mr.
charles
l.
birke
--your
honor,
there's
a
difference
and
i'll
tell
you,
it
is
and
it
isn't,
and
the
"isn't"
is
the
key
point.
and
that
is,
even
though
the
person
might
not
be
entitled
to
a
particular
result
from
the
administrative
consideration
of
his
petition,
he
is
entitled
to
a
prompt
result.
he
is
entitled
to
know
where
he
stands
because
he
has
lost
the
vehicle
without
a
hearing.
mr.
charles
l.
birke
the
reason,
your
honor,
is
that
in
the
normal...
whether
it
be
government
or
private
litigation,
there
is
no
seizure
of
property
without
a
hearing.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
court
in
the
8850
case
and
going
back
to
the
pearson
yacht
leasing
case,
said,
we
know
this
is
an
extraordinary
situation.
mr.
charles
l.
birke
i
think
there's
an
obligation
for
this
reason.
it
is
established
that
there
will
not
be
a
judicial
foreclosure...
excuse
me,
judicial
forfeiture
proceeding
in
90
percent
of
the
cases
instituted
until
they
have
looked
at
the
petition
for
remission.
now,
if
you
have
a
due
process
right
to
a
reasonably
prompt
hearing
on
the
judicial
forfeiture
proceeding,
and
a
precondition
to
the
judicial
forfeiture
proceeding
is
the
consideration
of
petition
for
remission,
you
have
to
have
a
constitutional
right
to
a
reasonably
prompt
consideration
of
the
petition
for
remission.
otherwise--
mr.
charles
l.
birke
--he
is
led
to
believe,
your
honor--
mr.
charles
l.
birke
--i
suppose
it
would
have
been
possible
to...
on
the
basis
of
what
this
court
said
in
8850,
although
i
don't
think
it
was
particularly
clear
at
the
time,
that
he
could
have
brought
some
motion
under
rule
41-e.
i'm
not
sure
about
that,
but
certainly
the
court
has
strongly
implied
that.
but
i
don't
know
that
that
would
have
been
anything
prompt.
i
think
the
issue,
your
honor,
is
promptness
and
i
do
not
know,
and
certainly--
mr.
charles
l.
birke
--yes.
mr.
charles
l.
birke
well,
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
i
prove
it,
or
strengthen
it,
by
the
point
that
the
government
encourages
this.
in
fact,
it's
even
in
the
record.
the
government
encourages
the
petition
for
remission
as
a
means
to
the
benefit
of
the
government
of
getting
rid
of
90
percent
of
the
cases.
now,
if
the
government
says
to
you,
here
is
a
structure...
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
honor,
it's
been--
mr.
charles
l.
birke
--because
your
honor,
that's,
with
all
due
respect,
totally
unrealistic,
to
expect...
excuse
me.
mr.
charles
l.
birke
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it's
exactly
the
same
because
there
is
a
whole
panoply
of
different
interests.
it's
not
a
question
of
an
accused
violation
of
law.
this
court...
for
this
court
to
say
that
a
man
whose
property
is
seized
is
supposed
to
make
a
determination
of
weighing
what
is
the
quickest
procedure,
whether
the
petition
for
remission
is
the
quickest
or
rule
41-e,
which
of
course
he's
never
heard
of,
is
the
quickest,
i
submit
where
his
property
has
been
taken,
and
again
we're
talking
about
a
taking
upon
an
accusation
only
of
a
law
enforcement
officer
is
not
the
kind
of
standard
of
conduct
of
the
government
versus
an
individual
which
is
commensurate
with
a
rule
of
law
that
should
be
operating
in
the
country.
i
mean,
your
honor,
it's
obviously
a
question
where
people
can
disagree.
at
least,
i
would
hope
that
you
think
so.
mr.
charles
l.
birke
i
don't
know
what
he
considered
it,
but
i
think
he
never,
i
will
say,
never
considered
nor
was
he
told
that
he
was
making
a
waiver.
i
think
when
he
filed
the
petition
for
remission
he
was
advised--
mr.
charles
l.
birke
--your
honor,
again,
what
his
state
of
mind
was
this,
i
would
say
that...
it's
fiction.
what
i
would
say
to
you
is,
it's
as
much
my
guess
as
it
is
yours.
mr.
charles
l.
birke
but
if
you're
getting
to
settlement,
your
honor,
i
think
the
implication
of
your
question
if
i
can
get
the
direction
of
the
point,
it's
the
same
as
justice
white
made,
is
that
somehow
this
should
be
regarded
as
a
settlement.
however,
what
is
the
most
fundamental
principle
of
waiver
of
constitutional
rights?
it
has
to
be
knowingly.
you
have
to
have
advice.
you
have
to
have
some
notice
being
given
to
you
that
if
you
do
this,
there
are
consequences
to
it,
and
nobody
in
this
record
can
point
to
anything
that
says
that.
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
charles
l.
birke
but,
your
honor,
no
lawyer
could
have
said
that
it's
a
waiver
because
no
case
is
ever
decided
at...
if
this
court
decides
that
that's
a
waiver,
it
will
be
decided
on
an
issue
which
was
not
pled,
and
which
has
not
been
briefed,
and
which,
i
respectfully
submit,
is
not
what
the
government
took
the
case
up
about
at
all.
there
is
no
evidence
of
a
waiver.
a
waiver
is
a
knowing
giving
up
of
rights
based--
mr.
charles
l.
birke
--in
effect,
what
they
claimed
was
a
counterclaim
in
the
district
court.
mr.
charles
l.
birke
i
think
the
based
it
upon
a
claim
that
there
was
a
settlement,
and
it
was
not...
the
issue
was
never
reached
and
never
was
taken
up
by
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
mr.
charles
l.
birke
i
know
i
can't,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
l.
birke
well,
i
believe,
your
honor,
and
i
don't
know
again
what's
in
the
government's
mind,
is
that
they
were
hoping...
i
think
that
both
parties
here
think
the
principle
of
law
involved
is
more
important
than
the
$3,000,
and
so
i
suppose--
mr.
charles
l.
birke
--well,
your
honor,
i
would
say
it
raises
a...
if
you
were
to
find
in
this
case
that
there
was
a
waiver,
that
would
raise
a
serious
constitutional
question
and
i
believe
that
it
would
be
a
violation
of
due
process,
if
you
were
to
decide
in
this
case
that
there
was
a
waiver
on
the
basis
of,
it
is
an
encouraged
procedure
pursuant
to
a
statute.
nothing
in
the
statute
says
that
there
is
a
waiver.
nothing
was
told
to
this
man
when
he
filed
a
petition
on
a
government
form,
that
there
was
a
waiver
involved.
nothing
was
told
to
him
when
they
sent
him
a
letter
saying,
we're
remitting,
that
if
you
take
the
money
there's
a
waiver.
it
is
not
contained
anywhere,
and
the
back
of
the
check
doesn't
say,
in
full
settlement
of
all
claims.
now,
that
is
four
things
that
the
government
could
and
should
have
done,
that
they're
now
going
to
come
in
and
say,
there's
a
waiver.
and,
for
this
court
to
rule
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
that
a
party
is
bound
or
estopped
by
a
principle
of
waiver
when
there
has
been
no
notice
statutorily,
administratively,
or
correspondence-wise
or
on
the
check,
that
there
is
a
release
of
constitutional
rights,
i
believe
is--
mr.
charles
l.
birke
--they
don't,
but
i
understood
you
were
suggesting
that
the
case
could
be
decided
on
that
basis.
mr.
charles
l.
birke
oh,
all
right.
well,
then
i
misperceived
the
direction
of
your
comment.
mr.
charles
l.
birke
your
honor,
if
they
took
possession
of
it,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference,
because
he
had...
they
wouldn't.
i
would
assume
they
would
have
taken
the
necklace
the
same
way
that
they
took
the
car,
and
they
would
have
had
a
right
to
take
it
because
under
the
customs
procedures
that
was
cause,
in
the
law
enforcement
officers'
mind,
that
there
had
been
a
violation.
mr.
charles
l.
birke
i
would
say
it
would
depend
upon
the
factors
that
this
court
enunciated
in
8850,
and
the
relative
guilt
or
clearness
of
the
guilt,
the
second
circuit
in
johns-mckinley
pointed
out,
is
an
argument
for
having
less
time
than
the
30
days,
because
they
go
through
this
in
their
petition
for
certiorari.
they
went
through
all
these
factors
which
they
don't
say
they
did
consider
but
they
say
they
might
have
considered.
and
the
second
circuit
pointed
out,
if
guilt
is
so
clear,
why
do
they
have
to
take
so
long?
it
is
the
limbo,
if
i
may,
your
honor,
it
is
conceding
that
there
is
no
right
to
a
particular
determination.
it
is
the
fact
that
the
man
whose
property
is
seized
with
no
hearing,
that
is
the
basic,
fundamental
stretching
of
the
constitution
to
the
limit.
the
property
is
gone
because
a
law
enforcement
officer
thinks
that
there's
grounds
for
a
violation,
but
there's
been
no
hearing,
no
probable
cause,
no
determination.
so,
the
worse
the
offense
is,
makes
no
difference.
the
fact
is,
the
person
is
kept
in
limbo.
he
doesn't
know,
do
i
hire
a
lawyer,
do
i
put
up
the
bond
for
the
full
value,
do
i
go
buy
another
vehicle.
and,
what
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
second
circuit
did
in
their
decisions
in
johns
and
in
the
von
neumann
case
was,
they
said,
we
have
to
look
at
this
from
the
general
standpoint
of
prejudice,
and
this,
i
submit,
or
hope
is
a
point
that
deserves
careful
attention,
and
that
is,
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
are
not
the
most
significant
thing
before
the
court,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
government
hasn't
treated
it
that
way.
the
government's
petition
for
certiorari
contained
the
declaration
of
the
customs
official
that
wasn't
part
of
the
record.
it's
hearsay.
it's
like
he
was
testifying
before
a
congressional
committee
to
make
a
rule
of
general
applicability,
and
the
rule
of
general
applicability
which
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
second
circuit
decided
was,
what
is
likely
to
be
the
case
in
the
most
general
type
circumstance,
and
that
is
what
this
court
is
going
to
pronounce
here.
mr.
charles
l.
birke
well,
as
i
indicated
in
response
to
a
previous
question,
he
is...
he
may
have
a
right,
if
he
consults
a
lawyer
who
looks
at
8850...
of
course
it
wasn't
clear
then,
that
was
ten
years
ago,
but
he
might
be
able
to
bring
a
klevin
action.
but
the
point,
respectfully,
your
honor,
is
that
it
is
the
government's
duty
and
obligation
to
bring
the
forfeiture
proceeding.
and
now,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it's
codified
that
they
have
to
act
with
reasonable
promptness
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
1603
provides
that
the
customs
people
have
to
refer
with
reasonable
promptness
to
the
u.s.
attorney,
and
once
the
judicial
proceeding
is
instituted
there
cannot
be
any
administrative
consideration
of
the
petition
for
remission.
so,
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
the
emphasis,
or
the
key
point
here
is
the
fact
that
you
are
dealing
with
what
i
call
the
tipping
of
the
scale
or
the
stretching
of
the
seizure
right
to
the
very
limit
of
the
constitution,
that
it
is...
i
believe
justice
brennan
pointed
this
out
to
counsel,
it
is
the
government's
duty
to
go
forward.
we
have
already
said
to
the
government,
we
are
going
to
give
you
the
greatest
rights
you
can
possibly
have.
it's
an
extraordinary
situation
here.
you
are
at
the
very
end
of
the
spectrum
of
constitutional...
you
can
take
the
property
because
it's
a
customs
law.
mr.
charles
l.
birke
your
honor,
in
8850,
by
the
way,
at
page
566
and
67,
the
court
did
say,
unreasonable
delay
in
processing
the
petition
for
remission
could
not
justify
prolonged
keeping
of
the
property
without
a
hearing,
and
i
think
it's
going
to
turn...
whether
or
not
you
essentially
accept
the
proposition
that
it's
one
procedure
and
that...
you
just
can't
ignore
reality--
mr.
charles
l.
birke
--well,
if
they
do
that
i
think
they
have--
mr.
charles
l.
birke
--i
believe
that
they
may.
mr.
charles
l.
birke
no,
but
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
ask
the
court
to
probably
feel
that
it's
not
that
practice,
because
they
say
in
their
petition
for
cent
that
they
decide
85
to
95
percent
of
vehicle
seizure
cases
on
the
basis
of
the
remission.
i
mean,
that's
the
applicable
procedure
that
takes
care
of
this.
i
mean,
whether
or
not
theoretically
it
is,
the
judicial
forfeiture
proceeding
is
the
aberration.
the
way
that
these
cases
get
decided
is
on
the
consideration
of
the
petition
for
remission,
and
at
least
when
they're
holding
the
person's
property
without
a
hearing...
and
again
there
can't
be
a
judicial
forfeiture
proceeding
in
90
percent
of
the
cases
without
the
consideration
of
petition
for
remission,
and
if
you
have
a
due
process
plank
in
this
requirement,
that
the...
we've
got
to
have
intermediate
steps.
otherwise
it
disappears.
if
the
government
did
not
as
a
matter
of
practice
consider
petitions
for
remission,
and
it
was
the
aberration
or
unique
situation,
perhaps
the
point
that
you
raise
that,
well,
all
we
have
to
do
is
look
at
the
timeliness
of
the
judicial
forfeiture
proceeding,
is
important
but
that
just
isn't
the
facts.
it's
not
the
case.
mr.
charles
l.
birke
no.
that
is
right,
and
of
course
the
question
is,
is
he...
again,
we're
almost
in
some
sort
of
tacit
waiver
situation.
he
is
not
inviting
a
waiver,
and
i
think
that
when
congress
set
up
a
statute
that
even
the
agency
has
complete
discretion
as
to
what
it
will
do,
says
he's
supposed
to
act
reasonably.
there's
a
statute
on
the
books,
and
i
would
think
this,
your
honor.
i
would
say
that,
because
you
didn't
reach
this
in
8850,
but
were
there
not
a
remission
practice,
and
i
think
that
there
might
very
well
be
imposed
a
constitutional
standard
of
a
prompt
probable
cause
hearing.
i
frankly
believe
that.
i
mean,
you
have
never
had
to
address
that
point
but
if
you
are
sitting
in
a
situation
where
the
man's
property
is
seized
without
hearing,
i
don't
think
that
the
same
standards
which
you
laid
down
in
8850,
you
would
perhaps
lay
down
in
the
absence
of
a
remission
because
that
was
one
of
the
prime
factors,
or
a
factor
that
you
discussed
in
8850,
was
that
the
government
had
to
have
time
to
process
the
petition
for
remission.
that
is
one
of
the
factors.
if
you
did
not
have
a
petition
for
remission,
i
believe
there
would
be
a
very
serious
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
government
wouldn't
be
required
within
24
hours
or
36
hours
or
a
very,
very
brief
time
to
give
a
hearing.
certainly,
that's
a
requirement
in
any
other
situation,
and
why
should
the
fact
that--
mr.
charles
l.
birke
--no,
but
a
probable...
essentially
a
probable...
but
something,
something
other
than
the
fact
that
a
law
enforcement
agency
has
said,
i
think
there's
a
violation
here.
i
mean,
it's
still
fundamental
in
this
country.
mr.
charles
l.
birke
as
a
matter
of
fact,
no,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
charles
l.
birke
--we
filed
in
this
case.
this
case
does
not
come
from
the
government
forfeiture
proceeding.
it
comes
from
district
court
action
initiated
by
mr.
von
neumann,
because
he
felt
at
least
that
he
had
been
innocent
and
wanted
to
get
his
$3,600
back
because
he
didn't
want
to
be
branded
as
a
person
who
had
violated
the
customs
laws,
and
that
was
to
him
much
more
important
than--
mr.
charles
l.
birke
--yes,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
charles
l.
birke
--no,
because
by
that
time
the
due
process
had
been
violated.
mr.
charles
l.
birke
your
honor,
by
that
time
the
due
process
right
had
been
violated.
what
we
have--
mr.
charles
l.
birke
--he
got
a
lawyer,
your
honor,
after
he
filed
the
petition
for
remission.
he
got
the
lawyer,
i
think--
mr.
charles
l.
birke
--that's
right,
but
by
that
time
there
had
not
been
a
determination.
the
question,
your
honor,
about
accepting
the
check
and
raising
due
process,
i
think
would
perhaps
have
been,
perhaps
controlling
or
more
influential
to
what
your
decision
should
be
if
they
had
acted
promptly
and
they
had
said,
as
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
second
circuit
said,
in
automobile
cases,
decided
in
24
hours
or
36
hours
because
the
loss
of
an
automobile
is
a
very
important
thing
to
most
people.
now,
it
wasn't
to
mr.
von
neumann,
but
if
you
decide
this
case--
mr.
charles
l.
birke
--your
honor,
if
you
decide
this
case
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
mr.
von
neumann
wasn't
as
prejudiced
as
someone
who
was
poor,
then
you
are
injecting
a
principle
which
is
anathema
to
the
constitution.
mr.
charles
l.
birke
no,
the
point--
mr.
charles
l.
birke
--your
honor,
i
think
i'm
probably
confused
as
to
the
point
that
you
have
said
that
i
have
said,
because
i
don't
know
exactly
what
point...
if
it's
the
time
element--
mr.
charles
l.
birke
--that's
right,
and
it
isn't
often,
i
suppose,
that--
mr.
charles
l.
birke
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
charles
l.
birke
i
only
took
an
oath,
i
think,
to
do
the
best
i
can
within
the
law,
and
i
hope
i'm
doing
that
and
i
hope
that
nothing
i've
said
raises
any
inference
that
i'm
doubting
at
all
what
you're
going
to
be
doing
and
arguing.
but,
i
think
the
point
deserves
reiteration.
that
is
that
we've
heard,
perhaps
jocularly,
from
the
justices
about
the
private
jet
and
the
girlfriend
and
it
was
$25,000,
it
was
$36,000.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
if
this
was
his
truck
and
he
was
behind
in
his
payment
and
he
had
to
feed
his
family
on
it.
that's
why
this
case
is
before
you,
because
the
ninth
circuit
thought
that
way
and
the
second
circuit
thought
that
way,
and
that
is
how
i
am
asking
you
to
think,
to
be
thankful
for...
to
say,
what
is
the
general,
probable
result
of
a
situation
where
95
percent
of
the
time
the
government
decides
cases
this
way
and
it's
a
precondition
according
to
their
own
procedure
to
getting
into
the
judicial
forfeiture
proceeding.
mr.
charles
l.
birke
that's
correct
i
am
not.
mr.
charles
l.
birke
because
as
a
practical
matter,
i
think
we
cannot
ignore
the
way
things
actually
function
as
a
matter
of
practice,
and
they
are
the
ones
who
have
raised
that
and
have
brought
this
before
you.
in
fact,
the
whole
justification
for
the
petition
for
cert
is,
the
whole
system's
going
to
fall
apart.
we're
just
going
to
deny
everything,
to
use
their
words,
short
shrift.
i
don't
think
you
can
let
them
get
away
with
that.
i
don't
think
you
can
let
the
government
say,
we
do
this
95
percent
of
the
time
but
if
you
tell
us
that
we
have
to
act
with
reasonable
promptness
and
that's
all
we're
talking
about
here,
in
the
procedure
that
determines
95
percent
of
these
cases,
we're
going
to
take
the
ball
and
go
home.
i
don't
think
that
congress
when
they
enacted
1618
and
told
them
that
they
have
discretion
to
act
reasonably,
allowed
them
to
do
that,
and
i
think
the
fact
that
they
can
decide
the
case
however
they
want,
which
i'm
conceding,
of
course,
because
it's
true,
without
judicial
review
makes
no
difference
at
all
as
to
the
time.
it
makes
it
easier
for
them,
and
they
didn't
make
any
showing
or
attempt
to
make
a
showing
in
this
case
that
they
did
any
of
the
things
that
they
said
would
take
so
much
time,
and
i
think
that's
important
for
you
when
you
are
deciding
this
very
case.
in
the
petition
they
said,
well,
if
we
got
this
we
would
have
to
look
and
check
whether
he
was
a
swiss
resident,
and
the
use
of
the
car,
and
did
he
register
it
in
california.
they
didn't
do
any
of
that,
and
on
the
facts
of
this
case
ten
years
later
this
should
be
put
to
resolution.
they
said
this
is
a
matter
of
executive
grace,
and
i
don't
think
it
is.
and
they
said,
he's
the
same
as
a
prisoner,
and
they
cite
those
prison
cases.
he's
not
the
same
as
a
prisoner
because
nobody's
found
him
guilty.
nobody
has...
no
court
has
said
that
he's
liable.
no
probable
cause
hearing
has
been
held.
and
i
don't
believe
that
this
court
wants
to
equate
a
procedure
that
is
based
upon
a
seizure
of
property
without
a
hearing
to
a
man
as
if
he
were
a
convicted
felon.
it's
just
not
the
reality,
and
that
is
the
main
point.
and,
when
you
are
talking
about
an
estoppel
to
enforce
the
laws,
there
was...
the
property
was
gone
and
it
was
lost.
i'm
submitting
to
you
that
on
a
consideration
of
the
issue
of
waiver,
not
here
because
the
government
would
have
had
to
put
him
on
some
kind
of
notice
and
it
never
did
by
any
means,
and
that
as
a
practical
matter
he
had
a
property
interest.
the
government
concedes
it,
and
if
you're
conceding
there's
a
property
interest
and
that
there's
a
practice
which
as
a
matter
of
practicality
decides
90
percent
of
these
cases,
and
then
there
is...
which
comes
before
the
judicial
forfeiture
proceeding
which
is
mandated
and
is
the
only
thing
that
can
justify
the
seizure
and
there
is
no
justification
of
the
seizure
and
no
loss
of
property
interest,
until
then,
then
in
the
intermediate
step,
the
person
is
entitled
to--
mr.
charles
l.
birke
--that
is
totally
what
it
is.
mr.
charles
l.
birke
the
court
of
appeals
held,
your
honor,
that
the
test
of
the
court
in
the
8850
case,
the
four
factors
which
evolved
from
barker
v.
wingo,
this
is
what
should
be
applied
here,
the
prejudice,
the
delay,
assertion
of
right,
and
the
excuse
for
the
delay.
and
it's
not--
mr.
charles
l.
birke
--it
was
a
step
back,
your
honor.
in
the
first
von
neumann
case
they
said
24
hours
was
enough,
and
the
second
circuit
had
decided
that
in
lee
v.
thornton.
they
said
a
vehicle
is
so
important--
mr.
charles
l.
birke
--i
don't
know,
because
i
don't
have
to.
i'm
not
here
to
defend
that.
mr.
charles
l.
birke
i
say
this,
your
honor.
i
say
first
of
all,
the
court
must
establish
that
there
is
no
loss
of
property
interest
upon
seizure,
which
the
government
concedes.
second,
given
the
fact
that
the
person
has
an
existing
cognizable
property
interest
and
that
his
property
has
been
seized
without
a
hearing,
he
is
entitled
to
reasonable
promptness--
mr.
charles
l.
birke
--i
am
sorry?
mr.
charles
l.
birke
no,
they
left
it
to
the...
i
think
that
there
should
be
a
30-day
rule
for
this
reason,
it's
kind
of...
one
thing,
it
wins
the
case
for
me
which
is
of
course
the
most
important,
but
whether
it
took
30
or
45
or
60,
there
ought
to
be
something
because
we're
talking
about
conduct
of
the
administrative
agency,
how
they're
going
to
act
in
the
future,
and
the
lack
of
certainty
has
been
raised
and
some
questions
about
whether
the
government
officials
know.
so,
i
think
they
should
be
told
by
this
court...
you
should
have,
that
there
is
a
presumption
that
30
days
is
enough
and
then--
mr.
charles
l.
birke
--they
said
they
left
it
to--
mr.
charles
l.
birke
--no,
they
did
not
say
anything
specific.
the
court
of
appeals
said,
when
the
district
court
decides
whether
the
length
of
delay
is
prejudicial,
they
should
take
into
account
that
vehicles
are
very,
very
important
in
the
general
case
to
a
person,
his
mobility,
his
livelihood.
and
they
said,
when
you're
dealing
with
a
vehicle...
this
was
at
the
conclusion
of
the
opinion...
you
have
to
recognize
that
a
30-day
delay...
i
think
they
were
inferring,
and
i
think
they
should
have
just
decided
as
a
matter
of
law
instead
of
referring
it
to
the
district
court
because
i
think
as
counsel
does,
they
practically
told
the
district
court
what
to
do
here
and
i
think
they
should
have
done
it.
i
think
that
they're
saying
that
this
court
should
say
something
like
30
days
is
sufficient
where
you
have
a
vehicle
which
can
be
in
the
general
sense
an
extremely
important
thing,
and
unless
you
can
justify
more.
and
that's
the
third
point
which
is
your
own
test.
the
government
should
have
to
justify
if
they're
going
to
take
longer
than
30
days,
especially
when
they
go
on
the
assumption
that
he's
guilty
anyway,
which
is
not
the
assumption
that
the
claimant
makes.
and
in
this
case,
the
reason
i
think
this
case
should
be
resolved
without
remand
is
that
they
never
purported
to
act
with
any
constitutional
standard
at
all.
they
admit
that
they
said
it
was
executive
grace
and,
we
were
not
acting
with
any
idea
that
the
man
has
a
constitutional
right.
i
think
this
court
should
tell
the
customs
agents
in
the
future,
there
is
a
constitutional
right
here,
act
within
a
standard.
on
the
particular
case
involved
here--
mr.
charles
l.
birke
--my
client
posted
the
bond
for
the
$24,000--
mr.
charles
l.
birke
--that's--
mr.
charles
l.
birke
--that's
right,
your
honor.
but
then
that
just
has
to
bring
me
back
to
the
argument,
you're
making
a
rule
of
general
applicability.
you
don't
look
at
the
man's
bankbook
and
see
how
important
was
that
$24,000.
maybe
i
could
have
presented
a
record,
i
wouldn't
try
to
do
it,
that
this
was
the
man's
last
$24,000,
he
had
to
have
that
car
to
make...
you
know,
for
his
living.
it's
not
the
case,
but
you
can't
involve
the
administrative
agency
in
that
kind
of
proceeding,
as
to
how--
mr.
charles
l.
birke
--that
your
honor,
no
it
isn't,
your
honor,
for
this
reason...
well,
i
will
answer
the
question.
it
isn't,
your
honor,
because
you're
getting
into
an
implied
waiver
again.
if
you
say
you're
not
entitled
to
all
the
protections
that
you
have
when
you
lose
your
automobile
because
you
post
a
bond,
then
what
you're
saying
is,
if
you
post
the
bond
you're
losing
your
due
process
rights.
mr.
charles
l.
birke
i'm
not
certain
if
i
agree,
because
again
you're
saying
he
lost
some
rights
by
putting
up
the
bond.
mr.
charles
l.
birke
unless
they
told
him
in
advance
that
there's
a
different
standard.
mr.
charles
l.
birke
in
that
case,
your
honor,
that
might
be
the
case.
the
court
might
be
instructed
as
one
of
the
factors
to
take
into
account
that
the
man
posted
the
bond,
and
at
least
people--
mr.
charles
l.
birke
--thank
you.
