justice
byron
r.
white
--is
not
the
predicate
for
a
petition
for
remission
that
there's
been
a
fine
or
a
penalty
imposed,
or
that
a
forfeiture
has
occurred?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
what
1618
says?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
to--
justice
byron
r.
white
--once
you
decide
that
it's
forfeitable,
then
it
isn't
his
property
at
all,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
concede
that
if
he
puts
the
forfeitability
at
issue,
it
has
to
be
decided?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
can
he
put
forfeitability
at
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
may
he
do
it
in
the
remission
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
he
may,
but
may
he
put
forfeitability
at
issue
in
the
remission
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
files
a
petition
for
remission,
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
and
he
says,
please
remit
because
my
car
wasn't
forfeitable?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
he
may
raise
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
horowitz,
doesn't
the
government
have
to
go
forward
with
a
forfeiture
proceeding
if
it
wants
to
keep
the
$3,600
that
it
kept?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
he
has
been
deprived
of
$3,600
as
a
result
of
the
remission
proceeding.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
what
he's
really
done
is
given
up
at
the
forfeiture
proceeding
his
right
to
due
process
in
a
forfeiture
proceeding
by
taking
the
$21,000?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
that
right,
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he's
given
up
any
right
to
have
a
due
process
hearing,
with
respect
to
the
government's
right
to
$3,600?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
he
does
waive
his
right
to
a
forfeiture
proceeding
by
taking
the
money?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
was
he
notified...
when
you
sent
him
the
check
did
you
tell
him
all
these
things?
it
looks
to
me--
justice
byron
r.
white
--it
seems
to
me
that
should
have
been
your
answer
to
his
suit.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
aren't
you
claiming
that
up
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
you
could
defend
this
judgment.
you
could
say
the
judgment...
that
the
court
should
have
ruled
that
there
was
a
waiver,
which
is
what
you're
supposed
to--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
district
court
had
responded
to
your
claim
that
he
had
waived,
the
case
would
have
been
over,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
took
the
money.
he
took
the
money
despite
the
delay,
and
i
would
suppose
that's
what
you're
claiming,
by
taking
the
money
he
waived
whatever
due
process
rights
he
might
otherwise
have
had.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
may
be
so.
that
may
be
so,
but--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
if
you
won
here
on
waiver,
the
court
of
appeals
decision
would
never
stand,
the
opinion
would
never
stand.
it
would
be
vacated
or
reversed.
but
you'd
get
the
same--
justice
byron
r.
white
--any
time
a
fellow
takes
the
money
he's
out
of
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
your
answer
would
be
that
any
right
that
he's
got
to
due
process
is
satisfied
in
the
forfeiture
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
the
government
may
claim,
in
effect,
a
waiver
in
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
it
based
on,
that
there
was
a
waiver?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
may
be
so,
but
do
you
think
the
government,
either
you
or
the
government
can
force
us
to
make
a
constitutional
decision
when
there's
a
non-constitutional
basis
for
disposing
of
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
government
can't
either,
can
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
may
be
so.
that
may
be
so.
but
still,
the
district
court
has
said,
well,
the
case
is
over.
this
is
a
settlement.
now,
you
may
have
appealed,
but
it
still
would
have
been
on
a
nonconstitutional
ground.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
understand
the
government
to
be
arguing
with
you.
they
don't
want
to
argue
with
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
not
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
the
due
process
issue
here
a
"tough
time"
factor,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
did
the
court
of
appeals
hold?
justice
byron
r.
white
doesn't
it
give
some
advice
about
how
much
time
would
ever
be
permitted?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
defend
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
what
do
you
defend?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
that?
did
the
court
of
appeals
have
some
specific
period
in
mind?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
did
the
court
of
appeals
think
a
presumption
arose?
justice
byron
r.
white
five
days?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
are
arguing
somebody
else's
case
in
a
way.
because
this...
your
client
had
his
automobile.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes,
so
it's
really...
you're
talking
about
being
deprived
of
his
money?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
more
than
30
days?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
arguing
about
a
car.
that's
somebody...
that's
some
other
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
barker
against
wingo
goes
on
a
case
to
case
basis,
and
the
question
for
the
district
court
wouldn't
be,
how
long
should
the
customs
service
be
able
to
hold
a
car,
but
how
long
should
the
customs
service
in
this
case
be
allowed
to
keep
this
money.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
no.
it's
just--
justice
byron
r.
white
--it's
just
a
question
of
applying
barker
against
wingo
to
the
money.
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
anyway,
the
rule
takes
care
of
it,
doesn't
it?
