justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i'm
interested
in
the
same
sort
of
question.
is
there
any
explanation
on
the
facts
of
this
case
why
anything
would
be
remitted?
can
you
imagine
a
worse
violation
of
the
customs
law
than--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--it
seems
to
me
this
is
a
stupid
act
of
generosity,
but
it's
irrelevant
to
the
legal
issue.
well,
this
is
the
predicate--
