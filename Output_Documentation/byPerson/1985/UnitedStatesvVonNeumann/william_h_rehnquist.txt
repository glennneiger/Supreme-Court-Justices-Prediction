justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
saying
that
he
is
entitled
to
some
sort
of
a
due
process
protection
if
he
raises
the
issue
of
forfeitability
in
the
remission
proceeding,
or
are
you
saying
he
is
entitled
to
due
process
protection
if
he
seeks
a
judicial
determination?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
in
response
to
a
statute,
isn't
it,
that
the
government
initiates
a
procedure,
is
that
just
kind
of
a
constitutional--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
the
waiver,
if
that
were
the
government's
position,
it
would
be
a
waiver
of
the
right
to
have
the
government
conduct
a
forfeiture
proceeding,
wouldn't
it?
i
mean,
that
does
initially
answer
the
question,
is
there
a
separate
right
to
due
process
in
the
remission
proceedings?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
all
i
am
saying
is,
perhaps
there
are
two
separate
questions.
one
is
the
right
to
due
process
in
the
forfeiture
proceeding
which
the
government
would
institute,
and
second
a
separate
right
to
due
process
in
the
remission
proceeding,
and
the
fact
that
the
remission
proceeding
is
ultimately
settled
by
a
waiver
of
the
due
process
rights
in
the
forfeiture
proceeding
doesn't
necessarily
answer
the
second
question,
was
there
a
separate
right
to
due
process
in
the
remission
proceeding.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
the
consideration
of
the
petition
for
remission
a
precondition
to
the
institution
of
a
judicial
forfeiture
proceeding?
supposing
that
your
client,
when
this
property
was
seized
at
the
customs
station,
wanted
to
bring
about
the
fastest
possible
determination
of
his
rights
in
the
car.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i'm
not
interested
in
what
he's
led
to
believe.
what
would
he
have
done
if
he
knew
everything
there
was
to
know?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
you're
talking
about...
all
you're
really
claiming
is
the
prompt
right
to
a
determination
of
the
forfeiture,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you
can't
prove
that
the
remission
proceeding
is
a
necessary
precondition
to
that,
i
think
your
due
process
argument
is
awfully
weak.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the
government
sets
up
a
structure
and
says,
we
encourage
this
kind
of
settlement,
why
don't
you
go
through
with
it,
and
you
say,
it's
just
too
darn
slow
for
me,
why
don't
you
go
the
way
you
want
to?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
like
saying
the
government
has
to
plea
bargain
by
a
certain
date
in
a
criminal
proceeding,
or
like
it
has
to
promptly
reply
to
a
settlement
letter
in
a
condemnation
proceeding.
in
a
condemnation
proceeding
the
government
takes
the
land
without
a
hearing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there's
no
requirement
in
the
law
that
a
claimant
first
go
through
the
remission
proceeding
before
he
can
enforce
a
judicial
forfeiture
proceeding?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
only
in
probable
cause--
--not
a
determination.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
a
precondition
according
to
their
own
procedure,
you're
not
changing
your
answer,
that
it's
not
a
requirement?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
do
you
call
it
a
precondition?
