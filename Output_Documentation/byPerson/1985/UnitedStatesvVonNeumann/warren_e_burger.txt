mr.
horowitz,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
that
stage,
on
these
facts,
in
your
view
could
the
government
have
justified
forfeiting
the
jaguar
completely?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
no,
before
there
had
been
any
effort
to
mitigate
or
remit,
on
these
facts
could
the
government
have
taken
and
kept
this
jaguar?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--does
this
record
show
what
facts
were
alleged
to
lead
the
customs
service
to
exercise
this
compassionate
authority?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
it
pretty
clear
that
this
record
shows
that
from
the
outset,
he's
embarked
on
a
scheme
to
defraud
the
government?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it
seems
to
me
if
a
person
makes
a
return
and
has
a
number
of
purchases
and
he
forgets
to
list
or
declare
a
scarf
or
some
such
thing,
but
a
$24,000
jaguar
is
a
little
hard
to
forget,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
birke.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
try
to
clear
up
a
procedural
question.
suppose
instead
of
a
$24,000
jaguar
for
his
girlfriend,
he
had
concealed
a
$24,000
diamond
necklace
in
his
suitcase,
and
in
searching
the
suitcase
they
found
it,
and
he
has
made
a
declaration
that
he
had
nothing
to
declare.
now,
would
they
let
him
take
the
necklace
along
home
with
him,
or
would
they
take
possession
of
the
necklace
right
then
and
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
they
didn't
start
the
forfeiture
proceedings
in
36
days.
you
would
say
that
was
a
denial
of
due
process,
would
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
when
the
government
has
seized,
whether
it's
diamonds
or
jaguar
automobiles,
is
not
the...
they
have
seized
it
and
are
holding
possession
of
it,
does
not
the
individual
have
a
right
to
bring
a
klevin
action?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
responded
to
the
question
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
horowitz?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
