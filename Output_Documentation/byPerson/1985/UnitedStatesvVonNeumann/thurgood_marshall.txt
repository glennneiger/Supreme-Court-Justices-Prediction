there
a
statement
from

that

was
about
to
give
this
to
his
girlfriend?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
there
was
a
statement
by
him.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
thought
the
question
was,
did
he
make
any
statement
at
all,
and
you
said
none.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
did
your
client
consider
the
$21,000,
a
gift?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he
think
the
government
was
just
handing
him
$21,000,
of
my
money?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
fiction,
i
think,
is
probably--
justice
thurgood
marshall
maybe
we
have
to
get
a
new
lawyer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
about
the
time
when
he's
given
the
check.
could
he
have
then
raised
all
these
points
before
taking
the
check?
what
does
this
mean,
by
me
taking
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
he
have
then
filed?
could
he
have
filed
in
fact--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--that
was
after
he
accepted
the
money?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
couldn't
he
have
raised
all
these
things
you've
been
arguing
about?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
somebody
with
his
hand
over
his
mouth
or
something?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
he
had
a
lawyer
when
he
accepted
the
check?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
had
airplanes
too,
didn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
injecting
it.
i
didn't.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
did.
well,
why
don't
you
withdraw
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
took
an
oath
to
that
effect.
didn't
you?
