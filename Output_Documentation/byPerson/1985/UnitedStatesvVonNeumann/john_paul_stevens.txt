paul

wasn't
the
problem
that
he
thought
he
had
to
report
at
the
canadian
customs
rather
than
american,
he
allegedly
got
all
mixed
up,
and
i
don't
know
if
it's
true
or
not,
but
he
did
have
some
kind
of
an
explanation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
was
frivolous
or
he
wouldn't
have
given
them
$24,000--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
what
they
got
was
about
three
times
the
normal?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
the
only
question
is,
that's
the
very
point,
that
that's
not
what
the
government
does,
that
they
haven't
set
up
something
where
they
have
this
procedure
after
the
legal
determination
has
been
made.
at
the
time
this
takes
place,
he
still
does
have
a
property
interest
in
either
the
bond
or
the
car,
doesn't
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
remission
proceeding...
95
percent
of
these
cases
are
really
settlement
proceedings
to
determine
who
gets
the
car
and
how
much
he
pays?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
argument
is,
if
they
had
a
different
procedure
it
would
be
obvious,
but
my
point
is,
they
don't
have
that
different
procedure?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
we
really
separate
them
entirely,
if
95
percent
of
them
actually
end
up
settling
the
forfeiture
proceeding?
why
isn't
it
appropriate,
as
congress
did,
by
putting
separate,
you
know,
statutes,
why
isn't
it
appropriate
to
look
at
it
as
all
part
of
one
statutory
procedure
for
disposing
of
these
controversies?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--a
decision
in
a
proceeding
which
leads
either
to
a
deprivation
of
property
or
refusal
to
deprive
of
a
property,
and
it's
a
proceeding
that
takes
place
before
the
deprivation
has
taken
place,
and
it's
part
of
the
overall
procedure.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
of
course
is
a
very
separate
question,
whether
there's
anything
unfair
about
it.
i'm
not
suggesting
that,
but
your
position
is,
they
could
be
totally
arbitrary
and
they
could
give...
every
fourth
person
would
get
a
remission
and
every
sixth
one
not
or
something
like
that,
it
would
be
perfectly
all
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
you.
you
are
arguing
that
we
have
an
obligation
to
do
equal
justice
to
the
rich
and
the
poor
alike?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
in
that
connection,
just
because
of
a
suggestion
your
opponent
made,
supposing
you
did
away
with
the
remission
proceeding,
if
congress
hadn't
provided
for
it.
would
you
agree,
in
that
circumstance
there
would
be
some
kind
of
a
constitutional
requirement
for
a
probable
cause
hearing
at
an
early
date,
i
don't
know,
probably
not
24
hours
but
sometime
soon?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
but
even
then--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
either
rule
41
or
presumably
the
remission
proceeding
may
take
care
of
it
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
statute
says
that
the
remission
proceeding,
it
was
not
willful,
that
is
a
factor
that
should
be
considered.
i
assume
they
consider
that,
don't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
don't
they
consider
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
he
entitled
to
have
them
consider
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
could
the
department
adopt
a
rule
saying,
we
realize
congress
has
said
that
the
willfulness
is
an
element,
but
we've
decided
it
takes
too
much
time
to
consider
willfulness.
we
simply
will
disregard
it
and
just
consider
forfeitability?
would
that
be
permissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
earlier
i
thought
you
said
that
the
statute
imposed
no
obligation
to
consider
willfulness.
then
they
could
have
the
regulation
saying,
we
just
won't
consider
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
rule
is
saying,
we
won't
consider
whether
it
was
willfully
negligent
or
not?
they
could
have
such
a
rule,
though?
