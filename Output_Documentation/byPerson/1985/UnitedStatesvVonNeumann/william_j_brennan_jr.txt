is
there
a
difference
between
litigation
and
remission?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
less
than?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
mitigation
is
not
less
than?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
anyway,
mr.
horowitz,
there
is
no
forfeitability
procedure
except
in
the
district
court,
is
there?
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
let's
take
a
larger
one,
like
this
one.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
$24,000
jaguar.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
$24,000--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--whatever
it
may
be,
if
there
is
to
be
a
judicial
proceeding,
doesn't
the
government
have
to
initiate
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
if
there
is
a
remission
proceeding,
it's
denied,
then
the
government
has
to
go
in
if
the
government
says
it's
forfeitable,
and
go
in
and
initiate
a
proceeding
in
some
court,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
is
in
response
to
due
process
considerations?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
birke,
may
the
government
initiate
the
forfeiture
proceeding
without
having
decided
the
petition
for
remission?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
know
whether
the
practice
has
ever
been
to
do
that?
