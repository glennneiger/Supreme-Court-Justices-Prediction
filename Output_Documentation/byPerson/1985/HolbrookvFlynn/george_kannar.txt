mr.
george
kannar
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
a
trial
in
which
six
defendants,
over
the
most
strenuous
possible
objection,
were
forced
to
appear
before
the
jury
for
more
than
two
months
guarded
every
day
by
armed
and
uniformed
state
troopers
with
impressive,
military-style
uniforms,
wearing
holsters
at
their
hip.
now,
wherever
the
troopers
may
have
been
within
the
courtroom,
and
whether
we
are
concerned
with
the
style
of
the
uniform,
the
existence
of
the
side
arm
on
anything
else
is
irrelevant
in
this
case
at
this
point
given
what
the
record
makes
clear,
that
this
show
of
force
was,
a,
without
precedent
in
modern
history
of
the
state,
for
the
head
of
the
committing
squad
himself
had
testified
he
had
never
seen
anything
like
it
before,
and
secondly,
more
importantly
for
present
purposes,
a
show
of
force
that
was
labeled
extraordinary,
a
departure,
extreme
by
all
the
local
reviewing
courts.
moreover,
all
of
the
courts
reviewing--
mr.
george
kannar
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
george
kannar
well,
they
were
charged
with
charges
arising
from
an
armed
robbery
of
a
bonded
vault
company.
mr.
george
kannar
well,
the
kidnapping,
yes,
there
were
kidnapping
charges,
and
what
they
concerned
was
asking
the
people
or
forcing
the
people
who
worked
in
the
vault
to
move
into
the
men's
room
during
the
course
of
the
crime.
all
of
the
courts
reviewing
this
question
have
agreed
that
the
courtroom
security
measures
here
were
presumptively
prejudicial,
that
they
raised
a
serious
risk
of--
mr.
george
kannar
--well,
it's
a
little
bit
unclear.
the
way
that
is
phrased--
mr.
george
kannar
--sure.
mr.
george
kannar
if
i
may
elaborate--
mr.
george
kannar
--well,
first
of
all,
it's
quite
clear
from
the
record,
i
think,
that
the
defendants
did
not
waive
the
right
to
contest
that
one
area.
mr.
george
kannar
secondly,
if
i
may,
mr.
dickinson
just
conceded
in
the
course
of
his
oral
argument
that
the
only
reason
that
there
were
armed
guards
in
the
courtroom
as
opposed
to
unarmed
guards
was
this
very
fact
of
a
shortage
of
personnel
in
the
committing
squad.
mr.
george
kannar
that's
right.
mr.
george
kannar
well,
it's
unclear
from
the
record--
mr.
george
kannar
--of
what
their
uniform
consisted,
your
honor.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
george
kannar
no,
i
said
that
the
defendants
clearly
reserved
the
right
to
address
that
question
if
it
had
come
up.
what
the
defendants
consistently
argued
for
was
a
sort
of
compromise.
they
said
we
can
have
the
state
troopers
there,
just
please
put
them
in
plain
clothes
and
conceal
the
arms
so
that
we'll
know
they
are
there,
if
that's
what
the
issue
is,
but
the
jury
won't.
mr.
george
kannar
i
think
depending
upon
the
deployment
of
the
people,
it
is
conceivable.
we
are
not
contesting,
however,
it
is
not
our
claim
today
that
the
federal
courts
should
be
putting,
making
decisions
concerning
what
is
the
appropriate
level
of
security
in
the
ordinary
course
of
affairs
in
the
state
courts.
what
we
are
saying
is
in
a
case
where
the
state
supreme
court
has
explicitly
held
that
this
is
a
highly
unusual
situation,
a
departure
from
ordinary
proceedings
where
the
state
supreme
court
in
taking...
after
accepting
a
discretionary
interlocutory
review
that
it
obviously
had
no
obligation
to
hear
in
the
first
place,
cites
to
the
american
bar
association
standard
as
a
source
of
guidance
for
the
trial
court
judge--
mr.
george
kannar
--well,
what
happened
on
the
bail
proceeding,
actually--
mr.
george
kannar
--right.
mr.
george
kannar
well,
not
on
this
record.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
there
was
no
actual
consideration
of
bail
within
this
record.
what
happened
was
the
defendants,
as
one
of
their
less
restrictive
alternatives,
as
a
device
for
seeking
to
do
away
with
the
reasons
that
have
been
articulated
for
having
the
armed
and
uniformed
state
police,
asked
the
trial
judge
if
he
would
please
hear
an
application
for
bail.
what
he
held
was
not
that
they
were
not
entitled
to
bail.
what
he
held
was
that
he
was
prohibited
by
rhode
island
law
from
reconsidering
another
judge's
denial
of
the
application
for
bail.
further,
all
four--
mr.
george
kannar
--all
three
of
the
convicted
defendants
were
in
fact
immediately
released
on
post-trial
bail
as
soon
as
the
sentencing
was
completed.
so
it's
not
a
situation
where
that
there
was
an
examination
of
the
proclivities
and
tendencies
of
these
individuals,
as
has
been
suggested--
mr.
george
kannar
--well,
it's
clear
the
first
judge
who
considered
it
thought
so.
of
course,
the
first
judge
who
considered
it
wasn't
reviewing
it
in
the
context
of
a
possible
denial
or
infringement
of
their
fair
trial
rights.
secondly,
they
were
all
admitted--
mr.
george
kannar
--i
just
don't
think
it
was
foreseeable
by
the
judge
who
considered
their
initial
bail
application--
mr.
george
kannar
--well,
it
wasn't
unique
particularly
under
rhode
island
practice,
although
i'm
not
a
rhode
island
lawyer.
what
seems
to
be,
what
i
would
argue
is
the
judge
who
made
the
initial
decision,
who
is
a
rhode
island
judge
just
like
the
three
successive
rhode
island
judges
who
released
all
the
defendants
on
bail
following
conviction
after
looking
at
their
circumstances,
that
the
first
judge
didn't
foresee
that
his
decision
would
have
these
kinds
of
implications
for
the
men
when
they
went
to
trial.
mr.
george
kannar
well,
under...
i
can
only
tell
you
what
it
says
under
rhode
island
law.
under
rhode
island
law,
a
defendant
in
a
case
like
this
may
be
detained
if
there's
a
showing
that
it's
a
certain
kind
of
crime
and
that
there's
a
strong
probability,
i
believe
is
the
language,
of
quilt.
the...
subsequent
to
this
bail
hearing
in
this
case,
that
pretrial
bail
hearing
in
this
case,
the
state
supreme
court,
in
an
intervening
decision,
held
that
bail
courts
in
the
state
of
rhode
island,
even
in
these
cases,
have
a
duty
to
exercise
their
discretion,
their
considered
discretion,
to
see
whether
in
fact
despite
these
showings
and
despite
the
nature
of
the
offense
that
has
been
charged,
the
individual
might
still
be
a
good
bail
risk.
following
that
decision,
when
three
post-trial
judges
looked
at
the
case
again,
they
released
these
men.
mr.
george
kannar
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
kannar
well,
i
think
what
the
state
supreme
court
was
doing
was
really
making
what
we
might
well
regard
as
a
finding
of
fact
concerning
the
implications
of
this
enhanced
security
on
the
average
rhode
island
juror,
raising
thereby
a
presumption
which
needed
to
be
rebutted
or
at
least
justified
that
these
measures
were
going
to
cause
some
infringement
of
the
defendants'--
mr.
george
kannar
--well,
what
i
think
makes
the
most
sense
as
a
way
of
approaching
the
question
generally
is
to
try
to
think
of
it
as
possibly
having
both
a
sort
of
objective
national
standard
in
a
sense,
at
least
implicit
in
these
situations,
as
well
as
a
sort
of
local
rule
as
a
practical
compromise,
a
local
practice
rule
as
a
possible
compromise.
what...
i
think
if
the
governor
of
a
state
were
to
order
the
national
guard
into
every
state
court
trial
in
the
state
and
set
up
a
machine
gun
nest
with
a
machine
gun
trained
on
the
defendant,
regardless
of
whether
that
happened
in
only
one
case
or
in
every
case,
i
think
this
court
might
well
have
some
concerns
about
it.
in
the
meantime,
the
american
bar
association
has
articulated
what
seems
to
be
a
compromise,
a
workable,
sensible,
common
sense
solution.
mr.
george
kannar
of
course
not.
mr.
george
kannar
it's
not
that
federal
courts,
or
that
we're
asking
this
court
to
tell
a
state
that.
what
we're
asking
this
court
to
do
is
to
give
deference
to
the
finding
of
the
rhode
island
supreme
court
that
in
the
state
of
rhode
island
at
this
time
this
form
of
security
was
unprecedented
and
raised
very
serious
questions.
mr.
george
kannar
well,
the
supreme
court
of
rhode
island
in
its
refusal
to
reverse
these
convictions
re-emphasized,
in
fact,
that
the
courtroom
security
measures
were
extraordinary,
thereby--
mr.
george
kannar
--well,
not
exactly.
what
they
held
was
that
they
were
justified.
we
contest
whether
or
not
these
extraordinary
measures
were
justified,
whether
they
are
justified
by
an
alleged
union
contract,
by
their...
by
whether
they're
justified
by
an
alleged
police
regulation,
whether
they're
justified
in
the
sense
that
unarmed,
plain
clothes
persons
could
not
have
performed
the
same
job
just
as
well
without
raising
the
question
of
prejudice.
all
of
that
we
contest.
mr.
george
kannar
well,
this
court,
like
the
rhode
island
supreme
court,
this
court
in
estella
v.
williams
has
made
the
judgment
that
there
are
certainly
inherently
prejudicial
in-court
trial
practices
that
cannot
be
imposed
over
defendant's
objection
without
a
special
justification.
that
case
clearly
was
overruling
a
trial
judge.
moreover,
in
that
case
it
was
also
taking
into
account,
as
it
emerged
in
oral
argument
in
that
case,
that
the
judge
in
that
case,
like
the
judge
here,
had
conducted
a
voir
dire
of
the
jurors
before
empaneling
them
as
to
the
question
that
was
presented
there,
namely,
the
effects
of
trying
the
prisoner
in
prison
garb.
in
addition,
as
it
happens,
it
also
emerged
in
oral
argument
there
that
there
was
even
a
post-trial
federal
habeas
hearing
in
which
the
jurors
were
called
in
to
testify
and
testified
they
couldn't
remember
what
kind
of
clothes
the
defendant
had
been
wearing,
and
that
the
clothes
he
had
been
wearing
had
no
bearing
on
their
decision
in
the
case.
this
court
nonetheless
as
to
that
part
of
estelle
unanimously
held
the
practice
to
be
so
inherently
prejudicial
that
it
couldn't
be
allowed
over
a
defense
objection.
mr.
george
kannar
we
don't...
we
don't
dispute
in
the
slightest
the
need
for
courts
to
impose
security
commensurate
with
the
risks
that
are
presented
to
them
in
a
particular
instance.
i
think
in
illinois
v.
allen
there
was
a
very
substantial
chance
of
disruption
by
the
defendant.
he
was
doing
all
sorts
of
things,
and
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
the
court
was
unanimous
in
that
case,
too,
that
there
will
be
times
when
exceptional
measures
are
justified.
we
don't
dispute
it.
mr.
george
kannar
no,
our
position
is
that
the
state
court
having
made
a
finding
of
fact
that
these
conditions,
whether
it's
the
arms
or
the
uniforms
or
a
combination,
and
it
may
well
be
the
combination,
the
uniforms
are
very
impressive
uniforms,
as
the
court
can
tell
from
our
appendices.
mr.
george
kannar
when
they...
it
has
to
do,
if
the
court
would
consult
the
appendix,
what
it
has
to
do
with,
they
wear
sam
brown
bandolier
belts,
they
are
required
by
state
regulation
to
ear
that
hat
at
all
times
when
they
are
on
escort
duties,
as
the
major--
mr.
george
kannar
--it
creates
an
impression--
mr.
george
kannar
--well,
it's
a
psychological
effect
on
the
person
perceiving
it
as
the,
and
for
that--
mr.
george
kannar
--of
intimidation,
of
extreme
dangerousness,
of
something
extraordinary
going
on.
mr.
george
kannar
well,
i
think
what
the
three
who
were
acquitted
tend
to
demonstrate
is
that
this
was
a
relatively
close
case,
and
as
justice
marshall
articulated
this
morning--
mr.
george
kannar
--well,
there
are,
as
we
said
earlier
this
afternoon,
there
are
many
ways
to
speculate
about
what
the
effects
of
various
in-court
practices
might
have--
mr.
george
kannar
--it's
one
of
them,
sure.
mr.
george
kannar
it's
possible.
there
are
many
other
possibilities.
mr.
george
kannar
well,
it
isn't
conclusive
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
every
single
one
of
these
jurors
was
unaffected
as
to
mr.
flynn
with
regard
to
the
presence
of
the
troopers.
for
all
the
record
demonstrates,
it
could
be
that
they
acquitted
the
three
who
were
furthest
from
the
troopers,
and
convicted
the
three
who
were
closest.
mr.
george
kannar
no,
for
two
reasons.
it's
obviously
a
relevant
fact
in
a
one-defendant
case.
now--
mr.
george
kannar
--well,
that's
right,
but
the
problem
vis-a-vis
courtroom
security
in
this
case
would
have
been
solved
if
any
two
of
the
six
defendants,
not
necessarily
mr.
flynn,
had
been
admitted
to
bail.
the
articulated
reason
for
having
the
four
troopers
was
based
upon
the
two
to
one
ratio
set
forth
by
captain
melucci,
the
committing
squad
officer,
that
there
because
there
were
six
defendants
as
opposed
to
four,
they
needed
four
additional
helpers
from
outside
the
committing
squad
force.
had
the
trial
judge
considered
bail
as
to
all
six
and
held
that
bail
was
appropriate
for
two
of
them,
presumably,
at
least
on
the
articulated
rationale,
the
need
for
the
troopers
would
have
disappeared
as
to
all
six.
mr.
george
kannar
well,
there
was,
among
other
things,
those
facts
were
not
relied
upon
by
the
trial
court,
nor,
as
i
say,
is
it--
mr.
george
kannar
--simply
a
decision
regarding
his
personal
eligibility
or
appropriateness
for
bail
that
governs
the
courtroom
security
side
of
the
case.
mr.
george
kannar
it
would
be
relevant
in
a
bail
determination
regarding
mr.
flynn,
to
be
sure.
that,
however--
mr.
george
kannar
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
george
kannar
well,
if
mr.
flynn
had
been
the
only
defendant,
sure,
but
in
this
case
there
were
five
other
defendants,
and
if
any
two
of
them
had
been
released
from
bail
under
the
theory
and
under
the
record
here--
mr.
george
kannar
--well,
the
others,
if
they
had
been
released
on
bail,
the
articulated
basis
for
having
the
troopers
there
would
have
disappeared.
mr.
george
kannar
well,
i
don't
think
that's...
that's
disputed
in
a
serious
way
by
the
defendants
even
at
trial.
what
they
said
was,
trying
to
work
our
a
practical
compromise
i
think
was
if
you
need
to
do
this,
if
you
feel
you
have
to
do
this,
why
can't
it
be
done
in
a
less
intrusive,
a
less
impressive
manner.
mr.
george
kannar
well,
in
fact,
even
the
head
of
the
committing
squad
requested
the
state
troopers
leave
their
arms
outside
the
courtroom.
mr.
george
kannar
well,
there
was
an
assertion
by
one
of
the
witnesses,
the
state
police
major,
that
trooper
never
takes
off
his
weapon
anywhere.
however,
and
the
state
supreme
court,
in
reviewing
the
case
on
direct
appeal,
referred
to
an
alleged
state
police
regulation
requiring
them
to
wear
their
firearms.
there
is
no
such
regulation.
mr.
george
kannar
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor.
mr.
george
kannar
well,
it
did,
it
does
require
that.
now,
we
maintain
that
this
court's
holding
in
estelle
that
administrative
convenience
cannot
justify
the
imposition
of
prison
clothes
over
an
objecting
defendant
governs
the
same
standard
is
the
applicable
standard
in
cases
involving
enhanced
courtroom
security.
the
only
question
here
is
a
legal
question,
whether
the
measures
were
legally
justified,
that
the
convenience
of
the
guards
and
the
jury--
mr.
george
kannar
--well,
we
mean
as
a
question
of
law
that
there
was
a
sufficient
basis
relating
to
the
special
circumstances
presented
by
this
case,
these
defendants,
relating
to
courtroom
security
per
se,
that
justified
enhancing
the
in-court
security.
we
in
addition
say
that
once
a
criminal
defendant's
fair
trial
rights

that

hold

was
it
cured

remedied
