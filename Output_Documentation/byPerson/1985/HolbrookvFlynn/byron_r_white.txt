justice
byron
r.
white
but
directly
behind
that,
behind
the
defendants,
or
does
the
record
show?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
could
be
they
were
on
the
other
side
of
the
front
row?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
might
have
been
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
from
the
defendants.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
doesn't
reflect
where
they
were,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
bail
was
denied,
that's
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
would
suggest
that
there
were
at
least
four
defense
counsel?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
the
trial.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
is
that
clear
in
the
record,
that
if
there
had
been
enough
nonuniformed
people
available,
would
they
have
been
in
the
courtroom
and
seated
in
roughly
the
same
place?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
i
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
you
just
said,
you
just
said
that
this
wasn't
enhanced
security,
this
was
just
normal
security.
justice
byron
r.
white
except
for
the
fact
that
they
were
uniformed
and
armed.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
you
asking
us
to
believe
that
in
this
particular
trial
there
always
would
have
been
security
people
seated
in
the
courtroom.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
a
case
like
this.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
there
have
been
four
or--
justice
byron
r.
white
--was
that
the
general
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
first
argument
is
you
want
it
reversed,
isn't
it?
you
want
it
reversed.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
all
right,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
without
the
necessity
for
a
new
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
yes,
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
know,
i
gathered
that
the
general
rule
of
the
marshals'
service
was
that
it's
two
security
persons
for
each
defendant?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
it
possible
that
was
the
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
may
be--
justice
byron
r.
white
--it
may
be
that
if,
it
may
be
that
wholly
aside,
if
the
troopers
hadn't
been
needed
to
augment,
it
may
be
that
there
would
have
been
12
security
persons
in
the
room.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
understand
that,
but
how
about
my
question?
if
they
hadn't
been
needed
to
augment,
if
there
had
been
enough
unarmed
marshals
available,
there
might
have
been
twelve
in
the
courtroom.
justice
byron
r.
white
uniformed.
and
there
had
been
no
complaint?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
wouldn't
have
made
a
complaint.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
have
complained
if
there
had
been
12
uniformed
but
unarmed
security
persons
in
the
room.
