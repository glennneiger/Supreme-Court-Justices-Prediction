unknown
speaker
well,
what
were
they
charged
with
again?
unknown
speaker
what
were
they
charged
with?
unknown
speaker
the
hat
scares
people?
unknown
speaker
an
impression
of
what?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
the
psychological
effect?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
the
three
who
were
acquitted?
it
was
a
selective
fear,
if
it
was
there.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
this
also
might
demonstrate...
you
are
answering
a
different
question.
my
question
is,
is
not
the
fact
that
three
of
them
were
acquitted
at
least
some
intimation
that
the
jurors
were
not
intimidated
by
the
presence
of
uniformed
officers?
unknown
speaker
but
that's
one
of
them,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
that
they
were
not
intimidated.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
it
more
than
possible,
isn't
it
conclusive?
unknown
speaker
do
you
consider
the
past
criminal
record
of
flynn
as
being
relevant
at
all
to
the
opinion
of
the
judge
that
security
was
needed
in
the
courtroom?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
got
into
the
record
in
the
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
record
shows
that
flynn
had
been
convicted
of
prior
convictions
for
assault
and
battery,
for
armed
robbery,
and
was
an
escapee
from
a
massachusetts
prison.
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--that
could,
may
very
well
have
been
correct
in
the
absence
of
that
sort
of
criminal
record,
in
light
of
the
crimes
with
which
these
defendants
were
charged,
but
having
in
mind
that
record,
i
would
think
it
would
be
relevant,
but
i
take
it
you
do
not.
unknown
speaker
not
relevant
to
the
courtroom
security?
unknown
speaker
not
relevant
to
the
courtroom
security?
unknown
speaker
well,
five,
making
a
total
of
six,
would
call
for
more
handlers,
would
it
not,
in
case
they
tried
to
disrupt
the
courtroom?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
just
talking
about
the
numbers.
with
six
defendants
and
the
usual
ratio
of
two
guards
for
every
defendant,
there
certainly
was
a
need
for
some
manpower,
was
there
not?
unknown
speaker
was
a
request,
was
a
request
made
for
having
the
officers
leave
their
firearms
outside
the
courtroom?
unknown
speaker
but
there
was
some
state
trooper
rule
that
they
had
to
wear
their
weapon,
wasn't
there?
unknown
speaker
it
also
required
them
to
wear
their
hats
you've
been
complaining
about.
unknown
speaker
the
rules
also
require
them
to
wear
that
big
hat
that
you
were
complaining
about.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean
by
the
term
"legally
justified"?
unknown
speaker
uniformed
marshals.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
ten
o'clock
[=
10:00].
