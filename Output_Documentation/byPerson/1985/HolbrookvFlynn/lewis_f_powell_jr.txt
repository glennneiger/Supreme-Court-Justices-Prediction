powell,

in
connection
with
what
you
and
justice
rehnquist
are
discussing,
the
district
court...
and
i
am
looking
at
page
b-12
of
the
petition
for
certiorari--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--the
first
full
paragraph
goes
on
to
say
"to
repeat
the
characterization
employed
by
the
rhode
island
supreme
court,
the
circumstances
of
this
trial
were
veritably
"extraordinary".
"
"and,
the
need
for,
end
extent
of,
security
measures
are
generally
held
to
be
within
the
sound
discretion
of
the
trial
court.
"
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
wonder
if
that
doesn't
answer
to
some
extent
justice
rehnquist's
question.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
this
case,
the
district
court
so
found.
has
that
finding
been
found
clearly
erroneous?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
all
right--
and
that
same
judge
went
on
to
conclude
that
the
necessity
for
heightened
security
for
this
trial
was
manifest,
the
last
line
on
that
page.
justice

the
judge
found
there
was

that

to
