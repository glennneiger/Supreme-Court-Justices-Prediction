mr.
dickinson,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
many
defendants
were
there
being
tried
at
that
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--they
acquitted
three
of
the...
they
acquitted
three
of
the
defendants,
so
they,
apparently
they
must
have
had
a
selective
feeling
if
there
was
any
feeling
at
all.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
kannar?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
the
evidence
of
the
trial
judge's
denying
bail
part
of
this
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
know
that
it
was
denied.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
are
the
reasons
given?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--why
did
the
first
judge--
--well,
someone
thought
they
weren't
good
candidates
for
bail
at
the
outset.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
but
you
suggest
that
their
denial,
that
the
reasons
for
denying
bail
have
no
bearing
on
the
need
for
the
presence
of
guards
in
the
courtroom?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
in
this
day
of
almost
everyone
being
free
on
bail,
that
was
a
rather
unique
thing,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
was
the
prejudice--
--do
you
have
in
mind
a
case--
--excuse
me.
do
you
have
in
mind
the
case
about
1970
in
this
court
where
the
defendant
was
bound
and
gagged--
--and
gagged.
--and
tied
up
in
the
court
room?
justice
black
wrote
the
opinion.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
dickinson?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
