mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
the
case
of
holbrook
v.
moran...
holbrook
and
moran
v.
flynn
which
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
a
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit,
which
court
granted
a
writ
habeas
corpus
to
charles
flynn.
the
question
before
the
court
today
is
whether
the
first
circuit
committed
error
in
concluding
that
the
presence
of
armed
rhode
island
state
troopers
in
the
courtroom
during
flynn's
trial
deprived
flynn
of
a
fair
trial
by
interfering
with
his
presumption
of
innocence.
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
mr.
chief
justice,
there
were
six
defendants
on
trial
at
the
time
this
case
went
to
trial
in
providence,
rhode
island.
three
of
the
defendants...
all
defendants
were
on
trial
together.
three
of
them
were
acquitted.
flynn
and
two
co-defendants
were
convicted.
in
my
argument
today--
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
--your
honor,
the
record--
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
--your
honor,
it
would
appear
that
the
record
does
not
specifically
reflect
where
the
officers
were
at
all
points
in
time.
it
is
my
understanding,
however,
your
honor,
that
the
state
troopers
were
located
in
the
front
row
of
the
spectator
section
of
the
courtroom.
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
and
if
i
were
to
use
this
courtroom
as
an
illustration,
i
think
it
would
be
a
perfect
illustration.
the
defendants
would
be
seated
in
the
back
row
of
the
counsel
section
with
their
attorneys--
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
--and
the
troopers
would
be
seated
in
the
front
row
of
the
spectator
section
behind,
if
you
will,
the
bar,
what
we
refer
to
in
rhode
island
as
the
bar.
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
the
record
does
not
specifically
address
where
they
were.
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
it's
unquestioned,
your
honor,
that
they
were
seated
in
the
front
row
of
the
spectator
section.
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
they
might
have
been.
the
record
would
not
reflect
such
a
finding.
it
would
appear--
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
--it
merely
reflects
that
they
were
outside
the
bar.
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
and
the
defendants
were
inside
the
bar.
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
i
will
be
addressing
two
questions
in
my
argument
today.
first
i
will
address
the
manner
in
which
the
trial
justice
conducted
the
hearing
that
concluded
that
the
presence
of
the
troopers
was
permissible,
and
then
i
will
address
the
broader
question
of
whether
flynn
in
this
case
was
denied
a
fair
trial.
i
would
briefly
like
to
review
some
of
the
important
facts.
this
was
a
four
month
long
trial
that
occurred
in
the
summer
of
1976
in
providence,
rhode
island.
the
case
involved
a
major
robbery,
perhaps
one
of
the
most
celebrated
trials
ever
in
rhode
island
history,
the
robbery
of
the
bonded
vault
warehouse
in
providence,
rhode
island.
in
addition
to
armed
robbery
charges,
there
were
kidnapping
charges
and
weapons
charges
against,
lodged
against
the
defendants.
there
were
actually
eight
co-defendants
in
this
case.
two
of
them,
however,
were
not
tried
with
flynn
and
the
others
because
they
were
at
large
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
those
were
defendants
macaskill
and
lanou.
five
other
defendants
were
tried
with
flynn,
as
i
pointed
out
earlier,
so
six
defendants
were
tried
together.
three
were
convicted
and
three
were
acquitted
at
this
trial.
all
of
the
defendants
at
this
trial
were
held
without
bail
and
therefore
were,
under
rhode
island
law,
in
the
custody
of
the
rhode
island
state
marshal.
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
it
was
that
they,
they
were...
the
trial
court
would
not
allow
them
to
be
free,
and
perhaps
this
is...
this
may
be
an
esoteric
point
of
rhode
island
law.
however,
these
defendants
were
specifically
determined
prior
to
trial
not
to
be
entitled
to
bail.
so
it
wasn't
a
situation
where
they
were
indigent
defendants
who
couldn't
afford
to
make
bail,
as
perhaps
this
court
referred
to
in
the
estelle
v.
williams
case
where
you
might
have
an
equal
protection
concern
where
the...
because
the
only
reason
the
defendants
is...
defendant
is
in
custody--
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
--bail
was
denied,
that's
correct,
your
honor,
prior
to
trial.
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
my
recollection
is
that
flynn
and
another
defendant
shared
counsel.
i'm
not
sure
which
other
defendant
that
was,
your
honor.
i
believe
it
was
one
of
the
defendants
who
was
acquitted.
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
oh,
there
were
at
least
four
defense
counsel,
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
and
there
were
also
two
prosecutors,
i
believe,
in
the
courtroom
at
all
times.
two
participants
in
the
robbery
who
were
never
charged
as
defendants,
messrs.
dussault
and
danese,
also
participated
in
the
trial
by
testifying
against
flynn
and
his
co-defendants.
they
had
turned
state's
evidence
and
were
within
the
protection
of
rhode
island
authorities,
so
that
as
this
trial
began,
it
became
clear
that
this
was
an
unusual
circumstances...
unusual
circumstance,
first
of
all,
because
of
the
large
number
of
defendants.
it
became
clear
to
the
individuals
charged
with
maintaining
custody
of
these
defendants
that
with
the
force
of
marshals
that
they
had
at
their
disposal,
they
could
not
maintain
the
proper
ratio
of
security
personnel
to
defendants
in
the
courtroom.
the
state
marshals,
if
you
will,
were
numerically
incapable
of
serving
at
this
trial.
there
were,
at
the
time
of
this
trial,
there
were
eleven
marshals
in
rhode
island,
eleven
available
in
providence
county,
i
should
say,
to
service
this
trial.
the
head
of
the
marshals
service,
mr.
melucci,
testified
at
a
pretrial
hearing,
and
his
testimony
was
that
at
all
times
during
the
course
of
a
criminal
trial,
when
defendants
who
are
being
held
without
bail
are
on
trial,
at
all
times
the
marshals
attempt
to
maintain
a
ratio
of
two
security
personnel
to
one
defendant.
now,
it
would
appear--
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
--i
suppose
you
might
say,
your
honor,
that
there
were
two
reviews.
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
that's
true,
that's
true.
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
i
would
submit,
your
honor,
that
there's
nothing...
the
state
appellate
court
did
not,
did
not
cite
anything
specifically
referenced
to
these
defendants
with
regard
to,
if
you
will,
heightened
security.
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
well,
it
certainly
focused
on
those
aspects,
your
honor,
and
perhaps
the
reason
for
that
is
that
what
the...
the
purpose
of
the
security
force
was
not
enhanced
security
at
all
but
was
to
provide
normal
security,
and
the
only
way
that
normal
security
could
be
provided
was
to
enhance
it
with
some
outside
service.
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
well,
i
don't
think
the
record
specifically
speaks
to
nonuniformed
personnel
for
the
reason
that
the
issue
that
was
presented
to
the
trial
judge
was
state
troopers.
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
as
opposed
to
state
marshals,
and
of
course,
state
marshals
are
uniformed.
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
normal
security
with
unusual
personnel.
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
and
armed.
and
uniformed
in
and
of
itself,
i
would
suggest,
is
not
unusual
at
all
because
the
state
marshals
are
quite
clearly
uniformed.
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
in
any
case,
your
honor,
there
would
be
a
certain--
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
--there
would
have...
the
security
forces
would
have
maintained,
attempted
to
maintain
a
two
to
one
ratio,
so
in
a
case
where
you
had
one
defendant,
there
would
be
two.
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
the
general
goal,
your
honor,
was
a
two
to
one
ratio.
it
was
appear...
it
would
appear
that
what
was
maintained
throughout
this
case
was
a
better
than
one
to
one
ratio,
and
that
that
was
a...
the
minimal
was
above
one
to
one,
and
going
to
one
to
one--
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
--no,
they
would
not
have
been
armed.
officers...
the
marshals,
officers
who
actually
have
physical
custody
and
hand-on
contact
with
the
defendants
are
not
armed,
which
brings
me
to
another
problem--
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
i
would
say
they
could
be
seen.
there's
no
question
that
they
could
be
seen.
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
they
were
on
holsters,
your
honor--
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
--and
they
were
not
concealed
under
jackets.
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
well,
i
think
our
position,
your
honor,
is
in
some
ways
both.
first
of
all,
we
contend
that
in
this
case
there
was
unquestionably
a
need
for
the
presence
of
a
security
force
to
maintain
custody
of
the
defendants.
by
statute,
individuals
who
are
in
custody--
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
--well,
i
would
suggest,
your
honor,
that
the
trial
judge
specifically
found
that
it
was...
that
the
committed
squad
itself,
the
squad
of
state
marshals,
was
inadequate
and
that
the
only
supplement
that
was
available
to
the
committing
squad
was
a
force
of
state
troopers,
and
that
to
that
extent,
from
that
logical
conclusion,
these
state
troopers
were
necessary
in
the
courtroom
to
maintain
custody--
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
--the
special
security
being
that
there
was
a
large
number
of
defendants,
six,
and
that
all
of
them
were
held
without
bail,
and
that
the
available
security,
the
normal,
customary
state
marshals,
were
simply
inadequate
to
both
operate
at
this
trial
and
permit
the
system
of
justice
in
rhode
island
to
go
on--
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
--the
trial
judge
didn't
make
a
specific
finding
as
to
the
need
for
arms,
and
it
was
never
really
specifically
addressed
that
there
was
a
need
for
the
troopers
to
be
armed
in
this
courtroom.
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
i
suppose
that
a
hypothetical
juror
might
draw
such
a
conclusion,
and
to
that
end,
justice
giannini
in
this
case
conducted
an
extensive
voir
dire
of
the
jurors
who
were
available
for
being
empaneled
in
this
trial.
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
during...
the
voir
dire
itself
was
never
transcribed,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
however,
it's
clear
from
justice
giannini's
summarization
of
what
occurred
at
the
voir
dire
that
none
of
the
jurors
who
were
seated
in
the
jury
box
at
the
trial
drew
any
kind
of
inference
at
all
from
the
presence
of
armed
troopers.
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
well,
in
fact,
your
honor,
that's
why
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
for
us
today
to
focus
too
much
on
the
hypothetical
juror
because
we
have
the
voir
dire
in
this
case
i
which
the
jurors
clearly
expressed
no
inference
at
all
from
the
presence
of
armed
troopers,
and
we
have
what
this
jury
actually
did
in
the
end,
which
was
acquit
three
of
the
defendants.
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
well,
your
honor,
i
think
there
are
infinite
possibilities,
of
course--
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
--of
course,
and
as
justice
giannini
concluded
in
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
aspect
of
this
case,
you
can
never
really
draw
any
inferences
from
what
the
jury
does
in
many
cases
because
the
burden
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
is
so
great
that
one
shifting
set
of
circumstances
related
to
one
defendant
may
fall
below
that
burden,
and
in
this
case,
apparently
that
is
what
happened
with
the
jurors.
but
the
point
is
that
when
they
focused
upon
the
three
defendants
that
they
acquitted
in
their
deliberations,
they
certainly
weren't
influenced
by
the
presence
of
the
troopers.
they
acquitted
those
defendants.
so--
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
i
would
say
that
the
ordinary
practice,
your
honor,
is
that
the
marshals...
if
a
defendant
is
not
on
bail...
i'm
sorry,
if
a
defendant
is
on
bail,
we
can
dismiss
that
category
of
cases.
the
marshals
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
defendant
because
he
is
not
in
custody;
they
are
not
charged
with
maintaining
his
custody.
so
in
that
circumstance,
all
you
would
have
is
the
ordinary
courtroom
sheriff
who
handles
papers,
and
certainly
is
unarmed.
in
a
case
where
the
defendant
is
on
bail...
i'm
sorry,
is
held
without
bail,
the
rhode
island
statute
involving
the
department
of
corrections
very
clearly
requires
the
department
of
corrections
to
maintain
custody
of
that
defendant
even
inside
the
courtroom.
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
and
essentially,
your
honor,
it's
not
really
a
judicial
function
at
the
beginning,
it's
an
executive
function.
the
department
of
corrections
is
an
arm
of
the
executive,
and
these
defendants
would
be
in
their
custody.
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
well,
that
would...
that
would
certainly
be
true
in
a
case
where
the
defendant
raises
the
question
and
asks
the
trial
judge
to
make
a
decision.
as
i
understood
justice
rehnquist's
question,
it
was
a
first
line
who's
in
charge
of
security,
and
the
first
line
is
unquestionably
the
executive
authorities.
then--
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
--found
that
it
was
the
decision
of
the...
the
responsibility
of
the
judge,
your
honor?
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
no,
that
hasn't
been
found
erroneous.
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
yes.
and--
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
--well,
i
think
the
first
circuit
did
dispute
that
conclusion
by
district
judge
selya.
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
i
don't
think
that
the
court
specifically
used
the
terms
"clearly
erroneous",
your
honor.
what
the
court
did
was
it
concluded
that
the
findings
within
the
rhode
island
state
court
system
had
involved
the
presence
of
the
troopers
and
their
necessity
to
complement
the
state
marshals
and
had
not
focused
specifically
on
the
defendants
and
their
characteristics.
and
the
first
circuit
concluded
from
that
that
that
failure
was
constitutionally
erroneous,
that
the
focus
of
the
state
trial
judge
should
have
been
on
the
defendants
and
their
particular
characteristics,
not
on
the
need
to
maintain
an
ordinary
ratio
of
security
personnel
to
defendants.
but
i
would
point
out
that
even
the
absence
of
the
specific
findings
by
the
trial
judge
in
state
superior
court
in
this
case
focusing
on
the
specific
defendants
and
their
characteristics,
even
the
absence
of
those
findings,
i
would
suggest,
is
not
fatal
to
the
conclusion
that
the
trial
judge
reached,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
there
are
specific
facts
that
are
clear
from
this
record
with
regard
to
these
defendants,
factors
which
the
first
circuit
suggested
from
the
american
bar
association
guidelines,
that
ought
to
be
considered
by
a
trial
judge
in
deciding
on
security
issues.
one
factor
is
that
this
particular
defendant,
mr.
flynn,
had
a
prior
record
of
escape,
and
that
is
clear
from
the
record
of
this
trial.
another
factor
that
the
american
bar
association
standards
suggest
is
that
accomplices
of
the
individuals
on
trial
were
at
large
during
this
trial,
which
in
and
of
itself,
according
to
the
american
bar
association
comments,
creates
a
possibility
of
some
need
for
security.
also
relevant
factors
that
i
would
submit
were
well
known
to
the
trial
judge
are
the
fact
that
two
of
the
state's
witnesses
were
in
the
protection
program,
so
that
the
issues
before
the
trial
judge
in
considering
whether
or
not
to
permit
the
troopers
to
remain
were
very
clearly
weighed
in
favor
of
permitting
them
to
remain,
and
in
fact,
he
then
conducted
an
extensive
voir
dire,
a
voir
dire
which
concluded
with
factual
findings
on
his
part--
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
--that
is
correct,
your
honor,
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
might
point
out
that
he
promised
the
defendants
that
should
they
wish
to
exclude
any
of
these
jurors
because
of
anything
they
said,
that
he
would
certainly
exclude
them
for
cause,
and
it
is
very
clear
that
at
the
close
of
the
jury
selection,
the
defendants
were
satisfied
with
the
jury
that
they
had.
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
well,
i
think
that--
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
--i
suppose
that
we
could
say
that
it's
both,
your
honor,
and
if
it's
against
the
uniform,
i
think
that
flynn
has
a
real
problem
because
he
was
apparently
willing
to
concede
throughout
the
trial
that
the
state
marshals
would
be
fine,
the
normal
state
marshals,
and
they
wear
uniforms,
and
their
uniforms,
i
would
submit,
are
no
more
obtrusive
or
obnoxious,
if
you
will,
to
a
defendant's
presumption
of
innocence,
than
the
uniform
worn
by
the
rhode
island
state
troopers.
so
i
suppose
that
he
may
wish
to
focus
more
narrowly
on
the
weapons.
in
any
event,
it's
our
position
that
whatever
this
court
concludes
with
regards
to
the
proceedings
that
justice
giannini
conducted,
we
would
argue
that
the
trial
judge's
proceedings
were
proper,
and
that
he
properly
concluded
that
this
type
of
security
force
was
necessary,
that
he
engaged
in
the
proper
balance
under
estelle
v.
williams,
and
concluded
that
the
jury
would
not
be
influenced
by
this.
whatever
this
court
thinks
of
justice
giannini's
conclusion
on
that
aspect,
we
would,
we
would
certainly
argue
that
this
case
is
still
not
a
ripe
case
or
a
proper
case
for
a
grant
of
a
write
of
habeas
corpus.
first
of
all,
the
issue
before
the
court
is
really
whether
or
not
the
defendant
was
deprived
of
a
fair
trial,
and
in
making
that
determination,
a
reviewing
court
has
to
consider
both
the
evidence
and
other
circumstances
at
the
trial
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
trial
was
constitutionally
unfair.
and
i
would
simply
point
to
several
aspects
of
this
trial
that
weigh
heavily
in
favor
of
our
claim
that
the
defendant
was
not
deprived
of
a
fair
trial.
there
were
testimony
by
accomplices
who
participated
in
the
preparation
for
this
crime
which
the
accomplices
said
that
the
meetings
occurred
at
flynn's
particular
house.
there
was
an
identification
both
by
the
accomplices
and
by
an
impartial
witness
whose
identification
was
deemed
to
be
proper
and
admissible
by
every
judge
who
has
reviewed
this
case,
including
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals.
there
was
evidence
that
flynn
and
other
of
his
co-defendants
went
to
las
vegas
to
track
down
one
of
the
witnesses
who
turned
state's
evidence,
witness
dussault,
that
they
went
there
in
an
attempt
to
persuade
him
that
he
should
remain
part
of
the
team.
there
was
other
physical
evidence.
there
was--
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
--certainly
that
evidence,
your
honor,
particularly
with
regard
to
dussault
was
not
offered
against
the
defendants
who
were
acquitted.
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
no,
the--
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
--the
best
identification
evidence,
the
impartial
witness
identification
evidence,
was
against
flynn,
your
honor,
and
i
would
argue
that--
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
--only
in
my
recollection
of
the
record
from
the
accomplice
witnesses
who
were
certainly
more
familiar--
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
--well,
i
think
that,
i
would
say,
your
honor,
is
a
jury
question,
and
the
jury
seems
to
have
accepted
part
of
their
testimony
and
apparently
rejected
part
of
their
testimony.
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
well,
i
think
we
should
certainly
accept
what
the
jury
accepted,
your
honor,
which
is
the
evidence
against
flynn
and
the
three
defendants
that
it
convicted.
i
would
also
point
out
there
was
more
physical
evidence
against
flynn.
there
was
a
briefcase
that
flynn
had
been
seen
with
at
the
robbery
scene
that
turned
up
at
flynn's
house
subsequent
to
the
robbery.
flynn
himself
on
the
evening
of
the
robbery
was
observed
by
witnesses
to
be
flashing
large
amounts
of
cash.
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
well--
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
--that's
true,
your
honor.
we
don't
specifically
know--
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
--there
were
marshals
in
the
courtroom--
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
--but
the
troopers
were
supplementing
the
marshals.
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
but
i
would
suggest
that
the
record
itself
in
this
case
doesn't
reflect
because
the
defendants
never,
on
a
day
to
day
basis,
didn't
put
on
the
record
how
many
troopers
were
present
and
how
many
marshals
and
where
exactly
they
were,
but
i
don't
think
the
defendants
would
contend
that
there
were
more
than
four
troopers
present
in
the
courtroom.
i
don't--
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
--oh,
there
certainly
were.
there
were...
there
were
marshals
there,
perhaps
as
many
as
four
in
addition
to
the
troopers.
but
the
reason
why
we
asked
for
a
remand,
your
honor,
is
that
as
we
read
the
habeas
jurisprudence
of
this
court,
a
court
of
appeals
on
a
fair
trial
issue
can't
grant
a
new
trial
without
considering
whether
or
not
the
defendant
was
denied
a
fair
trial.
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
well,
we
certainly
want
it
reversed,
but
i'm
answering
justice
stevens'
question
with
regard--
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
--to
a
subsequent
hearing.
and
based
upon
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
that
i
have
cited
to
your
honors
today,
i
think
clearly
the
first
circuit's
decision
ought
to
be
reversed.
but--
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
--absolutely
without
the
necessity
for
a
new
hearing,
but
short
of
that,
your
honor--
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
--were
this
court
to
conclude
that
the
first
circuit
had
some
points
with
regard
to
the
manner
in
which
the
trial
judge
had
conducted
the
pretrial
hearing,
it
is
certainly
flynn's
burden
a
a
habeas
petitioner
to
put
before
the
federal
court
facts
that
will
support
his
claim
for
a
new
trial,
and
it
is
our
view
that
he
failed
to
do
that
by
failing
to
put
in
any
evidence
in
the
lower
court.
but
based
upon
all
these
factors,
it's
the
state's
position
that
justice
giannini
reasonably
concluded
in
the
superior
court
level
that
the
troopers
were
necessary
to
maintain
proper
order
and
custody
of
the
defendants,
and
that
even
if
he
was
wrong
in
that,
even
if
this
court
were
to
conclude
he
was
wrong,
that
the
defendant
was
not
denied
his
constitutional
right
to
a
fair
trial,
there
was
strong
evidence
against
this
defendant,
strong
evidence
that
the
jury
properly
gave
credence
to
the
presumption
of
innocence
because
it
acquitted
three
co-defendants,
and
strong
evidence
and
a
factual
finding
by
justice
giannini
that
the
jurors
had
expressed
no
bias
or
prejudice
relative
to
the
presence
of
the
troopers,
and
for
this
reason,
the
state
submits
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
and
unless
there
are
any
questions,
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
thank
you.
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
yes,
ore
or
two
points,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
may.
with
regard
to
the
issue
of
bail,
it's
very
clear
that
under
rhode
island
law
at
the
time
this
case
was
tried,
a
pretrial
detainee
could
be
held
without
bail
only
upon
a
showing
that
he
had
a
propensity
to
flee.
i
have
cited
at
pages
9
and
10
of
my
brief,
in
footnote
3,
the
case
of
lemme
v.
langlois
in
which
the
rhode
island
supreme
court
held
that
a
subsidiary
finding
to
holding
without
bail
is
a
danger
that
the
individual
may
seek
to
flee,
so
that
that,
i
think,
is
part
of
the
record
in
this
case.
the
initial
judge
must
have
made
that
conclusion
with
regard
to
all
of
the
defendants
in
this
case,
that
they
had
that
propensity.
with
regard
to
mr.
justice
marshall's
questions
regarding
the
difference
between
guns
and
uniforms,
i
would
refer
to
pages
23
and
24
of
our
brief
in
which
we
discuss
the
concession
by
flynn's
trial
counsel
that
he
would
have
been
happy
if
these
troopers
had
been
moved
somewhere
else
and
done
some
other
kind
of
duty,
and
if
state
marshals
had
been
brought
in
to
replace
them.
so
i
would
submit
that
that
clearly
indicates
that
he
would
have
been
happy
with
marshals,
and
he's
not...
he's
not
complaining
about--
mr.
thomas
more
dickinson
--uniformed,
uniformed
marshals,
certainly,
your
honor.
and
with
regard
to
hats,
just
finally,
there's
nothing
on
this
record
to
suggest
that
these
troopers
wore
hats
in
the
courtroom,
and
i
would
suggest
that
they
did
not.
unless
the
court
has
any
other
questions,
i
would
rest
on
my
brief.
