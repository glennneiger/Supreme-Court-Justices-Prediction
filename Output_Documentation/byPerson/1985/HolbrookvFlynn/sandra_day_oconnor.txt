justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
dickinson,
there
was
a
state
appellate
court
review
of
the
trial
court's
rulings,
in
effect,
wasn't
there?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
there...
yes,
well,
there
was.
you
acknowledge
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
did
the
state
appellate
court
ever
think
that
the
trial
judge
had
considered
that
there
was
anything
about
these
defendants
or
this
trial
that
required
extra
security?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
seemed
to
focus
on
the
manpower
shortages
and
the
obligations
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
dickinson,
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
presence
of
armed
security
guards
in
the
courtroom,
no
matter
how
many
there
might
have
been,
simply
doesn't
impair
or
burden
the
presumption
of
innocence,
or
do
you
take
the
position
that
there
was
a
special
need
in
this
case
for
the
security
measures
that
were
in
fact
taken?
i'm
not
clear
what
your
position
is.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
except
that
there
was
no
such
finding
by
the
trial
court
or
the
state
appellate
court.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
want
us
to
assume
that
there
was
a
finding
that
there
was
a
need
for
special
security
here,
is
that
the
position?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
don't
you
think
the
trial
judge
is
in
the
best
position
certainly
to
judge
the
prejudicial
impact,
if
any,
on
the
jurors?
