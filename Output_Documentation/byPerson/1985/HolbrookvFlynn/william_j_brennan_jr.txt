brennan,
jr.
are
you
going
to
tell
us
exactly
where
the
officers
were
in
relation
to
the
defendants
in
the
courtroom?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
were
they
behind
the
chairs
in
which
defendants
were
sitting
or
where?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as,
for
example,
we
have
a
counsel
side
here
and
a...
beyond
it,
a
spectator
section.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
the
way
it
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
each
have
his
own
counsel?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
dickinson,
had
there
been
a
dozen
marshals,
uniformed
differently,
i
gather,
from
the
state
troopers,
would
they
also
have
been
armed?
no.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
just
ask
while
i
have
you
interrupted--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--are
the...
were
the
arms
holstered
at
the
state
troopers'
sides,
or
could
they
be
seen,
their
weapons?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
could
be.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
that
was
after
the
objection
was
made
to
the
presence
of
the
troopers?
