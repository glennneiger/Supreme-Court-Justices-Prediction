justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
was
the
need
for
arms?
why
were
they
armed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
take,
take
this
hypothetical.
juror
a,
who
has
been
to
three
trials
and
in
every
trial
the
people
there
with
the
defendants
were
unarmed,
and
then
he's
at
this
one
where
they
are
armed,
could
he
draw
a
conclusion
from
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he
ask
them
would
they
be
influenced
by
a
gun?
justice
thurgood
marshall
about
how
many
reasons
can
you
conceive
that
a
juror
would
acquit
one
man
and
hold
another
man
guilty,
about
how
many
different
reasons
would
you--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--close
to
a
million,
wouldn't
it
be?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
know
why
they
whether
we've
breached
it,
but
is
the
objection
against
the
uniform
or
the
gun?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
both?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
wouldn't
have
complained?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
this...
i
still
can't
understand,
if
these
men
had
been
unarmed
it
would
have
been
all
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what's
so
impressive
about
a
state
trooper
uniform?
weren't
they
just
here
in
the
courtroom?
