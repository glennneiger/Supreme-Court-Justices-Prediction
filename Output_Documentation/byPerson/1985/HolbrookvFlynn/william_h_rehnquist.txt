were
they
held
with...
when
you
use
the
term
were
held
without
bail,
do
you
mean
they
were
unable
to
raise
money
bail
or
that
the
trial
court
would
not
allow
them
to
be
free
even
if
they
had
raised
money
bail?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
dickinson.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
want
to
find
out,
if
i
can,
if
it
is
in
the
record,
how
the
system
of
furnishing
security
at
rhode
island
trials
works.
is
it
ordinarily
the
judge
who
decides
what
sort
of
security
particular
defendants
should
be
furnished,
or
is
it
the
marshals
service?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that's
a...
the
custody
decision,
how
it
shall
be
maintained,
is
initially
made
by,
not
by
the
court,
i
take
it,
but
by
the
department
of
corrections.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
excuse
me--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
was
the
basis
for
the
first
judge's
denial
of
bail?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
for
purposes
of
the
trial,
these
people
were
held
without
bail.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
ask
you
one
other
question.
you
say
that
you
are
not
asking
the
federal
courts
to
decide
on
the
deployment
of
security
people,
but
because
the
supreme
court
of
rhode
island
said
this
was
an
extraordinary
situation,
that
in
effect,
i
guess
in
your
view,
somehow
has
a
bearing
on
the
federal
constitutional
question.
why
is
that,
because
the
state
supreme
court
didn't
seem
to
rely
on
any
federal
constitutional
grounds.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
in
an
identical
case
coming
perhaps
from
massachusetts
where
the
supreme
judicial
court
had
not
intervened,
the
case
would
go
differently.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
you
know,
the
american
bar
association
doesn't
write
the
constitution.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
why
should
any
court
just
whose
sole
power
comes
from
the
federal
constitution,
tell
a
state
you
have
to
follow
the
aba?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
the
supreme
court
of
rhode
island
refused
to
reverse
these
convictions.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
it
didn't
say,
it
didn't
find
them
sufficiently
extraordinary
to
reverse
the
conviction.
