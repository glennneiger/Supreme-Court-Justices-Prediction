chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
batson
against
kentucky.
mr.
niehaus,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
speaking
now
of
a
petit
jury,
the
trial
jury,
or
the
grand
jury,
the
array?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
must.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
a
practical
matter,
how
does
the
judge
go
about
this?
must
he
have
a
census
of
the
jurisdiction
before
him,
or
is
it
the
whole
state,
or
the
immediate
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
the
district?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
asking
how
you
would
ask
the
judge
to
go
about
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
asking
him
to
take
judicial
notice
of
the
composition
of
the
state
or
the
county
or
the
district
so
that
he
knows?
how
is
he
going
to
make
the
judgment
about
the
jury
itself
if
he
doesn't
know
the
composition
of
the
whole
community?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
difference
in
the
end
result
if
they,
to
take
your
term,
disappear
or
they
are
cone
from
the
jury
on
challenges
for
cause
than
for
peremptories?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
then
your
end
result
might
not
be
representative.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
you
give
the
judge
a
chance
to
correct
this?
when
the
jury
is...
the
selection
is
completed,
but
before
the
jury
is
sworn
in,
would
you
for
the
defendant
be
required
to
move
that
the
whole
panel
be
excused
and
that
you
start
all
over
because
it
is
not
representative,
and
if
so,
what
evidence
would
you
put
in
on
a
motion
of
that
kind?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don't
think
there
is
any
requirement
that
the
number
of
peremptory
challenges
be
the
same
for
both?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
most
states
they
are
not.
isn't
that
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
pearson.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
his
answer
was,
i
struck
them
because
i
always
strike
them
in
every
case
i
try?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it
was
a
system
prevailing
at
the
time,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
were
you
about
to
say
that
swain
provides?
what
was
the
point
you
were
going
to
make?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
mentioned
or
referred
to
the
difficulty
of
trying
to
find
out
what
the
pattern
or
practice
is,
but
suppose
there
is
a
manual
in
the
prosecutor's
office
and
the
section
on
selection
of
juries
says
categorically
that
you
should
always
strike
any
minority
representative
from
the
panel
with
a
peremptory
challenge
if
the
defendant
is
a
member
of
some
minority,
whether
catholic
or
jewish
or
puerto
rican
or
whatever.
what
about
that?
would
you
need
to
show
a
pattern
of
practice
if
the
manual
instructs
the
prosecutors
to
do
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
instruction?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
you
would
need
to
show
that
there
was
at
least
some
compliance
with
that
manual.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
wallace.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
wallace.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
