mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
theme
of
the
brief
we
have
filed
in
this
case
is
that
far
from
standing
as
an
aberration
in
the
law,
swain
against
alabama
fits
into
a
consistent
pattern
with
all
of
this
court's
related
jurisprudence.
swain
was
an
equal
protection
case,
but
surely
the
opinion's
careful
analysis
of
the
historic
role
and
purposes
of
the
peremptory
challenge
system
is
even
more
directly
relevant
to
the
meaning
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
trial
by
an
impartial
jury.
the
court
in
swain
suggested
that
the
peremptory
challenge
at
least
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
may
well
be
a
necessary
part
of
that
right,
although
it
also
said
that
the
court
had
previously
said
the
constitution
doesn't
require
it,
but
certainly
the
implications
of
the
analysis
in
swain
is
that
the
peremptory
challenge
system
as
we
have
known
it
is
consistent
with
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
trial
by
impartial
jury.
some
of
the
briefs
filed
in
this
case
suggest
that
history
more
firmly
supports
the
right
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
than
on
the
part
of
the
prosecution,
but
even
if
that
is
true,
that
does
not
in
any
way
undermine
the
constitutionality
of
statute
law
or
rules
of
courts
such
as
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
which
allow
the
use
of
the
peremptory
by
the
prosecution
as
well
as
a
counterbalance
to
its
use
by
the
defendant
so
that
the
objective
of
the
sixth
amendment,
trial
by
an
impartial
jury,
is
more
effectively
achieved
by
lopping
off
from
the
panel
those
who
in
the
judgment
of
the
litigants
are
somewhat
less
likely
in
their
own
speculative
judgment
to
decide
the
case
impartially
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
in
the
context
of
the
particular
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
oh,
yes.
we
think
that
swain
quite
properly
recognized
that
the
equal
protection
clause
protects
against
systematic
discrimination
in
the
system
that
prejudices
participation
in
the
system
but
does
not
guarantee
a
particular
defendant
any
particular
constitution
on
his
own
jury
so
long
as
that
jury
is
impartial.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
because
of
their
race
in
the
context
of
the
case.
what
the
prosecutor
is
supposed
to
be
doing,
and
i
think
swain
makes
this
quite
clear,
is
making
a
litigation
judgment
about
how
best
to
assure
impartiality
of
a
jury
in
the
context
of
a
particular
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
would
not.
it
would
allow
the
use
of
that
conviction
as
a
remedy
for
a
systematic
discrimination,
although
in
one
sense
the
particular
defendant
in
the
particular
case
wasn't
discriminated
against
if
he
had
an
impartial
jury.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
correct.
and
when
there
is
something
shown
that
is
infecting
the
system,
that
case
is
allowed
to
be
used
as
a
device
for
correcting
that
infects
the
system.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
probably
would
be
in
that
case,
your
honor,
although--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it
is
an
inartful
answer
at
best.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
swain
says
it
is.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
take
the
position
that
that
is
a
permissible
basis
for
exercising
peremptory
challenges.
it
is
not--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--oh,
no,
no.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
is
much
virtue
in
the
present
system
in
the
fact
that
judges
are
not
asked
to
say
aye
or
nay
to
the
various
reasons
that
counsel
have
as
litigation
decisions
about
why
they
want
to
exercise
their
peremptories
they
way
they
do.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
because
that
is
a
matter
of
litigation
strategy
in
the
particular
case.
the
judge
is
not
supposed
to
intrude
into
litigation
decisions
of
that
kind
as
long
as
he
feels
that
the
jury
that
is
being
impaneled
is
an
impartial
one
that
meets
the
requirements
of
the
sixth
amendment.
the
very
nature
of
the
peremptory
challenge
is
that
probably
in
most
cases,
probably
the
great
majority,
it
tends
to
reduce
or
eliminate
the
representation
of
certain
parts
of
the
cross-section
of
the
community
from
the
particular
jury.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
it
is
put
that
way
rather
than
related
to
an
affinity
between
these
jurors
and
the
particular
defendant
or
the
particular
kind
of
crime
it
is
about.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
experience
of
federal
prosecutors
is
that
they
don't
think
in
such
broad
brush
stereotypes
for
the
most
part
because
there
are
many
other--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--and
i
agree
with
you.
that
is
just
entirely
too
undiscriminating.
swain
has
served
as
a
catalyst
to
make
people
look
beyond
stereotypes
of
that
kind.
for
one
thing,
subsequent
decisions
have
assured
that
the
venires
themselves
are
more
broadly
constituted,
and
in
the
20
years
since
swain,
the
profile
of
many
things
has
changed.
prosecutors
today
are
much
more
predominantly
persons
who
in
their
own
personal
experiences
have
looked
beyond
stereotypes
with
various
racial
groups.
they
have
gone
to
school
with
people
of
various
groups,
worked
with
them.
a
large
percentage
of
prosecutors
today
in
the
u.s.
attorneys'
offices
are
minority
or
women.
for
example,
there
is
increased
diversity,
as
we
stated
in
our
brief,
in
both
income
levels
and
education
levels
in
the
black
community
and
in
other
communities,
but
the
nature
of
the
peremptory
challenge
system
is
that
the
kind
of
case
that
is
involved
tends
to
influence
the
judgment
of
both
litigants
with
respect
to
who
is
apt
to
be
a
better
risk
to
be
impartial
in
the
case.
obviously,
in
an
immigration
case,
the
prosecutor
is
more
likely
to
strike
members
of
certain
ethnic
groups
in
that
particular
kind
of
a
case.
if
a
white
policeman
is
a
defendant,
he
may
be
concerned
about
relations
between
the
police
and
the
black
community.
