justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
court
could
have,
without
regard
to
swain,
could
have
proceeded
under
state
law
to
regulate.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
saying
the
sixth
amendment
right
requires
that
the
actual
petit
jury
that
tries
the
case
must
be
representative,
or
have
our
cases
talked
about
the
panel?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
suppose
until
peremptory
challenges
are
just
out
entirely,
you
would
have
to
just
be
talking
about
the
panel,
because
even
if
you
win
this
case,
there
are
going
to
be
a
lot
of
peremptory
challenges
exercised
for
other
reasons
that
might
well
eliminate
identifiable
groups
in
the
community.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
just
should
go
back.
swain
dealt
with
just
a
specific
jury,
but
not
in
terms
of
the
sixth
amendment.
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
can
a
prosecutor
answer
your...
if
you
adopt
a
california
rule
or
massachusetts,
how
does
a
prosecutor
answer
your
doctrine
of
chances?
what
can
he
say
that
would
permit
him
to
strike
three
out
of
six
blacks?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
wouldn't
turn
it
into
a
challenge
for
cause?
justice
byron
r.
white
like
this
black
is
too
well
educated,
or
he
works
for
the
wrong
company,
or
something
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
black
defendant
striking
white
jurors?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
could
say,
well,
the
history
of
the
death
penalty
in
this
community
is
such
that
there
is
prejudice
against
blacks,
there
is
prejudice
against
blacks
especially
if
they
kill
a
white,
and
so
i
think
that
whites...
there
is
a
reasonable
possibility
that
whites
on
this
jury
will
be
prejudiced
against
this
defendant,
and
that
is
why...
so
i
am
going
to
strike
all
the
whites
i
can
strictly
on
a
racial
basis,
assuming
that...
not
assuming,
but
i
think
that
they
will
be
prejudiced
against
my
clients.
now,
what
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
nevertheless,
as
you
answered
justice
brennan
a
while
ago,
you
think
it
is
the
reason
that
is
bad,
the
reason
for
striking,
so
that
would
be
a
racial
reason
for
striking
a
white.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say,
but
that
is
permissible.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
what
i
asked
you.
would
that
be
constitutionally
permissible,
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
that
be
constitutionally
permissible,
to
strike
the
whites
because
of
the--
--what
would
be
the
constitutional
basis
for
the
claim
that
it
was
not
permissible?
what
restricts
a
defendant
from
striking
anybody
once,
or
saying
i
don't
like
blacks,
or
i
don't
like
jews,
or
whatever
he
wants
to
say?
there
is
no
state
action
involved
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
peremptories
by
the
defense
are
constitutionally
required?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
you
have.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
prosecution
is
strictly
statutory.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
by
practice.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
many
of
them
are
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
california--
justice
byron
r.
white
there
are
five
blacks,
six
blacks,
and
the
prosecutor
strikes
these
five
of
them
on
the
jury,
and
he
doesn't
strike
the
other
one,
or
he
does,
he
strikes
the
one,
and
why
did
you
strike
him,
as
justice
stevens
asked
you?
he
says,
just
because
he
is
black.
i
don't
know
anything
about
him.
i
just
think
blacks
will
vote
for
innocence
here
generally
unless
i
know
something
about
him.
i
know
something
about
these
other
five,
so
i
have
left
them
on.
why
wouldn't
that
be
constitutional?
he
concedes
that
he
is
striking
because
of
a
stereotyped
view
of
the
way
blacks
behave.
justice
byron
r.
white
with
a
cross
section.
justice
byron
r.
white
counsel,
what
do
you
think...
under
swain,
what
if
it
is
proved
that
over
a
period
of
time,
whatever
that
is,
the
prosecutor
just
strikes
all
blacks?
doesn't
that
just
raise
an
inference
that
he
is
doing
it
for
racial
reasons?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
he
thinks
that
just
all
blacks...
there
isn't
any
black
that
is
qualified
to
sit
on
a
jury.
that
is
the
inference,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
if
the...
do
you
think
under
swain
that
if
that
is
proved,
that
the
conviction
would
be
set
aside?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
striking
people
because
of
their
racial
characteristics,
if
that
is
a
justifiable
inference
in
the
case,
the
judgment
is
going
to
be
set
aside,
isn't
it,
under
swain?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
what
if
the
prosecutor
gets
up
and
says,
now,
look,
we
don't
have
to
wait
for
a
period
of
time
to
rely
on
some
inference
from
statistics.
i
am
striking
these
blacks
because
i
don't
think
they
can
sit
fairly
in
this
case
or
any
other
case.
now,
swain
didn't
approve
that,
did
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
did?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
makes
you
think
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
it
says
that
if
you
show
that
these
strikes
have
taken
place
over
a
period
of
time,
there
is
an
inference
of
racial
discrimination.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
there
is
another
way
of
proving
racial
discrimination?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
just
suggested
to
you,
and
my
example
is
clear
as
a
bell,
the
prosecutor
can
seize
it.
don't
wait
for
a
couple
more
years.
i
will
tell
you
now
what
the
result
will
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
counsel,
a
token
black
left
on
a
jury
isn't
going
to
satisfy
the
theory
of
the
other
side,
their
statistical
approach,
as
the
exchange
with
justice
brennan
indicated.
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
wallace,
wasn't
swain
just
a
case
that
says
what
it
takes
to
make
out
a
prime
facie
case
of
racial
discrimination?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
over
a
period
of
time
if
you
could
prove
that
the
prosecutor
struck
blacks
because
of
their
race,
and
there
never
could
be
a
black,
as
far
as
he
was
concerned,
who
could
sit,
that
makes
out
a
prima
facie
case.
now,
if
he
gets
up
and
says,
that
is
the
way
i
do
it
in
this
case
and
every
other,
i
don't
know
why
swain
would
prevent
overturning
that
conviction.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
that
has
always
been
true
of
racial--
justice
byron
r.
white
--discrimination
on
petit
juries,
panels.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
wallace,
don't
you
think
saying
that
i
think
there
isn't
any
black
who
wouldn't
be
more
likely
to
acquit,
all
blacks
are
more
likely
to
acquit,
so
i
am
going
to
keep
them
all
off
the
jury,
is
that
really
very
much
different
from
saying
i
am
striking
this
man
because
he
is
a
black?
that
is
just
another
way
of
saying
the
same
thing,
is
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
all
right,
i
say
these
black
jurors
are
more
likely
to
acquit
black
defendants,
and
therefore...
i
am
not
sure
that
that
is
even
very
sound.
justice
byron
r.
white
under
swain,
say
that
over
a
period
of
time
the
prosecutor
is
proved
to
have
struck
all
blacks
off
the
juries,
and
the
reason
he
constantly
gives
is
blacks
just
won't
acquit...
they
are
just
more
prone
to
acquit.
that
is
just
the
way
they
are.
now,
i
thought
swain
said
that
would
probably
make
out
a--
