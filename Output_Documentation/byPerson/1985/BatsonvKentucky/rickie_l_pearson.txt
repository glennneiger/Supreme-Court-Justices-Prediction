mr.
rickie
l.
pearson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
issue
before
this
court
today
is
simply
whether
swain
versus
alabama
should
be
reaffirmed.
we
believe
that
swain--
mr.
rickie
l.
pearson
--we
believe
that
it
is
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
is
the
item
that
should
be
challenged,
and
presents
perhaps
an
address
to
the
problem.
swain
dealt
primarily
with
the
use
of
peremptory
challenges
to
strike
individuals
who
were
of
a
cognizable
or
identifiable
group.
petitioners
show
no
case
other
than
the
state
of
california's
case
dealing
with
the
use
of
peremptories
wherein
the
sixth
amendment
was
cited
as
authority
for
resolving
the
problem.
so,
we
believe
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
indeed
the
issue.
that
was
the
guts
and
primarily
the
basic
concern
of
swain.
we
believe
that
it
provides
an
objective
approach
to
the
problem.
it
is
bright
line
with
principles
of
law,
sound
constitutional
reasoning
based
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
not
the
sixth
amendment.
in
the
trial
court
under
swain
petitioner
had
the
burden
of
proving
that
his
fourteenth
amendment
rights
were
violated,
and
he
failed
to
prove
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
only
made
an
attempt
to
get
the
prosecutor
to
acknowledge
that
the
prosecutor
had
struck
four
blacks
and
two
whites
by
utilizing
peremptory
challenges.
he
never
asked
the
prosecutor
when,
where,
and
under
what
circumstances
he
had
struck
blacks
in
the
past.
mr.
rickie
l.
pearson
that
would
not
be
constitutionally
impermissible
because
under
swain
the
petitioner
would
have
had
to
show
that
the
particular
prosecutor
had
struck
blacks
over
a
period
of
time.
mr.
rickie
l.
pearson
no,
sir,
i
would
not
concede
that
that
would
have
been
a
constitutional
violation.
mr.
rickie
l.
pearson
i
think
under
swain
that
would
have
been
permissible,
because
here
we
are
talking
about
over
a
period
of
time,
not
in
a
particular
case,
and
we
have
to
realize
that
there
are
assorted
reasons
for
exercising
peremptory
challenges.
so
much
might
include
that
very
attitude,
or
it
could
have
struck
blacks
because
they
were
inattentive,
or
one
of
the
venire
persons
might
have
been
too
talkative.
there
could
be
a
host
of
reasons.
but
the
problem
with
requiring
an
explanation
is
that
it
requires
a
subjective
answer.
mr.
rickie
l.
pearson
justice
marshall,
no
one
knows.
i
don't
know
how
long
he
would
have
to
be,
but
over
a
period
of
time.
i
think
you
would
have
to
look
at--
mr.
rickie
l.
pearson
--this
court
has
never
stated,
and
i
dare
not
speak
for
the
court.
mr.
rickie
l.
pearson
absolutely.
yes,
sir.
mr.
rickie
l.
pearson
it
says
over
a
period
of
time,
but
it
does
not
state
what
the
period
of
time
is.
that
is
what
swain
says.
petitioner
has
proposed
two
remedies.
first,
that
peremptory
challenges
be
totally
eliminated
for
the
prosecution.
and
in
his
brief
he
also
states
the
wheeler
approach,
which
is
that
when
the
prosecution
exercises
peremptory
challenges
to
strike
all
or
most
of
a
cognizable
or
identifiable
group,
that
the
prosecutor
be
required
to
explain
the
use
of
those
challenges.
as
to
the
eliminination
of
challenges
totally
for
the
prosecution,
we
believe
that
it
would
create
an
imbalance
in
the
selection
process
for
juries.
on
one
hand,
the
defendant
is
free
or
should
be
free
from
bias.
and
on
the
other
hand,
so
should
the
prosecution.
if
on
one
hand
the
prosecution
can
only
voir
dire
and
exercise
challenges
for
cause,
the
system
is
imbalanced.
furthermore,
i
think
that
in
the
event
peremptory
challenges
are
totally
eliminated
for
the
prosecution,
we
are
on
the
tread
and
may
be
moving
more
toward
the
choosing
of
a
jury
of
a
particular
composition
that
the
petitioner
or
defendant
below--
mr.
rickie
l.
pearson
--well,
justice
marshall,
in
that
case
you
might
well
move
more
toward
a
more
balanced
system,
but
when
you
propose
the
total
elimination
of
peremptory
challenges
for
the
prosecution,
you
move
more
toward
an
imbalance.
mr.
rickie
l.
pearson
yes,
sir,
i
understand.
when
you
said--
mr.
rickie
l.
pearson
--if
i
understand
your
question--
mr.
rickie
l.
pearson
--if
both
sides
could
exercise
peremptory
challenges?
mr.
rickie
l.
pearson
no,
sir,
it
would
not
violate
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
of
america.
mr.
rickie
l.
pearson
that
would
be
all
right.
yes,
sir.
because
there
is
no
origin
of
peremptory
challenges
in
the
constitution.
of
course,
there
are
some
historical
notions
for
their
existence.
mr.
rickie
l.
pearson
it
was,
based
on...
even
in
colonial
times
and...
to
some
extent
and
based
on
the
common
law.
but
if
there
were
to
be
an
eradication
of
peremptory
challenge
for
both
sides,
there
would
be
no
constitutional
violation.
both
would
stand
equal
before
the
eyes
of
the
law.
we
also
believe
that
if
peremptory
challenges
are
eliminated
totally
for
the
prosecution,
you
are
going
to
undermine
the
unanimous
verdict
concept
which
kentucky
is
a
unanimous
verdict
jurisdiction,
because
it
is
doing
to
push
the
selection
of
the
jury
toward
a
particular
composition.
petitioner
has
also
proposed
that
the
prosecution
be
required
to
explain
the
use
of
peremptory
challenges
under
prescribed
circumstances.
first
of
all,
we
would
state
that
that
is
not
required
by
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
surely
we
don't
believe
that
is
required
by
the
sixth
amendment,
nor
is
it
required
by
the
state
constitution
of
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
nor
its
criminal
rules
of
procedure.
to
require
an
explanation
of
peremptory
challenges
would
destroy,
we
believe,
the
historical
nature
and
function
of
the
device
itself.
mr.
rickie
l.
pearson
if
i
understand,
that's
correct.
absolutely.
and
that
is
consistent
with
this
historical
development.
it
has
always
been
unfettered
and
uncontrolled
by
the
court,
unexplained,
and
that
is
the
very
nature
of
the
device
itself.
mr.
rickie
l.
pearson
yes.
mr.
rickie
l.
pearson
no,
sir,
i--
mr.
rickie
l.
pearson
--if
the
state
does
it
over
a
period
of
time,
yes,
it
does,
but
in
a
particular
case--
mr.
rickie
l.
pearson
--but
in
a
particular
case--
mr.
rickie
l.
pearson
--we
don't
believe
so.
mr.
rickie
l.
pearson
well,
i
think
there
based
upon
how
many
times
it
has
been
done,
it
has
to
raise
a
reasonable
inference
that
he
is
practicing
invidious
discrimination.
i
can't
quantify
a
particular
number.
mr.
rickie
l.
pearson
as
i
understand
your
question,
i
don't
know
of
a
case
to
that
point,
but
i
do
know
that
swain
says
that--
mr.
rickie
l.
pearson
--pardon?
mr.
rickie
l.
pearson
no,
sir,
not
as
you
put
it.
i
will
say--
mr.
rickie
l.
pearson
--i
was
going
to
say
that
swain
provides
that
whenever
peremptory
challenges
have
been
utilized
over
a
period
of
time
that
the
petitioner
has
or
the
defendant
has
to
prove
that
they
have
been
exercised
for
the
purpose
of
excluding,
like
in
this
particular
case,
blacks.
you
can't
look
at
the
one
isolated
situation.
mr.
rickie
l.
pearson
i
think
it
raises
a
reasonable
inference
that
he
is
doing
it
for
racial
reasons.
mr.
rickie
l.
pearson
i
agree,
it
is
the
inference.
mr.
rickie
l.
pearson
i
think
if
that
is
proved,
that--
mr.
rickie
l.
pearson
--under
swain
it
would.
mr.
rickie
l.
pearson
yes,
sir,
it
did.
mr.
rickie
l.
pearson
yes,
sir.
mr.
rickie
l.
pearson
because
the
test
in
swain
is
that
you
must
show
that
the
prosecutor
did
it
over
a
period
of
time.
mr.
rickie
l.
pearson
right.
mr.
rickie
l.
pearson
then
of
course--
mr.
rickie
l.
pearson
--we
will
submit
that
over
the
period
of
time
test,
which
is
the
one
that
carries
the
day,
when
you
have...
petitioner
has
proposed
a
remedy
on
the
wheeler
which
we
believe
to
be
a
subjective
test.
when
you
have
a
serious
allegation
such
as
invidious
or
intentional
or
purposeful
discrimination,
the
test
proposed
by
petitioner
under
wheeler
versus
california
we
believe
to
be
nebulous
and
subjective.
swain
we
believe
to
be
objective,
because
it
would
be
based
upon
verifiable
evidence
that
it
would
be
not
be
left
as
to
whether
or
not
the
prosecutor
answered,
gave
an
explanation
why
he
was
clothed
with
a
wardrobe
of
anticipated
answers
that
he
would
give
the
trial
judge.
the
trial
judge
then
would
have
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
believed
counsel
and,
of
course,
whether
or
not
there
was
a
strong
likelihood
that
there
had
been
discrimination
purely
based
on
numbers
wherein
a
situation
such
that
the
prosecutor
struck
two
blacks
out
of
four.
whether
or
not
that
is
a
strong
likelihood,
reasonable
judges
across
this
country
might
differ.
so,
i
think
that
wheeler
is
a
subjective
test,
that
it
is
nebulous
in
its
application,
that
it
is
not
sounding
in
fourteenth
amendment
principles.
another
problem
with
utilizing
the
wheeler
approach
is
this.
if
the
prosecution
is
required
to
explain
the
use
of
peremptory
challenges,
it
may
force
or
inhibit
his
exercise
of
peremptory
challenges
in
that
he
might
say,
well,
you
know,
i
am
not
going
to
strike
all
of
the
blacks
or
all
of
the
catholics
or
all
of
the
females
in
this
particular
case
because
i
might
give
rise
to
the
issue,
so
what
i
will
do
is
that
i
will
just
not
strike
all
of
them,
and
i
will
leave
a
jury
with
those
individuals
on
it,
although
i
know,
my
professional
experience
tells
me
that
i
should.
now,
by
requiring
an
explanation,
the
prosecution
can
skirt
the
issue
and
in
essence
create
what
we
would
call
an
artificial
quota
on
a
jury
or
for
that
fact
a
token
jury
in
which
he
would
have
absolutely
little
or
no
trust.
that
is
the
problem
with
wheeler.
mr.
rickie
l.
pearson
the
token,
i
think
if
you
leave
the
token
black
on
the
jury,
based
on
petitioner's
theory,
it
probably
wouldn't
satisfy
him,
but
i
am
thinking
that
that
is
a
problem
where
you
are
headed
if
you
adopt
wheeler.
you
are
talking
about
an
artificial
quota
because
the
prosecutor
would
feel
inhibited
from
exercising
peremptory
challenges.
consequently
that
would
make
a
fair
and
impartial
trial
secondary.
the
appearance
of
not
discriminating
would
be
the
primary
concern.
mr.
rickie
l.
pearson
i
don't
think
you
would.
i
think
that
would
be
a
constitutional
violation
in
and
of
itself,
for
the
simple--
mr.
rickie
l.
pearson
--yes,
sir.
yes.
mr.
rickie
l.
pearson
i
think
that
would
be
most
persuasive
for
a
defendant.
it
really
would.
but
i
think
that
in
and
of
itself
would
show
that
the
office
itself,
not
the
particular
prosecutor,
but
the
office
is
indeed
acting
on
invidious
discrimination
grounds,
and
that
would
be
a
constitutional
violation.
mr.
rickie
l.
pearson
i
think
the
difference
would
be
that
the
manual
would
be
policy,
policy
that
would
affect
the
entire
office
over
a
period
of
time.
in
the
other
scenario
where
you
are
dealing
with
the
particular
prosecutor,
he
is
in
that
particular
trial
dealing
with
that
particular
venire,
and
may
not
be
confronted
with
the
venire
of
that
type
for
a
time
to
come.
so
i
think
the
difference
is
that
the
policy
of
the
office
is
dictating
to
all
those
for
whom...
all
the
prosecutors
who
are
working
for
the
office
that
that
is
the
attitude
and
the
approach
i
think
you
should
take
always
whenever.
mr.
rickie
l.
pearson
if
i
understand
your
question,
the
policy
man--
mr.
rickie
l.
pearson
--right.
mr.
rickie
l.
pearson
i
think
that...
well,
i
see
the
difference
probably
moving
more
toward--
mr.
rickie
l.
pearson
--the
difference
moving
more
toward
him
being
a
discriminatory
type
individual,
and
that
that
is
a
basis--
mr.
rickie
l.
pearson
--that
wouldn't
be
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
rickie
l.
pearson
no,
sir,
all
policy
does
not
have
to
be
in
writing.
in
closing,
we
believe
that
by
adopting
the
wheeler
approach,
there
would
be
a
destruction
of
the
presumption
of
the
proper
use
of
peremptory
challenges
by
the
prosecution,
and
as
a
result
of
that
it
might
cause
an
erosion
of
professional
as
well
as
public
trust,
be
it
the
prosecutor
himself
or
the
prosecution's
office.
because
wheeler
is
so
subjective,
and
swain
is
indeed
objective,
and
based
on
verifiable
facts
in
evidence,
we
believe
under
those
circumstances
swain
should
be
reaffirmed.
in
closing,
we
believe
that
the
trial
court
of
kentucky
and
the
supreme
court
of
kentucky
have
firmly
embraced
swain,
and
we
respectfully
request
that
this
court
affirm
the
opinion
of
the
kentucky
court
as
well
as
to
reaffirm
swain
versus
alabama.
thank
you.
