justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
all
this
long
period
of
time,
i
assume...
well,
how
long
would
he
have
to
be
a
prosecutor
before
he
could
have
that
protection?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
is
over
a
period
of
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
a
good
constitutional
rule,
isn't
it,
without
any
time
at
all.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
think
that
is
what
swain
said?
justice
thurgood
marshall
--denied
peremptories
to
both
sides?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said
both
sides.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
violates
what
section
of
the
constitution?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
that
violate
the
constitution?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
both
sides
are
denied
peremptory
challenges.
justice
thurgood
marshall
perfectly
all
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
let's
examine
that.
what
i
think
you
are
building
on
is
that
you
can
take
a
peremptory
challenge
without
giving
any
reason.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
are
building
that
that
you
can
give
it
for
a
violation
of
the
constitution,
and
those
are
two
different
animals.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
a
state
officer
says
i
am
using
race
in
my
enforcement
of
my
law,
doesn't
that
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
didn't
say
over
a
period
of
time.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
does
it
once.
doesn't
he
violate
the
constitution?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
many
times?
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
you
give
me
any
case
that
says
that
a
constitutional
right
has
to
be
denied
a
number
of
times?
justice
thurgood
marshall
including
swain.
justice
thurgood
marshall
including
swain.
did
swain
say
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
the
policy
man
wrote
the
book.
justice
thurgood
marshall
wrote
the
manual
that
the
chief
justice
is
talking
about.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
same
man
that
you
said
didn't
do
it
right,
he
did
it
this
time
right.
tell
me
the
difference.
justice
thurgood
marshall
make
me
see.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
a
prosecutor
reads
a
piece
of
paper
saying
that.
would
that
make
it
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
all
policy
have
to
be
in
writing?
