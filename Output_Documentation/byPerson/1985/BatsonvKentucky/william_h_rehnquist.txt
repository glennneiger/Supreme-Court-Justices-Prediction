justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
i
understand
the
california
rule,
it
also
applies
to
peremptories
by
defendants?
am
i
correct?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that
would
follow
along
with
your
argument?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
i
think
at
least
speaking
for
myself
i
would
like
to
know
what
the
consequences,
the
logical
consequences
of
adopting
your
rule
are,
and
i
take
it
if
most
state
courts
have
adopted
it
and
felt
obliged
to
extend
it
to
defendants,
that
might
well
be
a
logical
consequence.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
of
course
you
want
us
to
go
further
than
that.
you
want
something,
you
want
a
representative
panel
as
opposed
to
just
a
representative
venire.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
they
wouldn't
succeed
as
challenges
for
cause?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
one
thing
he
can't
say,
i
suppose,
is
that
this
venire
person
is
black,
and
the
defendant
is
black,
and
therefore
i
would
rather
have
a
white
juror
than
a
black
juror.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
a
prosecutor
strikes
whites
because
he
is
afraid
that
the
whites...
let's
say
the
principal
witness
for
the
prosecution
is
a
black,
although
the
defendant
is
white,
and
the
prosecutor
strikes
whites
because
he
is
afraid
they
are
less
likely
to
believe
the
black
witness
than
perhaps
a
substitute
black
juror.
now,
is
that
a
violation
of
the
constitution?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
is
all
the
facts
you
have.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
whites
as
a
class
tend
not
to
believe
blacks
as
witnesses?
that
is
a
good
enough
reason?
