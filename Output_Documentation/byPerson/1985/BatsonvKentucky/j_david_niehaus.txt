mr.
j.
david
niehaus
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
issue
presented
today
arose
out
of
a
state
criminal
proceeding
in
jefferson
county,
kentucky,
in
which
the
prosecutor
employed
four
of
the
six
peremptory
challenges
that
were
allotted
to
him
under
court
rule
to
remove
all
black
persons
on
the
panel
of
jurors.
these
panel
members
had
all
survived
the
challenges
for
cause
under
the
kentucky
system,
which
is
called
the
blind
strike
system,
and
peremptory
challenges
are
made
at
all...
at
the
close
of
all
challenges
for
cause,
and
they
are
made
by
means
of
striking
from
identical
lists
simultaneously
names
of
the
jurors
that
either
party
wishes
to
have
removed.
but
before
the
jury
was
sworn,
trial
counsel
for
petitioner
made
a
motion
to
discharge
the
panel
on
the
ground
that
the
removal
of
the
four
blacks
by
these
peremptory
challenges
denied
the
right
to
trial
by
an
impartial
jury
under
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendments
to
the
constitution
and
also
denied
equal
protection
of
the
law.
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
no,
your
honor.
the
petitioner
asked
for
a
hearing
on
his
motion,
but
it
was
denied
basically
on
the
ground
that
anybody
can
strike
anybody
they
want
to.
those
are
the
words
of
the
trial
judge
in
the
case.
the
same
issue
was
raised
on
appeal,
on
direct
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
kentucky,
and
that
court
also
affirmed
by
stating
that
an
allegation
of
lack
of
a
fair
cross
section
on
a
jury
which
does
not
concern
systematic
exclusion
from
the
jury
drum,
which
is
the
composition
device
for
the
jury
list,
does
not
rise
to
constitutional
proportions,
and
therefore
the
court
refused
to
adopt
any
law.
i
think
as
the
court
can
see,
neither
of
the
trial
court
nor
the
supreme
court
of
kentucky
was
willing
to
consider
any
regulation
of
peremptory
challenges,
and
i
think
both
followed
the
conventional
interpretation
of
swain
versus
alabama
which
this
court
decided
in
1965.
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
your
honor,
that
was
not
raised
in
this
particular
case,
although
it
certainly
could.
it
was
not
argued,
although
it
was
mentioned,
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
they
could
have
proceeded
on
that
basis.
the
conventional
interpretation
of
swain
is
that
there
can
be
no
question
of
peremptory
challenges
and
the
way
that
they
are
exercised
in
any
one
particular
case.
this
has
been
the
basis
for
decisions
of
the
many
state
courts
who
have
refused
to
consider
the
newer
rules
that
have
been
advanced
by
the
supreme
court
of
california,
the
court
in
massachusetts,
and
more
recently
by
two
federal
appellate
courts.
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
yes.
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
yes.
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
that
is
what
we
are
arguing,
yes.
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
we
have
not
made
an
equal
protection
claim.
i
think
that
swain
will
have
to
be
reconsidered
to
a
certain
extent
if
only
to
consider
the
arguments
that
are
made
on
behalf
of
affirmance
by
the
respondent
and
the
solicitor
general.
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
swain
within
the
conventional
interpretation
simply
states
that
no
attack
can
be
made
on
the
exercise
in
one
particular
case,
and
as
the
record
in
this
case
shows
no
more
than
what
happened
in
this
one
particular
case.
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
certainly.
the
sixth
amendment?
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
i
believe
that
we
will
be
attacking
it
in
the
course
of
our
argument,
your
honor,
because
i
think
that
the
bases
that
underlie
the
proof
standard
in
swain
have
been
eroded
somewhat
by
a
reexamination
of
the
historical--
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
--we
have
not
made
a
specific
argument
in
the
briefs
that
have
been
filed
either
in
the
supreme
court
of
kentucky
or
in
this
court
saying
that
we
are
attacking
swain
as
such.
we
have
maintained
that
because
the
sixth
amendment
guarantees
a
right
to
a
jury
that
is
as
representative
of
the
community
as
possible,
that
the
court
may
proceed
on
that
basis
alone
and
may
or
may
not
have
to
alter
its
holding
in
swain
in
order
to
achieve
its
desire.
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
no
case
specifically
holds
what
we
are
asking
for
today.
the
most
apposite
case,
which
of
course
is
taylor
versus
louisiana,
speaks
only
to
the
panels
from
which
the
petit
jury
is
actually
selected.
we
are
asking
for
an
extension.
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
i
think
that
that
is
quite
so,
and
as
long
as
these
peremptory
challenges
are
exercised
for
some
reason
related
to
the
matter
at
hand,
i
think
that
the
cause
for
objection
is
going
to
be
removed.
if
the
court
will
recall
the
remedy
that
we
have
proposed
in
this
case,
which
is
based
primarily
on
the
supreme
court
of
california's
rules
set
out
in
wheeler,
if
there
is
some
reason
that
explains
in
the
context
of
a
particular
case,
and
i
would
ask
the
court
to
note
that
in
the
first
section
of
swain
the
court
also
linked
the
exercise
of
peremptory
challenges
to
the
context
of
a
particular
case.
if
this
explanation
is
satisfactory,
then
certainly
groups
will
and
probably
should
be
removed,
but
it
is
the
argument
here
that
if
they
are
being
removed,
as
in
this
case,
simply
for
reasons
of
race,
this
is
a
destruction
of
the
representative
nature
of
the
jury
without
sufficient
reason,
and
for
that
reason
the
peremptory
challenges
that
are
exercised
must
be
regulated.
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
yes.
most
of
the
courts
have
adopted
that--
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
--your
honor,
we
have
not
put
that
argument
forward
simply
because
it
is
not
necessary
to
obtain
the
relief
we
desire
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
oh,
i
think
that
it
could
be,
your
honor,
but
the
court
could
also
consider--
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
--this
is
quite
right,
your
honor,
but
the
courts
that
have
addressed
the
matter
and
more
recently
the
case
in
booker
versus
jade
from
the
sixth
circuit,
which
we
have
not
had
time
to
file
with
the
court,
simply
talks
about
fairness
between
the
parties,
and
that
it
does
tend
to
diminish
the
perception
of
fairness
in
the
eyes
of
the
public,
and
those
courts
have
perceived
a...
i
guess
you
would
say
a
right
emanating,
although
not
specifically
state,
out
of
the
sixth
amendment,
wherein
the
courts
may
impose
the
same
rule
on
the
defendant
in
order
to
bring
out
the
confidence
necessary
for--
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
simply
overrule
swain
without
adopting
the
remedy?
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
i
do
not
think
that
would
give
us
much
comfort,
your
honor,
no.
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
pardon?
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
the
court
has
always
recognized
that
a
jury
must
be
representative
of
the
community
in
order
to
discharge
its
function.
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
the
cases
that
have
been
decided
by
this
court
in
particular
speak
about
the
panel
that
is
set
up.
no
case
that
i
have
been
able
to
find
gets
down
directly
to
the
petit
jury.
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
yes,
your
honor.
but
before
speaking
about
the
court's
cases,
beal
of
glasser,
there
has
always
been
this
idea--
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
--no,
it
was
equal
protection
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
put
even
before
this
court's
cases
decided
in
the
<nineteen
forty's>
[=
1940's]
under
the
supervisory
power,
there
has
always
been
an
idea
that
the
jury
must
be
representative
of
the
community,
and
we
have
provided
in
our
brief
a
compilation
of
some
statements
on
this
fact.
and
the
practical
reason
for
this
is
to
interpose
a
body
of
untrained
citizens
between
the
defendant
and
the
forces
of
the
prosecutor,
so
that
when
the
prosecutor
employs
his
challenges
to
remove
a
cognizable
group
from
the
jury
that
is
actually
going
to
sit,
he
is
destroying
any
chance
that
this
jury
is
going
to
be
as
representative
of
the
jury
as
is
possible,
given
the
fact
that
you
must
reduce
the
community
to
a
panel
and
finally
to
a
petit
jury
of
12
or
13.
when
the
prosecutor
does
this,
he
is
attacking
the
democratic
aspect
of
the
jury
wherein
the
community
consents
to
the
conviction.
it
is
not
left
simply
to
the
administrative
officers
in
charge
of
the
matter,
but
the
community
itself
by
its
representatives'
consent.
the
federal
courts
of
appeal
have
begun
adopting
a
rule
that
basically
follows
the
rule
set
out
in
wheeler
versus
california,
and
these
cases
reject
the
convoluted
and
probably
often
poorly
understood
statistical
analyses
that
are
associated
with
the
venire
composition
cases,
and
have
instead
returned
to
what
i
consider
to
be
a
more
well
known
pattern
of
evidentiary
inferences,
and
all
of
the
cases
that
are
listed
in
the
briefs
begin
with
the
concept
announced
in
taylor
versus
louisiana
which
talks
about
the
federal
right
to
jury
trial,
and
that
is
that
the
selection
of
a
petit
jury
from
a
representative
cross
section
of
the
community
is
an
essential
component
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
trial
by
jury.
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
yes,
we
want
a
representative
petit
jury
if
that
is
possible.
we
realize
that
because
of
the
problem
in
reducing
numbers,
that
that
is
not
going
to
happen
in
every
case,
and
i
don't
think
that
a
criminal
defendant
can
complain
about
that.
but
i
think
that
if
an
agent
of
the
state
is
employing
a
state-provided
procedural
device
to
make
sure
that
the
jury
is
not
going
to
be
representative
and
that
there
is
no
reason
connected
with
the
trial
that
this
agent
of
the
state
is
doing
so,
then
the
defendant
does
have
a
right
to
complain.
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
i
do
not
find
any
cases
talking
about
that.
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
i
would
ask
the
judge
to
take
note
of
the
persons
in
the
jury,
the
actual
panel
who
was
brought
from
the
pool
to
the
room.
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
i
think
that
he
does
not
need
to
know
those
facts.
he
needs
to
know
how
many,
to
use
the
example
in
this
case,
how
many
black
jurors
are
brought
from
the
jury
pool
to
his
room.
if
they
disappear,
not
through
challenges
for
cause,
but
if
they
disappear
through
the
exercise
of
peremptory
challenges
by
the
prosecutor,
then
i
think
that
the
judge
has--
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
--i
think
so,
because
if
they
are
challenged
for
cause,
that
means
that
they
have
some
reason
that
they
have
articulated--
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
--certainly,
but
again,
that
is
a
question
of
securing
an
impartial
jury.
now,
it
may
be
that
the
prosecutor
by
exercising
his
peremptory
challenges
is
taking
note
that
that
juror
has
been
staring
at
my...
or
staring
at
the
police
officer
sitting
next
to
me
throughout
the
entire
process,
and
under
the
wheeler
rule
that
we
are
urging,
the
trial
judge
or
the
prosecutor,
rather,
is
entitled
to
point
this
out.
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
i
think
that
under
the
kentucky
system,
that
that
is
probably
the
way
the
relief
must
be
done,
because
peremptory
challenges
are
exercised
all
at
once
at
the
close
of
challenges
for
cause.
in
california
and
some
other
states
it
is
an
ongoing
process,
and
a
pattern
can
emerge
as
the
challenges
are
exercised,
but
the
evidence
that
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
is
that
provided
for
by
wheeler
pointing
out,
first
of
all,
that
out
of
so
many
challenges
that
are
available
to
the
prosecutor,
he
has
used
x
number
to
remove
all
members
of
this
one
particular
group.
under
the
principles
announced
in
wheeler,
this
is
sufficient
in
many
cases.
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
yes.
i
think
that
the--
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
--two
are
left
on
the
jury?
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
i
think
probably
so
because
of
the--
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
--probably
that
there
is
reason
for
complaint
because
he
has
used
a
disproportionate
number
in
order
to--
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
--remain
on?
that
is
getting
to
be
a
closer
situation,
and
it
is
something
that--
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
--i
believe
that
it
is
still
a
close
situation.
it
depends
on
the
other
facts
that
are
available
to
the
trial
judge.
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
one,
under
the
doctrine
of
chances
that
we
have
articulated
in
our
brief,
it
gets
to
be
a
very
narrow
matter,
and
perhaps
you
cannot
make
any
inference
from
that
as
to
noninnocent
intent
unless
there
are
other--
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
--it
depends
on
whether
there
are
other
facts
known.
i
think
that
the
defense
lawyer
and
the
trial
judge
can
take
into
account
the
history
of
this
particular
prosecutor.
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
he
can
point
out
what
it
was
about
these
particular
juries
that
he
did
not
like.
he
can
say
that
one
was
staring
at
his
police
officer.
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
i
don't
believe
so,
and
i
don't
believe
that
has
been
the
experience
in
the
jurisdictions
that
have
adopted
this
rule,
that
he
must
state
some
reason.
it
may
be
that,
to
give
the
court
an
example--
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
--those
are
reasons
that
are
not
tied
to
the
fact
that
this
juror
is
simply
a
black.
and
so
that
these
might
be
satisfactory
answers
under
the
rule.
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
true.
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
i
think
so,
because
it
is...
the
fact
that
the
prospective
juror
is
a
black
rather
than
any
reason
why,
any
articulable
reason
why
there
is
a
specific
suspected
bias
that
is
the
motivating
cause
for
removal
of
this
juror.
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
i
think
that
presents
a
different--
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
--well,
the
harm
is
there,
perhaps,
but
maybe
not
as
severe,
because
in
most
areas
of
the
country
i
believe
that
even
if
a
defendant
exercises
all
of
his
challenges,
he
will
not
succeed
in
eradicating
all
white
persons
from
the
jury.
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
yes.
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
i
think
that
it
is
not
as
serious
a
problem.
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
pardon?
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
i
think
that
is
exactly
the
point,
that
there
is
no
state
action
involved
where
the
defendant
is
exercising
his
peremptory
challenge.
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
i
believe
that
is
possible.
i
am
really
not
prepared
to
answer
that
specific
question,
but
the
idea
of
the
bill
of
rights
is
to
afford
protection
to
the
specific
defendant.
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
i
think
that
it
is
because
it
is
specific
to
the
matter
at
hand.
of
course,
i
believe
there
would
have
to
be
a
few
more
facts
known.
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
i
think
that
that
is
specific
enough
to
the
proceeding
at
hand.
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
if
that
is
all
that
is
known,
then
i
think
not.
it
is
hard
to
make
a
definite
prediction
in
that
specific
instance,
but
probably
not,
because
the
idea
is
not...
is
that
the
group
itself
is
not
the
predictor
of
what
the
person
is
going
to
do,
so
that
for
that
reason
i
think
it
would
probably
not
be
a
sufficient
reason.
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
by
the
defense?
we
have
mentioned
some
considerations
in
our
brief--
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
--that
i
believe
that
because
they
have
been
in
existence
for
such
a
long
time,
that
they
may
be,
even
though
they
were
not
specifically
incorporated
into
the
document,
they
may
be
of
such
importance
along
an
analysis
like
williams
versus
florida
and--
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
--yes,
your
honor.
and
they
are,
i
believe,
of
rather
recent
origin.
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
yes.
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
no,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
as
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
tell,
the
defendant
usually
has
anywhere
from
one
to
two
to
several
more,
depending
on
what
the
state
has
decided
to
provide.
i
believe
the
necessity
for
the
change
is
shown
by
the
large
number
of
complaints
that
have
been
made
in
recent
years
concerning
the
practice
of
peremptory
challenges
used
by
the
prosecutor
to
remove
specific
groups.
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
that
was
filed
on
behalf
of
batson
we
were
able
to
list
some
25
jurisdictions.
since
that
time
i
believe
five
or
six
more
jurisdictions
have
considered
the
matter,
and
this
has
come
to
a
point
that
the
court
must
rethink
its
decision
in
swain
and
look
again
at
the
two
premises
on
which
the
swain
decision
was
predicated,
that
of
the
history
of
the
peremptory
challenge
and
also
of
the
function.
i
think
in
answer
to
justice
white's
questions,
we
have
spoken
somewhat
about
the
history
and
as
our
brief
shows
the
peremptory
challenge
that
is
a
peremptory
challenge
for
the
prosecutor
has
been
in
existence
probably
for
only
about
150
years.
before
that
time,
as
the
cases
show,
the
process
of
standing
aside
was
under
the
control
of
the
trial
court,
and
if
the
prosecutor
used
too
this
device
too
much,
against
too
many
prospective
jurors,
the
trial
court
could
intervene,
so
that
regulation
was
the
norm
before
the
middle
part
of
the
last
century.
i
think
a
more
important
reason
is
that
at
the
time
swain
was
decided
this
court
had
nothing
to
look
at
in
terms
of
whether
peremptory
challenges
could
serve
their
function
of
removing
jurors
who
might
be
biased
but
whom
the
parties
could
not
show
to
be
biased
without
interfering
with
that
practice
that
now
the
practice
can
be
regulated,
and
this
is
shown
by
the
number
of
jurisdictions
that
have
adopted
the
rule.
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that--
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
--i
believe
there
are
six
now.
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
california,
massachusetts,
new
jersey,
florida,
new
mexico,
and,
i
believe,
delaware,
and
two
federal
appellate
circuits,
the
second
and
the
sixth.
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
several
others
are
left
on?
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
i
think
not,
although
i
think
not--
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
--yes.
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
the
use
of
numbers
shows
what
the
prosecutor
is
about,
so
that
the
more
jurors
that
are
removed,
the
greater
the
certainty
is
that
he
is
doing
so
for
some
nonrelated
reason.
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
yes,
i
think
that
the
whole
rule
is
premised
on
the
fact
that
the
lawyers
involved
will
tell
the
court
the
truth.
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
i
think
that
it
would
be
a
violation,
although
perhaps
not
under
the
theory
that
we
are
advancing
here
today.
the
theory
that
we
are
advancing
here
today
has
to
do
with--
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
--with
what
the
jury
is,
and
so
as
long
as
the
jury
is
more
or
less
representative
of
the
community
under
this
theory
there
are
other
means
to
attack.
mr.
j.
david
niehaus
yes.
if
i
may
just
point,
and
i
will
try
to
reserve
a
moment
or
two
for
rebuttal,
that
the
court
has
the
benefit
of
a
brief
filed
on
behalf
of
the
kings
county
district
attorney's
office
in
new
york,
and
this
brief
shows
the
experience
of
four
years
operating
under
the
system
of
allowing
questions
of
the
peremptory
challenges,
and
that
office
says
there
is
no
difficulty,
and
i
would
point
that
out
to
the
court,
that
because
a
peremptory
challenge
can
be
effective,
and
can
also
be
questioned
in
certain
instances,
that
there
is
no
reason
not
to
adopt
the
rule
that
we
are
asking
for
today.
if
i
may
reserve
a
few
moments
for
rebuttal.
