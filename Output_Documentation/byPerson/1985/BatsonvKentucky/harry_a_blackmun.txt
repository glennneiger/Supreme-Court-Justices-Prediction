justice
harry
a.
blackmun
were
you
trial
counsel?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
why
do
you
fall
short
of
a
direct
attack
on
swain
on
equal
protection?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
swain
preceded
the
time,
did
it
not,
when
the
amendment
was
made
applicable
to
the
states?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
i
ask
again,
why
don't
you
attack
swain
head
on?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
though
you
just
answered
justice
o'connor
by
saying,
no,
you
weren't
really
attacking
swain
except
by
implication.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
i
come
back
again
to
my
question
why
you
didn't
attack
swain
head
on,
but
i
take
it
if
the
court
were
to
overrule
swain,
you
wouldn't
like
that
result.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
is
a
concession.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
said,
that
is
a
concession.
