mr.
niehaus,
swain
was
an
equal
protection
challenge,
was
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
your
claim
here
is
based
solely
on
the
sixth
amendment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
correct?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
are
not
asking
for
a
reconsideration
of
swain,
and
you
are
making
no
equal
protection
claim
here.
is
that
correct?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
can
you
do
that
under
a
sixth
amendment
claim?
i
can
understand
how
you
could
reach
that
result
under
an
equal
protection
claim,
which
you
aren't
making,
but
i
don't
see
how
the
sixth
amendment
does
anything
but
speak
to
the
defendant's
own
rights.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
certainly
is
doctrinally
difficult
to
justify
under
the
sixth
amendment,
isn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
there
might
be
under
an
equal
protection
challenge
if
it
is
the
state
system
that
allows
that
kind
of
a
strike.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
have
to
make
an
equal
protection
challenge
to
take
care
of
the
single
strike
in
the
example
given
by
justice
stevens,
don't
you?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
now,
that
isn't
what
the
other
side
says
at
all.
they
say
the
issue
is
one
of
whether
the
sixth
amendment
should
apply.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
wallace,
if
the
challenge
here
were
being
made
to
swain
itself
under
the
equal
protection
clause
as
opposed
to
the
sixth
amendment,
would
you
be
here
and
making
the
same
argument?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
if
the
prosecutor
openly
admits
that
he
is
striking
all
jurors
of
a
particular
race
because
of
their
race?
