justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
you
one
question
about
the
theory
of
your
case?
you
have
indicated
a
lot
of
practical
discussions
here,
and
in
response
to
justice
brennan
you
weren't
sure
how
you
come
out
on
different
numbers
of
challenges,
four,
three,
two,
one.
but
i
would
like
to
know
if
you...
say
there
is
only
one
challenge
of
a
black
as
a
peremptory
challenge,
and
the
judge
asks,
why
did
you
challenge,
as
he
just
does,
and
he
says,
well,
i
don't
have
to
tell
you,
but
i
will.
the
only
reason
i
challenged
him
is
because
he
is
black,
and
i
think
a
black
is
more
likely
to
return
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
if
the
defendant
is
black.
that
is
my
only
reason,
and
also,
i
am
a
little
bit
prejudiced
against
blacks.
would
there
be
a
constitutional
violation
or
not?
say
he
left
several
other
blacks
on
the
jury.
in
your
opinion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
would
that
be
a
constitutionally
permissible
thing
for
a
prosecutor
do
if
the
reason
for
his
action
is
right
on
the
table?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
questions
about
the
numbers
then
go
to
the
difficulty
of
ascertaining
whether
that
is
true.
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
whether
there
is
a
constitutional
violation
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
would
be
wrong
with
the
judge's
asking
the
prosecutor?
don't
you
have
to
assume
the
prosecutor
would
probably
tell
the
truth?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt,
mr.
pearson?
supposing
he
had
asked
the
prosecutor,
why
did
you
strike
the
four
blacks,
and
the
prosecutor
had
said,
because
i
believe
blacks
are
unlikely
to
convict
a
black
defendant,
and
i
don't
particularly
like
blacks.
would
that
constitute
a
constitutionally
impermissible
exercise
of
state
power?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
it
wouldn't
have
violated
swain.
i
just
think...
i
am
asking
you
really
if
you
think
in
today's
jurisprudence
that
would
be
consistent
with
our
present
approach
to
both
the
right
to
an
impartial
jury
and
the
interpretation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
pearson,
really
this
is
kind
of
an
extra
argument,
because
if
the
explanation
couldn't
harm
the
prosecutor
anyway,
it
doesn't
really
make
any
difference
whether
it
is
required.
if
you
are
correcting
your
basic
submission
that
it
is
perfectly
all
right
for
the
prosecutor
to
challenge
because
he
doesn't
like
that
person's
race,
and
it
is
the
same
as
the
race
of
the
defendant,
you
don't
have
to
convince
us
of
anything
else.
there
is
no
reason
to
ask
for
explanations.
if
you
give
that
explanation,
you
still
win.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wallace,
let
me
take
you
one
step
further.
supposing
the
prosecutor
never
tried
a
case
before.
it
was
his
first
case.
there
was
only
one
black
on
the
venire.
he
challenges
him.
the
judge
says,
why
did
you
challenge
him?
he
says,
because
i
don't
think
a
black
is
qualified
to
sit
on
a
jury
as
far
as
i'm
concerned
because
i
don't
like
blacks.
constitutional
violation
or
no?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
probably?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let's
take
it
one
step
further.
he
doesn't
say
that,
but
he
says,
the
defendant
is
black,
and
i
think
blacks
are
more
apt
to
vote
to
acquit
blacks
than
white
are,
and
for
that
reason
i
just
don't
want
any
blacks
on
this
jury.
is
that
a
constitutional
permissible
reason
for
excluding
a
black
from
a
jury?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
care
about
swain.
what
do
you
think
the
law
is
today?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
be
permissible
for
a
judge
to
challenge
a
jury
for
cause
on
that
ground?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
state
can
do
it
through
the
prosecutor,
but
not
through
the
judge.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
wouldn't
it
be
permissible
for
a
judge
do
to
that?
he
might
say,
yes,
i
agree
with
you,
i
think
blacks
are
more
apt
to
acquit
blacks.
say
he
thought
that.
why
is
that
different
from
the
prosecutor?
