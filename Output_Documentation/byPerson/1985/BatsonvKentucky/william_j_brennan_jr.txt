justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
niehaus,
suppose
he
has
six
peremptories
and
he
exercises
four.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
there
are
two
others,
blacks
who
are
on
the
jury.
do
you
have
a
case
now?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
two
are
left,
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
probably
so
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let
me
change
the
number
then.
he
exercises
three
of
the
six,
and
three
blacks
are
on
the
jury.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
right.
two.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
say
perhaps
you
may
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
do
you
distinguish
the
instruction
in
the
manual
from
the
hypothetical
justice
white
asked
you
earlier,
namely,
when
the
prosecutor
in
a
given
case
says,
i
always
do
it,
i
don't
want
any
blacks,
i
have
a
black
defendant?
how
do
you
distinguish
them?
