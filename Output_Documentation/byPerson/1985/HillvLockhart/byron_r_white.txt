justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
really
didn't,
did
he?
he
didn't
know
what
he
was
going
to
get.
the
judge
wasn't
bound.
they
could
have
given
him
50
years.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
he
expected
to
get
35
years
and
the
judge
gave
him
50.
do
you
think
he
would
have
some
right
to
habeas
corpus
just
bared
on
that,
if
that's
all
that
happened?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
wouldn't
be
the
end
of
it,
even
if
you
believed
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
the
ineffectiveness
claim
really
boil
down
to
the
same
issue
as
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
the
plea,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
it,
in
any
event,
have
to
undermine
the
voluntariness
of
the
plea?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
defendant's
lawyer
just
advised
him
that
parole
is
available
and
usually,
if
you
behave
yourself,
it
will
be
one-third,
and
it
turns
out
that
for
this
crime
parole
just
isn't
available
at
all,
which
is
true
of
some
crimes?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
those
were
the
facts
in
this
case,
would
you
say
that
he
was
entitled
to
a
hearing
or
not?
i
thought
your
submission
was
that
misadvice
about
parole
really
shouldn't
amount
to
a
constitutional
violation
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
say...
if
the
facts
in
my
example
were
the
facts
of
this
case,
would
you
say
that
this
gentleman
should
have
been
given
the
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
district
court
on
his
application
for
habeas?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
dispute
that...
who
put
the
zero
in?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
attorney
general
says
that
the
defendant
and
his
counsel
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
imagine
it?
i
mean,
you
don't
contest
that
statement,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
claim
the
prosecutor
did?
