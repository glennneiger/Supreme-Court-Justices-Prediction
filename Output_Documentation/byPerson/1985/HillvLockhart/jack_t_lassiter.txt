mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
issue
presented
in
hill
v.
lockhart
is
rather
a
technical
and
narrow
issue,
but
one
t
think
is
significant
in
the
daily
workings
of
the
criminal
courts.
petitioner
william
hill
entered
a
guilty
plea
in
the
pulaski
county
circuit
court
in
1979
to
charges
of
murder
and
theft
of
property.
he
received
a
35-year
sentence
on
the
first
degree
murder
conviction
and
a
concurrent
ten-year
sentence
on
the
theft
of
property
conviction.
in
his
habeas
petition
which
he
filed
pro
se,
which
appears
in
the
joint
appendix
a:
8
and
9
he
alleged
that
he
bled
with
the
understanding
that
he
would
receive
a
35-year
sentence
and
that
he
would
be
parole
eligible
after
serving
one-third
of
his
sentence,
less
good
time.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
it's
at
8
and
9
in
the
joint
appendix.
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
is
set
forth
there.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
eight
and
9.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
he
also
indicated
that
his
lawyer
told
him
that
the
court
would
impose
a
35-year
sentence.
he
alleged
that
his
lawyer
told
him
that
he
would
be
out
in
six
years
if
he
stayed
out
of
trouble.
he
alleged
that
he
was
not
advised
of
act
93
which
rendered
him
parole
ineligible
until
serving
one-half
of
his
sentence
less
good
time,
since
he
was
a
second
offender.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
justice
rehnquist,
that
does
not
appear
in
his
pleading.
at
a
hearing,
if
we
were
granted
a
hearing
in
this
matter,
of
course
this
is
not
of
record,
that
would
be
his
testimony.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
that's
correct.
of
course,
our
position
is
that
if
he
didn't
tell
counsel,
counsel
should
have
inquired
about
that,
that
that
would
be
part
of
the
diligence
that
counsel
should
demonstrate
in
defending
one
in
a
criminal
case,
and
i
think
we
could
also
demonstrate
that
at
a
hearing.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
no,
the
record
does
not
reflect
that.
there
was
no
advice
from
the
court
concerning
potential
parole
eligibility
if
he
pled
or
if
he
went
to
trial.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
regardless
of
whether
he
pled
or
went
to
trial,
he
would
be
parole
ineligible
until
serving
one-half,
less
whatever
good
time
had
accrued.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
we
allege
voluntariness,
he
alleges,
we
allege
that
the
plea
was
not
voluntarily
entered.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
that's
correct,
and
we
also
do
not
claim
that
the
court
was
under
a
duty
to
advise
petitioner
as
to
potential
parole
eligibility.
we
don't
make
that
claim.
we
make
the
claim
that
his
counsel
affirmatively
misadvised
him;
that
is,
he
told
him
that
he
would
be
parole
eligible
at
serving
one-third
less
good
time
that
he
told
him
that
would
be
about
six
years
if
he
stayed
out
of
trouble,
that
he
would
not
have
entered
the
plea
except
for
that
advice,
that
he
would
not
have
entered
the
plea
if
he
had
known
that
he
would
not
be
parole
eligible
until
serving
one-half
less
good
time.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
his
name
is
william
patterson.
he
was
the
deputy
public
defender.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
patterson
died
in
the
summer
of
1980.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
it
is
determined
by
the
arkansas
department
of
corrections.
when
the
inmate
is
received
at
the
department
of
corrections
they
will
check
his
prior
record
through
the
arkansas
crime
information
center
and
the
fbi,
and
then
if
they
find
a
prior
felony
conviction
for
which
he
was
incarcerated,
then
they
use
that
in
computing
his
parole
eligibility
that
date.
the
state
does
not
have
to
allege
and
prove
prior
convictions
as
part
of
the
trial
process
or
plea
process.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
petition
without
a
hearing.
the
eighth
circuit
affirmed,
the
eighth
circuit
holding
that
details
of
parole
eligibility
are
a
collateral
and
not
a
direct
consequence
of
the
plea
and
therefore
cannot
render
mr.
hill's
plea
involuntary.
and
also,
the
eighth
circuit
looks
at
the
fourth
circuit
cases
of
strader
versus
o'tuel
discussed
in
the
brief
and
finds
here
that
counsel's
misadvice,
alleged,
does
not
rise
to
the
level
of
gross
misinformation
as
addressed
in
strader
and
o'tuel.
there
is
one
matter
here
that
i
would
like
to
address
initially
because
the
cases
cited
in
the
brief,
a
number
of
them,
distinguish
between
what
we
call
positive
misadvice
and
statements
by
counsel
that
are
called
a
mere
prediction,
or
present
only
a
hope
of
leniency.
the
state
argues
that
in
the
situation
that
mr.
hill
found
himself
in,
and
with
the
series
of
events
as
alleged
by
mr.
hill,
that
this
could
only...
that
counsel's
advice
here
could
only
be
of
a
speculative
nature,
just
an
estimate,
and
cannot
rise
to
the
level
of
being
positive
misadvice,
and
the
state
argues
that
that
is
so
because
under
the
arkansas
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
the
trial
judge
does
not
have
to
accept
the
recommendation
of
the
state.
now,
that
is
correct,
under
the
arkansas
rules
of
criminal
procedure
the
trial
judge
does
not
have
to
accept
the
recommendation
of
the
state.
but
we're
not
sure
exactly
what
happened
here.
mr.
hill
alleged
that
counsel
told
him
that
the
judge
would
accept
the
plea
under
the
arkansas
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
there
is
a
provision
which
allows
the
attorneys
to
discuss
the
plea
with
the
court
beforehand,
and
the
court
can
either
accept
or
indicate
that
the
court
will
accept
or
reject.
that
may
have
happened
here,
we're
not
sure.
if
we
had
a
hearing
on
this
matter,
i
also
think
that
i
could
show
that
this
particular
judge
at
that
time
in
1979
accepted
almost
all
recommendations
from
the
state
on
negotiated
pleas,
and
it
was
his
practice,
if
he
was
not
going
to
accept
that
recommendation,
to
allow
the
defendant
to--
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
--five
to
50,
or
life.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
well,
the
allegation
is
that
he
entered
the
plea
based
on
advice
by
counsel
that
he
would
receive
the
35
years,
and
he
did
receive
the
35
years,
and
that
he
relied
on
that
in
entering
the
plea.
if
he
had
received
a
50-year
sentence
then
the
same
parole
laws
would
have
been
in
effect.
he
would
have
had
to
have
served
one-half
less
good
time
and
not
one-third
less
good
time,
as
counsel
told
him
he
would
have
to
serve.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
well,
i
think
i
have
to
address
the
issue
of
what
sentence
that
the
lawyer
told
him
he
would
get,
in
order
to
demonstrate
that
the
lawyer's
advice
concerning
potential
parole
eligibility
was
not
just
an
estimate
or
a
prediction,
if
he
were
in
the
situation
where
nobody
knew
what
mr.
hill
was
going
to
receive
when
he
walked
up
there
and
pled.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
he
could
have,
but
that
was
not
that
judge's
practice
and
counsel
advised
him
that
the
court
would
impose
whatever
the
recommendation
was.
that
is
correct,
under
the
arkansas
rules
of
criminal
procedure
the
judge
did
not
have
to
take
the
recommendation.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
it
depends
on
what
happened
before
and
if
it
was
a
negotiated
plea
where
the
judge
had
in
no
manner
whatsoever
participated
in
it,
and
if
counsel
had
not
advised
him
that
he
was
going
to
get
35
years
and
he
walked
up
there
and
the
judge
gave
him
50
years.
no,
he--
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
that's
the
question.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that's
the
question
presented.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
that's
correct.
i
only
mentioned
that
in
trying
to
show
that
we
have
possibly
misadvice
here,
and
that
we're
not
dealing
with
speculation.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
your
honor,
he
does
not
in
his
habeas
petition.
that
does
appear,
however,
in
the
objections
to
the
proposed
order
of
the
magistrate,
and
that's
at...
it
appears...
that
is
in
the
joint
appendix
at
46
and
47.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
no,
your
honor.
we
are
not
arguing
that.
i'm
not
arguing
that.
i
am
arguing
that
the
constitution
places
a
duty
on
the
attorney
to
advise
properly
when
he
does
that,
and
to
not
overlook
an
easily
accessible
published
statute
that
controls
parole
eligibility.
that's
what
we
argued.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
well,
if
you
take
it
as
it
is,
he
prepared
this
pro
se
petition.
he
is
not
a
lawyer.
he
is
not
a
scholar.
i
can
only...
i
came
in
after
the
magistrate
had
prepared
his
recommendations
for
the
district
court
and
then
i
filed
the
objections.
i
can
only,
at
this
point,
tell
the
court
what
his
testimony
would
be.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
not
on
the
record.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
again,
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
i
think
counsel
is
under
a
duty
to
inquire
about
prior
convictions
even
if
we
had
a
situation
here
where
petitioner
didn't
tell
him.
and
also,
let
me
address--
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
--well,
yes.
it
surprises
me
also.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
i
believe
he
could,
and
as
i
say
i
raised
that
in
the
objections.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
well,
that
would
be
my
error,
that
that
was
not
done.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
not
based
on
the
allegations
that
appear
in
the
original
petition.
i
think
that
is
correct.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
it
does
not
appear
at
page
8
and
9
in
his
allegations.
justice
stevens,
you
raised
a
question
a
moment
ago
concerning
what
the
court
said
about
the
defendant
being
required
to
serve
one-third.
i
would
like
to
clear
this
up.
there
is
some
misunderstanding
about
that.
whatever
the
circuit
court
judge
would
have
said
at
that
time
would
have
had
no
effect
on
the
potential
parole
eligibility
date
of
the
petitioner.
it
was
strictly
controlled
by
act
93
and
that
would
have
been
set
once
he
reached
the
department
of
corrections.
i
believe
that
that
was
probably
just
a
result
of
having
at
that
time
some
of
the
judges
continuing
to
do
that,
because
prior
to
the
enactment
of
act
93
if
one
was
under
the
age
of
21
and
he
would
be
immediately
parole
eligible
upon
being
sent
to
the
arkansas
department
of
corrections
as
a
first
offender,
and
the
judge
could
make
him
serve
one-third
less
good
time
by
saying
he
had
to
serve
a
third.
i
think
that
was
just
force
of
habit.
his
statement
that
he
was
to
do
one-third
would
have
had
no
effect
whatsoever
on
the
amount
of
time
that
he
was
to
serve.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
i
think
we
can
take
strickland
v.
washington
and
place
it
on
this
situation
and
ask,
first
of
all,
was
counsel
diligent
in
his
representation
of
the
defendant,
did
he
breach
some
duty
owed,
some
investigatory
duty
or
some
other
duty
owed
to
the
defendant,
and
we
would
ask
that
question
first.
petitioner
would
testify--
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
--that's
the
second
problem
with
the
test,
and
the
prejudice
here
would
be
that
he
would
not
have
entered
the
plea
except
for
this
advice
and
that
he
waived
his
right
to
go
to
trial.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
yes,
of
course.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
it
doesn't
appear.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
no,
i
don't--
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
--it's
possible
but
it
would
have
been
very
ill-advised
because
the
department
of
correction
would
have
caught
it
once
he
arrived
there.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
i
would
have
to
assume
that...
again,
we
would
speculate
here,
but
i
would
have
to
assume
that
the
prosecutor
was
aware
of
that
because
routinely
they
run
an
fbi
check
on
people
that
are
charged
with
serious
crime.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
yes,
it
certainly
is,
and
that's
one
of
the
first
things
that
your
client
wants
to
know
if
you
are
negotiating
a
plea.
so,
criminal
defense
attorneys
are,
and
certainly
should
be,
well
aware
of
the
defect
of
act
93
because
everybody
wants
to
know
that.
if
you're
going
to
negotiate
a
plea
they
want
to
know
when
is
the
earliest
possible
date
that
they
could
be
released.
i
think
we
could
show
at
a
hearing
by
putting
on
attorneys
that
this
kind
of
advice
is
extremely
important
during
the
course
of
representing
a
client
when
negotiating
a
plea.
i
think
that
we
could
prove
that
rather
easily
and
i
think
we
could
show
that
if
an
attorney
misadvises
in
this
manner
that
it
would
be
a
breach
of
a
duty
owed
a
client,
and
a
breach
of
diligence,
which
was,
i
think,
the
term
used
in
strickland
v.
washington.
we
are
asking
for
a
hearing
here
on
the
allegations
in
this
case
that
the
advice
by
counsel
was
not
speculative
in
nature
but
positive.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
that's
where
it
would
lodge,
at
that
point.
that's
what
you'd
have.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
that's
right,
it
would
simply
be
the
lawyer's
testimony
against
the
petitioner's.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
that's
correct,
in
that
you
would
have
to
show
that
he
wouldn't
have
entered
the
plea
unless--
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
--yes,
i
believe
so,
voluntariness
of
the
plea.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
yes,
i
think
so.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
initial
circuit
court
pleading
which
mr.
hill
filed,
which
he
styled
a
mr.
patterson's
death.
i
would
like
to
save
what
time
i
have
left
for
rebuttal,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
one
matter,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
regard
to
the
police
statement
form,
i
think
perhaps
we
need
to
talk
about
that
for
just
a
moment,
and
that's
a
space
where
you
have
a
blank
for
prior
convictions.
i
believe
the
purpose
of
that,
and
i
think
probably
what
happened
here,
is
to
enter
the
number
of
prior
convictions
that
the
individual
is
charged
under
the
habitual
offender
act.
i
don't
know
that
we
can
conclude
too
much
one
way
or
another
by
the
insertion
of
a
zero
there.
i
think
the
language--
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
--well,
we
don't
know
who
put
it
in.
i
would
imagine--
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
--i
would
imagine
counsel
did
that
and
then
presented
it
to
his
client.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
no,
no.
i
wouldn't
contest
that.
i
don't
know
actually
lifted
the
pencil
and
put
it
in
there.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
no,
i
do
not.
that's
all
i
have.
