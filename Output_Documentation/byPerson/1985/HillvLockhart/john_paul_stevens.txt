justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
one
other
factual
question.
you
indicated
that
the
basis
for
the
claim
that
he
would
not
have
entered
an
innocent
plea
if
he
had
known
the
true
facts,
is
in
your
objections
rather
than
in
the
habeas...
that's
apparently,
though,
that's
a
document
that
you
prepared?
that's
not
under
oath?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
there's
no
way
you
could
testify
to
this.
so,
is
it
proper
in
your
view
for
the
record
to
be
made
up
of,
in
effect,
factual
statements
in
a
brief
in
support
of
your
position?
that's
essentially
what
it
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
see,
one
other
fact
kind
of
puzzles
me
a
little
bit.
i
guess
for
act
93
to
apply
there
has
to
have
been
a
prior
felony
conviction,
is
that
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
clear
that
the
lawyer
who
is
row
deceased
was
advised
about
the
existence
of
the
prior
felony
conviction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
you
really
don't
know
if
the
lawyer
did
anything
but
tell
him,
according
to
his
best
knowledge,
what
the
law
was?
i'm
just
speculating,
because
in
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor
you
pointed
out
that
the
correction
office
checks
this
at
the
time
of
parole
eligibility?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
apparently
the
judge
thought
it
was
a
third.
it
doesn't
seem
to
be,
anybody
was
conscious
of
the
prior
conviction,
as
far
as
i
can
tell.
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
one
other
observation.
the
lawyer
who
is
now
deceased,
and
apparently
died
just
shortly
before
the
habeas
corpus
petition
was
filed,
apparently
if
he
was
a
public
defender,
i'm
amazed
he
wouldn't
know
about
act
93
but
i
could
understand
how
he
might
not
know
about
a
prior
conviction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
one
other...
i'm
sorry
to
take
so
much
of
your
time,
but
your
brief
refers
to
the
previous
florida
conviction.
where
in
the
record
do
we
know
exactly
what
the
florida
conviction
is
for
and
when
it
was
entered?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
does
not
appear?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
it
conceivable...
i'm
not
suggesting
this
happened,
that
the
defense
counsel
knew
about
the
florida
conviction
but
the
prosecutor
and
the
judge
didn't
and
he
thought
it
would
be
a
little
smarter
not
to
mention
it?
is
that
possible,
consistent
with
what
we
know
in
the
record?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
on
the
other
hand,
maybe
if
they'd
known...
i
don't
know
what
that
conviction
was.
it
might
have
been
something
that
might
have
made
the
prosecutor
ask
for
a
more
severe
sentence.
i
just
don't
know,
and
if
you
get
a
hearing
that
you've
asked
for,
the
testimony
will
be
presented
by
your
client
about
his
conversation
with
a
now
deceased
lawyer,
a
kind
of
unsatisfactory
state
of
affairs.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
it
your
suggestion
the
prosecutor
didn't
know
about
law
93
either?
if
he
knew
about
it...
i
find
it
rather
surprising
that
trained
lawyers
in
the
criminal...
in
prosecuting
criminal
cases
wouldn't
know
of
the
existence
of
that
statute.
isn't
that
fairly
common?
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
clark,
just
so
i
can
find
it
in
the
record,
the
plea
agreement
is
the
one
on
28
and
29
of
the
joint
appendix,
and
where
is
it
that
he
says
"no"
as
the
prior
convictions?
i
just
want
to
be
make
sure
i--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--would
you
just
tell
me
where
it
is
in
the
record
so
i
can
look
at...
is
it
28
and
29?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
where
is
the
part
about
the
"zero"?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
while
i've
got
it
on
my
mind,
does
the
record
tell
us
of
anywhere
that
we
might
have
missed
as
to
what
the
nature
of
the
florida
conviction
was,
when
it
occurred,
what
the
offense
was
and
so
forth?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
thank
you.
and
the
government
knew
that
when
this
plea
bargaining
was
going
on?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
one
other
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
must
confess,
this
keeps
troubling
me.
now,
your
police
statement
says,
"you
are
charged
with
a
felony
with
zero
prior
convictions.
"
and
you
have
told
us...
well,
maybe
i
shouldn't
ask
it
because
it's
off
the
record,
the
conviction
is
a
year
or
two
before.
this
was
after
four
months
after
the
plea
of
not
guilty,
there
was
a
pretrial
proceeding,
the
plea
was
changed
and
so
forth.
is
it
conceivable
that
neither
the
prosecutor
nor
defense
counsel
knew
this
fellow
had
spent
a
year
in
jail
right
before
this
incident?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
improbable.
to
whom
should
the
zero...
should
we
hold
that
against
your
opponent
or
against
your...
i
just
don't
know.
it
didn't
say
zero,
did
it?
