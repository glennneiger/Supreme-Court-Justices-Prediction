what
page
does
that
appear
at,
mr.
lassiter?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mine
only
goes
to
page--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--oh,
8
and
9.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
he
allege
that
he
had
told...
or
told
his
lawyer
all
of
his
factual
background
so
that
his
lawyer
would
know
that
act
93
was
applicable?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
wasn't
in
his
petition
for
habeas
that
we're
reviewing
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
i
understand
it,
mr.
lassiter,
your
client
here
does
not
make
any
claim
that
his
guilty
plea
was
not
intelligent
or
knowing.
it
is
a
challenge
to
the
assistance
of
counsel
he
received?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
by
reason
of
erroneous
advice
from
the
lawyer?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no
claim
of
erroneous
advice
from
the
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
in
the
habeas
petition,
mr.
lassiter,
did
your
client
make
the
contention
that
had
he
been
properly
advised
as
to
parole
eligibility
he
would
not
have
entered
into
this
plea
bargain?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
lassiter,
couldn't
your
client
have
amended
his
habeas
corpus
petition
if
at
the
time
you
were
objecting
to
the
magistrate's
report
it
appeared
to
you
that
it
had
not
said
enough
on
the
subject
of
whether
he
would
have
entered
this
plea
had
the
advice
been
correct?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it's
not
in
any
verified
way.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
certainly
can't
speak
for
him.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
we
really
don't
know
that
by
his
statement.
we
don't
know
that
he
would
not
have
entered
exactly
the
same
plea
even
if
he
had
received
the
correct
advice.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
not
based
on
any
other
statement
by
him
in
the
record,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
except
the
lawyer's
dead.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
state
ever
raise
in
its
defense
of
this
kind
of
provision
the
habeas
rules
that
allows
dismissal
of
habeas
where
the
delay
in
bringing
it
in
has
prejudiced
the
state's
ability
to
defend
against
the
claim?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
clark,
on
page
16
of
the
joint
appendix,
there
begins
what
apparently
is
the
state's
response
to
the
federal
habeas
petition,
and
which
appears
to
be
a
transcript
of
a
proceeding
before
the
district
court,
or
at
least
the
state's
version
of
what
happened
before
the
arkansas
trial
court.
on
page
18,
the
paragraph
towards
the
bottom
of
the
page,
after
the
indented
observation
where
the
court
says
something,
and
this
apparently
is
the
state's
paraphrase,
it
says,
"the
trial
judge
then
stated
that
petitioner
would
be
required
to
serve
at
least
one-third
of
his
sentence
before
becoming
eligible
for
parole.
"
now,
is
that
contested
in
any
way
that
you
know
of
by
opposing
counsel?
