i
think

justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
we
can
assume
that
the
testimony
of
the
prisoner,
who
is
not
here,
would
be
just
as
it
is
set
out
in
your
brief,
that
is,
that
he
was
misadvised?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
lawyers...
suppose
the
lawyer
says,
no,
that's
not
so,
contrary
testimony?
what
have
we
got
except
a
decision
on
credibility?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
speaking
of
the
general
rule
of
cases
that
you
would
make
out
of
this?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
attorney
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

anything
further,
counsel?

justice
