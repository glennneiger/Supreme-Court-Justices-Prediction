justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
the
record
reflect
that
mr.
hill
understood
when
he
entered
the
plea
that
had
he
gone
to
trial
he
would
serve
half
of
whatever
sentence
was
imposed?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
law
in
arkansas
at
the
time
was
that
had
he
gone
to
trial
he
would
serve
half
of
any
sentence
resulting
from
a
conviction?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
mind
explaining
what
the
law
in
arkansas
is
on
alleging
and
proving
prior
convictions
to
enhance
or
determine
parole
eligibility?
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
the
state
is
not
required
to
allege
and
prove
the
prior
conviction.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
a
determination
to
be
made
by
the
parole
board
after
the
conviction
and
the
sentence,
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
under
this
plea
the
highest
potential
sentence
that
could
have
been
imposed
was
up
to
50
years,
is
that
correct?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
had
the
judge
given
the
maximum
sentence,
then
this
mr.
hill
would
not
have
had
to
serve
longer
than
the
time
he
is
objecting
to
here,
isn't
that
true?
a
third
of
50
would
be
how
much?
and
how
is
he
prejudiced,
then,
by
the
fact
that
he
got
a
lesser
sentence
that
he
has
to
serve
half
of,
which
wouldn't
be
any
more
than
had
he
received
the
maximum
sentence
and
served
a
third
of
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but,
now,
when
the
judge
asked
him
whether
any
promises
were
made
to
him
to
get
him
to
enter
the
plea
agreement,
his
response
was,
no,
nothing
that
didn't
appear
on
the
agreement.
are
you
relying
for
purposes
of
this
case
on
a
promise
that
he
would
get
35
years
maximum,
or
not?
because,
that
would
be
in
conflict
with
the
face
of
the
plea
agreement
and
i
hadn't
understood
that
you
had
raised
that
and
were
relying
on
that.
i
understood
that
you
were
relying
only
on
an
allegation
that
the
lawyer
had
told
him
something
about
his
parole
eligibility
date,
not
that
he
had
been
promised
that
he
would
get
a
35-year
sentence,
maximum.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
lassiter,
you
keep
changing
the
question.
i'm
looking
at
the
question
presented
for
review
to
this
court,
and
i
read
it
as
saying
that
he
alleges
that
the
attorney
misadvised
him
as
to
his
potential
parole
eligibility
date,
not
that
he
had
been
promised
that
he
would
get
a
35-year
maximum
sentence.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
you
are
arguing
something
now
that
i
didn't
understand
was
encompassed
in
this
question
at
all.
i
understood
you
were
basing
it
on
the
allegation
that
the
lawyer
said,
you're
going
to
be
eligible
for
parole
after
serving
a
third
of
your
sentence,
whatever
it
is.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
we
don't
have
to
consider
this
discussion
this
morning
about
a
promise
of
35
years
maximum,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
lassiter,
assuming
that
the
court
were
to
feel
that
the
allegation
somehow
rose
to
the
level
that
a
hearing
would
be
appropriate,
what
standard
should
be
applied
to
determine,
what
legal
standard
should
be
applied
to
determine
the
ineffectiveness
of
assistance
claim
in
a
plea
bargain
situation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
perhaps
ask
first
whether
there
was
prejudice.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
the
facts
appear
that
he
had
made
such--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
there
any
circumstances,
in
your
view,
when
an
attorney's
erroneous
legal
advice
on
parole
eligibility
could
rise
to
the
level
of
establishing
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
counsel,
if
a
sufficient
allegation
were
made
to
justify
holding
the
hearing,
what
standard
do
you
think
should
be
applied,
legal
standard,
to
determine
the
issue?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
agree
it
should
be
some
adaptation
of
the
strickland
standard?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
should
the
state
do
if
it
knows
that
that's
wrong,
and
the
state
is
a
party
to
the
plea
agreement?
what
if
the
prosecutor
had
the
rap
sheet
right
in
front
of
him
and
knew
that
there
was
a
prior
conviction,
read
the
agreement,
knew
the
defendant
had
entered
the
wrong
information?
