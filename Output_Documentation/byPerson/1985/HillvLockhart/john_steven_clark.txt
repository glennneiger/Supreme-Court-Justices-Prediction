mr.
john
steven
clark
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
facts
in
this
case
are
simple
and
direct.
it
is
true
that
mr.
hill
was
charged
with
murder
one
and
theft
of
property.
it
is
also
important
for
this
record
to
remember
that
on
april
6th,
1979,
the
defendant
in
this
case
entered
into
a
plea
agreement.
in
that
specific
agreement,
in
which
the
plaintiff
waived,
knowingly
waived
and
informedly
waived
his
constitutional
rights
to
a
trial,
to
confront
witnesses,
to
testify
in
his
own
behalf,
that
document,
executed
by
the
defendant
with
the
help
of
his
counsel,
in
fact
is
a
form
which
they
complete
together.
on
that
form
the
defendant
entered
"zero"
as
to
prior
convictions,
without...
with
assistance
of
counsel.
that
same
day
the
defendant
and
his
counsel
appeared
before
the
trial
court
in
order
to
enter
his
voluntary
plea
of
guilty.
the
court
inquired
as
to
the
terms
of
the
plea
agreement,
specifically
if
it
was
accurate,
specifically
if
the
defendant
had
relied
upon
any
promises,
threats
or
other
offers
from
the
prosecution,
specifically
as
to
whether
the
defendant
was
satisfied
with
representation
of
counsel,
and
specifically
if
the
defendant
had
any
other
comments
that
he
would
like
to
offer
to
the
court.
the
defendant
said
no.
i
submit
to
you
that
the
central
issue
in
this
case--
mr.
john
steven
clark
--your
honor,
on
the
plea
agreement,
it
is
a
form
and
there
is
a
space
which
says
"prior
convictions".
there
is
a
space.
mr.
john
steven
clark
yes,
sir,
it
is.
it
is
not--
mr.
john
steven
clark
--in
the
second
paragraph,
in
the
first
sentence,
your
honor:
"you
are
charged
with
a
felony
and
with
zero
prior
convictions.
"
that
"zero"
is
not
underscored
but
it
was
a
blank
on
the
plea
agreement
itself,
your
honor.
mr.
john
steven
clark
the
simple
issue,
i
submit
to
the
court
in
this
case,
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
finding
that
the
petitioner
was
not
constitutionally
entitled
to
an
evidentiary
hearing
in
a
collateral
attack
of
his
voluntary
guilty
plea.
i
submit
to
you,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
make
error.
this
court
on
several
occasions
has
emphasized
the
validity
and
importance
of
plea
bargaining
process,
and
likewise
stated,
for
the
plea
bargaining
process
to
work,
a
guilty
plea
must
be
accorded
a
great
measure
of
finality.
in
this
instance,
the
truthfulness
and
the
accuracy
of
this
guilty
plea,
this
voluntary
guilty
plea,
is
evidenced
by
the
record.
i
submit
that
generally
speaking,
parole
eligibility
is
not
a
direct
but
rather
a
collateral
consequence
of
any
guilty
plea.
it
is
unnecessary
to
advise
the
defendant
who
desires
to
plead
guilty
as
to
parole
eligibility,
and
the
fact
that
the
defendant
is
misadvised
does
not
in
itself
per
se
negate
that
voluntary
plea.
in
fact,
we
have
found
in
the
federal
criminal
rules
of
procedure,
rule
11,
that
the...
we
have
stated
in
the
comments
that
not
only
is
the
question
as
advise
as
to
when
someone
might
make
parole
or
be
parole
eligible,
but
whether,
and
that
is
true
in
arkansas
as
there
is
no
requirement
to
advise
as
to
parole
eligibility.
in
the
case
at
bar
the
record
clearly
demonstrates,
i
submit
to
this
court,
that
parole
eligibility
was
not
a
part
of
the
plea
bargain,
and
that
this
petitioner
was
not
wrongfully
induced
to
plead
guilty
based
on
some
assertion.
i
would
further
submit
to
this
court
that
a
better
rule
of
law
is
that
even
if
the
defendant
was
ill-advised
or
misinformed
as
to
what
the
precise
eligibility
is
to
be
for
parole,
that
fact
alone
does
not
take
away
from
guilt
or
the
desire
to
enter
a
plea
of
guilty.
there
must
be
some
demonstration
of
prejudice.
mr.
john
steven
clark
your
honor,
the
record
does
not.
the
offense,
however,
was
aggravated
assault
and
breaking
and
entering,
of
which
he
was
convicted
in
'77
and
served
until
'78,
at
which
time
he
came
to
arkansas.
mr.
john
steven
clark
your
honor,
i
do
not
know
that
the
government
knew
that.
mr.
john
steven
clark
your
honor,
i
have
not,
but
in
this
instance
the
rap
sheet
that
we
had
came
from
the
arkansas
state
police.
whether
it
was
complete
or
not,
i
do
not
know.
the
allegation...
the
need
for
finality
in
the
criminal
justice
process
is
imperative,
i
submit
to
you,
particularly
when
those
challenges
come
from
some
collateral
attack
some
years
later,
and
are
only
allegations
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
this
allegation
has
become
a
very
common
vehicle
for
those
incarcerated
to
seek
relief
by
simply
placing
the
system
and
their
attorney
on
trial
by
realizing
their
petition
as
petitioner,
at
worst
cases
merely
the
status
quo,
"i
voluntarily
entered
my
plea
of
guilty,
i
made
an
informed
decision
to
waive
my
rights
and
was
sentenced,
but
maybe
i
can
receive
a
more
favorable
sentence
later
if
i
will
file
this
collateral
attack
on
that
sentence.
"
in
particular,
i
submit
to
you
today,
what
troubles
me
about
this
case
is
that
the
so-called
inducement
to
plea
asserted
by
petitioner
is
actually
only
that
individual's
unilateral
expectation,
an
expectation
which
rarely,
as
in
this
case,
if
ever
can
be
tested
by
any
objective
standard,
and
which
submits
virtually
every
guilty
plea,
and
in
arkansas
there
are
some
10,000
entered
each
year,
to
attack
collaterally
at
any
time
when
the
defendant
upon
incarceration
determines
that
his
expectations,
whatever
they
may
have
been,
that
being
denied
a
right
to
vote
would
not
have
occurred,
or
being
denied
the
right
to
hold
a
hunting
licence
or
a
barber's
licence
would
not
have
occurred.
if
he
asserts,
then,
that
because
of
his
expectation
he
can
challenge,
collaterally
challenge
the
voluntariness
of
that
plea
and
be
entitled
to
an
evidentiary
hearing
because
of
his
own
individual
expectations,
and
this
instance
has
been
stated
before
clearly,
a
competent
and
dedicated
and
respected
public
defender,
now
deceased,
cannot
be
heard
as
to
what
in
fact
did
go
on
in
terms
of
contradicting
or
supporting
the
petitioner's
case.
but
in
this
instance
we
have
a
record
that
demonstrates
that
that
competent
and
dedicated
public
defender,
who
in
my
opinion
did
know
the
law,
saw
from
the
defendant
an
assertion
that
there
were
zero
prior
convictions.
mr.
john
steven
clark
no
your
honor,
it
is
not
contested
by
opposing
counsel.
i
would
further
submit
to
this
court
that
though
i
recognize
there
will
be
those
who
would
appear
at
this
bar
and
argue
that
parole
was
the
only
factor
to
be
considered
by
the
defendant
in
pleading
guilty,
"when
do
i
get
out",
if
you
will,
that
a
better
rule
of
law
and
policy
requires
that
you
take
into
consideration
two
very
important
factors,
and
those
are
simply
these,
and
must
be
remembered
and
balanced
against
that
assertion:
the
multiplicity
of
imponderables
that
can
affect
parole,
not
the
least
of
which
is
the
conduct
of
the
defendant
or
changes
in
regulations
or
policy,
perhaps,
by
policy
making
bodies.
i
submit
that
as
in
this
case,
when
this
petitioner
pled
guilty
voluntarily
and
in
an
informed
way
waived
those
constitutional
rights
that
are
protected,
and
was
sentenced
to
35
years
which
was
the
agreed
recommended
sentence,
he
is
not,
and
i
repeat
not,
constitutionally
entitled
to
serve
anything
less
than
35
years.
mr.
john
steven
clark
your
honor,
i
have
considered
that
question
carefully.
it
would
be
my
opinion
that
perhaps
you
could
make
the
case
where
the
erroneous
advice,
or
such
an
inducement
to
the
plea,
and
on
the
record
the
defendant
indicated
that
this
was
a
material
fact,
to
the
court,
that,
"i
wanted
this
court
to
consider.
"
and
therefore
if
the
court
did
not
consider
it
you
might
make
such
a
case.
but,
in
this
instance
the
record
is
devoid
of
such
an
assertion.
mr.
john
steven
clark
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
it
would
have
to
undermine
the
voluntariness,
as
i
have
determined
that
voluntariness
to
be,
the
informed
waiver
of
those
rights.
mr.
john
steven
clark
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
in
that
instance,
if
in
fact
because
of
that
representation,
and
it
was
an
inducement
to
that
plea,
the
defendant
thinking
he
would
make
parole
when
in
fact
he
could
not,
you
may
have
prejudice
that
attaches
that
allows
such
a
hearing.
mr.
john
steven
clark
it
is
my
submission,
your
honor,
that
misadvice
does
not
amount
to
a
constitutional
violation
unless
prejudice
attaches
in
some
form,
that
is,
there
was
no
voluntary
waiver.
mr.
john
steven
clark
the
facts
of
your
example,
your
honor,
is
that
there
would
be
no
parole
but
he
was
advised
there
could
be
parole,
is
that
correct?
perhaps
in
that
instance
he
is
entitled
to
a
hearing,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
steven
clark
yes,
your
honor.
in
summary
to
this
court,
i
would
submit
this,
that
the
policy
as
i
have
stated,
which
is
a
better
policy,
is
one
in
which
the
defendant
is
not
constitutionally
entitled
to
information
as
to
parole
eligibility,
and
that
the
need
for
finality
of
judgment
should
continue
to
be
afforded
great
weight
and
a
measure
of
finality
when
a
voluntary
plea
is
challenged
on
a
collateral
attack
in
terms
of
petition
for
habeas
corpus.
for
all
those
reasons,
i
submit
to
you
that
the
decision
below
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
john
steven
clark
your
honor,
i
think
that
standard
would
be--
mr.
john
steven
clark
--your
honor,
it
should
be
some
adaptation
of
the
strickland
standard,
not
necessarily
the
strickland
standard
as
to
an
adversarial
proceeding.
i
think
that
standard
is
that
in
this
instance
the
defendant
was
induced
to
make
a
decision.
if
it
shows
it
was
not
an
informed
waiver
because
of
facts
upon
which
he
relied,
either
demonstrated
by
the
prosecution
or
by
the
defendant
or
by
the
court,
then
it's
not
the
same
test
as
strickland
as
to
that
adversarial
nature
of
the
full
litigation
in
terms
of
a
plea
of
not
guilty.
mr.
john
steven
clark
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
steven
clark
your
honor,
it's
possible
although
i
don't
know
that
it's
probable.
mr.
john
steven
clark
your
honor,
he
entered
a
zero
into
the
form.
the
form
has
a
"prior
convictions"
blank.
there
was
a
zero
actually,
physically
written
in.
mr.
john
steven
clark
by
the
defendant
and
the
defendant's
counsel,
prepared
by
them.
thank
you.
mr.
john
steven
clark
i
think
the
prosecutor
as
an
officer
of
the
court
would
have
the
duty
to
inform
the
court
what
the
correct
information
was.
thank
you.
