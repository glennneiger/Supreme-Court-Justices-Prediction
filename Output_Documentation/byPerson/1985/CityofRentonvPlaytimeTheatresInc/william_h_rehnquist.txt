in

justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--how
many
square
miles
in
the
city?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
520
acres
would
be
somewhat
less
than
a
square
mile.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
detroit
and
seattle
were
doing
it
two
different
ways;
detroit
by
dispersal
and
seattle
by
concentration?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
burns--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
prettyman
said
that
the
city
of
renton
was
entitled
to
rely
on
the
city
of
seattle's
experience,
and
he
said
that
a
seattle
study
had
shown
that
adult
theatres
in
residential
areas
produced,
you
know,
transience,
crime,
that
sort
of
thing.
do
you
say
there
was
no
such
seattle
experience,
or
that
the
city
of
renton
might
not
rely
on
that
seattle
experience
if
that
was
seattle's
experience?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
first
of
all,
do
you
contend
that
the
city
of
renton
was
not
entitled
to
rely
in
drafting
its
ordinance
on
whatever
experience
the
city
of
seattle
might
have
had?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
that
so?
i
mean,
if
a
seattle
study
shows
particular
facts
flowing
from
the
location
of
an
adult
theatre,
why
can't
the
city
of
renton
say,
we
don't
like
these
facts
to
exist
in
certain
zones
in
our
city.
we're
going
to
go
at
it
differently
than
seattle,
however.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it's
sufficiently
risky
so
that
the
constitution
forbids
renton
from
doing
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
such
an
unlikely
location
for,
say,
a
drive-in
theatre?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
thought
we
took
it
as
stipulated
that
an
adult
theatre
was
permissible.
are
you
saying
that
an
adult
self-contained
theatre
would
be
admissible
but
perhaps
a
drive-in
theatre
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
say
it's
an
industrial
wasteland.
do
you
insist
that
there
be
a
theatre
building
in
existence
for
you
to
come
in
and
rent?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
do
you
mean
by
an
available
location?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
would
that
entitle
a
theatre
to
locate
out
of
a
commercial
zone
and
in
a
residential
zone
because
no
one
in
a
commercial
zone
would
sell
them
theatre
space?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
wouldn't
it
under
your
reasoning?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
about
the
transience
and
crime
from
the
seattle
study?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
did
the
city
of...
did
the
decision
of
your
state
supreme
court
summarize
findings
that
had
been
made
in
seattle?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
on
earth
shouldn't
they
be
able
to
look
at
the
supreme
court
opinion
as
a
secondary
source?
are
you
going
to
require
the
best
evidence
rule?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
that's
a
nice
sounding
phrase,
but
how
would
you
define
empirical
evidence
that's
of
a
compelling
nature,
as
opposed
to
just
garden
variety
evidence?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
provide
them
with
bus
tickets?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
provide
them
with
bus
tickets?
