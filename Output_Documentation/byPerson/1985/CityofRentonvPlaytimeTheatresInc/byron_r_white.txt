justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
isn't,
it
can't
be
literally
true
that
it's
unrelated,
because
at
least
in
order
to
avoid
the
secondary
effects,
you
are
forbidding,
you
are
forbidding
these
constitutionally
protected
kinds
of
speech
to...
you're
making
them
move.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
only
because
they're
a
speech
of
a
certain
kind
that
you're
making
them
move.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
only
reason
the
secondary
effects
will
occur
is
because
of
the
nature
of
the
speech.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right--
justice
byron
r.
white
--yes,
of
course
it
is,
but
that
shouldn't
make
any
difference
to
your
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
said
there
were
three
questions,
three
issues
in
the
case.
have
you
discussed
them
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
--the
other
two?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
are
the
other
two?
justice
byron
r.
white
okay,
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
did--
justice
byron
r.
white
--what
are
the
confines
of
young
on
the
standard
you
resort
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i,
could
i
ask,
suppose
that
in
this
record
there
was
evidence
of
the
likely
effect
of
adult
theatres
being
too
close
to
residential
districts.
and
suppose
the
evidence
was
such
that
even
you
would
agree
that
there's
a
pretty
good
showing
that
that
would
have
these
harmful
consequences.
but
then
the
rest
of
the
facts
here
are
the
same.
would
you
say
that
renton
then
could
not
exclude
these
adult
theatres
from
these
locations?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
even
though
the
only
place
these,
even
though
the
only
place
these
theatres
could
then
go
is
to
this
area
that
you
say
is
wholly
unsatisfactory?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
my
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
even
though
this
area
that
the
adult
theatres
would
have
to
move
to
is
as
unsatisfactory
as
you
say
it
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
what
i'm
asking.
the
other
facts
in
this
case
are
the
same
except
that
there's
adequate
proof
of,
of
harm,
of
potential
harm
to
the
residential
areas.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though,
even
though
other
sites
may
not
be
available?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
can
a
commercial
property
be
located
in
an
industrial
area?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
it's
not
forbidden.
it's
not
forbidden
even--
justice
byron
r.
white
--though,
so
the
answer
is
commercial
establishments
may
be
located
in
an
industrial
area.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
would
not
be
against
the
zoning
law
for
this
theatre
to
be
in
the
industrial
area.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
mean
unavailable?
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
again,
if
there
had
been
adequate
proof
or
some
grounds
for
believing,
a
decent
grounds
for
believing
there
would
be
danger
to
residential
areas,
this
unavailability
would
make
no
difference?
