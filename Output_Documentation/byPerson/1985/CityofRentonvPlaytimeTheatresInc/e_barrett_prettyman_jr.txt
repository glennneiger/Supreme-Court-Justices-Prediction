mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case,
which
comes
here
from
the
ninth
circuit,
involves
an
attempt
by
a
small
city
in
the
state
of
washington
to
zone
adult
theatres
away
from
residence,
churches,
parks
and
schools.
you'll
recall
that
in
1976
in
young
<v@l>
[=
v.]
american
min
theatres,
you
upheld
a
detroit
ordinance
which
treated
adult
theatres
differently
than
general
fare
theatres
because
of
the
adverse
secondary
effects
caused
by
the
adult
theatres.
the
city
of
renton's
attempt
began
more
than
a
year
before
any
adult
theatres
had
actually
come
into
the
city,
but
the
secondary
effects
of
these
theatres
had
been
perceived
nearby
in
the
state
of
washington,
in
the
city
of
tacoma,
in
the
city
of
spokane,
and
just
a
mile
to
the
north
in
the
city
of
seattle,
which
had
had
its
own
case
which
had
gone
through
the
state
supreme
court.
this
court
had
denied
certiorari.
the
zoning
ordinance
in
that
case
has
been
upheld.
renton
wanted
to
deal
with
this
problem
before
it
became
a
problem.
it
wanted
to
obviate
these
secondary
effects
before
they
ever
got
into
the
city,
because,
quite
candidly,
some
other
cities,
as
a
result
of
young,
had
attempted
to
deal
with
specific
situations
in
front
of
them,
and
those
ordinances
had
been
struck
down.
so,
renton,
during
the
following
year,
the
city
council,
through
its
committees
studied
what
had
happened
in
other
cities.
it
looked
at
the
opinions
that
had
come
down
in
other
places;
not
just
in
the
state
of
washington
but
in
other
cities
as
well.
it
held
a
number
of
meetings.
these
were
public
meetings.
in
some
of
them
it
listened
to
citizens
voice
their
concerns.
these
citizens
were
not
only
from
renton
but
from
some
from
nearby
cities.
and
it
finally
passed
one
of
three
ordinances.
the
first
ordinance
prohibited
the
location
of
adult
theatres
within
1,000
feet
of
residences,
of
single
or
multi-family
dwellings,
churches,
or
parks.
as
to
schools,
this
first
ordinance
provided
that
adult
theatres
could
not
be
located
within
a
mile
of
these
schools.
that
was
later
reduced
in
the
second
ordinance
to
1,000
feet.
after
the
first
ordinance
was
passed,
appellees,
whom
i'll
call
playtime,
brought
a
suit
in
renton
seeking
declaratory
judgment
and
an
injunction
based
on
their
first
amendment
rights
anti
equal
protection.
and
they
shortly
thereafter,
virtually
within
the
same
week,
brought
two
existing
general
fare
theatres
in
downtown
renton,
in
one
of
which
they
said
they
intended
to
show
adult
fare
on
a
regular
basis.
the
result
of
our
second
ordinance,
when
you
drew
circles
around
the
areas
that
these
theatres
could
not
locate
next
to,
in
effect
created
a
permissive
or
set-aside
zone
in
the
city
of
renton
which
consisted
of
some
520
acres.
this
is,
incidentally,
a
larger
area
than
the
entire
commercial
area
of
the
city
of
renton,
and
it
is
more
acres
than
all
of
the
multi-family
residences
in
the
city
of
renton.
the
district
court
said
that--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--pardon
me?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
it's
15.3
square
miles,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it's
enough
for
over
400
theatres.
that's
undisputed
by
the
other
side,
your
honor,
including
parking
lots.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
the
city's
real
concern
was
with
their
being
too
close
to
the
prohibited
areas,
and
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
record
does
not
reflect
a
concern
as
to
precise--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--except
to
this
extent,
your
honor.
mr.
clemmons,
our
policy
development
director,
who
had
been
with
the
city
for
a
number
of
years
and
was
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
city,
was
constantly
advising
these
committees
of
the
city
council,
and
consequently
i
assume
that
he
knew
and
was
advising
them
about
the
nature
of
the
area
that
was
left
over.
the
city...
renton
is
a
small
enough
city
so
that
the
city
council
is,
i
think,
thoroughly
familiar--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--let
me
put
it
this
way,
justice
o'connor.
i
think
that
if
the
set-aside
zone
was
entirely,
totally
unsuitable
to
the
extent
of
being
unavailable...
if
i
can
use
an
extreme
example,
if
it
was
an
island
with
no
bridge
that
you
had
to
swim
to
to
get
to
your
adult
theatre,
i
think
that
would
be
very
quite
relevant.
but
i
think
where
the
ninth
circuit
went
wrong
was
in
saying
that
just
because
this
area
is
largely
undeveloped
or
is
in
the
state
of
development
and
has
commercial
ventures
on
it
now,
that--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--it
seems--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--it
seems
to
me
that
what
you
look
at
is
what
results.
you
don't
look
at
whether,
you
look
at
whether
the
city
had
a
legitimate
right
to
do
what
it
did;
then
you
turn
around
and
look,
well,
what
is
the
result?
do
you
have
a
schad
situation
where
they
had,
in
effect,
excluded
them
from
the
city?
or
do
you
have
an
area
for
over
400
theatres
that's
developing,
in
the
state
of
development
that
they
can
easily
go
into?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
uh,
only
part--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--oh,
yes.
oh,
absolutely,
your
honor.
i
think
what
you
may
be
thinking
of
is
the
other
side
sent
a
gentleman
out
to
the
zone,
and
he
could
find
only
three
people
who
said
that,
in
effect,
they'd
be
willing
to
sell,
but
there
are
far
more
than
three
sites
available.
over
half
of
this
land
is
undeveloped.
it
is
just
sitting
there.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
absolutely
not.
there
were
no
theatres
there.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
your
honor,
if
i
can
show
this
to
you
visually,
if
i
may
impose
upon
you
to
look
at
page
141a
of
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
141a.
it
is
called
exhibit
u.
you
will
see
the
set-aside
zone
in
grey,
here,
in
the
heaviest
color,
and
you
will
see
running
east-west,
just
north
of
there,
a
very
heavy
line
which
is
route
405.
if
you
follow
route
405
up
north
where
it
crosses
the
light
east-west
line
at
the
top,
or
where
the
renton
and
roxy
theatres
were
located,
those
were
the
two
that
they
bought.
those
are
only,
really,
probably
ten
minutes
from
the
northern
edge
of
the
permissive
zone.
there
is
another
theatre
just
south
of
that,
between
the
set-aside
zone
and
the
renton
and
roxy
theatres,
and
they're
the
only
three
sets
of
theatres
in
the
city
of
renton.
the
renton
cinema
actually
has
three
screens,
so
there
are
five
screens
altogether,
but
there
are
only
three
theatres
in
the
city
at
the
present
time.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
think
you--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--yes,
well,
i
think
clearly
if
drive-in
movies
were
going
to
show
adult
films
that
this
would
be
an
excellent
place
for
them
to
be,
because
this
is
extremely
accessible.
you're
got
entrances
on
most
sides
of
this
set-aside
zone.
you've
got
highways
nearby,
and
i
think,
justice
marshall,
if
you
want
any
indication
of
how
far
people
will
go
to
see
these
movies,
let
me
give
you
the
example
of
point
roberts,
which
is
a
small
city.
it
looks
like
it
really
ought
to
be
part
of
canada.
it's
kind
of
hanging
off
the
edge,
there,
but
it's
actually
part
of
the
state
of
washington.
it
has
a
year-round
population
of
250
people,
and
you
know
how
many
patrons
they
have
a
week
at
that
adult
theatre
which
is
also
owned
by
playtime?
fifteen
hundred.
and
where
do
they
come
from?
they
come
primarily
from
vancouver,
which
is
36
miles
away.
now,
we're
talking
about
a
set-aside
zone
in
renton
which
is
just
a
matter
of
a
few
miles
from
the
outer
edges
of
the
city.
you're
talking
about,
from
the
most
northern
edge
of
the
city,
you're
probably
talking
twenty
minutes,
maybe
ten,
fifteen
minutes
from
downtown.
and
here
is
a
zone
which
is
easily
accessible,
as
the
district
court
held.
it's
criss-crossed
by
streets
and
highways.
it
is
now
well
lit,
and
it
is,
in
my
view...
i
was
just
out
there
ten
years
ago.
it
seems
to
be
sort
of
the
coming
area
of
the
city;
the
next
area,
if
you
will,
that's
going
to
be,
that's
going
to
be
built
up.
it
seems
to
us
that
there
are
three,
basically
three
issues
here,
and
that
the
ninth
circuit
was
wrong
on
all
three.
the
first
issue
really
relates
to
whether
we
are
allowed,
we're
allowed
to
look
at
the
experience
of
other
cities
in
passing
this
ordinance,
and
the
ninth
circuit
said
that
we
could
not.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
mast
obvious
example
is
the
city
of
seattle,
where
seattle
was...
seattle
had
13
adult
theatres.
ten
of
them
were
downtown;
three
were
out
in
residential
areas,
and
they
were
the
three
that
they
were
concerned
about.
one
of
them
was
all
by
itself
in
a
residential
area,
and
seattle
passed
its
zoning
ordinance
in
order
to
get
all
of
them
into
a
kind
of
bad
area
right
downtown
rather
than
out
near
residences,
and
so
we
were
looking
at
that
example.
i
might
also
say
in
regard
to
young--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--yes,
ma'am,
they
did.
they
showed
that,
that
they
caused
transience
to
come
in.
they
showed
an
increase
of
crime,
and
they
showed,
in
effect,
that
property
values
would
go
down.
one
of
the
things
that
i
think
people
forget
when
they
look
at
young
is
everybody
concentrates
on
the
fact
that
the
prescription
was
1,000
feet
from
any
two
other
adult
uses.
what
they
forget
is
that
in
the
young
ordinance,
it
also
prohibited
adult
theatres
within
500
feet
of
residences,
and
that
particular
prescription
wasn't
even
fought
in
this
court,
i
assume,
because
it
was
assumed
to
be,
assumed
to
be
constitutional.
but
that
was
part
of
the
young
ordinance,
and
we
had
that
to
look
to,
and
therefore
ours
is
really
a
tighter
and
more
permissive
ordinance
in
that
respect
than--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--yes,
that's
exactly
right.
and
different
cities
have
used
different
methods.
this
court
said
in
young
that
it
made
no
difference,
really.
in
fact,
you
approved
both
methods,
both
the
dispersal
method
and
the
concentration
method.
you
specifically
said
that
in
young,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
you
even
said
that
that
was
true
as
to
theatres
in
general,
that
they
could
be
dispersed;
that,
in
other
words,
the
way
that
you
deal
with
the
problem
is
constitutionally
irrelevant.
so,
our
point
in
regard
to
whether
we
could
rely
on
the
experience
of
other
cities
is
very
simple,
and
that
is,
what
was
there
for
us
to
study?
they
weren't
in
there
yet.
we
weren't
dealing
with
one
theater
or
twenty
theatres.
what
we
were
saying,
in
effective
land
use
planning,
which
is
what
zoning
is
all
about,
we
were
saying
when
they
come
in
here,
whether
it
be
one
or
forty,
we're
going
to
want
them
away
from
our
residences
and
churches
and
parks
and
schools.
let
me
tell
you
that
renton
is
an
interesting
town
in
this
respect,
because
it
doesn't
have
this
commercial
area
over
here
and
the
churches
over
here
and
the
residential
area
over
here.
it's
all
mixed
up
together,
so
that
right
downtown,
right
in
the
same
block
with
these
two
theatres
that
playtime
has
bought,
are
residences,
and
two
little
churches
as
a
matter
of
fact.
the
record
does
not
show
that,
let
me
make
clear.
that
is
outside
the
record,
but
it
just
happens
to
be
true,
and
i
am
sure
mr.
burns
will
not
dispute
it.
but
in
the
same
block
as
these
two
theatres
are
residences
and
two
little
churches,
and
with
the
high
school
just
two
blocks
away.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
certainly.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
oh,
i
don't
think
that,
sir,
that's
there's
any
question
that
they
held
it
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
they--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--well,
that
was
rather
strange.
the
reason,
if
they
are
sending
it
back,
they
are
sending
it
back
because
they
thought
that
a
motivating
factor,
at
least
there
was
an
inference
that
a
motivating
factor
might
be
that
we
were
trying
to
suppress
first
amendment
rights.
our
response
to
that
is
twofold.
first
of
all,
your
honor,
why
are
you
looking
at
intent
or
motive
in
a
case
where
you
have
a
substantial
government
interest
and
only
an
incidental
restriction
on
first
amendment
rights.
you
didn't
do
it
in
young,
although
there
was
a
suggestion
there
that
there
might
have
been
a
bad
motive.
you
refused
to
do
it
in
o'brien,
even
though
that
was
clearly
argued
that
they
had
a
bad
motive,
so
you
never
get
to--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--oh,
i
think
that's
quite
clear,
your
honor,
that
they
have
said
that
it
is,
that
it
violates
the
first
amendment.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
absolutely.
passing
on,
then,
let
me
simply
say
in
regard
to,
i
believe
i
have
mentioned
that
the
second
issue
relates
to
the
set-aside
zone
itself;
the
nature
and
content
of
this
zone.
and
let
me
just
read
you
what
the
district
court
said
about
that,
because
i
think
it
goes
directly
to
this
question.
this
consists
of
acreage
in
all
stages
of
development
from
raw
land
to
developed,
industrial,
warehouse,
office
and
shopping
space.
it
is
criss-crossed
by
freeways,
highways
and
roads.
i
think
that
is
the
nature
of
this
zone,
and
i
think
that
that
should
be
perfectly
permissible
for
first
amendment
purposes.
he
also--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--justice
o'connor,
let
me
say
this
as
to
that.
as
you
know,
the
plurality
in
young
declined
to
do
that,
and
put
the
secondary,
these
adult
theatres
in
a
kind
of
secondary
status,
sort
of
on
a
level,
if
you
will,
with
commercial...
and
that
justice
powell,
who
wrote
the
opinion
that
made
the
difference
in
the
result,
refused
to
do
that
and
adopted
the
o'brien
test.
quite
candidly,
the
reason
that
we
have
not
taken
a
position
is
that
it
seems
to
us
that
it
really
doesn't
make
any
difference
in
the
result
in
our
case
which
way
you
go,
because
the
result
is
the
same.
if
you
asking
me,
however,
what
i
would
like
to
see?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
all
right.
i
thought
you
were,
justice
o'connor.
i
would
say,
quite
candidly,
that
it
seems
to
us
that
the
plurality
view
more
neatly
fits
the
particular
problem
at
hand.
o'brien,
after
all,
was
a
criminal
case,
and
the
four-part
test
developed
in
that
case,
it
has
been
used
in
a
variety
of
circumstances,
and
we
are
happy
with
it
if
you
want
to
apply
it
here.
but
it
seems
to
us
that
the
plurality
really
goes
directly
to
secondary
theatres.
it
talks
about
the
fact
that
these
are
showing
films
which,
in
a
separate
case
in
the
state
court
right
here
in
renton
in
an
abatement
action,
have
been
held
to
meet
the
miller
test;
and,
therefore,
there's
a
real
question
in
our
minds
as
to
whether,
as
justice
stevens
said,
you're
going
to
march
your
sons
and
daughters
off
to
war
to
protect
these
kinds
of
films.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
these
are
films
that
perhaps
because
of
the
secondary
effects
caused
by
the
theatres
that
they're
played
in,
do
not
deserve
the
high
degree
of
protection
that
other
types
of
speech
do.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
correct.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
that
means
that
you
go
back
and
interrogate
the
city
council
members
about
what
their
intent
is.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
ninth
circuit
itself
has
held
in
the
foley
case,
that
you
can't
do
that.
if
we
had
a
remand
here,
we
can't,
nobody
can
go
back
and
subpoena
and
take
the
depositions
of
the
city
council
members
and
determine
what
they
thought,
and
of
course
we
don't
think
you
should.
so,
i
don't
think
it
means
that.
i
think
what
it
means...
you
see,
we
put
the
emphasis
on
interest,
the
government
interest
must
be
unrelated.
and
the
governmental
interest
in
this
case
is
clearly
a
proper
one;
namely,
to
make
sure
that
these
adverse
secondary
effects
do
not
impact
upon
residences
and
churches
and
so
forth.
that
is
the
interest,
i
think,
that
is
involved,
and
that
is
wholly
unrelated.
we
recognize
in
our
findings,
there
is
a
finding
which
the
city
council
entered
which
says
specifically
that
these
theatres
have
a
right
to
operate.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
it's
unrelated
to
the
suppression
of
speech
and
what
the,
what
the--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
but
it's
not
because
of
that.
it's
because
of
the
secondary
effects.
it's
because
of
what's--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--well,
i'm
not--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--it
is
related.
the
secondary
effects
are
related
in
a
sense
that
these
kind
of
films
do
apparently
draw
transience,
that
they
do
apparently
create
more
crime,
so
in
that--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--sense,
it
is
related,
but--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--it
didn't
make
any
difference
in
young.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
it
certainly
didn't.
absolutely.
let
me
just
say
that
i've
indicated
that
you
shouldn't
really
reach
the
issue
of
intent,
and
i
would
certainly
hope
that
you
wouldn't,
but
if
you
do
i
hope
that
you
will
reach
it
on
the
basis
of
the
city
council's
findings
and
not
kind
of
get
into
some
kind
of
subjective
inquiry
into
what
the
city
council
might
have
had
in
mind.
let
me
just
say
one
other
thing,
and
then
i
will
reserve
my
time.
small
cities
like
renton
are
dealing
with
a
very
serious
problem
here,
and
they
have
been
largely
unsuccessful
in
doing
it.
these
adult
theatres
are
proliferating.
they
are
moving
into
areas
unlike
what
they
used
to,
sort
of
out
on
the
edges
or
perhaps
right
in
the
middle
of
downtown.
they're
going
all
over
now.
and
we
have
made
a
good
faith
attempt
that
was
not
directed
toward
a
single
theatre,
which
sometimes
the
case.
a
theatre
moves
in
and
we
say,
we're
going
to
get
that
theatre.
we
didn't
do
that.
we,
we,
we
wanted
to
deal
with
the
problem
in
advance,
and
we
submit
to
you
it
was
a
good
faith
attempt,
and
we
have
left
plenty
room,
room
that's
more
than
commodious
enough
for
these
theatres
to
come
into.
it's
easily
accessible.
and
i
submit
to
you
that
if
this
effort
fails,
that
it
will
really
prevent
small
cities
and
towns
across
the
country
from
dealing
in
an
intelligent
fashion
ahead
of
time
with
this
very
serious
problem.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
hope
i
have,
your
honor.
well,
the
first
one--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--the
first
one
related
to
whether
we
can
rely
on
the
examples
of
other
cities.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
the
second
related
to
the
nature
of
the
set-aside
zone
itself,
and
the
third
related
to
the
motive
of
the
city
council.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
three
brief
points,
your
honor.
first,
my
co-counsel
tells
me
i
said
that
i
was
out
there
ten
years,
and
i
meant
ten
days
ago.
i
apologize
to
the
court.
the
first
point
is
this.
mr.
burns
said
that
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
adult
theatres
attract
people
other
than
those
that
are
here
in
the
courtroom.
i
assure
you
that
that
is
not
the
case;
that
this
record
shows,
through
mr.
clemmons'
testimony,
who
attended
virtually
all
of
these
meetings,
that
what
these
committees
and
the
city
council
considered
were
the
experiences
of
other
cities
as
reflected
in
some
documents,
but
primarily
in
the
decisions
which,
as
justice
rehnquist
has
pointed
out,
fully
set
forth
precisely
what
had
gone
on
in
those
communities.
justice
stevens,
in
the
seattle
case,
northend
cinema,
if
you...
they
noted
that
the
apple
theatre,
for
example,
in
the
first
hill
community
by
itself,
and
then
two
other
theatres
in
another
residential
community,
had
the
adverse
effects.
mr.
clemmons
had
been,
incidentally,
for
seven
years
in
milpedes,
california,
where
they
had
had
an
adult
problem,
and
he
was
familiar
with
that
and
could
tell
the
city
council
about
it.
the
record
also
indicates
that
we
looked
at
tacoma.
tacoma
had
a
case
which
the
ninth
circuit,
where
they
approved
a
zoning
ordinance
in
an
unreported
decision.
we've
cited
that
in
our
reply
brief--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--yes,
they
did.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
they
cited
actual
in
that
case,
and
it
was
primarily
based
upon
things
such
as
property
values
going
down
and
that
kind
of
thing,
which
of
course
we
relied
on
here.
if
you
want
to
see
a
good
example
of
a
study
which
goes
to
a
single
theatre,
look
at
the
phoenix
study,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
which
compared
a
single
adult
theatre
in
an
area
with
another
area
that
did
not
have
one
and
found,
for
example,
that
the
crime
rate
was
three
times
as
high.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that
was
going
to
be
my
third
point,
and
i'll
go
to
it
immediately,
justice
stevens.
it
seems,
the
reason
that
we
haven't
paid
much
attention
to
that
in
our
briefs
is
that
we're
happy
to
have
you
use
strict
scrutiny
if
you
want
to,
because
we
think
we
passed
the
test.
but
it
seems
to
use
that
the
bose
test
is
really
a
strange
one
to
use
in
this
context
for
the
reasons
that
justice
powell
pointed
out,
and
it
is
very
interesting
that
the
ninth
circuit
itself,
different
panels
admittedly,
in
the
tacoma
case
and
the
city
of
carona
case,
which
is
cited
by
mr.
burns
in
one
of
his
later
briefs,
both
use
the
clearly
erroneous
test
in
this
situation.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
in
a
situation
where
you
have
such
an
incidental
restriction
on
first
amendment
rights
as
opposed
to
one
where
you
have
a
total
exclusion
or
some
factor
such
as
the
malice
situation--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--i
think
you
can
assume
that
here.
the
most
that
we
have
in
this--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
where
you
have
an
area
that
will
accommodate
over
400
theatres
and
it's
readily
accessible
and
criss-crossed
by
roads,
the
most
that
you've
got
is
an
inconvenience.
somebody
who
may
want
to
be
downtown
and
see
one
is
going
to
have
to
drive
for
a
little
bit.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
if
there
was
sufficient
proof,
availability
wouldn't
make
any
difference?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
don't
go
that
far.
i
don't
say
that
if
you
had
harm
to
residential
neighborhoods
you
could
zone
them;
you
could
do
a
schad.
i
don't
say
that.
and
i
think
the
reason,
justice
white,
is
that
there
would
then
have
to
be
some
accommodation.
you
might
have
to,
you
might
have
to
restrict
your
area
from
1,000
feet
to
500.
you
might
have
to
accommodate
in
some
fashion
to
make
sure
that
there
was
some
outlet
for
this
expression.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
it's
clearly
that
in
this
case,
yes.
the
only
other
point
i
would
make
is
that
he
said
that
we
zoned
him
out
of
the
commercial
area.
we
didn't
zone
them
away
from
the
commercial
area,
we
zoned
them
away
from
residences
and
churches
and
stuff,
and
it
just
so
happened
that
in
our
city
they're
all
mixed
in
with
the
commercial
zone,
so
they're
not
right
downtown.
but
let
me
pose
this
question
to
you.
do
they
have
a
right,
do
they
have
a
constitutional
right
to
be
where
they
want
to
be,
where
most
customers
are
walking
by
the
door,
where
they
don't
have
to
put
up
signs
because
there's
so
many
people
walking
by
that
they'll
get
a
ready
audience?
or
can
we
put
them
away
from
where
they're
doing
the
harm
but
where
people
can
still
go,
you
still
have
plenty
of
film,
plenty
of
theatres,
plenty
of
access,
and
everybody
can
see
what
they
want
to?
and
with
that,
i
hope
very
much
that
you'll
reverse.
