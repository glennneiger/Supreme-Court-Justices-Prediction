unknown
speaker
i
know
that's
your
claim.
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
this
theatre,
are
you
referring
to
an
unbuilt
theatre
in
renton?
unknown
speaker
it
would
be
hard
to
get
any
empirical
evidence
that
an
unbuilt
theatre
did
much
of
anything
in
renton,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
you
say
that--
unknown
speaker
--but
they
can't
go
to
seattle.
unknown
speaker
but
it,
but
if
seattle
made
a
study
in
anticipation
of
taking
some
action
in
its
city,
regardless
of
what
action
seattle
took
as
a
result,
why
can't
the
city
of
renton
rely
on
the
studies
paid
for
and
produced
by
the
city
of
seattle?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
state
of
washington's
courts
looked
at
it,
and
i
would
think
that
might
even
be
the
best
evidence.
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't,
even
though
the
court's
decision
is
based
on,
on
satisfactory
empirical
data?
unknown
speaker
do
you
contend
that
the
court
somehow
has
to
make
sure
that
every
city
council
member
has
set
aside
so
much
time
and
really
studied
a
particular
thing
in
a
particular
manner
to
survive
constitutional
testing
of
their
actions?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think
any
post
hoc
production
of
evidence
would
suffice?
unknown
speaker
mr.
burns,
supposing
they
had
a
growing,
a
rapidly
growing
city,
and
didn't
have
any
motion
picture
theatres
at
all,
and
they
had
to
plan
a
city
plan
with
zoning
in
it,
and
they
decide
to
put
motion
picture
theatres
in
a
commercial
zone.
do
they
have
to
go
out
and
make
an
independent
study,
or
can
they
rely
on
the
experience
of
other
cities
for
that
kind
of
decision?
clearly,
it
would
burden
the
first
amendment
interest.
unknown
speaker
so,
it's
critical
to
your
case,
as
i
understand
it,
it's
critical
to
your
case
that
this
is
a
content
regulation?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
do
really
ask
us
to
re-examine
young?
unknown
speaker
you
say
so
in
so
many
words
in
your
brief,
and
i'm
just
surprised
you
don't
stick
to
your
guns.
unknown
speaker
before
you
move
to
another...
the
district
court
found,
and
this
is
on
page
28a
of
the
appendix,
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement,
28a,
the
last
sentence
in
the
full
paragraph
on
that
page,
that
ample
accessible
real
estate
is
available
for
the
location
of
adult
theatres
in
renton.
the
court
of
appeals
declined
to
accept
that.
it
also
declined
to
apply
the
clearly
erroneous
rule
to
it,
relying
on
this
court's
decision
in
bose,
b-o-s-e.
do
you
rely
on
bose?
unknown
speaker
you're
aware
that
bose
involved
sullivan
against
new
york
times
and
proof
of
malice.
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
to
prove
malice
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
is
bose
relevant,
then?
unknown
speaker
in
every
first
amendment
case?
unknown
speaker
even
where
the
district
court
has
held
that
the
effect
on
first
amendment
rights,
if
any,
was
quite
incidental?
unknown
speaker
--mixed
question
of
fact
and
law?
unknown
speaker
why
did
they,
why
did
they
approve
that?
did
they
recite
the
adverse
effects?
unknown
speaker
likely
or
probable
or
actual,
or
what?
unknown
speaker
mr.
prettyman,
may
interrupt
you?
you're
now
focusing
on
the
justification
for
the
ordinance,
and
turn
your
attention
to
what
remains
available
for
the
adult
theatres,
that
phase
of
the
case,
and
that
as
justice
powell
pointed
out,
the
district
court
found
that
there
was
ample
accessible
real
estate
there,
and
the
court
of
appeals
then
says
the
standard
of
review
is
de
novo.
what,
in
your
view,
is
the
correct
standard
of
review
of
that
finding
of
fact?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
in
young,
of
course,
it
was
specifically
assumed
that
the
total
market
for
the
particular
speech
was
not
diminished.
unknown
speaker
you
can't
under
this
finding,
but
the
question
is
whether
that
finding
is
important
enough
to
merit
more
careful
review
and
some
finding--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
prettyman,
i
take
it
that
your
opposition
indicated
that
there
was
sufficient
proof
of
probable
injury
to
residential
neighborhoods,
that
availability
wouldn't
make
any
difference.
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
no.
if
there
was
sufficient
proof
of
harm
to
residential
neighborhoods--
unknown
speaker
--but
you
think
that
whatever,
whatever
threshold
availability
there
was
was
passed,
here?
