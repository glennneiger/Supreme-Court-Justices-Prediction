justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
the
record
show
us
whether
the
city
considered
the
commercial
suitability
of
the
520
acres
that
were
set
aside
for
adult
theatre
usage?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
as
to
the
suitability
of
the
property
that
was
available
for
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
part
of
any
required
consideration,
do
you
think,
to
uphold
the
validity
of
a
zoning
regulation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
it
relevant
that
the
city
at
least
consider
it
as
part
of
the
calculus,
do
you
think--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--so
that
deference
could
be
given
to
it
if
has
considered.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
that
regard,
mr.
prettyman,
the
ordinance
of
this
city
was
justified
on
the
secondary
effects
that
these
theatres
have
on
particular
other
land
uses,
like
residence
land
or
churches
or
schools.
now,
does
the
record
show
us
whether
the
city
relied
on
evidence
of
that
sort
gathered
in
other
cities?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
did
seattle's
studies
show
the
secondary
effects
of
having
an
adult
theatre
in
a
residential
neighborhood?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
prettyman,
do
you
think
that
the
court
has
to
analyze
this
statute
under
the
o'brien
factors?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
am
asking.
[laughter]
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
o'brien
factors
were
applied,
one
of
them
is
a
requirement
that
the
governmental
interests
be
unrelated
to
the
suppression
of
free
speech.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
how
would
you
apply
that
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
now,
is
none
of
the
property
in
the
520
acres
zoned
for
commercial
use?
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
any
of
the
property
in
the
520
acres
zoned
for
commercial
use?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
the
record
disclose
that
there
is
at
least
one
shopping
center
in
the
520
acres?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
141a?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
up
in
the
extreme
right
corner?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
oh,
i
see.
he
has
that
upside
down.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
there
would
be
other
undeveloped
land
nearby--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
presumably
could
be
available?
