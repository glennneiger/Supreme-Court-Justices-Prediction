we
will
hear
argument
this
morning
in
the
city
of
renton,
et
al.
v.
playtime
theatres,
inc.,
et
al.
mr.
prettyman,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.

mr.

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
mr.
burns,
is
it
not
more
accurately
the
kind
of
people
it
attracts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you're
saying
is
that
we
cannot
take
traditional
notice
of
the
contrary?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
said
something
that
i'm
not
sure
i
understand.
it's
about
what
the
members
of
the
city
council
were
thinking;
what
influenced
their
opinions.
is
it
not
reasonable
to
assume
that
the
members
of
any
city
council
in
a
particular
state
know
what's
going
on
in
other
cities?
what
the
experience
of
other
cities
is,
whether
it's
with
traffic
or
flooding
or
with
these
so-called
adult
theatres?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
why
do
they
have
to...
do
they
have
to
put
their
concerns
in
the
record?
do
they
have
to
say
what
they're
thinking?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
they
have
against
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
prettyman?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
