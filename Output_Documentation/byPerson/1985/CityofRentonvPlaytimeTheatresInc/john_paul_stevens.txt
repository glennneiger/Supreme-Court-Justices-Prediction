mr.
prettyman,
can
i
interrupt
you
with
something
that's
troubling
me--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--about
the
case?
did
the
court
of
appeals,
in
the
words
of
the
jurisdictional
statute,
hold
the
ordinance
invalid,
in
your
view?
i'm
just
wondering
if
we
have
an
appellate
jurisdictional
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
sent
it
back
for
allowing
to
shore
up
the
record,
in
effect.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
your
argument
on
the
merits
of
the
motive,
but
if
that
issue
remains
open,
is
it
clear
that
they
have
already
directed
the
district
judge
to
hold
the
ordinance
invalid?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
there...
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
burns,
if
your
opponent
is
right...
i
haven't
read
this,
the
washington
case,
but
he
said
that
in
the
seattle
experience
there
was
one
theatre
out
in
a
residential
neighborhood,
and
that
that
was
a
bone
of
contention,
and
that
would
be
a
comparable
example,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
were
separated
from
one
another.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
indicated
they
were
separated
from
one
another,
so
you
might
have
a
residential
neighborhood
with
one
theatre
in
it,
and
they
said
you
have
to
move
that
theatre.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
just
to
the
point
of
whether
there
is
anything
on
which
they
could
base
concern
about
a
single
theatre,
at
least
that
would
be
some
evidence,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
for
that
argument
you
basically
ask
us
to
re-examine
young,
don't
you?
