mr.
jack
r.

mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court's
decisions
allow
regulation
of
an
adult
business
whose
operational
characteristics
produce
some
identifiable
secondary
effect.
in
other
words,
is
there,
is
the
form
of
speech
intrusive
in,
to
some
extent?
is
it
too
loud;
is
it
too
ugly?
we're
talking,
essentially,
about
a
secondary
effect
that
we
can
see,
touch,
hear
or
feel.
in
other
words,
is
the
mode
incompatible
with
the
zone
that
we're
dealing
with?
renton's
ordinance,
on
the
other
hand,
is
related
solely
to
perceptions
about
the
effects
of
the
content
of
the
speech.
it's
not
related
to
land
use
concerns.
it's
aimed
at
the
speech
and
not
at
the
style
of
the
speech.
mr.
jack
r.
burns
your
honor,
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
this
kind
of
speech
attracts
any
other
kind
of
people
than
the
people
that
are
in
this
courtroom.
there's
nothing
in
this
record
that
establishes
that
it
attracts
an
adverse
kind
of
people
or
anybody
other
than
the
general
public
that
is
making
itself
or
desires
to
make
adult
material
available
to--
mr.
jack
r.
burns
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
we
have
to
look
to
what
this
court
said
in
young,
in
that
certain
things
are
not,
are
not,
we
just
can't
assume
that
they
exist
as
a
matter
of
experience.
the
only
thing
that
this
court
found
as
a
matter
of
experience
that
they
could
rely
on
in
young
was
that
congregating
various
types
of
uses
together
produced
a
detrimental
secondary
effect,
and
that
effect
was
a
deterioration
of
property
values.
but
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
what
happened
in
young.
there,
you
had
an
ordinance
that
had
been
in
place
for
years.
it
regulated
many
kinds
of
uses,
and
what
young
did,
or
detroit
did,
was
they
added
adult
theatres
to
those
regulated
uses,
and
said
these
uses,
all
of
them
as
a
whole,
when
they
congregate
together,
they
produce
this
adverse
secondary
effect
of
a
deletion
in
property
values.
that
is
not
the
case
here.
what
this
ordinance
does
and
what
renton
has
done
is
said
that
a
single
adult
theatre
in
a
commercial
zone,
not
in
regard
to
other
businesses
that
may
be
regulated
or
may
not
be
regulated,
because
it
doesn't
regulate
any
other
kind
of
business,
that
that
single
adult
business
will
cause
these
deleterious
effects.
mr.
jack
r.
burns
yes,
sir?
mr.
jack
r.
burns
your
honor,
i
take
exception
to
his
description
of
what
the
experience
of
seattle
was.
mr.
jack
r.
burns
your
honor,
if
the
city
of
renton
is
going
to
rely
on
seattle's
experience,
it
should
target
the
same
evils
at
which
seattle
targeted
its
ordinance,
and
it
should
rely
on
the
same
means.
it
should
not
be
able
to
say--
mr.
jack
r.
burns
--your
honor,
i
think
it's
risky
to
rely
on
the
experience
of
other
cities
for
a
number
of
reasons.
mr.
jack
r.
burns
absolutely,
because
what
we
do
then,
if
you
allow
a
city
such
as
renton
to
pick
the
city
of
seattle
or
pick
the
city
of
tacoma
and
say,
they
passed
an
ordinance,
we
are
going
to
mimic
it,
we
are
going
to
rely
on
it,
you
have
effective
immunized
and
sanitized
that
ordinance
from
judicial
scrutiny,
even
though
the
reasons
may
be
painfully
fabricated;
even
though
the
reasons
that
they
assert
may
not
apply
in
their
city.
because
i
would
submit
to
this
court
that--
mr.
jack
r.
burns
--no,
it
wouldn't,
your
honor.
as
i
recall,
there
were
three
theatres
out
in
residential
neighborhoods
that
were
affected
by--
mr.
jack
r.
burns
--pardon
me?
mr.
jack
r.
burns
that's
true,
but
what
they
did
in
seattle
was
different
than
what
renton
did
here.
seattle
moved
all
the
adult
theatres--
mr.
jack
r.
burns
--but,
your
honor,
it
may
be
some
evidence,
but
i
think
we
have
to
look
to
the
issue
that
we
have
to
solve
these
problems
that
deal
with
first
amendment
concerns
by
the
least
intrusive
means.
you
do
not
take
a
sledge
hammer
when
a
scalpel
will
do.
the
experience
of
seattle
is
different--
mr.
jack
r.
burns
--no,
i'm
not
asking
you
to
re-examine
young,
because
i
think
that
this
case
is--
mr.
jack
r.
burns
--different
than
young.
well,
i
did
to
the
extent
that
it's
a
time,
place
or
manner
restriction,
but
on
the
basic
facts
i'm
not
asking
you
to
re-examine
young.
i
think
that
this
case
can
be
decided
within
the
confines
of
young.
but
i
don't
think
this
is
a
young
case.
mr.
jack
r.
burns
your
honor,
the
young
case,
as
i
read
it,
is,
as
i
read
justice
stevens'
opinion,
is
that
if
there
is
a
demonstrable
adverse
secondary
effect
that
we
can
see
and
we
can
touch
and
we
can
feel,
the
city
can
be
concerned
about
that
and
regulate
it
by
the
least
intrusive
means.
in
young,
the
court
made
its
decision
based
upon
the
fact
that
there
were
a
myriad
of
locations
available,
that
there
were
locations
available
in
all
kinds
of
zones,
all
commercial
zones.
the
renton
ordinance
specifically
removes
adult
theatres
from
all
commercial
zones
of
the
city
of
renton.
they
simply
are
not
allowed
in
the
commercial
zones.
if,
i
think
in
that
respect
a
look
at
the
map
is
useful.
if
you
would
look
at
the
last
page
of
the
jurisdictional
statement,
which
is
page
142a,
appendix
v,
you
can
see
where
these
theatres
have
been
relegated
to.
it's
essentially
an
industrial
wasteland.
there
are
undeveloped
areas.
there's
a
tank
farm.
it's
criss-crossed
with
railroad
spurs.
it
is
essentially--
mr.
jack
r.
burns
--it
would,
because
a
drive-in
theatre
probably
would
not
be
permitted
in
that
zoning.
essentially,
the
drive-in
theatre
business
in
this
country
in
commercial
areas--
mr.
jack
r.
burns
--it's
in
the
record
below
that
there
would
be
a
zoning
change
required
in
order
to
locate
an
adult
theatre
in
this
area.
these
are
permissible
locations,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
zoning
is
appropriate.
mr.
jack
r.
burns
no,
your
honor,
but
i
think
access
has
three
components.
those
components
are,
first,
permissible
locations;
secondly,
that
those
locations,
that
there
be
available
locations
to
go
to;
and
thirdly,
that
there
be
suitable
locations
for
a
commercial
business
such
as
a
theatre.
mr.
jack
r.
burns
your
honor,
if
the
city
is
going
to
regulate
and
restrict
where
a
theatre
can
locate,
and
in
fact
nobody
will
sell
or
rent
property
to
a
theatre,
the
restriction
and
burden
on
speech
has
become
substantial,
not
incidental,
because
there
is
no
place
that
they
can
go.
mr.
jack
r.
burns
no,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
r.
burns
it
wouldn't
because
if,
if
a
general
audience
theatre
were
permitted
to
locate
in
a
residential
zone,
then
it's
my
position
that
an
adult
theatre
should
be
allowed
to
locate
there
as
well
unless
you
can
demonstrate
that
there's
some
adverse
secondary
effect
that
arises
out
of
the
operation
of
the
adult
theatre
that
does
not
arise
out
of
the
operation
of
the
general
release
theatre.
mr.
jack
r.
burns
your
honor,
the
city
of
renton
didn't
look
at
any
data
from
seattle.
the
record
is
clear
that
all
the
planning
director
and
the
city
council
looked
at
with
respect
to
the
city
of
seattle
was
the
decision
of
our
state
supreme
court.
mr.
jack
r.
burns
yes,
it
did.
mr.
jack
r.
burns
your
honor,
when
we're
looking
at
speech,
i
think
that
we
need
to
have
empirical
evidence
that's
of
a
compelling
nature.
we
can't
rely
upon
hearsay,
opinion--
mr.
jack
r.
burns
--your
honor,
in
a
commercial
zone,
what
is
the
problem
that
transients
cost...
cause?
let
me
ask
that
as
a
rhetorical
question.
that,
the
major
problem
that
i
see
with
the
findings
in
the
renton
ordinance
is
that
they're
assertions.
they're
conclusions.
they're
simply
assertions
of
harm
that
may
not,
in
fact,
exist.
and
if
transients
cause
a
problem,
what
kind
of
problem
is
it
that
they
cause?
there's
no
indication
in
this
record
of
any
sort
what
kind
of
problems
a
transient
would
cause.
now,
if
a
transient
causes
problems,
let's
deal
with
those
problems
in
some
specific
way.
if
it--
mr.
jack
r.
burns
--pardon
me?
mr.
jack
r.
burns
that
may
be
one
answer
to
the
problem,
but
i
think
that
this
court's
decision
required
that
when
we're
dealing
with
first
amendment
concerns,
we
have
to
deal
with
the
problem
in
the
least
intrusive
way.
if
you
had,
as
i
think
justice
blackmun
said
in
schad,
if
there's
a
problem
with
traffic,
deal
with
the
traffic
problem.
if
there's
a
problem
with
signage,
deal
with
the
signage
problem,
but
do
not
simply
relegate
these
theatres
out
to
this
uncommercial
area
in
the
guise
of
meeting
a
land
use
concern.
what
essentially
they're
getting
at
here
is
a
censorship
concern.
mr.
jack
r.
burns
your
honor,
there's
nowhere
in
this
record
that
i
can
find
what
their
concerns
were
about
these
theatres.
mr.
jack
r.
burns
i
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
r.
burns
i
think
what...
they
have
to
make
findings
of
fact
that
justify
the
restriction
on
speech.
i
don't
think
there's
any
way
around
that,
because
if
their
intent
is
to,
is
to
sensor
speech
and
to
oppress
it
in
any
respect,
that's
an
improper
attempt
which
cannot
be
sanctioned
in
any
sense.
what
renton
is
suggesting
to
this
court
is
a
rule
that
would
allow
it
to
state
a
governmental
interest
and
say
that
we
have
made
available
permissible
locations,
and
then
insulate
that
decision
forever
from
judicial
scrutiny,
and
that
rule,
i
don't
believe,
can
be
accepted
by
this
court.
the
essential
difference
between
this
case
and
young
is
that
there
is
an
intolerable
burden
on
speech
that
exists
as
a
result
of
this
ordinance,
and
that's
problem
of
access.
if
government
makes
no
rule
about
access
and
does
not
limit
access
to
speech,
then
there's
no
intrusion
that
can
be
blamed
on
the
government
and
no
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
on
the
other
hand,
if
government
does
make
the
rule
and
government
does
limit
access,
then
i
think
government
has
the
duty
to
establish
that
not
only
are
there
permissible
locations,
but
that
somebody
can
actually
go
there,
because
otherwise
they've
precluded
them
through
a
de
facto
zoning
scheme
from
going
anywhere,
and
they're
created
what
they've
perhaps
set
out
to
do,
was
censor
the
material
and
remove
it
entirely
from
the
city.
in
this
respect,
i
believe
that
the
zone
that
i
described
and
as
depicted
on
that
map
is
a
substantial
burden
on
speech.
the
alternative
locations
are
unsatisfactory.
as
this
court
has
said
before,
an
individual
is
not
to
have
his
right
of
free
speech
circumscribed
on
the
argument
that
he
can
exercise
it
somewhere
else.
these
locations
make
it
more
difficult
both
for
sellers
to
reach
an
audience
and
for
the
public
to
make
the
material
available
to
us...
to
itself.
its
design,
this
ordinance
is
designed
to
prevent
some
people
from
getting
the
information
by
making
it
more
difficult
to
get
it.
what
renton
has
said,
in
essence,
out
of
sight,
out
of
mind.
we
can't
identify
what's
wrong
with
these
locations.
we
can't
identify
what
the
harm
is
to
churches
or
schools,
but
we
know
it
exists
somewhere--
mr.
jack
r.
burns
--well,
your
honor,
to
answer
your
direct
question
about
residential
areas,
i
think
they
could
make
such
a
showing.
they
could
exclude
under
young.
mr.
jack
r.
burns
well,
that
creates
a
more
substantial--
mr.
jack
r.
burns
--okay.
well,
if,
if
they
can
show
a
substantial
harm,
i
believe
that
they
can
regulate,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
r.
burns
yes,
your
honor.
now,
the
reason
that
i
say
that
is
that,
is
that
there
are
locations
out
there,
permissible
locations.
if
none
are
available,
however,
we
have
to
balance
these
interests
that--
mr.
jack
r.
burns
--if
there
is
adequate
proof
of
potential
harm,
they
can
zone
out.
that's
a
demonstrable
secondary
effect.
on
the
other
harm,
your
honor--
mr.
jack
r.
burns
--well,
i
think,
in
my
personal
view,
a
city
has
the
right
to
deal
with
these
problems
as
they
can
any
other
kinds
of
land
use
problems.
however,
in
dealing
with
those
problems,
they
have
to
be
sensitive
to
the
concerns
that
exist.
but
the
problem
here
with
renton
is
that
they
have
zoned
these
theatres
out
of
the
commercial
areas
as
well
as
the
residential
areas.
and
when
you
zone
them
out
of
the
commercial
areas
as
well,
the
problems
that
may
exist
and
the
concerns
that
you're
trying
to
protect
in
a
residential
area
do
not
exist
to
the
same
degree
in
a
commercial
area.
now,
renton's
ordinance
is
different
from
the
ordinance
in
young
and
the
ordinance
in
seattle,
in
that
renton's
ordinance
excludes
these
operations
or
these
businesses
from
a
location
within
<one
thousand>
[=
1,000]
feet
of
any
residential
unit.
mr.
jack
r.
burns
generally,
your
honor,
it's
zoned
for
industrial
use.
mr.
jack
r.
burns
not
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
r.
burns
well,
to
that
extent
that
it
can,
there
are
less--
mr.
jack
r.
burns
--no.
mr.
jack
r.
burns
they
can;
but,
your
honor,
there's
evidence
in
this
record
that
a
commercial
establishment
such
as
a
theatre
requires
a
certain
kind
of
location
that
nobody
disputed.
it's
a
recreational
kind
of
activity.
it
needs
streets--
mr.
jack
r.
burns
--no,
it
would
not
be
against
the
zoning
law.
mr.
jack
r.
burns
yes,
your
honor,
that's
a
fully
developed
shopping...
well,
yes,
it
is.
but
it's,
it
is
in
a
location
which
is
outside
of
that
main
area.
if
i
could
point
it
out
to
you
on
a
map
which
mr.
prettyman
showed
to
you.
it's
the
map
on
page
141.
mr.
jack
r.
burns
141a,
your
honor.
it
is
the
location
which
is
up
here
in
the
corner
that
looks
somewhat
like
an
upside
down
l.
that
is
the
location
of
the
commercial
shopping
center.
mr.
jack
r.
burns
yes,
your
honor,
if
you
can
see
where
i'm
pointing.
it's
sort
of
an
upside
down
l
that's
in
grey.
now,
that
particular
location,
your
honor,
is
a
fully
developed
shopping
center--
mr.
jack
r.
burns
--however,
that
location
is
not
available
in
a
practical
sense,
in
that
the
location
is
very
small
in
size.
in
the
opinion
of
our
experts,
it
would
not
have
enough
land
to
accommodate
an
adult
theatre.
so,
while
that
particular
location
is
both
suitable
and
permissible,
it's
not
available
in
the
sense
that
it's
not
large
enough,
and
it's
not
available
in
the
sense
that
it's
probably
not
for
sale.
mr.
jack
r.
burns
no.
mr.
jack
r.
burns
well,
your
honor,
that
little
l-shaped
area
is
the
only
area
there
that
is
available.
the
other
area
is
that
little
rectangular
area
to,
as
you're
looking
at
the
map,
directly
beneath
it
over
here,
which
is
an
industrial
warehouse
kind
of
area
which
is
served
by
railroads.
and
then
the
main
core
of
the
520
acres
is
down
in
this
undeveloped
land,
which
i
showed
you
in
the
aerial
photograph.
mr.
jack
r.
burns
i
mean
unavailable
in
the
sense
that
somebody
will
not
sell
it
or
rent
it
to
you,
your
honor.
that's
what
i
mean
by
unavailable.
we
had,
the
record
below
establishes
that
there
was
a
real
estate
expert
who
went
around
to
every
property
owner
within
this
land
area
and
queried
whether
their
property
was
for
sale
or
whether
they
would
rent
it
for
use
as
an
adult
theatre.
the
almost
unanimous
answer
of
those
people
was
no.
mr.
jack
r.
burns
not
but
in
that
area
it
wouldn't,
but
there
is
no
proof
that
there's
any
danger--
mr.
jack
r.
burns
--to
the
commercial
areas,
your
honor.
it
is
our
position
that
this
ordinance
asserts
no
compelling
governmental
interest
in
the
sense
that
the
concerns
of
this
ordinance
are
with
the
effects
of
the
content
of
the
speech,
not
the
operational
characteristics
of
the
business,
which
we
believe
is
the
key
determinative
factor.
there's
no
difference
in
this
record
in
the
operational
characteristics
between
an
adult
theatre
and
a
general
audience
theatre.
there's
no
indication
that
this
theatre
draws
transience
or
does
anything
else
of
an
outward
nature.
mr.
jack
r.
burns
yes,
your
honor.
i'm
referring
to
my
client's
theatre
in
one
sense
and
to
the
unbuilt
theatre,
because
this
ordinance
affects
the
first
use
that
comes
into
town.
it's
not
an
ordinance
that
says
that
these
kinds
of
uses
cannot
congregate
together
or
must
be
separated.
mr.
jack
r.
burns
but,
your
honor,
there
are
locations
in
small
cities
within
the
state
of
washington
where
there
is
one
adult
theatre.
mr.
jack
r.
burns
and
they
could
go
get
that
kind
of
evidence
if
they
wanted
to.
mr.
jack
r.
burns
well,
what
they
did
in
seattle
is
different,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that's
the
distinction
and
the
difficulty
in
relying
on
the
experiences
of
other
cities.
if
you're
going
to
rely
on
what
seattle
did,
be
concerned
about
the
same
problems
and
do
the
same
thing.
if
you're
going
to
rely
on
what
detroit
did--
mr.
jack
r.
burns
--your
honor,
i
don't
object
to
that,
but
renton
never
looked
at
that
study
in
this
case.
they
never
even
looked
at
it.
mr.
jack
r.
burns
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
reading
a
court
decision
supplies
the
empirical
basis
needed
to
make
a
zoning
decision.
mr.
jack
r.
burns
your
honor,
it
doesn't
give
you
the
empirical
data,
the
underlying
studies
upon
which
to
make
the
decision.
i
don't
believe
that
simply
by
reading
court
decisions,
any
municipality
can
say
we
have
that
problem;
these
studies
support
our
answer
to
it.
i
just
don't
find
that
persuasive.
in--
mr.
jack
r.
burns
--your
honor,
if
they're
going
to
infringe
upon
first
amendment
interests,
then
the
answer
is
yes.
i
think
that
they
have
to
be
extremely
careful
to
what
they're
doing
in
order
to
place
any
burden
on
speech.
in
that
respect,
i
would--
mr.
jack
r.
burns
--certainly
not
in
this
case,
which
all
the
evidence
was
post
hoc.
but
what
i
would
suggest
as
a
minimum
is
that
if
they're
going
to
rely
on
the
experience
of
other
cities,
that
they
say
that
a
city
compelled
to
assert
precisely
what
it
is
they're
relying
on
and
why
they're
relying
on
it,
and
put
that
in
their
findings
of
fact
and
their
conclusion
of--
mr.
jack
r.
burns
--but,
your
honor,
as
long
as
they
haven't
based
their
decision
on
content,
at
that
point
i
think
what
they've
done
is
okay.
if
they
say
general
audience
theatres
can
be
in
one
zone
and
adult
theatres
have
to
be
in
another
zone,
then
they're
making
a
distinction
based
on--
mr.
jack
r.
burns
--absolutely,
your
honor,
absolutely.
mr.
jack
r.
burns
no--
mr.
jack
r.
burns
--well,
i
don't
think
i'm
asking
you
to
re-examine
young,
because
i
think
that
that
this
case
can
be
analyzed
under
justice
powell's
decision,
his
use
of
the
o'brien
test,
but
i
don't
even
believe
the
o'brien
test
is
appropriate
in
this
case,
because
i
believe
that
the
burden
on
speech
is
substantial
here.
it's
not
minimal
or
incidental,
and
therefore
strict
scrutiny
is
the
test
that
ought
to
be
applied.
and
so,
i
can
live
with
young.
young
says
to
me,
justice
stevens,
that
we
can
base
decisions
on
content
with
respect
to
motion
picture
theatres
so
long
as
there
is
an
identifiable
secondary
effect
from
the
operational
characteristics,
not
that
we
perceive
that
the
speech
is
going
to
have
people
react
or
not
react
in
one
manner
or
another.
let
me
conclude--
mr.
jack
r.
burns
--yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
r.
burns
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
r.
burns
no,
i
don't
think
you
to
have
prove
malice.
i
think--
mr.
jack
r.
burns
--well,
i
think
bose
stands
for
the
proposition
that
where
there
are
fact
law
determinations
and
the
law
is
critical
to
how
one
analyzes
the
facts,
that
the
court
has
the
responsibility
to
examine
those
de
novo.
much
as
in
the
area
of
obscenity,
where
this
court
reviews
de
novo,
or
has
the
right
to
review
de
novo,
the
obscenity
of
any
material
before
it.
a
district
court
or
a
jury
may
find
it
obscene,
and
that's
a
finding
of
fact,
but
this
court
has
to
make
that
ultimate
first
amendment
decision
which
is
based
upon
the
fact
law
problem.
mr.
jack
r.
burns
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
r.
burns
that,
again,
the
incidental
effect
is
another
fact
law
determination
that
i
think
is,
is
critical.
mr.
jack
r.
burns
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
say,
in
conclusion,
that
the
notion
that
pervades
renton's
ordinance
is
that
there's
a
need
to
protect
certain
places,
schools,
churches,
and
so
on
from
adult
theatres.
but
that
need,
that
express
need,
the
whole
purpose
of
this
ordinance
is
nullified
by
the
under-inclusiveness
of
the
ordinance.
this
ordinance
deals
only
with
adult
theatres.
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
or
anything
that
i
can
find
that
establishes
that
an
adult
theatre
has
a
different
operational
characteristic
or
effect
upon
these
places
than
other
adult
businesses
which
are
not
regulated
and
not
subject
to
the
burden
of
this
ordinance.
for
those
reasons,
your
honor,
i
would
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
