mr.
charles
fried
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
formulation
in
the
new
voting
rights
act,
section
2,
was
the
product
of
intense
political
and,
may
i
say,
intellectual
struggle.
the
outcome
of
that
struggle
should
be
quite
familiar
to
this
court
since
it
simply
adopted
the
standard,
the
legal
standard
formulated
by
this
court
in
white
v.
regester.
our
concern
in
this
case
is
one
thing
only,
that
adjudication
under
this
new
voting
rights
act
be
lawful,
that
it
be
constrained
and
disciplined
by
appellate
court
review
which
enforces
the
standard
that
congress
enacted.
now,
congress
chose
a
middle
path
between
two
extremes.
on
one
hand
was
the
extreme
represented
by
the
constitutional
minimum
of
intentional
discrimination,
and
that
was
rejected.
on
the
other
hand
was
the
extreme
of
leaving
the
district
courts
at
large
to
engineer
electoral
outcomes
as
they
thought
best
on
racial
or
group
lines.
what
the
congress
adopted
was,
if
you
like,
an
effects
test,
but
effects
on
what?
effects
on
participation,
on
process,
on
opportunity.
now,
if
fidelity
to
that
standard
is
to
be
enforced,
then
whatever
nuances
there
may
be
in
closer
cases,
it
is
our
position
that
here,
certainly
in
three
and
perhaps
in
all
of
the
five
contested
districts,
but
certainly
in
three
of
them,
we
believe
that
that
standard
of
access,
of
process,
of
opportunity
has
been
met
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
charles
fried
that
is
a
legal
requirement.
this
court
has
said
so
over
and
over
again.
the
legislative
history,
the
senate
report,
makes
it
quite
clear
that
the
importance
is
district
by
district.
mr.
charles
fried
the
court
below
certainly
addressed
each
district,
but
the
court
below
also
seemed
to
be
very
impressed
with
overall
statistics
in
the
state
of
north
carolina
and
we
think
may
have
been
misled
by
its
attention
to
those
overall--
mr.
charles
fried
--if
i
may,
your
honor,
i
would
say
electoral
opportunity
as
evidenced
by
very
great
electoral
success
over
time.
now,
the
reason
we
say
that
the
congressional
standard,
the
white
v.
regester
standard,
if
you
will,
was
met
as
a
matter
of
law
in
three
of
those
five
districts
is
that
in
all
of
those
districts
over
a
protracted
period
of
time,
in
a
couple
of
them
over
nearly
a
decade,
black
representatives
equaled
or
exceeded
the
percentage
of
black
citizens
in
the
population.
nor
was
this
black
success
achieved
by
contrivance
or
through
sufferance
of
the
majority,
but
if
you
like,
in
the
old
fashioned
way
through
politics,
through
participation
in
party
politics,
in
some
cases
by
blacks
serving
as
chairmen
of
the
local
majority
political
parties.
mr.
charles
fried
we
are
addressing
the
harder
case,
because
we
think
even
on
the
harder
case
the
case
is
made
out,
which
is
the
population.
if
it
were
registration
then
we
could
we
have
an
argument
about
whether
that
registration
was
in
some
sense
unfairly
depressed.
but
even
if
you
take
population,
these
factors
are
made
out
in
those
three
districts.
but
the
thing
we
find
most
striking
is
that
the
single
member
districts
which
seemed
so
dear
to
the
heart
of
the
appellees
and
the
district
court,
if
the
multi-member
district
had
been
broken
up
into
single
member
districts,
the
result
would
have
been
not
an
increase
in
black
opportunity
and
participation
but
a
decrease,
since
the
number
of
representatives,
black
representatives
would
have
been
the
same.
yet,
the
black
citizens
living
outside
of
the
favored
super-majority
single-member
districts
would
have
been,
on
the
district
court's
hypothesis
voting
patterns,
deprived
of
an
opportunity
which
they
manifestly
enjoyed
under
the
state's
previous
multi-district
system.
mr.
charles
fried
on
the
contrary,
your
honor.
the
district
court
specifically
found
that
there
had
been
assiduous
efforts
to
remove
such
barriers.
now,
i
would
in
the
last
moments
simply
like
to
say
that
there
is
some
confusion
suggested
by
appellees
that
we
are
arguing
for
a
standard
of
tokenism
because
we
speak
of
minorities
not
being
locked
out
or
shut
out
of
the
electoral
process.
when
we
do
so,
we
do
so
only
in
quotation
marks,
quoting
either
mr.
armand
derfner
or
senator
kennedy,
when
those
proponents
of
the
act
were
saying
we're
emphasizing
that
the
act
spoke
of
opportunity
and
access.
our
language
is
more
generous
and
more
cautious.
we
say
it
must
be
equal
access
and
equal
opportunity.
mr.
charles
fried
not
at
all.
we
think,
as
we
say
in
our
brief
and
i
would
very
much
direct
the
court's
attention
to
note
12
of
page
8
of
the
brief,
that
it
is
the
views
of
senator
dole
which
ought
to
be
given
particular
weight
in
interpreting
the
formulation
which
was
arrived
at.
we
do
not,
and
i
don't
believe
in
our
brief
do
we
ever
attach
particular
significance
to
the
views
of
senator
hatch.
it's
senator
dole
that
we
rely
on,
at
least
senator
dole
as
he
spoke
in
the
senate.
i
thank
the
court
for
its
attention.
