unknown
speaker
if
there
was
an
outright
reversal,
then
the
legislature
would
have
to
start
all
over
again,
would
they?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
major
error,
you
think
the
district
court
made
in
concluding
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
what's
the
principal
way
it
did
that?
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
inquire,
i
also
have
a
little
trouble,
as
justice
white
did,
in
getting
the
heart
of
your
theory.
with
respect
to
each
of
the
districts,
the
district
court
did
make
some
factual
determination.
i
take
it
you
don't
challenge
any
of
those;
you
just
say
they're
not
sufficient
to
justify
the--
unknown
speaker
--they
went
through
district
by
district
and
talked
about
polarized
voting
and
one
thing
and
another.
that
part
you
accept?
unknown
speaker
is
that
because...
your
basic
point,
as
i
understand
it,
is
if
the
net
result
of
all
the
voting
is
something
that
roughly
equals
proportional
representation,
then
as
a
matter
of
law
there
can't
be
a
violation
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
in
what?
unknown
speaker
in
the
processes,
it
says...
doesn't
the
statute
say,
"and
to
elect"?
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
just
quote
the
statute.
what
is
it?
unknown
speaker
and
to
elect?
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
think
the
cases
emphasize
racially
polarized
voting?
unknown
speaker
why
is
it?
unknown
speaker
but
even
with
polarized
voting,
why,
everybody's
vote
is
counted.
nobody
is
denied
a
vote.
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
just
assume
that
the
court
was
correct
in
finding
that
there
was
severe
polarized
voting
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
your
position,
but
if
there
were
severe
polarized
voting
in
this
case,
you'd
have
a
much
tougher
case,
with
these
multi-member--
unknown
speaker
--well,
i
can
ask
the
solicitor.
unknown
speaker
mr.
fried,
do
you
think
that
the
court
is
required
to
make
a
separate
vote
dilution
finding
as
to
each
district?
is
that
a
legal
requirements?
unknown
speaker
and
by
doing
that,
did
the
court
below
effectively
do
that
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
it
should
have
focused
on
electoral
success
of
black
candidates
in
each
district
over
a
period
of
time?
unknown
speaker
we
were
addressing,
mr.
solicitor
general,
the
total
of
the
racial
population
are
the
registered
voters
in
each
category.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
evidence
in
this
case
of
barriers
to
registration
that
existed
in
the
past?
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general,
are
you
still
of
the
view
that
senator
dole's
views
are
particularly
persuasive,
or
have
you
switched
now
to
senator
hatch?
unknown
speaker
never
elected
to
what?
unknown
speaker
those
are
both
multi-member
districts,
8
and
2?
unknown
speaker
how
many?
unknown
speaker
and
two?
unknown
speaker
is
that
a
single
member
district?
unknown
speaker
mr.
chambers,
help
me
on
those
two
districts.
i
understand
that
your
opponents,
they
don't
contest
those
any
more?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
three
districts
that
the
solicitor
general
now
particularly
disagrees
with
the...
or
disagree
with
the
district
court
order?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
where
do
we
begin?
unknown
speaker
what
page?
that's
all
right.
we'll
find
it.
unknown
speaker
is
this...
how
many
are
elected
from
this
district?
unknown
speaker
eight.
and
how
many
black
members
were
elected
from
district
36?
unknown
speaker
and
no
election
since
then?
unknown
speaker
i
thought,
mr.
chambers,
that
the
focus
of
the
solicitor
general's
brief
was
on
house
districts
39,
23
and
21.
unknown
speaker
rather
than
36,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
and
what
was
the
election
success
experienced
in
those
three
counties,
in
those
three
districts,
39,
21
and
23?
unknown
speaker
and
if
there
were
single
member
districts
doing
the
best
you
could
for
the
blacks
in
39,
you
probably
couldn't
have
more
than
two?
unknown
speaker
mr.
chambers--
--with
safe
majorities?
unknown
speaker
mr.
chambers,
i
understood
the
solicitor
general
to
say
that
if
these
districts
were
broken
up,
that
blacks
would
have
less
opportunity
to
be
elected.
i
suppose
that
might
depend
on
the
way
they
were
broken
up,
but
what
is
your
response
to
that?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
want
any
further
breaking
up
of
those
districts?
unknown
speaker
any
more
than--
unknown
speaker
--has
the
legislature
acted,
or
do
you
merely
have
the
court
approval?
unknown
speaker
so,
they
are
in
effect?
unknown
speaker
but
it's
still
via
court
order?
unknown
speaker
are
you
talking
about
each
one
of
these
districts?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
way
it...
under
single
member
districts
you're
certainly
not
going
to
have
any
chance
to
influence--
unknown
speaker
--how
about
past
experience
in
23
and
21?
unknown
speaker
until
the
court
adopted
this
plan,
had
there
ever
been
a
black
elected
in
23?
unknown
speaker
and
since
then
too?
unknown
speaker
each--
unknown
speaker
--in
this
multi-member
district?
unknown
speaker
there
has
been
one
black
elected?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that,
but
you
wouldn't
get
any
more
under
single
member
districts?
unknown
speaker
how
about
21?
unknown
speaker
and
since?
unknown
speaker
and
of
course
under
the
single
member
district
there
has
been
a
black
elected.
so,
how
many
elections
were
there,
beginning
with
'80
and
then
'82,
there
was
a
black
elected?
unknown
speaker
and
'84,
is
under
the
court
plan?
unknown
speaker
and
in
district
39,
as
long
as
we're
going
over
these
three,
could
you
recount
what
has
happened
there
as
well?
unknown
speaker
well,
don't
you
have...
to
pretty
well
have
to
depend
on
the
polarized
voting
aspect
of
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
certainly
weren't
excluded
from
participating
in
registering
or
voting
or
in
the
party
processes
at
all,
and
the
party
of
your
choice,
you
had
just
as
much
influence
as
anybody
else.
and
it's
just
when
it
comes
to...
and
you
had
candidates,
did
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
do
you
depend
on
in
this
case
for
this
conclusion
of--
unknown
speaker
--of
exclusion
from
access,
from
non-access.
what
do
you
depend
on
except
polarized
voting
as
really
important?
unknown
speaker
how
does
it
do
that?
unknown
speaker
do
you
defend
the
definition
of
polarized
voting
that
the
district
court
expressed?
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
they
in
fact
do,
do
you
mean
in
this
particular
situation,
not
generally
over
the
country?
unknown
speaker
historically,
back
in
the
18th
century
or
when,
just
the
last
few
years
or
when?
unknown
speaker
that's
the
period.
unknown
speaker
is
there
party
registration
in
north
carolina?
unknown
speaker
even
though
there's
a
majority
of
what,
democrats?
unknown
speaker
and
yet
you
couldn't
elect
a
black
democrat?
unknown
speaker
mr.
chambers,
do
you
think
the
court
looked
at
all...
in
determining
the
racial
block
voting,
at
the
intensity
of
the
block
voting,
to
look
at
factors
that
might
explain
the
actual
interest,
difference
in
interests
at
stake
to
determine
the
intensity
of
the
voting?
unknown
speaker
not
intent,
intensity.
in
other
words,
the
reasons
that
explain
the
statistical
disparity
in
the
voting,
and
factor
in
to
some
degree
electoral
success.
do
you
think
the
court
has
to
do
that
in
appraising
racial
block
voting?
unknown
speaker
mr.
chambers,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
that
probably
has
a
very
simple
answer
but
it
doesn't
occur
to
me
at
the
moment.
how
do
you
know
what
percentage
of
whites
failed
to
vote
for
black
voters,
and
what
percentage
of
blacks
did
not
vote
for
whites
as
distinguished
from
voting
for
blacks?
unknown
speaker
based
on
what?
unknown
speaker
these
are
estimates,
though,
aren't
they?
you
really
can't
tell.
unknown
speaker
voting
is
secret,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
in
north
carolina?
unknown
speaker
while
i've
interrupted
you,
when
were
all
the
barriers
to
registration
of
blacks
removed?
unknown
speaker
removed
officially.
i
know
the
argument
is
that
there
were
lingering
effects.
unknown
speaker
up
to
1970?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
another
factual
question
while
you're
off
the
track.
in
the
maps
that
you
called
our
attention
to,
for
example
house
district
23
which
has
three
members,
there's
also
information
concerning
the
residence
of
the
members.
in
each
map,
there
are
more
residences
than
there
are
members,
and
i'm
puzzled.
there's
six
people
indicated
and
only
three
members.
and
what
is
the
significance
of
the
residence
of
the
members?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
was
happening
to
look
at
23.
unknown
speaker
well,
of
all
elected
officials,
not
just--
unknown
speaker
--since--
unknown
speaker
--oh,
i
see,
so
that
covers
more
than
one
term
of
office?
unknown
speaker
i
was
wondering
if
you
were
making
the
point...
it
just
occurs
to
me
that
perhaps
if
you
had
single
member
districts
instead
of
multi-member,
maybe
you'd
have
the
same
number
of
blacks
but
they
might
be
different
blacks?
unknown
speaker
in
what
district
was
that?
unknown
speaker
in
single
member
districts
you're
only
going
to
be
able
to
vote
for
one
candidate?
unknown
speaker
single-shot
voting
could
never
alone
elect
a
black
candidate
in
these
multi-member
districts?
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
chambers,
you
argue
that
52-a
is
applicable.
is
that
because
all
these
findings
are
to
be
treated
just
as
questions...
findings
of
fact?
unknown
speaker
not
as
mixed
questions
of
law
and
fact?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
do,
historical
facts,
but
don't
you
think
the
definition
of
polarized
voting
is
a
legal
question?
unknown
speaker
that
may
be,
but
even
so--
--it
still
is
a
legal
question,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
and
that's
one
of
the
things
that
is
attacked
here.
unknown
speaker
and
only
first
by
disagreeing
with
the
definition
they
think
the
district
court
adopted?
