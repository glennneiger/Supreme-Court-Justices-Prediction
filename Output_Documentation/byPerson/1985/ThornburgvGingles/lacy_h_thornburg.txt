mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
honorable
court,
this
case
in
its
final
posture
before
the
court
involves
four
multi-member
house
legislative
districts
and
one
multi-member
senate
district
in
the
state
of
north
carolina.
two
other
districts,
house
district
8
and
senate
district
2
are
no
longer
part
of
this
appeal.
the
primary
challenge
to
the
lower
court's
judgment
by
the
original
defendants
is
based
on
that
court's
interpretation
of
section
2
of
the
voting
rights
act
as
amended
in
1982.
the
court
found
infirmities
in
each
of
the
districts
that
were
challenged,
and
ultimately
fashioned
a
remedy
requiring
the
use
of
majority
black
legislative
single-member
districts
where
they
could
be
drawn,
and
in
each
of
the
multi-member
districts
as
they
were
constituted
originally,
they
largely
followed
county
lines
and
consisted
of
whole
counties.
from
this
decision
the
defendants
sought
review,
and
the
solicitor
general
joined
in
that
request.
we
ask
this
honorable
court
to
apply
section
2
of
the
voting
rights
act
so
as
to
afford
due
respect
to
the
intentions
of
the
congress
without
endorsing
the
undue
expansion
of
these
intentions
by
the
lower
courts.
we
would
encourage
a
decision
that
would
enunciate
definitive
yet
fair
and
realistic
standards
for
evaluating
the
election
practices
in
all
jurisdictions,
and
we
do
this
to
the
end
that
this
honorable
court's
determinations
might
acknowledge
the
right
of
those
jurisdictions
to
determine
their
own
electoral
affairs
so
long
as
they
neither
intentionally
or
unintentionally
deny
to
any
minority
group
the
emphatic
opportunity
to
participate
fully
and
equally
in
the
electoral
process.
we
do
so
to
the
additional
end
that
your
ruling
might
foster
political
unity
as
opposed
to
disunity
among
the
electorate.
the
panel
court
suggested
that
it
was
paying
adherence
to
the
proposition
that
no
protected
class
of
persons
has
a
constitutional
right
or
statutory
right
to
proportional
representation,
or
to
guaranteed
political
success.
but
pursuant
to
section
2,
the
court
found
that
it
had
been
shown
by
the
plaintiffs
that
north
carolina's
political
process
was
not
open
equally
to
participation
by
the
racial
minorities,
and
this
was
purportedly
based
on
the
use
of
certain
factors
that
were
denoted
by
the
senate
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
section
2
amendment.
these
factors
are
certainly
well-known
to
the
court
and
should
have
been
imported
to
the
district
court,
not
as
a
mechanical
checklist
of
conclusive
indicators,
but
rather
a
set
of
guidelines
for
determining
whether
the
characteristics
of
the
jurisdictions
being
examined
parallel
those
of
jurisdictions
examined
in
the
cases
to
which
the
senate
referred,
particularly
white
versus
regester,
whitcomb
versus
chavis,
and
zimmer
versus
mckeithen.
and,
we
submit
that
had
the
district
court
applied
these
factors
in
the
manner
intended,
giving
primary
weight
all
the
while
to
the
words
of
the
statute
and
properly
analyzing
the
cases
from
which
these
factors
came,
then
north
carolina
would
have
prevailed
in
that
court.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
i
think,
your
honor,
that
they
sought
to
apply
them
more
as
a
checklist
rather
than
as
an
indicator
of
what
actually
had
occurred,
which
leads
me
to
call
the
court's
attention--
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
--oh,
i
think
they
purported
to
apply
them
but--
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
--certainly
do.
and
we
say,
if
your
honor
please,
that
the
counties
and
the
districts
that
are
involved
in
this
case
certainly
in
no
way
can
be
equated
to
the
counties
of
fair
county
and
dallas
county
which
are
the
two
counties
in
texas
that
were
involved
in
the
white
decision.
durham
county,
north
carolina,
for
example,
with
a
28.6
percent
black
registration
has
had
proportional
representation
in
the
north
carolina
house
since
1973.
two
of
the
five
county
commissioners
are
black.
two
of
the
four
district
court
judges
are
black.
all
of
them
ran
at
large.
the
chairman
of
the
democratic
party
from
'69
to
'79
and
from
'83
to
present
is
black,
and
one
of
the
three
members
of
the
board
of
elections
from
1970
to
1981
was
black,
when
a
member
resigned
and
went
on
to
north
carolina
state
board
of
elections.
wayne
county,
with
a
15.1
percent
black
registration,
has
a
representative
serving
his
second
term.
the
sheriff
of
wayne
county,
elected
by
the
at-large
electorate,
is
black.
one
of
seven
county
commissioners,
two
of
eight
district
court
judges,
a
black
senator
from
'75
through
'78,
and
from
'77
to
the
present
a
member
of
the
board
of
elections.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
yes,
your
honor.
we
contend
that
a
lot
of
the
use
of
the
statistics
that
appear
in
this
record
involve
statewide
statistics
as
opposed
to
statistics
in
these
particular
districts.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
as
we
read
them
and
understand
them,
your
honor,
that
this--
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
--i
believe
you
use
the
words,
63.5
percent
of
the
popular
electorate.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
your
honor,
we
do
not
feel
that
the
clearly
erroneous,
the
rule
52
standards,
should
be
applied
in
this
case
to
proscribe
your
reviewing
the
facts
in
the
case.
we
contend
that
what
is
before
the
court
is
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact,
and
that
in
order
to
appropriately
determine
the
case,
you
have
to
apply...
you
have
to
look
at
the
facts
as
found
and
apply
them
as
the
law
appropriate
to
those
facts.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
we
simply
say
that
the
court
failed
to
apply
the
wording
of
the
statute
and
rather
than
taking
the
statute
which
deals
with
access
and
opportunity
to
participate
in
the
electoral
process,
clear
wording,
is
simply
found
the
various
factors
without
making
a
causal
connection
and
applied
those,
and
simply
did
not
apply
the
law,
and
fashioned
a
remedy
which
is
specifically
proscribed
by
the
statute
where
it
says
that
nothing
in
this
should
be
interpreted,
nothing
in
the
section
should
be
interpreted
to
establish
a
right
to
have
members
of
a
protected
class
elected
in
numbers
equal
to
their
proportion
in
the
population.
this
is
precisely
what
the
district
court
did
by
way
of
fashioning
a
remedy
in
this
case.
we
contend,
if
your
honor
please--
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
--yes,
we
do.
we
say
that
if
you
take
this...
take
the
statute
and
apply
it
to
these
facts,
if
your
honor
please,
that
you
come
out
with
a
different
result.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
our
contention.
and
we
contend
that
by
applying
the
law
as
the
court
did
and
by
fashioning
the
remedy
in
the
manner
in
which
it
did,
that
it
expanded
the
scope
far
beyond
the
intent
of
congress
in
the
passing
of
this
act.
these
facts,
as
found
by
the
court,
will
demonstrate
that
blacks
in
these
challenged
districts
have
run
for
office,
are
always
competitive,
and
often
win.
in
fact,
no
elected
black
incumbent
member
of
the
general
assembly
who
has
offered
for
re-election
has
ever
been
defeated.
blacks
recieve
democratic
party
support
for
their
candidacy.
they
hold
positions
of
power
and
leadership
within
the
party
structure,
and
they
have
equal
access
to
the
process
and
to
the
at-large
scheme
and
had
achieved
proportional
representation
at
the
time
of
this
trial
in
each
of
the
districts
with
the
exception
of
hecklenburg
county.
we
consider,
of
course,
that
voter
registration
as
indicated
by
the
facts
in
the
case
should
be
brought
up
to
the
court.
in
this
case,
for
'80
to
'82
statewide
registration
among
whites
decreased
by
112,000
but
increased
by
12,000
in
the
black
community.
it's
true
that
blacks
in
the
challenged
districts
fall
below
whites
in
most
of
the
socioeconomic
indicators,
but
the
electoral
success
of
the
blacks
in
these
districts
in
the
various
offices,
and
their
membership
on
the
board
of
elections
and
in
party
position
and
so
on
indicates
that
the
socioeconomic
factors
are
no
longer
an
obstacle
to
their
participation,
meaningful
participation
in
the
political
process,
and
we
suggest
that
it
defies
common
sense
to
count
these
factors
as
indicia
of
unequal
participation
when
the
direct
evidence
as
exists
in
these
districts
shows
to
the
contrary.
i
will
call
to
the
court's
attention
also
that
none
of
these
counties
is
a
section
5
county.
only
40
of
our
100
counties
are
so
covered.
the
united
states
attorney
general
required
the
creation
of
numerous
single
member
legislative
districts
in
these
counties,
and
his
determinations
were
never
contested
by
north
carolina
in
any
legal
proceeding
and
were
immediately
implemented
when
those
suggestions
were
made.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
we
would
hope
for
an
outright
reversal,
your
honor,
but
certainly
we
would...
whatever
the
court
suggested--
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
--if
it
were
to--
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
--yes,
your
honor.
we
would
of
course
appreciate
a
reversal
with
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
and
how
to
apply
it,
and
in
these
multi-member
districts,
of
course,
we
would
then
continue
with
the
multi-member
legislative
delegations
as
they
existed.
north
carolina
has
historically
placed
a
tremendous
amount
of
importance
in
our
counties
and
county
lines
and
so
on,
since
colonial
times
as
a
matter
of
fact,
and
that
was
the
primary
basis
on
which
these
various
districts
were
drawn
and
it
has
no
foundation
in
racial
tainted
motivation
of
any
kind,
the
district
courts
have
held.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
they
would...
i
believe,
if
your
honor
please,
maybe
my
colleagues
to
my
left
can
verify
it,
but
i
think
the
general
assembly
in
the
last
session
passed
a
statute
which
said
that
if
the
case
is
reversed
it
simply
goes
back
in
these
districts,
these
five
districts
that
are
under
consideration
to
the
multi-member
legislative
districts.
we
are
a
large
and
not
a
homogeneous
state
in
the
state
of
north
carolina,
and
we
feel
that
each
of
these
districts
must
be
viewed
individually
and
evaluated
individually
under
any
statute,
according
to
the
particular
characteristics
that
they
exhibit.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
we
think
the
district
court
simply
ignored
the
facts
in
the
case.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
by
ignoring
access
to
the
political
process
which
we
contend
exists,
and
the
facts
show,
it's
just
a
fundamental
error,
your
honor.
when
you
look
at
the
facts
and
apply
the
law
as
written
by
congress,
you
just
don't
have
the
facts
to
support
the
decision
that
the
district
court
made.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
that
sort
of
thing,
but
we
say,
if
you
apply
all
of
that,
given
all
of
that,
and
take
those
facts
as
found
by
the
court,
which
the
facts
that
the
court
found
are
based
on
the
record,
but
when
you
apply
the
law
to
those
facts
then
you
don't
come
out
with
the
result
that
district
court
did.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
no,
your
honor.
that's
not
what
i
intended
to
say.
that
is
just
one
of
the
indications.
we
say
that
you
have
to
look
as
the
congress
did,
in
lifting
the
white
versus
regester
language,
you
have
to
look
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
and
make
a
final
decision
based
on
all
this
and
all
of
these
access
points,
participation
points
and
so
on
that
you
have
where
blacks
are
holding
elective
offices,
where
they
hold
offices
in
party
machinery,
where
they
participate
in
the
electoral
process,
taking
all
that
into
consideration,
do
they
have
equal
access
to
the
electoral
process,
which
this
is
what
the
law
requires.
it
doesn't
place
any...
as
we
read
it,
it
doesn't
place
any
affirmative
burden
on
the
state
to
do
anything
particularly
except
to
be
certain
that
everyone,
regardless
of
race,
creed
or
color,
has
an
equal
opportunity
to
participate.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
in
the
electoral
process,
your
honor.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
let
me
quote
senator
dole
on
that.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
all
right.
the
statute
says,
a
violation
is
established
if
based
on
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
it
is
shown
that
the
political
process
or
processes
are
not
equally
open
to
participation
by
members
of
a
class
of
citizens
protected,
and
that
its
members
have
less
opportunity
than
the
members
of
the
electorate
to
participate
in
the
political
process
and
to
elect
representatives
of
their
choice.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
yes,
your
honor,
and
we
say
that
that
should
be
interpreted
so
as
to...
not
susceptible
to
the
interpretation
of
election
outcome
but
means
that
members
of
a
minority
have
a
right
to
vote,
a
right
to
register,
a
right
to
have
their
vote
fairly
counted,
and
that
north
carolina
in
these
districts
has
been
doing
that.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
certainly
racially
polarized
voting
is
important
in
the
overall
decision.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
by
virtue
of
delusions,
submergence,
or
whatever
the
effect
that
you
choose
to
attach,
which
of
course
would
occur.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
nobody
is
denied
a
vote.
the
benefit
is
so
submerged
and
subdued
and
diluted
that
it
has
no
effect.
but,
that
is
not
the
case
here.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
if
you
used
the
district
court's
interpretation,
you
could
call
it
correct.
but
what
the
district
court
interprets
polarized
voting
as,
your
honor,
was
simply
if
more
whites
vote
for
whites
and
more
blacks
vote
for
blacks,
then
you
automatically
have
polarized
voting.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
if
that
were
correct.
we
do
not
believe
it
is
correct.
and
if
i
may
save
the
remainder
of
my
time,
your
honor,
for
rebuttal.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
nothing
further,
mr.
chief
justice.
