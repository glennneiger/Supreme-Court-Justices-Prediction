mr.
attorney
general,
i
gather
that
if
you
prevail,
you
suggest
you
are
entitled
to
an
outright
reversal,
not
further
proceedings?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

well,
if
it
were
to
go
back,
if
it
were
to
go
back,
for
what
purpose?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
enough
to
say
there
had
been
an
error
made
in
the
application
of
the
law
and
that
we
should
send
it
back,
how
to
apply
it,
as
we
say?
