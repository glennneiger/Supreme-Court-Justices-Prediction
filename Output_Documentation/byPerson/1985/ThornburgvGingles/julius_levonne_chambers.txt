mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
presented
here
by
the
solicitor
general
and
by
the
state,
i
think
can
be
put
simply,
whether
the
election
of
the
five
black
candidates
in
1982
in
four
of
its
challenged
electoral
districts,
forecloses
any
possibility
for
finding
that
blacks
in
the
challenged
districts
have
been
denied
an
equal
opportunity
to
participate
in
the
electoral
process.
i
don't
think
that
anyone
would
seriously
argue
that
the
facts
in
north
carolina
prior
to
1982
would
warrant
a
finding
that
black
votes
in
each
of
the
challenged
districts
were
substantially
diluted.
and
so,
the
state
and
the
solicitor
general
now
contend
that
because
five
blacks
were
elected
in
these
challenged
districts
in
1982,
that
should
foreclose
a
determination
that
there
was
a
violation
of
section
2.
the
state
and
the
solicitor
general
asked
the
court
to
ignore
that
in
two
of
the
districts
no
black
was
ever
elected
to
the
state
house.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
to
the
state
house
of
representatives,
house
district
8
and
senate
district
2.
the
solicitor
general
and
the
state
asked
the
court
to
ignore
all
the
other
factors
that
the
district
court
looked
at,
reflect
on
the
history
of
discrimination.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
eight
is
a
multi-member
district.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
four.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
two
is
a
district
where
the
court
found
the
state
had
carved
out
a
black
residential
area
so
that
it
would
reduce
the
percentage
of
blacks
in
each
district.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
it
is
a
single
member
district,
yes.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
they
now
advise
that
they
don't
contest
those
two,
but
i
am
talking
about
the
initial
thrust
that
the
state
and
the
solicitor
general
presented,
included
those
two
and
also
included
mecklenburg
county
with
house
district
36
among
others.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
i
will
talk
about
that
right
now,
your
honor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
i
would
first
of
all,
though,
like
to
ask
the
court
to
look
at
the
plaintiff's
exhibits
4-a
through
10-b,
as
a
beginning
of
how
the
district
court
proceeded--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--i'm
sorry.
that's
in
the
plaintiff's...
or
joint
exhibit
volume
2.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
it
begins
with
plaintiff's
exhibit
4-a.
and
that
reflects
the
house
district
36.
and
the
other
exhibits
that
follow
talk
about
the
other
districts
and
have...
we
can
use
this
as
an
example.
in
house
district
36
we
have
a
substantial
concentration
of
black
voters
within
that
district
who
would
make
up,
or
should
be
able
to
affect
the
results
of,
with
respect
to
two
districts,
representatives
in
that
district.
they
would
constitute
more
than
60
percent
of
the
representative
or
the
electorate
in
those
districts.
what
the
state
has
done,
it
has
merged
these
blacks
in
a
large,
exceptionally
large
electoral
district
so
that
their
votes
are
now
reduced
from
the
60-some
percent
to
30-some
percent,
and
in
fact,
in
mecklenburg
county
less
than
30
percent.
in
that
position
they
are
not
able
to
control
of
effect
any...
determine
the
outcome
of
any
election.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
eight.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor,
prior
to
1982,
none.
in
1982,
one
person
was
elected.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
there
was
an
election
in
1984,
but
that
was
under
the
plan
directed
by
the
court.
while
i'm
on
that,
your
honor,
i
should
point
out
that
the
solicitor
has
argued
that
there
was
a
reduction
as
a
result
of
the
plan
ordered
by
the
court.
that
is
not
true.
in
fact,
in
wayne
county,
which
i
think
the
solicitor
general
is
using,
in
forsythe
county,
house
district
39,
two
blacks,
two
black
districts
were
established
as
a
result
of
the
plan
submitted
by
the
state,
and
two
black
representatives
were
elected.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct,
and
i
was...
if
you
look
at
house
district
23,
that's
reflected
in
the
plaintiff's
exhibit
6-a.
that
is
durham
county.
house
district
39
is
in
plaintiff's
exhibit
5-a,
and
house
district
21
is
in
plaintiff's
exhibit
7-a.
and
in
each
instance
we
see
a
substantial
concentration
of
blacks
who
under
normal
practices
in
this
country
would
be
able
to
affect
the
results
of
elections,
and
the
determination
of
who
would
be
their
representative.
but
when
you
merge
these
districts
together
with
the
other
factors
that
the
court
looked
at,
their
votes
are
substantially
diluted.
so
in
durham
county
where
we
had
a
black--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--in
1975
a
black
was
elected
in
house
district
39.
but
between
that
period
and
1982
there
were
some
blacks
appointed
but...
two
blacks
were
elected
in
1982,
which
the
solicitor's
general
and
the
state
used
as
the
basis
for
saying
there
could
possibly
be
no
dilution
because
in
their
position,
blacks
were
elected
in
proportions
higher
than
their
representation
in
the
community.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
you
would
have
two
districts.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
with
safe
majorities.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor,
that
is
what
i
was
just
referring...
that
is
not
the
position
that
i
think...
that
is
not
accurate.
in
house
district
39,
with
the
districts
broken
up,
two
black,
majority
black
representative
districts
were
established
by
plans
presented
by
the
state.
in
house
district
23
one
majority
black
district
was
established,
and
the
same
in
house
district
21.
but
the
other
point,
your
honor,
that
we
should
look
at
is--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--no.
we
do
not
advocate
any
further
breaking
up
of
house
district
23
or
house
district
21.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
any
more
than
the
court
approves.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
the
legislature
presented...
developed
these
plans
and
presented
them,
and
the
district
court
approved
the
plan
presented
by
the
legislature.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
they
are
in
effect
now,
and
elections
in
1984
were
conducted
under--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--by
court
order.
but
even
in
house
district
23
and
house
district
21,
blacks
were
elected
only
because
blacks
single-shot
votes,
and
in
doing
so
they
had
to
forego
any
opportunity
to
affect
the
elections
of
the
other
districts,
district
representatives.
so,
you
see,
the
concentration
of
blacks
voting
for
a
black
candidate,
unable
to
vote
for
any
other
candidate,
to
have
any
success
in
electing
a
representative.
whites
don't
have
to
look
to
blacks
for
any
support
in
those
districts.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
house
district
21
and
house
district
<twenty-three>
[=
23].
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
you
do
not,
your
honor,
but
you're
also
able
to
elect
a
representative
and
determine
the
person
who
is
representing
you.
also,
if
you
look
at
the--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--in
terms
of--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--a
black
was
elected
in
23
in
1973,
your
honor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
since
then.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
each
election
since
'73.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
in
this
multi-member
district.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
well,
two
different
blacks
were
elected,
but
only
one
black
per
term.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
you
would
not,
but
if
you
look
at--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--one
black
was
elected
to
the
state
house
for
the
first
time
in
1980.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
and
since.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
there
was
a
black
elected.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
under
the
court
plan.
under
the
multi-member
districts--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--yes.
a
black
was
elected
in
'39,
in
1975,
and
1977,
i
believe.
no
black
was
elected
in
1978,
although
a
black
who
had
been
appointed
ran
and
was
defeated.
a
black
ran
in
1980
who
also
was...
had
been
appointed
and
was
running
for
re-election
and
was
defeated.
two
blacks
were
elected
in
1982,
and
as
the
district
court
found,
looking
at
the
substantial
block,
racially
block
voting,
the
success
of
candidates
in
each
of
these
elections
was
substantially
adversely
affected
by
the
way
whites
refused
to
support
any
black
candidate.
in
each
district,
your
honor,
more
than
81
percent
of
the
whites...
well,
on
an
average
more
than
81
percent
of
the
whites
refused
to
support
any
black
candidate
in
the
primaries.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor,
i
think
polarized
voting
here
is
important.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor,
recently
the
structural
barriers
to
registration
had
been
removed.
historically
there
had
been
problems,
but
the
district
court
found
more
recently,
those
barriers
had
been
removed.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
those
barriers--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--the
barriers
that
had
been
in
effect
previously
continue
to
affect
the
ability
of
blacks
to--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--well,
first
of
all
you
have
a
problem
of
registration.
blacks
still
were
under-represented
in
registration
as
compared
with
whites.
there
was
a
problem
of
large
multi-member
districts
that
cost
on
an
average
twice
as
much
as
running
in
a
single
member
district,
and
with
the
problems
that
blacks
had
and
their
economic
condition,
they
weren't
able
to
support
a
candidate.
blacks
were
segregated
residentially
and
didn't
have
access
to
whites.
so,
the
historical
practices
that
existed
previously
continued
to
affect
the
ability
of
blacks
in
23
and
21
as
well
as
39
and
the
other
districts
looked
at,
to
participate
equally,
and
certainly
in
their
ability
to
elect
representatives
of
their
choice.
so,
looking
at
the
facts
overall,
at
the
totality
of
circumstances
that
the
district
court
was
directed
to
review,
even
with
the
1982
election,
blacks
were
substantially
affected
in
their
ability
to
participate
and
to
elect
representatives
of
their
choice.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
well,
i
was
going
to
turn
to
that,
your
honor.
in
polarized
voting,
the
district
court
proceeded
to
analyze
what
happened
there
in
two
steps,
which
is
proper.
first
it
looked
to
determine
whether
blacks
and
whites
in
fact
voted
differently,
and
they
in
fact
do.
second,
it
then
proceeded
to
determine,
as
the
congress
had
directed
it
to--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
in
north
carolina.
it
then
looked
at
the
extent
to
which
blacks
and
whites
voted
differently.
what
the
solicitor
general
and
the
state
have
done
is,
they
have
taken
the
first
step
and
said,
that's
the
court's
definition
for
severe
polarized
voting.
i
ask
you
to
just
look
at
the
district
court's
opinion,
and
you'll
see
how
the
state
and
the
solicitor
general
have
misread
that
opinion,
because
after
looking
at
whether
black
and
whites
vote
differently,
the
court
then
looked
at
basically
three
other
things.
historically,
over
81
percent
of
whites
have
refused
or
failed
to
vote
for
black
candidates
in
the
primaries.
historically
on
an
average
60-some
percent
of
whites
refused
to
vote
for
a
black
candidate
when
the
black
is
nominated.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
we
looked
at
elections
from
1978
through
1982.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
even
where
a
black
is
nominated
by
his
party,
then,
whites
failed
to
vote
for
black
candidates.
so
in
forsythe
county,
house
district
39,
black
candidates
are
nominated
by
the
democratic
party
and
yet
defeated
by
whites
refusing
or
failing
to
vote
for
black
democratic
candidates.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
yes.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
there
is
a
majority
of
democrats.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
in
forsythe
county.
and
so,
the
standard
that
the
district
court
followed
in
determining
whether
racially
polarized
voting
existed
was
consistent
with
what
congress
had
directed.
the
court
also
looked
at
another
factor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor,
that
was
not
considered
necessary
by
the
district
court
and
i
think
appropriately,
because
congress
had
eliminated
the
necessity
for
determining
whether
intent
existed.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor,
here...
i'm
sorry...
here
the
district
court
did
patiently
look
at
the
success
of
black
candidates
in
1982
and
before,
and
the
way
that
whites
voted,
first
to
come
to
a
determination
that
there
was
severe
and
significant
racial
block
voting,
and
second,
to
determine
whether
1982
was
an
aberration
from
what
the
pattern
was.
there
was
a
very
intense
analysis
of
those
factors
for
the
court
to
arrive
at
that
decision.
the
court
also
looked
at
racial
appeals.
in
1983
senator
helms
is
still
presenting
racial
appeals,
like
the
racial
appeals
we
faced
in
1890.
so,
looking
at
north
carolina
overall,
we
do
have
a
factual
situation
very
similar
to
those
this
court
considered
in
white
versus
regester,
and
i
think
a
much
more
appealing
case
than
white
versus
regester,
and
the
other
cases
which
have
followed
it,
because
we
have
substantial
racial
block
voting.
we
have
substantial
racial
appeal.
we
have
substantial
submergence
of
black
in
each
of
the
districts,
district
23,
21,
<thirty-nine>
[=
39]
as
well
as
the
others,
and
we
have
all
the
factors
that
make
for
dilution
of
black
votes.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor,
first
there
were
two
statistical
analyses.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
looking
at
the
composition
of
districts.
if
whites
constitute
95
percent
of
a
district,
looking
at
census
tracts
for
example,
and
if
a
candidate,
white
candidate
receives
95
percent
of
those
votes,
statisticians
determine
that
that
candidate
is
receiving
95
percent
of
the
white
votes
of
that
district.
and
if
you
look
at
a
racially
mixed
district,
and
whites
constitute
a
certain
percentage
of
the
residents
of
that
district,
and
white
candidates
receive
a
certain
percentage
of
the
vote,
then
there
is
a
statistical
determination
that
whites
vote
for
white
candidates
in
that
particular
percentage,
and
the
same
with
respect
to
blacks
in
the
district.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
they
are
statistics.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
voting
is
secret.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
fortunately
it's
still
secret
in
north
carolina.
yet,
one
can
make
a
determination
that
whites
have
supported
a
candidate
in
certain
percentages
and
blacks
in
another.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
well--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--i
think
officially,
your
honor,
the
most
recent
effort
was
in
1970.
there
were
still
problems,
as
i
understand
it,
of
blacks
having
to
pass
a
literacy
test
in
some
districts.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
yes.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor,
you're
looking
at
house
district
39?
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
okay,
it's
23.
well,
we'll
look
at
23.
we
have
presented
here
all
of
the
residents...
the
residences
of
all
of
the
elected
officials
since
1978.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
no,
no,
all
the
house
of
representatives
members
and
the
senatorial
members.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
'78,
we're
talking
about
all
of
the
people
who
were
elected.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
more
than
one
term
of
office.
so,
what
we
are
depicting
here
is
that
with
multi-member
districts,
blacks
have
limited
accessibility
to
the
representatives.
as
you
see
here,
the
representatives
are
all
outside
the
black
residential
areas.
and
that's
true
in
house
district
36
as
well
as
house
district
23.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that
is
possible,
your
honor.
what
we
are
talking
about,
though,
is
the
ability
of
blacks
to
relate
to
their
representatives,
to
insure
that
those
representatives
are
accountable
for
the
way
that
they
represent
the
interests
of
blacks.
where
they
live
outside
the
district,
they
first
of
all
are
not
accessible,
and
where
blacks
have
to
depend
on
white
votes
to
elect
representatives,
they
aren't
necessarily
accountable
to
the
black
community.
we
have
testimony
in
the
record
how
these
multi-member
districts
affect
the
ability
of
blacks
to
protect
and
advance
their
own
interests,
and
these
are
factors
again,
looking
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
that
the
district
court
looked
at
very
intensely
to
determine
whether
vote
dilution
in
fact
occurred.
also,
if
you
look...
the
defendants
asked
the
court
to
not
apply
rule
52
in
this
particular
instance.
i
think
that
rule
52
controls
the
determination
here,
and
i
think
is
extremely
important.
first
if
we
look
at
the
fact,
we
have
three
native
north
carolinians
who
sat
on
this
case.
they
knew
the
facts
in
north
carolina.
prior
to
their
appointment
to
the
bench
they
had
actively
participated
in
politics
in
north
carolina.
one
had
served
as
a
dean
of
a
law
school.
and
then
they
looked
very
closely
at
whether
there
was
a
real
opportunity
for
blacks
to
participate
in
each
district,
and
we
have
then
a
careful,
intense
analysis
by
three
native
north
carolinians
of
what
has
taken
place
is
each
district
including
the
1982
election,
affecting
the
ability
of
blacks
to
participate
equally
and
to
elect
representatives
of
their
choice.
even
in
house
district
23,
where
a
black
was
elected
since
1973,
blacks
had
to
make
sure
that
the
candidate
running
was
someone
who
could
appeal
to
white
residents
because
white
votes
were
necessary
for
the
black
to
be
elected.
it
was
not
possible
for
blacks
to
get
a
person
elected
without
extreme
single-shot
voting,
and
a
candidate
who
could
appeal
at
least
to
a
limited
number
of
whites.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
house
district
23,
and
that's
true
as
well
in
house
district
21.
so,
even
in
the
three
districts
that
the
solicitor
general
has
referred
to,
as
well
as
the
state,
blacks
do
not
have
and
have
not
had
an
equal
opportunity
to
participate
in
the
electoral
process
and
to
elect
representatives
of
their
choice.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor,
that
is
correct,
but
you
are
still
able
to
ensure
that
you
can
determine
the
outcome
of
that
candidate,
you
can
ensure
that
that
candidate
is
accessible
and
accountable,
and
that
is
what
congress
was
trying
to
obtain
with
the
amended
section
2,
to
make
sure
that
blacks
have
an
equal
opportunity
to
participate
with
whites
in
the
election.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
think
that--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
would
think
that
under
this
court's
decision
in
anderson
versus
bessemer
city,
that
rule
52
governs
the
factual
determination
as
well
as
the
ultimate--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--your
honor,
i
think
that
the
court
has
already
determined--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--the
definition
may
be
a
legal
question.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
well,
i
think
that
both
the
state
and
solicitor
general
are...
about
the
factual
determination,
whether
there
was
in
fact
substantial
polarized
voting.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct,
your
honor.
