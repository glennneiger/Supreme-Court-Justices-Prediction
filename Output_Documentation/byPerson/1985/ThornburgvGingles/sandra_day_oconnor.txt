justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--general
thornburg,
is
it
your
position
that
the
court
below
was
required
to
focus
on
the
individual
election
districts
rather
than
the
state
as
a
whole?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
the
precedents,
do
the
cases
from
this
court
indicate
that
that
is
a
requirement?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
you
look
at
the
individual--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
do
we
have
to
apply
a
clearly
erroneous
standard
to
the
review
of
the
factors
found
by
the
court
below?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
specifically,
what
are
the
legal
errors
that
you
believe
were
made
below?
