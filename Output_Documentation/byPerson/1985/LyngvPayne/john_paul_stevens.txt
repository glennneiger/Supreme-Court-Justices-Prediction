justice
stevens
mr.
kuhlik,
can
i
ask
you
right
there,
one
of
the
things
that
is
troubling
about
the
case
is
its
age.
it
is
such
an
old
case
and
i
guess
it
took
about
five
years
just
to
get
to
trial
even
which
is
kind
of
puzzling
to
me,
but,
anyway,
supposing
the
case
had
been
brought
promptly,
within
30
days
after
the
deadline,
they
just
discovered
it
and
so
forth.
would
your
position
be
basically
the
same?
justice
stevens
missed
by
a
couple
of
days
and
said
they
didn't
know
what--
justice
stevens
--there
is
really
no
remedy.
it
is
not
a
question
of
what
the
appropriate
remedy,
there
just
simply
isn't
any
remedy
for
this
particular
violation.
justice
stevens
you
wouldn't
have
to
bring
the
lawsuit
if
they
were
ahead
of
the
deadline.
they
could
have
just
filed
for
the
loans,
i
suppose.
justice
stevens
well,
for
the
purpose
of
this
argument,
are
you
conceding
there
was
a
violation
or
are
you
arguing
in
the
alternative,
there
was
no
violation
anyway?
justice
stevens
well,
assume
with
me
just
for
the
moment,
because
apparently
the
lower
courts
disagreed
with
you
on
that.
assume
for
a
moment
there
had
been
a
violation,
just
to
get
into
this
whole
estoppel
problem,
would
you
then
take
the
position
that
there
was
still
no
remedy?
justice
stevens
well,
of
any
kind.
would
there
be--
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
whether
you
would
take
the
same
position
if
the
regulation
had
not
been
published
in
the
federal
register,
had
just
been
put
in
somebody's
desk
drawer
and
nobody
had
access
to
it?
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
what
i
want
to
know
is
the
only
defect
would
be
a
total
failure
to
make
it
possible
for
anyone
to
know
about
the
regulation.
justice
stevens
why
not?
justice
stevens
i
am
assuming
no
publicity
at
all.
justice
stevens
that
you
have
the
same
practical
consequences
that
your
opponents
contend
happened...
i
know
you
disagree...
but
that
they
also
really
had
no
possible
means
of
getting
access
to
the
information.
justice
stevens
let
me
be
sure
i
understand.
you
say
as
long
as
the
deadline
is
published.
do
the
terms
of
the
loan
program
also
have
to
be
published
to
satisfy
your
position?
justice
stevens
but,
if
so,
there
is
just
a
statement
in
the
federal
register
that
loan
program
number
xyz
expires
on
such
and
such
a
date
without
telling
anybody
what
loan
program
xyz
is,
that
would
be
sufficient
to
protect
the
government
from
liability.
justice
stevens
why
do
you
suppose
they
didn't?
