mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
requires
the
farmers
home
administration
to
reopen
and
accept
applications
now
for
an
emergency
loan
program
intended
to
tide
farmers
over
the
immediate
difficulties
posed
by
heavy
rains
in
north
florida
in
1973.
such
a
result
is
wholly
inconsistent
with
the
purpose
of
the
emergency
loan
program
which
was
to
enable
farmers
to
make
good
their
losses
on
crops
that
were
damaged
at
that
time
and
then
to
resume
their
operations
with
regular
credit
from
other
sources.
the
loan
program
provided
substantial
government
benefits,
including
an
outright
grant
of
$5,000
to
each
farmer
at
an
interest
rate
of
one
percent.
these
funds,
however,
could
not
be
used
to
produce
new
crops
in
1974
or
subsequent
years,
but
only
to
reimburse
farmers
for
their
1973
losses
so
that
they
could
remain
in
business
at
that
time.
at
this
late
date,
the
relief
ordered
by
the
court
of
appeals
would
amount
to
a
government
give-away
to
persons
who
could
not
reasonably
have
unmet
needs
from
so
long
ago.
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
insupportable.
it
bars
the
agency
from
enforcing
a
valid
regulation
that
established
april
2,
1974
as
the
deadline
for
applying
for
these
loans.
that
result
conflicts
with
this
court's
many
cases
that
forbid
application
of
estoppel
against
the
government,
at
least
absent
extraordinary
circumstances
that
are
not
present
here.
moreover,
the
basis
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision
that
the
agency
violated
a
self-imposed
obligation
to
publicize
the
loan
program
is
plainly
wrong.
finally,
neither
this
purported
violation
nor
the
violations
found
by
the
district
court
could
support
an
application
of
estoppel
in
this
case,
especially
on
the
classified
basis
ordered
by
the
courts
below.
heavy
rains
struck
north
florida
in
early
april
of
1973.
the
area
was
declared
a
disaster
area
a
short
time
later
which
allowed
farmers
to
apply
for
emergency
loans
from
a
number
of
government
agencies,
including
the
fmha,
the
small
business
administration.
at
the
time
fmha
loans
carried
an
interest
rate
of
five
percent.
it
could
only
be
made
to
farmers
who
were
unable
to
obtain
credit
elsewhere
and
they
carried
no
forgiveness
principal,
no
grant
aspect
to
the
loans.
loans
from
the
sba,
on
the
other
hand,
carried
an
interest
rate
of
one
percent,
included
a
substantial
forgiveness
of
principal,
and
could
be
made
without
a
showing
of
unavailability
of
credit
elsewhere.
during
the
time
that
the
initial
application
period
was
open
for
these
loans,
a
number
of
farmers
obtained
sba
emergency
loans,
they
obtained
regular,
operating
loans
from
the
fmha.
in
january
1974,
however,
congress
passed
public
law
93-237,
which
included
a
grandfather
clause
extending
the
favorable
terms
that
were
previously
available
from
the
sba,
and
also
had
been
available
from
the
fmha
for
earlier
disasters,
to
disasters
up
through
april
20,
1973,
a
time
period
that
included
the
north
florida
flooding
that
is
at
issue
in
this
case.
at
the
time,
in
the
statute,
the
congress
directed
the
secretary
of
agriculture
to
extend
for
90
days
the
application
period
for
applying
for
loans
under
this
new,
more
favorable
emergency
loan
program.
accordingly,
the
secretary
promulgated
a
regulation
establishing
april
2,
1974
as
the
deadline
for
applying
for
emergency
loans
under
this
program.
the
deadline
was
published
in
the
federal
register.
at
the
same
time,
the
secretary
also
promulgated
a
regulation
providing
that
publicity
of
the
provisions
of
public
law
93-237
would
be
provided
to
the
local
news
media
and
when
he
issued
the
staff
instruction
that
first
embodied
this
requirement,
the
secretary
issued
to
the
state
fmha
officials
a
sample
press
release
to
be
distributed
to
the
local
media.
in
fact,
in
this
case,
that
sample
press
release
was
distributed
to
the
state
fmha
officials
and
by
them
to
the
local
county
fmha
officials.
it
was
forwarded
by
the
local
officials
to
the
local
media.
it
was,
in
fact,
carried
in
at
least
two
local
newspapers.
respondent
filed
this
lawsuit
in
august
of
1976,
well
over
two
years
after
the
expiration
of
the
application
deadline.
with
the
exception
of
the
name
class
representative
and
a
few
other
farmers,
no
class
member
had
applied
for
a
loan,
either
before
or
after
expiration
of
the
loan
application
deadline.
all
of
the
persons
who
had,
in
fact,
applied
for
loans
had
done
so
before
the
deadline
and
had
received
emergency
loans
under
the
program.
following
a
bench
trial
in
1981,
the
district
court
order
the
secretary
to
reopen
the
loan
program
and
to
accept
applications
at
that
time
without
regard
to
their
untimeliness
under
the
april
2,
1974
deadline.
reaching
this
conclusion,
the
district
court
relied
primarily
on
publicity
that
was
given...
or
lack
of
publicity
that
was
given
to
the
earlier,
less
favorable
loan
program,
and
in
particular
the
district
court
relied
on
section
1832.3
of
the
regulations
which
provided
that
the
secretary
would
make
such
public
announcements
as
appear
to
be
appropriate.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed,
though
it
did
not
rely
on
that
regulation
but
a
later
one,
the
one
that
provided
the
fmha
would
inform
the
news
media
of
public
law
93-237.
reaching
the
conclusion
that
the
fmha
violated
this
regulation,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
consider
the
fact
that
the
sample
press
release
that
had
accompanied
the
regulation
was,
in
fact,
distributed
to
the
local
news
media.
the
court
of
appeals
distinguished
this
court's
decision
in
schweiker
versus
hansen
which
the
court
had
refused
to
allow
an
estoppel
against
the
government
on
the
ground
primarily
that
this
case
does
not
involve
an
adverse
impact
on
the
public
fist.
in
reaching
this
conclusion,
the
court
of
appeals
failed
to
consider
the
$5,000
grant
aspect
of
the
loan
program
and
the
below-market
interest
rate
of
one
percent
that
accompanied
the
loans.
we
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
wrong
for
a
number
of
independent
reasons.
we
would
point
out
that
the
fundamental
error
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
that
it
failed
to
recognize
the
limitations
that
sovereign
immunity
places
on
judicial
remedies
for
alleged
governmental
wrongdoing.
it
is
quite
clear
the
courts,
once
they
find
a
violation
of
some
regulation
or
other
provision
by
government
personnel,
are
not
free
to
roam
at
will
and
impose
whatever
remedies
they
feel
are
equitable
against
the
government.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
if
the
lawsuit
were
brought
after
the
expiration
of
the
loan
application--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--our
position
would
be
that
the
courts
did
not
have
authority
to
set
aside
the
deadline.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
for
this
particular
violation,
given
the
failure
of
the
respondent
class
to
bring
the
lawsuit
before
the
expiration
of
the
deadline--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--of
course.
but,
if
they
intended
to
enforce
the
publicity
regulation...
the
problem
is...
the
violation
that
the
court
of
appeals
fastened
on,
failure
to
give
adequate
publicity,
is
simply
not
a
pre-requisite
in
any
sense
to
the
application
of
the
loan
application
deadline.
if
the
secretary's
regulation
had
provided
that
the
application
period
would
expire
30
days
after
the
presentation
of
sufficient
publicity
in
the
local
news
media,
it
would
be
a
completely
different
case.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
we
are
most
certainly
not
conceding
that
there
has
been
a
violation.
in
fact,
that
was
the
point
i
just
intended
to
make.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
that
there
was
still
no
remedy
of
this
estoppel
like
nature,
that
is
correct.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
of
any
kind,
that
is
correct
at
this
point
in
time.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
though
there
is--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--justice
powell,
the
press
release
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
referring
to
here
on
page
7-a
is
not
the
press
release
that
it
found
insufficiently
informative
later.
this
was
a
press
release
that
had
to
deal
with
the
initial
less
favorable
loan
period
and--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--we
think
it
completely
clear
from
the
record.
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
fmha
did
comply--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--there
were
no
findings
made
by
the
district
court
with
respect
to
whether
any
individual
class
member
did
or
did
not
have
notice.
the
only
farmers
that
we
know
about,
in
fact,
are
the
named
representative
and
the
other
farmers
who
did
have
a
notice.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
it
is
true
that
very
few
applications
were
made,
however,
we
don't
believe
the
reasons
for
that
are
relevant.
i
think
that
it
is
clear
from
the
record
that
during
the
initial
loan
application
period
the
loan
terms
were
simply
were
not
sufficiently
favorable
to
attract
enough
farmers.
they
went
to
the
sba
to
obtain
the
loans
that
were
available
from
that
agency
for
physical
losses
and
they
determined
to
use
regular
operating
loans
which
were
not
in
any
real
relevant
respect
less
favorable
than
the
emergency
loans
at
that
time.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
that
is
right.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
we
do
not
believe
that
it
could
be.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
that
is
right.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
statute,
public
law
93-237,
that
established
these
favorable
loan
terms
made
no
mention
of
publicity
whatsoever.
and,
the
fmha...
the
secretary
determined
to
provide
a
certain
quantum
of
publicity
and
that
publicity
is
stated
in
the
sample
press
release
which
is
at
pages
50
to
51-a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
and,
that
sample
press
release
did
specify
the
loan
application
deadline.
it
was
forwarded
to
the
news
media.
and,
i
submit
that
this
sample
press
release
constitutes
a
contemporaneous
construction
of
the
regulations
by
the
agency
that
promulgated
them
and
that
there
were
was
no
warrant
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
suppose
that
there
had
been
a
violation
of
this
regulation.
we
would
also
note
that
without
reaching
the
main
estoppel
question
in
the
case
that
there
can
be
no
estoppel
here
because
there
has
not
been
an
adequate
showing
of
reasonable
reliance,
certainly
not
on
behalf
of
the
class
as
a
whole
nor
on
behalf
of
any
individual
class
member.
the
fact
is
that
regardless
of
whether
or
not
this
particular
press
release
could
have
said
more
it
did
make
clear
the
key
fact
that
there
was
a
new
emergency
loan
program.
it
was
up
to
farmers
to
make
further
inquiries
if
they
needed
emergency
credit
under
the
terms
of
that
program.
and,
moreover
and
perhaps
more
fundamentally,
the
complete
terms
of
the
emergency
loan
program
were
published
in
full
in
the
federal
register.
and,
as
this
court's
cases
such
as
community
health
services
and
federal
crop
insurance
corporation
against
merrill
make
clear
one
cannot
support
an
estoppel
against
the
government
in
a
case
where
the
true
facts
are
there
for
the
reading
in
the
federal
register
of
the
statutes
at
large.
most
fundamentally,
the
court
of
appeals
decision
clearly
conflicts
with
this
court's
many
cases
establishing
that
the
government
cannot
be
estopped
from
enforcing
a
valid
statutory
or
regulatory
condition
of
the
receipt
of
public
benefits.
it
is
exactly
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
here
whether
it
was
willing
to
admit
it
or
not.
it
has
barred
the
government
from
enforcing
a
valid
regulatory
deadline
that
was
promulgated
pursuant
to
the
secretary's
substantive
rulemaking
authority
and
has
not
been
suggested
by
respondents
or
any
court
that
that
regulation
was
defectively
promulgated.
the
court
of
appeals
has
barred
us
from
enforcing
that
deadline
on
the
basis
of
alleged
misconduct
by
governmental
agents
and
that
is
an
estoppel
and
that
is
what
this
court's
cases
plainly
make
clear
simply
cannot
be
done.
the
court
of
appeals
gave
a
number
of
reason
for
disregarding
this
court's
estoppel
cases,
but
in
our
view,
none
of
them
are
substantial.
for
example,
the
court
of
appeals
on
remand
from
this
court
purported
to
draw
a
distinction
between
acts
and
failures
to
act
which
we
believe
is
irrelevant,
and,
similarly,
the
distinction
between
the
fault
of
one
employee
and
several
also
are
irrelevant
under
this
court's
cases.
the
court
of
appeals
purported
to
rely
quite
heavily
on
the
accardi
doctrine,
that
agencies
must
follow
their
own
regulations.
we
would
submit,
however,
the
doctrine
is
irrelevant
for
the
following
reasons:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
not
whether
an
agency
must
follow
its
procedures.
of
course,
it
should.
the
question
is
what
remedies
are
available
when
an
agency
has
not
followed
its
procedures.
and,
in
all
of
the
accardi
line
of
cases,
the
court
invalidated
agency
action
whose
validity
depended
on
following
the
precise
procedure
that
was
found
to
have
been
violated.
it
was
for
simply
a
matter
of
logic
quite
a
short
step
to
say
that
the
ultimate
agency
action
was
invalid.
but,
here,
as
i
was
mentioning
earlier,
the
substantive
validity
of
the
loan
application
deadline
was
not
made
to
depend
in
any
way
on
the
quantum
of
publicity
that
was
given
by
the
agency
or
in
compliance
with
the
regulation
that
established...
compliance
with
the
regulation
that
provided
for
publicity
in
the
local
news
media.
i
think
it
is
quite
clear
under
the
court's
estoppel
cases
that
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
well-established
notions
of
sovereign
immunity
to
deny
a
valid
legal
defense
to
the
government
based
only
on
the
court's
own
notions
of
what
would
be
equitable
in
a
particular
case.
the
court
of
appeals
also--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--the
application
deadline
regulation?
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
i
am
not
sure
whether
we
would.
if
it
had
been
a
regulation
that
was
established
by
the
secretary
in
a
way
that
substantively
provided--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--in
those
circumstances,
the
application
deadline
would
not
be
valid
under
the
apa,
i
don't
believe.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
well,
if
the
apa
provided
that
the
application
deadline
would
have
to
be
published
in
the
federal
register
on
pain
of
it
not
being
enforceable
against
persons
without
actual
knowledge
of
the
regulation,
then
it
would
not
be
enforceable
except
as
to
those
people
who
had
knowledge
of
it.
if
it
were
contained
in
an
internal
staff
instruction
that
were
then
publicized,
i
think
that
those--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--if
there
were
no
publicity
at
all--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--i
believe
under
the
circumstances
that
you
are
stating,
justice
stevens,
that
there
would
not
be
an
estoppel
problem
because
that
regulation
or
that
internal
instruction
would
not
be
enforceable.
the
point
is
the
regulation
here
was
published.
it
was
published
in
the
exact
place
it
was
supposed
to
be
published
which
was
the
federal
register.
it
was
promulgated
as
a
binding
regulation
pursuant
to
the
secretary's
rulemaking
authority.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
my
answer
is
that
if
the
application
deadline
is
published
in
the
federal
register,
then
there
is
no
requirement
that
the
government
give
additional--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--that
is
right.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
if
there
were
no...
if
the
regulation--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--if
the
loan
application
deadline
were
not
published
in
the
manner
necessary
for
it
to
be
a
binding
regulation,
then
there
wouldn't
be
an
estoppel
question.
it
would
be
a
binding
rule.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
i
doubt
very
much
that
any
of
them
do.
there
is
two
different
kinds
of
notice
here
though
that
it
is
important
to
separate.
there
is
notice
of
the
application
deadline
which
we
contend,
as
long
as
that
was
provided
in
the
federal
register,
and,
therefore,
as
long
as
the
loan
application
deadline
was
properly
promulgated
under
the
apa,
as
long
as
that
notice
was
given,
then
that
deadline
is
a
valid
legal
requirement
that
cannot
be
set
aside
by
the
courts.
the
separate
question
is
the
notice
of
the
loan
program
as
a
whole
and
we
would
simply
submit,
as
i
have
been
saying,
that
the
amount
of
publicity
given
to
that
governmental
program
is
simply
irrelevant
to
whether
the
government
can
enforce
the
application
deadline.
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--i
don't
believe
they
do.
in
fact,
they
were
published
though
in
this
case.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
i
believe
it
would.
of
course,
here
we
are
talking
about
an
emergency
loan
program.
the
fact
is
if
the
farmers
had
emergency
credit
needs,
one
would
have
expected
them
to
go
to
the
fmha
and
make
adequate
inquiries
without
waiting
to
determining
whether
the
terms
amounted
to--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--well,
i
think
the
record
shows
a
couple
of
things.
first,
that
the
emergency
did
not
turn
out
to
be
as
serious
as
people
expected
originally.
it
also
shows
again
that
the
original
fmha
loan
terms
were
simply
not
all
that
favorable
and
that
people
went
to
other
sources
to
obtain
loans
and
by
the
time
that
this
program
was
reopened
in
early
1974
with
more
favorable
terms,
very
few
people
had
emergency
credit
needs
at
that
point.
but,
again,
that
question,
we
believe,
is
irrelevant
to
the
determination
of
this
case.
finally,
the
court
of
appeals
attempted
to
seek
support
for
its
decision
under
the
apa.
they
suggested,
i
believe,
that
the
regulation
could
be
waived
and
that
it
would
be
reasonable
to
do
so
here.
the
point
isn't
whether...
if
this
regulation
were
waivable,
the
point
would
not
be
whether
the
court's
own
notion
of
equity
supported
a
waiver
in
this
case,
but
whether
a
failure
to
waive
would
be
arbitrary
and
capricious.
and,
we
would
submit
that
given
the
emergency
nature
of
the
loan
program,
that
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
basis
for
reaching
such
a
conclusion
here.
but,
moreover,
this
is
not
a
waivable
regulation.
there
is
nothing
in
the
regulation
to
suggest
that
it
is.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
that
is
the
conclusion
the
court
of
appeals
reached
and
we
are
not
challenging
that
here.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
there
was
no
mention
of
publicity
in
the
statute.
the
fact
is
this
is
not
a
waivable
regulation.
the
secretary
has
long
taken
the
position
that
this
sort
of
regulation
cannot
be
waived
administratively
under
any
circumstances.
we
would
submit
that
that
provides
a
further
reason
why
the
court
of
appeals
could
not
rely
on
the
apa
to
require
a
waiver
in
this
case.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
at
this
time,
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
submit
that
respondents'
answer
to
justice
white's
question
decides
this
case.
respondents
admit
that
if
this
were
a
statutory
deadline
there
would
be
no
authority
for
a
court
to
override
it.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
this
was
a
properly
promulgated
regulatory
deadline
that
was
recognized
by
the
court
of
appeals
as
a
legitimate
time
restriction.
this
court's
many
cases
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
its
estoppel
cases
as
well
make
very
clear
the
regulations
that
are
promulgated
in
accordance
with
the
apa
have
the
force
and
effect
of
law
just
as
if
they
were
statutory
eligibility
requirements.
that
is
language
directly
from
the
court's
opinion
in
merrill.
there
is
simply
no
basis
for
overriding
the
regulatory
application
deadline--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--no,
we
are
not,
but
the
fact
is
that
they
are
the
same
thing.
there
is
no
ground
for
treating
them
any
differently.
i
would
like
to
return
to
some
questions
that
were
asked
earlier
by
justice
powell
and
justice
stevens
concerning
the
publicity
of
the
program.
there
is
no
requirement
under
the
apa
or
in
any
statute
that
as
a
matter
of
law
publicity
must
be
given
of
governmental
benefit
programs
just
in
general.
there
is
certainly
no
requirement
that
that
publicity
be
given
as
a
pre-condition
to
the
validity
of
an
application
deadline.
there
was
a
regulation
here
that
provided
that
the
agency
would
give
publicity,
but
it
did
not
specify
nor
did
the
application
deadline
specify
that
the
loan
application
deadline
would
depend
on
the
amount
of
publicity
that
was
given.
i
think
it
is
very
clear
that
if
the
publicity
regulation
had
said
the
agency
will
inform
the
news
media
of
this
loan
program,
but
its
failure
to
do
so
shall
not
in
any
way
affect
the
validity
of
the
loan
application
deadline.
i
can't
believe
that
we
would
be
here.
it
would
be
clear
that
the
loan
application
deadline
would
be
effective.
but,
that
is
exactly
the
same
as
this
case.
there
is
nothing
in
the
regulations,
nothing
in
the
statute
at
all
which
even
speaks
publicity
that
would
in
any
way
suggest
that
the
validity
of
the
loan
application
deadline
somehow
depended
on
whether
this
regulation
concerning
publicity
was
followed.
we
would
suggest
that
that
is
enough
to
decide
the
case.
if
there
is
nothing
further,
thank
you.
