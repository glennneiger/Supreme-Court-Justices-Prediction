justice
jr.
--before
you
go
ahead,
may
i
follow
up
on
the
questions
that
justice
stevens
had
asked?
at
the
bottom
of
page
7-a
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
the
court
of
appeals,
and
it
is
a
good
court
of
appeals,
states
as
a
fact
that
apart
from
other
problems
with
the
notice
to
the
farmers,
that
the
release
totally
omitted
any
reference
to
the
nine-month
period
that
expired
february
26,
1974.
the
release
was
routinely
forwarded
to
the
local
media.
however,
county
officials
made
no
follow
up
to
determine
whether
the
press
release
was
ever
published.
but,
if
if
didn't
give
the
date
as
to
when
the
right
to
apply
for
loans
existed,
how
did
the
farmers
get
notice
of
their
right
to
apply
for
loans.
justice
jr.
is
it
clear
from
the
record
that
the
farmers
had
adequate
notice?
justice
jr.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
did
they
have
notice.
if
you
had
been
a
farmer
down
there,
would
you
have
known
about
this?
justice
jr.
is
it
not
a
fact
that
very
few
applications
were
made?
justice
jr.
so,
even
though
the
government
concluded
that
in
view
of
the
situation
additional
loans
could
be
made,
for
whatever
reason,
very
few
people
applied
for
them?
justice
jr.
may
i
ask
this
question?
if
the
notice
had
been
wholly
inadequate,
would
the
government
be
estopped?
justice
jr.
in
other
words,
your
position
is
that
if
no
notice
whatever
was
given,
there
could
be
no
estoppel.
justice
jr.
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
do
understand.
you
have
responded
to
one
of
my
questions
by
saying
that
if
there
had
been
no
notice
of
any
kind,
there
would
still
be
no
estoppel
against
the
government.
that
was
the
same
answer
you
have
just
given
justice
stevens.
justice
jr.
then
you
are
saying
it
had
to
be
published
in
the
federal
register?
justice
jr.
if
not,
the
government
would
not
be
estopped.
justice
jr.
if
not
published,
the
government
would
be
estopped.
justice
jr.
you
are
saying
the
notice
itself
is
irrelevant.
do
you
think
many
farmers
read
the
federal
register?
