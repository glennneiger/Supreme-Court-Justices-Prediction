justice
rehnquist
mr.
kuhlik,
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
the
deadline
was
an
administratively
imposed
one,
not
one
imposed
by
statute?
justice
rehnquist
and,
am
i
also
right
in
thinking
that
any
requirement
for
publicity
was
also
an
administrative
requirement,
not
one
in
the
statute?
justice
rehnquist
is
there
something
in
the
legislative
history
or
the
statute
itself
that
leads
you
to
the
conclusion
that
the
congress
knew
about
the
existence
of
this
regulation?
justice
rehnquist
at
least
congress
sanctioned
the
closing
of
the
loans
after
the
90-day
extension.
justice
rehnquist
and
was
satisfied
with
the
90-day
extension.
justice
rehnquist
and,
was
there
later
word
from
congress
that
it
was
unhappy?
you
say
"at
that
time".
justice
rehnquist
well,
now,
mr.
tripp,
in
maryland
against
federal
crop
insurance
corporation,
there
a
government
agent,
kind
of
comparably
situated
to
the
ones
you
have
been
talking
about,
made
an
affirmative
representation
to
a
farmer
that
his
wheat
crop
was
covered
by
federal
crop
insurance.
it
turned
out
that
representation
was
contrary
to
the
regulations.
this
court
said
when
you
deal
with
the
government
you
turn
square
corners.
here,
you
are
relying
on
something
that
is
a
failure
to
act
which
is
usually
in
court
law
thought
of
as
much
weaker
than
an
affirmative
misrepresentation.
why
is
your
case
any
better
than
the
federal
crop
insurance
case?
justice
rehnquist
no,
but
he
affirmatively
supplied
misinformation.
justice
rehnquist
but,
that
wasn't
the
reasoning
of
this
court.
they
didn't
say
there
was
no
damage
from
the
misrepresentation.
they
said
you
can
hold
the
government
for
a
misrepresentation
in
a
way
you
can
hold
a
private
individual.
justice
rehnquist
again,
there
is
no
question
but
the
reliance
was
reasonable
in
the
merrill
case.
it
strikes
me
your
distinctions
are
really
quite
unsubstantial.
justice
rehnquist
would
your
view
be
that
under
present
application
it
would
be
enough
to
have
met
the
hardship
requirements
as
of
1973
or
would
you
have
to
show
hardship
now?
justice
rehnquist
so,
there
isn't
any
hardship
requirement
or
any
requirement
you
can't
get
credit
elsewhere?
