mr.
theodore
l.
tripp,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
justice
stevens,
i
think,
has
hit
upon
the
issue
in
this
case
and
that
is
that
the
agency
asks
this
court
to
rule
that
a
federal
court
is
powerless
to
provide
a
remedy
for
the
gross
failure
of
an
entire
agency
to
provide
notice
required
by
binding
regulation.
we
believe
that
the
administrative
procedure
act
mandates
the
use
of
equitable
remedies,
to
compel
agency
action,
in
this
case
notice,
which
was
not
provided,
and
to
set
aside
agency
action,
in
this
case,
the
application
of
the
administrative
deadline,
until
the
agency
observes
the
procedures
required
by
law.
first
of
all,
this
is
not
a
challenge
to
the
contents
of
a
press
release.
the
district
court
made
findings
which
i
believe
are
crucial
to
understand
the
context
of
the
issue
before
this
court.
this
was
a
natural
event
which
gave
rise
to
losses
and
under
7
usc
1961
provided
that
natural
citizens
who
were
full-time
farmers,
who
were
engaged
in
farming
activities
and
suffered
losses,
were
entitled
to
apply
for
government
benefits.
that
program
had
been
statutorily
proceeding
for
many
years
until
1972.
in
1972,
the
secretary
of
agriculture
decided
for
executive
budgetary
reasons
that
he
would
decrease
the
availability
of
those
programs
that
he
felt
was
least
essential.
that
is
the
backdrop
for
the
enactment
of
public
law
93-24
which
amended
section
1961
and
instead
of
saying
the
secretary
may
make
loans
available
in
these
circumstances,
the
language
was
changed
by
congress
to
provide
that
the
secretary
shall
make
those
loans
available.
we
believe
that
at
the
time
congress
made
that
change
congress
was
aware
that
the
farmers
home
administration
had
binding
regulations,
justice
rehnquist,
that
required
certain
types
of
notice
be
afforded
so
that
the
agency
would
carry
out
this
statutory
mandate
to
make
loan
benefits
available
to
farmers
who
suffer
loss.
mr.
theodore
l.
tripp,
jr.
not
directly
to
the
existence
of
the
regulation.
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
the
congress
intended
to
change
it
from
a
discretionary
function,
may
make
loans
available,
to
a
mandatory
function,
precisely
so
that
the
loan
benefits
would
be
made
available.
we
would
suggest
that
to
allow
an
application
of
an
administrative
deadline
cannot
be
considered,
therefore,
in
the
abstract.
mr.
theodore
l.
tripp,
jr.
justice
white,
in
the
enactment
of
93-237,
which
came
later,
after
93-24,
they
did,
when
confusion
arose
among
the
farmers
as
to
what--
mr.
theodore
l.
tripp,
jr.
--it
is
clear
that
congress
intended
there
to
be
a
deadline.
mr.
theodore
l.
tripp,
jr.
no.
mr.
theodore
l.
tripp,
jr.
the
court
of
appeals
feels
and
we
feel
the
legislative
history
shows
that
that
was
more
in
the
nature
of
action
by
congress
to
insure
that
people
were
not--
mr.
theodore
l.
tripp,
jr.
--no,
sir,
justice
white.
mr.
theodore
l.
tripp,
jr.
well,
the
90-day
deadline
existed
before
93-237.
mr.
theodore
l.
tripp,
jr.
it
has
been
an
on-going
deadline
that
applies
not
just
to
this
disaster
but
to
each
and
every
disaster.
they
have
said
90
days
for
property
damage
and
nine
months
for
production
losses.
it
is
not
a
regulation
that
only
applies
to
us.
but,
in
1973,
when
congress
believed
that
eligible
farmers
were
not
making
application
because
of
confusion
over
the
benefits,
they,
in
93-237,
required
an
extension
for
90
days.
we
believe
that
was
a
minimum
extension
and
did
not
mean
by
congress
you
may
not
extend
it
any
further.
mr.
theodore
l.
tripp,
jr.
in
our
view,
justice
rehnquist,
congress
required
a
minimum
extension
of
the
application
period--
mr.
theodore
l.
tripp,
jr.
--at
that
time,
that
is
correct,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
theodore
l.
tripp,
jr.
no,
sir,
i
do
not
believe
that
congress
has
spoken
again
to
that
subject.
the
notice,
however,
that
was
required
to
be
provided
by
the
farmers
home
administration
was
not
simply
that
they
advise
the
news
media
of
the
provisions
of
93-237.
the
district
court
found
that
there
were
other
specific
types
of
notice
required
to
be
provided
to
state
and
county
usda
defense
board
chairmen,
to
other
agricultural
lenders,
to
the
county
governing
bodies
for
the
purpose
of
insuring
that
during
this
administratively
set
application
period
those
who
were
eligible
would
have
an
opportunity
to
come
in
an
apply.
in
each
and
every
instance,
the
district
court
found,
and
we
do
not
understand
the
solicitor
general
to
dispute,
that
the
farmers
home
administration
breached
a
mandatory,
self-imposed
duty
to
provide
notice
to
eligible
farmers.
it
is
in
that
context
that
the
district
court
considered
the
validity
of
the
90-day
deadline.
we
believe
that
the
district
court
found
that
these
farmers
were
clearly
prejudiced
by
the
failure
of
the
farmers
home
administration
to
provide
this
notice.
the
district
court
found
that
more
farmers
would
have
applied
had
the
farmers
home
administration
provided
the
notice,
and,
in
fact,
the
only
loans
that
were
afforded
were
afforded
as
a
result
of
the
fortuity
that
mr.
payne
received
a
letter
from
senator
gurney
which
outlined
the
program.
he
took
it
to
his
farmers
home
administration
county
supervisor,
who
at
that
time...
this
was
now
some
two
or
three
weeks
before
the
90-day
deadline
that
congress
required.
at
that
time
the
county
farmers
home
administration
supervisors
were
not
even
aware
that
congress
had
enacted
this
extension.
to
suggest,
as
the
solicitor
does,
that
the
publication
of
these
regulations
somehow
gives
notice
to
carbie
ellie,
as
i
suggest,
contradicted
by
the
evidence
in
this
case
which
says
that
the
farmers
went
to
the
farmers
home
administration
county
officials
and
were
affirmatively
told
there
are
no
emergency
loan
benefits
for
which
to
apply.
it
is
rebutted
by
the
district
court's
findings
that
the
efforts
of
the
farmers
home
administration
to
make
such
public
announcements
as
appear
appropriate
consisted
entirely
of
one
press
release
which
stated
that
the
deadline
was
some
70
days
hence,
when,
in
fact,
there
was
a
nine-month
application
period
for
crop
loss.
and,
participation
in
the
live
oak
meeting
at
which
farmers
who
went
for
the
express
purpose
of
inquiring
about
the
availability
of
emergency
loans
were
told
if
you
are
a
farmer
there
is
nothing
for
you
to
apply
for
because
there
are
no
benefits
available
to
farmers.
in
fact,
the
farmers
home
administration
had
actual
knowledge
of
existing
fmha
borrowers
who
suffered
losses
as
a
result
of
this
disaster
and
who
needed
these
emergency
loans.
they
visited
those
farms
and
they
did
not
inform
the
farmers
of
the
availability
of
the
fmha
loan
benefits.
we
believe
under
these
circumstances,
the
administrative
procedure
act
has
empowered
the
federal
court
to
remedy
this
failure
to
act.
mr.
theodore
l.
tripp,
jr.
for
at
least
two
reasons,
justice
rehnquist.
first
of
all,
the
agent
to
whom
mr.
merrill
applied
was
not
required
by
regulation
to
provide
information
concerning
this
loan
program
to
this
particular
farmer.
mr.
theodore
l.
tripp,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
as
i
recall
the
facts
of
that
case,
there
was
no
alternative
available
to
that
farmer.
he
could
not
go
out
and
get
spring
wheat
crop
insurance
from
some
other
source.
so,
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
he
was
prejudiced.
mr.
theodore
l.
tripp,
jr.
that
is
correct,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
that
has
been
extended
by
this
court
to
suggest
that
you
may
not
remedy
the
failure
of
an
agency
to
comply
with
its
own
regulations.
in
this
case,
we
are
complaining
not
about
the
misstatement
in
the
abstract
in
isolation,
but
by
a
failure
to
provide
notice
required
by
regulations,
coupled
with
affirmative
misrepresentations
which
were
reasonably
relied
upon
by
these
farmers
in
failing
to
apply
for
benefits
which
they
were
told
were
not--
mr.
theodore
l.
tripp,
jr.
--the
third
distinction
that
i
would
suggest,
justice
rehnquist,
between
the
merrill
case
and
this
case
is
that
the
merrill
case
did
not
present
a
situation
where
an
agency
has,
through
misrepresentation
or
inaction,
frustrated
a
congressional
intent.
i
believe
that
the
clear...
the
circuit
court
and
the
district
court
all
found
that
the
clear
intent
behind
the
statutory
scheme
which
established
the
right
of
emergency
loan
benefits
and
these
farmers
was
frustrated
and,
in
fact,
was
completely
nullified
by
the
agency's
refusal
to
provide
this
notice.
so,
while
the
merrill
court
was
presented
with
a
situation
where,
if
the
relief
had
been
granted,
then
government
monies
would
be
expended
for
a
purpose
contrary
to
statute
or
regulations.
here,
you
have
a
situation
where
applicants
are
eligible
for
benefits,
where
the
benefits
are
going
to
be
spent
for
purposes
intended
by
congress
and
where
the
only
thing
that
is
thwarting
the
intent
of
congress
in
this
case
is
the
agency's
failure
to
provide
the
notice
required
by
the
regulations.
mr.
theodore
l.
tripp,
jr.
justice
o'connor,
there
are
four
aspects
to
the
publicity
regulations.
first,
the
notice
to
the
state
and
county
usds
defense
board
individuals
and
we
had
direct
testimony
from
a
member
of
the
board
who
testified
that
the
farmers
home
administration
did
not
apprise
him
of
the
existence
of
this
emergency
loan
program.
with
regard
to
the
duty
to
inform
other
agricultural
lenders,
we
had
the
testimony
of
the
chairman
of
the
board
of
the
federal
land
bank,
mr.
welch,
who
testified
that
he
was
a
farmer,
he
needed
emergency
loans,
and
he
was
not
aware
of
it.
and,
nobody
ever
told
the
primary
commercial
agricultural
lender
in
this
area.
with
regard
to
the
requirement
that
they
notify
the
county
governing
bodies,
i
believe
that
the
record
shows
a
stipulation
that
that
notice
was
not
afforded.
so,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
there
is
certainly
confident
and
substantial
evidence
and
it
is
not
clearly
erroneous
to
suppose
that
both
the
initial
application
period
and
the
extended
application
period
required
by
congress,
those
four
specific
types
of
notice
were
not,
in
fact,
afforded.
and,
the
testimony
showed
from
the
farmers
that
when
they
attempted
to
determine
what
benefits
might
be
available,
they
went
first
to
the
fmha
and
were
told
that
nothing
was
there
for
which
to
apply
and
then
consulted
with
other
agricultural
lenders,
usda
officials,
and
county
governing
bodies.
so,
the
failure
to
provide
all
of
those
notices,
we
believe,
is
supported
in
the
record
and
shows
that
as
a
result
these
eligible
benificiaries
were
deprived
not
only
of
the
notice
but
of
the
opportunity
to
apply
for
these
benefits.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
an
order
which
requires
the
expenditure
of
funds.
the
district
court
awarded
only
the
ability
to
apply.
consistent
with
this
court's
holdings
that
it
keenly
observe
the
requirements,
the
valid
requirement
for
charging
the
public
fist,
the
farmers
home
administration
is
directed
to
apply
the
eligibility
requirements
and
the
restrictions
on
the
utilization
of
those
funds
when
and
if
any
eligible
farmers
can
demonstrate
their
ability,
their
entitlement
to
receive
the
funds.
so,
we
are
not
overriding
in
this
case
any
statutory
regulation
with
regard
to
the
expenditure
of
these
benefits.
we
are
not,
unlike
heckler
or
the
other
cases
in
which
this
court
has
been
asked
to
require
expenditures
of
funds
which
have
lapsed
or
no
longer
available.
this
is
a
revolving
fund.
the
monies
were
available
in
1973
and
they
continue
to
be
available
today.
finally,
we
believe
that--
mr.
theodore
l.
tripp,
jr.
--well,
as
the
solicitor
general
himself
concedes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
it
is
not
need
which
defines
participation,
it
is
loss.
the
regulations
as
amended
do
not
require
that
you
show
that
you
were
unable
to
acquire
credit
from
other
sources.
the
only
thing
that
you
need
show
is
that
you
suffered
a
demonstrable
loss,
that
it
was
a
significant
loss
under
the
regulations,
and
that
you
are
a
farmer
who
is
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
and
capable
of
repaying
the
loan.
mr.
theodore
l.
tripp,
jr.
not
under
93-237.
there
was
in
the
initial
loan
application
period
and
if
you
could
obtain
credit
elsewhere
you
were
not
entitled
to
participate
in
that
program.
but,
as
amended,
that
program
removed
the
requirement
that
you
show
the
non-availability
of
credit
elsewhere.
so,
we
believe
it
is
the
event
of
loss
to
which
congress
directed
itself
and
not
whether
or
not
you
have
a
current
financial
hardship.
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
the
regulations
of
the
farmers
home
administration,
you
will
see
that
you
are
authorized
under
the
regulations
to
spend
those
monies
for
seed,
for
fertilizer,
for
rent,
for
family
expenses,
for
a
variety
of
things
that
are
not
necessarily
tied
directly
to
the
waters
and
the
damage
caused
by
the
waters.
mr.
theodore
l.
tripp,
jr.
the
interest
rate
initially
under
the
first
application
period
was
five
percent
which
would
have
been
the
same
as
operating
loans.
we
submit...
the
district
court
found
by
the
way
that
the
prejudice
in
the
switching
and
there
was
testimony
that
when
a
farmer
came
to
inquire
about
emergency
loans,
he
was
switched
to
an
operating
loan,
which
also
drew
interest
at
five
percent.
however,
the
more
beneficial
terms
of
93-237,
which
reduced
the
interest
rate
to
one
percent
and
which
provided
for
the
$5,000
forgiveness,
was
that
if
someone
had
applied
for
an
emergency
loan
during
the
original
application
period
and
had
been
turned
down,
they
would
have
received
and
would
have
been
required
to
receive
under
the
farmers
home
administration
regulations
individual
letter
notice,
saying
we
now
have
a
more
beneficial
program
available,
you
may
come
down
and
reapply
and
the
availability
of
other
credit
no
longer
precludes
your
participation
in
this
program.
because
the
farmers
home
administration
in
some
circumstances
switched
farmers
from
emergency
loans
to
operating
loans,
the
district
court
found
that
they
were
deprived
of
the
individual
letter
notice,
because
while
the
letters
were
provided
and
while
the
farmers
home
administration
continued
to
send
routine
mailings
to
its
farmer
clients
during
the
scope
of
this
application
period,
they
never
provided
the
letter
notice
to
anyone
because
no
one
had
applied
for
the
emergency
loans
which
they
were
told
were
not
available.
mr.
theodore
l.
tripp,
jr.
mr.
justice--
mr.
theodore
l.
tripp,
jr.
--the
regulations
which
were
in
effect
in
1973,
at
the
time
of
this
loss,
and
which
continue
in
effect
today,
provide
that
with
regard
to
production
losses
the
applicant's
statement
of
loss
shall
be
accepted
without
further
investigation
if
it
seems--
mr.
theodore
l.
tripp,
jr.
--justice
marshall,
i
believe
that
most
a
lot
of
farmers,
for
example...
mr.
ellie,
who
was
a
named
plaintiff,
has
an
arrangement
whereby
he
borrows
money
from
the
farmers
home
administration,
he
pledges
his
crops.
when
the
crops
are
harvested
they
handle
the
marketing
of
the
crops,
so,
there
would
be
records
in
that
instance
of
the
farmers
home
administration
itself
that
would
show
the
diminution
of
the
crop
return.
with
regard
to
other
farmers,
it
is
true
that
the
agency's
continued
refusal
to
provide
notice
and
continued
resistance
to
judicial
requirements
that
it
provide
that
notice,
as
imposed
by
its
own
regulations,
had
forced
these
farmers
to
wait
for
ten
years.
mr.
theodore
l.
tripp,
jr.
i
believe
the
farmer
who
sold
out
and
left
has
simply
been...
irrevocably
deprived
of
his
right
to
participate
in
this
program,
but
those
who
have
hung
in,
we
assert,
are
the
benificiaries
of
a
congressional
intent
that
those
who
suffer
losses
be
given
an
opportunity
to
apply
following
reasonable
notice.
mr.
theodore
l.
tripp,
jr.
absolutely
not,
justice
white.
i
think
that...
when
you
are
dealing
with
a
statutory
termination
you
get
into
a
different
area.
here
you
have
an
administratively
set
regulation.
it
is
not
set
for
this
particular
disaster.
they
are
seeking
to
apply
this
deadline,
the
courts
below
found,
to
frustrate
the
intent
of
the
congressional
scheme.
obviously,
if
congress
itself
says
that
we
are
going
to
give
$5,000
to
each
and
every
farmer
who
applies
before
july
1,
congress
is
free
to
make
that
distinction.
we
suggest
that
the
difference
is
an
executive
agency
has
never
been
thought
to
be
empowered
to
frustrate
the
intent
of
congress
by
failing
to
provide
notice
that
it
is
required
to
afford
under
the
applicable
regulations
and
then
applying
the
deadline
which
we
submit
is
contingent
upon
and
its
validity
rests
upon
their
compliance
with
the
procedure
required
by
law,
that
is
the
notice.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
thank
you
very
much.
