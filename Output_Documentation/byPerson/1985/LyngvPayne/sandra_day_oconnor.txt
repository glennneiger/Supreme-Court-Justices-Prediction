justice
o'connor
you
know,
counsel,
it
isn't
all
that
clear
to
me
that
the
courts
were
below
were
correct
in
saying
that
the
agency
violated
its
own
publicity
regulations.
the
requirement
the
agency
imposed
on
itself
was
something
to
the
effect
that
it
give
appropriate
notice
and
i
would
think
the
agency's
own
implementation
of
its
own
regulations
is
some
indication
that
the
agency
thought
what
it
did
was
appropriate.
and,
i
have
a
little
trouble
just
conceding
that
the
court
below
was
correct
in
finding
a
violation
of
the
publicity
regulations.
justice
o'connor
what
is
the
interest
rate
available
on
this
particular
category
of
loans?
