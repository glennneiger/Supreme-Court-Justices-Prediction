justice
white
didn't
congress
extend
whatever
deadline
there
was
by
90
days
or
something
like
that?
justice
white
isn't
it
clear
that
congress
intended
there
to
be
a
deadline?
justice
white
so,
it
is
a
statutory
deadline?
justice
white
well,
if
it
is
90
days
from
whatever
it
was,
that
sounds
to
me
like
a
statutory
deadline.
justice
white
well,
suppose
the
agency
had
previously
administratively
set
march
1,
1985
as
a
deadline
and
the
congress
comes
along
and
says
please
extend
that
deadline
for
90
days.
that
is
not
hard
to
understand.
justice
white
it
is
still
an
administrative
deadline?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
i
take
it
you
would
be
making
the
same
argument
if
the
statute
unambigously
said
that
all
applications
will
be
made
before
a
certain
date,
april
30,
1979.
suppose
the
statute
just
said
that.
then
the
regulation
said,
well,
we
really
ought
to
publicize
all
this
stuff
to
the
farmers
and
they
never
did
and
they
just
failed
to
live
up
to
their
own
regulations.
do
you
think
the
court
has
authority
to
set
aside
that--
justice
white
i
take
it
you
are
not
urging
that
this
was
the
statutory
deadline.
