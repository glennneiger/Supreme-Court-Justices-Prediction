mr.
robert
hermann
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
seven
years
ago
congress
codified
the
power
of
a
trustee
in
bankruptcy
to
abandon
worthless,
burdensome
property.
in
so
doing,
the
trustee
here
argues
congress
meant
to
displace
not
only
existing
case
law,
but
other
provisions
of
the
bankruptcy
code
section
of
the
judicial
code,
and
much
significant
environmental
legislation
that
had
been
enacted
to
that
time,
even
though
congress
never
said
so
in
codifying
section
554(a).
furthermore,
as
a
result,
the
trustee
argues
that
he
has
an
absolute
right
to
abandon
property
that
can't
do
the
estate
any
good,
whether
that
property
consists
of
toxic
wastes
or
plutonium
rods
from
a
failing
nuclear
plant.
we
hope
that
that
view
is
wrong,
and
we
submit
that
it
is.
in
the
time
allotted
to
the
states
here
insofar
as
some
division
of
responsibility
will
be
helpful
to
the
court,
i
am
going
to
address
our
overview
of
the
case,
the
abandonment
provision,
and
its
relationship
to
other
statutes
and
case
law,
and
the
preemption
question,
and
my
co-counsel
from
new
jersey
is
going
to
address
the
taking
question,
whether
this
case
is
really
about
priorities
and
money,
and
the
applicability
of
the
kovaks
case
to
the
situation
here.
i
think
it
is
important
at
the
outset
to
underscore
that
the
situation
before
the
court
here
is
a
limited
one.
this
case
is
not
about
the
$2
million
which
new
york
spent
to
clean
up
the
site.
the
case
in
our
view
is
about
the
bankruptcy's
decision
to
allow
abandonment
in
an
emergency
situation.
the
states
were
faced--
mr.
robert
hermann
--we
are
here,
your
honor,
to
reaffirm
what
we
think
is
an
essential
police
power
of
the
state,
the
ability
of
the
states
to
step
in
in
an
emergency
situation
to
get
an
order
maintaining
the
status
quo
and
preventing
a
situation
where
toxic
wastes
are
leaking
into
the
hudson
river
and
the
court
of
equity
is
powerless
to
do
anything
about
it.
mr.
robert
hermann
yes,
we
did,
your
honor.
we
opposed
the
abandonment
on--
mr.
robert
hermann
--well,
the
situation
was
not
simply
that
the
trustee
proposed
to
walk
away
from
dangerous
property.
the
trustee
proposed
to
eliminate
the
safety
precautions
that
were
necessary
at
the
same
time
to
keep
those
facilities
from
becoming
even
more
dangerous.
in
new
york
city,
for
example,
it
amounted
to
dismissing
the
guard
service,
removing
the
fire
suppression
equipment.
in
new
jersey
it
involved
failing
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
pollution
control
equipment,
in
essence
not
simply
abandoning
a
property,
but
making
more
grave
and
serious
a
situation
that
was
already
highly
dangerous
with
some
of
the
most
toxic
carcinogens
known.
mr.
robert
hermann
well,
quantas
in
this
situation,
your
honor,
was
completely
without
assets
to
do
anything
about
the
situation.
mr.
robert
hermann
i
believe
that
the
situation
deteriorated
substantially
over
a
period
of
eight
months
in
new
york,
and
over
more
than
a
year,
i
believe,
in
new
jersey.
there
were
actual
leaks
in
these
cases
which
were
growing
more
grave.
pollution
control
equipment
had
during
the
time
the
trustee
was
in
possession
of
the
property
become
inoperative,
and
what
was
proposed
was
to
remove
even
the
minimum
amount
of
security
that
was
already
there.
so,
the
situation,
as
the
solicitor
general's
office
says
in
its
brief,
the
trustee
has
no
right
to
take
a
grave
situation
worse.
and
that
is
what
happened
during
the--
mr.
robert
hermann
--that's
right,
your
honor.
i
think
it
is
important
to
emphasize
that
new
york
here--
mr.
robert
hermann
--that's
right.
and
i
emphasize--
mr.
robert
hermann
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
hermann
that
is
right,
your
honor,
we
do.
mr.
robert
hermann
well,
your
honor,
we
don't
think
it
is.
we
believe
that
the
relief
we
are
asking
here
for
was
of
an
emergency
short-term
nature.
the
bankruptcy
court
as
a
court
of
equity
should
have
the
ability
to
essentially
enjoin
the
trustee
from
walking
away,
to
look
into
the
factual--
mr.
robert
hermann
--that's
correct,
but
that's
not
the
issue
we--
mr.
robert
hermann
--but
that
is
not
the
issue
before
the
court
now.
there
has
been
no
finding
about
that.
new
jersey
hasn't
cleaned
up
the
site.
that
hasn't
happened
yet
in
new
jersey,
and
new
york
didn't
clean
up
the
site
until
after
the
relevant
proceedings
in
the
bankruptcy
court
and
in
the
district
court.
mr.
robert
hermann
after
the
abandonment
took
place.
so
we
believe
that
issue
isn't
before
the
court.
certainly
new
york--
mr.
robert
hermann
--that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
hermann
well,
the
debtor
here
was
seeking
to
avail
itself
of
some
of
the
protections
of
the
bankruptcy
code
which
would
not
otherwise
have
been
available
in
a
dissolution
proceeding.
what
we
were
arguing
for,
if
i
may
emphasize
this,
is
simply
the
ability
of
the
bankruptcy
court
to
deal
with
the
emergency
situation.
as
i
say,
new
york
would
like
to
be
able
to
recover
cleanup
costs.
new
york
is
obviously
not
able
to
step
in
and
clean
up
every
toxic
waste
site
as
soon
as
someone
is
prepared
to
abandonment.
but
the
most
fundamental
state
interest
that
we
are
trying
to
assert
here
is
the
ability
of
the
state
to
go
in
on
an
emergency
basis
and
prevent
the
situation
from
getting
worse.
we
are
not
saying
necessarily
that
an
owner...
that
the
trustee
operating
a
toxic
waste
facility
must
ensure
a
cleanup
before
that
property
can
be
abandoned.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
a
court...
as
a
court
of
equity,
the
bankruptcy
court
should
take
into
consider
the
public
health
and
safety
and
environmental
consequences,
and
stabilize
the
situation
so
that
the
abandonment
power
does
not
become
subject
to
abuse.
mr.
robert
hermann
i
think
that's
right,
your
honor,
but
we
are
asking
essentially
for
status
quo
relief.
in
essence
we
were
saying,
don't
take
away
these
precautionary
devices
that
are
needed
to
protect
the
public
until
this
situation
can
be
taken
in
hand
by
the
state
or
by
the
bankruptcy
court
until
a
hearing
can
be
held
on
the
question
of
what
assets
there
really
are
in
the
estate.
i
can't
emphasize
too
strongly
that
there
has
been
no
healing
to
determine
what
assets
really
are
in
the
estate.
mr.
robert
hermann
well,
i
think
the
abandonment
provision
itself
provides
for
notice
in
a
hearing,
and
the
hearing,
we
believe,
should
consider
those
public
health
and
safety
consequences.
mr.
robert
hermann
in
the
same
way
that
any
other
emergency
situation
is
dealt
with
by
a
court
of
equity.
mr.
robert
hermann
well,
we
are
accepting
it
at
face
value
for
purposes
of
the
hypothetical
here,
that
there
were
no
assets
in
the
estate
to
stabilize
the
situation
in
the
short
term.
there
has
been
no
finding
to
that
effect
in
this
record.
that
is
an
assertion
of
the
trustee
that
was
never
tested
at
a
hearing
in
this
case.
we
think
the
state
should
be
entitled
to
a
hearing,
to
say,
show
us
that
there
are
no
assets
available
to
keep
running...
the
trustee
here
was
asking
in
essence
to
stop
doing
what
he
had
been
doing
for
over
eight
months
already,
which
is
to
treat
as
administration
expenses
the
cost
of
maintaining
this
property.
mr.
robert
hermann
that's
true,
your
honor.
i
think
the
equities
do
enter
into
the
consideration
that
is
before
the
bankruptcy
court.
certainly
in
a
situation
where
the
trustee
has
assets
that
are
miniscule
compared,
for
example,
to
the
costs
of
a
cleanup,
or
where
in
essence
the
situation
is
one
of
bleeding
the
estate
dry
bit
by
bit.
the
court
should
consider
that.
as
i
say,
we
are
not
saying
that
the
state
is
entitled
to
a
total
cleanup
before
the
trustee
can
abandon
the
property
or
the
bankruptcy
court
can
take
any
other
action,
but
we
are
saying
these
are
factors
which
the
court
should
consider
and
which
courts
traditionally
do
consider
in
such
situations.
mr.
robert
hermann
i
don't
think
in
this
situation
that
we
were
in
pari
delicto,
because
one
of
the
things
that
was
clear
here
is
that
on
the
record,
this
particular
debtor
was
notorious,
was
subject
to
consent
orders
in
both
new
york
and
new
jersey
for
violations.
one
of
the
things
that
the
lenders
here
certainly
failed
to
do
and
hasn't
been
pointed
out
is
to
note
that
there
were
on
record
both
in
new
york
and
new
jersey
cleanup
orders
which
required
quanta
in
both
cases
to
clean
up
these
sites.
it
was
only
very
shortly
before
these
proceedings
took
place
that
these
orders
were
in
effect.
it
would
seem
to
me
the
most
basic
precaution
on
the
part
of
a
lender
would
be
to
say
what
are
your
outstanding
obligations
to
the
various
states?
this
wasn't
a
hypothetical
situation.
this
was
a
very
real...
a
very
real
situation
where
there
were
people
who
had
agreed
in
both
states
to
clean
up
these
very
sites
in
question.
one
of
the
interests
that
the
state
here
is
seeking
is
to
prevent
the
creation
of
what
we
regard
as
a
very
large
loophole
in
the
environmental
laws.
certainly
we
believe
that
toxic
waste
dumpers
should
not
be
able
to
manipulate
the
bankruptcy
laws
to
avoid
compliance
with
them,
but
i
would
also
point
out
that
while
this
case
has
been
cast
in
preemption
terms,
the
result
is
really
far
broader,
because
the
trustee
is
saying
that
there
is
an
impossibility
of
dual
compliance
with
both
the
bankruptcy
abandonment
power
and
the
federal
environmental--
mr.
robert
hermann
--that's
right.
mr.
robert
hermann
no,
i
am
merely
pointing
out,
your
honor,
the
breadth
of
the
argument,
that
it
goes
not
simply
to
ignoring
state
environmental
concerns,
but
also
to
ignoring
federal
environmental
concerns
as
well,
and
essentially
granting
them
an
unfettered
right
to
abandon
property
which
he
regards
as
worthless.
mr.
robert
hermann
that's
right,
your
honor.
it
doesn't
expressly
contain
any
conditions
in
it,
but
we
believe
that
it
incorporates
prior
case
law,
which
we
believe
is
more
well
developed
than
the
trustee
acknowledges.
much
has
been
made
of
the
proposition
that
the
bankruptcy
court
doesn't...
that
the
abandonment
provision
doesn't
expressly
incorporate
an
exception
into
it,
and
we
think
that
that
proposition,
essentially
that
congress
knew
how
to
write
the
exception
when
it
wished
to
do
so,
doesn't
really
help
decide
this
case,
because
there
are
numerous
other
statutes
in
this
case
that
are
called
into
play
which
are
equally
unqualified,
and
which
intersect
with
the
policies
of
section
554(a).
mr.
robert
hermann
what
we
are
suggesting,
your
honor,
is
that
in
the
short
term
the
trustee
should
be
required
to
do
what
he
had
been
doing
for
eight
months.
mr.
robert
hermann
until
the
court
can
hold
a
hearing
and
determine
how
serious
the
problems
are,
how
much
it
would
cost
to
clean
those
problems
up,
what
assets
are
really
available
in
the
estate,
what
prospects
there
are
for--
mr.
robert
hermann
--that's
right,
your
honor,
but
there
are
also
other
statutes
which
come
into
play
here.
there
is
section
959(b),
about
which
very
little
has
been
said,
which
requires
the
trustee
to
obey
the
valid
laws
of
the
state.
there
is
section
362(b)(4),
which
allows
the
government
enforcement
proceedings,
which
are
already
in
place,
to
continue
to
fight
the
filing
of
a
petition
in
bankruptcy.
all
of
these
policies
also
come...
essentially
a
situation
of
focusing
on
one
statute.
the
court
has
before
it
several
statutes
which
intersect
in
the
circumstances
that
are
presented
here.
mr.
robert
hermann
no,
i
don't
think
our
position
goes
quite
that
far,
your
honor.
i
think
there
is
authority
for
it.
mr.
robert
hermann
i
think
there
is
authority,
your
honor,
if
that
would
be...
the
situation
were
such
that
it
could
be
stabilized,
and
there
could
be
an
orderly
winding
up
of
the
estate,
and
responsible
parties
were
on
the
scene,
to
handle
the
situation
and
prevent
it
from
getting
out
of
hand.
i
don't
think
it
is
new
york's
position
that
all
assets
of
the
estate
must
be
exhausted
for
abandonment
of
a
particular
property
would
be....
mr.
robert
hermann
in
many
situations,
reality
forces
us
to
recognize
that
the
private
parties
are
simply
not
in
a
position
to
do
it.
in
this
case,
new
york
spent
over
$2
million
already,
and
the
cleanup
is
only
partial,
and
much
remains
to
be
done.
but
we
believe
there
is
authority
for
it,
and
that
authority
relies
on
the
administration
expenses
sections
of
the
code,
503
and
506.
furthermore,
i
would
point
out
that
the
bankruptcy
courts
have
continued
since
the
enactment
of
the
code
in
1978
to
apply
this
kind
of
public
endangerment
qualification,
and
congress
again
has
had
an
opportunity
to
reverse
that,
and
has
not
done
so.
mr.
robert
hermann
no,
new
york
does
not
have
a
first
lien
statute,
as
new
jersey
does.
new
york
is
in
the
process
of
considering
that.
as
of
now,
new
york
does
not
have
a
first
lien
statute.
mr.
robert
hermann
yes,
we
do.
we
disagree
with
that.
mr.
robert
hermann
it
doesn't.
mr.
robert
hermann
i
don't
believe
it
does.
mr.
robert
hermann
i
don't
believe
it
does.
mr.
robert
hermann
no,
i
don't
believe
it
does.
