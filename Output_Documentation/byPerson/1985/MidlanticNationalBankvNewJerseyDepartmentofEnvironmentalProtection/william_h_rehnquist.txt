mr.
mcenroe,
what
are
the
legal
consequences
of
the
bankruptcy
law
of
abandonment,
insofar
as
the
title
to
the
property
goes?
if
the
bankruptcy
judge
approves
abandonment,
does
that
mean
that
title...
where
does
title
then
go?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
there
liens
on
the
property?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
legal
effect
of
abandonment
is
to
have
the
title
of
the
property
revert
back
to
the
debtor.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
does
that
disadvantage
midlantic
as
a
secured
credit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
your
lien
isn't
on
any
particular
property?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
did
the
third
circuit
say
your
lien
was
subordinated
then
to
the
cleanup
costs?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
are
you
any
worse
off
than
before
quantas'
bankruptcy?
the
title
has
gone
back
to
quantas.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
presume
that
was
the
case
on
the
day
it
filed
for
bankruptcy.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
claim
a
right
to
those
security
assets,
too,
i
take
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
certainly
if
the
state
of
new
york
were
concerned
with
emergency
environmental
situation,
and
wherever
this
place
was
in
new
york,
it
wouldn't
be
logical
to
go
to
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
and
say
we
need
emergency
action
in
the
next
12
hours,
you
take
it.
i
mean,
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
is
the
last
place
you
would
go
for
that
sort
of
action.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
a
moment
ago,
general
hermann,
that
you
were
suggesting
this
was
kind
of
an
interim
type
of
thing,
that
the
trustee
was...
you
are
attacking
him
here
for
having
made
matters
worse
since
he
took
over.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
would
sense
from
what
you
just
said
that
you
would
fault
the
trustee
for
things
that
quantas
had
done
in
the
past.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
is
what
the
bankruptcy
court
may
well
do.
it
certainly
has
no
conditions
on
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
ms.
jacobson,
assuming
that
what
you
say
may
well
be
correct
as
to
the
priorities,
why
should
all
this
marshalling
of
assets
discussion
turn
on
whether
or
not
the
property
is
allowed
to
be
abandoned?
i
mean,
isn't
it
more,
as
justice
o'connor
suggests,
just
a
question
of
priorities
of
claims
that
really
doesn't
turn
on
whether
or
not
abandonment
is
granted
at
all?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
saying
that
he
cannot
through
the
process
of
abandonment
relieve
himself
of
those
custodial
responsibilities?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
means
your
answer
is
yes.
