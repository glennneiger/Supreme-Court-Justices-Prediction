justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
pursue
that?
i
am
a
little
puzzled.
say
you
have
three
oil
tanks
and
one
of
them
is
contaminated,
and
it
costs
a
lot
of
money
to
clean
it
up,
and
the
authorities
say
clean
it
up.
the
other
two
could
be
sold.
could
he...
is
he
required
regardless
of
the
economics
of
it
to
abandon
the
one?
he
can't
use
the
assets
by
selling
the
other
two
to
clean
up
that
one?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
at
that
point,
did
your
lien
also
include,
also
attach
to
the
property
that
the
trustee
sought
to
abandon?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
basically
what
you
are
saying
is,
you
could
foreclose
your
lien
by
taking
the
valuable
property
and
ignoring
the...
you
could
make
a
selective
foreclosure.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
terrell,
could
i
ask
you
about
your
signal
to
the
financial
community.
couldn't
one
argue
the
contrary,
that
the
signal
ought
to
be
that
you
should
not
be
lending
money
to
these
companies
unless
you
are
satisfied
they
will
be
able
to
comply
with
the
environmental
laws?
that
that
is
just
another
precaution
that
the
business
community
ought
to
take
before
financing
a
venture
like
this
takes
place?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
hermann,
i
am
puzzled
by
your
response
to
justice
powell,
and
i
really
can't
think
it
through,
perhaps,
but
are
you
contending,
though,
that
the
state's
interest
in
recovering
the
cleanup
costs...
forget
for
a
moment
the
costs
of
maintaining
the
guards,
the
temporary
problem,
but
the
large
amount
spent
cleaning
it
up,
are
you
contending
that
that
comes
ahead
of
the
first
lien
in
all--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--do
you
disagree
with
the
suggestion
by
one
of
your
adversaries
that
the
lienholder
could
make
a
selective
foreclosure
and
just
foreclose
on
the
good
assets,
and
just
ignore
the
liability
aspect?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
not
clear,
then,
on
why
you
don't
think
they
are
able
to
foreclose.
how
does
the
abandonment
of
the
tainted
oil
affect
their
right
to
foreclose
their
land
on
the
assets
that
have
a
value--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--under
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
i
have
asked
too
much
for
the
time...
when
you
don't
have
any
time.
i
really
don't
understand
your
position.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
with
a
question?
it
seems
to
me
that
at
least
arguably
there
are
two
different
issues
on
the
cost.
one
is
the
cleanup
cost
independently
of
avoiding
the
risk
of
further
deterioration
of
the
property.
you
don't
need
guards.
somebody
has
got
to
clean
up
what
has
been
done
in
the
past.
and
secondly,
the
problem
presented
by
guarding
the
property
to
be
sure
it
doesn't
get
worse.
do
you
think
the
costs
of
both
of
those
items
present
the
same
legal
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that.
does
he
also
have
the
obligation
to
decide
who
is
going
to
pay
the
cleanup
costs,
the
full,
total
bill,
the
$<two
point
five>
[=
2.5]
million,
before
he
allows
abandonment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then,
are
you
agreeing
that
they
do
present
separate
issues?
the
analysis
regarding
the
guards
and
the
cost
of
keeping,
maintaining
the
property
does
not
necessarily
apply
to
recovering
the
$2.5
million,
the
total
cleanup?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
view
then,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
cleanup
costs
should
take
priority
over
all
other
claims
of
creditors.
