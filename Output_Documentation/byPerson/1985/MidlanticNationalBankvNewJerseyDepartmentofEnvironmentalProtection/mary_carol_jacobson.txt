ms.
mary
carol
jacobson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
what
the
third
circuit
held,
and
what
we
seek
to
have
affirmed
here,
is
that
abandonment
cannot
go
forward
without
regard
for
public
health
and
safety
concerns.
the
bank
in
this
case
has
argued
that
this
holding
amounts
to
a
taking
of
creditors'
property.
there
is
nothing
in
the
decision
of
the
third
circuit,
however,
which
directly
interferes
with
the
rights
of
creditors.
indeed,
it
remanded
the
priority
issue
for
a
complete
factual
proceeding
in
the
bankruptcy
court.
ms.
mary
carol
jacobson
it
is
an
issue...
the
effect
on
the
creditors
is
something
that
we
don't
know
at
this
point,
because
the
bankruptcy
court
has
not
looked
at
that
issue
on
remand.
certainly
on
remand
the
state
of
new
jersey
is
going
to
make
whatever
arguments
are
available
to
say
that
the
existing
assets
should
be
used
for
cleanup
purposes,
but
how
the
bankruptcy
court--
ms.
mary
carol
jacobson
--we
would
make
that
argument
before
the
bankruptcy
court.
ms.
mary
carol
jacobson
yes.
ms.
mary
carol
jacobson
new
york
in
their
brief
raised
the
possibility
that
under
section
506(c)
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
it
is
possible
under
some
circumstances
that
the
state
through
the
state
could
reach
the
assets
of
secured
creditors.
ms.
mary
carol
jacobson
that
is
one
of
the
views
that
we
would
press
before
the
bankruptcy
court.
the
other
is
simply
an
equitable
argument
that
goes
to
the
issue
that
justice
stevens
raised,
and
that
is
whether
or
not
it
is
equitable
for
the
bank
to
be
able
to
foreclose
only
on
the
claim
property
while
the
contaminated
property
essentially
becomes
a
ward
of
the
state.
ms.
mary
carol
jacobson
well,
it
certainly
goes
beyond
the
abandonment
issue.
the
problem
is
raised
in
this
case
in
the
abandonment
context,
and
we
are
seeking
not
only
to
have
whatever
assets
of
the
estate
available
for
cleanup,
but
as
mr.
hermann
pointed
out,
we
are
seeking
to
have...
to
establish
a
principle
that
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
who
has
custodial
care
of
the
estate
cannot
allow
the
estate
to
become
a
further
hazard
or
further
endanger
the
public
throughout
his
custodial...
during
his
custodial
responsibilities.
ms.
mary
carol
jacobson
we
are
saying
that
the
bankruptcy
court
should
not
allow
abandonment
until
the
public
health
and
safety
concerns
are
addressed.
ms.
mary
carol
jacobson
and
this
may
be
different
given
any...
given
the
particular
circumstances
of
the
case.
for
example,
if
the
landlords
here
were
in
a
position
to
step
in
on
the
new
jersey
site
and
take
care
of
all
the
cleanup,
that
would
be
something
that
should
have
been
put
before
the
bankruptcy
court,
and
if
the
abandonment
had
been
conditioned
upon
landlords
taking
over
and
cleaning
up
the
site,
well,
that
is
something
that
would
have
been
acceptable
to
the
state
of
new
jersey.
what
we
were
seeking
to
enforce
in
the
abandonment
context
was
that
all
the
assets
of
the
estate,
everything
that
was
available
to
the
trustee
should
have
been
used
for
cleanup
purposes.
ms.
mary
carol
jacobson
it
seems
to
be
part
of
the
same
continuum.
on
an
immediate
basis,
in
the
short
term,
before
a
decision
can
be
made
on
abandonment,
it
is
our
position
that
the
trustee
does
have
the
obligation
to
secure
and
stabilize
the
property.
ms.
mary
carol
jacobson
that
is
an
issue
that
we
want
to
raise
with
the
bankruptcy
court.
the
trustee
certainly
is
limited--
ms.
mary
carol
jacobson
--well,
we
see
it
as
the
threshold
part
of
the
same
issue.
if
you
had
a
different
hypothetical,
for
example,
where
all
the
cleanup
could
be
done
easily
within
the
assets
available
to
the
estate,
then
it
might
be
one
and
the
same
question.
at
this
point
we
have
to
face
the
reality
of
the
situation,
which
is
that
there
were
limited
assets
in
this
estate,
and
that
the
cleanup
was
going
to
cost
far
beyond
the
available
assets.
ms.
mary
carol
jacobson
that
is
the
view
that
we
want
to
press
before
the
bankruptcy
court.
yes.
ms.
mary
carol
jacobson
that
is
correct.
ms.
mary
carol
jacobson
that's
correct,
and
that's
essentially
what
the
third
circuit
held.
ms.
mary
carol
jacobson
that
where
you
have
an
imminent
public
health
and
safety
threat,
you
can't
abandon
property
without
regard
to
that
threat.
ms.
mary
carol
jacobson
that
is
an
implication
of
the
decision
which--
ms.
mary
carol
jacobson
--which
absent
factual
findings
it
is
hard
to
play
out
in
this
case.
the
taking
issue
itself
is
an
issue
in
the
area
of
law
which
requires
expensive
factual
findings.
it
is
our
position
that
they
simply
aren't
present
in
this
case,
and
that
the
issue
therefore
is
not
before
the
court.
as
the
representative
of
the
estate,
the
trustee
certainly
had
an
obligation
to
the
public
to
prevent
that
estate
from
becoming
a
public
danger.
in
this
situation,
we
did
have
a
case
where
the
property
was
getting
increasingly
worse
throughout
the
trusteeship.
in
the
kovaks
decision
decided
last
term
by
this
court,
it
was
explicitly
stated
that
the
trustee
must
comply
with
state
law.
the
court
was
also
careful
to
point
out
that
the
kovaks
decision
did
not
give
bankrupts,
debtors
a
license
to
pollute,
nor,
do
we
submit,
does
the
kovaks
decision
give
the
trustee
a
license
to
exacerbate
an
already
dangerous
situation.
in
the
kovaks
case,
the
debtor
there
had
been
completely
dispossessed
by
the
property,
dispossessed
from
the
property,
and
all
that
remained
for
him
to
do
was
to
pay
a
money
judgment.
in
this
case,
the
trustee
had
complete
management
control
of
the
premises,
a
situation
very
different
from
kovaks,
and
it
is
our
position
that
the
trustee
had
an
obligation
to
use
that
management
control
to
protect
the
public.
he
had
to
consider
the
public
interest
as
well
as
the
interest
of
creditors.
the
kovaks
case,
of
course,
did
not
squarely
have
the
abandonment
issue
before
it.
it
did
not
have
a
situation
of
imminent
public
health
and
safety
such
as
is
involved
in
this
case.
when
the
court
looks
at
the
factual
situation
here
and
the
danger
involved
to
the
public,
we
submit
that
it
should
affirm
the
ruling
of
the
third
circuit.
one
thing
that
was
raised
earlier
was,
why
couldn't
the
landlords
or
some
other
party,
including
the
state,
step
in
to
take
the
remedial
action
that
was
necessary.
in
this
case,
the
state
sought
to
have
whatever
responsible
parties
it
could
find
take
remedial
action
on
the
site.
we
did
seek
enforcement
activities
against
the
landlords,
but
as
the
documents
filed
with
the
court
by
the
solicitor
general
demonstrate,
those
efforts
came
to
naught.
again,
the
bankruptcy
court
did
not
look
at
the
environmental
health
and
safety
concerns
at
all.
in
regard
to
the
state
participation
in
this
matter,
the
funds
were
simply
not
available
in
new
jersey
in
1981
to
step
in
and
take
the
remedial
action
that
was
necessary
on
this
property.
ms.
mary
carol
jacobson
well,
in
this
case
the
creditors
certainly
did
take
the
risk.
at
the
time
the
bank--
ms.
mary
carol
jacobson
--certainly
the
secured
creditor
in
this
case,
midlantic
national
bank.
at
the
time
they
made
the
loan,
it
was
june
of
1981.
at
that
time
all
of
the
state
and
federal
environmental
statutes
had
been
in
place
for
many
years.
and--
ms.
mary
carol
jacobson
--i
don't
know.
ms.
mary
carol
jacobson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
reach
of
the
police
power
is
very
great,
as
this
court
has
recognized,
sometimes
so
great
that
even
the
destruction
of
property
interests
are
allowed.
in
the
miller
versus
shoen
case,
for
example,
the
owners
of
those
cedar
trees
that
were
endangering
the
apple
orchard
next
door
had
to
have
all
those
cedar
trees
destroyed
to
protect
the
apple
orchard.
society
makes
different
choices,
and
the
legislature
of
new
jersey
and
the
congress
have
decided
that
the
environment--
ms.
mary
carol
jacobson
--but
the
bankruptcy
code
is
known
for
its
equity
and
its
flexibility,
and
when
it
is
faced
with
a
situation--
ms.
mary
carol
jacobson
--because
of
the
equitable
powers
of
the
bankruptcy
court.
that's
correct.
the
equitable
powers
of
the
bankruptcy
court
in
the
past
were
used
to
address
public
endangerment
problems.
under
the
common
law
in
the
cases
that
we
sited,
the
ottenheimer
case
and
the
lewis
jones
case,
the
bankruptcy
laws
were
made
flexible
enough
to
take
into
account
public
danger,
even
at
the
expense
of
creditors.
what
the
states
are
seeking
here
is
to
enforce
the
most
classic
of
their
police
powers,
and
that
is
the
protection
of
the
public
through
the
prevention
and
control
of
serious
public
nuisances.
ms.
mary
carol
jacobson
as
to
the
bank?
ms.
mary
carol
jacobson
right.
well,
in
this
situation--
ms.
mary
carol
jacobson
--in
this
situation
the--
ms.
mary
carol
jacobson
--both
the
bank
and
the
state
have
to
monitor
the
situation,
the
bank
because
it
is
interested
in
protecting
its
property
and
should
be
interested
in
what
the
person
it
loaned
the
money--
ms.
mary
carol
jacobson
--the
bank
does
not
have
the
police
powers
of
the
state,
and
it
is
a
balancing
test,
as
the
third
circuit
held,
and
you
have
to
look
at
the
rights
of
secured
creditors
and
what
they
knew
or
should
have
known
at
the
time
they
made
this
loan
to
quanta.
in
addition
to
the
regulatory
background
that
was
in
place
when
the
loan
was
made,
there
was
also
outstanding
administrative
consent
orders
against
quanta
ordering
cleanup.
the
bank
knew
or
should
have
known
about
these
things,
and
this
should
have
been
factored
into
their
decision.
they
made
a
business
risk,
and
it
is
the
position
of
the
states
that
that
risk
should
not
be
transferred
to
the
public.
thank
you.
