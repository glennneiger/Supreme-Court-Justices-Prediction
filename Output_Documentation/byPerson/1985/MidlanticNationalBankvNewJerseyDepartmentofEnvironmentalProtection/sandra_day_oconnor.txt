mr.
mcenroe,
do
you
concede
that
there
may
be
some
limitation
on
the
power
of
abandonment
to
meet
public
safety
concerns?
for
example,
the
solicitor
general
in
a
brief
has
suggested
that
the
act
of
abandonment
cannot
create
a
public
nuisance.
do
you
concede
there
is
any
limitation
at
all?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
no
obligation
even
in
the
interim
for
the
trustee
to
take
emergency
measures
to
prevent
something
in
the
estate
from
constituting
a
public
nuisance,
for
example?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
suppose
if
the
state
has
a
law
that
gives
the
state
a
first
lien
on
property
which
it
has
to
clean
up
and
restore
and
expend
its
funds
to
do
so,
that
that
state's
first
lien
can
take
priority
over
the
secured
creditor?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
as
a
matter
of
state
law
it
is
possible
that
the
state
can
give
itself
a
first
lien
that
would
come
in
ahead
of
any
security
interest
on
the
property.
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
concede
it
is
possible.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
would
have
happened
if
no
bankruptcy
had
been
filed
at
all,
and
the
corporation
had
dissolved?
could
new
york
have
come
in
and
done
its
cleanup
and
had
a
first
lien
under
state
law
that
would
come
in
ahead
of
secured
creditors?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let's
talk
about
the
theoretical--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--possibilities,
if
you
would
for
a
minute.
what
would
happen...
if
you
remember
the
question--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--go
ahead
and
answer
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it
possible,
of
course,
that
a
state
could
give
itself
first
priority?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
isn't
this
really
a
question
of
priority
of
claims?
it
seems
to
me
the
abandonment
question
in
this
context
is
pretty
much
of
a
red
herring.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
in
the
present
posture
of
the
case,
money
has
been
expended
by
new
jersey
and
by
the
city
of
new
york.
they
want
to
be
repaid
to
the
extent
there
are
assets
in
the
estate.
isn't
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
it
really
is
a
priority
claim.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
if
the
corporation
had
just
chosen
to
dissolve
and
walk
away
from
all
these
assets?
then
the
state
would
have
to
come
in
and
take
whatever
measures
it
wanted
to
take,
and
by
its
own
law
try
to
get
priority
to
be
recouped,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
why
should
the
filing
of
a
bankruptcy
change
that
outcome?
