may
i
ask
this?
is
it
your
position
in
a
situation
like

perhaps
not
your
particular
case,
would
new

insist
that
the
assets
of
the
estate
could
be
totally
exhausted
or
had
to
be
totally
exhausted
if
it
were
necessary
to
clean
up
the
environmental
problem?

lewis
f.

do
you
think
there
would
come
a
point
when
something
would
be
left
for
creditors?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
have
to
find
somebody
other
than
the
state
to
clean
up
the
sites.
