mr.
william
f.
mc
enroe
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
presents
to
the
court
the
question
of
the
scope
of
the
abandoned
tower
rented
to
a
trustee
in
bankruptcy
under
section
554(a)
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
that
section
provides
that
after
notice
and
a
hearing,
a
trustee
may
abandon
a
property
of
the
estate
that
is
burdensome
to
the
estate
or
of
inconsequential
value
to
the
estate.
the
specific
issue
here
is
whether
the
trustee
may
abandon
property
where
it
is
uncontroverted
that
that
property
is
both
burdensome
and
of
inconsequential
value,
but
where
abandonment
is
opposed
by
governmental
agencies
on
environmental
grounds.
the
debtor
in
this
case,
quanta
resources
corporation,
was
engaged
in
the
business
of
recycling
waste
oils.
they
operated
sites
in
new
york
and
new
jersey.
in
1981,
it
was
determined
that
there
existed
on
both
sites
substantial
quantities
of
oil
that
were
contaminated
with
pcb's.
in
july
of
1981,
quanta
ceased
its
operations.
at
the
time
it
ceased
its
operations,
there
were
already
in
effect
orders
from
the
states
of
new
york
and
new
jersey
requiring
quanta
to
clean
up
the
sites
and
to
take
other
remedial
actions.
in
october,
1981,
quanta
filed
a
voluntary
petition
for
reorganization
under
chapter
11
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
those
proceedings
were
converted
to
a
chapter
7
liquidation
in
november,
and
thomas
j.
o'neill
was
appointed
trustee.
upon
his
appointment
as
trustee,
mr.
o'neill
undertook
an
analysis
of
the
property
of
the
estate
similar
to
the
procedure
outlined
by
this
court
in
its
decision
in
ohio
versus
kovaks.
he
obtained
appraisals
of
the
property,
searches
as
to
judgments
and
liens,
and
also
estimates
of
the
cleanup
costs
for
the
sites.
it
was
determined
that
the
cleanup
costs
would
far
exceed
the
value
of
the
property
that
is
in
question
in
this
case.
it
was
also
determined
that
because
of
the
liens
against
the
property,
even
if
the
property
were
cleaned
up,
there
would
be
no
value
to
the
estate.
under
those
circumstances,
the
trustee
had
no
alternative.
he
was
obligated
by
the
duties
of
a
trustee
under
the
bankruptcy
code
to
seek
authorization
to
abandon.
the
bankruptcy
court
held
that
he
succeeded
in
establishing
the
grounds
of
burdensome
and
inconsequential
value
and
granted
the
application
to
abandon.
the
district
court
also
upheld
that
decision,
holding
that
the
language
of
section
554(a)
was
very
clear,
and
once
the
trustee
had
established
the
standards
of
burdensome
and
inconsequential
value,
the
court
could
not
look
to
any
additional
conditions
on
the
trustee's
right
to
abandon.
that
decision,
however,
was
reversed
by
the
third
circuit.
both
the
third
circuit
and
the
respondents
in
this
case
contend
that
the
right
of
abandonment
pursuant
to
section
554(a)
is
not
unconditional.
they
contend
that
section
554(a)
codified
a
body
of
pre-code
law
that
imposed
certain
conditions
upon
the
trustee's
right
of
abandonment,
and
specifically
a
public
safety
or
public
purpose
doctrine.
mr.
william
f.
mc
enroe
in
this
particular
case,
the
property
can
be
abandoned
to
anyone
with
a
possessory
interest.
in
this
case
it
would
be
abandoned
back
to
the
debtor,
quanta
resources
corporation,
and
it
would
remain
in
that
corporation.
mr.
william
f.
mc
enroe
well,
there
are
two
different
properties.
in
new
york
there
is
real
property
containing
the
oil.
there
are
substantial
liens
against
that
property
which
according
to
the
estimates
we
obtained
exceeded
even
the
fair
market
value
in
a
clean
state.
the
new
jersey
property
consists
of
personal
property.
the
site
was
leased
by
the
debtor.
there
are
liens
against
personal
property
of
the
debtor,
but
that
particular
site
is
owned
by
a
third
party.
mr.
william
f.
mc
enroe
that's
correct.
the
interpretation
urged--
mr.
william
f.
mc
enroe
--no,
it
is
not.
mr.
william
f.
mc
enroe
it
remains
in
the
debtor,
and
possession
and
title
after
abandonment
are
in
the
debtor.
mr.
william
f.
mc
enroe
title
does
not
change.
mr.
william
f.
mc
enroe
the
trustee
has
custody
of
the
property
while
it
is
in--
mr.
william
f.
mc
enroe
--that's
correct.
the
interpretation
of
section
554(a)
urged
by
the
respondents
is
wrong,
and
it
is
wrong
for
several
reasons.
first,
there
is
no
established
body
of
pre-code
law
which
imposed
the
conditions
on
the
right
of
abandonment
that
they
urge.
the
respondent
cites
to
this
court
two
isolated
cases,
the
cases
of
ottenheimer
versus
whittaker
and
in
re
louis
jones,
in
which
the
abandonment
power
was
conditioned.
however,
two
cases,
isolated
cases,
which
were
never
passed
upon
by
this
court
do
not
constitute
an
established
body
of
law.
moreover,
both
of
those
cases
specifically
recognize
that
at
the
time
abandonment
was
not
a
statutory
power.
abandonment
at
that
time
was
only
a
judge-made
rule
which
had
come
down
to
facilitate
the
administration
of
bankruptcy
states.
courts
recognized
that
in
weighing
the
merits
of
the
case,
the
judge-made
rule
would
have
to
give
in
the
case
of
the
public
welfare.
both
of
those
cases,
it
is
very
likely
that
both
of
those
cases
would
have
been
decided
differently
had
there
been
a
statutory
right
of
abandonment
at
that
time.
mr.
william
f.
mc
enroe
no,
your
honor,
other
than
the
burdensome
and
inconsequential
value
set
forth
in
the
statute.
as
far
as
the
facts
of
this
case
and
creating
a
nuisance,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
act
of
the
trustee
in
abandoning
creates
any
nuisance.
if
anything,
the
abandonment
by
the
trustee
allowed
the
environmental
agencies
to
correct
the
problem.
the
abandonment
by
the
trustee
avoids
the
possibility
of
a
nuisance
being
created.
mr.
william
f.
mc
enroe
in
all
cases,
the
analysis
by
the
trustee
would
be
the
same.
he
must
analyze
first
whether
the
property
in
question
is
of
any
value
to
the
estate
or
is
of
burdensome
nature
to
the
estate.
if
he
determines
that
that
property
is
of
no
value
to
the
estate,
then
it
is
his
obligation
to
proceed
with
an
application
for
abandonment,
which
is
upon
notice
to
the
applicable
bodies,
as
in
this
case
the
state
of
new
york,
the
state
of
new
jersey,
to
notify
them
of
the
imminent
danger.
without
any
disregard
for
the
trustee
in
this
case,
i
don't
think
a
trustee
is
in
a
position
where
he
is
going
to
be
able
to
fight
a
burning
fire.
it
is
his
duty
to
immediately
notify
the
appropriate
authorities
to
avoid
any
possibility
of
a
nuisance
being
created
or
danger
to
the
public.
mr.
william
f.
mc
enroe
yes.
mr.
william
f.
mc
enroe
i
think
the
bankruptcy
code
as
it
is
written
says
that
the
court
must
consider
only
the
standards
of
burdensome
and
of
inconsequential
value.
mr.
william
f.
mc
enroe
they
are
courts
of
equity,
but
in
doing
their...
exercising
their
equitable
powers,
they
cannot
act
contrary
to
the
bankruptcy
code.
and
think
that
would
be
acting
contrary
to
the
bankruptcy
code
if
the
property
was
valueless
to
the
estate
and
the
claims,
for
instance,
of
the
estate
agencies
here.
if
the
trustee
expended
money
in
any
way
on
those
sites,
he
would
be
giving
priority
to
their
claims
over
the
claims
of
other
debtors,
which
i
do
not
believe
he
has
the
power
to
do.
it
would
be
allowing
for
a
distribution
to
the
state
other
than
is
set
forth
in
the
bankruptcy
code.
well,
it
takes
time
to
go
through
the
process
of
deciding
whether
to
abandon,
to
file
the
petition,
and
to
have
the
hearing
conducted.
mr.
william
f.
mc
enroe
in
the
interim,
the
trustee
should
do
what
is
necessary
if
he
has
the
ability
to
do
so.
if
he
has
no
ability
to
comply
with
state
law
or
to
remedy
any
situations,
then
his
obligation
at
that
point
is
to
on
an
emergency
basis
seek
the
authorization
to
abandon
with
notice
to
the
appropriate
governmental
authorities
who
can
do
something
about
the
problem.
mr.
william
f.
mc
enroe
if
he
spends
money
in
the
interim?
yes,
it
is.
mr.
william
f.
mc
enroe
that's
correct,
it
would.
mr.
william
f.
mc
enroe
if
it
is
clear
that
the
asset
will
never
be
of
any
value
to
the
state,
that
the
cost
of
cleanup
will
exceed
the
value
of
the
estate,
and
in
a
clean
state
would
never
generate
any
benefit
for
the
estate.
mr.
william
f.
mc
enroe
then
he
would
clean
up
the
site.
mr.
william
f.
mc
enroe
if
it
is
clear
that
after
he
expended
the
assets
to
clean
up
the
site,
the
value
of
that
property
would
exceed
what
he
expended
on
it.
mr.
william
f.
mc
enroe
well,
that
is
a
different
situation.
it
has
to
be
clear
that
after
cleaning
up
the
site,
and
the
extent
of
the
liens
are
paid
off,
that
there
is
still
a--
mr.
william
f.
mc
enroe
--that's
correct.
mr.
william
f.
mc
enroe
that's
correct.
mr.
william
f.
mc
enroe
that
particular
asset,
again,
is
of
no
value
to
the
estate.
mr.
william
f.
mc
enroe
and
he
could
abandon.
an
example
may
be
in
this
case
the
debtor
also
owned
trucks.
mr.
william
f.
mc
enroe
the
trucks
contained
certain
residues
of
pcb's
which
in
order
to
sell
the
property
needed
to
be
cleaned
up.
the
trustee
did
undertake
that
duty
because
it
was
clear
that
even
after
cleaning
up,
and
after
paying
off
the
liens,
there
would
be
benefit
to
the
estate
upon
the
sale
of
those
trucks.
mr.
william
f.
mc
enroe
i
believe
that
is
the
distinction
there.
mr.
william
f.
mc
enroe
i
believe
it
would
depend
on
the
time.
for
instance,
here,
with
the
new
york
site
after
the
trustee
was
granted
the
right
to
abandon,
the
state
of
new
york
undertook
a
cleanup
on
this
site,
and
asserted
their
liens
for
the
property.
the
other
lienholders,
there
was
no
judicial
determination,
but
they
walked
away
from
the
property.
mr.
william
f.
mc
enroe
no,
once
the
property
was
abandoned,
and
the
bankruptcy
judge
recognized
that
when
he
refused
to
consider
that
issue,
once
it
was
abandoned
it
was
beyond
his
jurisdiction.
it
was
matter
of
state
law.
mr.
william
f.
mc
enroe
well,
that
involves
an
interpretation
of
state
law
and
the
rights
of
creditors,
which...
or
the
rights
of
lienholders,
which
is
not,
i
don't
believe--
mr.
william
f.
mc
enroe
--it
is
certainly
possible.
mr.
william
f.
mc
enroe
yes,
the
new
york
real
estate
was
subject
to
a
mortgage
lien.
two
mortgage
liens.
and
the
extent
of
those
liens
exceed
the
fair
market
value
of
the
property
even
in
a
clean
state.
mr.
william
f.
mc
enroe
that's
correct.
i
believe
in
determining
the
proper
construction
of
section
554(a)...
my
time
is
up,
your
honor.
thank
you.
