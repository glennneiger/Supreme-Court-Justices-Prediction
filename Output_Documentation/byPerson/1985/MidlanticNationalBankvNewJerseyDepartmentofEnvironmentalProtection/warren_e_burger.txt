first
this

in

department
of
environmental
protection.
mr.
mcenroe,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
mean
that
the
trustee
could
abandon
a
burning
building,
or
a
great
excavation
that
would
attract
a
nuisance
and
a
hazard?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
terrell.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
general
hermann.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
general
hermann,
do
you
think
the
equities
in
any
sense
enter
into
this
balance?
for
example,
obviously,
something
has
been
going
wrong
here.
now,
the
police
power
of
new
york
and
new
jersey
was
always
available
to
put
a
stop
to
it
a
long
time
ago,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
the
old
equity
doctrine
of
in
pari
delicto
would
encourage
comes
into
play
here
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired
now,
counsel.
ms.
jacobson.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
not
sure
i
track
that,
ms.
jacobson.
it
is
going
to
cost
millions
of
dollars
to
clean
up
this
problem,
and
that
absorbs
all
of
the
assets
that
the
preferred
creditors
are
looking
to.
how
do
you
way
that
that
doesn't
hurt
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
as
between
the
bank
and
the
state,
who
had
the
opportunity
to
correct
this
earlier?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
between
the
bank
and
the
state.
the
state...
you
have
been
talking
about
the
police
powers,
the
state.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
bank
has
put
some
money
in
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
should
the
bank
be
monitoring
this
thing,
or
should
the
state?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
police
powers
does
the
bank
have?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
