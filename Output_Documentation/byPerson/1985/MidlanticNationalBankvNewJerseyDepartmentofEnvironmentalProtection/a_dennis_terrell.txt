mr.
a.
dennis
terrell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
midlantic
national
bank
asked
this
court
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
third
circuit
because
in
its
opinion
the
third
circuit
decision
effectively
destroys
its
admittedly
valid
and
existing
security
interest,
and
the
inventory,
certain
equipment,
and
accounts
receivable
of
the
debtor.
midlantic
did
not
have
a
mortgage
on
any
of
the
land.
atlantic
had
a
mortgage
on
the
personality
of
the
debtor,
and
in
our
opinion
the
third
circuit
opinion
effectively
destroys
that
lien
by
mandating
that
the
trustee
use
available
funds
in
the
estate
for
cleanup
purposes
rather
than
to
pay
secured
liens.
mr.
a.
dennis
terrell
well,
justice
rehnquist,
here
we
have
an
estate
that
is
valued
at
about
$400,000.
we
have
a
new
york
cleanup
cost
which
admittedly
is
$2.5
million.
if
the
trustee
as
directed
by
the
third
circuit
is
to
clean
up
the
site,
clearly
the
$400,000
is
going
to
go
for
that
cleanup.
there
will
be
nothing
left
for
secured
creditors...
nothing
left
for
unsecured
creditors,
but
i
am
only
concerned
with
secured
creditors.
mr.
a.
dennis
terrell
our
lien
is
on
the
inventory
which
included
the
good
waste
oil
in
this
case,
certain
equipment
which
the
trustee
sold,
and
accounts
receivable,
of
which
there
were
none.
mr.
a.
dennis
terrell
it
did
not
in
so
many
words,
but
i
think
the
net
effect
of
their
opinion,
and
especially
footnote
11,
comes
down
to
that.
in
essence,
in
footnote
11,
they
found
that
there
was
no
taking
problem
by
finding
that
the
exercise,
by
subjecting
the
exercise
of
abandonment
to
the
cleanup
costs,
that
would
be
valid
regulatory
powers.
we
don't
think
that's
what
happened
at
all
here.
we
think
that
what
happened
is
that
by
expending
all
the
moneys
in
the
estate,
it
effectively
does
destroy
our...
and
that
is
why
we
are
here
before
you
today.
mr.
a.
dennis
terrell
first
of
all,
justice
o'connor,
our
lien
covered
personal
property
in
new
jersey,
and
personal
property
in
new
york,
but
it
never
got
that
far
because
that
personal
property
was
never
sold
by
the
trustee.
so,
our
lien
covered
only
personal
property
in
new
jersey.
mr.
a.
dennis
terrell
fine.
mr.
a.
dennis
terrell
yes,
i
do.
mr.
a.
dennis
terrell
under
state
law,
in
new
jersey,
our
lien
would
have
priority
to
any
other
liens,
including
that
of
the
state
of
new
york,
and
so
under
state
law,
if
the
corporation
went
defunct,
we
could
have
foreclosed
under
new
jersey
law
and
sought
sale
of
those
assets
to
pay
for
our
secured
interest.
i
do
not
know--
mr.
a.
dennis
terrell
--yes,
you
are
absolutely
right.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
new
jersey
does
have
such
a
state
law.
and
i
think
that
if
new
jersey...
if
the
dfp
in
new
jersey
came
in
pre-bankruptcy,
cleaned
up
that
site,
under
the
spill
act,
there
is
an
absolute
law
which
gives
them
a
first
priority.
if
they
clean
up,
and
if
they
assert
the
lien...
of
course,
they
didn't
do
that
in
this
case,
but
that
certainly
is
possible.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
but
in
the
facts
of
this
case,
if
quanta
had
not
gone
bankrupt,
and
the
state
did
not
clean
up,
there
is
no
question
but
that
midlantic
has
a
first
prior
lien
to
those
assets
on
which
it
has
a
lien.
that
is
what
the
third
circuit
decision
destroys,
we
believe.
mr.
a.
dennis
terrell
yes,
it
did.
it
covered
all
inventory.
he
did--
mr.
a.
dennis
terrell
--yes,
i
believe
state
law
permits
you
to
do
that.
i
think
the
t.p.
long
case
also
supports
that
position,
that
the
secured
creditor
can
pick
and
choose
among
the
security
he
wishes
to
foreclose.
i
think
this
court's
analysis
in
security
industrial
bank
is
where
one
must
begin
the
analysis
of
midlantic's
position
in
this
case.
as
the
court
well
knows,
in
that
case
this
court
did
not
reach
a
constitutional
issue
by
construing
the
statute
in
a
way
that
avoided
the
constitutional
issues.
we
believe
the
third
circuit
opinion
does
raise
a
constitutional
issue
of
taking
by
construing
554
in
a
way
that
we
don't
believe
congress
intended,
and
of
course
that
construction
was
to
condition
the
abandonment
power
on
compliance
with
state
environmental
laws.
under
security
industrial
bank,
we
believe
that
what
the
result
should
be
is
that
554
should
be
construed
not
to
be
so
conditional,
and
therefore
not
to
raise
the
taking
question.
that
is
what
the
court
held
in
security
industrial
bank.
that
is
what
we
think
has
to
be
done
here.
i
think
there
is
another
issue
that
overshadows
all
this.
all
of
the
briefs
from,
the
amicus
from
the
various
states,
the
dep
and
the
new
york
department
of
environmental
protection
stress
environmental
concerns,
and
midlantic
national
bank
is
not
here
saying
that
it
is
not
concerned
with
the
environment,
but
there
is
an
equal
and,
i
think,
just
as
valid
concern
with
the
commercial
side
of
public
policy.
it
is
certainly
in
the
interest
of
public
policy
to
have
commercial
lenders
lend
to
companies
and
lend
to
companies
in
environmentally
sensitive
industries.
but
if
those
companies
lend
to
those
businesses,
and
believe
they
have
a
security
interest
and
a
first
priority
lien,
and
that
lien
is
knocked
out
as
per
the
third
circuit
opinion,
i
think
we
are
going
to
find
that
financial
institutions
will
tread
very
lightly
in
this
field,
and
will
not
lend
to
these
companies.
i
don't
think
that's
what
congress
intended
by
the
abandonment
power,
and
i
think
that
is
an
interest
that
this
court
should
be
concerned
with,
just
as
it
is
concerned
with
the
environmental
aspect
of
this
case.
obviously,
it
is
a
balancing
act,
and
i
think
the
bankruptcy
act
under
554
did
occasion
that
balance,
and
the
balance
came
out
on
the
side
of
the
trustee
to
permit
him
to
abandon,
as
the
trustee's
counsel
pointed
out,
in
those
circumstances
where
the
property
is
either
burdensome
or
of
inconsequential
value
to
the
estate.
it
did
not
put
any
condition
on
that
power.
in
addition,
i
believe
it
should...
the
court
should
be
aware
that
there
are
other
alternatives
to
the
state
when
they
clean
up
sites
like
this.
the
trustee
isn't
the
only
pocket
here,
and
as
pointed
out,
i
believe,
by
judge
davida
in
the
bankruptcy
court
opinion
below,
the
trustee
didn't
create
the
situation.
the
secured
lenders
didn't
create
the
situation.
the
debtor
created
the
situation.
mr.
a.
dennis
terrell
if
the
debtor
is
in
bankruptcy,
that's
right.
you
get
relief
from
the
automatic
stay.
mr.
a.
dennis
terrell
no,
that
is
not
the
only
reason.
if
the
property
is
necessary
for
an
effective
reorganization--
mr.
a.
dennis
terrell
--straight
bankruptcy.
that's
right.
that
would
be
the
only
case.
if
there
was
equity
in
the
property,
then
the
bankruptcy
court
would--
mr.
a.
dennis
terrell
--well,
the
trustee
must
go
to
the
court
to--
mr.
a.
dennis
terrell
--certainly
that
happens
every
day
in
the--
mr.
a.
dennis
terrell
--well,
it
is
worth
more
than
the
personal
property,
but
there
was
a
combination
of
assets
here,
justice
white.
there
were
a
number
of
vehicles
on
which
there
were--
mr.
a.
dennis
terrell
--we
had
no
lien.
there
were
liens
by
the
gmac
or
whatever
the
truck
companies
were,
but
those
vehicles
on
which
we
had
no
lien
were
worth
a
lot
more
than
the
liens,
and
the
trustee
did
move
ahead
and
sell
those
vehicles.
mr.
a.
dennis
terrell
there
is,
as
i
indicated,
there
is
an
important
consideration
here
about
how
the
state
can
go
about
cleaning
up
the
site
other
than
reaching
into
the
pockets
of
either
the
trustee
or
secured
lenders.
certainly
here
there
are
landlords
involved
in
this
site.
the
quanta
site
in
new
jersey
was
a
leasehold
interest.
the
owners
of
that
site
are
still
existing,
and
own
the
site,
and
under
new
jersey's
environmental
laws,
they
certainly
have
responsibility
for
the
site.
the
state
and
federal
government
themselves
by
statute
have
provided
avenues
and
ways
to
proceed
to
clean
up
these
sites,
and
so
there
is
that
avenue
to
clean
up
the
site.
there
is
also
suits
that
happen
now
every
day
against
the
generators
of
these
wastes
on
these
sites.
the
generators
can
be
sued
or
can
be
coerced
into
paying
for
the
cleanup
of
these
sites,
so
that
it
seems
to
me
to
say
that
the
assets
of
the
estate
are
the
only
way
this
site
can
get
cleaned
up
really
does
not
focus
on
the
true
state
of
affairs
in
the
environmental
area.
there
is
another
overriding
concern
here,
i
believe,
for
secured
lenders
such
as
midlantic.
the
thrust
of
the
environmental
laws
is
to
place
upon
private
parties
initially
the
burden
to
clean
up
the
sites.
new
jersey
happens
to
be
a
state
where
there
are
a
lot
of
environmentally
sensitive
industries.
probably
there
is
as
much
cleanup
going
on
in
new
jersey
as
in
any
place
in
the
country.
certainly
these
companies,
if
they
are
to
seek
financing
for
these
businesses,
must
rely
upon
banks
such
as
midlantic
to
do
that.
midlantic,
if
they
are
going
to
finance
this
kind
of
industry,
certainly
has
a
legitimate
aim
in
having
its
lien
secured.
obviously
secured
loans
carry
less
interest.
obviously,
they
carry
less
risk.
and
obviously,
they
are
the
preferred
means
of
borrowing
both
from
the
borrower's
standpoint
and
the
lender's
standpoint.
by
allowing
the
third
circuit
opinion
to
stand,
it
seems
to
me
you
are
sending
the
signal
to
financial
institutions
that
you
must
beware
if
you
lend
to
environmentally
sensitive
industries.
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
the
signal
that
should
go
out
from
this
court.
i
believe
that
the
signal
should
be
that
financial
institutions
should
be
encouraged
to
finance
these
industries,
should
be
encouraged
to
finance
these
industries
so
that
they
can
take
care
of
their
environmental
problems
themselves.
by
permitting
the
third
circuit
opinion
to
stand,
that
signal
does
not
go
out
to
the
financial
community,
and
i
think
they
will
shy
away
from
these
kinds
of
industries.
mr.
a.
dennis
terrell
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
dennis
terrell
he
is
not
according
to
this
case.
no,
he
is
not.
mr.
a.
dennis
terrell
in
the
bankruptcy
court,
not
this
case
on
appeal,
there
was
a
separate
action
started
by
the
landlord.
basically
the
landlord
said
to
the
trustee,
i
want
a
lot
of
rental.
i
want
you
to
give
me
the
assets
in
the
estate
to
pay
me
for
the
rental
of
the
property
that
you
have
had
for
the
many
months
that
you
have
had
prior
to
abandonment.
the
dep
intervened
in
that
case
and
said,
no,
we
want
the
moneys
for
cleanup
costs.
midlantic
intervened
in
that
case
and
said,
no,
we
want
our
secured
lien
paid.
that
case
was
stayed
pending
resolution
of
this
matter
before
the
court,
so
while
the
landlord
is
not
here
before
you,
the
landlord
is
involved
in
the
bankruptcy
proceeding,
albeit
in
an
ancillary
proceeding.
mr.
a.
dennis
terrell
well,
he
claims
he
is
entitled
to
administrative
rent.
mr.
a.
dennis
terrell
yes,
he
claims
that
he
has
an
administrative
lien
for
rent,
but
his
claim
was
dismissed
by
the
bankruptcy
court,
and
that
is
all
the
farther
that
has
gotten.
it
has
not
gotten
any
farther
than
that.
mr.
a.
dennis
terrell
no,
he
did
not
claim
priority
over
our
lien,
but
he
claimed
an
administrative
lien.
mr.
a.
dennis
terrell
expenses.
that's
right.
mr.
a.
dennis
terrell
i
don't
disagree,
justice
stevens.
certainly
when
a
bank
loans
to
an
environmentally
sensitive
industry,
it
has
to
take
that
into
consideration,
but
i
don't
think
it
should
have
the
added
burden
that
when
it
thinks
it
has
a
secured
lien
on
its
assets,
it
has
to
worry
about
the
fact
that
if
this
company
goes
in
bankruptcy
with
the
third
circuit
opinion
on
the
books,
that
it
won't
have
a
lien
at
all.
i
think
that
is
the
signal
that
the
third
circuit
opinion
gives
to
the
financial
community
which
we
are
asking
this
court
to
reverse,
but
i
agree
with
you.
i
think
that
a
bank
in
the
environmentally
sensitive
area
has
to
be
concerned
about
that,
but
i
don't
think
it
should
have
the
added
concern
that
if
it
believes
it
has
a
security
interest
in
a
secured
lien
that
has
taken
all
the
steps
under
state
law
to
have
a
secured
lien,
that
it
should
worry
that
in
bankruptcy
that
lien
will
be
wiped
out,
and
that
is
what
we
believe
the
signal
is
from
the
third
circuit
opinion,
and
that
is
why
we
are
asking
this
court
to
reverse
that
third
circuit
opinion.
thank
you.
