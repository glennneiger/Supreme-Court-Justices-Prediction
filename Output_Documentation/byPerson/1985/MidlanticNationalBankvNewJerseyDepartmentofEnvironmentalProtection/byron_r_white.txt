justice
byron
r.
white
under
the
new
bankruptcy
act,
does...
i
know
under
the
old
title
was
vested
in
the
trustee.
is
it
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
not.
and
it
remains
in
the
debtor.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
and
before
and
after,
then,
the
technical
title--
justice
byron
r.
white
--yes.
but
what
interest
does
the
trustee
have?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
with
all
the
powers
to
do
with
it
what
the
bankruptcy
law
gives
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
may
be
true
about
what
the
trustee
should
do.
he
should
try
to
abandon,
but
what
about
the
judge?
what
about
the
court?
do
you
think
the
court
must
let
him
abandon
it
if
he
shows
it
is
a
burden?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
cannot
say,
well,
wait
a
minute,
you
can't
abandon
it
without
taking
some
precautions
against
having
this
property
be
a
public
danger?
justice
byron
r.
white
bankruptcy
courts
are
courts
of
equity,
i
suppose,
aren't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
he
has
some...
suppose
there
are
assets
in
the
estate
that
hopefully
would
be
distributed
later
to
pay
the
claims
of
unsecured
creditors,
but
while
he
is
waiting
for
the
action
on
the
abandonment
petition,
he
thinks
he
has
to
spend
some
money
to
keep
the
property
in
decent
shape,
and
he
spends
some
money.
is
that
an
administrative
expense?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
which
would
deplete
the
assets
available
to
unsecured
creditors,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
think
he
would
be
breaching
his
duties
if
he
used
those
free
assets
to
clean
up
the
site.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if...
so
it
means
that
he...
so
it
means...
well,
suppose
the
assets
available
to
creditors
are
plenty
to
clean
up
the
site,
and
the
site
would
then
be
worth
something.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
would.
would
you
say
then
that
he
could
use
the
assets
available
to
creditors,
other
creditors
to
clean
up
the
site?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
there
may
be
liens
on
the
property.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
creditors
would
then
just
have
an
interest
in
the
property
instead
of
the
other
assets.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
inconsistent
with
what
you
said,
isn't
it?
suppose
he
could,
by
selling
the
other
two
tanks,
he
could
clean
up
the
other
one.
and
it
would
be
of
some
use.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
wouldn't
be
settled
in
the
bankruptcy
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask,
when
a
secured
creditor
has
a...
well,
he
has
a
lien
on
real
or
personal
property,
and
he
wants
to
foreclose
the
debtors
in
bankruptcy,
you
must
get
permission
to
foreclose?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
only
time
you
wouldn't
get
it
is
if
the
property
is
worth
more
than
the
debt,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
this
is
straight
bankruptcy.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there
is
no
equity
in
the
property,
couldn't
the
trustee
say
if
the
secured
creditor
is...
couldn't
the
trustee
say,
i
want
to
abandon
this
property?
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
he
says,
i
want
to
abandon
this
property.
the
lien
on
it
is
worth
more
than
the
property.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
shouldn't
it
have
happened
in
this
case?
your
lien
is
worth
more
than
the
personal
property,
isn't
it?
or
not?
or
do
you
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
had
no
lien
on.
justice
byron
r.
white
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
would
be
an
unsecured
credit,
or
would
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
landlord.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
he
claim
priority
over
your
lien?
justice
byron
r.
white
expense.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
are
you
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you...
did
you
go
into
the
bankruptcy
court
and
attempt
to
have
this
effected?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
that
ground.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
you
wanted
to
effect
was
to
make
the
trustee
use
whatever
assets
he
had
to
minimize
the
danger.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
you
wouldn't
have
come
in
if
you
thought
he
was
absolutely
without
any
assets.
justice
byron
r.
white
assets
such
as...
some
of
the
assets
were
under
a
lien.
justice
byron
r.
white
after
the
abandonment.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
the
court
shouldn't
act
on
the
abandonment
petition
until
all
that
is
sorted
out?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
may
be
so,
but
what
do
you
mean,
you
have
to
have
a
hearing
to
see
what
assets
are
available?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
suggesting
that
the
abandonment
should
just
have
been
put
off,
so
that
the
trustee
could
continue
to
take
care
of
the
property
and
avoid
damage,
or
are
you
saying,
go
ahead
and
let
him
abandon
it,
but
then
the
trustee
would
have
to
spend
money
to
keep
the
property
from
deteriorating
after
abandonment?
which
are
you?
or
both?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
short
term?
pending
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
what
the
abandonment
power
says.
the
abandonment
power
focuses
on
the
property
the
trustee
wants
to
abandon.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
doesn't
affect
it
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
include...
your
insistence
is
that
even
with
respect
to
the
inventory
that
is
covered
by
the
bank
loan,
that
that
inventory
could
have
been
used
by
the
trustee
to
clean
up.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
are
making
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
do
you
think
new
york
shares
this
view,
that
it
could...
that
the...
even
the
assets
with
a
lien
on
it
could
be
dissipated,
not
dissipated,
but
used
to
clean
up?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
is
your
view,
too,
i
gather.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you
just...
considering
that
part
of
the
problem
of
preventing
further
deterioration,
if
the
trustee
is
going
to
have
to
maintain
guards
and
what-not,
that
means
that
he
can't
abandon
the
property.
but
he
certainly
isn't
going
to
spend
money
on
property
that
he
has
already
abandoned.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
just
means
essentially
that
if
you
must
spend...
if
you
must
prevent
the
property
from
deteriorating
further,
you
just
can't
abandon
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
it
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
must
use
whatever
assets
that's
available
to
the
trustee
to
prevent
that
hazard.
justice
byron
r.
white
a
pretty
strong
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you,
why
do
you
think
that
the
costs
of
cleanup
or
of
avoiding
some
public
health
hazard
should
be
paid
by
the
secured
and
unsecured
creditors?
it
is
one
thing,
i
suppose,
if
there
were
an
equity
in
the
property
to
make
the
stockholders
pay
for
it,
but
just
by
definition
this
is
a
bankrupt
company.
it
is
insolvent.
the
stockholders
no
longer
have
an
interest.
there
are
no
assets
available
to
them
whatsoever.
why
do
you...
you
think
it
is...
you
say
that
it
is
equitable
to
saddle
the
creditors
with
the
expense.
now,
why?
do
you
think
just
because
they
have
been
dealing
with
the
company?
they
took
the
risk?
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
both
the
secured
and
unsecured
creditors?
justice
byron
r.
white
were
there
any
wage
claims
in
this
case,
do
you
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
say
that
regardless
of
who
the
unsecured
creditor
is,
his
claim
should
be
subordinated
to
the
administrative
expense
of
cleaning
up.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
you
would
have
to
be...
you
certainly
would
be
implying
quite
a
variation
in
the
priority
structure
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
it
certainly
isn't
express
that
these
kinds
of
expenses
would
be--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
you
are
just
saying...
you
are
saying,
yes,
you
have
to
be
an
implied,
but
that
there
is...
it
certainly
is
the
right
approach
because
of
the
equitable
powers
of
the
court.
