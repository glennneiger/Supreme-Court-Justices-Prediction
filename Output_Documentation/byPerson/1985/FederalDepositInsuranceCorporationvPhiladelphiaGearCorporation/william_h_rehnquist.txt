justice
william

rehnquist
well,
mr.
rothfeld,
are
you
suggesting
in
your
description
of
this
note
that
it
was
not
therefore
a
promissory
note
within
the
language
of
the
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
saying
that
this
particular
note
was
not
a
promissory
note
within
the
language
of
the
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
rothfeld,
in
the
question
presented
in
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
the
question
is
whether
a
standby
letter
of
credit
is
a
deposit
within
the
meaning
of
12
usc
for
purposes
of
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation.
in
your
brief,
it
has
changed,
so
it
reads,
whether
an
unfunded
standby
letter
of
credit
is
a
deposit.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
just
don't
think
that
reads
the
statute
very
accurately,
because
up
to
the
proviso
it
talks
about
money
or
its
equivalent,
and
then
it
says
provided
that
without
limiting
the
generality
of
the
term
money
any
such
encounters
must
be
regarded
as
evidencing
the
receipt
of
the
equivalent
of
money
when
credit
or
issuing
checks...
in
exchange
for
checks
or
for
a
promissory
note.
it
seems
to
me
that
cuts
a
lot
of
the
ground
out
from
your
kind
of
common
sense
let's
talk
it
over
approach.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
slattery,
i
wonder
if
we
are
not
getting
into
kind
of
a
semantic
dispute.
certainly
as
long
as
congress
has
used
the
term
promissory
note
in
this
statute
defining
the
liabilities
of
the
fdic,
that
is
a
question
of
federal
law,
what
a
promissory
note
means
and
what
every
other
word
in
the
statute
means.
i
take
it
what
you
are
rejecting
is
the
government's
argument
that
when
congress
used
the
term
promissory
note
here
it
meant
something
quite
different
from
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
term
promissory
note.
