justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
question
about...
does
the
record
tell
us
what
happened
to
orion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
doesn't
tell
us
whether
the
bank
made
any
attempt
to
collect
on
this
note
against
orion,
does
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
or
the
liquidator
after
the
bank.
justice
john
paul
stevens
assuming
for
a
moment
it
is
still...
is
it
a
deposit,
do
you
think?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
follow
up,
because
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
position.
your
position,
of
course,
is
that
orion
is
the
depositor,
and
it
becomes
a
depositor
at
the
time
it
turns
over
the
instrument,
the
note.
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
client
didn't
make...
you
don't
claim
your
client
gave
anything
of
value
to
the
bank.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
only
deposit
that
has
been
made,
if
there
is
a
deposit,
is
the
delivery
of
the
promissory
note.
isn't
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
pursue
a
thought
i
didn't
quite
finish
on.
if
the
promissory
note...
the
promissory
note
is
still
central
to
your
claim
that
there
is
a
deposit,
is
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
must
it
not
be
a
promissory
note
upon
which
the
person
obtaining
the
credit
is
primarily
or
secondarily
liable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
is
it
not
essential
to
your
claim
that
orion
was
primarily
or
secondarily
liable
on
the
note
at
the
time
it
was
delivered
to
the
bank?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
wasn't,
was
it?
it
didn't
owe
the
bank--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--whether
it
created
a
present
obligation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
didn't
create
any
obligation,
did
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
it
created
the
same
kind
of
contingent
liability?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
an
industry
practice
to
issue
unqualified
promissory
notes
to
back
up
a
letter
of
credit?
it
seems
to
be
an
unlikely
kind
of
transaction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
that
point,
what
is
your
response
to
his
argument
that
there
are
a
lot
of
things
that
the
term
deposit
includes
that
are
not
what
an
old-fashion
note
of
deposit
is?
in
other
words,
checks
written
in
payment
of
services,
utility
bills,
and
all
that.
he
refers
to
them
on
page
15
of
his
brief.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
all
suggest
that
the
purpose
of
this
statute
was
to
extend
credit
to
a
number
of
bank
creditors
for
whom
no
deposit
in
the
old-fashioned
sense
had
been
made,
that
he
fits
into
that
general
class,
and
therefore
fits
into
the
overall
congressional
purpose.
that
is
as
i
understand
his
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
that
right?
supposing
there
had
been
a
default,
and
they
paid
out
half
of
the
amount
covered,
say
$75,000
on
it.
then
wouldn't
the
obligation
on
the
note
have
become
a
real
obligation
under
your
theory,
and
then
it
wouldn't
have
been
an
insured
deposit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
there
would
be
no
obligation
on
the
note
for
the
balance
that
had
not
been
paid
out
on
the
letter
of
credit.
