how
about
someone
who
took
without
knowledge?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
about
if
orion
wasn't
paid
and
collected
on
the
letter
of
credit
in
the
bank?
the
bank
could
surely
sue
the
maker
of
the
note.
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
note.
so
that
certainly
is...
the
note
is
not
just
a
nil.
it
certainly
is
a
meaningful
note.
it
represented
an
obligation.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
does
that
make
it
not
a
note?
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly,
and
i
still
don't
understand
why
it
is
that
just
by
calling
it
a
reimbursement--
justice
byron
r.
white
--would
you
be
here
arguing
if
this
note
didn't
have
the
conditions
attached
to
it
that
were
a
freely
negotiable
note,
like
any
other
note,
and
there
were
no
side
agreements
at
all,
just
a
promissory
note?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
be
here
making
this
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
this
case
doesn't
turn
upon
a
letter
of
credit
on
whether
this
letter
of
credit
was
the
kind
of
a
letter
of
credit
that
should...
that
the
fdic
should
pay
on.
justice
byron
r.
white
has
this
always
been
your
position
throughout
this
litigation?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
see
why
then
on
that
rationale
why
it
would
make
any
difference
if
this
note
was
an
ordinary
negotiable
promissory
note.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
argument
in
this
case
is
that
this
one
was
funded
by
the
promissory
note.
and
no
one
suggests...
there
is
no
argument
in
this
case
that
the
completely
unfunded
the
letter
of
credit
is
insured,
is
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
the
argument
here
is
that
this
note
funds
the
letter
of
credit
just
as
much
as
an
unrestricted
note.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
no
distinction
between
funded
and
unfunded?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
there
is
no
distinction
between
funded
and
unfunded
drawn
in
the
regulations?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
you
don't
need
to
convince
us
that
completely
unfunded
letters
of
credit
are
insured,
do
you?
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
say
that
if
it
takes
funding,
this
one
was
funded--
justice
byron
r.
white
--is
that
your
primary
argument?
are
you
making
the
general
submission
that
if
there
hadn't
been
any
funding
at
all,
no
promissory
note
by
orion
given
to
the
bank,
wouldn't,
as
you
say,
the
letter
of
credit
would
have
been
insured?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
really
are...
you
are
resting
on
the
fact
that
a
note
was
given.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
suppose
there
is
no
denying
that
there
was
no
liability
on
this
note
unless
the
bank
paid
out
some
money
to
the
holder
of
the
letter
of
credit.
justice
byron
r.
white
may
i
ask
you...
excuse
me.
go
ahead.
may
i
ask
you
in
that
connection,
what
if
the
note
on
its
face
said
this
instrument
does
not
create
any
present
obligation
to
pay
anything
to
the
bank.
it
merely
creates
an
obligation
in
the
event
that
orion...
the
bank
is
required
to
make
some
payments
to
philadelphia
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
the
note...
this
kind
of
a
note
in
this
context
didn't
give
the
bank
anything
that
it
wouldn't
have
had
without
the
note.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
bank
had
paid
out...
issued
the
letter
of
credit,
unfunded
letter
of
credit,
and
the
paydown
on
the
letter
could
have
recovered
its
payments
from
its
customer.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
and
so
he
sues
the
customer,
and
in
the
one
case
he
has
got
this
promissory
note.
in
the
other
case
he
hasn't
got
a
promissory
note.
he
has
just
got
the
uniform
commercial
code.
now,
what
is
the
difference
between
the
two
situations?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
just
talk
about
this
note
and
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
it
give
the
bank
that
the
bank
wouldn't
have
had
under
the
uniform
commercial
code?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
was
the
only
one
that
was
liable
on
the
note,
primarily
or
secondarily.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
can
you
say
it
is
liable
on
the
note
when
the
note
gives
rise
to
no
liability?
there
has
never
been
a
payout
to
philadelphia
gear.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
the
case
be
different
if
instead
of
a
promissory
note
there
was
just
a
long
written
agreement
describing
all
the
contingencies
pursuant
to
which
the
letter
of
credit
were
issued?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
that
the
fdic
for
half
a
century
has
consistently
disagreed
with
the
position
you
take
today?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
evidence
one
way
or
the
other
on
that
in
the
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
is
true
that
no
premiums
have
been
collected
by
fdic
on
notes
that
were
held
to
be
unfunded,
whatever
that
means?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
the
note
that
we
are
talking
about,
is
that
the
note
that
appears
at
page
27
of
the
joint
appendix?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
and
do
you
say
an
unconditional
note
would
qualify
for
insurance?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
the
bank
hadn't
failed,
but
there
was
some
payment
on
the
letter
of
credit
by
the
bank,
and
then
they
call
on
the
customer
to
pay.
and
they
sue...
and
he
doesn't
pay
and
they
sue
on
the
note.
they
do
collect
interest
just
by
the
terms
of
the
note.
