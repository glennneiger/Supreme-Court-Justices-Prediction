mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
a
narrow
one,
whether
a
standby
letter
of
credit
issued
by
a
bank
and
backed
by
a
contingent
note
provided
by
the
bank's
customer
represents
a
deposit
that
is
insured
by
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation.
while
this
question
obviously
is
a
technical
one,
reduced
to
its
essentials,
the
issue
here
is
actually
very
straightforward,
and
can
be
resolved
by
simply
bearing
in
mind
the
central
purpose
of
the
deposit
insurance
program,
protecting
funds
that
depositors
entrust
to
banks.
this
case
is
typical
of
commercial
transactions
that
make
use
of
so-called
standby
letter
of
credit
to
guarantee
credit
by
one
of
the
parties,
and
a
look
at
the
facts
of
the
transaction
here
may
help
put
the
issue
in
focus.
the
case
began
when
the
orion
manufacturing
corporation
arranged
to
purchase
materials
from
the
respondent.
to
guarantee
that
it
would
pay
for
the
materials
when
they
were
delivered,
orion
obtained
a
standby
letter
of
credit
from
the
penn
square
bank
for
the
benefit
of
respondent.
this
letter
of
credit,
like
all
letters
of
credit,
functioned
as
a
guarantee
mechanism,
and
worked
very
much
like
a
line
of
credit.
under
the
letter,
penn
square
was
obligated
to
pay
respondent
upon
the
receipt
of
respondent's
signed
statement
that
orion
hadn't
paid
its
bills
to
respondent
when
those
bills
came
due.
as
security
for
penn
square,
orion
gave
the
bank
a
contingent
so-called
backup
note
in
the
amount
of
the
letter
of
credit
which
the
bank
would
draw
upon
for
reimbursement
if
it
was
forced
to
pay
out
to
respondent
under
the
letter
of
credit.
although
this
note
was
labeled
a
promissory
note
and
on
its
face
appeared
uncontingent,
both
orion
and
penn
square
understood
that
nothing
would
be
considered
due
on
the
note
and
the
note
would
bear
no
interest
unless
and
until
the
bank
was
forced
to
pay
respondent
under
the
letter
of
credit.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that
is
correct,
although--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--essentially
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
think
that
the
note
here
functioned
simply
as
an
elaborate
reimbursement
agreement,
but
the
note
didn't
represent
any
actual
liability
on
the
part
of
the
maker
of
the
note.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
it
could
have
been,
arguably
could
have
been
negotiated
by
the
holder
of
the
note
on
its
face,
although
given
the
contingencies
attached
to
the
note,
it
is
difficult...
the
value
of
the
note
would
have
been
practically
nil.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think
there
are
two
points
to
make
in
response
to
that.
while
it
could
have
been
negotiated
to
a
holder
in
due
course,
as
justice
rehnquist
says,
anyone
who
took
the
note
with
knowledge
of
the
conditions
attached
to
it
between
the
parties
who
originally
were
involved
in
the
transaction
would
be
subject
to
the
defense
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
that
is
true.
anyone
who
took
with
knowledge
of
those
limitations
would
not
be
able
to
obtain
value
against
orion
based
on
the
note.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
someone
who
took
without
knowledge
arguably
would
be,
although--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that
is
true.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
again,
let
me
give
two
responses
to
that.
first,
the
note
certainly
was
meaningful
as
a
reimbursement
agreement
between
orion,
the
maker
of
the
note,
and
the
bank,
and
the
only
rights
the
bank
had
under
the
note,
given
the
whole
nature
of
the
transaction
here,
were
that
it
could
use
the
note
to
obtain
reimbursement.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
it
was
labeled
a
note.
it
can
be
termed
a
note.
the
question
that
we
are
addressing
here
is
whether
it
is
a
promissory
note
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
to
be
termed
a
note
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
what
precisely
congress
had
in
mind
in
drafting
the
statute
in
the
way
that
it
did.
congress
when
it
wrote
the
federal
deposit
insurance
act,
when
it
created
the
deposit
insurance
program,
was
legislating
against
the
background
of
depression
era
crisis
in
the
banking
community,
and
its
purpose
in
creating
the
program,
i
think
it
left
no
doubt
about
that,
was
to
protect
deposits.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
no,
if
there--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--no,
we
wouldn't,
your
honor.
if
this
note
were
a
fully
uncontingent
negotiable
note
that
were
not
limited
by
any
side
agreements,
it
would
be
a
note
backing
a
letter
of
credit
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that
is
correct.
if
it
was
an
uncontingent,
fully
enforceable
note
which
created
a
present
obligation
on
the
part
of
orion,
then
it
would
be
as
good
as
orion's
money,
which
orion--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--for
us,
the
case
turns
on
whether
this
was
a...
i
suppose
that
is
right,
justice
o'connor,
whether
or
not
this
is
a
contingent
or
uncontingent
instrument.
i
think
an
example--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--no,
they
didn't,
your
honor,
although
the
court
of
appeals
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
it
was
in
fact
a
controlling
agreement
between
penn
square--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that
is
correct,
justice
white.
in
our
view
the
case
turns
on
whether
the
letter
is
funded
or
unfunded,
not
what
appears
on
the
face
of
the
letter,
but
whether
the
depositor,
the
bank's
customer
gives
the
bank
funds
or
something
that
is
equivalent
to
funds
that
backs
the
letter.
it
is
only
when
the
bank's
depositor
actually
gives
the
bank
something
of
value--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--it
has
been
our
position.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that
i
think
is
done
simply
for
purposes
of
clarity,
justice
rehnquist,
because
standby
letters
of
credit--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--no,
that's...
i
should
make
myself
clear.
it
is
not
whether
security
backs
up
the
note.
the
note
can
be
secured
or
unsecured.
the
question
is
whether
the
note
is
contingent
or
uncontingent,
whether
or
not
the
note
creates
a
present
absolute
liability
on
the
part
of
the
maker
of
the
note
or
whether
it
doesn't,
and
that,
i
think,
ties
into
what
justice
rehnquist
is
concerned
about,
whether
or
not
the
letter
of
credit
is
funded
or
unfunded.
standby
letters
of
credit
are
invariably
unfunded,
and
we
put
the
term
unfunded
in
simply
to
make
clear
that
we
are
talking
about
whether
or
not
there
are
funds
in
the
bank
supporting
the
letter
or
credit
of
not.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
think
you
do,
justice
o'connor.
i
think
the
question
is
whether
the
bank's
customer
here,
orion,
provided
a
promissory
note
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
in
exchange
for
a
bank
instrument
such
as
a
letter
of
credit.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
orion
has
attained
it
for
the
benefit
of
respondent,
philadelphia
gear.
orion
is
the
bank's
customer.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
the
bank
would
be
obtaining
the
promissory
note.
it
would
be
the
person
who
obtains
the
letter
of
credit,
and
the
bank
here
issued
the
letter
of
credit
for
its
customer,
orion,
although
the
beneficiary
of
the
letter
of
credit
was
a
third
party.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that,
i
think,
refers
to
the
bank,
the
bank
receiving
the
promissory
note
in
exchange
for
the
letter
of
credit.
the
focus
of
section
1813(l)(1)
defines
the
term
deposit
and
the
deposit
insurance
program
as
a
whole
is
whether
the
bank
has
received
something
of
value
which
it
is
holding
for
its
customer,
and
it
is
put
at
risk
in
the
event
of
a
bank
failure,
and
that
is
why
the
nature
of
the
note
in
our
view
is
important
here.
i
think
an
example
may
make
our
position
clear.
if,
for
example,
a
customer
gives
a
bank
a
$1,000
uncontingent
promissory
note
in
exchange
for
a
bank
instrument
such
as
a
certificate
of
deposit,
which
is
one
of
the
instruments
listed
with
letters
of
credit
in
the
deposit
definition,
and
the
bank
then
fails,
the
customer
will
have
lost
$1,000.
the
certificate
of
deposit
will
have
lost
its
value,
and
the
promissory
note,
which
is
uncontingent,
will
end
up
in
the
hands
of
the
bank's
receiver,
who
will
be
free
to
collect
$1,000
in
cash
from
the
bank's
customer.
the
bank's
customer
will
be
in
the
same
position
as
if
he
had
given
the
bank
$1,000
cash
for
the
certificate
of
deposit,
had
lost
that
$1,000
when
the
bank
failed.
that
customer
obviously
is
entitled
to
the
protection
of
deposit
insurance.
in
contrast,
if
the
bank
customer
gives
the
bank
a
contingent
backup
note
of
the
kind
at
issue
here
in
exchange
for
a
letter
of
credit
or
a
line
of
credit
and
the
bank
fails,
the
customer
has
lost
nothing.
he
can
no
longer
draw
on
the
letter
of
credit
or
the
line
of
credit,
but
he
will
never
have
to
pay
out
on
the
note,
because
the
note
will
end
up
in
the
hands
of
the
bank's
receiver.
it
will
be
essentially
in
the
position
of
the
bank.
it
will
be
unable
to
collect
on
it,
because
the
bank
has
never
paid
out
on
the
line
of
credit
or
the
letter
of
credit.
he
will
not
have
lost
money
or
its
equivalent,
which
is
the
central
definitional
phrase
in
the
statutory
language.
he
won't
be
out
of
pocket
a
cent.
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
line
of
credit
situation,
it
is
obvious
that
the
customer
shouldn't
be
able
to
demand
that
the
fdic
insure
his
right
to
draw
on
a
line
of
credit,
but
that
essentially
is
what
respondent
was
asking
for
here,
because
a
standby
letter
of
credit
is
in
essence
a
line
of
credit
that
the
customer
gets
for
the
benefit
of
the
third
party.
so,
again,
the
crucial
question
here
is
whether
the
customer
of
the
bank
has
deposited
anything
within
the
bank,
whether
the
bank
is
holding
something
that
is
put
at
risk
in
the
event
the
bank
becomes
insolvent,
and
that
is
lost
when
the
bank
actually
fails.
the
statutory
language
is
somewhat
convoluted
here.
there
certainly
is
no
doubt
that
when
congress
created
the
program
against
the
background
of
the
bank
failures
during
the
depression
and
against
the
runs
on
banks
and
ultimately
against
the
national
bank
holiday
in
1933,
congress
had
absolutely
no
doubt
about
what
it
was
trying
to
accomplish.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
think
what
is
crucial
is
whether
or
not
the
note
is
as
good
as
money
to
the
depositor
at
the
time
that
he
finally
gives
it
to
the
bank
in
exchange
for
one
of
these
bank
instruments.
it
is
the
instrument,
the
letter
of
credit,
the
certificate
of
deposit,
or
whatever,
which
is
insured,
and
the
question
is
whether
that
is
backed
by
something
held
by
the
bank
that
the
customer
will
lose
if
the
bank
fails.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
think
that
it
is
fairly
clear
from
the
background
of
this
deposit
definition
that
the
fdic
put
that
proviso
in
its
original
regulatory
definition
of
deposit,
and
congress
borrowed
it
and
put
it
in
1813(l)(1)
simply
to
make
it
clear
that
deposits
include
things
in
addition
to
cash,
that
anything
of
value
that
is
given
to
and
entrusted
to
a
bank
that
is
put
at
risk
and
is
lost
when
the
bank
fails
is
entitled
to
the
benefits
of
deposit
insurance.
and
that
is
why
it
listed
checks
and
drafts,
which
create
unconditional
liability
which
are
as
good
as
cash
to
the
depositor,
an
promissory
notes
were
put
in
for
the
same
purpose,
because
the
depositor
who
gives
an
uncontingent
promissory
note
to
the
bank
may
as
well
have
given
the
bank
cash.
and
in
fact,
as
we
explain
in
our
brief,
in
the
1930's,
at
the
time
when
this
original
definition
was
first
written,
it
was
understood
that
for
a
variety
of
purposes
the
term
promissory
note
should
not
be
deemed
to
include
contingent
notes.
the
federal
reserve
used
such
a
definition
for
its
discount
purposes,
for
example.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
again,
i
think,
justice
powell,
that
it
would
be
funded
only
if...
well,
that
you
would
have
to
look
at
the
note
itself
and
decide
whether
or
not
the
note
created
an
uncontingent
liability,
whether
or
not--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--in
our
view,
the
question
would
be
whether
the
letter
of
credit
rather
than
the
note
is
funded.
that
would
be
the
crucial
question.
whether
or
not
the
note
was
secured
by
situations
such
as
you
describe
wouldn't
make
any
difference
so
long
as
the
note
was
uncontingent.
the
note,
the
note
itself
is
the
funding,
which
is
the
money
or
its
equivalent
which
is
insured,
if
i
am
making
myself
clear.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that
is
correct.
i
think
that
is
absolutely--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--our
view
is
that
if
the
letter
of
credit
is
uncontingent,
and
creates
an
absolute
liability
which
to
the
depositor
is
as
good
as
cash,
that
that
is
enough
to
make
it
the
equivalent
of
money
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
congress,
i
think,
was
concerned
with
people
giving
things
like
that
to
banks
and
being
at
risk
in
the
event
that
the
bank
failed,
but
they
would
have
lost
the
face
value
of
that
note
if
someone
would
be
able
to
collect
it
against
them.
i
think
that
was
the
clear
congressional
understanding,
clear
regulatory
understanding
when
this
definition
was
first
promulgated
in
1935,
and
it
was
the
congressional
understanding
when
congress
took
that
regulatory
definition
and
put
it
in
the
statute.
in
fact,
when
the...
the
fdic
originally
promulgated
that
particular
language,
the
language
that
justice
rehnquist
focused
on,
must
be
regarded
as
the
equivalent
of
money
in
1935,
immediately
after
the
creation
of
the
deposit
insurance
program,
and
from
that
time
the
fdic
has
consistently
informally
but
publicly
and
consistently
taken
the
position
that
unfunded
letters
of
credit
are
not
insured
because
they
do
not
have
value
put
in
the
bank
which
is
at
risk
in
the
event
of
a
bank
failure.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
no,
i
don't
think
there
is,
justice
white.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that
is
true.
that
is
the
argument.
but
our
submission
is
that
that
argument
is
wrong.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that
is
absolutely
correct,
your
honor,
and
again,
i
can
provide
an
example
which
i
think
may
make
our
position
clear.
even...
i
suppose
i
should
break
this
into
two
parts.
the
first
is
that
if
the
letter
of
credit
was
drawn
upon
and
there
was
no
funding,
there
was
no
backing
at
all,
no
reimbursement
agreement,
no
note,
no
anything,
orion,
the
maker...
well,
orion,
the
customer
who
obtained
the
letter
of
credit,
would
still
be
obligated
as
a
matter
of
commercial
law
under
the
ucc
to
reimburse
the
bank
for
whatever
the
bank
paid
out
on
the
letter
of
credit
under
article
5,
section
114.
the
fact
that
that
obligation
is
firmed
up
by
a
written
reimbursement
agreement
or
by
a
contingent
note
doesn't
change
the
nature
of
the
transaction
at
all.
the
fact
remains
nothing
was
put
in
the
bank.
there
were
no
funds
given
to
the
bank.
the
bank
never
held
anything.
and
in
fact,
given
the
way
the
transaction
here
was
structured,
it
was
impossible
ever
for
the
bank
to
have
held
onto
its
customers'
money
for
any
period
of
time,
because
the
bank
could
only
draw
on
the
note
after
it
had
already
paid
an
equivalent
amount
of
money
to
respondent,
so
it
would
simply
have
been
drawing
on
the
note
for
reimbursement
for
its
own
funds
which
it
had
spent
to
cover
the
letter
of
credit
giving
it
to
respondent.
it
seems
clear
that
that
could
not
be
the
purpose
of
the
federal
deposit
insurance
program,
because
there
was
no
deposit,
there
was
no
money
given
to
the
bank,
there
was
no
asset
at
risk
in
the
event
that
the
bank
failed,
and
nothing
was
lost
by
the
bank's
customer
when
the
bank
failed.
as
i
suggested
before,
the
fdic
has
consistently
taken
this
position
since
the
very
language
that
the
court
is
focusing
on
was
put
in
the
regulatory
definition.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
am
not
aware
of
any
claims
for
insurance
under
such
a
letter.
the
fdic,
however,
has
never
assessed
an
insurance
premium
on
such
an
unfunded
letter
of
credit.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
other
than
this
litigation
and
the
currently
ongoing
litigation
in
the
sixth
circuit,
i
am
not
aware
of
any
claim
in
which
that
has
arisen,
although
in
the
1950's,
even
before
the
statutory
definition
was
put...
well,
even
before
the
proviso
was
put
in
the
statute,
the
district
court
of
new
york
recognized
and
endorsed
the
fdic's
view
that
it
is
only
when
the
depositor
puts
his
money
at
risk
to
back
a
letter
of
credit
that
the
letter
is
insured.
it
was
the
urban
trust
case,
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
and
which
was
cited
to
congress
at
the
time
that
congress
put
the
definition
in
the
statute
as
it
now
appears.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that
is
absolutely
correct,
your
honor,
whether
or
not
this
instrument
was
negotiable,
it
was
not
an
immediate
obligation
of
the
maker
of
the
instrument,
and
the
maker
of
the
instrument
was
not
liable
to
pay
out
any
funds.
to
the
extent
that
the
bank
attempted
to
negotiate
and
succeeded
in
negotiating
this
instrument
to
a
holder
in
due
course
who
is
unaware
of
this
underlying
transaction,
the
bank
would
have
defrauded
its
customer,
and
the
customer
would
be
able
to
have...
would
have
a
cause
of
action
against
the
bank
for
reimbursement
and
was
forced
to
pay
out
on
the
note.
so
the
customer
never
had
any
of
its
funds
at
risk
during
the
course
of
this
transaction
at
any
point.
it
seems
perverse
to
insist
that
the
deposit
insurance
program
protect
this
type
of
transaction.
it
would
simply
make
the
federal
government
the
guarantor
of
business
transactions
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--it
does
not,
your
honor.
my
understanding
is
that
orion
is
now
insolvent,
but
that
is
not
reflected
in
the
record.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
the
bank
did
not
attempt--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--no,
it
does
not.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
again,
let
me
make
two
points
in
response
to
that,
justice
blackmun.
first,
it
would
not
reduce...
it
would
not
remove
all
letters
of
credit
from
protection
of
deposit
insurance.
it
would
only
remove
unfunded
letters
of
credit.
it
would
preserve
something
very
much
like
the
current
section
1813(l)(3),
which
specifically
provides
for
funded
letters
of
credit.
secondly,
as
far
as
i
am
aware,
no
action
has
been
taken
on
that
bill.
it
has
been
introduced,
but
there
has
been
no
action
on
it.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
our
view
is
that
there
must
be
a
deposit
either
of
funds
or
of
the
equivalent
of
funds.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that
is
correct,
justice
powell,
and
let
me
expand
on
it
just
a
little
bit.
to
the
extent
that
the
funds
don't
cover
the
face
amount
of
the
letter
of
credit,
the
letter
would
be
insured
to
whatever
extent
funds
were
in
the
bank
backing
it.
the
second
point
is
that
there
must
be
a
deposit
backing
a
letter
of
credit,
but
whether
or
not
that
deposit
was
actually
cash
given
to
the
bank
or
an
uncontingent
promissory
note
or
a
check
or
a
draft,
it
would
be
insured
nonetheless,
but
there
must
be
something
which
is
equivalent
of
money
given
to
the
bank.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
at
the
moment,
i
will
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
a
couple
of
points,
your
honor,
which
i
will
try
to
make
quick.
first,
as
to
the
crucial
question,
the
meaning
of
a
promissory
note
in
a
case,
that
clearly
must
be
defined
by
reference
to
federal
law,
and
it
must
be
determined
in
light
of
the
meaning
of
the
statute
and
the
congressional
purpose.
it
can't
be
enough
if
something
is
a
promissory
note
that
it
has
the
term
promissory
note
written
across
the
top.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
which...
and
the
note
is
characterized
explicitly
as
a
backup
note
to
the
letter
of
credit,
which
clearly
indicates
that
it
is
to
be
drawn
upon
only
when
the
letter
of
credit
is
itself
drawn
upon.
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
why
congress
would
have
wanted
to
insure
a
letter
of
credit
that
is
backed
by
this
sort
of
contingent--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
should
make
two
points
in
response
to
that,
your
honor.
first,
so
far
as
1813(l)(1)
itself
is
concerned,
which
is
the
part
of
the
statute
that
is
at
issue
here,
everything
is
defined
in
terms
of
money
or
its
equivalent,
and
it
is
very
difficult
to
imagine
why
congress
would
have
wanted
to
list
something
like
an
incontingent
note
to
say
that
it
must
be
regarded
as
money
or
its
equivalent.
as
to
the
instruments
that
the
respondent
has
listed,
those
all
appear
in
section
1813(l)(4)
of
the
statute,
which
is
the
only
part
of
the
deposit
definition
that
is
not
put
in
terms
of
money
or
its
equivalent.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
again,
i
think
there
are
several
points
to
make
in
response
to
that.
first,
the
types
of
instruments
listed
in
section
1813(l)(4)
are
all
things
for
which
the
bank
generally
has
received
cash,
such
as
a
cashier's
check,
or
has
received
services,
has
received
some
value
for
someone.
and
again,
congress
singled
out
those
types
of
bank
instruments
such
as
cashier's
checks
as
the
only
things
which
were
not
defined
in
terms
of
money
or
its
equivalent
received
or
held
by
the
bank.
so
those,
i
think,
to
the
extent
that
they
they
don't
fall
into
the
category
of
claims
that
the
fdic
is
talking
about
are
in
a
special
separate
category,
and
congress
recognized
that.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that
is
correct,
justice
white.
an
unconditional
loan
is
money
or
its
equivalent
in
a
meaningful
sense
to
the
depositor
of
the
note.
it
appears
that
the
respondent's
explanation
as
to
why
this
note
should
be
treated
as
money
or
its
equivalent
is
that
it
gives
the
bank
additional
rights
to
reimbursement
it
was
forced
to
pay
out
on
the
letter
of
credit,
but
the
crucial
point
there
is
that
he
is
talking
about
reimbursement
of
the
bank's
own
funds
that
the
bank
has
paid
out.
it
is
not
customer's
funds
that
the
customer
has
given
to
the
bank.
those
funds
don't
have
to
appear
in
the
form--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--under
the
terms
of
the
note
they
would,
although
it
is
not
clear
what
the
side
agreement
in
this
case
would
have
provided
for.
but
in
any
event
that
is
really
simply
like
a
reimbursement
agreement
that
provided
for
interest.
whether
or
not
it
is
a
note
is
irrelevant.
in
fact,
the
logic
of
respondent's
argument
reduces
the
note
to
irrelevancy.
it
is
simply
the
fact
that
the
lawyers
for
the
parties
to
this
transaction
happen
to
make
use
of
something
in
the
form
of
a
note
and
wrote
promissory
note
across
the
top.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
again,
the
particulars
of
the
agreement
between
orion
and
the
bank
aren't
clear
for
the
record,
but
to
the
extent
that
the
note
would
have...
to
the
extent
the
bank
could
have
drawn
on
the
note
for
reimbursement
only
for
what
it
has
paid
out,
again,
it
is
simply
getting
reimbursement
for
its
own
funds
that
it
has
paid
out.
there
has
been
no
commitment
of
funds
that
the
bank
is
holding.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
again,
that
is
the
crucial
question.
thank
you.
