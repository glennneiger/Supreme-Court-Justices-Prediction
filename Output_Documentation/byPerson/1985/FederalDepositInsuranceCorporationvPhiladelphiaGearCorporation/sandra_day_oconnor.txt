is
that
because
there
was
a
side
understanding
setting
forth
certain
contingencies?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
it
make
any
difference
at
all
whether
the
note
bore
interest
or
not,
or
was
in
fact
easily
negotiable
because
of
its
lack
of
interest?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
on
its
face,
of
course,
it
did.
theoretically,
it
would
have
been
negotiable
at
a
discount
for
money.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
due
course.
it
certainly
wouldn't
be
of
no
value
if
the
market
could
just
discount
it
to
make
up
for
the
lack
of
interest.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
are
not
a
holder
in
due
course
if
you
do
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
regardless
of
whether
orion
had
given
a
lien
or
any
backup
security
for
the
note?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
for
you
the
whole
case
turns
on
whether
there
is
a
side
contingency
agreement?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
just
told
me
it
didn't
make
any
difference
whether
there
was
security
backing
up
the
note,
that
it
made
no
difference.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
looking
at
the
statute,
the
relevant
statute,
it
says
the
unpaid
balance
of
money
or
its
equivalent
up
in
the
first
part
of
the
sentence,
and
then
it
says
provided
that,
without
limiting
the
generality
of
the
term
money
or
its
equivalent.
we
regard
an
instrument
as
the
equivalent
of
money
if
it
is
issued
in
exchange
for
a
promissory
note
upon
which
the
person
obtaining
any
such
credit
or
instrument
is
primarily
or
secondarily
liable.
does
that
provide
that
that
sentence
just
drop
out
of
the
case
because
philadelphia
gear
is
not
liable
on
the
orion
promissory
note?
do
we
even
have
to
concern
ourselves
with
that
last
proviso?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
the
person
obtaining
such
credit
or
instrument...
who
is
the
person
obtaining
the
credit
or
instrument?
i
thought
it
was
orion.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
it
the
person
obtaining
the
promissory
note
or
the
person
obtaining
the
letter
of
credit
referred
to
in
that
phrase?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
i
am
just
asking
whether
the
language
in
the
statute
refers
to
the
person
obtaining
the
promissory
note
or
the
person
obtaining
the
letter
of
credit.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
have
there
been
other
claims
like
this
which
the
fdic
has
routinely
rejected?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
are
aware
of
no
examples
like
this
where
they
had
a
claim
that
has
been
made
for
the
recovery
of
insurance
which
has
been
denied?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
slattery,
do
you
think
that
the
fdic's
long-standing
decision
not
to
charge
insurance
premiums,
in
effect,
for
unfunded
or
for
standby
letters
of
credit
constitutes
an
administrative
interpretation
of
the
act
which
we
owe
some
deference
in
resolving
this
question?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
has
to
be
a
decision,
in
effect,
not
to
collect
insurance
premiums.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
statute
refers
to
promissory
note.
and
you
just
stop
there.
you
say,
well,
this
is
a
promissory
note.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
what
the
sg
in
effect
is
saying
is
that
the
term
promissory
note
should
be
defined
in
terms
of
federal
law,
not
ordinary
state
commercial
law,
that
promissory
note
has
a
federal
definition,
and
in
this
context
that
federal
definition
means
there
can't
be
side
contingencies
attached
to
it.
now,
what
is
your
response
to
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
it
is
just
possible
that
penn
square
bank
had
some
looser
banking
practices
than
one
might
normally
find.
