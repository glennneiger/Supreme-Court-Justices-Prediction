justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
this
question?
you
used
the
term
unfunded
note.
let's
assume,
for
example,
that
the
note
were
secured
by
a
second
mortgage
on
unimproved
real
estate
supported
by
some
appraisal
as
to
the
estimated
value
of
that
real
estate.
would
that
be
funding?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
assume
the
note
on
its
face
was
not
contingent,
but
it
was
funded
in
the
sense
of
security
having
been
provided
rather
than
having
a
deposit
in
equal
amount
of
the
note
or
perhaps
getting
a
government
bond
or
something
that
was
absolutely
a
gold-plated
security,
it
gave
something
that
was
perhaps
speculative
or
at
least
subject
to
a
good
deal
of
litigation
before
you
could
realize
on
it.
i
don't
know.
i
was
just
posing
that
question.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
you
get
back
to
whether
there
was
any
basic
value
in
the
deposit,
don't
you,
as
to
whether
or
not
the
letter
of
credit
was
funded
by
anything
that
made
it
the
equivalent
of
money.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--question
of
fact,
i
would
suppose.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
come
back
to
what
constitutes
an
unfunded
letter
of
credit?
is
there
any
definition
in
the
regulations?
or
has
the
fdic
ever
identified
a
definition
of
it?
i
think
you
are
arguing
about
a
standard
that
there
has
to
be
a
deposit
in
the
face
amount
of
the
letter
of
credit.
is
that
the
position?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
you
can
fund
in
various
ways,
but
you
are
saying
that
the
only
acceptable
funding
based
on
50
years
of
history
and
practice
is
where
a
deposit
in
the
amount
of
a
letter
of
credit
is
available
to
make
sure
it
is
paid.
is
that
correct?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
this
question?
did
your
client,
the
philadelphia
gear
corporation,
know
that
a
promissory
note
had
been
deposited,
had
been
delivered
to
the
bank?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
did
not?
so
it
did
not
rely
on
the
existence
of
that
one
way
or
the
other?
