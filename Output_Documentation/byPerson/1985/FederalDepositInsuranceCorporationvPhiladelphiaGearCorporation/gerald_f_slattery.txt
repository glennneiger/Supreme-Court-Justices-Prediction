mr.
gerald
f.
slattery,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
begin,
if
i
may,
with
an
answer
to
a
question
justice
o'connor
posed
to
the
solicitor
general.
you
asked,
i
believe,
justice
o'connor,
whether
the
statutory
words,
the
person
obtaining
any
such
credit
or
instrument,
refers
to
the
bank's
customer
or
to
the
beneficiary
of
the
letter
of
credit.
the
words
refer
to
the
bank's
customer,
orion,
and
the
words
mean
in
respondent's
view
the
person
at
whose
request
the
bank
issues
the
letter
of
credit
to
the
beneficiary.
and
the
primary
or
secondary
liability
reference,
of
course,
refers
to
the
customer's
liability
on
the
promissory
note
that
he
has
delivered
to
the
bank.
further,
in
regard
to
a
question
that
justice
blackmun
asked
about
the
status
of
s.
750,
which
has
recently
been
introduced
by
senator
jake
garn
at
the
fdic's
request
and
is
now
before
the
senate
committee
on
housing,
banking,
and
urban
affairs.
i
believe
that
the
text
of
that
bill
removes
all
letters
of
credit
from
the
protection
of
the
deposit
insurance
program,
not
merely
on
funded
letters
of
credit.
i
recall
reading
an
official
version
of
the
bill,
and
i
also
recall
that
the
trade
publication
that
the
fdic
cites
in
its
reply
brief
letter
of
credit
update
contains
the
text
of
the
bill.
if
memory
serves
me
correctly,
i
believe
the
bill
completely
removes
letters
of
credit
not
just
unfunded
letters
of
credit,
but
all
letters
of
credit
from
the
ambit
of
the
protection
of
the
deposit
insurance
program.
the
fdic--
mr.
gerald
f.
slattery,
jr.
--i
do
not,
your
honor.
the
fdic
has
made
the
statement
in
its
opening
brief
that
it
has
never
assessed
letters
of
credit
of
the
sort
that
were
issued
to
respondent
in
this
case,
nor
has
it
ever
paid
claims
on
letters
of
credit
of
this
sort.
i
believe
it
is
problematic
at
best
whether
the
failure
by
the
fdic
to
assess
deposit
insurance
premiums
is
purposeful
or
unconsidered.
i
believe
it
was
unconsidered
because
i
cannot
believe
that
a
purportedly
long-standing
and
consistent
administrative
interpretation
could
completely
escape
mention
in
any
of
the
legislative
or
regulatory
history
of
the
statutes.
but
that
is
the
case
here.
one
may
quarrel
with
the--
mr.
gerald
f.
slattery,
jr.
--as
i
say,
your
honor,
it
is
problematic.
it
appears
that
there
was
some
vague
and
undefined
notion
within
the
fdic
that
standby
letters
of
credit,
for
example,
may
not
have
been
subject
to
deposit
insurance
programs
while
commercial
letters
of
credit
may
have
been.
that,
at
least,
is
the
suggestion
made
in
the
reply
brief.
that
is
a
distinction
without
a
difference,
however,
because
it
appears
from
earlier
regulations
that
the
fdic
has
provided
that
that
is
not
a
basis
upon
which
to
distinguish
funded
from
unfunded
letters
of
credit.
it
appears
from
assessment
decision
number
109,
for
example,
that
virtually
all
letters
of
credit
are
unfunded,
commercial
and
standby.
in
assessment
decision
number
109...
i
am
paraphrasing,
but
i
believe
my
paraphrase
is
very
close
to
the
actual
words
of
the
regulation...
the
fdic
stated
that
commercial
letters
of
credit
normally
are
not
sold
for
cash,
but
are
issued
against
an
agreement
to
reimburse
the
bank
for
drafts
paid
on
the
letter
of
credit.
the
fdic
goes
on
to
say
in
that
assessment
decision
number
109
that
if
that
reimbursement
agreement
does
not
constitute
a
promissory
note,
then
in
that
event
the
letter
of
credit
is
not
accessible
as
an
insured
deposit,
the
inescapable
conclusion
being
only
this,
what
the
statute
says,
that
if
the
agreement
is
a
promissory
note,
then
the
letter
of
credit
is
insured
and
is
assessed.
i
note
also,
justice
o'connor,
in
further
response
to
your
question,
that
the
distinction
between
funded
and
unfunded
letters
of
credit
has
been
drawn
by
the
fdic
in
other
contexts
where
at
least
prior
to
this
litigation
it
was
considered
important.
i
refer
to
the
lending
limits
regulations
that
were
promulgated
and
also
those
dealing
with
financial
statement
disclosure.
it
does
not
appear
interestingly,
and
in
respondent's
view
very
tellingly,
however,
in
the
very
regulations
that
the
fdic
promulgated
entitled
clarification
and
definition
of
deposit
insurance
coverage.
this
is
12
cfr
part
320.
any
distinction
between
funded
and
unfunded
letters
of
credit
that
would
be
important
for
the
purposes
of
deposit
insurance
certainly
would
have
been
mentioned
in
the
very
regulations
that
were
issued
to
define
and
clarify
deposit
insurance
coverage,
yet
no
distinction
is
made
there.
likewise,
12
cfr
part
327,
dealing
with--
mr.
gerald
f.
slattery,
jr.
--that
is...
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
gerald
f.
slattery,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
in
more
than
merely
in
the
regulations
dealing
with
the
clarification
and
definition
of
deposit
insurance--
mr.
gerald
f.
slattery,
jr.
--your
honor
asked
counsel
for
the
fdic
if
it
could
not
be
considered
funded
by
having
been
issued
in
exchange
for
the
promissory
note.
in
our
view,
congress
defined
money
or
its
equivalent
as
being
a
letter
of
credit
issued
in
exchange
for
just
such
a
promissory
note.
so,
in
answer
to
your
question,
it
can
be
considered--
mr.
gerald
f.
slattery,
jr.
--i
would
not
say
it
would
be
insured
in
that
event,
your
honor.
we
have
here--
mr.
gerald
f.
slattery,
jr.
--yes,
i
am,
your
honor.
and
that
is
because
the
statute
unequivocally
defines
money
or
its
equivalent
not
in
the
limited
sense
that
the
fdic
has
defined
it
here
today,
but
congress
has
made
the
task
easy.
mr.
gerald
f.
slattery,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
f.
slattery,
jr.
i
disagree
with
that
position
advanced
by
the
fdic.
your
honor
has
correctly
characterized
it,
but
it
is
incorrect
as
a
matter
of
law.
the
sources
cited
as
support
by
the
fdic
for
that
statement
were
a
treasury
regulation
dealing
with
the
status
of
notes
that
are
eligible
for
discount
at
federal
reserve
banks
and
also
a
tax
decision
that
addressed
a
promissory
note
given
by
a
man
to
his
wife
and
children
for
no
consideration,
and
the
issue
in
that
case
was
the
deductibility
of
interest
on
that
note.
those
cases
hardly
stand
for
the
proposition
that
orion's
note
was
not
a
note,
and
that
really
is
the
question
the
fdic
is
trying
to
raise,
when
is
a
note
not
a
note.
it
may
look
like
a
note
and
say
it
is
a
note
and
bear
all
of
the
customary
hallmarks
of
a
note,
but
it
is
not.
further
in
regard
to
that
question
the
fdic
has
stated
that
it
is
a
matter
of
federal
law
in
its
reply
brief,
and
has
cited
the
court
to,
i
believe,
two
federal
cases.
it
is
important
to
remember,
however,
that
if
you
look
at
those
cases,
what
do
those
cases
say
about
what
federal
common
law
is?
where
do
they
tell
us
to
go?
mr.
gerald
f.
slattery,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
the
federal
law
is
that
the
ordinary
common
meaning
of
promissory
note
is
what
was
meant
to
apply,
and
the
state
court
cases
that
deal
with
the
definition
of
promissory
note
are
not
irrelevant.
to
the
contrary,
federal
law,
federal
common
law
directs
us
to
look
to
those
analogous
state
cases
to
find
out
what
a
note
is.
mr.
gerald
f.
slattery,
jr.
there
is
no
denying
that,
your
honor.
you
are
correct.
mr.
gerald
f.
slattery,
jr.
that
is
a
good
question,
justice
stevens,
and
it
raises
the
fact
pattern,
incidentally,
that
is
before
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
allen
versus
fdic.
it
is
still
a
note.
conditions
on
the
face
of
a
promissory
note
do
not
render
it
not
a
promissory
note.
mr.
gerald
f.
slattery,
jr.
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
i
believe
it
is
a
deposit
simply
because
congress
said
that
it
is.
congress
only
asks
us
to
look
whether
the
instrument
that
the
bank
has
issued
is
a
letter
of
credit,
and
to
look
whether
the
instrument
it
has
received
is
a
promissory
note.
it
was
not
an
unreasonable
decision
by
congress
to
have
made.
mr.
gerald
f.
slattery,
jr.
i
don't
believe...
perhaps--
mr.
gerald
f.
slattery,
jr.
--that
is
true
as
a
conceptual
matter,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
f.
slattery,
jr.
the
difference
is
very
important,
your
honor.
promissory
notes
generally,
as
congress
looked
at
the
question
in
1960,
can
have
provisions
that
reimbursement
agreements
or
the
mere
statutory
obligation
to
reimburse
do
not
encompass.
example,
specific
provisions
related
to
the
timing
of
repayment
of
principle
and
interest.
the
remedies
of
a
lender--
mr.
gerald
f.
slattery,
jr.
--yes
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
f.
slattery,
jr.
i
have
the
note
reproduced
in
the
joint
appendix
at
pages
27
and
30,
and
there
are
specific
remedies
the
specifics
of
which
i
cannot
recall
at
this
time,
but
which
go
far
beyond
the
mere
statutory
obligation
of
orion
to
reimburse.
these
are
remedies
relating
to
the
repayment
of
principle
and
interest,
rights
of
the
lender
upon
default,
and
other
matters
that
are
not
covered
in
the
statutory
obligation
to
reimburse.
in
that
connection,
it
is
important--
mr.
gerald
f.
slattery,
jr.
--no,
your
honor,
that
is
not
correct.
my
position
is
that
my
client,
philadelphia
gear,
is
the
depositor
because
it
holds
the
credit
instrument
that
the
bank
has
issued,
its
letter
of
credit.
mr.
gerald
f.
slattery,
jr.
no,
i
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
f.
slattery,
jr.
your
honor,
i
believe
that
question
in
a
sense
presupposes
the
rather
narrow
view
of
deposit
that
the
fdic
has
articulated
here
today.
congress...
and
that
is
the
failing
of
the
fdic's
conceptual
argument.
when
people
who
are
not
familiar
with
the
federal
deposit
insurance
act
think
of
the
term
deposit,
they
think
of
it
in
the
sense
that
the
fdic
has
presented
it
here
today,
the
garden
variety
savings
account
and
checking
account,
the
concept
of
a
physical
thing
or
a
physical
object
left
in
the
custody
of
the
bank
almost.
in
actuality,
a
deposit
is
nothing
more
than
a
liability,
an
obligation,
and
congress
decided
that
certain
persons
who
theretofore,
before
the
federal
deposit
insurance
act,
had
not
been
recognized
as
depositors
in
the
traditional
sense,
would
now
be
treated
as
depositors,
it
expanded
the
class.
a
good
example
is
in
section
1813(l)(4),
which
gives
insured
depositor
status
to
many
persons
who
have
not
entrusted
anything
of
value
to
the
bank.
example.
a
check
that
the
bank
writes
to
pay
its
water
bill
or
its
light
bill
may
be
an
insured
deposit.
a
check
that
it
writes
to
an
attorney
for
a
retainer
or
to
its
landlord
for
rent,
these
are
examples
of
credit
instruments
that
the
bank
has
issued
where
the
person
who
is
the
owner
of
the
deposit
obligation
has
not
entrusted
anything
of
value
to
the
bank,
yet
the
act
clearly
recognizes
the
holders
of
those
instruments
as
insured
depositors.
it
does
so
because
its
purpose
was
far
broader
than
the
narrow
purpose
the
fdic
has
tried
to
paint
here
today.
it
was
not
merely
to
prevent
runs
on
banks
or
to
protect
the
hard
earnings
that
chief
justice
burger
referred
to
in
a
question.
it
was
to
ensure
that
persons
holding
certain
credit
instruments
of
a
bank
in
the
circumstances
outlined
in
the
statute
would
be
brought
within
the
ambit
of
congress's
new
expanded
definition
of
deposit.
respondent
philadelphia
gear
was
just
such
one
of
those
persons.
mr.
gerald
f.
slattery,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
f.
slattery,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
f.
slattery,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
f.
slattery,
jr.
i
think
that
the
enforceability
of
the
note
should
not
be
confused
with
the
question
of--
mr.
gerald
f.
slattery,
jr.
--exactly.
orion
from
the
moment--
mr.
gerald
f.
slattery,
jr.
--it
created
the
obligation
on
orion's
part
to
reimburse
the
bank
for
any
drafts
that
were
paid
on
the
letter
of
credit.
that
was
an
obligation
that
was
in
existence
from
the
moment
orion
executed
the
note.
mr.
gerald
f.
slattery,
jr.
orion
was
the
only
one
that
was
liable
on
the
note.
that
is
correct,
justice
white.
mr.
gerald
f.
slattery,
jr.
i
think
an
example
may
help
to
answer
that
question,
your
honor.
banks
routinely
when
involved
in
interim
financing
will
enter
into
a
loan
agreement
and
in
connection
with
the
loan
agreement
the
customer
will
sign
a
promissory
note
that
would
obligate
it
to
pay
such
amounts
as
the
advances
from
time
to
time
as
the
builder
borrower
draws
down,
so
to
speak.
one
couldn't
claim
that
the
builder
in
that
circumstance
were
not
liable
on
the
note
even
before
the
bank
had
extended
funds.
the
builder
is
liable
in
the
sense
that
he
must
hold
himself
ready
to
perform
at
the
time
that
his
performance
is
due,
and
that
is
what
the
word
liable
means.
must
perform
when
performance
is
due.
not
the
narrow
limited
sense
of
a
presently
existing
debt
on
which
interest
is
running.
liability
in
my
view
as
congress
used
the
term
means
that
one
must
hold
oneself
in
a
position
ready
to
perform
in
accordance
with
the
document
that
one
has
signed.
mr.
gerald
f.
slattery,
jr.
it
might
very
well
be,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
f.
slattery,
jr.
possibly,
and
that
raises
the
very
good
point
that
congress
drew
some
bright
lines
where
it
in
effect
wrote
this
insurance
policy
in
1960,
and
that,
i
believe,
is
the
reason
for
some
of
the...
what
appear
at
first
blush
to
be
anomalies
in
the
statute
right
now.
congress
knew
in
1960
that
when
it
was
drafting
this
insurance
policy
it
had
to
clearly
delineate
between
the
insurance
risks
that
were
covered
and
those
that
were
not
covered.
it
chose
to
hold
without
equivocation
that
letters
of
credit
issued
in
exchange
for
promissory
notes
were
insured
deposits.
mr.
gerald
f.
slattery,
jr.
i
would
say
they
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
f.
slattery,
jr.
no,
it
did
not,
your
honor.
it
relied
on
the
creditworthiness
of
the
bank
and
on
the
liability
of
the
bank
to
pay
on
its
letter
of
credit.
it
did
not
rely
on
the
existence
or
nonexistence
of
deposit
insurance.
at
least
there
is
no
support
in
the
record
as
i
read
it
for
that
reading.
i
do
not
think
reliance
is
important
under
the
statutory
scheme,
for
example,
because
as
a
matter
of
practice
the
holder
of
the
letter
of
credit
very
rarely,
if
at
all,
will
be
privy
to
the
negotiations
between
the
issuing
bank
and
its
own
customer.
an
example
is,
even
if
a
letter
of
credit
were
fully
funded
as
the
fdic
has
acknowledged...
pardon
me.
even
if
a
letter
of
credit
were
funded
in
the
sense
that
the
fdic
uses
the
term,
the
fdic
would
acknowledge
that
that
letter
of
credit
is
an
insured
deposit
and
the
beneficiary
of
that
letter
of
credit
would
have
no
more
idea
whether
it
was
funded
or
not
than
philadelphia
gear
in
this
case
had
whether
orion
had
submitted
a
promissory
note
or
not.
the
question
of
reliance
appears
to
be
irrelevant
under
the
statutory
scheme,
and
even
under
the
fdic's
own
theory
of
the
case.
mr.
gerald
f.
slattery,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not.
mr.
gerald
f.
slattery,
jr.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record.
there
is
some
evidence
in
the
regulations
and
in
the
legislative
history
which
indicates
either
that
the
fdic
has
simply
not
considered
the
question
before
or
that
where
it
has
spoken
on
the
issue
it
has
failed
to
draw
this
fundamental
distinction
between
funded
and
unfunded
letters
of
credit
in
the
context
of
deposit
insurance
with
which
we
are
concerned
today,
but
has
drawn
it
in
other
contexts,
which
suggests
that
if
the
distinction
were
important
here,
it
would
have
been
expressed
here
as
well.
mr.
gerald
f.
slattery,
jr.
that
is
true,
your
honor.
and
it
raises
a
very
interesting
point.
the
fdic
concedes
that
an
unconditional,
as
it
uses
the
term,
promissory
note
does
give
rise
to
an
insured
deposit
obligation,
yet
in
its
reply
brief
in
support
of
its
petition
for
certiorari
it
made
what
to
respondent
appears
to
be
the
rather
startling
admission
that
it
doesn't
maintain
the
records
it
needs
to
determine
whether
even
those
letters
of
credit
that
it
acknowledges
are
insured
deposits
are
being
assessed.
it
is
stated
on
page
4,
in
footnote
number
3
of
its
reply
brief,
that
it
maintains
no
records
of
the
amount
of
standby
letters
of
credit
that
are
backed
by
promissory
notes.
this
is
especially
telling,
i
think,
in
view
of
the
importance
that
the
statute
itself
places
on
promissory
notes,
and
also
in
view
of
the
importance
that
the
fdic
has
placed
in
its
brief
on
even
some
promissory
notes.
so,
that
again
is
another
indication
in
respondent's
view
of
the
fdic's
failure
to
consider.
it
is
problematic
whether
the
fdic
has
considered
it
or
not,
and
the
regulatory
and
the
legislative
history
points
either
to
a
conclusion
that
it
has
not
been
considered
or
to
a
conclusion...
well,
it
points
to
a
conclusion
that
it
has
not
been
considered
in
the
context
of
deposit
insurance.
mr.
gerald
f.
slattery,
jr.
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
justice
stevens.
i
think
that
a
letter
of
credit
transaction
probably
can
be
structured
in
as
many
different
ways
as
an
ordinary
loan,
for
example,
can
be
structured,
or
the
circumstances
under
which
a
cashier's
check
might
be
issued.
the
statute
tells
us
in
what
circumstances
the
holders
of
these
credit
instruments
are
insured
depositors
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
and
under
what
circumstances
they
are
not.
mr.
gerald
f.
slattery,
jr.
i
would
note
in
response
to
that
question,
your
honor,
that
the
bank
officer
who
executed
this
letter
of
credit
refused
to
testify
at
trial,
citing
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
i
think
that
is
definitely
true,
your
honor.
the
amount
of
deference
that
the
fdic's
interpretation
is
due
in
this
case
depends,
of
course,
upon
the
familiar
principles
that
the
court
enunciated
in
the
skidmore
versus
swift
and
company
case.
these
are
the
validity
of
its
reasoning,
the
thoroughness
of
its
consideration,
and
the
consistency
with
its
earlier
and
later
pronouncements
on
the
issue.
i
believe
that
the
reasoning
that
the
fdic
has
advanced
is
patently
invalid.
it
flies
in
the
face
of
the
statute.
congress...
the
fdic,
of
course,
today
is
attempting
to
limit
or
to
narrow
the
class
of
persons
that
the
deposit
insurance
program
clearly
protects.
this
attempt
to
narrow
the
statutory
language
flies
in
the
face
of
section
1813(l)(5)
in
which
congress,
specifically
focusing
upon
the
authority
granted
to
the
fdic
in
the
area
of
defining
deposit
insurance
coverage,
gave
the
fdic
only
the
power
to
expand
the
scope
of
deposit
insurance
coverage.
nowhere
in
the
statute
is
there
any
authority
for
the
fdic
to
narrow
the
coverage
clearly
afforded
by
the
statute,
least
of
all
under
section
1819
10th,
which
merely
gives
it
rulemaking
power
to
carry
out
congressionally
expressed
intent.
moreover,
the
fdic's
position
in
this
case
has
been
positively
contradicted.
this
isn't
just
a
case
of
the
fdic
assuming
sub
silencio,
as
it
were,
that
unfunded
letters
of
credit
are
not
insured
deposits.
their
distinction
in
two
other
contexts
between
funded
and
unfunded
letters
of
credit,
lending
limits,
and
financial
statement
disclosure,
while
not
making
the
distinction
in
the
context
of
deposit
insurance,
suggests
that
there
is
no
room
for
that
arbitrary
unwarranted
gloss
on
the
clear
statutory
language
in
this
case.
the
consistency
of
the
fdic's
position
with
its
earlier
and
later
pronouncements
on
the
issue
must,
of
course,
also
be
examined
as
the
court
determines
the
amount
of
deference
to
which
the
fdic's
interpretation
is
due.
in
this
regard,
it
is
perhaps
true
that
assessment
decision
number
109
promulgated
by
the
fdic
in
1956
has
an
importance
that
cannot
be
overemphasized.
that
assessment
decision
states
plainly,
and
it
is
set
out
in
our
brief,
that
if...
that
commercial
letters
of
credit,
letters
of
credit
used
in
commerce,
normally
are
not
sold
for
cash,
but
are
issued
against
an
agreement
to
reimburse
the
bank
for
drafts
paid.
the
fdic
goes
on
to
say
therein
that
if
the
reimbursement
agreement
is
not
a
promissory
note,
then
in
that
event
the
letter
of
credit
is
not
assessable,
the
clear
unescapable
implication
being
that
if
the
reimbursement
agreement
is
a
promissory
note
as
orion
gave
penn
square
bank
in
this
case,
the
letter
of
credit
is
insured
and
is
assessable.
i
was
struck
listening
to...
reading
the
fdic's
briefs
and
listening
to
the
fdic's
arguments
this
morning
by
the
similarity
between
the
fdic's
arguments
in
this
case
and
the
arguments
that
the
federal
reserve
board
presented
in
the
dimension
financial
corporation
case
which
the
court
decided
just
this
past
january.
as
the
court
will
recall,
the
issue
faced
by
the
court
in
that
case
was
whether
the
federal
reserve
board
in
its
attempts
to
expand
its
regulatory
authority
over
non-bank
banks
could
put
an
unwarranted
gloss
on
the
statutory
term
demand
deposits
in
the
bank
holding
company
act.
where
the
court
rejected
this
attempt
by
the
federal
reserve
board
to
usurp
the
authority
of
congress
so
should
it
reject
the
fdic's
similar
attempt
in
this
case.
respondent's
position
begins
and
ends
where
the
statute
begins
and
ends.
where
the
statute
says
letter
of
credit,
the
fdic
says
funded
letter
of
credit.
where
the
statute
says
promissory
note,
the
fdic
says
uncontingent
promissory
note.
or
note
that
in
a
meaningful
economic
sense
is
the
equivalent
of
money.
the
unadorned
language
of
the
statute
is
free
of
the
equivocations
that
have
been
proffered
by
the
fdic
throughout
the
history
of
this
case
in
different
ways.
the
respondent
submits
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
firmly
rooted,
as
it
was,
in
the
plain
statutory
language,
was
correct
and
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
