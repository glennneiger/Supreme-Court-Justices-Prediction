justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
on
that
point,
general
hoornstra,
does
the
wisconsin
legislature
define
any
other
groups
of
ineligible
suppliers
other
than
this
one?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
a
similar
pattern,
if
they've
been
found
guilty
on
three
separate
occasions
or
something
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
violating
something
like
the
ricoh
statute
or,
committed
a
lot
of
arsons
or
something
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no
other
statutory
category
of
ineligible
suppliers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
really
a
fair
characterization,
a
choice
between...
you
have
a
flat
rule
that
even
if
there's
only
one
supplier,
you
just
can't
buy
the
goods,
independent
of
if
there
are
a
hundred,
you
can
still
just...
it
isn't
choosing
between
two,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
legislative
prohibition,
it's
not
an
individual
decision
by
a
purchasing
agent.
or,
do
i
misunderstand?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
hoornstra,
you
surely
don't
contend
the
state
can
have
the
same
latitude
as
a
private
purchaser
in
all
its
decisions
on
purchasing,
do
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
they
could
say,
we
won't
purchase
from
baptists--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what
if
they
said,
we
won't
purchase
from
any
out
of
state
companies?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
about
even
under
the
commerce
clause,
for
any
companies
that
are
engaged
in
interstate
commerce--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--they
don't
really
have
the
same
freedom
as
a
private
purchaser?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
interrupt
you
again.
supposing
wisconsin
had
a
statute
and
said,
no
private
company
in
wisconsin
may
buy
from
a
labor
law
violator.
and
there's
no
objection
to
that,
i
suppose,
except
possibly
pre-emption.
he's
been
arguing
the
market
participant
at
great
length,
but
what...
would
you
concede
there
would
be
pre-emption
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
be
a
pre-emption
problems,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
be
a
pre-emption
problem?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
there
is
pre-emption
of
that,
why
isn't
there
also
pre-emption
where
you're
the
purchaser?
why
is
the
state
entitled
to
different
treatment
than
the
private
purchaser?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
pre-emption?
i
understand
that's
a
difference,
but
why
is
that
difference
related
to
the
pre-emption
issue,
because
you're
asking,
what
did
congress
intend.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask,
since
you
paused,
you
started
to
tell
us
what
the
purpose
for
the
statute
was
in
the
court
of
appeals.
have
you
told
us?
if
you
have,
i'm
not
sure
i--
