mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
begin
by
directing
my
remarks
to
the
questions
posed
by
justice
o'connor
concerning
the
purpose
of
the
state's
enactment.
in
the
briefs
before
this
court,
i
think
the
state
has
been
somewhat
less
than
clear
with
respect
to
what
its
purpose
was
in
enacting
the
labor
law
violator
debarment
statutes
in
wisconsin.
below,
however,
the
state
was
quite
clear
with
respect
to
what
its
purpose
is
and
i
would
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
record
in
this
case.
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi,
jr.
in
the
final
analysis,
justice
rehnquist,
i
agree
with
you
that
the
purpose
of
the
state
is
irrelevant
if
the
effect
is
to
interfere
with
the
federal
statutory
scheme.
i
believe,
however,
that
the
purpose
of
the
state
is
of
some
interest
in
determining
whether
or
not
there
is
any
legitimate
state
interest
in
an
area
of
deeply
rooted
local
concern
which
is
of
some
consequence
under
the
pre-emption
doctrine
where
the
federal
interest
is
only
of
peripheral
concern.
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi,
jr.
insofar
as
that
is
a
statement
of
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
no,
i
do
not...
in
the
final
analysis
i
agree
with
you
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
the
object
of
the
statute,
is
irrelevant.
it
is
the
effect
of
the
statute
and
its
potential
for
interfering
with
the
federal
statutory
scheme
that
is
of,
in
the
final
analysis,
of
utmost
importance
under
the
supremacy
clause.
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi,
jr.
i
believe
it
depends
upon
the
object
of
the
decision
not
to
purchase.
where
the
state
addresses--
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi,
jr.
--it
makes
a
difference
only
in
those
cases
in
which
the
interference
is
of
a
peripheral
nature.
i
don't
think
in
this
case,
regardless
of
what
the
purpose
of
the
state
would
be,
interference
with
the
federal
right
of
appeal
which
is
one
of
the
areas
that
we
have
addressed
is
so
clear,
so
strong
that
regardless
of
what
the
state's
actions
would
be
in
this
case,
i
feel
pre-emption
is
appropriate.
but
in
the
cases
you
have
posited,
which
is
a
hypothetical
case
that
has
very
little
to
do
with
this
particular
statute,
were
it
not
for
the
interference
with
the
right
of
appeal,
one
could
at
least
posit
a
legitimate
state
interest,
legitimate
state
economic
interest
in
the
propensity
towards
participation
in
labor
disputes.
here,
of
course,
the
state
statute
does
not
even
permit
such
a
classification.
in
this
case
wisconsin
statute
does
not
on
its
face,
or
through
any
statement
of
purpose
that
we've
heard
so
far,
does
not
limit
itself
to
situations
in
which
an
employer
engages
in
a
labor
dispute
where
the
labor
dispute
could
be
perceived
by
the
state
as
interfering
with
the
performance
of
the
state
contract.
the
wisconsin
labor
law
debarment
statutes
do
not
even
address
only
labor
disputes
which
result
or
could
be
perceived
as
resulting
in
an
unreliable
contractor
because
he
has
a
history
of
labor
disputes.
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi,
jr.
because,
your
honor,
the
winconsin
statute
addresses
labor
law
violations,
violation
of
federal
law,
qua
violation
of
federal
law.
it
does
not
at
all
address
nor
does
it
purport
to
address
the
underlying
labor
disputes
that
may
have
given
rise
to
unfair
labor
practices.
it
makes
no
judgment
with
respect
to
whether
those
were
the
types
of
labor
disputes
that
would...
upon
which
the
state
could
base
a
judgment
that
the
contractor
was
unreliable,
had
a
history
of
unreliability.
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi,
jr.
i
think
it
has
to
be
that
precise
because
there
is
a
very
definite
interference
with
the
federal
statutory
scheme.
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
it
interferes
with
the
federal
right
of
appeal
because
this
statute
does
not
debar
individuals
who
are
unfair
labor
practice
violators.
this
statute
debars
unfair
labor
practice
violators
who
have
appealed
to
a
united
states
court
of
appeals
and
has
lost.
there
are
two
ways
in
which
an
employer
can
seek
review
in
the
court
of
appeals.
one
is
to
directly
appeal.
the
other
approach
is
to
allow
the...
is
to
decline
to
obey
the
board's
order
which
is
not
self-effectuated,
and
to
allow
the
board
to
proceed
for
enforcement
before
a
court
of
appeals.
the
only
difference
in
those
two
types
of
cases,
of
course,
is
that
the
board
in
that
case
gets
to
choose
the
forum
whereas
in
the
former
case
the
employer
does.
in
both
cases,
i
submit,
that
is
the
exercise
of
a
right
of
appeal
by
the
employer.
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi,
jr.
no,
it
penalizes
the
employer
in
both
cases,
your
honor.
if
there
is
a
subsequent
adverse
decision
from
a
court
of
appeals,
that
is
the
only
circumstance
under
which
wisconsin
will
debar.
so,
the
classification
that
wisconsin
sets
up
is
not
that,
we
are
not
going
to
deal
with
unfair
labor
practice
law
violators,
we
are
not...
the
classification
they
do
set
up
is,
we
are
not
going
to
deal
with
unfair
labor
practice
violators,
violators
of
federal
law,
who
have
appealed
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
and
who
have
lost.
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi,
jr.
at
the
time
at
which
the
employer
must
decide
whether
to
seek
review
before
the
united
states
court
of
appeals,
either
directly
by
filing
his
appeal
himself
or
indirectly
by
allowing...
by
refusing
to
obey
the
board
order
and
allow
the
board
to
appeal
the
case
to
the
court
of
appeals,
a
chilling
effect
sets
in
because
the
employer
knows
that
if
he
does
that
and
loses
then
he
will
be
debarred
by
state
contract,
from
state
contracts.
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi,
jr.
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
there
are
two
circumstances
under
which...
i
believe
i
understand
the
point
of
confusion
on
my
part.
there
are
two
circumstances
under
which
the
board
may
seek
review
itself.
one
is
where
the
employer
declines
to
obey
the
board's
order.
in
that
circumstance,
that
is
the
equivalent
of
the
employer
appealing
himself.
the
only
difference
is
that
the
board
gets
to
choose
the
forum.
that's
just
the
same
as
though
the
employer
had
appealed
himself.
the
second
circumstance
under
which
the
board
will
seek
court
enforcement
is
even
more
interesting,
i
think.
in
that
circumstance
there
are
a
limited
number
of
occasions
in
which
the
general
counsel
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
will
seek
enforcement
of
a
board
order,
even
when
the
employer
is
prepared
to
comply
with
that
order.
now,
if
the
general
counsel
knows,
if
the
general
counsel
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
knows
that
there
are
statutes
like
the
wisconsin
statute,
as
they
are
in
fact
in
wisconsin,
michigan
and
a
number
of
other
states,
knows
that
if
he
seeks
a
court
of
appeals
decision,
forcing
the
court
order,
that
he
can
trigger
one
of
the
statutes.
it
gives
him
the
power
of
debarment,
a
power
that
was
expressly
denied
to
him
by
congress.
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi,
jr.
no,
it
isn't,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
there
are
two
grounds
for
pre-emption.
one
is
that
it
interferes
with
the
federal
right
of
appeal
as
set
forth
in
section
7
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
our
second
basis
for
pre-emption
is
the
fact
that
it
imposes
a
penalty.
those
are
two
independent
bases
on
which
we
seek
to
have
the
statute
pre-empted.
we
seek
affirmance
of
the
seventh
circuit's
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi,
jr.
i
wanted
to
underscore
the
statements
of
purpose
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
below,
which
i
think
have
not
been
really
set
forth
in
the
briefs
before
this
court.
just
a
couple
of
examples,
is
the
from
the
very
beginning,
defendants's
brief
in
opposition
to
the
motion
for
preliminary
relief,
which
appears
in
the
record
at
r-8,
page
15,
wisconsin
said
that
the
wisconsin
statutes
simply
encourage
obedience
to
law
as
federally
adjudicated.
likewise,
the
defendant's
brief
in
support
of
its
motion
for
summary
judgment
which
appears
at
r-22
states
that:
"the
state
has
a
deeply
rooted
policy
of
discouraging
labor
law
violations,
and
the
state,
as
a
market
participator
in
the
purchase
of
the
goods
and
products,
can
so
restrict
its
purchases
so
as
not
to
promote
labor
law
violators
as
an
exception
to
the
national
labor
relations
act
pre-emption.
"
again,
18
of
this
document...
"it
will
not
make
purchases
from
flagrant
labor
law
violators
in
promotion
of
its
legitimate
stated
interest
of
dealing
only
with
companies
in
compliance
with
federal
rulings.
"
"wisconsin
is
not
engaging
in
state
regulation
of
private
labor
conduct
but
is
merely
seeking
to
influence
private
conduct
already
prescribed
by
federal
labor
policy.
"
the
underscoring
of
"influence
private
conduct"
is
wisconsin's.
and
finally,
"wisconsin
has
a
long
history
of
fostering
labor
relations
consistent
with
the
goals
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
and
if
in
its
wisdom
the
legislature
determined
that
the
state
should
not
make
purchases
from
frequent
labor
law
violators,
that
is
the
state's
prerogative.
"
most
telling
was
the
brief
in
opposition
to
the
plaintiff's
notion
for
summary
judgment
which
appears
at
r-24.
at
page
16
of
that
document
wisconsin
said,
explaining
why
it
was
not
bound
by
what
the
congress
had
done
in
rejecting
penalties
under
the
statute,
it
said:
"whether
wisconsin
was
wise
in
its
policy
of
enacting
state
debarment
procedures
for
its
contracts
is
not
relevant
here.
"
the
fact
is
that
its
views
are
different
from
congress's
on
this
matter.
i
think
it's
obvious,
therefore,
that
the
purpose
of
this
statute
is
not
merely
the
state
declining
to
do
business.
it
has
to
be
recognized
that
the
purpose
of
that
declining
to
do
business
is
not
some
legitimate
state
economic
interest
but
merely
to
seek
enforcement
of
federal
law.
this
is
also
clear
from
the
statute
itself,
again
addressing
myself
to
justice
o'connor's
questions
and
points.
this
statute
is
not
limited
to
current
labor
disputes
between
an
employer
and
a
union
where
the
state
makes
the
judgment
that
this
labor
dispute
will
interfere
with
the
performance
of
the
contract.
thus,
the
state
in
that
type
of
situation
could
make
the
judgment
that
the
labor
dispute
might
affect
performance
and
therefore
the
state
would
have
a
legitimate
economic
interest
in
the
statute...
in
the
labor
dispute
which
may
underpin
the
statutory
violation.
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi,
jr.
i
do
not
believe
that
it
could
be
made
a
state
policy.
i
think
there
is
a
world
of
difference
between
the
situation
that
mr.
hoornstra
posits,
where
because
of
a
particular
labor
dispute
between
a
union
and
an
employer,
the
union
members
have
a
free
speech
right
to
appeal
to
the
state,
to
cease
doing
business
with
the
employer.
that
is
a
far
cry
from
enacting
a
statute
which
prohibits
doing
business
with
a
particular
classification
of
employer.
i
suggest
that
that
is
more
like
section
8-e
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
which
prohibits
private
traders
from
entering
into
agreements
with
the
union,
to
cease
doing
business
with
some
third
party.
that
situation
is
very
much
akin,
i
think,
to
the
passage
of
a
statute
which
prohibits
the
dealing
with
a
particular
classification
of
employers.
and
what
does
the
state
tell
us
when
we
mention
section
8-e
under
the
national
labor
relations
act?
it
says,
"we
are
a
state.
"
"we
are
exempt
from
the
national
labor
relations
act.
"
the
state
is
trying
to
have
its
cake
and
eat
it
too.
on
the
one
hand
it
says
it
is
a
private
trader
and
on
the
other
hand
it
hides
behind
the
fact
that
it
is
a
state
and
therefore
exempt
from
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi,
jr.
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
pre-emptive...
precedents
on
pre-emption
of
ricoh.
i
only--
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi,
jr.
--i
don't
think
there
are.
it
depends
on
whether
or
not
the
ricoh
legislative
scheme
was
supposed
to
provide
an
exclusive
remedy,
an
exclusive
federal
regulation
of
the
types
of
violations
that
constitute
a
violation
of
ricoh.
the
national
labor
relations
act
is
different.
let's
assume
that
ricoh...
strike
that.
the
national
labor
relations
act
is
an
extensive
and
complex,
integrated
regulatory
scheme
established
by
the
federal
government
in
which
the
federal
government
decided
to
occupy
the
field,
this
court
has
held
time
and
again,
in
order
to
avoid
these
local
attitudes
and
local
approaches
to
labor
problems
and
labor
disputes.
therefore,
the
states
have
repeatedly
been
held
not
to
have
a
right
to
interfere
with
the
federal
statutory
scheme.
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi,
jr.
i
believe
this
court
has
made
it
quite
clear
under,
first
of
all
mcculloch
with
respect
to
pre-emption
generally,
mcculloch
versus
maryland,
and
garment
under
the
labor
law
pre-emption.
i
believe
this
court
has
made
it
quite
clear
that
the
method
or
the
mode
adopted
is
of
absolutely
no
relevance
as
to
whether
or
not
there
should
be
pre-emption
because
the
issue
is
not
whether
the
state
uses
a
particular
method
or
mode.
the
question
is
whether
that
method
or
mode,
regardless
of
what
it
is,
interferes
with
the
statutory
scheme
established
by
the
federal
government.
in
garment,
for
example,
the
court
in
that
case
was
presented
with
a
situation
in
which
the
state
of
california
merely
sought
to
provide
civil
damage
remedy
for
illegal
picketing,
that
which
was
admittedly
illegal
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi,
jr.
all
right.
i
believe
that
there
is
no
difference,
however,
your
honor,
between
what
the
state
would
like
to
call
participation
in
the
market
and
regulation
in
the
final
analysis.
let
us
address
the
market
participant
exception
because
i
think
it
becomes
clear
from
that.
when
a
state
is
the
market
participant
exception
to
the
dormant
commerce
clause
is
premised
upon
the
concept
that
the
state,
acting
in
its
own
economic
self-interest,
can
use
its
treasury
for
the
benefit
of
its
own
citizens.
that
is
the
one
theme
that
is
consistent
in
every
market
participant
exception
case.
in
fact,
the
legitimate
state
interest
to
be
served
by
the
exercise
of
the
spending
power
in
those
cases
is
favoritism.
but
once
you
take
the
market
participant
exception
and
its
limited
recognition
of
the
fact
that
within
the
dormant
commerce
clause
there
is
a
difference
between
direct
regulation
and
indirect
action,
once
you
take
the
market
participant
concept
outside
the
dormant
commerce
clause,
you
lose
completely
the
legitimate
state
interest
that
underpins
the
market
participant
exception
of
acting
in
one's
own
legitimate
economic
self-interest,
spending
for
the
benefit
of
one's
citizens
who
fund
that
treasury.
outside
of
the
dormant
commerce
clause,
that
rationale
ceases
to
exist
and
the
market
participant
exception
becomes
an
unrestricted
principle.
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi,
jr.
if
the
object
of
the
statute,
it
seems
to
me,
were
directed
at
the
labor
dispute
and
not
at
an
unfair
labor
practice
qua
unfair
labor
practice--
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi,
jr.
--i
think
that
presents
a
far
closer
case
than
the
case
at
bar,
because
at
least
in
that
case
the
state
could
argue
that
it
has
a
legitimate
economic
self-interest
in
not
dealing
with
an
employer
that
has
a
lot
of
labor
disputes
because
it's
concluded,
it's
determined,
that
individual
is
an
unreliable
contractor--
but
it's
important
to
note,
your
honor,
that
in
this
case
this
statute
makes
no
such
classification,
provides
and
permits
of
no
such
distinction
or
judgment.
indeed,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
very
fact
that
this
statute
did
not
provide
for
any
administrative
determinations
of
that
type
only
underscored
the
penal
nature
of
the
statute,
and
by
penal
i
mean
debarring
an
employer
for
a
violation
of
law,
not
because
of
any
economic
consequences
to
the
state
or
within
the
state,
but
simply
because
there
was
a
violation
of
federal
law.
the
instant
case
provides
an
excellent
example
of
what
i
mean.
gould
did
not
commit
any
unfair
labor
practice
in
connection
with
the
performance
of
any
state
contract.
gould
did
not
engage
in
any
labor
dispute
that
was
connected
to
or
related
to
any
contract
with
the
state
of
wisconsin.
gould
did
not
have
a
history
of,
or
the
divisions
with
which
the
state
of
wisconsin
was
dealing,
did
not
have
a
history
of
labor
disputes
which
would
affect
or
might
be
deemed
to
affect
the
ability
of
gould
to
perform
its
contract.
in
fact,
the
divisions
with
which
the
state
of
wisconsin
was
doing
business
were
not
even
those
that
were
found
to
be
guilty
of
the
unfair
labor
practices
which
resulted
in
gould's
debarment.
indeed,
the
divisions
which
gould...
of
gould
which
committed
the
unfair
labor
practices
were
divested
by
gould
prior
to
the
time
of
the
debarment,
although
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
was
the
reason
for
that.
and,
all
of
the
unfair
labor
practices
which
resulted
in
gould's
debarment
had
been
remedied
with
the
exception
of
one,
by
the
time
of
the
passage
of
the
law
and
that
one
was
remedied
prior
to
any
debarment
of
gould
under
the
statute.
there
was,
in
fact,
no
labor
dispute
conduct
that
the
state
could
look
at
and
say,
this
will
affect
the
performance
of
these
contracts
and
therefore
we
have
a
legitimate
self-interest,
economic
self-interest,
in
not
doing
business
with
this
particular
employer.
they
debarred
gould
because
gould
was
an
unfair
labor
practice
violator,
expressly
for
the
reasons
that
they
have
admitted
below.
they
want
to
encourage
compliance
with
the
national
labor
relations
act
by
debarring
those
who
have
engaged
in
violation,
regardless
of
the
nature,
extent,
duration
or
type
of
violation,
without
any
state
economic
interest
to
justify
that
involvement
or
concern
with
the
labor
conduct
of
the
particular
employer.
i
have
already
addressed
the
right
of
appeal
issue.
i
would
like
to
spend
some
time
focusing
on
the
penal
aspect
of
the
statute.
this,
and
lesser
federal
courts,
have
repeatedly
recognized
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
is
remedial
in
nature,
and
that
it
eschews
any
reliance
upon
penalties.
this
court
and
lesser
federal
courts
have
repeatedly
recognized
that
even
the
provision
of
additional
remedies
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
by
states
for
conduct
that
amounts
to
a
violation
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
would
interfere
with
the
federal
statutory
scheme.
in
garner,
in
garmon,
in
lockridge,
in
jones
and
in
farmer,
this
court
has
so
said.
a
fortiori,
if
the
state
imposes
a
penalty
for
violation
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
it
is
definitely
interfering
with
the
federal
statutory
scheme.
affirmance
in
this
case
entails...
which
is
what
we
see...
entails
a
very
narrow
holding.
affirmance
does
not
entail
any
further
incursion
of
state
sovereign
rights
beyond
that
which
has
already
been
declared
to
be
the
limitations
on
sovereignty
dictated
by
the
supremacy
clause
itself.
reversal,
on
the
other
hand,
would
entail
the
creation
of
a
major
new
exception
to
the
supremacy
clause
which
has
never
heretofore
been
recognized
by
this
or
any
other
federal
court.
it
is
no
accident
that
the
state
finds
it
necessary
to
rely
upon
the
market
participant
exception
to
the
dormant
commerce
clause.
make
no
mistake
about
it,
what
the
state
seeks
is
the
creation
of
a
major
exception
to
the
supremacy
clause.
that
is
what
they
have
called
it
before.
that
is
what
reversal
would
require.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
