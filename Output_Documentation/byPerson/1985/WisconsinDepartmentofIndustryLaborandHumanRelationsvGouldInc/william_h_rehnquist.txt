justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
that
may
be
true
under
the
dormant
commerce
clause
and
not
true
where
congress
has
affirmatively
enacted
a
law
such
as
the
nlra,
i
suppose.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
really
think
it
makes
a
lot
of
difference
what
the
purpose
of
the
state
was,
if
we
know
what
the
effect
of
the
statute
is?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
so,
then
it
really
turns
on
what
sort
of
an
argument
the
assistant
attorney
general
for
the
state
of
wisconsin
makes
to
the
seventh
circuit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gangemi,
why
can't
the
state
adopt
something
of
a
prophylactic
rule
for
something
it
considers
a
three-time
loser
in
the
area
of
labor
law
violations?
"if
you've
done
it
this
often,
you're
just
so
likely
to
have
additional
problems
that
we
don't
want
to
deal
with
you.
"
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
does
it
have
to
be
that
precise?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
does
it
interfere
with
the
federal
statute?
you
said
something
about
interfering
with
the
federal
right
of
appeal.
how
does
it
do
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
say
wisconsin
statute
penalizes
the
first
but
not
the
second?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
your
complaint,
then,
that
wisconsin
doesn't
also
include
people
who
have
lost
before
the
nlrb
but
don't
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
your...
what
is
your
complaint
as
to
this
right
of
appeal
business?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
he
either
appeals
himself
or
doesn't
appeal
and
lets
the
board
come
against
him,
in
either
even
he'll
be
debarred,
won't
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
how
does
that
in
any
way
penalize
his
right
to
appeal?
he's
treated
equally
whether
he
appeals
or
doesn't.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
your
right
to
appeal
point
is
different
than
your
pre-emption
point,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gangemi,
what
if
under
justice
stevens'
hypothesis
put
to
general
hoornstra,
the
state
of
wisconsin
has
a
statute
prohibiting
and
contracts
for
supplies
with
any
firms
who
have
been
convicted
of
violating
ricoh.
would
you
say
that
is
pre-empted?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'm
not
sure
there
are
any.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
we've
never
extended
that
to
simply
purchasing
by
a
state
as
opposed
to
regulating,
have
we?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
a
form
of
the
state
regulating
a
labor
activity.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
wisconsin
statute
had
been
framed
in
terms
of
employers
who
three
times
within
the
last
five
years
have
been
subjected
to
strikes
of
more
than
six
months'
duration
and
it
was
limited
to
contractors
who
were
going
to
bid
on
jobs
in
wisconsin?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
don't
care
who
started
the
strike,
we
just
don't
want
to
deal
with
employers
who
have
long
strikes,
with
contractors.
