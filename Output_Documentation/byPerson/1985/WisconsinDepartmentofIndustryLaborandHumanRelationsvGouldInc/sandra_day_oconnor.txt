mr.
hoornstra,
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
statute?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
the
state
ever
concede
during
the
course
of
this
litigation
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
deter
private
conduct,
namely
the
conduct
of
the
respondent
and
companies
like
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
can
the
state
decide
that
it
won't
purchase
from
any
unionized
company
or
employer?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
under
your
view
the
state
would
be
free
to
say,
we
will
not
buy
from
any
employer
whose
employees
belong
to
a
union?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
if
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
deter
private
conduct,
why
doesn't
that
bring
you
in
under
the
pre-emption?
now,
if
the
state's
purpose
were
to
insure
a
steady
supply
from
a
supplier
who
wasn't
involved
in
labor
disputes,
i
could
understand
your
argument.
the
state
would
be
really
concerned
with
its
position
as
a
purchaser.
but,
where
the
state
concedes
that
its
purpose
is
to
regulate
private
activity
and
to
deter
certain
behavior
that
is
regulated
in
detail
by
the
national
labor
relations
act,
why
isn't
that
different?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
spending
seems
to
be
related
to
a
regulatory
purpose
as
opposed
to
a
purpose
devoted
to
assuring
a
certain
source
of
supply.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
mean,
under
the
dormant
commerce
clause
context,
and
maybe
it's
different
if
you're
dealing
with
the
national
labor
relations
act
pre-emption
question.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
except
that
congress
has
set
up
a
very
broad,
detailed
act
in
this
labor
field
in
which
it
has
spelled
out
what
the
penalties
are
and
it
has
structured
the
act
in
such
a
way
that
an
employer
isn't
always
given
an
option
whether
the
employer
is
to
be
a
violator
of
the
act
or
not.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
then,
what
if
the
state
is
concerned
about
having
steady
source
of
supply
of
whatever
the
product
is
that
it's
buying,
and
it
doesn't
want
to
buy
from
somebody
who's
engaged
in
labor
disputes
because
it
thinks
there
are
going
to
be
strikes
and
its
source
of
supply
might
be
cut
off.
do
you
think
the
state
is
not
free
to
say,
i'll
buy
from
"b"
whose
employees
don't
even
belong
to
a
union
as
opposed
to
"a"
who
has
these
problems?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
then
it
does
make
a
difference
what
the
purpose
is,
in
contrast
to
what
you've
just
been
telling
justice
rehnquist?
the
purpose
makes
a
difference,
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
your
view,
could
the
state
adopt
a
policy
of
honoring
every
lawful
union
request
to
boycott
the
products
of
an
employer
whose
employees
are
on
strike,
just
make
that
a
state
policy?
