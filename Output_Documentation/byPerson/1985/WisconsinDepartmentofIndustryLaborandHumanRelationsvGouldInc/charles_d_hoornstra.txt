mr.
charles
d.
hoornstra
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
are
here
on
an
appeal
from
a
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit.
the
decision
struck
as
unconstitutional
two
wisconsin
statutes.
the
ground
of
the
decision
was
pre-emption
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
statutes
in
question
function
together
as
a
single
unit
to
direct
the
purchasing
agent
of
the
state,
when
purchasing
goods
for
the
internal
needs
of
the
state,
not
to
buy
the
goods
of
violators
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
those
nlra
violators
are
defined
by
our
statute
as
those
who
have
been
adjudicated
by
the
federal
courts
three
times
in
a
five
year
period
to
have
violated
the
nlra.
the
consequence
of
being
an
nlra
violator
as
defined
is
that
the
purchasing
agent
may
not
acquire
state
goods
from
those
violators
for
a
three-year
period.
this
directive
aims
only
at
the
state
purchasing
decisions.
it
does
not
direct
itself
to
the
purchasing
decisions
of
counties,
municipalities
or
any
other
political
subdivisions
of
the
state.
mr.
charles
d.
hoornstra
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
your
honor,
is
to
spend
the
state's
money
on
those
employers
that
have
exhibited
a
fidelity
to
the
law
and
not
to
spend
their
money
on
those
who
have
violated
the
law.
mr.
charles
d.
hoornstra
yes.
the
other
side
of
the
same
coin,
namely,
if
we're
going
to
reward
those
employers
who
are
exemplary
by
giving
them
our
business,
we
necessarily
will
decide
that
we
do
not
want
to
encourage
labor
law
violations
by
giving
those
violators
our
business.
in
either
event,
it
remains
a
purchasing
decision,
where
we
are
buying
our
goods
for
our
purpose.
to
shape
the
issue
with
some
more
precision,
we
want
to
be
able
to
make
the
choice,
the
choice
consumers
generally
enjoy,
the
choice
trading
partners
in
the
private
sector
enjoy
when
they
are
engaged
in
proprietary
conduct,
to
make
the
decision.
we
want
to
give
our
business
to
those
employers,
those
companies,
that
demonstrate
the
best
in
corporate
america
and
we
would
rather
not
have
to
hire
people
who
have
violated
the
labor
laws.
the
holding
of
the
seventh
circuit--
mr.
charles
d.
hoornstra
--yes,
your
honor.
we
have
another
statute
that
prohibits
our
purchasing
department
from
buying
the
goods
from
those
that
have
demonstrated
a
proclivity
to
discriminate
against
minorities,
women,
and
a
rather
expanded
class
of
protected
persons
within
the
equal
rights
area.
mr.
charles
d.
hoornstra
basically,
without
that
precise
formulary,
and
without
a
deference
to
the
federal
machinery
since
we
have
co-equal
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
that
ourselves.
but
otherwise,
in
substance
it
is
the
same.
mr.
charles
d.
hoornstra
we
don't
have
anything
as
express,
your
honor,
but
i
think
i
can
say
that
our
catchall
statute
of
rewarding
contracts
to
the
lowest
responsible
bidder,
we
would
regard
as
a
catchall
authorization
so
we
don't
have
to
deal
with
organized
crime
either.
we
choose
not
to,
even
though
they
might
be
the
low
bidder.
similarly
with
an
employer--
mr.
charles
d.
hoornstra
--correct,
so
we're
prepared
to
lose
money
on
a
particular
deal
if
we're
dealing
with
discrimination.
we
might
pay
a
higher
price
but
as
a
matter
of
policy,
when
we're
spending
our
money
what
do
we
want
to
encourage?
fidelity
to
law.
we
assert
that--
mr.
charles
d.
hoornstra
--that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
d.
hoornstra
yes.
mr.
charles
d.
hoornstra
yes.
mr.
charles
d.
hoornstra
well,
permit
me
first
to
say
that
those
questions,
i
believe,
are
all
fourteenth
amendment
questions,
not
nlra
pre-emption
questions.
it
may
be
that
our
statute
is
subject
to
infirmity
for
those
reasons,
but
not
for
nlra
pre-emption.
let
me
turn
more
directly
to
the
question
of
whether
it's
a
penalty.
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
i
think
we
have
to
concede
that
the
opposite
side
of
the
coin,
of
the
same
coin,
of
trying
to
reward
the
best
in
corporate
america,
is
that
you're
going
to
have
as
an
effect
the
same
thing
as
though
a
penalty
were
exacted
on
the
violator.
the
effect
is
the
same
only
in
this
respect,
and
it's
a
narrow
effect.
that
is
that
they
are
going
to
have
a
lost
business
profit-making
opportunity,
but
it
stops
and
it
starts
right
there,
and
i
think
i
can
demonstrate
that
this
is
not
a
penalty
within
the
remedial
concept
of
the
nlra
and
the
machinery
of
the
nlrb
by
a
number
of
different
considerations.
first
is,
your
honor,
that
question
wouldn't
arise,
were
a
private
employer,
a
private
company
standing
here
rather
than
the
state.
it
wouldn't
arise
because
we
instantly
would
discern
a
distinction
between
the
economic
pain
that
befalls
someone
who
has
lost
a
customer,
from
a
regulatory
penalty.
we
can
admit
the
effect
is
the
same
in
other
respects,
but
there
is
that
distinction,
that
we
would
say
if
a
private
employer
were
here,
that
is
an
economic
pain,
not
a
remedial
penalty.
second,
i
think
that
as
the
holding
of
this
court
in
camden
crystallized
the
meaning
of
the
market
participant
cases,
insofar
as
the
state
does
act
as
a
proprietor
or
as
a
consumer,
there
can
be...
there
can
be
no
conflict
or
interference
with
the
federal
regulatory
machinery.
further,
this
court
in
the
withdrawal
of
subsidization
cases
has
held
that
a
penalty
is
not
involved
if
a
sovereign
state
or
the
federal
government
withdraws
subsidy
for
the
exercise
of
even
a
fundamental
constitutional
right.
i'm
referring
to
the
mcrae
v.
harris,
buckley,
regan
line
of
cases.
now,
obviously
we
are
well
within
the
circumference
of
that
holding.
first
we
are
not
refusing
to
subsidize
the
exercise
of
a
fundamental
constitutional
right.
we
are
simply
declining
to
enter
into
a
voluntary
agreement.
second,
there
isn't
a
fundamental
constitutional
right
involved
here.
there
is,
to
be
sure,
a
valued
right,
a
very
valued
right,
and
that
is
the
right
of
a
consumer
to
make
its
choices.
it
is
the
right
of
a
proprietor
to
choose
its
trading
partner.
and
that
is
our
right.
finally,
in
respect
to
the
question,
justice
blackmun,
whether
it
is
a
penalty,
there
is
this
very
easy
conceptual
difference.
we
are
not
taking
money
from
a
particular
company
to
put
it
into
our
treasury.
that
is
what
the
gist
of
a
penalty
is.
we
are
taking
money
from
our
treasury,
and
the
question
is
which
of
two
companies
are
we
going
to
spend
it
on,
and
that's
why
we
come
back
to
the
two
sides
of
the
coin
analog
i
used
earlier.
mr.
charles
d.
hoornstra
that's
true.
i
think--
mr.
charles
d.
hoornstra
--no,
you
understand
correctly,
your
honor,
and
i
think
i
understand
the
purport
of
your
question.
i
think
my
response
to
your
question
as
first
framed
is,
our
ordinary
experiences,
we
ordinarily
have
a
choice
of
two
or
20
or
50,
but
you
are
right.
if
we
were
down
to
a
single
source
supplier
our
statute
would
apply
in
that
event
as
well.
mr.
charles
d.
hoornstra
it
was
passed
in
may
of
1980.
mr.
charles
d.
hoornstra
no.
mr.
charles
d.
hoornstra
i
don't
know.
i
would
have
to
speculate
on
the
political
motives
and
of
course,
as
your
honor
appreciates,
we
judge
legislation
and
its
purpose
by
what
it
says.
it
is
an
infrequent
occurrence.
there
are
some
other
parallels
in
other
states,
and
i
think
its
infrequency
probably
accounts
for
the
fact
that
congress
has
not
had
occasion
to
address
this
kind
of
conduct.
but
in
explaining
that,
and
admitting
that,
we
are
saying
that
congress
did
not
address
it
and
that,
of
course,
in
any
pre-emption
case
is
the
touchstone,
did
congress
address
this
conduct.
we
have
two
premises
that
underlie
our
basic
argument.
one,
any
private
company
could
do
exactly
what
we
have
done.
it
would
be
free
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
to
do
exactly
what
we
have
done.
any
private
consumer
could
make
exactly
this
precise
choice,
and
i
believe
that
is
conceded
by
the
appellee.
second,
the
second
premise
is,
the
states
enjoy
the
same
rights
as
any
private
company
when
it's
doing
the
same
thing,
namely
making
a
proprietary
choice
or
a
consumer
choice.
there
are
two
sources
for
this
second
premise,
because
that
i
want
to
dwell
on
inasmuch
as
the
appellee
does
not
concede
it.
first,
the
dormant
commerce
clause
cases
expressly
have
held
that
the
states,
when
operating
in
the
free
market,
may
operate
freely
and
as
stated
in
reeves
specifically,
evenhandedness
as
a
matter
of
federalism,
evenhandedness
requires
that
states
operate
as
free
from
federal
constraint
as
a
private
company.
so,
simply
as
a
general
matter
of
our
federalism,
when
we're
doing
exactly
what
the
private
sector
regularly
does
and
have
on
our
proprietor
hat,
we
have
the
same
freedom.
mr.
charles
d.
hoornstra
yes,
sir.
i
come
to
my
second
source
because
of
exactly
that
question.
the
next
logical
question
is,
that
might
be
true
as
a
general
matter,
but
is
it
true
in
an
nlra
situation,
and
i
think
the
answer
is
yes.
first,
as
noted,
the
private
company
could
do
this.
second,
there
is
nothing
on
the
face
of
the
nlra
to
distinguish
the
states
acting
as
proprietors
from
the
private
companies.
third,
i
think
this
court
specifically
has
put
the
states
in
the
position
of
the
protected
proprietor
and
the
protected
consumer
in
the
nlra
itself.
i
have
in
mind
as
a
lead
case
the
1959
decision
of
this
court,
plumbers
versus
poor
county,
where
one
of
our...
which,
incidentally,
is
a
wisconsin
county,
one
of
our
counties
was
building
a
courthouse
and
it
was
victimized
by
what
we
call
secondary
boycott
activity
of
unions.
the
question
is,
is
the
state
or
a
political
subdivision
within
that
principle
of
secondary
boycott
law
when
it's
trying
to
build
its
buildings,
that
it
preserves
its
own
freedom
of
choice
of
a
trader,
or
is
the
state,
because
it's
a
state
or
a
political
subdivision
removed
from
these
protections
of
neutrals
in
the
business
economy
who
are
to
be
free
from
this
kind
of
union
coercion.
this
court
clearly
held
that
even
though
states
and
political
subdivisions
are
not
employers
covered
by
the
act,
and
even
though
there
is
what
we
call
the
garmon
pre-emption
doctrine,
when
it
comes
to
preserving
the
freedom
of
choice
that
the
secondary
boycott
law
is
all
about,
the
states
and
the
political
subdivisions
enjoy
those
same
benefits.
may
i
give
this
example
to
further
illustrate
that
the
states
under
the
nlra,
justice
rehnquist,
enjoy
the
same
prerogatives
as
though
there
weren't
an
nlra
when
it
comes
to
proprietary
choices.
were
gould's
union
to
appeal
to
the
officials
of
the
state
of
wisconsin,
please
don't
do
business
with
gould
because
we've
got
a
union
labor
dispute,
that
would
be
protected
activity
by
the
union
under
this
court's
cervette
doctrine
going
back
25
years
now,
i
think.
the
reason
it
would
be
protected,
and
the
union
could
appeal
to
wisconsin
not
to
do
business
with
its
employer,
is
because
wisconsin
in
that
circumstance
is
in
the
position
of
a
proprietor,
a
business
person
making
a
business
choice,
and
that
appeal
could
be
made.
finally--
mr.
charles
d.
hoornstra
--no,
sir.
mr.
charles
d.
hoornstra
absolutely.
i'm
happy
for
the
opportunity
to
respond
to
that.
our
point
is
very
narrow,
justice
stevens.
the
fourteenth
amendment
inhibits
all
our
decisions,
even
as
a
proprietor.
that's
why
one
of
my
early
responses
to
justice
blackmun's
question
was,
those
considerations
he
raised,
we've
got
to
meet
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
but
not
under
the
nlra.
mr.
charles
d.
hoornstra
i
have
a
real
problem
with
that
under
the
privileges
and--
mr.
charles
d.
hoornstra
--i
think
that
would
be
a
negative
inhibition
on
wisconsin
under
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
charles
d.
hoornstra
that's
correct.
so,
i
want
to
come
back
to
this
point.
we
have
a
different
set
of
inhibitions
that
will
restrain
us,
that
won't
restrain
a
private
company.
but
there
is
nothing
restraining
us
from
this
decision,
just
as
there
is
nothing
restraining
a
private
company
from
this
decision,
and
it's
this
convergence
of
two
distinct
capacities
that
come
together
here.
mr.
charles
d.
hoornstra
the
second
circuit
has
said
yes,
and
the
other
side
of
that
coin,
it
said
it
can
have
contracts,
the
state
can
have
a
contract
with
union
printers
only.
that,
your
honor,
remains
undecided,
in
my
opinion,
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
charles
d.
hoornstra
under
the
nlra,
that's
right.
but
i
would
have
a
first
amendment
problem,
being
a
state,
because
of
freedom
of
association
rights,
and
i'd
have
a
fourteenth
amendment
problem
but
i
don't
think
i'd
have
an
nlra
problem.
if
i
may
approach
this
from
the
perspective
of
burdens
and
presumptions,
i
want
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
appellee
has
the
burden
here
of
defending
the
seventh
circuit's
decision
for
these
reasons.
first,
it
is
clear,
i
believe
conceded,
that
a
private
company
as
a
general
matter
could
do
exactly
this
and
that
as
a
general
matter
a
state
can
do
what
a
private
company
can
do,
absent
a
fourteenth
amendment
or
first
amendment
problem.
that
being
so,
and
the
intent
of
congress
always
being
the
touchstone
in
an
nlra
pre-emption
case,
the
burden
switches
to
my
appellee
friend
to
say
where
it
is
that
congress
has
single
out
the
state
for
disparate
treatment.
mr.
charles
d.
hoornstra
i
concede
i
have
a
problem
defending
that
statute,
that
i
wouldn't
have--
mr.
charles
d.
hoornstra
--pardon?
mr.
charles
d.
hoornstra
yes,
yes.
mr.
charles
d.
hoornstra
because
in
the
circumstance
you
raised,
the
state
is
acting
as
a
lawgiver.
mr.
charles
d.
hoornstra
because
the
pre-emption
issue...
the
pre-emption
issue
turns
on
where
you've
got
conflicting
regulations
and
when
the
state
acts
as
a
regulator,
as
a
lawgiver
in
an
area
acted
by
congress,
that's
what
pre-emption
is
about.
mr.
charles
d.
hoornstra
because
it's
a
spending
power
decision,
and
that's
why
i
think
the
significance
of
this
court's
statement
in
camden
cannot
be
underscored
enough.
mr.
charles
d.
hoornstra
the
spending
power
cases,
i
submit,
say
that
you
may
engage
in
a
spending
power
decision
which
is
not
regulation,
even
though
you're
serving
the
same
kind
of
purpose,
so
long
as
you're
dealing
with
your
buying
power.
one
example--
mr.
charles
d.
hoornstra
--it
might
be,
but
if
our
touchstone
is
the
intent
of
congress
to
limit
somebody's
buying
power
in
trying
to
influence
the
conduct
of
others,
inasmuch...
especially,
i
should
say,
since
we're
dealing
with
a
sovereign
prerogative
of
making
policy
choices
for
its
people,
the
burden
is
pretty
heavy
simply
as
a
matter
of
the
principles
of
our
federalism
to
show
why
congress
would
want
to
say
to
a
state,
you
have
to
deal
with
these
law
violators
even
if
you
don't
want
to.
federalism
itself--
mr.
charles
d.
hoornstra
--that's
true,
and
in
no
circumstance
where
those
considerations
apply
do
they
apply
to
someone
making
a
purchasing
decision,
a
buying
decision.
we're
talking
about
from
whom
we
buy
our
goods
with

decisive
difference.
i
have
no
further
argument
to
make.
thank
you.
