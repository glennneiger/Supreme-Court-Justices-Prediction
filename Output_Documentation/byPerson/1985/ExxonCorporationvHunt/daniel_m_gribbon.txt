mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
appeal
is
whether
a
tax
on
oil
and
chemicals
imposed
by
new
jersey
in
order
to
finance
a
spill
fund
to
be
used
for
the
cleanup
of
hazardous
wastes
is
pre-empted
by
an
act
of
congress.
as
part
of
the
comprehensive
environmental
response,
compensation
and
liability
act
of
1980,
commonly
referred
to
as
cercla,
congress
imposed
a
tax
on
oil
and
chemicals
to
finance
a
superfund
to
start
cleaning
up
hazardous
wastes
nationwide.
section
114-c
of
the
federal
act
pre-empts
other
funds
whose
purpose
is
to
pay
for
response
costs,
damages
and
claims
which
may
be
compensated
under
cercla,
the
key
words
being
"may
be
compensated".
this,
then,
is
an
express
pre-emption
case
similar
to
the
aloha
airlines
case
that
the
court
decided
two
years
ago,
and
unlike
implied
pre-emption
cases
such
as
that
submitted
to
you
just
now,
there
is
no
need
to
inquire
whether
congress
intended
pre-emption
of
state
action.
here
it
is
undisputed
that
congress
has
pre-empted
some
state
taxation
for
cleanup
purposes,
and
the
question
is
whether
the
new
jersey
spill
fund
escapes
that
pre-emption.
it
is
clear
on
the
face
of
a
new
jersey
statute
which
was
passed
in
1977
that
the
purpose
of
the
spill
fund
was
to
clean
up
hazardous
wastes
in
accordance
with
the
national
contingency
plan.
three
years
later,
congress
came
along
and
passed
cercla
to
accomplish
the
same
cleanup
purpose
on
a
nationwide
basis.
there
can
be
no
question,
therefore,
that
a
purpose
of
the
spill
fund
was
really
to
do
the
same
thing
as
cercla,
to
pay
claims
that
after
1980
might
be
compensated
under
cercla,
in
the
sense
that
they
are
eligible
for
payment
under
cercla.
it
is
appellant's
contention
that
spill
fund
is
thus
pre-empted
because
its
purpose
is
to
pay
costs
of
response,
damages
and
claims
that
qualify
for
compensation
under
cercla.
in
holding
that
the
spill
fund
is
not
pre-empted,
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
read
the
statutory
language,
cercla>
["]
to
mean
actually
paid
under
cercla,
rather
than
eligible
or
qualified
for
payment.
this
interpretation
as
we
understand
it
would
serve
only
to
pre-empt
state
funds
that
are
established
for
the
purpose
of
paying
response
cost
damage
claims
actually
paid
by
the
federal
government.
no
state,
we
submit,
would
ever
have
any
reason
to
impose
taxes
or
to
create
a
fund
for
the
purpose
of
paying
claims
that
are
actually
paid
by
the
federal
government.
on
the
other
hand,
the
interpretation
of
<one
fourteen
one
hundred>
[=
114-c],
we
urge,
gives
the
pre-emption
real
meaning.
certainly
congress
intended
that
it
was
to
have
some
real
meaning.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
i
will
comment
on
it
right
now,
justice
o'connor.
the
solicitor
general
rejects
new
jersey's
view
that
the
pre-emption
is
limited
to
claims
actually
paid.
he
goes
on
to
say
that
the
new
jersey
statute
is
partially
pre-empted
by
the
federal
statute.
he
arrives
that
way
by
distinguishing
between
claims
that
new
jersey
would
pay
that
are
submitted
by
third
parties
as
against
payments
made
directly
by
the
state,
even
for
the
same
purpose,
and
therefore
he
says
that
the
pre-emption
is
only
to
the
extent
that
new
jersey
honors
claims
that
are
submitted
to
it
and
it
does
not
cover
direct
payments
made
by
the
state
to
accomplish
exactly
the
same
purpose.
and,
it
is
that
second
part
where
we
disagree
with
him
and
feel
there
is
no
basis
in
the
statute
or
in
its
legislative
history
for
making
this
arbitrary
distinction
between
claims
submitted
to
new
jersey
and
work
done
directly
by
new
jersey
that
accomplishes
the
same
purpose.
actually,
the
new
jersey
statute
is
very
clear
that
everything
that
it
pays
is
put
in
terms
of
claims
and
compensation,
and
similarly
cercla
recognizes
that
a
state--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
--all
payments
made
by
the
state
itself
are
regarded
as
payment
of
claims,
because
there
is
a
new
jersey
environmental
department
that
submits
claims
to
the
treasurer's
department
and
the
treasurer
then
pays
them,
so
that
new
jersey
does
not
recognize
this
distinction
that
the
solicitor
general
purports
to
see
between
paying
claims
for
third
parties
and
doing
the
work
yourself.
that
really
doesn't
make
any
sense.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
your
honor,
we
would
agree
with
that
interpretation.
that's
precisely
what
we
say,
that
to
the
extent
a
claim...
to
the
extent
a
response
or
damage
claim
does
qualify
under
cercla
and
can
be
paid,
then
the
state
is
pre-empted
from
resorting
to
a
tax
on
oil
and
chemicals
to
pay
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
could
tax
chemical
and
oil
and
make
a
payment,
except
for
sites
that
are
on
the
national
contingency
plan,
an
earlier
list
where
removal
without
any
kind
of
approval
from
epa
can
be
compensated
under
epa,
and
a
lot
of
the
expenses
of
the
state
of
new
jersey
are
removal
expenses.
cercla
distinguishes
between
remedial
and
removal,
and
there
is
a
broader
right
to
the
states
in
removal.
essentially,
i
think
i'm
in
agreement
with
your
statement
that
the
state
could
create
a
fund
by
taxing
oil
and
chemicals
as
long
as
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
dealing
with
non-cercla
qualified
matters.
new
hampshire
has
precisely
that
kind
of
a
statute,
and
we've
referred
to
it
in
our
brief.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
yes,
that
is
correct.
if
they
qualify,
if
they
will
go
to
the
federal
government
and
say,
we've
spent
this
money,
or
this
needs
to
be
done
and
we
qualify
for
payment,
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
well,
to
some
extent
it
does.
it
has
presently
in
this
spill
fund
an
accumulation
of
$25
million
that
it
hasn't
spent,
and
it
has
spent
very
heavily...
pardon?
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
it
may
be
because
the
federal
government
has
paid
90
percent
of
the
cost
of
cleaning
up
sites
in
new
jersey.
it
has
spent
more
money
in
new
jersey
than
it
has
in
any
other
state,
and
new
jersey
has
benefited
from
that
and
it
still
keeps
in
its
fund
this
$25
million
that
it's
collected
from
the
tax
on
oil
and
chemicals.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
it
shows
the
$25
million
accumulation.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
but
to
say
exactly
why
that's
there,
that's
impossible.
it
shows
these
two
things,
new
jersey
participating
heavily.
indeed,
it
says
in
its
official
report,
it's
among
the
leaders
in
competition
for
the
national
superfund
dollars.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
in
the
federal
statute,
a
state
is
recognized
as
an
appropriate
claimant,
something
that
the
solicitor
general
overlooked
or
didn't
pay
any
attention
to.
but
there
isn't
any
reason
why
the
state
can't
be
a
claimant
for
superfund
monies
in
accordance
with
the
words
of
the
statute.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
well,
the
new
jersey
statute
is
written
that
way,
and
i
think
the
reason
for
it
is
that
there
are
these
two
different
departments
of
the
state,
the
environmental
department
on
the
one
hand
which
does
the
work
or
that
contracts
it
out
and
the
treasury
which
holds
the
money.
indeed,
in
the
whole
area
of
environmental
work,
claims
and
compensation
have
been
used
fairly
interchangeably
with
no
distinction
as
to
whether
the
state
does
the
work
directly
or
the
federal
government
does
the
work
directly,
or
pays
for
having
it
done.
i
would
just
like
to
say--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
--we
believe
it
would,
your
honor,
the
reason
being
twofold:
in
the
first
place
the
pre-emption
goes
to
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
new
jersey
never
took
any
steps
to
change
the
purpose
of
its
statute
after
cercla
was
passed.
it
could
have
done
that.
indeed,
the
new
jersey
statute
in
'77
recognized
that
there
could
come
along
a
federal
statute
that
would
be
pre-emption
and
it
directed
that
at
that
time
there
be
a
review
and
re-examination.
that
never
took
place.
moreover,
the
non-cercla
funds
that
expenditures
have
been
made
by
new
jersey
are
quite
insignificant,
about
six
percent
of
the
total
fund,
the
record
appears
to
show
at
least
in
the
earlier
years.
so,
we
believe
that
since...
initially,
let
me
concede,
new
jersey
could
have
split
the
fund.
it
could
have
decided,
we're
going
to
collect
so
much
for
all
spills
which
are
not
governed
by
cercla
and
we're
going
to
collect
so
much
for
chemicals
which
are
not
covered.
it
did
not
do
that,
and
indeed
the
tax
rate
was
originally
set
to
cover
all
kinds
of
hazardous
waste,
not
just
oil
spills,
and
that
tax
rate
has
never
been
changed
even
though
in
1980
the
tax
would
have
gone
off
through
a
capping
provision
in
the
statute
if
it
were
not
for
the
hazardous
waste
claims.
new
jersey's
experience
with
oil
spills
was
so
favorable
that
they
would
have
had
enough
money,
were
it
not
for
these
hazardous
wastes.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
no.
congress
is
considering
it,
indeed
they're
going
to
debate
it
again
tomorrow,
and
they
have
three
bills
up
there.
all
of
the
bills
they
are
talking
about
would
significantly
increase
the
amount
of
money
and
would
go
to
a
broad-based
tax
of
some
sort
and
would
take
the
whole
burden
as
it
now
rests
off
oil
and
chemicals.
if
that
were
to
happen
under
all
these
bills,
the
pre-emption
would
disappear.
the
oil
and
chemicals
would
no
longer
be
bearing
what
was
recognized
as
a
disproportionate
burden
of
the
tax,
and
the
pre-emption
would
disappear.
it's
entirely
possible,
though,
that
they
are
not
going
to
arrive
at
any
kind
of
agreement
and
the
present
bill
would
simply
be
extended
and
the
pre-emption
presumably
would
continue,
although
that
remains
to
be
seen,
if
oil
and
chemicals
continue
to
bear
the
disproportionate
burden.
on
the
words
of
the
statute,
and
it
isn't
a
big,
comprehensive
sort
of
a
statute,
i
will
emphasize
only
this,
that
the
"may
be
compensated",
particularly
the
"may
be",
reflects
the
potential
and
not
the
certainty
of
payment
that
actually
paid.
which
was
not
used,
which
would
reflect...
and
by
examining
cercla
a
state
legislature
can
determine
what
kinds
of
claims
qualify
for
payment
and
which
don't,
and
if
they
think
the
need
is
there,
create
another
fund
even
by
a
tax
on
oil
and
chemicals
and
that,
as
i
say,
is
exactly
what
new
hampshire
has
done.
there
are
other
aspects
of
section
114,
for
example,
the
exemption
from
pre-emption
and
a
provision
against
double
taxation
in
114-b,
which
we
submit
fully
support
our
view
that
looking
solely
at
the
statute
itself,
new
jersey's
view
strips
it
of
meaning
and
doesn't
give
proper
significance
to
the
words
that
are
used
in
there.
let
me
turn
briefly
to
the
objectives
and
purposes
of
cercla,
which
we
submit
fully
support
the
interpretation
of
the
pre-emption
that
we
urge.
this
was
compromise
legislation
jammed
through
in
the
1980
lame
duck
session
with
very
little
in
the
way
of
explanation
as
to
just
exactly
what
congress
meant.
there
were,
for
example,
no
reports.
accordingly,
one
has
to
look
at
what
was
said
and
discussed
during
about
two
years
of
legislative
gestation
that
this
bill
was
going
through.
two
strains
in
that
discussion,
i
submit,
give
real
content
to
the
pre-emption.
the
first
one
is
about
money,
where
it
was
going
to
come
from
and
how
much
they
were
going
to
need.
they
finally
decided
that
a
fund
of
$1.6
billion
would
be
enough
to
make
a
start
on
this
massive
job.
now,
this
money
could
have
come
from
general
revenues
because
all
of
us
in
some
measure
bear
some
responsibility
for
hazardous
wastes.
it
could
have
come
from
a
tax
on
generators.
these
are
manufacturers,
miners,
milling
people,
some
260,000,
who
directly
contribute
to
this.
nonetheless,
it
was
decided
not
to
do
that,
to
impose
this
tax
only
on
oil
and
chemicals,
some
30
chemicals,
with
the
result
that
about
400...
about
900
taxpayers
bore
the
entire
burden
of
the
federal
waste
program.
thereafter,
there
was
considerable
discussion
and
concern
that
those
people
should
not
be
taxes
again
for
this
purpose,
at
least
for
the
five-year
experimental
period
during
which
cercla
was
to
be
in
effect.
so
that,
the
basic
consideration
there
was
a
recognition
that
oil
and
chemicals
were
bearing
a
disproportionate
burden
of
the
cost
of
federal
waste
cleanup,
and
that
at
least
for
this
period
when
the
federal
program
was
getting
itself
going
and
finding
what
needed
to
be
done,
they
shouldn't
be
subject
to
multiple
state
taxation.
they
could
have
been
taxed
in
all
50
states.
the
other
theme
that
runs
through
the
discussions
is
the
need
to
provide
for
federal-state
cooperation
in
order
to
achieve
effectively
this
nationwide
program
of
dealing
with
the
waste,
and
this
involved
the
states
nominating
sites
and
working
with
the
federal
government,
and
indeed
paying
ten
percent
of
the
total
cost.
so,
it
was
necessary,
and
many
legislators
suggested
that
this
was
going
to
be
difficult
enough
with
one
federal
program
without
having
up
to
50
other
state
programs
competing
in
this
prioritization,
competing
for
human
resources
and
financial
resources.
so,
those
two
strains,
i
submit,
fully
support
our
contention
that
what
was
intended
was
that
the
states
would
not
put
additional
taxes
on
oil
and
chemicals
for
these
same
purposes,
and
it
didn't
have
to
do
with
actual
payment
but
rather
with
the
purpose
of
the
tax.
now,
the
new
jersey
supreme
court,
in
accepting
the
actually
paid
argument,
relied
almost
entirely
on
a
single
incident
in
the
legislative
history
of
cercla,
and
in
a
colloquy
on
the
senate
floor,
senator
randolph,
the
floor
leader,
did
agree
in
response
to
two
complicated
leading
questions
from
senator
bradley
that
pre-emption
extends
only
to
funds
whose
purpose
is
to
pay
claims
actually
paid
by
superfund.
i
submit
that
in
the
first
place,
any
court
should
be
extremely
cautious
in
according
very
much
weight
to
such
an
isolated
exchange,
particularly
when
it
strays
so
far
from
the
words
of
the
statute.
moreover,
it
is
at
least
as
likely
as
not,
if
you
look
at
the
context
of
that
statement,
that
senator
bradley
in
his
curt
agreement
to
senator
randolph,
in
his
agreement
to
senator
bradley,
had
in
mind
pre-existing
state
funds.
these
were
funds
that
had
collected
money
before
the
effective
date
of
cercla,
and
senator
randolph
at
great
length
explained
that
there
was
no
pre-emption
involved
there.
that
money
could
be
spent
however
they
wanted
to
spend
it.
and,
new
jersey
had
a
deep
interest
in
that
because
it
did
have
such
a
fund.
it
should
be
noted
in
this
connection
that
earlier
in
this
colloquy
both
senator
bradley
and
senator
randolph
referred
to
pre-emption
as
extending
to
claims
and
damages
compensable
under
cercla,
and
"compensable"
and
"may
be
asserted"
were
the
terms
that
were
used
most
frequently
throughout
the
legislative
discussion,
along
with
this
concern
to
prevent
federal
taxation.
i
think,
in
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
i
have
dealt
with
an
argument
new
jersey
makes
which
appears
to
be
that
even
if
our
view
of
the
pre-emption
is
accepted,
this
spill
fund
should
nonetheless
survive.
one
reason
is
that
it
says
it
has
other
purposes,
these
being
the
oil
spill,
particularly,
and
as
i
indicated
the
purpose
is
what
is
important
and
they
haven't
changed
the
tax
rate,
and
the
oil
spill
expenditures
are
very,
very
small.
the
other
argument
that
it
seems
to
make
is
that
in
fact
it
has
refrained
from
spending
money
on
certain
sites.
now,
even
if
that
were
factually
correct,
and
i'll
show
in
just
a
moment
that
it
is
not,
we
submit
that
spill
funds
should
still
be
stricken
because
it
is
not
the
manner
in
which
the
money
is
spent
that
determines
pre-emption,
it
is
the
purpose,
and
the
purpose
remains
to
clean
up
hazardous
wastes,
the
same
purpose
as
cercla.
however,
the
records
that
are
before
the
court
here
show
that
new
jersey
did
not
refrain
from
spending
on
cercla
sites.
$32
million
out
of
about
$36
million
that
was
spent
have
gone
to
cercla
sites,
cercla
qualified
sites.
some
of
that,
a
small
amount
of
it,
about
$2
million,
may
be
new
jersey's
portion
of
the
superfund
expenditures,
but
that
could
not
be
in
excess
of
about
two
and
a
half
million
dollars.
this
is
all
shown,
as
i
say,
in
papers
that
are
with
the
court.
they
were
brought
in,
really,
in
response
to
new
jersey's
effort
to
avoid
pre-emption
by
forgetting
about
the
purpose
and
looking
to
the
manner
in
which
the
expenditures
were
made.
i
submit
that
that
will
not
work,
because
it
is
purpose
that
is
the
key
figure
here,
and
even
if
you
look
to
expenditures,
substantial
amounts
of
money
have
been
spent
on
the
cercla
sites.
i
would
like
to
refer
only
briefly
to
the
brief
filed
by
california
and
seven
other
states
as
amici.
i
would
further
look,
because
i
believe
it
highlights
the
narrow
issue
that
is
presented
for
decision
here.
as
that
brief
puts
it,
a
number
of
states
did
create
funds
to
supplement
and
complement
federal
superfund,
and
that
is
perfectly
permissible.
new
jersey
made
no
such
effort.
it
failed
even
to
abide
by
the
provision
in
its
own
statute
which
said,
if
there's
federal
legislation,
take
a
look
at
this.
indeed,
during
the
course
of
that
legislation,
one
of
the
legislators
recognized
that
there
was
apt
to
be,
before
too
long,
federal
legislation
which
would
pre-empt
dual
taxes
by
the
state
and
the
federal
government.
but
they
didn't
do
that.
they
continued
right
along
with
their
statute,
and
it
appears,
and
this
is
borne
out
by
our
description
of
the
40
other
state
funds,
in
the
appendix
to
our
reply
brief,
that
alone
among
the
states
new
jersey
has
imposed
a
very
duplicative
tax
on
oil
and
chemicals
that
was
in
the
mind
of
the
framers
of
the
pre-emption
provision
in
114-c.
as
far
as
these
other
funds
are
concerned,
they
all
appear
to
be
financed
through
general
revenues,
which
is
not
pre-empted,
or
in
some
other
way
that
does
not
impose
on
oil
and
chemicals
the
disproportionate
burden
which
was
the
essential
reason
for
the
pre-emption
written
in
114-c.
accordingly,
it
is
our
contention
that
new
jersey
spill
fund
alone
transgresses
the
pre-emption
and
should
be
accordingly
set
aside.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
if
you
please,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
if
please
the
court,
let
me
make
clear
that
it
is
our
position
that
this
is
a
question
of
law.
the
case
was
put
to
the
courts
below
on
motions
for
summary
judgment
as
to
what
the
proper
meaning
of
section
114-c
was.
our
view
of
it
differs
from
that
of
the
new
jersey
district
court
and
it
also
differs,
as
justice
white
pointed
out,
from
the
view
that
the
state
is
now
putting
up
here.
we
do
regard
that
as
a
question
of
law,
as
to
just
what
congress
meant
in
enacting
114-c.
the
figures
that
it
referred
to
came
into
this
case
in
response
to
new
jersey's
defense
of,
don't
look
to
the
purpose,
look
at
what
we
did
with
the
money.
and
that
is
a
basic
difference
between
them.
we
believe
that
pre-emption
clearly
goes
to
purpose,
and
really
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
manner
in
which
the
expenditures
were
made.
so,
we
made
the
alternative
argument
that
based
on
new
jersey's
own
official
records,
it
was
clear
that
they
had
not
limited
their
expenditures
to
non-cercla
qualified
sites,
and
that
is
all
that
the
legal
issue
is
about.
lest
there
be
too
much
concern
for
new
jersey
being
hobbled
in
its
efforts
to
do
something
about
hazardous
waste,
this
is
a
very
small
pre-emption
that
congress
felt
necessary
when
it
put
the
whole
burden
of
the
federal
waste
cleanup
program
on
oil
and
chemicals.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
general
revenues.
i
believe
that
justice
stevens
pointed
out,
they
can
spend
their
general
revenues
any
way
they
want
to.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
money
that
they
can
borrow,
and
new
jersey
has
borrowed
$100
million
and
has
it
sitting
up
there,
which
it
hasn't
used.
so,
it
really
is
a
very
modest
inroad
into
what
they
might
do
and
it
was
put
there
clearly,
as
the
legislative
history
will
show,
because
congress
was
concerned
about
duplicative
taxes,
not
just
new
jersey
but
any
other
state,
on
oil
and
chemicals,
which
largely
out
of
expediency
had
been
made
to
carry
the
whole
financial
burden
of
the
federal
waste
program.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
i
think
they
could.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
that
doesn't
qualify.
they
can't
get
that
ten
percent
from
the
federal
government
under
cercla.
that
has
to
be
paid
by
the
state.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
legislative
action
frequently
is
not
complete,
and
this
was
done
in
an
awful
hurry.
for
example,
the
language
is
broader
than
oil
and
chemicals,
as
counsel
has
pointed
out.
our
position
there
is
that
the
legislative
history
is
so
very
clear
that
the
only
thing
they
were
worried
about
was
the
duplicative
tax
on
oil
and
chemicals.
that
would
probably
be
a
decision
that
the
court
would
arrive
at.
and
by
the
way,
justice
stevens,
counsel
conceded
that
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
overlap
between
114-b
and
114-c.
there
is
so
much
overlap
there
that
114-c
isn't
necessary.
114-b
takes
care
of
the
double
taxation
problem
which
they
would
like
to
limit
114-c
to.
