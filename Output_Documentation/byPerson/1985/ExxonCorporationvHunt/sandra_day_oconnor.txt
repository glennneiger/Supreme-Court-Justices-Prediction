mr.
gribbon,
i
think
the
solicitor
general
in
a
brief
filed
with
us
takes
the
position
that
is
neither
yours
nor
the
appellee's.
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
sg's
position.
do
you,
and
would
you...
do
you
plan
to
comment
on
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
don't
understand
that
last
statement.
are
you
saying
that
under
the
new
jersey
scheme
all
payments
would
be
made
to
the
state
itself,
in
effect?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
it's
also
possible
to
argue
that
what
the
statute
means
is
pre-empted.
is
it,
not
only
things
that
could
actually
be
paid
by
the
federal
government
because
it's
part
of
the
national
priority
list,
but
sites
or
damage
that
are
not
included
in
any
national
priority
list
would
never
be
paid
by
the
federal
government
and
therefore
are
not
pre-empted?
now,
what
about
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
if
there
is
a
site
in
new
jersey
that
isn't
on
the
priority
list
of
the
federal
government
and
of
epa,
then
you
would
think
the
state
could
make
its--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
gribbon,
if
we
agreed
with
your
interpretation
of
the
statute,
would
all
the
money
ever
collected
by
new
jersey
to
put
in
its
superfund
have
to
be
refunded?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
may
i
just
ask
you
one
more
question
while
i
have
you
interrupted,
please.
i
understand
congress
is
presently
considering
legislation
affecting
the
superfund.
is
there
anything
in
the
present
proposals
before
congress
addressing
itself
to
this
question
of
pre-emption?
