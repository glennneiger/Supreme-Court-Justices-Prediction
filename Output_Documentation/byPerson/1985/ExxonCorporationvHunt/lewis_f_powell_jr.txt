justice

f.
powell,

--mr.
gribbon,
along
the
line
of
your
answers,
what
if
the
federal
government
pays
claims
to
the
state,
perhaps
would
pay.
what
does
the
state
do
with
the
money
derived
from
its
taxes
where
the
federal
government
had
paid
the
claim
already?
the
state
raises
taxes,
and
i
understood
you
to
say
the
taxes
are
raised
to
pay
claims
that
the
federal
government
under
the
superfund
act
already
will
pay.
is
that
correct?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
assume
that
the
claims
do
qualify
for
federal
payment.
does
the
state
have
a
windfall
with
the
taxes
it
has
raised?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
because
the
federal
government
has
paid
the
claims?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
said
"maybe".
i
suppose
the
record
just
doesn't
show?
