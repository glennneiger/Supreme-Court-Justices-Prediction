justice
byron
r.
white
--are
you
defending
the
decision
below
and
all
of
its
ramifications?
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
the
court
below
say
that
new
jersey
is
pre-empted
only
in
those
instances
where
superfund
actually
pays
something?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
defend
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
any
other
claim,
new
jersey
may
go
right
ahead
as
long
as
superfund
hasn't
actually
paid
even
though
there
is
a
realistic
chance
that
it
might?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
do
request
us
to
put
quite
a
gloss
on...
if
we
agree
with
you,
we
must
put
quite
a
gloss
on
the
new
jersey
supreme
court's
opinion?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
we
are
in
a
position
really
to
do
that?
did
you
make
this
kind
of
an
argument
in
the
new
jersey
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
have
thought
you
would
have
made
the
argument
that
they
bought.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
a
narrowing
or
their
argument,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
sounds
to
me
like...
the
new
jersey
court,
it
seems
to
me,
gave
the
state
of
new
jersey
much
more
freedom
than
you
say,
that
you
now
ask
for.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
agree,
may
not
a
state
be
a
claimant
under
the
superfund
program?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
a
state
goes
ahead
and
cleans
up
a
site.
may
it
make
a
claim
on
superfund?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
may
i
ask
while
you're
interrupted,
too,
do
you
agree
with
your
opponent
that
really
only
new
jersey
statute
is
at
issue
in
this,
that
he
contends
that
your
statute
is
unique
in
having
this
special
fund.
is
that
correct?
