mr.
gribbon,
while
you
are
interrupted,
i'd
like
to
pursue
a
little
further
justice
o'connor's
question
about
the
solicitor
general's
interpretation
of
the
statute
in
which
he
says,
the
word
"claims"
refers
to
third
party
claims
against
the
state.
as
i
understand
your
response,
you
are
saying,
well,
new
jersey
treats
a
claim
by
its
own
agency
against
the
state
treasury
as
a
claim.
but,
does
that
necessarily
answer
the
question,
what
the
word
"claim"
means
in
the
federal
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
sort
of
a
strange
way
to
write
a
statute,
though,
to
talk
about
claims,
compensation
for
claims,
to
mean
a
state
compensating
itself.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
interrupt
a
moment.
don't
those
provisions
just
generally
apply
to
state
action
that
might
well
be
financed
from
general
revenues?
justice
john
paul
stevens
section
114-a,
for
example,
doesn't
that
just
apply
to
state
action
that
could
well
be
financed
by
general
tax
revenues
instead
of
from
the
special
fund?
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
it's
not
limited,
but
at
least
it
would
be
effective.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because,
i
have
to
confess,
this
language,
does
the
new
jersey
spill
fund
provide
money
to
clean
up
damages
that
could
be
compensated
under
the
federal
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
mean
by
"realistically
eligible"?
i
guess
there
are
priorities,
and
a
lot
of
sites
are
eligible
that
may
not
actually
get
any
money.
you
say
they
are
not
realistically
eligible
unless
they
get
the
money,
is
that
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
explain
to
me
once,
i
know
you
have
got
it
in
your
brief
but
i
have
a
little
trouble
following
it,
why
isn't
114-c
duplicative
of
114-b
under
your
present
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
the
chance
is
good
enough
so
that
you
actually
get
the
money,
then
114-b
would
prohibit
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
gribbon,
on
that,
right
on
that
point,
in
your
view
could
they
have
a
special
fund
raised
from
the
oil
and
chemical
companies
just
to
finance
their
ten
percent
share
of--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
that's
hard
to
square
with
the
language--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
if
you're
looking
at
the
purpose
of
the
money,
it's
to
clean
up
things
that
are
eligible.
