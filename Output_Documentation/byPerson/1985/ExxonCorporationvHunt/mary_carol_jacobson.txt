ms.
mary
carol
jacobson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
new
jersey
has
one
of
the
worst,
if
not
the
worst
hazardous
waste
problem
in
the
country.
we
have
97
sites,
either
currently
on
the
national
priority
list,
or
nominated
to
the
national
priority
list,
maintained
by
the
united
states
environmental
protection
agency.
this
is
a
list
of
the
worst
sites
nationwide.
new
jersey
not
only
has
more
sites
than
any
other
state
but
has
more
than
ten
percent
of
all
the
sites
in
the
country,
on
the
list.
given
the
extent
of
this
problem,
which
actually
reaches
far
beyond
the
priority
sites,
those
that
actually
make
the
list,
because
of
this
problem
massive
amount
of
resources
are
needed
to
clean
up
these
sites
in
order
to
protect
the
public
and
the
environment.
the
new
jersey
legislature
responded
to
the
hazardous
substance
pollution
problem
and
the
threat
of
oil
spills
to
the
state's
coast
and
tourist
industry
in
1977
when
it
adopted
the
spill
compensation
and
control
act.
the
spill
act
provided
strong
liability
provisions
in
order
to
have
responsible
parties
pay
for
as
much
of
the
cleanup
as
possible,
but
it
also
provided
a
funding
source
for
those
cleanups
where
responsible
parties
were
not
available
to
finance
the
work.
new
jersey
relied
almost
exclusively
on
the
spill
act
for
funding
of
hazardous
substance
cleanup
from
1977
until
congress
adopted
the
federal
superfund
act
in
december
of
1980.
the
federal
act
provided
funding
for
the
cleanup
of
top
priority
sites
nationwide.
its
focus
was
limited
to
priority
sites
because
of
the
restricted
amount
of
financing
that
was
made
available
on
the
federal
level.
given
this
limited
federal
financing,
congress
itself
recognized
that
active
state
participation
and
financing
were
critical
to
achieve
the
cleanup
goals
envisioned
by
congress.
several
members
of
the
new
jersey
congressional
delegation
were
actively
involved
in
the
legislative
process
that
led
up
to
the
adoption
of
the
superfund
act,
most
notably
senator
bill
bradley
and
congressman
james
florio.
they
were
well
aware
of
the
state's
funding
mechanism
and
were
very
concerned
about
the
impact
that
the
new
law
would
have
on
new
jersey's
ability
to
continue
its
spill
fund
taxing
scheme.
senator
bradley
was
especially
concerned
about
the
impact
that
section
114-c
would
have
on
the
new
jersey
spill
act.
i'd
like
to
read
that
language
of
section
<one
fourteen
one
hundred>
[=
114-c]:
"except
as
provided
in
this
act,
no
person
may
be
required
to
contribute
to
any
fund,
the
purpose
of
which
is
to
pay
compensation
for
claims
for
any
cost
of
response
or
damages
or
claims
which
may
be
compensated
under
this
subchapter.
"
senator
bradley
then
questioned
senator
jennings
randolph
who
was
chairman
of
the
committee
on
environment
and
public
works
which
had
reported
the
bill
to
the
senate
as
to
the
effect
of
this
language
on
the
new
jersey
fund.
the
new
jersey
fund
was
thus
the
particular
context
for
the
colloquy
that
occurred.
the
gist
of
the
bradley-randolph
colloquy
which
is
quoted
extensively
in
the
briefs,
is
that
states
may
levy
special
taxes
on
industry
to
support
hazardous
substance
cleanups
and
related
costs
not
compensated
on
the
federal
level,
and
among
the
categories
of
expenditures
from
state
funds
that
were
explicitly
found
appropriate
in
the
colloquy
were
that
state
funds
could
be
used
to
pay
for
the
ten
percent
state
share
that
superfund
requires
as
a
prerequisite
for
financing
remedial
actions
on
the
federal
level.
they
also
specifically
said
that
state
funds
could
be
made
available
for
sites
that
were
eligible
for
compensation
on
the
federal
level
but
where
no
federal
financing
was
actually
provided.
and
thirdly,
they
said
that
state
funds
were
available
for
cleanup
costs
at
sites
that
were
initially
undertaken
by
the
federal
fund
but
where
the
work
had
to
be
stopped
prior
to
actual
completion
of
the
work.
although
mr.
gribbon
stated
that
there
was
an
argument
that
they
were
talking
about
state
funds
collected
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
act,
that
simply
is
not
borne
out
on
the
face
of
the
colloquy.
they
did
mention
in
their
discussion
of
the
statute
that
there
would
be
absolutely
no
pre-emption
whatsoever
for
funds
collected
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
federal
act.
when
they
got
to
the
end
of
the
colloquy,
however,
they
talked
about
particular
exemptions
from
pre-emption
that
were
available
under
the
language
of
section
114-c.
they
would
have
had
no
reason
to
talk
about
exemptions
for
funds
collected
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
act
because
they
weren't
pre-empted
at
all.
in
essence,
then,
the
language
of
section
114-c
was
drafted
to
enable
the
states
to
supplement
but
not
to
duplicate
the
federal
cleanup
program.
since
the
adoption
of
the
superfund
act,
new
jersey
has
administered
its
state
program
to
supplement
federal
cleanup
efforts.
as
interpreted
and
applied,
therefore,
new
jersey
is
using
its
special
tax
to
finance
cleanups
either
not
covered
on
the
federal
level
or
not
actually
compensated
by
superfund.
those
are
the
two
kinds
of
test
endorsed
by
the
new
jersey
supreme
court,
the
new
jersey
fund
could
be
used
for
items
not
covered
or
not
actually
compensated.
exxon's
assertion
that
the
state
has
misspent
spill
fund
monies,
under
our
own
interpretation
of
section
114-c,
is
first
of
all
irrelevant
and
second
of
all,
it's
flatly
wrong.
the
assertion
is
irrelevant
because
it's
not
part
of
the
record
in
this
case.
the
documents
that
they
rely
upon
were
lodged
with
the
court
by
exxon
in
recent
days,
but
they
were
not
relied
on
by
the
court
below.
secondly,
this
assertion
is
not
necessary
to
the
decision
in
this
case,
and
in
any
event
is
one
that
demands
a
full
factual
development
in
another
proceeding.
the
court
here
is
asked
to
define
the
permissible
uses
of
a
special
state
tax
in
the
hazardous
waste
cleanup
area
in
light
of
section
114-c.
this
is
a
legal
issue,
not
a
factual
issue,
and
it
had
always
been
treated
as
such
by
both
of
the
parties
until
exxon
reached
this
court.
once
that
legal
determination
is
made
as
to
what
uses
are
permissible
under
the
federal
act,
exxon
may
then
decide
to
challenge
the
state's
compliance
with
that
legal
determination.
such
a
proceeding
is
not
his
case,
which
was
decided
on
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment
on
the
extremely
limited
record.
exxon
recognized
as
early
as
the
state
tax
court
that
this
was
a
matter
for
legal
determination
and
not
a
factual
issue.
beyond
that,
exxon
had
distorted
the
annual
reports
that
it
has
submitted
to
this
court.
those
reports
simply
do
not
support
exxon's
contention
that
the
spill
fund
money
has
been
misspent.
they
focus
on
two
different
sites,
the
chemical
control
and
the
goose
farm
site.
the
reports
they
rely
upon
were
compiled
in
fiscal
years,
and
the
year
they
point
to
as
being
most...
or
the
worst
violation
by
new
jersey
was
1981.
fiscal
year
1981
runs
from
june
of
1980...
or
july
1st
of
1980
to
june
30th
of
1981,
and
a
good
almost
six
months
of
that
period
was
before
the
federal
act
was
ever
adopted.
also,
the
chemical
control
facility
that
they
focus
on
actually
blew
up
in
april
of
1981.
it
was
a
toxic
time
bomb
that
did
explode.
the
state
of
new
jersey
couldn't
wait
for
the
federal
government
to
make
its
decision
to
pass
a
federal
statute.
they
had
to
move
in
right
away
in
april
of
1980
and
committed
massive
amounts
of
funds.
in
fact,
they
actually
wiped
out
the
existing
balance
of
the
fund
in
1980,
responding
to
this
particular
site.
exxon
also
doesn't
recognize
that
there
was
a
start-up
period
that
epa
went
through
with
the
superfund
act,
that
there
was
no
rational
contingence
plan,
no
list
and
so
forth,
until
july
of
'82.
beyond
that,
new
jersey
did
apply
for
federal
funds
for
both
the
chemical
control
and
the
goose
farm
sites
from
the
only
then
available
source,
which
was
section
311-k
under
the
federal
clean
water
act.
a
schedule
attached
to
the
last
page
of
the
audit
report
for
fiscal
years
1983
and
1984,
which
exxon
has
lodged
with
the
court,
reflects
the
federal
reimbursement
under
this
program.
new
jersey
certainly
tried
to
get
the
federal
government
involved
in
the
chemical
control
and
goose
farm
sites
and
succeeded
on
a
limited
basis.
finally,
as
the
may
1985
report,
recently
lodged
with
the
court
by
exxon,
notes,
a
major
settlement
occurred
in
1984
between
the
spill
fund
and
the
company
that
had
been
under
contract
to
the
state
to
provide
cleanup
costs
for
those
two
sites.
disputes
over
the
amounts
due
and
owing
from
that
1980
explosion
have
thus
led
to
expenditures
in
years
subsequent
to
1980.
exxon's
factual
argument
must
thus
be
rejected
as
unsupportable
as
well
as
irrelevant
to
this
case.
returning
to
the
real
issue
at
hand,
which
is
the
meaning
of
section
114-c,
it's
important
to
remember
that
congress
did
not
say
that
states
could
not
tax...
or
could
not
have
special
taxes
to
fund
hazardous
waste
cleanups.
rather,
congress
linked
the
restriction
on
special
state
taxation
to
cleanup
and
damage
coverage
on
the
federal
level.
they
specifically
said,
to
claims
which
may
be
compensated
under
superfund.
at
this
point
i
would
like
to
address
what
exxon
claims,
there
were
two
major
strains
of
this
legislation.
i
think
they're
wrong
on
both
counts
of
the
themes
that
were
important
to
congress.
exxon
claims
that
congress
had
some
interest
in
protecting
the
petrochemical
industry
from
a
double
tax.
as
the
solicitor
general
points
out,
section
114-c
is
not
limited
in
any
way
to
petrochemical
companies.
the
language
reads:
"no
person
may
be
required
to
contribute
to
any
tax.
"
even
though
there
had
been
some
discussion
of
avoiding
a
double
tax
on
the
petrochemical
industry,
particularly
in
the
context
of
the
oil
spill
legislation
which
predated
the
superfund
act,
in
the
waning
days
of
the
congressional
session
congress
came
up
with
another
formulation.
they
endorsed,
"no
person",
which
would
limit
a
state's
tax,
a
special
tax
to
support
a
state
fund,
not
simply
a
tax
on
the
petrochemical
industry.
so,
exxon
is
wrong
on
that
count.
it
simply
is
not
supported
by
the
language.
the
second
thrust
of
their
argument
was
a
national
uniformity
argument
which
we
can
agree
with
only
up
to
a
point.
there
was
some
concern
by
congress
to
have
a
national
program.
they
created
the
national
contingency
plan
and
the
national
priority
list,
and
clearly
wanted
to
have
the
resources
available
on
the
federal
level
to
set
the
tone,
set
the
pace
for
the
rest
of
the
nation.
however,
they
did
allow
states
quite
a
bit
of
leeway.
if
you
look
at
section
114-a
of
the
act,
it
explicitly
states
that
the
states
may
add
whatever
requirements
they
want
in
regard
to
hazardous
substance
response
actions.
in
addition,
section
104
of
the
act
requires
extensive
state
participation
throughout
the
cleanup
process.
ms.
mary
carol
jacobson
section--
ms.
mary
carol
jacobson
--i
don't
believe
it's
limited
to
just--
ms.
mary
carol
jacobson
--it
would
be
effective
as
to
those,
yes.
ms.
mary
carol
jacobson
not
as
interpreted
and
applied
subsequent
to
the
adoption
of
section
114-c.
since
congress
adopted
that
statute,
the
state
has
administered
the
act
in
accord
with
our
interpretation,
which
allows
for
the
supplementation
of
the
federal
program
but
not
the
duplication
of
the
federal
program.
the
way
that
this
is
applied
on
a
practical
basis
is
that
the
state
has
maximized
its
use
of
the
federal
program
and
we
feel
that
the
actual
compensation
test
enunciated
by
the
new
jersey
supreme
court,
when
given
a
practical
application,
forces
us
into
the
federal
program
to
take
advantage
of
whatever
opportunities
are
available
to
us
on
the
federal
level.
it
does
place
a
restriction
on
us
because
the
site,
for
example,
is
on
the
national
priority
list.
new
jersey
has
to
pursue
federal
funding
for
that
site,
and
if
it
is
still
realistically
eligible
for
such
compensation
the
state
could
not
fund
that
site.
ms.
mary
carol
jacobson
while
there
is
a
possibility,
a
reasonable
possibility
that
the
money
will
be
forthcoming...
for
example,
if
epa
says
to
new
jersey
in
regard
to
a
particular
site,
it's
on
the
national
priority
list
but
we
don't
have
enough
money
to
go
around,
therefore
we
cannot
fund
this
site,
at
that
point
the
state
could
step
in
and
use
its
state
fund.
before
that,
if
new
jersey
wanted
to
upset
federal
priorities,
for
example,
or
if
they
wanted
to
fund
a
cleanup
that
was
not
consistent
with
the
national
contingency
plan,
or
assuming
one
that...
where
they
disagreed,
suppose
there
were
two
alternatives
under
the
plan
and
epa
endorsed
one
and
new
jersey
endorsed
a
different
cleanup,
under
those
circumstances
we
would
have
to
use
general
revenues
because
there
was
a
source
of
federal
funding
that
was
available
to
us
if
we
had
gone
along
with
the
federal
plan,
with
the
federal
program.
ms.
mary
carol
jacobson
well,
it
comes
right
out
of
the
argument
i've
just
made.
section
114-c
limits
new
jersey
from
spending
its
special
tax
for
sites
that
are
realistically
eligible,
where
there
is
some
good
chance
that
we
are
going
to
get
financing.
ms.
mary
carol
jacobson
114-b
and
also
114-c.
there
is
some
overlap.
114-b
goes
directly
to
whether...
prevents
double
compensation,
and
that
has
a
greater
applicability
than
114-c
because
it
prevents
double
compensation
from
any
source.
if
a
claimant
had
gotten
a
tort
remedy,
for
example,
or
an
insurance
recovery,
it
would
prevent
recover--
ms.
mary
carol
jacobson
--we
have
taken
the
actual
compensation
part
of
the
decision
below
and
have
given
it
what
we
feel
to
be
a
practical
application,
and
so
we
start
at
the
same
thing.
ms.
mary
carol
jacobson
they
use
the
terms
"actual
compensation".
ms.
mary
carol
jacobson
we
defend
the
actual
compensation
test
as
given
in
a
practical
way.
ms.
mary
carol
jacobson
we
would
differ
at
the
point.
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
didn't
put
any
flesh
on
the
bones
of
the
actual
compensation
test,
and
when
we
looked
at
the
test
and
were
faced
with
the
problem
of
implementing
it,
we
felt
that
the
court
had
not
recognized
the
important
state
role.
ms.
mary
carol
jacobson
a
gloss
in
terms
of
how
you
practically
apply
it,
yes.
you
take
it
beyond
what
they
have
said.
ms.
mary
carol
jacobson
yes,
we
have
made
this
argument
from--
ms.
mary
carol
jacobson
--we
think
this
is
just
an
extension
of
their
argument
and
one,
frankly,
that
gives
it
a
practical
application.
we
don't
see
it
as
being--
ms.
mary
carol
jacobson
--it
goes
beyond
their
argument.
ms.
mary
carol
jacobson
except,
the
new
jersey
court
did
not
address
how
the
test
was
to
be
applied,
although
they
did
suggest
at
page
35
in
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement,
that
congress
contemplated
that
the
federal
government
would
attempt
to
deal
with
the
problems
of
the
most
seriously
affected
sites
and
to
allow
states
to
maintain
a
compensation
fund
or
to
use
general
revenues
should
they
choose,
to
conduct
their
own
cleanup
efforts
on
those
sites
not
receiving
superfund
compensation.
so,
they
did

--the

we
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
that
when
you
use
"claims"
in
a
technical
sense
as
a
term
of
art
under
the
superfund
act,
that
a
state's
own

costs
are
not
claims.
you
don't
have
to
go
through
the
claims
process
set
forth
in
section
112,
for
example.
ms.

the
federal
fund
had
not
been
operated
that
way
by
epa.
they
do
not
operate
on
a
reimbursement
basis.
they
operate
on
a
contractual
or
cooperative
agreement
basis
in
which
the
state
must
agree
up
front
to
provide
ten
percent
of
the
costs
of
any
remedial
action.
so,
it's
not
a
reimbursement
program.
ms.

relying
upon
the
review
of
state
statutes
that
exxon
has
included
in
its
brief,
our
statute
does
seem
to
be
different
from
other
statutes.
that
may
be
a
timing...
there
may
be
a
timing
issue
in
there,
in
that
ours
was
adopted
in
1977.
in
fact,
in
many
ways
it
was
the
model
for
the
federal
superfund
act.
and,
this
litigation
was
brought
almost
on
the
very
heels
of
the
adoption
of
the
statute,
so
other
states
were
put
on
notice,
beware,
you
may
run
into
some
litigation
if
you
adopt
the
same
kind
of
statute
new
jersey
has.
interestingly,
though,
if
you
look
at
their
review
the
majority
of
the
statutes
are
financed
by
some
sort
of
special
tax
or
fee,
either
on
waste
generation
or
licensing
or
so
forth,
so
that
states
have
relied
upon
special
funds,
some
sort
of
dedicated
fund,
as
the
way
to
provide
their
share
of
federal...
of
the
federal
cleanup
program,
and
also
whatever
falls
outside
of
the
federal
cleanup
program.
if
you
look
at
the
two
schemes,
the
federal
and
the
state
schemes,
it's
helpful
in
finding
out
what
the
state
of
new
jersey
is
able
to
do
under
the
statute.
under
the
superfund
act
and
the
national
contingency
plan,
the
superfund
may
be
used
to
finance
up
to
90
percent
of
the
cost
of
cleanup
at
sites
on
the
national
priority
list.
states
must
pay
ten
percent
of
the
cost
or
more,
depending
on
whether
they
owned
or
operated
the
particular
site
in
issue.
states
are
also
responsible
for
maintenance
costs
at
sites.
if
a
site
is
not
on
the
national
priority
list,
however,
it's
not
eligible
for
federally
financed
remedial
action.
superfund
may
also
be
used
to
finance
emergency
removal
actions
in
acute
situations
such
as
where
you
have
acutely
toxic
substances
or
fire,
or
explosion
is
threatened,
or
public
drinking
water
supplies
are
threatened.
these
emergency
actions
may
continue
for
six
months
or
until
$1
million
is
spent,
whichever
comes
first.
those
two,
this
emergency
removal
and
the
long-term
cleanup
action,
those
two
areas
form
the
heart
of
the
federal
act.
given
that
federal
coverage,
what
is
left
for
new
jersey?
actually,
quite
a
lot,
if
you
look
at
the
state
scheme
in
relation
to
the
federal
scheme.
first,
in
regard
to
remedial
actions,
the
states
are
responsible
for
ten
percent
of
the
share
of
the
costs,
and
perhaps
even
more.
since
that
is
not
eligible
for
compensation
on
the
federal
level,
that
is
something
that's
clearly
an
appropriate
area
of
state
fund
expenditure.
both
the
bradley-randolph
colloquy
and
some
further
legislative
history
from
congressman
florio
in
the
house
debate,
support
this,
although
exxon
has
never
conceded
this
point.
beyond
that
is
the
issue
of
petroleum
spills.
exxon
has
conceded
that
the
state
may
use
its
special
tax
to
finance
the
cleanup
and
removal
of
petroleum
spills
and
related
damage
claims.
they
tend
to
make
this...
or
claim
that
this
is
a
peripheral
purpose
of
the
new
jersey
fund,
but
if
you
look
at
the
statute
itself
and
the
legislative
findings,
it's
crystal-clear
that
the
state
was
very
concerned
about
petroleum
spills
because
of
our
beaches,
the
tourist
industry,
and
so
forth.
having
a
contingency
plan
available
in
case
there
is
a
catastrophic
occurrence
in
regard
to
petroleum
is
thus
an
essential
part
of
the
new
jersey
fund.
the
new
jersey
fund
also
provided
coverage
for
property
damage.
although
congress
debated
the
possibility
of
covering
property
damage,
they
decided
at
the
last
minute
to
exclude
it
from
coverage
under
superfund
so
that's
another
area
that
the
new
jersey
fund
may
be
used
for.
beyond
that,
the
new
jersey
fund
may
be
used
for
administrative
costs,
personnel,
equipment
expenditures,
and
things
of
that
nature.
all
of
these
areas
are
significant,
and
are
those
areas
not
covered
on
the
federal
level.
consequently,
they
may
appropriately
be
the
subject
of
a
state
fund.
interestingly,
exxon
started
out
in
this
case
saying
that
we
could
use
our
fund
for
very
few
of
these
purposes.
in
fact,
even
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
at
page
8
they
suggest
that
the
only
possible
use
of
the
state
fund
is
to
pay
for
prepositioning
costs
which
are
mentioned
in
the
second
part
of
section
114-c.
it
was
clear
from
the
legislative
history,
however,
that
this
use,
prepositioning
and
equipment
cost,
was
simply
illustrative
and
not
exclusive.
another
area
that
has
been
ignored
by
exxon
are
the
regulations
contained
in
the
national
contingency
plan
relating
to
eligibility.
those
regulations
provide...
and
as
they
have
been
interpreted
by
epa,
provide
that
eligibility
for
superfund
financing
is
done
on
a
case
by
case
basis
because
of
the
limited
funding
involved.
exxon
talks
about
eligibility
and
compensability,
but
it
never
gets
right
down
to
the
fact
that
what
may
be
compensated
by
superfund
is
to
be
determined
by
epa
on
a
case
by
case
basis
because
of
the
realistic
funding
limitations
faced
on
the
federal
level.
it
is
this
opportunity
to
supplement
the
federal
fund
in
cases
where
congress
has
not
been
able
to
cover
the
area
that
gave
rise
to
the
actual
compensation
test
that
was
endorsed
by
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
and
that
we
have
already
discussed.
one
other
important
factor
is
to
realize
that
this
pre-emption
language
came
out
of
the
oil
spill
context
where
it
had
a
very
different
effect.
in
the
oil
spill
context,
when
they
first
debated
pre-emption,
the
congress
was
contemplating
a
program
that
was
much
more
comprehensive,
be
it
in
a
limited
sphere,
than
the
superfund
program.
they
were
looking
at
a
program
to
take
care
of
all
future
spills
into
navigable
waters,
and
cover
all
related
damages
of
the
kinds
that
congress
deems
could
be
accommodated
with
the
funds
to
be
made
available.
when
they
shifted
the
concept
into
the
superfund
area,
they
broadened
the
coverage
in
the
sense
of
applying
to
abandoned
sites.
it
no
longer
was
a
question
of
taking
care
of
future
spills,
but
all
the
sites
that
had
already
been
polluted,
and
recognized
that
they
could
only
address
this
on
a
priority
basis.
therefore
the
federal
coverage,
in
a
sense,
shrank
to
what
they
actually
could
cover
and
thereby
expanded
to
what
the
states
would
be
able
to
use
a
special
state
tax
for.
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
that
comes
out
of
the
oil
spill
bills,
the
house
was
very
definite
in
saying
that
the
pre-emption
was
limited
in
nature
and
was
not
meant
to
displace
the
states.
states
were
expected
to
have
state
funds
to
use
to
supplement
the
federal
program,
and
that's
essentially
what
we
say
congress
intended
when
they
adopted
the
superfund
measure,
to
allow
the
states
to
supplement
although
not
to
duplicate
federal
cleanup
efforts.
although
new
jersey
has
not
taken
legislative
action
to
change
its
spill
fund,
one
of
the
reasons
for
that
is
that
this
litigation
has
been
pending
for
the
last
four
and
a
half
years
and
in
the
course
of
that
time
the
state
fund
has
been
administered
consistently
with
the
position
that
we
have
taken
in
this
litigation,
so
the
fact
that
the
state
statute
recognized
that
a
federal
act
would
be
adopted,
certainly
is
not
at
all
dispositive
of
the
issue
before
this
court.
when
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
of
this
particular
provision,
when
you
look
at
the
language
of
the
provision
which
relates
the
limits
on
state
taxation
to
coverage
on
the
federal
level...
i
mean,
when
you
look
at
the
purpose
of
the
statute
as
a
whole,
of
promoting
cleanups
in
new
jersey
and
elsewhere,
it
is
inconceivable
to
us
that
congress
could
have
intended
to
wipe
out
the
new
jersey
spill
act
tax.
the
wiping
out
of
the
tax
would
mean
that
the
state
would
have
to
delay
cleanups,
perhaps
eliminate
cleanups,
go
back
to
the
drawing
board
to
come
up
with
a
new
tax,
and
where
you
have
a
dedicated
tax
you
don't
have
to
compete
with
general
revenues
for
much
needed
cleanup
dollars.
in
any
event,
this
was
a
decision
made
by
the
new
jersey
legislature
that
cleanup
should
be
done
by
the
oil
and
chemical
companies
and
those
people
who
benefited
from
the
substances
rather
than
from
the
general
taxpayers.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
conclude
the
argument
for
new
jersey.
thank
you.
