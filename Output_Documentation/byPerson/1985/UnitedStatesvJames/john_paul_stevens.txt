paul

i
just
wanted
to
ask
another.
maybe
this
is
the
same
thing,
but
is
the
footnote
accurate
in
the
majority
opinion,
there
are
23
cases
in
all,
and
only
two
of
them
really
deal
with
personal
injuries,
and
those
two
didn't
answer
the
question
squarely?
is
that
a
fair
summary?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
another
reason
for
granting
immunity
to
the
government?
i
remember,
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
pincus,
may
i
ask
one
other
general
question?
i
am
kind
of
puzzled
by
the
fact
that
although
there
are
some
23
or
24
cases
in
the
courts
of
appeals,
that
apparently
only
twice
before
did
this
issue
even
surface,
and
i
don't
now
whether
it
means
the
statute
is
just
as
clear
as
you
say
it
is
or
whether
cases
got
lost.
there's
so
few
cases
since
the
tort
claims
act
was
passed,
is
there
a
lot
of
litigation
in
the
district
courts
that
we
just
haven't
had
called
to
our
attention,
or
is
this
representative
sample
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
certainly
there
must
have
been
a
fair
number
of
accidents
that
are
somewhat
similar
to
this.
it's
a
strange
situation.
