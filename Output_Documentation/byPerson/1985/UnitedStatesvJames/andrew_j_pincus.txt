mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
the
wake
of
the
devastating
mississippi
river
flood
of
1927,
congress
embarked
upon
a
massive
federal
program
to
control
flood
waters,
directing
the
construction
of
public
works
on
a
massive
scale
in
order
to
prevent
a
recurrence
of
the
destruction
that
accompanied
the
1927
flood.
the
statute
implementing
this
program
included
a
comprehensive
provision
regarding
the
liability
that
could
be
imposed
upon
the
federal
government.
the
provision
states
"no
liability
of
any
kind
shall
attach
to
or
rest
upon
the
united
states
for
any
damage
from
or
by
floods
or
flood
waters
at
any
place.
"
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether,
in
light
of
this
provision,
which
has
been
codified
as
section
702(c)
of
title
33,
the
government
has
unambiguously
waived
its
sovereign
immunity
from
tort
liability
for
damage
caused
by
the
release
of
flood
waters
from
a
flood
control
project.
now,
this--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
it's
the
relationship
between
this
provision
and
the
tort
claims
act
that
is
at
issue
here,
and
we
think
in
light
of
this
provision,
the
tort
claims
act
could
not
be
taken
to
have
unambiguously
waived
the
government's
liability
in
this
area.
indeed,
in
light
of
the
tort
claims
act,
respondents
have
the
burden
of
showing
that
the
liability
for
which
they
seek
to
recover
was
unambiguously
not
covered
by
the
provision,
because
even
if
the
provision
was
ambiguous,
then
the
tort
claims
act
waiver
could
not
be
unambiguous.
so
we
think
in
a
way
they
have
quite
a
difficult
burden
to
overcome.
this
particular
case
arises
out
of
two
separate
incidents
in
which
respondents
suffered
damage
as
a
result
of
the
release
of
flood
waters
from
flood
control
projects.
the
first
incident
occurred
at
the
millwood
reservoir,
a
project
located
near
ashdown,
arkansas,
designed
to
control
flooding
by
the
red
river.
on
june
8,
1979,
the
reservoir
was
at
flood
level,
and
entrapped
flood
waters
were
being
released
through
the
reservoir's
dam.
respondents
james
and
butler
were
water
skiing
on
the
reservoir,
and
the
current
created
by
the
discharge
of
the
flood
waters
pulled
respondents
and
respondent
butler's
husband
through
the
dam's
gates.
respondents
were
injured,
and
respondent
butler's
husband
died.
the
district
court
found
that
the
government
had
violated
the
duty
of
care
imposed
by
state
law
by
willfully
and
maliciously
failing
to
warn
respondents
of
the
danger
caused
by
the
current
caused
by
the
discharge
of
the
flood
waters.
the
court
noted
that
the
current
had
swept
away
the
buoys
that
usually
marked
the
area
in
front
of
the
dam
where
the
current
was
strong.
the
district
court
entered
judgment
in
favor
of
the
government,
however,
holding
that
section
702(c)
barred
respondents'
tort
actions
because
respondents'
injuries
were
caused
by
flood
waters.
the
second
incident
at
issue
here
occurred
at
the
courtableau
drainage
structure,
a
flood
control
project
located
near
opelousas,
louisiana.
on
may
17,
1980,
the
bayou
courtableau
was
at
flood
level,
and
the
drainage
structure's
gates
were
opened
so
that
the
bayou
would
not
overflow
its
banks.
kenneth
and
joseph
clardy
were
fishing
in
the
bayou,
and
their
boat
became
caught
in
the
current
created
by
the
discharge
of
water
from
the
bayou,
through
the
drainage
structure.
the
boat
overturned,
and
kenneth
clardy
died.
the
district
court
in
that
case
granted
the
government's
motion
for
summary
judgment,
holding
that
respondent
clardy's
tort
claim
was
barred
by
section
702(c).
the
court
found
that
section
702(c)
applied
because
the
drainage
structures'
gates
had
been
opened
to
prevent
flooding,
and
the
diverted
waters
were
flood
waters
within
the
meaning
of
that
provision.
the
cases
were
consolidated
on
appeal,
and
the
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
the
panel
stated
that
prior
fifth
circuit
decisions
bound
it
to
hold
that
section
702(c)
barred
respondents'
claims,
but
it
indicated
that
it
disagreed
with
those
decisions.
the
full
court
of
appeals
reheard
the
case
en
banc
and
reversed
by
a
vote
of
nine
to
six.
the
court
concluded
that
section
702(c)
does
bar
certain
tort
claims,
but
that
the
statutory
immunity
did
not
extend
to
the
claims
asserted
by
respondents
in
these
cases.
the
dissenting
judges
stated
that
section
702(c)
did
bar
respondents'
tort
claims
and
argued
that
the
majority's
decision
was
contrary
to
the
statute's
claim
language,
it's
legislative
history,
and
settled
judicial
interpretation
of
that
provision.
we
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
unprecedented
construction
of
section
702(c)
is
incorrect
for
two
separate
reasons.
first,
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
and
the
statute's
legislative
history
permit
only
one
conclusion,
that
section
702(c)
immunizes
the
united
states
from
tort
claims
arising
cut
of
damage
caused
by
flood
waters
such
as
respondents'
claims
here--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
it
didn't
specifically
refer
to
personal
injury,
but
it
did
specifically
state,
wrote
quite
broadly,
it
said
no
liability
of
any
kind,
and
it
specifically
wrote
any
damage.
certainly,
if
congress
was
only
concerned
about
property
damage,
it
could
easily
have
just
written
in
property
damage
there,
and
this
court
has
construed
other
statutes
in
which
any
damage
is
used
to
refer
to
both
personal
injury
and
property
damage.
in
addition--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
your
honor,
we
think
in
light
of
the
broad
language
of
the
statute
that
the
question
really
is
whether
congress
somehow
intended
a
more
limited
meaning
to
be
given
to
the
provision,
and
that
in
light
of
this
court's
cases,
there
would
have
to
be
a
clear
indication
that
that
was
so
in
order
to
read
the
language
narrowly,
and
the
legislative
history
does
have
quite
a
bit
of
discussion
of
the
injuries
that
were
caused
by
the
1927
flood
and--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
your
honor,
we...
even
respondents
don't
contend
that
the
tort
claims
act
is
an
implied
repeal
of
section
702(c),
and
we
think
that
the
proper
result
would
be
to
read
the
statutes
together,
and
that
section...
that
the
tort
claims
act
would
waive
sovereign
immunity
in
the
areas
not
covered
by
section
702(c).
section
702(c)
would
be
analogous
to
one
of
the
exceptions
contained
in
the
tort
claims
act,
and
that
area
was
an
area
that
congress
declined
to
waive
its
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
we
just
don't
know
why
congress
might
not
have
done
that,
but
this...
it
may
well
be
that
they
knew
the
statute
was
on
the
books
and
felt
it
wasn't
necessary.
there
is
no
indication
one
way
or
the
other.
but
certainly
there
is
a
list
in
the
tort
claims
act
legislative
history
of
the
statutes
that
the
tort
claims
act
was
meant
to
repeal,
and
this
statute
is
not
included
among
them.
and
we
think,
given
the
high
standard
that
has
to
be
satisfied
in
order
to
find
an
implied
repeal,
there
certainly
couldn't
be
an
implied
repeal
in
this
case.
and
we
think
what
congress
was
really
doing
in
1928
was
embarking
on
a
new
venture.
it
was
a
very
large
construction
project,
the
largest
kind
of
public
works
project
the
federal
government
had
ever
engaged
in,
and
it
was
a
project
involved
in
an
area
of
considerable
danger
and
hazard,
as
evidenced
by
the
flood
that
had
just
occurred
the
year
before,
and
we
think
that
702(c)
is
really
read
as
an
insurance
clause,
to
make
sure
that
whatever
happened,
the
entry
of
the
federal
government
into
this
area
could
not
be
interpreted
by
any
court
or
anyone
else
as
waiving
any
aspect
of
the
government's
sovereign
immunity
except
to
the
limited
extent
that
there
were
certain
exceptions
in
the
statute
itself.
we
think
congress
just
wanted
to
make
very
sure
that
in
this
expensive
and
dangerous
enterprise
there
was
not
going
to
be
any
unexpected
liability
because
the
cost
was
already
so
great
that
the
legislature
was
concerned
that
it
not
be
increased.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
your
honor,
1946.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
no,
your
honor,
there
isn't.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
for
several
reasons,
justice
powell.
first
of
all,
the
language
of
section
702(c)
does
not
restrict
its
application.
it
says
it
applies
to
damage
at
any
place,
and--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--no,
your
honor,
and
we
think
that
is
one
of
the
striking
differences.
most
of
the
other
provisions
are
restricted
to
the
mississippi
river
or
the
specific
projects
authorized
in
the
statute,
and
they
contain
limiting
language
of
that
type.
but
the
immunity
language
of
702(c)
does
not
contain
that
particular,
any
kind
of
limitation.
and
also--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--no,
your
honor.
no.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
your
honor.
we
cite
both
in
our
opening
brief
and
on
page
19
of
our
reply
brief
three
cases
that
specifically
address
the
question,
and
there
are--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes,
and
they
all
hold--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--that
702(c)
applies
to
all
statutes,
and
in
fact,
there
are
many
other
court
of
appeals
decisions
that
do
not
address
the
question
expressly
but
that
apply
702(c)
where
it
is
clear
that
the
project
was
not
authorized
under
the
'28
act.
i
think,
in
fact,
that
most...
the
vast
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
decisions
that
we
cite
apply
section
702(c)
to
statutes
not
authorized
under
the...
to
project,
rather,
not
authorized
under
the
1928
act.
and
i
just
wanted
to
add
one
more
point
in
response
to
your
question,
justice
powell.
in
the
debate
on
the
'28
act
and
in
the
statute
itself,
it
is
clear
that
congress
viewed
this
as
the
first
step
in
a
larger
flood
control
project.
there
are
many
references
in
the
legislative
history
to
subsequent
projects
that
would
be
authorized
in
the
future,
and
the
statute
itself
contains
a
provision
directing
the
army
corps
of
engineers
to
study
future
projects,
including
projects
to
control
the
flooding
on
the
red
river
that
the
millwood
dam
eventually
was
built
to
control,
so
that
it
is
clear
that
when
congress
enacted
the
'28
statute,
it
wasn't
just
looking
at
those
projects,
it
was
aware
that
it
was
establishing
a
new
program
and
that
there
would
be
subsequent
statutes
in
the
future
authorizing
additional
projects.
in
addition
to
the
language
in
the
legislative
history
which
we
think
clearly
supports
our
position,
the
settled
interpretation
of
section
702(c)
we
submit
is
an
additional
reason
for
this
court
to
construe
the
statute
in
our
favor.
since
the
first
appellate
court
construed
section
702(c)
in
the
national
manufacturing
company
case
in
1954,
every
court
of
appeals
has
concluded
that
the
statute
bars
actions
against
the
united
states
for
damage
caused
by
flood
waters.
and
in
other
contexts,
this
court
has
observed
that
it
is
reluctant
to
overturn
a
statute's
settled,
traditional
interpretation
where
there
has
been
unanimity
among
the
courts
of
appeals.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
think
the
court
has
said
that
where
congress...
well,
generally,
it
promotes
a
settled
interpretation
of
the
law,
and
also,
where
there
is
a
settled
interpretation,
congress
can
be
assumed
or
in
some
cases
as
been
made
expressly
aware
of
the
interpretation.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
don't
think
you
have
said
that,
but
there
is
an
indication
in
this
case
that
congress
did
know
about
the
construction
of
section
702(c)
to
which
we
refer.
in
1960
a
private
bill
seeking
recovery
for
flood
damages
was
referred
to
the
court
of
claims
for
an
assessment
by
congress,
and
the
court
of
claims
in
its
report
back
to
congress
specifically
noted
that
the
claimants
would
have
no
action
against
the
united
states
at
law
because
section
702(c)
was
a
settled
bar
to
any
tort
liability.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
this
was
a...
this
was
a
property
damage
claim,
but
the
court
of
claims
did
not
distinguish
between
property
damage
and
personal
injuries.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
your
honor,
that's
a
summary.
let
me
make
two
other
observations.
those
two
cases
didn't...
did
not
not
address
the
question
because
of
any
concern
that
the
rule
might
not
apply.
they
didn't
address
the
question
for
other
reasons.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
right.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
they
are
neutral
to
the
extent
that
they
don't
expressly
hold
either
way,
but
certainly
they
all
read
the
section
as
very
broad.
they
don't
accept...
they
don't
see
the
tort
immunity
as
flowing
out
of
any
concern
with
property.
they
see
the
tort
immunity
as
an
expression
of
a
global
congressional
concern
not
to
have
any
liability
associated
with
the
project.
so
i
think
to
that
extent
they
do
support
our
position
because
they
don't...
they
don't
really
look
at
those
cases
as
property
cases.
they
look
at
them
as
liability
cases,
and
they
conclude
that
no
liability
should
be
imposed
on
the
government.
in
view
of
the
clarity
and
breadth
of
the
language
of
the
statute,
we
submit
that
respondents
really
bear
the
burden
of
trying
to
find
in
the
legislative
history
some
narrowing
principle
that
would
allow
them
to
assert
their
claims
against
the
government.
the
court
has
stated
many
times,
most
recently
in
the
dimension
financial
case
this
term
that
where
the
language
of
the
statute
is
clear,
the
quest
for
the
meaning
of
the
statute
is
at
an
end
because
it
is
through
the
language
of
the
statute
that
congress
most
directly
expresses
its
intent,
and
here
the
language
of
the
statute
is
very
clear,
and
we
think
that
respondents
have
to
come
forward
and
show
clear
congressional
intent
to
limit
that
broad
language,
and
they
just
haven't
done
so.
indeed,
what
is
particularly
striking
about
this
case
is
that
neither
respondents
nor
the
court
of
appeals
have
suggested
a
narrow
construction
of
the
statute
that
is
consistent
with
the
language
or
supported
by
the
legislative
history
or
common
sense.
they
have
come
up
with
five
or
different...
five
or
six
different
interpretations
of
the
statute,
but
that
in
itself
shows
that
there
is
no
clear
congressional
intent
as
to
the
one
limiting
interpretation
because
the
parties
trying
to
limit
the
statute
have
simply
been
unable
to
agree
among
themselves.
and
at
bottom,
we
think
that
respondents
and
the
court
of
appeals
simply
disagree
with
the
policy
determination
that
underlies
the
rule
of
immunity
adopted
in
section
702(c)
and
that
their
narrow
constructions
of
the
statute
are
designed
to
implement
that
contrary
policy
determination.
we
submit
that
those
are
arguments
that
should
be
addressed
to
congress,
and
congress
may
well
decide
that
it
is
appropriate
to
change
the
rule.
but
in
light
of
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
that
course
is
not
available
here.
i
would
just
like
to
address
briefly,
justice
o'connor,
your
concern
about
the
legislative
history
and
property
damage.
it
seems
to
me
that
one
problem
with
limiting
the
statutory
immunity
to
tort...
to
barring
tort
liability
only
when
related
to
property
damage,
it's
difficult
to
see
why
congress...
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
indicates
that
particular
result.
there's
nothing
that
divides
tort
liability
between
personal
injury
and
property
damage.
mr.
andrew

pincus
but
it
also
would...
it
also
was
immune
from
property
damage
liability
suits.
i
mean,
that's...
the
reason
that
we
think
that
the
provision
is
best
interpreted
as
a
broad
assertion
of
immunity
is
that
there...
it
was
immune
from
all
these
things.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
no,
your
honor,
but
no
one
claims
that
the
provision
bars
actions
for
damages
required
by
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
it
is
possible,
but
again,
that
kind
of
distinction
doesn't
appear
in
the
legislative
history,
and
it
certainly
doesn't
appear
in
the
language
of
the
statute,
and
the
court
has
said
in
its
previous
cases
that
even
if...
that
are
cited
in
our
brief,
even
where
the
examples
in
the
legislative
history
may
be
limited
to
a
particular
area
where
congress
writes
broadly
in
the
statute,
then
the
statute,
absent
some
congressional
intent
to
limit
the
statutory
language,
the
statute
should
not
be
limited
to
those
examples
in
the
legislative
history,
and
we
think
that
is
true
here,
although
the
legislative
history
history
may
have
focused
on
one
particular
kind
of
example
or
another.
it
also
indicates
that
there
was
a
broad
concern
with
liability
of
all
kinds,
and
we
think
that
the
provision,
that
the
broad
language
of
the
statute
reflects
that
and
was
an
intent
to
just
set
a
firm
rule
to
avoid
any
questions
that
might
arise
in
the
future.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
not
that
i'm
aware
of,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
what
the
answer
might
be.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
if
possible,
i
just...
i
can't
explain
it,
and
again,
i
think,
i
think
it
equally
could
be
plaintiffs
that
are
deterred
because
of
the
statute
as
anything
else,
and
that
may
well
be
the
likely
answer,
and
there
are
not
that
many
appellate
court
cases,
given
the
long
period
of
time
that
the
statute
has
been
in
effect.
so
that
may
well
explain
it.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
a
few
things,
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all,
with
respect
to
respondents'
first
point,
i
think
the
cases
that
they
rely
upon
in
arguing
that
the
statute
should
be
narrowly
construed
are
cases
dealing
with
personal
immunity,
and
the
court
has
made
it
quite
clear
that
when
the
government's
sovereign
immunity
is
at
issue,
precisely
the
reverse
presumption
is
applicable.
with
respect
to
their
argument
about
recreational
versus
flood
control
activities,
i
think
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
it's
indisputable
that
the
flood
waters
caused
the
damage
here,
and
that
the
damage
would
not
have
occurred
without
the
flood
waters,
and
certainly
would
not
have
occurred
if
the
flood
control
project
hadn't
been
in
existence,
and
we
think
that
that
is
enough
for
the...
to
satisfy
the
language
of
the
statute
which
refers
to
any
damage
from
or
by
flood
waters.
indeed,
the
release
of
flood
waters
that
caused
the
damage
here
is
precisely
what
congress
would
have
foreseen
as
what
would
happen
in
the
operation
of
the
flood
control
projects
that
it
was
authorizing.
and
finally,
our
position
also
comports
with
what
the
courts
of
appeals
have
decided
with
respect
to
this
issue.
they
have
all...
the
courts
that
have
addressed
this
question
of
multiple
activities
or
multiple
causation
have
all
stated
that
the
damage
must
be
wholly
unrelated
to
flood
control
or
flood
waters
in
order
for
section
702
immunity
to
be
withdrawn,
and
we
think
if
that--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes,
your
honor,
as
long
as
the,
as
long
as
the
flood
waters
were
a
legal
cause
of
the,
of
the
damage,
which
might
be--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes,
that's
our
position,
if
the
two
causes
were
completely
unrelated,
leaving
aside,
for
example,
the
intentional
tort
exception
to
the
tort
claims
act,
if
the
federal
employee
shot
someone
in
a
boat--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--no,
no,
i
understand.
all
i'm
saying
is
if
there
are
two
completely
independent
causes,
if
the
waters
are
not...
if
the
damage
would
have
been
incurred
without
the
presence
of
the
water,
we
don't
assert
that
section
702(c)
applies,
but
if
the
waters
are
necessary,
then
we
think
that's
what
congress
intended
because
the
statute
represents
a
decision
about
competing
policies,
compensating
people
versus
building
this
vast
project,
and
we
think
that
congress
decided
that
in
order
to
embark
upon
the
flood
control
activities,
it
had
to
ensure
that
its
sovereign
immunity
would
be
complete,
and
as
a
result
of
that,
although
there
may
be
people
like
respondents
who
are
unable
to
obtain
relief
in
court,
there
is
a
flood
control
system
that
protects
a
great
many
people
from
damage
due
to
flood
waters,
and
respondents
have
other
remedies
available.
they
can
seek
a
private
bill
in
congress,
or
they
can
seek
to
have
the
statute
amended.
that's
all
i
have.
