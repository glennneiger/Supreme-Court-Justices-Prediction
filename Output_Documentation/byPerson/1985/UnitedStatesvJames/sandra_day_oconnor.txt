justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
pincus,
at
the
time
it
was
enacted,
i
guess
the
federal
government
was
not
liable
for
personal
injury
suits;
it
was
before
the
federal
tort
claims
act
had
been
passed.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
there
is
some
indication
from
the
language
of
the
full
statute
and
the
history
that
congress
was
worried
in
section
702
about
property
damage
claims.
and
it
certainly
didn't
speak
in
the
statute
in
terms
of
personal
injury,
did
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
just
seemed
to
me
that
the
legislative
history
didn't
paint
the
clear
picture
that
you
say
it
did
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
and
then
you
have
the
concern
that
even
if
the
language
should
be
read
broadly
as
you
suggest,
then
what
is
the
effect
of
the
subsequent
passage
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
is
kind
of
curious,
isn't
it,
that
the
congress
didn't
make
this
an
exception
when
it
was
making
out
its
exceptions
for
the
tort
claims
act?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it's
just
that
the
government
was
immune
from
personal
injury
suits
at
that
time;
probably
didn't
think
about
it
very
much.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
ward,
i
guess
the
district
courts,
though,
did
find
that
the
damages
were
caused
by
flood
waters.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
they
didn't
find
that
damages
were
caused
by
operation
of
the
ferry
boat
on
flood
waters,
they
found
that
here
these
people
were
drowned
by
the
flood
water.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
i
think
that
answers
part
of
your
argument,
i
must
say.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
mr.
pincus,
if
a
federal
employee
was
out
on
the
reservoir
in
a
motor
boat
to
carry
out
his
duties
and
negligently
ran
over
some
swimmer,
and
the
swimmer
then
drowned
in
the
flood
water,
the
government
is
immune?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
water
in
the
reservoir
filled
the
lungs
of
the
swimmer,
and
the
swimmer
died
as
a
result
of
being
run
over
by
the
federal
officer.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
my
example
was
negligence.
