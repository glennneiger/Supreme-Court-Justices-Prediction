justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
take
it,
mr.
pincus,
if
it
weren't
for
this
provision,
there
would
be
little
question
that
it
had
waived
that
liability
by
virtue
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
reason
does
the
court
ascribe
for
its
reluctance?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
have
we
ever
said
that
it
simply
can
be
assumed
that
congress
knew
about
it
without
any
indication,
that
congress
in
fact
did
know
about
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
was
this
claim
one
for
property
damages
or
one
for
personal
injury?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
wasn't
immune
from
takings
claims.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
but
congress
may
have
focused
on
the
sort
of
invasion
of
property
interests
that
do
not
amount
to
a
taking
but
that
might
nevertheless
have
given
rise
to
some
sort
of
a
claim
for
property
damage
in
connection
with
a
takings
claim
more
readily
than
if
we
are
simply
looking
at
the
whole
spectrum
of
tort
liability.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
agreed
with
this
position
of
yours,
mr.
ward?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
and
in...
the
decision
cast
in
those
terms
would
not
really
be
an
affirmance
of
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
isn't...
isn't
there
a
recreational
aspect
to
almost
all
flood
control
projects?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
it
is
still
the
control
of
flood
waters,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you...
though
you
get
a
recreational
use
by
virtue
of
backing
up
waters
behind
a
dam,
to
keep
up
the
waters.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
there
is
a
considerable
relationship
between
the
two.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
wouldn't
have
the
recreational
use
if
you
didn't
have
the
flood
control
dam.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
ward,
when
you...
it's
hard
to
think
of
a
statute
cast
in
more
sweeping
terms.
as
judge
gee
pointed
out
in
his
dissent,
no
liability
of
any
kind
shall
attach
to
or
rest
upon
the
united
states
for
any
damage
from
or
by
floods
on
flood
waters
in
any
place.
how
could
congress
have
written
a
broader
exemption
than
what?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why,
when
the
legislative
history...
when
the
legislative
history
is
clear,
why
do
you
look
any
further?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
saying
that
there
was
an
implied
repeal
of
702(c)?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
do
you
get
that
from?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
name
one
of
them.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that's
a
kind
of
an
immunity
that
is
created...
announced
by
this
court.
that's
not
created
by
statute,
is
it?
