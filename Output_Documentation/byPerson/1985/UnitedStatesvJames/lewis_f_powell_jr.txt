mr.
pincus,
the
millwood
project
was
constructed,
as
i
recall,
and
a
statute
enacted
in
what,
1946?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
there
was
no
provision
in
it
comparable
to
section
702(c).
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
how
do
you
reason
that
702(c)
applies
to
subsequently
authorized
dam
projects?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
are
there
any
other
provisions
of
the
act
of
1928
that
apply
to
all
subsequent
water
control
projects?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
is
there
any
other
provision
in
the
1928
act
that
applies
to
all
subsequent?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
may
i
ask
one
other
question
in
this
connection?
you
cite
a
number
of
authorities,
court
of
appeals
decisions
that
on
the
face
appear
to
support
your
position.
does
any
one
of
those
address
the
issue
raised
here
with
respect
to
the
millwood
project,
or
did
it...
what
i
am
saying
is
did
any
of
those
cases
involve
a
project
built
under
a
subsequent
statute
to
the
statute
of
1928?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
specifically
address
the
question
i
have
asked
you.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
all
apply
702.
