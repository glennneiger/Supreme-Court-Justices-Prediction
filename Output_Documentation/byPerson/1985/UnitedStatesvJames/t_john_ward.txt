mr.
t.
john
ward
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
respondents
would
like
to
present
two
of
the
arguments
set
forth
in
their
brief
this
morning
in
support
of
their
position.
the
two
arguments
that
we
will
present,
we
contend
that
section
702(c)
was
not
contend...
not
intended
to
immunize
the
government
from
tort
claims
from
which
it
was
already
immune,
but
rather,
it
was
enacted
and
the
intent
was
to
deal
with
a
special
problem
created
by
congress'
decision
to
compensate
certain
property
owners
for
certain
types
of
flood
damages.
and
secondly,
even
if
702(c)
does
bar
ordinary
tort
claims,
it
is
not
applicable
to
the
claims
of
the
respondents
because
the
respondents'
injuries
in
this
case,
these
cases,
arose
from
the
government's
mismanagement
of
recreational
activities,
totally
unrelated
to
flood
control.
now,
we
would
like
to
start
out
and
direct
the
court
to
the
second
argument
there,
that
is,
that
if
we
assume
for
purposes
of
argument
only
here
this
morning
that
702(c)
does
grant
immunity,
then
even
assuming
that,
it
doesn't
dispose
of
the
respondents'
claims
because
the
immunity
has
no
applications
to
the
respondents'
damages
which
were
caused
by
the
government's
negligence
in
the
management
of
recreational
activities
unrelated
to
flood
control.
mr.
t.
john
ward
possibly.
i
just
don't
know,
your
honor.
i
have
a
hard
time...
we
did
not
present
that
in
our
brief
per
se
in
the
court
of
appeals
originally.
we
argued
that
at
the
time
before
the
fifth
circuit,
but
that
was
not...
what
it
went
off
on
is
close
to
it,
but
i
believe
that
they
go...
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
is
broader
than
what
we
argued,
and
what
we--
mr.
t.
john
ward
--that
is
correct,
not
of
the
reasoning;
of
the
result
only.
we
brought
these
claims
pursuant
to
the
tort
claims
act,
and
under
the
district
court's
findings
of
fact
and
under
the
allegations
in
the
clardy
case,
it
is
clear
that
we
are
dealing
with
the
government's
negligence
that
is
unrelated
to
flood
control,
and
that
they
are
solely
related
to
the
mismanagement
of
recreational
facilities.
the
government
has
continued
throughout
this
case
to
try
to
ignore
the
recreational
context
in
which
these
claims
arises.
for
instance,
here
this
morning
we
asked
about
cases,
different
cases,
and
about
the
consistency
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinions.
there's
two
cases,
only
two,
that
have
even
sort
of
addressed
it.
that
was
the
hayes
case
and
the
morici
case,
and
their
recreation
was
involved
to
the
extent
that
the
discharge
of
the
water
in
both
cases
was
for
recreational
purposes,
and
they
got
different
results.
the
hayes
case
says
the
plaintiff
can
recover
when
the
discharge
is
solely
for
recreational
cases,
and
the
morici
case
says
the
plaintiff
can't
recover.
so
when
you...
that's
the
only
two
cases
that
really
ever
addressed
in
any
way
the
recreational
aspect.
mr.
t.
john
ward
well,
there
is
now,
your
honor,
but
that
was
not
true
in
1928.
that
was
not
even
considered
in
1928,
and
no
where
in
the
legislative
history.
the
first
time
that
i
have
been
able
to
find
that
the
government
was
into...
interested
in
or
authorized
to
take
on
recreational
activity
at
flood
control
projects
was
in
1946,
and
i
believe
that's
codified
in
16
u.s.
code
460(d).
so
that
was
just
not
a
consideration.
but
it
is
true
that
in
most
flood
control
projects,
they
have
now
taken
on
the
management
of
recreational
facilities
as
a
separate
and
distinct
function
for
fundamentally
different
purposes
than
flood
control.
mr.
t.
john
ward
well,
the
recreational
use
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
flood
waters.
mr.
t.
john
ward
to
that
extent,
yes,
sir,
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
t.
john
ward
well,
they
have
a
common
place,
that
is
true,
your
honor,
that
they
conduct...
they
conduct
both
activities
at
the
same
premises,
that
is--
mr.
t.
john
ward
--i
agree,
yes,
sir.
we
rely
on
the
district
court's
findings
of
fact
which
in
summary
is
they
find
that
the
government
recognized
that
it
had
a
duty
to
provide
for
the
safety
of
recreational
users,
it
recognized
that
this
duty
was
continuing,
even
though
they
were
in
flood
control,
they
recognized
that
specifically,
and
the
findings
of
fact
specifically
recognize
that
the
government
had
installed
a
system
of
buoys
to
warn
of
the
danger
of
the
discharge
structure,
and
on
the
date
of
the
accident,
only
one
of
the
buoys
was
anywhere
close
to
being
where
it
should
have
been,
and
it
did
not
provide
any
warning
to
a
prudent
recreational
user.
the
purpose
of
these
buoys
had
nothing
to
do
with
flood
control.
the
government
had
voluntarily
elected
to
engage
in
the
establish...
establishment,
establishment
and
management
of
recreational
activities,
and
this
was
a
fundamentally
different
activity
from
flood
control.
the
government
made
this
decision
to
install
the
system
of
buoys.
the
system's
only
purpose
was
for
the
warning
of
recreational
users.
the
government
encouraged
the
use
of
these
facilities
by
recreational
users,
and
we
urge
that
702(c)
have
a
more
narrower
interpretation
than
this
broad,
sweeping
interpretation
that
the
government
is
urging
this
court
to
adopt
in
the
recreational
context.
mr.
t.
john
ward
if
that's
all
we
looked
at,
i
would
agree,
your
honor.
mr.
t.
john
ward
i
suggest
to
your
honor
that
if
you
look
at
the
situation
such
as
justice
o'connor
described,
that
at
that
time
that
the
government
enjoyed
complete
immunity
from
tort
claims,
then
the
statute
in
effect
is
rendered
meaningless
at
the
time
of
its
enactment.
it's
superfluous.
that
violates
some
principles
of
statutory
construction
that
you
never
presume
that
congress
puts
meaningless
language
in
a
statute.
it
would
have
had
no
meaning.
it
would
have
laid
there
dormant
from
1928
until
1946
when
we
acted...
enacted
the
tort
claims
act,
and
suddenly,
by
the
breathing
of
life,
if
you
will,
through
the
tort
claims
act
in
this
dormant
provision,
and
i
am
suggesting
that
they
should
be
read
consistently
and
that
we
should
give
consideration
to
the
congressionally
declared
policy
in
the
tort
claims
act
that
the
government
will
be
liable
for
its
negligence
the
same
as
an
ordinary
person
would.
mr.
t.
john
ward
no,
no,
your
honor.
i
am
not
saying
that.
i
am
saying
that
because
of
the
fact
that
the
statute
was
superfluous,
because
of
the
fact
that
it
had
no
meaning
until
you
enacted
the
tort
claims
act,
and
the
fact
that
the
government
had
been
engaging
in
activities
which
would
create
a
risk
up
until
the
time
of
the
tort
claims
act
that
they
never
saw
fit
to
codify,
that
you
should
look
behind
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
for
those
reasons,
and
when
you
look
behind
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute,
i
think
you
will
see
what
congress'
intent
was,
and
it
did
not
consider
that.
we
will
get
into
that
in
our
second
point.
but
the
third
reason
that
i
believe
that
we
have
to
limit
the
application
of
this
statute
and
its
breadth
is
that
we
are
talking
about
an
immunity
statute,
and
the
fundamental
principle
of
immunity
doctrine
is
that
you
never
extend
it
beyond
its
justifying
purposes.
mr.
t.
john
ward
cases
that
we
have
cited
there
in
our
brief.
mr.
t.
john
ward
nixon
v.
fitzgerald.
mr.
t.
john
ward
no,
no,
your
honor,
but
i
believe
it
still
stands
for
the
proposition
that
in
any
immunity
doctrine,
you're
still
talking
about
the
function.
you're
talking
about
in
this
case
whether
or
not
you
will
extend
the
immunity
to
a
fundamentally
different
function
than
flood
control,
that
is,
the
function
of
recreational
management,
and
in
those
cases
that
we
cite
in
our
briefs
dealing
with
immunity,
you
are
still
talking
about
whether
or
not
it
should
extend
past
the
function
that
was
intended
and
it
was
justified
for
in
its
enactment,
whether
it
be
by
statute
or
whether
it
be
by
the
constitution
in
the
case
of
the
speech
and
debate
clause.
we
don't
believe
there's
any
justification
for
extending
702(c)
immunity
to
an
activity
that
is
unrelated
to
flood
control,
particularly
where
it
didn't
engage
in
the
activity,
it
wasn't
authorized
by
statute
until
1946,
and
when
the
government
voluntarily
elects
to
engage
in
an
activity
such
as
the
management
of
recreational
facilities
and
affirmatively
encourages
their
use,
an
extension
of
immunity
to
those
areas
would
in
no
way
enhance
flood
control
or
encourage
the
government
to
engage
in
flood
control.
having
made
the
decision,
and
having
physically
installed
these
warning
buoys
as
a
system,
we
believe
that
the
government
had
a
clear
duty
to
maintain
these
buoys
in
a
non-negligent
manner.
this
has
been
the
rule
for
over
30
years
since
this
court
announced
its
decision
in
indian
towing
v.
united
states.
we
believe
that
when
you
look
at
the
statutory
history,
you
will
see
that
there
was
no
consideration
given
to
recreational
use
of
flood
control
activities,
there
is
nothing
in
there
that
would
suggest
that
the
government
considered
recreational
use
at
the
time,
and
clearly,
to
say
that
you
are
going
to
extend
immunity
to
whatever
happens
on
a
recreational
reservoir
or
on
a
reservoir
for
flood
control
activities,
we
believe
that
that
overstates
the
scope
of
the
immunity,
the
permissible
scope
of
immunity.
in
our
brief
we
offered
you
two
examples,
that
702(c)
should
not
extend
to
the
government's
negligence
in
the
management
of
toxic
waste.
if
you
are
going...
if
the
government
does
that
and
then
by
reason
of
its
negligence
these
toxic
wastes
get
into
the
flood
waters,
with
the
breadth
and
scope
that
the
government
tries
to
say
that
we
ought
to
apply,
there
would
be
no...
there
would
be
total
immunity
for
that.
if
they
elect
to
go
out
there
on
this
same
reservoir
and
establish
a
ferry
service
and
are
negligent
in
the
operation
of
that
ferry,
the
government
says
that
if
the
person
drowns
out
there
on
the
lake,
that
is
flood
waters,
you
can't
recover.
we
believe
that
those
examples
indicate
that
this
particular
immunity
provision
should
be
construed
more
narrowly.
we
just
believe
it's
inconceivable
that
congress
could
have
intended
the
statutory
immunity
intended
for
flood
control
activity
to
be
expanded
in
the
fashion
urged
by
the
government,
so
that
it
should
not
be
expanded
to
cover
fundamentally
different
activities
undertaken
by
the
government
for
fundamentally
different
reasons.
mr.
t.
john
ward
i
do
not
believe
it
could
have,
your
honor.
mr.
t.
john
ward
i
say
i
don't
believe
that
it
could
have
been
more
expansive,
i
agree
to
that--
mr.
t.
john
ward
--if--
mr.
t.
john
ward
--that
is
the
language
of
the
statute
without
going
further,
yes,
your
honor,
and
we
are
suggesting
though
for
other
reasons
that
the
scope
of
the
immunity
should
be
more
narrowly
construed.
just
as
a
prosecutor
loses
his
immunity
when
he
engages
in
an
administrative
activity
or
an
investigative
activity,
so
should
a
government
agency
lose
702(c)
immunity
when
it
elects
to
engage
in
the
management
of
recreational
facilities
unrelated
to
flood
control.
to
some
extent,
the
government
appears
to
contend
in
the
reply
brief
that
our
examples
are
too
far
removed
from
the
situation
of
recreational
management
and
that
it's
fundamentally
different
from
flood
control.
but
we
suggest
to
you
if
you
look
at
the
example
if
the
ferry,
that
they
are
saying
that
they
would
be
liable
for
the
negligent
operation
of
the
ferry,
the
danger
that
the
ferry
operator
had
to
navigate
around
was
caused
under
that
example
by
the
discharge
of
flood
waters.
so
we
think
that
it
is
very
analogous,
it
is
just
as...
that
the
same
principle
should
apply
as
to
that
situation
as
to
the
recreational
users
in
the
instant
case.
clearly,
we
believe
that
the
trial
court's
findings
conclusively
establish
that
the
government
was
negligent
in
the
management
of
recreational
facilities
by
failing
to
maintain
the
buoy
warning
system
which
it
had
elected
to
install
but
which
the
buoys
themselves
were
in
no
way
related
to
flood
control.
the
only
common
factor,
as
i
mention,
is
the
location
of
the
premises,
and
this
is
not
different
than
a
lot
of
tort
cases
where
you
have
two
actors.
in
effect,
the
government
is
out
there
doing
two
different,
totally
unrelated
functions.
when
you
start
analyzing
it
in
terms
of
traditional
tort
concepts,
i
don't
see
any
reason
that
we
should
extend
immunity
to
such
fundamentally
different
activities.
mr.
t.
john
ward
they
found
that
one
of--
mr.
t.
john
ward
--that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor,
and--
mr.
t.
john
ward
--they
also
found
that
the
negligence
in
failing
to
maintain
the
buoys
was
a
proximate
cause
of
the
injuries
as
well.
we
suggest
that
the
appropriate
analysis
for
the
court
is
to
provide
that
as
a
question
of
law,
a
threshold
question
would
be
asked
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
government
had
engaged
in
activity
other
than
flood
control
which
was
a
"but
for"
cause
of
the
plaintiff's
damages.
if
so,
then
the
case
would
be
tried
to
the
trier
of
fact
on
traditional
tort
principles.
this
approach,
contrary
to
what
the
solicitor
argues,
would
provide
the
government
with
a
great
deal
of
protection.
in
virtually
all
of
the
court
of
appeals
cases
that
have
been
reported,
the
result
would
be
the
same,
and
the
government
has
been
winning
all
of
those
cases.
so
i
think
it
is
inconsistent
to
say
that,
in
their
brief,
that
well,
we
are
going
to
open
up
this
flood
gate
of
claims
because
with
this
approach,
you
wouldn't.
you
would
have
the
same
result
in
virtually
all
of
the
cases.
and
additionally,
the
government
would
still
have
the
discretionary
function
exemption
available
to
it
under
the
tort
claims
act.
turning
to
our
other
point,
we
believe
that
702(c)
was
clearly
intended
not
to
immunize
the
government
against
tort
claims
from
which
it
is
already
immune,
but
rather,
to
deal
with
special
problems
created
by
congress
to
compensate
certain
property
owners
from
flood
damage.
we
know
that
when
you
have
got
any
statutory
construction,
you
have
got
to
look
at
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute.
we
have
already
talked
about
the
fact
that
it
was
superfluous
at
the
time
it
was
enacted.
secondly,
if
you
say
we
are
going
to
apply
this
literal
meaning
rule
in
this
case,
you
are
going
to
have
to
have
an
exception.
you
are
going
to
have
to
say
we
will
apply
the
literal
meaning
of
702(c)
except
in
the
event
of
constitutional
takings
because
that
would
render
the
statute
unconstitutional.
and
then
the
additional
reason
that
we
have
mentioned,
that
is,
the
statute
would
have
had
no
meaning,
the
tort
claims
act
is
what
gave
it
life,
i
think
we
should
consider
the
policy
as
announced
by
congress
and
the
fact
that
there
were...
the
government
had
been
engaging
up
until
the
time
of
the
tort
claims
act
in
many
activities
which
presented
great
risk,
but
at
no
time
did
the
government
see
fit
to
codify
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity.
now,
what
was
significant
about
this
statute
is
the
fact
that
for
the
first
time,
the
government
was
agreeing
to
compensate
property
owners
along
the
mississippi
in
two
situations,
for
damages
that
did
not
rise
to
the
level
of
a
taking;
that
is
the
proviso
section
of
702(c);
and
702(d)
damages.
now,
the
way
that
statute
arose,
this
was
the
first
time
that
i
found
where
the
government
ever
agreed
to
pay
for
anything
other
than
what
the
constitution
required
in
these
type
of
cases.
so
congress
was
very
concerned,
and
these
statutes,
the
702(c)
proviso
and
the
702(d)
damages,
came
about
as
a
result
of
a
classic
case
of
congressional
compromise,
if
you
will.
on
the
one
hand,
you
had
the
very
generous
provision
that
the
senate
had
enacted
in
senate
bill
3740
where
they
said
that...
it
was
overly
generous.
they
were
going
to
just
pay
for
all
sorts
of
property
damages,
and
one
of
the
things
that...
in
addition
to
the
constitutional
takings,
and
additionally,
they
were
going
to
pay
for
relocating
railroads,
and
that
brought
about
considerable
concern
in
the
house.
now,
the
senate
provision
was
modified
in
the
house
before
the
debate,
so
it
came
to
the
floor
of
the
house
where
the
actual
debate
took
place,
with
the
senate's
version
on
the
one
hand
and
the
administration,
the
coolidge
administration
on
the
other,
which
basically
said
we
want
to
pay
for
constitutional
takings
and
not
a
dime
more.
so
what
came
about
was
702(c)
and
702(d),
with
both
sides
giving
some.
and
702(c)
was
enacted
as
a
part
of
these
package
of
amendments.
and
in
those
debates
there
is
no...
never
an
expression
of
concern
about
tort
liability.
the
only
concern
was
about
claims
that
might
arise
under
the
overly
generous
provision
of
the
senate
bill
where
they
were
concerned
about
the
fact
that
they
were
going
to
be
75
an
acre
for
lands
that
were
only
worth
$5
an
acre.
that's
what
all
of
that
congressional
debate.
now,
they
can
take
a
word
out
of
context,
or
one
sentence,
but
when
you
read
the
entire
congressional
debate
between
april
17
and
about
april
24th,
it
becomes
abundantly
clear
that
that
was
never
really
considered
in
those
debates;
tort
liability
just
didn't
come
up.
the
one
or
two
times
that
it
was
mentioned
was
that,
well,
we
know
the
government
is
not
liable
for
consequential
damages,
just
very
limited
mentioning,
and
then
when
it
was
mentioned,
it
was
always
with
the
affirmative
statement
that
we
enjoy
complete
immunity.
what
we
believe
that
702(c)
did
was
it
answered
the
administration's
concern
and
some
concerns
in
the
house
that
they
would
not...
that
the
extra
damages
over
and
above
constitutional
takings
would
be
limited
to
those
specific
situations
described
in
the
702(c)
proviso,
that
is,
the
situation
where
the
damages
occur
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
from
where
levies
are
built
if
you
can't
build
them
on
both
sides,
and
then
the
intentional
diversion
of
the
stream
in
702(d).
and
additionally,
they
were
saying
that
the
condemnation
provision
and
procedure
set
forth
in
702(d)
would
be
the
only
remedy,
thereby
that
was
where
you
would
have
three
commissioners,
and
their
award
would
be
final,
and
thereby
allaying
the
fears
about
all
these
judicial
claims
and
these
local
juries.
there
would
be
no
judicial
entitlement
or
enforcement
of
702(c)
proviso
damages
or
702(d)
damages.
in
conclusion,
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
statements
in
the
government's
brief
about
the
fact
that
they
have
over
9,000
of
these
projects.
now,
surely,
as
they
have
over
9,000
projects,
i
think
it's
clear
that
they
have
from
the
same
statistics
that
are
available
and
known,
is
that
they
have
visitors
in
the
recreational
use
of
over
millions
of
people
to
these
projects,
and
i
think
it's
clear
and
we
can
assume
that...
and
every
time
you've
got
a
flood
control
project,
you've
got
to
have
a
discharge
of
waters,
and
that
the
government
has
elected
i'm
sure
in
most
instances
to
install
some
type
of
warning
system
for
any
dangers.
now,
then,
the
extreme
position
that
the
government
urges
upon
this
court
is
that
it
would
enjoy
total
immunity
for
its
failure
to
maintain
those
warning
systems
that
it
has
elected
to
install,
that
it
would
expose
all,
every
citizen
that
visited
this
recreational
facility
under
the
exclusive
control
and
management
of
the
government
to
being
injured
or
killed
from
the
government's
negligence
or
worse
such
as
we
have
in
the
butler
case.
we
believe
that
the
court
should
reject
this
contention
because
it's
contrary
to
the
congressionally
declared
policy
as
set
forth
in
the
tort
claim
act;
it's
contrary
to
the
fundamental
principles
of
immunity
doctrine
that
should
be
limited
to
its
justifying
purposes;
and
it's
contrary
to
the
actual
congressional
intent
expressed
by
congress
in
the
legislative
debates
when
it
enacted
702(c).
thank
you
very
much.
