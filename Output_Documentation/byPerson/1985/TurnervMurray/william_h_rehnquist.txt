justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
snook,
in
your
submission
a
moment
ago
you
said
that
in
your
view
the
court
could
retain,
i
thought
you
said,
the
basic
outline
of
ristaino
against
ross,
which
leaves
it
largely
to
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court
informed
by
the
facts
of
the
particular
case.
but
you
are
not
suggesting
under
your
rule
that
a
trial
judge
in
virginia
in
this
case
could
have
exercised
his
discretion
as
this
particular
trial
judge
did,
could
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
was
this
case
tried,
what
county?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
southampton
county
is
a
good
ways
from
northhampton
county?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
your
submission
is
on
your
narrowest
ground
that
although
the
judge
had
resided
in
northhampton
county,
he
could
have
declined
to
voir
dire;
since
he
came
from
another
county,
he
couldn't
have.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
crow
likes
to
follow
the
shoreline.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
would
you
require
him
to
put
something
on
the
record
reciting
that
he
had
considered
them?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
require
it
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
kulp,
the
supreme
court
of
virginia's
opinion
when
it
is
dealing
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
trial
judge
should
have
asked
this
question
does
have
a
footnote,
as
i
recall,
saying
that
the
defendant
had
introduced
into
evidence
this
study.
it
doesn't
say
when
it
was
introduced.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
ask
you
for
a
minute,
mr.
kulp,
is
the
first
study
you
referred
to
the
northeastern
study?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
bowers
and
pierce.
that
was
offered
in
the
trial
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
were
bowers
and
pierce,
either
of
them
present?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
state
object
to
the
admission?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
trial
judge
received
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
post-sentencing
proceeding?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
then
how
about
the
morrow
study?
you
say
that
was
introduced
for
the
first
time
in
the
federal
habeas
proceeding?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
was
the
state's
position
when
that
was
offered?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
who
did
mr.
woodard
represent?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
does
that
mean,
to
say
they
would
have
gone
forward?
forward
to
what?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
else
perhaps
he
was
referring
to
the
supreme
court
of
virginia.
