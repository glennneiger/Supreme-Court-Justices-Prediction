justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
were
there
blacks
on
the
jury
that
convicted
this
man?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
who
was
the
foreman?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
qualified
your
answer
to
justice
white
by
saying
there
isn't
much
doubt
of
his
guilt.
there
is
none
whatever,
is
there?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
fact
of
guilt
doesn't
necessarily
answer
your
constitutional
question,
but--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--and
you
client
also
tried
to
kill
another
person
at
the
same
time.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
he
shot
one
person
who
didn't
die.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
are
you
sure
of
that?
you
know
the
record
better
than
i
do.
