mr.
james
e.
kulp
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
supreme
court,
may
it
please
the
court,
one
of
the
questions
that
was
asked
earlier
about
the
difference
between
southampton
county,
the
place
in
which
this
crime
occurred,
and
northampton
county,
the
place
in
which
the
trial
occurred,
in
his
opening
statement
to
the
jury
counsel
for
petitioner,
in
speaking
to
the
jurors
in
northampton
county,
indicated
that
the
area
and
the
people
were
basically
the
same.
you
find
this
on
the
transcript
of
trial,
december
the
4th,
page
116.
i
think
that
the
question
that
counsel
for
petitioner
is
asking
is,
since
the
judge
was
not
from
this
county,
therefore
he
had
a
special
duty
to
determine
whether
racial
prejudice
existed
in
this
particular
instance.
this
court
has
said
on
many
occasions
that
the
trial
judge
has
great
discretion,
broad
discretion
to
determine
the
voir
dire
in
a
case,
and
it
seems
that
this
court
has
indicated
that
in
order
for
the
judge
to
exercise
his
discretion,
that
counsel
need
to
inform
him
or
bring
to
his
attention
those
matters
in
which
they
believe
that,
particularly
in
this
instance,
where
they
are
requesting
a
specific
question,
the
matters
which
they
think
they
should
call
to
the
judge's
attention
to
require
such
a
question.
now,
the
situation
in
this
case
is
that
prior
to
trial
over
in
northampton
county
the
petitioner's
attorneys
did
make
a
motion
to
strike
the
indictment
because
of
the
fact
under
their
position
that
the
statutes
in
virginia
were
unconstitutional.
they
did
mention
to
the
judge
at
that
time
a
study
from
northeastern
university,
but
the
record
makes
clear
they
did
not
introduce
the
study
at
that
time.
the
study
was
not
actually
introduced
into
the
record
until
the
post-sentencing
hearing
several
months
after
the
conviction
and
sentencing
by
the
jury
in
this
case.
several
things
occurred
in
between
the
time
that
the
mention
of
this
study
and
the
question
about
voir
dire
occurred.
prior
to
trial,
the
judge
had
requested
counsel
to
supply
him
with
questions
which
they
would
ask
that
he
ask
the
jury.
they
did
so.
one
of
the
questions
was,
as
mr.
snook
has
indicated,
a
question
specifically
related
to
a
question
towards
possible
racial
bias.
during
the
trial,
when
the
judge
was
taking
up
the
questions,
the
prosecutor
brought
to
the
judge's
attention,
said
that
this
was
not
a
racial
case,
it
did
not
involve
any
racial
issues,
and
that
the
only
thing
you
had
here
was
a
crime
where
the
victim
was
white
and
the
defendant
was
black.
at
that
time
the
petitioner's
attorney
made
no
proffer
to
the
court
of
any
reasons
why
the
question
should
be
asked.
they
did
not
again
bring
to
the
judge's
attention
the
northeastern
study
or
their
basis
that
the
question
should
be
asked
because
in
their
view
the
study
shows
that
white
victims...
defendants
who
kill
white
victims
are
more
frequently
subject
to
the
death
penalty.
they
didn't
tell
him
anything
about,
judge,
you
are
not
familiar
with
this
county
so
therefore
you
need
to
give
specific
attention
to
whether
you
know
anything
about
the
county.
they
didn't
bring
to
his
attention
the
things
that
they
had
mentioned
in
their
brief.
they
set
forth
a
number
of
factors.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
yes,
sir,
justice
rehnquist,
they
do,
and
it
seems
that
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
has
given
credit
that
the
study
was
introduced
on
this
particular
point.
i
suggest
to
the
court,
however,
that
a
careful
reading
of
the
record
would
indicate
that
it
was
not,
and
then
if
the
court
would
look
at
the
post-sentencing
bearing
when
the
study
actually
was
introduced
into
evidence
in
february
of
1980,
at
that
point
the
attorneys
for
the
defendant
again
said,
we
want
to
now
make
a
part
of
the
record
the
study
from
northeastern
as
it
pertains
to
our
claim
of
discrimination
application
of
the
statute.
they
didn't
really
say
again
that
it
was
for
this
point,
but
even
if
you
give
credit,
as
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
has
apparently
done,
to
the
defendant
for
introducing
this
study
on
the
basis
of
showing
that
white
victims,
defendants
who
kill
white
victims
are
more
frequently
executed,
we
submit
that
the
study
is
insufficient.
first
of
all,
the
bowers
and
pierce
study
that
was
introduced
at
trial
bore
no
relationship
to
how
the
death
penalty
is
being
imposed
in
the
state
of
virginia.
it
was
based
on
some
statistics
in
five
other
states.
now,
we
submit
that
at
the
time
this
court
decided
furman,
all
states
were
basically
operating
the
same.
but
since
this
court
handed
down
the
decisions
in
gregg,
jurek,
and
proffitt,
states
do
not
have
the
same
type
of
statutes
any
longer,
and
virginia,
we
submit,
has
one
of
the
more
stringent
statutes
in
the
country,
because
not
only
has
virginia
seen
fit
to
narrow
the
categories
on
crimes
for
which
a
death
penalty
may
be
imposed,
and
it
is
related
to
all
of
the
capital
murder
crimes,
had
to
be
wilful,
premeditated,
and
deliberate
murders.
in
virginia,
unlike
texas
and
florida
and
georgia,
virginia
cannot
use
a
felony
murder
rule
in
capital
cases.
in
addition
to
having
to
show
the
premeditation
and
wilful,
deliberate
murder,
it
has
to
be
in
connection
with
some
other
aggravating
circumstance
such
as
during
the
commission
of
rape
or
in
this
case
during
the
commission
of
armed
robbery.
but
not
only
does
the
commonwealth
bear
the
burden
of
showing
those
stringent
circumstances.
a
person
is
not
eligible
to
be
subject
to
the
death
penalty
in
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
unless
the
commonwealth
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
one
of
two
additional
aggravating
circumstances.
so,
we
submit
that
the
statute
in
virginia
is
much
more
stringent
than
the
statutes
in
other
states,
and
that
virginia
should
be
viewed
upon
how
it
is
imposing
capital
murder,
not
perhaps
what
they
are
doing
in
georgia
or
some
other
place.
the
studies,
as
we
have
indicated
in
our
brief,
are
clearly
fundamentally
flawed.
each
of
the
studies,
the
bowers
and
pierce
study,
which
was
introduced
at
the
time
of
trial,
and
the
study
by
gross
and
morrow
which
was
introduced,
i
think,
during
the
federal
district
court
proceeding
on
a
motion
to
alter
or
amend,
those
studies
take
all
homicides
committed
in
a
state
and
try
to
compare
those
with
cases
in
which
the
death
sentence
was
actually
imposed.
under
virginia
law,
for
example,
they
are
comparing
or
would
try
to
be
comparing
in
gross
and
morrow's
study,
they
would
be
trying
to
compare
capital
murder
cases
with
manslaughter
cases,
with
second
degree
murder
cases,
with
first
degree
murder
cases,
all
of
those
of
which
the
defendant
is
never
subject
to
capital
punishment.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
yes,
sir,
that
is
bowers
and
pierce.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
no,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
no,
sir,
the
commonwealth's
attorney
did
not
object.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
yes,
sir.
i
wanted
to
point
out
that
they
mentioned
the
study
to
the
judge
at
that
time.
they
did
not
in
fact
introduce
the
study
until
after
the
trial
in
the
post-sentencing
conviction
or
proceeding.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
proceeding.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
i
think
the
position,
and
i
didn't
try
the
case,
but
i
believe
the
position
was
that
it
does
not
accurately
reflect
how
capital
punishment
is
raised
or
is
being
imposed
in
the
commonwealth
of
virginia,
and
the
district
court
found
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
statistics
were
not
acceptable.
we
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
this
case
is
guided
by
the
principles
enunciated
by
the
court
in
ristaino
versus
ross.
in
that
case,
this
court
said
that
simply
having
a
black
defendant
and
a
white
victim
is
not
a
special
circumstance
to
warrant
the
specific
inquiry
into
possible
racial
prejudice.
and
we
submit
that
in
this
case,
the
judge
did
what
he
is
constitutionally
required
to
do.
at
a
time
when
all
the
veniremen
were
present,
the
defendant,
who
is
black,
stood
at
the
time
the
indictment
was
read
and
requested
trial
by
jury,
so
when
all
of
the
veniremen
knew
the
race
of
the
defendant,
the
judge
then
asked
two
questions.
do
any
of
you
know
any
reason
whatsoever
why
you
cannot
render
a
fair
and
impartial
verdict
in
these
cases
either
for
the
defendant
or
for
the
commonwealth
of
virginia?
the
second
question
the
judge
asked
the
veniremen,
do
any
of
you
know
why
you
cannot
render
an
impartial
verdict
in
this
case?
now,
we
submit
that
those
questions,
absent
the
special
circumstance
as
noted
by
this
court
in
ham
versus
south
carolina,
is
all
that
is
mandated
under
constitutional
law.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
justice
o'connor,
it
is
true
that
in
this
case
the
jury
when
they
were
asked
these
questions
did
not
know
the
race
of
the
defendant...
or
the
victim,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
all
during
the
case
neither
the
prosecutor
nor
the
defendant
ever
made
anything
of
race
either
of
the
defendant
or
the
victim,
and
it
wasn't
until
about
the
second
or
third
day
of
trial
when
the
prosecutor
introduced
a
photograph
of
the
body
that
the
jurors
virtually
became
aware
that
he
was
white.
so,
there
was
never
any
issue
made
to
the
jury
by
the
prosecutor
or
even
in
the
defendant's
case
that
he
was
white.
now,
it
seems
that
in
ristaino,
when
the
general
question
was
asked,
one
of
the
jurors
was
excused
because
he
admitted
to
racial
bias,
and
we
submit
that
this
is
certainly
a
clear
indication
that
when
they
know
the
race
of
the
defendant,
that
is
where
the
bias,
if
any
there
is,
would
come
into
play,
and
since
in
ristaino
one
of
the
jurors
admitted
to
racial
bias,
we
think
that
the
general
question
then
would
draw
out
from
a
juror
who
is
going
to
be
honest,
and
we
submit
that
the
asking
of
the
additional
question...
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
that
a
juror,
if
they
were
harboring
racial
bias
and
they
were
asked
the
normal
questions
and
they
didn't
answer
in
the
affirmative,
there
is
nothing
to
really
indicate
that
they
would
answer
any
more
truthfully
to
a
more
pointed
question.
now,
the
fact
that
it
is
a
capital
case,
of
course,
in
virginia,
as
i
have
indicated,
the
jury
must
find
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
one
of
two
aggravating
circumstances.
this
is,
it
appears
to
me,
much
like
in
the
trial
itself.
in
other
words,
there
are
certain
factual
issues
that
a
jury
must
focus
upon
in
order
to
find
that
a
person
is
subject
to
capital
punishment.
now,
this
court
in
the
past,
while
it
has
recognized
the
qualitative
different
nature
of
death
sentences,
has
never
gone
and
taken
the
step
of
carving
out
a
separate
and
distinct
series
of
laws
to
apply
to
capital
cases.
for
example,
in
barefoot
versus
estelle,
this
court
said
that
there
is
no
reason
not
to
apply
the
normal
rules
of
evidence
as
to
using
an
expert.
the
court
applies
the
same
standard
in
capital
and
noncapital
cases
in
strickland
versus
washington,
when
you
deal
with
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
and
in
wainwright
versus
witt
the
court
said
that
the
excusing
for
causing
of
jurors
is
the
same,
that
you
apply
the
same
standard
whether
you
are
talking
about
a
capital
case
or
a
noncapital
case.
and
we
submit
that
there
have
been
no
persuasive
reasons
presented
to
this
court
which
would
justify
a
step
as
saying
that
simply
because
it
is
a
capital
case,
that
therefore
you
should
ask
different
questions.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
no,
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
no,
your
honor.
we
would
say
that
he
did
in
fact
on
the
record
exercise
his
discretion.
when
the
question
was
presented
to
him,
the
prosecutor
said,
your
honor,
this
is
not
a
racial
case,
there
is
nothing
racially
involved,
and
the
record
will
show
that
the
petitioner
has
conceded
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
that
would
indicate
any
racial
animosity.
and
so
the
prosecutor
said,
your
honor,
this
is
not
a
racial
case.
all
we
have
is
a
black
defendant
and
a
white
victim.
now,
the
defendant,
his
attorneys
did
not
offer
anything
to
the
judge
to
the
contrary,
and
the
judge
indicated,
well,
the
supreme
court
has
already
ruled
on
that.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
he
could
have.
if
we
take
the
things
that
they
have
presented,
first
they
said
that
because
you
have
different
races.
well,
this
court
has
already
said
in
ristaino
that
is
not
a
special
circumstance.
they
indicated
that
there
is
a
past
history
of
racial
discrimination,
and
we
submit
that
there
is
no
indication
in
this
case,
there
is
no
indication
that
under
the
new
capital
punishment
laws
in
virginia
that
there
is
any
racial
discrimination
in
the
imposition
of
capital
punishment
in
virginia.
they
talk
about
there
are
only
four
peremptory
strikes.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
yes,
your
honor,
because
even
though
they
have
introduced--
mr.
james
e.
kulp
--yes,
ma'am.
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
court
has
recognized
in
rosales
that
under
its
supervisory
authority,
that
the
court
has
closer
supervision
in
the
federal
courts.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
well,
justice
white,
i
think
to
answer
your
question
if
you
have
a
special
circumstance,
as
was--
mr.
james
e.
kulp
--i
think,
justice
white,
that
the
court
did
not
find
that
that
was
a
reasonable
possibility
apparently
in
all
circumstances,
because
in
ristaino
you
had
a
violent
crime,
blacks
on
white,
and
the
court
said
that
does
not
call
for
a
per
se
rule,
and
so
it
seems
to
me
that
what
the
court
has
done
in
rosales
is
applied
its
supervisory
authority,
but
they
said--
mr.
james
e.
kulp
--yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
it
is.
it
could
not
stand,
ristaino
could
not
stand
on
that
basis
because
it
was...
in
that
case
it
was--
mr.
james
e.
kulp
--ristaino
came
first.
rosales
made
clear,
justice
white,
that
the
court
was
not
overturning
ristaino,
but
was
simply
using
its
authority
in
a
supervisory
role.
and
in
this
case,
the
facts
of
the
case
clearly
show
that
there
was
no
contest
as
to
the
guilt
in
this
case.
the
defendant's
attorneys
when
they
were
arguing
to
the
jury
clearly
told
the
jury
this
case
has
never
been
about
guilt
or
innocence.
in
fact,
there
is
overwhelming
evidence
of
his
guilt.
one
looks
at
the
circumstances
and
aggravation,
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
said
that
his
past
record
is
perhaps
the
worst
they
had
seen
up
until
that
time.
it
had
a
prior
murder
conviction,
and
within
a
period
of
four
years
he
had
three
other
malicious
wounding
cases,
and
so
the
court,
even,
justice
white,
in
rosales,
the
court
said
that
even
if
the
judge
failed
to
honor
the
defendant's
request,
it
will
not
be
reversible
error
where
the
circumstances
of
the
case
indicate
that
there
is
a
reasonable
possibility
that
racial
prejudice
might
have
influenced
the
jury,
in
other
words,
if
there
is
no
possibility
that
it
influenced
the
jury.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
well,
i
think
the
petitioner's
relief
asked
for
in
both
his
petition
or
in
his
initial
brief
and
the
reply
brief
talks
in
terms
of
both,
either
send
it
back
for
a
retrial
entirely
or
send
it
back
for
sentencing.
it
certainly
seems
to
me
that
in
this
case
there
is
absolutely
no
question
about
the
guilt.
the
case...
the
defendant
was
found
in
the
store.
we
had
four
eye
witnesses.
there
has
never
been
any
question
as
to
his
guilt.
and
his
counsel
so
admitted
to
the
jurors
at
the
sentencing
phase.
so,
i
am
not
sure
what
he
is
asking
for,
justice
white,
but
he
has
seemed
to
ask
in
both
terms.
so
we
would
ask
this
court
not
to
overrule
ristaino.
in
fact,
petitioner
is
not
asking
the
court
to
do
that.
and
we
believe
that
if
significant
studies
were
produced
which
in
fact
judged
how
capital
punishment
were
being
imposed
in
virginia,
and
they
showed
some
discriminatory
effect,
then
we
believe
that
certainly
would
be
taken
into
consideration
by
the
trial
judge
as
a
special
circumstance.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
justice
marshall--
mr.
james
e.
kulp
--justice
marshall,
i
don't
think
he
closed
his
mind.
i
don't
think
that
counsel
ever
presented
the--
mr.
james
e.
kulp
--he
said
that,
yes,
sir,
but
the
attorneys
did
not--
mr.
james
e.
kulp
--it
was
not
there.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
well,
i
assume,
but
i
think
that
the
judge
is
like
anyone
else.
he
has
to
exercise
his
discretion,
and
the
duty
on
counsel
is
to
bring
these
things
to
his
attention.
they
did
not
bring
these
matters
that
they
are
now
relying
on
to
his
attention,
and
we
submit
that
there
was
nothing
in
this
case
over
which
the
judge
abused
his
discretion.
he
was
simply
following
what
i
believe
was
the
law
which
was
set
down
by
this
court
in
ristaino
only
three
years
before
he
ruled
in
this
case.
and
we
would
ask
the
court
in
this...
for
example,
the
death
penalty
in
virginia
has
only
been
under
the
new
statute
since
1977,
and
between
1977
and
1985,
june
of
1985,
there
have
only
been
212
people
charged
with
capital
murder
in
the
state
of
virginia.
the
petitioner
indicates
in
his
petition
that
there
are
32
people
on
death
row
in
virginia,
which
would
leave
us
then
180
people
who
have
been
charged
with
capital
murder
who
have
had
some
disposition
other
than
the
death
sentence.
so,
if
we
take
half
of
those
and
consider
that
half
of
those
180
are
black
and
half
of
those
180--
mr.
james
e.
kulp
--yes,
justice
white,
there
is,
but
these
were
212
people
actually
indicated
for
capital
murder.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
well,
i
think
at
least
certainly
initially,
justice
white,
but
we
obviously
know
some
people
were
convicted
of
lesser
offenses.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
so
he
at
least
charged
him.
in
other
words,
these
were
not
the
situation
where
he
had
already
exercised
his
discretion
in
order
to
bring
the
charge,
but
we
are
not
talking
about
people
where
the
prosecutor
did
not
ever
exercise
discretion
or
assume
to
begin
with
that
he
would
not
make
the
charge.
so
i
am
simply
suggesting
that--
mr.
james
e.
kulp
--justice
stevens,
we
know
by
a
survey
that
we
did
that
more
blacks
who
killed
whites
who
were
convicted
of
capital
murder
received
life
imprisonment
than
they
did
the
death
sentence.
and
that
is
all
we
are--
mr.
james
e.
kulp
--well,
we
know,
again,
by
just
a
survey
that
we
did
that
more
people
who
were
actually
convicted
of
capital
murder,
whether
they
be
black
on
white,
white
on
white,
whatever
it
is,
more
people
received
life
sentences
than
they
did
the
death
sentence.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
no,
sir.
the
point
i
am
trying
to
say
is
that
the
studies
which
we
think
are
fundamentally
flawed
because
the
raw
materials
or
the
raw
data
that
they
use
do
not
reflect
how
capital
punishment
is
being
imposed
in
virginia,
and
so
we
just
ran
a
survey
of
all
the
prosecutors
to
just
find
out,
and
so
we
are
confident
that
if
they
compared
capital
cases
or
persons
who
were
charged
with
capital
murder,
that
these
studies
would
not
indicate,
as
gross
and
morrow
tried
to
suggest,
that
the
likelihood
of
receiving
a
death
sentence
is
greater
if
a
black
kills
a
white.
those
facts
simply
would
not
stand
up
if
they
used
correct
information.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
yes,
sir,
your
honor,
and
one
has
been
executed
within
the
last
year.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
no,
sir,
i
don't
think
it
does.
justice
stevens,
the
record
indicates
that
at
least
one
of
the
jurors
knew
the
defendant
was
black,
but
it
doesn't
go
on
to
show
even
if
all
the
others
did,
and
there
is
no
indication
as
i
can
see
in
the
opinion
that
they
knew
that
the
guard
was
white.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
yes,
sir.
we
can't
tell
from
the
record.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
i
say,
in
our
case,
all
of
the
jurors
were
aware
of
the
defendant's
race
when
they
were
asked,
but
in
ristaino
the
record
is
not
clear.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
in
this
case
the
jury,
the
makeup
of
the
jury
was
four
blacks
and
eight
whites.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
the
foreman
was
black,
mr.
warsling.
and
so
we
submit
that
when
the
judge
has
all
these
things
before
him,
in
other
words,
when
the
veniremen
came
before
the
judge,
he
was
well
aware
that
the
venire
consisted
of
a
good
portion
of
blacks,
and
i
think
that
this
is
a
thing
that
the
judge
could
take
into
consideration
as
to
whether
he
thought
it
was
going
to
be
necessary
to
ask
a
specific
question
as
proposed
by
the
defendant.
we
would
ask
this
court
to
retain
the
rule
in
ristaino
because
we
believe
it
is
a
workable
rule.
we
think
it
worked
in
this
case,
and
we
would
ask
the
court
to
affirm
not
only
the
judgment
of
guilt
but
also
the
sentence.
