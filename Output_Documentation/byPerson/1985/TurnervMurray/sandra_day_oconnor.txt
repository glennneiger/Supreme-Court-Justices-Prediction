mr.
snook,
your
argument
strikes
me,
frankly,
as
asking
for
almost
a
cosmetic
change
which
would
have
the
effect
of
overturning
a
conviction
for
failure
to
meet
it.
the
judge
did
ask
of
the
panel
if
there
was
any
reason
whatever
why
the
jurors
could
not
serve
properly
in
this
case,
and
presumably
the
panel
didn't
indicate
or
no
one
indicated
they
could
not,
and
you
would
be
satisfied
with
a
single
additional
question
posed
to
the
entire
panel,
are
any
of
you
racially
biased?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
mean,
when
you
look
at
it
from
that
standpoint,
how
much
do
we
gain
by
that
kind
of
a
limited
inquiry?
that
is
what
troubles
me,
i
think,
about
your
argument.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
there
are
honest
jurors
on
the
panel
who
felt
they
were
racially
biased,
they
should
have
said
yes
in
response
to
the
more
general
question,
shouldn't
they?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
general
kulp...
oh,
excuse
me.
well,
counsel,
mr.
snook
responds
to
that
by
saying
there
was
no
way
the
jurors
could
have
known
at
that
time
that
it
was
a
white
victim.
and
presumably
they
could
see
that
it
was
a
black
defendant,
but
not
that
it
was
a
white
victim,
and
he
also
says,
this
is
a
capital
case
in
which
the
jury
will
have
broad
discretion
in
sentencing,
so
perhaps
you
ought
to
address
yourself
to
those
aspects
of
the
argument.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
concede
that
on
the
record
of
this
case
it
is
apparent
that
the
judge
did
not
exercise
discretion
in
making
this
determination--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--whether
to
ask
the
question?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
if
the
defendants
had
offered
all
the
things
that
they
have
offered
here
in
this
court
to
the
trial
judge.
do
you
think
the
trial
judge
under
those
circumstances
could
have
declined
to
ask
a
question
about
racial
violence?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
they
have
produced
a
number
of
studies
now
that
presumably
could
support
their
position,
and
you
think
if
all
of
those
things
had
been
available
to
the
trial
judge,
it
would
have
been
appropriate
for
the
judge
to
refuse
to
ask
a
single
question
about
racial
bias?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
it
had
been
in
a
federal
court,
he
would
have
had...
the
judge
would
have
to
ask.
