mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
presents
the
question
of
whether
willie
turner
was
denied
his
right
to
be
tried
by
an
impartial
jury
in
his
capital
murder
case
where
the
trial
judge
refused
to
allow
voir
dire
about
whether
the
fact
that
turner
is
black
and
his
victim
was
white
would
cause
prospective
jurors
to
be
prejudiced
against
him.
in
this
case,
turner's
trial
counsel
asked
the
judge
at
trial,
before
trial
to
tell
the
jury
that
turner
was
black,
that
his
victim
was
white,
and
to
ask
them
whether
these
facts
would
prejudice
you
against
willie
lloyd
turner.
the
trial
court
refused,
saying
simply
question
10,
which
is
the
question
that
we
are
talking
about
here,
has
been
ruled
on
by
the
supreme
court.
i
am
not
going
to
ask
that.
now,
it
is
important
to
note
that
counsel
had
just
immediately
before
this
discussion
of
voir
dire
finished
discussing
with
the
court
the
claim
that
the
death
penalty
was
discriminatorily
applied
against
blacks,
and
particularly
against
blacks
who
have
killed
whites.
the
court
had
refused
any
evidence
or
any
hearing,
but
evidence
had
been
proffered
to
that
effect,
and
i
think
it
is
safe
to
say
that
the
court
had
that
evidence
and
that
contention
firmly
in
mind
at
the
time.
this
court
has
held
in
ristaino
versus
ross
that
these
kinds
of
claims
are
to
be
adjudicated
essentially
on
a
case
by
case
analysis
in
which
the
question
is
whether
there
are
special
circumstances
about
the
crime
that
cause
one
to
believe
that
there
is
a
need
for
such
voir
dire.
one
of
our
points
is
that
the
special
circumstances
need
not
be
the
facts
of
the
case,
the
facts
of
the
crime
or
the
murder
as
much
as
they
may
also
include
the
facts
surrounding
the
prosecutions,
such
as
in
this
case,
since
the
facts
of
the
capital
murder
statute,
the
nature
of
the
statute
under
which
the
prosecution
is
being
conducted,
and
therefore
we
have
argued
that
capital
murder,
the
fact
of
a
capital
murder
prosecution
itself
is
one
of
those
special
circumstances
that
this
court
ought
to
find
requires
such
voir
dire.
we
have
addressed
all
of
these
issues
fully
in
our
briefs,
which
we
incorporate
into
this
argument
by
reference,
but
i
would
like
to
address
one
thing
in
particular
in
this
argument
that
we
have
not
really
focused
on
before.
that
is
exactly
the
scope
of
a
rule
that
we
would
suggest
that
this
court
could
or
should
make
in
such
a
case.
now,
there
is
in
this
court's
jurisprudence
on
voir
dire
issues
a
tension
between
the
virtue
of
clarity
on
the
one
hand
that
comes
with
per
se
rules
and
on
the
other
hand
the
flexibility
that
comes
with
the
discretionary
approach
or
leaving
it
all
to
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court.
this
court
need
not
decide
whether
a
state
must
apply
a
bright
line
rule
in
such
a
case.
some
states
have.
georgia
has,
for
example,
in
capital
murder
cases.
rhode
island,
massachusetts,
pennsylvania
have
in
other
kinds
of
cases.
you
could
continue
to
rely
on
ristaino
versus
ross's
discretion-based
analysis
provided
that
you
make
clear
that
the
discretion
must
be
exercised
in
a
capital
case
with
due
regard
for
the
special
circumstances
of
a
capital
case.
for
example,
due
regard
for
the
greater
discretion
that
the
jury
is
given
in
a
capital
case
than
was
given
in
ristaino
versus
ross
or
rosales-lopez
versus
united
states
or
the
other
cases
in
which
this
court
has
considered
this
issue.
the
discretion
given
to
a
jury
in
virginia
to
impose
the
death
sentence
is
basically
unlimited
once
an
aggravating
circumstance
has
been
found.
the
virginia
statute
is
essentially
identical
to
the
georgia
statue
in
this
regard,
so
that
the
degree
of
discretion
that
you
found
and
noted
in
zant
versus
stevens
applies
absolutely
in
this
case
as
well.
and
the
second
thing
that
is
important
about
capital
cases
is
the
possibility
that
racial
prejudice
will
manifest
itself
in
the
death
and
life
decision,
and
for
that
we
have
suggested
that
the
history
of
racial
discrimination
and
the
history
of
the
discriminatory
application
in
this
country
is
evidence
if
not
necessarily
evidence
high
enough
to
allow
us
to
argue
to
you
that
the
entire
statutory
scheme
should
be
invalidated,
at
least
high
enough
to
suggest
that
in
the
words
of
justice
white
in
rosales-lopez,
that
there
is
a
substantial...
a
more
substantial
indication
of
a
likelihood
of
racial
prejudice
in
this
kind
of
case.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
well,
your
honor,
i--
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
--your
honor,
i
would
argue
in
this
particular
case
all
that
we
are
presenting
you
with
is
the
black
on
white
situation,
and
we
have--
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
--i
understanding.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
i
understand.
my
position
is
that
you
could
draw
a
very
narrow
rule
recognizing
the
problem
of
black
and
white
relationships
in
this
country.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
well,
i
think
that
there
you
could
again
fall
back
on
the
case
by
case
sort
of
analysis,
and
i
don't
think
it
is
necessarily
wrong
to
say
that
in
a
case
where...
for
example,
let
us
suppose
that
we
are
in
a
place
in
texas
in
which
there
is
a
greater
history
of
discrimination
against
people
with
spanish
surnames.
if
we
are
in
a
place
like
that,
where
there
is
some
history
of
discrimination,
that
may
be
more
of
a
problem.
i
tend
to
look
at
it
from
the
virginia
perspective,
where
at
least
in
charlottesville
there
are
very
few
indeed
hispanics,
and
so
we
don't
perceive
there
being
a
problem
of
discrimination
against
hispanics.
in
a
different
community,
in
a
different
fact
situation,
there
may
well
be
enough
of
a
problem
so
that
this
court
and
lower
courts
would
have
to
find
that
such
voir
dire
would
be
appropriate.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
your
honor,
if
you
choose
to
apply
that,
the
narrowest
possible
ground
on
which
we
have
urged
relief
in
this
particular
case
with
simply
the
decision
that
the
trial
judge
must
consider,
at
the
very
least,
must
consider
the
unique
characteristics
of
the
death
penalty
statute
and
the
unique
characteristics
of
the
death
penalty
decision,
and
you
add
in
this
particular
case
the
fact
that
not
just
the
trial
and
the
jury
was
being
move
to
a
different
location,
but
the
judge
who
was
conducting
the
voir
dire
and
counsel
also
were
going
to
a
jurisdiction
with
which
they
were
not
familiar
in
this
instance.
one
of
the
reasons
this
court
has
traditionally
given
that
degree
of
discretion
to
the
trial
judge
is
that
that
discretion
is
informed
by
familiarity
with
the
local
ethos,
the
local
citizenry,
which
in
this
case
the
trial
judge
did
not
have.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
this
case
was
tried
in
northhampton
county,
which
is
on
the
eastern
shore
of
virginia,
and
southampton
county
was
where
the
crime
occurred,
and
is
the
area
from
which
the
judge
comes
and
where
the
judge
sits.
in
virginia
the
judges
sit
in
narrowly
circumscribed
circuits,
and
it
would
be
an
extraordinary
instance
in
which
they
would
go
elsewhere.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
yes,
they
are
not
contiguous.
you
go
from
northhampton
county
south
through
the
cities
of
virginia
beach
and
norfolk
and
suffolk,
and
then
over
to
southampton
county,
and
i
believe
the
respondent
has
said
it
is
about
80
miles.
i
believe
that
is
essentially
accurate.
certainly
there
is
a
significant
differences,
and
the
judges
of
one
area
do
not
sit
in
the
other
area.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
the
change
of
venue
was
basically
because
of
pretrial
publicity.
now,
we
are
not
arguing--
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
--yes.
now,
we
are
not
arguing
that
there
was
any
abuse
in
the
discretion
to
have
moved
it
to
northhampton
county.
in
fact,
as
respondents
have
noted,
one
of
the
things
that
was
perhaps
good
about
this
particular
move
was
that
both
southampton
and
northhampton
county
had
essentially
the
same
racial
mix,
46.4
percent
black
in
both
counties.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
at
least
in
a
case
in
which
the
judge
sits
there
and
actively
thinks
about
the
unique
aspects
of
the
capital
statute.
it
is
important
to
remember
that
in
this
case
we
do
not
have
the
instance
of
the
judge
sitting
there
and
saying,
well,
i
am
going
to
weigh
the
following
factors
pro
and
the
following
factors
con
and
say
no.
all
he
said
was,
that
case
has
already...
that
question
has
already
been
decided
by
the
supreme
court.
i
am
not
going
to
ask
that
question.
in
other
words,
if
he
is
going
to
exercise
discretion,
it
has
to
be
a
discretion
that
at
least
contemplates
the
possibility
that
there
would
be
some
cases
that
would
allow
for
such
a
question.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
in
this
particular
case,
your
honor--
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
--i
am
obviously
here
asking
you
to
hold
that
in
this
case
the
judge
abused
his
discretion.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
your
honor,
i
don't
suggest
that
the
constitution
requires
in
this
case
or
as
a
general
matter
individual
voir
dire,
or
that
any
particular
form
of
voir
dire--
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
--at
the
very
least,
yes.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
i
think
that
that
is
the
minimum
that
the
constitution
requires,
yes.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
yes.
as
a
constitutional
basis,
yes.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
well,
i
am
prepared
to
assume,
as
this
court
has
in
the
past,
that
jurors
will
answer
truthfully.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
it
is
complicated
a
little
bit
by
the
fact
that
there
are
cities
in
between,
and
in
virginia
cities
and
counties
are
separate
jurisdictions,
but
i
think--
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
--that's
right,
the
chesapeake
bay
is
the
bigger
problem,
because
we
are...
you
have
to
go
across
the
chesapeake
bay,
i
think
it
is
really
safe
to
say
that
the
eastern
shore
is
considerably
isolated
from
the
rest
of
the
state,
and
justice
powell,
i
am
sure,
is
familiar
with
the
geographical
problems
that
we
have
in
this
state
in
integrating
the
eastern
shore
into
the
rest
of
the
state.
while
it
has
some--
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
--or
vice
versa.
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
that
may
well
be.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
i
don't
know
offhand
how
the
crow
flies,
because
you
are
going
at
sort
of
an
angle.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
your
honor,
i
know
that
it
is
about
20
miles
or
30
miles
from
the
county
seat
of
northhampton
county
down
to
norfolk,
at
which
point
one
heads
west
about
50
miles.
i
think
that
is
the
basis
for
the
80-mile
submission.
exactly
how
the
crow
flies
in
this
instance
i
couldn't
tell
you,
but
i
suppose
if
one
figured
out
the
hypotenuse
it
might
give
you
the
answer.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
if
you
follow
the
shoreline,
you
are
in
real
trouble.
so,
in
this
case
all
that
we
are
saying
is
that
there
may
be
a
continuim,
a
spectrum,
if
you
will,
of
justifiable
and
supportable
constitutional
rules
going
from
the...
still
adhering
to
the
case
by
case
analysis
in
ristaino
versus
ross
all
the
way
over
to
a
bright
line
rule
that
says
in
every
single
capital
case
in
every
state
in
the
union
there
must
be
such
voir
dire.
now,
i
don't
think
you
have
to
decide
where
on
that
spectrum
necessarily
to
fall.
what
you
could
do
is
to
say
all
that
is
necessary
is
that
one
way
or
another,
either
the
state
courts
adopt
a
per
se
rule
or
they
adopt
a
discretionary
rule
that
takes
these
other
factors
into
consideration,
but
the
problem
is
that
at
no
time
in
this
case
did
we
ever
get
up
to
that
level,
because
the
court
never
considered
any
circumstances
surrounding
the
proper
voir
dire
in
this
case.
now,
as
i
said,
you
could
adopt
a
number
of
different
per
se
rules.
one
would
be
every
capital
case.
a
second
might
be...
a
more
limited
one
would
be
to
say
every
capital
case
in
which
the
jury
does
the
sentencing,
and
of
course
there
are
about
seven
states
in
which
the
death
sentence
is
imposed
where
it
is
really
a
judge
sentencing
state,
alabama
being
one,
florida
being
another,
arizona.
those
are
states
in
which
this
same
rule
might
not
apply.
or
down
to
the
case
of
every
capital
case
in
a
state
where
the
jury
has
essentially
unfettered
discretion,
as
in
georgia,
as
in
virginia.
you
can
also
consider
simply
the
fact
of
every
jury
sentencing
case,
which
would
be
a
broader
rule
that
would
apply
obviously
not
only
to
capital
cases,
but
would
apply
to
non-capital
cases
in
those
seven
states
that
still
have
jury
sentencing.
but
again,
you
don't
have
to
adopt
any
one
of
those
per
se
rules.
what
you
might
well
do
is
simply
decide
that
the
states
must
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
either
adopt
a
per
se
rule
that
considers
these
facts
or
must
adopt
a
discretion
based
rule
that
considers
these
facts,
but
that
in
either
event
you
must
consider
the
unique
characteristics
of
the
capital
sentence.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
the
exercise
of
the
judge's
discretion
is
what...
well,
your
honor--
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
--i
would
think
so,
yes.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
i
would
think
so,
and
in
fact
that
would
be
part
of
the
local
knowledge
that
a
local
judge
would
have
that
would
make
that
decision
and
that
exercise
of
discretion
better
informed.
there
are
a
number
of
factors
like
that
which...
obviously,
in
ham
versus
south
carolina
this
court
recognized
that
a
familiarity
with
the
local
ethos
there,
familiarity
with
the
racial
prejudice
that
was
a
problem
in
that
case
was
one
of
the
reasons...
was
one
of
the
factors
to
take
into
account,
and
therefore
that
the
judge,
having
failed
to
take
those
factors
into
account,
abused
his
discretion
in
not
having
asked
those
questions.
but
all
we
are
saying
is
that
at
a
bare
minimum,
the
bare
mandatory
minimum
that
this
court
should
require
is
that
the
trial
judge
consider
the
unique
needs
of
a
capital
case.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
i
think
that
would
certainly
be
helpful
in
this
particular
case--
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
--i
think
that
if
it
is
to
be
considered
as
an
exercise
of
discretion,
that
yes,
it
would
have
to
be...
either
he
would
have
to
say,
yes,
i
have
considered
these
factors,
or
would
have
to
give
some
other
indication
some
place
that
he
is
not
simply
ruling
out
of
his
hip
pocket.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
only
the
part
of
the
constitution...
your
honor,
this
is
still
a
sixth
amendment
claim,
and
while
the
sixth
amendment
may
not
spell
out
specifically
that
he
has
to
put
in
writing
every
reason
for
what
he
is
doing,
and
i
understand
of
course
in
witt
versus
wainwright
that
this
court
held
that
a
judge
does
not
have
to
give
written
findings
of
fact
every
time
he
decides
that
somebody
should
not
sit
as
a
juror,
but
that
is
not
what
we
are
talking
about.
all
we
are
talking
about
here
is
that
there
be
some
evidence
from
the
record,
however
he
wants
to
put
that
evidence
into
the
record,
that
those
factors
were
considered.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
in
writing,
it
doesn't
have
to
follow
any
particular
form,
but
the
record
must
show
in
some
way
that
this
issue
has
been
considered
and
the
unique
aspects
of
the
case
have
been
considered.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
as
a
bare
minimum,
yes.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
okay.
what
we
gain,
first
of
all,
is
the
fact
that
at
the
very
least
if
there
are
honest
jurors
on
the
panel,
as
we
assume
that
there
are,
that
those
jurors
will
say
yes.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
the
more
general
question
does
not
call
their
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
victim
was
white.
now,
we
all
know
that
as
a
practical
matter,
what
often
happens
in
capital
cases
is
that
the
jury
considers
in
some
way
or
another
the
relative
worth
of
the
life
of
the
defendant
against
the
relative
worth
of
the
life
of
the
man
he
killed,
and
it
is
unfortunately
the
case
that
all
too
often
people,
blacks,
when
the
blacks
are
the
victims,
for
whatever
reason,
the
death
penalty
does
not
get
applied.
i
have
to
assume
on
the
basis
of
all
the
research
that
has
been
done
that
that
is
based
in
large
part
on
the
notion
that
the
jurors
do
take
that
into
account.
now,
i
have
to
assume
again
that
asking
the
question
would
have
some
utility,
first
of
all,
because
i
assume
that
they
are
honest
jurors,
second,
because
at
the
very
least
they
would
begin
to
think
about
the
possibility
of
their
own
prejudice.
if
they
did
not
even
know
that
the
race
of
the
victim...
that
the
victim
was
white,
there
is
no
way
that
they
can
answer
a
question
that
has
not
been
asked,
and
i
don't
think
it
is
reasonable
to
expect
as
the
respondent
would
have
us
do
that
someone
hearing
the
question,
do
you
know
of
any
reason
why
you
could
not
be
fair
in
this
case,
would
say,
if
it
turns
out
that
the
victim
is
white,
i
am
going
to
vote
to
execute
him.
and
that
is
basically
what
they
are
suggesting.
now,
i
have
asked
to
be
allowed
to
reserve
some
time
for
rebuttal
here,
and
i
would
simply
like
to
note
that
as
this
court
has
noted
in
gardner
and
in
beck,
that
it
is
important
in
this
case,
as
in
all
capital
cases,
both...
it
is
important
both
to
the
defendant
and
to
the
community
that
any
decision
to
impose
the
death
sentence
be
and
appear
to
be
based
on
reason
rather
than
emotion.
all
that
we
are
asking
in
this
case
is
that
black
capital
defendants
have
the
right
to
be
sure
that
inadmissible
influences
such
as
race
not
be
allowed
to
decide
who
lives
and
who
dies.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
if
you
had
the
same
history
of
racial
discrimination
in
that
community,
i
think
that
would
be
a
valid
concern.
i
think
the
court
ought
to
require
voir
dire
in
that
case.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
obviously.
your
honor,
that
is
a
discretionary
matter.
i
recognize
that
my
model
of
judicial
decision-making
still
retains
a
great
deal
of
discretion
for
the
trial
court
as
to
those
other
additional
factors.
i
have
suggested
a
couple
of
ways
that
that
discretion
might
be
guided,
a
couple
of
per
se
rules
that
this
court
may
follow.
as
to
the
additional
cases,
the
cases
not
presented
on
the
basis
of
this
factual
record
or
on
the
basis
of
the
issues
presented
here,
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
would
hope
that
this
court
would
give
the
judges
some
guidance
in
those
decisions
they
would
have
to
make
in
the
future.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
at
least
in
that
instance
the
judge
would
have
considered
those
things.
he
would
have
said
that
i
am
familiar
with
the
local
citizenry,
and
he
would
have
made
these
specific
statements,
and
we
would
know
that
he
had
in
fact
carried
out
his
duty.
we
don't
know
that
in
this
case.
whether
he
would
be
reversed
on
that
factual
record,
i
suppose
the
court
would
again
have
to
fall
back
to
the
abuse
of
discretion
standard.
has
he
abused
his
discretion?
we
couldn't
really
tell
until
we
saw
the
facts
of
that
case.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
your
honor,
what
we
have--
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
--the
problem
is
that,
if
i
may,
your
honor,
the
issue
is
a
bit
more
complicated
than
that,
and
i
don't
want
to
concede
something--
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
--ultimately,
i
would
suspect
that
if
he
were
retried
on
guilt,
he
would
be
convicted
anyway,
and
what
we
really
most
want
is
to
keep
him
out
of
the
electric
chair.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
well,
obviously,
we
are
predicating
our
whole
approach
on
the
fact
that
it
is
capital--
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
--no,
we
would
not
be.
not
in
that
sense,
no.
if
i
might--
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
--justice
white,
if
i
might,
let
me
say
that
the
problem
that
i
have
is
that
under
this
court's
decisions
such
as
toomey
versus
ohio
and
cases
of
that
nature
that
have
dealt
with
the
abridgement
of
the
right
to
an
impartial
finder
of
fact,
an
impartial
trier,
this
court
has
never
attempted
to
get
into
harmless
error
analyses.
because
we
have
mounted
an
attack
on
the
impartiality
of
the
finder
of
fact,
then
i
don't
feel
that
i
can
properly
concede
to
you
that
we
should
not
go
back
for
a
new
trial
on
guilt
or
innocence
as
well.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
i
may
be
being
excessively
cautious,
your
honor,
in
not
trying
to
concede
something
that
may
have
ramifications
or
implications
that
i
don't
want.
as
i
say,
my
concern...
before
the
fourth
circuit,
after
i
was
being
asked
essentially
the
same
question,
i
acknowledged
that
there
really
wasn't
much
question
about
guilt.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
yes.
i
also
recognize
that
this
court
could
probably
properly
set
aside
only
the
death
sentence.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
i
don't
think
there
really
is.
no,
your
honor.
not
as
to
whether
he
committed
the
murder
and
that
kind
of...
i
mean,
i
think
there
are
some
other
issues
one
might
get
into,
but
to
be
perfectly
candid--
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
--no,
but--
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
--i
don't
believe
he
did,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
no,
he
did
not.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
i
am
pretty
sure,
your
honor,
there
was
only
one
person
shot
at,
and
that
was
jack
smith.
he
was
disarmed
immediately
after
that
by
the
guard...
by
the
police
officer,
but
the
problem
is
that
this
court
has
held,
and
the
reason
i
am
trying
not
to
concede
more
than
i
have
to
is
that
this
court
has
held
in
irvin
versus
dowd
among
other
places
that
you
don't
try
to
apply
a
harmless
error
analysis
in
a
case
where
it
has
been
found
that
there
is
a
violation
of
the
right
to
an
impartial
factfinder,
and
that
is
applied
in
irvin
versus
dowd
irrespective,
as
this
court
said,
irrespective
of
the
guilt,
irrespective
of
the
heinousness
of
the
crime,
irrespective
of
the
station
of
the
offender.
now,
let
me
talk
just
a
second
about
how
this
study
that
we
were
talking
about
earlier
came
to
get
into
the
record.
in
the
appendix,
at
page
12
and
13,
mr.
woodard
says,
"the
statement
that
i
made
regarding
the
disproportionate
application
of
the
death
penalty
is
based
on
a
study
which
again
i
would
state
that
we
would
like
to
submit
subsequently.
"
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
woodard
is
the
counsel
for
petitioner,
counsel
for
defendant.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
this
was...
in
the
preliminary
goings
on
before
the
calling
of
the
jury,
before
the
voir
dire,
when
he
was
making
his
objection
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
he
said,
"we
would
like
mr.
grizzard
to
see
it.
"
obviously
implying
that
he
had
it
there,
and
then
later
on
the
judge
says,
"well,
gentlemen
of
course,
our
supreme
court
has
ruled
on
this
question
in
practically
every
case
that
has
gone
up.
"
"i
so
rule
at
this
time.
"
"i
note
your
exception
in
the
record.
"
"your
honor,
may
we
preserve
the
right
to
submit
that
study.
"
and
the
court
then
says,
"you
can
submit
any
study
you
desire
and
i
will
file
it
as
part
of
the
record.
"
but
i
think
the
implication
is
clear
that
had
they
been
allowed
to
go
forward,
they
would
have
gone
forward.
now,
the
other--
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
--in
addressing
the
concern
that
this
court
may
be
having
as
to
whether
the
judge
had
the
issue
and
the
facts
in
front
of
him
on
which
to
base
the
motion
or
the
argument
we
are
now
making,
he
would
have
had
them
there,
would
have
had
the
facts
in
front
of
him
in
the
form
of
that
study
sufficient
to
allow
an
open-minded
judge
to
look
at
them,
read
them,
and
understand
them,
but
he
obviously
had
closed
his
mind
before
he
got
to
that
point.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
well,
yes,
he
is,
except
that
this
court
had
not
in
1979
and
still
has
not
to
this
day
ruled
in
anything
that
is
precedential,
that
has
any
precedential
value
as
opposed
to
denials
of
cert
that
the
virginia
death
penalty
statute
is
being
fairly
applied.
this
is
that
first
time
that
a
virginia
death
case
has
come
to
this
court,
so
in
a
very
strict
sense
the
judge
was
incorrect
in
saying
that
this
particular
issue
had
been
resolved.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
he
may
well
have
perceived
it
wrong,
but
that
was
his
perception,
and
yes,
he
should
follow
the
dictates
of
this
court.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
that
is
also
possible.
he
was
not
clean
on
that.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
it
isn't
any
secret
now.
i
will
be
perfectly
honest
with
you.
i
did
not
know
the
composition
of
the
jury
until...
because
it
had
not
come
up
at
any
point
in
the
proceedings
of
record.
i
didn't
know
the
composition
until
i
saw
the
addendum
to
the
respondent's
brief.
this
is
the
reason
we
filed
the
motion
that
we
did
to
strike
that
affidavit.
i
have
no
reason
to
doubt
it,
quite
frankly,
and
in
fact
what
information
i
have
from
trial
counsel
confirms
it.
it
also
confirms--
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
--it
also
confirms
that
the
commonwealth
struck
virtually
all
blacks,
and
the
defendant
struck
all
whites,
and
that
they
perceived
that
there
was
a
real
racial
problem
there.
anyway,
a
couple
of
other
issues
that
i
want
to
touch
on
that
have
been
raised
in
your
questions
to
mr.
kulp--
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
--but
i
see
i
don't
have
any
more
time.
thank
you,
your
honor.
