justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
you
wouldn't
be
satisfied
if
we
just
said
that.
you
want
us
to
say
that
the
discretion
could
not
have
been
exercised
in
these
circumstances
to
refuse
the
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
do?
would
you
insist
that
the
jurors
be
individually
questioned,
or
just
a
general
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
would
you
expect?
would
this
be...
this
would
be
to
the
entire
panel?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
at
the
very
least.
would
that
satisfy
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
answer
is
yes?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
expect
that
that
really
would
do
some
good,
that
some
people
would
raise
their
hand
and
say,
yes,
i
am
racially
prejudiced?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
thank
that
the...
you
must
think
that
the
chance
of
there
being
racial
prejudice
among
the
jurors
is
sufficient
to
try
to
weed
these
people
out.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
in
rosales,
although
it
was
a
supervisory
case,
the
reason
the
rule
was
imposed
was
because
when
there
is
a...
where
the
victim
and
the
defendant
are
of
different
races,
there
is
a
reasonable
possibility
of
prejudice.
that
is
what
the
court
said.
right
or
wrong,
that
is
what
it
said,
and
it
is
a
violent
crime.
a
violent
crime
plus
victim
and
defendant
of
different
races,
that
raises
a
reasonable
possibility
of
prejudice.
now,
if
you
accept
that,
i
would
think
that
at
least
that
is
this
court's
opinion
that
in
those
circumstances
there
is
a
reasonable
possibility.
what
would
you
think
if
you
accepted
that
in
your
case?
do
you
think
the
question
should
be
asked
if
there
is
a
reasonable
possibility
of
prejudice?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
special
circumstance
in
rosales
was
identified
specifically.
that
is
one
of
the
special
circumstances
where
as
a
supervisory
matter
the
question
must
be
asked,
but
only
because
that
raises
a
reasonable
possibility
of
prejudice,
just
those
special
circumstances.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
is
no
doubt
about
that,
but
the
predicate
for
its
rule
was
that...
at
least
the
rule
that
it
applied
and
found
to
have
been
satisfied
here
in
rosales
was
this
rule
i
just
stated
to
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
must
be
inconsistent
with
ristaino.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
came
first?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
understand
that
the
attack
in
this
case
is
on
the
conviction
or
the
death
sentence
or
both?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
discretion
in
the
prosecutor
as
to...
for
a
particular
crime
whether
to
charge
capital
murder
or
something
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
prosecutor
then
was
urging
the
death
penalty?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know.
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
have
the
defendant
in
court
during
the
voir
dire?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
ask,
mr.
snook?
do
you
attack
the
conviction?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
yes
or
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
are
bound
to
come
out
with
a
conclusion.
tell
me
what
it
is
first.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
normally
when
only
a
sentence
is
under
attack,
we
just
vacate
the
sentence
and
leave
the
conviction
intact.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
this
hadn't
been...
if
the
same
crime
had
been
charged
except
it
wasn't
charged
as
a
capital
crime,
would
you
be
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
you
can
just
answer
no,
you
wouldn't
be
here,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
in
that
sense?
you
wouldn't
be
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
why
do
you
hinge
your
whole
case
on
it
being
a
death
case?
you
should
say
in
any
violent
case,
any
case
of
a
murder
where
the
victim
is
white
and
the
defendant
is
black,
this
question
must
be
asked.
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
just
ask
you
then,
do
you
ask
us
to
set
aside
the
conviction
as
well
as
the
death
sentence?
yes
or
no?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
when
was
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it
is
important,
if
it
turns
out
to
have
any
relevance
to
this
case,
is
there
any
question
about
what
the
composition
of
the
jury
was?
it
isn't
any
secret,
is
it?
what
was
the
composition?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
all
i
need
to
know.
