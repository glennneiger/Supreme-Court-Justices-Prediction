chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
turner
against
the
director
of
the
virginia
department
of
corrections.
mr.
snook,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
the
defendant,
mr.
snook,
is
puerto
rican.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
would
ask
the
same
question
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
asking
you
a
hypothetical
question.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
because
the
question
you
are
putting
may
answer
the
other
question.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
about
hispanics
then?
and,
of
course,
puerto
rican
may
be
categorized
as
hispanic
under
some
circumstances.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
are
the
guidelines
for
the
exercise
of
that
discretion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
must
he
take
a
look
at
the
ethnic
and
racial
composition
of
the
particular
jurisdiction,
that
is
to
say
that
it
is
one-third
hispanic
or
one-third
something
else
or--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--one-third
austrians?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
part
of
the
constitution
would
he
be
relying
on?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
a
white
capital
defendant
in
a
community
that
may
be
predominantly
negro?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
does
the
history...
how
do
you
measure
that
history?
who
decides
what
that
history
is?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
the
judge
then
says,
well,
i
have
been
sitting
in
this
jurisdiction
for
20
years,
and
i
reject
the
idea,
the
notion
that
there
has
been
any
discriminatory
administration
of
justice,
and
i
would
regard
the
question
that
you
propose
as
an
offensive
question
to
be
put
to
an
american
citizen?
is
he
going
to
be
reversed
for
abuse
of
discretion,
or
where
do
we
go
from
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
snook.
mr.
kulp.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
snook?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
closed
his
mind,
as
you
put
it,
on
the
basis
of
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
he
is
supposed
to
follow
decisions
of
this
court,
is
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
wasn't
addressing
the
correctness
of
his
statement.
i
was
addressing
what
he
said.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
snook.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
