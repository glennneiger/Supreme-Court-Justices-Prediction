justice
john
paul
stevens
am
i
correct,
we
don't
know
how
many
of
these
180
people
actually
were
eligible
for
the
death
penalty
in
the
sense
that
the
jury
had
an
opportunity
to
impose
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
that
is
a
comparison
within
the
universe
of
blacks
who
killed
whites.
it
doesn't
compare
blacks
who
killed
whites
with
blacks
who
killed
blacks
or
whites
who
killed
whites.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
john
paul
stevens
has
virginia
ever
imposed
a
death
penalty
on
a
black
who
killed
a
black?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
in
your
study
of
the
ristaino
case
which
involves
a
black
defendant
and
a
white
prison
guard
as
i
remember
it,
does
the
record
tell
us
whether
the
jurors
knew
that
the
victim
was
white
at
the
time
of
the
voir
dire?
do
you
happen
to
know?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
one
excused
himself
without
really
knowing
the
race
of
the
victim.
