ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
government
employee
union
can
require
a
government
agency
to
bargain
over,
and
therefore
to
make
a
subject
of
grievance
arbitration,
a
proposal
that
would
give
the
union
the
right
to
enforce
the
provisions
of
circular
a-76.
the
court
below
held
that
a
government
employee
union
can
enforce
the
circular,
but
this
result
is
anomalous.
a-76
is
a
management
directive.
it
flows
from
the
authority
of
the
president
to
manage
the
budget
and
to
manage
the
executive
branch,
and
it
implements
the
president's
economic
policies.
the
circular
itself
expressly
reserves
to
the
president
and
to
his
delegates
the
authority
to
enforce
the
circular.
but
the
decision
below
turned
enforcement
of
the
a-76
directive
and
of
the
president's
management
authority,
and
in
turn
the
interpretation
of
the
directive,
over
to
arbitrators,
with
review
perhaps
only
by
the
federal
labor
relations
authority,
perhaps
no
judicial
review.
this
result
is
not
only
contrary
to
the
express
language
of
the
circular,
but
it
also
interferes
with
the
authority
of
the
president
to
give
directives
to
his
subordinates
and
to
enforce
those
directives
in
his
own
way.
it
should
not
be
assumed
that
congress
would
have
intended
this
anomalous
result
and
this
disruptive
result,
absent
some
clear
statutory
authority.
but
on
the
contrary,
the
statute
in
fact
requires
no
such
solution.
let
me
try
to
condense
here
very
quickly
the
statutory
provisions
that
are
at
issue.
all
the
parties
agree
that
title
7
of
the
civil
service
reform
act
gives
management
the
right
to
make
determinations
with
respect
to
contracting
out,
and
all
parties
also
agree
that
the
only
constraint
on
that
management
right
is
that
it
be...
that
is,
the
only
constraint
that's
at
issue
in
this
case...
is
that
the
right
to
contract
out
be
exercised
"in
accordance
with
applicable
laws".
so
that
the
question
for
decision
is
whether
the
phrase
a-76.
the
first
and
most
important
reason
why
the
a-76
is
not
a
law
at
all.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
that
ends
the
inquiry
in
our
view,
justice
o'connor.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
that's
correct.
if
you
say
it's
not
a
law,
that
ends
the
inquiry,
because--
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
--that's
right.
but
it's
our
submission
that
the
language
of
7106,
which
says
nothing
in
this
chapter
shall
interfere
with
management
rights,
that
that
applies
to
not
only
the
negotiability
issue,
but
also
to
the
grievability
issue,
and
the
respondents
have
not
presented
any
reason
why
congress
would
nave
said
nothing
in
this
chapter
when
in
fact
it
meant
nothing
relating
to
bargainability
or
negotiability.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
yes.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
well,
of
course
the
language
there
is
a
bit
different.
it
doesn't
say
"laws".
it
says
"laws,
rules,
and
regulations.
"
and
we
also
have
some
rather
specific
legislative
history
there
that
indicates
that
congress
was
concerned
that
unions
not
be
able
to
create
rules
that
would
conflict
with
government-wide
policies.
it
did
not
want
inconsistencies
among
the
agencies.
so
that
there's,
number
one,
a
difference
in
language
and,
number
two,
some
rather
specific
legislative
history.
and
in
fact,
the
respondents
agree
that
a-76
is
a
law,
rule,
or
regulation
within
the
meaning
of
7117.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
the
circular
has
been
lodged
with
the
court,
justice.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
well,
i
can
show
it
to
you.
it's
really
fairly
long.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
well,
i
apologize
if
the
court
does
not
have
those
materials
available
to
it.
this
is
the
supplement,
your
honor
is
correct.
the
directive
itself
is
in
the
federal
register
at
volume
48
beginning
at
page
<thirty-seven
thousand
one
hundred
and
ten>
[=
37110].
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
it's
quite
short.
my
apologies
to
the
court.
to
continue
then
as
to
why
a-75
is
not
a
law
within
the
meaning
of
the
a-75
itself
makes
clear
that
it
is
not
a
law
and
that
it's
only
binding
effect
flows
from
the
president's
authority.
the
circular
states
that
it
does
not
establish
and
shall
not
be
construed
to
create
any
basis
for
anyone
to
challenge
agency
action
or
inaction
on
the
grounds
that
that
action
or
inaction
was
not
in
accordance
with
the
circular.
the
only
challenge
to
agency
action
that
the
circular
permits
is
by
a
very
expedited
appeals
procedure
that
the
circular
creates
within
the
agency.
and
it's
important
that
this
procedure
is
a
very
rapid
one.
people
who
would
like
to
challenge
the
agency's
decision
to
contract
out
must
file
their
appeal
within
15
days,
and
the
agency
within
itself
must
decide
within
30
days.
and
again,
there's
no
further
right
to
review
beyond
that
appeal
within
the
agency.
every
court
and
administrative
body
other
than
the
court
below
that
has
been
asked
to
enforce
circular
a-76
has
respected
the
limitations
that
are
contained
within
the
language
of
the
circular
itself
and
has
refused
to
create
third
party
enforcement
rights.
two
courts
of
appeal
have
turned
down
challenges
brought
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
the
ninth
circuit
has
ruled
in
direct
conflict
with
the
decision
of
the
court
below.
and
perhaps
most
importantly,
the
merit
system
protection
board,
which
is
the
congress
agency
which
has
authority
to
enforce
employee
rights
in
a
non-union
context,
the
mstb
has
held
that
an
employee's
challenge
to
a
reduction
in
force
brought
on
the
theory
that
the
reduction
in
force
was
required
by
an
incorrect
decision
to
contract
out,
that
that
kind
of
challenge
would
not
be
brought
predicated
on
a-76.
thus,
is
seeking
the
right
to
enforce
a-76,
the
union
is
seeking
a
right
that
non-union
employees
indisputably
do
not
have,
and
it's
our
view
that
congress
did
not
anywhere
express
any
intent
to
create
this
kind
of
disparity.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
well,
it
would
have
really
a
very
substantive
effect.
the
union
suggests
that
its
proposal
is
a
modest
one
of
trying
to
enforce
a-76.
but
because
they
want
to
enforce
a-76,
but
don't
want
to
accept
the
conditions
under
which
the
president
was
willing
to
issue
a-76,
the
union's
discretion
to
make
contracting
out
decisions
is
very
severely
impinged
when
grievance--
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
--i'm
sorry,
i
misspoke.
the
agency's
authority
to
make,
discretion
to
make
contracting
out
decisions.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
well,
when
a
grievance
is
filed,
justice
o'connor,
the
agency
is
really
placed
in
a
difficult
dilemma.
the
agency--
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
--well,
the
grievance
and
arbitration...
i
think
our
point
is
that
the
grievance
and
arbitration
procedures
would
affect
the
substance
of
contracting
out,
because
the
agency's
decisions
will
be
affected.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
that's
correct,
but
that's
because
they
do
not
admit
that
the
"nothing
in
this
chapter"
language
applies
to
the
grievance
proceedings
as
well
as
to
the
negotiability
context.
but
the
reason
why
there's
a
substantive
problem
here
and
not
just
a
procedural
problem
for
the
agency
is
because
when
a
grievance
is
filed
the
agency
is
faced
with
quite
a
dilemma.
it
either
has
to
decide
to
proceed
with
the
contract,
in
which
case
it
risks
later
having--
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
--that's
right.
and
to
be
a
little
more
concrete,
they
might
say,
for
example,
well,
you
didn't
determine
personnel
cost
correctly
in
making
your
comparison
between
in-house
costs
and
costs
that
would
be
incurred
using
an
outside
contractor.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
it
would
be.
and
in
fact,
it's
interesting,
the
authority
even
agrees
that
management
discretion
would
be
interfered
with
under
those
circumstances.
they
say
at
least
in
some
cases.
now,
their
proposed
solution
we
think
is
not
really
a
solution
at
all.
they
say
the
arbitrators
will
stay
their
hands;
don't
worry,
the
arbitrators
will
not
be
permitted
to
second
guess
discretionary
judgments
of
the
agency.
but
in
fact,
the
authority
doesn't
cite
any
statutory
language
which
would
so
constrain
the
authority
of
the
arbitrator.
and
actually,
i
draw
the
conclusion
from
that
that
the
authority
doesn't
fully
believe
what
is
says.
they
say
that
the
management
rights
clause
does
not
apply
to
the
grievance
proceedings,
but
yet
they
say,
well,
when
arbitrators
get
into
a
discretionary
area
they'll
stay
their
hands.
but
they
don't
propose...
the
authority
does
not
propose
any
standards
by
which
arbitrators
are
to
decide
when
to
stay
their
hands.
and
moreover,
if
the
arbitrators
do
not
stay
their
hands
in
the
discretionary
area,
there
can
indeed
be
review
by
the
federal
labor
relations
authority.
but
as
i've
stated,
it
is
questionable
whether...
it's
an
open
question
as
to
whether
there
can
be
any
judicial
review
beyond
that
point.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
that's
correct,
and
we
have
yet
another
variation
on
the
first
theory.
if
a-75
is
a
law...
and
of
course
we
don't
concede
that
it
is
a
law...
but
if
it
is
a
law,
we
say
that
it
is
not
an
applicable
law
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
and
the
reason
that
we
say
that
is
because
we
read
the
"in
accordance
with
applicable
laws"
language
to
give
unions
the
right
only
to
enforce
laws
that
have
rights
personal,
directly
personal,
to
the
employees.
if
you
read
the
phrase
"in
accordance
with
applicable
law"
more
broadly
than
that,
you
run
into
some
quite
anomalous
results,
and
respondents
do
not
explain
why
this
result
could
have
been
intended
by
congress.
they
wouldn't
draw
any
lines.
they
would
say
"in
accordance
with
applicable
law"
means
that
so
long
as
the
agency's
action
is
constrained
by
some
law
somewhere,
and
so
long
as
the
agency's
action
has
some
effect
on
employees
somehow,
then
there
can
be
review
or
the
unions
can
enforce
that
law.
but
to
just
give
a
hypothetical
of
why
that
reads
"in
accordance
with
applicable
laws"
much
too
broadly,
suppose
congress
instructs
the
forest
service
to
give
priority
to
fire
prevention,
and
suppose
that
the
forest
service
then
decides
that
it
should
conduct
a
reduction
in
force
and
some
forest
service
personnel
are
included
in
that
reduction
in
force.
the
authority's
construction,
the
respondent's
construction,
would
seem
to
allow
the
union
to
come
in
and
argue
that
the
reduction
in
force
was
not
in
accordance
with
applicable
law
because
congress
had
indicated
that
fire
prevention
was
a
priority.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
that's
correct,
it
would
be
decided
by--
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
--that's
right,
it
would
be
decided
by
an
arbitrator.
so
that
their
construction
really
leads
to
the
conclusion
or
would
suggest
that
congress
intended
to
create
very
broad
private
rights
of
action
for
union
employees.
but
this
court
has
held
that
private
rights
of
action
should
be
inferred
only
when
congress
has
intended
to
create
such
remedies,
and
there
is
no
indication
of
a
congressional
intent
here
to
create
such
broad
rights
of
action.
to
give
the
unions
this
kind
of
broad
right
of
action
would
create
a
great
disparity,
as
i've
suggested
before,
between
union
and
non-union
employees
in
terms
of
the
type
of
statutes
that
they
can
seek
to
enforce.
and
as
i
say,
there's
no
evidence
congress
intended
this.
what
we
can
glean
from
the
legislative
history
is
that
congress
intended
to
take
traditional
personnel
decisions
that
either
union
on
non-union
employees
could
bring
under
the
old
executive
order
regime
and
to
give
unions
the
ability
to
take
these
kinds
of
rights
and
raise
them
through
the
grievance
proceedings.
the
broad
interpretation
that
the
respondents
would
give
to
the
7106
subsection
(a)(1).
to
look
at
the
structure
of
the
statute,
subsection
(a)(1)
management
rights,
which
are
the
right
of
the
agency
to
control
the
mission
and
the
budget
and
the
number
of
employees
of
the
agency,
is
not
constrained
by
the
"in
accordance
with
applicable
law"
phrase.
in
other
words,
the
agency
insofar
as
the
union
is
concerned
does
not
have
to
act
in
accordance
with
applicable
laws
in
setting
the
mission
of
the
agency.
but
the
respondent's
interpretation
of
(a)(2)
that
would
reach
just
the
same
result
that's
precluded
under
subsection
(a)(1).
this
is
rather
difficult,
but
let
me
try
and
give
a
hypothetical.
under
subsection
(a)(2),
under
the
respondent's
theory,
the
union
can
require
that
layoffs
comply
with
applicable
law.
but
under
their
reading
they
might
be
able,
for
example,
to
argue
that
the
forest
service
was
not
complying
with
congress'
fire
prevention
priorities
when
it
laid
off
people
in
the
fire
prevention
area.
but
in
fact,
this
kind
of
challenge
would
be
exactly
the
sort
of
challenge
that
(a)(1)
does
not
permit.
it
would
be
a
challenge
to
the
mission
of
the
agency.
so
that
while
the
respondents
try
to
suggest
that
they
have
a
coherent
interpretation
of
the
statute
as
a
whole,
in
fact
their
interpretation
does
conflict
one
part
of
a
statute
with
another,
and
it
also
tries
to
read
out
certain
parts
of
the
statute.
for
example,
it
does
not
give
any
effect
to
the
language
saying
"nothing
in
this
chapter
shall
effect.
"
it
reads
that
right
out
of
the
statute.
to
go
back
again
to
mission,
particularly
with
regard
to
a-76
and
the
consequences
that
will
flow
if
arbitral
review
of
a-76
decisions
is
permitted.
these
decisions,
if
permitted...
that
is,
if
arbitral
review
is
allowed...
will
inevitably
interfere
with
management's
authority
to
contract
out,
because
every
aspect
of
circular
a-76
involves
matters
of
agency
discretion.
one
of
the
chief
reasons
why
courts
have
declined
under
the
apa
to
review
compliance
with
a-76
is
that
it
lacks
meaningful
standards
by
which
to
judge
an
agency's
exercise
of
discretion.
and
to
give
just
one
example
of
the
kind
of
discretionary
judgments
that
are
involved
in
an
agency's
carrying
out
circular
a-76,
when
the
cost
comparison
is
done
by
the
agency
it
is
premised
on
a
management
study
that
the
agency
has
to
conduct
to
determine
the
most
efficient
composition
by
which
the
agency
could
perform
the
function,
so
that
already
you
have
an
element
of
estimation,
an
element
of
exercise
of
agency
judgment,
in
just
determining
what
the
in-house
cost
comparison
is
to
be
based
on.
the
circular
then
goes
on
to
say
that,
in
determining
personnel
costs,
one
makes
a
staffing
estimate
that
also
is
cabined
by
the
tools,
judgmental
tools,
that
the
agency
is
to
use.
and
as
i've
mentioned
before,
even
the
authority
admits
that
this
kind
of
arbitral
review
for
compliance
with
a-76
will
at
least
sometimes
impinge
on
agency
discretion.
but
again,
the
solution
that
they
offer
is
a
clearly
inadequate
one
of
just
the
hope
that
arbitrators
will
stay
their
hands
when
they
get
into
somehow
the
fine
discretionary
area.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
at
this
time
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
i'd
just
like
to
make
one
point
briefly,
if
i
may.
of
course,
it
is
our
submission
that
7106
states...
or
applies
not
only
to
negotiability,
but
also
to
the
grievance
procedure,
so
that
the
reason
why
we're
debating
here
whether
a-76
is
a
law
or
not
is
because
7106
constrains
not
only
negotiability,
but
also

ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
--well,
i'm
glad
you
asked
that
question,
because
it
does
raise
the
question
of
agency
deference.
and
number
one,
we
do
say
that
their
construction
is
just
simply
contrary
to
the
statute,
and
that
is
something
that
this
court,
even
giving
deference,
can't
accept.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
well,
but
also
the
agency
has
not
been
consistent
in
its
interpretation,
and
i
think--
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
--well,
but
it
is
on
this
very--
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
--well,
it
is
unusual
for
us
to
be
arguing
against
agency
deference
here.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
well,
and
indeed,
as
to
the
interpretation
of
a-76,
it
should
be
the
interpretation
of
the
office
of
management
and
budget
that
should
prevail.
but
on
the
issue
of
whether
7106
applies
to
grievances,
the
authority's
own
decisions
have
held...
and
i
might
just
cite
afge
local
1968
and
department
of
transportation,
a
1981
decision.
that
decision
and
others,
the
patco
decision,
have
held
that
whenever
a
proposal
for
negotiation
creates
a
possibility,
ever
a
possibility,
that
an
arbitrator
will
second
guess
the
agency's
management
discretion,
the
result
should
be
that
there
should
be
no
negotiation
over
that
proposal,
as
well
as
ultimately
no
grievances
may
be
brought
on
the
proposal.
for
those
reasons,
we
ask
that
the
court
reverse
the
decision
or
the
judgment
below.
