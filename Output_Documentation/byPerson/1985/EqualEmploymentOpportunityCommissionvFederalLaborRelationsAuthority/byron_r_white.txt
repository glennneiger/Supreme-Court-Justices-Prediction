justice
byron
r.
white
well,
be
a
little
more
concrete.
the
kind
of
a
grievance
that
would
be
filed
is
that
when
there's
a
proposal
to
contract
out
the
union
would
grieve
and
say
that
you're
not
following
the
right
procedures
and
you
must
not
do
this
until
you
do;
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
the
arbitrator
agreed
with
then,
the
contracting
out
would
be
interfered
with,
i
gather?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
would
it
be
pertinent?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
said
that
would
be
pertinent.
why
would
it
be
pertinent?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
authority's
position
is
that
any
applicable
rule
or
regulation
is
grievable?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
because
of
the
definition
of
a
grievance
in
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
it
says
that
management
will
abide
by
all
rules
and
regulations?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
a
grievance...
under
this
scheme,
grievances
are
not
limited
to
construing
and
applying
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
in
the
statutory
definition?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have...
does
the
agency
have
authority
to
issue
regulations
to
implement
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
do
you
call
the
statute,
the
federal
labor
relations
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
feel...
and
is
it
clear
that
the
agency
is
entrusted
with
the
enforcement
of
that
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
construe
the
language
of
the
statute
to
apply
to
a
situation
like
this,
whether
this
is
a
law
or
whether
it
isn't
for
another
purpose?
you
would
say
it
nevertheless
is
enough
of
a
government
regulation
to
be
grievable
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
why
should
be
debate
some
abstract
thing
like
whether
this
presidential
directive
is
a
"law"
or
not?
why
don't
we
just
say,
ask
whether
it's
grievable
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
needn't
be
negotiable
to
be
grievable.
justice
byron
r.
white
to
make
it
negotiable,
don't
you
have
to
say
that
it's
a
law?
don't
you
have
to
win
on
that
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
about
the
meaning
of
the
contract.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
about
the
enforcement.
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
have
to
convince
us
that
the
agency's
interpretation
of
the
relevant
statute
if
just
contrary
to
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there's
just
not
any
room
for
their
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
have
to
convince
us
of
that,
don't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
a
lot
of
agencies
aren't
and
we
still
defer.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
office
frequently
asks
us
to.
