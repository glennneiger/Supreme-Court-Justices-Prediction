ms.
ruth
e.
peters
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
courts:
one
of
the
responsibilities
entrusted
to
the
federal
labor
relations
authority
by
congress
is
the
task
of
determining
the
negotiability
of
collective
bargaining
proposals
in
the
federal
sector.
this
case
arose
nearly
six
years
ago
now
when
afge
submitted
a
proposal
which
provided
that
petitioner
eeoc
agree
to
comply
with
omb
circular
a-76
and
other
applicable
laws
and
regulations
concerning
contracting
out.
the
authority
found
the
proposal
to
be
negotiable.
underlying
the
authority's
determination
are
three
basic
propositions
to
which
the
authority
has
adhered
since
the
first
days
of
its
enabling
statute,
the
first
proposition
here
being
that
the
statute
does
indeed
reserve
to
management
as
non-negotiable
the
substantive
exercise
in
accordance
with
applicable
laws
of
the
management
rights
enumerated
in
section
7105(a)(2);
however,
a
proposal
such
as
the
one
here
that
imposes
no
substantive
limitations
of
its
own
making,
that
simple
restates
management's
obligation
to
comply
with
applicable
legal
requirements
when
exercising
those
reserved
rights,
is
negotiable.
the
second
proposition
here
being
that
the
statute
in
the
federal
sector
defines
the
scope
of
the
negotiated
grievance
procedure.
thus,
even
in
the
absence
of
a
proposal
such
as
the
one
here,
with
or
without
such
a
proposal,
disputes
about
the
applications
of
laws,
rules,
and
regulations
such
as
the
circular,
affecting
conditions
of
employment,
are
within
the
scope
of
the
grievance
procedure
unless
the
parties
agree
through
negotiations
to
exclude
such
grievances.
the
final
proposition
here
is
likewise
rooted
in
the
notion
that
the
statute
prescribes
the
scope
and
the
coverage
of
a
negotiated
grievance
procedure
in
the
federal
sector.
thus,
no
government-wide
rule
or
regulation,
including
the
circular,
even
a
rule
or
regulation
purporting
to
address
the
permissible
scope
in
some
fashion
of
the
grievance
procedure,
may
be
applied
in
a
manner
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
scope
as
defined
by
this
act
of
congress.
having
stated
these
propositions,
i
would
also
like
to
note,
because
i
think
it
is
pertinent
to
an
understanding
of
this
case,
one
proposition
in
which
the
authority's
decision
takes
absolutely
no
root,
and
that
is
this
authority
decision
and
no
authority
decision
of
which
i
am
aware
either
is
based
upon
or
provides
any
support
for
the
notion
that
in
the
area
of
management's
reserved
rights
choices
of
policy
or
matters
of
discretion
that
management
reserves
to
itself
are
somehow
susceptible
to
the
bargaining
process
or
to
the
grievance
procedure.
an
examination
of
the
first
proposition,
that
proposals
such
as
the
one
here
are
negotiable,
demonstrates
the
faithfulness
of
the
authority
in
this
decision
to
the
text
of
the
statute
and
to
its
own
decisional
precedent.
the
statute
does
reserve
to
management
in
section
7106(a)(2),
along
with
other
rights,
the
non-negotiable
substantive
authority
to
make
determinations
with
respect
to
contracting
out.
the
authority
in
its
decisional
precedent
has
recognized,
respected,
and
effectuated
that
reservation
of
authority
to
management.
but
this
authority
reserved
to
management
is
not
unfettered.
by
the
literal
terms
of
the
statute,
that
authority
is
subject,
first
of
all,
to
the
negotiation
of
procedures
under
section
7106(b)(2)
and
appropriate
arrangements
under
section
7106(b)(3).
furthermore,
the
statute
expressly
provides
that
management's
contracting
out
authority,
as
well
as
the
other
enumerated
reserved
rights,
must
be
exercised
in
accordance
with
applicable
laws.
thus,
a
bargaining
proposal
like
this
one
is
not
rendered
non-negotiable
simply
because
it
mentions
a
reserved
right.
indeed,
in
a
long
line
of
decisional
precedent,
the
authority
has
consistently
found
to
be
negotiable
proposals
like
the
one
in
this
case,
proposals
that
impose
no
substantive
criteria
of
their
own
making,
but
instead
simply
restate
management's
obligation
to
act
in
accordance
with
applicable
laws.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
well,
i
would
note
that
it
was
published
for
notice
and
comment
in
the
federal
register,
and
that
even
petitioner
would
have
it
be
a
rule
or
regulation
within
the
meaning
of
section
7117.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
in
terms
of
section
7106,
i
think
that
a
natural
meaning
given
to
that
term
and
the
term
that
the
authority
has
given
to
the
term
"in
accordance
with
applicable
law"
means
applicable
legal
requirements.
and
certainly,
in
any
of
the
legal
criteria
that
apply
to
the
rights
there,
whether
it
be
contracting
out
or
discipline
or
promotions
or
work
assignments,
any
of
the
underlying
laws,
rules,
or
regulations
could
involve
expressions
of
executive
or
congressional
policy.
even
our
own
statute
and
most
congressional
enactments
have
some
policy
root.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
in
that
situation,
it
may
not
be.
whatever
checks
or
balances
or
review
there
would
be
of
such
a
procedure
probably
wouldn't
come
from
collective
bargaining
or
the
arbitration
process.
it
might
come
from
a
congressional
oversight
committee
or
the
public
at
large,
but
not
this
process.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
they
may
have
access
to
the
comptroller
general.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
well,
that
i
do
not
know.
the
precedent
that
exists
to
this
time
seems
to
me
either
to
be
based
upon
a
pre-1979
version
of
the
circular,
that
is
during
that
period,
or
based
upon
precedent
developed
in
that
period.
one
of
the
claims
court's
decisions
cited
by
afge
in
its
brief
suggests
at
4
claims
court
page
198...
and
it's
the
international
graphics
division
case...
that
the
post-1979
case,
local
2855
versus
brown,
that
relied
upon
previous
cases,
relied
upon
a
version
of
the
circular
in
1967
that
said
no
specific
standards
or
guidelines
are
set
present
for
determining
whether
cost
savings
justify
going,
contracting
rather
than
staying
in-house.
but
the
claims
court
suggests
that
the
vitality
of
this
aspect
of
that
case,
which
i
believe
is
an
eleventh
circuit
case,
was
diminished
by
the
replacement
in
1979
of
that
portion
of
the
circular
with
the
specific
and
detailed...
and
this
is
the
language
of
the
claims
court...
cost
comparison
handbook.
so
what
would
happen
now
in
litigation,
i
am
not
sure.
but
it
would
appear
that
disappointed
bidders
or
offerors
could
go
to
the
comptroller
general
under
certain
circumstances.
they
have
entertained
review
of
what
they
call
the
mandatory
procedures
set
forth
in
the
cost
comparison
handbook.
and
it
seems
to
me
that,
locking
at
the
comptroller
general
cases
cited
by
afge
in
its
brief,
that
when
a
disappointed
bidder
or
offeror
goes
there
that
the
comptroller
general
conducts
the
same
sort
of
analysis
that
occurs
under
arbitration
of
applicable
laws
in
our
program.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
well,
i'm
not
sure
conceptually
how
it
would
not
be
an
applicable
law,
first
of
all,
particularly
in
view
of
the
fact,
for
example,
that
omb
itself--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--in
my
view
and
in
the
authority's
view,
the
scope
of
the
grievance
procedure
is
defined
by
the
statutory
definition
of
"grievance",
and
the
statutory
definition
of
"grievance"
talks
about
matters,
first
of
all,
relating
to
the
employment
of
an
employee,
and
secondly
about
the
misapplication
of
laws,
rules,
or
regulations
affecting
conditions
of
employment.
so
even
if
it
weren't
a
law,
perhaps
a
question
of
whether
it's
a
government-wide
rule
or
regulation,
which
ever
petitioner
would
agree
it
is
under
section
7117,
would
be
pertinent.
there
are
perhaps
other
applicable
laws.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
pardon?
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
if
it
were
a
rule
or
a
regulation,
even
if
it
could
not
be
considered
a
law,
and
if
it
contained
some
mandatory
criteria--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--that
relates...
that
affects
conditions
of
employment.
of
course--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--that
is
correct.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
that
is
correct.
both
afge
and
nteu
indicated
in
their
briefs
to
this
court--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--that
is
correct,
under
our
statutory
scheme.
the
language
of
the
statute--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--yes,
it
is.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
our
statute?
yes,
we
do.
we
have
both
formal
and
rulemaking...
formal
and
informal
rulemaking
authority,
as
this
court
has
noted
in
batf.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
yes,
it's
called
the
federal
service
labor
management
relations
statute,
yes.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
of
our
statute,
yes.
we
are
an
independent
body
set
up
by
provisions
5
7101
through
7135--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--petitioner
has
found
it
to
be
a
government-wide
rule
or
regulation
within
the
meaning
of
section
7117
of
the
statute.
and
if
fact,
the
office
of
management
and
budget
extended
national
consultation
rights
to
unions
under
section
7117(d)(1)
of
the
statute,
which...
national
consultation
rights
are
extended--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--well,
that
would
i
think
be
the
pertinent
point.
this
is
of
course
a
negotiability
proceeding.
all
this
decides...
all
the
authority
decided
here
is
whether
this
proposal
is
negotiable.
and
in
response
to
the--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--that
is
correct.
but
the
authority's
theory
that
it
is
negotiable
is
because
it
places
no
substantive
limitations
of
its
own
making
upon
management's
rights.
and
the
issue
of
grievability
arose
when
the
authority
stated
in
its
decision
that
if
eeoc,
the
petitioner,
were
interpreting
this
as
somehow...
by
placing
this
in
the
contract--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--well,
in
our
view
it
is...
in
our
view,
the
natural
meaning
of
the
phrase
"in
accordance
with
applicable
laws"
means
applicable
legal
requirements.
many
of
those
requirements
may
be
discretionary,
and
they
would
not
be
susceptible
to
a
grievance
procedure.
in
the
area
of
management
rights,
essentially
management
holds
all
the
cards.
it
first
of
all
determines
the
underlying
policy.
for
example,
in
the
reduction
in
force
area
or
the
layoff
area,
which
is
a
reserved
management
right,
it
determines,
for
example,
whether
reductions
in
forces
are
preferable
to
furloughs,
and
it
also
determines
whether
reductions
in
force
should
be
based
upon
seniority
or
performance
or
some
combination
thereof.
having
established
policies,
it
also
chooses
the
criteria
by
itself,
without
grieving
or
bargaining,
upon
which
it
exercises
such
rights
and
effectuates
such
policies.
to
the
extent
that
it
chooses
discretionary
criteria
for
itself,
those
would
not
be
susceptible
to
the
grievance
procedure,
and
this
is
true
whether
it
is
contracting
out
or
layoff
or
discipline
or
any
of
the
reserved
management
rights.
but
to
the
extent
that
management
chooses
for
itself
mandatory
criteria
against
which
compliance
can
be
measured...
and
it
would
appear
that
the
comptroller
general
at
least
in
this
area
has
been
able
to
find
some
mandatory
criteria,
although
there
are
also
some
discretionary
ones
against
which
compliance
can
be
measured...
that
would
be
susceptible
to
the
grievance
procedure
to
the
extent
that
it
affects
conditions
of
employment.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
yes.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
that
is
correct.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
the
inclusion
of
this
in
the
contract
would
make
nothing
subject
to
the
grievance
procedure
which
is
not
already.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
both
nteu,
the
amicus,
and
afge,
our
respondent,
our
joint
respondent
here,
indicated
in
their
brief
to
this
court
that
it
is
simply
a
common
practice
in
the
federal
sector,
where
so
many
things
are
subject
to
law--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--it
is
what
we
are
litigating.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
for
putting
it
in
the
contract?
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
well,
of
course
simply...
it
is
in
line
with
long-established
precedent
to
find
this
negotiable.
this
is
not
the
first
time
that
the
authority
has
found
an
"in
accordance
with
applicable
laws"
provision
to
be
negotiable,
and
in
terms
of
ordering
them
to
bargain,
the
petitioner
can
say
that
it
does
not
want
such
a
provision
in
the
contract--
we
are
not
telling
them
to
agree
to
the
provision.
we're
simply
telling
them
to
bargain.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
yes.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
arbitration
only
would
view
mandatory
criteria
that
somehow
affect,
that
affect
conditions
of
employment.
that
is
the
extent
to
which
arbitration
is
involved
in
an
area
such
as
this
or
in
any
other
of
the
areas
reserved
to
management,
such
as
layoff
or
promotion,
for
example.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
yes.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
well,
the
arbitrator
would
look
at
something
and
see--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--the
statutory
agent
would
be
an
employing
agency,
and
it
would
have
one
view,
perhaps,
of
the
applicable
law.
the
arbitrator,
as
with
the
other
management
rights--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--under
the
statute,
the
express
terms
of
the
statute,
the
grievance
procedure
extends
to
misapplications
or
misinterpretations
or
violations
of
laws,
rules,
or
regulations,
and
that
would
include
laws,
government-wide
rules
or
regulations,
or
agency
regulations.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
yes,
in
our
view,
yes.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
that
is
correct,
yes.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
yes.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
i
don't
know
if
that's
what
the
petitioners
here
have
in
mind.
authority
precedent
makes
clear
that
it
doesn't
permit
that.
for
example,
in
the
lead
case
in
the
contracting
out
area
where
the
authority
protected
the
substantive
rights
of
management
to
choose
its
own
criteria
and
make
its
own
policy,
in
that
case,
nffe
local
1167,
the
proposal
simply
was
to
put
portions
of
the
circular
as
it
existed
into
the
contract,
and
the
authority
found
that
non-negotiable
because
it
would
bind
them
to
that
even
if
the
circular
changed.
but
a
proposal
such
as
this
in
the
authority's
view,
simply
"in
accordance
with
applicable
laws",
does
not,
because
management
retains
the
right
and
there
are
no
specific
provisions
of
the
circular
or
other
applicable
laws
in
the
contract,
so
that
management
can
change
those
during
the
life
of
the
contract
and
those
will
be
the
applicable
provisions
in
any
grievance
or
arbitration
or
in
any
other
way
that
they
affect
employees.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
yes.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
well,
we
are
an
independent
agency
and
we
are
an
adjudicatory--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--well,
we
are
here
as
respondents,
justice
marshall,
and
this
case
began
when
we
made
an
adjudication
of
a
negotiability
dispute.
the
petitioner
petitioned
for
review
and
the
d.c.
circuit--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--perhaps,
perhaps.
but
we
are
set
up
to
be
an
independent
agency
to
resolve
labor
disputes
within
the
federal
government.
and
in
the
words
of
judge
starr
of
the
d.c.
circuit,
we
are
set
up
to
favor
neither
management
nor
labor,
and
therefore
we
are
neutral,
we
are
independent,
and
our
adjudicatory
decisions
are
reviewed--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
that
is
correct.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
well,
the
statute
does
provide
precisely
for
judicial
review
in
the
courts
of
appeals
under
much
the
same
scheme
as
decisions
of
the
nlrb
are
subject
to
judicial
review
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
certainly.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
well,
the
statute
also
provides
in
its
definition
of
"grievance"
that
grievances
extend
to
disputes
over
collective...
provisions
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
so,
assuming
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
this
would
make
them
grievable,
putting
it
in
the
contract
would.
but
it
continues
to
be
our
position--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--that
is
correct.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
it
is
within
the
statutory
definition
of
"grievance".
it
expressly
refers
to
such
disputes
as
being--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--yes,
collective
bargaining
provisions.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
the
exact
provision
is
that:
"the
effect
or
interpretation
or
a
claim
of
breach
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
"
comes
within
the
statutory
definition
of
grievance.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
respectfully,
no,
justice
stevens.
this
is
no
different
from
any
of
the
other
government-wide
rules
or
regulations
that
govern
the
other
reserved
rights
of
management.
all
of
them
i
am
sure
contain
some
discretionary
aspects.
some
of
them
contain
some
mandatory
criteria
that
affect
conditions
of
employment.
it
is
the
authority's
long-established
precedent
in
the
way
that
it
treats
review
of
arbitration
awards
and
in
the
way
that
it
treats
other
portions
of
adjudicatory
responsibilities
that
only
the
mandatory
criteria
become
subject
to
the
grievance
procedure,
and
to
the
extent
that
they
affect
conditions
of
employment.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
well,
if
the
government
objects--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--it
certainly
is
not
a
burden
that
is
outside
the
contemplation
of
congress,
if
it
is
a
burden
at
all,
because
congress
made
such
matters
subject
to
the
grievance
procedure.
and
petitioner
and
other
employing
agencies
do
have
one
avenue.
the
exceptions
to
the
grievance
procedure
as
defined
by
statute
are
either
the
five
subjects
enumerated
in
the
statute...
there
are
five
subject
areas...
or
they
are
matters
that
the
pretties
themselves
agree
to
exclude
from
the
grievance
procedure
through
negotiations.
so
therefore,
petitioner
can
propose
during
collective
bargaining
negotiations
that
contracting
out
matters
or
any
other
matters
that
it
does
not
want
to
have
subject
to
the
grievance
procedure
be
excluded
from
the
broad
scope
of
the
grievance
procedure.
but
absent
such,
absent
such
negotiations
and
agreement
between
the
parties,
the
statutory
definition
is
quite
explicit
and
quite
express
in
its
breadth
and
in
terms
of
what
it
covers.
despite
the
fact
that
contracting
out
is
not
one
of
the
five
subjects
expressly
excluded
by
congress,
the
petitioner
has
contended
throughout
this
litigation
that
matters
concerning
contracting
out
are
not
grievable.
in
essence,
petitioner
has
argued
that
the
statute's
designation
of
a
subject
as
a
management
right
also
operates
to
preclude
the
subject
from
the
scope
of
the
grievance
procedure.
but
petitioner
acknowledges
to
this
court
that
grievances
over
discipline
and
promotions
are
permissible,
ever
though
discipline
and
promotions
are
reserved
management
rights.
but
petitioner's
reliance
on
the
phrase
in
section
7106
"nothing
in
this
chapter
shall
affect.
"
as
having
that
effect
of
removing
it
from
the
grievance
procedure
is
unavailing.
first
of
all,
if
they
were
correct
about
that
language
it
would
mean
that
even
discipline
and
promotions
were
not
grievable,
and
they
have
acknowledged
that
those
subjects
are
grievable.
furthermore,
relying
on
that
phrase
in
isolation
just
doesn't
take
into
account
the
"in
accordance
with
applicable
laws"
language
or
the
fact
that
the
statute
expressly
says
that
it
is
subject
to
procedures
and
appropriate
arrangements
bargaining.
and
of
course,
the
legislative
history
certainly
indicates
that
that
section
of
the
statute
is
meant
only
to
prohibit
bargaining
in
certain
respects
and
it
does
not
treat
the
grievability
of
matters.
petitioner
now
also
makes
the
argument
to
this
court
that,
even
if
it
were
somehow
coming
within
the
grievance
procedure,
it
nevertheless
should
be
excluded
because
contracting
out
determinations
bear
only
indirectly
on
the
employment
relationship.
but
of
course
there
are
any
number
of
indications
of
the
direct
effect
of
contracting
out
matters
on
the
bargaining
unit
employees,
and
that
contracting
out
affects
or
is
a
condition
of
employment.
among
these
indications
are
the
very
terms
of
the
circular,
which
since
1979
has
recognized
the
stake
that
employees
and
their
bargaining
representatives
have
in
contracting
out
by
providing
them
access
to
the
circular's
appeals
procedure
for
challenging
cost
comparisons.
the
circular,
i
would
note,
describes
its
appeals
procedure
as
a
mechanism
"intended
to
protect
the
rights
of
all
directly
affected
parties.
"
moreover,
the
circular
provides
that
employees
should
be
informed
about
the
undertaking
and
the
progress
of
cost
studies,
and
agency
regulations,
which
also
involve
grievable
matters
to
the
extent
that
they
impose
mandatory
criteria,
agency
regulation
such
as
the
air
force
and
army
regulations
referenced
in
afge's
bried
have
specific
provisions
about
employee
and
union
involvement
in
aspects
of
the
cost
study.
and
the
circular
itself
also
addresses
arrangements
for
employees
who
are
adversely
affected
by
the
conversion
to
contract
performance
of
services.
and
as
i
have
noted
before,
the
office
of
management
and
budget
extended
national
consultation
rights
over
the
circular
to
federal
sector
unions,
and
those
are
extended
with
regard
to
laws,
rules,
or
regulations...
excuse
me,
government-wide
regulations
affecting
any
substantive
change
in
any
condition
of
employment.
and
furthermore,
the
notion
that
congress
intended
to
exclude
contracting
out
matters
from
the
scope
of
the
grievance
procedure
doesn't
find
any
support
in
the
legislative
history
or
the
language.
and
to
the
extent
that
private
sector
precedent
provides
an
appropriate
analogy
for
our
program,
that
law
strongly
supports
the
status
of
contracting
out
as
a
condition
of
employment
and
of
its
susceptibility
to
the
grievance
procedure.
but
this
does
not
mean,
of
course,
to
say
that
anything,
no
matter
how
attenuated
its
relationship
or
effects
on
employment,
would
be
subject
to
the
grievance
procedure,
but
that
matters
such
as
this
are.
disputes
involving
contracting
out
determinations,
to
the
extent
that
they
affect...
excuse
me.
thank
you.
