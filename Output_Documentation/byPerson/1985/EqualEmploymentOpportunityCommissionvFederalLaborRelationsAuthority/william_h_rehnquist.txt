william
h.
rehnquist
well,
under
the
union's
theory,
would
that
then
be
decided
by
an
arbitrator?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
whether
the
fire
service...
forest
service
was
laying
off
the
right
people?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
a
director
of
omb,
instead
of
issuing
a
circular,
had
simply
called
in
the
administrative
officers
of
all
the
agencies
and
departments
and
said:
look,
i'm
going
to
tell
you
now
how
we're
going
to
handle
contracting
out,
and
he
told
them
maybe
in
15
minutes
or
a
half
an
hour
what
the
substance
of
this
circular.
and
they
took
notes
and
then
went
back
and
said:
all
right,
here's
how
we're
told
to
handle
contracting
out.
now,
is
that
an
applicable
law
under
the
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
a
third
party
interested
in
contracting
out
were
to
try
to
litigate
the
question
of
whether
eeoc
had
properly
complied
with
the
omb
directive?
do
you
think
it
could
bring
a
lawsuit
saying,
look,
you
didn't
follow
the
omb
requirements
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think...
that
wouldn't
be
a
lawsuit.
do
you
think
they
could
bring
a
lawsuit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
peters--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--did
the
agency
interpret
the
proposal
with
respect
to
circular
a-76
to
mean
that,
if
it
were
agreed
to
or
otherwise
came
into
effect,
that
the
provisions
of
circular
a-76
as
it
then
stood
would
bind
eeoc
as
to
the
employees,
even
though
omb
were
to
change
the
circular?
