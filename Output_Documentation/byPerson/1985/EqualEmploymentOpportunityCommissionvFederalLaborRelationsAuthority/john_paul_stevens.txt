ms.
peters,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
at
this
point?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
true
whether
or
not
this
provision
is
included
in
the
contract
under
your
submission?
justice
john
paul
stevens
under
your
submission,
would
the
inclusion
of
this
provision
in
the
contract
make
anything
subject
to
the
grievance
procedure
that
would
not
already
be
subject
to
the
grievance
procedure?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
why
is
it
so
important
to
the
union
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
worth
litigating
about?
i'm
just
wondering.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
worth
all
the
time
if
it
really
doesn't
make
any
difference,
if
it's
customary
to
do
it?
is
that
really
a
sufficient
reason?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
if
you
have
the
same
rights
without
it.
or
for
ordering
them
to
bargain,
if
it
isn't
important.
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
least
it
would
make
the
contract
shorter
if
you
left
the
provision
out.
and
bargaining
much
shorter.
i'm
not
sure
i've
got
your
point
in
some
of
these
colloquies.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
the
other
side
of
the
question
i
asked
a
little
bit
ago.
justice
john
paul
stevens
assume
for
just
purposes
of
argument
that
apart
from
the
agreement
that
questions
of
this
kind
would
not
be
grievable.
would
the
inclusion
of
this
clause
make
them
grievable
if
they
otherwise
were
not
grievable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
position
is
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
your
opponent's
position,
of
course,
is
that
it's
critical.
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
well,
it
certainly
would
be
grievable
if
you
put
it
in
the
contract,
wouldn't
it?
i
mean,
somebody
raised
an
issue
about
what
it
meant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
doesn't
it
follow
that
if
some
disputes
under
the
meaning
of
the
circular
a-76
are
now
grievable
and
some
are
not,
because
there
are
always
different
kinds
of
disputes,
putting
this
provision
in
the
contract
would
make
everything
grievable?
it
would
expand
the...
wouldn't
it
necessarily
expand
the
subjects
that
would
be
grievable?
