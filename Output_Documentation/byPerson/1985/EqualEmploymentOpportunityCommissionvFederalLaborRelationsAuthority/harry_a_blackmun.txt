counsel,
is
the
circular
reproduced
in
your
brief
any
there?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
it
very
long?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes,
but
that
isn't
the
full
circular.
that's
the
circular
plus
the
appendices,
is
it
not?
i'm
a
little
surprised
that
neither
side
has
seen
fit
to
produce
the
circular
in
any
papers
that
are
filed
here
for
the
court
to
consider
at
the
bench.
i
happen
to
have
it,
but
i
just
wondered
why
not.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it's
all
of
ten
pages,
eleven
maybe.
