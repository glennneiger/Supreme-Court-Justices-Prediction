well,
ms.
kuhl,
suppose
that
we
agreed
that
the
circular
is
not
a
law
for
purposes
of
section
7106.
does
that
end
the
case,
or
do
we
still
have
to
determine
whether
non-compliance
with
the
circular
is
the
subject
of
a
grievance
under
the
act
notwithstanding
whether
it's
included
in
a
collective
bargaining
agreement?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
the
inquiry?
if
you
say
it's
not
a
law
under
7106?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
your
opponent
says
it
doesn't,
because
in
any
event
it's
grievable
under
the
act.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
take
it,
though,
that
you
take
the
position
that
under
section
7117(a)(1)--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
circular
is
a
rule
or
regulation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
effect
would
the
proposal
have
on
management
rights,
other
than
an
effect
on
grievance
and
arbitration
procedures?
would
there
be
any
other
effect?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
not
the
union's.
the
union's?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
just
wonder
what
effect
it
would
have
other
than
on
grievance
and
arbitration.
if
it
has
one,
i
haven't
heard.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
is...
you
agree
that
it
would
have
no
effect
other
than
on
grievance
and
arbitration
procedures?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
other
side
takes
the
position
that
the
act
requires
that
these
matters
be
subject
to
grievance
and
arbitration
anyway.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
take
it
you
submit
alternative
theories
by
which
you
could
prevail,
the
theory
that
7106
ends
the
inquiry
if
the
circular
is
not
a
law
or
the
theory
that
7117(a)(1)
ends
the
case
if
we
say
it's
a
rule
or
regulation
that's
inconsistent.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
is
a
little
difficult
to
conceive
of
a
policy
circular
like
this
as
being
a
law,
though,
isn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
not
necessarily
a
law.
i
think
it
is
somewhat
conceptually
difficult
to
think
of
this
circular
as
being
a
law.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
ms.
peters,
suppose
we
disagree
with
you
and
think
the
circular
isn't
a
law
under
the
terminology
of
section
7106.
does
that
end
the
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
just
suppose
that
we
disagree
with
you
and
think
it's
not.
does
that
end
the
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
a
little
troubled
by
that
statement,
because
i
suppose
it
gets
back
to
what
the
chief
justice
was
asking.
you
have
to
go
through
grievance
and
arbitration
to
determine
whether
the
agency
discretion
will
be
allowed
or
not.
it's
going
through
the
process
to
which
the
government
objects,
i
guess.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
is
your
position
that
that
is
not
a
burden;
let
them
go
through
the
process,
and
at
the
end
of
the
line
the
arbitrator
will
say:
well,
that's
subject
to
agency
discretion,
so
the
government
wins...
i
mean,
the
agency
wins.
