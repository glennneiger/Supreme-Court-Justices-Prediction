is
it
your

accordance
with
applicable
law"
means
that
they
conduct
an
arbitration
to
decide
what
that
means,
what
is
applicable
law?

warren
e.
burger
well,
i'm
still
not
sure
i
have
your
answer.
whe
decides--
chief
justice

e.
burger
--whether
something

burger
you
mean
the
arbitrator
and
not
the
agency,
not
the
statutory
agent
that's
engaging
in
the
contracting
out?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you're
saying
that
must
be
arbitrated?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
includes--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

position

justice

do
you
have
anything
further,
ms.
kuhl?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
there
something
of
a
little
bit
of
reciprocal
deference
involved
here,
too?
two
agencies?

justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
