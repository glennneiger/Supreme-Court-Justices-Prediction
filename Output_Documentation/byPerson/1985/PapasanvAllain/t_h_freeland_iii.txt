mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
there
is
a
line
drawn
across
the
state
of
mississippi,
an
arbitrary
line
that
divides
the
school
children
of
that
state
into
two
classes.
the
school
children
in
the
southern
59
counties
of
mississippi
receive
the
entire
income
from
the
federally
created
school
lands
trust
in
our
state,
while
the
school
children
in
the
chickasaw
cession,
the
23
counties
that
we
represent,
receive
not
a
nickel
of
this
trust
income,
but
instead
a
pittance
in
the
form
of
an
annual
appropriation
which
the
mississippi
legislature
may
or
may
not
make
each
year.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
i
think
it
is
contrary
to
federal
law,
justice
white,
for
them
to
do
as
they
are
doing.
in
other
words--
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
--i
think
it
is
contrary...
yes,
to
answer
your
question
in
a
word.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
i
think
that
they
could
do
that
as
part
of
the
relief
that
we
seek,
yes.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
not
precisely.
what
i
said
was
that
it
is
contrary
to
federal
law
to
allow
all
of
the
trust
income
to
go
to
59
counties,
and
at
the
same
time
none
of
it
to
go
to
the
23
that
we
represent.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
well,
in
the
first
place--
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
--yes,
yes,
indeed,
it
would
be,
and
that
is
the
situation
that
does
in
fact
exist
in
lots
of
state,
where
the
state
has
not
done--
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
--as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
language
of
the
trust
says
that
that
is
what
is
to
be...
in
other
words,
the
land
is
to
be
maintained
for
the
benefit
of
the
township
in
which
the
land
is
located,
but
we
have
gone
beyond
that
in
mississippi.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
that
is
my
point.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
no,
justice
powell,
that
is--
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
--that
is
incorrect.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
all
right.
what
happened
was
this.
first
of
all,
the
entire
school
lands
trust
was
created
at
one
time
in
1817
in
mississippi's
enabling
act
and
the
land
sales
act.
the
land
sales
act
provided
that
the
16
section
lands
were
to
be
retained
throughout
the
state
in
trust
for
the
schools.
then,
in
the
sale
of
the
lands
in
what
is
called
the
chickasaw
cession,
the
23
counties
that
we
represent,
rather
than
retain
the
lands
in
trust,
as
was
supposed
to
be
done,
they
sold
them
and
gave
the
money
to
the
indians,
and
not
to
the
state.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
that
is
correct,
and
of
course
the
united
states
government
realized
what
it
had
done,
subsequently
passed
a
statute
that
said,
we
are
going
to
give
the
state
177,555
acres
of
new
lands
to
replace
these
lands
that
we
wrongfully,
if
you
will,
sold
to
the
indians.
thereafter,
after
this
happened,
the
state
of
mississippi
first
leased
these
lands.
they
are
in
the
mississippi
delta,
some
of
the
richest
farmland
in
the
world.
they
leased
these
lands,
and
following
that,
the
congress
in
1852
passed
a
statute
that
said,
you
can
now
sell
the
lands
provided
you
retain
the
funds,
proceeds
of
the
sale
in
trust
for
the
schools,
or
as
an
alternative
you
can
lease
the
lands,
but
if
you
do,
if
you
do
sell
the
lands,
you
have
got
to
get
permission
of
the
counties
where...
that
would
benefit
from
the
lands
in
order
to
do
so.
of
course,
the
state
never
did
do
this.
in
1856,
the
state
comes
along.
they...
well,
first,
in
1854
they
gave
away
the
reversionary
interest
in
the
land.
they
had
the
lands
leased
for
99
years.
they
said,
we
will
give
you
a
fee
simple
title
for
no
additional
charge,
which
they
did.
this
was
delta
land.
subsequent
to
that,
in
1856,
the
state
said,
okay,
we
have
got
something
over
$1
million
in
a
fund
in
the
state
treasury.
they
by
statute
converted
that
to
the
use
of
the
state,
and
put
it
in
the
general
fund,
and
spent
it
just
like
they
would
any
other
money
in
the
general
fund.
in
other
words,
the
trustee
gave
away
the
corpus
of
the
trust
or
converted
it.
now,
the
same
statute
that
you
are
referring
to,
i
believe,
does
talk
about
lending
money
to
the
railroads,
a
highly
speculative
venture
in
mississippi
in
1856,
but
that
was
done
after
the
money
was
converted
to
the
use
of
the
state.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
no,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
you
read
the
statute,
i
believe
they
put
about
$400,000
of
it
into
the
railroads,
railroads,
incidentally,
that
had
no
rolling
stock,
had
not
been
built,
and
to
add
insult
to
injury,
they
were
in
south
mississippi,
not
in
north
mississippi
where
our
23
counties
are.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
until
this
day.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
certainly,
justice
o'connor.
i
certainly
hope
the
court
will
do
that.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
is
the
court
referring
to
general
appropriations
or
are
we
talking
about--
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
--aside
from
the
school
lands
trust.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
that
is
precisely
correct.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
may
i
illustrate
in
dollars?
in
dollars,
in
the
chickasaw
cession
63
cents
per
student,
moneys
in
lieu
of
trust
funds
prior
to
1985;
outside
the
chickasaw
cession,
$75
per
student.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
the
fund
represents
outside
the
chickasaw
cession
approximately
20
percent
of
the
total
school
funds
available
to
the
schools
in
the
state
of
mississippi.
this
is
outside
the
chickasaw
cession.
that
is
less
teachers'
salaries.
in
other
words,
these
are
basically
used
as
discretionary
funds.
so
if
you
discount
teachers'
salaries,
the
fund
represents
approximately
20
percent
of
the
total
school
funds
available
in
the
state
of
mississippi.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
i
believe
that's
correct.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
i
believe
that's
correct.
i'm
not
positive
of
that
answer,
but
i
believe
that's
correct.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
justice
blackmun,
that
is
precisely
our
complaint.
they
do
not.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
no,
they
certainly
do
not.
in
other
words,
against
60,
a
little
better
than
60
cents
per
pupil
in
the
chickasaw
cession
prior
to
'85;
in
the
rest
of
the
state,
$74.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
the
answer
is
the
same.
that
difference
is
not
made
up
with
these
other
funds.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
outside
the
chickasaw
cession.
that's
correct.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
no,
no,
no.
in
the
chickasaw
cession,
less
than
3
percent
because
of
the
amount
of
moneys
that
we
get.
in
other
words,
again,
you
are
talking
about
a
difference.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
it
is...
if
i
have
got
my
mathematics
correct,
justice
rehnquist,
it
is...
yes,
roughly,
i
would
say
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
it
is
our
position
that
the
lack
of
a
minimally
adequate
education,
and
as
the
court
understands,
we
are
here
on
a
12(b)(6)
motion,
is
the
effect
of
the
denial
of
the
rights
that
we
claim
under
this
trust,
and
not
the
cause.
the
cause,
we
say,
is
denial
of
these
rights
under
this
federally
created
trust.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
i
would
say
not,
the
state.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
yes.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
that,
i
believe,
is
true.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
average
daily
attendance
i
believe
is
the
basis.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
we
have
no
complaint
about
that.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
none
whatever.
that
is
not
the
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
i
am
not
positive
of
that
figure,
but
i
would
say
it
would
be
approximately
correct.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
in
the
south,
and
it
would
be
higher
than
that--
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
--the
3
percent
was
trying
to
compare
what
we
get
from
the
lieu
lands.
it
is
actually
less
than
that,
justice
white.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
the
percent
that
we
actually
get
from
the
state?
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
the
funding
is
basically
the
same.
how
we
break
it
down--
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
--well,
let
me
say
this
first.
we
are
not
attacking
school
funding
in
mississippi
as
a
general
proposition.
that
is
not
our
lawsuit
as
we
view
it.
our
lawsuit
as
we
view
it
is
simply
this
trust
created
by
the
federal
government
is
being
violated
because
our
clients,
or
the
schools
that
they
attend,
i
should
say,
are
not
getting
their
rightful
share
of
the
trust
income.
that
is
the
basis
for
our
lawsuit.
now,
as
far
as
the
overall
school
funding
of
the
state
of
mississippi
is
concerned,
we
are
not...
that
is
not
the
thrust
of
our
lawsuit
in
the
least.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
not
the
violation
that
we
are
suing
on.
now,
justice
rehnquist.
the
violation
that
we
are
suing
on
is
the
violation
that
occurs
each
year
when
this
trustee,
who
either
converted
the
trust
corpus
or
gave
it
away,
and
owes
us
a
continuing
duty.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
this
court
has
said
that
where
there
is
a
trust
and
the
trustee
converts
the
corpus
of
the
trust,
and
thereafter
continues
to
admit,
as
the
state
of
mississippi
has
done
in
this
situation,
that
the
duty
is
owed
to
continue
paying
income,
that
the
statute
of
limitations
doesn't
run.
the
only
way
the
statute
commenced
to
run
is
if
the
trustee
repudiates
the
trust,
which
the
trustee
didn't
do.
it
didn't
say
the
trust
was
void--
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
--that
is
another
point.
there
is
no
substitute
fund.
it
is
entirely
mythical.
the
fund
of
something
over
$1
million
was
arrived
at
simply
by
taking
177,555
acres
and
multiplying
it
by
$6.
the
fund
doesn't
exist
and
has
not
existed
since
1856.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
for
years
they
appropriated
first
8
percent,
starting
with
'56,
then
they
dropped
it
to
7,
and
then
in
the
constitution
of
1890
they
dropped
it
to
6
percent,
which
amounted
to
something
over
$60,000
per
annum
to
be
divided
amongst
23
counties,
and
then
in
1984
they
came
back
again
and
said,
we
know
we
have
violated
this
trust.
we
know
we
should
do
something
about
it.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
the
state
of
mississippi
would
like
to...
i
hope
this
is
the
last
occasion
on
which
any
state
official
from
mississippi
uses
the
civil
war
as
an
excuse
for
some
of
their
wrongdoing.
0
[generallaughter.]
they
do
it
every
time.
you
would
think,
you
know,
after
all
these
years,
but
here
they
are
again,
and
they
say
the
civil
war
had
no
more
to
do
with
this...
the
money
was
converted
in
1856,
before
the
civil
war
ever
occurred.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
absolutely
not.
we
are
asking--
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
--that,
though,
is
the
fault
of
the
state,
the
trustee
and
the
state
officials
who
are
acting
as
trustees,
and
where
a
trustee
does
that
the
law
of
trust
places
the
trustee
under
a
very
specific
obligation.
ha
is
under
a
continuing
duty,
a
trustee
is,
to
pay
income
for
the
trust
intended
purpose,
and
the
purpose
of
this
was
to
educate
children.
the
way
he
has
converted
the
trust
corpus,
the
trustee
has
to
continue
paying
income
after
the
conversion.
the
trustee's
duty
to
pay
income
continues
in
that
if
recurs
annually,
and
each
time,
each
year
that
rolls
around
and
he
doesn't
pay
the
income
he
should
it
is
another
violation,
and
that
is
why
we
are
suing
to
stop
these
annual
recurring
violations.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
the
record
does
not.
there
is
a
statement
made
in
the
attorney
general's
brief
which
is
entirely
outside
the
record
that
my
home
county
had
high
test
scores.
well,
it
also
happens
to
be
the
seat
of
the
university
of
mississippi,
for
what
that
is
worth.
it
doesn't
show,
for
example,
what
the
records
are
in
mr.
papasan's
home
county,
tunica
county,
where--
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
--because,
justice
powell,
this
case
is
here
on
a
12(b)(6)
motion,
and
that
is
our
allegation,
and
for
purposes
of
this
argument--
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
--the
fact
that
we
allege
is
that
this
is
the
result
of
the
denial.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
well,
let's
say
at
the
minimum
it
would
be
something
that
would
raise
the
pupil
above
the
level
of
a
functional
illiterate,
and
we
literally
have
schools
in
mississippi
where
they
are
being
denied
even
that,
and
a
lot
of
them
are
not...
tunica
county,...
i
keep
going
back
to
that.
the
poorest
county
in
the
whole
united
states.
the
only
poorer
place
in
the
whole
country
is
the
leper
colony
on
molokai.
the
point,
though,
of
the
matter
is
that
here
we
are
dealing
with
a
federally
created
trust.
we
are
not
just
dealing
with
appropriations
of
school
money
for
the
state
of
mississippi.
we
are
dealing
with
a
trust
created
by
the
federal
government.
we
are
dealing
with
a
trust
that
the
state
admits
it
has
violated
over
these
years
and
has
continued
to
violate,
and
it
comes
down
to
this,
to
say
that
a
suit
such
as
we
have
here
on
the
basis
of
this
continuing
violation
is
barred
by
the
eleventh
amendment,
and
that
is
the
state's
primary
argument,
is
to
say
that
there
is
no
trust
at
all.
there
is
no
continuing
duty
at
all,
in
other
words.
if
there
is
a
trust,
there
is
a
continuing
duty.
now,
of
course,
this
court
has
repeatedly
and
recently
upheld
the
school
lands
trusts,
in
lassen
versus
arizona,
arizona...
alamo
land
and
cattle
company
versus
arizona.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
lassen...
alamo
did
not.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
it
came
up
through
the
federal
courts.
there
are
other
cases
that
the
court,
like
united
states
versus
ervine,
that
did
come
up
through
the
federal
court
system,
where
in
fact
the
united
states
was
seeking
to
enforce
the
provision
of
the
trust
and
the
states
were
arguing
there
was
no
trust
here
at
all.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
and
we
submit,
justice
rehnquist,
the
eleventh
amendment
is
no
bar
to
prospective
injunctive
relief,
which
tells
these
trustees
to
cease
violating
the
terms
of
this
trust
in
the
future,
to
do
your
duty
in
the
future,
and
that
is
what
we
are
asking
here.
of
course,
we
don't...
the
entire
thrust
of
our
case
is
not
just
the
trust.
assuming
arguendo
there
is
no
trust,
we
still
say
that
the
way
these
schools
are
being
financed
has
no
rational
basis
whatsoever.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
yes,
it
certainly
is.
what
is
the
basis
for
it?
well,
an
accident
of
land
value
is
a
basis,
the
state
says.
there
is
no
land
to
put
a
value
on
in
north
mississippi.
they
are
trying
to
make
a
rodriguez
argument.
we
want
to
have
local
administration
of
local
schools.
that
is
the
basis
for
it.
there
is
no
school
lands
trust
to
administer
in
northern
mississippi.
the
state
either
gave
it
away
or
took
it.
contrast
this
case
with
rodriguez.
for
example,
there
you
have
a
facially
neutral
situation.
you
do
have
a
difference
in
land
values.
it
is
just
one
section
of
san
antonio
had
a
higher
value
of
land
than
another.
here
we
have
a
discriminatory
act
the
way
this
money
is
divided
up
and
no
basis
for
it.
the
relief
that
we
seek
is
simple
enough,
an
adjudication
that
the
trust
is
valid,
that
it
is
governed
by
federal
law,
that
it
is
violated
annually
by
the
respondent
state
officials,
and
that
it
the
recurring
violations
are
a
derogation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
as
well
as
the
contracts
clause
of
the
constitution.
we
seek
prospective
injunctive
relief
to
stop
these
trustees
from
doing
what
they
have
been
doing
with
these
kids
in
the
future,
to
give
them
a
chance,
and
see
that
their
schools
receive
the
support
for
which
the
trust
was
created
in
the
first
place,
and
which
is
now
being
denied.
what
we
say
about
this
trust
is
certainly
consistent
with
the
decisions
of
this
court
dealing
with
school
lands
trusts
generally.
for
example,
we
are
asking
the
court
to
apply
certain
common
law
principles
to
this
situation
just
as
the
court
did
in
oneida
ii.
there
you
had
a
trust
created
by
the
non-intercourse
act
of
1793,
and
the
court
said,
well,
we
don't
have
any
law
to
look
to
here,
there
was
no
regulatory
scheme
for
enforcing
the
trust,
so
we
are
going
to
apply
common
law
principles.
these
same
principles
apply
here.
we
are
asking
this
court
to
declare
that
this
is
in
fact
the
trust,
something
that
the
court
has
done
each
and
every
time
it
has
ever
had
an
opportunity
to
rule
on
the
question,
and
that
the
law
governing
the
trust,
because
it
is
created
by
federal
law,
is,
of
course,
federal
law,
and
the
trust
is
enforceable.
in
other
words,
the
short
answer
to
what
we
want
is
for
the
trustees
to
honor
their
obligations
in
the
future.
to
argue,
as
the
state
does,
that
the
eleventh
amendment
bars
any
such
remedy
or
the
trustee's
diminution
of
the
trust
corpus
is
to
say
that
there
is
no
trust
at
all,
contrary
to
the
statutes
which
created
it,
that
there
is
no
enforceable
continuing
duty,
nothing
that
can
be
enforced
in
federal
court,
that
any
claim
under
federal
law
would
have
to
be
left
to
the
tender
mercies
of
the
state
court.
the
fifth
circuit's
holding
is
nothing
less
than
that
this
trust
is
simply
not
there
because
they
said
there
is
no
continuing
duty.
granted,
says
the
fifth
circuit,
there
was
a
valid
compact
created
130
years
ago.
what
we
are
looking
at
now
is
some
weird
creature
that
has
to
do
with
mississippi
trust
law,
and
they
flatly
refuse
to
enforce
the
continuing
duty,
and
really
that
is
what
this
lawsuit
is
about.
if
this
is
a
trust,
and
we
certainly
contend
that
it
is,
the
it
follows
as
the
night
the
day
that
the
trustees
of
this
trust,
and
those
are
the
people
that
we
are
suing,
are
obliged
to
honor
it,
and
as
part
of
that
they
are
obliged
to
pay
or
see
that
the
trust
income
is
properly
divided
or
paid
in
the
future
from
some
source,
and
they
can
be
made
to
do
that
because
they
are
acting
in
derogation
of
federal
law
and
they
are
acting
in
derogation
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
we
submit
that
they
could
be
made
to
do
that
by
this
court,
and
that
indeed
they
should
be
made
to
do
that
by
this
court.
are
there
any
other
questions?
may
i
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time?
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
counsel
says
that
there
are
school
districts
in
the
state
of
mississippi
that
get
no
16th
section
land
money.
that
may
be.
i
would
like,
though,
to
refer
the
court,
if
i
may,
to
joint
appendix
45,
where
the
secretary
of
state
points
out
precisely
how
much
moneys
are
received
from
the
trust
by
the
various
counties
in
the
state
of
mississippi.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
counties
and
school
districts.
i
am
using
them
synonymous,
justice
white,
because
that
is
the
way
the
money
is
divided
up.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
under
the
supervisor
of
the
secretary
of
state.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
no,
it
is
paid
to
the
county
school
board
as
it
now
stands.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
school
districts.
yes,
sir.
that's
correct.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
absolutely,
and
that
is
the
point
also
as
to
meridian,
for
example.
what
happened
with
that
16th
section
land,
it
was
sold,
and
the
money
is
held
in
trust,
and
they
get
the
income
from
the
trust.
so,
to
say
that
they
are
not
getting
any
income
from
16th
section
lands
of
the
trust
begs
the
question.
they
still
are,
and
our
complaint
is
that
we
are
not,
and
that
is
what
this
lawsuit
is
about.
it
is
about
the
trust.
it
is
not
about
how
the
state
of
mississippi
funds
its
schools
around
the
state.
they
do
that
on
more
or
less
an
equal
basis,
and
that
is
another
basis
for
our
complaint,
however.
how
is
it
that
they
can
give
everybody
the
same
amount
of
state
money,
and
yet
acting
as
trustees
of
the
trust
give
us
not
one
nickel
of
the
trust
income
and
say
that
they
are
treating
us
on
any
sort
of
rational,
reasonable
basis?
and
then
they
point
at
rodriguez
and
say,
well,
there
wasn't
any
discrimination
in
rodriguez.
of
course
there
wasn't.
the
case
was
tried,
and
that
is
what
the
trial
court
found,
that
the
scheme
in
rodriguez
was
facially
neutral,
but
of
course
we
allege
here
that
we
are
dealing
with
rank
discrimination,
and
that
is
what
the
pleadings
have
to
say.
the
eleventh
amendment,
we
contend
that
this
claim
concerns
only
continuing
violations
of
federal
statutory
and
constitutional
law,
and
it
falls
therefore
within
the
rules
permitting
suits
alleging
conduct
contrary
to
the
supreme
authority
of
the
united
states,
as
this
court
mentioned
in
penhurst,
or
it
said
in
green
versus
mansour,
a
recent
opinion,
that
such
prospective
relief
as
we
are
looking
for
vindicates
the
authority
of
the
united
states,
and
that
is
all
we
ask.
we
ask
that
this
trust
be
enforced.
we
don't
ask
the
court
to
interfere
with
the
way
schools
are
funded
in
mississippi.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
i
do
indeed.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
if
there
is
no
trust.
precisely.
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
then
what
they
are
doing
is
totally
irrational,
because
they
are
giving
$75
or
$74
a
pupil
in
59
counties,
and
at
the
same
time
they
are
giving
63
cents
a
pupil
in
the
rest
of
the--
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
--i
would
rather
have
you
find
that
there
is
a
trust,
your
honor,
because
just
as
the
court
has
done
in--
mr.
t.
h.
freeland,
iii
--i
am
arguing
that
i
have
got
a
two-way
street
here.
not
only
do
we
have
the
trust,
which
this
court
has
repeatedly
upheld
in
andres,
lassen,
alamo
land
and
cattle,
more
cases
than
i
can
name,
but
also
that
the
scheme
that
the
state
has
set
up
is
so
totally
irrational
that
we
also
have
an
equal
protection
claim
which
we
press.
