mr.
arnold,
could
i
ask
a
question
right
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
i
understand
it,
the
discrepancy
with
regard
to
the
trust
fund
income
is
the
difference
between
63
cents
and
$75
per
pupil,
and
as
i
understand
what
you
are
saying
now,
the
additional
money
supplied
by
the
state
of
mississippi
are
the
same
per
pupil,
whether
it
is
$50
or--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so
the
discrepancy
between
$75
and
63
cents,
although
it
would
be
a
different
percentage,
in
absolute
dollars
is
the
same
percentage
after
you
add
in
the
mississippi
supplemental
fund.
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
they
are
a
little
off.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
$2
million
totally
eliminate
the
differential,
or
does
it
just
reduce
it
a
great
deal?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
on
that
point
i
also
was
wondering
with
regard
to
justice
powell's
earlier
question,
as
i
understand
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
they
took
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
at
face
value
and
said
that
your
motion
to
dismiss
was
properly
sustained.
and
don't
we
just
really...
we
are
talking
about
a
lot
of
facts
here,
but
aren't
we
pretty
much
confined
to
what
they
say
in
their
complaint?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
does
make
this
allegation
about
not
a
minimally
adequate
education,
whatever
it
is.
and
i
think
your
argument
is
that
even
if
that
is
all
true,
there
is
still
no
federal
relief
that
they
are
entitled
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
am
just
wondering,
we
are
really
limited
to
the
complaint
itself
for
purposes
of
our
decision
as
to
whether
it
needs
further--
--to
the
well
pleaded
facts.
