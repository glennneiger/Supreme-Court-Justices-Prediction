mr.
freeland,
i
assume
as
far
as
you
are
concerned
that
we
could
take
judicial
notice
of
the
matters
in
the
public
record
such
as
the
annual
report
of
the
superintendent
of
public
education
to
the
state
legislature
from
mississippi.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
in
looking
at
that
report,
it
appears
that
there
are
other
state
funds
that
go
toward
the
pupil
costs
of
public
education
in
the
state
of
mississippi
other
than
the
16th
section
and
lieu
lands
revenue.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
appropriations
that
go
to
the
costs
of
public
school
education.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
aside
from
the
16th
section
and
the
lieu
lands
revenues.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
percentage
of
the
funds
per
pupil
would
you
say
comes
from
other
funds,
local,
state,
and
possibly
federal,
other
than
these
moneys
you
are
worried
about,
the
lieu
lands
and
16th
section?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
my
question
goes
to
what
other
revenues
go
toward
public
school
education.
those
figures,
of
course,
are
in
your
brief,
but
the
other
figures
are
not.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
state,
local,
and
federal?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
money,
state,
local,
and
federal.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
is
it
your
position
that
the
80
percent
funding
does
not
give
a
minimally
adequate
education?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
say
that
the
absence
of
the
cession
lands
revenues
makes
the
difference
between
a
minimally
adequate
education
and
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
aren't
you
really
asking
damages
for
prior
breaches
of
the
trust
obligation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
is
no
corpus
left.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
arnold--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--is
the
state
under
an
obligation
to
return
the
money
attributable
to
16th
section
lands
to
the
school
district
in
which
the
16th
section
is
located?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
they
pooled
then?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
16th
section
lands--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--income
is
pooled?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
my
question
was,
is
there
some
obligation
that
those
moneys
from
the
16th
section
go
to
the
school
district
in
which
the
section
is
located?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
a
state
law
requirement--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--or
a
federal
law
requirement.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
do
you
think
governs
the
obligation
to
return
that
money
to
the
school
district
in
which
it
is
located?
is
it
governed
by
the
schmidt
case,
where
justice
holmes
said
the
obligation
is
just
an
honorary,
not
an
enforceable
one?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
sixteenth
section
lands.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
put
it
in
a
pool
and
redistribute
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
has
the
state
made
it
a
state
law
that
it
will
not
do
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
state
constitution.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
arnold,
do
you
agree
with
the
statements
of
mr.
freeland
about
the
amount
of
money
that
goes
per
pupil
for
education
from
all
sources
other
than
these
16th
section
and
lieu
lands
moneys?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
arnold,
what...
to
the
extent
that
the
plaintiff
said
in
the
complaint
mississippi
is
depriving
the
children
of
the
plaintiff
class
of
a
minimally
adequate
education,
and
that
is
prohibited
by
the
equal
protection
clause,
now,
just
to
that
extent,
is
that
barred
in
your
view
also
by
the
eleventh
amendment,
that
kind
of
a
claim?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
assuming
that
what
the
court
said
was
that
you
will
apply
a
higher
level
of
scrutiny
if
a
child
is
denied
a
minimally
adequate
public
school
education,
and
that
is
alleged
in
the
complaint,
do
you
think
the
eleventh
amendment
absolutely
bars
that
complaint
in
federal
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
the
facts
weren't
developed,
were
they?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
reason
it
was
difficult
to
address
it,
of
course,
is
that
the
record
that
we
got
just
didn't
really
reflect
what
other
funding
the
state
gives
to
peoples.
that
is
the
handicap.
