justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you
right
now,
do
you
claim
that
it
is
contrary
to
federal
law
or
the
constitution
for
the
state
to
allow
this
school
land
money
to
be
allocated
to
the
counties
in
which
the
land
is?
do
you
think
they
must
administer
for
the
state
as
a
whole
and
distribute
it
equally?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
doesn't
answer
my
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
good.
so
you
think
they
should
take
the
total
trust
income
from
trust
lands
and
divide
it
among
the
counties
in
accordance
with
the
number
of
students
or
some
other
neutral
standard?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
i
thought
you
said
that
it
would
be
contrary
to
federal
law
to
let
the
counties
in
which
the
land
is
located
have
all
the
money
generated
for
that
land.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
there
wasn't
this
cherokee
land
involved
at
all,
and
every
county
in
the
state
had
that
section
of
land
or
whatever
it
was,
those
sections
of
land,
but
that
those
lands
in
the
different
counties
produced
different
income,
different
levels
of
income,
and
some
counties
from
the
school
land
would
be
getting
x
dollars
per
child,
and
other
counties
would
be
getting
one-tenth
that
per
child.
now,
would
that
be
permissible?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
it
be,
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
do
not
attack
allocating
the
income
to
the
counties
in
which
the
land
is
located.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
said
it
was
80
percent
in
the
south.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
would
be,
i
thought
you
said,
about
97
percent,
that
only
3
percent
of
the
money
came
from
the
lieu
lands.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
again,
how
much,
what
percentage
in
the
north
part
of
the
state
is
comparable
to
the
80
percent
in
the
south?
what
would
that
figure
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
percentage.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
an
equal
protection
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
does
do
the
leasing?
i
thought
it
was
the
county.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
it
is
only
those
school
districts
in
which
lands
are
located
that
are
going
to
get
any
of
the
money.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
and
so
there
could
be
two
adjoining
school
districts
in
that
part
of
the
state.
one
gets
some
money,
and
the
other
get
none.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
the
secretary
of
state
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
his
role?
i
thought
he
had
a
supervisory
role
with
respect
to
all
16th
section
land.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
i
understand
that.
but
what
is
the
scope
of
his
duties
with
respect
to
the
non-chickasaw
lands?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
$75
per
student,
that
is
just
the...
is
that
the
highest
that
any
school
district
gets
from
the
16th
section
lands?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
an
average.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
aren't
there
some
school
districts
in
the
chocktaw
area
that
don't
get
any?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
which
is
less
than
the
chickasaw
school
districts
get.
justice
byron
r.
white
from
the
16th
section
lands?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
be
the...
is
that
$75
per
student,
is
that
the
average
per
student
in
the
school
districts
that
get
something,
or
does
that
average
out
through
all
of
the
school
districts?
justice
byron
r.
white
including
the
ones
who
don't
get
anything?
justice
byron
r.
white
counties
or
school
districts?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
the
leases
made
by
the
counties?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
the
counties
don't
make...
the
lease
rental
is
not
paid
to
the
county,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
paid
to
school
districts,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
we
disagree
with
you
that
there
is
any
trust
at
all?
then
do
you
still
claim
that
there
is
an
equal
protection
violation?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
there
is
no
trust.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
even
if
the
chickasaw
counties
or
school
districts
have
no
claim
whatsoever
to
any
moneys
from
16th
section
lands
or
from
lieu
lands.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
think
you
would
rather
have
us
find
there
was
no
trust.
justice
byron
r.
white
aren't
you
arguing
against
yourself
really?
