justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
freeland,
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
the
facts.
my
understanding
was
that
the
counties
you
represent
were
owned
by
an
indian
tribe,
and
when
the
united
states
government
took
that
land
over
and
sold
it,
they
gave
the
proceeds
to
the
state
of
mississippi.
the
state
then
invested
the
proceeds
in
bonds
of
a
railroad
that
went
broken
during
the
war
between
the
states.
is
that
correct?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
is
incorrect?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
all
right.
tell
me
what
the
facts
are.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
united
states
government
did
that,
didn't
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
did
they
put
all
of
that
money
in
the
railroads?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
no
suit
has
been
brought
against
the
state
in
all
the
years
that
have
passed
since
then?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
freeland,
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
the
fundamentals.
do
the
localities
have
the
primary
responsibility
for
financing
public
education
in
mississippi?
the
localities?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
state
has.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
the
funding
of
public
education
the
largest
single
item
in
the
state
budget?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
think
that
is
true
in
most
states.
now,
i
get
back
to
the
question
you
have
been
asked
several
times.
is
that
allocated
on
a
per
pupil
basis?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
average
daily
attendance.
is
that
fairly
done
across
the
state,
including
the
counties
you
represent?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
none
whatever.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
percentage,
again
i
ask
you,
of
the
funds
in
these
counties
comes
from
that
state
appropriation?
did
you
say
80
percent?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
freeman,
i
am
sure
mississippi,
like
other
states
in
the
public
school
system
tests
the
progress
of
pupils
periodically
in
different
grades.
does
the
record
in
this
case
show
the
achievement
test
scores
of
the
counties
in
northern
virginia
as
compared
with
other
rural
counties
in
the
state?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
without
such
a
showing,
how
can
you
persuade
as
that
people
in
your
county,
children
in
your
county
are
not
receiving
a
minimally
adequate
education?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
you
have
to
allege
facts
to
support
it.
that
is
a
conclusion,
isn't
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
how
do
you
define
minimum
adequate
education?
