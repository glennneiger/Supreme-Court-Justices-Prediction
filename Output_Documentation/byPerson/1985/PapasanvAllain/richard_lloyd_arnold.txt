mr.
richard
lloyd
arnold
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
initially
i
would
like
to
correct
some
misstatements
by
counsel
as
to
the
chocktaw
cession
counties,
and
that
is
the
way
it
is
referred
to.
there
was
the
chocktaw
indian
tribe
in
basically
the
southern
two-thirds
of
the
state,
the
chickasaw
indian
tribe
in
the
northern
one-third,
relatively
speaking.
every
school
district,
and
let's
talk
school
districts
and
not
counties,
because
school
districts
are
the
geographical
areas,
every
school
district
in
the
southern
part
of
mississippi
in
the
chocktaw
cession
does
not
receive
income
from
16th
section
lands.
it
is
just
simply
not
the
case.
for
instance,
the
meridian
public
school
system
receives
from
16th
section
lands
zero.
it
has
no
16th
section
lands.
the
greenwood
municipal
separate
school
district,
located
in
the
mississippi
delta,
which
has
been
referred
to
earlier,
receives
some
16th
section
land
zero.
it
has
no
16th
section
lands
there.
there
are
at
least
20
school
districts
in
the
southern
half
of
the
state
of
mississippi
which
receive
less
than
the
chocktaw...
the
chickasaw
cession
districts,
the
lowest
chickasaw
district
receives
from
the
state
of
mississippi.
mr.
richard
lloyd
arnold
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
richard
lloyd
arnold
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
so.
we
don't
believe
that
the
petitioners
here
have
ever
asked
that,
that
the
funds
be
returned
to
them
in
any
way,
and
i
don't
believe
the
state
would
be
in
an
obligation
to
make
that
return
to
them.
the
state
had
the--
mr.
richard
lloyd
arnold
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
lloyd
arnold
no.
mr.
richard
lloyd
arnold
no.
pardon
me,
your
honor.
i
misunderstood
your
question.
the
16th
section
money
from
the
leases
does
not
come
to
the
state.
i
misspoke
myself.
i
thought
you
were
referring
to
the
chickasaw
cession
funds
being
returned
to
the
chickasaw
counties.
no,
your
honor.
the
state
does
not
receive
those
funds.
those
funds
are
dependent
upon
the
lease
by
the
local
school
district.
mr.
richard
lloyd
arnold
yes,
i
believe
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
lloyd
arnold
no,
ma'am.
mr.
richard
lloyd
arnold
that
is
a
federal
law
requirement.
i
believe
that
is
found
in
the
enabling
act,
land
sales
act,
found
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
56...
55,
pardon
me,
section
12,
where
the
16th
section
lands
reserved
in
each
township
for
the
schools
therein
and
also
it
is
found
in
the
1917
land
sales
act
where
mississippi
became
a
state,
joint
appendix
60,
reserves
for
the
schools
therein.
mr.
richard
lloyd
arnold
no,
sir,
it
is...
the
individual
board
of
education
in
that
school
district
leases
the
lands
and
the
minerals
thereunder,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
lloyd
arnold
yes,
sir,
and
the
amount
they
get
depends
upon
the
geographical
location
of
the
school
district.
mr.
richard
lloyd
arnold
yes,
sir,
that
is
a
fact.
for
instance,
the
meridian
school
district
is
located
in
lauderdale
county,
mississippi.
i
believe
lauderdale
county
schools
do
get
some
income
from
16th
section
lands
whereas
the
municipal
separate
school
district,
due
to
its
geographical
location
and
configuration,
receives
none,
and
also
the
fact,
i
believe
the
lands
in
meridian,
there
may
have
been
some
lands
located
there
at
one
time,
but
they
were
also
sold,
the
16th
section
lands
were
sold.
mr.
richard
lloyd
arnold
yes,
sir,
it
would
if
it
had
the
16th
section
lands
in
it.
yes,
sir.
they
had
not
been
previously
disposed
of
in
some
way,
and
we
do
have
that
in
some
areas
of
the
state
where
there
was
no
prohibition
on
the
alienation
of
these
lands
under
the
state
constitution,
and
the
lands
were
sold
some
years
ago.
other
lands
had
been
previously
settled
prior
to
the
extinguishment
of
the
indian
claims
under
the
spanish
dominion
or
the
french
dominion.
mr.
richard
lloyd
arnold
to
return
the
money
in
the
chocktaw,
where
they
actually
have
the
land,
your
honor?
mr.
richard
lloyd
arnold
well,
i
think
it
could
have
been
done
another
way.
i
think
the
state
had
the
option,
perhaps,
to
have
leased
all
the
lands
that
it
so
desired,
brought
the
money
in,
and
redistributed
based
upon
some
form--
mr.
richard
lloyd
arnold
--yes,
i
think
it
could
have
done
that,
but
it
also
had
the
option
to
allow--
mr.
richard
lloyd
arnold
--yes,
ma'am,
it
is
in
the
constitution,
section
211.
mr.
richard
lloyd
arnold
yes,
ma'am,
provides
for
how
it
is
done.
as
we
correct
a
few
other
items
here,
with
reference
to
the
fact
that
the
delta
lands
were
so
valuable,
they
weren't
then.
it
was
swamp,
overflow
lands,
very
few
roads,
and
$6
an
acre
for
the
sale
of
the
land
was
probably
pretty
good
money
back
then.
the
delta
wasn't
really
settled
and
drained
and
roads
built
and
railroads
built
in
there
until
some
time
after
the
1870's.
mr.
richard
lloyd
arnold
they
seem
to
think,
your
honor...
we
think
the
issues
come
down
very
simply
in
this
case.
they
are
saying
either
raise
the
amount
that
is
in
the
corpus,
the
principal
amount,
or
raise
the
interest
that
is
paid.
that
appears
to
us
to
be
the
issue
here
in
this
case.
that
is
the
reason
for
the
eleventh
amendment
jurisdictional
bar
we
have
made
in
the
district
court,
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
before
this
court,
but
be
that
as
it
may,
i
don't...
they
seem
to
think
that
the
principal
should
be
raised
or
the
interest
should
be
raised.
and
we
think
the
eleventh
amendment
jurisdictional
ball
would
prohibit
that.
if
we
look
at
who...
and
it
has
been
referred
to,
the
trustees,
the
trustees,
the
trustees.
not
one
single
named
state
official
in
our
office
is
a
trustee
of
the
chickasaw
fund.
not
one.
not
in
the
constitution.
not
in
the
state
law.
or
they
have
made
a
trustee
of
that
fund.
the
legislature
of
the
state,
the
state
itself
has
helped
itself
to
be
a
trustee
of
the
chickasaw
fund.
it
cannot
be
funded
except
by
the
legislature.
the
legislature
is
the
only...
the
state
is
the
trustee
of
the
fund,
not
the
governor
of
the
state
of
mississippi,
not
the
secretary
of
state.
mr.
richard
lloyd
arnold
well,
he
had
a
lot
to
say,
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
we
somewhat
oppose,
but
i
don't
believe
the
secretary
of
state
spoke
to
the
issues
in
the
case
here.
he
spoke
to
maybe
the
emotional
issues
of
school
children,
and--
mr.
richard
lloyd
arnold
--he
has
a
supervisory
role
as
to
the
16th
section
lands
in
the
chocktaw
cession.
that
is
correct.
but
he
his
no
supervisory
role
as
to
the
trust,
the
monetary
trust
on
the
chickasaw
lands,
none
whatsoever.
mr.
richard
lloyd
arnold
the
chocktaw?
his
duty
is
to
check
and
see
two
primary
things,
that
the
land
is
not
disposed
of
because
our
constitution
now
which
was
adopted
in
1890
prohibits
the
sale
of
16th
section
lands.
they
cannot
be
sold.
before
that
time
there
was
no
prohibition
as
to
the
sale
of
these
lands.
one,
he
sees
that.
two,
he
sees
that
the
lands
are
administered
in
such
a
way
that
a
reasonable
income
is
derived
therefrom,
and
that
they
are
not
donated.
the
law
in
mississippi
on
16th
section
lands
underwent
a
dramatic
change
in
1978.
up
until
that
time
they
had
been
very
loosely
administered
in
that
regard.
the
legislature
proposed
a
constitutional
amendment,
changed
it
around,
gave
the
secretary
of
state
much
more
power.
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
affirmed
this
power
to
go
out
and
check
on
these
counties
and
see
if
they
were
in
fact
getting
the
highest
amount
they
could
from
the
lands
there.
so
he
has
that
duty.
mr.
richard
lloyd
arnold
your
honor,
i
do
not
agree
with
some
of
his
statements
there.
i
do
not
have
an
exact
figure
or
percentage
as
to
the
amount.
however,
much
like
texas
had
done
in
the
san
antonio
versus
rodriguez
case,
the
state
of
mississippi,
every
child,
every
school
district
in
the
state
as
far
as
an
appropriation
is
concerned
from
the
state
of
mississippi,
gets
the
exact
same
amount
of
money
per
teacher
unit.
there
is
no
distinction,
whether
it
runs
from
tunica
county
all
the
way
to
jackson
county
on
the
opposite
end
of
the
state.
this
money
also
goes...
mr.
freeman
says
it
does
not
go
for
teachers'
salaries.
on
the
contrary,
it
does.
the
money
can
be
used
for
teachers'
salaries,
and
this
is
separated,
divided
up
when
it
goes
to
the
schools
there,
teachers'
salaries,
superintendent
and
principals'
salaries,
separate
services
such
as
salaries
for
art
and
music
teachers,
librarians,
guidance
counselors,
as
well
as
providing
for
nurses
and
lunchroom
personnel
together
with
the
funds
for
textbooks,
audiovisual
equipment,
building
improvements,
and
cost
of
transportation.
mr.
richard
lloyd
arnold
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
lloyd
arnold
yes.
mr.
richard
lloyd
arnold
based
on
the
figures
that
are
there,
your
honor,
those
figures--
mr.
richard
lloyd
arnold
--they
have
changed
substantially
since
1985.
the
state
is
now
appropriating...
well,
july
1st
of
this
year
it
will
be
$2
million,
which
will
go
to
the
chickasaw
cession
school
districts
there.
mr.
richard
lloyd
arnold
no,
sir.
i
think
it
reduces
it
a
great
deal,
but
even
as
this
money
goes,
i
think
we
really
have
a
de
minimis
effect
here
as
far
as
the
question
of
a
minimally
adequate
education.
i
am
not
sure
that
i
understand
what
it
is,
your
honor,
based
upon
the--
mr.
richard
lloyd
arnold
--yes.
mr.
richard
lloyd
arnold
that
is
the
position
of
the
state,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
lloyd
arnold
well
pled
facts,
i
believe.
thank
you,
your
honor.
not
just--
mr.
richard
lloyd
arnold
--no,
sir,
i
believe
that
is
an
average.
mr.
richard
lloyd
arnold
average.
mr.
richard
lloyd
arnold
yes,
sir,
there
are
some
that
get
absolute
zero,
as
i
pointed
out.
mr.
richard
lloyd
arnold
yes,
sir,
that's
correct.
there
are
at
least
two
that
get
zero,
and
as
i
recall,
i
believe
the
biloxi
municipal
separate
school
district
gets
substantially
under
$100
a
year
total.
i
mean,
total
amount,
not--
mr.
richard
lloyd
arnold
--yes,
sir.
i
mean,
we
are
speaking
not
per
student
or
anything.
we
are
speaking
total
amount
of
money
that
they
get
at
all
there.
mr.
richard
lloyd
arnold
and
a
distinction
that
should
be
made,
i
believe--
mr.
richard
lloyd
arnold
--i
think
that
is
the
average
for
all
school
districts.
that
is
taking,
as
i
understand
it--
mr.
richard
lloyd
arnold
--yes,
your
honor,
and
of
course
that
is
inflated.
some
school
districts
have
vast
mineral
wealth
under
them,
under
their
16th
section
lands,
and
they
have
leased
that.
of
course,
prices
have
been
falling
lately.
i
think
these
figures
may
change
around
based
on
some
changes
in
the
economic
pattern
here
in
the
last
few
months
or
years
for
that
matter.
another
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
the
chickasaw
cession
counties
are
getting
an
appropriation
from
the
state,
albeit
it
only
$66,000,
66
percent
of
the
corpus
on
the
trust.
they
are
getting
something
that
not
another
county
or
school
district
in
the
state
gets.
they
are
getting,
as
we
say,
a
land...
something
they
are
getting
that
no
one
else
is
getting
there
from
the
state--
so
i
think
that
when
we
look
at
it
from
the
standpoint
that
the
state
allows
the
local
school
districts
to
manage
their
own
16th
section
lands
subject
to
state
oversight
to
make
sure
there
is
no
donation
of
the
land
or
disposition
of
the
land
that
is
not
permitted
under
state
law
under
the
constitution,
that
there
is
no
unequal
treatment
here.
this
court
has
also
said
that
the
equal
protection
clause
is
not
applicable,
i
believe,
and
geographical
differentials
there.
it
is
between
persons,
and
this
is
a
geographical
differential
simply
because
the
initial
action
of
not
reserving
the
16th
section
lands
precipitated
this
whole
lawsuit.
that
is
what
started
it.
the
16th
section
lands
were
not
reserved--
finally,
some
five
or
six
years,
seven
years
later,
the
state
was
allowed
to
select
some
lands,
the
governor
of
the
state,
and
that
is
the
only
thing
that
any
named
official
in
this
complaint
has
ever
done
in
regard
to
the
chickasaw
cession
lands.
the
federal
government
allowed
the
governor
to
go
out
and
select
these
lands
in
the
mississippi
delta
which
were
virtually
unsettled
at
the
time,
as
i
said,
swamp
and
overflow
land.
the
attorney
general
has
never
done
anything
in
regard
to
these
lands,
nor
has
he
been
authorized
to.
there
has
been
no
duties
imposed
upon
the
attorney
general
of
the
state.
the
mere
fact
that
he
may
be
a
member
of
the
board
of
education,
or
was
at
one
time
until
the
law
was
changed,
just
simply
does
not
subject
him
to
being
enjoined
in
this
thing.
there
is
nothing
he
can
do.
he
does
not
administer
the
trust.
he
can't
change
it
around.
he
can't
invest
it
in
some
other
type
of
investment.
he
can't
change
it
around
or
change
the
interest
paid.
the
same
is
true
of
the
secretary
of
state.
he
no
longer
sits
on
the
board
of
education.
he
is
a
member
of
the
state
lieu
land
commission,
and
under
our
law,
which
is
still
in
effect,
and
under
the
constitution
lieu
lands
can
be
disposed
of
to
this
day,
right
now.
i
believe
there
are
something
like
37
acres
left
that
nobody
really
wants,
but
you
can
dispose
of
lieu
lands
under
state
law
at
this
time.
so,
it
is
our
contention...
and
also
the
superintendent
of
education
at
one
time
was
a
member
of
the
board
of
education.
he
is
not
any
more.
ha
was
appointed
by
the
board
of
education.
the
assistant
secretary
of
state,
that
person
is
basically
someone
there
who
keeps
up
with
the
state
lands,
where
is
the
state
land,
has
it
been
leased,
is
it
coming
up
for
renewal,
and
this
sort
of
thing.
these
offices,
and
that
is
what
is
sued
here,
they
are
only
sued
in
their
official
capacity,
have
never
acquired
or
disposed
of
the
chickasaw
lieu
lands
or
handled
any
funds
from
there.
in
order
to
accomplish
what
the
petitioners
seek
here,
the
state
of
mississippi,
the
state
of
mississippi
would
have
to
grant
the
relief.
if
there
is
an
injunction
issued
in
this
case,
as
petitioners
seek,
it
would
have
to
be
out
of
the
corpus
of
the
state
of
mississippi
to
pay
this
money
in
the
future.
that
is
where
it
would
come
from,
and
we
submit
that
this
would
be
proscribed
by
the
eleventh
amendment
on
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
start
back
with
hans
v.
louisiana
and
come
forward
all
the
way
through
green
versus
mansour,
i
believe,
decided
this
term
by
the
court.
one
other
matter
we
would
point
out
to
the
court
at
this
time
is
that
the...
if
the
court
were
to
make
the
order
that
petitioners
seek,
we
believe
it
would
literally
open
the
proverbial
pandora's
box.
every
school
district
in
the
southern
district
of
the
state
of
mississippi
would
then
sue
the
state,
saying,
well,
another
school
district
has
got
more
money
or
more
land
or
receives
more
income
from
there
because
of
geographical
variances
than
we
do,
so
we
will
sue,
and
we
will
get
our
money
back,
or
get
some
more
money
back,
although
we
have
sold
our
lands
some
years
ago.
mr.
richard
lloyd
arnold
your
honor,
i
believe
it
would
be.
as
i
read
filer
v.
doe
and
san
antonio
there,
what
this
court
has
said
in
the
past
is
that
it
is
the
absolute
deprivation
of
an
education
that
is
barred
by
the--
mr.
richard
lloyd
arnold
--if
the
state
is
the
real
true
party
in
interest,
your
honor,
to
require
the
state
to
expend
funds,
perhaps
it
would.
i
think
it
would
depend
on
the
facts
as
they
have
evolved
by
the
court,
but
in
the
facts
that
we
have
alleged
here--
mr.
richard
lloyd
arnold
--right,
but
as
the
facts
are
alleged
here,
i
believe
the
eleventh
amendment
would
proscribe
that,
would
be
a
jurisdictional
bar
as
far
as
the
state
of
mississippi,
and
it
is
the
real
party
in
interest
in
this
case,
we
submit.
the
other
defendants
are
nominal
defendants
only
for
the
purpose
of
attempting
to
evade
the
eleventh
amendment
jurisdictional
bar
which
would
apply
to
the
state.
so,
i
think
it
would
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
lloyd
arnold
i
am
not
sure,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
if
they
raised
that
or
not
in
the
san
antonio
case.
i
don't
recall
it
in
seeing
if
they
raised
the
eleventh
amendment
as
a
jurisdictional
bar
in
that
case
there.
but
be
that
as
it
may,
assuming
arguendo
that
the
eleventh
amendment
is
not
a
jurisdictional
bar
in
this
case,
there
just
simply
has
not
been
a
cause
of
action
stated
that
can
survive
a
motion
to
dismiss
under
12(b)(6).
a
boilerplate
allegation,
just
boilerplate,
deprived
of
a
minimally
adequate
education,
it
is
just
not
there.
that
is
just
not
something
i
think
this
court
or
any
federal
court
could
address.
the
court
would
be
continually
looking
over
this.
mr.
richard
lloyd
arnold
perhaps
in
the
record
not,
your
honor,
but
in
our
brief,
i
believe,
on
page
6
we
referred
to
the
minimum
program
for
education
that
the
state
of
mississippi
provides
and
what
those
funds
go
to,
and
how
it
goes
to
each
school
district
based
upon
the
teacher
units.
perhaps
i
did
not
make
this
clear
as
i
should
have
to
the
court.
but
other
than
that,
that
fund
going
to
these
school
districts
throughout
the
state,
the
only
other
appropriation
specifically
out
of
the
state
treasury
to
education
is
the
money
to
the
chickasaw
cession.
in
that
regard,
i
believe
the
figures
will
show,
the
most
recent
figures
show
in
the
state
of
mississippi
approximately
62
or
63
percent,
in
that
range,
of
the
total
state
budget
is
directed
to
educational
matters
throughout
the
state
and
the
public
education
in
the
state.
i
think
this
year
it
probably
increased.
there
have
been
some
increases
as
far
as
the
amount
the
state
would
pay
in
teachers'
salaries.
but
we
would
submit
to
the
court
that
the
state
of
mississippi
is
the
real
true
party
in
interest
in
this
case.
they
are
seeking
what
they
call
an
injunction,
but
it
would
require
the
state
to
expend
its
funds
out
of
the
state
treasury.
we
also
submit
that
there
is
no
equal
protection
claim
based
upon
the
allegations
made
in
the
complaint
here,
because
to
the
contrary
of
not
receiving
everything
that
the
state
appropriates
to
every
school
district,
the
districts
in
the
northern
section
of
the
state
receive
more
as
far
as
appropriation
from
the
state
of
mississippi
itself
there.
and
the
fact
that
one
school
district
may
be
able
to
raise
more
money
because
the
land
is
valuable
or
it
has
minerals
under
it
is
not
an
equal
protection
question
that
should
be
addressed
by
this
court
or
any
other
lower
federal
court.
thank
you.
