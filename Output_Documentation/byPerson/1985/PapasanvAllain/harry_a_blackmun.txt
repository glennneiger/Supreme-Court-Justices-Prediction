blackmun
i
share
justice
o'connor's
concern.
don't
you
end
up
in
a
situation
where
the
children
in
the
chickasaw
cession
lands
get
about
the
same
overall
as
those
in
the
southern
part
of
the
state?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
get
the
other
impression
from
looking
at
the
facts
here,
but
go
ahead
and
explain.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
know,
you
say
that,
but
we
are
asking,
overall,
with
all
other
funds
available,
what
is
the
answer?
