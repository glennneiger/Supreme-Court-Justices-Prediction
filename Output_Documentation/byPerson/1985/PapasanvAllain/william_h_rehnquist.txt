justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
order
of
magnitude
are
we
talking
about?
is
it
a
correct
interpretation
of
your
answers
to
justice
blackmun
that
about
80
percent
of
the
public
funds
from
everywhere
in
mississippi
for
schools
come
from
sources
other
than
these
lieu
lands?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
how
much
comes
in...
much
more
than
80
percent,
perhaps
approaching
100
percent?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
counsel,
what
we
are
interested
in
is,
what
is
the
disparity,
when
you
add
all
the
figures
together
of
all
sources
for
public
education?
what
is
the
disparity
between
the
southern
part
of
the
state
and
what
you
refer
to
as
the
chickasaw
cession?
is
it
roughly
100
percent
to
80
percent?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
insofar
as
you
claim
a
violation
of
the
trust,
that
really
occurred
over
100
years
ago,
didn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that
is,
you
know,
that
is
the
way
everybody
tries
to
get
around
the
statute
of
limitations,
is
to
say,
well,
this
didn't
just
happen
in
1868.
it
is
a
continuing
offense,
but
a
lot
of
courts
reject
that
as
kind
of
phoney.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
trustee
doesn't
admit
of
any
greater
duty,
obviously,
than
to
pay
the
income
from
the
substitute
funds.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
legislature
simply
appropriates
what
would
have...
a
hypothetical
income
on
that
fund?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
only
reason
that
the
northern
counties
are
treated
any
differently
than
the
southern
was
the
bad
investment
during
the
civil
war...
pardon
me,
the
war
between
the
states,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
both
those
cases
came
up
through
the
state
court
system,
didn't
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
alamo
came
up
through
the
federal
courts?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
of
course,
the
eleventh
amendment
is
no
bar
to
a
suit
by
the
united
states
against
the
states.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
a
school
district
that
occupied
two
or
three
townships,
i
suppose
it
would
have
two
or
three
sources
of
this
kind
of
income.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you
are
right,
why
wouldn't
the
san
antonio
case
have
gone
off
on
the
eleventh
amendment
grounds
rather
than
the
substantive
equal
protection
decision?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
school
districts
are
not
necessarily
coterminus
with
counties,
are
they?
i
mean,
may
there
not
be
more
than
one
school
district
in
a
county?
