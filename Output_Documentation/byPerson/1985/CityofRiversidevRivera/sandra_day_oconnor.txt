justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
suppose
some
injunctive
relief
were
granted
or
some
declaratory
relief
as
well
as
damages,
how
would
you
then
suggest
the
court
approach
the
fee
problem?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
it
is
arguable
that
even
though
this
is
private
litigation
that
the
precedential
value
it
sets
may
have
value
above
and
beyond
the
individual
plaintiffs?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
there
is
an
argument
that
these
findings
and
allowances
were
clearly
erroneous
in
view
of
the
fact
that
so
many
of
the
defendants
were
found
not
responsible
in
the
last
analysis
and
that
a
good
amount
of
the
work
went
to
pursuit
of
their
liability?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
then
i
think
also
the
fact
that
the
total
amount
of
recovery
was
so
much
less
than
that
sought.
don't
those
things
go
to
reasonableness
and
can't
you
make
a
valid
argument
that
the
court
below
was
clearly
erroneous?
