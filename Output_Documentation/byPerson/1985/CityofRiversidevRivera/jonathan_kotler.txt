mr.
jonathan
kotler
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
raises
an
issue
involving
the
interpretation
of
the
language
chosen
by
congress
when
it
enacted
section
1988
of
title
42
which
provides
that
a
trial
court
may
award
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee
to
a
prevailing
party
in
certain
civil
rights
actions.
specifically,
this
case
raises
the
question
of
whether
an
award
of
attorney's
fees
seven
times
the
amount
received
by
the
plaintiffs
in
a
private
action
resulting
only
in
monetary
relief
can
possibly
be
deemed
reasonable
under
section
1988.
more
broadly,
this
case
also
raises
the
question
of
whether
section
1988
mandates
some
relationship
between
the
results
obtained
by
a
prevailing
party
in
a
civil
rights
action
and
the
fees
which
a
trial
judge
may
award
thereafter.
as
such,
it
caused
them
to
question
the
efficacy
of
the
continued
use
of
the
lodestar
approach
to
fee
calculations
in
cases
which
are
essentially
private
court
actions.
it
is
the
position
of
the
petitioners
that
the
lodestar
approach
in
a
case
such
as
this,
rather
than
producing
a
fee
which
is
presumptively
reasonable,
can
often,
as
here,
produce
a
fee
which
is
unreasonable
on
its
face.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
that
took
in
the
number
of
hours
that
doubled,
the
multiplier
of
two,
yes.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
yes.
all
their
hours
at
a
rate
of
$125
an
hour.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
our
last
offer
of
settlement
was
$25,000.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
yes,
your
honor.
there
has
been
a
great
amount
in
the
record
disputing
that
back
and
forth.
the
last
offer
that
was
made
in
front
of
a
trial
judge
was
$10,000.
the
last
offer
that
was
made
to
one
of
the
co-counsel
was
$25,000.
it
is
likewise
petitioners'
belief
that
a
fee
calculated
on
the
same
basis
as
fees
for
similar
litigation
in
a
given
community
not
only
provides
a
more
accurate
reflection
of
the
true
value
of
legal
services
rendered
in
a
private
1983
case,
but,
moreover,
would
produce
a
fee
more
consistent
with
the
goals
of
congress
when
congress
enacted
1988,
which
is,
of
course,
a
fee
that
is
reasonable.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
i
think
there
are.
i
think
if
the
benefit
that
is
yielded
as
a
result
of
an
action
benefits
more
than
the
individual
plaintiffs
results
in
policy
changes,
results
in--
mr.
jonathan
kotler
--i
would
characterize
that
as
a
private
1988
case.
factually,
this
case
began
following
an
altercation
between
the
respondents
and
various
members
of
the
riverside
city
police
of
riverside,
california,
in
august
of
1975.
thereafter,
the
respondents
filed
an
action
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
central
district
of
california
against
32
defendants,
including
the
city
of
riverside
and
its
chief
of
police.
their
action
included
civil
rights
claims
as
well
as
a
mixed
bag
of
pendent
state
claims,
including
claims
for
assault
and
battery,
claims
for
property
damage,
infliction
of
emotional
distress,
malicious
prosecution,
defamation,
false
arrest
and
false
imprisonment,
and
simple
negligence.
in
addition
to
seeking
money
damages,
the
respondents
herein
sought
wide-ranging
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief
as
well.
ultimately
the
matter
was
tried
to
a
jury
in
1980
and
when
all
was
said
and
done
respondents
recovered
jury
awards
against
only
six
of
the
32
defendants
against
whom
they
had
litigated.
no
police
officer
above
the
rank
of
lieutenant
was
found
to
have
any
liability
to
any
of
the
respondents
and
26
of
the
defendant
officers,
including
17
who
had
been
previously
dismissed
by
the
first
trial
judge
assigned
to
hear
this
case
on
summary
judgment,
26
of
the
defendant
officers
were
found
to
have
no
liability
to
any
of
the
respondents
on
any
theory
whatsoever.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
that
is
correct,
justice
blackmun.
initially
there
was
but--
mr.
jonathan
kotler
--i
would
have
taken
discovery
as
the
attorneys
for
the
other
side
did,
and
once
i
found
out
who
was
involved,
i
would
have
dismissed
those
that
were
not
involved.
however,
once
this
was
found
out,
the
other
side
not
only
refused
to
dismiss,
but--
mr.
jonathan
kotler
--the
offer
that
we
made
was
within
$8,000
of
the
eventual
jury
verdict,
so
i
don't
think
it
was
that
far
off,
but
i
don't
think
i
would
have
continued
to
have
litigated
against
people
that
i
knew
two
years
before
the
trial,
and
that
is
when
it
was,
two
years
before
the
trial,
had
no
liability
or
not
culpability
whatsoever.
of
all
the
claims
asserted
by
the
respondents,
they
recovered
only
on
their
section
1983
claim
and
their
pendent
state
claims
for
false
arrest,
false
imprisonment
and
negligence.
of
all
the
types
of
relief
which
respondents
sought...
they
only
recovered
money
damages
and
this
in
the
sum
of
$33,350.
no
injunctive
or
declaratory
relief
issued
as
a
result
of
their
action,
and
more
importantly,
the
city
of
riverside
was
not
compelled
to
and
did
not
change
any
of
its
policies
or
practices
as
a
result
of
this
lawsuit.
in
sum,
the
results
achieved
by
this
litigation
was
far
less
than
the
revenue
sought.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
to
my
knowledge,
they
are,
your
honor,
and
the
one
lieutenant
who
was
found
to
have
culpability
is
now
the
chief
of
police.
and,
yet,
the
district
court,
following
these
verdicts,
awarded
to
respondents'
attorneys
fees
under
section
1988
for
every
minute
of
every
hour
they
claimed
to
have
spent
litigating
this
action
against
every
defendant
sued
on
every
claim,
on
every
issue,
and
every
avenue
of
relief
pursued.
they
were
fully
recompensed
for
the
time
they
spent
pursing
the
26
defendants
who
were
found
to
have
no
liability,
any
of
them.
they
were
fully
recompensed
for
time
spent
pursuing
claims
and
avenues
of
relief
on
which
they
achieved
no
success
whatsoever.
in
sum,
while
the
jury
awarded
to
the
respondents
the
amount
of
$33,350,
the
trial
judge
awarded
to
their
attorneys
an
amount
seven
times
that
sum,
approximating
a
quarter
of
a
million
dollars.
petitioners
paid
the
jury
award,
but
appealed
the
trial
judge's
award
of
attorneys'
fees
to
the
ninth
circuit
which
thereafter
affirmed
the
trial
court.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
that
they
would
be
entitled
to
a
contingency
or
fee
based
on
the
prevailing
market
rates
for
similar
litigation,
yes,
i
would.
i
think
you
have
a
situation
here--
mr.
jonathan
kotler
--i
think
it
would
be
just
as
outrageous
if
it
was
five
times
or
four
times
or
three
times
if
that
is
what
your
honor
means.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
if
the
result
in
this
case
would
wind
up
being
contingency
fee
approximating
the
same
amount
here...
that
would
have
to
be,
i
guess,
in
about
$600,000
or
$700,000
in
judgments.
they
would
be
entitled
to
one-third
of
whatever
the
contingency
was
because
the
value
of
this
case
would
have
been
$600,000
or
$700,000
as
judged
by
the
trier
of
fact,
the
jury,
but
the
jury
didn't
judge
itself.
so,
yes.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
in
attorneys'
fees.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
i
am
sorry,
your
honor,
i
don't
seem
to
understand
your
question.
that
would
have
been--
mr.
jonathan
kotler
--no,
the
court
didn't
cut
them
in
half,
the
court
just
refused
to
award
a
multiplier.
the
court
gave
them--
mr.
jonathan
kotler
--the
court
gave
them
everything
they
asked
for,
every
hour
they
asked
for,
based
on
$125
an
hour.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
multiplier
of
two,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
that
is
correct.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
that
is
correct.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
no.
what
i
am
saying
is
we
have
a
situation
now...
we
use
the
lodestar
approach
to
fee
calculation.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
basically
that
is
where
the
court
begins.
after
the
lodestar
is
calculated,
the
court
may
then
either
raise
or
lower
the
fee
award
consistent
with
the
dictates
of
hensley
and
blum
and
other
cases.
what
i
am
arguing
for,
instead
of
starting
with
the
lodestar
in
private
tort
action...
and
i
would
characterize
this
a
private
tort
action...
we
ought
to
start
with
the
similar
market-based
fee
and
then
raise
or
lower
from
that.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
no,
justice
stevens,
i
would
not.
what
i
would
ask
is
that
evidence
be
put
on
as
to
what
the
fee
arrangements
were
in
california,
or
los
angeles
more
narrowly,
for
similar
tort
actions.
what
kind
of
arrangements
were
common
in
that
locality.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
would
be
less
than
the
recovery,
but
assuming
an
award
of
a
million
dollars--
mr.
jonathan
kotler
--if
your
question
is
would
it
always
be
less
than
the
total
recovery
in
a
case,
a
private
case
winding
up
in
money
damages
only,
the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
no,
because
i
think
it
is
clear
under
the
carey
case
and
under
hensley
and
under
blum
the
court,
trial
court
still
retains
a
certain
amount
of
discretion
to--
mr.
jonathan
kotler
--i
think
the
trial
court
had
discretion,
but
i
think
the
discretion
must
be
exercised
consistent
with
the
factors
and
guidelines
that
this
court
said
had
to
be
used
in
the
hensley
case.
all
i
am
arguing
for
is
that
as
a
starting
point
we
start
at
a
different
place
than
we
are
now.
we
don't
use
the
lodestar
as
a
starting
point
in
private
action
tort
suits.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
okay.
i
didn't
mean
to
imply
that
the
contingency
basis,
just
like
the
lodestar
basis,
is
absolute.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
that
brings
me
to
my
second
point.
my
second
point
is
that
you
still
have
to
look
at
the
results
obtained
by
the
litigation
and
if
you
look
at
the
results
obtained,
it
wouldn't
be
possible
to
raise
this
case
from
$11,000,
which
is
a
one-third
contingency,
to
a
quarter
of
a
million.
i
am
arguing
for
both
things.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
well,
fortunately,
under
my
theory,
you
would
start
with
thirty-three
cents
and
then
you
could
raise
it.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
no,
not
at
all,
not
at
all.
if
the
value
of
the
case...
if
the
thing
the
case
resulted
in
achieves
some
societal
benefit,
obviously
it
could
be
raised.
but,
congress,
when
it
passed
1988,
i
don't
think
was
looking
to
provide
access
for
the
marginal
or
less
than
good
case.
it
was
providing
access
for
meritorious
cases.
and,
a
case
that
has
no
value
might
not
be
a
meritorious
case.
we
have
triers
of
fact
who
give
value
to
these
cases
and
they
are
the
jurors
and
in
this
case
the
jurors
said
the
value
of
this
case
was
$33,000.
in
other
cases,
the
value
might
be
less,
but
certainly
the
trial
judge
would
retain
some
discretion
to
raise
a
fee
if
the
value
of
the
case
in
the
trial
judge's
mind
was
in
excess
of
that
set
by
the
jury.
briefly,
on
the
facts,
a
petition
for
certiorari
was
filed
in
this
case
initially
and
was
granted
by
this
court
which
vacated
the
first
award
of
attorneys'
fees
herein
and
remanded
the
matter
back
to
the
district
court
to
be
considered
in
light
of
this
court's
then
recent
decision
of
hensley
versus
eckerhart.
thereafter,
at
spreading
of
the
mandate
from
the
ninth
circuit,
the
trial
judge
announced
that
it
was
going
to
reinstate
its
previous
award
to
the
penny
and
subsequently
did
exactly
that.
petitioners
again
appealed
and
once
again
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
the
trial
court
and
then
this
court
granted
cert
last
october.
i
believe
the
legislative
history
of
section
1988
makes
two
things
clear.
first,
congress'
purpose
in
passing
the
legislation
was
to
provide
civil
rights
plaintiffs
with
effective
access
to
the
judicial
process.
secondly,
in
so
doing,
congress'
intend
as
to
any
fees
to
be
awarded
thereunder
were
to
be
adequate
to
attract
competent
counsel
but
not
so
large
as
to
result
in
windfalls
to
the
attorneys
involved.
congress
called
such
fees
reasonable
and
left
it
up
to
the
trial
courts
to
decide
what
a
reasonable
fee
would
be
in
each
individual
case.
since
the
passage
of
section
1988,
however,
this
court
and
other
lower
appellate
courts
have
provided
numerous
guidelines
to
be
followed
by
trial
courts
to
aid
calculation
of
such
fees.
heretofore,
it
appears
that
this
process
required
the
district
court
to
make
two
distinct
calculations.
first,
the
district
court
had
to
determine
the
lodestar
figure,
that
is
the
number
of
hours
reasonably
expended
on
the
litigation
by
a
reasonable
hourly
rate.
secondly,
the
district
courts
had
to
examine
the
relationship
between
the
claims
on
which
counsels'
efforts
were
expended
in
light
of
the
ultimate
relief
which
was
obtained
by
those
efforts.
in
that
regard,
this
court
has
stated
in
hensley
that
where
a
plaintiff
achieved
only
limited
success,
the
district
court
should
award
such
fees
as
are
reasonable
in
relation
to
the
results
obtained
by
the
litigation.
however,
the
fee
award
here,
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
million
dollars,
following
judgments
aggregating
$33,350
in
a
tort
suit
brought
solely
for
the
monetary
benefit
of
the
eight
respondents,
is
not
one
which
under
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
could
be
called
reasonable.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
that
is
correct.
the
claims
for
injunctive
relief
were
dropped
prior
to
trial.
there
were
claims
in
addition
to
declaratory
relief
and
those
were
also
dropped.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
it
would
depend
on
the
nature
of
the
injunctive
relief.
if
the
injunctive
relief
went
no
further
than
the
eight
individuals,
then
i
think
the
case
would
still
be
a
private
litigation
but
certainly
would
have
value
over
and
above
any
monetary
relief
which
was
awarded
and
the
court
could
raise
the
fees.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
is
it
arguable?
yes,
i
think
it
is
arguable.
do
i
think
that
is
necessarily
the
case?
i
would
say
to
that
no
more
than
any
plaintiff's
victory
in
any
type
of
litigation
has
value
to
deter
conduct
by
defendant.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
what
kind
of
litigation
it
would
be.
i
think
to
the
extent
that
this
had
a
public
benefit,
it
would
be
incumbent
upon
the
fee
petitioner
to
prove
that
such
benefit
existed,
since,
after
all,
it
is
the
fee
petitioner
who
is
asking
for
fees.
i
think
it
is
arguable.
whether
it
is
provable
or
not
would
be
up
to
fee
petitioner.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
justice
powell,
i
am
saying
the
record
herein
shows
that
that
finding
is,
on
its
face,
absurd.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
is
absurd.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
yes,
sir.
it
is
certainly
not
based
on
the
record.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
no,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
we
argued
it
was
erroneous.
i
didn't
dare
use
the
word
absurd.
[laughter]
mr.
jonathan
kotler
i
think
the
problem
we
have
in
this
particular
case
is
there
is
a
finding
that
the
time
couldn't
reasonably
be
separated.
certainly
it
couldn't
be
separated
if
all
you
had
to
go
on,
as
the
district
court
did,
were
the
time
records
of
the
respondents.
the
time
records
didn't
separate
time
spent
as
among
any
of
the
defendants
or
on
any
of
the
theories.
so,
i
think
to
that
extent
it
was
impossible
to
separate
out.
i
also
think
though
that
this
court
in
hensley
and
other
cases,
webb
versus
board
of
education,
has
said
that
the
district
court
must
exercise
its
discretion
based
on
time
records,
at
least
up
to
a
certain
level,
and
in
this
particular
case
those
time
records
never
existed
and
there
were
no
findings
made
of
the
quality
of
the
time
records
despite
our
objections
to
the
time
records.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
yes,
i
did.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
there
were
no
motions
to
cut
off
discovery
as
i
recall,
and
there
certainly
were
no
attempts
to
stop
depositions.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
not
in
the
central
district
that
i
am
aware
of.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
i
can
say
that
in
this
particular
case
discovery--
mr.
jonathan
kotler
--the
problem,
justice
powell,
in
this
case
was
that
there
were
not
multiple
discoveries
taken
of
the
same
people.
there
was
always
depositions
of
additional
people,
so
it
wasn't--
mr.
jonathan
kotler
--excuse
me?
mr.
jonathan
kotler
certainly
there
was
discovery
of
all
32
defendants
and
there
were
different
kinds
of
discovery
as
to
all
32
defendants,
but
there
also
was
discovery
taken
of
people
who
were
not
named
as
defendants,
quite
a
bit
of
discovery.
there
wasn't
very
much
discovery
taken
after
1978.
the
case
was
tried
in
1980.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
i
can't
recall
whether
we
did
or
not.
my
recollection
is
that
we
did.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
only
in
terms
of
the
record,
your
honor,
and
the
record...
there
was
nothing--
mr.
jonathan
kotler
--i
don't
think
the
court
is
allowed
to
make
findings
that
are
clearly
erroneous
and
to
that
extent
the
court
is
bound
by
the
record.
i
think
the
record
doesn't
indicate
that
there
were
any
benefits
to
the
public.
certainly
a
finding
that
there
were
important
public
benefits
without
more
is
as
amorphous
as
the
term
reasonable,
i
would
submit.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
i
believe
one
was
one
year
and
one
was
two
or
three
years.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
mr.
chief
justice,
there
was
absolutely
nothing
in
the
record,
not
word
one,
as
to
what
their
normal
billing
rate
was
during
any
period
of
time.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
yes,
sir.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
that
is
correct.
the
only
thing
in
the
record
at
all
with
respect
to
an
hourly
rate,
there
was
a
declaration
by
another
attorney
in
los
angeles,
whose
declaration
never
said
that
he
did
civil
rights
litigation,
never
even
said
that
he
knew
either
of
the
fee
petitioners,
he
said
that
in
his
view
$125
was
a
reasonable
rate,
but
there
was
nothing
more
than
that.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
not
only
do
i
think
that
is
clearly
erroneous,
but
i
can
state
for
a
fact
that
we
did
challenge
that
one
in
the
court.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
i
don't
recall
if
the
court.
of
appeals
made
a
finding
with
respect
to--
mr.
jonathan
kotler
--no,
they
certainly
did
not.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
we
introduced
evidence
that...
basically
attacking
the
affidavit
by
the
one
person
who
filed
an
affidavit
on
their
behalf,
saying
that
that
is
not
sufficient.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
there
was
no
evidence
one
way
or
the
other
as
to
the
prevailing
rate
in
the
community.
we
would
argue
that
a
disproportionate
fee
such
as
here
is
no
less
unreasonable
simply
because
the
losing
party
is
the
one
that
has
to
foot
the
bill.
yet
after
arriving
at
the
lodestar
figure
in
this
case,
the
district
court
failed
to
meet
its
duty
both
under
blum
and
under
hensley
to
adjust
the
lodestar
figure
to
fit
the
degree
of
success
achieved
to
insure
that
the
fee
herein
was
proper,
that
it
was
reasonable.
we
would
argue
that
where
the
lodestar
fee
such
as
here
exceeds
or
equals
the
damages
recovered
by
a
plaintiff
in
a
case
resulting
solely
in
that
form
of
relief
that
the
lodestar
produces
an
unreasonable
fee
and
should
be
reduced.
on
the
other
hand,
the
free
market
test
of
contingency
fee
arrangements
in
general
use
in
a
given
community
not
only
provide
a
more
accurate
reflection
of
the
true
value
of
a
fee
petitioner's
service
in
a
private
tort
action,
which
this
was,
but
also
produces
a
fee
more
consistent
with
the
goals
of
congress
when
it
enacted
section
1988,
again,
a
fee
that
is
reasonable.
for
these
reasons,
petitioners
suggest
the
implementation
of
new
guidelines
to
be
followed
by
district
courts
awarding
fees
under
section
1988,
guidelines,
which
if
adopted,
would
preclude
the
kind
of
result
which
has
occurred
herein.
first,
we
would
ask
that
the
district
court
ascertain
whether
or
not
a
case
was
a
public
case
or
a
private
case.
let
me
explain
what
i
mean.
a
public
case
would
be
one
which
would
demonstrably
result
in
public
benefit;
that
is
a
provable
benefit
to
persons
in
addition
to
the
individual
plaintiffs.
conversely,
a
private
case
would
benefit
only
the
individual
plaintiffs.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
i
am
focusing
on
the
relief,
your
honor,
not
the
defendants,
on
the
relief
obtained
by
the
lawsuit.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
i
don't
think
so,
in
this
case,
there
were
no
policies
or
practices
changed.
if
it
is
found
that
the
matter
is
a
private
litigation,
attorney
fees
would
be
awarded
based
on
the
prevailing
fee
schedule
for
tort
actions,
probably
not
necessarily
on
a
contingency
basis.
of
course,
the
trial
court
would
always
retain
its
discretion
to
adjust
this
amount
up
or
down
to
account
for
the
plaintiff's
degree
of
success.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
nothing.
there
wasn't
one
word.
however,
if
the
district
court
determined
that
the
case
is
one
which
has
provable
benefits,
provable
public
benefits,
that
it
had
achieved
policy
changes
or
resulted
in
vindication
of
civil
rights
of
a
representative
class
of
individuals
over
and
above
the
respondents,
the
fees
could
be
calculated
on
the
existing
lodestar
approach,
again
adjusted
up
or
down
to
account
for
the
degree
of
success.
one
but
not
both
of
these
fee
arrangements
or
these
fee
calculations
would
result
in
a
presumptively
reasonable
fee
depending
on
the
factual
determination
first
made
by
the
trial
court.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
that
i
have
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
yes,
i
do.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
at
the
outset
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
seventh
circuit
two
weeks
ago
in
a
case
called
kirchoff
versus
flynn,
seventh
circuit
no.
85-2187,
set
forth
a
ruling
precisely
of
the
nature
of
the
one
we
want
today.
it
was
a
1988
case
brought
on
1983
claims
for
assault
and
battery.
it
was
a
$25,000
award.
the
request
for
attorney's
fees
was
$50,000
and
the
district
court
in
illinois
awarded
fees
based
on
contingency
in
that
case
reflecting
the
local
policy
for
personal
injury
actions.
the
case
has
just
been
remanded
by
the
seventh
circuit
but
on
other
grounds,
but
in
this
case
they
did
use
the
contingency
basis.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
i
am
sorry,
justice,
it
is
kirchoff,
k-i-r-c-h-o-f-f.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
i
would
be
happy
to.
secondly,
i
beg
to
differ
with
counsel,
but
there
was
no
policy
proven
in
this
case,
no
finding
to
that
effect
either
that
there
was
a
policy
of
the
city
of
riverside
to
do
certain
things.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
yes,
there
was
a
judgment
against--
mr.
jonathan
kotler
--that
these
officers
who
were--
mr.
jonathan
kotler
--i
believe
so.
mr.
jonathan
kotler
they
were
the
persons
who
did
what
they
did.
as
to
whether
they
were...
there
were
no
supervisory
personnel...
the
police
chief,
for
instance,
was
dismissed
from
the
case
by--
mr.
jonathan
kotler
--that
the
city
was
negligent
and
the
city
violated
1983
claims.
second
of
all,
there
were
offers
of
settlement
in
this
case.
there
was
a
second
suit
brought
by
eight
other
people
and
those
claims
were
settled
for
a
total
of
$16,000
in
1977.
and,
finally,
with
respect
to
discovery,
participant
discovery
in
this
case
was
concluded
in
1978.
from
1978
until
the
case
was
tried
in
1980,
there
was
no
meaningful
discovery
taken.
there
was
no
discovery
that
had
to
be
taken.
respondents
were
aware
of
all
the
people
involved
and
what
they
did
as
early
as
1978.
thank
you.
