justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
counsel,
don't
you
start
off
in
trouble
where
the
defendants
are
police
officers?
doesn't
that
automatically
make
it
public?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
saying
that
all
cases
filed
under
1983
have
"social
value"?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
they
win.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and,
if
they
don't
win,
they
don't
have
social
value.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
lopez,
i
would
just
like
to
make
one
statement.
if
you
think
you
are
the
first
one
who
ever
tried
a
lawsuit
in
this
field,
excuse
me.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and,
if
you
can
show
me
some
other
case
of
this
type
that
took
how
many
years?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
took
that
long
to
try,
i
would
like
to
know
of
the
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
took
four
and
a
half
years
of
discovery
i
would
like
to
know.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
mean
a
whole
page?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
could
show
me
one,
i
would
appreciate
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
they
all
in
riverside?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,
they
are
all
in
the
central
district.
that
is
where
you
just
take
discovery
as
long
as
you
want
to.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
hadn't
had
it
that
long,
you
wouldn't
have
had
that
much
of
a
fee,
would
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
