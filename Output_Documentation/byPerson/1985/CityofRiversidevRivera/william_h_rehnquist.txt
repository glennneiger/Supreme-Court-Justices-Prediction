justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
kotler,
you
referred
to
a
private
1983
case.
are
there
public
1983
cases
that
are
different
from
this?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
talking
about
a
case
that
results
simply
in
an
award
of
a
damage
judgment
to
a
particular
individual?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
kotler,
i
thought
a
moment
ago
you
said
that
there
had
been
prayers
for
injunctive
relief,
at
least
at
the
beginning
of
the
suit.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
referring
to,
mr.
lopez,
judge
pfaelzer's
experience
in
private
practice?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
lopez,
you
said
a
moment
ago
you
were
interested
in
what
concerned
my
work
beneath
the
court's
surface
or
something
to
that
effect
and
a
concern
that
at
least
lurks
on
my
part
is
in
my
16
years
of
private
practice
you
could
try
a
case
very,
very
well
for
a
private
client
and
have
every
expectation
of
getting
a
reasonable
fee,
the
client
fully
able
to
pay,
and
if
you
get
a
judgment
for
$35,000
where
perhaps
you
had
expected
a
judgment
for
half
a
million
dollars,
you
simply
cannot
bill
that
client
a
quarter
of
a
million
dollars.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
may
be,
but
are
you
suggesting
then
that
1988
was
simply...
when
it
used
the
term
"reasonable
fee"
was
intending
to
transmute
what
the
normal
experience
in
private
practice
was?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think,
mr.
lopez,
that
understanding
is
the
same
in
the
authorization
for
fee
shifting,
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
the
antitrust
act,
earlier
fee
shifting
statutes?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
withdraw
your
prayer
for
injunction
after
the
jury
verdict
came
in?
