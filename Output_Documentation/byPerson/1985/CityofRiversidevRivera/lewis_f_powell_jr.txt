justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
this
question?
the
district
court
made
findings.
i
have
in
mind
the
one
that
states
this,
that
all
claims
made
by
plaintiffs
listed
on
one
of
the...
it
is
on
page
2-6
of
the
district
court's
decision,
if
i
have
the
right
document,
appendix
ii.
in
any
event,
the
district
court
said
that
time
devoted
to
claims
on
which
the
plaintiffs
did
not
prevail
cannot
reasonably
be
separated
from
the
time
devoted
to
claims
on
which
the
plaintiffs
did
prevail.
you
argue
that
under
hensley
we
still
may
find
despite
that
finding
of
fact
that
the
fee
award
was
not
related
to
the
claims
for
which
it
did
not
prevail?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
that
finding
is
what?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
absurd?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
did
the
court
of
appeals
find
it
clearly
erroneous?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
did
you
argue
that
it
was
absurd
up
there?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and,
two
pages
later,
the
court
of
appeals,
which
i
know
you
don't
like
these
findings,
they
found
the
time
expended
by
plaintiffs'
counsel
in
conducting
this
litigation
was
clearly
reasonable
and
necessary
to
serve
the
public
interest
as
well
as
the
private
interest.
i
think
that
is
still
current
enough
to
ask
you
a
question
about
that.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
this
question?
discovery
went
on
for
four
years.
did
you
object
to
that
at
any
time?
did
you
try
the
case?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
did
the
trial
court
supervise
discovery?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
district
judge
in
the
eastern
district
of
virginia
will
not
permit
discovery
to
go
beyond
six
months
without
his
prior
approval
after
hearing.
does
anything
like
that
every
happen
in
california?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
oh,
really.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
lawyers
will
go
on
forever
in
discovery
as
long
as
they
can
run
up
chargeable
hours.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
all
32
defendants?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
all
32
defendants.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
did
you
introduce
evidence
to
the
effect
that
the
$125
an
hour
was
unreasonable?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but,
you
had
no
evidence
as
to
the
prevailing
rate
in
the
community?
