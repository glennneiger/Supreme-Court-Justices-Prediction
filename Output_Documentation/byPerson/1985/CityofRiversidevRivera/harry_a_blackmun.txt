harry

blackmun
and,
what
was
your
offer
of
settlement?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
twenty-five?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
wasn't
there
some
problem
about
identifying
the
officers
responsible
for
the
unfortunate
fracas?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
would
you
as
an
attorney
have
done
had
you
represented
the
other
side?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
just
as
you
have
refused
to
make
a
larger
offer
and
got
caught
under
the
rule.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
are
all
of
the
officers
still
employed
by
the
city
of
riverside?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
counsel,
one
last
question
and
i
will
stop
interrupting
you.
suppose
they
had
recovered
a
verdict
of
half
a
million
dollars
here,
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so,
the
amount
is
irrelevant
then.
your
seven-times
argument
means
nothing.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
suppose...
my
premise
was,
suppose
the
recovery
was
for
$500,000
and
fees
were
allowed
here
roughly
equal
to...
i
suppose...
what
a
contingency
fee
basis
would
be
in
your
state.
i
don't
know
california
law.
my
question
was
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
and
i
thought
you
answered
that
in
the
affirmative.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
if
they
would
have
recovered
$500,000,
the
original
fee
that
asked
for
was
roughly
equivalent
to
the
amount
of
that
hypothetical
recovery.
they
asked
for
$495,000,
didn't
they?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
was
their
request
if
the
calculations
in
the
record
are
correct.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
lopez,
$316,000
and
some
odd
dollars,
cazares,
$173,000,
law
clerks
and
others
and
miscellaneous,
an
additional
$7,000.
that
adds
up
to
$495,000
that
they
requested.
and
then
the
court
cut
them
approximately
in
half,
didn't
they?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
oh,
i
see.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
four
hundred
and
ninety-five
included
the
multipliers.
