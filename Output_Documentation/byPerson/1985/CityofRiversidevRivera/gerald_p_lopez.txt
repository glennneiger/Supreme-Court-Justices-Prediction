mr.
gerald
p.
lopez
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
remind
you
of
the
formal
question
before
the
court
raised
by
this
case,
whether
or
not
a
fee
award
otherwise
reasonably
calculated
on
the
basis
of
rates
and
hours
should
solely,
as
the
result
of
the
damage
award,
be
reduced?
the
search
for
an
answer
to
this
question
begins
and
ends
with
the
legislative
history.
in
enacting
section
1988,
congress
decided
that
as
a
matter
of
law
all
meritorious
section
1983
claims
have
social
value.
mr.
gerald
p.
lopez
i
think
that
the
size
of
the
verdict,
just
as
is
true
of
the
nature
of
the
right
vindicated,
is
irrelevant
to
the
finding
of
social
value.
the
size
of--
mr.
gerald
p.
lopez
--social
value.
there
is
a
debate
going
on
between
whether
or
not
this
is
a
case
concerning
private
as
opposed
to
public
value.
i
suspect
more
accurately
what
the
debate
is
over
is
whether
or
not
there
is
social
value
for
purposes
of
this
particular
legislation,
not
for
purposes
of
any
other
legislation.
my
position
is
that
be
definition,
when
congress
took
this
court's
invitation
to
decide
whether
or
not
section
1983
cases
and
other
civil
rights
cases
were
important
enough
to
amend
the
american
rule,
that
what
it
concluded
was
that
these
forms
of
cases
when
they
are
meritorious,
and
no
other
circumstance,
by
definition
have
social
value.
mr.
chief
justice,
you
asked
me
the
question
whether
i
might,
and,
of
course,
self-servingly
argue
differently
in
the
event
that
we
had
been
successful
in
some
other
case,
for
example,
with
actual
injuries
and
had
recovered
with
$500,000?
i
would
make
no
different
statement.
mr.
gerald
p.
lopez
if
we
had
recovered
$3
million
in
this
case,
it
would
not
by
definition
add
to
the
social
value
of
the
merit
of
the
case.
what
it
would
do
is--
mr.
gerald
p.
lopez
--by
definition
when
they
concluded
that
these
claims
were
meritorious.
that
is
what
congress
decided
as
a
matter
of
law.
the
size
of
the
verdict
is
relevant.
there
is
no
question
about
that
for
the
best
of
reasons.
congress
made
it
relevant.
congress
said
in
passing
the
statute
that
the
appropriate
standards
were
those
enunciated
in
johnson
and
applied
in
three
specific
cases.
and,
in
those
standards
it
is
true
that
both
the
size
of
the
jury
award,
if
any,
and
the
results
obtained,
are
relevant
to
the
determination
of
whether
or
not
the
hours
expended
were
reasonable
in
light
of
the
results
achieved.
but,
when
you
are
considering
the
monetary
amount,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
social
value.
that
is
decided
when
you
win.
what
it
does
have
to
do
with,
and
quite
relevant
here
too,
is
whether
or
not
in
light
of
your
success
it
can
be
said
that
the
hours
you
have
reasonably
expended
are
justified
in
light
of
the
results
obtained.
now,
if
you
push
the
question
a
little,
you
should
ask
me
what
distinction
am
i
drawing?
what
distinction,
therefore,
is
there
between
the
notion
of
there
is
by
law
social
value
but
there
is,
nonetheless,
important
discretion
to
be
exercised
by
the
district
court
as
announced
by
congress
and
as
pursued
by
this
court
in
hensley
and
webb.
the
distinction
is
that
congress
and
this
court
invited
this
attention
said
we
don't
want
courts,
district
courts
or
the
supreme
court,
to
muck
around
with
the
incredibly
difficult
finding
of
whether
or
not
one
case,
one
right,
one
remedy,
equals
more
social
value
than
another.
what
is
important
in
civil
rights
cases,
as
it
has
been
important
in
antitrust
cases,
in
fair
trade
cases
and
the
like,
is
that
congress
makes
the
decision
as
a
matter
of
national
policy
that
some
classes
of
cases
deserve
national
attention
through
private
litigation.
these
cases
are
important
enough
to
reverse
the
typical
presumption
that
each
side
must
pay
its
own
way,
but
only
if
you
prevail.
when
you
prevail,
there
is
social
value.
the
important
question
that
congress
did
want
the
district
court
to
investigate--
mr.
gerald
p.
lopez
--if,
and
only
if,
they
win.
mr.
gerald
p.
lopez
if,
and
only
if,
they
win.
mr.
gerald
p.
lopez
for
purposes
of
1988
that
is
precisely
right.
that
is
why
the
trigger
for
the
statute
is
prevailing.
let
me
complete
my
thought,
because
it
is
critical
that
a
distinction
that
i
think
is
being
pledged
here.
nonetheless,
the
district
court
has
discretion
not
to
determine
social
value,
but
to
determine,
in
an
insistently
practical
way,
can
it
be
said
in
light
of
what
the
results
were
and
in
light
of
what
was
complained
of
when
this
went
to
trial,
that
the
hours
reasonably
expended
as
calculated
according
to
what
congress
suggested
and
this
court
has
approved,
may
be
said
to
be
reasonable.
that
is
the
hard
work
of
the
district
court.
it
was
those
kinds
of
findings
that
were
made
and
approved
of
by
the
ninth
circuit.
and,
it
is
on
the
basis
of
those
findings,
unless
there
is
a
sufficient
case
they
are
clearly
erroneous,
not
an
insubstantial
matter
to
meet,
that
this
legal
question
is
before
this
court.
mr.
gerald
p.
lopez
i
think
that
is
a
very
tough
practical
question,
both
in
this
case
and
in
any
other
case.
mr.
gerald
p.
lopez
both
go
to
reasonableness,
justice
o'connor.
they
do
not
go
to
social
value
but
they
do
go
to
reasonableness.
let's
take
them
in
order.
hensley
was
a
case,
and
justice
powell's
opinion,
intimately
concerned
itself
with
just
the
first
question
you
asked.
what
happens
when
there
is
something
less
than
total
success,
either
on
the
basis
of
all
the
claims
brought
or
all
the
defendants
sued,
and
it
said
sensibly
these
are
not
easy
matters
but
let
me
provide
you
the
guidance
that
you
might
follow.
if
the
claims
cannot
be
said
to
be
discreet,
which
justice
powell's
opinion
said
would
likely
be
the
case
in
most
civil
rights
cases,
if
they
follow
from
one
story,
one
claim,
more
than
one
claim,
responsibly
litigated
by
the
respondent's
counsel,
plaintiffs'
counsel,
should
be
thought
of
as
overlapping.
then
the
question
becomes
do
they
overlap
sufficiently,
thus
that
it
may
be
fairly
said
that
you
can't
distinguish
between
the
unsuccessful
and
the
successful.
while
i
think
there
are
always
sensible
arguments
to
be
made
by
the
losing
party
which
says
some
of
the
claims
weren't
successful,
others
were,
separate
them...
in
order
to
be
successful
with
that,
you
would
have
to
demonstrate
that
something
in
the
record,
something
in
the
trial
transcript,
which
i
might
add
was
never
ordered
here,
would
justify
the
substance
of
that
claim.
while
the
argument
might
obviously
be
sensible
and,
indeed,
reasonable,
it
was,
after
very
careful
analysis,
and
twice
rejected
by
a
district
court,
a
district
court
that
i
might
add
which
add
probably
significantly
greater
experience
in
major
litigation
and
with
respect
to
police
abuse
than
most
other
district
courts.
the
second
question,
whether
or
not
the
size
of
the
damage
alone
might
itself
be
reason--
mr.
gerald
p.
lopez
--and,
in
her
experience
on
the
police
commission
of
the
city
of
los
angeles,
yes,
both,
your
honor.
the
second
question,
namely
whether
or
not
the
size
of
the
damage
alone,
might
offer
reason
for
the
petitioners
the
losing
defendants
to
argue,
that
the
whole
amount
of
the
order
is
not
reasonable
surely
is
just
the
kind
of
argument
among
11
others
that
this
court,
that
congress
decided
was
relevant
for
what
it
takes
to
determine
the
highly
practical
question
of
what
should
be
awarded
after
winning.
the
key
thing
to
understand,
however,
is
that
when
you
isolate
that
amount
of
money
you
are
not
trying
to
determine
social
value
but
rather
whether
in
light
of
what
the
actual
damage
rules
are,
carey
v.
piphus,
the
injuries
that
were
awarded
some
dollar
amount,
actually
were
awarded
a
dollar
amount,
that
good,
experienced
counsel
might
have
gotten
for
them.
in
this
case,
that
is
precisely
what
the
district
court
found,
namely
that
this
sort
of
injury
is
typically
awarded,
indeed,
something
less
than
what
we
gain
and
in
light
of
the
fact
that
social
value
wasn't
her
job
to
determine,
that
was
gained
through
these
findings
and
through
the
jury's
judgment
justified
the
hours
expended.
if
i
might
elaborate
in
a
slightly
different
way,
while
i
think
that
the
answer
to
the
question
put
before
this
court,
the
reason
this
court
is
concerned
about
the
case,
is
found
within
the
pages
of
the
legislation
and
its
history.
it
occurs
to
me
that
only
slightly
beneath
the
surface
both
of
what
petitioners'
counsel
has
said
and
what
this
court
has
asked
is
the
suspicion
about
what
happened
in
this
case?
is
there
something
that
justifies
what
hours
were
expended
and
justice
powell's
questions
begin
to
link
up
the
kinds
of
things
i
am
concerned
about.
mr.
gerald
p.
lopez
immodesty
aside,
your
honor,
congress
recognized
and
cited
johnson
as
the
case
which
said
that
while
the
years
out
matter,
if
someone
is
good
enough
to
gain
the
kind
of
wage
that
is
typically
paid
to
more
experienced
people,
that
is
what
they
are
to
be
paid.
mr.
gerald
p.
lopez
if
they
were
as
good
as--
mr.
gerald
p.
lopez
--i
think
that
that
varies
depending
on
what
kind
of
firm
you
are
working
for
and
what
kind
of
client
you
are
charging.
but,
the
more
important
thing
to
understand
is
that
is
a
johnson
factor
elaborated
by
this
court
in
hensley
and
it
doesn't
end
on
what
is
the
prevailing
rate
in
light
of
the
number
of
years
of
experience,
but
in
light
of
the
expertise
of
counsel.
mr.
gerald
p.
lopez
it
is
certainly
one
of
the
12
factors
that
is
relevant
to
the
expertise,
to
be
sure,
which
is
why
i
would
like
to
return
to
the
question
of
what
exactly
was
the
product
of
these
many
hours
of
litigation?
for
all
that
was
said
about
what
happened
before
the
district
court,
conspicuously
absent
are
the
findings
of
the
district
court,
a
peculiar
omission,
you
might
understand,
in
light
of
the
challenge
that
one
should
have
to
make
to
them.
in
addition
to
what
justice
powell
underscored,
let
me
just
briefly
iterate
some
of
those
findings
relevant
to
your
consideration
today.
the
district
court
found
that
both
the
city
of
riverside
and
individual
officers,
including
two
of
the
only
three
supervising
officers
involved,
participated
in
lawless,
unconstitutional
conduct.
the
district
court
also
found
that
this
lawless,
unconstitutional
product
was
not
simply
the
product
of
individual
acts,
but
also
the
product
of
racial
animus,
the
product
of
hostility
toward
the
chicano
community
in
the
city
of
riverside.
finally
and
importantly,
the
same
district
court
said
that
this
racially
motivated
police
discrimination,
this
lawless
and
unconstitutional
conduct,
had
to
be
stopped,
and
i
now
quote
the
district
court:
"and
nothing
short
of
a
lawsuit
like
this
could
have
done
this.
"
now,
obviously,
these
findings
by
the
district
court
mirror
what
the
jury
found.
the
jury
found
after
all
that
the
city
of
riverside's
customs
or
policies
themselves
caused
a
constitutional
deprivation.
they
also
found
that
not
only
did
the
individual
police
officers
intentionally
deprived
people
on
constitutional
rights
but
they
did
so
with
malicious
intent,
the
very
predicate
for
the
punitive
damages
that
we
gain.
it
was
on
the
basis
of
those
findings,
on
those
specific
findings
by
the
trier
of
fact
after
four
and
a
half
years
of
discovery
and
nine
days
of
jury
trial,
that
the
district
court
found
that--
mr.
gerald
p.
lopez
--i
think
that
is
often
the
case
in
litigation
outside
the
boundaries
of
fee-shifting
statutes
and
1988
in
particular.
although
i
might
add
that
i
think
there
is
an
empirical
matter.
there
is
some
fairly
strong
suggestion
that
there
are
some
cases
where
the
basis
for
the
amount
charged
is
not
the
damage
recovered,
but
rather
the
hours
expended.
mr.
gerald
p.
lopez
absolutely,
your
honor.
when
1988
was
enacted,
it
had
two
forms
of
fee
understandings
in
mind.
one
was
an
hourly
rate
and
it
concluded
that
most
of
the
people
who
file
civil
rights
claims
typically
can't
pay
the
hourly
rate
of
attorneys.
somewhere
in
there,
i
suspect,
is
your
understanding
in
private
practice
about
what
the
relationship
is
between
what
is
recovered
and
what
may
be
fairly
charged.
the
other
type
was
the
contingency
fee
record;
that
is
the
typical
understanding
which
says,
listen,
for
these
kinds
of
cases
isn't
it
true
that
you
shall
get
a
recovery
that
provides
you
for
taking
out
attorney
fees.
it
also
specifically
found,
congress
that
is,
that
this
simply
wasn't
working
in
civil
rights
claims,
that
as
a
matter
of
empirical
understanding
too
many
of
these
claims
giving
the
damage
rules
that
don't
permit
you
to
easily
evaluate
what
a
constitutional
right
is
worth,
apart
from
physical
injuries,
lead
predictably
to
such
little
money
that
any
sensible
p.i.
type
or
anybody
else
who
is
not
otherwise
funded
or
was
not
incredibly
heroic
in
time
they
are
willing
to
give
away
was
simply
not
taking
the
case.
the
result
of
those
definings
was
to
say
that
much
like
in
many
other
statutes,
it
is
not
simply
civil
rights
statutes,
we
are
going
to
find
that
the
typical
understanding
of
justice
rehnquist's
or
anybody
else's
practice
is
not
what
operates
in
these
cases.
what
operates
in
these
cases
is
we
shall
make
the
plaintiff's
attorney
suffer
the
difficulty
of
deciding
whether
or
not
a
case
is
worth
it,
because
if
it
is
not
going
to
win,
you
can
put
in
four
and
a
half
years
of
stuff
and
nothing
shall
happen,
but
if
it
wins,
if
it
prevails,
the
single
predicate
and
the
critical
one,
then
what
shall
happen
is
you
are
entitled
presumptively
to
a
reasonable
fee.
mr.
gerald
p.
lopez
actually
it
differs
enormously
little
which
is
what
my
study
of
all
the
statutes
suggests;
that
is
the
fee
shifting
statutes
have
actually
gone
back
to
something
like
a
hundred
years
ago.
these
are
not
novel
things,
though
they
typically
weren't
very
common.
what
happened
quickly
over
time,
when
people
began
to
discover
that
as
a
result
of
sometimes
not
terribly
careful
and
sometime
very
careful
empirical
study
the
national
investment
in
particular
kinds
of
rights
wasn't
being
actualized
because
attorneys
simply
weren't
taking
cases.
so,
what
they
decided
typically
was
to
throw
out
normal
understandings
which
weren't
working
and
to
conclude
that
given
that
you
had
to
prevail
that
people
should
otherwise
be
awarded
fees
that
are
reasonable.
your
next
question
i
suppose
should
be
that
you
don't
mean
to
ask
that
we
simply
invite
the
district
court
discretionless
to
take
a
look
at
these
things
and
having
concluded
that
you
prevailed
give
you
all
that
you
have.
i
think
not
and
clearly
congress
never
intended
that,
these
courts'
three
opinion
on
this
question
have
never
said
so,
nor
did
we
act
so
presumptuously
as
to
push
that
either
at
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals.
we
carefully
elaborated
precisely
what
we
thought
we
were
entitled
to
specifically
as
this
court
directed
us
in
light
of
hensley
and
it
was
exactly
that
that
took
into
account
both
the
size
of
the
monetary
damage,
the
total
award,
along
with
the
other
11
features
that
johnson
made
relevant.
so,
while
i
do
think
that
congress
said
you
have
to
throw
out
normal
understanding,
not
only
hourly
rates,
but
most
importantly
the
equivalent
of
what
the
solicitor
general
proposed
and
what
petitioners
now
endorse,
namely,
this
effort
to
relegislate
what
congress
threw
away
as
an
appropriate
interpretation
of
1988,
because
those
aren't
the
way
that
these
kinds
of
cases
shall
be
vindicated
in
the
private
market.
there
is
one
final
glimmer
of
something
that
is
ugly
about
our
performance
here,
perhaps
other
civil
rights
attorneys'
performance,
that
i
think
should
be
made
slightly
more
explicit.
that
is
there
is
either...
and
this
is
probably
the
weaker
of
the
two
notions...
some
sense
that
plaintiffs,
either
in
this
case
or
in
other
cases,
highly
romanticized
what
has
happened
to
them,
that
they
put
a
higher
dollar
figure
than
actual
damage
rules
permit
and,
therefore,
when
confronted
with
sensible
offers,
somehow
refused
them.
coupled
with
that
is
the
idea
of
a
lawyer,
either
who
sees
the
case
as
an
easy
winner
or
for
some
economically
irrational
reason
given
empirical
doubt
about
this
case,
nonetheless
figures
this
is
where
i
shall
gouge.
both
those
concerns,
it
seems
to
me,
follows
from
an
understanding
which
says
either
this
case,
mr.
lopez,
or
these
cases
in
the
aggregate
surely
concern
us
because,
while
you
may
be
right
that
congress
said
this
is
okay,
what
is
happening
is
the
taxpayers
in
general
are
made
to
foot
the
bill
that
is
excessive.
the
focus
is
then,
you,
mr.
lopez,
somehow
justify
what
is
going
on
here.
aren't
you
the
party
that
decided
that?
this
is
the
way
it
had
to
be
litigated,
you
put
too
much
time
and
charge
too
high
a
rate,
etcetera.
while
i
think
the
concern
is
immensely
justified,
i
think
the
focus
is
badly
skewed.
the
party
that
had
most
to
do
with
this
case
going
on
and
on
was
not
the
plaintiffs
but
the
defendants.
the
defendants
were
the
ones
after
all,
and
i
speak
now
of
both
the
city
of
riverside
and
the
individual
defendants,
who
decided
that
after
the
filing
of
the
administrative
complaint,
before
a
federal
lawsuit
was
ever
in
mind,
never
to
respond
by
saying
that
in
light
of
what
was
done,
ultimately
unconstitutional
and
lawless,
we
shall
both
apologize
and
offer
you
something
like
what
was
actually
the
damages
here.
the
defendants
were
the
ones
that,
after
refusing
to
make
that
offer
after
the
administrative
complaints
were
filed,
then
pursued
without
probable
cause
of
finding
of
the
district
court
the
longest
misdemeanor
trial
in
the
history
of
the
city
of
riverside
simply
to
avoid
having
the
lack
of
probable
cause
finding
against
them.
the
defendants
were
the
one
who,
after
the
filing
of
the
suit
and
for
some
four
a
half
years,
as
a
matter
of
the
finding
of
the
district
court,
never
made
a
sensible
offer.
the
defendants
were
the
ones,
and
perhaps
this
is
most
critical,
most
critical
in
light
of
justice
stevens'
opinion
in
marek
v.
chesney
and
the
operation
of
rule
68,
the
defendants
were
the
ones
who
decided
never
to
make
an
offer
of
judgment
to
both
the
plaintiffs
and
the
plaintiffs'
attorneys
who
they
now
describe
as
gouging,
an
offer
of
judgment
that
would
have
foreclosed
the
capacity
to
gain
costs
if,
in
fact,
the
jury's
verdict
were,
indeed,
less
than
what
the
offer
was,
costs
in
light
of
marek,
including
attorneys'
fees.
when
that
is
the
behavior
of
defendants,
then
you
have
little
doubt
about
why
it
took
four
and
a
half
years
to
try
and
get
information
that
was
solely
in
the
hands
of
the
defendant
and
why
you
went
to
trial
on
a
case
where
we
knew
too,
in
light
of
carey
v.
piphus
and
the
actual
damage
rule,
that
it
was
immensely
likely
that
the
damage
award
would
be
small.
what
was
important
nonetheless
was
that
these
clients
were
treated
disrespectfully,
not
as
a
highly
romanticized
matter,
but
as
a
kind
of
insistently
practical
matter
because
all
they
were
asking
was
not
to
be
treated,
because
they
were
chicanos
in
a
place
where
they
lived
and
worked,
in
an
incredibly
and
institutionally
discriminatory
fashion
so
that
the
judgment,
a
monetary
judgment
to
be
sure,
was
thought
to
subsume
the
important
social
value
and
the
deterrent
value
that
at
least
thus
far
in
this
argument
has
been
presumed
solely
to
follow
from
either
declaratory
relief
or
an
injunction.
and,
if
there
is
concern
about
what
the
taxpayers
have
to
pay
here,
taxpayers
who
include
my
clients,
i
will
add,
then
the
real
scrutiny
ought
to
be
of
defendants
and
defendants'
behavior
in
these
kinds
of
cases,
particularly
when
they
have
all
the
tools
to
put
an
end
to
it.
if
they
fail
to
take
advantage
of
it,
it
hardly
strikes
me
as
an
appropriate
argument
or
at
least
one
you
ought
not
make
without
significant
embarrassment
to
then
claim
that
plaintiffs'
counsel
are
the
ones
who
gouged
and
plaintiffs
are
themselves
the
highly
romanticized
unrealistic
people
who
don't
know
that
a
case
actually
isn't
worth
much.
mr.
gerald
p.
lopez
in
our
brief
we
clarify
what
was
actually
an
incorrect
statement,
both
by
petitioners'
counsel
today
and
in
the
in-chambers
opinion,
that
we
did
not
drop
the
request
for
injunction
before
trial.
rather,
we
waited
until
the
evidence
came
in
and
decided
on
our
own
that
we
got
what
we
wanted
in
the
judgment
against
both
the
city
for
customs
and
policies
that
violated
constitutional
rights
and
against
individuals
that
included
punitives.
we
presupposed,
which
is
precisely
what
this
court
has
invited
us
to
presuppose
in
fourth
amendment
cases
and
many
other
kinds
of
cases,
that
damage
awards
have
social
value
and
were
deterrents.
the
judge
nonetheless--
mr.
gerald
p.
lopez
--we
dropped
it
for
the
best
of
reasons,
we
thought
we
got
what
we
wanted
and
that
in
light
of
the
pervasiveness
of
the
lawless
and
unconstitutional
conduct--
mr.
gerald
p.
lopez
--oh,
precisely
the
opposite
as
perhaps
you
should
know
best
in
light
of
your
opinion
in
o'shea
and
in
light
of
justice
rehnquist's
opinion
in
rizzo
and
then
your
later
opinion
in
lyons.
mr.
gerald
p.
lopez
we
did.
we
absolutely
proved
under
monell,
which
is
the
standard
for
demonstrating
municipal
liability,
that
they
had
a
policy
that
lead
to
this
unconstitutional
conduct.
mr.
gerald
p.
lopez
well,
in
light
of
lyons,
though
i
unfortunately
disagree
with
you,
you
concluded
that
though
there
is
a
policy
in
place,
unless
you
can
demonstrate
with
some
reasonable
certainty
that
you
shall
again
be
the
product
of
the
unconstitutional
policy,
that
you
are
not
entitled
to
an
injunction.
indeed,
this
is
justice
marshall's
argument
in
the
dissent.
mr.
gerald
p.
lopez
yes,
we
did.
in
fact,
to
clarify
the
record
yet
still,
it
was
the
district
court
that
invited
our
attention,
perhaps
thinking
as
justice
white
does,
to
whether
or
not
we
wanted
it,
because
it
was
her
disposition,
again
made
explicit
on
the
record,
that
she
was
inclined
to
give
us
an
injunction
and
it
was
at
that
point
that
i
said
on
the
record
that
the
only
kind
of
injunction
i
thought
was
appropriate
was
the
tautological
one,
please
ask
the
city
and
the
individual
defendants
to
obey
the
constitution.
the
typical
presumption
is
local
governments
as
much
as
federal
government
care
enough
about
the
constitution
to
obey
it
and
it
was
on
that
understanding
in
light
of
the
case
law
that
i
decided
that
the
judgment
we
got
did
what
we
wanted
and
why
invite
some
mess
that
actually
accomplished
nothing
more
than
what
we
wanted.
mr.
gerald
p.
lopez
yes,
it
was,
justice
white.
mr.
gerald
p.
lopez
for
the
best
of
reasons,
because
congress,
both
in
the
senate
report
and
the
house
report,
the
senate
report
at
page
five,
i
think,
and
the
house
report
at
page
seven,
affirmed
by
this
court
in
maher
v.
gagne,
says
that
you
are
entitled
to
both
recovery
on
the
basis
of
your
winning
pendent
claim
as
well
as
on
your
winning
civil
rights
claim
so
there
was
little
question--
mr.
gerald
p.
lopez
--i
am
not
the
first
and
i
am
certain
i
am
not
the
best,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
p.
lopez
it
took
four
and
a
half
years,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
p.
lopez
it
took
four
and
a
half
years
for
discovery,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
p.
lopez
i
would
gladly
submit
a
quite
lengthy
list
of
those
cases
even
in
the
central
district,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
p.
lopez
if
you
would
like
it,
your
honor,
i
would
be
happy
to
do
that.
mr.
gerald
p.
lopez
actually
there
are
some
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
gerald
p.
lopez
no,
they
are
in
the
central
district,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
p.
lopez
hardly.
it
why
you
take
discovery
when
the
information
is
not
forthcoming
because
of
intransigent
politics
and
strategies
on
the
part
of
the
defendants
which
we,
as
much
as
anyone,
wish
would
not
happen.
it
is
hardly
a
matter
that
you
want
to
pile
up
time
when
you
don't
know
if
you
are
going
to
win.
mr.
gerald
p.
lopez
if
they
hadn't
tried
to
avoid
what
we
are
trying
to
learn,
we
certainly
wouldn't
have
been
in
there
that
long.
i
entirely
agree.
mr.
gerald
p.
lopez
petitioners,
both
here
and
in
their
brief,
ignore
both
what
congress
did
and
what
the
district
court
found.
now,
that
may
well
make
their
argument
that
much
easier,
but
it
hardly
strikes
me
as
a
good
reason
for
this
court
to
relegislate
what
congress
has
already
decided.
the
district
court
did
precisely
what
you
asked
on
remand
after
hensley.
it
carefully
reconsidered
the
record
and
most
specifically
decided
that
it
must
reconsider
the
relationship
between
the
results
obtained
and
the
amount
of
hours
expended.
that
kind
of
careful
work
ought
not
easily
be
deprecated
by
deciding
to
do
anything
but
affirm
on
the
basis
of
arguments
that
have
no
basis
in
the
legislative
history
as
a
matter
of
what
went
on
in
litigation
or
even
as
an
empirical
matter.
thank
you.
