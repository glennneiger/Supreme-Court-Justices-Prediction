justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kotler,
can
i
ask
you
a
question,
because
i
am
a
little
confused
in
view
of
your
discussion
with
justice
blackmun.
you
are
making
two
different
arguments
as
i
understand.
one,
you
are
saying
there
was
a
lot
of
time
spent
in
litigating
people
who
were
innocent
and
i
gather
in
effect
they
were
compensated
for
time
that
they
shouldn't
be
paid
for.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
would
be
true
however
big
the
verdict
was,
is
that
not
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
one
argument.
your
second
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
even
if
all
the
time
is
properly
computed,
there
is...
are
you
arguing
as
a
matter
of
law
you
may
never...
the
lawyer
may
never
be
paid
more
than
the
client?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
would
you
ask
them
to
put
on
evidence
in
effect
that
if
they
had
to
go
out
and
raise
money...
every
now
and
then
you
read
in
the
paper
about
someone
who
is
raising
money
to
finance
an
important
piece
of
litigation...
he
should
get
paid
what
a
competent
counsel
would
charge
if
a
war
chest
were
created
for
him
or
what
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
would
always
mean
the
fee
would
have
to
be
less
than
the
recovery
because
contingent
fees
are
always
paid
out
of
the
recovery
then.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
if
that
is
the
test...
isn't
it
true
in
california
also
that
contingency
fees
are
general
a
percentage
of
the
recovery?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
what
would
you
do
with
a
case
like
carey
against
piphus
where
the
court
says
there
is
a
one
dollar
nominal
damage
or
just
say
there
are
not
fees
in
those
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
not
in
a
case
like
this
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
are
really
telling
me
two
different
things.
i
thought
you
first
said
that
if
you
start
that
way
you
end
up
on
a
contingent
fee
approach
which
requires
the
fee
to
be
less
than
the
award.
now
you
are
saying
all
you
do
is
start
there
and
then
if
that
doesn't
seem
fair
the
district
judge
can
then
approach
it
from
a
lodestar
point
of
view.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
it
is
not
absolute,
why
isn't
it
fair
to
infer
in
this
case...
the
district
judge
looked
at
it
and
said,
well,
in
view
of
the
time
spent
the
lawyers
have
to
get
more
than
$30,000
and
the
only
way
we
can
figure
out
how
to
do
it
is
to
move
on
to
a
lodestar.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
do
with
a
nominal
damage
case
then
if
that
is
the
result,
a
dollar?
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
may
10
or
15
or
something
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kotler,
on
the
second
finding
that
justice
powell
mentioned
about
the
case
serving
the
public
interest,
did
you
challenge
that
finding
in
the
court
of
appeals?
it
seems
to
me
it
goes
to
the
theory
of
your
case
in
this
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
would
you
not
agree
that
we
have
to
accept
that
as
a
valid
finding
of
fact
for
purposes
of
our
decision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
can
go
behind
it
and
read
through
the
record
and
decide
whether
we
agree.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
there
is
a
finding,
is
there
not,
no.
13,
that
that
is
the
hourly
rate
typical
in
the
market
for
comparable
service
by
comparable
lawyers?
do
you
think
that
is
clearly
erroneous
too?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and,
did
the
court
of
appeals
agree
with
you
or
disagree
with
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
least
they
didn't
set
the
finding
aside.
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
the
city
held
liable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
what
theory
if
there
was
no
policy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
respondent
superior?
