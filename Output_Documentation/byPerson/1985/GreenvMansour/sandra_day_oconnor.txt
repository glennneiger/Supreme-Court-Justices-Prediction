perhaps
it
would
apply
if
there
were
a
finding
of
a
continuing
violation,
which
is
not
the
case
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
point
being
that
perhaps
there
could
be
continuing
violations
and
prospective
relief
as
to
those
to
which
notice
could
properly
be
given.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
we
don't
take
it
on
that
record,
of
course,
i
assume,
do
we?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
conceivably,
that
could
explain
or
distinguish
the
quern
decision
in
any
event.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
the
finding
there
was
with
relation
to
a
continuing
violation--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--under
the
notice.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
does
cause
one
to
wonder
whether
the
declaratory
judgment
isn't
being
sought
in
effect
to
determine
liability,
and
just
leave
enforceability
to
state
courts
to
determine
statutory
time
bars
or
that
sort
of
thing.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
is
the
point.
if
the
state
has
violated
federal
law
and
the
declaratory
judgment
reveals
that
payment
should
have
been
made
under
federal
law,
then
that
in
effect
determines
state
liability,
and
what
is
left
is
really
a
determination
in
state
court
of
enforceability,
and
that
might
turn
on
what
the
statute
of
limitations
might
provide
or
what
remedial
limitations
there
might
be
at
the
state
level.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
that
is
the
case,
then
it
does
seem
to
be
very
close
to
edelman,
when
you
are
really
providing
a
form
of
financial
relief,
in
effect
retroactively.
