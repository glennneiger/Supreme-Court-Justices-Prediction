mr.
william
burnham
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
reserve
five
minutes
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
this
case
is
actually
comprised
of
two
section
1983
class
actions.
the
claims
in
the
cases
are
essentially
that
the
defendant
state
official
violated
the
plaintiff's
statutory
rights
under
title
4(d)
of
the
social
security
act,
thereby
depriving
them
of
afdc
benefits
to
which
they
were
entitled.
the
two
cases
factually
parallel
each
other.
however,
i
will
indicated
briefly
what
those
were.
the
cases
were
filed
in
1980
and
1981.
the
first
case,
denominated
michigan
welfare
rights
organization
versus
dempsey
originally,
is
the
child
care
expense
case,
in
which
michigan
in
concluding
an
afdc
budget
refused
to
allow
a
deduction
for
the
expenses
of
child
care
which
were
necessary
to
be
paid
for
the
recipient
to
go
to
work.
this,
petitioners
believe,
violated
clear
pre-october,
1981,
federal
law.
this
court
has
decided
a
case
on
that
very
issue,
shea
versus
vialpando.
the
department
of
health
and
human
services,
which
is
charged
with
administration
of
the
act,
wrote
michigan
several
letters
telling
them
essentially
that,
and
they
nonetheless
did
not
change
the
policy.
however,
in
october,
1981,
federal
law
changed,
and
federal
law
continued
the
requirement
that
there
be
deductions
allowed.
however,
michigan
changed
its
regulation
to
comply
with
the
new
federal
law.
the
reason
for
that
presumably
was
because
the
new
federal
law
imposed
a
limitation
of
$160
a
month,
and
michigan
believed,
i
suppose,
that
it
could
live
with
that,
and
therefore
changed
its
policy
to
comply
with
the
new
federal
law.
the
other
case,
benas
versus
dempsey--
mr.
william
burnham
--after
the
change,
the
defendants,
we
would
submit,
are
currently
in
compliance
with
the
new
federal
law.
consequently,
what
remains
is
our
request
for
summary
judgment
as
to
the
defendant's
compliance
with
federal
law
before
october
of
1981,
and
the
issue,
but
relief
may
be
granted
based
upon
that
determination.
mr.
william
burnham
we
are
not
seeking
any
monetary
relief
at
all.
we
are
not
seeking
damages.
all
we
are
seeking
is
a
declaratory
judgment
or
some
other
substantive
federal
question
determination,
and
an
injunctive
order
requiring
the
defendant
to
send
notice
relief
as
was
done
in
the
case
of
quern
versus
jordan,
which
this
court
decided
in
1979.
mr.
william
burnham
well,
the
case
is
not
moot.
it
is
our
position
the
case
is
not
moot.
first
of
all,
the
sixth
circuit
found
that
it
was
not
moot,
and
we
believe
that
that
analysis
is
in
fact
correct,
although
they
decided
against
us
on
the
eleventh
amendment
issue.
in
order
to
be
moot,
of
course,
under
garrity,
there
must
be
a
lack
of
any
cognizable
legal
interest,
and
the
issues
are
no
longer
live.
under
this
circumstances,
the
issues
are
clearly
live.
mr.
william
burnham
we
want
the
notice,
and
there
is
an
interest
in--
mr.
william
burnham
--well,
probably
in
the
state
administrative
tribunal.
mr.
william
burnham
to
state
it
more
specifically,
we
believe
that
the
interest
is
in
being
given
the
opportunity
to
do
that.
in
other
words,
class
members
may
decide
that
they
do
not
want
to
pursue
that
remedy,
or
they
may
decide
that
they
do.
if
they
do
pursue
that
remedy,
they
may
not
be
able
to
actually
get
an
award
of
retroactive
benefits
because
of
state
law.
mr.
william
burnham
i
understand.
mr.
william
burnham
well,
petitioners
would
respectfully
disagree.
this
case
is
in
no
different
position
than
the
case
of
quern
versus
jordan
was
in
1979.
in
quern
versus
jordan,
the
issue
involved
was
a
question
of
whether
or
not
notice
really
could
be
ordered.
and
in
this
case,
the
entire
program
to
which
the
relief
could
have
related
had
been
abolished
for
over
a
year
by
the
time
the
district
court
considered
notice
of
relief
and
had
been
abolished
for
approximately
four
years
by
the
time
that
this
court
approved
the
notice
of
relief.
however,
in
the
case,
and
i
think
it
is
an
indication
of
how
that
case
was
still
alive,
in
that
case
this
court
affirmed
an
en
banc
seventh
circuit
decision
saying
that
notice
really
should
be
ordered,
and
after
notice
of
relief
was
ordered,
in
fact,
the
class
members,
some
of
them,
filed
for
administrative
bearings,
and
then
after
they
had
exhausted
their
administrative
remedies,
went
to
the
illinois
court
of
claims,
and
in
fact
were
able
to
get
an
award
of
benefits.
now,
that
award
of
benefits,
of
course,
was
under
state
law
as
a
result
of
actions
taken
by
the
state
courts.
mr.
william
burnham
there
were
no...
well,
quern
was
edelman
versus
jordan
revisited.
consequently
there
was
originally
a
request
for
equitable
restitution,
in
other
words,
a
direct
award
that
the
state
pay
those
benefits.
this
court
in
edelman
versus
jordan,
of
course,
held
that
that
violated
the
eleventh
amendment.
on
remand
to
the
district
court
in
quern,
the
district
court
and
the
seventh
circuit
agreed
that
no
such
order,
of
course,
direct
order
to
pay
benefits
would
be
entered.
however,
limited
injunctive
relief
requiring
that
a
notice
be
provided
of
the
availability
of
state
administrative
remedies
could
in
fact
be
ordered,
and
that
was
the
context
in
which
it
arose.
in
other
words,
this
case
is
just
like
quern
in
the
sense
that
there
is
no
current
live
claim
for
an
injunction
against
future
violations.
however,
there
are
live
claims
for
past
violations
and
for
notice
relief
to
allow
the
claims
the
opportunity
to
seek
redress
for
those
past
violations.
mr.
william
burnham
that
depends
on
how
one
interprets
the
term
"prospective".
mr.
william
burnham
well,
justice
powell,
the
understanding
of
prospective
relief,
if
i
understand
the
question
correctly,
prospective
injunctive
relief
against
future
violations,
there
is
no
claim
for
that.
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
burnham
and
no
claim
for
damages.
mr.
william
burnham
it
may
if
the
individual
class
member
who
received
that
notice
decided
that
they
wanted
to
take
advantage
of
it
and
at
that
point
to
request
an
administrative
hearing,
and
then
to
get
judicial
review
of
that
administrative
hearing
decision.
under
michigan
law,
administrative
hearings
are
available
in
the
circumstance.
they
are,
of
course,
compelled
by
federal
law.
in
other
words,
michigan
may
not
have
an
afdc
program
unless
it
has
a
system
of
hearings.
mr.
william
burnham
i
believe...
your
honor,
i
believe,
is
referring
to
the
statement
in
quern
about
the
notice
being
ancillary
to
prospective
relief
already
ordered.
mr.
william
burnham
the
defendant's
and
the
sixth
circuit's
interpretation
of
that
is
that
that
referred
to
the
permanent
injunction,
which
of
course
had
in
the
intervening
time
become
moot
because
of
the
abolition
of
the
program
to
which
it
related.
it
is
our
view
that
that
phrase
simply
refers
to
the
way
that
the
word
"ancillary"
is
used
in
eleventh
amendment
jurisprudence.
in
other
words,
a
full
statement
distinguishes
between
the
notice
that
was
approved
by
the
en
banc
court
of
appeals
and
the
notice
that
was
approved
by
the
district
court.
and
the
court
was
in
essence
saying
the
notice
approved
by
the
district
court
was
not
ancillary,
but
the
notice
of
proof
by
the
court
of
appeals
was
ancillary.
well,
if
in
fact
the
sixth
circuit's
reading
of
ancillary
is
correct,
that
would
make
no
sense,
because
those
notices,
the
only
difference
in
the
notices
was
the
form
of
the
notice,
and
the
fact
that
it
could
be
ordered
was
the
same
in
both
situations,
both
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
court
of
appeals.
consequently,
taking
that
data,
it
is
quite
clear
that
it
could
not
have
referred
to
ancillary
power
to
enter
that
kind
of
relief.
it
could
only
refer
to
the
usual
meaning
of
ancillary,
which
is
that
the
effect
of
that
relief
was
ancillary
to
a
proper
substantive
federal
question
determination.
mr.
william
burnham
under
the
facts
of
jordan?
mr.
william
burnham
in
this
case,
the
declaratory
judgment
is
proper--
mr.
william
burnham
--yes,
that
would
be
the
purpose
of
the
declaratory
judgment.
mr.
william
burnham
well,
the
purpose
would
be
to
settle
the
rights
of
the
parties.
mr.
william
burnham
well,
no.
i
would
say
that
the
notice
of
relief
may
be
ordered
without
any
formal
declaratory
judgment.
mr.
william
burnham
well,
in
the
same--
mr.
william
burnham
--well,
in
the
sense
that
any
injunction
is
ordered
based
upon
a
determination
that
the
law
was
violated,
there
was
no
need
for
separate
declaratory
relief.
in
other
words,
a
federal
court
may
enter
an
injunction,
an
affirmative
injunction,
without
necessarily
entering
declaratory
relief.
mr.
william
burnham
that's
correct,
and
consequently
one
has
to
at
that
point
separate
the
determinative
federal...
substantive
federal
question
determination
from
the
issue
of
the
injunction.
mr.
william
burnham
at
least
in
effect
one
would
have
to
do
that,
yes.
but
this
is
no
different
than
any
other--
mr.
william
burnham
--well,
it
is
prospective
in
the
sense
that...
in
the
sense
that
the
federal
determination,
the
federal
question
of
determination
determines
how
it
is
that
in
the
future
the
state
will
have
to
deal
with
past
claims.
mr.
william
burnham
of
course.
i
am
not
saying
that
the
money
would
necessarily
be...
in
other
words,
i
am
not
saying
that
just
because
actions
are
going
to
be
taken
in
the
future,
that
it
is
prospective.
mr.
william
burnham
what
i
am
saying
is
that
in
order
to
be
prospective,
the
relief
must
be
based
upon
some
ongoing
federal
duty,
and
if
there
is
an
ongoing
federal
duty
to
take
action
with
respect
to
past
claims,
which
there
is
in
the
federal
statute
and
the
federal
regulations,
then
an
order
enforcing
that
ongoing
duty
can
in
fact
be
prospective.
mr.
william
burnham
that
could
be,
but
this
case
does
not
involve--
mr.
william
burnham
--that's
correct,
and
we
are
not
dealing
with
monetary
relief,
and
for
that
reason--
mr.
william
burnham
--well,
that
was
precisely
the
argument
that
was
made
to
this
court
in
quern,
that
in
fact
this,
the
quern
case,
after
it
came
back
with
notice
relief,
was
no
different
than
edelman,
and
this
court
made
the
distinction
between
an
order
which
propels
the
state
to
pay
money
and
an
order
which
simply
determines
illegality
and
orders
some
nonmonetary
relief.
mr.
william
burnham
yes,
it
did.
i--
mr.
william
burnham
--okay.
the
prospective
relief,
if
in
fact
this
comment
means
something
beyond
what
the
court
had
said
in
the
previous
paragraph,
that
in
fact
the
prospective
relief
is
a
substantive
federal
question
determination
that
in
this
case
michigan
violated
federal
law
before
october
1st.
mr.
william
burnham
well,
this
court
made
clear
in
quern
that
whatever
the
class
members
were
going
to
do
with
the
notice,
and
going
to
do
with
the
substantive
federal
question
determination
necessary
for
it
did
not
really
affect
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
notice
relief
order
should
be
entered.
it
is
our--
mr.
william
burnham
--yes,
i
believe
it
is,
because
otherwise
what
is
going
to
happen
in
this
case
is
that
without
that
declaratory
judgment,
the
state
may
treat
any
action
that
it
took
in
the
past
as
valid.
mr.
william
burnham
that
is,
of
course,
possible,
but
in
this
case
we
have
in
fact,
we
would
have
a
delay
between
the
time
that
a
state
court
will
render
a
decision,
and
we
have
in
fact
persons
who
received
benefits
under
preliminary
injunction.
if
no
final
judgment
is
entered
saying
that
they
in
essence
directly
receive
those
benefits
under
the
preliminary
injunction,
then
the
state
is
open
to...
those
benefits,
because
they
may
treat
the
actions
that
they
had
taken
as
having
been
legal
during
that
time,
despite
the
fact
that
there
was
a
preliminary
injunction.
this
court
in
edgar
versus
white
rejected
the
idea
that
in
fact
there
is
some
immunity
because
of
that,
and
the
state
is
certainly
open
to
do
that.
now,
they
have,
to
grant
them,
they
have
disclaimed
any
interest
in
doing
that.
i
would
submit
that
that
is
solely
for
the
purpose
of
saying,
well,
this
matter
is
really
completely
moot.
mr.
william
burnham
i
am
asking
the
court
to
give
us
relief,
and
that
the
relief
is
complete
upon
its
being
given,
because
the
relief,
the
interest
the
class
members
have
is
an
interest
in
the
opportunity
to
apply
for
that
hearing.
mr.
william
burnham
it
may
be
used
in
the
michigan
state
court.
mr.
william
burnham
no,
it
could
be
used
in
the
michigan
administrative
tribunal.
if
they
win
there,
they
don't
have
to
go
to
the
michigan
state
court,
no.
mr.
william
burnham
they
would
have
to...
i
would
think
that
the
usual
rules
of
collateral
estoppel
would
apply
to
issues
that
are
actually
adjudicated.
that
would
not
prevent
the
state
from
interposing
some
other
defense,
for
example,
its
own
sovereign
immunity.
it
could
in
fact
say
that
the
claim
are
time
barred,
as
it
has
claimed
in
this
case.
any
number
of
ways
that
in
fact
the
plaintiff
would
be...
would
not
be
able
to
get
a
final
judgment
actually
awarding
them
money.
but
what
is
important
in
the
case
is
that
in
fact
they
have
an
adjudication
which
settles
the
rights
of
the
parties,
and
they
get
the
opportunity.
if
they
want
to
avail
themselves
of
that
opportunity,
they
have
the
opportunity
to
have
a
readjudication
of
whether
or
not
they
were
entitled
to
those
benefits
if
they
seek
that
readjudication.
mr.
william
burnham
i
don't
believe
it
is
pendent
jurisdiction
simply
because
that
notice
relief
stands
on
its
own...
in
other
words,
notice
relief
should
be
no
different
than
any
other
kind
of
injunctive
relief
which
is
nonmonetary.
an
example
would
be
a
state
university
student
who
is
expelled
for
a
period,
or
a
public
employee
who
is
dismissed.
it
could
well
be
that
that
dismissal
period
is
over,
and
in
fact
they
are
back
on
the
job
by
the
time
that
they
start
their...
by
the
time
that
their
lawsuit
is
filed.
in
that
case,
it
would
be
very
injust
to
have
the
district
court
say
that
it
can't
do
anything.
the
disciplinary
record
might
be
disseminated
to
other
employers.
it
may
in
fact
follow
the
person
throughout
their
tenure
there.
consequently,
the
district
court
should
have
the
power
to
enter
nonmonetary
relief--
mr.
william
burnham
--yes.
mr.
william
burnham
if
your
honor
is
referring
to
the
younger
versus
harris,
samuels
versus
mckell
sort
of--
mr.
william
burnham
--yes.
mr.
william
burnham
yes,
in
the
mcnary
case.
mr.
william
burnham
well,
i
believe
that
there
are
distinctions
between
the
anti-injunction
statutes
on
the
one
hand
and
the
eleventh
amendment
on
the
other.
it
is
petitioners'
view
that
the
eleventh
amendment
does
not
bar
a
determination
of
past
misconduct,
but
in
fact
the
eleventh
amendment
only
bars
certain
kinds
of
relief
based
upon
that,
and
in
fact
a
violation
of
federalism
or
a
violation
of
the
statute
that
might
occur
occurs
just
because
of
the
determination,
and
in
the
eleventh
amendment
case
that
is
not
the
case.
there
are
numerous
situations
were
the
federal
court
adjudicates
the
legality
of
past
misconduct,
but
so
long
as
relief
is
entered
that
does
not
violate
the
eleventh
amendment,
that
is
okay.
mr.
william
burnham
yes.
mr.
william
burnham
prospective
relief,
even
though
it
cost
money.
mr.
william
burnham
that
is
true.
mr.
william
burnham
something
along
that
line
could
be
argued.
in
other
words,
it
should
make
no
difference
whether
or
not
the
notice
relief
is
sought
by
itself
of
sought
in
conjunction
with
a
future
looking
injunction.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
facts
of
quern
versus
jordan
illustrate
that
beautifully.
in
fact,
there
were
two
separate
groups
of
persons
involved,
the
persons
who
were
going
to
apply
after
the
final
judgment
and
the
group
of
people
of
which
mr.
jordan
was
a
member
who
had
already
applied
before
judgment,
and
as
a
member
who
had
already
applied
before
judgment,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
mr.
jordan
had
litigated
for
some
eight
years,
and
had
gotten
no
relief.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
was
not
covered
by
any
of
the
relief
in
that
case
until
notice
relief
was
entered.
mr.
william
burnham
that's
correct.
that
is
one
difference
in
that
case.
it
was
in
fact
originally
ordered--
mr.
william
burnham
--well,
if
that
logic
were
applied,
then
there
would
be
no
situations
that
one
could
think
of
where
notice
relief
would
be
appropriate.
for
example,
the
appropriate
substantive
federal
question
determination
to
support
notice
relief
would
have
to
be
that
the
defendants
had
violated
the
plaintiff's
rights
in
the
past.
mr.
william
burnham
now,
that...
if
a
prospective
injunction
is
entered,
that
is
not
a
necessary
basis
for
that
prospective
injunction.
consequently,
one...
award
of
it
even
where
there
is
a
prospective
injunction,
you
can't
order
notice
relief
because
there
has
been
no
relevant
finding
of
past
misconduct.
so,
the
only
situation
that
notice
relief
would
apply
would
be
the
peculiar
facts
of
edelman,
where
the
district
court
makes
a
mistake
and
enters
the
wrong
kind
of
order
first,
gets
reversed,
and
then
says,
okay,
now
i
will
enter
a
notice
relief.
that
would
be
the
only
situation.
mr.
william
burnham
if
there
were
a
finding
of
a
continuing
violation,
one
could
argue
that
that
only
determines
that
from
that
date
of
judgment
forward
the
defendant
is
violating
federal
law.
again,
that
doesn't
give
us
any
determination
as
to
what
the
status
of
that
conduct
was
in
the
past.
it
is
always
necessary
to--
mr.
william
burnham
--that
is
correct,
and
this
case
presents
a
very
unusual
situation
that
way,
because
i
just
found
out
as
of
last
friday
the
state
is
in
fact
violating
current
federal
law
on
stepparent
asset
assumption.
and--
mr.
william
burnham
--no,
we
don't,
but
i
would...
i
believe
that
that...
that
indicates
just
how
illogical
it
is
to
somehow
tie
notice
relief,
if
in
fact,
if
in
fact
we
were
able
to
show
that,
if
we
tie
notice
relief
to
an
injunction
that
is
based
upon
a
violation
of
a
totally
different
federal
law
or
a
totally
different
class
of
people
and
somehow
say
that
just
because
we
can
say
that
is
ancillary
to
that
it
is
okay,
that
is
not
a
very
firm
basis
on
which
to
base
a
belief.
mr.
william
burnham
on
the
facts
of
this
case?
mr.
william
burnham
yes,
the--
mr.
william
burnham
--yes,
that
would
be
one
distinction.
we
would
argue
that
it
should
make
no
difference
because
in
fact
that
injunction
had
been
totally
moot
for
some
four
years.
mr.
william
burnham
well,
that
is
an
important
point.
i
believe
it
is
important
to
emphasize
that
a
declaratory
judgment
does
not
establish
any
state
liability
for
payment
of
anything.
it
simply
establishes
that
the
state
through
its
regulation
violated
federal
law
in
the
past,
but
the
consequences
are
of
that
determination--
mr.
william
burnham
--yes,
that's
true,
and
that
would
be
the
situation
on
the
quern
case
as
well.
mr.
william
burnham
it
would
be
petitioners'
position
that
the
same
description
of
the
effect
of
notice
relief
applied
in
quern
would
apply
in
this
case,
and
that
would
be
that
the
chain
of
causation
is
clearly
severed,
and
that
it
is
in
fact
up
to
the
state
as
to
whether
or
not...
what
they
do
with
this
substantive
federal
question
determination,
that
they
may
in
fact
not
have
to
pay
any
benefits.
mr.
william
burnham
i
am
not
entirely
clear
about
the
declaratory
relief.
i
believe
what
they
said
was,
the
notice
of
relief
was
barred.
mr.
william
burnham
and
that
to
the
extent
that
we
sought
declaratory
relief,
i
think
the
clear
implication
of
that
is
that
declaratory
relief
is
barred.
i
don't
think
that
they--
mr.
william
burnham
--in
essence
that
would
be
the
only
place
that
the
plaintiffs
could
go.
that
is
correct.
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
plaintiffs
believe
that
the
district
court,
that
the
sixth
circuit
decision
is
completely
contrary
to
the
rule
of
ex
parte
young
and
the
rule
of
edelman
versus
jordan.
ex
parte
young
in
essence
held
that
a
suit
against
a
state
officer
is
in
fact
not
a
suit
against
a
state,
but
ford
motor
company
and
edelman,
of
course,
make
it
clear
that
it
in
fact
monetary
relief
is
sought,
then
that
pierces
the
fiction
of
ex
parte
young,
and
it
again
may
become
a
suit
against
the
state.
under
the
circumstances
here,
the
court
in
quern
has
quite
clearly
held
that
notice
relief,
this
kind
of
relief,
is
not
a
money
judgment,
and
consequently
the
ford
motor
company
exception
does
not
apply
to
that.
consequently,
it
should
be
treated
no
differently
than
any
other
kind
of
injunctive
relief,
and
after
all,
it
is
an
injunction.
it
is
an
order
to
the
state
that
they
in
fact
provide
certain
kinds
of
notices
to
the
plaintiff
class
members.
and
under
the
circumstances,
it
should
not
be
deemed
to
violate
the
eleventh
amendment.
indeed,
the
ex
parte
young
court
mentions
the
situation
of
habeas
corpus
relief,
which
is
a
situation
where
obviously
there
is
a
determination
that
in
the
past
the
state
officials
violated
the
federal
rights
of
the
plaintiff.
however,
the
court
indicated
that
that
was
not
a
violation
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
that
is
a
clear
indication
to
petitioners
that
ex
parte
young
was
not
as
narrow
as
the
sixth
circuit
would
say
it
was.
in
other
words,
it
did
not
just
provide
for
prospective
injunction
against
ongoing
violations.
in
fact,
it
contemplated
explicitly
a
determination
of
past
misconduct,
and
of
course
that
in
modern
eleventh
amendment
parlance,
the
habeas
corpus
writ
would
not
violate
the
eleventh
amendment
simply
because
there
was
no
impact
on
the
state
treasury
in
that
situation.
that
is
like
the
expunction
case.
that
is
like
the
public
employee
record
expunction
situation.
it
is
non-monetary
relief,
albeit
based
upon
a
past
determination
of
misconduct,
and
that
is
permitted
by
the
eleventh
amendment.
the
final
point
i
would
like
to
mention
is
that
the
reading
of
the
sixth
circuit
in
this
case
of
ex
parte
young
gives
the
state
a
virtually
limitless
power
to
control
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court.
there
was
a
great
deal
of
delay
in
these
cases,
and
of
course
the
federal
court
dockets
are
very
crowded.
the
state
can
quite
easily
have
an
incentive
to
look
to
delay
because
they
can
simply
avoid
any
determination
of
past
misconduct
by
at
the
eleventh
hour
complying
with
future...
with
ongoing
federal
law.
if
they
do
that,
then
they
wipe
out
any
past
claim
for
the
back
benefits.
that
sort
of
control
over
the
court's
jurisdiction
quite
clearly
should
not
be
allowed.
the
facts
of
this
case,
in
fact
the
stepparent
violation
that
we
believe
is...
the
state
is
engaged
in
right
now,
quite
clearly
the
state
could
render
that
issue
quite
moot
by
saying,
okay,
we
know
the
stakes
are
high
in
this
case
because
an
order
could
be
ancillary
to
that
ongoing
injunction.
consequently,
we
will
decide
that
we
will
comply.
that
would
then
divest
the
district
court
of
jurisdiction,
and
under
the
ancillary
theory
of
quern
there
would
be
no
basis
for
ordering
a
notice
relief
remedy.
that
sort
of
power
should
not
be
allowed,
and
it
doesn't
make
any
sense,
simply
because
the
issue
of
future
violations
and
the
issue
of
past
violations
are
two
rather
distinct
things.
thank
you.
mr.
william
burnham
i
would
like
to
just
briefly
respond
to
something
that
mr.
caruso
said
about
the
availability
of
hearings.
in
fact,
as
indicated
in
our
reply
brief
in
the
stepparent
case,
for
those
persons
who
asked
for
hearings,
they
were
denied
hearings.
they
were
told
that
because
it
was
an
automatic
change
in
grants
and
so
on,
they
could
not
get
an
administrative
hearing.
now,
later
they
changed
that
policy
when
they
found
that
that
was
also
a
violation
of
federal
law.
however,
at
the
time
that
the
suit
was
filed,
it
was
quite
clear
that
the
plaintiffs
were
unable
to
get
any
relief
by
way
of
the
state
administrative
tribunal,
which
is,
of
course,
one
of
the
reasons
why
they
filed
in
federal
court.
