justice
byron
r.
white
you
want
the
notice.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
want
the
notice
so
that
these
people
could
apply
for
relief
in
state
courts.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
to
get...
to
get
what
you
think
they
are
entitled
to
prior
to
the
amendment
of
the
federal
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
was
a
declaratory
judgment
proper?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
only
purpose
of
it
would
be
to
effect...
to
declare
whether
the
federal
law
had
been
violated
in
the
past.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
only
purpose
of
it
would
be
to
give
somebody
a
basis
for
making
a
claim
in
state
administrative
proceedings.
justice
byron
r.
white
certainly
you
wouldn't
say
that
notice
would
have
been
properly
ordered
except
for
a
declaratory
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
--that
there
is--
justice
byron
r.
white
--i
know,
but
the
injunction
is
moot,
in
this
case.
i
mean,
wasn't
the
law
changed?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
have
to
say
you
are
entitled
to
a
declaratory
judgment
about
whether
the
state
had
been
violating
the
federal
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
is
that
prospective?
that
seems
to
me
that
is--
--looking
back.
--looking
backward.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
on
the
basis...
that
would
be
the
same
if
you
ordered
money
be
paid.
it
is
always
pain
in
the
future.
and
the
eleventh
amendment
wouldn't--
justice
byron
r.
white
--what
are
you
saying?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
could
say
the
same
thing
about
money.
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
could
be,
but
it
would
still--
--edelman
against
jordan
rejected
that
as
to
money.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
whether
the
court
was
right
or
wrong
in
quern,
it
said
that
it
was
ancillary
to
prospective
relief,
didn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
stop
right
there.
what
is
the
prospective
relief
again
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
hard
to
swallow
that.
really,
it
is
cutting
it
awfully
thin.
just
quite
apart
from
mootness,
is
that,
giving
prudential
consideration
in
some
way,
is
that
a
sound
use
of
declaratory
judgments,
to
render
a
totally
abstract
decision
on
something
where
the
federal
court
cannot
give
injunctive
relief
because
it
is
not
applicable?
it
can't
give
damage
because
of
the
eleventh
amendment,
but
nonetheless
adjudicate
the
merits
in
a
declaratory
judgment,
and
then
take
that
into
state
court
where
you
are
going
to
plead
it
is
res
judicata
on
liability?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
know,
there
are
some
federal
statutes
that
restrict
the
power
of
the
federal
courts
to
issue
injunctions.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
although
the
statutes
don't
say
so,
the
courts
have
said
the
same
rule
applies
to
declaratory
judgments.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
am
not
talking
about
those.
there
are
statute,
for
example,
that
keep
the
federal
courts
from
enjoining
the
collection
of
taxes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
those
have
been
interpreted
to
apply
to
declaratory
judgments,
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
and
that
is
the
argument
here.
when
you
enter
a
declaratory
judgment,
you
have
tied
the
state's
hands.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
the
statute
hadn't
been
amended
at
all.
then
the
court
could
probably
have
said,
determined
what
the
federal
statute
required,
and
if
the
statute
was
being
violated,
it
could
have
entered
an
injunction.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
eleventh
amendment
would
permit
prospective
relief.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
i
suppose...
i
would
suppose
the
same
objection
could
be
raised
in
those
circumstances
to
giving
them
notice
that
they
are
being
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
because...
on
the
grounds
that
it
is
really
ancillary
to
retrospective
relief.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
past.
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
the
district
court
in
an
injunction
action
enter
his
conclusions
of
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
proper
basis
for
an
injunction
is
that
there
is
a
violation
of
law
that
has
been
going
on.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
conclude
that
there
is...
that
this
is
what
the
statute
means,
this
is
what
the
state
is
not
doing,
and
therefore
you
need
an
injunction.
now,
that
is
for
all
intents
and
purposes
a
declaratory
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
is
it?
what
is
it?
it
is
a
declaration--
justice
byron
r.
white
--that
the
state
is
violating
the
law,
and
therefore
it
is
an
injunction.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
justice
stevens'
example,
suppose
six
months
before
this
law
was
changed--
justice
byron
r.
white
--there
was
an
injunction,
there
was
an
injunction
entered
based
on
a
declaration
or
a
conclusion
that
the
law
was
being
violated.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
exactly
true
of
the
stepparent
case
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
was
a
preliminary
injunction
entered.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
injunction
was
on
appeal.
wasn't
the
state
supposed
to
have
made
that
injunction?
justice
byron
r.
white
wasn't
it
supposed
to...
wasn't
it
supposed
to
obey
the
preliminary
injunction,
or
was
it--
justice
byron
r.
white
--i
see,
so
they
made
the
payments.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
wasn't
any
need
for
a
notice
for
that
period.
justice
byron
r.
white
okay,
that
is
all
i
wanted.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
can't
be
ongoing
if
they
are
going
to
evade
the
injunction,
and
as
soon
as
the
injunction
entered,
whatever
the
violation
was--
justice
byron
r.
white
--it
stops.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
what
would
the
possible
purpose
of
a
notice
in
that
situation
be
except
to
be
of
an
aid
to
past
violations?
