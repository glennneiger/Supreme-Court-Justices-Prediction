what
remains
of
that
first
case
now,
the
one
that
you
have
just
described,
after
the
chance?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
are
you
seeking
damages
for
the
period
before
1981?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
isn't
the
case
moot
or
very
close
to
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
takes
more
than
just
a
very
tiny
thing
to
keep
a
case
alive.
for
instance,
an
award
of
costs,
the
outstanding
issue
of
costs
won't
keep
a
case
from
being
moot.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
strikes
me
that
this
is
really
awfully
far
down
the
line
so
far
as
any
live
controversy
about
federal
issues
is
concerned.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
were
no
damage
claims
in
quern?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
are
dealing
with
something
that
is
just
almost
identical.
why
shouldn't
it
be
rejected
for
the
same
reason?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that
doesn't
really
answer
my
question.
i
asked
you
if
you
thought
it
was
a
sound
use
of
declaratory
judgments
to
use
it
in
that
manner.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
state
would
have
to
defend
the
action
in
state
courts.
you
know,
maybe
the
state
courts
would
come
to
precisely
the
same
conclusion.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
determination
of
illegality
in
quern
was
originally
made
in
the
context
of
the
edelman
pleas,
where
the
court
determined
illegality
and
awarded
damages,
thinking
that
it
could
do
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
determination
of
illegality
served
a
purpose
in
the
federal
court.
that
is,
it
was
the
basis
for
awarding
damages,
albeit
later
held
to
be
improperly
awarded,
but
your
determination
here
by
declaratory
judgment
doesn't
serve
any
purpose
other
than
to
take
it
into
another
court
system
and
say,
look,
it
is
res
judicata.
