paul
stevens
maybe
this
has
already
been
covered,
but
did
the
court
of
appeals
hold
that
both
the
notice
relief
and
the
request
for
a
declaratory
judgment
were
barred
by
the
eleventh
amendment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
their
position
was
that
i
guess
the
declaratory
judgment
went
to
a
question
of
federal
law.
in
effect
they
were
saying
the
eleventh
amendment
requires
that
that
question
of
federal
law
must
be
decided
by
a
state
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
question,
mr.
caruso?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
is
somewhat
unusual
because
of
the
change
in
the
law
on
october
1st,
1981,
as
i
remember
the
facts.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
there
had
been
a
judgment
entered
by
the
district
court,
say,
on
september
15th,
1981,
pursuant
to
a
complaint
which
asked
for
injunctive
relief
and
declaratory
judgment,
would
you
say
that
at
that
time
the
court
could
have
entered
a
declaratory
judgment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
the
judge--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--supposing
the
judge...
you
don't
think
the
finding
as
to
past
violations...
say
there
was
no
change
in
the
law
at
all.
could
he
not
then
have
entered
a
declaratory
judgment
saying
you
violated
in
the
past,
and
i
want
the
parties
to
argue
about
the
kind
of
injunctive
relief
what
was
appropriate,
and
one
of
the
things
i
will
take
into
consideration
is
the
nature
of
the
past
violations?
justice
john
paul
stevens
my
question
is
whether...
if
at
the
time
the
declaratory
judgment
is
entered
it
is
then
legally
permissible
to
enter
an
injunction,
why
isn't
the
declaratory
judgment
also
legally
permissible
at
that
time,
just
as
a
predicate
for
the
rest
of
the
litigation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
pursue
my
other
question
just--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--because
i
am
not
quite
sure
i
follow
everything
you
are
saying.
supposing
again
in
my
hypothetical
example
you
have
a
declaratory
judgment
and
an
injunction
entered,
which
you
agree
would
not
be
barred
by
the
eleventh
amendment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
30
days
later
congress
passed
the
new
statute
that
says
you
don't
have
to
follow
this
procedure
any
more,
and
so
the
state
goes
in
or
its
officials
go
in
and
say
we
want
the
injunction
vacated
because
the
law
has
been
changed.
you
vacate
the
injunction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
the
eleventh
amendment
require
that
the
declaratory
judgment
also
be
vacated,
in
your
view?
and
if
so,
why?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
had
been
violating
federal
law
for
the
past
two
years.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
wouldn't
be
ineffectual
as
it
might
happen
here.
the
members
of
the
class
thereafter
go
into
michigan
administrative
proceedings
and
say
we
would
like
to
get
out
past
benefits
or
whatever
it
is
based
on
that
finding
of
illegality,
and
the
state
would
have
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
pay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
the
ongoing
violation--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--is
the
ongoing
violation
essential?
sometimes
we
get
cases
where
a
governmental
agency
has
voluntarily
changed
its
policies
pending
adjudication,
supposing
before
the
time
of
the
judgment
they
voluntarily
changed
their
policies
and
then
later
on
there
was
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
an
adjudication
of
liability,
adjudication
of
ongoing
violation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
caruso,
it
is
true
that
your
position
is
that
whatever
federal
question
of
law
has
to
be
decided
ought
to
be
decided
by
the
state
court.
