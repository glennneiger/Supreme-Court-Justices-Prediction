justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
burnham,
as
i
understand
it,
you
make
no
claim
for
prospective
relief.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
identify
what
you
claim
as
possibly
being
prospective
if
the
court
below
thought
you
had
advanced
any
claim
for
prospective
relief.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
no
claim
for
damages.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
i
understand
you
want
notice
relief,
but
what
would
that
relief
lead
to?
would
it
lead
to
a
damage
claim
against
the
state
for
alleged
violation
of
law
prior
to
1981?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
quern,
my
recollection
is
that
the
notice
relief
was
ancillary
to
some
prospective
relief.
if
that
is
correct,
do
you
have
an
analogy
here?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
