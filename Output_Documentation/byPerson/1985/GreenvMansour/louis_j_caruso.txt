mr.
louis
j.
caruso
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
this
case
that
is
on
review
was
compelled
by
law
principles
that
were
previously
established
by
decisions
of
this
court,
and
the
purpose
of
the
eleventh
amendment
requires
adherence
to
those
principles.
in
this
case,
the
petitioners
could
have
availed
themselves
of
a
state
forum.
instead,
they
chose
the
federal
forum
to
deal
with
two
cases
in
which
the
judicial
power
was
constitutionally
limited,
and
now
are
strenuously
attempting
to
override
that
limitations.
they
contend
that
they
are
not
after
money
relief
by
way
of
a
judgment.
a
declaratory
ruling
of
past
actions
coupled
with
a
notice
as
an
invitation
to
class
members
to
seek
state
administrative
relief
as
to
those
past
actions
as
requested
here,
i
suggest,
is
designed
to
obtain
retroactive
payment
of
an
accrued
monetary
liability
through
the
force
of
a
federal
judicial
power
in
contravention
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
and
it
certainly
becomes
quite
evident
that
that
would
be
the
case
when
you
consider
the
nature
of
a
declaratory
judgment.
a
declaratory
judgment
under
the
act
is
a
final
judgment,
and
it
adjudicates
the
rights
of
the
parties
involved,
and
it
is
an
actual
case
in
controversy,
and
it
would
cover
a
period
here
when
the
respondent
was
not
under
a
final
court
imposed
obligation
to
comport
her
conduct
with
different
standards.
now,
this
becomes
quite
evident
when
you
consider
the
ancillary
notices
that
were
considered
in
quern
and
in
edelman
and
in
trainor
v.
jordan.
the
first
notice
was
rejected
by
the
court.
after
rejecting
the
first
notice,
they
approved
a
notice
that
merely
advised
the
class
that
the
court
described
as
one
that
simply
informed
the
class
that
the
federal
suit
is
at
an
and
and
the
federal
court
can
provide
no
further
relief,
and
if
they
may
wish
to
pursue
state
administrative
remedies,
they
may
do
this.
but
this
kind
of
notice,
the
court
said,
didn't
impose
any
retroactive
liability.
it
was
in
no
way
handicapped
by
a
federal
court
determination
of
state
liability,
and
in
that
case,
in
the
case,
in
the
quern
case,
there
was
an
adjudication
by
the
court
of
misconduct,
and
there
was
a
prospective
compliance
order
entered
in
that
court,
and
we
don't
have
that
situation
here.
the
court,
however,
found
the
first
notice
offered
in
quern
to
be
infirm.
it
expressed
a
finding
of
past
liability.
that
notice
stated,
you
are
denied
public
assistance
to
which
you
were
entitled.
respondent
submits
that
if
the
court
were
to
allow
that
kind
of
notice
that
was
found
acceptable
by
the
court
in
quern
to
be
coupled,
predicated
on
a
declaratory
judgment
of
past
actions
as
requested
by
petitioners,
the
quern
notice
would
be
changed
in
its
import
because
it
would
become
indistinguishable
from
a
substantive
federal
question
determination
by
a
federal
court
of
past
action.
it
would
import
the
same
degree
of
finality
that
the
first
notice
that
was
proposed
in
quern
that
was
found
to
be,
that
was
found
by
the
court
to
be
infirm.
it
would
permit,
as
the
court
said
in
colbeth,
to
do
indirectly
what
is
prohibited
to
be
done
directly.
insofar
as
ex
parte
young
is
concerned,
ex
parte
young
was
cast
by
the
court
as
an
exception,
as
a
necessary
exception
to
vindicate
federal
rights.
and
the
relief
in
that
case
was
a
prospective
compliance
order
against
a
state
official
to
comport,
to
have
that
official
comport
his
conduct
with
the
constitution
and
not
enforce
a
statute
that
was
held
to
be
unconstitutional.
at
no
time
has
ex
parte
young
or
the
subsequent
cases
applied
by
this
court
dealing
with
the
exception
encompassed
declaratory
judgments
of
past
actions
in
the
notice
relief
requested
here.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
yes.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
that's
right.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
no,
the
court
could
not
have
entered
a
declaratory
judgment
unless
a
declaratory
judgment
was
related
to
the
prospective...
the
ongoing
violation.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
i
did
not
ask
for
past
violations.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
it
may
take
into
consideration
the
nature
of
the
past
violations
only
for
the
purposes
of
stopping
the
ongoing
violation
insofar
as
the
exception
to
the
eleventh
amendment
is
concerned,
because
the
eleventh
amendment
is
concerned,
because
the
eleventh
amendment
prohibits
equitable
and
legal
relief
in
state
courts
against
the
state.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
because
a
declaratory
judgment
is
not
a
prospective
compliance
order.
that
is
the
only
exception
that
is
permitted.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
yes.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
that
is
correct.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
it
is
not
a
declaratory
judgment.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
well,
it
requires...
it
requires--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--if
that
is
a
declaration
of
the
violation
of
the
law
that
is
occurring
at
that
time,
it
would
not
be
prohibited
by
the
eleventh
amendment.
based
upon
that
declaration
of
violation
an
injunction
could
be
entered
under
the
eleventh...
and
not
violate
the
eleventh
amendment
as
to
prospective
compliance.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
yes.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
then
a
proper
quern
notice
could
be
entered
as
predicated
on
that
injunction--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--that
is
based
upon
the
declaratory
judgment
that
was
entered.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
and
that
injunction
that
would
be
entered--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--no.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
there
was
a
preliminary
injunction,
but
a
preliminary
injunction--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--that
preliminary
injunction
was
against
the
state,
but
it
was
a
preliminary
injunction.
it
was
never
filed--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--and
it
did
obey
the
preliminary
injunction.
it
did
comply
in
every
respect,
and
it
did
make
the
payments.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
that's
right.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
there
wasn't
any
need
to
have
any
notice.
there
isn't
any
need
at
this
time
because
not
only
did
they
pay
with
respect
to
the
claim--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--but...
that's
right.
now,
one
of
the
things
you
may
have
as
a
prospective
injunctive
order
could
be
based,
justice
stevens,
upon
a
declaratory
judgment
of
ongoing
violation.
perhaps
i
misunderstood,
and
orders
ancillary
to
such
injunctive
relief
have
been
permitted
by
the
court
as
necessary
to
accomplish
termination
of
this
conduct,
because
the
essence
of
the
ex
parte
young
exception
is
termination
of
unconstitutional
conduct
by
state
officers
by
a
prospective
injunctive
order
absent
congressional
abrogation
or
a
state
waiver
of
that
immunity.
now,
the
orders
ancillary
to
injunctive
relief
have
been
permitted
by
the
court,
and
an
example
of
that
is
milliken
v.
bradley,
which
required
the
taking
of
affirmative
steps
that
resulted
in
expenditures
of
money
out
of
state
treasury,
but
that
relief,
however,
so
far
as
the
ancillary
order
is
concerned,
was
prospective
and
primarily
directed
toward
cessation
of
the
violation
of
the
federal
law.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
milliken
v.
bradley,
the
court
made
it
very
clear
that
that
is
all
they
could
do,
is
to
award
prospective
relief,
prospective
compliance
order.
i
wish
to
make
it
clear
here--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--pardon
me.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
yes.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
yes.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
i
don't
believe
it
would
require
the
declaratory
judgment
to
be
vacated
if
the
law
was
changed
because
there
was
a
determination
at
that
time
that
the
state
was
in
violation
of
federal
law
by
virtue
of
the
declaratory
judgment
and
an
injunction
put
in
place.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
so
then
after
that
the
law
had
changed.
i
wouldn't
say
it
would
be
necessary
to
vacate.
it
would
be
ineffectual.
it
wouldn't--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--if
there
was
an
ongoing
violation
and
a
determination
of
that
ongoing
violation
by
a
declaratory
judgment
upon
which
there
was
based
an
injunction,
and
notice
on
that
injunction
to
the
class
concerning
the
violation,
i
would
say
that
they
could
do
that
in
the
state
administrative
procedure.
that
would
be
all
right.
but
in
the
hypothetical
that
you
pose
there
would
have
been
a
determination
of
liability
of
an
ongoing
violation.
in
this
case
there
is
no
such
thing
as
an
ongoing
violation.
there
is
nothing
to
enjoin.
there
is
nothing
to
determine
except--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--except
by
going
in
the
past
and
making
a
declaratory
judgment
as
to
past
actions.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
in
that
hypothet
there
would
be
no
determination
by
a
court
as
to
ongoing
violation,
and
that
is
necessary.
there
must
be
an
adjudication
by
a
federal
court.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
an
ongoing...
an
adjudication
of
liability
concerning
their
present
acts
and
the
relief
would
be
to
stop
that
ongoing
violation,
in
other
words,
to
put
a
termination
to
that--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--that
ends
it.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
that
ends
it.
that
stops.
that's
right.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
i
think
that
that
is
the
way
you
have
to
read
the
quern
notice.
the
quern
notice,
i
think,
probably
would
have
to
be
the
past
violation,
but
nevertheless
insofar
as
we...
as
the
courts
have
gone
today,
it
has
to
be
based
upon
a
prospective
compliance
order
and
not
a
judgment
as
to
past
action,
because
an
injunction,
a
determination
by
injunctive
order
doesn't
adjudicate
the
actions
that
have
taken
place
heretofore
as
a
declaratory
judgment
to
past
actions
would
necessarily
do.
at
any
rate,
as
i
say,
i
wish
to
make
it
clear
that
the
respondent
does
not
seek
any
decision
here
that
would
permit
the
avoidance
of
the
state's
responsibility
with
respect
to
the
state's
federal
aided
programs,
public
welfare
programs,
because
they
do
have
the
administrative
procedures
in
place
or
mandated
by
congress,
and
also
there
is
available
the
judicial
forum
in
the
state
and
they
could...
that
could
review
any
decisions
made
at
the
administrative
level,
and
they
could
take
judicial
action.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
not
every
federal
question
of
law,
but
in
this
situation,
the
type
of
relief
that
they
are
seeking
here
should
be
decided
in
state
court
because
the
type
of
relief
that
is
available
to
them
because
of
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity
is
only
a
prospective
injunction,
and
a
prospective
injunction
is
not
available
here
simply
because
there
is
no
violation
of
federal
law,
and
there
has
never
been
a
determination
made
by
a
federal
court
that
there
was
at
any
time
a
violation
of
federal
law.
