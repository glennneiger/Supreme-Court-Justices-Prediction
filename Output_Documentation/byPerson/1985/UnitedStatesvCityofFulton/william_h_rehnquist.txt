mr.
pincus,
what
exactly
do
you
mean
by
the
term
ferc?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
it
took
33
months
between
the
time
of
the
promulgation
of
the
tentative
rate
or
the
interim,
and
the
final
approval?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
doubt
about
the
ferc's
authority
to
raise
as
well
as
to
lower
the
proposed
rate?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
rather
extraordinary,
though,
isn't
it,
mr.
wheatley,
for
a
utility,
public
or
private,
not
to
have
any
ability
to
set
new
rates
in
force
short
of
a
33
month
delay.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
an
interim
rate
isn't
so
important
unless
you've
go
a
period
of
heavy
inflation.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
all
i'm
suggesting--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--is,
you
know,
this
doesn't
affect
the
argument
based
on
the
language
of
the
contract
or
the
language
of
the
statute,
but
when
you
are
arguing
past
practice,
it
may
be
that
the
regulators
saw
a
need
for
an
interim
rate
only
in
a
time
of
heavy
inflation.
