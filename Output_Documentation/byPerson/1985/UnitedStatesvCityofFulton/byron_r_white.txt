justice
byron
r.
white
well
of
course,
if
you
are
right
on
your
interpretation
of
the
energy
act,
in
that
the
secretary
has...
in
that
you
claim
the
act
gives
the
secretary
complete
ratemaking
power.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he's
created
his
own
problem
by
giving
final
approval
to
the
ferc.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
is,
it
is
if,
it
is
if
you
say
that,
if
there's
a
long
delay.
the
secretary
doesn't
need
to
delay
anything.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
here
the
ferc
raised
the
rates,
didn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
ferc's
in
the
act
at
all,
you
claim,
just
by
the
will
of
the
secretary.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
certainly
true,
but
your
question
is
whether,
whether
you
needed
a
final
order
before
any
rates
could
go
into
effect.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
ferc
inherited
power
to
approve
rates
directly
from
the
fpc?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
that
ferc
derives
its
power
from
a
delegation
of
the
secretary.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
secretary
would
have
had
the...
could
have
kept
the
entire
power
himself.
justice
byron
r.
white
with
the
secretary
proposing
them.
