mr.
charles
f.
wheatley,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
view
of
the
argument
that
the
government
has
made,
we
think
there
are
three
main
issues
that
are
before
this
court
relating
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
department
of
energy
could
impose
an
interim
rate
structure
on
the
rates.
the
first
question
is
whether
or
not
the
contacts
the
government
entered
with
these
three
cities,
by
their
terms,
do
not
allow
an
interim
rate
but
require
the
final
rate,
approved
by
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission.
mr.
charles
f.
wheatley,
jr.
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
wheatley,
jr.
justice
o'connor,
i
believe
that
the
contracts
have
independent
validity
because
when
you
read
the
language
of
those
contracts,
they
are
more
explicit
and
more
definitive
than
in
fact
the
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
charles
f.
wheatley,
jr.
well,
the
language
of
the--
mr.
charles
f.
wheatley,
jr.
--well,
i
don't
see
how
the
language
of
the
contract
could
reach
a
retroactive
result
because
it
says
the
new
rates
shall
thereupon
become
effective
in
accordance
with
and
on
the
effective--
mr.
charles
f.
wheatley,
jr.
--date
specified
in
the
order.
now,
it
says
"thereupon".
in
other
words,
the
ferc
and
its
predecessor
the
federal
power
commission,
would
have
to
confirm
and
approve
the
increase,
and
they
cannot
approve
the
increase
and
confirm
it
until
they
do
that
in
a
final
order.
now,
the
words
fpc,
that
refers
to
the
final
approval
process,
so
that
you
need...
the
commission
would
have
to
be
making
its
final
approval.
a
case
directly
in
point
on
that
is
new
york
state
electric
&
gas
v.
ferc
at
712
f.
2d
762
or
768.
the
frc...
neither
the
fpc
nor
the
ferc
nor
anyone
involved
in
these
rates
since
they
have
been
in
effect
have
ever
sought
to
put
them
into
effect
on
a
retroactive
basis,
and
i
think
it
comes
from
the
language
in
the
contract
and
also
from
the
language
of
the
flood
control
act
which
says
that
the
rate
increases
cannot
be
put
into
effect
until
a
confirmation
and
approval,
which
by
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
means
final
approval.
so
the
commission
could
not
after
final
approval
attempt
to
backdate
the
contract.
that
issue
hasn't
come
up,
but
the
language
certainly
is
clear
regardless
of
the
question
of
retroactivity,
that
the
language
of
the
contract
is
more
explicit
and
more
detailed
than
the
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
charles
f.
wheatley,
jr.
we
say
that,
first,
if
you
read
the
contracts,
the
plain
language
of
the
contracts
and
the
consistent
practice
under
those
contracts,
and
up
to
this
case
as
well
as
the
interpretation
of
the
words
in
the
contract
by
other
courts
and
by
the
federal
power
commission,
those
kinds
of
words
in
the
whole
group
of
sierra-mobile
cases,
if
you
take
that
whole--
mr.
charles
f.
wheatley,
jr.
--if
you
put...
no,
clearly
not.
if
you
put
aside
the
clear
language
of
the
contracts
which
go
beyond
the
language
of
the
statutory
in
being
explicit
that
you
need
a
final
order
and
that
interim
rates
are
not
permitted,
you
still
have
the
language
of
the
flood
control
act
which,
as
it
was
construed
in
the
legislative
history,
required
a
final
order
by
the
fpc,
and
under
the
administrative
practice,
consistent
administrative
practice
under
the
flood
control
act
up
until
this
case,
that
act
was
consistently
construed
as
requiring
the
final
approval
by
the
federal
power
commission,
and
even
as
we
read...
every
court
that
considered
this,
it
was
three
district
courts
and
the
court
of
claims,
the
federal
circuit
court
and
the
fifth
circuit,
all
six
of
those
courts,
to
our
opinion,
in
construing
section
5
of
the
flood
control
act,
have
construed
that
that
act
required
a
final
decision
by
the
federal
power
commission
or
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission.
the
fifth
circuit
opinion--
mr.
charles
f.
wheatley,
jr.
--that's
correct.
that's
what
we
think
the
section
5
of
the
flood
control
act,
justice
white,
requires,
and
the
fifth
circuit
in
its
construction
of
section
5
of
the
flood
control
act,
if
you
read
the
opinion
closely,
seemed
to
reach
the
same
conclusion.
they
got
a
different
result,
not
under
section
5
of
the
flood
control
act
but
saying
the
department
of
energy
act
modified
and
amended
section
5
of
the
flood
control
act.
so
it
is
the
fifth
circuit
which
alone
of
all
the
courts
that
considered
this,
have
said
interim
rates
are
possible,
has
reached
that
result
on
the
basis
of
the
decision
of
congress
in
their
minds
in
the
doe
act,
but
when
you
track
through
the
exact
provisions
of
the
doe
act,
an
it
was
only
a
transfer,
the
legislative
history
was
quite
clear
that
it
was
not
to
be
an
amendment
of
the
prior
laws,
the
prior
statutes,
and
each
of
the
exact
provisions
of
the
doe
act,
we
think
that
the
federal
circuit
reached
a
better
opinion.
mr.
charles
f.
wheatley,
jr.
no.
i
think
what
happened
was
that--
mr.
charles
f.
wheatley,
jr.
--i
think
it
does
arise
from
a
delegation.
mr.
charles
f.
wheatley,
jr.
he
could
have
kept
that
power,
but
he
could
have
kept
only
the
power
that
was
granted
by
section
5
of
the
flood
control
act,
and
that
power
was
limited
by
congress.
when
you
read
the
legislative
history
of
section
5,
they
did
not
intend
to
give
plenary
authority
to
the
federal
power
commission
in
the
approval
of
rates.
it
was
a
very
limited
authority.
it
could
only
be
directed
to
approve
or
confirm
the
rates.
so--
mr.
charles
f.
wheatley,
jr.
--yes,
what
they
propose.
it
could
either
act...
veto
it...
just,
mr.
ickes
in
his
appearance
before
the
committee
when
the
section
5
was
being
debated
in
its
predecessor
act,
the
bonneville
act,
said
quite
expressly
that
it
was
a
veto
power.
it
required
final
action
by
the
federal
power
commission,
but
it
was
a
limited
authority
to
affirm.
it
was
not
a
plenary
grant
of
authority
like
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
or
like
the
federal
power
commission
has
under
their
express
statutes.
now,
had
congress
in
1944
in
passing
section
5
of
the
flood
control
act
intended
to
grant
the
power
to
either
the
secretary
or
to
the
federal
power
commission
to
grant
interim
rates,
it
could
have
used
the
language
that
it
had
before
it
in
the
earlier
natural
gas
act
of
1938
or
the
federal
power
act
of
1935,
also
the
interstate
commerce
act
had
express
provisions
in
it
that
allow
for
interim
rates
and
authorize
interim
rates.
section
5
of
the
flood
control
act
did
not
intend
to
do
that,
and
i
think
the
reasons
for
it
are
set
forth
in
the
analysis
that
the
fifth
circuit
made
of
section
5
wherein
i
think
the
fifth
circuit
came
up
with
the
conclusion
that
there
wasn't
any
authority
in
the
flood
control
act
of
1944
to
permit
interim
rates.
mr.
charles
f.
wheatley,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
the
delay,
mr.
rehnquist,
was
a
result
of
procedures
which
the
secretary
of
energy
and
the
<ferc>
[=
ferc],
he
could
have
increased,
shortened
that
time
considerably,
and
they
have
shortened
it
since
that
time.
furthermore,
in
the
long
history
after
the
flood
control
act
was
enacted,
in
'44,
in
all
of
the
dealings
with
the
cities
under
the
swpa,
over
that
entire
period
of
time
up
to
the
instance
in
this
case,
at
no
time
did
swpa
ever
sought
to
issue
an
interim
rate.
that's
up
to
'79.
after
the
court
of
claims
decision
in
this
case
in
'82,
swpa
went
back
to
its
old
practice
of
not
issuing
interim
rates,
and
in
1983
they
issued
a
rate
that
was
not
an
interim
rate,
and
if
the
court
can
take
judicial
notice
of
swpa's
annual
report
for
1984,
they
have
done
very
well
indeed
since
they've
been
following
the
practice.
the
report
states...
this
is
the
annual
report
for
'84...
i'm
pleased
to
report
the
southwestern
power
administration
was
financially
healthy
when
the
books
were
closed
at
the
end
of
fiscal
1984.
we
received
record
revenues
of
$100.5
million,
of
which
$93.2
million
was
deposited
with
the
u.s.
treasury,
assisting
in
reduction
of
the
federal
deficit.
this
may
be
compared
to
the
$52
million
in
funds
appropriated
by
congress
for
operation
of
the
southwestern
power
system.
of
this
revenue,
$21.8
million
was
available
for
debt
retirement,
which
also,
is
also
a
record.
our
previous
accumulated
debt
retirement
was
$39.9
million.
these
records
were
achieved
in
a
year
of
slightly
less
than
average
electric
energy
generation.
so
i
think
this
report
which
was
based
on
rates
that
were
issued
without
violating
the
express
language
of
the
contracts
of
the
cities,
shows
that
swpa
through
the
department
of
energy
and
utilizing
a
procedure
without
interim
rates,
can
operate
to
keep
its
books
in
balance
and
to
do
well.
now,
the
question
of
the
contract
itself,
this
case
is
one
of
the
first
cases
to
reach
this
court
from
the
new
federal
circuit,
and
congress
has
set
up
that
court
to
have
expertise
in
matters
such
as
this
dealing
with
the
meaning
of
federal
contracts.
we
have
the
result
of
both
the
court
of
claims
before
it
was
abolished
and
the
federal
circuit
court
of
appeals
construing
the
language
of
the
contract
in
this
case
as
on
its
claimed
language
precluding
a
rate
increase
to
these
cities
until
such
time
as
there
have
been
a
final
confirmation
and
approval
by
the
ferc.
now,
that
contract
construction
where
the
court
subsequently
went
into
the
course
of
conduct
between
the
parties
over
the
long
period
of
time
that
the
contracts
had
been
in
effect
i
think
is
entitled
to
great
deference.
the
findings
that
both
the
court
of
claims
and
the
federal
circuit
reached
on
the
meaning
of
these
contracts
and
the
plain
language
and
the
course
of
conduct
is
within
their
scope
of
expertise
to
review
and
consider
federal
contracts.
the
fifth
circuit
in
its
opinion
really
didn't
analyze
the
contracts.
it
really
simply
analyzed
the
statutory,
and
just
assumed
that
the
contracts
would
follow
its
construction
of
the
subsequent
statutes.
we
think
that
the
fifth
circuit
was
in
error.
there
was
a
long
pattern
of
conduct
that
started
after
the
flood
control
act
was
issued,
where
no
interim
rates
were
issued
by
swpa.
we
have
listed
the
cases
at
pages
36
and
37
from
1947
on
up
to
the
'70s.
throughout
all
of
those
cases
until
the
present
case,
swpa
never
sought
an
interim
rate.
mr.
charles
f.
wheatley,
jr.
well,
the
interim
rate
is
i
think
a
question
of
what...
it
could
be
important
in
an
inflationary
period,
yes,
but
on
the
other
hand,
the
contracts
by
their
express
language
and
their
course
of
conduct,
there
was
never
any
permission
of
an
interim
rate
under
that
scheme.
mr.
charles
f.
wheatley,
jr.
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
wheatley,
jr.
well,
it
could
be
that
is
so,
but
certainly
when
the
power
act
and
the
gas
act
were
enacted
in
1935,
congress
put
in
express
interim
rate
authority,
and
it
seems
strange
that
in
1944,
which
is
a
few
years
after
that,
they
didn't
put
the
same
authority
in
there
if
they
thought
it
was
important
and
necessary.
and
i
think
the
reason
they
thought
it
wasn't
necessary
was...
goes
back
to
secretary
ickes'
concept
in
his
sponsorship
of
the
bill.
he
wanted
a
bifurcated
system
to
review,
but
he
wanted
the
federal
power
commission
review
to
be
quite
limited,
and
they
would
only
have
the
limited
function
of
approving,
and
they
did
not
have
any
broad
plenary
functions
like
the
federal
power
commission
would
have
or
the
interstate
commerce
commission
would
have.
and
he
wanted
them
also...
he
was
very
explicit
about
this,
that
they
had
to
have
the
final
say,
that
the
rate
could
not
go
into
effect,
and
we've
cited
his
comments
on
this
in
our
brief,
until
there
was
a
final
order
by
the
federal
power
commission,
and
that
one
ingredient
is
missing
here
even
after
the
doe
act.
the
secretary
of
energy,
in
his
wisdom,
decided
that
the
wanted
to
delegate
the
function
of
confirmation
and
approval
back
to
the
ferc
which
was
the
successor
agency
to
the
federal
power
commission.
so
he
delegated
that
in
his
order,
and
at
that
point
you
come
back
to
the
express
language
of
the
contracts
and
the
flood
control
act.
mr.
charles
f.
wheatley,
jr.
i
think
that
that
is
true
because
the
department
of
energy
act,
when
it
was
enacted,
simply
transferred
the
situation
as
it
existed
under
section
5
of
the
flood
control
act,
to
the
secretary
of
the
energy,
and
it's
true
that
at
that
point
the
secretary
of
the
energy
had
the
power,
the
limited
review
and
confirmation
power
of
the
fpc
plus
the
power
that
the
secretary
of
interior
had
under
the
flood
control
act.
he
had
both
those
powers,
but
those
powers
were
never
plenary
under
the
flood
control
act.
the
power
to
confirm
rates
was
not
changed
substantively,
and
all
congress
did
in
the
doe
act
was
transfer.
they
simply
transferred
what
existed
previously
and
didn't
augment
and
increase
it.
and
the
court
reports
and
the
chairman
of
the
bill,
when
it
was
enacted,
made
it
quite
clear
they
were
not
creating
any
new
substantive
power
and
authority
in
the
secretary
of
energy.
well,
the
further
sections
relating
to
the
doe
act
is
301(b)
and
302(a)(1),
both
of
those
simply
transferred
functions,
and
as
the
federal
circuit
recognized,
the
meaning
of
the
word
"transfer"
is
clear,
and
it
does
not
permit
a
definition
that
permits
the
augmentation
of
the
prior
powers.
now,
nothing
in
the
transfer
gave
any
additional
authority
in
addition
to
the
section
5
language,
and
also,
there
was
a
section
501(a)
of
the
doe
act
which
expressly
provided
that
any
procedural
requirements
under
any
prior
law
that
were
transferred
that
were
in
addition
to
that
which
the
doe
had
itself
were
to
remain
intact
and
in
place.
this
clearly
brought
with
it
the
limitations
that
were
implied
or
were
expressed
in
the
1944
act
requiring
final
confirmation
and
approval
by
the
secretary
or...
and
his
delegee,
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission.
i
mentioned
earlier
the
legislative
history
of
the
doe
act
also
where
chairman
brooks,
who
was
the
floor
manager,
said
the
secretary
would
not
have
any
powers
not
already
created
by
congress,
and
that's
cited
at
page
40
of
our
brief.
and
chairman
dunham
of
the
federal
power
commission
in
the
senate
hearings
relating
to
the
doe
act
said
he
could
separate
reorganization
from
substantive
authority
and
he
looked
and
construed
the
doe
act
as
simply
a
reorganization
act
and
not
as
an
act
investing
the
doe
with
any
additional
authorities
other
than
that
which
it
had
under
the
transferred
acts.
now,
the
government's
position
that
the
consolidation
of
the
flood
control
act
and
the
doe
act
gives
plenary
authority
over
rate
increases
and
interim
rate
authority
we
think
is
patently
wrong.
and
the
decision
by
the
federal
circuit
below
adopted
a
district
court
opinion
in
the
sam
rayburn
dam
case,
where
that
issue
was
gone
over
very
carefully
and
clearly
shows
and
demonstrates
that
the
doe
act
did
not
intend
to
augment
any
powers
that
were
previously
involved.
but
regardless
of
the
legislative
history,
i
think
there's
one
bottom
line
that
comes
out.
that
is
that
when
the
secretary
delegated
his
authority
for
the
final
approval
and
confirmation,
he
was
at
that
point,
to
the
ferc,
at
that
point
until
that
final
approval
and
confirmation
took
place,
there
was
no
completion
of
the
exact
event
which
the
statutory
language
in
the
flood
control
act,
which
is
still
valid,
had
taken,
had
occurred,
it
would
take
place.
well,
i
think
that
that
completes
my
argument.
unless
there
are
further
questions,
i
will
just
relinquish
the
rest
of
my
time.
