mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
federal
government
operates
over
100
hydroelectric
dams
on
the
nation's
waterways
that
generate
electric
power.
this
case
concerns
the
scope
of
the
secretary
of
energy's
authority
to
set
the
rates
at
which
this
power
is
sold
to
the
public.
specifically,
the
question
presented
here
is
whether
the
secretary
may
place
a
rate
increase
into
effect
on
an
interim
basis
pending
a
final
determination
regarding
the
propriety
of
the
new
rate.
in
april
1978,
the
southwestern
power
administration,
the
entity
whose
rates
are
in
dispute,
issued
a
public
notice
of
a
proposed
rate
increase.
the
notice
stated
that
the
swpa
was
running
a
deficit
of
approximately
$20
million
and
proposed
a
tentative
42
percent
rate
increase
to
enable
the
swpa's
revenues
to
cover
its
costs.
the
notice
solicited
written
comments
and
the
swpa
subsequently
held
public
meetings
to
inform
interested
parties
about
the
proposed
rate
increase
and
to
obtain
oral
comments
concerning
the
proposal.
after
considering
the
public
comments,
the
swpa
reduced
the
rate
increase
to
33
percent
and
submitted
it
to
the
assistant
secretary
of
energy
for
his
approval.
the
assistant
secretary
reviewed
the
public
comments
and
observed
that
this
was
the
first
rate
increase
in
the
swpa's
general
rates
in
over
20
years.
he
concluded
that
the
rate
increase
satisfied
the
applicable
statutory
standard
because
it
would
generate
revenues
that
would
equal
but
not
exceed
the
swpa's
costs
of
generating
the
power.
the
assistant
secretary
therefore
issued
an
order
confirming
and
approving
the
rates
and
placing
them
into
effect
on
an
interim
basis
pending
final
action
by
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission.
the
assistant
secretary's
order
specified
that
customers
who
paid
the
interim
rates
would
receive
a
refund
with
interest
if
a
lower
rate
eventually
was
placed
into
effect
by
the
ferc.
the
ferc
again
solicited
public
comments
regarding
the
rates
and
at
first
issued
a
decision
disapproving
the
rates
because
they
were
too
low.
it
founds
that
the
rates
in
fact
would
not
generate
revenues
equal
to
the
swpa's
costs
of
producing
the
electricity.
after
reviewing
additional
data
that
was
subsequently
submitted
in
support
of
the
rates,
the
ferc
reversed
itself
and
approved
the
new
rates
in
january
1982,
33
months
after
the
rates
had
been
placed
into
effect
on
an
interim
basis
by
the
assistant
secretary.
respondents
commenced
this
action
in
the
court
of
claims
seeking
to
recover
the
money
paid
pursuant
to
the
rate
increase.
they
did
not...
do
not
challenge
the
amount
of
the
rate
increase.
they
argue
only
that
the
assistant
secretary
cannot
place
rates
into
effect
on
an
interim
basis.
the
court
of
claims
held
that
the
secretary
lacked
the
statutory
authority
to
place
interim
rates
into
effect
and
that
respondents'
contracts
with
the
united
states
also
barred
the
interim
rate
increase.
following
a
remand
to
it
for
the
calculation
of
damages,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit
reached
the
same
conclusion.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
the
rates...
the
rates
are
proposed
by
the
swpa
or
the
other...
any
other
power
marketing
administration.
they
are
examined
by
the
assistant
secretary
who
issues
an
order
directing
the
customers
to
pay
the
rate
increase,
but
providing
that
the
rate,
that
those
amounts
are
subject
to
refund
if
the
<ferc>
[=
ferc],
which
then
considers
the
rate
increase,
determines
that
it
is
too
high
and
substitutes
a
lower
rate
increase.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
this
case,
this
case
is...
in
the
interstate
commerce
commission
example,
and
indeed,
in
private
utility
regulation,
the
utility
typically
files
a
rate
which
will
take
effect
but
is
subject
to
suspension
by
the
relevant
regulatory
body.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
don't
believe
that
it's
impounded.
i
think
that
the
utility
is
under,
simply
under
an
obligation
to
repay
the
money
if
it
is
eventually
found
that
the
rate
increase
is
too
high.
here
the
rate
before
it
is
placed
into
effect
is
actually
measured
by
the
government,
by
the
assistant
secretary
of
energy,
against
the
applicable
statutory
standard
here,
the
standard
that
rates
should
be
set
at
a
level
that
recoup
revenues
but
don't
provide
any
provide
to
the
government.
so
here
customers
are
actually
in
a
better
position
than
they
are
in
typical
regulation
because
the
rates
already
have
been
assessed
for
their
propriety
by
the
government.
so
it
is
especially
peculiar
that
in
this
context,
where
the
rates
already
have
been
evaluated,
even
before
they
go
into
effect
on
an
interim
basis,
the
courts
below
found
that
the
secretary
doesn't
have
this
interim
rate-setting
authority.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
we
haven't
taken
that
position,
and
that
question
isn't
presented
in
this
case.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
not
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor,
and
that's
not
what
we're
contending
here.
here
the
date
of
the
assistant,
that
the
assistant
secretary
issued
his
order
in
march
1979,
and
the
interim
rate
took
effect
on
april
1,
1979.
so
we
are
not
contending
for
any
retroactive
authority
here.
the
rates,
the
respondents
were
permitted
to
comment
on
the
rates
before
the
assistant
secretary
reached
his
decision.
the
assistant
secretary
reached
his
decision,
and
only
then
did
the
rates
take
effect.
so
this
case
does
not
involve
any
retroactive
rate
increases.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
your
honor,
and
that
long
delay
is
the
problem
that
the
secretary
faces
in
trying
to
recoup
the
cost
of
electricity
for
that
what
respondents...
the
result
that
for
which
respondents
contend
would
have
deprived
the
government
of
the
incremental
revenue
for
that
entire
33
month
period
and
essentially
given
them
a
windfall
of
paying
rates
that
had
already
been
determined
to
be
below
cost
for
that
entire
period
of
time.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
understand
from
the
department
of
energy,
your
honor,
that
the
process
has
been
speeded
up
somewhat--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--since
these
early
days.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
don't
have
the
specific
amount
of
time,
but
i
gather
that
it
no
longer
takes
approximately
three
years
to
place
rates
into
effect,
but
the
delay
still
can
be
substantial,
and
there's
no
reason
why
interim
rates
can't
be
placed
in
effect
since
respondents
essentially
suffer
no
harm
because
if
the
rate
is
subsequently
found
to
be
too
high,
they
are
entitled
to
a
refund.
since
interim
rates
are
such
a
typical
feature
of
conventional
ratemaking,
there's
no
reason
for
the
secretary
to
be
deprived
of
that
authority
here.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
your
honor,
we
contend--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
your
honor,
we
don't
think
it's
a
problem
because
we
don't
think
that--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
what
the
additional
review
does
is
impose
safeguards
for
taxpayers'
rights
to
revenues
that
recoup
costs
and
also
safeguards
respondents'
rights
by
giving
them
an
additional
review
to
ensure
that
rates
aren't
too
high.
so
we
don't...
there's
no
prejudice
to
anyone
here.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
the
ferc
at
first
thought
that
the
assistant
secretary
was
wrong
and
that
the
rates
were
too
low,
and
it
subsequently
was
convinced,
upon
getting
some
more
information,
that
the
rates
were
appropriate.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
your
honor,
the
ferc
cannot...
can
only
approve
or
disapprove
a
rate.
it
cannot
change
the
rate
under
the...
under
the
scheme
that
the
secretary
has
set
up
in
the
delegation
order.
what
would
happen
if
the
ferc
in
this
case,
for
example,
had
adhered
to
its
view
that
the
rate
was
too
low,
that
it
would
send
the
matter
back
the
the
assistant
secretary
who
would
then
have
to
devise
another
rate
that
met
the
ferc's
objection.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
exactly,
your
honor.
we
think
that
the
contract
provisions
simply
say
that
the
secretary
may
exercise
the
full
extent
of
his
statutory
ratemaking
authority.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
of
the
contracts,
your
honor?
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
we
believe,
we
believe
that
the
secretary
of
energy
is
substituted
for
the
federal
power
commission
in
the
statute,
that
the
department
of
energy
organization
act
provides
that
except
for
authority,
that
with
respect
to
authority
previously
possessed
by
the
federal
power
commission,
it's
basically
divided
into
two
parts.
the
act
specifically
designates
certain
authority
that
is
transferred
to
the
ferc,
and
it
provides
that
all
the
rest
of
the
federal
power
commission's
authority
shall
be
transferred
to
the
secretary,
and
since
this
authority
under
section
5
of
the
flood
control
act
is
not
specifically
set
forth
in
the
department
of
energy
organization
act
as
one
of
those
bits
of
authority
that
is
transferred
to
the
ferc,
it
clearly
is
transferred
to
the
secretary
of
energy
by
that
statute,
and
that
is
set
out
in
our
brief
and
also
in
the
fifth
circuit's
opinion
in
the
tex-la
case,
and
we
think
the
court
of
claims
simply
made
a
mistake
in
reading
the
statute
to
transfer
that
authority
to
the
ferc.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
exactly,
your
honor,
and
i
should
point
out
that
respondents
in
their
brief
do
not
take
a
different
position.
they
agree
that
the
secretary
could
change
the
delegation
order
and
provide
that
he
alone
exercises
authority
to
confirm
and
approve
rates
and
eliminate
the
ferc
completely
from
the
process,
and
that
would
be
permissible
under
the
statute.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
the
fifth
circuit--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes,
justice
brennan.
the
fifth
circuit
said,
in
fact,
that
in
its
view
the
court
of
claims
had
simply
misread
the
statute,
and
it
pointed
out
the
reasons
that
it
was
clear
from
the
statute
that
the
federal
power
commission's
authority
had
been
transferred
to
the
secretary
of
energy.
the
court
of
claims
invalidated
the
rest
of
its
decision
invalidating
the
rates
on
three
bases,
most
of
which
we've
talked
about.
first,
it
found
that
the
interim
rate
increases
were
barred
under
the
contracts,
but
as
i've
discussed,
the
contract
provisions
simply
provide
that
the
secretary
of
energy
may
exercise
his
full
statutory
authority.
so
really
there
is
no
separate
contract
question
in
this
case.
the
contract
question
is
the
same
as
the
statutory
question,
whether
the
secretary
has
the
statutory
authority
to
impose
interim
rates.
the
second
ground
relied
upon
by
the
court
of
claims
is
its
view
that
congress
did
not
transfer
the
federal
power
commission's
authority
to
the
ferc.
however,
as
the
fifth
circuit
pointed
out
and
as
we
demonstrate
in
our
briefs,
it's
quite
clear
that
the
department
of
energy
organization
act
expressly
transfers
that
authority
to
the
secretary
of
energy,
and
that
the
ferc's
involvement
in
this
process
is
solely
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
secretary
determined
that
review
by
the
ferc
was
appropriate
in
his
delegation
order.
so
the
only
issue
really
in
this
case
is
whether
the
secretary
has
the
authority
to
place
rates
into
effect
on
an
interim
basis,
and
we
think
that
that
authority
is
supported
on
two
separate
grounds:
first
of
all,
on
the
basis
of
section
5
of
the
flood
control
act
which
broadly
empowered
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
sell
electricity
at
the
lowest
possible
rates
to
consumers,
consistent
with
sound
business
principles,
and
in
using
such
a
general
term
to
describe
the
scope
of
the
secretary's
authority,
congress
plainly
intended
to
give
the
secretary
substantial
leeway
in
selecting
the
manner
in
which
to
administer
this
program.
basically
congress...
this
is
a
proprietary
program
selling
federal
property,
and
congress
has
directed
the
secretary
to
dispose
of
it
in
whatever
manner
he
thought
appropriate
consistent
with
the
way
a
business
would
dispose
of
a
similar
asset.
and
respondents
have
presented
no
reason
that
interim
rate
increases
should
be
excluded
from
this
broad
grant
of
authority.
and
in
fact,
interim
rate
increases
are
a
typical
conventional
ratemaking
procedure,
and
rate
regulation
schemes
governing
private
utilities
typically
provide
that
rates
may
be
placed
into
effect
on
an
interim
basis
pending
the
final
regulatory
determination.
and
the
reason
for
that
rule
is
very
simple.
the
judgment
has
been
made
that
the
regulated
utilities
should
not
be
required
to
bear
the
burden
of
financial...
of
the
loss
of
revenues
due
to
regulatory
delay.
and
interim
rates
allow
the
utility
to
obtain
the
revenue
that
it
needs
and
at
the
same
time
safeguard
the
customer's
rights
because
the
customer
is
entitled
generally
to
a
refund
with
interest
if
the
regulatory
body
later
finds
that
a
lower
rate
is
appropriate.
the
federal
power
act,
for
example,
permits
private
utilities
to
file
their
rates
and
permits
the
rates
to
go
into
effect
on
an
interim
basis,
subject
to
a
refund
if
the
lower
rate
is
adopted
by
the
ferc.
we
think
it
would
be
anomalous
to
construe
section
5
in
a
manner
that
deprived
the
federal
government
of
this
ratesetting
technique.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
your
honor,
there
are
three
examples,
three
cases
in
which
the
federal
power
commission
did
set
rates
into
effect
on
an
interim
basis,
one
example
under
this
statute,
one
example
under
the
very
similar
language
of
the
statutes
governing
the
bonneville
power
projects.
i
think
that
those
interpretations
of
the
statute
by
the
administrative
entity
that
administered
it
are
entitled
to
deference
and
show
that
the
position
for
which
we
contend
is
the
appropriate
interpretation
of
the
statute.
and
respondents
make
much
of
the
fact
that
those
are
the
only
examples,
but
this
court
has
held
several
time
that
the
mere
fact
that
an
agency
has
not
exercised
its
power
does
not
mean
that
the
power
doesn't
exist,
and
we
think
that
is
all
that
is
true
of
the
situation
cited
by
respondents
here.
respondents'
basic
argument
that
section
5
does
not
confer
interim
rate
authority
is
their
claim
that
the
statutory
provision,
the
statute
bars
the
rates
by
providing
that
rate
schedules
become
effective
upon
confirmation
and
approval
by
the
federal
power
commission,
but
we
think
this
language
simply
has
nothing
to
do
with
any
prohibition
of
interim
rates.
all
the
statute...
the
statute
does
not
require
complete
administrative
action
before
the
rates
are
placed
into
effect.
it
simply
requires
a
decision
by
the
federal
power
commission
or
the
entity
that
exercises
the
federal
power
commission's
confirmation
and
approval
authority
here,
the
assistant
secretary,
and
here
the
assistant
secretary
did
specifically
that.
before
the
interim
rates
went
into
effect,
he
issued
an
order
discussing
whether
the
rates
met
the
statutory
standard
and
expressly
confirming
and
approving
the
rates
on
an
interim
basis,
and
we
think
that
is
all
that
the
statute
requires.
there
simply
is
no
requirement
that
all
administrative
action
be
completed
before
the
rates
are
placed
into
effect.
in
addition,
it's
clear
that
congress'
purpose
in
requiring
the
federal
power
commission
to
act
is
not
at
all
furthered
by
requiring
final
approval
of
rates.
all
that
congress
wanted
was
the
federal
power
commission
to
apply
its
expertise
in
evaluating
a
rate
before
the
rate
was
placed
into
effect,
and
that's
exactly
what
happens
under
our
interpretation
of
the
statute.
before
an
interim
rate
is
placed
into
effect
the
rate
is
evaluated
under
the
statutory
standard
by
the
government
entity
that
possesses
that
authority.
i
would
also
like
to
briefly
address
our
second
argument,
that
independent
of
section
5
of
the
flood
control
act,
the
secretary's
now
plenary
authority
over
the
rates
under
the
department
of
energy
organization
act
also
permits
the
secretary
to
use
interim
rates.
we
think
that
this
court
has
recognized
that
this
type
of
plenary
authority
carries
with
it
the
authority
place
rates
into
effect
on
an
interim
basis
when
that
is
necessary
to
serve
the
public
interest,
and
we
think
that
that
is
the
situation
here.
interim
rates
serve
the
public
interest,
especially
in
this
case
where
the
swpa's
revenues
had
fallen
so
far
behind
in
recouping
its
costs,
and
do
not
harm
consumers
because
the
consumers,
first
of
all,
have
the
right
to
comment
on
the
rates
before
they
go
into
effect,
have
the
review
of
the
rates
by
the
assistant
secretary,
again
before
the
rates
go
into
effect,
and
have
the
final
level
of
review
by
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
and
a
refund
if
the
ferc
decides
that
the
interim
rate
was
too
high.
in
that
situation,
we
think
there's
simply
no
reason
to
deprive
the
government
of
the
right
to
place
interim
rates
into
effect.
unless
the
court
has
any
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
