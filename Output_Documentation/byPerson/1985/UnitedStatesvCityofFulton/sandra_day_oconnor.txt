mr.
pincus,
do
you
think
that
the
statute
and
the
contract
in
question
would
permit
a
retroactive
rate
increase?
has
the
government
ever
taken
that
position
under
the
language
of
the
contract?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
notice
that,
i
notice
that
the
language
of
the
contract
says
that
there
can
be
a
change
in
the
rates
to
increase,
decrease,
modify
or
change
them,
and
they
will
become
effective
on
the
date
specified
in
the
order,
and
i
just
wondered
if
the
government
had
ever
taken
the
position
that
that
would
permit
a
retroactive
increase.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the...
do
you
contend
that
the
language
of
the
contract
goes
no
further
than
the
language
of
the
statute
itself?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
because
the
language
is
a
bit
different.
the
statute
says
the
rate
schedules
to
become
effective
upon
confirmation
and
approval
by
the
federal
power
commission.
now,
do
you
interpret
the
statute
after
the
new
creation
of
the
department
of
energy
as
substituting
the
secretary
of
energy
for
the
federal
power
commission,
or
do
you
conceive
that
ferc
stands
in
the
shoes
of
the
federal
power
commission
under
that
language?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
of
the
statute
which
i
read
to
you.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
pincus,
what
evidence
is
there
that
under
the
old
scheme,
before
there
was
a
department
of
energy,
that
the
federal
power
authority
interpreted
the
act
as
giving
it
the
power
to
set
interim
rates?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
wheatley--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--do
you
think
the
contract
provisions
have
independent
significance
apart
from
the
statute,
or
does
the
contract
permit
what
the
statute
permits?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
as
i
read
the
contract,
it
would
even
allow
a
retroactive
increase.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
the
language
of
the
contract,
if
that's
what
you
are
relying
on,
may
be
more
generous
than
the
government
even
urges.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
on
the
effective
date
specified.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
take
the
position
that
in
any
event,
it
wouldn't
be
allowed
under
the
statute
either,
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
what
if
all
you
had
was
the
language
of
the
statute
and
the
history
of
its
application
by
the
federal
power
commission?
could
it
establish
interim
rates?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
take
the
position
that
even
had
there
been
no
delegation
to
ferc,
no
interim
rate
would
be
possible,
is
that
right?
