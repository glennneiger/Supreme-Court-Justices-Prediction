ms.
anne
c.
paskow
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
even
under
an
independent
review
standard,
mr.
miller's
1973
confession
to
the
brutal
murder
of
17
year
old
deborah
margolin
should
be
found
voluntary,
and
so
it
was
by
both
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
and
the
third
circuit.
however,
this
court
need
never
reach
that
issue
because
as
respondents
submit,
under
2254(d),
deference
should
be
accorded
to
the
factual
findings
of
the
state
court,
including,
as
in
this
case,
the
factual
finding
concerning
miller's
state
of
mind,
that
is,
that
his
will
was
not
overborne.
since
the
factual
findings
by
the
state
supreme
court
were
fairly
supported
by
the
record,
the
third
circuit
properly
paid
deference
to
them,
and
having
also
found
that
the
state
court
applied
the
correct
legal
standard,
properly
concluded
that
the
confession
was
voluntary.
ms.
anne
c.
paskow
i
believe
that
the
state
court
found
that
he
was
not
deceived
into
believing
that
boyce
was
anything
other
than
an
investigating
officer
investigating
a
crime.
i
think
that
comes
the
closest
to
answering
your
question.
ms.
anne
c.
paskow
perhaps
that's
so,
but--
ms.
anne
c.
paskow
--we
think
there
was
very
little
deception.
ms.
anne
c.
paskow
no,
sir.
ms.
anne
c.
paskow
no,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
that
was
done
always
in
the
context
of
him
being
a
police
officer,
and
whatever
help
would
be
available
would
be
in
the
context
of
a
criminal
prosecution,
and
that
was
always
understood
by
the
defendant,
as
evidenced
by
several
of
his
answers
that
we
have
cited
and
highlighted
in
our
brief.
ms.
anne
c.
paskow
yes.
ms.
anne
c.
paskow
no,
sir,
not
in
this
case.
ms.
anne
c.
paskow
we
think
we
do
win
this
case.
we
think
that
this
interrogation
was
proper
because
the
bottom
line
being
his
will
was
not
overborne,
that
he
confessed
because
it
was
his
own
rational
choice
to
confess
and
not
because
of
any
misstatements
on
the
part
of
the
police.
if
one
wants
to
characterize
something
as
deception
in
this
case,
i
would
think
they
would
have
to
be
pebbles
of
deception
as
compared
with
boulders
of
overwhelming
evidence
that
were
presented,
and
i
think
the
most
compelling
things
that
were
shown
to
this
defendant
during
the
interrogation
was
that
he...
a
car
identically
matching
his
vehicle
which
was
a
very
unique
vehicle
was
seen
at
the
margolin
farm
immediately
before
she
disappeared
and
was
murdered,
and
her
blood
was
found
in
his
car.
ms.
anne
c.
paskow
i
don't
think
there's
anything
more
compelling--
ms.
anne
c.
paskow
--excuse
me?
ms.
anne
c.
paskow
that,
that
was
never
developed
at
trial.
we
don't
know
exactly
where
that
statement
comes
from.
it
might
be--
ms.
anne
c.
paskow
--that
the
statement
was
made?
ms.
anne
c.
paskow
we
don't
know
whether
he
incorrectly
stated
it
or
correctly
stated
it.
we
know
that
he
stated
it.
we
don't
know
whether
or
not
it
was
correct--
ms.
anne
c.
paskow
--i
don't
think
it
was
a
relevant
fact
for
them
to
make
in
order
to
come
to
their--
ms.
anne
c.
paskow
--if
it
had
been
significant
in
the
decision,
they
would
have
made
a
specific
finding
with
respect
to
it.
i
think
that
they
took
it
in
the
context
of
the
entire
interrogation
as
to
what
happened
there,
and
they
might
not
have
even
identified
it
as
a
misstatement,
if
in
fact
it
was.
and
i'd
like
to
emphasize
again
that
really,
the
two
compelling
items
that
were
demonstrated
were
the
fact
that
her
blood
was
found
in
his
vehicle,
and
that
his
vehicle
was
seen
at
the
farm
immediately
prior
to
the
murder,
and
faced
with
that
evidence,
it
was
really
very
clear
that
this
defendant
had
committed
the
murder,
and
he
was
aware
of
that.
he
tried
to
exculpate
himself
throughout
the
interrogation,
and
when
he
realized
he
couldn't,
he
decided
he
would
confess
to
it.
in
support
of
our
position
that
the
presumption
of
correctness
was
properly
applied
in
this
case,
we
would
rely
on
the
purpose
of
2254(d)
as
evidenced
by
the
legislative
history,
then
recent
decisions
of
this
court
as
previously
mentioned
by
justice
rehnquist,
and
also
schneckloth,
which--
ms.
anne
c.
paskow
--there
are
cases
going
the
other
way.
i
would
say
the
majority
of
them
probably
predate
the
1966
amendment
to
the,
to
the
habeas
corpus
statute,
and
for
that,
in
that
regard,
they
have
to
be
somewhat
discounted.
i
think
the
federal
statute
sets
out
what
the
standard
is
to
be
applied,
and
we
have
to
look
at
the
voluntariness
cases
in
light
thereof
now.
ms.
anne
c.
paskow
but
i
don't
think
there
was
the
sensitivity
to
the
distinction
between--
ms.
anne
c.
paskow
--that's
correct,
and
we
would
say
that
state
of
mind
of
a
defendant
is
traditionally
something
that
should
be
considered
a
fact.
ms.
anne
c.
paskow
i
think--
ms.
anne
c.
paskow
--i
think
you
can
read
some
of
the
older
cases
to
say
just
about
both
sides
of
the
question.
i
think--
ms.
anne
c.
paskow
--culombe
also
has
justice
frankfurter's
language
that
you
quoted
before
that--
ms.
anne
c.
paskow
--i
think,
i
think
the
way
to
really
look
at
culombe
is
more
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
themselves
are,
were
inherently
unconstitutional
or
involuntary,
per
se,
that
voluntariness
in
that
case
was
looked
at
more
as...
that
the
legal
standard
being
applied
was
being...
that
anything
under
those
circumstances
would
have
been
involuntary
regardless
of
the
effect
it
would
have
on
defendant's
will.
ms.
anne
c.
paskow
well,
of
course,
that
case
didn't
come
up
in
a
habeas
context
so
that
we
don't
have
the
2254(d)
presumption
applying
in
that
case,
and
i
think
that's
a
distinguishing
feature.
also,
the
facts
in
mincey
are
equally
egregious,
and
i
think
if
that
had
come
up,
that
the
duty
of
context--
ms.
anne
c.
paskow
--i
think
mincey
could
very
easily
have
been
analyzed
as
being
per
se
the
tactics
employed
and
per
se
unconstitutional
without
reaching--
ms.
anne
c.
paskow
--well,
i
think
the
court
examined
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
there
on
an
independent
review,
which
of
course
would
not
occur
in
a
habeas
context.
again,
state
of
mind
of
the
defendant
can
still
be
characterized,
as
we
do,
as
a
factual
element
which
deference
should
be
paid
to
unless
there
is
fair
support
for
it.
so
mincey
could
very
easily
have
been
analyzed
in
that
fashion,
that
there
was
not
fair
support
for
what
the
trial
court,
the
arizona
courts
had
done
in
that
case,
or
at
the
other
extreme,
it
could
have
been
analyzed
as
the
tactics
in
and
of
themselves
were
so
offensive
to
due
process
that
you
wouldn't
even
reach
the
question
of
whether
or
not
mr.
mincey's
will
was
overborne.
ms.
anne
c.
paskow
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
recall.
ms.
anne
c.
paskow
frankly,
your
honor,
i
can't
say
that
i
am,
but
if
in
fact
it
stands
for
the
proposition
that
your
honor
has
said,
i
would
suggest
that
now
we
should
come
further
from
there
and
give
effect
to
what
congress
has
said
2254(d)
with
respect
to--
ms.
anne
c.
paskow
--since
that
time
we
have
had,
we've
had
patton
v.
yount
and
we've
had--
ms.
anne
c.
paskow
--yes,
i
believe
we
have,
and
i
believe
state
of
mind
in
the
more
recent
cases
has
been
viewed
as
a
factual
element,
more
so
than
perhaps
in
the
past,
and
properly
so,
and--
ms.
anne
c.
paskow
--as
i
said,
i'm
not
that
familiar
with
the
case
to
be
able
to
answer
the
question.
i
will
rely
on
your
honor
if
you
are
saying
that.
going
back
to
the
purpose
of--
ms.
anne
c.
paskow
--going
back
to
the
purpose
of
2254(d),
and
the
1966
amendments,
we
said...
we
would
say
that
the
purpose
of
those
amendments
was
to
promote
finality
and
federalism
by
limiting
readjudication
of
state
court
fact
findings,
of
which
we
characterize
the
state
of
mind,
unless
there
was
not
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
for
hearing
and
the
facts
were
not
fairly
supported
by
the
record,
and
the
remedial
nature
of
these
amendments
suggests
that
they
should
be
broadly
construed
by
this
court.
the
recent
decisions
of
this
court,
as
we've
mentioned,
patton
v.
yount,
wainright
v.
witt,
marshall
v.
lonberger,
suggest
a
progression
with
respect
to
how
we
are
considering
the
state
of
mind
findings
and
support
our
position
in
this
case,
we
believe.
that
is
what
the
third
circuit
did.
they
characterized
what
the
state
of
mind
of
the
defendant,
whether
or
not
his
will
was
overborne,
as
one
of
the
state
of
mind
factfindings
along
the
lines
of
those,
the
recent
decisions
of
this
court,
and
properly
paid
deference
to
what
the
state
courts
did.
again,
in
schneckloth
where
the
voluntariness
of
the
consent
to
search
was
in
issue,
this
court
said
that
that's
a
factual
question
to
be
determined
by
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
and
we
would
suggest
that
that
statement
was
equally
applicable
here.
we
do
not
believe
that
it
is
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law
as
mr.
miller's
counsel
has
suggested,
that
the
umbrella
term,
voluntariness,
as
it
has
been
loosely
used
in
a
number
of
decisions,
describes
both
a
legal
standard
to
evaluate
the
confession
and
the
factual
question
of
whether
the
will
has
been
overborne.
the
first
part,
of
course,
is
the
legal,
determining
what
the
legal
standard
is
to
apply;
the
second
part,
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
whether
his
will
was
overborne,
really
describes
a
factual
question.
the
third
circuit
here
we
feel
did
not
apply
the
presumption
to
the
state
court's
finding
of
voluntariness
but
rather
applied
the
presumption
to
the
findings
involving
the
effect
of
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
interview
on
defendant's
decision
to
confess.
we
also
would
submit
that
this
confession
was
not
involuntary
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
what
went
on
here
cannot
be
described
as
similar
to
the
terror
tactics
such
as
torture,
deprivation
of
food
and
water,
threats
of
violence
or
mob
action.
ms.
anne
c.
paskow
i
do
not
condone
the
use
of
false
information
or
suggestions.
i
don't
know
that
that
was
done
in
this
case.
i
don't
think
there
were
intentional
falsehoods
use
in
this
case
or
intentional
deceptions
used
in
this
case.
ms.
anne
c.
paskow
well,
i
think
we
do
know
that
they've
been--
ms.
anne
c.
paskow
--whether
or
not
the
trier
of
fact
found
that
there
actually
was
deception
or
whether
or
not
the
trier
of
fact
found
that
the
deception
did
not
have
the
effect
of
overbearing
will,
i
think
the
result
is
the
same
because
the
other
fact
that
was
found
by
the
court
here
was
that
the
will
was
not
overborne.
ms.
anne
c.
paskow
well,
even
if
we
were
to
accept
that
deception
was
used
in
this
case,
i
don't
think
it
affects
the
bottom
line
of
what
the
decision
should
be
because
the
will
was
not
overborne.
defendant's
will
was
not
overborne.
his
decision
to
confess
was
a
product
of
his
free
will
and
rational
mind.
that
is
i
think
one
of
the
critical
facts
of
the
case,
and
i
think
that's
probably--
ms.
anne
c.
paskow
--fifty-eight
minutes.
ms.
anne
c.
paskow
well,
no
defendant
is
going
to
be
eager
to
convey
his
involvement
in
a
murder
of
this
type,
of
course,
but
defendant
at
all
times
throughout
this
indicated
his
willingness
to
talk,
and
the
officer
testified
at
the
voluntariness
miranda
hearing
that
it
was
his
feeling
that
defendant
wanted
to
talk
and
just
wanted
to
come
out
with
what
he
had
done
to
relieve
himself
of
this.
again,
the
offers
to
see
that
defendant
receive
psychological
help
and
the
sympathetic
approach
adopted
by
the
detective
we
would
say
really
focus
on
whether
or
not
the
will
was
overborne,
and
defendant
in
this
case
always
understood
that
boyce
was
a
police
officer
acting
as
such.
similarly,
the
most
damaging
evidence
that
was
presented
to
this
defendant
in
the
course
of
the
interrogation
was
the
observations
of
his
car
at
the
farm
before
the
murder
and
the
blood
stains
on
his
vehicle,
and
this
really
was
the
linchpin
leading
him
to
confess
in
this
case.
with
respect
to
his
demeanor
during
the
interrogation,
he
was
lucid,
coherent,
rational,
he
was
cynical
at
times,
independent
and
argumentative.
he
weighed
the
evidence.
he
was
able
to
fabricate
a
story,
trying
to
exculpate
himself,
and
when
he
realized
that
failed,
he
was
not
able
to
account
for
the
time
period
in
some
of
this
compelling
evidence,
he
confessed
only
then.
thus
we
would
say
that
even
on
a
plenary
review
in
this
matter,
it
would
demonstrate
that
the
confession
was
voluntary.
the
briefness
of
the
interview,
the
fact
that
this
man
was
reasonably
intelligent,
he
was
advised
of
his
rights,
explicitly
waived
them
in
writing,
he
was
not
a
novice
to
the
criminal
justice
system.
just
one
month
before,
he
was
involved
in
a
similar
interrogation
situation
since
he
had
been
involved
in
another
criminal
event.
he
knew
he
could
terminate
this
interrogation
at
any
time,
which
is
a
critical
safeguard.
he
consistently
demonstrated
his
willingness
to
talk,
and
it
was
then
not
appropriate
for
the
detective
to
try
and
persuade
him
to
admit
his
guilt.
again,
any
implied
promise
of
psychological
help
was
only
in
the
context
of
an
anticipated
criminal
prosecution,
and
it's...
defendant
understood
that
as
such.
so
we
would
say
that
under
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
his
confession
was
a
product
of
his
free
will
and
rational
mind.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
we
will
rest.
