brennan,

that's
in
384
where
we
said
that...
and
it
is
a
habeas
case...
and
there
we
said
it
is
our
duty
in
cases
dealing
with
a
question
whether
a
confession
was
involuntarily
given
to
examine
the
entire
record
and
make
an
independent
determination
whether
defendant's
will
had
been
overborne.
you're
not
familiar
with
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

that
was
a
1967
decision.
