they
had
a
tape
of
the
interrogation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
one
of
the
things
that
puzzles
me
about
this
case
is
what
are
we
talking
about
when
we
talk
about
historical
fact
as
opposed
to
the
ultimate
conclusion?
i
suppose
one
thing
that
we
might
be
interested
in
in
this
case
is
the
extent
to
which
there
was
deception
by
the
interrogating
officer
of
the
person
being
interrogated.
did
the
state
court
make
any
finding
one
way
or
another
on
how
much
trickery
and
deception
and
falsehood
there
was
in
the
interrogation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
did
find
there
was
the
promise.
was
it
implicit
in
that
that
it
was
a
false
promise?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
did
the
state
court
say
about
all
the
statements
to
the
effect
that
i'm
your
brother
and
you
can
trust
me
and
all
that
kind
of
stuff?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
didn't
necessarily
find
that
there
was
no
falsehood
or
deception
involved.
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
paskow,
what
are
the
state
court's
findings
on
the
question
to
which
deception
played
a
part
in
the
whole
confession?
justice
john
paul
stevens
really,
it
didn't
seem
to
me
they
addressed...
it
is
a
very
difficult
question
the
extent
to
which
deception
is
appropriate
in
an
examination
like
this,
and
i
just
don't
know
what
the
factual
predicate
on
which
the
ultimate
conclusion
was
based
really
was,
whether
they
thought
there
was
quite
a
bit
of
deception
but
it
was
perfectly
proper,
or
they
thought
there
really
wasn't
very
much
and
it
didn't
have
much
effect
on
him.
and
i
think
one
can
read,
read
the
transcript
or
listen
to
the
tape
and
draw
either
conclusion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
state
have
a
position
on
whether
there
was
a
significant
amount
of
deception
employed
in
the
interrogation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
all
the
talk
about
how
he
was
really
your
brother
and
i'm
trying
to
help
you
and
all
that,
that
that
wasn't
deceptive
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
take
it
one
step
further,
if
i
may.
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
one
disagreed
with
that
and
thought
it
was
deceptive,
that
there
was
a
misleading
impression
that
the
man
was
really
not
an
adversary
but
was
trying
to
help
a
person
in
need
of
psychiatric
help.
would
that
make
it
involuntary?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
win
on
either
approach
to
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
on
his
doorstep.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
on
his
doorstep.
and
on
his
doorstep,
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
on
his
doorstep.
but
that
wasn't
proved.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
we
know
whether,
do
we
assume
it
was
made
or
it
was
not
made,
under
the
state
court's
findings
of
fact,
or
don't
we
know?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
the
interrogating
officer
incorrectly
stated
that
blood
had
been
found
at
the
front
of
his
house.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
state
court
didn't
make
a
finding
one
way
or
the
other
as
to
whether
it
was
correct
or
incorrect,
or
did
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
think
if
that
was
a
false
statement
made
to
induce
him
to
confess,
that
that
wasn't
even
relevant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just
note
the
case
is
cited
four
times
in
the
blue
brief.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
what
interested
me.
you
say
you
don't
know
whether
it
happened
or
not,
and
it
seems
to
me
that's
quite
an
important
factual
predicate
for
analyzing
the
legal
question.
we
don't
know
whether
it...
you
don't
know
whether
it
happened,
the
state
court
didn't
tell
us
how
much
deception
there
was,
whether
it
was
significant,
whether
it
tended
to
motivate
the
confession,
and
yet
we
should
defer
to
these
factual
findings
that
have
never
been
made.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
have
the
ultimate
conclusion
that
it
was
a
voluntary
confession,
but
that
could
mean
that
they
thought
everything
the
interrogator
said
was
deceptive
and
tricky
and
a
lot
of
falsehood,
but
as
a
matter
of
law,
that's
perfectly
all
right,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
cases.
but
i'm
not
sure
you
are
saying
we
should
be
willing
to
go
that
far.
see,
the
law
really
is
very,
very
unclear
on
the
extent
to
which
trickery
and
deception
by
the
police
is
permissible,
and
one
of
the
problems
i
have
with
this
case
is
there
are
no
factual
findings
that
tell
me
what
the
trier
of
fact
thinks
with
respect
to
the
extent
of
deception
that
actually
took
place.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand,
but
our...
the
legal
issue
as
it
comes
to
us
is
quite
different,
depending
on
what
one
thinks
the
findings
of
subsidiary
facts
were.
that's
all
i'm
suggesting,
and
i
am
suggesting
you,
you're
not
even
prepared
to
tell
us
what
you
think
the
state
court
found
with
respect
to
the
amount
of
deception,
and
understandably
so
because
the
record
is
so
opaque.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
do
you
think
the
record
can
be
interpreted
to
mean
that
he
would
have
confessed
had
there
been
no
deception
at
all?
i
don't
think
there's
any
such
finding
in
the
record.
maybe
he
would
have.
i
don't
know.
it's
a
little
hard
to
understand.
it
took
him
an
hour
and
a
half,
or
about
an
hour,
i
guess,
to
get
him
to
confess.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
he
had
to
kind
of
pull
it
out
of
him
from
time
to
time.
i
don't
know
whether
that
is--
