justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
does
it
differ,
counsel,
from
the
question
of
whether
a
guilty
plea
was
voluntary
in
marshall
v.
lonberger
or
a
finding
that
a
particular
venireman
was
biased
in
patton
v.
yount,
and
the
competency
question
in
maggio?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
policy
decisions
are
you
talking
about?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
this
court
was
deciding.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
does
the...
let's
take
marshall
v.
lonberger.
why
does
the
question
of
whether
a
guilty
plea
was
knowingly
or
intelligently
made
differ
from
the
question
of
whether
a
confession
was
voluntarily
given
so
far
as
credibility
and
everything
else?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so
you
say
it
depends
on...
that
the
cases
i
have
referred
to
depend
on
the
fact
that
the
witnesses
were
present
before
the
judge
who
made
the
finding?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
they
dealt
with
other
constitutional
issues
certainly.
why
should
compulsory
self-incrimination
be
different
from
other
constitutional
issues?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you...
you
refer
to
our
decision
of
culombe
v.
connecticut?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
how
many
people
joined
the
opinion
to
which
you
are
referring?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
culombe
v.
connecticut?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
how
many
justices
of
the
court
joined
the
opinion
from
which
you
are
quoting?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
each
of
the
cases
that
i
mentioned
to
you
earlier,
mr.
miller,
involved
a
federal
constitutional
right,
patton
v.
yount,
marshall
v.
lonberger,
sumner
v.
mata,
and
the
maggio
case,
and
in
each
of
those
this
court
said
that
the
2254
presumption
of
correctness
applied
even
though
we
were
dealing
with
claims
of
federal
constitutional
rights.
are
you
saying
that
voluntariness
of
a
confession
stands
just
by
itself
in
this
area?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
why
should
voluntariness
of
a
confession
be
a
"mixed
question"
when
the
bias
of
a
juror,
the
suggestibility
of
a
pretrial
identification,
a
competency
standard,
when
they
apparently
are
not
mixed
questions?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
still
has
to
be
done
by
hearing
witnesses
in
open
court,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
but
that's
the
only...
unless
you
have
some
sort
of
a
tape
or
a
videotape,
that's
the
best
way
we
have
of
finding
out
what
went
on
during
the
interrogation
is
examining
the
witnesses
who
were
present.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
state
courts
here
had
live
witnesses
before
them,
didn't
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
guess
i
just
don't
follow
your
reasoning.
they
had
a
tape
of
the
interrogation.
