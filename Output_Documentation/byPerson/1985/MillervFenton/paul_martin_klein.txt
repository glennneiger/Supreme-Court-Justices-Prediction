mr.
paul
martin
klein
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
are
faced
today
with
two
issues
of
great
import.
the
first
issue
is
whether
the
voluntariness
of
a
confession
is
a
question
of
fact
to
which
this
court
and
lower
federal
courts
must
defer.
and
the
second
issue
is
whether
the
petitioner's
confession
was
involuntarily
obtained
by
police
practices
which
operated
to
overhear
his
will.
we
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals'
use
of
the
presumption
of
correctness
deprived
petitioner
of
his
statutory
right
to
federal
plenary
judicial
review,
and
if
this
court
affirms
the
decision
below,
it
will
displace
the
ultimate
authority
to
decide
the
questions
of
constitutionality
of
confession
from
federal
courts
where
congress
placed
it
and
where
this
court
has
consistently
recognized
it
belongs.
with
regard
to
this
issue,
it
is
crucial
that
we
look
to
the
nature
of
the
voluntariness
inquiry
itself
and
to
the
nature
of
the
federal
courts'
role
in
constitutional
adjudication.
we
would
first
contend
that
the
nature
of
the
voluntariness
inquiry
itself
makes
it
a
mixed
question
not
subject
to
the
strictures
of
section
2254(d).
the
constitutionally
required
test
is
totality.
this
is
an
indivisible
concept.
it
is
not
just
a
review
of
facts
but
the
application
of
law
to
those
facts,
not
just
determine--
mr.
paul
martin
klein
--yes,
your
honor,
these
were
the
decisions
relied
on
by
the
third
circuit,
and
i
would
say
that
the
policy
decisions
there
are
totally
different.
if
you
look
at
what
was
decided
in
those
cases--
mr.
paul
martin
klein
--decisions...
what
the
courts
were
deciding
there,
what
they
were
pleading--
mr.
paul
martin
klein
--what
this
court
was
deciding
there
were
questions
of
credibility
and
demeanor
which
the
court,
the
state
courts
were
in
a
superior
position
or
had
a
superior
opportunity
to
review,
to
assess,
to
judge--
mr.
paul
martin
klein
--when
you
are
dealing
with
voluntariness
of
a
confession
and
you
have
a
defendant
or
a
petitioner
in
front
of
you,
you
cannot
deal
with
the
assessment
of
credibility
and
demeanor
at
a
closed,
inherently
secret
and
inherently
coercive
setting
such
as
an
interrogation.
the
court
in
marshall
v.
lonberger
was
able
to
question
the
defendant
there
and
was
also
able
to
look
to
state
court
records
of
things
that
were
conducted
in
open
court,
with
a
court
stenographer,
with
all
the
safeguards
available
to
the
individual.
you
don't
have
that
in
an
interrogation
situation.
mr.
paul
martin
klein
that
appears
to
be
one
of
the
factors
involved.
the
other
is
the
question
involved.
none
of
those
cases
dealt
with
the
question
of
compulsory
self-incrimination.
mr.
paul
martin
klein
i
think
that
congress
has
recognized
and
this
court
has
recognized
that
when
you
are
dealing
with
voluntariness
of
a
confession,
you
are
dealing
with...
excuse
me,
i
lost
myself
for
a
second...
voluntariness
of
a
confession,
that
state
courts
do
not
offer
the
proper
institutional
setting
for
final
adjudication
of
federal
rights,
and
that
in
the
past
and
the
potential
is
still
there
for
state
courts
to
defeat
federal
claims
by
failing
to,
as
the
court
said
in
culombe,
to
draw
the
inferences
that
the
historical
facts
compel.
mr.
paul
martin
klein
culombe--
mr.
paul
martin
klein
--in
culombe?
mr.
paul
martin
klein
i
guess.
mr.
paul
martin
klein
i
thought
it
was
three
or
four.
certainly
i
think
the
concern
of
congress
has
been
that
the
state
court,
state
courts
are
not
insulated
enough
from
local
community
sentiment,
from
the
question
of
guilt
and
innocence
itself,
and
that
a
further
proceeding
would
be
needed
in
this
court
to
protect,
to
ultimately
vindicate
those
rights.
now,
if
you
look
at
the
problem
here,
if
you
look
at
what
the
state
court
had
before
it,
it
is
the
same
thing
that
this
court
has
before
it
now.
what
it
had
on
one
hand
were
a
set
of
pure
historical
facts,
and
on
the
other
hand,
undisputed
rule
of
law.
that
law
is
whether
under
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
petitioner's
will
had
been
overborne;
was
his
confession
compelled
from
him,
and
the
state
court
took
that
undisputed
rule
of
law,
applied
it
to
the
facts,
and
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
law
in
fact
had
not
been
violated.
this
by
definition
is
a
mixed
question,
and
what
the
third
circuit
did,
we
contend,
was
to
abdicate
its
duty
to
this
argument's
question
of
law
and
fact.
what
it
did
was
classify
as
pure
fact
certain
conclusions
of
the
state
court,
and
when
we
look
at
those
conclusions,
one
of
the
conclusions
was
that
the
distress
and
ultimate
collapse
of
petitioner
after
giving
his
confession
was
caused
by
realization
of
what
he
had
done,
and
that
when
he
confessed
he
was
aware
that
he
would
be
handled
through
the
criminal
justice
system.
these
we
contend
are
not
pure
historical
facts,
but
require
application
of
law
to
the
facts
to
reach
that
conclusion.
that
conclusion
in
itself
is
dispositive
of
the
constitutional
claim.
when
you
say
that
someone
collapsed
or
was
in
distress
because
of
a
realization
of
what
he
had
done,
you
are
basically
saying
that
his
will
had
not...
his
confession
had
not
been
compelled
from
him.
these
are
not
the
types
of
facts
that
section
2254(d)
was
intended
to
encompass.
i
think
what
2254(d)
intended
to
encompass
were
findings
of
either
pure
historical
fact,
facts
that
this
court
has
defined
as
recitation
of
the
external
events
and
the
credibility
of
their
narrator,
or
inferences
from
those
facts
which
can
be
made
without
reference
to
legal
standard,
without
applying
the
standard
of
law
to
the
facts
in
reaching
a
conclusion.
for
example,
if
in
this
case
petitioner
had
claimed
that
he
had
been
starved
or
that
he
had
no
working
knowledge
of
the
english
language,
all
you
need
do
is
go
to
the
record
and
listen
to
defendant
speaking,
listen
to
petitioner
speaking.
the
judge
was
able
to
observe
petitioner
in
court.
petitioner
did
testify
at
a
pretrial
hearing,
and
you
can
infer
from
what
happened
that
in
fact
he
did
have
an
understanding
of
the
legal...
of
the
english
language.
the
same
with
the
allegation,
if
you
raise
it,
that
he
had
been
starved.
the
police
certainly
offered
him
food,
and
you
could
determine
this
from
the
record
and
thus,
these
conclusions
would
have
been
dispositive
of
the
ultimate
claims.
they
were
not
mixed
questions.
we
would
contend
that
to
adopt
the
position
of
the
third
circuit
is
to
thwart
congressional
intent
to
have
federal
courts
serve
as
the
ultimate
vindicators
of
habeas
petitioners'
constitutional
claims.
we
briefly
mentioned
the
recent
cases,
and
i
do
say
that
these
cases,
most
of
them
recognized
that
when
you
are
talking
about
mixed
questions
of
law
and
fact,
you're
talking
about
a
different
situation.
and
i
still
think
that
congress
and
this
court
has
been
very
concerned
with
the
setting
that
the
petitioners
are
in
when
they
are
being
interrogated.
and
with
this
regard,
when
we
refer
to
state
of
mind
in
the
recent
cases
such
as
patton
and
maggio,
rushen
v.
spain,
you
are
talking
about
something
different
from
the
state
of
mind
in
a
voluntariness
case,
voluntariness
of
confession.
state
of
mind
is
really
synonymous
with
whether
petitioner
voluntarily
gave
the
confession,
and
certainly
state
of
mind
cannot
be
determined
other
than
by
inference
from
what
had
happened,
from
the
facts
that
you
have,
drawing
inferences,
getting
at
the
truth
is
a
very
difficult
situation
in
voluntariness
cases.
i
would
also
note
that
in
the
third
circuit
they
referred
to
miranda
warnings
as
also
causing
some
kind
of
doctrinal
upheaval.
we
would
submit
that
in
this
case
or
in
all
cases,
miranda
warnings
have
not
replaced
the
voluntariness
test,
the
voluntariness
standard.
that
is
a
prophylactic
rule,
and
it
is
not
designed
to
do
away
with
the
test
involved
in
hutto
v.
ross.
the
court...
there
the
petitioner
had
in
fact
been
given
his
miranda
warnings
and
had
counsel
present,
and
these
were
just
factors
to
assess
in
reaching
the
ultimate
conclusion.
the
state
of
mind
is
just
one
part
of
the
equation
in
a
voluntariness
of
confession
case.
mr.
paul
martin
klein
an
independent
determination
of
course
deferring
to
the
historical
facts
or
the--
mr.
paul
martin
klein
--yes.
mr.
paul
martin
klein
no.
when
the...
and
this
is
a
difficult
area
to
draw
a
line
in...
i
think
when
you
have
to
resort
to
a
legal
standard,
apply
a
legal
standard
to
the
facts
to
reach
this
conclusion
or
inference,
then
you
are
talking
about
a
mixed
question.
certainly
there
are
facts
there--
mr.
paul
martin
klein
--yes.
mr.
paul
martin
klein
provided
that
they
are
done
without
reference
to
the
legal
standard,
yes.
mr.
paul
martin
klein
yes,
i
would.
mr.
paul
martin
klein
i
think
when
we're
talking
about
questions
of
credibility
and
demeanor.
mr.
paul
martin
klein
the...
excuse
me?
mr.
paul
martin
klein
when
those
ultimate
conclusions
don't
need
an
application
of
legal
standards--
mr.
paul
martin
klein
--yes,
and
in
cases
of
this
nature,
the
court--
mr.
paul
martin
klein
--culombe,
yes.
mr.
paul
martin
klein
i
did
not
disagree.
maybe
i
misunderstood
you,
but
i
didn't
disagree
with
what
he
was
saying.
mr.
paul
martin
klein
well,
i
didn't
see
it
that
way.
mr.
paul
martin
klein
i
don't
think
that
we
have
the
same
type
of
abuses
that
the
early
courts
were
dealing
with
here.
i
think
the
concern
is
the
potential.
certainly
we
still
have
situations
coming
up
here,
factual
situations
such
as
in
mincey.
we
have
new
standards
being
employed
by
police.
certainly
the
brutal
tactics
in--
mr.
paul
martin
klein
--yes,
it
could.
mr.
paul
martin
klein
i
do
not
think
that
the
fair
record
support
standard
would
be
sufficient.
i
think
congress
contemplated
a
broader
review
because
of
the
rights
being
implicated
here
and
the
potential
for
state
courts
to
defeat
federal
rights.
i
am
not
saying
that
you
certainly
don't
get
situations
like
brown
v.
mississippi
with
whippings,
with
blatant
torture
coming
before
this
court
or--
mr.
paul
martin
klein
--i
think
it
is
distinguishable,
and
i
also
think
in
those
cases
you
indicated
that
you
weren't
talking
about
mixed
questions.
mr.
paul
martin
klein
in
all
of
those
cases
the
court
is
able
to
talk
to
the...
they
have
voir
dire
of
the
jury,
jury
members,
they
are
able
to
assess
by
what
they
see
in
front
of
them,
and
in
voluntariness
of
a
confession
case
you
have
a
completely
different
situation.
you
have
a
secret
inherently
coercive
setting
where
drawing
the
truth
is
a
very
difficult
process--
mr.
paul
martin
klein
--your
hearing
witnesses
in
opening
court
doesn't
deal
with
the
credibility
or
demeanor
or
the
situation
of
what
went
on
at
the
interrogation
proceeding.
that
is--
mr.
paul
martin
klein
--this
is
correct,
but
this
court
is
in
no
different
a
position
than
the
lower
courts.
i
think
that
in
the
other
situations
this
court
found
that
the
state
courts
had
a
superior
opportunity
to
assess
what
was
happening.
they
had
the
live
witnesses
before
them.
they
could
judge
from
looking,
from
the
tone
of
the
words.
this
court--
mr.
paul
martin
klein
--they
had
live
witnesses
before
them,
but
they
weren't...
they
didn't
have
the
interrogation
before
them.
mr.
paul
martin
klein
excuse
me?
mr.
paul
martin
klein
they
had
a
tape
of
the
interrogation.
this
does
not
make
the
interrogation
any
less
secret.
the
interrogation,
the
police
are
still
in
control
of
the
interrogation.
it
is
not
taken
down
by
a
support
stenographer
in
a
courtroom
with
all
of
the
safeguards
that
are
encompassed
there.
mr.
paul
martin
klein
the
state
courts
found
that
there...
while
there
was
a
promise
of
psychiatric
help,
that
this
in
itself
was
not
coercive
enough
to
overbear
his
will,
and
it
did
not
find
that--
mr.
paul
martin
klein
--not
in
the
promise
to
help.
the
other
promises
the
court...
the
implied
promises
of
nonincarceration
the
court
rejected
saying
that
there
was
not
an
express
promise
that
the
petitioner
would
not
go
to
jail.
the
court
did
find
that
there
was
a
promise
of
psychiatric
help,
but
that
this
was
something
that
the
police
officer
couldn't
promise
the
defendant.
mr.
paul
martin
klein
they
found
that
under
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
applying
the
law
to
the
facts
as
they
saw
it,
that
this
did
not
overbear
petitioner's
will.
they
looked
to--
mr.
paul
martin
klein
--no,
they
did
not.
they--
mr.
paul
martin
klein
--they,
they
basically
said
that
if
what
the
police
did
was...
they
did
find
that
there
were
lies,
that
there
were
some
deceptive
practices,
but
that
these
practices
did
not
operate
to
overbear
petitioner's
will,
and
i
think
in
this
regard,
in
my
second
point,
i
wanted
to
note
that
this
court
has
observed
that
illegal
and
unconstitutional
practices
get
their
first
footing
by
silent
approaches
and
slight
deviations
from
the
accepted
legal
procedures,
and
i
think
this
case
is
a
perfect
example
of
where
those
silent
approaches
and
slight
deviations
can
lead.
at
the
outset
we
did
note
that
there
was
no
question
but
that
petitioner
had
received
his
warnings,
and
we
are
not
contending
that
he
didn't
understand
those
warnings
when
they
were
given.
what
we
are
contending
is
that
we
have
to
look
at
what
the
interrogator
did
after
the
warnings
were
given,
and
i
think
it's
clear
that
the
entire
thrust
of
the
interrogation
was
to
divert
petitioner
from
the
reality
of
the
criminal
justice
system,
to
undermine
any
of
the
warnings
that
had
been
given
previously,
and
to
ultimately
overbear
petitioner's
will.
the
detective
employed
a
series
of
lies,
deceptions
and
promises
during
a
constant
psychological
assault
assuring
petitioner
over
and
over
and
over
again
that
it
was
the
detective's
job
to
get
him
help,
that
petitioner
was
not
a
criminal,
that
he
was
not
responsible
for
what
had
happened,
and
that
he
should
receive
help
instead
of
punishment.
and
i
think
if
we
look
to
exactly
what--
mr.
paul
martin
klein
--these
are
findings
in
the...
to
the
extent
that
they
are
clear
on
the
tape
as
to
what
the
detective
said.
in
terms
of
its
result,
this
is
my
argument.
i
would
contend
that
there
was
absolutely
no
balance
involved
in
what
the
police
officer
did.
certainly
if
he
had
said
my
job
is
to
get
you
help,
and
i'm
here
to
make
sure
that
you
get
help
and
i'm
going
to
make
sure
that
you
get
proper
psychiatric
evaluation,
a
comfortable
cell
and
three
square
meals
for
the
rest
of
your
life,
we
wouldn't
be
here
today
because
there
would
be
a
balance
and
you
would
be
basically
letting
petitioner
know
where
he
stood.
the
purpose
of
miranda,
one
of
the
main
purposes
was
to
ensure
that
the
petitioner
knew
that
he
was
in
an
adversarial
situation
and
that
the
police
or
the
people
conducting
the
interrogation
were
not
necessarily
acting
in
his
best
interests.
and
what's
fascinating,
what
the
police
did
here,
they
had
this
chicane
all
the
way
through,
and
it
continued
until
the
end.
at
the
very
end
of
the
confession,
right
before
petitioner
collapsed,
the
police
officer
said
i
understand
you'll
be
willing
to
sit
down
and
talk
with
me
and
an
assistant
prosecutor
and
indicate
to
him
that
you
have
a
problem
so
that
you
can
get
help.
the
equation
was
throughout,
problem
and
help,
not
crime
and
punishment.
what
the
interrogating
agent
did
and
what
we
contend
he
had
absolutely
no
business
doing
was
to
invoke
the
spectre
of
a
sentencing
judge,
and
what
he
accomplished,
we
feel,
was
to
undermine
the
effect
of
the
miranda
warnings.
the
attorney
general
in
her
brief
tries
to
separate
each
incident
into
a
world
of
its
own,
and
we
contend
that
in
this
type
of
a
situation
you
can't
do
it.
it's
like
a
mosaic,
each
little
piece
fits
together
and
ultimately
draws
a
picture
as
to
what
happened,
and
the
same
came
be
said
with
regard
to
the
will
of
the
petitioner
here.
each
little
deception,
each
little
promise
acted
like
a
weight
that
was
placed
upon
him,
and
while
one
little
weight
might
not
have
made
a
difference,
by
the
time
the
interrogating
agent
was
done
placing
these
weights
upon
him,
he
succeeded
in
crushing
him
and
taking
away
any
option
not
to
incriminate
himself.
we
contend
that
a
legitimization
of
these
skillful
techniques
basically
serves
to
reward
an
interrogator
who
is
clever
enough
or
devious
enough
to
avoid
brutality
and
serves
to
undermine
the
entire
spirit
of
miranda.
we
recognize
that
it
is
a
legitimate
object
to
create
an
atmosphere
where
a
defendant
might
bear
witness
to
the
truth,
but
you
have
to
recognize
that
that
atmosphere
cannot
be
made
so
as
to
take
the
option
away
from
petitioner.
i
would
like
to
reserve,
unless
there
are
any
questions,
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.

klein
no,

honor.
