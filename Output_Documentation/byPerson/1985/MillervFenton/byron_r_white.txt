justice
byron
r.
white
well,
your
suggestion
is
that
the
habeas
court
should
just
given
independent...
draw
its
own
view
as
to
voluntariness,
make
its
independent
determination.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
be
bound
by
the
historical
facts,
if
supported
by
the
record.
justice
byron
r.
white
being
bound...
and
what
about
inferences
from
other
fact,
to
other
facts,
of
other
facts
from
those
facts,
the
same
with
those
except
as
to
voluntariness?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
are
other
historical
facts
that
you
find
by
drawing
inferences
from
other
historical
facts.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
those
would
be...
you
are
bound
by
those
findings.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
well,
do
you
think
that...
do
you
think
would
it
be
proper
to
say
that
great
weight
is
to
be
accorded
to
the
inferences
which
are
drawn
by
the
state
courts?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
dubious
cases,
it
is
appropriate
that
the
state
court's
determination
should
control?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i
mean
talking
about
the
ultimate
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
about
the
ultimate
conclusion
about
voluntariness.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
doubtful
cases
the
court
should
make
its
own...
make
up
its
own
mind
and
not
defer,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
i'm
reading
from
justice
frankfurter,
isn't
it
in
culombe?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
disagree
with
that,
with
what
he
said.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
great
weight
should
be
accorded
to
the
inferences
which
are
drawn
by
the
state
courts.
now,
he's
talking
about
the
inference
of
voluntariness
or
not,
the
state
of
mind.
and
in
dubious
cases,
the
state
court's
determination
should
control.
i
don't
think
your...
i
think
that's
a
little
bit
different
from
your
position.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
they
find
that
there
was
some?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
are
these
the
findings,
somebody's
findings
that
you
are
just
reading,
or
is
that
your
version
of
the
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
it
is
talking
about
facts.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
the
statute
itself
says
factual
findings
will
be
used.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
isn't
what
some
of
the
other
cases.
justice
byron
r.
white
some
of
the
older
cases.
or
that
isn't
what
that
is
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about,
what
about,
what
about
culombe?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
what
did
he
say
about
voluntariness,
the
inference
of
voluntariness?
he
said
it
was
a...
he
didn't
say
it
was
a
question
of
fact.
he
said
it
was
something
that
the
court
may
review.
