all
right.
well,
if
you
accept
it,
i'm
glad
to
know
it.
mr.
klein,
many
of
the
early
cases
holding
that
federal
courts
were
free
to
disregard
state
court
voluntariness
findings
seemed
to
be
based
on
some
kind
of
distrust
of
state
court
findings
in
general.
do
you
think
those
conditions
are
appropriate
today,
or
do
you
think
this
court
has
backed
away
from
that
view
of
distrusting
state
court
findings
in
general?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
that
a
federal
habeas
court
in
any
event
could
declare
certain
interrogation
tactics
improper
as
a
matter
of
law
or
define
that
the
voluntariness
finding
is
not
fairly
supported
by
the
record.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
aren't
those
sufficient
in
the
way
of
protections
today?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
of
course,
there
are
precedents
going
the
other
way
in
connection
with
this
specific
question
here
of
voluntariness
of
confessions,
are
there
not,
holding
that
it's
a
matter
for
review
by
the
federal
court
without
the
presumption
of
correctness?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
about
mincey
v.
arizona
where
the
court
said,
the
court
is
under
a
duty
to
make
an
independent
review
of
the
record?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
makes
a
difference
on
the
characterization
of
whether
it's
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law,
how
it
comes
up?
don't
you
think
that
determination
would
be
the
same
under
either
one
of
those?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that
isn't
what
the
court
said.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
davis
was
decided
a
few
months
before
section
2254
was
signed
into
law,
wasn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
condone
the
conduct
of
the
officers
in
this
interrogation
in
using
what
might
be
characterized
as
false
information
or
suggestions?
