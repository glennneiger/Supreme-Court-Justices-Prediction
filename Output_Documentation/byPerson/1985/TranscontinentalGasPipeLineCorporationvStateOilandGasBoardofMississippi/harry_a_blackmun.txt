mr.
taylor,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
arguing
fair
share,
not
conservation
at
all.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
may
deem
that
conservation,
but
it
doesn't
sound
like
the
mississippi
supreme
court
thought
that,
what
conservation
was.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
is
only
drainage
as
among
owners,
not
drainage
which
would
result
in
waste.
