mr.
john
marshall
grower
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
transcontinental
gas
pipe
line
corporation,
which
i
will
call
transco,
is
an
interstate
pipe
line
company
regulated
by
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission.
it
purchases
gas
in
the
states
of
mississippi,
louisiana,
texas
and
off-shore.
it
transports
that
gas
for
resale
in
markets
stretching
from
alabama
to
new
york.
for
many
years
prior
to
the
spring
of
1982,
this
interstate
company,
along
with
many
other
interstate
purchasers,
were
purchasing
gas
at
a
period
of
time
when
there
was
a
severe
shortage.
they
were
able
to
take
all
of
the
gas
that
their
contract
producers
could
deliver
to
them.
their
contracts
provided
that
they
could
do
so.
the
contracts
did
not
obligate
them
to
take
all
of
that
gas,
it
only
obligated
them
to
take
a
certain
minimum.
these
long-term
contracts
were
part
of
the
regulatory
scheme.
these
contracts
provided
for
minimum-take
obligations
and
take
or
pay
obligations
if
those
minimum
takes
were
not
made.
however,
in
the
spring,
particularly
may
of
1982,
it
became
apparent
to
the
gas
industry
as
a
whole
particularly
that
there
was
becoming
a
surplus
of
deliverability
of
gas.
there
was
a
loss
of
market
for
a
number
of
reasons
that
i
will
not
take
my
time
here,
the
drop
in
the
price
of
oil,
surplus
oil,
for
many
reasons.
but,
there
was
an
unprecedented,
an
unforeseeable
loss
in
the
markets
for
natural
gas.
that
created
a
problem
whereby
the
interstate
pipe
line
companies,
and
transco
in
this
case,
could
not
then
purchase
all
of
the
gas
that
was
required
to
be
purchased
under
its
contracts.
mr.
john
marshall
grower
that
is
exactly
right,
your
honor.
they
could
not
sell
it.
mr.
john
marshall
grower
the
pipe
line
is
not
the
market.
the
pipe
line
is
the
conduit
to
the
market
and
if
the
market
can't
take
it,
they
can't
buy
it.
it
is
that
simple.
now,
when
they
were
unable
to
buy
all
of
their
contracted
gas,
they
had
to
cease
buying
gas
from
owners
that
they
had
no
obligation
to
purchase
the
gas
from.
now,
these
owners
in
east
morgantown
and
greens
creek
field
areas
of
mississippi,
coastal
and
others,
had
chosen
not
to
commit
their
gas
to
contract.
in
1978,
'79
and
'80,
when
the
long-term
contracts
in
this
field
were
made
with
getty,
harkins,
florida
gas,
and
others
by
transco,
of
course,
there
was
a
shortage
and
these
particular
producers
chose
not
to
commit
their
gas
to
contract.
all
indications
were
that
for
the
foreseeable
future
prices
were
going
to
continue
increasing,
oil
prices
were
going
up,
the
market
was
going
to
expand,
everything
look
rosy.
there
was
no
need
to
commit
their
gas
they
thought.
i
assume
they
thought
that.
they
didn't.
so,
in
essence,
when
the
axe
dropped
and
they
were
no
longer
able
to
sell
their
gas
to
transco
at
the
high
prices
being
received
by
the
contract
producers
under
those
1979
and
'80
contracts,
they
sought
relief
from
the
mississippi
oil
&
gas
board
pursuant
to
rule
48
of
the
board
which
required
the
ratable
taking
of
gas
from
the
state
of
mississippi.
it
was
a
state-wide
rule.
the
board
enforced
that
rule.
the
board
required
transco
to
take
the
non-contract
gas
and
to
take
it
without
discrimination.
the
impact,
the
consequence
of
that
order
was
to
displace
contract
purchasers,
because,
as
we
said
in
the
beginning,
the
market
is
limited,
they
cannot
take
any
more
than
the
market
could
take,
so
if
they
are
required
to
take
non-contract
gas,
they
have
got
to
cut
back
on
taking
some
contract
gas,
the
effect
of
the
order.
mr.
john
marshall
grower
the
effect
of
the
order,
justice
o'connor,
was
to
increase...
take
or
pay
payment
for
one
thing.
i
will
explain
that.
in
that
the
contracts
required
a
certain
minimum
take.
mr.
john
marshall
grower
the
effect
of
it
was
to
ultimately
require
the
taking
of
more
gas.
that
was
the
practical
effect.
because
of
the
take
or
pay
requirement...
this
is
complicated
and
difficult
for
me
to
explain.
i
know
it
is
not
difficult
for
you
to
understand,
but
these
contracts
require
take
or
pay
which
in
essence
the
cost
of
making
take
or
pay
payments
are
a
flow
through
to
the
consumer.
it
increases
the
cost.
but,
that
take
or
pay
may
be
recouped
in
a
five-year
period.
and,
if
that
gas
can
be
recouped,
it
is
only
recouped
out
of
the
excess
above
the
minimum
take.
so,
we
are
either
going
to
pay
for
the
gas
twice
if
we
can't
recoup
it
or
when
we
are
catching
up
and
producing
above
the
minimum
we
are
going
to
have
to
produce
more
gas
from
that
contract
while
at
the
same
time
producing
the
non-contract
gas
that
the
state
requires
us
to
take.
mr.
john
marshall
grower
your
honor,
we
know
what
it
would
cost
from
this
standpoint.
the
take
or
pay
payments
under
the
high-cost
contracts...
those
contracts
at
this
time
were
$7.90.
so,
when
you
have
to
pay
for
gas
you
can't
take
at
$7.90,
that
increased
cost
increases
substantially.
mr.
john
marshall
grower
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
john
marshall
grower
that
is
right,
your
honor.
but,
transco
did
not
want
to
take
this
gas
at
all.
its
market
could
not
take
this
gas
without
increasing
its
obligations
under
its
contract.
that
is
the
main
problem.
mr.
john
marshall
grower
take
or
pay
obligation
is...
for
instance,
in
these
contracts
that
were
made
after
the
ngpa
when
there
was
a
severe
shortage
in
the
pipe
lines
needed
gas
supply,
under
their
contract
made
in
that
context,
they
were
required
to
purchase
from
85
to
90
percent
of
the
deliverability
of
those
wells
and
if
they
did
not
purchase
85
or
90
percent,
whichever
the
figure
was
in
the
contract,
they
would
then
have
to
pay...
in
a
particular
year,
they
would
then
have
to
pay
for
the
gas
not
taken
in
addition
to
the
gas
taken.
now,
that
take
or
pay
gas,
it
is
paid
for,
then
may
be
recouped
within
the
next
five
years,
but
it
can
only
be
recouped
out
of
the
10
or
15
percent
excess
above
the
85
or
90
percent
that
is
available
to
recoupment,
because
you
still
have
the
minimum
requirement
to
take
90
percent.
mr.
john
marshall
grower
only
by
taking
more
than
85
percent.
now,
the
problem
now
is
that
under
today's
market
conditions,
where
the
market
cannot
take
that
gas,
they
are
incurring
additional
take
or
pay
problems
that
are
so
severe
that
there
is
no
way
that
they
can
catch
up
out
of
that
10
or
15
percent.
mr.
john
marshall
grower
well,
it
has
gotten
worse,
it
has
gotten
worse.
the
take
or
pay
problems
today
are
much
greater
than
they
were
then.
they
were
just
starting
then.
today...
in
this
case,
we
are
talking
about
$50
million
to
$70
million
incurred
at
that
time,
a
short
period
of
time.
today
it
is
in
the
billions.
mr.
john
marshall
grower
all
right.
the
pipe
lines
are
incurring
these
take
or
pay
obligations
to
producers
for
gas
it
cannot
take.
mr.
john
marshall
grower
because
of
the
unprecedented
and
unforeseeable
drop
in
the
market.
mr.
john
marshall
grower
that
is
correct.
a
serious
drop
in
demand,
i
might
say.
the
problem
is
exacerbated
by
the
fact
that
the
more
the
market
drops
under
the
regulatory
scheme
and
the
take
or
pay
obligation
is
incurred
and
if
those
costs
are
added,
you
are
increasing
the
cost,
you
are
losing
more
market
and
you
just
have
the--
mr.
john
marshall
grower
--yes,
sir,
i
hope
to
and
i
think
the
main
trouble
with
the
order
is--
mr.
john
marshall
grower
--thank
you.
mr.
john
marshall
grower
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
order
in
this
case
by
the
state
oil
and
gas
board
of
mississippi
requiring
the
purchase
of
non-contract
gas
at
any
cost
directly
impacts
on
the
cost
of
service
of
the
pipe
line.
also,
the
order
which
requires
additional
take
or
pay
increases
the
cost
of
the
gas
to
the
consumer
which
is
a
direct
impact
on
the
cost
of
service
also.
these
matters
have
been
condemned
by
this
court,
particularly
in
northern
natural
versus
the
state
corporation
commission
of
kansas
in
1963.
it
is
almost
an
identical
case.
the
question
today
is--
mr.
john
marshall
grower
--no,
sir.
mr.
john
marshall
grower
it
was
a
ratable
take
order
exactly
like
this
one,
northern
natural
versus
state
corporation
commission
of
kansas.
mr.
john
marshall
grower
the
difference,
your
honor,
today
is
and
the
issue
raised
today
is
whether
or
not
the
natural
gas
policy
act
has
changed
the
jurisdiction
so
that
the
state
may
now
enter
this
field
and
regulate
the
interstate
pipe
line.
mr.
john
marshall
grower
well,
it
interfered
with
the
cost
of
service
of
the
pipe
line.
mr.
john
marshall
grower
it
pre-empted
the--
mr.
john
marshall
grower
--right.
the
pervasive
and
comprehensive
regulation
under
the
natural
gas
act
and
the
natural
gas
policy
act
today
simply
sweeps
the
field
clean.
there
is
no
room
left
for
state
regulations.
the
natural
gas
policy
act
didn't
change
that.
mr.
john
marshall
grower
justice
o'connor,
it
deregulated--
mr.
john
marshall
grower
--well,
in
the
first
place,
it
conflicts
with...
the
state
order
here
conflicts
with
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
to
regulate
the
cost
structures
of
the
pipe
line
company
which--
mr.
john
marshall
grower
--the
price
of
the
gas
at
the
well
head
was
deregulated,
but
my
point,
your
honor,
is
that
any
price
that
the
company
is
required
to
purchase
this
gas
affects
its
cost
structures
which
has
been
held
by
this
court
on
several
occasions,
and
recently
in
maryland
versus
louisiana
and
exxon
versus
eagerton,
that
that
regulation
of
the
cost
structures
of
the
interstate
pipe
line
is
the
exclusive
domain
of
the
ferc.
mr.
john
marshall
grower
well,
intrastate
gas
is
not
sold
in
interstate
commerce.
it
does
not
impact
on
the
interstate
price.
mr.
john
marshall
grower
well,
the
ngpa
has
given
the
states
the
right
to
establish
lesser
prices
for
intrastate
gas
than
the
maximum
price
allowed
by
the
nga.
that
is
the
only
jurisdiction
that
has
been
given
and
very
well
state
regulations
of
intrastate
that
would
conflict
with
that
might
be
pre-empted.
of
course,
that
is
not
the
issue
here,
if
the
court
please,
and
i
have
not
looked
at
that
point.
mr.
john
marshall
grower
the--
--mississippi
rule,
i
am
sorry.
mississippi
rule.
your
honor,
yes,
because,
as
i
say,
the
regulation
which
requires
the
company
to
purchase
non-contract
gas
at
any
cost
impacts
directly
on
the
cost
of
service
of
this
pipe
line.
the
price
of
the
gas
is
a
direct
cost
of
service
that
flows
through
subject
to
the
ferc
regulations.
mr.
john
marshall
grower
it
is
not
critical,
but
it
is
the
point
that
was
the
focus
in
the
northern
natural
case,
because
in
the
northern
natural
case
take
or
pay
was
indicated
to
be
one
of
the
problems
of
conflict
that
could
occur
where
it
increased
the
price
to
the
consumer
and
affected
the
cost
of
service.
i
would
like
to
take
some
additional
time
for
rebuttal,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
john
marshall
grower
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
am
afraid
i
do.
there
are
a
number
of
matters
that
i
would
like
to
address,
but
i
will
try
to
address
a
few
of
them.
let's
first
take
the
statement
that
mississippi
has
not
required
transco
to
purchase
any
gas.
what
kind
of
choice
is
that?
we
have
got
contracts
that
require
to
take
a
minimum
quantity
of
gas
pursuant
to
the
regulatory
scheme
under
the
nga
and
the
ngpa.
we
have
got
that
gas
to
purchase
to
supply
our
customers'
needs.
that
is
part
of
the
federal
regulatory
scheme.
all
right.
we
don't
have
to
buy
that
gas
because
of
the
state
of
mississippi.
mr.
john
marshall
grower
justice
o'connor,
the
take
or
pay
contract
has
been
a
part
of
the
regulatory
scheme
for
almost
50
years,
since
1938
when
the
nga
came
into
effect.
the
contractual
relationship
between
the
producer
and
the
pipe
line's
customer
have
been
a
part
of
this
regulatory
scheme.
the
pipe
line
must
contract
for
supplies
of
gas.
they
are
required
by
federal
regulation
to
enter
these
contracts.
mr.
john
marshall
grower
your
honor,
that
is
correct,
but
at
the
time
these
contracts
were
entered
into
it
was
still
part
of
the
regulatory
scheme
recognized
by
the
ferc
and
they
had
regulations
dealing
with
the
manner
in
which
take
or
pay,
the
costs
were
passed
on
to
the
consumer.
mr.
john
marshall
grower
well,
if
these
contracts
had
no
take
or
pay
obligation,
then
there
would
be
nothing
to
prevent
the
pipe
line,
if
they
had
no
minimum
take
requirements...
you
also
may
have
minimum
take
requirements
which
require
you
to
buy
a
certain
amount
of
gas
or
pay
for
it,
period,
with
no
right
to
ever
recoup
it.
but,
if
there
are
no
minimum
take
requirements,
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
the
pipe
lines
from
purchasing
all
of
the
gas
because
they
don't
have
to
take
it.
mr.
john
marshall
grower
well,
if
the
court
please,
the
take
or
pay
problem
today
has
been
made
a
serious
problem
because
of
the
extreme
prices
we
have
in
the
market.
mr.
john
marshall
grower
yes,
sir,
i
am.
and,
the
fact
that
there
could
have
been
contracts
without
take
or
pay,
i
just
can't
answer
that
directly,
because
there
are
contracts
for
take
or
pay
and
they
were
a
part
of
the
regulatory
scheme
and
if
there
were
no
contracts
with
take
or
pay,
then
there
would
be
nothing
to
prevent
the
pipe
lines
from
purchasing
this,
because
it
would
not
increase
their
cost.
mr.
john
marshall
grower
well,
yes.
there
is
not
a
requirement
under
the
federal
government,
but
it
has
been
part
of
the
regulatory
scheme
because--
mr.
john
marshall
grower
--it
has
been
recognized
as
part
of
the
regulatory
scheme
because
the
producers
wanted
to
be
assured
that
they
would
have
a
share
of
the
market.
mr.
john
marshall
grower
it
was
permitted
because
the
producers
wanted
a
share
of
the
market
and
there
would
be
no
reason
for
a
producer
to
enter
into
a
contract
without
some
minimum
take
obligations
because
they
would
never
have
any
assurance
that
the
gas
would
ever
be
produced.
it
was
a
necessary
part
of
the
contractual
process
and
because
it
was
necessary
it
was
recognized
in
the
federal
scheme.
mr.
john
marshall
grower
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
marshall
grower
it
removes
the
price
regulations.
mr.
john
marshall
grower
it
removes
the
price
regulation,
but
it
does
not
remove
the
regulation
over
the
pipe
line
concerning
the
transportation
and
resale
of
that
gas
in
interstate
commerce
and
this
was
made
clear,
if
the
court
please,
in
mid-louisiana
by
justice
stevens.
mr.
john
marshall
grower
as
to
price.
i
agree
with
that
as
to
price.
mr.
john
marshall
grower
it
changed--
mr.
john
marshall
grower
--yes,
sir.
mr.
john
marshall
grower
yes,
sir,
and
that
has
been
so
held.
mr.
john
marshall
grower
no,
sir.
mr.

no,
sir.
mr.
john
marshall
grower
the
state
still
controls
that
because
they
control
what
can
be
produced
by
these
wells.
it
is
only
being
drained
because
the
state
is
permitting
the
producers
to
produce
the
gas.
mr.
john
marshall
grower
transco
does
not
determine
how
much
gas
is
delivered
to
it.
it
limits
how
much
it
can
take.
but,
as
to
the
amount,
that
is
regulated
by
the
state
as
to
what
can
legally
be
produced.
now,
the
regulation...
ratable
take
also
implies
and
includes
ratable
production.
the
state
can
have
jurisdiction
and
regulate
production
from
the
wells
over
the
producer
and
this
is
what
was
said
in
northern
natural;
that
you
can
require
the
producers
to
produce
ratably
and
to
share
the
market.
this
is
the
concept,
if
the
court
please,
of
the
market
demand
allocation.
you
are
requiring
the
producers
with
the
market
to
share
their
market
and
you
are
limiting
their
production
to
their
share
of
the
market.
thereby,
you
are
eliminating
the
take
or
pay
problem.
by
requiring
the
producer
to
share
the
market
and
to
produce
only
their
share
of
the
market,
you
are
taking
care
of
the
problems.
pipe
line
doesn't
regulate
how
much
can
be
produced
by
the
state.
mr.
john
marshall
grower
yes.
i
am
sorry.
mr.
john
marshall
grower
no,
sir,
because
there
is
no
regulation
that
deals
with
that,
because,
in
the
first
place,
i
take
issue
with
the
premise
that
transco
is
draining,
because
the
producer
is
draining.
the
producer
gets
the
gas,
the
producer
gets
the
money.
transco
is
merely
purchasing
it.
they
could
take
the
same
gas
and
the
state
could
require
that
producer
to
share
that
market
and
to
pay
those
proceeds
to
these
other
producers.
i
mean,
that
is
a
state
function.
that
is
regulation
over
the
production
and
gathering
of
gas
that
has
been
traditional
regulation
that
nobody
contests
the
state
has
a
right
to.
mr.
john
marshall
grower
thank
you.
