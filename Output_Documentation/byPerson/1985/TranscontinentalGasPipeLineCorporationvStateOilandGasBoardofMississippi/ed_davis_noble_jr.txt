mr.
ed
davis
noble,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
my
purpose
is
to
explain
what
the
legitimate
state
interest
of
the
state
of
mississippi
is
with
its
rule
48.
we
believe
that
it
encourages
the
development
of
its
natural
gas
by
protecting
the
correlative
interest
of
each
owner,
operator,
and
producer
in
a
particular
pool,
but
more
importantly,
rule
48
also
satisfies
the
statutory
requirement
that
the
oil
and
gas
board
at
least
attempt
to
conserve
the
natural
gas
in
the
state
of
mississippi;
that
is
to
prevent
drainage
as
it
has
been
defined
by
co-counsel,
waste
and
reservoir
damage
caused
by
unratable
and
disproportionate
withdrawals
of
gas.
the
requirements
of
rule
48,
in
effect,
are
practical
and
consistent
with
the
congressional
goals
of
the
ngpa.
and,
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
it
encourages
the
participation
of
all
the
owners,
operators,
or
producers
in
a
particular
field
and
encourages
them
to
develop
the
state's
natural
resources
by
permitting
just
compensation
for
their
efforts
in
the
development
at
a
fair
and
current
price.
now,
if
the
primary
objective
of
the
ngpa
is
to
increase
the
supply
of
natural
gas
in
intrastate,
then
we
say
that
48
is
consistent
with
the
federal
program.
that
is
because
it
corrects
what
could
be
a
potential
market
failure
in
the
sales
of
gas
at
the
well
head
in
mississippi.
that
can
occur
when
you
see
a
situation
which
we
have
and
that
is
very
few
purchasers
in
a
field
where
there
are
multiple
owners,
operators,
and
producers,
thereby
creating
a
market
situation
of
perhaps
less
production
and
lower
prices
offered
than
would
be
in
a
perfectly
competitive
market.
further,
the
producer
would
be
without
a
purchaser
and,
therefore,
would
suffer
a
risk
under
the
rule
of
capture
which
exists
in
oil
and
gas
and
that
is
he
would
see
his
property
extracted
without
compensation,
and,
therefore,
it
would
conflict
with
the
rule
and
the
law
of
correlative
rights.
as
this
court
is
aware,
ngpa
makes
no
provision
for
the
protection
of
the
small,
independent,
non-contracting
owners.
well,
rule
48
provides
for
that
such
protection.
it
does
so
merely
because
it
provides
that
if
you
participate
and
if
you
do
purchase
the
rule
only
says
that
you
must
at
least
offer,
no
more
than
offer,
to
purchase
the
gas
at
a
reasonable
or
current
price.
now,
if--
mr.
ed
davis
noble,
jr.
--that
is
if
there
is
no
contract,
that
is
correct,
justice
rehnquist.
let
us
assume
that
that
particular
owner,
operator,
or
producer
refuses,
what
can
he
do?
then
he
merely
runs
the
risk
of
being
able
to
recover
his
property;
that
is
his
oil
or
natural
gas
that
he
owns
at
a
later
date.
rule
48
merely
gives
him
the
opportunity
or
protection
of
being
able
to
recover
during
the
purchase
time
at
a
fair
rate.
if
the
producer
is
not
permitted
to
purchase
and
to
sell
and
to
get
his
fair
market
price
at
the
time
in
which
the
pipe
line
does,
in
fact,
purchase,
then
there
is
a
possibility
that
since
he
will
not
be
compensated,
then
he
would
seek
other
markets
in
intrastate,
thereby
defeating
the
purpose
of
ngpa
by
reducing
by
whatever
means
the
particular
oil
and
gas
which
might
flow
into
intrastate.
the
state
of
mississippi
does
not
mandate
taking
by
strict
allowables
or
production.
it
is
that
the
oil
and
gas
board
sets
maximum
allowables
for
a
specific
period
of
time
which
means
that
if
you
do
produce
in
the
state
of
mississippi
you
can
take
anywhere
from
the
well
being
shut
in,
that
is
zero,
to
the
maximum
allowable
with
would
be
100
percent.
we
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
in
doing
so
we
have,
in
effect,
a
market.
the
producer
is
ready
to
surrender
his
gas
to
the
pipe
line.
the
pipe
line
determines
what
it
wishes
to
take
and
if
it
takes
within
the
allowables
according
to
state
law
in
a
particular
field,
it
may
take
from
zero
to
100
during
that
period
of
time.
so,
we
suggest--
mr.
ed
davis
noble,
jr.
--no,
sir.
mr.
ed
davis
noble,
jr.
that
is
right.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
so
long
as
the
state
is
assured
that
that
person
will
receive
his
fair
market
price,
we
do
not...
the
state
of
mississippi
does
not
interfere
in
negotiations
for
what
the
price
may
be.
mr.
ed
davis
noble,
jr.
if
there
is
no
contract,
there
is
no
take
or
pay.
mr.
ed
davis
noble,
jr.
no,
sir.
as
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
mississippi
said,
at
least
that
person
should
be
assured
of
a
fair
market
price
for
his
gas.
in
other
words,
at
least,
if
the
fair
market
price
will
not
interfere
with
commerce
or
will
not
interfere
with
ferc...
will
not
come
into
play
with
ferc,
because
all
we
are
addressing
is
either
market
price
or
fair
market
price
or
below.
mr.
ed
davis
noble,
jr.
it
did,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
ed
davis
noble,
jr.
that
is
correct,
sir.
in
allowing
for
a
fair
market
price
and
creating
a
market
in
interstate
commerce,
we
would
also
suggest
that
rule
48
protects
the
consumer.
that
is
all
it
says
is
that
the
owner,
operator,
or
producer
will
have
its
opportunity
to
be
compensated
and
that
there
is
no
incidental
hinderance
to
the
market
place
because
if,
in
fact,
the
end
result
of
more
production,
more
gas,
will,
in
essence,
create
a
market
where
there
is
by
supply
a
lesser
price
at
the
well
head
to
be
paid
by
the
consumer.
i
would
like
to
address
another
question
posed
by
justice
o'connor
and
that
is
what,
if
anything,
would
be
the
standard
which
might
be
or
could
be
applied
by
the
state
of
mississippi
or
what
should
be
applied?
we
would
suggest
that
the
rule
of
the
state
of
mississippi
is
a
fair
one
and
is
constitutional.
the
import
of
ngpa
is
that
there
at
least
be
a
competitive
market
at
the
well
head
and
it
suggests
that
the
mississippi
ratable
take
is
a
policy
which
is
carefully
calculated
to
reflect
competitive
markets.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
this
rule
or
any
other
rule
would
be
a
minimum
interference
with
the
participants
at
the
market
and
particularly
so
that
it
would
not
injure
the
consumer
or
the
public
interest.
if
there
are
no
questions
from
the
court,
thank
you
very
much.
