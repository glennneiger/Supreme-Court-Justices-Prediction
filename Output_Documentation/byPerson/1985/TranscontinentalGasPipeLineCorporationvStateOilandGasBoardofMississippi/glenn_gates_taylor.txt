mr.
glenn
gates
taylor
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
before
coming
to
my
submission,
i
would
like
to
address
the
question
that
your
honor
raised
about
take
or
pay
payments.
take
or
pay
payments
are
refundable
pre-payments
for
gas.
a
fundamental
assumption
is
that
during
the
period
of
a
20-year
contract
that
there
will
be
significant
periods
of
time
during
which
a
purchaser
will
not
need
all
of
the
gas
that
the
producer
can
deliver,
but
at
the
same
time
the
producer
needs
some
sort
of
cash
flow.
so,
if
and
where
and
the
parties
agree,
they
agree
to
include
a
take
or
pay
provision
which
provides
that
if
you
get
to
the
end
of
a
contract
year
and
the
pipe
line
has
not
taken
all
of
the
minimum
quantity
that
it
agreed
to,
it
will
pre-pay
for
the
balance
and
it
will
recover
it
either
in
kind
or
in
cash
under
cash
balance.
if,
at
the
time
the
take
or
pay
obligation
is
called
for,
they
cannot
make
up
the
gas,
if
they
are
being
called
to
pre-pay
for,
then
they
have
a
contractual
defense.
now,
as
interesting
as
all
that
is,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
what
the
state
has
required
in
this
case.
forget
the
exaggerations
that
have
been
made
about
what
the
state
of
mississippi
has
required
and
look
at
pages
14
and
15
of
our
brief
and
how
our
mississippi
supreme
court
has
construed
this
requirement.
the
requirement
is
not
that
a
pipe
line
has
to
take
the
first
mcf
of
gas.
it
is
that
the
pipe
line
when
and
if...
this
is
on
14
and
15
of
our
brief...
when
and
if
a
pipe
line
decides
to
take
gas
from
a
pool,
then
whatever
quantity
it
wants
to
take,
it
must
offer
to
take
those
quantities
ratably
as
among
the
different
wells
in
the
pool
so
they
are
not
taking
100
percent
out
of
one
well
and
10
percent
out
of
another
one,
which
is
virtually
the
example
we
had
in
this
case,
and
they
must
offer
to
pay
a
market
price
unless
the
parties
agree
otherwise.
the
parties
are
free
to
agree
to
two
cents,
two
dollars,
or
twenty
dollars.
but,
in
the
absence
of
that
agreement,
if
somebody
wants
their
gas
taken
so
that
no
drainage
occurs,
the
state
is
not
going
to
allow
drainage
to
occur
simply
because
somebody
is
being
obstinate
about
the
price
that
ought
to
be
paid.
they
called
for
a
market-responsive
price.
and,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
transco
has
been
complying
with
this
by
offering
a
market-out
clause
price
since
december
of
1982.
now,
let
me
get
to
the
issue
which
is
pre-emption.
we
submit
that
under
section
601(a)
of
the
ngpa
congress
clearly
eliminated
ferc's
section
1(b)
jurisdiction
over
wholesales
of
deregulated
natural
gas
in
interstate
commerce.
consequently,
the
states
are
once
again
free
to
attach
a
reasonable
ratable
take
requirement
to
any
purchaser's
takes
of
deregulated
gas.
i
want
to
explain
why
mississippi's
requirement
is
not
pre-empted.
i
want
to
explain
the
inconsistency
of
ferc's
position
in
this
case
and
why
producers
need
this
simple
protection.
it
is
a
question
of
implied
pre-emption.
no
one
claims
that
this
state
power,
ratable
take
power,
is
pre-empted
by
congress.
ferc...
it
is
briefed
on
page
15...
concedes
that
point.
it
is
a
question
of
implied
pre-emption;
that
is
in
passing
the
ngpa
did
congress
intend
to
prohibit
the
state
from
attaching
reasonable
conservation
requirements
to
takes
of
deregulated
gas
or
did
congress
intend
to
create
a
gap
into
which
the
states
could
not
step
with
their
conservation
powers.
we
submit
that
congress
didn't
either.
first,
look
at
the
legislative
history
and
look
at
the
act
itself.
congress
intended
that
the
states
would
play
a
major
role
in
what
was
the
overriding
objective
of
congress
to
increase
the
supply
of
natural
gas
available
to
the
interstate
commerce
and
end
the
perpetual
shortages
of
gas
in
that
market.
congress
vested
the
states
with
broad
powers
under
section
503
to
make
these
fundamental
determinations
that
would
determine
what
price
you
got
if
it
was
regulated
gas
or
whether
it
was
going
to
be
deregulated
gas.
as
importantly,
the
legislative
history
reflects
that
the
<ngpa>
[=
ngpa]
was
not
to
intrude
on
the
states'
historical
conservation
powers
or
their
traditional
conservation
functions.
mr.
glenn
gates
taylor
no,
your
honor.
mr.
glenn
gates
taylor
the
unfairness
was
that
because
of
these
discriminatory
takes
drainage
would
result.
the
concept
of
drainage
is
a
concept
of
fair
share;
that
the
owners
in
a
pool
must
have
an
opportunity
to
get
their
fair
share
of
gas.
mr.
glenn
gates
taylor
no,
your
honor,
they
did
not.
they
explained
that
the
overriding
purpose
is
fairness.
they
cited
shell
oil
versus
james,
which
is
a
drainage
case.
i
mean,
drainage
is
wrapped
up
in
the
fairness
issue.
in
order
to
breathe
life
into
an
owner's
opportunity
to
recover
his
fair
share,
he
must
have
the
mere
opportunity
to
get
into
the
market
at
the
well
head.
i
was
going
to
point
out
that
in
the
legislative
history
congressman
dingell
in
submitting
the
ngpa
to
the
house
made
this
statement
on
october
14,
1978.
he
said
that
the
legislation
does
not
contemplate
that
ferc
will
intrude
into
the
traditional
conservation
functions
performed
by
the
states.
this
is
a
matter
reserved
to
the
state
agencies.
during
the
exercise
of
their
historical
power
will
continue
to
regulate
such
matters
and
he
goes
on
to
say
such
as
drilling
locations,
completion
techniques,
production
rates,
etcetera.
he
could
have
just
as
easily
said
such
as
ratable
take
orders
which
this
court
in
the
phillips
case,
in
the
northern
natural
case
pointed
out.
ratable
take
orders
have
always
been
part
of
the
states'
historical
powers.
mr.
glenn
gates
taylor
yes,
sir.
and,
if
you
go
on--
mr.
glenn
gates
taylor
--yes,
sir.
if
you
go
to
the
last
four
pages
of
the
supreme
court's
opinion...
i
am
referring
to
the
southern
citation...
if
you
go
to
those
last
four
pages
in
which
they
are
construing
the
purpose
and
objective
and
power
of
the
oil
and
gas
board
under
rule
48,
it
is
designed
to
prevent
drainage
and
to
insure
fairness
of
correlative
rights
because
it
is
fundamentally
unfair
for
ratable
takes
to
occur
and
a
purchaser
to
take
indirectly
what
he
will
not
take
directly.
mr.
glenn
gates
taylor
absolutely
it
is
a
conservation
concern
for
this
reason.
mr.
glenn
gates
taylor
your
honor,
we
are.
as
we
explain
at
pages
six
through
ten
of
our
brief,
the
legitimate
state
interest
involved,
drainage
is
a
phenomenon
of
life.
judge
robertson
in
the
supreme
court's
opinion
pointed
that
out.
in
order
to
breathe
meaning
into
the
opportunity
of
someone
to
recover
their
fair
share
of
production,
they
cannot
bag
it,
they
cannot
store
it,
they
cannot
wait
to
get
their
one
percent
until
99
percent
has
been
produced.
they
must
have
an
opportunity
to
take
when
others
take
and
to
sell
when
others
sell.
so,
i
respectfully
would
have
to
disagree
that
the
purpose
of
this
rule
is
to
insure
fairness
in
the
sense
that
it
is
unfair
to
deny
and
deprive
owners
possessed
of
correlative
rights
the
opportunity
to
recover
their
fair
share.
secondly,
no
gap
was
intended
by
congress
in
passing
the
ngpa.
mr.
glenn
gates
taylor
they
are
part
and
parcel
of
the
same
thing.
fair
share
is
conservation.
if
you
look
at
mississippi
code,
section
5311
which
is
the
preamble
to
the
conservation
act,
it
says
that
it
is
the
purpose
and
intent
of
this
act
to
insure
and
afford
the
opportunity
of
each
owner
in
a
common
source
of
supply
the
opportunity
to
recover
his
fair
share.
mr.
glenn
gates
taylor
your
honor,
they
did.
conservation
is...
part
and
parcel
of
conservation
is
preventing
drainage,
preventing
unratable
takes,
preventing
reservoir
damage.
the
purpose
of
this
rule
is
to
allow
each
owner
the
mere
opportunity
to
recover
his
fair
share
so
this
is
not--
mr.
glenn
gates
taylor
--but,
if
you
don't--
mr.
glenn
gates
taylor
--i
don't
disagree
with
that
but
you
have
got
to
read
the
tail
end
of
the
opinion
in
which...
first,
they
consider
the
constitutional
questions,
then
they
move
to
the
legitimate
state
interest
in
connection
with
the
commerce
clause
and
there
is
no
way
to
separate...
waste
is
defined
under
mississippi
law
as
the
non-ratable
or
disproportionate
taking
of
gas
so
as
to
cause
drainage.
if
you
get
down
to
the
point
in
the
opinion
in
which
judge
robertson
says
we
regard
fairness
as
one
of
the
more
noble
attributes
of
this
rule.
he
cites
shell
oil
company
versus
james
which
is
a
drainage
case
and
he
says
drainage
is
a
phenomenon
of
life
in
the
gas
pool.
it
must
be
prevented.
in
other
words,
the
purpose
of
the
conservation
act,
one
of
the
fundamental
purposes,
is
to
prevent
drainage
which
gets
me
back
to
my
gap
argument.
mr.
glenn
gates
taylor
no,
your
honor.
waste
is
defined
as
some
owners
recovering...
under
mississippi
law
some
owners
recovering
more
than
their
fair
share
because
of
non-ratable
disproportionate
takes
of
gas.
and,
it
is
this.
you
have
several
wells
in
a
pool.
in
this
case,
you
had
transco
taking
100
percent
from
the
florida
gas
wells
and
taking
40
percent
from
the
getty
wells
and
it
was
undisputed
in
the
record
that
drainage
was
occurring.
transco
was
taking
indirectly
by
way
of
drainage
what
they
refused
to
take
directly.
that
is
exactly
what
these
ratable
take
requirements
in
all
of
the
oil
and
gas
producing
states...
and
there
is
not
a
nickel's
worth
of
difference
between
that
fundamental
requirement,
whether
it
is
in
colorado,
whether
it
is
in
new
mexico,
whether
it
is
in
texas
or
whether
it
is
in
louisiana.
the
purpose
is
to
give
the
owners
in
the
pool
the
opportunity
to
recover
their
fair
share,
which
gets
me
back
to
the
no-gap
intended
argument
and
you
have
to
cross
the
attleboro
decision
in
covering
the
pre-emption
question
and
the
commerce
clause.
in
1938,
congress
wrote
into
law
this
court's
decision
in
the
attleboro
line
of
cases
which
was
that
because
of
the
commerce
clause
the
states
can't
regulate
these
wholesales.
congress
came
along
and
passed
the
natural
gas
act,
saying
because
the
states
can't
do
it
because
of
the
commerce
clause,
we
are
going
to
allow
the
federal
power
commission
to
do
it.
ironically,
after
the
natural
gas
act
was
passed
in
1938,
this
court
went
off
and
abandoned
that
line
of
cases.
and,
the
decision
from
a
couple
of
terms
ago
in
the
arkansas
electric
cooperative
case
makes
it
very
clear
that
the
attleboro
test
has
for
all
practical
purposes
been
abandoned,
the
pike
test
has
been
applied.
now,
we
take
that
back
to
the
ngpa.
in
other
words,
even
in
phillips,
this
court
acknowledged
that
after
attleboro
and
after
the
natural
gas
act
was
passed,
the
constitutional
restrictions
on
the
ability
of
the
states
to
regulate
activities
that
impacted
interstate
commerce
had
been
loosened.
it
was
recognized
in
phillips
and
a
perfect
example
is
the
peerless
case
in
which
this
court
upheld
the
ratable
take
minimum
price
order.
there
the
state
conservation
commission
fixed
the
price.
this
court
upheld
that
type
order
against
a
commerce
clause
challenge.
now,
bring
it
all
into
focus.
the
only
barrier
before
was
the
commerce
clause,
so
we
had
the
natural
gas
act,
section
1(b)
jurisdiction.
the
court
goes
off
and
adopts
the
new
pike
test.
we
then
come
down
the
ngpa
in
which
congress
eliminates
the
very
section
1(b)
jurisdiction
that
was
applied
in
phillips
which
leaves
us
only
with
the
commerce--
mr.
glenn
gates
taylor
--that
is
what
i
am
bringing
it
all
down
to.
you--
mr.
glenn
gates
taylor
--peerless
had
nothing
to
do
with
it.
peerless
is
an
example
of
a
court
having
abandoned
the
attleboro
test
and
applied
the
pike
test.
in
peerless
the
court
cited
south
carolina
versus
barnwell
and
that
line
of
cases
as
representing
the
more
modern
approach.
and,
if
you
look
at
pike,
that
is
the
same
test
that
the
court
has
applied
under
the
commerce
clause
and
that
is
exactly
my
point;
that
since
the
ngpa
eliminated
section
1(b)
jurisdiction
which
was
a
codification
of
attleboro,
since
they
eliminated
that,
there
is
no
statutory
pre-emption
question.
it
is
a
question
of
the
commerce
clause.
if
you
apply
the
commerce
clause
test
to
pike,
which,
under
another
name
it
was
applied
in
peerless,
this
simple
state
requirement
passes
that
test,
because
there
are
strong
interests
in
the
state
and
it
is
consistent
with
the
policy
of
congress
in
encouraging
more
producers
to
get
involved
in
the
process
of
drilling
more
wells,
discovering
new
gas,
and
offering
that
gas
and
making
it
available
for
sale
in
interstate
commerce.
that
is
all
this
rule
does.
it
goes
no
further.
let
me
turn
to
ferc's
conflict
claim
with
this
perspective
in
mind.
at
the
time
of
the
northern
natural
decision,
we
had
a
pervasive
scheme
of
federal
regulations.
producers
could
not
sell
into
interstate
commerce
without
ferc
authority.
pipe
lines
could
not
bid
for
gas,
there
were
no
deregulated
sales.
it
was
truly
regulated
from
the
well
head
to
the
burner
tip.
it
was
because
of
that...
the
court
in
northern
natural
cites
attleboro
and
they
rely
on
section
1(b).
they
rely
on
phillips.
they
say
because
of
that
pervasive
scheme
there
is
a
likelihood
or
an
imminent
possibility
of
collision.
if
you
go
back
to
northern
natural,
the
court
did
not
require
an
actual
conflict
be
shown.
the
recent
decisions
of
this
court
have
made
it
clear
that
the
court
is
no
longer
content
to
settle
for
these
speculative,
hypothetical
possibilities
of
collision
which
brings
me
to
ferc's
position.
all
they
have
been
able
to
offer
in
the
way
of
an
alleged
conflict
is
that
this
state
requirement
might
in
some
way
conflict
with
their
section
601(c)
powers
which
is
the
power
not
to
prevent
somebody
from
buying
gas,
but
the
power
to
deny
a
pass-through
of
a
payment
for
fraud
or
abuse.
there
is
nothing
about
this
requirement
that
prevents
the
exercise
of
that
power.
if
they
can,
with
a
straight
face,
stand
up
here
and
claim
that
the
payment
of
a
market
price
is
the
result
of
fraud
or
abuse,
then
they
have
still
got
the
power
to
deny
the
pass-through.
the
same
holds
true
for
the
take
or
pay
payments.
if
they
claim
that
a
take
or
pay
payment
that
somebody
makes
and
then
tries
to
pass-through
as
the
result
of
fraud
or
abuse,
they
can
deny
that
pass-through
which
brings
me
to
this
closing
point.
without
the
protection
of
this
simple
rule...
producers
are
not
dumb.
for
the
same
considerations
that
they
sought
the
protection
of
the
intrastate
market
before
the
ngpa
was
passed,
where
they
could
get
a
better
deal,
they
will
seek
the
protection
of
an
intrastate
market
in
which
they
are
not
treated
like
this,
in
which
the
coastals
of
the
world,
the
one
percent
owners,
whether
they
are
professionals,
whether
they
are
farmers
who
have
leased,
will
not
be
treated
like
this,
or
the
state
will
resort
to
more
disruptive
measures.
in
other
words,
the
state
could
come
in
and
completely
shut
in
the
field
until
every
owner
had
a
contract
signed
up.
it
would
be
disruptive,
but
it
would
clearly
be
within
the
conservation
powers
to
prevent
waste.
it
will
discourage
producers
from
competing
against
one
another.
independents...
all
the
world
of
oil
and
gas
is
divided
into
independents
and
majors
and
if
the
independents
end
up
with
the
contracts
and
the
majors...
the
majors
end
up
with
the
contracts
and
the
independents
are
left
to
scramble
for
themselves,
they
don't
compete.
more
fundamentally
though,
this
practical
observation:
if
because
of
the
ngpa
a
producer
and
a
pipe
line
can
agree
like
they
did
in
the
case
of
the
florida
gas
contract,
that
we
will
take
all
owners'
gas
regardless
of
whether
they
are
signed
up
and
we
will
take
their
gas
ratably,
and
there
is
nothing
ferc
can
do
to
prevent
that.
if
they
can
contract
for
that
protection,
which
they
can,
and
nobody
denies
it...
they
did
it
in
the
harkins
contracts
in
the
states,
they
did
it
in
the
florida
gas
contract,
then
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
the
state
in
the
exercise
of
its
conservation
powers
from
stepping
in
and
providing
that
minimal
protection
where
the
parties
fail
to
agree.
one
question
has
come
up
about,
well,
is
there
a
better
way
that
the
states
can
handle
this,
the
so-called
market
demand
allocation
system.
that
is
a
gimmick
and
a
game
which
mississippi
decided
in
1948
that
we
are
not
going
to
play.
it
serves
only
one
or
two
purposes,
allowing
the
pipe
lines
to
run
the
state
allowable
system
or
getting
the
state
involved
in
a
socio-economic
decision
that
you
pipe
lines
tell
us
how
much
gas
you
want
to
buy
and
we
will
dole
it
out
among
the
different
pools
in
the
state.
that
is
not
a
conservation
function.
the
purpose
of
that
rule
is
not
to
protect
owners
in
a
given
pool
from
drainage
and
it
is
not
to
give
owners
in
a
pool
an
opportunity
to
sell.
it
gets
the
state
intruding
even
more
so
into
contractual
affairs.
mississippi
has
a
pure
allowable
system
and
to
the
claims
that
the
market
demand
allocation
system
is
the
best
way
to
go,
i
refer
the
court
to
the
texas
law
journal
article
which
cites
that
the
blue
ribbon
panel
appointed
by
the
texas
railroad
commission
to
investigate
the
question
of
unratable
takes
found
that
under
their
own
system
of
market
demand
allocations
that
unratable
takes
were
still
occurring.
while
some
people
might
think
that
that
is
the
best
way
to
go,
mississippi
has
chosen
a
pure
allowable
system
in
which,
based
on
maximum
efficient
rate
of
flow
of
wells,
they
set
the
ceiling
and
the
pipe
lines
are
free
to
come
in
and
take
100
percent,
one
percent,
50
percent,
they
can
vary
their
takes
at
noon
and
at
midnight.
they
have
the
complete
freedom
on
what
their
takes
are
going
to
be.
the
state
is
not
involved
in
some
game
of
manipulating
and
gerrymandering
allowables.
thank
you,
your
honor.
if
there
are
no
questions,
the
attorney
general
would
like
to
talk.
