mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
ask
a
question?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
think
you
undoubtedly,
counsel,
have
answered
this,
but
i
am
not
entirely
clear
about
it.
it
is
agreed,
i
assume,
that
section
601
of
the
1978
act
removes
well
head
sales,
deep
wells,
15,000
feet
or
under,
from
federal
commission
regulations.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--the
solicitor
general's
brief
says
the
ngpa
makes
clear
that
congress,
in
removing
certain
well
head
sales
from
the
commission's
regulatory
jurisdiction,
intended
that
they
be
deregulated.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
it
doesn't
say
anything
at
this
point
in
the
brief
about
the
price.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
let
me
follow
up
with
another
question.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
it
is
deregulated,
is
it
your
position
the
state
has
no
authority
whatever
to
regulate
this
gas?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
will
that
result
in
transco
being
able
to
drain
gas--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--as
it
has
been
done
in
the
past?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
who
will
control
that?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
the
ratable
take
rule
doesn't
apply,
what
will
keep
transco
from
taking
gas
only
from
parties
with
whom
it
had
contracts?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
repeat
it
once
more?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
there
any
federal
regulation
that
prevents
transco
from
doing
what
it
was
doing
when
the
ratable
take
rule
is
applied
here,
that
is
drain
gas
from
other
producers,
from
other
owners?
is
there
any
regulation
anywhere
that
prevents
that?
