justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
the
effect
of
that
state
order,
because
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
it.
did
it
require
transco
to
take
more
gas
or
simply
to
spread
the
payments
around
for
the
gas
that
it
did
take?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
you
could
answer
my
question
it
would
help
me
understand
your
response.
did
the
state
order
require
transco
to
take
more
gas
or
simply
to
spread
the
payments
out
to
a
broader
group
of
people
for
the
gas
it
did
take?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
right
now,
i
suppose,
the
court
below
remanded
for
a
determination
of
what
price
ultimately
would
have
to
be
paid
for
these
other
pool
owners,
so
we
don't
even
know
what
it
would
cost
ultimately,
i
gather.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
maybe
i
misunderstand
the
order,
but
i
thought
that
to
the
extent
that
the
state
interfered
with
your
arrangement,
it
was
on
behalf
of
the
other
owners
of
the
common
pool
and
that
the
amount
to
be
paid
then
was
not
the
amount
to
be
paid
getty
under
the
contract--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but
some
reasonable
rate
based
on
present
or
then
current
market.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
are
today's
market
conditions
compared
to
what
they
were
when
this
problem
arose?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
incurred.
what
do
you
mean?
i
don't
even
know
what
you
are
talking
about
when
you
say
$50
million
incurred.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
is
a
drop
in
demand
for
the
gas?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
didn't
the
natural
gas
policy
act
deregulate
for
this
type
of
gas
that
is
involved
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
action
specifically
could
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
take
that
would
conflict
with
the
state's
order
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
this
particular
gas
was
taken
out
of
their
regulatory
jurisdiction,
wasn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but,
if
you
are
right
about
that,
i
would
assume
that
the
state's
order,
even
just
as
applied
to
intrastate
gas
purchases,
would
have
the
same
kind
of
effect
and
subject
the
state
to
the
same
argument.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
we
are
talking
about
the
pre-emption
argument,
i
guess.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
fit
this
under
the
fraud
or
abuse
section?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
power
only
exists
if
it
does
amount
to
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
feit,
what
do
you
think
that
a
state
can
properly
do
within
its
regulatory
powers
that
remain
to
protect
common
pool
owners?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
don't
understand
your
answer.
what
is
it
that
you
think
the
states
can
properly
do
within
their
regulatory
authority?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
there
were
no
take
or
pay
contract,
do
you
think
the
state
regulation
would
be
valid
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
think
if
there
were
no
take
or
pay
contract
it
might
be
valid.
is
that
what
i--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
should
the
validity
of
the
state's
ratable
take
policy
turn
on
the
fortuity
of
whether
your
company
enters
into
a
take
or
pay
contract?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but,
you
are
not
required
today,
are
you,
to
enter
into
a
take
or
pay
contract
for
this
kind
of
gas
by
any
federal
requirement
that
you
do
so?
