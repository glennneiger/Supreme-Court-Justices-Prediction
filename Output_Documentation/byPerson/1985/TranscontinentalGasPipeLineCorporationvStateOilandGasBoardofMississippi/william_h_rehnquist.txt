mr.
grower,
what
is
a
take
or
pay?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
it
can
be
recouped
only
by
taking
more
than
85
percent?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wasn't
that
a
price
regulation
in
northern
natural?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
the
regulation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
thought
it
was
different
though.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
taylor,
justice
stevens
asked
you
a
couple
of
moments
ago
whether
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
hadn't
disclaimed
reliance
upon
the
conservation
element.
and,
if
you
look
at
page
34a
of
the
jurisdiction
statement
which
the
appellant...
i
am
looking
at
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi.
it
says
in
the
middle
paragraph
beginning
"coastal,
getty
and
the
other
producers
argue
that
conservation
of
an
important
natural
resource
and
the
prevention
of
waste
are
implicated.
"
"without
doubt,
if
this
were
so,
such
would
be
a
legitimate
local
interest.
"
it
is
difficult,
however,
for
us
to
see
how
there
is
a
waste
of
natural
resources
when
an
interstate
pipe
line
company
refuses
to
take
ratably
or
otherwise.
and,
in
the
paragraph
after
that
they
go
on
and
say
that
"the
true
and
entirely
legitimate
local
interest
here
implicated
is
fairness.
"
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
some
place
else
where
they
say
that
it
is
conservation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
even
though
there
is
no
contract?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
remanded
the
case
to
the
trial
court
for
determination
of
that
issue,
didn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
we
really
don't
know
what
price
will
finally
be
determined
by
the
mississippi
state
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
would
the
question
be
different
here
if
these
contracts,
these
take
or
pay
contracts
had
been
entered
after
the
time
that
the
ferc
ceased
to
require
them?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
they
had
take
or
pay
contracts
and
there
were
clauses
that
were
voluntarily
entered
into
by
the
pipe
line
without
any
requirement
that
it
do
so
from
the
federal
government.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
trying
to
answer
my
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
my
question
to
you
was
if
there
were
take
or
pay
contracts
voluntarily
entered
into
by
the
pipe
line
company
without
any
requirement
they
do
so
from
the
federal
government.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
mean,
part
of
the
regulatory
scheme
if
it
is
not
a
requirement?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
all
you
are
saying
is
it
was
permitted?
