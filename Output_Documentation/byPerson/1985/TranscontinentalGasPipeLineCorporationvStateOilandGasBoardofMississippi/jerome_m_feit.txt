mr.
jerome
m.
feit
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
very
squarely
raises
the
pre-emption
question
as
the
continuing
vitality
of
northern
natural.
the
facts,
as
mr.
grower
stated,
are
essentially
the
same
statutory
scheme,
either
comply
with
the
state
ratable
take
order
and
take
more
gas
than
it
was
able
to
need
for
its
customers
or
take
less
gas
under
its
take
or
pay
provisions
and
incur
costs
with
the
ultimate
result
being,
as
northern
natural
said,
that
that
could
seriously
impair
the
federal
commission's
authority
to
regulate
the
intricate
relationship
between
the
purchasers'
cost
structures
and
eventual
cost
to
wholesale
customers.
the
question,
and
the
state
courts
quite
clearly
recognized,
that
the
decision
would
go
in
favor
of
transco
in
that
case
if
northern
natural
was
still
good
law.
the
divergence,
the
difference
was
that
northern
natural,
the
courts
found,
was
not
good
law
by
virtue
of
their
reading
of
the
natural
gas
policy
act
and
the
natural
gas
act.
our
reading,
on
the
contrary,
is
totally
to
the
opposite.
we
believe
that
both
under
the
natural
gas
policy
act
and
the
natural
gas
act
that
the
northern
natural
case
has
continuing
validity.
let
me
turn
to
the
natural
gas
policy
act.
there
are
two
kinds
of
things
under
that
statute
which
i
think
indicate
the
continuing
nature
of
non-state
intervention
and
effective
federal
control.
as
you
know,
this
was...
the
act
was
to
set
up
a
nation-wide
market
in
gas
because
of
the
problems
that
had
arisen.
and,
what
congress
did
under
the
natural
gas
policy
act
in
title
i
was
statutorily
fix
the
prices,
statutorily
fix...
detail
the
prices
for
gas.
ferc
no
longer
had
any
authority
under
that
to
fix
those
prices.
but,
in
addition
to
that
kind
of
scheme...
in
addition
to
that,
ferc
did
have
specific
authority
under
title
vi
of
the
natural
gas
policy
act
to
prohibit
the
pass
through
of
such
gas
costs
which
is
found
to
be
the
product
of
fraud,
abuse,
or
similar
grounds.
so,
what
you
had
was
just
the
opposite
of
a
commission
of
state
intervention.
you
had
a
free
market
under
title
i
which
ferc
could
not
interfere
with
as
you
pointed
out
in
the
mid-louisiana
opinion.
and,
on
the
other
hand,
you
had
ferc's
control
to
assure
that
gas
costs...
that
pricing
practices
of
pipe
lines
are
not
fraud,
abusive,
or
invalid
on
similar
grounds
from
passing
through.
that
is
the
natural--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
--i
don't
know
if...
my
point
is
the
power
exists.
i
don't
know
whether
in
fact
this
amounts
to
fraud
or
abuse
or
similar
grounds.
it
seems
to
me--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
--well,
the
power
to
impose
denial
to
pass
through
exists.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
i
might
add
that
this
very
case
is
presently
pending
not
under
the
natural
gas
policy
act,
but
my
next
point,
under
the
natural
gas
act
prudent
standing
in
which
the
staff
of
ferc
is
arguing
to
the
commission
that
the
fact
that
transco
complied
with
the
state
order,
complied
with
the
state
order,
in
fact,
made
those
purchasing
practices
subject
to
natural
gas
act
prudence
regulation.
and,
this,
i
think,
pinpoints
the
concern
in
maryland
v.
louisiana.
the
concern
is
that
we
regulate
interstate
pipe
lines
under
the
natural
gas
act
and
in
mid-louisiana
it
was
made
crystal
clear
that
while
ferc
has
no
continuing
regulatory
control
on
the
prices
under
title
i,
it
has
continuing
control,
as
it
always
had,
under
the
relationship
of
the
pipe
line
to
its
downstream
customers.
so
that
rather
than
northern
natural
in
our
view
losing
vitality
by
virtue
of
the
natural
gas
policy
act,
the
natural
gas
policy
act
has
established
a
free
market,
no
state
interference
with
whatever
authority
exists,
exists
in
ferc
under
title
vi.
to
the
extent
there
is
additional
authority,
it
exists
under
the
prudent
standard
of
the
natural
gas
act.
so,
it
seems...
without
even
reaching
the
question
of
the
commerce
clause
issue,
it
seems
to
us
that
this
is
a
clear
case
of
federal
pre-emption
by
statute
and--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
--i
was
going
to
turn
to
that
exactly.
i
think,
one,
northern
natural
makes
plain
at
that
time
that
states
can
affect
the
producers;
that
is
the
statute
shall
be
directed...
the
device
in
northern
natural
was
the
problem
of
affecting
the
interstate
pipe
line.
i
realize
that
that
may
not
be
a
complete
answer.
there
is
another
case
coming
before
this
court.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
i
think
at
the
bottom
line
is
the
states
can
set
up
a
scheme
which
is
regulated
by
market
demand
situations.
let
me
just...
the
reason
i
mentioned
what
northern
natural
said,
because
that
was
the
rule
of
northern
natural.
northern
natural
said
you
cannot
deal
with
the
interstate
pipe
line,
you
can
only
regulate
the
producer.
i
am
suggesting
now
that
there
may
be
other
more
sophisticated
efforts.
many
states
have
adopted
market
demand
where
denominations
are
made
by
the
pipe
lines
and
it
is
based
on...
even
texas
has
monthly
kinds
of
crude.
that
may
pass
constitutional
muster
because
what
the
state
is
doing
then,
it
seems
to
me,
is
taking
care
of
its
own
mining
interest,
protection
of
waste,
protection
of
the
owners
of
the
pool,
which
clearly,
your
honor,
the
states
have.
we
have
never
taken
the
position,
and
i
don't
take
it
now,
that
the
states
do
not
have
significant
rights
over
their
minerals
within
the
state
and
natural
gas
is
such
a
mineral.
the
problem
is
that
to
the
extent
the
state
action
intrudes
upon
the
federal
structure
the
state
action
must
fail.
that
this
court
has
said
repeatedly
in
arkla
v.
hall,
maryland
v.
louisiana.
and,
the
reason
i
am
not
answering--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
--if
there
were
no
take
or
pay
contracts...
it
is
hard
to
answer
the
question.
i
think
it
would
turn
on
whether
the
pipe
line
is
being
required
to
change
its
purchasing
practices
in
a
way
that
makes
it
take
more
gas
than
it
wants,
because
it
affects...
it
is
not
only
mississippi
that
is
involved
here,
pipe
lines
have
sources
of
supply
throughout
the
producing
state.
and,
the
concern
of
ferc
is
not
that
one
state
provision
fails,
the
concern
of
ferc
is
how
the
entire
scheme
operates.
it
seems
to
us
that
it
may
well
be
a
case
where
a
state
directing...
more
than
produces
may
have
a
valid
statute.
our
position
here
is
simply
that
this
order
is
not
a
valid
statute.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
i
think
if
there
were
no
take
or
pay
contracts
and
the
pipe
line
was
taking
no
more
gas
than
it
needed
for
its
customers
or
it
was
required
to
take,
that
would
be
a
different...
might
be
a
different
case
because
there
was
more...
you
see,
the
vice
that
we
find
in
it
is
that
somehow
by
the
state
requiring
the
pipe
line
to
take
more
gas
than
it
wants...
it
is
not
the
pipe
line
that
is
the
essence
of
our
concern.
the
essence
of
our
concern
is
the
downstream
customer.
it
then
kind
of
intrudes
upon
that
relationship
and
that
is
where
the
difficulty
arises.
so,
while
i
think
there
can
be
valid
state
laws,
as
northern
natural
pointed
out,
and
market
demand
may
be
another
way
to
deal
with
the
problem.
these
are
a
myriad
of
concerns.
northern
natural
said
that
ferc
cannot
kind
of
deal
with
each
little
state
statute
and
have
the
state
accommodate
to
the
federal
concern...
i
am
sorry,
the
state
must
accommodate
the
federal
concern
and
not
the
federal
on
the
states'
concern.
unless
there
are
any
further
questions,
i
think
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
