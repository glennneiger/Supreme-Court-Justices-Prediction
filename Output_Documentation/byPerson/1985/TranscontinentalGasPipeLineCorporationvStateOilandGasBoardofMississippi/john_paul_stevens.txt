justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
question,
mr.
grower.
you
have
talked
a
great
deal
about
the
take
or
pay
contract.
had
your
client
not
entered
in
any
take
or
pay
contract,
but
had
foreseen
the
economic
situation
that
later
developed,
would
you
still
contend
that
the
missouri
rule
was
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
then
the
discussion
of
the
take
or
pay
contract
is
not
really
critical
to
your
constitutional
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
taylor,
as
i
understand
this
case,
the
conservation
power
is
not
implicated.
the
mississippi
supreme
court
expressly
disclaimed
that
as
i
understood.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
just
relied
on
fairness,
didn't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and,
they
expressly
disclaimed,
did
they
not,
reliance
on
conservation
as
the
motivating
force
for
the
regulation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
taylor,
your
definition
is
quite
different
from
the
mississippi
supreme
court.
they
seem
to
think
that
conservation
is
avoidance
of
waste
and
they
say
that
it
is
difficult
for
us
to
see
how
there
is
a
waste
of
natural
resources
when
an
interstate
pipe
line
company
refuses
to
take
ratably
or
otherwise.
waste
would
seem
to
follow
from
taking
too
much,
not
too
little.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
disagree
with
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
a
little
slower,
i
think,
perhaps
than
you
are,
but
i
think
you
are
arguing
just
commerce
now
and
not
pre-emption
at
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
the
two
arguments
merge
or
are
quite
the
same?
peerless
has
nothing
to
do
with
pre-emption
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
question?
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
correctly.
under
the
mississippi
rule,
must
the
pipe
line
pay
the
non-contract
purchaser
the
same
price
that
it
pays
the
contract
purchaser?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
can
have
a
price
discrimination
and
there
is
no
state
problem
with--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
does
it
at
least
insist
that
the
price
paid
to
the
non-contract
purchaser
be
the
fair
market
price?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand,
but
could
they...
say
the
market
price
is
$1.00
a
thousand
cubic
feet
or
whatever
it
might
be,
could
they
just
pay
a
nickel
and
would
that
satisfy
the--
