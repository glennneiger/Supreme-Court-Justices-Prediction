mr.
lauber,
last
week
we
had
the
all-events
test.
this
week
we
have
the
"from
test"?
unknown
speaker
mr.
lauber,
if
they
sold
it
to
the
public
in
general,
what
difference
would
it
make?
unknown
speaker
i
suspect
some
arguments
can
be
made
the
other
way,
that
if
the
public
in
general
were
being
solicited,
that
that
would
more
clearly
put
them
in
the
business
community.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
about
those
cases,
which
i
have
not
read?
are
those
cases
in
which
there
were
dividends
paid
to
the
policyholders?
unknown
speaker
and
the
policyholder
retained
the
dividend?
unknown
speaker
--unlike
this
case
where
the
policyholder
must
in
effect
contribute
it
to
the
endowment.
unknown
speaker
was
the
deduction
claimed
in
those
cases
as
a
charitable
contribution
or
as
a
business
deduction,
the
group,
the
"group
gift"
in
those
cases?
unknown
speaker
so
it's
different.
so
it's
not
really...
those
were
really--
unknown
speaker
--but
wouldn't
they...
wouldn't
all
the
skiers
have
to
be
members
of
the
lodge
for
the
example
to
be
fair?
unknown
speaker
kind
of
an
unlikely
church
ski
lodge,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
if
this
is
a
big
loophole,
you
ought
to
have
a
lot
of
examples
that
fit
rather
closely,
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
this
one
fits.
unknown
speaker
correct.
unknown
speaker
i
understand,
but
this
is
the
dimensions
of
this
big
loophole
you're
describing,
these
cases
like
this
where
all
the
members
are
also
all
the
customers
of
the
trade
or
business,
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
mr.
lauber,
before
you
get
to
your
closing,
suppose
this
fund
had
been
solely
administered
by
the
aba
and
it
was
underwritten
by
an
outside
company.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
ten
o'clock
[=
10:00].
