mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
these
tax
refund
actions
present
two
questions.
the
first
is
whether
the
american
bar
endowment,
a
charitable
affiliate
of
the
aba,
is
subjected
to
unrelated
business
income
tax
on
the
profits
it
derives
from
running
a
group
insurance
program
for
its
members.
the
second
question
is
whether
the
individual
respondents,
aba
members
who
acquired
insurance
from
the
endowment,
are
entitled
to
deduct
a
portion
of
their
insurance
premium
as
a
charitable
contribution.
because
respondents
were
plaintiffs
in
a
tax
refund
suit,
they
of
course
had
the
burden
of
proof.
the
endowment
conceded
that
its
insurance
activities
were
regularly
carried
on,
and
that
those
activities
were
unrelated
to
the
accomplishment
of
its
educational
objectives.
in
order
to
avoid
income
tax
on
its
insurance
revenues,
therefore,
the
endowment
was
required
to
prove
that
the
insurance
operation
was
not
a
trade
or
business.
section
513(c)
of
the
code
defines
a
trade
or
business
as
any
activity
which
is
carried
on
for
the
production
of
income
from
the
sale
of
goods
or
the
performance
of
services.
respondent
agrees
that
its
insurance
operation
satisfies
every
element
of
that
definition
in
the
statute,
except
for
one
that
might
be
called
the
"from"
test.
the
endowment
argued
that
its
$5
million
in
annual
insurance
profits
are
not
derived
from
the
insurance
goods
that
it
sells
or
from
the
insurance
services
it
performs.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
the
"from"
test.
but
that's
what
they
argue.
they
argue
that
all
this
money
they
are
making
doesn't
come
from
the
insurance
services
that
its
staff
of
40
perform
during
their
working
day,
but
rather,
all
the
money
comes
from
charitable
fundraising.
now,
that
argument
in
turn
is
based
on
their
group
gift
theory
which
is
the
core
of
their
case.
the
group
gift
theory
starts
from
the
premise
that
the
endowment
sells
insurance
only
to
aba
members
and
the
dependents
of
aba
members.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
they
would
then
have
a
harder
time
making
their
group
gift
argument
because
their
group
gift
argument,
which
is
really
the
guts
of
their
case,
depends
on
selling
only
or
largely
to
the
organization's
own
members.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
think
they
would
agree
with
that,
but
their
argument
is
because
they
only
sell
to
members,
they
are
different.
and
they
reason
that
although
they
charge
fair
market,
competitive
prices
for
their
insurance,
they
set
their
prices
at
a
level
that
enables
them
to
make
fairly
sizeable
profits.
now,
they
argue
that
their
members,
acting
collectively,
have
the
theoretical
power
to
deprive
them
of
any
profits
by
forcing
the
endowment
to
sell
insurance
at
a
lower
price,
at
a
price
that
would
only
cover
its
costs
and
let
them
make
no
profit
at
all.
so
they
argue
that
all
the
profit
they
make
comes
at
the
sufferance
of
their
members,
and
therefore,
every
dollar
of
profit
does
not
come
from
the
insurance
business,
but
it
comes
from
charitable
fundraising
in
the
form
of
a
group
gift
that
the
members
make
by
refraining
from
requiring
the
endowment
to
operate
at
cost.
the
claims
court
accepted
this
group
gift
argument.
it
reasoned
that
the
idea
of
a
group
profiting
from
its
own
members
is
almost
a
contradiction
in
terms,
and
the
claims
court
held
as
a
matter
of
law
that
an
enterprise
that
depends
on
the
consent
of
its
members
for
its
profits
is
not
a
trade
or
business.
this
group
gift
theory,
for
which
neither
the
courts
below
nor
respondent
cites
any
authority
or
precedent,
is
wrong
for
four
independent
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
group
gift
idea
is
foreclosed
by
the
legislative
history
of
the
1969
law
in
which
congress
enacted
its
definition
of
the
term
trade
or
business.
the
house
and
senate
report
accompanying
that
law
discussed
the
group
insurance
activities
of
several
categories
of
tax
exempt
groups,
like
fraternal
beneficiary
societies,
such
as
the
knights
of
columbus
or
moose.
these
groups
were
authorized
by
the
code
to
provide
insurance
to
their
members
and
their
dependents
as
part
of
their
tax-exempt
mission.
that
is,
for
these
groups,
the
provision
of
insurance
to
members
was
a
related
function.
both
the
house
and
senate
reports
refer
to
these
group
insurance
activities
as
a
business
but
note
that
those
groups
would
be
immune
from
tax
on
their
insurance
profits
because
for
them
the
insurance
business
was
related
to
their
exempt
function.
for
example,
the
house
report
wrote
the
bill
excludes
earnings
from
businesses
related
to
an
organization's
exempt
function,
such
as
an
insurance
business
run
by
a
fraternal
beneficial
association
for
its
members.
now,
these
groups,
like
the
endowment,
sold
insurance
only
through
their
members
and
the
dependents
of
their
members.
thus,
it
was
true
for
them
as
for
the
endowment
that
the
members
had
the
theoretical
power
to
deprive
them
of
any
profits
at
all
by
making
a
group
gift.
but
the
congress
nevertheless
characterized
those
group
insurance
activities
as
a
business,
and
this
we
think
shows
that
the
group
gift
idea
has
no
place
under
section
513(c).
secondly,
respondents'
group
gift
theory
is
foreclosed
by
three
courts
of
appeals
decisions
that
respondent
concedes
to
be
correct.
the
courts
of
appeals
for
the
fourth,
fifth
and
sixth
circuits
have
held
that
another
category
of
tax-exempt
group,
that
is,
a
professional
association
organized
under
section
501(c)(6)
as
a
business
league,
does
run
a
trade
or
business
when
it
provides
insurance
services
and
products
to
its
members
and
their
dependents.
the
endowment
makes
no
effort
to
distinguish
its
own
insurance
operation
from
the
insurance
operations
of
the
groups
in
those
other
cases.
respondent
agrees,
in
other
words,
that
its
full
time
staff
of
40
people
during,
their
working
day
provide
the...
perform
the
same
kinds
of
promotional,
administrative
and
marketing
services
and
offer
the
same
kinds
of
insurance
products
that
the
groups
in
these
other
cases
offer.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
the
rebates
to
the...
i
think
in
one
of
the
cases
there
were
dividends
which
the
group
did
funnel
through
to
the
policyholders.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
pardon
me?
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
retained
the
dividend.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
that's
right.
those
groups,
those
business
leagues
ran
the
insurance
operation
as
a
service
to
members,
more
or
less.
there
was
one
of
the
cases
where
the
policy
dividends
came
in
to
the
group
as
an
insurance
experience
rated
reserve,
and
it
did
not
distribute
those
to
the
members.
but
the
compensations
to
the
group
took
various
forms,
either
a
percentage
of
premiums
or
a
reserve,
experience
rated
reserve
that
came
to
the
group.
and
the
courts
held
to
the
extent
that
the
group
held
on
to
the
money
rather
than
distributing
it
out
to
the
members,
it
was
taxable
on
the
income.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
if
they
did
what
the
irs
suggested,
that
they
agreed
to
let
the
members
have
their
dividends
back
and
asked
them
voluntarily
to
donate
the
dividends
back
to
the
endowment
as
a
gift,
the
revenues
only
would
be...
would
be
lower
only
if
members
declined
to
make
the
contribution.
now,
the
endowment
is
telling
us
how
generous
their
members
are.
if
that
is
true,
the
revenue
should
not
be
much
lower
under
that
mode
of
operation.
but
we
think
the
fact
that
they
require
them
to
waive
their
dividend
shows
they
really
don't
trust
the
generosity
of
their
members,
and
are
really
running
an
insurance
business,
and
the
money
must
come
to
them
in
the
form
of
insurance
revenues,
not
from
charitable
contributions
because
they
don't
really
trust
their
members.
i
think
that's
what
the
case
really
comes
down
to.
in
any
event,
the
business
leagues
involved
in
these
other
cases
which
respondent
agrees
to
be
correct
could
also
have
argued
that
because
they
only
sold
insurance
to
their
members
and
the
dependents
of
their
members,
that
their
insurance
activity
was
not
a
trade
or
business
but
was
simply
a
fundraising
activity,
and
that
the
group
was
making
a
group
gift
to
them.
however,
all
three
courts
of
appeals
held
that
those
business
leagues
were
in
the
trade
or
business,
and
respondent
agrees--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--it
couldn't
have
been
a
tax
deductible
charitable
gift
because
there
are--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--that
all
the
profits
they
made
were
made
at
the
sufferance
of
their
members,
because
the
members
refrained
from
making
them
operate
at
cost,
and
therefore,
whatever
revenues
they
got
were
really
a
transfer
from
the
group
as
a
whole.
it
wouldn't
have
been
a
group
gift,
it
would
have
been
a
group
business
deduction
or
something.
but
the
same
principle
would
apply,
and
those
courts
did
not
accept
that
principle.
it
wasn't
argued.
thirdly,
the
group
gift
idea
respondent
suggests
would
open
a
loophole
in
the
statute
that
congress
did
not
intend
and
which
we
think
the
language
of
the
statute
does
not
support.
the
endowment's
theory
would
enable
any
charity
to
run
what
would
appear
for
all
the
world
to
be
a
trade
or
business,
what
would
look
and
act
like
a
trade
or
business,
yet
escape
tax
on
its
business
profits
simply
by
arranging
to
do
most
of
its
business
with
its
members.
for
example,
a
church
could
run
a
chain,
of
ski
lodges.
as
long
as
most
of
the
skiers
were
members
of
the
church,
the
church
could
argue
that
its
members
had
the
theoretical
power
to
deprive
it
of
any
profits,
that
all
of
its
ski
lodge
income
came
not
from
the
ski
lodge
business
but
from
a
charitable
fundraiser.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
premise
of
their
argument
is
there
has
to
be
enough
members
in
the
customer
base
to
give
the
members
a
real
interest
in
trying
to
force
the
prices
down.
they
wouldn't
have
to
have
all
the
members--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
if
the
ski
lodge,
if
the
church--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
it
would,
justice
stevens,
if
the
church
only
let
members
of
the
church
go
to
the
ski
lodge.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
but
our
position
would
be
it
would
still
be
in
the
ski
lodge
business,
even
though
only
members
were
allowed
to
ski
there.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
or
where
the
group
could
arrange
only
to
do
it
for
members.
you
know,
all
these
insurance
cases
involve
plans
that
only
are
provided
for
members.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
it
could
cover
any
insurance
plan
where
a,
for
example,
say
a
university
would
set
up
a
travel
agency
which
would
run
caribbean
tours
for
alumni
and
faculty.
they
could
argue
that
because
all
their
customers
were
members
that
had
the
power
to
require
it
to
lower
its
prices,
that
it
wasn't
in
the
travel
agency
business.
but
you
can
imagine
a
lot
of
situations
where
you
would
have
a
group
with
a
large
membership
base
who
might
want
certain
services,
and
this
group
could
provide
it
to
the
membership
and
claim
it
wasn't
in
a
business
simply
because
most
of
its
customers
were
its
own
members.
we
think
this
would
open
up
a
potentially
large
loophole
in
the
statute
because
many
groups
do
offer
services
to
their
members.
and
the
language
of
the
statute,
again,
to
go
back
to
it,
defines
a
trade
or
business
as
any
activity
carried
on
for
the
production
of
income
from
the
sale
of
goods
or
the
performance
of
services.
the
statute
does
not
refer
to
the
customer
base
of
the
business.
there's
nothing
to
suggest
that
a
given
group
of
activities
would
be
a
business
in
one
case
because
of
its
customers
yet
would
not
be
a
business
in
another
case
because
it
had
a
different
set
of
customers.
finally,
we
think
respondent's
group
gift
theory
on
its
own
terms
doesn't
make
any
sense.
the
cold
fact
is
that
the
endowment
requires
every
insured
to
waive
his
claim
to
any
policy
dividends
as
an
absolute
condition
of
buying
the
insurance.
it
is
simply
part
of
the
price
of
admission.
the
claims
court
accordingly
held
correctly,
we
think,
that
the
individual
respondents
are
not
entitled
to
deduct
any
portion
of
their
premiums
as
a
charitable
contribution
because
they
had
failed
to
prove
that
they
paid
more
for
the
insurance
than
it
was
worth
and
that
they
paid
any
alleged
excess
with
the
intention
of
benefitting
the
charity.
the
claims
court
found
that
each
individual
respondent
in
buying
the
endowment's
insurance
was
pursuing
only
his
own
economic
best
interests.
given
the
obvious
nongift
character
of
each
of
these
transactions
viewed
individually,
we
think
it
makes
no
sense
that
viewed
collectively
they
add
up
to
some
kind
of
group
gift.
in
closing
i
would
like
to
make
one
point
that
might
be
called
the--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--i
think
that
would
make
our
case
even
stronger
because
there...
the
other
side
has
argued
they
don't
really
sell
insurance,
that
the
underwriters
sell
the
insurance,
all
they
do
is
perform
services
in
offering
the
insurance
at
retail.
now,
if
they
were
underwriting,
too,
it
would
plainly...
they
couldn't
even
argue
that
they
weren't
selling
insurance.
but
i
think
it
would
make
no
difference,
although
it
would
make
our
case
that
much
stronger
if
that
were
true.
but
the
equities
of
this
case
have
not
been
as
apparent
to
the
lower
courts
as
they
are
to
us,
and
we
think
the
litigation
below
showed
the
government
often
has
a
hard
time
winning
cases
against
charities,
particularly
where
the
charities
are
benefitting
legal
education.
but
i
think
our
position
is
neither
inequitable
nor
unfair.
the
irs
has
made
clear
to
the
endowment
that
the
only
thine
they
would
have
to
do
in
order
to
avoid
any
income
tax
on
their
revenues
is
to
agree
to
let
the
members
have
their
dividends
back.
if
the
endowment
were
to
refund
the
dividends
to
the
members
and
the
member
were
then
voluntarily
and
individually
to
donate
the
money
back
to
the
endowment,
it
is
clear,
and
the
irs
has
agreed
that
the
members
would
then
be
entitled
to
a
charitable
contribution
deduction
and
that
that
money
would
come
into
the
hands
of
the
endowment
as
charitable
receipts,
not
as
business
income.
the
key
question,
then,
is
why
doesn't
the
endowment
do
that?
if
its
members
are
as
generous
as
they
say,
that
should
not
produce
a
huge
decrease
in
their
revenues.
the
fact
that
they
have
refused
to
do
that
we
think
shows
that
they
are
not
content
to
rely
on
charitable
fundraising
but
want
to
run
a
business.
that
is
why
they
are
subject
to
tax.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
a
few
points.
respondent
argued
at
several
points
that
what
happened
here
is
that
the
aba
members
paid
$200
for
$100.
the
claims
court
found
to
the
contrary.
the
claims
court
found
as
a
fact
that
the
endowment
set
its
insurance
prices
at
a
level
that
was
competitive
with
other
insurance
products
available
on
the
market,
and
the
aba
itself
did
a
study
that
was
put
into
evidence
that
showed
the
cost
of
20
state
bar
plans
was
higher
than
the
endowment's
cost
and
only
four
cost
less.
as
to
the
individual
respondents,
the
claims
court
found
as
a
fact
that
each
individual
had
failed
to
prove
that
he
paid
more
than
the
fair
market
value
of
the
insurance
he
applied
for.
the
claims
court
accordingly
held
that
there
were
no
individual
gifts
made
by
the
respondents.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
the
amount
of
the
dividend
is
simply
a
function
of
the
price
that
the
endowment
charges.
the
higher
the
growth
premium
they
charge,
the
more
the
dividend.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
but
what
that
$100
is
part
of
the
price
they
are
charging
for
the
insurance.
they
are
charging
$200
in
premiums,
and
the
claims
court
found
the
insurance
was
worth
that.
now,
the
reason
the
dividends
are
so
high
is
because
of
the
very
favorable
experience
of
endowment
members
for
health
and
illness
and
premature
death.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
if
the
endowment...
you
mean
the
endowment
would
just
offer...
not
make
any
profits.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
that's
right.
what
they're
comparing
the
price
they
actually
charged
to
is
what
they
could
have
charged
had
they
chosen
to
make
no
profit,
but
that
is
not
the
fair
market
value
of
the
commodity
they
were
selling.
the
fair
market
value
is
what
other
competing
insurance
products
sold
for
in
the
market.
and
the
evidence
at
trial
showed
that
it
was...
the
other
competing
products
were
more
expensive
than
the
endowment's
or
about
the
same.
so
what
they
are
saying
is
that
the
value
of
what
they
are
selling
is
what
they
could
have
charged
had
they
decided
to
make
no
profit.
that
just
begs
the
question.
every
middleman
marks
up
the
products
that
he
sells.
that's
how
he
makes
money.
and
you
can't
say
that
the
middleman's
cost
is
the
fair
market
value
of
the
product
he
is
selling.
look
at
the
retail
value
of
what
he
is
selling.
and
here
the
evidence
showed
the
retail
value
of
what
they
were
selling
was
comparable
to
other
products
in
the
marketplace.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
they
haven't
filed
an
amicus
brief
on
our
behalf.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
the
competitors
of
the
endowment
here
most
directly
would
be
other
groups
offering
group
insurance
to--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--no,
new
york
life
is
an
underwriter.
it
would
be
groups
like
other
state
and
local
bar
associations,
legal
fraternities,
college
alumni
groups
or
anybody
who
is
selling
group
insurance,
credit
card
companies,
oil
companies.
you
know,
every
day
in
the
mail
you
get
letters
offering
to
sell
you
insurance.
all
those
people
are
competing
for
the
same
market
that
the
abe
is.
now,
the
claims
court
therefore
found
that
none
of
the
individuals
had
made
gifts.
the
question
then
is
whether
all
those
little
nongifts
could
add
up
to
a
group
gift,
and
the
claims
court's
finding
that
at
did
was
not
a
finding
of
fact.
that
was
a
legal
conclusion.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
they
could
be.
the
thing
is
that
they
all
sell
insurance
only
to
their
members,
so
if
there
was
some
guy
who
was
both
a
knight
of
columbus
and
a
lawyer
or
member
of
the
aba,
he
would
have
insurance
offered
to
him
possibly
both
by
the
knights
of
columbus
and
by
the
abe.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
that's
exempt.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
but
now
there
are
other
non...
many
noncharitable
groups
who
also
are
trying
to
sell
insurance.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
part
of
the
market
is
partially
tax-exempt,
but
a
great
deal
of
it
isn't
as
well,
credit
card
companies,
american
express,
visa,
all
the
rest
of
them.
now,
the
claims
court's
conclusion
that
all
of
these
individual
nongifts
added
up
to
a
group
gift
was
not
a
finding
of
fact.
that
was
a
construction
of
the
statute.
the
claims
court
held
as
a
matter
of
law
that
an
enterprise
that
depends
on
the
consent
of
its
customers
for
its
profits
is
not
a
trade
or
business.
that
was
not
a
finding
of
fact.
that
was
a
conclusion
of
law.
so
we
think
that
this
group
gift
idea
is
supported
by
no
findings
of
fact,
simply
a
notion
that
the
abe
put
into
judge
kozinski's
head.
and
we
think
that
must
be
evaluated
as
a
legal
matter,
not
as
a
factual
one.
now,
most
of
what
respondent
refers
to
as
findings
of
fact
are
irrelevant
as
a
matter
of
law.
they
keep
saying
that
the
claims
court
found
they
were
not
in
the
business,
that
that
is
the
ultimate
legal
question,
is
this
a
trade
or
business
as
defined
by
the
statute,
section
513(c).
that's
not
a
finding
of
fact.
the
keep
saying
that,
well,
the
claims
court
found
that
people
who
bought
the
insurance
wanted
to
aid
the
endowment's
charitable
endeavor.
that
is
also
irrelevant
as
a
matter
of
law.
people
who
bought
spaghetti
from
nyu's
muller
macaroni
company
rather
than
from
ronzoni
may
have
wanted
to
held
out
nyu
but
didn't
put...
didn't
mean
they
were
not
in
a
trade
or
business
of
selling
spaghetti.
the
intent
of
the
members
is
simply
irrelevant.
the
question
is
whether
the
endowment
was
carrying
on
an
activity
for
the
production
of
income
from
the
sale
of
goods
or
the
performance
of
services.
now,
the
group
gift
idea
we
think
not
only
doesn't
make
any
sense
as
a
legal
matter,
but
practically
speaking,
the
members
of
the
aba,
although
there
are...
they
can
be
convened,
the
fact
is
that
only
20
percent
of
aba
members
buy
the
insurance.
the
20
percent...
the
80
percent
who
don't
buy
the
insurance
don't
care
probably
what
the
20
percent
are
charged.
they
don't
mind
that
they
are
charged
a
price
that
enables
the
endowment
to
make
a
lot
of
money.
what
this
really
amounts
to
is
a
form
of
noblesse
oblige
under
which
the
majority
have
the
nobility
and
the
minority
the
obligation.
