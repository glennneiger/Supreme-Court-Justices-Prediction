justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
it's
in
the
record.
what
percentage
of
the
membership
of
the
american
bar
association
subscribe
to
this
insurance?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
about
something
like
20
percent
of
the
association.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
gregory,
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
you're
making
two
arguments,
and
i'm
trying
to
sort
them
out
in
my
mind.
one
is
that
an
individual
member,
when
he's
advised
that
he
doesn't,
you
know,
he
could
get
a
better
deal
in
effect,
you
are
not
saying
he
could
then
write
in
and
say
i
want
a
refund.
what
he's
doing,
you're
saying,
by
renewing
for
the
following
year,
he
in
effect
approves
of
the
program.
is
that
the
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
so
individually
they
vote
with
their
feet
by
keeping
the
policies.
but
then
the
second
argument
was...
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
followed.
you
say
the
membership
as
a
whole
has
elected
to
make
this
charitable
contribution.
what
is
the
membership?
is
it
the
20
percent
who
have
the
insurance
and
are
in
the
endowment,
or
is
it
the
100
percent
of
the
american
bar
association?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
100
percent
decided
to
give
away
the
money
that
belongs
to
20
percent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
puzzled
there
must
he
something,
i'm
sure
there
is
a
lot
to
the
case
i
don't
understand,
but
i'm
puzzled
as
to
why
you
don't
argue
more
forcefully
the
fact
that
the
20
percent
themselves,
individually,
are
electing...
and
presumably
lawyers
know
what
they're
doing...
to
take
this
unusually
expensive
insurance
and
thereby
to
make
the
contribution
as
they
renew
year
after
year.
why
isn't
that
sufficient?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
not
the
theory
of
the
lower
court
at
all,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i've
read
the
briefs.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
everybody
is
arguing
about
a
group
gift,
and
it
seems
to
me
that's
an
individual
gift,
and
that's
why--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
the
government
has
conceded
if
you
didn't
attach
the
condition
at
the
time
of
purchase
of
the
policy
but
you
sent
them
the
dividend
and
they
mailed
it
back,
then
there'd
be
no
lawsuit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
lauber,
is
it
correct
that
there
is
this
dramatic
difference
in
the
amount
of
the
dividends,
something
like
40
percent
in
this
program,
and
in
the
three
cases
you
cite,
there
is
about
5
percent
or
2
1/2
percent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
tends
to
show
they
were
paying
close
to
$200
for
$100
worth
of
services,
then.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
one
other
question.
in
the
cases
in
this
area,
generally
we
are
concerned
about
the
charity
taking
business
away
from
the
competing
entities
that
would
otherwise
be
getting
the
business.
i
take
it
the
insurance
industry
is
opposed
to
this
program,
there's
evidence
to
that
effect,
because
they
are
the
competitors
who
are
being
hurt?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
hadn't
noticed
any,
and
i
was
just
wondering
what
you
would
say
about
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
like
new
york
life,
would
that
be
one
of
them?
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
sorry,
but
i
am
really
trying
to
learn
something
about
this.
i
gather
there
are
a
lot
of
exemptions
in
the
insurance
industry.
you
indicated
earlier
that
a
moose
or
some
of
these
lodges,
are
they
competitors
of
this?
are
some
of
the
competitors
of
this
type
of
insurance
themselves
the
beneficiaries
of
specific
statutory
exemptions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
knights
of
columbus
program
is
exempt
by
a
specific--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
market
we
are
talking
about
in
which
the
competition
occurs
is
at
least
partially
exempt
from
taxation.
