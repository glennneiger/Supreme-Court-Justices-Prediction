justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
policyholder
then
retained
the
dividend--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
understand.
the
loophole
covers
insurance
plans,
but
really
doesn't
cover
anything
else.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
on
page
12a,
mr.
gregory?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
can't...
well,
perhaps...
it's
in
the
petition?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the
point
is
so
crucial,
it
is
somewhat
surprising
to
find
it
in
a
footnote.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
now
arguing,
mr.
gregory,
the
second
part
of
the
case,
whether
the
members
are
entitled
to
take
deductions,
or
are
you
arguing
the
unrelated
business
income
part
of
the
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
at
the
same
time.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
court
of
claims
found
against
you
on
the
deductibility
of
the
individual
members,
didn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
suit
yourself.
i
found
it
a
little
bit
confusing
because
i
wasn't
sure
which
point
you
were
arguing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
you're
arguing
the
second
point
now,
mr.
gregory,
i
thought
that
the
claims
court
had
found
against
you
on
that
point.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
claims
court
found
that
cheaper
insurance
was
not
available
to
three
of
the
people,
and
although
cheaper
insurance
had
been
available
to
the
fourth,
that
person
had
not
known
about
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
now,
these
are
respondents
that
were
testifying,
not
dissenters,
according
to
the
claims
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
that
mean
that
individual
members
could
have
received
back
the
dividends
that
went
to
charity
or
that
the
membership
as
a
whole
could
have
changed
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
would
that
affect
the
intent
to
give
or
the
donative
intent
of
individual
members?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
may
be,
but
i
don't
see
how
the
fact
that
the
membership
as
a
whole
could
have
changed
it
bears
one
way
or
the
other
on
the
motivation
of
the
particular
individual
you've
described.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
real
comparison
then
for
someone
wanting
to
save
money
would
have
been
to
have
the
bar
association
organize
the
same
thing
but
on
a
noncharitable
basis,
rather
than
go
to
some
other
insurance
company.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the
american
bar
endowment
insurance
had
not
been
designed
to
return
any
dividends
but
just
to
give
lawyers
the
insurance
protection
at
the
minimum
price,
that
would
have
been
more
favorable
than
the
way
it
was
set
up.
but
other
existing
programs
were
not
more
favorable.
