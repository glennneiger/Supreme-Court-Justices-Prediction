we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
united
states
against
the
american
bar
endowment.
mr.
lauber,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice

so
here
the
difference,
as
i
see...
maybe
this
isn't
right...
from
a
typical
program
is
that
the
dividends
are
all
committed
as
a,
they
say
as
a
gift.
of
course,
that's
your
second
issue.
but
is
it
not
fair
to
assume
that
if
they
didn't
have
that
condition
in
the
policy,
that
the
"earnings",
whether
you
call
them
earnings
or...
anyway,
the
revenues
of
the
endowment,
would
be
much
less?
i
mean,
just
talking
on
a
straight
business
basis.

e.
burger
mr.
gregory?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
lauber.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
