mr.
francis
m.
gregory,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
american
bar
endowment
insurance
program
is
today
what
it
has
always
been,
what
it
has
been
advertised
to
its
members
to
be,
and
most
importantly,
for
this
court
this
afternoon,
what
the
claims
court
of
the
united
states
found
it
to
be
and
what
the
federal
circuit
said
the
claims
court
was
correct
in
finding.
the
united
states
claims
court
found
as
a
fact
that
the
endowment's
insurance
plan
was
a
charitable,
fundraising
effort
under
which
members
of
the
endowment
received
insurance
but
knowingly,
voluntarily
and
acting
collectively
surrendered
to
the
endowment
for
charitable
purposes
because
they
wanted
to
do
so
approximately
the
same
amount
of
money
that
they
had
spent
for
insurance
over
the
last
30
years.
in
numbers,
the
endowment
has
received
$63
million
from
its
members.
the
claims
court
found
that
the
members
intended
this
program
to
work
as
it
did.
specifically,
the
claims
court
found...
and
this
goes
to
the
first
sentence
of
mr.
lauber's
argument
today...
that
the
dollars
we
are
talking
about
are
not
profits
from
a
business.
the
claims
court
found
as
fact,
and
the
federal
circuit
re-emphasized
it
at
least
three
times
in
its
opinion,
that
the
dividends
in
question
do
not
come
from
an
activity
that
constitutes
the
sale
of
goods
or
the
performance
of
services.
after
reviewing
in
detail
the
record
over
a
month's
trial,
25
witnesses,
3600
pages
of
testimony,
more
than
400-some-odd
exhibits,
the
claims
court
said
it
was
incredulous
to
find
that
lawyers
would
allow
their
association
to
exact
from
them,
to
force
them
to
pay...
and
this
is
the
position
of
the
solicitor
general,
although
we
didn't
hear
it
this
afternoon...
that
lawyers
would
allow
their
association
to
take
from
them
unwillingly,
and
frankly,
unwittingly,
100
percent
in
addition
to
what
they
would
have
had
to
pay
for
the
very
same
insurance
privately.
it's
a
finding
of
fact,
plain
and
simple,
and
we
invite
the
solicitor
general
to
address
that
point.
the
solicitor
general
suggests
that
there
are
four
reasons
why
the
group
gift
theory
of
the
endowment,
as
he
puts
it,
has
no
relevance.
let
me
respond
first
by
noting
that
virtually
everything
attributed
to
us,
both
in
the
brief
of
the
government,
in
its
reply
brief,
and
at
the
oral
argument
today,
is
not
our
theory,
it's
not
our
view;
we
are
simply
expressing
what
the
trial
court
found.
the
trial
court
found
the
facts.
it
found
that
the
dollars
do
not
come
from
the
sale
of
goods
or
performance
of
services.
it
specifically
found
that
it
was
the
intention
of
the
members
to
contribute
to
the
charitable
activities
of
the
bar.
let
me
quote
the
federal
circuit
at
appendix
12a
to
the
petition
for
certiorari.
in
the
present
case
the
claims
court
specifically
found
that
the
assignment
of
dividends
was
not
in
exchange
for
services,
but
rather
reflected
the
intention
of
the
membership
to
support
the
endowment's
charitable
activities.
mr.
francis
m.
gregory,
jr.
yes,
i
am,
justice
rehnquist?
mr.
francis
m.
gregory,
jr.
it's...
the
claims
court
opinion
is
to
be
found
commencing
at
page
2a
of
the
petition,
i
believe,
and
according
to
my
notes,
the
quote
is
at
12a.
i
direct
your
attention
to
the
footnote
on
12a
which
is
also
quoted
in
our
brief,
justice
rehnquist,
at
pages...
well,
the
whole
footnote
and
a
discussion
of
it
is
at
pages
21
to
23
of
our
brief.
about
ten
lines
up
from
the
bottom,
"in
the
present
case,
the
claims
court
specifically
found
that
the
assignment
of
dividends
was
not
an
exchange
for
services,
but
rather
reflected
the
intention
of
the
membership
to
support
the
endowment's
charitable
activities.
"
the
quotation,
or
excuse
me,
the
statement
was
put
into
the
footnote
at
this
particular
point
by
the
federal
circuit
to
illustrate,
to
illustrate
precisely
that
there
is
no
difference
between
the
plan
of
the
endowment
under
which
members
voluntarily
contribute
dividends
and
the
situation
hypothesized
by
mr.
lauber
whereby
the
endowment,
if
it
wanted
to
run
a
partially
as
distinguished
from
a
wholly
charitable
plan,
could
have
chosen
to
offer
to
refund
dividends,
footnote,
would
the
government
be
standing
by
saying
we
still
had
a
501(c)(3)
exemption,
if
we
did?
mr.
francis
m.
gregory,
jr.
it's
also
found
in
the
text,
justice
rehnquist,
and
if
i
could
read
what
the
claims
court
said
which
issued
the
initial
findings
of
fact,
this
is
page
41a
of
the
claims
court
opinion,
"it
is
quite
obvious,
then,
that
this
money
was
not
earned
from
the
sale
of
goods
or
the
performance
of
services,
but
for
some
other
reason.
"
"that
reason
was
the
intent
of
the
members
to
support
the
endowment's
charitable
activities.
"
in
the
text
of
the
federal
circuit
opinion,
the
court
said
that
the
claims
court
properly
found
facts
and
specifically
found
that
the
dollars
in
question
do
not
come
from
the
sale
of
goods
or
the
performance
of
services.
i
would
suggest,
justice
rehnquist,
that
the
two
opinions
below
cannot
be
read
in
any
manner
other
than
as
we
have
suggested
to
the
court
that
there
was
a
specific
finding
of
fact
after
looking
at
all
of
the
evidence
that
the
members
did
not
pay
for
an
exchange
of
services,
either
administrative
services
by
the
endowment
or
for
any
form
of
insurance.
they
didn't
have
to.
the
reason
is
quite
simple.
the
members
controlled
the
endowment.
the
government
has
suggested
time
and
again
in
its
briefs
and
at
oral
argument
that
the
endowment
has
exacted
or
taken
these
dividends.
that
is
not
the
finding
of
the
claims
court.
the
claims
court
said,
and
if
you
would
indulge
me,
i'd
like
to
quote
from
pages
38a
and
39a,
"the
final
and
most
telling
factor
is
that
the
insurance
program
was
operated
with
the
approval
and
consent
of
the
aba
membership.
"
continuing
a
bit
later
in
the
quote,
"most
professional
associations,
including
almost
all
bar
associations,
operate
such
programs
on
a
service-oriented
basis
and
secure
the
most
economical
group
insurance
for
their
members.
"
"if
the
aba
had
chosen
to
do
this,
it
could
have
offered
its
members
insurance
at
premiums
lower
than
any
other
bar
association,
perhaps
the
lowest
premiums
of
any
group
in
the
country.
"
"the
aba
members,
however,
have
chosen
a
more
generous
approach,
allowing
the
endowment,
rather
than
the
aba,
to
operate
the
insurance
program
and
retain
the
dividends.
"
now,
the
government
from
the
beginning
of
this
case,
has
taken
the
position
and
has
offered
the
factual
proposition
that
the
members
of
the
endowment
did
not
control
the
endowment.
we
tried
that
issue.
numerous
witnesses
testified
to
that
question.
the
court
considered
it.
the
court
made
a
specific
finding
of
fact
with
respect
to
membership
control
over
this
program.
again
i
would
respectfully
direct
the
court's
attention
to
pages
39a
and
40a,
also
from
the
claims
court
opinion.
i
should
also
note
that
you
find
in
the
appendix
of
the
petition
for
certiorari
only
the
written
opinion
of
the
claims
court.
in
our
brief
in
response
to
the
petition
we
noted
that
on
two
prior
occasions
the
claims
court
had
entered
substantial
and
lengthy
findings
of
fact.
you
will
find
them
at
the
end
of
volume
2
of
the
joint
appendix,
and
we
urge
that
they
be
read.
in
the
claims
court
opinion
the
court
said
"defendant
suggests
that
aba/abe
members
have
no
control
over
the
way
the
insurance
programs
are
operated
because
the
programs
are
maintained
in
their
present
form
by
an
unresponsive
leadership.
"
"the
court
finds
to
the
contrary.
"
"in
the
first
place,
there
is
nothing
to
suggest
that
aba/abe
leadership
is
unresponsive
to
the
wishes
of
the
members
they
represent.
"
later
in
the
same
paragraph
the
court
said,
and
i
quote,
"plaintiff
has
demonstrated
to
the
court's
satisfaction
that
there
are
ample,
effective
channels
within
the
aba
for
members
to
make
their
views
known
and
have
them
implemented.
"
i'd
like
to
pause
for
just
a
moment
to
talk
about
the
economics
of
this
program,
and
to
do
so
by
way
of
illustration.
there
is
no
question
again
that
the
findings
on
the
record
in
this
case
are
that
the
members
of
the
endowment
on
average,
over
30
years,
paid
two
times
for
insurance,
what
it
was
necessary
the
group
to
pay.
members
of
the
endowment
so
testified.
the
representatives
of
new
york
life
and
mutual
of
omaha
said
that
the
insurance
plan
was
available
quite
eagerly,
in
the
words,
i
believe,
of
the
new
york
life
representative,
at
any
time
the
bar
chose
to
take
it.
what
members
have
done,
to
illustrate,
is
to
pay
$200
for
$100
worth
of
insurance
and
services.
the
bar
rendered
the
minimal
services
of
being
a
group
administrator,
the
same
as
every
other
professional
association
renders,
again
made
clear
by
the
record,
and
more
importantly,
the
findings
of
fact
in
this
case.
the
claims
court
asked
itself,
as
it
parsed
the
statute,
why
did
lawyers
pay
$200
for
each
$100
of
insurance?
there
are
only
two
answers.
one
answer
is
that
posited
by
mr.
lauber
today,
and
not
simply
the
solicitor
general,
i
should
say.
it
has
been
the
theme
of
the
government
since
this
case
started
trial
in
october
of
1983.
the
government
says
that
the
misinformed,
the
timid
members
of
the
american
bar
association
have
been
bilked
by
their
association
and
tricked
into
paying
$200
for
each
$100
of
insurance
they
received.
there
is
no
other
logical
explanation
besides
a
charitable
motive.
the
claim--
mr.
francis
m.
gregory,
jr.
--i'm
arguing
both
parts
of
the
case,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
francis
m.
gregory,
jr.
to
this
extent
we
believe
that
the
cases
are
inseparable
as
to
this
fact.
the
claims
court
after
trial
said
i
do
not
accept
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
don't
accept
the
witnesses,
i
don't
accept
any
testimony.
i
find
that
the
credible
witnesses,
the
credible,
factual
position
is
that
the
members
of
the
bar
were
fully
informed.
the
members
of
the
bar
knew
that
they
were
paying
twice
as
much
for
insurance.
mr.
francis
m.
gregory,
jr.
the
court
of
claims
found
against
us,
justice
rehnquist,
not
because
it
had
any
disagreement
with
us
as
to
the
value
of
the
professional
association
group
insurance.
it
found
against
us
because
the
court
of
claims
adopted
what
the
federal
circuit
described,
we
believe
correctly,
as
a
narrow
test
for
determining
charitable
motivation
on
the
part
of
an
individual
member.
and
i
can
get
to
that
now
or
i
can
get
to
it--
mr.
francis
m.
gregory,
jr.
--well,
i
appreciate
the
question
because
as
to
this
fact,
we're
right
on
both
points,
and
we
think
it's
essential.
the
claims
court
said
i
don't
accept,
the
trial
judge,
the
explanation
that
members
are
misinformed.
i
specifically
reject
the
government's
position.
i
reject
the
government's
position
that
the
members
don't
control
the
endowment.
i
find
that
the
members
control
the
endowment.
because
the
members
were
well-informed,
because
the
members
controlled
the
endowment,
it
is
my
finding
that
the
endowment
has
not
received
dividends
because
of
the
rendition
of
services
or
the
sale
of
insurance;
it's
received
them
because
of
the
charitable
intentions
of
the
members.
let
me
turn
to
service,
insurance,
charitable
contribution.
all
that
the
endowment
has
done
for
30
years
is
the
very
same
activity
group,
other
association
group
insurance
plans
have
done
either
alone,
as
a
group
or
in
concert
with
third
party
administrators.
again,
the
record...
and
i
keep
going
back
to
the
record.
the
government
says
we
are
ships
passing
in
the
night.
we
didn't
pass
in
the
night
for
30
days
at
trial.
we
had
a
collision
at
sea,
and
findings
were
entered
after
that
trial.
the
value
of
the
services
rendered
by
the
endowment
in
this
case
were
miniscule
in
comparison
to
the
dividends
received,
approximately
five
to
seven
times
in
dividends
what
the
record
discloses
the
value
of
the
services
is.
indeed,
the
concededly
deductible
expenses
of
the
endowment
exceeded
the
value
of
the
services.
i
don't
believe
there's
any
question
about
that
on
the
record
as
well.
turning
to
group
insurance,
what
the
member
received.
the
member
received
professional
association
group
insurance.
professional
association
group
insurance
is
available
to
the
members
of
the
bar
at
net
cost.
net
cost
is
premiums,
less
dividends,
plus
the
attributable
expenses
of
the
endowment.
again,
i
don't
believe
there's
any
dispute
that
the
members
of
the
bar
at
any
time
they
chose...
and
they
control
the
endowment,
as
found
by
the
court...
could
have
chosen
to
have
insurance
for
everything
they
paid
except
the
dividends
that
went
to
charity.
they
could
have
taken
the
dividends,
returned
it
to
their
pockets,
tax-free
both
to
themselves
and
to
the
endowment.
the
government
in
looking
at
the
charitable
contribution...
and
to
some
extent
we
think
this
was
the
error
of
judge
kozinski
in
the
charitable
contribution
issue...
forgets
that
this
record
discloses
three
people
who
protested
this
plan
in
the
form
that
it
existed.
two
testified
at
trial
that
they
understood
that
it
was
a
charitable
program
but
they
would
have
preferred
that
it
be
run
at
a
cheaper
price
as
a
service
to
members
because
they
didn't
want
to
give
up
the
dividend.
one
person
was
referred
to
in
the
record
who
crossed
out
the
dividend.
it
was
not
caught
at
the
endowment
office.
the
dividend
was
refunded
to
him.
but
the
finding
of
fact
is
that
the
overwhelming
majority
of
the
members,
with
surprisingly
little
dissent,
and
i
believe
chief
judge
kozinski
said
a
handful
of
members
only,
objected
to
this
program.
the
government
won't
come
to
grips
with
the
fact
that
this
is
a
finding
of
fact,
that
the
vast
majority
of
the
members
wanted
this
program
to
work
precisely
as
it
did.
group
insurance
is
valued
by
well-known
principles
of
law.
it's
valued
by
fair
market
value.
what
was
the
fair
market
value
of
what
the
members
received.
fair
market
value
is--
mr.
francis
m.
gregory,
jr.
--certainly.
mr.
francis
m.
gregory,
jr.
the
record
reflects,
justice
stevens,
that
57,000
members
participated
in
the
plan.
the
membership
varied
at
times
during
the
years
in
issue
which
were
1979
to
'81,
but
it
was
no
more
than
300,000
members.
mr.
francis
m.
gregory,
jr.
i
believe
that
the
government
and
we
have
said
that
something
in
the
order
of
25
percent
or
perhaps
a
little
less
actually
participated,
but
chief
judge
kozinski
found
correctly
that
this
plan
was
kept
in
place
by
members
who
did
not
participate
as
well
as
those
who
did.
if
you
go
back
to
my
two
hundred/one
hundred
example,
if
it
were
possible
for
the
members
of
the
bar,
as
the
court
found,
to
get
insurance
for
$100
instead
of
the
$200
they
paid,
those
who
did
not
participate
made
an
economic
sacrifice
by
allowing
the
bar
to
operate
solely
a
charitable
fund.
turning
back
to
fair
market
value,
if
i
night,
of
insurance.
fair
market
value
is
objectively
determined.
if
you
look
at
the
regulations
under
section
61,
fair
market
value
is
the
price
at
which
a
willing
buyer
and
a
willing
seller,
each
having
knowledge
of
the
relevant
facts
and
neither
under
a
compulsion
to
buy
or
sell,
will
consummate
a
transaction.
let's
look
again
at
what
the
claims
court
found.
the
claims
court
found
that
the
members
were
fully
informed
as
to
the
program.
the
claims
court
found
that
new
york
life
and
mutual
of
omaha
would
have
provided
this
insurance
to
the
endowment
at
net
cost.
the
value
of
the
professional
association
group
insurance
is
what
it
would
have
cost,
what
it
could
have
cost
the
members
who
decided
to
pay
more.
that's
a
finding.
the
government
cannot
get
around
it.
the
members
decided
to
pay
$200
instead
of
$100,
but
that
decision,
the
decision
to
take
the
$100
dividend,
to
remove
it
from
the
pocket
where
it
could
have
gone
tax-free,
and
to
give
it
to
charity,
adds
nothing
to
the
fair
market
value
of
the
insurance.
mr.
francis
m.
gregory,
jr.
the
claims
court
found
against
us--
mr.
francis
m.
gregory,
jr.
--that
is...
that
is
correct,
justice
rehnquist,
looking
solely
at
that
particular
individual,
and
let
me
explain
what
we
perceive
the
error
of
the
claims
court
to
be
and
what
the
federal
circuit
said
it
was.
the
claims
court
found
that
there
were
a
handful
of
dissenters,
a
very,
very
few,
surprisingly
little
dissent
i
believe
is
the
quote.
mr.
francis
m.
gregory,
jr.
that
is
correct.
the
claims...
as
to
these
respondents,
there
was
no
testimony
in
the
record
as
to
what
other
insurance
plans
were
available
to
them.
at
trial
we
urged
a
prophylactic
rule,
if
you
will.
we
asked
the
claims
court,
after
it
finished
deciding
the
endowment's
case,
to
infer
charitable
motivation
on
the
part
of
each
individual
by
virtue
of
the
facts
found
with
respect
to
the
endowment's
case.
the
claims
court
said
we
will
not
make
that
inference.
i
find
it
necessary
to
look
member
by
member
as
to
whether
there
is
charitable
motivation.
the
claims
court
did
not
disagree
with
us
as
to
what
this
group
could
have
received
insurance
for.
it
said,
however,
and
the
federal
circuit
concluded
that
it
did
so
erroneously,
that
in
order
to
show
charitable
motivation,
you
have
to
show
that
you
bypassed
a
cheaper,
more
economical
insurance
product
in
order
to
participate
in
the
charitable
plan
of
the
endowment.
the
federal
circuit
reviewed
that
because
we
said
it
was
error.
on
appeal
we
again
said
that
on
the
unique
facts
of
this
case,
with
the
very
little
dissent
and
the
findings
that
it
made
on
knowledge,
control
and
value
of
the
insurance,
the
court
should
infer
uniform
charitable
motivation.
the
federal
circuit
declined
to
do
so.
again,
we
don't
contest
that
here.
but
what
the
federal
circuit
said
is
that
the
claims
court
has
focused
too
exclusively
and
two
narrowly
solely
on
the...
on
what
would
have
been
available
as
an
economic
choice.
while
this
is
relevant
in
the
total
calculus
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
test
that
is
appropriate
in
a
charitable
contribution
context,
it
is
too
narrow.
a
charitable
contribution
looks
not
only
at
what
was
economically
available
to
the
individual
at
a
particular
time,
it
looks
at
a
panoply
of
factors
concerning
motivation.
in
addition,
the
federal
circuit
pointed
out
that
we
find
somewhat
surprising
chief
judge
kozinski's
views
in
this
respect
since
he
didn't
take
into
account
the
fact
that
the
members,
if
they
chose
to
do
so,
could
have
acted
to
receive
back
the
dividends
that
went
to
charity.
he
disagreed
with
chief
judge
kozinski
as
to
the
precise
methodology,
the
federal
circuit
disagreed.
mr.
francis
m.
gregory,
jr.
the
membership
as
a
whole
could
have
changed
the
plan,
justice
rehnquist,
and
the
finding
is
that
the
membership
as
a
whole,
which
is
nothing
but
the
members,
chose
not
to
do
so.
mr.
francis
m.
gregory,
jr.
well,
let
me
give
you
an
example?
let
me
hypothesize
a
trial
concerning
a
charitable
contribution.
an
individual
comes
in.
the
individual
says
i've
been
a
member
of
the
insurance
plan
for
ten
years.
i
have
been
told
each
year
in
a
separate
envelope
that
i
have
paid
twice
as
much
for
this
plan
as
was
necessary
and
that
the
dollars
left
over,
my
dividends,
according
to
my
assignment,
have
gone
to
charity.
when
i
received
that
notice
i
said
to
myself
that's
fine.
i
prefer
it
this
way.
i
believe
that
this
is
appropriate.
i
am
pleased
as
a
member
of
the
bar
to
support
the
charitable
purposes
of
the
bar,
and
i'm
perfectly
happy
to
pay
the
$200
instead
of
the
$100.
we
think
that
is
an
eminent
illustration
of
charitable
motivation.
mr.
francis
m.
gregory,
jr.
well,
the
membership
as
a
whole
can
be
nothing
but
the
sum
total
of
the
members.
the
alternative,
justice
rehnquist,
is
to
posit
a
situation
where
99.9
percent
of
the
members
have
supported
this
program,
as
the
claims
court
found,
but
then
to
say
that
because
one-tenth
of
one
percent
objected,
no
member
can
come
in
and
say
i
support
it,
i
want
it,
and
therefore
i'm
entitled
to
a
charitable
contribution.
mr.
francis
m.
gregory,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
m.
gregory,
jr.
justice
stevens,
it's
often
stated
that
in
a
group
one
votes
with
his
feet.
mr.
francis
m.
gregory,
jr.
it's
both,
justice...
well,
it's
the
100
percent
of
the
american
bar
association,
justice
stevens.
mr.
francis
m.
gregory,
jr.
that's
what
the
government
said
at
trial,
but
the
claims
court
found
that
there
was
surprisingly
little
dissent,
three
people
of
record
out
of
57,000,
and
it
drew
the
inference
that
the
members
of
the
entire
organization
wanted
it
to
happen
this
way.
it
discussed
the
procedures
for
changing
policies
and
positions
of
the
american
bar,
and
it
concluded
that
if
a
significant
number
of
the
members
wanted
a
change,
that
issue
would
have
been
put
up
to
the
bar.
if
the
membership
chose
as
a
group
to
make
the
change,
it
would
have
been
changed.
the...
for
example,
there's
evidence
in
the
record
that
not
once,
not
once
at
an
annual
meeting
of
the
american
bar
association
or
of
the
american
bar
endowment
has
anyone
proposed
a
change.
if
the
will
of
the
80
percent,
to
take
your
numbers,
had
been
imposed
on
the
will
of
the
20,
it's
incredible
that
no
one
would
have
proposed
a
change--
mr.
francis
m.
gregory,
jr.
--well,
i
think
it
is,
justice
stevens.
mr.
francis
m.
gregory,
jr.
well,
i
think
if
you
look
at
our
brief,
which
i
know
you
have--
mr.
francis
m.
gregory,
jr.
--we
say
that.
i
mean,
people,
the
member...
the
member
who
chooses
to
take
the
insurance
makes
a
choice.
his
choice
is
not
to
take
the
insurance.
if
he
doesn't,
want
it,
he
can
go
somewhere
else.
mr.
francis
m.
gregory,
jr.
i
think
it's
an
individual
gift
made
possible
because
there
is
a
group
that
acting
together
can
obtain
this
lower
insurance.
mr.
francis
m.
gregory,
jr.
the
government
has
so
conceded,
and
we
think
they
have
conceded
the
case
because
of
the
findings
of
the
claims
court
which
we
commend
to
this
court,
that
that's
exactly
what
happened
here.
in
the
few
seconds
remaining
to
me--
mr.
francis
m.
gregory,
jr.
--yes,
justice
marshall.
mr.
francis
m.
gregory,
jr.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
testified
at
this
trial,
justice
marshall.
he's
a
former
president
of
both
the
aba
and
the
abe.
he
testified
that
any
member
may
appear
at
the
assembly
of
the
american
bar
association,
following
protocol,
giving
notice,
asking
that
a
matter
be
taken
up
by
the
assembly.
the
assembly
can
vote
on
it.
if
the
house
of
delegates
does
not
agree
with
the
assembly,
then
the
matter
is
put
to
a
mail
ballot
by
all
of
the
members
of
the
aba,
and
that
is
specifically
set
forth
in
the
testimony
in
the
case.
mr.
francis
m.
gregory,
jr.
well--
mr.
francis
m.
gregory,
jr.
--oh,
yes.
the...
mr.
reece
smith
testified
that
he
was
overruled
when
he
was
president
when
he
ruled
out
of
order
a
motion
to
commend
president
carter
for
supporting
the
controller's
strike.
it's
been
done.
i
cannot
give
you
the
specific
incident...
specific
incidents.
legislative
history,
the
legislative
history
referred
to
you
by
the
government
is
covered
in
our
brief.
it's
irrelevant.
congress
was
concerned
about
organizations
running
an
insurance
business.
the
claims
court
found
we
were
not
in
a
trade
or
business,
we
do
not
receive
money
from
the
sale
of
goods
or
the
performance,
of
services.
in
the
trade
association
cases,
let
me
leave
you
with
one
set
of
facts.
in
the
three
cases
referred
to
by
the
government,
the
percentage
of
premiums
received
by
these
associations
ranged
from
2
1/2
to
7
1/2
percent.
the
endowment
received
40,
50,
sometimes
90
percent
of
premiums
as
dividends.
both
courts
below
distinguished
those
cases,
noting
that
the
small
percentages
attributable
to
the
trade
associations
were
received
from
the
sale
of
goods
or
the
performance
of
services,
and
specifically
rejected
the
conclusion
that
the
members
of
the
bar
had
sat
back
for
30
years
and
allowed
the
endowment
to
receive
40,
50
or
90
percent.
in
conclusion,
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
this
is
a
charitable
program.
there
is
no
abuse.
the
members
of
the
bar
have
taken
dollars
that
they
could
have
returned
to
their
pockets
tax-free,
and
they
have
dedicated
it
to
charitable
purposes.
if
others
choose
to
do
the
same,
they
ought
to
be
encouraged.
that's
what
congress
meant
when
it
said
charitable
contributions
should
be
encouraged,
and
that's
why
a
deduction
is
available.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
thank
you.
