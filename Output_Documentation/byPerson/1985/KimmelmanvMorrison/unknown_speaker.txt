mr.
nodes,
was
there
ever
any
evidentiary
hearing
in
the
trial
court
as
to
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
seizure
and
that
sort
of
thing?
unknown
speaker
how
was
this
case
tried
in
state
court?
unknown
speaker
did
the
trial
judge
in
effect
make
a
finding,
or
at
least
expressed
in
some
way
the
harmless
error--
unknown
speaker
--would
you
say
that
he
characterized
that
evidence
as
cumulative?
unknown
speaker
did
the
trial
judge
characterize
it
in
essentially
that
way?
unknown
speaker
didn't
somewhere,
at
some
point,
he
express
the
view
that
without
that
evidence
he
would
have
reached
the
same
conclusion?
unknown
speaker
mr.
nodes,
there
was
an
admitted
violation
here,
wasn't
there?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
reason
why
a
warrant
wasn't
obtained?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
original
suggestion
that
it
is
harmless
error
because
the
trial
judge
at
the
hearing
before
the
appeal
indicated
that?
is
the
record
of
the
proceeding
when
the
request
for
a
bail-setting
appeal
was
made
in
the
printed
materials
before
us?
i
don't
seem
to
be
able
to--
unknown
speaker
--you
don't
know
whether
it
is
in
the
joint
appendix
or
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari?
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
in
the
regular
material?
unknown
speaker
let
me
also
ask
you
another
question,
because
i
may
not
have
the
case
properly
in
mind.
is
this
a
case
in
which
the
attorney
error,
he
just
made
a
mistake
on
this
particular
claim,
or
is
it
assumed
that
he
was
ineffective
in
his
total
responsibility
to
his
client?
unknown
speaker
is
it
not
correct
that
the
lower
courts
treated
it
as
though
the
ineffectiveness
in
this
regard
was
so
serious
that
it
violated
the
sixth
amendment.
it
wasn't
just...
or
am
i
wrong?
unknown
speaker
and
your
position
is
that
even
if
it
were
a
sixth
amendment
violation,
and
i
suppose
even
if
his
total
representation
was
ineffective,
that
still
he
can't
raise
this
point.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
supposing
there
were
two
things
he
did
wrong
instead
of
one,
and
he
said,
putting
those
two
together,
it
violates
the
sixth
amendment.
one
of
the
things
was
the
fourth
amendment
omission.
could
he
do
it
that
way?
unknown
speaker
what
you
are
saying
is,
if
the
only
evidence
of
ineffectiveness,
no
matter
how
serious
and
gross
it
may
have
been,
if
it
all
relates
to
the
fourth
amendment
claim,
it
is
barred
by
stone
against
powell.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
under
the
stone
v.
powell
inquiry,
yes,
i
would
say
that
that
is
correct.
under
stone
v.
powell--
--do
you
think
that
is
the
only
evidence
and
the
attorney
fails
to
move
for
its
exclusion
when
grounds
exist
to
exclude
it
that
that
would
never
amount
to
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
under
the
performance
standard
of
strickland?
unknown
speaker
did
either
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
say,
analyzing
the
performance
here
in
terms
of
the
strickland
versus
wainwright
or
washington,
whatever
that
case
name
is,
that
there
was
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
across
the
board?
unknown
speaker
was
there
an
evidentiary
hearing
in
the
district
court
on
this
fourth
amendment
question?
unknown
speaker
even
though
the
state
court
had
not
held
any
evidentiary
hearing
on
the
fourth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
the
ineffectiveness
claim
has
been
exhausted,
hasn't
it?
it
was
raised
in
the
appellate
courts
of
new
jersey?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
that...
but
it
only
went
to
the
intermediate
court,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
was
there
an
opinion
written
by
the
supreme
court?
unknown
speaker
so
the
only
opinion
we
have
is
of
the
intermediate
court.
unknown
speaker
that
court
didn't
seem
to
apply
a
farce
or
mockery
standard.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
that
isn't
what
the
intermediate
court
said.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you,
i
am
not
quite
sure
i
understand
the
thrust
of
the
wainwright
v.
sykes
argument.
it
is
clear
the
fourth
amendment
claim
is
procedural
default
as
to
that,
but
why
is
there
procedural
default
as
to
the
sixth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
position
that
the
attorney
at
the
trial
had
to
in
effect
challenge
his
own
failure
to
make
that
motion?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
how
you
can
say
it
is
procedural
default
when
the
intermediate
court
accepted
the
issue
and
decided
it.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
you
don't
need
that,
because
you
have
got
stone
against
powell
on
the
fourth
amendment
anyway.
unknown
speaker
and
what
was
it
that
they
failed
to
do
that
they
should
have
done?
unknown
speaker
the
default
was
the
failure
to
move
to
suppress
the
evidence.
unknown
speaker
and
that
bars
both
the
fourth
amendment
claim
and
the
sixth
amendment
claim,
even
though
the
man
who
failed
to
make
the
motion
is
the
one
who
is
claimed
to
be
incompetent.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
in
those
claims
you
are
not
claiming...
the
constitutional
claim
is
not
ineffectiveness
of
counsel.
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
then
that
there
may
be
some
kinds
of
default
that
would
enable
you
to
raise
what
is
an
effective
fourth
amendment
claim
in
the
federal
courts?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
the
logic
of
your
argument
is
that
stone
against
powell
said
that
because
of
the
peculiarities
of
the
fourth
amendment
exclusionary
rule
that
it
bars
trustworthy
evidence,
that
this
court
has
said
those
kinds
of
claims
are
going
to
have
to
be
litigated
in
the
state
courts
and
reviewed
here.
they
are
not
properly
federal
habeas,
and
it
seems
to
me
the
logic
of
that
is
that
there
can
never
be
a
defaulted
fourth
amendment
claim
in
the
state
courts
which
would
give
rise
to
anything
cognizable
in
federal
habeas.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
the
trial
judge's
statement
that
he
would
have
decided
the
case
the
same
way
without
the
evidence?
unknown
speaker
was
it
made
in
substance,
or
what
did
he
say
about
it?
you
tell
me
what
he
said
about
it.
unknown
speaker
tell
us
precisely,
if
you
are
going
to
tell
us,
give
it
verbatim.
unknown
speaker
what
else?
unknown
speaker
you
say
innocent
in
fact.
are
you
saying
there
was
something
wrong
with
the
bed
sheet
evidence
introduced
against
him
other
than
the
fact
that
it
was
wrongfully
seized?
unknown
speaker
it
is
pretty
clear
that
the
trial
judge,
the
trier
did
not
believe
him,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
didn't
the
district
court
in
this
case
issue
the
writ?
unknown
speaker
and
certainly
the
district
court
didn't
think
the
error
was
harmless.
unknown
speaker
neither
did
the
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
under
strickland.
unknown
speaker
why
are
you
making
this
argument?
unknown
speaker
it
sounds
like
you
are
asking
us
to
decide
whether
there
was
prejudice
under
the
strickland
test.
this
sounds
like
an
argument
you
ought
to
make
to
the
district
court
if
you
are
permitted
to
do
that.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
the
issue
in
the
case
is
whether
the
inquiry
should
be
made
at
all.
the
issue
here
is
whether
you
have
any
standing
in
federal
habeas
to
argue
this
ineffectiveness
issue.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
the
only
issue?
unknown
speaker
well,
one
can
just
as
surely
say
that
you
are
arguing
for
an
exception
to
this
court's
stone
against
powell
rule
covering
the
fourth
amendment.
i
mean,
the
two
are
kind
of
parallel.
it
is
a
question
of
which
one
prevails
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
that
new
jersey
did
not
afford
an
opportunity
for
full
and
fair
consideration
of
its
fourth
amendment
claim?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
answer
my
question?
unknown
speaker
you
are
saying
that
new
jersey
did
not
afford
a
fair
opportunity
for
hearing
this
fourth
amendment
claim.
unknown
speaker
couldn't
you
get
around
stone
against
powell
in
almost
any
case
that
way?
presumably
there
has
been...
you
have
lost
on
the
fourth
amendment
claim
in
the
state
court
systems,
sometimes
through
procedural
default,
sometimes
on
the
merits.
can't
you
always
come
back
and
say,
if
i
had
just
had
a
better
attorney
this
thing
wouldn't
have
happened
to
me?
therefore
you
convert
a
fourth
amendment
claim
into
a
sixth
amendment
claim.
unknown
speaker
then
wouldn't
that
result
pretty
much
in
a
system
where
the
state
court
trial
judges
were
really
not
capable
of
enforcing
their
own
state's
procedural
rules,
because
they
would
know
if
they
did
inevitably
the
claim
that
they
refused
to
decide
under
the
fourth
amendment
because
of
state
rules
would
be
decided
by
the
same
litigant
in
a
federal
court.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
contrary
to
the
provisions
of
the
new
jersey
rules.
unknown
speaker
what
would
be
the
good
cause
shown
here?
unknown
speaker
so
you
swallow
up
the
state--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
think
the
new
jersey
rule
that
requires
the
making
of
a
suppression
motion
within
30
days
after
the
plea
is
such
that
it
does
not
afford
a
defendant
a
fair
trial?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
claim
that
the
trial
counsel's
performance
was
incompetent
apart
from
the
failure
to
make
a
timely
motion
to
suppress?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
the
strickland
standard
normally
contemplates
a
focus
on
the
entire
performance
at
trial
rather
than
one
single
incident?
unknown
speaker
i
am
surprised
to
hear
you
say
that.
unknown
speaker
but
i
wanted
to
know
your
position.
unknown
speaker
did
the
district
court
view
his
performance
as
a
whole
in
making
its
determination
of
competence?
unknown
speaker
the
district
court
acted,
of
course,
before
strickland
had
been
handed
down.
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
not,
if
the
appropriate
focus
is
through
the
larger
lens
of
the
entire
performance.
unknown
speaker
one
difficulty,
of
course,
and
the
tension
that
is
in
this
case,
in
part,
comes
from
the
fact
that
stone
versus
powell,
i
guess,
rests
on
the
assumption
that
a
defendant
is
not
deprived
of
a
fair
trial
simply
because
reliable
evidence
could
have
been
kept
out
had
a
timely
motion
been
made.
i
guess
that
is
the
premise
of
stone
against
powell.
so,
it
is
a
little
hard
to
then
say,
well,
there
isn't
a
fair
trial
here
because
the
court
relied
upon
this
reliable
evidence.
