mr.
allan
j.

thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
defendant
in
this
case
is
in
custody
due
to
his
condition
for
the
rape
of
a
15-year-old
girl.
he
seeks
habeas
corpus
relief,
claiming
that
he
was
denied
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel
at
trial.
this
contention
is
based
on
a
fourth
amendment
claim
which
was
not
litigated
in
state
courts
due
to
a
procedural
default.
during
trial,
a
bed
sheet
which
has
been
obtained
from
defendant's
room
following
the
crime
was
introduced
into
evidence.
this
bed
sheet
contained
a
semen
stain
which
matched
defendant's
blood
type,
several
hairs
which
were
found
to
be
morphologically
similar
to
defendant's
hair
type,
and
a
single
head
hair
which
was
found
to
be
morphologically
similar
to
the
victim's
hair.
when
the
prosecution
entered
the
bed
sheet
into
evidence,
the
defense
counsel
for
the
first
time
at
trial
objected,
claiming
that
it
was
obtained
in
violation
of
his
fourth
amendment
rights.
since
this
motion
was
well
beyond
the
time
limits
allowed
by
new
jersey
court
rules,
and
in
fact
was
one
year
beyond
that
time
limit,
and
since
defendant
was
unable
to
demonstrate
good
cause
for
this
procedural
default,
the
trial
judge
did
not
entertain
the
motion.
new
jersey's
appellate
courts
affirmed
this
ruling,
and
in
addition
ruled
that
defendant
had
been
effectively
represented
by
counsel
at
trial.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
no,
your
honor,
there
was
not.
on
habeas
corpus,
the
district
judge
ruled
that
counsel's
actions
in
not
making
a
suppression
motion
in
this
case
were
below
the
normal
standards
of
competency.
in
addition,
he
ruled
that
had
a
suppression
motion
been
made
in
this
case,
the
evidence
would
have
been
excluded.
he
also
found,
contrary
to
the
findings
of
the
trial
judge
who
sat
as
a
finder
of
fact
in
this
case,
that
this
error,
if
any,
was
not
harmless.
we
believe
that
these
rulings
were
erroneous
and
improper.
we
believe
that
the
district
judge
erred
both
in
reaching
the
merits
of
the
fourth
amendment
claim
and
in
reaching
that
the
fourth
amendment
had
been
violated
in
this
case.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
this
was
a
bench
trial.
it
was
a
bench
trial
at
defendant's
specific
request.
so
the
trial
judge
sat
as
the
finder
of
fact
in
this
case.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
yes,
we
believe
he
did,
in
two
different
ways.
firstly,
at
trial,
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial,
prior
to
giving
his
verdict,
he
expressed
his
observations
of
the
case
and
gave
his
reasons
for
reaching
his
verdict.
at
that
time
he
spoke
only
of
the
credibility
of
the
defense
witnesses
and
the
prosecution
witnesses,
and
obviously
found
the
main
witness,
the
victim,
to
be
the
most
credible.
more
importantly,
at
a
bail
hearing
following
the
trial
at
which
the
trial
judge
was
required
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
any
good
cause
for
appeal
or
any
issue
on
which
defendant
could
prevail,
he
was
confronted
with
the
issue
concerning
the
bed
sheet,
and
he
ruled
that
this
bed
sheet
evidence
was
only
one
small
part
of
the
whole
case.
clearly,
if
he
did
not
believe
that
this
error
was
harmless,
knowing
that
a
suppression
issue,
a
sixth
amendment
and
a
suppression
issue
were
to
be
litigated
before
the
appellate
courts,
he
would
have
to
have
ruled
that
there
was
a
possibility
of
success
on
appeal.
he
said
that
there
wasn't
because
the--
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
--oh,
i
believe
that
this
evidence
was
either
cumulative
or
in
some
parts
not--
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
--he
compared.
i
don't
know
that
he
used
the
term
cumulative.
he
did
compare
the
evidence
such
as
the
semen
stain
found
on
the
bed
sheet
with
the
semen
stain
that
was
found
on
the
victim's
underwear.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
yes,
he
did
state,
i
think,
fairly
clearly
at
the
bail
hearing
after
stating
that
the
bed
sheet
evidence
was
only
one
small
part
of
the
whole
case,
he
did
state
that
the
main
evidence
in
the
case
was
the
credibility
evidence,
and
the
bedsheet
had
little
importance.
i
believe
that
it
is
clear
from
his
ruling
that
the
bed
sheet
evidence
was
cumulative
evidence,
and
that
that
was
his
feeling,
and
i
believe
that
that
is
demonstrated
also
by
his
findings
at
the
end
of
trial,
and
of
course
we
realize
he
was
not
required
to
make
those
findings,
but
he
did
at
some
length
explain
the
reasons
for
his
decision,
and
the
reasons
for
his
decision
were
based
almost
totally
on
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses.
he
simply
found
defendant's
witnesses
to
be
uncredible
and
the
victim
in
this
case
credible.
so,
introduction
of
this
evidence,
we
suggest,
was
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
we
do
believe
that
the
judge
erred
in
reaching
the
fourth
amendment
claim
because
by
reaching
the
merits
of
this
claim,
he
violated
this
court's
mandate
in
stone
versus
powell.
stone,
of
course,
precludes
federal
habeas
corpus
litigation
in
situations
in
which
defendant
has
had
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
litigate
a
fourth
amendment
issue
before
the
state
courts.
the
new
jersey
court
rules
provide
such
an
opportunity
to
every
criminal
defendant.
in
fact,
the
district
court
on
habeas
corpus
in
this
matter
found
that
petitioners'
petition
for
habeas
corpus
did
not
even
allege
that
he
was
denied
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
litigate
his
fourth
amendment
claim,
and
the
district
court
at
habeas
corpus
in
his
opinion
stated
that
if
such
a
contention
had
been
made,
it
would
have
been
totally
without
basis
in
fact.
to
allow
defendants
to
avoid
the
reasoning
behind
stone
v.
powell
by
phrasing
their
claim
in
sixth
amendment
terms
rather
than
fourth
amendment
terms
does
violence
to
the
reasoning
behind
that
opinion,
and
will
eliminate
the
benefits
of
finality
and
comity
which
that
opinion
was
intended
to
enhance.
stone
v.
powell
is
based
on
the
premise
that
deterrence
is
the
reason
for
the
exclusionary
rule,
and
that
if
states
provide
an
opportunity
to
litigate
fourth
amendment
claims
in
the
state
courts,
the
deterrent
potential
of
the
exclusionary
rule
will
be
fully
realized.
the
exclusionary
rule,
of
course,
is
not
intended
to
provide
a
personal
benefit
to
criminal
defendants,
but
to
discourage
police
misconduct.
therefore,
defendants
whose
suppression
motions
are
denied
cannot
claim
that
they
have
been
denied
a
personal
right,
but
only
that
society
has
not
received
whatever
deterrent
effect
suppression
in
their
case
might
have
cost.
this
court
found
in
stone
versus
powell
that
the
incremental
benefits
of
applying
fourth
amendment
law
and
exclusionary
rule
law
on
habeas
corpus
would
be
small.
thus
a
defendant
who
claims
that
he
was
denied
suppression
due
to
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
can
really
only
claim
that
society
has
been
denied
certain
minor
benefits
which
they
might
have
received
had
the
counsel
acted
differently.
he
still
stands
convicted
on
the
basis
of
highly
reliable
evidence,
and
as
in
this
case,
rarely
is
evidence
which
is
found
to
have
been
obtained
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
found
to
be
unreliable,
and
there
will
be
very
little
chance
of
an
unjust
conviction.
claims
of
this
type
are
really
fourth
amendment
claims
even
though
raised
under
the
sixth
amendment,
and
should
be
treated
as
such.
defendant
should
no
more
be
allowed
to
raise
fourth
amendment
claims
under
the
sixth
amendment
than
they
are
under
the
fourth
amendment.
we
suggest
that
this
is
particularly
true
in
cases
such
as
this
in
which
the
attorney
error,
if
any,
amounts
to
a
procedural
default
of
a
reasonable
state
rule.
in
other
situations,
attorney
error
or
miscalculation
concerning
the
law
or
the
facts
does
not
constitute
cause
under
the
first
crime
of
wainwright
v.
sykes.
in
a
number
of
cases,
including
reed
v.
ross,
this
court
has
noted
that
the
criminal
trial
process
is
extremely
complex,
and
if
the
system
is
to
run
efficiently
so
that
just
results
can
be
reached
in
criminal
trials,
it
is
necessary
that
the
states
enact
and
enforce
a
series
of
rules
and
procedures.
of
course,
if
these
rules
are
violated,
it
will
nearly
always
be
an
attorney
who
is
responsible
for
the
violation.
he
is
the
one
who
makes
the
objections.
he
is
the
one
who
makes
motions
in
cases.
he
will
almost
always
be
responsible.
if
a
criminal
defendant
is
allowed
to
excuse
the
violation
of
a
procedure
or
a
rule
simply
by
claiming
that
the
attorney
has
made
the
error,
or
attorney
responsibility,
there
will
be
no
way
to
enforce
the
rules
since
on
habeas
corpus
a
defendant
who
makes
that
type
of
claim
in
state
court
and
does
not
prevail
because
the
state
court
holds
its
own
rules,
will
be
able
to
claim
a
due
process
violation,
and
in
doing
so,
if
successful,
will
be
able
to
effectively
enforce
noncompliance
with
the
court
rules.
if
this
were
allowed,
we
believe
that
the
court
rules
would
become
meaningless
because
there
would
really
be
no
way
to
enforce
them
in
a
meaningful
way.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment?
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
we
believe
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
that
determination
can't
be
made.
the
state,
of
course...
there
was
no
hearing
held.
what
was
admitted
and
what
we
would
still
agree
is
that
the
record
in
this
case
does
not
demonstrate
a
reasonable
grounds
for
the
search
and
seizure,
but
there
was
no
suppression
hearing
in
this
case,
so
the
state
never
had
to
meet
its
burden.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
i
don't
know
the
reasons
why
a
warrant
wasn't
obtained,
and
i
wouldn't
want
to
make
any
statement
concerning
that,
because
we
simply
don't
have
that
in
the
record
in
this
case
at
all.
i
might
note
that
this
case
now
is
eight
years
old.
at
the
time
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding
was
held
the
case
was
six
years
old.
i
would
suggest
that
it
would
be
quite
a
bit
more
difficult
to
put
on
a
suppression
motion
and
find
out
that
the
motivations
of
the
officer
at
the
time
of
the
crime,
six
years
after
the
fact,
then
it
would
be
six
months
or
a
year
after
the
fact,
and
that
is
one
of
the
main
reasons
why
suppression
motions
are
normally
held
before
trial
and
why
in
new
jersey
the
requirement
is
that
a
suppression
motion
be
made
within
30
days
of
the
time
the
plea
is
entered.
we
simply
need
to
do
it,
especially
in
a
warrantless
situation,
at
a
time
when
memories
are
fresh.
but
i
can't
make
an
offer
of
proof
that
there
was
any
particular
reason
for
the
search
in
this
case.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
yes,
i
believe
it
is.
i
believe
that
was
in
the
materials
that
were
submitted
to
the
third
circuit
and
to
this
court.
i
will
check
on
that
and
ensure
that
you
have
that.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
i
don't
believe
that
we
placed
it
in
the
joint
appendix
or
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
most
of
the
record
we
submitted...
the
third
circuit
submitted
copies
to
this
court.
we
could
submit
additional
copies
immediately
if
the
court
would
like.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
no,
i
don't
believe
it
is
there.
we
do
not
believe
that
this
court's
rulings
require
the
effect
that
state
courts
be
unable
to
enforce
their
procedural
rules,
and
we
believe
that
this
is
one
of
the
primary
reasons
behind
decisions
such
as
wainwright
v.
sykes
and
such
as
engle
v.
isaac.
in
engle
v.
isaac,
for
instance,
it
was
clear
that
the
attorney
had
failed
to
make
an
objection,
and
he
failed
to
make
an
objection
on
the
basis
of
a
rule
which
many,
if
not
most
attorneys
would
have
known
about
at
the
time
when
the
objection
was
required.
still,
his
failure
not
to
make
that
objection
did
not
constitute
good
case
under
wainwright
v.
sykes.
in
effect,
the
wainwright
v.
sykes
line
of
cases
assumes
attorney
error,
but
still
requires
that
a
showing
of
cause
be
made
in
order
to
justify
procedural
defaults.
attorney
error
in
these
cases,
the
rule,
not
the
exception,
that
is
the
way
the
case
gets
to
the
level
where
a
wainwright
v.
sykes
determination
is
made
in
the
first
place.
if
it
were
not
the
rule
that
additional
cause
had
to
be
shown
in
this
type
of
a
situation,
we
suggest
that
the
cause
rule
in
wainwright
v.
sykes
would
simply
be
swallowed
up
by
the
exception.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
there
is
absolutely
no
inference
whatsoever
that
he
was
ineffective
in
any
respect
except
in
failing
to
make
the
exclusionary
motion.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
they
treated
this
one
error
as
if
it
were
a
sixth
amendment
violation.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
no.
we
don't
say
that
if
his
entire
representation
was
ineffective
that
he
couldn't
raise
this
point.
if
his
entire
representation
throughout
the
trial
were
ineffective,
this
might
be
one
of
many
points
that
would
be
raised
or
freely
considered.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
i
think
that
the
court
could
consider
the
effect
of
the
other
violation,
the
wainwright
type
violation
in
considering
whether
his
representation
throughout
the
trial
was
effective,
but
that
would
be
only
one
part
of
the
inquiry,
and
standing
alone
it
would
not
normally--
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
--yes.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
even
if
that
is
the
only
evidence
against
the
defendant.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
i
think
that
if
the
courts
were
willing
to
make
the
inquiry,
the
performance
standard
of
strickland
might
be
found
to
meet
it.
what
i
would
suggest
is
that
in
the
fourth
amendment
area
this
inquiry
should
not
be
made,
or
that
stone
v.
powell
would
lose
most
of
its
effect
if
such
an
inquiry
is
made.
stone
v.
powell
assumes,
as
most
cases
do,
that
most
fourth
amendment
evidence
is
highly
reliable
and
that
there
will
not
be
an
unjust
result
because
of
the
admission
of
this
reliable
evidence,
and
stone
v.
powell
relies
on
the
state
courts
to
make
determinations
concerning
fourth
amendment
motions.
we
believe
that
in
almost
any
fourth
amendment
situation
where
a
defendant
could
claim
that
the
trial
judge
erred
in
failing
to
exclude
evidence,
he
could
also
claim
that
his
attorney
erred
in
falling
to
properly
present
witnesses,
and
failing
to
properly
cross
examine,
and
failing
to
properly
bring
case
law
before
the
trial
judge
or
argue
the
case
before
the
trial
judge,
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
he
could
err
in
just
not
bringing
the
motion
itself.
we
believe
the
inquiries
into
the
attorney
performance
concerned
a
discretionary
motion
such
as
an
exclusionary
rule
motion
should
not
be
made
for
the
same
reason
as
we
don't
delve
into
the
reasons
for
excluding
evidence
in
a
normal
exclusionary
rule
context.
we
believe
that
the
state
courts
can
take
care
of
the
fourth
amendment
rules
as
well
as
the
district
courts
can
on
habeas
corpus,
and
that
that
is
sufficient
for
exclusionary
rule
purposes.
we
also
don't
believe
that
we
have
a
situation
here
where
we
normally
will
have
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
simply
because
of
the
elimination
of
this
type
of
evidence.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
the
district
court
did
not
rule
on
the
basis
of
strickland
versus
washington.
the
district
court
ruled
under
the
third
circuit
standard,
which
was
somewhat
easier
for
defendants
to
meet
than
strickland
is.
in
that
situation
the
trial
judge
ruled
that
the
error
was
not
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
however,
the
district
court
also
said
that
regardless
of
whether
the
third
circuit
standard
was
used
or
new
jersey's
farce
and
mockery
standard
were
used
in
this
case,
that
the
single
error
would
have
been
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
the
third
circuit
seemed
to
imply
that
the
conduct
was
professionally
unreasonable,
but
remanded
for
a
decision
on
the
strickland
issue
to
the
district
courts,
and
strickland
hadn't
been
decided
at
the
time
the
district
court
ruled.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
no,
there
was
no
evidentiary
hearing
on
the
fourth
amendment
contention.
the
district
court
reached
its
ruling
based
on
the
trial
record
in
this
case.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
that's
correct.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
yes.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
i
believe
that
that
was
raised
before
the
supreme
court,
hut
i
will
check
that.
i
believe
that
it
was
raised
on
the
petition
also.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
no,
the
supreme
court
simply
denied
certification.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
yes,
new
jersey
appellate--
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
--that
court
used
language
which
is
similar
to
the
language
used
by
this
court
in
strickland,
for
instance,
or
by
many
circuit
courts
prior
to
strickland,
talking
about
confidence.
the
district
court
found
that
it
had
in
fact
used
the
farce
and
mockery
standard
because
the
appellate
division
of
the
decision
refers
to
state
v.
edge,
a
new
jersey
supreme
court
case
in
which
the
farce
and
mockery
standard
was
announced.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
no,
that
isn't
precisely
what
they
said.
we
did
argue
for
the
farce
and
mockery
standard.
that
is
not
what
the
appellate
division
said.
on
the
wainwright
v.
sykes
issue,
we
would
suggest
that
the
caused
crime
has
not
been
met
in
this
case
because
it
is
very
clear
that
the
attorney
in
this
case
was
an
experienced
new
jersey
trial
lawyer
who
was
well
aware
of
new
jersey's
court
rules,
and
his
only
possible
error
in
this
case
was
in
the
miscalculation
of
the
possible
excludability
of
a
single
item
of
evidence.
we
don't
believe
that
this
can
meet
the
caused
crime
of
wainwright
v.
sykes,
a
single
error
of
this
type,
and
at
the
very
least
we
feel
that
a
review
of
the
entire
trial
would
be
necessary
in
a
situation
such
as
this
prior
to
overcoming
the
procedural
bar.
we
also
don't
believe
that
defendant
has
met
the
prejudice
crime
of
wainwright
v.
sykes
in
this
case.
really,
he
can
only
claim
that
he
was
convicted
on
the
basis
of
highly
reliable
and
highly
probative
evidence
which
he
hoped
to
keep
from
the
fact
finder
due
to
a
rule
which
was
intended
to
deter
police
generally,
not
to
provide
him
with
a
personal
right.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
i
believe
that
underlying
this...
i
believe
that
the
sixth
amendment
claim,
the
entire
sixth
amendment
claim
in
this
case
is
based
on
the
contention
that
the
attorney
made
an
error
in
not
making
the
motion
for
exclusion
at
the
proper
time
under
new
jersey's
court
rules.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
no,
i
believe
the
attorney
at
trial
gave
what
reasons
he
had
for
failing
to
make
the
motion
and
blaming
it
on
a
prosecution
incorrectly.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
well,
the
procedural
court
decided
the...
i
don't
believe
that
the
procedural
default
in
this
case
is
the
same
inquiry
as
the
sixth
amendment
inquiry.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
when
there
is
a
procedural
default
in
a
case
and
that
is
clear...
in
this
case
there
is
no
doubt
that
there
is
a
procedural
default--
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
--well,
i
believe
that
those
are
separate
inquiries,
and
if
we
have
stone
versus
powell,
that
would
take
care
of
the
first
part
of
it.
we
suggest
it
would
take
care
of
the
sixth
amendment
inquiry
also,
but
we
believe
that
on
the
procedural
default
line
of
cases,
there
was
definitely
a
procedural
default
in
this
case
such
as
would
normally--
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
--the
defense
counsel
made
his
motion
for
suppression
a
year
outside
the
time
which
was
allowed
by
the
new
york
and
new
jersey
courts.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
that's
correct.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
yes,
we
believe
so,
and
we
believe
so
because
in
almost
all
the
wainwright
v.
sykes
cases,
the
person
who
failed
to
take
the
action
is
always
going
to
be
the
defense
attorney.
in
wainwright
itself--
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
--well,
what
we
would
argue
is
that
the
final
result
in
each
of
the
wainwright
cases
would
not
turn
out
to
be
the
opposite
merely
by
also
saying,
and
the
sixth
amendment
was
also
violated.
we
don't
think
that
that
entire
line
of
cases
can
be
overruled
simply
by
writing
in
the
words
"sixth
amendment"
next
to
the
claim.
that
is
what
has
been
attempted
in
this
case.
there
is
an
admitted
procedural
default,
and
what
they
are
saying
is,
the
attorney
did
it.
what
we
say
is,
of
course
the
attorney
did
it.
in
the
procedural
default
cases
the
attorney
always
does
it,
and
that
doesn't
end
the
inquiry.
now,
we
don't
say
that
there
can
never
be
a
procedural
default
that
raises
to
the
level
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
we
agree
that
that
is
what
happened.
what
we
would
suggest
is
that
a
higher
standard
should
be
used,
and
the
defendant
should
have
to
show
that
his
counsel
was
grossly
incompetent
in
order
to
meet
the
caused
crime
of
wainwright
v.
sykes.
if
that
isn't
required,
the
wainwright
v.
sykes
line
of
cases
basically
will
not
be
effective
any
more,
and
the
court
rules--
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
--no.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
we
believe
that
that
is
correct.
we
believe
also
that
this
court
should
announce
that
stone
v.
powell
also
applies
to
sixth
amendment
claims
which
are
brought
concerning
solely
fourth
amendment
issues.
and
that
and
the
wainwright
v.
sykes
contention
are
the
main
bases
of
our
arguments.
i
would
save
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
