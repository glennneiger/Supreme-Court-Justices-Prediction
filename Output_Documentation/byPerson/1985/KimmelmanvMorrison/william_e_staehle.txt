mr.
william
e.
staehle
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
neil
morrison
was
not
convicted
fairly,
and
in
a
fair
trial
it
is
unlikely
that
he
could
be
convicted.
we
recognize
at
the
outset
that
the
best
we
can
do
in
federal
court
is
to
win
a
new
trial,
as
it
were,
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
as
issued
by
the
district
court
conditioned
upon
the
state's
right
to
retry
him.
mr.
william
e.
staehle
i
say,
your
honor,
that
that
statement
was
never
made
by
the
trial
judge.
mr.
william
e.
staehle
no,
it
was
not
even
made
in
substance.
there
was
no
such
finding.
he
said
the
following.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
case,
he
said
that
this
case
is
not
cut
and
dry,
and
he
went
on
to
give--
mr.
william
e.
staehle
--yes.
"cut
and
dry".
"not
cut
and
dry"
are
his
verbatim
words.
mr.
william
e.
staehle
and
then
he
went
on
to
give,
and
this
is
a
verbatim
word,
"some"
of
his
observations,
and
he
began
to
discuss
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses,
stopped
and
rendered
his
judgment.
on
the
motion
for
bail
pending
appeal,
he
indicated
that
the
bed
sheet
and
the
consequent
tests
were,
and
these
are
his
words,
"obviously
important",
and
then
he
went
on
to
say,
"but
it
is
one
small
part
of
the
whole
case."
and
in
denying
the
motion
for
bail
pending
appeal,
he
was
not
determining
a
sixth
amendment
question,
which
was
in
fact
being
raised
on
appeal.
he
was
not
determining
whether
or
not
defense
counsel
was
effective.
the
trial
judge
was
simply
determining
whether
he
was
in
his
rights
in
denying
defense
counsel's
belated
request
to
suppress
the
evidence,
and
clearly
under
new
jersey's
procedural
rules
he
was
within
his
rights,
and
he
was
so
bound
to
be
within
his
rights
by
the
appellate
court.
later,
mr.
chief
justice,
on
a
motion
for
post-conviction
relief,
wherein
it
was
determined
that
there
were
no
issues
to
decide
because
the
sixth
amendment
and
fourth
amendment
claims
have
been
in
effect
decided
by
the
intermediate
appellate
court.
a
statement
was
made
in
the
presence
of
the
trial
judge
that
the
bed
sheet
evidence,
as
i
refer
to
it,
was
a
major
point.
and
i
submit
that
the
trial
judge's
failure
to
make
any
comment
at
that
point
is
further
evidence,
although
not
the
greatest
evidence,
further
evidence
of
his
failing
to
find
that
it
was
cumulative,
and
cumulative
is
the
key
word.
we
would
expect
the
trial
judge
to
use
the
word
cumulative
if
in
fact
that
was
his
feeling,
and
at
no
time
was
that
word
ever
used.
so,
i
urge
the
court
at
the
outset
to
put
aside
the
notion
implicit
in
the
state's
argument
that
this
is
somehow
a
guilty
man
looking
to
get
off
on
a
technicality.
he
is
innocent
by
definition,
and
probably
innocent
in
fact.
mr.
william
e.
staehle
yes.
in
a
sense
i
am,
justice
rehnquist.
i
am
saying
that
the
effect
of
the
bed
sheet
evidence
served
to
undermine
his
credibility,
and
that
is
going
to
take
some
analysis
on
my
part,
if
i
may.
first,
when
we
speak
of
the
bed
sheet
evidence,
let
me
just
take
a
moment
and
clarify
what
we
mean.
we
mean,
of
course,
the
bed
sheet,
one
semen
stain
found
on
the
bed
sheet
correlating
with
his
blood
type,
his
head
hairs,
one
head
hair
from
the
victim,
and
no
hair
samples
which
matched...
no
hairs
which
matched
or
correlated
with
her
pubic
hair
samples.
so
the
absence
of
that
evidence,
i
think,
is
significant.
the
bed
sheet
evidence
undermined
his
credibility
because
it
forced
him
to
account
for
her
presence
on
his
bed
or,
more
specifically,
more
precisely,
her
presence
on
his
bed
sheet,
and
his
explanation
was
that
they
were
in
the
apartment
for
a
legitimate
purpose,
and
that
is
where
she
sat
down.
now,
in
order
to
believe
that
that
is
where
she
chose
to
sit,
we
have
to
make
two
assumptions.
mr.
william
e.
staehle
yes.
i
believe
that
this
case
turned
simply
on
the
credibility
of
the
victim
and
the
credibility...
or
the
alleged
victim
and
the
credibility
of
the
defendant,
and
it
was
the
bed
sheet
evidence,
i
submit,
that
served
to
undermine
his
credibility
because
if
we...
in
order
to
believe
his
explanation,
we
have
to
believe
that,
a,
she
chose
to
sit
on
a
stained
bed
sheet,
and
b,
we
have
to
assume
that...
well,
we
don't
know
what
her
alternatives
were.
we
have
to
assume
also
that
his
bed
was
simply
covered
with
this
stained
bed
sheet,
and
sometimes
an
explanation,
however
truthful,
is
inherently
unbelievable,
and
i
think
that
is
where
his
credibility
began
to
go
down
the
drain.
i
submit
that
there
is
further
prejudice--
mr.
william
e.
staehle
--the
district
court
issued
the
writ,
yes.
mr.
william
e.
staehle
the
district
court
certainly
did
not
think
that
the
error
was
harmless.
mr.
william
e.
staehle
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
determine
that,
but
remanded
for
a
prejudice
inquiry
under
strickland--
mr.
william
e.
staehle
--which
was
decided
between
the
decision
by
the
district
judge
and
the
determination
by
the
court
of
appeals.
i
submit
that
the
testimony,
the
defendant's
account
of
the
complainant's
sitting
on
his
bed
sheet
caused
him
further
prejudice,
something
that
he
would
not
have
had
to
account
for
and
probably
would
not
have
been
asked
to
account
for
in
the
absence
of
the
introduction
of
that
evidence.
it
caused
him
further
prejudice
because
if
the
trier
of
fact
assumes,
as
an
ordinary
person,
that
one
usually
changes
his
bed
sheet
from
time
to
time,
then
the
existence
of
a
semen
stain,
which
stain
correlated
with
mr.
morrison's
blood
type,
suggests
that
mr.
morrison
engaged
in
sexual
activity
on
that
sheet
recently
enough
for
the
stain
to
have
been
a
product
of
his
raping
the
complainant.
if
one
excludes
the
bed
sheet
evidence,
mr.
morrison's
testimony
is
plausible
and
internally
consistent.
mr.
william
e.
staehle
i
am
making
this
argument
with
respect
to
the
significance
of
the
bed
sheet.
now,
i
am
making
it
directly--
mr.
william
e.
staehle
--i
hope
to
be
permitted
to
do
that,
but
i
also
hope
that
this
court
will
in
fact
consider
the
prejudice
inquiry,
and
we
have
urged
the
court--
mr.
william
e.
staehle
--i
will
move
on
to
that
issue,
justice
white,
but
i
want
to
make
it
clear--
mr.
william
e.
staehle
--no,
the
writ
of
certiorari
was
not
limited,
and
the
issue
of
prejudice
was
briefed
by
both
sides,
and
so
it
is
for
that
reason
that
we
are
urging
this
court
to
find
that
under
the
strickland
prejudice
inquiry,
that
this
man
suffered
sufficient
prejudice
rather
than
to
simply
remand
it
to
the
district
court
for
that
determination
because
if
it
goes
back
to
the
district
court
it
is
not
because
we
are
not
confident
of
establishing
sufficient
prejudice
before
the
district
court,
but
by
the
time
the
lower
federal
courts
rule
on
it,
this
man
will
have
been
released
on
parole,
and
it
is
for
that
reason
that
we
seek
an
early
determination.
we
believe
this
court
has
the
information
with
which
to
make
that
determination.
we
urge
the
court
to
do
so
if
it
gets
to
that
point.
with
respect
to
the
initial
issue,
in
the
courts
of
the
state
of
new
jersey
mr.
morrison
received
neither
full
and
fair
consideration
of
his
fourth
amendment
claim
nor
full
and
fair
consideration
of
his
sixth
amendment
claim.
in
fact,
he
had
no
real
opportunity
for
such
consideration.
with
respect
to
the
fourth
amendment
claim,
the
state
technically
provided
and
provides
that
opportunity.
his
attorney,
however,
failed
to
take
advantage
of
that
opportunity,
and
mr.
morrison
was
therefore
powerless
to
avail
himself
of
the
state-provided
opportunity.
one
who
is
powerless...
an
opportunity
provided
to
one
who
is
powerless
to
take
advantage
of
it
is
no
opportunity
at
all.
and
it
is
that
which
we
read
the
stone
versus
powell
doctrine
to
turn
on.
the
opportunity
for
full
and
fair
consideration
and
ineffective,
constitutionally
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
cuts
off
that
opportunity.
with
respect
to
his
sixth
amendment
claim
which
was
raised
by
assigned
counsel
on
appeal,
his
having
been
represented
by
retained
counsel
at
trial,
the
state
court
failed
to
apply
the
proper
test.
it
is
for
the
first
time
today
that
i
hear
the
slightest
suggestion
that
the
standard
applied
by
the
appellate
division
of
the
state
of
new
jersey
somehow
was
in
accord
with
the
then
prevailing
federal
standard,
which
in
the
third
circuit
was
the
same
standard
as
that
announced
in
strickland,
namely,
the
normal
competency
standard.
and
i
think
it
is
clear,
and
it
has
been
until
the
suggestion
today,
that
the
appellate
court
applied
the
more
stringent
farce
or
mockery
standard,
citing
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
case
which
delineates
that
standard,
and
i
think
at
the
very
least
the
appellate
division
of
the
state
of
new
jersey
should
be
presumed
to
have
applied
the
law
in
effect
in
new
jersey
as
announced
by
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
at
the
time
of
its
decision,
and
that
was
simply
the
wrong
federal
standard.
so
there
was
no
full
and
fair
consideration
of
either
claim,
and
that
is
why
we
believe
it
is
appropriate
for
the
federal
courts
to
determine
his
rights.
in
essence
the
state's
argument
is
that
defense
counsel's
ineffectiveness
does
not
violate
the
sixth
amendment,
and
indeed
can
never
violate
the
sixth
amendment
so
long
as
the
ineffectiveness
was
limited
to
fourth
amendment
claims.
the
state
is
really
arguing
for
an
exception
to
the
sixth
amendment,
and
that
is
a
giant
step
which
we
urge
this
court
not
to
take.
mr.
william
e.
staehle
we
do
not
argue
for
an
exception
to
stone
versus
powell
because
we
read
stone
versus
powell,
justice
rehnquist,
as
requiring
an
opportunity
for
full
and
fair
consideration.
mr.
william
e.
staehle
we
are
saying
that
mr.
morrison
had
no
opportunity
for
full
and
fair
consideration.
mr.
william
e.
staehle
yes.
mr.
william
e.
staehle
new
jersey,
to
answer
your
question
directly,
technically
provided
that
opportunity,
but
mr.
morrison
was
powerless
to
take
advantage
of
that
opportunity
because
of
his
attorney's
ineffectiveness,
constitutional
ineffectiveness.
mr.
william
e.
staehle
the
short
answer
is,
that
can
always
be
alleged.
but
the
concern
of
stone
versus
powell
to
prevent
federal
courts
from
relitigating
or
redeciding
a
fourth
amendment
issue
as
a
practical
matter
is
not
going
to
occur
where
there
has
been
an
evidentiary
hearing
in
the
state
courts,
where
somehow
the
opportunity
has
been
seized.
i
don't
see
therefore
a
subsequent
claim
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
causing
the
federal
district
court
to
relitigate
the
fourth
amendment
issue.
it
is
only
where
there
has
been
a
complete
default
as
it
were
through
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
that
the
federal
court
would
then
be
in
a
position
of
either
determining
the
fourth
amendment
issue
or
somehow
sending
it
back
to
the
state
for
a
determination
at
the
state
court
level,
and
we
would
urge
that
it
would
be
proper
in
that
case
for
the
federal
court
to
decide
the
issue.
mr.
william
e.
staehle
it
may
be
decided
in
a
federal
court.
certainly
a
federal
court
might
first
choose
to
apply
the
prejudice
inquiry
and
determine
that
in
any
event
there
was
not
sufficient
prejudice,
and
might
never
reach
the
fourth
amendment
issue.
on
the
other
hand,
certainly
that
could
be
the
case.
a
federal
court
might,
but
not
in
every
case,
and
in
few
cases,
we
submit,
would
then
be
called
upon
to
actually
decide
the
fourth
amendment
question.
and
the
state
courts,
yes,
it
is
something
the
state
courts
would
have
to
deal
with
at
the
time
of
trial.
let's
take
this
case,
for
instance.
what
might
have
been
done
in
this
case
to
have
prevented
the
respondent
from
ever
getting
into
federal
court?
first
of
all,
it
being
a
bench
trial,
the
judge
could
have
held
a
hearing
without
inconvenience
to
anyone.
secondly--
mr.
william
e.
staehle
--the
new
jersey
rules
permit
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
trial
judge
for
good
cause
shown,
as
it
were,
to
hold
such
a
hearing.
and
i
submit,
your
honor,
that--
mr.
william
e.
staehle
--good
cause
shown
in
this
sense
may
very
well
have
been
that
there
is
a
breakdown
here
in
the
adversarial
process,
and
if
we
don't
decide
it,
then
it
is
likely
to
be
an
issue
on
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus,
and
we
may
be
in
fact
handing
the
ball
to
the
federal
courts.
that
might
have
been
in
a
sense--
mr.
william
e.
staehle
--i
submit,
secondly
i
think
there
is
a
responsibility
on
the
part
of
everyone,
the
trial
judge
and
the
prosecutor
included,
to
see
to
it
that
there
is
not
a
breakdown
in
the
adversarial
process,
to
see
to
it
that
there
is
a
fair
trial
afforded
to
a
defendant,
and
i
think
that
is
one
way
in
which
the
trial
judge
could
have
ensured
that.
mr.
william
e.
staehle
not
as
such.
no.
in
fact,
the
lack
of
a
fair
trial,
as
it
were,
could
never
be
attributed
directly
to
the
existence
of
such
a
rule,
or
at
least
certainly
we
are
not
contending
that
in
this
case.
the
lack
of
a
fair
trial
occurred
when
the
attorney
was
constitutionally
ineffective
in
taking
advantage
of
the--
mr.
william
e.
staehle
--no,
justice
o'connor.
there
is
no
suggestion
in
the
record
that--
mr.
william
e.
staehle
--i
do
not
read
the
strickland
performance
inquiry
to
focus
on
the
entire
representation
as
it
were
as
opposed
to
one
critical
element
of
the
trial.
mr.
william
e.
staehle
i
suppose--
mr.
william
e.
staehle
--well,
i
was
going
to
go
on
to
answer
that
slightly
differently.
a
defense
counsel
who
is
incompetent
with
respect
to
a
critical
element
of
the
trial,
which
then
passes
master
under
the
prejudice
inquiry,
i
believe,
in
a
very
real
sense
has
completely
let
down
his
client,
and
can
be
viewed
as
having
been
completely
incompetent.
i
don't
know
where
we
draw
the
line
between
fatally
incompetent
on
one
point
and
yet
somehow
overall
competent.
that
is
why
i
answered
it
as
i
did.
and
there
is
no
question
here
that
he...
in
the
application
of
the
performance
inquiry,
that
his
conduct
fell
below
the
standard
of
normal
competency.
mr.
william
e.
staehle
i
can't
say,
your
honor,
that
the
district
judge
expressly
did.
i
can't
say
that
the
judge
expressly
did.
i
can
say,
however--
mr.
william
e.
staehle
--yes.
but
the
performance
inquiry
was
the
same
as
that
later
enunciated
in
strickland
and--
mr.
william
e.
staehle
--the
court
of
appeals
also
viewed
its
standard
as
applied
by
the
district
court
as
conforming
to
the
strickland
performance
inquiry,
and
the
district
judge
found
not
only
was
defense
counsel
incompetent,
as
it
were,
under
the
normal
competency
standard,
but
also
under
the
farce
or
mockery
standard,
and
it
is
that
second
finding
which
leads
me
to
believe,
justice
o'connor,
that
the
district
judge
may
very
well
have
been
thinking
along
the
lines
that
the
entire
representation
was
flawed,
but
i
can't
go
so
far
as
to
represent
that
the
district
