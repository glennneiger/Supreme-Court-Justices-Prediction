unknown
speaker
mr.
gold,
before
you
get
into
the
substance
of
your
argument,
would
you
tell
me
which
paragraph
of
the
decree
imposes
the
quota?
unknown
speaker
you
quoted
several
paragraphs
in
your
reply
brief.
is
it
in
those
paragraphs?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
challenging
any
finding
that
there
was
deliberate
discrimination?
unknown
speaker
so
there
was
deliberate
discrimination?
unknown
speaker
and
a
remedy
was
called
for.
unknown
speaker
now,
what
was
wrong
with
the
remedy?
unknown
speaker
in
what
respect?
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
the
quota,
you
mean
the
29.3
percent.
unknown
speaker
anyway,
you
call
it
a
quota,
and
you
say
that
the
court
called
it
a
quota.
unknown
speaker
all
right,
so
that
is
one.
what
else?
unknown
speaker
do
you
make
any
claim
that...
similar
to
the
claim
the
united
states
makes
that
the
remedy
was
excessive
because
it
gave
remedies
to
people
other
than
victims?
unknown
speaker
was
that
part
of
your
argument?
unknown
speaker
if
they
have
passed
the
test.
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
see.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
regardless
of
how
they
are
graded
by
the
selection
board?
unknown
speaker
who
do
they
choose
first
on
the
white
list
and
who
do
they
choose
first
on
the
black
list?
is
it
by
grade?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but--
unknown
speaker
--but
they
rank
them.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
55
whites
who
they
believe
are
the
best
qualified.
unknown
speaker
and
similarly
with
the
blacks.
unknown
speaker
but
they
don't
compare
the
two
lists.
unknown
speaker
this
is
to
get
into
the
apprentice
program.
unknown
speaker
who
is
on
this
board?
are
they
union
people?
unknown
speaker
or
they
weren't
born
at
all.
unknown
speaker
why
hasn't
it
been
met
up
to
date?
because
45
percent,
allocating
45
percent
to
the
black
list
doesn't
augment
the
membership
fast
enough
to
get
to
the--
unknown
speaker
--but
you
are
not
free
to
put
any
more
than
45
percent
blacks
on
the
list?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gold,
before
you--
--how
is
the
29...
oh,
excuse
me.
before
you
leave
that
point,
mr.
gold,
is
one
of
the
paragraphs
to
which
you
called
my
attention
which
sets
forth
the
quota,
it
says
by
1981
it
had
to
be
met,
and
of
course
obviously
that
date
has
passed.
but
am
i
correct
that
none
of
the
contempt,
specific
findings
of
contempt
against
you
are
based
on
the
failure
to
achieve
the
quota?
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
but
whatever
he
found
you
in
contempt
for,
you
nevertheless
were
under
an
order
to
achieve
a
quota.
that
is
your
submission.
unknown
speaker
and
i
am
still
interested
in
knowing--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
you
say
the
figure
was
15
percent
now,
just
now?
unknown
speaker
again,
before
you
leave
it,
just
so
i
have
it
clear
in
my
mind,
is
there
another
paragraph
that
requires
that
the
quota
be
met
by
a
different
deadline
other
than
the--
unknown
speaker
--and
where
is
that?
unknown
speaker
and
then
my
second
question
is,
have
you
specifically
challenged
that
position
of
that
order?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gold,
one
of
the
things
raised
in
your
brief
has
to
do
with
the
order
setting
up
a
special
fund--
unknown
speaker
--for
use
in
connection
with
the
apprenticeship
program.
unknown
speaker
did
you
challenge
the
validity
of
the
fund
order
under
title
7
in
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
and
we
find
that
challenge
in
the
record
some
place?
unknown
speaker
now,
before
lunch,
you
were
talking
about
two
lists
from
which
applicants
are
accepted
for
the
program.
those
lists
ware
not
ordered
by
the
court,
were
they?
i
thought
those
were
voluntarily
structured
at
the
45
percent
level.
unknown
speaker
well,
at
least
the
second
circuit
said
that
the
defendant
had
voluntarily
set
up
the
45
percent
list.
unknown
speaker
how
is
the
term
"non-white"
defined
in
the
order?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gold,
have
you
answered
yet
the
question
why
you
had
not
achieved
the
goals?
he
has
given
one
reason.
so
you
can...
can
you
go
ahead?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
was
possible
with
extraordinary
reverse
discrimination,
as
you
call
it.
the
45
percent
you
set,
but
i
take
it
it
was
accepted
by
the
special
master
or
whatever
you
call
him,
the
administrator.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
you
say
it
was
inevitable
anyway,
and
so--
unknown
speaker
--so
the
remedy...
does
that
translate
into
an
assertion
that
a
satisfactory
remedy
was
impossible?
unknown
speaker
this
is
a
contempt
argument,
and
i
understand
that
is
part
of
your
argument,
but
that
isn't
much
of
a
title
7
argument.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gold,
excuse
me
for
interrupting
you.
unknown
speaker
i
have
a
question
or
two
that
may
not
be
relevant
but
as
a
matter
of
interest.
did
the
district
court's
order
require
any
member
of
the
union
to
be
laid
off?
unknown
speaker
in
what
way,
if
any,
did
the
order
of
the
district
court
discriminate
against
a
particular
member
of
the
union?
unknown
speaker
you
used
the
term
"reverse
discrimination".
i
would
like
to
identify
the
impact,
if
any,
on
individual
members
of
the
union.
unknown
speaker
who
are
not
in
the
union
already.
unknown
speaker
and
who
are
wanting
to
get
into
the
apprenticeship
program.
unknown
speaker
and
it
seems
to
me
i
read
in
one
of
the
briefs
that
existing
union
members
are
required
to
pay
for
the
apprentice
program.
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
who
pays
for
it?
unknown
speaker
they
pay
for
the
administrator,
too,
don't
they?
unknown
speaker
has
there
been
any
problem
about
the
availability
of
qualified
non-whites?
unknown
speaker
does
that
enter
into
the
achieving
15
percent
instead
of
29?
unknown
speaker
is
there
material
on
that
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
is
that
any
place--
--you
say
that
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
achieve
this
29
percent
under
any
circumstances.
unknown
speaker
into
the
apprentice
program.
unknown
speaker
didn't
you
run
the
apprentice
program
whether
the
construction
industry
was
on
the
boom
or
in
the--
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
29
percent
figure?
unknown
speaker
there
was
no
time
requirement--
unknown
speaker
--supposing
the
district
court
had
said
i
think
you
should
aim
for
29
percent
and
i
think
you
should...
i
am
going
to
order
you
to
attain
it
six
years
hence,
would
you
say
that
is
not
a
quota?
and
if
you
don't,
i
will
fine
you.
yes.
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
that
is
permissible?
unknown
speaker
was
that
permissible
for
the
district
court
to
do
under
your
view
of
706?
unknown
speaker
how
did
the
district
judge
come
to
29.23?
unknown
speaker
i
assumed
it
was
drawn
from
some
such,
but
the
fraction
seems
to
be
a
little
curious.
unknown
speaker
but
here
this
is
a
fluctuating...
the
market
is
fluctuating.
the
number
of
people
employed
at
a
given
time
is
fluctuating.
unknown
speaker
is
that
not
so?
unknown
speaker
but
anyway
the
figure
was
supposed
to
match
the
percentage
of
available
applicants
in
the
labor
market.
unknown
speaker
of
whatever
was
defined
as
minority.
unknown
speaker
did
the
plaintiffs
agree
to
the
45
percent
at
one
point
in
this
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
and
have
they
ever
asked
for
a
higher
percentage?
unknown
speaker
and
what
did--
unknown
speaker
--what
did
the
judge
say,
no?
unknown
speaker
would
one-to-one
have
attained
the
29
percent
goal,
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
any
more
than
45
percent?
a
little...
maybe
a
little
more.
unknown
speaker
but
they
were
still
under
an
order.
unknown
speaker
they
were
still
under
an
order
to
attain
that...
to
shoot
for
that
goal.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
union
had
complied
with
all
of
the
acts,
all
of
the
orders
that
they
had
been
held
in
contempt
for
disobeying,
would
there
have
been
any
greater
chance
of
achieving
the
goal
or
quota
or
whatever
you
call
it?
unknown
speaker
is
the
29
percent
union
membership
or
part
of
the
apprenticeship
program?
it
is
the
union
membership.
unknown
speaker
can
i
ask
you,
judge
winter
said
this,
and
i
am
sure
you
are
aware
of
it,
in
dissent:
"however,
in
light
of
the
facts
that
large
numbers
of
journeymen
did
not
work
during
the
period
in
question,
or
only
worked
meager
hours,
reactive
fingerpointing
at
local
28
is
faintly
camouflaged
holding
that
journeymen
should
have
been
replaced
by
minority
apprentices
on
a
strictly
racial
basis."
do
you
have
any
response
to
that?
unknown
speaker
one-to-four,
yes.
unknown
speaker
because
there
wasn't
any
work.
unknown
speaker
where
do
you
find
that?
unknown
speaker
you
think
that
restricts
706(g)
so
that
you
couldn't
require
the
discharge
of
non-minorities
to
hire
minorities
to
achieve
a
certain
goal?
unknown
speaker
you
think
congress
intended
not
to
permit
that.
unknown
speaker
based
on
the
legislative
history.
unknown
speaker
whose
statements
do
you
rely
on?
are
they
stated
in
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
is
fairly
authoritative?
unknown
speaker
mr.
sherwood,
do
you
think
your
view
of
706(g)
has
been
true
ever
since
1964,
or
do
you
think
it
was
enacted
in
1972?
unknown
speaker
so
you
don't
rely
on
anything
that
happened
in
1972
as
having
broadened
the
relief
that...
of
the
kind
you
are
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
well,
by
its
terms,
yes.
unknown
speaker
so
then
you
discount
a
good
deal
of
what
your
opponents
cite
as
legislative
history
to
the
1964
act,
the
statements
by
congressman
seller
and
people
like
that
that
we
are
not
authorizing
quotas,
and
we
are
not
having
any
of
that
sort
of
thing.
unknown
speaker
well,
some
of
them
referred
to
courts
ordering
this
sort
of
thing
as
a
kind
of
relief,
i
think.
unknown
speaker
because
that
would
violate
the
section
itself,
or
because
it
just
would
be
an
exorbitant
remedy,
or
both?
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
the
limits
of
706(g),
you
think
at
least
we
must
refer
to
the
legislative
history
for
guidance?
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
had
those
powers
specifically,
what
powers?
unknown
speaker
well,
except
discharging
non-minorities,
or
what?
unknown
speaker
where
do
you
get
that
limit
on
706(g)?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
did
the
union
draw
its
membership
only
from
new
york
city?
unknown
speaker
but
not
only?
unknown
speaker
mr.
sherwood,
on
page
14
of
the
petitioner's
brief,
in
their
summary
of
argument,
they
say
that
they
are
complaining
about
the
geographical
area.
unknown
speaker
they
complained
about
it
once
in
the
court
of
appeals.
and
this
is
the
same
case
that
originally
raised
it.
it
is
now
here
on
certiorari.
we
are
certainly
not
bound
by
what
the
court
of
appeals
said.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
lay
of
the
case
that
binds
this
court.
unknown
speaker
there
has
never
been
a
final
judgment
in
this
case,
so
it
can't
possibly
be
res
judicata.
unknown
speaker
is
this
not
the
same
case
that
was
litigated
ten
years
ago?
unknown
speaker
then
it
is
not
res
judicata.
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
these
people
never
took
this
issue
to
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
but
this
court
can
revise
any
part
of
this
case
that
came
along
if
it
was
once
taken
to
the
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
do
you
understand
the
difference?
unknown
speaker
well,
as
i
understand
it,
you
would
be
making
your
argument
here
on
whether
this...
even
if
you
agreed
that
it
was
a
goal--
unknown
speaker
--you
would
be
making
the
same
706(g)
argument.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
may.
unknown
speaker
the
one
point
that
worries
me
is,
this
whole
question
of
goals
was
established
in
a
case
that
you
didn't
bring
up
here.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
you
left
it
in
the
court
of
appeals,
didn't
you?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
you
didn't
apply
for
cert,
did
you?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
and
lawyers
are
expensive.
