mr.
martin
r.
gold
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
raises
the
long
history
of
the
desegregation
of
local
28
of
the
sheet
metal
workers
of
new
york.
this
process
of
desegregation
began
in
1964,
and
i
hope
to
demonstrate
to
you
that
it
was
essentially
completed
by
1975
in
the
sense
that
at
that
time
all
barriers
to
entrance
into
the
union
had
been
removed,
and
no
acts
of
discrimination
against
any
minority
persons
have
been
proved
since
that
time.
now,
since
1975,
however,
this
union
has
been
under
the
strictest
kind
of
court
order
involving
the
strongest
measures
of
affirmative
action.
those
have
included
a
29
percent
quota,
which
i
want
to
talk
about
at
some
length,
because
this
is
clearly
a
quota
case,
this
is
not
a
goal
case,
further
race
conscious
remedies,
and
total
loss
of
self-government.
now,
when
the
quota
was
not
achieved
by
the
deadline
which
was
fixed
by
the
district
court,
then
civil
contempt
remedies
were
imposed
upon
this
union,
and
as
a
result
of
the
fact
that
this
was
deemed
to
be
civil
contempt
and
not
criminal
contempt,
the
union
was
not
able
or
permitted
to
defend
itself
by
proving
that
it
had
not
acted
wilfully,
and
that
it
didn't
have
any
control
over
the
situation.
as
a
result
of
this,
a
strengthened
program
of
further
quotas
was
imposed,
more
race
conscious
remedies,
100
percent...
a
fund
to
be
used
100
percent
for
minorities,
and
which
cannot
in
any
way
be
used
to
benefit
white
people
at
all.
now,
i
hope
to
demonstrate
to
you
that
the
reverse
discrimination
in
this
case
is
beyond
all
boundaries.
it
is
beyond
the
boundaries
of
title
7.
it
is
beyond
what
congress
intended
and
set
forth
in
speech
after
speech
during
the
debates.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
it
is
the
decree
which
sets
forth...
it
is--
mr.
martin
r.
gold
--in
our
reply
brief
and
in
our
main
brief
we
set
forth
the
specific...
we
quoted
the
specific
paragraph.
i
don't
have
the
page
number
before
me.
we
have
got
1,000
pages
printed.
but
it
specifically...
the
original
quota
specifically
states
in
the
court's
decree
that
by
july
1,
1981,
the
quota
shall
be
achieved.
excuse
me.
i
do
have
it.
it
is
a305.
that
is
page
305
to
the
appendix
to
the
cert
petition,
i
believe.
now,
there
is
one
point
that
i
really
think
must
be
put
on
the
table
in
this
case.
many
people
who
look
at
this
case
seem
to
apply
a
presumption
to
it,
the
presumption
that
since
this
union
has
been
in
litigation
for
all
these
years
over
matters
pertaining
to
civil
rights,
the
presumption
is
that
they
must
be
bad
people,
and
some
of
the
language
which
has
been
used
particularly
in
the
amicus
briefs
goes
beyond
all
facts.
one
of
the
words
which
appears
over
and
over
again
is
egregious.
i
want
to
demonstrate
to
you
that
when
you
scratch
below
the
surface
here,
what
has
happened
is
quite
the
reverse.
this
union
has
really
been
forced
by
virtue
of
this
quota,
by
virtue
of
these
other...
to
engage
in
more
reverse
discrimination
than
has
been
permitted
in
any
case
that
i
know
about.
and
to
say
that
this
anion
is
a
bunch
of
bigots
who
will
go
to
any
extent
and
any
limit
to
avoid
taking
in
minorities
just
avoids
the
facts.
it
ignores
them
completely.
this
union
has
done
just
the
opposite.
as
a
result
of
what
has
been
imposed
upon
it,
this
union
has
taken
in
as
much,
as
many
minorities
as
possible,
and
continues
to
do
so.
they
have
gone
so
far
and
would
go
so
far
if
permitted
as
to
literally
put
up
a
sign
at
the
entrance
to
the
office
where
people
could
sign
up
for
the
apprentice
program
saying
"blacks
only
need
apply".
that
is
because
of
the
court
order
which
has
been
imposed
against
them.
now,
it
is
important
to
bear
in
mind
that
sheet
metal
workers
are
a
very
skilled
trade.
as
a
skilled
trade,
it
takes
a
sufficient...
it
takes
a
significant
amount
of
time
for
them
to
be
trained.
the
apprentice
program
is
four
years.
not
everyone
can
qualify
for
the
apprentice
program.
the
aptitude
test
that
has
been
given
for
a
good
period
of
time
now
under
the
supervision
of
the
courts'
offices
is
at
approximately
the
level
of
tenth
grade
math,
tenth
grade
english,
and
that
is
just
to
get
into
the
program.
now,
it
would
just
be
impossible,
and
no
one
is
claiming
otherwise,
to
simply
open
the
doors
and
permit
anyone
to
come
in
and
become
a
sheet
metal
worker.
it
is
as
if
you
wanted
to
do
the
same
thing
with
a
professional,
the
legal
profession
or
the
medical
profession,
and
suppose
a
determination
were
made
that
there
was
an
insufficient
percentage
of
minorities
in
those
professions,
and
the
federal
judge
said,
as
a
result
of
that,
we
are
going
to
integrate.
these
professions
are
going
to
start
to
accept
a
larger
percentage
of
minorities,
and
we
will
give
you
an
out
date,
and
by
that
date
a
percentage
has
to
be
achieved.
on
a
somewhat
lesser
scale,
that
is
what
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
no,
your
honor.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
your
honor,
i
began
by--
mr.
martin
r.
gold
--yes,
sir.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
what
was
wrong
with
the
remedy
was
that
it
went
beyond
what
title
7
permits.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
in
that
to
begin
with
it
contained
a
quota.
next--
mr.
martin
r.
gold
--well,
it
was
originally
29
percent.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
that
is
one.
the
next
is
the
total
loss
of
control
over
self-government
by
virtue
of
the
administrator,
and
the
others
are
a
variety
of
minor
provisions
in
the
order
and
judgment
and
the
affirmative
action
program...
that
is
seven
paragraphs
of
them...
which
direct
that
preferences
be
given
to
minorities
in
various
aspects
of
hiring.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
yes,
sir.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
that
is
part
of
our
argument,
your
honor.
but
we
go
beyond
that,
because
if
we
look
at
the
case,
if
you
telescope
it
to
look
for
a
moment
at
what
is
going
on
now
as
a
result
of
these
enhanced
and
magnified
orders
which
followed
the
contempt,
here
we
have
a
situation
now
where
the
last
acts
of
discrimination
that
anyone
has
proved
or
even
alleged
occurred
prior
to
1975,
and
nevertheless
as
as
result
of
these
orders
this
union
is
presently
maintaining
two
lists
of
young
people
who
are
applying
for
entrance
to
the
apprentice
program,
whites
and
non-whites,
and
when
a
person
comes
in
the
door,
we
have
to
put
him
on
one
list
or
another,
and
45
percent--
mr.
martin
r.
gold
--no
more
test.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
now
there
is
a
selection
board.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
and
45
percent
of
each
class
of
apprentices
is
now
minorities.
now,
who
we--
mr.
martin
r.
gold
--that's
right.
now,
who
are
we
discriminating
between?
these
are
not
the
victims
of
discrimination.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
there
are
no
tests
any
longer.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
there
is
a
selection
board,
and
what
the
selection
board
does
is,
it
goes
over
the
qualifications
of
all
of
these
people,
and
if
they--
mr.
martin
r.
gold
--yes.
they
are
going
to
take
100
people,
they
are
going
to
take
55
whites
and
45
non-whites.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
are
the
best
qualified.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
yes.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
they
don't
compare
the
two
lists.
if
they
compared
the
two
lists,
it
would
not
come
out
55-45.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
that's
right,
which
everybody
acknowledges
is
today
by
far
the
major
avenue
into
this
union.
but
the
result
of
what
has
happened
here
is,
who
are
these
people
that
want
to
be
admitted
now?
by
no
means
are
these
the
victims
of
past
discrimination.
you
can't
look
at
this
case
to
expand
that
meaning
in
any
way
and
come
to
that
position.
these
are
young
people
who
are
coming
into
the
work
force
who
are
about
18
years
old.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
no.
one
is
a
person...
we
have
several
boards
and
i
have
to
keep
them
straight.
i
believe
one
is
selected
by
the
plaintiffs,
that
is,
by
the
state,
the
city,
and
the
eeoc,
one
by
the
union,
and
one
by
the
administrator,
who
is
the
judge's
representative,
a
special
master.
now,
so
we
are
discriminating
between
these
young
people
who
at
the
time
of
the
last
acts
of
discrimination
that
have
been
proved
were
approximately
seven
years
old
at
most.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
or
maybe
some
of
them
weren't
born
at
all.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
this
is
going
on,
and
we
continue
to
be
forced
by
virtue
of
this
quota,
which
we
have
now
been
threatened...
our
very
existence
has
been
threatened
if
we
fail
to
meet
this
by
august
of
1987.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
by
no
means
could
it
possibly
do
it.
this
was
doomed
to
failure
from
the
first.
and
it
doesn't
make
any
mathematical
sense
to
have
thought
that
it
could
have
worked
from
the
beginning.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
at
the
moment,
we
are
not,
your
honor.
now,
we
have
tried
to
get
permission
to
put
more
than
45
percent
on
the
list.
right
after
the
original
decree
was
entered
in
1975,
the
problems
here
became
absolutely
apparent.
this
is
1975,
and
so
the--
mr.
martin
r.
gold
--thank
you.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
before
the
luncheon
recess,
justice
white
asked
me
why
it
was
that
during
this
period
from
1975
until
the
contempt
proceeding
was
filed
in
april
of
1982,
or
it
could
even
ask
further
until
this
very
day
why
has
this
membership
quota
of
29
percent
not
been
achieved,
and
that
is
an
important
question,
and
i
would
like
to
answer
it.
before
i
do
that,
i
would
like
to
tell
you
what
the
present
figures
are.
these
are
not
in
the
record
that
is
before
you,
but
they
are
filed
with
the
court
in
new
york,
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
and
i
think
that
the
court
can
take
notice
of
them.
the
present
figures,
the
total
membership
is
approximately
3,100
members,
and
the
overall
membership,
which
is
non-white
as
that
term
is
defined
in
this
case,
is
15.5
percent.
now--
mr.
martin
r.
gold
--well,
that
is
correct,
that
the
specifications
of
contempt
which
the
district
judge
found
against
us
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
did
not
contain
that.
the
notice
of
motion
to
hold
us
in
contempt
and
the
supporting
affidavits
by
the
attorneys
for
both
the
state
and
the
city
concentrated
upon
the
failure
to
achieve
the
quota.
that
was
the
primary
basis
of
their
motion.
the
court,
the
district
court
instead
said
he
is
not
finding
us
in
contempt
for
failing
to
achieve
a
quota,
underline
not,
and
said,
but
he
is
convinced
that
the
other
failures,
the
specifications
of
contempt
taken
together
made
it
impossible
for
other
reasons
we
didn't
achieve
the
quota.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
that's
correct.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
why
we
didn't.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
yes,
as
of
january
31
of
this
year.
now--
mr.
martin
r.
gold
--now
there
is,
your
honor.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
that
is
in
a
more
recent...
in
the
more
recent
order
which
emerges--
mr.
martin
r.
gold
--absolutely.
one
of
the
orders
which
is
on
direct
appeal
to
the
circuit
from
which
we
filed
this
cert
petition
is
the
order
which
slightly
altered
the
percentage
to
29.32
percent,
required
that
that
percentage
be
achieved
by
august
of
1987,
and
specifically
threatened
the
union
that
its
very
existence
would
be
in
jeopardy
by
fine,
by
extraordinary
fines
if
they
failed
to
achieve
it
by
that
date,
and
that
is
one
of
the
primary
orders
which
we
are
contesting
here.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
yes.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
the
specific...
there
was
a
direct
appeal
taken
from
that
order
itself
to
the
second
circuit,
and
the
second
circuit
specifically
dealt
with
it
on
that
basis.
i
don't
think
that
the
second
circuit
in
its
majority
opinion
went
into
any
analysis
as
to
that
order
being
valid
under
title
7,
but
it
was
clearly
what
they
considered,
and
that
is
evident
from
the
dissenting
opinion,
which
specifically
states
in
no
uncertain
terms
that
it
is
invalid
just
on
that
ground.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
well,
i
hardly
think
that
that
is
voluntary,
your
honor.
when
you
are
living
under
a
quota,
with
threats
of
the
nature
which
are
involved
in
this
case,
and
in
order
to
do
your
best
to
come
as
close
to
trying
to
comply
with
that
you
"voluntarily",
i
say
in
quotes,
engage
in
reverse
discrimination,
i
don't
regard
that
as
voluntary.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
the
majority
opinion
said
that,
your
honor,
and
that
was
their
basis
for
invalidating
a
specific
provision
in
the
newly
revised
affirmative
action
plan
creating
a
mandatory
one-to-one,
one
minority,
one
majority.
but
as
i
say,
that
is
hardly
voluntary.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
non-white
is
a
person
of...
a
negro
person
or
a
person
with
a
spanish
surname.
now,
where
did
that
definition
come
from?
it
came
from
the
original
complaint
filed
by
the
department
of
justice
in
1971,
in
which
they
defined
that
term
as
such.
the
definition
was
carried
forward
in
the
pretrial
order,
which
led
to
the
district
judge's
decisions.
it
has
been
carried
on
ever
since.
does
that
make
any
sense?
i
have
difficulty
with
it.
for
example,
this
union
now
has
a
reasonable
number
of
orientals.
those
orientals
are
counted
as
whites.
it
had
very
few
orientals,
if
any,
back
in
1964,
when
this
whole
business
began.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
well,
there
are
a
couple
of
reasons.
the
primary
reason
is
because
during
the
period
involved
there
were
extraordinary
economic
reversals
in
the
construction
industry
in
new
york,
of
which
this
onion
is
one
part.
i
am
sure
you
will
recall
that
during
just
this
period
from
1975
to
1980,
which
is
the
critical
period
here,
the
construction
industry
in
new
york
was
in
terrible
straits.
as
a
result,
the
membership
of
this
union
went
from
in
excess
of
3,000
members
to
approximately
2,000
members
during
that
period
of
time,
and
there
weren't
any
jobs
for
the
journeymen,
and
there
weren't
any
jobs
for
anybody
at
times
even
for
the
membership.
in
the
low
point
of
this,
42
percent
of
the
union
members
were
employed,
not
unemployed,
but
employed.
the
rest
of
them
were
all
unemployed.
there
just
wasn't
any
construction
going
on
in
new
york.
now,
at
that
time
how
is
it
possible
to
interest
anyone,
white
or
black
or
purple,
in
becoming
a
member
of
this
union
or
in
joining
this
business?
that
was
the
primary
problem.
but
i
think
that
this
failure
was
inevitable
anyway
without
the
most
extraordinary
kind
of
reverse
discrimination,
which
i
think
could
never
be
tolerated.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
it
was
accepted
by
the
plaintiffs
in
1981
as
well.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
and
the
union
had
done
it
voluntarily
before
that,
even
though
the
class
of
apprentices
had
been
very
small
as
a
result
of
the
economic
decline.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
yes,
i
think--
mr.
martin
r.
gold
--well,
i
think
that
calling
this
civil
contempt
just...
and
treating
it
the
way
the
district
court
did
just
mixed
up
civil
and
criminal
contempt
remedies.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
well,
i
am
not
sure
that
i
understand
your
question
then,
your
honor.
the
point
with
respect
to
the
contempt
is
this.
in
a
civil
contempt
situation,
the
purpose
of
it
is
to
coerce
somebody,
to
obey
an
order
which
is
yet
unobeyed.
that
is
the
primary
purpose.
in
fact,
as
i
read
section
1101,
which
is
the
contempt
section
under
the
civil
rights
act,
i
think
that
is
the
only
permissible
purpose.
that
is
the
only
basis
on
which
this
was
sustained
by
the
second
circuit.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
yes,
justice
powell.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
no,
your
honor.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
i
don't
think
that
it
did
discriminate
against
any
existing
member.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
i
think
that
the
impact
is
on
people
coming
into
the
union,
who
desire
to
come
into
the
union.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
yes.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
they
do,
your
honor,
as
they
pay
for
everything
else
that
is
going
on
here.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
they
pay
for
the
administrator.
the
administrator's
fees
as
of
the
end
of
november
had
been
close
to
$700,000
so
far
for
his
services.
he
has
been
involved
in
this
on
essentially
a
daily
basis
since
he
was
originally
appointed.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
absolutely,
your
honor.
that
is--
mr.
martin
r.
gold
--that
certainly
is
a
factor,
your
honor.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
there
is,
your
honor.
the
material,
we
didn't
print
it,
but
it
is
reports
that
indicate
that
smaller
percentages
of
non-whites
than
one
would
hope
had
passed
the
original...
had
passed
the
entrance
tests.
i
would
like
to
reserve--
mr.
martin
r.
gold
--yes.
the
only
way
that
this
could
have
been
achieved
is
if
there
was
an
extraordinary
boom
in
the
construction
industry
in
new
york,
and
at
the
same
time
the
union
essentially
said
we
are
only
going
to
take
blacks
or
close
to
only
blacks,
and
went
out
and--
mr.
martin
r.
gold
--into
the
apprentice
program.
now,
as
a
result--
mr.
martin
r.
gold
--we
did,
your
honor,
but
during
the
lean
years
there
were
just
a
small
number
of
apprentices
who
were
in
the
program.
many
who
joined
dropped
out
because
they
weren't
able
to
get
jobs.
it
is
a
four-year
apprentice
program,
and
during
that
period
of
time
people
have
to
work,
and
if
there
are
no
jobs
it
is
very
difficult
to
attract
or
keep
people.
i
would
like
to
reserve
a
few
moments...
a
few
minutes
at
the
end
of
my
time.
thank
you.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
one
of
the
problems
in
this
case
is
the
fact
that
i
believe
the
second
circuit
has
misunderstood
the
difference
between
quotas
and
goals
in
the
beginning
of
this
case
and
even
before.
the
difference
is
set
forth
on
page
9,
about
9
and
10
of
our
reply
brief.
and
it
comes
from
an
authoritarian
memorandum
which
was
issued
in
1973
by
the
eeoc,
the
department
of
justice,
the
civil
service
commission,
and
the
office
of
federal
contract
compliance.
those
are
the
agencies
which
have
federal
responsibility
for
enforcing
the
law
in
this
area.
there
are
really
three
elements
to
the
difference.
it
is
a
quota
if
it
is
a
fixed
number
or
percentage
which
must
be
achieved,
if
that
percentage
must
be
achieved
regardless
of
number
of
applicants
or
economic
circumstances,
and
if
there
are
sanctions
for
its
failure
to
reach
that
percentage.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
there
is
a
numerical
objective,
and
it
is
precatory,
it
is
subject
to
change
with
experience
and
it
is
not
subject
to
sanctions,
then
it
is
a
goal.
now,
the
second
circuit
adopted
a
different
test
in
the
rios
case
in
1973.
their
test
doesn't
look
at
any
of
those
criteria.
instead,
it
says...
it
looks
at
only
one
criterion,
and
that
is,
must
the
percentage
of
membership
be
maintained
after
it
is
attained.
in
other
words,
according
to
the
second
circuit,
if
there
is
an
order,
as
there
was
in
this
case,
directing
a
party
to
achieve
numerical
membership
of
x
percent
by
a
specific
date,
that
is
a
goal,
says
the
second
circuit.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
the
order
goes
further,
and
states
that
that
percentage
must
be
thereafter
maintained
at
that
level,
then
the
second
circuit
says
that
is
a
quota.
i
suggest
to
you
that
that
just
is
plain
wrong.
that
comes
from
the
rios
case
in
1973,
and
that
is
the
rule
that
the
second
circuit
was
enforcing
when
it
made
that
difference
in
this
case.
now,
the
various
circuits
that
have
looked
at
this
issue
all
said,
i
believe,
i
believe
every
one
of
them
says
that
quotas
are
no
good
and
goals
in
certain
circumstances
are
permissible.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
i
would,
your
honor.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
i
would,
your
honor,
absolutely.
i
don't
think
that
i
have
to
go
that
far
in
this
case.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
perhaps
i
may.
and
i
don't
think
that
goals
are
very
good,
either.
and
i
don't
think
that
they
are
permitted
under
706(g),
and
they
have
got
some
problems.
they
have
got
two
very
specific
problems.
one
is,
they
tend
to
degenerate
into
quotas
if
they
are
enforced
that
way,
and
second
is,
the
basic
assumption
for
them
seems
to
me
to
be
fallacious.
the
assumption
is
that
if
you
have
a
work
force
with
29
percent
of
a
certain
background
person,
that
in
the
absence
of
discrimination,
that
same
percentage
of
those
people
is
going
to
gravitate
to
each
occupation,
and
that
just
is
contrary
to
human
experience.
that
is
not
the
way
that
people
line
themselves
up.
now,
one
other
point
that
i
would
like
to
make,
mr.
sherwood--
mr.
martin
r.
gold
--but
we
didn't
bring
it?
mr.
martin
r.
gold
the
issue
was--
mr.
martin
r.
gold
--the
issue
of
goals
and
quotas?
mr.
martin
r.
gold
the
second
circuit,
which--
mr.
martin
r.
gold
--we
didn't
apply
for
cert
in
that--
mr.
martin
r.
gold
--i
wasn't
representing
this
party
at
that
time,
your
honor,
but
i
think
the
reason
that
people
don't
ask
for
cert
is
because
they
want
to
live
without
litigation
if
it
is
possible
rather
than
go
on
endlessly
if
it
proves
to
be
necessary.
mr.
martin
r.
gold
yes.
thank
you.
i
see
my
time
is--
