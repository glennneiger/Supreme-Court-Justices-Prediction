mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
listening
to
mr.
gold
this
morning
and
the
first
part
of
this
afternoon,
i
was
struck
by
his
characterization
of
the
condition
of
the
union
that
we
have
here
before
us
today.
i
would
think
that
neither
the
district
court
nor
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
recognized
the
union
in
its
supposed
compliance
as
described
by
mr.
gold
this
morning.
references
to
the
term
"egregious
conduct"
comes
not
so
much
from
the
amici
or
the
briefs
filed
by
the
respondents
but
rather
is
a
term
used
by
the
lower
courts
in
describing
the
conduct
of
this
union.
for
over
two
decades
the
courts
have
been
prodding
this
reluctant
union
towards
full
compliance
with
local,
state,
and
federal
laws
requiring
equality
of
opportunity
in
employment.
and
our
appearance
here
today
is
simply
the
latest
stop
along
that
arduous
road.
this
afternoon
i
want
to
focus
on
the
meaning
of
section
706(g)
as
it
relates
to
the
issues
that
are
before
the
court,
and
of
course
we
stand
on
all
of
the
arguments
that
we
make
in
our
brief.
initially,
i
want
to
state
briefly
our
position
regarding
section
706(g).
i
intend
to
respond
briefly
to
a
few
of
the
points
made
by
mr.
gold
this
morning
and
early
this
afternoon,
and
then
return
to
a
fuller
discussion
of
section
706(g).
to
the
extent
that
the
court
determines
that
it
should
address
the
reach
of
the
remedial
authority
of
district
courts
under
title
7,
it
is
our
position
that
section
706(g)
itself
gives
courts
broad
authority
to
grant
relief
that
realistically
will
work
to
fully
remedy
the
discrimination
that
it
has
found.
in
some
cases,
and
i
suggest
that
this
is
one
such
case,
that
includes
the
power
to
order
affirmative
race
conscious
relief
which
benefits
some
people
who
are
not
the
proven
victims
of
the
identified
discrimination.
imposition
of
a
per
se
rule
that
prevents
the
district
court
from
ordering
such
remedies
in
appropriate
cases
is
at
odds
with
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
itself.
as
is
evident
in
the
decision
to
the
courts
of
appeals
that
are
charged
with
responsibility
for
implementing
and
overseeing
implementation
of
the
statute,
such
a
rule
would
deprive
the
courts
of
the
needed
tools,
the
tools
they
need
in
order
to
carry
out
the
statute's
essential
purpose
of
rooting
out
identified
discrimination
and
its
effects.
we
believe,
however,
that
the
determination
of
whether
or
not
non-victim-specific
race-conscious
remedies
should
be
ordered
should
be
left
initially
to
the
discretion
of
the
district
courts.
that
is
the
scheme
that
congress
envisioned
when
it
enacted
and
amended
title
7.
of
course,
that
relief
should
be
tailored
to
cure
the
effects
of
the
identified
discrimination.
considerations
that
should
attend
that
determination
to
impose
prospective
race-conscious
remedies
have
already
been
suggested
by
this
court
in
webber
and
by
justice
powell's
opinion
in
fullilove.
they
include
the
efficacy
of
alternative
remedies,
the
planned
duration
of
the
remedy,
the
relationship
between
the
percentage
of
minority
workers
admitted
to
membership,
and
the
percentage
of
minority
group
members
in
the
relevant
labor
pool,
the
availability
of
waiver
provisions
if
the
hiring
plan
cannot
be
met,
and
the
effect
of
that
plan
on
third
parties.
regarding
a
number
of
the
points
that
mr.
gold
made
earlier,
i
would
like
to
just
make
a
few
comments.
one,
the
district
court's
order
here
does
not
impose
a
quota.
the
45
percent
number
that
mr.
gold
referred
to
is
one
selected
by
the
union.
what
the
district
court
has
ordered
in
this
case
is
that
the
union
move
with
dispatch
towards
overcoming
the
long
history
of
discrimination
that
it
has
practiced.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
the
29
percent
figure,
justice
rehnquist,
is
a
number
which
the
district
court
said
you
shall
move
ahead
with...
make
regular
and
substantial
progress,
and
those
are
the
words
the
court
used,
towards
getting
to
the
29
percent.
it
is
a
means
by
which
the
court
measured
how
long
it
would
closely
supervise
this
union's
progress
towards
integration.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
there
is
a
time
requirement
which
has
been,
incidentally,
reset
a
few
times
now.
the
court
recognized
early
on
that
conditions
beyond
the
control
of
the
union,
such
as
conditions
in
the
union,
might
require
adjustment,
and
the
court
has
done
so,
as
i
said,
on
two
occasions.
what
the
court
has
required,
and
it
has
said
so
in
several
places
in
the
record,
is
that
it
wants
the
union
to
move
ahead
and
move
ahead
with
dispatch.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
okay.
i
don't
want
to
debate
whether
we
are
talking
about
a
quota
or
a
goal,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
the
terms,
although
many
people
use
them,
don't...
doesn't
focus
in
precisely
on
the
concept
which
we
are
talking
about.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
but
let's
call
it
a
quota.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
i
believe
so,
yes.
the
district
court
could
do
what
it
has
ordered
in
this
case.
it
has--
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
--it
came
to
29.23
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
it
had
before
it
that
that
was
the
proportion
of...
the
proper
proportion
of
non-whites.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
that
was
the
result
of
the
particular
evidence
before
the
district
court
in
1982.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
the...
well,
certainly
the
number
of
people
in
the
market
may
fluctuate
er
time,
but
that
29.23
percent
was
fixed
in
1982
as
a
result
of,
yes,
a
change
in
the
relevant
labor
pool,
and
also,
and
most
importantly,
because
the
jurisdiction
of
the
union
had
changed
as
a
result
of
a
merger
of
other
unions
into
this
union.
there
was
a
proceeding
before
the
district
court
in
which
the
union
proposed
that
the
proper
end
goal
should
be
around
21
percent.
the
plaintiffs
in
the
case
asked
for
percentages
ranging
between
33
and
41
percent.
the
district
court
had
in
the
record
before
it
testimony
to
the
effect
that
the
proportion
of
non-whites
in
the
labor
market,
in
the
defined
labor
market
who
were
within
the
appropriate
age
ranges
was
29.23
percent,
and
that
is
where
the
number
came
from,
so
the
district
judge
picked
a
number
which
was
in
between
that
which
the
union
was
proposing
and
that
which
plaintiffs
were
proposing.
as
i
said,
the--
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
--in
the
labor
market.
that
is
correct.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
that's
correct,
and
that
was
based
on
the
evidence
that
was
before...
presented
to
the
district
judge.
mr.
gold
suggested
that
the
fund
sets
up
a
100
percent
quota
with
respect
to
those
items
that
are
addressed
in
that
particular
order.
i
should
point
out
that
the
district
court
made
quite
clear
that
the
union
was
free
if
it
chose
to
extend
those
kinds
of
benefits
to
whites
as
well,
but
the
court
was
not
going
to
itself
impose...
require
that
the
union
extend
those
benefits
to
white
individuals.
i
should
point
out,
too,
that
the
selection
board
that
selects
people
for
the
apprenticeship
program
are
all
union
members.
one
is
selected
by
the
administrator.
one
is
selected
by
the
plaintiffs,
and
one
is
designated
by
the
union,
but
they
are
all
members
of
local
28.
importantly...
i
think
it
is
important
to
recognize
precisely
what--
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
--the
plaintiffs
did
acquiesce
in
that.
yes,
justice
white.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
at
one
point
the
plaintiffs
sought
to
obtain
an
order
from
the
district
judge
for
a
one-to-one
ratio
for
placing
people
into
the
apprenticeship
program,
and
the
district
court--
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
--i
am
sorry.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
the
district
court
did
order
that,
but
the
court
of
appeals
stripped
that
portion
of
the
order
for
the
reason
that
since
the
union
was
voluntarily
indenturing
non-whites
at
45
percent,
there
was
no
need
for
that
kind
of
ratio.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
by
1986?
i
don't
think
so,
justice
white.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
i
don't
think
the
difference
is
significant,
but
i
think
it
is
important
to
remember
precisely
what
led
to
this
union
being
held
in
contempt.
they
were
not
held
in
contempt
for
not
meeting
the
29
percent
goal.
they
were
held
in
contempt
for
not
trying
particularly
hard.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
pardon?
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
yes,
that
is
correct,
but
that
is
precisely
it.
they
are
under
an
order
to
shoot
for
that
goal.
it
required
that
they
meet
the
29
percent.
it
currently
says
they
ought
to
meet
the
29
percent
by
the
middle
of
1986.
at
one
point
in
the
past
it
said
that
they
were
to
meet
it
by
the
middle
of
1981,
and
it
was
then
changed
to
1982
because
of
conditions
in
the
industry.
and
if
there
is
evidence
in
the
record--
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
--i
cannot
say
that
they
would
have
achieved
it.
i
can
say
with
certainty
that
they
would
have
been
much
further
along
the
road,
and
it
is
for
foot-dragging
that
they
were
held
in
contempt,
not
for
not
reaching
the
goal.
it
is
important,
too,
to
see
what
the
district
court
did
here.
the
district
court
ordered
the
union
to
not
artificially
close
down
the
size
of
the
apprenticeship
program,
and
it
is
in
order
to
provide
greater
opportunities
for
minorities
to
enter
into
the
trade,
and
also
to
limit
the
impact
of
the
court's
order
on
third
parties
who
are
seeking
to
enter
the--
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
--twenty-nine
percent
membership,
which
includes
both
journeymen
and
apprentices.
the
number
is...
they
are
lumped
together
for
purposes
of
making
that
calculation.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
there
is
nothing
in
the
court's
order
that
required
the
union
to
displace
journeymen
as
such.
the
standard
within
the
industry
was
generally,
and
this
isn't
a
strict
requirement
now,
that
there
be
a
ratio
of
apprentices
to
journeymen
on
roughly
a
one-to-four
basis.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
what
occurred
during
the
time
period
that
we
are
concerned
about
was
that
the
ratio
of
apprentices
to
journeymen
went
way
up.
in
some
shops
you
were
talking
about
one
in
22.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
and
because
the
union
kept
the
size
of
the
apprenticeship
program
very
low
as
compared
to
journeymen,
and
if
you
look
at
the
hours
worked
by
journeymen
during
that
period
of
time,
the
curb
goes
way
up.
again,
the
journeymen
increased
their
hours
during
that
time
period,
and
the
court,
given
that
kind
of
evidence,
concluded
that
what
the
union
was
about
was
shifting
work
from
apprentices
to
journeymen
to
the
disadvantage
of
and
in
violation
of
the
court's
order
requiring
that
it
move...
make
regular
and
substantial
effort
towards
integrating
its
membership.
mr.
gold
indicated
that
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
of
an
inadequate
number
of
minorities
applying
for
the
apprenticeship
program.
he
refers
to
the
fact
that
in
1981
the
union
indicated
that
minorities
were
not
doing
well
on
the
test.
the
reason
why
early
on
the
court
required
that
the
union
validate
its
selection
procedures,
the
union
elected
not
to
attempt
to
do
that.
and
so
the
bit
of
evidence
that
mr.
gold
is
referring
to
is
that
the
minorities
were
not
passing
this
invalidated
selection
procedure
that
the
union
had
been
using,
and
that
is
why
it
switched
from
using
this
paper
and
pencil
test
to
the
selection
board.
and
so
i
would
say
that
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
as
to
the
unavailability
of
qualified
non-whites
to
seeking
admission
into
the
union.
i
might
point
out
that
in
the
last
couple
of
years
the
rate
of
application
among
minorities
entering
in
this
union
seeking
application,
seeking
membership
in
the
union,
has
been
running
between
40
and
49,
50
percent
and
75
percent,
depending
on
which
particular
class
you
look
at.
returning
to
section
706(g)
itself.
the
provision
is
worded
broadly,
as
broadly
as
one
could
imagine.
it
authorizes
courts
upon
a
finding
of
unlawful
discrimination
to
order
such
affirmative
action
as
may
be
appropriate,
which
may
include
but
is
not
limited
to
reinstatement
and
so
on,
and
any
other
equitable
relief
as
the
court
deems
appropriate.
this
sentence
is
the
source
of
the
court's
power
to
award
race-conscious
relief
which
in
appropriate
cases
may
benefit
parsons
who
are
not
proven
victims
of
discrimination.
there
are,
however,
some
policy
choices
that
congress
built
into
the
statute
which
operate
to
guide
the
discretion
in
awarding
affirmative
relief.
one
of
those
choices
incorporated
into
the
last
sentence
of
section
706(g)
says
in
essence
that
a
court
should
not
require
an
employer
to
hire
a
particular
individual
who
chooses
not
to
hire
for
reasons
other
than
unlawful
discrimination.
the
remedy
which
a
particular
individual
may
demand
for
himself
is
restricted
to
make
whole
relief.
he
doesn't
require
the
right
to
employment
simply
because
the
employer
was
found
guilty
of
discriminating
against
the
group
of
which
he
is
a
member.
another
policy
choice
is
that
the
statute
is
prospective
in
its
application.
it
doesn't
require
the
removal
of
employees
who
are
hired
as
a
result
of
the
prior
discrimination.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
we
find
that
only
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
where
there
is--
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
--that
is
what
congress
in
enacting
the
statute--
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
--that
is
what
i
understood
congress
to--
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
--based
on
the
legislative
history.
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
statute
itself
that
says
that.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
i
believe
we
may
have
mentioned
it
in
our
brief.
what
comes
to
mind
is
senator
clark
and
case's
memorandum
which
refers
to
when
the
statute--
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
--it
is
one
of
the
authorities
that
is
important.
all
i
am
saying
with
respect
to
that,
however,
is
that
it
says
that
we
are
giving
a
one-year
delay
before
the
statute
comes
into
effect,
and
it
makes
reference
to
the
fact
that
the
statute
is
prospective,
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
that
requires...
that
says
that
one
could
not
hire
or
discharge
individuals
who
were
hired
because
of
discrimination.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
no,
i
believe
it
has
been
true
since
1964.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
well,
certainly
the
1972
amendment
has
broadened
section
706(g).
there
is
no
question
about
that.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
by
its
terms,
but
it
was
not
necessary
for
the
congress
in
1972
to
broaden
the
statute
as
it
did
in
order
for
courts
to
award
the
kind
of
relief
that
we
are
talking
about
here.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
congress
in
those
statements
were
referring
to
and
giving
assurances
to
individuals
who
believe
that
this
statute
if
enacted
would
require
employers
across
the
nation
to
achieve
or
maintain
racial
balance.
that
is
what
those
statements--
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
--indeed,
courts
can't
enter
an
order
that
would
maintain
a
racial
balance,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
once
the
court
has
remedied
discrimination,
and
it
may
include
the
use
of...
in
getting
to
full
compliance,
that
may
include
the
use
of
goals
and
other
race
conscious
means.
having
done
that,
and
having
fully
remedied
discrimination,
a
court
order
could
not
then
go
on
and
require
that
the
employer
maintain
any
particular
racial
balance.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
because
it
would
no
longer
be
remedial
at
that
point.
but
there
is
no
specific
words
in
section
706(g)
that
say
a
court
may
not
maintain--
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
--i
think
you
don't
have
to
look
to
the
legislative
history
for
the
purposes
of
this
case.
we
can
decide
this
case
on
the
basis
of
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
itself.
there
is
no
need
to
look
to
the
legislative
history
for
any
of
the
issues
that
are
before
us
here.
in
some
other
factual
contexts,
perhaps
there
may
be
some
need
to
look
at
the
legislative
history,
but
given
this
particular
case
and
its
facts,
i
think
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
itself
is
all
that
is
required.
and
indeed
if
one
looks
at
the
decisions
of
the
courts
of
appeals
and
the
consistent
actions
of
the
federal
agencies
that
are
responsible
for
enforcing
title
7,
following
the
enactment
of
the
1964
act,
you
would
see
that
those
agencies
and
those
courts
recognize
that
the
courts
had
the
power
that
i
suggest
that
it
has.
indeed,
in
1972,
when
congress
was
amending
the
law,
it
recognized
that
the
courts
already
had
those
powers,
and
that
appears
quite
clearly
in
comments
from
senator
javits
and
others.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
the
power
to
order
whatever
relief
realistically
would
work
in
order
to
remedy
completely
the
identified
discrimination
that
had
been
found.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
with
respect
to
discharging
non-minorities,
again--
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
--it
has...
it
comes
out
of...
the
only
place
that
i
see
is
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
'64
act.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
but
not
in
section
706(g)
itself.
what
congress
did
in
1964
is
recognize
the
broad
equitable
powers
of
district
courts
to
order
whatever
relief
would
work,
and
the
district
courts
following
1964
have
found
that
in
order
to
fully
remedy
discrimination,
it
was
necessary
to
have
in
appropriate
cases
the
kinds
of
remedies
that
may
extend
to
individuals
who
are
not
already
the
proven
victims
of
discrimination.
certainly
the
district
court's...
whether
the
district
court
orders
race-conscious
remedies
in
a
given
case,
depends
on
the
particular
facts,
and
questions,
considerations
that
would
go
into
that
determination
should
include
whether
or
not
other
means
that
are
available
to
the
district
court
would
be
effective
to
carry
out
that
purpose.
questions
regarding
whether
or
not...
how
long...
the
duration
of
the
program.
certainly
once
the
discrimination
is
remedied
completely,
there
is
no
need
to
continue
to
use
those
specific
race-conscious
means.
and
so
in
that
sense
the
program
would
necessarily
be
temporary.
the
end
goal
should
be
properly
fixed,
and
a
way
of
determining
that
is
seeing
what
condition
this
particular,
in
this
case,
this
particular
union
would
have
been
in
absent
discrimination.
one
would
have
expected
in
this
case
that
the
non-white
membership
of
this
union
would
be
somewhere
around
29
percent
had
it
not
been
guilty
of
discrimination.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
principally.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
but
not
only.
some
of
its
members
did
live
outside
new
york
city.
that
question
was
raised
in
the
very
first
appeal
in
this
case
as
to
the
appropriate
scope
of
the...
the
appropriate
dimension
or
scope
of
the
labor
market.
i
should
point
out
that
no
issues
have
been
raised
with
respect
to
that
particular
question,
the
scope
of
the
labor
market
on
this
appeal.
it
is
a
matter
that
was
raised
and
resolved
a
decade
ago,
and
no
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
was
sought
at
that
time.
of
course,
the
degree
of
flexibility
that
should
go
into
the
fashioning
of
any
particular
plan
is
a
matter
that
ought
to
be
considered
as
well.
i
think
the
district
court
did
precisely
that
in
this
case.
and
finally,
the
incidental
effects
that
the
program
may
have
on
others
should
be
considered.
what
the
district
court
did
in
this
case
was
to
require
that
the
union
maintain
an
apprenticeship
program
of
adequate
size,
realistically
fixed
in
terms
of
the
availability
of
work
within
the
industry
so
that
there
would
be
a
scream
of
minorities
and
non-minorities
entering
into
full
membership
in
the
union.
it
is
that
problem,
the
problem
of
constricting
the
size
of
the
apprenticeship
program
itself,
that
has
been
a
repeated
problem
in
this
case.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
they
are
saying
that
now.
all
i
am
saying,
justice
rehnquist,
is
that
they
did
not
complain
about
that
in
the
court
of
appeals.
that
is
something--
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
--they
raised
it...
are
you
referring
to
when
they
raised
it
ten
years
ago?
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
certainly
they
raised
it--
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
--we
are
not
suggesting
that
law
of
the
case
applies
here.
what
we
say
applies
here
with
respect
to
that
issue
is
res
judicata.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
there
certainly
has
been
a
final
judgment.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
yes.
this
is
the
same--
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
--as
i
understand
the
principle
of
res
judicata,
once
a
case
has
been
tried,
and
tried
to
judgment,
and
there
has
been
the
opportunity
to
appeal,
and
the
90
days
that
one
gets
in
order
to
seek
certiorari
in
this
cases
passes,
that
is--
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
--they
took
it
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
1976.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
my
understanding
of
res
judicata
is
that
once
the
time
to
appeal
is
over,
following
a
trial
on
the
merits,
that
after
the
time
to
appeal
has
expired,
that
is
it,
even
if
the
court
continues
to
maintain
jurisdiction
over
the
case.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
fair
enough.
i
see
that
my
time
is
up.
