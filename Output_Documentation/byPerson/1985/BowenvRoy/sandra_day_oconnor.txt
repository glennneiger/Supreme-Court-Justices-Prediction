justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
geller,
the
court
below
found
that
the
claim
was
based
on
a
sincere
religious
belief.
your
comments
suggest
that
you
think
that
that
might
not
be
the
case.
do
you
concede
that
it
was
the
product
of
a
sincere
religious
belief?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
challenge
in
this
court
the
finding
of
the
district
court:
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
geller,
didn't
the
court's
findings
below
say
that
exempting
little
bird
of
the
snow
from
use
of
the
social
security
requirement
could
be
accomplished
in
this
case
without
any
increased
expenditures
to
the
government
and
could
be
done
effectively?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
say
that
is
the
wrong
test.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
certainly
language
in
sherbert
against
werner
and
thomas
against
the
review
board
cut
in
the
direction
of
making
an
individual--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
isn't
that
what
the
court
here
said?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
geller,
regardless
of
that
argument,
the
district
court
did
find
that
the
government's
interest
in
preventing
little
bird
of
the
snow
from
fraudulently
receiving
welfare
benefits
can
be
satisfied
without
requiring
use
of
her
social
security
number.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
was
one
of
its
findings
in--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--number
77.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
was
simply
reading
from
one
of
its
findings.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
geller,
do
you
think
that
administrative
efficiency
in
every
case
must
prevail
over
a
free
exercise
claim?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
your
argument
certainly
sounds
as
though
that
is
your
position.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
gildin,
on
that
point,
it
is
a
bit
anomalous,
though,
to
suggest
that
if
there
were
many
such
claims
based
on
broadly
held
religious
views,
that
the
analysis
or
the
result
might
somehow
differ,
but
if
there
were
only
a
few
such
beliefs,
then
the
result
you
asked
for
should
be
accorded
more
weight.
that
is
somewhat
anomalous,
don't
you
think?
and
how
do
you
respond
to
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
don't
think
there
is
an
obligation
to
accommodate
widespread
religious
beliefs?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
for
example,
suppose
somebody
has
the
view
that
the
use
of
cocaine
or
heroin
in
a
religious
exercise
is
important
to
them,
and
the
government
in
its
effort
to
prohibit
traffic
in
cocaine
is
aware
of
the
use
of
it
by
this
individual.
now,
can
a
free
exercise
claim
prevail
over
the
government's
right
to
use
the
information
in
criminal
proceedings?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
interest
in
preventing
fraud
in
welfare
programs
is
likewise
compelling,
is
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
don't
dispute
that,
do
you?
