mr.
geller,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
has
little
bird
of
the
snow
or
whatever
her
name
is
in
receiving
afdc
benefits?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
her
parents
applied
for
them,
and--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--have
they
included
her
in
the
application?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
she
has
been
receiving
benefits.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
see.
it
is
really
kind
of
strange,
because
i
guess
they
had
the
number,
as
we
now
know,
and
this
number
is
supposed
to
prevent
precisely
the
kind
of
error
that
occurred
in
this
case
even
though
they
had
the
number.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
see.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
another
hypothetical
question?
assume
little
bird
grows
up
to
be
18
years
of
age
and
decides
she
wants
to
enter
the
military
service,
and
everyone
in
the
military
service
has
to
have
a
number.
would
her
religion
then
compel
her
to
make
the
same
arguments
you
are
making
here
today?
is
it
use
of
any
number,
or
just
a
number
that
results
in
her
receiving
money
free
from
the
government
rather
than
money
that
may
come
as
pay
for
military
service?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
why
not?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
you
are
saying
that
her
position
is
that
the
use
of
any
number
that
may
result
in
benefit
directly
or
indirectly
to
her
is
forbidden
by
her
religion?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
not
a
military
identification
number?
