mr.
geller,
if
you
give
your
license,
driver's
license
a
number,
you
give
his
social
security
number,
don't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
if
the
government
asked
that
anybody
asking
for
this
age
shall
show
their
driver's
license,
you
would
be
in
just
as
much
trouble,
wouldn't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
driver's
license
gives
your
social
security
number.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
my
driver's
license
has
my
social
security
number--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--written
on
the
license.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
what
i
am
talking
about.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
the
difference
between
that
end--
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
you
want
is
the
social
security
number.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
get
it
off
the
driver's
license.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
gildin,
i
tried
once.
it
still
don't
understand
how
the
parents
can
accept
all
of
the
benefits
from
social
security,
including
the
use
of
their
social
security
numbers,
but
the
religion
says
you
don't
allow
that
to
happen
to
your
daughter.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
does
he
continue
to
use
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
daughter's
had
been
used
for
nine
months.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
doesn't
that
put
the
daughter
in
the
same
place
as
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
leave
that
number
there
"dormant",
you
have
no
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
the
government
leaves
that
number
there
"dormant",
you
have
no
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
just
to
leave
it
there
doesn't
affect
you
at
all,
does
it?
