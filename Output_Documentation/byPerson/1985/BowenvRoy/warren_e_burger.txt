chief
justice
warren

we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
bowen,
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services,
against
roy.
mr.
geller,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
many
people
in
the
country
have
social
security
numbers
but
are
not
involved
in
the
social
security
program?
is
that
shown
by
this
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
are
millions
of
people
who--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
gildin.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
belief
of
this
person
on
this
particular
faith
have
any
problem
with
accepting
any
benefits
out
of
a
system
that
is
tainted
by
the
use
of
numbers
for
the
other
people
who
are
in
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wasn't
that
simply
a
result
of
the
fact
that
in
a
system
dealing
with
millions
and
millions
of
people,
they
don't
catch
up
with
all
of
these
details
the
way
it
would
happen
with
the
local
corner
grocery
store
if
there
were
something
like
that
happening?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
they
should
defer
the
benefits?
if
the
papers
come
in
without
a
number,
are
you
suggesting
they
should
defer
the
benefits
until
the
applicant
had
complied
with
all
the
legal
requirements?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
doesn't
that
suggest
that
even
at
best,
with
all
the
modern
computer
technology,
the
handling
of
these
matters
is
quite
difficult?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
go
back
to
the
question
justice
blackmun
put
to
you.
suppose
instead
of
the
government
putting
a
number,
something
is
ordered
by
these
people
for
their
little
daughter
from
sears
roebuck,
and
sears
roebuck
automatically
through
the
computer
puts
a
number
on
every
account.
let's
assume
that.
can
they
get
an
injunction
against
sears
roebuck
to
tell
sears
roebuck
they
must
identify
this
girl
by
a
number?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
isn't
very
private
when
you
get
it
in
the
mail
with
a
number
on
it
any
more
than
the
social
security
benefits
with
a
number
on
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
public
use
that
you
object
to?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
suppose
they
take
this
dormant
social
security
number
and
use
that.
do
you
think
you
can
get
an
injunction
against
sears
roebuck?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
geller?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
