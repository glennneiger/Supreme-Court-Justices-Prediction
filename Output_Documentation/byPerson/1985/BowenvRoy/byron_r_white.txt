well,
if
it
did
undermine
it,
the
court
below
could
not
have
found
that
there
was
a
less
restrictive
alternative.
justice

white
well,
mr.
gildin,
if
you
put
together
the
express
findings
with
the
opinion,
the
discussion,
do
you
really
think
the
district
court
held
that
there
was
an
equally
effective,
less
restrictive
element
in
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
or
no?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
know.
his
only
answer
with
respect
to
the
interstate
aspect
was
that,
well,
the
chances
of
their
making
a
mistake
is
remote.
he
just
didn't
think
there
was
much
of
a
chance.
