justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask,
mr.
geller,
do
you
think
there
is
any
significant
difference
between
the
issue
in
this
case
and
the
issue
we
had
in
that
driver's
license
case
where
the
party
didn't
want
to
have
a
picture--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
you...
maybe
this
is
a
little
bit
too
theoretical,
but
suppose
computer
technology
developed
to
the
extent
that
they
could
use
letters
in
the
name
and
do
all
the
things
you
can
do
with
numbers,
and
so
all
you
had
to
do
was
use
letters
for
little
bird
of
the
snow,
but
the
statute
still
required
numbers.
would
you
think
the
government
would
have
any
basis
for
prevailing
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
you
could
require
a
date
of
baptism,
a
baptismal
certificate?
often
pension
funds
do
this.
justice
john
paul
stevens
say
somebody
had
an
objection
to
revealing
whether
or
not
they
were
baptized.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
mr.
gildin,
on
this
question,
religions
sometimes
have
a
way
of
captivating
the
interest
of
large
numbers
of
people
very
suddenly,
and
supposing
there
were
to
become
a
large
number
of
people
who
subscribed
to
the
same
view
about
the
harmful
effects
of
numbers,
so
you
had
instead
of
one
family,
you
had
maybe
10,000
or
15,000
families
with
the
same
objection.
would
the
case
constitutionally
be
any
different?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
the
improbability,
but
that
really
wasn't
my
question.
assuming
that
it
did
happen,
that
the
religion
suddenly
took
off,
would
the
analysis
really
be
any
different?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
another
question,
mr.
gildin,
about
the
ramifications
of
your
prevailing
in
the
case?
supposing
you
do
win
and
there
is
this
right
at
stake,
and
the
government
gets
another
application
from
a
person
who
has
previously
identified
himself
as
having
this
religion.
is
there
any
special
procedural
requirement
the
government
should
follow?
do
they
have
to
grant
it
right
away
or
do
they
have
to
set
up
a
hearing
for...
how
do
they
process
these
in
the
future?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
somebody
in
the
department
would
have
the
authority
to
pass
on
the
sincerity
of
the
application?
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
least
do
we
have
to
assure
that
there
would
be
a
hearing
of
that
magnitude
on
every
application?
