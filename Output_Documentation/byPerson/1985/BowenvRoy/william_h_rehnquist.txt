justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
could
the
district
court
have
enjoined
the
government
from
failing
to
provide
social
security
based
on
the
failure
to
have
furnished
the
number
if
the
number
had
already
been
applied
for?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
the
district
court's
response
to
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--for
a
population
of
240
million,
that
is
quite
a
number.

[generallaughter.]
there
are
a
lot
of
dead
ones.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--what
justice
marshall
is
talking
about
is,
in
virginia
your
driver's
license
number
is
your
social
security
number.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
his
daughter
wasn't
old
enough
to
drive
anyway.

justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
the
days
when
prince
was
decided,
was
the
court
speaking
then
in
terms
of
less
restrictive
alternatives?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
geller,
what
if
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
justice
stevens
has
it
could
be
shown
that
it
would
cost
the
government
$10
billion
to
convert
from
numbers
to
letters.
then
what
would
be
the
outcome
of
the
claim?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
gildin,
what
do
you
say
to
your
opponent's
comment
about
the
opinion
of
the
court
at
page
19a
that
he
quoted
from
that
last
paragraph
carrying
over
to
page
20
where
the
court
says,
"it
appears
to
the
court
that
the
harm
that
the
government
might
suffer
if
the
plaintiffs
prevailed
in
this
case
would
be
at
worse
that
one
or
perhaps
a
few
individuals
could
fraudulently
obtain
welfare
benefits.
"
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
certainly
that
sentence
suggests
that
the
district
court
says
there
may
be
a
little
problem
but
we
will
just
have
to
live
with
it.
