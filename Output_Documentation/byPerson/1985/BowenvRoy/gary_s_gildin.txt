mr.
gary
s.
gildin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
before
this
court
today
are
the
parents
of
now
five-year-old
little
bird
of
the
snow
roy,
whose
religion,
founded
in
native
american
beliefs,
tells
them
that
in
order
to
preserve
their
daughter's
spiritual
purity,
they
may
not
provide
a
social
security
number
for
her
even
if
it
means
foregoing
necessary
welfare
benefits.
as
this
court
has
plainly
demonstrated
in
its
free
exercise
decisions,
it
does
not
respond
to
these
beliefs
by
either
rejecting
them
because
they
may
seem
to
others
unorthodox
nor
replying,
well,
that
since
congress
requires
generally
a
social
security
number,
it
must
be
provided
here.
rather,
it
is
the
majesty
of
our
constitution
and
its
profound
respect
for
religion
that
this
court
accepts
these
beliefs
when
as
here
they
are
undisputably
religious
and
sincere,
and
ask
the
question,
can
the
government
reasonably
accommodate
these
beliefs
in
order
to
preserve
the
religion
of
these
native
americans.
are
there
alternatives
to
the
social
security
number
which
can
in
fact
satisfy
the
government's
interests
while
at
the
same
time
preserving
the
spirit
of
little
bird
of
the
snow,
and
this
is
done
not
to
afford
the
roy
family
any
favored
treatment
on
account
of
its
religion,
but
rather
to
avoid
unequal
treatment
which
the
free
exercise
clause
precludes
and
congress
did
not
intend.
the
district
court
in
fact
held
that
there
is
no
need
in
this
case
to
either
sacrifice
the
roys'
religion
nor
sacrifice
governmental
interests.
because
the
core
of
the
government's
position
seems
to
be
its
disagreement
with
the
district
court's
express
findings
of
fact,
i
would
like
to
begin
by
examining
those
findings
and
briefly
why
they
are
not
clearly
erroneous,
but
to
the
contrary
are
quite
obviously
correct.
contrary
to
mr.
geller's
representations,
the
district
court
did
not
find
that
accommodating
a
little
fraud,
rather,
allowing
a
little
fraud,
is
the
type
of
accommodation
required.
rather,
it
expressly
found
in
both
findings
of
fact
85
that
in
fact
alternatives
to
the
social
security
number
can
in
fact
satisfy
the
government's
interest
in
preventing
fraud,
alternatives
as
noted
in
findings
82
and
84
which
require
no
modification
to
the
government's
computer
system.
mr.
gary
s.
gildin
that
was
made
after
discrete
findings
by
the
district
court
that
searches
can
be
done
of
all
federal
files
that
are
relevant
without
the
social
security
number,
that
searches
could
be
done
intrastate
of
all
files
without
the
social
security
number,
that
notwithstanding
the
government's
representations,
the
district
court
was
not
persuaded
that
interstate
searches,
searches
of
whether
an
individual
is
receiving
benefits
in
two
states.
mr.
gary
s.
gildin
i
think,
justice
rehnquist,
that
follows
its
findings
that
it
was
not
persuaded
by
the
government's
evidence
that
such
interstate
searches
would
be
impossible.
the
alleged
conflict
there
was
that
perhaps
the
formatting
of
information
in
the
computers
between
two
states
would
not
be
common,
that
one
state
may
use
four
letters
of
the
last
name
and
the
other
would
use
in
fact
the
full
last
name,
and
that
we
may
not
be
able
to
in
fact
do
the
searches
because
of
the
same
format
by
the
computer.
however,
the
district
court
also
found
at
worst,
i
suggest,
it
would
take
a
little
clerical
time
to
conduct
such
searches.
and
indeed,
as
i
stated,
the
searches
can
be
done
without
modification
as
the
district
court
found
can
be
done
without
any
discrete
financial
expenditure,
as
the
district
court
found.
indeed,
these
alternatives
are
currently
in
place
and
being
utilized.
mr.
gary
s.
gildin
no,
it
does
not,
chief
justice
burger.
mr.
roy
does
not
object
to
the
fact
that
numbers
of
other
persons
are
provided.
it
is
his
belief
that
for
him
to
provide
a
number
for
his
daughter,
little
bird
of
the
snow,
would
rob
her
spirit
and
perhaps
deprive
her
of
her
ability
to
become
a
holy
person,
and
that
is
a
decision
that
only
she
can
make.
indeed,
he
is
not
suggesting
that
she
must
follow
that
decision.
what
he
needs
to
do
is
to
preserve
a
state
of
affairs
where
she
will
be
able
to
make
that
choice,
which
is
why
the
fact
this
injunction
extends
only
to
the
time
when
she
is
age
16
gives
him
entirely
the
relief
which
he
seeks.
mr.
gary
s.
gildin
it
may,
but
based
upon
particular
factual
differences
here,
the
district
court
considered,
i
think
properly,
that
that
is
not
likely
to
occur.
first
of
all,
past
history
in
the
eleven
years
that
this
number
has
been
required
it
is
undisputed
that
there
have
been
only
four
religious
objections
to
the
numbers,
and
no
evidence
offered
by
the
government
that
there
were
in
fact
other
exemptions.
mr.
gary
s.
gildin
if
in
fact
the
government
could
show
that
in
fact
what
would
happen
as
in
the
lee
case
is
that
we
would
be
besieged
by
a
number
of
requests
for
exemptions.
yes,
the
analysis
would
differ.
but
this
is
something
that
the
district
court
considered,
because
unlike
the
situation
with
tax
exemptions,
there
is
no
economic
incentive
to
suddenly
convert
one's
belief
to
object
to
a
social
security
number.
you
are
not
afforded
favored
treatment.
the
government
does
not
relax
its
eligibility
requirements
to
allow
one
to
receive
benefits.
it
is
the
same
economic
standards
required.
nor
does
the
scrutiny
become
relaxed
for
failure
to
provide
the
number.
as
the
district
court
found,
we
do
the
very
same
computer
searches
without
the
social
security
number,
and
indeed
i
think
it
may
be
reasonably
inferred
that
given
the
rarity
of
these
exemptions,
we
are
likely
to
see
at
least
equal
if
not
greater
scrutiny,
given
the
unusual
nature
of
such
claims.
and
we
think
that
you
may
not,
as
this
court
suggested
in
sherbert
and
thomas,
simply
deny
an
individuals'
free
exercise
of
religion
based
upon
the
government's
ability
to
simply
hypothesize
a
situation
which
results
in
a
flood
of
exemptions,
because
that
would
result
in
denying
free
exercise
in
virtually
every
case.
what
the
court
is
required
to
do,
and
we
think
sensibly,
is
to
not
only
take
a
look
at
the
past,
but
try
to
project
the
future
based
upon
evidence
and
common
sense
as
to
whether
there
are
likely
to
be
a
rash
of
exemptions,
and
absent
the
economic
incentives
here
which
distinguishes
this
case
significantly
from
the
lead
case,
it
is
not
likely
that
this
is
about
to
occur.
with
respect
to
the
district
court's
findings
of
fact,
it
is
significant
that
its
findings
by
all
purposes
served
by
the
social
security
number
may
be
accomplished
by
alternative
means
of
identification
was
not
arrived
at
by
accepting
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses
we
called
and
rejecting
the
testimony
of
the
government
witnesses.
rather,
those
findings
were
based
upon
evidence
which
issued
from
the
government's
very
own
witnesses,
which
conceded
that
in
fact
these
searches
not
only
can
be
but
have
been
done
without
the
social
security
number.
as
has
been
already
noted,
little
bird
of
the
snow
received
benefits
for
nine
months
prior
to
the
time
that
this
lawsuit
was
commenced
without
providing
a
social
security
number.
and
the
witnesses,
as
the
district
court
noted,
presented
no
evidence
that
any
harm
had
resulted
or
would
result.
mr.
gary
s.
gildin
the
system
as
described
by
the
government's
own
witnesses
would
be
that
in
fact
the
computer
verification
would
have
been
done
within
that
nine-month
period
of
time.
indeed,
the
government
was
well
aware
at
the
state
level
that
no
number
had
been
provided.
mr.
gary
s.
gildin
no,
we
are
not.
all
i
am
suggesting,
chief
justice
burger,
is
that
the
government
never
said
that
in
this
nine-month
period
of
time
they
did
not
and
could
not
do
these
computer
searches.
in
fact,
this
wasn't
the
first
time
the
government
was
required
to
provide
benefits
without
a
social
security
number.
in
1977,
judge
weinstein
from
the
eastern
district
of
new
york
ordered
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
to
provide
benefits
to
the
stephens
children
without
requiring
a
social
security
number
because,
as
here,
there
were
religious
objections
lodged
by
the
parents.
each
and
every
one
of
the
government's
witnesses
was
asked
what
happened
after
the
stephens
case.
was
there
any
need
to
modify
your
computers?
was
there
any
problem
with
conducting
the
searches.
and
as
the
district
court
noted,
no
witness
was
aware
of
any
harm.
it
is
important
that
at
no
time
did
the
government
contend
that
these
searches
could
not
be
done
without
a
social
security
number.
if
one
consults
the
affidavit
of
mr.
herrin
which
was
filed
in
support
of
the
summary
judgment
motion
by
the
government,
paragraph
9
of
that
affidavit
at
page
23
of
the
joint
appendix
explains
what
the
problem
is
if
we
don't
have
a
number.
and
that
is
that
without
a
social
security
number,
were
we
to
search
by
name
only,
we
would
have
duplication
in
the
sense
that
there
may
be
many
files
which
would
share
a
certain
name.
and
what
would
be
required
would
be
to
do
additional
searches,
according
to
mr.
herrin,
using
additional
identifiers
such
as
date
of
birth,
county
of
residence,
parents'
names,
and
the
like,
and
he
did
not
say
that
those
would
be
unworkable.
indeed,
if
we
look
at
the
government's
own
evidence,
which
indicated
that
there
were
55,000
persons
nationwide
with
the
last
name
of
roy,
and
simply
adding
one
identifier,
the
first
name
stephen,
reduces
it
to
32
persons
nationwide
without
regard
to
adding
middle
initial,
date
of
birth,
county
of
residence,
parents'
names,
and
the
like.
the
vice
of
the
absence
of
a
social
security
number,
as
that
affidavit
indicated,
that
searches
might
take
more
time,
these
additional
searches,
not
that
they
would
be
unworkable
or
unreliable,
but
would
take
more
time.
we
learned
at
trial
that
there
is
no
need
for
additional
searches,
because
given
the
sophistication
of
computers,
each
and
every
search
includes
not
only
name
and
social
security
number,
but
includes
date
of
birth,
county
of
residence,
in
some
instances
parents'
names.
and
indeed,
within
the
searching
system,
the
social
security
number
is
not
given
the
greatest
weight
amongst
the
various
factors
searched.
that
is,
the
factors
of
name,
date
of
birth,
and
county
of
residence
cumulatively
have
three
and
a
half
times
the
weight
of
a
social
security
number.
searches
can
be
done
without
this
number
reliably.
it
is
not
the
infallible
identifier,
which
is
why
it
is
given
less
weight.
as
congress
itself
has
recognized,
many
people
have
more
than
one
social
security
number.
a
person
attempting
to
defraud
the
government
could
provide
only
one
of
those
numbers
in
an
application
for
welfare
benefits,
and
if
he
was
receiving
benefits
under
another
number,
searching
under
the
number
provided
alone
would
not
identify
that
particular
attempt
to
defraud
the
government.
mr.
gary
s.
gildin
the
handling
of
these
matters
is
quite
difficult
in
all
circumstances,
and
we
don't
contest
that
fraud
is
in
fact
a
significant
concern
as
a
general
proposition,
but
as
the
district
court
found,
the
government's
interest
in
preventing
fraud
can
in
fact
be
accomplished
without
requiring
the
social
security
number
for
these
religious
objectors.
the
question
was
asked
as
to
whether
this
was
a
situation
where
we
are
just
exempting
one
person,
and
the
trial
judge
went
beyond
that.
we
expressed
the
concern,
as
justice
stevens
has
just
asked
about,
what
about
other
potential
likely
religious
objectors?
we
considered
that
issue,
and
noted,
first
of
all,
that
the
same
alternatives
would
work
for
persons
who
unlike
a
native
american
indian
like
little
bird
of
the
snow
had
a
unique
name,
using
these
other
identifiers
but
also
work
for
persons
whose
names
were
not
unique.
he
also
determined
that
there
are
not
likely
to
be
a
great
number
of
exemptions
sought
based,
as
i
noted,
on
past
history,
which
indicated
that
there
had
only
been
four
to
date.
mr.
gary
s.
gildin
what
the
government
contends
is
anomalous
we
suggest
makes
constitutional
common
sense.
first
of
all,
were
these
widespread
religious
beliefs?
mr.
gary
s.
gildin
we
think
an
accommodation
ought
to
be
made
to
the
extent
possible.
we
ask
for
reasonable
accommodation.
first
of
all,
for
widely
held
religious
beliefs,
there
is
access
to
the
political
or
legislative
process,
and
we
suggest
that
had
this
been
a
roman
catholic
objection
to
the
social
security
number,
it
may
not
have
been
enacted
in
the
first
place.
when
you
get
down
to
the
fact
that
individuals
with
beliefs
where
they
do
not
have
the
ability
to
either
inform,
much
less
influence
the
political
process,
at
some
point
we
agree
that
even
with
beliefs
that
are
not
mainstream,
the
numbers
may
be
large
enough
to
present
problems
for
the
government.
it
is
not
idiosyncratic.
it
is
unfortunate
that
we
cannot
accommodate
all
such
believers,
but
certainly
we
should
not
adopt
a
rule
that
says,
since
ultimately
we
are
going
to
have
to
draw
a
line
here,
that
we
should
therefore
disregard
protection
of
all
religious
beliefs
because
of
our
need
eventually
to
deny
an
exemption
based
upon
the
number
of
believers.
as
this
court
noted
in
zorach,
constitutional
rights
are
a
matter
of
degree,
and
certainly
at
some
point
when
accommodation
ceases
to
be
reasonable,
we
have
to
draw
a
line
and
deny
the
exemption,
even
if
we
regret
doing
so.
but
that
certainly
does
not
follow
logically
that
therefore
we
should
deny
exemptions
where
in
fact
we
are
able
to
accommodate
it.
so,
i
don't
believe
that
the
is
either
idiosyncratic
or
anomalous.
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
either
idiosyncratic
or
anomalous.
so,
the
court
did
in
fact
consider
not
only
the
effect
of
exempting
little
bird
of
the
snow,
but
the
effect
if
other
likely
religious
objectors
were
afforded
exemptions
and
found
that
there
are
not
likely
to
be
a
significant
number
to
present
the
type
of
problems
that
we
had
in
the
lee
case.
the
government
suggests
that
the
district
court
erred
by
looking
only
at
reality,
that
because
in
reality
there
are
not
likely
to
be
an
adverse
effect
on
the
system
by
exempting
little
bird
of
the
snow
and
other
likely
religious
objectors,
the
government
posits
that
through
its
programmatic
interest
analysis,
that
the
district
court
should
have
considered
the
effect
of
exempting
all
persons
from
the
requirement,
not
only
religious
objectors
but
persons
who
have
currently
provided
the
social
security
number
and
who
will
continue
to
do
so
notwithstanding
whether
or
not
religious
exemptions
are
granted.
it
is
in
some
all
or
none
test.
you
either
must
exempt
all
persons
or
you
must
exempt
none.
mr.
gary
s.
gildin
the
parties
seeking
an
exemption
must
certainly
establish
that
his
belief
is
both
religious
and
sincerely
held.
no
new
administrative
mechanism
need
be
set
up.
it
is
currently
in
place,
indeed
was
utilized
in
this
case.
mr.
gary
s.
gildin
precisely,
and
that
was
done
in
this
case
with
no
special
training,
interestingly
enough.
this
case
began
with
a
hearing
before
a
hearing
examiner
employed
by
the
pennsylvania
department
of
public
welfare,
who
again
received
no
special
training
for
this
process.
we
brought
mr.
roy
to
the
hearing.
we
also
presented
the
testimony
of
an
expert
in
native
american
religions,
professor
drinnan.
we
submitted
briefs
about
the
objective
legal
standards
that
this
court
has
set
forth
to
determine
whether
a
belief
is
religious
and
sincerely
held.
the
government
submitted
its
belief,
its
briefs,
and
the
hearing
examiner
concluded
based
upon
her
observation
as
testimony
as
well
as
based
upon
the
legal
standards
that
in
fact
this
belief
was
both
religious
and
sincere.
should
we
prevail
here,
no
new
administrative
mechanism
need
be
set
up.
no
special--
mr.
gary
s.
gildin
--certainly
the
applicant
must
establish
that
his
belief
is
both
religious
and
sincere.
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
demanded
that,
and
we
think
properly
so.
mr.
gary
s.
gildin
that
is
correct.
mr.
gary
s.
gildin
i
think
in
order
to
answer
that
question,
justice
blackmun,
we
have
to
identify
how
the
government
came
into
the
possession
of
this
number,
and
this
was
no
surprise
revelation
to
mr.
roy
or
anyone
else
at
the
conclusion
of
this
trial.
the
number
was
obtained
for
her
without
anyone's
knowledge
in
terms
of
her
family.
at
the
time
that
karen
miller,
her
mother,
was
being
wheeled
out
of
the
labor
room
literally
as
a
welfare
recipient
she
was
presented
with
a
sheaf
of
papers
which
she
signed,
and
with
no
knowledge
that
one
of
those
was
an
application
for
the
social
security
number.
mr.
gary
s.
gildin
application.
mr.
gary
s.
gildin
no,
it
did
not.
in
fact,
then
suddenly
a
number
came
in
the
mail
to
them,
and
when
mr.
roy
received
it,
he
asked
his
wife,
you
know,
where
did
this
come
from,
did
you
file
an
application?
she
said,
no,
i
have
no
awareness
of
it.
they
sent
it
back.
they
received
assurance
from
the
social
security
administration
that
it
would
remain
dormant
so
long
as
they
had
not
used
it.
mr.
gary
s.
gildin
the
government's
proposed
use
of
the
number
places
the
very
burden
on
the
roys'
religion
that
this
court
has
found...
has
condemned
in
both
sherbert--
mr.
gary
s.
gildin
--no,
they
are
concerned
now
as
to
the
use
of
the
child's,
and
certainly
at
age
2
little
bird
of
the
snow
is
not
in
a
position
to
say,
i
have
articulated
my
religious
beliefs
and
consequently
i
don't
think
you
should
use
it,
nor
can
she
do
so
at
age
5.
mr.
roy's
religion,
consistent
with
that
of
native
americans,
is
that
ultimately
the
children
are
going
to
have
to
make
this
decision
for
themselves,
and
what
he
has
to
do
is
to
preserve
the
state
of
affairs
that
is
going
to
enable
little
bird
of
the
snow
to
come
to
her
own
understanding.
should
he
permit
the
government
to
use
this
number
now,
she
is
deprived
forever
of
that
choice.
should
she
ultimately
conclude
that,
yes,
the
social
security
number
can
rob
one's
spirit
should
he
permit
this
number
to
be
used,
again,
that
choice
is
denied
to
her.
what
he
has
sought
and
what
he
has
obtained
from
the
district
court
is
preservation
of
a
state
of
affairs
which
allows
little
bird
of
the
snow
to
make
that
decision
for
herself.
mr.
gary
s.
gildin
certainly
to
that...
to
the
extent
that
that
information
when
used
would
affect
the
individual's
religion,
and
in
this
case
have
the
potency
to--
mr.
gary
s.
gildin
--no,
we
do
not
claim
the
right
to
free
exercise
of
religion
to
be
absolute.
the
inquiry
that
this
court
has
used
which
we
accept
is
that
once
the
belief
is
established
as
religious
and
sincere,
the
government
may
in
fact
put
its
interests
above
those
beliefs
if
those
interests
are
both
compelling
and
there
is
no
less
restrictive
alternative.
and
in
a
situation
as
you
posit,
justice
o'connor,
where
the
government
had
in
the
interest
of
public
welfare
or
public
safety
made
the
determination
that
use
of
these
drugs
was
in
fact
something
not
to
be
sanctioned,
the
exception
in
that
case
would
undermine
the
government's
very
judgment,
and
if
that
interest
was
found
to
be
compelling,
religion
would
have
to
give
way.
mr.
gary
s.
gildin
if
it
is--
mr.
gary
s.
gildin
--not
if
in
fact
it
was
demonstrated
that
there
was
the
risk
of
fraud
presented
that
would
in
fact
undermine
or
make
the
statutory
scheme
unworkable.
this
court
has,
however,
in
some
of
its
opinions,
in
sherbert
and
thomas,
indicated
that
simply
asserting
that
there
is
fraud
at
stake
does
not
in
and
of
itself
make
it
compelling.
we
have
to
find
out,
are
those
interests
in
fact
endangered.
more
significantly,
however,
where
in
fact
the
exemption,
as
here,
does
not
in
fact
undermine
the
government's
interest
in
fraud,
accommodation
is
required.
mr.
gary
s.
gildin
that
is
certainly
correct,
and
we
disagree
with
the
government's
attempt
to
challenge
those
findings,
first,
today,
by
saying
that
those
findings
are
not
there,
and
in
its
brief,
we
submit,
by
saying
those
findings
are
clearly
erroneous
when
quit
obviously--
mr.
gary
s.
gildin
--the
religion
says,
justice
marshall,
that
they
would
not
allow
it
to
happen
to
themselves.
unfortunately
for
mr.
roy,
his
spirit
has
been
robbed
by
virtue
of
the
use
before
he
came
to
an
understanding
of
these
religious
beliefs.
mr.
gary
s.
gildin
he
does,
because
under
his
religion
once
extensive
use
has
been
made,
that
part
of
your
spirit
has
been
robbed,
and
there
is
no
way
to
retrieve
it.
mr.
gary
s.
gildin
the
daughter's--
mr.
gary
s.
gildin
--the
evidence
is
that
the
daughter's
number
has
never
been
used,
that
the
government
in
that
nine-month
period
of
time
did
not
use
her
number.
it
was
in
their
files,
and
lie
dormant.
he
did
not
provide
that
number.
it
was
not
utilized.
there
was
never
a
witness
who
took
the
stand
and
said,
the
way
we
did
it
for
those
nine
months
was
to
use
the
number.
the
evidence--
mr.
gary
s.
gildin
--i
am
sorry.
mr.
gary
s.
gildin
if
they
are
willing
to
provide
the
benefits
while
leaving
that
number
dormant,
we
would
not
be
here
today
because
there
would
be
no
burden--
mr.
gary
s.
gildin
--if
that
number
would
remain
dormant,
that
would
not
undermine
his
religious
beliefs.
indeed,
his
objection
is
not
to
the
existence,
but
to
the
extensive
use
of
that
number,
and
that
is
what
that
injunction
protects
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
gary
s.
gildin
under
the
free
exercise
clause
of
the
constitution,
they
cannot.
that
would
be
a
private
use
of
that
number,
and
there
is
no
constitutional
right
against
the
private
use
of
that
particular
number.
mr.
gary
s.
gildin
i
agree--
mr.
gary
s.
gildin
--it
is
the
extensive
use
by
the
government.
indeed,
if
there
is
no
social
security
number
that
is
distributed
to
the
private
sector
as
there
will
not
be
under
this
court's
injunction,
sears
roebuck
will
not
be
identifying
little
bird
of
the
snow
with
a
social
security
number.
should
sears
roebuck
decide
to
use
some
number
to
identify
her
that
is
not
going
to
be
common
to
other
governmental
uses,
mr.
roy
has
no
religious
objection
to
that.
mr.
gary
s.
gildin
the
injunction
we
have
obtained
would
preclude
sears
roebuck
from
getting
that
social
security
number.
the
district
court
enjoined
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
from
disseminating
that
number
to
any
public
of
private
entity,
so
sears
roebuck
cannot
contact
the
social
security
administration
and
say,
can
you
tell
us
what
a
social
security
number
for
little
bird
of
the
snow
is?
that
is
not
available.
mr.
gary
s.
gildin
what
we
lose
by
not--
mr.
gary
s.
gildin
--no.
only
with
respect
to
efficiency.
yes
in
terms
of
reliability.
without
the
social
security--
mr.
gary
s.
gildin
--i
disagree
respectfully,
justice
white.
what
i
believe
would
happen
is
that
they
would
have
to
manually
attempt
to
do
the
verification.
because
the
computer
wouldn't
be
able
to
match
them
up
because
of
different
formatting,
we
would
have
to
spend
clerical
time
to
find
out
last
names
and
these
other
identifiers,
and
that
is
the
difference
with
the
social
security
number.
in
such
instances,
it
simply
takes
more
time,
an
interest
which
this
court
has
held
and
we
suggest
is
not
the
type
of
compelling
interest.
it
is
the
computer
that
enhances
the
reliability.
having
the
number
gives
an
incremental
increase
in
efficiency.
mr.
gary
s.
gildin
if
she
would
have
the
objection,
and
i
can't
speak
to
that,
this
case
would
not
preclude
the
government
automatically
from
requiring
the
number.
we
would
have
to
engage--
mr.
gary
s.
gildin
--because
we
would
have
to
engage
in
the
analysis
in
this
different
program
that
was
used
here.
is
the
government's
interest
there
compelling,
and
are
there
less
restrictive
alternatives
under
the
facts
of
that
circumstance.
mr.
gary
s.
gildin
no,
i
believe
the
objection
is
the
use
of
the
social
security
number
as
the
unique
identifier--
mr.
gary
s.
gildin
--i
can't
speak
to
that,
because
the
objection...
they
have
not
been
presented
with
that
situation.
the
objection
is
to
a
social
security
number
presently
because
it
is
unique
to
her
and
extensively
used.
it
is
not
an
objection
to
all
numbers.
it
is
not
objection
to
all
identification,
and
should
that
military
situation
arise
where
the
government's
interests
may
be
different,
and
in
fact
the
alternatives
perhaps
unavailable,
then
certainly
the
government
is
entitled
to
put
on
that
case.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
