mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
involves
a
challenge
to
the
constitutionality
of
two
federal
statutes
that
require
applicants
for
welfare
benefits
to
provide
the
government
with
their
social
security
numbers
as
a
condition
on
receiving
those
benefits.
appellees
claim
that
it
would
violate
their
rights
under
the
free
exercise
clause
of
the
first
amendment
if
they
had
to
provide
the
social
security
number
of
their
daughter,
little
bird
of
the
snow.
the
district
court
agreed
with
this
claim
and
declare
the
statute
unconstitutional
and
ordered
the
government
to
provide
the
welfare
benefits
without
insisting
that
the
appellees
comply
with
the
social
security
number
requirement.
we
have
taken
a
direct
appeal
to
this
court.
before
turning
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
i
would
like
to
mention
very
briefly
an
important
aspect
of
the
two
federal
programs
that
are
involved
here.
both
the
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children
program
and
the
food
stamp
program
are
obviously
based
on
financial
need,
and
the
amount
of
the
government
grant
is
a
function
of
family
size
and
family
income.
as
a
result,
all
earned
and
unearned
income
of
each
family
member
has
to
be
counted
in
determining
eligibility
and
the
amount
of
benefits.
therefore,
under
both
programs,
it
is
essential
that
benefit
applicants
furnish
income
and
eligibility
data
for
each
member
of
the
family,
including
children,
and
that
we
be
able
to
verify
that
information
for
each
member
of
the
family.
now,
when
appellee
stephen
roy
applied
for
afdc
and
food
stamp
benefits,
he
agreed
to
give
the
government
his
own
social
security
number
and
the
social
security
numbers
of
his
wife
and
elder
daughter,
but
he
refused
to
give
the
social
security
number
of
his
younger
daughter,
little
bird
of
the
snow.
roy
claimed
that
as
a
result
of
his
religious
beliefs,
he
considers
social
security
numbers
to
be
part
of
the
so-called
great
evil,
because
the
numbers
are
used
by
computers,
and
therefore
rob
people's
spirits.
now,
roy
testified
that
the
evil
of
social
security
numbers
is
related
to
their
function
as
unique
personal
identifiers,
and
that
if
he
had
to
obtain
a
social
security
number
for
little
bird
of
the
snow
and
provide
it
to
the
government,
it
would
rob
her
spirit
and
deprive
her
of
the
ability
to
achieve
greater
power.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
my
comment
was
simply
to
explain
roy's
testimony.
we
have
not
challenged
in
this
court.
we
did
challenge
in
the
district
court.
we
have
not
challenged
in
this
court
that
it
is
the
product
of
a
sincere
religious
belief,
but
i
am
sure
it
is
sincere.
we
have
some
doubts
whether
it
is
the
product
of
a
religious
belief.
i
think
many
people
in
our
society
have
these
sorts
of
concerns.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
we
have
not.
it
is
a
futile
exercise,
we
think,
to
challenge
those
sorts
of
findings.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
yes.
i
was
about
to
come
to
that,
justice
brennan.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
am
sure
as
this
court
is
aware
from
reading
the
briefs,
there
are
a
number
of
peculiar
aspects
to
this
case.
the
most
peculiar,
i
think,
is
that
the
case
had
been
tried
on
the
assumption
that
little
bird
of
the
snow
did
not
have
a
social
security
number,
and
that
it
would
violate
roy's
first
amendment
rights
if
he
had
to
obtain
one
for
her
and
provide
it
to
the
government,
but
it
came
out
on
the
last
day
of
trial
that
she
in
fact
did
have
a
social
security
number
because
her
mother
had
applied
for
one
right
after
she
was
born.
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
when
this
revelation
was
made
roy
changed
somewhat
the
nature
of
his
constitutional
objections.
this
case
had
been
brought
on
the
theory
and
the
complaint
charged
that
roy's
first
amendment
rights
would
be
violated
by
having
to
obtain
and
provide
a
social
security
number
to
the
government
in
order
to
get
welfare
benefits.
but
after
the
surprise
revelation
that
despite
what
roy
had
led
the
district
court
and
the
government
to
believe,
little
bird
in
fact
had
a
social
security
number.
roy
claimed
at
that
point
that
he
was
instead
concerned
more
with
the
use
and
dissemination
of
the
number
rather
than
having
to
provide
it
to
the
government.
in
any
event,
the
district
court
held
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial
that
the
social
security
number
requirement
was
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
roy,
and
the
court
enjoined
the
government
from
denying
welfare
benefits
based
on
roy's
failure
to
provide
that
number
to
the
government.
now,
in
reaching
its
constitutional
holding,
the
district
court
found
as--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--the
district
court
enjoyed
the
government
from
using
or
disseminating
the
number
that
we
already
had.
of
course,
we
have
made
a
separate
objection
to
the
injunction
on
the
ground
that
our
use
of
the
number,
which
doesn't
require
any
action
or
belief
on
the
part
of
the
appellee,
wouldn't
violate
the
first
amendment.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the
district
court's
response
was
not
much
of
a
response.
it
held
that
this
was
the
only
way
to
protect
the
perceived
first
amendment
rights
of
roy.
now,
as
i
said,
the
district
court
did
find
that
roy
had
a
sincere
religious
objection,
and
we
are
not
objecting
to
that
here,
but
by
the
same
token,
the
district
court
also
found
that
the
government
had
a
compelling
interest
in
using
social
security
numbers
in
order
to
effectively
manage
programs
of
this
size
to
verify
eligibility
and
the
amount
of
benefits
and
to
ferret
out
and
deter
fraud.
and
despite
roy's
attempts
to
argue
otherwise
in
this
court,
i
don't
think
there
can
be
any
serious
objection
to
that
finding
by
the
district
court.
there
really
can't
be
any
doubt
that
the
government
has
a
compelling
interest
in
seeing
that
$20
billion
a
year
in
welfare
benefits
are
targeted
to
the
people
that
congress
meant
to
receive
them,
and
it
is
undisputed
that
the
use
of
social
security
numbers
is
instrumental
in
accomplishing
that
important
objective.
now,
the
district
court
failed
to
have
found
that
there
was
a
compelling
government
interest
in
using
social
security
numbers,
and
the
question
under
the
free
exercise
clause
therefore
became
whether
the
government
had
any
less
restrictive
means
available
to
it
to
accomplish
that
objective
in
a
way
that
wouldn't
interfere
with
roy's
religious
beliefs.
we
believe
that
the
district
court
was
plainly
wrong
in
the
way
it
went
about
answering
that
question.
i
think
the
district
court
first
of
all
failed
to
appreciate
that
under
this
court's
free
exercise
cases
any
less
restrictive
alternative
imposed
on
the
government
must
be...
must
actually
be
capable
of
achieving
the
governmental...
the
compelling
governmental
interest,
at
least
to
the
same
extent
that
the
challenged
provision
would
achieve
that
interest.
and
we
also
think
that
the--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes,
we
think
that
is
the
wrong
question.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the
wrong
test.
i
hope
to
elaborate
on
this,
but
the
court
has
never
asked
that
question.
when
the
court
has
found
that
there
was
a
compelling
government
interest
and
there
was
no
less
restrictive
alternative
available
to
the
government,
the
court
has
never
gone
on
to
ask
whether
it
makes
any
difference
if
we
just
exempt
one
person.
and
a
number
of
this
court's
cases
in
fact--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i
think,
justice
o'connor,
that
case
like
sherbert
are
explainable
by
the
fact
that
the
court
there
found
and
i
think
quite
correctly
that
there
was
a
less
restrictive
alternative
available
to
the
government
in
those
cases.
in
sherbert,
the
purported
government
interest
was
to
prevent
fraudulent
claims
on
the
unemployment
insurance
fund.
the
way
the
state
went
about
avoiding
fraudulent
claims
was
to
simply
wipe
out
any
religious
claim
to
an
exemption.
and
what
the
court
said
was,
there
is
a
less
restrictive
alternative.
you
can
engage
in
an
individualized
inquiry
to
see
whether
a
religious
claim
is
in
fact
fraudulent.
you
don't
have
to
wipe
out
all
religious
claims.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
i
believe
not,
justice
o'connor.
the
court
here
clearly
found,
and
i
hope
to
read
some
of
the
court's
findings
in
a
few
moments,
that
there
was
no
less
restrictive
alternative
that
was
equally
effective
as
the
social
security
requirement.
the
court
in
sherbert
made
the
opposite
finding.
the
court
in
sherbert
didn't
find
that
there
was
no
less
restrictive
alternative,
but
it
didn't
much
matter
whether
mrs.
sherbert
got
her
benefits.
that
is
precisely
what
the
district
court
found
here.
we
think
there
is
absolutely
no
precedent
in
this
court's
free
exercise
cases
for
that
sort
of
a
finding.
now,
i
don't
think
the
court
should
need
any
convincing
about
the
massive
nature
of
the
government
programs
that
we
are
dealing
with
here.
there
are
about
eleven
million
people
who
receive
afdc
benefits
each
month,
and
there
are
about
20
million
people
who
receive
food
stamps.
and
eligibility
for
both
programs
has
to
be
redetermined
periodically.
with
afdc,
i
think
it
is
every
six
months,
and
with
the
food
stamp
program,
it
is
once
every
month
or
so.
and
that
means
that
for
20
or
30
million
recipients,
there
have
to
be
periodic
determinations
about
their
eligibility
for
these
benefits,
and
as
i
said
earlier,
the
way
those
programs
are
run,
the
income
of
each
family
member,
including
children,
has
to
be
taken
into
account
in
determining
whether
a
family
is
eligible
for
benefits
and
the
amount
of
benefits.
it
seems
self-evident
that
the
only
way
you
can
run
a
program
like
this,
the
only
way
you
can
keep
track
of
eligibility
and
verify
what
you
are
told
and
deter
fraud
is
through
the
use
of
computers.
and
computers
talk
to
each
other
through
unique...
through
standardized
data
formats
that
use
unique
personal
identifiers.
and
it
was
congress's
well-considered
judgment
based
on
numerous
reports
that
it
received
from
inspectors
general,
the
grace
commission,
and
others
that
only
the
use
of
social
security
numbers
would
allow
effective
verification
of
an
applicant's
resources
and
income
quickly
and
reliably.
now,
verification
often
requires
that
the
records
of
a
number
of
data
bases
be
checked,
social
security
records,
and
motor
vehicle
bureaus,
unemployment
bureaus,
banks,
schools,
businesses.
these
records
are
indexed
and
accessed
across
the
country
in
a
number
of
different
ways,
but
there
is
only
one
common
element
in
all
these
systems,
and
that
is
the
social
security
number,
and
therefore
you
have
to
have
the
social
security
number
if
you
are
able
to
check
a
lot
of
the
things
that
you
are
being
told
by
applicants
about
what
their
income
and
resources
are.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
this
record
doesn't
reflect
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
there
are
three...
i
think
the
record
shows
that
there
are
about
383
million
active
social
security
numbers.
and
these
programs,
as
i
said
earlier,
have
about
20
or
30
million
people
involved
in
them.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
there
are
some
dead
people,
yes,
who...
once
you
get
a
social
security
number,
justice
rehnquist,
that
account
never
becomes
dormant,
and
that
number
is
never
given
to
anybody
else,
even
if
the
recipient
is
deceased.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
in
most
jurisdictions
you
have
to.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
the
problem
if
we
only
have
the
driver's
license
is
that
we
couldn't
access
a
number
of
these
other
record
systems
that
don't
use
the
driver's
license.
the
only
element--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
we
don't
get
the
actual
driver's
license.
all
we
would
ask
on
the
form
is
for
their
driver's
license
number,
and
the
only
record
system
that
would
likely
have
that
number
is
the
motor
vehicle
bureau,
so
it
wouldn't
help
in
determining,
for
example,
whether
they
applied
for
a
bank
account.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i
understand
that,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
what
i
am
saying
is--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--just
having
their
driver's
license
number
and
not
their
social
security
number
would
not
allow
access
to
any
other
data
system
other
than
the
motor
vehicle
bureau.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i
think
it
is
the
same
way
in
the
district
of
columbia.
i
am
not
sure
it
is
the
same
way
all
across
the
country,
but
i
assume
that
the
appellees,
if
that
were
the
case,
would
object
to
giving
that
number
just
as
well.
they
object
to
the
social
security
number.
they
object
to
any
unique
personal
identifier.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
the
problem,
justice
marshall,
is
that
i
think
mr.
roy
would
have
a
first
amendment
objection
to
giving
the
driver's
license
number
if
it
was
a
unique
personal
identifier.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is
why
we
couldn't
use
a
driver's
license
number
in
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
when
you
first
apply--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--the
parents
applied
for
it
and--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes,
they
have.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
she
received
it
for
a
few
months
until
it
was
determined
that
they
had
not
gotten...
as
soon
as
you
apply
you
get
the
benefits,
and
then
there
is
a
verification.
it
was
determined
that
they
hadn't
gotten
the
social
security
number
for
little
bird
of
the
snow.
the
benefits
were
therefore
reduced
to
reflect
that
fact,
and
that
is
when
this
suit
was
brought.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
the
application
said
that
she
didn't
have
the
number,
and
we
took
their
word
for
that--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--until
it
was
determined
at
the
trial,
in
fact,
when
some
question
was
raised.
we
went
back
and
checked,
and
it
was
quickly
determined
that
she
did
have
a
number,
but
we
are
now
enjoined
from
using
that
number.
now,
in
addition
to
the
points
i
also
made,
it
seems
clear
that
we
need
the
social
security
number
to
ferret
out
fraud.
for
example,
if
two
families
were
to
apply
for
afdc
benefits
trying
to
claim
the
same
child,
unless
we
have
that
child's
social
security
number,
we
would
never
be
able
to
determine
that.
so,
we
think
it
is
clear
that
in
terms
of
achieving
the
propelling
government
interests
that
are
involved
here,
program
integrity,
eligibility
verification,
and
ferreting
out
fraud,
there
is
no
alternative
to
the
social
security
requirement
that
works
anywhere
near
as
well
as
the
one
mandated
by
congress.
and
i
must
say
that
even
the
district
court
was
forced
to
acknowledge
that
fact.
i
think
it
is
useful
in
this
regard
to
look
at
the
district
court's
precise
fact
findings
which
appear
at
pages
7a
and
8a
of
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement.
there,
for
example,
finding
number
60,
the
district
court
clearly
finds
that
the
efficient
operation
of
these
welfare
programs
requires
the
use
of
computer
systems
that
utilize
unique
numerical
identifiers
such
as
the
social
security
number,
and
finding
62,
such
systems
ensure
greater
accuracy
in
providing
benefits
and
in
reducing
fraud,
and
aid
in
the
coordination
of
information
in
various
welfare
systems
to
ensure
the
recipients
are
not
receiving
duplicate
benefits.
and
on
page
3a,
and
on
page
8a,
the
court
finds
in
finding
64
that
using
names
instead
frequently
is
not
sufficient
to
ensure
the
proper
payment
of
benefits,
and
again,
finding
74,
and
again,
find
74,
the
court
finds
that
without
social
security
numbers
you
would
not
be
able
to
do
effective
cross-match.
so,
the
court
has
found
here
that
there
is
a
compelling
government
interest
in
using
social
security
numbers.
the
court
has
also
found
in
the
findings
that
i
just
read
to
the
court
that
there
is
no
less
restrictive
alternative
such
as
the
use
of
names
that
is
equally
as
effective
as
social
security
numbers
in
achieving
the
government's
compelling
interest.
now,
that
should
have
been
the
end
of
the
inquiry
under
this
court's
free
exercise
cases,
but
instead
the
court
nonetheless
concluded
that
the
government
should
be
required
to
accept
admittedly
less
effective
alternatives
simply
because,
as
the
court
candidly
announced,
the
benefits
that
little
bird
sought
were
only
an
insignificant
fraction
of
the
federal
government's
expenditures
for
the
entire
afdc
and
food
stamp
program,
so
what
does
it
matter?
we
think
this
court...
this
analysis
is
completely
misguided
under
this
court's
free
exercise
decisions.
for
example,
in
braunfeld
against
brown,
the
court
rejected
a
free
exercise
challenge
to
the
sunday
closing
laws.
the
court
found
that
the
state
had
a
compelling
interest
there,
that
there
was
no
less
restrictive
alternative
available
to
accomplish
that
interest.
the
court
didn't
go
on
and
then
ask
what
would
be
the
harm
to
allow
a
few
merchants
to
stay
open
on
saturday...
on
sunday?
that
was
just
not
part
of
the
free
exercise
analysis.
by
the
same
token,
in
prince
versus
massachusetts,
the
court
rejected
a
free
exercise
challenge
to
a
state's
child
labor
laws.
the
court
once
again
found
that
there
was
a
compelling
state
interest
in
protecting
the
welfare
of
the
state's
children,
and
that
there
was
no
less
restrictive
alternative
available
to
the
state,
and
that
was
the
end
of
the
court's
analysis.
the
court
did
not
go
on,
as
the
district
court
did
in
this
case,
by
asking
what
would
be
the
harm
to
allow
one
12-year-old
to
distribute
a
religious
tract
under
the
supervision
of
her
parent?
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
believe
that
was
the
analysis
that
the
court
applied,
justice
rehnquist.
it
was
enough
in
those
cases,
and
again
in
united
states
against
lee
the
court
found
that
there
was
a
compelling
government
interest
in
having
every
employer
contribute
to
the
social
security
fund,
and
that
there
was
no
less
restrictive
alternative.
the
court
again
did
not
go
on
and
do
what
the
district
court
did
in
this
case,
which
is
to
ask,
what
would
be
the
harm
nonetheless
in
just
exempting
a
few
amish
from
the
social
security
system?
in
fact,
if
the
court
had
asked
that
question,
if
the
court
had
asked
that
question,
as
i
think
justice
stevens
pointed
out
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
lee,
the
court
probably
would
have
concluded
that
the
system
wouldn't
have
been
hurt
at
all,
because
the
amish
are
also
opposed
to
receiving
social
security
benefits,
and
the
receipt
of
benefits
frequently
costs
more
than
you
take
in
in
taxes.
but
the
court...
that
was
not
the
question
that
the
court
asked.
by
the
same
token
here
we
think
that
the
district
court
should
have
stopped
after
determining
as
it
did
that
the
government
had
a
compelling
government
interest
in
using
the
social
security
numbers,
and
that
there
was
no
less
restrictive
alternative.
it
doesn't
matter,
we
think,
that
only
a
few
people
might
seek
an
exemption
from
the
social
security
requirement.
it
also
doesn't
matter
that
the
government's
compelling
interest
wouldn't
be
totally
frustrated.
the
afdc
program
wouldn't
collapse
if
we
had
to
pay
little
bird
in
the
snow
the
benefits
without
being
able
to
verify
whether
she
was
entitled
to
them.
that
wasn't
part
of
the
test
that
this
court
has
consistently
used
in
the
free
exercise
area,
but
we
can't
subscribe
to
the
principal
notion
that
seems
to
underlie
the
district
court's
opinion,
which
is
that
a
little
bit
of
ineffectiveness
or
a
little
bit
of
fraud
really
doesn't
matter
when
you
are
dealing
with
a
program
of
this
size.
i
might
add
that
that
is
precisely
what
the
appellees
argued
in
the
district
court,
and
i
think
it
is
once
again
instructive
to
look
at
the
record.
at
page
299
of
the
joint
appendix,
this
is
mr.
gildin
giving
his
legal
argument
in
this
case
in
the
district
court,
and
he
says
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
"the
legal
standard,
your
honor,
with
respect
to
the
case
before
the
court,
is
what
effect
is
it
going
to
have
with
respect
to
exempting
little
bird
of
the
snow
from
the
social
security
requirement.
"
"we
believe
we
have
amply
established
that
they
can
do
this
verification
inquiry,
but
even
if
we
cannot.
"
the
appellees
argue,
"even
if
they
cannot,
and
even
if
every
dollar
that
goes
to
her
is
not
proper,
you
will
find
that
the
error
is
miniscule
with
respect
to
what
this
system
accepts
as
an
error
rate.
"
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
that
that
conclusion,
first
of
all,
doesn't
follow
from
the
fact
findings
that
the
district
court
just
made
about
how
there
are
no
less
restrictive
alternatives.
i
think--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i
think,
justice
o'connor,
that
it
is
not
one
of
its
findings.
i
think
that
all
that
the
district--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--the
district
court
found
that
we
could...
that
there
is
not
going
to
be
any
withdrawal
here.
that
is
a
different
sort
of
finding
than
there
is
a
lesser...
in
fact,
justice--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--justice
o'connor,
if
i
could
refer
the
court
on
page
19a
of
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement,
i
think
this
is
the
district
court's
conclusion.
this
is
about
two-thirds
of
the
way
down
the
page.
the
district
court
concludes
by
saying,
"it
appears
to
the
court
that
the
harm
that
the
government
might
suffer
if
the
plaintiffs
prevailed
in
this
case
would
be
at
worst
that
one
and
perhaps
a
few
individuals
could
obtain
welfare
benefits
fraudulently.
"
that
is,
i
think,
how
the
district
court
concluded
that
even
though
there
was
no
less
restrictive
alternative,
it
really
didn't
matter
in
this
case,
because
you
are
dealing
with
one
person.
if
she
doesn't
get
the
right
amount
of
benefits,
the
whole
system
isn't
going
to
collapse.
but
that
is
not
the
right
analysis,
we
think,
under
this
court's
free
exercise
cases.
the
court
has
never
adopted
that
analysis.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
the
analysis
is
precisely
the
same.
i
think
that
we
have
a
much
stronger
case
here
because
there
is
a
much
stronger
compelling
government
interest
in
using
the
social
security
numbers.
i
think
that
is
shown
by
the
fact,
for
example,
that
a
number
of
states
didn't
require
pictures
on
their
driver's
licenses.
i
think
that
is
some
suggestion
that
you
can
accomplish
whatever
the
government
interest
is
without
requiring
every
single
person
to
give
a
photograph.
there
are
no
exemptions.
congress
did
not
allow
any
exemptions
from
the
social
security
requirement.
so
i
think
this
is...
although
the
analysis
is
the
same...
we
filed
a
brief
in
that
case
last
year...
this
is
a
much
more
compelling
case
for
allowing
the
government
to
impose
a
neutral
requirement
even
if
someone
may
have
a
religious
objection.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
it
could
be
shown
that
there
was
a
less
restrictive
alternative
such
as
the
use
of
letters
that
was
equally
as
good
in
achieving
the
government's
interest.
then,
of
course,
under
this
court's
free
exercise
cases
the
religious
claim
would
have
to
prevail.
that
is
most
unlikely,
because
only
numbers
can
be
unique
identifiers.
there
are
only
a
limited
number
of
letters--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--then,
of
course,
we
would
take
the
position
that
only
a
reasonable
less
restrictive
alternative
can
be
imposed
on
the
government.
but
here,
you
don't
have
to
wrestle
with
that
question,
because
the
district
court
found,
and
congress
has
found,
and
i
think
it
is
self-evident
that
there
is
nothing
that
is
as
useful
as
social
security
numbers
for
accomplishing
the
compelling
government
interest
that
i
identified
earlier.
in
fact,
if
there
is
one
point
i
want
to
emphasize
today,
it
is
this.
there
seems
to
us
something
very,
very
wrong
about
the
notion,
something
fundamentally
wrong
about
the
notion
that
someone
can
apply
for
welfare
benefits,
claim
an
entitlement
to
welfare
benefits,
and
yet
refuse
to
give
the
government
the
very
information
that
they
need
to
determine
whether
that
person
is
in
fact
eligible
for
those
benefits.
now,
if
roy
and
his
family
wish
to
avail
themselves
of
afdc
benefits
and
food
stamp
benefits,
that
is
fine,
but
we
can't
believe
that
the
free
exercise
clause
stands
as
an
obstacle
to
congress's
decision
to
ensure
as
efficiently,
as
effectively,
as
reliably
as
possible
that
they
are
entitled
to
those
benefits.
we
can't
believe
that
any--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--absolutely
not.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
efficiency,
as
i
said,
justice
o'connor.
i
also
said
effectively
and
reliably.
that
is
what
is
important.
efficiency
i
would
think
would
only
come
into
play
if
in
justice
rehnquist's
hypothetical
it
might
cost
$20
million
to
accomplish
something
that
we
could
accomplish
for
50
cents
by
using
the
social
security
number.
here,
we
can't
do
it
as
effectively
and
reliably
without
the
use
of
the
social
security
numbers.
i
can't
believe
that
anything
in
this
court's
free
exercise
cases
could
possibly
require
the
government
to
grant
welfare
benefits
on
the
basis
of
incomplete
information
or
whatever
information
applicant
decides
to
provide
to
us.
there
has
to
be
some
independent
way
of
verifying,
and
if
a
person
applies
for
benefits,
it
seems
to
us
only
logical
that
they
should
be
able
to...
they
should
be
required
to
give
us
whatever
neutral
information
we
need
in
order
to
verify
that
they
are
in
fact
eligible
for
those
benefits.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
i
am
sure
we
can
and
do
require--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
once
again,
justice
stevens,
it
may
well
be
that
if
we
had
the
social
security
number,
we
could
find
out
everything
we
needed
even
without
the
date
of
birth
or
the
date
of
baptism.
but
the
social
security
number
is
central.
it
is
the
only
requirement
that
congress
has
imposed
on
this
entire
system,
and
it
is
the
only
requirement
that
allows
access
to
all
of
the
data
systems
across
the
country.
it
is
unlike
any
other
sort
of
information
that
mr.
roy
offered
to
give
us.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
not
unless
the
court
has
any
questions,
mr.
justice.
