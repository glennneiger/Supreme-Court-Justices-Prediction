justice
harry
a.
blackmun
professor
gildin,
get
me
on
the
track.
this
injunction
was
not
only
against
the
acquisition
of
a
social
security
number
which
the
government
has
now,
but
also
against
the
government's
use
of
it.
am
i
correct
in
that?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
right
does
little
bird
of
the
snow
or
her
parents
who
do
not
object
to
the
use
of
their
own
social
security
numbers
have
to
prevent
the
government
from
using
information
it
has?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
granting
all
that,
there
is
a
number
outstanding,
and
the
government
has
it.
now,
what
right
do
the
roys
have
to
prevent
the
government
from
making
use
of
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
is
on
the
child's
religion,
not
on
the
parents',
because
apparently
they
are
not
concerned
about
the
use
of
their
own
social
security
numbers.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
that
one's
religious
belief
can
dictate
what
somebody
else
does
with
information
in
his
possession.
