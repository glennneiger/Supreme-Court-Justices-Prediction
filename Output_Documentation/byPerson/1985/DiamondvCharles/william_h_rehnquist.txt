justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
carey,
what
about
our
case
of
singleton
against
wulff,
decided
in
1976,
where
a
majority
of
the
court
held
that
doctors
could
raise
not
only
their
own
rights,
but
the
rights
of
their
patients?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
doesn't
he
alleged
similar
financial
interests
to
those
of
the
doctors
in
singleton?
