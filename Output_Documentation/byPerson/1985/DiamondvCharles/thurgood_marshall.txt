justice
thurgood
marshall
was
he
on
the
notice
of
appeal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
my
whole
point
is,
how
can
he
be
here
if
he's
not
on
the
notice
of
appeal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
can
he
be
before
this
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
qualified
to
give
us
the
position
of
the
state
of
illinois?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
is
the
position
of
the
state
now,
and
how
do
you
know?
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
we
rule
in
this
case
that
we
decided
on
your
assurance
of
what
the
law
is
in
the
state
of
illinois
and
what
the
state
of
illinois
intends
to
do?
in
other
words,
you
can't
give
us
any
one
word
of
authority
from
the
state
of
illinois?
justice
thurgood
marshall
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
exactly
does
the
state
of
illinois
authorize
you
to
say?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
we
don't
need
you
for
that,
do
we?
we
can
read
the
brief.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
brief
would
be
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
right.
and
if
you
can't
represent
the
state
of
illinois,
what
is
before
us
is
exactly
nothing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
right?
