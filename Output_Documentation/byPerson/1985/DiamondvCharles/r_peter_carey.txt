mr.
r.
peter
carey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
an
attempt
to
promote
the
state's
theory
of
fetal
life,
the
illinois
statute
unconstitutionally
overrides
the
physician's
obligation
to
protect
the
life
and
health
of
a
woman
needing
medical
care,
and
further,
requires
a
physician
to
deliver
a
morally
charged
and
medically
inaccurate
message
based
upon
the
state's
theory
of
life
to
patients
seeking
contraceptive
advice.
the
legal
questions
raised
in
this
appeal
were
correctly
settled
by
the
seventh
circuit's
application
of
the
principles
enunciated
in
roe,
colautti,
and
akron.
intervenor's
continuation
of
the
conflict
in
this
court
reflects
only
his
refusal
to
abide
by
constitutional
limits
on
state
authority
and
his
refusal
to
accept
prior
decisions
of
this
court.
intervenor's
desire
to
impose
his
personal
antipathy
against
abortion
on
physicians
and
women
does
not
cure
the
unconstitutional
deficiencies
of
this
statute
or
establish
article
3
jurisdiction.
illinois'
attorney
general
has
not
filed
a
notice
of
appeal
from
the
seventh
circuit's
decision,
nor,
contrary
to
the
intervenor's
initial
representation,
did
the
attorney
general
join
in
the
jurisdictional
statement.
after
this
court
noted
probable
jurisdiction,
the
attorney
general
for
illinois
did
not
file
a
brief
in
this
court,
nor
did
he
request
to
be
heard
at
oral
argument.
i
might
also
add
that
i
am
aware
of
nothing
that
authorizes
mr.
horan
to
speak
for
the
state
of
illinois,
either
its
attorney
general
or
any
of
the
state's
attorneys
who
are
charged
with
prosecuting
violations
of
this
statute
in
the
102
counties
in
illinois.
mr.
r.
peter
carey
yes.
your
honor,
that's
correct.
but
in
that
case
the
challenge
was
to
a
statute
which
impacted
on
the
physician.
here
we
have,
if
you
will,
the
reverse.
we
have
a
private
citizen
of
illinois
coming
in
and
attempting
to
uphold
a
criminal
statute
which
regulates
an
area
in
which
he
doesn't
practice.
if
the
statute
were
upheld,
he
wouldn't
be
subject
to
prosecution
under
it.
he
doesn't
perform
abortions
or
give
birth
control
devices.
mr.
r.
peter
carey
the
financial
interests
that
are
alleged
by
dr.
diamond
are
extremely
attenuated.
his
situation
is
much
more
akin,
i
think,
to
this
court's
decision
in
linda
r.s.
versus
robert
d.,
where
you
recall
that
a
mother
sought
to
overturn
texas'
interpretation
of
their
statute
which
texas
said
didn't
apply
to
the
collection
of
child
support
from
fathers
of
illegitimate
children,
but
only
to
fathers
of
legitimate
children.
she
brought
suit
and
this
court
found
that
even
if
the
statute
were
changed
or
found
to
be
unconstitutional
as
she
suggested,
the
thought
would
be
only
that
these
fathers
would
be
subject
to
prosecution,
not
that
child
support
would
reach
her.
and
the
same
is
true
here.
the
attorney
general's
participation--
mr.
r.
peter
carey
--i
might
say
i'd
like
to
know
how
he
can
have
it
both
ways.
but
there
is
a
distinction,
in
that
the
decision
of
the
district
court
on
fees
is
not
final.
in
fact,
it's
recently
been
subject
to
briefing.
the
position
of
the
district
court
as
i
understood
it
was
that
the
award
of
fees
was
joint
and
several
amongst
all
defendants,
with
the
defendants
intervenors
having
one-half
of
the
total
fee
award.
the
district
court
noted
in
its
decision
on
fees
that
it
was
concerned
because
of
what
it
viewed
as
the
dilatory
tactics
that
were
engaged
in
by
intervenors
the
litigation.
mr.
r.
peter
carey
no,
i
think
that's
not
quite
right.
he
chose
to
intervene
in
the
case.
he
chose
to
participate
in
the
case
actively.
he
exposed
himself
knowingly
to
the
possibility
of
fees
being
assessed
against
him.
mr.
r.
peter
carey
no,
i'm
not,
and
in
fact
that's
exactly
the
argument
they
are
making
to
the
district
court
at
this
very
time.
they
recently
filed
a
memorandum
which
i
received
yesterday
evening
in
the
district
court
on
the
fee
question.
the
district
court
had
asked
that
the
parties
brief
rather
the
applicability
of
graham.
and
they
point
out
to
the
court
that
their
interests
are
simply
the
same
as
the
interests
of
the
state
parties,
but
that
doesn't
convert
this
otherwise
private
parties
as
state
actors
and
provides
no
basis
for
the
award
of
fees
under
section
1988.
the
attorney
general's
participation
in
this--
mr.
r.
peter
carey
--no,
your
honor.
excuse
me,
but
the
state
through
the
attorney
general
was
before
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
r.
peter
carey
and
the
state
is
not
before
this
court.
so
at
the
time
that
the
appeal
was
decided,
and
indeed
at
the
time
of
the
entry
of
the
preliminary
and
final
injunction
in
the
district
court,
the
state
through
both
the
attorney
general
and
the
state's
attorney
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
appellate
court
through
both
of
those
as
well
was
actively
in
the
case
and
trying
to
uphold
the
statute.
they
are
not
before
this
court,
however.
just
as
the
state
of
new
jersey
in
princeton
versus
schmid
did
not
give
any
indication
as
to
how
the
case
should
be
resolved...
that
case
involved
the
constitutionality
of
a
new
jersey
statute
as
applied
to
a
person
who
had
leafletted
on
princeton's
campus,
and
the
court
found
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction...
so
the
state's
lack
of
a
position
on
the
merits
of
this
case
or
any
indication
of
its
preference
for
disposition
of
any
of
the
issues
in
this
case
requires
dismissal.
intervenor
has
no
legally
cognizable
interest.
he
simply
desires
that
the
state
enact,
uphold
and
enforce
unconstitutional
laws
which
reflect
his
view
that
life
begins
at
fertilization
and
which
impair
the
exercise
of
women's
constitutional
privacy
rights.
turning
to
the
statute
itself,
section
210
and
11(d)
represent
the
state's
attempt
to
dissuade
women
from
using
certain
types
of
birth
control
by
establishing
the
theory
that
life
begins
at
fertilization
and
then
requiring
the
physician
to
espouse
that
theory
to
his
patients
seeking
contraceptive
advice.
the
state
accomplishes
this
by
defining
"human
being"
as
a
fertilized
ovum,
then
defining
"fetus"
as
a
human
being
from
fertilization
until
live
birth.
210
as
any
drug
or
device
which
causes
fetal
death,
whether
or
not
the
fetus
is
known
to
exist.
then
we
have
11(b)
which
requires
the
physician
to
advise
patients
receiving
stilbestrol
and
iud's
and
certain
birth
control
devices
that
they
are
not
contraceptives,
but
are
rather
abortifacients,
a
term
which
is
defined
in
this
very
statute
as
causing
fetal
death,
whether
or
not
the
fetus
is
known
to
exist.
mr.
r.
peter
carey
he
is
correct
in
the
sense
that
the
statute
does
not
say,
when
we
use
iud's
and
des.
but
i
think
that
the
record
evidence
is
uncontradicted
by
the
affidavits
of
the
plaintiff
physicians
that
their
reading
of
the
definition
of
210
and
the
incorporated
definitions
of
iud's
and
stibestrol
are
covered.
mr.
r.
peter
carey
i
believe
that
the
district
court
did
find
that,
yes,
and
that
the
seventh
circuit
agreed
with
that.
the
conclusion
that
the
physicians
reached,
that
iud's
and
des
are
subject
to
the
provisions
of
210
and
11(d),
is
not
rebutted
by
the
intervenor's
suggestion
in
his
brief
in
this
court
to
the
contrary
or
by
anything
in
the
evidence.
210
and
11(d),
contrary
to
intervenor's
contention,
are
not
informed
consent.
these
provisions
do
not
advise
the
woman
of
what
is
to
be
done
or
its
consequences.
rather,
these
provisions
require
that
physicians
provide
all
women,
regardless
of
their
circumstances,
with
medically
irrelevant
information.
it
is
intervenor,
not
the
medical
profession,
who
seeks
to
deceive
women
who
need
medically
accurate
information
regarding
birth
control.
indeed,
the
patient
information
brochure
which
is
required
by
federal
regulation
to
be
given
to
women
contains
medically
accurate
information
regarding
the
health
risks
and
consequences
of
iud's,
des,
and
oral
contraceptives.
contrary
to
210
and
11(d),
this
federally
mandated
information
clearly
informs
the
woman
that
none
of
these
drugs
or
devices
will
cause
an
abortion
or
terminate
a
pregnancy.
moreover,
the
availability
of
this
information
to
the
woman
undercuts
intervenor's
undocumented
insinuations
that
the
medical
profession
is
engaged
in
wholesale
deception
of
women.
finally,
intervenor's
interpretation
of
this
statute
that
physicians
are
free
to
use
value-neutral
language
to
comply
with
it
is
contrary
to
the
express
statutory
language,
ignores
the
coercive
force
of
the
criminal
statute,
and
is
inconsistent
with
the
position
advanced
by
intervenor
in
the
briefs.
the
word
"abortifacient"
necessarily
signifies
an
abortion,
which
necessarily
presumes
the
existence
of
a
pregnancy.
surely
this
word
will
often
need
explanation,
and
just
as
surely
physicians
will
avoid
the
possibility
of
prosecution
by
using
the
statutory
explanation,
"causing
fetal
death".
section
6-4
is
directly
contrary
to
this
court's
prior
holdings
in
danforth
and
colautti
because
it
burdens
the
abortion
decision
and
its
effectuation
prior
to
viability.
the
fetal
standard
of
care
applies
when
the
physician
determines
there
exists
a
possibility
of
sustained
survival,
a
possibility,
not
a
reasonable
likelihood.
a
similar
standard
of
care
was
found
unconstitutional
in
danforth
because
it
applied
prior
to
viability.
likewise,
this
provision
applies
before
there
is
a
reasonable
likelihood
of
sustained
fetal
survival
and
must,
for
that
reason,
be
unconstitutional.
intervenor's
suggestion
to
the
contrary
is
refuted
by
the
existence
of
section
6-1,
which
clearly
applies
after
viability
and
establishes
the
same
standard
of
care.
also,
their
suggestion
is
controverted
by
the
language
of
6-4.
the
6-4
necessarily
suggests
that
it
applies
to
a
time
before
viability.
moreover,
if
there
is
any
doubt
on
this
question,
then
6-4
is
unconstitutionally
vague
under
this
court's
decision
in
colautti,
for
according
to
intervenor
this
condition
which
the
state
is
attempting
to
govern
by
section
6-4
differs
in
some
indeterminate
way
from
viability
as
set
forth
by
this
court
in
roe
and
danforth.
finally,
as
with
section
6-1,
section
6-4's
standard
of
care
is
impermissibly
vague.
turning
then
to
section
6-1,
this
is
the
post-viability
standard
of
care
provision,
very
much
like
the
one
in
danforth
and
very
much
like
the
one
in
colautti.
it
is
vague
in
at
least
two
ways,
each
of
which
is
sufficient
to
sustain
the
decision
below.
first,
the
statute
does
not
clearly
specify
the
attending
physician's
viability
determination
controls.
second,
the
statute
fails
to
inform
the
physician
that
the
woman's
life
or
health
is
preeminent
to
the
fetus
when
they
conflict.
turning
to
the
first
of
these,
this
section,
unlike
section
6-4,
applies
when
the
fetus
is
known
to
be
viable.
this
phrase
was
added
after
the
district
court
in
wynn
versus
scott
had
construed
section
6-1
to
leave
the
viability
determination
to
the
attending
physician's
judgment.
section
6-1
thus
allows
the
state
to
question
the
correctness
of
the
viability
determination
in
a
later
criminal
prosecution.
intervenor
concedes
that
the
state
cannot
constitutionally
do
so
under
colautti,
but
argues
instead
that
the
"known
to
be"
phrase
means
known
by
the
attending
physician
to
be.
intervenor's
construction
is
contrary
to
the
express
statutory
language
used
by
the
legislature
to
limit
the
viability
determination
to
the
attending
federal
in
section
6-4.
additionally,
the
intervenor
construes
the
6-1
than
the
meaning
which
he
attributes
to
that
phrase
in
the
first
sentence
of
6-1,
thereby
illustrating
the
vagueness
of
that
phrase.
alternatively,
if
physicians
and
assistants
are
not
bound
by
the
physician's
viability
determination,
chaos
will
occur
as
each
assistant
attempts
to
avoid
criminal
prosecution
by
acting
contrary
to
the
physician's
instructions
where
the
physician
has
determined
that
the
fetus
is
not
viable.
women
who
receive
post-viability
abortions
do
so
because
their
life
or
health
is
threatened.
this
statute
does
not
clearly
specify
that
the
woman's
life
and
health
are
preeminent
from
the
decision
of
whether
or
not
to
have
an
abortion
through
its
effectuation.
contrary
to
intervenor's
suggestion,
this
problem
is
not
solved
by
section
6-5.
section
6-5
does
not
provide
the
protection
of
the
woman's
life
and
health
which
the
intervenor
claims.
section
6-5
simply
doesn't
make
the
woman's
life
and
health
preeminent.
it
applies
by
its
own
words
only
during
the
course
of
the
pregnancy
termination,
a
point
after
which
the
choice
of
abortion
techniques
has
already
occurred.
choice
of
abortion
technique,
as
this
court
recognized
in
colautti,
is
a
complicated
medical
judgment,
about
which
physicians
can
and
do
disagree.
intervenor's
unsupported
assertion
that
certain
techniques
were
developed
to
injure
fetuses
ignores
the
fact
that
these
same
techniques
reduce
risks
to
women
whose
life
and
health
is
threatened
in
a
post-viability
abortion
situation.
the
distress
to
the
fetus
in
this
situation,
the
threat
to
the
woman,
the
skills
of
the
physician,
and
the
varying
side
effects
and
complications
of
each
of
these
techniques
makes
compliance
with
6-1
impossible;
and,
as
the
uncontroverted
affidavits
state,
6-1
does
not
present
to
them
a
clear
understanding
of
what
physician
conduct
is
considered
criminal.
although
the
intervenor
suggests
to
the
contrary,
the
words
6-5.
rather,
section
6-5
applies
when
the
physician
determines
that
to
follow
the
dictates
of
section
6-1
would
cause
increased
medical
risk
to
the
woman.
the
difference
in
language
necessarily
creates
vagueness.
illinois
uses
the
health
and
life
standard
to
control
the
availability
of
post-viability
abortions.
by
not
using
that
standard
in
6-5,
it
intended
to
somehow
limit
the
factors
which
the
physician
had
available
to
him
to
consider
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
apply
the
6-1
standard.
a
reaffirmance
of
colautti's
requirement
that
when
fetal
and
maternal
interests
conflict
the
physician
must
be
allowed
to
consider
the
woman's
health
and
life
preeminent
in
making
post-viability
abortion
decisions
is
necessary
because,
if
i
may
say
so,
some
including
illinois
have
not
followed
that
decision.
starting
with
griswold
and
most
recently
in
akron,
this
court
consistently
has
recognized
the
woman's
right
to
personal
autonomy
in
reproductive
matters.
these
prior
decisions
are
dispositive
of
the
issues
in
this
case.
sections
210
and
11(d)
cannot
be
reconciled
with
akron's
prohibition
of
criminal
regulation
designed
to
deter
reproductive
choices.
sections
6-1
and
6-4
cannot
be
reconciled
with
colauti's
prohibition
of
vague
statutes
that
require
trade-offs
between
a
woman's
health
and
that
of
the
fetus.
none
of
the
provisions
can
be
reconciled
with
roe's
clear
affirmation
that
the
constitutional
right
of
privacy
cannot
be
vitiated
by
the
state's
theory
of
life.
for
these
reasons
and
those
in
our
brief,
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed
or
on
the
article
3
point
this
appeal
should
be
dismissed.
unless
the
court
has
any
other
questions,
thank
you.
