justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
not
true
that
in
those
cases
the
state
had
also
appeared
as
a
party?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
is
the
first
time
we
have
had
nobody
except
an
intervening
doctor,
isn't
it,
on
this
side
of
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
help
me
a
little
bit.
i
understand
you
rely
very
heavily
on
the
fact
you've
been
hit
rather
heavily
with
a
fee
award
in
the
lower
court,
and
of
course
you
do
have
an
interest
in
that.
if
there
were
not
the
fee
in
the
case,
do
you
think
you'd
have
standing
independently?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
the
court
of
appeals
recently
disagreed
with
those
holdings.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean
on
a
similar
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
in
any
event,
what
is
the
theory
on
which,
apart
from
the
fee
question,
a
doctor
who
is
interested
in
the
cause
that
you
represent
has
standing
to
litigate
in
a
case
like
this?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let's
stop
with
that
one
just
for
a
minute.
what
is
the
nature
of
his
interest
as
a
parent?
does
he
allege
that
his
daughter
is
apt
to
have
an
abortion
or
anything
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
can't
tell
his
own
daughter
this
information?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
a
realistic
probability
of
something
like
this
happening?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
no
one
has
exercised
that
power
of
appointment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
may
i
also
ask,
you
suggested
the
attorney
general
was
inadvertent
in
failing
to
file
a
notice
of
appeal.
but
surely
he
had
plenty
of
time
to
file
a
brief
on
the
merits.
that
can't
be
attributed
to
inadvertence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
horan,
may
i
ask
on
the
attorney
fee
point
that
you
mentioned,
the
$100,000
liability.
i
understand
you
contest
that
fee
award.
do
you
contest
both
the
amount
of
the
fee
and
do
you
also
take
the
position
you're
not
really
liable
for
any
fees
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
assume
you
take
that
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that.
but
in
addition,
i
suppose
you
claim
that
as
intervenors
you're
probably
not
liable
for
fees
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
i
suppose
we
could
save
you
$100,000
by
ruling
you
have
no
business
in
this
litigation
at
all.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question
about
the
statute,
mr.
horan.
in
your
reply
brief
you
state
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
the
suggestion
that
an
iud
or
stilbestrol
is
an
abortifacient
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
does
the
statute
itself
or
the
legislative
history
or
anything
in
the
record
identify
any
drugs
or
devices
that
are
properly...
that
a
doctor
should
know
are
in
fact,
whatever
the
term
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
it
entirely
up
to
the
doctor
to
decide
for
himself
whether
a
particular
drug
or
device
is
such
a
device
within
the
meaning
of
the
act?
how
does
the
doctor
know?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
would
it
be
a
defense
under
the
statute
for
a
doctor
always
to
say,
well,
i
didn't
realize
this
was
an
abortifacient?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
horan,
do
you
contend
that
the
changes
were
mandated
by
ashcroft?
you
said
they
were
trying
to
comply.
if
so,
it
seems
to
me,
perhaps
without
intending
to
do
so,
you're
suggesting
that
perhaps
the
old
version
would
have
been
invalid
under
ashcroft.
justice
john
paul
stevens
another
way
of
putting
it,
i
suppose,
is
that
if
there's
no
decision
on
the
old
version
of
6-4
and
6-1
the
legislature
would
remain
free
in
your
view
to
re-enact
those
statutes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
then,
it
really
doesn't
make
much
difference
what
we
do
with
the
old,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
saying
that
the
argument
against
the
pennsylvania
statute
doesn't
apply
to
this
statute,
the
argument
we
just
earlier?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
on
the
standing
question,
how
can
you
consistently
take
the
position
here
that
there's
no...
you
really
don't
have
an
adversary,
and
yet
if
what
your
opponent
told
us
is
correct,
you
asked
for
$100,000
from
him
in
the
district
court
on
the
ground
that
he
was
your
adversary?
how
can
you
have
it
both
ways?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
would
you
not
agree
that
as
a
normal
proposition,
if
he
has
no
standing
to
litigate,
which
i
understand
to
be
your
position,
you
certainly
shouldn't
have
standing
to
get
fees
from
him?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
going
to
get...
presumably,
if
you
win
you
get
some
kind
of
an
injunction
against
the
state
of
illinois
enforcing
the
statute.
you're
not
going
to
get
any
relief
against
these
people,
are
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
carey,
your
opponent
says
that
the
statute
doesn't
define
either
stilbestrol
or
iud
as
one
of
these
devices.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
a
finding
to
that
effect?
