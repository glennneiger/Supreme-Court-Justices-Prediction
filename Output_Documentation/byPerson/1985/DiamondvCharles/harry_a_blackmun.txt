mr.
horan,
again
a
matter
of
curiosity.
you
started
the
case
off
with
a
man
named
campbell
as
a
plaintiff.
when
did
he
get
off
the
train?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
one
of
your
original
plaintiffs
was
named
campbell.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
you
don't
even
name
him
here
as
an
appellant.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
are
you
representing
him?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
how
can
you...
he
is
not
a
party
before
this
court?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
thank
you.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
are
you
still
representing
him
here?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
did
the
state
itself
take
an
appeal
to
the
seventh
circuit?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you're
sure
about
that?
