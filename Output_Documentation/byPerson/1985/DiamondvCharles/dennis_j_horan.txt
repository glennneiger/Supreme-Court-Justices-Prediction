mr.
dennis
j.
horan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
final
judgment
of
the
seventh
circuit,
an
appeal
brought
by
the
intervening
defendants
in
that
case.
the
first
issue
of
the
case
is
one
that
has
been
raised
in
the
briefs
about
the
standing
of
the
intervening
defendants
to
bring
this
appeal
under
the
doctrine
of
case
of
controversy.
three
things
happened
below:
there
was
a
declaratory
judgment;
where
was
an
injunction;
and
there
was
a
judgment
against
the
individual
intervenors
for
$100,000
for
legal
fees.
the
liability
for
the
judgment
will
be
appealed
to
the
seventh
circuit,
but
the
amount
of
the
judgment
can
only
be
litigated
here
because
it's
intertwined
with
the
issues
in
this
case,
that
is
to
say,
who
is
the
prevailing
party
on
these
issues.
if
this
court
reverses
the
seventh
circuit,
then
the
amount
of
the
judgment
will
be
lessened
since
they
no
longer
are
the
prevailing
parties
on
the
issues
before
this
court.
the
standing
or
the
real
controversy
thus
between
the
parties
to
this
case
is
a
very
real
sum
of
money,
a
judgment
that
runs
in
favor
of
the
individual
plaintiff
physicians
in
this
case
and
against
the
individual
defendants
intervenors
whom
i
represent.
they
represent,
therefore,
a
far
greater
stake,
one
might
say,
in
the
outcome
of
this
case
than
the
intervening
appellants
in
bryant
versus
yellin,
who
were
given
standing
to
appeal
on
the
basis
of
the
water
problem
that
existed
in
the
imperial
valley
on
the
problem
that
existed
in
the
imperial
valley
on
the
standing
argument
that
they
desired
to
purchase
farmlands
in
the
imperial
valley
if
farmland
should
become
available
because
of
the
application
of
46
in
that
case.
no
one
was
required
to
sell,
but
standing
to
appeal
was
nonetheless
granted
for
purposes
of
the
appeal
on
the
mere
probability
that
someone
might
sell
below
market
depending
upon
the
outcome
of
section
46.
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
pardon
me,
judge?
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
campbell.
he
is
still
in
the
case
technically.
there
has
been
no
order
dismissing
him
and
no
order
removing
him
from
the
case.
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
yes.
technically,
he
is
in
the
case;
as
far
as
all
the
parties
are
concerned,
he
has
been
removed.
it
is
not
too
different
from
what
you
heard
in
a
previous
argument.
thus
the
litigants
here,
the
intervening--
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
i'd
have
to
check
the
notice
of
appeal,
your
honor.
i'm
not
quite
sure.
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
if
he's
not
on
the
notice
of
appeal,
then
he
is
not
a
party
before
this
court.
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
i
corrected,
your
honor.
i
say
that
if
he
is
not
on
the
notice
of
appeal,
which
it
appears
he
is
not,
he
is
not
a
party
before
this
court.
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
the
judgment,
however,
is
joint
and
several
against
all
three
of
the
individuals
that
i
represent.
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
he
is
not
a
party
before
this
court.
i
would
have
to
retract
and
say
therefore
he
is
not
represented
before
this
court.
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
the
intervening
defendants
therefore
state
a
very
real
interest
which
assures
that
the
case
will
be
litigated
vigorously
in
an
adversary
context
and
in
a
form
this
court--
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
--there
are
many
intervenors
who
have
appeared
before
this
court--
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
--i'm
trying
to
think
of
the
title
of
the
cases
that
have
been
argued
before
this
court
where
intervenors
have
argued,
for
example,
on
the
parental
consent
cases,
have
all
appeared
before
this
court
and
argued
and
this
court
has
granted
standing.
perhaps
it
was
not
a
specific
issue
in
those
cases,
but
nonetheless
they
did
appear
as
intervenors,
did
appeal,
and
did
appear
before
this
court
in
argument.
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
yes,
judge.
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
williams
versus
zebares
is
one,
from
the
state
of
illinois,
where
we
intervened
and
appeared
and
argued
before
this
court.
we
also
argued
in
harris
versus
mcrae.
those
were
state
statutes
and--
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
--that
was
not
a
criminal
statute.
akron
was
a
criminal
statute
which
involved
intervention.
allen
sejudi,
as
i
recall,
represented
the
intervenors
in
those
cases
and
argued
before
this
court
on
behalf
of
intervenors,
asserting
interests
in
the
parental
consent
and
in
other
sections
of
those
statutes.
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
the
state
had
also
appeared,
that
is
correct.
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
this
may
be
the
first
time
in
that
sense,
yes,
judge.
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
yes,
judge.
we
have
asserted
interests
as
intervenors
which
have
twice
been
ruled
on
by
the
trial
court
and
twice
they
have
found
that
they
are
fundamental
and
substantial.
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
no,
that
was
not
as
to
the
individuals
in
this
case.
that
was
as
to--
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
--no,
that
was
as
to
the
ability
of
an
organization,
not
individuals
who
asserted
a
specific
interest.
the
organization
was
a
different...
came
under
a
different
rule
of
law.
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
he
has
standing
to
litigate
the
standards
of
medical
practice
that
ought
to
be
applied.
he
has
the
standing
to
litigate
interests
in
individuals
such
as
his
daughter,
who
would
have
an
interest
in
the
outcome
of
the
section
210
and
11(d).
he
has
an
interest
that
he
can--
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
--no.
but
it
is
possible
that
his
daughter
might
be
involved
with
a
physician
who
is
prescribing
something
that
in
effect
is
an
abortifacient,
and
consequently
under
210
and
11(d)
he
would
have
an
interest
in
seeing
to
it
that
the
standard
is
applied
which
requires
the
physician
to
reveal
to
that
person--
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
--he
might
not
be
involved
in
the
situation
where
his
daughter
is
obtaining
such
a
drug
or
device
from
another
physician.
that's
why
the--
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
--yes.
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
in
the
court
below
and
before
the
seventh
circuit,
the
state
was
a
party,
did
litigate
the
issues,
and
we
jointly
filed
joint
briefs,
so
that
the
position
of
the
state
on
each
one
of
these
issues
was
stated
in
those
briefs.
the
attorney
general
has
filed
a
statement
with
this
court
under
rule
10.4
that
he
does
have
an
interest
in
the
outcome
of
this
case.
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
yes.
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
yes.
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
because
the
state
filed
a
letter
which
was
referred
to
in
the
brief
of
the
appellees
and
a
copy
of
which
is
an
appendix
to
our
reply
brief,
stating
that
they
have
an
interest
in
the
outcome
of
the
case.
they
did
not
state
the
reason
why
they
did
not
file
a
notice
of
appeal.
my
understanding
is
that
the
reason
was
simple
inadvertence.
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
one
would
have
to
divide
that--
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
--not
quite.
one
would
have
to
divide--
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
--it
authorizes
us
or
me
to
say
what
it
authorized
to
be
said
in
the
court
below
when
we
did
file
the
joint
briefs.
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
if
i
weren't
here
there'd
be
nobody
here.
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
i'm
afraid
they
wouldn't,
because
if
i
weren't
here
the
appeal
wouldn't
be
here.
that's
the
very
point.
that's
why
we're
here.
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
well,
there
is
a
provision
in--
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
--no,
i
disagree
respectfully,
justice.
there
is
a
provision
in
the
illinois
state
statutes.
it's
section
6.
the
appellees
cited
it,
section
2.
section
5
allows
any
court
in
which
a
proceeding
is
taking
place
in
which
the
attorney
general
if
illinois
has
an
interest
that,
in
the
event
he
is
absent,
that
court
could
appoint
any
competent
attorney
as
the
attorney
general
for
the
purposes
of
that
proceeding.
it
requires
mere
absence.
that
is
to
say,
the
interest--
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
--no
one
has
exercised
that.
i
respectfully--
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
--no.
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
it
cannot,
and
i
cannot
give
a
reason
why
that
was
not
done.
i
do
suggest,
however,
that
unlike
bryant
versus
yellin
that
i
relied
on
so
heavily,
in
bryant
the
solicitor
general
and
the
department
of
the
interior
took
a
position
on
the
merits.
they
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
appeal
was
unwarranted,
and
this
was
a
matter
of
record.
and
the
court
here
did
not
find
that
any
bar
to
allowing
those
private
citizens
to
prosecute
that
appeal,
and
indeed
to
win
the
case.
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
we
contest--
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
--yes,
judge.
we
contest
the
amount,
but
the
amount
can
only
be
contested
here
because
it's
intertwined--
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
--yes.
but
thus
far
that
has
not
been
very
successful.
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
to
say
the
least.
if
i
may,
we
can
move
on
to
section
210
and
11(d),
which
is
the--
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
--the
other
suggestion
i
had
was
that
our
opponents
could
stand
up
and
attempt
to
defeat
this
argument,
which
may
be
described
as
bootstrap.
they
could
stand
up
and
waive
all
fees.
that's
a
suggestion
for
them.
210
and
11(d)
require
that
a
physician
who
is
going
to
prescribe
an
abortifacient
advise
the
woman
that
it
is
indeed
an
abortifacient.
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
protect
women
who
do
not
want
an
abortion,
and
this
court
has
indicated
that
that
is
as
fundamental
a
right
as
it
is
to
decide
to
have
an
abortion.
the
right
cannot
be
exercised
by
the
woman
if
indeed
she
does
not
know
that
the
drug
or
device
being
administered
to
her
is
an
abortifacient.
that's
the
first
prerequisite.
the
statute
applies
if
and
only
if
the
doctor
knows
that
the
drug
or
device
is
an
abortifacient
and
the
drug
or
device
is
in
fact
an
abortifacient,
and
yet
he
intentionally
disregards
that
and
prescribes
it
to
the
woman
without
indicating
that
it
is
such.
conviction
is
a
class
c
misdemeanor,
which
incidentally
is
the
lowest
class
misdemeanor
under
illinois
law,
illinois
criminal
law.
and
a
conviction
of
a
class
c
misdemeanor
is
not
grounds
for
revocation
or
suspension
of
a
physician's
license.
the
statute
represents
the
state
of
illinois'
assertion
of
its
legitimate
right
to
assure
awareness
of
the
abortion
decision
and
its
significance,
as
this
court
said
it
constitutionally
could
do
so
in
danforth.
a
physician
does
not
have
a
right,
constitutional
or
otherwise,
to
prescribe
medication
without
indicating
to
the
person
to
whom
it
is
prescribed
the
risks
attendant
to
it.
the
statute
places
no
burden
whatsoever
in
the
path
of
a
woman
who
wishes
to
secure
an
abortion.
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
no,
judge.
this
was
a
facial
attack
and
the
specific
items
to
which
you're
referring
have
never
been
brought
into
evidence
in
this
case.
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
there
is
both
a
subjective
and
an
objective
standard.
the
subjective
standard
requires
his
knowledge.
objectively,
the
item
must
in
fact
be
such,
must
be
recognized
as
such
when
used
in
the
customary
means
for
which
it
was
produced.
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
if
it's
done
in
good
faith,
it
would
be
a
defense.
there
is
no
burden
on
any
woman
seeking
an
abortion.
the
statute
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
its
intent
and
purpose
is
to
protect
the
woman
who
does
not
want
an
abortion.
i
think
that's
essential
here
in
deciding
its
constitutionality.
in
maher,
for
example,
this
court
pointed
out
that
a
woman
has
at
least
an
equal
right
to
choose
to
carry
her
fetus
to
term.
the
plaintiffs
have
raised
in
this
court
for
the
first
time
an
argument
that
the
imposition
of
the
statute
does
not
accord
with
good
medical
practice
or,
another
way
of
phrasing
it,
they
say
it
requires
false
information.
that's
another
issue
that
was
not
litigated.
in
their
cite
on
page
17
they
cite
to
williams
obstetrics
page
89.
a
review
of
page
89
indicates,
quite
the
contrary
from
the
assertion
of
the
argument,
that
the
information
that
the
state
requires
is
accurate
and
factual
and
medically
correct
and
in
accord
with
medical
practice.
the
seventh
circuit
weighed
heavily
on
the
argument
that
this
statute,
when
read
with
the
other
sections
of
the
statute,
required
the
physician
to
be
the
mouthpiece
of
the
state
as
to
a
certain
theory
of
life
which
it's
not
allowed
to
enunciate
under
roe
v.
wade.
and
i
may
digress
for
one
moment
to
point
out
that
in
this
case
here
it
is
our
contention
there
is
no
issue
concerning
roe
v.
wade,
ashcroft,
colautti,
or
any
of
the
other
cases,
but
that
they
are
properly
applied
under
our
view.
the
seventh
circuit
held
that
to
fulfil
the
requirement
of
the
statute
the
physician
would
have
to
talk
about
fetal
death,
and
under
the
definition
of
fetal
death
it
requires
that
he
look
to
the
definition
of
fetus,
which
means
human
being.
what
the
seventh
circuit
overlooked
was
that
at
the
time
it
wrote
the
decision
that
section
of
the
statute
had
been
amended,
section
2-6,
and
it
had
been
amended
to
read
that
"a
fetus
is
an
individual
organism
of
the
species
homo
sapiens
from
fertilization
until
live
birth.
"
which
as
far
as
i
think
humans
can
do
is
absolutely
neutral
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
we're
involved
with
a
human
being
at
that
stage.
i
think
it
was
a
rather
significant
omission
by
the
court
in
arriving
at
that
conclusion.
there
are
two
other
sections
of
the
statute,
and
i
must
refer
to
them
as
old
6-1
and
old
6-4
because
the
statute
was
amended,
and
the
new
amendments
we
refer
to
as
new
6-1
and
new
6-4
to
try
to
allay
a
little
of
the
confusion
that
the
amendments
caused.
incidentally,
the
seventh
circuit
found,
and
it's
true,
if
one
looks
at
the
history
of
abortion
legislation
in
the
state
of
illinois,
the
many
amendments,
the
changes
in
the
statute,
the
constantly
going
back
to
the
legislature
to
do
it
over
again,
one
would
find
out
that
they
correlate
pretty
well
with
the
opinions
of
this
court.
and
many
of
the
sections
of
this
statute
are
the
way
they
are
because
of
the
time
that
ashcroft
was
passed
and
the
state
of
illinois
was
attempting
to
bring
its
law
in
conformity
with
ashcroft.
our
argument
below,
after
notifying
the
seventh
circuit
of
the
change
in
the
statute,
was
that
the
issues
with
regard
to
old
6-1
and
old
6-4
were
moot,
primarily
because
the
changes
were
substantial.
the
statute
was
narrowed.
different
standards
were
involved.
and
that
statute,
new
6-1
and
new
6-4,
is
the
subject
matter
of
a
separate
lawsuit
called
keith
versus
daley,
which
is
being
vigorously
litigated
below.
extensive
affidavits
have
been
filed,
briefs
have
been
filed.
it
is
the
subject
matter
of
an
agreed-to
between
the
state
and
the
litigants
preliminary
injunction,
and
is
undertaking
no
activity
until
this
case
is
decided.
so
new
6-1
and
new
6-4
are
in
a
separate
lawsuit
where
the
constitutionality
of
those
statutes
are
being
litigated.
now,
back
to
old
6-1
and
old
6-4.
the
seventh
circuit
addressed
those
statutes
even
though
the
challenge
to
them
and
the
standing
of
the
challenge
to
them
was
based
upon
the
potentiality
of
future
convictions.
in
fact,
6-4
had
been
enjoined
from
the
day
it
was
passed
until
the
day
it
was
amended
out
of
existence.
6-1
was
in
existence
for
only
eight
months,
so
that
when
the
seventh
circuit
dealt
with
this
issue
it
held
that,
because
of
the
possibility
of
future
prosecutions
against
these
physicians
for
the
eight-month
period
of
time
several
years
prior,
that
that
statute
was
not
moot.
and
it
therefore
held
that
the
statute
was
not
moot
and
reached
the
merits
on
the
issue.
our
position
is
then
and
is
now
that
under
the
teachings
of
this
court
that
statute
was
moot,
ought
not
to
have
been
addressed,
or
the
seventh
circuit
ought
to
have
remanded
in
the
same
case
to
consider
the
effect
of
the
new
amendments,
which
was
not
done.
the
plaintiffs
chose,
as
is
their
right,
to
file
a
separate
suit
and
litigate
those
issues
separately.
the
court
would
not
consolidate
the
cases
and
therefore
we
had
a
bifurcated
litigation
going
on,
which
ought
not
to
have
been
the
case
but
nonetheless
was.
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
only
with...
this
only
refers
to
6-1
and
6-4.
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
it
does
not
refer
to--
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
--dismiss
that
case
as
to
these
issues,
yes.
and
then
those
issues
will
be
litigated
in
the
new
case,
keith
versus
daley,
in
a
statute
much
more
narrowly
drawn
in
an
attempt,
and
a
good
attempt
i
think,
to
comply
with
ashcroft.
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
no,
i
don't
suggest
that.
i
suggest
that
what
was
done
in
ashcroft
was,
if
i
may
use
the
expression,
a
scheme
of
regulation
involving
two
physicians,
one
of
whom,
being
an
ob-gyn,
has
the
jurisdiction
up
until
the
time
of
birth,
the
other
of
whom,
being
the
pediatrician,
takes
over
the
jurisdiction
at
the
time
of
birth
forward.
there
being
two
individuals
involved,
ashcroft
has
tried
to
work
out
that
scheme
and
now
the
states
are
trying
to
follow
the
scheme
that's
outlined
in
ashcroft.
it
does
not
mean
that
the
separate
standard
that
was
set
out
in
6-1
was
indeed
unconstitutional.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
is
our
contention--
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
--no.
no,
judge.
it
would
be
purposeless,
because
new
6-1
and
new
6-4
represent
the
regulation
under
ashcroft.
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
no,
it
does
make
some
different
if
you
reach
the
old
one,
because
the
standard
of
care
is
not
that
dissimilar
in
terms
of
the
actual
standard
of
care
as
divided
amongst
the
two
physicians
that
i
have
just
described.
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
it
will
certainly
rub
off.
the
seventh
circuit,
incidentally,
had
previously
upheld
the
same
standard
of
care
that
6-1
contains.
the
eighth
circuit
and
the
lower
court
in
ashcroft
upheld
it
in
188.030.2
of
their
statutes.
you
remember
that
the
debate
here
was
on.3.
the.3
contained
two
provisions,
one
of
which
was
the
second
physician,
but
the
second
sentence
of.3,
which
was
upheld
by
this
court
by
implication
when
it
upheld
the
first
sentence,
the
second
sentence
contains
the
same
standard
of
care
as
6-1.
it
says
that:
"during
the
performance
of
the
abortion
the
physician
performing
it
and
subsequent
to
the
abortion
the
physician
required
by
this
section
to
be
in
attendance
shall
take
all
reasonable
steps
in
keeping
with
good
medical
practice
consistent
with
the
procedure
used
to
preserve
the
life
and
health
of
the
viable
unborn
child,
provided
that
that
does
not
pose
an
increased
risk
to
the
life
or
health
of
the
woman.
"
that
was
the
same
standard
that
was
contained
in
188.030.3,
which
was
the
subject
matter
of
the
ashcroft
case.
and
it's
that
standard
that
the
states
are
trying
to
enunciate
now
in
the
statutes
which
they
are
passing
and
which
illinois
has
done.
the
seventh
circuit
ruled
that
6-1
was
vague
because
6-1,
it
aid,
does
not
specify
who
must
make
the
viability
determination,
physician
or
assistant.
now,
to
come
to
that
conclusion
one
must
ignore
other
sections
of
the
statute,
namely
2-2,
which
defines
viability
as
a
medical
judgment
of
the
attending
physician
based
on
the
particular
facts
of
the
case
before
him.
if
one
reads
both
sections
together,
it's
quite
clear
that
it
is
the
attending
physician
who
makes
the
medical
judgment
of
viability.
6-1
is
a
post-viability
standard
of
care.
it
applies
only
after
viability
is
known
in
fact
and
applies
only
if
there
is
a
deliberate
disregard
of
the
fact
that
the
child
is
viable.
in
addition,
another
section,
6-5,
requires
that
there
be
absolutely
no
trade-off
in
terms
of
risk.
any
medical
risk
involved
vitiates
the
import
of
6-1.
that
is
to
say,
a
physician
need
not
follow
6-1
if
in
doing
so,
that
is
to
say
in
selecting
a
method
of
abortion
or
using
a
standard
of
care
to
save
the
viable
child,
it
would
in
any
way
increase
the
risk
to
the
woman.
there
is
no
trade-off
that
was
found
perhaps
to
be
inappropriate
under
colautti.
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
i
don't
have
an
opinion
on
that
case,
your
honor,
but
that
argument
certainly
does
not
apply
here.
the
standard
set
out
in
6-1
and
in
6-5,
read
in
conjunction
with
2-2,
certainly
is
not
vague.
it
identifies
for
any
reasonable
physician
reading
it
what
it
requires
and
let's
him
know
that
only
an
intentional
failure
to
exercise
that
standard
is
subject
to
prosecution
under
the
statute.
the
standard
is
a
common,
medically
accepted
standard,
and
really
causes
no
problem
for
physicians
to
understand.
old
6-4
is
another
post-viability
statute,
substantially
similar
to
the
one
i
have
just
described,
with
a
slight
difference.
it
does
not
use
the
word
"viability".
instead,
it
uses
a
statement
of
the
standard
that
comports
with
the
standard
adopted
in
roe.
it
says
when
there
exists
in
the
medical
judgment
of
the
physician
performing
the
pregnancy
termination,
based
on
the
particular
facts
of
the
case
before
him,
a
possibility
known
to
him
of
sustained
survival
of
the
fetus
apart
from
the
body
of
the
mother,
with
or
without
artificial
support.
the
statute
applies
after
viability
and
contains
a
different
standard,
a
possibility,
in
reference
to
the
subjective
judgment
made
by
the
attending
physician.
the
intent
of
this
section
is
to
sweep
under
the
protection
of
6-4
a
greater
number
of
viable
children
than
would
be
done
so
by
6-1.
if
6-4
is
constitutional,
6-1
is
obviously
so
and
6-4
would
be
the
standard
that
the
states
would
adopt.
the
seventh
circuit
held
6-4
unconstitutional
solely
on
the
basis
that
it
applied
to
pre-viability
abortions
and
therefore
has
a
chilling
effect.
it
does
not
apply
to
pre-viability
abortions
because
it
contains
word
by
word
the
standard
for
viability
that
this
court
adopted
in
roe.
the
word
"possibility"
can
only
be
interpreted
to
refer
to
the
subjective
quality
of
the
physician's
judgment,
asking
him
to
bring
into
the
sweep
of
the
statute's
protection
not
a
remote
possibility
of
viable
children
who
might
survive,
but
a
reasonable
possibility
of
children
who
might
survive.
mr.
dennis
j.
horan
thank
you.
