why
is
this
much
different
than
the
social
security
act
that
congress
passed
in
1937,
that
says
after
such
and
such
a
date
all
employers
pay
such
and
such
a
tax
for
every
covered
employee
that's
covered
by
it?
no
one
ever
had
had
any
opportunity
to
withdraw
from
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
haven't
we
held
that
some
tax
acts
can
be
retroactive?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
surely
the
power
to
tax
doesn't
give
the
government
the
power
to
take
property
without
just
compensation.
these
remedies
come...
the
act
you're
talking
about
here
comes
under
the
commerce
power,
and
the
commerce
power
doesn't
give
the
right
to
take
property
without
just
compensation.
but
it
seems
to
me
you've
got
to
deal
with
the
taxing
cases
if
you're
going
to
say
that
every
exaction
by
the
government
from
a
private
employer
is
potentially
a
taking
that
amounts
to
a
compensable
taking.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
many
of
those
had
retroactive
effect?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
before
we
get
to
that,
let
me
ask
you
a
question.
supposing
congress,
in
one
of
its
socioeconomic
moods
that
you
refer
to,
when
it
passed
the
fair
labor
standards
act
in
1938
said:
you
know,
we're
laying
down
minimum
wages
now,
but
we're
really
offended
by
what
these
businesses
have
been
paying
workers
in
the
past.
so
another
provision
they
add,
that
wasn't
in
the
bill
they
actually
passed
but
in
my
hypothetical:
that
you
pay
minimum
wages
for
the
last
five
years,
even
though,
regardless
of
what
your
contract
was.
now,
is
that
just
one
of
these
socioeconomic
things
that
adjusts
burdens
and
benefits
of
economic
life,
and
if
it's
rational
it's
okay?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they
didn't
receive
the
benefit
of
their
bargain
in
their
agreement
to
fund
the
trust
plan,
did
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you're
using
it
in
a
rather
specialized
sense.
