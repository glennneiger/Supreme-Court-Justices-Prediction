mr.
wayne
jett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
question
whether
a
federal
statute
which
creates
a
new
legal
obligation
requiring
one
private
party
to
pay
money
to
another
private
party
takes
property
in
violation
of
the
taking
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
this
statute,
known
as
erisa,
enacted
in
1974,
as
amended
in
1980,
requires
an
employer
who
ceases
participation
in
a
multiemployer
pension
trust
to
pay
money
to
the
pension
trust
in
amounts
computed
according
to
the
statute
as
withdrawal
liability.
the
essential
undisputed
fact
in
this
case
is
that
absent
the
statute
imposing
the
obligation,
the
employer
otherwise
would
have
no
obligation
to
pay
money
to
the
pension
trust.
under
the
statute,
the
obligation
to
pay
the
money
as
withdrawal
liability
is
triggered
when
the
employer
withdraws
or
ceases
to
have
an
obligation
to
contribute
to
the
pension
trust.
now,
in
practice
and
in
the
case
before
this
court,
this
means
that
the
employer
has
failed
to
enter
into
a
new
collective
bargaining
agreement
requiring
a
continued
contribution
into
the
pension
trust.
therefore,
in
effect,
if
there
is
no
ability
to
arrive
at
a
consensual
agreement
between
the
union
and
the
employer
which
includes
continued
contributions
into
the
pension
trust,
the
withdrawal
liability
taking
of
property
is
triggered.
mr.
wayne
jett
that
is
correct.
mr.
wayne
jett
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
wayne
jett
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
wayne
jett
that
was
under
the
1974
statute,
that
is
correct.
mr.
wayne
jett
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
it
was
resolved--
mr.
wayne
jett
--your
honor,
it
is
this
interest.
to
get
back
to
your
original
point,
the
statutory
interpretation
in
effect
was
resolved
against
us
before
the
1980
amendment.
when
the
1980
amendment
was
passed,
it
made
clear
that
congress
did
intend
to
include
this
type
of
plan
under
its
statute.
so
therefore
we
did
not
contest
the
interpretation
of
the
'74
statute
any
longer.
as
far
as
the
interest
that
the
trustees
have
in
the
plan,
under
the
statute
as
amended
the
statute
uses
the
board
of
trustees
as
its
instrumentality,
the
instrumentality
of
government
to
take
the
property.
it
is
true
that
the
property
is
taken
and
given
to
the
pension
trust.
nevertheless,
the
pension
trust,
when
it
is
being
used
by
this
statute
and
required
affirmatively
to
expend
its
own
funds
and
to
take
affirmative
action
to
collect
this
money,
we
believe
that
we
have
the
standing
to
say
that
when
this
property
is
coming
to
us
in
violation
of
constitutional
rights
we
have
the
standing
and
the
right
to--
mr.
wayne
jett
--well,
your
honor,
as
far
as
the
trust
and
the
relationship
between
the
trust
and
the
employer,
the
trust
agreement
establishes
the
trustees
as
responsible
for
the
administration
of
the
fund,
including
the
integrity
of
the
trust
document.
the
effect
of
the
statute
would
be
to
invalidate
substantial
provisions
of
the
trust
document.
the
trustees
are
responsible
for
caretaking
that
document
and
are
entitled
to
assert
the
constitutional
right
of
the
infirmity
of
the
statute
in
order
to
protect
those
provisions.
mr.
wayne
jett
your
honor--
mr.
wayne
jett
--the
trustees
have
assessed,
according
to
the
statute,
a
liability
against
the
particular
employer
who
has
intervened
in
this
case
and
against
other
employers
as
well.
the
intervenor
in
this--
mr.
wayne
jett
--the
premium
statute
requires
the
payment
of
premiums
by
the
trustee.
that
has
been--
mr.
wayne
jett
--that
is
correct.
mr.
wayne
jett
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
certainly
another
interest
that
we
have
in
it.
we
have
contested
that
and
we
have
done
so
since
the
1974
statute
was
passed.
we
believe
that
the
premium
provisions
of
the
statute
are
invalid
because
inseparable
from
the
withdrawal
liability
provisions--
mr.
wayne
jett
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
wayne
jett
yes,
it
is.
mr.
wayne
jett
woodward
sand
company
has
been
assessed
a
liability
of
something
in
excess
of
$200,000,
about
201,
i
believe,
thereabouts.
that
particular
assessment
relates
to...
or
has
been
taken
through
the
arbitration
procedure
and
the
amount
was
established
by
arbitration
as
provided
under
the
statute.
mr.
wayne
jett
there
has
not
been.
it
is
a
case
that
is
pending
in
court.
i
would
say,
however,
your
honor--
mr.
wayne
jett
--well,
your
honor,
under
that
determination
it
treats
the
plan
as
a
defined
benefit
plan.
in
other
words,
in
the
1980
amendment
it
made
clear
that
congress
intended
these
kinds
of
plans
to
be
treated
as
a
"defined
benefit
plan"
under
this
statute.
mr.
wayne
jett
it
would
have
been
zero,
because
a
defined
contribution
plan
would
not
be
covered
by
this
statute.
a
defined
contribution
plan
prior
to
the
statute
was
one
in
which
the
employer
promised
to
pay
a
fixed
or
defined
contribution.
the
statute,
the
lower
court
held
before
the
1980
amendment,
had
changed
that
in
a
technical
way
to
in
effect
mean
that
an
individual
account
plan,
a
defined
contribution
plan,
is
no
longer
judged
on
that
criterion.
now,
the
point
i
would
make
about
the
'74
statute,
as
i
would
make
about
the
'80
amendment,
is
that
from
the
date
of
enactment
of
that
statute
there
was
a
taking
of
property
from
the
employer
based
on
two
events
that
were
not
subject
to
the
control
of
the
employer.
the
first
event
was
the
termination
of
the
plan,
and
under
the
statute,
sections
4041
and
4042,
there
are
two
ways
basically
in
which
the
plan
can
be
terminated.
it
can
be
terminated
voluntarily
by
the
trustees
administering
the
plan
or
it
can
be
forceably
terminated
by
the
pbgc
through
certain
procedures.
that
certainly
is
not
subject
to
control
by
the
individual
employer.
the
second
event
is,
after
the
termination
the
pbgc
under
the
'74
statute
had
the
discretion
to
guarantee
the
benefits,
and
if
it
did
and
if
there
was
any
need
for
additional
funds
they
would
assess
the
employer
and
he
had
to
pay
it
at
that
time.
so
both
of
those
events
were
completely
outside
of
the
control
of
the
employer
to
effect
whether
or
not
his
property
would
be
taken.
we
come
then
to
the
1980
circumstance,
and
we
have
still
a
statute,
as
this
court
determined
in
the
r.a.
gray
case,
that
congress
did
not
permit
an
opportunity
for
the
employer
to
decide
whether
he
would
or
would
not
continue
in
the
pension
plan
under
this
new
circumstance
in
which
the
statute
imposes
the
liability.
under
that
circumstance,
there
was
never
a
hiatus
period
allowing
the
employer
to
withdraw
from
the
plan
before
this
new
liability
came
into
effect.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
p.a.
gray
said,
they
wanted
to
make
sure
he
didn't
have
that
opportunity.
so
we
cannot
have
under
the
statute
at
any
time
since
the
enactment
date
in
'74
any
point
at
which
there
is
a
consensual
opportunity
for
the
employer
to
agree
to
the
taking
of
his
property.
mr.
wayne
jett
that,
your
honor,
you
see,
is
a
statute,
as
we
have
cited
in
our
brief,
the
darlington
case,
in
which
it
takes
effect
from
that
day
forward
and
you
go
forward.
if
you
do
not
wish
to
engage
in
the
activity,
then
you
just
don't
engage
in
it.
but
if
you
do
engage
in
it
from
that
day
forward,
including
any
executory
contracts,
they
must
be
subject
to
that
and
you
must
pay
on
a
continuing
basis.
mr.
wayne
jett
there
can
be...
well,
i
would
have
to
say
this.
the
tax
statutes,
the
tax
cases,
i
believe
are
of
a
different
nature--
mr.
wayne
jett
--than
the
taking
clause,
because
they
fall
under
the
article
i,
section
8
power
of
taxation.
mr.
wayne
jett
your
honor,
we
have
dealt
with
the
taxing
cases
in
our
reply
brief.
the
point
was
made
in
the
answering
brief
that
if
we
have
to
pay
compensation
for
this,
this
taking,
the
government
could
not
possibly
afford
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
government
could
not
even
go
on,
because
it
would
have
not
even
the
power
of
taxation.
we
have
pointed
out
there
that
this
court
in
its
opinions
looks
at
the
taxing
cases
under
article
i,
section
8,
as
in
effect
a
concurrent
power
and
interprets
that
power
to
tax
as
being
consistent
with
the
taking
protection
in
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
wayne
jett
it
is
the
money,
your
honor.
mr.
wayne
jett
it
is
the
property.
mr.
wayne
jett
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
wayne
jett
no,
your
honor,
i'm
not.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i'm
saying
that
the
statute
by
its
effect
transfers
money
out
of
the
pocket
of
the
employer
into
the
pension
trust.
mr.
wayne
jett
that
is
correct.
it
is
a
giving...
it
is
a
taking
of
property
from
one
private
party
and
giving
it
to
another
by
government
act,
and
without
compensation.
mr.
wayne
jett
i
believe
that
would
be
the
effect--
mr.
wayne
jett
--of
the
brooks-scanlan
type
of
decisions.
mr.
wayne
jett
that
is
correct.
mr.
wayne
jett
and
this
statute
goes
even
further
than
that.
in
effect,
it
doesn't
say
you
can
get
out
if
you're
willing
to
pay
this
amount.
it
says
you
can
get
out
and
pay
this
amount
or
agree
to
terms
of
economic
cost
to
you
set
by
the
union,
because
the
statute
does
not
say
that
it's
only
an
agreement
on
the
contributions--
the
union
can
say,
we're
not
signing
an
hour
wage
increase,
or
various
other
provisions,
and
agreement.
so
all
of
those
terms
of
business
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement--
mr.
wayne
jett
--in
order
to
have
an
agreement
requiring
contributions
to
the
trust
you
do,
your--
mr.
wayne
jett
--correct.
mr.
wayne
jett
correct.
there
is
a
withdrawal
from
the
plan
and
a
withdrawal
liability.
mr.
wayne
jett
that
is
correct.
under
the
section,
the
amounts
that
are
charged
according
to
the
statute.
now,
we
believe
that
the
concessions
made
by
pbgc
here
basically--
mr.
wayne
jett
--if
the
employer--
mr.
wayne
jett
--not
necessarily,
your
honor.
there's
completely
different
provisions
and
it
simply
leaves
the
contributions
into
the
plan
as
the
only
operative
of
the
statute,
but
that
agreement
is
a
part
of
an
entire
collective
bargaining
enterprise
that
covers
all
wages
and
conditions
of
employment.
mr.
wayne
jett
no,
your
honor,
you
would
not.
mr.
wayne
jett
under
the
statute,
it
means
then
that
the
employer
must
pay
the
withdrawal
liability.
the
taking
of
property
occurs
because
of
that.
mr.
wayne
jett
that
is
either
in
a
lump
sum
or
in
monthly
payments
according
to
the
statute.
mr.
wayne
jett
right.
and
all
of
that
is
a
taking
of
property
in
the
sense
that
there
was
no
obligation
except
for
the
statute
that
this
money
must
be
paid.
mr.
wayne
jett
your
honor,
it
would
not
be
a
taking
if
you
are
measuring
the
contribution
by
events
after
the
date
of
the
statute,
by
the
employment
after
the
statute.
if
it
were
a
requirement
that
you
must
pay
money--
mr.
wayne
jett
--that
is
correct.
it
would
be
a
taking
of
property.
basically
what
congress
has
done
is
said,
they've
looked
at
a
problem
they've
regarded
as
intractable
and
said:
we
would
like
to
deal
with
this
in
a
way
that
is
more
tractable
if
we
can
take
some
money
from
here
and
increase
the
property
owned
by
this
other
party.
and
that
is
the
essential
thing
that
the
taking
clause
says
cannot
be
done.
you
cannot
take
property
without
compensation
by
statute.
mr.
wayne
jett
your
honor,
it
does
not
state
in
this
record
as
far
as
woodward
sand
is
concerned.
mr.
wayne
jett
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
mr.
wayne
jett
it
in
effect
states
that
any
taking
of
property
to
any
degree
is
a
complete
taking
of
the
property.
that
is,
that
the
property
ownership
must
be
given
up
entirely.
and
when
that
occurs,
the
taking
clause
must
be
satisfied.
mr.
wayne
jett
it
does
not,
your
honor.
mr.
wayne
jett
it
does
not.
i
will
reserve
what
i
have
for
rebuttal.
mr.
wayne
jett
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
say
first,
turner
elkhorn
and
r.a.
gray
both
were
cases
that
answered
only
due
process
issues.
they
did
not
involve
the
taking
clause.
the
only
thing
they
have
to
say
about
a
taking
clause
issue
is
that
there
was
a
deprivation
of
property
there.
now,
in
terms
of
whether
there's
a
different
type
of
property
for
due
process
and
the
taking
clause,
they
appear
in
the
same
fifth
amendment
and
they
don't
change
the
type
of
property.
there
is
no
state,
and
that
would
decide
that
money
certainly
not
this
court,
that
money
is
not
property.
and
in
fact,
the
taking
clause
in
its
very
essence
was
intended
as
a
prohibition
against
government
action
taking
wealth
from
one
minority
party
and
transferring
it
to
someone
favored
by
the
majority.
it
was
intended
first
and
foremost
as
a
protection
of
minority
rights
against
oppression
by
the
majority.
and
if
we
look
to
any
of
the
issues
that
have
been
raised
by
ppgc...
rationality,
ameliorating
provisions,
whether
the
statute
is
precisely
suited
to
the
regulatory
purpose,
whether
it's
fair...
every
one
of
those
arguments
has
no
protection
for
minority
rights.
they
are
all
decided
in
the
view
of
the
majority.
mr.
wayne
jett
certainly,
your
honor.
the
statute
that
he
cited
involves
only
the
situation
in
which
there
is
a
short
interim
hiatus
during
bargaining.
if
there
is
no
final
agreement
reached,
the
withdrawal
liability
applies.
it
only
says
you
don't
go
out
and
collect
the
withdrawal
liability
while
the
union's
on
strike.
mr.
wayne
jett
no
question
about
it.
in
my
opinion
it
is
absolutely
clear
and
it
says
so
in
so
many
words.
mr.
wayne
jett
all
you
have
to
do
is
leave.
if
there's
no
withdrawal
liability,
then
there's
no
taking
of
property.
but
certainly
that's
exactly
what
the
statute
says
you
can't
do.
mr.
wayne
jett
your
honor,
it
still
is
a
taking
of
property.
mr.
wayne
jett
it
is
a
taking
by
the
statute
that
would
not
exist
otherwise.
money
is
property.
they
have
not
made
any
argument
against
our
citations
of
this
court's
authority.
household
finance
versus
sniadach
holds
that
money
is
property.
webb's
fabulous
pharmacies
says
that
if
you
took
interest
on
this
money
and
it's
property,
then
it's
a
violation
of
the
taking
clause.
mr.
wayne
jett
that
is
not
true,
your
honor.
there
is
certainly
a
claim
and
in
fact
an
arbitration
award
against
woodward
sand
to
the
effect
that
it
is--
mr.
wayne
jett
--no,
your
honor.
there
were
three
other
intervenors
in
the
case.
those
did
fall
prior
to
the
time
that
the
statute
was
later
amended
after
gray
and
cut
off
their
liability.
those
dropped
out.
woodward
still
has
a
liability.
and
in
any
case--
