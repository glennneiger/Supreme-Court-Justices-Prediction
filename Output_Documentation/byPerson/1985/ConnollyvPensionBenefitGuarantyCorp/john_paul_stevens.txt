justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
a
question,
mr.
jett.
supposing
congress
passed
a
statute
and
said
that
every
employer
who
has
more
than
200
employees,
whatever
it
might
be,
must
contribute
to
a
pension
plan,
whether
he's
done
so
voluntarily
or
not,
at
least
$100,000
a
year,
say.
would
that
be
a
taking,
whether
you've
already
signed
up
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
it
was
based
on
last
year's
business,
you'd
say
it
would
be
a
taking?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
be
your
view,
just
to
get
it
thought
through,
that
there
could
never
be
a
valid
statute
imposing
withdrawal
liability
on
an
employer
unless
there
was
sufficient
advance
notice
to
let
him
out
of
the
pension
fund
cost-free?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
apart
from
the
advanced
notice,
you'd
say,
and
no
matter
how
small
the
obligation?
i'm
trying
to...
i'm
not
clear,
in
other
words,
whether
your
argument
turns
in
part
on
the
fact
that
$200,000
is
a
lot
of
money
for
your
client.
it
would
be
the
same
case
if
it
was
20
cents
and
your
contribution
level
was
a
million
dollars?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
if
the
record
shows
what
your
rate
of
contributions
are?
your
withdrawal
liability
as
i
understand
is
about
$200,000.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
much
would
that
be
per
year,
roughly?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
question.
justice
o'connor
raised
the
question
about
the
standing
of
the
trustee
to
litigate
on
behalf
of
the
employers.
what's
your
view
on
that,
that
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
fellner,
i
have
to
confess
i
have
one
very
difficult
problem
on
this
case.
this
is
a
facial
challenge
and
not
an
as
applied
challenge,
so
we
really
don't
have
to
know
whether
as
applied
to
any
litigant
before
the
court
there's
really
a
problem.
is
there
standing
in
such
a
case?
are
there
facial
challenges
on
the
taking
clause?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
we
didn't
decide
the
merits.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
your
opponent
made
that
argument.
he
said
even
if
they
only
take
ten
dollars
without
advance
notice--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that's
their
whole
argument.
