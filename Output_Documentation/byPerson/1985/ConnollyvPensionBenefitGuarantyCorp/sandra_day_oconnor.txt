justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
jett,
may
i
inquire
just
a
moment.
now,
you're
trustees
of
the
operating
engineers
pension
trust,
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
not
the
employers?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
challenged
below
the
determination
that
the
plan
was
a
defined
benefit
plan?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
lost.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay,
and
that
issue
has
been
resolved
against
you
and
it's
not
part
of
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
what's
your
interest
as
trustee
in
arguing
the
imposition
of
the
withdrawal
liability
on
the
employers?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
whose
rights?
the
employers?
i
just
don't
see
why
the
trustees
would
care
one
way
or
another.
you
just
want
to
know
what
has
to
come
in
for
you
to
administer,
and
i
don't
see
why
you
care
what
the
rule
is.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
in
this
case
has
the
liability
of
the
employers
been
determined?
and
if
so,
how
much
have
they
been
asked
to
pay?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
wasn't
clear
to
me
at
all
from
reading
the
briefs
whether
we're
just
looking
at
this
on
the
basis
that
there
will
be
some
liability
imposed,
but
we
don't
know
how
much,
or
whether
something
has
already
been
determined.
have
the
trustees
assessed
a
specific
amount
against
the
employers
in
this
particular
plan
and
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
mind
going
back
to
my
question,
then,
and
telling
me
how
much
has
been
determined
that
the
employer
here
would
have
to
pay?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
has
there
been
judicial
review
of
that
amount
yet?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
does
that
differ
in
total
amount
from
what
would
have
been
determined
had
it
been
a
defined
contribution
plan,
a
defined
benefit
plan?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
i
misspoke.
had
it
been
a
defined
contribution
plan,
what
would
the
amount
have
been?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
do
you
say
is
taken
here?
is
it
the
contractual
right
to
be
free
from
additional
liability
under
the
plan,
or
is
it
the
money
that
eventually
has
to
be
paid?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
is
the
money.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
the
property,
the
money
that
eventually
has
to
be
paid?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
jett,
as
i
understand
it
the
act
provides
for
alternative
methods
of
calculating
withdrawal
liability.
does
the
record
tell
us
which
method
was
used
here?
was
it
the
presumptive
method
used
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
your
attack
on
the
act
does
not
include
a
challenge
to
a
particular
method--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--of
calculating
withdrawal
liability?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
your
attack
does
not
include
an
attack
on
the
procedures
set
up
under
the
act?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
for
review.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
freeman,
may
i
ask
you
the
same
question
i
asked
mr.
jett.
do
you
claim
the
property
taken
is
the
contractual
right
to
be
free
from
additional
liability?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
the
money
you
have
to
pay?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
to
clarify
what
you've
just
said
a
moment
ago,
there
is
to
be
no
appeal
from
the
arbitration
award
of
the
calculation
of
liability.
so
as
far
as
your
clients
are
concerned,
that's
now
fixed
and
we
know
what
the
liability
is?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
were
the
ones
here
involuntary?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
in
looking
at
the
taking
clause
cases
in
determining
the
issue
that
you
raise,
is
it...
do
we
normally
look
at
whether
there
is
some
valid
reason
why
congress
has
imposed
this
liability
on
employers
generally,
rather
than
on
the
public
at
large?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no?
that
doesn't
enter
into
the
determination
of
whether
it's
a
taking?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
is
that
part
and
parcel
of
the
inquiry
that's
made
to
determine
the
takings
issue
routinely?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
the
worry
here
is
the
fact
that
the
plan
may
have
been
one
which
is
sponsored
and
effectively
controlled
by
the
union,
not
the
employer,
and
the
employer
may
have
been
induced
to
join
it
be
representations
by
the
union
that
their
liability
would
be
limited
in
accordance
with
the
terms
of
the
plan,
and
in
fact
their
withdrawal
may
be
automatically
imposed
without
the
fault
of
the
employer,
and
yet
here
is
this
vast
potential
liability.
those
are
the
hard
facts
that
certainly
cause
one
to
be
concerned.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there
is
certainly
evidence
of
an
expectation
that
the
liability
would
be
limited.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
those
are
statutes
where
the
employer
can
say:
well,
given
the
change
in
the
law,
i'm
not
going
to
stay
in
business,
i'll
get
out
of
business,
i
won't
have
any
employees
and
i
won't
have
any
liability.
that
choice
isn't
open
to
these
employers.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
because
the
liability
will
be
imposed
regardless
of
whether
they
terminate
their
business.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
for
your
revelation
in
argument
about
the
fact
that
there
may
be
no
liability
in
this
case--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--i
suppose
it
is
an
as
applied
challenge.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
for
your
allegation
that
there
will
in
fact
be
no
liability
here
on
the
employers,
it
would
have
been
an
as
applied
challenge,
because
the
amount
of
withdrawal
liability
had
been
determined.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
jett,
is
it
true
that
the
trustees
have
agreed
that
none
of
these
employers
will
be
liable
for
anything
on
withdrawal
liability
because
the
withdrawal
was
before
the
effective
date
of
the
act?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
trustees
have
not
conceded
that
there
would
be
no
liability?
