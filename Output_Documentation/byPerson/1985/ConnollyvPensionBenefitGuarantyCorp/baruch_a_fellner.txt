mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
will
make
two
arguments
this
afternoon:
first,
that
the
taking
clause
simply
does
not
apply
to
the
multiemployer
act;
and
secondly,
that
even
if
this
statute
does
implicate
the
taking
clause,
that
it
meets
any
and
all
of
the
tests
articulated
by
this
court
in
resolving
taking
clause
questions.
now,
our
threshold
position
is
that
the
taking
clause
has
never
been
thought
to
apply
to
socioeconomic
legislation
which
simply
imposes
a
liability
on
one
party
to
compensate
another
party
for
the
harm
or
potential
harm
that
he
causes.
this
court
decided
in
pension
benefit
guaranty
corporation
versus
r.a.
gray
in
1984
that
the
multiemployer
act...
and
i
quote
from
the
court's
opinion...
"merely
requires
a
withdrawing
employer
to
compensate
a
pension
plan
for
benefits
that
have
already
vested
with
the
employees
at
the
time
of
the
employer's
withdrawal.
"
using
the
words
of
the
fifth
amendment,
private
property
is
simply
not
being
taken
for
the
public
use
without
just
compensation.
when
the
congress
requires
withdrawing
employers
to
pay
for
the
consequences
of
their
own
conduct,
no
taking
clause
violation
is
implicated.
now,
this
is
precisely
the
kind
of
compensatory
statute
to
which
the
taking
clause
should
not
be
applied.
mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
the
conduct
of
the
employer,
mr.
chief
justice,
involved
here
is
an
inchoate
business
decision.
the
employer,
subsequent
to
the
enactment
of
this
statute,
must
decide
as
to
whether
it's
in
his
best
economic
interest
to
continue
contributing
to
the
plan,
to
bargain
to
impasse,
given
all
of
the
other
issues
that
are
present
insofar
as
collective
bargaining
is
concerned,
or
to
withdraw
from
the
plan.
and
under
those
circumstances,
to
suggest
that
we
have
specific
identifiable
property,
as
justice
o'connor's
questions
were
going
to
that
particular
point,
in
this
case
is
illusory.
we
have,
to
return
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
simply
an
inchoate
business
decision,
and
that
does
not
implicate
property
insofar
as
the
taking
clause
is
concerned.
mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
those
are
the
hard
facts
that
are
not
before
the
court.
there
are
no
such
facts
that
are
present
in
the
case
at
bar
to
indicate
that
any
such
inducement
occurred.
quite
the
contrary,
in
this
particular
case
we
have
a
trust
in
which
there
are
equal
numbers
of
employer
and
employee
representatives.
there
is
no
suggestion
in
this
record
that
this
trust
was
dominated
by
union
interests,
that
in
any
way,
shape,
or
form
they
caused
the
withdrawal
here
and
therefore
triggered
the
liability.
mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
that
expectation
flowed
from
contract.
mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
and
i
daresay,
justice
o'connor
that
similar
expectations
were
prevalent
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
which
allowed
employees
to
be
fired
at
will.
and
similarly,
one
could
go
down
a
litany
of
statutes.
the
civil
rights
act
changed
the
expectations
of
employers
that
they
relied
upon
interims
of
their
contracts.
mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
this
statute,
your
honor,
has
a
post-enactment
date,
and
insofar
as
the
retroactive
effect
was
concerned,
while
there
was
a
contract
that
limited
the
liability
of
the
employers
in
this
case,
justice
rehnquist,
it
is
quite
clear
in
norman
versus
baltimore,
in
the
motley
case,
and
in
the
gray
case,
that
one
cannot
insulate
oneself
from
requirements
simply
by
making
a
contract
out
of
them.
now,
i
would
submit
that
the
statute
at
issue
here,
precisely
as
justice
rehnquist
pointed
out,
is
very
much
like
the
social
security
statute.
it
is
like
the
black
lung
statute
which
was
at
issue
in
usery
elkhorn.
and
these
are
statutes
which
adjust
the
burdens
and
benefits
of
economic
life,
and
such
socioeconomic
legislation
should
be
tested
only
by
its
rationality
under
the
due
process
clause,
a
test
which
appellants--
mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
--oh,
yes
it
is
open
to
these
employers.
mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
i
understand
your
question,
justice
o'connor.
that
is
correct,
the
liability
will
be
imposed
regardless
of
whether
they
terminate
their
business.
however,
i
would
point
out
an
ameliorative
provision
which
tempers
that
liability.
it
is
section
4225
of
the
statute,
which,
when
an
employer
liquidates
his
business,
there
is
a
sliding
scale
which
allows
the
withdrawal
liability
to
be
reduced
to
a
tremendous
degree
under
that
particular
provision.
but
assuming
for
the
moment
that
section
4225
does
not
alleviate
the
problem
in
its
entirety,
we
return
to
the
basic
notion,
and
that
is
these
are
liabilities,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
pbgc
versus
r.a.
gray
case,
these
are
liabilities
that
the
withdrawing
employer
leaves
behind.
and
those
liabilities,
regardless
of
whether
his
withdrawal
from
the
plan
is
voluntary
or
involuntary,
those
are
liabilities
which
in
the
first
instance
under
the
taking
clause
should
be
tested
be
a
justice
and
fairness
standard.
moving
to
the
applicability
of
the
takings
clause,
it
seems
to
me
that
under
notions--
mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
--sounds
to
me
like
it's
the
black
lung
statute,
which
this
court
sustained
in
its
retroactive
impact
on
turner
elkhorn.
that
is
precisely
the
kind
of
statute
where
the
employer,
the
current
employer,
was
required
to
pay
for
the
ills
retroactively
created
in
the
past.
and
i
might
add,
your
honor,
that
insofar
the
turner
elkhorn
statute
was
concerned,
it
was
the
last
employer
in
time.
i.e.,
an
employee
could
have
worked
for
an
employer
for
30
years
and
been
exposed
to
coal
dust
in
the
mines,
and
for
his
last
year
worked
for
a
different
employer.
it
is
that
different
employer
for
whom
he
worked
for
one
year
who
must
pay
the
entire
liability
of
black
lung.
it
seems
to
me
the
retroactive
effect
in
that
case
is
even
greater
than
in
the
case
at
bar,
and
it
was
sustained
in
the
turner
elkhorn
case.
now,
if
we
may
move
to
the
standard
set
for--
mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
--mr.
chief
justice,
let
me
suggest
that
there
are
numerous
ways
in
which
withdrawal
liability
can
be
avoided
by
the
seller.
for
example,
if
there
is
a
simple
sale
of
stock,
no
withdrawal
liability
is
triggered.
if
there
is
a
sale
of
assets
and
certain
bonds
are
taken
out
by
both
the
purchasing
and
selling
employer,
and
the
purchasing
employer
remains
responsible
for
the
same
contribution
base
units
that
the
selling
employer
was
responsible
for,
under
those
circumstances
no
withdrawal
liability
is
triggered.
and
consequently,
in
order
to
judge
this
statute
in
terms
of
its
entirety...
and
that's
why
rationality
should
be
the
touchstone
of
judging
a
statute
from
stem
to
stern...
it
seems
to
me
that
under
those
circumstances
the
court
should
take
into
consideration
all
of
the
ameliorative
provisions
in
this
statute
before
it
can
strike
it
down.
now,
assuming
arguendo
that,
as
appellants
claim,
the
taking
clause
does
apply
in
this
case,
we
submit
that
basic
notions
of
justice,
of
fairness,
have
informed
this
court's
analysis,
and
under
those
notions
the
multiemployer
act
is
clearly
constitutional.
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out
in
her
colloquy
with
mr.
freeman,
the
predominant
question
under
the
taking
clause
is
whether
withdrawing
employers
have
been
arbitrarily
singled
out
to
share
the
costs...
and
i
emphasize,
share
the
costs,
because
as
one
court
put
it,
the
pain
is
indeed
spread
around
among
participants
and
among
withdrawing
employers,
as
well
as
those
that
pay
premiums,
and
remaining
employers,
those
who
continue
to
contribute
to
the
plan.
the
question
is
whether
withdrawing
employers
have
been
singled
out
to
share
those
costs
of
maintaining
pension
plan
stability,
and
i
return
to
this
court's
opinion
in
the
r.a.
gray
case.
mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
well,
we
recognize,
of
course,
that
the
standing
issue
is
certainly
the
primary
difficulty
of
the
appellants
rather
than
the
appellees
in
this
particular
case.
however,
on
balance
we
feel
that
the
trustees
do
have
standing
in
this
case.
the
trustees
have
alleged...
we
believe
their
allegations
do
not
rise
to
the
level
of
constitutional
significance,
but
they
have
alleged
that
certain
kinds
of
harm
which
they
feel
are
triggered
by
withdrawal
liability
endanger
or
may
endanger
new
employers
from
joining
the
plan.
they
may
endanger
ultimate
pension
plan
viability.
now,
that
allegation
is
contrary
to
the
findings
of
congress
in
this
case.
however,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
basis
allegation
is
probably
sufficient,
and
i
point
the
court
to
a
footnote
in
andrus
versus
allard.
it's
footnote
21,
in
which
the
court
faced
a
similar,
not
on
all
fours,
but
a
similar
kind
of
standing
difficulty,
and
overcame
i
believe
that
particular
standing
difficulty.
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
sufficient.
we
do,
however,
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
initial
questioning,
we
do
however
insist
that
woodward
sand
has
no
standing.
and
contrary
to
the
representations
made
by
woodward
sand
in
this
particular
case,
they
have
very
deftly
preserved
the
argument
that
they
owe
no
withdrawal
liability.
and
they
have
suggested
in
their
briefs
that
they
may
have
withdrawn
prior
to
the
enactment
date
of
this
statute.
if
that
allegation
is
so,
they
owe
nothing.
similarly,
the
allegations
of
a
million
dollars
insofar
as
the
totality
of
liability
owed
by
all
the
four
withdrawing
employers
who
began
this
case,
that
allegation
must
be
taken
with
a
salt
shaker,
because
in
point
of
fact
the
trustees
have
told
the
other
three
employers
in
this
case
that
they
owe
nothing
because
they
withdrew
prior
to
the
enactment
date.
under
these
circumstances,
we
really
do
not
have
before
the
court,
it
seems
to
me,
a
viable
withdrawing
employer
challenging
this
statute.
standing,
however,
is
preserved
to
proceed
in
this
case
insofar
as
the
trustees
are
concerned.
returning
to
the
taking
clause
question,
let
me
remind
the
court
what
it
said
in
pbgc
versus
gray,
and
there
the
court
concluded
that
if
withdrawal
liability
were
not
exacted
from
withdrawing
employers,
those
employers
that
remain
in
the
plan
would
have
to
increase
their
contributions
to
cover
the
liabilities
that
withdrawing
employers,
be
they
voluntary
or
involuntary,
justice
o'connor,
those
remaining
employers
would
have
to
increase
their
contributions
in
order
to
cover
the
liabilities
that
withdrawing
employers
leave
behind.
the
court
also
concluded
in
pbgc
versus
gray
that
withdrawals
could
ultimately
affect
plan
stability.
accordingly,
the
costs
which
congress
linked
to
employer
withdrawals
should
be
borne,
not
by
the
public
as
a
whole,
nor
by
remaining
employers,
but
indeed
we
suggest
by
those
that
withdraw.
withdrawing
employers
are
not
like
the
homeowner
who
happens
to
be
in
the
path
accidentally
of
the
public's
highway.
typically,
takings
involve
the
transfer
of
property
between
unrelated
parties
or
between
a
private
party
and
the
government
acting
in
its
entrepreneurial
capacity.
here,
on
the
other
hand,
congress
concluded
that
employers
who
withdraw
from
multiemployer
plans
should
continue
their
pension
funding
obligations.
they,
after
all,
have
received
the
benefit
of
their
bargain.
they,
after
all,
have
received
the
benefit
of
their
employees'
labor,
as
well
as
the
benefits
of
reduced
wages
in
return
for
deferred
compensation.
mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
insofar
as
the
contract
is
concerned,
you're
absolutely
right.
insofar
as,
justice
rehnquist,
the
overall
responsibility
for
funding
these
pension
benefits
and
the
liabilities
that
they
create,
indeed
they
have
received
the
benefit,
the
entire
benefit.
mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
that
is
correct.
now,
this
kind
of
a
compensatory
statute
clearly
meets
this
court's
often
articulated
justice
and
fairness
rule
under
the
takings
clause.
in
andrus
versus
allard,
for
example,
the
court
said:
"suffice
it
to
say
that
government
regulation
by
definition
involves
the
adjustment
of
rights
for
the
public
good.
"
"often
this
adjustment
curtails
some
potential
use
or
economic
exploitation
of
private
property.
"
"to
require
compensation
in
all
such
circumstances
would
effectively
compel
the
government
to
regulate
by
purchase.
"
it
seems
to
me
that
that
language
in
that
case
applies
with
special
force
to
the
case
at
bar.
as
part
of
this
court's
consideration
of
justice
and
fairness,
it
has
further
articulated
three
factors.
they
are
the
character
of
the
government's
action,
the
economic
impact
of
regulation,
and
the
interference
with
reasonable
investment-backed
expectations.
those
three
factors
appear
to
infuse
this
court's
notions
of
justice
and
fairness.
first,
the
character
of
the
government's
action
in
this
case
does
not
amount
to
a
governmental
appropriation
or
a
physical
occupation,
as
in
loretto
versus
teleprompter
or
as
in
penn
central
versus
city
of
new
york,
where
the
court
observed
that
a
taking
is
more
readily
found
when
the
government
physically
invades
than
when
interference
arises
from
a
public
program
adjusting
the
benefits
and
burdens
of
economic
life.
mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
it
seems
to
me
that,
once
again,
that
kind
of
a
question
touches
on
rationality.
if
congress
were--
mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
--if
the
court
is
posing
it
in
the
context
of
the
taking
clause,
and
if
the
court
is
suggesting
that
there
is
no
relationship
between
the
withdrawing
employer
and
the
ex-pension
fund
that
he
is
required
by
congress,
required
by
congress
to
contribute
to,
whether
or
not
that
constitutes
a
taking,
i
would
suggest,
your
honor,
that
perhaps
even
that
does
not
constitute
a
taking
because,
because
the
court
has
never
held
that
the
kind
of
"property"
which
allegedly
is
at
stake
here,
namely
money
or
an
inchoate
business
decision...
the
court
has
never
held,
it
seems
to
me,
that
that
kind
of
property
constitutes
property
cognizable
under
the
taking
clause,
even--
mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
--even
though
it
may
be
property
not
taken,
that's
correct.
as
this
court
has
pointed
out,
judgment
as
much
as
logic
sometimes
infuses
the
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
a
taking
occurs.
and
while
logically,
justice
white,
your
question
definitely
leads
me
down
the
road
of
concluding
that
it
constitutes
taking,
in
terms
of
the
basic
judgment
involved
that
may
violate
due
process.
it
may
be
property
for
purposes
of
due
process
in
terms
of
an
irrational
act
by
congress,
if
we
want
to
create
that
hypothetical.
but
whether
it
constitutes
the
specific
identifiable
property
cognizable
under
the
taking
clause,
i
would
submit
that
it
does
not.
mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
let
me
first
of
all
suggest
that
under
section
4218
of
the
statute
any
withdrawal
that
is
triggered
by
a
strike
does
not
trigger
withdrawal
liability.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
the
short
answer
to
that
particular
question.
congress
recognized
in
this
statute
that
there
were
extremes
of
manipulation
which
could
create
a
withdrawal
liability
that
they
did
not
want
to
do,
and
under
4218
that
particular
hypothetical
does
not
occur.
mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
that
is
correct.
the
second
factor
involved
in
a
fairness
or
taking
clause
violation
is
whether
or
not
the
impact
of
the
regulation
is
so
great
as
to,
if
i
can
borrow
the
term,
shock
the
conscience
of
the
court.
that
economic
impact
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
me,
cannot
be
judged.
we
have
before
the
court
a
facial
challenge.
we
do
not
have
an
as-applied
challenge
in
this
case.
even
appellant
woodward
sand,
as
we've
indicated
earlier,
may
owe
nothing.
given
the
complex--
mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
--we
have
indicated
in
our
brief.
mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
i'm
sorry,
justice
o'connor?
mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
the
court
below
concluded
that
this
was
a
facial
challenge.
the
court
below
precluded
the
pension
benefit
guaranty
corporation
from
conducting
discovery
in
order
to
put
the
facts
alleged
by
the
four
employers
below
into
a
broader
context,
for
example
that
net
worth
is
net
the
appropriate
measure
of
impact
upon
a
specific
employer.
the
court
below
precluded
us
from
developing
this
evidence
precisely
because
it
presented
and
it
concluded
that
this
case
was
a
facial
challenge,
and
the
simple
presence
of
money,
of
$201,000
as
an
assessment,
does
not
constitute
sufficient
evidence
to
transform
this
case
from
a
facial
to
an
as-applied
challenge.
and
this
court
is
faced
with,
and
the
concession
is
by
the
parties
below
as
well
as
the
conclusion
is
by
the
court
below,
that
we
have
only
here
before
us
a
facial
challenge
and
not
an
as-applied
challenge,
which
has
gone
completely
through
all
of
the
complex
procedures
in
this
particular
statute.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
any
kind
of
measurement
of
economic
impact
on
a
specific
employer,
because
if
we
only
have
$201,000
that
doesn't
tell
us
in
terms
of
the
takings
clause
cases
that
this
court
has
decided,
that
doesn't
tell
us
the
influence
or
the
impact
of
this
particular
alleged
taking
on
this
specific
employer.
third,
we
submit
that
withdrawal
liability
does
not
interfere
with
reasonable
investment-backed
expectations
in
this
case.
the
trustees--
mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
--yes,
there
are.
interestingly
enough,
in
agins
versus
tiburon,
i
believe
that
that
was
presented
to
this
court
as
a
facial
taking
challenge.
mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
yes,
i
believe
the
merits
were
decided
in
that
particular
case.
now,
i
know
this
court
in
williamson
county
struggled
with
precisely
that
question,
as
to
whether
there
was
a
sufficient
amount
of
facts
in
that
case--
mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
--in
which
case,
agins
versus
tiburon?
i'm
not
sure,
justice
white.
i
believe
it
was
presented
as
a
facial
challenge
and
i
believe
this
court
concluded
that
as
a
facial
challenge
it
did
not
constitute
a
taking.
mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
it
is
conceivable
that
a
taking
challenge...
in
response
to
both
of
your
questions,
it
is
conceivable
that
a
taking
challenge,
when
viewed
in
the
context
of
an
entire
statute,
i.e.
this
court
could
conclude
that
there
is
sufficient
standing
if
one
dollar
is
taken.
if
the
court
concludes
that
money
is
property,
if
the
court
concludes,
notwithstanding
our
arguments,
that
it
is
unfair
to
take
one
dollar
from
any
withdrawing
employer,
then
under
those
circumstances
it
is
entirely
conceivable
that
the
court
could
determine
that
a
facial
taking
challenge
is
valid.
mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
that's
correct.
mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
that's
correct.
but
under
the
second
prong
of
this
court's
analysis
namely
the
degree
of
economic
impact,
that
particular
prong
is
inapplicable
to
such
a
facial
challenge.
but
the
court
could
consider
the
question
in
terms
of
basic
justice
and
fairness
and
in
terms
of
the
other
prongs
to
that
particular
analysis.
the
third
one,
degree
of
investment-backed
expectations,
and
we
submit
that
the
trustees
had
no
investment-backed
expectations
in
terms
of
seeing
to
it
that
withdrawal
liability
is
not
exacted.
their
interests
are
to
the
contrary.
and
once
again,
insofar
as
withdrawing
employers
are
concerned,
they
did
so
with
their
eyes
open.
they
must
have
understood
what
the
impact
would
be
on
their
business.
employer
expectations
have
been
tempered
by
six
years
of
<erisa>
[=
erisa],
contingent
withdrawal
liability,
extensive
congressional
debate.
and
as
this
court
found
in
gray,
even
with
respect
to
employers
that
withdrew
prior
to
the
enactment
date,
we
believe,
said
the
court,
employers
had
ample
notice
of
withdrawal
liability
imposed
by
nepa.
finally,
it
would
be
anomalous,
i
would
suggest,
indeed
for
this
court,
having
sustained
the
retroactive
imposition
of
withdrawal
liability
under
the
due
process
clause,
to
strike
down
its
prospective
application
under
the
taking
clause.
if
the
taking
clause
becomes
a
vehicle
to
set
aside
this
regulatory
scheme
to
ensure
stability
in
pension
plans,
if
the
payment
of
money
to
defray
the
costs
of
one's
own
obligations
is
classified
as
a
compensable
taking,
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
the
ghost
of
lochner
may
indeed
walk
again.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
we
ask
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below
be
affirmed.
