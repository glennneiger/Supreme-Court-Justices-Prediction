mr.
richard
m.
freeman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
stand
here
before
you
representing
the
employer,
woodward
sand,
in
his
case,
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court,
which
is
pointed
out
in
the
footnotes
to
our
brief,
that
at
the
beginning
of
this
proceeding
i
represented
three
other
additional
employers
and
the
total
liability
assessed
against
them
by
this
pension
fund
approached
a
million
dollars.
it
is
correct
that
mr.
jett
stated
the
liability
that
has
now
finally
been
determined
by
woodward
sand
under
the
arbitration
procedure
is
$201,000,
and
the
period
of
30
days
which
the
trust
fund
could
have
had
to
review
that
number
has
now
passed
and
there
was
no
review
being
sought.
so
that
is
a
right
number
in
so
many
words.
i
would
like
to
emphasize
to
the
court
that
in
this
case
there
are
three
parties
to
the
scenario,
not
two,
as
the
government's
brief
would
have
you
believe.
there
is
the
pension
fund,
there
is
the
union,
and
there
is
the
employer.
in
cases
where
property
is
completely
expropriated
and
transferred
to
another
property
or
the
government,
the
court
has
really
looked
at
two
themes
in
determining
whether
there
has
been
a
taking.
one,
has
the
property
been
completely
transferred
and
extinguished,
which
is
what
occurred
in
this
case,
because
the
employer
pays
all
money
over
to
the
trust
fund
within
60
days
of
the
time
the
claim
is
made,
even
before
there's
a
final
adjudication
on
the
accurate
amount.
and
secondly,
that
money
is
being
put
to
government-directed
use.
this
is
not
a
situation
where,
like
in
the
eagle
feathers
case,
there's
a
statute
passed
and
there
is
no
longer
much
value
to
the
property.
the
property
is
actually
being
taken,
given
to
another
private
person,
and
the
government
has
directed
the
particular
use
of
that
property,
which
is
paying
for
pension
funds.
mr.
richard
m.
freeman
no.
we
claim
that
it
is
all
the
assets
of
the
employer,
the
entire
bundle
of
rights.
mr.
richard
m.
freeman
it's
either
the
money
we
have
to
pay
or
the
entire
assets
of
the
employer
that
have
to
be
liquidated
in
order
to
pay
that
money.
i
would
like
to
point--
mr.
richard
m.
freeman
--yes,
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
webb's
fabulous
pharmacies
the
court
pointed
out
that
there
was
merely
a
contract
right
in
the
claimant
to
the
interest
that
had
been
deposited
in
the
court.
the
claimants
themselves
did
not
have
in
their
possession
the
money.
and
that's
very
similar
to
this
case.
what
we're
asking
the
court
to
do
is
look
past
the
general
statement
of
obligation
and
lock
at
the
fact
that
there
is
money
there:
personalty,
realty,
goodwill,
the
entire
bundle
of
rights
of
the
employer,
with
unlimited
liability,
that
can
he
expropriated
from
the
employer
based
upon
past
acts
and
some
future
acts
which
are
beyond
the
employer's
control.
it's
very
important
for
this
court,
i
believe,
to
keep
in
mind
its
decision
in
amax
coal.
very
recently,
this
court
has
stated
that
trustees
of
union
pension
funds
are
solely
responsible
for
the
funding
of
pensions.
even
without
the
disclaimer
clause
in
this
case,
prior
to
the
enactment
of
this
scheme
there
was
no
liability
on
the
part
of
the
employers
because
there
was
no
promise,
other
than
their
good
faith
promise
in
collective
bargaining
agreement
to
pay
the
level
of
contributions
which
they
agreed
to.
throughout
the
government's
brief,
there
is
an
underlying
theme
of
blame
here,
and
that
is
a
red
herring.
the
employers
are
not
to
blame.
there
are
two
things
going
on
with
this
statute,
both
of
which
the
government
i
believe
directs
towards
the
employer
in
justifying
that
goodness
and
fairness
somehow
ought
to
be
imposed,
should
impose
the
liability
on
them.
one
is
the
withdrawal.
mr.
jett
has
ably
pointed
out
that
withdrawal
is
often
beyond
the
control
of
the
employer.
in
fact,
the
lower
courts
in
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
thompson
building
materials
case,
in
the
pacific
iron
and
metal
case,
which
are
cited
in
the
brief,
point
out
that
most
withdrawals
are
involuntary.
mr.
richard
m.
freeman
yes.
they
were
reached
based
upon
an
inability
to
reach
an
agreement
with
the
union.
and
i'd
like
to
point
out,
as
mr.
jett
did,
that
all
terms
and
conditions
of
an
agreement
relative
to
contributing
to
the
pension
fund,
which
really
establishes
the
level
of
contributions,
could
be
agreed
upon
and
yet,
if
the
union
is
asking
for
a
five
dollar
an
hour
wage
increase,
impasse
is
reached,
and
the
withdrawal
liability
is
assessed.
that
can
hardly
be
blamed
on
the
employer.
by
the
same
token,
the
underfunding
which
is
the
real
problem
in
this
case,
not
the
employer's
withdrawal,
the
underfunding
has
been
in
the
exclusive
control
of
the
trustees.
mr.
richard
m.
freeman
your
honor,
that
is
exactly
what
the
law
provides.
section
302(c)(5)
requires
that
a
written
agreement
between
the
union
and
the
employer
exist
in
order
for
the
employer
to
have
a
right
to
make
those
contributions.
so
that
by
operation
of
law,
regardless
of
the
desires
of
the
employer
to
continue,
he
has
withdrawn
and
the
potentially
debilitating
withdrawal
liability
is
assessed
against
him.
the
government
argues
throughout
its
brief
that
this
case
should
be
decided
on
due
process
rationality
grounds.
it
asserts
that
this
law
is
needed
very
badly
by
the
government.
it
asserts
that
pensions
are
very
good
and
underfunding
is
a
real
problem.
and
it
asserts
that
the
government
really
can't
afford
this
program
and
somebody
ought
to
pay
for
it,
and
let's
make
the
employers
do
it.
well,
i
submit
to
you
you
have
faced
these
arguments
many,
many
times
before
and
rejected
them
on
every
occasion.
the
government's
inability
to
afford
a
program
is
not
a
justification
for
a
taking.
the
government's
desire
to
have
a
good
program
for
the
common
purpose
is
not
a
justification
for
taking
property.
the
issue
here
is
who
is
going
to
pay
for
this
program.
we
don't
argue
with
the
notion
that
pension
funds
should
be
funded.
it's
a
question
of
whether
the
employers
should
have
their
property
taken
to
fund
it
or
whether
the
government
should
fund
it.
mr.
richard
m.
freeman
i
would
say
no,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
m.
freeman
i
would
say
that
that's
what
the
government
would
like
the
court
to
do,
that
somehow
there
is
a
rational
basis
for
this,
or
under
the
due
process
clause.
but
i--
mr.
richard
m.
freeman
--i
would
say
no.
i
would
say
that
that...
we're
talking
about
a
consensual
undertaking
here...
or
a
non-consensual
one.
that
might
be
rational
if
there
had
been
a
consensual
undertaking
to
enter
into
the
risk.
but
here
the
rules
of
the
game
were
set
very
clearly
and
that
risk
was
not
there.
and
unless
you
can
find
blame,
which
i
submit
to
the
court
you
cannot,
on
the
part
of
the
employers,
because
they
have
fulfilled
all
their
obligations,
there
is
no
rational
nexus
there
justifying
this
unlimited
debilitating
liability.
i
can't
strenuously
enough
urge
this
court
to
not
be
misled
by
the
government's
urging
that
this
case
be
analyzed
under
due
process
rationality
grounds,
that
the
court
not
be
lured
into
the
notion
that
because
a
pension
funding
is
a
good
thing
and
because
the
government
program
as
currently
structured
needs
more
money,
that
we
therefore
must
take
from
one
private
party
and
give
to
another
when
the
private
party
having
the
property
taken
from
him
it
is
stipulated
has
had
no
responsibility
for
the
problem
that
is
purportedly
being
solved.
mr.
richard
m.
freeman
yes,
your
honor.
if
there
is
a
forewarning,
if
one
proceeds
and
then
takes
the
risk
in
the
system,
that
is--
mr.
richard
m.
freeman
--yes,
your
honor,
it
would,
because
it
would
involve
taking
property
from
one
party,
transferring
it
to
another,
for
a
reason
totally
beyond
the
control
of
the
party
who
is
being
deprived.
mr.
richard
m.
freeman
i
think
the
record
will
reflect
that
woodward
sand
company
contributed
over
500
or
$600,000
to
the
pension
fund
in
the
history
that
it
had
with
the
trust
fund.
mr.
richard
m.
freeman
approximately
maybe
$100,000
a
year.
thank
you.
