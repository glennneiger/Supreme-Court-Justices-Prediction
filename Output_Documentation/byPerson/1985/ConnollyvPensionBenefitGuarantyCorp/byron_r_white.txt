what
about
premiums?
don't
you
pay
premiums?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
you
win
this
case,
the
premium...
you
don't
pay
premiums?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
that
a
fairly
substantial
interest?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
isn't
that
one
of
the
questions--
justice
byron
r.
white
--raised
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
they're
transferring
money
out
of
your
client's
pocket
to
somebody
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
well,
into
somebody
else's
pocket.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
i
take
it
that
you
must
be
saying,
then,
that
the
statute
could
not
have
just
suddenly
said
that
no
employer
may
withdraw
from
a
pension
plan?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
think
so.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
contract
says
you
can
withdraw
if
you
want
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
this
statute
came
along
and
said,
well,
no,
you
can't,
you
must
go
on
making
your
payments
periodically,
of
course
you
have
got
your
choice.
you
can
either
pay
them
periodically
or
you
can
get
out
and
pay
this
lump
sum.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know.
but
you
don't
need--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
let's
assume
at
the
next
negotiation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
you
come
to
impasse
and
there's
a
strike.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
hire
replacements.
justice
byron
r.
white
for
the
unfunded
for
the
past,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
nevertheless,
here
you
don't
agree
with...
if
you
had
agreed
with
the
union
there'd
be
increased
contributions,
wouldn't
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
there?
if
you
had
agreed
with
the
union
on
a
five
dollars
an
hour
raise,
your
contributions
would
be
higher
than
if
they
didn't
get--
justice
byron
r.
white
--would
you
have
to
make
contributions
to
the
plan
if
you
didn't
agree
with
the
union
or
hired
replacements
who
were
not
union
members
and
you
had
no
relationship
with
the
union
any
more?
would
you
have
to
make
contributions?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
of
course
you
wouldn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
you'd
have
to
pay
the
withdrawal
liability
in
a
lump
sum
right
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
could
pay
it,
he
could
go
on
and
pay
it
based
on
the
old--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
nevertheless,
i
suppose
that
if
you
can't
reach
an
agreement
with
the
union
at
the
next
bargaining
time
and
there's
an
impasse,
would
the
entire
withdrawal
lability
be
assessed
if
you
said:
look,
i'm
willing
to
go
right
ahead
and
make
the
payments
based
on
what
i
have
been
paying.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
think
if
the
statute,
as
well
as
doing
this,
said
that
we're
going
to
make
a
further
adjustment
in
the
burdens
of
economic
life,
we're
going
to
say
that
any
group
of
employers
in
and
any
pension
fund
can
be
required
to
contribute
to
another
pension
fund
in
another
industry
whenever
that
pension
fund
needs
some
money,
is
that
any
different
in
kind?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
certainly
does,
it
certainly
does.
but
nevertheless
it
poses
a
question
i
want
to
ask
you,
so
go
ahead
and
answer
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
it's
property
that
may
not
be
taken
without
due
process
of
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
of
course,
if
an
employer
comes
to
impasse,
there's
a
strike,
he
hires
replacements
and
there's
no
union,
he
has
no
relationship
any
longer
with
the
union
or
with
a
single
person,
not
a
single
one
of
his
prior
employees--
justice
byron
r.
white
--you
just
disagree
with
your
colleague
on
the
other
side?
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
we
reject
the
facial
challenge
because
as
applied
it
was
valid?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
be
invalid,
it
has
to
have
some
particular
effect.
justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
ask
you,
do
you
have
any
response
to
your
colleague's
disagreement
with
you
about
withdrawal
liability
in
a
strike?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
certainly
what
you
said
before,
and
he
heard
you,
but
he
disagrees
with
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
he's
right.
let's
assume
he's
right
and
all
you
have
to
do
is,
which
is
quite
a
bit,
i
know,
to
take
a
strike,
reach
an
impasse,
then--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
what
if
there
was
no
withdrawal
liability
assessed
except
that
you
had
to
go
on
paying
at
the
same
rate
you
did
with
respect
to
the
employees
you
had
up
to
that
date?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
