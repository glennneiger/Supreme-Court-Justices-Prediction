mr.
terry
l.
pechota
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
government's
position
in
oral
argument
and
in
its
briefs
in
this
case
appears
to
be
that
the
bald
eagle
protection
act
and
the
endangered
species
act
abrogated
the
right
of
dwight
dion
as
a
tribal
member
to
take
eagles
while
on
indian
land,
while
on
his
reservation.
in
their
briefs
they
seem
to
say
that
if
it
hasn't
been
shown
that
that
is
the
case,
in
other
words,
that
abrogation
has
not
been
shown
under
the
principles
enunciated
by
this
court,
that
there
seems
to
be
a
limitation,
and
that
is
proper.
lastly,
they
argue
that
unless
indians
are
prevented
from
taking
eagles
for
traditional
cultural
purposes,
that
will
result
in
extinction
of
the
species.
i
would
like
to
address
those
three
points
here
today.
but
before
i
begin,
i
would
like
to
clarify
what
this
case
involves
and
what
it
does
not
involve.
dwight
dion,
sr.,
was
indicted
in
a
multicom
indictment
in
the
united
states
district
court
of
south
dakota.
some
of
those
particular
charges
dealt
with
selling.
others,
three
of
them,
dealt
with
taking.
the
united
states
district
court...
or
rather
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
held
that
he
could
not
be
charged
under
the
bald
eagle
protection
act
or
the
endangered
species
act
for
taking.
that
is
all
that
they
held.
they
did
not
hold
he
could
not
be
prosecuted
for
selling,
or
any
other
indian
could
not
be
prosecuted
for
selling.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
this
case
it
held
that
he
could
be
prosecuted
still,
further
on
the
three
taking
counts
that
are
before
this
court
if
the
government
merely
showed,
number
one,
that
he
was
an
indian,
number
two,
it
happened
on
indian
land,
and
number
three,
that
it
was
for
a
commercial
purpose.
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
the
respondent
has
not
contested
that.
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
that
is
conceded
for
the
purposes
of
this
appeal.
that
is
not
before
the
court
at
this
time.
now,
down
through
the
ages,
the
life
of
this
court,
this
court
has
enunciated
many
times
the
principles
that
are
to
be
followed
in
order
to
abrogate
a
treaty,
and
this
court,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
has
been
in
the
vanguard
of
protecting
indian
treaty
rights,
and
that
is
what
we
are
asking
you
to
do
in
this
case,
your
honors.
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
okay.
first
of
all,
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
in
issue
in
this
case.
number
one,
the
bald
eagle,
for
example,
as
you
have
talked
with
my
counsel
about,
is
not
listed
as
endangered
or
threatened
under
the
endangered
species
act.
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
the
golden
eagle.
excuse
me.
yes.
it
was
included
within
the
bald
eagle
protection
act
not
because
it
was
endangered
or
threatened,
but
because
until
it
was
three
or
four
years
old,
it
was
difficult
for
people
to
tell
the
golden
eagle
from
the
bald
eagle.
people
were
shooting
bald
eagles
and
saying
that
they
thought
it
was
a
golden
eagle.
so
they
included
it
in
there.
that
is
clear
from
the
amendments
that
were
enacted
in
1962.
at
the
same
time
that
those
amendments
were
enacted
in
1962,
and
this
goes
to
the
extinction
argument...
or,
excuse
me.
at
the
same
time
that
this
investigation,
this
sting
investigation
was
undergone
in
south
dakota
from
1981
to
1983,
the
department
of
interior
was
issuing
depredation
permits.
in
other
words,
they
were
authorizing
ranchers
to
shoot
eagles
because
they
were
harm
to
their
sheep
or
their
cows
or
other
types
of
animals,
and
this
is
admitted
by
the
government
in
their
brief
at
footnote
8,
the
reply
brief
at
footnote
8.
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
it
is
not
the
position
here
that
they
give
the
indians
that
right.
number
two,
i
don't
think
that
we
have
that
kind
of
factual
situation
before
the
court,
and
number
three,
i
think
we
are
overlooking
the
fact
that
indian
tribal
governments
have
authority
on
their
reservations
and
many
of
them
have
taken
the
impetus
to
enact
ordinances
that
protect
the
wildlife
that
they
have
on
their
reservations
from
extinction
or
from
abuse
by
hunting
and
fishing.
the
navajos,
for
example,
have
one.
there
was
another
one
cited
in
the
amicus
brief
of
the
parties
here
today
in
the--
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
--i
think
that
the
government
can
abrogate
a
treaty,
there
is
no
doubt
about
it,
if
in
fact
it
does
it
in
the
proper
manner
under
the
principles
that
have
been
enunciated
by
this
court.
if
congress
wants
to
abrogate
a
treaty,
which
they
have
done
in
the
past--
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
--okay.
i
don't
believe
the
treaty
in
this
case
gives
them
the
right
to
hunt
to
extinction.
if
you
are
asking
whether
or
not
the
treaty
in
this
case
authorizes,
gives
the
yankton
sioux
tribe
the
right
to
hunt
and
to
take
eagles,
certainly
that
has
to
be
the
case.
this
court
has
decided
the
menominee
case,
it
decided
the
wynans
case,
the
washington
fishing
vessel
case,
that
have
said
that
when
particular
indian
tribes
have
entered
into
treaties
with
the
united
states
and
given
up
thousands
and
thousands
of
acres
of
land,
they
have
reserved
the
right
to
hunt
and
fish
on
their
reservation.
it
doesn't
have
to
say
that
we
have
the
right
to
hunt
a
particular
species.
now,
in
the
early
part
of
this
century
in
the
leavenworth
v.
kansas
railroad
case,
this
court
said
that
there
has
to
be
an
express
specific
language
of
abrogation,
and
if
there
isn't,
it
is
presumptively
and
conclusively
shown
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
treaty
has
not
been
abrogated.
that
was
an
1876
case.
in
the
menominee
and
the
washington
fishing
vessel
case
that
was
decided
in
the
1970's
it
was
determined
there
the
same
way,
that
absent
explicit
language
of
abrogation,
that
the
treaties
would
not
be
deemed
to
have
been
abrogated.
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
yes.
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
i
think
that
depended
on
the
particular
tribe
that
was
involved.
there
was
some
reference
that
that
was
one
of
the
ways
that
eagles
were
taken
by
indian
tribes.
in
the
record
before
the
district
court
there
were
other
ways
that
were
alluded
to
and
described
that
eagles
were
taken
by
indian
tribes.
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
that's
correct.
there
was
no
evidence
that
eagles
were
ever
used
as
a
purpose
of
sustenance
for
tribal
members.
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
not...
it
hasn't
been
shown
that
these
three
taking
counts,
in
other
words,
when
dwight
dion
took
the
three
eagles,
or
the
five
eagles
that
are
involved
in
this
case,
in
the
three
counts--
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
--but
it
sold
it
later.
he
sold
it
later.
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
he
sold
it.
i
agree
that
there
is
evidence--
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
--and
he
got
money
for
the--
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
--if
in
fact...
if
in
fact--
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
--if
in
fact
he
took
the
eagles
initially--
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
--no.
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
no,
all
i
want
to
protect
is
the
right
of
indian
individuals
to
take
eagles
for
traditional
cultural
purposes.
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
not
all
120
of
them.
the
evidence
in
this
case
does
not
show
that
there
were
ever
taken
nearly
that
many
on
this
reservation.
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
no,
the
evidence--
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
--the
evidence
is
disputed
on
that,
as
i
set
out
in
my
brief.
the
government
says--
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
--there
is
evidence--
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
--that
would
be
correct.
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
and
i
am
not
saying--
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
--i
am
not
saying
that
they
should
be
authorized
to
sell
those
eagles
or
to
take
that
particular--
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
--no,
what
is
involved
in--
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
--no,
it
involves
eagles
that
were
taken.
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
there
was
a
lapse
of
time
in
there
between
the
time
that
they
were
taken
and
the
time
that
they
were
sold.
there
has
been
no
showing
and
no
court
has
held--
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
--yes.
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
i
am
not
sure
that
the
purpose
of--
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
--dwight
dion
is
a
tribal
member
who
by
the
evidence
in
this
case
had
taken
eagles
for
other
purposes,
for
tribal
members
to
use
in
cultural,
traditional
ways.
he
was
the
person
that
primarily
took
the
eagles
on
that
particular
reservation.
and
in
the
meantime
the
government
undertook
this
particular
sting
operation,
and
he
was
contacted,
and
he
did
sell
these
eagles
that
he
had.
now,
whether
he
took
them
initially
for
the
purpose
of
selling
them
or
whether
he
took
them
for
traditional
cultural
purposes
initially
is
a
matter
that
has
to
be
determined
on
remand
when
these
cases
are
tried
if
it
gets
that
far.
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
i
don't
believe
that
the
eagles
are
gone,
your
honor.
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
the
20
eagles
that
he
took
exactly
are
gone.
i
would
like
to
talk
about
the
bald
eagle
protection
act
in
the--
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
--yes.
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
traditional
purposes
include
within
the
context
of
this
case
the
right
to
take
eagles--
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
--to
use
them
in
religious
rites
that
are
used
by
the
yankton
sioux
tribe
of
people.
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
he
found...
the
eagles
that
were
taken
in
this
case?
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
the
eagles
that
were
sold,
or
that
were
taken?
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
i
don't
think
that
the
district
court
found
that
they
were
not
taken
or
that
they
were
not
used
for
cultural
purposes.
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
okay,
i
think
they
are
saying
that
he
took
them
for
commercial
purposes,
the
ones
that
were
sold.
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
well,
that
would
be
the
primary
use.
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
right,
within
the
context
of
this
case.
in
applying
the
principles
for
abrogation
of
treaties
to
the
acts
in
this
case,
the
bald
eagle
protection
act
and
endangered
species
act,
we
start
with
the
bald
eagle
protection
act
that
was
passed
in
1940.
nobody
maintains,
including
the
government,
that
there
was
any
language
in
that
1940
enactment
that
abrogated
any
particular
treaty
right.
from
1940
until
1962
that
particular
act
was
not
applied
against
indians
while
they
were
on
their
reservation.
in
1962,
there
were
some
amendments.
the
amendments
were
to
increase
the
penalties
and
to
include
the
golden
eagle
as
a
part
of
the
particular
statute.
contemporaneous
almost
with
the
enactment
of
that
particular
statute
was
the
1962
memorandum.
that
was
in
april.
this
amendment
was
passed
in
october.
where
the
solicitor
of
the
department
of
interior
indicated
that
the
bald
eagle
protection
act
and
the
migratory
birds
treaty
act
did
not
apply
to
indians
while
they
were
on
their
reservations.
so,
it
is
illogical
and
certainly
would
be
not
really
following
that
if
in
fact
their
solicitor
was
telling
them
that
particular
act
could
not
be
applied
on
the
reservation
that
by
those
1962
amendments
they
thought
that
the
particular
law
was
to
be
applied
or
indian
reservations.
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
i
took
that
quote
in
my
brief--
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
--out
of
the
white--
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
--right.
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
right.
and
that
came
from
the
district
court
decision
in
white.
there
was
the
permit
provision
that
was
included
in
that
1962
amendment,
but
as
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
determined,
certainly
there
were
other
explanations
other
than
that
this
was
to
apply
to
the
indian
reservations
that
could
explain
that
permit
provision
in
that
amendment.
the
eighth
circuit
said
that
there
were
indians
and
non-indians
outside
of
the
reservations,
that
did
not
live
on
the
reservations,
that
certainly
could
and
probably
would
have
been
involved
in
indian
religious
rites
where
these
particular
eagle
feathers
and
parts
of
eagles
could
have
been
used
and
would
have
been
necessary.
so,
this
permit
provision
does
not
apply
by
its
terms
to
indian
reservations.
it
applies
to
indians
everywhere,
whether
or
not
they
are
on
indian
reservations.
certainly
that
is
a
logical
explanation,
and
it
would
seem
according
to
the
respondent
that
that
is
not
sufficient
and
not
sufficient
language
to
result
in
an
abrogation
of
his
right
in
this
particular
case.
now,
from
1962
to
1973,
the
date
of
the
passage
of
the
endangered
species
act,
i
was
not
able
to
find
any
reported
cases
where
the
bald
eagle
protection
act
was
applied
to
indians
in
criminal
matters
while
they
were
on
the
reservation.
in
1973,
the
endangered
species
act
was
passed,
and
there
were
two
provisions
in
that
particular
act
that
the
government
maintains
indicates
that
it
was
the
intent
of
congress
to
abrogate
the
right
of
indians
to
take
eagles
for
traditional
cultural
purposes.
one
of
them
was
the
exemption
that
was
set
in
the
act
for
alaskan
natives.
however,
the
court
must
keep
in
mind
that
two
years
prior
to
1973
congress
had
passed
the
alaskan
settlement
act,
where
the
rights
of
natives
to
hunt
and
fish
had
been
terminated,
had
been
abrogated
in
specific
language,
so
it
was
necessary
to
put
in
the
endangered
species
act
some
protection
for
the
alaskan
natives
and
the
alaskan
indians.
indian
tribes
in
the
lower
48
states
did
not
need
that
particular
protection
because
they
had
the
protection
of
their
reserved
rights.
in
addition,
keep
in
mind
that
the
alaskan
indians
and
alaskan
natives
were
treated
much
differently
than
indian
tribes
in
the
lower
48
states.
they
weren't
treaty
tribes.
earlier
on
this
court
held
that
they
had
no
self-governing
rights,
and
there
were
very
few
reservations
that
were
in
alaska.
and
so,
a
logical
explanation
for
that
and
the
only
explanation
is
that
they
thought
that
they
needed
the
protection
that
the
lower
48
state
indian
tribes
did
not
need.
the
other
provision
that
the
government
points
to
to
show
that
there
is
an
exemption
or
that
there
is
an
abrogation
in
this
case
was
a
bill
that
was
enacted
in
the
92nd
congress,
the
congress
immediately
preceding
the
one
that
passed
the
endangered
species
act,
which
was
the
93rd
congress,
and
in
that
congress,
the
92nd
congress,
there
were
two
bills,
one
that
dealt
with
a
specific
exemption,
in
other
words,
included
a
specific
exemption
for
indians
from
the
act,
one
which
did
not.
both
of
those
particular
bills
died
with
the
92nd
congress
after
the
92nd
congress
adjourned.
they
were
not
introduced
again.
in
the
93rd
congress
the
endangered
species
act
was
passed,
and
so
they
argue
that
because
these
bills
had
been
introduced
in
a
previous
congress
and
died,
that
that
is
some
indication
that
in
the
93rd
congress,
in
its
passage
of
the
endangered
species
act,
that
that
is
some
intent
that
it
was
intended
to
abrogate
the
rights
of
indians
to
take
wildlife
on
their
reservations
for
traditional
cultural
purposes.
as
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
held,
that
they
would
not
sanction
that
kind
of
backhanded
way
of
abrogating
the
treaty
right,
certainly
this
court
has
held
that
unsuccessful
attempts
at
legislation
are
not
the
best
guides
of
legislative
history.
certainly
i
question
whether
or
not
something
that
happened
in
the
92nd
congress
is
proper
legislative
history
for
something
that
subsequently
took
place
in
the
93rd
congress.
they
also
point
out
in
their
briefs
that
there
were
some
remarks
of
subcommittee
counsel
in
the
92nd
congress
who
questioned
whether
or
not
the
indians
should
be
given
an
exemption.
and
of
course
the
relevance
of
that
is
certainly
questionable
and
of
no
value
to
the
court
even
if
it
could
rise
above
the
principles
that
remarks
of
people
in
opposition
to
legislation
are
given
little
or
no
weight.
i
submit
to
you
that
when
the
legislative
history
in
these
acts
are
locked
at,
that
there
is
no
indication
whatsoever
of
any
intent
on
the
part
of
congress
to
abrogate
indian
treaty
rights,
certainly
not
the
kind
of
evidence,
the
kind
of
material
that
has
to
be
shown
under
the
principle
that
there
has
to
be
a
clear
expression
that
indian
rights
are
going
to
be
abrogated
either
in
the
legislative
history
or
either
on
the
face
of
the
act.
all
of
the
provisions,
both
of
the
provisions
that
the
government
talks
about
in
support
of
its
position
here
have
logical
reasons
for
being
included
in
this
particular
bill.
the
legislative
history
does
not
say
that
we
intended
by
any
of
the
provisions
that
the
government
points
out
here,
that
we
intended
to
abrogate
the
right
of
indians
to
hunt
while
on
their
reservation.
the
government
also
makes
the
point
in
its
brief
that
there
really
is
not
an
abrogation
here,
because
indians
can
secure
eagle
parts
through
the
permit
system
under
the
bald
eagle
protection
act.
first
of
all,
i
would
submit
to
you
that
any
time
that
you
have
to
go
through
an
administrative
procedure
where
that
particular
individual
making
the
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
you
are
entitled
to
something,
especially
when
you
have
a
reserve
right
to
take
it
in
the
first
place,
to
have
it,
is
an
abrogation
and
limitation
on
the
right
of
indians
to
take
eagles,
and
it
must
be
so
in
this
case.
in
the
case
of
tulee
v.
washington,
this
court
previously
held
in
discussing
an
in
common
right
involving
fishing
rights
of
indians
in
the
northwest
that
to
require
them
to
get
a
state
license
is
an
abrogation
of
their
right,
and
the
same
principle
should
apply
in
this
particular
case.
in
addition,
under
that
permit
provision,
there
have
been
no
permits
that
have
been
issued
to
allow
indians
to
take
eagles.
all
the
eagle
or
eagle
parts
that
indians
have
been
able
to
get
have
been
from
the
pocatel
repository
in
idaho,
and
they
come
in
decomposed
bags
where
indians
have
to
wait
a
year
to
a
year
and
a
half
to
get
eagles
that
they
need
and
that
they
have
the
right
to
use
in
their
indian
cultural,
religious
rights.
i
think
it
is
an
understatement
and
erroneous
to
say
that
that
limitation
and
that
permit
provision
is
not
an
abrogation
of
indian
hunting
rights
as
shown.
now,
the
government
also--
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
--it
is
contrary
to
take
an
eagle.
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
that's
right.
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
no.
it
is
illegal
to
possess--
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
--a
particular...
the
government
also
contends
here
that
if
indians
are
allowed
to
take
eagles
for
traditional
cultural
purposes,
that
the
eagle
is
going
to
be
rendered
extinct.
there
is
nothing,
absolutely
nothing
in
the
legislative
histories
of
these
bills
that
we
are
dealing
with
here
today,
the
bald
eagle
protection
act
or
the
endangered
species
act,
to
show
that
the
impact
of
indians
being
able
to
take
these
eagles
for
traditional
purposes
is
going
to
have
any
kind
of
an
impact
whatsoever.
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
there
is
evidence--
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
--and
if
he
sold
them,
and
i
concede
that
he
sold
them--
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
--right,
he
did
sell
them.
and
if--
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
--if
someone
does
sell
them,
then
certainly
there
is
not
a
traditional
culture
purpose,
and
they
are
not
included
within
the
holding
of
the
dion
case.
prosecution
certainly
would
be
authorized,
and
if
you
have...
something
like
that
occurs,
certainly
there
is
something
that
can
be
done
by
the
federal
government.
that
is
a
prosecution.
there
has
been
no
evidence
even
in
the
reauthorization
hearings
that
were
held
that
the
government
makes
reference
to
in
this
last
summer,
1985,
about
indians
being
allowed
to
take
these
particular
eagles
would
render
them
extinct.
within
the
context
of
this
case,
the
government
says
that
the
karl
mundt
refuge
is
located
adjacent
to
the
reservation.
or
the
record
of
this
case,
the
manager
of
that
wildlife
refuge
was
called
to
testify,
and
he
had
not
mentioned
or
he
had
not
observed
or
noticed
any
diminution
in
the
population
of
the
eagles
on
that
reserve
during
the
time
that
this
sting
operation
was
in
effect
for
the
past
two
years.
the
point
of
it
is,
even
if
conservation
is
a
proper
way
under
the
puyallup
kinds
of
decisions
to
abrogate
a
treaty
right,
which
i
do
not
agree
with,
but
even
if
you
use
that
particular
standard,
there
has
to
be
shown
something
to
indicate
that
there
is
an
impact
on
the
particular
species
by
indian
takings.
they
have
not
been
shown
in
this
case
at
any
place,
so
we
have
statutes
that
do
not
clearly
abrogate
treaties,
nor
do
we
have
any
showing
that
indian
takings
would
result
in
the
extinction
of
the
gold
eagle
or
the
bald
eagle.
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
i
don't
think
you
would
have
to
have
a
litigation
if
they
said,
by
this
particular
statute
we
clearly
intend
to
abrogate
the
rights
of
indians
under
their
treaties.
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
i
don't
believe
that
that's
sufficient
to
abrogate
the
right
of
indian
people
to
exercise
their
rights,
their
reserved
rights
under
their
treaties.
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
no.
first
of
all,
i
disagree
with
the
puyallup
decisions.
i
talk
about
these
in
my
brief.
second
of
all--
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
--if
you
accept
puyallup
and
there
is
a
finding
that
as
a
reasonable
conservation
measure
you
have
to...
you
have
to
prevent
indians
from
taking
eagles
to
a
certain
extent,
then
under
puyallup
that
would
be
proper.
mr.
terry
l.
pechota
if
in
fact
there
was
a
congressional
finding
under
puyallup
and
you
agree
that
puyallup
should
apply
in
this
case,
which
i
don't,
then
i
agree
that
that
would
be
sufficient.
i
have
no
further
comments.
