are
you
saying
that
the
department
of
interior
says
that
this
does
not
exist?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean,
the
interior
department
can't
locate
its
own
files?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
this
is
impossible.
this
is
impossible.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
do
you
account
for
the
fact
that
they
have
it
and
the
interior
department
doesn't
have
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
in
this
particular
case
it
was
solely
for
money.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he
sold
it
to
an
agent.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
sold
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
got
money
for
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
sale
for
profit.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
nothing.
that
is
sale
for
profit.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
is
what
you
want
to
protect.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
want
to
protest
his
right
to
kill
off
100
more
of
these,
and
that
is
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
120
of
them.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
evidence
shows
that
one
man
took
20.
justice
thurgood
marshall
over
a
period
of
a
year.
justice
thurgood
marshall
whether
it
is
disputed
or
not,
there
is
evidence
that
one
man
took
one-twentieth,
which
is
of
120.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
five
more
did
it,
that
is
the
end.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
want
me
to
sit
by
and
see
that
happen.
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
that
what
is
involved
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
doesn't
this
case
involve
eagles
that
were
sold?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
sold
to
the
agents.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
there
is
a
lapse
of
time,
they
were
sold.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
was
the
purpose
of
taking
them.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
other
purpose
was
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
eagles
are
gone.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
those
20
are
gone.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
there
is
no
traditional
purpose
in
this
case.
he
sold
them.
is
that
traditional?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
commercial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
he
sold
them?
he
did
sell
them.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
do
you
keep
saying
traditional?
