now,
what
sort
of
legislative
history
do
you
feel
that
is
that
supports
your
position?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
grade
f
or
grade
e
perhaps?

justice
william
h.
rehnquist
having
been
assured
by
the
chairman
of
the
subcommittee
that
the
coverage
of
a
particular
act
that
had
been
passed
many
years
before
was
such
and
such.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
do,
too,
but
the
question
is,
how
much
additional
weight
do
you
give
to
this
little
transaction
on
the
house
floor?
it
seems
to
me
it
is
pretty
close
to
the
bottom
of
the
barrel.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
we
are
not
talking,
as
i
understand
it,
about
a
floor
statement
at
the
time
that
the
bill
in
question
was
passed,
whose
coverage
we
are
now
trying
to
ascertain.
we
are
talking
about
a
floor
statement
many
years
later.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
we
didn't
mean
that
all
floor
statements
should
be
brought
to
our
attention.

may
i
ask
you
about
something
that
is
perhaps
more
contemporaneous
with
the
enactment?
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
the
memorandum
from
the
office
of
the
solicitor
of
the
department
of
the
interior
that
is
quoted
in
your
adversary's
brief
at
page
21
that
a
treaty
indian
is
not
subject
to
the
migratory
bird
treaty
act
while
on
his
own
reservation?
do
you
think
that
is
simply
an
incorrect
statement,
or
you
disavow
it,
or
what?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
feel
the
public
interest
is
something
different
than
the
statutes
and
treaties
involved
here?
that
is
another
element
of
the
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
i
thought
you
were
just
entering
into
a
discussion
of
the
public
interest
after
having
concluded
your
discussion
of
the
statutory
and
treaties.
but
this
is
just
another
ramification
of
the
treaty
and
legislative
argument?
