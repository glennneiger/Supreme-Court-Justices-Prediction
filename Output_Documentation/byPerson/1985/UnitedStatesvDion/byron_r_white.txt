is
it
contrary
to
the
federal
statute
to
just
capture
an
eagle?
justice

in
any
way.
justice

it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
you
kill
it
or
hurt
it
or
not?
justice

white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
congress
had
in
the
statute
itself
or
in
the
legislative
history
clearly
said
that
it
is
absolutely
essential
because
of
the
dangers
of
extinction
to
safeguard
both
the
bald
eagle
and
the
gold
eagle,
and
that
was
a
congressional
finding,
would
you
say
you
nevertheless
would
have
to
have
a
litigation
about
that
conclusion
in
the
specific
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
they
didn't
say
that,
but
they
just
say
in
the
preamble
or
in
the
body
or
the
legislative
history
that
we
find
that
the
bald
eagle
is
in
danger
of
extinction,
and
any
taking
of
them
must
be
forbidden,
and
in
order
to
achieve
that
end
we
must
protect
the
golden
eagle,
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
in
this
case
if
there
had
been
evidence
out
on
about
the
bald
and
the
gold
eagle
and
the
dangers
and
threats
to
them,
and
the
judge
had
found
that
it
is
necessary
not
to
recognize
a
treaty
right
in
order
to
keep
the
bald
eagle
from
being
extinct,
what
if
there
had
been
a
finding
like
that
in
this
case?
i
take
it
you
agree
that
then
the
treaty
right
would
not
override
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
we
accept
puyallup.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
say
that
would
have
to
be
found
in
a
case,
that
a
congressional
finding
to
that
effect
would
not
suffice?
