mr.
minear,
may
i
ask
the
status
of
what
it
is
we
are
reviewing?
i
guess
the
en
banc
court
remanded
to
a
panel
of
the
eighth
circuit.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
panel
on
remand
found
that
the
takings
were
for
commercial
purposes.
and
i
take
it
that
is
not
contested.
that
is
not
an
issue
any
more.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
are
we
being
asked
to
review
the
en
banc
judgment
that
occurred
before
the
remand?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
all
we
are
looking
at
is
the
question
of,
if
it
is
not
for
a
commercial
purpose
and
not
for
a
religious
purpose.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
the
government
conceded
that
the
golden
eagles
were
not
endangered,
but
that
when
they
were
young
they
resembled
bald
eagles,
and
therefore
as
a
prophylactic
measure
the
government
decided
to
prohibit
the
taking
of
either.
is
that
correct?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
about
the
golden
eagle
population?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
have
comparable
statistics
on
golden
eagle
population?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
respondent
hasn't
contested
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
concede
that
the
treaty
does
not
incorporate
taking
for
commercial
purposes?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
we
first
have
to
know
whether
the
right
to
hunt
to
extinction
of
a
species
is
included
in
the
treaty
rights.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
golden
eagle.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
we
go
back
for
just
a
moment
to
determine
whether
it
is
your
position
that
the
treaty
gives
the
tribe
and
its
members
a
right
to
hunt
eagles
to
their
extinction?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
the
treaty
doesn't
include
the
right
to
hunt
to
extinction,
then
perhaps
it
is
open
to
the
federal
government
to
regulate
hunting
to
extinction.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
if
the
treaty
doesn't
cover
it,
it
isn't
a
question
of
abrogation
of
the
treaty
at
all.
