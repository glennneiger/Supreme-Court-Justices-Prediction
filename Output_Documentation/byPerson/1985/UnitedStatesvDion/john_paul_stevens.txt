right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
whether
it
still
exists
or
not,
you
don't
question
that
it
did
at
one
time
exist?
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
may
not
have
the
original
copy
of
hamlet,
either,
but
we
know
what
it
says.

justice
john

i
know,
but
generally...
i
know
the
court
has
frequently...
mr.
cohen's
work
on
indian
law
and
so
forth
has
been
treated
almost
like
the
bible
from
time
to
time,
and
i
guess
this
is
the...
i
don't
know
whether
this
was
felix
cohen
or
solicitor
margo.
i
am
not
sure
which
it
was.
but
i
assume
that
it
has
often
been
given
a
little
more
deference
that
some
internal
memoranda.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
your
position
it
is
just
simply
wrong?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
preliminary
question,
counsel?
i
am
over
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
start
from
the
premise
that
there
is
a
treaty
right,
and
is
the
right
one
to
kill
the
eagles,
because
i
notice
in
the
house
legislative
history
there
was
a
suggestion
that
historically
the
tribe
did
not
actually
kill
the
eagles,
but
rather
trapped
them
and
was
able
to
get
their
feathers
without
actually
destroying
the
eagle.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
you
think
it
is
clear
there
was...
at
least
there
was
a
right...
they
were
not,
i
take
it,
not...
this
is
not
a
right
to
hunt
and
fish
for
purposes
of
food.
it
is
only
the
ceremonial
purpose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
you
shed
any
light
on
the
authenticity
and
the
authorship
of
this
memorandum?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
out
of
the
opinion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
just
comes
from
the
office
of
the
solicitor--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
we
don't
know
just
how
high
up
the
particular
author
was.
