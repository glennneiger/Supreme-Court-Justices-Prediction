mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
an
indian
may
assert
tribal
hunting
rights
as
a
defense
to
prosecution
for
taking
wildlife
in
violation
of
federal
conservation
statutes.
the
focus
in
this
case
is
on
protection
of
our
national
symbol,
the
bald
eagle,
a
majestic
but
endangered
species.
despite
extensive
federal
protection
under
the
bald
eagle
act
and
the
endangered
species
act,
the
eagle
remains
the
frequent
object
of
black
market
trade.
in
1980,
the
department
of
interior
initiated
a
major
undercover
operation
to
halt
the
illegal
killing
and
sale
of
eagles
in
south
dakota.
respondent,
a
yankton
sioux
indian,
was
among
those
apprehended.
at
trial,
the
united
states
produced
extensive
evidence
that
respondent
had
engaged
in
a
series
of
eagle
transactions
over
a
two-year
period
in
which
he
had
offered
to
kill,
killed,
and
sold
eagles
for
profit
to
undercover
agents
posing
as
indian
crafts
dealers.
the
jury
found
respondent
guilty
of
killing
bald
eagles,
in
violation
of
the
endangered
species
act,
and
of
selling
eagles
and
other
protected
birds
in
violation
of
the
bald
eagle
act
and
the
migratory
bird
treaty
act.
the
united
states
court
of
appeal
for
the
eighth
circuit
sitting
en
banc
partially
vacated
respondent's
conviction.
the
court
concluded
that
yankton
sioux
indians
have
an
implied
treaty
right
to
hunt
eagles
for
noncommercial
purposes.
the
court
further
concluded
that
neither
the
bald
eagle
act
nor
the
endangered
species
act
demonstrated
sufficient
congressional
intent
to
limit
that
right.
the
court
stated
that
the
united
states
could
retry
respondent,
but
the
government
would
be
required
to
prove
that
respondent
had
taken
the
eagles
for
commercial
purposes.
the
united
states'
position
in
this
case
is
straightforward.
we
submit--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that
is
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
we
don't
believe
that
it
is
contested.
this
is
a
finding
that
the
court
of
appeals
panel
did
make.
it
made
it
in
the
context--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
that
is
right.
the
issue
that
this
court
is
reviewing
is
whether
or
not
this
affirmative
defense
in
fact
exists.
we
submit
that
there
is
in
fact
no
commercial
or
noncommercial
taking
defense
for
indians
in
these
cases.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
foreclosed
takings
and
made
them
illegal
in
the
other
situations.
continuing,
we
submit
that
congress
does
not
compromise
indian
hunting
rights
by
an
act
of
general
prohibition
on
the
taking
of
wildlife
applicable
to
indians
and
non-indians
alike,
designed
to
prevent
extinction
of
the
species.
in
this
instance,
congress
has
given
special
protection
to
the
nation's
severely
threatened
eagle
population
through
the
bald
eagle
act
and
the
endangered
species
act.
as
congress
plainly
recognized,
these
statutes
require
nationwide
coverage,
and
cannot
function
effectively
unless
everyone
is
subject
to
the
conservation
regime.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
your
honor,
the
congress
has
made
that
determination
in
its
1962
amendments
to
the
bald
eagle
act.
as
a
preamble
to
its
statutory
amendments,
it
stated
that
the
bald
eagle
act--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
they
did
treat
them
somewhat
differently,
although
both
are--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--in
both
cases,
bald
eagles
and
golden
eagles,
the
prohibitions
apply
to
both
of
these
eagles,
in
both
cases.
the
only
difference
of
any
great
substance,
i
think,
is
that
in
668,
the
provision
that
permits
the
secretary
to
allow
certain
limited
takings,
and
he
prescribed
those
by
regulation,
while
in
the
case
of
the
bald
eagle
they
can
only
be
taken
by
permit.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
is
quite
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
okay.
your
honor,
the
bald
eagle
act
was
amended
in
1962.
in
the
preamble
to
that
act,
congress
stated--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
stated
that
it
had
two
purposes
for
extending
protection
to
the
gold
eagle.
one
was
to
prevent
the
eminent
extinction
which
congress
realized
could
occur
given
the
large
number
of
takings
that
were
occurring
at
that
time.
in
addition,
congress
also
noted
that
the
immature
bald
eagle
was
indistinguishable
from
the
golden
eagle,
and
for
that
reason
protection
was
also
extended
to
the
golden
eagle,
to
prevent
any
inadvertent
takings
of
the
bald
eagles.
as
this
time
the
golden
eagle
is
not
listed
as
an
endangered
species.
it
has
not
been
listed
under
the
endangered
species
act
as
an
endangered
species.
we
nevertheless
submit
that
there
is
a
substantial
threat
to
the
golden
eagle
population.
we
submit
that
there
is
no
real
conflict
between
indian
hunting
rights
and
the
federal
statute.
this
conclusion
is
not
only
sensible,
it
is
consistent
with
the
yankton
sioux
treaty,
the
statutory
language,
and
the
nation's
vital
interest
in
protecting
endangered
species.
we
turn
first
to
the
indian
treaty
itself.
the
1858
treaty
with
the
yankton
sioux
makes
no
mention
whatsoever
of
specific
indian
hunting
rights,
much
less
the
right
to
hunt
eagles.
the
treaty
did
not,
of
course,
prohibit
the
tribe
from
continuing
to
hunt
game
on
its
reserved
lands.
however,
it
did
not
give
them
an
absolute
and
unfettered
right
to
take
eagles
regardless
of
consequences.
when
the
treaty
was
negotiated,
both
parties
prized
eagles,
the
united
states
as
its
national
symbol
since
1782,
and
the
indians
as
a
sacred
object.
neither
party
recognized
that
wildlife
resources
were
exhaustable,
and
neither
contemplated
how
eagles
might
be
allocated
if
they
later
became
scarce.
certainly
under
these
circumstances
the
government
does
not
surrender
through
silence
its
sovereign
power
and
responsibility
to
protect
eagles
for
future
generations.
instead,
the
government
retained
that
right
as
an
exercise
of
its
tribal
trust
authority
and
for
the
public
at
large.
likewise,
the
yankton
sioux,
who
considered
the
capture
of
an
eagle
a
sacred
activity,
had
no
reason
to
expect
that
the
treaty
gave
them
an
absolute
right
to
kill
eagles.
indeed,
unlimited
indian
hunting
of
eagles
would
destroy
the
very
treaty
right
they
now
claim.
in
short,
whatever
hunting
rights
the
yankton
sioux
might
possess,
they
do
not
have
an
absolute
right
to
conduct
hunting
activities
that
threaten
the
survival
of
a
species
that
is
of
great
importance
to
the
entire
nation.
an
examination
of
the
bald
eagle
act
and
the
endangered
species
act
leads
to
the
same
result.
congress
plainly
intended
that
these
statutes,
framed
in
terms
of
universal
application,
would
apply
to
indian
tribes.
it
is
well
settled
that
federal
laws
of
general
application
generally
do
apply
to
indians,
and
this
principle
has
been
firmly
established
since
the
1930's,
prior
to
enactment
of
these
statutes.
contrary
to
respondent's
arguments,
there
was
no
need
for
congress
expressly
to
include
indians
in
the
coverage
of
these
acts.
these
statutes
do
not
abrogate
any
indian
treaty
right.
instead,
they
impose
reasonable
regulations
that
are
consistent
with
the
preservation
of
those
rights.
given
the
migratory
nature
of
eagles,
the
species
can
only
be
preserved
and
restored
to
its
original
numbers
if
all
are
subject
to
the
conservation
regime.
in
turn,
all
will
ultimately
benefit
from
the
fruits
of
this
conservation
program.
thus
there
is
no
direct
conflict
between
indian
hunting
rights
and
the
federal
conservation
statutes.
they
can
be
reconciled
in
much
the
same
manner
that
property
rights
are
subject
to
zoning
restrictions.
in
all
events,
the
bald
eagle
act
and
the
endangered
species
act
amply
meet
the
higher
standard
that
respondent
suggests.
both
statutes
on
their
face
show
that
congress
considered
the
special
cultural
and
religious
interests
of
indians
and
balanced
their
needs
against
the
conservation
purposes
of
these
statutes.
for
example,
the
bald
eagle
act
provides
a
limited
exception,
authorizing
the
secretary
to
permit
indians
to
use
eagles
for
religious
purposes.
the
endangered
species
act
also
contains
a
limited
exception,
authorizing
alaskan
natives
to
take
endangered
species
for
subsistence
purposes.
these
carefully
limited
exceptions
applicable
to
particular
indian
activity
demonstrate
that
congress
intended
these
statutes
to
apply
to
the
indian
tribes.
moreover,
application
to
the
indians
is
necessary
if
the
broad
conservation
goals
of
these
statutes
are
to
be
met.
the
nation's
240
indian
reservations
have
a
population
of
approximately
750,000
people.
they
encompass
a
land
area
of
approximately
50
million
acres,
much
of
it
wildlife
habitat.
surely
it
is
unlikely
that
congress
would
have
silently
excluded
the
indians
and
their
extensive
land
holdings
from
the
coverage
of
these
acts.
indeed,
this
point
was
recently
reiterated
during
the
pending
reauthorization
of
the
endangered
species
act.
the
house
subcommittee,
informed
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
this
case,
held
hearings
to
consider
the
need
for
a
legislative
response.
the
subcommittee
ultimately
concluded
that
there
was
no
need
to
address
this
issue
in
the
reauthorization
bill.
representative
breaux,
chairman
of
the
subcommittee
and
sponsor
of
the
house
bill,
explained
this
decision
on
the
house
floor.
he
stated,
"h.r.
1027
does
not
contain
an
amendment
relating
to
the
take
of
endangered
species
by
native
americans
for
traditional
purposes.
"
"while
there
have
been
conflicting
court
decisions
on
this
issue,
it
is
clear
from
the
language
of
the
esa
and
the
legislative
history
that
the
act
is
a
nondiscriminatory
conservation
statute
that
applies
to
all
citizens
equally.
"
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
it
probably
could
be
characterized
as
insipient
legislative
history.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
at
this
point
the
house,
shortly
after
this
statement
was
made,
the
house
passed
the
reauthorization
bill,
and
the
action
is
now
pending
in
the
senate.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
i
think
that
that
is
reasonable.
it
is
a
reasonable
reading
of
the
statutory
language.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
do
believe,
your
honor,
that
it
is
relevant
and
should
be
brought
to
the
court's
attention.
i
think
this
court
has
stated
in
other
contexts
that
how
statements
should
be
given...
or
floor
statements
are
entitled
to
less
respect
than
legislative
reports.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
was
a
1962
memorandum,
an
internal
memorandum.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it
was
quoted
in
the
white
opinion.
i
have
not
seen
that
memorandum.
i
am
not
sure
it
even
still
exists,
for
that
matter.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
it
certainly
did
exist
at
one
time,
and
it
was
quoted,
but
what
i
am
pointing
at,
your
honor--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--but,
your
honor,
i
am
not
sure
what
context
that
was
said
in.
i
guess
that
is
my
primary
point
on
this.
but
i
think
if
we
are
going
to
look
at
secondary
sources
for
congressional
intent,
there
are
a
lot
of
conflicting
indications
during
this
period,
from
the
1940
period,
when
the
bald
eagle
act
was
originally
passed,
until
1962.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
we
are
not
even
sure,
your
honor,
this
was
in
fact
from
the
solicitor
himself.
the
indication
is
only
that
it
is
a
memorandum
from
the
office
of
the
solicitor.
so
it
could
very
well
have
been
a
staff
person's
memorandum.
we
simply
don't
know
what
level
of
authority
this
memorandum
came
from.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
i
think
that
it
is
inaccurate.
i
think
that
that
is
verified
by
the
interior
department's
action
immediately
after
the
passage
of
the
1962
amendments,
in
which
case
they
extended
the...
they
provided
the
religious
exception
would
only
apply
to
bona
fide
indians,
and
it
seems
to
me
their
interpretation
of
the
religious
exception
clearly
contemplated
that
this
statute
would
apply
to
the
indians.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no,
we
have
simply
been
unable
to
locate
that
particular
memorandum.
i
have
not
been
able
to--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--sometimes
it
is
difficult
to
find
memoranda
that
are
20
years
old.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
cannot
say
it
is
impossible,
no.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
believe
that
they
just
cited
the
white
opinion,
which
quoted
this.
i
am
not
sure
if
mr.
pechota
has
a
copy
of
the
memorandum
or
not.
perhaps
he
can
elaborate
on
that.
we
submit
the
bald
eagle
act
and
the
endangered
species
act
amply
demonstrate
congressional
intent
to
regulate
indian
activities.
but
the
government's
position
is
not
only
consistent
with
the
relevant
treaties
and
statutes;
it
is
also
consistent
with
the
public
interest
in
protecting
endangered
species.
the
threat
to
the
bald
eagle
is
quite
real.
recent
statistics
indicate
that
there
are
only
12,000
remaining
bald
eagles
in
the
lower
48
states.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
it
is
something
that
again
should
be
given
consideration.
the
statute
should
be
construed
in
order
to
effectuate
its
purposes.
and
i
think
that
congress
did
intend
to
protect
the
bald
eagle
through
the
bald
eagle
act.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
essentially
it
is,
your
honor.
what
i
am
trying
to
indicate
is
that
the
actual
statistics
that
indicate
the
threat
to
the
bald
eagle
in
this
case,
just
so
that
the
court
understands
the
seriousness
of
the
concern
of
the
interior
department
in
this
area.
the
peak
population
at
the
karl
mundt
wildlife
refuge
near
where
these
eagles
were
taken
is
only
120
birds.
and
this
small
refuge,
which
is
located
directly
across
the
river
from
the
yankton
sioux
reservation,
is
one
of
the
nation's
most
important
eagle
sanctuaries.
in
this
case,
respondent
himself
sold
seven
bald
eagles
to
undercover
agents
in
a
six-month
period,
and
he
told
agents
that
he
killed
as
many
as
20
eagles
in
the
course
of
a
year.
bald
eagles
are
also
found
on
105
other
indian
reservations.
thus
continued
taking
by
other
indians
claiming
similar
treaty
rights
poses
a
very
real
threat
to
the
bald
eagle
population.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it
is
less
clear
that
there
is
an
immediate
threat
to
the
golden
eagle
population.
since
the
passage
of
the
1962
amendments
to
the
bald
eagle
act,
there
has
been
some
extensive...
much
greater
protection
to
the
eagles.
nevertheless,
the
department
of
interior
indicates
they
have
a
total
of
about
1,100
eagle
killing
cases
since
1983.
many
of
these
are
golden
eagles.
the
total
population--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
believe
the
best
statistics
that
we
have
that
i
received
from
interior.
there
are
approximately
60,000
gold
eagles,
most
of
these
located
in
the
western
united
states.
there
are
very
few
nesting
pairs
in
the
eastern
united
states,
which
used
to
be
a
portion
of
their
natural
habitat.
more
generally,
if
federal
conservation
statutes
are
subordinated
to
indian
hunting
rights,
other
important
species
will
be
threatened.
a
number
of
other
wildlife
preserves
are
located
in
close
proximity
to
and
in
some
cases
within
indian
reservations.
a
number
of
important
species,
including
the
grizzly
bear,
the
grey
wolf,
and
the
florida
panther,
are
all
sometimes
found
on
indian
lands.
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
this
case
seriously
undermines
the
government's
ability
to
enforce
the
bald
eagle
act
and
the
endangered
species
act.
we
ask
this
court
to
restore
the
enforcement
powers
that
congress
intended.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
mr.
chief
justice,
unless
the
court
has
questions,
we
will
waive
rebuttal.
