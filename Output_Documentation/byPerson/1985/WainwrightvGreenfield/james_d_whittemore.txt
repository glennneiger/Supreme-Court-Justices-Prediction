mr.
james
d.
whittemore
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
why
we
are
here
is
because
a
state
a
prosecutor
chose
to
take
advantage
of
a
defendant's
exercise
of
his
constitutional
rights,
to
infer
to
the
jury
that
there
is
some
meaning
to
that
exercise.
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
there
was
no
objection,
and
the
trial--
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
--there
is
a
distinction,
your
honor,
between
the
mere
testimony
that
the
man
remained
silent
and
asked
for
an
attorney
and
the
use
of
that
silence,
the
use
of
that
constitutional
right
which
has
been
exercised
to
draw
meaning.
that
is
why
i
would
suggest
we
are
speculating
to
a
point
and
to
a
point
we
are
not,
because
there
was
an
evidentiary
proceeding
before
the
magistrate
in
which
the
trial
counsel...
in
which
i
asked
the
trial
counsel,
why
did
you
not
object?
he
simply
said
the
bell
didn't
ring.
i
don't
know
whether
i
didn't
hear
it
or
whether
i
didn't
place
significance
on
it,
but
when
i
heard
the
prosecutor
making
much
of
it,
i
objected
and
did
everything
i
could
to
preserve
it.
i
think,
your
honor,
that
that
is
a
sufficiently
related
objection.
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
unfortunately,
we
don't
know.
it
was
an
off
the
record
bench
conference.
it
is
in
parentheses
in
the
record.
it
was
an
off
the
record
conference.
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
yes.
what
counsel
responded
or
how
he
responded
in
our
evidentiary
proceeding
was
that
he
cited
to
the
court
the
case
law
as
he
understood
it
at
the
time,
which
was
in
essence
the
pre-doyle
cases
precluding
comment
upon
the
exercise
of
rights
under
the
griffin
case.
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
absolutely.
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
he
has
waived
his
fifth
amendment
rights
by
speaking
to
the
officer.
i
assume
that
he
has
been
mirandized.
he
then
tells
the
officer
that
he
is
going
to
play
his
trump
card,
come
into
court
and
fool
the
psychiatrist.
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
well,
the
recent
opinions
of
this
court
suggest
that
the
mirandizing
is
a
significant
point
in
time.
the
fletcher
versus
weir
case.
up
until
that
mirandizing
of
the
defendant,
he
is
fair
game.
his
silence
can
be
used
if
he
testifies.
in
our
case,
of
course,
the
defendant
did
not
testify,
which
is
a
strong
distinguishing
factor
from
the
fletcher
case,
from
the
jenkins
v.
anderson
case.
it
is
not
an
impeachment
case
here.
it
is
a
rebuttal.
and
that
is
why
those
cases
are
helpful
but
not
controlling.
if
we
look
strictly
at...
and
by
the
way,
i
want
to
preface
my
next
remark.
i
have
reframed
the
issue
for
this
court
to
make
sure
that
we
are
talking
about
the
silence
of
the
then
defendant
greenfield
and
not
his
post-miranda
behavior.
i
think
it
is
perfectly
appropriate,
and
it
was
in
this
case,
that
his
post-warnings
behavior,
his
actions,
his
physical
characteristics--
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
--that,
your
honor--
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
--i
would
suggest
that
a
reading
of
edwards
versus
arizona
suggests
that
when
a
defendant
requests
an
attorney,
that
is
a
per
se
exercise
of
his
fifth
amendment
right,
and
that
is
in
that
opinion,
and
i
agree
with
it
very
strongly.
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
it
is
not
silence,
but
it
is
the
exercise,
the
invocation
of
that
right
to
silence,
and
that
is
also
protected
by
the
prophylactic
protection
of
miranda.
the
reason
we
have
the
miranda
warnings,
it
was
very
clear
in
that
opinion.
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
i
think
a
reading
of
the
edwards
case
in
miranda
suggests
that,
yes,
he
can
selectively
choose
to
answer--
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
--under
one
circumstances
only...
one
circumstance
only.
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
i
think
it
depends
more
that
the
defendant
takes
the
stand
during
his
trial
and
testifies
inconsistently
with
what
occurred
in
that
scenario.
the
footnote
in
doyle
very
explicitly
says--
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
--no,
sir,
and
the
reason
for
that,
and
this...
we
tread
upon
or
venture
into
the
evidentiary
issue
here,
and
i
don't
think
it
is
a
proper
issue
for
this
court
to
address.
it
is
an
issue
for
the
trial
court,
but
doyle
addresses
it.
i
don't
think
doyle
was
decided
based
on
the
evidentiary
issue.
doyle
was
decided
based
upon
the
fundamental
unfairness
of
penalizing
a
defendant
in
the
exercise
of
his
rights
by
using
that
silence
by
commenting
upon
it
during
the
trial,
after
he
had
been
warned.
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
i
think
that
opinion
addressed
the
ambiguity
of
silence
because
doyle
addressed
at
length,
but
a
close
reading
of
doyle
is
clear,
it
shows
that
the
court
turned
on
the
fifth
amendment
fundamental
fairness
issue,
and
not
so
much
the
ambiguity.
in
fact,
in
a
footnote
to
doyle,
this
court
said,
we
need
not
address
whether
silence
is
probative.
we
only
note
that
in
united
states
versus
hale
we
noted
its
insolubly
ambiguous
nature.
i
think
the
eleventh
circuit
in
attempting
to
fit
this
case
within
doyle
necessarily
had
to
address
the
ambiguity
of
the
silence
because
there
are--
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
--in
this
case
it
is
absolutely
irrelevant,
because
the
experts
tell
us
and
the
amicus
briefs--
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
--irrelevant,
is
my
point,
the
silence.
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
no,
sir,
but
it
was
the
function
of
the
eleventh
circuit
to
apply
doyle,
and
the
two--
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
--no,
sir,
i
do
not
suggest
that
at
all.
what
doyle
does
tell
us
is
that
when
a
defendant
is
advised
of
his
rights
and
thereupon,
thereafter
remain
silent,
we
don't
know
whether
he
is
invoking
his
silence
under
the
constitutional
right
or
whether
he
simply
was
afraid,
whether
he
became
paranoid,
whether
he
simply
became
mute
because
he
was
in
a
hostile
environment.
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
i
think
the
reason
the
court
did
that,
your
honor,
and
i
agree--
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
--pardon
me?
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
yes,
sir,
i
do,
because
i
think
it
had
to
draw
the
distinction
between
those
cases
which
have
been
decided
where
there
is
a
pre-miranda
silence
and
the
court
has
allowed
impeachment
of
the
testifying
defendant
by
that
silence
on
the
basis
that
the
silence
prior
to
miranda
was
so
inconsistent
with
the
testimony
during
trial
that
it
was
proper
impeachment,
and
the
eleventh
circuit
necessarily
had
to
address
that
to
explain
why
in
this
instance
silence
is
not
inconsistent
with
that
defense--
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
--that
is
because,
your
honor,
the
case
of
doyle
addressed
it,
and
i
think
the
eleventh
circuit--
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
--addressed
the
probative
value
of
silence
after
miranda.
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
two-fold.
one,
to
show
the
absence
and
necessity
for
using
silence
because
the
prosecutor
had
available
to
him
all
of
the
behavioral
aspects
of
this
encounter
without
treading
upon
the
exercise
of
a
constitutional
right.
that
necessity
issue
has
been
advanced
by
the
state
throughout
these
proceedings.
we
must
have
this
evidence
to
rebut
insanity.
necessity
was
rejected
in
doyle,
and
in
this
case
it
should
be
rejected
because
it
simply
wasn't
necessary
to
use
the
man's
silence
after
miranda.
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
no,
sir,
i
don't.
i
don't
think
that
is
what
the
eleventh
circuit
was
saying.
i
think
the
eleventh
circuit
was
simply
quoting
the
prosecutor
at
length,
because
to
take
one
or
two
comments
out
of
context
may
give
this
case
a
terribly
awkward
and
perhaps
erroneous
atmosphere.
the
prosecutor
must
be
quoted
at
length,
because
it
shows
how
he
went
through
the
pre-miranda
activity,
behavior
of
the
defendant
through
the
victim,
through
the
officer
who
arrested
him,
and
then
the
man
was
mirandized,
and
then
he
invoked
his
right
to
silence.
and
i
think
the
point
that
the
eleventh
circuit
was
drawing
from
that
is
that
not
only
was
it
not
necessary
to
go
to
that
extreme,
but
in
this
case
the
insolubly
ambiguous
nature
of
silence
is
evidenced
by
that
argument.
we
don't
know
why
he
remained
silent.
if
the
court,
and
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
that
there
may
be
instances
where
silence
may
be
probative.
this
is
very
clear
from
their
opinion.
they
simply
said
in
determining
probative
value
of
silence
we
must
look
at
all
of
the
characteristics,
and
not
simply
the
fact
that
he
remained
silent.
the
point
that
we
making
was--
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
--it
is,
your
honor.
it
is
not
a
matter
for
a
federal
court
sitting
in
a
habeas
proceeding
to
determine.
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
perhaps
relevant,
but
at
least
it
does
not
tread
upon
a
constitutional
right.
i
am
suggesting
in
my
layman's
approach
i
would
consider
it
relevant--
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
--well,
the
silence
itself
or
the
behavior?
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
perhaps,
your
honor,
i
should
revisit
the
scenario
you
have
explained.
i
understood
it
to
mean
the
behavior
of
the
defendant
prior
to
arrest
as
opposed
to
his
exercise
of
a
right.
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
yes,
but
he
is
not
exercising
a
constitutional
right.
he
is
in
essence...
yes,
he
is
making
an
admission
to
the
officer.
he
is
telling
the
officer
what
he
is
going
to
do
to
fool
the
psychiatrist
and
the
jury
and
the
judge,
and
he
has
waived
his
fifth
amendment
right.
that
is
very,
very
important
in
this
instance.
had
greenfields
began
talking
to
the
officer
instead
of
remaining
silent,
he
would
have
waived
that
right,
and
everything
he
said
would
have
been
admissible
for
whatever
reason,
as
an
admission
or
as
a
confession
or
as
perhaps
even
impeachment
if
he
testified,
but
there
is
a
distinction,
your
honor,
between
pure
behavior
or
demeanor
evidence
and
the
invocation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
that
is
the
protected
right.
i
would
suggest
here,
and
i
have
cited
a
case,
the
kaufman
case
out
of
the
eighth
circuit,
the
observed
physical
characteristics
of
a
defendant,
including
comments
made
after
waiving
miranda,
are
always
admissible.
whether
they
are
relevant
or
not
is
a
matter
for
the
trial
judge
to
determine
based
on
the
nature
of
the
condition,
the
nature
of
the
psychiatric
evidence
and
expert
testimony.
the
distinction
is
pre-miranda,
post-miranda,
and
whether
the
man
has
remained
silent
after
being
mirandized.
that
is
the
fundamental
unfairness
issue
that
has
been
framed
by
the
eleventh
circuit.
it
is
the
eleventh
circuit
holding,
consistent
with
doyle,
that
once
the
defendant,
regardless
of
his
defense,
is
mirandized,
if
he
remains
silent,
it
is
impermissible
to
comment
upon
that.
the
only
exception
would
be
if
the
defendant
testified,
testified
inconsistent
with
that
silence.
for
example,
if
he
told
the
jury,
i
told
all
this
to
the
police
when
i
was
arrested,
and
the
prosecutor
then
brought
on
the
police
officer
to
impeach
that
testimony,
i
would
suggest
it
is
admissible,
and
doyle
recognized
that
it
would
be
admissible.
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
no,
sir,
and
i
surely
don't
agree
with
that
statement
of
the
law
by
the
second
d.c....
the
second
district
court
of
appeals.
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
i
would
note
that
the
greenfield
decision
before
the
florida
appellate
court
was
specifically
disapproved
by
the
florida
supreme
court
approximately
three
weeks
before
we
argued
this
case
to
the
eleventh
circuit.
in
state
versus
berwick,
cert
denied
about
a
year
ago,
the
florida
supreme
court
exercised
conflict
certiorari
jurisdiction
under
the
florida
constitution,
the
conflict
being
between
the
greenfield
appellate
decision
and
the
berwick
case
out
of
another
district
court
of
appeals.
in
the
berwick
case,
the
florida
supreme
court
said
very
specifically,
we
disagree
with
the
second
district
court
of
appeals,
they
were
wrong,
there
is
no
probative
value
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
it
was
fundamentally
unfair
to
comment
upon
this
man's
silence,
and
thereupon
issued
its
opinion,
which
is
a
very
well
thought
out
opinion
and
addresses
doyle
and
all
of
the
constitutional
ramifications.
so,
that
is
the
issue--
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
--i
believe
so.
unfortunately,
it
came
a
bit
late.
that
case,
berwick,
is
very
significant
for
two
reasons.
one,
the
florida
supreme
court
disapproved
of
greenfield,
set
the
course
of
florida
law,
but
secondly
and
more
importantly
on
the
waiver
issue,
the
sikes
issue,
if
the
florida
supreme
court
recognized
that
the
second
district
court
of
appeals
opinion
was
precedent
setting
sufficient
to
invoke
its
conflict
certiorari
jurisdiction,
obviously,
the
appellate
court
reached
the
merits
in
a
two-page
opinion
of
the
issue.
therefore
it
is
properly
preserved,
and
that
is
why
the
magistrate
held
as
it
did,
that
the
appellate
court
had
addressed
the
merits,
the
state
court
had
allowed
the
procedural
default
to
be
tolerated,
and
think
obviously
recognizing
that
the
man
had
objected
to
the
closing
argument
of
the
prosecutor,
and
i
would
just
quote,
if
i
could,
from
the
second
district
court
of
appeals
opinion,
which
was
disapproved.
it
was
neither
unfair
to
introduce
it
nor
improper
to
comment
upon
it
in
summation,
the
second
district
court
of
appeals
thereby
addressing
the
merits
of
this
issue.
it
was
preserved
for
federal
habeas
review.
wainwright
v.
sikes
does
not
apply.
the
magistrate
was
correct
in
ruling
that
it
was
preserved.
this
court
has
never
specifically
to
my
knowledge
in
an
opinion
announced
a
rule
that
if
the
state
court
overlocks
the
procedural
default
and
addresses
itself
to
the
merits,
wainwright
v.
sikes
does
not
apply.
i
am
asking
this
court
to
rule
specifically
in
this
case.
it
is
a
good
opportunity
to
reiterate
what
was
said
in
sikes,
that
we
deal
only
with
contentions,
and
i
am
quoting,
"of
federal
law
which
were
not
resolved
on
the
merits
in
the
state
proceeding
due
to
the
failure
to
raise
it.
"
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
the
general
rule
is
as
petitioner
has
put
it
in
her
reply
brief.
it
is
fair
comment.
if
the
evidence
comes
in
without
objection,
it
is
fair
comment.
now,
the
problem
i
have
with
that--
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
--pardon
me?
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
it
has
not
been
argued
until
the
briefs
filed
with
this
court,
and
i
would
suggest--
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
--the
arguments
for
the
lawyers
are
merely
argument.
their
recollections
are
different
from
the
jury.
the
jury
should
discount
their
recollections.
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
i
think
he
was
doing
more
than
that,
judge.
i
think
he
was
drawing
meaning
from
that
silence.
he
was
drawing
an
inference.
perhaps
from
a
logical
sense
it
appears
logical.
from
an
emotional
stand
point,
we
want
to
think
that
silence
after
miranda
is
important
and
meaningful,
but
what
the
prosecutor
is
doing
is
drawing
an
inference
without
an
empirical
and
factual
basis,
simply
suggesting
to
the
jury
if
he
was
smart
enough
to
invoke
his
rights,
then
he
knew
what
he
was
doing.
the
experts
tell
us
that
that
does
not
necessarily
mean
the
man
was
insane
at
the
time
of
the
offense.
the
question
is,
are
only
sane
individuals--
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
--approximately
two
hours.
the
question
is,
are
only
sane
individuals
able
to
invoke
their
constitutional
rights?
i
suggest
that
we
can't
answer
that.
you
have
to
presume
that
all
individuals
can
exercise
rights
specifically
when
they
are
just
informed
that
they
have
these
rights.
they
are
simply
exercising
the
right
which
they
have
just
been
told
they
have
available
to
them.
i
don't
think
that
we
can
draw
distinctions
between
insanity
defenses
and
self-defense
cases,
consent
cases,
all
the
other
cases
where
affirmative
defenses
were
advanced,
and
say
that
in
this
one
instance
we
will
allow
you
to
use
a
defendant's
invocation
of
his
fifth
amendment
right.
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
i
don't
think
it
is,
judge.
a
reading
of
doyle,
if
he
invokes
his
right
to
counsel,
if
he
invokes
his
right
to
silence,
he
is
invoking
a
right--
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
--that
is
in
my
mind
tantamount
to
an
invocation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
why
else
would
he
want
a
lawyer
but
to
be
with
someone
who
can
advise
him
of
his
options,
someone
who
is
not
against
him,
someone
who
can
advise
him
of
whether
to
make
an
intelligent
decision?
the
very
basis
for
the
miranda
ruling
is
to
assure
an
intelligent
and
knowing
decision.
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
admissible
for
impeachment
purposes.
or
for
admission
or
confession--
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
--your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that
that
is
the
faulty
premise
on
which
sulie
versus
duckworth
and
the
trujillo
decisions
were
based,
and
that
is
merely
because
a
man
asks
for
a
lawyer
does
not
suggest
that
he
is
sane.
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
that
is
not
my
only
answer,
judge.
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
that
invocation
of
his
right
to
counsel
which
he
has
just
beer
advised
of
in
effect
under
the
evans
case
is
an
invocation
of
his
right
to
remain
silent.
they
are
one
and
the
same.
i
don't
think
we
can
arbitrarily
distinguish
the
miranda
right
to
counsel,
which
is
the
court
granted
right,
and
the
fifth
amendment
right.
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
i
think
you
have
to
consider
that
in
the
context.
if
the
lawyer
request
is
made,
anything
derived
thereafter
if
initiated
by
the
officer
would
be
subject
to
being
suppressed
under
the
edwards
case.
if
the
request
for
a
lawyer
is
made,
the
interrogation
must
stop.
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
and
if
he
answer
because
i
am
smart
enough,
i
don't
need
to
talk
to
a
lawyer,
think
that
would
be
admissible.
if
he
waives
that
fifth
amendment
right,
that
privilege,
and
engages
in
conversation--
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
--i
think
i
would
have
to
say
it
would
be,
because
i
think
at
that
point
he
is
engaged
in
unprotected
activity.
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
that
is
the
distinction
i
made
in
restating
the
issue,
your
honor,
and
that
is
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
behavior
and
demeanor
evidence
that
is
observed,
and
the
exercise
of
a
constitutional
right
which
has
traditionally
been
protected
by
this
court
and
the
majority
of
the
lower
courts.
there
is
that
artificial
distinction,
and
the
reason
there
is
a
distinction
is
because
of
the
miranda
warnings.
in
fletcher
v.
weir
this
court
recognized...
up
until
that
point
in
time
all
is
fair.
everything
is
admissible.
once
the
rights
are
administered,
and
there
is
the
invocation
of
silence
or
the
right
to
counsel
thereafter,
that
is
the
protected
speech.
that
is
the
protected
exercise
of
a
constitutional
right
which
cannot
be
used
for
any
purpose
unless
the
defendant,
of
course,
perjures
himself
on
the
stand
and
says
that
he
didn't
remain
silent,
he
told
the
police
his
defense.
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
i
think,
judge,
if
you
are
invoking
a
constitutional
right
for
a
prosecutor
to
thereafter
use
that
assertion,
whether
it
is
a
request
for
counsel
or
i
don't
want
to
say
anything,
your
honor,
of
silence,
is
treading
upon
protected
exercise
of
a
right.
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
yes,
sir.
it
is
putting
a
penalty
on
the
exercise
of
that
right.
it
is
making
the
exercise
costly.
it
is
telling
a
defendant
on
the
one
hand
you
have
these
rights,
and
then
two
or
three
months
down
the
road,
in
the
middle
of
the
trial,
telling
him,
we
are
going
to
use
your
exercise
of
those
rights
notwithstanding
we
told
you
you
had
them.
that
is
the
penalty
which
doyle
proscribes.
that
is
the
penalty
which
miranda
proscribes,
not
to
penalize
a
defendant
for
the
exercise
of
those
rights.
that
is
the
fundamental--
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
--oh,
i
think
it
does.
i
think
the
distinction
between
sanity
and
guilt,
i
think,
is
artificial.
in
this
case,
it
was
an
insanity
defense.
the
burden
was
on
the
state
to
prove
sanity
by
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
the
sanity
of
that
defendant
was
an
important
link
in
the
chain
to
guilt.
there
is
a
distinction,
obviously,
between
the
issue
of
sanity
and
the
issue
of
the
commission
of
the
physical
acts,
which
was
not
really
in
dispute
in
this
case.
there
is
a
distinction,
but
from
the
standpoint
of
is
it
evidence
leading
toward
guilt,
yes,
it
is.
it
is
a
link
in
the
chain
toward
guilt.
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
he
surely
can,
and
that
is
why
he
must
make
an
intelligent
waiver
of
that
right,
judge.
that
is
why
the
miranda
rights
are
given.
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
i
guess
you
could
say
that,
but
he
has
waived
the
fifth
amendment
right,
which
is
the
most
significant
right
that
we
are
dealing
with
that
is
why
we
are
here,
and
as
i
said
when
i
started,
here,
because
there
is
the
use--
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
--there
is
no
ranking
of
rights
in
my
opinion,
judge.
it
is
simply
a
right
which
is
so
cherished
in
our
history
and
back
in
the
star
chambers.
the
man
does
not
have
to
speak.
he
should
not
be
convicted
out
of
his
own
mouth,
from
his
own
lips.
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
i
don't
think
it
is
an
impairment
at
all.
if
a
man
takes
the
stand
and
waives
his
right
of
silence,
he
is
waiving
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
and
he
is
subject
to
impeachment
if
he
testifies.
and
that
is
the
common
thread
in
the
harris
v.
new
york
case,
in
the
fletcher
case,
and
in
the
jenkins
v.
anderson
case.
every
one
of
those
defendants
testified.
mr.
james
d.
whittemore
i
am
not
suggesting
that
he
can
be
impeached
by
his
exercise
of
the
right
to
silence.
i
am
suggesting
the
only
time
that
can
occur
is
if
he
takes
the
stand
and
denies
having
remained
silent.
and
that
is
the
example
used
in
the
footnote
in
doyle,
that
if
a
man
testifies
and
says,
no,
i
told
the
police
everything
that
i
have
just
told
you,
and
in
fact
he
did
remain
silent,
i
think
that
is
fair
game
for
impeachment,
and
i
don't
think
the
court
addressed
it
specifically,
but
it
surely
suggested
that
that
would
be
proper
impeachment.
thank
you.
