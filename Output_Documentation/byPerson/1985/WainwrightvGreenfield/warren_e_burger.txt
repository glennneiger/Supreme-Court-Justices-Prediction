we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
wainwright
against
greenfield.
ms.
paschall,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
suppose
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
understand
which
kind
of
a
case
they
were
reviewing,
and
they
think
they
were
reviewing
a
trial
in
the
district
court
rather
than
the
state
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
whittemore.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
was
no
objection
to
the
testimony
when
it
went
in,
was
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
what
could
be
objectionable
about
talking
about
it
later?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
there
a
request
then
by
the
judge
to
go
back
and
strike
that
testimony
and
instruct
the
jury
to
disregard
the
testimony?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
such
a
claim
was
made,
the
counsel
could
assert
that
it
was
made
in
an
off
the
record
bench
conference,
could
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
since
the
issue
here
is
the
conduct
post-miranda
warning,
let
me
ask
you
a
hypothetical
question
which
may
or
may
not
have
any
relevance.
suppose
he
had
said
affirmatively
to
the
officer,
i
have
read
a
lot
of
books
on
psychology.
i
took
psychology
when
i
went
to
college,
and
i
read
about
schizophrenia
and
antisocial
behavior,
and
i
know
the
symptoms,
and
when
i
get
into
court,
i
am
just
going
to
put
on
an
act
with
all
these
symptoms.
i
know
what
they
are.
the
policeman
then
might
say,
in
my
hypothetical,
well,
you
may
be
able
to
fool
the
judges,
but
you
will
never
be
able
to
fool
the
psychiatrists,
and
he
goes
on
to
say,
yes,
i
know
as
much
about
this
as
the
psychiatrists
do.
i
know
all
the
symptoms,
and
i
will
make
it
now.
would
that
conversation
be
admissible?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
admissible?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
he
said
that
before
he
got
the
miranda
warning.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
whittemore,
when
i
put
that
rather
bizarre
hypothetical
to
you
a
while
ago,
you
said
that
evidence
would
be
admissible.
now,
i
didn't
quite
understand
why
you
thought
that
would
be
admissible.
would
it
be
admissible
because
it
was
relevant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
virtually
amounts
to
a
confession,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
speaking
of
the...
i
will
use
the
adjective
bizarre.
the
bizarre
hypothetical
i
gave
you
added
up
to
a
confession
virtually,
didn't
it?
from
that
a
jury
could
reasonably
infer
guilt,
so
it
was
a
very
damaging
statement,
and
you
thought
it
was
admissible,
at
least
as
i
understood
your
response.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
he
says
is
part
of
his
behavior,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
general
rule
about
the
relative
standing
of
statements
made
by
lawyers
in
summing
up
arguments
for
evidence
in
a
case,
which
is
higher
quality?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
wasn't
applied
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
wasn't
applied
here
by
the
court
of
appeals.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
not
sure
i
made
my
question
clear.
when
a
judge
instructs
a
jury,
what
does
he
tell
them
about
the
relative
standing
of
evidence
given
by
witnesses
as
compared
with
arguments
made
by
lawyers?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
the
jury
believed
the
evidence
which
they
heard
from
a
witness
here
and
disregarded
the
evidence...
disregarded
the
arguments
of
the
lawyers
as
they
were
instructed.
then
what
is
the
relevance
of
the
lawyer's
arguments?
all
he
is
doing
is
telling
them
what
the
evidence
was.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
that
evidence...
does
that
kind
of
evidence
that
justice
rehnquist
was
probing
at
go
to
the
issue
of
guilt?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
the
right
to
remain
silent
is
of
a
higher
constitutional
order
than
the
right
to
testify
in
your
own
defense?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
of
course,
the
courts
have
never
said
that
in
that
way.
in
response
to
justice
white's
question,
you
say
that
of
course
when
he
once
takes
the
stand
he
can
be
impeached
completely
by
what
he
has
said
previously
even
if
what
he
said
previously
is
inadmissible
in
chief.
that
is
certainly
an
impairment
of
an
important
constitutional
right
to
testify,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
do
you
have
anything
further,
ms.
paschall?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
