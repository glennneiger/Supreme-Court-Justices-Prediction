justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
paschall,
just
reviewing
the
quotation
that
the
eleventh
circuit
made
on
pages
a9,
all
of
the
brief,
petitioner's
brief
on
jurisdiction,
a
lot
of
the
prosecutor's
references
there
strike
me
as
not
having
been
addressed
to
the
defendant's
silence
at
all
coupled
to
his
behavior
before
he
ever
received
the
miranda
warning.
supposing
the
issue
were
just
guilt
and
not
insanity.
wouldn't
some
of
that
be
able
to
come
in
under
doyle?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
really
just
boils
down
to
a
couple
of
sentences
of
the
prosecutor's
argument,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
the
whole
thing
relied
on
by
the
eleventh
circuit.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
business
is
it
of
a
federal
court
to
decide
whether
evidence
in
a
state
criminal
proceeding
is
relevant
or
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
if
it
is
a
legal
conclusion,
we
usually
lead
to
terminations
as
to
what
a
florida
court
did
to,
you
know,
a
magistrate
or
a
district
court
that
sits
in
florida,
or
a
court
of
appeals
opinion
written
by
a
judge
from
jacksonville.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
then
say
that
the
eleventh
circuit's
discussion
of
lack
of
relevance
here
is
just
unnecessary
to
its
opinion
even...
the
issue
is,
no
matter
how
relevant,
it
still
can't
come
in.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
it
is
absolutely
relevant
or
absolutely
irrelevant.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
say
that
doyle
establishes
the
rule
that
federal
courts
decide
what
evidence
is
admissible
and
relevant
in
a
state
trial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
court
of
appeals
went
much
further
than
that.
it
wasn't
just
talking
about
silence
being
relevant.
it
discussed
other
actions
relied
on
in
the
prosecutor's
summation,
and
apparently
said
they
weren't
relevant
either.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
defend
its
doing
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
defend
its
doing
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
if
you
take
a
look...
perhaps
you
have
the
opinion
in
mind,
the
long
quotation
from
the
prosecutor
that
the
eleventh
circuit
has
fairly
early
in
its
opinion.
it
is
on
a9
to
all
of
the
petitioner's,
the
white
petitioner's
brief
on
jurisdiction.
it
strikes
me
that
the
first
two-thirds
of
a
prosecutor's
summary
quoted
by
the
court
of
appeals
has
nothing
to
do
with
silence.
it
is
talking
about
what
the
fellow
did
when
he
was
arrested,
what
he
said
before
he
got
the
miranda
warning,
and
yet
the
eleventh
circuit
seems
to
have
relied
on
all
of
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
my
point
is
that
the
eleventh
circuit
here
relied
on
numerous
things
in
the
prosecutor's
summary
that
refer
not
to
silence
at
all
but
to
actions
or
remarks
before
the
miranda
warnings
were
given.
how
do
you
defend
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
i
have
been
trying
to
get
across
to
you
in
my
questions,
and
perhaps
i
am
not
succeeding
in
doing,
is,
as
i
read
the
prosecutor's
summary,
at
least
the
first
half
of
it
is
not
devoted
to
silence
at
all.
it
is
devoted
to
acts
that
took
place
before
the
miranda
warnings
were
given.
now,
do
you
defend
that
part
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
that
says
that
part
of
the
prosecutor's
summary
was
unconstitutional?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing...
i
mean,
you
say...
can
no
invocation
of
a
constitutional
right
ever
be
used
as
evidence?
supposing
the
fellow
goes
before
the
committing
magistrate
or
the
trial
judge
for
arraignment
and
says
i
demand
a
lawyer,
i
have
got
a
right
to
the
lawyer
under
the
sixth
amendment.
may
no
one
ever
refer
to
that
statement?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
just
to
refer
to
the
fact
that
a
person
asserted
a
constitutional
right
somehow
impinges
on
that
right.
