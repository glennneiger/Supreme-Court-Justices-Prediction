justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
one
of
the
events
that
is
the
most
meaningful,
i
gather,
with
respect
to
the
insanity
defense
is
that
he
asked
for
a
lawyer?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
hardly
silence.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
his
request
for
a
lawyer?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
not
silence.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
it
isn't
silence.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
they
give
him
his
miranda
warnings,
and
they
start
asking
him
some
questions,
he
never
asks
for
a
lawyer,
he
answers
this
question,
and
then
he
answers
that
one,
and
then
he
was
asked
another
question.
he
says,
i
don't
want
to
answer
that
one.
he
answers
some
others,
and
then
every
now
and
then
he
says
i
don't
still
want
to
answer
that
question.
do
you
think
that
line
of
questioning--
--i
suppose
they
could
introduce
the
questions
that
he
answered.
could
they
say...
could
they
introduce
it
and
say,
he
refused
to
answer
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
could
they
point
out
that
he
refused
to
answer
some
questions?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
question
is
whether
he
had
sense
enough
to
answer
some
and
not
answer
others,
and
can
they
introduce
the
whole
question
and
answer
session?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
they
could
use
it
to
prove
that
he
was
sane.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
did
more
than
say...
it
did
more
than
say
it
is
ambiguous.
it
said
it
was
not
relevant,
and
disagreed
with
two
other
circuits
that
said
it
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
what
this
court...
that
is
what
the
eleventh
circuit
said.
do
you
say
that
is
the
job
of
a
federal
court
or
of
an
amicus
brief
from
some
psychiatrist
to
tell
a
state
court
what
evidence
is
relevant
in
a
criminal
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
long
had
elapsed?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
officer
administers
the
miranda
warnings,
and
he
says,
do
you
understand
what
i
have
said
and
what
this
means?
the
answer
is
yes.
do
you
understand
you
may
have
a
lawyer
before
i
interrogate
you?
yes.
do
you
want
me
to
call
a
lawyer?
now,
is
that
colloquy
admissible?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
hasn't
invoked
his
right.
he
has
invoked
his
right
to
a
lawyer.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
was
never
told.
if
you
are
talking
about
doyle,
doyle
didn't
say
that
what
you
say
may
not
be
used
against
you.
it
said
that...
you
say
that
any
answer
to
a
question
that
he
made
voluntarily
is
admissible
about
the
historical
facts.
he
has
given
his
miranda
warnings.
he
has
asked
some
questions
about
what
happened,
and
he
answers.
admissible,
because
he
has
waived.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
no,
no,
no,
in
chief.
you
said,
and
i
agree
with
you,
that
if
he
waives
his
right
and
answers
these
questions,
and
he
was
never
told...
he
wasn't
told
that
what
he
says
wouldn't
be
used...
he
was
told
that
what
he
says
would
be
used
against
him,
and
he
is
asked,
do
you
want
a
lawyer,
and
he
says
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
that
isn't...
if
that
is
your
only
answer,
you
must
lose
your
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
have
answered
that
that
violates
his
fifth
amendment.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
officer
says,
why
do
you
want
a
lawyer,
and
he
tells
him,
and
that
would
be
admissible
too,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
says,
do
you
want
a
lawyer,
and
he
says
no.
he
says,
why
don't
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
it
would
be
admissible
for
proving
sanity?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
saying
no
and
saying
yes,
i
want
a
lawyer,
wouldn't
be
admissible
to
prove
sanity?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
look
what
happens
to
a
defendant
when
he
decides
to
testify
at
trial.
he
is
exercising
a
constitutional
right
to
testify,
but
he
can
certainly...
he
can
certainly
suffer
a
lot
from
exercising
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
so
he
is
penalized
in
a
way
for
exercising
his
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
is
told
in
his
miranda
warnings
what
you
say
won't
be
used
against
you,
or
will
be
used
against
you,
but
you
have
a
right
to
remain
silent.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
say
if
miranda
warnings
were
never
give
and
he
was
interrogated
and
they
wanted
to
use
the
statements
to
prove
sanity,
and
the
reason
they
want
to
use
them
is,
they
seem...
anybody
would
conclude
that
this
is
very
relevant
as
to
his
competence,
but
he
never
was
given
a--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
if
disproving
the
insanity
defense
is
just
completely
different
from
guilt
or
innocence,
why
would
you
draw
a
distinction?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
thank
you.
