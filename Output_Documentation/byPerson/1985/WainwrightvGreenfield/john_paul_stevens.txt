justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question?
am
i
correct
that
the
appellate
court
in
florida
didn't
do
any
balancing,
but
it
just
held
one
who
pleads
the
insanity
as
a
defense
waives
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination?
is
that
their
analysis?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
state
court
did
not
balance
the
way
you
suggest.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
respond
to
your
opponent's
argument
that
since
the
appellate
court,
i
guess
after
the
florida
supreme
court
had
it,
they
sent
it
back
to
the
appellate
court,
and
then
they
decided
it
on
the
merits.
doesn't
that
sure
the
wainwright
failure
to
object
problem,
when
the
state
court
addresses
the
merits?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
really
don't
understand
why
they
would
do
that
if
they
thought
that
it
was...
if
there
wasn't
a
problem
on
the
merits,
why
would
they
ask
the
appellate
court
to
take
a
second
look
at
it.
the
appellate
court
ruled
in
favor
didn't
of
the
prosecutor
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so
what
they
did
is,
your
view
is,
they
sent
it
back
to
say,
isn't
there
a
different
reason
for
ruling
in
favor
of
the
prosecutor?
justice
john
paul
stevens
appellate
courts
generally
don't
do
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
suppose
at
the
time
you
filed
your
brief
on
the
merits
in
the
court
of
appeals,
that
is,
the
federal
court
of
appeals,
the
reason
you
didn't
argue
wainwright
against
sikes
must
have
been
that
you
thought
the
appellate
court
had
addressed
the
merits.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
shouldn't
speculate
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
they
said
in
their
footnote
was
that
the
florida
district
courts
of
appeals'
willingness
to
address
the
merits
solves
the
problem,
and
i
think
you
agree
with
that
if
they
did
in
fact
address
the
merits,
so
the
question
is
only
whether
they
addressed
the
merits
or
not,
isn't
it,
not
whether
they
stated
the
law
incorrectly.
that
is
what
the
footnote
says,
anyway,
that
you
called
cur
attention
to.
and
the
magistrate
concluded
that
the
florida
courts
had
addressed
the
merits,
did
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
question
about
florida
law?
the
appellate
court
apparently
said
that
when
you
plead
insanity
as
a
defense,
you
give
up
your
fifth
amendment
privilege.
could
he
have
been
put
on
the
stand
by
the
prosecutor
if
they
had
elected
to
in
the
trial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
are
saying
no
matter
how
we
decide
this
case,
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
the
result
will
be
the
same
in
florida
anyway?
that
is
interesting.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
correct
that
in
that
case
they
construed
the
federal
question
the
same
way
the
eleventh
circuit
did?
