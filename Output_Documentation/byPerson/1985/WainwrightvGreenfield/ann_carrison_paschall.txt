ms.
ann
carrison
paschall
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
respondent
david
greenfield
was
convicted
in
a
jury
trial
of
sexually
battery
committed
with
force
likely
to
cause
serious
personal
injury.
respondent's
conviction
was
affirmed
by
the
florida
appellate
courts,
and
his
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
relief
was
denied
by
the
federal
district
court
for
the
middle
district
of
florida.
the
eleventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
decision
of
the
district
court
and
ordered
a
new
trial.
this
case
presents
two
issues.
the
first,
and
perhaps
the
most
critical,
whether
the
state
may
use
a
defendant's
most-miranda
warning
behavior,
including
his
post-miranda
warning
silence,
as
evidence
of
his
sanity
at
or
near
the
time
of
the
offense.
the
second
issue,
simply
stated,
is
whether
the
eleventh
circuit
either
ignored
or
misconstrued
wainwright
versus
sikes
in
holding
that
respondent's
failure
to
timely
object
to
the
testimony
that
he
challenged
in
this
cause
could
be
excused
by
20
subsequent
objections
to
the
prosecutor's
closing
argument.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
somewhat
important,
and
i
want
to
go
into
them
very
briefly.
respondent
was
charged
with
sexual
battery.
he
initially
pled
not
guilty,
and
then
prior
to
trial
changed
that
plea
to
one
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity.
in
other
words,
his
defense
was
that
at
the
time
of
the
crime,
he
was
not
sufficiently
aware
to
know
the
nature
of
the
act
that
he
was
committing
or
to
know
that
it
was
wrong,
to
be
able
to
distinguish
that
which
was
right
from
wrong.
the
state
presented
proof
that
the
offense
was
committed,
and
then
offered
the
testimony
of
officer
russell
pilafont
regarding
the
arrest
of
respondent
some
two
hours
after
the
offense.
officer
pilafont
indicated
that
greenfield
met
the
description
that
he
had
and
he
placed
him
under
arrest.
he
escorted
greenfield
down
to
the
police
car,
read
him
his
miranda
rights.
greenfield
went
on
and
said,
yes,
i
understand
them,
i
think
i
would
like
to
talk
to
an
attorney.
in
the
police
car
on
the
way
to
the
station
the
officer
again
elaborated
on
those
rights.
the
officer...
greenfield
said,
yes,
thank
you
very
much
for
explaining
that
to
me,
i
do
think
i
would
like
to
speak
to
an
attorney
before
i
talk
with
you.
another,
police
officer
gave
similar
testimony
regarding
greenfield's
behavior
once
he
arrived
at
the
police
station,
and
no
objection
was
made
to
the
police
officer's
testimony
at
the
time
that
it
came
in.
both
sides--
ms.
ann
carrison
paschall
--yes,
they
gave
the
traditional--
ms.
ann
carrison
paschall
--yes,
they
did.
ms.
ann
carrison
paschall
and
they
advised
him...
at
the
police
station
he
said
that
he
would
like
to
speak
to
an
attorney,
and
they
contacted
the
public
defender's
office
for
him,
and
he
was
indeed
able
to
speak
to
an
attorney
from
the
public
defender's
office.
ms.
ann
carrison
paschall
as
part
of
the
standard
warnings,
and
then
he
did--
ms.
ann
carrison
paschall
--not
in
so
many
words.
they
did
in
fact
get
him
a
lawyer
to
talk
to,
and
he
did
speak
with
the
attorney.
both
sides
offered
psychiatric
testimony,
and
i
think
the
kindest
thing
that
can
be
said
is,
there
were
two
psychiatrists
that
testified
for
the
defense.
one
testified
for
the
state.
they
couldn't
have
said
more
entirely
different
things.
they
went
into
great
detail
as
to
the
basis
for
their
opinions,
the
sorts
of
considerations
that
they
looked
at,
and
during
closing
arguments,
the
prosecutor
argued
that
officer
pilafont's
testimony
regarding
respondent's
exercise
of
his
miranda
rights,
the
whole
colloquy
from
the
time
he
met...
it
was
part
of
the
whole
description
of
greenfield's
behavior
from
the
time
officer
pilafont
encountered
him
on
the
beach
to
the
arrest
which
followed,
argued
this
whole
chain
of
behavior
as
evidence
that
the
jury
could
consider
tending
to
support
sanity.
the
defendant
objected
at
this
time,
and
the
objection
was
overruled
by
the
trial
court.
the
eleventh
circuit
ultimately
ordered
a
new
trial
in
this
cause,
stating
that
the
prosecutor...
the
use
of
respondent's
sanity
at
his
trial
violated
the
decision
of
this
court
in
doyle
versus
ohio.
in
so
doing,
they
brought
themselves
in
conflict
with
sulie
versus
duckworth,
the
seventh
circuit
case,
which
basically
said
that
doyle
did
not
apply
in
the
context
of
an
insanity
defense,
and
that
really
is
the
crucial
question
here,
and
the
distinction
the
state
draws
between
doyle
in
this
case.
in
doyle,
of
course,
this
court
held
that
a
respondent's
silence
following
the
miranda
warnings
was
insolubly
ambiguous,
that
it
should
not
be
used
to
suggest
to
the
jury
that...
i
think
the
inference
that
we
realize
juries
traditionally
make,
which
is,
if
this
defendant
were
innocent,
if
he
did
not
commit
this
crime,
well,
then
why
when
confronted
with
it
by
the
police
did
he
fail
to
make
a
statement?
doyle
prescribed
this
use
of
silence
after
the
miranda
warning
had
been
given.
our
argument
today
is
that
where,
as
in
this
case,
the
issue
is
not
whether
greenfield
committed
the
substantive
offense,
it
is
virtually
uncontroverted
that
he
committed
sexual
battery.
the
question
becomes
whether
he
should
be
held
accountable
for
his
conduct
at
the
time
of
that
offense
because
he
allegedly
did
not
know
right
from
wrong,
but
this
evidence
was
relevant
and
probative
on
the
sanity
question,
and
the
jury
had
a
right
to
consider
it.
ms.
ann
carrison
paschall
i
think
quite
probably
some
of
it
would
come
in
under
doyle.
the
problem
as
i
see
it
with
doyle
would
be
at
the
point
when
the
prosecutor
argues.
you
know,
he
spoke
to
an
attorney,
and
then
still
he
will
not
speak.
that
sort
of
testimony,
i
think,
in
the--
ms.
ann
carrison
paschall
--it
really
does.
ms.
ann
carrison
paschall
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
ann
carrison
paschall
he
asked
for
a
lawyer--
ms.
ann
carrison
paschall
--that
is
hardly
silence.
i
was...
and
it
is
a...
i
have
been
taken
to
task
sometimes
for
not
focusing
enough
on
the
silence.
i
think
you
have
to
look
in
the
record...
at
the
record
in
this
cause
and
realize
we
are
talking
about
a
whole
sequence
of
behavior,
a
whole
pilifont
met
greenfield
on
the
beach.
this
is
the
exchange
that
happened.
this
was
some
two
hours
after
the
offense,
when
one
of
the
defense
psychiatrists
says,
well,
that
is
part
of
why
i
can
tell
he
was
crazy.
he
would
have
run
from
the
police
officer
if
he
had
been
in
his
right
mind.
so,
two
hours
after
the
offense
we
are
looking
at
what
he
did,
what
he
said,
how
he
acted.
we
are
not
standing
up
here
and
saying,
oh,
my,
any
time
the
defendant
didn't
say
anything
at
all,
he
stood
absolutely
mute,
he
must
have
been
sane,
he
must
have
known
what
he
was
doing.
we
are
not
even
suggesting,
and
i
don't
think
we
have
to
suggest
this
evidence
is
conclusive
on
the
sanity
issue.
it
is
simply
one
factor
which
the
jury
had
a
right
to
consider
as
i
think
is
true
in
most
jurisdictions,
the
jury
has
the
right
to
disregard
expert
testimony,
to
give
it
whatever
weight
it
deems
is
appropriate.
in
this
case,
what
the
jury
thought
they
could
do
with
the
expert
testimony
after
they
heard
it,
we
have
defense
psychiatrists,
number
one,
who
says
this
defendant
was
insane
at
the
time
of
the
offense,
his
is
a
paranoid
schizophrenic,
but
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
that
he
is
an
antisocial
personality.
defense
psychiatrist
number
2
says
we
didn't
know
right
from
wrong
at
the
time
of
the
offense,
but
he
is
a
paranoid
schizophrenic,
and
he
is
an
antisocial
personality,
keeping
in
mind
the
first
psychiatrist
had
said
there
is
no
evidence
of
the
antisocial
personality,
the
state
psychiatrist
says,
he
knew
right
from
wrong
at
the
time
of
the
offense,
he
was
not
a
paranoid
schizophrenic,
there
is
no
evidence
of
that
in
the
record,
he
is
an
antisocial
personality.
the
two
conditions
are
totally
inconsistent,
and
each
psychiatrist
talks
about
the
basis
for
their
opinions
and
how
they
arrived
at
them.
dr.
luce
particularly
says,
well,
you
know,
i
spoke
with
him.
one
of
the
things
i
saw
was
his
loosened
associations.
he
didn't...
his
responses
to
my
questions
were
not
logical.
his
affect
was
flat.
this
is
some
two
months
after
the
offense.
the
jury,
having
had
benefit
of
the
psychiatrists
all
explaining
all
of
the
different
things
they
could
consider,
i
think,
could
properly
listen
to
the
testimony
as
to
the
exchange
that
took
place
between
pilifont
and
greenfield,
and
between
jolly
and
greenfield,
and
give
it
whatever
weight
they
thought
was
appropriate.
we
are
in
the
somewhat
unfortunate
situation
when
we
look
at
the
relevancy
question
because,
of
course,
there
was
no
objection
to
the
officer's
testimony
below.
the
testimony...
the
objection
that
was
registered
for
the
closing
argument
was
a
comment
on
silence.
we
never...
apparently
it
was
presumed,
if
you
will,
that
the
testimony
was
relevant.
the
second
district
says
it
was
certainly
relevant.
it
is
conceded
in
the
florida
appellate
briefs
that
the
testimony
was
relevant
on
the
sanity
issue.
ms.
ann
carrison
paschall
your
honor,
we
submit
that
that
is
part
of
the
reason
why
the
eleventh
circuit's
opinion
is
in
error.
their
justification,
as
i
understand
it,
was
that
doyle
said
silence
after
miranda
was
insolubly
ambiguous.
they
make
the
argument
that
this
evidence
was
ambiguous,
too,
so
there
is
no
reason...
part
of
their
justification
for
applying
doyle
under
these
facts.
ms.
ann
carrison
paschall
your
honor,
i
was
at
that
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals.
i
think
they
knew
what
they
were
reviewing.
they
reached
a
conclusion
that
was
contrary
to
what
i
had
argued
to
them,
but
i
think
we
were
all
aware
of
what
the
posture
of
the
case
was.
this
court
held
in
michigan
versus
tucker,
and
it
has
been
said
in
other
cases
since,
in
other
contexts,
that
it
is
sometimes
necessary
to
balance
a
defendant's
constitutional
rights
against
the
need
to
provide
probative
and
relevant
evidence
to
the
trier
of
fact.
we
would
submit
that
is
certainly
true
in
this
case.
ms.
ann
carrison
paschall
that
is
true.
ms.
ann
carrison
paschall
that
is
true.
of
course,
the
other
problem
that
we
have
is
that,
and
the
argument
that
we
have
continued
to
make,
that
since
there
was
no
argument,
no
objection
to
the
trial
testimony
of
these
officers,
that
it
was
proper
to
argue
that
testimony
in
closing
argument.
it
could
come
in
without
objection.
it
was
properly
before
the
court.
the
second
district
court
of
appeal
noted
that
there
had
been
no
objection
to
the
officer's
testimony.
we
have
contended
all
along
that
they
addressed
the
merits
of
this
case
basically
in
the
alternative,
giving
effect
to
the
procedural
question
as
well.
i
think
i
need
to
talk
very
briefly
at
least
about
the
wainwright
versus
sikes
issue
in
this
case.
there
has
been
some
question
raised
as
to
whether
we
are
properly
before
the
court
on
our
wainwright
v.
sikes
claim.
the
argument,
very
simply,
is,
the
court
of
appeals
on...
i
think
it
is
the
second
page
of
the
opinion,
footnote
1,
says
that
because
the
defendant
later
objected
20
times
to
the
prosecutor
arguing
the
officer's
testimony
as
to
silence,
we
can
excuse
the
failure
to
comply
with
the
contemporaneous
objection
rule.
we
submit
that...
well,
first
of
all,
the
record
is
in
error...
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
is
plainly
in
error
in
that
there
were
never
20
objections,
there
was
simply
one,
the
closing
argument.
since
they
chose
to
reach
that
issue
in
their
opinion
and
since
they
have
fashioned
for
us
a
rule
of
law
in
our
circuit
which
has
potential
ramifications
that
undermine
our
state
contemporaneous
objection
rule,
we
do
think
it
is
properly
before
the
court.
ms.
ann
carrison
paschall
we
argue
that,
and
i
guess
our
argument
in
response
to
that...
first,
to
answer
your
question,
yes,
if
the
state
court
addresses
it
on
the
merits
without
addressing
it
in
the
alternative,
it
would
cure
the
wainwright
v.
sikes
problem.
we
contend,
first
of
all,
that
the
second
district
addressed
the
merits
in
the
alternative
in
their
original
opinion.
it
went
up
to
the
florida
supreme
court
on
conflict,
our
own
conflict
certiorari.
the
supreme
court
sent
it
down,
back
to
the
second
district,
to
determine
whether
the
case
was
in
conflict
with
clark
versus
state.
now,
clark
is
basically
a
contemporaneous
objection
case.
it
says
that
if
you
do
not
object
to
a
comment
on
the
exercise
of
the
right
to
remain
silent
at
trial,
you
have
waived
it.
our
argument
is
that
since
they
sent
it
back
down
to
consider
in
light
of
a
contemporaneous
objection
case,
that
that
in
fact
is
what
the
second
district
was
saying,
is
yes,
we
are
consistent
with
clark,
we
have
given
effect
to
the
procedural
default
as
clark
did.
ms.
ann
carrison
paschall
yes,
they
did.
ms.
ann
carrison
paschall
yes.
ms.
ann
carrison
paschall
and
we
are
left
to
some
extent
with
speculation
on
precisely
what
the
motivation
was
there.
ms.
ann
carrison
paschall
the
reason--
ms.
ann
carrison
paschall
--the
reason
we
didn't
argue
wainwright
versus
sikes
was,
we
did
not
and
we
made
a
judgment
call
at
that
time.
we
did
want
to
play
the
emphasis
on
the
merits
of
the
opinion.
we
had
not
cross-appealed...
we
had
not
objected
to
the
magistrate's
report
and
recommendation
that
said
the
second
district
addressed
the
case
on
the
merits.
i
don't
think
we
had
to
object
to
the
magistrate's
report
and
recommendation.
we
didn't
cross-appeal
than
on
the
wainwright
v.
sikes
issue.
we
just
talked
about
the
merits
in
the
eleventh
circuit,
and
quite
frankly,
if
the
eleventh
circuit
hadn't
jumped
into
the
fray
and
chosen
to
address
that
issue
for
us,
i
don't
know
that
we
could
be
here
on
the
wainwright
v.
sikes
problem.
i
would
say
just
as
the
federal
courts
can
address
an
issue
on
the
merits
when
the
state
courts
don't
give
effect
to
their
procedural
default
rules
and
address
the
merits
of
the
claim,
here,
where
we
have
the
eleventh
circuit
claim,
we
are
talking
about
the
sikes
issue,
and
making
what
we
believe
is
an
erroneous
determination.
we
have
got
an
obligation
to
bring
it
before
this
court.
ms.
ann
carrison
paschall
yes,
he
did.
i
don't--
ms.
ann
carrison
paschall
--yes.
i
don't
know
that
the
magistrate
is
looking
at
a
florida
appellate
opinion
and
making...
and
saying
that
the
court
did
not
address...
that
the
court
addressed
the
merits
in
rejecting
our
alternative
holding.
i
don't
know
that
we
can
call
that
a
finding
of
fact
under
2254(d).
it
would
seem
to
be
something
that
each
court
can
simply
look...
you
know,
we
are
talking
about
an
appellate
opinion
here
rather
than
a
conclusion
that
was
drawn
after
a
hearing.
ms.
ann
carrison
paschall
that
is
frequently
true,
your
honor.
we
again...
our
argument
is
that
that
determination
is
incorrect
in
this
case.
i
believe
unless
there
are
additional
questions
at
this
time
i
would
like
to
save
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
ann
carrison
paschall
i
think
two
things.
the
first
thing
i
have
to
say
is
yes,
this
court's
decision
in
this
case
does...
would
make
a
difference,
looking
at
the
florida
supreme
court's
berwick
decision,
the
whole
opinion
is
fraught
with
analysis
of
the
federal
constitutional
issues.
there
is
almost
a
parenthetical
reference
at
the
end.
oh,
by
the
way,
it
violates
the
state
constitution,
too.
but
the
whole
analysis--
ms.
ann
carrison
paschall
--yes.
i
would
liken
the
effect...
in
south
dakota
versus
nevill
this
court
went
on
and
addressed
on
the
merits
the
issue
that
had
been
before
the
court
about
the
defendant's
refusal,
the
use
of
the
defendant's
refusal
to
take
a
blood
alcohol
test
even
though
the
south
dakota
court
had
also
said
that
it
violated
the
state
constitution.
this
court
in
a
footnote
notes
that
the
bulk
of
the
analysis
again
in
the
state
court
opinion
is
federal
constitutional
analysis,
that
that
is
what
had
been
addressed.
that
was
what
was
addressed
in
berwick.
and
further,
we
cannot
say
that
the
decision
in
berwick
would
be
such
a
change
of
law,
you
know,
even
if
as
to
necessarily
warrant
relief
at
some
later
date
for
mr.
greenfield.
for
one
thing,
it
might
clarify
the
procedural
default
question
once
and
for
all
if
the
state
courts
at
some
point
have
to
determine
whether
the
state
constitution
separately
from
the
federal
constitution
was
violated.
the
other
point
that
i
want
to
make
is,
we
just
can't
in
this
case
distinguish
the
evidence
that
came
in
of
demeanor,
of
the
yes,
i
want
an
attorney,
no,
i
don't
want
to
talk
to
you.
we
can't
say,
well,
some
of
this
is
admissible,
it
is
fine,
it
is
demeanor
evidence,
but
the
part
which
goes
to
silence
is
wrong,
it
shouldn't
have
been
admitted.
i
think
if
one
looks
at
the
eleventh
circuit's
opinion
that
justice
rehnquist
has
been
talking
about
today
where
they
set
out
the
quote
at
pages
a9
and
10
of
the
appendix
to
the
cert
petition,
it
is
a
lengthy
quote.
in
that
whole
section
of
the
prosecutor's
argument,
the
only
portions
of
it
that
go
to
silence,
there
is
a
good
portion
of
the
argument,
i
do
not
want
to
speak
to
you,
and
then
at
the
end
of
the
argument,
do
you
want
to
talk,
no.
and
again,
he
talked
to
the
attorney,
again
he
will
not
speak.
in
that
whole
argument,
those
are
the
only
references
to
silence.
in
fact,
the
whole
argument
gets
to
that
very
point
before
there
is
ever
any
objection
raised
to
the
argument
in
the
trial
court.
the
eleventh
circuit
in
finding
that
the
error
in
this
case
was
not
harmless
said
it
wasn't
harmless
because
the
prosecutor's
argument
was
such
a
major
portion
of
the
argument.
i
don't
think
that
one
can
say
if
the
court
had
been
considering
only
the
very
brief
references
to
silence,
how
that
could
not
have
been
harmless
error
in
the
light
of
the
testimony
of
officers,
pilifont
and
jolly,
in
light
of
the
thrust
of
the
entire
argument.
i
think
it
is
a
reasonable
conclusion
that
that
is
what
the
eleventh
circuit
was
going
to.
they
were
attacking
the
whole
line
of
argument
that
was
made.
in
short,
we
would
ask
this
court
to
hold
that
where
the
only
issue
is
a
defendant's
criminal
responsibility
at
the
time
of
the
defense,
that
this
post-miranda
behavior,
including
silence,
can
be
used
against
him.
we
would
ask
that
you
reverse
the
decision
of
the
eleventh
circuit.
ms.
ann
carrison
paschall
your
honor,
i
am
not...
of
course,
those
facts
are
somewhat
different
from
these.
i
think
then
you
would
get
into
a
difficult
question
with...
it
the
purpose
of
miranda--
ms.
ann
carrison
paschall
--i
am
not
sure
that...
if
i
would
draw
a
distinction,
i
would
note
that
we
certainly
still
have
an
attempt
to
abide
by
the
miranda
decision,
and
whatever
deterrent
effect
miranda
has
on
police
misconduct,
and
excluding
that
type
of
evidence
when
the
police
have
violated
miranda
might
or
might
not
be
appropriate.
ms.
ann
carrison
paschall
it
is
not
a
distinction
i
am
prepared
to
make.
thank
you
very
much.
