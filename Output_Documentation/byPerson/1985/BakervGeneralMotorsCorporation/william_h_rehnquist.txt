justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
that
a
construction
of
the
michigan
law
or
a
description
of
what
congress
had
permitted?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
in
order
to
make
it
a
proper
part
of
the
federal
question
that
you
have
brought
here,
you
have
to
show
that
congress'
tolerance
of
them,
or
whatever
you
want
to
say,
would
depend
to
some
extent
on
their
voluntariness.
the
fact
that
it
may
be
an
incorrect
finding
of
fact
under
michigan
law
as
to
voluntariness
certainly
wouldn't
be
something
we
would
review.
