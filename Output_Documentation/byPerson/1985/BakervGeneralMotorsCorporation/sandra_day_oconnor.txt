mr.
rossen,
did
any
workers
refuse
to
pay
the
increased
dues?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
would
the
union
do
with
a
member
who
refused
to
pay
the
increased
dues
for
the
purposes
of
financing
the
strike?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
concede
that
the
state
can
disqualify
non-strikers
who
finance
a
strike
by
means
of
payments
other
than
in
the
form
of
union
dues?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
on
its
face.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
on
its
face
you
mean.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
concede
then
that
it
can
apply
if
it
is
payment
other
than
union
dues?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
nash,
could
the
state
treat
the
payment
of
regular
union
dues
as
financing
the
strike?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
know
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
in
your
view,
i
take
it
any
local
strike
supported
by
a
national
union
strike
fund
that
leads
to
some
lay-offs
of
non-strikers
will
justify
denying
the
benefits
to
the
non-strikers.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
maybe
the
question
is
whether
congress
authorized
that
result.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
the
evidence
that
leads
you
to
think
that
congress
intended
to
go
so
far
as
the
circumstances
i
have
described
with
regular
dues?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
were
the
strikes
here
at
the
foundry
plants
over
purely
local
issues?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
because
the
national
issue
had
already
been
resolved.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
the
non-striking
workers
we
are
concerned
about
really
didn't
have
any
interest
in
those
local
issues,
i
take
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
cohen,
do
you
think
it
makes
any
difference
whether
the
non-striking
workers
have
a
direct
interest
in
the
issues
of
local
strikes?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
you
would
employ
a
foreseeability
statement?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and,
did
congress
care
whether
it
was
foreseeable?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
payment
of
regular
dues
could
be
financing
in
congress'
view?
