justice

white
they
are
withholding
some
state
benefits,
i
suppose,
that
they
would
otherwise
have
been
qualified
for.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
that
burdens
their
section
7
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
employers
can
walk
strikers
out
to.
that
burdens
their
right
to
strike
pretty
much.
justice
byron
r.
white
without
committing
an
unfair
labor
practice
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
wouldn't
think
the
strikers...
that
the
state
must
pay
unemployment
benefits
to
strikers.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
burdening
section
7
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
may
the
state
do
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
either
grant
or
deny
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
the
strikers'
claims
when
they
are
strikers...
the
claim
still
is
that
their
section
7
rights
are
being
burdened
by
a
refusal
to
pay
unemployment
benefits,
just
like
the
claim
is
here
that
these
people
who
finance
strikes
are
exercising
their
section
7
rights.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
did
these
people
lose
their
jobs?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
weren't
out
of
their
jobs
because
they
were
on
strike.
they
were
out
of
their
jobs
for
another
reason.
justice
byron
r.
white
when
members
strike
and
a
state
denies
unemployment
compensation,
there
is
the
same
burden,
i
suppose,
on
section
7
rights.
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
the
reason
it
isn't
an
unfair
labor
practice
or
the
reason
it
isn't
preempted
is
because
of
the
neutrality
argument,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
call
it
in
this
case?
whatever
it
is
it
is
the
same--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
you
are
interfering
here
at
least
with
your
right
to
contribute
to
the
support
of
a
union.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
these
people
lose
their
jobs
on
account
of
the
strike?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
no
question
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
if
the
foundry
workers
had
struck
and
then
the
employer
locked
everybody
out,
what
about
the
people
who
didn't
strike
but
who
were
locked
out,
but
who
had
been
contributing
to
the
union?
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
all
they
did
though,
instead
of
locking
out,
they
laid
them
off.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
the
strike.
well,
because
there
was
a
strike.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
it
have
been
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
the
employer
to
fire
these
people
for
having
paid
the
special
dues?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
i
think
so.
that
is
a
section
7
to
pay
those
dues
and
the
employer
could
not
fire
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
i
suppose
if
he
had
fired
them
for
paying
the
dues
while
the
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
was
going
on,
these
people
wanted
unemployment
benefits,
they
would
have
got
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
other
hand,
they
were
contributing
to
the
strike
fund
and
you
can't
say
that
they
didn't
contribute
to
their
own
unemployment.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
were
fired
because
they
contributed.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
anyway,
it
is
a
tough
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
payment
of
benefits
didn't
involve
the
interference
with
any
protected
rights
i
gather.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
yes.
but,
nevertheless,
the
argument
against
paying
them
was
that
the
state
shouldn't
upset
this
balance.
that
is
the
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
can
pay
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
couldn't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
think
the
policy
of
so-called
neutrality
is
pretty
strong?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
state
just
denies
payments
to
strikers
from
the
very
first
day?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
certainly
reads
on
section
7
rights.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
can
they
do
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
of
this
strong
policy
of
neutrality.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
where
was
the
evidence
found
in
new
york,
both
in
the
nlra
and
the
social
security
act?
