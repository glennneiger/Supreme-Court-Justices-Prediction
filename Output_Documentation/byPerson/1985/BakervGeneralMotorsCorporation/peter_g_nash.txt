mr.
peter
g.
nash
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
briefly
run
over
the
facts
again
quickly
in
this
case
to
put
them
in
perspective
from
general
motors'
point
of
view.
here
a
special
strike
fund
assessment
or
special
dues
was
made
of
uaw
members,
payments
to
be
made
in
october
and
were
made
in
october
and
november
of
1967,
increasing
each
member
of
the
union's
dues
payments
into
that
strike
fund
from
$1.25
a
month
to
from
$10
to
$20
a
month
for
a
total
increased
payments
by
these
individuals
of
from
$20
to
$40
in
this
case.
these
specials
dues
were
made
in
anticipation
of
strikes
in
the
auto
industry,
including
anticipation
of
either
national
or
local
strikes
at
general
motors
plants
and
funds
were
being
contributed
to
a
special
strike
fund
which
would
pay
benefits
not
only
to
strikers
but
also
to
uaw
members
who
might
ultimately
be
laid
of
as
a
result
of
those
strikes
who
did
not
receive
unemployment
compensation
benefits
from
the
states
in
which
they
were
laid
off.
the
benefits
in
this
fund
are
paid
not
only
to
strikers
but
also
to
those
who
are
laid
off
as
a
result
if
they
don't
get
unemployment
compensation
benefits.
in
january
and
february
of
1968,
what
was
anticipated,
indeed,
came
to
pass.
three
general
motors
foundaries
went
out
on
strike
and
as
a
result
of
a
lack
of
products,
parts,
being
made
by
those
foundries
a
number
of
employees,
including
all
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
were
laid
off
at
other
gm
plants
because
of
the
strike
of
their
gm
brethern
in
those
three
foundries.
they
were
denied...
in
this
case,
the
plaintiffs
were
denied
unemployment
compensation
benefits
in
the
state
of
michigan
because
they
had
financed
a
strike
which
had
resulted
in
their
unemployment.
the
financing
arrangement
those
these
special
dues
payments
were,
as
found
by
the
michigan
supreme
court,
or
did,
as
found
by
the
michigan
supreme
court,
have
a
meaningful
connection
with
the
unemployment
which
resulted
from
the
strike
and
as
a
consequence
they
were
denied
unemployment
compensation.
one
further
fact--
mr.
peter
g.
nash
--that
is
not
the
case
we
have
here.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
that
is
a
tougher
case,
but
i
think
analytically
and
at
least
arguably,
yes,
they
could.
and,
indeed,
i
think
there
are
37
states
whose
statutes
do,
in
fact,
treat
the
payment
of
regular
union
dues
as
a
disqualification
for
unemployment
compensation
benefits.
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
for
that,
i
think,
and
the
reasons
for
that
primarily,
however,
i
believe,
come
from
this
court's
analysis
of
the
unemployment
compensation
system
and
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
new
york
telephone.
this
court,
at
least
as
i
read
the
decision
of
all
of
the
justices
in
new
york
telephone,
determined
that
congress,
when
it
enacted
the
national
labor
relations
act,
intended
to
leave
the
parties
in
a
neutral
position,
management
and
labor,
each
to
bear
the
full
economic
consequences
of
a
strike.
employees
wouldn't
be
paid
wages
and
the
employer
wouldn't
be
able
to
run
his
business
and
would
lose
money.
each
side
would
bear
the
full
economic
consequences.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
whether
it
justifies
it
or
not,
in
terms
of
how
the
state
interprets
its
unemployment
compensation
statute
is
one
matter.
the
question
before
this
court
is
does
the
constitution,
does
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
the
social
security
act
allow
the
states
to
so
act.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
yes.
i
believe
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes,
that
congress
authorized
that,
not
only
in
terms
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
the
balance
of
power
struck,
but
more
particularly--
mr.
peter
g.
nash
--as
i
say,
that
is
a
tougher
case
than
ours.
but,
as
i
see
it,
what
congress
intended
and
what
this
court
found
that
congress
intended
when
it
passed
the
national
labor
relations
act
was
that
each
party
bore
the
economic
consequences
of
that
and
that
a
state
interferes
with
and
is
preempted
in
its
actions
by
the
national
labor
relations
act
if
it,
in
fact,
shifts
that
economic
burden
or
changes
that
economic
burden
in
either
one
of
two
ways.
either
it
requires
the
employer
to
pay
more,
it
costs
the
employer
more
to
take
a
strike,
or
if
what
the
state
is
doing
cushions
the
impact
of
that
strike
upon
employees.
in
new
york
telephone,
this
court,
as
i
read
the
decisions,
said
that
absent
the
social
security
act,
payment
of
benefits
to
strikers,
unemployment
benefits,
would
be
preempted
by
the
national
labor
relations
act
because
it
does
both
those
things.
employers
contribute
to
an
unemployment
compensation
fund.
if
that
money
is
paid
to
the
strikers,
it
not
only
cushions
the
impact
of
that
strike
on
those
strikers,
but
also
costs
the
employer
an
awful
lot
more
to
take
that
strike.
the
same
is
true
in
this
particular
case.
if
an
employer
is
required
to
pay
benefits...
employer
to
the
state
unemployment
compensation
fund...
is
required
to
pay
benefits
to
those
laid
off
as
a
natural
consequence
of
a
strike,
laid
off
in
another
plant,
it
costs
the
employer
more
to
take
that
strike
because
it
has
to
pay
benefits
to
everybody
that
is
laid
off
as
a
result
of
that
strike.
and,
particularly
in
this
case,
where
the
strike
fund
pays
benefits
not
only
to
strikers,
but
also
to
those
laid
off
as
the
result
of
a
strike,
unless
those
latter
people
receive
unemployment
compensation
benefits...
if
the
state
of
michigan
paid
unemployment
compensation
benefits
to
employees
in
this
case
who
financed
the
strike,
the
employer
would
have
to
pay
for
all
of
that.
and,
in
addition,
the
strike
fund
would
not
diluted
by
that,
thus
giving
additional
economic
power
to
all
the
people
on
strike
because
their
strike
is
going
to
be
bigger,
bigger
benefits
could
be
paid
over
a
longer
period
of
time.
so
that
the
payment
of
benefits
in
this
case
has
the
same
effect
of
conflicting
with
policies
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
did
the
payment
of
strike
benefits
or
benefits
to
strikers
in
the
new
york
telephone
case.
the
court
held
in
this
case,
however,
that
that
conflict
with
the
national
labor
relations
act
is
allowed
and
was
intended
to
be
allowed
by
congress
because
congress
passed
the
social
security
act
which
granted
to
the
states
broad
powers
to
structure
their
social
security
systems
the
way
they
wanted
to
structure
them.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
i
don't
know
that,
but
i
am
assuming
that
they
were,
yes.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
that
is
correct,
although
that
is
not
necessarily
true
in
local
strikes
and
it
was
not
true
in
later...
or
at
least
from
gm's
perspective
it
was
not
true
in
later
strikes
at
local
plants.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
that
is
correct
in
this
sense.
well,
they
had
an
interest
in
the
strike
to
the
extent
that
any
time
their
brethern
are
able
to
mount
a
strike
they
have
more
solidarity
and
they
are
able
to
improve
benefits
for
them.
they
did
not
have
a
direct
interest
in
the
strike.
indeed,
had
they
had
a
direct
interest,
we
wouldn't
be
here
on
this
issue
today
because
the
michigan
statute
says
that
employees
are
disqualified
from
unemployment
compensation
benefits
if
they
are
laid
off
as
a
result
of
a
strike
in
which
they
have
a
direct
interest.
so,
presumably
they
would
have
been
denied
benefits
on
that
basis
rather
than
on
the
basis
of
having
financed
the
strike.
but,
the
impact
on
the
economic...
the
economic
impact
is
the
same.
the
balance
in
this
case
is
tipped
against
the
employer
and
in
favor
of
the
employees
exactly
the
same
as
it
was
in
new
york
telephone.
to
reiterate,
this
court,
however,
found
that
even
though
that
conflicted
in
new
york
telephone
with
the
national
labor
relations
act
the
state
was
allowed
to
engage
in
that
kind
of
conflict
because
congress
had
passed
the
social
security
act
giving
the
states
broad
power
to
structure
their
own
unemployment
compensation
system
the
way
they
wanted
to.
and,
as
a
consequence
of
that,
even
though
those
payments
in
that
case
interfered
with
the
strong
policy
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
for
a
state
to
remain
neutral,
it
was
okay
for
the
states
to
do
it
because
congress
had
given
the
states
the
right
to
make
those
calls
and
structure
their
own
system.
that
is
the
way
we
come
at
this
case
looking
at
new
york
telephone.
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
come
at
it
differently.
they
say
that
here
the
employer
has
interfered
with
a
section
7
right
of
employees
to
finance
a
strike,
that
is
a
section
7
right,
and
as
a
consequence
you
have
got
basically
a
garmon
preemption
case
that
a
state
can't
act
in
such
a
way
as
to
interfere
with
a
section
7
right.
first
of
all,
we
don't
see
that
the
inteference
with
a
section
7
right
is
equivocal
at
all.
indeed,
in
new
york
telephone,
as
mr.
justice
white
pointed
out
before
the
break,
in
new
york
telephone
the
state
had
it
denied
unemployment
compensation
benefits,
as
every
member
of
this
court
said
they
could
have,
would
have
interfered
with
the
section
7
right
to
strike.
indeed,
that
right
is
to
important
that
congress
went
to
all
the
trouble
to
pass
section
13
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
to
restate
once
again
that
that
was
a
protected
right,
something
it
has
not
done
with
the
financing
of
a
strike.
so,
the
fact
that
it
interferes
with
a
section
7
right
should
not
make
a
difference.
and,
in
this
particular
case,
the
section
7
allegedly
interfered
with
the
right
to
finance
a
strike
or
finance
a
union...
paying
unemployment
benefits
to
those
people
has
the
same
economic
impact,
i.e.,
the
shifting
of
the
balance
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
the
state
ought
to
be
able
to
do
it.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
that
is
correct.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
correct.
i
don't
know
that
you
can
really
call
it
so
much
an
interference
with
a
section
7
right,
i
prefer
to
look
at
it
that
if
there
is
a
strike--
mr.
peter
g.
nash
--you
bear
the
economic
consequences
of
your
actions.
when
you
strike
and
go
out,
yes,
i
guess
one
might
say
and
probably
you
would
say
by
not
paying
them
unemployment
compensation
benefits,
you
have
interfered
with
their
right
to
strike,
but
you
really
haven't.
what
you
have
really
done--
mr.
peter
g.
nash
--that
is
correct,
but
that
is
all
part
and
parcel
of
the
union
bearing
the
natural
economic
consequences
of
the
strike.
in
fact,
when
the
employees
go
out
on
strike,
and
in
this
case
it
is
a
very
carefully
drawn
issue,
here
employees
of
general
motors
went
out
on
strike
and
the
state
supreme
court
found
that,
in
fact,
the
employees
who
were
laid
off
and
denied
benefits
here
significantly
contributed
to
their
unemployment
because
they
contributed
to
a
strike
fund
which
supported
those
people
who
went
out
on
strike.
that
also
comes
close
to
what...
or
is
consistent
with
what
the
social
security
act
intended
when
it
said
to
the
states,
pass
your
own
unemployment
compensation
systems.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
yes.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
no
question.
they
were
laid
off
because
the
foundries
were
struck
by
their
fellow
uaw
members
in
a
strike
which
they
helped
to
finance
by
paying
these
special
dues
to
a
strike
fund
and
they
were
laid
off
because
the
parts
coming
out
of
the
foundries
weren't
coming
any
more
because
of
the
strike
and
there
wasn't
enough
work
for
them
in
their
plants.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
the
state
of
michigan,
under
its
unemployment
compensation
statute,
says
that
if
an
employer
locks
out
employees
that
does
not
disqualify
them
from
unemployment
comp.--
so,
in
this
case,
they
would
have
been
paid
their
unemployment
compensation
had
the
employer
locked
them
out,
even
though
that
interferes
with
the
employer's
ability
to
lock
out.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
they
laid
them
off
as
a
result
of
no
work.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
that
is
correct.
but,
a
lock-out,
i
think,
really
is
normally
defined
by
courts,
labor
board,
and
arbitrators
as
an
act
by
an
employer
seeking
to
put
pressure
on
a
union
to
get
the
union
to
concede
to
the
employer's
position.
here,
the
employer
wasn't
putting
any
pressure
on
anybody.
he
just
didn't
have
work
and
laid
these
people
off
and
whether
the
union
in
that
plant
ever
conceded
to
his
position
on
anything
was
irrelevant.
the
people
would
come
back
to
work
as
soon
as
there
was
work
for
them.
it
really
is
not
in
the
context
of
a
lock-out
as
this
court
looked
at
in
american
ship
and
brown.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
well,
in
this
particular
case
they
would
not
have
lost
their
job.
there
was
no--
mr.
peter
g.
nash
--they
might
have
lost
their
union
membership.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
the
uaw's
constitution?
mr.
peter
g.
nash
i
am
not
an
expert
on
the
uaw's
constitution,
but
i
would
assume,
yes,
they
could
have
lost
their
membership.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
no.
i
don't
know
whether
it
is
voluntary
or
not,
but
i
don't
know
that
that
is
relevant.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
no,
i
don't
need
it
to
be
voluntary
and
if
i
said
that
i
spoke
too
fast.
no,
it
doesn't
have
to
be
voluntary,
the
payment
of
these
special
dues.
in
fact,
they
aren't
being
denied
unemployment
compensation
benefits
in
this
case
because
they
paid
emergency
dues,
because
they
exercised
a
section
7
right.
what
the
state
of
michigan
held
was
they
are
being
denied
unemployment
compensation
benefits
because
they
contributed
to
their
own
unemployment.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
they
contributed
to
their
own
unemployment.
that
is
the
key
to
the
state
of
michigan.
whether
that
is
a
section
7
right
or
not
is
really
irrelevant.
and
that
really
is
the
key--
mr.
peter
g.
nash
--well,
it
may
be
semantics
in
this
court.
it
was
not
semantics
in
the
state
of
michigan.
the
state
of
michigan
determined
that
employees
shall,
in
fact,
be
paid
unemployment
compensation
benefits
unless
they
contribute
in
some
way
to
their
own
unemployment.
if
they
quit,
they
are
fired
for
cause,
a
whole
bunch
of
ways
in
which
a
person
contributes
to
his
or
her
own
unemployment
and,
thus,
is
denied
benefits.
had
they
gone
out
on
strike,
they
would
have
contributed
obviously
to
their
own
unemployment.
financing
a
strike
which
resulted
in
their
lay
off
in
view
of
the
state
of
michigan,
and
i
think
correctly
so
in
the
interpretation
of
its
statute,
constitutes
a
contribution
by
the
employee
to
his
own
unemployment
and
results
in
a
denial
of
unemployment
benefits.
these
people
then
are
eligible
to
receive
benefits
under
the
uaw
strike
fund
at
least
indirectly
from
the
uaw
and
its
members
to
the
employer,
general
motors
in
this
case.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
correct.
but,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
doesn't
get
us
very
far
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
state
program
which
is
intended
to
provide
benefits
to
people
who
don't
contribute
to
their
own
unemployment
has
to
provide
benefits
to
people
who,
in
fact,
contribute.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
i
don't
know
what
the
answer
to
that
case
is.
they
probably
would
have
because
there
they
would
have
been
unemployed
as
a
result
of
being
fired
rather
than
as
a
result
of
a
strike,
so
i
guess--
mr.
peter
g.
nash
--well,
except
that
if
you
say
the
reason
they
are
now
unemployed
is
because
they
were
fired
rather
than
because--
mr.
peter
g.
nash
--i--
mr.
peter
g.
nash
--that
is
a
tough
case
and
this
is
not
our
case,
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
in
that
circumstance
they
were
fired
illegally
and,
therefore,
they
probably
would
get
the
unemployment
benefits
and
they
certainly
would
be
eligible
for
back
pay
in
a
national
labor
relations
board
proceeding
if
they
then
made
an
offer
to
return
to
work.
this
case,
however,
is...
and
i
would
like
to
stress
at
this
point...
not
a
question...
doesn't
present
the
question
which
i
think
jordan
was
really
talking
about
earlier
of
whether
the
state
of
michigan
correctly
interpreted
its
statute,
whether
it
went
off
on
some
whimsy,
whether
or
not
the
way
the
state
of
michigan
interpreted
its
statute
is
inconsistent
with
the
way
the
state
of
illinois
interpreted
its
statute.
the
whole
question
in
this
case
is
is
the
state
of
michigan
free
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
to
make
the
interpretation
it
made?
does
that
conflict
with
an
act
of
congress
and
we
submit
it
does
not
conflict,
indeed,
it
is
consistent
with
the
national
labor
relations
act.
it
certainly
is
consistent
with
what
the
social
security
act,
in
fact,
allows
the
states
to
do
and
under
those
circumstances
there
is
no
basis
for
saying
that
this
act
is
preempted
by
the
national
labor
relations
act.
congress
has
told
the
states
you
can
do
this
kind
of
thing
in
structuring
your
own
unemployment
compensation
system.
this
court
has
found
that
in
the
new
york
telephone
case,
and,
as
a
consequence,
whether
michigan
was
right
or
wrong
in
the
way
they
interpreted
its
statute,
it
has
the
constitutional
right
to
be
either
right
or
wrong,
and
that
is
not
the
issue.
the
issue
is
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
the
social
security
act
allow
the
state
of
michigan
to
do
what
they
did
and
the
answer
to
that
we
submit
is
clearly
yes.
