mr.
louis
r.
cohen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
is
a
strong
national
labor
policy
reiterated
by
this
court
only
yesterday
against
state
interference
with
the
collective
bargaining
process
in
a
way
that
alters
the
economic
balance
between
labor
and
management.
one
way
to
view
this
case
is
that
it
presents
the
question
whether
a
state
is
permitted
to
honor
that
federal
policy
and
deny
unemployment
compensation
to
employees
who
the
state
found
had
paid
extraordinary
emergency
dues
that
foreseeably
went
to
support
a
strike
that
foreseeably
caused
their
own
unemployment
or
whether,
as
appellant
suggests,
the
state
is
required
to
pay
benefits
because
the
financing
activities
are
protected
by
section
7
because
they
are
labelled
dues.
the
government,
including
the
national
labor
relations
board,
believes
that
congress
meant
to
leave
the
states
free
to
deny
benefits
in
this
situation.
we
think
new
york
telephone
clearly
suggests
that
answer.
there,
after
considering
the
legislative
history,
the
court
ruled
that
states
were
free
to
deny
benefits
to
persons
engaged
in
the
quintessential
section
7
activity,
striking.
there
are,
i
think,
only
two
distinctions
between
new
york
telephone
and
this
case.
first,
new
york
telephone
involved
the
question
whether
the
state
could
pay
benefits.
this
case
involves
what
i
think
every
member
of
the
new
york
telephone
court
would
have
thought
was
the
easier
question,
whether
the
state
can
deny
benefits.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
the
payment
did
not.
the
denial
of
benefits,
justice
white,
would
have
burdened
the
exercise
of
a
section
7
right
to
strike
and
yet
i
think
it
was
an
assumption
and
appellants
have
conceded
here
today
that
the
state
was
at
least
at
liberty
to
deny
benefits
in
that
situation.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
yes.
we
think
that
the
same
argument
is
applicable
here
to
the
payment
of
benefits
to
people
who
were
found
by
the
state
to
have
been
as
closely
allied
to
the
actual
strikers
as
these
appellants
were.
we
think,
indeed,
that
either
the
legislative
history
nor
the
logic
of
new
york
telephone
suggests
any
distinction.
i
want,
first
of
all,
to
stress
that
appellants
are
just
wrong
when
they
imply
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
wagner
act
and
the
social
security
act
in
1935
distinguishes
in
some
way
between
actual
strikers
and
people
who
finance
a
strike
that
leads
to
their
own
unemployment.
there
is
no
such
distinction.
there
were,
as
the
court
noted
in
new
york
telephone,
five
state
unemployment
compensation
statutes
that
predated
the
wagner
act.
none
of
those
statutes
had
a
special
category
for
actual
strikers.
all
of
those
statutes
disqualified,
or
in
the
case
of
new
york,
delayed
payments
to
a
class
of
people
consisting
of
everyone
who
was
put
out
of
work
because
of
a
strike,
strikers,
financiers,
and
innocent
bystanders.
the
draft
statutes
that
were
submitted
to
congress
while
it
was
considering
the
social
security
act
contained
a
similarly
broad
disqualification
and
when
congress
acting
as
the
district
of
columbia
legislature
adopted
an
unemployment
compensation
statute
for
the
district
of
columbia
in
1936,
it
disqualified
such
a
broad
class
of
people.
nor
was
there
any
distinction
between
strikers
and
financiers
in
the
sample
statute
promulgated
by
the
social
security
board
in
january
of
1936.
the
social
security
board,
the
agency
created
by
the
act,
disqualified
persons
participating
in,
financing
or
directly
interested
in
the
strike
that
caused
their
unemployment.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
i
think
that
michigan
was
entitled
to
decide,
as
its
legislature
and
its
courts
have,
that
non-striking
workers
who
pay
extraordinary
dues
that
can
be
expected
to
finance
other
people's
local
strikes
under
circumstances
where
it
is
foreseeable
that
that
will
cause
lay-offs
in
their
own
plants,
michigan
is
entitled
to
disqualify
those
people.
that
is
the
basis.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
well,
i
think
the
state
of
michigan
employed
a
foreseeability
standard.
i
think
that
congress
permitted
them
to
do
that.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
well,
i
think
that
congress
should
be
assumed
to
have
cared
about
the
policy
of
non-state
intervention
in
a
labor
dispute
that
is
going
on.
and,
i
think
what
michigan
did
here
was
to
find
that
these
employees
were
sufficiently
directly
involved
with
the
labor
dispute
that
was
going
on,
that
payment
of
benefits
to
them
could
constitute
intervention
which
they
were
entitled
not
to
do.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
i
want
to
agree
with
mr.
nash
that
that
is
not
this
case,
disagree
with
him
to
the
extent
of
saying
i
think
probably
not.
i
think
that
the
rationale
that
the...
the
purpose
of
congress
in
the
two
statutes
was
to
permit
the
states
to
decide
what
they
wished
to
do
in
this
specific...
on
the
specific
question
of
providing
assistance
in
the
context
of
a
labor
dispute
does
not
extend
to
a
disqualification
because
of
the
payment
of
regular
dues.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
well,
i
think
as
usual
there
is
a
grey
area.
i
think
michigan
worked
for
20
years
to
draw
the
line
and
it
drew
a
correct
one.
i
think
there
is
a
distinction
between
a
decision
not
to
finance
people
who
are
directly
involved
in
a
particular
labor
dispute
to
the
extent
that
these
were...
and
a
decision
to
deny
benefits
to
people
who
are
union
members
or
have
paid
regular
dues
because
it
happened
that
some
of
those
dues
found
their
way
into
the
hands
of
strikers.
michigan
was
careful
not
to
do
that.
i
wanted
to
say
a
word
about
the
question
of
whether
this
action
was
voluntary.
i
think
it
is
clear
that
among
other
things
this
court's
decision
in
the
hodory
case
and
all
of
the
legislative
history
that
i
have
recited
that
voluntariness
is
not
a
requirement
of
the
federal
statute;
that
is
a
state
is
not
required
to
find
that
a
worker
is
voluntarily
unemployed
before
it
may
disqualify
him.
i
also
think
that
voluntariness
is
an
illusive
notion
in
the
context
of
what
are
inherently
collective
activities
in
which
individuals
may
feel
subject
to
varying
pressures.
for
example,
the
decision
by
an
individual
not
to
participate
in
a
strike
could
well
be
a
violation
of
union
rules
subjecting
him
to
some
sort
of
discipline,
but
would...
but,
it
is
nevertheless
clear,
i
think,
that
states
may
deny
benefits
to
people
engaged
in
the
voluntary
activity
of
striking.
thank
you.
