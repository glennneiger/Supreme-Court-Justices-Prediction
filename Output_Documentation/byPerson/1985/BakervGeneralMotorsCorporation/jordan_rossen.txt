mr.
jordan
rossen
thank
you,
mr.
chief,
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
appellants
are
non-striking
general
motors
employees
who
were
laid
off
due
to
strikes
elsewhere.
it
is
agreed
that
the
only
basis
for
the
labor
dispute
disqualification
in
this
case
was
because
they
pay
emergency
dues.
the
issue
is
may
a
state
deny
unemployment
compensation
to
these
appellants
solely
because
they
paid
emergency
or
increased
dues
lawfully
required
as
a
condition
of
remaining
union
members
where
the
dues
were
for
the
union
strike
fund
from
which
strikers
later
receive
strike
benefits.
appellant's
union
had
a
convention
in
october
and
voted
to
require
as
a
condition
of
membership
emergency
dues
of
all
uaw
members
in
the
united
states
and
canada.
and,
it
is
agreed
and
stipulated
that
these
appellants
paid
$20
to
$40
each
for
the
months
of
october
and
november,
1967
to
their
own
local
unions
which
then
sent
the
increase
or
emergency
dues
to
the
international
union's
strike
fund.
appellants
continued
working
at
their
own
plants.
their
local
union
settled
their
contract
which
appellants
ratified.
that
year
there
was
no
national
strike
at
general
motors
corporation.
instead,
the
general
motors
agreement
was
settled
in
december
and
ratified
by
the
union
members.
in
late
january,
three
general
motors
foundry
locals
went
on
strike
over
local
issues
and
after
those
11
to
12-day
strikes
ended,
they
received
no
more
than
$18
from
the
international
union's
strike
fund.
those
foundry
strikes
caused
part
shortages
and
resulted
in
layoffs
at
appellant's
plant.
appellants
were
comparatively
few
members
at
each
plant
who
were
selected
because
they
had
low
seniority
and
they
were
laid
off
from
those
plants
by
general
motors
and
they
applied
for
unemployment
compensation
for
that
february,
three
months
after
they
paid
those
dues.
they
were
found
eligible
under
state
law
in
the
sense
that
they
had
worked
long
enough
to
earn
their
compensation,
they
had
enough
credit
weeks,
they
were
available
for
work,
they
were
seeking
work,
they
wanted
to
continue
working,
and
they
were
involuntarily
unemployed.
the
labor
dispute
disqualification
was
asserted
as
a
reason
for
denying
them
compensation
and
under
all
aspects
or
all
parts
of
the
michigan
labor
dispute
statute,
they
were
not
disqualified
except
one.
what
we
mean
by
that
is
they
were
held
by
all
agencies
and
courts
to
not
be
in
the
same
locations
as
the
strikers,
they
were
not
participating
in
any
foundry
strikes,
they
were
not
interested
in
them
in
the
sense
that
they
could
not
benefit
from
them
nor
could
they
influence
those
negotiations
or
strikes.
they
were
disqualified
because
they
had
financed
the
labor
dispute
as
held
by
the
michigan
court
because
they
had
paid
those
increased
or
emergency
dues
the
previous
october.
if
possible,
we
would
like
to
get
into
our
argument
a
little
bit
and
then
try
to
respond
to
some
of
the
points
made
by
general
motors.
it
is
pretty
well
agreed
that
appellants
would
not
have
been
disqualified
from
their
unemployment
compensation
but
for
the
facts
that
they
chose
to
remain
union
members
and
paid
these
increased
or
emergency
dues.
the
michigan
supreme
court
correctly
held
that
this
conflicts
with
their
section
7
right
to
assist
their
union
and
it
also
conflicts
with
their
right
to
join
and
remain
union
members
if
they
choose
to
do
so.
under
this
court's
ordinary
preemption
rules,
state
action
which
conflicts
with
such
section
7
rights
would
be
preempted,
wouldn't
stand,
unless
congress
affirmatively
intended
to
allow
such
a
conflict.
mr.
jordan
rossen
it
is
stipulated,
justice
o'connor,
at
page
173
of
the
record
that
all
claimants
paid
these
dues,
these
emergency
dues
in
accordance
with
the
uaw
constitution.
thus,
there
is
no
evidence
that
anyone
refused
to
pay
the
dues.
mr.
jordan
rossen
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
union
took
any
action
against
any
of
the
members
in
terms
of
trying
to
get
someone's
job
or
anything
else
under
section
8(a)(3).
it
is
our
position
that
the
dues
were
lawfully
required
dues
under
the
union
constitution
and,
in
fact,
it
is
stipulated
and
found
that
they
were
paid
under
the
union
constitution
and,
thus,
they
were
required
to
be
union
members.
so,
failure
to
pay
those
dues
based
on
those
stipulations
would
jeopardize
a
person's
union
membership
if
he
refused
or
she
refused
to
pay
those
dues.
mr.
jordan
rossen
below
and
in
this
court
we
have
not
ask
that
the
michigan
financing
disqualificational
provision
be
stricken.
mr.
jordan
rossen
pardon?
mr.
jordan
rossen
on
its
face,
that
is
right.
mr.
jordan
rossen
we
concede
that
it
can
apply
and
be
used
as
a
disqualification
when
it
is
not
based
on
the
exercise
of
someone's
section
7
rights.
mr.
jordan
rossen
well,
it
may
or
may
not,
justice
stevens.
for
example,
there
are
situations
where
an
individual
might
send
money
if
there
is
an
existing
strike
and
that
individual
could
do
it
alone,
that
individual
may
or
may
not
be
a
union
member,
and
that
might
be
used
as
a
basis
for
disqualifying
someone
from
financing
and
it
would
not
involve
the
exercise
of
section
7
rights.
mr.
jordan
rossen
well,
our
position
first
of
all
is
that
is
not
what
happened
here.
mr.
jordan
rossen
but,
i
didn't
want
to
leave
any
misunderstanding
on
that
score.
but,
if
the
union
did
that
and
all
the
money
was
going
to
the
strikers--
mr.
jordan
rossen
--i
was
going
to
say
if
the
money
was
going
to
the
strikers
and
the
union
is
a
mere
collection
agent,
i
am
not
sure
if
it
makes
a
difference
if
it
is
labelled
dues
or
not
and
i
am
not
sure
that
would
really
involve
assisting
the
union,
even
though
the
union
is
a
collection
agent,
any
more
than
if
the
union
collects
money
for
the
united
fund
and
sends
it
to
someone.
but,
if
the
money
goes
into
a
large
pot,
then
i
think...
into
the
union's
strike
fund,
even
though
unlike
this
case
there
is
an
existing
strike
at
the
time,
then
i
think
the
case
would
be
very
much
like
general
motors
versus
bowling
which
was
decided
by
the
illinois
supreme
court
and
the
illinois
supreme
court
there
said
that
because
the
union
was
really
deciding
how
this
money
was
going
to
be
paid,
the
union
would
decide
when
to
pay
it
and
how
much
and
to
whom,
and
it
was
not
these
dues...
and
there
they
were
people
in
the
same
plant
paying
dues,
increased
dues,
double
dues,
the
illinois
supreme
court
said
it
would
not
interpret
financing
under
its
statute
to
apply
to
those
payments
because
they
were
dues
and
the
union
really
was
deciding
how
it
ought
to
pay
them.
now,
that
is
different
from
a
situation
where
the
payer
knows
that
100
percent
of
the
money
paid
is
going
to...
even
if
it
goes
into
a
pot...
is
going
to
be
sent
to
people
on
the
existing
strike.
but,
we
think
the
bowling
situation,
the
example
that
i
gave
there,
it
is
our
position
that
that
would
be
preempted
even
though
it
would
leave
our
case
as
a
much
stronger
case
for
preemption,
we
believe
that
there
also
would
be
preemption
in
that
case
and
that
congress
did
not
intend
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
or
the
social
security
act
to
disqualify
anyone
for
financing,
let
alone
for
paying
dues.
did
that
get
closer?
mr.
jordan
rossen
in
terms
of
the
legislative
history,
the
national
labor
relations
act
does
not
provide
any
guidance
as
to
congressional
intent
in
this
case.
and,
in
1935
when
the
social
security
act
was
passed,
there
was
no
financing
provision
in
any
state
labor
dispute
statute.
so,
for
that
reason
you
cannot
say,
unlike
in
new
york
telephone,
for
example,
where
there
was
an
existing
statute
that
congress
perhaps
was
aware
of,
you
cannot
say
that
congress
was
aware
of
any
financing
provision
in
1935.
now,
the
state
of
michigan
relies
on
1936
action
by
the
social
security
board.
after
the
social
security
act
was
passed
where
the
social
security
board
recommended
changing
the
disqualification
of
everyone
in
a
struck
establishment
to
only
apply
to
situations
where
people
participate,
finance,
or
are
directly
interested
in
those
excused
within
that
establishment.
but,
in
1940,
the
social
security
board,
aware
of
a
few
applications
by
state
agencies,
not
courts,
recommended
eliminating
any
financing
provisions
in
these
statutes
because,
as
the
social
security
board
said,
it
might
be
used
to
disqualify
people
for
solely
for
payment
of
dues.
now,
in
1943,
congress
indicated
its
awareness
of
this
social
security
board
action
because
it
changed
a
district
of
columbia
statute
to
do
as
suggested
in
1936
by
adding
participating
and
directly
interest,
but
it
specifically
omitted
the
financing
provision.
and,
since
1935,
no
state
court
until
this
michigan
court
has
ever
disqualified
anyone
under
a
financing
provision
for
solely
paying
union
dues.
now,
what
we
mean
by
that
when
we
saying
"for
solely
paying
union
dues",
we
mean
in
other
cases
where
dues
may
have
been
involved,
the
people
were
also
in
the
same
establishment
as
the
strikers,
they
were
also
held
to
be
interested
in
the
strike
financially,
and
they
were
also
held
to
be
participating,
so
there
is
no
pure
dues
holding
in
unemployment
insurance
history
in
the
united
states
by
a
court
until
this
one,
and
there--
this
gets
to
be
a
little
bit
back
to
justice
stevens'
question.
there
is
something
else
that
is
also
flukey
about
this
michigan
decision.
the
financing
provisions
came
out
of
english
law
and
they
were
aimed
at
situations
where
people
in
a
factory
were
striking
and
other
people,
knowing
of
those
strikes,
sent
money
to
those
strikers
when
then
caused
their
own
layoffs.
in
every
other
financing
decision
in
the
united
states,
including
agencies,
whether
or
not
they
involve
dues,
they
all
involve
the
same
situation
of
an
existing
strike
that
people
were
sending
money
to.
we
mention
this
because
it
emphasizes
the
unusual
quality
and
nature
of
the
michigan
decision
which
makes
it,
in
our
opinion,
just
as
unusual
as
what
florida
did
in
nash
where
florida
was
the
only
state
to
interpret
its
labor
dispute
disqualification
in
a
bizarre
way
and
yet
this
court,
despite
the
fact
that
that
was
unusual,
did
not
allow
florida
to
punish
that
worker
because
she
exercised
statutory
rights.
general
motors
relies
on
this
court's
decision
in
new
york
telephone
and
says
that
because
congress,
as
indicated
in
new
york
telephone,
was
apparently
aware
of
a
state
statute
which
paid
benefits
to
strikers
after
disqualification
and
also
disqualified
strikers.
therefore,
it
should
be
assumed
that
congress
also
intended
to
permit
disqualifying
anyone
else
who
exercises
other
section
7
rights
wherever
there
is
a
strike.
but,
as
your
honors
know,
new
york
telephone
rested
on
awareness
by
congress
of
a
specific
statute
which
did
that,
and
as
we
have
shown,
there
was
no
statute
in
existence
in
1935
that
did
what
happened
to
these
people.
and,
the
fact
that
congress
was
aware
that
a
state
may
impede
the
right
to
strike
does
not
mean
that
congress
intended
or
should
be
implied
to
permit
a
state
to
impede
all
other
section
7
rights
or
rather
all
other
nlra
rights,
and
certainly
nash
is
an
example
of
that
holding.
and,
general
motors
concedes
in
its
brief
that
the
state
could
not
disqualify
persons
because
they
are
union
members.
so,
there
are
situations
where
a
state's
labor
dispute
disqualification
has
been
limited.
and,
striking
for
nlra
purposes
and
for
unemployment
insurance
purposes
is
different
than
other
section
7
rights,
particularly
the
rights
of
free
association.
strikers
leave
work
and
things
can
happen
to
them
under
the
nlra
that
economically
disadvantage
them.
general
motors
could
have
replaced
the
foundry
strikers
if
it
had
wished,
permanent
replace
them,
but
general
motors
could
not
have
punished
these
appellants
because
they
chose
to
pay
these
dues
even
if
there
was
a
foundry
strike
in
existence
at
the
time
and
even
if
some
of
those
dues
reached
those
foundry
strikers.
general
motors
could
not
have
laid
them
off
because
they
paid
these
dues,
and
yet
general
motors
is
asking
this
court,
as
it
did
in
michigan,
to
punish
these
claimants
because
they
paid
these
dues.
mr.
jordan
rossen
yes.
they
were
eligible
in
every
other
respect
but
for
the
fact
that
they
were
held
disqualified
for
paying
these
emergency
dues,
so
they
had
met
all
the
other
eligibility
requirements.
mr.
jordan
rossen
we
do
and
michigan
did
too.
the
michigan
supreme
court
agreed
with
that
much
and
held
that
there
was
a
conflict.
and,
this
gets
us
close,
i
think,
to
what
this
court
did
yesterday
in
golden
state.
we
are
not
asking
michigan
to
pay
benefits
to
these
appellants
because
they
paid
their
union
dues.
we
are
asking
michigan
to
pay
benefits
to
these
appellants
because
they
were
laid
off
and
forced
out
of
work.
and,
yet,
general
motors
is
asking
michigan
to
deny
benefits
to
these
appellants
because
they
paid
those
dues.
general
motors
is
conditioning...
asking
the
state
to
condition
denial
just
on
their
paying
dues
which
they
were
required
to
pay
to
remain
members.
and,
this
court,
every
justice
of
this
court
in
recent
cases,
have
expressed
concerned
for
protection
section
7
rights,
particularly
rights
of
employee
self-organization
which
we
believe
would
include
the
right
to
remain
union
members
and
to
pay
these
dues.
certainly
if
you
leave
the
right
to
resign
unfettered,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
should
leave
the
right
to
remain
unfettered
also
if
people
choose
to
remain
union
members
and
pay
these
dues.
we
do
think
it
burdens
those
rights.
mr.
jordan
rossen
yes.
employers
are
allowed
to
take
action
against
strikers--
mr.
jordan
rossen
--that
is
right.
and,
they
can
replace
strikers,
as
i
indicated
earlier,
and
state
statutes
allow...
state
statutes
regularly
disqualify
strikers
from
unemployment
compensation
and
they
would
have
done
that--
mr.
jordan
rossen
--no,
no.
we--
mr.
jordan
rossen
--yes,
it
does
burden
section
7
rights
to
deny
benefits
to
strikers.
mr.
jordan
rossen
the
state
may
do
it
because
as
your
honor
said
in
new
york
telephone
congress
intended
to
permit
them
to
do
it.
mr.
jordan
rossen
exactly,
to
strikers.
mr.
jordan
rossen
and,
strikers
have
not
been
treated
the
same
or
synonymously
with
dues
payers--
mr.
jordan
rossen
--and
but
for
congress'
awareness,
as
indicated
in
new
york
telephone,
that
might
be
considered
improper
too.
but,
strikers,
even
if
there
were
no
labor
dispute
disqualification,
justice
white,
strikers
are
different
because
they
voluntarily
leave
their
jobs
and
congress
was
probably
aware
that...
in
1935...
people
who
leave
their
jobs
voluntarily
generally
don't
get
unemployment
compensation.
even
if
you
had
no
labor
dispute
statute...
i
mean
it
is
the
traditional
unemployment
insurance
concept,
as
old
as
any
unemployment
insurance
statute
in
history
that
people
who
leave
work
are
disqualified
from
unemployment
compensation.
mr.
jordan
rossen
they
were
the
low
seniority
people
at
their
plants
who
were
laid
off
by
general
motors
when
they
wanted
to
continue
working
because
there
was
a
shortage
of
materials.
mr.
jordan
rossen
yes,
that
is
right.
they
were
out
of
their
jobs...
they
were
involuntarily
out
of
work,
laid
off
by
general
motors
because
general
motors
didn't
have
enough
parts
because
of
those
foundry
strikes
and
general
motors
chose
to
lay
off
these
appellants,
comparatively
few
appellants
at
each
plant
which
was
a
humane
reaction
in
a
way,
they
didn't
lay
off
everyone.
if
possible
we
would
like
to
reserve
any
further
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
jordan
rossen
a
few
things,
your
honor,
if
i
may.
mr.
cohen
may
not
think
it
is
important
if
it
is
voluntary,
but
justice
ryan
in
his
opinion
for
the
three
justices
of
the
michigan
court
said
that
it
was
necessary
to
find
voluntariness
before
you
disqualify
people
for
financing.
mr.
jordan
rossen
it
was
a
construction
of
the
michigan
law,
not
what
congress
meant,
and
the
reason
i
am
making
the
point,
justice
rehnquist,
is
that
in
order
to
find
voluntariness
of
these
appellants,
justice
ryan
said
they
will
be
presumed
to
have
done
this
voluntarily
if
they
paid
these
dues
in
accordance
with
the
union's
rules
and
constitution.
so,
i
think
the
whole
thing
is
tied
up
and
it
is
not
so
much
a
question
of
whether
the
dues
are
regular
or
irregular,
it
is
the
question...
we
say
it
is
whether
the
dues
were
required
to
maintain
membership,
whether
they
were
proper
under
lander
and
griffin--
mr.
jordan
rossen
--i
definitely
am
not
rearguing
hodory,
justice
rehnquist.
i
am
not
saying
that
you
cannot
disqualify
people
in
a
labor
dispute
section
under
all
circumstances.
for
example,
the
other
two
counsel
talked
about
the
single
establishment
situation
of
which
congress
was
aware
in
1935
where
you
disqualified
everyone
in
the
establishment
or
who
were
laid
off
due
to
a
labor
dispute.
that
might
mean
disqualifying
people
even
though
they
were
involuntarily
out
of
work.
we
agree
that
this
could
happen,
but
the
difference
is
in
that
situation
you
disqualify
union
members
and
non-union
members
alike
and
you
don't
base
the
disqualification
on
their
exercise
of
any
section
7
right,
you
just
disqualify
everyone
in
the
establishment.
and,
your
honors
held
in
hodory
whether
or
not
that
is
fair
that
is
certainly
lawful.
and,
we
don't
quarrel
with
that
decision.
that
does
not
involve
section
7
rights.
the
question...
both
counsel...
the
united
states
didn't
do
it
in
its
brief,
but
both
counsel
use
what
we
call
a
countervailing
machinist's
argument
and
say
that
gm
is
hampered
economically
somehow
if
you
pay
these
non-strikers,
and
that
therefore
you
should
let
michigan
impede
their
expressed
section
7
rights.
the
economic
effect
on
gm's
ability
to
conduct
the
foundry
strikes
does
not
justify
impeding
these
section
7
rights.
when
congress
provides
for
a
section
7
protected
right,
by
definition
congress
also
tolerates
some
implicit
economic
effect
on
the
employer
or
someone
else.
so,
you
can't
say
this
amounts
to
the
type
of
congressional
intent
that
this
court
found
in
new
york
telephone
where
there
was
an
expressed
awareness
of
these
things.
in
effect,
if
you
look
at
congressional
intent,
in
1935,
the
state
statutes
that
were
then
in
existence
paid
unemployment
compensation
to
non-strikers
at
other
locations
who
were
laid
off
during
strikes.
so,
if
there
is
any
economic
imbalance
here,
congress
was
probably
aware
of
it.
i
mean,
traditionally
unemployment
compensation
is
paid
to
people
who
are
laid
off
due
to
other
situations.
and,
when
they
say,
in
response
to
justice
marshall's
question,
that
somehow
these
claimants
contributed
to
their
unemployment,
it
is
a
little
far-fetched,
we
think,
to
say
that
when
they
paid
$40
in
october
1967
this
caused
a
shortage
of
castings
at
the
foundries
in
january
1968.
i
mean,
i
don't
think
anyone...
certainly
there
is
no
finding
below
to
support
that
unusual
theory.
nor
is
there
a
finding
below
to
support
gm's
arguments
that
these
claimants
were
allied
with
the
foundry
workers.
gm's
economic
balance
argument
is
based
on
facts
that
don't
exist
here
and,
as
justice
o'connor,
i
believe...
her
questions
indicate
some
concern
about
this.
if
these
appellants
had
been
in
league
with
the
foundry
workers,
closely
allied
with
them
or
had
there
been
a
national
contract
that
was
open
that
could
have
possibly
benefited
them,
they
would
have
been
disqualified
under
other
michigan
statute
sections
anyway.
you
wouldn't
reach
these
issues
here
and
states
generally
take
care
of
those
concerns.
so,
apart
from
the
fact
that
general
motors'
argument
is
purely
speculative,
if
you
look
at
it
at
all,
michigan
takes
care
of
these
things.
michigan
avoids
the
economic
imbalance
problem
that
was
in
new
york
telephone
by
denying
benefits
to
strikers
and
that
is
a
fairly
effective
way
of
avoiding
it.
mr.
jordan
rossen
they
could
pay
strikers?
mr.
jordan
rossen
i
am
not
sure.
your
honor
held...
this
court
held
in
new
york
telephone
that
they
could
pay
strikers
after
eight
weeks.
the
government
argued
in
new
york
telephone
that
it
would
be
such
an
outrage
to
pay
strikers
from
the
beginning,
and
the
dissents
pointed
that
out
too,
that
i
am
not
sure
what
this
court
would
do
with
a
case
involving
a
state
that
paid
benefits
from
the
first
day
to
strikers.
i
really
don't.
the
basis
of
the
decision
in
new
york
telephone
was
that
congress
was
aware
of
that
specific
new
york
statute.
mr.
jordan
rossen
well,
i
don't
think
this
case
involves
affecting
neutrality
certainly
in
any
way
that
hurts
general
motors
regardless
of
what
you
do.
when
you
impede
an
express
section
7
right,
not
you
personally,
but
when
the
state
does,
that
action
is
preempted
unless
you
find
congressional
intent
to
permit
it.
and,
you
don't
even
have
to
get
to
any
questions
of
neutrality.
congress
took
care
of
the
neutrality
argument
when
it
said
in
the
nlra
preamble--
mr.
jordan
rossen
--that
would
be
permitted
because--
mr.
jordan
rossen
--it
does,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
jordan
rossen
--they
can
do
that
because
you
held--
mr.
jordan
rossen
--no,
that
is
not
why
they
can
do
it.
mr.
jordan
rossen
they
can
do
it
because
this
court
held
that
congress
intended
to
permit
it--
mr.
jordan
rossen
--because
congress
was
aware
in
1935
of
statutes
that
did
that
expressly.
the
new
york
statute
denied
benefits
to
strikers
for
eight
weeks.
other
statutes
denied
benefits
to
strikers
from
the
beginning
and
that
is
why--
mr.
jordan
rossen
--well,
this
court
held
that
the
nlra
didn't
indicate
that
you
could
affect
these
rights
one
way
or
the
other,
but
this
court
looked
to
the
social
security
act,
i
believe,
and
the
fact
that
the
new
york
statute
in
question
was
on
the
books
at
the
time
that
congress
passed
the
social
security
act
in
1935.
that
is
where
this
court
found
there
was
congressional
intent
or
at
least
some
of
the
justices.
mr.
jordan
rossen
i
did
the
same
thing
last
week.
i
covered
up
the
red
light
with
my--
