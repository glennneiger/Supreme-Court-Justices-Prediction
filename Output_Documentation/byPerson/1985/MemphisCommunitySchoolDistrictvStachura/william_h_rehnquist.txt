justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
berardo,
did
you
say
that
punitive
damages
would
be
available
in
a
case
like
this
against
the
school
district?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
of
the
city
of
newport?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
berardo,
you
don't
question,
do
you,
that
a
jury
properly
instructed
in
your
view
of
the
law
of
the
case
could
have
returned
this
amount
of
damages
for
the
plaintiff
or
do
you
question
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
that
is
why
i
asked
you
the
question.
assuming
that
the
jury
had
not
received
this
instruction
that
you
claim
was
wrong
and
had
been
properly
instructed
in
your
view
of
the
law,
do
you
think
it
could
nonetheless...
could
you
claim
that
a
verdict
by
this
was
excessive?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
isn't
an
invariable.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
he
got
some
very
bad
publicity,
didn't
he,
of
the
same
sort
that
a
libel
plaintiff
is
apt
to
get?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
you
have
problems
with
carey
against
piphus.
you
have
got
to
limit
that
to
procedural
due
process.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
you
have
to
say
that
the
holding
of
carey
against
piphus
as
to
procedural
due
process
violation
damages
would
not
be
carried
over
into
the
first
amendment
area.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
he
was...
it
was
held
he
was
denied
procedural
due
process.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
that
denial
is
regardless
of
whether
or
not
after
a
hearing
he
would
have
been
found
guilty.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
at
least
that...
the
carey
opinion
suggests
that
you
don't
get
anything
in
the
way
of
substantive
damages
by
reason
of
the
fact
you
were
denied
the
constitutional
right
to
procedural
due
process.
you
have
to
show
something,
emotional
distress,
some
traditional
element
of
damage.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
that
instruction...
you
know,
maybe
he
read
it
in
the
context
that
it
isn't
all
that
harmful,
but
that
part
of
the
instruction
embodies
the
idea
that
the
denial
of
the
right
itself
entitles
you
to
substantial
damages
without,
as
you
say,
your
plaintiff
getting
on
the
stand
proving
anything.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
perhaps
it
is
belied
by
the
balance
of
the
instructions,
but
do
you
feel
that
even
the
particular
instruction
that
the
petition
brings
here
doesn't
permit
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
this
had
been
a
diversity
case
that
was
being
tried
before
judge
harvey
in
port
huron
and
the
defendant
was
someone...
the
school
board
had
done
exactly
these
same
things
to
the
plaintiff
except
there
was
no
claim
that
there
was
a
federal
constitutional
violation,
it
was
a
claim
that
it
was
a
violation
of
michigan
state
law.
the
plaintiff
suffered
all
the
exact
same
damages
that
you
say
your
client
did.
now,
is
your
client
entitled
to
an
extra
measure
of
damages
over
the
hypothetical
case
i
proposed
simply
because
his
identical
damages
stem
from
a
violation
of
a
first
amendment
rather
than
state
law?
