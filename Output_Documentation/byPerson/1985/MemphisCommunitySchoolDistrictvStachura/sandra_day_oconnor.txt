mr.
berardo,
if
we
were
to
agree
with
you
on
the
single
question
of
proper
instructions
for
damages
for
intrinsic
value
of
a
constitutional
right,
is
there
any
need
to
do
more
than
to
remand
it
for
a
new
trial
on
damages
alone
as
opposed
to
liability?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
isn't
the
real
question
we
have
whether
these
instructions
then
permitted
the
jury
to
base
their
award
of
damages
in
part
or
in
whole
on
the
jury's
estimate
of
the
intrinsic
value
of
the
constitutional
right
as
opposed
to
all
those
things
you
have
been
telling
us
about?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that
isn't
the
allegation,
is
it?
we
are
not
being
asked
to
do
something
based
on
the
size
of
the
verdict.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
your
objection
go
to
causation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
as
i
looked
at
it,
your
objection
to
the
instruction
was
that
they
allowed
the
jury
to
speculate
on
the
value
of
a
constitutional
right
citing
carey.
