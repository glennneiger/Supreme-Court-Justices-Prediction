justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
counsel,
because
you
started
out
with
carey
v.
piphus,
is
it
your
position
that
damages,
intangible
damages,
emotional
distress
and
mental
damages,
are
recoverable
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
including
this
one?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
misread
your
brief.
and,
including
a
case
like
carey
against
piphus?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
you
for
a
minute
because
i
must
confess
from
the
beginning
i
am
having
a
little
bit
of
difficulty.
are
you
contending
that
the
instructions
told
the
jury
that
they
could
award
damages
even
if
there
were
no
injury
to
the
plaintiffs
of
any
kind?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
reading
from
page
93.
"if
you
find
that
the
plaintiff
is
entitled
to
a
verdict,
you
may
award
him
only
such
damages
as
will
reasonably
compensate
him
for
such
injury
and
damage
you
find
from
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
"
don't
they
in
so
many
words
say
there
has
to
be
an
injury?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
says,
"damages
for
type
of
injury
are
more
difficult
to
measure.
"
doesn't
that
assume
there
has
got
to
be
an
injury?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
a
hypothetical
question.
supposing
you
had
a
community
that
wouldn't...
that
didn't
like
one
particular
religion,
say
they
didn't
like
catholics,
and
there
was
a
priest
in
town
that
wanted
to
go
to
mass
and
the
police
just
wouldn't
let
him
go
to
mass
and
he
brought
a
1983
and
he
couldn't
prove
any
damages,
he
just
was
not
allowed
to
exercise
his
right
to
go
to
church,
damages
or
no
damages?
justice
john
paul
stevens
suppose
it
didn't
cause
him
anything,
he
just
couldn't
go
to
church
and
he
very
deeply
wanted
to
go
to
church.
