justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
denial--
justice
byron
r.
white
say
that
again.
our
action
does
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
go
ahead.
you
do
it
your
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
do
it
your
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
injury
is
the
deprivation
of
the
constitutional
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
the
injury
the
deprivation
of
the
constitutional
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
think
you
would
say
the
court
was
implying
or
saying
that
it
is
enough
to
find
injury
in
a
sense
of
the
deprivation
of
a
constitutional
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
very
well.
i
would
think
you
would
say
that
is
exactly
what
the
court
meant.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
wouldn't
be
unconstitutional.
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
hence,
i
take
it,
you
would
say
it
would
be
quite
proper
for
the
judge
to
say
now
as
a
matter
of
damages
i
am
instructing
you
that
there
has
been
no
evidence
presented
of
any
actual
injury
in
the
sense
of
monetary
loss
or
pain
or
suffering
or
humiliation
or
anything
like
that.
but,
there
is
a
constitutional
right
involved
and
was
violated
and
the
jury
may
consider
what
that
is
worth
and
return
a
judgment
for
whatever
damages
they
think
it
is
worth.
i
take
it
that
is
what
you
think
the
jury
should
be
permitted
to
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
it
quite
well
is
presented
in
this
case.
so
what
is
your
answer
to
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
my
example
where
the
judge
says
there
is
no
evidence
of
any
other
damages
except
the
denial
of
this
constitutional
right
and
he
said,
of
course,
the
plaintiff
hasn't
gotten
on
the
stand
and
claimed
that
it
really
hurt
him
any,
but
members
of
the
jury,
you
are
entitled
to
give
damages
for
the
violation
of
this
right,
whatever
you
think
it
is
worth.
justice
byron
r.
white
no
matter
what
the
constitutional
right
is
involved.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
other
constitutional
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
might
be
too
much
to
make
a
plaintiff
get
up
on
the
stand
and
attempt
to
say
how
he
really
has
been
injured
if
some
other
kind
of
constitutional
right
is
involved
like
freedom
of
speech
or--
justice
byron
r.
white
--so,
it
is
just
really
a
question
of
whether
or
not...
what
chance
there
is
that
the
jury
pay
too
much
attention
to
the
last
part
of
his
instruction.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
the
one
who
requested
the
instruction
the
judge
gave
about
constitutional
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
i
suppose
in
the
record
here
that
that
request
is
contained
somewhere.
it
is
not
contained
in
the
printed
record.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
transcript.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
that
in
the
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
it
is
in
the
record
that
has
been
lodged
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
saying
as
long
as
you
get
on
the
stand
and
prove
up
a
major
injury
by
the
way
of
emotional
distress,
if
it
so
happens
you
have
been
denied
the
right
to
go
to
church
and
that
is
a
denial
of
an
important
constitutional
right,
the
jury
should
maybe
double
the
damages
it
otherwise
would
have
awarded
just
because
of
the
nature
of
the
constitutional
right
that
is
involved.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
that
was
the
argument
you
were
making.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
what
i
say.
you
would
say
the
jury
should
be
able
to
give
more
damages
for
mental
anguish.
if
the
constitutional
right
is
not
being
able
to
go
to
church,
then
perhaps
say
the
denial
of
a
procedural
due
process.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
weren't
satisfied
with
those
instructions.
you
asked
for
the
additional
instructions.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
short,
if
except
for
the
fact
that
there
were
constitutional
rights
involved,
you
would
have
found
$50,000
worth
of
damage,
because
of
constitutional
rights
you
are
entitled
to
return
$200,000.
