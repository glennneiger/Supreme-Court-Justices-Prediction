mr.
jeffrey
a.
heldt
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
berardo
and
i
have
been
trying
two
different
cases
since
at
least
1982
when
this
case
went
to
trial.
i
guess
it
does
my
heart
good
we
still
are.
the
issue
here
as
we
see
it
is
not
as
it
has
been
defined
by
the
petition
or
by
the
petitioners.
the
issue
is
rather
does
carey
versus
piphus
require
a
jury
to
ignore
the
historical
and
contextual
significance
of
the
constitutional
rights
it
finds
were
violated
when
it
reaches
the
point
in
its
deliberations
that
it
must
assess
damages
and
assign
a
monetary
value.
we
think
the
answer
is
obviously
no.
we
don't
expect
a
jury
should
be
compelled
to
ignore
both
our
history
and
the
context
of
the
activities
in
which
the
plaintiff
was
engaged
in
at
the
time
his
rights
were
violated.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
heldt
wholly
apart
from
any
instruction?
mr.
jeffrey
a.
heldt
they
certainly
could.
i
think
that
a
plaintiff
is
entitled
to
an
instruction
assuring
the
jury
that
they
may
and
that
is
all
we
are
talking
about
here.
they
may
consider
all
sorts
of
things
in
the
jury
room
that
we
generally
never
know
about
because
we
simply
don't
try
and
ask
them
afterwards
in
any
legal
way
what
did
you
do
and
how
did
you
reach
your
results?
mr.
jeffrey
a.
heldt
well,
i
don't
think
that
issue
is
presented
in
this
case
and
i
am
loathe
to
speak
on
behalf
of--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
heldt
--my
answer
is
that
that
would
be
permissible
depending
on
the
nature
of
the
constitutional
right
which
was
violated.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
heldt
as
justice
stevens
said,
if
you
are
not
allowed
to
go
to
church,
perhaps
that
is
a
case--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
heldt
--no,
i
don't
think
that
is
true.
i
don't
think
that
carey
requires
that
you
must
either
establish
some
separate
quantum
of
proof
of
damage
or
be
precluded
from
any
at
all.
carey
expressly
reserves
the
question
to
a
later
day
depending
exactly
what
constitutional
right
has
been
violated.
in
carey
we
dealt
only
with
the
right
of
procedural
due
process.
and,
indeed,
there
was
substantial
evidence
in
a
stipulated
record
that
the
student
was
guilty
of
smoking
a
marijuana
cigarette
on
school
grounds
during
school
hours.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
heldt
i
think
that
is
clearly
correct.
i
think
that
is
unmistakable
from
the
analysis
of
the
opinion
and
i
wouldn't
seek
to
do
otherwise.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
heldt
i
am
not
sure
i
can,
but
i
don't
think
that
any
plaintiff
can.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
heldt
i
don't
think
any
plaintiff
can.
we
simply
do
not
in
our
legal
system
require
the
jury
to
set
forth
a
calculus.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
heldt
they
broke
those
awards
out
by
party.
frankly,
it
surprised
me.
no
one
objected
to
that
formulation
of
the
special
interrogatory.
i
would
have
expected
them
to
put
the
same
numbers
for
each
individual,
but
the
jury
did
not.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
heldt
not
that
i
am
aware
of.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
heldt
well,
there
is
a
special
verdict
forum
here,
but
when
it
came
to
the
question
of
what
value
do
you
place
on
the
damages
that
you
find
are
appropriate,
we
don't
ask
them
how
did
you
do
it,
did
you
accept
the
plaintiff's
lawyer's
calculus
and
multiply
these
numbers
together
to
come
up
with
your
verdict?
did
you
compromise
between
what
the
defendant
insisted
and
what
the
plaintiff
insisted?
did
you
adopt
some
third
theory?
we
don't
ask
them
to
tell
us.
we
don't
put
them
on
the
witness
stand
as
it
were
after
they
return
their
verdict
and
decide
whether
we
agree
with
the
number.
the
traditional,
legal
and
judicial
remedy
as
you
look
at
that
number
taken
as
a
whole
against
the
facts
of
the
case
and
if
it
is
sufficiently
monstrous,
there
is
authority
to,
either
by
remittur
or
new
trial,
start
over
again.
but,
that
has
been
rejected
twice
in
this
case
by
the
trial
judge
himself
as
well
as
by
the
sixth
circuit.
i
would
submit
three
propositions
to
suggest
that
our
formulation
that
carey
certainly
doesn't
preclude
the
jury
to
take
these
items
into
consideration
control
here.
one
is
carey
itself.
the
second
is
the
facts
of
this
case
and
especially
the
conduct
of
the
trial
itself
justified
a
challenged
instruction.
and,
thirdly,
the
principal
arguments
that
are
raised
here
are
raised
for
the
first
time.
you
can
read
those
sixth
circuit
briefs,
you
can
read
the
motions
for
a
new
trial
in
the
district
court,
and
you
simply
will
not
find
arguments
about
ambiguities
of
causation.
you
will
find
no
proposed
and
rejected
instructions
on
causation
or
any
different
form
of
verdict
as
proposed
by
the
defendants
who
now
on
brief
suggest
that
the
damages
need
to
be
segregated
among
plaintiff's
theories,
and
as
i
understand
mr.
berardo's
oral
argument
this
afternoon,
to
suggest,
well,
no,
i
think
that
is
useless.
it
was
never
asked
for
below.
i
don't
think
they
are
entitled
to
complain
about
it
now.
i
think
i
have
already
described
the
salient
points
with
respect
to
our
view
of
carey.
it
was
a
case
on
stipulated
facts
without
any
substantive
underlying
contest.
at
least
mr.
piphus
certainly
didn't
have
a
very
good
one
on
the
stipulated
facts.
the
principal
caught
him
in
the
school
yard
with
a
cigarette
that
got
thrown
in
the
bushes.
there
was
a
strong
smell
of
marijuana
and
he
was
suspended.
it
really
doesn't
raise
any
substantive
issues
about
was
he
guilty
or
not
and
how
elaborate
a
hearing
do
we
need
to
decide
whether
he
was
guilty
or
innocent.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
heldt
that
is
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
heldt
but,
what
the
court
in
carey
says
is
that
that
creates
an
ambiguity
of
causation.
we
don't
know.
there
is
no
proof
that
mr.
piphus
suffered
any
anguish,
lost
anything
as
a
result
of
being
suspended
from
school
for
20
days,
but
even
if
he
presented
proofs,
we
don't
know
whether
he
was
anguished
because
he
was
caught
guilty
in
the
school
yard
or
is
anguished
because
he
didn't
get
a
chance
to
plead
for
mercy
before
he
was
punished.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
heldt
carey,
i
think,
clearly
requires
that.
it
says
we
will
not
presume
it.
it
is
not
too
much
to
ask
a
plaintiff
if
they
contend
that
their
injury
arises
from
the
nature
of
the
wrong,
to
get
on
the
witness
stand
and
try
and
explain
it,
try
and
quantify
it
in
some
way
that
the
jury
can
deal
with
it,
or
the
factfinder.
i
believe
carey
was
non-jury
case.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
heldt
i
don't
believe
that
carey
would
permit
that.
carey
certainly
doesn't--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
heldt
--that
is
what
i
was
going
to
say.
carey
clearly
does
not
permit
that
if
the
only
claim
before
the
jury
is
the
denial
of
procedural
due
process.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
heldt
it
leaves
that
open
and
it
says
expressly
it
depends
on
what
right
you
are
talking
about.
are
you
talking
about
a
first
amendment
right
to
go
to
church,
are
you
talking
about
a
right
to
be
secure
in
your
home
from--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
heldt
--i
don't
think
it
is
ever
too
much
to
expect
a
plaintiff
to
try
and
articulate
that,
but
the
question
as
a
legal
matter
i
don't
see
as
being
before
the
court
in
this
case
because
the
plaintiff
took
the
stand
and
he
testified
at
length
about
the
consequences
of
these
deprivations
on
him.
his
wife
testified.
we
brought
in
expert
testimony
with
respect
to
the
stigmatization
issue.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
heldt
i
don't--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
heldt
--i
don't
think
that
is
true
and
i
think
it
is
belied
by
the
balance
of
the
instructions.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
heldt
i
don't
think
it
permits
it
in
the
context
of
this
case
because
it
was
never
argued
that
way.
if
you
go
back
to
my
closing
argument,
i
didn't
ask
for
emotional
damages
and
then
say
to
the
jury,
now,
give
me
some
more,
give
me
an
award
for
the
intrinsic
value
of
a
constitutional
right.
i
didn't
argue
that
at
all.
i
said
to
the
jury,
my
client
has
suffered
1,144
days
of
human
misery
waiting
to
get
to
this
courtroom
to
vindicate
himself
and
i
think
he
is
entitled
to
compensation
for
that
and
i
then
said
to
the
jury,
there
are
other
ways
to
approach
damages.
you
don't
have
to
do
that.
you
can
approach
damages,
this
court
will
tell
you,
i
said
to
the
jury,
on
the
basis
of
the
constitutional
rights
that
you
find
violated
and
i
had
discussed
those
extensively
in
closing
argument
with
respect
to
establishing
the
elements
of
my
case
that
plaintiff
had
been
denied
of
liberty
interests,
he
had
been
denied
a
right
of
privacy,
he
had
been
denied
a
right
of
academic
freedom,
and
he
had
also
been
denied
a
right
to
due
process,
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
and
to
vindicate
himself.
and,
i
discussed
those
at
length
and
i
said,
you
can
evaluate
those
rights
and
you
can
make
an
award
on
that
basis,
and
then
i
said,
in
either
event,
it
really
boils
down
to
what
ed
stachura
has
been
through,
what
has
it
made
him
live
through
in
his
own
mind
and
in
the
public
eye.
that
is
right
in
the
transcript,
exactly
what
i
argued
to
this
jury.
i
didn't
ask
for
things
that
perhaps
i
might
have
asked
for
if
i
interpreted
the
instruction
the
way--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
heldt
--yes.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
heldt
it
is
not
contained
in
the
printed
record.
it
would
be
contained
in--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
heldt
--no,
it
would
be
contained
in
the
series
of
proposed
written
instructions
which
were
presented
to
the
court
before
trial.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
heldt
yes,
but
not
in
the
transcript.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
heldt
yes,
yes,
it
is.
it
was
not
asked
for
so
we
could
ask
for
two
measures
of
recovery,
one
for
mr.
stachura's
mental
anguish
and
a
second
measure
of
recovery
for
some
intrinsic
or
inherent
value
of
a
constitutional
right.
and,
i
think
that
is
well
demonstrated
by
the
closing
argument.
we
simply
didn't
ask
for
that.
we
said
you
can
do
it
in
one
of
two
ways.
in
either
event,
the
teaching
of
carey
that
there
must
be
proof
of
actual
damage
before
the
jury
is
allowed
to
cogitate
on
what
monetary
value
to
place
on
those
damages
i
think
is
unmistakable.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
heldt
if
you
are
asking
me
do
i
think
that
is
a
permissible
argument
for
plaintiff
to
make--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
heldt
--no.
i
am
saying
that
they
are
entitled
to
consider
the
significance
of
the
conduct
in
which
my
client
was
engaged
and
the
significance
of
the
rights
which
are
violated
in
deciding
whether
his
mental
anguish
is
genuine,
in
deciding
how
big
it
is,
how
severe
it
is.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
heldt
no,
i
would
formulate
it
differently.
i
would
say
there
is
a
world
of
difference
between
a
plaintiff
who
suffers
mental
anguish
because
a
tornado
came
out
of
the
midwestern
skies
and
killed
his
family.
he
suffers
all
the
mental
anguish
in
the
world,
but
it
comes
from
something
that
is
unpredictable
and
uncontrollable
and
that
is
just
a
part
of
life.
that
is
not
the
same
as
the
plaintiff
who
instead
of
being
struck
down
by
a
tornado
is
struck
down
by
his
professional
colleagues
in
a
scheme
to
scapegoat
him
to
protect
their
own
skin.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
heldt
do
i
practice
in
memphis
or
in
port
huron
when
the
court
sits?
mr.
jeffrey
a.
heldt
i
practice
with
some
regularity
in
that
state
and
in
those
counties,
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
heldt
as
i
understand
it...
i
have
never
tried
a
wrongful
death
case.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
heldt
as
i
understand
it,
in
wayne
county,
the
county
in
which
detroit
resides,
it
is
probably
in
excess
of
seven
figures.
i
understand
in
port
huron,
michigan,
50
miles
to
the
northeast,
it
is
probably
less
than
six
figures.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
heldt
i
don't
think
that
is
true.
you
asked
what
average
range
of
verdicts
are
in
two
counties
in
cases
that
i
have
never
tried.
i
am
not
responsible
for
justifying
those.
i
am
sure
there
is
an
overlap
in
both
cases.
i
think
there
is
more
in
damage
to
this
case
than
simply
mental
anguish.
as
i
indicated,
i
think
my
client's
privacy
interests
were
violated.
he
became
a
public
figure.
the
question
is
is
that
shown
by
evidence?
i
mean,
we
are
not
speculating
about
it.
it
is
shown
by
the
myriad
of
harassing
phone
calls.
i
think
it
is
shown
by
the
refuge
dumped
on
his
porch.
the
man
became
an
involuntary
public
figure.
i
don't
think
you
can
just
call
that
mental
anguish
and
say
that
takes
care
of
the
recovery.
he
lost
his
zest
for
teaching.
he
couldn't
be
a
zealous
advocate
of
his
own
students.
he
testified
to
that.
he
said
going
back
to
school
in
the
fall
of
1979
under
court
order
was
the
hardest
thing
he
ever
did
in
his
life.
at
the
time
of
trial
he
said
there
is
no
zeal
any
more,
there
is
no
fun.
i
tried
to
do
a
job
and
look
what
has
happened
to
me
without
ever
the
opportunity
to
defend
myself.
i
think
that
is
a
loss
that
is
something
other
than
measured
by
mental
anguish.
we
are
not
asking
the
jury
to
speculate
about
it.
there
is
testimony
in
the
record
that
that
is
a
real
live,
living
and
breathing
loss.
we
offered
expert
testimony
unrebutted
in
this
record
that
mr.
stachura
was
foreclosed
from
a
definite
range
of
employment
opportunities.
his
professional
career
was
dead.
that
is
a
loss.
it
doesn't
translate
itself
into
mental
anguish.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
heldt
no,
i
don't
think
so
and
i
don't
think
this
instruction
says
that.
it
is
not
different
than
if
the
state
court
in
your
hypothetical
instructed
that
you
may
take
into
consideration
that
the
plaintiff
has
suffered
damages
because
the
defendant
violated
state
law.
they
weren't
just
merely
negligent.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
heldt
well,
that
is
the
issue
as
framed
by
the
petitioner
and
to
that
we
say,
first
of
all,
that
all
the
language
of
the
instruction
says
is
you
may
take
into
consideration
the
roots
of
these
rights
and
their
application
in
the
context
of
mr.
stachura's
conduct
at
the
time
those
rights
were
violated
in
deciding
what
quantum
of
damages
should
be
awarded
and
that
we
did
not
argue...
we
simply
did
not
ask
the
jury
to
award
some
extra
element,
award
something
over
and
above
the
reasonable
value
that
they
placed
on
his
suffering.
that
they
placed
it
on
a
higher
plane
that
i
did...
i
mean,
there
is
simply
no
controlling
precedent
or
law
to
suggest
that
there
is
something
wrong
with
that.
indeed,
not
only
the
district
court
but
the
sixth
circuit
said
these
numbers
are
justifiable.
they
did
not
shock
judge
harvey's
judicial
conscience.
he
sits
up
there
and
tries
cases
every
day.
they
did
not
shock
the
conscience
of
the
sixth
circuit
and
i
don't
think
in
the
light
of
the
kinds
of
verdicts
that
are
returned
today,
i
just...
i
think
i
read
about
one
in
the
new
york
times
in
the
last
24
hours,
$13
million
for
somebody
who
was
killed
in
a
amc
jeep.
i
don't
think
$300,000
in
this
case
is
at
all
unreasonable
in
modern
society.
if
it
was
maybe
$2
million
i
might
gulp
when
i
make
that
argument,
but
i
just
don't
think
that
is
the
problem
here.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
heldt
that
seems
to
be
mr.
berardo's
argument
here
today.
he
says
i
don't
know
how
much
the
jury
awarded
for
this,
but
after
all,
it
was
more
than
mr.
heldt
asked
for
and
it
must
mean,
therefore,
that
the
jury
was
misled
by
this
instruction.
you
have
to
remember
that
i
think
he
has
misread
the
whole
text
and
tenor
of
the
court's
instructions.
the
court,
three
different
times
in
laying
out
the
elements
of
my
case,
things
that
i
must
prove
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
said
one
of
the
things
i
must
prove
is
that
the
defendants
by
their
conduct
proximately
caused
the
damage
to
mr.
stachura.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
heldt
i
asked
only
for
an
instruction
which
said
if
you
find
there
is
damage,
and
there
is
clearly
damage
in
this
record,
you
may
take
into
consideration
in
deciding
what
amount
of
money
to
place
on
that
damage,
the
fact
that
these
are
constitutional
rights
and
that
they
are
important
rights
that
the
teacher
was
entitled
to
engage
in--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
heldt
--i
don't
think
that
is
what
the
instruction
says.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
heldt
the
only
limit
was
imposed
by
the
plaintiff's
complaint
which,
as
i
understand
it,
was
considerably
higher
than
the
amount
returned
by
the
verdict.
i
did
not
draft
the
complaint
and
i
did
not
select
the
numbers
in
it.
but,
as
i
recall,
the
complaint
raised
the
issues
of
some
larger
amount.
what
i
want
to
continue
saying,
because
i
think
it
is
important
to
understand
the
distinction
in
a
way
the
jury
instructions
are
drafted,
plaintiff
is
obligated
to
prove
under
these
instructions
every
element
of
his
case,
including
the
conduct
of
the
defendants
prior
proximately
caused
damage
to
the
plaintiff.
that
is
generally
a
threshold
legal
question.
it
is
tested
as
it
was
here
by
motions
for
directed
verdict
at
the
close
of
my
proofs.
did
the
plaintiff
prove
sufficient
damage
that
a
jury
could
find
that
element
has
been
met?
and,
of
course,
the
district
court
said,
yes,
there
is
sufficient
evidence
in
this
record
to
find
some
damage
and
i
am
going
to
allow
the
case
to
go
to
the
jury.
every
single
time
this
court
instructed...
he
actually
did
it
four
times,
the
district
court
actually
did
it
four
times,
three
times
on
mr.
stachura's
claims
and
a
fourth
time
on
the
student
plaintiff,
james
david
mcdonald's
claim,
as
well.
and,
the
court
said,
even
in
the
student
plaintiff's
case,
although
the
student
plaintiff
only
asks
for
nominal
damages
and
nothing
more,
one
of
the
elements
that
james
david
mcdonald
must
prove
is
that
he
suffered
damages
as
a
result
of...
as
a
proximate
result
of
the
conduct
of
the
defendants.
and,
it
is
not
hard
to
understand
in
this
record
why
the
jury
no-caused
mr.
mcdonald
because
mr.
mcdonald
didn't
take
the
stand
and
he
didn't
try
and
testify
that
he
suffered
some
damage
and
there
was
no
expert
testimony
of
damage.
there
was
no
testimony
that
james
david
mcdonald
had
been
damaged
at
all.
what
mr.
berardo
suggests
is
that
the
damage
instructions
have
to
be
merged.
and,
in
fact,
the
opposite
is
the
case.
i
started
to
say
that
once
the
court
is
satisfied
that
a
plaintiff
has
met
that
element
of
proof,
has
established
some
quantum
of
damage,
the
case
goes
to
the
jury
and
the
instructions
on
damages
are
merely
a
guide
to
assessing
and
weighing
the
damages
that
the
jury
is
obligated
to
find
in
order
to
satisfy
those
elements
of
proof.
it
tells
the
jury
what
things
it
may
take
into
consideration,
what
things
it
ought
not
to
take
into
consideration,
it
posits
a
test,
you
ought
to
try
and
put
the
plaintiff
in
the
same
position
as
he
had
been
in
if
his
rights
had
not
been
violated.
the
instructions
are
not
how
to
award
damages
but
how
to
assess
damages
if
you
find
there
are
any
at
all.
there
are
no
four
categories
of
damages
in
the
special
interrogatory
form
as
mr.
berardo
would
suggest.
that
special
interrogatory
form
doesn't
say
how
much
damages
do
you
award
to
compensate
mr.
stachura,
and
if
none,
what
nominal
damages
do
you
award,
and
if
you
award
either,
do
you
award
punitive
and
then
create
a
fourth
category
and
say,
oh,
yes,
now
what
damage
is
the
award
for
the
value
of
constitutional
rights?
at
all
times
there
were
only
three
categories.
and,
indeed,
the
word
compensate
or
compensation
appears
twice
in
the
very
instruction
that
is
before
this
court.
it
is
not
non-compensatory
damages,
it
is
merely
a
part
of
the
calculus
by
which
one
places
a
value
on
things
that
are
generally
intangible.
what
is
the
value
of
a
loss
of
a
leg?
you
can't
decide
that
without
some
notion
of
what
it
is
like
to
live
life
with
two
legs
and
what
it
might
be
like
to
live
life
with
only
one.
i
submit
that
there
is
no
basis
in
this
case
for
a
reversal
of
the
sixth
circuit.
the
jury
may
certainly
consider
the
significance
of
the
rights
before
it
as
a
part
of
the
process
of
evaluating
what
damages
to
award.
no
inherent
value
was
sought
or
argued.
and
rule
51
certainly
doesn't
count.
it
is
the
raising
of
such
things
as
improper
causation
instructions
for
the
first
time
in
this
court.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
meaningful
prejudice
or
probability
of
prejudice
that
necessitates
a
remand
for
any
purposes
and
i
would
ask
the
sixth
circuit
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
