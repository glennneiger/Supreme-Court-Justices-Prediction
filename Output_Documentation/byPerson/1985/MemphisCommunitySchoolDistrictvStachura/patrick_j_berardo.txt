mr.
patrick
j.
berardo
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
urge
the
court
in
this
case
to
affirm
the
rule
of
carey
versus
piphus.
in
every
1983
case,
except
where
nominal
damages
are
awarded,
litigants
be
required
to
prove
their
actual
damages;
that
is
to
say
there
are
no
presumed
or
per
se
damages
in
the
absence
of
proofs.
the
trial
court
and
the
sixth
circuit
seem
to
indicate
in
their
opinions
concerning
this
case,
that
carey
would
permit...
excuse
me,
that
carey
applies
only
in
the
case
of
denial
of
procedural
due
process,
that
it
doesn't
apply
where
substantive
due
process
may
have
been
involved.
we
think
that
there
is
no
reason
for
that
distinction.
mr.
patrick
j.
berardo
justice
stevens,
we
think
that
emotional
distress
damages
are
recoverable
as
an
element
of
actual
damages
in
any
1983
case
for
any
constitutional
deprivation.
mr.
patrick
j.
berardo
including
this
one.
mr.
patrick
j.
berardo
including
a
case
like
carey
against
piphus--
mr.
patrick
j.
berardo
--if
proofs
had
been
made
that
the
actions
taken
in
that
case
had
caused
the
litigants
emotional
distress.
1983
and
we
think
carey
allow
the
court
to
instruct
the
jury
that
actual
damages
may
be
awarded
and
that
if
actual
damages
are
found
that
punitive
damages
may
also
be
awarded.
likewise,
if
there
are
no
actual
damages
and
a
jury
finds
that
nominal
damages
may
be
awarded
to
a
litigant
in
a
1983
action,
then
punitive
damages
may
also
be
awarded.
in
addition,
of
course,
a
matter
that
is
not
before
a
jury,
attorney's
fees
may
be
available
to
the
litigant
under
section
1988.
mr.
patrick
j.
berardo
justice
rehnquist,
our
position
throughout,
and
i
think
the
instructions
of
the
court
in
this
case,
were
that
punitive
damages
could
not
be
awarded
against
the
school
district.
mr.
patrick
j.
berardo
because
of
the
city
of
newport.
however,
it
is
our
position
that
the
instructions
given,
which
was
the
basis
for
this
court's
grant
of
certiorari,
in
effect
allows
the
jury
to
award
a
punitive
award
against
the
school
district
in
violation
of
carey,
newport,
and
other
precedents.
mr.
patrick
j.
berardo
the
instruction
involved
here
allowed
the
jury
to
consider
the
intrinsic
value
of
the
constitutional
rights
that
were
defied.
your
honor,
my
next
point
in
my
argument
was
to
get
to
the
sequence
of
the
instructions.
mr.
patrick
j.
berardo
and
that
will
explain
your
question.
mr.
patrick
j.
berardo
first,
the
jury
was
authorized
to
award
actual
damages,
being
admonished
not
to
consider
speculative
damages.
then
the
jury
was
authorized,
if
they
found
no
actual
damages,
to
award
nominal
damages
and
in
both
cases
to
award
punitive
damages.
after
having
been
instructed
on
damages
in
that
manner,
the
jury
was
then
instructed
that
it
could
award
damages
for
the
intrinsic
value
of
the
constitutional
rights,
taking
into
account
the
importance
of
the
right
in
the
history
of
our
country
and
the
importance
of
the
right
in
the
context
of
the
activities
in
which
the
plaintiff
was
involved
at
the
time
of
the
deprivation.
sequentially,
and
because
the
jury
has
already
been
admonished
not
to
award
punitive
damages
against
a
municipal
corporation
prior
to
receiving
the
intrinsic
value
instruction,
it
is
then
permitted
to
look
at
the
intrinsic
value
and
award
damages
against
the
board
of
education
for
the
intrinsic
value
of
the
right
in
the
absence
of
any
proof
that
there
were
damages
that
flowed
from
what
the
board
of
education
did
or
that
the
intrinsic
value
is
involved
at
all.
i
think
in
that
way,
by
viewing
the
instructions
as
a
whole
and
looking
at
the
sequence,
it
can
be
seen
that
the
instruction
is
extremely
prejudicial,
first
of
all,
to
the
board
of
education,
but,
secondly,
to
the
rest
of
the
defendants
in
the
case.
the
reason
it
is
so
prejudicial
is
because
as
to
the
rest
of
the
defendants,
they
have
already
been
considered
in
light
of
the
punitive
damages
instruction
and
the
additional
inherent
value
instruction
allows
a
multiplier
effect
after
punitive
damages
have
already
been
considered.
the
objection
to
the
instruction
that
was
given
and
the
instruction
again
is...
the
complaint
of
instruction
is
the
intrinsic
value
instruction
is
that
it
violated
the
rule
of
carey
versus
piphus.
secondly,
that
it
allowed
the
jury
to
speculate
as
to
damages
which
is
a
violation
of
carey
and
other
precedents.
the
speculation
is
i
think
most
troublesome
to
the
defendants
and
petitioners
in
this
case.
how
can
one
measure
the
value
of
the
first
amendment
or
any
procedural
due
process
right?
it
invites
the
jury
to
order
or
prioritize
or
find
a
value
for
really
a
priceless
right.
the
instruction
to
the
jury
itself
indicated
that
damages
for
the
intrinsic
value
of
those
rights
are
very
difficult
to
measure,
but,
in
effect,
that
instruction
told
the
jury
that
the
value
of
those
rights
are
great.
they
were
presumed
by
the
court
to
have
great
value
because
of
the
context
of
the
deprivation.
as
a
result,
in
terms
at
least
of
the
objection
that
was
made
to
the
court,
it
was
quite
clear,
not
only
to
the
court
but
to
plaintiffs
and
defendants
at
trial,
what
the
nature
of
the
objection
to
the
instruction
was.
the
court
responded
on
the
motion
for
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
to
further
objection
concerning
the
instruction,
saying
that
counsel
had
not
requested
the
court
to
segregate
the
damages
between
procedural
and
substantive
deprivation.
we
would
urge
the
court
to
consider
that
it
would
have
made
no
difference
that
procedural
and
substantive
deprivations
were
segregated
for
purposes
of
determining
if
the
award
was
proper.
the
real
distinction
is
whether
intrinsic
value
damages
could
be
segregated
from
actual
damages
for
the
deprivation
of
the
right.
there
are
several
unwarranted
consequences
of
the
instruction.
first,
the
intrinsic
value
instruction
conflicts
with
the
availability
of
nominal
damages.
there
is
just
no
reason
to
give
a
nominal
damage
instruction
if
you
can,
in
the
absence
of
nominal
damages
or
in
the
absence
of
actual
damages,
give
damages
for
the
intrinsic
value
of
these
rights.
it
allows
speculation
by
the
jury
and
it
encourages
plaintiffs
to
look
at
the
value
of
a
constitutional
right
involved
before
they
file
litigation.
in
encourages
some
ordering
of
constitutional
rights
by
value.
secondly,
it
permits
a
multiplier
in
the
context
of...
at
least
in
the
context
of
which--
mr.
patrick
j.
berardo
--yes,
your
honor.
i
think
if
you
read
the
instructions--
mr.
patrick
j.
berardo
--justice
stevens,
even
though
the
instructions
seem
to
indicate
that
there
has
to
be
an
injury,
if
you
will
look
on
page
96
of
the
instructions,
after
nominal
damages
have
been
discussed...
i
am
assuming
that
a
jury
which
has
these
instructions
with
them
in
the
jury
room
deliberating
is
going
through
each
paragraph,
paragraph
by
paragraph,
to
determine
what
they
are
going
to
do
with
these
instructions.
they
have
gone
through
actual
damages,
they
have
gone
through
nominal
damages,
they
have
gone
through
punitive
damages,
and
then
they
find
an
instruction
that
says
if
you
find
plaintiff
has
been
deprived
of
a
constitutional
right.
and,
in
this
particular
instruction,
the
second
full
paragraph
on
page
96--
mr.
patrick
j.
berardo
--that
presumes
an
injury,
your
honor.
we
think
that
violates
carey.
mr.
patrick
j.
berardo
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
j.
berardo
i
think
not.
i
think
that
traditional
tort
recovery
concepts
require
an
injury
to
be
something
other
than
an
abstract
deprivation
of
a
right.
it
is
not
the
deprivation
of
the
right
to--
mr.
patrick
j.
berardo
--then,
your
honor,
i
think
carey
would
require
that
nominal
damages
be
awarded.
mr.
patrick
j.
berardo
however,
damages
as
opposed
to
injury
flow
from
the
expectation
that
the
plaintiff
might
have
had
to
exercise
certain
rights,
including
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
patrick
j.
berardo
i
think--
mr.
patrick
j.
berardo
--mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
there
would
be
no
damages
permitted
for
that
kind
of
injury,
but
there
would
be
damages
permitted
for
pain
and
suffering
and
emotional
stress
under
michigan
law
if
a
constitutional
or
statutory
right
were,
of
course,
involved.
mr.
patrick
j.
berardo
that
is
correct.
michigan
law,
your
honor...
in
memphis
school
district...
this
is
a
rather
confusing
case.
it
is
located
in
the
eastern
district
of
michigan
as
opposed
to
tennessee,
but
in
any
event,
the
law
in
michigan
is
very
simple
on
the
issue
of
tort
liability.
it
is
standard
tort
liability
concepts
that
are
applied
across
the
country,
and,
in
fact,
those
same
tort
liability
concepts
that
prevailed
at
the
time
section
1983
was
drafted.
another
factor
that
flows
from
the
giving
of
this
instruction
is
that
damages
for
procedural
deprivations
might
be
awarded
where
there
is
no
proof
of
actual
damages.
this
violates
both
carey
and
common
sense.
damages
additionally
would
be
allowed
without
regard
to
any
objective
standards
for
determining
what
those
damages
are.
there
is
no
objective
standard
of
which
i
am
aware
to
measure
the
value
of
a
first
amendment
right
or
any
procedural
due
process
right
and
i
think
this
court
has
clearly
stated
in
carey
and
in
other
cases
that--
mr.
patrick
j.
berardo
--i
think,
justice
stevens,
the
answer
to
that
question
depends
on
the
proofs
that
are
put
in
by
the
plaintiff.
assuming
that
the
expectation
of
his
right
to
exercise
freedom
of
religion
was
such
that
it
caused
him
humiliation
in
front
of
his
friends
in
the
community
or
that
it
caused
him
emotional
distress
that
would
be
observable
by
a
third
party--
mr.
patrick
j.
berardo
--then
he
is
entitled
to
nominal
damages.
mr.
patrick
j.
berardo
justice
rehnquist,
we
don't
know
what
the
jury
considered
in
this
case.
we
don't
know
how
deeply
this
award
was
tainted
by
the
instruction.
mr.
patrick
j.
berardo
i
think
you
might
claim
that
this
verdict
was
excessive,
your
honor,
because
it
was
more
than
double
what
plaintiff's
attorney
asked
for
in
his
final
argument.
mr.
patrick
j.
berardo
no.
mr.
patrick
j.
berardo
i
agree,
but
in
view
of
defendant's
counsel
it
is
certainly
an
indication
that
this
award
included
factors
other
than
what
plaintiff's
counsel
at
least
argued
to
the
jury
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial.
i
think
it
is
just
as
likely,
perhaps
even
more
likely
that
in
light
of
this
particular
instruction
that
this
damage
award
did
exceed
what
would
have
been
given
for
actual
damages.
in
this
case,
for
example,
the
plaintiff
was
suspended
with
pay
and
never
lost
a
day's
pay
throughout
the
pendency
of
the
case.
in
fact,
is
still
employed
by
the
school
district.
that
particular
fact
which
was,
indeed,
before
the
jury,
that
he
had
continued
to
be
paid
throughout
the
period
of
the
dispute,
was
apparently
ignored
in
calculating
the
damages.
mr.
patrick
j.
berardo
justice
rehnquist,
he
did
get
very
bad
publicity
the
same
as
a
libel
plaintiff
might
be
expected
to
get,
but
this
wasn't
a
libel
for
a
deformation
case.
it
wasn't
tried
as
one
and
it
wasn't
presented
to
the
jury
as
one
so
that
those
kinds
of
per
se
damages
that
might
be
available
in
that
case
weren't
available
and
weren't
presented
to
the
jury.
mr.
patrick
j.
berardo
i--
mr.
patrick
j.
berardo
--as
a
state
law
case,
i
think
not.
i
think
they
are
entitled
to
immunity
under
state
statute.
mr.
patrick
j.
berardo
i
think
not,
justice
o'connor,
for
the
reason
that
this
court
in
granting
certiorari
failed
to
grant
certiorari
as
to
issue
no.
2
in
our
petition
which
was
more
factually
oriented,
therefore,
i
presume
from
the
court's
action
on
our
petition
that
the
facts
in
this
case
are
settled
and
we
are
only
talking
now
about
damages
and
the
proper
calculation
of
damages.
at
this
juncture
then
it
would
be
appropriate
for
me
to
say
that
we
think
that
should
be
requested
because
of
this
tainted
award
is
that
this
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
sixth
circuit...
excuse
me,
remanded
for
retrial
and
that
the
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit
be
overruled.
thank
you.
mr.
patrick
j.
berardo
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
just
a
couple
of
very
brief
points.
first
of
all,
to
say
the
principal
arguments
here
are
raised
for
the
first
time
belies
the
fact
that
the
arguments
to
the
jury
and
the
entire
presentation
of
this
case
to
the
trial
court
from
defendants'
side
was
aimed
at
attempting
to
limit
the
damages
to
those
that
were
caused
by
the
action
of
the
defendants.
causation
has
been
an
issue
throughout
this
case
and
continues
to
be
the
issue
today.
the
instruction,
we
submit,
does
not
adequately
reflect
the
fact
that
causation
is
the
elementary
principle
of
damages
that
overrides
the
entire
system
of
tort
compensation.
mr.
patrick
j.
berardo
justice
o'connor,
i
think
so.
mr.
patrick
j.
berardo
to
say
speculate
to
me
means
to
permit
the
jury
to
determine
damages
without
relation
to
objective
factors
and
without
relation
to
what
caused
the
damages.
in
fact,
the
instruction
itself
defined
a
violation
of
constitutional
rights
or
a
deprivation
of
constitutional
rights
as
the
injury,
then
went
on
to
allow
damages
to
be
awarded
without
regard
to
either
causation
or
determination
of
actual
injury.
i
think
if
you
read
that
instruction,
you
will
get
that
flavor.
notwithstanding
the
rest
of
the
precautionary
instructions,
the
fact
that
it
is
given
last
in
that
context
would
allow
the
jury
to
award
damages
without
regard
to
actual
injury.
secondly,
to
say
that
carey
versus
piphus
is
not
the
substantive
due
process
case
is
not
entirely
accurate
because
briscoe
in
a
companion
case
had
a
free
speech
claim
concerning
his
earring
and
that,
i
submit,
was
before
the
court
at
the
time
that
was
decided.
the
court
at
that
time
declined
to
say
that
the
rule
didn't
apply
in
substantive
due
process
cases
but
left
the
question
opened
to
be
determined
in
each
individual
circumstance
depending
upon
the
right
involved.
i
think
additionally
it
is
inconsistent
for
counsel
to
argue
that
after
asking
for
an
award...
excuse
me,
after
asking
for
an
instruction
on
damages
that
he
can
then
take
the
position,
either
before
the
jury
or
before
this
court,
that
the
instruction
is
harmless
when,
in
fact,
the
intent
of
the
instruction
was
to
permit
damages
to
be
awarded
and
to
permit
the
jury
to
assess
factors
in
assessing
the
damages
against
the
defendants
that
otherwise
would
not
have
been
assessed.
finally,
proof
of
actual
damages
in
this
case
does
not
cure
the
error
of
this
overbroad
instruction.
it
only
exacerbates
the
error.
thank
you.
