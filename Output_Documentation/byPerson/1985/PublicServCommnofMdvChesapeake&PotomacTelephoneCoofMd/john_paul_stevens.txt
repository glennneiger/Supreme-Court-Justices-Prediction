justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
insofar
as
the
proceeding
is
against
the
commission
itself...
and
i
gather
the
individual
commissioners
are
sued
as
well...
do
you
make
any
eleventh
amendment
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
were
they
sued
in
their
individual
capacities?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
were
they?
weren't
they
sued
in
their
official
capacities
as
members
of
the
commission?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i'm
not
asking
that.
i'm
asking,
if
they're
not
sued
in
their
individual
capacity,
but
merely
in
their
official
capacities,
legally
that's
the
same
thing
as
suing
the
commission,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
for
eleventh
amendment
purposes
i
agree
it's
different.
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
statutory
construction
purposes,
wouldn't
you
normally...
you
couldn't
get
damages
against
these
people
individually,
could
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
my
questions
really
are
not
intended
to
raise
the
eleventh
amendment
problem,
but
the
statutory
definition
that
you
referred
to
of
"person"
does
not
include
official
commissions
as
an
example
of
a
commission,
and
there
is
a
separate...
i
mean
of
a
person.
and
there
is
a
separate
statutory
definition
of
the
term
"state
commission",
isn't
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
in
this
case
we
have
kind
of
a
frontal
assault
on
the
fcc's
order
to
the
maryland
commission.
supposing
that
the
utility
just
complained
about
the
application
of
the
order
to
one
set
of
accounts,
say
they
didn't
like
the
way
they
depreciated...
the
commission
required
depreciation
of
the
telephone
poles
in
anne
arundel
county,
but
everything
else
was
all
right.
could
you
bring
a
federal
lawsuit
to
review
the
validity
of
that
kind
of
a
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
mean
it
actually
would
me
a
maryland
commission
would
enter
an
order
on
some
kind
of
a
depreciation
schedule,
and
then
the
utility
would
say,
well,
that
really
doesn't
comply
with
in
all
respects
with
the
preemption
order,
the
depreciation
order
of
the
commission,
the
fcc.
could
you
get
federal
review
of
every
one
of
those
claimed
violations,
claimed
departures
from
the
federal
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
mean
in
a
federal
court,
under
401.
or
do
you
have
to
have
a
wholesale
assault
on
the
order,
as
you
have
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
opposed
to
just
one
application.
to
what
extent
are
we
opening
up
the
federal
courts
to
review
of
particular
applications
of
depreciation
rulings
by
state
commissions,
is
what
i'm
asking.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
no,
i'm
assuming
a
case
in
which
the
commission
says,
we're
trying
to
obey
it,
but
we
think
it
means
something
else
than
you.
you
can
have
fights
over--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it's
in
good
faith,
it's
just
wrong,
under
your
view.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
you
could
go
to
district
court?
that's
my
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
district
court
have
the
jurisdiction
to
entertain
a
claim
that
it's
just
plain
wrong?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
it
does?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
then,
mr.
smith,
if
the
order
had
had
the
label
"rule"
on
it
instead
of
being
called
an
order,
and
then
the
preemption
order
had
been
called
an
interpretation
or
something,
the
same
argument
would
apply?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
fact
that
it's
called
an
order
doesn't
really
make
any
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
would
you
say,
mr.
smith,
to
the
question
i
asked
mr.
stroud?
supposing
there
was
a
fight
about
the
meaning
of
the
order
in
a
particular
application.
would
there
be
district
court
jurisdiction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
interested
in
what
you'd
hope.
what
do
you
think,
would
there
be
jurisdiction
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
found
what...
well,
supposing
that
the
private
party
goes
directly
to
the
federal
court
without
asking
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
jurisdiction
doesn't
depend
on
what
you
find,
does
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
there's
a
dispute
between
one
side
and
the
commission.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
answer
is
there
would
be
federal
jurisdiction?
