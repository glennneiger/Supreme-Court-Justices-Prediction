justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
emge,
with
respect
to
the
case
that
was
just
argued
before
your
case,
will
your
case
be
a
live
case
in
the
event
that
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment
were,
in
the
earlier
case,
was
reversed
and
in
the
case
that
it
was
affirmed?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
would
make
some
sense
if...
perhaps
more
sense
if
it
were
an
argument
advanced
by
the
fcc.
but
here
the
fcc
is
supporting
your
opponents,
are
they
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
your
opponents'
contention
that
if
the
argument
requires
a
great
deal
of
tailoring,
or
the
order
requires
a
great
deal
of
tailoring
or
work
by
the
federal
court,
perhaps
it
ought
not
be
enforced
by
private
parties?
