mr.
jack
d.
smith
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
intended
section
401(d)
of
the
act
as
a
broad
enforcement
mechanism,
available
both
to
parties
injured
by
violations
of
the
act
and
to
the
fcc
itself.
the
section
fairly
bristles
with
the
word
"any".
it
says
that
if
any
person
violates
any
provision
of
the
communications
act,
the
fcc
or
any
party
injured
thereby
may
appeal
to
the
appropriate
district
court
for
enforcement
of
such
order.
yet
petitioner
reads
this
broad
language
very
narrowly,
in
a
manner
that
would
have
this
court
exclude
a
significant
class
of
potential
violators
and
a
large
category
of
fcc
orders.
neither
the
statutory
language,
legal
precedent,
or
common
sense
supports
that
result.
as
to
whether
the
state
of
maryland
is
a
person
under
the
communications
act,
i
don't
think
i
need
to
repeat
my
arguments
made
in
the
brief
as
to
the
broadness
and
inclusiveness
of
section
3(i)
of
the
act.
suffice
it
to
say
that
in
50
years
of
practice
the
fcc
has
never,
at
least
to
my
knowledge,
ruled
that
a
person
does
not
include
a
state
or
a
state
commission.
to
the
contrary,
we
have
always
afforded
state
commissions
and
state
officials
all
the
rights
and
duties
and
obligations
under
the
communications
act
afforded
to
any
other
person.
for
example,
section
301
of
the
communications
act
prohibits
use
of
radio
channels
by
anyone
unless
they're
a
person
duly
authorized
by
the
fcc.
but
states
and
state
agencies
are
among
the
largest
licenseholders
in
the
whole
country.
the
state
of
maryland
alone
holds
well
over
100
fcc
licenses,
licenses
for
police
and
fire
communications,
licenses
for
police
radar,
for
highway
maintenance,
even
licenses
for
the
university
of
maryland
to
run
a
broadcast
station
just
down
the
road.
every
one
of
these
licenses
is
signed
by
a
maryland
state
official,
and
he
binds
the
state
to
abide
by
all
regulations
of
the
fcc
heretofore
and
hereafter
made.
and
this
is
how
it
has
to
be.
otherwise,
our
nationwide
system
of
clear
channel
communications
would
soon
degenerate
into
a
cacophony
of
interference
noises.
the
same
thing
holds
true
for
our
preemption
orders.
the
state
must
be
bound
by
the
fcc's
preemption
orders.
these
orders
are
critical
to
avoid
frustration
of
valid
and
important
federal
goals
by
states
and
state
commissions.
if
enforcement
can't
be
obtained
against
the
states
in
federal
courts,
then
the
fcc's
enforcement
orders
would
lead...
the
fcc's
enforcement
orders
would
not
be
able
to
be
enforced
and
it
would
lead
to
a
situation
where
our
unified
system
would
be
fragmented
by
conflicting
federal
and
state
orders.
justice
stevens
asked,
what
about
the
fact
that
section
<three
one>
[=
3(i)]
contains
a
separate
definition
for
state
commissions.
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact
section
3(i)...
section
3
contains
39
definitions,
all
told.
the
very
next
one
after
section
3(i)
is
corporations,
and
corporations
is
included
and
definitely
named
in
section
3(i).
and
in
fact,
there
is
at
least
a
quarter...
a
quarter
of
the
39
definitions
are
other
examples
of
persons:
carriers,
connecting
carriers,
ship
operators,
radio
officers.
that
is
no
indication
that
states
or
state
commissions
are
not
persons,
because
they're
separately
identified
in
3.
the
commission's
preemption
order
said
that
the
states
were
required
to
abide
by
the
fcc's
rules
allowing
telephone
companies
to
make
their
depreciation
calculations
according
to
the
fcc's
prescriptions.
the
order
was
duly
served
on
all
the
states,
including
the
state
of
maryland.
the
commission
intended
for
it
to
be
immediately
binding.
whether
that
order
is
characterized
procedurally
as
a
rulemaking
or
an
adjudication
doesn't
seem
to
make
any
difference
to
us.
it's
a
final
action.
we
declared
the
obligations
of
all
the
state
commissions,
including
the
state
of
maryland,
and
we
didn't
contemplate
entering
any
other
orders.
as
such,
that
order
is
enforceable
under
section
401(b),
just
as
much
as
that
order
is
reviewable
by
this
court
under
section
402.
petitioner
contends
nevertheless
that,
since
it
was
produced
according
to,
using
rulemaking
proceedings,
that
it
is
not
capable
of
enforcement
under
section
401(b).
but
as
has
already
been
said
and
bears
repeating,
it
is
the
substance
of
what
the
agency
purports
to
do,
not
the
procedures
that
are
used,
that
dictate
reviewability
and
enforceability.
in
recent
years,
the
commission's
workload
has
expanded
greatly.
we
have
all
read
about
it
in
the
papers.
at
the
same
time,
the
pressures
upon
the
government
have
been
to
reduce
expenditures.
mr.
jack
d.
smith
the
order--
mr.
jack
d.
smith
--no,
it
doesn't
as
far
as
we're
concerned.
but
our
practice
is
that
all
those
orders
would
be
called
memorandum
opinion
and
order,
and
we
don't
label
anything
a
rule
per
se
that's
on
a
written
document
like
that.
we
do
have
a
body
of
rules
under
47
cfr,
and
of
course
this
is
not
a
rule;
it's
not
in
47
cfr.
it
was
a
separate
order.
it
was
never
incorporated
as
a
rule
itself,
as
part
of
the
commission
rules.
to
meet
the
challenge
brought
on
by
increased
workload
and
federal
deficits,
the
fcc
and
other
government
agencies
have
increasingly
turned
toward
rulemakings
and
we
have
decreased
our
emphasis
on
procedures
that
are
more
time-consuming
like
adjudications.
there
have
been
numerous
decisions
by
this
court
and
other
courts
that
have
approved
these
efforts,
and
petitioner's
arguments
pleading
for
more
burdensome
requirements
definitely
tend
to
run
contrary
to
that
more
progressive
trend.
nor
is
petitioner
correct
that
our
nationwide
communications
policy
will
be
undermined
if
private
parties
are
allowed
to
seek
enforcement
of
fcc
orders.
the
fcc
is
the
one
responsible
for
maintaining
that
uniformity
and
we
vigorously
disagree
with
that
position.
under
section
401(b),
the
district
court
doesn't
review
the
propriety
of
the
fcc's
orders.
its
effort
is
confined
to
enforcement.
if
there's
any
question
that
arises
about
the
fcc's
policies
or
communications
policy
in
general,
they
are
free
and
have
ample
authority
to
seek
the
views
of
the
fcc
or
to
refer
it
to
us
under
the
doctrine
of
primary
jurisdiction.
they
can
always
solicit
our
views
as
an
amicus
or
an
intervenor.
and
it's
not
true
to
say
that
this
puts
burdens
on
the
fcc
that
are
just
the
same
as
if
we
went
in
ourselves.
it's
much
more
burdensome
to
go
in
and
sustain
a
suit
by
yourself
than
it
is
to
just
file
as
an
intervenor.
in
fact,
many
times
we
can
file
the
same
brief
that
we
filed
in
a
previous
case.
our
experience
has
been
especially
good
in
many
contexts
like
this:
antitrust,
section
401,
and
other
statutes
authorizing
district
court
litigation.
we
have
had
very
good
success
with
this
process.
the
fact
is
that
with
a
shrinking
budget,
we
are
considerably
aided
by
private
enforcement
of
our
actions,
particularly
in
the
instant
case,
where
it
should
be
remembered
that
there
was
no
question
what
the
fcc's
order
was.
we
said
that
you
should
allow
them
to
use
these
methods.
there
was
no
question
that
the
state
disobeyed
it.
they
were
proud
of
it.
they
said,
we
are
not
going
to
follow
it.
so
there's
no
factfinding
for
the
district
court
to
make
there.
it's
a
simple
case
of
enforcement.
lastly,
the
court
doesn't
have
to
get
involved
in
ratemaking,
either.
it's
just
not
true
that
the
district
court
has
to
review
the
rates
set
by
the
state.
in
this
case,
all
we
did
again
was
say
that
you
have
to
abide
by
these
methods.
in
enforcing
that
order,
the
district
court
doesn't
have
to
review
the
rates,
it
doesn't
have
to
review
the
rate
of
return
set
by
the
state,
and
it
doesn't
have
to
review
the
many
other
aspects
of
state
ratemaking.
those
are
issues
for
state
courts.
of
course--
mr.
jack
d.
smith
--i
would
hope
that
we...
in
the
common
carrier
bureau
we
have
an
accounting
and
audits
division,
and
they're
always
free
to
talk
with
people
about
the
meaning
of
the
orders,
and
they
would
work
that
out.
mr.
jack
d.
smith
if
we
found
that
they
were
acting
inconsistent
with
our
decision
and
they
had
violated
the
decision,
yes,
it
would
be
in
the
district
court.
mr.
jack
d.
smith
your
first
question--
mr.
jack
d.
smith
--your
first
question
is
one
if
there
is
ambiguity,
if
there
is
ambiguity
about
whether
they
have
violated
it
or
not.
mr.
jack
d.
smith
the
answer
would
be
it
would
probably
in
the
district
court,
and
the
district
court
would
say:
gee,
this
looks
very
complicated
to
me;
fcc,
i'm
going
to
defer
this
to
you
under
primary
jurisdiction.
mr.
jack
d.
smith
yes,
sir,
exactly.
mr.
jack
d.
smith
exactly.
if
there's
any
confusion
or
there's
a
need
for
clarification,
we
can
always
do
that,
and
we'd
be
happy
to
do
something
like
that.
thank
you
very
much.
