mr.
d.
michael
stroud
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
on
january
6th,
1983,
the
fcc
issued
its
preemption
order
in
this
case.
that
order
was
regularly
made
and
duly
served
on
the
state
commissions
across
this
court...
country,
rather,
including
the
maryland
public
service
commission.
if
the
maryland
public
service
commission
had
implemented
that
order,
it
would
have
had
the
effect
in
maryland
of
raising
local
exchange
rates
by
one
penny
per
day.
however,
instead
of
implementing
that
order,
the
maryland
public
service
commission
defied
that
order.
as
a
result
of
its
defiance,
it
was
necessary
for
the
chesapeake
&
potomac
telephone
company
to
seek
injunctive
relief
in
the
district
court.
that
relief
was
obtained
and
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
district
court
action.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
asserted
two
defenses
to
that
injunction.
first
of
all,
it
claims
that
the
injunction
was
obtained
under
section
401(b)of
the
1934
communications
act
and
that
act
authorizes
the
issuance
of
injunctions
against
persons.
the
maryland
public
service
commission
claimed
that
it
is
not
a
person
within
the
meaning
of
that
statute.
their
other
argument,
justices,
is
that
in
looking
at
section
401(b),
it
talks
about
any
order
of
the
commission.
it
claimed
that
the
order,
the
preemption
order
in
this
case,
was
not
an
order
within
the
meaning
of
section
401(b).
now,
even
though
counsel
has
elected
to
argue
only
one
of
these
defenses,
i
would
like
to
address
both
of
them
today.
i'd
like
to
start
with
them
in
the
order
that
i've
just
identified.
first
of
all
with
respect
to
the
term
"person",
it
is
a
fundamental
principle
of
statutory
construction
that
when
trying
to
determine
the
meaning
of
a
word
we
should
look
to
its
plain
meaning
as
the
word
is
used
in
the
statute.
in
this
particular
case,
the
word
153(i)
of
the
communications
code,
and
that
definition
says:
"the
term
"person"
includes
an
individual,
a
partnership,
an
association,
a
joint
stock
company,
a
trust
or
a
corporation.
"
it
includes
an
individual.
now,
if
you
look
at
the
complaint
which
c&p
filed
with
the
district
court,
it
named
not
only
the
maryland
public
service
commission,
but
it
named
the
individual
commissioners
themselves.
and
indeed,
it
was
on
the
basis
that
they
are
in
fact
individuals
that
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
requirements
of
the
statute
had
been
satisfied.
we
would
ask
this
court
to
do--
mr.
d.
michael
stroud
--yes,
they
can
be,
your
honor.
mr.
d.
michael
stroud
they
were
sued
as
individual
members
of
the
commission,
your
honor.
but
if
you're
asking
whether
or
not
this
implicates
the
eleventh
amendment,
i
would
say
that
it
does
not.
mr.
d.
michael
stroud
it's
not
the
same,
your
honor,
under
the
doctrine
of
ex
parte
young.
what
we
are
saying--
mr.
d.
michael
stroud
--yes.
mr.
d.
michael
stroud
we're
not
seeking
damages,
your
honor.
we're
seeking
injunctive
relief.
and
the
answer
is
no,
i
could
not
get
damages,
and
i
think
if
i
were
suing
them
in
their
individual
capacity
and
looking
for
damages
that
i
would
have
a
severe
eleventh
amendment
problem.
in
this
particular
case,
under
this
court's
holding
in
ex
parte
young,
et
cetera,
i
am
looking
only
for
injunctive
relief,
and
i
am
suing
them
in
their
individual
capacities.
mr.
d.
michael
stroud
you
are
right,
your
honor,
it
does
not
include
them.
however,
it
does
not
exclude
them
as
well.
and
indeed,
there
is
a
separate
section
which
defines
state
commissions.
but
of
course,
that
is
not
an
unusual
problem,
and
if
you
look
at
cases
which
have
been
decided
by
this
court
and
which
i
refer
to
in
my
papers,
including
georgia
v.
evans,
simmons
v.
u.s.,
ohio
v.
helvering,
you
will
see
that
in
a
number,
a
variety
of
different
statutory
contexts,
you
see
the
term
"person"
and
you
have
"state"
defined
separately
somewhere
else
in
that
statute.
in
each
of
the
cases
that
i
have
quoted
to
you,
the
term
"person"
has
been
construed
to
include
state,
even
though
there's
a
separate
definition
in
the
statute
for
the
word
"state".
and
that
of
course
is
case
law
that
is
not
cited
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
now,
petitioner
argues
that...
well,
i'd
like
to,
before
i
go
back
to
get
to
the
policy
questions,
i'd
like
to
make
another
point
with
respect
to
the
definitional
section.
if
you
look
at
the
section
153(i)
and
the
words
that
congress
used,
it
said
in
connection
with
the
definition
of
the
term
"person"
that
"the
definition
includes".
it
didn't
say
that
the
definition
means.
it
says
that
"the
definition
includes".
and
it
suggests
there,
we
contend,
that
the
entities
enumerated
in
the
definition
are
only
illustrative
of
the
types
of
entities
which
could
be
included
there.
and
indeed,
i
believe
the
petitioner
in
this
case
concedes
that
point.
the
only
argument
that
the
petitioner
makes
is
that
there
has
to
be
some
common
denominator,
some
common
thread
between
the
entities
that
are
included
and
those
which
are
sought
to
be
included
within
the
definition.
that
argument,
we
would
suggest,
your
honors,
is
not
an
argument
based
on
law.
in
fact,
the
law
is
different.
it
says
that
there
are
no
hard
and
fast
rules
for
determining
exclusion
or
inclusion,
and
what
you
really
have
to
do
is
to
look
to
the
legislative
context.
if
you
look
at
the
cases
that
i've
just
referred
to...
georgia
v.
evans,
simmons
v.
u.s.,
et
cetera...
you
would
see
that
the
controlling
factor
is
the
legislative
context.
those
statutes
have
exactly
the
same
kinds
of
provisions
which
are
set
forth
in
the
communications
act,
and
this
court
has
consistently
construed
"persons"
to
include
states.
the
policy
arguments
that
petitioner
offers
in
support
if
his
definition
of
the
term
"person"
are
not
persuasive.
first
of
all,
he
argues
that
states
should
be
excluded
from
the
definition
of
the
term
"persons"
because
or
in
deference
to
what
he
claims
to
be
a
federal
policy
of
deference
to
the
states.
we
would
argue,
justices,
that
that
policy
position
is
incorrect,
and
indeed
we
would
cite
the
court
to
the
language
of
the
fourth
circuit
wherein
it
said
that
even
if
the
individual
commissioners
themselves
were
not
persons,
that
the
court
would
nevertheless
find
that
states
were
included
within
the
definition
of
the
term
1934
communications
act.
how
would
that
happen?
well,
if
you
look
back
to
the
legislative
history
of
the
1934
act,
if
you
look
even
to
the
letter
from
president
roosevelt
to
sam
rayburn,
you
see
that
at
that
time
the
communications
policy
in
this
country
was
in
chaos.
the
policy
was
distributed
between
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
between
the
postmaster
general's
office,
and
between
the
radio
commission.
and
in
that
letter
to
congress,
the
president
asked
that
congress
pull
this
all
together
and
put
it
under
one
agency,
so
that
we
could
have
a
unified
communications
policy
and
a
system
of
regulation
in
this
country.
and
indeed,
courts
have
held
that
the
power
of
the
fcc,
the
recipient
of
this
authority
and
the
agency
which
has
the
responsibility
for
implementing
national
and
international
communications
policy,
that
power
extends
to
all
regulatory
actions
necessary
to
ensure
achievement
of
the
commission's
statutory
responsibilities.
and
we
would
argue
that
that
policy
responsibility
would
not
be
achieved
in
indeed
the
states
were
excluded
from
the
definition
of
the
term
"person".
if
such
a
result
occurred,
one
could
readily
imagine
an
event
in
which
the
states
were
evading
lawful
orders
of
the
fcc
and
the
fcc
would
be
powerless
under
the
act
to
seek
enforcement
of
those
orders,
even
the
adjudicatory
kinds
of
orders
to
which
petitioner
refers.
and
we
would
argue
that
if
the
congress
intended
that
after
the
fcc
issued
an
order
against
a
commission
like
the
maryland
commission,
if
congress
intended
that
it
had
to
go
to
anne
arundel
county
or
some
other
circuit
court
in
order
to
get
that
order
enforced,
that
it
would
have
said
so,
and
indeed
it
did
not
say
so.
now,
what
other
language
do
we
have
in
the
statute
to
suggest
what
congress
intended
with
respect
to
the
word
"person",
whether
they
intended
that
states
be
included
within
that
definition.
it
has
been
argued,
and
correctly
so,
that
section
401(b)
is
in
fact
based
upon
section
1612
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
and
there
is
no
real
dispute
about
that.
but
if
you
look
back
at
that
statute,
if
you
look
back
at
section
1612,
you
see
that
the
section
401(b)
was
not
copied
directly
after
that
statutory
section.
everywhere
you
see
the
word
401(b),
under
the
old
1612
that
word
was
"carrier".
so
that
when
401(b)
was
enacted,
the
word
was
changed
from
"carrier"
to
"person".
in
looking
at
the
legislative
history,
there
is
no
explanation
for
this
change.
however,
we
would
argue
that,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
congress
changed
that
word,
and
certainly
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
term
fcc,
and
the
carriers,
that
the
reason
congress
changed
that
word
from
"carriers"
to
"persons"
was
to
make
it
broad
enough
to
include
states
like
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
i
would
now
like
to
turn
to
the
second
argument
that
has
been
made
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
and
that
is
that
the
preemption
order
is
in
fact
not
an
order
within
the
meaning
of
section
<four
oh
one
b@l>
[=
401(b)].
and
the
reason
that
argument
is
advanced
is
because
petitioners
argue
that
an
order
generated
from
an
adjudicatory
proceeding
is
different
than
an
order
generated
in
a
rulemaking
proceeding.
they
argue
that
adjudicatory
orders
are
enforceable,
rulemaking
orders
are
not
enforceable
under
section
401(b).
moreover,
they
argue
that
the
preemption
order
in
this
case
was
a
product
of
a
rulemaking
proceeding
and
therefore
is
not
enforceable.
we
would
argue,
justices,
that
petitioner's
claim
on
this
point
is
totally
without
merit.
moreover,
if
that
position
were
adopted,
prompt
enforcement
of
fcc
orders
would
be
impossible.
and
i
might
also
point
out
at
this
juncture
that
this
is
not
the
position
that
the
petitioners
took
before
the
district
court.
there
seemed
to
be
little
doubt
in
that
proceeding
that
this
was
an
enforceable
order.
this
argument
about
adjudicatory
orders,
enforceable
orders,
is
one
that
was
raised
for
the
first
time
before
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
however,
if
you
look
at
the
statutory
provision
which
is
at
issue
here,
you
see
that
that
statutory
section
does
not
distinguish
between
rulemaking
orders
and
executory
orders.
in
fact,
the
statute
does
contain
an
exception.
it
says
"orders
except
for
the
payment
of
money.
"
and
from
that
we
conclude
that
congress
did
indeed
identify
a
statutory
exception
which
it
wanted
included.
it
did
include,
it
did
not
intend
to
include,
the
exception
which
is
being
argued
for
here
today.
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
of
that
statute
supports
the
petitioner's
position
on
this
point.
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
the
petitioner's
argument
you
see
that
the
primary
basis
for
his
argument
is
in
fact
the
administrative
procedure
act.
with
respect
to
that
act,
we
would
point
out
only
a
couple
of
things.
first
of
all,
it
is
true
that
the
administrative
procedure
act
does
contain
a
definitional
section
and
it
does
contain
a
definition
of
the
word
"order",
and
"orders"
under
that
section
would
exclude
rulemaking
orders.
i
would
point
out,
however,
that
the
administrative
procedure
act
has
no
relevance
of
application
whatsoever
to
the
<nineteen
thirty-four>
[=
1934]
communications
act.
the
administrative
procedure
act
was
passed
more
that
ten
years
after
the
1934
act.
moreover,
if
you
look
at
the
definitions
set
forth
in
the
administrative
procedure
act,
you
see
that
those
definitions
are
expressly
limited
to
the
act
itself.
so
petitioner
in
this
case
has
failed
to
give
this
court,
or
anyone
else
for
that
reason,
any
reason
for
believing
that
you
should
engraft
onto
the
1934
act
definitions
which
were
not
considered
by
congress
until
ten
years
later.
in
addition
to
ignoring
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
and
the
legislative
history,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
has
already...
also
ignored
a
number
of
cases
by
this
court
which
indicates
that
orders
which
are
the
product
of
rulemaking
are
indeed
enforceable.
and
in
that
regard...
this
regard,
i
would
cite
to
the
court
the
case
of
ambassador
v.
u.s.
and
also
cbs
versus
united
states.
now,
with
respect
to
the
cbs
case
i
should
point
out
that
that
decision
was
a
decision
which
was
made
pursuant
to
section
402(a).
but
section
402(a),
of
course,
does
use
the
word
401(b).
therefore,
we
would
argue
that
where
the
same
word
is
used
in
different
parts
of
the
same
statute,
those
words
should
have
the
same
meaning
in
both
places.
and
that
would
suggest
to
you
that
if
an
order
is
an
order
for
purposes
of
402(a),
it
also
should
be
an
order
for
purposes
of
401(b).
ultimately,
though,
after
looking
at
the
statutory
information
that
is
available
and
also
the
precedents
that
exist
in
this
area,
ultimately
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
preemption
order
is
itself
enforceable.
and
in
looking
for
guidance
on
that
question,
we
would
refer
the
court
to
the
cbs
case.
in
that
case,
the
court
held
that
labels
are
not
dispositive,
you
cannot
judge
a
book
by
its
cover.
and
indeed,
i
believe
that's
the
fallacy
that's
implicit
in
counsel's
argument,
and
i
believe
that
was
the
problem
with
the
first
circuit
decision.
indeed,
you
must
look
at
the
substance.
and
if
you
look
at
the
substance,
there
are
certain
things
that
you
should
look
for.
you
should
look
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
order
is
fully
executory,
look
to
see
if
there's
anything
else
that
is
left
to
be
done,
look
to
see
if
that
order
determines
rights,
look
to
see
if
it
was
intended
to
be
binding
on
the
parties
to
whom
it
was
addressed,
look
to
see
if
it
was
served
on
the
persons
who
would
be
affected
by
it.
mr.
d.
michael
stroud
your
honor,
i
am
not
making
the
argument
that
every
order
or
every
piece
of
paper
that
is
denominated
by
the
fcc
as
an
order
need
be
enforced
under
section
401(b).
what
i
am
trying
to
do
is
no
suggest,
as
the
court
did
in
the
cbs
case,
a
standard
of
review,
a
set
of
criteria
which
could
be
used
to
evaluate
in
an
individual
case
whether
or
not
an
order
is
or
is
not
enforceable.
there
may
be
some
orders
which
are
so...
which
are
denominated
as
orders,
but
which
are
so
imprecise
that
they
could
not
be
enforced.
the
order
in
kroeger
v.
stahl,
for
example,
is
exactly
that
kind
of
order,
where
the
fcc
called
something
an
order,
but
it
was
merely
an
authorization
to
conduct
certain
kinds
of
tests.
it
didn't
require
anybody
to
do
anything.
that
type
of
order
perhaps...
in
fact
was
not
and
perhaps
should
not
be
enforced
under
section
401(b).
mr.
d.
michael
stroud
the
review
of
any
order
of
the
fcc,
if
in
fact--
mr.
d.
michael
stroud
--i
could
get
review
of
that
situation
certainly
before
the
<fcc>
[=
fcc].
mr.
d.
michael
stroud
as
opposed
to
one
piece
of
it?
mr.
d.
michael
stroud
justice,
i
would
have
to
say
this,
that
the
fcc's
orders
are
intended
to
be
binding
until
they
are
reviewed
and
reversed,
and
if
indeed
an
order
is
executory
and
meets
all
of
the
criteria
that
i
mentioned
before
and
is
served
on
the
commission
and
it
elects
to
disobey
that
order--
mr.
d.
michael
stroud
--oh,
fine,
okay.
if
that's
the
situation,
then
i
think
what
we
would
try
to
do
would
be
to
get
the
fcc
involved
in
the
process
and
see
if
we
couldn't
work
that
out
before
the
commission.
if,
after
that
process
had
been
concluded,
we
still
were
in
a
position
where
we
felt
that
the
commission
was
not
in
good
faith
compliance
with
the
fcc--
mr.
d.
michael
stroud
--well,
if
it's
just
wrong
i
would
think
that
we
wouldn't
want
to
go
to
district
court
on
that.
i
would
think
we'd
want
to--
mr.
d.
michael
stroud
--well,
if
you
have...
let
me
assume
the
underlying
points
again.
if
you
have
an
fcc
order--
mr.
d.
michael
stroud
--the
commission
is
acting
in
good
faith,
but
we
think
it's
wrong--
mr.
d.
michael
stroud
--and
the
question
is
should
we
get
that
reviewed
in
the
district
court
or--
mr.
d.
michael
stroud
--i
would
think
that
it
does.
mr.
d.
michael
stroud
yes.
now,
in
addition
to
the
case
law
and
the
considerations
that
were
set
forth
in
cbs,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
has
also
raised
certain
policy
considerations,
and
i'd
like
to
address
just
some
of
those
because
i
have
counsel
following
me
who
will
address
others.
but
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
construing
the
term
c&p
request
would
have
the
effect
of
creating
a
private
cause
of
action
not
intended
by
congress,
we
would
argue
that
that
clearly
would
not
be
the
result.
thank
you
very
much.
