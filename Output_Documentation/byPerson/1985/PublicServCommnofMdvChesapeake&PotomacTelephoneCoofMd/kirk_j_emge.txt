mr.
kirk
j.
emge
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
authority
of
the
united
states
district
court
to
issue
a
preliminary
injunction
under
section
401(b)
of
the
communications
act
enforcing
an
fcc
rulemaking
order
on
behalf
of
a
private
party
against
a
state
regulatory
commission.
specifically,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
private
party
can
use
the
fcc
preemption
order
as
a
basis
for
obtaining
an
injunction
from
the
united
states
district
court
which
will
require
a
state
commission
to
use
a
particular
ratemaking
methodology
in
establishing
intrastate
telephone
rates.
our
principle
argument
in
support
of
our
contention
that
the
preemption
order
cannot
be
enforced
by
a
private
party
against
the
maryland
commission
is
that
the
preemption
is
an
fcc
rulemaking
and
not
an
order,
and
that
under
section
401
only
fcc
orders
can
be
enforced
by
private
parties.
mr.
kirk
j.
emge
the
district
court
order
in
our
case
indicates
that
if
the
fourth
circuit
decision
is
reversed
that
the
judgment
would
be
entered
in
favor
of
the
defendants
in
that
case,
which
is
the
maryland
commission.
however,
there
are
numerous
cases
involving
other
matters
than
the
preemption
order
under
section
401
enforcement
proceedings
that
have
just
recently
been
instituted,
and
since
there
is
a
conflict
between
the
first
and
the
fourth
circuits
on
whether
a
private
party
can
enforce
the
preemption...
an
fcc
rulemaking
order...
there
will
be
other
instances
where
the
decision
will
depend
upon
which
circuit
you're
in.
so
although
the
commission's
decision...
the
commission
as
a
defendant
will
have
a
judgment
in
its
favor
in
the
event
the
preceding
case
is
ruled
in
favor
of
the
states,
there
are
still
conflicts
that
will
remain
that
will
arise
in
other
areas.
if
the
court
agrees
that
the
preemption
order
is
not
the
type
of
fcc
decision
that
can
be
enforced
by
a
private
party,
it
would
be
unnecessary
to
address
or
reach
the
broader
question
as
to
whether
a
state
commission
is
a
person
and
to
what
extent
the
state
commission
is
a
person
for
purposes
of
the
communications
act.
under
the
enforcement
scheme
established
by
congress
in
section
401,
the
fcc
has
the
sole
authority
to
enforce
compliance
with
provisions
of
the
act,
and
it's
important
to
note
at
this
point
that
in
the
preemption
order
the
fcc
based
its
decision
on
the
fact
that
it
said
that
section
of
the
communications
act
preempted
inconsistent
state
depreciation
practices.
clearly,
enforcement
of
the
preemption
order
is
nothing
more
than
enforcing
compliance
with
the
act,
and
under
the
enforcement
scheme
established
by
congress
is
section
401
the
<fcc>
[=
fcc]
and
not
private
parties
has
the
sole
authority
to
determine
when
and
if
those
violations,
such
violations,
should
be
enforced.
under
the
enforcement
scheme
in
section
401,
private
parties
can
only
enforce
obedience
to
fcc
orders.
it
is
clear
that
by
limiting
enforcement
under
section
401(b)
to
orders,
congress
clearly
understood
that
there
were
other
types
of
fcc
actions
that
would
not
be
enforceably
by
private
parties
under
that
subsection.
it's
clear
that
there
was
a
distinction,
well
known
distinction,
between
what
constitutes
an
agency
order
and
what
constitutes
a
rule.
congress
chose
to
use
the
word
"order"
with
respect
to
the
type
of
actions
that
could
be
enforced
by
a
private
party.
in
addition,
if
congress
had
intended
private
parties
to
be
able
to
enforce
fcc
rules,
which
are
the
functional
equivalent
of
statutes,
the
provisions
of
section
401(a)
would
have
no
meaning.
the
sole
responsibility,
once
again,
for
enforcing
the
compliance
with
the
act
resides
only
in
the
fcc.
the
respondents
and
their
supporting
amici
curiae
concede
that
not
all
fcc
actions
are
enforceable
under
section
401(b).
for
example,
the
respondent
implies
in
its
brief
that
regulations
and
rules
which
are
sufficiently
general
in
their
terms
and
applicability
may
not
be
enforceable
by
private
parties
under
section
401(b).
they
merely
say...
allege
in
this
case
that
the
court
doesn't
have
to
reach
that
because
of
their
position
that
the
preemption
order
is
not
one
of
those
orders.
but
we
submit
that
if
you
review
the
terms
and
provisions
of
the
preemption
order,
it
clearly
is
a
rule
of
general
applicability
and
is
addressed
to
a
broad
group
of
entities.
they
seem
to
indicate,
the
respondents
that
is,
that
there
is
a
hybrid
action
called
a
rulemaking
order,
and
that
rulemaking
orders
such
as
the
preemption
order
can
be
enforced
by
private
parties
under
section
401(b).
the
first
point
to
be
made
with
respect
to
that
argument
is
that
the
fact
that
the
fcc
calls
the
action
an
order
is
under
this
court's
decision
in
cbs
not
determinative.
it's
the
substance
of
what
the
fcc
has
done,
rather
than
what
it
classifies
its
actions
to
be,
that
controls.
secondly,
if
the
fcc
adopted
a
rule
by
an
order,
it's
clear
that
if
that
action
were
to
be
enforced,
it
would
not
be
the
order
adopting
the
rule
that
would
be
enforced,
it
would
be
the
substance
of
the
rule
that
would
be
enforced
by
the
court.
so
therefore
you
once
again
get
back
to
the
situation
where,
although
the
fcc
has
the
sole
responsibility
to
adopt...
to
enforce
provisions
of
the
communications
act,
a
private
party
under
the
enforcement
scheme
suggested
by
the
respondents
would
also
share
that
responsibility.
in
order
to
preserve
the
enforcement
scheme
that
was
established
by
congress
in
section
401
and
thereby
maintain
the
role
assigned
to
the
fcc
by
the
act,
enforcement
under
section
401(b)
must
be
limited
to
fcc
orders
which
determine
the
specific
rights
and
responsibilities
of
specific
individual
parties
and
are
based
upon
findings
which
take
into
account
specific
facts
associated
with
that
situation.
these
orders,
in
short,
must
be
specific
in
their
requirements
and
self-executing.
by
self-executing,
we
mean
that
in
order
for
a
court
to
enforce
the
fcc
order
there
is
no
further
determination
required
by
the
federal
communications
commission,
for,
as
the
fcc
has
noted
in
its
brief,
under
the
enforcement
scheme
established
by
congress
in
section
401(b),
the
court's
role
in
the
enforcement
of
fcc
orders
is
very
limited.
so
in
order
for
the
federal
court's
role
to
be
limited,
the
order
that
is
sought
to
be
enforced
must
be
very
specific
in
what
it
requires,
it
must
be
directed
to
a
specific
party,
and
must
be
based
upon
specific
facts
that
were
presented
to
the
agency,
not
a
general
pronouncement
of
policy,
agency
policy.
the
preemption
order
is
clearly
not
a
self-executing
fcc
order,
but
rather
is
a
broad
policy
statement
containing
agency
interpretation
of
its
statutory
authority,
and
it
prescribes
conduct
that's
applicable
to
a
broad
class
of
individuals.
it
is
a
quasi-legislative
action,
which
is
the
functional
equivalent
of
the
communications
act.
and
once
again
to
point
out
that
the
fcc's
decision
in
the
preemption
order
was
based
upon
the
fact
that
it
found
that
the
communications
act,
section
220,
preempted
the
states
from
using
inconsistent
practices,
and
that
the
enforcement
of
that
preemption
order
is
no
different
from
enforcing
compliance
with
that
section
of
the
communications
act.
there
are
numerous
policy
considerations
which
underlie
the
enforcement
scheme
that
was
adopted
by
congress
and
which
is
set
forth
in
section
401,
and
the
consideration
of
these
policies
indicates
that
private
enforcement
of
the
preemption
order
is
precluded.
for
example,
if
the
goal
of
promoting
the
development
of
uniform,
nationwide
interstate
policy
permits
the
fcc
to
preempt
inconsistent
state
depreciation
practices,
then
that
policy
also
dictates
that
the
fcc
and
not
private
parties
enforce
the
preemption
order
under
section
401(b).
you
cannot
have
uniformity
absent
the
fcc
determination
that
a
state
ratemaking
order
is
in
violation
of
the
preemption
order.
the
cases
that
have
arisen
in
maine,
in
the
district
courts
of
maine,
louisiana,
and
kentucky,
illustrate
that
the
federal
courts
in
order
to
enforce
the
preemption
order
are
required
to
make
a
detailed
analysis,
conduct
judicial
review
of
a
state
ratemaking
order
to
determine
if
that
state's
order
complies
with
the
fcc
preemption
order.
in
determining...
and
reviewing
a
state
rate
order
involves
a
substantial
amount
of
judgment
to
be
exercised
by
the
reviewing
court,
and
will
result
in
contrary
decisions,
inconsistent
decisions,
in
privately
instituted
enforcement
cases.
the
cases
that
have
arisen
illustrate
clearly
that,
absent
fcc
enforcement
of
the
preemption
order,
there
will
be
inconsistent
implementation
of
that
policy
embodied
in
that
preemption
order.
the
fcc
has
argued
that
the
availability
of
that
agency
to
participate
in
district
court
proceedings
is
sufficient
to
ensure
that
uniformity
will
be
maintained.
however,
it's
obvious
that
the
fcc
may
not
participate
in
each
and
every
case
that's
instituted
under
section
401(b).
it
may
not
be
invited
by
the
parties
or
by
the
district
court
to
make
its
views
known.
consequently,
the
action
of
the
district
court
may
in
fact
be
contrary
to
the
policies
that
the
fcc
has
articulated.
but
more
importantly,
it
deprives
the
fcc
of
its
opportunity
to
choose
the
cases
that
it
believes
should
be
enforced
and
leaves
that
decision
in
the
hands
of
private
parties.
a
specific
case
that's
instituted
by
a
private
party
following
private
interests,
rather
than
the
public
interest
that
the
fcc
is
charged
with
promoting--
mr.
kirk
j.
emge
--well,
the
fcc
is
supporting
the
opponents
in
this
case,
and
i
agree
that
perhaps
if
the
agency
thought
about
maintaining
its
prerogatives
under
the
act,
and
the
prerogative
being
it
has
the
sole
responsibility
for
enforcing
the
provisions
of
the
communications
act,
perhaps
they
would
take
a
different
position.
but
these
cases
arose
and
then
the
fcc
came
in
subsequently
in
order
to
deputize
the
private
party's
enforcement
of
the
preemption
order.
and
even
if
the
fcc
takes
that
position,
i
don't
think
the
communications
act
authorizes
the
fcc
to
send
out
50
separate
private
deputies
to
enforce
an
order
that
it
doesn't
want
to
enforce,
or
may
not
want
to
enforce.
now,
they
argue
that
they
don't
have
the
resources
to
enforce
all
of
these
actions
in
50
states.
well,
i'm
not
really
sure
i
understand
that
argument,
because
in
order
to
maintain
uniformity
they
say
they
can
participate
in
as
many
cases
as
are
instituted.
it's
difficult
to
understand
how
resources
will
be
conserved
when
the
fcc
has
to
intervene
in
proceedings
it
may
not
have
even
chosen
to
start
in
the
first
place.
instead
of
choosing
to
enforce
perhaps
one
or
two
cases,
it
may
find
itself
faced
with
ten
or
15
cases
and
being
an
unwilling
participant
in
these
proceedings
in
order
to
ensure
that
its
policies
are
carried
out.
mr.
kirk
j.
emge
we
have
not
made
an
eleventh
amendment
argument,
and
we're
not
making
one.
we
haven't
made
one
and
we
wouldn't
make
one
now,
because
i
think
the
cases
are
clear,
your
honor,
that
under
younger,
if
you
name
the
individuals
as
defendants,
then
you
avoid
any
eleventh
amendment
possibility
of
problems.
and
although
younger
is
mentioned
in
the
respondent's
brief,
we
have
not
made
any
eleventh
amendment
argument
is
this
case.
in
addition
to
the
conservation
of
resources
of
the
federal
communications
commission
being
a
consideration,
i
think
it's
also
an
appropriate
consideration
to
take
into
account
the
need
to
conserve
the
resources
of
the
federal
courts.
the
fcc
implies
that
because
its
resources
are
somewhat
limited
that
parties
should
rely
upon
the
assets
that
are
available
or
the
resources
that
are
available
to
the
federal
courts,
and
we
don't
think
congress
intended
that,
for
a
number
of
reasons.
one
is
that
there
is,
if
the
fcc
is
required
to
enforce
its
order,
there
is
the
possibility
that
it
may
decide
that
what
was
alleged
to
be
a
violation
doesn't
warrant
enforcement.
so
the
case
may
never
get
to
federal
court.
secondly,
it
requires,
as
i've
indicated
previously,
the
federal
courts
to
delve
into
state
ratemaking
orders,
which
is
a
very
complex
and
complicated
subject.
it
will
require
a
great
deal
of
the
court's
time
to
determine
if
the
preemption
order
is
in
fact
being
violated
by
a
rate
order
of
a
specific
state
commission.
moreover,
if
you
permit
enforcement
of
rules
that
are
developed
in
rulemaking
proceedings
by
private
parties
against
private
parties
who
may
not
have
been
a
party
to
the
agency
proceeding,
the
district
court
may
be
required
to
again
add
additional
procedures
to
ensure
that
the
due
process
rights
of
a
non-party
were
protected.
if
the
fcc
is
required
to
enforce
its
own
orders,
such
procedures
would
not
be
necessary
and
the
court
could
function,
as
congress
had
intended,
in
a
very
narrow
way,
looking
to
see
if
there
was...
the
order
was
regularly
made
and
duly
certified,
limiting
its
inquiry
to
the
matters
of
that
nature.
finally,
by
allowing
the
federal
communications
commission
to
delegate
the
enforcement
to
private
parties,
you
will
end
up
with
a
significant
amount
of
issue
splitting,
cases
being...
part
of
a
rate
case
being
tried
in
a
federal
court,
part
of
a
rate
case
being
decided
in
a
state
court;
consequently
the
resources
of
both
the
parties
and
the
courts
will
not
be
conserved.
for
these
reasons,
we
believe
that
the
decision
of
the
circuit
court
for
the
first
circuit
properly
articulates
the
policies
underlying
the
enforcement
scheme
that
congress
chose
to
adopt
with
respect
to
section
401
of
the
communications
act.
consequently,
we
would
submit
that
the
preemption
order
is
not
an
fcc
order
which
can
be
enforced
by
a
private
party
in
federal
district
court
under
section
401(b).
thank
you.
mr.
kirk
j.
emge
just
briefly,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
respondent
in
its
brief
and
in
the
argument
today
places
a
great
deal
of
reliance
on
the
court's
decision
in
the
cbs
case.
but
i
think,
reading
that
case,
it's
clearly
distinguishable
from
the
case
now
before
the
court.
in
that
case,
the
court
was
concerned
with
whether
an
fcc
action
is
reviewable
and
there
is
a
presumption
that
actions
are
in
fact
reviewable
unless
congress
expressly
states
otherwise,
particularly
in
the
exceptional
circumstances
that
were
before
the
court
in
that
case,
where
if
they
did
not...
if
the
court
did
not
permit
review
of
the
fcc
action,
cbs,
whose
rights
were
clearly
being
injured,
would
have
absolutely
no
remedy.
here
we're
not
talking
about
reviewability.
we're
talking
about
enforceability
and
who
can
enforce
the
act.
i
think
the
policy
considerations
that
we
outlined
in
our
brief
and
i
outlined
earlier
in
my
argument
clearly
distinguish
that
enforcement
question
of
whether
an
order
can
be
enforced
from
the
question
of
whether
an
order
is
subject
to
judicial
review.
contrary...
secondly,
contrary
to
the
fcc's
assertion,
i
think
it's
clear
that
enforcement
of
the
preemption
order
by
private
parties
requires
the
courts
to
review
state
ratemaking
decisions.
if
you
look
at
the
decision
of
the
district
court
in
maine
when
it
tried
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
maine
commission
had
complied
with
the
fcc's
preemption
order,
it
made
findings
with
respect
to
rate
of
return,
rate
design,
as
well
as
depreciation
rates.
there
are
a
large
number
of
interdependent
factors
involved
in
ratemaking.
depreciation
is
only
one
of
them.
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
state
commission
has
complied
with
the
fcc's
order,
courts
have
engaged
in
what
amounts
to
judicial
review
of
state
ratemaking
decisions.
with
respect
to
the
question
that
justice
stevens
asked
mr.
stroud
concerning
whether
you
have
the
situation
where
a
state
does
not
completely
disagree
with
the
fcc's
decision,
but
instead
maybe
there
is
a
question
as
to
whether
it
has
complied
with
one
aspect
of
it,
i
think
the
case
that
arose
in
kentucky
is
the
example
of
that
sort
of
instance,
where
the
state
commission
said:
we
agree
that
the
fcc
can
preempt
us,
our
ratemaking
order
reflects
the
preemption
order.
the
telephone
company
said:
no,
you
haven't
properly
reflected.
they
filed
an
action
in
federal
district
court,
and
the
federal
district
court
is
required
to
review
that
order,
which
the
kentucky
district
court
is
still
doing,
to
determine
if
the
rate
order,
although
the
state
commission
says
we
will
follow
the
fcc,
whether
that
rate
order
is
in
fact
consistent
and
complies
with
the
preemption
order.
although
in
the
case
involving
the
maryland
commission
the
commission's
decision
said,
we
don't
believe
the
fcc
has
the
authority
to
preempt
us
and
on
the
basis
of
that
conclusion
and
the
fact
that
they
didn't
think
the
rates
prescribed
by
the
fcc
were
reasonable
for
intrastate
ratemaking
purposes...
although
that
was
the
basis
of
the
commission's
decision,
once
the
district
court
issued
its
preliminary
injunction
the
problems
associated
with
private
enforcement
of
the
fcc
preemption
order
were
still
present
in
this
case
when
the
commission,
the
maryland
commission,
had
to
decide
how
to
comply
with
the
fcc's
preemption
order,
since
the
order
was
general
in
its
terms
and
did
not...
and
there's
no
determination
by
the
fcc
of
what
constitutes
a
rate
order
that
complies,
the
maryland
commission
had
to
conduct
proceedings
in
which
it
had
to
take
comments
as
to
how
it
should
redefine
its
order
in
order
to
be
in
compliance
with
the
fcc's
preemption
order
and
the
district
court's
injunction.
and
although
the
commission
ultimately
opted
to
adopt
the
telephone
company's
proposals
as
to
what
constituted
compliance,
it
was
done
with
one
dissenting
commissioner
and
there
was
a
significant
amount
of
discussion
as
to
what
constitutes
compliance.
the
problems
are
still
there,
even
in
the
maryland
case.
but
there
are
specific
examples
in
other
jurisdictions
where
the
state
commission
said,
we
will
abide
by
the
fcc's
preemption
order
and
this
is
what
we
think
the
effect
is
in
our
ratemaking
order,
and
the
telephone
company
is
not
satisfied
with
that
and
they
file
suit
in
federal
district
court,
and
then
it's
up
to
the
federal
district
court
to
review
the
rate
order
to
determine
if
it's
in
compliance.
thank
you.
