mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
agree
that
this
case
does
present
a
single
issue.
we
would
state
it
a
little
bit
differently
than
the
government
does,
and
that
is
it
is
whether
a
reasonable
attorneys'
fees
award
against
a
federal
agency
in
a
title
vii
action
may
include
compensation
for
delay
in
payment
between
the
time
services
are
rendered
and
the
time
of
the
award.
the
government
sees
the
entire
case
as
dependent
upon
whether
the
word
vii,
or
perhaps
in
its
legislative
history.
and
not
finding
this
word
anywhere,
petitioners
simply
rely
on
a
series
of
decisions
based
on
early
opinions
of
the
attorney
general
and
codified
not
in
28
u.s.c.
section
2516,
to
the
effect
that,
because
of
sovereign
immunity,
interest
is
not
awardable
against
the
government
in
the
absence
of
a
statute.
the
government
then
equates
any
adjustment
in
fees
to
compensate
for
delay
in
payment
with
interest.
therefore,
according
to
the
government,
no
such
adjustment
may
be
made
in
calculating
either
a
reasonable
attorneys'
fees,
what
constitutes
a
reasonable
fee
under
the
statute,
or
in
calculating
back
pay
which
is
intended
to
make
a
discriminated
against
employee
full
or
whole
for
the
injury
they
have
suffered.
we
take
the
position
and
urge
strongly
that
this
case
may
not
be
decided
by
the
simple
and
mechanical
application
of
this
alleged
no
interest
rule,
nor
by
a
semantic
dispute
over
what
the
word
"interest"
means.
rather,
we
would
urge,
it
requires
an
analysis
of
first
the
reasons
for
and
historical
basis
of
the
vii
and
congress'
intent
in
making
title
vii
applicable
to
the
federal
government
in
1972.
now,
it
must
be
emphasized
that
our
position
comes
from
the
language
of
the
statute
and
congressional
intent,
matters
that
the
government
has
dealt
with
hardly
at
all
in
its
brief
or
today,
but
which
are
determinative,
that
is,
congressional
intent
when
it
passed
the
1972
act.
and
our
position
also
flows
from
an
investigation
of
a
series
of
decisions
on
the
issue
of
interest
and
accounting
for
delays
in
payment
in
making
awards,
particularly
a
series
of
decisions
by
mr.
justice
holmes.
these
decisions
have
been
cited
and
discussed
and
are
in
the
government's
brief,
and
we
call
the
court's
attention
particularly
to
the
boston
sand
and
gravel
versus
united
states
decision,
the
decision
in
standard
oil
versus
united
states,
and
the
decision
it
waite
versus
united
states.
these
decisions
and
justice
holmes'
discussion
of
the
issue
i
think
makes
clear
that
there
is
not
some
absolute
rule
that
the
word
"interest"
must
appear
in
the
statute,
that
the
underlying
purpose
and
intent
of
the
statute
must
be
looked
to
and
can
govern.
further,
what
is
clear...
and
the
government
doesn't
dispute
it
seriously...
is
that
congress'
central
purpose
in
1972
when
it
enacted
the
equal
opportunity
act
and
those
provisions
that
applied
title
vii
to
the
federal
government
was
to
override
any
and
all
sovereign
immunity
barriers
to
federal
employees
getting
precisely
the
same
relief
as
all
other
employees
could
get,
all
other
employees,
whether
employees
of
private
employers
or
state
and
local
governments.
and
we've
set
out
that
legislative
history
in
some
detail
in
our
brief,
and
it
was
discussed
in
some
detail
by
this
court
in
brown
versus
general
services
administration.
indeed,
a
succinct
summary
of
the
background
of
the
statute
can
be
found
in
the
government's
brief
in
brown,
where
there
the
government
pointed
out
that
congress
was
concerned
with
two
aspects
of
sovereign
immunity
and
the
barriers
it
presented
to
federal
employees.
one
was
a
lack
of
any
judicial
remedy
whatsoever,
the
ability
to
get
into
court
in
the
first
place.
but
the
second
problem,
in
the
words
of
the
government's
brief,
was
that
"some
forms
of
relief
were
foreclosed.
"
and
this
concern
came
out
of
extensive
discussions
in
the
hearings
in
the
1971
act.
it
is
discussed
at
great
length
in
the
legislative
reports,
both
the
senate,
the
house,
and
the
conference
committee
reports.
it's
discussed
on
the
floor.
congress
dealt
with
these
two
problems
by,
number
one,
providing
the
clear
right
to
go
into
court
for
the
first
time;
and
by
making
the
actions
against
the
federal
government
once
you
got
into
court
governed
by
precisely
the
same
relief
provisions
and
attorneys'
fees
provisions
that
governed
actions
against
state,
local
government,
and
private
employers.
they
made
it
absolutely
clear
in
the
legislative
history
and
the
discussions
therein
that
their
purpose
was
to
ensure
that
federal
employees
be
treated
with
regard
to
employment
discrimination
claims
precisely
the
same
as
everyone
else.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
no,
your
honor.
i
have
gone
through
this
rather
voluminous
book,
and
i
assume
the
solicitor
general's
office
has,
too,
and
the
word
"interest"
as
far
as
i
know
does
not
appear
there.
the
legislative
history
does...
and
we
cite
it
in
our
brief...
mention
attorneys'
fees.
it
mentions
and
clearly
recognizes
the
fact
that
this
type
of
litigation
tends
to
be
protracted
and
this
creates
burdens
on
the
ability
to
obtain
lawyers
and
to
obtain...
and
for
employees
to
obtain
relief
in
court.
but
there's
no--
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
--discussion
of
interest.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
no,
i've
completed
it.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
certainly
where
it's
provided
for
post-judgment
interest,
and
the
eaja,
the
equal
access
to
justice
act,
is
an
example
where
they
put
in
post-judgment
interest
in
the
statute.
however,
that
act
really
is
not
much
of
a
guide
in
this
case,
because
that
act
doesn't
purport
to
provide
for
full
reasonable
attorneys'
fees.
it
has
a
cap,
a
$75
cap.
so
the
whole
question
of
how
you
calculate
the
fee
to
begin
with
just
doesn't
really
come
into
an
eaja
case.
but
congress
hasn't
always
made
it
so
clear,
and
this
court
has
found
that
it's
not
always
necessary
to
make
it
so
clear.
in
1983,
in
a
unanimous
decision
by
this
court
written
by
justice
marshall,
general
motors
corporation
versus
devex,
which
we
cite
and
quote
in
our
brief,
the
court
discussed
pre-judgment
interest
and
its
function
in
fashioning
an
award
that
was
fully
compensatory
in
a
patent
infringement
case,
and
cited
waite
versus
united
states
as
standing
for
the
proposition,
which
it
does,
that
exactly
that
type
of
relief
is
available
against
the
federal
government
when
it
infringes
a
patent,
even
though
there
is
no
express
provision
in
that
statute
for
interest.
and
the
court
reached
that
conclusion
by
analyzing
the
purpose
of
that
statute
and
what
the
function
of
what
it
calls
pre-judgment
interest
was.
and
clearly,
that
purpose
is
substantially
the
same
as
the
purpose
the
congress
had
when
it
enacted
the
'72
act
making
the
provisions
of
title
vii
applicable
to
the
federal
government.
and
that
was,
quite
simply,
to
provide
the
federal
courts
and
at
the
administrative
level,
because
it
also
enlarged
and
clarified
the
powers
of
the
civil
service
commission,
now
the
eeoc,
and
indeed
the
library
of
congress
by
name,
which
was
sort
of
a
special
status
in
the
act...
at
the
administrative
level,
these
agencies
have
the
power
to
grant
any
relief
necessary
to
fully
recompense
the
employee
for
his
or
her
loss,
both
financial
and
professional.
indeed,
at
the
same
time
congress
was
making
the
statute
apply
to
the
federal
government,
it
was
expanding
the
remedial
provisions
of
title
vii
to
make
clear
that
federal
courts
have
the
power
to
make
an
employee
who
had
suffered
discrimination
completely
whole
for
the
discrimination.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
your
honor,
on--
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
--with
regard...
we
take
the
position...
i
suppose
the
best
way
to
state
it
is,
we
take
the
position
that,
because
our
position
is
it's
intended
to
be
a
total
waiver
of
all
sovereign
immunity
with
regard
to
employment
discrimination
claims,
that
if
post-judgment
interest
is
available
against
private
parties
it
would
be
available
against
the
federal
government.
however,
this
case
does
not
involve
post-judgment
interest.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
under
the
general
statute
that
provides
for
interest
on
a
judgment,
it
would
be.
and
indeed,
we
have
obtained
that
in
some
instances.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
yes,
although
again
i
must
emphasize
this
case
does
not
involve
that.
this
is
on
our
grounds
set
forth
in
our
brief
that
this
is
a
total
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
the
first
argument
really
doesn't
reach
that
issue.
it
would
not
result
in
the
government
being
liable
for
post-judgment
interest.
it
deals
with
the
nature
of
pre-judgment
interest
and
particularly
that
aspect
of
pre-judgment
interest
that
deals
with
compensating
for
the
effects
of
inflation.
one
problem
with
the
government's
position
is
this
simple
equation
of
the
word
"interest"
with
what
was
done
here
by
the
district
court
and
what
is
done
by
many,
virtually
every
court
of
appeals
that
has
dealt
with
the
issue,
at
least
in
cases
involving
other
defendants
besides
the
government.
and
that
is
taking
into
account
the
effect
of
inflation
when
calculating
either
a
reasonable
attorneys'
fees,
as
in
this
case,
or
a
back
pay
award
for
the
direct
benefit
of
the
employee.
and
very
simply,
unless
that
is
taken
into
account
a
reasonable
fee
is
not
being
awarded,
in
the
sense
that
it
is
not
fully
compensatory
for
the
attorney's
work.
in
the
same
way,
if
inflation
is
not
taken...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
your
honor,
the
judge
calls
it
interest,
and
again--
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
--our
position
in
this
particular
case,
although
the
judge
called
it
interest,
it
in
fact
did
not
fully
compensate
for
the
effect
of
inflation.
the
judge
fell...
technically,
the
judge's
award
should
be,
by
my
calculations
based
on
the
formula
we
set
in
our
brief,
should
have
been
in
the
neighborhood
of...
i'm
sorry,
$<ninety-four
hundred>
[=
9400],
so
that--
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
court
can
address
the
issue
of
pre-judgment
interest,
but
i
think
it's
helpful
in
addressing
that
as
to
what
that
involves.
and
it's
the
two
components
that
are
important.
the
government
doesn't
really
address
the
issue
of
what
do
you
do
about
inflation
in
calculating
the
award,
and
pre-judgment
interest
really
has
two
components:
number
one
is
to
account
for
the
loss
in
value
of
money
through
inflation.
the
second
one
is
for
the
loss
of
the
use
of
money,
which
is
more
like
interest
in
the
ordinary
sense.
that's
certainly
more
what
post-judgment
interest
involves,
the
fact
that
someone
owes
you
money
now,
they
aren't
paying
it,
so
you're
compensated
for
the
fact
that
you're
not
allowed
to
use
it.
what
the
courts
have
done
in
saying
that
attorneys'
fees...
and
most
of
the
courts
that
do
this
do
not
talk
about
pre-judgment
interest.
they
say
when
calculating
a
reasonable
attorneys'
fee
you
must
take
into
account
the
delay
in
payment,
because
otherwise
the
attorney
is
not
being
fully
compensated
in
actual
dollar
values
for
the
value
of
his
or
her
work.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
in
most
instances,
the
courts
don't
analyze
it
particularly.
they
make
that
statement,
but
in
most
cases
that
i
am
aware
of
when
the
award
is
adjusted
for
the
delay
in
payment
it
is
essentially
an
adjustment
to
take
care
of
the
loss
in
value
of
money.
certainly,
when
we
present
an
attorneys'
fees
petition
to
a
court
one
of
the
things
that
we
factor
in
is
the
fact
that
the
work
was
done
five
years
ago,
and
if
you
pay...
and
if
the
hourly
rate
five
years
ago
was
$80
an
hour
and
you
pay
$80
an
hour
now,
you
in
fact
are
paying
really
only
$50
an
hour
in
terms
of
the
value
of
the
money.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
yes,
that's
loss
of
value
of
the
money,
and
that
is
an
essential
component
of
the
calculation
that
was
made
here.
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
in
copeland
talked
about.
that's
what
the
other
court
of
appeals
talked
about.
now,
our
first
position
is
that
if
you
don't
at
least
do
that...
and
we
set
out
in
our
brief
at
some
length
the
formulas
and
figures
and
numbers
to
demonstrate...
if
you
don't
at
least
do
that,
you
in
fact
are
not
paying
a
reasonable
attorneys'
fee
because
you
aren't
paying
the
proper
hourly
rate.
it's
just
as
simple
as
that.
now,
whether
if
the
no
judgment
interest
rule
then
says,
well,
you
can
do
that
but
you
can't
then
impose
a
charge
for
loss
of
use
of
the
money,
we
contend
that
theft
is
a
somewhat
different
issue.
now,
we
have
laid
out
in
our
brief
reasons
way
we
think
you
can
also
get
the
value
for
the
loss
of
the
use
of
the
money,
but
we
say
certainly
the
rule
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
you
can
at
least
get
paid
a
reasonable
fee
in
the
sense
that
you're
getting
paid
the
full
value
in
today's
dollars.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
yes.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
the
court
of...
yes,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals'
decision,
if
that
was
the
court's
decision,
would
allow
both
aspects
of
pre-judgment
interest.
and
if
the
court
held
that,
as
your
honor
has
just
stated,
it
would
be...
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
would
be
inconsistent
with
that
holding.
now,
our
position
is
the
court
of
appeals
was
right
completely.
but
we
certainly
would
say
or
hold
that
if
you
don't
calculate
in
inflation
you
haven't
calculated
a
reasonable
attorneys
"fees
in
the
first
instance".
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
yes,
but
the
district
court
judge--
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
--no,
we
do
not
contend
that
if
the
court
reached
that
conclusion
that
we
would
now
be
able
to
go
down
and
get
more
money.
but
we
do
say
that
such
a
result
would
certainly
support
what
the
district
court
did,
because
in
fact,
whatever
it
was
called,
it
did
almost
compensate
us
at
least
for
the
loss
in
value
of
money.
it
fell
slightly
short.
we
might
just
point
out
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
also
concerned
with
the
district
judge's
calculation,
and
indeed
its
order
requires
the
district
judge
to
look
again
at
the
calculation,
because
it
was
concerned
that
the
hourly
rate
it
used
already
contained
a
component
for
loss
of
value
of
money,
and
that
we
shouldn't
get
double
billing
for
this
factor,
which
we
agree
with.
so
no
matter
what
happens...
if
the
court
adopts
the
government's
position,
then
that's
the
end
of
it.
but
if
it
adopts
the
partial
position
that
at
least
loss
in
value
should
be
calculated
in,
this
case
will
go
back
down
to
the
district
court
anyway
to
determine
if
that
calculation
was
properly
made
and
not
double
billed.
let
me
just
say,
mention
what
the
district
court
did,
in
response
to
justice
stevens'
inquiry.
i
don't
believe
the
district
judge
deducted
what
the
client
had
paid
the
attorney
in
terms
of
the
overall
award.
what
the
district
court
said
was,
this
is
the
total
award
for
all
the
services,
your
client
has
paid
you
$3100,
so
you
have
to
pay
the
client
back.
that
was
to
ensure
that
the
lawyer
didn't
get
paid
twice,
once
by
the
client
and
then
once
by
the
defendant.
now,
the
district
court
also
did,
in
part
of
his
overall
calculation,
first
deduct
20
percent,
sort
of
a
reverse
blum
factor,
i
suppose
it
would
best
be
described,
for
quality
of
representation,
and
then
brought
it
back
up
by
30
percent.
the
calculation
got
somewhat
confused,
as
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out.
so
again,
that
will
have
to
be
straightened
out
by
the
district
court
if
the
case
goes
back
to
it.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
district
court
did
say,
if
you
had
had
this
and
put
it
in
a
bank
you
would
have
gotten
ten
percent.
i
was
not
involved
at
the
district
court
level.
i
quite
frankly
do
not
know
where
the
district
court
got
that
figure,
because
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
at
that
time,
the
rate
of
inflation
being
such
as
it
is,
substantially
higher
interest
could
have
been
gotten,
which
would
have
taken
into
account
both
factors.
for
example,
the
prime
rate
goes
up
and
down
with
inflation
because
it
factors
in
both
aspects,
both
the
loss
of
value
and
loss
of
use.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
what
the
district
court...
the
adjustment
that
the
district
court
made
here
came
very
close
but
not
quite
to
compensating
just
for
loss
of
value,
and
it
didn't
in
fact
compensate
at
all
for
loss
of
use
of
the
money.
again,
i
think
by
giving
an
example,
a
couple
of
examples
really
of
the
government's
position
is
right
that
no
adjustment
whatsoever,
no
matter
what
it's
intended
to
compensate
for,
can
be
made
for
delay
in
payment,
congressional
purpose
would
be
totally
thwarted.
that
is,
the
congressional
purpose
of
ensuring
that
a
federal
employee
when
dealing
with
the
specific
area
of
employment
discrimination
would
be
entitled
to
the
same
relief,
the
same
make-whole
relief,
the
same
attorney
fee
relief,
as
anyone
else.
if
one
looks
for
example
at
this
case,
using
this
case
for
an
example,
under
the
government's
position
an
employee
who
worked
for
a
state
government,
a
local
government,
a
private
corporation
would
get
at
attorneys'
fees
award
of
some
around
$9,000,
and
that
would
take
into
account
again
just
the
loss
in
value
because
of
inflation.
a
federal
employee's
award
would
only
be
$<sixty-seven
fifty>
[=
6750].
if
back
pay
were
involved,
again
using
the
example
of
a
state
employee
that
worked
for
a
state
library
that
was
denied
a
promotion
in
1978
like
mr.
shaw
was,
and
then
was
given
an
award
in
1981,
and
the
value
of
that
back
pay,
or
the
back
pay
lost,
in
dollars
was
$5,000,
that
state
employee
would
receive
$7,000
in
actual
back
pay.
and
the
government
itself
takes
that
position
when
it
pursues
state
governments
in
federal
court
under
title
vii.
i
call
the
attention
of
the
court,
if
i
may,
to
a
case
that
is
not
cited
in
our
briefs,
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
versus
erie,
county
of
erie,
at
751
f.
2d
79,
where
the
government
successfully
argued
and
defeated
the
state's
position
that,
since
title
vii
didn't
say
anything
about
interest,
there
could
be
no
pre-judgment
interest
award
in
an
award
of
back
pay
against
it,
either.
and
indeed,
one
of
the
decisions
of
this
court,
the
old
decisions
of
this
court,
that
the
government
cites
in
its
brief
here,
united
states
versus
north
carolina,
stands
for
the
proposition
that
this
no
judgment...
i'm
sorry...
no
interest
rule
applies
to
all
sovereigns,
including
the
state.
well,
the
second
circuit
adopted
the
eeoc's
position
that
when
you
look
to
the
purposes
of
the
statute
and
the
function
of
back
pay,
which
is
to
put
the
person
in
the
same
position
that
they
would
have
been
in
they
had
never
been
discriminated
against,
you
could
not
do
that
unless
you
accounted
for
the
loss
in
value
of
money
because
if
inflation.
if
fact,
pre-judgment
interest
period
in
both
aspects
was
awarded
in
that
case.
again,
if
we
use
that
type
of
an
example
in
this
case
and
just
talk
about
loss
of
value
because
of
inflation,
the
state
employee
would
receive,
in
the
example
i've
given
of
having
been
denied
$5,000
in
back
pay
in
1978,
would
receive
$7,000
in
1981.
mr.
shaw
or
any
other
employee
of
the
library
of
congress
or
any
other
federal
agency
would
only
receive
the
$5,000.
and
ipso
facto,
that
federal
employee
is
not
receiving
the
same
relief
as
any
other
employee.
just,
you
cannot
say
that
$5,000
is
the
same
as
$7,000.
and
again,
congress'
clear
intent...
and
it
comes
but
of
every
aspect
of
the
legislative
history,
the
structure
of
the
statute
itself...
was
to
ensure
that
federal
employees
not
be
in
a
disfavored
position
in
title
vii
actions
that
they
bring.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
thank
you
very
much.
