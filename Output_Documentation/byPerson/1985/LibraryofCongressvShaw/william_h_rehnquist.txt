justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
conceded
all
around
that
in
the
case
of
a
private
defendant
pre-judgment
interest
can
be
recovered
on
attorneys'
fees?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
it
doesn't.
mr.
rothfeld,
harking
back
a
moment
to
post-judgment
interest
on
attorneys'
fees,
does
the...
did
you
say
the
respondent
in
this
case
agrees
that
post-judgment
interest
isn't
available
against
the
government?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
legislative
history
speak
expressly
anywhere
to
pre-judgment
interest
on
attorneys'
fees?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
which
of
the
two
senses
that
you
just
spoke
of
do
they
use
that
term,
"delay
in
payment"?
damages
for
delay
in
getting
the
money,
for
the
loss
of
the
use
of
the
money,
or
damages
because
the
money
is
worth
less
when
you
get
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that's
something
different
in
your
view,
then,
than
simply
loss
of
the
use
of
the
money
for
that
period
of
time?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
we
were
to
agree
with
you
on
the
point
that
a
district
court
may
properly
allow
for
lessening
value
of
the
money--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
would
agree
with
the
government
on
the
proposition
that
there
is
no
interest
or
damages
for
delay
on
attorneys'
fees,
we
would
have
to
reverse
the
court
of
appeals,
would
we
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
the
underlying
statute
in
waite
a
statute
that
required
the
government
to
compensate
for
the
taking
of
a
patent?
