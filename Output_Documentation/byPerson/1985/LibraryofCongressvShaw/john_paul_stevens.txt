mr.
rothfeld,
would
you
comment
to
attorney
general
bell's
memorandum
that
you
opponent
quotes
toward
the
end
of
his
brief?
does
he
take...
do
you
think
he...
he
wouldn't
agree
with
your
view,
i
take
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
at
that
time,
the
department
took
the
position
that
no
interest
would
be
awarded
on
attorneys'
fees
awards?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
i
was
just
curious
to
know
what
the
position
of
the
government
was
when
attorney
general...
when
griffin
bell
was
the
attorney
general.
i
had
the
impression
from
reading
this
that
there'd
probably
been
a
change
in
the
government's
position,
but
maybe
i'm
wrong.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
also
just
clarify,
because
i'm
a
little
hazy
on
it,
what
is
your
position
with
respect
to
post-judgment
interest
on
an
attorneys'
fee
award?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
it's
not
at
issue.
your
position
is
that
such
interest
is
or
is
not--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i'm
talking
about
attorneys'
fee
awards.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
not
available.
can
i
ask
one
other
question
that
troubles
me
about
this
case
that
nobody
mentions
in
the
briefs.
in
judge
oberdorfer's
award
he
deducted
i
think
$3100
because
the
client
had
already
paid
that
amount
to
the
attorney.
do
you
recall
that?
he
said
that
that
should
be
deducted.
that
was
plainly
wrong,
wasn't
it?
why
would
that
be
deducted?
isn't
the...
is
the
attorneys'
fees...
is
there
to
be
no
attorneys'
fees
award
if
the
client
has
already
paid
the
attorney?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so
that
if
he
pays
his
own
attorney,
he's
not
entitled
to
recover
the
fee?
it
just
sounds
crazy
to
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
perhaps
i
shouldn't,
but
i
just
thought
that
perhaps
you
would
have
thought
about
it
and
have
some
comment
that
would
help
me
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
the
government
got
a
$3100
windfall
at
that
point,
let
me
just
put
it
that
way.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
go
back
for
a
moment
to
your
distinction
between
loss
of
use
and
loss
of
value.
the
district
court
computed
the
ten
percent
for
each
of
three
years
entirely
on
loss
of
use,
as
i
read
its
is
that
not
right?
and
he
did
not
take--
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
mean...
may
i
just
interrupt.
does
that
mean
that,
say
there's
a
five
year
piece
of
litigation.
at
the
end
of
the
litigation
the
judge
thinks
that
it
would
be
fairer
to,
say,
award
fees
on
the
basis
of
current
going
rates
in
the
market
for
legal
services,
rather
than
those
that
applied
five
years
ago.
that
would
be
prohibited
by
the
no
interest
rule,
would
you
say?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
any
of
the
no
interest
rule
cases
on
which
you
rely
actually
discuss
the
problem
of
inflation,
as
opposed
to
the
problem
of
loss
of
use
of
the
money?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
sure
that
the
change
in
the
value
of
the
money
is
necessarily
covered
by
the
notion
compensation
for
delay.
it's
compensation
for
change
in
value
instead
of
loss
of
use.
maybe
it
is,
i
don't
know.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just,
one
last
question.
what
is
your
response
to
his
reliance
of
the
patent
case,
devex
against
general
motors?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
the
government
was
the
infringer
in
that
case,
wasn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
devex
was
against
general
motors.
that's
right,
it
was
general
motors.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
the
claims
against
the
government
where
the
government
is
an
infringer
of
a
patent?
is
pre-judgment
interest
awarded
in
those
cases,
do
you
know?
