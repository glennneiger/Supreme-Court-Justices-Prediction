mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
one
narrow
question,
whether
congress
has
waived
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
united
states
to
permit
the
addition
of
pre-judgment
interest
to
title
vii
attorneys'
fee
awards
against
the
federal
government.
in
1979,
respondent
prevailed
in
his
title
vii
action
against
his
employer,
the
library
of
congress.
the
district
court
indicated
at
the
time
that
it
would
award
attorneys'
fee
to
respondent
as
the
prevailing
party,
but
it
postponed
entry
of
an
order
awarding
those
fees,
deciding
to
await
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
a
pending
case,
copeland
versus
marshall,
which
was
expected
to
provide
guidance
on
the
calculation
of
a
reasonable
attorneys'
fee.
the
court
of
appeals
handed
down
its
decision
in
copeland
almost
a
year
later,
in
september
1980.
an
additional
year
then
passed
before
the
district
court,
in
november
of
1981,
issued
an
order
awarding
fees
to
respondent
for
work
that
his
attorney
had
performed
three
years
earlier,
in
1978
and
early
1979.
in
the
part
of
the
order
that
is
specifically
at
issue
here,
the
court
then
added
30
percent
on
top
of
the
basic
fee
award,
representing
10
percent
for
each
year
of
delay
to
compensate
respondent's
attorney
for
the
time
that
had
passed
between
the
date
that
he
completed
his
work
and
the
time
of
the
fee
award.
a
divided
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
this
award
of
what
it
acknowledged
to
be
pre-judgment
interest
on
respondent's
attorneys'
fee.
in
the
court
of
appeals'
view,
the
title
vii
attorneys'
fee
provision
specifically
waives
that
aspect
of
the
government's
sovereign
immunity
that
traditionally
has
shielded
the
united
states
from
liability
for
interest.
the
question
is
this
case
is
whether
that
judgment
was
correct.
in
our
view,
this
issue
is
flatly
resolved
by
the
application
of
one
of
the
oldest
and
most
firmly
settled
principles
covering
the
resolution
of
claims
against
the
united
states,
what
judge
ginsburg
in
her
dissenting
opinion
aptly
called
the
no
interest
rule.
as
it
has
consistently
been
applied,
this
no
interest
rule
provides
that,
even
when
congress
has
explicitly
waived
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
united
states
and
provided
for
the
recovery
of
substantive
claims
against
the
federal
government,
interest
cannot
be
awarded
on
top
of
those
claims
unless
congress
in
addition
affirmatively
considered
the
interest
question
and
expressly
indicated
that
interest
should
be
available.
it
has
never
been
considered
enough
that
the
statutory
language
could
be
read
to
support
an
award
of
interest
or
that
making
interest
available
might
be
consistent
with
the
statutory
purpose.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
pre-judgment
interest
on
the
attorneys'
fee
award
would
be
characterized,
i
think,
either
as
a
component
of
that
award...
pre-judgment
interest
i
think
is
generally
viewed
as
a
part
of
the
damages
and
is
generally
termed
pre-judgment
interest
on
the
damages.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
it
would--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--it
would
be
a
part
of
the
attorneys'
fee.
it
would
be
interest...
it's
somewhat
complicated,
because
the
title
vii
attorneys'
fee
provision
defines
the
attorneys'
fee
as
a
part
of
the
costs,
and
interest
is
generally
not...
pre-judgment
interest
is
generally
not
awarded
on
costs.
but
in
our
view,
the
pre-judgment
interest
would
be
awarded
on
the
attorneys'
fee,
which
would
then
be
awarded
as
an
element
of
the
costs.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
we
acknowledge
that
a
district
court
can
exercise
its
discretion
to
award
pre-judgment
interest
on
attorneys'
fee
in
private
sector
litigation.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
as
a
part
of
the
attorneys'
fee,
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that's
correct,
not
as
a
part
of
the
substantive
back
pay
award,
for
example,
that
a
plaintiff
might
be
entitled
to
get.
so
what
we
think
is
determinative
here
is
this
no
interest
rule
which
applies
specifically
to
suits
against
the
federal
government,
the
sovereign
immunity
rule.
and
this
rule
has
been
applied
with
undiminished
force
for
the
better
part
of
200
years.
early
in
the
nineteenth
century,
it
already
was
the
usual
practice
of
executive
agencies
not
to
pay
interest
on
claims
against
the
united
states
unless
expressly
directed
to
do
so
by
congress.
and
in
the
years
since
then,
this
court
has
repeatedly
applied
the
no
interest
rule
to
bar
claims
for
interest
against
the
united
states
in
literally
dozens
of
decisions.
with
the
exception
of
narrow
situations
that
are
not
applicable
here,
principally
claims
involving
constitutional
takings,
the
court
has
applied
the
no
interest
rule
to
virtually
every
imaginable
setting,
in
cases
involving
pre
and
post-judgment
interest,
cases
involving
liquidated
claims
and
unliquidated
claims,
cases
involving
statutes
and
contracts.
it
has
even
applied
the
no
interest
rule
without
hesitation
in
cases
in
which
the
statutory
language
directed
the
united
states
to
pay
just
compensation
or
full
equitable
relief,
or
other
language
that
undoubtedly
would
make
a
private
party
liable
for
interest
in
the
same
circumstances.
given
all
this,
the
rule
is
considerably
more
than
a
simple
canon
of
construction.
as
a
principle
that
has
been
applied
consistently
by
this
court
and
by
the
lower
courts
and
by
executive
agencies
for
well
over
a
century,
the
rule
has
taken
on
an
institutional
significance
as
something
that
tells
congress
what
it
must
do
when
it
thinks
it
appropriate
to
make
interest
available
against
the
federal
government.
there
is
little
doubt
that
congress
is
aware
of
the
rule
and
has
legislated
with
the
rule
in
mind.
when
it
has
wanted
interest
to
be
available
against
the
united
states,
congress
has
said
so
expressly,
and
it
has
set
out
the
circumstances
in
which
interest
should
be
paid
with
great
specificity,
setting
out
the
rates
at
which
it
should
be
paid,
what
a
plaintiff
must
do
to
protect
his
right
to
collect,
and
generally
the
conditions
under
which
interest
will
be
awarded.
it
is
against
this
background
of
consistent
interpretation
and
action
by
the
court
and
by
congress
that
respondent's
claim
for
attorneys'
fee
under
title
vii
must
be
evaluated.
the
court
of
appeals
itself
acknowledged
this
background
of
law.
it
recognized
that
the
no
interest
rule
would
be
fully
applicable
here
in
the
absence
of
a
sufficiently
clear
waiver
by
congress.
but
the
court
of
appeals
believed
it
found
such
a
waiver
in
the
title
vii
attorneys'
fee
provision.
that's
41
u.s.c.
2000(e)(5)(k),
which
authorizes
a
court
to
award
an
attorneys'
fee
to
the
prevailing
party
in
title
vii
litigation
as
a
part
of
the
costs,
and
then
goes
on
to
provided
that
the
united
states
shall
be
liable
for
costs
the
same
as
a
private
person.
in
the
court
of
appeals'
view,
this
language,
the
"same
as
a
private
person"
proviso,
must
have
manifested
congress'
clear
intent
to
waive
every
aspect
of
the
government's
sovereign
immunity,
necessarily
including
the
no
interest
rule.
but
in
our
view
there
are
several
fundamental
problems
with
this
analysis.
the
first
and
most
obvious
involves
what
the
court
believed
the
statutory
language
to
mean,
the
"same
as
a
private
person"
proviso.
in
fact,
congress
placed
that
language
in
the
statute
not
in
an
attempt
to
waive
immunity
in
some
complete
way,
but
in
1964,
at
a
time
when
the
united
states
was
not
liable
as
a
title
vii
defendant
at
all.
that
language
was
put
in
the
statute
to
provide
that
the
united
states
would
be
liable
for
attorneys'
fees
in
the
same
circumstances
that
private
plaintiffs
would
be
liable...
excuse
me...
in
which
the
united
states
acted
as
a
plaintiff.
as
this
court,
however,
has
held
time
and
again
in
its
no
interest
rule
decisions,
this
sort
of
threshold
undifferentiated
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
is
simply
not
enough
to
make
the
united
states
liable
for
an
award
of
interest.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think
he
would,
justice
stevens,
and
i
think
actually
in
a
sense
that
supports
our
position
here.
at
the
same
time
that
that
memorandum
was
issued,
the
united
states
took
the
position
in
litigation
in
that
very
year
that
it
was
issued
and
in
the
years
following
while
attorney
general
bell
was
in
office
that
title
vii
plaintiffs
should
not
be
entitled
to
attorneys'
fees
on
their
back
pay
awards
against
the
united
states.
so
i
think
it
must
have
been
manifest
to
the
justice
department
at
the
time
that
the
no
interest
rule
stood
on
a
different
footing,
that
it
was
ancillary
to
the
basic
title
vii
litigation.
and
i
think
that
has
always
been
the
view,
that
the
no
interest
rule
is
something
different
from
the
substantive
recovery
that's
authorized
by
statute.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
it's
my
understanding
that
no
court
had
ever
suggested
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
to
my
knowledge
the
first
suggestion
that
attorneys'
fees
would
be
available,
interest
would
be
available
on
attorneys'
fees
against
the
government,
did
not
occur
until
1980
in
this
copeland
versus
marshall
decision.
so
i
think
that
there
was
no
litigation
about
the
matter
prior
to
that
time,
at
the
time
that
the
memorandum
had
been
issued.
the
only
interest
litigation,
as
i
said,
involved
probably
the
more
important
question
of
whether
plaintiffs
were
entitled
to
their
interest.
and
in
that
area,
the
united
states
consistently
has
taken
the
positions,
successfully
i
should
add,
that
plaintiffs
cannot
obtain
interest
on
their
back
pay
awards.
so
i
think
that
that
has
been
the
consistent
position,
and
emphasizes
the
distinction
that
we
draw
between
interest
and
an
underlying
award.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
so
far
as
post-judgment
interest
is
concerned,
there
must,
again,
be
a
separate
statutory
authorization.
i
think
that
respondent
acknowledges
that
and
i
think
that
that
is
not
at
issue
here.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
on
title
vii
awards,
it
is
not
available.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that's
correct,
in
title
vii
attorneys'
fees
awards.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
must
acknowledge
that
that's
not
an
area
of
the
law
that
i
am
completely
familiar
with.
i
think
that
judge
oberdorfer's
rationale
was
that
the
purpose
of
the
attorneys'
fees
provision
is
to
assure
that
the
title
vii
plaintiff
will
be
able
to
obtain
representation
and
get
into
court.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
again,
that
is
an
issue,
your
honor--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
again--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
hope
that
does
not
reflect
on
the
remainder
of
our
case.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
the
respondent
does
not
explicitly
address
that
question
in
his
brief
and
i
shouldn't
speak
for
him.
as
i
understand
it,
he
attempts
to
distinguish
this
court's
no
interest
rule
cases
on
the
ground
that
they
involve
pre-judgment
interest.
and
i
think
it
may
be
implicit
in
that
that
he
acknowledges
that
post-judgment
interest
is
only
available
when
there's
a
specific
statutory
authority
for
it.
the
usual
approach,
the
usual
distinction
between
pre
and
post-judgment
interest
is
that
pre-judgment
interest
is
awarded
as,
as
i
suggested
to
justice
o'connor,
as
an
element
of
the
damages,
without
a
specific
statutory
authorization,
except
when
the
united
states
is
a
party.
post-judgment
interest
has
always
been
created
as
something
which
is
awarded
separately
by
statute,
and
there
are
a
host
of
federal
statutes
that
address
the
availability,
none
of
which
make
the
united
states
liable
for
post-judgment
interest
on
title
vii
attorneys'
fees.
the
united
states
was
made
liable
as
a
title
vii
defendant
generally
through
the
equal
employment
opportunity
act
of
1972,
which
essentially
extended
the
existing
provisions
of
title
vii
to
suits
against
the
united
states.
it
is
that
1972
enactment,
in
combination
with
the
basic
attorneys'
fees
provision
in
section
2000(e)(5)(k),
that
waives
the
government's
sovereign
immunity
and
makes
it
liable
for
attorneys'
fees
awards
at
all
to
title
vii
plaintiffs
such
as
respondent.
the
fact
that
section
2000(e)(5)(k)
already
contains
the
"same
as
a
private
person"
proviso
upon
which
the
court
of
appeals
primarily
relied
is
a
fortuity
that
really
has
no
application
here.
and
that
language
certainly
was
not
intended
to
waive
the
government's
immunity
in
some
sort
of
unusually
complete
way,
as
the
court
of
appeals
believed.
this
leads
to
a
second
and
more
basic
problem
with
the
court
of
appeals'
approach
as
viewed
against
the
background
of
this
no
interest
rule.
nothing
in
the
equal
employment
opportunity
act
of
1972,
for
that
matter
nothing
in
the
1964
version
of
title
vii,
even
reading
that
version
as
the
court
of
appeals
did,
meets
the
test
of
clarity
that
this
court
has
set
out
in
its
repeated
decisions
applying
this
no
interest
rule.
title
vii
obviously
does
not
mention
interest
on
its
face,
let
alone
set
out
circumstances
in
which
interest
should
be
paid.
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
attorneys'
fees
provision,
either
in
1964
or
the
1972
provisions
that
applied
the
'64
version
to
the
federal
government,
adverts
to
interest
at
all.
and
nothing
in
the
broader
and
more
general
history
or
background
of
title
vii
contains
anything
which
is
helpful
to
respondent
here,
and
that
background
sets
out,
as
i
think
attorney
general
bell
suggested
in
his
memorandum,
that
congress
intended
to
remove
sovereign
immunity
as
a
bar
to
federal
employee
plaintiffs
bringing
their
claims
of
discrimination
to
court,
and
that
background
shows
that
congress
intended
generally
that
the
same
types
of
relief
be
available
to
federal
employee
plaintiffs
as
to
their
private
sector
counterparts.
but
again,
as
this
court
has
consistently
held
in
cases
interpreting
the
no
interest
rule,
whatever
other
forms
of
relief
congress
has
authorized,
the
question
whether
interest
will
be
available
on
that
relief
presents
a
separate
inquiry
to
sovereign
immunity
that
must
be
resolved
by
reference
to
the
no
interest
rule.
it
is
for
this
reason,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
that
the
court
of
appeals
have
uniformly
ruled
that
title
vii
plaintiffs
cannot
obtain
interest
on
their
back
pay
awards
against
the
government.
had
congress
give
any
attention
to
the
question,
it
is
impossible
to
believe
that
it
would
have
chosen
to
provide
more
favorable
treatment
to
title
vii
plaintiffs'
attorneys
than
to
title
<vii>
[=
vii]
plaintiffs
themselves.
finally,
there
is
one
what
might
be
termed
institutional
problem
with
the
court
of
appeals'
analysis.
by
ignoring
the
requirement
of
an
express
statement
of
congressional
intent,
the
court
has
effectively
substituted
its
judgment
for
that
of
congress
in
deciding
when
sovereign
immunity
should
be
waived.
a
look
at
the
body
of
laws
in
which
congress
has
chosen
to
make
interest
available
against
the
united
states
confirms
that
this
is
more
than
a
theoretical
interest.
when
congress
has
made
interest
available,
it
has
set
out
very
precisely
the
terms
on
which
it
should
be
paid.
the
most
recent
of
a
long
line
of
examples
of
this
is
probably
last
year's
amendment
to
the
equal
access
to
justice
act,
a
case
that
already
contained
at
attorneys'
fees
provision
strikingly
similar
to
the
one
in
title
vii.
it
makes
the
united
states
liable
for
fees
to
the
same
extent
as
a
private
person.
congress
nevertheless
found
it
necessary
to
expressly
provide
for
awards
of
post-judgment
interest
under
awards
under
the
equal
access
to
justice
act
and,
in
response
to
suggestions
from
the
comptroller
general,
congress
quite
precisely
limited
the
circumstances
under
which
those
awards
would
be
paid.
it
provided
that
they
would
only
be
available
in
cases
in
which
the
united
states
took
an
unsuccessful
appeal,
and
even
then
only
in
cases...
interest
would
only
run
from
the
date
of
the
fee
award
through
the
day
before
the
date
of
the
court
of
appeals
mandate
of
affirmance.
the
congress
put
these
limitations
in
the
statute
for
a
very
specific
reason.
it
wanted
to
assure
that
interest
awards
under
the
equal
access
to
justice
act
would
be
in
line
with
awards
under
similar
statutes
which
contain
generally
similar
limitations
on
when
interest
is
available
against
the
united
states.
congress
did
that
in
an
attempt
to
prevent
attorneys
benefiting
under
the
equal
access
to
justice
act
and
from
obtaining
unequally
favorable
treatment.
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
which
finds
a
waiver
of
the
no
interest
rule
in
a
case
where
congress
failed
to
address
the
interest
question
and
adopts
an
essentially
ad
hoc
approach
to
the
circumstances
under
which
interest
will
be
paid,
throws
into
uncertainty
an
area
that
congress
obviously
believed
to
be
governed
by
very
precise
rules.
and
the
court's
decision
essentially
has
that
effect
after
the
fact,
by
finding
interest
available
under
statutes
congress
wrote
when
it
knew
the
no
interest
rule
to
be
in
full
force.
in
our
view,
that
sort
of
decision
simply
cannot
be
reconciled
with
over
a
century
of
this
court's
precedents.
thank
you--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
just
a
few
quick
points,
your
honor.
first,
in
response
to
something
that
was
raised
by
justices
o'connor
and
rehnquist
on
the
difference
between
compensation
for
delay
and
compensation
for
use
of
the
money,
neither
this
court's
decision
nor
the
decisions
of
any
lower
court
have
ever
distinguished
between
those
two.
this
no
interest
rule
has
always
applied
to
every
aspect
of
compensation
for
delay.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that's
correct,
your
honor.
to
the
extent
that
that
use
of
current
rates
would
be
designed
to
compensate
for
a
change
in
the
value
of
money
in
the
meantime,
that
would
obviously
be
compensating
for
delay,
and
the
purpose
of
the
no
interest
rule
as
articulated
by
this
court
is
to
prevent
that
type
of
compensation
being
paid
by
the
government.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
a
number
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision
which
address
interest
on
back
pay
awards
under
title
vii
do
discuss
that,
and
saunders
versus
claytor,
a
ninth
circuit
decision,
and
one
from
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
blake
versus
califano,
and
both
conclude
that,
relying
on
this
court's
no
interest
decisions,
that
there
should
be
no
difference
between
the
two,
that
both
are
prevented
by
the
no
interest
rule.
this
court's
decisions
to
my
knowledge
have
not
explicitly
drawn
any
distinction,
but
i
think
that
conclusively
establishes
our
point,
because
they
have
not
inquired
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
some
element
which
is
compensable,
the
court
has
simple
said
no
compensation
for
delay,
period.
i
think
this
relates
to
the
suggestion
that
compensation
for
delay
or
some
type
of
pre-judgment
interest
is
an
element
of
a
reasonable
attorneys'
fees.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
as
the
rule
has
been
treated
by
the
court,
again,
it
hasn't
inquired
as
to
whether
or
not
there
should
be
some
difference
in
treatment.
and
certainly
the
value
of
the
fee
award
will
have
been
adjusted
simply
because
of
delay,
and
always
articulated
by
the
court,
it
is
that
the
united
states
cannot
be
held
liable
for
a
delay
at
all,
and
that
gives
rise
to
the
application
of
the
no
interest
rule.
and
that
clearly,
whether
you're
compensating
for
a
change
in
the
value
of
the
money
or
whatever
other
element
of
the
award
is
premised
on
passage
of
time,
that
compensates
for
delay.
i
think
as
illustration
of
this
is
this
court's
decisions
interpreting
the
term
"just
compensation"
as
used
in
statutes
and
contracts.
i
think
it's
generally
recognized
that
the
term
"just
compensation"
includes
some
type
of
component
for
in
payment.
the
court
has
held
repeatedly
that,
where
constitutional
taking
are
involved,
payment
of
interest
is
constitutionally
compelled.
the
court
has
still
held,
in
statutes
or
contracts
that
require
payment
of
just
compensation,
unless
interest
is
explicitly
referred
to,
interest
is
not
subsumed
within
the
term
"just
compensation".
and
i
think
here
the
same
thing
is
true:
interest
is
not
subsumed
within
the
term
reasonable
attorneys'
fee.
"in
each
case
it's
a
compensation
for
delay
which
is
barred
by
the
rule.
"
a
second
quick
point
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--a
quicker
point
in
response
to
justice
o'connor,
about
whether
or
not
when
the
united
states
has
made
interest
expressly
available
it
has
done
so
in
very
precise
terms.
to
our
knowledge,
it
has
been
quite
precise.
the
waite
case
that
respondent
refers
to
we
discuss
in
our
reply
brief,
and
i
should
and
to
that
only
that
the
court
has
repeatedly
applied
the
no
interest
rule
on
very
strict
terms
in
many
decisions
that
postdate
waite,
and
that
decision
clearly
did
not
signal
a
retreat
from
the
rigid
application
of
the--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--it
was
not
put
in
those
terms,
your
honor.
it
simply
required
a
payment
of
full
and
complete
compensation
for
the
infringement.
but
the
united
states
did
not
contest
liability
for
interest
in
waite,
and
the
court
really
didn't
discuss
the
no
interest
rule
at
all.
one
final
point,
as
to
the
purposes
of
title
vii.
we
acknowledge
that
title
vii
was
designed
to
erase
sovereign
immunity
as
a
barrier
to
employees
entering
federal
court.
but
again,
the
court
has
emphasized
that,
whether
or
not
interest
can
be
added
to
other
relief
that
is
authorized
is
a
separate
ancillary
question
that
must
be
resolved
by
the
application
of
the
no
interest
rule.
i
think
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
purposes
of
title
vii
will
be
entirely
thwarted,
although
even
if
it
were
that
would
be
something
that
should
be
addressed
to
congress.
interest
has
never
been
awarded
outside
of
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
on
title
vii
attorneys'
fees.
even
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
it
has
not
been
awarded,
certainly
not
before
1980...
even
in
1982,
in
a
case
called
parker
versus
lewis,
the
court
of
appeals
acknowledged
that
interest
was
not
available
on
title
vii
attorneys'
fees.
and
yet,
plaintiffs
in
title
vii
actions
against
the
government
have
been
able
to
obtain
representation.
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
statute
simply
cannot
function
without
the
award
of
interest.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
devex
involved
a
private
patent
action,
where
the
no
interest
rule
had
no
application
at
all,
and
obviously
the
court
didn't
discuss
any--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--not
in
the
devex
case.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
the
court
relied
in
that
case
on
waite
simply
for
general
propositions
relating
to
the
availability
of
pre-judgment
interest.
there
was
no
discussion
of--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--generally,
there's...
i
know
that
the
court
of
appeals
have
handled
it...
i'm
afraid
i
can't
provide
you
with
a
citation
now...
that,
in
post-waite
cases,
that
interest
is
not
available
against
the
government.
waite,
interest
obviously
was
awarded,
although
again
the
united
states
didn't
contest
the
availability
of
interest,
so
the
issue
was
conceded
when
it
reached
this
court.
my
understanding
is
generally
interest
is
not
available
against
the
united
states
on
patent
infringement
claims.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
