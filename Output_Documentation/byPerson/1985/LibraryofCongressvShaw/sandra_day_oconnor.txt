mr.
rothfeld,
if
there
were
private
litigants
involved
in
a
case
like
this,
so
we
didn't
have
the
federal
government
issue,
if
some
form
of
pre-judgment
interest
were
sought
as
against
a
private
defendant
employer,
would
it
be
payable
as
part
of
attorneys'
fee,
or
as
a
part
of
damages
in
general,
or
how?
what's
the
theory
of
the
recovery
against
the
private
litigant,
do
you
think?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
if
it
were
a
private
defendant,
in
your
view
then
it
would
be
a
part
of
attorneys'
fee
or
costs
in
any
event?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
as
part
of
the
attorneys'
fee?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
not
as
a
part
of
damages?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
ralston--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--excuse
me.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
didn't
mean
to
cut
off
your
response.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
that
congress
has
usually
used
much
more
express
language
when
it's
provided
for
the
payment
of
interest
than
it
did
in
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
this
statute
allows
the
recovery
of
post-judgment
interest--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--against
the
government,
or
a
private
litigant?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it
available
against
private
parties?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
the
short
answer
is
you
think
it's
recoverable
against
the
government,
post-judgment
interest?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
agree
that
the
enhancement
factor
here
is
the
equivalent
of
the
award
of
interest?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i'm
asking
what
your
position
is.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
answering
the
question
in
this
case,
should
we
address
the
question
of
pre-judgment
interest
or
should
we
address
some
other
question?
