mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
must
admit
that
i
am
somewhat
amazed
by
the
government's
position
that
has
been
articulated
here
today.
essentially
the
government
is
displeased
with
the
findings
of
the
trial
court,
findings
which
the
government
did
not
object
to
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
which
were
affirmed
by
that
court,
and
is
now
offering
for
the
first
time
what
it,
i
presume,
is
proposing
as
evidence
of
facts
that
were
found
to
be
to
the
contrary
before
judge
kennedy.
i
don't
mean
to
dwell
on
this
issue,
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
this
very
contention
was
made
before
judge
kennedy,
and
was
rejected
by
judge
kennedy.
she
found
that
there
was
no
hydrologic
connection
between
the
riverside
property
and
any
nearby
water
body.
that
included
lake
st.
clair,
the
clinton
river,
black
creek,
or
any
of
the
canals
that
drained
into
black
creek.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
it
is
at
the
appendix
to
the
government's
petition
for
certiorari
at
pages
24,
25,
34,
35,
36,
37,
28,
and
31.
there
are
a
series
of
findings
that
she
made
in
her
memorandum
opinion.
she
found
that
although
there
were
wetland
type
plants
growing
on
the
property,
that
their
existence
was
totally
unrelated
to
the
proximity
of
this
particular
piece
of
land
to
any
water
body,
and
moreover
was
completely
unrelated
to
any
inundation
that
may
have
occurred
in
the
past.
and
in
that
respect
she
found
that
the
property
had
been
flooded
on
an
irregular
basis
no
more
than
six
times
in
80
years.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
in
my
opinion,
your
honor,
that
is
very
infrequent
flooding.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
eighty
years.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
pardon
me.
i
thought
i
said
80.
i
meant
to
say
80.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
i
don't
believe
that
is
the
situation
for
the
great
salt
lake,
your
honor.
that
has
been
rising
and
falling
over
long
periods
of
time.
the
government
makes
the
statement
that
this
whole
area
should
be
considered
a
part
of
lake
st.
clair.
i
might
add
that
if
that
is
the
case,
hundreds
if
not
thousands
of
homes
and
businesses
will
also
be
part
of
lake
st.
clair.
i
think
the
argument
just
doesn't
square
with
the
facts.
the
point
is
that
judge
kennedy
made
critical
findings
on
the
relationship
of
this
land
to
any
water
body,
both
surface
and
subsurface.
the
government
maintains
that
she
had
no
evidence
before
her
concerning
surface
conditions.
she
viewed
the
site.
she
was
able
to
see
what
was
going
on,
and
she
made
findings
with
respect
to
the
hydrologic
connection.
there
is
no
suggestion
that
she
limited
her
findings
to
only
an
underwater
connection.
she
did
find
that
the
type
of
soils
that
were
on
the
property
could
not
transmit,
or
it
was
so
impervious
that
water
would
not
move
more
than
50
feet
through
it,
and
on
that
basis
concluded
that
soils
were
not
saturated
because
of
the
relationship
or
proximity
to
any
water
body,
the
nearest
water
body
being
more
than
200
feet
away,
and
that
was
a
canal
that
ultimately
flowed
into
black
creek.
the
point
is,
this
is
an
isolated
wetland.
it
is
an
area
that
is
unconnected
by
either
ground
water
or
surface
water
to
any
water
body.
it
does
possess
poor
drainage,
and
that
is
the
reason
why
the
wetland
type
vegetation
was
growing
there.
this
was
the
basis
of
her
findings,
and
those
findings
were
relied
upon
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
decision.
the
government
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
its
petition
here,
and
i
guess
up
until
the
time
of
its
reply
brief,
was
maintaining
that
any
land
such
as
riverside's
which
possesses
wet
soils
or
any
reason,
and
those
soils
accommodate
the
growth
of
trees
and
other
vegetation
that
are
tolerant
of
wet
conditions
is
a
wetland
which
in
turn
means
it
is
a
navigable
water,
and
regulated
under
the
clean
water
act.
and
this
is
so,
contended
the
government,
irregardless,
irrespective
of
the
relationship
of
this
land
to
a
water
body,
or
any
connection,
either
subsurface
or
surface
connection,
just
as
long
as
there
was
some
other
water
body
in
the
area.
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
rejecting
this
construction
of
the
phrase
"navigable
waters".
wetlands
are
not
mentioned
as
being
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
government
under
the
clean
water
act.
the
definitional
terms
are
contained
in
the
1972
amendments,
and
the
act
applies
to
navigable
waters.
nowhere
in
that
definition
does
the
term
"wetlands"
appear,
and
in
fact
nowhere
in
the
several
thousand
pages
of
legislative
history
surrounding
the
adoption
of
that
act
does
the
word
"wetlands"
or
anything
equivalent
to
it
appear.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
that's
the
original
act,
your
honor.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
congress
in
adopting
the
1972
amendments,
had
something
specific
in
mind.
and
what
it
had
in
mind
was
the
fact
that
prior
efforts
at
water
pollution
control
had
been
restricted
principally
by
agencies
such
as
the
corps
of
engineers,
who
had
refused
to
exercise
jurisdiction
over
any
water
bodies
other
than
waters
that
crossed
state
lines.
as
a
result,
congress
in
1972
sought
to
correct
what
it
perceived
to
be
a
severe
limitation,
and
to
in
essence
follow
cases
decided
by
this
court
concerning
the
definition
of
navigable
waters.
the
legislative
history,
and
in
particular
the
conference
report
to
the
1972
amendments,
is
very
clear
on
saying
what
congress
intended.
it
referred
to
cases
of
this
court,
and
then
stated
that
it
was
intending
to
bring
within
the
clean
water
act's
regulatory
scheme
navigable
waters
that
were
used
in
interstate
commerce,
their
tributaries,
as
long
as
they
were
connected
to
interstate
commerce,
and
then
articulated
that
there
could
either
be
a
connection
through
use
of
those
waters
in
interstate
commerce
or
if
the
waters
ultimately
connected
to
some
other
method
of
interstate
commerce.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
the
act
does
regulate
that,
your
honor,
under
section
402.
if
a
pollutant
ultimately
ends
up
in
a
navigable
water,
it
is
subject
to
regulation
under
section
402
as
a
point
discharge.
what
we
have
here
is
attempting
to
define
the
area
where
that
pollutant
may
come
from
if
it
is
a
wetland,
and
being
a
navigable
water
itself,
in
instances
where
there
is
absolutely
no
connection
between
that
wetland
and
the
water
body.
so
in
answer
to
your
question,
congress
was
concerned,
and
it
is
regulated.
under
the
government's
construction
of
the
act,
something
in
the
neighborhood
of
100
million
acres
of
wetlands
will
be
covered.
we
find
this
to
be
really
not
credible
to
say
that
congress
intended
to
regulate
this
acreage,
which
is
the
size
of
the
state
of
california,
without
ever
having
mentioned
that
fact
in
either
the
act
or
the
legislative
history
when
it
adopted
it
in
1972.
this
is
not
to
say
that
the
clean
water
act
does
not
regulate
wetlands.
the
government's
statement
that
no
wetlands
will
be
regulated
is
simply
incorrect.
for
example,
tidal
wetlands
are
regulated.
they
are
inundated
by
waters
of
the
united
states,
or
navigable
waters,
and
come
within
the
purview
of
the
act.
as
a
result,
the
tidal
wetlands
that
border
the
chesapeake
bay
or
san
francisco
bay
or
tidal
areas
in
florida
come
within
the
regulatory
scheme
of
the
clean
water
act.
in
a
like
fashion,
those
wetlands
that
are
a
part
of
or
are
regularly
inundated
by
lakes
and
rivers
also
are
regulated.
what
is
not
regulated
are
those
types
of
lands
such
as
riverside's
which
have
no
water
connection,
surface
water
connection
to
a
water
body.
congress
did
not
intend
to
bring
that
type
of
area
within
the
regulatory
scheme
of
the
act.
the
government
in
its
briefs,
at
least,
argues
that
in
1977,
congress's
refusal
to
adopt
amendments
that
would
have
severely
restricted
the
definition
of
navigable
waters
should
be
equated
to
a
legislative
endorsement
of
the
corps'
1977
regulations.
first
off,
the
1977
regulations
were
first
promulgated
the
same
day
that
the
bill
that
amended
the
1977
act
was
introduced
into
congress,
and
the
language
as
far
as
these
provisions
were
concerned
did
not
change,
so
unless
congress
is
more
clairvoyant
than
i
believe
it
to
be,
it
didn't
even
know
what
those
77
regulations
were
at
that
time.
they
certainly
didn't
know
what
the
corps
was
contemplating
to
do
in
the
future
in
furtherance
of
those
regulations,
but
more
importantly,
congress
did
not
change
the
definition
of
navigable
waters.
what
it
did
was
to
reject
a
proposed
amendment
that
would
have
placed
the
regulation
of
navigable
waters
back
to
where
it
had
been
prior
to
1972.
in
doing
that,
i
don't
think
that
it
is
appropriate
to
read
into
congress's
inaction
a
positive
finding
in
affirmance
of
the
corps'
conduct
as
manifested
by
its
1977
regulations.
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
a
failure
of
congress
to
act
is
not
tantamount
to
a
manifestation
of
legislative
intent.
and
we
see
no
reason
why
that
doctrine
should
be
departed
from
in
this
particular
instance.
i
would
also
note
that
in
the
legislative
history
to
the
1977
legislative
effort,
congress
again
restated
what
it
thought
it
had
done
in
1972,
and
that
was
to
regulate
not
only
navigable
waters,
but
also
tributaries
of
those
waters
and
intrastate
waters
that
were
navigable
in
fact.
that
is
consistent
with
what
the
legislative
history
surrounding
the
1972
effort
stated,
and
we
see
that
congress
really
was
doing
nothing
different.
it
was
just
restating
what
it
originally
intended,
which
is
to
get
out
from
under
the
restrictive
definitions
of
navigable
waters
that
the
corps
of
engineers
had
administratively
employed
prior
to
1972.
the
government
in
its
briefs
had
argued
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
clean
water
act
was
to
prevent
the
conversion
of
any
wetlands
to
any
other
use.
this
has
been
in
essence
the
foundation
upon
which
it
has
been
urging
a
liberal
construction
of
the
term
navigable
waters.
one
of
the
problems
with
this
contention
is
that
if
the
goal
is
to
prevent
the
conversion
of
wetlands
to
any
other
use,
the
most
common
methods
of
converting
wetlands
to
other
uses
are
not
covered
by
the
act.
for
example,
draining
wetlands,
dredging
or
digging
up
wetlands
as
long
as
you
don't
put
the
dredge
spoils
on
the
wetlands
themselves,
removing
vegetation
from
wetlands,
and
burning
wetlands
are
not
covered.
in
fact,
the
1984
congressional
office
of
technology
assessment
report
on
the
status
of
wetlands
pointed
out
that
since
1950,
only
6
percent
of
the
wetland
conversions
that
had
occurred
occurred
through
urbanization
and
methods
such
as
filling.
the
remaining
94
percent
had
occurred
through
methods
that
were
unregulated
and
are
unregulated
by
the
clean
water
act.
the
point
is
that
the
clean
water
act
was
not
designed
to
be
a
wetland
protection
statute
insofar
as
isolated
areas
are
concerned.
it
was
an
act
designed
to
prevent
the
pollution
of
the
nation's
waters,
and
by
defining
navigable
waters
in
the
act,
congress
intended
to
include
navigable
waters,
non-navigable
tributaries
of
those
waters,
and
non-navigable
portions
of
those
water
bodies.
it
intended
to
eliminate
requirements
that
the
waters
cross
state
lines,
and
it
also
intended
to
abandon
the
requirement
that
the
activity
occur
below
the
ordinary
high
water
line,
and
would
permit
regulation
as
far
as
the
water
body
extended,
in
other
words,
as
far
as
the
surface
waters
flowed.
that
is
what
congress
had
in
mind.
that
is
what
it
stated
it
intended
to
do,
and
in
our
opinion
that
is
what
it
did.
the
court
of
appeals
in
reading
the
act
arrived
at
the
same
conclusion.
it
concluded,
and
i
think
very
reasonably
so,
that
the
term
navigable
waters
as
used
in
the
act
does
not
mean
that
land
that
becomes
wet
and
has
no
relationship
to
any
water
body.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
to
the
extent
it
is
applied
in
a
fashion
that
does
not
require
surface
connection,
yes,
it
is
invalid.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
the
underground
connection,
i
would
say
the
same
thing.
the
surface
water
connection
is
what
the
clean
water
act
was
seeking
to
regulate.
ground
water
is
not
regulated
by
the
clean
water
act.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
as
applied,
your
honor,
yes.
the
court
of
appeals
construed
the
regulations
as
requiring
a
surface
water
connection.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
i
have
to
admit
i
have
some
problems
reading
the
regulations
and
arriving
at
that
conclusion.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
but
i
think
if
the
regulations
are
to
be
saved,
that
type
of
construction
is
required.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
i
would
say
it
is
not
far
away.
0
[generallaughter.]
it
is
200
feet
away,
your
honor,
from
the
nearest
canal.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
i
would
say--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
--if
there
was
a
surface
water
connection,
i
would--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
--pardon
me?
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
the
act
doesn't
regulate
ground
water.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
my
position
would
be
the
same.
it
is
that
congress
in
adopting
this
act
did
not
intend
to
regulate
that
type
of
area.
in
other
words,
an
area
that
was
only
moist
from
a
ground
water
connection.
that
gets
into
a
very
complicated--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
--matter.
congress
has
struggled
with
this,
how
to
regulate
ground
water.
fortunately,
here
we
don't
have
that
factual
situation.
the
findings
are
that
there
was
no
underground
connection.
the
second
problem
from
our
perspective
of
the
government's
position
is
that
once
you
depart
from
the
requirement
of
the
surface
connection,
there
really
is
no
limit
to
how
far
away
from
a
navigable
water
an
area
can
be
and
still
be
treated
as
a
navigable
water
within
the
act.
the
adjacency
requirement
that
is
in
the
regulations
was
originally,
in
our
opinion,
inserted
to
describe
those
areas
that
were
inundated
by
that
water
body.
but
the
government
has
abandoned
that
requirement
in
the
1977
regulations,
and
is
now
moving
away
from
the
water
body,
and
we
just
don't
know
how
far
away
they
intend
to
go.
we
have
heard
in
their
reply
brief
that
all
that
is
necessary
is
some
sort
of
aerial
relationship.
we
don't
know
what
that
is.
one
thing
for
certain,
however,
is
that
that
type
of
aerial
relationship
offers
no
objective
criteria
by
which
a
landowner
can
determine
whether
or
not
his
property
is
subject
to
regulation
under
the
clean
water
act.
given
the--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
--yes.
if
the
relationship
is
something
other
than
a
water
connection,
surface
water
connection.
the
government
in
its
final
pages
of
its
brief
seems
to
say
that
landowners
should
not
be
concerned
about
the
indefiniteness
and
imprecise
nature
and
perhaps
even
difficulties
of
determining
whether
or
not
their
property
is
subject
to
regulation,
because
all
that
is
needed
is
to
engage
in
the
permit
procedure
where
everything
can
be
worked
out
administratively.
in
the
government's
words,
jurisdictional
rules
are
of
limited
utility.
well,
they
may
be
of
limited
utility
from
the
perspective
of
the
corps
of
engineers,
but
it
is
certainly
not
from
a
landowner's
perspective.
the
process
is
time
consuming.
it
is
expensive.
and
it
is
uncertain.
the
permit
most
likely
will
be
denied,
or
if
it
is
granted,
it
will
be
granted
with
conditions
that
require
the
provision
of
what
is
called
mitigation,
and
in
this
instance,
under
the
present
regulations
of
the
corps
and
the
epa,
litigation
is
construed
as
meaning
that
there
should
be
no
net
loss
of
wetland
area.
as
a
result,
if
a
landowner
such
as
riverside
is
to
secure
a
permit
to
fill
ten
acres,
riverside
must
acquire
ten
acres
of
non-wetlands,
convert
them
to
a
wetland,
and
then
give
it
to
the
government.
the
point
is
that
from
the
landowner's
point
of
view,
the
jurisdictional
determination
is
the
critical
determination,
for
once
jurisdiction
attaches,
all
sorts
of
bad
things
begin
to
happen
from
the
landowner's
perspective.
we
think
that
landowners
are
entitled
to
a
boundary
that
not
only
comports
with
the
meaning
of
the
clean
water
act,
and
that
is,
it
is
limited
to
navigable
waters
and
those
areas
that
are
connected
to
them
by
a
surface
water
connection,
but
also
that
the
agencies
implementing
that
act
use
objective
criteria
by
which
that
particular
boundary
can
be
ascertained.
in
this
instance,
the
corps'
regulations
satisfies
neither
requirement.
it
is
out
of
compliance
with
the
act,
and
it
offers
no
objective
criteria
by
which
a
landowner
can
gauge
his
conduct.
i
might
add
finally,
and
this
is
particularly
appropriate
in
the
state
of
michigan,
that
wetlands,
even
isolated
wetlands,
are
not
unregulated.
as
i
pointed
out
earlier,
many
wetlands
are
presently
covered
by
the
clean
water
act.
states
such
as
michigan
also
possess
their
own
wetland
regulatory
schemes.
michigan,
for
example,
has
a
scheme
that
does
regulate
isolated
wetlands
under
the
police
power.
we
think
that
is
where
wetland
regulation
should
be.
we
think
there
is
no
need
for
the
courts
to
construe
the
clean
water
act
in
a
fashion
that
will
basically
amend
the
act
to
be
one
of
wetland
protection
when
that
was
not
congress's
intent.
in
other
words,
there
is
neither
a
need
nor
a
necessity
for
that
type
of
interpretation
to
occur.
unless
there
are
any
further
questions,
that
concludes
my
presentation.
