i
might
say
i
am
glad
we
finally
got
a
map.
it
took
a
long
time.
justice
harry

ms.
oberly,
before
you
sit
down,
could
i
try
to
straighten
out
one
bit
of
confusion?
there
is
a
good
bit
of
discussion
in
your
brief
about
black
creek,
which
is
to
the
east.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
now,
this
property
seems
to
me
from
the
map
to
be
also
adjacent
to
the
clinton
river.
is
that
of
any
significance,
or
is
the
entire
flow
to
the
southeast?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
of
no
significance
at
all.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
was
going
to
say,
it
just
flows
between
the
clinton
river
and
the
lake.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
is
much
like
the
great
salt
lake.
it
is
about
that
frequency,
and
they
are
concerned
about
it
out
in
utah.
