ms.
oberly,
i
am
still...
going
back
to
the
very
beginning
of
the
argument,
i
have
to
confess
some
uncertainty
about
the
whole
case.
i
understood
judge
kennedy
to
find
that
there
was
no
hydrologic
connection
between
this
property
and
any
of
the
navigable
waterways.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
your
map
supposed
to
demonstrate
that
that
basic
point
was
just
dead
wrong?
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
you
say
it
is
an
adjacent...
what
do
you
mean
by
saying
it
is
an
adjacent
wetland?
do
you
mean
that
there
is
a
hydrological
connection?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
nobody
offered
any
evidence
about
surface
flow?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
know
what...
i
am
a
little
bit
like
justice
rehnquist.
i
don't
really
know
what
the
map
proves,
just
looking
at
the
map.
it
proves
that
there
is
a
surface
flow?
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
has
to
drain,
unless
it
sinks
into
the
ground
before
it
flows,
i
suppose.
it
doesn't
sees
to
me
you
necessary
have
surface--
justice
john
paul
stevens
she
said
as
i
understood
it
there
was
no
hydrological
connection.
you
say
that
just
refers
to
subsurface.
it
doesn't
include
surface.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
you
are
asking
us
to
make
a
finding
in
the
first
instance
on
that
point
based
on
a
map.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
because
there
is
a
slope
to
the
property,
necessarily
there
is
a
surface
flow
all
across
that...
it
is
not
that
clear
to
me.
maybe
i
am
stupid.
