ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
riverside's
property
is
wetland
subject
to
the
corps
of
engineers
permit
jurisdiction
under
section
404
of
the
clean
water
act.
the
act
prohibits
the
discharge
of
any
pollutant
into
waters
of
the
united
states
without
a
permit,
and
the
act
further
defines
dredge
and
fill
material
as
a
pollutant.
in
this
case,
riverside
began
filling
without
a
permit
in
1976.
the
corps
issued
a
cease
and
desist
order
which
riverside
ignored.
the
united
states
obtained
a
temporary
restraining
order
from
the
district
court
which
riverside
also
ignored,
and
eventually
the
district
court
held
riverside
in
contempt
of
court,
and
ultimately
the
district
court
at
the
time
judge
kennedy
issued
a
preliminary
injunction
in
joining
riverside
from
further
filling
activity
on
its
property
absent
a
permit
from
the
corps
of
engineers.
riverside
appealed,
but
in
the
meantime
the
regulations
defining
wetlands
had
been
changed,
and
so
the
united
states
asked
that
the
case
be
remanded
to
the
district
court
to
consider
the
effect
of
the
new
regulations
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
and
on
remand,
judge
gilmore,
who
by
this
time
the
case
had
been
reassigned
to,
applied
the
facts
as
found
by
judge
kennedy
in
her
lengthy
trial
to
the
new
regulations,
and
found
again
that
riverside's
property
was
a
wetland
within
the
corps'
jurisdiction,
and
again
entered
a
permanent
injunction
prohibiting
riverside
from
filling
without
a
permit.
on
riverside's
second
appeal,
the
sixth
circuit
reversed.
in
its
initial
opinion,
the
court
based
its
decision
on
its
interpretation
of
the
corps'
revised
regulations.
the
court
interpreted
the
language
in
the
regulations,
which
we
have
quoted
in
our
brief,
that
relates
to
ground
water
saturation
as
being
basically
irrelevant.
the
way
the
court
treated
it
as
irrelevant
was
by...
to
not
quote
it
every
time
the
court
mentioned
the
new
regulation.
instead,
the
court
concluded
that
the
new
regulations
under
which
this
case
was
now
to
be
decided
required
that
any
wetland
vegetation
on
a
piece
of
property
be
caused,
actually
caused
by
what
the
court
of
appeals
called
frequent
flooding,
which
does
not
appear
in
the
regulations
anywhere,
frequent
flooding
from
adjacent
navigable
waters.
essentially
what
the
court
was
doing
in
our
opinion
was
reinstating
a
requirement
in
the
1975
regulations
for
periodic
inundation
that
had
been
eliminated
and
was
the
basis
for
the
united
states'
motion
that
the
case
be
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
reconsideration
under
the
revised
regulations.
even
though
the
government
thought
that
the
court
of
appeals
panel
opinion
had
misinterpreted
the
regulations,
we
also
thought
initially
that
this
was
perhaps
something
the
government
could
have
corrected
administratively
by
simply
issuing
revised
or
clarified
regulations
explaining
that
this
was
never
the
intent
of
the
regulations,
and
that
could
have
solved
the
problem.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
absolutely,
your
honor.
there
is
the
clearest,
and
i
had
planned
to
be
talking
about--
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
--your
honor,
in
all
fairness
to
judge
kennedy
and
the
sixth
circuit,
this
was
one
of
the
first
section
404
cases
ever
tried.
i
don't
think,
again,
in
all
fairness
to
everybody
concerned,
but
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
anybody
knew
exactly
what
they
were
doing.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
i
agree
with
you
completely.
i
think
that
much,
if
not
all
of
what
went
on
before
judge
kennedy
was
irrelevant,
which
was
the
reason
why
when
the
case
first
came
up
on
appeal,
the
united
states
moved
for
the
remand,
from
the
court
of
appeals
back
to
the
district
court,
and
it
was
our
intention
that
these
irrelevancies
which
comprise
about
90
percent
of
the
district
court
record
in
our
view
would
be
just
completely
set
aside.
we
would
start
over
with
a
clean
slate,
try
the
case
properly,
and
we
were
always
certain
as
in
fact
turned
out
to
be
the
case,
that
the
united
states
would
and
should
win
this
case
under
the
new
regulations
as
well
as
under
the
old
ones,
but
our
hope
was
to
sweep
away
what
had
really
diverted
everybody's--
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
--attention
from
the
pertinent
issues
in
the
case.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
there
was
expert
testimony
on
flooding
on
the
surface,
and
there
was
expert
testimony
on
subsurface,
in
other
words
ground
water--
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
--that's
correct.
we
think
that,
a,
the
findings
are
irrelevant
to
our
position,
and
b,
the
findings
are
probably
clearly
erroneous.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
no,
we
are
tired
of
this
case,
and
would
just
as
soon
not
try
it
again.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
no,
your
honor,
i
think
that
it
would
be
sufficient
if
you
take...
and
i
plan
to
talk
about
the
maps
and
the
pictures
in
the
course
of
my
argument.
if
you
take
the
maps
and
the
pictures,
which
are--
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
--another
factor
i
should
mention,
which
is
noted
in
footnote
1
of
our
reply
brief,
is
that
for
several
years
the
exhibits
in
the
case
were
lost,
and
in
all
candor
i
did
not
understand
the
case
until
we
found
the
exhibits,
and
i
had
the
same
physical,
mental
perception
of
the
land
we
were
talking
about
that
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
describes
until
these
exhibits
were
found,
and
once
they
were
found,
i
realized
that
we
were
talking...
that
what
was
involved
here
in
terms
of
both
biological
and
scientific
functions
the
wetlands
perform
and
the
actual
hydrologic
connection
between
this
wetland
and
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
was
simply
not
as
described
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
have
the
exhibits.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
but,
your
honor,
this
map
was...
the
map
that
is
in
our
reply
brief
and
the
picture
to
which
i
will
be
directing
your
attention
was
before
judge
kennedy.
she
also
took
a
view
of
the
property.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
nobody
challenged
its
accuracy.
so
there
was
no
occasion
for
her
to
make
a
finding.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
she
did
make
a
finding,
your
honor,
and
answered,
in
direct
answer
to
your
question,
that
the
property
owned
by
riverside
is
adjacent
to
a
navigable
water
in
the
united
states,
to
wit,
black
creek.
that
finding
is
in
her
opinion,
and
if
is
demonstrated
beyond
any
question
by
the
map
that
is
attached
to
the
back
of
our
reply
brief.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
clearly
not
of
the
court
of
appeals,
because
the
court
of
appeals
has
described
a
totally
different
piece
of
property
than
what
the
physical
evidence
shows
exists.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
no,
your
honor,
i
am
not
asking
you
to
change
the
facts.
i
am
asking
you
to
recognize
that
first
of
all
they
were
handicapped
by
not
having
any
pictures,
second
of
all
the
fact
that
they
did...
they
didn't
find
new
facts,
but
what
they
did
was
apply--
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
--i
think
it
is
more--
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
--no,
your
honor.
i
think
if
that
were
it
and
it
were
only
this
wetland,
and
whether
the
corps
had
jurisdiction
over
it,
we
would
not
have
come
here
on
a
case
with
such
a
confused
record
as
this
one
has.
our
problem
is,
as
a
matter
of
law,
if
you
were
to
affirm
the
sixth
circuit,
we
think
that
there
would
then
be
no
wetlands
regulated
under
the
clean
water
act.
if
you
affirm
the
rationale
and
the
statements
in
the
sixth
circuit's
opinion
and
is
judgment,
we
think
that
all
wetlands,
whether
adjacent
to
navigable
waters
or
not,
would
no
longer
be
within
the
scope
of
regulatory
authority
under
the
clean
water
act,
and
our
concern
goes
far
beyond
the
facts
of
this
case
and
the
relationship
of
this
wetland
to--
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
--i
don't
think
you
have
to,
your
honor,
because
what
we
are
relying
on
are
trial
exhibits
for
you
to
see--
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
--well,
there
were
a
lot
of
excesses
that--
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
--if
the
court
of
appeals--
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
--it
is
a
circuit
that
has
substantial
and
significant
wetlands
in
it,
and
from
the
corps
of
engineers
perspective
would
be
quite
a
damaging
precedent
to
leave
that
opinion
out
there
as
precedent.
if
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
were
also
to
be
vacated,
if
the
whole
case
were
to
be
vacated,
and
we
started
over,
that
would
be
something
else,
but
to
leave
the
sixth
circuit
opinion
there
would
mean
that
no
wetlands
within
the
sixth
circuit
could
be
regulated.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
well,
i
would
be
happy
to--
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
--i
am
happy
to
win
it
on
any
around,
but
once
we--
--i
know,
but
if
you
win
it
on
this
ground,
if
you
win
it
on
this
ground,
you
don't
disturb
the
court
of
appeals'
view
about
a
wetland.
i
think
we
do.
i
think
that
there
are
aspects
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
that
this
court
would
clearly
have
to
say
are
wrong
and
inconsistent
with
the
clean
water
act,
even
to
rule
for
the
government
on
this
narrower
ground.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
that's
correct.
we
claim
that
even
before--
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
--we
claimed
that
even
before
the
map
had
been
found,
and
we
are
happy
to
win
it
that
way
or...
but
it
seemed
to
me
important
once
the
exhibits
had
been
located
for
this
court
to
see
what
we
were
actually
talking
about
in
this
case,
and
to
the
court
of
appeals'
credit,
they
asked
to
see
the
exhibits
at
the
oral
argument
in
the
sixth
circuit,
and
they
were
told
they
had
been
lost,
and
it
wasn't
until
the
government
had
either
petitioned
for
cert
or
cert
had
been
granted
that
someone
in
the
district
court
clerk's
office
found
the
exhibits,
and
that
is
all
quite
unfortunate,
but
it
doesn't
change
the
fact
that
in
our
view,
either
using
these
maps
or
using
the
theory
that
is
basically
set
forth
in
our
petition
and
in
our
opening
brief,
this
is
a
wetland,
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
legal
analysis
was
wrong.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
i
don't
think
that
is
really
quite
a
fair
characterization,
your
honor.
the
corps
uses
adjacency
as...
i
have
called
it
a
sort
of
administrative
presumption
that
a
wetland,
that
is,
again
referring
to
the
map
at
the
back
of
the
reply
brief,
a
wetland
that
is
as
close
to
navigable
waters,
as
adjacent
to
navigable
waters
as
this
one
is,
from
a
scientific
standpoint,
can
be--
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
--yes.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
i
think
you
could
argue
the
case,
and
i
could
answer
the
question
no
and
still
be
correct,
but
in
this
case
we
can
demonstrate
a
connection
between
the
wetland
and
these
navigable
waters,
and
that
is
all
that
this
court
would
have
to
decide.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
yes.
in
this...
for
this
case,
we
are
willing
to
concede
that
there
should
be
a
connection
for
wetland
to
be
treated,
as
adjacent,
but
we
differ
with
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
characterized
the
connection.
the
court
of
appeals
has
a
one-way
connection
only
which
requires
frequent
flooding
from
these
water
bodies
to
this
wetland.
in
our
opinion,
the
connection
can
go
either
direction--
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
--discharge
out.
we
have...
the
record
demonstrates,
as
i
will
explain
in
a
minute,
discharge
out.
it
demonstrates
geographic
proximity
of
a
wetland
to
open
water
bodies
forms
what
we
call
an
aerial
connection,
aerial
in
the
sense
of
geographic
proximity
connection,
where
scientists
and
congress
know
that
a
wetland
this
close
to
open
water
bodies
works
together
with
the
open
water
bodies.
they
each
perform
functions
that
neither
one
would
perform
if
they
were
not
together,
and
so
the
corps
uses
the
adjacency
presumption
as
a
way
of
saying,
if
you
see
this
spatial
relationship,
you
know
that
this
wetland
will
perform
at
least
some
of
the
functions
that
congress
was
concerned
about
in
protecting
this
open
water
bodies.
now,
if
you
had
your
wetland
over
here,
then
that
presumption
wouldn't
make
any
sense,
and
in
those
circumstances
the
corps'
regulations
place
upon
the
corps
the
affirmative
burden
of
demonstrating
an
effect
on
interstate
commerce
before
the
hypothetical
wetland
up
in
this
corner
would
be
regulated
as
"isolated
wetland".
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
unless
we
could
show
that
he
has
got
some
interstate
commerce
activity
going
on
in
his
back
yard,
and
the
corps
would
take
it
upon
itself
to
make
that
showing
itself,
and
not
require
the
back
yard
owner
to
come
in
and
demonstrate
it,
the
absence
of
the
commerce
connection
to
the
corps's
satisfaction.
and
again,
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
is
permeated
with
concern
that
the
government
is
regulating
low
lying
back
yards,
that
it
is
quite
clear
from
this
picture,
from
this
map,
and
from
the
aerial
photograph
that
is
in
the
joint
appendix,
that
this
is
not
a
low
lying
back
yard.
this
is
in
fact
an
adjacent
wetland,
adjacent...
by
adjacent,
i
mean
it
is
immediately
next
to,
abuts,
adjoins,
borders,
whatever
other
adjective
you
might
want
to
use,
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.
the
reason
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
is
dangerous
and
needs
to
be
dealt
with
is
not
this
particular
wetland,
but
because
if
you
accept
the
court
of
appeals'
reasoning
as
to
a
piece
of
property
like
this,
then
the
functions
that
congress
recognized
adjacent
wetlands
perform
for
open
water
bodies
will
never
be
regulated
in
the
sixth
circuit.
and
i
would
like
for
a
moment
to
just
describe
a
few
of
those
functions.
there
are
a
lot
of
them
listed
in
our
brief.
some
of
them
are
quite
technical.
some
of
them
are
beyond
my
scientific
understanding.
but
using
this
map,
i
think
we
can
just
understand
a
few
of
them.
one,
and
one
of
the
most
important,
is
trapping
of
sediment.
again,
using
the
map
at
the
back
of
the
reply
brief,
we
have
developed
areas
to
the
northwest
of
riverside's
property.
as
a
hypothetical,
we
could
suppose
that
the
landowners
in
those
areas
might
water
their
lawns
and
fertilize
their
lawns
with
chemicals,
and
then
it
rains.
those
chemicals
and
the
rainwater
wash
off
in
whatever
direction
the
land
slopes.
the
evidence
in
the
record
is
that
the
land
in
this
area
is
basically
quite
flat,
but
the
slope
is
to
the
southeast.
in
other
words,
it
is
to
lake
st.
clair.
and
therefore
the
chemicals
that
people
put
on
their
lawns
here
to
fertilize
their
lawns
are
going
to
wash
in
this
direction
every
time
it
rains,
but
because
there
is
a
wetland
here
filled
with
wetland
vegetation,
that
vegetation
traps
the
chemicals
and
other
sediment
that
would
otherwise
wash
into
the
open
water
bodies.
and
basically
what
the
wetland
does
is
provide
a
free
water
treatment
plant.
the
chemicals
in
the
sediment
would
otherwise
eventually
find
their
way
into
the
open
water
bodies.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
of
the
black
boundary.
that
is
correct.
this
is
as
an
example.
in
reverse,
other
functions
that
this
wetland
and
other
wetlands
perform
would
be
flood
control.
when
the
waters
of
lake
st.
clair
and
the
great
lakes
flood,
which
happens
more
and
more
often...
i
think
it
is
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
that
lake
levels
on
the
treat
lakes
have
been
rising
over
the
last
decade
or
so...
they
go
this
direction,
to
the
northwest,
across
riverside's
property.
if
the
wetland...
what
the
wetland's
presence
does
is,
the
vegetation
acts
like
a
sponge,
and
it
traps
flood
waters,
and
then
it
releases
them
more
slowly,
like
a
sponge.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
yes,
she
did,
and
she
found
it
wasn't
very
often,
but
it
had
happened
in
a
manner
that
was
basically
consistent
with
the
flood
cycle
on
the
great
lakes,
which
is
an
eight
to
twenty
year
cycle.
the
testimony
in
the
record
was
that
you
don't
have
annual
flooding
on
the
great
lakes.
you
have
an
uneven
eight
to
twenty
year
high
and
low
flood
cycle,
which
she
found
somewhere
between
four
and
six,
depending
on
your
count,
how
you
count
floods
over
eighty
years.
that
is
consistent
with
the
way
the
great
lakes
flood
cycle
works.
the
court
of
appeals
was
unhappy
about
that
"infrequency,
but
since
in
our
view
frequent
flooding
isn't
an
element
of
the
jurisdictional
test
in
any
event,
the
frequency,
doesn't
matter.
"
what
i
am
trying
to
point
out
is
that
wetlands
do
perform
this
flood
control
function,
and
that
when
you
remove
the
wetland
by
filling
it
in,
instead
of
a
wetland
you
need
a
corps
of
engineers
flood
control
project,
and
it
is
a
lot
more
extensive
than
cattails
acting
as
a
sponge
to
trap
overflow.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
the
commerce
clause.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
yes.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
that
is
correct,
for
an
adjacent
wetland.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
the
act
in
our
view
also
covers
wetlands
that
are
not
adjacent
to
navigable
waters,
that
are
called
isolated
wetlands.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
if
the
corps
of
engineers
affirmatively
demonstrates
that
the
use--
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
--or
destruction
of
that
wetland
would
have
an
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
that's
correct.
it
doesn't
matter
which
way.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
it
could
be
used...
it
could
be
interstate
travelers.
it
could
be
migratory
birds.
i
am
talking
about
isolated
wetlands
now,
and
again
this
is
not
a
case
of
an
isolated
wetland.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
if
they
were
migratory
birds,
yes.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
yes.
0
[generallaughter.]
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
it
can...
yes.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
missouri
versus
holland
would
be
an
example.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
it
is
a
treaty
power
case,
but
i
think
it
demonstrates
the
importance--
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
--north
dakota...
united
states
versus
north
dakota.
i
may
have
it
backwards.
i
think
it
is
north
dakota
versus
united
states,
which
dealt
with
prairie
potholes
in
north
dakota
as
important
breeding
grounds
for
migratory
waterfowl.
that
was
statutory
construction
case.
but
i
think
the
court
has
recognized
in
quite
a
few
cases
that--
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
--that
it
can
be.
if--
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
--duck
hunters.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
i
may
be
unable
to
give
you
a
case,
your
honor,
but
i
would
suggest
that
duck
hunters,
interstate
travelers
who
go
to
wildlife
refuges
to
view
ducks,
migratory
ducks
who
come
from
out
of
state,
all
of
that
together
combines
to
make
not
just
the
birds
alone
but
the
viewing
of
the
birds
and--
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
--it
has
an
effect
sufficient
to
constitute
a
connection
with
interstate
commerce.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
not
to
my
knowledge.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
if
you
have,
i
am
afraid
that
i
am
not--
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
--that
is
why,
your
honor,
i
was
trying
to
explain--
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
--what
it
is
that
an
adjacent
wetland,
not
an
isolated
wetland--
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
--this
case
isn't
an
isolated
wetland.
and
so
i
therefore
think
it
would
be
inappropriate
for
the
court
to
decide
in
this
case
what
congress
intended
with
respect
to
isolated
wetlands.
i
also--
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
--i
don't
think
you
have
that
case
before
you,
but
if
you
wish
to
put
it
before
you,
i
think
it
is
quite
clear
that
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
1977
amendments
to
the
clean
water
act,
that
congress
fully
understood,
and
there
is
one
portion
in
particular...
it
is
a
fairly
lengthy
section,
but
one
portion
of
the
congressional--
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
--yes,
your
honor.
it
is
reflected
section
404(g)
of
the
act,
which
was
an
addition
made
in
1977,
but
as
far
as
the
debate
is
concerned,
i
would
like
to...
when
the
court
is
studying
the
case,
i
think
the
most
helpful
part
is
the
senate
debate
on
the
1977
amendments,
and
it
is
quite
extensive,
at
123
congressional
record,
page
26,710
to
page
26,728.
those
pages
demonstrate
beyond:
question
that
congress
understood
fully
every
aspect
of
the
corps
of
engineers
wetland
regulatory
program,
including
its
regulation
of
isolated
wetlands,
its
regulation
of
adjacent
wetlands,
how
the
corps
was
phasing
in
expanded
jurisdiction,
and
congress
made
a
deliberate
choice.
congress
was
getting
vehement
complaints
from
farmers
and
from
foresters,
others
who
said
the
corps
has
gone
completely
overboard.
if
you
don't
stop
it,
cur
normal
activities
like
maintaining
drainage
ditches
will
be
subject
to
404
permits,
and
you
can't
ever
have
meant
that,
and
congress
came
up
with
two
alternatives.
one
was
to
exempt
the
farmers'
activities
from
regulation.
the
other
alternative
was
to
narrow
by
legislative
definition
the
geographic
scope
of
the
waters
and
wetlands
subject
to
corps
of
engineers
jurisdiction,
and
the
legislative
history
i
have
quoted
to
you
demonstrates
that
congress
deliberately
rejected
the
argument
riverside
is
urging
in
this
court,
and
instead
chose
to
opt
for
the
exemption
route,
and
what
it
did
in
the
new
amendments
to
section
404
was
exempt
normal
farming
and
forestry
activities
from
any
regulation.
but
it
affirmatively
left
unchanged
the
waters
and
wetlands
that
are
covered
by
the
act,
and
when
i
say
that
we
know
it
is
not
just
waters,
it
is
also
wetlands,
i
did
refer
you
to
section
404(g),
because
what
section
404(g)
does
is
establish
a
mechanism
whereby
states
who
qualify
can
take
over
the
section
404
permit
program
and
administer
it
in
lieu
of
the
corps
of
engineers
upon
showing
that
they
have
adequate
authority,
but
they
are
never
under
any
circumstances...
a
state
may
never
take
over
the
404
program
insofar
as
it
applies
to
traditional
navigable
waters
and
their
adjacent
wetlands,
and
that
is
spelled
out
exactly,
precisely
the
way
i
have
said
it
in
section
404(g).
so,
here,
going
back
to
this
wetland,
the
map
in
the
back
of
the
reply
brief,
we
have
a
wetland
that
michigan
would
never
be
allowed
to
regulate
because
it
falls
within
the
category
of
wetlands
that
congress
and
the
corps
of
engineers
both
deem
the
most
important
to
the
national
interest,
and
therefore
not
subject
or
suitable
for
delegation
to
local
control,
and
again,
i
come
back
to
the
point
that
our
concern
is
not
just
this
wetland
or
even
just
the
sixth
circuit.
our
concern
is,
if
the
sixth
circuit
is
upheld,
this
is
the
one
category
of
wetland
that
we
know
for
sure
congress
wanted
to
regulate.
we
know
that
by
the
language
of
section
404(g).
and
if
this
wetland
is
held
to
be
by
this
court,
or
if
the
sixth
circuit
is
affirmed,
outside
of
the
corps'
jurisdiction,
than
there
are
no
wetlands,
isolated
or
whatever
adjective
you
might
use,
that
are
covered
at
all.
that
is
clearly
contrary
to
legislative
intent.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
she
found--
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
--it
is
dead
wrong.
it
is
also
irrelevant,
though,
and
i
am
not
asking
the
court
to
find
that
she
was
clearly
erroneous,
although
i
am
convinced
that
she
was.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
yes,
in
two
different
senses.
in
this
case
there
is
a
hydrologic
connection
through
a
visible
surface
connection,
whereas
all
the
evidence
she
took
pertained
to
subsurface
ground
water
flow,
and
that
is
the
way
in
which
i
mean
that
her
finding
and
her
evidence
is
irrelevant,
because--
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
--she
had
the
same
maps,
but
she
made
no
findings.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
it
proves...
the
testimony
in
the
record
is
that
the
property
slopes
to
the
southeast.
therefore
water
from
the
wetland...
this
doesn't
require
you
to
find
facts.
it
is
already
a
fact
in
the
record
that
the
property
slopes
to
the
southeast.
water
from
the
wetland
has
to
drain
to
these
open
water
bodies.
and,
yes,
there
is
a
surface
connection.
if
there
were
a
concrete
wall
between--
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
--it's...
i
mean,
it's
true
that
the
soil
here
is
quite
wet,
but
at
some
point
the
ground
is
going
to
have
all
that
it
can
hold,
and
the
testimony
in
the
record
is,
this
has
been
a
wetland
for
decades,
possibly
for
over
100
years.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
on
which?
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
the
surface
connection?
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
no,
and
she
made
no
finding
one
way
or
the
other.
but
it's--
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
--because
what
she
described
as
the
only
evidence
she
was
talking
about
was
underground
holes
that
had
been
dug
on
the
property
to
see
how
quickly
water
came
in.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
that's
correct,
but
she
made
no
surface
findings
except
as
to
flooding,
and
that
was
this
direction.
she
made
no
surface
findings
as
to
drainage
in
this
direction.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
i
don't
think
you
have
to
make
a
finding.
i
think
that
the
one
or
two
factors
i
have
given
you,
all
of
which
are
in
the
record,
demonstrate
beyond
any
question--
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
--i
am
not
sure
if
i
am
permitted
to--
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
--that's
correct.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
the
direction
of
the
flow
is
to
the
southeast,
and
we
are
not
relying
on
the
adjacency
to
the
clinton
river,
partly
because
within
the
property
boundary,
the
part
that
is
closest
to
the
clinton
river
is
prior
filled
area,
and
therefore
probably
upland
area.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
and
so...
it
is
not
of
no
significance,
because
eventually
black
creek,
even
going
to
the
east,
if
you
then
go
north,
black
creek
comes
back
to
the
clinton
river.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
you
can
view
this
whole
area,
your
honor,
as
the
lateral
boundary
of
lake
st.
clair,
as
opposed
to
giving
these
individual
water
bodies
separate
names.
but
we
are
relying
primarily
on
the
adjacency
to
black
creek
which
in
turn
feeds
into
lake
st.
clair.
my
time
has
expired.
