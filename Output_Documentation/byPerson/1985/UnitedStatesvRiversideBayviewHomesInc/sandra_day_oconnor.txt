justice
sandra
day
o'connor
ms.
oberly,
may
i
inquire,
in
your
reply
brief
it
seemed
to
me
that
for
the
first
time
the
government
was
saying
that
the
land
in
this
case
is
connected
by
open
water
to
a
navigable
river
of
the
united
states.
so
is
the
position
you
are
now
taking
that
there
is
a
direct
surface
connection
between
the
land
at
issue
here
and
the
navigable
waters?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
why,
then,
didn't
the
corps
just
show
that
surface
connection
before
the
district
court
and
not
bother
with
subsurface
connections?
it
just
seemed
to
change
the
whole
theory
in
your
reply
brief.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
if
the
theory
that
you
now
assert
is
correct,
that
there
is
a
direct
surface
connection
to
navigable
water,
that
the
case
is
substantially--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
problem
is
if
the
facts
are
different
than
were
perceived
or
articulated
by
the
courts
below,
how
do
we
deal
with
that
to
get
to
the
legal
question?
and
we
have
to
send
it
back
somehow
first
so
that
the...
get
sorted
out.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
using
your
old
theory,
without
the
overlay
of
the
new
map
and
facts,
the
corps
includes
adjacent
wetlands
as
part
of
the
waters
of
the
united
states,
apparently
without
any
requirement
that
the
wetlands
or
the
discharges
to
them
affect
navigable
waters
or
interstate
commerce
in
any
way.
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
must
there
be--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--okay.
must
there
be
some
effect
on
navigable
waters
or
on
interstate
commerce?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
disregarding
this
case,
on
the
pure
theory,
must
there
be
a
connection?
must
it
affect
it,
or
not,
interstate
commerce?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
a
discharge
out.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
the
person
watering
his
back
yard
a
lot
is
not
going
to
be
brought
in
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
an
effect
by
some
connection
with
waters
in--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but
it
would
be
your
view
that
an
isolated
wetland
that
provided
refuge
for
birds
would
be
enough
for
corps
of
engineers
jurisdiction?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
there
is
no
indication
that
congress
would
have
been
concerned
about
pollution
flowing
from
adjacent
wetlands
into
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states,
and
want
to
regulate
them?
