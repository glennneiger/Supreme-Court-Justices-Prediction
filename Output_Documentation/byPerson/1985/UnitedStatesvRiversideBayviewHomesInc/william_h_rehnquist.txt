justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
regard
a
usgs
map
as
kind
of
an
open
sesame
to
the
correct
resolution
of
a
case.
i
dealt
with
a
number
of
them
in
my
practice.
they
can
be
as
wrong
as
anybody
else's.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
did
judge
kennedy
make
a
finding
that
this
map
was
accurate?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean,
is
your--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--so
the
position
you
are
taking
now,
you
feel,
is
completely
consistent
with
the
factual
findings
of
the
district
court
and
of
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
so
now
we
are
supposed
to
hear
you
and
kind
of
revise
the
court
of
appeals
description?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
you
are
bringing
here
then
is
essentially
a
factual
dispute
about
how
this
land
lies,
and
whether
there
is
a
surface
connection
or
not.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
the
court
of
appeals
is
wrong
in
having
described
a
property
a
particular
way.
is
that
the
case
we...
the
kind
of
case
we
have
to
hear?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
lawns
you
are
talking
about,
ms.
oberly,
then
are
situated
to
the
north
and
west
of
the
property
line?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
didn't
the
district
court
have
something
to
say
about
how
often
that
land
was
flooded?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
the
movement
of
birds
interstate
commerce?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
case
do
you
rely
on?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
was
a
treaty
power
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
demonstrates
the
treaty
power.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
the
migration
of
birds
is
interstate
commerce?
0
[generallaughter.]
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what...
in
what
cases--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--in
what
cases
have
we
recognized
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--did
she
make
any
finding
on
this?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
the
point
that
justice
stevens
asked
you
about.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
have
at
the
tip
of
your
fingers
or
tongue
a
citation
to
the
record
as
to
where
she
made
that
finding?
i
don't
mean
to
interrupt
your
argument
if
you
don't.
