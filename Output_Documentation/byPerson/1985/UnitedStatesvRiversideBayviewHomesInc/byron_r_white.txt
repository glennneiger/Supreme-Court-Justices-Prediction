justice
byron
r.
white
--what
did
the
district
court...
wasn't
there
some
expert
testimony
on
the
connection
between
this
wetland
and
the
navigable
waters?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
was
to
the
effect
that
there
was
no
connection.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
want
to
be
able
to
try
the
case
again.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what,
should
we
just
dismiss
it
as
improvidently
granted?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
didn't...
it
sounds
to
me
like
there
was
somewhat
of
some
omissions
at
the
trial
stage.
justice
byron
r.
white
at
the
appellate
stage.
i
would
think
you
would
be
satisfied
if
we
just
dismissed
as
improvidently
granted,
because
that
leaves
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
here--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
only
for
one
circuit.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
are
you
trying
to
win
the
case
on
another
ground?
why
don't
you
just--
justice
byron
r.
white
--why
did
you
ever...
why
did
you--
justice
byron
r.
white
--even
without
this
map
and
this
connection
with
the
water,
you
claim
the
court
of
appeals
is
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
would
suppose
you
would
rather
win
on
that
than
this.
justice
byron
r.
white
basically
what
is
the
constitutional
authority
for
this
statute
or
these
regulations?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
straight
the
commerce
clause.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
navigable
water
is
just
a
stand-in
for
an
effect
on
commerce.
if
you
are
adjacent
to...
or
if
you
connect
with
a
navigable
water,
you
are
in
interstate
commerce?
justice
byron
r.
white
uh-huh.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
then,
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
a
connection?
justice
byron
r.
white
one
way
or
the
other,
either...
running
either
way,
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there
was
an
aerial
connection,
as
you
say.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
there
is
an
argument
on
this
case
that
even
if...
whatever
power
congress
might
have
to
legislate
with
respect
to
isolated
potholes
or
wetlands,
they
didn't
in
this
case.
they
just
talked
about
effects
on
navigable
waters.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
an
isolated?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
we
should
be
careful...
we
should
be
careful
not
to
decide
that
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe
some
people
who
made
the
legislative
history
understood
that,
but
is
it
reflected
in
the
act?
that
is
the
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
the
original
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
the
regulation
then
just
exceeds
the
statutory
authority
where
it
says
that
a
wetland
is
any
area
that
is
inundated
or
saturated
by
surface
or
ground
water,
whether
it
has
got
any
connection
with
navigable
water
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
an
underground
connection.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
is
what
is
infirm
about
these
regulations,
you
say.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
defend
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you...
as
far
as
adjacency
is
concerned,
would
you
say
this
is
neighboring?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
there
was
a
connection--
justice
byron
r.
white
--then
you
would
think
the
statute
would
authorize
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
a
ground
water
connection.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
a
ground
water
connection.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
may
not.
it
may
not.
but
if
you
want
a
connection...
suppose
the
expert
had
testified
that
this
wetland
involved
here
was
made
wet
constantly
and
regularly
by
an
underground
seepage
from
the
river,
from
navigable
waters.
there
was
a
hydrological
connection
between
the
navigable
waters.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
it
a
fortiori
would
be
contrary
to
the
statute
in
your
view
to
attempt
to
regulate
that
kind
of
a
wetland.
