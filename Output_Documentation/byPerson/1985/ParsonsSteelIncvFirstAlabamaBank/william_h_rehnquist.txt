rehnquist
exactly
at
what
stage
was
the
state
court
proceeding
when
the
federal
court
entered
its
order?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
judgment
had
been
entered
then
or
the
verdict.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
may
solve
your
problem
under
the
anti-injunction
act,
but
it
doesn't
really
cover
the
res
judicata
point,
does
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
the
toucey
case,
which
it's
my
understanding
that
change
was
designed
to
overrule,
the
state
court
proceedings,
i
don't
believe
they
had
gone
to
judgment.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
toucey
is
on
all
fours
with
this
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
court
of
appeals
assumed
that
it
was
final,
didn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
on
page
a15
of
the
petition,
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
says
in
the
absence
of
federal
law
modifying
the
operation
of
section
1738,
the
full
faith
and
credit,
we
would
give
the
alabama
circuit
court's
res
judicata
ruling
the
same
effect
it
would
be
accorded
in
the
state
courts
of
that
state.
they
didn't
have
to
decide
what
it
was
because
they
say,
whatever
it
was,
we
are
not
going
to
accord
it
full
faith
and
credit.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
if
we
disagree
with
you
on
that
point,
as
justice
o'connor
has
hypothesized,
the
court
of
appeals
really
hasn't
decided
as
a
matter
of
alabama
law
whether
the
state
court
proceedings
have
gone
far
enough
to
be
res
judicata,
have
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
didn't
understand
him
to
concede
it...
i
thought
he
said
it
was
final
for
res
judicata
purposes,
that
the
alabama
courts
would
give
a
judgment
like
that
res
judicata.
you
argue
otherwise.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
don't
decide
questions
of
alabama
law
here.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
your
opponent
doesn't
say
that
it
would
not
be
res
judicata.
if
we
disagreed
with
your
toucey
reasoning,
i
suppose
the
eleventh
circuit
would
know
far
more
about
alabama
law
than
we
would.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
wasn't
the
hypothesis
that
the
eleventh
circuit--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
i
think
that
cuts
against
your
argument,
because
if
all
members
of
the
court
knew
it
had
gone
to
judgment,
and
neither
justice
frankfurter
nor
justice
reed
gave
that
any
significance
in
their
opinions,
it
would
seem
that
their
opinions
would
stand
without
it.
