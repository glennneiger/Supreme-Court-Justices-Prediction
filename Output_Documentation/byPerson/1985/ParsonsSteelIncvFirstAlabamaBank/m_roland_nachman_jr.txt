mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
in
1941,
this
court
in
toucey
against
new
york
life
decided
to
answer
negatively
the
question,
does
a
federal
court
have
the
power
to
enjoin
state
proceedings
which
seek
to
relitigate
a
claim
which
has
previously
been
adjudicated
by
a
federal
court
and
reduced
to
judgment
in
the
federal
court.
the
response
of
congress
was
precise
and
direct.
in
1948,
it
amended
what
was
then
section
265
of
the
judicial
code.
it
enacted
section
2283,
and
it
wrote
into
section
2283
the
precise
power
and
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
court
to
enjoin
the
relitigation
of...
in
these
circumstances,
and
it
empowered
the
federal
court
to
protect
and
effectuate
its
judgment
by
enjoining
state
proceedings.
we
have...
40
years...
excuse
me.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes,
sir,
we
submit
that
the
res
judicata
point
is
simply
a
red
herring
here.
congress
made
a
precise
judgment
in
1948
that
federal
courts
should
be
able
to
enjoin
state
proceedings.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
with
all
respect,
your
honor,
that
is
not
correct.
there
were
two
cases
that
were
involved
in
toucey,
and
one
of
them
was
the
iowa-wisconsin
bridge
case.
in
the
iowa-wisconsin
bridge
case,
which
was
part
of
toucey,
there
had
been
an
attempt
to
foreclose
a
mortgage
in
the
federal
court,
and
the
federal
court
had
declined
to
foreclose
the
mortgage
on
the
basis
that
there
was
invalidity
and
lack
of
consideration.
thereafter,
an
obligee,
phoenix
insurance
company,
brought
five
suits
on
the
underlying
notes
in
the
delaware
court,
and
the
delaware
court
had
decided
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
in
that
case.
it
had
been
reduced
to
judgment,
and
indeed
was
on
appeal
at
the
time
the
federal
injunction
issued.
so
those
were
the
precise
facts
that
confronted
this
court
in
toucey.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
toucey
is
on
all
fours
with
the
petitioner's
argument
in
this
case,
and
the
congressional
response
to
toucey,
the
enactment
of
the
relitigation
exception
in
section
2283
is
on
all
fours
with
this
case,
because
that
is
exactly
what
we
have
here.
and
we
have
mission
of
counsel
as
he
must,
and
there
is
a
side
by
side
comparison
of
the
two
complaints,
which
is
attached
as
an
appendix
to
our
brief,
and
it
is
also
in
the
record.
the
two
complaints
are
virtually--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
--yes,
indeed,
justice
o'connor,
because
the
very
thing
that
congress
did
in
1948
was
to
adopt
the
dissenting
opinion
of
justice
reed
and
the
other
dissenters
to
the
effect
that
a
plea
of
res
judicata
and
subsequent
review
of
that
plea
in
the
state
court
was
not
an
adequate
remedy
to
protect
the
federal
judgment,
and
we
don't
have
to
speculate
about
what
the
congressional
history
was.
we
don't
have
to
apply
general
tenets
of
statutory
construction
and
this
sort
of
thing.
this
was
a
precise,
discrete
judgment
that
congress
made
with
regard
to
relitigation,
and
otherwise,
it
would
make
no
sense
whatever,
not
only
in
terms
of
the
legislative
history,
but
in
terms
of
tactics.
no
prudent
counsel
could
afford
not
to
file
a
plea
of
res
judicata
in
the
state
proceeding
and
gamble
everything
on
getting
a
federal
injunction,
and
yet
as
the
court
of
appeals
below
pointed
out,
petitioner's
argument,
and
the
full
faith
and
credit
argument
would
mean
that
as
soon...
that
unless
the
federal
court
issued
an
injunction
before
a
state
court
did
anything,
that
the
state
court
would
take
over,
precisely
what
congress
wanted
to
prevent.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
interestingly
enough,
your
honor,
and
we
don't
understand
it--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
--but
the
petitioners
don't
even
present
that
question
for
review.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
their
brief
says
that
they
don't.
reading
from
their
brief.
page
28,
note
20.
"the
question
of
whether
the
courts
below
were
correct
in
ultimately
finding
that
the
state
action
was
barred
by
the
federal
judgment
under
principles
of
res
judicata
and
collateral
estoppel
is
not
presented
to
this
court.
"
i
don't
know
what
he
means.
we
are
here.
this
is
the
ultimate
federal
question.
there
is
no--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
--well,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
district
court
was
correct.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
and
that
question
is
not
now
presented
for
review,
so
i
assume
that
this
court
approaches
this
matter
on
the
assumption
that
the
petitioner
is
not
presenting--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
--as
i
understand
the
rules
of
this
court,
your
honor--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
--i
say
this
certainly
with
apology.
if
a
question
is
not
presented
for
review,
the
court
ordinarily
doesn't
decide
it.
i
realize
there
are
exceptions
to
that.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
so
we
start
with
that
premise.
we
think
that
the
decision
is
absolutely
correct,
and
we
have
pointed
out
numerous
cases
in
our
brief,
and
there
are
even
more
cited
in
the
court
of
appeals
decision
which
support
it.
we
think
it
is
a
classic
situation
of
a
party
bringing
one
action
in
the
federal
court
and
one
action
in
the
state
court.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
they
could
have
been.
they
weren't.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
in
fact--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
--it
doesn't
have
to,
but
that,
as
the
cases
point
out,
is
no
reason
for
not
bringing
it
in
order
to
avoid
the
bar
of
res
judicata
and
collateral
estoppel.
the
harper
plastics
case,
for
example,
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
makes
that
plain.
and
the
cases
that...
and
we
have
cited
them
in
our
brief...
that
have
been
brought
under
the
bank
holding
company
act,
without
really
any
differentiation
have
always
alleged
state
business
torts
and
state
interference
and
antitrust
claims
along
with
bank
holding
company
claims.
but
what
we
have
here
is
almost
identical
transactions
alleged
in
both
courts,
and
in
the
federal
court--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
--no,
ma'am.
we
disagree.
if
the
court
will
look
as
paragraphs
of
the
state
complaint
and
the
federal
complaint,
both
seek
to
the
penny
the
damage
done
by
wrongful
deprivation
of
the
assets
of
the
subsidiary
through
foreclosure,
2.4
million
plus
dollars.
we
disagree
entirely
when
counsel
says
that
the
interests
of
the
subsidiary
were
not
involved.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
we
would
disagree
with
that
conclusion.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
but
beyond
that
we
would
say
that
in
this
case,
as
your
honor
brought
out
in
questioning
from
petitioner's
counsel,
the
state
res
judicata
judgment
is
not
final
under
state
law
by
virtue
of
the
then
pending
posttrial
motions
for
judgment
nov
and
new
trial.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
i
don't
think
the
court
of
appeals
went
into
that
question,
your
honor,
because
that
suggestion
that
came
from...
in
the
petitioner's
brief
that
the
federal
injunction
would
have
been
permissible
before
finality
was
not
made
there.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
well,
yes,
sir,
i
agree,
and
we
certainly
don't
restrict
our
position
to
an
argument
that
this
was
a
nonfinal
state
judgment
that
was
not
entitled
to
full
faith
and
credit.
we
state
and
have
urged
repeatedly
here
and
below
that
what
congress
did
in
the
relitigation
exception
to
2238
was
a
discrete
empowering
of
the
federal
court
to
issue
an
injunction
to
protect
and
effectuate
its
judgment.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
that
precise
question
was
not
decided,
but
counsel
has
conceded
that
it
is
not
final.
we
have
cited
authority--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
--i
don't
think
there
is
any
question,
your
honor,
that
this
is--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
--i
understand,
sir.
but
i
think
there
is
no
question
that
there
is...
that
the
alabama
judgment,
that
it
would
not
recognize
the
preclusive
effect
of
the
earlier
federal
judgment
was
entered...
is
not
final
because
it
was
pending
on
posttrial
motions
at
the
time
the
injunction
issued.
there
is
really
no
question
about
that.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
i
will
accept
that
premise,
of
course.
all
i
am
saying,
your
honor,
is
that
i
don't
think
there
is
any
dispute
between
counsel
here
that
this
state
res
judicata
judgment
was
nonfinal.
it
was
pending
on
a
motion
for
new
trial,
a
motion
for
judgment
nov
and
under
alabama
procedure
it
is
nonfinal.
it
won't
support
an
appeal.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
no,
sir,
it
was
not.
it
was
not,
and
we
don't
take
that
hypothesis
here.
we
think
that
the
finality
or
lack
of
finality
of
the
state
judgment
is
irrelevant.
congress
has
empowered
the
federal
courts
to
issue
an
injunction
to
protect
and
effectuate
their
earlier
judgments
when
there
is
an
attempt
to
relitigate.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
no,
sir.
we
do
not
agree,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
think
that
the
interests
of
federalism
and
comity
and
those
principles,
those
underlying
policies
were
indeed
addressed
by
congress
when
it
enacted
the
relitigation
exception
in
1948.
congress
opted
for
a
choice
of
a
policy
position
that
it
was
an
inadequate
remedy
to
protect
a
federal
judgment
and
to
preserve
the
fruits
to
the
victor
in
the
federal
judgment,
that
this
federal
judgment
form
nothing
more
than
the
basis
of
a
plea
of
res
judicata
in
a
state
court
which
could
or
could
not
be
reviewed
ultimately
here
under
considerations
which
would
show
that
they
involved
matters
of
public
interest
as
well
as
the
private
interest
of
the
litigants,
and
where
matters
of
public
interest
in
those
circumstances
prevailed.
now,
as
far
as
the
extent
to
which
the
proceedings
had
gone
in
the
state
court,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
these
matters
happened
on
the
eve
of
the
state
trial,
and
we
were
faced
with
a
new
state
judge,
a
denial
of
motion
for
summary
of
judgment
a
couple
of
weeks,
three
weeks
before
trial.
on
three
days
before
trial
we
urged,
and
this
is
all
in
the
record,
we
urged
the
state
trial
court
to
postpone
the
trial,
to
give
us
a
continuance,
and
to
present
an
interlocutory
review
of
the
res
judicata
question
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
under
a
procedure
which
is
similar
to
28
usca
1292(b),
the
interlocutory
appeal
federal
statute.
alabama
has
a
similar...
that
was
denied.
so,
this
was
on
a
friday,
and
the
trial
began
on
monday.
we
urged
indeed
that
our
counterclaim
in
the
state
court
be
considered
as
having
been
barred
by
the
early
federal
judgment
just
as
the
plaintiff's
claim
was
barred,
and
that
summary
judgments
be
issued
on
those
bases,
so
that
that
matter
could
be
resolved.
we
were
not
the
ones
pressing
for
a
trial,
which
ultimately
ensued.
we
had
to
pursue
the
trial.
we
had
to
present
all
of
our
defenses
in
the
trial.
we
couldn't
simply
singleshot
the
preclusion
matter
and
ignore
the
others.
so,
that
is
the
background,
and
at
the
earliest
opportunity,
when
it
was
apparent
that
the
state
court
was
not
going
to
grant
appropriate
and
proper
preclusive
effect
to
the
earlier
federal
judgment,
that
we
sought
the
injunction
and
obtained
it
in
the
federal
court.
but
as
the
court
below
points
out,
the
relitigation
statute
doesn't
apply
at
particular
points
in
time,
and
indeed
it
couldn't,
because
let
us
suppose
that
the
state
court,
trial
court
agreed
with
us
and
the
federal
court
about
the
preclusive
effect
of
the
earlier
federal
judgment.
that
could
be
reversed
on
appeal
by
the
state
appellate
court,
and
then
we
would
be
back
in
the
same
situation
where
the
injunction
was
necessary.
we
think,
moreover,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
an
attempt
to
get
the
alabama
court
to
grant
proper
preclusive
effect
was
if
not
required,
certainly
indicated
by
the
judicial
gloss
which
the
federal
courts
have
placed
on
2283
since
1948,
where
they
indicate
in
essence
that
the
fact
that
congress
has
accorded
this
authority
and
this
jurisdiction
on
the
federal
court
doesn't
mean
that
it
comes
into
play
automatically.
and
for
that
reason
as
well,
it
was
felt
that
it
was
necessary
to
give
the
state
courts
an
opportunity
to
decide
this
question,
and
indeed,
as
i
have
mentioned
a
few
moments
ago,
matters
of
practicality
and
prudence
also
dictated
that,
because
if
we
did
not
present
the
res
judicata
and
collateral
estoppel
defense
to
the
state
court,
but
simply
sought
an
injunction
in
the
federal
court,
and
if
we
got
it
in
the
federal
court
and
it
was
reversed
on
appeal,
or
if
we
didn't
get
it
in
the
federal
court,
in
the
federal
district
court,
then
we
really
would
have
waived
the
opportunity
to
assert
that
defense
in
the
state
court.
so,
there
are
all
kinds
of
reasons
why
it
has
to
be,
the
defense
has
to
be
asserted
in
the
state
proceeding,
but
none
of
this
undermines
or
can
undermine
the
authority
that
congress
conferred
on
federal
district
courts
to
issue
injunction
against
state
proceedings
to
protect
and
effectuate
their
judgment.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
excuse
me.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
because
we
would
not
have
been
able
to...
we
could
have
gone,
but
we
would
have
been
faced
with
a
line
of
decisions
which
as
we
read
them
say
you
don't
get
this
injunction
automatically.
you
have
got
to
show
that
the
federal
judgment
is
in
danger.
you
have
got
to
show
that
there
is
a
substantial
basis
for
asserting
the
federal
court
that
the
state
courts
are
not
going
to
give
proper
preclusive
effect--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
--on
the
basis
of
a
general--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
--it
may
have
been,
your
honor,
but
the
recitation
in
the
order
denying
summary
judgment
was
that
there
was...
i
am
reading
from
page
220
of
the
record.
"the
court
is
of
the
opinion
that
there
are
genuine
issues
as
to
material
fact
existing
in
this
cause,
and
that
the
motions
for
summary
judgment
are
each
due
to
be
denied.
"
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
that
was
an
early
order
by
a
different
judge
who
had
recused
himself.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
well,
at
that
time,
your
honor,
the
one
on
219
was...
that
order
came
down
on
march
17th
of
'82,
i
believe,
which
was
before
the
court
of
appeals
had
affirmed
the
original
federal
judgment,
and
that
was
one
of
the...
this
isn't
in
the
record,
but
that
was
one
of
the
arguments
that
was
made
to
the
court,
that
the
federal
judgment
at
that
time
was
on
appeal.
the
affirmance
of
the
federal
judgment
didn't
come
down
until
june
of
1982,
and
this
first
denial
that
your
honor
is
referring
to
is
in
march
of
1982.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
he
doesn't
in
so
many
words,
your
honor,
but
as
i
pointed
out
in
answer
to
justice
rehnquist,
those
were
the
underlying
facts
that
confronted
this
court
when
it
decided
toucey,
namely,
a
decision
by
the
delaware
courts
that
despite
the
refusal
of
the
federal
district
court
to
foreclose
the
mortgage,
that
the
noteholders
could
sue
in
the
state
court
and
prevail
on
the
notes
which
the
mortgage
was
given
to
secure.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
but
it
does
cite,
your
honor,
in
the
opinion...
i
think
it
is
14
atlantic
2nd
or
something
like
that,
the
delaware
decision
is
cited
in
justice
frankfurter's
decision.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
that
may
be,
your
honor,
but
what
we
are
talking
about
is
not
what
may
or
may
not
have
been
in
the
minds...
in
those
opinions.
but
what
congress
wanted
to
do
after
it
faced
the
toucey
opinion,
and
it
wanted
to
make
clear
that
federal
courts
had
this
power...
now,
we
submit
in
answer
to
justice
stevens'
questions
as
well
that
if
the
petitioner's
res
judicata
argument
is
adopted,
then
2283,
the
relitigation
exception,
is
totally
emasculated.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
the
federal
court...
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes,
sir,
because
even
if
a
state
trial
court
gives
appropriate
preclusive
effect
to
a
prior
federal
judgment,
that
is
always
subject
to
reversal
by
the
state
appellate
court,
so
in
order
to
give
the
scope
to
2283
that
congress
intended
per
force
it
must
apply
to
a
decision
of
the
state
appellate
court
and
permit
an
injunction
of
the
state
appellate
proceedings
as
well
as
state
trial
proceedings.
indeed,
two
of
the
cases
we
cite
in
our
brief,
the
silcox
case
and
the
brown
against
mccormick
cases,
in
both
of
those
cases,
the
matters
had
gotten
to
the
appellate
courts
before
the
federal
injunction
issued,
and
in
one
of
the
cases
the
federal
appellate
court
commended
the
parties
for
going
that
far
in
seeking
to
get
the
state
to
give
the
proper
preclusive
effect
to
the
earlier
federal
judgment
before
seeking
relief
in
the
federal
courts.
in
answer
to
justice
white's
question
about
the
acl
case,
that
case
as
we
understand
it,
and
we
have
discussed
it
at
some
length
in
our
brief,
as
we
understand
it,
went
on
the
point
that
because
of
the
norris-laguardia
act,
the
federal
district
court
had
not
decided
earlier
the
question
of
whether
there
could
be
a
federal
injunction
against...
a
state
injunction
against...
excuse
me,
a
federal
injunction
against
picketing,
and
that
simply
there
was
a
withholding
of
jurisdiction
according
to
the
majority
analysis,
your
honor,
and
i
believe
justice
brennan
dissented,
feeling
that
there
had
been
a
broader
issue
than
just
the
withdrawal
of
jurisdiction
under
the
norris-laguardia
act.
but
the
point
of
the
decision
was
that
the
federal
district
court
had
not
decided
the
matter
that
was
later
decided
by
the
state
court
which
issued
the
injunction,
and
therefore
the
relitigation
exception
did
not
come
into
play.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
there
was
picketing
at
a
railroad
terminal
in
jacksonville.
the
railroad
went
to
the
federal
court
to
seek
an
injunction,
and
it
was
denied
an
injunction.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
the
majority
felt
because
of
the
withdrawal
of
jurisdiction
or
injunction
in
labor
disputes
by
the
norris-laguardia
act--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
--that
was
your
honor's
view,
and
that
was
mr.
justice
brennan's
view.
but
the
majority,
as
we
understand
it,
said
that
was
the
basis,
and
then
that
therefore
the
matter
of
whether
or
not
to
issue
an
injunction
had
never
been
litigated
because
the
court
felt
that
there
was
no
authority
to
issue
the
injunction
since
it
had
been
withdrawn,
the
jurisdiction
had
been
withdrawn
by
the
norris-laguardia
act.
so,
relitigation
was
said
not
to
have
been
present
in
that
case.
had
it
been
present,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
assume
because
justice
black
said
it
was--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
--because
the
issues
of
whether
or
not
those
same
facts
provided
a
remedy
under
state
tort
law
of
fraud
and
commercial
unreasonableness
of
sale
and
conversion
should
have
been
raised
in
the
federal
action.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
and
indeed
there
is
ample
discussion
in
our
brief--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
and
bear
in
mind,
your
honor,
the
plaintiff
went
to
both
courts.
the
plaintiff
is
the
party
of
the
petitioner
here
who
sought
to
split
this
cause
of
action
and
seek
one
remedy
in
the
federal
court
and
another
in
the
state
court.
and
with
the
brief
time
remaining,
i
would
take
issue
with
counsel,
as
we
do
at
considerable
length
in
our
brief,
that
the
interests
of
the
trustee,
the
trustee
representing
the
subsidiary,
was
clearly
in
privity
with
the
parsons
interest.
the
subsidiary
was
wholly
owned
by
a
plaintiff
corporation,
and
the
plaintiff
corporation
was
99
percent
owned
by
the
other
two
natural
parties
in
the
federal
litigation.
their
interests
were
identical,
not
just
in
privity.
they
did
seek,
as
i
pointed
out
in
answer
to
a
question
from
justice
o'connor,
a
stripping
of
assets
of
$2.4
million.
we
have
pointed
out
various
arguments
and
evidence
introduced,
charges
to
the
jury,
and
all
that
show
that
the
interests
of
the
subsidiary
were
involved
in
the
federal
litigation.
the
lawyer
for
the
trustee
participated
in
15
depositions
which
were
taken
jointly
and
concurrently
in
the
cases,
and
knowingly
elected
to
stay
out
of
the
federal
litigation.
if
ever
there
was
a
case
of
privity
and
bar
as
a
result
of
privity,
this
is
it.
we
urge
that
the
case
be
affirmed.
