--mr.
nachman,
in
terms
of
federalism
and
comity...
well,
let
me
start
over.
given
that
a
state
court
judgment
of
the
court
of
first
instance
is
on
appeal,
and
therefore
not
final
within
the
framework
of
the
state
system,
in
terms
of
federalism
and
comity,
hasn't
the
proceeding
gone
to
such
lengths
that
full
faith
and
credit
ought
to
come
into
play?

justice
warren
