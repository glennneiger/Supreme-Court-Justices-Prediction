mr.
frank
m.
wilson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
decisions
of
the
courts
below
in
this
case
destroy
the
balance
between
the
coexisting
equal
independent
court
systems
that
form
the
basis
of
our
federal
system.
petitioners
here
seek
the
reversal
of
an
injunction
of
an
ongoing
state
court
proceeding.
the
federal
district
court's
basis
for
that
injunction
was
its
determination
that
an
earlier
federal
case
barred
the
state
action
under
principles
of
collateral
estoppel
and
res
judicata.
that
issue
had
already
been
litigated
fully
and
fairly
in
the
state
court
at
the
time
of
the
injunction.
in
addition,
the
injunction
is
directed
toward
the
litigation,
who
was
never
a
party
to
that
earlier
federal
judgment,
and
whose
only
opportunity
to
litigate
his
issues
came
in
the
state
court
decision.
the
case
arises
out
of
these
circumstances.
in
february
of
1979,
a
montgomery
steel
company,
parsons
steel
industries,
its
parent
corporation,
and
the
stockholders
of
that
corporation
filed
a
lawsuit
against
the
bank,
a
loan
officer,
and
a
number
of
other
individuals
in
montgomery
county
state
court.
this
is
what
we
have
come
to
call
the
state
action
in
this
case.
the
issues
there
raised
a
number
of
claims
under
state
law,
purely
under
state
law,
fraud,
conversion,
breach
of
fiduciary
duty,
and
a
number
of
other
claims.
approximately
six
weeks
later,
that
steel
company
was
adjudicated
a
bankrupt
on
the
petition
of
several
of
its
creditors,
an
involuntary
bankrupt.
at
that
time
its
parent
corporation
and
the
shareholders
of
that
corporation
lost
all
authority
to
act
for
the
subsidiary
which
was
in
bankruptcy.
some
six
weeks
later,
the
parent
corporation
and
its
shareholders
filed
a
second
action
in
federal
district
court.
although
on
very
similar
factual
allegations...
the
complaints
are
similar...
the
legal
claim
made
there
was
a
violation
of
a
narrowly
drawn
federal
statute,
the
bank
holding
company
act.
it
is
undisputed
in
this
case
that
no
damages
were
sought
on
behalf
of
the
trustee
or
the
bankrupt
corporation
in
that
proceeding.
the
cases
proceeded
parallel
through
the
two
court
systems.
mr.
frank
m.
wilson
damages
on
behalf
of
the
parent
corporation
only
and
its
stockholders,
nothing
on
behalf
of
the
trustee.
mr.
frank
m.
wilson
at
the
time
the
complaints
were
filed,
they
were,
very
similar
facts.
there
were
amendments
to
both
complaints
during
the
course
of
these
proceedings
where
additional
allegations
were
made
in
both
actions
and
they
changed
some,
but
at
the
time
of
the
filing,
there
is
no
question
that
they
were
very
similar,
and
there
is
no
dispute
about
that
aspect
of
it.
the
federal
court
bifurcated
the
case.
they
issued
a
liability
from
damages.
there
was
a
jury
verdict.
the
jury
resolved
the
federal
action
issues
in
favor
of
the
plaintiffs
there.
the
trial
judge
granted
judgment
nov,
judgment
outstanding
the
verdict.
he
held
that
there
had
been
no
proof
which
would
sustain
a
jury
verdict
on
any
of
the
elements
of
that
cause
of
action.
that
was
hotly
disputed,
as
you
might
imagine,
by
the
appellant.
on
the
appeal,
the
eleventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed
on
a
different
basis,
and
they
held
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
allegations
made
in
the
federal
action
did
not
constitute
a
violation
of
that
statute.
after
they
received
their
nov
judgment,
the
bank
asserted
that
judgment
as
collateral
estoppel
and
res
judicata
in
the
state
action.
that
issue
was
litigated,
pretrial,
a
jury
verdict
ensued
after
a
trial
on
the
merits,
and
that
particular
issue,
the
res
judicata
effect
of
the
federal
judgment,
was
fully
and
fairly
litigated
in
the
state
court.
only
then,
after
a
judgment
for
the--
mr.
frank
m.
wilson
--yes,
sir,
state
law
grounds--
mr.
frank
m.
wilson
--yes,
sir,
on
state
law
grounds,
but
the
federal
issue,
that
is,
the
preclusive
effect
of
the
first
federal
judgment,
was
fully
litigated
there
in
the
state
court
as
an
affirmative
defense
by
the
bank.
mr.
frank
m.
wilson
absolutely,
without
question.
only
then,
after
that
issue
had
been
fairly
litigated
in
state
court,
did
the
bank
request
the
injunctive
relief
which
was
ultimately
granted
by
the
federal
district
court.
that
court--
mr.
frank
m.
wilson
--at
the
time
the
respondent
sought
the
injunction
in
federal
court,
its
post-trial
motions
were
pending
in
state
court.
they
have
not
been
decided
because
once
the
injunction
issued,
no
further
proceedings
took
place
in
state
court.
there
has
been
no
decision
on
the
postjudgment
motions
and
no
appeal
in
the
state
court.
we
are
talking
about
trial
level
only
in
the
state
court.
mr.
frank
m.
wilson
they
take
that
position,
and
as
a
matter--
mr.
frank
m.
wilson
--it
is
factually
correct.
i
do
not
believe
it
has
any
validity
to
the
policy
considerations
this
court
could
make,
because
you
could
say
the
same
thing
about
a
petition
for
rehearing
to
the
alabama
supreme
court.
technically
the
judgment
would
not
be
final
at
that
stage.
however,
there
is
no--
mr.
frank
m.
wilson
--i
agree
absolutely.
mr.
frank
m.
wilson
yes.
mr.
frank
m.
wilson
the
bank
had
filed
its
postjudgment
motions
for
new
trial
and
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdicts.
mr.
frank
m.
wilson
yes,
sir.
judgment
had
been
entered,
and
that
is...
the
final
judgment
is
page
251
of
the
joint
appendix,
which
was
entered
on
february
the
9th
of
1983,
and
within
the
30-day
period
they
filed
their
postjudgment
motions.
the
federal
district
court
refused
to
give
full
faith
and
credit
to
the
state
court
determination
of
the
res
judicata/collateral
estoppel
issue.
the
court
of
appeals
in
review
of
that
particular
issue
as
we
raised
it
there
held
that
the
anti-injunction
statute
and
the
so-called
relitigation
exception
to
that
statute
is
an
exception
to
the
full
faith
and
credit
act.
we
believe
that
was
erroneous
as
a
matter
of
law,
and
that
is
one
of
our
principal
bases
of
seeking
a
reversal
of
the
injunction.
the
full
faith
and
credit
act,
as
this
court
has
recognized
on
a
number
of
occasions,
in
essence
establishes
our
separate
but
equal
court
system,
requiring
both
sides
to
give
full
faith
and
credit
to
the
other
decisions.
this
court
has
held--
mr.
frank
m.
wilson
--a
nonfinal
judgment
is
not
given
preclusive
effect
under
the
full
faith
and
credit
act.
mr.
frank
m.
wilson
justice
rehnquist,
i
would
confess
that
i
have
difficulty
with
that
issue.
it
appears
to
me
that
it
is
a
final
judgment
when
they
determine
it
on
the
merits,
but
technically,
for
purposes
of
an
appeal
in
the
alabama
court
system,
it
is
not
final
because
they
have
filed
their
postjudgment
motions,
but
i
don't
think
that
that
should...
i
don't
see
that
as
a
basis
for
this
court
allowing
an
injunction
after
such
substantial
resources
have
been
expended.
mr.
frank
m.
wilson
certainly.
certainly
they
would
have
under
state
law,
and
subject
to
its
appeal,
and
of
course
if
you
are
ultimately
successful
in
having
that
judgment
reversed
on
appeal,
then
its
res
judicata
effect
is
eliminated,
but
for
res
judicata
purposes
certainly
it
would
be
a
final
judgment.
mr.
frank
m.
wilson
i
am
saying
it
was
the
trial
court's
entering
a
final
judgment
on
the
jury
verdict,
the--
mr.
frank
m.
wilson
--and
on
the
federal
law
affirmative
defense
asserted
by
the
bank
there
of
collateral
estoppel,
the
preclusive
effect
of
that
earlier
federal
judgment.
the
affirmative
defense
was
presented
by
summary
judgment--
mr.
frank
m.
wilson
--i
would
still
be
arguing
that
this
is
too
great
of
an
intrusion
into
state
court
system.
yes,
i
would,
but
i
don't
think
i
would
have
the
full
faith
and
credit
act
to
support
my
argument
as
i
do
now,
because
they
have
considered
and
determined
that
issue
and
given
the--
mr.
frank
m.
wilson
--certainly.
mr.
frank
m.
wilson
certainly.
mr.
frank
m.
wilson
absolutely,
and
that
is
the
nature
of
the
independent...
the
independent
nature
of
the
two
court
systems.
this
court
ultimately
can
decide
that
issue.
it
is
a
federal
issue
presented
in
the
state
court
and
which
formed
the
basis
for
a
petition
for
certiorari
later.
mr.
frank
m.
wilson
as
far
as
the
bar
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
act,
yes,
they
could
have.
mr.
frank
m.
wilson
i
would
still--
mr.
frank
m.
wilson
--on
the
merits,
and
that
is
the
point
that
is
made
by
judge
hill
in
his
dissent
in
the
eleventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
opinion,
and
i
think
it
is
a
good
one,
that
you
can
resolve
the
two
acts.
what
this
court
has
taught,
when
you
look
for
an
implied
repeal
or
an
exception
to
the
full
faith
and
credit
act,
you
look
for
some
clear
intention,
some
idea
that
the
statutes
cannot
operate
together
without
some
deadlock,
some
direct
conflict,
and
i
would
suggest
that
that
conflict
is
eliminated
if
you
construe
the
statutes
together
as
judge
hill
did,
that
is,
until
that
state
court
rules
on
the
merits,
you
can
have
an
injunction,
assuming
you
have
the
other
requirement
for
an
injunction.
mr.
frank
m.
wilson
correct,
as
far
as
the
full
faith
and
credit
act.
mr.
frank
m.
wilson
i
do,
and
i
think
that
the
reason
is
that
the
independent
nature
of
the
court
systems
are
destroyed
if
you
allow
the
federal
district
court
to
sit
in
effect
in
appellate
review
of
that
issue
when
it
has
been
determined
on
the
merits
by
the
state
court.
prior
to
that
time...
there
are
going
to
be
problems
any
time
you
have
an
injunction
of
a
state
court
proceeding,
and
the
policies,
of
course,
as
this
court
has
enunciated,
weigh
against
it
under
any
set
of
circumstances.
mr.
frank
m.
wilson
i
am
sorry,
justice
white,
but
i
did
not
follow
your
question.
if
this
court
ruled,
the
state
court
obviously
could
not
ignore
this
court's
ruling
regardless
of
when
and
where
it
was
made.
mr.
frank
m.
wilson
let
me
ask
you
this.
in
your
hypothetical,
is
there
an
injunction
by
the
trial
level
court?
mr.
frank
m.
wilson
in
doing
that--
mr.
frank
m.
wilson
--in
that
instance,
there
would
have
been
no
conflict
between
action
by
the
state
court
and
action
by
the
federal
district
court.
it
would
not
have
reviewed
anything
that
occurred
in
the
state
court
because
of
res
judicata--
mr.
frank
m.
wilson
--certainly
if
this
court...
if
this
court
has
ruled
on
the
issue
of
the
preclusive
effect
of
that
federal
judgment,
then
any
court
on
either
side
of
the
dual
system
must
of
course
respect
this
court's
decision
on
that
issue.
mr.
frank
m.
wilson
i
do
say
that.
i
certainly
do
say
that.
mr.
frank
m.
wilson
i
say
you
should
not
reach
that
in
this
case,
because
that
issue,
you
should
allow
the
state
courts
the
opportunity
to
resolve
all
issues
before
them
before
a
federal
court
intervenes
to
correct
any
wrongdoing
this
court
might
ultimately
find.
mr.
frank
m.
wilson
yes,
sir,
that
is
exactly
my
position,
and
there
is
a
reason.
the
basic
nature
of
the
federal
system
requires
that,
although
admittedly
it
creates
problems
any
time
you
have
a
federal
and
a
state
court
with
similar
issues
before
them
at
the
same
time.
mr.
frank
m.
wilson
if
it
were
permissible,
and
if
it
met
all
the
other
requirements,
yes.
under
the
full
faith
and
credit
act,
it
is
permissible.
mr.
frank
m.
wilson
that's
correct,
but
that
raises
the
same
question
as
raised
by
justice
rehnquist's
earlier
question.
at
that
point,
there
would
be
no
final
judgment
for
state
law
res
judicata
purposes.
the
denial
of
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
is
not
a
final
judgment
for
purposes
of
application,
and
you
could
comply
with
the
full
faith
and
credit
act
because
the
full
faith
and
credit
act
requires
that
the
federal
district
court
give
the
same
preclusive
effect
to
the
state
court
adjudication
as
would
be
given
in
that
state.
and
at
that
point
it
has
no
preclusive
effect,
because
a
denial
of
a
summary
judgment
motion
is
not
a
final
judgment
in
alabama
courts
for
preclusive
purposes.
there
has
been...
the
suggestion
in
the
court
of
appeals
was
and
by
the
respondent
here
that
somehow
or
another
the
1948
amendment
to
the
anti-injunction
statute
gave
the
federal
district
court
an
exception
to
ignore
the
full
faith
and
credit
act.
i
would
like
to
address
that
very
briefly
and
only
say
that
it
is
clear
that
that
amendment
has
unanimously
been
recognized
by
everyone
concerned
as
restoring
the
law
as
understood
prior
to
this
court's
decision
in
toucey.
that
issue
had
never
been
presented
in
any
case
prior,
was
not
presented
there,
and
certainly
the
overruling
of
toucey
does
not
require
that
an
additional
power
be
given
to
the
state
court,
that
is,
to
reconsider
an
issue
fully
and
finally
adjudicated
by
the
state
court.
on
the
full
faith
and
credit
issue
let
me
make
one
further
point.
the
court
of
appeals
raised
a
problem,
that
is,
the
requirement
that
the
litigant
must
rush
back
to
federal
court
to
obtain
an
injunction
any
time
there
might
be
a
decision
on
the
merits.
that
is
a
problem
that
is
going
to
be
raised.
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
that
it
is
preferable
to
allowing
a
litigant
such
as
the
bank
in
this
case
to
make
a
strategic
decision
to
present
its
res
judicata
defense
and
other
affirmative
defenses
to
the
state
court
and
have
a
judgment
on
the
merits.
in
essence,
the
interpretation
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
made
allows
the
bank
two
bites
at
the
apple,
two
adjudications
of
their
res
judicata
issue,
and
that
is
something
which
even
the
policy
of
res
judicata
would
not
allow.
if
you
look
to
the--
mr.
frank
m.
wilson
--it
is
my
understanding
that
the
question
was
the
res
judicata
effect
for
purposes
of
preclusion...
excuse
me,
for
purposes
of
a
final
judgment
for
collection
purposes
and
enforcement
purposes.
i
cannot
distinguish
the
case
any
further
than
that
except
to
say
that
i
don't
have
the
same
understanding
that
apparently
the
court
does.
mr.
frank
m.
wilson
no,
i
do
not,
justice
o'connor.
assuming
that
the
full
faith
and
credit
act
is
not
a
bar
to
the
injunction
in
the
case,
and
that
the
court
reaches
the
injunction
on
its
merits,
i
think
it
is
important
to
distinguish
the
position
of
the
different
litigants
as
to
that
injunction.
the
trustee
stands
in
a
different
position
from
the
other
litigants.
he
was
never
a
party
to
the
earlier
federal
judgment.
he
was
not
represented
in
that
federal
judgment
by
anyone
who
had
authority
to
represent
him.
at
the
time
that
judgment
was
filed,
there
had
been
a
trustee
appointed
for
that
bankrupt
corporation,
and
the
officers
and
shareholders
of
the
corporation
had
no
authority
to
continue
to
represent
the
trustee.
it
is
undisputed
on
this
record
that
the
trustee
played
no
part
in
the
decision
to
file
that
action,
played
no
role
in
the
prosecution
of
that
action.
mr.
frank
m.
wilson
it
would
make
no
difference.
if
you
accept
the
petitioner's
argument
on
the
full
faith
and
credit
action
you
need
go
no
further,
and
there
are
no
other
issues,
because
the
trial
court
was
precluded
regardless
of
anything
else.
i
am
now
making
an
argument
in
case
you
don't
agree
with
me
on
that
issue.
mr.
frank
m.
wilson
yes,
sir.
this
court
has
considered
on
a
number
of
occasions
the
question
of
preclusion
of
nonparties.
due
process,
if
it
requires
anything,
requires
that
a
party,
to
be
precluded,
has
had
an
opportunity
in
the
earlier
litigation
to
bring
forth
his
arguments
and
to
present
the
evidence
that
he
wants
to
present.
there
is
simply
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
the
trustee
was
represented
at
all
in
the
earlier
federal
judgment.
in
fact,
the
only
basis
that
the
court
of
appeals
gives
for
its
decision
affirming
the
injunction
as
to
trustee
is
its
indication
that
the
trustee
should
have
joined
in
the
earlier
federal
action,
and
by
doing
that
he
would
have
had
the
opportunity
to
litigate
his
issues.
i
find
it
very
difficult
indeed
to
understand
the
argument
that
the
other
petitioners,
the
parent
corporation
and
the
shareholders,
are
barred
because
they
split
a
cause
of
action.
that
is
the
basis
for
res
judicata
applying
at
all
to
them,
and
yet
the
argument
is
made
that
the
trustee
is
barred
because
he
did
not
do
the
same
thing.
at
all
times
the
trustee
had
pending
in
state
court
the
legal
issues
that
he
desired
to
raise.
they
were
pending
prior
to
the
adjudication
of
bankruptcy.
when
the
adjudication
of
bankruptcy
occurred,
the
trustee
took
that
property
as
any
other
property
of
the
bankrupt
corporation.
there
was
never
any
indication
in
the
federal
action
that
the
trustee's
interests
were
at
stake.
they
sought
no
damages
on
his
behalf.
the
defendant
in
fact
in
that
case
suggested
that
the
trustee
and
the
bankrupt
corporation
would
be
the
only
ones
who
had
been
damaged.
the
trial
court
continually
denied
that
motion,
denied
that
issue,
and
let
the
case
go
to
trial.
the
eleventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
also
discusses
what
it
deems
the
concept
of
privity.
although
this
court
has
taught
in
its
earlier
decisions
that
that
is
an
ambiguous
term
in
itself,
i
must
argue
that
there
are
no
factors
which
could
support
a
finding
of
privity
in
this
case,
even
if
you
assume
that
is
the
test.
there
was
no
direct
relationship
between
the
trustee
and
the
other
plaintiffs.
that
had
been
severed
by
the
adjudication
of
bankruptcy,
and
if
you
look
to
the
eleventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
decision
on
this
issue,
you
will
note
that
they
make
an
incorrect
factual
assumption,
that
is,
that
this
federal
action
was
pending
at
the
time
of
bankruptcy.
the
federal
action
plaintiffs
made
no
attempt
to
represent
the
trustee,
sought
no
damages
on
his
behalf.
had
they
recovered
in
that
action,
there
would
have
been
no
recovery
for
the
trustee.
in
fact,
the
filing
of
the
action
itself
is
an
indication
that
the
interests
were
different
in
that
they
were
there
pursuing
a
claim
of
their
own.
as
to
the
remaining
plaintiffs,
even
if
this
court
determines
that
the
full
faith
and
credit
action
is
not
a
bar
to
the
injunction,
i
would
suggest
that
the
injunction
is
simply
too
great
an
intrusion
into
the
state
court
system
to
be
justified
by
the
circumstances
presented
by
this
case.
the
argument
has
been
made
that
the
issues
in
state
court
could
have
been
litigated
in
the
earlier
federal
judgments.
that,
i
would
submit
to
the
court,
might
be
a
justification
for
an
injunction
in
an
early
stage
of
the
state
court
proceeding,
before
substantial
judicial
resources
had
been
invested
by
the
state
court,
but
here,
where
the
state
court
has
heard
the
case
on
the
merits,
a
nine-day
trial
has
ensued,
substantial
state
court
judicial
resources
have
been
consumed
in
the
litigation,
i
would
suggest
that
there
would
have
to
be
a
direct
conflict
between
that
earlier
federal
judgment
and
the
current
state
action
in
order
to
justify
in
intrusion
that
great
into
the
state
court
system.
mr.
frank
m.
wilson
certainly.
we
argued
that--
mr.
frank
m.
wilson
--my
argument
there--
mr.
frank
m.
wilson
--atlantic
coastline
in
my
opinion,
justice
white,
would
form
a
better
set
of
circumstances
to
justify
an
injunction
than
this
case
does.
atlantic
coastline
there--
mr.
frank
m.
wilson
--it
did
in
fact,
and
it
said
that
because
the...
as
i
read
atlantic
coastline,
the
state
issues
had
never
been
heard.
there
could
be
no
direct
conflict
between
a
resolution
of
those
issues
and
a
resolution
of
a
federal
issue
that
said
that
there
was...
if
in
fact
that
is
what
the
federal
court
resolved,
which
of
course
is
a
question
that
was
ultimately
determined
in
atlantic
coastline,
then
there
would
be
no
direct
conflict
between
those
issues,
and
i
would
suggest
that
because
of
the
policy
considerations
here
and
the
desire
to
limit
intrusion
into
the
state
court,
you
should
limit
an
injunction
there
to
a
situation
where
you
are
going
to
have
a
direct
conflict
between
those
decisions
so
that
a
party
cannot
comply,
for
example,
with
both
courts.
mr.
frank
m.
wilson
are
you
assuming
that
he
litigates
those
and
then
files
a
state
court
action?
mr.
frank
m.
wilson
i
think
there
are
circumstances
under
which
atlantic
coastline
would
not
prohibit
an
injunction
if
it
was
a
clear
case.
mr.
frank
m.
wilson
assuming
there
is
some
appearance
that
he
did
that
intentionally
to
get
the
"two
bites
at
the
apple"
other
than...
i
see
a
different
circumstance
here--
mr.
frank
m.
wilson
--i
think
that
there
are
two
distinct
questions
to
be
decided.
one
is
ultimately
whether
collateral
estoppel
or
res
judicata
will
apply,
and
the
second
is,
should
a
federal
court
enjoin
a
state
court
proceeding.
i
think
there
has
got
to
be
more
than
the
mere
fact
that
res
judicata
and
collateral
estoppel
might
apply
or
even
would
apply
to
justify
an
intrusion
into
the
state
court
system,
so
i
would
suppose
that
i
would
answer
your
question,
yes,
he
could,
assuming
there
was
no
more
to
justify
the
injunction
than
the
mere
fact
that
arguably
he
could
have
joined
those
issues
and
it
would
therefore
be
res
judicata.
with
the
court's
permission,
i
will
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
frank
m.
wilson
in
that
one
minute,
i
would
like
to
make
just
one
point.
we
do
not
concede
that
under
alabama
law
the
judgment
in
the
state
court
was
not
final.
i
apologize
to
justice
o'connor
for
a
poor
answer
to
her
question.
the
scott
versus
lane
case
stands
for
the
proposition
that
authorities
in
the
federal
court
interpreting
the
rules
of
federal
procedure
are
followed
by
alabama
as
a
matter
of
procedure.
it
is
not
a
case
on
the
substantive
law
of
res
judicata
in
alabama.
so
i
do
not
concede,
i
do
not
have
any
authority
to
offer
the
court,
but
i
do
not
concede
that
point.
secondly,
the
trustee--
mr.
frank
m.
wilson
--yes.
mr.
frank
m.
wilson
if
the
only
issue
this
court
feels
constitutes
reversible
error
is
the
full
faith
and
credit
issue,
yes,
justice
stevens,
that
is
correct.
if
you
agree
with
me
on
my
arguments
concerning
the
anti-injunction
statute,
then
there
would
be
no
need
for
them
to
determine
that
issue.
i
thank
the
court
for
its
attention.
