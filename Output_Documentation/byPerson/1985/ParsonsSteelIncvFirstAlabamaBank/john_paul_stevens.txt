justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
there,
do
you
agree
that
the
preclusive
effect
of
the
federal
judgment
was
a
federal
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question
about
when
the
timing...
if
i
understand,
for
purposes
of
your
full
faith
and
credit
argument,
if
the
injunction
had
issued
before
the
state
court
judgment
had
entered,
it
would
be
permissible.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
your
point
is
that
it
was
after
the
judgment
but
before
the
posttrial
motions
were
ruled
on.
and
it
was
too
late.
what
if
the
federal
injunction
had
issued
after
the
summary
judgment
motion
had
been
denied
but
before
the
jury
came
in
with
a
verdict?
that
is
when
the
trial
court
actually
made
its
legal
analysis
for
the
first
time,
i
guess.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
nachman,
may
i
interrupt
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
have
explained
why
you
had
to
assert
the
defense
in
the
state
court
proceeding,
but
i
am
still
not
quite
clear
on
why,
having
asserted
it
in
your
pleadings,
and
maybe
even
in
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
whatever
it
be,
why
you
could
not
have
then
forthwith
gone
into
federal
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
surely
had
that
when
the
state
judge
denied
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
were
probably
pretty
busy
those
few
days,
i
guess,
if
you
were
about
to
go
to
trial,
but
i
don't
understand.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that
all
of
your
arguments
might
explain
waiting
until
whatever
the
date
was,
some
time
in
january,
when
the
summary
judgment
was
ruled
on,
but
i
would
think
right
after
that
your
claim
would
have
been
totally
ripe.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
they
also
on
219
said,
"the
court
further
finds
that
neither
res
judicata
nor
collateral
estoppel
precludes
the
prosecution
of
the
instant
claim.
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
that
order
had
been
entered,
you
surely
were
on
notice
that
you
were
going
to
lose
on
those
issues
in
that
court,
weren't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
federal
judgment
was
not
final.
may
i
go
back
to
one
other
question?
justice
rehnquist
asked
you
earlier
about
the
toucey
case
and
justice
reed's
dissent
there,
which
surely
provides
an
answer
to
the
anti-injunction
act,
but
i
am
not
clear
on
why
you
are
so
confident
that
that
provides
an
answer
to
the
full
faith
and
credit
problem,
because
even
though
it
is
correct,
as
you
point
out,
that
there
was
a
judgment
entered
in
the
subsequent
state
proceeding
in
the
wisconsin
bridge
case,
justice
reed
didn't
rely
on
that
at
all.
or
he
didn't
discuss
that
problem.
he
doesn't
even
discuss
the
full
faith
and
credit
problem,
if
i
understand
his
opinion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
justice
frankfurter
didn't
rely
on
those
facts
at
all.
justice
reed's
opinion
just
says
litigation
was
commenced
in
the
state
courts.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
it
going
to
judgment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
it
would
have
to
be
exercised
before
judgment,
is
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
it
would
just
have
to
be
exercised
before
judgment.
i
mean,
under
your
view,
as
i
understand
it,
you
could
litigate
this
through
the
state
supreme
court
system
and
finally
lose
on
res
judicata
and
say,
well,
now,
i
will
take
a
shot
at
the
federal
court,
and
enjoin
the
enforcement
of
judgment
now
that
it
is
really
final.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
on
that
point--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
you
are
right
on
everything
else,
isn't
the
correct
disposition
if
you
win
to
send
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
decide
whether
or
not
as
a
matter
of
alabama
law
the
judgment
has
preclusive
effect?
