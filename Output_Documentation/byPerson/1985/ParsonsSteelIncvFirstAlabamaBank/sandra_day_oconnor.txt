day

mr.
wilson,
would
you
be
good
enough
to
tell
us
if
the
record
reflects
when
the
state
court
decided
the
respondent's
post-trial
motions,
and
when
the
appeal
was
filed?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
the
respondents
take
the
position
that
the
state
court's
res
judicata
determination
was
not
final
at
the
time
that
the
federal
injunction
issued.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
i
couldn't
find
dates
in
the
record
to
know
whether
that
has
some
validity
or
not.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
so
you
agree--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--with
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
wilson,
now,
is
a
nonfinal
judgment
given
preclusive
effect
under
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
concede
that
this
was
not
a
final
judgment.
procedurally
and
technically
i
do
concede
that,
although
there
had
certainly
been
substantial...
substantial
resources
had
been
expended
in
preparing
that
judgment.
well,
would
you
say
that
if
the
people,
your
opponents
had
appealed
the
judgment
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama,
and
while
the
appeal
was
pending
it
would
still
be
a
nonfinal
judgment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
so
when
you
are
talking
about
a
final
judgment,
you
are
talking
about
how
the
alabama
court
system
would
view
that
particular...
what
if
a
judgment
had
gone
exactly
as
far
as
the
one
in
which
your
client
participated
in
the
alabama
court
system?
would
the
alabama
courts
have
treated
it
as
a
binding
judgment
for
res
judicata
purposes
under
state
law?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
wilson,
would
you
tell
me,
because
i
am
not
sure
if
you
did
before,
and
i
want
to
get
back
to
my
question,
the
respondents
cite
an
alabama
case
for
the
proposition
that
the
making
of
a
judgment...
of
a
motion
post-judgment
for
a
new
trial
or
a
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
means
the
judgment
in
alabama
law
is
not
final
for
purposes
of
res
judicata.
they
cited
a
case
of
scott
versus
lane.
now,
how
do
you
distinguish
the
case,
or
what
authority
do
you
cite
for
the
contrary
proposition?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
don't
have
contrary
opinions
of
the
alabama
court
to
cite
to
us
on
this
point?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
say
that
that
is
true
even
if
there
were
a
final
judgment
in
the
state
court
before
the
application
to
the
federal
court
for
the
injunction?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
ucc
action
was
different,
wasn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
if
we
disagree
with
you
on
your
reading
of
whether
toucey
can
be
distinguished,
and
what
if
we
think
that
if
the
state
court
judgment
is
final,
that
toucey
is
distinguishable,
and
congress
did
not
intend
to
prevent
the
application
of
full
faith
and
credit?
