justice
byron
r.
white
what
relief
was
sought
in
the
federal
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
judgment
was
on
the
state
matters.
justice
byron
r.
white
a
recovery
on
state
law
grounds?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
are
you
saying
was
the
binding
state
ruling
that
the
federal
court
ignored?
what
are
you
saying?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
state
law
issues?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
be
arguing
the
same
thing
even
if
the
affirmative
defense
had
never
been
presented
and
ruled
on.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
the
state
court
may
finally
determine
the
federal
question--
justice
byron
r.
white
--in
a
way
that
the
federal
court
must
observe,
must
respect.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
you
would
say
then
that
the
federal
court
could
have
enjoined
the
state
action
before
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes--
justice
byron
r.
white
--it
is
only
when
they
rule
finally
on
the
res
judicata
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
that
a
federal
court
might
have
concluded
before
judgment
in
the
state
court
that
as
a
federal
matter,
that
state
court
judgment
should
not...
that
state
court
suit
should
not
proceed
to
judgment,
and
it
would
have
been,
as
far
as
the
full
faith
and
credit
act
was
concerned,
that
was
a
permissible
ruling,
and
it
involves
a
ruling
on
a
federal
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
next
day,
in
a
similar
action,
if
the
federal
court
waits
until
after
judgment
and
the
state
court
rules
quite
contrary
to
the
federal
court's
view
yesterday,
the
federal
court
must
still
observe
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
in
my
first
example
where
the
federal
court
issued
the
injunction
before
the
judgment
in
the
state
court,
suppose
there
is
an
appeal,
and
it
comes
up
to
this
court,
and
this
court
rules
that
in
these
circumstances,
in
these
circumstances,
on
the
federal
issue,
any
further
litigation
is
precluded
because
the
state
cause
of
action
should
have
been
presented
in
the
federal
case?
then
we
say
just
as
a
federal
matter
here
is
the
rule
in
this
case.
could
the
state
then
ignore
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
federal
injunction
in
my
first
example
is
appealed
up
here,
and
we
say,
well,
that
is
quite
right,
as
a
federal
matter
that
federal
judgment
precludes
any
further
litigation
on
issues
arising
out
of
the
same
facts,
period.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
yes,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
an
injunction
issued,
but
it
is
before
judgment
in
the
state
court.
and
that
injunction
is
challenged,
and
it
comes
up
here
through
the
court
of
appeals.
it
is
affirmed,
and
it
comes
here,
and
we
affirm.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
in
the
next
case
on
very
similar
facts
except
that
the
federal
court
doesn't
issue
its
injunction
until
after
the
state
court
rules
and
says
there
is
no
res
judicata?
doesn't
the
state
court
in
that
situation
have
to
respect
this
court's
ruling
on
the
federal
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
you
say
that
our
problem
here
is
just
to
rule
on
the
full
faith
and
credit
act,
and
not
on
the
merits
of
the
federal
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
we
should
not
ever
reach
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see,
so
if
the
state
court
made
a
mistake,
it
should
come
up
through
the
state
system
and
then
come
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
a
little
bit
different
argument
than
you
have
been
making,
because
up
until
now
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
whether
he
was
party
to
the
federal
suit
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
before
you
leave
that
other,
do
posttrial
motions
challenge
the
ruling
on
the
res
judicata
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
argue
that
the
court
was
just
wrong
in
saying
there
was
res
judicata
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
you
can
withhold
your
state
causes
of
action
if
you
want
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
atlantic
coastline?
justice
byron
r.
white
atlantic
said
no,
did
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
atlantic
coastline
stands
for
the
proposition
that
plaintiff,
like
in
this
case,
can
go
in
and
litigate
his
federal
bank
holding
company
issues
and
if
he
loses
or
if
he
wins,
he
still
is
free
to
go
into
the
state
court
on
his
state
causes
of
action.
there
is
no...
is
he
free
to
go
ahead
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
could
have
joined
it
on
just...
with
his
federal
claim.
he
could
have.
he
could
have
tried
to,
anyway.
but
he
didn't.
he
said,
i'd
rather
litigate
my
state
causes
of
action
in
the
state
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
assume
collateral
estoppel
might
apply
on
issues
that
were
actually
litigated,
but
do
you
think
there
would
be
just
res
judicata,
just
claim
preclusion?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
win
on
your...
suppose
you
win
on
your
full
faith
and
credit
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
still
have
the
question
of
whether
the
federal
court
is
right
in
saying
that
the
federal
judgment
should
preclude
further
state
litigation.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
either.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
said
he
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
seems
to
me
that
the
validity
of
the
injunction
rests
not
only...
depends
not
only
on
the
full
faith
and
credit
act,
but
on
whether
they
were
right
on
saying
it
was
res
judicata.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
think
we
ought
to
do
if
we
thought
that
under
our
cases
the
two
courts
below
were
wholly
wrong
in
deciding
that
the
federal
issue
barred
further
litigation
on
the
state
causes
of
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
from
the
federal
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
entertaining
pendent
state
causes
of
action...
these
were
pendent,
weren't
they,
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
they
weren't,
but
they
could
have
been
pendent?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
does
the
federal
district
court
have
to
entertain
a
pendent
cause
of
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
this
court
say
about
they
the
injunction
wasn't
issued
by
the
federal
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
and
why
was
it
denied?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
and
furthermore
because
there
just
shouldn't
be
injunctions.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
sounds
to
me
that
is
sort
of
like
why
this
federal
judgment
should
have
any
preclusive
effect
at
all,
because
ultimately
all
that
happened
was
that
the
appellate
court
ruled
that
there
was
no
cause
of...
there
was
just,
as
a
matter
of
law,
just
no
violation
of
the
bank
holding
company
act.
why
should
that
preclude
anything?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
to
say
that
that
is
the
federal
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
res
judicata,
that
if
you
can...
that
you
either
raise
your
pendent
state
law
claims
in
the
federal
action
or
you
are
going
to
be
foreclosed.
