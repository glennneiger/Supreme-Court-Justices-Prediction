mr.
raymond
cross
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
matter
is
before
this
court
for
the
second
time
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
north
dakota.
this
case
squarely
presents
the
issue
left
undecided
by
this
court
in
its
previous
decision
in
this
matter.
that
issue
is
whether
a
state
may
enact
a
statute
barring
tribal
indians
but
not
non-indians,
from
state
court
for
hearing
damage
actions
against
non-indian
defendants
in
state
court.
respondent,
wold
engineering,
urges
this
court
to
uphold
the
state
statute
that
bars
all
tribal
indians
residing
on
the
four
reservations
in
north
dakota
from
access
to
state
court
for
the
enforcement
of
their
damages
actions
against
non-indians.
this
court
previously
held
in
this
matter
that
such
a
state
statute
is
not
required
nor
authorized
by
federal
law,
particularly
public
law
280,
as
a
measure
to
protect
the
tribal
indians
in
the
area
of
their
rights.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
simple.
this
case
involves
a
breach
of
contract
and
negligence
action
for
damages
brought
by
the
three
affiliated
tribes
against
wold
engineering,
a
non-indian
firm
in
north
dakota.
this
action
arose
on
the
fort
berthold
indian
reservation.
in
1974,
the
three
affiliated
tribes
contracted
with
wold
engineering
to
design
and
build
a
water
supply
system
known
as
the
four
bears
water
supply
system
on
the
fort
berthold
reservation.
however,
in
1977,
after
the
project
was
completed,
the
tribes
discovered
that
the
project
failed
to
supply
a
safe
and
continuous
water
supply
to
the
portion
of
the
reservation
people
it
was
intended
to
serve.
despite
efforts
at
correction
by
wold
engineering,
the
project
never
functioned
properly
and
in
1980
the
three
affiliated
tribes
commenced
this
action
in
the
state
district
court
for
the
northwest
judicial
district
of
north
dakota.
the
trial
court,
upon
wold's
motion,
dismissed
the
tribes'
complaint,
holding
that
actions
arising
on
the
indian
reservations
in
north
dakota
brought
by
tribal
members
cannot
be
enforced
against
non-indian
defendants.
in
1982,
the
north
dakota
supreme
court
affirmed
the
trial
court's
judgment
and
held
that
actions
arising
on
the
reservations
and
brought
by
tribal
indians
against
non-indians
cannot
be
heard
in
state
court
because
of
a
state
disclaimer
known
as
the
indian
civil
jurisdiction
act
of
1963,
as
well
as
the
influence
of
public
law
280
ousted
the
state
court
from
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
this
court
granted
the
tribe
the
first
petition
for
certiorari
and
after
hearing
reversed...
pardon
me,
vacated
the
judgment
of
the
north
dakota
supreme
court,
holding
that
public
law
280
neither
authorized
nor
required
such
a
jurisdictional
bar
to
tribal
indians'
access
to
state
court.
further,
the
supreme
court,
this
court,
remanded
the
case
for
further
proceedings
in
light
of
the
supreme
court's
holding
that
this
matter
should
be
scrutinized
by
the
court
below
for
possible
constitutional
infirmities
and
further
that
chapter
27-19
was
not
authorized
by
public
law
280
or
any
other
federal
law
as
a
jurisdictional
disclaimer
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
in
this
category
of
actions.
the
court
below
on
remand
held
that
the
matter
of
state
law
alone,
that
indians,
tribal
indians,
residing
on
the
reservation
were
barred
from
maintaining
these
actions.
the
reason
for
this
barrier
arises
from
the
state
jurisdictional
statute,
known
as
the
indian
civil
jurisdiction
statute
of
1963,
and
that
this
state
law
alone
barred
the
tribal
indians
access
to
state
court
in
these
cases.
mr.
raymond
cross
unless,
justice,
the
consent
to
the
full
extension...
that
is
unless
the
tribal
indians
either
collectively
as
a
tribal
group
or
individually
consent
to
the
full
extension
of
state
civil
jurisdiction
over
the
pertinent
property.
the
only
exception
to
this
extension
would
be
that
the
state
court's
power
to
levy
and
execute
on
tribal
property
may
be
exempted
by
state
or
federal
law.
mr.
raymond
cross
that
is
right.
the
waiver
would
have
the
jurisdictional
effect
of
conferring
general
judicial
jurisdiction
on
the
court
for
all
cases.
that
would
be
true
whether
the
consenting
indian
was
a
tribal
government
or
whether
the
indian
was
an
individual
seeking
to
pursue
a
damage
action
in
state
court,
justice.
mr.
raymond
cross
justice
o'connor,
as
we
conceded
in
this
court
in
the
previous
hearing
in
this
matter,
the
three
affiliated
tribes
would
be
subject
to
the
counterclaim
of
the
respondent,
wold
engineering,
up
to
the
extent
of
jurisdictional--
mr.
raymond
cross
--as
a
setoff.
mr.
raymond
cross
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
cross
the
three
affiliated
tribes
believe
it
would
be
proper
in
the
interest
of
justice
that
they
would
be
subject
to
discovery
proceedings
and
to
proceedings
that
would
insure
a
fair
trial
to
the
non-indian
defendants.
mr.
raymond
cross
i
think,
your
honor,
if
the
statute
had
the
purpose
of
insuring
that
a
fair
trial
would
be
provided
to
the
non-indian
defendant
and
that
if
the
plaintiff,
the
tribe,
would
not
conform
to
such
requirements,
then,
i
think,
yes,
the
state
court
would
be
entitled
to
dismiss
that
suit
in
the
interest
of
justice.
mr.
raymond
cross
just
the
three
affiliated
tribes.
mr.
raymond
cross
the
consent
issue
did
not
finally
become
crystallized
until
the
final
decision
by
the
north
dakota
supreme
court.
in
other
words,
the
presumption
had
been,
and
it
appeared
under
state
law
prior
to
the
decision
in
wold
ii,
that
the
consent
did
not
bar
tribal
indians,
including
tribal
governments,
from
suing
non-indians
in
state
court.
it
was
after
the
state
supreme
court
took
a
second
look
at
the
jurisdictional
effect
of
the
state
statute
that
they
held
that
the
intent
was
to
completely
bar
tribal
indians,
including
suits
against
non-indians
for
the
enforcement
of
damages.
mr.
raymond
cross
that
is
correct.
mr.
raymond
cross
justice
white,
the
present
law
on
tribal
sovereign
immunity
should
be
respected
and
the--
mr.
raymond
cross
--the
counterclaim
can
be
heard
up
to
the
extent
of
a
recoupment
or
equitable
setoff.
mr.
raymond
cross
not
under
the
law
of
tribal
sovereign
immunity
as
it
now
stands,
justice.
mr.
raymond
cross
yes,
that
is
our
view
of
the
doctrine
as
explained
by
this
court.
mr.
raymond
cross
if
a
state
statute
was
drafted
that
narrowly
and
it
had
that
purpose
and
intent
to
make
sure
that
the
tribal
governments
were
subject
to
counterclaims,
then
that
would
present
a
different
issue.
here
the
court
below--
mr.
raymond
cross
--i
believe
that
that
requirement,
requiring
the
tribes
to
waive
their
tribal
sovereign
immunity
is
the
bases
for
maintaining
a
damage
of
action
should
not
be
allowed
under
the
present
doctrine
of
tribal
sovereignty.
mr.
raymond
cross
that
is
correct.
the
statute
that
we
have
here--
mr.
raymond
cross
--if
that
statute
was
applied
to
non-residents
and
required
such
a
posting
to
make
sure
that
the
case
could
be
conducted
fairly,
then
i
think
they
may
be
able
to
do
that,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
cross
yes.
mr.
raymond
cross
the
statute
at
issue
here
bars
all
tribal
indians,
not
just
tribal
governments,
from
access
to
state
court.
if
there
were
provisions
of
that
statute
which
provided
for
insurance
of
fairness
to
the
non-indian
defendant,
such
as
the
doctrine
of
forum
non
conveniens,
the
tribe
would
have
no
objection
to
administration,
court
administration
of
justice,
that
made
sure
that
the
adjudication
of
the
non-indians'
claim
as
against
tribal
indians
and
individuals
was
fair.
however,
when
a
state
statute
completely
bars
all
of
the
tribal
indians,
regardless
of
the
merits
of
the
claim,
regardless
of
whether
issues
of
sovereign
immunity
are
directly
presented
by
the
case
or
not,
then
such
a
state
statute,
i
believe,
is
overbroad
and
the
reason
why
it
is
overbroad
is
because
it
interferes
with
basic
rights
of
due
process,
it
interferes
with
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
tribal
indians
were
recognized
in
1957,
under
the
state
decision
known
as
vermillion
v.
spotted
elk,
to
have
the
right
of
access
under
the
open
courts
provision
of
the
state
constitution
and
under
state
judicial
precedent
to
sue
for
the
enforcement
of
damages
action
in
state
court.
mr.
raymond
cross
the
reason,
justice
rehnquist,
that
i
think
this
court
should
go
further
and
examine
the
case
of
individual
indians
is
because
if
this
statute
is
allowed
to
stand
as
construed,
will
bar
in
the
future
until
the
statute
is
either
amended
or
rescinded
all
tribal
indians
from
access
to
state
court.
mr.
raymond
cross
i
believe
that
this
is
an
equal
protection
and
due
process
case
as
well
in
that
the
rights
of
the
tribal
people
had
to
maintain
damages
actions
in
state
court
have
now
been
taken
away
from
them,
not
just
tribal
governments,
not
just
a
reasonable
constraint
on
the
exercise
of--
mr.
raymond
cross
--i
think
it
is
even
more
compelling
in
this
case,
justice,
because
the
indian
tribe
acts
on
behalf
of
its
tribal
people.
if
the
access
to
state
court
for
the
reasonable
enforcement
of
their
damages
claim
is
completely
taken
away,
it
is
not
just
the
tribe
per
se
that
is
going
to
suffer,
but
the
individuals
as
well.
mr.
raymond
cross
i
think
the
case
is
stronger
in
the
sense
that
the
construction
of
the
state
statute
bars
all
tribal
plaintiffs
and
if
the
statute
stands
it
will
continue
to
bar
the
plaintiffs
in
the
future.
the
reason
why
i
think
that
the
tribal
government
should
be
able
to
assert
those
rights
and
to
bring
that
focus
to
the
scope
of
the
statute
is
because
the
tribal
government
is
a
representative
of
the
indian
people
and
many
times
has
the
only
wherewithal
to
challenge
statutes
such
as
these
that
are
unfair.
mr.
raymond
cross
the
tribe
and
indian
individuals,
when
they
filed
in
state
court,
are
subject
to
the
procedural
restriction,
and,
as
i
mentioned
before,
the
reasonable
procedural
restriction
that
insures
a
fair
trial.
just
as
the
united
states,
when
it
sues
in
state
court,
if
they
fail
to
comply
with
the
restrictions
that
apply
to
everyone
bringing
the
suit
and
the
maintaining
of
the
suit,
that
the
case
can
be
dismissed
for
those
reasons.
the
questions
as
i
understand
them
today
center
on
whether
or
not
a
state
court
or
a
state
could
pass
a
statute
allowing
the
enforcement
of
affirmative
relief
against--
mr.
raymond
cross
--the
tribe--
mr.
raymond
cross
--the
tribe
as
a
governmental
entity
is
similarly
situation,
i
believe,
in
the
sense
that
they
are
willing
to
go
into
state
court
and
be
bound
by
all
the
reasonable
procedural
restrictions,
just
as
the
united
states
when
they
sue
in
state
court
will
be
bound.
the
only
difference
between
the
tribe
and
the
non-indian
plaintiff
that
wished
to
sue
is
that
the
tribe,
along
with
all
of
the
tribal
indians,
are
barred
from
that
court,
so
that
we
don't
reach
the
further
question
of
what
sort
of
constraints
could
be
placed
on
the
tribe's
appearance.
so,
it
seems
to
me--
mr.
raymond
cross
--yes.
and,
if
they
can
maintain
that
counterclaim,
that
counterclaim
can
be
heard
to
the
extent
of
a
recoupment
or
equitable--
mr.
raymond
cross
--that
is
correct.
mr.
raymond
cross
for
purposes
of
equal
protection,
i
think
there
may
be
difficulties
in
comparing
indian
tribes
to
non-indian
plaintiffs,
however,
the
other
facet
of
the
due
process
claim
requires
the
court
be
open
on
a
reasonable
basis.
the
tribes
are
willing
to
go
into
state
court
and
be
bound
by
all
of
the
procedural
restrictions,
be
bound
by
res
judicata,
be
bound
by
all
of
those
elements
that
make
for
a
fair
trial.
the
only
difference
being
is
that
an
indian
tribe
is
not
a
non-indian
plaintiff.
it
cannot
be
sued
except
with
its
consent,
except
to
the
extent
for
equitable
setoff
or
recoupment.
mr.
raymond
cross
the
tribe
has
altered
its
laws
and
a
suit
would
be
possible
in
the
sense
that
the
tribal
code
now
recognizes
jurisdiction
over
non-indians.
so
that
the
tribal
government
could
proceed
against
wold
engineering
or
a
party
like
wold
engineering
in
tribal
court.
the
problem
is
that
the
state
of
north
dakota
in
a
case
entitled
lowe
v.
cloud
does
not
recognize
the
enforceability
of
tribal
court
judgments
from
state
courts.
consequently,
a
situation
where
a
non-indian
defendant
is
a
non-resident
of
the
reservation,
has
no
assets
on
the
reservation,
there
would
be
serious
question
about
the
efficacy
of
such
a
proceeding.
mr.
raymond
cross
no,
your
honor.
there
was
a
case
somewhat
similar
to
this
called
chance
v.
white
lightening
and
that
involved
an
effort
to
sue,
first,
in
federal
district
court,
in
light
of
this
decision,
in
light
of
the
wold
i
decision
in
state
court.
there,
the
facts
involved
simply
a
tort
action,
as
i
recall,
and
the
federal
district
courts,
being
courts
of
limited
jurisdiction,
held
that
there
was
no
subject-matter
jurisdiction.
mr.
raymond
cross
your
honor,
there
is
a
special
section
that
allows
indian
tribes
to
sue,
however,
that
does
not
address
the
issue
of
subject-matter
jurisdiction.
there
are
still
subject
to
the
federal
question
and
to
other
limitations
on
federal
court
jurisdiction.
consequently,
if
a
tribe
attempted
to
bring
a
contract
action
of
this
sort
in
federal
district
court
or
the
appropriate
federal
court,
that
they
would
still
be
subject
to
the
limitation
that
this
question
must
be
cognizable
under
the
judicial
power
the
federal
courts
have.
and,
as
i
understand
it,
a
mere
contract
action,
a
mere
breach
of
contract
action,
a
negligence
action,
would
not
present
federal
questions.
it
would
be
simply
a
run-of-the-mill
contract
action
that
should
be
appropriately
heard
in
state
court.
mr.
raymond
cross
there
is
no
diversity
here,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
cross
based
on
the
decisions
that
i
have
read,
your
honor,
28
u.s.c.
1362,
i
believe,
that
allows
tribes
to
sue
in
federal
court
relates
only
to
their
personal
right
to
sue
free
of
some
limitations.
however,
the
subject--
mr.
raymond
cross
--i
don't
believe
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
cross
the
provision
allows
indian
tribes
to
come
in
and
sue
and--
mr.
raymond
cross
--i
think
in
a
sense
that
the
federal
statute
opening
the
federal
courts
to
the
indian
tribes
simply
confirms
existing
law.
this
court
has
previously
held
in
cases
before
that
statute
was
enacted
that
indian
tribes
have
the
capacity
to
maintain
a
legal
action
in
their
own
right.
mr.
raymond
cross
i
think
the
statute
within
the
limits
that
it
functions
is
important,
but
i
don't
think
it
would
allow
the
indian
tribes
to
come
and
sue
in
federal
district
court
on
matters
of
this
kind.
mr.
raymond
cross
on
solely
a
state
law
question
except
in
a
diversity
situation.
this
statute,
as
we
have
said
before,
excludes
all
tribal
indians
on
the
four
reservations
in
north
dakota
from
access
to
state
court.
now,
the
state
court
previously,
in
a
decision
entitled
vermillion
v.
spotted
elk,
had
held
that
indian
tribes
or
at
least
indian
individuals
were
entitled
to
enforce
their
rights
in
state
court.
however,
in
1963,
the
state
enacted
the
indian
civil
jurisdiction
act.
that
statute
has
been
construed
by
the
state
court
below
of
barring
tribal
indians
from
access
until
they
consent
to
the
extension
of
the
state
civil
jurisdiction
over
their
person
and
property
on
the
reservation.
now,
this
consent
goes
far
beyond
the
issue
at
hand
in
the
particular
case
of
whether
wold
engineering
may
or
may
not
maintain
a
counterclaim.
it
would
subject
the
tribe
and
the
consenting
individuals
under
section
27-19-05
of
the
state
statute
to
general
state
judicial
jurisdiction
for
all
cases
as
a
condition
for
maintaining
this
one
damages
action
against
a
non-indian
in
state
court.
it
would
also
confer
on
the
state
the
authority
to
legislate
in
a
variety
of
subject-matter
areas
in
contract,
in
divorce,
in
guardianships,
in
other
areas
not
limited
to
those
subject-matter
categories
that
are
now
presently
reserved
to
tribal
regulation.
so
that
the
design
and
purpose
of
the
statute,
as
construed
by
the
court
below,
is
to
completely
bar
tribal
indians
from
maintaining
these
actions
unless
they
consent
to
the
extension
of
state
civil
jurisdiction
for
virtually
all
purposes,
the
only
exception
being
that
the
state
may
not
use
their
enforcement
powers
to
levy
or
execute
on
tribal
indian
property
unless
it
is
authorized
by
federal
or
state
law.
we
believe...
the
tribes
believe
and
have
argued
in
their
brief
that
such
restrictions
on
the
civil
rights
of
tribal
indians,
the
restriction
on
due
process
rights
of
tribal
indians,
requires
a
special
justification.
it
requires
special
justification
because
the
matter
peeves
two
issues
of
indian
ancestry
and
indian
identity.
there
is
no
other
bases
for
the
state
statute.
this
court,
in
its
prior
decision
in
this
matter,
said
that
the
state
statute
was
not
required
by
federal
law
to
protect
the
rights
of
tribal
indians
in
the
sense
of
the
pre-emption
doctrine;
that
this
statute
did
not
require
a
governing
federal
law
under
public
law
280.
consequently,
the
state
statute
bars
a...
bears
a
heavy
burden
of
justification
to
allow
it
to
stand
to
restrict
all
tribal
indians
from
maintaining
the
action
in
state
court.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
time.
mr.
raymond
cross
i
believe
that
there
has
been
one
or
two
in
the
history
of
the
state
legislature.
mr.
raymond
cross
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
to
point
out
that
the
tribal
courts
are
open
to
non-indian
plaintiffs
and
many
non-indian
plaintiffs
for
debt
collection
and
other
purpose
take
advantage
of
the
tribal
courts
to
maintain
actions
precisely
of
the
kind
that
are
at
stake
here.
however,
by
contrast,
the
state
courts
are
not
open
to
tribal
indians
or
tribal
governments
unless
they
consent
to
the
extension
or
virtually
complete
state
civil
jurisdiction
over
the
person
or
property.
the
tribes
believe
that
that
infringes
on
their
due
process
and
equal
protection
rights
and
as
well
it
would
interfere
with
operation
of
fundamentally
important
federal
policies
governing
the
indian
affairs
area.
first
of
all,
it
would
interfere
with
the
doctrine
of
the
protection
of
the
political
independence
of
the
tribes
and
the
economic
independence
of
the
tribes.
if
such
a
state
statute
is
allowed
to
stand,
it
means
that
individuals
will
be
compelled
to
consent
to
the
extension
of
state
civil
jurisdiction,
not
only
for
the
purpose
of
the
case
at
hand,
but
for
extension
of
state
legislative
and
judicial
jurisdiction
generally
except
as
limited
by
terms
i
of
the
statute.
that
would
fundamentally
impair
how
the
tribes
operate
under
federal
law.
the
result
of
such
a
state
statute
would
be
the
creation
of
a
checkerboard
jurisdictional
system
unknown
now
in
federal
indian
law.
individuals
would
be
compelled...
individuals
tribal
members,
including
governments,
would
be
compelled
to
commit
themselves
to
accepting
state
civil
jurisdiction
generally.
mr.
raymond
cross
under
the
doctrines
of
this
court,
justice
marshall,
the
individuals
have
a
right
known
as
the
williams
v.
lee
right.
our
position
is
that
if
the
state
court
otherwise
has
subject-matter
jurisdiction
over
a
tribal
member's
complaint,
not
a
tribal
government
complaint,
but
a
tribal
member's
complaint,
that
there
may
be
the
possibility
that
the
non-indian
can
maintain
their
damages
action
or
the
counterclaim
against
an
individual
tribal
member
but
not
against
a
tribal
government.
mr.
raymond
cross
i
may
not
have
answered
your
question
justice
marshall.
mr.
raymond
cross
the
answer
to
your
question
is
that
the
individual
indian
cannot
waive
the
tribal
governmental
sovereignty.
at
most,
through
the
individual
consent
procedure
27-19-05,
it
can
submit
himself...
the
individual
can
submit
himself
to
the
full
scope
of
state
jurisdiction.
what
would
happen
in
the
usual
case,
and
this
has
already
been
tried
in
state
court,
is
that
the
individual
would
have
to
consent,
the
individual
tribal
member
would
have
to
consent,
perhaps
as
a
basis
of
extension
of
credit,
on
the
reservation
by
a
non-indian.
so,
you
would
have
a
system
in
which,
as
a
usual
matter,
the
non-indian
would
become
subject
to
an
unclear
area
of
law.
on
the
one
hand,
they
have
submitted
themselves
under
the
state
civil
jurisdiction.
on
the
other
hand,
tribal
government
would
assert
that
they
have
the
right
to--
mr.
raymond
cross
--the
individual,
justice
marshall,
is
that
they
cannot
waive
tribal
sovereignty.
the
state
statute
appears
to
force
the
individual
to
come
in
to,
if
they
want
access
to
state
court,
to
submit
themselves
individually
to
all
of
the
state
legislative
powers.
so,
a
tribal
indian
as
he
tries
for
access
to
state
court
must
say
through
a
written
statement,
through
an
executed
statement
with
the
county
auditor
where
he
resides,
that
he
is
going
to
accept
state
jurisdiction;
that
he
is
going
to
accept
state
jurisdiction
for
virtually
all
purposes.
and,
that
is
why
we
believe
this
state
statute
interferes
not
only
with
the
established
due
process
rights
of
the
tribal
members
involved,
but
also
would
frustrate
the
operation
of
fundamental
federal
policies.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
