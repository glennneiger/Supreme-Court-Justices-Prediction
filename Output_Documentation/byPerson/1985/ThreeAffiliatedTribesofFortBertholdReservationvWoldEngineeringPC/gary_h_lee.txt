mr.
gary
h.
lee
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
north
dakota
legislative
plan,
chapter
27-19
of
the
north
dakota
century
code,
a
1963
jurisdictional
act,
which
mr.
cross
refers
to,
and
the
north
dakota
supreme
court's
decision
in
this
case,
and
wold
engineering,
all
seek
precisely
the
same
thing
and
that
is
equal
justice
for
everyone
under
the
law.
the
current
situation
in
north
dakota
guarantees
to
everyone
that
equal
access.
three
tribes
and
mr.
cross
argues
here
today
that
somehow
indian
litigants
or
tribal
litigants
is
being
denied
access
to
a
court
in
situations
where
others
have
that
access
and
that
is
simply
not
so.
in
the
case
of
an
indian...
in
all
cases,
where
the
facts
are
the
same,
the
access
of
the
litigants
is
the
same.
if
you
have
a
situation
of
an
indian
litigant
against
a
non-indian
litigant
or
a
non-indian
litigant
against
an
indian
litigant
for
an
off-reservation
occurrence,
all
litigants
in
the
state
of
north
dakota
have
equal
access
to
the
state
courts
of
north
dakota.
they
all
have
the
same
rights,
remedies
and
procedures.
in
the
situation
of
an
indian
litigant
against
a
non-indian
litigant
or
a
non-indian
litigant
against
an
indian
litigant,
the
facts
that
we
have
in
this
case,
the
state
court
of
north
dakota
would
impose
the
same
jurisdictional
restraints
and
requirements
on
all
litigants
and
would
deny
access
in
those
cases
to
all
litigants.
again,
the
same
rights,
procedures
and
privileges
would
be
available
to
all
under
north
dakota
law.
so,
as
it
now
stands,
the
north
dakota
jurisdictional
plan
guarantees
for
everyone
equal
justice
under
the
law.
mr.
gary
h.
lee
in
that
situation,
your
honor,
i
believe
both
litigants
would
be
allowed
to
sue.
in
that
situation,
you
would
have
an
off-reservation
occurrence.
the
indian
litigant--
mr.
gary
h.
lee
--the
car
was
sold
on
the
reservation?
mr.
gary
h.
lee
to
a
reservation
indian?
mr.
gary
h.
lee
in
that
situation,
your
honor,
yes,
that
is
correct.
there
would
be
no
access
to
the
indian
litigant
against
the
used
car
dealer
in
state
court.
there
would,
however,
be
a
forum
available--
mr.
gary
h.
lee
--well,
i
would
hope
that
somebody
would
recognize
the
problem
and
that
is
a
problem
that
has
been
in
existence
in
the
state
of
north
dakota
for
well
over
20
years
and
everyone
has
known
that
that
problem
has
existed,
yet,
in
that
period
of
time,
not
one
effort
has
been
made
to
resolve
the
problem
except
this
case
here
today.
what
three
tribes
here
seeks
today
plain
and
simple
is
unequal
access
to
the
courts
of
north
dakota.
they
wish
to
be
able
to
use
the
courts
as
plaintiffs
without
ever
having
to
run
the
risk
of
appearing
in
those
same
courts
as
a
defendant
and
that
is
an
unequal
access.
furthermore,
the
access
that
they
seek,
at
least
in
the
state
court
in
the
arguments
before
the
north
dakota
supreme
court
was
an
access
which
would
allow
them
all
procedural
protections
and
all
procedural
rights
and
remedies
and
the
non-indian
litigant
would
have
none
of
those
same
protections
and
same
privileges
accorded
to
him.
this
is
the
first
time
today
that
mr.
cross
or
the
attorney
arguing
for
the
indian
litigant
has
admitted
the
possibility
that
north
dakota
rules
of
court
procedure
might
be
applicable
on
the
reservation.
in
the
state
court
below,
that
position...
a
contrary
position
was
taken
and
that
being
that
north
dakota
rules
of
court
procedure
would
not
apply
against
the
indian
litigant.
the
north
dakota
decision
does
not
deny
equal
protection.
equal
protection
is
violated
when
one
group
has
a
distinct
advantage
over
another
group
and
that
is
not
the
situation
that
is
present
here.
everyone,
again,
given
the
same
facts
and
the
same
situation,
has
the
same
access.
again,
what
three
tribes
seeks
is
unequal
status
and
unequal
protection.
mr.
gary
h.
lee
or
the
same
non-access,
that
is
correct.
mr.
gary
h.
lee
no,
i
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
h.
lee
federal
policy
has
long
recognized
access
by
indian
courts
to
state
courts,
but
it
has
never
been
required
of
a
state
court
to
take
that
jurisdiction.
and--
mr.
gary
h.
lee
--that
is
not
correct.
i
believe
that
there
is
a
forum
available
in
this
case.
mr.
gary
h.
lee
it
would
be
either
a
state
court,
if
the
indian
people
chose
to
follow
the
rules
laid
out
in
chapter
27-19
and
agreed
to
have
their
case
brought.
an
order
of
the
district
court
which
dismissed
this
case
left
the
action
open.
the
indians
are
free
to
reinstitute
their
action
at
any
time
following
compliance
with
the
rules
of
the
north
dakota
court
set
down
in
27-19.
mr.
gary
h.
lee
there
may
be
a
statute
of
limitations
question,
however,
given
the
nature
of
the
litigation
here
today,
and
the
fact
that
this
has
been
going
through
the
procedure,
those
limitations,
statute
of
limitation
problems
may
be
tolled.
mr.
gary
h.
lee
it
would
be
speculation
for
me
to
try
and
guess
either
way,
sir.
mr.
gary
h.
lee
yes,
your
honor,
tribal
court.
indian
people
as
a
sovereign
nation
have
the
power,
i
believe,
to
provide
a
forum
for
the
protection
of
their
own
people
and
they--
mr.
gary
h.
lee
--if
the
people
of
the
state
of
north
dakota
are
going
to
refuse
to
entertain
this
type
of
case--
mr.
gary
h.
lee
--that
is
the
rule
right
now,
but
i
would
submit
that
that
rule
is
incorrect.
mr.
gary
h.
lee
that
rule
is
incorrect,
sir,
and
i
would
say
that
if
the
courts
of
north
dakota
are
not
going
to
recognize
jurisdiction
on
the
reservation
and
there
is
a
forum
which
is
set
up
to
fill
that
void,
that
the
decisions
that
come
from
the
forum
that
has
been
created
to
fill
that
void,
would
have
to
be
recognized
off
the
reservation.
mr.
gary
h.
lee
yes,
i
would
submit
that
they
would
be.
mr.
gary
h.
lee
perhaps
not
at
the
time
this
action
arose,
but
at
the
current
time
i
would...
if
they
have
taken
affirmative
steps
to
create
a
forum
to
fill
the
void
and
they
provide
reasonable
rules
of
procedure
which
guarantee
that
reasonable
fairness
and
equity
is
available
to
all
litigants
coming
into
a
tribal
forum,
i
would
submit
that
those
processes
and
services
off
the
reservation
would
have
to
be
honored
by
wold
engineering
and
any
other
non-indian
litigant.
mr.
gary
h.
lee
the
forum
is--
mr.
gary
h.
lee
--the
forum...
i
will
plead
ignorance
on
this.
i
don't
know
what
the
current
status
of
the
indian
forum
is.
what
i
am
submitting
is
that
the
indian
people,
as
a
sovereign,
do
have
the
power
to
protect
themselves
and
to
create
a
forum
and
if
the--
mr.
gary
h.
lee
--to
enforce
on
the
reservation.
mr.
gary
h.
lee
off
the
reservation.
if
the
people
of
the
state
of
north
dakota--
mr.
gary
h.
lee
--the
state
of
north
dakota,
if
it
is
going
to
refuse
to
entertain
this
type
of
jurisdiction
in
its
own
courts
must
recognize
that
the
jurisdictional
void
has
to
be
filled
somehow.
mr.
gary
h.
lee
not
at
this
point.
mr.
gary
h.
lee
not
that
i
am
aware
of.
mr.
gary
h.
lee
at
the
present
time,
i
don't
believe
that
there
is
a
mechanism
for
collecting
it.
the
north
dakota
supreme
court
in
its
decision
stated
that
if
the
indian
people
were
to
somehow
consent
to
state
court
jurisdiction,
that
to
the
extent
that
it
is
allowed
under
federal
or
state
policy,
the
north
dakota
court
would
have
to...
the
north
dakota
decision
could
be
enforced
on
the
reservation.
that
mechanism
has
not
yet
been
fully
explored.
at
the
current
time,
i
don't
believe
that
there
is
a
mechanism
for
enforcing
a
judgment
received
against
the
indian
tribe
outside
of
perhaps
their
own
courts
recognizing
under
some
principle
of
comity
the
decision
of
the
north
dakota
court.
and,
i
am
saying
that
the
concomitant
relationship
would
have
to
exist
between
the
state
courts
and
the
people
on
the
indian
reservation.
if
the
state
court
of
north
dakota
is
going
to
refuse
to
entertain
jurisdiction
on
the
reservation,
and
principles
of
comity
would
require
it
to
recognize
those
decisions
which
come
from
the
reservation
and
give
them
force
and
effect
off
the
reservation.
the
jurisdictional
void
has
to
be
filled
somehow.
mr.
cross
is
here
today
arguing
that
the
north
dakota
decision
denied
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
even
if
the
court
is
to
somehow
believe
that
a
classification
is
here
being
made,
i
would
submit
that
the
north
dakota
jurisdictional
plan
could
still
survive.
the
goal
of
equal
protection
is
to
end
a
caste-based
society
where
classification
based
upon
race
or
other
immutable
characteristics
are
perpetrated
and
continued.
it
also
involves,
i
believe,
a
bit
of
overreaching,
a
substantial
amount
of
overreaching,
by
the
group
with
the
political
power
to
control
and
to
keep
in
a
subservient
position
that
group
without
political
power.
when
those
facts
jell
and
the
pot
is
churned,
then
you
have
a
situation
where
overreaching
occurs
and
equal
protection
is
denied
to
certain
people.
the
north
dakota
law
does
not
create
a
caste-based
society.
as
it
currently
stands,
everyone
is
treated
the
same,
everyone
similarly
situated.
three
tribes'
position
in
this
case
will,
however,
create
a
caste-based
society.
it
will
have
a
situation
where
indian
litigants
will
be
allowed
to
use
the
state
forum
in
north
dakota
without
ever
having
to
appear
as
defendants.
they
will
also
have
all
rules
of
procedure
available
to
them,
while
the
non-indian
litigant
will
have
none.
this
is
a
caste-based
society
and
this
would
be
greatly
unfair
and
would
violate
the
due
process
of
the
laws.
secondly,
the
north
dakota
jurisdictional
plan
draws
no
distinction
based
upon
race
or
other
immutable
characteristics.
the
disability
of
the
indian
litigant
in
this
case
comes
from
his
tribal
status
and
being
located
on
the
reservation
and
those
are
political
concerns
and
political
considerations,
not
necessarily
racial.
furthermore,
if
they
are
racial,
they
are
not
immutable,
because
they
can
be
removed.
the
classic
equal
protection
case
is
a
situation
where
no
matter
what
one
does
to
try
and
better
himself,
to
try
to
improve
himself,
to
try
to
change
his
position,
he
cannot
do
it,
because
the
legislation
refuses
to
allow
him
that
chance.
the
north
dakota
law
gives
the
indian
people
a
chance
to
remove
the
impediment
to
the
state
court
in
this
case
and
all
they
have
to
do
to
receive
that
protection
is
simply
agree
to
follow
and
obey
the
reasonable
rules
of
court
set
out
in
north
dakota
and
to
obey
and
agree
to
follow
the
reasonable
rules
of
substantive
law
which
have
been
laid
out
in
the
state
of
north
dakota.
so,
there
is
no
immutable
characteristic
which
cannot
be
removed.
if
that
is
the
case,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
proper
standard
for
review
on
this
case
would
be
the
rational
basis
standard
and
if
you
apply
the
rational
basis
test
to
this
case,
you
can
see
that
the
north
dakota
supreme
court
enacted
its
legislation
pursuant
to
authority
granted
by
congress
in
public
law
280.
further,
the
people
of
the
state
of
north
dakota,
at
the
time
they
enacted
the
indian
civil
rights
act
in...
the
indian
civil
jurisdiction
act
in
1963
could
have
unilaterally
imposed
all
jurisdiction
on
the
indian
people
without
listening
to
them,
without
paying
them
any
attention
whatsoever.
instead
of
doing
that,
they
held
legislative
hearings
around
the
state
and
the
indian
people
came
to
those
legislative
hearings
and
told
the
state
of
north
dakota
stay
out,
we
want
all
or
nothing
at
all
jurisdiction
until
we
ask
for
it.
and,
that,
i
think,
also
destroys
traditional
equal
protection
problem
here
in
that
we
do
not
have
the
overreaching
by
the
group
with
political
power.
in
fact,
we
have
a
situation
where
the
group
that
had
the
ultimate
political
power
was
leaning
backwards
to
try
and
give
the
indian
people
some
self-determination
and
a
voice
in
their
own
destiny.
a
compact
or
compromise
was
reached,
if
you
will,
between
the
people
of
the
state
of
north
dakota
and
the
indians
residing
on
their
reservations
in
the
state
of
north
dakota.
this
subject-matter
jurisdictional
plan,
this
compact
and
compromise
existing
between
the
indian
people
and
between
the
state
of
north
dakota
is
now
over
20
years
old.
the
indian
people
in
the
state
of
north
dakota
asked
for
this
jurisdictional
plan
and
in
that
period
of
time,
since
this
jurisdictional
plan
was
enacted,
the
north
dakota
supreme
court
has
had
a
number
of
occasions
to
rule
on
the
issues
that
are
before
this
court
today
and
in
1963,
only
about
two
or
three
months
after
the
jurisdictional
plan
went
into
effect,
the
first
case
came
down
and
in
that
first
case
the
north
dakota
supreme
court
held
that
the
north
dakota
courts
would
have
no
subject-matter
jurisdiction
on
the
indian
reservation
in
matters
involving
indian
litigant.
so,
for
20
years
this
jurisdictional
setting
has
been
known
to
the
indian
people.
they
knew
or
should
have
known
that
for
20
years
that
there
would
be
this
problem
that
would
present
itself
some
day,
yet
in
that
20-year
period
of
time,
not
once
did
the
indian
people
come
to
the
north
dakota
legislature
and
try
to
rework
or
renegotiate
a
jurisdictional
plan
that
would
be
workable
and
agreeable
to
everyone.
not
once
in
that
20-year
period
of
time
did
the
indian
people
set
up
an
election
or
try
to
hold
a
tribal
election
to
see
if
they
would
want
to
take
this
jurisdictional
plan
and
not
once
in
that
20-year
period
of
time,
not
until
this
case
apparently,
did
the
indian
people
act
to
create
their
own
forum
which
would,
in
the
future,
be
able
to
control
these
sorts
of
situations.
so,
now,
20
years
after
it
has
been
known
to
them,
they
try
to
come
through
the
backdoor
of
the
courthouse,
while
at
the
same
time
denying
all
other
litigants
access
to
the
front
door
of
the
courthouse.
the
solution
to
this
case
exists
in
the
north
dakota
law
and
it
is
a
political
solution
that
should
be
worked
out
through
political
compromise
between
the
indian
people
and
the
state
of
north
dakota.
that
was
the
situation
that
congress
envisioned
in
public
law
280.
it
is
the
situation
that
congress
envisioned
and
still
exists
by
the
indian
civil
rights
act
of
1968.
the
jurisdictional
plan
that
should
go
into
effect
should
result
not
in
some
forced,
crammed-down
jurisdiction
by
the
indian
people
in
the
state
of
north
dakota,
but
through
a
negotiated
political
process.
if
people
would
get
together
and
act
reasonably
on
a
situation
like
this,
reasonable
results
could
be
obtained;
a
reasonable
plan
for
either
enforcing
the
indian
forum
could
be
reached
or
a
reasonable
plan
for
bringing
about
the
orderly
assumption
of
state
court
jurisdiction
on
the
indian
reservations
could
be
obtained.
there
has
been
no
denial
of
equal
protection
in
this
case
and
should
the
indian
plan...
should
three
tribes
jurisdictional
plan
be
adopted,
in
fact,
we
will
have
unequal
protection
and
it
will
be
the
unequal
protection
of
having
the
class
of
super
plaintiffs
holding
down
the
class
of
hapless
defendants
and
that
will
be
a
situation
which
will
continue
indefinitely.
further,
there
has
been
no
denial
of
due
process,
the
goal
of
due
process,
as
i
understand
it,
is
to
preserve
the
fundamental
rights
guaranteed
to
people
under
the
constitution
and
that
is
a...
one
of
those
rights
is
a
guarantee
of
access
to
a
forum.
there
has
been
a
guaranteed
forum.
as
explained
before,
a
forum
existed.
either
tribally
the
indian
people
had
the
power
to
create
this
forum
and
they
had
it
for
20
years
but
failed
to
act
upon
that
power
and
now
they
seek,
again,
like
i
say,
backdoor
their
way
in--
mr.
gary
h.
lee
--if
the
fears
are
that
the
people
of
the
state
of
north
dakota
are
going
to
ignore
the
wishes
of
the
indian
people,
that
would
be
a
factual
problem
that
would
develop
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
but
the
law,
as
it
is
written,
would
solve
that
problem.
the
law,
as
it
is
currently
written
in
north
dakota,
chapter
27-19,
follows
the
framework
set
out
by
the
language
in
public
law
280
and
it
states
that
the
law
as
between
private
persons
shall
apply.
therefore,
those
matters
which
are
intrinsically
tribal,
which
are
inherently
tribal,
such
as
tribal
elections,
membership
in
the
tribe,
distribution
of
tribal
benefits,
those
will
remain
always
tribal
and
the
state
court
of
north
dakota
can
never
assume
jurisdiction
over--
mr.
gary
h.
lee
--i
believe
inheritance
is
specifically
carved
out,
but
in
those
other
areas
which
could
be
included,
the
north
dakota
law
also
includes
a
provision
which
answers
that
question,
justice
o'connor,
and
it
states
that
the
tribal
customs
and
tribal
traditions
of
the
indian
people
should
first
be
examined
by
the
north
dakota
courts
and
where
possible
that
those
customs
and
traditions
should
be
given
credence,
should
be
given
effect.
i
believe
it
is
specifically
provision
27-19-11
and
in
that
particular
section
the
north
dakota
court
is
directed
to,
if
a
conflict
situation
arises,
resolve
that
conflict
in
the
favor
of
the
indian
people.
and,
so,
if
the
state
law
has
a
domestic
relations
policy
which
would
be
contrary
to
the
policy
of
the
indian
people.
the
state
court
should
first
look
to
the
indian
policy
and
try
to
implement
that
indian
policy
before
it
embarks
upon
the
implementation
of
its
own
state
policy.
so,
that
question
is
also,
at
least
facially
in
the
statute,
answered
by
the
north
dakota
law
as
it
currently
exists.
mr.
gary
h.
lee
there
are
no
indians
that
i
am
aware
of
who
are
members
of
the
state
legislature.
mr.
gary
h.
lee
they
could
negotiate,
sir,
i
believe,
the
same
way
they
negotiated
last
time.
in
1963,
when
the
people--
mr.
gary
h.
lee
--justice
marshall,
in
1963,
the
people
of
the
state
of
north
dakota
had
initially
drafted
a
jurisdictional
plan
which
would
have
crammed
the
state
jurisdiction
down
the
indian
people's
throats.
the
plan
was
for
a
unilateral
state
court
assumption
of
jurisdiction.
the
indian
people
appeared
en
masse
before
the
state
legislature
and
before
various
legislative
committees.
their
tribal
chairman
as
spokesman
got
up--
mr.
gary
h.
lee
--they
had
clout
in
1963.
they
had
enough
clout
in
1963--
mr.
gary
h.
lee
--again,
sir,
i
don't
believe
they
had
any,
but
in--
mr.
gary
h.
lee
--in
north
dakota,
sir?
i
am--
mr.
gary
h.
lee
--mr.
cross,
has
there
ever
been
an
indian
legislator?
mr.
gary
h.
lee
thank
you.
they
had,
sir,
political
clout
in
1963.
they
had
enough
political
clout
in
1963
to
be
able
to
come
in
and
derail
the
north
dakota
jurisdictional
plan.
given
that
situation,
they
have
now
had
20
years
to
again
come,
again
en
masse,
to
ask
the
state
legislature,
let's
try
and
work
something
out
here.
it
is
probably
not
a
one-sided
problem
also.
i
would
say
that
the
people
of
the
state
of
north
dakota
should
have
had
a
duty
to
go
to
the
indian
people
and
say,
look,
we
have
this
jurisdictional
void,
let's
try
and
work
out
some
reasonable
policy
where
we
can
solve
this
dilemma
without
having
to
resort
to
the
judicial
process
again,
again,
and
again.
but,
the
indian
people
did
have
enough
political
clout
in--
mr.
gary
h.
lee
--i
would
submit,
your
honor,
we
have
to
concede
the
issue
of
sovereign
immunity.
the
rulings
that
have
been
handed
down
by
this
court
in
the
united
states
f&g
case
and
in
the
history
of
the
indian
laws
in
the
united
states
and
north
dakota's
obvious
attempts
to
recognize
those
rulings,
that
we
would
have
to
admit
that
they
do
have
sovereign
immunity
from
the
judgment.
but,
i
believe
that
is
a
different
question
from
whether
or
not
they
should
be
at
least
required
to
come
into
the
court
on
the
same
footing
as
everybody
else,
to
play
by
the
same
rules,
to
be
bound
by
the
same
substantive
rights
and
remedies
and
also
to
agree
to
be
bound
by
the
same
rules
of
procedure.
again,
in
the
north
dakota--
mr.
gary
h.
lee
--if--
mr.
gary
h.
lee
--the
people
of
the
state
of
north
dakota
recognize
that
its
own
state
has
sovereign
immunity
to
the
extent
that
it
hasn't
been
waived
and
the
state
of
north
dakota
has
not
waived
its
sovereign
immunity
except
in
contract
actions.
so,
it
is
not
a
foreign
situation
for
the
people
of
the
state
of
north
dakota
to
be
faced
with
a
sovereign
which
asserts
its
sovereign
immunity
and
to
the
extent
that
a
tribe
is
a
sovereign,
we
would
have
to
concede
that
they
do
have
this
immunity
to
pursue.
mr.
gary
h.
lee
the
indian
people
have
to
subject
themselves
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
of
north
dakota
to
the
same
extent
that
those
rules
would
be
applicable
in
actions
involving
private
citizens.
if
you
have
a
sovereign,
a
sovereign
entity
involved,
then
the
rules
are
not
the
same
as
they
are
for
private
persons.
and,
in
that
instance,
the
state
court
of
north
dakota
may
well
be
forced
to
recognize
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
tribe.
and,
i
would
not
submit
that
we
could
rest
or
strip
the
tribe
of
that
sovereign
status.
they
have
the
immunity.
but
that
again
is
not
an
immunity
from
the
reasonable
rules
of
court,
from
process,
from
sanctions,
from
discovery,
and
the
like,
and
that
is
what
was
asserted
below
in
the
north
dakota
supreme
court.
mr.
gary
h.
lee
not
under
these
facts
unless
they
first
agree,
either
individually
or
collectively,
to
consent
to
state
court
jurisdiction.
mr.
gary
h.
lee
the
indian
people
wouldn't
an
individual
sovereign
immunity
and
the
individual
indian
would
be
subject
to
execution
levy
and
the
like.
to
the
extent
that
state
laws
of
private
property
and
persons
apply,
they
would
be
applicable
on
the
reservation
to
the
individual
indian
litigant.
but,
there
is
a
protection
for
the
individual
indian
who
is
dissatisfied
with
that,
because
as
an
individual
he
can
withdraw
his
acceptance
and
reassert
his
tribal
status.
so,
that
problem
is
taken
care
of
in
the
north
dakota
law
as
well.
if
the
individual
indian
becomes
dissatisfied
with
the
north
dakota
jurisdictional
plan
that
he
has
consented
to,
he
can
withdraw
that
consent
and
retreat
back
into
the
protections
afforded
by
tribal
status.
i
am
not
sure
i
answered
the
question
sufficiently.
mr.
gary
h.
lee
yes,
they
can,
sir.
the
north
dakota
jurisdictional
plan
says
that
if
an
individual
indian
consents,
and
i
think
the
tribe
acting
as
a
corporate
entity
might
be
considered
like
a
person
in
that
regard,
if
they
consent,
they
can
withdraw
that
consent
later
on
down
the
road
if
they
become
dissatisfied
with
north
dakota
jurisdictional
plans
and
rules.
mr.
gary
h.
lee
their
sovereign
immunity
from
liability.
mr.
gary
h.
lee
and,
from
execution
judgment
and
the
like.
mr.
gary
h.
lee
no.
mr.
gary
h.
lee
that
is
correct,
but
there
is
the
possibility
to
remove
the
consent
once...
you
know,
if....
mr.
gary
h.
lee
that
is
correct.
the
yardstick
of
any
law
is
not
often
the
yardstick
of
the
common
man,
but
in
this
particular
case,
we
are
dealing
with
something
known
as
a
fundamental
right,
then
the
layman's
perception
is
the
yardstick
to
judge
whether
or
not
something
is
fair
or
fundamentally
unfair.
i
would
submit
that
outside
three
affiliated
tribes,
if
you
were
to
propose
this
particular
jurisdictional
plan
where
one
side
would
have
all
access
to
the
court
for
all
purposes
and
all
procedures
available
for
their
protection
as
plaintiffs,
and
the
defendant
would
have
none
of
the
rights
and
remedies
available
and
none
of
the
procedural
safeguards
available
to
him,
that
there
would
not
be
a
common
man
or
layman
who
would
say
that
that
is
fundamentally
fair.
in
fact,
he
would
say
that
that
is
fundamentally
unfair.
that
is
the
situation
that
the
three
affiliated
tribes
is
seeking
to
impose
in
the
state
court
of
north
dakota.
to
conclude,
i
would
like
to
close
with
a
small
analogy
of
a
baseball
game.
imagine,
if
you
will,
one
team
at
the
plate
where
the
batter
has
an
unlimited
number
of
swings
to
make
contact
with
the
ball,
and,
furthermore,
the
team
at
bat
has
an
unlimited
number
of
outs
to
score
as
many
runs
as
they
want
to
for
as
long
as
they
want
to
keep
scoring,
and
the
team
that
is
in
the
outfield
cannot
even
quit
the
game.
now,
that
is
the
jurisdictional
plan
and
scheme
that
the
indian
people
are
trying
to
impose
on
the
people
of
north
dakota
where
the
people
of
north
dakota
will
be
forever
the
team
that
is
out
in
the
field
shagging
balls.
mr.
gary
h.
lee
thank
you,
sir.
if
it
please
the
court,
i
would
ask
that
the
decision
of
the
north
dakota
supreme
court
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
