justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
cross,
in
this
case,
are
there
any
individual
indians
who
are
plaintiffs
or
is
it
just
the
three
affiliated
tribes?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
these
tribes
themselves
have
refused
to
consent
to
state
court
jurisdiction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
at
any
rate,
it
is
clear
that
if
wold
engineering
had
wanted
to
sue
the
three
affiliated
tribes
in
the
state
court,
it
could
not
have
done
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
cross,
you
used
the
term
"overly
broad".
that
is
something
we
ordinarily
use
in
the
first
amendment
context.
is
there
any
reason
for
this
court
to
go
any
further
here
than
in
the
particular
application
of
the
state
statute
of
the
facts
of
this
case
where
you
are
not
dealing
with
any
individual
indians
who
are
trying
to
sue,
you
are
dealing
with
a
tribe
which
is
trying
to
sue
and
the
tribe
itself
has
withheld
its
consent?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
have
adopted
that
approach
in
the
first
amendment,
that
overbreadth
approach
that
you
say,
that
if
a
state
court
adopts
a
very
broad
construction
of
a
statute,
that
interferes
with
first
amendment
rights,
a
person
who
could
have
gotten
it
under
a
narrow
construction
could
still
challenge
it.
but,
i
don't
believe
we
have
gone
outside
of
the
first
amendment
in
that
area
and
certainly
this
is
just
a
straight
indian
law
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
your
clients
aren't
individual
indians.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
your
case
is
stronger
if
you
can
bring
in
the
rights
of
individual
indians
as
opposed
to
just
the
right
of
your
own
client?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
the
tribe
have
sued
wold
in
federal
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
there
was
a
special
section
of
28
that
said
what
an
indian
tribe
is
is
a
plaintiff
that
can
sue.
am
i
wrong
in
that?
