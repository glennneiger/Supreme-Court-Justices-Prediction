justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
have
the
same
objection
if
the
state
conditioned
its
consent
to
use
its
courts
just
to
the
waiver
of
any
objection
to
proceedings
in
connection
with
that
particular
case;
for
example,
a
counterclaim
and
making
the
tribe
subject
to
discovery
orders
and
contempt
sanctions
and
so
forth,
in
connection
with
the
particular
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
you
said
as
a
setoff,
but
not--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--as
a
counterclaim
that
would
result
in
additional
liability.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
about
the
discovery
procedures
and
so
forth?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
could
the
state
adopt
a
statute
just
requiring
consent
by
the
tribe
to
jurisdiction
for
all
purposes
in
connection
with
that
particular
suit?
would
that
be
valid?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
explain
how
the
tribe
and
non-indian
citizens
are
similarly
situated
for
purposes
of
an
equal
protection
analysis?
it
just
seems
to
me
they
are
not
the
same
because
the
tribe
is
not
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
at
all
of
the
state
courts
under
your
view,
not
even
subject
to
the
counterclaim
in
this
case.
so,
how
are
they
similarly
situated
for
purposes
of
equal
protection?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
two
non-indian
parties,
plaintiff
and
defendant,
were
suing
in
the
state
court
of
north
dakota,
the
plaintiff
in
the
case
would
be
subject
to
a
suit
for
a
counterclaim
in
that
suit
by
the
defendant
and
you
have
told
us
this
morning
again
that
in
your
view
the
tribe
would
not
be
subject
to
a
counterclaim--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
as
a
result
they
are
not
similarly
situated
for
purposes
of
equal
protection
analysis
is
how
it
appears
to
me
anyway.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
we
do
have
in
this
case
a
defendant
wanting
to
make
a
counterclaim,
don't
we?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but,
not
to
the
extent
that
would
be
available
if
the
defendant
were
not
an
indian
tribe.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
how
could
they
be
similarly
situated
then?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
cross,
since
the
case
was
here
before,
has
the
tribe
now
altered
its
laws
so
that
a
suit
would
be
possible
in
tribal
court
today
against
wold
engineering?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
lee,
it
is
certainly
understandable,
i
suppose,
why
the
indian
tribes
wouldn't
want
to
submit
themselves
to
jurisdiction
of
state
courts
for
all
purposes,
isn't
it,
because
they
might
well
not
want
to
have
the
state
court
handling
domestic
relation
matters
of
tribal
indians
and
things
of
that
kind?
i
think
it
is
entirely
understandable
that
the
tribe
has
not
opted
to
subject
itself
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
courts
and
state
laws
generally.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
about
matters
of
adoption
or
child
custody
or
marital
dissolution,
inheritance,
things
of
that
kind?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
consent
has
to
be
for
all
purposes
and
can
only
be
removed
after
going
through
certain
time
requirements
and
posting
and
notice
and
so
forth.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
the
consent
has
to
be
given
for
all
purposes
and
it
is
in
effect
for
a
certain
period
of
time
until
statutory
procedures
are
complied
with
to
terminate
it.
