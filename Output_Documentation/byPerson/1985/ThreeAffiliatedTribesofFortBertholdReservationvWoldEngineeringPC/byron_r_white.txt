unless--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and,
the
waiver...
the
condition
is
not
only
for
this
case,
but
for
all
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
in
this
case
the
tribes
comes
into
sue
for
breach
of
contract,
for
failure
to
perform,
and
wold
says
we
didn't
fail
anything,
we
performed
and
now
we
are
counterclaiming
for
the
amount
you
promised
us
for
building
this
structure
or
whatever
it
was.
suppose
the
court
finds
for
wold
that
they
didn't
breach
the
contract
and
that
the
tribe
owes
them
something.
i
take
you
wouldn't
think
the
tribe's
consent
to
the
counterclaim
would
permit
that
judgment
to
be
entered
against
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
your
answer
is,
yes,
that
judgment
should
not
be
entered?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
isn't
any
equitable
setoff.
wold
just
wins
the
case
supposedly.
no
breach.
wold
doesn't
owe
the
tribe
a
thing,
but
the
tribe
owes
wold
something,
but
that
judgment
could
not
be
entered?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
that
is
your
view
of
tribal
immunity.
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
you
would
say
that
even
if
that
is
the
case,
the
state
could
not
dismiss
the
action
in
the
first
place?
you
would
say
the
state
would
not
be
permitted
to
say
to
the
tribe,
now,
look,
if
you
want
to
file
this
complaint
and
have
us
entertain
it,
you
must
waive
your
immunity
with
respect
to
the
counterclaim.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
may
present
a
different
issue,
but
how
would
you
resolve
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
in
your
view,
the
state
could
not
dismiss
the
action
for
failure
to
waive
the
counterclaim?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
it
was
a...
federal
courts
hear
state
law
questions
all
the
time
in
diversity
cases.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
may
not
be,
but
there
is
a
statute
that
says
indians
can
come
into
court.
why
isn't
that...
it
may
be
the
governing
law
would
be
state
law,
but
why
can't
the
indians
come
into
federal
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
free
of
the
problem
of
diversity.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
provision
is
completely
useless
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
didn't
need
that
statute
to
come
into
federal
court
on
a
federal
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
say
then
the
statute
just
wasn't
needed
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
on
a
state
law
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
another
suggestion
for
a
forum?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
wold
subject
to
service
by
a
tribal
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
tribal
court
can
serve
a
summons
state-wide?
