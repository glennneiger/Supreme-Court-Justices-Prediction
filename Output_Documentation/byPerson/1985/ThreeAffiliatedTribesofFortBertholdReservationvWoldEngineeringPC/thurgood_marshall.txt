suppose
a
state
has
a
provision
that
any
non-resident
must
post
a
bond
before
filing
an
action.
would
that
apply
to
your
case
if
they
had
such
a
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
could
do
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
would
have
no
objection.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
lee,
let's
take
a
little
easier
one.
a
used
car
salesman
sells
a
car
to
an
indian
and
to
an
ordinary
citizen
off
the
reservation
and
both
of
them
are
lemons.
the
man
can
sue,
the
indian
can't.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
no,
he
sold
the
car
on
the
reservation.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
wouldn't
somebody
at
least
say
oophs,
sorry,
or
something
like
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
they
enforce
it
outside
of
the
reservation?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
talking
about
what
you
have
now
in
north
dakota.
you
can't
enforce
a
tribal
rule
outside
the
reservation,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
is
what
we
are
talking
about
right
now.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
it
in
existence
today?
it
is
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
is
it
going
to
help
this
case
if
it
is
not
in
existence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
to
enforce?
justice
thurgood
marshall
off
the
reservation.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
can
the
indian
enforce
off
the
reservation,
how?
justice
thurgood
marshall
has
it
done
so?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
thinking
about
doing
so?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
not
forget
it?
mr.
lee,
may
i
ask
the
other
side
of
the
coin?
if
you
client
has...
i
guess
there
is
a
balance
due
on
the
contract
that
is
unpaid.
how
do
you
go
about
collecting
that
money?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
lee,
getting
back
to
your
point
about
the
indian
should
have
been
negotiating
all
along
these
20
years,
how
many
indians
do
you
have
in
the
state
legislature?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
could
they
negotiated.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
negotiate
and
come
up
with
the
same
thing
they
have
got
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
they
had
no
clout.
how
can
you
have
clout
if
you
don't
have
a
vote?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
legislators
did
they
have
in
1963?
justice
thurgood
marshall
have
you
ever
heard
of
one
in
south
dakota
ever?
justice
thurgood
marshall
ever?
have
you
ever
had
an
indian
legislator?
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
an
individual
waive
indian
sovereignty?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
can
an
individual
waive
a
state
sovereignty?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
talking
about
under
your
tribal
government
how
can
an
individual
waive
sovereignty?
