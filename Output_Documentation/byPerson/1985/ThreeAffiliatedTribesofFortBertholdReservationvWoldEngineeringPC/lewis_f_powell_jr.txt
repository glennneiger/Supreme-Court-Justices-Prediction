justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
are
not
suggesting,
are
you,
that
if
this
suit
were
brought
by
individual
indians
rather
than
by
the
tribes
that
the
result
would
be
different
in
your
opinion?
would
individual
indians
have
any
right
to
sue
in
state
court?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well...
i
don't
quite
understand
your
answer,
but
indians
themselves
individually
can't
waive
sovereign
immunity,
only
the
state
can
do
that.
