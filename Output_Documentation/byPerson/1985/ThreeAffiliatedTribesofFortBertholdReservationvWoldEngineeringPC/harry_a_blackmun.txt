or
the
same
non-access?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
think
non-access
to
this
tribe
to
the
state
courts
is
a
denial
of
federal
policy?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
why
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes,
but
you
end
up
with
a
situation
where
there
is
no
forum
available
for
the
resolution
of
this
dispute.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
is
the
forum?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
about
the
statute
of
limitations?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
maybe.
will
they
be
tolled?
let's
not
