justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question,
mr.
lee?
you
suggested
a
couple
of
times
that
maybe
they
should
have
set
up
their
own
judicial
system
and
then
they
could
have
brought
this
action
in
their
own
court
and
might
have
solved
the
problem.
but,
what
if
they
set
up
a
judicial
system
without
abandoning
their
claim
of
sovereign
immunity?
would
the
case
be
any
different?
say
they
got
a
judgment
and
so
forth
and
they
wanted
to
enforce
it
in
state
court
and
said,
no,
we
won't
unless
you
consent
to
a
counterclaim.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
can
it
be
the
same
if
they
have
sovereign
immunity?
i
am
a
little
puzzled.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
not
the
same
rules
except
they
can't
lose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
the
condition
that
your
legislation
imposes,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
they
must
waive
their
sovereign
immunity.
don't
they
have
to
consent
to
be
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
state
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
neither
am
i.
[laughter]
can
the
tribe
itself
do
that,
give
a
consent
for
the
purpose
of
a
short
period
of
time
and
then
withdraw
the
consent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
your
submission...
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
you...
that
they
could
give
that
kind
of
consent
for
the
purpose
of
a
short
period
of
time
and
retain
their
sovereign
immunity?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
from
execution?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
they
have
a
pretty
simple
solution
then.
they
could
just
consent
for
this
case,
have
it
litigated,
and
even
if
they
lose
they
don't
have
to
pay.
i
don't
know
why
they
don't
do
that.
well,
now,
the
consent
provisions
of
the
statute
don't
authorize
consent
just
for
one
case.
