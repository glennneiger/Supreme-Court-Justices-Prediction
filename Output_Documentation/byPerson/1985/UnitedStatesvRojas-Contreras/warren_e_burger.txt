i

you
are

very
well.
ms.

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
on
that
score,
it's
true,
it's
not
malum
in
se,
but
here's
a
man
who's
repeating
precisely
the
act
that
he
had
previously
performed.

e.
burger
making
two
illegal
entries.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it's
not
an
issue,
i
quote
agree,
but
i
was
merely
having
an
observation
on
your
point
that
he
really
hadn't
done
anything
very
seriously
wrong.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he's
had
repeated,
repeated
performances.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
haven't
some
of
the
other
circuits
already
done
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
am
i
correct
in
my
understanding
that
the
ninth
circuit
decided
this
case
without
oral
argument?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mrs.
stemler?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
