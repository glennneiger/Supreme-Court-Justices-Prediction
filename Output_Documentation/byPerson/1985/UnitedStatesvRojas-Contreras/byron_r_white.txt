what
do
you
call
a
superseding
indictment?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would...
i
gather
from
what
you
have
said
that
there
would
be
some
superseding
indictments
where
a
discretionary
continuance
certainly
should
be
granted.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
just
say
the
act
just
doesn't
make
it
mandatory
except
once,
just
once.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
long
as
the
superseding
indictment
relates
to
the
same
transaction,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
the
superseding
indictment
charges
a
violation
of
an
additional
statute?
