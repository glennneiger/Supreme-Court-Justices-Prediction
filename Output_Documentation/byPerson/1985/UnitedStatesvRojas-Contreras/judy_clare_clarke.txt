ms.
judy
clare
clarke
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
by
the
use
of
the
word
"superseding"
in
front
of
the
term
"indictment",
the
government
in
reality
is
asking
this
court
to
allow
the
government
to
have
control
over
the
defense
preparation
period.
that's
not
what
congress
did.
prior
to
the
mandatory
defense
preparation
period
being
inserted
into
the
speedy
trial
act,
congress
became
convinced
that
the
courts
were
not
capable
because
of
the
pressures
of
the
speedy
trial
act
of
exercising
the
necessary
discretion
to
adequately
protect
the
rights
of
the
defendant
to
be
prepared,
and
that's
why
we
cannot
turn
the
mandatory
defense
preparation
period
into
a
discretionary
period.
it's
mandatory,
it
must
be
read
as
mandatory,
and
the
fact
that
the
government
places
an
adjective
in
front
of
the
term
"indictment"
cannot
change
the
meaning
of
the
word
"indictment".
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
that
is
correct,
justice
rehnquist,
and
the
definition
then
that
this
court
must
look
to
is
what
does
the
term
"first
appears
through
counsel"
mean,
and
we
have
to
look
at
the
history
and
how
that
language
got
into
the
statute.
the
department
of
justice
and
the
judicial
conference
of
the
united
states
submitted
to
the
congress
language
for
the
defense
preparation
period
that
read
something
similar
to
this:
unless
the
defendant
consents
in
writing
to
the
contrary,
trial
shall
not
commence
less
than
30
days
from
the
date
specified
in
paragraph
<one>
[=
1].
now,
paragraph
1
referred
to
the
70
day
activation
provision.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
that's
right.
but
then
what
congress
did
to
that,
it
was,
congress
said
the
defendant
really
is
not
in
a
position
to
adequately
take
advantage
of
the
mandatory
defense
preparation
period
until
counsel
comes
onto
the
scene,
and
that's
when
they
liberalized,
they
did
not
restrict,
they
liberalized
the
mandatory
defense
preparation
period
to
say
that
it
begins
from
the
first
appearance
through
counsel.
and
the
only
cornerstone
that
you
can
hook
that
first
appearance
into
is
an
indictment.
otherwise,
you
are
building
in
discretion
into
the
act.
the
act
would
then
become
confusing
as
to
the
application
of
the
30
day
period,
would
begin
to
litigate,
it
fosters
litigation
over
what's
material,
what's
typographical,
what's
a
change
in
the
indictment--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--but
congress
did
hook
it
in
to
the
filing
of
the
indictment,
and
congress
went
a
step
further.
they
just
didn't
want
to
limit
the
defendant
to
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
indictment.
they
wanted
to
give
the
defendant
that
opportunity
for
counsel
to
enter
the
scene
on
that
indictment.
now,
the
government
argues,
and
it
is
implicit
in
your
question,
that
congress
could
have
said
first
appearance
post-superseding
indictment.
that
would
fly
in
the
face
of
the
history
of
the
entire
federal
criminal
code
because
superseding
indictment
is
just
not
used.
congress
did
not
restrict
the
defendant's
rights,
congress
liberalized
the
defendant's
rights
by
placing
the
words
"first
appearance
through
counsel".
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
it
could
be
at
an
arraignment.
it
could
be...
it
couldn't
be
at
the
time
the
indictment
is
filed,
but
it
could
be
at
the
defendant's
arraignment
on
the
indictment.
the
evidence
before
congress
at
the
time--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--i
would
disagree
with
the
justice--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--what
happens
at
an
arraignment?
the
indictment.
the
defendant
is
arraigned
on
the
indictment.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
no,
no.
the
arraignment
would
take
place
after
the
indictment
was
filed.
to
consider
the
significance
of
a
superseding
indictment,
consider,
the
court
must
consider
what
happens
when
a
superseding
indictment
is
filed,
and
that
goes
again
to
your
question,
justice
rehnquist.
an
indictment
is
returned
by
the
grand
jury,
signed
by
the
foreman,
filed
in
the
district
court.
the
defendant
appears
on
the
indictment,
is
arraigned
on
the
indictment,
given
a
copy
of
the
indictment
notice
of
the
specific
charge,
and
called
upon
to
plead.
now,
what
happens
when
a
superseding
indictment
is
filed
is
the
exact
same
thing.
the
grand
jury
foreman
signs
the
indictment,
it
is
filed
in
the
district
court,
the
defendant
is
arraigned
on
the
indictment,
he
is
given
notice
and
a
copy
of
the
indictment
and
called
upon
to
plead.
so
the
exact
same
processes,
the
significance
to
the
defendant
is
that
he
is
being
given
notice
of
what
the
charge
is,
the
charge
that
is
the
only
significant
charge
to
him
at
all,
and
that
is
the
charge
upon
which
he
is
going
to
go
to
trial.
otherwise
the
indictment
process,
the
formality--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--as
is
similar
in
this
case,
justice
marshall.
the
indictment
was--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--the
superseding...
i'm
sorry.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
well,
then
we
go
back--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--then
the
problem
becomes
the
super...
the
defense
preparation
period
becomes
discretionary
at
the
hands
of
the
government.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
well,
the
problem
is
this
court
is
interpreting
(c)(2).
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
well,
i
would
be
speculating,
but
i
will
be
happy
to
answer
your
question.
for
example,
in
mr.
rojas'
case,
when
the
date
was
changed
to
the
proper
date,
mr.
rojas
lost
the
defense,
a
defense
to
the
charge,
completely
obliterated
any
plausible
attempt
at
asking
for
a
lesser
included
offense
verdict
in
the
case.
mr.
rojas
was
charged
with
a
felony
illegal
entry
which
requires
as
a
predicate
to
that
felony
that
the
date
be
proven
of
his
prior
conviction.
if
the
government
didn't
prove
that,
and
the
jury
believed
the
argument
that
the
government
did
not
prove
their
case
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
because
the
date
was
wrong,
which
the
jury
would
be
in
their
power
to
do,
then
mr.
rojas
would
have
been
convicted
of
a
misdemeanor.
but
the
more--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--i'm
sorry,
sir.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
to
decide
whether
or
not--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--that's
precisely
why
congress
enacted
the
mandatory
defense
preparation
period,
because
the
judges,
because
of
the
pressures
of
the
outer
time
limits
of
the
act--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--that's
right.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
that's
right.
i
couldn't
have
said
it
better,
and
that's
exactly--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--that's
exactly
what
congress
did
because
what
happened
when
the
speedy
trial
act
came
in
in
1975
is
it
created
in
extreme
artificial
pressure
on
the
trial
courts
of
this
nation
to
try
cases
fast.
they
said
to
the
trial
courts
we
know
you
don't
want
it,
but
here's
the
speedy
trial
act,
and
you've
got
to
try
this
case
within
60
or
70
days,
whatever
the
time
period
was
at
that
time.
and
the
courts
were
saying,
yeah,
we
know
we've
got
to
try
it,
so
we're
going
to
try
it
now
because
we've
got
a
day
open,
and
we've
got
time
to
try
you,
and
we're
going
to
make
you
go
now.
and
then
when
the
department
of
justice
and
the
judicial
conference
went
back
to
the
congress
and
said
haste
is
equally
as
bad
as
delay,
the
congress
gave
to
the
defendant
a
mandatory
defense
preparation
period.
the
problem
with
reading
the
(c)(2)
provision,
the
defense
preparation
period,
as
other
than
mandatory
when
the
government
chooses
to
file
a
superseding
indictment
is
that
it
creates
a
great
deal
of
uncertainty
in
the
system,
will
be
fostering
a
great
deal
of
litigation
over
what's
material,
is
there
really
a
need
for
this
defense
preparation
period.
you'll
have
the
criminal
defendant
back
in
the
position
of
having
to
say
to
the
trial
judge
i
really
need
this
period
of
preparation,
and
again
you
have
the
outer
time
limits
crushing
down
on
the
trial
judge,
and
the
trial
judge
is
going
to
say,
criminal
defendant,
congress
told
me
to
try
this
case
within
70
days.
i've
got
time
for
you
now.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
that
would
extend
the
time
under
the
excludable--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--a
need
is
a
tad
bit
different
than
requiring
the
court
because
what
is
going
to
weigh
most
heavily
in
the
court's
mind?
what's
going
to
weigh
most
heavily--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--mr.
rojas
didn't
get
it.
mr.
guzman
in
the
second
circuit,
united
states
v.
guzman,
didn't
get
it.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
well,
guzman's
15
year
drug
conviction
was
reversed
by
the
second
circuit
because
of
the
failure
of
the
trial
court
to
grant
the
miniscule
continuance
that
was
requested.
if
the
court
employs
a
simple
certain
final
rule,
what
will
happen
is
that
we
won't
have
the
litigation
we
did
in
guzman,
we
won't
have
the
litigation
we
did
in
gallo,
in
the
sixth
circuit,
united
states
v.
gallo
where
the
sixth
circuit
said
you
didn't
have
time
to
prepare
for
that
rico
count,
we're
going
to
reverse
that
conviction,
and
that
is
the
kind
of
litigation
that
i
think
that
the
courts
of
this
nation
are
going
to
see.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
i
disagree,
and
i
disagree
with
the
basic
premise
that
the
question
is
founded
upon.
first,
a
superseding
indictment
is
not...
does
not
neatly
fit
within
the
provision
that
you
referred
to
earlier
and
that
you
referred
to
now,
the
(h)(6)
provision
where
the
government
dismisses
and
refiles
and
the
time
limit
is
then
connected
to
the
original
indictment
and
not
the
refiled
indictment.
the
superseding
indictment
traditionally,
as
i
understand
them,
although
they
are
not
defined
in
the
code,
comes
in,
the
original
indictment
exists
and
the
superseding
indictment
comes
in,
and
in
fact,
in
mr.
rojas'
case,
it
wasn't
forgetting.
the
government
did
not
move
to
dismiss
the
first
indictment
until
the
time
of
sentencing
of
mr.
rojas.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
well,
one,
it
makes
a
great
deal
of
difference
because
the
statute
is
very,
very
specific,
and
the
statute
does
not
talk
about
indictments
that
overlap.
the
statute
talks
about
the
government
dismissing
and
refiling.
the
purpose
behind
(h)(6),
that
provision
that
regulates
government
conduct--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--no,
because--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--had
the
government
dismissed,
mr.
rojas
would
have
been
freed
from
bondage.
now,
let's
say
that
of
course...
from
custody
because
there
would
have
been
no
charge
pending,
and
i
think
that's
what
(h)(6)
goes
to.
but
let's
say
that
the
government
had
dismissed
one
instant
before
the
superseding
indictment,
and
i
can
address
your
question.
(h)(6)
was
put
into
the
act
to
restrict
the
government,
not
the
defendant.
(h)(6)
was
put
into
the
act
to
prevent
the
government
from
filing,
going
to
day
69,
dismissing
and
filing
and
then
forever
extending
the
speedy
trial
act.
(h)(6)
was
not
put
into
the
act
to
hurt
the
defendant.
(h)(6)
was
not
put
in
there
as
a
burden
to
the
defendant.
the
government
when
they
dismiss
and
they
refile
outside
of
<thirty>
[=
30]
days--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--well,
the
record
reflects
that
the
prosecutor
said
that
there's
a
typographical
error.
the
record
does
not
reflect
in
fact
it
was
a
typographical
error,
and
we
should
assume
that
grand
juries
sign
indictments
that
they
mean,
and
they
sign
indictments
based
on
the
evidence
that
they
hear.
so
i'm
not
sure
that
i'm
necessarily
willing
to
concede
that
it's
a
typographical
error.
but
justice
o'connor,
you
do
bring
up
the
critical
statutory
construction
problem
with
the
issue
that's
before
the
court.
but
because
the
purpose
of
(h)(6)
was
to
restrict
the
government
and
not
to
hurt
the
defendant,
it's
very
consistent
to
read
into
(h)(6)
that
any
time
the
government
would
be
in
the
position
of
violating
the
70
days
by
its
late
filing
of
a
superseding
indictment,
that
(c)(2),
the
defense
preparation
period,
acts
as
its
own
continuance
provision,
its
own
exclusion,
and
activates
the
ends
of
justice,
or
there's
nothing
wrong
with
saying
to
the
government
you
are
the
party
that
delayed
in
filing
the
superseding
indictment.
you
are
the
party
that
should
have
known
what
your
indictment
should
say.
you
are
the
party
that's
made
this
deliberate
choice.
place
the
burden
on
the
government
to
obtain
the
ends
of
justice
exclusion
provision
because
t
think
that
when
the
government
files
outside
of
the
first
30
day
period,
they
are
going
to
run
into
some
trouble
with
3161(b)
which
requires
that
any
indictment
filed
in
a
criminal
case
must
be
filed
within
30
days
of
the
arrest
of
the
defendant.
so
if
the
government
files
outside
of
the
30
day
period,
i
think
they're
going
to
be
running
into
a
violation
of
the
(b)
provision,
and
they're
going
to
have
to
justify
to
the
court
the
late
filing
of
that
superseding
indictment
anyway.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
well,
that's
questionable.
i
think
that
the
government...
and
the
position
they
took
before
the
district
court
is
that
they
could
have
requested
an
amendment
or
the
striking
of
the
surplusage,
and
that
the
district
court
could
have
done
that.
had
they
done
that,
i
do
not
think
that
the
defendant
would
be
entitled
to
a
second
(c)(2)
provision.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
we
wouldn't
be
here
on
(c)(2).
we
might
be
here
on
(h)(8)(b)(iv),
but
we
would
not
be
here
on
(c)(2).
the
basic
response
to
that
is
that
(c)(2),
the
mandatory
defense
preparation
period,
just
is
not
the
answer
to
all
of
the
ails
of
the
criminal
defendant,
and
that's
precisely
why
congress
injected
the
discretionary
continuance
provision.
congress
gave
us
two,
two
preparation
periods.
one
they
said
is
mandatory,
and
one
they
said
is
discretionary.
and
the
mandatory
one
they
had
to
give
to
the
courts
to
relieve
the
pressures
of
those
outer
time
limits
and
to
inject
balance
into
the
system.
to
hold
otherwise
makes
that
(c)(2)
period
discretionary
solely
at
the
hands
of
the
government,
solely
based
on
when
the
government
decides
to
file
superseding
indictment.
the
real
problem
that
we
face
is
that
there's
a
great
inertia
running.
the
speedy
trial
act
compels
the
trial
courts
to
set
a
trial
date
early
on,
and
once
that
trial
date
is
set,
that's
sort
of
like
cast
in
stone,
and
as
you
get
closer
to
it
and
the...
because
the
trial
court,
what
they
do
is
they
clear
their
calendar
for
everything
else.
they
are
going
to
try
your
case
that
day.
and
the
government
comes
in
with
their
superseding
indictment
no
matter
how
minute
the
change.
the
defendant's
not
going
to
be
able
to
get
a
continuance
on
the
regular
basis
that
he's
going
to
need
the
continuance.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
well,
that
would
be
up
to
the
defendant
to
decide,
and
of
course,
under
(c)(2)
the
defendant
can
waive
that
30
day
preparation
period,
and
of
course,
in
regard
to
mr.
rojas,
he
had
to
make
a
difficult
decision
whether
to
assert
it
or
not
because
he's
sitting
in
custody,
and
certainly
he's
making
the
decision
that
hurts
only,
only
himself.
the
need
for
the--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--well,
who
made
that
decision
though?
could
the
government
not
have
brought
their
superseding
indictment
in
a
timely
fashion?
in
san
diego,
in
the
southern
district
of
california,
the
grand
jury
meets
on
wednesdays
and
fridays,
regularly.
the
indictment
could
have
been
filed.
the
government
in
its
reply
to
the
respondent's
brief
said
something
to
the
effect
of
the
grand
juries
don't
meet
regularly
enough,
and
you
have
to
schedule
your
superseding
indictments
with
the
workload
of
the
grand
jury.
well,
in
guzman,
they
superseded
the
indictment
between
mistrials,
and
in
hawkins,
a
case
that
is
now
pending
cert
before
this
court,
they
superseded
between
changes
of
venue.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
that
varies
from
district
to
district,
and--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--right,
and
that's
about
like
it
is
in
san
diego.
but
the
government
knows
that,
and
they
can
seek
a
continuance
to
file
a
proper
indictment.
if
the
court
allows
the
government
behavior
to
be
condoned,
really--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--i
would
think
that
that
would--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--i
think
that
would
cause
a
great
deal
of
problems
under
the
fifth
amendment,
to
change
an
indictment
during
trial.
of
course,
this
court
in
the
united
states
v.
miller
said
you
can
prove
less
than
you
allege,
but
that
is
certainly
different
than
conforming
the
indictment
or
changing
the
indictment--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--a
superseding
indictment--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--any
change
at
all.
a
superseding
indictment
is
an
indictment,
and
it
has
to
be
the
cornerstone,
it
has
to
be
the
only
logical
touchstone
for
the
30
day
period
to
run
from.
otherwise
there's
litigation,
there's
confusion,
there's
discretion
injected
back
into
the
act.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
i'm
sorry,
justice
marshall.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
right.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
there's
no--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--there's
no
requirement
under
the
defense
preparation
period
that
the
defendant
show
anything--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--congress,
congress
simply
did
not
require
such.
congress
created
a
real
rigid
statutory--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--i
don't
think
so
because
i
think
this
court
is
stuck
with
interpreting
the
legislation
before
it--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--well,
maybe
that's
not
the
right
word,
but
in
a
sense,
that's
where
we
are
because
this
court
really
needs
to
interpret
what
congress
said
and
not
create
the
legislation.
this
court
refused
in
barker
v.
wingo
to
say
anything
about
rigid
time
limits
under
the
sixth
amendment
in
the
speedy
trial
clause,
and
congress
took
the
bait
that
was
left
open
from
that
decision
and
said
we're
going
to
give
the
courts
a
speedy
trial
act,
and
they
did,
and
i
think
whether
the
courts
like
it,
whether
the
government
likes
it,
whether
the
defendants
like
it,
we
have
it,
and
we
ought
to
construe
it
in
a
manner
that's
easy
to
apply.
we
ought
to
construe
it
in
a
manner
that
does
not
create
litigation--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--the
date
that
the
defendant
appears
on
the
superseding
indictment.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
in
all
practical--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--appears
through
counsel
on
the
superseding
indictment.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
well,
it
doesn't
say
indictment
either,
but
if
you
look
to
the
history
of
the
language
"first
appears
through
counsel",
what
congress
did
was
they
liberalized
the
language
which
connected
this
defense
preparation
period
to
the
indictment
by
saying
we're
not
going
to
just
tie
it
to
the
indictment,
we're
going
to
tie
it
to
when
counsel
appears
on
the
indictment
because
then
a
defendant
is
in
a
position
to
more
fully
protect
his
basic
due
process
rights.
l--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--that's
right,
and
he
knows
the
charge.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
well,
what
good
is
the
lawyer
in
the
vacuum
of
not
knowing
the
precise
charge?
the
indictment
tells
the
lawyer--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--that's
right,
and
that's
the
only
simple
way
to
read
the
rule
because
you're
not
always
going
to
have--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--because
i
think
congress
didn't
want
to--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--no,
it
says
from
the
filing
of
the
indictment
or
the
appearance
of
the
defendant
on
the
indictment.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
it
doesn't
refer
to
the
appearance
of
counsel.
so
(c)(1)
can
activate
before
counsel
even
comes
into
the
scene.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
and
that's
why
they
didn't
want
(c)(2)
to
activate
precisely
at
the
time
that
(c)(1),
the
70
day
period,
activated.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
the
latter
of
the
two
dates,
but
(c)(1)
in
no
way--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--connects
itself
to
the
appearance
of
counsel.
it
connects
itself
to
the
appearance,
the
arraignment
of
the
defendant
on
the
indictment,
which
can
happen
in
the
absence
of
the--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--has
appeared
before
a
judicial...
well,
that's
for
the
arraignment.
that
would
not
be
the...
that
couldn't
be
construed,
i
don't
think,
to
be
the
preliminary
hearing
which
i
am
sure
this
court
knows
we
very
rarely
have
in
the
federal
criminal
system
anyway
because
of
the
return
of
the
indictment
moots
that
issue
out.
but
i
think
(c)(1)
refers
to
the
appearance
of
the
defendant
on
the
indictment
or
the
filing
date
of
the
indictment,
whichever
occurs
later.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
because
of
the
magistrates.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
yes,
the
magistrates
who
take
arraignments,
and
i
think
they're
referred
to
throughout
the
code
as
judicial
officers
and
not
judges
of
the
court.
the
second
basic
issue
that
the
government
raised
in
its
brief
and
to
which
we
respond
is
that
of
harmless
error,
and
in
reality,
the
harmless
error
argument
is
again
the
same
argument,
just
couched
in
different
terms,
because
if
the
harmless
error
concept
applies
to
a
mandatory
time
limit
such
as
the
30
day
time
limit,
then
the
time
limit
is
gone,
in
reality.
and
congress
gave
a
rigid
statutory
scheme,
they
created
the
30
day
defense
preparation
period
because
of
the
demands
placed
on
the
courts.
we
can't
determine
the
harm
that
would
arise
from
the
failure
to
comply
with
the
act.
this
court
earlier,
in
an
argument
previous
to
this
argument,
was
concerned
about
what
nonconstitutional
error
has
not
had
the
harmless
error
standard
applied
to
it,
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
statute
of
limitations
provision
is
a
nonconstitutionally
based
statute
that
does
not
provide
for
its
own
sanction,
that
does
not
provide
for
any
analysis,
whether
it
says
whether
it
is
subject
to
harmless
error
or
not,
but
it
just
has
not
been
made
subject
to
the
harmless
error
analysis,
and
in
reality,
defense
preparation
period
is
a
mirror
image
of
that
statute
of
limitations
because
courts
lose
jurisdiction
after
five
years
or
whatever
the
statute
of
limitations
is
in
any
given
case.
and
in
a
sense,
what
congress
said
to
the
courts
is
you
don't
have
the
authority
to
try
a
criminal
defendant
within
30
days.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
first,
prejudice
is
not
the
consideration
that
we
can
apply
to
the
(c)(2)
provision
because,
again,
injecting
prejudice
into
it--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--first,
there
was
no...
there
was
no
showing
of
prejudice
made
by
counsel
below
because
counsel
below
was
relying
on
the
governing
law
of
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
language
of
the
speedy
trial
act.
the
prejudice...
and
i'll
have
to
speculate,
as
i
did
for
justice
marshall...
is
that
the
defendant,
when
the
date
was
changed,
lost
the
defense
to
the
charge,
and
at
that
point
had
no
opportunity
to
go
back
and
re-evaluate
his
position,
had
no
opportunity
to
go
back
and
reopen
plea
negotiations
in
the
case.
the
defendant
had
no
opportunity
to
determine
whether
there
was
some
other
defense
to
the
charge.
and
what...
justice
o'connor
refers
to
it
as
a
windfall
defense
or
a
windfall
victory
for
the
defendant.
illegal
entry,
the
crime
of
illegal
entry
is
a
very
technical
crime,
and
it
is
not
a
malum
in
se,
in
that
sense,
it
is
a
malum
prohibitum,
and
it
has
its
own
specific
elements,
and
as
any
defense
counsel
knows,
you've
got
to
meet
the
elements
as
you
see
them.
it's
not
your
burden
to
tell
the
government
how
to
prove
them,
and
when
the
government
figures
it
out
and
takes
away
your
defense,
you've
got
to
jump
back
into
position
and
begin
to
consider
where
you
are.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
he's
coming
back
into
the
country--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--more
than
two,
more
than
two,
and
i
would
predict,
if
i
could,
before
this
court,
that
he'll
probably
be
back
because
fernando
rojas-contreras
is
a
man
who's
going
to
try
to
come
into
the
united
states
to
work,
and
i
don't
think
that's
really
the
issue
before
the
case,
but
we're
not
talking
about
a
very
serious
crime.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
well,
in--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--in
the
realm
of
the
federal
criminal
cases...
and
i
do
not
mean
to
demean
the
fact
that
congress
has
made
illegal
entry
illegal,
and
i
do
not
mean
to
condone
that
as
it's
okay
because
it's
not
really
that
bad,
but
in
the
realm
of
criminal
cases
it's
not
up
at
the
top
of
the
chart.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
well,
i
think
so,
too,
and
if
congress
would
give
us
a
little
more--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--well,
then,
then...
but
congress
didn't
give
us
any
more,
judge.
what
congress
did
was
it
said
if
you
need
more
than
30
days,
you've
got
to
go
over
this
discretionary
continuance
provision,
and
you've
got
to
act--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--it
did
not
need
to
be
made
below,
it
was
asserted.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
the
30
day
provision
was
asserted
below.
i
think
that
the
argument
was
made
below.
i
would
disagree
with
you,
justice
marshall,
with
all
due
respect.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
no.
the
government
did
not.
what
we
really
ask
this
court
for
is
an
interpretation
of
a
rule
of
congress
that
is
simple,
that
is
certain,
and
provides
finality
to
an
already
chaotic
system.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
there
are
two.
there's
the
seventh
circuit
and
half
of
the
ninth,
i
can
say
at
this
point,
has
followed
this
rigid
interpretation
that
i
urge
upon
this
court.
the
other
half
of
the
ninth,
and
the
sixth
and
the
eleventh
have
not.
they
have
found
that
the
provision
is
discretionary,
and
i
think
perhaps
that
goes
to
the
question
of
mootness.
it
is
probably
an
issue
that
needs
to
be
resolved,
even
though
we
opposed
the
granting
of
cert
on
the
ground
of
mootness,
justice
blackmun.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
yes,
they
did,
and
it
was
a
memorandum
decision,
and
it
was
based
on
united
states
v.
harris,
which
was
an
opinion
in
the
ninth
circuit,
and
in
which
the
superseding
indictment
changed
the
offense
and
added
substantive
charges
to
it,
was
not
just
typographical.
but
the
rule
that
this
court
will
interpret
from
congress
will
go
to
everybody.
it
will
cover
not
only
typographical
errors,
which
are
not
the
significant
number
of
superseding
indictments,
but
it
will
cover
mr.
guzman
and
mr.
gallo
who
face
additional
substantial
counts,
and
it
is
the
only
realistic
way
to
read
the
language
of
congress.
it
provides
the
balance
we
need;
it's
efficient,
and
it
places
the
burdens
equally.
i
ask
that
you
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit.
thank
you.
