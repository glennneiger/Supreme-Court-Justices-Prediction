even
if
an
entirely
new
crime
is
added?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
seemed
to
hesitate.
would
you
have
a
question
whether
it
is
a
supervening
indictment
or
superseding
indictment
where
wholly
now
offense
is
alleged?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
may
i
inquire
about
the
relationship
between
the
70
day
limit
and
the
30
day
limit?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
the...
if
the
government
dismisses
the
original
indictment
and
goes
to
trial
on
a
new
or
supervening
indictment,
then
the
trial
has
to
commence
within
70
days
of
the
arraignment
on
the
original
indictment--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--under
the
terms
of
the
statute.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
as
a
matter
of
common
sense,
maybe
the
30
day
preparation
should
run
from
the
same
date.
does
it
make
any
difference
if
the
original
indictment
is
not
dismissed,
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
why
not,
because
the
act
is
so
specific
and
deals
in
one
section
with
a
dismissal
by
the
government
and
in
another
on
motion
of
the
defendant.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
under,
under
what
you
propose,
you
can
have
a
situation
where
the
30
day
period
no
longer
relates
to
the
original
indictment,
but
the
70
day
period
continues
to
relate
back,
and
it
would
be
impossible
for
the
government
to
go
to
trial
at
all,
and
that
is
obviously
an
absurd
result.
so
to
make
the
70
day
period
and
the
30
day
period
co-exist,
you
pretty
much
have
to
adopt
the
rule
that
the
government
espouses
here,
don't
you?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
the
government
dismisses
or
doesn't,
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
isn't
that
a
purely
perfunctory
act
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
why
should
anything
turn
on
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that's
not
this
case.
i
mean,
you...
here
the
government
filed
a
supervening
indictment
to
change
by
a
very
small
margin
what
apparently
was
a
typographical
error
on
the
date.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
still
not
sure
what
your
response
was,
ms.
clarke,
to
justice
marshall's
inquiry
about
what
the
prejudice
to
mr.
rojas-contreras
was
in
this
case
by
virtue
of
the
change.
it
sounded
to
me
like
you
said
her
lost
the
benefit
of
a
windfall
defense
had
the
indictment
not
been
amended.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
understand
your
argument.
now
try
to
answer
this
question:
what
was
the
prejudice?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
wasn't
it?
why
does
the
government
choose
a
supervening
indictment
instead
of
the
amendment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
would
the
government
do
about
the
problem
of
the
subsection
(b)
requirement
of
a
date
relating
to
arrest?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
don't
recall
what
the
rule
provision
is,
if
any,
on
amending
indictments.
what
rule
governs
that?
