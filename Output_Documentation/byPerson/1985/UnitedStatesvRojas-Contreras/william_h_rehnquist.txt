justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
is
mandatory,
as
i
read
it,
from
the
date
on
which
the
defendant
first
appears
through
counsel.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
paraphrasing...
you
just
paraphrased
what
the
conference
submitted
to
congress?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
congress
could
so
easily
have
said
from
the
date
on
which
an
indictment
is
first
returned
if
it
had
meant
what
you
said.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
first
appearance
through
counsel
could
be
at
an
arraignment,
couldn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
they
just
didn't
tie
it
to
indictment
at
all.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
it
can
be
at
an
arraignment--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
it's
not
the
date
of
the
indictment...
i
mean,
the
arraignment
doesn't
necessarily
take
place
on
the
date
of
the
indictment.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
the
change
is
minute,
why
would
he
need
a
continuance?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
to
say
he
makes
a
decision
that
hurts
only
himself,
if
30
unnecessary
days
are
consumed
between
the
time
of
indictment
and
the
time
of
trial,
the
public
is
hurt.
