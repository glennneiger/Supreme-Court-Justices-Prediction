justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
this
question
on
the
harmless
error
situation.
supposing
you
had
a
violation
of
the
70
day
requirement
and
they
didn't
get
to
trial
soon
enough,
and
the
statute
says
there
must
be
a
dismissal
of
the
indictment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
say
there's
some
argument
about
whether
there's
a
violation
or
not,
and
the
district
court
decides
there's
not,
that
the
trial
was
in
time,
there's
an
appeal,
and
the
court
of
appeals
concludes
that
the
70
day
requirement
was
violated.
would
the
government
then
be
in
a
position
to
argue
that
the
violation
was
harmless,
under
your
submission?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
wouldn't
under
the...
a
fair
reading
of
the
language
of
the
harmless
error
rule,
a
court
of
appeals
be
able
to
say,
well,
it
seems
sort
of
silly
to
us,
they
can
dismiss
without
prejudice,
go
through
a
whole
trial
again.
he's
obviously
guilty,
and
71
days
didn't
prejudice
him
at
all.
sure,
the
statute
says
shall
be
dismissed.
there's
just...
it's
a
clear
error,
but
why
couldn't
that
be
harmless?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
would
have
been
another
trial,
and
the
same
evidence
would
go
in,
and
you
prove
him
guilty
all
over
again,
just
spend
a
lot
of
money
to
carry
out
a--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
on
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
are
there
any
decisions
ever
holding
a
violation
of
the
speedy
trial
act
harmless?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
30
day
rule
or
any
other
provision
of
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
a
brand
new
contention,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
it
true
that
if
the
defendant
says
i
need
30
days
and
therefore
extends
the
time,
that
automatically
extends
the
70
day
period,
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
crushing
pressure
isn't
there
if
there's
a
need
for
it.
you've
got
to
assume
the
judges
are
going
to
listen
to
these
motions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
imagine
if
the
defendant
asked
for
another
15
days,
he's
normally
going
to
say
i'll
give
it
to
you
because
it
extends...
it
relieves
them
of
the
70
day
pressure
as
well.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
and
according
to
the
government,
he
was
not
prejudiced
by
the
failure
to
get
it,
either.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
this
again?
you
may
have
already
covered
it
and
i'm
a
little
fuzzy
on
it,
but
justice
rehnquist
has
emphasized
the
fact
the
statute
doesn't
refer
to
indictment,
it
refers
to
the
date
through
which
counsel
appeared,
and
you
say
that
date
refers
precisely
to
what,
the
date
of
the
arraignment
or
the
date
of
the
return
of
the
superseding
indictment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
by
that...
does
that
mean
the
arraignment
date
or
when
he's--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--he's
got...
an
appearance,
if
they
file
a
written
appearance,
as
they
do
in
some
courts,
may
well
have
been
filed
in
advance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
doesn't
say
on
the
superseding
indictment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
he
has
a
lawyer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
already
had
the
lawyer
for
a
couple
of
weeks,
why
isn't
that
satisfied?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
we're...
by
hypothesis,
we
are
dealing
with
cases
where
there
is
no
prejudice.
it
is
a
miniscule
change
in
the
indictment,
and
you
are
saying
congress
commanded
even
in
the
non-prejudice
situation
to
avoid
the
risk
of
prejudice
there
shall
always
be
this
30
day
delay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
do
you
suppose
they
didn't
refer
to
the
your
honor
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
see,
the
other
thing
that's
interesting
is
in
the,
in
(c)(1)
as
i
remember
it,
they
carefully
differentiate
between
the
date
of
the
indictment
and
the
date
of
appearance
through
counsel,
and
say
the
latter
of
the
two
dates
shall
control.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
(c)(1)
says
the
latter
of
the
two
dates.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--not
necessarily
arraignment,
appearance
of
a
judicial
officer
in
which
the
charge
is
pending.
could
that
be
a
preliminary
hearing?
i
was
thinking
that
contemplated
a
situation
in
which
there
might
be
a
hearing
in
advance
of
indictment,
appearance
before
a
judicial
officer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
did
they
say,
i
wonder,
judicial
officer
of
the
court
rather
than
a
judge?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
take
arraignments.
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
the
government
argue
harmless
error
below?
