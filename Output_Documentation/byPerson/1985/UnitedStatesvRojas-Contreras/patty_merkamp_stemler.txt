mr.
patty
merkamp
stemler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
first
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
the
speedy
trial
act
guarantees
a
defendant
a
new
30
day
preparation
period
following
the
return
of
a
superseding
indictment
that
merely
corrects
a
clerical
or
typographical
error.
the
second
question
is
one
of
remedy
and
need
only
be
reached
if
the
first
question
is
decided
adversely
to
the
government,
that
is,
whether
the
harmless
error
rule
applies
to
violations
of
the
defense
preparation
provision,
section
3161(c)(2).
respondent
is
a
mexican
national.
on
february
18,
1983,
an
indictment...
an
indictment
returned
charged
the
respondent
in
two
counts
with
felony
illegal
entry
and
re-entry
by
a
deported
alien.
the
felony
illegal
entry
charge
required
proof
of
a
prior
illegal
entry
conviction.
the
indictment
alleged
that
judgment
had
been
entered
on
that
prior
conviction
on
or
about
december
17,
1981.
that
date
was
a
typographical
error.
in
fact,
the
prior
conviction
had
occurred
on
december
7,
1981.
approximately
one
month
after
the
indictment
was
returned,
respondent
was
provided
with
discovery
that
disclosed
the
correct
date
of
the
prior
conviction,
and
approximately
one
month
after
that
a
superseding
indictment
was
returned
that
corrected
the
typographical
error
in
the
original
indictment.
in
all
other
respects,
the
original
indictment
and
the
superseding
indictment
were
the
same.
at
respondent's
arraignment
on
the
superseding
indictment,
he
demanded
a
30
day
postponement
of
trial.
he
claimed
that
(c)(2),
as
construed
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
united
states
v.
arkus,
guaranteed
him
a
new
preparation
period
after
the
superseding
indictment
was
returned.
he
did
not
claim
that
he
was
either
surprised
or
prejudiced
in
any
way
by
the
correction
of
the
typographical
error.
rather,
he
claimed
that
he
needed
more
time
to
prepare
for
trial
for
two
totally
unrelated
reasons.
one
was
that
he
wanted
to
consult
fingerprint
expert,
and
the
second
was
that
he
wanted
to
review
his
immigration
file.
review
of
the
immigration
file
was
needed
to
defend
the
re-entry
charge
in
count
2.
rather
than
postpone
trial,
the
government
agreed
to
dismiss
count
2,
the
re-entry
charge,
and
respondent
himself
obviated
the
need
for
a
fingerprint
expert
by
stipulating
at
trial
that
he
was
in
fact
the
same
person
who
had
been
convicted
of
illegal
entry
on
december
7,
1981.
mr.
patty
merkamp
stemler
do
i
think
the
case
is
moot?
no,
i
do
not
because
he
has
served
his
sentence.
if...
no,
i
do
not.
i
think
under
this
court's
decisions
in
cibron
and
karafas,
and
also
under
the
ball
decision,
that
the
government
still
has
an
interest
in
re-instating
respondent's
conviction.
if
he
is
ever...
if
he
faces
any
further
prosecutions,
the...
his
criminal
record
will
come
into
play
at
sentencing.
it
may
influence
the
sentence
that
he
receives.
it
can
also
influence
parole
eligibility,
the
number
of
prior
convictions
he
has.
and
therefore,
the
government
has
an
interest
in
seeing
that
the
conviction
is
reinstated
in
this
case.
the
district
court
denied
respondent's
motion
for
a
continuance,
holding
that
(c)(2)
did
not
apply
to
the
superseding
indictment
in
this
case.
the
court
further
found
that
respondent
would
not
be
prejudiced
by
proceeding
to
trial
the
next
day
as
scheduled.
respondent
as
then
convicted
on
the
felony
illegal
entry
charge
and
sentenced.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
his
conviction,
holding
that
under
section
(c)(2)
as
construed
in
another
ninth
circuit
decision,
united
states
v.
harris,
respondent
had
an
absolute
right
to
a
30
day
preparation
period
after
the
superseding
indictment
was
returned.
the
court
further
held
that
the
refusal
to
grant
respondent
a
30
day
delay
of
trial
was
per
se
reversible
error
and
that
no
showing
of
prejudice
was
required.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
trial
must
be
delayed
for
30
days
following
the
return
of
a
superseding
indictment
is
inconsistent
with
the
very
purpose
of
the
speedy
trial
act
which
is
to
accelerate
criminal
trials
to
protect
the
public
by
getting
the
criminal
off
the
streets
as
swiftly
as
possible.
it
brings
about
the
undesirable
result
of
mandating
delays
where
no
additional
preparation
time
is
needed.
the
speedy
trial
act
establishes
both
minimum
and
maximum
time
periods
within
which
trial
must
commence.
for
instance,
trial
must
start
no
later
than
70
days
after
the
return
of
the
indictment
on
the
defendant's
first
court
appearance.
that
70
day
period
is
not
measured
in
consecutive
calendar
days,
but
rather
it
is
subject
to
expansion
by
periods
of
excludable
delay.
one
such
period
is
a
continuance
granted
by
the
judge
to
serve
the
ends
of
justice.
the
act
also
contains
a
minimum
time
period.
that
is
(c)(2),
the
defense
preparation
provision
that
is
at
issue
in
this
case.
(c)(2)
provides
that
trial
shall
not
commence
less
than
30
days
from
the
date
on
which
the
defendant
first
appears
through
counsel
or
expressly
waives
counsel
and
elects
to
proceed
pro
se.
the
language
of
(c)(2)
is
unambiguous,
there
is
only
one
first
appearance
through
counsel
in
any
case.
in
this
case,
that
first
appearance
was
on
february
18
when
respondent
was
arraigned
on
the
original
indictment.
his
trial
did
not
begin
until
59
days
later,
and
therefore
he
clearly
was
given
30
days
within
which
to
prepare
for
trial.
accordingly,
(c)(2)
was
not
violated
in
this
case.
the
use
of
the
term
(c)(2)
by
congress
manifests
congress'
intent
to
guarantee
only
a
single
preparation
period
of
30
days.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
from
which...
that
indicates
that
congress
intended
(c)(2)
to
give
a
defendant
a
second
30
day
preparation
period
after
a
superseding
indictment
was
returned.
in
fact,
whenever
congress
did
want
to
give
a
defendant
a
second
preparation
period,
to
guarantee
a
defendant
a
second
30
day
preparation
period,
it
did
so
explicitly
as
it
did
in
another
provision,
(d)(1).
in
that
case,
where
a
defendant
obtains...
secures
a
dismissal
of
the
original
indictment
and
thereafter
an
indictment
is
returned,
the
act
specifically
states
that
both
the
30
day
minimum
period
and
the
70
day
maximum
start
again.
in
contrast,
the
act
is
structured
so
that
where
a
superseding
indictment
is
returned
and
the
original
indictment
is
dismissed
on
the
government's
motion,
the
time
limits
are
calculated
with
reference
to
the
original
indictment.
congress,
of
course,
recognized
that
30
days
would
not
always
be
sufficient
time
for
a
defendant
to
prepare.
therefore,
in
the
speedy
trial
act
there
is
a
second
provision
that
protects
a
defendant
from
being
rushed
to
trial
before
he
is
ready.
that
second
provision
is
the
ends
of
justice
continuance
provision.
it
stops
the
speedy
trial
clock,
it
allows
a
judge
to
stop
the
clock
by
granting
a
continuance
of
whatever
length
is
necessary
to
accommodate
the
needs
of
a
defendant.
the
length
of
the
continuance
can
be
one,
as
little
as
one
day,
and
it
can
be
as
long
as
40
days
or
50
days
or
longer.
it
is
our
position
that
it
is
this
ends
of
justice
continuance
provision
section
of
the
statute
that
applies
where
a
superseding
indictment
is
returned,
but
that
is
the
section
that
protects
a
defendant
from
being
rushed
on
trial
before
he
is
ready
in
light
of
any
changes
that
have
been
made
in
the
superseding
indictment.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
also
conflicts
with
the
legislative
history
of
the
speedy
trial
act.
the
theme
that
pervades
the
legislative
history
both
in
1974
when
the
statute
was
originally
enacted,
and
again
in
1979
when
it
was
amended,
was
the
desire
of
congress
to
accelerate
criminal
trials.
congress
enacted
the
speedy
trial
act
to
protect
the
public's
right
to
speedy
justice.
as
originally
enacted,
the
statute
contained
only
maximum
time
limits.
there
was
no
mandatory
minimum
preparation
period
for
defendants.
in
1979
congress
considered
amendments
to
the
act.
it
was
urged
by
both
the
department
of
justice
and
the
defense
bar
to
extend
the
maximum
time
limits
of
the
act,
but
congress
held
fast
in
its
view
that
the
minimum
30
day
period...
that
the
70
day
maximum
time
limit
should
be
retained,
that
the
public's
right
to
a
speedy
trial
had
to
be
protected.
instead,
to
ensure
that
a
defendant
was
not
rushed
to
trial
before
he
was
ready,
congress
amended
the
act
in
two
respects.
first,
it
included
(c)(2),
the
mandatory
30
day
preparation
period
which
in
our
view
applies
only
once
in
a
criminal
case.
it
also
amended
the
ends
of
justice
continuance
provision
to
state
specifically
that
a
continuance
could
be
granted
to
accommodate
the
needs
of
defense
counsel
where
additional
preparation
time
was
needed.
both
of
these
amendments
were
derived
from
guidelines
that
had
been
published
earlier
that
year
by
the
second
circuit.
significantly,
the
second
circuit
guidelines
did
not
think
it
was
necessary
to
guarantee
a
defendant
a
30
day
preparation
period
after
a
superseding
indictment
was
returned.
the
guidelines
acknowledged
that
not
all
superseding
indictments
increase
the
burdens
on
defense
counsel.
mr.
patty
merkamp
stemler
a
superseding
indictment,
i
haven't
really...
i
haven't
been
able
to
find
a
definition
of
superseding
indictment,
but
what
i
would
call
a
superseding
indictment
is
one
that
replaces
the
original
indictment
that
charges
offenses
that
arise
from
the
same
transaction
or
series
of
transactions
as
those
offenses
that
were
charged
in
the
original
indictment.
mr.
patty
merkamp
stemler
that
is
correct.
we
don't
dispute
that.
defendants
will
sometimes
need
more
preparation
time.
mr.
patty
merkamp
stemler
that's
right.
it's
not
(c)(2).
mr.
patty
merkamp
stemler
that
is
correct.
that's...
if
the
superseding
indictment
makes
significant--
mr.
patty
merkamp
stemler
--that
is
correct.
again,
it's
our
position
that
it's
not
the...
it's
not
(c)(2)
that
applies
in
that
case
but
instead
it's
the
ends
of
justice
continuance
provision
that
will
protect
the
defendant
there.
mr.
patty
merkamp
stemler
that
is
correct.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
way
to--
mr.
patty
merkamp
stemler
--i
think
that
as
long
as
the
offense
is
related
to
the
other...
the
offenses
that
were
charged
in
the
original
indictment--
mr.
patty
merkamp
stemler
--right,
that
(c)(2)
would
not
apply,
that
instead,
the
appropriate
provision
to
protect
the
defendant
in
that
case
would
be
the
ends
of
justice
continuance
provision.
the
problem
is,
if
(c)(2)
applies
to
superseding
indictments,
and
i
think
the
way
the
statute
is
written,
it
either
applies
or
it
doesn't
apply,
i
don't
think
(c)(2)
was
intended
to
apply
in
certain
circumstances
and
not
in
others,
it
seems
to
be
more
of
a
hard
and
fast
rule,
the
problem
with
applying
it
to
superseding
indictments
is
that
the
statute
itself
will
not
work
in
that
situation.
if
a
defendant
where
a
superseding
indictment
is
returned,
the
government
has
to
bring
the
defendant
to
trial
within
70
days
of
the
return
of
the
original
indictment.
if
he
is
guaranteed
under
(c)(2)
a
new
30
day
preparation
period,
that
70
day
limit
may
be
exceeded.
this
case
is
a
perfect
illustration
of
that
point.
when
respondent
was
arraigned
on
the
superseding
indictment,
57
speedy
trial
days
had
already
elapsed.
that
meant
that
the
government
only
had
13
days
left
within
which
to
bring
respondent
to
trial.
had
he
been
given
a
new
30
day
preparation
period
under
(c)(2),
we
would
have
exceeded
the
70
day
maximum
by
17
days,
and
he
would
have
been
entitled
to
dismissal
of
the
indictment
under
the
mandatory
sanction
provision.
congress
clearly
could
not
have
intended
to
place
the
government
in
the
predicament
of
either
trying
a
case
too
early
or
too
late.
instead,
if
the
ends
of
justice
continuance
provision
is
used
to
protect
a
defendant
after
a
superseding
indictment
is
returned,
this
predicament
does
not
occur.
the
ends
of
justice
continuance
provision,
unlike
(c)(2),
stops
the
speedy
trial
clock
so
that
if
57
days
have
already
elapsed
and
an
ends
of
justice
continuance
is
granted,
let's
say,
of
20
days,
the
clock
will
stop,
the
defendant
will
have
his
20
days
of
preparation
time,
and
the
clock
will
begin
running
again,
and
then
the
government
will
still
have
an
opportunity
to
try
him
within
the
70
day
limit.
moreover,
it
simply
makes
no
sense
to
delay
trial
simply
because
a
typographical
error
has
been
corrected
in
the
indictment.
mr.
patty
merkamp
stemler
yes.
mr.
patty
merkamp
stemler
that
is
correct.
mr.
patty
merkamp
stemler
that
is
correct.
mr.
patty
merkamp
stemler
no,
it
doesn't
make,
shouldn't
make
any
difference.
the
feldman
case--
mr.
patty
merkamp
stemler
--if
the
original
indictment
is
dismissed
on
motion
of
the
defendant,
the
defendant
does
get
a
new
30
day
preparation
period
under
(d)(1).
however,
if
a
superseding
indictment
is
returned
and
the
government
forgets
to
take
care
of
the
housekeeping
matter--
mr.
patty
merkamp
stemler
--of
dismissing
that
original
indictment,
that
should
have
no
effect
on
whether
or
not
the
defendant
gets
a
new
defense,
new
mandatory
preparation
period
under
(c)(2).
the
feldman
case
from
the
seventh
circuit
attempts
to
make
that
distinction.
mr.
patty
merkamp
stemler
but
in
my
view,
that's
an
irrational
distinction.
a
defendant's
preparation
needs,
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
itself
that
seems
to
support
the
distinction
of
giving
a
defendant
30
days
where
we
remembered...
where
we
forget
to
dismiss
the
indictment
but
not
giving
him
30
days
where
we
remember
to
dismiss
the
original
indictment.
superseding
indictments
are
also
returned
for
purposes
like
dropping
defendants
or
dismissing
certain
counts,
in
which
case
it
is
clear
that
a
defendant
would
not
need
additional
preparation
time,
that
in
those
instances
the
preparation
task
of
defense
counsel
is
simplified.
if
(c)(2)
is
read
to
apply
to
superseding
indictments,
there
will
be
mandatory
30
day
delays
in
those
situations
where
clearly
no
additional
preparation
time
is
needed.
this
mandatory
delay
of
trial
not
only
gets
into
the...
gets
us
into
the
predicament
that
i
had
described
earlier,
but
also
is
contrary
to
the
very
purpose
of
the
speedy
trial
act.
the
act
was
enacted
to
accelerate
trials,
to
protect
the
public,
and
therefore
it
should
not
be
construed
in
a
manner
that
would
be
antithetical
to
that
purpose
by
mandating
unnecessary
delays.
to
reiterate,
it
is
not
our
position
that
a
defendant
never
is
entitled
to
a
continuance
after
a
superseding
indictment
is
returned.
certainly
some
superseding
indictments
will
substantially
alter
the
charges
in
a
way
that
will
require
the
defendant
to
do
additional
preparation,
but
the
defendant
is
adequately
protected
by
the
ends
of
justice
continuance
provision
in
those
situations.
the
due
process
clause
and
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
also
will
ensure
that
a
defendant
is
not
rushed
to
trial
before
he
is
ready.
even
if
the
court
disagrees
with
our
construction
of
the
defense
preparation
provision,
the
court
below
erred
in
holding
that
the
violation
required
reversal.
there
is
nothing
in
the
speedy
trial
act
that
says
that
violations
of
(c)(2)
should
be
exempt
from
the
harmless
error
rule.
indeed,
the
speedy
trial
act
is
filled
with
various
sanctions
for
violations
of
its
provisions.
it
requires
dismissal
if
the
70
day
limit
is
exceeded.
there
are
disciplinary
sanctions
for
attorneys
who
intentionally
delay
trial.
in
each
instance
that...
in
which
congress
has
provided
a
specific
sanction,
congress
was
punishing
delay
rather
than
speed.
therefore,
there's
no...
no
reason
to
believe
that
congress
intended
to
mandate
reversal
where
the
defendant
has
not
been
prejudiced
by
a
violation
of
(c)(2).
in
this
case
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
return
of
the
superseding
indictment
shortly
before
trial
did
not
prejudice
respondent
in
any
way.
he
had
been
provided
with
discovery
a
month
earlier
disclosing
the
correct
date
of
his
prior
conviction.
he
claimed
no
surprise
or
prejudice
by
the
change
that
had
been
made
in
the
superseding
indictment.
the
claim--
mr.
patty
merkamp
stemler
--right.
mr.
patty
merkamp
stemler
no.
i
think
we
could
not.
the
way
the
statute
is
written,
dismissal
is
mandatory
where
the
70
day
limit
has
been
violated.
i
think
by
including
that
mandatory
dismissal
sanction,
congress
has
preempted
the
harmless
error
rule
for
that
situation.
the
statute
does
provide,
however,
that
the
dismissal
can
be
with
or
without
prejudice.
if
it's
without
prejudice,
the
government
can
reindict
and
then
try
the
defendant
again.
that's...
that
is,
i
don't
know
if
you
want
to
call
that
a
version
of
harmless
error
or
what
you
want
to
call
that,
but
if
we
get
a
dismissal
without
prejudice,
we
do
have
the
opportunity
to
start
the
case
over
by
reindicting.
mr.
patty
merkamp
stemler
in
other
words,
say
that
the
remedy
the
defendant
would
have
been
entitled
to
is
dismissal
without
prejudice,
and
therefore
why--
mr.
patty
merkamp
stemler
--it's
possible
that
the
courts
could
do
that.
there
aren't
any
decisions
doing
that
yet,
but
that
has
been
done
in
some
analogous--
mr.
patty
merkamp
stemler
--not
a
violation--
mr.
patty
merkamp
stemler
--no.
there...
no.
there
have
been--
mr.
patty
merkamp
stemler
--there
have
been...
there
have
been...
yes,
there
have
been.
there
have
been
harmless
error...
i
believe
that
there
have
been
some
cases
saying
that
violations
of
the...
there's
sort
of
a
detainer
section,
3161(j)
in
the
statute,
that
provides
for
giving
notice
to
defendants
who
are
incarcerated
elsewhere,
serving
sentences
elsewhere,
that
they
have
a
right
to
a
speedy
trial,
and
i
think
the
courts
of
appeals
have
held
that
violations
of
that
provision
have
been
held
harmless.
also
i
think...
well,
i
think
that
may
be
the
only
situation
that
has
generated
a
harmless
error
ruling.
the...
as
far
as
the
violations
of
the
70
day
limit,
the
courts
have
always
held
that
harmless
error
does
not
apply,
and
it's
simply
a
matter
of
determining
whether
the
dismissal
is
with
or
without
prejudice.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
will
save
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
patty
merkamp
stemler
just
a
few
points,
your
honor.
before
responding
to
the
arguments
that
have
been
made
by
respondent,
i
would
like
to
address
a
question
that
justice
stevens
had
asked
me.
the
case
that
has
found
a
violation
of
3161(j)
to
be
harmless
is
united
states
v.
anderton.
it's
from
the
fifth
circuit,
and
it's
cited
on
page
41
of
our
brief,
i
believe
in
a
footnote.
if
i
understand
the
thrust
of
respondent's
argument,
it
is
that
unless
you
guarantee
a
defendant
30
days
preparation
time
after
a
superseding
indictment
is
returned,
defendants
won't
get
the
time
they
need
because
we
can't
depend
on
the
district
courts
to
grant
continuances
to
accommodate
the
actual
needs
of
defense
counsel.
of
course,
we've
been
depending
on
the
district
courts
to
do
that
for
two
centuries,
certainly
long
before
1974
when
the
speedy
trial
act
was
enacted
and
before
1979
when
(c)(2)
was
put
into
the
statute.
and
in
any
case,
wherever
a
district
court
improperly
denies
a
continuance,
the
defendant
has
an
appellate
remedy.
that's
exactly
what
happened
to
mr.
guzman
to
whom
respondent
referred,
in
the
second
circuit.
the
second
circuit
found
that
mr.
guzman
should
have
been
given
a
discretionary
continuance
after
the
superseding
indictment
was
returned,
and
therefore
his
conviction
was
reversed.
therefore,
there's
no
need
to
construe
(c)(2)
to
apply
across
the
biard
to
all
superseding
indictments
to
mandate
delays
in
every
case
simply
because
some
judge
somewhere
might
make
a
mistake
on
granting
a
discretionary
continuance.
respondent
also
argues
that
(c)(2),
that
the
predicament
that
i
had
discussed
in
my
argument
can
be
eliminated
it
(c)(2)
is
considered
to
be
a
period
of
excludable
delay
where
it
is
triggered
after
a
superseding
indictment
is
returned.
there
is
simply
no
basis
for
that
argument
in
the
statute.
all
the
periods
of
excludable
delay
are
enumerated
in
subsection
(h).
they
are
all
put
in
together.
the
30
day
mandatory
preparation
period
is
not
a
period
of
excludable
delay,
it
doesn't
stop
the
speedy
trial
clock.
the
clock
continues
to
run
while
the
defendant
gets
that
first
30
day
preparation
period.
and
finally,
respondent
suggests
that
he
was
prejudiced
in
this
case
by
the
return
of
the
superseding
indictment
because
it
deprived
him
of
a
defense.
that's
not
so.
the
indictment
in
this
case
could
have
been
correct...
the
typographical
error
could
have
been
corrected
by
way
of
amendment,
but
even
if
we
had
gone
to
trial
on
the
original
indictment--
mr.
patty
merkamp
stemler
--i
think
it's
just
the
choice
of
the
individual
prosecutor,
and
there
is
nothing
to
reflect,
in
the
record
that
reflects
why
in
this
case
they
chose
to
get
the
superseding
indictment
rather
than
to
ask
the
court
to
amend
the
indictment.
but
even--
mr.
patty
merkamp
stemler
--that's
right,
the
courts
of
appeals
have
addressed
the
question
of
whether
a
superseding
indictment
has
to
be
returned
within
30
days
of
arrest
and
have
uniformly
held
that
it
does
not,
that
only
the
original
indictment
has
to
be
returned
within
30
days
of
arrest.
so
we
don't
get
into
any
problem
with
subsection
(b)
where
we
return
superseding
indictments
after
those
30
days
have
elapsed.
at
worst,
had
we
gone
to
trial
in
this
case
on
the
original
indictment
an
the
proof
had
shown
that
the
prior
conviction
was
on
december
7
rather
than
december
17,
that
would
have
been
an
immaterial
variance,
and
respondent
could
still
have
been
convicted
of
the
felony
illegal
entry
charge.
so
respondent
was
not
deprived
of
a
cognizable
defense.
there
is
simply
nothing
in
the
record
that
shows
that
the
defendant
was
prejudiced
in
any
way,
and
therefore
it's
completely
at
odds
with
the
purpose
of
the
speedy
trial
act
to
reverse
the
conviction
in
this
case
simply
because
a
needless
delay
was
not
given,
that
the
delay
was...
that
the
trial
was
not
unnecessarily
delayed
for
30
days.
mr.
patty
merkamp
stemler
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
it's...
respondent
says
rule
7,
but
i
am
not
sure,
your
honor.
therefore,
we
ask
the
court
to
reverse
the
judgment
below.
thank
you.
