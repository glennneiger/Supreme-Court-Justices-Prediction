justice
john
paul
stevens
general
cody,
can
i
interrupt
you
with
a
factual
question?
as
i
understand
it,
with
respect
to
one
of
the
killings,
he
was
convicted
of
first
degree
murder
and
with
respect
to
the
other
it
was
second
degree
murder.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
one?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
take
it
the
harmless
error
inquiry
would
be
whether
there
was
no
possibility
or
no
reasonable
possibility
that
the
first
degree
murder
conviction
might
have
been
a
second
degree
murder
conviction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
larkin,
can
i
interrupt?
it
is
pretty
much
the
same
question
i
asked
before,
but
are
you
saying
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
they
would
have
found
him
not
guilty
or
they
could
not
have
found
a
murder
one
conviction
to
be
a
murder
two
conviction?
that
is
the
thing
that
puzzles
me.
i
would
have
thought
the
evidence
is
overwhelming
as
to
murder
one
on
both
victims,
but
the
jury
apparently
didn't.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
that
is
true
then,
maybe
the
harm
of
the
presumption
was
that
it
was
prejudicial
as
to
the
one
that
was
found
guilty
of
second
degree
murder.
maybe
without
the
instruction
they
would
have
found
manslaughter
or
something
else.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
tennessee
law,
mr.
daniel?
in
this
case,
as
i
understand
it,
the
tennessee
court
of
appeals
didn't
think
there
was
any
error
at
all,
therefore,
didn't
confront
the
question
of
whether
it
might
have
been
harmless
had
there
been
error.
does
tennessee
follow
a
harmless
error
rule
in
cases
like
this
in
other
state
cases,
do
you
know,
or
have
they
decided?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
the
same
test
as
in
chapman
against
california?
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
cody,
can
i
ask
just
one
last
question,
please?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
your
position
that
we
should
make
the
harmless
error
determination
or
send
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
do
so?
