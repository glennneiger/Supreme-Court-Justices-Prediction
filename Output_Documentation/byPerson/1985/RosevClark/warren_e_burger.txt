we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
rose
against
clark.
mr.
attorney
general?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
you
tell
us,
mr.
attorney
general,
that
there
was
no
objection
to
the
instructions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
you
are
suggesting
that
the
narrow
question
presented
here
is
the
harmless
error
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
because
of
the
overwhelming
evidence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
larkin?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
the
defendant
undertake
to
prove
an
alibi
in
any
way
that
he
wasn't
there
and
that
two
other
people
had
committed
the
crime?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
is
up.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
daniel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
now
arguing
there
is
some
doubt
about
the
guilt
of
this
man?
i
thought
we
had
the
case
only
on
the
issue
of
harmless
error.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
you
do
not
concede
the
evidence
of
guilt
was
overwhelming
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
on
the
question
of
malice,
does
this
record
show
with
respect
to
the
examination
by
the
psychiatrist
whether
he
had
any
recollection
of
having
threatened
to
do
these
killings?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
psychiatrist
didn't
ask
him
whether
he
recalled
that
when
they
are
dealing
with
his
capacity
for
recollection?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
suggest
that
there
was
not
abundant
evidence
on
the
malice
issue
apart
from
the
instruction?
just
looking
at
the
evidence,
do
you
say
this
record
does
not
contain
overwhelming
evidence
of
malice?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
first,
he
had
threatened
the
man.
second,
he
was
seen
to
have
pursued
him,
and,
third,
while
pursuing
him,
he
was
himself
armed,
and,
fourth,
he
blocked
the
victim's
car
so
that
the
victim
couldn't
get
away.
how
could
you
find
more
evidence
of
malice
than
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
when
it
is
coupled
with
going
ahead
of
the
man
and
blocking
the
victim's
car,
does
that
tell
you
something
about
the
purpose
of
the
pursuit?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
there
not
something
there
on
which
reasonable
people
could
draw
certain
inferences?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
thought
you
had
earlier
conceded
that
the
evidence
here
was
overwhelming.
now
you
are
challenging
the
evidence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then,
let's
take
your
position
that
it
is
merely
sufficient
to
support
the
verdict.
then,
why
is
it
relevant
to
be
dealing
with
these
peripheral
things
about
suggesting
that
maybe
he
isn't
really
the
guilty
man.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
tennessee
in
cases
generally
follow
the
general
rule
on
inconsistent
verdicts
of
juries,
the
general
law
on
that
subject?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
you
have
anything
further
mr.
attorney
general?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
