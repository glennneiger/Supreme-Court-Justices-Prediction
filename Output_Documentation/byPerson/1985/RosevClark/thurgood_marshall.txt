if
the
jury
in
this
case
had
found
him
guilty
of
both
in
first
degree,
would
you
make
the
same
argument?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
can
you
make
a
different
argument?
you
say
it
was
harmless
error.
how
could
it
be
harmless
if
it
could
come
out
two
different
ways?
you
admitted
it
yourself.
you
have
argued
here...
you
and
the
general
have
argued
this
is
the
clearest
case
of
premeditated
murder
that
ever
came
down
the
block.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
jury
didn't
agree.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
can
it
be
so
clear?
how
is
it
so
clear?
justice
thurgood
marshall
didn't
the
other
man
have
a
gun
in
his
pocket?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
it
is
clear.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
clear
he
had
a
gun.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
not
arguing
that
it
isn't
possible
for
the
jury
to
say
it,
but
to
say
that
it
is
clear
that
the
jury
had
to
come
out
this
way
and
no
other
way.
i
don't
see
how
you
can
say
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
daniel,
why
don't
you
argue
the
case
we
asked
you
to
argue?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean,
it
is
your
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
wouldn't
have
killed
her
because
he
loved
her.
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he
love
the
man
too
that
he
killed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but,
he
didn't
testify.
