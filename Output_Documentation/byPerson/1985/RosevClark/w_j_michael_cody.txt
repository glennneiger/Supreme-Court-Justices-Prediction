mr.
w.
j.
michael
cody
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
on
the
night
of
december
30,
1978,
joy
faulk
and
charles
browning
were
shot
to
death
in
a
rural
area
of
rutherford
county,
tennessee.
the
respondent
clark
was
indicted
by
the
grand
jury
on
two
counts
of
first
degree
murder.
following
a
jury
trial,
he
was
convicted
of
the
first
degree
murder
of
joy
faulk
and
given
life
imprisonment
and
the
second
degree
murder
of
charles
browning
and
given
ten
years
imprisonment.
the
malice
instructions
were
not
challenged
at
trial,
but
later
challenged
on
appeal.
the
state
appellate
court
affirmed
the
jury
verdict
and
the
tennessee
supreme
court
denied
permission
to
appeal.
the
petition
for
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
which
alleged
the
malice
instructions
violated
due
process
pursuant
to
sandstrom
versus
montana,
was
granted
by
the
district
court
and
this
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
this
grant
of
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
is
limited
to
the
question
of
whether
error
in
the
trial
court's
jury
instructions
on
malice
was
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
extremely
important.
joy
faulk
and
the
respondent
had
been
involved
in
a
stormy
relationship
prior
to
faulk
terminating
that
relationship
several
months
before
the
slayings.
following
their
breakup,
the
respondent
threatened
on
six
different
occasions
to
kill
faulk
if
he
ever
caught
her
with
another
man.
two
weeks
before
the
slayings,
the
respondent
borrowed
the
murder
weapon,
a
25
caliber
automatic
pistol,
after
untruthfully
indicating
that
his
own
gun
had
been
stolen.
several
days
before
the
slayings,
the
respondent
spoke
to
browning's
wife
for
the
purpose
of
determining
the
relationship
and
during
the
course
of
the
conversation
he
twice
stated
that
he
wanted
to
find
out
about
browning
and
faulk's
relationship
before
he
did
what
he
had
to
do.
and,
at
the
time
he
made
those
statements,
he
was
in
the
possession
of
the
murder
weapon.
now,
prior
to
the
commission
of
the
crimes,
the
respondent's
truck
was
observed
pursuing
browning's
truck
in
which
faulk
and
her
two
daughters
were
passengers
along
the
road.
some
ten
miles
from
this
observation,
browning
pulled
into
a
private
driveway,
either
to
let
the
respondent
pass
or
to
seek
safety.
at
that
time,
the
respondent
parked
his
truck
immediately
behind
browning's,
thereby
blocking
any
escape,
and
left
the
lights
on,
then
immediately
went
to
the
browning
truck,
put
his
pistol
inside
the
cab
and
fired
the
weapon
at
least
four
times
at
point-blank
range.
browning,
who
was,
of
course,
the
driver
of
the
truck,
had
a
fully
loaded
22
caliber
pistol
in
his
right
pants
pocket.
the
pistol
contained
one
spent
cartridge
which
the
evidence
is
clear
was
positioned
so
that
it
could
not
have
just
been
fired.
he
could
not
have
removed
the
pistol
from
his
pocket
before
he
was
shot.
browning
was
shot
once
in
the
head
from
a
distance
of
six
to
eight
inches
and
faulk
was
shot
three
times,
twice
in
the
head
and
once
in
the
left
shoulder,
from
a
distance
of
less
than
18
inches.
both
browning's
and
faulk's
brains
were
obliterated
by
the
head
wounds
in
this
case.
physical
evidence
at
the
scene
indicated
that
the
respondent
fired
his
weapon
almost
immediately
after
causing
browning
to
stop
his
truck.
browning's
foot
was
still
on
the
brake
pedal.
the
motor
in
the
truck
was
on,
the
radio
was
playing,
the
headlights
were
on,
the
driver's
window
was
down,
and
the
passenger's
window
was
up.
and,
finally,
after
the
respondent
fled
the
scene
of
the
murder,
faulk's
two
daughters
who
miraculously
not
injured
in
the
shooting,
crawled
over
the
bodies
and
were
found
wandering
around
the
roadway
seeking
assistance.
shortly
thereafter
the
respondent
led
the
police
on
a
high-speed
chase
at
which
time
he
discarded
the
murder
weapon
prior
to
his
apprehension
by
the
police.
that
night
and
at
the
trial,
joy
faulk's
daughter
identified
the
respondent
as
the
individual
responsible
for
killing
her
mother
and
browning.
now,
the
primarily
issue
litigated
at
the
trial
of
this
case
was
the
identity
of
the
murderer.
the
respondent
sought
to
prove
that
someone
else
did
it.
he
mentioned
two
other
individuals
that
he
thought
did
it.
but,
given
the
overwhelming
evidence
that
he
had
committed
the
murder,
the
respondent,
who
did
not
testify,
also
attempted
to
say
that
if
he
did
it
he
was
temporarily
insane,
he
was
voluntarily
intoxicated,
he
had
amnesia
and
didn't
remember
it
at
the
time.
the
jury
instructions
given
in
this
case
by
the
trial
judge
were
extensive
and
went
into
the
first
and
second
degree
murders
and
the
elements
of
those
offenses,
told
the
jury
to
consider
the
instructions
as
a
whole,
that
the
state
had
the
burden
of
proof,
the
defendant
had
the
presumption
of
innocence,
but
the
court
gave
the
two
sandstrom
type
instructions,
one
which
said
homicides
are
presumed
to
be
malicious
in
the
absence
of
evidence
to
rebut,
but
that
rebuttal
evidence
could
be
direct
or
circumstantial
and
either
from
the
state
or
from
the
defendant.
and,
secondly,
if
a
deadly
weapon
is
used
under
certain
circumstances,
then
malice
could
be
presumed
to
support
a
second
degree
murder
conviction
unless
it
is
rebutted
by
other
facts
and
circumstances.
mr.
w.
j.
michael
cody
justice,
they
were
very--
mr.
w.
j.
michael
cody
--justice,
i
think
very
clearly
they
were
rebuttable
presumptions.
i
do
not
believe
there
is
any
contention
made
that
this
was
a
conclusive
presumption.
the
tennessee
court
of
criminal
appeals
held
that
these
instructions
did
not
violate
sandstrom
and,
further,
that
the
respondent
could
not
have
been
prejudiced
in
view
of
his
sole
defenses
of
non-participation
and
insanity.
the
federal
district
court,
however,
found
that
the
element
of
malice
was
a
disputed
issue
at
trial
because
of
the
defenses
and
refused
to
find
it
harmless.
mr.
w.
j.
michael
cody
there
were
no
objections
whatsoever
to
the
instructions
during
the
trial.
the
error
was
not
alleged
in
the
motion
for
a
new
trial,
but
some
three
months
after
the
trial
in
a
supplemental
motion
for
a
new
trial
the
error
was
then
claimed.
the
sixth
circuit,
as
i
indicated,
agreed
with
the
district
court
and
declined
to
reverse
the
district
court
despite
its
findings
of
the
substantial
evidence
of
the
defendant's
guilt.
and,
the
sixth
circuit
indicated
in
its
opinion
that
were
it
not
for
its
prior
precedent
that
it
would
inquire
itself
as
to
whether
the
evidence
of
malice
was
so
dispositive
of
intent
to
be
able
to
say
that
the
jury
would
have
found
it
unnecessary
to
rely
on
the
presumption
in
determining
whether
the
erroneous
instructions
prejudiced
the
respondent.
but,
they
felt
bound
by
earlier
precedent,
primarily,
we
believe,
based
upon
the
kohler
case
out
of
michigan
which
allowed
a
diminished
capacity
defense
to
be
used.
it
is
a
proper
defense
in
michigan
but
it
is
not
a
proper
defense
in
tennessee,
and,
of
course,
was
not
charged
in
these
jury
instructions.
mr.
w.
j.
michael
cody
yes.
mr.
w.
j.
michael
cody
the
first
degree
murder
was
the
murder
of
joy
faulk,
the
woman
who
was
shot
twice
in
the
head
and
once
in
the
shoulder.
and,
of
course,
this
was
the
respondent's
former
girlfriend
who
he
had
said,
if
i
ever
catch
you
out
with
someone
i
will
kill
you.
browning,
which
was
the
second
degree
murder
conviction...
it
was
based
upon
that
he
was
the
person
that
she
was
found
with
on
that
occasion.
mr.
w.
j.
michael
cody
i
think
the
inquiry
could
go
to
both,
but
i
believe
that
it
is
very
clear
in
this
case
that
the
overwhelming...
first
of
all,
on
the
first
degree
charge,
there
is
no
question
that
premeditation
and
deliberation
and
willfulness
were
all
properly
charged.
and,
under
tennessee
law,
voluntary
intoxication,
for
instance,
is
not
a
defense
to
second
degree
murder.
it
is
only
a
defense
to
premeditation
and
deliberation
aspects.
so,
we
believe
that
any
jury
which,
under
these
facts,
would
have
found
that
the
murder
was
committed
premeditatively
and
deliberately
and
wilfully.
under
these
facts,
multiple
shots
within
the
cab
of
the
truck
at
point-blank
range
would
have
also
found
malice
and
could
have
certainly
not
have
been
harmful.
now,
maybe
the
court...
in
response
to
your
question,
belatedly
the
respondent
in
this
court
for
the
first
time
has
raised
a
self-defense
claim.
self-defense
was
never
raised
anywhere
below,
it
was
never
argued,
it
was
never
charged
to
find,
but
certainly
with
respect
to
the
first
degree
murder
of
joy
faulk,
who
didn't
even
have
a
pistol
in
her
pocket
and
was
sitting
on
the
far
side
of
the
truck...
both
victims
were
seated...
there
could
be
no
indication.
if
the
court
please,
the
state
of
tennessee
submits
first
that
the
jury
instructions
in
this
case
which
incorporate
a
rebuttable
presumption
on
the
element
of
malice
alone,
are
subject
to
analysis
under
the
harmless
error
doctrine.
second,
that
the
existence
of
malice
was
not
placed
in
dispute
by
either
of
the
two
defenses
raised
by
the
respondent.
and,
third
and
finally,
in
any
event,
the
evidence
of
malice
in
this
case,
on
the
facts
and
the
entire
trial,
is
overwhelming
and
that
the
respondent
was
not
prejudiced
by
the
instructions.
mr.
w.
j.
michael
cody
well,
justice--
mr.
w.
j.
michael
cody
--it
is
difficult
to
answer
that
question.
we
did
not
think
that
there
was
any
basic
error
in
this
rebuttable
presumption,
but
the
court
has
granted
certiorari
only
on
the
question
of
whether
it
was
harmless
and
that
is
the
reason
that
we
only
raised
that
point.
mr.
w.
j.
michael
cody
yes,
that
is
the
only
question
upon
which
certiorari--
mr.
w.
j.
michael
cody
--yes,
if
the
court
please.
and,
we
think
that
an
erroneous
rebuttable
presumption
on
malice
in
this
case
shouldn't
be
in
any
way
classified
as
error
so
basic
to
denying
a
fair
trial
as
to
require
an
automatic
reversal
regardless
of
the
facts
and
legal
significance
of
the
defenses.
and,
we
believe
if
the
court
analyzes
the
record
in
this
case
and
the
evidence
and
defenses
presented
that
it
would
find
a
harmless
error
clearly
and
reverse
the
court
of
appeals.
with
the
court's
permission,
i
would
like
to
leave
what
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
w.
j.
michael
cody
if
the
court
please,
with
your
indulge
just
mention
two
very
short
points.
one,
the
evidence
in
this
case
which
i
recited
in
the
opening
statement,
i
believe,
is
taken
almost
verbatim
from
the
tennessee
court
of
criminal
appeals'
findings.
and,
with
respect,
i
believe,
to
justice
powell's
question
about
the
psychiatrist's
knowledge
of
the
prior
threats,
on
page
129
of
the
record,
dr.
roger
white,
psychiatrist,
is
asked,
would
it
have
helped
you
to
have
known
past
threats
that
this
defendant
made
toward
the
victim.
the
answer
was
in
this
particular
case
and
considering
the
special
nature
of
my
contact
with
him,
probably
not.
my
opinion
is
based
largely
on
my
contact
with
him
and
his
response
to
a
special
form
of
examination.
mr.
w.
j.
michael
cody
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
j.
michael
cody
that
this
court
should.
thank
you.
