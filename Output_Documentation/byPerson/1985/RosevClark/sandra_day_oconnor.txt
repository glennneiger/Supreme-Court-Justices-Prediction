justice
sandra
day
o'connor
general
cody,
would
you
say
that
the
instructions
here
were
like
those
in
the
case
of
connecticut
versus
johnson
and
were
conclusive
presumptions
or
were
these
instructions,
in
your
view,
rebuttable
presumptions?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
had
the
effect
of
maybe
shifting
the
burden
to
the
defendant.
