mr.
scott
daniel
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
petitioner
takes
the
position
based
upon
a
view
of
the
facts
which
i
think
justice
marshall's
last
question
kind
of
pinpointed.
they
view
the
facts
only
in
their
view
of
how
it
had
to
be
from
their
standpoint
of
looking
at
it
rather
than
looking
at
it
in
a
multitude
of
ways
in
which
a
jury
can
consider.
if
they
are
arguing
sufficiency
of
evidence,
that
is
one
thing,
but
they
are
not.
that
is
not
the
point
here
raised
at
issue.
and,
before
i
go
into
the
matters
that
i
want
to
specifically
address
for
the
point
of
view
of
my
own
presentation,
are
some
matters
which
the
petitioner
has
stated
here
which
i
think
need
to
be
touched
upon.
first
of
all,
they
said
the
malice
instruction
was
not
challenged
at
the
trial.
i
think
this
is
pointed
out
clearly
in
the
briefs
and
the
record
that
under
tennessee
law
you
are
not
required
to
object
to
the
instructions
at
the
time
it
is
given.
it
is
proper
to
object
to
them
under
the
rules
by
including
that
in
your
motion
for
a
new
trial
which
we
did
appropriately
and
timely.
the
court
of
appeals
acknowledging
this,
then
considered
the
matter
and
heard
it
on
the
merits
with
regard
to
this.
so,
there
is
no
question
about
any
waiver
aspects
here.
now,
they
have
stated
here
as
to
the
facts,
their
view
of
the
facts,
and
just
to
give
you
an
illustration,
they
say
someone
was
following
them
for
ten
miles.
the
only
evidence
of
what
was
going
on
was
that
the...
there
was
nothing
done.
the
police
officer
saw
the
cars,
didn't
pursue
it.
there
wasn't
any
high
speed
chase
at
that
time,
there
wasn't
anything
going
on.
he
simply
followed
and
said
he
didn't
see
any
reason
to
do
anything.
mr.
scott
daniel
well,
we
did,
and
i
wasn't
intending
to
do
that.
i
respond
to
that
only
because
they
argued
a
moment
ago...
they
have
given
what
i
think
is
a
biased
interpretation
of
what
actually
occurred
as
to
whether
or
not
the
jury
could
have,
under
another
view
of
the
facts,
determined
whether
the
evidence
was
overwhelming
from
their
standpoint
of
looking
at
it.
i
would
not
concede
that
point
is
all
i
am
saying.
mr.
scott
daniel
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not.
we
concede
it
was
great
evidence,
substantial
evidence
viewed
from
one
standpoint,
but
not
so
overwhelming
as
to
dictate
the
result,
and
clearly,
i
think,
is
the
indication
of
justice
marshall's
question
a
moment
ago,
it
shows
the
conclusions
could
not
be
that
concrete
as
the
petitioner
takes
the
position
of
the
facts.
now,
what
we
suggest
and
what
we
have
submitted
throughout
the
case
is...
and,
they
state
again
that
the
primary
issue
at
trial
was
that
someone
else
did
it.
let
me
explain
that
at
the
trial,
my
client,
mr.
clark,
through
the
testimony
of
two
psychiatrists
who
testified
in
his
behalf,
was
found
to
have
amnesia,
such
that
they
said,
first
of
all,
we
don't
know
if
he
was
there,
but
we
are
convinced
that
he
doesn't
know
if
he
was
there.
if
he
was
there,
he
has
absolutely
no
recollection
of
having
anything
to
do
with
the
events
here.
so,
that
is
the
evidence
that
we
offered
and
which
we
presented
at
trial.
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
question
about
that.
they
said
that
if,
in
fact,
he
committed
the
crimes
he
was
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
and
this
was
the
defense
we
relied
upon
as
well
as
the
fact
that
we,
from
the
outset,
contended,
number
one,
mr.
clark,
the
defendant,
had
no
recollection
of
the
events,
had
insanity,
therefore
could
not
present
an
alternative
version
out
of
his
own
mouth.
the
only
witness
to
it
was
a
little
girl,
a
six-year
old
girl,
whose
testimony,
by
the
statement
of
the
trial
judge,
was
so
contractive
and
impeached,
and
he
said
impeached,
that
he
allowed
into
evidence
out-of-court
statements
that
she
had
made
in
which
she
had
said
specifically,
and
there
are
other
witnesses
who
agreed,
that
they
are
fighting,
they
have
guns,
they
are
fighting,
so
that
there
was
clearly
a
fight
going
on.
mr.
scott
daniel
amnesia
in
and
of
itself
was
not
preclude
intent
to
kill,
no,
i
wouldn't
argue
that.
what
i
am
saying
is
our
evidence
was...
our
psychiatric
evidence
was
that
if,
in
fact,
he
did
the
acts
charged,
he
was
not
responsible
for
them
because
he
did
not
have
the
mental
capacity
at
the
time
the
actions
were--
mr.
scott
daniel
--no.
the
amnesia
i
referred
to
because
it
precluded
us,
if,
in
fact,
he
was
there...
you
know
that
is
still
an
issue,
at
least
in
my
mind,
irrespective
of
how
the
jury
resolved
that.
but,
that
he
could
not
out
of
his
own
mouth
testify
to
something
he
had
no
recollection
of.
mr.
scott
daniel
they
said
that
he
lacked
the
capacity
to
conform
his
conduct
to
the
requirements
of
the
law.
mr.
scott
daniel
if
your
honor
please,
under
the
terms
of
tennessee
definition
of
insanity,
and
petitioner
conceded
this
in
their
brief,
that
we
presented
what
would
have
been
a
valid
insanity
defense
under
the
tennessee
law.
mr.
scott
daniel
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
he
had
the
ability
to...
malice
requires
intent.
mr.
scott
daniel
and,
it
requires
the
ability
to
formulate
and
carry
out
an
intent.
mr.
scott
daniel
i
am
arguing
that
he
did
not
intend--
mr.
scott
daniel
--well--
mr.
scott
daniel
--what
they
said
was
that
he...
as
i
pointed
out
before,
that
he
was
incapable
of,
in
their
opinion--
mr.
scott
daniel
--of
conforming.
and,
as
i
presented
and
as
i
think
we
presented
it
to
the
jury
in
the
fashion
that
his
conduct
was
such
that
it
could
not
be
voluntary
and
that
is
the
essence
of
that
defense,
and
we
used
it
straight
out
of
the
tennessee
requirements
so
that
he
had
to
give
his
opinion
exactly
as
the
tennessee
law
requires
on
that.
and
that
the
tennessee
courts
have
interpreted
as
going
for
voluntary,
saying
it
cannot
be
voluntary
unless
it
is
a
produce
of
the
free
will.
if
he
cannot
control
it,
he
did
not
have
the
intent
and
cannot
conform
his
conduct.
it
is
the
determination
that
he
didn't
have
the
intent
necessary
for
malice.
mr.
scott
daniel
i
apologize
for
getting
off
on
that.
mr.
scott
daniel
i
respectfully
agree
with
your
honor.
i
was
simply
trying
to
respond
to
a
matter
that
they
raised
there.
what
we
suggest
to
the
court
and
what
we
submit
and
argue
in
this
case
is
that
the
jury
here
clearly
had
before
it
a
contested
issue;
that
is
there
was
a
contested
issue
we
contested
all
the
way
through.
that
is
that
there
was
fighting
going
on.
we
contested
whether
or
not
there
was
malice
from
day
one,
from
the
opening
shot
and
the
opening
statement.
we
claimed
and
attempted
to
show
through
every
means
possible
that
there
were
other
explanations,
there
were
fights
or
there
was
provocation,
principally
that
there
was
no
evidence
as
to
what,
in
fact,
had
happened
or
how
it
happened.
it
was
credible.
and,
that
the
jury
instructions
on
the
issue
itself
went
to
and
said
that
you
are
to
presume
intent,
you
are
to
presume
malice
and
malice
it
defined
as
intent.
they
said
this
is
presumed
unless
rebutted.
that
here
we
had
a
defendant
that
was
incapable
of
even
recollecting
the
events,
assuming
he
was
there,
could
not
present
any
evidence
contrary
to
this.
this
undercut
our
entire
case.
it
told
the
jury
before
it
could
to
any
of
the
other
issues
that
malice
was
presumed
unless
rebutted.
mr.
scott
daniel
no,
there
was
no
evidence
to
that.
mr.
scott
daniel
the
psychiatrist,
as
i
recall
it,
in
essence
said
that
he
had
no...
he
said
he
would
never
have
done
anything
like
that
and
had
no
recollection
of
ever
having
threatened
or
having
done
anything
that
would
harm.
and,
indeed,
the
lay
witnesses
themselves
said,
that
although
he
made
some
threats
at
times
he
also
on
other
occasions
said
i
would
never
do
anything
to
her,
i
would
never
hurt
her,
anything
of
this
nature.
so,
the
psychiatric
testimony
did
not
anywhere
state
in
any
way,
shape
or
form
that
he
ever
threatened
or
claimed
to
have
harbored
any
intent
to
harm
her.
mr.
scott
daniel
do
you
mean
the
evidence
in
the
sense
that
we
were--
mr.
scott
daniel
--oh,
no.
your
honor,
please,
if
the
insanity
defense
were
not
there,
our
claim
would
be
identical.
we
would
not
be
changing
the
argument
i
am
making
right
now.
mr.
scott
daniel
don't
have
to
rely
on
insanity.
that
is
in
addition
to
the
other
defense,
because...
this
is
what
i
was
going
into
to
begin
with...
the
facts...
first
of
all,
i
don't
agree
with
their
statement
of
the
facts,
they
are
reaching
conclusions,
but,
nevertheless,
the
issue
of
intent
is
one
which
to
be
submitted
to
the
jury
where
we
contest
that
issue.
in
essence,
by
the
ruling
of
the
court,
constituted
a
directed
verdict
on
that
particular
issue
of
intent,
whereas,
we
were
contesting
it.
we
are
entitled
to
the
presumption
of
innocence.
if
we
didn't
have
the
other
evidence,
statements,
that
there
was
a
fight,
of
a
gun
in
the
pocket
of
a
man
with
a
bullet
in
the
chamber,
whether
or
not
it
had
been
fired
five
minutes
before
or
an
hour
before
or
could
have,
you
know,
all
these
types
of
things.
there
was
absolutely
nothing
that
the
jury
was
required
to
accept
that
would
have
required
them
to
reach
the
conclusion
without
this
presumption
that
malice
was
intended.
malice
must
go
to
the
second
degree
as
well
as
the
first
degree
offense.
now,
the
tennessee
supreme
court
in
the
recent
case
of
state
against
martin,
which
i
attached
a
copy
to
my
brief
in
this
court,
came
out
with
a
decision
in
which
in
essence
it
has
now
acknowledged
the
erroneous
presumption
here.
it
reversed
a
murder
case
in
that
one
on
its
own
initiative
even
though
the
error
wasn't
raised
because
it
was
a
death
penalty
case.
but,
in
that
case,
they
have
now
conceded
that
even
though
premeditation
is
found
specifically,
that
premeditation
was
clearly
proved
in
the
martin
case,
but
that
this
was
not
sufficient
to
dictate
a
finding
of
malice
and
it
reversed
on
the
issue
of
malice
while
finding
premeditation
was
fully
established
even
though
there
were
substantial
eye-witnesses
to
it,
because
it
held
that
malice
is
a
separate
issue
and
that
malice
in
order
to
be
found
cannot
be
presumed
under
its
view
of
the
law
now
and
that
since
it
cannot
be
presumed
it
found
that
this
was
a
separate
issue
which
must
be
tried
by
the
jury
upon
proper
instructions
irrespective
of
whether
the
evidence
with
regard
to
premeditation
was
clearly
sufficient
and
that
is
what
it
found.
so,
we
submit
to
the
court
that
the
tennessee
court,
even
now
by
its
own
findings,
by
its
own
determination,
has
reached
the
position
that
we
have
taken
throughout.
it
has
taken
perhaps
five
years
to
get
there
because
of
various
different
evolutions
of
the
case,
i
guess,
but
now
we
submit
that
their
decision
in
that
case
is
controlling
here
as
to
the
tennessee
law
aspects
of
the
case.
mr.
scott
daniel
i
say
it
contains
sufficient
evidence
of
malice
just
as
in
the
case--
mr.
scott
daniel
--well,
first
of
all,
the
pursing.
there
was
no
showing
that
there
was
pursuing
in
any
fashion
other
than
just
simply
driving
behind
him.
there
wasn't
any
chase
at
that
time.
the
police
officer
who
was
behind
them
saw
them
and
didn't
see
any
conduct
wrongful
there.
mr.
scott
daniel
we
don't
have
any
proof
of
that
that
is
credible
proof.
mr.
scott
daniel
well,
if
you
feel
that
you
are
required
to
accept
the
state's
testimony
of
a
little
girl
who
was
the
only
eye-witness,
who
the
judge
said
was
impeached,
and
who
admitted
that
she
had
been
told
by
her
father
what
to
say
at
the
trial...
her
father
being
the
other
man
we
suggested
who
possibly
could
have
committed
the
offense...
then
you
can
draw
certain
conclusions.
but,
her
testimony
was
wholly
incredible.
mr.
scott
daniel
no,
if
your
honor
please,
you
asked
me
that
question
earlier,
i
believe,
and
my
response,
as
i
understand
it,
was
that
it
was
not
overwhelming.
that
is
the
position
we
have
taken
specifically
in
our
brief,
it
was
not
overwhelming,
that
it
was
sufficient.
if
the
question
was
simply
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
to
establish
the
fact,
i
wouldn't
argue
that.
but,
to
say
that
it
is
overwhelming
so
that
it
dictates
that
conclusion,
i
respectfully
submit--
mr.
scott
daniel
--well,
if
your
honor
please,
we
contended
throughout
the
case
that,
number
one...
our
defense
was
this:
number
one,
that
we
do
not
believe
he
committed
the
offense.
he
said
i
would
not
have
any
reason
to
do
it,
i
loved
her,
i
wouldn't
have
done
it.
number
two,
if,
in
fact,
he
committed
the
offense,
he
did
so
as
a
result
of
mental
illness
over
which
he
had
no
voluntary
control
and
over
which
his
will
had
no...
he
was
unable
to
formulate
the
intent
and
had
no
ability
to
conform
his
conduct,
and,
likewise,
he
did
not
have
the
intent,
malicious
intent,
irrespective
of
the
mental
element;
that
it
arose
out
of
a
fight,
a
provocation
or
a
heat
of
passion
type
of
thing
which
would
reduce
it
to
manslaughter.
and,
this
is
what
our
position
was.
if
we
were
to
go
back
and
again
try
the
case
tomorrow,
i
can't
concede
that
my
man
committed
something
he
says
i
don't
remember
doing
and
wouldn't
have
done,
i
loved
her.
so,
i
am
in
the
position
of
having
to
argue
these
things
without
a
client
who
can
testify
as
to
what
occurred,
assuming
he
was
there
without
conceding
he
was
there.
mr.
scott
daniel
that
is
his--
mr.
scott
daniel
--no,
judge...
excuse
me,
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
am
sure
he
didn't
love
the
man
and
i
wouldn't
say
that.
i
am
simply
saying
as
it
respects
the
female
victim
in
the
case,
his
position
throughout
and
through
all
the
psychiatric
was
that
he
loved
her
and
he
couldn't
conceive
of
ever
having
had
any
reason
or--
mr.
scott
daniel
--no,
no,
he
didn't.
he
couldn't.
he
wasn't
there
or
didn't
recall
any
facts
about
the
incident
and
had
no
way
to
present
any
evidence
as
to
what
actually
did
occur.
there
simply
was
no
thread
of
direct
evidence
as
to
what
happened
in
this
case.
it
is
simply
a
case
of
circumstantial
evidence
in
which
the
only
witness
who
allegedly
present
was
admittedly
impeached
according
to
the
trial
judge
and
testified
as
we
mentioned
before.
i
further
submit
this
and
this
is
a
point
i
think
is
necessary
here,
the
only
issued
that
was
raised
here
is
the
harmless
error,
whether
or
not
the
evidence
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
both
the
district
judge
and
the
sixth
circuit
panels,
who
presumably
are
reasonable
and
competent,
experienced
jurists,
agreed
with
the
position
we
have
taken
here
with
regard
to
the
effect
of
this
error
and
their
ruling
in
this
case
related
to
a
thorough
consideration
of
the
factual
aspects
as
the
trial
judge
went
at
some
length
to
detail
and
point
out.
i
am
not
just
coming
out
of
left
field.
this
is
a
matter
that
the
jurists
who
have
considered
this
matter
before
on
this
particular
issue
particularly
went
into
and
evaluated.
now,
they
did
so
under
the
harmless
error
doctrine.
they
applied
the
chapman
rule
of
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
since
that
has
already
been
applied
here,
i
respectfully
submit
there
is
no
reason
for
this
court
to
determine
what
other
type
of
harmless
error
rule
could
apply
in
some
other
case
under
different
facts
and
hypothetical
circumstances.
we
submit
that
the
federal
courts
below
have
evaluated
the
error
based
upon
the
chapman
rule,
have
reached
the
logical,
proper
conclusions
under
that
that
rule
and
that
should
dictate
the
holding
of
this
court
in
this
case
because
of
the
fact
that
they
have
made
their
ruling
and
the
fact
that
they
considered
the
issues
presented
to
them
in
this
case.
we
further--
mr.
scott
daniel
--no,
they
follow
a
harmless
error
rule.
mr.
scott
daniel
basically
it
is
the
chapman
test,
your
honor.
mr.
scott
daniel
generally,
i
would
say
so,
your
honor.
they
have
not
reversed
simply
because
of
an
inconsistent
verdict.
they
have
held
verdicts
that
were
inconsistent
in
several
different
types
of
cases.
mr.
scott
daniel
the
weapon
that
was
used
in--
mr.
scott
daniel
--it
was
recovered,
yes,
your
honor.
it
was
introduced.
it
was
recovered
under
unusual
circumstances.
again,
it
was
found
some
three
weeks
after
the
event
and
was
introduced
as
being
the
weapon
that
was
alleged
to
have--
mr.
scott
daniel
--no,
there
were
no
fingerprints
on
it.
it
had
been
out
in
the
weather
and
they
claimed
there
was
no
way
to
obtain
fingerprints
at
that
time.
furthermore,
nobody
saw
it
being
disposed
of
and
when
they
talked
about
a
high-speed
chase
and
so
forth,
that
again
is
contested
and
there
wasn't
really
any--
mr.
scott
daniel
--yes,
testimony
did
show
that
it
was
mr.
terry
hill's
pistol
and
it
was
the
same
one
he
had
borrowed
earlier.
there
were
some
other
aspects
of
that
which
i
have
gone
into
at
length
in
the
brief
and
i
won't
go
into
all
of
that,
but
at
any
rate
that
much
it
was.
that
is
correct.
it
was,
according
to
the
testimony,
loaned
to
my
client.
we,
again,
submit
that
the
controlling
rule
here
is
the
fact
that
we
have
right
to
rely
upon
the
presumption
of
innocence
and
that
the
court
cannot,
in
keeping
with
the
process
and
justices
that
have
been
followed
by
this
court
throughout,
say
that
in
essence
directing
a
verdict
on
an
issue
that
is
contested
in
a
case
and
where
they
defendant
cannot,
due
to
his
mental
condition,
is
unable
to,
assuming
he
even
was
there,
testify,
present
evidence,
rule
that
he
was
obligated
to
rebut
this
type
of
evidence
as
the
instruction
would
require
him
to
do
and
it
was
denied
the
presumption
of
innocence.
the
presumption
of
innocence,
if
we
had
had
that
alone...
simply
go
into
court
and
say
we
want
to
rely
on
a
presumption
of
innocence,
that
that
presumption
alone
should
have
been
enough
to
allow
us
to
make
the
jury
confront
the
issues
head
on
without
a
presumption
telling
them
what
they
are
supposed
to
do
unless
we
rebut
it.
and,
that
really
gets
down
to
the
crux
of
the
matter.
although
we
think
we
have
a
much
stronger
say
as
the
trial...
district
judge
and
the
other
judges
in
the
sixth
circuit
pointed
out,
we
nevertheless
submit
that
to
adopt
the
position
taken
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
simply
do
away
with
the
presumption
of
innocence
in
a
case
where
there
was
strong
evidence
and
allow
the
court
simply
to
take
a
position
that,
well,
all
right,
we
don't
think
there
is
enough
evidence
and
there
is
strong
evidence
on
this,
it
really
makes
no
difference
to
us
whether
or
not
this
issue...
the
jury
was
allowed
to
fairly
consider
this
issue
without
placing
the
burden
to
rebut
it
on
the
other
side.
and,
under
this
posture,
we
just
don't
think
that
the
position
taken
by
the
solicitor
general
or
by
the
petitioner
in
general
can
be
a
proper
position
to
be
adopted.
finally,
in
closing,
i
will
simply
state
that
we
submit
that
that
is
one
issue
that
this
court
doesn't
need
to
reach.
that
it
simply
is
a
matter
that
that
issue
has
already
been
properly
and
fairly
decided
by
the
district
court
and
the
sixth
circuit
and
that
the
presumption
that
clearly
was
erroneous
and
clearly
prejudicial
to
each
of
the
defenses,
which
we
attempted
and
feel
like
we
did
present
at
length
at
the
trial.
