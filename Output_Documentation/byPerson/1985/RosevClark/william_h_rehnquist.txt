justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
daniel,
you
spoke
a
moment
ago
of
the
psychiatric
testimony
supporting
your
client's
amnesia
defense.
i
wouldn't
think
there
is
anything
inconsistent
about
saying
that
if
he
was
there
he
has
totally
forgotten
or
has
no
recollection
and
still,
if
he
was
there,
he
might
have
had
the
malice
required
for
first
degree
murder.
do
you
see
anything
inconsistent
between
that
sort
of
amnesia
you
are
talking
about
and
the
intent
to
kill?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
wouldn't
be
amnesia,
that
would
be--
