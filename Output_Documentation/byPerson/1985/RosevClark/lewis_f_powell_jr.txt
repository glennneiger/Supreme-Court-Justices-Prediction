justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--mr.
daniel,
did
any
psychiatrist
say
that
your
client
lacked
the
capacity
to
have
malice?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
is
right.
does
that
have
anything
to
do
with
malice?
there
are
plenty
of
people
who
know
exactly
what
they
are
doing,
but
they
are
just
unable
to
conform
to
law.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
malice?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
are
you
arguing
that
he
did
not
intend
to
kill?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
then
i
come
back
to
my
original
question.
can
you
cite
me
anything
the
psychiatrist
said
that
he
lacked
malice?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
he
was
incapable
of
possessing
malice?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
of
conforming
to
the
law.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
presumption,
of
course,
was
rebuttable.
let's
assume
that
you
had
no
psychiatric
evidence
whatever.
do
you
think
the
evidence
in
this
case
would
have
rebutted
the
presumption
of
malice?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
had
no
psychiatric
evidence
to
enable
you
to
argue
insanity.
that
would
leave
you
with
all
the
facts
that
were
outlined
by
your
opponent
in
this
case.
he
had
threatened
to
kill
his
former
girlfriend
five
or
six
times,
he
followed
her
car
down
the
road,
he
fired
three
shots
into
her
at
close
range.
in
spite
of
those
facts,
are
you
suggesting
that
unless
you
had
had
the
defense
of
insanity
that
the
evidence
did
not
rebut
successfully
your
position?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
you
don't
have
to
rely
on
insanity?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
did
not
the
testimony
show
that
the
pistol
was
the
same
one
borrowed
from
his
friend?
