mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
has
often
recognized
the
harmless
error
doctrine
serves
salutary
purposes
in
the
criminal
process.
it
is
also
clear
from
the
court's
decisions
that
an
erroneous
jury
instruction
may
generally
be
analyzed
for
its
harmlessness
in
the
particular
facts
of
a
given
case.
the
question
here
is
whether
the
court
ought
to
create
an
exception
from
those
rules
for
instructions
that
have
an
erroneous
presumption.
in
this
case,
the
presumption
is
rebuttable,
but
the
court
has
looked
at
both
rebuttal
and
conclusive
presumptions
in
the
cases
preceding
this
one
such
as
sandstrom
and
connecticut
versus
johnson.
it
is
our
position
there
is
no
reason
to
adopt
the
per
se
rule
in
this
area.
and,
it
is
also
our
position
that
the
analysis
that
the
court
followed
in
united
states
versus
frady
directly
controls
this
case.
the
question
in
frady
came
up
in
the
context
of
whether
or
not
the
defendant
had
been
prejudiced
because
he
hadn't
objected
at
trial
to
the
instruction.
but,
the
question
of
whether
the
defendant
is
prejudiced
is
simply
the
flip
side
of
the
question
of
whether
the
error
is
harmless.
so,
the
analysis
the
court
followed
in
frady
should
apply
here.
two
aspects
of
the
decision
in
frady
are
quite
important.
first,
the
court
found
no
difficulty
in
analyzing
the
record
to
decide
whether
or
not
frady,
in
fact,
had
been
prejudiced.
and,
second,
the
court
found
that
for
three
related
reasons
he
was
not.
the
first
was
that
the
government's
proof
in
that
case
of
malice
was
overwhelming.
that
is
also
the
case
here.
the
second
reason
was
the
erroneous
instruction
did
not
affect
the
defense
in
that
case
of
non-participation
that
frady
had
raised.
neither
the
defense
of
non-participation,
voluntarily
intoxication,
insanity
or
amnesia
could
have
been
affected
by
this
instruction.
and,
finally,
the
last
reason
given
in
frady
why
the
error
there
was
not
prejudicial
was
that
the
jury
found
that
frady
had
premeditated
and
deliberated
and
that,
too,
is
the
case
here.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that
i
don't
know,
your
honor,
but
i
can
say
the
court
clearly--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--clearly,
for
that
reason
at
least,
it
hasn't
been
overruled.
the
question
analyzing
frady
was
whether
the
erroneous
instruction
had
affected
the
verdict
in
that
case.
the
court
was
able
to
find
that
it
did
not.
the
court
gave
a
variety
of
different
reasons
for
it.
those
are
the
same
types
of
reasons
that
should
apply
in
a
case
such
as
this
one.
now,
as
frady
demonstrates,
the
error
that
occurs
in
a
case
like
this
with
an
erroneous
instruction
of
this
type,
is
not
a
fundamental
defect
in
the
trial
process
that
completely
deprives
someone
of
a
semblance
of
a
trial.
the
instructions
given
in
this
case
have
been
used
in
tennessee
murder
prosecutions
since
the
time
of
andrew
jackson.
they
were
used
elsewhere
nationwide,
both
in
state
and
federal
cases,
for
some
time
thereafter,
and
this
court
had
even
approved
a
similar
type
of
instruction
in
the
allen
case.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
not
necessarily.
the
rationale
that
we
understand
the
court
to
have
adopted
in
sandstrom
is
that
there
is
a
risk
that
the
jury
may
misconstrue
these
types
of
instructions.
but,
that
doesn't
mean
that
they
are
necessarily
to
be
equated
with
a
directed
verdict.
instructions
like
this
take
place
along
a
continuum.
at
one
end
of
the
continuum
is
an
instruction
that
allows
a
jury
to
infer
an
ultimate
fact
from
a
basic
fact.
the
court
has
never
found
any
constitutional
problem
with
that
type
of
instruction
so
long
as
the
evidence
is
sufficient
to
support
it
and
so
long
as
the
type
of
inference
the
jury
is
allowed
to
draw
is
one
that
is
entirely
rational.
at
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
is
a
case
where
you
have
an
actual
directed
verdict,
either
in
whole
as
where
the
case
is
not
allowed
to
go
to
the
jury
at
all,
or
in
part
where
the
case
is
allowed
to
go
to
the
jury
on
one
or
more
issues.
the
problem
with
an
instruction
like
the
type
that
was
found
in
sandstrom
is
not
that
it
necessarily
amounts
to
a
directed
verdict,
it
is
just
that
there
is
some
risk
that
the
jury
may
misconstrue
how
it
should
be
applied.
but,
where
the
evidence
is
overwhelming,
it
seems
to
us
quite
unlikely
that
the
jury
is
not
going
to
be
swayed
by
that
type
of
evidence.
if
it
is
a
problem
of
uncertainty,
certainly
isn't
present
where
there
are
other
findings
by
the
jury
that
are
untainted
by
the
error.
for
example,
in
frady,
there
was
a
finding
of
premeditation
and
deliberation.
that
is
also
the
case
here.
the
erroneous
presumption
in
this
case
affected
only
the
instruction
on
malice,
not
the
instructions
on
willfulness
premeditation
and
deliberation.
the
additional
findings
the
jury
made
in
this
case,
therefore,
show
that
they
necessarily
found
malice
regardless
of
whether
or
not
the
error
was
brought
to
their
attention
or
otherwise.
secondly,
it
is
also
not
the
type
of
error
where
an
inquiry
is
inherently
impractical.
this
court
was
able
to
make
that
type
of
inquiry
in
frady
and
the
lower
courts,
both
state
and
federal,
have
found
that
they
are
able
to
distinguish
cases
where
there
are
erroneous
presumptions,
conclusive
or
rebuttable.
they
are
able
to
distinguish
the
cases
where
they
are
harmless
from
the
cases
where
they
are
prejudicial.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
i
would
explain
that
the
same
way
the
trial
judge
explained
it
here.
page
132
in
the
record
contains
the
trial
judge's
order
denying
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
making
sentences
consecutive.
there
he
said
he
found
that
there
were
two
cold-blooded
killings,
one
premeditated
and
the
other
flowing
out
of
the
first.
it
seems
to
me
what
happened
here
in
this
case
was
the
jury
thought
that
the
killing
of
faulk
was
premeditated,
probably
largely
because
there
had
been
numerous
threats
made
by
the
respondent
that
he
would
kill
her
if
he
found
her
with
another
man
and
also
because
she
was
shot
multiple
times
and
browning
was
shot
only
once.
now,
the
evidence
would
be
sufficient
to
support
premeditation
and
deliberation
as
to
both,
but
what
probably
accounts
for
what
happened
here
is
just
that
the
jury
thought
premeditation
and
deliberation
probably
requires
thinking
about
it
for
a
long
time.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
there
was
no
basis
in
the
other
jury
instructions
for
allowing
them
to
reduce
the
second
degree
murder
verdict
to
manslaughter
which
require
provocation
and
passion.
as
the
attorney
general
discussed,
browning
was
found
in
the
car.
his
foot
was
on
the
brake
pedal,
his
gun
was
in
his
pocket.
it
hadn't
just
been
fired
where
the
empty
cylinder
was
located
showed
that.
he
was
shot
once
through
the
head
instantaneously.
it
is
clear
that
there
was
no
evidence
presented
to
support
the
claim
that
there
was
a
manslaughter
or
self-defense
theory.
the
only
evidence
of
any
type
that
the
respondent
offered
in
this
respect
was
a
statement
that
mitzi
faulk,
six-year
old
daughter
of
joy
faulk,
had
made,
to
the
two
people
who
picked
her
up
that
night
after
the
killing,
in
which
she
said
they
were
fighting,
clicker
and
browning
had
guns
and
they
were
fighting.
on
the
stand,
mitzi
denied
that
there
was
any
type
of
fight
there.
so,
the
only
evidence
he
has
that
would
justify
anything
less
than
a
second
degree
murder
conviction
was
this
one
particular
type
of
hearsay
statement.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that
was
his
primary
defense
at
trial,
yes,
your
honor.
of
course,
the
alibi
he
tried
to
present
was
weakened
by
the
fact
that
neither
he
nor
anyone
else
were
able
to
pinpoint
where
he
was,
and
that
is
because
he
said
he
had
amnesia
at
the
time.
also,
the
two
people
who
were
supposed
to
have
committed
this
crime,
joy
faulk's
ex-husband,
sam,
and
charles
browning's
wife,
were
both
seen
by
several
witnesses
at
a
bar
for
the
entire
evening.
so,
even
his
alibi
defense
was
quite
weak.
but,
in
any
event,
if
that
type
of
defense
is
raised,
as
it
was
raised
in
frady,
it
is
clear
that
erroneous
instruction
on
malice
doesn't
affect
the
question
of
who
did
the
killing.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
yes.
that
would
even
be
a
stronger
case.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
the
evidence
clearly--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--the
jury
didn't
agree
as
to
browning.
they
clearly
did
agree
as
to
faulk.
we
think
the
reason
looked
at
in
a
common-sense
fashion,
which
is
the
way
the
jury
probably
looked
at
the
evidence,
is
just
that
there
were
threats
made
against
the
life
of
joy
faulk
before
the
time
the
killings
took
place.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
the
evidence
in
this
respect
as
to
the
threats--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--yes,
he
did.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
and,
the
gun
was
not
out
of
his
pocket.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
and
the
gun
had
not
just
been
fired.
so,
when
all
the
evidence
is
considered
as
a
whole,
we
think
that
the
defenses
of--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--thank
you.
