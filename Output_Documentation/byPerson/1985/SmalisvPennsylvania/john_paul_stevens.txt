justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
before
you...
i'm
not
clear.
what
happens
if
the
same
judge
is
not
available
when
you
come
back
after
a
couple
of
years?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
maybe
i'm
not
remembering
the
facts.
if
it
were
a
jury
trial
and
you
had
to
send
it
back
and
start
over
again,
what
would
he
do?
he'd
put
in
the
same
evidence
again,
is
that
what
he'd
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
can't
be
sure
the
witnesses
will
testify
in
exactly...
the
evidence
won't
be
exactly
the
same
as
it
was
the
first
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
fact,
it--
--some
could
be
dead.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
question.
you
say
the
misdemeanor
charges
remain
undisposed
of,
but
that
the
charges
on
the
unrelated
arson
went
forward
and
the
man
was
convicted.
why
would
they
go
forward
with
some
charges
and
not
others
that
were
not
covered
by
the
demurrer
that
was
sustained?
i
don't
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
even
if
they...
the
misdemeanor
charges
were
not
covered
by
the
demurrer
either,
though,
were
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see,
but
if
they
are
lesser
included
offenses,
then
if
your
opponent
wins
on
the
demurrer,
those
would
as
well...
at
least
arguably
would
also
be
barred?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
position,
as
i
understand
it,
on
the
charges
that
were
covered
by
the
demurrer,
is
that,
we
don't
yet
know
if
that
was
an
acquittal.
if
the
trial
judge
turns
out
to
be
right
it
was
an
acquittal.
if
he's
wrong
it's
not
an
acquittal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
not
true,
is
it?
say,
the
decision
is
right
but
the
prosecutor
doesn't
think
it's
right,
therefore
appeals--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so
that
the
defendant
at
least
has
the
burden
of
resisting
an
appeal
that
he
would
not
otherwise
have
to
resist?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
frey,
how
do
you
distinguish
a
case
in
which
a
defendant
objects
to
a
whole
category
of
evidence,
he
urges
the
court
to
keep
it
out
and
the
judge
erroneously
excludes
all
the
evidence,
and
then
the
jury
returns
a
verdict
of
not
guilty.
it's
based
on
legal
error
and
it's
the
defendant's
fault
for
having
made
what
turns
out
to
be
an
improper
motion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not?
what's
the
difference?
still,
why
wouldn't
the
defendant
have
waived
his
right
by
making
a
motion
that
caused
the
court
to--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
seems
to
me
its
a
logical
extension
of
the
argument
you
are
making.
