justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
chase,
in
pennsylvania
do
you
have
to
demur
to
the
evidence
at
the
close
of
the
prosecution's
case
in
order
to
later
make
a
motion
for
judgment
n.o.b.
if
the
jury
convicts
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
i
was
wondering,
if
the
defendants
were
so
anxious
to
have
the
trial
completed,
they
could
have
foregone
the
demurrer
to
the
evidence.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
chase,
you
say
that
you
think
burks
supports,
in
your
position,
that
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
trial
judge
to
admit
a
credibility
determination
in
order
for
double
jeopardy
to
apply,
but
didn't
burks
amount
to
a
conclusion
that
there
was
just
not
sufficient
evidence
to
support
a
judgment
of
guilty?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
one
might
wonder
how
much
in
the
practical
world
this
sort
of
situation
is
going
to
arise,
because
it's
hard
to
believe
that
the
state
is
going
to
profit
much
by
appealing
from
the
sort
of
judgment
you
describe
and
get
it
reversal,
only
to
come
back
and
find
he
judge
is
the
fact
finder
and
he
will
surely
feel,
as
a
fact
finder
he
will
feel
just
as
he
did
about
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
and,
in
the
jury
case,
the
thing
just
isn't
going
to
arise.
you
don't
disband
the
jury
and
bring
it
back
two
years
later.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
suggestion,
mr.
eberhardt,
is
that
when
you're
talking
about
a
motion
like
this,
the
trial
court
may
have
a
misunderstanding
as
to
what
elements
are
necessary
for
the
crime,
so
that
it's
quite
different
from
a
credibility
determination?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
won't
it
be
exactly
that
question
that
is
pending
before
the
superior
court
of
pennsylvania,
if
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
is
affirmed
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
if
the
superior
court
decides
in
the
defendant's
favor
but
affirms
the
court
of
common
pleas,
is
that
then
the
case
is
all
over.
if
it
reverses
and
says
the
trial
judge
was
wrong
in
his
understanding
of
the
law,
the
case
would
go
back?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let's
get
back
just
a
minute,
mr.
frey,
to
your
example
about
circumstantial
evidence.
you
say
that
could
be
reviewable.
could
it
be
reviewed
by
the
pennsylvania
superior
court,
in
this
case,
because
the
pennsylvania
rule
was
that
you
could
convict
on
circumstantial
evidence?
could
it
be
reviewed
by
the
pennsylvania
superior
court
saying,
this
was
enough
circumstantial
evidence
to
go
to
the
jury?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
you
make
a
motion
for
judgment
n.o.b.
under
the
federal
rules
if
you
haven't
made
a
rule
29
motion
at
the
close
of
the
evidence
of
the
government?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
otherwise,
the
statement
you
just
made
may
not
be
correct.
if
you
have
to
make
a
rule
29
motion
in
order
to
preserve
your
rights
for
post-verdict
motion--
