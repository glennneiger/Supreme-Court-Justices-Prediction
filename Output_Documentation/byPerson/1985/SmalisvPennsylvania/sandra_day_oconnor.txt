justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--mr.
frey,
it
seems
to
me
that
your
argument
goes
beyond
that,
what
the
state
of
pennsylvania...
it
seemed
to
me
the
state
of
pennsylvania
was
conceding
that
if
the
trial
court
had
applied
the
correct
standard
in
determining
the
evidence
was
insufficient,
that
that
would
constitute
an
acquittal
for
purposes
of
double
jeopardy.
and
yet,
you,
i
think,
are
arguing
a
broader
rule,
that
any
finding
of
insufficient
evidence
just
falls
outside
double
jeopardy?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that's
the
same
thing
that
the
attorney
for
the
state
of
pennsylvania
is
arguing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
aren't
there
some
states
that
have
such
a
rule?
