mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
matter
before
the
court
raises
an
important
question
relating
to
the
proper
role
of
the
pennsylvania
trial
judge
in
deciding
whether
a
criminal
case
shall
proceed
to
verdict.
in
the
commonwealth's
view,
the
trial
judge
in
this
case
was
not
asked
to
sit
in
judgment,
but
rather
was
requested
to
determine
that
judgment
could
not
be
entered
at
all
in
this
case.
the
motion
made
below
by
the
respondents
was
reflective
of
pennsylvania's
desire
for
specificity
and
particularity
when
raising
claims
of
sufficiency
of
the
evidence,
in
the
context
of
the
legal
standard
to
be
applied
in
evaluating
the
evidence.
clearly,
a
trial
judge
has
a
separate
function
in
determining
whether
or
not
there
is
sufficiency
of
evidence
factually
to
determine
guilt,
as
opposed
to
determining
whether
or
not
the
law
requires
that
the
judgment
be
sought
in
a
particular
case.
the
commonwealth
is
very
aware
of
this
court's
discussion
with
regard
to
the
talismanic
nature
of
particular
words,
and
the
commonwealth
doesn't
want
to
rely
on
the
word
"demurrer"
as
providing
any
special
significance
in
and
of
itself.
however,
the
term
"demurrer"
is
reflective
of
pennsylvania's
desire
that
was
set
forth
in
the
case
of
martin
linen
supply,
that
the
federal
system
did
not
provide,
that
is,
a
restriction
on
the
power
of
the
trial
judge
to
rule
in
midtrial,
requests
regarding
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
as
a
matter
of
law.
now,
the
question
that
has
arisen
with
regard
to
what
difference
would
occur
before
this
trial
judge
on
remand,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
there
is
a
different
mental
process
that
the
court
would
go
through
in
determining
whether,
specifically
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
commonwealth
prosecutor
has
established
a
case
within
the
framework
of
the
definition
of
the
crime
as
opposed
to
whether
or
not
the
commonwealth,
the
prosecutor,
has
established
sufficient
evidence
to
convince
a
finder
of
fact
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
the
crime,
that
the
crime
has
been
committed.
there
is
a
different
mental
process
that
i
suggest
is
important
to
reflect
and
to
be
recognized
in
a
system
such
as
pennsylvania's.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
right.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
that's
the
particular
request
that's
made
of
the
judge
at
that
point
in
time.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
right.
the
court
is
saying
that,
"with
my
understanding
of
the
law
and
the
legal
definition
of
the
crime,
the
evidence
that
you
have
presented
does
not
support
sufficiently
the
elements
of
the
offense
established
by
the
legislative
definition.
"
so,
whether
we're
talking
about
a
jury
trial
or
non-jury
trial
with
regard
to
the
demurrer,
the
same
standard
is
being
requested
of
the
court.
however,
pennsylvania
goes
on
in
its
rules
to
recognize
that
at
a
later
stage
after
all
the
evidence
has
been
introduced
in
the
particular
matter,
that
the
trial
judge
is
being
asked
to
decide
a
different
question.
the
judge
is
being
asked
in
a
non-jury
situation
for
the
equivalent
of
a
verdict.
now,
this
court
has
recognized
that
double
jeopardy
problems
arise
whenever
there
is
a
not
guilty
verdict
entered
by
a
jury.
clearly,
that
is
the
classic
situation
where
there
is
an
application
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
what
the
commonwealth
is
suggesting
is
that
the
pennsylvania
procedure
here
is
not
providing,
at
this
stage
in
the
trial,
through
demurrer,
the
equivalent
of
a
not
guilty
verdict
by
a
jury.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
well,
we
never
got
to
argue
the
merits
of
the
case
below,
your
honor.
the
particular
appeal
that
was
taken
in
superior
court,
and
the
delays
occasioned
in
this
appellate
process,
were
raised
as
a
result
of
the
appealability
question.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
we
had
no
opportunity
beyond
presenting
it
in
a
written
brief,
what
the
commonwealth's
argument
was
with
regard
to
the--
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
--no,
on
appeal
to
the
superior
court
of
pennsylvania.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
well,
in
this
particular
case
the
commonwealth
rested,
and
demurrers
were
tendered
by
defense
counsel
as
to
all
the
charges
before
the
court.
the
court
granted
certain
ones
and
denied
others.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
that
was
argued
before
the
lower
court.
the
commonwealth
found
a
motion
for
reconsideration
which
is
permitted
under
pennsylvania
practice,
that
a
trial
court
can
reconsider
any
ruling
within
30
days.
the
court
entertained
that
motion
for
reconsideration.
in
fact,
defense
counsel
requested
that
the
court
reconsider
all
its
rulings
with
regard
to
the
demurrer.
following
the
court's
decision,
the
commonwealth
then
filed
an
appeal
to
the
superior
court
of
pennsylvania.
following
that
appeal
a
motion
was
made
to
quash
the
appeal.
the
motion
was
reserved
for
argument
on
the
merits
of
the
appeal.
following
arguments
on
the
merits,
a
panel
of
the
superior
court
of
pennsylvania
quashed
the
appeal.
then
the
superior
court
of
pennsylvania
granted
re-argument
of
that
question
and
we
argued
again
the
appealability
issue
before
the
superior
court
en
banc.
at
no
time
has
a
court
beyond
the
trial
court
reviewed
as
yet
the
question
of
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
it's
quite
different
from
a
credibility
determination.
what
we're
suggesting
is,
the
court
in
measuring
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
as
a
framework
within
which
it
is
operating,
if
that
framework
is
improper
or
is
too
extensive
in
light
of
the
commonwealth's
proffer
of
evidence,
then
the
court
has
made
an
error
of
law
that
it
uses
to
resolve
the
question
of
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
the
court
is
being
asked,
classically
at
common
law
under
a
demurrer,
and
under
pennsylvania
practice,
to
make
a
legal
measurement
of
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
against
a
framework.
if
the
commonwealth
cannot
argue
on
appeal
that
the
court
used
the
improper
framework
in
measuring
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence,
then
the
commonwealth
would
not
have
the
right
to
appeal
in
pennsylvania
because
pennsylvania
practice
limits
commonwealth
appeals
to
pure
questions
of
law,
from
final
orders.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
no,
no.
there
were
two
separate
criminal
episodes
that
were
joined
for
trial,
justice
marshall.
the
one,
arson,
resulted
in
what
we
viewed
as
a
homicide.
that
is
the
subject
of
this
proceeding.
a
separate
charge
of
arson
was
joined
for
trial,
and
when
the
demurrers
were
sustained
to
the
homicide
charges,
the
trial
court
proceeded
in
a
non-jury
fashion
to
adjudicate
the
defendant
guilty
of
that
separate
arson.
he
has
been
convicted
of
that
arson
and
is
serving
a
sentence
right
now
for
that
crime,
that
involving
arson
only.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
there
was
an
appeal
as
to
only
those
charges
that
were
the
subject
of
a
grant
of
demurrer
under
pennsylvania
practice.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
defense
presented
their
evidence.
i
don't
know
whether
they
rested
or
presented
their
evidence.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
the
trial
as
to
the
separate
arson
proceeded,
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
after
the
appeal.
there
was
a
severance
in
effect
granted
of
a
separate
arson
based
on
a
different
building
in
a
different
part
of
allegheny
county,
pennsylvania,
and
that
case
proceeded
separately
to
verdict.
this
proceeding,
which
involves
homicide
charges
and
causing
catastrophe
charges,
was
stayed
by
the
trial
court
while
the
appeal
process
continued
on
those
specific
charges,
those
criminal
informations.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court--
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
--yes,
we
did.
they
did
not
decide
the
merits
of
the
commonwealth's
appeal.
the
court
remanded
that
matter,
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
was
to
remand
the
case
to
the
superior
court
of
pennsylvania
to
consider
the
merits
of
the
commonwealth's
appeal
regarding
the
legal
sufficiency
of
the
evidence,
so
we
have
yet
argue
before
an
appellate
court
and
have
a
decision
with
regard
to
the
legal
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
that
was
produced
in
the
trial
court.
what
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
held
was
that
the
superior
court
had
erred
in
its
review
of
the
demurrer,
in
viewing
it
as
the
same
as
a
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal,
and
the
supreme
court
particularly
looked
at
its
totality
of
practice
and
its
history,
which
was
an
extensive
history
with
regard
to
the
demurrer
being
appealable
in
pennsylvania,
and
it
viewed
it
as
pure
question
of
law
unlike...
and
compared
it
to
the
federal
rule,
rule
29...
unlike
the
federal
rule
which
to
a
certain
extent
may
not
make
the
classic
distinction
that
the
pennsylvania
rule
attempted
to
make.
i
might
note
also
that
the
pennsylvania
rule,
rule
1124(a)-1
was
promulgated
by
the
supreme
court
after
this
court's
decision
in
scott,
aware
of
the
scott
decision,
aware
of
the
martin
linen
decision.
the
supreme
court
through
is
rulemaking
power,
which
is
very
broad,
entered
a
decision
that
a
structured
rule
should
provide
specifically
for
the
demurrer
as
a
separate
item.
the
rest
of
rule
1124
looks
very
much
like
the
federal
rule.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
our
case
before
the
superior
court,
essentially
with
regard
to
two
of
the
crimes
that
were
before
the
trial
court,
was
the
court
had
erred
in
deciding
what
degree
of
recklessness
was
contemplated
to
be
required
to
be
shown
under
pennsylvania's
definition
of
murder
as
a
third
degree--
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
--the
only
thing
that
was
appealed--
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
--the
case
will
go
back
for
trial.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
was
not
a
question
of
fact
but
was
a
pure
question
of
law,
a
determination
of
legal
sufficiency,
the
evidence
on
a
stated
standard.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
the
question
that
we
appealed
to
the
superior
court,
whether
the
court
erred
as
a
matter
of
law
in
ruling
that
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
was
not
established
based
upon
the
elements
of
third
degree
murder
and
causing
a
catastrophe.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
that
is
exactly
the
question
before
the
superior
court,
is
the
legal
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
the
case
will
go
back,
in
the
commonwealth's
view,
either
way
because
the
remaining
charges
on
which
demurrers
were
denied
are
still
before
the
court.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
misdemeanor
charges.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
that's
been
raised
by
both
our
response
to
the
certiorari
petition
by
the
solicitor
general's
amicus
brief
and--
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
--right.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
correct.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
i
agree
that
the
trial
judge
determined
the
legal
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
he
did
not
engage
in--
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
--yes,
he
did.
so
that,
the
superior
court
would
be
presented
with
the
question
of
whether
the
court,
the
trial
court,
properly
ruled
on
the--
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
--i
would
argue
that
the
matter
would
be
remanded
to
the
trial
court
for
continuation
of
trial
with
regard
to
those
remaining--
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
--i
would
say,
go
forward
on
those
charges
which
were
not
disposed
of
my
demurrers,
because
there
were
two
charges--
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
--the
superior
court
decision
would
be
a
final
decision,
much
like
burks
recognized
that
there
would
be
a
final
order.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
correct,
but
it's
a
legal
question
only
as
to--
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
--i
do
not
believe
in
this
case
that
the
court
ned
go
any
further
in
determining
whether
an
acquittal
was
actually
entered
in
the
case.
what
we
are
suggesting
is
that
the
determination
by
the
superior
court
on
our
appeal
will
be
determinative
of
the
legal
question
which
we
had
a
right
to
appeal,
and
therefore
our
right
to
appeal
would
have
been
vindicated
in
the
superior
court,
and
if
we
lose
in
that
matter,
then
the
order
of
the
trial
court
achieves
finality
and
prevents,
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
us
from
arguing
that
the
court
should
continue
on
those
charges
on
which
a
demurrer
has
been
sustained.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
in
essence,
yes,
in
essence.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
well,
i
believe
that
the
trial
court
was
desirous
of
allowing
the
commonwealth
its
right
of
appeal
on
those
charges
that
he
had
sustained
a
demurrer
to.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
and
yet,
the
other
charges
which
were
easily
severable
because
they
were
a
separate
criminal
episode--
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
--no
demurrer
was
sustained
as
to
them.
all
i
can
suggest
to
the
court
in
that
regard
is
that
the
trial
court
and
the
counsel
below
were
concerned
with
the
potential
creation
or
another
double
jeopardy
issue,
when
and
if
the
trial
court
would
proceed
on
other
offenses
which
might
be
viewed
as
lesser
included
offenses
or
offenses
for
which
there
might
be
an
additional
bar
that
might
be
argued.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
possibly.
i
don't
believe
they
are
lesser
included
offenses.
i
think
that
was
a
misunderstanding
in
the
court
below,
that
they
may...
at
the
time
of
this
proceedings
there
was
some
question
in
pennsylvania
whether
involuntary
manslaughter
was
a
lesser
included
offense
of
murder.
subsequent
decisions
have
established
that
it
clearly
is
not.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
that's
basically
our
position,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
well,
my
position
is,
it's
not
an
acquittal.
to
the
extent
that
martin
linen
supply--
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
--well,
i
would
make
a
distinction,
your
honor,
between
the
motion
that's
made
here,
a
demurrer,
prior
to...
at
the
conclusion
of
the
commonwealth's
presentation
of
its
evidence,
and
a
motion
that's
made
at
the
conclusion
of
the
presentation
of
all
of
the
evidence.
now,
in
a
non-jury
situation
i
suggest
that
it
may
be
difficult
to
separate
at
that
point
the
distinction
between
the
court
ruling
as
a
matter
of
law
and
ruling
as
a
matter
of
fact.
it's
not
necessary
for
the
court
in
this
case
to
reach
that
far.
i
think
what
we
have
here
is
a
midtrial
ruling
before
all
of
the
evidence
has
been
completed.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
