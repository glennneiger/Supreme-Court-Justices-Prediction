justice
byron
r.
white
when
did
the
court
hold
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
at
what
stage
of
the
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
this
was
mid-trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
you
demurred
across
the
board?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
were
also
interested
in
having
a
ruling
on
all
of
them,
and
you
would
like--
justice
byron
r.
white
--what
do
they
mean,
a
credibility
determination?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
even
accepting
all
of
it
as
true,
a
ruling
that
it
wasn't
enough
was
not
an
acquittal?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
the
trial
is
all
over
and
there
had
been
a
conviction,
but
then
there
was
a
motion
for
n.o.b.
or
whatever
the
equivalent
is,
and
the
trial
judge
had
then
sustained
it
and
said
there
wasn't
enough
evidence,
"i
don't
care
what
the
jury
held,
there
just
wasn't
enough
evidence.
"
and,
then
there's
an
appeal--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
the
judge--
justice
byron
r.
white
--that
is
really
the
point
of
this
case,
that
it
was
midtrial
and
there
had
to
be
further
proceedings?
justice
byron
r.
white
some
could
be
dead.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
was
no
disagreement,
as
i
understand
it,
between
the
trial
judge
and
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
on
what
the
elements
of
the
crime
were,
no
legal
difference
except
with
respect
to
the
quantum
of
the
evidence.
justice
byron
r.
white
--the
trial
didn't
go
ahead,
did
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
hold?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
did
argue
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
say
that
you
can
only
appeal
on
"legal"
grounds
in
superior...
or
you
can
only
appeal
on
those
grounds.
so,
what
was
your
case
before
the
superior
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
that's
the
only
thing
that
was
appealed?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
only
thing
that
is
left,
and
so
if...
but
if
you
lose
those,
under
the
supreme
court's
ruling,
the
case
will
go
back
for
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
the
supreme
court
said
that
the
trial
court's
ruling
was
not
a
sufficient
ruling
on
the
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
is
a
different
question,
a
new
appeal?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
seems
to
me
that--
justice
byron
r.
white
--part
of
your
arguments
is
that
the
issue
of
the...
the
double
jeopardy
issue,
just
isn't
right
for
review
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
if
you
lose
in
the
superior
court
on
remand,
where
you
have
argued
that
the
judge
misunderstood
the
legal
requirements
of
the
crimes?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
the
question
would,
even
under
your
view,
be
right,
was
the...
is
a
retrial...
can
the
trial
go
back
for
a
continuation
because...
in
spite
of
the
trial
judge's
ruling
on
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
you
agree
the
trial
judge
ruled
on
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
he
understood
the
crime
correctly,
then
he
did
rule
on
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
say
that
if
you
lose
in
the
superior
court,
would
you
argue
that
the
trial
may
continue
despite
the
fact
that
then
it
will
be
clear
that
the
trial
judge,
a,
understood
the
elements
of
the
crime
and,
b,
ruled
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
say
it
could
go
forward
despite
the
double
jeopardy
clause?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
charges
that
were
not
disposed
of
by
demurrer...
that
were
disposed
of
by
demurrer?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
the
state
concedes
that
if
a
trial
judge
properly
understood
the
elements
of
the
crime
in
this
case,
his
ruling
was
an
acquittal
to
the
extent
that
he
sustained
the
demurrer?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
the
state...
the
double
jeopardy
clause
would
forbid
the
continuation
of
the
trial
on
those
issues?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
just
told
the
superior
court
that
it
misunderstood
what
the
state's
appeal
was
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
your
position
is
that
in
a
trial...
short
of
a
jury,
for
that
matter,
you
get
into...
the
prosecution
gets
into
an
argument
with
the
judge
on
what
the
elements
of
the
crime
are,
and
the
trial
judge
says,
"i
disagree
with
you,
mr.
prosecutor.
"
"you
have
to
prove
a,
b
and
c..
"
and
at
the
close
of
your
case
or
the
whole
case
he
says,
"the
evidence
is
insufficient
because
you
didn't
prove
c.
"
acquittal.
now,
you
say
that
the
state
may
appeal
that
acquittal
because
the
judge
misunderstood
the
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
my
example
is
not
an
acquittal.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
frey,
i
still
don't
understand
what
you
mean,
"legally
insufficient",
or
"legal
sufficiency".
what
do
you
mean?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
he
says
to
himself,
could
any
reasonable
set
of
jurors
find
this
evidence
sufficient
to
find
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
is
that
the
kind
of
question
you're
talking
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
his
saying
that
at
midtrial
doesn't
bar
an
appeal?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
understand
pennsylvania
to
be
asking
us
to
reconsider
any
of
our
prior
cases.
the
united
states
seems
to
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
scott?
justice
byron
r.
white
martin
linen
is
right
in
your
teeth,
i
think?
