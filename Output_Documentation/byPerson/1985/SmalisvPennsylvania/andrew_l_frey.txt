mr.
andrew
l.
frey
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
first
of
all,
the
issue
that
is
before
the
court
today
concerns
only
the
ability
of
the
courts
to
correct
legally
erroneous
judgments
of
evidentiary
insufficiency
by
the
trial
court.
if
the
judgment
is
not
legally
wrong,
that
is,
if
the
trial
court
was
correct
in
finding
the
evidence
insufficient,
the
appellate
court
will
affirm,
there
will
be
no
further
trial
type
proceedings
of
the
kind
to
which
the
double
jeopardy
clause
could
apply.
so,
your
decision
on
this
case
will
affect
only
the
class
of
cases
in
which
the
defendant
has
induced
the
trial
court
to
make
a
legally
erroneous
decision.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we'll
take
an
appeal
but
there's
nothing--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--that
is
true,
but
i
think
this
court's
jurisprudence
makes
it
quite
clear
that
nothing
in
the
double
jeopardy
clause
makes
the
appeal
itself,
the
burden
of
the
appeal
itself,
prohibited
and
wilson
dealt
with
and
disposed
of
that
problem.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
question
is,
what...
well,
i
think
the
trial
court
in
a
jury
trial,
for
instance,
can
rule
only
on
a
question
of
law.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
it's
a
legal
determination.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
our
position.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
exactly...
i
think
there
is
a
legitimate
question
in
this
case
as
to
whether
what
the
judge
said
was
an
acquittal
or
not
in
the
true
sense,
and
i'd
like
to
talk
for
a
minute
if
i
may
about
what
constitutes--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
think
if
the
judge...
i
think
what
we
are
saying,
it's
not
reviewable
as
to
verdict
of
acquittal.
that
is
a
determination
by
the
finder
of
fact
that
the
defendant
is
not
in
fact
guilty
of
the
crime.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
or
not
reviewable,
whether
it's
right
or
wrong,
okay.
now,
the
judge,
however,
performs
a
different
function
and
in
this
case
he
did
not
purport
to
act
and
the
pennsylvania
court
did
not
treat
him
as
acting
as
finder
of
fact
when
he
granted
the
demurrer,
but
acting
the
same
way
he
would
if
there
had
been
a
jury,
and
taking
the
case
a
way
from
the
jury.
now,
there
is
a
sense
in
which
it
is
an
acquittal.
that
is,
in
scott
we
were
talking
about
pre-indictment
delay
claim,
and
the
majority
held
that
you
could
distinguish
between
that
kind
of
claim
which
does
not
go
at
all,
does
not
represent
at
all
a
finding
of
guilt
or
innocence,
and
the
kind
of
claim
that
could
represent
an
acquittal.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
why
i
wanted
to
talk
about
the
different
ways
in
which
there
could
be
findings
of
insufficient
evidence.
justice
white
referred
to
one
way,
but
before
we
get
to
that
way,
the
judge
might
have
a
correct
understanding
of
the
elements
of
the
offense,
but
the
judge
might
decide
that
you
can't
convict
the
defendant
on
the
basis
of
circumstantial
evidence,
for
instance.
therefore,
even
though
there
was
overwhelming
circumstantial
evidence
of
guilt,
as
to
every
element
of
the
offense,
the
judge
might
enter
an
acquittal.
that
would
be
one
kind
of
ruling.
now,
that
doesn't
involve
a
misunderstanding
of
the
offense
that
is
in
a
sense
an
acquittal.
i
think
we
would
argue
that
it
should
be
reviewable.
but,
justice
white's
example
was
a
different
kind.
the
judge
may
add
to
the
offense
an
element
which
is
not
in
fact
or
in
law
a
part
of
that
offense.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
ultimately
we
would
contend
that
either
one
of
those
conclusions
would
be
reviewable.
we
think
they
are
conclusions
of
law.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i'm
not
sure
it
is
the
same
thing
as
they
are
arguing,
but
i
think
the
important
question
is
whether...
i
mean,
i
think
there
is
an
initial
question
that
the
court
has
to
grapple
with,
and
that
is,
if
this
animal
that
we
have
is
a
determination
by
the
judge
that
the
defendant
hasn't
committed
a
crime,
then
can
it
ever
be
appealed
and
corrected,
regardless
of
what
is
wrong
as
a
legal
matter
with
that
determination.
because,
there
are
suggestions,
i
think
in
martin
linen
and
some
suggestions
in
scott
that
it
couldn't
be,
and
we
are
asking
the
court
to
reconsider
that
question
in
terms
of
the
policies
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
we
think
that
allowing
an
appeal
in
a
situation
where
the
defendant
has
induced
the
court
to
commit
a
legal
error,
has
terminated
the
trial
prior
to
a
verdict
by
the
fact
finder
to
correct
that
error,
has
none
of
the...
involves
no
semblance
of
the
kind
of
oppressive
practices
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
i
think
our
reading
of
martin
linen
is
that
you
would
have
to,
because
in
our
view--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--there's
no
problem
with
the
holding
in
scott,
and
indeed
no
problem...
indeed,
we
suggest
that
the
analysis
of
scott,
there
is
some
language
that's
troublesome
but
the
analysis
of
scott
is
in
fact
quite
inconsistent
with--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--that
is
our
feeling,
that's
right.
but,
i
think
that
scott
has
undermined
martin
linen
and
i
think
it's
appropriate
for
the
court
to
reconsider
martin
linen
after
scott,
and
i'd
like
to
talk
about
the
double
jeopardy
policies
that
might
be
considered
to
justify
what
seems
a
quite
arbitrary
result
that
denies
justice
to
the
prosecution,
which
is
to
leave
legally
erroneous
decisions,
concededly
legally
erroneous
because
those
are
the
only
ones
we
are
talking
about,
beyond
review
and
correction.
one
policy
is
the
finality
of
judgment,
that
is,
not
allowing
the
prosecution
to
improve
its
case
when
it
has
failed
to
persuade
the
first
fact
finder
that
has
heard
the
case.
that
would
be
true
where
you
have
a
verdict
of
acquittal.
it's
not
true
in
this
case
because
there
has
been
no
failure
to
persuade
the
fact
finder
in
a
case
where
the
judge
takes
the
case
away
from
the
jury,
of
guilt.
certainly
there
is
the
right
to
have
the
trial
completed
before
the
first
tribunal
that
is
empaneled,
and
that
is
the
right
that
was
considered
and
evaluated
in
scott,
and
obviously
the
point
here
is
that
there
would
be
no
second
trial
necessary,
no
appearance
before
a
second
tribunal,
if
the
defendant
had
not
chosen
to
terminate
the
trial
before
verdict.
the
defendant
who
wants
only
one
trial
can
allow
the
first
trial
to
go
to
verdict,
make
his
or
her
motions
after
verdict,
get
a
judgment
of
acquittal
at
that
point
from
the
judge.
it
can
then
be
appealed
and
either
affirmed
or
reversed
without
the
necessity
for
a
second
trial.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
am
not
sure
what
the
answer--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--that
would
create
a
problem.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
there
may
be,
but
i
don't
understand...
that
would
be
a
non-constitutional
rule,
and
it
could
presumably
be
corrected
and
if
that
were
the
obstacle,
remove
the
constitutional
problem
here.
it's
not
a
rule
that
makes
a
lot
of
sense
to
me,
but
there
may
be
some
states
that
have
it.
now,
in
justice
brennan's
dissent
in
scott,
he
spoke
of
the
burdens
of
retrial,
the
emotional
strain,
the
expense,
the
risk
of
an
erroneous
conviction,
the
wearing
down,
and
all
these
problems.
these
are
very
real
problems,
but
you
cannot
distinguish
this
kind
of
case
from
a
case
in
which
there
is
a
hung
jury
and
a
retrial
with
all
those
burdens,
or
a
case
in
which
a
conviction
is
reversed
and
there
is
a
retrial
with
all
those
burdens.
in
fact,
if
you
think
about
it
for
a
moment,
when
there
is
legal
error
injected
by
the
prosecution
or
the
court
over
the
objection
of
the
defense
that
paints
a
verdict
of
guilty,
the
law
is
clear
that
that
can
be
reversed
and
there
can
be
a
new
trial.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
there
are
two
pieces
to
that.
if
the
jury
returns
a
verdict
of
not
guilty,
we
are
not
arguing
that
that
can
be
further
reviewed,
no
matter
what.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
an
argument
could
be
made,
and
we
have
a
footnote--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--certainly,
justice
cardozo
in
palco
against
connecticut
thought
that
would
be
a
better
system,
but
at
least
there
we
don't
know
what
the
jury
has
done.
the
prosecution
has
failed
to
convince
the
first
fact
finder,
and
the
considerations
that
are
identified
in
green
do
apply.
in
this
situation,
none
of
those
considerations
have
any
application.
now,
i
should
say
a
word
in
connection
with
your
question
about
sanabria,
because
sanabria
is
a
case
where
essentially
that
happened,
that
is,
the
evidence
was
suppressed.
what
was
left
was
insufficient.
the
judge
granted
an
acquittal.
we
have
no
problem
with
the
correctness
of
sanabria,
because
we
couldn't
appeal
the
evidentiary
suppression
rule.
because
that
was
so,
when
the
judge
granted
an
acquittal,
there
was
no
evidence.
