mr.
chief
justice,
and
if
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
the
validity
of
pennsylvania's
rule
permitting
the
commonwealth
to
appeal
an
insufficiency
determination
made
at
the
close
of
a
timely
rights
case.
the
rule
was
established
with
very
little
discussion
or
analysis
at
a
time
when
the
double
jeopardy
clause
did
not
apply
to
the
states.
with
this
case
it
suddenly
became
a
rule
in
season
of
a
rationale.
the
defendants
were
charged
each
with
two
counts
of
murder
and
various
lesser
charges
as
a
result
of
a
fire
in
a
restaurant-apartment
building
that
they
owned.
the
trial
was
non-jury.
the
case
was
largely
circumstantial.
at
the
close
of
the
commonwealth's
case,
the
defendants
challenged
the
sufficiency
of
the
commonwealth's
evidence.
they
did
this
with
a
motion
that
we
call
a
demurrer
in
pennsylvania,
a
demurrer
to
the
evidence.
the
issue
raised
by
a
demurrer
to
the
evidence
is
the
same
as
the
issue
raised
by
a
rule
29
motion
in
federal
court.
if
it's
true,
is
it
enough.
the
court
found
that
the
evidence,
even
if
true,
was
insufficient
to
establish
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
either
of
the
defendants
set
the
fire.

december
of
1980.
ms.
norma
chase
the
commonwealth
had
rested,
and
the
defendants
demurred
to
the
evidence.
ms.
norma
chase
yes,
but
the
commonwealth
had
rested.
the
court,
however,
denied
demurrer
with
respect
to
involuntary
manslaughter
and
various
lesser
charges
involving
a
reckless
state
of
mind.
the
district
attorney's
office
appealed
the
order
sustaining
the
demurrer
and
asked
that
trial
of
the
remaining
charges
be
stayed
depending
the
outcome
of
the
appeal.
the
district
attorney's
office
also
asked
for
reconsideration
of
the
order
sustaining
the
demurrer,
and
the
commonwealth
presently
finds
it
significant,
as
they
indicate
at
footnote
11
at
page
46
of
their
brief,
that
the
defendants
at
that
juncture
joined
in
the
commonwealth's
request
that
the
ruling
in
favor
of
the
defendants
be
reconsidered.
we
put
our
reasons
on
the
record
at
the
time.
defendants
wanted
so
desperately
to
complete
the
trial
on
the
involuntary
manslaughter
and
the
remaining
charges
that
they
were
willing
to
suffer
the
reinstatement
of
the
murder
charges
with
all
the
risks
that
that
entailed,
so
that
they
could
complete
the
trial
rather
than
have
the
trial
interrupted
for
an
appeal.
ms.
norma
chase
my
understanding
is,
you
don't.
ms.
norma
chase
that's
true.
they
had
lived
in
that
courtroom
for
six
weeks.
they
didn't
want
to
be
in
there
another
six
weeks
putting
in
their
defense,
and
they
wanted
to
know,
what
charges
did
we
already
win
on.
it
was
just,
basically,
a
matter
of
economy
at
that
point.
ms.
norma
chase
yes,
we
were
interested
in
weeding
out
anything
that
the--
ms.
norma
chase
--naturally.
we
wanted
to
know
where
we
stood
with
the
court
on
all
the
charges,
so
that
we
should
know
what
charges
we
should
direct
our
defense
to.
on
reconsideration
the
court
reaffirmed
its
original
order.
the
remaining
charges
were
stayed
over
our
objection
pending
the
outcome
of
the
appeal.
two
and
a
half
years
later
the
superior
court
quashed
the
appeal
on
double
jeopardy
grounds
and
invalidated
the
pennsylvania
rule.
they
reconfirmed
that
decision
on
re-argument
about
a
year
later.
about
a
year
ago
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
reversed
and
remanded
to
the
superior
court
for
consideration
of
the
merits
of
the
commonwealth
appeal,
and
it
was
at
that
juncture
that
we
asked
for
certiorari.
the
commonwealth's
position,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
since
the
trial
judge
made
no
decision
with
respect
to
credibility
in
ruling
on
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence,
his
decision
does
not
go
to
the
factual
elements
of
the
crime.
it's
unrelated
to
factual
guilt
or
innocence.
essentially,
the
commonwealth
looks
at
scott,
sees
the
words
"factual
guilt",
and
thinks
that
this
court
is
saying
that
there
is
another,
unrelated
kind
of
guilt.
i
can
find
no
language
in
either
martin
linen
or
scott
that
suggests
that
kind
of
distinction
or
that
in
any
way
suggests
there
has
to
be
a
credibility
determination
before
there
can
be
an
acquittal,
and
i
think
burks
is
clearly
to
the
contrary.
ms.
norma
chase
what
they're
saying
is,
since
the
judge
did
not
determine
whether
the
evidence
presented
on
behalf
of
the
commonwealth
was
true,
but
assumed
it
to
be
true
for
purposes
of
deciding
on
the
demurrer,
his
ruling
was
not
an
acquittal.
it
did
not
go
to
the
merits
of
the
case.
ms.
norma
chase
that's
the
commonwealth's
position.
i
would
submit
also
that
this
case
presents
a
stronger
case
against
allowing
review
than
martin
linen
because
in
martin
linen
the
defendant
had
been
looking
at
retrial
before
the
insufficiency
decision
was
made,
because
the
jury
had
been
discharged
without
reaching
a
verdict.
martin
linen,
i
believe,
also
discloses
a
manifest
necessity
argument.
there
was
clearly
no
mistrial
here.
i
believe
that
the
commonwealth's
argument
that
the
defendants
waived
their
double
jeopardy
rights
by
challenging
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
when
they
did
is
adequately
answered
by
sanabria.
i
would
add
that
this
case
presents
none
of
the
quirks
of
the
sanabria
case.
there
are
no
evidentiary
rulings
at
issue
here.
this
was
basically
a
circumstantial
case
that
the
trial
court
found
did
not
measure
up
to
the
standard
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
ms.
norma
chase
yes.
the
burks
decision,
as
i
understand
it,
did
not
turn
on
any
credibility
determination.
there
was
a
conclusion
in
burks
that
no
matter
what
evidence
the
court
might
believe,
it
still
is
not
enough.
no
decision
had
been
made
in
the
burks
case
as
to
credibility
of
witnesses,
but
the
decision
was
still
an
acquittal.
i
note
that
there
has
been
some
disagreement
within
this
court
as
to
whether
every
refinement
of
double
jeopardy
law
as
developed
in
federal
cases
applies
lock,
stock
and
barrel
to
the
states.
i
would
hope
that
however
that
debate
ultimately
turns
out,
the
states
will
not
be
held
to
be
free
to
avoid
the
finality
of
acquittals
by
calling
acquittals
something
else
when
they're
entered
at
the
close
of
the
commonwealth's
case,
a
stage
well
after
when
the
defendant
has
been
placed
in
jeopardy.
i
would
hope
also
that
the
states
are
not
going
to
be
free
to
hold
that
a
defendant
waives
his
double
jeopardy
rights
by
asking
to
be
acquitted.
the
rights
involved
here
may
not
be
quite
as
fundamental
as
the
right
not
to
be
retried
after
a
classic,
traditional
jury
verdict
of
not
guilty,
but
i
would
submit
that
they
are
certainly
not
peripheral
or
incidental
to
the
purposes
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
as
i
indicated
this
morning--
ms.
norma
chase
--in
that
case
the
verdict--
ms.
norma
chase
--may
be
reinstated
without
placing
the
defendant
back
into
jeopardy.
ms.
norma
chase
correct,
that's
correct.
in
wilson,
what
the
defendant
gets
from
the
appellate
court
is,
go
directly
to
jail,
do
not
pass
go.
these
defendants
would
at
least
have
to
go
back
for
resumption
of
the
non-jury
trial.
but
here
we
have
a
situation,
since
this
trial
is
non-jury,
the
judge
in
holding
essentially
that
a
reasonable
doubt
existed
as
a
matter
of
law,
was
necessarily
saying
that
there
was
such
a
doubt
in
his
own
mind.
at
least,
i've
never
heard
a
trial
judge
say,
any
reasonable
person
would
have
a
doubt
but
this
court
has
none.
ms.
norma
chase
i
would
certainly
hope
not.
i
think
the
impact
on
different
trial
judges
are
going
to
be
different,
but
there
are
situations
in
which
allowing
the
prosecutor
to
walk
back
into
court
years
later
with
an
appellate
opinion
telling
the
judge
how
wrong
he
was
in
entertaining
that
doubt
at
the
close
of
the
prosecution's
case,
is
going
to
put
some
pressure
on
the
judge
to
convict.
he
can
still
acquit,
but
he
has
to
find
some
other
basis,
and
he's
put
in
the
position
of
having
to
justify
an
acquittal
at
that
point.
ms.
norma
chase
the
other
charges?
ms.
norma
chase
if
he
had
done
that,
under
pennsylvania
law--
ms.
norma
chase
--it's
not
proper,
although
it
has
been
done.
there
have
been
cases
where
the
judge
has
said,
"i
sustain
demurrer
and
i
find
the
defendant
not
guilty.
"
ms.
norma
chase
appellate
courts
have
said,
the
judge's
decision
was
improper,
but
it
bars
review.
if
he
uses
the
magic
words
"acquit"
or
"not
guilty",
the
decision
will
not
be
reviewable.
i
would
point
out
also
that
if
this
trial
is
resumed
as
the
commonwealth
suggests,
although
the
prosecutor
doesn't
get
to
re-do
his
case
in
chief,
he
doesn't
become
a
bystander
merely
because
he's
rested.
pennsylvania
law
gives
a
party
who
has
rested
the
right
to
re-open
his
case
if
additional
evidence
has
come
to
light.
ms.
norma
chase
yes.
he
also
has
the
right
to
put
in
evidence
in
rebuttal,
and
he
also
has
the
right
to
cross
examine
and
impeach
defense
witnesses,
perhaps
with
the
aid
of
whatever
he
has
learned
in
the
5-year
recess.
and,
i
would
submit
that
it
is
just
not
realistic
to
say
that
the
risks
of
multiple
prosecution
are
not
presented
by
the
resumption
of
a
non-jury
trial.
it
is
a
second
crack,
and
it
is
offensive
to
the
letter
and
the
spirit
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
thank
you.
ms.
norma
chase
that's
never
really
been
decided.
some
of
the
older
cases,
when
they
sustained
a
demurrer
in
a
non-jury
trial,
said,
reversed
with
a
procidendo,
merely
said
reversed
with
a
procidendo.
more
recently
the
practice
has
been
simply
to
remand
for
a
new
trial.
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
did
not
accept
the
alternative
of
resuming
the
non-jury
trial,
apparently
because
they
wanted
to
hang
onto
a
rule
that
let
the
prosecutor
appeal
whether
the
trial
was
jury
or
non-jury.
so,
that's
never
really
been
determined.
i'm
aware
of
one
case
in
which
the
non-jury
trial
was
simply
resumed
on
remand.
to
my
knowledge
there
have
been
no
appellate
decisions
concerning
that
procedure.
ms.
norma
chase
it
would
be
the
same
as
a
mistrial
situation
procedurally,
because
trial
would
just
start
from
scratch.
ms.
norma
chase
right,
there's
no
certainty
there.
ms.
norma
chase
beg
pardon?
ms.
norma
chase
that's
true.
i
mean,
obviously
there
are
some
risks
to
the
prosecutor
as
well
as
the
defense
with
multiple
prosecutions.
thank
you.
ms.
norma
chase
i
have
nothing
further.
thank
you.
