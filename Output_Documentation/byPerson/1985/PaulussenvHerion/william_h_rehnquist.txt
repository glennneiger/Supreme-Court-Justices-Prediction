all
we're
saying
is,
there's
a
pennsylvania
statute
that's
come
in
between
this
case
and
this
court,
and
in
the
interim
we
will
send
it
back
to
let
the
state
pass
on
it,
on
its
statute.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
for
purposes
of
our
decision
we
assume
that's
true,
even
though
it
may
not
be?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i
understand,
but
do
you
think
your
argument
on
the
fact
finding
process
applies
with
the
same
force
to
a
case
in
which
there
had
been
a
period...
it
had
to
be
proved,
of
course...
of
support?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i'm
talking
about
the
one
at
issue
here.
supposing...
and
this
is
not
right,
it's
kind
of
a
hypothetical...
supposing
the
only
interest
the
state
has
to
justify
the
statute,
with
this
concern
about
the
emotional
impact
on
the
father
who
is
sued
too
late,
and
supposing
now
that
possibility
will
exist
regardless
of
how
we
decide
this
case
because
you've
got
a
new
statute,
and
that
therefore
there
really
is
no
present
state
interest
to
justify
the
statute.
would
it
be
valid
or
invalid?
