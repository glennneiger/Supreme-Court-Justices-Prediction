justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this.
supposing
you
filed
this
complaint
on
the
1st
of
december
of
last
year
instead
of
now,
and
then
on
january
15th
of
something
they
came
in
with
the
statute
of
limitations
defense.
would
you
not
then
have
argued
that
the
new
statute
applies?
you
wouldn't
have
just
thrown
in
the
towel
on
the
issue,
would
you?
