mr.
joseph
n.
onek
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
the
outset,
we
do
not
oppose
remand
in
this
case.
although
in
fact
we
agree
with
appellant's
view
on
retroactivity,
the
cases
we
both
rely
on
are
cases
from
the
intermediate
courts
in
pennsylvania
such
as
williams
v.
wolfe.
there
has
been
no
definitive
resolution
by
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
on
the
retroactivity
of
the
18-year
statute
and
we
would
not
oppose
a
remand
on
that
issue.
mr.
joseph
n.
onek
yes,
we
do
agree
to
that.
in
fact,
the
pennsylvania
courts,
at
least
as
we
understand
the
law,
would
interpret
it
the
way
appellant
has.
but
there
has
been
no
definitive
resolution,
and
indeed
the
cases
we
both
rely
on,
williams
versus
wolfe,
are
superior
court,
not
supreme
court
cases.
mr.
joseph
n.
onek
that
is
my
understanding.
mr.
joseph
n.
onek
your
honor,
i'm
a
washington
lawyer,
not
a
philadelphia
lawyer.
i
do
not
know
how
long
it
would
take
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
to
resolve
this
issue.
and,
i
turn
to
the
constitutional
issue.
in
1980
petitioner
filed...
appellant
filed
a
petition
for
support,
at
issue
in
this
case.
at
that
time
there
was
a
six-year
statute
of
limitations
for
paternity
actions.
we
submit
that
that
statute
of
limitations
was
constitutional
and
that
therefore
appellant's
petition
was
properly
barred.
this
court
has
established
the
criteria
for
determining
whether
a
statute
of
limitations
in
a
paternity
action
is
constitutional
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
joseph
n.
onek
that
has
always
been
denied
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
n.
onek
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
n.
onek
that
was
also
denied,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that
appellee
has
admitted
support
during
the
early
years
of
the
child.
the
first
criterion
is
whether
the
statute
of
limitations
is
substantially
related
to
the
state's
interest
in
preventing
stale
or
fraudulent
claims.
the
second
criterion
is
whether
the
statute
of
limitations
provides
a
reasonable
opportunity
for
the
child
to
obtain
child
support
through
litigation.
mr.
joseph
n.
onek
no,
i
believe
there
has
been
no
such
finding.
mr.
joseph
n.
onek
yes,
there
was
an
allegation.
mr.
joseph
n.
onek
yes,
we
take
it
on
the
face
of
the
complaint.
there
was
an
allegation
that
he
contributed
support
through--
mr.
joseph
n.
onek
--that
is
right.
mr.
joseph
n.
onek
no,
no,
that
just
states
that
he
is
potentially
liable
on
a
going
forward
basis
if
paternity
is
proved.
mr.
joseph
n.
onek
i
hope
not.
i
certainly
hope
not.
let
me
turn
to
the
state's
interest
in
this
case.
every
statute
of
limitations
has
two
purposes,
first
to
assure
the
accuracy
of
the
fact
finding
process,
and
second,
to
maintain
settled
expectations,
so-called
principle
of
repose.
with
respect
to
the
fact
finding
issue,
it
is
of
course
true
that
scientific
tasting
has
reduced
the
possibility
of
false
accusations
of
paternity,
but
the
new
scientific
tests,
including
the
hla
test
which
is
used
in
pennsylvania,
is
not
conclusive.
the
leading
study,
the
one
cited
by
amici,
the
terasaki
study
of
1,000
people,
shows
that
in
ten
percent
of
those
cases
the
hla
test
could
make
no
resolution
at
all,
and
in
the
other
cases
where
it
did
indicate
probatively
that
the
defendant
was
the
rather,
the
degree
of
probability
ranged
from
90
percent
to
higher.
there
is
no
court
in
the
united
states
which
treats
hla
tests
as
conclusive.
to
the
contrary,
all
of
them
permit
a
defendant
to
submit
evidence
on
such
issues
as
non-access
to
the
mother
during
the
relevant
time
period.
what
kind
of
evidence
must
the
defendant
rely
on?
obviously,
he
must
rely
on
witnesses
who
are
available,
on
the
memory
of
those
witnesses
and
his
own
memory,
and
in
some
cases,
of
course,
he
must
rely
on
documentary
evidence
like
appointment
calendars,
credit
card
records
and
so
forth.
there
can
be
no
question
that
the
accuracy
and
reliability
of
that
evidence
diminishes
over
time.
it
is
far
more
difficult
for
a
defendant
to
reconstruct
his
activities
and
the
activities
of
the
mother
six
years
or
ten
years
after
the
event
than
it
would
be
for
him
to
reconstruct
those
activities
one
year,
two
years,
or
three
years
after
the
event.
mr.
joseph
n.
onek
your
honor,
i
think
that,
regrettably,
is
too
simple
a
way
of
putting
it.
the
statistical
basis
for
these
tests
is
very
complex.
in
some
cases
the
tests
will
show
up
nothing
at
all.
in
the--
mr.
joseph
n.
onek
--ten
percent,
the
cases
will
provide
no
evidence
whatsoever,
and
of
course
in
advance--
mr.
joseph
n.
onek
--that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
n.
onek
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
n.
onek
that
is
correct,
and
in
some
cases
even
higher.
but
nevertheless,
every
court
enables
defendant
to
put
on
evidence,
and
as
i
said,
that
evidence
diminishes
over
time.
it
becomes
more
and
more
difficult.
now,
there's
no
magic
to
a
six-year
statute
of
limitations,
but
we
do
think
that
a
state
could
reasonably
conclude
that
after
that
period
of
time
the
reliability
of
all
the
evidence
that
it
does
permit
the
defendant
to
put
in,
testimony
from
the
mother
and
the
defendant,
testimony
of
other
witnesses
and
so
forth,
decreases.
and
so,
with
respect
to
the
fact-finding
process,
we
submit
that
six
years
is
a
reasonable
period.
mr.
joseph
n.
onek
under
pennsylvania
law,
if
the
father
has
contributed
support,
that's
an
exception
to
his
six-year
statute
and
it
gives
the
mother
more
time.
in
other
words,
if
the
father
had
provided
support
for
seven
years,
then
the
mother
could
come
in
two
years
later,
even
in
nine
years,
and
bring
it.
but
that's
not
the
case
here.
that
is,
even
the
allegation
of
support
says
that
it
ended
in
1975.
mr.
joseph
n.
onek
oh,
absolutely,
your
honor,
because
there
are
many
circumstances
in
which
a
man
may
support
a
child
of
a
friend
because
he
admires
and
loves
the
mother,
not
because
he
concedes
in
any
way
that
he
is
the
father
of
that
child.
so,
i
don't
think
the
argument
is
changed.
there
was
a
second
purpose
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
it's
to
maintain
settled
expectations,
and
i
think
that's
particularly
important
in
defendant's...
in
these
types
of
cases.
after
all,
the
defendant
does
not
necessarily
know
that
he's
the
father.
he's
contesting
that.
and
in
some
cases
he
may
not
even
know
that
the
child
in
question
has
been
born.
yet,
under
appellant's
theory,
ten
years
after
the
fact
or
25
years
after
the
fact,
he
can
suddenly
be
accused
of
being
the
father
of
an
illegitimate
child.
and
what
are
the
consequences
of
that?
i
think
there
are
two
sets
of...
first,
there
can
be
enormously
significant
adverse
emotional
and
social
consequences
to
being
accused
15
years
after
the
event
of
being
the
father
of
an
illegitimate
child.
it
can
disrupt
your
relationship
with
your
current
family.
it
can
jeopardize
your
status
in
the
community,
even
your
employment.
for
that
reason
we
think
that
a
state
can
reasonably
say,
give
the
defendant
fair
notice.
if
you
think
he's
the
father,
tell
him
within
six
years
so
he
can
make
the
necessary
adjustments.
mr.
joseph
n.
onek
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
n.
onek
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
n.
onek
i
believe
that
every
state,
your
honor,
will
move
to
the
18-year
period.
i'm
merely
saying
that
when
this
petition
was
filled
and
when
pennsylvania
passed
this
law,
was
it
reasonable
for
them
to
say,
fair
notice
should
be
given
to
the
defendant
within
six
years,
and
we
think
it
should.
in
addition
to
these
emotional
and
social
consequences,
of
course
there
are
the
financial
consequences.
a
defendant
who
has
not
known
that
he
has
a
child
for
ten
or
15
years,
has
not
saved
up
money
or
made
the
other
kind
of
planning
that
legitimate
fathers
often
do
to
take
care
of
their
children.
so,
in
some
cases,
there
can
be
a
sudden
and
unexpected
burden.
mr.
joseph
n.
onek
oh,
under
the
new
statute,
that
is
correct.
i'm
merely
saying--
mr.
joseph
n.
onek
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
there
is
a
magic
dividing
line,
but
i
think
there
are
several
things
that
can
be
said
about
the
six-year
statute
of
limitations.
if
you
look
at
statutes
of
limitations
generally,
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania
or
other
states,
six
years
is
on
the
high
end.
in
pennsylvania,
for
example,
generally
torts
are
two
years;
contracts
are
four
years.
six
years,
if
you
look
at
the
state's
general
policies
with
regard
to
settled
expectations,
with
regard
to
the
accuracy
of
the
fact
finding
process,
six
is
on
the
high
end.
mr.
joseph
n.
onek
i
am
familiar
with
that
case,
your
honor,
and
i
don't
deny
the
slippery
slope.
i
merely
say
that
if
you
look
at
statutes
of
limitations
generally,
six
years
is
at
the
high
end,
and
that
leads
me
to
this
point--
mr.
joseph
n.
onek
--yes,
but
i
think
it's
a
very
different
situation
because
all
the
arguments
i
have
just
made
about
fairness
to
the
father
don't
apply
with
the
same
force
when
the
father
is
dead.
the
emotional
and
social
impact
on
the
father
obviously
doesn't
exist
when
the
father
is
already
deceased.
so,
i
think
you
have
different
factors.
in
addition,
in
pennsylvania
you
do
have
a
much
higher
standard
when
the
father
is
dead,
clear
and
convincing
as
opposed
to
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
now,
in
assessing,
and
i
think
this
goes
to
your
point,
justice
o'connor,
in
assessing
the
validity
of
pennsylvania's
interest
in
the
statute
of
limitations,
it's
important
to
emphasize
that
prior
to
1984
pennsylvania
did
not
have
a
provision
generally
totalling
the
statute
of
limitations
during
impact.
in
other
words,
any
child,
a
legitimate
child
or
illegitimate
child
who
was
involved
in
a
slip
and
fall
case
had
a
two
year
statute
of
limitations.
i
think
this
demonstrates
that
pennsylvania
took
very
seriously
its
statute
of
limitations.
it
also
demonstrates
that
you
cannot
say
that
pennsylvania
was
somehow
singling
out
paternity
actions
and
discriminating
against
paternity
actions.
to
the
contrary,
the
six-year
statute
of
limitations,
in
effect,
the
paternity
action
in
1980,
was
substantially
longer
than
the
two-year
statute
of
limitations
that
was
in
affect
for
tort
cases,
for
illegitimate
or
legitimate
children.
now,
it
is
true
that
in
1984
pennsylvania
changed
its
position.
it
did
adopt,
like
many
other
states,
a
general
totalling
provision.
the
question
then
becomes
whether,
when
pennsylvania
eliminated
the
statute
of
limitations
for
infants,
in
most
general
cases,
did
it
also
have
to
eliminate
the
six-year
statute
of
limitation
for
paternity
actions,
and
we
submit
that
it
did
not.
there
are
very
different
interests
at
stake
in
a
paternity
action
situation.
the
general
totalling
provision
applies
primarily
to
tort
cases.
it
is
one
thing
for
a
defendant
to
be
accused
15
years
after
the
fact
of
being
a
tort
feasor.
it
is
another
thing
for
a
defendant
to
be
accused
15
years
after
the
fact
of
being
a
father
of
an
illegitimate
child.
as
i
have
just
noted,
the
emotional
and
social
consequences
of
that
accusation
and
that
determination
are
much
greater,
so
that
any
state--
mr.
joseph
n.
onek
--that
is
correct.
pennsylvania
has
changed
its
law.
i'm
just
saying--
mr.
joseph
n.
onek
--i'm
not
certain,
now,
which
statute
we're
talking
about.
mr.
joseph
n.
onek
i
think
the
statute
as
it
existed
prior
to
the
new
statute
is
still
valid.
i
think
that
when
the
state--
mr.
joseph
n.
onek
--yes,
because
i
believe
that
when
a
state
changes
its
policy
on
a
going-forward
basis,
that
doesn't
mean
that
prior
to
that,
the
previous
statute
was
unconstitutional.
also,
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
you'd
have
a
very
awkward
way
of
making
that
argument
because
here
it
is
probably
true
that
pennsylvania
changed
its
law,
not
because
it
revisited
the
question
of
its
interest
but
under
duress
from
the
federal
legislation.
mr.
joseph
n.
onek
that
is
correct,
but
i
don't
believe
that
when
a
new
statute
is
enacted,
the
previous
statute
suddenly
becomes
unconstitutional.
as
i
was
saying
about
the
change
in
1984,
i
believe
the
legislature
in
1984
could
legitimately
say,
we
are
changing
the
statute
of
limitations
in
tort
cases.
paternity
actions
are
much
more
sensitive
and
we're
not
sure
what
we're
going
to
do
about
that.
after
all,
this
court
has
often
said
that
a
state
does
not
have
to
reform
all
its
laws
all
at
once.
just
last
week
in
the
city
of
renton
case,
this
court
held
that
a
city
did
not
have
to
resolve
all
its
problems
with
so-called
adult
entertainment
at
the
same
time.
to
the
contrary,
the
court
said,
we
can
resolve
the
problems
posed
by
adult
theaters,
without
at
the
same
time
dealing
with
other
adult
entertainment
such
as
bookstores
and
night
clubs
and
so
forth.
and
this
case
is
similar.
pennsylvania
was
entitled
to
say
in
1984,
we
are
going
to
change
the
law
with
respect
to
tort
actions
but
we
are
not
at
this
point
going
to
deal
with
the
tougher
problem
of
paternity
actions.
as
it
turned
out,
of
course,
pennsylvania
did
deal
with
the
problem
of
paternity
actions
less
than
a
year
and
a
half
later,
because
a
year
and
a
half
later
pennsylvania
did
in
fact,
in
effect,
eliminate
the
statute
of
limitations.
let
me
turn
now
to
the
other
criteria
established
by
this
court
for
equal
protection,
and
that
is,
does
the
statute
of
limitations
provide
an
ample
opportunity
for
paternity
and
child
support
actions
to
be
brought.
again,
we
submit
that
the
six-year
statute
passes
muster.
we
believe
that
six
years
gives
an
ample
opportunity
for
the
mother
to
overcome
the
various
problems
which
might
inhibit
her
from
bringing
a
child
support
action.
first,
let's
take
a
look
at
the
financial
problems.
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania,
if
a
mother
is
on
welfare,
the
department
of
public
welfare
will
provide
legal
assistance
to
bring
a
paternity
and
a
child
support
action.
other
poor
mothers
can
use
community
legal
services
to
bring
paternity
or
child
support
actions.
i
don't
think
it
can
be
fairly
said,
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania,
that
a
mother
will
be
financially
unable
to
obtain
the
legal
assistance
that
she
needs
to
pursue
a
paternity
or
a
child
support
action
within
the
requisite
six-year
period.
now,
this
court
has
suggested
that
there
are
other
barriers
that
a
mother
may
face,
personal,
psychological
barriers
that
might
inhibit
her
from
bringing
a
suit
within
six
years.
let
me
say
first
that
there
is
little
evidence
that
there
is
a
substantial
number
of
women
who
will
not
overcome
whatever
inhibitions
they
have
within
the
six-year
period.
furthermore,
there
is
little
evidence
that--
mr.
joseph
n.
onek
--if
the
man
and
woman
are
living
together
and
the
man
is
contributing
any
support,
any
amount
of
support
for
the
child,
the
statute
isn't
running
because
the
woman
would
then
have
two
years
after
the
ceasing
of
support
to
file
it.
so,
your
hypothetical
only
exists
in
a
situation
where
the
man
and
woman
are
living
together
and
the
man
is
not
providing
a
jot
of
support
to
the
child,
which
is
a
highly
unlikely
situation.
the
father
is
paying...
or
if
the
defendant
is
even
paying
a
dollar
of
rent,
he
presumably
is
helping
to
contribute
to
the
support
of
the
child,
and
as
long
as
that
is
true
the
mother
is
not
bound
by
the
six-year
statute
of
limitations.
she
can
sue
two
years
after
the
defendant's
support
stops.
so,
i
think
that
problem,
which
was
a
very
real
problem
in
the
mills
case,
as
this
court
pointed
out,
is
not
a
problem
under
the
pennsylvania
statute.
under
the
pennsylvania
statute
that
is
not
a
problem.
so,
we
don't
think
that
there
are
going
to
be
a
great
many
women
inhibited
from
filing
within
six
years.
furthermore,
even
if
there
are
such
women,
there
may
be
some
women
who
will
not
file
at
any
time.
in
other
words,
what
evidence
is
there
that
a
woman
who
won't
file
in
six
years
will
file
in
the
interim
between
six
and
18
years?
we
have
to
recognize
the
fact
that
there
are
some
women
who
for
whatever
reason
will
not
file
the
child
support
action.
that
is
not
a
statute
of
limitations
problem.
there's
simply
nothing
in
the
statute
of
limitations--
mr.
joseph
n.
onek
--pennsylvania
changed
the
law...
the
short
answer,
i
think,
is
that
it
was
required
to
do
so
in
order
to
receive
afdc
money.
as
you
know,
in
1984
congress
enacted
a
law
which
said
that
unless
a
state
moves
to
an
18-year
statute
of
limitations,
it
would
be
deprived
of
afdc
money.
although
i
don't
know
the
exact
amount
of
afdc
money
that
pennsylvania
receives,
i
assume
that
it's
in
the
tens
or
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars.
therefore,
pennsylvania
and
i
assume
every
other
state
in
the
union
will
now
move
to
an
18-year
statute
of
limitations.
that
may
in
fact
be
a
good
policy
judgment.
all
i
am
arguing
here
is
that
the
state
of
pennsylvania
prior
to
that
was
not
required
constitutionally
to
have
an
18-year
statute,
that
it
could
have
a
six-year
statute,
and
that
such
a
statute
is
constitutional.
if
you
have
no
further
questions,
i
conclude
my
argument.
