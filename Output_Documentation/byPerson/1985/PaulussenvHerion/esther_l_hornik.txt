ms.
esther
l.
hornik
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
pennsylvania
statute
of
limitations
of
six
years
from
birth
in
a
support
action
for
illegitimate
children
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
where
no
similar
restriction
exists
in
support
actions
for
legitimate
children.
there
are
two
points
to
be
made:
first,
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
it
treats
legitimate
and
illegitimate
children
differently
without
a
substantial
state
interest
for
such
discrimination.
in
particular,
the
only
conceivable
state
interest
of
protection
from
stale
and
fraudulent
claims
is
clearly
weak.
current
scientific
procedures
are
sufficiently
precise
so
that
the
risk
of
false
paternity
charges
in
no
sense
balances
against
unfair
loss
of
support
for
illegitimate
children.
secondly,
this
case
is
not
moot.
although
current
pennsylvania
law
establishes
an
18-year
statute
of
limitations
in
response
to
federal
law,
the
law
operates
only
from
december
1st
of
1985.
pennsylvania
precedent
suggests
that
the
new
law
does
not
apply
retroactively
to
a
back
child
support
award
so
that
the
illegitimate
child
in
this
case
would
lose
all
right
to
child
support
from
the
date
of
filing
of
the
complaint
in
this
action,
february
11th
of
1980.
ms.
esther
l.
hornik
yes,
that
is
correct.
the
statute
was
enacted--
ms.
esther
l.
hornik
--if
it
did
apply
retroactively,
no,
there
would
be
no
issue.
but
pennsylvania
precedent
suggests
that
the
law--
ms.
esther
l.
hornik
--well,
actually,
no,
there's
definite
pennsylvania
precedent,
the
cases
of
williams
versus
wolfe,
hatfield
versus
hazel,
hatfield
versus--
ms.
esther
l.
hornik
--because
this
new...
the
new
statute,
the
one
that
gives
an
18-year
limitation
period,
contains
no
language
in
it
to
suggest
that
it
would
apply
retroactively.
pennsylvania
has
a
rule
of
statutory
construction
that
in
the
absence
of--
ms.
esther
l.
hornik
--no,
because
it's
already
been
decided
under
pennsylvania
precedent
that
the
law
in
existence
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
a
paternity
complaint
is
the
law
to
be
applied
in
the
case,
and
since
this
case
was
filed
in
february
of
1980,
the
law
to
be
applied
would
be
the
six-year
statute
of
limitations
that
was
in
existence
in
1980.
ms.
esther
l.
hornik
with
the
six-year,
statute,
or
with
the
18-year?
ms.
esther
l.
hornik
no,
because
it's
so
new,
it
just
became
effective
on
december
31st
of
1985.
no
court
to
my
knowledge
has
had
an
opportunity
to
review
its
implications.
ms.
esther
l.
hornik
i
believe
that
it's
more
important
for
this
court
to
make
a
determination
regarding
the
constitutionality
of
the
six-year
statute
of
limitations
that
was
in
existence
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
complaint
rather
than
sending
the
case
back
to
the
pennsylvania
court
for
a
determination
that
has
already
been
made
under
pennsylvania
precedent.
in
other
words,
in
the
hatfield
versus
hazel
baker
case,
in
the
jenner
versus
stillman
case,
and
most
particularly
the
williams
versus
wolfe
case,
the
pennsylvania
courts
have
spoken
and
said
the
appropriate...
that
the
date
of
the
filing
of
the
complaint
is
the
date--
ms.
esther
l.
hornik
--well--
ms.
esther
l.
hornik
--well,
i...
there's
one
peculiarity
of
pennsylvania
law
which
must
be
made
clear,
and
that
is
that
the
order
of
child
support
in
every
support
case
is
retroactive
to
the
date
of
the
filing
of
the
complaint,
and
so
that
in
pennsylvania--
ms.
esther
l.
hornik
--well--
ms.
esther
l.
hornik
--that's
correct,
justice
stevens,
but
since
there's
this
particular
rule
of
civil
procedure
which
states
that
an
order
of
support
is
retroactive
to
the
date
of
the
filing
of
the
complaint,
and
i
know
of
no
pennsylvania
case
in
which
child
support
was
awarded
for
a
period
prior
to
the
date
of
the
filing
of
a
child
support
complaint,
i
think
i
would
have
a
difficult
time
in
the
pennsylvania
court,
finding
a
favorable
response
to
that
argument.
ms.
esther
l.
hornik
no,
for
example--
ms.
esther
l.
hornik
--in
the
mills
case
that
was
before
you
the
same
thing
happened.
during
the
pendency
of
the
mills
case
the
texas
statute
was
changed
from
one
year
to
four
years,
and
you
decided
the
constitutionality
of
the
one-year
statute
of
limitations
in
paternity
cases
in
the
mills
case,
because
you
made
the
determination
that
the
child
in
that
case
would
not
have
gotten
the
benefit
of
the
four-year
statute
and
would
have
been
barred
from
continuing
on
in
a
paternity
case.
ms.
esther
l.
hornik
well,
in
this
case--
ms.
esther
l.
hornik
--justice
marshall,
i
believe
that
one
must
distinguish
between
the
right
to
file
a
complaint
and
the
remedy
in
this...
now,
under
the
new
statute
it's
clear
that
georgeann
would
have
the
right
to
file
a
new
paternity
and
support
petition.
that
petition...
her
award
of
child
support
would
be
retroactive
to
the
date
of
the
new
filing,
which
would
be
a
date
after
december
31st
of
1985.
her
rights
to
back
support
from
february
1980
are
jeopardized,
and
it's
an
amount--
ms.
esther
l.
hornik
--the
new
statute
is
not
in
issue
in
this
case.
this
case
falls
under
the
old
statute.
ms.
esther
l.
hornik
that's--
ms.
esther
l.
hornik
--i
believe
that
the
state
court
has
already
decided
that.
ms.
esther
l.
hornik
but
the
old
statute...
well,
okay,
the
old
statute
was
enacted
in
1978.
for
example,
in
this
case,
this
child
was
born
in
1973.
now,
in
williams
versus
wolfe
the
court
was
considering
the
retroactivity
of
a
statute
of
limitations,
and
if
you
look
at
the
facts
in
that
case
the
child
was
already
six
years
old
in
1979
when
the
complaint
was
filed.
and
so,
what
the
court
was
asking
is,
can
we
apply
a
newly
enacted
statute
of
limitations
of
six
years
to
a
case
which
has
been
filed
one
year
after
the
effective
date
of
this
act,
and
the
child
was
already
five
at
the
age
of
the
enactment
of
any
statute,
and
the
court
ruled
that
the
date
of
the
complaint
determined
the
law
that
would
be
applied
in
the
case,
not
the
date
that
the
child
was
born,
and
not
the
effective
date
of
the
act,
but
the
effective
date
that
the
complaint
was
filed.
georgeann
veronica
paulussen
was
born
on
today's
date,
march
5th,
in
1972.
at
the
time
of
georgeann's
birth
her
mother,
barbara
paulussen
and
her
putative
father,
george
ronald
herion,
were
not
married
to
each
other.
georgeann's
mother
and
father
continued
to
have
a
relationship
through
april
of
1975,
and
throughout
this
time
george
herion
made
voluntary
contributions
to
georgeann's
support,
and
then
in
april
of
1975
all
support
ceased.
barbara
paulussen
filed
a
paternity
action
on
behalf
of
georgeann
in
the
court
of
common
pleas
of
bucks
county
on
february
11th
of
1980.
in
this
complaint
george
herion
is
named
as
her
father.
george
herion
immediately
raised
at
bar
the
six-year
statute
of
limitations
to
georgeann's
claim,
pleading
that
the
case
was
filed
more
than
six
years
after
georgeann's
birth
and
more
than
two
years
after
he
had
made
voluntary
contributions
to
her
support.
there
was
no
trial
on
the
merits
of
georgeann's
claim
in
the
lower
court.
by
operation
of
law,
she
was
barred
from
presenting
her
evidence
to
a
tryer
of
fact.
her
evidence
included
results
of
red
and
white
blood
tests
in
which
samples
had
been
taken
from
her,
from
her
mother,
barbara
paulussen,
and
from
george
herion.
the
results
of
these
tests
indicated
that
there
was
a
99.8
probability
that
george
herion
was
the
father.
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment
were
filed.
the
mother's
motion
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
the
six-year
statute.
the
father's
motion
raised
the
bar
of
the
statute.
the
lower
court
granted
the
father's
motion,
george
herion,
and
denied
barbara
paulussen's
motion
thereby
dismissing
the
complaint.
the
matter
was
then
appealed
to
the
superior
court
of
pennsylvania
where
again
barbara
paulussen's
constitutional
challenge
was
denied.
a
petition
for
allowance
of
appeal
was
filed
in
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania.
it
too
was
denied
and
the
appeal
to
this
court
followed.
the
superior
court
of
pennsylvania
ruled
against
barbara
paulussen
on
the
basis
of
a
pennsylvania
precedent.
in
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
case
of
astemborski
versus
sasmalzki,
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
the
six-year
statute,
and
the
superior
court,
being
a
lower
court,
felt
compelled
to
follow
the
precedent
of
the
higher
court.
the
astemborski
case
had...
the
astemborski
court
had
initially
considered
the
constitutionality
of
the
six-year
statute.
a
petition
for
certiorari
was
granted
by
this
court,
and
then
judgment
was
vacated
and
the
case
was
remanded
back
to
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
for
consideration
in
light
of
this
court's
decision
in
pickett
versus
brown.
the
astemborski
court
reconsidered
the
constitutional
question
in
light
of
this
court's
decision
and
reaffirmed
its
original
decision,
finding
the
six-year
statute
constitutional.
in
mills,
this
court
struck
down
a
one-year
statute
of
limitations
from
texas
as
constitutionally
invalid,
and
in
pickett
a
unanimous
court
struck
down
a
two-year
statute
of
limitations
on
the
same
basis.
in
mills
and
in
pickett
this
court
established
a
two-part
test
for
analysis
of
the
constitutionality
of
a
paternity
statute
of
limitations.
there
had
to
be
an
adequate
time
frame
for
a
paternity
action
to
be
instituted
on
behalf
of
illegitimate
children.
there
had
to
be
a
substantial
state
interest
in
avoiding
stale
and
fraudulent
claims
to
justify
the
discriminatory
impact
of
this
statute
on
the
rights
of
illegitimate
children,
and
other
countervailing
state
interests.
despite
these
guidelines
for
constitutional
analysis,
the
astemborski
court
found
that
the
pennsylvania
six-year
statute
was
constitutionally
adequate.
the
holding
of
the
astemborski
court
was
in
error.
first,
is
six
years
a
constitutionally
adequate
length
of
time
to
bring
a
paternity
action?
the
answer
must
be
no.
first,
the
child,
georgeann
paulussen,
is
a
real
party
in
interest
here
although
her
mother's
name
appears
in
the
caption,
and
there
can
be
no
assurance
that
her
interest
is
identical
to
her
mother's
interest.
the
child
cannot
act
on
her
own
behalf
but
she
loses
important
rights.
she
cannot
toddle
into
court
to
find
her
daddy.
her
mother
may
be
unwilling
to
sue
in
a
timely
fashion
for
her
own
reasons,
whether
these
reasons
be
out
of
hate,
love
or
utter
indifference
to
the
father.
the
mother's
feelings
can
continue
for
many
years,
even
if
the
father
makes
voluntary
contributions
to
the
support
of
the
child
or
acknowledges
the
child's
paternity
in
writing
after
the
six-year
period.
second,
the
financial
needs
of
a
minor
child
are
not
always
predictable
before
he
or
she
is
six.
a
child
may
not
require
her
father's
financial
assistance
at
age
five,
but
at
age
12
or
age
17
may
be
in
desperate
need
of
such
assistance.
as
to
the
second
prong
of
the
test
suggested
by
this
court,
does
the
prevention
of
stale
and
fraudulent
claims
counterbalance
the
interest
of
the
child
and
the
countervailing
interest
of
the
state?
we
present
this
issue
by
issue.
is
the
prevention
of
stale
claims
really
an
issue?
no.
can
an
illegitimate
child's
claim
for
ongoing
financial
support
be
considered
stale?
the
claim
of
a
legitimate
child
is
not
considered
stale.
then,
is
the
prevention
of
fraudulent
claims
a
substantial
state
interest?
as
this
court
has
noted,
advances
in
scientific
testing
have
attenuated
the
relationship
between
the
statute
of
limitations
and
the
state's
interest
in
the
prevention
of
prosecution
of
stale
and
fraudulent
claims.
in
the
congressional
report
accompanying
the
child
support
enforcement
amendment
of
1985,
it
was
noted
that,
"increased
reliability
of
scientific
paternity
testing
can
exclude
over
99
percent
of
those
wrongfully
accused
fathers,
regardless
of
the
age
of
the
child.
"
pennsylvania
recognizes
that
the
results
of
hla
testing
are
so
reliable
that
they
can
be
introduced
as
affirmative
evidence
of
paternity
in
a
paternity
proceeding.
in
our
concern
over
the
prevention
of
fraudulent
claims,
it
should
be
recalled
that
in
addition
to
the
right
to
call
upon
powerful
scientific
tests,
the
accused
father
does
not
lose
other
defenses
in
contesting
paternity.
the
accused
father
has
the
right
to
a
jury
trial.
if
indigent,
the
accused
father
has
the
right
to
counsel.
if
indigent,
the
accused
father
has
the
right
to
free
blood
tests.
the
accused
father
has
the
right
to
have
the
petition
dismissed
immediately
if
blood
tests
and
tissue
tests
show
that
he
is
excluded
as
the
father.
if
the
father
is
not
indigent,
then
he
has
the
right
to
be
notified
that
he
can
have
counsel
at
the
proceeding
and
he
has
to
be
given
an
adequate
amount
of
time
to
secure
such
counsel.
also,
the
accused
father
can
appeal
the
lower
court
decision
on
the
basis
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
and
it's
clear
in
another
context
that
pennsylvania
recognizes
that
it
is
possible
to
establish
paternity
well
after
six
years
have
passed.
an
illegitimate
child
can
probe
paternity
after
the
father
is
dead,
for
purposes
of
intestate
succession,
if
he
or
she
can
show
paternity
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
ironically,
more
liberal
rights
are
given
to
a
child
after
the
after
the
lips
of
his
father
have
been
sealed
by
death
than
when
the
father
is
alive
to
contest
the
claim.
in
sum,
it
is
barbara
paulussen's
belief
that
the
state
interest
in
preventing
stale
and
fraudulent
claims
is
now
as
it
was
in
1980,
quite
minimal.
in
contrast
the
countervailing
state
interest
and
the
child's
interest
in
the
timely
determination
of
paternity
are
much
greater.
as
this
court
has
noted,
there
is
a
substantial
countervailing
state
interest
in
seeing
that
justice
is
done
and
genuine
claims
for
child
support
are
litigated.
this
conflicts
with
the
arbitrary
nature
of
a
limitations
period,
that
provides
no
exceptions
for
determination
of
a
child's
paternity
after
the
statutory
deadline
has
passed,
based
on
either
the
case's
unique
facts
and
circumstances,
or
the
quantity
or
quality
of
the
evidence
that
a
particular
child
can
produce
to
prove
that
a
particular
man
is
its
father.
another
countervailing
state
interest
requires
consideration
of
the
cost
benefit
of
a
statute
which
grants
financial
immunity
to
a
father
for
support
obligations
and
possibly
shifts
that
support
obligation
to
taxpayers
when
the
child's
mother
is
unable
to
support
the
illegitimate
child,
or
is
not
adequately
able
to
support
the
illegitimate
child.
ms.
esther
l.
hornik
that's
correct,
and
in
pennsylvania
a
child
beyond
the
age
of
18
has
a
right
to
ask
the
father
for
child
support
if
she
needs
money
for
college
expenses,
if
she's
impoverished
or
disabled,
and
so
that
the
right
for
a
legitimate
child
could
continue
on
throughout
the
father's
lifetime,
and
so
that
even
under
the
18-year
statute,
i
believe
that
there
is
an
equal
protection
problem.
ms.
esther
l.
hornik
justice
rehnquist,
that's
correct,
but
the
illegitimate
child
never
has
the
same
procedure
as
the
legitimate
child
because
the
illegitimate
child
has
a
two-part
procedure.
for
every
case
of
an
illegitimate
child,
you
have
to
go
through
a
paternity
proceeding
and
then
a
support
proceeding.
a
paternity
proceeding
is
a
safeguard.
if
you
can't
make
it
through
the
paternity
proceeding,
you
don't
go
on
to
the
support
proceeding.
whereas,
for
the
legitimate
child,
because
of
the
presumptions
that
operate
in
favor
of
legitimacy,
all
a
legitimate
child
has
to
do
is
say,
my
parents
were
married,
you
know,
at
the
time
i
was
conceived
or
at
the
time
i
was
born,
or
my
parents
were
married
after
i
was
born,
and
i'm
legitimate
so
i
have
the
right
to
proceed
to--
ms.
esther
l.
hornik
--well,
the
thing
is
that
the
procedure
itself
is
a
safeguard.
in
other
words,
as
long
as...
in
other
words,
the
legitimate
child
and
illegitimate
child
should
have
equal
opportunity
to
ask
for
a
father's
support,
and
if
a
legitimate
child
has
through
age
50,
to
ask
for
a
father's
support,
then
the
illegitimate
child
should
have
the
same
time
period.
however,
the
illegitimate
child
will
always
have
the
burden
of
proving
paternity.
now,
as
i
stated
before,
over
99
percent
of
fathers
today
can
be
excluded
by
tests
as
potential
fathers.
so
that
you're
looking
at
a
fractional
class
of
fathers
whose
rights
are
being
affected
here,
one
percent
are
going
to
go
to
trial.
whereas,
you
have
the
entire
class
of
illegitimates
which
is
over
18
percent
now,
of
all
births
in
the
united
states,
are
children
born
out
of
wedlock,
which
i
believe
the
last
statistic
was
that
over
700,000
children
being
born
out
of
wedlock
each
year.
finally,
the
interests
of
the
child
are
sacrificed,
and
the
interest
here...
the
child's
interests
are
paramount
and
i
think
that
that's
out
of
focus
in
the
way
that
these
cases
are
being
analyzed.
and
the
child's
interests
are
far
more
substantial
than
any
risks
associated
with
a
post-six
year
paternity
suit.
there
is
clear
discrimination
in
the
statute
against
an
illegitimate
child,
and
this
court
has
stated
very
clearly
in
many
opinions
that
there
must
be
special
concern
shown
for
an
illegitimate
child,
and
there
are
statutes
that
have
classifications
based
on
illegitimacy,
are
subject
to
a
heigtened
level
of
scrutiny,
because
an
illegitimate
child
is
not
responsible
for
his
or
her
status.
it's
the
parents
who
produced
the
child.
had
georgeann
been
considered
a
legitimate
child
on
the
date
that
her
support
petition
was
filed,
she
would
have
been
receiving
support
from
both
of
her
parents
in
accordance
with
their
means
and
needs
as
determined
by
a
court
using
a
best
interest
of
the
child
standard,
and
she
would
have
been
receiving
support
from
february
of
1980,
unlike
in
this
case
where
she
has
never
received
one
penny
of
support
from
her
father
because
she's
never
had
an
opportunity
to
litigate
the
paternity
case.
it's
also
submitted
that
georgeann's
right
to
a
determination--
ms.
esther
l.
hornik
--oh,
yes,
she
did
in
the
early
days,
but
after
her
complaint
was
filed
she
hadn't.
it's
submitted
that
georgeann's
right
to
a
determination
of
paternity
is
a
fundamental
personal
right.
this
determination
is
the
keystone
upon
which
all
of
her
rights
as
her
father's
child
depend.
ms.
esther
l.
hornik
in
my
opponent's
argument,
first
of
all
it
seems
to
be
more
like
a
due
process
argument
in
favor
of
fathers,
rather
than
the
issue
that's
before
this
court,
is
how
legitimate
children
are
treated
differently
than
illegitimate
children.
and
who
is
to
say
that
every
birth
of
every
child
is
a
planned
event?
you
can
have
families
where
the
parents
are
married
and
they
can
have
a
surprise
child,
and
then
they
have
to
plan
for
the
financial
future
of
that
child,
and
so
that,
this
kind
of
argument
that
a
father...
that
especially
a
father
who
has
been
engaging
in
sexual
relations
outside
of
the
bounds
of
matrimony
gets
financial
immunity
if
someone
happens
to
haul
him
into
court
after
six
years,
is
absurd.
now,
this
court
has
pointed
out
that
in
this
kind
of
situation
the
children's
interest...
the
child's
interest
is
paramount.
not
one
word
here
was
said
about
the
child.
what
about
the
social
embarrassment
of
the
illegitimate
child?
what
about
the
child
who
is
given
a
school
assignment
to
fill
out
his
family
tree
and
she
can
only
fill
out
one
branch,
her
mother's
side.
she
has
nothing
to
put
on
her
father's
side.
and
so
that,
an
illegitimate
child,
because
of
what
the
father
has
done,
his
irresponsibility,
is
stuck
with
the
consequences
and
if
you
can
follow
that
argument,
that
the
statute
of
limitations
is
supposed
to
work
as
a
statute
of
repose
for
the
father,
it's
plainly
unfair
and
doesn't
balance
against
the
interests
of
the
child.
in
closing,
i
would
like
to
state
that
this
statute
of
limitations
is
a
violation
of
the
due
process...
pardon
me,
of
the
right
to
equal
protection
of
an
illegitimate
child,
and
i
would
urge
this
court
to
find
the
six-year
statute
of
limitations
unconstitutional,
and
reverse
the
superior
court
of
pennsylvania.
thank
you.
