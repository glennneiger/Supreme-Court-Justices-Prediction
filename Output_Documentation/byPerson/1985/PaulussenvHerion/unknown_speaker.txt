mrs.
hornik,
may
i
ask,
that
statute
was
enacted
since
this
case
was
decided
below?
unknown
speaker
well,
suggests,
you
say?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
just
wondered
if
we
ought
not
to...
why
should
we
address
this
issue
if
in
fact
a
new
statute
applies
to
this
case?
why
shouldn't
we
send
it
back
to
find
out?
unknown
speaker
well,
my
only
suggestion
is,
wouldn't
the
pennsylvania
courts
be
better
able
to...
more
qualified
to
address
this
application
than
we
are?
unknown
speaker
and
has
the...
the
courts
of
pennsylvania,
in
any
case
other
than
yours
here,
dealt
with
this
statute?
unknown
speaker
the
18-year.
unknown
speaker
well,
as
justice
brennan
has
suggested,
can
you
suggest
a
reason
why
the
pennsylvania
courts
shouldn't
deal
with
this
first
before
we
undertake
to
do
something,
just
as
a
matter
of
policy
and
practice
if
nothing
else?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
there
must
at
least
be
an
arguable
position
to
the
contrary?
are
you
willing
to
concede
on
behalf
of
your
client
that
it
does
not
apply?
i
hope
you
won't,
but--
unknown
speaker
--i
understand.
you're
making
the
argument
against
the
statute
applying.
it
seems
to
me
if
you
were
really
put
to
the
test
you
might
come
up
with
some
arguments
for
the
other
position,
wouldn't
you?
unknown
speaker
after
all,
you're
representing
a
client
here.
you're
not
trying
to
get
a
constitutional
issue
decided.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
why
we
can't
allow
the
state
of
pennsylvania
to
interpret
its
own
laws.
isn't
that
what
we
normally
do?
unknown
speaker
well,
tell
me
where
we
didn't.
unknown
speaker
it's
a
little
different.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
didn't
suggest
that.
i
suggested
that
we
send
this
case
back,
not
the
new
case.
unknown
speaker
we
send
it
back...
well,
who
decides
whether
it
is
under
this
statute
or
the
old
one?
unknown
speaker
under
the
old
statute?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
i
take
it
you
would
make
the
same
argument
whatever
the
statutory
period
is?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
there
is
an
important
issue
in
the
case
of
the
illegitimate
child,
is
the
question
of
paternity,
and
with
your
legitimate
child
you
generally
don't
have
that
issue.
all
you're
talking
about
is,
how
much
does
the
father
make
and
what
are
the
needs
of
the
child.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
was
really
my
point,
that
there
is
this
separate
issue
in
the
case
of
the
illegitimate
child
that
might
justify
a
state
in
treating
that
sort
of
issue
and
the
time
you
can
raise
it
differently,
and
all
you're
arguing
about,
really,
are
the
assets
of
the
father
and
the
needs
of
the
child.
unknown
speaker
well,
when
you
say
that,
i
thought
she
had
received
some
support
from
her
father
in
the
early
days.
unknown
speaker
but
you
think
the
law
of
pennsylvania
is
as
your
opponent
has
stated
it?
unknown
speaker
and
if
a
new
action
were
filed,
is
the
law
settled
that
the
pennsylvania
courts
would
not
permit
recoveries
for
that
interval
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
new
paternity--
unknown
speaker
mr.
onek,
incidentally,
is
there
much
argument
here
that
this
is
the
father
of
the
child?
unknown
speaker
it
has
always
been
denied?
unknown
speaker
on
the
other
hand,
i
take
it
he
has
contributed
to
the
support?
unknown
speaker
if
i
might
interrupt,
to
get
back
to
that
question
of
whether
or
not
he
has
ever
contributed
support,
was
there
a
finding,
a
judicial
finding,
that
he
had?
unknown
speaker
but
is
it
not
true
that
there's
an
allegation
that
he
did
support--
unknown
speaker
--on
the
face
of
the
complaint?
unknown
speaker
he
did
concede,
as
i
understand
it,
that
he
is
potentially
liable
to
pay
the
child
support
today?
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
be
sure
i
understand
your
reference
to
the
scientific
tests.
do
you
acknowledge,
that
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
the
test
is
accurate?
unknown
speaker
ten
percent?
unknown
speaker
but
in
the
other
90
percent,
as
i
understand,
the
range
is
from
90
to
something
higher?
unknown
speaker
so
that,
it's
not
one
out
of
ten,
it's...
i
mean,
there's
nine
chances
out
of
ten
you'll
be
in
a
predictable
group?
unknown
speaker
then
if
you're
in
that
group,
the
chances
are
ten
to
one
that
they
can
identify--
unknown
speaker
--may
i
ask
again,
is
it
possible...
i
gather
the
pennsylvania
statute
in
effect
treated
these
as
two
kinds
of
claims,
those
in
which
there
had
been
no
support
at
all,
the
flat
six
years,
and
the
second
category
is
one
in
which
there
would
be
a
finding
there
had
been
support
for
a
period
of
time.
and
they
allege
that
they're
in
the
second
category.
do
you
think
your
argument
applies
with
the
same
force
in
that
category
as--
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
in
light
of
the
federal
requirements
today,
there
is
hardly
any
state
that
isn't
going
to
an
18-year--
unknown
speaker
your
argument
may
fall
on
deaf
ears
for
the
most
part
because
states
just
aren't
going
for
the
shorter
time
period?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
could
happen
under
the
'85
statute,
couldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
onek,
you
draw
a
distinction
between
the
six-year
statute
here
and
the
one
and
two
year
statutes
have
been
stricken
down.
where
is
the
dividing
line,
five,
four,
three?
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
a
slippery
slope.
we
have
the
same
problem
with
the
six-man
jury
case--
unknown
speaker
--in
the
pickett
case,
mr.
onek,
the
court
looked
at
the
incongruity
of
a
longer
statute
of
limitations
in
the
event
of
the
death
of
the
father,
and
recovery
by
the
illegitimate
child,
and
that
same
peculiarity
or
incongruity
exists
in
pennsylvania,
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
interrupt.
maybe
your
argument
is
valid,
because
you
are
arguing
as
of
the
time
the
statute
was
passed.
but
that
risk
is
available
now,
and
now
we're
only
talking
about
past
due
support
obligations?
unknown
speaker
supposing
that
were
the
only
state
interest
that
supported
the
statute.
i'm
not
suggesting
it
is,
and
if
that
state
interest
is
no
longer
viable
because
of
the
change
in
law,
would
that
be
a
proper
ground
on
which
to
uphold
an
otherwise
discriminatory
statute?
unknown
speaker
even
if
there's
no
longer
any
state
interest
to
justify
the
discrimination?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
the
concern
is
with
the
person
who
is
living
with
the
father
out
of
wedlock
and
doesn't
want
to
interrupt
that
ongoing
relationship
by
bringing
action
against
him.
there's
an
allegation
of
that
sort
of
situation
in
the
carey
case.
unknown
speaker
then
why
in
the
world
did
pennsylvania
change
its
law?
