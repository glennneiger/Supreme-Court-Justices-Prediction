justice
jr.
mr.
harper,
the
florida
supreme
court
found,
and
this
is
on
page
50
of
the
joint
appendix,
appellant
admits
that
his
attorney
voiced
but
a
single
objection
to
the
prosecutor's
closing
arguments,
and
that
it
was
not
directed
to
any
of
the
alleged
inflammatory
matter,
and
that
his
attorney
waited
until
the
fifth
objection...
a
fifth
occasion
to
object
at
all.
justice
jr.
do
we
have
to
disregard
that?
justice
jr.
but
they
were...
accepted
by
the
district
court.
