we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
darden
against
wainwright.
mr.
harper,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
--your
point
is
that
that
is
an
unconstitutional...
that
argument
rises
to
the
level
of
a
constitutional
standard.
chief
justice
burger
the
argument
that
he
shouldn't
have
been
let
out
of
the
prison
before,
and
that
if
he
is
let
out
again,
he
might
be
out
on
the
public,
do
you
say
that
is
an
improper,
impermissible
argument
constitutionally?
chief
justice
burger
constitutionally
impermissible?
that
is
my
question.
chief
justice
burger
improper
may
be
one
thing--
chief
justice
burger
--as
a
matter
of
good
taste.
is
it
constitutionally
impermissible
to
point
those
things
out?
chief
justice
burger
when
was
this
crime
committed?
chief
justice
burger
1973.
chief
justice
burger
so
you
think
it
is
constitutionally
impermissible
for
a
lawyer
in
the
courtroom
to
criticize
the
system
of
justice
that
lets
this
kind
of
a
matter
run
that
long?
constitutionally
impermissible
for
a
member
of
the
executive
branch,
as
you
put
it--
chief
justice
burger
--the
prosecutor
to
be
critical
of
the
system
of
justice
that
takes
13
years
to
get
something
completed?
chief
justice
burger
did
you
say
it
is
the
third
time
it
has
been
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
prospect.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
harper?
chief
justice
burger
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
the
failure
of
an
objection?
is
that
correct...
the
objection?
chief
justice
burger
what
does
the
transcript
of
the
trial
show
with
respect
to
an
objection?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
