justice
rehnquist
what
is
wrong
with
that
sort
of
an
argument,
counsel?
i
mean,
the
prosecutor
has
got
to
say
something.
justice
rehnquist
is
there
some
constitutional
standard
of
propriety
that
you
see
in
our
cases?
justice
rehnquist
you
say,
then,
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
prohibits
a
prosecutor
in
a
death
case
from
saying
to
the
jury,
members
of
the
jury,
it
might
have
been
you
who
was
killed?
justice
rehnquist
but
i
take
it,
though,
that
is
what
you
are
saying.
justice
rehnquist
and
you
say
it
is
unconstitutional
for
him
to
say
that.
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
you
started
out
ticking
off
your
claims
as
to
how
this
prosecutor
had
fallen
short,
and
i
thought
the
first
one
you
gave
was,
he
said
to
the
members
of
the
jury,
this
might
have
been
you.
now,
surely
you
meant
that
to
have
a
constitutional
dimension,
didn't
you?
justice
rehnquist
well,
how...
you--
justice
rehnquist
well,
murphy
was
sitting
there
while
the
judge
had
made
his
introductory
statements
in
that
regard,
wasn't
he?
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
if
there
is
a
debate
on
that,
i
think
that
our
cases
on
federal
habeas
review
say
that
you
presume
the
judge
applied
the
correct
standard.
