was
this
the
issue
before
us
when
it
was
here
before?
justice
white
and
that
is
when
you
were
here
before?
justice
white

it
was
just
a

no
opinion?
justice
white
what
about
the
testimony
of
the
lawyer
at
the
habeas

justice
white
did
they
claim
they
objected?
justice

what
was
a
tactical
decision?
justice

so
there
was

that
there
was
no
