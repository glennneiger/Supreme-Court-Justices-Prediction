mr.
robert
a.
harper,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
prosecutor's
closing
argument
in
the
willie
jasper
darden
prosecution
during
the
final
summary
has
been
variously
described
as
bad,
as
unfair,
as
harmful,
as
prejudicial,
as
egregious,
but
there
is
one
word
only
that
is
sufficient
to
describe
this
argument
in
this
case,
and
that
is
reversal.
the
question
then
arises
as
to
why
the
case
hasn't
been
reversed
and
why
is
it
here.
and
the
simple
answer
is,
the
eleventh
circuit
has
not
and
did
not
apply
the
appropriate
standard
announced
in
caldwell
versus
mississippi.
on
the
same
date
that
the
darden
case
came
down
en
banc
from
the
eleventh
circuit,
july
the
23rd,
1985,
that
court
decided
tucker
versus
kemp,
brooks
v.
kemp,
and
william
tucker
versus
kemp.
the
tucker
case
has
been
vacated
and
remanded
under
the
caldwell
decision.
we
raised
caldwell
in
the
petition
for
rehearing
which
was
denied...
that
opinion
is
found
in
the
joint
appendix
at
395...
when
less
than
a
majority
of
the
court
voted
in
favor
of
the
petition
for
rehearing.
the
eleventh
circuit
is
squarely
faced
and
apparently
rejected
the
caldwell
standard,
and
we
would
submit
that
in
view
of
the
dissents,
two
dissents
in
the
en
banc
opinion
on
the
27th
of
august,
that
a
remand
would
be
inaccurate,
and
that
an
outright
reversal
is
required.
this
argument
is
so
bad
it
has
been
universally
condemned.
it
is
so
bad,
as
the
district
judge
noted,
even
the
state
has
not
even
weakly
asserted
anything
but
that
it
is
improper.
the
reviewing
courts,
each
and
every
one,
starting
with
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
found
that
the
prosecutor's
remarks
under
ordinary
circumstances
would
constitute
a
violation
of
the
code
of
professional
responsibility.
two
justices
of
the
florida
supreme
court,
former
chief
justices
each,
described
the
remarks,
as
vituperative
personal
remarks
upon
the
accused
and
appeals
to
passions
and
prejudice.
the
magistrate
who
heard
the
evidence
at
the
evidentiary
hearing
below
was
"convinced
that
the
jury
deliberation
was
substantially
influenced
by
the
prejudicial
argument.
"
the
eleventh...
excuse
me.
the
united
states
district
judge
who
had
a
de
novo
hearing
on
the
issue
said
no
one
even
weakly
suggested
that
the
prosecutors'
closing
remarks
were
anything
but
improper.
the
eleventh
circuit
said
that
anyone
attempting
a
textbook
illustration
of
a
violation
of
the
code
of
professional
responsibility
could
not
possibly
improve
upon
the
example
provided
by
the
prosecution
during
darden's
trial.
we
submit
that
this
case
would
be
universally
applauded
by
the
organized
bar,
and
no
concept
should
be
indulged
to
deflect
from
the
fact
that
the
sentencer
in
this
capital
case
was
diverted
from
his
truthfinding
function.
the
purpose
of
the
code
of
professional
responsibility
is
universally
accepted
by
every
practicing
attorney
and
judge.
the
purpose
of
the
rules
is
to
protect
the
due
process
rights
to
a
fair
trial.
these
standards
are
objective,
and
we
submit
that
these
standards
are
the
litmus
against
which
this
prosecutor's
argument
should
be
tested,
and
we
submit
that
this
test
in
the
search
for
the
ever
elusive
concept
called
justice
would
require
that
this
trial,
these
proceedings
be
reversed.
against
this
test,
every
reviewing
court,
all
the
parties
in
the
litigation
concede
that
the
argument
is
improper.
the
only
problem
is,
the
standard
appropriate
in
this
instance
has
not
been
applied.
the
argument
itself
comprises
44
pages
in
which
27
improper
arguments
are
interjected.
there
are
ten
attacks
on
the
credibility
of
the
criminal
justice
system
itself,
attacks
on
the
department
of
corrections,
attacks
on
the
parole
people
for
turning
this
man
loose,
and
the
like,
nine
instances
of
personal
opinion,
two
instances
of
bolstering
the
argument,
two
outright
misstatements,
one
interjection
of
race,
and
one
attack
on
specific...
well,
actually
two
attacks
on
specific
rights.
in
the
order
that
they
occur,
the
arguments
start
off
with
entreaties
to
the
effect,
"it
could
have
been
you,
members
of
the
jury,
who
had
been
murdered.
"
arguments
that
i
am
convinced--
mr.
robert
a.
harper,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
he
does
have
to
say
something,
but
i
think
it
has
to
be
proper.
mr.
robert
a.
harper,
jr.
yes,
sir,
particularly
in
a
death
case.
i
think
that
there...
the...
when
you
inflame
the
passions
of
the
jury
and
divert
them
from
the
issue
at
hand,
be
it
guilt
or
be
it
punishment,
and
interject
things
like--
mr.
robert
a.
harper,
jr.
--well,
that
is
just
one
of
the
first
instances.
mr.
robert
a.
harper,
jr.
that
is
one
thing
he
said.
yes,
your
honor.
and
i--
mr.
robert
a.
harper,
jr.
--what
i
am
saying
more
particularly
is
unconstitutional
is,
there
should
be
another
defendant
in
this
courtroom,
but
alas,
i
know
of
no
charges
to
bring
against--
mr.
robert
a.
harper,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
that
golden
rule
argument,
i
was
saying...
what
i
have
said
was,
there
were
27
instances
of
misconduct.
mr.
robert
a.
harper,
jr.
and
not
all
of
them
maybe
rise
to
the
constitutional
level.
i
have
some
that
i
believe
do
as
opposed
to
that
one,
and
others
that
i
think
are
stronger.
"the
other
defendant
should
be
the
division
of
corrections.
"
i
think,
is
stronger.
"i
wish
the
persons
responsible
for
him
being
on
the
public
were
in
the
doorway
and
shot
instead
of
the
victim,
mr.
turman.
"
i
think
arguments
like,
he,
darden,
is
a
prisoner.
"mr.
turman...
that
unknown
defendant,
namely,
the
department
of
corrections,
is
criminally
negligent.
"
"and
i
will
tell
you
this.
"
"i
will
guarantee
you
that
if
i
were
in
the
same
chair
as
mr.
darden,
i
would
lie
between
my
teeth.
"
me,
the
elected
official
of
which
probably
a
majority
of
that
jury
voted
for.
and
i
think
there
are
other
arguments
that
get
even
worse.
"i
have
no
contact
with
this
case,
but
sometime
it
emotionally
gets
to
me.
"
"there
is
one
person
on
trial,
he,
willie
darden,
and
his
keepers.
"
i
think
those
are
the
kinds
of
things
that
reach
constitutional
dimension,
your
honor.
and
i
think
it
goes
further
when
he
says
that
he,
darden,
says
he
asked
for
a
polygraph.
"only
an
incompetent
lawyer
would
allow
him
to
take
a
polygraph.
"
mr.
goodwill,
the
defense
lawyer,
"you
didn't
give
my
shells
back.
"
and
these
kind
of
conducts
against
this
lawyer,
slamming
stuff
around,
berating
in
front
of
the
jury,
parading
in
front
of
the
jury,
putting
the
credibility
of
the
office
of
the
state
attorney,
an
elected
official
under
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
florida,
in
issue
time
and
time
again.
"i
believe
willie
darden
is
a
murderer.
"
"i
will
believe
that
the
rest
of
my
life.
"
that
kind
of
argument,
i
submit,
your
honor,
rises
to
the
level
of
a
constitutional
violation
under
any
standard,
and
in
particular
the
caldwell
standard,
which
was
not
addressed
and
has
not
been
addressed
by
any
reviewing
court
today.
those
are
not
the
only
instances
of
misconduct,
however,
and
as
i
admit,
there
are
more
and
more,
and
it
builds
up
time
and
time
and
time
again,
and
the
thing...
"the
department
of
corrections
turned
him
loose
on
the
public.
"
"can
we
expect
them
to
stay
in
prison
when
they
go
there?
"
"can't
we
expect
them
to
stay
locked
up
once
they
get
there?
"
"he
shouldn't
be
out
of
his
cell
unless
he
has
a
leash
on
him.
"
these
are
the
kind
of
things,
your
honor,
that
are
not
just
isolated.
they
are
persistent
time
and
time
and
time
again.
"yes,
there
is
another
defendant,
but
i
regret
i
know
of
no
charge
to
place
upon
him
except
the
public
condemnation.
"
"condemn
them.
"
"condemn
the
department
of
corrections
by
putting
willie
jasper
darden
in
the
electric
chair.
"
is
what
that
prosecutor
is
saying.
"he
is
a
prisoner.
"
"he
is
supposed
to
be.
"
"mr.
turman
is
dead
because
of
that
unknown
defendant,
the
department
of
corrections.
"
"we
don't
have
in
the
courtroom
allow
it.
"
"we,
the
department
of
corrections,
is
criminally
negligent
for
allowing
it.
"
those
kind
of
arguments,
i
submit,
your
honor,
rise
to
constitutional
question.
it
is
a
direct
attack
on
the
reliability
of
the
criminal
justice
system
itself.
here
is
the
executive
branch
challenging
another
branch
of
the
government,
making
attacks,
personal
attacks
on
counsel
in
the
courtroom,
and
then
going
through
things
like,
well,
counsel
is
going
to
say...
try
the
sheriff's
department.
well,
he
has
got
notes
that
i
gave
years
ago,
and
i
used
to
be
a
defense
lawyer
myself,
nine
years.
and
that
is
not
the
only
thing,
he
asked.
and
i
think
the
biggest
thing
about
the
argument
is,
he
gave
one
argument...
they
gave
one
argument,
44
pages,
27
incidences
of
misconduct,
and
during
that
time
he
says,
"i
guarantee
you
i
will
ask
for
death.
"
"there
is
no
question
about
it.
"
the
second
part
of
the
trial,
"i
will
request
you
to
impose
the
death
penalty.
"
"i
will
ask
you
to
advise
the
judge.
"
"that
is
the
only
way
i
know
he
is
not
going
to
get
out
on
the
public.
"
"that
is
the
only
way
i
know.
"
"it
is
the
only
way
i
can
be
sure.
"
"it
is
the
only
way
anybody
can
be
sure,
because
the
people
that
turned
him
loose.
"
and
those
arguments,
i
submit
to
you,
rise
to
a
constitutional
question.
mr.
robert
a.
harper,
jr.
i
am
sorry,
sir?
mr.
robert
a.
harper,
jr.
your
honor,
future
dangerousness
is
a
different
issue
from
what
i
am
trying
to
say
is
overall,
considering
the
total
circumstances
of
a
racially
charged
courtroom
setting
in
a
rural
area
of
mid-florida
in
1973,
where
the
prosecutor
entreats
the
jury
during
voir
dire
that,
can
you
try
willie
darden
as
if
he
was
white,
then
saying
that
their
particular
argument,
that,
you
know,
there
are
particular
words
that
are
permissible,
but
they
are
included
in
the
context
of
impermissible
argument.
i
think
future
dangerousness
is
a
permissible
argument,
but
to
say
that
the
only
way
i
know
that
you
can
protect
the
public
is
to...
and
the
negligent
people
that
turned
him
loose,
to
make
sure
it
doesn't
happen
again,
i
don't
think
that
is
proper.
mr.
robert
a.
harper,
jr.
your
honor--
mr.
robert
a.
harper,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
robert
a.
harper,
jr.
i
think
there
are
certain
segments
of
the
argument
that
pass
constitutional
muster,
but
considering
the
argument
as
a
whole,
the
calculated
and
designed
effect
it
had
to
inflame
the
jury,
it
was
a
model
in
its
total
context.
it
was
designed
and
did,
i
believe,
violate
every
single
article
of
the
code
of
professional
responsibility.
mr.
robert
a.
harper,
jr.
this
crime
was
committed
on
september
the
8th,
1973.
mr.
robert
a.
harper,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
harper,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
harper,
jr.
your
honor,
it
wasn't
13
years
old
when
he
said
that.
the
trial,
of
course,
was
four
months
later
from
the
crime.
the
crime
was
committed
on
september
the
8th,
1973.
the
trial
was
january
the
17th,
1974.
as
far
as
this
trial,
this
proceeding
dragging
on
this
long,
if
that
is
the
question
you
are
putting
to
me,
your
honor,
my
position
is
that
i
am
sworn
to
defend
a
person's
rights
as
long
as
he
has
those
rights.
in
this
case,
willie
jasper
darden,
he
will
not
die
because
of
these
rights
he
has,
and
these
rights
we
have
been
asserting
the
last
eight
years
that
i
have
been
working
on
this
case
pro
bono
have
been
reevaluated
at
least
three
times
by
this
court.
all
three
issues
we
have
filed
have
been
reevaluated,
and
the
only
thing
that
has
changed
in
willie
darden's
case
is
not
the
facts,
but
the
way
we
have
had
to
plead
in
ours,
and
the
way
we
have
had
to
try
to
get
the
courts
below
to
apply
the
standards
that
you
have
set
out.
our
case
has
been,
i
think,
very
active,
and
it
was
visited
by
the
en
banc
eleventh
circuit
four
times.
mr.
robert
a.
harper,
jr.
yes,
sir.
yes,
sir,
it
is
the
third
time
here,
but
i
think
it
is
appropriate
to
say
that
the
issues
are
more
ripe
now.
the
magistrate
made
certain
findings
below,
and
the
district
judge
made
findings
below
that
make
things
ripe
in
the
sense
of
this.
there
are
historical
findings
that
have
been
made
that
are
important
by
the
judge
below
which
are
now
reviewed
under
a
clearly
erroneous
standard,
and
i
think
those
findings,
those
types
of
things
solidify
the
rights
of
willie
darden
to
the
relief
that
we
are
requesting.
and
that
isn't
the
only
issue
in
the
case.
the
exclusion
of
murphy,
venirium
in
murphy,
i
think,
is
a
perfectly
viable
issue.
it
certainly
falls
short
of
the
breadth
of
lockhart,
but
is
as
viable
an
alternative
to
the
relief
that
we
request
on
the
argument.
mr.
murphy
was
clearly
excluded
applying
the
wrong
standard
of
law.
he
was
not
questioned
under
the
adams
standard,
and
i
think
it
is
appropriate
to
review
the
case
and
reverse
the
case
on
that
issue
by
itself.
mr.
robert
a.
harper,
jr.
your
honor,
that
cannot
be
gleaned
from
the
record,
and
i
would
submit,
justice
rehnquist,
that
a
contrary
inference
could
be
drawn
from
the
record.
the
appendix
at
page
5,
the
transcript
at
page
6,
the
judge
says,
"all
right,
at
this
time
we
will
take
a
recess
for
ten
minutes.
"
"i
would
like
you
all
back
in
the
courtroom
to
proceed
with
the
selection
of
the
jury.
"
one
of
the
jurors
said,
"beg
your
pardon,
sir?
"
"she
was
talking,
and
i
couldn't
hear
what
you
said.
"
i
don't
think
you
can
conclude
from
the
record
that
mr.
murphy
heard.
mr.
robert
a.
harper,
jr.
yes,
sir,
but
i
don't
think
that
presumption
can
apply
in
this
case,
and
the
reason
i
say
that
are
two.
the
findings
are
not
fairly
supported
by
the
record,
and
there
was
an
inadequate
development
of
the
material
facts,
and
i
think
that
the
presumption
of
correctness
that
has
been
announced,
and
which
really
is
not
new
law,
but
just
a
new
enunciation
of
the
proceedings
under
254(b).
mr.
robert
a.
harper,
jr.
only
of
the
death
penalty,
your
honor.
if
it
please,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
be
willing
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
at
this
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
a.
harper,
jr.
yes,
sir,
your
honor.
the
state
would
apparently
have
mr.
darden
come
forward
showing
some
prejudice
by
this
argument.
in
other
words,
place
some
burden
of
showing
on
us
which
is
the
standard
adopted
by
the
eleventh
circuit.
we
would
submit
that
it
is
more
appropriate
that
the
standard
is
on
the
state
to
show
that
there
was
a
likelihood
of
harm
from
this
prejudicial
argument.
it
is
our
position
that
this
trial,
the
system
itself
broke
down.
unlike
caldwell,
where
the
judge
actively
intervened
and
made
a
proper
instruction,
the
judge
was
quiet
and
didn't
say
anything.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
there
were
what
has
been
categorized
as
tentative,
a
weak
objection,
the
judge
in
one
instance
overruled
it,
and
in
the
other
instance
said,
proceed
with
the
case.
mr.
robert
a.
harper,
jr.
the
magistrate
found
there
was
an
objection,
firstly,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
what
was
at...
it
is
in
the
appendix
at
page
240...
excuse
me,
the
appendix
at
214,
late
and
tentative.
i
would
submit
that
finding
of
fact
is
reviewable
under
the
clearly
erroneous
standard.
the
district
judge,
however,
said
that
the
state
decision
was
rendered
by
the
supreme
court
to
entertain
fair
trial
on
the
merits
and
pronouncements.
mr.
robert
a.
harper,
jr.
your
honor,
in
my
opinion
it
shows
defense
counsel
alternatively
rising
to
object
to
the
argument
in
two
separate
instances.
mr.
robert
a.
harper,
jr.
one...
the
second
objection
was...
that
is
about
the
fifth
time
the
state
has
said
he
wished
the
defendant
would
kill
himself.
and
the
first
objection
was
to
the
evidence.
but
the
second
objection,
i
think,
was
clearly
to
the
improper
argument.
but
as
to
this
prejudice
showing,
i
think
it
is
important
to
note
that
the
jury
even
in
this
case
was
split,
and
if
there
is
such
universal
accord
on
the
death
penalty
being
appropriate...
even
in
the
face
of
this
argument
there
was
a
split
verdict...
i
think
there
is
some...
that
is
some
showing,
at
least,
that
the
reliability
of
the
outcome
has
been
infringed
upon.
mr.
robert
a.
harper,
jr.
i
read
it
to
mean
that
there
was
an
objection,
albeit
late,
albeit
a
little
weak,
but
there
was
an
objection.
mr.
robert
a.
harper,
jr.
well,
there
are
two
lawyers
who
have
testified
there,
of
course,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
harper,
jr.
one
said...
yes,
sir.
there
was
a
conflict
in
the
testimony
between
those
two
lawyers.
just
one
of
them
said
co-counsel,
mr.
goodwill,
was
too
intoxicated
to
show
up,
and
i
had
to
go
to
court
one
day.
there
was
a
conflict
on
that
testimony.
there
was
a
conflict
on
the
testimony
about
the
objection.
one
said
we
didn't
know
about
it.
the
other
one
said
it
was
a
tactical
decision.
but
in
any
event,
i
would
submit--
mr.
robert
a.
harper,
jr.
--the
not
objecting
was--
mr.
robert
a.
harper,
jr.
--there
was
an
objection
that
he
withheld
objection
until
a
later
point,
your
honor.
it
was
not
testimony
there
was
no
objection,
that
early
objections
were
withheld.
mr.
robert
a.
harper,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
harper,
jr.
well,
sir,
i
think
there
are
two
answers
to
that.
first
of
all,
the
magistrate
has
made
findings
now
that
we
are
in
federal
habeas
proceedings.
secondly--
mr.
robert
a.
harper,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
yes,
sir.
and
secondly,
we
have
the
supreme
court
of
florida
in
any
event
reaching
the
merits
of
the
issue,
clearly.
and
thirdly,
that
is
an
alternative
ground...
the
supreme
court
never
said
we
are
applying
the
procedural
bar.
they
in
footnotes
site
jones
v.
state,
but
they
don't
say
we
are
applying
a
procedural
bar,
and
indeed
they
can,
but
because
counsel
didn't
object,
it
triggered
a
rule
in
florida
that
this
case
would
have
to
be
reviewed
under
a
fundamental
error
standard,
under
state
law.
it
is
reviewable
without
objection,
and
it
had
to
be
reviewed
by
the
supreme
court
under
the
death
penalty
statute.
the
total
record
had
to
be
anyway.
so,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
had
reached
the
merits
under
either
one
of,
whether
there
was
or
wasn't
an
objection.
they
had
to
and
did
reach
the
merits
of
the
issue.
the
witherspoon
argument
rebuttal
reply
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
the
appendix
failed
to
pick
up
the
next
line
after
the
excusal
of
juror
murphy,
and
that
is
at
page...
let's
see,
page
9.
it
says,
"all
right,
sir,
you
will
be
excused.
"
"murphy
then
left
the
box.
"
in
the
trial
transcript,
page
165,
the
very
next
line
is
the
judge
saying,
ms.
horne>
["],
the
court
reporter,
"you
will
please
note
an
objection
for
cause
by
counsel.
"
and
i
would
submit
that
the
trial
judge
himself
enunciating
that
objection
into
the
record
is
all
that
is
necessary.
i
don't
think
that
an
experienced
trial
lawyer
in
florida
is
going
to
say,
oh,
yes,
sir,
your
honor,
and
in
addition
to
that
objection
for
cause
i
would
like
to
explain
further
an
additional
grounds,
i
think
the
trial
lawyers
would
say
when
a
judge
says
your
objection
is
noted,
that
is
the
end
of
it,
and
when
the
judge
said,
your
objection
for
cause
is
noted...
it
didn't
say
your
objection,
it
said
an
objection
for
cause
is
noted...
that
is
all
that
is
necessary,
and
a
lawyer
owes
his
respect
to
a
court
to
say
nothing,
and
i
think
that
is
what
happened
here.
it
is
there,
and
that
is
my
rebuttal
and
reply.
thank
you.
