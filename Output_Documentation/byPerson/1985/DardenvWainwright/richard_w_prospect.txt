mr.
richard
w.
prospect
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
with
regards
to
the
first
remarks
that
mr.
harper
made,
i
would
like
to
relate
to
the
court
historically
that
nine
years
ago
when
we
argued
this
case
another
lawyer
appeared
on
behalf
of
mr.
darden
and
gave
essentially
the
same
attack
on
the
statements
of
the
prosecutor.
nothing
obviously
has
changed.
the
remarks
have
remained
the
same
for
the
past
13
years.
the
attacks
have
remained
the
same,
and
judicial
treatments
and
considerations
of
the
propriety
of
those
remarks
have
likewise
remained
the
same.
the
only
thing
that
has
changed
between
nine
years
ago
and
now
is
the
federal
hearing
we
had
in
1979
in
district
court.
nine
years
ago
i
stood
here
and
told
you
that
although
the
remarks
were
indeed
improper
and
no
thinking
person
could
ever
hope
to
defend
them
either
singularly
or
collectively,
there
was
something
that
i
thought
was
very
compelling
about
the
case,
and
that
was
the
lack
of
objection.
there
was
no
objection
to
the
particular
alleged
inflammatory
remarks.
at
that
time,
i
knew
only
that
there
was
no
objection,
but
by
virtue
of
the
federal
hearing,
i
know
why,
and
the
court
knows
now
why
there
was
no
such
objection.
the
lead
defense
counsel
for
mr.
darden,
mr.
goodwill,
testified
at
the
federal
hearing
which,
if
i
may
digress
for
a
moment,
the
federal
hearing
was
held
for
the
sole
purpose
of
determining
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim.
as
a
major
premise
of
that
challenge,
the
defense
intended
to
develop
the
reason
for
failure
to
object.
it
was
their
legal
position
that
the
failure
to
object
to
these
arguments
represented
and
constituted
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
now,
obviously,
mr.
goodwill
had
to
testify
that
there
was
no
objection,
but
he
gave
as
his
reason
the
fact
that
apparently
he
and
the
prosecutor
were
old
friends.
they
had
gone
to
law
school
together,
and
they
had
known
each
other
approximately
13
years.
when
i
asked
him
directly
why
there
was
no
objection,
he
stated
that
because
of
his
prior
acquaintance
with
the
prosecutor
and
by
having
cases
against
him
and
knowing
him
as
a
lawyer,
he
was
confident
that
his
remarks,
if
left
unchecked,
would
rise
to
a
level
which
would
represent
reversible
error
without
the
need
of
objection.
now,
this
question
that
i
asked
of
the
gentleman
was
specifically
responsive
to
the
testimony
presented
on
behalf
of
the
defense
at
the
federal
hearing
from
the
other
lawyer,
the
junior
attorney
who
was
newly
admitted
to
the
bar
who
was
assisting
mr.
goodwill.
his
name
was
maloney.
mr.
maloney
said
the
reason
there
was
no
objection
was
because
he
didn't
know
anything
that
the
prosecutor
was
saying
was
objectionable.
mr.
goodwill
contradicted
that,
and
specifically
added
that
at
one
point
in
the
closing
argument
mr.
maloney
arose
as
if
to
object
and
he
physically
restrained
him.
now,
this
was
sworn
testimony
before
a
federal
magistrate.
in
this
particular
regard,
even
the
magistrate,
the
one
person
who
mr.
darden
relied
so
heavily
upon,
made
a
finding
of
fact
after
hearing
testimony.
he
rejected
obviously
mr.
maloney's
testimony
and
accepted
as
a
finding
of
historical
fact
that
the
lack
of
objection
was
due
to
deliberate
tactical
choice.
now,
for
the
past
few
minutes
we
have
obviously
heard
complaints
about
the
arguments,
and
we
have
heard
the
requests
that
because
of
the
arguments
alone
the
conviction
should
be
reversed.
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
that
has
been
consistent
throughout.
the
magistrate
through
the
eleventh
circuit
en
banc
every
time.
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
if
viewed
by
themselves
under
different
circumstances
and
perhaps
in
a
different
case,
yes,
sir.
i
agree
that
they
have
no
business
in
a
courtroom
in
our
land.
but
i
have
to
temper
that
answer--
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
--that
is
true.
and
obviously
mr.
darden
wants
this
to
be
the
first
one.
but
in
answer
to
justice
rehnquist's
question
about
that,
i
think
the
standard
has
been
developed,
at
least
in
the
federal
context,
in
united
states
versus
young.
now,
there
the
remarks
weren't
hardly
as
bad,
but
the
concept
and
the
standard
that
was
applied
was
whether
viewing
the
remarks
alone
could
a
determination
be
made
that
the
jury
was
unable
to
properly
weigh
the
evidence.
now,
for
a
moment
we
brush
aside
the
fact
that
there
was
no
objection,
and
that
there
was
no
objection
for
a
deliberate
reason.
even
without
that
consideration
momentarily
the
remarks
were
really
more
the
product
of
somebody
who
perhaps
got
carried
away
to
the
point
of
forgetting
his
professional
responsibility.
as
i
point
out
in
my
brief,
the
defense
counsel
made
a
very
skilful
closing
argument
in
which
he
pointed
out
the
fact
of
mr.
mcdaniels
parading
around
the
courtroom
and
slapping
paper
on
the
table,
and
apparently
he
was
doing
something
else
that
wasn't
demonstrated,
at
least
not
in
the
record.
he
mentioned
to
the
jury
that
mr.
mcdaniel
never
argues
the
evidence
or
talks
about
the
case.
he
wants
to
embarrass
you
into
a
verdict.
he
wants
you
to
be
harangued
into
a
verdict,
to
use
his
words.
if
i
may
quote,
"my
god,
i
get
the
impression
he
wants
to
be
there
to
pull
the
switch.
"
the
jury
heard
this,
and
they
saw
what
the
prosecutor
did,
and
only
they
did.
we
never
did.
if
you
will
remember,
the
record
reflects
that
those
44
pages
of
closing
argument
were
followed
by
an
equal,
if
not
greater,
number
of
closing
argument
pages
by
the
defense,
during
which
still
maintain
a
very
skillful
usage
of
the
prosecutor's
transgressions
was
had.
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
yes,
sir,
and
only
the
issue.
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
just
a
line,
sir.
the
claim
today
is
different
in
that
we
now
have
the
caldwell
eighth
amendment
ramification
introduced.
although
it
hasn't
been
stated,
i
guess
what
the
position
is
that
this
argument
carried
over
to
the
sentencing
phase
of
trial
such
that
the
recommendation
and
thus
the
ultimate
sentence
was
not
reliable
in
terms
of
the
eighth
amendment.
now,
i
will
just
mention
that
the
defense
counsel
followed
that
argument
with
a
lengthy
closing
argument,
as
long
or
longer.
at
the
close
of
that
argument,
the
judge
instructed
the
jury
in
a
capital
case
in
a
first
degree
murder,
the
instructions
of
which
are
very
long
and
involved.
at
that
point
in
time,
the
jury
retired
for,
as
the
record
reflects,
two
hours
and
ten
minutes.
after
they
returned
with
their
verdicts,
they
were
polled
individually
three
times,
once
for
each
count.
at
that
time,
brief
closing
remarks
were
made
by
defense
and
prosecution
during
the
penalty
phase
of
the
trial.
nothing
has
ever
been
claimed
here
or
before
that
the
remarks
of
the
prosecutor
during
penalty
phase
were
improper
in
any
way.
in
fact,
they
are
very
brief,
and
if
i
may
sum
up,
the
prosecutor
asked
the
jury
to
listen
and
remember
the
evidence
that
was
presented
at
trial,
and
i
am
sure
you
will
find
after
listening
to
the
judge's
instructions
that
mr.
darden
falls
into
the
aggravating
circumstances
and
doesn't
fall
into
any
of
the
mitigating
circumstances.
at
that
point,
the
record
shows
that
the
jury
deliberated
for
an
additional
40
minutes
and
returned
a
recommendation
of
death.
if
we
add
all
that
up,
we
are
looking
at
approximately
four-and-a-half
to
five
hours
when
the
recommendation
of
death
came
after
the
argument
which
the
defense
maintains
necessarily
infected.
i
think
that
is
a
factor
to
be
considered.
no
court
has
ever
held
that
the
arguments
alone
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
have
infected
the
determination
of
guilt.
now,
i
submit
that
if
that
is
true,
then
i
don't
see
how
the
carryover
effect
could
be
had
to
the
recommendation,
which
was
only
a
recommendation,
mind
you.
if
i
could
get
back
to
the
fact
of
the
lack
of
objection,
i
think
that
is
really
the
issue
in
this
case.
was
that
choice
permissible
in
a
capital
case?
as
i
have
stated
in
my
brief,
i
think
that
decisions
of
counsel
obviously
can
bind
any
defendant.
decisions
of
counsel
can
obviously
define...
i
am
sorry...
bind
a
capital
defendant.
but
will
those
decisions,
even
though
deliberate,
will
they
allow
a
capital
defendant
to
be...
to
suffer
any
adverse
or
prejudicial
effect.
and
that
is
what
i
think
the
crux
of
this
case
is
on
this
issue.
and
i
have
offered
the
standard
of
reasonableness,
borrowing
from
strickland
versus
washington.
did
mr.
goodwill's
decision
not
to
object,
did
it
represent
a
reasonable
decision
under
the
circumstances
and
facts
of
that
case?
now,
i
would
like
to
remind
the
court
again
that
this
case
was
indeed
the
first
case
in
polk
county,
florida,
in
1973.
everyone
involved
was
relatively,
if
not
totally,
new
at
proceeding
under
our
capital
statute
at
that
time.
if
you
accept
the
premise
that
goodwill
offered
under
oath
that
the
prosecutor
would
go
indeed
to
the
point
of
reversible
error,
you
have
got
to
examine
what
possible
effect
he
expected
or
hoped
for.
he
didn't
get
a
verdict
of
acquittal.
that
is
obvious.
so
he
wasn't
successful.
but
nevertheless
was
he
reasonable
in
anticipating
at
that
time
the
proposition
that
if
he
allowed
the
prosecutor
to
go
on,
could
he
possibly
embarrass
the
jury
out
of
a
verdict?
he
turned
everything
the
prosecutor
said
skillfully
around,
i
submit.
i
think
at
that
point
in
time,
not
using
the
benefit
of
hindsight
and
result-oriented
thinking,
i
think
it
was
reasonable.
he
had
made
other
tactical
choices
during
the
proceedings.
one,
which
i
mentioned
in
the
brief,
regarded
alibi.
mr.
darden
at
all
times
wanted
to
present
a
defensive
alibi,
and
based
on
their
investigation,
the
lawyers
assigned
to
the
case
could
not
account
for
his
whereabouts
between
approximately
5:30
and
6:30...
6:00
o'clock,
i
am
sorry.
that
period
of
time
was
a
gap.
the
decision
was
made
not
to
go
with
a
strong
alibi
defense
in
terms
of
a
formal
defense.
the
decision
as
revealed
in
the
federal
hearing
was
to
let
mr.
darden
take
the
stand,
provide
evidence
of
his
alibi
up
to
a
point,
and
let
the
state
provide
evidence
from
that
point
after,
in
other
words,
before
the
gap
and
after
the
gap.
that
turned
out,
we
learned
again
in
the
federal
hearing,
to
be
a
proper
choice,
because
the
prosecutor
told
the
defense
lawyer
later,
after
the
trial,
that
he
was
just
hoping
an
alibi
defense
would
have
been
presented
because
he
was
fully
prepared
in
rebuttal
to
come
in
and
show
that
from
where
mr.
darden
said
he
was
at
a
given
point,
there
was
ample
time
driving
the
routes
necessary
to
have
gotten
to
the
furniture
store,
committed
the
crime,
headed
out
of
town
on
state
road...
or
us
92,
and
had
the
accident,
which
was
never
disputed.
that
was
a
good
choice.
again,
the
choice
about
failing
to
object,
while
not
good,
was
still
reasonable,
and
i
think
even
though
this
is
a
capital
case,
and
i
am
not
standing
here
saying
that
we
can
always
provide
procedural
bars
in
capital
cases.
this
is
a
serious
business.
i
think,
to
borrow
language
from
the
court
in
other
decisions,
perhaps
capital
defendants
are
entitled
to
as
much
protection
as
possible,
but
i
nevertheless
think
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
it
was
reasonable.
the
evidence
that
was
presented
was
strong.
i
think
the
jury
was
intelligent
enough
to
know
that
the
prosecutor
was
simply
being
outrageous.
there
is
no
showing
that
they
were
infected
or
affected
by
what
he
said.
the
evidence
was
ample.
they
could
have
and
obviously
did
return
their
verdict
based
only
on
that
evidence,
and
i
think
the
petitioner
here,
the
defendant
has
failed
to
show
other
than
the
claim
how
or
why
there
is
even
the
possibility
that
they
were
affected
by
the
closing
argument.
i
think
he
needs
to
do
this.
i
posited
that
position
in
my
brief,
and
i
think
if
anything
is
written
in
that
regard
it
should
be
that
if
you
are
going
to
make
that
claim
under
facts
and
circumstances
like
this
case,
there
should
be
some
burden
shown.
i
think
there
has
been
none
offered
and
obviously
none
shown.
regarding
the
witherspoon
issue,
i
cheerfully
admit
that
the
question
of
caldwell
was
raised
in
the
third
petition
for
rehearing
seeking
the
fourth
en
banc
hearing
of
the
eleventh
circuit.
i
also
note
that
two
of
the
dissenters
mentioned
that
the
issue,
the
eighth
amendment
issue
of
closing
argument
ought
to
be
considered
in
light
of
caldwell
versus
mississippi
as
well
as
the
series
of
cases
that
the
court
had
come
out
with
about
the
same
time.
i
don't
believe,
however,
that
the
views
of
the
dissenters
are
equivalent
to
a
holding
on
the
issue.
i
don't
really
think
the
eleventh
circuit
has
ever
addressed
this.
but
as
against
the
possibility
that
some
could
consider
they
had,
i
would
like
to
say
that
this
is
not
caldwell.
i
don't
need
to
remind
the
court
what
was
involved
there,
but
i
will
briefly
emphasize
that
in
caldwell
that
which
lessened
the
reliability
of
the
sentence
were
remarks
made
by
the
prosecutor
to
the
jury
who
was
the
sentencer,
unlike
florida.
this
jury
in
mississippi
did
the
actual
sentencing.
the
remarks
were
of
the
tenor
that,
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
you
don't
really
need
to
worry
about
what
you
are
going
to
do,
because
this
case
is
going
to
be
reviewed
by
higher
authority.
an
objection
was
made,
unlike
here,
and
the
trial
judge
reinforced
that
statement
when
he
repeated
to
the
effect,
ladies
and
gentlemen,
that
is
true,
there
will
be
further
review
of
this
case.
now,
for
the
very,
i
think,
compelling
and
adequate
reasons
expressed
in
the
decision,
that
could
have
left
the
jury
with
the
possibility
that
they
could
have
shirked
their
responsibility
with
the
idea
that
someone
after
them
would
take
care
of
sentencing
this
individual.
thus
the
reliability
was
lessened.
we
don't
have
that
here.
we
have
got
improper
remarks,
but
we
don't
have
misstatements
of
law.
we
have
nothing
going
to
the
jury
which
indicated
they
could
do
anything
but
what
they
had
to
do.
at
that
point
it
was
guilt
or
innocence.
we
don't
have
the
trial
judge
reinforcing
what
the
prosecutor
said.
i
realize
that
the
rather
loose
claim
has
been
made
that
the
trial
judge
told
the
jury
to
listen
carefully
to
the
closing
arguments,
that
these
lawyers
were
trained,
and
that
they
should
pay
close
attention.
but
i
don't
think
that
hardly
rises
to
the
same
level
as
the
statements
of
the
trial
judge
in
the
mississippi
case.
the
last
issue
which
has
not
been
argued
by
mr.
harper
yet,
if
at
all,
regards
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
yes,
sir.
thank
you
for
reminding
me.
i
completely
forgot.
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
of
mr.
murphy?
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
his
principles.
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
yes,
i
do.
i
think
it
is
a
semantic
exercise
to
say
that
using
the
witt
standard
of
substantially
impairing
or
prevent,
i
think
when
the
man
who
sat
throughout
the
entire
examination,
and
i
would
like
to
step
aside
for
one
moment,
there
is
record
support.
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
perhaps--
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
--perhaps
relating
to
the
statute,
but
the
question
asked
in
witherspoon
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
statute
in
terms
of
the
language.
my
reading
of
witherspoon
was
that
the
47
venirmen
who
were
excused
were
done
on
the
basis
of
one
or
two
perfunctory
questions
to
the
effect,
do
you
have
any
views
against
capital
punishment.
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
and
i--
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
--no,
i
don't
think
it
would.
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
because
mr.
murphy
was
asked,
do
you
have
any
principles
in
opposition
such
that
you
could
not
participate
in
a
recommendation
of
the
sentence
of
death.
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
without
violating
those
principles.
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
is
it
possible
to
violate?
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
yes,
i
think
it
is
possible.
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
well,
it
would
be
my
position
that
the
violating
of
his
principles
would
represent
an
impairment
of
his
ability
to
follow
the
law.
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
that
is
my
position
on
that.
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
i
don't
know
i
would
go
that
far.
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
if
i
could
explain
my
answer,
i
don't
think
the
statute
was
as
much
in
issue
in
witherspoon
as
it
was
the
lack
of
questioning
which
trapped
the
statute.
had
the
illinois
judge
elucidated
on
the
statute
and
established
not
only
the
opposition
to
capital
punishment,
but
also
that
the
individual
jurors
involved
were
opposed
such
that
they
couldn't
follow
the
law,
i
don't
think
witherspoon
would
have
been
decided
the
way
it
was.
if
i
recall
justice
stewart
setting
the
tone
of
that
trial--
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
--no,
no,
they
didn't
ask
additional
questions,
but
previous
questions
were
asked
at
least
14
times.
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
no,
sir.
to
the
pool,
the
entire
pool,
and
two
things
i
would
like
to
point
out.
in
the
beginning,
the
trial
judge
explained
to
the
entire
people
before
12
were
selected
to
go
into
the
box
for
individual
examination,
he
specifically
told
them
in
language
which
even
the
defense
doesn't
complain
about
that
they
were
all
going
to
be
asked
questions
regarding
capital
punishment,
so
they
at
least
knew
that
something
was
coming
in
that
regard.
now,
mr.
harper
faults
the
eleventh
circuit
as
well
as
the
district
court,
the
conclusion
of
both
courts
that
presumably
or
obviously
mr.
murphy
heard
all
questions
going
before
the
one
asked
of
him.
now,
there
is
record
support,
a
gentleman
by
the
name
of
mulroy...
i
believe
it
is
on
page
89
of
the
trial
transcript...
was
called
in
after
peremptory
excusal,
and
the
first
thing
asked
of
him
was,
could
you
hear
the
questions
we
have
been
asking
all
the
jurors?
and
he
says,
yes,
i
could.
now,
it
would
be
obviously
better
if
the
same
question
was
asked
of
murphy,
but
it
wasn't.
but
i
think
the
presumption
or
the
logical
inference
can
be
that
the
circumstances
of
the
questioning
of
the
jurors
was
such
that
all
prospective
jurors,
and
i
am
talking
about
those
before
they
were
called
into
the
box
for
individual
examination
not
only
heard
the
questions
asked
of
those,
they
observed
the
people
who
answered
in
the
specific
way
those
five
who
were
excused.
they
saw
them
step
down.
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
that
is
quite
all
right,
sir.
but,
wherever
i
was,
i
think
i
was
about
to--
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
--i
am
relying
on
it,
your
honor,
but
i
still
don't
abandon
the
position
that
the
question
is
sufficient
under
witt
to
demonstrate
that
mr.
murphy
could
not
follow
the
law.
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
to
a
certain
degree,
but
no,
i
believe
it
would
have
been
sufficient
under
witherspoon
simply
because
we
don't
know
the
exact
questions
asked
in
witherspoon.
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
that
is
true.
no
experience.
but
all
courts
below
have
consistently
held
that
he
understood
the
concept
of
witherspoon
perfectly.
i
might
note
that
the
question
that
he
asked
goes
only
to
the
first
part
of
footnote
21
in
witherspoon.
he
never
got
to
the
guilt
or
innocence.
he
went
right
to
sentence,
those
two
concepts
which
were
merged
in
witt
and,
according
to
the
opinion
simplified.
now,
if
i
may
borrow
somewhat
from
the
preceding
argument,
i
think
that
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
objection
raised
here,
and
i
think
rather
prophetic
in
light
of
the
argument
before
us,
the
defense
filed
a
pretrial
motion
contending
that
the
state
not
be
allowed
to
ask
witherspoon
type
questions,
contending
that
such
questions
were
irrelevant
to
a
determination
of
guilt
or
innocence,
but
that
if
the
court
would
allow
those
questions
and
if
a
positive
response
were
asked,
that
challenges
for
cause
not
be
allowed,
without
articulating
it
any
more
than
that,
and
i
practically
stated
it
verbatim.
the
position
of
the
defense
in
'73
in
light
of
our
new
statute
was
that
now
that
we
have
a
bifurcated
trial,
anything
that
the
state
might
want
to
know
regarding
predisposition
to
witherspoon
has
nothing
to
do
with
guilt
or
innocence.
that
was
the
motion.
it
was
denied,
and
a
continuing
objection
was
lodged
throughout
the
entire
examination,
but
nothing
was
renewed.
and
i
think
that
is
critical.
no
juror
excused
was
made
the
object
of
a
statement,
motion,
or
objection
that
the
individual
was
impartial,
there
was
no
objection,
or
request,
perhaps
more
importantly,
there
was
no
request
that
the
trial
court
continue
questioning
and
see
if
the
juror,
whichever
juror
had
given
a
response
regarding
opposition
to
capital
punishment,
to
see
if
additional
questioning
could
be
had
to
determine
rehabilitation
on
guilt
or
innocence.
in
that
regard,
i
think
that
the
precise
issue
is
not
really
raised
in
terms
of
the
grigsby
concept.
the
excusal,
i
think,
was
proper
standing
by
itself.
the
right
question
was
asked.
i
don't
know
what
the
wrong
standard
is
that
they
are
continually
harping
on.
but
i
submit
that
it
was
proper.
now,
if
i
could
return
to
the
last
phase,
i
only
want
to
say
since
my
time
is
running
out
that...
and
if
i
may,
it
will
be
by
way
of
conclusion,
this
case
in
addition
to
being
as
old
as
it
is
is
rather
eerie.
we
have
a
murder
occurring
in
september
of
1973.
mr.
darden
was
arrested
that
evening
and
was
immediately
appointed
counsel.
the
record
indicates
both
directly
and
i
think
you
can
draw
logical
inferences
therefrom
that
the
entire
staff
of
a
public
defender's
office
in
polk
county,
florida
was
devoted
to
this
first
capital
case.
if
anyone
suffered,
i
think,
in
that
four-month
period
i
think
it
was
the
other
criminal
defendants
in
that
county
who
for
all
the
record
suggests
were
getting
no
attention
to
their
particular
cases
whatsoever.
the
case
is
prophetic
in
that
the
lawyers
13
years
ago
decided
that
witherspoon
did
not
apply
to
a
bifurcated
trial
by
filing
their
motion.
i
think
that
was
innovative
and
brilliant.
we
have
a
situation
where
a
trial
judge
in
what
can
only
be
considered
a
prophetic
vein
told
the
jury
that
at
the
second
phase
of
the
proceedings
they
were
only
going
to
recommend
sentence,
and
that
he
was
going
to
give
that
recommendation,
however,
great
weight.
the
great
weight
concept
to
our
recommendation
in
florida
was
embraced
in
tedder
versus
state,
and
that
wasn't
decided
until
two
or
three
years
after
this
trial.
the
trial
judge
told
the
defendant,
told
the
jury,
and
told
the
defendant's
lawyers
after
reading
the
statutory
mitigating
items
in
our
statute,
said
that
no
one
was
limited
to
these
things.
anything
in
mitigation,
anything
relevant
was
coming
in.
the
parameters
of
lockett
were
character
and
record
of
the
accused.
here
he
asked
for
history,
family
causes,
reputation,
anything
pertinent
to
the
proper
sentence.
the
lawyers
again
perhaps
being
able
to
see
in
the
future
asked
questions
of
the
individual
jurors
relating
to
race,
what
they
felt
about
statistics
showing
the
number
of
convictions
and
arrests
for
blacks
versus
whites,
something
which
i
believe
was
argued
last
month.
it
is
surprising,
i
think,
that
the
amount
of
due
process
afforded
to
this
individual
has
nevertheless
resulted
in
this
delay.
i
am
not
here
to
ask
for
speed.
i
am
here
only
to
ask
for
looking
at
this
case
in
the
context
of
what
it
was
as
it
was
tried
13
years
ago.
we
can't
judge
either
the
performance
of
counsel
or
the
performance
of
the
judge
by
standards
which
have
evolved
at
this
point
in
time,
even
though
i
might
add
i
don't
think
the
judge
could
have
improved
one
bit
between
now
and
then.
therefore
i
would
ask
that
the
eleventh
circuit's
decision
in
this
case
be
affirmed
in
all
respects.
thank
you.
