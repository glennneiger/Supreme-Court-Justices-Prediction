justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
because
it
was
argued,
are
you
going
to
comment
on
the
witherspoon
problem
in
your
presentation?
that
was
argued
both
orally
and
in
you
brief.
justice
stevens
and
in
your
brief,
i
notice
you
state
that
the
venirman
murphy
told
the
trial
judge
his
principles
were
such
that
he
could
not
vote
to
recommend
a
penalty
regardless
of
the
facts,
but
that
is
not
what
he
told
the
jury,
is
it?
that
was
not
the
question
that
was
asked,
was
it?
justice
stevens
he
was
asked
whether
he
could
do
that
without
violating
his
own
scruples.
justice
stevens
yes.
do
you
think
that
is
an
adequate
question?
justice
stevens
i
wanted
to
break
my
question
in
two
parts.
first,
if
you
just
had
that
question
by
itself,
would
you
not
agree
that
that
is
just
almost
verbatim
the
illinois
statute
that
was
held
insufficient
in
witherspoon?
justice
stevens
they
were
asked
there
whether
they
had
scruples
against
the
death
penalty.
justice
stevens
well,
the
statute
provided
if
you
have
conscientious
scruples
against
capital
punishment,
you
can
be
excused
for
cause.
justice
stevens
do
you
think
today
if
a
venirman
is
asked
if
he
has
conscientious
scruples
against
capital
punishment,
and
he
says
yes,
would
that
be
sufficient
to
justify
his
using
it
for
cause?
justice
stevens
well,
why
isn't
that
precisely
the
question
that
was
asked
here?
justice
stevens
without
violating
those
principles.
justice
stevens
do
you
think
it
is
impossible
that
a
person
could
violate
his
own
principles
if
the
law
required
him
to
do
so?
justice
stevens
yes,
that
is
exactly
what--
justice
stevens
--then
he
hasn't
said
you
couldn't
vote
against
the
death
penalty.
he
has
only
said
he
can't
do
it
without
violating
his
principles.
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
then
i
suppose
you
would
say
that
the
statute
held
invalid...
the
illinois
statute
held
invalid
in
witherspoon
is
now
valid
under
the
later
case?
justice
stevens
witherspoon
has
been
overruled,
is
your
position.
that
is
what
it
comes
down
to,
i
think.
justice
stevens
you
just
did.
justice
stevens
in
other
words,
you
are
saying
if
they
had
asked
that
additional
question,
which
of
course
they
didn't
ask
here,
either,
as
to
whether
they
could--
justice
stevens
--of
this
juror?
justice
stevens
well,
may
i
ask,
do
you
think
that
the
record
before
the
particular
question
was
asked
of
murphy
is
clear
enough
so
that
if
the
judge
had
just
said
to
mr.
murphy,
is
there
any
reason
why
you
can't
sit
in
this
case,
and
he
had
said
no,
that
he
could
then
have
been...
i
am
sorry.
i
have
it
backwards.
he
did
at
least
have
to
ask
this
question
to...
i
am
sorry.
no,
i
have
it
backwards.
i'm
sorry.
i
shouldn't
have
interrupted
you.
justice
stevens
you
are
relying
heavily
on
what
was
said
in
the
general
discussion
rather
than
on
this
particular
question,
is
really
what
i
am
trying
to--
justice
stevens
--if
it
weren't
for
witt,
would
you
agree
it
was
plainly
insufficient
under
witherspoon.
would
you
not
agree
with
that?
you
have
to
rely
on
witt
as
in
effect
having
overruled
witherspoon,
i
believe.
justice
stevens
but
we
do
know
from
the
first
paragraph
of
the
witherspoon
opinion
that
questions
complying
with
the
illinois
statute
were
not
sufficient,
and
the
questions
complying
with
the
illinois
statute
are
substantially
in
the
language
that
this
trial
judge,
who
had
had
no
experience
in
death
cases,
as
i
understand
it,
asked
in
this
case.
