justice
marshall
has
there
ever
been
a
finding
about
effective
assistance
of
counsel
in
this
case?
justice
marshall
there
has
been?
i
thought
so.
justice
marshall
well,
while
i
have
you
interrupted,
do
you
agree
that
there
are
some
arguments
that
get
to
the
point
where
they
are
constitutionally
impermissible?
justice
marshall
i
keep
hearing
that,
but
i
have
difficulty
finding
a
case
that
after
saying
that
they
reversed.
