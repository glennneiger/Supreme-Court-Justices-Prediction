mr.
paul
john
cambria,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
believe
that
the
decision
below
is
simply
a
reflection,
first
of
all,
of
the
court's
interpretation
of
its
own
rules.
as
you'll
notice
when
you
read
their
decision,
they
rely
substantially
upon
decisions
of
the
new
york
state
court
of
appeals,
and
they
discuss,
and
i
think
in
line
with
maryland
v.
macon,
they
discuss
the
federal
cases
as
guidance
and
they
take
the
federal
law
of
roaden
and
lee
and
so
on
from
the
standpoint
of
saying
that
there
has
to
be
a
presumption
of
protection
under
the
first
amendment,
that
there
is
a
higher
hurdle
that
must
be
achieved
when
we're
analyzing
this
kind
of
material,
but
basically
th
bedrock
of
this
decision
is
state
law.
and
in
answering
mr.
defranks,
he
says
that
they
do
not,
the
majority,
answer
the
dissent,
and
the
dissent
cites
no
authority,
they
cite
no
state
authority.
they
rely
from
time
to
time
upon
federal
cases
which
i
think,
when
you
analyze
them,
we
determine
just
how
low
and
how
easy
it
has
become
throughout
all
these
federal
jurisdictions
to
obtain
a
warrant,
to
stop
a
publication
which
happens
naturally
in
every
case
where
a
search
warrant
is
issued.
there
is
a
chill
that
occurs.
i
think
that
the
language
of
the
chief
justice
in
the
roaden
case,
and
speaking
on
behalf
of
the
court
indicating
that
when
you
take
a
film
it's
the
equivalent
of
taking
a
number
of
books
and
magazines,
and
that
holds
true
here,
and
that's
what's
happened.
mr.
paul
john
cambria,
jr.
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
to
my
recollection,
did
not
specifically
address
how
many
numbers
of
copies
were
taken.
mr.
paul
john
cambria,
jr.
pardon
me?
mr.
paul
john
cambria,
jr.
only
in
reciting
what
had
happened
and
what
was
taken.
mr.
paul
john
cambria,
jr.
we
did
not
make
an
argument,
a
prior
adversary
hearing
argument,
because
we
don't
believe
that
prior
adversary
hearing
is...
this
isn't
the
heller
case,
i
submit,
because
in
heller
this
court
didn't
do
away
with
the
necessity
of
the
scrupulous
exactitude.
it
just
said
that
once
the
magistrate
has
been
satisfied
and
once
the
higher
hurdle
has
been
achieved,
if
you
accomplish
a
mass
seizure
then
you
must
give
a
post-seizure
hearing.
but,
it
doesn't
do
away
with
the
initial
step
which
requires
the
scrutiny,
and
what
this
court
said
below
is
that,
we
think
there
are
three
parts
to
the
test.
there
isn't
just
one
part.
and
this
particular
police
officer
concerned
himself...
and
frankly
he
wasn't
a
police
officer,
he
was
someone
from
the
district
attorney's
office,
he
concerned
himself
only
with
attempting
to
describe
the
sexual
conduct
part,
the
second
part
of
the
miller
test.
he
did
nothing
to
address
the
other
two
parts
of
the
test,
and
i
think
that
this
court--
mr.
paul
john
cambria,
jr.
--i
think
the
two
things,
yes,
i
think
that
under
illinois
versus
gates
that
is
a
fair
reading
of
the
opinion
there.
secondly,
that
has
not
yet
been
applied
in
the
state
of
new
york
and
i
reaffirm
the
fact
that
we
have--
mr.
paul
john
cambria,
jr.
--yes,
and
particularly
in
this
first
amendment
area.
if
these
cases
mean
anything,
that
were
decided
by
this
court
over
a
long
stretch
of
our
history,
saying,
"scrupulous
exactitude",
and
"higher
hurdle"
and
"focus
searchingly
on
the
question"
and
so
on,
all
of
those
words,
if
they
mean
anything
then
it
seems
to
me
that
what
we
don't
do
is,
we
don't
fill
in
the
blanks
and
assume
that
the
other
two
prongs
exist,
as
this
court
last
term
was
not
willing
to
fill
in
the
blanks
in
the
spokane
arcade
case.
there
the
argument
was
made
on
behalf
of
the
government
that
prongs
b
and
c
supply...
or
the
test
that
was
given
there
in
washington...
supply
prong
a,
and
that
fills
the
bill,
and
this
court
took
the
position
that...
i
think
i'm
accurately
reflecting
it...
that
they're
separate,
that
they're
independent,
that
you
can't
have
one
slosh
over,
if
you
will,
onto
the
other.
and
what
the
court
below
said
was,
and
i
submit
this
is
the
most
important
part
of
it,
you
must
pay
attention
and
deference
to
all
three
parts
of
the
test.
now,
when
we
look
at
this
affidavit,
this
particular
investigator
from
the
district
attorney's
office
never
even
claims
that
he
read
the
obscenity
statute,
that
he
even
knew
that
there
were
three
parts
to
it,
that
he
even
appreciated
that
there
was
more
than
one--
mr.
paul
john
cambria,
jr.
--i
think
that
when
we
make
a
decision
about
probable
cause,
and
i
hope
the
history
of
the
court
bears
me
out...
i
know
it
does
with
regard
to
the
state
court
decisions...
that
all
of
the
elements
must
be
satisfied
in
some
preliminary
fashion.
mr.
paul
john
cambria,
jr.
well,
yes,
it
does,
and
i'll
say
how
it
does.
mr.
paul
john
cambria,
jr.
under
690.40
of
our
new
york
procedures,
any
communication
whatsoever,
beyond
the
papers
is
and
must
be
recorded.
there
was
no
such
communication
on
this
case.
mr.
paul
john
cambria,
jr.
but
the
magistrate
never
reviewed
any
of
the
materials,
your
honor.
that's
the
problem.
the
magistrate,
i
think--
mr.
paul
john
cambria,
jr.
--i
think
that
that's
precisely
what--
mr.
paul
john
cambria,
jr.
--i
think,
as
it
comes
up
here,
that
assumption
comes
with
it.
as
we
see
the
court
of
appeals'
analysis
of
it,
the
court
of
appeals
said,
there
is
no
basis
for
you
to
do
that,
interpreting
our
cases
which
require
a
full
and
searching
inquiry,
using
the
words
of
the
court
of
appeals,
and
are
measured
in
comprehensive
exam,
we
say
that
there
was
something
more
that
had
to
be
done,
that
at
best,
at
best
these
affidavits
could
be
described
as
ambiguous,
and
the
court
said,
the
magistrate
should
have
taken
that
extra
step.
and
what
i'm
suggesting
to
this
court
is,
this
case
is
not--
mr.
paul
john
cambria,
jr.
--pardon
me?
mr.
paul
john
cambria,
jr.
i
don't
believe
that
that's
so,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
when
you
analyze
this
decision,
that
this
case
is
one
state
court
decision
after
another
that
does
not
have
to
rely
upon,
an
does
not
rely
upon
federal
precedent
in
order
to
be
self-standing.
mr.
paul
john
cambria,
jr.
i
agree,
and
i
said
that
in
my
petition,
in
my
opposition
to
the
petition,
because
when
you
look
at
this
case
and
you
look
at
the
main
cases,
the
podbora
case,
it
relies
on
another
new
york
state
case
and
that
new
york
state
case
chronicles
all
the
state
decisions.
and
when
you
look
at
the
opening
salvos,
the
state
constitution
is
involved,
all
the
state
cases
are
discussed,
and
those
are
the
things
that
the
court
dwells
on,
the
court
of
appeals.
they
don't
dwell
on
the
federal
cases
and
say
that
it's
a
federal
standard.
they
use
the
language
of
their
own
cases
and
they
say
it's
a
state
standard.
and,
i
think
what
the
problem
is,
is
when
the
court
found
there
was
an
ambiguity
here,
and
the
ambiguity
was
because
there
was
no
addressing
of
the
other
two
prongs
of
the
test,
and
they
said
that
in
this
particular
very
important
area
where
we've
used
all
these
words,
that
they
don't
consider
platitudes
like
"scrupulous
exactitude"
and
so
on,
that
in
this
area
we
can
assume
and
conjecture
the
various
elements,
that...
i
am
sorry.
mr.
paul
john
cambria,
jr.
i
think
that
when
we
analyze
the
decision
at
a-4
of
the
record,
they
start
off
by
talking
about
it
in
parallel
terms.
they
say,
new
york
constitution,
article
1,
section
12,
they
cite
that
first.
they
then
go
on
to
the
fourth
amendment.
they
talk
about
reasonable
cause
under
article--
mr.
paul
john
cambria,
jr.
--well,
i
think
that
it
meets
it
in
this
sense.
i
think
that
michigan
versus
long
says,
and
later
on
decisions
of
this
court,
upton,
in
the
concurrence
in
upton,
indicated
that
it
would
be
better,
and
there
should
be
a
definitive
statement,
so
a
lot
of
time
is
not
wasted
by
reviews
back
and
forth.
but
i
don't
believe
that
this
court
said
that
if,
in
fact,
the
state
court
does
not
specifically
make
a
statement
but
makes
it
quite
clear
from
their
determination
that
the
federal
cases
are
guideposts
and
benchmarks
but
not
what
they're
relying
on
in
making
the
decision.
they
really
use
the
federal
cases
for
propositions
such
as,
items
are
presumptively
protected,
or
there's
a
higher
standard
for
books
than
there
are
for
weapons.
mr.
paul
john
cambria,
jr.
yes,
i
think
that
that's
true
in
connection
with
that
general
principle
which
no
one
disagrees
with,
i
hope,
that
there
must
be
scrupulous
exactitude.
but
in
fashioning
what
the
magistrate's
duty
is
down
below
they
rely
specifically
and
only
on
the
new
york
state
cases.
they
say
here,
and
the
nub
of
the
decision
is,
the
magistrate
below,
given
all
the
platitudes
of
scrupulous
exactitude
and
other
things,
the
magistrate
below
should
have
gotten
involved.
it
could
have
been
the
simplest
thing,
simply
ask
a
question.
would
it
be
too
much
to
ask
that
we
had
a
procedure
where
the
magistrate
simply
said
to
the
police
officer,
did
you
leave
anything
out?
was
there
dialogue?
was
there
a
story?
i
mean,
a
few
pointed
questions
like
that.
affidavits
would
be
sufficient.
there
wouldn't
be
an,
bogging
down
of
the
warrant
process.
it
would
just
be
true
to
the
new
york
state
precedent
by
saying,
you've
got
to
get
involved,
we
can't
just
assume
that
these
points
are
established.
we
can't
assume
that
these
other
facts
will
be
established.
because,
really,
when
you
look
at
the
three-part
test
of
miller,
the
most
important
and
the
most
difficult
parts,
r-a
and
r-c,
the
middle
part
is
the
easiest
part.
mr.
paul
john
cambria,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
we
have
to
define
what
it
is
and
what
happened
here
is...
forgetting
the
miller
case,
taking
the
statute
which
the
court
refers
to,
235,
it
incorporates
the
definition
of
miller.
mr.
paul
john
cambria,
jr.
if
we
look
at...
well,
i
think
that
interprets
that
statutes
and
you
have
to
have...
when
you're
finding
probable
cause
you
have
to
start
somewhere
and
i
submit,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
must
start
with
the
statute
and
say,
what
are
the
elements
that
i
as
a
judge
am
attempting
to
find
probable
cause
to
issue
a
warrant
for.
and
once
you
do
that,
you
say
there
are
three,
and
in
this
case
i'm
submitting
that
the
court
below
is
recognizing
the
two
most
important
elements
are
the
first
one
and
the
last
one.
everybody
can
describe
the
sexual
conduct.
that's
easy.
butwhere
the
judge
is
the
most
important
critical
factor
is
analyzing
the
pruriency
part
and
analyzing
the
value
part,
and
we
see
that
when
we
look
at
our
cases.
i
cited
for
the
court--
mr.
paul
john
cambria,
jr.
--i...
the
court
of
appeals,
of
course,
says
no.
the
court
of
appeals
says
they
can
go
on
affidavits
but
they
must
get
involved
affirmatively.
mr.
paul
john
cambria,
jr.
i
believe
that
in
exigent
circumstances
that
that
could
be
a
substitute
which
would
be
available
to
the
court,
meaning
in
the
sense
that--
mr.
paul
john
cambria,
jr.
--i
think
that
the
magistrate
should
review
the
film.
that's
the
way
that
the
citizenry
of
our
country--
mr.
paul
john
cambria,
jr.
--i
say
yes,
because
i
think
that's
the
best
way,
and
in
this
case
it
was
easy.
they
had--
mr.
paul
john
cambria,
jr.
--there's
no
case
which
says
that.
it
was
left
open
in
lee
art,
and
it's
been
talked
about
a
number
of
times
in
other
cases
but
there's
no
case
that
i
know
of
from
this
court
that
says
that
you
must
see
the
film.
as
far
as
i
can
determine
the
circuits
are
everywhere,
in
the
sense
that
if
we
look
at
a
catalogue
of
what
some
of
the
circuits
have
done
as
far
as
sufficiency
of
warrants...
i
mean,
we
can
find
the
fifth
circuit,
for
example,
saying...
and
the
second
circuit
saying
that
a
simple
picture
and
a
few
words
description
uttered
by
a
police
officer
in
an
affidavit
is
enough
to
issue
a
search
warrant.
now,
i
submit
that
absolutely
in
no
way
takes
into
account
the
first
and
the
third
prong
of
the
test,
and
i'm
not
saying
there
should
be
guilt
or
innocence,
it
shouldn't
be
a
screenplay
attached
to
the
warrant,
shouldn't
be
any
of
those
things.
but
we
must
in
some
way
discuss
these
prongs
because
they
are
part
of
the
offense
involved,
and
in
addition
to
that
if
we're
going
to
be
true
to
all
these
statements
we've
made
about
the
higher
hurdle
which
must
be
achieved,
or
the
scrupulous
exactitude,
then
what
does
it
mean
if
it
can
be
satisfied
by
simply
saying,
there
is
a
picture,
i
saw
it,
it
shows
this
sexual
conduct,
and
there
was
a
brief
description
on
the
box
and
therefore
the
warrant
should
be
issued.
i
submit
that
what
this
case
below
has
meant,
what
it
does
mean,
is
that
it's
the
procedure
which
is
important.
if
we
take
this
procedure
and
we
applied
it
to
tropic
of
cancer
or
capricorn,
and
i
made
reference
to
this
in
my
brief,
if
we
took
this
procedure
and
applied
it
to
that,
we
could
take
the
language
that
you
find
at
page
145
of
the
decision
written
by
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
capricorn
and
tropic
of
cancer,
and
in
that
case
the
words
of
the
judge
were
that,
"practically
everything
that
the
world
loosely
regards
as
sin
is
detailed
in
vivid,
lurid,
salacious
language
of
smut,
prostitution
and
dirt,
and
all
of
it
is
related
without
the
slightest
expression
of
an
idea
of
abandonment,
consistent
with
the
general
tenor
of
the
book
even
human
excrement
is
dwelt
upon
in
the
dirtiest
words.
"
"the
author
conduct
the
reader
through
sex
orgies
and
perversions
of
sex
organs
and
always
in
the
base
language
of
the
bawdy
house.
"
"nothing
has
the
grace
of
purity
or
goodness.
"
i
submit
that
this...
that
the
cases
that
we
cited
in
our
brief,
talking
about
the
low
threshold
that's
emanated
because
of
no
stringent
decision
that
there
ought
to
be
in
this
area,
would
take
that
language
which
was
written
by
a
federal
judge
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
would
say
that
that
was
enough
of
a
description
of
tropic
of
cancer
and
capricorn,
henry
miller
novels
which
are
all
accepted
now,
to
make
them
the
subject
of
a
search
warrant
for
purposes
of
scrutinizing
them
with
regard
to
obscenity.
it
would
be
the
same
way
if
we
paid
no
deference
to
the
first
and
third
prongs
of
the
test,
if
i
were
to
review
hair
or
one
of
the
other
accepted
broadway
plays
and
just
describe
the
sexual
conduct
that
i
saw
with
no
reference
to
the
music,
no
reference
to
the
story
line
or
the
political
satire,
we'd
be
in
the
exact
same
position
and
i
submit
that
a
judge,
following
this
laid-back
approach,
this
lax
approach,
could
simply
issue
a
warrant,
and
where
would
i
be
under
a
franks
versus
delaware
argument
to
say
that
the
person
who
reviewed
hair,
for
example,
didn't
read
the
obscenity
statute,
never
declared
that
they
did.
usually
officers
in
their
affidavits
may
say
they
have
a
background,
if
they're
in
drug
work
and
they're
asking
for
a
search
warrant
with
regard
to
drugs,
they
iterate
that
they
had
some
kind
of
experience
in
the
past
so
that
you'd
have
some
way
of
putting
what
they
say
into
context.
we
don't
have
that
here,
and
if
i
gave
you
an
affidavit
from
hair,
untaught
as--
mr.
paul
john
cambria,
jr.
--your
honor?
mr.
paul
john
cambria,
jr.
i
submit
that
would
be
enough
for
two
reasons.
mr.
paul
john
cambria,
jr.
right.
mr.
paul
john
cambria,
jr.
right,
and
that
would
be
enough
because,
number
one,
he
would
have
hit
all
the
elements
of
murder,
and
secondly--
mr.
paul
john
cambria,
jr.
--i
think
that
the
simple
taking
of
life
would
have
enough
to
show
a
violation
of
at
least
new
york
law.
mr.
paul
john
cambria,
jr.
because
the
difference
is,
there's
no
first
amendment
which
presumptively
protects
murder.
there
is
a
first
amendment
which...
and
in
article
1,
section
12,
which
presumptively
protects
these
publications
which
to,
use
the
words
of
roaden,
are
arguably--
mr.
paul
john
cambria,
jr.
--pardon
me?
mr.
paul
john
cambria,
jr.
i
think
i
have
all
of
these
decisions
that
indicate
that
there
must
be
the
determination
by
the
magistrate
and
that
the
magistrate
has
to
make
the
finding
and
the
determination
through
a
higher
hurdle,
through
a
scrupulous
exactitude,
through
a
searching,
focused
inquiry,
and
i
submit
that
that's
the
difference
here.
mr.
paul
john
cambria,
jr.
i
believe
that
that's
true,
and
i
believe
that
this
court
has
said
that
that's
true.
mr.
paul
john
cambria,
jr.
excuse
me.
mr.
paul
john
cambria,
jr.
i
suppose
that
if
you
were
a
district
attorney
and
you
murdered
an
author
because
you
were
trying
to
silence
what
he
was
writing
at
the
time,
that
that
could
be
a
first
amendment
matter
and
we
could
have
an
argument
with
regard
to
it.
if
i
might,
in
summing
this
up--
mr.
paul
john
cambria,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
paul
john
cambria,
jr.
i
think
that
the
question
here
is,
under
new
york
state,
as
they
perceive
their
laws,
their
statutes,
their
laws,
their
cases,
did
the
judge
here,
given
these
facts,
have
a
sufficient
basis
to
try
to
make
a
probable
cause
determination
and
only
a
probable
cause
determination.
the
court
says
on
page
a-5,
consistent
with
these
rules,
the
task
of
the
issuing
magistrate
in
this
case
was
not
to
decide
guilt
or
innocence
but
to
determine
in
a
preliminary
way
from
the
information
submitted
and
available
to
him,
whether
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
material
to
be
seized
was
obscene
within
the
tripartite
definition
of
the
statute.
mr.
paul
john
cambria,
jr.
i
think
what
that
means
is
this:
as
this
court
said
in
roaden
and
heller
and
lee
art
and
all
the
cases
we've
talked
about
today,
there's
a
higher
standard
in
a
sense
that
the
judge
must
focus
searchingly
on
the
question
of
obscenity,
and
even
this
court
used
the
word,
on
the
question
of
obscenity,
in
marcus,
as
opposed
to
probable
obscenity.
so,
what
we're
saying,
i
think
is
what
we've
said
in
all
these
first
amendment...
all
these
search
and
seizure
cases
that
the
court
has
decided.
there
is
a
higher
hurdle
in
the
sense
of
analyzing
probable
cause,
because
we
do
require
this
scrupulous
exactitude
and
we
do
require
it
at
the
seizure
stage.
that's
the
would
be
involved.
other
than
that,
only
time
the
judge
we'd
have
a
decision
on
the
merits.
so,
roaden
and
lee
and
all
these
cases
which
dealt
with
search
and
seizure
couldn't
have
meant
anything
else
except
that
in
restraining
the
material
ex
parte
which
is
what
happened
by
the
search
warrant,
there
must
be
a
higher
hurdle,
not
guilt
or
innocence
but
a
higher
hurdle
in
how
you
evaluate
probable
cause.
so
that
it
must--
mr.
paul
john
cambria,
jr.
--that's
true.
i
say
roaden--
mr.
paul
john
cambria,
jr.
--well,
i
take
this
position--
mr.
paul
john
cambria,
jr.
--roaden,
in
the
sense
that
roaden
seems
to
chronicle
all
the
cases
in
this
area,
because
roaden
takes
us
back
to
marcus
and
says
we
have
a
higher
hurdle.
it
then
talks
about
lee
art
theater
which
was
a
case
with
a
warrant
where
there
was
a
perfunctory
or
a
conclusory
showing,
and
so
it's
really
a
number
of
cases
all
together,
and
in
new
york
it's
a
whole
number
of
separate
cases
all
together.
roaden
didn't
have
a
warrant
but
lee
art
had
a
warrant.
marcus
had
a
warrant.
a
quantity
of
books
had
a
warrant.
heller
had
a
warrant.
and
in
all
of
those
cases
the
court
always
said
that
in
this
preliminary
warrant
procedure
we
must
have
this
higher
hurdle,
and
that's
all
the
court
was
saying
below,
was
that
we
must
have
this
higher
procedure
not
to
establish
guilt
or
innocence
but
have
the
magistrate
make
the
findings
and
have
an
adequate
basis
to
make
the
findings,
and
i
believe
that's
all
they're
saying.
they're
not
saying,
we've
got
to
try
the
case
before
we
ever
have
a
trial,
in
essence,
that
we
do
it.
and
the
procedure
that
they
suggest
here
is
not
elaborate.
it's
not
cumbersome.
it's
simply,
if
you're
going
to
rely
on
affidavits
as
an
issuing
magistrate,
get
involved.
ask
some
questions
when
there
are
ambiguities,
under
our
state
log
of
cases.
ask
some
questions.
it's
as
simple
as
that.
i
think
we're
entitled
to
that.
mr.
paul
john
cambria,
jr.
i...
when
we
made
that
argument
below,
the
response
was
that
there
would
be
some
evidentiary
objections.
i
don't
have
any
idea--
mr.
paul
john
cambria,
jr.
--well,
the
problem--
mr.
paul
john
cambria,
jr.
--what
we
gained
is
this:
the
minute
that
that
warrant
hits
that
store,
which
again
is
not
the
yellow
front
store,
that
sends
a
chill
up
the
spine
of
those
individuals
that's
heard
from
coast
to
coast,
and
i
mean
that
with
all
sincerity,
because
each
time
this
warrant
hits
a
store
and
some
presumptively
protected
material
is
taken
off
the
shelf
pursuant
to
the
warrant,
that
constitutes
a
chill
which
every
one
of
us--
mr.
paul
john
cambria,
jr.
--your
honor,
that
issue
was
brought
up
in
the
hair
case,
southeastern
promotions,
and
of
course
this
court
found
there
that
the
punishment
after
the
crime
such
as
in
penal
law
situations
is
one
thing,
but
punishment
pre-crime
which
is
the
restraint
situation
is
something
more
onerous,
and
i
take
the
position
that
it
is.
and
i
submit
what
happens,
is,
this
procedure
is
important
to
us,
and
it's
very
important
as
to
how
it
affects
not
just
these
books,
magazines,
films,
what
have
you,
but
all
the
others,
the
tropic
of
cancers
of
tomorrow,
the
hairs
and
other
cases
of
tomorrow.
how
low
can
the
threshold
be,
is
what
it
amounts
to.
in
new
york
this
court
has
said
that
the
magistrate
should
be
involved.
there
should
be
this
focused
inquiry
and
so
on.
i
submit
that's
fair,
it's
reasonable,
and
we're
all
entitled
to
it,
and
i
ask
you
to
affirm
the
decision
below
based
upon
the
fact
that
we
are
entitled
to
that
much
since
it
will
not
stifle
the
criminal
process--
it
will
not
in
any
way
hamper
prosecutions.
it
will
simply
protect
us
from
overzealous
individuals
who
come
forth
with
warrants
based
upon
applications
like
these
where
the
magistrate
clearly
was
not
involved
and
wasn't
true
to
the
new
york
state
decisions
that
he's
mandated
to
be
bound
by.
i
thank
you
very
much.
