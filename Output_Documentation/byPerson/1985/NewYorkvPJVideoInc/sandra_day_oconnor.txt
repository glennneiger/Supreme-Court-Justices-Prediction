o'connor
there's
some
suggestion
in
respondent's
brief,
that
could
have
been
the
case
here,
that
this
was
the
only
copy
or
something?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what...
the
circumstances
here,
it's
a
business
that
rents
out
videotapes?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
if
the
state
ware
to
seize
under
the
warrant,
in
fact
the
only
copy
of
the
videotape
in
such
a
business
for
a
particular
film,
is
there
an
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
state
to
provide
hearing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
does
the
state
have
to
offer
that
in
the
first
instance
and
find
out
whether
that's
the
case,
or
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
the
burden
is
on
the
business
owner
to
request
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
which
was
not
done?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
defranks,
you
think
that
in...
for
a
warrant
to
be
proper
that
there
has
to
be
established
probable
cause,
that
every
element
of
the
crime
has
been
committed,
or
something
less
than
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
just
answer
the
question,
please.
does
every
element
of
the
crime
have
to
be
supported
by
probable
cause?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
guess
the
argument
here
focuses
on
whether
in
fact
all
the
elements
of
this
offense
have
been
met?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
by
inference?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
defranks,
assume
for
a
moment
that
the
warrant
was
not
supported
by
probable
cause
here.
is
it
clear
from
the
record
that
the
officers
acted
in
good
faith
in
executing
the
warrant?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
then
that,
under
the
leon
case,
that
the
material
could
be
seized
in
any
event?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
as
a
matter
of
state
law?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
under
illinois
versus
gates,
doesn't
the
court
ordinarily
defer
to
reasonable
inferences
drawn
by
the
issuing
magistrate,
even
though
they
aren't
the
only
inferences
that
might
be
drawn?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
it's
your
position
that
we
just
shouldn't
apply
the
illinois
versus
gates
standards
of
reviewing
what
the
magistrate
did,
is
that
your
position?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
where
is
the
clearer
statement
in
the
case
which
we
require
to
go
off
on
the
adequate
and
independent
state
grounds,
in
light
of
the
court's
language
dealing
with
application
of
the
fourth
amendment
in
the
citation
of
roaden,
marcus
versus
the
search
warrant,
stanford
versus
texas,
maryland
versus
macon?
there
is
no
clear
and
plain
statement
that
the
court
was
relying
on
state
law.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
certainly
doesn't
meet
the
michigan
versus
long
standard
by
any
stretch.
