mr.
john
j.
defranks
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
present
case
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
involves
the
warrant
seizure
of
13
videocassette
recordings
including
eight
titles
alleged
to
be
obscene
under
new
york's
obscenity
law.
the
issue
as
we
see
it,
before
this
court,
is
twofold:
firstly,
whether
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
has
elevated
the
standard
of
proof
necessary
to
support
the
evidentiary
seizure
of
presumptively
protected
material,
and
secondly,
whether
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
requires
such
an
elevation
in
light
of
the
circumstances
of
the
present
case
and
the
available
first
amendment
safeguards.
now,
although
it
is
here
disputed,
i
think
the
record
provides
firm
support
for
our
contention
that
the
standard
has
in
fact
been
elevated.
in
the
words
of
the
majority,
there
must
be
enough
proof
before
the
magistrate
to
allow
him
to
judge
the
obscenity
of
the
films
and
to
determine
that
they
are
not
entitled
to
constitutional
protection.
mr.
john
j.
defranks
yes,
sir.
it
was
mere
than
imprecise
language
on
the
part
of
the
court
of
appeals,
and
this
is
clear
upon
reading
the
dissent.
in
the
third
paragraph
of
the
dissenting
opinions
he
points
out
to
the
majority
that
they
have
required
an
unambiguous
demonstration
of
obscenity
in
order
to
support
the
present
seizure.
he
advised
them
that
the
standard
has
been
universally
rejected
by
the
courts
of
the
united
states.
the
majority
responds
in
footnote
3,
not
to
deny
the
elevated
standard
but
in
essence
to
confirm
it,
chiding
the
dissent
for
not
having
provided
any
case
authority
for
his
claim
of
universal
rejection.
the
dissenter
took
four
more
opportunities
to
point
out
to
the
majority
that
they
have
elevated
the
standard
of
proof.
all
four
references
were
ignored.
they
certainly
were
not
denied.
mr.
john
j.
defranks
no,
i
don't
believe
you
have
to,
but
the
dissent
makes
it
very
clear.
the
majority
speaks
for
itself
on
the
unequivocal
standard
where
they
say,
we
look
at
this
information
and
we
can
see
it
being
inculpatory,
or
another
interpretation
where
it
may
be
less
inculpatory.
so,
the
majority
makes
clear
what
they
are
doing.
in
its
legal
analysis
the
court
of
appeals
committed
a
fatal
flaw
which
probably
resulted
in
the
elevated
standard.
they
relied
upon
the
scrupulous
exactitude
requirement
of
stanford
to
raise
the
standard
of
proof,
yet
in
this
case
the
magistrate
made
the
probable...
cause
determination.
he
designated
only
certain
films
for
seizure,
and
only
those
films
were
taken.
further,
the
term
"scrupulous
exactitude"
seems
to
be
contradictory
to
the
term
"probable
cause".
how
can
we
ever
be
exact
about
what
supposedly
is
appeals
probable,
and
that
was
the
question
the
court
of
was
determining.
more
importantly,
the
court
of
appeals
aired
in
applying
a
prior
restraint
analysis
to
this
case.
no
prior
restraint
was
demonstrated.
no
substantial
restraint
was
demonstrated.
and
in
fact,
the
record
indicates
that
there
ware
available
safeguards
to
prevent
any
type
of
substantial
restraint.
mr.
john
j.
defranks
or
even
one,
if
it's
the
only
offering
of
a
movie
theater,
i
would
suggest,
that
might--
--well
be
a
substantial
restraint,
if
it's
not
replaceable.
mr.
john
j.
defranks
indeed,
85
days
after
the
seizure
there
was
an
assertion
that,
"these
were
our
only
copies".
there
was
no
demonstration,
though,
that
they
couldn't
have
been
replaced,
that
others
could
not
have
been
made
available
through
the
distributor.
these
videocassettes
are
mass
production
items.
they
come
in
mass
produced
boxes
with
descriptions
and
pictures
on
the
outside.
it's
clear
they're
not
unique.
we
are
not
talking
about
a
first-run
film,
in
this
particular
case.
it's
important
to
note
that
no
injunction
or
order
against
further
dissemination
was
ever
contemplated,
nor
was
an
order
of
destruction
ever
contemplated
in
this
case.
mr.
john
j.
defranks
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
defranks
there's
an
obligation
not
only
to
provide
a
hearing,
adversarial
under
heller,
but
there's
an
obligation
to
allow
him
to
copy
it.
if
the
copying
process
is
not
good
enough,
we
must
return
to
him
the
original.
mr.
john
j.
defranks
it
was
determined
under
heller
that
there
need
not
be
a
pre-seizure
adversarial
hearing.
i
believe
it
was
also
determined
in
helller
that
he's
entitled
to
a
post-seizure
adversarial
hearing
upon
his
request.
mr.
john
j.
defranks
yes.
mr.
john
j.
defranks
was
not
done,
and
i
submit
the
burden--
mr.
john
j.
defranks
--copies
would
have
been
made,
of
course.
copies
would
have
been
made.
mr.
john
j.
defranks
in
preparation
for
trial
he
requested,
30
days
after
the
seizure,
inspection
and/or
copying
to
prepare
for
trial.
it
had
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
continued
dissemination.
of
course,
it
came
some
time
after
the
seizure.
we
responded
by
saying,
what
you
want,
if
you
want
inspection
you're
welcome
to
come
and
inspect
it
any
time
you
want.
but
he
never,
upon
our
response,
said,
"well,
i
have
to
have
copies
to
disseminate,
to
provide
the
public
with
access
to
these
materials.
"
so,
we
submit
that
under
heller
he
has
not
demonstrated
a
substantial
restraint.
mr.
john
j.
defranks
that's
indeed
what
heller
says,
and
we
would
have
been
compelled
to
do
so.
mr.
john
j.
defranks
for
the
warrant
to
be
sufficient,
i
would
contend
that
the
affiant
should
indicate
that
he's
reviewed
the
entire
film.
he
should
attempt
to
describe--
mr.
john
j.
defranks
--at
least
an
inference.
you
should
be
able
to
draw
from
the
evidence
an
inference
as
to
each
element,
the
three-prong
test.
mr.
john
j.
defranks
yes,
and
i
would
submit
that
they
have.
mr.
john
j.
defranks
by
inference,
yes.
with
respect
to
the
safeguards,
i
did
want
to
point
out
one
more
safeguard
because
it
goes
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
something
material
might
have
been
left
out
of
this
film.
it
was
the
focus
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
and
the
focus
of
my
opponent
below,
at
least
with
regard
to
one
of
his
arguments,
that
perhaps
one
of
the
elements
had
not
been
proved
by
the
affidavit.
perhaps
it
could
not
even
infer...
something,
what
they
were
suggesting
was
something--
mr.
john
j.
defranks
--yes.
the
affidavits
were
talking
about
are
in
the...
attached
to
the
dissenting
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
they
would
be
at
825.
mr.
john
j.
defranks
as
i
was
saying,
the
focus
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
that
something
might
have
been
left
out
in
this
case.
we
would
submit
that
this
court's
decision
in
franks
versus
delaware
operates
as
the
perfect
safeguard
for
that
type
of
complaint,
because
under
franks
he
could
have
demonstrated
that
something
material
had
been
left
out,
relative
to
one
of
the
elements
of
the
crime.
it
would
have
forced
a
viewing
of
the
film,
based
upon
his
contention
that
there
was
a
reckless
disregard
for
the
truth.
it's
interesting,
in
new
york
we
have
three
reviewing
courts
concerned
with
this
case.
no
court,
up
to
this
point,
has
ever
seen
the
materials
that
are
the
subject
of
this
petition.
we
submit
that
nothing
in
this
case
justifies
the
elevated
standard
required
by
the
court
of
appeals.
there
was
no
prior
restraint.
there
was
no
substantial
restraint.
there
was
no
mass
seizure
as
is
contended.
there
was
not
even
a
violation
of
anyone's
privacy
interest.
we
submit
that
in
light
of
those
factors,
probable
cause
should
be
the
standard,
probable
obscenity,
and
we
contend
that
the
affidavits
in
this
case
demonstrate
probable
obscenity
as
to
the
three
prongs
of
the
miller
test.
first,
the
affidavits
are
introduced
by
the
statement,
"the
following
describes
the
content
and
character
of
the
films.
"
all
the
films
are
denominated
as
adult
films,
indicative
of
their
strong
sexual
content.
from
eight
to
15
sexual
acts
found
offensive
by
any
constitutional
standard
by
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
are
described
in
these
affidavits.
the
court
of
appeals
had
no
problem
with
respect
to
the
second
prong
of
the
miller
test.
common
sense
indicates
that
where
there
are
so
many
acts
performed
in
the
course
of
a
film,
and
that
these
arts
must
consume
a
substantial
period
of
time,
the
film
must
have
as
its
predominant
appeal
the
prurient
interest
in
sex.
mr.
john
j.
defranks
yes,
they
do,
but
there
are
affidavits
we
are
concerned
with
which
do
not
go
in
succession
either.
at
one
point
the
affiant
says,
another
scene
rather
than
the
following
scene,
et
cetera,
your
honor.
these
films...
these
affidavits,
excuse
me,
give
not
a
single
clue
as
to
any
redeeming
literary,
artistic,
political
or
scientific
value,
and
indeed
none
could
be
expected
based
on
the
predominance
of
the
sexual
activity
in
the
affidavits.
mr.
john
j.
defranks
yes,
it
is.
mr.
john
j.
defranks
i
would
think
that
under
leon
this
warrant
and
seizure
would
be
upheld.
my
problem
is
that
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
has
rejected
the
good
faith
exception
to
the
warrant
requirement.
thus,
if
the
case
were
determined
on
a
good
faith
basis
and
i
remanded,
i'd
be
a
loser.
mr.
john
j.
defranks
yes.
given
that
the
magistrate
credited
the
assertions
of
the
affiant
in
this
case,
and
there
being
no
reason
for
anyone
to
suggest
that
something
was
left
out
of
these
affidavits,
i
think
it's
fair
and
it's
reasonable
to
conclude
that
the
films
demonstrated
probable
obscenity.
lastly,
in
conclusion,
i
assert
and
we
request
that
affidavits
be
accepted
as
a
legitimate
basis
upon
which
to
found
a
probable
cause
determination
in
an
obscenity
case.
mandatory
viewing
of
every
frame
of
every
film
would
severely
tax
an
already
overladen
judiciary.
further,
the
affidavits
can
be
supplemented
by
inquiry
by
the
judge.
he
can
make
inquiry
of
the
affiant.
this
court's
determination
that
the
review
of
obscenity
requires
a
focused
search
implies
that
there
should
be
interrogation,
in
fact,
when
the
magistrate
has
some
concern
as
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
affidavits.
i
think
more
importantly,
though,
the
existence
of
the
safeguards
to
prevent
substantial
restraint,
in
this
case
render
reasonable
the
use
of
affidavits
to
determine
probable
cause,
in
conclusion,
i
ask
this
court--
mr.
john
j.
defranks
--yes,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
defranks
well,
i'm
asking
two
things.
number
one,
whether...
this
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
an
elevated
standard
has
been
imposed.
mr.
john
j.
defranks
well,
i
would
ask
that
if
it
were
determined
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
applying
a
probable
cause
standard,
and
i
don't
believe
that
that's
the
case,
i
would
ask
that
you
review
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
here
as
you
did
in
gates.
mr.
john
j.
defranks
the
same
as
you
did
in
gates,
make
a
legal
determination
as
to
their
legal
sufficiency.
mr.
john
j.
defranks
as
to
each
of
these
movies.
mr.
john
j.
defranks
well,
first
i
would
refer
the
court
to
page
a-7
where
they
refer
to
their
standard.
this
would
be
footnote
3
at
a-7.
that's
the
majority
referring
to
the
standard
as
being
rejected
unanimously.
mr.
john
j.
defranks
all
right.
i
would
submit
that
page...
the
top
paragraph
of
page
a-7,
the
court
there
indicates
that
the
affidavits
are
ambiguous,
equivocal.
we
submit
that
to
determine
probable
cause
there
always
is
going
to
be
some
equivocalness
of
the
information
because
we
can't
determine,
at
least
to
a
prima
facie
standard
or
to
a
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
that
the
films
are
obscene.
mr.
john
j.
defranks
as
we
suggest,
they
pay
lip
service
to
probable
cause
and
as
the
dissent--
mr.
john
j.
defranks
--yes.
mr.
john
j.
defranks
yes.
as
the
dissenter
points
out,
they
were
asking
for
an
unequivocal
demonstration
of
obscenity
to
establish
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
material
was
obscene.
mr.
john
j.
defranks
no,
but
i
think
that
the
statement
at
page
a-7
can
be
interpreted
as
saying,
it
must
be
unambiguous.
they
criticized
our
affidavits
for
being
ambiguous.
the
result
is
that
they
must
be
demanding
unambiguous
affidavits.
mr.
john
j.
defranks
yes.
mr.
john
j.
defranks
in
avoiding
what
this
court
has
said
about
deference
to
the
magistrate.
in
conclusion,
i
would
urge
that
this
court
recognize
that
there
was
no
mass
seizure
here
and
that
probable
obscenity
is
the
standard,
that
therefore
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
reversed.
mr.
john
j.
defranks
the
chill
here,
your
honor,
is
the
fact
that
once
a...
this
is
not,
first
of
all,
an
adult
bookstore.
this
is
not
a
yellow
front
bookstore.
this
is
a
place
where
films
are
rented
to
the
public
from
stagecoach
and
citizen
kane,
all
the
way
to
some
of
films
that
are
listed
here
in
this
piece
of
litigation.
and
so,
when
someone
is
given
a
search
warrant
and
they
take
not
simply
one
copy
for
evidentiary
purposes
but
all
the
copies
that
they
could
find,
and
in
this
case
you'll
see
and
the
record
shows
that
they
took
two
copies
when
they
found
two
copies,
and
they
took
one
copy
when
they
found
one
copy,
and
the
police
had
already
copied
themselves
all
of
these
tapes
prior
to
the
time
they
executed
their
search
warrant.
they
had
no
reason
to
take
these
particular
tapes
if
they
were
simply
interested
in
evidence
versus
interested
in
something
beyond
evidence
which
would
necessitate
them
taking
all
the
copies
that
were
available.
mr.
john
j.
defranks
i
think
it
makes
this
difference,
if
i
might,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
the
goverment
here
takes
the
position
that
franks
v.
delaware
applies,
which
i
submit
it
doesn't,
then
in
order
to
achieve
a
hearing
under
that
issue,
under
franks
v.
delaware,
don't
i
have
to
show
that
there's
a
reckless
disregard
for
the
truth
or
that
there's
an
intentional
misstatement
of
the
facts?
now,
if
i'm
in
a
position
where
they
have
a
person
who
goes
in,
who
doesn't
even
recite
in
his
affidavit
that
he's
familiar
with
the
fact
that
there
are
three
prongs
to
statute,
then
how
can
i
attribute
to
that
individual
the
reckless
disregard
for
sensitivity
to
the
three
prongs,
or
an
intentional
statement
on
the
part
of
that
individual
that
they
left
out
information
which
would
have
borne
upon
the
other
two
prongs
of
the
test?
mr.
john
j.
defranks
i
would
like
to
just
make
one
point,
with
regard
to
franks
versus
delaware.
if
the
affiant
were
to
leave
out
the
music
of
hair,
the
dancing
of
another
particular
film,
that
would
qualify
as
a
reckless
disregard,
he
couldn't
be
faithful
to
a
performance
and
leave
out
something
like
that,
and
that's
the
way
the
third
prong
is
proven,
by
omission.
even
when
the
magistrate
reviews
the
film
there's
nothing
that
lights
up
the
screen
and
says
there
are
are
no
literary,
artistic,
political
of
scientific
value.
it's
one
that's
done
by
omission.
mr.
john
j.
defranks
well,
they
weren't
all
firsthand.
mr.
john
j.
defranks
they
were...
having
rented
it
and
not
returned
it
during
a
certain
period,
that
might
well
he
considered
a
seizure
had
we
not
returned
it
pursuant
to
the
rental
agreement,
seizure
