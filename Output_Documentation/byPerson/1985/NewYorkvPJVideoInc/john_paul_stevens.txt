mr.
defrank,
do
we
have,
to
read
the
dissent
to
understand
the
majority
opinion,
do
you
think?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
not
asking
us
to
review
the
affidavits
themselves
to
decide
whether
there
is
probable
cause,
are
you?
as
i
understand
the
question
presented,
the
question
is
whether
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law
something
more
than
probable
cause
is
required,
and
that
is
all
you
are
asking
us
to
decide?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
we
read
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
and
i
was
looking
at
page
a-7
right
after
the
footnote
you
refer
to,
and
they
are
talking
about,
probable
cause
can
or
cannot
be
inferred.
supposing
we
read
the
opinion
as
just
having
not
applied
an
elevated
standard
of
probable
cause,
contrary
to
the
dissent's
view,
that's
one
reading,
what
would
you
ask
us
to
do
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
want
us
to
review
each
of
these
affidavits
and
then
render
an
opinion
on
whether
that's
probable
cause?
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
to
each
of
these
movies?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
is
it
in
the
opinion...
could
you
tell
me
where
you
think
the
majority
makes
it
most
clear
that
they
are
applying
an
elevated
standard,
without
regard
to
what
the
dissent
says
about
it,
because
sometimes
i
think
it's
a
mistake
to
rely
on
other
opinions
to
interpret
the
majority.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
referring
to
what
the
dissent
said.
it
said,
dissent
doesn't
cite
any...
but
is
there
anything
in
the
text
of
the
opinion
that
supports
your
view
that
they
have
applied
anything
other
than
a
probable
cause
standard?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
right
after
the
footnote
on
page
3,
they
say,
"probable
cause
cannot
be
inferred
from
the
title
of
an
hour
and
a
half
long
a
film,
or
from
the
description
of
a
few
scenes.
"
but
they
seem
to
be
trying
to
determine
probable
cause,
which
concerns
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
agree
they
do
pay
lip
service
to
the
probable
cause
standard?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
say
they
misapplied
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
say
that,
but
their
opinion
doesn't
say
they're
asking
for
an
unequivocal
demonstration
of
obscenity,
does
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
you
a
question
before
you
sum
up,
mr.
cambria.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
the
question
presented
in
the
cert
petition,
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
some
way
where
i
don't
have
to
decide
whether
there's
probable
cause
in
all
these
affidavits,
because
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
be
something
i
should
have
to
do
in
a
case
like
this.
do
you
agree
the
issue
is
just
what
standards
should
be
applied
in
reviewing
the
affidavits
that
we
have
to
decide
under
the
questions
presented,
and
if
so,
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
applied...
required
more
than
a
showing
of
probable
cause?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
recognize
that,
buy
what
about
the
sentence
at
the
bottom
of
a-4,
because
there
was
seizure
based
upon
ideas,
that
was
based
upon
ideas,
they
contain...
there
is
a
higher
standard
for
evaluation
of
a
warrant
application
seeking
to
seize
such
things
as
books
and
films
as
opposed
to--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
you
another
question
that
puzzles
me
about
this
litigation.
i
wonder
what
you
accomplish
by
your
motion
to
suppress.
supposing
you
won
your
motion
to
suppress
and
they
suppressed
the
stuff
pursuant
to
a
warrant,
and
then
you
still
go
to
trial.
can't
they
just
go
rent
the
movie
and
put
it
in
evidence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
respondent...
these
people
who
made
up
the
affidavit
know
what
the
movies
are,
and
i
guess
they're
on
the
market.
i
don't
understand
why
you
have
to
have
such
a
big
fight
to
suppress
this
stuff.
justice
john
paul
stevens
from
either
side,
i
mean,
i
don't
know
what
you
gained.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
be
as
much
of
a
chill
as
being
found
guilty
or
the
basis
of...
i
assume
some
of
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
fact,
he
says
you
did
that,
is
that
right?
and
saved
us
all
this
trouble.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
had
the
copies,
then
why
did
you
have
to
fight
about
the
suppression?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
copies
were
not
legible,
is
that
what
it
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
it's
harder
to
verify
copies
than
to
come
to
the
united
states
supreme
court
on
an
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
correct
that
the
only
purpose
of
the
seizure
was
for
use
as
evidence?
there
was
no
attempt
to
try
to
discourage
the
business
before
there
was
a
trial
on
the
merits?
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
at
all?
