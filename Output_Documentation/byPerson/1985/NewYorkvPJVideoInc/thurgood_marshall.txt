let's
take--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--a
different
kind
of
case.
a
police
officer
comes
in
and
says
"i
saw
joe
blow
shoot
and
kill
john
jones,
and
i
want
a
warrant
for
his
arrest.
"
is
that
enough--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--doesn't
have
to
do
anything
about...
doesn't
hays
to
do
anything
at
all
about
the
merits.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that's
sufficient?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
beg
your
pardon.
he
didn't
say
"premeditated".
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
would
not
simple
obscenity
be
enough?
justice
thurgood
marshall
have
you
anything
else
to
go
along
with
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
have
you
anything
else
to
bolster
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that's
only
true
for
first
amendment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
attorney
general,
why
didn't
you
buy
a
copy
of
this
and
renew...
re-open
the
case
rather
than
bothering
us
with
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
didn't
have--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--well,
couldn't
you
have
rented
it
long
enough
to
copy
it?
