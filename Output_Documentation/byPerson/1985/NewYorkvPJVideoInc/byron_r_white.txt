if
it
had
been
done,
copies
would
have
been
made?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
he
wanted
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there
was
only
one
copy
in
the
first
place,
i
suppose
all
you're
obligated
to
do
is
to
get
that
back
to
him.
you
make
a
copy
for
yourself
and
give
them
one
copy
back?
justice
byron
r.
white
by
the
way,
can
you
help
me
find
the
affidavit?
justice
byron
r.
white
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
affidavits
purport
to
describe
each
scene
in
succession.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
isn't
in
the
record...
the
record
doesn't
show
what
the
magistrate
thought,
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
he
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
may
not,
but
you're
not
suggesting
that
the
magistrate
didn't
know
about
what
the
cases
required?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
magistrate
read
the
affidavit
and
let's
assume
the
magistrate
said,
i
know
all
about
these
three
prongs
and
i've
read
all
these
affidavits
and
i
infer
that
all...
there's
probable
cause
to
believe
that
all
three
prongs
are
satisfied.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
must
assume
that's
what...
that
he
did
that,
at
the
minimum.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
state
court
did
decide
this
as
a
federal
question,
didn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
was
decided
as
a
federal
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we
just
shouldn't
ever
have
granted
this?
