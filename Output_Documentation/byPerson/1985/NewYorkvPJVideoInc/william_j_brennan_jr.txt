tell
me,
mr.
cambria,
do
you
think
that
it
was
the
magistrate's
duty
to
see
the
motion
pictures?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
agree
to
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
ordinarily
do
you
think
the
magistrate
should
see
the
films?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
has
to
do
that
before
he
decides
whether
to
issue
the
warrant?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
this
were
a
federal
issue,
is
there
any
case
of
ours
that
says
that?
