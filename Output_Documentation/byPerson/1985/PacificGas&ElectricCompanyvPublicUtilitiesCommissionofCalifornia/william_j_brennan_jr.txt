justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
this
argument
suggest,
mr.
harris,
that
the
puc
order
that
we
have
before
us,
you
would
not
object
to
it
if
they
permitted
turn
to
insert
only
factual
matter
that
dealt
with
the
public
utility
business?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
asked
you
that
question
because
i
thought
you
answered
justice
o'connor
that
the
puc
could
require
you
to
insert
matter
that
dealt
with
rates.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
is
the
death
or
die
or
whatever.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
going
so
far
as
to
suggest
that
a
corporation's
negative
first
amendment
right,
as
you
perceive,
is
co-extensive
with
the
individual?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
makes
no
difference
whether
it
is
an
individual
or
a
corporation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
flyers
for
candidates
for
public
office?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
i
understand
you
to
answer
justice
o'connor
that
a
corporation
has
no
first
amendment
right
to
refuse
to
carry
the
message
of
somebody
else
if
ordered
by
the
public
utility
commission?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
what
principle,
first
amendment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
an
incorporated
church?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
about
the
john
birch
society?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
is
a
corporation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
such
as
the
naacp?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
you
couldn't
really
mean
to
say
that
an
old
case
is
a
corporation
and
a
right
under
the
first
amendment
to
refuse
to
carry
somebody
else's
message.
