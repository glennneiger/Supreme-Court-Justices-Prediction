mr.
harris,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
your
are
ready
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
there
is
a
difference
between
a
newspaper,
which
is
not
a
regulated
enterprise,
and
a
public
utility,
which
is
quite
strictly
regulated,
a
difference
for
these
purposes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
but
hasn't
the
court
distinguished
between
different
kinds
of
media?
the
red
lion
case,
for
example,
involving
the
fairness
doctrine
who
was
dealing
with
the
broadcast
station
which
is
regulated
in
a
sense
and
yet
the
broadcasters
are
required
to
do
certain
things.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
a
citizens'
committee
is
organized
in
favor
of
public
ownership
of
all
utilities.
under
this
order,
could
that
committee
put
its
material
out
through
the
monthly
bills?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
some
group
came
in
with
material,
information,
propaganda,
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
about
tariffs,
urging
that
tariffs
be
put
on
all
imports
from
japan.
would
the
commission
have
the
authority
to
have
that
circulated?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
fogelman?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
raise
your
voice
some,
mr.
fogelman?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
to
some
extent,
for
the
stop
orders
too,
isn't
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
doesn't
it
produce
the
revenue?
isn't
there
some
reduction
of--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--well,
aren't
the
operating
expenses
shared
by
the
rate
payers
and
the
stockholders?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
are
the
limits
on
how
this
authority
of
the
commission
can
be
used?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
who
is
going
to
define
those
limits?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
someone
comes
in
and
says
here
is
a...
in
the
next
election
there
is
going
to
be
a
recall
of
three
state
supreme
court
justices
on
the
ballot
and
we
aren't
taking
any
position
as
to
whether
they
should
be
recalled
or
not
recalled,
but
here
we
want
this
message
put
in
that
you
should
be
sure
to
vote
on
this
because
that
is
a
exercise
of
your
right
to
control
your
public
servants,
including
the
courts.
would
the
commission
let
that
go
in?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
didn't
get
that,
under
what?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
narrow
that
down
to
a
little
narrower
question
than
justice
brennan's.
take
a
regulated,
a
regulated
activity,
the
three
major
commercial
networks.
could
the
federal
communications
commission
come
down
with
an
order
and
have
it
constitutionally
enforced
providing
that
no
prime
minister
of
any
other
country
or
any
chief
of
state
of
any
other
country
could
be
on
the
television
program
unless
it
was
approved
by
the
state
department?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
are
both
regulated
industries.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
a
broadcast
station,
not
necessarily
a
network...
a
broadcasting
station
is
more
regulated
than
the
electric
utility
in
the
sense
that
the
federal
communications
commission
can
terminate
their
license
and
put
them
off
the
air
every
three
years,
i
think
it
is.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
pretty
heavy
regulation,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
we
not
sustain
the
right
of
columbia
broadcasting
system
to
reject
certain
paid
ads
because
they
said
it
wasn't
necessary
to
get
the
information
out,
democratic
committee
against
columbia
broadcasting?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
was
under
the
fairness
doctrine.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
harris?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
