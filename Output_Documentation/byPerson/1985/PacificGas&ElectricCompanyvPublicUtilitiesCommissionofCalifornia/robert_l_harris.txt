mr.
robert
l.
harris
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
comes
from
the
state
of
california
which
has
order
pacific
gas
and
electric
company
to
include
in
its
monthly
billing
envelope
the
fund
solicitation
messages
of
a
third
party.
we
are
required
to
include
the
message
four
times
per
year
for
a
two-year
period.
for
the
past
60
years,
pg&e
has
used
the
billing
envelope
to
communicate
its
message
through
the
pg&e
progress.
the
envelope
has
never
been
open
to
the
public.
the
california
supreme
court
refused
to
hear
appellant's
petition
for
writ
of
review,
thus
upholding
the
commission's
decision.
that
decision
was
appealed
to
this
court,
which
noted
probable
jurisdiction.
the
issue
presented
on
appeal
is
whether
or
not
the
state
of
california
can,
consistent
with
the
first
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution,
compel
pacific
gas
and
electric
company,
a
privately
owned,
public
utility,
to
include
in
its
monthly
billing
envelope
the
fund
solicitation
of
a
third
party,
in
this
case,
turn,
toward
utility
rate
normalization.
utility
speech
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
in
consolidated
edison,
this
court
decided
in
1980
that
the
state
of
new
york
could
not
regulate
the
political
speech
that
consolidated
edison
put
in
the
billing
envelope
unless
the
state
showed
a
compelling
state
interest
for
that
regulation.
the
right
not
to
carry
the
message
of
others
applies,
indeed,
to
a
corporation.
mr.
robert
l.
harris
first
national
bank
of
boston
versus
bellotti,
decided
in
1978.
in
that
case,
this
court
was
faced
with
the
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
the
corporation
was
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
was
the
first
time
the
issue
was
squarely
presented
to
this
court.
and,
justice
powell
writing
for
the
court,
said
that
the
inherent
worth
of
speech
is
not
determined
by
identity.
he
said
that
you
look
not
to
the
identity
of
the
person
who
is
asserting
the
right,
you
look
to
see
if
the
right
that
is
being
asserted
is
a
right
that
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
robert
l.
harris
that
case
was
not
faced
with
that
issue.
mr.
robert
l.
harris
it
did
not
hold
that
a
person
had
a
right...
that
a
corporation
had
a
right
not
to
carry
somebody
else's
message.
mr.
robert
l.
harris
there
is
no
case
that
specifically
holds
that
in
the
case
of
a
corporation,
however,
we
do
rely
heavily
upon
at
least
two
cases,
miami
herald
versus
tornillo
and
wooley
versus
maynard.
in
the
miami
herald
case,
the
court
held
that
the
state
of
florida
could
not
compel
the
miami
herald
to
publish
the
reply
messages
of
third
parties
and
in
that
decision
chief
justice
burger,
writing
for
the
court,
indicated
that
although
the
state
of
florida
made
good
arguments
in
terms
of
why
a
wide
variety
of
views
are
necessary
or
desired,
but
the
court
says
in
each
instance
where
there
is
an
enforced
right
of
excess...
access...
necessarily
calls
for
some
mechanism,
either
consentual
or
governmental.
mr.
robert
l.
harris
for
these
purposes,
i
think
that
the
same
principle
that
applies
in
tornillo
should
apply
here.
the
mere
fact
of
regulation,
as
this
court
indicated
in
consolidated
edison,
does
not
preclude
a
utility
from
asserting
first
amendment
rights.
in
tornillo,
the
difference,
of
course,
is
that
tornillo
involved
a
newspaper.
here
we
are
involved
with
a
situation
where
you
have
a
utility's
billing
envelope.
but,
the
principle
is
the
same;
that
is,
as
the
court
said
in
tornillo,
newspapers
should
not
be
compelled
to
publish
that
which
reason
tells
them
should
not
be
published.
here
a
utility
should
not
be
compelled
to
carry
a
message
in
the
billing
envelope
that
reason
tells
it
should
not
be
carried.
mr.
robert
l.
harris
in
the
case
of
red
lion,
there
red
lion
did
not
rest
upon
the
basis
that
the
broadcasters
had
a
monopoly.
it
rested
rather
upon
the
basis
that
they
were
using
a
scarce
resource
that
was
not
open
to
the
public.
here,
the
mail
is
not
a
scarce
resource.
and,
as
the
court
reasoned
in
red
lion,
and
again
emphasized
in
consolidated
edison,
is
that
a
broadcaster
can
only
communicated
through
those
scarce
resources.
mr.
robert
l.
harris
justice
o'connor,
we
have,
indeed,
carried
such
notices.
we
are
willing
to
do
that.
mr.
robert
l.
harris
yes,
we
do
concede
that.
mr.
robert
l.
harris
that
is
different
because
in
the
case
of
a
government
notice,
here
an
informational
notice,
informing
utility
customers
that
a
hearing
is
going
to
be
on
such
and
such
date
or
that
there
is
a
public
health
or
safety
matter
pending
somewhere
concerning
the
utility,
it
is
quite
different
from
compelling
pg&e
to
carry
in
its
billing
envelope
the
fund
raising
message
of
a
third
party
unregulated
by
the
commission,
a
third
party
who
is
free
to--
mr.
robert
l.
harris
--no,
it
would
not,
justice
brennan.
we
would
object
to
it
because
we
would
be
forced
to
carry--
mr.
robert
l.
harris
--as
i
understand
justice
o'connor,
it
was
whether
or
not
we
could
be
compelled
to
carry
a
state's
notice.
as
i
understand
your
question,
it
is
whether
or
not
we
can
be
compelled
to
carry
a
private
person's
notice.
mr.
robert
l.
harris
and,
no,
we
cannot,
i
don't
think,
consistent
with
the
first
amendment
unless
the
state
shows
a
compelling
state
interest
for
ordering
us
to
do
it.
we
rely
on
wooley
versus
maynard.
mr.
robert
l.
harris
no,
it
is
not
the
death
or
die.
we
also
rely
on
the
general
principles
of
the
first
amendment
and
that
is
compelling
someone
to
speak
when
there
are
other
ways
available.
mr.
robert
l.
harris
yes.
i
think
that
this
court
intimated
that
to
a
certain
extent
in
harper
and
row
versus
nation
enterprise
by
justice
o'connor
where
she
indicated
and
cited
really
that
the
right
to
speak
also
necessarily
includes
the
right
not
to
speak.
and
then
she
quotes
new
york's
chief
judge
poole
in
terms
of
how
they
serve
the
same
ultimate
purpose.
the
purpose
that
is
being
served
here
is
the
right
not
to
be
compelled
to
carry
someone
else's
message.
mr.
robert
l.
harris
i
don't
think
it
is
any
different
at
all
whether
it
is
an
individual
or
a
corporation.
you
cannot
look
and
say
in
the
one
instance
this
is
a
corporation,
therefore,
you
carry
the
message
without
regard
to
anything
else.
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
nature
of
a
right
involved.
is
that
right
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
here,
the
right
involved
is
the
right
not
to
carry
the
message
of
someone
else.
mr.
robert
l.
harris
i
think
there
is
a
difference.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
difference
whether
it
is
a
utility
or
any
other
corporation.
mr.
robert
l.
harris
yes,
indeed,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
harris
yes,
there
is
a
difference
if
it
is
the
message
of
the
state.
if
it
is
a
message
of
a
third
party,
then
i
would
disagree.
mr.
robert
l.
harris
it
is
true
that
the
commission
below
held
that
the
extra
space
does
not
belong
to
the
individual.
mr.
robert
l.
harris
doesn't
belong
to
the
utility.
mr.
robert
l.
harris
sorry.
mr.
robert
l.
harris
it
doesn't
matter
because
what
we
are
talking
about
is
the
regulation
of
what
goes
into
the
billing
envelope.
mr.
robert
l.
harris
it
is
true
that
that
is
what
the
commission
held.
but,
we
argue
that
the
first
amendment
cannot
depend
upon
a
metaphysical
definition
of
space.
mr.
robert
l.
harris
what
we
are
talking
about,
justice
white,
in
addition--
mr.
robert
l.
harris
--if
the
question
is
who
gets
a
free
ride,
the
commission
can
certainly
deal
with
that
question
by
assessing
an
economic
value
to
that
extra
space.
but,
here,
in
order
for
the
consumer
group
to
use
that
space,
they
must
use
an
envelope,
an
envelope
that
the
commission
has
not
said
belongs
to
the
rate
payer.
and,
in
using
that
envelope
we
are
compelled
to
associate,
we
are
compelled
to
be
the
courier
of
someone
else's
message
and
we
think
that
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
robert
l.
harris
i
think
it
is
very,
very
close.
mr.
robert
l.
harris
they
are
not
identical,
no.
mr.
robert
l.
harris
we
don't
know,
your
honor.
that
wasn't
part
of
the
record
below.
but,
i
would
suspect
that
many
consumers
will
object,
because
there
are
many
consumer
groups.
mr.
robert
l.
harris
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
that
would
clearly
reverse
consolidated
edison.
mr.
robert
l.
harris
but,
the
outcome
of
this
case
does
not
turn
upon
who
owns
the
extra
space.
mr.
robert
l.
harris
well,
i
don't
think
it
necessarily
turns
on
who
owns
the
envelope
either.
mr.
robert
l.
harris
the
envelope
has
not
been
held
to
be
the
property
of
the
rate
payer.
the
envelope
carries
the
name
of
pg&e.
the
envelope
is
material
that
we
must
send
to
the
rate
payer.
whatever
is
in
that
envelope
is
associated
with
pg&e.
mr.
robert
l.
harris
then
the
association
would
become
even
worse
because
there
you
have
both
pg&e
and
turn
being
the
sender
of
the
bill.
the
purpose
of
the
billing
envelope
is
to
send
a
bill.
even
aside
from
any
other
document
included
therein,
it
is
the
forced
association,
the
forced
compulsion
to
speak
when
we
prefer
not
to
speak
that
is
at
issue
here.
mr.
robert
l.
harris
it
is
not
the
same
personality,
of
course,
but
it
is
the
right
that
is
involved,
the
right
not
to
be
the
courier
of
someone
else's
message
that
i
think
is
at
stake
here.
in
wooley,
live
free
or
die.
here,
we
carry
whatever
the
message
may
be
that
is
given
to
us
from
turn
into
a
billing
envelope
that
we
have
mailed
out
for
over
60
years.
people
associate
what
we
mail
in
the
pg&e
envelope
with
pg&e.
mr.
robert
l.
harris
the
opportunity
to
put
a
disclaimer--
mr.
robert
l.
harris
--under
the
order,
turn
must
put
a
disclaimer.
but,
a
disclaimer
would
not
clear
the
violation.
as
i
indicated,
for
over
60
years
this
has
been
the
pg&e
envelope.
the
forced
association
causes
the
injury.
the
opportunity
to
disclaim
an
inaccurate
or
an
inflammatory
message
will
not
suffice
to
undo
whatever
damage
that
may
have
been
done
by
including
the
message.
the
state
of
california
cited
pruneyard
as
its--
mr.
robert
l.
harris
--no,
it
is--
mr.
robert
l.
harris
--it
is
reputation.
mr.
robert
l.
harris
it
affects
us
in
this
way.
over
the
years,
we
have
expended
a
lot
of
money
building
up
the
image
of
pg&e,
building
up
our
corporate
image.
to
the
extent--
mr.
robert
l.
harris
--no,
your
honor.
we
have
not
even
carried
the
message
of
those
who
support
rate
increases.
we
have
not
carried
the
message
of
anyone
other
than
pg&e,
although
we
have
been
requested
by
numerous
jurisdictions,
including
the
city
and
county
of
san
francisco
to
carry
its
messages.
but,
as
you
can
probably
see,
once
we
become
involved
in
that,
then
we
find
ourselves
irretrievably
entangled
in
a
mess.
this
order
requires
that
the
puc
place
itself
in
the
position
of
selecting
the
speakers.
in
other
words,
who
uses
this
envelope,
whether
it
is
turn
or
some
other
person.
they
must
first
come
to
the
commission,
must
first
indicate
to
the
commission
the
subject
matter
that
it
intends
to
talk
about.
once
it
indicates
that,
then
the
person
must
indicate
whether
or
not
the
viewpoint
expressed
is
one
that
is
in
support
of
pg&e
or
opposed
to
pg&e,
because,
as
the
decision
said,
it
is
the
purpose
to
get
a
variety
of
views
in
addition
and
opposed
to
pg&e.
i
think
the
government
really
will
become
so
entangled,
unlike
in
pruneyard,
in
picking
and
choosing
speakers,
that
government
will
end
up
being
the
ultimate
arbitrator
of
what
is
or
what
is
not
said.
mr.
robert
l.
harris
if
the
commission
so
decrees.
it
is
up
to
the
commission.
under
this
order
the
commission
can
allow
anyone
that
it
pleases
to
use
the
envelope.
all
they
need
do
is
file
a
complaint
and
if
the
commission
believes
that
the
subject
matter
is
proper
or
the
viewpoint
expressed
is
proper,
then
the
commission
will
allow...
will
compel
us
to
carry
that
message.
mr.
robert
l.
harris
no.
it
would
discriminate
against
them.
it
did
that,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
a
year
ago.
a
committee
for
one
million,
proposition
36,
a
jarvis/gann
initiative,
applied
to
the
commission
because
they
wanted
to
indicate
to
rate
payers
that
there
was
a
measure
on
the
ballot
that
would
affect
rate
payers.
but,
the
commission,
and
that
is
in
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement,
said
that
because
it
did
not
directly
relate
to
a
commission
proceeding
that
they
shall
be
denied
and
they
were
denied.
mr.
robert
l.
harris
we
have
carried
commission
notices
concerning
solar
energy
before,
but
we
have
not
been
compelled
to
carry
the
messages,
for
example,
of
a
private
corporation
in
the
solar
industry
who
wants
to
promote
his
particular
device,
as
turn
is
trying
to
promote
its--
mr.
robert
l.
harris
--we
have
not
been
compelled
to
do
that.
mr.
robert
l.
harris
under
this
order,
of
course,
it
would,
but
i
don't
think
that
the
commission
would
necessarily
have
the
authority
to
compel
us
to
carry
that
message
as
promulgated.
i
think
it
is
important
to
remember
that
we
do
not
take
the
position
that
the
commission
can
never
compel
us
to
carry
someone's
message.
we
think
that
when
the
commission
endeavors
to
do
that
the
commission
still
has
to
show
an
overriding
governmental
interest
for
making
us
carry
the
message
that
you
indicate.
and,
in
the
instant
case,
the
commission,
we
don't
think
has
met
its
burden
of
proof
of
showing
that
there
is
a
compelling
state
interest
for
carrying
turn
messages.
the
commission
already
has
california
state
law
which
says
specifically
that
intervenor
funding
can
be
given
to
people
who
intervene
in
rate
cases.
for
example,
the
commission
has
awarded
more
than
$160,000
to
turn
during
the
past
year,
the
last
two
years.
pending
now
before
the
commission
is
an
application
for
over
$800,000
by
some
other
consumer
group.
so,
the
commission
already
has
at
its
disposal
a
very
clear
mechanism
for
taking
care
of
a
problem
that
it
wants
to
resolve.
thus,
there
is
no
reason
for
it
to
broadly
stifle
first
amendment
rights.
there
is
no
reason
for
it
to
compel
pg&e
to
become
the
courier
of
turn's
message.
turn
can
mail
it
to
the
householder.
mr.
robert
l.
harris
from
public.
what
it
does
is
it
will
order
the
utility
to
pay
it
and
then
the
utility
recoups
it
in
its
next
rate
case
that
comes
up.
mr.
robert
l.
harris
attorneys'
fees.
mr.
robert
l.
harris
all
fees
associated
with
the
case.
in
pruneyard
which,
of
course,
is
the
case
which
they
rely
upon
very
heavily,
there
you
had
a
shopping
center,
a
shopping
center
that
was
open
to
the
public
to
come
and
go
as
it
pleased.
some
25,000
people
congregated
their
daily.
there
was
no
requirement
that
government
pick
or
choose
the
speakers.
the
only
requirement
was
that
the
facility...
in
that
case
the
shopping
center...
be
made
available.
but,
here,
in
order
for
government
to
carry
out
its
order,
it
must
become
ensnarled
in
picking
and
choosing
speakers,
precisely
what
the
court
said
in
police
department
of
chicago
versus
mosley.
government
should
not
be
involved
in
picking
and
choosing
speakers.
when
you
have
other
ways
to
accomplish
the
governmental
purpose,
then
government
ought
not
to
be
allowed
to
then
use
means
that
will
broadly
stifle
first
amendment
activities.
here,
unlike
in
pruneyard,
government
did
not
permit
pruneyard,
as
justice
rehnquist
pointed
out,
to
open
those
portions
of
the
shopping
center
that
had
never
been
open
to
the
public.
here,
pg&e
is
required
to
open
its
billing
envelope
that
it
has
never
opened
to
the
public.
the
question
is
basically
one
of
does
it
really
make
sense,
in
view
of
all
these
other
alternatives,
to
compel
pg&e
to
carry
somebody
else's
message
that
can
easily
be
disseminated
in
another
manner.
mr.
robert
l.
harris
we
have
no
problems
with
paying
for
the
extra
space.
we
conceded
that
in
the
court
below,
that
if
that
is
the
governmental
interest
involved,
recoupment...
the
value
of
that
extra
space,
which
it
said
it
was
in
its
decision,
then
there
is
no
reason
why
government
cannot
assess...
let's
say,
for
example,
if
it
is
worth
$300,000
and
probably
charge
that,
assuming
it
is
reasonable,
to
pg&e.
pg&e
would
have
no
constitutional
right
to--
mr.
robert
l.
harris
--that
is
right.
that
is
quite
correct.
mr.
robert
l.
harris
it
would
have
to
be
borne
by
the
stockholders.
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
robert
l.
harris
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
have
just
a
few
notes.
in
regards
to
the
ownership
of
the
extra
space,
we
would
disagree,
as
we
did
in
our
reply
brief
to
their
motion
to
dismiss,
that
that
is
foreclosed.
and,
we
quoted
from
the
california
supreme
court
itself
at
25
cal.
3rd
891,
where
the
court
explained
that
"when
the
issue
is
a
question
of
law
rather
than
a
fact,
the
prior
determination
of.
"
--and
i
am
adding
in
the
word
commission...
"is
not
conclusive
either
if
injustice
would
result
or
if
the
public
interest
requires
that
litigation
not
be
foreclosed.
"
as
we
indicated
earlier,
if
the
california
supreme
court
or
any
other
california
court
decided
that
this
was
critical
in
any
other
proceeding,
it
could
be
relitigated.
mr.
robert
l.
harris
no,
no.
i
just
wanted
to
clear
up
the
record
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
this
is
forever
foreclosed.
mr.
robert
l.
harris
we
certainly
don't
believe
it
is.
first
of
all,
we
believe
it
is
contrary
to
what
this
court
said
in
new
york
public
service
commission
versus
public
board;
that
when
rate
payers
pay
for
service,
they
do
not
pay
for
the
property
used
to
deliver
that
service.
mr.
robert
l.
harris
no.
mr.
robert
l.
harris
no.
we
brought
the
issue
here,
your
honor,
on
the
basis
that
it
infringed
upon
our
first
amendment
rights--
mr.
robert
l.
harris
--even
if
that
ephemeral
concept
of
extra
space,
which
may
be
there
one
month,
may
not
be
there
the
next
month,
it
is
the
putting
of
that
message
in
the
billing
envelope
which
belongs
to
pg&e
that
is
at
issue.
mr.
robert
l.
harris
the
commission
cautioned
us
not
to
do
that,
your
honor,
and
we
would
try
to
be
fair.
[laughter]
but,
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
quite
possible
for
turn
to
use
heavy
paper
for
its
message
and
preclude
us
from
putting
in
progress.
i
think
what
this
case
really
points
out
is
what
this
court
said
in
cohen
versus
california;
that
it
is
the
purpose
of
the
first
amendment
to
remove
government
from
picking
and
choosing
and
from
deciding
who
should
speak,
when
they
should
speak,
etcetera.
i
think
it
is
even
more
important
here,
because
here
the
state
of
california
has
at
its
disposal
many
other
ways
to
resolve
this
problem
and
it
never
has
to
become
involved
in
picking
this
group
or
picking
that
group.
if
the
problem
that
is
bothering
california
that
there
is
some
extra
space
there
where,
as
it
said,
it
is
not
recouping
the
economic
value
of
that
space,
then
let
it
do
what
it
always
does
in
a
rate-making
proceeding,
assess
a
value.
so,
i
think
that
this
case
clearly
comes
down
in
terms
of
saying
that
here
is
a
case
where
government
really
has
gotten
itself
involved
in
a
situation
that
it
will
be
impossible
to
retrieve
itself
from,
picking
and
choosing
speakers.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
