is
there
any
difference
with
a
utility?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
the
state
order
the
utility
to
publish
the
rate
schedule?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
there
is
a
difference.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
about
solar
energy?
i
guess
you
wouldn't
mind
carrying
that,
would
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
the
one
i
was
talking
about.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
fogelman--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--there
are
no
guidelines,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--i
don't
consider
guidelines
that
can
be
inferred.
i
consider
guidelines
as
something
you
can
point
to.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then,
could
you
compel
them
to
carry
an
advertisement
from
the
sun
people
that
want
to
use
that
energy?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
any
other
governmental
agency
in
california
that
can
control
what
a
corporation
may
say?
justice
thurgood
marshall
truth
in
lending.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
other
corporation
is
required
to
carry
something
that
they
don't
want
to
carry?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
isn't
disclosure.
this
is
propaganda.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
freedom
in
lending
doesn't
require
you
to
send
it
to
everybody.
you
are
only
required
to
send
it
to
your
customers.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
these
are
not
freedom-of-lending
customers.
these
are
customers
who
can't
help
themselves.
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
point
is
that
you
see
no
difference
between
a
utility
and
an
ordinary
corporation.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
why
you
want
to
use
it
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
it
were
not
a
utility,
you
wouldn't
be
interested,
would
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
aimed
at
a
utility.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mentioned
the
word
"neutral".
do
you
know
anything
today
in
the
public
view
that
is
neutral?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
would
your
commission
consider
the
use
of
an
ad
during
the
abolishment
of
your
commission?
[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
is
the
state
taking
this
step?
