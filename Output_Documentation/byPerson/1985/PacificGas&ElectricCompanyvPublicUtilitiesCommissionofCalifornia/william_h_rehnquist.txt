justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
case
holds
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
that
case
hold
that
the
kind
of
wooley
versus
maynard
type
of
first
amendment
rights
the
right
not
to
carry
a
message
you
don't
agree
with
applied
to
corporations?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do,
it
didn't
hold
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
what
case
of
ours
do
you
rely
for
that
proposition?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
pg&e
could
change
that
very
easily
if
it
wanted
to
by
saying
pg&e
and
then
adding
turn
to
the
envelope,
i
mean,
if
it
disliked
the
notion
that
it
was
misleading
people.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
don't
you
think
there
is
some
difference
between
the
loyal,
feisty
citizen
of
new
hampshire
who
didn't
believe
in
live
free
or
die
and,
therefore,
didn't
want
to
carry
it
on
his
license
plate,
kind
of
an
individual
type
of
thing
that
always
struck
me,
though
i
must
say
i
didn't
agree
with
the
result
in
that
case,
and
the
corporation.
i
don't
see
quite
the
same
personality
element
there.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can't
you,
under
the
commission's
ruling,
put
a
disclaimer
on
what
you
circulate,
saying
this
is
not
produce
by
pg&e
or
something
like
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--why
is
it
res
judicata
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
essentially
denied
review.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
fogelman,
a
moment
ago
you
made
the
statement
that
under
california
law
denial
of
review
by
the
supreme
court
of
california
is
an
affirmance
on
fact
and
law.
is
that
true
where
the
only
proceeding
below
is
an
agency
proceeding
and
it
has
never
been
to
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
an
example
of
the
sort
of
corporate
first
amendment
right
that
would
be
sustained
the
tornillo
case
where
certainly
the
miami
press
was
a
corporation
and
its
first
amendment
right
to
publish
obviously
allowed
it
not
to
have
to
carry
the
messages
of
others.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no.
the
press
freedom
extends
to
private
individuals
or
corporations
alike.
and,
i
take
it
what
you
are
saying
is
the
since
the
pg&e
is
not
in
the
business
of
running
a
newspaper,
it
isn't
governed
by
that
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
tornillo
come
out
any
differently
if
the
florida
statute
had
said
along
with
the
newspaper
you
have
to
put
in
a
little
envelope
that
you
deliver
the
newspaper
in,
a
retraction.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
in
the
paper
itself.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
seems
to
me
you
are
going
a
lot
further
than
you
have
to
to
win
your
case
here
when
you
start
saying
that,
yes,
the
commission,
of
course,
could
have
stuff
advocating
the
public
ownership
of
utilities.
i
thought
the
commission
allowed
turn
to
come
in
because
turn
is
concerned
with
commission
rate-making
proceedings
and,
i
take
it
there
is
no
proceeding
presently
before
the
commission
about
whether
pg&e
should
be
publicly
owned.
so,
you
really
don't
have
to
get
to
that,
do
you?
