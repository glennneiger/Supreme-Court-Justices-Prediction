have
you
answered
his
question?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
was
under
the
impression
that
the
commission
order
was
limited
to
neutral
messages.
did
it
use
the
word
"neutral"?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
did
the
commission
use
that
term?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
is
your
word?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
the
purposes
of
turn
are
not
entirely
consistent
with
those
of
the
public
utility,
i
understand.
what
is
the
constitutional
bylaw
stated
purposes
were
these?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
to
oppose
rate
increases?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
let's
assume,
for
example...
you
have
had
a
good
many
hypotheticals
posed
to
you
this
afternoon,
but
suppose
the
entity
that
came
along
and
asked
for
permission
for
space
opposed
private
ownership
of
utilities.
would
that
be
a
neutral
message?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
slightly
contrary
to
the
private
utility
point
of
view.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so,
content-neutral
is
not
a
requirement?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
some
justice
asked
you,
is
there
any
limiting
principle...
assume
for
example
that
a
cause
organization
that
wanted
space
urged
the
customers
of
pg&e
to
vote
for
people
like
the
legislature
who
would
support
public
ownership
of
all
utilities.
would
that
be
neutral?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
obviously
not.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
would
it
be
lawful?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
why
would
that
be
contrary
to
miami
herald?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
why
wouldn't
it
be
contrary
to
miami
herald
if
the
commission
permitted
the
sort
of
insert
that
i
described
advocating
public
ownership
of
utilities,
absolutely
contrary
to
the
basic
perception
of
private
utilities?
miami
herald
did
not
want
to
be
a
forum
for
the
views
contrary
to
its
own.
