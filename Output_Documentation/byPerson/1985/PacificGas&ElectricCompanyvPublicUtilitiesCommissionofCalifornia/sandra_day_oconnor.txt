mr.
harris,
do
you
concede
that
the
public
utilities
commission
can
require
pg&e
to
carry
in
its
billing
envelopes
notices
of
public
rate
hearings
or
things
of
that
kind?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
am
asking
if
you
concede
whether
the
public
utilities
commission
can
properly,
under
the
first
amendment,
require
the
company
to
do
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and,
why
is
that
different
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
harris,
isn't
your
general
regulatory
rationale
really
foreclosed
by
the
consolidated
edison
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
seems
very
similar.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
in
some
cases,
the
court
has
indicated
at
least
that
there
is
a
concomitant
right
not
to
speak,
has
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and,
you
take
the
position
that
that
does
not
extend
to
a
corporation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
it
strike
you
that
the
commission's
theory
about
broader
participation
or
expression
of
a
variety
of
views
is
basically
a
content-based
determination?
the
commission
has
to
look
at
what
it
is
that
turn
is
doing
and
wants
to
say
as
the
basis
for
its
order
that
it
be
allowed
to
use
the
envelope.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
certainly
has
to
look
at
the
nature
of
what
turn
is
doing
and
saying
in
order
to
decide
that
it
is
going
to
order
that
its
message
be
carried.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but,
the
principles
are
the
same,
of
course.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
could
the
commission
order
that
any
unused
offices
in
pg&e
buildings
be
turned
over
to
turn
for
its
office
space
and
that
sort
of
thing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
have
the
other
states
that
have
done
this
taken
the
action
that
the
california
commission
did
in
declaring
the
unused
or
extra
space
to
be
rate
payers'
property?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--can
pg&e
just
put
their
bills
on
heavier
paper
and
solve
this
problem?
[laughter]
