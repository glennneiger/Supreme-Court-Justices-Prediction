justice
byron
r.
white
why
shouldn't
it
or
why
doesn't
it
make
a
difference,
as
the
court
below
held,
that
the
extra
space
in
an
envelope
doesn't
belong
to
the
utility?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
doesn't
belong
to
the
utility.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
the
space
doesn't
belong
to
the
utility,
it
belongs
to
the
consumer,
it
was
held
below,
right?
so,
the
commission
said
we
are
going
to
fill
up
that
space
that
belongs
to
the
consumer
with...
periodically
with
something
that
we
think
the
consumer
would
be
more
interested
in.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
does
the
first
amendment
give
the
utility
the
right
to
use
that
space?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
are
talking
about
who
gets
a
free
ride
on
that
space.
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
you
say
the
commission
would
have
the
power
to
order...
to
prevent
the
utility
from
putting
anything
in
the
envelope
except
the
bill?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why?
the
space
doesn't
belong
to
the
utility.
why
should
it
get
a
ride
out
of
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
it
does
on
who
owns
the
envelope.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
the
way
you
are
being
a
courier.
justice
byron
r.
white
turn
has
to
under
the
order.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
the
commission
could
say
to
pg&e,
well,
if
you
are
going
to
use
this
extra
space,
you
ought
to
pay
for
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
is
your
argument.
couldn't
they
recoup
from
the
consumer.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
predicate
for
its
act
was
though
that...
for
the
order
was
that
the
space
belongs
to
the
consumer,
and,
hence,
we
will
act
as
proxy
for
the
consumer
and
send
them
out
something
that
we
think
they
might
be
interested
in.
justice
byron
r.
white
based
on
that
i
wouldn't
think
the
utility...
doesn't
own
the
space,
i
wouldn't
think
the
utility
would
have
standing
to
object
to
whatever
it
was
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree
with
that.
all
i
am
saying
is--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
said
that
although
the
property
matter
was
an
independent
ground
for
decision,
you
don't
think
it
is
necessary
or
important.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
well,
let's
assume
that
the
bill
takes...
there
is
no
spare
space
in
an
envelope
and
the
puc
orders
the
utility
to
use
a
larger
envelope
and
to
let
turn
put
its
material
in
it
as
long
as
turn
pays
for
it.
that
would
be
the
same
case,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
then,
the
commission
really
would
be...
the
company
really
would
be
a
courier
of
somebody
else's
materials.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
suppose
that
your
answer
to
that
question
is
wrong,
that
they
couldn't
make
the
utility
carry
turn's
message
on
those
facts.
would
that
mean
that
you
have
to
lose
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
you
have
to
get
to
the
property
thing.
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
it
is
content-based
because...
at
least
it
says
we
prefer
to
have
turn's
material
in
this
extra
space
than
the
company's.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
it?
isn't
that
right?
it
prefers
turn's
to
the
company's
material.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
may
be
so,
but
when
it
can't
get
into
the
envelope,
can't
use
the
extra
space,
the
commission
has
said
we
prefer
turn's
material
to
go
in
the
extra
space.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
four
times
a
year
it
makes
that
preference.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
based
on
content.
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
it
wants
to
send
out
its
material
that
it
now
can't...
that
under
this
order
it
can't
send
out.
if
it
is
going
to
have
to
do
that,
it
will
have
to
pay
for
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
it
would
cost
them
money.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
just
used
their
general
regulatory
power?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't
ask
us
though
here
to
second
guess
a
state
court
on
what
is
the
property
interest?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
judge
the
case
on
the
basis
of
the
property...
that
that
unused
space
is
the
property
of
the
consumer.
that
is
the
way
the
case
gets
here,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
we
can't
second
guess
the
state
court
on
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
the
property
does
belong
to
the--
