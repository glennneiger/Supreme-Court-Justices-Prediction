mr.
mark
fogelman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
order
to
put
this
case--
mr.
mark
fogelman
--yes,
your
honor.
in
order
to
put
this
case
in
its
proper
perspective,
it
is
important
to
step
back
a
moment
and
look
at
what
the
commission
did
and
why
it
did
it.
pg&e
is
the
largest
investor-owned
gas
and
electric
public
utility
in
the
country.
it
has
a
lawful
and
practical
monopoly
for
the
delivery
gas
and
electric
service
with
in
its
service
area,
which
included
most
of
the
state
of
california.
it
recovers
its
reasonable
costs
and
a
reasonable
rate
of
return
in
rates
paid
by
the
rate
payers.
its
representation
in
commission
rate
cases
is
very
effective.
that
representation
by
some
of
the
best
expert
witnesses,
consultants,
and
lawyers
that
money
can
buy
is
considered
an
operating
expense
to
the
utility
and
is
paid
for
ultimately
by
the
rate
payers.
the
public
utility--
mr.
mark
fogelman
--not
really,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
mark
fogelman
--well,
it
is
an
operating
expense
and
all
of
their
operating
expenses
are
recovered
in
rates,
i
believe.
mr.
mark
fogelman
it
is
my
understanding
that
100
percent
of
operating
expenses
would
be
recovered.
of
course,
costs
which
are
unreasonable
or
imprudent
would
be
disallowed
from
the
rate
base
and
would
be
borne
by
the
shareholders.
mr.
mark
fogelman
the
commission
is
limited
by
its
state-authorized
authority
under
the
state
constitution
and
it
is
limited
by
the
united
states
constitution.
insofar
as
it
does
not
violate
the
principles
of
either
of
those
authorities,
it
is
essentially
free
to
regulate
public
utilities
in
the
public
interest.
with
respect
to
ordering
a
public
utility
to
carry
the
messages
of
a
third
party,
it
is
difficult
to
pose
the
precise
limits.
there
are
probably
many
questions
which
the
commission
ultimately
will
be
required
to
decide
in
pursuing
this
program.
mr.
mark
fogelman
your
honor,
ultimately
the
commission
will
do
so.
mr.
mark
fogelman
well,
under
this
program
they
certainly
wouldn't
and
that
is
the
only--
mr.
mark
fogelman
--under
this
program,
they
certainly
would
not.
mr.
mark
fogelman
because
the
purpose
of
this
program,
the
primary
purpose,
the
reason
why
the
state
has
done
what
it
has
done
here,
is
to
permit
consumer
groups
to
solicit
funds
to
increase
their
participation
in
commission
proceedings
involving
pg&e.
and,
insofar
as
the
access
furthers
that
primary
purpose,
access
would
be
granted.
now,
it
is
possible
that
the
commission
could
enlarge
the
scope
of
the
program.
mr.
mark
fogelman
well,
your
honor--
mr.
mark
fogelman
--your
honor,
there
is
no
question
in
our
mind
that
the
determination
of
rate
payer
property
is
an
independent
basis
for
the
decision.
mr.
mark
fogelman
it
is
res
judicata
here.
mr.
mark
fogelman
however,
we
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference.
mr.
mark
fogelman
it
is
res
judicata
here
because
it
was
decided
in
an
earlier
proceeding
that
the
extra
space
in
the
envelope
is
rate
payer
property.
pg&e
was
a
party
to
that
proceeding,
did
not
take
it
up
to
a
higher
court,
and
in
this
case,
the
commission
refused
to
allow
that
particular
finding
to
be
relitigated.
the
california
supreme
court
essentially
affirmed
the
finding
of
res
judicata.
mr.
mark
fogelman
well,
denial
of
review
is
a
decision
on
the
merits
under
california
law
and
all
questions
of
law
and
fact.
mr.
mark
fogelman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
fogelman
under
this
present
program,
there
are
a
number
of
guidelines.
mr.
mark
fogelman
which
can
be
inferred
from
the
criteria
under
which--
mr.
mark
fogelman
--all
right.
turn
was
permitted
in
the
billing
envelope
because
of
four
characteristics
enunciated
in
the
commission's
decision.
the
first
was
an
ability
to
represent
a
significant
segment
of
the
rate
payer
population.
the
second
was
a
present,
current
involvement
in
proceedings
involving
pg&e.
the
third
was
that
it
was
a
duly
constituted
non-profit
corporation,
and
the
fourth
was
that
it
had
a
financial
hardship
if
it
were
not
permitted
access
in
participating
in
pg&e
proceedings.
mr.
mark
fogelman
those
were
the
characteristics,
yes.
mr.
mark
fogelman
your
honor,
i
think
it
would
be
fair
to
assume
that
since
their
participation
and
their
intention
to
solicit
funds,
specifically
for
the
purpose
of
participation...
in
fact,
there
is
an
auditing
procedure--
mr.
mark
fogelman
--your
honor,
there
are
a
number
of
state
agencies
that
can
do
that?
mr.
mark
fogelman
the
state
banking
commission
regulates
banking.
there
are
truth-in-lending
type
laws,
truth-and-lending
type
disclosure.
mr.
mark
fogelman
in
fact,
the
state
often
requires
speech
to
be
carried.
this
court--
mr.
mark
fogelman
--there
are
many
disclosure
requirements.
the
sec
proxy
statements--
mr.
mark
fogelman
--well,
your
honor,
what
it
is
is
fund
solicitation
messages
which
this
court
in
the
schaumberg
and
the
cornelius
case
indicated
was
fully
protected
speech.
it
involves
the
provision
of
information
and
advocacy
of
causes
and
that
is
all
that
turn
is--
mr.
mark
fogelman
--that
is
the
program.
mr.
mark
fogelman
well,
these
are
customers
of
the
utility.
mr.
mark
fogelman
your
honor,
i
do.
i
think
a
public
utility
is
far
more
heavily
regulated
than
many
corporations.
mr.
mark
fogelman
well,
i
think--
mr.
mark
fogelman
--well,
the
commission
does
regulate
public
utilities.
mr.
mark
fogelman
yes.
mr.
mark
fogelman
yes,
the
consumer
lobby
against
monopolies
case
specifically
holds
that.
i
think
it
is
page
901,
25
cal.
3rd.
mr.
mark
fogelman
well,
i
think
it
doesn't
make
a
difference
to
this
decision,
because
i
believe
that
the
public
utilities
commission,
under
its
broad
regulatory
powers,
has
an
authority
on
the
objective
facts
of
this
case
to
enter
the
order
that
it
did,
even
if
the
space
inside
the
envelope
were
deemed
utility
property.
mr.
mark
fogelman
i
think
that
would
be
a
legitimate
situation.
i
think
also
if
the
rate
payers
paid
for
this
space--
mr.
mark
fogelman
--that
is
right.
basically
the
billing
envelope
is
a
unique
medium
of
communication.
mr.
mark
fogelman
no,
because
if
the
court
were--
mr.
mark
fogelman
--then
you
would
have
to
get
the
the
property
thing
and
that
is
binding
on
this
court
as
a
res
judicata
determination.
mr.
mark
fogelman
no,
it
is
not,
your
honor,
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
mr.
mark
fogelman
well,
the
big
distinction
there
is
that
consolidated
edison
involves
a
restriction
on
utility
speech.
it
is
very
important,
i
think,
for
this
court
to
look
at
the
purposes
of
the
first
amendment
which
underlies
the
difference
between
affirmative
speech
and
negative
speech
rights.
insofar
as
someone
is
attempting
to
speak,
and
the
state
says
you
can't
speak,
you
have
a
situation
where
the
marketplace
of
ideas,
society's
interest
in
obtaining
information,
wide-open
debate,
is
limited
and
that
is
the
consolidated
edison
case.
mr.
mark
fogelman
yes,
it
has,
your
honor.
but,
the
underlying
purposes
which
serve
the
right
not
to
speak,
the
right
to
refrain
from
speaking
and
to
refrain
from
associating
the
views
of
another,
is
very
different
from
the
marketplace
of
ideas
notion.
it
is,
and
this
is
not
to
be
trivialized,
it
is
an
important
purpose.
it
is
the
sanctity
and
integrity
of
an
individual's
belief
and
thought.
it
is
the
interest
that
was
involved
in
barnett--
mr.
mark
fogelman
--i
take
the
position
that
it
does
not
extend
to
a
corporation
which
is
an
artificial
entity.
furthermore,
that
it
certainly
doesn't
extend
to
a
public
utility
which
is
a
very
heavy
regulated
artificial
entity.
furthermore,
i
don't
believe
that
it
is
co-extensive
with
the
affirmative
counterpart
which
serves
entirely
different
interests.
mr.
mark
fogelman
the
order
in
a
broad
sense
is
content-neutral,
because
the
commission
has
disavowed
any
intention
of
looking
at
the
way
that
turn
solicits
funds.
however,
there
is
a
limited
purpose--
mr.
mark
fogelman
--well,
to
the
extent
that
turn's
speech
might
hypothetically...
and,
again,
this
has
never
occurred...
i
might
say
in
a
similar
experience,
the
ucan
situation,
no
problem
certainly
developed
over
a
two-year
period,
but
assuming
that
turn
were
to
exceed
the
purposes
of
the
program
and
to
make...
engage
in
some
sort
of
use
of
the
extra
space,
which
was
not
a
solicitation
of
funds,
in
that
situation
the
commission
would
have
to
look
at
that.
i
am
not
sure
precisely
what--
mr.
mark
fogelman
--what
it
says,
your
honor--
mr.
mark
fogelman
--no.
the
company
gets
in
the
billing
envelope
every
month
of
the
year
and
it
gets
in
the
extra
space
at
least
eight
months
of
the
year
and
possibly
all
twelve.
mr.
mark
fogelman
well,
there
is--
mr.
mark
fogelman
--four
times
a
year
turn
has
priority,
that
is
correct.
however,--
mr.
mark
fogelman
--well,
in
a
sense.
i
don't
see
how
the
company--
mr.
mark
fogelman
--we
are
concerned
with
a
supposed
violation
of
the
company's
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
mark
fogelman
your
honor,
i
certainly
don't
think
that
the
corporation
has
a
right
to
refrain
from
speaking
which
is
implicated
in
this
case.
i
would
think
that
you
could
possibly
postulate
a
situation
in
which
some
area
of
corporate
autonomy
would
be
so
threatened
by
a
state
compulsion
to
speak
that
there
would
be
a
violation
of
the
principle.
mr.
mark
fogelman
of
the
right
to
refrain
from
speaking
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
mark
fogelman
on
the
other
hand,
i
don't
think--
mr.
mark
fogelman
--well,
that
would
raise
other
first
amendment
questions.
mr.
mark
fogelman
the
compulsion
of
the
john
birch
society
to
speak
would--
mr.
mark
fogelman
--it
is
a
corporation.
and,
i
guess
my
answer
would
have
to
be
that
you
can
postulate
situations
in
which
a
corporation
which
concededly
has
some
degree
of
private
autonomy
would
have
that
autonomy
violated
by
a
compulsion
to
carry.
mr.
mark
fogelman
you
could
probably
postulate
a
set
of
facts
involving
the
naacp.
mr.
mark
fogelman
i
think
what
i
meant,
your
honor,
is
that
in
this
case
there
is
no
violation
of
any
right
to--
mr.
mark
fogelman
--that
is
quite
a
difficult
hypothetical.
it
certainly
is
not
this
case.
mr.
mark
fogelman
i
am
not
sure,
your
honor,
but
it
is
a
heavily
regulated
medium
of
communication,
that
is
the
airwaves.
mr.
mark
fogelman
that
is
true.
on
the
other
hand--
mr.
mark
fogelman
--that
is
heavy
regulation.
of
course,
the
state
here
has
granted
a
monopoly
to
a
public
utility
and
it
is
only
at
the
pleasure
of
the
state
that
the
utility
has
that
monopoly
and
it
is
to
protect
the
public
that
the
state
regulates
the
public
utility
in
the
public
interest.
mr.
mark
fogelman
well,
the
tornillo
case,
in
our
view,
does
not
turn
on
the
fact
that
the
miami
herald
was
a
corporation.
mr.
mark
fogelman
well,
no,
that
is
not
what
we
are
saying.
in
some
sense,
a
pamphlet,
a
document
like
progress,
would
be
equivalent
to
a
newspaper.
pg&e's
position
is
that
the
billing
envelope,
the
medium
of
delivery
of
its
newspaper,
is
somehow
subject
to
inviolable
editorial
discretion
and
that
is
not
the
case.
mr.
mark
fogelman
i
think
it
might
well
have
come
out
differently,
particularly
if
the
supplement
were
clearly
identified
as
being
the
views
of
the
speaker,
and,
furthermore,
if
there
were
no
cost
to
the
newspaper.
one
of
the
critical
features
of
tornillo
on
which
that
case
turned
was
the
fact
that
there
was
a
penalty
on
the
affirmative
speech
of
the
newspaper.
because
the
newspaper
spoke
about
certain
subjects,
the
right-of-reply
statute
was
triggered
and
space
had
to
be
given.
that
is
not
involved
here
because
turn
gets
access
to
the
billing
envelope
under
this
program
no
matter
what
pg&e
says.
so,
there
is
no
chilling
effect
which
would
tend
to
cause
the
newspaper
not
to
address
a
specific
point
of
view.
mr.
mark
fogelman
yes,
your
honor.
that
would
be
comparable
probably
to
the
disclosure
requirements
that
the
court--
mr.
mark
fogelman
--it
is
content
regulation,
but
it
is
designed
to
protect
pg&e's
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
mark
fogelman
actually,
your
honor--
mr.
mark
fogelman
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
fogelman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
fogelman
the
statement
was
that
in
a
broad
sense
you
might
consider
this
regulation
to
be
content-neutral
because--
mr.
mark
fogelman
--no,
it
did
not
use
that
word.
mr.
mark
fogelman
that
is
my
word.
mr.
mark
fogelman
the
purpose
of...
i
believe
turn's
bylaws
state
that
its
purpose
is
to
provide
representation
to
the
interests
of
residential
rate
payers
of
public
utility
commission
proceedings.
mr.
mark
fogelman
to
oppose
rate
increases.
mr.
mark
fogelman
your
honor,
any
message
is
not
a
neutral
message.
any
message
that
takes
a
position--
mr.
mark
fogelman
--right.
it
is
an
advocacy
message.
mr.
mark
fogelman
but,
the
point
is
that
in
letting
a
participant
in
commission
proceedings
into
the
billing
envelope
to
solicit
funds
to
improve
its
participation,
the
commission
is
letting
that
entity,
whoever
it
may
be,
as
long
as
it
satisfies
certain
criteria,
speak
and
advocate
its
own
position
as
best
it
can
in
order
to
try
and
raise
money.
mr.
mark
fogelman
no,
i
don't
think
it
is
precise
content-neutrality
in
the
sense
that
you
are
using
the
term
would
be
required
to
sustain
this
regulation.
mr.
mark
fogelman
well,
to
the
extent...
would
it
be
neutral?
mr.
mark
fogelman
no,
it
is
not
a
neutral
message.
it
is
an
advocacy
position,
but
permitting--
mr.
mark
fogelman
--i
would
believe
the
commission
would
have
the
power,
if
it
faced
the
question,
to
permit
caus
into
the
billing
envelope
because
the
commission
is
doing
this
to
provide
the
consumers
with
a
diversity
of
viewpoints,
not
merely
only
the
views
of
pg&e.
it
is
also
doing
it
to
increase
the
ability
of
different
viewpoints
to
participate
in
commission
proceedings.
mr.
mark
fogelman
it
is
contrary
to
miami
herald
for
several
reasons.
first--
mr.
mark
fogelman
--well,
i
think...
first
of
all,
that
case
is
not,
of
course,
involved
here.
but--
mr.
mark
fogelman
--i
think
it
would
not
be...
the
reason
why
miami
herald
came
out
the
way
it
did
is
basically
two
reasons.
the
first
was
that
there
was
a
penalty
on
what
the
newspaper
said
and
that
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
the
second
reason
is
that
there
was
an
intrusion
on
editorial
discretion.
but,
i
don't
think
the
cases
of
this
court
hold
that
you
can
never,
never
compel
a
newspaper
to
carry
the
speech
of
third
parties.
in
fact,
there
is
a
lorain
journal
case--
mr.
mark
fogelman
--yes,
you
did.
but,
you
also,
in
the
cbs
verus
fcc
case,
permitted
candidates
for
public
office
to
have
a
limited
right
of
access
to
get
their--
mr.
mark
fogelman
--right,
right.
and,
in
a
sense,
what
the
commission
has
done
here...
the
previous
discussion
of
red
lion
is
to
do
something
similar
to
a
fairness
doctrine
to
provide
fair
access.
mr.
mark
fogelman
you
are
absolutely
right,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
fogelman
the
principles
are
the
same.
mr.
mark
fogelman
well,
i
suppose
any
position
you
take
is
likely
to
have
some
repercussions.
mr.
mark
fogelman
i
think--
mr.
mark
fogelman
--i
think
the
commission,
your
honor,
is
concerned
with
this
program.
there
are
many
hypotheticals
that
can
be
raised.
but,
the
point
is
the
commission
has
taken
a
very
limited
step
here
and
basically
pg&e--
mr.
mark
fogelman
--it
has
taken
a
step
to
try--
mr.
mark
fogelman
--it
is
taking
this
step
to
try
to
improve
consumer
participation
in
its
own
proceedings
so
it
can
get
a
fuller
record
and
make
wiser
decisions
which
is--
mr.
mark
fogelman
--that
is
right.
mr.
mark
fogelman
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
the
commission
only
recently
discovered
the
existence
of
the
extra
space,
this
income-generating
asset.
and,
i
think
at
that
point
it
had
a
problem.
what
do
you
do
with
it
that
utilizes
it
in
the
public
interest?
mr.
mark
fogelman
i
think
it
would
be
quite
similar,
yes.
mr.
mark
fogelman
well,
the
commission
has
an
obligation
to
see
that
the
utility
operates
in
an
efficient
manner
and
to
the
extent
that
unused
offices
are
not
being
used,
the
commission
can
make
pg&e
rent
them
out
presumably.
but,
that
is
not
this
case.
if
i
may
address
some
critical
points
here,
i
think
there
are
five
critical
aspects
of
this
decision
that
preclude
the
notion
that
there
is
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
first,
there
is
no
limitation
on
the
continuing
availability
of
progress
in
the
envelope.
pg&e
can
still
say
whatever
it
wants,
as
much
as
it
wants,
in
the
billing
envelope.
it
only
is
possibly
losing
a
subsidy
of
its
speech
to
which
it
is
not
constitutionally
entitled.
second,
each
speaker
is
to
determine
its
own
content
and
turn's
solicitation
messages
will
not
be
looked
at
insofar
as
they
are
consistent
with
the
program.
third,
turn's
is
required
to
identify
itself
as
the
source
of
the
message
and
to
indicate
that
neither
pg&e
nor
the
commission
have
reviewed
the
message.
this
effectively
means
that
there
will
be
no
confusion
and
this
court
can
be
sure
that
if
there
is
confusion
the
commission
will
immediately
take
steps
to
rectify
that.
mr.
mark
fogelman
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
mark
fogelman
you
are
right.
the
disclosure--
mr.
mark
fogelman
--that
is
right.
we
are
making
turn
carry
that
speech.
fourth,
there
is
no
cost
to
pg&e
for
the
inclusion
of
turn's
message,
not
one
cent.
so,
the
utility
is
really
not
being
disabled
in
any
sense
or
being
required
to
pay
any
penalty.
mr.
mark
fogelman
it
will
have
to
pay
for
it,
but
it
is
still
in
the
same
billing
envelope.
the
only
thing
is
it
may
be
moved
from
the
subsidized
space
to
the
unsubsidized
space.
mr.
mark
fogelman
and,
finally,
and
this
really
ties
to
the
program,
the
grant
of
access
to
the
ultimate
purpose,
the
money
which
turn
receives
from
its
solicitation
message
must
be
used
for
participation
in
commission
proceedings
involving
pg&e.
basically,
i
think
an
expansive
reading
of
the
three
cases,
the
barnett,
wooley,
and
tornillo
cases
are
being
asserted
before
this
court.
the
court
is
being
asked
to
expand
negative
speech
rights
to
a
set
of
facts
that
they
have
never
reached
in
the
past.
and,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
the
commission's
decision
is
reasonable
regulation.
it
has
been
done
in
other
states.
california
is
not
alone
in
this.
it
is
an
experimental
program,
but
i
submit
to
the
court
that
there
is
no
infringement
of
any
first
amendment
rights
here.
and,
if
there
is
an
infringement,
it
is
so
minimal,
the
intrusion
is
so
minimal
and
the
state
interests
are
sufficiently
significant
to
warrant
that
intrusion.
mr.
mark
fogelman
no,
your
honor,
they
have
not.
mr.
mark
fogelman
yes,
they
have.
