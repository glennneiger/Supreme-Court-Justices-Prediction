mr.
harris,
a
moment
ago
you
referred
to
the
harper
and
row
opinion
and
the
suggestion
that
the
right
to
speak
and
the
right
not
to
speak
are
somewhat
similar.
do
you
think
the
right
not
to
be
a
courier
is
equivalent
to
the
right
not
to
speak?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
clearly
not
the
same,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
any
consumer
object
to
having
the
consumer
space
in
the
envelope
used
in
this
manner?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
kind
of
enlighten
me
a
little
more
about
the
nature
of
the
damage
to
the
corporation.
it
is
not
pecuniary
injury,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
kind
of
an
insult.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
what
is
it?
does
it
adversely
affect
the
reputation
or
it
is
misleading
or
how
does
it
hurt
the
corporation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
part
of
your
image
that
you
don't
like
people
to
oppose
rate
increases?
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
not
sure
i
understand.
you
say
the
commission
has
ordered
the
utility
to
pay
turn
$160,000
or
give
it
from
public
funds?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
and,
is
it
in
the
nature
of
like
paying
for
their
attorneys'
fees
for
participating
in
the
procedure?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
fogelman,
a
little
while
ago
you
said
there
was
absolutely
no
content
regulation
here
if
i
understood
you
correctly.
is
it
not
true
that
there
is
a
requirement
that
there
be
a
disclaimer
enclosed
and
isn't
that
part
of
the
content--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
is
content
regulation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
am
not
going
beyond
that.
it
is
that
much.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
suggest
that
a
tornado
is
different
because
there
was
a
cost
to
a
newspaper.
it
would
chill
its
own
speech
if
it
had
to
print
replies.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
perfectly
clear
that
if
the
utility
here
had
never
initiated
a
program
of
using
this
space
for
its
own
propaganda,
that
this
order
would
have
ever
come
about?
justice
john
paul
stevens
putting
my
question
just
in
a
little
different
form,
do
you
think
the
case
would
be
precisely
the
same
in
terms
of
its
constitutional
issues
if
the
utility
had
never
made
use
of
the
space
for
a
similar
purpose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
that
extent,
turn
is
not
free
just
to
say
what
it
wants
to
say.
so,
two
and
three
are
somewhat
contradictory.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
say
to
that
extent
turn
is
not
absolutely
free
to
use
the
space
exactly
as
it
chooses.
justice
john
paul
stevens
two
and
three
are
inconsistent
with
one
another.
