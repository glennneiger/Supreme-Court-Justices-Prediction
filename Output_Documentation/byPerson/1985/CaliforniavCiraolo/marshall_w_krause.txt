mr.
marshall
warren
krause
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
there
is
a
word
that
hasn't
been
mentioned
much
today,
and
that
is
the
warrant.
the
warrant
clause
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
what
we
think
is
extremely
and
most
significant
in
this
case.
there
are
very
good
reasons
for
requiring
a
warrant,
and
i
don't
need
to
repeat
them
here
because
this
court
has
repeated
them
in
katz
and
in
comera
and
in
karo,
and
we
all
know
what
they
are.
now,
there
are
exceptions
to
the
warrant
requirement,
and
they
show
that
privacy
or
security
in
our
society
is
never
100
percent
pure
or
100
percent
secured.
there
is
always
the
possibility,
no
matter
how
private
and
intimate
an
area
is,
that
smoke
will
be
discovered,
and
the
fire
department
will
come
in,
despite
your
protestations
that
this
is
fourth
amendment
sacred
ground.
there
is
always
the
possibility
that
there
will
be
an
accidental
entry,
that
the
police
acting
legitimately
make
a
mistake
as
to
the
address
and
come
into
your
home
and
your
privacy
is
invaded,
and
anything
that
is
seen
in
plain
view
during
that
invasion
is
subject
to
admission
in
a
criminal
court,
because
it
is
in
plain
view
while
the
police
are
acting
properly.
a
friend
can
breach
your
trust
and
tell
the
police
everything
that
you
said
in
confidence,
and
there
will
be
an
occasionally
air
traveler
who
can
look
down
into
your
back
yard,
no
matter
how
private
you
would
like
it
to
be
with
your
swimming
pool
and
your
other
private
activities
in
your
back
yard.
there
will
be
an
occasional
air
traveler.
why
does
that
deprive
mr.
ciraolo
of
privacy
any
more
than
these
other
exceptions
to
the
warrant
clause?
why
does
that
excuse
the
police
from
taking
the
perfectly
reasonable
step
of
taking
their
anonymous
tip
and
what
other
information
they
could
gather
by
appropriate
police
work
and
presenting
it
to
a
magistrate
and
getting
appropriate
authority
to
invade
the
privacy?
mr.
marshall
warren
krause
well,
i
don't
know
whether
it
is
up
to
us
to
say
that.
if
they
didn't
have
probable
cause
on
the
facts
that
are
in
this
record,
they
could
have
investigated
more.
they
could
have
determined
if
ciraolo
was
perhaps
named
in
another
police
report
with
regard
to
marijuana
cultivation.
they
could
have
done
innumerable
things.
instead,
the
police
decided
that
they
were
going
to
be
the
magistrate
and
they
were
going
to
authorize
a
search
of
mr.
ciraolo's
curtilage,
his
back
yard.
i
think
that
kind
of
a
focused
aerial
invasion
of
this
protected
area
is
much
different
than
a
casual
overflight
on
which
the
state
of
california
relies
in
this
case.
mr.
marshall
warren
krause
there
certainly
is.
i
have
read
about
100
lower
federal
courts
on
curtilage,
and
there
are
all
sorts
of
different
opinions
as
to
what
it
is,
but
not
one
case
ever
denies
the
idea
that
a
back
yard
right
next
to
someone's
home
is
curtilage.
mr.
marshall
warren
krause
i
think
it
depends
upon
what
really
is
the
intimate
area
connected
with
the
house,
and
i
wouldn't
mind
accepting
mr.
sullivan's
definition
that
he
gave
in
his
portion
of
the
argument.
something
intimately
connected
with
the
house.
people
go
in
and
out
of
their
house.
they
use
the
outdoor
area
in
the
same
way
that
they
use
the
indoor
area
when
they
are
fortunate
enough
to
have
one,
and
they
have
their
right
to
privacy
in
the
same
way.
i
would
not
distinguish.
i
would
agree
with
justice
powell
in
the
oliver
case
that
there
really
is
no
distinction
between
the
privacies
of
the
home
and
the
privacies
of
the
back
yard,
the
intimate
area
of
the
home,
unless
you
give
up
that
distinction.
if
you
don't
build
a
fence
and
you
let
your
neighbors
look
in,
then
you
have
waived
the
right
of
privacy.
but
in
ciraolo's
case,
he
did
not
do
that.
he
built
his
fence,
and
i
think
there
is
no
question
that
it
is
within
the
curtilage.
mr.
marshall
warren
krause
i
think
that
you
are
pressing
me
to
give
an
answer
when
i
can't
give
it.
there
is
a
limited
to
what
the
curtilage
is.
what
that
limit
is,
i
don't
know.
i
would
say
that
if
you
look
at
blackstone,
you
look
at
the
common
law
aspect,
where
this
whole
idea
of
curtilage
developed,
and
it
had
another
name
in
the
common
law,
by
the
way.
it
is
called
the
homestall,
which
is
something
i
discovered.
but
anyway,
that
means
that
it
is
connected
in
some
way
with
the
living
areas
of
the
home,
and
if
it
is
totally
devoted
to
agricultural
pursuits,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
quite
the
same.
i
would
say
that
if
there
is
a
barn,
if
there
is
a
house
used
for
purposes
of
the
main
house,
you
could
have
that
as
the
curtilage,
but
it
is
impossible
to
give
an
exact
definition.
i
want
to
get
back
to
the
focused
aerial
surveillance
here,
because
i
think
that
focus
is
extremely
important.
this
was
not
a
casual
overflight,
justices.
this
was
an
intense
look
at
someone's
particular
back
yard,
someone
as
to
whom
evidence
of
criminal
activity
was
already
present
in
the
minds
of
the
police.
this
was
a
situation
where
a
warrant
was
certainly
possible
to
obtain.
i
don't
know
whether
one
would
have
been
obtained
or
not.
it
depends
on
the
magistrate.
mr.
marshall
warren
krause
yes,
i
think
our
position
would
be
a
little
different
because
that
kind
of
a
situation
raises
the
same
issue
that
justice
white
dealt
with
in
the
camera
case,
that
it
is
impossible
to
be
specific
as
to
probable
cause
as
required
by
the
fourth
amendment,
so
i
have
suggested
that
under
those
circumstances
where
there
is
routine
aerial
surveillance
of
back
yards
on
an
intense
basis
that
is
going
to
take
place,
that
the
administrative
warrant
solution
would
seem
to
be
ideal,
and
could
be
adopted
on
the
same
basis
that
this
court
adopted
such
a
solution
in
the
camera
case.
one
more
thing
about
the
focused
nature
of
this
search.
the
police
knew
that
it
was
mr.
ciraolo's
back
yard.
it
wasn't,
as
you
are
landing
in
national
airport
you
might
see
someone's
back
yard,
you
don't
know
who
that
person
is,
you
don't
know
anything
about
that
person.
they
knew
it
was
mr.
ciraolo's
back
yard.
mr.
marshall
warren
krause
i
agree,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
marshall
warren
krause
because
the
focus
was
not
on
what
they
could
see
from
the
ground.
the
focus
was
on
what
they
could
see
under
very
special
circumstances,
not
as
an
air
traveler--
mr.
marshall
warren
krause
--because
the
focus
intensifies
the
attention
given
to
a
particular
back
yard.
a
routine
surveillance
from
the
air
may
or
may
not
have
uncovered
mr.
ciraolo's
agricultural
endeavors.
we
don't
know.
there
is
no
evidence
along
that
score.
the
only
thing
that
we
do
know
is
that
it
required
an
expert
to
be
picked
up
by
the
police
who
has
been
trained
in
marijuana
surveillance
from
the
air,
told
that
marijuana
is
suspected
in
mr.
ciraolo's
back
yard,
specifically
directed
to
that
place.
that
is
why
the
focus
is
much
more
intense
than
you
would
ever
get.
now,
in
your
example,
of
course,
the
police
can
bring
all
the
experts
they
want
to
look
at
the
outside
of
this
home,
but
when
you
are
talking
about
curtilage,
this
court
has
said
that
is
protected
area.
mr.
marshall
warren
krause
protected
in
the
same
way
that
the
home
is
protected
from
an
unwarranted
entry.
mr.
marshall
warren
krause
the
oliver
case
said,
joined
the
home
and
the
curtilage
in
opposition
to
the
open
field,
and
i
am
sure
that
the
majority
wrote
that
opinion
to
answer
the
attacks
of
the
dissent,
who
were
complaining
about
the
oliver
case
narrowing
privacy,
and
they
said,
no,
we
don't
narrow
privacy
in
the
areas
where
it
really
counts,
in
the
curtilage
and
in
the
home.
now,
i
read
that
case
to
say
that
the
curtilage
does
have
the
same
protection
as
the
home.
if
it
doesn't,
then
i
have
something
to
learn,
but
i
think
if
it
doesn't,
it
should
have,
and
if
it
doesn't
completely
have
the
same
protection,
it
should
have
nearly
the
same
protection,
because
in
their
back
yard
is
the
place
where
we
have
the
right
to
have
our
access
to
light
and
to
air
and
to
have
the
kind
of
repose
we
need
in
our
society.
mr.
marshall
warren
krause
if
there
were
no
fence,
it
would
be--
mr.
marshall
warren
krause
--it
would
be
a
waiver.
it
would
be
the
kind
of
thing,
the
same
thing
that
justice
brennan
talked
about
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
the
lewis
case,
where
the
police
sent
an
informant
into
the
home
to
broadcast
outside
what
was
going
on
in
the
home.
justice
brennan
said
that
that
was
a
waiver
of
fourth
amendment
rights
in
the
home.
when
you
invite
someone
in,
you
invite
them
to
say
what
has
happened
in
the
home.
so
if
you
invite
the
public
to
look
into
your
back
yard
by
not
protecting
it,
you
have
waived
your
fourth
amendment
rights.
mr.
marshall
warren
krause
i
think
the
kind
of
frequency
of
air
travel
you
are
talking
about,
justice
o'connor,
and
i
will
have
to
get
back
to
the
focus,
is
not
the
same
kind
of
scrutiny
as
i
am
talking
about.
i
am
talking
about
the
police
knowing
whose
back
yard
this
is,
so
whatever
they
see,
no
matter
if
it
is
legal
or
illegal
conduct,
they
can
report,
we
saw
such
and
such
happening
in
the
ciraolo
back
yard.
that
is
open
to
anyone
who
wants
to
listen
to
them
to
talk
about,
and
they
go
in
without
warrant,
without
permission,
without
anything.
the
government,
the
state
is
arguing
here,
they
are
saying
cover
your
back
yard
or
we
will
spy
on
you
at
will.
we
will
invade
your
privacy
without
judicial
authorization.
we
have
no
obligation
to
report
to
anyone
on
what
we
found.
we
have
no
restrictions
as
to
time,
place,
or
manner.
and
by
the
way,
it
is
too
late
to
act
after
your
privacy
has
already
been
violated,
and
there
is
a
case
on
that.
it
is
called
norml
versus
mullen,
and
it
is
in
608
federal
supplement,
where
the
drug
enforcement
agency
was
using
helicopters
to
actually
chase
young
girls
down
the
street
to
actually...
they
went
so
far
as
to
have
helicopters
hovering
so
near
outhouses
as
it
blew
the
toilet
paper
out
the
window.
0
[generallaughter.]
they
were
abusing,
and
we
expect
that
such
an
abuse
should
not
happen.
they
could
be
gathering
evidence
of
crime,
and
they
could
also
be
spying
on
a
political
gathering.
they
are
attempting
to
deprive
us
of
our
privacy
in
our
back
yard
without
limit
and
without
warrant.
as
far
as
what
the
curtilage
is,
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
a
very
good
description
of
what
we
expect
in
the
curtilage
is
found
in
the
sixth
circuit
en
banc
decision
in
the
dow
chemical
case,
and
i
hope
my
predecessors
in
this
court
will
excuse
me
for
citing
that
opinion,
but
it
is
a
very
fine
discussion
of
what
is
the
curtilage,
how
far
it
extends,
and
what
it
means
in
american
jurisprudence,
and
i
think
the
sixth
circuit
was
using
that
to
distinguish
it
from
the
dow
plant,
and
perhaps
for
that
reason
they
laid
it
on
very
heavy,
but
it
is
a
very
fine
description
of
what
the
curtilage
of
the
home
is.
i
think
that
the
oliver
discussion
of
protection
of
the
curtilage
would
be
meaningless
if
an
airplane
could
fly
over
and
say
as
we
have
in
our
case.
i
think
that
mr.
ciraolo
if
he
should
learn
in
advance
that
police
were
going
to
fly
over
his
back
yard
and
look
carefully
at
what
he
was
doing
in
his
back
yard
any
time
they
wanted
under
any
conditions,
i
think
he
could
obtain
a
civil
injunction
against
that
invasion
of
privacy,
because
i
think
this
air
space--
mr.
marshall
warren
krause
--on
grounds
of
invasion
of
privacy
and--
mr.
marshall
warren
krause
--well,
i
think
he
could
have
a
bivens
injunction,
yes.
mr.
marshall
warren
krause
and
i
think
there
is,
for
this
reason.
mr.
marshall
warren
krause
i
realize
that
without
what
i
am
going
to
say
next,
but
what
i
am
going
to
say
next
is
that
the--
mr.
marshall
warren
krause
--well,
you
could
say
that.
mr.
marshall
warren
krause
i
think
that
certainly
without
the
warrant
situation
you
have
got
the
jumping
the
fence
situation,
as
mr.
sullivan
agreed,
that
he
couldn't
peak
over
the
fence
by
jumping
the
fence
or
putting
up
a
ladder.
instead,
he
thinks
that
he
can
do
the
same
thing
by
taking
up
an
airplane,
but
it
is
the
same
privacy
that
is
invaded.
mr.
marshall
warren
krause
yes,
i
would
find
an
objection.
i
would
think
that
that
was
a
situation
that
is
ideal
for
an
administrative
warrant,
and
if
they
are
going
to--
mr.
marshall
warren
krause
--i
would
say
that
it
is
prohibitive
without
an
administrative
warrant
to
specifically
look
into
people's
property
for
purposes
of
criminal
law
violation.
in
that
answer,
i
am
not
relying
on
my
focus
argument.
i
am
relying
on
my
focus
argument
in
this
case.
now,
justice
rehnquist,
what
i
wanted
to
say
is
that
i
look
at
this
aerial
view
as
a
right
of
innocent
passage
kind
of
issue
under
international
law
where
ships
can
go
through
private
waters
because
they
are
passing
through,
but
when
it
comes
to
a
different
purpose,
if
a
ship's
purpose
in
passing
through
the
territorial
waters
of
the
united
states
is
to
spy
on
the
united
states,
the
united
states
need
not
give
that
ship
the
right
of
innocent
passage,
and
i
think
the
same
is
true
with
regard
to
a
plane
whose
sole
purpose
is
to
invade
the
privacy
of
the
back
yard.
the
homeowner
need
not
give
the
police
that
right
to
invade.
that
is
why
i
say
a
civil
action
could
be
brought.
now,
i
see
no
difference
between
flying
over
and
putting
up
a
ladder.
logically,
there
is
no
difference
whatsoever.
putting
up
a
ladder
probably
allows
you
to
verify
what
is
there
much
better
and
it
doesn't
intrude
on
everybody
else's
privacy.
at
least
when
you
put
up
a
ladder,
you
only
see
mr.
ciraolo's
back
yard.
you
don't
see
the
ten
or
twelve
back
yards
that
you
have
seen
in
your
aerial
surveillance.
the
problem
is
to
the
government
i
imagine
that
it
appears
to
be
more
snoopy.
it
appears
to
be
dirty
business,
as
justice
holmes
condemned
in
the
olmstead
case,
because
you
are
snooping,
and
somehow
to
elevate
the
police
at
a
1,000-foot
level
is
different.
now,
1,000
feet
is
about
ten
times
the
width
of
this
chamber.
it
is
really
not
that
high.
it
is
less
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile.
i
see
no
difference
between
that
and
the
ladder
situation.
in
the
carroll
case
the
government
said,
of
course,
that
their
privacy
invasion
was
only
a
little
one.
it
was
only
putting
the
beeper
in
someone's
home.
but
justice
white
pointed
out
that
if
the
government
had
sent
in
the
fbi
to
check
to
see
whether
the
chemicals
were
present,
that
would,
of
course,
be
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
so
it
is
similarly
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
when
they
obtain
the
same
information
by
sending
in
a
beeper.
and
here
they
obtained
the
same
information
not
by
the
ladder
which
they
agree
is
condemned,
but
by
sending
up
the
airplane.
i
think
that
the
idea
that
mr.
ciraolo
has
waived
his
right
to
be
free
of
a
focused
aerial
surveillance
made
for
that
specific
purpose
of
gathering
criminal
evidence
is
unnecessary
for
good
police
work.
ciraolo
didn't
open
his
privacy
up.
the
police
are
trying
to
open
it
up.
they
are
trying
to
insert
a
can
opener
and
open
it
up.
they
are
trying
to
say
that
it
doesn't
matter
what
our
purpose
is
because
some
stray
airplane
might
have
flown
over.
this
is
the
hypothetical
situation
that
doesn't
decide
fourth
amendment
cases.
fourth
amendment
cases
are
decided
by
the
realities,
and
there
is
a
footnote
in
the
carroll
case,
footnote
4,
in
which
the
hypothetical
possibility
that
privacy
could
be
invaded
is
said
not
to
deprive
people
of
fourth
amendment
rights.
the
warrant
requirement
here,
i
can't
see
how
it
could
frustrate
the
police
purpose.
it
would
prevent
an
arbitrary
intrusion
into
the
privacies
of
life.
the
words
from
the
katz
case
which
justice
stewart
wrote,
"what
a
person
knowingly
exposes
to
the
public
is
exposed.
"
i
think
that
word,
"knowingly",
is
important.
mr.
ciraolo
did
not
knowingly
expose
his
back
yard.
then
justice
stewart
went
on
to
say,
"but
what
he
seeks
to
preserve
as
private
even
in
an
area
accessible
to
the
public
may
be
constitutionally
protected.
"
that
is
what
we
have
here.
there
is
an
atmosphere
of
security,
your
honors,
necessary
for
the
freedom
we
treasure,
and
it
is
threatened
in
this
case
as
it
would
be
by
parabolic
microphones
or
satellite
surveillance
in
great
detail.
this
case
is
not
just
the
foot
in
the
door.
this
is
the
whole
monster
let
loose,
if
there
is
no
control
on
the
police.
our
citizens
are
not
to
be
seen
as
ants
from
an
airplane
but
people
who
need
their
repose
and
their
privacy
to
be
the
free
people
that
they
are.
the
fourth
amendment,
we
submit,
protects
them
from
the
shroud
of
darkness
which
the
government
is
attempting
to
place
upon
them
in
this
case.
thank
you.
