paul

may
i
follow
up
on
one
of
justice
o'connor's
questions?
she
asked
you
about
a
ground
intrusion,
and
you
say
that
would
violate
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
the
police
rented
a
fire
truck
or
a
tall
crane
and
climbed
up
to
the
top
of
it
and
looked
over
the
fence?
fourth
amendment
violation
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
that
is
your
test,
what
if
the
respondent
here
had
grown
a
big
tree
or
something
that
partially
but
not
totally
concealed
the
marijuana
plant
because
he
wanted
to
avoid
this
very
risk?
would
he
then
be
entitled
to
protection?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
exposed
to
all
except
a
very
sharp-eyed
police
officer
with
a
good,
sharp
camera,
just
as
it
is
exposed
on
the
ground
unless
you
get
a
ladder.
i
am
not
sure--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
understand.
my
hypothetical
is
that.
i
am
just
wondering
if
you
are
saying
that
the
fourth
amendment
protection
would
obtain
if
he
tried
but
just
didn't
quite
succeed
in
concealing
it
from
the
air.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
your
answer
to
the
knothole?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
it
is
a
knothole
you
have
to
stand
on
a
ladder
to
see
through,
then
it
is
bad?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
sullivan,
if
i
understand
your
argument,
the
case
would
be
different
for
you
if
the
marijuana,
instead
of
being
these
very
large
plants,
were
tiny
plants,
and
at
1,000
feet
they
would
have
to
use
high-powered
equipment
that
was
very,
very
sophisticated
in
order
to
detect
the
fact
it
was
marijuana.
it
would
be
visible,
but
you
couldn't
really
know
what
it
was
without
the
camera.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would
distinguish
that
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
suppose
the
answer
to
that
is,
they
didn't
have
probable
cause.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
you
wouldn't
show
any
protection
if
there
were
no
fence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
still
be
curtilage.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that
you
would
find
no
objection
if
the
police
as
a
routine
matter
sent
up
an
officer
every
day
to
fly
at
1,000
feet
and
look
for
these
plants?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
you
would
think
of
an
administrative
warrant,
which
isn't,
of
course,
isn't
even
mentioned
in
the
warrant
clause,
but
apart
from
the
warrant,
when
you
say
that
that
would...
that
would
be
prohibitive,
if
you
say
that
is
prohibitive,
then
you
are
not
relying
on
your
focus
argument.
