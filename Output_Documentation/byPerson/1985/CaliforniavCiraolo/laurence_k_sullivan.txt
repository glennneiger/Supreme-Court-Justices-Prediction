mr.
laurence
k.
sullivan
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
state
of
california
first
appellate
district.
that
court
reversed
a
judgment
of
the
superior
court
of
the
state
of
california
for
the
county
of
santa
clara
convicting
the
respondent
in
this
case,
dante
carlo
ciraolo,
of
marijuana
cultivation,
a
felony
in
our
state.
this
case
provides
an
opportunity
for
the
court
to
consider
a
fourth
amendment
issue
relating
to
aerial
observation
which
a
very
important
tool
used
by
a
number
of
states
as
well
as
the
federal
government
to
detect
and
locate
marijuana
cultivation
throughout
this
country.
california
contends
that
warrant
is
not
required
for
police
to
see
what
is
knowingly
exposed
in
a
yard,
fenced
or
not,
to
anyone
who
cares
to
look
from
navigable
air
space.
the
facts
in
this
case,
your
honors,
are
that
the
police
received
an
anonymous
complaint
that
marijuana
could
be
seen
growing
in
a
yard
at
a
home
in
the
city
of
santa
clara.
an
officer
went
by
the
house
on
foot,
and
from
the
street
he
saw
a
rear
fence
which
had
bamboo
stakes
attached
to
the
top
of
it
elevating
the
fence
up
to
ten
feet.
the
officers
undertook
air
observation
from
an
airplane
at
an
altitude
of
not
less
than
1,000
feet
of
ground
level,
and
navigated
through
air
traffic
in
a
flight
line
with
the
san
jose,
california,
airport.
without
visual
or
optical
aids,
the
officers
observed
in
the
back
yard
at
15-by-25-foot
marijuana
garden
which
was
composed,
according
to
the
officers'
affidavit,
of
plants
that
he
described
as
"full
and
approximately
eight
to
ten
feet
tall.
"
the
officers
from
the
aircraft
took
a
photograph.
they
later
obtained
a
search
warrant,
and
they
seized
a
total
of
73
cultivated
marijuana
plants.
the
respondent
ciraolo
pled
guilty
in
the
trial
court
after
unsuccessfully
moving
to
suppress
all
the
evidence
resulting
from
the
aerial
observation,
and
as
permitted
by
california
law,
he
appealed
the
denial
of
the
motion
to
suppress
to
the
court
of
appeals.
in
reversing
that,
the
appellate
court
held
that
the
aerial
observation
was
an
unreasonable
search
under
the
fourth
amendment,
and
the
california
supreme
court
denied
a
hearing.
the
ultimate
issue
in
this
case
is,
as
in
the
companion
case,
dow,
whether
ciraolo
had
an
expectation
of
privacy
against
aerial
observation
of
his
garden
that
society
is
prepared
to
recognize
as
reasonable.
our
position
in
this
case
is
straightforward.
when
a
person's
property
is
concealed
from
public
view,
then
the
fact
of
its
possession
is
private,
but
if
property
is
in
public
view,
it
is
in
no
sense
private,
and
hence
it
is
not
a
subject
of
fourth
amendment
protection.
ciraolo's
garden,
whatever
else
one
can
say
about
it,
was
knowingly
exposed
to
the
scrutiny,
the
observation,
the
identification,
if
you
will,
of
literally
anyone
in
aircraft
above
or
around
his
property.
mr.
laurence
k.
sullivan
in
this
case,
your
honor,
it
wouldn't
matter
if
it
was
in
the
open
field.
it
wouldn't
matter
if
it
was
in
the
curtilage.
mr.
laurence
k.
sullivan
no.
mr.
laurence
k.
sullivan
my
answer,
your
honor,
is
ciraolo's
yard.
and
that
is
the
short
answer.
you
can
take
various
definitions
of
it.
the
one
that
i
believe
is
most
useful
is,
it
is
the
area
immediately
surrounding
the
home
to
which
extends
the
domestic
activities
of
the
household,
which
may
be
but
need
not
necessarily
be
enclosed
within
a
fence.
mr.
laurence
k.
sullivan
if
you
can
see,
in
my
view,
if
you
can
see
through
the
greenhouse,
sure,
you
can
take
pictures,
and
the
reason
to
me
is--
mr.
laurence
k.
sullivan
--and
if
you
can--
mr.
laurence
k.
sullivan
--and
if
you
can
persuade
them
that
is
marijuana,
you
should
be
able
to
get
a
warrant.
to
me
the
photography
case,
if
that
is
what
your
honor
is
asking,
specifying
the...
or
focusing
on
the
photography
that
the
officer
did,
to
me
it
is
indistinguishable
from
a
case
where
the
officer
was
looking
down
from
the
airplane,
saw
it,
and
had
a
stenographer
and
said,
here,
i
am
going
to
describe
to
you
under
oath
right
now
what
i
am
looking
at.
to
me
that
was
controlled
by
the
court's
decision
in
jacobson.
you
are
controlling
against
the
risk
of
misdescription.
mr.
laurence
k.
sullivan
yes.
mr.
laurence
k.
sullivan
one
of
the
attorneys--
mr.
laurence
k.
sullivan
--one
of
the
attorneys
in
the
prior
case,
your
honor,
said
that
there
is
a
california
case,
and
that
is
right,
there
is.
there
is
a
california
case,
for
what
it
is
worth.
well,
this
is
a
california
case,
too,
and
we
think
it
is
wrong.
mr.
laurence
k.
sullivan
my
view
is
that
there
are
lots
of
other
ways
of
handling
that
kind
of
problem.
the
constitution
doesn't
necessarily
constitutionalize
faa
regulations.
it
seems
to
me
there
might
well
be
remedies
through
an
injunction
action--
mr.
laurence
k.
sullivan
--i
suspect
that
if
you
are
hovering
over
20
feet
you
have
got
a
strong
case
that
it
may
well
be,
but
i
am
saying
that
if
this
cort
was
ever
presented
with
that
situation,
it
probably
would
first
look
to
the
question
of
whether
there
realistically
are
better
ways
of
adapting
or
controlling
for
that
kind
of
abuse.
i
don't
mean
to
say
in
any
way
that
cops
should
be
going
around
hovering
at
25
feet.
i
am
saying
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
respond
to
the
fact
that
there
are
remedies,
and
you
don't
necessarily
have
to
constitutionalize
something
every
time
somebody
says,
gee,
that
really
seems
offensive
to
me.
mr.
laurence
k.
sullivan
the
fourth
amendment
to
my
mind
imposes
limits
on
the
expectations
of
privacy
which
people
have
that
society
is
prepared
to
recognize.
in
this
case--
mr.
laurence
k.
sullivan
--in
my
view
that
would
turn...
my
feeling
would
be
no,
your
honor.
and
the
reason
is,
in
the
context
of
this
case,
is
the
same,
is
that
we
don't
have
people
going
around
with
infrared
devices
shooting
at
them
through
windows.
we
do
have
airplanes.
we
do
have
people
that
use
airplanes
for
no
other
reason
than
to
look
down
on
the
ground,
including
fenced
yards.
so
it
seems
to
me
there
is
a
foreseeability
aspect
there,
and
that
may
well
cross
the
line.
the
infrared
problem
may
well
do
it.
that
may
be
enough
to
violate
the
fourth
amendment.
i
am
not
saying
that
whatever
technology
exists
police
can
use.
i
am
saying
that
when
you
are
dealing
with
something
as
routine,
and
i
use
that
word
purposely,
because
as
i
understand
mr.
ciraolo's
position
before
this
court,
it
is
not
just
that
the
public
can
see
his
yard.
it
is
that
the
police
can
see
it
routinely,
that
that
is
okay,
but
what
they
can't
do
is
view
it
when
they
think
he
has
got
marijuana,
and
they
have
a
reasonable
suspicion
for
thinking
that.
mr.
laurence
k.
sullivan
yes.
mr.
laurence
k.
sullivan
yes,
i
think
the
ladder
situation,
the
hook
and
ladder
situation
is
a
foreseeability
problem,
and
i
think
i
stated
in
my
brief,
your
honor,
that
to
my
mind
the
reason
why
the
knothole
or
the
ladder
hypothetical
causes
a
problem
is
precisely
because
the
homeowner
has
taken
means
to
protect
against
the
kind
of
intrusion
you
are
talking
about.
for
example,
in
the
knothole
situation,
the
guy...
really
the
question
is
does
he
have
to
maintain
his
fence,
because
that
is
how
the
observation
was
made.
that
seems
to
me
to
be
a
quite
different
question
from,
does
he
have
to
take
any
protections
at
all,
which
is
ciraolo
saying,
no,
he
doesn't.
that
seems
to
me
to
be
a
categorically
different
question.
as
far
as
the
ladder
is
concerned,
i
go
back
to
the
proposition
that
ordinarily
when
you
have
a
situation
where
a
person
can
walk
into
a
hotel
lobby,
which
i
did
this
morning,
and
saw
sitting
there
aerial
photography
of
washington,
including
pictures
of
fenced
residential
yards,
i
think
you
are
in
a
different
situation
than
saying
that
the
police
can
go
up
and
take
a
hook
and
ladder
truck
and
stair
out
over
your
fence.
i
mean,
putting
aside,
quite
aside
any
physical
invasiveness
difference,
and
i
think
there
probably
is--
mr.
laurence
k.
sullivan
--if
it
is
exposed
to
the
air
space,
then
it
can't
be
a
very
good
tree.
mr.
laurence
k.
sullivan
well,
that
is
not
this
case,
your
honor,
because
in
this
case
the
officer
just
had
to
look
down,
and
he
wasn't
using--
mr.
laurence
k.
sullivan
--yes.
well
that
is
the
same
as
the
knothole
question,
and
to
my
mind,
to
my
mind
there
are
a
lot
of
permutations
to
that.
did
he
know
that
the
tree
only
partially
exposed
it?
it
is
like
the
knothole.
does
someone
have
to
take
extreme
measures
to
see
it?
mr.
laurence
k.
sullivan
well,
the
answer
to
the
knothole
is
that
in
many
cases
i
can
foresee
it
being
perfectly
legitimate.
if
i
am
walking
down
a
sidewalk
and
i
turn
my
head
and
i
see
a
hole
in
a
wall,
and
through
it
i
see
a
plant,
a
marijuana
plant,
i
don't
consider
that
to
be
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
before
i
am
going
to
say
it
is
a
violation,
i
am
going
to
ask
a
lot
of
questions,
like
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
hole?
some
holes
in
fences
are
for
seeing
through.
i
mean,
they
give
you
a
hole
so
that
you
can
look
through
the
fence.
i
would
want
to
know
if
the
officer
has
to
step
off
the
sidewalk.
mr.
laurence
k.
sullivan
well,
there
are...
you
have
to
draw
distinctions
that
respond
to
people's
foreseeabilities,
to
the
foreseeability
of
situations.
and
it
doesn't
bother
me
to
say
that
people
don't
expect
the
police
to
put
a
ladder
up
to
their
fence
and
to
say
at
the
same
time
that
if
a
policeman
is
walking
down
the
sidewalk
and
you
left
a
hole
like
this
in
your
fence
and
he
turns
his
head
and
sees
a
marijuana
plant,
he
can
act
on
that.
that
distinction
doesn't
bother
me
at
all,
no.
in
our
view,
ciraolo
cannot
claim
an
expectation
recognized
by
society
that
members
of
the
public
can
see
his
marijuana
garden
but
police
may
not
do
so
any
more
than
he
could
legitimately
claim
that
redhaired
people
can
see
his
marijuana
garden
from
aircraft
but
not
brownhaired
people.
what
the
fourth
amendment
in
cur
view
permits
the
police
to
do
is
to
enter
an
area
that
is
publicly
accessible,
and
there,
and
certainly
navigable
air
space
is
such
an
area,
and
there
they
may
see
what
is
normally
exposed
to
view.
mr.
laurence
k.
sullivan
yes,
and
i
suspect
the
court
would
spend
about
a
half-page
on
that,
citing
the
decision
in
karo.
in
fact,
i
think
there
was
the
mention
of
parabolic
microphones,
that
if
the
officer
marches
down
the
street
and
doesn't
have
the
parabolic
microphone
on,
it
won't
violate
the
constitution,
but
if
he
starts
aiming
it
routinely
or
randomly
at
anybody's
house
or
in
an
focused
way
at
someone's
house
specifically,
it
is
going
to
violate
it.
sure,
the
exploitation
of
technology
into
the
home
can
be
threatening
and
invokes
fourth
amendment
protections.
i
think
that
brings
up,
your
honor,
what
i
understand
to
be
ciraolo's
core
contention
in
this
case,
and
that
is
that
the
statement
in
oliver
that
the
distinction
between
open
fields
and
curtilage
implies
that
the
curtilage
warrants
the
fourth
amendment
protections
that
attach
to
the
home.
that
was
the
statement
that
i
believe
was
made
in
the
lead
opinion.
i
think
what
ciraolo
is
asking
this
court
to
do
is
to
read
that
statement
as
meaning
that
the
distinction
between
curtilage
and
the
open
field
implies
that
the
level
of
expectations
in
the
home
attached
to
the
curtilage.
that
is
not
what
the
statement
said.
it
said
protections
of
the
fourth
amendment.
the
level
of
privacy
expected
in
the
home,
i
submit
to
you,
is
different
than
the
level
of
privacy
outside
in
the
curtilage
because
by
custom,
by
habit,
when
we
want
the
highest
level
of
privacy,
we
retire
into
the
home.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
order
to
know
what
protections
attach
to
the
curtilage,
one
has
to
know
what
level
of
protection
attaches
to
the
home,
but
for
this
court
that
is
not
a
new
question.
that
was
answered
in
katz,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
katz
controls
this
case.
the
statement
was,
around
which
this
case
seems
to
revolve
like
the
moon
around
the
earth
is
what
a
person
knowingly
exposes
to
the
public
even
in
his
own
home
or
office
is
not
a
subject
of
fourth
amendment
protection.
but
what
he
seeks
to
preserve
as
private
even
in
an
area
accessible
to
the
public
may
be
protected.
now,
to
my
mind
that
doesn't
take
a
lawyer
to
figure
out
what
the
court
was
saying.
i
mean,
it
responds
to
something
that
we
all
understand
and
know.
it
responds
to
the
realities
of
life.
if
you
keep
something
out
of
public
view
in
your
home
or
your
curtilage
the
fact
that
some
individual
may
have
means
of
observing
it
does
not
mean
that
the
government
necessarily
can
do
so
without
justification.
but
if
the
public
can
see
it
by
virtue
of
where
you
placed
it,
it
doesn't
matter
if
it
was
in
your
home
or
in
your
yard,
and
it
doesn't
matter
that
you
hoped
it
would
be
secret
from
government,
because
you
disclosed
it.
there
is
no
privacy
interest
advanced
protecting
from
observation
what
was
entirely
visible
to
everyone,
including
the
officer
who
could
have
acted
as
a
private
citizen
and
observed
the
very
same
thing.
i
think
if
that
contention
is
accepted
in
this
case,
then
all
of
ciraolo's
other
arguments
as
far
as
fences
acting
as
roofs
or
being
a
badge
of
expectation,
as
far
as
the
focus
argument
that
i
can
expect
police
to
look
at
my
yard
routinely
but
i
don't
expect
them
to
look
at
it
when
they
have
reasonable
suspicion,
all
the
rest
of
those
arguments
just
seem
to
me
to
fall
by
the
wayside.
mr.
laurence
k.
sullivan
no,
your
honor,
because
if
i
was
going
to
make
that
argument,
i
would
be
saying...
i
would
be
contradicting
myself
in
saying
the
police
can
walk
into
your
back
yard.
they
can't.
and
that
is
true
whether
or
not,
in
my
view,
whether
or
not
there
is
a
fence
or
not.
they
can't
walk
into
the
curtilage.
they
can't
physically
trespass
it.
mr.
laurence
k.
sullivan
if
they
can
see
it...
i
mean,
all
i
have
to
argue,
and
what
i
am
arguing
is,
if
they
can
see
it
with
the
naked
eye
from
air
space,
sure,
they
can
take
a
camera
and
photograph
exactly
what
they
saw,
which
is
what
they
did
here.
mr.
laurence
k.
sullivan
if
you
can
see
the
marijuana
with
your
naked
eye
from
air
space,
i
don't
think
it
makes
one
whit
of
difference
or
not
the
officer
has
a
camera
with
him
or
not,
because
all
he
is
doing
is...
the
expectation
of
privacy
vis-a-vis
aerial
observation
wasn't
there
to
begin
with.
you
didn't
have
a
secret
from
anyone--
mr.
laurence
k.
sullivan
--from
the
air.
that
is
right.
you
didn't
have
a
secret
to
begin
with.
you
didn't
have
a
privacy
interest
from
aerial
observation
to
begin
with,
and
therefore
that
expectation
cannot
be
created
through
the
fact
that
the
officer
having
identified
your
marijuana
now
takes
a
picture
of
it
so
he
can
show
the
magistrate.
i
just
don't
understand
that
argument.
mr.
laurence
k.
sullivan
i
suspect
that
might
well
be
a
different
case.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
laurence
k.
sullivan
i
understand
i
was
hearing
the
previous
example
given
by
justice
powell,
i
believe,
of
looking
through
one
of
the
glass
buildings
that
has
opaque
windows
in
it,
and
using
some
sort
of
penetration
aid
to
visually
observe
that.
well,
to
my
mind,
maybe
i
am
being
overly
simplistic.
the
public
doesn't
carry
those
around
with
them.
they
can't
see
into
the
building.
so
maybe
the
government
shouldn't
be
able
to
use
that,
at
least
not
without
some
kind
of
regulation,--
if
that
is
true,
all
right,
but
that
is
not
my
case.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
if
the
public
can
be
there
and
if
the
police
can
be
there
and
see
the
thing
routinely,
which
i
guess
they
can,
because
ciraolo
says
random
patrol
is
okay,
why
in
the
world
can't
they
be
there
because
they
are
following
up
their
suspicion
that
led
them
to
that
place?
it
just
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
me.
i
think
that
there
is
no
constitutional
requirement
in
this
case
that
the
government
have
a
warrant.
i
think
that
there
is
no
requirement
that
the
constitution
places
on
police
that
they
have
some
quantum
of
suspicion
for
why
they
were
looking.
i
think
what
they
can
do
is
go
into
navigable
air
space,
and
i
think
they
can
use
their
eyes,
and
i
think
they
can
see
what
everybody
else
can
see.
now,
that
may
seem
to
be
not
the
most
earthshaking
proposition
this
court
has
ever
heard,
but
i
think
it
is
all
that
this
court
needs
to
say
in
order
to
reverse
the
court
of
appeals.
and
i
urge
it
to
do
so--
mr.
laurence
k.
sullivan
just
very
briefly,
your
honor.
i
do
agree
with
one
thing
that
mr.
krause
does
say
in
this
case,
and
that
is
that
fourth
amendment
cases
are
decided
by
reality
and
not
hypotheticals,
but
what
he
keeps
talking
about
seems
to
be
some
distinction
between
intense
looking
and
non-intense
looking,
and
routine
and
focusing,
and
for
the
life
of
me
i
don't
understand
those
arguments,
because...
i
mean
i
know
what
air
patrol
involves,
and
air
patrol
involves
focusing.
you
don't
look
at
the
whole
world
from
an
airplane.
you
look
at
something
specific,
and
you
go
from
place
to
place
looking.
that
is
what
air
patrol
is.
so,
in
terms
of
focusing,
i
just
don't
understand
what
the
practical
difference
mr.
krause
is
speaking
of.
the
only
other
thing
i
wanted
to
say
is,
the
tenor
or
the
sound
that
i
get
from
the
respondent
in
this
case
is
that
there
is
something
really
oppressive
and
egregious
and
perhaps
subjective
but
nonetheless
there,
and
i
know
the
court
doesn't
like
to
listen
to
quotes,
but
to
get
the
flavor
of
this
case,
the
fellow's
name
involved
in
this
is
officer
schutz,
detective
john
schutz,
and
he
was
the
only
witness
at
the
suppression
hearing,
and
this
is
the
officer
as
he
makes...
describing
his
intensive
scrutinizing,
his
focus.
"we
were
extremely
busy
with
plotting
our
direction.
"
"we
had
a
number
of
different
places
to
go.
"
"we
had
to
watch
for
other
aircraft.
"
"we
were
in
a
flight
line
with
the
san
jose
airport.
"
"and
all
i
recall
was
plotting
these
various
locations
on
my
map
attempting
to
get
one
point
after
another
without
tying
up
air
traffic
too
long.
"
now,
i
don't
know.
i
mean,
maybe
i'm
wrong.
but
it
doesn't
sound
like
to
me
this
guy
is
an
airborne
spy.
it
sounds
to
me
like
he
is
a
guy
who
wants
to
get
home
to
the
wife
and
kids.
mr.
laurence
k.
sullivan
your
honor,
he
couldn't
get
a
warrant.
he
didn't
have
probable
cause.
and
the
question
here
is,
do
you
ground
the
aircraft
because
they
don't
have
probable
cause?
if
you
say
that,
well,
then,
you
know,
what
we
are
really
talking
about
here
is
the
marijuana
dealers
or
growers
will
do
whatever
you
say.
if
you
say
a
fence
acts
as
a
roof
under
the
constitution,
they
will
all
build
a
fence.
i
mean,
that
is
really
what
it
comes
down
to.
they
will
do
exactly
what
you
tell
them
to
do.
they
will
adapt
their
ways
to
whatever
is
appropriate
to
get
protection.
mr.
laurence
k.
sullivan
i
mean
that
they--
mr.
laurence
k.
sullivan
--i
mean--
mr.
laurence
k.
sullivan
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
laurence
k.
sullivan
i
simply
mean
that
they
read
opinions
carefully,
and
i
didn't
mean
it
in
any
other
way
but
that.
thank
you.
