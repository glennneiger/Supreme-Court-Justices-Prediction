what
would
you
say
about
a
large
greenhouse?
sometimes
they
have
greenhouses
these
days
that
cover
three
or
four
acres,
and
even
california's
tall
marijuana,
a
ten,
twelve-foot
greenhouse.
would
it
be
the
same.
they
could
take
pictures
through
the
glass
of
the
greenhouse,
aerial
pictures?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
sullivan,
i
assume
you
agree
that
a
police
officer
would
not
be
authorized
to
make
a
ground
entry
examination
of
the
curtilage
in
this
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
what
about
a
low
level
hovering
helicopter
examination?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
there
is
a
distinction
there?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
your
view
of--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--is
there
a
fourth
amendment
violation
by
virtue
of
the
low
level
hovering
helicopter
in
your
view
or
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
perhaps
you
don't,
but
do
you
recognize
that
there
are
fourth
amendment
limits
to
the
type
of
technology
and
enhancement
of
ordinary
powers
of
observation
that
police
can
use?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
we
prepared
to
recognize
an
interest
against
the
use
of
infrared
photography
or
some
other
visual
enhancement
devices
of
that
kind?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
am
not
sure
that
i
understand
your
focus
argument.
suppose
we
are
just
concerned
with
a
ground
search,
and
police
have
reasonable
suspicion
of
drug
dealing
out
of
a
certain
house.
they
are
not
required
to
go
a
warrant.
they
can
instead
choose
to
make
a
focused
examination
of
the
exterior
of
the
premises
and
make
a
stakeout
and
take
all
the
time
they
want
to
determine
the
situation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
why
isn't
the
same
thing
true
of
the
examination
from
the
air?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
but
they
could
have
seen
it
in
a
routine
patrol.
why
can't
they
focus
on
it
from
the
air?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
protected
from
what?
from
an
entry
on
the
ground.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
don't
think
the
court
has
said
that.
i
think
that
is
the
question,
and
i
don't
think
the
court
has
said
that.
certainly
oliver
didn't
say
that.
all
it
said
was,
the
curtilage
is
different
from
the
open
field.
it
didn't
say
it
is
entitled
to
the
same
protection
as
the
house.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
in
this
day
and
age,
with
the
frequency
of
air
travel,
it
may
well
be
that
if
you
don't
put
a
patio
cover
over
your
back
yard
you
waive
any
right
for
an
aerial
look.
