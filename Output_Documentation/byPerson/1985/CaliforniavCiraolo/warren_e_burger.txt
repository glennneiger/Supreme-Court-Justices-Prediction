we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
california
against
ciraolo.
mr.
sullivan,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
if
you
can
persuade
someone
that
that
is
marijuana--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--that
is,
if
you
are
going
to
get
a
warrant
before
you
actually
seize
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
would
like
to
test
out
something
in
justice
o'connor's
question.
suppose
there
was
invented,
and
maybe
there
has
already
been
invented
a
gadget
that
can
aim
and
go
through
the
walls
of
a
house
and
listen
to
the
conversations
inside.
if
the
police
did
that,
going
through
the
walls
of
a
private
home,
and
recorded
a
conversation
about
some
criminal
activity,
would
that
be
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
without
a
warrant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
krause?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
limit
in
your
view
to
what
may
constitute
curtilage
around
a
residence
as
to
space?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
big
can
it
be?
no
limit?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose,
given
the
enormous
profits
in
the
drug
business,
that
someone
takes
two
acres
or
four
acres
and
builds
a
wall
entirely
around
it
as
tall
as
the
ceiling
of
this
room.
is
that
all
private?
is
that
curtilage?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
sullivan?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
i
have
an
announcement.
the
court
will
adjourn
and
be
in
recess
tomorrow,
wednesday,
in
honor
and
in
memory
of
the
late
justice
stewart,
and
the
cases
set
for
argument
tomorrow
will
be
heard
on
thursday
at
the
usual
time.
