mr.
sullivan,
in
oliver
we
had
an
open
field
a
substantial
distance
from
any
residence.
and
you
have
just
been
talking
about
the
privacy
protected
within
a
home.
the
curtilage,
as
suggested
in
oliver,
often
is
considered
to
be
a
part
of
the
residential
area
occupied
by
a
family.
your
argument
is,
however,
as
i
understand
it,
that
that
curtilage
is
more
like
an
open
field
than
it
is
like
a
home.
is
that
what
your
argument
is?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
they
may
photograph
it.

and
that
would
be
true,
for
example,
if
you
had
a
type
residence
with
a
patio
in
the
back
surrounded
by
a
brick
wall
and,
say,
a
swimming
pool
in
one
part
of
it,
and
marijuana
being
planted
right
beside
the
swimming
pool.
same
rule,
i
suppose,
would
be
your
argument.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
from
the
air.
