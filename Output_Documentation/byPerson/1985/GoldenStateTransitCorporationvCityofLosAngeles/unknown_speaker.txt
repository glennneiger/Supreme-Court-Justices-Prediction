unknown
speaker
mr.
fasman,
may
i
inquire
about
the
present
status
of
your
client.
has
the
franchise
period
now
totally
expired?
unknown
speaker
and
so,
is
this
case
moot
as
a
result?
unknown
speaker
was
bankruptcy
filed?
unknown
speaker
has
that
proceeded?
what's
the
status
of
the
bankruptcy?
unknown
speaker
so,
what
saves
this
case
from
mootness,
then?
unknown
speaker
is
it
a
chapter
11?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me
for
interrupting
you
again,
but
i'm
reminded
in
looking
at
my
notes
that
i
believe
the
only
thing
that
your
client
sought
below
was
injunctive
relief
on
the
pre-emption
claim
and
not
damages
and
not
due
process
or
any
other
claim.
so,
what
relief
of
an
injunctive
nature
would
possibly
help
now,
with
an
expired
franchise?
unknown
speaker
but
that
wasn't
before
the
court?
unknown
speaker
that
was
not
claimed
or
sought?
unknown
speaker
why
not
solve
that
by
pointing
out
the
damage
claim?
unknown
speaker
pointing
out
the
damage
claim
to
me,
so
i
can
see
it.
is
it
in
the
appendix?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
just
ask
damages
for
violation
of
federal
statute?
unknown
speaker
you
point
out,
$10,000.
unknown
speaker
yes,
$10
million.
profitable
company.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if,
mr.
fasman,
the
city
of
los
angeles
proposed
to
let
a
large
contract
and
in
reviewing
the
four
final
bidders
said
of
three
of
them,
you
three
have
a
history
of
strikes
and
labor
disputes.
the
fourth
doesn't.
otherwise
your
bids
are
all
equal
so
we're
going
to
take
the
person
who
doesn't
have
a
history
of
strikes
and
labor
disputes.
unknown
speaker
it
would
be
different
if
the
city
said,
we're
going
to
only
franchise
one
taxi
company
and
you
had
four
competitors
of
the
kind
i've
just
described,
it
could
then
say,
well,
take
the
one
without
the
history
of
union
troubles?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
why
doesn't
your
reasoning
carry
over
to
the
letting
of
a
contract?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
i
would
think
again,
logically
your
argument
carries
over
the
contract
situation.
maybe
the
city
of
los
angeles
is
required
by
federal
labor
policy
to
just
tolerate
strikes
on
the
part
of
people
it
contracts
with.
unknown
speaker
by
my
hypothesis,
the
city
of
los
angeles
is
turning
down
three
out
of
four
contracts
in
advance
because
they
have
a
history
of
strikes
and
labor
trouble.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
does
los
angeles
have
a
limited
number
of
taxicabs,
or
do
they
just
give
a
franchise
to
any
company
that
comes
along
that
shows
it's
able
to
operate
taxicabs?
unknown
speaker
did
the
city
say,
well,
we've
got
enough
cabs
now,
no
one
else
need
to
apply?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
the
city
is
certainly
entitled
to
make
sure
that
there
are
enough
cabs
in
town
to
do
the
job.
unknown
speaker
and
if
you're
the
largest
taxicab
company
in
town
and
you're
on
strike,
and
they
have
to
replace
you
if
there
are
going
to
be
enough
cabs,
and
if
they
have
a
limit
on
the
number
of
cabs,
it
certainly
changes
the
flavor
of
the
case.
unknown
speaker
there
is
at
least
one
city
that
the
cabs
are
limited.
unknown
speaker
there
is
at
least
one
city,
new
york,
where
there's
a
limit.
unknown
speaker
you
have
to
have
a
medallion.
after
about
50
years
they
decide
to--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
fasman,
incidentally,
was
any
unfair
labor
practice
charge
filed?
unknown
speaker
mr.
fasman,
does
your
argument
really
come
down
to
this,
that
congress
in
effect
has
said
that
this
particular
economic
weapon
shall
not
be
regulable
either
by
the
federal
government
or
by
the
states?
unknown
speaker
is
that
what
it
comes
down
to?
unknown
speaker
machinist
involved
a
state
regulation
directed
at
regulation
of
labor
conduct.
this
is
just
a
decision
of
the
city
of
los
angeles
not
to
renew
a
franchise.
it
isn't
quite
the
same
thing.
unknown
speaker
if
you're
right
that
indirect...
direct
doesn't
mean
anything,
then
the
previous
contractor's
example
would
surely
fall
too.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
question
in
the
case
that
the
reason
the
franchise
was
denied,
was
not
renewed,
was
because
you
were
on
strike?
unknown
speaker
didn't
the
ninth
circuit
assume
that
that
was
the
case?
unknown
speaker
on
that
point,
mr.
fasman,
i
didn't
really
understand
what
the
second
ninth
circuit
opinion
did
adopt.
it
said
something
to
the
effect
that
nothing
in
the
record
indicates
the
city's
decision
was
not
concerned
with
transportation,
kind
of
a
double
negative
there.
i
didn't
know
what
they
meant,
and
i
didn't
know
whether
that
was
overturning
the
earlier
district
court
finding
that
a
city's
decision
to
decline
to
renew
the
franchise
was
based
solely
on
the
strike,
or
what.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
was
just
a
bit
ambiguous,
and
might
have
been
intended
to
suggest
that
there
were
too
many
taxicabs
and
so
their
decision
was
based
on
trying
to
improve
the
transportation
situation.
unknown
speaker
judge
norris
took
the
position
that
your
client
simply
had
not
introduced
any
evidence
to
support
its
factual
contentions
under
the
nlra.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
district
court
found
it
as
a
fact?
unknown
speaker
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
come
back
to
the
question,
what
fact
did
the
district
court
find
that
justifies
your
position,
what
fact
or
facts?
judge
norris
said
that
you
have
not
proved
the
basis
for
the
claim
that
you
made.
unknown
speaker
the
district
court
found
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
don't
need
to
read
it
to
me.
unknown
speaker
in
the
findings
of
fact
of
the
district
court,
i
didn't
see
any
specific
findings
that
support
your
position
that
there
are
inferences
that
can
be
drawn
from
the
letter
written
to
the
mayor
and
members
of
the
council,
from
certain
statements
that
were
made
at
the
council
hearing,
but
no
factual
finding.
unknown
speaker
the
case
is
on
summary
judgment,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
suppose,
mr.
haggerty,
the
city
council
said,
the
only
way
to
have
labor
peace
in
this
town
is
to
make
a
contract
with
the
teamsters
union.
assume
first
that
golden
state
had
no
union
contract
at
all.
the
city
council
said,
the
only
way
you
can
really
have
a
continuity
of
service
is
to
join
up
with
the
teamsters
union
and
if
you
don't
do
it,
you
don't
get...
we
don't
renew
your
license.
could
they
do
that?
unknown
speaker
let's
assume
that
that
is,
the
record
shows
that
that's
probably
correct.
unknown
speaker
the
city
council
can
then
require
them
to
make
a
contract
with
the
teamsters
union?
unknown
speaker
that
may
be
so.
it
depends
on
why
they
took
no
action.
do
you
challenge
the
proposition
that
the
reason
the
city
didn't
renew
was
because
of
the
strike,
because
of
the
unsettled
strike?
unknown
speaker
do
you
challenge
it
or
not?
my
question
to
you,
do
you
challenge
it?
unknown
speaker
my
question,
do
you
challenge
that
the
city...
do
you
challenge
the
fact
that
the
city
cancelled
the
franchise
because
of
the
strike?
unknown
speaker
because
the
record
doesn't
show,
you
don't
think?
unknown
speaker
was
it
true
that
the
city
never
challenged
that
that
was
the
reason,
in
the
preliminary
injunction
hearing?
unknown
speaker
how
many
people
on
the
council
of
los
angeles?
unknown
speaker
fifteen?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
district
court's
findings?
didn't
the
district
court
find
it
as
a
fact?
unknown
speaker
los
angeles
issues
quite
a
few
licenses,
isn't
that
right,
to
other
businesses?
unknown
speaker
could
they
withhold
a
business
license,
if
we
rule
with
you
here
could
they
withhold
a
business
license
from
a
place
that
has
a
strike?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
a
healthy
restaurant
industry?
unknown
speaker
then
why
should
they
grant
a
license,
ever,
to
anybody?
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
they
didn't
need
the
400
cabs
of
golden
state?
unknown
speaker
they
just
put
a
limit
on
the
number
of
cabs
each
company
could
have?
unknown
speaker
but
they
didn't
say
that
they
wouldn't
grant
any
more
licenses
to
others?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
mr.
haggerty,
the
case
comes
on
summary
judgment.
are
you
saying
to
us
that
we
can
assume
that
even
if
the
strike
had
been
settled
that
the
franchise
would
not
have
been
renewed?
unknown
speaker
on
summary
judgment,
we
can
say
the
strike
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
decision?
unknown
speaker
and
they
would
have
exercised
it
in
the
came
way
even
if
there
had
been
no
strike?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
record...
on
summary
judgment
you
take
the
facts
against
you,
as
i
understand
it.
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
surplusage
was
the
motivating
background
here?
then,
we
wouldn't
have
any
pre-emption
issue
at
all,
would
we?
if
they
said,
we've
got
enough
taxicabs
and
the
boys
aren't
making
a
good
living
and
they're
cluttering
up
the
streets
so
we're
not
going
to
give
you
a
franchise
for
your
400
cabs,
then
there
wouldn't
be
any
labor
question
at
all,
would
there,
labor
act
question?
unknown
speaker
you
are
suggesting
that
was
the
reason?
unknown
speaker
therefore
you're
saying
that
whatever
the
motive
was,
it
was
right?
unknown
speaker
that
certainly
is
asking
for
affirmance
on
a
completely
different
ground,
and
that
would
have
been
an
awfully
easy
way
for
the
city
to
dispose
of
the
whole
case,
from
the
time
of
the
preliminary
injunction
hearing
on
up
to
any
of
the
courts.
but
you
never
took
that
position
before,
did
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly
the
courts
below
didn't
find
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
see
a
difference,
mr.
haggerty,
between
saying
that
the
reason
the
city
cancelled
the
franchise
or
refused
to
renew
the
franchise
was
because
golden
state
was
in
a
labor
dispute,
that's
point
one,
and
to
say
that
the
city
cancelled
or
refused
to
renew
the
franchise
because
it
wanted
to
help
the
teamsters
in
that
labor
dispute?
unknown
speaker
let
me
just
go
back
to
this
other
point
a
moment.
isn't
it
correct
that
the
court
of
appeals,
as
the
basis
for
its
decision,
assumed
that
the
city
insisted
upon
a
renewal...
i
mean,
insisted
upon
a
resolution
of
the
labor
dispute
as
a
condition
of
renewing
the
franchise?
unknown
speaker
what
you
are
saying
is,
they
could
have
decided
the
case
in
some
other
way?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
on
summary
judgment,
and
if
there's
some
evidence
supporting
the
proposition
that
if
they
went
to
trial
they
contend
they
could
prove
that
the
only
reason
for
the
non-renewal
was
the
labor
dispute,
don't
we
have
to
assume
they
can
prove
that?
this
is
a
summary
judgment
case.
unknown
speaker
is
that
just
a
long
way
of
saying
the
question
is
whether,
not
doing
business
with
a
company
that
has
a
labor
dispute
is
a
legitimate
governmental
purpose?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
have
offered
some
such
evidence
and
it
seems
to
me
on
summary
judgment,
we
have
to
assume
that
everything
they
offer
is
true
and
everything
you
offer
is
not
true.
i
mean,
we
just
have
to
resolve
all
factual
disputes
against
you,
don't
we?
unknown
speaker
i
think
the
petitioner
can
see
that
if
the
city
council
had
said,
look,
we
are
either
going
to
renew
your
franchise
because
we
think
you've
been
doing
a
fine
job,
or
we're
not
going
to
renew
your
franchise
because
we
think
you've
been
doing
a
very
poor
job.
that
would
be
permissible
even
in
the
middle
of
a
labor
dispute.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
that
case
once
someone
gets
in
a
labor
dispute,
they're
prohibited
from
having
any
dealings,
i
take
it,
with
a
public
body,
if
what
you
say
is
petitioner's
position
is
right.
i
didn't
think
it
went
that
far.
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
fasman?
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
and
if
the
los
angeles
city
council
had
said,
we
know
that
golden
state
is
in
a
labor
dispute
but
nonetheless
we've
been
dissatisfied
with
their
performance
for
a
couple
of
years
and
we're
going
to
terminate
them
right
now,
that
would
be
okay
if
that's
their
real
motive?
