mr.
john
haggerty
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
situation
where
the
city
was
acting
in
response
to
an
application
by
the
petitioner
for
a
renewal
franchise
to
replace
its
franchise
about
to
expire.
the
court
was
asking
counsel
for
the
petitioner
about
the
city's
franchising
process.
the
city
does
have
a
limited
number
of
taxicab
franchises.
taxicab
franchises
are
awarded
initially
through
a
bidding
procedure
when
they
are
to
be
awarded.
once
a
franchise
is
awarded,
though,
the
city
charter
specifically
provides
that
the
city
council
can
in
its
discretion
grant
a
renewal
or
replacement
franchise
to
an
existing
franchisee.
mr.
john
haggerty
i
think
there
would
have
to
be
some
kind
of
substantial
evidence
to
support
the
city
council's
conclusion
that
that
was
necessary
to
have
an
effective--
mr.
john
haggerty
--i
would
say
yes,
in
that
case.
mr.
john
haggerty
i
would
say
that
if
that
is
necessary
to
effectuate
a
transportation
policy
that
the
city
council
could
arguably
make
that
a
condition
of
the
franchise.
it's
not
the
situation
we
have
here,
your
honor.
it
was
merely
happenstance
in
this
situation
that
the
refranchising
process...
proceedings
took
place
in
a
totally
unrelated
labor
dispute.
the
city
in
this
situation
was
acting
pursuant
to
its
police
powers,
and
it
had
to
make
a
decision
one
way
or
the
other.
it
had
an
application
for
renewal
franchise.
if
it
took
no
action
whatsoever
the
franchise
would
expire
by
its
own
terms,
so
that
consequently
if
they
didn't
act,
as
i
said,
there
would
be
no
franchise
renewal.
you'd
have
the
same
result
that
we
had
here.
mr.
john
haggerty
your
honor,
the
record
does
not
reflect
that
that
was
a
reason
of
the
city
council.
that
gets
into--
mr.
john
haggerty
--the
city's
position
was
that
was
irrelevant.
the
city
never
attempted
to
show--
mr.
john
haggerty
--your
honor,
i
am
saying
that
i
cannot
say
what
the
reason
for
the
city
council--
mr.
john
haggerty
--the
record
shows
statements
made
by
certain
city
council
members,
but
that
does
not
indicate
that
was
the
motive
of
the
city
council.
mr.
john
haggerty
what
happened
at
the
preliminary
injunction
hearing
was
that
the
city
council,
in
opposition,
argued
that
the
motive
of
the
city
council
was
irrelevant
and
it
was
impossible,
consequently,
for
us
to...
for
the
city
to
argue
that
the
city
council's
motive
was
something
else.
who
knows
what
the
city
council's
motive
is?
as
this
court
has
said
many
times,
just
because
you
may
have
two
or
three
legislators
make
certain
statements,
that
doesn't
reflect
that
the
legislative
body
as
a
whole
acted
for
that
particular
reason.
mr.
john
haggerty
there's
15
people.
mr.
john
haggerty
yes,
15.
mr.
john
haggerty
the
district
court
was
somewhat
ambiguous,
but
arguably
the
district
court
did
make
such
a
finding.
i
should
also
point
out
that
the
city
did,
in
opposition
to
the
motion
for
preliminary
injunction,
contrary
to
what
petitioner
has
argued
in
the
reply
brief,
contend
that
the
city
did
have
a
rational
basis
for
denying
the
franchise.
mr.
john
haggerty
well,
they
issue
business
licenses
but
they
don't
go
through--
mr.
john
haggerty
--no,
because
in
this
situation
i
think
you
have
the
city
acting
pursuant
to
a
particular
transportation
policy,
to
make
sure
that
there
was
a
healthy
taxicab
industry,
and
i--
mr.
john
haggerty
--i
don't
think
transportation
policy,
in
other
words,
to
have
an
effective
transportation
or
taxicab
system
operating
on
the
streets
of
the
city
is
the
same
as
a
restaurant
business.
when
a
person
utilizes
a
taxicab
they're
not
able
to
pick
and
choose.
they
have
to
rely
on,
as
a
practical
matter,
on
the
first
taxicab
they
hail,
the
first
taxicab
they
take
when
they
come
out
of
the
airport.
they
don't
know
what
condition
that
taxicab
is
in,
whether
it
has
adequate
insurance
or
not,
and
the
courts
have
said
that
the
regulation
of
taxicabs
is
a
very
unique
power
of
the
city
insofar
as
they
are
using
the
public
streets
for
a
public
purpose.
in
this
particular
case,
i
think
the
key
in
the
analysis
of
it
is,
it
does
not
fit
into
the
vast
majority
of
cases
that
the
supreme
court
has
decided
relating
to
labor
pre-emption.
this
is
not
a
garment
case,
insofar
as
the
city
is
not
attempting
to
regulate
or
control
activities
that
are
protected
or
arguably
protected
or
prohibited,
or
arguably
prohibited
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
and
neither
is
it
a
machinists
case.
in
this
case
the
court...
i'm
sorry,
the
city,
in
taking
its
action,
was
acting
on
a
franchise
renewal.
it
was
not
directly
regulating
contact
or
activity
meant
to
be
immune
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
so,
i
do
not
think
that
this
is
a
machinists
case.
i
think
the
proper
test
is
that
when
exercising
a
routine
governmental
power
which
has
an
incidental
or
indirect
effect
on
a
party
to
a
labor
dispute,
the
proper
test
is
that
based
on
objective
evidence,
is
the
action
taken
reasonably
connected
to
the
effectuation
of
the
legitimate
governmental
goal,
and
in
this
case
the
facts
support
that
particular
test.
i
think
it
is
the
city's
business
to
have
a
good
taxicab
system.
at
the
time
the
city
council
acted
on
this
matter,
the
petitioner
had
been
on
strike
for
40
days.
there
was
uncontested
evidence
presented
to
the
city
council
at
the
hearing
that
there
was
sufficient
taxicab
services
without
the
operation
of
petitioner's
taxicabs.
mr.
john
haggerty
well,
if
there
was
no
further
need
for
taxicabs,
they
wouldn't.
mr.
john
haggerty
that's
what
the
evidence
at
the
council
showed,
and
contrary
to
what
the
petitioner
said,
the
record
does
not
show
that
with
the
petitioner's
non-operation
that
additional
cabs
came
onto
the
streets.
in
fact,
as
petitioner
indicated,
shortly
thereafter,
i
think
petitioner
said
ten
days
after
the
grant
of
the
preliminary
injunction,
the
city
council
imposed
a
freeze
on
taxicabs.
mr.
john
haggerty
each
company
could
have,
that's
correct.
mr.
john
haggerty
it
didn't
say
that,
but
before
they
could
they
would
have
to
go
through
a
bidding
procedure.
mr.
john
haggerty
and
the
testimony
before
the
city
council,
from
the
president
of
an
independent
drivers'
association,
was
that
with
the
non-operation
of
the
petitioner's
taxicabs
the
doormen
at
the
major
hotels
stated
that
the
quality
of
the
service
had
improved,
and
that
drivers
for
the
first
time
in
two
and
a
half
years
were
able
to
make
a
decent
minimal
living.
mr.
john
haggerty
that's
what
i'm
saying,
your
honor.
mr.
john
haggerty
i
think
as
a
matter
of
law
that,
based
on
the
tests
i
have
suggested,
because
i
said
this
does
not
come,
i
believe,
within
the
machinists
case
as
counsel
has
argued,
because
here
you
have
the
city
exercising
a
legitimate
police
power,
namely
acting
on
the
request
for
the
renewal
of
a
franchise.
mr.
john
haggerty
well,
again
that's
asking
me
to
speculate.
i
don't
know,
again,
what
the--
mr.
john
haggerty
--that's
correct.
but
i
think,
based
on
the
facts
in
this
case,
there
was
sufficient
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
the
council's
action
to
not
renew
the
franchise
insofar
as
the
record
shows
that
there
were
sufficient
cabs
operating
on
the
city
streets
without
these
particular
taxicabs.
mr.
john
haggerty
if
they
had
made
a
specific
finding
that
is
correct,
but
there
was
no
specific
fining.
mr.
john
haggerty
no,
i'm
just
saying...
i'm
not
suggesting
that
was
the
reason.
i'm
saying
there's
evidence...
first
of
all,
i
should
say
that
i'm
not
arguing
what
the
motive
of
the
council
was
or
was
not.
what
i'm
arguing--
mr.
john
haggerty
--that
based
on
the
record
in
this
case,
the
evidence
before
the
city
council
indicating
there
were
sufficient
cabs
on
the
street,
that
the
council
acted
properly
in
not
renewing
the
franchise.
and
the
debate
before
the
council
shows
that
the
council
members
were
very
concerned
about
the
effect
of
their
action.
there
is
discussion
by
the
council
members,
lengthy
discussions,
about
the
desire
to
act
in
the
public
interest,
and
the
council
members
even
state
in
their
the
council
members
never
even
stated
in
their
remarks--
mr.
john
haggerty
--oh,
yes.
the
city
most
certainly
has...
i
took
the
position--
mr.
john
haggerty
--the
district
court
did
not
find
that,
but
in
the
first
court
of
appeals
decision
reversing
or
vacating
the
granting
of
the
preliminary
injunction,
the
court
pointed
out
that
the
motive
for
the
city
council
was
irrelevant.
petitioner
argued
that
the
motive
of
the
council
was
to
assist
the
teamsters,
and
it
was
the
city's
position
that
that
was
irrelevant.
who
knows
what
the
motive
was,
and
since
the
city
was
in
no
position
to
claim
that
the
council's
motive
was
something
different,
the
city
wasn't
in
a
position
to
contradict
that
and
say
the
motive
was
such
and
such
as
opposed
to
what
the
petitioner
has
urged.
mr.
john
haggerty
yes,
your
honor,
because
i
think
the
record...
based
on
what
the
council
did,
there
was
no
assistance
to
the
teamsters
because
the
drivers
were
put
out
of
work
as
well.
mr.
john
haggerty
the
court
of
appeals
made
that
statement
but
i
believe
that
was
a
gratuitous
statement.
i
do
not
believe
it
was
necessary
for
the
court
of
appeals'
decision.
the
court
of
appeals
also
said
the
city
was
pursuing--
mr.
john
haggerty
--that's
right,
that
the
city
was
pursuing
a
legitimate
transportation
policy.
mr.
john
haggerty
but
again,
in
the
test
i
suggested
to
the
court
i
think
it's
a
question
whether
or
not
there
was
substantial
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
the
conclusion
that
the
city
was
acting
to
further
a
legitimate
governmental
purpose,
namely
transportation
purpose,
because
based
on
the
evidence--
mr.
john
haggerty
--no,
that
is
not
a
long
way
of
saying
it
because
it
would
be
up
to
the
petitioner
through
objective
evidence
in
opposition
to
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
to
show
that
there
was
not
substantial
evidence
supporting
the
proposition--
mr.
john
haggerty
--all
factual
disputes,
but
i
believe
as
a
matter
of
law,
if
the
evidence
is
such
in
the
record
to
show...
and
i'm
repeating
myself,
i
realize
that
there
was
a
legitimate
transportation
purpose,
then
that
is
sufficient.
as
to
the
argument
made
by
the
petitioners
as
to
the
effect
test,
and
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
granting
of
this
franchise
was
any
different
than
the
granting
of
a
contract,
that
arguably
the
granting
of
a
major
contract
could
bring
pressure
upon
an
employer
just
as
the
granting
of
a
franchise.
since
we're
talking
about
congressional
intent
here,
the
argument
made
by
the
petitioners
as
to
the
effect
test,
and
as
to
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
granting
of
this
franchise
was
any
different
than
the
granting
of
a
contract,
that
arguably
the
granting
of
a
major
contract
could
bring
pressure
upon
an
employer
just
as
the
granting
of
a
franchise.
since
we're
talking
about
congressional
intent
here,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
distinction
made
by
the
congress
as
far
as
the
granting
of
a
franchise
and
the
granting
of
a
contract.
you
could
have
a
situation
where
the
city
was
going
to
grant
a
franchise
for
the
collection
of
garbage.
if
there
was
a
strike
and
it
was
in
evidence
that
the
collection
would
not
occur,
certainly
the
city
would
be
justified
in
not
granting
that
franchise
if
they
realized
that
the
garbage
collection
would
not
result.
the
city
was
in
a
situation
here
that
no
matter
what
it
did
the
argument
could
be
made
that
the
city
was
pre-emptive.
if
it
had
not
renewed
the
franchise
the
union...
i'm
sorry,
if
it
had
renewed
the
franchise
the
union
could
come
back
and
argue
that
by
renewing
the
franchise,
using
the
argument
of
petitioner
that
the
city
was
actually
assisting
the
employer
in
is
labor
dispute,
and
consequently
the
city
would
be
pre-empted
under
those
circumstances
as
well.
in
fact,
if
the
city
had
taken
no
action
whatsoever,
using
petitioner's
argument,
the
city
would
have
been
pre-emptive.
but
again,
i
don't
believe
that
the
pre-emption
doctrine
mandates
that
the
city
grant
the
franchise,
and
yet
the
non-granting
of
the
franchise...
or,
i'm
sorry,
not
taking
any
action
on
the
franchise
would
have
had
the
same
effect
as
the
action
that
the
council
took.
mr.
john
haggerty
i
don't
believe
that
petitioner
does
concede
that,
at
least
in
the
petition.
that
is
not
petitioner's
argument.
petitioner
is
arguing
based
on
the
machinists
test
that
an
action
that
the
city
would
take,
affecting
a
party
to
a
labor
dispute,
is
pre-emptive.
so,
in
the
hypothetical
you
gave,
justice
rehnquist,
i
believe
based
on
petitioner's
argument
that
the
city
would
be
pre-empted
in
that
situation
as
well
because
it
would
have
the
same
effect.
mr.
john
haggerty
well,
if
you
use
an
effects
test
as
petitioner
does,
i
believe
that
is
petitioner's
argument.
getting
to
the
issue
of
mootness,
i
should
point
out
that
in
the
record...
it's
not
in
the
joint
appendix
but
in
103
of
the
record,
the
issues
of
law
as
raised
by
the
petitioner
on
page
16,
they
indicate
that
there's
two
issues
of
law
and
the
first
issue
is
whether
or
not
the
defendant's
denial
of
the
plaintiff's
franchise
renewal
was
contrary
to
a
compelling
congressional
direction
to
deprive
local
governments
of
the
power
to
interfere
with
public
utilities
engaged
in
collective
bargaining
disputes,
and
therefore
in
violation
of
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
constitution.
petitioner
does
not
argue
in...
at
least
as
far
as
what
they
claim
are
the
issues
in
this
case,
that
the
violation
or
the
non-granting
of
the
tax-exempt
franchise
and
the
alleged
violation
of
the
supremacy
clause
was
also
a
violation
of
the
civil
rights
act.
so,
in
conclusion,
i
believe
it's
a
situation
that
no
matter
what
the
city
did
in
this
case,
it
would
have
had
an
incidental
effect
on
the
labor
dispute
and
the
city
was
within
its
regulatory
power
to
take
the
action
that
it
did
insofar
as
there
was
sufficient
evidence,
i
believe,
in
the
record
to
show
that
the
council
was
acting
for
an
appropriate
transportation
purpose.
