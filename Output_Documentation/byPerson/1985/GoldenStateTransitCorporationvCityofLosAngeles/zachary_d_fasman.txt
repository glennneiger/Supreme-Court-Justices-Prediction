mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
comes
to
the
court
on
certiorari
from
the
ninth
circuit.
the
court
below
held
that
the
city
of
los
angeles
had
the
right
to
insist
that
petitioner
resolve
a
peaceful
labor
dispute
with
the
teamsters
in
order
to
retain
in
business.
in
so
holding,
the
ninth
circuit
made
a
fundamental
error.
it
failed
to
appreciate
that
management
as
well
as
labor
is
free
to
resist
its
opponent's
bargaining
demands
and
rely
upon
its
economic
strength
in
a
labor
dispute.
if
the
city
had
told
our
striking
drivers
that
their
licenses
would
not
be
renewed
until
they
went...
unless
they
went
back
to
work
within
a
week,
i
am
confident
the
ninth
circuit
would
not
have
missed
the
point,
where
the
conflict
between
such
demand
and
the
right
to
strike
is
patent
and
unmistakeable.
a
host
of
this
court's
opinions
protect
those
economic
prerogatives
of
organized
labor
from
local
government
interference.
put
the
fact
that
we
were
the
object
of
the
city's
coercion
rather
than
our
drivers
should
have
made
absolutely
no
difference
in
either
analysis
or
results.
this
court's
opinions
have
always
emphasized
that
both
management
and
labor
have
the
right
to
disagree
and
to
rely
upon
their
economic
strength
in
the
course
of
a
labor
dispute.
neither
party
has
a
monopoly
on
economic
weapons,
and
neither
has
a
greater
or
lesser
right
to
disagree
at
the
collective
bargaining
table.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
the
franchise
that
we
were
seeking
at
the
time
would
have
granted
us
rights
to
operate
through
march
31st
of
1986.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
i
don't
think
so,
justice
o'connor.
we
were
put
out
of
business
in
1981
and
prevented
from
operating
at
that
time.
we're
still
out
of
business
because
we
don't
have
a
franchise.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
bankruptcy
was
filed.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
i
don't
know
exactly
the
status
of
the
bankruptcy.
the
bankruptcy
has
proceeded
to
some
extent,
but
i
honestly
don't
know
exactly
what
the
status
of
it
is
at
this
time.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
well,
i
think
the
fact
is,
first,
that
we
continue
to
suffer
the
effects
of
the
denial
of
the
franchise.
we
are
still
out
of
business.
we
are
prepared
to
go
back
into
business
if
we
can
get
a
franchise,
number
one.
number
two,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
reply
brief--
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
--it's
a
chapter
11,
yes.
number
two,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
reply
brief,
we
believe
that
we
have
a
viable
damage
claim
for
being
put
out
of
business
over
these
last
five
years,
and
that,
we
think,
saves
us
from
mootness
as
well.
it
seems
to
me,
though,
that
the
ultimate
answer
to
mootness
is
that
the
city's
argument
appears
to
be
that,
if
we
have
granted
you
a
franchise
in
1981
as
we
should
have,
you
might
not
have
lived
up
to
the
terms
of
that
franchise.
you
might
not
have
been
qualified
for
renewal
and
therefore
you
might
be
out
of
business
anyway.
i
think
that
type
of
hypothetical
argument
is
really
stretching
a
long
way
to
get
mootness
into
a
case
where
we're
ready
to
resume
our
business
at
this
point.
the
ninth
circuit
in
its
decision
seemed
not
only
confused
by
the
difference
between
management
and
labor,
but
it
also
seemed
confused
because
the
city
drove
us
out
of
business
by
refusing
to
renew
our
franchise.
a
decision
not
to
renew
a
franchise
is
no
more
sacrosanct
than
a
decision
not
to
grant
a
driver's
license,
or
to
deny
unemployment
compensation,
or
to
grant
the
damage
remedy.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
well,
first
of
all,
it
seems
to
me
that
a
federal
court
can
tell
the
city
to
issue
the
franchise
that
it
improperly
denied.
the
city
has
authority
to
issue
franchises
for
up
to
ten
years.
there
was
nothing
inherent
about
the
five
year
franchise.
they
could
have
issued
us
a
franchise
that
would
have
gone
through
1990
in
the
first
place.
secondly,
the
characterization
of
the
complaint
as
to
deny
a
damage
remedy
on
the
pre-emption
claim
is
not
one
with
which
we
agree.
we
think
that
we
do
have
a
viable
damage
remedy
under
1983
for
being
put
out
of
business.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
pardon?
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
oh,
certainly
it
was,
certainly.
it's
claimed.
we
pleaded
the
case
under
1983.
we
think
there
are
three
independent
counts
in
each
one,
supported
damage
claim,
although
as
the
city
properly
notes,
we
did
not
seek
certiorari
in
the
due
process
or
equal
protection
violations
themselves.
but
we
think
there
have
always
been
three
claims
in
the
lawsuit.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
pardon?
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
yes,
sir.
the
complaint
is.
the
complaint
is
in
the
appendix.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
exactly.
the
second
cause
is
damages
for
violation
of
civil
rights.
page
13
of
the
joint
appendix
notes
the
property
rights
that
we
are
talking
about,
and
they
include
its
ability
or
our
ability
to
freely
bargain
with
the
union,
and
its
business.
that,
i
think,
lies
at
the
heart
of
it,
that
we
lost
our
business.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
$10
million.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
in
any
event,
we
believe
that
the
case
is
not
moot
for
those
reasons.
we
were...
i
mean,
realistically
we
were
driven
out
of
business
for
refusing
to
settle
the
strike.
we're
still
out
of
business.
this
was
the
largest
taxicab
company
in
the
city
of
los
angeles.
it
was
operating
400
taxicabs.
and
i
have
a
client
who
would
go
back
into
business
today
and
who
thinks
that
he's
been
improperly
treated
and
thinks
that
the
city
should
compensate
him
for
that,
and
i
don't
think
that's
an
extraordinary
proposition
nor
do
i
see
how
a
mootness
count
arises
in
that
situation,
at
least
not
a
viable
one.
nothing
in
the...
as
i
was
saying,
the
ninth
circuit
seemed
also
confused
because
of
the
franchise
issue
in
this
case,
but
nothing
about
a
franchise.
nothing
in
the
inherent
nature
of
a
franchise
in
the
court's
opinions,
in
logic,
indicates
that
the
denial
of
a
franchise
or
the
exercise
of
local
franchising
authority
should
be
treated
any
differently
for
pre-emption
purposes.
franchising,
it
seems
to
me...
refusing
to
renew
or
extend
our
franchise
in
this
case
was
merely
the
means
by
which
the
city
imposed
its
will
upon
us
and
drove
us
out
of
business
for
failing
to
settle
the
labor
disputes
within
the
time
allotted.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
well,
justice
rehnquist,
it
seems
to
me
that
when
you're
talking
about
letting
a
contract
you're
talking
about
something
different
than
we
have
here.
remember,
this
is
a
franchise
where
all
the
city
is
doing
is
certifying
that
we're
qualified
to
do
business
with
the
general
public
of
the
city
of
los
angeles.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
no,
i
don't
think
it
could,
any
more
than
it
could
say,
we'll
take
the
one
that
is
not
organized
because
when
you
have
a
union
involved
there's
the
possibility
of
work
stoppages.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
well,
i
think
the
contractual
difference
is
this,
that
when
you
let
a
contract
it
seems
to
me
that
the
city's
remedy
power
in
a
contractual
situation
does
not
go
to
the
company's
viability.
it's
one
thing
to
say,
i
don't
have
a
right
to
do
the
city's
business,
but
i
still
have
a
right
to
exist.
i
still
have
a
right
to
sell
my
goods
to
people
down
the
street.
i
still
have
a
right
to
sell...
to
put
my
taxicabs
out.
it's
another
thing
for
the
city
to
say,
you
have
a
history
or
strikes,
or
you're
organized,
or
you
have
a
strike
right
now
and
therefore
you're
out
of
business,
you
no
longer
are
authorized
to
do
business
in
this
city.
and
it
seems
to
me,
that's
the
critical
difference.
what
they're
doing
here,
it
seems
to
me,
is
merely
defining
what
i
call
the
naked
public
interest
and
saying
that
the
public
interest
of
the
city
of
los
angeles
is
that
companies
that
do
business
with
us
cannot
have
strikes.
and
that
is
not,
that
do
business
with
us,
that
do
business
within
the
city,
that
service
our
consumers,
cannot
have
strikes.
and,
that's
a
decision
that
i
think
congress
has
foreclosed.
congress
has
said
there
shall
be
strikes
and
the
public
shall
tolerate
the
disruption
and
inconvenience
that
sometimes
flows
from
strikes.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
well,
no.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
city
of
los
angeles
has
remedies,
just
as
the
federal
government
has
remedies.
if
you
don't
perform
your
contract
they
can
sue
for
consequential
damages.
they
can
invoke
a
host
of
other
remedies.
but
they
can't
say,
you're
out
of
business.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
that's
in
the
contract
setting.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
where
they're
trying
to
accomplish
some
finite
goal,
build
a
building.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
by
a
time
certain.
i
would
have
more
trouble
with
that,
but
i
don't
think
that's
this
case.
i
honestly
don't
know
how
i
would
come
out
on
that.
but
i
think
there's
a
clear
distinction,
at
least
to
me,
between
a
situation
where
they're
just
saying,
you
can
go
out,
you're
authorized
to
operate
in
the
marketplace,
and
where
the
city
has
some
finite
goal,
building
a
building,
building
a
swimming
pool
before
the
olympics
where
timely
performance
is
an
element
of
what
they're
doing.
that's
not
what
we
have
here.
what
we
have
here
is
merely
a
company
that
was
seeking
to
continue
serving
the
consumers
of
los
angeles,
and
that
seems
to
me
a
determinative
difference
in
this
case.
the
criminal
point
for
us
about
this
case
is
that
the
city,
at
the
bebest
of
the
teamsters
union,
forced
us
to
choose
between
our
position
in
collective
bargaining
and
remaining
in
business,
and
it's
our
position
that
that
choice
cannot
be
imposed
consistently
with
the
federal
labor
laws.
our
labor
laws
are
premised
upon
a
notion
of
private
industrial
dispute
settlement,
the
process
of
free
and
voluntary
collective
bargaining,
in
which
management
and
labor
resolve
their
disputes
free
from
government
interference,
is
the
keystone
of
the
federal
scheme
to
promote
industrial
peace.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
at
the
time,
justice
white,
there
were
13
companies
that
held
franchises
for
the
city
of
los
angeles.
when
this
occurred
there
was
no
limit
upon
the
number
of
cabs
that
we
could
put
on
the
street.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
they
never
did
say
that
at
this
time.
indeed,
a
year
before
this
dispute--
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
--i
think
they
probably
are,
no
question.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
well,
it
may
change
the
flavor
of
the
case
but
i
don't
think
that
they
can,
because
we're
on
strike
say,
we've
replaced
you,
you
need
never
come
back.
it
seems
to
me
there
are
alternative
ways
to
deal
with
that.
and
in
this
case,
the
other
companies
that
were
in
business,
the
12
other
companies
and
the
two
independent
associations
who
were
operating
400
cabs
between
them,
had
complete
authority
to
increase
their
fleet
size
as
they
saw
fit.
they
could
put
people
back
on
the
street,
and
that
apparently
is
what
happened
because
the
evidence
before
the
city
council
indicated
that
there
were
no
complaints
because
of
the
strike,
that
the
other
operators
had
picked
up
the
slack,
were
running
their
cabs
two
and
three
shifts.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
pardon
me?
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
i
understand--
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
--i
understand.
i
understand.
and
the
city
did
issue
seals
in
this
case,
but
the
number
of
seals
at
the
time
of
this
dispute
was
not
limited.
i
ought
to
add
that
there
were
maximum
fleet
size
limits
in
the
cab
industry
in
los
angeles
before
this
dispute,
and
after
this
dispute
there
were
maximum
fleet
size
limits
imposed.
but
at
the
time
of
the
dispute
it
was
open
season.
in
fact,
there
was
a
maximum
fleet
size
limit
imposed
in
this
case
ten
days
after
the
preliminary
injunction
was
granted.
the
legislative
history
of
the
wagner
act,
it
seems
to
me,
completely
supports
our
position
that
neither
party
is
required
to
agree
with
demands
made
at
the
bargaining
table.
the
wagner
act
is
based
upon,
premised
upon
the
notion
of
freedom
of
contract.
the
notion
of
freedom
of
contract,
voluntary
agreement,
was
made
explicit
in
section
8-d
of
taft-hartley
which
itself
states
that
the
duty
to
bargain
does
not
compel
either
party
to
agree
to
a
proposal
or
require
the
making
of
a
concession.
this
court
held
in
machinists
that
state
or
local
attempts
to
force
the
parties
to
an
agreement
are
as
inconsistent
with
the
federal
scheme
as
are
such
attempts
by
the
board.
this
court's
opinions
also
clearly
recognize
that
management
and
labor
are
both
entitled
to
rely
upon
their
economic
strength
in
a
labor
dispute.
in
1935
congress
expressly
granted
labor
the
right
to
strike,
implicitly
granted
management
corresponding
rights
including
the
right
to
replace,
the
right
to
lock
out,
and
congress
thereby
struck
a
balance
between
the
interests
of
management,
labor,
employees
and
the
general
public.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
no,
justice
blackmun,
there
was
never
any
unfair
labor
practice
charge
filed,
although
as
we've
made
clear
the
teamsters
did
come
before
the
city
council
and
complain
that
we
were
bargaining
in
bad
faith,
but
they
never
took
that
to
the
board.
over
the
last
50
years
congress
has
gone
back
and
has
revised
the
economic
balance
that
i've
mentioned
earlier.
it
has
in
1947,
it
outlawed
secondary
boycotts.
in
1959
it
put
limits
on
recognition
of
picketing.
but,
congress
has
never
varied
from
the
fundamental
premise
that
management
and
labor
are
entitled
to
engage
in
economic
warfare
and
that
the
national
interest
requires
that
the
public
tolerate
disruption
that
arises
from
strikes
and
labor
disputes.
indeed,
each
time
congress
has
considered
the
question
it
has
reaffirmed
its
original
decision
that
there
should
be
free
collective
bargaining
and
free
resort
to
economic
weaponry
by
management
and
labor.
in
1947
congress
defeated
proposals
to
impose
a
regime
of
compulsory
arbitration
upon
local
utilities
including
local
transportation
companies.
in
1974
when
congress
amended
the
act
to
include
hospitals,
it
rejected
attempts
to
ban
strikes
in
hospitals
and
to
impose
instead
a
regime
of
compulsory
arbitration,
and
indeed
went
so
far
as
to
preclude
attempts
by
members
of
the
senate
to
exempt
their
own
state
compulsory
arbitration
laws
in
the
hospital
setting
from
the
range
of
federal
pre-emption.
at
each
and
every
juncture
over
the
last
50
years
congress
has
reaffirmed
its
original
judgment
that
there
shall
be
strikes
and
that
government
coercion
in
the
bargaining
process
is
antithetical
to
our
labor
system.
the
city's
action
here
is
ultimately
inconsistent
with
that
repeated
congressional
judgment.
an
employer
simply
is
not
free
to
disagree
with
the
union
if
it's
got
to
compromise
its
disagreement
in
order
to
avoid
legislative
extinction.
it
is
not
free
to
conduct
economic
warfare
if
it's
got
to
settle
a
labor
dispute
by
a
fate
certain
in
order
to
remain
in
business.
congress
has
determined
that
the
resolution
of
labor
disputes
is
to
be
resolved
by
the
free
play
of
economic
forces,
and
that
just
simply
did
not
happen
here.
the
ninth
circuit
created
a
pre-emption
test
to
avoid
this
result
that
is
equally
inconsistent
with
the
intent
of
congress.
the
court
below
held
that
the
city's
conduct
would
not
be
pre-emptive
unless
the
city
attempted
to
dictate
the
terms
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
or
attempted
to
directly
alter
the
substantive
outcome
of
a
labor
dispute.
now,
it's
true,
of
course,
that
attempts
to
dictate
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
to
alter
the
outcome
of
a
labor
dispute,
if
i
understand
what
that
means,
are
antithetical
to
the
labor
laws,
but
in
limiting
pre-emption
to
those
two
circumstances
the
ninth
circuit
failed
to
understand
that
congress
was
ultimately
interested
in
the
bargaining
process
itself
and
that
interest
in
the
bargaining
process,
reflected
in
this
court's
unanimous
decision
last
term
in
metropolitan
life
insurance
versus
massachusetts,
where
the
court
stresses
that
the
interest
of
congress
lay
not
with
the
substantive
terms
that
the
parties
might
negotiate
in
a
labor
agreement
but
rather
with
creating
a
fair
and
balanced
bargaining
process
by
which
the
parties
could
resolve
their
disputes.
the
states
may
have
some
latitude
in
setting--
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
--exactly.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
exactly,
exactly.
it's
a
classic
machinists
case
where
we
have
the
right,
it
seems
to
me,
to
disagree
with
the
union.
we
have
the
right
to
resist
their
strike.
those
are
key
elements
of
the
collective
bargaining
system
that
we
have
and
they're
not
regulable
by
the
nlrb
or
by
the
state
and
local
governments.
this
fits
right,
directly
in
the
middle
of
the
machinists
case.
there
is
absolutely
no--
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
--well,
it
isn't
quite
the
same
thing,
but
again
i
think
the
distinction
that
you're
drawing
between
direct
and
indirect
regulation,
while
understandable,
has
not
fazed
the
court
before.
the
courts
always
looked,
it
seems
to
me,
to
the
effect
of
the
city's
regulation.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
so.
because
the
point
that
i
was
making
was,
the
congressional
interest
is
in
the
bargaining
process
itself,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
when
you
deny
a
franchise
because
of
what
happens
in
the
bargaining
process,
you've
got
a
somewhat
different
case
than
the
contract
case
that
you're
talking
about.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
i
don't
believe
there
is.
that
is,
there
is
a
factual
dispute
that
has
been
raised.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
the
ninth
circuit...
i
don't
know
if
it's
an
assumption.
the
ninth
circuit
clearly
said
it,
and
twice,
and
there
is
ample
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
that.
it's
plainly
not
clearly
erroneous.
indeed,
the
finding
of
the
district
court,
the
initial
district
court
finding
that
this
is
what
happened,
was
affirmed
twice
by
the
ninth
circuit
and
i
think
the
attempt
to
inject
a
factual
argument
at
this
point
in
the
case
is
plainly
wrong
for
the
reasons
we've
outlined
in
the
reply
brief.
let
me
add
one
final
thought.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
well,
first
of
all,
justice
o'connor,
that
is
not
what
the
ninth
circuit
said.
what
the
ninth
circuit
said
was,
and
i
quote
from
page
7-a
of
the
petition,
nothing
in
the
record
indicates
that
the
city's
refusal
to
renew
or
extend
golden
state's
franchise
until
an
agreement
was
reached
and
operations
resumed
was
not
concerned
with
transportation,
no
difficulty
in
seeing
what
they're
saying.
they're
saying
that
the
decision
not
to
renew,
not
to
extend
until
you
settle
the
strike
might
have
been
concerned
with
transportation,
and
on
the
next--
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
--well,
that's
certainly...
i
have
to
say
that
i'm
sort
of
puzzled
by
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
myself,
but
i
will
note
that
in
footnote
one
of
that
opinion,
on
page
4-a
of
the
petition,
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
there's
an
explicit
statement
by
the
ninth
circuit
saying,
we
uphold...
essentially,
we
uphold
for
a
second
time
the
finding
of
the
district
court
in
the
injunction
proceedings,
that
one
effect
of
this
conduct
was
to
change
the
balance
of
bargaining
power
between
the
parties.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
that,
justice
rehnquist,
is
the
most
mysterious
aspect
of
the
ninth
circuit
opinion.
i
truly...
i
mean,
i
can
understand
a
lot
of
things
about
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
but,
i
mean
this
is
a
case
where
if
you
admit,
as
i
think
judge
norris
does,
that
the
reason
for
denying
the
franchise
is
the
strike,
it
seems
to
me
that
at
that
point
it
becomes
a
res
ipsa
loquitur
case.
i
don't
know
how
you
get
around
the
effect
of
that
conduct
on
the
parties.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
yes,
it
did,
on
the
preliminary
injunction,
affirmed
on
appeal,
affirmed
a
second
time
on
appeal
over
the
dissent
of
judge
norris
who
then
came
up
with
his
theory
that
we
hadn't
shown
effect.
i'm
not
entitled
to
show
you
how
i
would
show
effect,
outside
of
what
we've
shown
in
the
record
here.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
justice
powell,
what
the
district
court
found
was
that
at
the
time
it
went
to
the
preliminary
injunction
stage,
it
was
undisputed
that
our
franchise
had
been
denied
because
of
the
strike.
the
city
didn't
even
contest
it.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
yes,
twice
in
its
opinion.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
well,
it
does
say
two
different
times,
in
judge
haupt's
opinion,
and
it's
cited
in
our
brief--
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
--i
think
in
the
preliminary
injunction
hearing
there
was
in
fact
a
factual
finding
and
indeed
the
court
says
twice,
in
its
opinion
it
is
undisputed
that
the
reason
this
was
denied
was
because
of
the
strike
and
that
changed
the
balance
of
bargaining
power
in
the
labor
dispute.
that
is
what
had
the
effect
on
the
labor
dispute,
and
i
think
that's
clear
in
the
opinion.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
yes,
it
was,
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment.
mr.
chief
justice,
with
the
court's
permission
i'd
like
to
reserve
for
rebuttal.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
mr.
chief
justice,
just
two
or
three
quick
points.
justice
rehnquist,
i
certainly
do
concede,
and
we've
conceded
in
the
reply
brief
the
point
that
you
brought
up,
we
don't
contend
that
any
action
the
city
takes
that
affects
the
substantive
outcome
of
a
labor
dispute
is
forbidden.
we've
got
an
action
here
that
affects
the
labor
process,
the
bargaining
process
itself.
if
the
question
were,
are
the
teamster
drivers
at
golden
state
making
$400
instead
of
$500,
we
wouldn't
be
here.
the
point
is,
my
client
was
prevented
from
bargaining
in
good
faith
and
from
using
the
economic
weapons
that
congress
put
at
its
disposal,
and
that's
the
key
issue
from
our
point
of
view.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
sure,
no
problem.
we
don't
have
any
trouble
with
that.
and
it
relates
to
the
hypothetical
that
you
mentioned
earlier.
i
mean,
the
marketplace
continues
to
operate
whether
there's
a
labor
dispute
or
not.
in
the
action,
what
happens
in
the
marketplace
has
an
impact,
of
course,
on
the
substantive
outcome
but
it
doesn't
have
any
impact
upon
the
bargaining
process
itself.
our
point
is
simply
this.
if
one
party
to
a
labor
dispute
can
go
to
the
state
or
local
government
and
have
its
opponent
legislated
out
of
existence,
which
is
what
happened
here,
there's
no
impetus
for
compromise,
settlement.
there's
no
impetus
for
bargaining
at
all.
bargaining
doesn't
exist
in
these
situations.
congress
understood
that.
congress
closed
the
doors
to
the
city
council
chamber
for
just
this
reason
and
said
to
management
and
labor,
you
folks
have
to
look
for
solutions
to
your
problems
at
the
bargaining
table
from
each
other
and
not
from
government,
and
that
is
what
happened
here.
