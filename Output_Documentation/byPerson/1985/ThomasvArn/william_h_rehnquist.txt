justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
stanley,
if
you
are
right
that
raddatz
and
the
other
case
stand
for
the
proposition
that
the
district
court
is
an
independent
adjudicator,
the
adoption
of
your
view
would
really
allow
counsel
losing
before
the
magistrate
to
simply
go
directly
to
the
court
of
appeals
without
even
paying
any
attention
to
the
district
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
district
court
would
surely
be
even
more
focused
if
it
had
the
benefit
cf
objections
to
the
magistrate's
report
from
the
losing
party.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
judge
conti
hear
oral
argument
in
this
case
after
the
magistrate's
report?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
thing
was
never
set
down
on
the
district
court's
docket
in
the
sense
of
being
kind
cf
a
petition
to
review
the
magistrate's
order.
you
didn't
submit
anything
to
the
district
court,
and
he
held
no
bearing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
far
as
notice,
do
you
think
that
each
individual
attorney
has
to
be
advised
by
the
government
or
by
somebody,
by
the
court
of
their
right
to
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
the
district
court
to
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
you
were
saying
it
was
constitutionally--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--yes,
but
i
thought
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question
was,
if
there
weren't
that
sort
of
notice,
there
would
be
real
constitutional
implications.
i
wonder
how
you
score
that
with
the
fact
that
nobody
gets
any
notice
other
than
reading
the
statute
of
their
right
to
appeal
from
the
district
court
to
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
talking
about
kind
of
a
judge-made
rule.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
of
course
judge
conti
doesn't
seem
to
have
taken
advantage
of
the
latitude
which
you
say
congress
gave
him.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
maybe
he
enjoys
reviewing
magistrates'
decisions.
