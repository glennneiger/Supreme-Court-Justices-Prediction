justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
question
before
you
go
to
your
second
point?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
understand
the
sixth
circuit
rule
to
be
that
they
think
the
statute
compels
a
waiver,
or
that
as
a
matter
of
practice
in
the
sixth
circuit
we
will
enforce
the
waiver
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
drake,
the
way
you
state
the
question
interests
me.
you
are
not
contending
then
that
there
is
a
statutory
requirement
that
circuit
courts
take
this
view.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
saying
it
is
a
matter...
each
circuit
can
adopt
its
own
rule.
justice
john
paul
stevens
a
permissible
rule
that
is
not
required
by
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
makes
a
lot
of
sense.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
therefore
it
also
follows,
i
guess,
that
it
is
not
a
jurisdictional
rule.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
they
didn't
make
it
retroactive,
so
obviously
they
thought
they
had
jurisdiction
to
go
either
way.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
wouldn't
it
be
too
late,
then?
under
the
sixth
circuit
rule,
it
seems
to
me
if
you
don't
file--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--as
far
as
we
know,
the
sixth
circuit
rule
seems
to
be
an
inflexible
rule.
if
you
don't
file
objections--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--let
me
just
go
back
for
a
second
to
justice
marshall's...
i'm
sorry...
question.
if
after
the
magistrate's
ruling,
your
opponent
had
filed
a
piece
of
paper
which
said
i
object
to
the
magistrate's
rulings
for
the
reasons
stated
in
the
memorandum
i
filed
originally,
period,
that
would
have
been
enough,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
wouldn't
even
be
pro
forma,
because
they
would
have
filed...
you
would
have
spelled
out
his
argument.
well,
i
see
what
your
point
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask...
may
i
interrupt
for
just
a
second?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
your
view
or
the
view
in
the
sixth
circuit
that
a
district
judge
acts
improperly
if
when
there
are
nc
objections
to
the
magistrate's
report
or
file
the
district
judge
decides
on
his
own
initiative
to
review
the
whole
report
and
decide
whether
he
agrees
or
disagrees
with
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
force,
the
effect
of
the
rule
as
i
understand
it,
though,
really
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
what
the
district
judge
may
do.
he
can
still
either
review
or
not
review
his
own
election.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
is
what
congress
seemed
to
be
thinking
about
mostly.
the
whole
force
of
this
rule
is
to
protect
the
court
of
appeals--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--as
i
understand
it
from
reviewing
cases
where
there
was
a
procedural
default
before
the
magistrate,
and
it
is
irrelevant
what
the
district
court
does.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
the
district
court
writes
a
great
long
opinion,
they
will
say
we
won't
bother
reading
the
opinion
because
of
the
failure
at
the
magistrate
level.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
general
rule
would
be--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
this
rule
does
nothing
to
protect
the
district
judge,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
judge
is
free
to
do
it
if
he
has
a
new
magistrate,
he
is
not
confident,
or
something,
he
could--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
once
more?
if
i
understand
your
position
correctly,
say
there
is...
the
district
judge
thought
there
was
merit
to
one
of
the
four
claims
to
which
no
objection
had
been
made.
the
district
judge
would
have
the
power
to
grant
relief.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
court
of
appeals
would
not.
if
the
district
judge
denied
relief,
the
failure
to
object
would
deny
the
court
of
appeals
the
power
to
grant
relief,
if
they
enforce
this
rule
just
automatically.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand,
but
as
a
general
rule,
the
court
of
appeals
said,
we
don't
have
to
look
at
this
appeal
because
there
is
this
failure
here.
affirm.
whereas
the
district
judge
doesn't
have
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
district
judge
just
might
have
been
extremely
conscientious
and
decided
he
wants
to
take
a
good,
hard
look
at
it,
but
the
court
of
appeals
would
just
say
we
don't
have
jurisdiction
because
they
didn't
follow
this
rule.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
there
was
a
proffer
in
the
court
of
appeals,
because
in
the
court
of
appeals
they
said,
look,
there
is
a
meritorious
point
here,
and
the
court
of
appeals
said,
we
are
not
going
to
listen
to
your
argument
because
you
have
failed
to
object
before
the
magistrate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
he
didn't
explain
his
failure
to
object.
i
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
nobody
is
suggesting
it
is.
the
point
is,
what
is
the
power
of
the
court
of
appeals
when
this
set
of
facts
develops?
the
district
court
is
free
to
look
at
it,
as
i
understand;
the
court
of
appeals
is
not,
as
a
normal
practice.
