mr.
richard
david
drake
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
federal
circuit
court
may
condition
appellate
review
upon
the
filing
of
objections
to
the
report
and
recommendation
of
a
federal
magistrate.
mr.
richard
david
drake
no.
mr.
richard
david
drake
yes,
and
i
am
saying
the
sixth
circuit
has
adopted
it
under
its
supervisory
powers.
the
rule
is--
mr.
richard
david
drake
--a
rule
which
is
not
only
permissible,
but--
mr.
richard
david
drake
--fosters
congressional
intent.
i
don't
believe
that
the
magistrates
act
actually
speaks
directly
to
this
question.
the
question
is
whether
the
sixth
circuit
may
do
this,
not
whether
it
is
compelled
to
do
so.
mr.
richard
david
drake
it
is
definitely
not
a
jurisdictional
rule.
mr.
richard
david
drake
they
made
it
prospective
only
to
accommodate
what
i
feel
they
perceive
to
be
potential
due
process
difficulties.
mr.
richard
david
drake
absolutely.
mr.
richard
david
drake
yes.
mr.
richard
david
drake
the
rule
was
promulgated
in
a
case,
united
states
versus
waltars,
which
is
cited
in
the
brief.
the
rule
was
not
even
utilized
in
that
case.
it
was
made
prospective
only
from
the
date
of
that
decision.
mr.
richard
david
drake
no.
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
the
statute
compels
it
perforce,
no.
mr.
richard
david
drake
the
circuits
could
in
their
wisdom,
i
believe,
though,
if
you
look
to
the
congressional
intent
underlying
the
magistrates
act,
a
circuit
who
declines
to
adopt
the
sixth
circuit
rule
is
essentially
for
reasons
unknown
to
me
fostering
upon
itself
review
de
novo.
mr.
richard
david
drake
it
would
be
permissible.
mr.
richard
david
drake
i
think
that
if
affirmance
is
given
in
this
case,
we
might
have
more
circuits
adopting
this
rule
in
their
own
self-interest.
as
i
pointed
out
in
the
brief,
the
difficulty
is
not
uniform
to
all
the
circuits.
for
instance,
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
apparently
has
very
little
difficulty,
if
you
look
at
the
statistics,
whereas
the
fourth,
fifth,
sixth,
and
now
the
eleventh
circuits
are
having
considerable
difficulty.
mr.
richard
david
drake
i
believe
that
is
the
only
question
before
the
court.
mr.
richard
david
drake
as
to
the
district
court,
yes.
mr.
richard
david
drake
because
the
purpose
underlying
the
magistrates
act...
and
it
had
had
a
checkered
history.
the
original
1968
version
encountered
a
series
cf
adverse
judicial
decisions,
including
ones
from
this
court,
and
it
was
in
response
to
your
invitation
and
that
of
the
chief
justice
that
the
1976
amendments
were
actually
enacted.
the
theory
underlying
the
1976
amendments
very
much
parallels
the
master
system
user
in
the
united
kingdom
or
the
referee
system
used
in
most
states
today,
which
is
to
use
non-article
3
jurists,
here
magistrates,
to
delineate
the
scope
of
the
dispute.
oftimes
you
will
have
in
a
civil
case
a
multi-count
complaint
filed.
the
magistrate
might
recommend
summary
judgment
as
to
let's
say
18
of
those,
and
the
litigant
will
then
have...
essentially
the
magistrate
will
serve
as
a
filtration
system,
where
the
litigant
will
then
make
an
intelligent
judgment
as
to
whether
or
not
he
wants
to
proceed.
that
is
the
entire
theory
underlying
this,
that
the
magistrates
will
filter
this
litigation
in
the
nondispositive
context.
the
review
is
under
the
clearly
erroneous
standard.
in
the
dispositive
context,
as
i
said,
the
magistrates
act
did
not
fare
well
in
the
courts.
they
were
very,
very
aware
of
article
3
difficulties,
and
they
made
it
absolutely
clear
that
if
the
litigants
so
desire,
he
could
obtain,
he
had
the
opportunity
to
obtain
review
anew,
but
he
could
forfeit
that
opportunity.
this
case
is
tantamount
in
my
opinion
strictly
to
a
failure
to
prosecute
or
any
other
procedural
default.
mr.
richard
david
drake
in
other
words,
you
are
saying,
suppose
the
objections
would
have
been
filed,
your
honor?
mr.
richard
david
drake
you
mean
initially,
when
he
initiated
this
litigation,
your
honor?
mr.
richard
david
drake
no,
your
honor,
i
don't.
mr.
richard
david
drake
your
honor,
i
think
there
is
a
misstatement
or
misunderstanding
here.
after
the
magistrate
issued
the
report
and
recommendation,
the
only
thing
he
filed
was
a
motion
for
extension
of
time.
he
never
refiled
anything
in
the
district
court,
anything
of
any--
mr.
richard
david
drake
--when
he
essentially
filled
out
the
form,
the
habeas
corpus
form,
which
is
provided
for
in
the
rules,
and
he
also
attached
thereto
a
brief
reiterating
the
claims
he
has
made
in
the
state
courts--
mr.
richard
david
drake
--that
was
referred
to
the
magistrate,
yes.
mr.
richard
david
drake
yes,
and
considered
by
the
magistrate
in
conjunction
with
briefs
filed
by
the
state
of
ohio
and
a
very
voluminous
transcript.
mr.
richard
david
drake
with
the
clerk's
office,
when
he
initiated
this
action--
mr.
richard
david
drake
--right,
he
filed
the
petition
and
a
brief
in
conjunction
therewith.
that
is
all
he
ever
filed
except
for
the
motion
for
extension
of
time--
mr.
richard
david
drake
--except
for
a
motion
for
extension
of
time,
he
filed
nothing.
mr.
richard
david
drake
nothing.
surprising,
he
didn't
even
file
a
59e
motion
to
alter
or
amend
judgment,
which
probably
would
have
avoided
this
question
also,
at
least
many
circuits
have
held.
it
wasn't
too
late
even
when
the
judgment
was
issued,
in
my
opinion,
but--
mr.
richard
david
drake
--the
sixth
circuit
has
never
really
addressed
the
issue.
mr.
richard
david
drake
no,
your
honor.
--first
of
all,
the
sixth
circuit
rule
is
not
inflexible
at
all.
as
i
pointed
out
in
the
brief,
there
was
a
pro
se
litigant,
and
the
sixth
circuit
found
in
that
instance
that
there
was
cause
for
the
failure
to...
the
procedural
default,
and
wanted
to
avoid
a
manifest
injustice.
the
rule
is
not
inflexible,
and
we
are
not
talking
about
jurists
who
are
unreasonable.
mr.
richard
david
drake
the
sixth
circuit
has
never
addressed
it.
what
you
are
talking
about...
in
any
published
decision,
in
any
event.
what
you
are
talking
about
is
the
pro
forma
blanket
objection.
i
don't
know.
i
can't
answer
your
question.
i
don't
know
if
they
would
hold
an
attorney
at
law--
mr.
richard
david
drake
--i
think
that
in
the
case
of
a
pro
se
applicant,
that
would
be
sufficient.
he
is
doing
the
best
he
can.
here
we
are
talking
about
someone
who
is
admitted
to
the
bar,
and
in
point
of
fact
mr.
stanley
had
filed
four
claims.
when
he
went
to
the
sixth
circuit,
he
abandoned
three
of
those.
here
we
have
a
district
judge
who
sui
sponte
took
it
upon
himself
to
unnecessarily
waste
time
on
three
claims
which
obviously
he
had
intended
to
abandon
anyway.
the
act
would
have
worked
in
this
instance.
he
would
have
filed
objections
in
theory
on
only
one
of
the
four
claims,
and
judge
conti,
who
at
that
time
had
been
elevated
to
the
circuit
court,
would
not
have
had
to
deal
with
75
percent
of
this
litigation,
your
honor,
and
that
is
what
the
sixth
circuit
is
trying
to
do,
not
take
away
someone's
right
to
appeal,
but
merely
mandate
that
they
perfect
that
right
to
appeal,
and
not...
here
we
have
not
only
a
failure
to
file
objections,
but
in
the
sixth
circuit
mr.
stanley
did
not
so
much
as
file
a
reply
brief
indicating
why
he
hadn't
filed
the
objections.
even
though
our
brief
dealt
at
length
and
initially
with
this
question,
mr.
stanley
did
not
appear
at
the
oral
argument.
the
circuit
court
below
had
neither
written
nor
oral
explanation
as
to
why
these
objections
were
not
filed.
mr.
richard
david
drake
for
instance,
your
honor,
you
are
indicating
perhaps
judge
conti
would
have
granted
the
writ
as
to
one
of
these
claims?
mr.
richard
david
drake
had
judge
conti
granted
the
writ
as
to
one
of
these
claims,
and
i
here
have
to
speculate
to
some
degree,
because
it
has
never
really
arisen
in
the
sixth
circuit,
but
it
would
be
my
judgment
the
state
of
ohio
could
appeal,
that
mr.
stanely
could
appeal
raising
as
the
sole
ground
for
affirmance
that
relied
upon
in
the
district
court,
and
could
neither
file
cross
appeal
nor
could
he
rely
upon
the
other
three
grounds
that
were
not
considered
by
judge
conti.
i
think
that
would
be
the
logical
extension
of
what
the
sixth
circuit
states.
mr.
richard
david
drake
if
the
sixth
circuit
in
the
case
where
the
writ
is
granted--
mr.
richard
david
drake
--tried
to--
mr.
richard
david
drake
--i
can't
imagine
myself
ever
making
that
argument,
and
i
don't
think
the
sixth
circuit
could
do
that.
mr.
richard
david
drake
would
prohibit
it?
nothing
would
come
to
mind
except
for
a
general
concept
of
fairness,
your
honor.
i
can't
imagine
a
circuit
court
ever
doing
that.
i
am
unaware
of
any
remotely
analogous
situation.
mr.
richard
david
drake
i
think
it--
mr.
richard
david
drake
--i
think
the
notice--
mr.
richard
david
drake
--i
think
that--
mr.
richard
david
drake
--some
circuit
courts
have
had
difficulty
with
this,
and
i
think
that
the
sixth
circuit
has
taken
the
wiser
course
and
mandated
the
notice
be
so
specific
that
any
child
who
really
can
read
or
write
at
all
could
understand
that
notice.
here
we
are
talking
about
some
people
that
are
in
prison
but
aren't
that
educated,
and
i
am
certain
that
if
you
can
read
at
all
you
understand
what
that
notice
means.
it
is
not
ambivalent
or
ambiguous
to
any
extent
whatsoever,
and
i
think
mr.
stanley's
contrary
assertion
is
sheer
sophistry,
your
honor.
that
is
a
very
explicit
notice.
and
it
is
even
in
capital
letters,
as
you
can
see
at
page
50
of
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
richard
david
drake
if
there
were
no
notice?
yes.
for
instance,
in
the
united
states
versus
walters
itself
had
the
sixth
circuit
promulgated
a
supervisory
role,
and
in
that
case
it
would
have
taken
away
the
right,
the
government's
right
to
appeal,
as
it
turns
out,
but
had
it
gone
the
other
way,
i
do
see
due
process
concerns.
i
think
that
notice
is
absolutely
essential.
mr.
richard
david
drake
no,
your
honor.
for
instance,
had
there
been
a
rule,
any
rule
of
appellate
procedure
is
not
obviously
incorporated
in
every
order
of
a
court.
attorneys
are
deemed
to
be
on
notice,
and
are
to
some
degree
pro
se
litigants,
are
deemed
to
be
on
notice
of
rules
that
are
long
standing.
this
court
doesn't
for
instance,
send
me
rules
of
practice
every
time
i
come
here,
but
i
think
that
the
rule...
it
is
the
wiser
course,
because
we
are--
mr.
richard
david
drake
--i
think
notice
is
constitutionally
mandated,
the
fact
that
you
actually
put
it
in
every
pleading,
which
is
what
happens
in
the
sixth
circuit.
every
report
and
recommendation--
mr.
richard
david
drake
--your
honor,
i
meant
that
for
instance
if
a
circuit
court
came
up
with
some
supervisory
rule
that
took
litigants
by
surprise
and
made
it
retroactive
to
appeals
which
were
pending,
i
would
have
some
difficulty--
mr.
richard
david
drake
--right,
which
is
what
we
have
here,
is
essentially
a
rule
which
the
sixth
circuit
perceives,
and
i
agree,
is
very
congruent
with
the
intents
underlying
the
magistrates
act.
you
simply
cannot
have
your
article
3
district
judge
being
bypassed
and,
sandbagged.
the
idea
is
to
serve
as
some
sort
of
filtration
system.
congress
certainly
did
not
mean
to
aid
article
3
district
judges
and
to
the
detriment
of
article
3
circuit
court
judges.
mr.
richard
david
drake
he
did
not
take
full
advantage
of
the
latitude
which
congress
gave
him.
perhaps
that
might...
i
have
no
idea
why
judge
conti
did
what
he
did.
it
certainly
was
not
incumbent
upon
him
to
do
so.
mr.
richard
david
drake
i
honestly
do
not
know,
obviously,
your
honor,
why
he
did
what
he
did.
mr.
richard
david
drake
i
would
agree.
here
notice,
express
notice
was
given,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
acknowledges
that
he
got
the
notice.
the
fact
that
he
filed
the
motion
for
extension
of
time,
which
was
granted,
is
indicative
of
that
fact.
there
is
no
dispute
that...
the
only
dispute
is
his
belated
misinterpretation
of
what
that
fairly
plain
language
meant,
your
honor.
but
once
again,
i
would
point
out
that
we
are
here
dealing
with
a
court
who
has
decided
to
exercise
its
supervisory
power.
reversal
can
only
obtain
if
that
supervisory
power
is
repugnant
either
to
the
constitution
or
statute.
mr.
stanley
has
pointed
out
no
repugnancy
that
i
can
ascertain.
he
simply
disagrees
with
the
wisdom
of
the
supervisory
rule.
here
i
believe
that,
and
i
believe
the
statistics
indicate
that
there
should
be
some
latitude
here
for
the
various
circuits
to
operate
in
the
manner
that
they
wish
to
operate
absent
some
repugnancy
to
an
overriding
statute
or
the
constitution.
and
no
one
has
said
that
this
rule
is
mandated
nationwide.
some
circuits,
particularly
the
eighth
circuit,
obviously
doesn't
perceive
the
need
to
have
such
a
rule.
if
they
want
to
allow
district
judges
to
be
bypassed,
congress
has
indicated
that
they
can
do
so,
i
believe.
i
believe
that
if
the
court
below
is
affirmed,
perhaps
circuit
courts
will
feel
a
little
more
latitude
and
be
a
little
more
receptive
to
the
sixth
circuit
rule.
what
mr.
stanley
is
attempting
to
do
is
relieve
himself
of
the
obligation
as
an
officer
of
the
court
to
apprise
the
court
of
the
fact
that
he
is
dissatisfied
with
a
portion
of
the
magistrate's
report
or,
for
that
matter,
the
whole
thing,
and
he
is
putting
the
onus
on
the
judiciary
to
do
his
job.
this
is
precisely
what
the
circuit
court
said
we
are
not
going
to
allow
this
to
happen.
this
is
no
different
than
any
other
legitimate
procedural
requisite.
it
is
just
that
congress
said
to
file
the
brief,
to
file
a
timely
notice
of
appeal,
to
appear
at
a
pretrial
conference,
to
give
discovery.
essentially
what
we
have
here
is
a
failure
to
prosecute,
and
we
have
a
totally
unexcused
failure
to
prosecute.
i
have
no
idea--
mr.
richard
david
drake
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
david
drake
i
don't
know
what
the
sixth
circuit
view
on
that
would
be,
your
honor.
what
judge
conti
did
in
this
case
is
highly
unusual,
though,
as
a
matter
of
common
practice.
mr.
richard
david
drake
yes.
mr.
richard
david
drake
that's
right.
mr.
richard
david
drake
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
david
drake
i
don't
believe
that
they
would
say
in
each
and
every
instance
some
inflexible--
mr.
richard
david
drake
--yes.
mr.
richard
david
drake
the
district
judge
is...
in
point
of
fact
what
really
happens
is
the
district
judge
ordinarily
does
not
do
what
judge
conti
did
here.
put
the
rule
is
not
designed
to
protect
him.
i
doubt
if
it
could.
mr.
richard
david
drake
if
the
judge,
for
instance,
got
a
new
group
of
law
clerks
and
wants
to
let
them
practice,
he
wants
to
review
these
magistrate
reports,
he
certainly
is
privileged
to
do
so,
and
i
would
have
great
problems
if
the
circuit
court
told
him
he
couldn't
do
that.
mr.
richard
david
drake
yes.
mr.
richard
david
drake
which...
and
this
is
a
classic
case,
your
honor.
there
is
only
one
complaint
before
this
court
on
the
merits,
and
there
were
four
originally.
presumably
mr.
stanley
would
have
objected
only
as
to
this
battered
wife
syndrome
question,
abandoned
the
other
three
claims,
with
a
considerable
savings
of
time
in
the
long
run
to
judges
like
judge
conti.
the
judges
should
not
be
presumed
to
be
forced
or
compelled
to
do
what
mr.
stanley
wants
when
the
litigants
are
not
before
him
complaining.
mr.
richard
david
drake
yes.
mr.
richard
david
drake
once
again,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
it
has
been
erected
as
an
inflexible
jurisdiction.
mr.
richard
david
drake
you
might
well
have
a
proffer
here
that
mr.
stanley
was
in
the
hospital,
that
he
was
ill.
mr.
richard
david
drake
absent
at
least
a
proffer
of
cause
and
an
indication
of...
you
might
even
have,
at
last
in
the
judgment
of
one
of
the
judges
below,
some
indication
of
manifest
injustice,
because
he
thought
there
was
some
merit.
i
disagree
with
him
as
to
that
point,
but
it
is
the
two
prongs.
here
there
was
not
so
much
as
a
proffer.
your
honor,
the
motion
for
rehearing
which
was
the
first
instance--
mr.
richard
david
drake
--but
there
was...
mr.
stanley
never
gave
a
proffer
as
to
why
he
failed
to
do
this.
mr.
richard
david
drake
in
a
motion
for
rehearing,
your
honor,
he
said,
ant
i
am
quoting,
"counsel
is
the
one
who
screwed
up.
"
that
is
a
quote,
and
he
did
not
elaborate.
your
honor,
that
does
not...
that
does
not
to
me
equate
with
cause
here.
i
mean,
this
entire
case
is
to
alleviate
one
individual
in
a
habeas
corpus
action
from
exercising
his
duties
as
an
officer
of
the
court,
and
we
are
at
the
united
states
supreme
court.
this
is
not
a
onerous
burden
put
on
counsel,
your
honor,
in
my
opinion,
and
particularly--
mr.
richard
david
drake
--i
don't
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
saying
that
the
district
court
can't
look
at
it,
your
honor,
if
i
understand
your
question.
they
are
saying
that
in
what
we
consider
to
be
this
sort
of
a
sandbagging
scenario,
we
will
not
transfer
ourselves
into
essentially
the
first
article
3
court
that
reviews
the
substance
of
these
claims.
and
as
my
brief
points
out,
the
circuits
which
have
adopted
this
rule
are
the
circuits
which
are
inundated
with
precisely
these
kinds
of
cases,
because
certain
circuits...
for
instance,
the
district
of
columbia
doesn't
have
that
many
prisoner
petitions,
i
presuppose,
at
least
according
to
the
statistics,
whereas
the
fifth,
the
eleventh,
the
fourth
and
the
sixth
do.
and
again,
i
am
not
asking
for
some
nationwide
rule
of
uniformity.
i
am
simply
making
the
point
that
i
believe
the
sixth
circuit
has
taken
the
wiser
course.
and
even
if
it
is
not
the
wiser
course,
it
is
not
one
that
is
repugnant
to
the
statute
or
the
united
states
constitution.
mr.
richard
david
drake
your
honor,
procedural
default
seems
to--
mr.
richard
david
drake
--yes.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
engel
versus
isaac
arouse
out
of
the
sixth
circuit.
they
had
jurisdiction
to
hear
those
claims,
but
because
of
the
preprocedural
default,
they
were
not...
they
could
not
do
it
essentially.
it
is
not
the
power
to
review
here.
we
are
talking
about
the
supervisory
rule,
which
was
only
given
after
this
express
notice,
and
the
rarity
of
these
cases
is
demonstrated
by
this
case,
i
believe.
i
mean,
you
do
not
see
a
flood
of
instance
where
the
sixth
circuit
has
to
invoke
this
rule
even
against
pro
se
litigants,
and
as
i
have
indicated,
it
is
not
an
inflexible
barrier,
jurisdictional
or
otherwise,
because
they
have
at
least
in
one
reported
decision
granted
leave
to
review
those
merits
when
there
was
a
proffer
of
cause
and
a
feeling
that
there
had
been
an
injustice
by
the
magistrate's
ruling,
your
honor.
are
there
any
further
questions?
mr.
richard
david
drake
thank
you.
