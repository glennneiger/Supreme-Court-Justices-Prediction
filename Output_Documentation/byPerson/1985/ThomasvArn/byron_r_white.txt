justice

whether
the
district
court
purported
to
review
the
report
de
novo
or
not,
the
only
time
that
you
get
an
appealable
judgment
is
when
the
district
judge
enters
an
order.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
any
case,
it
is
going
to
be
a
district
court
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
do
you
say...
why
does
that
raise
a
problem
under
article
3?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
taking
a
lot
of
your
time
on
this
article
3
issue.
you
have
got
something
else
going,
haven't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
always
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
may
not
be
a
difference
after
this
case
is
decided.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
this
the
same
brief
you
gave
the
magistrate?
justice
byron
r.
white
aren't
you
going
to
argue
that
the
statute
forbids
this,
for
heaven's
sake?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
article
3
would
make
the
statute
irrelevant.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
one
of
your
arguments
that
the
statute
on
its
face
and
its
legislative
history
forbids
this
result?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
do
you
think
there
is
any
difference
between
the
magistrate's
recommendations
on
factual
findings
as
opposed
to
points
of
law?
as
i
understand
your
argument,
it
makes
no
difference
which
it
is,
an
issue
of
law
or
of
fact.
there
is
no
waiver
in
your
view.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that...
is
their
rule
limited
to
the
cases
where
the
defendant
gets
notice?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
is
that
your
position
also?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
if
he
doesn't
get
notice,
there
can
be
no
waiver?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
it
is...
you
don't
push
for
any
wider
waiver
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you...
i
take
it
the
answer
to
justice
stevens
that
other
circuits
could
have
just
the
contrary
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
would
be
permissible,
you
are
saying.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
urge
us
then
to
try
to
make
the
rule
uniform
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
there
is
a
question
as
to
whether
this
was
a
proper
exercise
of
the
supervisory
power.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
congress
did
indicate
what
a
penalty
for
failure
to
file
was,
or
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
should
a
court
impose
a
further
penalty
for
failure
to
file?
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
he
file
something
with
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
certainly
wouldn't
need
to
reach
any
constitutional
argument
if
notice
weren't
provided
by
the
court
rule.
all
you
would
have
to
say
or
hold
here
is
that
it
was
an
improvident
exercise
of
his
supervisory
power
not
to
require
noticed.
you
wouldn't
have
to
reach
any
constitutional
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
--the
only
time
the
judge
is
really
required
to
give
de
novo
review
is
if
there
is
an
objection.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
the
objection
only
runs...
goes
to
part
of
the
report,
that
is
all
he
has
to
give
de
novo
review
of.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
say
it
is
a
jurisdictional
rule,
do
you?
