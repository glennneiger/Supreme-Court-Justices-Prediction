we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
thomas
against
the
superintendent
of
the
ohio
reformatory
for
women.
mr.
stanley,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
consumed
17
minutes
now
on
this
point.
if
you
want
to
save
some
time
for
the
other
matters,
you
should
get
on
to
it.
i
must
say
that
if
you
are
right,
then
even
if
congress
said
you
either
object
or
you
waive,
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
drake?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
stanley?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
