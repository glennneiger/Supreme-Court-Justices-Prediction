justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
in
this
instance,
how
was
article
3
violated,
because
by
your
own
statement
the
district
court
did
give
review
to
the
magistrate's
finding
here,
and
the
finding
became
the
district
court
finding.
now,
if
you
make
no
objections
in
the
district
court,
if
the
proceedings
at
trial
have
been
in
the
district
court
initially,
a
court
of
appeals
is
not
going
to
consider
things
that
aren't
raised
at
the
district
court
level.
why
should
it
be
different
with
the
magistrate's
report
that
is
considered
by
the
district
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
effect
is
the
same.
in
either
event
the
court
of
appeals
wouldn't
be
hearing
it.
isn't
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
stanley,
how
is
conditioning
an
appeal
in
these
cases
on
filing
of
objections
any
different
than
conditioning
an
appeal
on
the
timely
filing
of
a
brief
or
payment
of
a
filing
fee
or
something
of
that
kind?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
even
so,
can't
the
courts
enforce
a
requirement
filing
memos
and
briefs
on
timely
basis
and
so
forth?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
why
not
this?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
drake,
what
about
a
situation
when
the
district
court
sui
sponte
alters
the
finding
or
recommendation
of
the
magistrate
on,
for
example,
a
point
of
law,
and
no
objections
had
been
filled
in
a
timely
basis,
but
the
district
court
on
its
own
reaches
some
legal
conclusion
different
from
the
magistrate's
recommendation.
would
there
have
to
be
a
right
to
appeal
from
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
if
a
circuit
nevertheless
tried
to
apply
the
waiver
rule,
would
there
be
anything
in
the
statutory
scheme
or
the
constitution
to
prevent
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
enforce
a
waiver.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
there
anything
in
the
statutes
or
the
constitution
that
would
prohibit
a
circuit
from
having
so
stringent
a
rule
of
waiver?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
specific
do
you
think
the
notice
must
be?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
here
it
was
quite
specific--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but
what
if
it
weren't?
what
if
it
were
a
general
notice?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
you
might
lose
your
right
to
appeal?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
there
were
no
notice,
or
if
the
rule
did
not
allow
an
appeal
in
the
other
circumstance,
i
suggest,
does
that
raise
due
process
concerns
then,
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
drake,
the
sixth
circuit,
as
i
understood
it,
acknowledged
that
it
had
jurisdiction
of
an
appeal,
but
it
dismissed
it
for
failure
to
make
the
objection
below,
just
as
it
might
refuse
to
entertain
an
appeal
on
other
issues
that
aren't
raised
below.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
isn't
that
right?
