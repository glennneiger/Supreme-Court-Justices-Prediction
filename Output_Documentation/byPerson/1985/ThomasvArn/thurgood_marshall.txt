mr.
stanley,
if
you
had
filed
objections,
would
you
be
here
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
of
this
is
brought
about
by
your
failure
to
file
a
piece
of
paper.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
is
what
we
are
using
our
time
up
for.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
what
we
are
using
our
time
up
for.
justice
thurgood
marshall
one
point.
is
your
only
point
the
fact
that
you
don't
have
to
file
an
objection?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
what
i
am
trying
to
do.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
is
the
only
point
that
is
here,
isn't
it?
do
you
agree?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
want
us
to
say
that
the
rule
of
the
circuit
is
wrong.
justice
thurgood
marshall
unconstitutional.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
part
of
the
constitution
does
it
violate?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
five?
which
one
are
you...
which
amendment
are
you
talking
about?
justice
thurgood
marshall
five
and
fourteen.
and
that
denies
you
due
process?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
what
else
would
you
have
filed
with
the
court
under
an
objection
more
than
the
20
pages
that
you
filed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
what
are
we
complaining
about
other
than
that
you
just
don't
like
filing
a
piece
of
paper?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
say
that
you
wouldn't
file
it
again?
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
we
send
it
back.
will
you
file
it
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
still
trying
to
find
out
what
is
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
the
20-page
paper
that
he
filed,
suppose
the
first
page
of
it
said
i
object
for
the
following
reasons.
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
he
said,
"i
object
for
the
following
reasons.
"
that
is
all
he
put
on
the
top
of
the
20-page
thing
he
filed.
would
that
be
satisfactory?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
this
20-page
thing
he
is
talking
about?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
did
he
file
with
the
district
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i...
the
district
court
means
clerk's
office.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
after
the
magistrate
ruled,
he
didn't
file
anything
else.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
filed
nothing.
