mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
if
it
please
the
court,
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
audience,
it
is
an
honor
to
appear
before
the
court.
i
understand
from
the
clerk
that
this
is
the
50th
anniversary
of
the
very
first
argument
in
this
building,
so
i
am
doubly
honored
that
i
am
appearing
before
the
court.
i
would
first
express
what
i
would
consider
my
mea
culpa.
i
wish
that
i
had
filed
objections
in
this
case.
it
would
have
prevented
having
to
come
up
to
the
supreme
court
for
the
decision
in
this
case.
it
would
have
prevented
a
lot
of
time
from
having
to
be
expended
on
this
case.
however,
i
didn't,
and
i
think
that
given
the
case
law
involved
in
this
court
and
the
circuits
that
it
wasn't
necessary,
and
i
would
like
to
proceed
with
the
argument.
a
little
history
of
the
case.
my
client
was
charged
with
murder
in
cuyahoga
county
in
cleveland,
where
she
was
convicted.
on
appeal,
judge
krensler,
who
is
now
a
federal
district
court
judge
in
cleveland,
held
that
from
the
current
psychological
and
sociological
research
has
emerged
a
profile
of
a
battered
woman
as
one
who
displays
unique
behavioral
patterns
and
psychological
characteristics
as
well
as
differences
in
reaction
and
perception,
all
of
which
are
not
within
the
knowledge
of
the
average
juror.
he
concluded
that
without
expert
testimony
on
the
battered
woman
syndrome,
a
jury
would
be
unable
to
have
a
sufficient
comprehension
of
the
defendant's
state
of
mind
at
the
time
of
the
homicide.
the
ohio
supreme
court
granted
review
of
the
case
and
reversed
the
reversal.
i
then
went
to
the
federal
district
court
judge
in
cleveland.
it
was
referred
to
a
magistrate,
who
recommended
that
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
be
denied.
the
district
court
judge
had
a
de
novo
determination.
notwithstanding
the
failure
to
file
objections,
the
sixth
circuit,
implementing
what
is
now
known
as
the
walters
policy,
held
that
by
failing
to
object
to
the
magistrate's
report,
one
waives
the
right
to
appeal
to
the
circuit
from
the
district
court
order.
i
then
petitioned
for
cert
and
this
court
granted
it.
there
are
basically
four
points
i
would
like
to
make
on
argument
today.
the
first
and
most
important
one
is
the
interplay
between
the
magistrate's
act
and
article
3
of
the
united
states
constitution.
when
our
forefathers
were
setting
up
the
new
government
after
the
revolutionary
war,
they
were
very
wary
of
putting
all
the
governmental
power,
basically
the
legislative,
executive,
and
judiciary,
into
the
same
hands.
accordingly,
they
felt
that
it
was
necessary
that
there
be
an
independent
judiciary.
they
wrote
article
3.
article
3
basically
says
that
there
shall
be
a
supreme
court
and
such
inferior
courts
as
congress
may
establish.
it
also
said
that
those
courts
were
to
be
staffed
by
judges
who
have
life
tenure
and
a
set
salary.
i
must
admit
that
article
3
at
first
blush
seems
a
relatively
simple
statement
of
fact.
it
spawned
a
great
deal
of
litigation
in
this
court.
i
do
not
pretend
to
understand
article
3
and
the
litigation
it
has
spawned,
particularly
in
such
cases
as
northern
pipeline.
however,
with
regard
to
the
interplay
between
article
3
and
the
magistrates
act,
this
court
has
quite
clearly
stated
what
the
law
is.
now,
the
magistrates
act
was
provided
in
congress
in
1976
and
subsequently
amended
basically
to
set
up
a
series
of
inferior
judicial
officers,
inferior,
that
is,
to
the
district
courts,
to
help
the
district
courts
with
the
overwhelming
case
law
that
they
were
being
presented
with.
basically,
they
may
consider
nondispositive
pretrial
matters,
conduct
evidentiary
hearings
of
dispositive
motions,
habeas
corpus,
et
cetera.
in
the
section
that
we
are
dealing
with
here,
that
is,
28
usc
636(b)(1)(b),
they
can
conduct
hearings
on
a
habeas
corpus
and
then
provide
the
judge
with
proposed
findings
of
fact
and
recommendations
for
disposition
by
the
judge.
parties
may
file
objections,
and
the
judge
shall
make
a
de
novo
determination
of
those
portions
of
the
report
objected
to.
however,
the
last
sentence,
i
think,
is
the
key.
the
court
may
accept,
reject,
or
modify
the
report.
this
court
in
several
cases
has
considered
the
interplay
between
article
3
and
the
magistrates
act,
most
often
through
the
pen
of
chief
justice
burger.
the
basic
cases
are
the
united
states
versus
raddatz
and
mathews
versus
weber.
this
court
quite
clearly
has
said
the
magistrates
act
is
constitutional
because
the
ultimate
decisionmaking
rests
with
the
united
states
district
court.
those
cases
basically
came
up
with
three
points.
one,
in
going
over
the
legislative
history
of
the
magistrates
act,
this
court
has
said
congress
was
sensitive
to
the
article
3
considerations.
they
were
sensitive
to
not
putting
in
a
magistrate
article
3
duties.
hence
this
court
stressed
and
congress
stressed
that
the
ultimate
adjudicatory
determination
was
reserved
to
the
district
court.
the
second
point
this
court
has
made
in
raddatz
and
mathews
is,
the
court
says
that
the
ultimate
authority
and
responsibility
to
make
an
informed
formal
determination
must
remain
with
the
judge.
three,
the
court
stressed
the
magistrate's
role
is
one
of
helping
the
court
to
narrow
the
dispute,
focusing
on
the
legal
issues.
however,
it
again
stressed
the
court
alone
remains
the
ultimate
decisionmaker.
in
sum,
this
court
said
in
raddatz
and
weber,
the
delegation
of
the
magistrate
to
hear
issues
does
not
violate
article
3
so
long
as
the
ultimate
decision
is
made
by
the
district
court.
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
yes.
in
the--
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
--in
the
printed
portion
cf
the
magistrate's
report,
at
the
very
end,
contained
what
i
now
recognize
to
be
notice
that
if
i
don't
file
objections,
there
would
be
a
waiver.
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
yes,
they
did.
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
no,
i
did
not.
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
i--
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
--two
or
three...
whatever
the
time.
i
don't
remember.
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
first
of
all,
if
i
may
say,
the
issues
were
fully
briefed.
when
i
filed
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus,
i
included
with
it
a
memorandum
of
law
concerning
the
issues
i
was
to
raise.
it
was
approximately
20
pages
long.
in
my
opinion,
this
court's
decisions
in
raddatz
and
weber
mandate
independent
judicial
review
of
the
magistrate's
report
by
a
district
court.
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
no,
on
the
initiative...
what
is
included
in
626(b)(1)(b).
that
is,
failure
to
object...
the
penalty
for
failure
to
object
as
enunciated
by
congress
is
no
de
novo
determination,
he
court
may
accept,
reject,
or
modify
the
report
of
the
magistrate.
it
seems
that
this
court
has
quite
clearly
said
the
court
must
be
the
ultimate
decisionmaker.
otherwise,
you
have
a
situation
where
the
magistrate
ends
up
being
an
article
3
judge.
for
instance,
in
the
sixth--
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
--well,
probably
not,
but
hopefully
i
would
have
won
down
there
and
you
would
have
accepted
it
anyway.
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
that's
correct.
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
pardon?
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
it
is
a
much
more
serious
matter
than
that.
here
we
have
raddatz
and
weber
requiring
a
district
court
judge
to
make
a
final
determination.
the
walters
policy
as
enunciated
by
the
sixth
circuit
and
other
circuits
in
their
policies
have
stated
that
the
district
court
doesn't
really
even
have
to
consider
the
case
if
you
don't
file
objections.
that
raises
a
magistrate
to
the
ultimate
decisionmaker
in
a
case.
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
well,
i
disagree
with
you,
justice
rehnquist.
first
of
all,
the
magistrate's
report
is
not
a
final
appealable
order.
congress
in
writing
the
statute
says,
if
there
are
no
objections,
the
district
court
doesn't
have
to
make
a
de
novo
review,
but
the
district
court
still
must
consider
the
case.
it
must
be
the
ultimate
decisionmaker.
the
district
court
then
making
an
independent
review
but
with
the
magistrate
having
focused
the
issues
spends
much
less
time
on
the
case,
makes
a
determination,
and
that
is...
it
is
from
that--
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
--i
am
not
going
to
disagree
with
you,
your
honor.
however,
it
seems
to
me,
for
instance,
in
this
case,
where
i
had
filed
a
20-page
brief,
the
issues
were
before
the
court.
it
was
an
issue
of
law.
this
is
the
sixth
court
that
my
client
has
been
to,
that
i
have
been
to
on
her
behalf.
to
say
that
there
is
a
waiver
of
anything
is,
in
my
opinion,
untenable.
we
have...
i
raised
the
issue.
i
briefed
the
issue.
the
magistrate
came
to
a
different
conclusion.
all
the
district
court
judge
had
to
do
is
in
fact
what
he
did
dc,
because
he
did
conduct
a
de
novo
determination
anyway.
what
he
did
do
was
read
my
brief,
read
the
magistrate's
report,
come
to
a
conclusion.
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
well,
justice
o'connor,
if
one
reads
the
opinions
in
the
circuits,
there
is
only
one
circuit,
the
fourth,
which
discusses
this
issue
in
terms
of
procedural
default.
the
sixth
circuit
does
not
talk
in
terms
of
procedural
default.
the
sixth
circuit
says
specifically
you
waive
your
right
to
appeal,
period.
now,
in
a
procedural
default,
you
are
not
waiving
your
right
to
appeal.
you
still
have
the
right
to
appeal,
but
the
circuit
court
says
you
didn't
preserve
it
below.
it
seems
to
me--
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
--that's
correct,
but
it
seems
to
me
in
a
situation
like
this
it
is
a
question
of
form
over
substance.
where
you
have,
number
one,
a
brief
on
the
issue,
the
matters
that
are
in
issue
before
the
court
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner
and
the
magistrate's
report,
you
have
a
right
as
enunciated
by
congress
to
appeal
from
the
denial
of
a
habeas
corpus.
that
is
an
independent
right
that
congress
has
seen
fit
to
give
to
a
petitioner
in
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
i
don't
know
that
a
court
can
say
we
are
going
to
ignore
congress
and
we
are
going
to
impose
this
penalty.
further--
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
--that's
correct.
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
reflects
that
there
was
a--
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
--that's
correct.
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
on
the
district
court?
no,
i
did
not.
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
that
is
correct.
i
filed
a
notice
from
the
judgment
entry
of
the
district
court,
notice
of
appeal
to
the
sixth
circuit.
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
that's
correct.
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
that's
correct.
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
well,
to
be
honest
with
you,
judge,
as
you
pointed
out
in
your
dissent
in
northern
pipeline,
i
am
not
convinced
that
i
know
what--
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
--yes,
your
honor.
only
because
article
3
in
interpreting
the
magistrates
act
has
said
the
reason
that
it
is
constitutional
is
that
the
decisionmaker
must
be
the
district
court.
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
that's
correct,
and
since
the
district
court
must
review
the
magistrate's
report,
whether
objections
are
filed
or
not,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
walters
policy
and
the
other
circuits
are
wrong
when
they
say
that
there
is
a
waiver
of
the
right
to
appeal,
because--
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
--i
would
agree
with
you.
a
second
point
that
i
wish
to
make
in
my
remaining
13
minutes--
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
--certainly.
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
well,
their
writing,
the
language
that
they
said
was,
although
you
may
file...
objections
is
something
that
you
may
or
may
not
do,
we
feel
they
felt
that
under
the
supervisor
power
they
could
force
this
issue
by
making
it
a
rule
in
the
sixth
circuit.
one
of
the
dangers
of
that
in
my
opinion,
justice
stevens,
is
the
fact
that
different
circuits
have
different
rules
for
jurisdiction,
and
if
we
go
to
what
was
going
to
be
my
third
point,
which
is
that
the
courts
cannot
limit
their
own
jurisdiction
that
congress
has
given
them,
in
different
circuits
some
people
can
appeal.
in
four
of
the
circuits
you
can
appeal
no
matter
what
the
magistrate
does,
whether
or
not
you
file
objections
or
not,
you
can
appeal
from
the
denial
of
a
habeas.
in
the
sixth
circuit
you
cannot
appeal
from
a
denial
if
you
do
not
file
objections.
in
one
of
the
circuits
they
talk
about
procedural
default,
and
one
of
the
circuits,
the
eighth
circuit,
rejects
the
waiver
theory.
so,
you
have
differing
jurisdictions
of
the
court
of
appeals
as
a
result
from
these
differing
policies
with
regard
to
whether
or
not
you
file
objections.
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
hopefully
not.
my
second
argument
is
a
due
process
argument
as
it
was
enunciated
in
united
states
versus
raddatz
by
the
chief
justice,
which
basically
says
that
what
due
process
you
are
entitled
to
is
appropriate
to
the
nature
of
the
case.
citing
mathews
versus
aldridge,
it
goes
into
the
question
of
private
interests,
the
risk
of
erroneous
determination
by
reason
and
process
supported,
and
the
public
interest
in
administrative
burdens.
it
seems
to
me
that
when
we
where
talking
about
the
great
petition
of
habeas
corpus,
and
where
congress
has
required
the
right
to
appeal
as
giving
you
that
right,
that
due
process
requires
in
habeas
corpus
that
the
ultimate
decisionmaking
be
with
the
district
court,
and
that
the
right
to
appeal
be
given
to
a
petitioner.
i
have
already
mentioned
in
reference
to
justice
stevens'
argument
my
third
point,
which
is
that
i
do
not
believe
that
the
courts
can
limit
their
own
jurisdiction.
i
would
say
that
in
summation,
that
walters
is
wrong
because
it
limits
their
jurisdiction.
congress
never
said
in
its
statute
that
a
failure
to
object
is
a
waiver.
there
already
exists
a
penalty
for
failure
to
object,
which
is,
you
do
not
get
a
de
novo
determination.
the
statute
says,
if
there
are
objections,
there
shall
be
a
de
novo
determination.
that
is
the
penalty
for
failure
to
object,
not
waiver
of
the
right
to
appeal.
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
no,
i
believe
the
judge
may
give...
in
fact,
if
the
court...
the
court
can
do
whatever
it
decides
to
do.
as
the
chief
justice
said
in
raddatz
and
weber,
the
magistrate
is
there
to
help
the
district
court
in
its
overburdened
case
law.
it
is
there
to
focus
the
issues.
the
court
can
reject
or
give
whatever
weight
it
wants
to
to
the
findings
of
the
magistrate.
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
no,
he
did
not--
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
--well,
i
will
agree
with
you
as
far
as
the
timetable
is
concerned.
there
was
nothing
submitted
after
the
magistrate's
report.
the
case
was
assigned
to
judge
conti's
docket.
i
filed
the
brief
with
judge
conti's
docket,
a
20-page
brief
that
fully
outlined
our
position
on
the
issues
of
law.
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
yes,
so
i
mean
when
i
file
it
it
goes
to
judge
conti.
judge
conti
fills
out
a
little
form
and
sends
it
to
the
magistrate.
the
magistrate
sends
it
back
to
judge
conti
with
the
report
recommendation.
i
would
indicate
for
the
record
in...
i
was
responding
to
justice
brennan
that
two
of
the
circuits
in
this
country
indicate
that
where
there
is
no
objections,
the
district
court
does
not
even
have
to
review
the
magistrate's
report.
there
is
nothing
more
for
the
district
court
to
do
in
the
case.
it
elevates
in
my
opinion
a
magistrate
to
a
judge.
i
would
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
i
thought
i
had,
your
honor,
in
the
article...
in
interpreting--
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
--well,
in
my
opinion
the
statute
says,
and
right
in
conjunction,
that
you
may
file...
the
magistrate
is
to
file
a
report
and
recommendations
for
final
decision
by
the
judge,
is
what
the
statute
says.
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
yes.
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
that's
correct.
i
recognize
that
four
of
the
circuits
have
held
that
a
waiver...
that
a
failure
to
object
waives
the
right
to
appeal
factual
findings
but
not
of
legal
conclusions.
as
justice
marshall
pointed
out
in
his
dissent
in
raddatz,
i
believe
that
justice
brandeis,
and
i
would
agree
with
him,
indicates
that
in
habeas
corpus
petition
you
are
entitled
to
review
of
the
facts
and
the
law
by
a
judge,
and
in
my
opinion
because
of
the
great
place
that
we
have
for
the
petition
of
habeas
corpus
in
our
society,
and
the
fact
that
we
are
talking
about
a
liberty
interest,
we
really
must
have
a
judge,
and
based
upon
the
statute,
which
holds
that
the
judge
is
the
ultimate
decisionmaker,
the
judge
must
decide
everything.
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
let
me
make
it
clear,
justice
marshall.
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
i
would
dearly
have
loved
to
file
the
objection
because
then
i
wouldn't
be
here
having
to
argue--
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
--yes.
yes.
in
my
opinion--
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
--that's
correct.
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
in
my
opinion,
yes,
based
upon
the
decisions--
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
--it
violates
due
process,
and
it
violates
article
3
by
practice
of
the
policy,
which
is
that
you
do
not
have...
the
district
court--
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
--amendment
five
and
fourteen,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
in
my
opinion,
a
magistrate...
not
having
a
judge--
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
--nothing.
to
be
honest--
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
--well,
like
i
said,
if
i
had
to
do
it
over
again,
i
would.
what
i
don't...
what
we...
where
the
law
stands
now
is
that
it
elevates
a
magistrate
to
something
higher
than
he
should
he
by
allowing
him
to
be
the
final
determination
of
the
issue.
the
issues
were
before
judge
conti.
he
recognized
that
and
he
decided
them.
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
i
said
if
i
had
to
do
it
over
again
i
would
file
them.
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
you
tell
me
to
file
them,
i
will
file
them.
i
will
file
them.
if
it
is
going
to
cure
the
problem
that
exists
and
the
reason
i
am
here,
i
will
file
them.
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
what
is
here
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
sixth
circuit's
determination
in
my
case
that
i
could
not
appeal
from
the
district
court
order
is
viable.
i
say
to
this
court
that
my
client
has
the
right
to
appeal
to
the
sixth
circuit
from
the
denial
by
the
district
court
judge
of
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus.
they
say
that
not...
failing
to
file
objections
waives
that
right,
and
i
say
that
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
you
have
to
understand,
justice
blackmun,
i
am
an
assault
practitioner.
up
until
friday,
when
the
circuit
court
judge
granted
a
stay
based
upon
your
latest
mitchell
versus
wyatt,
i
was
supposed
to
go
back
tomorrow
to
akron
to
start
a
month-long
jury
trial.
i
have
to
put
out
my
time
in
each
case
as
best
i
see
it.
in
this
case
i
had
filed
a
brief.
the
issues
were
before
the
district
court
judge.
i
felt
to
file
an
objection
would
have
been
just
simply
an
exercise
in
futility,
that
the
magistrate
considered
my
petition,
my
position
on
the
issus,
and
made
his
recommendation.
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
no,
it
was
simply
a
matter
where
i
didn't
feel
that
it
would
add
anything
to
the
controversy
before
judge
conti
by
filing
objections.
i
would
have
simply
refiled
my
brief
that
i
had
already
filed.
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
well,
i
think
it
is
different
because,
number
one,
congress
has
given
a
petitioner
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
the
right
to
appeal.
number
two,
congress--
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
--certainly.
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
well,
because
this
is
where
a
circuit
court
is
saying,
we
are
not
going
to
let
you
appeal
because
you
didn't
do
something
in
the
district
court,
namely,
file
objections.
number
one,
it
goes
to
statutory
construction
of
congress's
intent,
which
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
congress's
intent
is
for
the
district
court
to
be
the
ultimate
decisionmaker,
not
the
magistrate.
number
two,
the
penalty
for
failure
to
file
objections
is
quite
clear
from
congress's
intent
that
you
just
simply
do
not
get
a
de
novo
review.
there
is
no
express
policy
outlined
in
any
of
the
statutes
or
any
of
the
legislative
history
from
congress
that
they
expected
a
waiver
of
the
right
to
appeal.
i
would
say
to
this
court
that
where
you
have
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
and
the
right
to
appeal,
that
the
circuit
courts
cannot
limit
their
own
jurisdiction.
as
i
pointed
out
to
justice
stevens,
you
now
have
a
mishmash
in
the
different
circuits
where
in
some
circuits
you
can
appeal,
even
though
you
have
a
failure
to
file
objections,
and
in
other
circuits
you
can't,
and
i
think
that
is
untenable.
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
very
briefly.
first
of
all,
with
regard
to
justice
o'connor's
statements,
this,
the
sixth
circuit's
rule
is
not
a
procedural
default
rule.
there
is
only
one
circuit,
the
fourth
circuit,
that
would
cause
a
procedural
default.
the
attorney
general
may
be
trying
to
translate
it
into
that.
the
sixth
circuit
says,
under
a
supervisory
power,
you
have
to
file
objections
or
you
waive
your
right
to
appeal.
if
there
is
procedural
default,
there
will
be
an
order
of
the
court,
and
then
that
should
apply
presumably
around
the
country.
here
we
have,
if
you
are
going
to
talk
procedural
default,
in
four
the
circuits,
it
doesn't
matter,
and
in
two
of
the
circuits
it
does.
that
doesn't
make
any
sense.
justice
marshall
in
your
question.
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
in
my
opinion,
form
over
substance,
it
is
a
jurisdictional
rule.
you
cannot
appeal
because
you
didn't
file
objections.
it
is
not
procedural
default.
it
is
a
jurisdictional
rule.
it
is
a
jurisdictional
prerequisite,
is
the
way
the
sixth
circuit
put
it
in
one
of
its
unpublished
opinions.
and
in
talking
about
the
differences
between
the
magistrate
and
the
judge,
the
judge
has
the
case
from
the
beginning.
he
never
loses
jurisdiction
over
it.
it
doesn't
go
from
the
judge
to
the
magistrate,
and
that
somehow
they
are
two
different
people.
the
magistrate
is
working
under
the
judge.
the
judge
has
the
ultimate
determination.
the
brief
that
was
filed,
presented,
that
is
what
we
are
talking
about
in
this
case.
were
the
issues,
gut
reaction,
were
the
issues
before
the
trial
judge,
before
the
district
court?
yes,
they
were.
i
filed
a
memorandum,
extensive
memorandum
of
law.
this
case
has
been
argued
extensively
and
briefed
extensively
between...
and
this
is
the
sixth
court
i
have
been
to
for
relief
from
my
client.
now,
there
simply
cannot
be
a
waiver
construed
from
that.
as
i
said
before,
i
am
sorry
i
didn't
file
the
objections,
because
then
we
wouldn't
have
to
be
here,
out
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
the
issues
were
before
the
district
court,
and
the
district
court
made
the
de
novo
determination.
congress
has
given
us
the
right
to
appeal
from
a
denial
of
habeas
corpus,
and
the
sixth
circuit
in
their
role
is
trying
to
take
away
that
right,
which
i
don't
think
it
has
anything
to
do
with.
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
no,
it
was
never
addressed,
and
i
might
say
that
i
was
ill
on
the
day
of
oral
argument,
and
after
consultation
with
his
predecessor
from
the
attorney
general
has
agreed
that
we
could
waive
oral
argument.
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
i
didn't.
they
did.
there
was
never
any
reply
brief
filed.
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
no.
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
because
i
was
sick
on
that
day.
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
pardon?
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
i
filed
the
petition
then
for
rehearing
making
this
argument,
and
they
denied
it,
and
that
is
what
bring
us
to
this
court.
mr.
christopher
danahy
stanley
yes,
petition
for
rehearing
from
their
denial.
thank
you.
