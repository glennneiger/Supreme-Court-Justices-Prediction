mr.
robert
frederick
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
under
federal
maritime
law
damage
to
a
product
caused
by
a
design
defect
is
recoverable
in
tort.
the
product
in
this
case
is
the
main
propulsion
units
for
four
vessels.
both
the
district
court
and
the
third
circuit
en
banc
held
that
petitioners
do
not
have
federal
maritime
tort
claims.
now,
i
would
like
to
say
at
the
outset
that
although
the
case
is
within
the
court's
federal
maritime
jurisdiction,
essentially
in
our
view
it
is
about
a
non-functioning
product.
it
happens
to
arise
in
a
maritime
context
but
it
has
no
other
particular
maritime
flavor.
what
is
involved
here
is
an
interface
between
product
liability
law
and
contract
law,
particularly
exemplified
by
the
uniform
commercial
code.
and
what
we
are
doing
in
this
case
is
asking
this
court
to
follow
the
third
circuit
in
adopting
as
the
rule
the
majority
rule
in
land-based
courts.
this
type
of
case
has
been
handled--
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
--yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
exactly,
justice
white.
we
draw
no
distinction
between
strict
tort
liability
for
negligence
and
product
liability
law,
that's
correct.
this
is
exactly
the
type
of
tort
that
appellate
courts
in
both
the
states
and
federal
appellate
courts
have
dealt
with
many
times.
it
is
not
an
unusual
matter.
it
is
a
routine
matter
for
them,
and
what
they
have
held
in
the
overwhelming
majority
of
jurisdictions
is
that
recovery
is
denied
in
tort
where
a
product
itself
simply
fails
to
function
properly
but
is
not
unsafe.
in
these
circumstances,
they
leave
the
parties
to
their
contractual
remedies.
at
the
commencement
of
this
action
there
were
ten
plaintiffs.
in
addition
to
the
four
petitioners
there
sea
train
lines
which
is
a
large,
substantial
corporation,
its
wholly
owned
subsidiary,
sea
train
shipbuilding
which
built
the
four
vessels
involved
and
which
contracted
to
have
them
built
with
the
respondent,
four
wholly
owned
subsidiaries
of
sea
train
lines
which
were
the
original
owners
of
the
four
vessels
involved.
respondent
had
an
extensive
agreement
with
shipbuilding
for
the
design
and
manufacture
of
the
main
propulsion
units.
the
contract
contained
an
express
warranty.
it
disclaimed
any
warranties
other
than
the
warranty
expressly
set
forth.
it
provided
for
certain
remedies
such
as
repair
and
replacement.
it
expressly
excluded
liability
for
consequential
damages.
respondent
moved
for
summary
judgment
and
on
the
motion
asked
for
dismissal
of
the
breach
of
contract
and
the
breach
of
warranty
claims
on
the
basis
of
the
statute
of
limitations
and
various
contractual
provisions
which
limited
plaintiff's
remedy,
and
the
disclaimer
of
warranties
other
than
the
warranty
that
was
expressly
granted
under
the
contract.
the
claims,
sea
train
lines
shipbuilding
and
the
four
other
sea
train
subsidiaries
which
are
not
now
before
the
court,
all
were
dismissed
with
prejudice.
in
addition,
all
the
contract
claims
and
warranty
claims
were
dismissed
with
prejudice.
therefore,
we
had...
the
current
owners,
as
you
know,
are
not
before
the
court,
so
what
we
have
is
that
the
four
petitioners,
the
present
charterers
of
the
vessels,
are
the
only
remaining
plaintiffs
and
their
claims
are
exclusively
in
tort.
all
of
their
contract
and
warranty
claims
have
been
dismissed
on
the
merits
and
with
prejudice.
there
are
five
counts
in
the
complaint
that
this
court
is
asked
to
review.
the
first
four
counts
involve
a
particular
component
of
the
main
propulsion
units
for
the
guide
bucket
ring,
and
in
each
of
these
counts
which
relates
to
a
particular
vessel,
that
each
of
the
charterers
is
a
charterer
of
one
of
those
vessels,
the
complaint
is
that
there
was
a
malfunction
of
the
guide
bucket
ring.
on
the
fifth
count
one
of
the
owners
claims...
this
is
the
bay
ridge
which
is
the
ship
that's
involved
in
counts
four
and
five...
there
was
a
negligence
claim,
the
only
negligence
claim
before
you,
and
the
claim
is
that
the
respondent
failed
to
supervise
the
installation
of
the
stern
guardian
valve
which
was
installed
in
reverse.
and
i
would
just
point
out
as
an
aside,
the
record
reveals
that
the
bay
ridge
was
the
fourth
ship
built.
the
same
part
had
been
installed
properly
by
sea
train
shipbuilding
in
the
three
prior
ships.
in
any
event,
the
damage
was
confined
to
the
main
propulsion
units
themselves
in
all
of
these
counts,
but
consisted
only
of
internal
deterioration
and
breakdown.
there
was
no
damage
to
persons
or
other
property.
there
was
no
unreasonable
risk
of
harm
to
persons
or
other
property.
and
as
mr.
durkin
has
candidly
said,
what
is
sought
here
is
consequential
damage
in
the
form
of
nature
of
cost
and
replacement
and
lost
profits
from
down
time,
primarily.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
your
honor,
we
do
disagree
with
ingram
river
and
ingram
river
has
permitted
recovery
in
federal
maritime
law
for
negligence.
i
should
say,
your
honor,
that
the
judge
there
also
stated
by
fiat
that
he
disagreed
with
the
third
circuit.
ingram
river
followed
the
decision
of
the
third
circuit.
and
without
any
extensive
reasoning,
he
disagreed
with
them.
but
let
me--
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
--on
negligence,
your
honor,
i
think
that
there
is
no
other
case
in
point.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
strict
liability,
the
only
case
in
point
is
emerson
diesel
in
the
ninth
circuit,
and
your
honor,
i
think
neither
of
those
cases
are
ones
with
which
we
would
agree.
and
i
would
point
out
that
neither
one
involves
an
analysis
of
the--
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
--they
don't
agree
with
us.
that's
absolutely
so.
your
honor,
i
could...
i
don't
want
to
go
off
onto
either
ingram
river
or
emerson
unless
your
honor
wants
me
to
go
off
onto
them.
in
the
presentation
what
i
intend
to
do
is
raise
the
arguments
that
i
think
they
themselves
in
their
opinions
don't
adequately
state,
and
we
believe
we
have
satisfactorily
distinguished
them
in
our
briefs.
your
honor,
the
construction
of
the
stuyvesant
which
is
the
stuyvesant
ship
and
its
events
are
the
seminal
events
in
this
case.
the
stuyvesant's
construction
was
completed
in
1977,
and
i
should
add
that
the
construction
contract
which
i
described
before
is
a
1970
contract.
in
december
'77,
as
the
stuyvesant
was
entering
the
port
of
valdiz
in
alaska,
it
had
a
steam
escape
problem
of
some
dimension.
the
problem
was
solved
in
the
port.
there
is
no
allegation
that
that
steam
escape
problem
led
to
any
damage
of
any
kind.
the
stuyvesant
then
proceeded
to
load
the
oil
on
the
ship
and
proceeded
two
days
later
on
its
voyage
down
to
the
panama
canal.
on
that
voyage
it
experienced
a
problem
with
its
turbine,
and
i
want
to
say
that
i
heard
in
the
opening
argument
a
reference
to
a
ship
without
power
being
in
trouble.
the
stuyvesant
was
not
without
power.
the
stuyvesant
operated
at
a
substantial
amount
of
power
at
all
times.
what
occurred
with
the
stuyvesant
was
that
it
was
not
able
to
attain
its
normal
speed.
the
record
shows
that
the
guide
bucket
ring
and
the
main
propulsion
units
did
not
function
the
way
they
were
supposed
to
function.
there
was
a
malfunction
of
the
main
propulsion
unit.
but
even
as
it
is
suggested
on
the
record
that
the
stuyvesant
encountered
high
seas
and
some
drifting
on
this
voyage
down
the
west
coast
off
the
panama
canal
zone,
nevertheless
it
made
sufficient
headway
even
in
a
storm
that
is
described
by
petitioners
as
having
some
severity,
it
had
enough
power
to
weather
the
storm
and
it
made
the
voyage
successfully
and
in
fact
off-loaded
its
oil
at
the
panama
canal
zone
and
then
proceeded
back
without
incident
to
the
port
of
san
francisco.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
test
really
is
one
of
risk.
i
agree
with
the
test
enunciated
by
the
third
circuit,
and
as
i
understand
the
majority
of
land-based
rule,
one
could
have
a
risk
without
the
harm
occurring.
it
is
very
difficult,
i
think
in
most
instances,
to
imagine
liability
without
harm
actually
occurring
but
i
suppose
it
would
be
conceivable
under
some
circumstances
that
risk
alone
might
give
rise
to
liability.
but,
your
honor,
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
a
practical
matter
have
determined
that
there's
no
triable
issue
as
to
risk.
they
have
so
held.
so,
i
really
don't
think
that
that
is
left
in
this
case.
when
the
stuyvesant
reached
san
francisco
an
inspection
of
the
engine
revealed
damage
to
this
guide
bucket
ring,
and
it
was
then
replaced
as
we
know
with
a
part
from
the
brooklyn.
that
part
did
not
perform
terribly
well.
the
stuyvesant
resumed
operation
with
it.
there
was
no
further
malfunction,
but
ultimately
the
guide
bucket
ring
was
replaced
with
a
newly
designed
guide
bucket
ring.
that
was
the
story
of
the
stuyvesant,
and
really
it
is
the
only
ship
which
involves
much
of
any
incident
at
all.
as
far
as
the
counts
two
and
three
of
the
complaint
at
concern,
they
involve
the
ships
which
we
call
the
brooklyn
and
the
williamsburg.
both
of
these
ships
have
been
constructed
prior
to
the
stuyvesant.
they
were
older
ships.
they
had
already
seen
substantial
service
at
the
time
that
the
stuyvesant
encountered
the
high
seas
leaving
the
port
of
valdez.
these
ships
never
had
a
malfunction.
they
never
had
any
problem
with
their
engines.
after
the
stuyvesant
incident,
and
only
because
of
the
stuyvesant
incident,
both
of
these
ships
had
their
engines
opened
in
port
and
there
it
was
discovered
that
there
was
a
low
level
of
deterioration
which
one
could
contend
showed
that
they
had
the
same
problem
as
the
stuyvesant
guide
bucket
ring.
those
guide
bucket
rings
were
replaced
with
newly
designed
guide
bucket
rings,
ultimately.
simply
nothing
happened.
there
was
simply
repair
and
replacement
of
the
guide
bucket
rings.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
at
some
expense.
but,
your
honor,
let
me
be
quick
to
say
that
in
our
view
the
case
is
not
a
case
of
a
question
of
damage.
it's
a
question
whether
there's
a
valid
tort
claim.
the
fourth
count,
your
honor,
involves
the
bay
ridge
and
again
involved
an
alleged
defect
in
the
guide
bucket
ring.
may
it
please
the
court,
the
bay
ridge
never
left
port
with
a
defective
guide
bucket
ring.
it
was
the
last
ship
built.
since
it
was
built
after
the
stuyvesant
incident,
all
that
happened
was
that
by
the
time
it
left
port
it
had
the
newly
designed
guide
bucket
ring.
nothing
ever
happened
on
the
stuyvesant.
there
is
simply
no
allegation
concerning
the
stuyvesant
that
could
give
rise
to
liability,
and
that
also
was
so
held
by
both
the
circuit
court.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
excuse
me,
the
bay
ridge.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
no,
your
honor.
i
have
not
been
to
sea,
i
would
suppose,
any
more
than
your
honor
may
have
been.
the
guide
bucket
rings,
as
i
understand
it,
are
not
related
to
the
fifth
count.
the
fifth
count
is
in
a
stern
guardian
valve
which
is
separate
and
distinct,
but
part
of
the
main
propulsion
unit.
they're
both
parts
of
a
main
propulsion
unit.
no
one
has
claimed
that
the
guide
bucket
ring...
excuse
me,
that
the
stern
guardian
valve
was
defective
in
any
way.
it
was
simply
installed
in
reverse.
i
want
to
make
one
further
point,
if
i
may,
and
that
is
that
as
far
as
we're
concerned
the
richmond,
which
is
the
petitioner
involved
on
the
fourth
count,
simply
has
no
standing.
the
record
discloses
that
the
guide
bucket
ring
problem
occurred
in
the
past
during
1978
and
the
richmond
became
the
charterer
of
the
vessel
on
march
15,
1979.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
yes.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
so
under
the
majority
land-based
rule
which
was
applied
by
the
third
circuit,
and
that
is
that
once
again
the
damage
that
we're
talking
about,
the
cause
of
the
negligent,
or
the
alleged
negligent
installation,
and
in
our
case
supervision
of
the
stern
guardian
valve
involved
deterioration
and
breakdown
of
that
valve,
of
that
part,
same
as
the
guide
bucket
ring
that
deteriorated.
there's
no
one
tort
incident.
there's
no
collision.
and
in
fact,
as
part
of
the
record
there's
the
deposition
of
the
former
machinery
superintendent
of
the--
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
--your
honor,
as
i
understand
the
majority
rule,
and
i
think
it's
really
quite
clear
on
this
point,
it
isn't
the
possibility
that
the
damage
could
occur.
it
is
the
risk
and
the
high
potential
of
risk.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
your
honor,
but
that's
not
the
risk
that
the
rule
is
speaking
of.
the
rule
is
seeking
to
demarcate
between
contract
and
tort
law
and
it
doesn't
focus
on
the
damage.
it's
the
risk...
what
the
rule
seeks
to
demarcate
is
a
high
probability
of
a
safety
risk,
not
that
there
will
be
damage
and
losses,
but
that
persons
or
property
other
than
the
product
itself
will
be
damaged.
that's
the
risk
that
is
talked
about.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
your
honor,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
safety
implication
to
the
fifth
count.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
the
reason,
your
honor,
would
be
that
that
is
in
fact
the
majority
rule
on
land.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
your
honor,
i
think
it
does.
i
think
there
are
very
substantial
reasons
to
commend
it.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
and
i
think
it's
the
reason
for
the
majority
rule...
i
think
the
majority
rule
is
well
based.
there's
a
reason
for
distinguishing
between
the
contract
interest
to
be
protected
and
the
tort
interest
to
be
protected.
the
reason,
i
think,
your
honor
is...
and
i
must
say
this,
is
because
the
contract
expressly
protects
against
economic
expectations
and
damaged
economic
expectations.
the
tort
is
a
rule
that
is
implied
in
law.
the
law
imposes
it
on
people
to
protect
against
safety
defects.
but
if
there's
no
safety
defect,
your
honor,
what
we
say
is
that
this
area
should
be
left
to
the
parties
in
a
private
bargaining
context.
and,
your
honor,
this
case
exemplifies
it
in
many
ways.
to
begin
with,
we
were
party
to
an
extensive
contract
and
there's
no
doubt
that
all
the
parties
in
this
case
are
substantial
commercial
entities
that
can
protect
themselves
and
bargain
for
the
types
of
terms
and
conditions
they
thought
were
appropriate.
in
this
case
we
were
subject
to
such
a
bargain,
and
we
made
such
an
agreement
back
in
1970.
all
those
contract
claims,
all
those
warranty
claims,
have
now
been
dismissed
without
prejudice.
we
are
being
asked
to
function
almost
as
a--
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
--with
prejudice.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
we
had
moved
on
that
ground.
what
actually
happened
procedurally
is
that
after
the
motion
had
been
made
on
that
ground,
and
on
other
grounds
such
as
contractual
grounds
that
the
warranties
expired,
what
occurred
was
that
the
petitioners
served
their
second
amended
complaint.
it
did
not
contain
those
claims.
they
themselves
elected
to
go
forward
on
the
complaint
that
is
now
before
the
court,
which
is
exclusively
a
tort
claim,
and
at
that
time
the
court
entered
the
order
dismissing
all
contract
and
warranty
claims
as
matter
of
law,
with
prejudice.
so
that,
what
we
say
is
that
contract
properly
protects
the
expectations
of
the
party.
tort
properly
protects
against
the
risk
of
harm
that
might
be
caused
by
a
product.
and
in
this
particular
case
there
is
no
risk
of
harm.
what
we're
talking
about
is
the
contractual
area.
and
i
want
to
make
one
further
point,
which
i
think
justice
stevens
was
asking
the
counsel
for
the
petitioners
about.
the
charterers
had
an
opportunity
to
protect
themselves
by
contract
and
they
entered
into
an
extensive
charter
agreement,
one
charter
for
each
of
them,
which
is
contained
in
the
record
and
that
charter
allocates
the
very
risks
that
we're
talking
about
here.
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
requires,
if
it
is
true
that
under
the
charter
the
charterers
are
required
to
make
the
repairs
to
the
vessel,
but
that
was
a
bargained
for
matter.
it
was
a
matter
that
was
within
the
realm
of
contract.
so,
there
can't
be
any
credible
claim
but
that
the
exact
claim
that
is
made
here
could
not
have
been
protected
as
a
matter
of
contract
right.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
there's
anything
in
the
record
about
it.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
well,
i'm
glad
your
honor
asked
that
question.
i
thought
i
had
responded.
there
was
not
a
total
power
failure,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
i
don't
think
so,
with
the
immediacy,
your
honor,
that
tort
law
implicates.
there
are
cases
involving...
the
most
innocuous
type
of
product
can
be
dangerous
in
some
contexts,
and
the
courts
don't
permit
plaintiffs
by
conjuring
up
what
might
happen
to
make
a
claim
in
tort.
and
there
are
a
substantial
number
of
cases
which
we
cite
in
our
briefs
involving
engines,
including
airplane
engines,
and
the
courts
have
found
that
unless
there's
some
sort
of
immediate,
very
very
concrete
and
severe
risk
of
harm,
that
you're
not
stating
a
case--
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
--your
honor,
if
there's
a
tort
claim,
we're
not
arguing
against
it.
we're
not
claiming
that
the
type
of
damages
that
are
sought
here
could
not
be
claimed
in
a
tort
action.
what
we
say
is
that
the
petitioners
don't
have
a
tort
claim.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
yes.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
your
honor,
that
would
be
for
a
trial.
the
discovery
in
the
case--
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
--as
a
kind
of
damage
in
tort?
i
doubt
that
even
then,
it
could
be
recovered.
some
of
them
seem
to
me
not
to
follow
up
with
tort
theory
at
all.
they
seem
to
me
to
follow
from
breach
of
contract.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
it
would
be
extremely
difficult,
it
seems
to
me,
to
recover
it
in
court,
certainly
debatable.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
your
honor
is
quite
right.
i
would
not
concede
the
recoverability
of
any
of
the
damages
specified,
just
as
a
matter
of
tort
law.
but
i
do
want
to
reiterate
that
in
our
view--
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
i
did
want
to
mention
one
fact
as
well
that
i
think
is
very
important,
about
the
tort
aspect
and
the
incorporation
into
admiralty
of
the
majority
rule.
the
majority
rule,
both
in
terms
of
strict
tort
and
negligence,
was
incorporated
into
admiralty
in
a
series
of
cases
where
the
reason
they
were
incorporated
in
was
that
the
federal
court,
sitting
as
maritime
courts,
felt
they
were
the
better
rule.
that's
the
reason
they
were
incorporated
into
admiralty
to
begin
with,
so
it
seems
to
us
only
logical
that
starting
with
that
premise,
if
those
rules
were
incorporated
in
because
they
were
in
fact
the
widespread
rules
in
the
state,
the
version
that
is
the
majority
rule
ought
to
be
incorporated
along
with
them
and
not
a
disfavored
rule.
on
that,
i
want
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
leading
case
against
us
in
the
state
courts
has
traditionally
been
the
santor
case
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey.
that
has
been
the
most
aggressive
case
asserting
that
there
can
be
liability
when
a
product
just
is
defective
in
quality.
it
involved,
in
fact,
a
defective
rug
that
didn't
harm
anybody.
it
had
waves
in
it
that
shouldn't
have
been
in
the
rug.
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey--
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
--santor,
s-a-n-t-o-r.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
it's
a
fairly
ancient
case.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
1965.
but
may
i
say,
your
honor,
that
in
a
decision
this
year,
not
in
'86
but
in
'85,
a
full
20
years
later,
the
court
has
undercut
santor
explicitly
in
spring
motors
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
and
has
said
that
at
least
as
between
large
commercial
entities,
claims
involving
defective
products
which
don't
present
a
safety
problem,
they're
quality
defects,
should
not
give
rise
to
tort
liability.
and
the
court
is
very
explicit
in
its
language,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
say
very
succinctly
in
a
quote
that
i
think
summarizes
our
position
very
well,
they
say,
quote,
"underlying
the
ucc
policy
is
the
principle,
the
parties
should
be
free
to
make
contracts
of
their
choice
including
contracts
disclaiming
liability
for
breach
of
warranty.
"
"once
they
reach
such
an
agreement,
society
has
an
interest
in
seeing
that
the
agreement
is
fulfilled.
"
"consequently
the
ucc
is
the
more
appropriate
vehicle
for
resolving
commercial
disputes
arising
out
of
business
transactions
between
persons
in
a
distributive
chain.
"
that's
precisely
what
we
have
here.
we
have
the
distributive
chain.
there
are
contracts
between
every
link
in
the
chain.
everybody
in
the
chain
had
an
opportunity
to
bargain.
we
say
it
would
be
unfair
for
us
as
a
matter
of
tort
law.
the
contract
that
we
entered
into
was
a
1970
contract.
quite
a
few
many
years
later,
to
be
held
to
a
standard
of
guaranteeing
that
product
when
there's
no
safety
implication
but
the
argument
is
that
the
product
was
qualitatively
defective.
indeed,
i
would
say
that
if
the
majority
land-based
rule
isn't
used,
it's
difficult
to
see
where
the
function
of
tort
law,
or
i
should
say
where
the
function
of
contract
law
would
really
function
in
this
area.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
tantamount
to
saying
that
the
product
manufacturer
is
a
guarantor
of
this
product.
there's
another
point
that
i
want
to
make
that
i
think
also
supports
the
view
that
the
majority
land-based
rule
should
be
used,
and
that
is
that
in
fact
on
the
contract
side,
the
uniform
commercial
code
which
is
what
we're
talking
about
predominantly
on
the
contract
side,
has
been
adopted
in
49
of
the
states
and
even
in
the
50th
it
has
been
adopted
in
rather
substantial
part.
this
is
an
opportunity
for
the
court
to
determine
the
federal
maritime
law
would
be
uniform
with
land-based
law
and
i
would
point
out
that
there's
basically
no
difference
between
ship
engines
and
car
engines.
in
many
cases
you
have
the
same
manufacturers
of
both
kinds
of
engines.
in
many
cases
the
same
engines
are
used
in
both
applications.
the
third
circuit
itself
said,
and
i'm
quoting
them
on
this
point,
"the
charterers
have
not
offered
and
we
do
not
discern
any
persuasive
difference
between
an
action
which
seeks
recovery
for
a
defective
ship
engine
and
an
action
which
seeks
recovery
for
a
defective
car
engine.
"
"in
both
cases
the
law
seeks
to
leave
the
parties
to
their
bargain,
while
at
the
same
time
protecting
consumers
of
both
ships
and
cars
from
hazardous
defects
in
the
engines.
"
and
we
believe
that
there
is
no
persuasive
rule
for
a
different
rule
on
land
and
sea.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
your
honor,
i
think
that
every
case
of
a
claim
of
tort,
one
is
going
to
have
to
look
at
the
facts
very
closely.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
your
honor,
i
think
it
depends
upon
what...
first
of
all,
let
me
immediately
say
that
that's
not
our
case.
i
can't
say
too
frequently
that
the
power...
all
that
happened
in
our
case,
and
with
only
one
of
the
four
engines,
we're
talking
about,
is
that
it
failed
to
attain
full
power.
it
attained
very
substantial
power
because
it
powered
right
through
whatever
storm
it
reached.
the
second
question
that
your
honor
raises,
which
i
regard
as
a
hypothetical
question,
as
to
whether
or
not
a
ship
bereft
of
any
power
on
the
seas,
one
would
wish
to
know
what
seas
they
were
in,
whether
or
not
there
were
tugs
available
to
them.
yes,
there
is
some
risk.
the
question
would
have
to
rely
upon
the
facts
as
to
exactly
how
great
a
risk
there
is.
but
your
point
you're
making
is,
that
is
not
this
case?
not
this
case,
and
it
has
been
so
determined
not
to
be
this
case,
your
honor,
by
the
third
circuit
en
banc
and
the
district
court.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
i
would
say
the
same
with
airplane
engines.
i
didn't
mean
to
confine
the
engines
to
land
and
sea.
i
think
in
all
three
instances,
your
honor...
and
i
think
it
has
the
desirable
effect
that
the
manufacturers
have
some
idea
what
their
standard
of
liability
is,
their
purchasers
know,
and
that
whole
area
is
left
to
contractual
bargaining,
particularly
as
between
large
commercial
entities.
it
really
seems
to
me
that
this
is
a
matter
that's
better
left
to
the
area
of
contract
law
rather
than
tort
law.
mr.
robert
frederick
smith
there's
one
further
consideration
that
i
wanted
to
state,
and
that's
frequently
as
a
basis,
the
product
tort
liability
law,
the
courts
have
said
the
manufacturer
has
a
greater
ability
to
distribute
the
risk.
i
think
once
again
that
as
between
large
commercial
entities,
that
rationale
doesn't
really
operate.
i
think
as
between
large
commercial
entities,
they
both
have
the
ability
to
insure
or
to
otherwise
spread
the
risk
to
their
customers
in
the
form
of
higher
prices.
that
rationale
simply
makes
no
sense
here.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
would
suggest
that
in
many
cases,
actually
the
large
commercial
user
of
the
product
is
in
better
shape
to
distribute
the
risk
to
the
manufacturer.
it
knows
the
particular
use
to
which
the
product
will
be
used.
it
knows
the
particular
voyages
that
will
be
undertaken.
it
knows
the
particular
hazards
to
which
it
intends
to
subject
the
product.
so,
i
think
that
that
rationale
doesn't
hold
up
here
at
all.
we
urge
the
court
to
adopt
the
majority
land-based
rule.
we
believe
that
at
least
as
between
large
commercial
entities,
the
user
of
a
defective
product
who
is
complaining
about
the
quality
of
the
product
below,
should
be
left
to
his
complaint
in
contract
law
and
not
tort
law.
commercial
entities
similarly
situated
should
be
left
to
their
contractual
remedies,
those
they
can
bargain
for
in
the
commercial
context.
we
say
that
unless
safety
is
implicated,
the
tort
principle
simply
shouldn't
interfere
with
their
contract.
we
ask
the
court
to
confirm
that
petitioners
do
not
have
federal
maritime
court
claims,
and
we
ask
that
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit,
dismissing
this
action,
be
affirmed.
