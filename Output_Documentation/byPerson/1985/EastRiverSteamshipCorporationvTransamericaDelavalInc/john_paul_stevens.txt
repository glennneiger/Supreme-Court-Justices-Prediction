mr.
durkin,
could
i
interrupt
you.
i
have
sort
of
the
same
problem
justice
rehnquist
has.
wasn't
there
a
general
contractor,
in
effect,
involved?
they
didn't
deal
directly
with
your
client
and
delaval,
did
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
client
is
the
charterer,
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
ordered
a
ship
built
by
somebody.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
did
the
plaintiff
get
involved,
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
the
two
million
dollars
you're
talking
about
is
repair
cost,
not
original
cost?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
you're
saying
you're
a
subsequent
owner
of
a
ship
that
was
defectively
constructed
and
you
say,
just
like
i
buy
a
used
car
that
somebody,
when
they
originally
built
it,
built
it
improperly,
i
can
sue
the
person
who
made
the
original
mistake?
justice
john
paul
stevens
used
car.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
your
only
contractual
relationship
was
with
your
immediate
predecessor
in
title?
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
with
the
shipyard?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
owner's
position,
the
owner
would
have
had
a
contractual
relationship,
not
with
delaval
but
with
the
builder
of
the
boat?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
boat
or
the
ship,
pardon
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
you
just
clarify
one
other
thing
for
me?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
charterer
in
this
situation
get
a
contractual
protection
from
anybody
that
the
ship
is
seaworthy?
does
anybody
give
any...
when
you
say,
take
it
in
as
is
condition,
they
just
take
the
entire
risk
that
something's
wrong
with
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
didn't
mean...
i'm
trying
to
stay
away
from
legal
obligation,
just
contractual.
you
mean
the...
your
client
in
a
situation
like
this
enters
into
a
transaction
like
this
with
no
contractual
protection
against
the
danger
that
the
ship
may
be
full
of
holes
or
something
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
relies
just
on
the
visual
inspection
of
the
ship
and
so
forth,
and
then
takes
the
risk?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
i
mean,
he
doesn't
have
any
contractual
protection,
that's
what
i'm
asking,
so
he
has
to
insure
against
this
risk,
is
the
only
thing
he
can
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
something
go
wrong
with
the
turbine,
might
be
one
risk.
it's
what
happened,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
it's
not
totally
unforeseeable
there'd
be
something
wrong
with
the
product?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
they
acquire
the
right
to
assert
any
warranty
claims
that
their
predecessors
in
title
could
have--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
one
other
question.
i
understand
your
argument
about,
the
contractual
remedy
should
cover
both
the
negligence
and
strict
liability
claims,
but
basically
it's
the
same
argument.
but
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
understand
fully
your
answer
to
your
opponent's
argument
that
the
power
failure
on
an
ocean-going
vessel,
almost
by
hypothesis,
could
create
a
serious
risk
of
harm
or
at
least
enough
to
withstand
summary
judgment
motion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
that,
but
was
not
there
a
risk...
if
we're
talking
about
risk
rather
than
actual
events,
would
not
a
manufacturing
defect
of
this
kind
create
a
substantial
risk
of
a
total
power
failure
which
in
turn
might
create
the
risk
of
a
navigation
hazard?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
say
we
apply
the
same
rule
for
ship
engines
and
automobile
and
truck
engines.
what
about
airplane
engines?
