justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
ordinarily
a
contract
measure
of
damages.
isn't
that
ordinarily
a
contract
measure
of
damages,
what
you
just
talked
about?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
just
described
something
in
terms
of
a
failure
to
perform,
i
thought,
and
that
is
ordinarily
a
contract
concept.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you've
stated
it
three
times
but
you
haven't
made
it
any
clearer
to
me.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
was
it
the
requirement
on
the
manufacturer?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
there
was
a
requirement
on
the
manufacturer
to
manufacture
in
a
particular
way.
what's
the
source
of
that
requirement?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
then,
the
admiralty
borrows
new
jersey
law
in
that
respect?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
why
did
you
mention
new
jersey
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
certainly,
this
case
was
tried
in
admiralty,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
if
there
is
a
requirement
on
the
manufacturer
to
make
the
turbine
this
particular
way,
as
you
say
it
is,
and
you
say
the
source
of
the
requirement
is
from
the
new
jersey
law,
admiralty
must
be
borrowing
new
jersey
law,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
smith,
is
the
test
there
one
of
risk
or
one
of
whether
the
risk
materialized?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
why
should
you
import
this
product
liability
type
of
limitation
into
what
justice
o'connor
seems
to
me
to
rightly
describe
just
as
a
straight
negligence
count?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does
it
have
anything
better
to
commend
it?
