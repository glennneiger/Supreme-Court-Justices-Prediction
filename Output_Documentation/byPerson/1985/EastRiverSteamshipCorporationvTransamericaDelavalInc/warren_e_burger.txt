what
about
the
fact
a
big,
over
the
road
truck
or
any
other
land
vehicle
has
a
defective
engine
and
it
just
stops,
no
great
risk
except
the
driver
or
the
people
on
it
might
get
cold,
but
when
you
have
a
vessel
at
sea
and
the
moving
power
stops,
aren't
you
exposed
to
a
great
deal
of
different
and
greater
hazard,
the
ship
that's
wallowing
around
with
no
steerage?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
look
at
those
facts.
the
ship
is
out
at
sea
and
the
engine
stops
and
of
course--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
durkin?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
