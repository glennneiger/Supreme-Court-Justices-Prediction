mr.
thomas
e.
durkin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
all
of
the
circuits
that
have
addressed
most
of
the
questions
that
are
here
under
consideration
indicate
agreement
on
certain
aspects.
one,
all
circuits
agree
that
admiralty
law
is
applicable
to
this
type
of
claim.
all
of
the
circuits
also
indicate
their
full
agreement
that
strict
liability
in
torts
is
applicable
in
admiralty
cases.
four
of
the
five
responding
circuits
had
enunciated
a
rule
relative
to
the
damages
that
are
pleadable
and
collectible
in
a
strict
liability
and
tort
claimed
under
admiralty.
one
circuit
assumes
a
different
posture.
before
i
address
specifically
the
question
involved,
i
would
most
respectfully
invite
the
court's
attention
to
two
or
three,
quote,
"facts"
as
set
forth
in
the
opinion
here
under
consideration
and
of
the
third
circuit
which
do
not
seem
to
comport
with
the
record
upon
which
those
particular
findings
were
made.
and
the
most
grievous,
if
i
may
refer
to
it
as
such,
is
the
references
in
the
opinion
written
by
judge
hunter
that
the
one
ship
involved,
the
bay
ridge,
never
left
the
dock.
indulge
me
for
a
moment
to
succinctly
outline
the
differing
factors
of
the
first
of
the
three
ships
and
the
bay
ridge.
the
episode
all
started
by
the
problem
that
was
encountered
by
the
stuyvesant.
at
the
time
the
stuyvesant
encountered
that
particular
problem,
there
was
then
under
construction
at
a
shipyard
in
brooklyn
the
bay
ridge.
the
shipyard
that
constructed
the
four
of
these
supertankers
was
the
same.
the
supplier
of
the
turbines
that
were
installed
in
these
particular
supertankers
was
also
the
same.
now,
at
the
time
the
stuyvesant
experienced
its
problem,
there
was
a
decision
made...
the
basis
for
the
decision
i
will
review
very
shortly...
that
the
circumstances
required
an
exchange
of
the
ring
that
was
then
at
the
bay
ridge,
and
have
it
transported
for
installation
into
the
stuyvesant.
thereafter,
as
far
as
the
bay
ridge
was
concerned,
there
was
manufactured
a
ring
different
than
the
original
four
rings,
which
newly
constructed
ring
incorporated
the
recommendations
of
these
plaintiffs'
experts,
and
that
ring
was
thereafter
installed
in
that
bay
ridge.
it
is
that
plaintiff's
position
relative
to
the
bay
ridge
that
at
the
time
that
bay
ridge
left
that
shipyard
and
while
it
was
en
route
to
its
destination,
the
problem
encountered
by
that
ship
had
absolutely
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
manufacture
of
the
ring.
what
happened,
at
the
time
that
properly
constructed
ring
was
being
installed
in
that
turbine
of
the
bay
ridge,
some
of
the
appurtenances
that
had
to
be
installed
in
order
for
that
turbine
to
be
functional,
more
specifically
a
guardian
stern
bow,
was
installed
in
reverse
and
this
installation
occurred
under
the
supervision
of
the
representatives
of
delaval.
as
a
result
of
that
valve
being
installed
in
reverse,
improper
steam
got
into
that
turbine
and
it
was
the
improper
steam
that
got
into
that
turbine
that
caused
the
disintegration
of
the
components
of
that
particular
turbine.
at
the
time
of
the
episode
with
the
bay
ridge,
when
that
ring
was
taken
out
it
was
thereafter,
it
being
the
first
ring,
it
was
thereafter
installed
in
the
stuyvesant.
now,
it
may
be
appropriate
now
to
note
that
the
opinion
of
the
third
circuit,
the
third
circuit
made
mention
on
page
7,
part
of
it
is
carried
over
to
page
8
of
its
opinion,
that
the
plaintiff
did
not
seek
to
order
a
new
part
from
delaval
but
in
lieu
of
doing
that,
obtained
the
ring
out
of
the
bay
ridge.
mr.
thomas
e.
durkin,
jr.
well,
on
the
point
that
i
just
mentioned,
i
thought
if
the
fact
would
be
a
fact
obtainable
from
the
record
and
the
specific
circumstance,
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion...
the
court
of
appeals
expressly
states
that
it's
making
its
findings
on
a
hypothesis
that
that
ship
never
left
the
pier.
that
ship
not
only
left
the
pier,
but
that
ship
was
in
the
middle
of
the
ocean
when
it
encountered
this
difficulty,
when
it
was
in
total
distress.
and
that
was
never
a
circumstance--
mr.
thomas
e.
durkin,
jr.
--i
am,
sir,
but
there
are
two.
that
one
has
to
do
with
the
question
of
the
negligence,
and
the
other
has
to
do
with
the
specific
circumstance
of
the
applicability
of
strict
liability
and
tort.
now,
what
is
suggested
by
the
question
that's
submitted,
factually
outlined,
is
this.
may
the
manufacturer
of
a
turbine,
which
turbine
is
to
be
the
power
unit
of
a
225,000
<dwt>
[=
dwt]
ton
tanker,
represent
to
the
shipyard
that
if
that
manufacturer
can
supply
a
turbine
to
that
particular
ship
so
as
for
that
ship
to
acquire
propulsion,
and
thereafter
when
that
ship
is
completed
and
that
ship
is
sold
and
that
ship
is
chartered,
should
that
charterer
as
was
the
fact
here,
be
responsible
without
redress
to
collect
in
damage
approximately
two
million
dollars
paid
by
these
plaintiffs
to
this
defendant,
delaval,
for
that
defendant
then
to
do
that
which
that
defendant
was
obligated
to
at
the
time
of
the
particular
initial
construction.
differently
stated,
the
split
in
the
circuits
seems
to
suggest,
according
to
the
third
circuit,
this
plaintiff
may
not
collect
this
type
of
damage
in
strict
liability
in
tort,
even
though
the
damages
that
were
caused
to
this
particular
charterer
are
without
question
damages
caused
by
the
negligent
or
improper
construction
of
the
turbine
at
the
time
of
original
construction.
there
has
been
much
suggested
in
all
opinions
relative
to
this
phrase,
"economic
loss".
the
damages
that
were
sought
to
be
collected
here
were
basically
four
in
nature.
one,
those
monies
paid
by
these
plaintiffs
directly
to
delaval,
an
amount
just
the
right
side
of
two
million
dollars,
which
monies
were
paid
to
delaval
to
do
to
those
rings
that
which
the
law
imposed
upon
delaval
to
do
in
the
first
place.
two--
mr.
thomas
e.
durkin,
jr.
--no,
sir.
no,
sir.
there
is
nothing
here
involving
quota
contract.
this
charterer--
mr.
thomas
e.
durkin,
jr.
--let
me
state
it
again,
sir.
that
which
this
plaintiff
paid
to
that
manufacturer,
the
amount
i
refer
to,
roughly
two
million
dollars,
was
for
that
manufacturer
to
give
to
that
charterer
a
turbine
which
that
manufacturer,
not
by
means
of
contract
but
by
operation
of
law
was
required
to
supply
in
the
first
place.
mr.
thomas
e.
durkin,
jr.
at
the
time
that
the
turbine
was
originally
manufactured,
extra
to
any
contract
term,
the
requirement
of
that
manufacturer
was
to
manufacture
a
product--
mr.
thomas
e.
durkin,
jr.
--sir,
i'm
sorry?
mr.
thomas
e.
durkin,
jr.
well,
the
particular
turbine
was
manufactured
in
new
jersey
and
the
law
of
new
jersey
imposes
an
obligation
upon
a
manufacturer
of
a
particular
commodity,
which
commodity
is
thereafter
to
be
introduced
into
the
general
course
of
commerce,
a
conduct
to
make
that
particular
turbine
reasonably
safe.
mr.
thomas
e.
durkin,
jr.
well,
i
won't
say,
sir,
that
they
borrow
the
new
jersey
law.
mr.
thomas
e.
durkin,
jr.
only,
sir,
because
you
asked
me
a
specific
question.
the
turbine
was
manufactured
in
new
jersey.
mr.
thomas
e.
durkin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
durkin,
jr.
well,
not
only
new
jersey
law.
admiralty
has
invoked
the
laws
of
many
land-based
authorities
on
the
same
question,
not
solely
limited
to
new
jersey.
new
jersey
law
comports
with
many
illustrations
of
the
federal
court
in
exercising
admiralty
jurisdiction,
adopting
in
certain
phases
of
admiralty
law,
law
that's
followed
by
certain
state
jurisdictions.
now,
when
this
plaintiff,
this
charterer,
experienced
the
circumstance
that
it
experienced,
if
that
charterer
was
required
to
expend
monies,
actual
dollar
expenditures,
two
million
of
which
went
to
the
defendant
for
the
work
that
was
required
to
be
done
by
the
defendant
on
the
particular
turbines
involved,
in
addition--
mr.
thomas
e.
durkin,
jr.
--when
you
say
"they",
sir,
i'm
not
following.
mr.
thomas
e.
durkin,
jr.
my
client,
the
charterer--
mr.
thomas
e.
durkin,
jr.
--no,
sir.
no,
sir.
the
entity
that
ordered
the
ship
under
contract
with
the
shipyard
was
an
entity
totally
disassociated
from
the
plaintiff
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
e.
durkin,
jr.
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
thereafter,
after
a
sequence
of
transfers
of
title,
my
clients
chartered,
bareboat
chartered
that
vessel
from
the
then
owner.
and
under
the
term
of
the
charter
and
during
the
term
of
the
charter,
anything
that
happens
to
that
ship,
i,
the
charterer,
assume
the
responsibility
because
i
take
it
in
an
as-is
condition.
when
the
circumstance
occurred
involving
the
stuyvesant
it
was
the
charterer,
not
anyone
else,
who
had
to
attend
to
the
repairs
and--
mr.
thomas
e.
durkin,
jr.
--oh,
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
durkin,
jr.
only
part
of
the
repair
costs
that
were
encountered
by
the
charterer
in
getting
the
work
done.
in
addition
to
that
two
million
dollars
the
charterer
had
to
pay
more
money
to
the
shipyard.
mr.
thomas
e.
durkin,
jr.
if
in
your
hypothesis
you
suggest
that
the
new
car--
mr.
thomas
e.
durkin,
jr.
--used
car
was
a
day
or
two
old,
because
at
the
time
my
charter
commenced,
my
charter
commenced
the
day
that
ship
left
that
shipyard.
mr.
thomas
e.
durkin,
jr.
absolutely.
mr.
thomas
e.
durkin,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
durkin,
jr.
sir?
mr.
thomas
e.
durkin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
durkin,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
sir.
i
didn't
get
the
second
part.
mr.
thomas
e.
durkin,
jr.
oh,
absolutely.
the
lessor
in
no
way...
the
illustration
of
the
automobile
has
any
right
of
title.
under
your
prior
holdings
in
many,
many
cases,
i
as
a
bareboat
charterer
for
purposes
such
as
these
maintain
a
position
for
these
purposes
as
if
i
were
the
owner.
now,
in
order
to
get
delaval...
that's
not
the
correct
way
to
say
it--
mr.
thomas
e.
durkin,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
durkin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
now,
the
owner,
gecc,
had
no
damage
because
gecc
through
the
trust
company
got
from
me
as
the
charterer
the
per
diem
or
the
weekly
or
the
monthly
amounts
that
it
was
required
to
get
under
the
charter,
whether
or
not
the
ship
was
operational
or
non-operational.
they
sustained
no
damages.
the
only
one
here
who
sustained
the
damage
was
the
charterer
who
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
building
of
the
ship
or
the
entering
into
any
contract
for
the
acquiring
of
the
turbines
or
anything
else.
now,
in
addition
to
the
two
million
dollars,
i
say
that
in
round
figures,
in
order
to
put
the
ship
in
a
condition
for
that
particular
work
to
be
done,
the
charterer
had
to
pay
the
shipyards
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
on
top
of
that
to
equip
the
ship
so
as
for
the
work
that
was
required
to
be
done
on
the
turbine's
done.
and,
sir,
the
third
claim
of
the
damage
that
comes
is
the
amount
that
we
had
to
pay
to
the
owner
under
the
term
of
our
charter,
and
the
fourth
claim
of
damage
would
be
that
amount
that
we
would
be
able
to
collect
from
our
time
charterer
on
our
time
charter
in
this
case,
specific
case
with
sohio.
now,
there
in
the
fourth--
mr.
thomas
e.
durkin,
jr.
--none,
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
durkin,
jr.
well,
i'll
give
you
the
exact
fact.
in
most...
i
have
to
say
most
because
my
experiences
with
charters
are
limited,
but
i
have
never
yet
seen
a
charter
of
this
type
where
the
term
of
the
charter
document
itself
did
not
require
the
time
charterer
to
accept
the
particular
vessel
in
an
as
is
condition.
mr.
thomas
e.
durkin,
jr.
the
risk
as
between
myself
and
the
owner?
mr.
thomas
e.
durkin,
jr.
i
would
think
so,
but
i'm
not
so
sure,
even
if
i
didn't
do
that,
under
the
facts
of
this
case
the
owner
would
assume
any
of
the
responsibilities
that
are
imputable
to
delaval
because
that
owner
bad
nothing
to
do
with
the
particular
contract
for
the
acquiring
of
those
turbines.
that
was
all
done
with
the
shipyard,
and
the
shipyard
in
turn
had
a
contract,
which
contract
was
assigned
in
this
particular
case
to
gecc
via
a
trust
holding,
and
it
was
from
that
particular
entity
that
the
charter
was
enunciated.
mr.
thomas
e.
durkin,
jr.
surely,
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
durkin,
jr.
no,
it
isn't
that...
there
is
nothing
in
the
charter,
and
the
charter
of
course
is
part
of
the
record,
that
i
can
invite
your
attention
to,
that
would
permit
the
charterer
to
claim
against
that
owner
because
of
any
claimed
defect.
i
can't
go
that
far
as
to
say
that
there
wouldn't
be
impossible
as
a
matter
of
law
upon
that
type
of
a
contractual
arrangement,
that
the
ship--
mr.
thomas
e.
durkin,
jr.
--well,
sir,
that
presupposes
that
the
charterer
didn't
conduct
the
usual
full
inspections
prior
to
the
time--
mr.
thomas
e.
durkin,
jr.
--no,
sir.
it's
not
solely
on
the
visual.
these
type
of
inspections
are
in
depth.
mr.
thomas
e.
durkin,
jr.
well,
it
would
be
almost
impossible
to
even
understand
what
the
particular
risk
that
would
be
the
subject
of
the
particular
coverage
involved.
here
the
question
is
going
to
hone
itself
down--
mr.
thomas
e.
durkin,
jr.
--no,
and
when
you
say
it's
not
unforeseeable,
i
guess
that
would
also
include
the
manufacturer
who
represented
that
if
the
manufacturer
could
build
turbines
to
the
specification
of
those
new
tankers
being
built.
now,
here's
a
circumstance
where
a
subsequent
charterer,
a
subsequent
charterer
who
absolutely,
no
fault
of
his,
absolutely
no
fault
of
his,
is
required
to
expend
very
substantial
monies
to
repair
a
turbine
which
by
all
allegations
was
improperly
manufactured.
now,
according
to
all
of
the
circuits
except
the
third,
that
charterer
should
not
be
put
in
that
particular
position
and
that
charterer
should
be
able
to
claim,
if
his
proofs
are
sufficient
to
sustain
the
proofs
required
in
a
damage
claim.
the
third
circuit
says
that
those
particular
claims
are
not
collectible
because
in
varying
ways
they
say
the
turbine
doesn't
fit
into
that
classification
of
unreasonable
risk.
mr.
thomas
e.
durkin,
jr.
yes,
sir,
and
i
have
yet
to
ever
hear,
sir,
yet
to
ever
hear
one
man
who's
ever
been
at
sea
and
had
the
power
unit
go
out
on
a
ship
and
thereafter
indicate
that
that
wasn't
safety...
or
an
unusual
risk
involved.
any
time,
as
was
suggested--
mr.
thomas
e.
durkin,
jr.
--i'm
sorry.
would
you
say
it
again
for
me,
please.
mr.
thomas
e.
durkin,
jr.
the
third
circuit
held
this,
that
unless
there
is
damage
done
other
than
the
damage
to
the
turbine
or
personal
injury,
no
matter
what
else
is
involved,
in
this
circuit
you
cannot
maintain
this
type
of
action.
now,
the
third
circuit
for
the
first
time
seems
to
further
restrict
the
rule
that
may
have
been
claimed
in
certain
state
courts.
certain
state
courts
seem
to
indicate,
including
sealey
in
california,
that
the
damage
that
they
require
as
a
condition
precedent
to
maintaining
this
action
is
a
personal
injury
to
someone
other
than
the
plaintiff,
or
property
damage
other
than
to
this
plaintiff.
the
third
circuit
specifically,
not
only
in
judge
hunter's
opinion
but
also
in
judge
becker's
opinion,
indicates
that
it
must
be
the
particular
plaintiff
involved
that
must
add
that
additional
property
damage
or
that
personal
injury,
and
as
is
obvious,
any
time
that
you
have
a--
mr.
thomas
e.
durkin,
jr.
--i
can't
really
respond--
mr.
thomas
e.
durkin,
jr.
--well,
the
third
circuit
did
say
that
they
were
adopting
what
they
perceived
to
be
the
majority
rule
for
on-land
cases.
mr.
thomas
e.
durkin,
jr.
but
one
of
the
things
that's
intrinsically--
mr.
thomas
e.
durkin,
jr.
--only
in
this
respect,
the
general
rule
as
i
understood
it
previously--
mr.
thomas
e.
durkin,
jr.
--only
in
product
liability
cases
on
land,
if
somebody
other
than
the
plaintiff
were
to
be
injured
as
a
result
of
the
involved
episode
or
somebody
else's
property
were
to
be
damaged
as
a
result
of
the
particular
episode,
under
those
cases
i
read
them
to
mean
that
that
would
satisfy
the
condition
precedent.
as
i
read
the
third
circuit,
the
third
circuit
and
specifically
in
judge
becker's
opinion,
he
puts
in,
in
italics
before,
that
where
plaintiff...
that
there
has
to
be
additional
property
damage
to
the
plaintiff
and
additional
or
personal
injury
to
the
plaintiff
in
order
for
the
condition
precedent
to
be
established
and
maintained.
mr.
thomas
e.
durkin,
jr.
well,
everything
is
irrelevant
to
this
case
factually
because
there
has
never
been
a
contention
throughout
that
if
the
rule
of
the
third
circuit
that
the
risk
is
not
the
test
but
the
occurring
of
the
actual
damage
is
the
test,
there
has
never
been
a
contention
in
this
particular
case
that
even
with
the
steam
emissions
and
so
forth
that
there
was
in
fact
anybody
who
sustained
personal
injury
nor
was
there
any
particular
property
damage.
so,
if
that
particular
rule
of
the
third
circuit
were
to
be
adopted
as
the
rule
with
admiralty,
any
other
fact
involved
would
have
no
consequence
whatsoever.
and
if
i
may,
i
would
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time,
please.
mr.
thomas
e.
durkin,
jr.
very
briefly,
sir.
in
response
to
the
questions
that
justice
o'connor
asked
of
my
adversary,
no
matter
what
else
we
may
disagree
on,
both
of
us
fully
agree
that
at
the
time
that
that
bay
ridge
left
that
shipyard,
that
ring
was
1oo
percent
good.
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
that
ring
at
all.
when
that
turbine
was
being
installed,
not
under
any
strict
liability
in
tort
or
anything
else,
there
is
a
valve
that's
required
to
be
installed
to
govern
the
input
of
steam
to
that
particular
turbine.
that
valve
was
put
in
negligently.
it
was
put
in,
in
reverse.
when
that
ship
had
traveled
almost
to
chile,
because
of
that
valve
being
put
in
wrong
the
turbine
malfunctioned.
our
claim
on
that
bay
ridge
couldn't
be
more
addressed
to
a
straight
negligence
cause
of
action
if
we
tried.
and
the
only
damages
that
we're
claiming
there
are
the
damages
that
are
permitted
under
any
rule
when
that
negligence
is
established.
and
the
second,
and
hopefully
the
last
point,
with
justice
rehnquist,
we're
taking
a
position
throughout
that
the
rule
that
should
govern
is
the
rule
of
the
risk.
as
long
as
the
third
circuit
drafted
a
rule
other
than
that,
there
is
no
way
that
we
could
rebel
against
the
granting
of
a
summary
judgment.
what
the
circumstance
or
the
applicability
of
that
risk
is,
of
course
is
a
factual
question,
or
record
of
which
is
never
in
the
shape
it
should
be
at
this
particular
posture.
if
the
third
circuit's
rule
in
rejecting
the
risk
theory
is
that
there
must
be
the
actual,
then
concededly
there
is
positively
not
fact
issue
in
this
case.
there
wasn't
any
injury,
and
there
wasn't
any
additional
damage.
but
if
the
risk
rule
is
to
be
adopted
and
applied
in
admiralty,
then
we
respectfully
request
that
the
matter
be
remanded
for
a
plenary
hearing
or
fact
determinations
consistent
with
that
participation.
mr.
thomas
e.
durkin,
jr.
land
based
rule,
as
to
the
question
of
risk,
sir?
mr.
thomas
e.
durkin,
jr.
no,
no--
mr.
thomas
e.
durkin,
jr.
--no.
what
i
would
like,
to
state
it
affirmatively,
what
i
would
like
to
do
is
to
follow
the
same
rule
that
the
fifth,
eighth,
ninth
and
eleventh
circuits
have
followed,
both
as
to
the
question
as
to
the
liability
and
the
question
of
the
damage,
one
of
which
was
decided
subsequent
to
the
third
circuit,
the
other
three
of
which,
and
others
were
legion
and
there
was
some
question
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
restricted
to
fishing
vessels.
but
this
which
we
are
expostulating
here
today
has
been
imbedded
in
maritime
and
admiralty
law
for
a
considerable
period
of
time.
thank
you.
