was
the
new
ring
installed
on
the
bay
ridge
the
one
that
was
installed
in
reverse?
justice

well,
it
is
arguable,
i
suppose,
that
on
count
five
there
is
a
valid
negligence
claim?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
wouldn't
that
be
foreseeable,
that
there'd
be
some
down
time
to
replace
it
and
do
the
work
over?
justice

well,
isn't
it
totally
foreseeable
that
if
it's
installed
in
reverse
that
it
will
require
down
time
to
correct
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
just
seems
like
count
five
is
just
an
ordinary,
garden
variety
negligence
claim.
you
install
something
negligently
and
it's
entirely
foreseeable
it
will
have
to
be
done
over
again.
