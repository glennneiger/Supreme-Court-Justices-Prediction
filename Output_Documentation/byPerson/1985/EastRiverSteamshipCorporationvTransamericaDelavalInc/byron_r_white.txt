justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
asking
us
to
make
some
factual
determinations
in
this
court
that...
don't
we
take
the
facts
as
we
find
them
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
know
that
you...
i
thought
we
were
just
going
to
deal
with
the
questions
you
raised
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
contractual
remedy
would
you
have
against
the
owner
from
whom
you
chartered
the
ship?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
you
didn't
bargain
for
it
or
something,
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
just
gave
up
any...
you
just
took
the
risk
that
it
was,
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
wasn't
a
safety
question
and
it
didn't
threaten
persons
or
property?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
it
were,
though,
that
wouldn't
justify
collecting
economic
loss
for
the
delay
or
loss
of
profits?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
kind
of...
the
third
circuit
said
you
couldn't
collect
economic
losses.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
don't
you
think
the
third
circuit
thought
it
was
merely
following
what
the
general
rule
was
in
situations
like
this,
not
just
in
admiralty
but
in
other
actions?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
manufacturer's
liability
or
product
liability
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
challenge
what
it
thought
the
general
rule
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
product
liability
cases
on
land.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
narrowing
is
sort
of
irrelevant
to
this
case,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
both
strict
liability
and
negligence?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
this
kind
of
a
case,
like
a
design
defect
in
a
product?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
on
the
negligence
side
of
it,
what
do
you
do
about
ingram
river
equipment,
in
that
case?
aren't
there
some
courts
of
appeals
that
have
looked
the
other
way
in
this--
justice
byron
r.
white
--how
about
any
other
circuits?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
strict
liability?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
may
be,
but
they
don't
agree
with
you
either.
justice
byron
r.
white
at
some
expense?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
the
bay
ridge?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
major
issue
as
you
see
it,
i
take
it,
is
whether
there
is
any
tort
remedy
at
all
in
this
case
or
whether
there's
either
a
contract
remedy
or
there's
nothing?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
there
is
this
kind
of
a
risk,
or
there
is
an
actual
damage
to
the
person
or
the
property
so
that
this
so-called
precondition
is
satisfied.
what
can
you
recover
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
if
somebody
had
been
hurt
by
this
defective
design--
justice
byron
r.
white
--then
you
think
all
of
these
damages
could
have
been
recovered?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i'm
just
asking
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
loss
of
profits,
and
things
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it
may
not
make
any
difference
what
kind
of
an
action
this
is,
with
respect
to
the
recoverability
of
some
of
these
damages?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
may
not
make
any
difference
what
kind
of
action
it
is.
some
of
these
damages
may
not
be--
justice
byron
r.
white
--you
just
don't
want
to
have
to
litigate
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
case
is
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
sounds
to
me
like
you
would
not
follow
the
land
based
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
there's
some
special
risk
factor
in
admiralty?
