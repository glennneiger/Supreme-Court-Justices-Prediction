justice
thurgood
marshall
counsel,
maybe
i
am
way
off
base,
but
i
don't
quite
understand.
assuming
that
the
trier
of
fact
concludes
that
this
man
would
not
be
helped
out
of
jail,
what
would
he
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
put
the
testimony
on.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
couldn't
withdraw
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
couldn't
blame
that
on
the
state,
could
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
you
don't
begin
to
have
the
man
electrocuted.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
wouldn't
feel
any
counsel
responsibility
for
it
at
all,
would
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
sure
hope
so.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
doubt
you
will
find
any
prisoner
that
at
some
time
didn't
bang
on
the
bars.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
south
carolina,
is
that
the
way
you
proffer
proof?
you
don't
get
the
verbatim
statement?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
witness,
if
permitted
to
testify,
would
testify
as
follows.
you
don't
go
that
route,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
consider
this
a
proffer
of
proof?
justice
thurgood
marshall
of
what?
proof
of
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
agree
that
these
two
guards
testify
as
to
certain
facts,
and
that
would
be
admissible.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
agree
that
there
are
some
things
he
could
say
that
would
be
admissible?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
judge
kept
it
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
did
the
judge
say?
i
am
not
going
to
let
it
in.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
talking
about
page
11.
he
might
get
others
off
on
page
4,
but
i
still
think
page
11
is
this
case.
the
judge
says
you
cannot
put
these
witnesses
on.
