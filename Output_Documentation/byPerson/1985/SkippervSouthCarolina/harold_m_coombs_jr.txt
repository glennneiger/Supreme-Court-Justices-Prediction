mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
state's
position
in
this
case
may,
if
you
will,
be
reduced
to
one
simple
sentence.
predictive
testimony
that
is
offered
in
mitigation
may
be
properly
excluded
when
it
is
merely
based
upon
a
lay
witness's
opinion,
and
when
the
lay
witness's
opinion
is
simply
illustrated
by
evidence
in
the
record,
and
the
jury
is
free
to
consider
that
evidence
for
themselves.
now,
our
position
is
that
this
properly
focuses
the
jury's
attention.
by
properly
focusing
the
jury's
attention
on
the
characteristics
of
the
defendant,
the
characteristics
of
the
crime
that
he
has
committed,
and
his
prison
record,
and
only
allowing
in
relevant
evidence.
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
what
was
excluded
in
this
case,
justice
white,
was
one
thing,
and
that
was
predictive
testimony
from
lay
witnesses.
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
that
was
my
understanding,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
your
honor,
there
was
never
any
specific
testimony
proffered.
the
only
fair
inference
from
the
record,
i
would
submit
to
the
court,
is
that
they
were
offered
for
one
thing,
and
that
was
to
speculate
on
his
future
conduct.
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
i
would
disagree
with
that.
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
if
you
look,
for
example,
at
the
top
of
appendix
page
4,
the
trial
judge
is
confronted
with
what
he
is
going
to
admit
into
evidence,
and
i
think
at
appendix
page
4
he
very
clearly
says
that
insofar
as
evidence
is
offered
which
pertains
to
the
characteristics
of
the
defendant,
it
is
admissible
into
evidence.
if
we
look
at
appendix
page
10,
we
see
that
the
defendant's
former
wife
is
testifying.
she
is
permitted
to
use
the
very
words
that
he
has
made
a
good
adjustment
to
prison.
she
is
permitted
to
testify
as
to
what
she
has
seen
about
ronald
skipper
in
prison.
then,
the
defense
attorney
asks
her
to
predict
over
an
extended
period
of
time
what
is
your
opinion
as
to
whether
he
could
make
a
good
adjustment,
and
it
is
only
at
that
point--
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
--that
is
at
appendix
page
10,
justice
white.
it
is
only
at
that
point
that
the
solicitor
objects.
the
objection
is
sustained,
and
defense
counsel
proceeds
to
make
his
offer
of
proof,
and
when
he
makes
that
offer
of
proof,
that
is
when
very
strangely
he
makes
an
offer
of
proof
for
past
conduct.
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
a
summary
from
counsel
is
usually
considered--
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
--justice
marshall,
they
do
it
one
of
several
ways.
it
is
done
any
number
of
ways.
counsel
may
make
the
offer
of
proof
to
the
court.
he
may
put
the
witness
on
the
stand
and
have
the
offer
go
into
the
record
that
way.
so
the
trial
judge's
discretion
is
my
understanding.
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
i
would
consider
this
an
offer
of
proof.
the
trial
judge--
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
--i
would
say
this
is
an
offer
of
proof
offered
to
relate
back
to
the
question
he
was
attempting
to
elicit
from
the
witness,
which
was
a
prediction
of
future
conduct
over
a
period
of
years.
it
is
only
natural
that
when
the
trial
judge
is
sitting
there
on
the
bench,
and
he
is
deciding,
what
am
i
ruling
upon?
he
is
going
to
go
back
to
the
question
that
was
asked,
and
what
was
that
question?
it
was
a
question
concerning
a
prediction
of
future
conduct.
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
justice
o'connor,
that
would
have
been
admissible.
admissible.
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
admissible.
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
okay,
justice
o'connor,
at
that
point
we
come
to
what
is
meant
by
prison
life.
i
suggest
to
this
court
that
in
light
of
the
south
carolina
supreme
court's
decision
in
plath,
state
v.
plath
and
arnold,
that
when
our
supreme
court
talks
about
prison
life
they
are
talking
about
such
things
as
how
well
the
prisoner
is
going
to
be
able
to
take
one
shower
a
week.
i
will
use
the
example
used
in
plath.
or
whether
he
is
going
to
be
personally
happy.
they
are
not
talking
about
his
interaction
with
other
prisoners.
most
certainly
they
are
not
talking
about
future
dangerousness.
state
v.
woomer
was
decided
when
the
present
case--
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
--it
depends
what
you
mean
by
future
adjustment
in
prison,
justice
o'connor.
if
it
is
something
that
is
going
to
be
of
consequence
to
the
determination
of
whether
or
not
this
man
lives
or
dies--
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
--yes,
it
would
be
admissible,
very
clearly
admissible.
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
no,
justice
o'connor.
i
do
not
believe
that
that
is
a
fair
reading
of
this
record.
i
believe
that
the
defendant
was
able--
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
--that
was
the
prosecutor's
inference,
your
honor.
there
is
plenty
of
evidence
in
this
record.
there
is
plenty
of
evidence
in
the
record
from
which
the
prosecutor
could
have
drawn
that
inference.
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
if
the
testimony
from
the
corrections
officers
had
been
proffered
for
the
purpose
of
testifying
to
things
that
they
had
observed
concerning
ronnie
skipper
when
he
was
in
jail,
that
testimony
was
admissible.
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
okay,
that
is
from,
i
would
guess,
appendix
page
11.
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
justice
white,
again,
you
have
to
look
at
the
question
that
was
raised.
he
was
trying
to
introduce--
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
--that
is
part
of
the
offer
of
proof,
your
honor.
the
question
where
the
solicitor
objected
was
a
question
which
called
upon
his
former
wife
to
predict
future
behavior
over
a
period
of
years
in
prison.
when
you
examine
this
record,
i
suggest
the
record
is
replete--
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
--i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
i
don't
understand
your
question,
justice
white.
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
that
would
have
been
admissible.
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
i
think,
justice
rehnquist,
you
have
to
look
at
the
entire
record,
and
i
think
at
that
point,
on
that
one
isolated
page
of
the
appendix,
that
the
trial
judge
still
has
the
objection
on
his
mind
from
page
10,
but
we
can
certainly
look,
for
example,
at
appendix
page
4.
we
can
look
at
the
extensive
record
before
the
court
in
this
case.
for
example,
the
defendant
in
this
case
testified
from
the
stand
that
when
he
was
in
prison
he
had
learned
vocational
skills.
he
had
applied
those
skills.
he
was--
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
--his
wife,
his
former
wife
was
certainly
permitted
to
testify
about
how
he
conducted
himself
in
prison--
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
--if
the
prison
guards
limited
their
testimony
to
things
that
they
had
actually
seen,
that
is
exactly
right,
your
honor.
presumably
it
would
have
been
very
similar.
they
would
have
been
paralleled
one
another.
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
evidence
about
his
conduct
certainly
was
admissible.
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
i
think,
your
honor,
the
question
is,
what
does
the
trial
judge
have
on
his
mind
in
appendix
page
11.
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
our
position,
your
honor,
is
that
observations
of
past
conduct
are
admissible.
lay
witnesses'
testimony
which
merely
seeks
to
predict
future
conduct
is
inadmissible,
and
i
suggest
the
record
is
entirely
consistent
with
that
view.
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
again,
that
means...
you
have
to
consider
what
you
mean
by
prison
life.
might
i
suggest
for
the
court's--
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
--if
you
mean
showering,
how
often
does
he
shower,
that
is
not
admissible.
if
it
means
is
he
going
to
be
a
productive
prisoner,
it
most
certainly
is
admissible,
and
i
would
cite
this
court
to
transcript
page
1257.
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
the
only
thing
i
can
say
there
is
that
he
still
had
on
his
mind
the
question
that
was
raised
at
appendix
page
10.
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
i
get
my
view,
for
example,
from
the
whole--
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
--i
don't
think
he
understood
one
single
question.
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
no,
he
didn't
commit
error
because
he
let
in
everything
that
was
offered
to
show
past
conduct
and
he
put
this
to
the
jury.
he
put
it
to
the
jury
at
trial
transcript
page
1,257.
he
charges
the
jury.
he
charges
the
jury
on
nonstatutory
mitigating
circumstances.
and
he
says,
nonstatutory
mitigating
circumstance
number
4,
the
defendant
is
now
and
during
the
confinement
under
life
sentence
would
be
free
of
all
alcohol
and
drug
dependence.
one
more,
if
i
might
read
it
to
the
court.
nonstatutory
aggravating
circumstance
number
5.
the
defendant
has
shown
a
progressive
positive
adjustment
to
confinement,
and
he
has
the
educational
and
employment
skills
that
would
enable
him
to
be
a
stable,
productive
prisoner.
the
only
thing
that
was
kept
out
in
this
case
is
simply
the
predictive
testimony
of
lay
witnesses.
what
was
included
would
be
the
observations
of
all
the
lay
witnesses
as
to
what
they
actually
see.
once
that
was
in
the
record,
then
the
jury
was
free
to
consider,
to
evaluate,
and
if
they
wanted
to
use
that
as
a
mitigating
circumstance
that
mitigates
against
the
death
penalty,
they
were
free
to
take
that
into
consideration
and
give
it
whatever
weight
they
chose.
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
we
don't
have
that
in
the
record,
but
just
hypothetically.
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
i
certainly
do.
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
i
do
not
agree
with
that.
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
he
said
at
the
top
of
appendix
page
4,
for
example,
he
said
anything--
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
--transcript
page
11
or
appendix
page
11
takes
place
for
one
reason,
because
on
page
10
defense
counsel
has
asked
his
former
wife
to
make
a
prediction
as
to
what
his
behavior
in
prison
is
going
to
be
over
a
period
of
years.
that
takes
place
the
bottom
third
roughly
of
appendix
page
10.
under
prison
conditions
over
an
extended
period
of
time,
what
is
your
opinion
as
to
whether
he
could
make
a
good
adjustment?
i
say
very
clearly
that
is
asking
her
to
speculate
on
his
future
conduct.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
what
she
herself
has
actually
seen.
i
remind
the
court,
suggest
to
the
court
once
again
that
his
former
wife
was
permitted
to
characterize
her
own
testimony,
to
describe
the
testimony
and
then
characterize
it
by
saying
that
mr.
skipper
had
made
a
good
adjustment
to
prison.
the
defendant's
mother
could
testify
that
he
had
been
free
of
drugs.
again,
the
jury
could
take
that
and
give
it
whatever
weight
they
might
choose.
the
defendant
himself
went
into
excruciating
detail
about
his
past
conduct,
his
present
conduct,
and
even
his
future
conduct,
and
how
detailed
is
his
testimony,
what
kind
of
leeway
did
the
trial
judge
give
to
this
prisoner.
he
even
allowed
him
to
predict
that
a
south
carolina
public
school
would
be
the
school
of
choice
for
his
own
children.
i
think
based
upon
this
record
it
is
hard
to
imagine
a
factual
scenario
of
where
a
trial
judge
has
given
a
prisoner
more
leeway
in
putting
before
the
jury
the
circumstances
and
the
facts
which
the
jury
may
consider
and
decide
if
they
think
that
is
a
proper
matter
to
use
in
mitigation
of
the
death
penalty.
our
position
is
that
the
evidence
is
to
be
presented
by
the
witnesses.
once
that
evidence
is
presented,
it
is
for
the
jury
to
attach
whatever
weight,
whatever
meaning
that
they
see
is
fit.
on
the
basis
of
this
record,
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
that
his
former
wife
or
the
prison
guards
or
the
jail
visitors
have
any
special
knowledge,
any
special
insight
that
can
make
their
testimony,
their
observations
more
meaningful
for
that
jury.
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
i
certainly
have,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
the
only
thing
i
can
suggest
is
at
transcript
page
11
or
appendix
page
11
has
to
be
read
along
with
appendix
page
10,
it
has
to
be
read
along
with
the
top
of
appendix
page
4.
and
it
has
to
be
read
along
with
everything
else
the
trial
judge
admitted
in
evidence
during
the
course
of
this
trial,
which
is
some
considerable
volume,
right
here.
we
are
talking
about--
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
--again,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
transcript
at
page
1,257.
obviously,
there
is
some
misunderstanding.
the
trial
judge
at
transcript
or
appendix
page
11
thinks
we
are
still
talking
about
future
adjustability,
because
at
1,257
he
says
as
a
nonstatutory
mitigating
circumstance
the
defendant
has
shown
a
progressive
positive
adjustment
to
confinement,
and
he
has
the
educational
and
employment
skills
that
would
enable
him
to
be
a
stable,
productive
prisoner.
so,
obviously
the
trial
judge
believed
that
that
was
proper,
relevant,
admissible
testimony.
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
that
is
exactly
right.
at
appendix
page
11,
he
made
a
mistake,
and
why
did
he
make
a
mistake?
because
once
questions
had
been
asked
calling
for
a
prediction
of
future
conduct,
and
that
objection
was
sustained,
defense
counsel
then
proceeded
to
make
an
offer
of
proof
of
past
conduct,
which
is
nonsensical.
the
trial
judge
became
temporarily
confused
at
appendix
page
11,
and
that
is
exactly
what
happened.
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
it
was
a
mere
number
of
words
that
made
absolutely
no
difference
whatsoever
as
to
what
was
admitted
or
not
admitted
at
trial.
the
only
reason
he
wanted
those
prison
guards
to
testify,
the
only
reason
he
wanted
the
jailhouse
visitor
to
testify
was
for
purposes
of
predicting
lay
testimony,
predicting
future
adaptability
to
prison.
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
justice
stevens,
that
again
goes
to
what
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
has
considered
prison
life
to
be.
for
example,
in
state
v.
plath,
they
don't
think
that...
they
consider
prison
life
to
involve
simply
matters
of
personal
hygiene
or
something
along
those
lines,
how
often
he
showers.
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
i
don't
believe
it
does,
your
honor.
you
have
to
read
the
whole
series
of
cases.
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
not
in
the
opinion
itself.
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
with
one
exception,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
on
the
record
here
whether
the
trial
judge
said
anything
about
state
v.
woomer.
state
v.
woomer
is
an
opinion
of
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
which
had
been
published
at
the
time
of
the
instant
case.
state
v.
woomer--
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
--i
believe...
i
know
it
had
come
out
one
day
apart,
roughly
at
the
same
time.
woomer
holds
that
expert
testimony
predicting
future
conduct
is
admissible.

that

future
dangerousness

the
only--
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
--i
think
future
nondangerousness
could
well
be
construed
as
being
the
same
thing
as
future
good
conduct
in
prison.
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
in
the
present
case,
it
was
admissible.
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
it
is
generally
admissible
so
long
as
it
concerns
matters
of
consequence.
it
is
not
admissible
if
it
concerns
simply
how
often
he
might
take
a
shower
in
prison.
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
i
think
it
was
talking
about
predicted
future
conduct,
your
honor,
not
taking
a
shower.
i
don't
believe
it
concerned
a
shower.
i
think
it
concerned...
is
probably
as
vague...
i
believe
it
is
as
vague
as
in
the
present
case.
simply
testimony
from
lay
witnesses
concerning
their
predictions
of
future
conduct.
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
i
just
read
the
opinions,
your
honor.
i
don't
have
any
special
insight
into
that.
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
i
believe,
your
honor,
it
was
expert
testimony,
but
it
was--
mr.
harold
m.
coombs,
jr.
--it
was
expert
testimony,
i
believe,
that
was
concerned
with
prison
life,
adjustability
to
this
very
vague,
nebulous
term,
prison
life.
and
again
i
say
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
considered
prison
life
often
to
involve
matters
which
are
not
relevant.
we
believe
that
it
is
inescapable,
and
it
is
inescapable
because
this
court
has
said
so
in
jurek
v.
texas,
that
every
time
a
sentencing
authority
has
jurisdiction,
every
time
that
it
has
discretion,
it
has
to
make
some
sort
of
inherent
prediction
concerning
future
conduct.
we
submit
that
this
has
been
taken
into
consideration
by
the
state
of
south
carolina.
we
feel
that
by
limiting
testimony,
by
excluding
testimony
of
things
that
are
not
relevant,
the
jury
sentencing
discretion
is
properly
focused.
we
think
the
state
has
made
a
valid
decision
in
focusing
the
attention
of
the
sentencing
authority
in
this
case,
and
we
would
ask
that
the
judgment
be
sustained.
unless
there
are
any
questions--
