justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
on
that,
directed
at
what
issue
is
the
evidence
of
past
conduct
admissible?
is
it
admissible
on
the
issue
of
adjustability
to
prison
life?
justice
john
paul
stevens
whatever
the
judge
meant
when
he
said
it
is
not
admissible
on
adjustability
to
prison
life.
in
your
view,
is
it
admissible
on
that
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
keep
you
on
this
for
a
moment.
you
concede
that
the
evidence
of
past
conduct
would
be
admissible
on
the
issue
of
adjustability
to
prison
life
if
the
term
adjustability
to
prison
life
is
properly
understood.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
how
do
you
defend
the
judge's
ruling
at
the
bottom
of
page
11?
justice
john
paul
stevens
where
do
you
get
your
view
of
the
law
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
agree
he
committed
error
because
he
didn't
understand
the
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
just
explains,
it
doesn't
justify
the
error.
did
he
commit
error?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
say
about
the
opinion
of
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
that
says
that
the
convicted
murderer's
adaptability
to
prison
life
is
not
a
matter
of
any
relevance
to
the
sentencing
proceeding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
where
does
the
opinion
in
koon
i
make
that
differentiation
between
kinds
of
adaptability
to
prison
life?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
reading
the
opinion,
not
anything
in
the
opinion
itself.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
is
clear,
is
it
not,
that
the
judge
apparently
read
his
reference
to
what
is
not
admissible
is
exactly
the
same
thing
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
said,
that
adjustability
to
prison
life...
they
used
the
word
adaptability
instead
of
adjustability...
is
not
an
issue
at
the
penalty
hearing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
same
day
as
koon
i,
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
a
little
different
from
adjustability
to
prison
life.
or
do
you
say
that
is
the
same
as
adjustability
to
prison
life?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
put
it
this
way.
in
your
view,
is
testimony
directed
at
the
issue
of
whether
an
inmate
is
adjustable
to
prison
life
admissible
or
inadmissible
in
south
carolina
at
a
penalty
hearing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
a
general
proposition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
was
the
evidence
at
stake
in
koon
i
that
was
excluded?
what
was
the
supreme
court
talking
about
there
when
it
said
this
evidence
is
totally
irrelevant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
that
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
knew
what
it
was
saying
when
it
wrote
that
opinion?
they
apparently
say
the
trial
judge
didn't
know
what
he
was
saying.
