chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
skipper
against
south
carolina.
mr.
bruck,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
notice
you
rely
a
great
deal
on
lockett
when
it
refers
to
aspects
of
the
defendant's
character
and
record.
now,
the
character
and
record,
when
were
the
character
and
record
of
this
man
made,
before
he
committed
the
crime
or
after
he
committed
the
crime?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
lockett
contemplated
some
character
evaluation
of
how
he
has
acted
after
the
crime
and
while
he
is
awaiting
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn't
character
an
evaluation
of
past
conduct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
they
gave
him
a
trial
within
a
week.
do
you
suggest
that
the
evidence
about
his
conduct
the
week
between
the
time
he
committed
the
crime
and
the
time
he
was
tried
has
any
bearing
on
this
issue?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
at
1:00
o'clock,
counsel.
mr.
bruck,
you
may
resume
your
argument.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
go
back
to
the
question
i
put
to
you
before
lunch.
suppose
within
60
days
after
the
murder,
the
case
comes
to
trial.
is
it
your
suggestion
that
lockett
requires,
the
constitution
requires
that
the
court
admit
evidence
about
his
good
behavior
during
the
two
months
between
the
time
of
the
murder
and
the
time
of
the
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
ordinarily
the
character
of
a
person
like
reputation
is
based
on
always
past
events,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
necessarily
current
events,
but
things
past.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
saying
he
might
be
able
to
function
very
well
in
the
controlled
environment
of
a
prison.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
the
issue--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--that
society
is
probing
at,
how
he
is
going
to
act
in
prison?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
coombs.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
having
difficulty
following
your
argument,
counsel.
you
conceded
in
response
to
several
questions
that
evidence
about
his
conduct
was
admissible.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
his
counsel
then
offers
to
present
evidence
on
precisely
that
question,
and
you
say
it
is
not
admissible.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
we
have
to
go
on
the
basis
of
the
record,
not
what
is
in
his
mind.
you
have
said,
perfectly
clear,
several
responses,
that
that
evidence
is
admissible,
and
then
the
judge
rules
it
is
not
admissible,
and
you
either
have
to
defend
it
or
concede
it,
or
say
that
it
is
totally
irrelevant.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
still
having
difficulty.
at
the
bottom
of
page
11,
they
are
discussing
what
they
are
trying
to
introduce.
they
are
trying
to
introduce
evidence
of
three
people
which
would
bear
on
whether
he
could
or
could
not
adjust
to
prison
life.
and
the
judge
said,
that
is
irrelevant.
they
will
not
be
permitted
to
testify.
but
you
have
already
conceded
several
times
that
that
would
be
admissible
evidence
if
there
was
no
opinion
given.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judge
has
told
him
categorically,
whether
he
can
or
cannot
adjust
to
prison
life
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
he
said
the
contrary,
categorically.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
bruck?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
