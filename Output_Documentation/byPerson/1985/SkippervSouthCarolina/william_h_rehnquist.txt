justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
state
did
not
make
future
dangerousness
an
element
of
the
sentencing
process
in
any
way.
do
you
still
think
the
constitution
would
require
south
carolina
to
admit
the
sort
of
testimony
that
justice
powell
was
asking
you
about?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
some
states
bar
evidence
that
is
not
ante
litem
motam,
so
to
speak,
evidence
that
may
have
been
concocted
by
a
party
over
a
short
period
of
time
after
the
event
which
is
being
judged
came
into
effect.
now,
you
are
saying,
i
take
it,
that
the
state
can't
do
that
here,
that
it
is
strictly
a
matter
for
cross
examination.
they
can't
ever
say
that
this
conduct
was
shaped
by
the
defendant
in
order
to
produce
evidence
for
this
trial.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
is
hard
to
justify
in
light
of
the
colloquy
on
page
11,
i
think,
mr.
coombs.
the
court
had
sustained
an
objection
to
the
wife's
testimony
about
whether
or
not
he
could
adjust,
and
then
counsel
says,
we
want
to
take
up
a
matter
of
law
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury.
now,
the
counsel
didn't
reargue
the
wife's
admissibility.
he
said,
i've
got
two
witnesses
here,
and
as
justice
white
said,
we
have
under
subpoena
to
testify
that
the
defendant
has
made
a
good
adjustment,
and
then
the
trial
court
obviously
thinks
he
is
still
talking
along
the
same
line
as
before,
but
he
wasn't,
and
surely...
i
mean,
we
can't
say
that
he
didn't
make
his
point
to
the
trial
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there
is
certainly
some
evidence
of
confusion
in
the
transcript
on
page
11,
where
counsel
says
i
am
offering
it
to
prove
what
did
happen,
and
the
trial
judge
says,
well,
his
answer
is
such,
he
indicates
he
still
thinks
it
is
being
offered
to
prove
future
conduct.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
yes.
i
suppose
you
could
say
that,
but
i
don't
think
it
is
entirely
fair
to
say
that
the
trial
court
ruled
absolutely
consistently
throughout.
