justice
byron
r.
white
but,
of
course,
we
did
limit
certiorari
here,
didn't
we?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
evidence
of
future
adaptability?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
doesn't
the
state
say
now
that
that
very
testimony
would
be
admissible
at
least
for
some
limited
purpose?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
tell
me
now
that
south
carolina
would
always
exclude
the
testimony
of
an
expert
if
he
purported
to
predict
how
the
prisoner
would
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
understand
the
state's
submission
now
to
be
to
the
contrary?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
it
is
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
a
question
to
these
two
witnesses
had
been,
in
the
hope
of
the
court,
well,
now,
we
have
asked
you
to
describe
how
he
has
acted
in
the
past.
what
would
be
your
prediction
for
the
future?
don't
you
think
that
question
would
be
proper?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
there
is
no
yes
or
no
answer
to
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
out
of
state,
so
don't
permit
testimony
on
the
ultimate
issue
the
jury
has
to
decide.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
is
pretty
ultimate.
it
is
pretty
ultimate.
justice
byron
r.
white
including
a
prison
guard.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
a
state,
if
it
permits
the
prison
guard
to
testify
on
what
he
has
seen
and
heard,
wouldn't
need
to
permit
an
opinion
from
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
excluded
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
wasn't
what
was
asked,
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
question
that
these
prison
guards
weren't
permitted
to
answer?
justice
byron
r.
white
weren't
they
just
going
to...
wasn't
it
just
said
that
they
were
going
to
testify
about
how
he
had
conducted
himself
since
he
had
been
in
jail?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
exactly
what
mr.
dusenberry
said.
your
honor,
we
have
under
subpoena
two
jailers
to
testify
that
the
defendant
has
made...
has
made
a
good
adjustment.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
you
say
that
is
very
strange,
but
the
court
says,
whether
he
can
or
cannot
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
even
if
they
stay
after
this
initial
period,
he
has
made
a
good
adjustment.
the
court
says,
read
koons.
that
is
not
an
issue.
so
none
of
these
witnesses
would
be
permitted
to
testify,
dusenberry
asked.
the
court
says
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
i
just
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
say
that
you
would
say,
we
should
judge
this
case,
at
you
say
we
should,
on
the
basis
that
if
all
the
wanted
to
do
was
to
put
on
these
two
jailers
to
testify
how
these
people
had...
how
this
defendant
had
behaved
himself
in
prison
in
the
past,
it
would
have
been
admissible.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
defense
had
said,
i
want
to
call
these
two
prison
guards,
i
want
to
ask
them
how
this
defendant
has
conducted
himself
in
the
past,
while
he
has
been
in
prison,
admissible,
i
gather.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
his
wife
was
permitted
to
testify
about
how
he
had
conducted
himself.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
same
sort
of
things
that
the
prison
guards
were
going
to
talk
about.
