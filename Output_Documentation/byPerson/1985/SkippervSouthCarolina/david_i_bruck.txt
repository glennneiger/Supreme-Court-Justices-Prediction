mr.
david
i.
bruck
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
in
this
case
the
petitioner,
ronald
skipper,
was
convicted
of
murder
and
rape
in
the
south
carolina
supreme
court,
and
was
sentenced
to
death.
at
his
sentencing
hearing
before
the
trial
jury,
one
of
the
mitigating
factors
which
he
attempted
to
submit
for
the
jury's
consideration
was
evidence
of
his
past
good
conduct
and
successful
adaptation
to
a
jail
environment
during
the
seven-and-a-half
months
between
the
time
of
his
arrest
and
the
time
of
his
trial.
he
attempted
to
prove
this
obviously
for
the
purpose
of
persuading
the
jury
whose
sole
decision
of
the
sentencing
phase
was
whether
to
send
him
to
prison
for
life
or
whether
to
sentence
him
to
death,
that
if
he
were
sentenced
to
life
instead
of
death,
he
could
be
expected
to
continue
to
conduct
himself
in
a
non-violent
manner,
and
that
he
would
adapt
successfully
and
non-violently
to
the
regime
of
imprisonment.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
in
terms
of
an
offer
of
their
testimony
on
the
witness
stand
in
camera,
no,
it
does
not.
this
proffer,
the
proffer
is
contained
primarily
at
page
11
of
the
joint
appendix,
and
it
is
counsel
standing
in
place
and
representing
to
the
trial
judge
what
the
witnesses
would
say.
we
have
under
subpoena,
your
honor,
two
jailers
to
testify
that
the
defendant
has
made
a
good
adjustment,
and
at
that
point
the
court
says
that
that
issue
is
not
relevant.
the
actual
testimony
is
not
in
the
record.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
yes,
that
is
what
was
proffered.
it
is
that
he
made
a
good
adjustment.
it
was
obviously
being
offered
for
the
purpose
of
permitting
the
sentencing
authority
to
draw
the
conclusion
about
his
future
conduct.
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
seemed
to
feel
that
both
were
offered.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
yes,
your
honor,
but
for
a
very
limited
purpose.
south
carolina
has
again
and
again
and
again
adhered
to
the
position
first
expressed
in
koon
i,
which
was
the
basis
of
the
ruling
here
that
the
issue
of
the
future
good
conduct
of
a
defendant
in
prison
is
irrelevant.
however,
in
koon
ii,
a
case
decided
nearly
a
year
after
this
trial,
and
thus
of
no
relevance
to
what
happened
here,
the
court
said
that
past
good
conduct
in
jail
is
admissible
but
only
as
general
evidence
of
the
good
character
of
the
defendant.
it
is
not
admissible
on
the
issue
of
good
conduct
in
jail,
which
the
court
has
continued
over
and
over
again
to
say
is
inadmissible,
and
proof
of
that,
our
position
is
that
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
has
repeatedly,
beginning
with
koon
i
and
as
recently
as
state
against
chaffee,
cited
in
my
brief,
upheld
the
exclusion
of
expert
psychiatric
testimony
which
was
focusing
solely
on
whether
or
not
based
on
a
psychiatric
evaluation
of
this
defendant
his
likely
future
conduct
in
prison
would
be
good.
that
conduct
is
always
excluded,
and
it
is
always
excluded
under
south
carolina
law
on
grounds
of
relevancy,
that
is,
the
relevancy
of
the
issue.
there
has
never
been
a
case
in
which
a
psychiatrist
offering
his
testimony
was
held
to
have
offered
him
competent
testimony,
unreliable
testimony.
south
carolina
focuses
solely
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
question
of
his
future
conduct
itself
is
relevant,
and
south
carolina
says
that
it
is
not,
and
that
is
the
issue
before
the
court.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
yes.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
evidence
tending
to
prove
future
adaptability.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
obviously,
the
evidence
was
not
offered
idly.
it
was
not
offered
to
satisfy
the
jury's
curiosity,
but
rather
to
allow
the
jury
to
make
its
own
conclusions.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
for
a
very
limited
purpose,
a
purpose
so
limited
that
south
carolina
has
almost
invariably
found
exclusion
to
be
harmless
error
in
all
but
one
case
since
this
time.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
that's
correct.
there
are,
i
think,
three
or
four
decisions
that
have
been
filed
in
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
dealing
with
not
past
testimony
of
guards,
but--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--well,
yes.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
state
seems
at
some
point
in
its
brief
to
say
in
the
teeth
of
all
of
the
south
carolina
decisions
that
in
fact
the
rule
of
state
against
koon
isn't
really
such
a
rule,
and
that
all
south
carolina
excludes
is
incompetent
lay
opinion
testimony.
well,
there
are
two
things
wrong
with
that.
the
main
thing
that
is
wrong
with
it--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--is
that
it
isn't
true.
0
[generallaughter.]
the
second
thing
that
is
wrong
with
it
is
that
if
it
were
true,
this
testimony
in
this
case
would
not
have
been
excluded
because
if
you
look
at
the
record,
the
testimony
was
as
to
his
past--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--conduct.
sir?
mr.
david
i.
bruck
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
the
answer
to
that
is
yes.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
would
it
have
been
appropriate
for
that
testimony
to
have--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--what
was
offered
was
not
speculation.
it
was
his
past
record,
and
that
would
have
been
admissible.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
if
the
question
is,
would
their
speculation--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--correct.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
correct.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
yes,
sir.
their
observations,
what
they
saw,
not
necessarily
their
opinions,
but
what
they
saw
over
seven-and-a-half
months
of
day-to-day
conduct
with
this
man
would
most
certainly
have
been
admissible
as
an
aspect
of
his
character
within
the
language
of...
an
aspect
of
his
record
bearing
on
his
character
and
enabling
the
jury
to
make
an
intelligent
decision
about
one
of
the
crucial
issues
that
they
had
to
confront.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
yes,
i
believe
it
would.
of
course,
that
is
not
the
situation
we
have
in
this
case.
but
i
think
there
are...
i
have
two
responses
to
that.
first,
i
think
that
all
of
this
court's
capital
sentencing
case
recognize
the
calculations
of
future
dangerousness,
of
future
behavior,
whether
it
be
bad
or
good,
the
capacity
for
rehabilitation
is
at
the
very
core
of
what
american
judges
and
juries
do
when
they
pass
sentence
in
all
kinds
of
cases,
and
this
court's
cases
go
back
half
a
century
and
more
discussing
that
fact.
in
lockett
itself,
one
of
the
mitigating
circumstances
that
was
excluded
was
the
defendant's
capacity
for
rehabilitation,
psychiatric--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--i
read
lockett
to
say
both.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
that
is
my
reading.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
it
is
partly
that,
and
it
is
partly
an
evaluation...
the
jury
cannot
avoid
the
question,
if
we
spare
this
man's
life,
then
what?
the
jury
has
a
great
responsibility
when
they
sentence
him
to
death,
but
they
also
have
a
great
responsibility
when
they
take
a
convicted
murderer
and
allow
him
to
live.
they
cannot...
the
state
cannot
wish
away
the
question
that
is
going
to
arise
in
the
jury
room,
will
this
person
harm
other
people
if
we
don't
sentence
him
to
death.
that
question
is
there.
it
is
inherent
when
a
judge
passes
sentence.
it
is
inherent
when
a
jury
passes
sentence.
the
jury
will
make
the
question...
will
answer
that
question
in
one
of
two
ways.
it
will
answer
it
on
the
basis
of
all
relevant
information,
and
if
they
are
given
that
opportunity,
they
will
answer
it
correctly
as
well
as
our
judicial
system
can
possibly
allow,
or
the
jury
will
answer
the
question
in
an
artificially
created
blackout
of
information,
as
happened
in
this
case,
where
the
most
reliable
evidence
of
what
was
likely
to
happen
if
we
spared
this
man's
life,
the
testimony
of
his
jailers,
the
people
that
had
had
him
and
could
see
him
day
to
day
and
could
form
a
judgment
of
how
he
would
likely
do
in
confined--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--i
would
suggest
that
that
would
be
of
vanishingly
small
weight.
as
a
general
matter,
my
answer
would
be
that
the
weight
to
be
accorded
to
mitigating
evidence
is
for
the
sentencer,
and
all
that
lockett
and
all
that
eddings
say
is
that
the
state
may
not
give
it
no
weight
by
exclusion.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
i
would
think
that
a
jailer
who
is
a
person--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--i
would
think
as
to
the
jailers
the
question
would
be
proper,
but
i
think
that
is
a
question
on
which
the
states
enjoy
a
degree
of
latitude
in
deciding
the
reliability
of
evidence.
under
south
carolina
law...
would
be
admissible.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
well,
of
course,
this
isn't
the
ultimate
issue.
it
is
an
issue
of
some
importance.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
i
think
if
the
witness
was
allowed
to
give
all
of
the
basis,
all
of
the
facts
that
he
observed,
i
do
not
think
the
constitution
would
require
us
to
give
a
straight
answer.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
thank
you,
your
honor.
if
i
may
complete
my
response
to
justice
white,
i
think
basically
petitioner's
position
would
be
that
where
a
lay
witness
is
permitted
to
give
all
of
his
observations
and
provide
all
of
what
he
has
to
say
based
on
his
own
knowledge
and
experience
and
what
he
had
seen,
the
constitution
would
not
require
that
that
lay
witness's
opinion
also
be
admitted
in
mitigation
of
punishment.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
i
would
say
including
a
prison
guard.
south
carolina
law,
i
believe,
state
evidentiary
law
would
admit
the
testimony
as,
i
believe,
would
the
federal
rules,
because
that
is
someone
whose
knowledge
is
based
on
special
experience.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
that
is
correct.
that
is
cur
position.
all
of
this,
as
i
mentioned
briefly
at
the
beginning,
has
to
do
with
what
the
jury
actually
is
required...
what
is
actually
required
of
the
jury
at
the
sentencing
phase.
as
the
joint
opinion
in
jurek
stated,
any
sentencing
authority
must
predict
a
convicted
person's
probable
future
conduct
when
it
engages
in
the
process
of
determining
what
sentence
to
impose.
that
is
simply
an
inquiry
which
cannot
be
willed
away.
at
bottom,
i
read
lockett
to
be
concerned
with
accuracy,
with
reliability,
with
the
concern
of
the
eighth
amendment,
and
if
we
are
to
sentence
people
to
death,
let
it
not
be
in
error.
let
it
be
only
based
on
the
facts
as
best
we
can
bring
them
to
the
sentencer's
attention.
what
we
have
here
in
this
case,
i
think,
is
an
exceptionally
clear
example
of
the
sentencing
determination
fraught
with
the
potential
for
error,
because
not
only
were
the
state's
own
witnesses,
the
jail
guards,
who
knew
the
most
about
how
this
man
was
likely
to
do
in
prison,
prohibited
from
testifying--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--yes.
i
think
that
would
again
be
for
the
weight,
and
the
weight,
as
the
court
said
in
eddings,
is
not
for
the
law,
not
for
the
legislature,
but
for
the
jury.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
yes.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
well,
things
past
up
to
the
time
when
his
character
is
being
evaluated,
which
is
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
the
way
people...
and
this
is
often
the
case
when
you
have
people
who
are
mentally
ill
or
who
suffer
from
character
disorders,
and
there
was
abundant
evidence
in
this
record
that
this
man
was
a
product
of
an
alcoholic
home,
of
child
abuse,
of
terrible
domestic
violence,
and
this
is
the
sort
of
person
that
may
well
be
unable
to
function
out
in
society,
and
yet
in
a
structured
environment
might
well
be
able
to
function
very
well,
and
we
all
know
of
dramatic
examples
of
that.
the
birdman
of
alcatraz.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
correct.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
that
certainly
was.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
yes,
that
is
the
issue.
a
jail
environment
is
certainly
similar
to
a
prison
environment,
perhaps
not
identical,
and
that
would
be
an
issue
for
cross
examination
by
the
state,
to
try
to
bring
out
ways
in
which
this
may
not
really
be
all
that
probative.
that
is
grist
for
the
jury
mill.
these
are
the
things
we
have
trials
to
determine.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
the
prosecutor
can
certainly
say
that
to
the
jury,
but
i
don't
think
the
state
can
say
as
a
matter
of
law
that
because
of
the
danger
that
defendant
is
putting
on
an
act,
that
therefore
that
cannot
even
be
weighed
by
the
jury,
that
the
jury
can't
even
hear
it.
after
all,
we
have
situations
in
which
defendants
have
been
incarcerated
for
two
and
three
years,
and
then
have
a
retrial,
and
their
prison
behavior
can
be
assessed
over
a
very
long
period
of
time.
now,
there
is
still
the
possibility
that
it
was
still
concocted.
i
don't
know
that
any
arbitrary
time
deadline
of
a
week
or
60
days
could
ever
be
meaningfully
developed.
we
could
say,
well,
this
is
too
short,
or
there
is
too
great
a
risk.
i
mean,
there
are
all
kinds
of
dangers.
in
washington,
for
instance.
texas
recognized
the
danger
that
co-defendants
would
concoct
their
stories
and
try
to
swear
each
other
off
the
charges,
and
therefore...
and
that
is
not
a
completely
irrational
concern.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
would
not
be
helped
in
the
sense
that
if
the
trier
of
fact
concluded
that
his
conduct
would
be
bad,
that
he
would
be
violent
in
jail,
that
he
would
rape
other
inmates,
as
the
prosecutor
argued
in
this
case,
that
would
be
a
consideration
weighing
in
favor
of
death.
if
the
trier
of
fact
included
that
probably
this
man's
conduct
would
be
good
in
the
sense
of
nonviolent--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--that's
correct.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
oh,
you
mean
if
the
witnesses
were
called
and
they
said,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
guy
was
being
a
real
problem,
he
banged
on
the
bars
and
that
is
about
all
we
have
got
to
say
about
it.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
absolutely
not.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
that
is
right.
if
we
didn't
interview
our
witnesses
first
and
call
them,
and
indeed--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--i
would
feel
grave
responsibility
if
i
called
a
witness
and
didn't
know
what
he
was
going
to
say
and
he
hurt
my
client.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
yes,
sir.
i
sure
would.
by
the
same
token,
and
we
have
absolutely
no
quarrel
with
the
idea
that
if
the
defendant
during
the
one
week
or
the
60
days
between
his
arrest
and
his
trial
attempted
a
jail
break,
i
don't
think
it
can
be
seriously
contended
that
that
is
not
evidence
relative
to
an
aspect
of
his
character
and
record
that
the
jury
ought
to
know
and
that
they
are
entitled
to
know,
and
indeed,
south
carolina
law
most
certainly
provides
for
consideration.
indeed,
in
this
record
there
is
the
slightest
fragment
of
rather
minor
misbehavior
which
was
admitted
to
by
the
defendant
himself
that
when
they
first
put
him
in
jail
he
banged
on
the
bars
because
they
wouldn't
let
him
get
a
phone
call,
and
the
solicitor
and
prosecutor
jumped
on
that,
seized
on
that
in
his
closing
argument.
he
said,
didn't
he
admit
kicking
on
the
bars
over
there.
that
is
the
kind
of
prisoner
he
is,
kicking
on
the
bars,
kicking
on
the
bars.
now,
there
was
nothing
improper
about
that
argument.
what
was
improper
about
it
is
that
ronald
skipper's
side
of
the
story
was
excluded
from
evidence,
and
that
is
all
the
jury
heard.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
well,
i
agree
with
that,
your
honor,
and
i
believe
that
is
exactly
what
defense
counsel
proffered
the
jailers
to
say,
that
after
this
initial
little
problem
he
had
the
night
he
was
locked
up,
he
made
a
good
adaptation
and
did
fine,
and
the
jury
could
fairly
have
concluded
from
that
that
he
would
have
done
all
right
if
they
spared
his
life
and
sent
him
to
prison,
and
that,
of
course,
is
the
testimony
the
jury
never
got
to
hear.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
yes,
your
honor,
only
two
points
which
i
would
like
to
touch
on
very
briefly.
one,
i
think
it
should
just
be
mentioned
that
what
the
state
now
argues
is
the
very
core
of
this
case,
and
their
entire
submission
is
a
point
never
before
raised
by
the
state
below.
it
is
not
until
the
state
came
to
this
court
that
it
asserted
for
the
first
time
that
all
that
was
being
offered
to
cite
what
the
record
clearly
shows
is
some
sort
of
incompetent
lay
opinion
testimony.
there
was
no
reason
for
the
state
to
make
any
such
argument,
because
south
carolina
law
is
so
clear
that
the
issue
of
future
conduct
in
prison
at
least
when
the
behavior
is
likely
to
be
good
is
inadmissible
as
a
matter
of
law
and
is
categorically
excluded.
that
is
what
state
against
koon
said,
the
exact
testimony
that
was
excluded
by
the
psychiatric
witness,
and
it
is
contained
in
justice
marshall's
opinion
in
patterson
versus
south
carolina
in
footnote
3.
the
expert
said,
i
conclude
that
koon
would
be
a
very
good
risk
for
good
adjustment
in
an
institution,
and
a
very
low
risk
for
assaultive
or
violent
behavior
in
an
institutional
setting.
i
don't
think
that
has
anything
to
do
with
how
often
he
would
have
taken
a
shower.
counsel
for
the
state
keeps
saying
over
and
over
again
in
his
argument
that
these
various
family
witnesses
were
permitted
to
testify,
and
he
notes
that
a
written
mitigating
circumstance
was
submitted
to
the
jury
dealing
with
future
conduct.
there
are
inconsistencies
in
the
trial
judges'
actions
in
this
case,
but
there
is
a
way
of
explaining
all
of
them.
that
which
was
objected
to
by
the
state
was
excluded.
there
was
no
objection
to
the
wife.
there
was
no
objection
to
the
defendant's
own
statements
on
the
witness
stand,
and
therefore
the
judge
let
it
in.
there
was
no
objection
to
the
written
mitigating
circumstance
that
was
submitted.
therefore
the
judge
submitted
it.
the
problem
with
the
written
mitigating
circumstance
is,
it
had
virtually
no
evidence
to
back
it
up.
the
prosecutor
is
the
one
who
made
use
of
that
bit
of
writing
in
the
sentencing
instructions,
because
he
gave
the
prosecutor
the
opening
for
his
extremely
effective
jury
argument
about,
if
you
send
this
fellow
to
prison,
he
is
going
to
rape
other
boy
inmates
in
the
jail,
because
that
is
the
kind
of
inmate
he
is,
and
you
know
that
based
on
what
you
know
about
him,
and
on
this
record.
that
is
why
there
was
no
objection.
i
don't
think
the
trial
judge
was
all
that
confused.
his
trial
judge
made
no
sui
sponte
rulings
that
i
am
aware
of
during
this
entire...
during
this
entire--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--well,
it
is
being
offered
to
prove
future
conduct,
his
past
conduct.
that
is
the
reason--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--the
main
point
i
really
got
to
my
feet
again
to
make
was
simply
in
the
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
questions
and
the
answers
to
justice
steven's
question
were
not
correct.
that
the
state
gave
the
law
in
south
carolina
could
not
be
clearer
that
the
issue
of
future
good
conduct
in
prison
is
inadmissible
as
a
matter
of
law.
in
this
case,
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
cited
koon
i
in
saying
that
evidence
of
future
adjustability
or
adaptability
to
prison
was
properly
excluded.
a
few
months
later,
in
state
against
elmore,
the
case...
the
south
carolina
court
made
an
identical
ruling
based
purely...
in
a
case
which
involved
only
the
exclusion
of
three
prison
guards
who
had
had
this
man
for
two
years,
and
when
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
upheld
the
exclusion
of
that
testimony,
solely
evidence
that
there
is
prior
good
conduct,
the
state
court
cited
state
against
skipper
as
their
authority,
so
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
about
what
south
carolina
law
is.
my
last
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
is
simply
that
the
state
in
a...
at
the
last
moment
said
that
the
evidence
here
is
harmless.
this
court
has
never
suggested
that
an
actual
violation
the
rule
of
lockett
against
ohio,
that
an
actual
exclusion
of
relevant
mitigating
evidence
can
ever
be...
if
there
ever
could
be
harmless
error,
that
is
to
say,
if
a
reviewing
court
were
ever
able
to
say
with
certainty
that
an
error
of
this
sort
could
not
have
affected
the
jury's
judgment,
surely
this
is
not
the
case.
for
all
we
know
based
on
this
record,
ronald
skipper
is
on
death
row
today
precisely
because
of
the
argument
that
the
state
made
which
he
was
prevented
from
responding
to
with
competent
evidence
and
the
state's
own
jailers
prepared,
ready,
and
willing
to
testify
on
his
behalf,
and
on
that
basis
we
submit
that
this
death
sentence
may
not
be
carried
out
consistent
with
the
commands
of
the
eighth
amendment.
thank
you.
