f.

i
am
not
clear
as
to
your
position
in
response
to
the
questions
that
have
been
asked.
in
this
case
the
prosecutor
injected
by
questions
he
asked
the
issue
of
conduct
in
prison.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
he
also
included
that
in
his
final
speech
to
the
jury.
suppose
the
prosecutor
had
not
done
either
of
those
things?
would,
under
your
presentation
here
today,
it
have
been
appropriate
for
counsel
for
the
defendant
to
have
introduced,
first
of
all,
psychiatric
testimony
as
to
the
likelihood
of
his
being
a
good
prisoner
for
the
long-term
future?
yes.
is
the
answer
to
that
yes?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
is
your
position?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
now,
let's
assume,
instead
of
having
psychiatric
testimony,
the
only
testimony
to
that
effect
came
from
the
two
prison
guards
and
from
the
woman
who
visited
the
prison
once
a
week.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
not
psychiatrists.
is
your
answer
still
yes?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
would
that
have
been
admissible?
it
is
purely
speculation
by
lay
people.
would
it
have
been
admissible?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
right,
but--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--you
offer
the
past
record
for
the
purpose
of
showing--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--the
likelihood
that
he
would
not
be
dangerous
in
the
future.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
now--
--if
this
ability
by...
excuse
me.
go
ahead.
testimony
by
prison
guards
would
have
been
admitted
for
that
purpose?
