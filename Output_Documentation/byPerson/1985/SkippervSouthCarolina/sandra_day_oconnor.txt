justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
bruck,
does
the
record
disclose
by
an
offer
of
proof
or
otherwise
exactly
what
it
is
that
the
evidence
of
the
two
corrections
officers,
if
that
is
what
we
are
dealing
with,
would
have
consisted
of?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
for
our
purposes,
we
should
consider
what
the
evidence
would
have
been
to
have
consisted
only
of
past
conduct
while
incarcerated,
is
that
correct,
without
an
element
of
prediction
of
future
conduct?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
under
present
south
carolina
law,
do
i
understand
correctly
that
the
state
would
now
permit
such
evidence
to
be
introduced?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
mr.
bruck
said
this
morning
before
noon.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
page
is
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
coombs,
suppose,
just
suppose
that
all
that
they
wanted
to
offer
was
the
testimony
of
the
corrections
officers
about
past
conduct
while
in
jail?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
pardon
me?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
would
it
be
admissible
for
the
purpose
of
proving
future
adjustability
to
prison
life?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
didn't
answer
my
question.
would
the
evidence
of
past
conduct
in
prison
be
admissible
to
prove
adjustability
and
behavior
in
the
future
while
in
prison
in
south
carolina?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
and
yet
the
judge
kept
it
out
here
even
in
the
face
of
arguments
by
the
prosecutor
that
this
man
would
be
likely
to
attack
other
prisoners
in
the
future
and
behave
badly
in
prison.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
isn't
that
the
prosecutor's
argument
at
the
end?
doesn't
it
touch
in
part
upon
the
likelihood
that
this
man
would
attack
other
prisoners
in
the
future,
and
that
he
is
likely
to
misbehave
in
prison?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
don't
you
think
that
it
is
arguable
that
the
defendant
should
have
been
allowed
to
rebut
that
inference
with
testimony
of
this
type
from
corrections
officers?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
are
you
arguing
that
the
error
was
harmless?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
counsel,
wasn't
the
evidence
excluded
in
koon
i
evidence
of
an
expert?
wasn't
it
psychiatric
testimony?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
wasn't
lay
testimony.
