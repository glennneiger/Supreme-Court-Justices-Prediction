mr.
richard
l.
epstein
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
may
i
take
the
opportunity
first
to
present
a
brief
overview
of
the
three
basic
points
that
i
wish
to
make.
the
first
is
that
a
decision
to
withhold
medical
treatment
in
a
specific
individual
case,
while
it
may
constitute
unlawful
medical
neglect
at
its
worst
under
the
laws
of
all
of
the
states,
it
cannot
constitute
discrimination
under
section
504
of
the
rehabilitation
act.
our
anti-discrimination
laws,
our
view
of
discrimination,
concerns
the
disparate
treatment
of
people
according
to
categories
or
classifications,
such
as
race
and
sex
and
age.
medical
treatment
decisions
do
not
constitute
disparate
treatment
by
category,
but
rather
are
based
on
the
medical
treatment
needs
of
the
individual,
and
no
two
persons'
needs
are
the
same.
second,
in
the
face
of
the
government's
struggle,
if
you
will,
to
divine
congressional
authority
for
its
regulations
under
section
504,
the
child
abuse
act
amendments
of
1984
demonstrate
to
us
two
things:
first,
that
congress
has
the
capacity
to
speak
clearly
to
this
issue
when
it
so
desires;
and
that
when
in
fact
it
did
so
in
the
fall
of
1984,
congress
acted
to
reaffirm
the
primacy
of
state
regulation.
and
lastly
in
this
overview,
may
i
suggest
that
under
the
government's
asserted
view
that
medical
treatment
of
every
seriously
ill
hospitalized
person
is
a
matter
for
potential
intervention
under
section
504,
and
every
such
individual's
treatment
choices
could
thereby
be
subject
to
federal
scrutiny.
the
vehicle,
the
vehicle
that
the
department
sought
to
employ
for
statutory
authority
to
enter
the
neonatal
intensive
care
unit
of
a
hospital
nursery
where
critically
ill
newborns
are
being
medically
attended
by
teams
of
pediatricians
and
other
specialized
physicians
and
their
devoted
parents,
was
section
504.
we
do
not
agree
that
congress
acted
to
confer
that
authority.
in
grasping
at
section
504
for
its
alleged
authority,
it
was
necessary
for
the
department
to
characterize
the
parental
responsibility
for
making
private
choices
as
acts
of
alleged
discrimination.
but
the
fact
is
that
the
activities
of
analyzing,
the
activities
of
monitoring
and
choosing
and
medically
attending
infants
afflicted
with
severe
illnesses
are
not
matters
of
discrimination.
these
illnesses
include
such
things
as
low
birth
weight,
respiratory
distress
syndrome,
compromised--
mr.
richard
l.
epstein
--not
under
our
interpretation
of
discrimination.
what
there
may
have
been
at
worst--
mr.
richard
l.
epstein
--justice
o'connor,
in
the
case
of
the
bloomington
episode,
at
worst
there
may
have
been
what
would
be
a
case
of
medical
neglect
which
is
cognizable
under
the
child
abuse
amendments
of
1984,
which
is
their
very
purpose.
mr.
richard
l.
epstein
not,
i
would
suggest,
if
the
rehabilitation
act
of
1973,
which
is
what
we
contend,
does
not
apply
to
cases
of
medical
treatment
decisionmaking,
and
that's
where
504
is
to
be
found.
if
we
can't
connect
it--
mr.
richard
l.
epstein
--if
we
get
into
that
posture,
which
could
have
been
the
case
in
bloomington,
and
that
is
where
the
administrator
of
the
hospital,
who
was
in
disagreement
with
the
parents'
refusal
to
provide
consent,
had
after
the
appointment
of
the
guardian
had
a
different
result
in
the
process
of
moving
the
matter
along,
where
ultimately
it
was
decided,
not
by
a
child
abuse
agency,
but
by
the
courts
in
indiana,
that
the
decision
that
was
made
on
the
basis
of
the
record
that
that
court
had
privy
to
was
one
that
was
reasonable;
and
so
the
final
decision
that
was
made
there
was
one
by
the
courts.
now,
this
does
not
of
course
preclude
the
child
abuse
protective
agency
under
the
present
regime
and
under
the
amendments
of
1984
from
monitoring
and
being
intimately
involved
in
any
case...
and
this
indeed
is
their
responsibility,
justice
o'connor...
to
intimately
involve
themselves
in
any
cases
of
medical
neglect.
mr.
richard
l.
epstein
in
the
sense
that,
in
the
sense
that,
section
504
we
maintain
was
promulgated
without
authority
from
the
congress,
and
so
in
that
sense
it
is
a
facial
challenge.
and
any
regulation
which
is
promulgated
without
authority
would
lend
itself
to
being
vulnerable
to
the
same
kind
of
challenge.
mr.
richard
l.
epstein
we
believe
that
that
interpretation
rests
with
the
judiciary,
your
honor,
and
not
with
an
agency,
which
may
embark
on
its
own--
mr.
richard
l.
epstein
--not
in
all
circumstances,
your
honor,
and
certainly
not
in
a
situation
where
an
agency
has
undertaken,
as
in
this
case
in
1982,
on
a
directive
to
promulgate
a
regulation
to
regulate
medical
treatment
to
severely
ill
newborns,
and
reached
out
for
some
kind
of
statutory
nexus
on
which
to
allegedly
hang
that
claimed
authority,
and
used
section
504
in
the
process.
somebody
needs
to
monitor
that
kind
of
endeavor
by
any
department.
it's
our
position
that
in
grasping
at
504
that
it
sought
to
cloak
itself
with
the
authority
of
a
statute
which
didn't
grant
that
authority
to
the
department.
we
are
dealing,
as
i
have
pointed
out,
with
examples
of
severely
ill
newborns,
and
among
those
were
the
examples
that
i
have
mentioned,
which
include
in
addition
meningitis,
spinal
bifida,
malformed
brain
stem,
and
a
variety
of
countless
forms
in
which
these
illnesses
may
combine.
and
they
are
not
matters
of
discrimination,
if
you
please;
they
are
matters
of
medical
care
and
guidance
and
parental
choice
concerning
and
individual
infant.
our
awareness
of
these
conditions,
their
variety,
their
occurrence
in
different
combinations,
and
their
differences
in
degree
of
severity,
underscore
the
human
being's
maladies,
and
the
critical
need
to
attend
each
case
in
an
intensively
individualistic
manner.
discrimination
has
been
viewed
in
our
society
or
by
the
congress.
in
conclusion,
the
respondents
would
be
remiss
if
they
failed
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
an
additional
and
i
believe
compelling
consideration
to
help
guide
us
in
this
complex
arena.
were
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
to
be
reversed,
the
federal
regulatory
agencies
might
conclude
that
in
promulgating
regulations
they
need
not
be
confined
to
the
four
corners
of
the
authorizing
statute
or
the
congressional
intent
behind
it.
let
me
be
specific
and
illustrate
that.
suppose
in
the
case
of
a
reversal
of
the
court
below
the
department
of
health
and
human
services
would
go
next
to
the
other
end
of
life's
spectrum
and
go
from
the
neonatal
intensive
care
unit
to
the
geriatric
ward
to
review
how
families
and
appointed
surrogates
of
elderly
incompetent
patients
and
their
physicians
are
implementing
state-authorized
living
wills
in
performing
their
private
and
familial
duties.
indeed,
every
seriously
ill
hospitalized
patient
could
fall
within
the
reach
of
the
department's
view
of
handicap,
and
every
medical
treatment
decision,
every
medical
treatment
decision,
could
be
subject
thereby
to
departmental
scrutiny.
mr.
richard
l.
epstein
the
regulations
endeavor
to
apply
to
severely
ill
newborns.
we
do
not
equate
handicap
with
the
severe
illnesses
that
we
are
talking
about,
and
we're
talking
about
cases
of
medical
treatment
of
medical
neglect,
which
is
scrutinized
at
the
state
level
by
the
appropriate
state
agency.
mr.
richard
l.
epstein
beyond
the
reach
of
which
act,
your
honor?
mr.
richard
l.
epstein
there
are
protections
for
persons
in
the
regulatory
scheme
under
the
act,
for
persons
to
have
access
to
hospitals,
to
health
services,
to
care.
but
nowhere
there,
and
not
even
in
the
medicare
statute,
is
there
any
allowance
for
the
department
or
for
any
federal
agency
to
get
involved
with
the
decisions
that
are
characterized
as
the
medical
treatment
decisionmaking.
mr.
richard
l.
epstein
that
is
correct.
this
court
has
clearly
held
that
the
principles
of
statutory
construction
demonstrate
that,
in
view
of
the
comprehensive
regulation
of
the
field
by
the
states,
congressional
authority
should
not
be
imputed
without
a
clear
indication
of
a
congressional
intent
to
do
so.
that
clear
expression
of
intent
is
not
present
in
this
case.
for
these
reasons,
the
respondents
respectfully
request
that
the
court
hold
section
504
not
applicable
to
cases
of
medical
treatment
for
severely
ill
newborns,
and
further
respectfully
requests
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
be
affirmed.
