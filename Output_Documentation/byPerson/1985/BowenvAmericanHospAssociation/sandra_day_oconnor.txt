mr.
cooper,
is
it
true
that
the
administrative
record
doesn't
have
any
examples
in
it
of
a
hospital
which
has
refused
to
treat
a
handicapped
infant
when
the
parents
have
consented
to
treatment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
what
you're
really
concerned
about
and
what
the
record
supports,
i
suppose,
is
cases
when
the
parents
have
refused
to
give
consent
to
treatment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
these
are
guidelines,
are
they
not?
are
they
the
same
as
a
regulation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
a
rule?
i
mean,
what
are
they?
what
are
we
really
looking
at?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
they've
been
adopted
in
accordance
with
the
administrative
procedures
act?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
posting
of
a
notice
and
the
right
to
get
records.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
real
focus
actually
is
on
situations
where
parents
have
refused
to
give
consent
to
treatment,
and
in
that
context
would
you
explain
how
the
regulations
operate
and
how
you
see
the
application
of
the
act?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
has
been
the
practice
in
the
50
states
with
regard
to
situations
that
you're
concerned
about,
to
wit
the
parents
refuse
treatment,
the
doctor
agrees
no
treatment
will
be
provided,
the
hospital
says
no
treatment.
are
child
protective
agencies
likely
to
intervene
in
those
situations
as
a
matter
of
state
law?
what's
happening?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
presumably
you've
researched
and
you
can
tell
us
what
is
effect
is
happening
in
the
various
states
in
this
regard.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
have
you
said
all
you
intend
to
say
about
the
application
of
the
guidelines
in
the
circumstances
we
were
discussing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
as
a
practical
matter,
what
is
likely
to
happen
if
the
regulations
are
upheld?
i
assume,
because
you've
already
said,
that
the
main
focus
is
on
cases
where
the
parents
have
refused
to
permit
treatment.
and
in
those
circumstances,
the
government
wants
to
be
able
to
examine
the
hospital
records
to
see
whether
the
government
is
satisfied
that
there
is
a
valid
medical
reason
for
refusing
the
treatment,
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
if
the
government
thinks
there
is
not
a
valid
reason
for
refusing
the
treatment,
the
government
would
think
that
the
hospital
would
have
to
refer
the
case
to
the
state
child
abuse
agency?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if
the
hospital
just
made
a
blanket
practice
of
referring
all
such
cases
to
the
appropriate
state
agency?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
regardless
of
whether
the
state
agency
wants
to
take
any
action
on
the
situation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
the
end
of
it
as
far
as
the
federal
government
is
concerned,
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
your
position
was
that
the
violation
was
in
not
reporting
it
to
the
state
agency.
at
least
that's
what
you
had
told
me
in
response
to
my
question.
are
you
saying
something
else
to
justice
stevens?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
said
that
the
law
in
all
50
states
requires
the
hospital
to
be
set
up
to
do
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right,
so
it's
your
position
that
what
the
hospital
must
do
is
refer
it
to
the
child
abuse
agency.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
except
that
i
thought
you
said
if
the
state
child
protective
services
agency
did
not
employ
the
standard
that
the
federal
government
thinks
is
appropriate,
the
federal
government
would
then
withhold
funds
from
the
child
protective
services
agency.
so
if
the
federal
government
doesn't
agree
with
what
the
child
protective
services
agency
does,
it
will
try
to
withhold
funds.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
epstein,
at
least
in
the
bloomington
case,
don't
you
think
it's
at
least
possible
to
say
that
there
was
some
kind
of
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
handicap
there?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
language
of
504
is
broad,
and
it
would
seem
to
me
you
have
to
come
to
grips
with
the
fact
that
the
language
could
be
interpreted
as
the
government
suggests.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
also
could
theoretically
be
discrimination
within
the
meaning
of
section
504,
viewed
in
its
broad
provisions.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
normally
the
court
would
at
least
defer
to
any
reasonable
interpretation
by
the
administrative
agency
charged
with
the
enforcement
of
the
statute.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
of
course,
here
we're
dealing
i
suppose
with
a
facial
challenge,
in
effect,
to
the
application
of
section
504
to
any
conceivable
situation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
think
that
we
should
not
look
at
the
interpretation
by
the
agency
charged
with
its
enforcement
in
helping
us
know
whether
the
statute
is
applicable?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
doesn't
the
court
normally
defer
to
a
reasonable
interpretation
by
the
agency?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
heineman,
it
does
strike
me
that
the
respondents
in
this
case
just
aren't
coming
to
grips
with
what
might
be
of
real
concern
to
us,
and
that
is
the
breadth
of
the
language,
the
fact
that
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
expressly
says
congress
did
not
intend
to
cover
this
area,
and
the
fact
that
we
normally
defer
to
the
administrative
agency's
interpretation.
and
it's
all
well
and
good
to
parade
a
series
of
horrible
examples
before
the
court,
but
i
wonder
how
we
deal
with
it
in
terms
of
our
normal
application
of
interpretation
of
statutes
and
deference
to
agency
interpretation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
government
says
it
has
cited
studies
that
are
supportive
of
its
concern
in
this
area.
now,
what
if
the
hospital
or
the
physicians
just
made
a
routine
policy
of
referring
cases
of
non-consent
by
parents
to
the
appropriate
state
agency?
doesn't
that
solve
any
federal
concern?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
there's
no
evidence
in
the
statute,
the
legislative
history,
that
affirmatively
says
congress
did
not
intend
to
reach
that,
is
there?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there's
just
an
absence
of
a
focus
on
it.
there's
broad
language
in
the
statute,
so
it
isn't
an
easy
case,
is
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if
the
hospital
and
the
medical
treatment
personnel
just
took
the
position
that
in
every
case
of
a
newborn
with
down
syndrome
they're
not
going
to
under
any
circumstances
refer
a
refusal
to
treat
to
a
child
protective
services
agency?
is
that
denial
of
access
to
medical
treatment
within
the
meaning
of
section
504?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
let's
just
assume
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
we
have
a
facial
challenge
here.
we
don't
have
any
specific
cases
before
us.
we
just
have
a
facial
challenge.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
the
judgment
below
was
that
504
just
didn't
authorize
any
of--
