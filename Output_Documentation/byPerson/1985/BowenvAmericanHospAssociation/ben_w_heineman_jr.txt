mr.
ben
w.
heineman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
judgment
below
enjoins
the
secretary
from
using
section
504
to
investigate
and
regulate
directly
individual
treatment
decisions
relating
to
severely
impaired
newborns.
there
are
three
types
of
treatment
decisions
at
issue
in
this
case:
decisions
by
parents
not
to
consent
to
treatment;
decisions
by
providers
when
parents
do
not
consent;
and
decisions
by
providers
when
parents
do
consent,
which
was
raised
really
for
the
first
time
in
brief
to
this
court
by
the
government,
and
on
which
mr.
cooper
conceded
in
the
answer
to
justice
o'connor
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
that
providers
do
not
give
treatment
when
parents
consent
to
it.
state
child
abuse
and
neglect
laws
have
historically
regulated
the
first
two
decisions
and
addressed
the
vexing
and
sensitive
questions
of
when
states
should
override
parents'
treatment
decisions
for
their
children
and
when
physicians
should
come
between
parent
and
child
under
state
law
and
report
to
state
authorities
parents
for
possible
medical
neglect.
the
secretary's
intrusive
regulatory
regime,
which
is
not
discussed
in
the
briefs
and
which
mr.
cooper
did
not
discuss
before
this
court
today,
has
been
aimed
exclusively
at
these
two
treatment
decisions
historically
regulated
by
the
states.
most
strikingly.
hhs
has
initiated
at
least
49
direct
federal
investigations,
including
17
onsite
inquiries,
to
see
if
parent
and
physician
decisions
are
correct
under
state
law.
these
highly
intrusive
investigations,
which
have
found
no
504
violations,
come
at
a
time
when
parents
and
physicians
are
struggling
with
traumatic
and
highly
complex
issues.
the
government's
briefs
are
striking
in
their
failure
to
cite
any
legislative
history
that
congress
when
it
enacted
504
intended
federal
officials
to
supplant
the
state
child
abuse
and
neglect
system
and
themselves
determine,
using
state
law
standards,
whether
parents'
refusal
to
authorize
treatment
and
providers'
response
to
that
refusal
are
correct.
mr.
ben
w.
heineman,
jr.
there
are
substantial
reasons
not
to
defer
to
the
agency
in
this
case,
justice
o'connor.
there
are
at
least
four.
there
is
a
fundamental
test
when
we
are
construing
504,
announced
for
this
court
by
justice
marshall
in
alexander
v.
choate,
about
whether
the
modification
in
the
recipient's
program
is
substantial
or
reasonable.
federal
baby
doe
squads
arriving
in
the
hours
after
birth
is
a
substantial
modification
of
the
program.
there's
a
second
rule
of
construction.
the
agency
will
have
leeway
to
regulate
when
it
has
shown
a
particularly
significant
problem.
there
is
to
administrative
record
in
this
case
that
the
state
system
is
not
effectively
monitoring
any
problem
of
reporting.
i
said
there
were
three
kinds
of
decisions:
decisions
of
parents:
the
government
concedes
that
parents
are
not
federal
fund
recipients
and
their
decisions
cannot
be
directly
regulated.
decisions
of
providers
when
parents
do
consent
to
treatment.
mr.
cooper
effectively
conceded
just
a
few
minutes
ago
that
there's
nothing
in
the
administrative
record
saying
that
that
is
ever
a
problem.
they've
never
cited
a
single
instance
of
failure
by
a
physician
to
provide
once
there
has
been
a
consent
by
the
parent,
although
that
is
basically
the
way
their
brief
is
written
to
this
court.
that
leaves
then
the
question,
because
the
final
judgment
regulates
treatment
decisions,
it
doesn't
regulate
child
protective
service
agencies.
it
regulates
treatment
decisions
by
parents
and
providers.
that
leaves
the
question
then
of
what
providers
are
supposed
to
do
when
there
is
a
lack
of
consent
by
parents.
the
government
has
shown
no
significant
problem,
pursuant
to
the
rule
of
construction
in
alexander
v.
choate,
with
respect
to
that
situation.
moreover--
mr.
ben
w.
heineman,
jr.
--yes,
yes.
but
if
i
may
speak
to
those
studies,
they
go
to
what
doctors
may
or
may
not
do.
they
do
not
go
to
the
fundamental
question
here
of
whether
there
is
any
problem
with
the
states
not
effectively
monitoring
doctor
decisions.
there's
a
third
reason,
beside
these
two
rules
of
504
construction,
why
no
deference
would
go
to
the
agency
here,
and
that
is
the
fundamental
rule
of
general
electric
versus
gilbert
about
inconsistent
agency
interpretation.
as
i
indicated,
what
we're
talking
about
here
precisely,
the
hook
on
which
the
federal
government
tries
to
get
into
these
intensive
care
nurseries,
is
where
parents
haven't
consented
what
is
the
responsibility
of
the
provider?
in
1982
when
the
notice
was
first
put
out
on
this
subject,
they
said
the
responsibility
of
the
provider
was
to
discharge
the
infant
from
the
hospital.
there
was
an
outcry
about
this,
because
that
would
obviously
be
inhumane
and
incorrect.
in
1983
when
they
put
out
an
interim
finial
regulation,
they
said
the
responsibility
of
the
provider
was
to
override
the
treatment
decision
of
the
parents
and
provide
treatment,
neglecting
the
fact
that,
as
i
think
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
that
would
of
course
be
a
battery.
so
by
the
time
they
got
to
put
out
the
final
req,
they
then
go
to
this
question
of
whether
they
can
investigate
whether
providers
are
discharging
their
state
law
reporting
duties.
we
also
indicate
in
our
brief
at
great
length
why
this
is
not
an
appropriate
area
for
the
federal
government
to
be
in,
because
state
law
reporting
duties
are
state
law
reporting
duties.
they
are
the
responsibility
of
a
state
to
monitor
and
enforce,
and
absent
a
clear
showing...
again,
there's
a
long
line
of
cases
that
we
cite
in
our
brief.
absent
a
clear
showing
by
the
congress--
mr.
ben
w.
heineman,
jr.
--i
disagree
with
that.
what
is
in
the
record
are
some
old
studies,
at
least
eight
to
ten
years
old,
discussing
physician
attitudes,
not
specific
cases,
and
never
addressing
the
question
of
whether
the
state
child
abuse
and
neglect
system
was
functioning
correctly.
those
are
strictly
attitudinal
studies
of
physicians.
they
are
not
real
cases,
and
they
do
not
address
the
fundamental
question
of
whether
or
not
the
state
system
is
not
functioning
correctly.
but
in
any
event,
there
is
a
fundamental
rule
of
construction
here
that,
where
the
federal
government
is
coming
in
to
enforce
state
law...
in
other
words,
what
the
federal
government
is
purporting
to
do
when
it
comes
into
these
hospitals
is
to
see
if
the
providers
are
discharging
their
state
law
duties,
duties
established
under
child
abuse
and
neglect
statutes
by
state
law
to
report.
they
are
seeking
to
enforce
those
duties,
to
see
if
there
is
in
fact
liability.
that
is
preeminently
the
function
of
state
authorities,
not
federal
authorities.
mr.
ben
w.
heineman,
jr.
i'm
saying
that
there
should
be
no
deference,
for
a
variety
of
reasons.
mr.
ben
w.
heineman,
jr.
yes,
again,
justice
white,
the
final
judgment
here
goes
to
three
kinds
of
decisions:
parents,
but
basically
they
have
conceded
that
parents
are
not
federal
fund
recipients.
mr.
ben
w.
heineman,
jr.
and
then
provider
decisions
when
parents
do
consent.
so
the
only
issue
is
the
provider
response
when
parents
do
not
consent,
and
that
is
a
state
law
duty
which
the
states
should
monitor.
so
that
is
why
in
this
context--
mr.
ben
w.
heineman,
jr.
--that's
correct.
we
have
no...
i
have
no
question
about
that,
and
i
think
if
i
may--
mr.
ben
w.
heineman,
jr.
--no,
that
is
correct.
mr.
ben
w.
heineman,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
is
an
easy
case
if
we
take
the
proper
steps,
in
this
sense,
that
when
504
was
enacted
in
1973
it
was
aimed
at
employment
and
education,
and
that
there
was...
congress
made
detailed
findings
that
there
was
handicap
problems
in
those
areas
in
the
states.
the
states
have
historically
regulated
medical
care.
there
has
never
been
any
findings
by
the
congress
that
there
was
discrimination
in
individual
treatment
cases
that
warranted
a
federal
involvement.
and
if
i
might
go
to
justice
white's
question
a
moment
ago,
the
bottom
line
question
in
this
case
is
who
should
decide,
and
i
believe
you
asked
that,
who
should
decide
whether
individual
treatment
decisions
are
correct?
should
the
federal
government
and
hhs
for
the
first
time
in
our
history,
going
back
to
justice
marshall's
point--
mr.
ben
w.
heineman,
jr.
--no,
i
believe
that
what
i
have
to
do
is
say
that
the
law
does
not
authorize
it
clearly,
to
be
sure.
the
legislative
history,
the
examples
in
the
legislative
history,
speak
only
to
access
to
health
facilities.
they
do
not
remotely
touch
the
question
of
the
federal
government
making
individualized
treatment
decisions.
mr.
ben
w.
heineman,
jr.
correct.
mr.
ben
w.
heineman,
jr.
yes,
and
the
legislative
history
narrows
it
by
indicating
that
when
they
were
talking
about
health
services
they
were
only
talking
about
access
to
health
facilities.
there's
only
one
reference,
specific
reference
in
the
1974
senate
report,
which
is
the
only
congressional
legislative
history
on
the
question
of
what
"health
services"
means,
and
that
relates
to
admission
to
a
nursing
home
for
handicapped
individuals.
it
speaks
nothing
about
an
area
historically
regulated
by
the
state.
but
i
would
then
get,
of
course,
to
the
rules
of
construction,
and
there
are
a
number
of
rules
of
construction,
as
we
indicate
in
our
brief,
and
at
least
four
as
to
why
this
regulation
is
clearly
invalid
under
504
rules
of
construction.
mr.
ben
w.
heineman,
jr.
the
only
duty
of
the
physician
in
those
circumstances
under
state
law
is
to
report
the
parents
to
the
state
child
abuse
and
neglect
agency
for
possibly
being
guilty
of
medical
neglect,
medical
neglect
meaning--
mr.
ben
w.
heineman,
jr.
--that
is
correct.
it
is
not
authorized
to
investigate
that
decision
by
the
physician,
which
is
a
state
law
duty,
to
see
whether
the
physician
is
discharging
his
state
law
duty,
that's
correct,
justice
powell.
let
me
say
also
that
justice
o'connor
asked
the
question
of
whether
the
baby
doe
of
indiana
case
possibly
raised
a
question
of
discrimination
under
504.
i
think
justice
stevens
asked
a
similar
question
and
mr.
cooper
indicated
that
the
answer
was
clearly
no,
and
the
reason
it
was
clearly
no
is
that
the
parents
didn't
consent
to
treatment.
the
hospital
took
the
parents
to
state
court.
a
state
court
decided
that
the
parents
had
made
a
decision
which
was
in
the
reasonable
range
of
discretion.
a
county
prosecutor
then
brought
a
second
suit,
and
the
state
courts
decided
again
that
the
parents
had
made
a
reasonable
choice.
so
that
is
that
instance
there
is--
mr.
ben
w.
heineman,
jr.
--if
it
was
a
general
policy--
mr.
ben
w.
heineman,
jr.
--yes,
again,
i
have
a
hard
time
assuming
it
since
physicians
and
parents
are
basically
in
the
business
of
helping
children,
not
trying
not
to
help
them.
but
that
kind
of
generalized
policy,
stated
as
a
policy,
might
give
rise
to
a
504
violation.
but
that's
not
here,
and
that
i
don't
think
is
affected
by
the...
i
don't
think
that's
affected
by
the
judgment
below.
mr.
ben
w.
heineman,
jr.
right.
the
holding
below,
which
basically
animates
the
judgment,
the
holding
below
is
that
it
has
no
authority
to
investigate
and
regulate
individual
treatment
decisions.
that's
what
we're
talking
about
here.
that's
what
the
final
judgment's
about,
individual
treatment
decisions.
mr.
ben
w.
heineman,
jr.
investigation
and
regulation
of
individual
treatment
decisions
relating
to
the
severely
impaired
newborns.
mr.
ben
w.
heineman,
jr.
right,
individual
treatment
decisions.
mr.
ben
w.
heineman,
jr.
well,
i
would
be...
yes,
i
would
be
prepared
to
defend
it,
but
that
is
not
what
we
believe
the
judgment
below
is
about.
