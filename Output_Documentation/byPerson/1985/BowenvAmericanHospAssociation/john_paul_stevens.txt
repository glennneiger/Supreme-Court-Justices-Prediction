justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
cooper,
may
i
ask
you,
with
regard
to
that
particular
case,
if
the
regulations
under
review
today
had
been
in
place
at
that
time,
would
anything
different
have
happened?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there
was
no
violation?
that
course
of
conduct
involved
in
that
case
would
have
gone
on
exactly
the
same
way?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
if
you
have
the
regulations
at
all,
we'd
have
precisely
the
same
problem
that
gave
rise
to
the
regulations?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
cooper,
may
i
interrupt.
you
say
if
the
decision
was
made.
suppose
the
decision
was
made
by
the
parents
simply
because
the
child
had
the
handicap.
that's
the
reason
for
the
decision
by
the
parents,
but
the
reason
for
the
decision
by
the
hospital
was
that
the
parents
had
made...
had
refused.
does
that
violate
the
statute
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
that
they
couldn't
yield
to
the
parents'
decision?
what
should
they
do
absent
parental
consent
if
they
think
the
parents
have
decided
for
an
incorrect
reason?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
suppose
that,
what
if
the
doctor
agrees
with
the
decision
of
the
parents?
the
hospital
will
go
ahead
and
perform
the
service
anyway?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
supposing
they
agree
with
that,
but
they
have
a
general
hospital
policy
of
never
allowing
surgery
absent
parental
consent?
where
is
the
discrimination?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
it's
valid...
even
if
medical
people
could
disagree
on
whether
it's
proper
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
i'm
asking
what
is
the
violation
of
federal
law.
we're
not
concerned
with
a
violation
of
state
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
record,
the
administrative
record,
contain
any
instances
of
discriminatory
non-reporting
of
this
kind?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
just
to
clarify,
you
say
the
administrative
record
contains
reference
to
examples
of
discriminatory
nonreporting
of
this
kind.
how
many
such
examples
in
the
record?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
was
asking
about
discriminatory...
the
focus
of
the
regulations
as
i
understood
is
to
be
sure
that
these
cases
are
properly
reported,
that
they
report
the
handicapped
child's
case
as
well
as
the
non-handicapped
child's
case,
the
same
rule
is
applied
to
both.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
was
asking
you
if
there
are
examples,
and
if
so
how
many,
of
cases
in
which
hospitals
have
failed
to
report
cases
of
this
kind,
but
they
report
cases
of
other
kinds.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
cooper
indicated
that
the
administrative
record
shows
that
there
was
a
substantial
problem
of
non-reporting
of
cases
in
this
category,
as
opposed
to
other
cases.
do
you
agree
with
that?
