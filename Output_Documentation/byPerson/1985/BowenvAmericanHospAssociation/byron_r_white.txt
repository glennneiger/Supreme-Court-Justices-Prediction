justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
also
the
case
where
the
doctor
agrees
with
the
parents,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
can
tell
us
about
both
of
those
situations,
then.
and
tell
us,
if
you
will,
whether
you
think
that
under
the
statute
the
child
is
otherwise
qualified
for
treatment
when
the
parent
has
refused
to
give
consent
and
therefore
it
would
be
a
battery
for
the
doctor
or
the
hospital
to
give
treatment.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
haven's
finished
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor,
have
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
otherwise,
and
if
they
don't,
it's
discrimination
because
in
non-handicap
situations
they
must
under
state
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
they
treat
the
handicaps
different,
your
position
is
that's
discrimination?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
the
regulations
now,
who's
going
to
finally
make
the
decision
about
whether
there's
been
discrimination
against
the
handicapped?
it's
reported
to
the
state
agency
and
then
what
happens?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
who
disagrees
with
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
what
if
it
decides
that
it's
within
the
scope
of?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
the
end
of
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
if
the
review
committee
disagrees,
it
goes
to
the
agency?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
what
happens?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
and
what
if
they
disagree
with
the
hospital,
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
they
go
to
state
court
on
it,
they're
applying
a
federal
standard,
aren't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
is
a
federal
standard
provided
that
either
must
be
satisfied
or
funds
are
withheld?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
how
do
you
tell
about
discrimination?
you
are
looking
over
their
shoulders
as
to
what
standard
a
doctor
uses
or
the
hospital
uses
for
withholding
treatment.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
right
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
has
been
discrimination,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
your
submission
that
these
regulations
may
not
validly
apply
to
any
handicapped
person,
any
medical
decision
to
treat
a
handicapped
person,
whether
it's
baby
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
wouldn't
think
that
the
medical
treatment
of
just
any
handicapped
person
is
beyond
the
reach
of
the
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
act
that
title
4
was
passed
under.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
say
that
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference.
your
position
is
that
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
how
old
the
handicapped
person
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what's
your
bottom
line?
are
you
just
talking
about
whether
there
should
be
deference?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
there
shouldn't
be
any
deference.
you
still
have
to
conclude
that
the
regulation
is
outside
the
reach
of
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
still
have
to
conclude
that
congress
just
flatly
didn't
intend
to
reach
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
may
be
a
good
question
for
congress.
but
you
still
have
to
convince
us
that
congress
intended
to
exclude
any
medical
decisions
about
handicaps,
handicapped
people.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
do
have,
just
by
way
of
silence,
to
narrow
the
reach
of
the
language
that
forbids
discrimination
against
the
handicapped.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
--at
least
that's
the
way
you
interpret
the
decision
below,
and
that's
all
you're
defending?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
it's
any
broader
than
that
you
don't
defend
it?
