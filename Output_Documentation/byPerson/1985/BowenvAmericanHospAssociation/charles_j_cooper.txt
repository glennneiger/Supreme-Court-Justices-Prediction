mr.
charles
j.
cooper
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
section
504
of
the
rehabilitation
act
of
1973
prohibits
a
federally
assisted
hospital
from
withholding
nourishment
or
medically
beneficial
treatment
from
a
handicapped
infant
solely
because
of
that
individual's
handicap.
the
court
of
appeals,
relying
on
an
earlier
ruling
in
the
university
hospital
case,
held
that
section
504
has
no
application
in
this
setting
at
all,
no
matter
what
the
circumstances,
and
therefore
invalidated
on
their
face
the
interpretive
guidelines
and
procedural
regulations
issued
by
the
secretary
to
explain
the
application
of
section
504
in
this
setting.
in
so
doing,
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
a
nationwide
injunction
that
prohibited
the
secretary
from
taking
any
action
whatsoever,
investigatory
or
otherwise,
in
an
effort
to
enforce
section
504's
non-discriminatory
mandate
in
this
setting.
now,
there
is
no
question
presented
in
this
case
concerning
the
application
of
section
504
to
any
particular
set
of
facts
or
circumstances.
rather,
this
case
concerns
only
the
facial
validity
of
the
secretary's
regulation.
now,
it
is
our
submission
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
clearly
incorrect
in
concluding
that
all
handicapped
individuals
who
are
infants
are
as
a
matter
of
law
outside
the
scope
of
section
504
protection
insofar
as
furnishing
nourishment
and
lifesaving
medically
beneficial
treatment
are
concerned.
therefore,
we
urge
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
due
to
be
reversed.
now,
as
i
shall
explain,
the
language
of
section
504
plainly
prohibits
a
federally
assisted
hospital
program
from
discriminating
on
the
basis
of
handicap
is
this,
as
well
as
in
any
other
context
concerning
a
covered
federally
funded
health
services
program.
and,
contrary
to
the
respondents'
claims,
there
is
firm
support
for
this
position
at
every
stage
of
section
504's
evolution,
from
its
origins
in
title
6
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act,
through
its
enactment
in
1973
and
its
amendments
in
1974
and
1978.
the
secretary's
construction
of
section
504
is
also
supported
through
a
consistent
administrative
construction.
turning
first
to
the
text
of
the
act,
section
504
provides
in
pertinent
part
as
follows:
"no
otherwise
qualified
handicapped
individual
in
the
united
states
shall,
solely
by
reason
of
his
handicap,
be
excluded
from
participation
in,
be
denied
the
benefits
of,
or
be
subjected
to
discrimination
under,
any
program
or
activity
receiving
federal
financial
assistance.
"
now,
this
language
is
majestic
in
its
sweep,
as
one
member
of
this
court
described
the
almost
identical
language
of
title
6
of
the
'64
civil
rights
act,
which
was
the
model
for
section
504.
and
this
court
also
noted
in
the
grove
city
case
recently
that
it
is
very
reluctant
to
read
into
the
largely
identical
language
of
title
9,
involved
in
grove
city,
a
limitation
not
apparent
on
the
face
of
the
language.
and
it
is
with
these
principles
in
mind
that
we
are
met
at
the
threshold
by
respondent
american
hospital
association,
who
argues
that
a
handicapped
infant
is
not
a
handicapped
individual
within
the
meaning
of
section
504.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
that
argument
and
agreed
with
us
that,
of
course,
infants
are
entitled
no
less
than
adults
to
the
protection
of
section
504,
that
they
have
physical
and
mental
impairments
that
limit
major
life
activities,
which
is
the
statutory
definition
of
what
a
handicapped
individual
is.
the
court
also
noted,
and
we
certainly
concur,
that
to
say
otherwise
defies
common
sense.
indeed,
this
court
in
smith
against
robinson
stated
that
504
applies
to
all
individuals
without
respect
to
their
age.
the
court
of
appeals
below
did
conclude,
however,
that
handicapped
individuals
are
not
otherwise
qualified,
which
is
also
a
requirement
of
section
504,
and
that
was
a
requirement
that
this
court
scrutinized
very
closely
in
southeastern
community
college
against
davis,
and
there
it
held
that
an
otherwise
qualified
handicapped
individual
is
someone
who
is
able
to
meet
all
of
the
requirements
of
the
program
in
spite
of
his
handicap.
now,
the
requirement
in
section
504
that
a
handicapped
person
be
otherwise
qualified
simply
reflects
a
congressional
recognition
that
a
handicapping
condition
may
be
relevant,
a
relevant
consideration,
in
some
contexts,
and
that
when
it
is
relevant
504
doesn't
require
that
it
be
ignored.
thus,
in
the
davis
case
the
ability
to
communicate
effectively
was
very
relevant
to
whether
or
not
a
person
could
function
properly
in
a
nursing
training
program,
and
the
ability
to
communicate
effectively
was
a
legitimate
requirement
of
that
training
program,
and
therefore
a
deaf
person
who
could
not
meet
that
neutral
requirement
was
not
admitted
and
504
did
not
require
a
different
result.
in
the
context
of
medical
care,
the
principal
requirement
for
administering
treatment
is
that
it
be
medically
indicated,
that
it
be
beneficial
to
the
health
or
to
the
life
of
the
patient.
that
also
is
a
neutral
requirement.
it
applies
whether
the
patient
is
handicapped
or
whether
he
is
not.
and
the
existence
of
a
handicapping
condition
may
well
bear,
and
bear
very
importantly,
on
the
question
of
whether
certain
treatment
strategy
is
medically
indicated.
that
is,
whether
or
not
it
is
likely
to
be
beneficial
to
the
life
and
the
health
of
the
patient.
and
when
a
medical
professional
concludes
in
good
faith
that
the
disabilities
arising
out
of
a
handicapping
condition
render
certain
medical
treatments
contraindicated,
that
is
not
beneficial
to
the
life
and
health
of
the
patient,
section
504
does
not
require
that
the
treatment
be
administered.
but
when
a
patient
is
denied
treatment
that
is
medically
beneficial,
such
as
let
us
say
corrective
surgery
to
unblock
a
blocked
esophagus,
and
is
denied
that
treatment
solely
because
he's
afflicted
by
some
handicap,
such
as
down's
syndrome,
it
is
claimed
that
that
individual
has
been
discriminatorily
denied
the
benefits
of
a
health
care
program.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
i
believe
that
is
accurate.
i
believe
there
is
no--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--that
is
the
circumstance
which
creates
the
problem
that
these
regulations
are
designed
to
address,
that
is
certainly
true,
but--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--there
are
interpretive
guidelines--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--there
are
procedural
rules,
justice
o'connor,
as
well
as--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--yes,
yes.
they
have
been
put
out
for
comment,
and
in
fact
some
extremely
extensive
comments
were
received,
and
throughout
the
regulatory
history
of
this
matter
the
thinking
of
the
secretary
of
hhs
has
benefited
quite
a
bit
from
the
comment
period
and
from
the
regulatory
process.
but
the
regulations
themselves
include
procedural
requirements--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--that's
right,
expedited
access
to
records.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
yes.
in
the
context
where
the
parents
have
refused
to
consent
to
a
medically
indicated
treatment,
the
hospital
is
put
to
a
decision,
typically,
and
that
is
how
do
they
respond
to
that.
obviously,
hospitals
historically--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--that
may
or
may
not
be
true,
but
certainly
in
some
of
the
examples
that
are
available
the
doctor
and
the
parents
are
in
agreement
with
respect
to
withholding
a
particular
treatment,
yes.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
it
would
certainly
be
a
battery,
justice
o'connor,
unless
the
parents'
refusal
to
give
consent
was
overridden
by
operation
of
state
law
and
if...
and
this
is
not
uncommon
in
the
care
of
infants,
newborns.
oftentimes,
or
at
least
not
infrequently,
hospitals
are
faced
with
the
responsibility
essentially
to
seek
to
override
parents'
refusal
to
consent
to
some
clearly
beneficial
treatment,
surgery
or
the
withholding
of
nourishment
itself.
for
example,
there
are
many
cases
involving
religious
objections
that
parents
may
have
to
certain
medical
treatment,
medical
treatment
that
is
life
saving
and
that
is
clearly
beneficial,
about
which,
you
know,
there's
no
medical
difference
of
opinion
that
it's
beneficial,
that
it's
medically
indicated,
but
the
parents
nonetheless
will
refuse
the
treatment.
in
that
context,
hospitals
and
child
protective
agencies...
after
all,
that's
essentially
why
we
have
child
protective
agencies
in
the
states...
will
intervene
and
review
the
parents'
decision,
and
if
it
is
clearly
not
in
the
best
interests
of
the
child
appropriate
action
will
be
taken.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
under
those
circumstances,
the
child
protective
agencies
may
not
know
about
this
course
of
conduct
that's
been
agreed
upon.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
well,
justice
o'connor,
the
states...
what
happens
in
the
states
differs,
i
suspect,
quite
widely,
and
it
differs
in
the
context
of
the
very
example
that
gave
rise
to
these
regulations,
that
is
the
bloomington
baby
doe
situation,
where
a
child
was
born
with
down's
syndrome
and
also
had
an
esophagus
that
was
blocked,
and
the
decision
was
made
by
the
parents,
in
consultation
with
one
of
the
doctors,
not
to
feed,
either
intravenously
or
otherwise
enable
the
child
to
receive
nourishment,
and
it
consequently
died.
in
that
particular
instance,
other
doctors
in
the
hospital
disagreed
very
vehemently
with
the
decision
that
had
been
made
by
that
parents
and
one
of
the
attending
physicians,
and--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--no,
sir.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
i
think
that's
accurate,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
in
that
particular
circumstance,
where
a
hospital
undertook
to
petition
the
state
court
to
have
the
parents'
decision
overridden
and
the
court
decided
against
it,
no
different
result
would
obtain
under
these
regulations,
that's
accurate,
justice.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
i'm
sorry.
where
did
i
leave
you,
justice
o'connor?
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
well,
not
all
i
intend
to
say,
justice
o'connor.
from
what
i
have
previously
said,
however,
we
think
it's
clear
that
section
504
does
not
reach,
let
alone
attempt
to
interfere
with
or
overrule,
a
health
care
decision
that
is
within
the
realm
of
accepted
professional
medical
judgment,
because
under
those
circumstances
it
can't
be
said
that
the
handicapped
patient
has
been
denied
beneficial
medical
treatment
that
would
have
been
provided
but
for
the
handicap.
and
therefore,
in
light
of
these
facts,
what
respondents
essentially
seek
from
this
court
is
an
exemption
from
the
application
of
the
statute,
an
exemption
that
permits
them
to
make
decisions
that
are
based
not
only
on
handicap,
but
that
are
outside
of
the
scope
of
professional
medical
judgment.
in
the
context
again
of
a
handicapped
infant
whose
parents
have
refused
to
consent
to
treatment,
the
analytical
mode
is
to
different
than
if
the
refusal
was
based
on
religious
scruples
and
the
doctor
happened
to
be
the
same
religion
and
concurred
in
that
judgment.
under
those
circumstances,
hospitals,
at
least
hospitals
that
became
aware
of
the
course
of
treatment
or
non-treatment
that
was
agreed
upon,
would
typically
under
state
law
be
required
to
petition
a
court
for
review
of
that
kind
of
decision.
what
section
504
does
or
section...
title
6
if...
or
title
6
of
the
'64
civil
rights
act,
if
we
are
talking
about
medical
decisions
that
are
based
on
race,
though
candidly
those
are
much
more
far-fetched
than
these,
but
in
the
context
of
a
decision
that
is
based
on
the
existence
of
a
handicap
or
a
handicapping
condition
that
in
no
way
contraindicates
the
treatment
that
would
be
life
saving
to
the
handicapped
individual,
504
suggests
that
the
same
procedures
that
are
available
to
hospitals
to
review
that
kind
of
decision
must
be
used.
they
can't
be--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
that
would
be
the
analysis
that
would
follow,
although
what
the
government
is
looking
for
is
now
whether
there's
been
a
valid
reason
so
much
as
whether
or
not
it
appears
that
the
reason
is
handicap,
the
existence
of
the
handicap,
because
that
is
the
prohibited
criterion
under
504.
and
if
the
hospital
authorities
have
decided
that
they
will
not
invoke
the
procedures,
the
state
law
procedures
available
to
them--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--then
there
would
be
no
violation
of
504
because
they
would--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--well,
that--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--not
necessarily,
justice
o'connor,
because
the
state
child
protective
agencies
in
all
50
states
are
also
recipients
of
federal
financial
assistance,
and
if
they
make
a
decision
with
respect
to
their
operations
in
their
covered
programs
that
is
based
on
the
handicap
of
the
child,
as
opposed
to
whether
or
not
the
handicap
affects
and
makes
contraindicated
in
a
bona
fide
medical
judgment
the
treatment
that
the
child
allegedly
needs,
if
the
child
protective
agency
makes
that
decision,
it
too
would
violate
section
504.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
no,
sir,
justice
marshall,
with
respect.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
these
regulations
are
carefully
tailored
to
respect
to
the
maximum
extent
possible
the
roles
of
the
states
in
this
area.
the
only
thing
that
504
does
is
prohibit
discrimination
based
on
handicap
in
a
program
that
is
fund
through
the
funds
of
the
taxpayers,
just
like
title
6.
the
title
6
analogy
in
this
context
is
quite
apt.
if
a
decision
was
made
in
the
neonatology
ward
that
a
certain
child
would
not
receive
a
particular
treatment
or
nourishment
because
that
child
was
black,
let
us
say--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--i
think
that
they
could
not
yield
to
the
parents'
decision
in
that
context,
justice
stevens,
no
more
than
a
decision
by
a
parent
sending
a
child
to
a
federally
funded
educational
program
can--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--well,
under
those
circumstances,
the
same
thing
they
would
do
if
the
parents
had
decided
out
of
religious
compulsion.
if
a
transfusion
is
necessary
to
save
a
perfectly
normal
child,
a
blood
transfusion...
and
this
happens
not
infrequently...
then
hospitals
would
not
yield
to
the
decision
of
the
parents
in
that
circumstance.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
i
think
the
hospital
would
then
be...
the
position
of
the
hospital
would
be
essentially
no
different.
they
have
to
make
a
decision:
is
this
course
of
treatment
clearly
not
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
i
see
your
point.
i'm
sorry.
there
is
no
discrimination
if
the
hospital
would
not
seek--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--well,
that's
right.
there's
two
points.
first,
if
the
hospital
has
a
blanket
policy,
we
do
not
get
involved
in
court
to
override
parental
decisions,
no
matter
how
irrational,
no
matter
how
inconsistent
with
the
interests
of
their
child
it
is,
then
the
hospital
would
not
have
to
just
because
the
child
in
handicapped.
but
the
fact
is
state
laws
in
all
50
states
would
require
the
hospital
in
those
circumstances
to
seek
review
by
the
appropriate
authorities,
either
directly
petitioning
a
court--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--there
would
be
no
violation
of
federal
law
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
i
don't
think
so,
justice
o'connor.
the
point
is
if
the
hospital
is
set
up
to
deal
with
these
kind
of
problems
for
kids
who
aren't
handicapped,
such
as--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--i
think
that's
right,
and
so
therefore
i
don't
think
it
is
possible
for
a
hospital
to
engage
in
the
kind
of
policy
that
has
been
articulated
by
justice
stevens.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
that's
right.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
i
don't
know
of
any
state
law
that
makes
a
distinction
between
whether
the
child
is
handicapped
or
not.
but
that's
exactly
our
point.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
that's
right.
if
they
treat
the
handicapped
child
because
of
his
handicap,
for
the
reason
that
he
is
afflicted
by
this
handicap--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--oh,
yes,
justice
stevens,
there
are.
the
administrative
record
and
the
preamble
to
the
regulations,
which
is
contained
in
the
joint
appendix,
as
well
as
very
recently
the
hearings
in
congress
in
connection
with
the
amendments
to
the
1984
child
abuse
act,
where
congress
recognized
the
very
real
factual
basis
to
the
concerns
in
this
area
and
legislated
in
a
way
that
requires
state
child
protective
agencies
to
have
procedures
in
place
in
order
to
receive
complaints
or
allegations
that
someone
is
being
denied
treatment
because
of
his
handicap,
and
also
to
ensure
that
all
of
the
mechanisms
of
state
law
are
entirely
available
to
the
child
protective
agency
in
that
consequence.
so
congress
has
very
directly
focused
on
this
and
has--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--i
do
beg
your
pardon.
i
misunderstood.
the
examples
that
are
contained
are
generally
examples
that
have
been
reported.
if
they're
not
reported--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--yes.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
there
is
testimony
certainly
in
that
administrative
record,
comments,
as
well
as
a
host
of
studies
by
professionals
in
the
field
themselves
which
acknowledge
the
fact
that
oftentimes
situations
like
this
are
not
reported,
that
in
fact
the
handicapped...
the
course
of
treatment
or
non-treatment
that
is
agreed
upon
runs
its
course
and
there
is
no
reporting.
but
to
come
back
momentarily,
justice
marshall,
to
your
question,
the
regulations
do
reflect
a
very
sensitive
regard
for
the
role
of
the
state
in
this
respect,
and
in
fact
one
of
the
key
features
of
those
regulations
is
to
encourage
hospitals,
federally
funded
hospitals,
to
set
up
infant
care
review
committees,
so
that
decisions
of
this
kind
can
routinely
be
looked
at
by
professionals
and
others
in
the
field
to
determine--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--excuse
me?
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
well,
the
validity
of
the
regulations--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--justice
marshall,
certainly
it
is
true
that
until
section
504
was
passed
there
was
no
foundation
whatever
for
the
federal
government
to
inquire
in
any
way
into
these
kinds
of
decisions,
except
to
the
extent
perhaps
that
a
decision
in
a
state
hospital
might
be
unconstitutional,
relying
on
this
court's
recent
ruling
in
the
cleveland
county
case.
but
that's
another
matter
entirely.
the
whole
point
is
the
504,
and
in
1973
when
it
was
passed,
is
the
first
occasion
for
the
federal
government's
inquiry
into
this,
just
as
prior
to
1964
and
the
passage
of
title
6
the
federal
government
had
no
role
at
all
inquiring
into
whether
or
not
health
services
were
provided
on
a
non-discriminatory
basis
to
people
of
all
races.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
in
the
first
instance,
justice
white,
if
the
recipient
of
federal
funds
finds
merit
in
the
secretary's
suggestion
that
an
infant
care
review
committee
be
assembled
and
put
in
place,
then
that
is
the
first
instance
where
the
initial
decision
is
reviewed,
and
if
they
disagree
with
it
then
it
would
automatically
go
to
the
child
protective
services
agency.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
if
the
infant
care
review
committee
decided
that
this
decision
is
outside
the
scope
of
legitimate
medical
judgment.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
then--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--that
would
be
the
end
of
their
role.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
if
the
review
committee
disagrees,
it
would
go
to
the
child
protective
agency.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
and
then
the
decision...
the
inquiry
would
be
the
same
there.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
if
they
disagree
with
the
parents
and
the
doctor,
then
presumably
they
would
undertake
those
state
court
procedures
necessary
to
override
the
decision
of
the
parents
and
the
doctor
and
have
the
treatment
or
the
nourishment
administered
to
the
child.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
no,
sir.
the
federal
standard
is
what
requires
them
to
go
to
state
court,
but
it
is
certainly
true
that
it
would
be
the
state
child
abuse
and
neglect
standard
that
obtains
there
in
the
state
court.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
if
the
federal
government--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--the
federal
standard
that
governs
the
conduct
of
the
recipient
of
federal
funds,
which
is
the
child
protective--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--agency.
yes,
sir,
that
standard,
a
non-discrimination
standard,
would
govern.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
justice
white,
there
will
be
many
instances
where--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--in
order
to
determine
whether
a
decision--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--has
been
based
on
an
impermissible
criterion,
you
must
look
at
the
decision
itself,
that
is
certainly
true.
