ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
principal
issue
in
this
case,
of
course,
is
whether
petitioner
united
auto
workers
has
standing
to
bring
the
suit
and
to
seek
the
relief
requested
here.
but
because
this
court
has
inquired
about
christian
and
because
the
petitioners
make
so
much
of
that
case,
perhaps
i
should
first
explain
that
christian
does
not
hold
that
the
sort
of
claim
splitting
that
was
done
here
can
be
undertaken.
christian
first
of
all
is
a
classic
collateral
order
type
of
case
within
the
meaning
of
mathews
v.
eldridge.
the
principle
at
issue
there
had
to
do
with
procedure.
more
than
that,
it
didn't
just
have
to
do
with
state
procedure,
it
had
to
do
with
a
procedure
that
the
federal
agency
would
have
to
go
through
with
respect
to
redetermination
or
reasons
why
persons
were
tried.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
that's
another
basis
for
distinguishing
it,
justice
white.
the
question...
the
jurisdictional
question
that
was
raised
there
and
is
articulated
in
that
case
and
discussed
is
whether
mandamus
jurisdiction
is
available
with
respect
to
a
suit
against
a
federal
officer,
not
on
the
basis
of
the
constitution.
furthermore,
in
that
case
the
court
also
suggested
on
remand
that
the
court
might
want
to
hold
the
case
open
and
let
the
state
administrative
process
go
forward
to
further
ripen
the
suit,
so
that
for
all
those
reasons
we
don't
believe
that
christian,
et
al.
is
some
kind
of
a
sweeping
holding
that
under
239(d)
cases
issues
can
be
plucked
out
of
state
proceedings
and
taken
into
federal
court.
because
the
united
auto
workers
has
alleged
no
injury
to
itself
as
an
organization
here,
it
must
satisfy
the
requirements
for
representative
standing
that
are
set
forth
in
hunt
v.
washington
apple
advertising
commission.
in
our
argument
we
show,
first,
that
the
petitioner
has
not
satisfied
the
hunt
requirements,
and
in
the
alternative,
we
suggest
that
the
hunt
test
does
not
really
fully
address
the
concerns
raised
by
the
standing
issue
in
the
context
of
this
case,
and
that
the
court
might
wish
to
look
to
class
action
principles
to
inform
its
representative
standing
doctrine.
as
has
been
stated,
returning
to
hunt,
the
hunt
test
has
three
parts:
first,
whether
members
would
be
able
to
sue
in
their
own
right;
second,
whether
the
interests
that
the
union
seeks
to
protect
are
germane
to
the
organization's
purpose;
and
third,
whether
the
claim
asserted
and
the
relief
requested
require
the
participation
of
individual
members
in
the
lawsuit.
and
we
have
argued
that
the
petitioners
have
not
satisfied
any
of
the
three
prongs
of
hunt.
turning
to
the
first
prong
of
hunt,
then,
whether
members
can
sue
in
their
own
right,
we
have
shown
in
our
brief
that
no
member
would
have
been
able
to
bring
an
action
similar
to
this
case.
petitioners'
primary
argument
in
rebuttal
is
that
we
have
gone
too
far
in
asking
that
someone
actually
be
able
to
come
into
court
and
bring
suit.
they
say
that
it
should
be
enough
that
some
member
show
injury
to
itself.
but
actually,
the
petitioners'
own
assertions
in
their
brief
disprove
their
argument
because
in
their
reply
brief
they
have
disclaimed
any
desire
to
represent
those
persons
who
went
through
the
state
administrative
process
and
then
went
to
state
court
and
were
denied
benefits
in
state
court
and
say
we
have
no
desire
to
represent
those
people
here.
that
certainly
suggests
to
us
that
they
are
admitting
that
something
more
than
just
injury
is
required
under
the
warth
test,
and
that
warth
really
looks
to
whether
someone
could
bring
a
justiciable
case...
and
those
are...
that
is
the
language
of
warth.
it
requires
that
a
justiciable
case
be
able
to
be
identified
with
respect
to
a
union
member.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
that's
correct.
that
is
what
we
are
suggesting.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
i'm
sorry?
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
well--
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
--well,
but
what
we
are
saying
is
that
what
warth
requires
goes
beyond
injury.
it
requires
that
someone,
there
actually
be
some
member
who
could
come
into
court
and
bring
suit,
and
we
have
actually
narrowed
it
down
now
to
two
groups
of
people
that
the
petitioners
suggest
among
their
members
would
be
able
to
come
into
court.
first,
they
suggest
that
members
who
pursued
their
claim
through
the
state
administrative
process
but
did
not
go
to
court
would
be
able
to
come
in,
and
secondly,
they
suggest
that
members
who
began
but
did
not
complete
the
state
administrative
process
would
be
able
to
come
in.
but
both
those
groups
include
persons,
first,
who
would
be
estopped
by
administrative
collateral,
collateral
estoppel,
because
they
would
have
let
their...
they
would
have
intentionally
abandoned
their
claims,
having
gone
to
the
administrative
process,
they
would
have
dropped
out
at
some
stage.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
well,
some
state
proceedings,
i
believe
it
was
a
state
court
proceeding,
though,
that
was
held
in
abeyance,
not
the
administrative
proceeding,
and
they
have
suggested
that
people
who
go
to
state
court
are
not
the
people...
that
people
who
are
in
state
court
are
really
not
the
people
that
they
are
interested
in
representing.
it
is
the
people
in
the
administrative
process.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
no,
we
don't
believe
so
because
that
person
would
not
be
able
to
forgo
the
state
process
and
then
leave
that
and
go
into
federal
court
to
make
this
sort
of
a
challenge.
precisely
because
of
the
considerations
of
comity,
that
the
wycoff
case
and
green
v.
mansour
suggest.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
well,
but
the
state
court
may
be
waiting
to
hear,
but
we
think
that
it
was
inappropriate
for
the
state
court
to
stay
its
processes
pending
some
federal
process.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
well,
it
is
our
view
that,
again,
that
warth
v.
sullivan
requires
something
more
than
that
someone
be
out
there
injured,
but
rather,
that
there
be
a
real
person,
real
union
member
who
would
be
able
to
under
all
considerations
of
ripeness
and
various
considerations
of
justiciability,
would
be
able
to
actually
come
into
court.
warth
itself--
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
--well--
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
--well,
first
of
all,
we
certainly
don't
concede
in
this
case
in
any
way
that
there
would
be
subject
matter
jurisdiction
other
than
of
a
sort
of
a
collateral
mathews
v.
eldridge
type.
but
the
court
granted
certiorari
in
this
case
on
the
issue
of
standing,
and
therefore,
we
have
briefed
and
argued
this
case
in
the
context
of
standing.
but
our
reading
of
this
court's
cases
is
that
when
the
first
hunt
inquiry
is
made
as
to
whether
any
individual
would
be
able
to
come
into
court,
that
that
goes
beyond
some
sort
of
determination
of
injury.
warth
itself
looked
to
rather
a
member
of
the
housing
association,
whether
a
member
applied
for
a
variance
and
had
a
ripe
claim.
one
member
of
the
association
had
applied
for
a
variance
at
one
tie,
but
his
claim
was
stale.
so
we
read
warth
and
hunt
as
requiring
something
more
than
that
there
be
a
member
there
with
injury,
but
rather,
that
there
be
something
who
can
be
pointed
to
who
would
be
able
to
come
into
court.
the
decision
of
the
district
court
here
is
quite
a
serious
affront
to
principles
of
comity.
it
requires
that
73,000
claims
be
readjudicated,
and
it
ignores
in
our
view
the
congressional
mandate
that
these
sorts
of
claims
under
239(b)
be
taken
care
of
in
the
state
administrative
process.
it
also
overrides--
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
--well,
we
believe
that
it
is
open
on,
well
it
wouldn't
exactly
be
remand,
but
on
reprocessing,
if
you
will,
for
our
defenses
to
be
raised,
that
people
had,
for
example,
forgone
their
right
to
raise
the
particular
issue
here
previously,
and
we
detail
in
our
brief
a
number
of
the
issues
that
we
think
would
be
able
to
be
raised
again.
and
this
is
important,
really,
from
two
standpoints,
for
purposes
of
our
argument.
first,
it
points
out
that
the
very
retrospective
nature
of
the
relief
that
is
prayed
for
here,
even
if
someone
could...
there
is
some
individual
who
could
come
into
court,
that
it
is
inappropriate
for
the
district
court
to
be
ordering
all
of
these
closed
state
proceedings
to
be
reopened.
and--
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
--that's
correct,
and
that
they
be
reopened,
and
this
reopening
is
going
to
be,
in
many
cases,
the
district
court
is
disregarding
state
procedures
that
give
certain
requirements
for
having
cases
reopened,
where
you've
got
certain...
michigan,
for
example,
has
a
rule
that
cases
can
only
be
reopened
for
one
year
for
good
cause.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
well,
i
think
probably
what
the
secretary
would
have
done
would
have
been
to
ask
the
state
agencies
to
litigate
that
question--
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
--in
the
states.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
i
believe
so.
i
mean,
and
there
may
be
something
i'm
missing
here
by
way
of
declaratory
relief,
but
i
would,
i
would
think
that
particularly--
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
--well,
except
that
congress
has
chosen
this
50
state
process.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
well,
any
time
you
are
going
to
have
a
process
going
through
the
50
states,
there
are
going
to
be
different
decisions
on
rules
of
law
as
you
go
along
as
a
matter
of
course.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
there
are
a
lot
of...
and
courts
of
appeals
as
well,
that
can
make
different
rulings.
turning
then
to
the
second
prong
of
the
hunt
test,
whether
the
interests
that
the
union
seeks
to
protect
are
germane
to
the
organization's
purposes,
the
petitioner
states
in
its
reply
brief
that
the
secretary
and
this
court
may
not
define
for
the
union
what
its
purposes
are,
but
that
assertion
on
their
part
seems
to
run
contrary
to
the
second,
what
is
required
by
the
second
prong
of
the
hunt
test.
moreover,
the...
i
think
that
it
is
quite
unclear,
certainly
unclear
from
the
complaint
in
this
case,
as
opposed
to
the
uaw
constitution
which
has
come
in
only
in
the
reply
brief,
that
union
members
would
have
expected
the
union
to
be
bringing
this
kind
of
action
on
their
behalf,
and
congress
in
particular,
i
believe
that
the
congressional
scheme
should
inform
this
germaneness
inquiry
because
congress
has
explicitly
provided
for
union
standing
to
seek
certification,
to
seek
the
certification
of
groups
of
workers
as
part
of
the
earlier
stages
of
this
trade
reallowance
or
readjustment
allowance.
but
congress
has
created
quite
an
individual
process
for
the
part
where
workers
go
into
the
state
administrative
process
to
actually
get
their
money,
so
that
under
block
v.
community
nutrition
institute
where
congress
has
set
up
a
detailed
mechanism
for
review
at
the
behest
of
a
particular
group
of
persons,
in
this
case,
the
workers
applying
themselves,
it
may
be
found
that
review
by
others
is
impliedly
concluded,
and
that
the
union
should
not
be
able
to
come
in.
the
third
prong
of
the
hunt
test,
of
course,
asks
whether
individual
members
of
the
association
must
participate
in
order
to
provide
the
relief
requested,
and
as
i
think
was
clear
from
the
questions
that
justice
o'connor
was
asking
of
petitioners'
counsel,
it
is
quite
an
individual
process
that
is
going
to
be
required
here.
the
reprocessing
cannot
be
expected
to
be
without
question.
individuals
are
going
to
have
to
be
heard
with
respect
to
their
respective
claims,
and
the
district
court's
order,
i
think,
really
obscures
what
is
going
on.
the
district
court
has
treated
it
as
a
simple
matter
by
simply
ordering
that
the
reprocessing
take
place,
but
this
should
not
obscure
the
actual
remedial
process
that
will
be
applied.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
that's
correct,
justice
rehnquist,
and
that
is
a
reason
why
the
district,
or
the
court
below,
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
with
regard
to
requiring
the
joinder
of
the
state
agencies.
the
secretary
can
direct
the
state
agencies,
and
state
agencies
are
by
contract
agents
of
the
secretary,
but
what
is
going
to
be
required
here
is
that
a
lot
of
state
manpower
be
marshalled
and
files
gone
through,
and
if
the
state
agency
does
not
comply,
the
secretary
can
order
and
can
ask
and
maybe
can
take
over
the
process,
but
there
is
not
going
to
be
any
kind
of
ability
for
direct
control
by
the
district
court
here.
although
we
believe
that
we
should
prevail
under
the
three-part
hunt
test,
it
has
seemed
to
us
that
the
hunt
test
leaves
unaddressed
some
very
important
issues
that
arise
in
this
litigation
and
that
have
arisen
in
other
cases.
this
case
has
evolved
to
raise
some
very
difficult
issues
concerning
adequacy
of
representation
and
collateral
estoppel
effect
of
the
judgment,
and
i
hasten
to
add
that
by
adequacy
of
representation
i
certainly
do
not
mean
to
refer
to
the
quality
of
petitioners'
counsel's
presentation
for
which
we
have
nothing
but
respect,
but
the
problem
that
we
are
referring
to
is
that
certain
groups
who
were
covered
by
the
district
court's
order
are
no
longer
being
represented
in
this
court.
the
district
court's
order
covers
non-uaw
members
as
well
as
<uaw>
[=
uaw]
members,
but
the
petitioner
now
disclaims
any
desire
to
represent
non-uaw
members.
furthermore,
the
district
court
order
also
covers
uaw
members
who
continue
through
the
administrative
process
to
state
court,
and
who
then
in
state
court
were
denied
benefits.
the
district
order
covers
those
persons.
but
the
petitioner
in
this
case
now
for
the
first
time
in
this
court
has
disclaimed
any
desire
to
represent
this
group.
thus,
we
have
two
groups
of
individuals
who
simply
have
been
dropped
almost
unnoticed
from
the
case--
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
--well,
it's
not
a
benefit
for
the
government,
justice
stevens,
when
we
don't
know
what
the
collateral
estoppel
effect
is
going
to
be,
particularly
with
regard
to
the
uaw
members
who...
non-uaw
members,
excuse
me,
who
had
a
judgment
on
the
merits
in
their
favor
which
might
be
overturned
on
remand.
we
are
not
sure
what
the
collateral
estoppel
effect--
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
--well,
on
remand,
the
merits--
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
--well,
on
remand,
the
district...
the
court
of
appeals
has
not
yet
ruled
on
the
merits
of
the
interpretation
of
the
statute,
so
the
district
court's
order
might
be
overturned
on
the
merits.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
well,
this
case
really
cries
out
for
a
class
certification.
if
the--
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
--no,
we
did
not.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
petitioner
thought
petitioners
must
move
for
certification.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
that's
right.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
but
that
has
been
benefits
for
the
government
as
well
because
it
sets
up
a
collateral
estoppel
effect
that
benefits
the
defendants.
and
that
is
quite
important.
if
in
this
case
there
had
been
a
focus
early
on
on
who
was
being
represented
and
what
the
different
arguments
were
with
respect
to
subgroups
who
were
having
arguments
made
on
their
behalf,
we
would
not
have
this
problem
at
this
point
of
having
many
threshold
issues
unresolved.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
well,
we
have
argued
that
the...
that
class
certification
should
not
be
opened
on
remand
because
there
was...
the
petitioners
did
not
move
in
a
timely
fashion
for
certification.
but
it's
not
just
the
plaintiffs
who
are,
who
are
benefitted
by
clear
procedures
and
issues
of
law
that
are
defined
from
the
outset
of
litigation.
all
litigants
benefit
from
that,
and
we
think
that
the
representative
standing
doctrine
addresses
to
some
extent
the
issues
that
come
up
in
class
certification;
it
looks
to
germaneness.
that
is
sort
of
a
little
bit
like
whether
there
is
adequacy
of
representation.
but
we
think
that
there
are
some
issues
that
get
glossed
over
by
the
representative
standing
inquiry
that
could
be
dealt
with
more
efficiently
under
a
class
certification
basis.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
well,
it
is
a
new
suggestion.
of
course,
justice
o'connor,
we
did
not
argue
standing
at
all
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
the
court
of
appeals
decided
this
case
on
its
own
motion
on
standing
grounds,
and
of
course,
in
this
court
we
opposed
certiorari,
and
so
we
really
didn't
have
occasion
to
develop
very
fully
the
standing
issue
on
our
brief
in
opposition.
and
so
the
first
time
we
have
had
a
full
opportunity--
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
--well,
of
course,
the
whole
standing
issue,
there
was
certain
language--
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
i
was
discussing
before
lunch,
the
lunch
break,
with
justice
stevens
with
regard
to
our
somewhat
broader
argument
that
class
certification
procedures
should
be
looked
to
in
cases
of
this
sort,
there
is
a
benefit
to
the
government
going
into
litigation
and
knowing
what
is
at
stake
in
the
case,
and
there
is
also
a
benefit
to
the
government
at
the
end
of
the
litigation
to
have
some
assurance
that
there
will
be
a
collateral
estoppel
effect
with
regard
to
the
outcome
of
the
litigation.
we
also
think
that
there
is
a
benefit
to
litigants
generally
to
having
litigation
conducted
in
a
way
that
assures
some
adequacy
of
representation
with
regard
to
different
groups
whose
interests
are
at
stake.
this
case
really
cries
out
for
class
certification
to
have
defined
the
interests
of
the
various
subgroups
at
the
outset
of
the
litigation.
persons,
groups
of
persons
have
been
dropped
out
with
any
focus
on
their
rights,
and--
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
--well,
of
course,
we
would
have--
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
--opposed
class
certification
here.
we
would--
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
--well,
but
that's
looking
just
at
the
outcome
and
not
the
process.
of
course
we
think
that
the
government
should
have
prevailed
here.
we
think
it
should
have
prevailed
on
any
number
of
grounds,
and
we
think
that
it
should
have
prevailed
on
the
merits,
but
we
think
that
as
a
procedural
matter
this
case
is
in
a
very
awkward
process.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
well,
here's
what
would
have
happened
in
the
proceeding,
i
believe.
the...
an
individual
member
of
the
uaw--
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
--should
have
been
named
as
the
plaintiff,
and
that
member
would
have
sought
a
class
either
of
everyone
who
was...
had
been
subjected
to
this
interpretation
or--
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
--well,
they
probably
would
have
sought
a
nationwide.
i'm
not
saying
it
was
proper,
they
probably
would
have
sought
a
nationwide
case--
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
--well,
look,
i'm
saying
what
happened
in
this
case
in
federal
court.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
well,
what
should
have
happened
is
that
individual
members
should
have
moved
for
class
certification.
if
that
had
been
done,
it
is
our
contention
that
the
court
would
have
been
required
to
focus
early
on,
as
happens
in
some
of
these
social
security
cases
that
come
to
you,
on
the
different
subjects
that
people
should
have
exhausted,
the
people
who
got
to
the
end
of
the
process
and
have
res
judicata
effect
with
regard
to
their
claims.
now,
we
think
we
would
have
prevailed
as
to
all
of
those
subgroups,
and
we
also
would
have
made
our
jurisdictional
argument,
but
as
the
litigation
proceeded,
at
leas
you
would
have
known
which
people
the
district
court
would
have
certified,
which
it
had
dropped
out.
if
it
had
blocked
out
various
groups
for
a
particular
reason,
a
representative
of
that
groups
could
have
intervened
and
sought
to
appeal
the
denial
of
certification
as
to
that
person.
so,
you
know,
we
don't
feel
that
this
is
a
particularly
parochial
argument
we
are
making
here.
we
have
looked
at
this
problem
as
it
is
has
evolved
in
this
case,
and
we
think
that
the
class
certification
procedures
really
have
a
lot
to
offer
in
dealing
with
cases
of
this
sort.
there's
also
another
anomaly
that
i
think
the
petitioners'
brief
points
out.
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
they
seemed
to
chafe
at
the
second
prong
of
the
hunt
test
of
a
judicial
inquiry
into
the
appropriate
purposes
of
an
organization,
and
there's
something
to
their
discomfort
with
that
because
the
organization
should
be
able
to
define
its
own
purposes.
if
a
class
action
procedure
were
used,
however,
you
wouldn't
have
a
judicial
inquiry
into
the
organization's
purposes.
what
you
would
have
is
a
complaint
by
an
individual
which
sets
for
the
issues
that
they
plead
and
that
they
wish
to
present
to
the
court,
and
then
a
comparison
can
be
made
with
regard
to
other
persons
in
the
universe
and
the
extent
to
which
their
interests
share
in
the
interests
that
are
asserted
in
the
complaint.
it
doesn't
require
a
sort
of
a
going
into,
as
i
say,
judicial
inquiry
into
the
organization's
proper
purposes.
and
in
closing,
i
might
just
say
that
i
think
what
we
are
proposing
here
is
not
a
particularly
radical
concept
nor
one
that
would
disadvantage
to
any
particularly
great
extent
litigants,
organizational
litigants
because
it
would
only
require
that
they
can't
litigate,
that
they
can't
have
their
name
as
the
plaintiff
in
the
case.
they
would
have
to
join
an
individual
member,
they
would
have
to
go
through
the
class
certification
process.
if
the
interests
are
very
cohesive
in
the
organization,
it
may
well
be
able
to
be
a
(b)(2)
class,
and
then
there's--
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
--well,
justice
o'connor,
i'm
not
sure
that
it's
substantially
more
burdensome
because
they
still
have
to
make
the
showing
which
may
turn
into
a
factual
showing
with
regard
to
the
three-pronged
hunt
inquiry.
the
notice
requirement,
if
there
is
one,
may
not
be
in
the
(b)(2)
class.
it
is
a
(b)(3)
class.
the
notice
requirement
may
be
able
to
be
met
quite
easily
by
an
organization.
in
fact,
in
this
case
the
union
says
that
it
used
its
magazine,
solidarity,
to
let
its
members
know
about
this
case.
an
organization
might
well
have
routine
ways
of
communicating
with
its
members,
and
that
might
be
utilized
by
the
court
to
lessen
any
burdens
of
a
class
notice
procedure.
so
i
really
don't
believe
that
what
we
are
arguing
here
is
that
burdensome
or
that
radical,
but
rather,
a
refinement
of
what
hunt
searches
for
but
perhaps
doesn't
quite
get
to.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
thank
you.
