justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
ms.
berzon,
you
are
speaking
generally
of
what
you
call
procedural
issues.
is
the
question
of
whether
this
is
a
proper
use
of
the
declaratory
judgment
in
this
situation
where
congress
appears
to
have
thought
review
should
go
through
the
state
courts,
is
that
what
you
call
a
procedural
issue?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
don't
know
how
you
define
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
but
at
any
rate,
address
yourself
to
the
question
i
asked
you.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yet,
it
is
clear
that
any
individual
applicant
who
wants
these
benefits
has
to
go
through
the
state
system.
no
federal
court
is--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--yes,
but
he
still
has
to
go,
to
get
the
money
amount
of
benefits
that
the
statute
provides,
he
has
to
go
through
the
state
system,
doesn't
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
what
you're
saying
is
that
these
players
can
split
off
one
issue
in
the
question
of
whether
they
are
determined
to
get
benefits,
all
the
other
issues
going
through
a
state
court,
and
have
the
federal
court
decide
that
by
a
declaratory
judgment.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
okay.
by
an
injunction,
which
is
an
even
more
extraordinary
remedy.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
christian
didn't
raise
the
question
at
all
of
whether--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--yes,
but
it
didn't
raise
the
question
of
whether
this
is
a
proper
use
of
federal
court
jurisdiction.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we
have
a
number
of
cases
that
say
you
can't
use
a
declaratory
judgment,
you
can't
use
an
injunction
every
time
there
is
federal
court
jurisdiction
under
1331.
wycoff
v.
public
service
commission.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can't
split
up
a
claim.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
there
is
someone
in
a
state
court
somewhere
in
the
50
states
who
is
challenging
this
thing,
i
would
think
that
that
person
would
have
standing
under
the
traditional
definition.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
from
the
standing
point
of
view,
i
would
think
the
only
inquiry
would
be
is
the
state
court
proceeding
going
to
be
over
by
the
time
this
person
gets
a
decision
from
the
federal?
if
the
state
court
is
deliberately
holding
up
its
decision
to
as
to
wait
to
hear
from
the
federal
district
court,
that
probably
is
not
a
good
enough
reason
to
say
that
the
district
court
can
go
ahead
and
give
a
declaratory
judgment,
but
i
think
it
would
at
least
establish
standing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
doesn't...
i
don't...
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
goes
to
standing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
of
course,
the
district
court
can't
bind
the
state
agencies
because
they
weren't
parties,
i
take
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they
could
seek
certiorari
here
from
an
adverse
decision
of
the
highest
court
in
the
state.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
there
is
some
requirement
in
simple
litigation
that
one
who
has
a
federal
question
somewhere
involved
in
their
claim
automatically
have
access
to
a
federal
district
court?
