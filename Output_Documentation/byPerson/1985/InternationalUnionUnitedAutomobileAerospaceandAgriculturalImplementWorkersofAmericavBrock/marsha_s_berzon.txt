ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case,
the
uaw
sued
on
behalf
of
its
members
to
overturn
a
directive
issued
by
the
secretary
of
labor
that
resulted
in
denying
trade
readjustment
allowance,
or
tra
benefits,
to
thousands
of
uaw
members.
the
uaw
requested
the
district
court
to
decide
a
single
federal
question,
whether
the
secretary
of
labor's
interpretation
of
federal
law
was
in
error,
and
if
so,
to
direct
the
secretary
through
his
agents
to
correct
that
error
by
reconsidering
under
a
proper
standard
claims
denied
under
the
invalid
directive.
the
district
court
agreed
with
us
that
the
secretary's
directive
in
facted
violated
federal
law,
and
that
thousands
of
uaw
members
had
in
fact
been
illegally
denied
tra
benefits
and
granted
the
requested
relief.
on
appeal,
however,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
reach
the
merits
of
this
controversy,
nor
did
it
reach
any
number
of
procedural
defenses
raised
by
the
government,
some
for
the
first
time
in
the
court
of
appeals.
instead,
the
court
of
appeals
decided
the
case
on
an
issue
that
had
never
previously
been
raised,
principally
on
this
issue,
and
that
is
whether
the
uaw
had
standing
to
litigate
this
case
at
all.
it
is
this
standing
issue
that
we
have
brought
to
this
court
on
certiorari,
principally,
and
that
is
before
this
court
today.
if,
as
we
believe
it
must,
this
court
reverses
on
that
issue
and
decides
that
the
uaw
may
in
fact
serve
as
the
collective
voice
of
its
members
in
this
litigation,
then
the
other
procedural
issues
would
be
opened
on
remand
in
the
court
of
appeals.
what
this
says
is
that
the
issue
before
this
court
is
considerably
simpler
than
the
government's
brief
might
suggest.
there
is
a
standing
issue,
and
the
remainder
of
the
issues
are
procedural
issues
opened
on
remand
in
the
court
of
appeals,
as
the
government's
brief--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--no.
that
issue
which
the
government
is
willing
to
assume
in
this
case,
that
is,
that
we
do
have
subject
matter
jurisdiction--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--i
think
i
am,
and
that
is
whether
in
fact
there
is
review
under
federal
question
jurisdiction
of
federal
questions
concerning
trade
act
benefits,
or
whether
the
trade
act
itself
requires
that
all
such
questions
be
decided
in
state
court,
and
our
answer
to
that
question
is
that
what
the
secretary
of
labor
keeps
asserting,
that
there
is
something
in
the
trade
act
that
requires
that
the
questions
be
decided
in
state
court,
there
is
simply
no
such
provision.
what
the
trade
act
says
in
section
239(d)
is
that
determinations
with
respect
to
eligibility
for
benefits
are
to
be
decided
in
the
same
manner
and
to
the
same
extent
as
determinations
under
the
state
unemployment
insurance
law.
that
language
does
not
say
that
the
review
is
to
be
in
state
court
or
under
state
law.
instead,
it
sets
up
a
comparative
standard.
if
you
look
at
the
relevant
body
of
comparative
law,
that
is,
state
unemployment
insurance
law,
one
finds
a
long
line
of
cases
in
this
court
and
in
the
lower
federal
courts,
and
one
would
expect
to
find
such
cases,
in
which
there
is
ordinary
federal
question
jurisdiction
to
decide
federal
issues
with
respect
to
those
benefits,
and
in
fact,
if
there
is
any
doubt
about
this,
this
court
decided
in...
a
year
before
this
statute
was
passed
with
respect
to
precisely
parallel
language
in
5
usc
section
8502(d)
in
christian
v.
the
department
of
labor
of
new
york
that
there
was
federal
jurisdiction
in
that
case
to
decide
a
federal
question.
consequently,
congress
has
not
created
an
anomaly
such
as
is
suggested
by
the
government
and
sent
off
to
state
court
issues
with
respect
to
a
purely
federal
benefit
program
where
all
the
money
is
federal,
the
administrative
money
is
federal,
this
set
of
law
that
governs
this
case
is
federal.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
that
is
true
unless
and
until
the
applicant
wishes
to
challenge
a
federal
policy
directive
which
would
govern
the--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--in
this
instance,
the
relief
did,
for
reasons
related
both
to
the
fact
that
the
uaw
was
the
plaintiff
and
i
think
took
proper
regard
for
the
state
system
and
for
the
administration
of
the
district
court,
decide
only
the
single
federal
question
and
remand
all
claims
back
to
the
administrative
system.
but
that's
the
same
thing
that
would
have
happened
had
the
case
gone
up
in
a
state
court,
the
state--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--this
is
not
a
declaratory
judgment.
there
is
an
injunction
here.
the
secretary
of
labor--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--because
the
reason
for
that
is
that
what
we
are
challenging
is
not
an
action
by
the
state.
it
is
an
action
by
the
secretary
of
labor.
the
secretary
of
labor
in
this
case
requires
that
the
states
follow
its
statutory
interpretations.
in
this
instance,
in
fact,
while...
this
is
a
particularly
inappropriate
case
to
be
contending
that
we
ought
to
have
stayed
in
the
state
administrative
system
because
what
happened
here
is
that
while
these
claims
were
in
fact
pending
before
the
appeals
body
in
california,
for
example,
the
government
wrote
a
letter
directly
to
the
appeals
board,
not
to
the
agency
in
general,
but
to
the
chairman
of
the
appeals
board,
and
told
the
chairman
of
the
appeals
board
that
if
the
appeals
board
decided
in
favor
of
the
claimants,
that
the,
first,
that
the
federal
government
would
pay,
second,
that
the
state
was
going
to
have
to
pay
out
of
its
own
funds,
third,
that
the
state's
entire
unemployment
insurance
system
could
be
decertified
with
enormous
tax
consequences
for
the
employers
in
the
state.
to
say
that
under
those
circumstances
we
are
to
sit
there
and
continue
to
deal
with
the
state
administrative
system
which
has
been
completely
biased
by
the
secretary
of
labor
asserting
itself--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--i'm
saying
as
a
functional
matter
in
the
administrative
proceeding
it
was
not
an
open
issue
because
the
secretary's
own
regulations,
as
exemplified
by
those
extraordinary--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--we
could
get
into
the
state
court.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
but
there
is
no--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--i'm
sorry.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
the
state
court
would
entertain
such
a
claim
at
the
same
time--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--because,
because
the
statute
does
not
say...
our
position
is
the
statute
does
not
say
that
we
ought
to.
the
statute
says
that
we
are
to
do
the
same
thing
we
would
do
in
a
state...
with
respect
to
a
state
unemployment.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
i
think
the
language
is
really
quite
clear.
if...
the
language
is
a
determination
under
the
applicable
state
law,
and
that
determination
is
a
state
unemployment...
is
a
determination
under
the
state
unemployment
insurance
law,
but
it
is
almost
designedly
so,
and
in
fact,
since
it
was
passed
after
christian,
a
year
after
christian,
in
which
this
court
entertained
a
case
precisely
parallel
to
this
one,
it
seems
to
me
difficult
to
maintain
that
congress
had
in
mind
complete
exclusion
of
ordinary
federal
question
jurisdiction
in
this
regard.
to
return,
then,
to
the--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--no,
not
at
all.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
absolutely,
that
what
the
court
had
in
mind
was
that
this
issue
was
now
to
be
decided
in
favor
of
the
claimants.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
exactly,
and
that's
why
we
make
the--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--as
to
administrative
exhaustion
and
to
statute
of
limitations,
in
both
cases,
our
basic
position
is
that
there
is
nothing
about
the
joint
litigation
here
that,
the
organizational
representation
that
changes
the
rules
that
would
otherwise
be
applicable.
but
the
rules
that--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--with
one
comment,
and
that
is
that
in
this
instance
the
court
of...
the
government
expressly
waived
an
exhaustion
defense,
and
we
would
maintain
that
the
district
court's
finding
of
futility
is
one
that
would
have
to
be
respected,
for
the
circumstances
that
i
outlined
earlier
with
respect
to
what
in
fact
happened
here
on
exhaustion,
and
with
respect
to
the
statute
of
limitations,
there
was
a
waiver
there
as
well
because
there
was
no
affirmative
defense
pleaded
in
that
regard.
the
important
thing
for
the
present
purposes,
however,
is
that
neither
exhaustion
nor
the
statute
of
limitations
problems
affect
the
standing
of
the
uaw
to
prosecute
this
case,
and
the
reason
is
that
there
are
individual
members
of
the
uaw
who
exhausted,
there
are
individual
members
of
the--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--the
only
individuals
to
whom
that
is...
with
respect
to
whom
that
is
the
case,
and
which
we
agree
is
the
case,
are
the
very,
very
few
individuals--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--well,
exhausted
administrative
remedies.
the
distinction
i
wanted
to
make
is
the
only
people
that
would
be
faced
with
res
judicata
were
the
very,
very
few
who
went
to
state
court
and
got
a
judgment
against
them.
there
were
a
few,
but
there
were
very,
very
few.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
we
would
maintain
that
this
case
would
have
to
be
recognized
as
adequate
to
satisfy
any
appeal
requirement
if
it
were
in
fact
applicable.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
my
very
point,
justice
white,
is
that
it
is
down
the
road,
and
that
what
we
have
here
is
an
extremely
threshold
issue.
we
were
dismissed
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
none
of
the
reasons
that
we
are
discussing
now,
all
of
which
would
be
opened
on
remand,
but
instead,
on
the
representation,
on
the
conclusion
that
the
<uaw>
[=
uaw]
simply
could
not
prosecute
this
case
at
all.
looking
at
that
issue,
the
basic
purpose
of
a
standing
inquiry
is
to
be
sure
that
the
party
that
is
in
court
can
present
the
case
in
a
proper,
traditional
adversary
manner.
as
flast
v.
cohen
says,
it
focuses
on
the
party
seeking
to
get
his
complaint
before
the
court
and
not
in
addition
on
the
issues
he
wishes
to
have
adjudicated.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
yes.
we
cite
at
the
beginning
of
our
opening
brief
a
number
of
such
cases,
including
a
number
in
this
court.
for
example,
in
duke
power
company,
one
of
the
litigants
was
a
union.
in
united
public
officers
v.
mitchell,
although
the
standing
issue
was
not
decided
there,
and
there
a
number
of
others
of...
there
are
a
number
of
csha
cases
in
this
court
which
were
litigated
by
unions.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
i
think
it
would
depend
not
on
whether
the
name
of
the
organization
was
union,
but
on
what
the
organization,
whatever
it
was
called,
defined
as
its
own
purposes,
and
in
this
case
we
have
an
explicit
declaration
of
purpose
in
the
uaw
constitution,
we
have
a
long
tradition
of
involvement
with
this
particular
program
and
with
government
benefits
for
unemployed
people
in
general.
in
this
case,
this
union
was
very--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--i
think
it
would
depend
on
whether
that
could
be
construed
as
being
within
the
purposes
of
that
organization,
as
governed
by
its
history
and
by
its
governing
documents,
and
not
by
whether
the
name
of
the
organization
was
union.
in
this
instance
i
think
there
is
no
doubt
that
these
particular
benefits
were
squarely
within
the
union's
purposes,
and
indeed,
there
is
express
authorization
and
indeed
some
measure
of
responsibility
upon
the
union
to
represent
members
with
respect
to
unemployment
benefits.
indeed,
the
decision
to
act
collectively
here
was
one
that
came
from
the
involvement
of
this
union
in
the
trade
act
for
a
while,
from
the
fact
that
it
was
representing
individuals
throughout
the
country
in
obtaining
benefits,
and
from
the
fact
that
it
turned
out
that
the
single
reason
for
denying
benefits
was
recurring
repeatedly,
and
when
inquiry
was
made,
we
discovered
that
there
was
a
directive
from
the
secretary
of
labor
that
was
in
fact
governing
the
benefits,
and
in
addition,
discovered
that
the
biasing
of
the
state
administrative
assistants
were
going
on,
and
it
was
for
that
reason
that
the
members
of
the
uaw
joined
together
to
do
something
that
none
of
them
could
have
done
on
their
own,
and
that
was
to
bring
a
major
federal
lawsuit
challenging
the
secretary
of
labor.
this
joining
together
to
enhance
the
voice
of
individual
members
is
within
long
political
tradition
and
constitutional
tradition
of
this
country,
and
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
that
process.
consequently,
when
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
uaw
did
not
have
standing
in
this
case,
it
was
going
against
a
long
line
of
cases
in
this
court
summarized
relatively
recently
by
the
chief
justice
for
this
court
in
hunt
v.
washington
state
advertising
commission.
in
hunt,
the
court
stated
three
requirements
for
finding
that
there...
an
organization
can
in
fact
represent
its
members,
and
in
this
case,
the
conclusion
that
we
were
satisfying
all
three
of
those
prongs
of
the
hunt
inquiry
is
really
relatively
simple.
first
of
all,
the
first
requirement
is
that
the
individuals
have
standing.
there
is
really
no
question
here
as
to
that
if
looked
at
as
it
properly
should
be
as
a
standing
inquiry.
there
was
direct
injury
to
thousands
of
our
members
that
were
denied
this
money,
and
money
is
the
most
concrete
sort
of
injury
that
one
can
imagine.
similarly,
only
i
think
i
covered
the
second
germaneness
requirement
of
hunt
in
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
questions;
and
the
third
prong
of
hunt,
therefore,
is
the
focus,
it
seems
to
us,
of
the
court
of
appeals'
concern.
that
prong
is
whether
there
is
any
need
for
individual
participation
either
with
respect
to
the
claim
for
relief
or
with
respect
to
the
belief
itself.
and
in
this
instance
it
seems
that
there
were
several
things
bothering
the
court
of
appeals,
none
of
which
have
any
validity
as
a
reason
why
individual
participation
is
necessary.
first
of
all,
the
court
mentioned
that
the
relief
granted
might
affect
different
members
differentially,
and
that
is,
of
course,
true,
but
it
is
true
not
only
in
any
organizational
standing
case
but
in
any
23(b)(2)
class
action,
and
this
court
expressly
noted
in
califano
v.
yamasaki
that
it
is
one
of
the
strengths
of
collective
litigation
of
this
kind
that
it
is
possible
to
focus
only
on
the
joint
uniform
problem
and
to
leave
the
individual
adjudications
to
an
administrative
system,
which
is
what
happened
here.
similarly,
the
fact
that
monetary
relief
was
involved
is
of
no
consequence.
this
court
in
schweiker
v.
gray
panthers
expressly
recognized
standing
to
obtain
monetary
relief,
there
in
the
form
of
future
prospective
benefits
on
behalf
of
members.
similarly,
the
fact
that
the
relief
is
in
some
sense
retrospective
in
that
it
reopens
old
claims
or
it
regards
claims
that
have
already
once
been
decided
is
again
not
relevant
to
the
standing
inquiry.
it
is
not
relevant
to
the
standing
inquiry
because,
as
warth
noted,
the
basic
question
is
whether
or
not
the
court
will
have
to
determine
any
of
the
individual
matters
involved,
and
as
warth
also
noted,
it
would
therefore
even
be
possible
to
award
retrospective
damages
if
the
damages
could
be
equally
divided
or
divided
in
some
way
that
does
not
get
the
court
involved
in
the
dividing
up
of
the
benefits,
and
that
is
what
happened
here.
finally,
the
government
tries
to
support
the
court's
retrospectivity
finding
on
the
grounds
of
this
court's
recent
case
of
green
v.
mansour.
green
v.
mansour,
as
its
language
confirms,
is
deeply
imbedded
in
the
eleventh
amendment
and
has
no
viable
existence
outside
of
the
eleventh
amendment
context
here,
there
is
no
eleventh
amendment
consideration
because
we
are
dealing
with
purely
federal
funds,
a
purely
federal
program
and
purely
federal
defendants.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
it
did.
it
came
to
that
conclusion
on
the
basis
of
a
construction
of
239(d),
which
the
government
is
now...
has
abandoned
and
is
not
defending.
the
government
does
claim
that
there
is
some
other
reason,
although
it
doesn't
mention
rule
19,
which
is
the
governing
rule,
why
the
states
have
to
be
joined,
but
in
fact,
there
is
no
functional
reason
why
the
states
should
have
been
joined.
the
states
were
simply
agents
of
the
secretary
of
labor,
as
the
statute
says
repeatedly,
and
the
secretary
had
full
authority
to
grant
the
relief
requested.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
that's
certainly
true,
but
as
i
said
before,
i
think
there
is
no
doubt
that
there
is
no
jurisdictional
bar
to
this
case,
and
in
particular,
i
note
that
this
court
in
cases
such
as
ohio
employment
security
division
v.
hodory,
new
york
telephone
company
v.
new
york
department
of
labor,
and
a
slew
of
other
cases,
both
in
this
court
and
lower
courts,
have
in
fact
adjudicated
state
unemployment
insurance
cases.
it
would
make
no
sense
for
those
cases
to
be
able
to
go
forward
in
federal
court
but
for
cases
that
deal
with
a
solely
federal
program
not
to
be
able
to
go
forward
in
federal
court.
we
don't
think
congress
intended
that,
and
we
think
that
the
fact
that
the
statute
was
passed
after
christian
allowed
that
kind
of
case
to
go
forward
on
identical
language
confirms
that.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
christian
did
raise
the
question
of
whether
there
was
federal
court
jurisdiction.
the
court
decided
that
there
was.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
it
seems
to
me
that
if
this
case
is
not
governed
by
the
language
of
section
239(d),
that
it
certainly
is
a
proper
use
of
federal
court
jurisdiction
because
it
has
been
done
repeatedly
in--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--but--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--in
this
instance
it
doesn't
seem
to
us
that
we
are
splitting
up
a
claim.
what
we
are
doing
is
adjusting
the
relief
to
the
circumstances,
the
best
resolution
of
the
circumstances,
that
is,
that
we
are
litigating
a
federal
issue
in
federal
court
and
we
are
designing
relief
which
affords
both
the
state
administrative
system
its
authority
to
the
largest
extent
possible
and
the
individuals
their
ability
to
control
their
individual
circumstances
to
the
largest
extent
possible.
it
doesn't
seem
to
us
to
be
a
matter
of
jurisdiction
or
of
splitting
causes
of
action,
but
rather,
of
designing
effective
and
sensible
relief
in
a
proper
federal
question
case.
thank
you.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
yes,
i
do.
i
think
i
might
clarify
some
of
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction
questions
in
this
case,
to
look
at
the
way
an
actual
unemployment
insurance
cases
raising
similar
issues
can
proceed,
and
in
fact
has
proceeded
in
this
case,
in
this
court.
in
hornry
v.
ohio
security,
employment
security
division,
the
situation
was
basically
the
same
as
what
it
is
here.
a
group
of
employees
were
denied
unemployment
insurance
benefits
based
on
a
state
statute
which
they
claimed
violated
federal
law.
they
took
that
claim
in
a
class
action
into
federal
court
and
they
obtained
from
the
district
court,
which
this
court
reversed,
an
adjudication
of
the
substitute
federal
issue,
if
they
had
one,
and
the
order
of
the
district
court
was
precisely
again
what
it
was
here,
and
that
was
to
send
the
claims
for
reprocessing
under
a
proper
federal
standard
to
the
state
agencies
from
whence
they
had
come.
there
are,
in
addition,
lots
of
similar
cases,
both
in
the
unemployment
insurance
field
and
in
other
government
benefit
programs.
in
the
lower
federal
courts
there
have
been
welfare
cases
in
this
court,
there
have
been
food
stamp
cases
in
this
court.
indeed,
the
reason
where
there
is
not
retrospective
relief
in
this
point
in
the
bulk
of
benefit
programs
is
that
most
of
them,
unlike
this
one,
are
cooperative
state/federal
programs
which
operate
with
state
funds
under
state
law,
and
under
edelman
v.
jordan
and
its
progeny,
there
is,
because
of
eleventh
amendment
reasons
and
not
for
any
other
reason,
an
inability
to
grant
retrospective
relief.
but
on
the
arguments
that
the
government
is
making
here
today
there
would
have
been
no
federal
jurisdiction
over
those
cases
whatever
aside
from
the
eleventh
amendment.
the
eleventh
amendment
would
have
been
irrelevant.
edelman
v.
jordan
would
never
have
had
to
be
decided.
in
addition,
this
court
in
migra
v.
warren
city
school
district
has
now
decided
that
state
actions
covering
1983
matters
are
res
judicata
in
federal
court.
what
that
means
is
that
if
these
individuals
had
done
what
they
were
invited
to
do
and
go
back
to
tens
of
thousands
of
individual
state
court
proceedings
instead
of
this
single
federal
case
to
litigate
their
federal
issues,
they
never
would
have
gotten
to
the
federal
courts
on
their
federal
issue.
you
would
have
had
70,000
separate
state
court
determinations
that
would--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--they
certainly
could,
they
certainly
could,
but
there
is--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--no,
i'm
suggesting
that
it
is
at
least
unlikely,
in
light
of
this
long
line
of
federal
cases
treating
other
government
benefit
programs
in
exactly
this
way
that
i
am
describing,
that
congress
in
1974,
when
writing
239(d)
of
the
trade
act
in
some
very
inefficient
and
inarticulate
way,
because
the
language
does
not
say
this,
intended
to
set
that
requirement
to
set
up
a
situation
in
which
the
only
recourse
in
a
purely
federal
benefit
program
is
the
chance
of
this
court
with
your
certiorari,
and
also
to
set
up
the
situation
in
which
70,000
separate
claims
have
to
be
litigated
in
order
rather
than
one.
at
least
it
is
both
inefficient
and
unlikely,
and
the
language
just
simply
won't
support
it.
with
respect
to
the
state
joinder
on
related
issues,
wycoff
has
been
cited,
which
was
a
ripeness
case
and
one
in
which
there
as
no
injury.
here
we
have
injury.
we
have
a
situation
in
which
the
states
are
operating
solely
as
the
state
agents...
as
the
federal
agents,
federal
government's
agents.
they
are,
of
course,
bound
by
the
federal
court
decision,
just
as
any
agent
would
be.
to
say
that
the
states
have
to
be
sued
is
equivalent
to
saying
that
the
clerk
in
the
benefits
office
of
the
secretary
of
labor
would
have
to
be
sued
in
a...
or
there
was
no
relief
against,
no
effective
relief,
and
no
finding
of
fact.
that
simply
isn't
the
case.
and
the
secretary
of
labor,
moreover,
has
efficient
resources
within
this
administrative
scheme
to
assure
that
the
states
conform
to
any
order
that
he
gives
them
pursuant
to
this
relief.
finally,
the
two
main
arguments
on
the
standing
question
that
the
government
makes,
first
of
all,
attempt
to
import
all
manner,
not
of
this
jurisdictional
question
but
strictly
procedural
questions
into
the
standing
inquiry.
i
think
this
case
shows
why
that's
inappropriate
because
one
ends
up
with
nonjurisdictional
issues
that
have
never
been
adjudicated
below
popping
up
for
the
first
time
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
supreme
court
and
being
called
a
standing
issue.
they
haven't
been
explored
below,
and
they
should
not
be
explored
now.
finally,
the
suggestion
has
been
made
that
somehow
there
are
members,
there
are
people
dropping
quit
of
this
lawsuit
or
we
are
refusing
to
represent
people
we
said
we
were
representing
and
so
on.
the
complaint
in
this
case
says
that
we
are
suing
on
behalf
of
uaw's
members.
the
relief
granted
was
conceivably
broader
than
that.
the
government
did
not
object
to
that
relief
either
before
it
was
granted
or
by
a
petition
for
reconsideration
in
the
district
court.
perhaps
it
was
an
error.
more
likely,
the
government
would
just
as
soon
grant
relief
to
everyone
as
to
go
through
and
figure
out
who
the
uaw
members
were.
but
that
really
gets
to
problem
of
structure
of
this
lawsuit.
thank
you
very
much.
