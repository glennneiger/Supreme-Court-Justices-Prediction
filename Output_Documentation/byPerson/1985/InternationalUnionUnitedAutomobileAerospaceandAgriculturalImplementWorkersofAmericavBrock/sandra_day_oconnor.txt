justice
sandra
day
o'connor
ms.
berzon,
may
i
ask
what
you
think
the
district
court
had
in
mind
by
telling
the
litigants
that
the
state
courts
then
would
reprocess
the
claims?
does
that
mean
the
state
agencies
have
to
grant
benefits,
or--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--or
are
various
defenses
open,
and
do
you
envision
that
the
court
had
in
mind
then
an
application
in
individual
cases
of
the
requirements
to
obtain
benefits?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
with
individualized
adjudications.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
statutes
of
limitations
being
applicable
and
administrative
procedure
exhaustion
and
so
forth
and
so
on?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
those
defenses
would
be
open
in
the
individual
adjudications?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
ms.
berzon,
are
there
cases
you
can
point
to
on
which
a
union
has
been
granted
associational
standing
when
it
challenged
conditions
that
are
not
on-the-job
conditions
of
employees?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
i
think
that
conditions
of
safety
on
the
job
or
health
standards
or
discrimination
are
job,
on-the-job
conditions,
and
i'm
curious
how
this
fits
in.
for
example,
would
the
union
have
standing,
in
your
view,
to
file
a
suit
to
secure
food
stamps
for
employees
who
are
substandard
in
income
or
something
like
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
then,
how
about
food
stamps?
would
the
union
be
able
to
have
associational
standing
to
bring--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
ms.
kuhl,
are
you
suggesting
that
there
is
not
a
single
member
of
the
union
who
would
have
a
potential
claim
of
this
kind--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
would
be
valid?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
just
seemed
to
me
that
that
was
a
rather
extreme
position
to
take,
and
that
surely
there
were
some
members
of
the
union
who
themselves
individually
would
still
have
a
valid
claim
to
make--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
am
i
incorrect
that
some
state
proceedings
have
been
held
in
abeyance
pending
our
resolution
of
this
case,
and
so
that
there
are
probably
some
individual
members
out
there
who
still
have
a
valid
claim?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
to
say,
to
take
your
position
that
no
individual
member
would
have
the
right
to
come
into
federal
court
with
this
kind
of
a
claim
that's
presented
here,
you
have
to
argue,
i
guess,
that
there
is
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction
at
all
in
the
federal
court
and
therefore
no
one
can
come,
and
yet
you
have
said,
i
thought,
that
you
weren't
arguing
that
point.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
it
just
seems
like
you
are.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
do
you
interpret
the
order
differently
than
ms.
berzon
does.
does
it
just
enable
individual
adjudications
of
these
claims
in
the
state
courts,
or
does
it
require
the
state
courts
to
grant
them?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
the
government
make
this
kind
of
an
argument
in
either
of
the
courts
below?
it
just
struck
me
as
kind
of
a
new
suggestion
in
the
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
seems
like
kind
of
a
poor
vehicle
or
opportunity
to
consider
something
of
that
magnitude
when
there
has
been
no
resolution
of
it
below
and
no
consideration
of
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
certainly
is
substantially
more
burdensome
than
what
the
association
would
have
to
do
today
to
bring
a
suit.
