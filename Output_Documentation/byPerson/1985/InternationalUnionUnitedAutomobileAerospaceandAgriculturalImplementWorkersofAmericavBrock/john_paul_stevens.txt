justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
you
question
before
you
do?
i'm
a
little...
i
just
can't
remember.
i
thought
the
court
of
appeals
had
an
alternative
ground
of
decision,
namely,
failure
to
join
the
state
agencies
as
necessary
or
indispensable
party.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
a
kind
of
a
basic
question
that
is
running
through
my
mind?
as
i
understand,
the
underlying
issue
on
the
merits
is
whether
certain
weeks
of
disability...
or
compensation
account
is
employment
for
purposes
of
eligibility,
and
a
large
number
of
these
73,000
people
may
be
affected
by
that
determination.
supposing
that
early
in
the
program
the
secretary
was
concerned
about
the
validity
of
its
own
policy
and
recognize
that
there's
some
ambiguity
in
the
statute,
and
thought
it
would
be
helpful
to
got
a
declaratory
ruling
out
of
a
federal
court
or
out
of
an
appropriate
court
deciding
whether
its
policy
was
right
instead
of
having
73,000
different
individual
cases
litigated.
would
there
be
any
way
in
which
the
secretary
could
have
filed
a
proceeding
against
anybody
to
get
the
question
answered
under
your
view
of
the
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
all
50
states?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would
have
to
go
to
each
of
the
50
states
and--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--kind
of
an
inefficient
way
to
get
a
question
of
general
applicability
resolved,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
congress
intended
that
the
question
of
that
kind
be
resolved
this
way.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
a
benefit
to
the
government,
isn't
it?
isn't
that
something
you
desire?
you
don't
want
to
give
money
to
any
of
those
people.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
would
it
be
overturned
on
remand,
if
you
asked
to
have
it
overturned,
maybe?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
objecting
because
your
adversaries
don't
have
counsel.
that's
a
strange
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just
don't
understand
how
that
can
hurt
the
government.
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
you
ask
for
a
class
certification?
i
guess--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
don't
want
these
other
people.
i
don't
understand
your
argument
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
order
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
nonmembers.
justice
john
paul
stevens
whom
you
say
should
lose
anyway.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
couldn't
you
suggest
on
remand,
assuming
you
do
lose,
that
the
district
court
hold
open
the
possibility
that
one
of
these
people
who
is
not
a
union
member
be
allowed
to
designate
a
class
of
nonunion
members
to
get
the
benefit
of
the
judgment.
there
are
certainly
procedures
to
pick
them
up
if
you
are
really
concerned
about
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
ask
you
one
question
about
that.
what
is
the
class
that
you
think
should
have
been
certified?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
in
what
form?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
then
i
don't
understand
how
you
say
it
cries
out
for
class
certification
if
you
would
have
opposed
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
class
would
you
think
was
appropriate
to
certify
because
as
i
understand
you
the
litigation
must
proceed
in
state
court,
so
you
are
saying
there
should
be
50
state...
50
different
classes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
would
that
have
been
a
nationwide
class,
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
a
state
court
proceeding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you're
telling
me
what
you
think
should
have
happened,
i
thought.
