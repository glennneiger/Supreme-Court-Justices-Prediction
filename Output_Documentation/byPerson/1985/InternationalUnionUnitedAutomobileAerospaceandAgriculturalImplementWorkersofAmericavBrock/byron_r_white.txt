justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you...
are
you
suggesting
that
the
validity
of
the
secretary's
directive
just
wasn't...
that
just
wasn't
an
open
issue
in
the
administrative
proceeding
or
in
the
state
courts?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
may
be
so,
but
what
if
you...
you
can
get
into
the
state
court,
can't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
wouldn't...
couldn't
you
say
to
the
state
court
this
administrative
denial
of
benefits
should
be
overturned
because
the
secretary's
directive
is
invalid
under
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
what...
just
answer.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
that
be...
would
the
state
court
entertain
such
a
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
shouldn't
you,
why
shouldn't
you
pursue
your
remedies
through
the
state
system,
like
239
suggests
you
ought
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
your
version
of
239,
i
agree
with
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
those
who
had
exhausted,
if
they
went
back
after
this
judgment,
court
of
appeals
judgment,
went
back
to
the
state
system,
might
they
be
met
with
a
res
judicata
defense?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
anyway,
they
did...
there
are
some
who
exhausted.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
are
some
states
who
apply
res
judicata
to
their
administrative
proceedings
if
you
don't
appeal.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
down
the
road,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
we
thought
that
239
was
a
jurisdictional
bar
to
federal
court
jurisdiction,
of
course,
concessions
by
the
government
or
you
or
anybody
else
wouldn't
matter,
would
it?
those
questions
could
be
raised
at
any
time,
and
even
by
the
court
itself.
justice
byron
r.
white
wasn't
christian
a
mandamus?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
certainly
ordered
that
they
be
reprocessed
without
regard
to
the
directive.
at
least
that
much
is--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
even
if
you
went
to
federal
court
on
it,
there
are
a
lot
of
district
courts.
