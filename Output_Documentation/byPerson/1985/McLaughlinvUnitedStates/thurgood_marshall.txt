justice
thurgood
marshall
would
a
club,
a
metal
club
be
a
dangerous
weapon
in
such
an
incident?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
could
be?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
could
a
gun
be
a
club?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
a
gun
be
a
club?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
it
is
dangerous
then,
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
on
the
other
hand,
is
there
any
evidence
to
show
that
they
knew
that
the
gun
was
unloaded?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
i
am
talking
about
the
people
in
the
bank.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
they
got
fear...
can
you
get
fear
without
fear
of
a
deadly
weapon?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
is
what
a
deadly
weapon
is.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
why
a
weapon
is
deadly
because
it
can
harm.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
size
gun
was
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
intent?
suppose
he
had
come
in
there
and
said
this
is
an
unloaded
gun
and
i
am
going
to
rob
you,
what
would
have
happened?
justice
thurgood

mean
outside
him
being
shot.

would
happen?

thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
actually
believe
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
was
tried
before
a
judge,
wasn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
wasn't
a
jury?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
does
that
tell
me
that
the
judge
didn't
decide
that
it
was
a
dangerous
weapon?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but,
did
the
judge
decide
that
in
order
to
convict
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
else
did
the
judge
convict
him
other
than
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but,
you
have
been
arguing
that
it
is
up
to
the
trier
of
fact.
well,
the
judge
was
the
trier
of
fact.
justice
thurgood
marshall
wasn't
he
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he
say
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
do
you
know
he
did.
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
in
the
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then,
i
get
to
my
next
question.
you
answered
the
chief
justice's
point
about
the
firing
pin,
suppose
the
firing
pin
was
okay
but
the
gun
just
jammed
when
he
shot
it.
he
shot
at
one
of
the
people
and
the
gun
jammed.
would
that
be
under
this
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
know
you
would.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
that
weapon
any
more
dangerous
than
this
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
looking
at
the
manner...
it
was
used
for
the
purpose
of
frightening
the
people.
do
you
agree?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
to
scaring
them.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but,
you
say
it
is
not
a
dangerous
weapon.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
was
the
purpose
of
the
assault?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
isn't
that
what
happened?
