well,
i
think
there
you
can
say
there
is,
in
fact,
no
weapon
or
device,
so
that
isn't
covered,
but
certainly
the
legislative
history
of
this
particular
language
would
indicate
that
the
sponsor
of
it
thought
it
would
include
fake
guns,
for
example,
does
it
not?

what
if
he
has
the
safety
device
on?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
can't
you
push
a
bullet
into
a
six
shooter
chamber
as
easily
as
you
can
take
off
the
safety
device?
