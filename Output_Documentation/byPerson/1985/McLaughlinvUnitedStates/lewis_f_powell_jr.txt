justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
this
question?
assume
that
instead
of
this
case
involving
a
revolver,
which
found
that
it
was,
it
was
an
automatic
weapon
like
a
colt
45.
let's
say
there
were
ten
bullets
in
the
clip
but
none
had
been
moved
up
into
the
barrel
so
it
couldn't
fe
fired
without
making
that
movement,
would
it
be
loaded?
justice

f.
powell,
jr.
or
there
is
only
one
bullet
in
the
cylinder
that
holds
six
in
a
revolver
and
that
bullet
was
several
cylinders
away
from
the
barrel,
you
would
make
the
same
answer?
