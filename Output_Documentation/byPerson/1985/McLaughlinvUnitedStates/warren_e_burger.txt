what
do
you
suppose
they
thought
about
that
gun?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
your
position
be
the
same
if
he
had
the
gun
loaded
but
with
blanks?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--your
position
is
that
a
firearm
is
never
dangerous
until
it
is
loaded.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
if
it
is
loaded,
but
he
doesn't
find
it
necessary
to
pull
the
trigger.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
contrary
to
your
earlier
definition
used
for
the
purpose
intended;
that
is
to
kill
or
wound
somebody
that
resists.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
here
at
1:00.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may
resume
your
argument,
counsel--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
the
gun
were
loaded,
either
a
magazine
or
an
automatic
or
a
cylinder
revolver,
but
there
was
no
firing
pin.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
if
it
can't
function
as
a
firearm.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let's
take
it
one
step
further.
the
firing
pin
is
defective
but
nobody
knows
that.
that
happens
sometimes.
what
about
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
your
position
would
mean
that
before
the
government
could
present
the
case
they
would
have
to
test
the
gun
and
see
whether
the
firing
pin
was
really
working.
chief
justice
warren
e.

mr.
wright?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
one
minute
remaining,
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
