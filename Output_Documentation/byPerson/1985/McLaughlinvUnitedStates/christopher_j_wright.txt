mr.
christopher
j.
wright
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
government's
position
is
that
an
unloaded
gun
is
a
dangerous
weapon
or
device
for
two
different
reasons.
our
primary
argument
is
that
brandishing
a
gun
during
a
bank
robbery
is
likely
to
provoke
violence.
many
courts
have
recognized
that
the
display
of
an
apparently
deadly
weapon
in
the
highly
charged
atmosphere
of
a
bank
during
a
robbery
may
lead
to
retaliation,
so
that
harm
could
occur
in
any
of
a
number
of
different
ways.
as
one
of
the
many
state
courts
that
has
held
that
an
unloaded
gun
is
a
dangerous
weapon
stated
danger
invites
rescue
and
self-help.
the
fourth
circuit
noted
in
the
bennett
case
that
frightened
bystanders,
security
guards,
or
passing
police
officers
might
take
precipitous
action
that
could
lead
to
harm
to
people
in
the
bank
at
the
time
of
the
robbery.
it
is,
therefore,
sensible
to
punish
robbers
who
display
guns
more
severely
than
robbers
who
do
not
and
we
think
that
that
was
congress'
goal
in
enacting
section
2113(d).
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
whether
a
toy
gun
is
a
dangerous--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--that
is
right.
it
depends
on
what
it
looks
like.
if
it
looks
just
like
a
dangerous
weapon,
just
like
a
real
gun,
then
we
would
contend
that
it
is
a
dangerous
weapon
or
device
under
the
statute
because
its
display
is
likely
to
provoke
retaliation.
if
it
does
not
look
like
a
real
gun,
we
would
say
it
does
not,
and
there
might
be
a
question
of
fact
in
such
a
case
for
a
jury
unlike
this
case
where
it
is
contested
that
this
was
a
real
handgun.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i
have
not
considered
that
possibility,
justice
rehnquist.
[laughter]
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i
would
contend
that
that
would
be
a
factual
question
for
the
jury
and
the
nearsightedness
of
the
bystanders
would
be
relevant
in
such
a
case.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
we
do
not
think
that...
the
toothbrush
is
similar
to
the
finger
in
the
pocket
or
the
appearance--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--i
don't
think
a
toothbrush
is
a
weapon,
although
it
certainly
is
a
device.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
it
is
certainly
a
device
and
we
think
that
the
display
of
a
toy
gun,
assuming
it
looks
somewhat
real,
would
make
it
a
dangerous
device.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
we
contend
that
if
the
gun
is
never
brandished
that
that
is
not
the
use
of
a
weapon
to
assault
anyone
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
and
we
do
not
contend
that
it
applies...
that
the
additional
punishment
of
section
2113(d)
would
be
warranted
in
such
a
case.
that
is
one
of
the
many
cases
where
we
think
subsection
(a)
would
apply,
but
not
subsection
(d).
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
we
think
under
our
view...
we
believe
that
the
brandishing
of
the
weapon
is
quite
important.
we
think
that
is
what
is
likely
to
provoke
retaliation.
we
think
that
a
finger
in
a
pocket
or
a
toothbrush
in
the
pocket
simply
is
not
nearly
as
likely
to
provoke
retaliation.
bystanders
may
well
not
notice
the
fact
that
a
robbery
is
going
on
at
all
as
was
the
case
in
the
brown
case
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
you
have
to
use
the
weapon
to
assault
someone.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that
is
right.
petitioner
agrees,
in
his
brief
at
page
12,
that
displaying
an
unloaded
gun
during
a
robbery
is
dangerous,
but
argues
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
punish
bank
robbers
who
create
dangerous
situations
because
section
2113(d)
refers
only
to
dangerous
weapons
or
devices.
we
disagree.
it
seems
obvious
that
congress
enacted
that
aggravated
bank
robbery
provision
in
order
to
give
enhanced
punishment
to
robbers
who
act
in
ways
that
are
more
likely
to
create
serious
injury.
furthermore,
petitioner
neglects
that
section
2113(d)
refers
to
devices
as
well
as
to
weapons.
as
the
legislative
history
shows,
congress
was
concerned
with
the
psychological
effect
of
the
display
of
a
weapon
on
the
minds
of
people
in
the
bank
at
the
time
of
the
robbery
and
added
the
word
device
in
order
to
make
it
clear.
as
a
secondary
argument,
we
contend
that
an
unloaded
gun
is
a
dangerous
weapon
or
device
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
because
it
may
be
used
as
a
bludgeon
as
a
california
court
noted
more
than
50
years
ago
and
as
a
number
of
courts
have
noted
since.
the
display
of
a
gun,
whether
loaded
or
unloaded,
is
a
threat
to
inflict
injury
by
means
of
beating
someone
and
a
robber
displaying
a
gun
is
capable
of
carrying
out
that
threat.
to
make
our
position
clear,
i
would
like
to
consider
one
other
example
raised
by
justice
marshall.
he
asked
whether
a
metal
club
is
a
dangerous
weapon.
we
think
that
clearly
it
is.
we
also
think
it
is
worth
noting
that
a
metal
club
is
not
nearly
as
useful
as
a
weapon
even
if
just
used
as
a
bludgeon
as
an
unloaded
gun
is.
an
unloaded
gun
when
pointed
at
someone
will
normally
cause
them
to
remain
stationary
so
that
a
robber
may
walk
over
and
hit
them
with
a
gun.
brandishing
a
metal
club
in
contrast
is
much
less
likely
to
cause
a
robber
to
remain
stationary.
that
is
why
we
think
robbers
use
unloaded
guns
rather
than
metal
clubs
in
robbing
banks.
the
legislative
history
confirms
that
congress
intended
section
2113(d)
to
prescribe
the
use
of
weapons
having
the
apparent
capability
of
inflicting
harm.
the
words
(d)
after
an
enlightening
floor
exchange.
representative
blanton
feared
that
courts
would
not
construe
the
phrase
"dangerous
weapon"
broadly
to
cover
devices
such
as
fake
bombs
and
fake
guns
and
he
proposed
amending
the
provision
to
add
the
word
"device"
in
order
to
make
clear
that
it
ought
to
apply
in
such
circumstances.
in
fact,
as
an
example
of
the
sort
of
instrument
that
he
thought
ought
to
be
covered,
he
referred
to
"one
of
those
new
kind
of
indiana
six
shooters
carved
out
of
a
piece
of
wood
with
a
pocket
knife.
"
he
also
noted
that
a
bottle
of
water
asserted
to
be
nitroglycerin
would
have
the
same
effect
psychologically
on
the
minds
of
the
people
in
the
bank
as
a
real
bomb.
this
legislative
history
which,
to
our
knowledge,
has
not
been
cited
by
any
court,
including
the
district
court
in
california
that
ruled
contrary
to
us
on
this
question,
and
we
think
that
it
clearly
shows
that
congress
intended
that
a
dangerous...
that
an
unloaded
gun
would
be
a
dangerous
weapon
because
it
has
the
apparent
capability
of
inflicting
harm.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i
think
that
that
is
right.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
representative
blanton
explained...
you
appear
to
be
looking
at
the
reply
brief,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
no.
the
exchange
covered
there
is
representative
blanton
has
proposed
the
addition
of
the
words
"and
device".
and,
as
an
example,
he
says
that
it
would
cover
something
like
an
indiana
six
shooter.
representative
sumners
then
says,
i
think
that
is
already
covered
by
section
2
which
is
now
subsection
(b)
of
the
bank
larceny
provision.
but,
the
point
is
representative
blanton
wanted
subsection
(d)
to
cover
that
situation
and
he
went
on
to
propose
the
amendment
which
was
passed
by
congress
that
added
the
words
(d)
so
that
subsection
(d)
applies
in
cases
of
fake
guns
and
fake
bombs
and
we
submit
unloaded
guns
as
well.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
we
would
argue
that
an
unloaded
gun
is
a
dangerous
weapon
as
eight
of
the
nine
state
courts--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
no,
that
is
right,
we
don't.
but,
we
think
the
addition
of
the
words
"or
device"
accompanied
by
the
explanatory
exchange
between
representative
blanton
and
the
other
congressmen
makes
quite
clear
that
congress...
representative
blanton
proposed
to
add
those
words
in
case
courts
did
not
think
dangerous
weapon
would
apply
in
cases
such
as
fake
bombs
and
fake
guns.
to
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
he
added
the
words
"or
device"
to
the
statute.
we
would
contend
that
an
unloaded
gun
is
a
dangerous
weapon
without
that
addition.
with
that
addition
it
seems
to
us
beyond
doubt
that
an
unloaded
gun
is
a
dangerous
weapon.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
it
seems
to
us
that
that
may
well
present
a
fact
question.
if
the
court
ruled
whether
an
unloaded
gun
was
a
dangerous
weapon
depended
only
on
its
use
as
a
bludgeon--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--that
is
correct.
there
has
been
no
evidence
whatever
that--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
we
don't
know
exactly
why
the
judge
ruled
it
was
a
dangerous
weapon.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that
is
correct.
and,
the
companion
case,
johnson,
which
the
court
is
holding,
was
a
jury
trial
and
attached
to
the
petition
there
are
the
jury
instructions
that
were
given
in
that
case
which
focus
on
the
apparent
capability
of
the
weapon
to
inflict
harm,
which
i
presume
the
judge
felt
was
the
test,
although
he
did
not
state
it.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
i
think
that
is
correct.
i
would
add
that
it
would
seem
to
me
it
would
only
be
the
quite
unusual
weapon
on
which
we
have
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
this
weapon
was
the
sort
that
would
not
be
capable
of
being
used
as
a
bludgeon
and
all
we
know
is
that
the
judge
here
decided
it
was
a
dangerous
weapon,
so
perhaps
he
felt
it
was
capable
of
being--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--i
think
that
is
right,
justice.
contrary
to
petitioner's
argument
and
the
argument
accepted
by
the
district
court
in
california
that
ruled
contrary
to
the
government,
interpretation
of
the
aggravated
bank
robbery
provision
to
cover
unloaded
guns
and
fake
weapons
does
not
render
redundant
section
2113(a),
the
straight
bank
robbery
provision.
aggravated
bank
robbery,
which
is
punishable
by
five
more
years
imprisonment
than
straight
bank
robbery,
differs
from
straight
bank
robbery
in
that
a
dangerous
weapon
or
device
must
be
used
to
assault
someone
during
the
course
of
a
robbery.
it
is,
of
course,
possible
to
rob
a
bank
without
the
use
of
any
weapon
at
all.
robbers
frequently
pass
notes
to
bank
tellers
demanding
money,
sometimes
claiming
that
they
have
a
weapon,
when,
in
fact,
they
do
not
have
any
weapon
at
all.
second,
robbers
sometimes
grab
bank
employees
and
threaten
to
beat
or
strangle
them
if
they
are
not
given
money
and,
of
course,
that
doesn't
involve
the
use
of
a
weapon
or
device
either.
and,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
it
may
be
later
determined
that
a
bank
robber
was
actually
carrying
a
weapon
during
a
bank
robbery,
but
he
never
displayed
it
during
a
robbery.
that
does
not
seem
to
us
to
be
the
use
of
a
weapon
to
assault
anyone.
so,
while
subsection
(a)
applies,
subsection
(d)
does
not.
in
short,
there
are
a
number
of
cases
in
which
subsection
(a)
applies
and
(d)
does
not.
and,
so
in
interpreting
subsection
(d)
to
apply
in
the
case
of
an
unloaded
gun
does
not
render
subsection
(a)
superfluous.
in
that
connection,
it
is
worth
noting
that
a
number
of
state
courts
and
state
legislatures
have
construed
their
first
degree
robbery
statutes
to
cover
the
use
of
unloaded
guns.
that
has
not
rendered
their
second
degree
robbery
statutes
superfluous.
the
fact
that
the
state
courts
have
unanimously
construed
the
phrase
"dangerous
weapon",
or
nearly
unanimously...
there
was
one
case
that
went
the
other
way...
supports
our
contention
that
such
an
interpretation
comports
with
the
plain
meaning
of
the
phrase,
and,
as
i
mentioned
before,
even
in
the
absence
of
the
strong
legislative
history
in
this
case,
we
would
so
contend.
petitioner
has
suggested
in
his
reply
brief
that
the
eight
state
cases
we
have
cited
are
not
relevant
because
the
evidence
in
those
cases
showed
that
the
gun
was
used
as
a
bludgeon
or
because
a
state
statute
in
effect
defined
an
unloaded
gun
as
a
dangerous
weapon
or
because
there
was
evidence
that
the
gun
might
have
been
loaded.
in
one
of
the
cases
we
cited,
the
nichols
case
from
iowa,
the
court
did,
in
fact,
rely
on
a
definitional
statute.
in
two
of
the
cases,
the
aranda
case
from
california
and
the
montano
case
from
new
mexico,
there
was
some
evidence
showing
that
the
gun
may
have
been
loaded,
but
we
cited
those
cases
because
the
courts
in
those
cases
made
absolutely
clear
that
whether
or
not
the
gun
was
loaded
made
no
difference
in
their
holding.
in
the
other
five
cases,
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
gun
was
used
as
a
bludgeon.
there
was
no
reliance
upon
any
definitional
statute
and
there
was
no
evidence
even
attempting
to
show
that
the
gun
was
unloaded,
and
the
courts
nevertheless
held
that
the
unloaded
gun
was
a
dangerous
weapon
when
used
in
a
robbery.
the
experience
in
the
one
state
where
a
court
held
that
an
unloaded
gun
is
not
a
dangerous
weapon
when
used
in
a
robbery
is
also
instructive.
the
legislature
in
that
state,
wisconsin,
subsequently
amended
the
state
statute
so
that
it
now
applies
to
"any
article
used
or
fashioned
in
a
manner
to
lead
the
victim
to
reasonably
believe
that
it
is
a
dangerous
weapon.
"
as
we
noted
in
our
brief,
15
other
states
have
statutes
that
on
their
face
appear
to
apply
in
the
case
of
an
unloaded
gun.
to
be
sure,
petitioner
pointed
out,
those
reflect
legislative
judgments,
but
we
cite
them
to
show
that
it
is
sensible
to
construe
robbery
statutes
to
punish
robbers
who
brandish
weapons
more
severely
than
robbers
who
do
not.
it
appears
that
the
vast
majority
of
the
states
that
have
considered
that
question
have,
like
congress,
come
to
that
conclusion.
in
summary,
the
united
states
contends
that
an
unloaded
gun
is
a
dangerous
weapon
or
device
within
the
meaning
of
section
2113(d)
because
its
display
is
likely
to
provoke
retaliation.
in
addition,
an
unloaded
gun
is
a
dangerous
weapon
or
device
because
it
can
be
used
as
a
bludgeon
to
inflict
harm.
the
addition
of
the
words
2113(d)
makes
that
clear.
if
an
indiana
six
shooter
is
a
dangerous
weapon,
then
a
real
gun
that
is
not
loaded
surely
is.
our
construction
of
subsection
(d)
does
not
render
subsection
(a)
redundant
any
more
than
the
many
state
statutes
and
cases
holding
that
an
unloaded
gun
is
a
dangerous
weapon
under
a
first
degree
robbery
statute
makes
the
second
degree
statutes
superfluous.
and,
as
the
overwhelming
weight
of
authority
in
favor
of
our
view
shows
this
position
makes
sense.
it
makes
sense
to
punish
a
robber
who
brandishes
a
weapon
more
severely
than
one
who
does
not
whether
or
not
the
robber's
gun
was
loaded.
thank
you.
