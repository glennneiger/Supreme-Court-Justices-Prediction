justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt?
supposing
on
the
facts
we
have
got
here
but
we
have
a
trial,
they
couldn't
prove
there
were
bullets
in
the
gun.
say
they
had
a
chase
and
the
man
threw
bullets
out
the
window
of
his
car,
but
you
couldn't
prove
whether
they
were
in
the
gun
or
not
at
the
time
of
the
transaction,
who
would
have
the
burden
under
your
view
of
the
law?
who
would
have
the
burden
of
proving
that
they
were
in
the
gun?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
if
the
government
cannot,
in
fact,
prove
by
some
evidence,
by
reasonable
doubt,
that
the
bullets
were
in
the
gun
at
the
time
of
the
bank
robbery,
the
defendants
would
always
win
on
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
he
had
bullets
in
his
pocket?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wright,
you
take
the
position
then
that
a
toy
gun
would
also
be
a
dangerous
weapon?
justice
john
paul
stevens
one
that
looks
exactly
like
a
real
gun.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
a
toothbrush
in
the
pocket
of
a
coat,
sticking
it
out
and
making
it
look
like--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
have
got
a
weapon
now,
with
the
finger
i
don't.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
a
toy
gun
isn't
a
weapon,
say
it
is
made
out
of
paper
mache.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
you
had
a
toy
gun
but
you
didn't
take
it
out
of
your
pocket.
it
still
manifests
the
likelihood
that
there
is
a
real
gun
in
there.
i
think
your
theory
would
apply.
justice
john
paul
stevens
a
toy
gun
is
enough
provided
they
see
the
toy
gun.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
on
your
bludgeon
theory,
the
second
of
your
two
principal
submissions,
i
have
seen
in
the
movies
at
least
some
tiny
things,
hide
them
in
their
sock
or
something,
a
gun,
but
it
will
shoot
and
kill
somebody
with
a
bullet,
would
that
be
a
bludgeon
in
your
view
no
matter
how
small
the
firing--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
that
is
the
case,
what
about
the
case
in
this
case?
all
we
know
is
it
was
a
"handgun",
don't
we?
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
don't
know
whether
it
is
big
enough
to
be
a
bludgeon
or
not.
i
wonder
if
there
is
anything
in
the
record
that
supports
your
second,
at
least
beyond
a
reasonable...
could
the
judge
find
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
you
have
got
a
"bludgeon"
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
it
correct,
as
your
opponent
suggests
in
the
colloquy,
that
they
thought
the
fourth
circuit
law
was
a
gun
being
capable
of
being
fired
is
a
dangerous
weapon
even
if
there
are
no
bullets
in
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
would
be
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
whether
this
gun
is
capable
of
being
used
as
a
bludgeon
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
he
decided
on
the
basis
of
precisely
the
same
written
material
that
is
here
in
front
of
us.
he
never
saw
the
thing
as
i
understand.
he
was
acting
on
the
submission
of
the
government
as
to
what
they
would
prove
if
they
had
to
go
to
trial.
it
was
an
offer
of
proof.
