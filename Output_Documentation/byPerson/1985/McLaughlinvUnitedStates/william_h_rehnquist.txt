justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
cribari,
it
punishes
bank
robbery
with
a
dangerous
weapon
or
device
if
the
device
or
weapon
is
used
in
an
assault
on
a
person
or
puts
in
jeopardy
the
life
of
any
person,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
it
really
doesn't
punish
bank
robbery
with
a
dangerous
weapon.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no
one
claims
he
put
anyone's
life
in
jeopardy
with
the
starter
pistol
or
whatever
it
was.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
deny
that
he
technically
assaulted
someone,
do
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
say
it
is
a
charge
to
the
jury
upon
a
question
of
fact
then
in
every
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
mean
as
a
special
verdict,
but
they
just
be
charged
to
look
to
find
that
as
a
fact
along
with
the--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
have
the
courts
of
appeals
had
occasion
to
construe
the
word
(d)?
is
it
treated
as
the
common
law
definition
of
assault
as
simply
pointing
a
weapon
at
someone
is
an
assault?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
hard
to
imagine
intimidation
really
without
a
technical
common-law
assault.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
assumes,
mr.
cribari,
that
congress
intended
it
to
be
a
question
of
fact
in
each
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there
could
be
worse
cases
than
that
for
the
government.
supposing
in
the
case
of
your
client,
except
that
the
gun
is
loaded
but
never
fired,
and
the
gun
just
simply
disappears.
the
guy
gets
away
for
awhile
and
the
government
never
recovers
the
gun.
if
the
burden
was
on
the
government
to
prove
that
it
was
loaded,
it
probably
won't
be
able
to
do
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
the
testimony
of
the
bystanders,
all
they
can
testify
is
what
happened,
they
were
afraid
because
the
guy
had
a
gun.
they
wouldn't
have
seen
any
bullets
fired
from
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
he
is
going
to
tell
them
it
is
loaded.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
the
defendant,
at
the
time
of
the
bank
robbery,
isn't
going
to
tell
the
bystanders
it
is
not
loaded.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
that
you
have
a
trial
of
this
issue
and
the
defendant
either
says
nothing
or
takes
the
stand
and
says
it
wasn't
loaded.
the
bystanders
say
he
was
going
to
shoot
us
if
we
moved.
none
of
them
can
testify
to
the
fact
that
it
was,
in
fact,
loaded.
is
that
enough
to
even
take
the
case
to
the
jury
under
the
reasonable
doubt
standard?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
just
the
hypothesis
i
gave
you.
could
the
judge
charge
the
jury
that
they
could
find
it
was
a
dangerous
weapon
with
only
the
testimony
from
the
bystanders
that
the
fellow
brandished
a
gun
at
them.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
all
the
bystanders
were
near-sighted
so
they
thought
that
the
gun
really
was
threatening,
when,
in
fact,
if
you
had
good
eye
sight
you
would
have
realized
it
was
a
toy
gun.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
perhaps
you
have
devoted
yourself
to
more
important
questions.
[laughter]
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
to
qualify
under
(d)
you
have
to
show
an
assault,
don't
you,
when
you
are
talking
about
an
unloaded--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
seems
to
me
the
legislative
history
cuts
a
little
bit
against
that
because
if
congress
thought
that
an
unloaded
gun
would
be
a
dangerous
weapon,
it
presumably
would
have
thought
the
indiana
six
shooter
would
also
be
a
dangerous
weapon,
don't
you
think?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
why
did
they
feel
it
necessary
to
add
the
word
"device"?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
the
wrong
source.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
is
the
government's
basic
argument
here
that
although
the
unloaded
gun
is
not
a
dangerous
weapon,
it
is
a
dangerous
device?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
you
don't
need
that
legislative
history,
do
you?
