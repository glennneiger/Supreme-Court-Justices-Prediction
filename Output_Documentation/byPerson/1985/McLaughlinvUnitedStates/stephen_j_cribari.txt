mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
an
unloaded
handgun
is
a
dangerous
weapon
in
violation
of
section
(d)
of
the
bank
robberty
statute
18
u.s.c.
2113.
there
are
two
points
that
i
would
like
to
make.
first
of
all,
that
an
unloaded
handgun
on
the
facts
of
this
case
is
not
and
should
not
be
a
dangerous
weapon.
secondly,
that
even
if
an
unloaded
handgun
can
be
a
dangerous
weapon,
it
ought
not
to
be
determined
to
be
a
dangerous
weapon
by
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
but
rather
should
remain
a
factual
question
for
the
factfinder.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
extremely,
concisely
stated
and
are
in
pages
eight
to
ten
of
the
joint
appendix.
the
short
of
the
matter
is
that
mr.
mclaughlin
and
a
co-defendant
entered
a
bank
and
while
the
co-defendant
emptied
several
teller
stations
of
funds,
mr.
mclaughlin
remained
in
the
lobby
area
of
the
bank,
pointed
a
handgun
generally
at
the
people
in
the
bank
and
told
them
not
to
move.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
sir,
i
think
they
thought
that
that
gun
was
probably
loaded
and
i
think
there
is
no
argument
to
be
made
that
they
were
not
in
some
degree
frightened
and
there
is
no
argument
to
be
made
that
they
had
the
duty
to
examine
that
gun.
the
question
is
how
will
we
determine
for
2113(d)
purposes
that
the
gun
was
dangerous.
certainly
if
the
gun
was
loaded
the
gun
could
inflict
a
harm
that
it
threatens
to
inflict
and
under
the
courts
that
have
applied
an
objective
test
that
has
been
the
test.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
justice
marshall,
i
think
that
a
club
could
be
a
dangerous
weapon
in
such
an
instance.
if
the
person
remains
in
the
lobby
area
of
a
bank--
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
--i
think
that
almost
anything--
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
--well,
certainly--
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
--yes,
certainly
a
gun
could
be
a
club
and
probably
a
metal
club
at
that.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
well,
i
think
it
is
only
dangerous,
and
this
is
certainly
the
analysis
used
by
some
of
the
courts,
it
is
only
dangerous
if
there
is
a
threat
to
use
it
as
a
club.
if
the
only
threat
is
to
use
the
gun
as
a
gun
and
the
gun
does
not
work
as
a
gun,
the
gun
is
not
dangerous
as
a
gun.
now,
the
courts
that
have
adopted...
like
the
fourth
circuit...
a
presumption
that
any
weapon,
loaded
or
unloaded,
used
during
a
bank
robbery
is,
as
a
matter
of
law,
a
dangerous
weapon.
i
have
certainly
reasoned
that
the
fear
of
the
victims,
the
potential
for
using
the
gun
as
a
club,
or
the
potential
for
third-party
response,
for
example,
by
police
forces,
makes
the
situation
dangerous,
but
should
we
reason
from
the
situation
back
to
the
gun?
if
we
do,
then
even
non-guns
would
be
dangerous
weapons.
the
person
who
goes
into
the
bank,
puts
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
claims
that
he
has
a
gun
could
create
the
same
amount
of
danger
as
the
person
who
actually
displays
a
gun.
by
the
reasoning
of
those
courts,
a
dangerous
weapon
has
been
used
even
though
in
one
instance
no
weapon
at
all
has
been
used.
after
this
court's
decision
in--
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
--justice
o'connor,
i
think
in
one
reading
it
does
and
i
think
in
another
reading,
which
is
my
reading,
of
course,
that
it
does
not.
certainly
the
sponsor
envisioned
fake
guns
or
what
were
referred
to
as
indiana
six
shooters
or
bottles
of
water
claimed
to
be
nitroglycerin,
certainly
they
were
included
somewhere.
the
question
is
where
were
they
included?
one
of
the
congressmen,
i
think
the
bill's
sponsor,
says,
in
response
to
questions
about
the
fake
weapon,
that
he
does
not
object
to
the
word
2
of
the
statute
which
at
the
time
was
bank
robbery
by
trick
or
fraud.
also
at
the
end
of
the
legislative
history
which
is
extremely
meager,
the
statement...
the
suggestion
that
instrumentalities
which
could
cause
fear
was
rejected
as
an
amendment
to
the
act.
so,
on
one
hand,
i
think,
yes,
the
subject
of
fear
of
the
victim
was
sought
to
be
protected
by
the
act.
but,
on
the
other
hand,
the
question
is
how.
i
think
the
act
can
be
read
consistently
with
those
courts
who
have
applied
an
objective
standard
to
amount
to
the
following:
if
a
weapon
is
used
and
that
weapon
is
dangerous
in
itself
or
can
carry
out
the
harm
that
it
threatens
you
have
a
dangerous
weapon.
if
it
can't,
then
you
might
have
bank
robbery
by
trick,
you
might
have
assault
on
the
teller,
but
you
may
not
have
a
dangerous
weapon.
the
statute
doesn't
punish
bank
robbery
with
a
weapon,
it
doesn't
punish
bank
robbery
with
an
apparently
dangerous
weapon,
it
doesn't
punish
bank
robbery
because
a
dangerous
situation
is
created.
it
punishes
bank
robbery
during
which
an
assault
is
committed
using
the
dangerous
weapon.
if
we
reason
from
the
assault--
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
--yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
it
punishes
an
assault
or
placing
in
jeopardy
during
a
bank
robbery.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
yes,
sir.
in
mr.
mclaughlin's
case,
only
the
assaultive
clause
of
2113(d)
is
operable.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
it
was
an
unloaded
handgun
and
the
claim
was
not
made
that
he
put
someone's
life
in
jeopardy.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
no,
he
plead
guilty
to
the
assault.
he
plead
guilty
to
the
(a)
and
(b)
sections
of
that
statute
which
prohibit
the
bank
robbery
assault
and
the
bank
larceny
and
we
had
a
bench
trial
on
the
(d)
section
on
the
issue
of,
number
one,
the
unloaded
handgun
and,
number
two,
the
fourth
circuit's
decision
which
makes
it
presumptive
guilt
if
you
have
any
weapon.
when
this
court
decided
simpson
in
1978,
this
court
applied
the
phrase
"dangerous
weapon"
to
both
clauses,
the
assaultive
clause
and
the
putting-in-jeopardy
clause.
much
of
the
case
law
developed
prior
to
that
time
and
much
of
the
case
law
reasons
that
an
assault
under
(a)
that
one
could
reasonably
determine
to
be
an
aggravated
assault,
if
there
was
a
weapon
used
amounted
to
a
violation
of
(d),
but
it
is
unclear
whether
those
courts
read
the
dangerous
weapon
phrase
as
modifying
the
assault.
after
simpson,
when
the
courts
had
to
read
that,
i
think
what
has
happened
is,
so
as
to
not
to
lose
the
aggravated
assault
punishment,
all
of
that
case
law
was
simply
applied
to
the
dangerous
weapon
in
the
following
two
ways:
number
one,
if
there
is
enough
evidence
for
the
jury
to
conclude
the
weapon
was
loaded
it
is
a
dangerous
weapon.
we
don't
contest
that.
number
two,
the
creation
of
presumptive...
the
creation
of
presumptions
of
dangerousness
by
the
circuit
court,
the
fourth
circuit,
the
fifth
circuit,
possibly
the
tenth
and
eleventh
circuits,
have
rules
that
state
a
weapon,
loaded
or
unloaded,
used
during
a
bank
robbery
is
a
dangerous
weapon.
there
is
no
argument.
the
effect
of
that
is
read
in
the
indictment
of
this
case
which
is
on
page
five
of
the
joint
appendix
where
mr.
mclaughlin
is
not
charged
with
using
a
dangerous
weapon,
he
is
charged
with
brandishing
that
weapon,
with
pointing
a
firearm
at
the
tellers
in
the
bank.
if
the
jury
or
a
factfinder
concludes
a
weapon
was
used,
and
mr.
mclaughlin
admitted
one
was,
he
is,
therefore,
guilt
of
using
a
dangerous
weapon
without
more.
i
do
not
think
that
that
is
correct.
i
do
think
that
that
is
a
violation
of
winship
which
was
decided
16
years
ago
today.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
no,
sir,
my
position...
yes,
sir,
my
position
would
be
the
same.
i
would
see
no
difference
between
a
gun
that
was
loaded
with
blanks
or
a
gun
that
was
unloaded
or
a
starter
pistol
or
a
gun
that
was
not
loaded
but
there
was
ammunition
in
the
person's
pocket.
if
the
gun
cannot
function
as
the
weapon
that
threatens,
it
ought
not
to
be
a
dangerous
weapon.
if
mr.
mclaughlin
had
approached
one
of
the
people
in
the
bank
and
had
struck
them
with
the
weapon
or
if
he
had
approached
someone
and
grabbed
someone
and
held
the
weapon
in
a
threatening
manner
to
threaten
bludgeoning,
then
it
becomes
dangerous
as
a
bludgeoning,
but
that
is
not
here.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
well,
i
am
not
sure
that
the...
i
think
the
burden
is
on
the
government
to
prove
a
dangerous
weapon.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
i
don't
think
that
is
correct.
i
think
if
the
government
puts
forth
enough
proof
for
a
jury
to
conclude
that
the
gun
must
have
been
loaded,
that
is
sufficient.
for
example,
in
this
case,
if
there
had
been
no
evidence
other
than
mr.
mclaughlin
pointing
the
handgun...
the
cases,
i
think,
establish
that
a
factfinder,
judge
or
jury,
could
conclude
that
gun
was
loaded
and
dangerous
since
there
is
no
evidence
to
the
contrary.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
in
this
case
there
is.
the
government
conceded
that--
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
--no,
sir,
there
is
no
evidence
to
show
that
the
people
knew
the
gun
was
unloaded
and
there
is
no
attempt
to
diminish
the
fear
of
the
people
and
there
is
no
attempt
to
say
that
people
ought
to
know
the
gun
was
unloaded.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
sir,
i
think
there
is
as
much
fear
in
the
case
of
an
unloaded
handgun
as
there
is
in
a
loaded
one.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
i
don't--
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
--i
agree,
sir,
that
the
weapon
is
deadly
because
it
can
harm.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
i
don't
know.
all
we
have
in
the
record
is
that
it
was
a
dark
handgun.
the
weapon
is
dangerous
because
it
can
harm,
but,
if,
in
fact,
it
cannot
harm
in
the
manner
in
which
it
is
used--
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
--then
the
weapon
didn't
work
as
a
gun.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
well,
justice
o'connor,
i
think
at
some
point
we
have
to
draw
a
line.
the
line
i
drew
was
the
fact
that
the
gun
was
loaded.
now,
if
a
factfinder
could
conclude
that
the
safety
device
was
not...
even
though
it
was
on...
the
gun
being
otherwise
operable
and
loaded,
the
factfinder
could
conclude
that
that
didn't
matter.
that
is
such
a
small
thing
and
so
easily
changed
that
it
did
not
effectively
negate
the
harm
the
gun
threatened.
then,
fine,
you
can
convict
someone
of
using
that
weapon.
but,
it
ought
not
to
be
taken
from
the
factfinder
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
well,
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know
if
you
can
because
it
certainly
has
to
be
opened,
it
has
to
be
taken
out
and
put
in.
and,
i
don't
think
that
it
is
a
workable
standard
simply
to
say
that
if
the
bullets
are
within
a
foot
of
the
gun
maybe
it
is
dangerous,
maybe
it
isn't,
if
they
are
far
away
maybe
it
is
less
dangerous.
i
think
we
look
at
the
gun
and
then
we
look
at
the
way
it
is
used
and
if
it
is
used
in
such
a
way
that
it
can
readily
inflict
the
harm
it
threatens,
then
it
is
used
as
a
dangerous
weapon.
but,
if
it
is
used
in
a
manner
that
cannot
inflict
the
harm
threatened,
it
cannot
be
seen
as
a
dangerous
weapon
unless
you
look
just
at
the
fear
of
the
victims
which
is
certainly
a
concern.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
in
every
case
the
jury
or
the
factfinder
should
have
to
make
the
finding
that
the
weapon
was
dangerous
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
yes.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
no.
that
is
correct,
sir.
in
the
fourth
circuit
that
is
not
what
is
done,
of
course.
because
of
the
bennett
decision,
if
there
is
a
weapon,
it
is
a
dangerous
weapon.
and,
there
is
no
argument
to
present
to
the
jury.
the
fact
that
in
this
case
mr.
mclaughlin
had
an
unloaded
handgun,
no
bullets,
could
not
have
loaded
it
and
did
not
use
it
in
any
other
way
was
meaningless
at
trial.
there
was
no
argument
to
be
made
because
that
was
a
dangerous
weapon
when
he
admitted
to
the
assault
using
the
handgun.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
no,
sir,
because
the
firearm
could
certainly
be
used
as
a
club.
it
is
not
dangerous
until
it
is
loaded
or
until
it
is
used
in
some
way
that
creates
a
danger
from
its
being
there
other
than
just
the
fear.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
well,
then
i
think
it
is
a
dangerous
weapon
because
it
can
immediately
inflict
the
harm
that
it
threatens.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
well,
i
have
no
trouble
reaching
the
conclusion
that
a
handgun
that
is
loaded
and
operable
is
immediately
a
dangerous
weapon
and
can
be
found
that
way
by
a
jury
simply
on
that
evidence.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
because...
unless
there
is
evidence
that
it
was
threatened
to
be
used
as
a
club,
it
wasn't
used
as
a
club.
we
look
at
someone
with
a
handgun
and
we
say,
well,
that
gun
could
be
used
as
a
club.
of
course.
but,
if
the
person
uses
it
in
such
a
way
that
there
is
no
threat
that
it
is
going
to
be
used
as
a
club,
should
we
infer
since
it
is
metal
it
could
be
used
as
a
club?
if
someone
robs
a
bank
carrying
a
heavy
briefcase,
should
we
infer
that
since
it
is
a
heavy
briefcase
it
could
be
used
as
a
bludgeon
and,
therefore,
it
is
a
dangerous
weapon?
once
the
gun
ceases
to
be
used
as
a
gun,
what
is
it?
certianly
it
is
a
heavy
piece
of
metal
that
could
be
used
as
a
bludgeon.
in
this
case,
there
is
no
evidence
that
it
was
used
as
a
bludgeon,
was
about
to
be
used
as
a
bludgeon
or
that
any
threat
was
made
to
use
it
as
a
bludgeon.
in
almost
all
of
the
cases
that
deal
with
the
bludgeon
issue
one
of
two
things
is
present.
first
of
all,
it
was
used
as
a
bludgeon.
even
as
late
as
last
year
in
the
wardy
case
the
second
circuit
finds
the
gun
could
be
used
as
a
bludgeon,
it
was
used
as
a
bludgeon,
and
in
addition
there
was
enough
evidence
from
which
the
factfinder
could
conclude
it
was
loaded.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
i
think
it
would
be
loaded.
i
think
even
if
it
isn't
loaded,
it
can
be
loaded
so
quickly
that
the
distinction
is
meaningless.
but,
i
think
it
should
be
a
factual
question
for
the
factfinder
to
give
the
evidence
of
how
that
gun
was
at
the
time
of
the
robbery,
to
hear
testimony,
if
the
defendant
wants
to
testify,
as
to
why
it
wasn't
loaded
and
make
a
decision.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
the
same
answer.
i
would
conclude
that
it
was
loaded,
but
i
would
also
want
to
give
in
to
the
factfinder
to
draw
the
conclusion
of
dangerousness.
in
all
of
the
state
cases,
virtually
every
state
case
that
is
cited
for
the
proposition
that
an
unloaded
handgun
is
a
dangerous
weapon,
there
is
involved
a
statute
making
an
unloaded
handgun
a
dangerous
weapon.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
let
me
answer
by
saying
yes,
but
i
am
going
to
say
that
the
cases...
the
language
in
the
cases
is
not
as
simply
as
a
yes
answer.
the
beasley
case
which
judge
mccree's
dissent
worked
its
way
into
this
court's
decision
in
simpson
that
the
dangerous
weapon
phrase
applies
to
the
assault
clause
discusses
common-law
assault,
discusses
what
an
assault
is
under
(a)
and
says,
as
does
bradley
and
many
of
the
other
cases
on
my
side
of
the
fence,
you
need
more
than
an
assault
to
get
from
(a)
to
(d).
you
need
a
sufficiently
aggravating
factor
that
takes
the
case
out
of
the
violation
of
(a),
taking
the
money
by
intimidation,
and
getting
into
(d),
using
a
dangerous
weapon.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
well,
it
is,
but
it
is
not
hard
to
imagine
it
without
a
gun.
i
think
you
do
reach
the
common-law
assault,
but
when
do
you
get
from
the
assault
to
the
dangerous
weapon?
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
certainly
there
is
a
violation--
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
--if
the
man
comes
in
and
says
his
gun
is
unloaded
and
i
am
going
to
rob
you--
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
--he
probably
would
be
caught.
in
addition,
he
may
well
get
money
from
the
tellers
who
might
be
frightened
any
way.
he
also
could--
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
--that
he
might
get
money?
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
well,
based
on
some
of
the
people
i
have
represented,
yes,
i
do.
i
also
know
they
get
caught
outside
the
bank.
[laughter]
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
thank
you.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
discuss
briefly
the
second
point
that
i
wanted
to
discuss
today
which
is
the
fourth
circuit's
decision
in
the
bennett
case
that
establishes
that
a
weapon,
loaded
or
unloaded,
used
during
a
bank
robbery
is
a
dangerous
weapon.
we
think
that
is
a
violation
of
this
court's
decision
in
winship
because
it
takes
from
the
government
the
burden
of
having
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
a
weapon
used
in
an
assault
during
a
bank
robbery
is
a
dangerous
weapon
as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
it
does
indeed.
if
congress
were
to
pass
a
definitional
statute
saying
unloaded
handguns
are
dangerous
weapons
within
the
purview
of
this
act
we
are
not
here,
but
that
is
not
there.
it
is
there
in
other
firearms
legislation.
it
is
there
in
924,
but
it
is
not
there
in
2113,
and
because
it
is
not
there
the
fourth
circuit
shouldn't
put
it
there.
it
should
leave
the
question,
a
question
of
fact
for
the
factfinder
and
not
foreclose
the
factfinder
from
considering
all
the
circumstances
involved
in
making
a
decision
whether
that
weapon
was
dangerous.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
if
there
is
no
firing
pin
and
the
weapon
cannot
function
as
a
weapon,
then
i
don't
think
it
is
dangerous
as
a
weapon.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
as
a
firearm.
if
it
can't
function
as
the
weapon
it
appears
to
be,
unless
it
is
used
as
a
different
weapon.
if
the
threat
is
made
to
bludgeon,
then
we
can
determine
from
the
facts
regarding
its
uses
as
a
bludgeon.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
my
position
would
be,
first
of
all,
that
that
weapon
that
could
not
operate
as
the
handgun,
without
more,
that
is
all
it
is
used
as,
is
not
a
dangerous
weapon.
just
like
white,
powdery
substances
that
test
out
to
be
baking
soda
are
not
heroin.
if
the
court
doesn't
want
to
go
that
far
and
the
court
wants
to
leave
that
question
about
dangerousness
for
the
factfinder,
that
also
is
an
acceptable
position.
either
of
those
positions
cut
against
the
fourth
circuit's
decision
in
bennett.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
it
might
mean
that.
it
certainly
would
mean
the
government
could
not
sustain
or
might
not
be
able
to
sustain
a
verdict
of
guilty
given
evidence
that
the
person
who
used
the
gun
knew
the
firing
pin
was
defective.
in
fact,
the
person
who
used
the
gun
may
have
caused
damage
to
the
firing
pin
just
so
no
one
would
be
injured
by
use
of
the
gun.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
well,
justice
rehnquist,
the
cases
are
clear,
and
once
again
we
do
not
dispute
the
cases
that
say
from
circumstantial
evidence
the
jury
would
be
warranted
in
inferring
the
gun
was
loaded.
if
the
defendant
testified
that
at
the
time
of
the
crime
the
gun
was
not
loaded,
and
there
is
the
testimony
from
the
victims,
bystanders,
or
whatever,
it
would
be
a
question
of
fact
first.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
that
is
true,
but
they
can
testify
to
what
the
person
who
perpetrated
the
robbery
did
with
the
gun.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
he
is
going
to
tell
them...
the
bystander
is
going
to
say
that
i
saw
a
gun.
the
defendant
is
going
to
say
it
was
not
loaded.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
of
course
not,
which
is
why
at
the
very
least
we
have
a
factual
question
for
the
factfinder.
do
we
believe
the
testimony
of
the
defendant,
do
we
take
the
testimony
of
everyone
else
and
draw
the
inference
that
the
gun
was
loaded?
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
my
position
would
be
that
if
the
evidence
is
conclusive
that
the
weapon
was
not
loaded,
no.
but,
if
it
is
a
question
of
fact--
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
--i
think
the
matter
could
be
submitted
to
the
jury
with
the
instruction
that
from
the
evidence
you
have
heard,
if
you
disbelieve
the
defendant
and
believe
the
other
testimony,
you
would
be
allowed
to
infer
that
the
weapon
was
loaded
and
operable.
nevertheless,
you
must
find
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
it
was
a
dangerous
weapon.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
yes,
sir,
it
was.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
it
was
not.
there
was
no
jury
in
this
case.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
i
think
the
bennett
decision,
which
is
clear
in
its
instructions
that
the
weapon
is
dangerous,
period.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
it
does
not
appear
from
the
record
that
the
judge
said--
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
--i
don't
think
any
way.
i
think
the
judge
was
bound
by
the
fourth
circuit
decision
in
bennett
and
i
think
that
it
is
not
going
outside
the
record
to
say
that
at
the
beginning
of
the
proceeding
it
is
put
on
the
record
why
we
were
having
a
guilty
plea
as
to
some--
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
--but,
in
this
case--
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
--he
is
the
trier
of
fact
in
this
case,
but
because
of
the
bennett
decision
there
was
no
factual
matter
for
him
to
decide.
it
was
taken
away
by
the
bennett
decision.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
he
did
not
say
that
in
those
words.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
we
know
he
did
that
because
it
is
explained
in
the
record
that
the
purpose
of
the
proceeding
was
to
test
bennett.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
at
the
beginning...
in
the
joint
appendix
at
the
beginning
of
the
trial
proceeding
which
is
on
page
seven
and
eight
and
i
think
it
is
inferred
again
on
page
eleven
at
the
top.
"the
reason
we
are
here
is
to
preserve
the
issue
of
law
that
under
bennett
the
government
has
no
burden
of
proof
at
all
concerning
the
fact
the
gun
be
loaded
or
not.
"
that
under
the
bennett
decision--
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
--well,
i
would
prefer--
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
--well,
i
would
prefer
that
in
that
case
there
is
a
dangerous
weapon.
fortuitously
it
didn't
work.
just
as
if
there
were
bullet-proof
glass
that
was
up
and
the
bullet
didn't
penetrate
the
glass.
that
does
not
render
the
weapon
not
a
dangerous
weapon.
i
don't
think
the
question
is--
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
--the
weapon
that
jams
when
used?
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
i
think
there
that
that
weapon
is
much
more
dangerous
than
the
weapon
that
can't
work
at
all.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
because
the
weapon
that
jams
when
used
is
nevertheless
a
weapon
which,
when
exhibited,
was
a
weapon
that
could
actually
inflict
the
harm
threatened
until
the
fortuitous
accident
of
jamming.
whereas,
an
unloaded
weapon
cannot
inflict
the
harm
threatened
at
all
unless
it
is
used
in
a
different
manner
and
then
you
look
at
the
manner
in
which
it
was
used
to
determine
if
it
is
dangerous.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
i
agree.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
i
agree.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
i
say
that
that
is
a
violation
of
section
(a),
the
assault.
that
does
not
also
amount
to
a
violation
of
section
(d).
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
the
purpose
of
the
assault
was
to
take
money
by
intimidation.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
that
is
exactly
what
happened
which
is
why
mr.
mclaughlin
plead
guilty
to
taking
money
by
intimidation.
if
that
is
also
a
violation
of
section
(d),
then
there
is
no
distinction
between
(a)
and
(d).
taking
money
by
intimidation,
the
source
of
the
intimidation
being
an
unloaded
weapon,
is
also
taking
money
by
a
dangerous
weapon
and
i
don't
think
that
is
warranted
on
the
wording
of
the
statute
or
on
the
history
of
the
statute.
and,
for
the
fourth
circuit
to
establish
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
i
think,
is
a
violation
of
winship.
if
congress
wants
to
make
that
change,
it
can
make
that
change.
if
the
government
had
put
924(c)
at
the
bottom
of
the
indictment
instead
of
2113(d),
we
wouldn't
be
here.
the
effect
of
bennett
is
to
allow
the
government
to
charge
the
use
of
a
dangerous
weapon
and
convict
for
use
of
a
dangerous
weapon
merely
on
the
display
of
a
weapon,
loaded
or
unloaded.
i
think
absent
the
congressional
definition
to
that
effect,
that
action
in
bennett
is
wrong.
unless
there
are
further
questions,
i
will
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
thank
you.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
agree
that
it
makes
sense
to
punish
robbers
who
display
guns.
that
is
why
we
have
924(c)
which
punishes
robbers
who
display
guns.
2113(d)
punishes
the
use
of
a
dangerous
weapon
during
an
assault
committed
during
a
bank
robbery
or
used
to
place
life
in
jeopardy
during
a
bank
robbery.
this
court
referred
to
the
legislative
history
of
2113(d)
in
its
footnote
in
simpson
and
it
explained
that
dangerous
weapon
applies
equally
to
the
assaultive
and
jeopardy
clauses
and
it
notes
that
2113(d)
was
enacted
to
fight
gangsterism
in
the
1930's.
what
was
clearly
in
the
mind
of
congress
was
to
punish
people
who
use
weapons
that
can
shoot
people,
that
can
explode,
and
that
weapons
that
look
like
them
are
not
punished
as
devices
but
are
punished
under
the
fear
section
of
that
statute.
the
wisconsin
experience
is
instructive.
what
should
happen
is
that
congress
should
determine
that
2113(d)
encompasses
unloaded
handguns,
not
the
fourth
circuit.
what
the
fourth
circuit
has
done
is
foreclose
the
question
entirely.
there
is
a
factual
question
to
be
decided
during
trials
and
it
should
be
decided
there
during
the
trial.
what
the
government
would
have
this
court
do
is
cut
dangerousness
from
this
statute.
thank
you
very
much.
