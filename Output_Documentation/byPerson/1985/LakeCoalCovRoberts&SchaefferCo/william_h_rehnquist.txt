justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
polly,
i
take
it
from
one
of
your
answers
to
one
of
justice
white's
questions...
tell
me
if
i
am
wrong
in
saying
i
take
it
that
you
would
agree
that
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
discretion
in
the
district
court.
that
he
might
decide
to
stay
the
federal
action,
he
might
not
decide
to
stay
the
federal
action
and
conceivably
he
could
be
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
whichever
thing
he
did.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
is
the
site
of
the
nearest
federal
courthouse?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
talked
to
one
of
your
colleagues
in
kentucky
who
had
argued
thermtron
here
and
asked
him,
after
thermtron
was
decided,
why
he
was
interested
in
getting
into
a
federal
court
rather
than
the
kentucky
state
court
and
he
said
in
a
federal
court
you
can
draw
your
jurors
from
a
large
part
of
the
state,
whereas
if
you
are
a
state
court,
it
is
just
the
particular
county
you
are
in.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
certainly
there
is
an
appeal
from
the
circuit
court
of
letcher
county
within
the
kentucky
judicial
system.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
saying
that
the
court
of
appeals
took
a
contrary
view
to
the
district
court
when
the
district
court
remanded
or
what
were
the
arguments
made
at
the
district
court
as
to
the
grounds
for
removal
and
remanding?
was
the
fraudulent
joinder
point
argued
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
district
court
remanded.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does
that
seem
to
you
like
a
sensible
way
to
run
a
judicial
system?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you
say
no,
it
is
not
a
sensible
way
to
run
a
judicial
system,
then
there
must
be
something
wrong
with
the
doctrines
you
urging...
and
say
that
is
what
should
have
happened.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
he
is
entitled
to
a
federal
forum
come
hell
or
high
water
regardless
of
totally
duplicative
litigation
in
the
state
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and,
you
think
congress
would
have
been
deeply
pleased
with
this
spectacle
of
litigation,
identical
litigation,
running
its
course
both
in
the
kentucky
state
court
and
in
the
federal
district
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
combs,
you
said
you
thought
constitutionally
there
could
be
no
discretion.
do
you
mean
that
congress
could
not
have
said
when
it
passed
the
statutes
for
the
purpose
of
conferring
jurisdiction
on
the
district
court
that
the
district
court
should
have
jurisdiction
to
stay
the
case
where
there
would
be
duplicative
litigation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
at
any
rate,
it
is
not
any
constitutional
doctrine
that
you...
congress
couldn't
have
achieved
this--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--where
do
we
find
that
in
the
constitution?
