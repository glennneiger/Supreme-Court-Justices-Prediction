justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
polly,
what
has
happened
to
the
state
court
action
now.
it
proceeded
i
understood.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
see.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
what
if
there
weren't
subcontractors
who
were
parties
to
the
state
action
and
the
federal
court
action
is
filed
first?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
though
only
state
issues
were
involved?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
the
removal
power
is
a
factor
to
be
considered
whether
or
not
an
action
in
a
state
court
could
be
removed
to
the
federal
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
where
the
subcontractors
are
parties
in
a
state
court
action
in
this
case
no
removal
is
possible
under
the
federal
removal
statute,
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
polly,
can
a
plaintiff
in
a
state
court
action
just
name
anyone
who
is
a
resident
of
the
state,
however
fraudulently
and
thereby
defeat
the
right
of
someone
to
remove
to
federal
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
can't
the
district
court
look
at
whether
there
is
a
fraudulent
joinder
of
someone
in
the
state
court
action?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
combs,
aren't
the
concerns
that
are
reflected
by
diversity
jurisdiction
satisfied
fully
by
the
option
of
removing
a
case
that
has
been
filed
in
a
state
court
to
a
federal
court
under
the
removal
power
of
the
statute,
and
if
it
turns
out
that
removal
is
not
possible
because
of
the
absence
of
diversity,
complete
diversity
in
the
state
case,
do
you
think
congress
still
intended
that
the
defendant
who
can't
remove
should
be
able
to
exercise
diversity
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
am
not
sure
that
this
court
has
ruled
on
that
actually.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but,
shouldn't
we
look
at
what
congress
has
addressed
in
the
framework
of
the
removal
power
and
the
diversity
jurisdiction
statute,
look
at
them
together,
because
congress
has
spoken
to
both
issues
and
don't
they
relate
to
each
other?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if
removal
had
been
possible
under
the
circumstances
of
the
case?
suppose
no
subcontractors
had
been
named,
but
instead
of
removing
the
action
to
the
nearest
federal
court
in
kentucky,
you
had
instead
instituted
a
new
diversity
action
in
the
federal
court
in
illinois
to
be
closer
to
your
corporate
headquarters.
would
that
have
been
all
right
too
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
don't
you
think
the
congressman
might
respond
and
tell
you
we
have
spoken
and
we
have
written
the
removal
statute
and
it
is
linked
to
the
diversity
statute
and
we
have
denied
the
right
of
appeal
from
an
order
under
the
removal
power
and
that
is
it,
we
have
spoken?
now,
you
courts
have
to
implement
these
statutes
together
and
make
them
work.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
read
them
together.
i
mean,
is
there
anything
wrong
with
that
and
with
the
argument
that,
indeed,
congress
has
a
right
to
speak
and
it
did
speak.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
was
more
a
comment
than
a
question.
thank
you.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
in
your
view,
cases
from
this
court
like
the
younger
or
pullman
abstention
cases
are
all
erroneously
decided?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
colorado
river
factors
case
as
well.
