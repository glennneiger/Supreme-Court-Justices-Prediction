stevens
which
would
be
res
judicata,
if
the
kentucky
trial
proceedings
ended
first,
but
the
federal
court
went
ahead...
say
they
vacated
the
stay
or
something...
and
the
federal
that
upheld
the
process
ran
its
course
first.
would
the
federal
case
be
res
judicata?
i
don't
know
how
fast
your
kentucky
appellate
process
works,
but
assume
it
is
slower
than
the
federal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
it
is
on
appeal?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no,
no.
even
if
the
state
court
judgment
is
not
final
in
the
sense
that
there
is
review
pending
in
the
appellate
court
of
kentucky.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
combs,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
that
related
to
what
justice
o'connor
was
asking
you?
you
contend,
as
i
understand,
and
you
persuaded
the
court
of
appeals,
that
there
was
no
arguably
valid
claim
involving
the
subcontractors.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
if
you
had
been
successful
in
persuading
the
district
court
of
that
effect
at
the
time
of
your
effort
to
remove,
would
you
not
have
been
successful
in
removing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then,
does
it
not
appear
that
the
effect
of
what
you
have
done
is
to
get
appellate
review
of
the
district
court's...
as
you
would
say...
erroneous
decision
on
removal?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
is
it
not
true
that...
not
probable
at
least
that
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
agreed
with
the
district
court's
remand
order
and
thought
that
these
parties
were
genuine...
there
was
a
genuine
separate
lawsuit
against
the
two
subcontractors
it
would
have
decided
the
appeal
differently?
it
seems
to
me
the
whole
question
of
where
you
litigate
turns
on
the
bona
fides
of
the
claims
against
the
subcontractors.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
is
troubling
me...
it
seems
to
me
that
congress
is
giving
us
conflicting
signals.
on
one
hand,
they
say
you
have
got
a
right
to
a
federal
forum
in
a
diversity
case,
on
the
other
hand,
they
say
if
you
try
to
remove
and
you
fail
you
don't
get
any
appeal
from
an
order
denying
removal
or
remanding
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
wouldn't
have
been
ridiculous,
but
it
would,
in
effect,
say
that
a
decision
on
a
question
like
this
is
lodged
in
the
district
court
and
not
normally
going
to
be
reviewable
and
if
you
happen
to
lose
maybe
a
different
district
judge
would
have
decided
it
otherwise.
in
other
words,
i
think
there
is
a
close
question
on
your
removal.
it
is
not
perfectly
clear
he
was
right
in
denying
you
removal.
