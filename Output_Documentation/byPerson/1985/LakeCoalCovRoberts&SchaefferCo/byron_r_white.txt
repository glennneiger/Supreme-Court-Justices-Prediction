justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
think
the
federal
court
should
have
done
if
roberts
had
to
come
to
federal
court
first?
it
started
the
suit,
started
the
litigation,
and
lake
coal
counterclaimed
in
the
federal
court
and
then
lake
coal
went
to
the
state
court
and
started
this
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
after
the
suit
starts
in
the
federal
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
lake
coal
starts
a
case
of
its
own
in
a
state
court
and
then
moves
to
federal
court
to
dismiss.
should
the
federal
court
grant
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
in
my
example
you
would
be
arguing
for
the
same
result,
mainly
the
federal
court
should
dismiss
the
action.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
in
this
case,
except
for
the
other
parties
that
were
in
the
state
suit,
if
they
hadn't
been
made
parties
in
the
state
suit,
but
the
federal
court
case
was
started
later,
you
would
think
the
federal
court
case
could
go
ahead,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
district
court
had
refused
to
dismiss
the
case...
he
dismissed,
didn't
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
he
stayed.
he
didn't
dismiss.
justice
white
he
stayed.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
he
had
refused
to
stay?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
i
thought
you...
you
mean,
he
would
not
have
had
the
discretion
to
entertain
the
suit.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
would
have
had
to
stay.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
his
discretion
would
not
have
extended
so
far
as
to...
as
not
to
stay
in
this
case.
justice
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
lost
on
the
piecemeal
litigation
factor
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
said
they
didn't
think
there
would
be
piecemeal
litigation.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
we
have
to
second
guess
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
they
said
you
didn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
do
we
have
to
second
guess
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know.
the
issue
is...
one
of
the
factors
you
consider
is
whether
piecemeal
litigation
will
be
created.
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that,
no,
it
would
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
therefore,
there
is
no
piecemeal
litigation.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't...
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
thought
piecemeal
litigation
would
occur,
they
might
have
stayed
the
case.
justice
white
but,
they
didn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
stay
in
the
federal
court
had
not
been
granted?
i
take
it
your
position
would
be
that
the
two
suits
should
go
on
simultaneously.
justice
byron
r.
white
litigating
the
same
issue
in
each
court
and
whoever...
whichever
court
arrived
at
judgment
first
would
then
conclude
the
other.
