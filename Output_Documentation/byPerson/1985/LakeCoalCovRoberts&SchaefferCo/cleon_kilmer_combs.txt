mr.
cleon
kilmer
combs
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
make
it
clear
that
roberts
&
schaefer
initially
perceived
its
right
to
a
federal
forum
when
this
action
was
first
initiated
in
the
state
court.
we
have
pursued
that
view
diligently
right
up
to
this
court.
we
sought
to
remove
for
the
very
reason
mr.
polly
mentioned.
we
certainly
did
not
want
to
leave
any
stone
unturned
and
weigh
that
right
and
we
did
not.
upon
remand
we
immediately
followed
this
court's
admonition
in
colorado
river.
moses
h.
cone
instituted
a
separate
federal
action
to
exercise
our
right
to
a
federal
forum
which
we
conceived
was
granted
to
us
by
the
congress.
mr.
cleon
kilmer
combs
i
certainly
do,
your
honor,
and
i
think
this
court
has
so
held
in
a
number
of
cases.
i
don't
know
that
the
factual
situation
is
true,
but--
mr.
cleon
kilmer
combs
--i
don't
know
of
any
instance
where
that
particular
factual
situation
has
existed,
but
the
rule
of
concurrent
jurisdiction,
the
pending
of
parallel
suits
in
state
and
federal
court,
has
been
in
existence
for
further
back
than
i
would
like
to
concede.
mr.
cleon
kilmer
combs
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because,
as
we
pointed
out
a
moment
ago,
lawyers
are
a
rather
ingenious
group
and
many
procedural
situations
can
be
developed
to
defeat
diversity
jurisdiction
as
was
true
in
this
case.
and,
the
mere
defeat
of
removal
jurisdiction
does
not
mean
that
the
congress
did
not
intend
for
that
participant,
that
party,
that
citizens
of
another
state,
not
to
have
a
right
to
a
federal
forum.
mr.
cleon
kilmer
combs
there
we
have
the
microsoft
case
i
believe
it
is
and
certainly...
i
think
the
action
in
illinois
would
be
permissible
as
concurrent
federal
jurisdiction,
but
we
have
a
tool
to
deal
with
that
and
that
is
the
right
to
transfer
that
case
to
the
most
convenient
forum
which
i
think
it
would
be
its
return
to
pikeville.
i
would
see
no
reason
to
dismiss
or
even
stay
that
case,
but
just
simply
transfer
it
to
pikeville.
at
least
that
would
be
my
thinking
on
it,
your
honor.
now,
the
problem
that
i
am
having,
the
initial
problem,
and
it
is
a
problem
that
bothers
the
court
of
appeals,
was
the
shifting
of
the
burden.
the
district
court
imposed
upon
roberts
&
schaefer
the
burden
of
showing
good
cause
for
exercising
a
right
to
a
federal
forum
granted
by
the
congress.
and,
in
our
view,
a
right
to
a
federal
forum
granted
by
the
congress,
federal
jurisdiction,
is
not
subject
to
any
presumption
which
must
be
overcome.
the
court
of
appeals
so
held
and
we
suggest
that
that
is
the
proper
rule.
mr.
cleon
kilmer
combs
yes,
we
do,
your
honor.
mr.
cleon
kilmer
combs
we
think
so,
your
honor.
that
is
why
we
asserted
it.
mr.
cleon
kilmer
combs
i
suggest
not,
your
honor,
because
if
there
is
parallel
federal
jurisdiction,
concurrent
jurisdiction...
this
case
is
a
case
which
was
instituted
in
the
federal
court
under
a
statute
granting
us
a
federal
forum
and
the
appeal
is
from
that
corner
and
not
from
the
other.
mr.
cleon
kilmer
combs
i
don't
really
think
it
does,
your
honor,
because
certainly
the
question
of
the
subcontractors
is...
the
main
thrust
of
this
case
and
this
claim
really
is
this
contract--
mr.
cleon
kilmer
combs
--between
these
two
parties
that
we
have
before
us
here
today.
and,
the
question
is
roberts
&
schaefer's
right
to
a
federal
forum
by
virtue
of
diversity
to
determine
that
controversy.
and,
i
don't
think
that...
what
you
are
referring
to,
i
take
it,
is
whether
that
is
sufficient
exceptional
circumstances.
i
submit
that
it
is
not.
mr.
cleon
kilmer
combs
that
would
be
the
effect.
actually,
if
that
were
held,
then
we
would
be
denied
on
both
ends
of
the
spectrum.
we
would
be
denied
relief
both
ways
and
it
would
have
been
ridiculous
for
me
to
attempt
to
remove.
i
should
have
just
gone
ahead
and
immediately
filed.
mr.
cleon
kilmer
combs
i
think
that
is
true,
your
honor,
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
heavy
burden
was
on
lake
coal
company.
if
they
wanted
a
stay,
a
heavy
burden
was
to
come
in
and
establish
in
the
record
that
this
would
cause
multiplicity
of
litigation.
and,
the
record
is
virtually
silent
on
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
is
silent.
that
burden
was
not
carried.
and,
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
that
and
spoke
to
it
and
held
expressly
that
it
was
not
met.
and,
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
put
that
to
rest
at
that
point.
there
is
no
claim
of
abstention
here.
we
don't
have
any
berford
claim,
we
don't
have
any
younger
claim.
we
do
have
an
exceptional
circumstances
claim.
the
in
personam
was
addressed,
but
actually
what
was
addressed
is
merely
left,
and
as
we
know,
the
point
where
a
federal
court
draws
the
line
and
refuses
to
act
in
a
race
case
is
where
the
race...
the
property
is
in
the
actual
possession
of
a
state
court
and
is
being
administered
by
the
state
court.
certainly,
under
those
circumstances,
a
federal
court
should
and
will
abstain.
mr.
cleon
kilmer
combs
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
cleon
kilmer
combs
you
would
have
the
proverbial
race
to
the
judgment.
we
had
a
race
to
the
courthouse
and
i
lost.
i
guess
we
would
have
a
race
to
the
judgment.
mr.
cleon
kilmer
combs
no,
your
honor,
but
we
do
have
a
federal
system
and--
mr.
cleon
kilmer
combs
--i
think
the
compelling
issue
is
whether
a
litigant
is
entitled
to
a
federal
forum.
mr.
cleon
kilmer
combs
i
suggest,
your
honor,
that
is
a
political
argument
as
most
of
these
things
are
and
really
addresses
itself
to
the
congress.
mr.
cleon
kilmer
combs
i
would
hope
the
congress
would
not
be
pleased,
your
honor,
but
then
my
remedy...
the
only
remedy
i
know
is
to
write
my
congressman
because
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
is
vested
exclusively
in
the
congress.
i
would
like
to
speak
to
that
later.
mr.
cleon
kilmer
combs
your
honor,
i
don't
read
the
diversity...
the
original
diversity
statute
and
the
removal
of
diversity
statute
as
being...
you
can
choose
one
or
the
other--
mr.
cleon
kilmer
combs
--i
am
sorry,
your
honor,
i
am
having
trouble
following
your
last
question.
mr.
cleon
kilmer
combs
i
am
suggesting
that
the
congress
has
said
you
may
remove
if
it
is
removable.
if
it
is
not,
and
you
have
diversity
jurisdiction
otherwise,
you
may
institute
a
separate
parallel
proceeding.
that
is
what
we
have
done.
and,
we
suggest
that
once
the
congress
determines
that
jurisdiction
does
exist,
that
there
is
the
often
spoken,
unflagging
obligation
to
proceed
and
we
think
that
is
what
should
have
happened
in
this
case.
now,
i
would
like
to
address
for
a
moment,
if
i
may,
the
exceptional
circumstances
situation.
and,
i
am
troubled
by
exceptional
circumstances
because
they
are
in
the
eye
of
the
beholder.
it
all
depends
on
whose
circumstances
they
are
and
it
becomes
entangled
and
enmeshed
with
discretion.
and,
i
recognize
for
a
lawyer
to
address
a
court
and
suggest
that
there
is
no
discretion
is
hazardous
at
best.
but,
i
suggest
that
constitutionally
there
is
no
discretion
with
regard
to
jurisdiction.
discretion
is
an
innate
part
of
jurisdiction.
jurisdiction,
in
my
view,
is
a
mandate
to
a
court
to
act
and
adjudicate
an
adjudicable
controversy.
that
is
what
we
have
here.
mr.
cleon
kilmer
combs
i
think
they
could
very
well
have
done
so,
your
honor,
and
maybe
that
is
the
answer.
but,
there
again,
that
is
a
political
decision.
mr.
cleon
kilmer
combs
no.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
there
is
presently
a
constitutional
prohibition
against
exercising
a
discretion.
mr.
cleon
kilmer
combs
you
find
it
in
the
area
where
matters
of
jurisdiction
are
withheld
and
granted
to
the
congress.
and,
when
the
congress
determines
jurisdiction,
the
congress
determines
whether
jurisdiction
shall
exist
in
this
case,
whether
jurisdiction
shall
not
exist
in
the
next
case,
whether
it
shall
exist
with
discretion
to
stay
in
the
third
case.
in
other
words,
the
entire
spectrum
of
jurisdiction
power
rests
with
the
congress
and
not
with
any
court.
mr.
cleon
kilmer
combs
no,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
cleon
kilmer
combs
--addressing
that
specifically,
i
view...
of
course,
younger,
berford
and
the
other
abstention
cases
are
bottomed
on
the
concept
of
the
separation
of
the
federal
government
and
state
government
and
the
operation
of
the
state
government,
the
non-interference,
the
non-intrusion
of
the
federal
government
into
the
vital
affairs
of
the
state.
and,
i
agree
with
those
cases.
now,
when
i
start
having
a
little
trouble
is
with
colorado
river
and
arizona,
because
in
colorado
river
and
in
arizona
the
court
used
the
exceptional
circumstances
test.
in
my
mind,
exceptional
circumstances
is
almost
tantamount
to
discretion.
it
may
be
discretion,
although
the
court
very
pointedly
says
that
it
is
the
narrowest
of
discretion.
and,
again,
i
am
back
to
the
constitutional
problem,
the
jurisdictional
problem,
of
discretion.
certainly
in
the
declaratory
judgment
act,
the
brillhart
case,
the
congress
granted
the
discretion
and
the
court
exercised
it
and
this
court
upheld
it.
so,
i
would
suggest
that
colorado
river
and
arizona
maybe
are
closer
akin,
or
what
we
in
kentucky
call
kissing
cousins,
of
berford
and
some
of
the
civil
counterparts
of
younger
where
the
state
has
a
vital
interest,
because
having
practiced
for
a
short
time
in
arizona,
i
know
what
water
rights
mean.
and,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
arizona,
that
is
a
very...
i
forget
the
terminology,
but
it
is
unique.
and,
here,
colorado
and
arizona
were
attempting
to
establish
through
the
state
court
system
a
pattern
of
water
rights
which
this
court
held
provided
exceptional
circumstances.
i
would
suggest
that
maybe
more
appropriate
it
should
have
been
intrusion
into
areas
that
should
be
reserved
for
the
states.
and,
i
would
suggest
that
if...
i
don't
think
it
is
a
discretion,
but
i
think
the
federal
courts,
when
they
come
into
an
area
of
that
sort,
they
should
look
into
it
and
make
a
determination,
a
finding
of
fact,
if
you
please,
not
a
discretion,
but
a
finding
of
fact
as
to
whether
there
will
be
an
intrusion
into
the
vital
functions
of
the
state
which
might
well
be
contrary
to
the
comity
between
the
federal
government
and
the
states.
now,
the
state
law
issue,
i
think,
should
be
put
to
rest
and
i
think
can
be
put
to
rest
very
quickly.
that
is
what
erie
is
all
about.
that
is
what
the
diversity
statute
is
all
about.
if
we
were
to
stay
every
case
because
it
is
based
on
state
law,
we
would
repeal
the
diversity
statute
and
we
all
know
that
is
an
area
reserved
for
the
congress.
conservation
of
judicial
time:
that
is
extremely
interesting
to
me
because
ten
years
ago
this
very
month
i
was
standing
here
in
the
same
spot
defending
judge
hermensdorfer
and
judge
hermensdorfer
didn't
have
time
and
he
was
serious
and
he
meant
it.
but,
this
court
wisely
determined
that
the
congress
had
spoken,
that
the
conferring
of
jurisdictions
in
diversity
of
removal
cases
was
a
mandate
of
the
congress
which
he
should
have
heeded
and
ordered
him
to
heed
it.
certainly,
these
things
are
sometimes
wasteful,
waste
of
time,
waste
of
money.
maybe
there
should
be
better
ways,
but
again
that
addresses
itself
to
the
congress
and
not
to
us.
another
thing
that
bothers
me
is...
of
course,
the
microsoftware
case
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
i
misnamed
it.
another
matter
i
would
like
to
cover
briefly
is
diversity
jurisdiction
and
its
relationship
to
federal
questions,
civil
rights,
whatever.
i
mention
in
my
brief
and
i
would
like
to
emphasize
now
that
i
know
of
no
jurisdictional
pecking
order,
i
know
of
no
jurisdictional
statute
that
says
diversity
shall
be
tried
first,
second,
or
third,
whether
it
should
be
number
one
or
number
ten
on
the
list
of
one
to
ten.
and,
i
think
in
the
absence
of
a
congressional
expression,
we
must
treat
each
jurisdictional...
each
conferring
in
jurisdiction
as
a
congressional
mandate
of
at
least
equal
equality.
the
jurisdiction
that
i
advocate
today
happens
to
be
a
senior
citizen,
the
most
senior
of
all,
i
suppose,
but
certainly
the
mere
factor
that
it
may
have
here
and
may
not
even
be
in
great
favor
in
a
lot
of
places,
doesn't
mean
that
it
is
to
be
condemned
or
moved
to
the
back
of
the
bus.
certainly,
as
a
senior
citizen,
it
is
entitled
to
as
much
consideration
and
is
entitled
to
go
forward
with
at
least
the
same
deliberate
speed
to
adjudication
as
any
other
jurisdiction
unless
the
congress
mandates
otherwise
as
it
has
in
a
few
instances.
it
distresses
me
to
see
judgments
made
by
the
individual
districts
or
even
the
circuits
as
to
which
should
take
precedence,
which
should
be
first,
which
should
be
second,
which
should
ninth,
which
should
be
tenth.
i
think
that
is
a
political
decision
for
the
congress
and
not
for
the
courts.
i
would
suggest
that
all
jurisdictional
mandates
move
forward
equally
unless
and
until
the
congress
dictates
otherwise.
i
notice
the
colorado
district
in
local
rule
200
says
that
diversity
actions
will
be
given
the
lowest
priority
and
will
be
heard
and
tried
when,
as,
and
if
time
permits.
again,
i
suggest
that
is
a
judgment
for
the
congress
and
not
for
the
courts.
i
am
suggesting
that
the
sixth
circuit
has
decided
the
case
correctly,
has
decided
that
the
congressional
mandate
of
the
congress
should
be
enforced
and
has
properly
reversed
the
district
court
with
directions
to
exercise
jurisdiction.
if
the
court
has
nothing
further,
may
i
be
excused?
