mr.
ronald
glen
polly
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
matter
is
whether
exceptional
circumstances
exist
to
justify
the
stay,
referring
to
the
current
state
action
in
this
pure
diversity
action.
in
the
san
carlos
apache
case,
the
dismissal
was
upheld
because
the
state's
suits
were
adequate
to
quantify
the
rights,
water
rights
of
the
indians.
number
two,
they
were
carrying
amendment
policies
irrelevant;
number
three,
the
state
expertise
and
administrative
machinery
is
adequate
and
set
up.
the
infancy
of
the
federal
suits,
particularly
the
judicial
bias
against
piecemeal
litigation
and
convenience
to
the
parties
involving
duplication
of
issues
and
effort.
the
reasoning
mentioned
there
to
some
great
extent
was
that
the
concurrent
federal
proceedings
as
duplicative
and
wasteful,
generating
additional
litigation
through
inconsistent
disposition
of
property.
and,
number
two,
the
concurrent
proceedings
creates
a
serious
potential
for
spawning
an
unseemly
and
destructive
waste
to
see
which
forum
can
resolve
the
same
issues
first
prejudicial
to
the
possibility
of
recent
decision-making
by
either
forum.
in
the
moses
cone
hospital
case,
the
stay
reversal
was
affirmed
because
the
piecemeal
litigation
was
not
avoided
as
to
the
architect
in
the
state
court.
the
priority
measured
by
progress
in
the
suits
was
not
in
favor
of
stay.
the
federal
law
was
the
rule
of
decision
on
the
merits
and
the
state
court
action
was
inadequate
to
protect
the
rights.
the
court--
mr.
ronald
glen
polly
--the
state
court
action
is
set
for
trial
november
4.
mr.
ronald
glen
polly
the
court
was
guided
in
the
moses
cone
case
by
the
federal
policy
and
law
to
not
delay
arbitration
under
the
federal
arbitration
act.
the
court
noted
specifically
that
vexatious
or
reactive
nature
of
suits
may
influence
the
decision
as
to
whether
to
defer
to
the
concurrent
state
action.
this
occurred
not
only
in
the
moses
cone
case
in
the
court
of
appeals,
but
also
in
the
calvert
case
and
was
mentioned
by
this
court
as
having
considerable
merit.
in
the
colorado
river
case,
the
dismissal
was
upheld
because
the
mccarran
amendment
federal
policy
to
avoid
piecemeal
litigation
of
water
rights
in
a
river
system.
number
two,
the
absence
of
proceedings
beyond
the
complaint;
number
three,
particularly
the
extensive
involvement
of
state
water
rights
involving
numerous
defendants
and
the
distance
between
state
court
and
denver
and
the
division
seven
location
of
the
size
of
the
water
right;
and
number
five,
the
existing
participation
of
u.s.
in
other
similar
state
proceedings.
there,
the
particular
language
relating
to
the
basis
for
justifying
the
stay
derives.
the
court
said
the
issue
must
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
wise
judicial
administration,
giving
regard
to
conservation
of
judicial
resources
and
comprehensive
disposition
of
litigation.
the
court
noted
the
virtual
unflagging
obligation
to
exercise
jurisdiction.
the
court
also
noted
that
the
reasons
of
wise
judicial
administration
are
more
limited
and
exceptional
and
the
court
indicated
that
there
must
be
a
weighing
of
factors
with
only
the
clearest
of
justifications.
the
scales
were
described
as
consider
the
obligation
to
exercise
as
opposed
to
factors
counseling
against
exercise.
the
factors
in
this
case
are,
number
one,
the
priority
of
assuming
jurisdiction
of
property,
the
question
of
in
rem
application.
this
question
has
never
been
specifically
an
issue.
roberts
&
schaefer
says
the
state
action
is
in
personam
and
i
simply
point
out
that
that
was
deliberately
so
by
roberts
schaefer.
mr.
ronald
glen
polly
justice
white,
i
believe
that
the
cases
indicate
that
it
would
not
matter
if
the
same
circumstances
exist.
mr.
ronald
glen
polly
right.
mr.
ronald
glen
polly
the
existence
of
the
state
action...
it
is
assumed
that
lake
would
file
the
state
action
as
well
after
the
federal
action.
so,
the
order
in
which
the
two
were
filed
does
not
determine--
mr.
ronald
glen
polly
--so
long
as...
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
ronald
glen
polly
so
long
as
the
piecemeal
litigation
situation
exists
in
the
state
court
where
the
subcontractors
are
parties
and
they
are
not
parties
in
the
federal
court
action.
i
pointed
out
that
the
in
rem
question--
mr.
ronald
glen
polly
--i
think
in
that
event
we
do
not
have
piecemeal
litigation
questions
and
in
all
likelihood
the
state
action...
the
federal
action
would
stand.
mr.
ronald
glen
polly
yes.
mr.
ronald
glen
polly
well,
i
think
there
is
argument
under
the
cases
for
the
position
that
the
federal
court
under
the
test,
because
state
law
applies
in
all
the
other
factors
indicate
in
favor
of
stay.
i
think
that
it
could
be
decided
in
that
manner
in
the
discretion
of
the
court.
but--
mr.
ronald
glen
polly
--i
think
yes.
i
think
one
of
the
cases
indicated
that
lower
court
cases...
in
fact,
where
removal
was
possible
it
was
more
indicated
that
the
federal
action
should
be
stayed,
because
there,
instead
of
filing
a
separate
suit,
removal
could
have
been
achieved.
mr.
ronald
glen
polly
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor.
the
point
is
the
r&s
attempted
removal
and
the
federal
court
remanded
the
case
to
the
state
court
and
then
six
months
after
the
state
court
action
was
stopped
the
second
federal
court
action
was
filed
by
roberts
&
schaefer.
there
is
indication
here
of
defensive
tactical
maneuvers
on
the
part
of
roberts
&
schaefer.
occupy
lake
with
the
removal,
then
when
the
removal
fails,
attempt
a
second
action.
i
started
to
point
out
before
the
questions
were
asked
that
with
respect
to
in
rem
roberts
&
schaefer
deliberately
did
not
file
its
lien
in
its
counterclaim
in
the
state
court
and
did
not
amend
that
counterclaim
until
after
the
district
judge
had
ruled.
mr.
ronald
glen
polly
i
think
that
is
the
case,
justice
rehnquist.
yes,
i
think
that
is
the
case.
the
indication--
mr.
ronald
glen
polly
--yes,
he
stayed.
mr.
ronald
glen
polly
no.
mr.
ronald
glen
polly
he
stayed.
mr.
ronald
glen
polly
i
think
that
would
have
been
subject
to
appeal
as
well.
mr.
ronald
glen
polly
no.
mr.
ronald
glen
polly
in
my
opinion,
yes,
he
had
to
stay,
because
of
the
circumstances
of
the
piecemeal
litigation
in
the
state
court.
mr.
ronald
glen
polly
no,
no.
i
mean,
that
is
very
clear
under
these
cases.
the
question,
as
i
understood
from
justice
rehnquist,
was
setting
aside
the
piecemeal
litigation
question
did
the
federal
court
have
discretion
without
piecemeal
litigation.
that
is
the
question
i
thought
was
being
asked.
mr.
ronald
glen
polly
now,
when
you
say
what
indication
is
there
of
vexation
and
react
to
tactical
defense
of
maneuvers,
it
is
quite
obvious
that
when
the
in
rem
part
of
this
case
was
deliberately
avoided,
although
that
question
never
was
specifically
in
point
in
this
case,
because
the
counterclaim
in
the
state
court
did
not
incorporate
the
lien
that
was
incorporated
in
the
federal
action.
but,
certainly
as
soon
as
the
district
judge
made
his
decision,
the
counterclaim
was
amended
by
roberts
&
schaefer
to
include
the
lien.
the
judge
made
the
decision
in
july
and
immediately
after
he
made
the
decision
in
july
the
amended
counterclaim
was
filed.
i
don't
think
my
opposition
will
deny
that.
but,
nevertheless,
that
is
not
the
basis
for
the
district
judge's
decision.
the
second
issue
is
whether
there
was
any
inconvenience
of
the
federal
forum
and
we
don't
indicate
any
inconvenience
in
this
case.
the
federal
forum
is
in
the
adjoining
county,
a
similar
mountain
county.
in
fact,
where
the
hatfield
and
mccoy
feud
that
mr.
combs
speaks
about
in
his
brief
occurred.
mr.
ronald
glen
polly
pikeville,
pikeville,
kentucky.
pike
county
which
is
just
adjacent
and
in
as
deep
of
the
mountains
as
letcher
county
is.
what
roberts
&
schaefer
expected
to
achieve
in
its
claim
of...
late
claim
of
saying,
well,
we
have
the
basis
here
of
imagined
prejudice
in
the
local
court.
the
trial
in
the
federal
court
would
be
the
same
with
respect
to
the
jury.
mr.
ronald
glen
polly
well,
yes,
particular
county
in
state
court
but
in
a
large
part
of
the
same
locale
in
federal
court,
in
other
words,
come
from
other
counties.
as
i
understood
it,
roberts
&
schaefer's
comments
about
the
hatfield
and
mccoy
feud
was
almost
as
if
he
is
going
to
get
a
different
make
up
in
his
jury
down
at
federal
court
and
that
is
not
true.
the
third
question
is
the
priority
of
the
progress
of
the
suits
and,
of
course,
that
is
not
at
issue
in
this
case
at
the
time
the
decision
was
made
by
the
district
court,
but
we
do
know
now
that
the
progress
of
the
state
suit
is
relevant
in
terms
of
practical
application
in
this
case.
mr.
ronald
glen
polly
november
4th
of
this
year.
the
primary...
as
i
have
indicated,
the
primary
basis
for
upholding
the
stay
in
this
case
is
the
avoidance
of
piecemeal
litigation.
clearly
the
subcontractors
are
defendants
in
the
state
action
and
not
the
federal
action.
there
are
issues
that
require
the
same
proof
as
would
be
in
the
federal
action.
the
federal
action
would
in
no
wise
dispose
of
that
question
with
respect
to
the
subcontractors
and
the
same
proof
would
have
to
be
introduced
again
by
the
same
parties
and
cause
obviously
piecemeal
litigation.
mr.
ronald
glen
polly
justice
blackmun,
in
my
opinion
it
does.
the
state
action
would
be
res
judicata
so
long
as...
if
this
case
were
affirmed,
if
the
roberts
&
schaefer
attorney
could
not
obtain
quick
action
by
the
district
judge
and
attempt
to
get
an
adjudication
there
on
a
summary
judgment
motion,
if
summary
judgment
was
rendered
before
november
4,
then
the
state
action
would
be
moot.
mr.
ronald
glen
polly
oh,
yes.
oh,
yes,
in
the
sense
of
res
judicata
assuming
that
the
state
court
action
is
upheld
in
the
appeal.
i
mean,
we
were
discussing
this.
as
i
understood
it,
justice
rehnquist,
that
the
state
court
action
is
decided.
to
me,
that
mean
final...
if
it
is
finally
decided,
it
is
res
judicata.
of
course,
if
the
trial
verdict
was
appealed
and
reversed,
then
i
think
certainly
there
is
no
question
but
the
decision
of
this
court
is
very
relevant
and
in
no
wise
moot.
mr.
ronald
glen
polly
right.
in
my
opinion,
justice
stevens,
once
a
verdict
is
rendered
in
the
state
court,
that
judgment
becomes
res
judicata
with
respect
to
the
federal
proceedings
and
would
change
the
federal
proceedings.
mr.
ronald
glen
polly
the
federal
proceedings
would
not
even
be
subject
to
appeal
at
that--
mr.
ronald
glen
polly
--i
think,
yes.
the
res
judicata
effect
of
the
state
court
judgment
coming
first
would
affect
the
federal
proceedings
in
terms
of
a
stay
at
that
point
based
on
the
decision
there.
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
held
that
piecemeal
litigation
is
not
involved
because
lake
has
shown
no
arguably
valid
claim
against
the
non-signatory
subcontractors.
i
point
out
to
you
that
that
is
not
the
issue.
that
issue
was
never
argued
in
any
of
the
briefs,
was
never
presented,
no
cases
were
cited
by
either
side,
and
the
court
of
appeals
simply
got
the
wrong
issue.
the
point
is
that
the
case
exists
in
state
court
against
the
subcontractors
in
the
first
place.
it
is
not
a
question
of
whether
you
have
an
arguably
valid
claim
against
the
subcontractors,
but
whether
or
not
that
claim
exists
in
state
court.
and,
in
the
second
place,
in
our
petition
for
reconsideration,
we
pointed
out
to
the
court
that
certainly
under
state
law
we
have
an
arguably
valid
claim
against
the
subcontractors
based
on
third-party
beneficiary
law
and
the
alternative
cause
of
action
in
the
state
court
of
negligence
of
the
subcontractors.
my
point
was
how...
when
the
judge
asked
me
the
question
about
the
arguably
valid
claim,
my
statement
was
how
can
you
imagine
that
a
subcontractor
can
come
in
and
make
a
mess
of
a
wash
plant,
construct
it
defectively,
and
not
have
liability
to
the
people
that
own
the
wash
plant
and
is
having
the
work
done.
and,
that
is
the
cause
of
action.
but,
that
is
not
the
point.
that
question
was
raised
on
the
removal
action
and
was
turned
down
by
the
district
judge,
exhaustively
briefed.
the
point
in
the
removal
action
was
an
issue
but
not
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
were
exceptional
circumstances
to
justify
the
stay.
the
court
of
appeals
further
says
that
piecemeal
litigation
will
not
be
avoided
because
r&s
could
file
separate
actions
against
the
subcontractors.
and,
r&s
adds
that
lake
can
file
third-party
complaint
in
federal
action
against
the
subcontractors.
i
point
out
to
you
that
these
are
imaginary
cases
as
opposed
to
the
reality
of
the
present
circumstances.
it
is
not
in
this
case
which
cases
may
be
filed,
but
rather
what
cases
have
been
filed.
and,
on
the
basis
of
the
cases
that
exist,
this
court
should
make
a
decision
with
respect
to
piecemeal
litigation
whether
it
satisfactorily
justifies
the
stay
in
view
of
all
the
other
circumstances.
mr.
ronald
glen
polly
that
is
correct.
mr.
ronald
glen
polly
no.
mr.
ronald
glen
polly
no,
justice
white.
i
don't
think
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
said.
the
court
of
appeals
said,
number
one,
that
piecemeal
litigation
is
not
involved
because
lake
does
not
have
an
arguably
valid
claim
in
state
court
against
the
subcontractors.
if
we
have
an
arguably
valid
claim
or
if
the
arguably
valid
claim
is
not
relevant,
then
piecemeal
litigation...
that
is
the
basis
for
the
court
of
appeals.
they
didn't
say
piecemeal
litigation
didn't
occur
under
the
present
circumstances
if
we
have
an
arguably
valid
claim.
mr.
ronald
glen
polly
have
an
arguably
valid
claim?
mr.
ronald
glen
polly
no.
my
point
is
that
that
is
not
the
issue.
the
issue
is
that
we
do
have
a
case
in
state
court;
and,
number
two--
mr.
ronald
glen
polly
--exactly.
and,
we
have
a
case--
mr.
ronald
glen
polly
--the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
we
did
not
have
an
arguably
valid
case.
mr.
ronald
glen
polly
exactly.
and,
my
statement
to
you
is
that
that
ruling
by
the
court
of
appeals
was
not
the
issue.
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
the
case
exists,
not
whether
we
have
an
arguably
valid
claim.
the
case
does
exist.
mr.
ronald
glen
polly
yes.
mr.
ronald
glen
polly
they
didn't.
but,
the
reasoning
they
gave
as
to
saying
that
piecemeal
litigation
did
not
occur
were
not
at
issue.
mr.
ronald
glen
polly
no,
justice
o'connor.
that
is
not
the
point.
the
point
is
that
we
have
the
case
in
state
court
in
the
first
place
and
it
is
not--
mr.
ronald
glen
polly
--i
pointed
out,
justice
o'connor,
that
the
district
judge
did
do
that
on
removal.
but,
the
question
was
not
raised
in
the
issue
of
stay.
and,
the
court
of
appeals
sidetracked
to
that
issue
when
it
was
not
even
in
the
case
and
there
was
no
briefing
on
it.
to
just
come
out
of
the
blue
and
say
you
don't
have
a
valid
cause
of
action--
mr.
ronald
glen
polly
--yes,
the
fraudulent
joinder,
that
we
had
no
valid
cause
of
action.
mr.
ronald
glen
polly
absolutely.
said
that
we
did
have
an
arguably
valid
claim
and
that
that
was
for
decision
by
the
state
court.
and,
my
point
has
been
that
that
is
not
an
issue
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
stay.
the
rule
of
decision
on
the
merits,
federal
law
as
opposed
to
state
law,
obviously
state
law
is
strictly
involved.
and,
the
adequacy
of
the
state
action
to
protect
the
rights,
there
is
no
specific
indication
of
prejudice
here.
certainly
the
state
action
under
all
the
cases
is
adequate
to
protect
the
rights
and
that
matter
was
not
at
issue.
the
district
court's
findings
for
the
stay
were
that
in
fairness
to
the
parties
and
to
avoid
multiplicity
of
judicial
time
and
effort
and
piecemeal
litigation
the
stay
was
entered.
the
district
court
also
found
that
there
was
no
good
cause
shown
to
litigate
in
both
courts,
simply
saying,
as
in
all
these
cases,
that
there
were
no
countervailing
reasons
to
outweigh
proceeding,
adjudicating,
as
opposed
to
the
stay.
in
other
words,
that
there
were
no
countervailing
reasons
such
as
federal
question
involved
such
as
in
the
moses
cone
case
where
the
arbitration
act
demonstrated
a
federal
policy
that
guided
the
decision.
mr.
chief
justice,
with
your
permission,
i
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
ronald
glen
polly
i
wish
first
to
say
again
with
respect
to
the
piecemeal
litigation
issue
and
the
finding
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
lake
did
not
have
an
arguably
valid
claim
against
the
subcontractors,
and,
therefore,
there
was
no
piecemeal
litigation.
let
me
point
out
to
this
court
that
the
district
judge
in
this
case
found
that
piecemeal
litigation
exists.
not
only
did
the
court
of
appeals
find
that
it
did
not
exist
but
the
district
judge
found
that
it
did
exist
specifically
in
his
stay
order.
the
question
is
not
whether
the
court
of
appeals
made
that
finding
and
could
make
that
finding.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct.
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
the
district
judge
abused
his
discretion
in
finding
that
piecemeal
litigation
occurred.
and,
yes,
this
court
must
determine
whether
or
not
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
ruling
that
the
district
judge
abused
his
discretion
in
finding
that
piecemeal
litigation
exists.
the
district
judge,
it
must
be
realized,
impliedly
found
in
the
stay
request
that
lake
had
an
arguably
valid
claim
against
the
subcontractors
as
he
had--
mr.
ronald
glen
polly
--thank
you.
