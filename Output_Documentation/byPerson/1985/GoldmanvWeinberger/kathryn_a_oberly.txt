ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
lewin
only
grudgingly
acknowledges
that
this
is
a
military
case
and
not
a
civilian
free
exercise
case.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
yes.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
as
to
whether
the
yarmulke
is
required?
yes,
it's
our
position,
it
was
captain
goldman's
testimony
at
trial
also,
that
although
it
is
a
strong,
well-established
practice
and
tradition
of
devout
orthodox
jewish
males
to
wear
a
yarmulke,
it
is
not
a
requirement
of
jewish
law.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
i
don't
think
that
they
made
a
finding,
but
to
the
extent
that
he
did,
he
certainly
did
not
say
it
was
a
requirement
of
jewish
law,
and
there
is
a
definite
distinction
between
jewish
law
and--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--i
think
if
you
decide
it
on
captain
goldman's
own
testimony,
which
we...
at
page
6
of
our
brief
where
the
cite
is
to
page
200
of
the
joint
appendix,
petitioner
testified
that
a
custom
followed
by
some
but
not
all
devout
orthodox
jewish
males
is
the
wearing
of
a
yarmulke.
at
that
same
place
in
the
transcript
he
acknowledged
that
it
was
not
required
by
jewish
law.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
i'm
not--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--it
is
clearly
that
premise,
diminishes
the
level
of
the
significance
of
the
religious
practice
at
issue
here,
but
it
is
not
the
government's
position
that
there
is
no
religious
issue
at
all
involved,
that
it
has
to
rise
to
the
level
of
jewish
law
before
captain
goldman
can
claim
it
as
a
sincere
religious
practice
that
he
personally
follows.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
pardon?
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
his
interpretation
of
what
he
should
do
as
a
devout
orthodox
jew
is
wear
a
yarmulke,
and
we
are
willing
to
accept
that
as
a
sincere
religious
belief
on
his
part,
just
as
in
the
prior
case
we're
willing
to
accept
the
sincerity
of
the
religious--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--yes,
but
i
think
it's
not
at
all
irrelevant
for
the
court
to
take
cognizance
of
the
fact
that
captain
goldman
himself
acknowledges
that
it's
not
required
by
the
laws
of
his
religion
and
the
government
introduced
the
authorities
cited
in
the
footnote
4
to
show
that
jewish
rabbinical
authorities
agree
with
that.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
it
is,
and
that's
why
we
are
not
asking
the
court
to
say
this
is
not
a
religious
practice
entitled
to
consideration.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
that's
correct,
and
as
the
court
has
indicated,
in
some
cases
religions
of
one
are
sufficient.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
as
you
point
out
in
the
last
case,
your
honor,
religions
have
a
way
of
gaining
sudden
popularity
and
spreading
like
wildfire,
but
i'm
not
suggesting
that
yarmulkes--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--no,
but
the
incentives
to
seek
exemptions
from
the
uniform...
mandatory
uniform
requirements
are
quite
high.
they
may
approach
the
incentives
to
seek
exemptions
from
paying
taxes,
as
the
court
considered
in
the
united
states
versus
lee.
it's
only
human
nature
to
resent
being
told
what
to
wear,
when
to
wear
it,
what
to
eat,
when
to
get
up
and
how
to
spend
your
entire
day,
and
if--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--right.
you
are
not
in
proper
uniform,
justice
stevens,
and
it
would
not...
the
military
has
a
number
of
cases,
some
of
them
pending
in
litigation
that
are
cited
in
my
brief,
some
of
them
that
have
not
gotten
to
the
level
of
litigation
but
have
been
requests
for
religious
exemptions
and
that
number
is
constantly
growing.
and,
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
an
exemption
for
captain
goldman
is
constitutionally
required,
it's
only
common
sense
to
assume
that
the
number
of
requests
for
comparable
of
exemptions,
whether
from
orthodox
jews
wearing
yarmulkes
or
sikhs
wearing
turbans
or
rastafarians--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--the
air
force
does
not
have
sikh
cases.
the
army
has
a
number
of
sikh
cases.
the
first
one
they
received,
they
willingly
granted
that
first
sikh
and
exemption
to
wear
the...
and
then
sikhs
started
coming
out
of
the
woodwork,
just
as
you
predicted
in
the
last
case,
and
it
finally
reached
a
point
at
which
the
army
thought
they
were
getting
far
too
many
requests
for
exemptions.
they
could
not
accommodate
it.
they
couldn't
see
where
this
was
leading,
except
to
a
problem
of
unknown
dimensions,
and
they
then
cut
off
the
practice
of
accommodation.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
this
is
in
the
joint...
this
is
in
a
law
review
article
cited
in
our
brief
and
it's
also
in
the
joint
service
study
that
was
prepared
for
congress
which
is
a
public
document
prepared
after--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--that's
right.
that
is
correct,
in
any
branch
of
the
service,
in
any
military
department.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
who
wished
not
to
shave
their
beards?
that's
not
permitted
either.
the
only
exception
for
beards
is
temporary
treatment
of
a
medical
condition,
ingrown
facial
hairs,
and
that
lasts
about
90
days,
but
there's
no
religions
exception
for
beards.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
well,
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
but
you
can't
wear
the
rug
unless
it's
for
prosthetic
medical
reasons
to
cover
up
disfiguration
or
baldness
caused
by
illness.
i'm
not
sure
of
the
reason
for
that.
it
may
be
as--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--it
may
be,
as
mr.
lewin
suggested,
that
if
you
put
a
toupee
on
top
of
a
full
head
of
hair
it
will
not
look
like
a
uniform.
it
would
detract
from
the
neat,
professional
image
that
the
military
is
trying
to
promote.
but
in
fact,
toupees
are
not
a
solution
to
captain
goldman's
problem.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
unless
he's
bald.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
except
to
cover
up
baldness
caused
by
some
sort
of
illness
or
disfiguration.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
that's
true,
although--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--that's
true,
but
unfortunately
it
does
not
and
i
would
assume
mr.
lewin
would...
i
would
agree,
it
doesn't
help
captain
goldman
because
most
of
his
work
is
done
inside.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
pardon?
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
your
honor,
the
military's
position
is,
it
doesn't
matter
where
you
are,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
you
are
in
combat,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
you
are
serving
in
time
of
peace,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
you're
ashore,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
you're
on
training
exercises.
at
every
single
instant
of
your
military
career--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--that's
right.
the
only
way--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--pardon?
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
no,
you're
not.
but
at
the
time
that
you
may
have
served
in
the
military,
you
were.
and
the
military...
the
judgment
of
the
military
professionals
to
whom
we
look
to,
to
provide
us
with
answers
to
these
questions,
and
i
am
not
suggesting
that
the
court
should
just
abdicate
to
their
judgment,
but
when
their
judgment
is
based
on
rational
factors
as
we
think
it
is
in
this
case,
then
it
is
the
civilian
court's
role
to
accept
that
judgment.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
beards
are
not
permitted.
moustaches
that
do
not
extend
beyond
the
corners
of
the
mouth
are
permitted.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
i
think
he
is
part
of
the
department
of
health
and
human
services.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
he's
not
a
military
officer.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
the
public
health
service,
your
honor,
is
also
a
uniformed
service
but
they're
not
a
military
department.
the
public
health
service
is
part
of
the
department
of
health
and
human
services.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
that's
the
brown
case.
that
would
be...
i
find
all
of
the
tests
somewhat
unhelpful,
but
that
would
be
one
test
that
we
would
use.
another
way
of
rephrasing
the
same
test
would
be
to
say
that
the
government's
burden
is
to
show
a
substantial
governmental
interest,
which
is
not
necessarily
the
same
thing
as
a
compelling
governmental
interest
as
used
in
thomas,
and
to
show
that
the
means
chosen
to
achieve
that
substantial
governmental
interest
are
reasonably
related
to--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--i
must
say
that
although
the
"clear
danger"
words
appear
in
those
opinions,
that
is
not
in
fact
what
the
court
did.
what
the
court
did
was
sanction
the
prior
restraint
on
speech
and
petitions
to
congressmen,
saying
that
a
military
commander
need
not
await
the
actual
outbreak
of
disruption
and
a
threat
to
order,
discipline
and
loyalty
among
his
troops
before
he
can
act
to
avert
that
disruption.
that
is
inconsistent
with
saying
that
he
can
only
act
when
there's
a
clear
danger.
in
other
words,
by
authorizing
prior
restraints
on
speech
or
petitions
to
congressmen
or
leafletting,
the
court
clearly
wasn't
requiring
the
actual
occurrence
of
a
present
danger,
of
a
clear
danger.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
what
i'm
saying
is
that
i
think
that
our
position
here
is
fully
consistent
with
what
the
court
did
in
the
greer
and
brown
cases,
by
saying
that
military
changes
don't
have
to
wait
for
the
actual
occurrence
of
the
clear
danger,
and
that
here
in
this
case
what's
analogous
to
the
presumed
clear
danger
in
the
free
speech
cases
is
the
military
judgment
that
exceptions
to
the
uniform
requirement
will
undermine
the
military
purposes
of
training,
discipline,
morale,
esprit
de
corps,
things
that
the
military--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--yes,
your
honor.
the
court
has
said
in
brown
itself,
and
also
more
recently
in
chappell
versus
wallace,
that
the
military
does
not
need
to
have
and
in
effect
can't
practically
have
different
rules
for
combat
in
peacetime
and
ashore
and
on
base,
the
same
set
of
rules,
the
same
criminal
justice
system,
same
uniform
requirements
apply
at
all
stages
to
every
service
member.
the
reason
is
that
the
job
of
the
peacetime
military,
no
matter
where
they're
stationed,
no
matter
what
their
duty
assignment
is,
is
to
be
ready
to
fight
a
war,
to
defend
this
country
should
they
be
called
upon
to
do
so,
and
therefore
it's
essential
that
they
be
equally
well
trained
and
indoctrinated
from
the
moment
that
they
join
the
military
as
it
is--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--it
interferes
with...
it's
military
judgment
that...
let
me
back
up
a
minute.
we
are
not
saying
that
captain
goldman
alone
would
necessarily
be
a
threat
to
the
national
security
if
he
is
allowed
to
wear
his
yarmulke.
that
is
not
our
position.
our
position,
however,
is
that
deviations
as
a
class
from
the
uniform
requirement
interfere
with
the
military
purposes
i've
identified,
by
preventing
the
assimilation
of
an
incredibly
diverse
group
of
civilians
who
come
into
the
military
from
widely
varying
backgrounds,
who
do
not
come
in
with
the
notion
of
instinctive
obedience
to
command,
who
in
fact
come
in
with
perhaps
the
opposite
notion,
and
who
from
the
day
they
arrive
need
to
be
trained
and
inculcated
in
military
life.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
not
at
all.
however,
it
might
interfere
with
other
persons'
religious
beliefs.
i
mean,
once
it's
determined--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--no,
because
once
it's
determined
to
have
a
uniform
requirement--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--if
all
of
them
did,
it
would
be
part
of
the
air
force
uniform.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
it
could
interfere
with
safety,
but
it
would
not--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--well,
there's
certain...
safety
isn't
an
issue
in
this
case,
but
there
are
certain
situations
where
headgear
of
any
sort
could
interfere
with
safety,
such
as
a
hat
flying
into
a
jet
engine,
and
in
that
case
you
don't
wear
headgear.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
your
honor,
the
point
is
that
once
it's
determined
that
there
be
a
uniform
requirement
for
the
military--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--no,
you're
not
compelled
to
agree,
but
you
are
in
our
opinion
required
to
have
a
fairly
strong
reason
for
disagreeing
because--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--no.
the
first
amendment
clearly--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--the
first
amendment
clearly
gives
the
court
a
proper
role
in
reviewing
this.
however,
the
court
said
in
parker
versus
levy,
servicemen
don't
lose
their
first
amendment
rights
but
they're
applied
differently
in
the
military
because
of
the
unique
nature
of
military
society,
and
that's
all
that
we
are
telling
the
court
in
this
case.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
yes.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
i'll
take
them
separately.
crosses
could
not
be
worn
if
they
are
worn
outside
of
the
uniform
and
were
in
any
way
visible.
if
you
could
wear
rosary
beads
or
a
cross
or
whatever
under
your
uniform
and
it
wasn't
visible,
that
would
not
be
a
uniform
violation
and
it's
because
no
one
would
notice
the
visibility.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
that's
correct.
as
to
masonic
rings,
the
regulations
allow
the
wearing
of
neat
and
conservative
rings
which
could
or
could
not
have
religious
significance.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
that's
correct.
it
could
also
be
a
wedding
ring,
which
might
be
the
reason
for
allowing
rings
on
more
than
one
hand
so
you
can
have
your
west
point
ring
on
one
hand
and
your
wedding
ring
on
the
other
hand,
and
the
regulations
allow
the
wearing
of
one
inch
wide
identification
bracelets.
that's
the
extent
of
the,
quote,
"jewelry
exception".
no
attempt
is
made
in
the
regulation
to
tie
it
in
any
way,
one
way
or
the
other,
to
religion.
it's
your
choice
as
to
what
type
of
jewelry,
your
masonic
ring
or
something
else,
you
would
choose
to
exercise
within
that
option.
but,
it's
been
determined
that
that
minor
exception
does
not
interfere
with
the
military
purposes
of
inculcating
standardization
that
the
uniform
does.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
at
all
times
on
duty,
and
it
also
specifies
what
you
may
or
may
not
do
when
you're
off
duty.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
if
you're
not...
there
are
times
when
you're
authorized
to
be
around
the
base
but
not
in
your
uniform
and
in
that
case
captain
goldman
could
wear
his
yarmulke
because
it's
not
inconsistent
to
wear
other
articles
of
clothing.
i
mean,
you
choose
your
own
civilian
clothes
and
as
long
as
you're
dressed
at
a
time
when
it's
okay
to
be
in
civilian
clothes,
you
can
choose
your
civilian
clothes
including
the
yarmulke.
the
problem
is
that
with
the
uniform,
you
don't
wear
headgear
indoors
and
the
regulation
is
not
directed
against
yarmulkes.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
then
you
cannot
wear
the
yarmulke.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
indoors,
you
can't
wear
any
headgear
indoors
with
the
uniform.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
that's
correct,
because
the
uniform
regulation
specifies
what
is
the
uniform.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
if
you're
in
uniform
you
wear
only
what
is...
what
the
regulation
which
is
sort
of
like
a
catalogue,
it's
190
pages
long
with
pictures
that
tell
you
exactly
what
to
wear
on
every
occasion
and
tells
you
when
you
can
wear
it
and
what
combinations
of
uniform
articles
you
can
wear
with
other
uniform
articles
and
you
don't
add
to
or
detract
from
that,
but
if
you're
in
your
civilian
clothes
that's
an
entirely
different
situation.
your
uniform,
however,
whether
you're
on
or
off
duty,
has
certain
required
elements
and
you
can't
add
to
or
detract
from
those
elements
that
are
specified
in
the
regulations.
i'd
like
to
point
out,
as
mr.
lewin
mentioned
at
the
end,
that
we,
the
government
discussed
in
its
brief
at
some
length
a
study
that
was
done
by
the
defense
department
for
congress
on
the
whole
subject
of
whether
and
to
what
extent
the
military
services
could
accommodate
religious
practices.
mr.
lewin
seems
to
denigrate
the
study
as
something
that
the
military
offered
up
instead
of
more
rigorous
requirements
to
be
imposed
on
the
military.
in
fact,
the
house
had
passed
a
bill
that
would
have
required
as
a
one-year
experiment
that
yarmulkes
or
religious
headgear
be
permitted,
and
the
senate
did
not
pass
that
bill.
instead,
the
result
in
conference
committee
was
the
requirement
that
the
defense
department
do
this
study
addressing
yarmulkes
and
all
other
issues
of
religious
accommodation,
and
report
back
to
congress
at
the
end
of
the
study
with
recommendations
as
to
what
accommodations
were
feasible
and
what
accommodations
were
not
feasible.
the
study
group
reported
back
that
they
could
and
would,
and
they
in
fact
have
made
accommodations
to,
in
certain
instances
that
are
deemed
consistent
with
military
necessity,
so
that
taking
yarmulkes
for
example,
it
is
now
defense
department
policy
to
allow
the
wearing
of
religious
garb,
whether
it's
a
yarmulke
or
something
else,
in
personal
living
quarters
occupied
by
soldiers
but
not
in
offices
or
in
areas
where
military
business
is
being
conducted.
,
and
the
study
group
that
did
the
study
for
congress
determined
that
greater
accommodation
would
interfere
with
the
military
mission.
what's
significant
about
that
to
us
is
that
it
shows
the
political
process
and
the
congressional...
or
constitutionally
committed
congressional
oversight
of
the
military,
working
the
way
it's
supposed
to.
congress
now
has
the
defense
department's
report.
congress
knows
how
the
defense
department
has
implemented
it.
if
congress
thinks
that
further
accommodation
is
either
required
or
desirable
it
can
legislate
it.
if
it
turns
out
that
congress
makes
a
mistake
and
orders
the
military
to
make
changes
in
its
uniform
regulations
that
do
in
fact
cause
disruption,
it's
quite...
it's
not
easy
but
it's
possible
for
congress
to
correct
that
mistake.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
this
court
constitutionalizes
mandatory
exceptions
to
the
uniform
requirements,
it's
quite
a
different
matter
and
far
more
difficult
for
what
might
turn
out
to
be
a
mistake
in
judgment
about
the
effect
on
discipline
and
morale
to
be
corrected.
so,
our
position
is
that
what's
going
on
here
is
the
political
process
of
civilian...
of
legislative
and
executive
branch
control
over
the
military,
working
exactly
as
it's
supposed
to,
and
that
we
would
ask
the
court
to
leave
the
situation
where
it
is
and
leave
it
to
the
branches
that
are
constitutionally
in
charge
of
the
military
rather
than
to
intervene
precipitously
in
an
area
that
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized,
civilian
judges
simply
do
not
have
the
expertise
to
second-guess
the
military
judgments
that
we're
talking
about.
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
nothing
else.
