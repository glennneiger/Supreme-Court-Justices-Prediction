justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
lewin,
you
refer
to
sherbert
against
verner
and
thomas
versus
the
review
board.
but
those
were
cases
from
civil
life.
we've
never
applied
that
sort
of
balancing
test
where
the
military
has
been
involved,
have
we?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
military
has
also
said...
at
least
there
is
testimony...
that
any
departure
is
in
itself
a
defeat
of
the
military
objective
which
is
uniformity
of
dress.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
what
the
military
is
saying,
is
that
the
purpose
of
uniforms
is
to
make
everybody
look
alike.
they
don't
want
people
to
look
different,
and
to
detract
from
that
is
itself
a
departure
from
the
military
scheme.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
in
the
military
context
have
we
said,
as
you
intimate
we
have
said,
that
departures
are
not
enough?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
you
are
just
drawing
a
negative
inference
from
languages,
where
the
holdings
would
be
against
you.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
wouldn't
mean...
the
military
has
never
taken
that
sort
of
a
position.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
one
that
hung
down
over
your
uniform?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
hasn't
the
government
said
here
that
if
the
thing
isn't
visible,
if
it's
a
cross
that
you
just
wear
on
your
t-shirt
and
your
uniform
covers
it,
then
it's
okay?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
isn't
the
basis
for
the
government's
distinction,
as
i
understand
it.
the
basis
is
that
if
it's
invisible
it
doesn't
alter
your
outward
dress
and
that's
all
the
government
is
concerned
with,
is
your
outward
dress.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
distinction
is
based
on
the
appearance
of
uniformity,
which
may
make
very
rational
sense.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
the
military
it
may
well
be.
certainly
we've
never
said
no.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
court
didn't
say
the
thing
would
have
been
invalid
if
it
hadn't
followed
that.
