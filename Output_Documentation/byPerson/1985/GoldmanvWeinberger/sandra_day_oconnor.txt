mr.
lewin,
as
long
as
you
are
interrupted,
may
i
ask
whether
it
makes
any
difference
in
your
view
if
someone
enters
the
service
voluntarily,
if
the
person
entering
the
service
knows
and
understands
the
military
is
not
willing
to
grant
such
an
exception
for
dress?
justice
sandra

--ms.
oberly,
in
the
military
context
of
a
free
exercise
claim,
what
is
the
test
that
you
think
our
cases
indicate
should
be
employed?
is
it
the
language
taken
from
the
case
that
refers
to
whether
there
is
a
clear
danger
to
military
effectiveness?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
the
court
were
to
use
the
test
of
whether
it's
a
clear
danger
to
military
effectiveness
as
applied
to
the
wearing
of
the
yarmulke
indoors
in
the
manner
which
captain
goldman
did
for
four
years
without
objection,
what
is
the
danger
to
military
effectiveness
in
his
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
haven't
answered
my
question.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
every
instance
regardless
of
the
particular
duty
assignment
or
location
and
so
forth?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
all
right.
so,
how
does
the
wearing
of
the
yarmulke
by
captain
goldman
in
the
hospital
affect
this?
