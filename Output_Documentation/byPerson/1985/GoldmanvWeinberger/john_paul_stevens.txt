justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt?
what
is
the
difference
between
a
cross
around
the
neck
and
a
yarmulke?
why
is
one
permissible,
and
the
other
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
you
suggest
there
be
constitutional
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
this.
could
the
military
constitutionally
prohibit
a
person
from
wearing
a
cross
that
was
rather
plainly
visible
around
the
neck?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt,
because
i'm
still
not
quite
clear
on
your
answer
to
one
of
justice
brennan's
earlier
questions.
what
about
different
kinds
of
headgear
that
are
somewhat
more
obvious?
is
it
the
same
constitutional...
say,
a
turban
or--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--intrusive...
no,
doesn't
have
any
physical
impairment,
it's
just
intrusive
in
the
sense
that
it's
readily
noticed
that
it's
different
from
everyone
else.
is
that
the
test?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
i
take
it,
a
turban
would
have
the
same
constitutional
protection?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
is
it
another
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
only
thing
that
means
is,
it's
more
visible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
think
you
are
saying
visibility
doesn't
make
any
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
think
the
visibility
of
a
yarmulke
is
enough.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
and
i
don't
mean
to
be
facetious,
would
it
satisfy
his
religious
belief
to
wear
a
toupee?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
indeed.
it
seems
to
me,
ms.
oberly,
that
the
extent
that
his
view
is
unique,
then
actually
strengthens
the
government's
case.
i'm
surprised
you
rely
on
this,
because
it
makes
it
less
likely
there
would
be
large
numbers
of
people
who
wear
this
particular
headdress.
