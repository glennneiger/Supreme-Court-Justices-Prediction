mr.
lewin,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
lewin,
you
mentioned
enlisted
personnel.
was
the
petitioner
here
an
officer,
or
did
he
occupy
civilian
status,
or
was
he--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--i
thought
you
said
enlisted
personnel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
mr.
lewin,
you
pressed
the
point
several
times
that
the
constitution
follows
a
person
into
the
military,
but
not
just
the
way
it
does
for
all
civilians,
of
course.
lights
out
at
11:00
o'clock,
you
can't
tell
civilians
that.
rights
of
association
are
quite
limited
in
the
military,
are
they
not?
let
me
ask
you
another...
somewhere
i
read
that
there
is...
someone
had
tabulated
387
different
religious
sects
extant
in
the
state
of
california.
one
of
them,
according
to
this
comment,
forbade
the
contact
of
metal
on
the
body.
you
couldn't
have
metal
buttons
or
a
belt
buckle
that
was
made
out
of
metal.
it
had
to
be
something
else.
now,
does
that
religious
belief
have
the
same
protection
that
you
urge
for
your
client
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you're
approaching
it
from
what
i
see
as
the
other
end.
suppose
you
had
a
person
of
that
faith,
came
in
and
said,
no,
i
can't
have
brass
buttons.
i
want
plastic
buttons
or
buttons
made
out
of
natural
wood
or
something,
stone.
the
military
must
accommodate
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--it's
a
badge
the
chaplains'
wear...
is
furnished
by
the
military
service,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
to
distinguish
the
chaplain
from
somebody
in
the
artillery
or
some
other
branch,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
doesn't
in
the
courtrooms
in
london
where
they
are
required
to
wear
a
wig.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
ms.
oberly.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--yet,
it's
not
just
a
matter
of
private
choice,
it's
a
private
choice
of
alternatives
that
includes
a
long
tradition?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--the
military
forbids
wearing
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
ms.
oberly,
i
think
i
missed
some
of
the
exchange
about
beards.
would
you
repeat
that
again,
what
the
regulations
are
about
beards?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
the
surgeon
general
of
the
united
states?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he's
an
admiral.
he
wears
a
navy
uniform.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
lewin?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
would
be
if
we
decided
it
on
a
constitutional
ground.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
lewin,
you
have
suggested
that
when
this
court
acts,
that
we
approve...
not
frequently,
but
certainly
it's
not
infrequently,
that
we
pass
on
an
act
of
congress,
that
doesn't
mean
we
approve
what
they've
done.
the
wisdom
of
what
congress
does
is
none
of
our
business,
and
unless
a
constitutional
question
arises
none
of
these
questions
are
really
relevant.
i
question
that
congress
is
eagerly
waiting
to
see
what
we
are
going
to
do.
perhaps
one
or
two
of
them
are.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
