for
what
other
reason
does
he
wear
a
yarmulke?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
other
reason
does
the
captain
wear,
other
than
religious?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why...
you
can
wear
a
rug
but
you
can't
wear--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--but
you
couldn't
wear
a
yarmulke?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i've--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
of
course,
all
of
this
argument
about
appearance
in
the
military
doesn't
involve
this
because
you
don't
wear
the
yarmulke
outside?
most
of
the
military
work
is
done
outside.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
it
doesn't
involve
that
at
all,
does
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
do
you
have
to
have
such
rigid
discipline
indoors?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
does--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--we
are
required
to
accept
that
without
question?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i'm
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
aren't
admirals
and
generals
exempt
from--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
everybody
in
the
military
wore
a
yarmulke.
would
that
interfere
with
the
efficiency
of
the
army?
justice
thurgood
marshall
we're
talking
about
efficiency.
now,
you
said
it
would
interfere
with
the
efficiency.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
know,
i
was
careful
not
to
ask
you
if
just
one
man
did
it,
would
that...
i
knew
that
didn't.
if
all
of
them--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--it
wouldn't
interfere
with
the
efficiency?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
could
it
interfere
with
safety?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
think
you
would
go
out
into
combat
without
a
helmet
on,
and
i
also
assume
that
the
yarmulke
would
be
under
the
helmet,
along
with
his
head.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
only
thing
you
have
is
that
the
army
said
yes,
and
we
have
to
agree.
justice
thurgood
marshall
like
the
first
amendment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
it's
in
the
ballpark.
