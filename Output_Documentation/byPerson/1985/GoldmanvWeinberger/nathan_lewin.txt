mr.
nathan
lewin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
a
single
constitutional
question
under
the
first
amendment's
free
exercise
clause.
the
issue
is
whether
the
military
services
may
unconditionally
refuse
to
make
any
exception
or
accommodation
from
their
dress
codes
for
enlisted
personnel
whose
religious
convictions
require
them
to
wear
a
neat,
small,
conservative
article
of
clothing
that
does
not
interfere
with
the
execution
of
any
military
task
but
that
is
forbidden
by
the
existing
military
regulations
simply
because
it
is
not
provided
for
in
the
dress
code
and
is
different
from
the
uniform.
the
petitioner
is
an
individual
who
was
raised
as
an
orthodox
jew
and
has
during
his
entire
adult
life
followed
the
religious
obligation
incumbent
on
jewish
males
of
keeping
his
head
covered
at
all
times
during
waking
hours.
although
the
government
in
a
footnote
implies
that
there
is
some
doubt
as
to
the
obligatory
nature
of
this
religious
duty,
it
acknowledged
in
response
to
our
requests
for
admissions,
and
i
quote,
"that
it
is
a
well
established
religious
tradition
and
practice
among
adherents
to
orthodox
judaism
that
males
keep
their
heads
covered
at
all
times.
"
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
he
was
an
officer.
he
joined
under
a
program
under
which
he
became...
he
was
a
psychologist
in
the
air
force
under
a
program
where
he
was
trained
and
then
became
a
captain,
entered
into
the
air
force
to
serve
as
a
psychologist,
so
he
was
an
officer.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i'm
sorry.
i
meant
officers
as
well
as
other
personnel
in
the
military
services.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
it
really
makes
no
difference,
because
we
think
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
indicate
that...
sherbert
and
verner
and
thomas
and
review
board...
that
government
may
not
condition
benefits,
for
example,
such
as
unemployment
compensation
benefits,
on
an
unconstitutional
condition
such
as
deprivation
of
religious
rights.
the
same
thing,
we
submit,
holds
true
if
in
fact
somebody
enters
knowing
that
there
is
such
a
regulation.
of
course,
the
practical
impact,
quite
frankly,
justice
o'connor,
of
a
decision
by
this
court
saying
that
the
military
may
apply
such
a
regulation
constitutionally
would
be
that
it
would
in
the
future
bar
conscientious
believers,
who
would
feel
that
they
could
not
go
day
to
day
without
covering
their
heads,
from
joining
the
air
force.
we
think
that's
really
an
additional
factor
as
to
why
this
court
ought
not
to
permit
the
absolute
rule
that
the
military
services
are
arguing
for
in
this
case.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
your
honor.
that's
absolutely
true.
they
were
cases
from
civilian
life
and
the...
what
makes
this
case
certainly
more
difficult,
and
the
solicitor
general,
i
think,
concedes
in
his
brief
that
in
civilian
life
there
could
probably
be
no
constitutional
objection
to
the
wearing
of
a
yarmulke
even
in
courts
or
other
places
where
one
is
ordinarily
required
to
dress
in
a
certain
way.
military
life
is
different.
however,
this
court
has
said
time
and
again
that
the
protections
of
the
bill
of
rights
apply
in
the
military,
and
our
view,
quite
frankly,
is
that
in
this
case
the
military
has
gone
far
beyond
what
this
court
has
even
tolerated
in
those
situations
where,
for
example
in
the
parallel
area
of
speech,
the
court
has
upheld
military
regulations.
just
to
proceed
immediately
to
that
point,
justice
rehnquist,
brown
and
glines
is
a
case
which
the
solicitor
general
relies
on
very
heavily,
but
of
course
brown
and
glines
which
was,
i
think,
the
extreme
in
terms
of
speech
cases
where
the
court
sustained
a
system
of
prior
restraint
in
the
area
of
speech
as
applied
to
the
military,
was
a
case
in
which
a
regulation
said
that
material
could
be
prohibited
from
a
military
base
if
it
presented,
quote,
"a
clear
danger
to
the
loyalty,
discipline
or
morale
of
members
of
the
armed
forces,
or
material
interference
with
the
accomplishment
of
a
military
mission.
"
the
opinion,
justice
powell's
opinion
for
a
majority
of
the
court,
spoke
four
times
of
the
standard
of,
quote,
"clear
danger".
clear
danger,
not
simply
the
possibility
of
some
disruption,
not
the
fact
that
there
might
be
some
interference,
but
a
clear
danger
to
factors
such
as
morale
and
discipline.
this
case
doesn't
concern
a
regulation
in
which
the
military
services
are
saying
any
deviation
from
the
dress
code
that
in
the
view
of
a
commander
presents
a
clear
danger
to
morale,
discipline,
may
be
prohibited.
this
is
a
case
where
the
military
has
simply
said,
absolutely,
unequivocally,
we
will
permit
not
the
slightest
departure
whether
it
presents
a
danger
or
not,
from
the
dress
code.
mr.
nathan
lewin
it's
true.
it
is
some
departure
if
one
assumes
that
any
departure
is
a
clear
danger.
what
we
are
saying--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--agreed,
justice
rehnquist.
the
question
is
whether
a
departure
in
and
of
itself
suffices,
or
whether
the
fact
that
something
is
a
departure
suffices
to
overcome
the
religious
protection
that's
afforded
by
the
free
exercise
clause.
and,
our
position
is
precisely
that
just
as
this
court
has
said,
that
departures
are
not
enough,
merely
departures
or
disruptions
are
not
enough
in
the
area
of
speech,
departures
if
they
don't...
are
not
so
extreme
as
to
present
that
kind
of
a
danger,
cannot
be
sufficient
merely
because
the
military
says
so.
because,
if
one
relies
on
what
the
military
says,
then,
we
submit,
essentially
this
court
is
saying
what
it
has
rejected
time
and
again
which
is
that
by
entering
upon
military
service
someone
doffs
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
think
by
the
emphasis
on
clear
danger
or--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
statements
that
have
been
made
that
say
that
the
constitution
does
protect
individuals
in
the
military
service
would
itself
be
undermined
if
in
fact
the
military
could
simply
by
saying
so
and
expressing
its
expert
opinion
say
that
variations
undermine
morale.
it
would
mean
that
the
military...
a
commander
could
just
as
well
say
prayer
is
prohibited,
private
prayer,
because
that
would
undermine
morale,
because
people
should
only
obey
commanding
officers
and
not
pray.
it
would
mean
the
military--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--we're
fortunate
that
they
haven't.
i'm
quite
astounded,
justice
rehnquist,
that
they
have
taken
the
position
that
such
small
departures
as
a
yarmulke
on
the
top
of
one's
head
or
even
a
kum-kum
as
cited
in
the
brief
that
they
refer
to,
the
dot
that
a
hindu
might
wear,
very
small
departures
from
the
uniform,
or
for
that
matter,
the
appendix
to
the
government's
brief.
the
government
has
taken
various
liberties,
i
must
say,
with
the
record
in
this
case
and
just
put
before
this
court
a
host
of
material
which
they
did
not
see
fit
at
all
to
subject
to
cross
examination
and
trial
in
this
case.
one
of
the
extraordinary
things
is
a
letter
that
they
print
as
an
appendix
to
the
solicitor
general's
brief
about
what
they...
at
that
time
was
51
members
of
a
pentecostal
church.
i'm
told
now,
by
speaking
to
the
pastor
after
i
saw
a
copy
of
the
letter,
over
100
members
of
a
pentecostal
church,
who
were
court-martialed
or
discharged
from
the
army
because
they
refused
to
roll
up
their
sleeves,
as
a
matter
of
piety.
now,
it
seems
to
me
again,
your
honor,
that
although
it
is
true,
the
military
can
say
that
every
order
requires
obedience
irrespective
of
what
a
civilian
court
may
say,
or
what
civilian
personnel
might
say,
we
submit
that
that's
not
what
the
free
exercise
clause
is
about.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
submit,
mr.
chief
justice,
every
religious
belief
would
have
protection.
the
question
of
whether
it
would
present
a
danger
either
to
morale
or
to
the
military
mission
might
be
quite
different.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
the
burden
to
the
military
certainly
is
a
very
substantial
factor,
and
where
the--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--no,
i
think
very
possibly
in
that
case
the
military
would
not
have
to
accommodate,
because
it...
well,
the
difference
is
that
where
the
military
is
required
to
create
a
whole
new
uniform
for
somebody--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--or
different
buttons.
if
he's
able
to
provide
his
own
buttons,
maybe
that
should
be
a
permissible
means.
if
he's
asking
the
military
to
provide
buttons
for
him,
i
think
that
may
cast
a
burden
which
a
yarmulke
does
not.
one
of
the
things
about
the
religious
observance
in
this
case
is,
it
imposes
no
burden
upon
anyone.
it
is
a
small
head
covering
that
someone
wears.
judge
starr
in
dissenting
below
noted
that
it
is
equivalent
to
prayer.
that's
really
all
that
it
is.
it's
a
constant
symbol
of
devotion
that
somebody
is
wearing
that
imposes
no
burden
on
any
other
person
whatever.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
justice
brennan.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
sikhs
require
the
wearing
of
turbans.
and
of
course,
the--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--well,
the
interesting
thing
is,
and
here's
where
i
say
the
government
takes
quite
a
liberty
with
the
record,
we
went
into
this
at
trial.
there
was
a
full
trial
in
this
case.
the
air
force
had
its
experts
on
the
stand.
we
went
into
whether
there
were
members
of
the
military
service
who
presented
these
dress
regulations.
the
witness
testified
that
he
had
heard
of
one
sikh
in
some
case
that
he
thought
involved
the
army.
now,
in
this
court,
suddenly,
with
representation
simply
made
in
the
brief,
we
are
told
by
the
army
that
there
are
so
and
so
many,
no
record,
no
opportunity
to
go
through
individual
circumstances,
and
we
submit
that
in
fact--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--nothing,
again.
a
chaplain
testified,
and
the
problem
is
of
course
this
country--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--none
that
i
know
of
in
the
air
force.
i
think
they
said
there
were
none.
mr.
nathan
lewin
again,
i
think
the
testimony
was,
there
were
none
that
they
knew
of
in
the
air
force.
and
the
point,
your
honor--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--yes,
your
honor.
i
think
distinctions
are
possible
under
a
standard
that
says
that
where
there
would
be
a
clear
danger
in
terms
of
morale
or
discipline,
it
seems
to
me
it's
possible.
the
solicitor
general
keeps
talking
about
how
the
standard
can't
be
expressed,
and
yet
the
air
force
dress
code
is
full,
is
just
chock
full
of
references
to
rings
or
bracelets
being
neat
and
conservative,
being
small;
small,
plain
healing
posts
with
regard
to
earrings,
identification
bracelets
that
are--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--that's
right.
it
does
not
prohibit
wearing
not
more...
there's
a
maximum
number,
not
more
than
three
rings.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
if
they're
obvious,
if
they're
open,
very
large,
then
i
think
it
might
very
well
fall
into
the
area
of
prohibited
ornamentation,
but
bracelets
are
permitted,
identification
bracelets
if
they're
neat
and
conservative.
where
such
a
small
and
neat--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--well,
i
don't
know
whether...
in
other
words--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--no,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
there
be
a
constitutional
difference.
i'm
just
saying...
i'm
saying
the
air
force
code
now
does
it.
if
there
were...
i
think--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--if
it's
a
matter
of
religious
obligation,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
military,
unless
it
could
find
that
it
in
some
way
interferes
with
the
morale
or
discipline,
could
not.
a
very
plain,
conservative
cross
that
is
religiously
required,
or
an
emblem
that
somebody
believes
is
religiously
mandated,
at
all
times,
i
think
that's--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--well,
the
question
is
what
the
religion
requires,
your
honor.
if
it
requires
that
it
hang
down
outside,
that's
one
thing.
if
it
simply...
if
it
requires
only
that
it
be
worn
underneath
garments,
the
military
can
say
that
anything
that
you
can
religiously
require,
anything
that
may
under
your
religion
be
worn
under
your
garments,
should
be
worn
under
your
garments.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
but
what
that
does
is,
it
distinguishes
in
terms
of
faiths
between
those
where
there
may
be
a
requirement
that
it
be
worn...
that
the
particular
article
has
to
necessarily
be
seen.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
let
me
say
that
first
of
all,
until
the
trial
in
this
case,
that
wasn't
true
either.
at
the
trial
in
this
case
it
developed
that
there
were
mormom
undergarments
that
were
being
worn
in
violation
then
of
the
regulations.
now
they
amended
the
regulations
to
permit
non-visible
objects
to
be
worn.
at
that
point,
even
that
was
not
permitted.
but,
even
that
distinction,
your
honor,
distinguishes
between
perfectly
conservative,
neat
looking
articles
of
apparel
that
may
be
worn
under
the
garments
and
those
that
may
be
neat,
and
worn
over--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--which
is
an
interest.
it's
a
rational
interest,
but
a
rational
interest,
justice
rehnquist,
is
not
enough
to
overcome
the
first
amendment.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
think
what
this
court
has
said
is
that
even
in
the
military,
that
one
has
to
apply
the
least
restrictive
alternative.
in
brown
and
glines
the
opinion
said,
"like
the
army
regulation
that
we
upheld
in
spock,
the
air
force
regulations
restrict
speech
no
more
than
is
reasonably
necessary
to
protect
the
substantial
government
interest.
"
so,
again
one
has
to
look
to
the
least
restrictive
alternative.
mr.
nathan
lewin
it's
true,
but
there
was
all
that
language
that
indicated
that
that
was
an
important
element
of
the
court's
result
that
it
reached
in
brown
and
glines,
that
it--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--military
chaplains,
yes.
yes,
they
do.
mr.
nathan
lewin
an
exception,
that's
permitted
under
the
regulations.
mr.
nathan
lewin
permit
that,
yes,
and
they
permit
the
wearing
of
other
religious
headgear,
yarmulkes,
other
things,
during
religious
services.
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
is,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
one
suggestion--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--yes,
and
the
military
services
certainly
would
be
free
if
they
said,
look,
there
are
persons
who
want
to
wear
skullcaps,
to
provide
uniform
skullcaps
for
religious
reasons.
there
will
be
no
objection.
there
is
no
requirement
on
the
part
of
captain
goldman
that
he
wear
only
his
own
yarmulke
that
he
has
worn
at
different
times,
but
that
he
can
wear
an
army...
an
air
force
issue
yarmulke
which
is
in
an
air
force
color
and
melds
with
the
uniform.
the
point
is
that
the
air
force...
and
the
reason
that
this
case
is
different,
justice
rehnquist,
is
that
the
air
force
and
the
military
are
providing
no
accommodation.
it's
not
as
if
they
are
saying,
we're
providing
some
recognition
of
the
religious
right
with
regard
to
dress
code,
but
we
will
not
accept
something
that
goes
so
far
as
saffron
robes.
we
heard
a
lot
at
the
trial
about
saffron
robes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
there
is
a
point,
justice
stevens,
i
think
where
a
headgear
or
a
head
covering
could
become
so
obtrusive
that
it
interferes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
no.
i
think
that
"readily
noticed"...
obviously
a
yarmulke
is
noticed.
mr.
nathan
lewin
so,
noticed
is
not
the
test.
i
think
the
question
is--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--it
would
be
another
case.
i
think
it
should.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
because
it
is
larger.
if
one
talks
about--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
justice
stevens,
to
the
extent
that
the
military
thinks
that
extraordinary
visibility
does--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--well,
and
what
we
are
saying
is
that
when
it
is
that
slight,
then
it
can't
really...
if
there
can't
be
sufficient
to
overcome
the
constitutional--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--i
understand.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
would
say
that
if
there
is
a
solid
religious
basis
for
it,
i
think
the
military
would
have
to
indicate
that
it
does
interfere.
i
think,
at
the
very
least,
justice
white,
i
am
saying
in
those
circumstances
the
military
has
got
a
burden
to
say,
yes,
we
think
this
interferes
in
such
an
obvious
way
with
military
discipline
that
it
is
prohibited.
on
the
other
hand,
when--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
i
think,
frankly,
justice
white,
if
an
article
of
clothing
is
so
obvious
and
so
extreme
that
when
one
looks
at
it
one
sees
only
it
and
doesn't
see
the
uniform,
i
think
the
military
could
make
a
determination,
a
reasoned
determination
that
that's
going
beyond
what
is
permissible.
that's
simply
not
true
of
very
small
items
such
as
a
yarmulke.
when
someone
wears
a
yarmulke,
one
barely
notices
it.
the
truth
is,
if
one
looks
closely
one
sees
it,
but
it
is
not
as
a
derby
or
a
top
hat
or
a
saffron
robe.
it
doesn't
totally
take
over.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
would,
and
in
fact
there
has
been
one
case
where
in
the
interim,
at
least,
while
matters
are
being
litigated,
that
a
toupee
was
worn
by
an
orthodox
jew
in
place
of
a
head
covering.
yes,
it
would
satisfy
it.
now,
our...
the
question
of
drawing
lines
between
what
it
neat
and
what
is
conservative
is
a
line
which
the
military
itself
draws.
our
point,
justice
white,
is
the
military
says
an
identification
bracelet
that's
neat
and
conservative
may
be
worn.
an
identification
bracelet,
presumably
that's
garish,
may
not
be
worn.
a
head
covering--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--i
don't
know.
i
don't
know.
but
rings
are
permitted,
but
again
they
must
be
neat
and
conservative.
why
can't
that
be
applied
to
headgear?
mr.
nathan
lewin
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
understand
that.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
they
know
what
religion
he
is.
a
yarmulke
is,
i
think
in
our
common
society
today,
has
come
to
be
known
as
a
sign
of
someone--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--no.
they
could
wear
a
toupee,
but--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--well,
because
he's
not
bald,
and
i
think
wearing
a
toupee
would
look--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--i
understand,
but
since
his
religion...
and
i
think,
by
the
way,
i
think
toupees,
the
regulations
permit
the
wearing
of
toupees
to
cover
baldness
or
disfigurement.
they
don't
specifically
permit
the
wearing
of
toupees
simply
to
keep
one's
head
covered.
but
that,
we
submit,
is
simply
a
way
of
avoiding
really
what
is
the
basic
question,
which
is,
should
someone
be
able
to
wear
something
that's
neat,
conservative,
not
obtrusive,
but
a
minor
variation
from--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--it's
a
recognizable
deviation.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
submit,
justice
white,
that
on
someone
who
has
a
full
head
of
hair,
wearing
a
toupee
would
look
somewhat
strange.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
true,
but
i
submit
that
if
the
military
saw
someone
walking
around
with
a
long,
white
wig,
they
may
not
be
willing
to
accept
that
as
part
of
the
dress
code.
mr.
nathan
lewin
even
in
the
judge
advocate.
in
our
view
this
case
really
presents,
although
it
seems
to
be
a
small
constitutional
issue,
a
very
fundamental
question
regarding
the
quality
of
the
military
service.
the
military
forces
are
the
protectors
of
our
liberty.
we're
proud
of
them.
we
want
them
to
be
proud
of
the
ideals
for
which
they
are
expected,
if
necessary,
to
lay
down
their
lives.
douglas
macarthur
said
that
men
will
not
fight
and
die
without
knowing
what
they
are
fighting
and
dying
for,
and
in
this
nation
they
fight
and
die
for
freedom
of
speech
and
conscience,
for
tolerance
and
diversity,
for
acceptance
of
all
creeds
and
peaceful
ways
of
life.
and
the
question
is
whether
the
message
that
one
carries,
that
the
military
carries,
is
that
conformity
overcomes
even
very
minor
deviations,
and
we
submit
that,
if
i
can
use
a
historical
parallel,
this
court
in
the
early
pre-war
or
world
war
ii
periods,
i
think
viewed
the
error,
really,
of
forcing
conformity
on
individuals
in
the
flag
salute
cases,
where
again
the
need
for
conformity
was
viewed
as
overriding
everything
else,
and
even
the
individual
rights
of
those
who
would
not
salute
the
flag,
and
that
error
finally
was
recognized
four
years
later.
and
we
submit
that
very
similarly,
we
have
here
where
chief
justice
stone
dissenting
in
gebitis
noted
that
in
that
case,
that
involved
a
small
minority
entertaining
in
good
faith
their
religious
belief,
and
that
small
and
helpless
minority
should
not
have
been
overridden
in
the
interests
of
conformity.
we
submit
that
with
regard
to
the
military
needs
here,
the
same
is
true.
the
military
can
carry
out
its
military
mission
and
can
carry
out
all
the
needs
of
morale
and
discipline
if
they
take
account
of
the
free
exercise
clause
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
government,
i
think,
acknowledged
in
its
request
for
admissions
that
it
was,
that
it
is
part
of
the
traditions.
it
is,
i
think
jewish
scholars
recognize
in
terms
of
the
degrees
of
requirement,
it
is
not
among
the
biblical
commandments,
certainly.
however,
rabbinic
view,
the
weight
of
rabbinic
view
is
that
it
should
be
worn
at
all
times
during
waking
hours.
there's
an
authority
that
the
government
cites
in
a
footnote
of
someone
who
says
that
if
his
livelihood
is
dependent
on
it,
one
may
remove
the
yarmulke.
but,
that
was
not
captain
goldman's
view.
that
was
not
the
view
of
the
rabbis
he
followed
and
from
whom
he
requested
opinions,
and
it
is
not
the
view
that
the
government
acknowledged
in
the
district
court.
and
again,
i
say
if
this
court
looks
at
the
record
in
the
district
court,
not
at
a
study
that
was
made
subsequently
to
justify
the
government's
position,
the
study
which
is--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--no,
i
don't
agree
with
that.
and
let
me
say
that...
again,
i
was
saying
that
this
joint
service
study
that's
quoted
by
the
government
repeatedly,
we've
talked
about
that
in
the
yellow
brief,
our
reply
brief
on
the
cert
petition,
that
was
a
study
that
was
made
when
the
military
had
the
choice
of
congressional
legislation
that
would
have
permitted
yarmulkes
and
then
went
to
the
congress
and
said,
well,
we'll
study
this.
it
was...
justice
stevens,
i
think,
spoke
in
an
opinion
a
few
terms
ago
about
the
dangers
of
looking
to
what
parties
do
in
the
course
of
litigation
when
they
want
to
improve
their
positions
in
litigation.
that's
exactly
what
this
joint
service
study
was.
it
was
foreordained
because
it
was
done
to
demonstrate
to
the
congress
that
they
could
not
allow
departures
from
uniform
in
the
military.
mr.
nathan
lewin
if
i
might
just
take
a
minute,
your
honor,
on
ms.
oberly's
last
point,
the
fact
is,
of
course,
that
congress
will
be
affected
by
whatever
this
court
says
regarding
this
case.
at
the
time
the
study
was--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--yes,
and
if
this
court
says
there's
no
constitutional
right,
at
the
time
this
was
being
discussed
in
the
halls
of
congress,
military
personnel
went
down
to
see
senator
hatch
and
we
have
reproduced
some
of
that
material
in
that
reply
brief,
the
question
was,
is
there
a
constitutional
right.
senator
hatch
said,
although
he
supported
the
study,
that
he
hoped
this
court
would
reverse
this
case,
and
that's
in
the
congressional
record.
so
that,
the
congress
is
looking...
various
congressmen,
even
if
they
supported
the
study,
were
looking
at
this
court's
action
with
regard
to
that.
so,
simply
to
say
that
if
this
court
affirms
what
the
court
below
did,
then
everything
is
being
put
in
a
neutral
position,
is
totally
unrealistic.
congress
will
take
that
as
an
approval
of
what
the
military
has
done,
and
of
its
report,
even
though
that
report
was
done
precisely
in
terms...
in
the
context
of
this
piece
of
litigation.
finally,
let
me
say
that
obviously
the
most
difficult
part
of
this
case
is
drawing
the
line,
but
drawing
lines
is
what
this
court
has
done
time
and
again
in
various
other
constitutional
areas.
it
does
it
in
the
speech
area
with
regard
to
clear
and
present
danger.
it
does
it
in
the
speech
area
and
in
the
press
area
with
regard
to
obscenity
and
pornography
cases.
difficult
lines
had
to
be
drawn,
but
to
say
that
because
there's
a
difficulty
of
drawing
the
line,
someone
who
is
going
to
be
wearing
and
is
required
by
a
matter
of
conscientious
conviction
to
be
wearing
an
article
of
clothing
that
is
neat,
that
is
demonstrated
by
actual
experience,
which
is
captain
goldman's
actual
experience
over
close
to
four
years,
and
the
actual
experience
of
the
other
doctor
who
testified
in
this
record,
to
say
that
that
is
something
that
would
interfere
with
military
discipline,
we
think
is
just
plainly
contrary
to
fact
and--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--well,
i'm
afraid,
from
my
experience
with
congress,
they
certainly
focus
very
much
on
what
this
court
says.
