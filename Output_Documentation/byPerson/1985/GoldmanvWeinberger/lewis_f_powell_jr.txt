mr.
lewin,
there
seems
to
be
some
disagreement
in
the
briefs
as
to
whether
the
wearing
of
the
yarmulke
is
required
by
jewish
law.
what
is
the
correct
situation?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
footnote
4,
i
believe,
on
page
6
states
that
although
the
wearing
is
a
revered
tradition,
it
is
not
required
by
jewish
law.
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
interrupt
you?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
are
you
still
adhering
to
footnote
4?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
was
that
the
finding
of
the
district
court?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
what...
on
what
premise
should
we
decide
this
case?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
i
gather
you
are
saying,
if--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--if
we
have
to
proceed
on
that
premise
we
don't
have
to
reach
the
constitutional
issue?
