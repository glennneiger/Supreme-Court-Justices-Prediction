mr.
farber,
perhaps
i
have
been
around
too
long,
but
years
and
years
ago,
wasn't
there
another
federal
earned
income
credit
in
the
code,
perhaps
the
'39
code,
by
which
one
obtained
a
deduction
for
earned
income
as
contrasted
with
unearned
income
such
as
dividends,
interest,
capital
gains?

think
i
have
been
around
too
long,
but
i
am
sure
there
was
one
back
in
the
thirties
and
forties.
