justice
john
paul
stevens
--let
me
just
be
clear.
the
money,
though,
if
it
is
withheld
and
recouped,
it
doesn't
go
to
the
parents
of...
the
first
family;
rather,
it
goes
to
the
state,
doesn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
just
let
me
ask
this
one
further
question
about
the
language?
of
course,
it
is
troubling
because
it
says
payable
as
refunds
of
federal
taxes
paid,
and
i
guess
your
opponent's
argument
is
that
the
manner
of
payment
of
the
earned
income
credit
is
as
a
refund
of
a
federal
tax
paid,
and
therefore
that
it
fits
right
into
the
language.
now,
how
do
you
deal
with
the
problem
of
the
literal
language?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
your
point
about
purpose
and
so
forth.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
take
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--are
you
saying
in
effect,
then,
that
the
common
clause,
or
whether
it
is
a
phrase,
"as
refunds
federal
taxes
paid"
modifies
amounts,
"which
precedes
it"--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--rather
than
the
word
"payable",
which
follows
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
it
did
modify
payable,
then
you
would
have
a
much
more
difficult
case,
an
ambiguity.
that
is
correct.
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
you
are
saying
it
is
really
a
qualification
of
the
substantive
amount
rather
than
a
description
of
the
procedure
of
payment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
help
me
a
little,
because
i
want
to
coordinate.
section
6401(b)
was
enacted
when?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
this
is
long...
how
could
the
reference
to
earned
income
credits
be
in
the
'54
code.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
really
am
asking
a
very
elementary
question.
section
6401(b)
in
the
form
in
which
it
appears
in
the
appendix
to
your
brief
was
enacted
when?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
was
done
in
'75,
before
there
was
any
intercept
program.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
this
set
up
the
procedure
by
which
the
earned
income
credit
would
be
paid
to
the
person
who
needed
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
happened
in
the
case
for
a
person
who
was
entitled
to
an
earned
income
credit
but
didn't
earn
enough
money
to
file
a
tax
return?
how
did
he
get
it,
if
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
were
the
requirements
for
being
eligible
for
earned
income
credit?
i
am
still
a
little
unclear
about
this?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
just
one
other
question
to
get
the
sequence
in
order,
if
i
may.
the
next
statutory
enactment
of
significance
is
the
1981
enactment,
and
that
is
fully
before
us
in
this
typewritten
thing.
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
that
text
itself
doesn't
refer
to
the
earned
income
credit.
i
mean,
i
understand
you
think
it
does
by
picking
up
through
the
word
"payment".
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
in
1981
that
indicates
one
way
or
another
whether
congress
even
mentioned
earned
income
credit--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
farber,
you
have
in
your
brief
some
indication
of
the
amounts
of
money
involved.
to
what
extent
has
the
irs
done
this?
did
they
exercise
the
power
you
now
describe
by
collecting
from
earned
income
credit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
has
it
been
used
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
a
moment
ago
you
said
they
hadn't
even
mentioned
the
earned
income
credit
at
the
time
of
the
1981--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
am
asking
you
about
use
of
this
power
as
a
means
of
collecting
from
earned
income
credits.
you
say
that
has
been
done
thousands
of
times.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
it
is
not
in
the
record,
but
you
do
go
outside
the
record
from
time
to
time.
i
am
asking
you
if
that
power
was
ever
used
to
levy
unearned--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yet
you
rely
heavily
on
the
fact
that
that
power
was
there
for
several
years.
justice
john
paul
stevens
unless
it
thought
there
was
a
federal
interest
in
having
the
earned
income
credit
go
to
the
people
who
had
these
dependent
children
who
needed
money.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
i
am
suggesting
is,
it
didn't
really
need
to,
because
the
practice
was
so
clear
that
they
never
even
tried
to
invoke
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
have
acknowledged
that
to
the
best
of
your
knowledge
they
never
tried
to
invoke
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
farber,
you
keep
relying
on
an
authorization
that
they
never
used
for
six
years.
i
don't
find
that
at
all
persuasive,
in
all
candor,
but
let
me
just
ask
you
this.
does
it
really
make
any
sense
for
the
federal
government
to
appropriate
to
subsidize
a
certain
category
of
our
society
and
say,
you
need
some
money,
and
then
say,
yes,
but
we
want
to
intercept
that
and
give
it
to
the
states?
that
is
what
is
happening.
justice
john
paul
stevens
clearly
here
if
you
are
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
it
true
that
this
is
subsidy
for
a
group
of
needy
people
that
the
federal
government
is
financing,
and
if
it
is
diverted,
it
goes
to
the
states
to
pay
off
some
debts
by
the
same
group
of
people.
and
does
it
seem
likely
the
federal
government
intended
to
subsidize
the
state's
collection
of
obligations
of
this
kind?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
past
it
has
collected
them
out
of
the
assets
of
the
people
who
owe
the
money,
their
own
tax
money.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
to
the
extent
that
you
are
successful
here
the
honoring
of
the
support
will
be
financed
by
the
federal
government.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
that
true?
the
earned
income
credit
money
all
comes
out
of
the
federal
treasury?
and
you
are
saying
that
money
should
be
devoted
to
pay
off
this
man's
past
due
debts.
justice
john
paul
stevens
except
that
here
the
benefit
title
really
was
intended
for
the
children
rather
than
for
the
man,
as
in
the
case
of
the
unemployment
compensation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
can't
get
it
if
he
doesn't
have
children.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
is
the
section
that
requires
the
reduction?
