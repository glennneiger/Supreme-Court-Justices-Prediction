what
group
of
children
do
you
say
was
in
that
latter
category?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
problem
is
that
the
secretary
wants
to
take
that
credit
and
withhold
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
the
benefit
of
some
other
group
of
children?
justice
byron

white
to
make
the
applicant
pay
his
debts.
justice

i
see--
justice
byron
r.
white
where
do
these
withholdings
go
today?
suppose
we
agree
with
the
government,
and
they
withhold.
they
recapture.
they
intercept.
where
does
that
money
go
that
they
intercept?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
would
it
redound
to
the
benefit
of
the
former
parent
or
the--
justice
byron

--i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
was
not
included
in
the
sheet
that
was
handed
out?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
have
to
concede
that
there
is
somewhat
of
an
ambiguity
in
that
provision
of
the
social
security
act
as
to
what
that
phrase
modifies
as
payable,
what
payable
applies
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
well,
now,
let's
assume
we
don't
agree
with
you
as
to
how
464
should
be
read.
then
there
is
a
conflict
between
the
two
sections.
and
how
do
we
resolve
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
that
expressly
defines
as
overpayments...
that
provision
was
passed
in
'75.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
wasn't
changed
at
all
in
'80.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
may
be
you
should
ignore
it.
congress
just
didn't
even
think
of
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we
would
just
be
saying
that
we
will
construe
the
internal
revenue
code
in
the
light
of
the
social
security--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
incentive
is
somewhat
removed
by
this
intercept.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
one
of
the
purposes
is
to
get
people
to
pay
their
obligations
in
the
future,
it
certainly
isn't
very...
this
intercept
program
certainly
isn't
very
effective.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
one
of
the
purposes
to
urge
these
debtors
to
pay
their
debts
in
the
future
as
they
accrue?
