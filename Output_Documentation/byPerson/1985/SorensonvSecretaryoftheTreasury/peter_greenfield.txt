mr.
peter
greenfield
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
in
this
case
the
court
is
asked
to
construe
section
2331
of
the
omnibus
budget
reconciliation
act
of
1981,
or
obra.
in
obra,
congress
established
the
tax
intercept
program
for
collecting
child
support
owed
to
state
welfare
agencies,
and
it
directed
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
intercept
"refunds
of
federal
taxes
paid"
payable
to
certain
individuals.
what
this
court
is
asked
to
decide
is
whether
congress
authorized
the
interception
of
earned
income
credit
benefits
when
it
directed
the
interception
of
refunds
of
federal
taxes
paid.
it
is
petitioner's
contention
that
it
did
not
authorize
interception
of
earned
income
credit
benefits,
and
that
was
also
the
holding
of
the
second
circuit
in
nelson
versus
regan
and
the
tenth
circuit
in
bucker
versus
the
secretary
of
the
treasury.
we
are
here
because
the
ninth
circuit
ruled
the
other
way.
there
are
three
points
that
i
would
like
to
emphasize
this
morning.
the
first
is
that
the
statutory
phrase
"refunds
of
federal
taxes
paid"
is
a
distinctive
and
unambiguous
phrase
which
literally
does
not
encompass
earned
income
credit
benefits.
the
second
is
that
the
structure
of
section
2331
of
obra
is
inconsistent
with
the
broad
reading
the
secretary
has
given
to
section
6402(c)
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
and
the
third
and
perhaps
most
important
point
is
that
when
congress
enacted
section
2331,
it
was
concerned
with
support
for
children
and
with
reducing
the
cost
of
the
afpc
program,
and
it
would
have
made
no
sense
in
that
context
to
fund
support
for
one
group
of
needy
children
aided
under
the
afdc
program
by
taking
benefits
from
another
group
of
children,
perhaps
as
needy
or
more
needy
who
because
their
parents
were
working
were
assisted
under
the
earned
income
credit
benefit
program.
to
start
with
the
phrase
"refunds
of
federal
taxes
paid"--
mr.
peter
greenfield
--children,
justice
white...
in
order
to
qualify
for
an
earned
income
credit
benefit,
an
applicant
must
reside
with
a
dependent
child,
and
the
benefit
only
goes
to
low
income
families,
so
the
children
i
am
speaking
about
are
children
in
families
eligible
for
earned
income
credit
benefits.
mr.
peter
greenfield
that's
correct.
mr.
peter
greenfield
to
help--
mr.
peter
greenfield
--to
reduce
the
cost
of
the
afdc
program.
as
adopted
in
1981,
this
would
reflect
an
attempt
to
recoup
the
costs
of
support
for
needy
children
already
paid.
mr.
peter
greenfield
the
expression
"refund"--
mr.
peter
greenfield
--that
was
the
only
place
that
it
could
go
in
1984.
perhaps
the
most
important
of
these,
referred
to
in
the
government's
brief,
is
in
the
deficit
reduction
act
of
1984,
which
adopts
a
parallel
intercept
program
using
virtually
the
same
language
to
collect
any
debt
owed
to
the
federal
government
with
a
limited
exception.
i
think
it
is
social
security
overpayments.
mr.
peter
greenfield
there
are
several
different
places
it
could
go
today.
one
is
to
a
state
that
is
paid
welfare
benefits.
another
is
to
the
federal
government
to
recoup
a
student
loan
or
debts
of
the
small
business
administration.
there
is
a
limited
circumstance
in
which
a
child
support
debt
owed
to
an
individual
but
assigned
to
a
state
could
also
be
collected
based
on
the
child
support
enforcement
amendments
of
1984.
that
was
not
the
case
in
1981.
mr.
peter
greenfield
in
the
limited
situation
in
which
a
state
was
collecting
for
a
non-welfare
family,
that
could
be
the
case,
justice
white.
mr.
peter
greenfield
but
that
would
be
a
situation
in
which
presumably,
since
that
child
would
not
be
on
welfare,
it
would
be
taking
funds
from
a
needy
child
in
an
earned
income
credit
benefit
family
to
support
a
child
that
was
less
needy.
now,
the
phrase
"refunds
of
federal
taxes
paid"
appears
nowhere
in
the
internal
revenue
code.
so
far
as
we
are
aware,
it
was
used
for
the
first
time
in
a
federal
statute
in
section
2331.
the
term
"refund",
of
course,
is
used
frequently,
and
it
is
a
term
that
is
used
to
refer
to
any
payment
made
through
the
tax
refund
process.
all
such
refunds,
payments
made
through
that
process,
correspond
to
federal
taxes
actually
paid
with
one
exception,
and
that
exception
is
the
earned
income
credit
benefit.
one
need
not
have
owed
any
tax
or
paid
any
tax
in
order
to
be
eligible
for
this
cash
payment,
and
as
the
government
concedes,
earned
income
credit
benefits
do
not
correspond
to
taxes
actually
paid.
mr.
peter
greenfield
yes,
it
does.
mr.
peter
greenfield
let
me
address
the
relationship
between
section
6402(c)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
and
section
464
of
the
social
security
act,
which
is
our
response
to
this
argument
made
by
the
secretary.
and
to
help
do
that,
i
have
asked
the
clerk
to
distribute
to
you
on
the
eight-and-a-half-by-fourteen
page
the
full
text
of
section
2331
in
which
both
of
these
provisions
originated.
now,
you
will
notice
that
in
subsection
(a)
of
2331
congress
established
the
tax
intercept
program.
we
contend
that
this
is
really
the
basic
text
of
the
program,
and
it
is
an
unambiguously
limited
authorization.
that
is,
it
only
applies
to
refunds
of
federal
taxes
paid.
in
subsection
(b)
of
2331,
congress
imposed
an
obligation
on
states
to
participate
in
the
tax
intercept
program.
now,
having
done
that
much,
the
program
was
in
place,
and
i
have
been
asked
before
in
this
case
why
was
it
necessary
to
go
and
add
subsection
(c).
the
reason
it
was
necessary
is
that
at
that
point
there
would
have
been
conflicting
obligations
imposed
on
the
secretary
of
the
treasury.
that
is,
the
secretary
was
told
in
the
social
security
act
as
amended
to
intercept
certain
refunds
whereas
under
section
6402,
prior
to
its
amendment,
these
same
refunds
were
to
be
paid
through
a
taxpayer,
and
so
it
was
necessary
in
order
to
reconcile
the
internal
revenue
code
to
amend
the
part
of
the
quote
that
dealt
with
overpayments,
namely,
6402.
however,
there
is
no
reason
to
read
section
6402
as
granting
authority
that
is
any
broader
than
that
which
is
included
in
464
of
the
social
security
act,
subsection
(a),
and
the
express
language
of
6402(c)
as
emphasized
by
the
courts
of
appeal,
with
the
exception
of
the
ninth
circuit,
says
that
overpayments
are
to
be
reduced,
but
in
accordance
with
section
464
of
the
social
security
act.
mr.
peter
greenfield
that's
correct.
mr.
peter
greenfield
that's
correct.
mr.
peter
greenfield
that's
correct,
your
honor.
section
2331
of
obra
created
in
subsection
(a)
464
of
the
social
security
act.
it
amended
in
subsection
(b)
section
454
of
the
social
security
act,
and
it
amended
in
subsection
(c)
section
6402
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
let
me
turn
to
the
issue
of
congressional
purpose.
as
i
said
earlier,
when
congress
adopted
2331
of
obra,
it
was
concerned
about
support
of
children.
it
was
also
concerned
with
reducing
the
cost
of
the
afdc
program,
but
this
was
not
clearly
its
exclusive
concern
because
the
easiest
way
to
do
that
would
have
been
to
simply
cut
back
the
afdc
program.
it
would
have
made
no
sense
in
considering
how
to
fund
a
program
designed
to
help
needy
children
to
simply
dip
into
benefits
that
congress
only
a
few
years
earlier
had
established
for
another
group
of
needy
children
whose
parents
worked,
and
rob
those
children
to
fund
a
program
for
another
set
of
children.
it
would
have
frustrated
all
of
the
purposes
of
the
earned
income
credit
benefit
program.
the
work
incentive
purpose
elaborated
in
the
senate
report
referred
to
in
our
briefs
obviously
would
be
eliminated
if
earned
income
credit
benefits
were
interceptable,
because,
of
course,
afdc
benefits
are
exempt,
and
the
less
emphasized
purpose
of
stimulating
the
economy
would
also
have
been
lessened
if
the
money
wasn't
paid
to
these
needy
families,
and
presumably
promptly
used.
we
are
talking
about
not
a
large
benefit.
the
maximum
in
1982
was
$<five
hundred>
[=
500].
but
for
many
families
this
was
approximately
10
percent
of
their
annual
income,
and
it
came
in
the
winter
at
a
time
when
fuel
bills
were
at
their
highest.
the
legislative
history
reflects
congressional
concern
about
rising
fuel
costs
and
rising
food
costs
and
the
particularly
severe
impact
of
these
phenomena
on
working
poor
families,
and
allowing
the
interception
of
these
benefits
would
simply
frustrate
the
purposes
of
that
program.
now,
the
language
which
congress
chose
in
adopting
the
tax
intercept
program
is
very
limited
and
very
clear.
it
applies
to
refunds
of
federal
taxes
paid.
earned
income
credit
benefits
are
not
refunds
of
federal
taxes
paid,
so
in
reading
the
authorization
as
broadly
as
he
has
done,
the
secretary
has
simply
ignored
the
plain
language
used
by
congress.
mr.
peter
greenfield
justice
stevens--
mr.
peter
greenfield
--justice
stevens,
if
you
look
at
the
language
as
it
appears
in
the
statute,
and
it
is
underscored
in
subsection
(a)--
mr.
peter
greenfield
--it
doesn't
say
payable
as
refunds
for
federal
taxes
paid.
what
it
says
is,
"any
amount,
as"--
mr.
peter
greenfield
"#
refunds
of
federal
taxes
paid,
payable
to
such
individual.
"
so
the
word
"payable"
and
the
phrase
"payable
to
such
individual"
was
congress's
way
of
explaining
whose
refund
of
federal
taxes
paid
was
at
issue.
now,
the
ninth
circuit
took
the
word
"payable"
and
stuck
it
before
"as"
and
came
up
with
a
very
different
argument,
but
that
isn't
the
language
used
by
congress.
mr.
peter
greenfield
that's
correct.
mr.
peter
greenfield
that's
correct.
mr.
peter
greenfield
and
there
is
a
reason.
mr.
peter
greenfield
that's
correct,
justice
stevens,
and
the
reason
for
this
seemingly
rather
awkward
phrasing,
and
that
is
that
while
the
money
is
held
by
the
treasury
it
isn't
yet
a
refund,
so
it
is
an
amount
that
would
be
a
refund
if
it
were
paid,
but
while
held
by
the
treasury
it
is
technically
simply
an
accounting
item.
so,
it
was
appropriate
to
refer
to
amounts
as
refunds
of
federal
taxes
paid
payable
to
such
individual.
now,
earlier
in
this
case,
the
government
characterized
the
phrase
"refunds
of
federal
taxes
paid"
as
ambiguous.
our
position
is,
it
is
not
ambiguous.
the
phrase
is
clear.
it
is
simply
inconsistent
with
the
government's
position,
and
especially
in
light
of
the
purpose
of
the
earned
income
credit
benefit
program,
it
would
be
extremely
inappropriate
to
stretch
this
statutory
language
to
reach
out
and
intercept
earned
income
credit
benefits.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
at
this
point,
i
will
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
thank
you.
mr.
peter
greenfield
please.
to
first
briefly
address
the
question
raised
by
justice
powell,
a
married
person
who
applies
for
an
earned
income
credit
benefit
must
file
a
joint
return,
and
in
1981
if
there
was
adjusted
gross
income
in
excess
of
$10,000,
then
there
was
no
eligibility
for
the
benefit,
so
this
is
a
program
that
only
will
benefit
poor
families
with
children.
i
would
like
to
talk
a
little
bit
more
about
section
6402(c)
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
because
i
think
the
problem
of
reconciling
that
with
what
we
take
to
be
the
clear
provision
of
464
of
the
social
security
act
seems
to
have
been
the
focus
of
some
discussion,
and
there
is
a
phrase
in
6402(c)
that
has
simply
been
ignored
by
the
secretary,
and
that
is
the
phrase,
"in
accordance
with
section
464
of
the
social
security
act.
"
so,
it
says,
that
is,
6402(c)
says,
"overpayments
shall
be
reduced",
and
we
acknowledge
that
it
is
probably
appropriate
to
treat
in
this
context
earned
income
credit
benefits
as
overpayments.
it
is
possible
to
distinguish
two
classes
of
overpayments,
but
it
is
not
necessary,
because
it
goes
on
to
say,
they
shall
be
reduced
in
accordance
with
section
464
of
the
social
security
act,
so
if--
mr.
peter
greenfield
--that
is
the
only
place
it
appears,
justice
rehnquist,
and
as
we
explain
in
more
detail
in
the
briefs,
at
first
reading
one
would
think
that
the
phrase
"in
accordance
with
section
464
of
the
social
security
act.
"
refers
to
the
notice
language
that
comes
immediately
before
it.
mr.
peter
greenfield
however,
there
is
a
good
reason
for
it
not
staying
with
that
conclusion,
and
that
is
that
section
464
does
not
impose
any
notice
obligation
on
states.
the
obligation
that
is
imposed
on
states
appears
in
section
454
of
the
social
security
act.
section
464
only
imposes
obligations
on
the
secretary
of
the
treasury.
so
it
is
entirely
appropriate
for
this
court
to
read
the
phrase
"in
accordance
with
section
464
of
the
social
security
act.
"
as
modifying
the
main
verb
in
that
sentence,
"reduced".
and
read
that
way,
there
is
no
difficulty
in
reconciling
these
two
sections.
mr.
peter
greenfield
yes.
there
is
a
requirement
in
section
454
that
states
participate
in
the
intercept
program.
so
there
is
elsewhere
a
requirement
imposed
on
states
to
take
actions,
and
there
are
also
regulations
requiring
the
states
to
give
notice.
but
section
464
itself
does
not
require
states
to
give
notice.
mr.
peter
greenfield
section
464
of
the
social
security
act
requires
interception
of
refunds
of
federal
taxes
paid.
that
is
correct.
it
requires
the
secretary
to
intercept
such
refunds
of
federal
taxes
paid.
let
me
speak
a
little
bit
about
section
6305.
as
justice
stevens
correctly
observed,
there
is
no
indication
that
it
has
ever
been
used
to
take
an
earned
income
credit
benefit.
there
is
another
important
difference
between
section
6305,
which
we
have
called
the
alternative
collection
method,
and
the
intercept
method,
and
that
is
that
states
are
required
to
use
the
intercept
method.
that
is,
if
a
debt
is
owed
to
a
state,
it
is
required
to
certify
the
name
of
a
debtor
to
the
secretary
of
the
treasury,
regardless
of
whether
the
state
would
want
to
collect
against
the
individual.
for
example,
in
petitioner's
case,
while
it
is
true
there
is
no
dispute
that
petitioner's
husband
owed
child
support
to
the
state,
it
is
also
undisputed
that
he
was
disabled,
and
that
he
and
his
wife
and
a
dependent
child
living
on
very
low
income,
it
would
have
been
entirely
appropriate
for
the
state
to
determine
that
that
isn't
an
appropriate
case
to
pursue
collection
in.
however,
they
were
required
to
use
the
intercept
program.
they
were
not
required
to
use
the
alternative
method.
mr.
peter
greenfield
it
does
not
impose
an
obligation
on
the
state.
mr.
peter
greenfield
it
refers
to
notice
several
times;
also
at
the
end
of
464(a)
it
refers
to
notice,
but
464(a)
is
imposing
an
obligation
on
the
secretary,
and
when
the
secretary
complies
with
that
obligation,
he
is
acting
in
accordance
with
section
464(a).
when
a
state
gives
notice
to
the
secretary,
the
state
is
acting
in
accordance
with
section
454,
and
in
accordance
with
whatever
regulations
require
notice,
but
it
is
not
acting
in
accordance
with
464
because
no
obligation
is
imposed
by
464.
now,
if
there
were
no
other
way
of
making
sense
out
of
this
statute,
it
might
be
tempting
to
strain
to
say
that
is...
that
these
oblique
references
to
notice
are
what
was
referred
to
in
6402(c),
but
there
is
no
need
to
strain
in
that
way,
because
there
is
a
perfectly
acceptable
interpretation
which
gives
meaning
to
the
primary
text
in
section
2331
of
obra,
that
is,
subsection
(a),
which
creates
and
establishes
the
tax
intercept
program.
there
has
been
reference
also
in
respect
to
6305
to
its
being
more
cumbersome,
and
that
is
the
reason
that
it
isn't
used,
and
as
this
court
very
well
knows,
the
collection
methods
available
to
the
irs
are
perhaps
among
the
least
cumbersome
collection
methods
known
in
this
country.
they
are
extraordinary
powers.
and
the
reason,
we
submit,
that
it
is
not
so
frequently
used
is
that
in
many
respects
it
is
simply
duplicative
of
state
procedures.
states
have
programs
to
collect
child
support,
and
if
the
debtor
is
in
the
state,
it
is
rarely
necessary
to
invoke
the
assistance
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
in
order
to
garnish
wages
or
seize
property
or
use
any
of
those
kinds
of
remedies.
so,
6305
would
simply
be
used,
for
example,
if
the
debtor
were
out
of
state.
but
it
also,
since
it
is
discretionary,
since
a
state
need
not
use
it,
it
allows
the
state
to
do
its
collection
business
in
what
we
would
submit
is
a
more
appropriate
way.
and
to
give
one
example,
one
of
the
class
members
in
this
case
filed
a
declaration
explaining
that
her
husband
had
an
agreement
with
the
state
to
make
payments
toward
a
child
support
obligation,
and
he
was
current
in
his
obligation.
now,
nonetheless,
he
had
an
outstanding
debt,
so
the
state
was
required
to
certify
his
name,
and
his
refund
was
intercepted.
however,
the
state
would
not
be
required...
in
that
case
i
should
emphasize
it
was
only
a
refund
of
federal
taxes
paid.
it
was
not
under
an
income
credit
benefit.
however,
the
state
would
not
have
been
required
and
surely
would
not
have
asked
the
secretary
to
use
the
6305
procedure
because
in
exercise
of
its
discretion
and
also
its
responsibility
under
the
agreement
it
would
have
made
its
arrangement
with
the
debtor
and
it
would
follow
it.
so,
there
are
many
good
reasons
for
the
relative
little
use
of
section
6305.
in
conclusion,
let
me
simply
say
that
there
is
a
clear
statutory
provision
before
the
court.
it
is
in
the
first
section
of
2331.
it
authorizes
the
interception
of
refunds
of
federal
taxes
paid.
as
the
secretary
concedes,
earned
income
credit
benefits
are
not
refunds
of
federal
taxes
paid.
there
is
no
need
to
strain
the
statutory
language
when
the
only
result
is
to
take
benefits
from
a
particularly
needy
group
of
children.
thank
you
very
much.
