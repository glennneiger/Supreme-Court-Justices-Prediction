william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
greenfield,
i
have
a
little
trouble
with
all
of
the
sections.
section
2331
refers
to
a
section
of
the
obra,
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
section
6401
and
6402
refer
to
sections
of
the
internal
revenue
code?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
there
are
some
other...
454
is
a
section
of
the
social
security
act.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
section
of
the
code
again
is
it
that
makes
earned
income
credit
overpayment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
don't
the
courts
ordinarily
give
some
deference
to
the
construction
of
the
secretary
in
the
event
there
is
an
ambiguity?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
have
been
doing
it
for
years.
0
[generallaughter.]
that
is
the
constant
refrain
from
agencies.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
will.

[generallaughter.]
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say...
i
see
in
the
copy
of
the
section
i've
got
where...
the
requirement,
the
secretary
has
been
notified
by
a
state
in
accordance
with
section...
does
it
use,
in
accordance
with
the
social
security
somewhere
else
in
that--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--one
certainly
would,
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
the
secretary
ever
be
notified
by
a
state
so
that
your
construction
would
make
sense
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
greenfield,
i
understood
your
response
about
section
6402(c)
as
to
which
phrase
was
modified
by
the
notice
requirement
in
there
to
be
in
part
that
section
464
didn't
deal
with
notification
by
the
state.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
does
say...
464
says
at
the
beginning,
upon
receiving
notice
from
a
state
agency
administering...
so
it
certainly
refers
to
it.
