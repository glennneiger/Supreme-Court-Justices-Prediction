mr.
richard
farber
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
there
are
three
points
i
would
like
to
make
this
morning.
the
first
one
is
that
the
decision
below
is
in
accord
with
both
the
language
of
the
social
security
act
and
the
concurrent
provisions
in
the
internal
revenue
code.
moreover,
the
decision
below
is
the
only
one
that
makes
sense
in
light
of
the
overall
statutory
scheme
enacted
by
congress
for
dealing
with
this
increasing
problem
of
non-payment
of
child
support
obligations,
and
finally,
there
are
no
considerations
of
social
policy
that
provide
any
basis
for
ignoring
the
clear
mandate
of
the
statutory
provisions
involved.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
has
tried
hard
to
read
the
intercept
provisions
as
applying
only
to
actual
refunds
of
taxes
paid.
now,
if
that
were
the
language
and
the
intent
of
congress,
there
wouldn't
be
much
to
argue
about
this
morning,
because
it
is
quite
clear
that
earned
income
credits
are
not
actual
refunds
of
taxes
paid.
however,
the
language
employed
by
congress
does
not
say
refunds
of
taxes
paid.
the
petitioner
tries
very
hard
to
ignore
the
provisions
of
the
internal
revenue
code
which
form
part
of
the
intercept
provision.
they
were
enacted
concurrently
with
the
social
security
act.
the
provisions
of
the
internal
revenue
code
speak
in
terms
of
overpayment.
any
overpayment
may
be
intercepted.
that
is
what
section
6402(c)
says.
section
6401(b)
expressly
defines
an
excess
earned
income
credit,
meaning
the
extent
to
which
the
credit
exceeds
the
tax
liability,
as
an
overpayment.
when
you
put
these
two
sections
together,
the
obvious
conclusion
is
that
earned
income
credits
may
be
intercepted
because
they
are
overpayments,
and
section
6402(c)
by
its
express
terms
refers
to
any
overpayment.
the
position
taken
by
the
petitioner
also
results
in
an
inconsistency
within
section
6402
itself.
6402(a)
is
the
provision
which
authorizes
the
commissioner
to
make
refunds
of
overpayments.
in
fact,
it
directs
the
secretary
to
refund
any
overpayment.
now,
if
an
earned
income
credit
were
not
an
overpayment,
it
couldn't
be
refunded
at
all,
and
this
issue
could
never
have
arisen,
so
it
must
be
conceded,
and
both
the
second
and
tenth
circuits
have
conceded
that
earned
income
credits
are
overpayments
for
purposes
of
subsection
(a)
of
section
6402
and
therefore
may
be
refunded.
however,
when
congress
enacted
the
intercept
program
in
1981,
it
specifically
amended
section
6402(a)
to
provide
that
the
secretary's
obligation
to
refund
an
overpayment
under
that
subsection
is
subject
to
the
provisions
of
subsection
(c).
now,
that
is
the
express
cross
reference.
and
subsection
(c),
of
course,
specifically
says
that
in
the
case
of
any
overpayment
due
to
a
person
who
is
indebted
for
past
due
child
support,
the
amount
of
the
overpayment
is
to
be
reduced
by
the
amount
of
the
past
due
support.
in
light
of
this
integrated
statutory
scheme,
there
is
simply
no
way
to
maneuver
out
of
the
conclusion
that
earned
income
credits,
since
they
are
overpayments
under
the
code,
are
subject
to
interception.
mr.
richard
farber
section
6401(b).
all
the
relevant
statutes
are
set
out
in
the
appendix
to
the
government's
brief.
mr.
richard
farber
i
believe,
that
the
petitioner
passed
out.
mr.
richard
farber
the
second
and
tenth
circuits--
mr.
richard
farber
--it
was
part
of
the
'54
code.
mr.
richard
farber
it
was
amended
when...
the
earned
income
credit
was
enacted
in
1975
as
part
of
the
tax
reduction
act.
at
that
time
congress
amended
6401(b)
to
make
earned
income
credits
one
of
the
few
credits
that
are
treated
as
overpayments.
most
credits
are
not
overpayments,
and
if
they
exceed
your
tax
liability,
they
are
gone.
certain
credits
are
considered
to
be...
are
treated
as
refundable
credits,
and
are
treated
as
if
you
overpaid
your
tax.
mr.
richard
farber
well,
it
was
last
amended
as
relevant
here
in
1975.
that
was
the
time
when
congress
passed
the
earned
income
credit,
and
in
order
to
make
that
a
refundable
credit,
it
was
necessary
to
define
an
earned
income
credit
as
an
overpayment,
and
to
do
that,
they
amended
section
6401(b).
mr.
richard
farber
yes,
that's
correct.
they
have
been
overpayments
since--
mr.
richard
farber
--that
is
exactly
correct,
because
in
1975
when
congress
amended
6401(b)
to
define
earned
income
credit
as
an
overpayment,
6402(a)
already
provided
that
in
the
case
of
any
overpayment,
the
secretary
was
required
to
refund
it.
mr.
richard
farber
i
don't
believe
they
would
get
the
credit
unless
they
filed
a
return
and
claimed
it.
mr.
richard
farber
well,
to
be
an
eligible
individual,
you
either
have
to
be
a
head
of
household,
a
surviving
spouse,
or
a
married
individual
supporting
a
dependent
child
who
lives
with
you.
those
are
the
categories.
then
there
are
income
limitations.
you
must
have...
it
only
applies
to
earned
income,
10
percent
of
earned
income
up
to
a
maximum
of
5,000,
so
that
would
be
a
maximum
credit
of
$500.
it
decreases...
the
credit
decreases
proportionately
to
the
extent
your
earned
income
is
more
than
$6,000,
and
at
$10,000
there
is
no
more
credit.
but
basically
up
to
$5,000
it
is
the
first
10
percent
of
earned
income,
and
if
you
have
no
tax
liability
whatsoever,
you
filed
a
return
and
claimed
a
credit
and
you
receive
a
check.
it
is
treated
as
if
you
have
overpaid
your
taxes,
even
though
in
fact
you
may
have
paid
no
taxes
whatsoever.
mr.
richard
farber
i
believe
only
one
person
would
be
eligible
because
in
order
to
be
eligible
you
have
to
be
the
one
entitled
to
claim
a
dependency
exemption,
meaning
you
have
to
provide
more
than
half
the
support,
so
only
one
of
the
spouses
would
be
eligible
to
claim
the
credit.
mr.
richard
farber
that
is--
mr.
richard
farber
--well,
presumably
if
the
spouse
earned
a
lot
more,
the
person
claiming
the
credit
might
find
it
difficult
to
prove
that
they
provided
half
the
support
of
the
dependent,
and
then
they
wouldn't
be
eligible
for
the
credit
in
the
first
place.
mr.
richard
farber
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
farber
as
far
as
i
am
aware,
justice
stevens,
congress
did
not
mention
earned
income
credit
one
way
or
the
other
when
it
passed
the
intercept
program.
our
position,
of
course,
is
that
its
language
was
so
all-encompassing
that
it
necessarily
includes
earned
income
credits
because
of
the
way
that
the
code
is
set
up.
the
position
of
the
petitioner
and
of
the
second
and
tenth
circuits
in
the
nelson
and
bucker
cases
is
based
exclusively
on
the
language
of
a
parallel
provision,
section
464
of
the
social
security
act,
which
was
enacted
concurrently
with
section
6402(c)
of
the
code.
they
read
this
provision
as
authorizing
only
interceptions
of
actual
tax
refunds,
and
they
say
that
is...
and
earned
income
credit
is
not
an
actual
tax
refund,
and
that
is
the
end
of
the
case.
of
course,
their
position
requires
ignoring
the
parallel
provisions
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
which
speaks
clearly
in
terms
of
overpayment,
so
their
position
requires
creating
an
inconsistency
between
two
concurrent
provisions
which
were
part
of
the
same
program.
in
our
view,
the
interpretation
of
the
court
below
is
correct
and
avoids
any
inconsistencies.
the
court
below
read
section
464
as
applied
not
to
just
tax
refunds.
the
section
says,
in
the
case
of
any
amounts
as
refunds
of
taxes
paid
which
are
payable,
and
in
our
view
the
only
logical
interpretation,
judging
in
light
of
the
concurrent
provisions
of
section
6402(c)
is,
is
that
congress
meant
that
any
amounts
payable
as
refunds
of
taxes
paid
are
subject
to
interception,
and
there
is
no
question
that
earned
income
credits
are
payable
as
refunds
of
taxes
paid.
that
is
the
only
way
they
can
be
refunded.
there
is
no
other
authority
under
which
the
secretary
could
make
a
refund
of
an
earned
income
credit
other
than
the
fact
that
it
is
treated
under
the
code
as
an
overpayment
of
tax.
in
our
view,
there
is
no
inconsistency
between
these
two
provisions.
they
both
apply
to
amounts
payable
as
refunds.
earned
income
credits
are
payable
as
refunds.
we
think
this
conclusion
becomes
even
more
apparent
when
one
looks
at
an
antecedent
provision
enacted
in
1975,
and
that
is
section
6305
of
the
code.
that
was
enacted
as
part
of
the
social
services
amendment
of
1974.
under
that
provision,
congress
authorized
and
directed
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
upon
receiving
certification
from
hhs
through
the
states
to
collect
child
support
that
had
been
assigned
to
a
state
as
if
it
were
a
delinquent
federal
employment
tax.
delinquent
taxes
may
be
collected
out
of
any
property
or
rights
to
property
belonging
to
the
taxpayer
and
may
be
collected
from
any
means,
including
levy
and...
liens,
tax
sales,
and
other
means
available
to
the
irs.
although
there
are
few
exemptions
of
property
interests
that
may
not
be
collected
for
federal
taxes,
there
is
no
exemption
for
earned
income
credits.
thus,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
when
congress
enacted
6305,
it
authorized
the
collection,
the
seizure,
if
the
court
will,
of
earned
income
credits.
once
they
have
been
actually
paid
out
by
the
treasury
and
are
in
the
hands
of
the
recipient,
the
irs
could
turn
around
once
the
matter
was
certified
and
seize
those
credits
back.
mr.
richard
farber
section
6305
has
not
been
widely
used.
mr.
richard
farber
my
understanding
is,
it
has
been
used
several
thousand
times,
but
it
is
not
very
cost
efficient,
and
requires
locating
the
person
who
is
indebted,
locating
its
assets,
and
then
using
somewhat
cumbersome
means
to
actually
reduce
those
assets
to
possession.
in
fact,
the
reason
congress
passed
the
intercept
program
was
that
it
felt
that
existing
authority
was
just
too
cumbersome,
wasn't
cost
effective.
mr.
richard
farber
they
didn't
focus
in
on
earned
income.
mr.
richard
farber
excuse
me,
your
honor.
i
misunderstood.
they
have
used
section
6305
to
collect
past
due
supports
several
thousands
of
times.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
and
i
am
not
aware
of
any--
mr.
richard
farber
--i
have
no
specific
indication
as
to
whether
it
has
ever
been
used.
mr.
richard
farber
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
power
is
there,
that
it
could
be
used,
and
that
if
the
court
were
to
hold
that
these
earned
income
credits
couldn't
be
intercepted,
it
would
not
be
immunizing
these
credits
from
collections
for
past
due
support,
as
petitioners
suggest,
because
they
still
could
be
subject
to
collection.
it
just
would
require
that
a
more
costly
method
be
used.
for
whatever
reason
these
other
methods
have
not
been
used,
and
i
would
suggest
the
principal
reason
is
the
cost.
the
fact
remains
that
they
could
be
collected
that
way,
and
so
it
makes
little
sense
to
say
that
when
congress
passed
the
intercept
provisions,
which
it
intended
to
enhance
existing
collection
authority,
it
intended
to
immunize
earned
income
credits
from
this
new
streamlined
cost
effective
procedure
and
to
require
if--
mr.
richard
farber
--well,
your
honor,
except
that
it
didn't...
when
it
authorized
collection
of
child
support
as
delinquent
taxes,
it
didn't
pass
any
exemption
for
earned
income
credit,
and
so
there
is
no
limitation
to
stop
the
states
from
seeking
to
use
this
power,
and
so
congress
has
not
protected
earned
income
credits
in
this
earlier
broad
power,
and
so
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
it
intended
to
do
so
when
it
enhanced
this
collection
authority.
it
also--
mr.
richard
farber
--well,
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
indication
of
that.
mr.
richard
farber
i
am
not
aware
of
any
instances
in
which
they
collected
that
way.
i
would
point
out
that
when
congress
passed
the
predecessor
provision,
section
6305,
not
only
didn't
it
exempt
earned
income
credits
from
its
scope,
but
it
eliminated
certain
of
the
exemptions
that
already
are
available
for
tax
collection,
most
notably
unemployment
benefits.
unemployment
benefits
by
statute
may
not
be
collected
for
past
due
taxes.
however,
when
congress
enacted
section
6305,
it
specifically
eliminated
that
exemption,
so
that
unemployment
benefits
may
be
collected
for
past
due
support.
now,
there
was
no
need
to
get
rid
of
any
exemption
for
earned
income
credits,
because
there
wasn't
one
in
the
first
place,
but
that
shows
the
depth
of
congress's
interest
in
seeing
that
these
child
support
debts
are
collected.
mr.
richard
farber
i
am
not
familiar
with
that
specific
provision,
justice
blackmun,
but
there
have
been
many
provisions
in
the
code
dealing
with
earned
income.
at
one
point
in
time
there
was
a
maximum
tax
on
earned
income
of
50
percent
as
opposed
to
dividends
and
other
types
of
passive
income
which
were
subject
to
rates
in
excess
of
70
percent.
so,
the
term
"earned
income"
is
one
of
art
that
has
been
used
throughout
the
years
in
the
internal
revenue
code.
mr.
richard
farber
i
don't
doubt
it,
justice
blackmun.
mr.
richard
farber
no,
i
didn't
mean
that.
0
[generallaughter.]
in
our
view,
the
provisions
are
clear
on
their
face,
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
which
shows
that
congress
didn't
mean
what
it
said--
mr.
richard
farber
--yes,
your
honor,
i
would
concede
that,
because
if
there
wasn't
an
ambiguity
there,
i
don't
think
we
would
have
lost
this
case
in
the
second
and
tenth--
mr.
richard
farber
--well,
that
is
the
problem,
your
honor,
is
that
these
two
sections,
6402(c)
and
section
464
were
both
passed
concurrently
in
1981
as
part
of
obra.
so
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
that
congress
intended
these
two
concurrent
and
parallel
provisions
to
have
different
meanings.
now,
if
there
is
an
ambiguity
in
section
464,
our
view
is
that,
well,
let's
look
at
the
internal
revenue
code,
and
there
is
no
ambiguity
over
there.
i
don't
think
petitioner
has
even
tried
to
suggest
one.
certainly
the
second
and
tenth
circuits
haven't.
they
just
ignored
it.
but
if
you
look
at
the
language
over
there,
the
technical
language
about
overpayments
are
subject
to
interception,
and
earned
income
credits
are
expressly
defined
as
overpayments,
there
is
no
ambiguity--
mr.
richard
farber
--yes.
mr.
richard
farber
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
farber
well,
but
the
language
it
used
is
all
encompassing,
because
when
it
chose
to
add
this
intercept
provision,
it
amended
section
a,
which
directs
the
refunds
of
overpayment
to
say
the
secretary
shall,
subject
to
subsection
(c),
refund
the
amount
of
any
overpayment,
and
then
in
subsection
(c)
it
says,
in
the
case
of
any
overpayment
the
amount
of
past
due
support
is
to
be
applied
against
that
overpayment.
so,
its
language
is
all-encompassing.
there
is
absolutely
not
a
word
in
the
legislative
history
which
indicates
that
congress
went
too
far,
didn't
mean
what
it
said
when
it
used
that
broad
language,
that
had
it
thought
about
it,
it
would
have
excluded--
mr.
richard
farber
--well,
certainly
when
regulations
have
been
promulgated
there
is
great
deference,
but
i
suppose
it
might
be
viewed
as
somewhat
bootstrapping
if
we
came
here
and
said
we
are
right
because
we
said
we
are
right.
mr.
richard
farber
maybe
i
haven't
been
here
enough
to
get
the
party
line.
mr.
richard
farber
in
our
view,
if
the
decision
below
were
to
be
reversed,
you
would
be
creating
this
conflict
among
concurrent
sections,
and
i
again
would
emphasize--
mr.
richard
farber
--well,
except
that
the
internal
revenue
code
provision
purports
to
be
an
independent
authority.
it
mandates
the
interception
of
any
overpayment.
it
doesn't
say,
you
know,
as
provided
in
section
<four
sixty-four>
[=
464].
it
doesn't
purport
to
be
limited
by
section
464.
and
once
again,
i
would
emphasize
that
congress
has
already
authorized
the
collection
of
earned
income
credits
through
various
means
once
they
have
been
paid
out,
and
in
light
of
that
authorization,
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
say
that
congress
intended
when
it
enacted
the
intercept
provision
to
carve
out
an
exception
for
earned
income
credits
and
say
you
can't--
mr.
richard
farber
--well,
congress
may
work
at
cross
purposes
sometimes,
but
i
don't
think
it
is
quite--
mr.
richard
farber
--well,
i
don't
think
it
is
that
clear,
justice
stevens.
mr.
richard
farber
well,
i
think...
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
so
because
over
the
past
35
years
it
has
expressed
increasing
concern
about
the
rapid
growth
of
people,
families
on
afdc.
the
principal
cause
of
families
on
afdc
has
been
identified
as
the
problem
of
deserting
parents,
most
notably
fathers,
and
congress
has
taken
stringent
efforts
to
collect
these
past
due
supports.
now,
in
this
case--
mr.
richard
farber
--well,
justice
stevens,
what
happens
here
is
that
because
someone
like
petitioner's
husband
did
not
pay
his
child
support,
and
it
is
undisputed
he
is
in
debt
for
child
support,
his
former
wife
had
to
go
on
welfare.
as
a
condition
to
going
on
welfare,
she
was
required
to
assign
her
support
rights
to
the
state,
and
now
the
state
is
seeking
to
try
and
reimburse
its
costs
to
a
certain
extent,
but
the
point
remains
that
mr.
sorenson
failed
to
honor
his
support
obligations.
mr.
richard
farber
well,
that
might
well--
mr.
richard
farber
--that
same
argument
could
be
made
with
respect
to
unemployment
benefits,
and
as
i
have
pointed
out,
when
congress
enacted
section
6305,
it
specifically
repealed
the
exemption
for
unemployment
benefits.
now,
those
are
paid
by
the
federal
government,
but
congress
said
we
want
those
benefits
available
for
seizure
for
payment
of
past
due
supports
that
have
assigned
to
a
state.
now,
in
view
of
that
specific
action,
i
see
no
inconsistency
with
congress
drawing
the
same
conclusion
with
earned
income
credits,
another
benefit
provided
by
the
federal
government.
mr.
richard
farber
well,
i
am
not
sure
that
that
is
entirely
true.
the
earned--
mr.
richard
farber
--that
is
true,
your
honor,
but
it
really
was
an
incentive
for
low
income
people
to
work
rather
than
to
receive
welfare.
it
was
intended
to
negate
the
impact
of
social
security
taxes
that
they
would
incur
by
working,
and
so
it
was
intended
really
as
a
refund
of
social
security
taxes
more
than
anything
else.
mr.
richard
farber
well,
not
entirely,
justice
white.
in
the
first
place,
the
earned
income
credit
isn't
simply
covered
into
the
state
treasury.
it
reduces
their
existing
lawful
debt
dollar
for
dollar,
so
they
do
get
a
direct
economic
benefit
from
this...
well,
let's
say
a
$500
credit.
it
reduces
their
debt
that
they
owe
to
a
state,
so
they
do
get
a
benefit
from
it.
it
is
not
like
it
just
is
collected
as
a
tax
and
it
is
lost
to
them
and
they
have
received
no
benefits.
mr.
richard
farber
i
don't
think
i
follow
that.
mr.
richard
farber
i
believe
it
is,
but
maybe
more
principally
to
try
and
collect
against
those
people
who
have
no
intention
of
voluntarily
paying,
and
there
is
a
huge
amount
out
there.
i
would
give
the
court
some
figures.
during
the
first
three
and
a
half
years
of
the
intercept
program,
the
total
amount
of
tax
refunds
that
have
been
intercepted
are
approaching
or
may
be
slightly
in
excess
of
$900
million.
of
this
amount,
the
earned
income
credit
component
is
estimated
to
be
somewhere
between
15
to
20
percent.
so,
the
intercept
program
has
been
quite
successful.
we
are
only
talking
about
one
small
part
of
it
here,
the
earned
income
credit
component,
but
the
overall
program
has
collected
some
$900
million
that
otherwise
may
not
have
been
collected,
and
the
figures
indicate
that
the
amount
of
the
interceptions
are
increasing
at
an
increasing
rate
each
year,
so
in
future
years
the
collections
may
be
even
greater.
one
other
point
i
would
like
to
make,
that
this
case
has
been
painted
sort
of
as
a
battle
against
a
poor
individual
versus
the
state,
but
in
1984,
congress
has
expanded
the
intercept
program
to
allow
collection,
interception
of
refunds
on
behalf
of
children
who
aren't
on
afdc.
now,
these
children
may
be
quite
needy
and
it
may
well
be
that
if
these
collections
are
made
they
won't
have
to
go
on
afdc,
and
these
amounts
that
will
be
collected
beginning
in
january
of
'86
will
not
go
to
the
state.
the
state
will
receive
them
from
the
irs,
but
they
will
pay
them
out
to
individual
families,
and
the
court's
decision
here
will
directly
impact
on
this
later
amendment.
if
the
court
should
hold
that
earned
income
credits
are
immune
under
the
intercept
program,
then
they
couldn't
be
paid
for
these
individuals
as
well
as
paid
to
the
states.
so
the
decision
here
is
quite
far-reaching,
but
the
expansion
to
individual
cases
once
again
shows
congress's
concern
in
this
area
to
stop
the...
or
put
a
halt
to
the
increasing
problem
of
non-payment
of
child
support
and
to
stop
the
growth
of
afdc.
it
is
felt
that
by
enforcing
child
support
payments
from
people
who
have
not
yet
gone
on
afdc,
that
it
may
stop
them
from
having
to
apply
for
welfare.
i
don't
believe
i
have
anything
else.
