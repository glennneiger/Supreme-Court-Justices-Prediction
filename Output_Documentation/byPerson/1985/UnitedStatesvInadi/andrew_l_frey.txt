mr.
andrew
l.
frey
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
question
before
the
court
today
is
whether
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
are
unconstitutional
insofar
as
they
permit
the
introduction
in
evidence
in
a
criminal
trial
of
co-conspirator
declarations
without
requiring
the
prosecution
to
produce
the
declare
or
to
demonstrate
his
unavailability.
now,
in
terms
of
potential
impact,
this
may
be
the
most
important
critical
procedure
case
that
the
court
has
had
to
decide
in
the
years
that
i
have
been
in
the
solicitor
general's
office.
while
affirmance
of
the
third
circuit's
decision
would
probably
have
little
impact
on
the
trial
as
seen
by
the
jurors,
the
behind
the
scenes
effect
on
the
allocation
of
criminal
justice
system
resources
would
be
dramatic.
on
this
case,
which
was
a
drug
prosecution,
the
prosecution
sought
to
use
five
recorded
conversations
as
evidence
against
respondent.
three
of
those
conversations
he
was
a
party
to,
and
we're
between
him
and
a
co-conspirator,
john
lazaro.
a
fourth
conversation
was
between
two
individuals
who
testified
as
prosecution
witnesses
at
trial,
and
the
fifth
conversation
was
between
lazaro
and
a
co-conspirator
named
levin,
who
invoked
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
and
was
found
unavailable
at
trial.
respondent
demanded
that
the
prosecution
show
the
unavailability
of
any
co-conspirator
declarants,
and
to
accommodate
the
district
court's
practical
wishes,
the
prosecution
did
subpoena
lazaro
to
appear
for
trial,
but
he
failed
to
appear,
allegedly
due
to
car
troubles.
ultimately,
the
district
court
ruled
that
lazaro's
statements
on
these
intercepted
conversations
were
admissible
under
the
traditional
co-conspirator
exception
now
embodied
in
rule
801
of
the
federal
rules
of
evidence.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
it,
too,
found
that
rule
801
was
satisfied,
but
it
found
that
the
confrontation
clause
was
violated
because
the
prosecution
had
not
satisfactorily
demonstrated
that
the
co-conspirator
lazaro
was
unavailable
to
testify
at
trial.
now,
in
reaching
this
ruling,
it
relied
almost
entirely
on
dicta
from
this
court's
decision
in
ohio
against
roberts.
we
have
discussed
at
some
length
in
our
brief
both
the
historical
evolution
of
the
confrontation
right
of
common
law
and
its
adoption
in
the
sixth
amendment
and
the
parallel
but
distinct
development
of
the
hearsay
rule
and
exceptions,
including
the
co-conspirator
exception,
and
i
have
no
intention
of
repeating
that
here.
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
co-conspirator
exception
emerged
simultaneously
with
the
adoption
of
the
confrontation
right
and
the
sixth
amendment,
and
as
it
was
refined
during
the
period
from
1780
to
1980,
it
was,
as
far
as
i
know,
never
suggested
by
any
court
or
any
legislature
that
a
showing
of
unavailability
of
the
extrajudicial
declarant,
co-conspirator,
was
required.
and
the
same
is
true,
i
might
add,
of
the
vast
majority
of
other
hearsay
exceptions
and
exemptions.
can
it
be
that
the
judges,
the
legislators,
the
practitioners,
and
the
scholars
who
have
contributed
to
the
evolution
of
the
common
law
of
evidence
over
this
period
and
who
contributed
to
the
federal
rules
of
evidence,
and
in
doing
so,
who
took
into
account
in
their
consideration
of
hearsay
rules
the
very
same
interests
that
are
said
to
underlie
the
confrontation
clause,
can
it
be
that
all
of
these
people
have
so
consistently
violated
fundamental
principles
of
fair
play
embodied
in
the
somewhat
vague
and
general
language
of
the
sixth
amendment?
can
it
be
that
for
decade
after
decade,
thousands
of
state
as
well
as
federal
courtrooms
across
the
land
have
seen
the
basic
right
of
confrontation
repeatedly
violated
by
the
admission
of
co-conspirator
declarations
without
any
showing
of
the
unavailability
of
the
declarant?
we
think
that
is
not
possible.
far
more
likely,
in
our
opinion,
is
the
view
that
the
dictum
in
ohio
against
roberts
referred
to
the
class
of
cases,
that
is,
prior
testimony
and
the
like,
in
which
the
unavailability
requirement
in
this
court's
decisions
cited
in
roberts
parallel
a
similar
development
of
the
hearsay
rules.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
am
not
sure
that
i
am
aware
of
what
you
are
referring
to.
as
far
as
i
know,
and
as
far
as
i
recollect
from
the
respondent's
brief,
the
development
of
this
requirement
of
production
or
showing
of
unavailability
is
all
post-1980,
post
the
dictum
in
ohio
against
roberts,
and
it
has
happened
in
a
number
of
federal
courts,
and
i
believe
that
when
this
court
speaks
even
in
dictum,
it
does
have
a
powerful
effect
on
people.
i
can't
tell
you
what
the
experience
has
been,
but
i
do
hope
to
address
some
of
the
reasons
why
i
think
the
costs
and
benefits
clearly
suggest
that
it
is
a
bad
rule.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
would
be
only
a
small
part
of
the
problem.
that
would
be
a
part
of
the
problem,
and
that
would
be
something
that
would
have
to
be
fleshed
out
over
out
over
probably
decades
of
litigation
and
numerous
cases
in
this
court,
as
it
has
taken
decades
to
flesh
out
the
unavailability
requirement
in
connection
with
prior
testimony.
now,
it
is
not
essential,
i
think,
to
the
court's
decision
here,
but
i
want
to
spend
just
a
minute
on
the
question
of
whether
the
confrontation
clause
reaches
so
far
as
to
regulate
co-conspirator
declarations
or
other
kinds
of
hearsay
generally.
we
have
argued
in
our
brief
that
it
doesn't
speak
at
all
to
co-conspirator
declarations
or
other
kinds
of
hearsay
by
and
large,
and
that
it
is
in
fact
specifically
concerned
with
prior
testimony,
depositions,
affidavits,
and
those
kinds
of
testimonial,
out
of
court
testimonial
utterances.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
a
part
of
the
rationale
for
the
co-conspirator
declaration,
and
we
would
certainly
say
that,
but
i
think
what
we
are
saying
is
broader
in
this
immediate
connection,
which
is
that
it
was
never
intended
for
the
confrontation
clause
to
concern
itself
with
most
kinds
of
hearsay.
the
early
cases
which
are
cited
at
page
22
of
our
brief,
state
cases,
suggest
that
the
witnesses
that
the
sixth
amendment
says
and
the
state
constitutional
provision
said
the
defendant
had
to
be
allowed
to
confront
are
those
people
who
appear
in
court
and
give
testimony
about
the
hearsay
declaration.
now,
i
am
not
suggesting
that
that
is
the
limit
of
the
reach
of
the
provision,
but
in
the
mattox
case
of
this
court,
which
is
the
first
case
to
really
consider
this
issue,
the
court
said
that
the
primary
object
of
the
constitutional
provision
in
question
was
to
prevent
depositions
or
ex
parte
affidavits
such
as
were
sometimes
admitted
in
civil
cases
being
used
against
a
prisoner
in
lieu
of
personal
examination
and
cross
examination
of
the
witness.
now,
that
also,
i
think,
is
to
some
extent
the
view
of
wigmore
and
justice
harlan's
view
in
concurrence
in
dutton
against
evans.
and
the
court
indicated
in
roberts
that
that
view
had
not
been
accepted
by
this
court,
and
at
the
other
extreme
is
the
view
which
i
understand
respondent
to
take
and
which
may
be
supported
by
dictum
in
dutton
and
roberts,
that
all
hearsay
is
regulated
by
the
confrontation
clause.
it
doesn't
mean
it
is
excluded.
it
means
it
is
regulated.
now,
i
would
propose
to
the
court
that
the
better
view
is
that
out
of
court
declarations
of
a
kind
that
are
retrospective
but
done
in
contemplation
of
trial,
that
are
of
a
testimonial
nature...
when
the
sixth
amendment
refers
to
a
witness,
what
it
is
referring
to
is
somebody
who
is
giving
testimony
or
the
functional
equivalent
of
testimony.
that
could
reach
so
far
as
to
include
accomplice
confessions
under
police
interrogation,
which
are
retrospective,
and
in
large
part
obtained
for
purposes
of
solving
crimes
and
litigating
cases.
it
does
not,
however,
reach
business
records,
present
sense
impression,
co-conspirator
declarations,
the
kind
of
res
gestae
exceptions
that
the
main
body
of
hearsay
exception
law
is
concerned
with.
in
any
event,
even
if
the
domain
of
the
confrontation
clause
does
embrace
hearsay
generally,
it
seems
to
us
extraordinarily
clear
that
the
clause
does
not
invalidate
traditional
evidence
law
regarding
the
exceptions
to
the
prohibition
on
use
of
hearsay.
and,
of
course,
why
should
it
do
that
when
these
exceptions
were
developed
with
consideration
of
the
very
same
concerns,
the
importance
of
cross
examination,
the
necessity
in
some
circumstances
of
withholding
from
the
jury
evidence,
or
the
necessity
of
making
it
available,
that
underlie
the
confrontation
clause.
in
cases
like
mattox
and
the
delaney
case
in
1924
which
involved
a
confrontation
clause,
co-conspirator
declarations,
brushed
off
the
suggestion
that
traditional
exceptions
to
the
hearsay
rule
might
run
afoul
of
the
confrontation
clause,
and
in
both
dutton
against
evans
and
ohio
against
roberts,
the
court
was
at
pains
to
reaffirm
that
the
traditional
exceptions
were
not
being
called
into
question
by
those
decisions.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
in
our
opinion
it
makes
absolutely
no
difference,
because
it
is
still
a
judgment
of
the
legal
community
developed
over
time
that
it
is
better
for
the
jury
to
have
than
not
to
have
this
evidence,
and
it
is
a
judgment--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
we
have
a
long
footnote
in
our
reply
brief
that
addresses
that
question.
i
would
say
that
the
exemption
is
based
on
three
different
considerations.
it
is
based
on
an
agency
rationale.
it
is
based
on
the
fact
that
co-conspirator
declarations
by
their
nature
often
involve
verbal
acts
or
other
non-hearsay,
components
because
they
are
frequently
part
of
the
res
gestae
of
the
offense
itself.
they
involve
other
kinds
of
things
that
may
be
accepted
under
rule
803
exceptions,
and
so
by
having
a
general
exception
you
save
the
court
a
very
difficult
task
of
teasing
out
the
hearsay
from
the
non-hearsay
and
the
hearsay
exceptions
from
the
non-excepted
hearsay.
and
finally,
because
there
is
an
element
of
reliability
in
statements
that
are
made
by
venturers
to
further
the
objective
of
the
venture--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--they
are
against
interest,
but
of
course
we
don't
know...
my
colleague
here
will
tell
you
that
agency
is
purely
the
rationale
and
not
reliability.
i
am
not
sure
why
she
thinks
that
helps
her.
if
agency
is
the
rationale,
why
shouldn't
the
principal
produce
this
agent
rather
than
the
principal's
accountant
in
the
litigation?
now,
of
course,
lazaro
may
no
longer
have
seen
inadi's
agent
at
the
time
of
trial,
but
the
point
that
i
think
is
important
is
that
the
decision
has
been
made
consistently
throughout
time
that
no
showing
of
unavailability
is
to
be
required
in
connection
with
co-conspirator
declarations.
how
would
you
use
the
confrontation
clause
to
veto
that
judgment?
i
just
simply
don't
see
what
you
would
look
to
as
a
source
of
arriving
at
some
different
conclusion.
now,
i
will
say
with
respect
to
the
roberts
dictum,
because
i
think
that
is
the
source
of
most
of
the
holdings
that
have
done
against
our
position,
that
i
think
they
misread
what
roberts
says.
first
of
all,
it
seems
to
me
plain
that
the
dictum
in
roberts
was
meant
to
be
descriptive
rather
than
prescriptive,
but
it
would
be
a
wholly
inaccurate
description
of
the
state
of
the
law
with
respect
to
most
co-con...
most
hearsay
exceptions
including
the
co-conspirator
declaration,
but
totally
accurate
as
an
explanations
of
the
treatment
of
depositions
and
prior
testimony?
now,
secondly,
if
you
read
the
dictum
literally,
it
goes
too
far,
because
it
not
only
imposes
the
requirement
of
showing
unavailability
and
reliability
on
co-conspirator
declarations,
but
it
invalidates
all
of
rule
803.
now,
respondent
is
going
to
try
to
get
around
that,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
if
you
read
it
literally
it
makes
rule
803
unconstitutional
as
well
as
rule
801,
if
you
don't
read
it
literally,
then
i
don't
understand
why
you
should
not
read
it
as
limited
to
the
proposition
established
by
the
cases
that
it
cites,
which
are
prior
testimony
cases?
now,
let
me
turn
to
the
question
of
policy,
because
i
do
think
that
is
what
concerns
us
so
gravely
about
the
third
circuit's
rule.
the
question
is,
assuming
that
the
court
has
the
license
under
the
constitution
to
do
so,
whether
there
is
any
reason
why
the
court,
concerned
as
it
must
be
with
fair
and
efficient
administration
of
criminal
justice,
would
want
the
unavailability
role
that
the
third
circuit
has
adopted
in
this
case.
in
other
words,
can
we
expect
significant
benefits
to
the
fairness
and
accuracy
of
the
criminal
trial
to
be
derived
at
acceptable
cost
from
this
requirement.
it
seems
to
me
the
answer
is
clearly
no.
let
me
look
first
at
the
benefits.
the
first
point
to
notice
about
the
third
circuits's
rule
is
that
it
does
not
keep
out
evidence
that
the
jury
can't
be
trusted
to
hear.
the
co-conspirator
declarations
come
in
if
the
declarant
is
shown
to
be
unavailable,
and
under
the
third
circuits's
rule,
although
i
think
not
under
the
position
that
respondent
was
requesting
in
district
court,
they
come
in
if
the
declarant
is
available
and
is
produced.
part
of
the
reason
they
come
in,
and
the
reason
why
at
least
that
part
of
the
third
circuit's
rule
is
good,
is
because
the
declarations
have
independent
evidentiary
value
apart
from
any
in
court
testimony
that
the
declarant
may
give.
there
are
statements
made
while
the
objective
of
the
illegal
transaction
was
being
advanced,
and
for
the
purpose
of
advancement.
by
the
time
the
witness
appears
in
court
many
factors
may
have
played
on
him
to
affect
his
credibility.
i
am
not
saying
in
any
given
case
which...
whether
the
co-conspirator
declaration
or
the
in
court
testimony
is
more
valuable.
however,
the
co-conspirator
declaration
is
independently
valuable,
and
it
comes
in
whether
the
declarant
is
available
or
unavailable.
the
only
time
it
doesn't
come
in,
and
the
defendant
gets
a
windfall,
is
if
the
prosecution
has
been
negligent
and
has
let
the
declarant
somehow
or
another
get
out
of
its
clutches
between
the
time
of
the
investigation
and
the
time
of
the
trial
and
it
is
found
culpable
or
negligent
having
done
so.
a
second
point,
and
more
important
in
terms
of
the
lack
of
benefit
is
it
does
not
enhance
the
ability
of
the
defendant
to
adduce
exculpatory
evidence.
after
all,
the
question
in
this
case
is
why
didn't
respondent,
if
lazaro's
testimony
was
so
important
to
him,
why
didn't
respondent
subpoena
him,
put
him
on
the
stand?
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
when
the
issue
was
raised
by
the
district
court,
respondent's
counsel
said
that
was
a
very
serious
question
whether
they
actually
wanted
respondent
to
testify.
what
they
wanted
was
the
government
to
show
that
he
was
unavailable
or
forego
the
use
of
the
co-conspirator
declarations.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
my
understanding
of
respondent's
position,
and
counsel
may
be
able
to
testify
to
that
better
than
i
could
since
she
was
counsel
at
trial,
but
i
read
page
18
of
the
joint
appendix,
which
is
where
this
discussion
is
held,
to
mean
that
if
we
could
produce
lazaro,
we
could
not
use
these
conversations
at
all.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
would
have
to
put
him
on
the
stand
or
not
put
him
on
the
stand,
but
we
couldn't
use
his
extrajudicial
declaration.
now,
that
is
not
the
third
circuit's
holding.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
might
try
to
impeach
him,
and
then
it
would
be
a
question
of
whether
it
could
come
in
as
substantive
evidence.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think,
justice
rehnquist's
question
does
reach
an
important
point.
what
does
it
mean,
what
does
the
third
circuit
mean
to
say
we
had
to
produce
lazaro?
if
it
simply
meant
we
had
to
bring
him
to
court
so
that
respondent
could
call
him
if
respondent
thought
he
had
valuable
testimony
to
give,
then
the
compulsory
process
clause
takes
care
of
that.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
suppose
that
is
possible.
the
judge
could
have
done
that
here,
too.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
oh,
i
understand
that
the
prosecution
could
call
him
if
it
wished
to
call
him.
the
defense
could
call
him
if
they
wished
to
call
him,
assuming
he
is
available.
if
he
is
unavailable,
the
declarations
come
in.
the
court
could
call
him.
nobody
saw
fit
to
call
lazaro.
nobody
had
any
interest
in
having
his
testimony.
nobody
perhaps
knew
what
he
was
going
to
say.
nobody
thought
he
would
make
a
credible
witness.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
am
sure
that
if
either
party
had
been
confident
that
the
testimony
would
have
been
helpful,
they
would
have
called
him
as
a
witness.
the
prosecution
in
fact
called
other
co-conspirators
as
witnesses
at
this
trial.
one
had
a
plea
bargain.
one
was
testifying
under
a
grant
of
immunity.
but
i
want
to
get
back
to
justice
rehnquist's
point.
if
all
we
have
to
do
is
produce
them
in
court,
then
it
seems
to
me
not
a
confrontation
clause
issue
at
all,
and
the
defendant's
right
to
compulsory
process
assures
his
production.
if
we
have
to
do
more,
what
is
it
that
we
are
going
to
do?
we
put
him
on
the
stand,
ask
him
his
name
and
address,
and
turn
him
over
for
cross
examination.
do
we
have
to
put
him
on
the
stand
and
ask
him
questions?
we
don't
want
his
evidence
in,
his
in
court
evidence.
the
defense
doesn't
want
his
in
court
evidence.
what
is
the
purpose
of
this
charade?
it
seems
to
me
it
will
simply
end
up
confusing
the
jury
without
serving
any
purpose.
now,
respondent
has
said
a
lot
about
the
importance
of
the
right
of
cross
examination,
and
i
don't
mean
to
speak
against
the
value
of
cross
examination
at
all.
it
clearly
is
very
important.
but
respondent
has
not
explained
why
that
right
of
cross
examination
is
not
protected
by
rule
806
of
the
rules
of
evidence
which
allowed
respondent
to
call
lazaro
as
a
witness
and
cross
examine
him.
it
specifically
says
in
the
case
of
hearsay
declarants,
you
can
do
that.
so
i
don't
think
the
problem
was
an
inability
to
cross
examine
lazaro.
the
problem
was
a
desire
to
jerk
the
prosecution
around,
which
is
essentially
what
has
happened
here.
now,
the
fact
is
that
if
the
co-conspirator
declarant
is
not
already
being
called
by
one
party
or
the
other
as
a
witness,
it
is
probably
because
he
is
in
fact
unavailable,
or
is
judged
not
to
be
a
desirable
source
of
evidence,
and
what
the
third
circuit's
rule
requires
is
that
prosecutors
produce
or
show
the
unavailability
of
every
co-conspirator
declarant
even
though
it
produced
virtually
none
of
these
would
be
called
to
testify.
now,
does
that
rule
make
any
sense
at
all?
now,
let
me
turn
to
the
cost
side,
because
justice
o'connor
did
ask
that
question.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
that
was
defendant's
choice,
not
to
call
lazaro
and
have
him
examined.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
have
the
benefit
of--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--no,
we
put
the
evidence
in.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
we
put
the
evidence--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
don't
agree
that
the
other
side
could
not...
if...
i
am
not
sure
what
the
purpose
of
cross...
they
could
cross
examine
the
witness
through
whom
we
put
on
the
evidence,
that
is,
to
determine
whether
the
declaration
was
made
and
what
the
circumstances
of
it
were.
in
this
case
it
was
a
recording,
but
they
could
determine
how
the
recording
was
made,
that
it
wasn't
tampered
wit,
and
all
these
other
things.
at
that
point
the
evidence
speaks
for
itself.
now
it
is
true
that
lazaro
might
have
something
to
say
that
would
contradict
the
tendency
of
the
evidence
or
that
would
explain
the
evidence
in
a
way
that
is
favorable
to
the
defendant.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
that
depends
on
how
good
the
cross
examiner
is,
i
suppose.
well,
let
me
turn
to
the
question
of
costs,
and
again,
i
think
you
have
to
remember
that
the
witnesses
who
we
are
talking
about
or
the
potential
witnesses
who
we
are
talking
about
are
usually
not
cooperative
individuals
or
they
wouldn't
be
prosecution
witnesses
in
the
first
place.
many
of
them
may
be
in
the
defense
camp
or
sympathetic
with
the
defendant.
they
may
be
afraid
of
the
defendant.
they
are
not
people
who
are
totally
within
our
control.
now,
we
have
to
produce
these
people.
suppose
that
is
the
rule.
well,
first
of
all,
some
of
the
people,
we
will
know
who
they
are,
and
we
will
know
where
they
can
be
found.
that
is
not
always
the
case,
but
if
that
is
the
case,
as
it
was
the
case
here,
production
may
be
relatively
easy
in
many
instances,
plus,
as
we
have
pointed
out,
particularly
since
these
are
co-conspirators,
a
lot
of
them
will
be
in
jail,
and
producing
then
will
be
quite
a
costly
and
burdensome
exercise.
but
even
if
they
are
not
in
jail,
we
can
subpoena
them,
as
indeed
we
did
in
this
case,
and
we
may
find
that
they
have
gone
fishing,
or
that
they
had
car
trouble,
or
that
they
are
sick,
and
they
may
not
appear
in
response
to
the
subpoena.
well,
then
what
is
to
happen?
is
the
judge
to
stop
the
trial
while
a
search
goes
on
for
this
declarant?
you
know,
again,
maybe
this
is
worthwhile
if
this
is
a
witness
who
is
actually
going
to
be
called
upon
by
somebody
to
give
testimony
at
trial,
but
we
are
talking
about
somebody
who
is
to
be
trotted
into
the
courtroom,
who
nobody
wants
as
a
witness
of
their
own,
so
it
is
an
awful
lot
of
trouble
for
somebody
who
the
parties
don't
want
as
a
witness.
and
then,
even
worse,
what
happens
if
we
have
trouble
identifying
who
the
declarant
is,
or
if
we
have
difficulty
in
locating
a
declarant
who
may
have
made
a
declaration
five
years
ago
that
we
want
to
introduce.
we
may
not
know
where
he
is,
how
far
do
we
have
to
go
to
locate
him.
we
are
going
to
have
litigation,
and
this
is
the
final
point
that
i
want
to
make,
is
the
effect
on
the
courts
of
all
of
this.
the
effect
of
the
courts
on
the
unavailability
requirement
to
date
has
been
slight
because
the
number
of
instances
of
using
prior
testimony
are
relatively
few.
the
number
of
instances
of
using
co-conspirator
declarations
are
many,
and
if
you
just
sit
back
for
a
minute
and
think
that
every
time
the
prosecution
wants
to
use
a
co-conspirator
declaration,
they
will
have
to
produce
or
demonstrate
the
unavailability
of
the
declarant.
if
they
fail
to
produce
him,
there
will
be
litigation,
endless
litigation
about
whether
they
are
culpable,
about
whether
he
is
really
unavailable.
this
will
be
a
burden
on
the
trial
courts.
it
will
be
a
burden
on
the
appellate
courts.
i
think
there
has
been
no
showing
of
any
justification
for
such
a
burden.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
i
do.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
am
not
sure.
i
have
never
actually
prosecuted
the
case
at
the
trial
level,
but
presumably
there
has
been
a
grand
jury,
and
we
know
what
some
of
the
witnesses
are
going
to
say
from
that
testimony.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
but
in
his
statement
in
any
event
because
his
statement
has
independent
evidentiary
value.
now,
what
else
i
would
do
would
depend
on
whether
what
i
learned
was
ready
material,
in
which
case
i
would
turn
it
over
to
the
defense.
if
all
i
learned
was
that
he
was
going
to
be
a
lousy
witness
at
trial,
i
would
simply
not
use
him,
and
neither
would
they.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
absolutely,
and
the
statement
has
independent
value
from
whatever
he
might
say
at
trial.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
my
conceptual
approach
is
a
lot
like
it,
but
not
identical
to
it.
let
me
say
this.
first
of
all,
i
do
not
concede
that
lazaro
is
the
government's
witness,
because
we
introduced
statements
made
during
the
course
of
the
conspiracy.
it
seems
to
me
the
point
that
i
am
trying
to
make
is
that
a
witness
is
somebody
who
has
made
a
statement
of
a
testimonial
character,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
a
declaration
of
a
co-conspirator
in
the
course
of
a
conspiracy
is
not
testimony.
it
is
an
event
that
is
occurring
in
the
course
of
the
conspiracy.
it
is
quite
different
from
the
statement,
and
justice
harlan
had
a
little
difficulty
dealing
with
dutton
and...
dutton
particularly
because
of
how
you
deal
with
an
accomplice's
confession.
now,
i
would
say
that
an
accomplice's
confession
is
testimonial,
and
makes
him
a
witness
if
it
used.
now,
it
may
be
able
to
be
used
under
the
confrontation
clause
anyway,
or
it
may
not,
depending
on
confrontation
clause
rules,
but
i
think
that
my
approach
of
asking
whether
the
out
of
court
declaration
is
testimonial
in
character
and
therefore
makes
him
a
witness
within
the
meaning
of
the
sixth
amendment
is
different
from
justice
harlan's
approach,
and
i
think
it
should
commend
itself...
i
hope
it
would
commend
itself
to
the
court.
let
me
get
back
to
dutton
against
evans.
justice
rehnquist
asked
about
that.
first
of
all,
the
statement
of
dutton
was
clearly
inadmissible
under
evidence
law.
it
was
gotten
in
in
a
totally
improper
way.
it
has
been
said
by
the
advisory
committee
that
the...
excuse
me,
douglas
against
alabama
i
am
referring
to
now.
it
has
been
said
by
the
advisory
committee
that
that
was
really
a
case
that
was
largely
concerned
with
prosecutorial
misconduct.
when
we
come
to
dutton,
which
is
a
co-conspirator
declaration
not
within
the
traditional
rule,
i
would
like
to
read
what
the
court
said
about
the
traditional
co-conspirator
declaration.
this
is
at
page
80
of
400
us.
"the
argument
seems
to
be
rather
that
in
any
given
case
the
constitution
requires
a
reappraisal
of
every
exception
to
the
hearsay
rule
no
matter
how
long
established
in
order
to
determine
whether,
in
the
words
of
the
court
of
appeals,
it
is
supported
by
salient
and
cogent
reasons.
"
"the
logic
of
that
position
would
seem
to
require
a
constitutional
reassessment
of
every
established
hearsay
exception,
federal
or
state,
but
in
the
present
case
it
is
argued
only
that
the
hearsay
exception
applied
by
georgia
is
constitutionally
invalid
because
it
doesn't
conform
to
the
federal
hearsay
exception.
"
"appellee
does
not
challenge
and
we
do
not
question
the
validity
of
the
co-conspirator
exception
applied
in
the
federal
courts.
"
and
in
ohio
against
roberts,
i
think
the
court
again
suggested
that
the
traditional
co-conspirator
exception
was
not
being
called
into
question.
now,
as
far
as
what
the
government
said
or
didn't
say
at
trial.
i
believe
at
the
time
of
trial
there
was
a
third
circuit
decision
called
gibbs,
a
panel
decision
later
overruled
en
banc
that
did
require
us
to
produce
or
show
the
unavailability
of
a
witness.
as
far
as
what
respondent's
position
was
at
trial,
if
you
look
at
page
17
of
the
appendix,
you
will
see
that
they
thought
unavailability
was
a
condition
of
admission
and
production
would
not
do
to
get
the
statement
in.
