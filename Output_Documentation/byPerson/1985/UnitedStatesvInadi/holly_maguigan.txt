ms.
holly
maguigan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
government's
argument
to
you
this
afternoon,
like
the
brief
and
reply
brief
which
they
submitted,
overlooks
a
crucial
fact.
while
they
concede
that
they
used
the
evidence
of
john
lazaro,
they
don't
speak
directly
to
the
fact
that
by
doing
so
they
made
him
their
witness
against
the
respondent.
they
do
not
dispute
the
finding
in
the
circuit
court
that
the
five
tape
recorded
conversations
on
which
john
lazaro
spoke
on
four
were
the
lynchpins,
the
heart
and
soul
of
the
prosecution's
case.
those
conversations
contained
narratives
of
past
historical
fact.
they
were
offered
for
the
truth
of
the
matter
asserted.
the
jury
was
invited
to
rely
on
them
and
to
base
its
verdict
on
them.
in
fact,
with
regard
to
one
of
those
tapes,
the
one
that
mr.
frey
referred
to
as
between
mr.
lazaro
and
one
william
laven,
the
jury
after
a
full
day
of
deliberation
asked
to
hear
that
tape
again,
and
that
one
is
replete
with
recitations
of
past
historical
fact
uncross
examined.
it
cannot
be
denied
that
the
evidence
of
john
lazaro,
made
a
witness
against
us
by
the
government,
was
crucial
and
devastating.
ms.
holly
maguigan
at
a
minimum,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
would
have
been
to
highlight
the
fact
that
in
the
tape
recorded
conversations,
john
lazaro
made
representations
of
fact
which
were
belied
by
evidence
in
the
government's
own
case
by
the
witnesses
they
did
elect
to
call,
and
i
would
submit
to
you
that
one
of
the
reasons
the
government
was
interested
in
insulating
mr.
lazaro
from
cross
examination
was,
they
wanted
those
assertions
of
fact
to
go
untested
by
cross
examination.
ms.
holly
maguigan
it
would
not,
justice,
have
cured
the
harm
to
us
from
the
denial
of
confrontation
in
their
case.
the
government
said--
ms.
holly
maguigan
--well,
it
is
because
the
reason,
the
reason
that
it
is
so
important
that
a
person
accused
of
crime
get
to
cross
examine
the
government's
witness
is,
one,
that
it
is
clear
he
is
in
fact
the
government's
witness,
and
two,
it
is
in
the
context
of
his
being
the
government's
witness
that
he
is
compelled
to
stand
face
to
face
with
the
jury,
compelled
to
answer
questions.
ms.
holly
maguigan
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
that
he
was
in
fact
adverse
to
them,
your
honor.
it
may
be
that...
but
the
record
doesn't
support
that.
ms.
holly
maguigan
i
would
say
no,
not
always,
because
very
often,
as
in
this
case,
the
two
co-conspirators
whom
the
government
did
elect
to
use
and
subject
to
cross
examination
were
not
called
as
adverse
witnesses,
were
not
examined
as
on
cross
examination.
ms.
holly
maguigan
that
doesn't
mean
they
couldn't
be.
ms.
holly
maguigan
i
think
really
what
it
boils
down
to
in
a
way,
your
honor,
is
that
the
government
and
the
respondent
agree
on
one
thing.
what
mr.
frey's
argument
suggested
in
their
analysis
at
page
43
of
their
brief
suggested
also
is
that
john
lazaro
is
a
loose
cannon.
they
don't
want
to
take
the
risk
of
putting
him
on.
they
want
to
put
that
risk
on
us.
ms.
holly
maguigan
the
recordings,
sir,
would
have
gone
in
in
our
view
of
801
as
an
evidentiary
matter
whether
he
was
present
or
not.
the
implication
for
the
confrontation
clause
analysis
is
whether
there
was
an
excuse
for
their
failure
to
produce
him,
but
i
think
to
answer
your
question--
ms.
holly
maguigan
--if
they
had
as
a
confrontation
clause
analysis...
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
confrontation
clause,
the
issue
is
whether
the
government
is
excused
by
the
necessities
of
the
case
from
producing
him
for
cross
examination,
but
as
a
matter
of
evidentiary
law--
ms.
holly
maguigan
--in
my
view,
sir,
that
would
not
have
been
sufficient,
but
it
is
important
to
note
that
they
did
not
even
that
minimum--
ms.
holly
maguigan
--because
if
they
force
us
to
put
him
on
in
our
case,
assuming
they
in
fact
bring
him
to
the
courtroom
and
say,
we
are
not
going
to
use
him,
here
he
is,
which
they
didn't
do,
but
assuming
that,
the
difficulty
is,
if
we
put
him
on
in
our
case,
we
are
seen
especially
in
a
conspiracy
trial
as
somehow
validating
the
government's
allegation,
and
it
is
only
an
allegation,
that
the
ultimate
jury
question
has
been
resolved.
we
are
forced
to
call
him.
they
say
we
are
in
league
with
him.
ms.
holly
maguigan
i
don't
think
i
understand
your
question.
ms.
holly
maguigan
what
i
say
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
confrontation
clause
is--
ms.
holly
maguigan
--i
am
afraid
i
can't,
because
i
don't
know
whether
you
are
asking
me
to
assume
that
they
simply
have
him
at
the
table
but
they
don't
call
him.
is
that
the
idea?
ms.
holly
maguigan
it
is
my
view,
sir,
that
unless
they
put
him
on
in
their
case
as
a
witness
and
subject
to
cross
during
their
case,
they
cannot
use
the
tape
recordings.
however,
it
should
be
made
clear
that
they
did
not
do
what
you
suggest
here
in
your
hypothetical
situation.
they
never
turned
to
us
and
say,
we
have
got
john
lazaro,
we
are
not
going
to
use
him,
you
can
have
him,
so
that
we
are
not
faced
with
that
issue
of
what
the
confrontation
clause
compels.
this
court
has
held
that
the
right
of
cross
examination
is
an
essential
feature
of
confrontation,
that
physical
production
may
not
be
enough
in
all
cases,
but
it
should
be
clear
here
that
the
physical
production
aspect
of
confrontation--
ms.
holly
maguigan
--not
at
all.
not
at
all.
ms.
holly
maguigan
they
could,
for
instance,
say
what
is
your
name,
have
you
listened
to
these
tapes,
are
you
the
john
lazaro
speaking
on
these
tapes?
that
is
it.
if
they
don't
want
anything
else
from
him,
that
is
all
they
need
to
do.
ms.
holly
maguigan
well,
they
can
also
impeach
him
if
he
says
no.
ms.
holly
maguigan
then
i
am
going
to
cross
examine
him.
ms.
holly
maguigan
about
the
fact
that
what
he
says
on
the
tapes
is
inconsistent
with
what
live
witnesses
say,
about
the
fact
that
there
are
internal
inconsistencies
between
his
recitations
of
past
historical
fact
offered
for
the
truth
of
the
matter
asserted.
i
am
going
to
talk
about
his
interest
and
his
bias
in
the
case.
i
am
going
to
ask
him
about
the
code
he
used.
ms.
holly
maguigan
well,
there
is
a
difficulty
with
having
him--
ms.
holly
maguigan
--he
wasn't
there
when
the
government
rested,
but
there
is
a
difficulty.
one
is--
ms.
holly
maguigan
--no,
we
didn't.
we
didn't.
we
had
heard
all
along
that
he
was
under
subpoena
by
the
government.
ms.
holly
maguigan
yes,
then
that
his
car
had
broken
down,
although
the
government
never
asked
for
a
bench
warrant,
never
asked
for
a
recess.
in
fact,
the
case
carried
over
that
day.
that
was
a
friday.
carried
over
into
the
following
monday,
when
they
rested.
we
immediately
renewed
our
objection.
they
never
asked
leave
to
reopen.
to
answer
the
question--
ms.
holly
maguigan
--it
wasn't
our
subpoena.
the
judge
could
have
asked
for
a
bench
warrant.
the
practice
in
the
eastern
district
is
not
that
the
defense
lawyer
asks
for
a
bench
warrant
on
the
government's
subpoena.
the
government
could
ask
for
it
or
the
court
could
issue
it.
ms.
holly
maguigan
it
is
not
the
practice.
what
we
did
was
object
repeatedly
to
the
fact
that
he
wasn't
called.
ms.
holly
maguigan
well,
we
could
have
gotten
a
subpoena.
we
had
no
address
for
him.
one
assumes
we
could
have
gotten
a
subpoena,
but
if
we
had
called
him,
at
least
arguably
we
would
not
have
been
entitled
to
the
jencks
act
material.
the
statute
by
its
terms
says
after
a
witness
has
testified
for
the
government
on
direct,
they
would
get
to
cross
examine
him
as
a
matter
of
right
if
we
had
called
him,
whereas
it
is
not
clear
they
could
qualify
him
as
an
adverse
witness.
it
is
our
view
that
they
used
him
also.
to
the
extent
he
is
a
loose
cannon,
to
the--
ms.
holly
maguigan
--that's
right,
they
took
no
responsibility
for
him.
if
they
don't
want
to
use
him,
they
shouldn't
put
on
his
statements
totally
insulated
from
cross
examination.
ms.
holly
maguigan
that
is
up
to
them.
ms.
holly
maguigan
they
could
do
that,
yes.
ms.
holly
maguigan
it
would
be
the--
ms.
holly
maguigan
--i
would
be
confined
in
my
view,
given
that
they
made
him
a
witness
through
the
tapes
to
the
tapes
and
to
anything
he
says
on
his
direct
testimony.
certainly
the
scope
of
my
cross
would
extend
to
what
he
said
on
the
tape
recorded
conversations.
ms.
holly
maguigan
certainly.
ms.
holly
maguigan
that's
right.
you
would
ask
him
the
traditional
question
that
would
be
asked
of
cross
examination.
one
of
the
issues
that
has
been
raised
by
the
government
that
really
is
inappropriately
put
to
you
here
is
whether
the
information
john
lazaro
would
have
given
was
in
our
view
material
testimony
favorable
to
the
defense.
that
is,
of
course,
not
the
issue.
that
would
be
the
issue
were
this
a
compulsory
process
case,
and
i
would
submit
that
if
i
wanted
to
ask
him
questions
outside
the
scope
of
appropriate
direct,
including
the
tapes,
it
might
well
be
a
case
properly
analyzed
under
compulsory
process,
but
our
view
was
not
that
he
was
a
witness
with
material
testimony
favorable.
he
was
not
a
witness
in
our
favor.
he
was
a
witness
used
by
them
against
us.
and
this
court
has
never
held
that
the
existence
of
compulsory
process
rights
can
somehow
serve
as
an
antidote
to
denial
of
confrontation
opportunities.
if
that
were
the
case--
ms.
holly
maguigan
--no.
ms.
holly
maguigan
many
of
them
are.
and
in
fact
i
think
to
be
fair
some
of
the
exchanges
in
the
tapes
here
could
be
characterized
in
that
fashion.
there
is,
of
course,
a
crucial
distinction.
in
the
kinds
of
exchanges
that
you
just
hypothesized,
you
are
in
a
situation
which
mr.
frey
discussed
during
his
argument
where
the
statements
come
in
at
least
for
their
non-hearsay
purposes.
they
come
in
to
show
the
conspiracy
as
alleged,
speaking
to
its
alleged
members.
it
is
crucial
that
in
this
case
there
were
narratives
of
past
fact
because
it
was
the
truth
of
those
historical
narratives
that
the
jury
based
its
verdict
on.
it
was
absolutely
crucial.
it
is
important
to
bear
in
mind
with
co-conspirator
declarations
that
they
come
in
not
because
of
any
judgment
that
narrations
of
past
fact
are
in
fact
reliable,
or
that
they
themselves
are
reliable.
the
advisory
committee
notes
make
clear
as
of
circuit
courts
and
scholars
that
they
come
in
because
of
a
fiction,
the
notion
that
one
co-conspirator
is
in
fact
the
authorized
agent
to
speak
for
another.
they
are
often
fraught
with
deliberate
falsehood.
they
are
often
declarations
made
by
people
with
really
serious
motives
to
lie,
and
statements
of
deliberate
falsehood
come
in
for
the
truth
of
the
matter
asserted.
in
fact,
in
this
case
the
trial
judge
ruled
specifically
that
they
would
come
in
whether
they
were
true
or
not.
ms.
holly
maguigan
that
certainly
is
the
fiction,
and
as
a
matter
of
the
law
of
evidence,
that
is
true.
the
reason
why
they
are
exempt
from
the
prohibition
against
hearsay
is
that
notion,
and
it
is
extended
from
admissions
of
a
party
himself
through
agents
and
servants
to
its
final
most
attenuated
version,
which
is
co-conspirator
declarations,
recognizing--
ms.
holly
maguigan
--what
i
mean,
sir,
is,
as
an
issue
under
the
rules
of
evidence,
that
is
the
reason
why
it
is
not
barred.
as
an
issue
to
be
examined
under
the
confrontation
clause,
it
is
not
dispositive.
ms.
holly
maguigan
they
are
not
the
same.
with
regard
to
the
rule...
the
sorts
of
exceptions
codified
at
rule
803,
the
confrontation
clause
and
the
exceptions
to
the
hearsay
rule
and
the
hearsay
bar
itself
often
have
the
same
roots,
but
this
court
has
recognized
on
many
occasions
that
evidence
which
may
come
in
as
an
exception
to
the
prohibition
against
hearsay
may
violate
the
confrontation
clause
if
it
is
brought
in
and
the
witness
who
is
the
declarant
is
not
produced
for
cross
examination.
ms.
holly
maguigan
well,
it
is
true
that
many
of
those
cases
are
prior
recorded
testimony
and
dying
declarations
cases,
but
this
court
has
considered
that
issue
in
other
contexts.
ms.
holly
maguigan
yes,
confessions,
declarations
against
interest,
declarations
against--
ms.
holly
maguigan
--yes.
ms.
holly
maguigan
for
instance,
in
douglas.
in
this
court,
has
this
court
ever
held...
i
don't
know
of
others.
the
main
situation
that
has
presented
itself
to
this
court
has
been
confessions
and
prior
recorded
testimony
and
dying
declarations.
however,
this
court
has
also
been
clear
not
to
say
that
well
recognized
hearsay
exceptions
are
immune
from
constitution
clause
scrutiny,
and
certainly
has
rejected
opportunities
to
say
that
the
co-conspirator
exemption
is
immune
from
confrontation
clause
scrutiny
because
of
the
fiction
of
agency.
that
could
have
been
the
basis
for
the
ruling
in
button,
and
it
was
not.
this
court
carefully
considered
the
application
of
the
confrontation
clause,
in
that
case
decided
that
the
confrontation
clause
had
not
been
offended--
ms.
holly
maguigan
--it
was,
but
both
the
plurality
and
the
concurring
authors
concluded
that
in
dutton
there
was
a
confrontation
clause
issue,
and
that
it
would
be
resolved
by
assessing
the
utility
of
trial
confrontations.
it
was
not
a
case
whether
either
the
plurality
or
the
concurring
opinion
said
we
are
going
to
now
say
that
the
co-conspirator
declarations
are
immune
forever
from
this
sort
of
scrutiny.
ms.
holly
maguigan
because
it
was
held
to
have
been
of
peripheral
significance
at
most
and
not
crucial
and
devastating.
in
dutton
the
hearsay
declaration,
the
co-conspirator
declaration
was
offered
by
one
of
20
witnesses
and
was
corroborative
and
simply
cumulative,
and
the
analysis
was
whether
trial
confrontation
would
have
advanced
the
truthseeking
process,
which
is
the
mission
of
the
confrontation
clause,
and
the
conclusion
was,
although
for
different
seasons,
between
the
plurality
and
the
concurring
opinion,
that
trial
confrontation
would
not
have
advanced
the
truthseeking
process.
but
there
was
there
clearly
a
sense
of
the
interplay
between
the
right
of
confrontation
and
the
understood
admissibility
of
co-conspirator
declarations.
ms.
holly
maguigan
we
referred
to
the
fact
that
there
were
historical
narratives
of
past
fact.
whether
we
did
it
as
forcefully
as
i
have
done
it
today,
i
don't
know,
justice.
ms.
holly
maguigan
yes,
oh,
absolutely,
we
did.
and
one
of
the
reasons
that
we
made
it
so
consistently
was
what
i
said,
that
there
were
internal
inconsistencies,
and
inconsistencies
between
what
lazaro
said
on
the
tape
and
what
the
government
witnesses
said
on
cross
examination.
the
government,
however,
took
a
different
view
below
from
the
view
it
takes
now
for
why
it
should
be
excused
from
the
unavailability
requirement.
in
the
court
below,
the
government
said
we
don't
think
we
should
be
required
to
show
unavailability,
but
we
will.
they
never
claimed
a
burden.
they
never
claimed
that
this
witness
would
take
the
fifth
amendment
as
an
excuse
not
to
make
himself
available.
they
speculated
that
he
would
go
to
contempt
and
violate
his
parole
if
he
were
called
to
testify.
but
the
judge
said
to
them,
bring
him
in.
and
he
said
to
them
specifically,
you
are
better
off
putting
on
your
evidence
now
then
you
are
having
to
litigate
it
later.
now,
it
is
true,
as
mr.
frey
pointed
out,
that
at
one
point
the
trial
judge
asked
me
to
consult
with
my
client
about
whenever
we
were
willing
to
waive
our
objection.
we
did,
and
it
is
clear
40
pages
later
that
we
renewed
the
objection
and
insisted
that
he
had
to
be
produced.
at
no
time
fit
they
say
this
is
a
hardship.
there
is
no
record
before
you
to
assess
their
scary
predictions
about
hardship.
at
no
time
did
they
say
he
could
take
the
fifth.
and
in
fact
that
is
speculation
which
may
be
belied
by
the
record.
the
u.s.
attorney
who
tried
the
case
said
he
has
no
claim
of
the
fifth.
ms.
holly
maguigan
i
don't
believe
i
would
have
been
allowed
to
cross
examine,
mr.
chief
justice.
he
would
have
been
unavailable.
ms.
holly
maguigan
he
would
have
been
unavailable
if
he
had
come
in
and
taken
the
fifth,
assuming
the
judge
sustained
his
claim
of
the
fifth.
the
judge
may
well--
ms.
holly
maguigan
--i
could
test
his
fifth
amendment
claim.
that
is
right.
i
thought
you
meant
could
i
cross
examine
him
on
the
merits.
ms.
holly
maguigan
if
he
persists
in
his
assertion
of
the
fifth
and
the
judge
upholds
it,
i
have
to
live
with
that.
that
is
a
reality
with
which
people
who
represent
people
accused
of
crime
have
to
live.
what
the
sixth
amendment
guarantees
is
a
fair
trial,
and
a
fair
trial
is
one
where
you
get
to
cross
examine
those
people
whom
the
government
decides
to
use
as
witnesses
against
you.
sometimes
they
are
excused
by
the
necessities
of
the
case.
the
government
suggested
in
their
brief
at
page
27,
their
original
brief,
that
somehow
ohio
versus
roberts
didn't
mean
what
it
said,
or
on
the
other
hand
was
an
offhand
embrace
of
a
revolutionary
proposition.
i
submit
to
you
that
the
roberts
court
meant
what
it
said,
and
that
it
was
faithful
to
this
court's
earlier
decisions.
the
roberts
court
by
its
terms
says
this
case
presents
us
with
yet
another
instance
in
which
we
must
review
the
relationship
between
the
confrontation
clause
and
the
hearsay
bar
and
its
many
exceptions.
those
exceptions
were
in
the
body
of
the
court's
opinion
beyond
the
exception
for
prior
recorded
testimony.
it
is
true
that
the
facts
of
that
case
included
prior
reported
testimony,
but
it
is
also
true
that
the
majority
opinion
there
referred
to
the
usual
case
and
then
didn't
say
in
the
usual
case
of
prior
testimony,
or
in
the
usual
case
where
there
has
been
confrontation,
but
said,
in
the
usual
case,
including
those
where
there
has
been
prior
confrontation.
ms.
holly
maguigan
that
is
right.
i
believe
to
the
extent
that
co-conspirator
declarations
are
different
from
prior
recorded
testimony,
they
are
less
reliable.
at
least
with
prior
recorded
testimony
you
have
a
declaration
under
oath
in
a
judicial
setting
in
the
presence
of
a
defendant
and
his
attorney
and
subject
to
cross
examination.
with
co-conspirator
declarations,
they
are
not
in
the
judicial
setting.
they
are
not
under
oath.
they
may
be
in
the
presence
of
the
defendant,
but
as
this
case
demonstrates,
they
need
not
be,
and
they
are
never
subject
to
cross
examination.
there
is
no
logical
reason
which
compels
the
conclusion
that
a
person
having
to
answer
to
co-conspirator
declarations
should
have
less
protection
of
his
confrontation
rights
than
a
person
called
to
answer
to
accusations
in
prior
testimony.
ms.
holly
maguigan
well,
i
might.
i
don't
expect
i
would
be
real
sanguine
about
it.
ms.
holly
maguigan
no,
justice,
we
are
not,
and
what
is
made
clear
in
the
advisory
committee
notes
and
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
is
that
the
hearsay
rules
do
not
require
admission
of
those
statements
that
are
exceptions.
they
are
written
in
such
a
way
as
to
say
the
bar
against
hearsay
is
not
a
bar
in
these
cases.
the
advisory
committee
notes
make
very
clear
that
when
the
authors
wrote
those
rules,
they
expected
that
there
might
well
be
times
that
evidence
which
was
not
barred
by
the
rules
might
be
barred
by
the
confrontation
clause.
this
case
does
not
present
a
question
of
your
finding
that
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
are
unconstitutional.
ms.
holly
maguigan
to
this
day
under
the
hearsay
rules.
in
a
criminal
case
you
may
have
evidence
not
barred
because
of
the
operation
of
the
hearsay
rules,
and
the
question
is,
does
the
confrontation
clause
require
a
different
result.
that
is
really
the
question.
the
confrontation
clause
inquiry
is
a
separate
inquiry.
ms.
holly
maguigan
with
regard
to
hearsay,
yes,
sir.
not
with
regard
to
co-conspirator
declarations.
with
regard
to
hearsay,
they
stem
from
the
same
general
principle,
which
is
to
advance
the
truthseeking
process
in
trial.
that
is
absolutely
true.
and
the
exceptions
now
codified
in
our
system
in
rule
803
are
based
on
judgements
about
trustworthiness,
about
situations
in
which
people
can
be
expected
to
be
reliable
in
their
assertions.
that
is
not
the
basis
of
the
judgments
about
co-conspirator
declarations.
ms.
holly
maguigan
no.
ms.
holly
maguigan
those
are
the
same
party.
there
is
absolute
identity
of
party
there.
ms.
holly
maguigan
the
defendant's
agent
is
a
slightly
different
situation
when
you
have
a
clear
agency
as
a
matter
of
fact,
a
literal
agency.
i
believe
for
instance
with
a
corporation
and
employees
you
have
a
factual
agency,
whereas
in
co-conspirator
cases
what
you
have
is
an
agency
which
may
be
only
a
fiction,
which
the
government
need
establish
by
independent
evidence
before
using
then
tapes
only
by
a
preponderance
with
a
standard
that
varies
quite
widely
circuit
to
circuit.
in
the
sixth
circuit,
for
instance,
they
can
use
the
tapes
themselves
to
meet
the
threshold
preponderant
showing
that
there
is
that
relationship.
ms.
holly
maguigan
that
is
the
fiction,
mr.
chief
justice.
ms.
holly
maguigan
yes,
sir,
and
it
is
reflected
in
the
advisory
committee
notes
and
in
circuit
court
opinions.
and
that
is
why
it
is
so
important
that
the
government
standard
is
only
by
a
preponderance.
it
is
worthy,
i
think,
of
note
in
this
case
that
with
regard
to
co-conspirator
declarations,
this
court
has
spoken
relatively
recently
in
dutton
versus
evans.
delaney
is
not
dispositive.
in
delaney
the
declarant
was
dead.
the
court
analyzed
the
co-conspirator
exception
in
two
sentences,
and
in
one
of
the
sentences
it
was
that
the
declarant
was
not
available
to
the
court.
but
in
dutton
you
have
an
alternative
basis
for
upholding
the
court
of
appeals
even
were
you
to
rule
that
they
were
wrong
in
the
application
of
ohio
against
roberts.
now,
i
do
not
believe
that
you
will
come
to
the
conclusion
that
they
were
wrong,
but
it
is
important
to
note
that
this
court
has
precedent
in
its
own
decisions
for
assessing
the
relationship
of
the
confrontation
clause
and
co-conspirator
declarations.
and
dutton
applied
to
this
case
would
require
a
determination
that
the
court
of
appeals
judgment
should
be
upheld,
because
in
this
case,
unlike
dutton,
the
evidence
adduced
by
the
government,
insulated
from
cross
examination,
was
crucial
and
devastating.
the
government
has
never
contended
that
the
utility
of
trial
confrontation
would
have
been
remote.
the
evidence
was
not
of
peripheral
significance.
he
was
their
witness.
we
should
have
been
able
to
cross
examine
him.
