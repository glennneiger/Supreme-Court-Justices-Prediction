justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
in
effect
that
if
the
declaration
of
an
adverse
party
can
be
admitted
against
in
open
court,
the
declaration
of
an
adverse
party
can
be
admitted
on
the
same
principal?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--is
it
your
understanding
of
respondent's
position
that
if
lazaro
had
been
available,
the
u.s.
attorney
would
have
had
to
call
him
to
the
stand
and
put
the
declaration
to
him
in
kind
of
a
cross
examination?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
would
then
have
to
just
treat
him
as
a
normal
witness?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
ms.
maguigan,
just
how
would
this
have
proceeded
in
the
trial
court
if
the
government
had
produced
lazaro
if
that's
his
name?
could
they
simply
have
announced,
here
he
is
at
counsel
table,
and
then
the
recordings
go
in?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
would
have
gone
in
whether
he
was
present
or
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
on
your
view
of
what
the
law
ought
to
be...
i
take
it
you
are
supporting
the
opinion
of
the
third
circuit...
what
if
the
government
in
this
case
had
said
here
at
counsel
table
is
mr.
lazaro.
we
now
offer
in
evidence
exhibits
a,
b,
and
c,
which
are
the
tape
recordings
or
cassettes
of
his
co-conspirator
declaration.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
would
it
not
have
been
sufficient?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
what
does
happen
under
your
hypothesis
if
the
government
says
here
is
mr.
lazaro
and
we
offer
exhibits
a,
b,
and
c?
does
the
district
court
exclude
those
exhibits,
the
cassettes?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so
they
bring
mr.
lazaro
into
court
and
say,
here
he
is,
and
now
they
still
want
to
offer
the
cassettes
in
evidence.
do
you
say
they
simply
can't
come
in
because
he
is
not
unavailable?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
mean...
can
you
answer
my
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
have
him
at
the
table.
they
don't
call
him.
they
simply
offer
what
they
offered
in
the
district
court,
the
cassettes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
that
is
quite
consistent
with
the
general
rule
on
hearsay,
isn't
it,
that
the
declarations
of
an
adverse
party
can
be
offered
on
the
theory
that
it
is
rather
likely
that
an
adverse
party
isn't
going
to
help
himself
unnecessarily,
or
rather
that
he
is
not
going
to
hurt
himself
unnecessarily.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
say
it
is
true
as
a
matter
of
law
of
evidence.
under
what
kind
of
law
is
it
not
true?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
the
confrontation
clause
part
of
the
body
of
rules
of
evidence?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
that
mostly
in
cases
of
prior
recorded
testimony?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
has
it
ever
held
that
something
that
wasn't
prior
recorded
testimony
couldn't
come
in
because
of
the
confrontation
clause
even
though
it
was
acceptable
under
the
rules
of
evidence?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
confessions
in
a
criminal
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
anything
else?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
dutton
was
a
plurality
opinion.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
but
the
ultimate
holding
in
dutton
was
that
the
evidence
had
been
properly
admitted.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
in
your
brief
you
also
advanced
what
is
perhaps
a
little
narrower
around
than
you
are
advancing
now,
that
even
if
the
government
is
right
that
the
actual
holdings
of
these
prior
cases
have
been
generally
prior
recorded
testimony,
co-conspirator
declarations
should
be
analyzed
the
same
way
as
prior
recorded
testimony,
and
you
don't
have
to
call
into
question
any
of
the
other
exceptions
to
the
hearsay
rule
under
the
confrontation
clause.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--except
they
really
stem
from
the
same
general
principles,
don't
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
challenge
the
basis
for
admitting,
say,
a
defendant's
out
of
court
statements
against
him?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
those
are
sufficiently
reliable
or--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--how
about
the
defendant's
agent?
