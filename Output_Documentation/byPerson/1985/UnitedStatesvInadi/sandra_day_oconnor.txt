i
am
curious,
mr.
frey.
you
talk
about
the
tremendous
significance
of
the
issue.
as
i
understand
it,
several
states
have
determined
as
a
matter
of
state
constitutional
law
to
require
the
enforcement
of
proof
of
unavailability
and
reliability
to
produce
evidence
such
as
this
in
a
co-conspirator
situation.
has
the
experience
of
those
states
been
such
that
law
enforcement
agencies
have
been
hampered
in
their--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--would
it
depend
in
part
on
how
strictly
one
has
to
prove
unavailability?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
it
make
any
difference
at
all
that
the
rule
treats
co-conspirator
statements
as
exempt
from
being
hearsay,
and
the
other
rules
treat
exceptions
to
the
hearsay
rule?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
the
exemption
in
the
case
of
co-conspirator
evidence
based
on
inherent
reliability
of
that
evidence?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
you
could
have
called
him
on
cross
examination
as
a
witness.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
don't
think
i
follow
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
don't
you
think
that
even
if
the
government
had
called
him,
they
could
have
called
him
and
put
him
under
cross
examination
as
an
adverse
witness?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
isn't
a
co-conspirator
inherently
an
adverse
witness
and
always
subject
to
being
called,
it
at
all,
on
cross
examination
by
the
state?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
doesn't
mean
they
might
not
have
been.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
frey,
your
argument
sounds
a
lot
like
that
espoused
by
justice
harlan
in
dutton,
which
wasn't
adopted,
of
course.
