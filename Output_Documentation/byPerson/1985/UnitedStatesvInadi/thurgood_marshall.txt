mr.
frey,
there
is
a
third
one.
the
judge
can
call
him
as
his
witness.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
what
i
mean.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
they
hadn't
been
able
to
use
his
testimony,
they
might
have
wanted
to
call
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
--on
the
other
hand,
in
this
instance,
you
have
the
government
having
the
benefit
of
capable
testimony
without
cross
examination.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--did
defendant
make
the
motion
to
put
this
evidence
in?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
is
who
did
it.
you
don't
deny
you
did
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
put
in
evidence
which
was
favorable
to
you,
and
unable
to
have
it
cross
examined
by
the
other
side.
justice
thurgood
marshall
wouldn't
you
prefer
to
have
evidence
for
your
side
not
cross
examined?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
they
had
no
responsibility
for
him.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
frey,
before
you
get
started,
i
want
to
try
to
see
how
far
we
can
go.
am
i
correct
that
in
the
prosecutor's
office,
state
and
federal,
when
it
comes
time
for
the
prosecution,
your
investigating
group
gives
you
a
list
of
witnesses,
saying
what
they
will
testify,
and
how
they
will
stand
up
on
cross
examination?
is
that
true?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
would
happen
if
you
as
a
prosecutor
were
given
the
name
of
a
witness,
lazaro,
and
it
says
either
that
this
man
is
an
unmitigated
liar
and
he
can't
be
pinned
down
to
anything,
or
it
says
he
will
go
along
with
any
question
that
anybody
asks,
and
on
four
different
occasions
has
completely
collapsed
on
cross
examination,
and
you
had
the
choice
of
either
putting
him
on
the
stand
or
putting
in
his
statement?
which
would
you
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
would
use
the
statement.
