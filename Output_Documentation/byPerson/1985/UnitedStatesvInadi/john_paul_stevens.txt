justice
john
paul
stevens
my
i
ask
one
question?
to
what
extent
does
your
argument
rest
on
the
peculiar
facts
as
you
describe
them
here
that
the
statement
that
they
seek
to
use
was
a
narrative
of
prior
events
rather
than
a
statement
such
as
go
out
to
the
airport
and
pick
up
the
marijuana
or
something
like
that
that
isn't
offered
for
the
truth
of
what
is
said,
but
is
really
as
a
declaration
in
furtherance
of
an
ongoing
conspiracy?
would
you
make
the
same
argument
with
respect
to
that
kind
of
co-conspirator
declaration?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
what
most
of
these
usually
are--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
the
other
question
along
the
line
i
did
a
moment
ago?
i
did
not
really
recall
that
you
brief
laid
the
emphasis
that
you
do
today
on
the
historical
narrative
of
past
fact.
i
didn't
really
catch
that
point
in
reading
your
brief,
if
i
remember
it
correctly.
did
you
argue
that?
did
you
make
that
same
kind
of
emphasis,
distinguishing
that
kind
of
statement
from
ones
typical
in
furtherance--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that
is
really
a
critical
part
of
your
argument
this
afternoon.
it
kind
of
came
as
a
surprise
to
me,
but
you
did
make
that
argument
below,
too?
