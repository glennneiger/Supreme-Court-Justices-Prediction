plus
the
fact
that
they
are
against
interest,
against
their--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
might
try
to
impeach
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
sure,
you
have
to
ask
him
first.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
he
is
there,
they
get
him
there,
and
they
put
him
on
the
stand.
then
what
do
they
do?
i
would
suppose
you
would
argue
they
couldn't
use
the
tapes
at
all.
they
would
just
have
to
ask
him
what
the
facts
were.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
would
they
proceed,
then?
would
they
say,
here
are
the
tapes,
did
you
say
this,
or
didn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
he
says
yes?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
are
you
going
to
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
about
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
you
would
much
rather
have
the
government
call
him,
but
this
evidence
came
in,
so
no
way
didn't
you
call
him
on
your
side
of
the
case?
wouldn't
you
have
rather
had
him
on
your
side
of
the
case
than
not
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
apparently
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
didn't
try
to
get
him
either.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
that
his
car
had
broken
down.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
could
get
a
subpoena.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
could
certainly
ask
him
if
what
he
said
was
true,
what
he
said
on
the
tapes
was
true.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
what
you
would
try
to
find
out.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
suppose
you
would
make
the
same
argument...
if
there
wasn't
a
confrontation
clause,
you
would
be
making
the
same
argument
about
hearsay,
that
there
just
shouldn't
be
an
exception
to
the
hearsay
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
think
you
would.
your
argument
goes
right
there,
because
in
effect
you
are
negating
the
exception
to
the
hearsay
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
at
least
under
the
hearsay
rules
you
never
had
to
produce
the
man
to
get--
