mr.
william
t.
crisp
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
the
demurrage
of
the
paper,
briefs,
briefcases,
is
ample
testimony
to
how
long
this
case
has
been
going
on,
as
well
as
the
deluge
of
briefs
and
the
record
that's
been
filed
with
you.
i
hope
to
cut
through
much
of
that
and
get
to
the
conceptual
and
theoretical
aspects
of
the
case
and,
more
importantly
perhaps,
to
a
recharacterization
of
the
facts,
which
we
will
begin
by
asserting
to
you
have
not
been
stated
correctly
to
you
by
the
appellants.
indeed,
we
don't
think
that
you
would
have
noted
probable
jurisdiction
if
the
facts
as
we
want
to
give
them
to
you
now
had
been
before
you
when
you
made
that
decision.
mr.
william
t.
crisp
we
tried
to.
but
you've
got
some
facts
before
you
now
in
the
form
of
appellants'
briefs
and
reply
brief
that
make
it
very,
very
difficult
for
us--
mr.
william
t.
crisp
--no,
sir,
they're
in
the
record.
they're
just
mischaracterizations,
some
absolute
misstatements.
and
we've
got
those
documented.
i
would
urge
the
court
please
to
read
not
only
our
brief,
but
the
amicus
brief
of
the
town
of
highlands
and
the
north
carolina
commission,
because
among
the
three
of
us,
you
know,
there
is
only
so
many
pages
we
can
use
in
the
brief.
among
the
three
of
us,
we've
got
those
mischaracterizations
pretty
well
identified
and
corrected,
justice
white.
and
i
think
you'll
find
out
that
my
characterization
of
their
mischaracterization
is
correct.
now,
if
i
may,
and
for
that
reason
i
would
like
to
start
by
giving
you
a
kind
of
a
kaleidoscopic
view
of
the
facts.
and
when
i
say
facts,
i
don't
mean
just
facts
in
terms
of
evidentiary
facts.
i'm
talking
about
facts
in
terms
of
what
did
ferc
do
in
its
order,
what
did
the
north
carolina
commission
do
in
its
order,
as
opposed
to
what
the
appellants
in
this
case
say
was
done.
i
begin
with
a
negative.
this
case
is
not
a
case
between
north
carolina
and
tennessee.
this
case
is
not
a
case
of
the
economic
interests
on
north
carolinians
against
the
economic
interests
of
the
volunteer
state.
it
is
not,
in
the
final
analysis,
we
think
you
will
conclude,
a
case
of
north
carolina
jurisdictional
assertion
over
retail
ratemaking
versus
ferc
jurisdiction
over
wholesale
ratemaking.
what
it
is,
and
the
history
of
how
we
got
to
this
courtroom,
which
began
in
the
early
part
of
this
century,
what
it
is
is
the
final
coming
to
a
judicial
apex
where
you're
going
to
determine
whether
or
not
alcoa
is
going
to
be
able,
through
the
guise
of
public
utility
subsidiaries,
to
deprive
the
public...
not
north
carolina
and
not
the
public
of
north
carolina,
but
the
public
of
both
states
in
this
particular
case...
of
resources
benefits
unlawfully
and
through
the
ruse
of
invoking
at
this
late
date
the
protective
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission,
which
it
has
steadfastly
defied
and
tried
for
decades
to
keep
from
coming
under.
mr.
william
t.
crisp
north
carolina
and
tennessee.
in
that
regard,
i
think
it's
good
for
me
now
to
give
a
more
precise
answer
to
justice
rehnquist's
question
concerning
the
location
of
tapoco.
tapoco
was
the
knoxville
power
company.
it
was
incorporated
as
public
utility
in
tennessee,
with
the
power
of
eminent
domain,
which
it
exercised.
and
only
contemporaneously
with
coming
into
north
carolina,
domesticating
there
and
seeking
and
getting
a
certificate
of
convenience
and
necessity,
which
it
had
to
do
and
could
do
only
if
it
was
a
public
utility
in
north
carolina,
did
it
change
its
name
to
tapoco.
it
has
four
hydroelectric
projects.
two
of
them
lie
across
the
tennessee
border
in
tennessee,
two
of
them
lie
in
north
carolina.
corporately,
it's
domesticated
in
the
state
of
north
carolina.
so
in
effect,
justice
rehnquist,
it
occupies
both
states
as
a
corporate
entity,
and
it
is
a
public
utility
in
the
state
of
tennessee,
as
well
as
in
the
state
of
north
carolina.
i
think
next
i
should
respond
to
justice
o'connor's
question
about
imprudence.
imprudence
was
an
issue
in
this
case.
it
was
almost
the
issue
in
this
case,
because
imprudence
goes
not
only
to
the
decision
and
choice
of
a
supplier
as
to
options
that
it
has
with
regard
to
its
power
supply,
but,
given
a
determination
properly
that
that
option
was
not
wisely
and
prudently
exercised,
it
goes
to
the
question,
when
we
flow
through
the
requirement
of
honoring
ferc-set
rates,
who
is
to
bear
the
burden
of
those
rates
as
between
the
retail
ratepayers
and
the
stockholders.
one
of
the
things,
one
of
the
parts
of
the
lexicon
of
this
case
that
you
should
be
aware
of
is
that
the
appellants
are
constantly
referring
to
alcoa
as
a
customer
of
tapoco.
it
is
a
customer
of
tapoco,
but
primarily
in
this
case
it
is
a
utility
company.
certainly
in
the
state
of
north
carolina
it's
a
public
utility,
and
it
owns
two
public
utility
subsidiaries,
and
as
such
is
the
sole
stockholder
in
those.
now,
was
there
any
reason
for
inquiring
into
nantahala's
prudence
in
letting
itself
be
manipulated
the
way
it
could
not
otherwise
do,
being
wholly
owned
by
the
master
alcoa?
let
me
quote
to
you
from
what
our
commission's
order
said,
affirmed,
incidentally,
by
our
supreme
court.
and
i'm
on
233a
of
the
appendix:
"the
commission
must
conclude
that
alcoa
has
so
dominated
these
transactions
and
agreements
affecting
its
wholly
owned
subsidiary
nantahala
that
nantahala
has
been
left
but
an
empty
shell,
unable
to
act
in
its
own
interests,
let
alone
in
the
interests
of
its
public
utility
customers
in
north
carolina.
"
if
you
want
to
put
that
in
the
context
of
the
sinclair
case
and
of
the
pike
power
&
light
company
case
in
pennsylvania,
the
analogy
i
think
is
pretty
clear.
here
is
a
captive
subsidiary,
owned
not
by
a
company
that
is
primarily
engaged
in
the
production
of
power
to
make
money
off
of
that,
but
to
feel
its
own
smeltering
process
with
it.
and
for
that
reason,
the
prudence
rule
gets
abused
because
the
helplessly
owned
subsidiary
cannot
make
any
choice
except
what
the
parent
lets
it
make.
they
didn't
even
let
nantahala
sign
the
first
fontana
agreement.
they
committed
the
resources
without
even
letting
it
sign
the
document.
nantahala
did
not
negotiate,
it
didn't
participate
in
the
negotiations
of
the
apportionment
agreement
or
the
new
fontana
agreement.
they
did
pay
it
the
perfunctory
honor
of
letting
it
execute
those
documents.
now,
given
that
kind
of
domination,
massive
domination,
which
is
uncontested
in
this
record,
and
a
finding
which
is
not
up
for
review
before
this
court,
i
think
you
can
see
why
someone
had
to
play
the
role
of
surrogate
for
nantahala.
and
we
stand
here
today
as
that
surrogate.
the
commission
of
north
carolina
is
the
proxy
for
that
company.
we
stand
in
its
shoes,
asking
for
what
it
ought
to
ask
for.
mr.
william
t.
crisp
they're
talking
about
a
wholesale
exchange
arrangement,
senator...
senator.
mr.
william
t.
crisp
justice
rehnquist.
i
would
apologize,
but
i'm
afraid
there
may
be
a
senator
in
here
and
that
might
get
me
into
trouble.
[laughter]
what
they're
saying
is
that
what
north
carolina
did
was
to
fail
to
give
heed
to
the
nfa
and
the
apportionment
agreement,
and
for
that
reason
it's
got
to
fall
under
the
narragansett
line
of
cases.
now,
we
say
this
to
you
about
that.
we
didn't
do
anything
in
north
carolina
that
affected
the
continuation
and
the
operation
of
the
new
fontana
agreement
and
the
apportionment
agreement.
not
a
single
thing
did
we
do
that
affected
that.
it
has
continued
until
it
was
succeeded
by
another
agreement
after
the
locked-in
period.
it
has
continued
in
effect.
it
has
been
honored
accounting-wise
and
otherwise
by
the
parties.
mr.
william
t.
crisp
yes,
i'm
aware
of
that
and
i
want
to
respond
to
that
type
of
rationale
right
now.
justice
rehnquist,
let
us
assume
that
all
of
nantahala
and
tapoco,
and
the
alcoa
load
too,
as
far
as
that's
concerned,
do
in
fact
constitute
one
corporate
entity.
and
like
cp&l
straddling
the
carolina
borders
or
duke,
which
does
the
same
thing,
they
are
now
before
the
north
carolina
commission
to
set
rates.
that
is
done
almost
universally
by
determining
what
the
total
demand
is
that
is
being
satisfied
by
those
companies,
then
ratioing
the
portion
of
that
demand
that
the
retail
public
in
north
carolina
is
putting
on
that
system,
and
then
you
allocate
costs
accordingly.
that's
purely
and
simply
what
we
did
here,
and
i
say
to
you,
sir,
that
that's
what
we
should
have
done.
we've
already
had
the
concession
that
piercing
the
corporate
veil
didn't
particularly
bother
the
appellants.
i'm
glad
to
hear
them
say
that,
because
when
we
did
that
we
were
dealing
with
one
entity,
we
were
dealing
with
one
system.
and
incidentally,
the
one
entity,
one
system
finding
is
unchallenged
in
this
record.
it
is
not
an
issue
before
this
court
or
subject
to
being
upset
by
this
court.
so
that
all
north
carolina
did
was
take
the
agreements
as
they
existed
and
left
them
alone.
we
didn't
like
them.
we
don't
think
they're
reasonable.
but
it's
like
that
old
adage
about
the
lovely
lady:
you
can
look,
but
don't
touch.
and
we
didn't
touch.
we
looked,
but
we
didn't
touch.
we
did
not
disturb
those
agreements.
we
left
them
right
where
they
were.
now,
the
methodology
arrived
at
certainly
has
historic
actual
and
judicial
foundations
for
honoring
by
this
court.
it
has
been
held...
and
we
have
cited
the
cases
in
the
briefs...
numerously
that
the
methodologies
employed
in
setting
retail
rates
need
not
be
the
same
as
followed
by
the
ferc.
let
me
give
you
some
of
the
largesse
that
the
company
got
the
benefit
of
in
north
carolina.
we
let
them
redepreciate
their
war...
depreciated
assets.
ferc
denied
it
in
139a.
we
let
them
put
on
a
purchase
power
adjustment
clause
in
north
carolina.
ferc
denied
it.
ferc
is
an
original
cost
rate
base
commission.
we
are
a
fair
value
rate
base
commission.
there
is
nothing
that
dictates
that
every
nuance
and
refinement
of
methodology
followed
by
the
federal
commission
has
got
to
be
adhered
to
by
the
commissions
that
regulate
retail
rates.
and
if
there
were
such
a
thing
as
that,
i
think
you
could
certainly
be
looking
at
madness
throughout
the
union
today,
rather
than
a
fairly
logical
and
well-oiled
scheme
that
allows
a
balanced
and
equitable
sharing
of
these
responsibilities
as
between
the
states
and
retailers
on
the
one
hand
and
the
federal
government
and
interstate
wholesale
transactions
on
the
other.
mr.
william
t.
crisp
let
me
say
this
to
you.
mr.
william
t.
crisp
we
are
in
whole
agreement
with
the
narragansett
case.
and
my
answer
to
you
says
simply
this:
in
this
case,
that's
not
what
we're
dealing
with.
we
think
if
we
were
talking
about
a
truly
filed
rate,
that
would
be
a
different
proposition.
mr.
william
t.
crisp
well,
a
filed
rate,
among
other
things,
is
a
rate
that
has
been
filed
and
has
been
accepted,
or
at
least
permitted
to
go
into
effect,
by
the
commission
until
and
if
it's
changed
by
the
commission.
mr.
william
t.
crisp
yes,
ma'am.
that
is
my
position.
and
i
want
to
elaborate
on
that
by
saying
to
you,
justice
o'connor,
that
here,
when
you
go
to
139,
139a,
139b,
you're
not
in
the
classic
wholesale
power
disagreement.
there
were
three
wholesale
customers:
one
university,
one
electric
cooperative,
and
one
town
of
highlands.
and
only
in
an
ancillary
sense
did
the
nfa
and
the
apportionment
agreement
get
into
it
at
all.
they
were
looked
at
because
we
alleged
that
they
were
unfair
and
that
they
ought
to
roll
the
companies
together
for
ratemaking
purposes.
they
did
not
do
that.
but
i
think
it's
important
to
give
you
the
quotation
from
the
ferc
order
on
north
carolina's
right
to
do
that,
because
they
paid
deference
to
that
right.
and
i'm
on
page
23
of
our
brief:
ferc
commission's
order...
"we
recognize
that
the
north
carolina
utilities
commission,
based
on
a
similar
record,
reached
a
different
conclusion
concerning
rolled-in
costing.
"
"however,
the
question
of
whether
to
treat
various
entities
as
an
integrated
system
for
ratemaking
purposes
is
not
a
purely
factual
question,
but
also
rests
on
criteria
which
each
ratemaking
authority
may
deem
relevant.
"
now,
we
say
to
you
that,
if
not
expressly,
certainly
impliedly
ferc
was
saying:
well,
we
recognize
the
fact...
and
we
were
first.
our
order
had
come
down
before
this
order
was
written,
at
least
our
initial
order
had.
so
our
final
order
has
come
down.
we've
gone
one
route
on
this
issue
of
roll-in,
which
would
have
required
in
effect
the
piercing
of
the
corporate
veil,
and
north
carolina
has
gone
the
other
way.
well,
we
recognize
that
different
commissions
have
different
criteria,
different
standards
in
determinations
for
performing
their
particular
rate
regulating
functions,
and
that's
fine
with
us.
we
have
no
complaint
with
that
at
all.
so
the
concession
that
we
could
go
that
route
is
written
into
139,
and
in
a
very
real
sense
the
ferc
stands
in
this
court
today
and
through
briefing
and
argument
is
trying
to
reverse
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
which
affirmed
that
order.
now,
we
say
they
can't
come
back
and
have
not
only
a
second
bite
at
that
apple,
but
bite
it
from
the
core
up
instead
of
from
the
top
down.
it
can't
be
done
that
way.
mr.
william
t.
crisp
the
two
groups
were
alcoa
and
the
publics
of
north
carolina
and
tennessee.
they
may
have
been
fighting
elsewhere
also.
mr.
william
t.
crisp
no,
they're
not,
not
elsewhere...
but
the
fight,
and
i
did
get
off
of
this.
mr.
william
t.
crisp
well,
you
don't.
mr.
william
t.
crisp
and
that
i'm
saying
to
you
is--
mr.
william
t.
crisp
--that
they
are
here,
justice
marshall.
what
i
meant
was
that
the
company
may
have
abused
publics
in
other
areas
of
the
country,
too,
and
they're
not
here.
but
i'm
saying
this:
the
people
whom
they
abused
in
north
carolina
are
here.
i
represent
five
counties,
five
towns,
the
eastern
band
of
the
cherokee
indians,
justice
marshall,
and
one
henry
truett,
the
consumers
in
the
area
served
by
the
company.
mr.
william
t.
crisp
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
william
t.
crisp
mr.
thornburg,
the
attorney
general,
is
here
and
he
represents
the
state
of
north
carolina.
he's
been
in
these
cases
from
the
beginning.
i
should
say
his
office
has.
mr.
william
t.
crisp
et
al.--
mr.
william
t.
crisp
--et
al.--
mr.
william
t.
crisp
--no,
that's
not
a
mistake.
mr.
william
t.
crisp
that's
correct.
mr.
william
t.
crisp
no,
sir.
i
am
representing
all
of
the
appellees
in
this
argument.
i
was
chosen
by
them
for
that
purpose,
justice
marshall.
mr.
william
t.
crisp
now,
the
battle
that
i
alluded
to,
and
i'm
sorry
i
deviated
from,
was
this.
alcoa
came
into
north
carolina
in
the
early
part
of
this
century
and
it
wanted
to
dam
up
our
streams,
generate
cheap
hydroelectric
power,
gargantuan
quantities
of
which
are
required
to
smelt
aluminum.
and
they
suddenly
ran
into
a
phenomenon
that
is
not
indigenous
to
the
mountain
people
of
tennessee
and
north
carolina.
i
think
it
pervades
the
country.
people
don't
want
their
land
dammed
and
lakes
built
on
them.
they
don't
want
privately
and
voluntarily
to
sell
out.
so
what
did
alcoa
do?
first
of
all,
it
bought
a
utility.
that
was
tallassee.
tallassee's
name
was
changed
to
carolina
aluminum.
carolina
aluminum's
name
was
changed
to
yadkin,
inc.
see,
we're
getting
farther
and
farther
away
from
the
concept
of
a
utility.
and
yet,
it
was
carolina
aluminum
who
sold,
transferred,
the
two
dams
in
north
carolina
to
tapoco.
what
they
did,
they
created
these
subsidiaries
with
the
power
of
eminent
domain,
and
they
not
only
exercised
that
power
with
respect
to
condemnation
proceedings,
they
pervasively
exercised
it
in
threatening
people
to
give
up
their
land
who
otherwise
wouldn't
do
it.
and
under
the
guise
of
a
public
utility
they
then
went
in
and
acquired
the
rights
to
build
the
dams,
generate
the
power,
and
then
by
corporate
manipulation,
spinning
off
these
facilities'
ownership
from
nantahala
to
tapoco,
drained
all
of
the
low
cost
power
to
alcoa
in
tennessee.
and
the
higher
cost
power
was
left
to
the
people
who
were
served
in
north
carolina,
and
it
would
have
been
true
if
they
had
been
serving
across
the
line
in
tennessee
as
far
as
that
is
concerned,
which
we
did
for
a
while.
we
did
for
a
while.
the
wrongness
of
that
was
first
recognized
by
our
supreme
court
in
1954
in
the
mead
corporation
case,
which
we
cite.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
we
close
with
a
quotation
from
that
case.
it
was
found
by
our
court
to
be
a
wrong
in
1963,
when
alcoa
attempted
to
shed
its
public
utility
responsibility
by
selling
off
its
distribution
system
and
customers
and
retaining
these
hydro
facilities
for
its
own.
and
then,
of
course,
it
has
attempted
to
do
the
same
thing
through
the
nfa
and
the
apportionment
agreement.
now,
let
me
conclude,
if
i
may,
by
asking
just
three
of
four
rhetorical
questions
and
making
one
request
and
taking
note
of
an
historical
marker
which
today
is.
why
do
we
stand
here
as
proxy
for
the
company?
why
isn't
the
company
up
here
arguing
for
what
in
effect
is
a
real
good
deal
for
it
under
the
north
carolina
commission's
order?
why
didn't
it
fight
for
that
kind
of
benefit
upstairs
in
ferc?
well,
the
answer
is
very
simple
and
i
don't
think
they
would
even
deny
it.
they're
helpless
to
do
otherwise.
they're
put
in
the
absolute
ridiculous
posture
of
opposing
their
own
best
interests,
which
then
of
course
flows
down
to
the
detriment
of
the
customers,
because
they
are
captive
to
a
wholly
owned
master
who
is
not
a
public
utility
in
the
traditional
sense,
but
is
in
business
to
make
money
by
making
and
selling
aluminum.
why
is
our
commission
acting
as
their
surrogate?
who
else
is
there
to
do
it?
shall
we
go
into
court
and
ask
for
the
appointment
of
a
conservator
or
a
trustor
to
bring
this
action
on
its
behalf
against
its
parent?
this
is
the
logical
way
that
the
problem
ought
to
be
resolved.
and
i
say
to
you
that
it
has
taken
35
years
of
litigation
and
over
50
years
of
discovery
really
to
get
this
nasty
picture
out
and
revealed
for
the
very,
very
terrible
thing
that
it
is.
and
it's
nothing
more
nor
less
than
an
absconsion
by
a
corporate
giant,
a
multinational
corporate
giant,
of
public
assets
preferred
to
its
own
benefit
and
to
the
expense
of
the
public.
surely
that
makes
appropriate
then
this
question.
they
come
here
as
a
last
desperate
effort.
i
say
that
for
this
reason.
they
never
raised
their
federal
questions
until
they
filed
their
first
brief
on
exceptions
to
the
initial
commission
order
issued
in
september
of
1981.
not
in
their
pleadings,
not
in
their
objections
to
evidence,
not
in
their
production
of
testimony.
mr.
william
t.
crisp
yes,
and
i'm
not
saying,
sir...
i
want
to
make
that
clear.
i'm
not
saying
they're
not
here.
mr.
william
t.
crisp
i'm
bringing
it
up
solely
for
this
reason,
sir.
this
case
has
been
literally
through
the
supreme
court
and
back
twice
in
north
carolina.
it's
been
to
the
district
court
and
the
fourth
circuit
court.
it
has
been
litigated
and
litigated
and
litigated.
and
not
until
that
last
moment,
so
to
speak,
did
they
raise
this
question.
and
they
had
the
right
to
do
that.
i'm
not
arguing
that.
but
they
are
latecomers
to
that
theory
in
this
case.
finally,
today
marks
the
150th
anniversary
of
the
battle
of
san
jacinto,
and
i
think
everybody
in
this
room
knows
what
happened
there.
a
real
smart
sam
houston,
knowing
that
mexican
take
siesta,
waited
until
about
4:00
o'clock
and
then,
with
the
sun
behind
his
back
and
some
600
soldiers,
really
decimated
santa
ana's
army.
how
does
that
bear
on
what's
going
on
here?
texas
became
a
liberated,
independent
republic,
and
it
wavered
for
several
years
before
it
opted
as
to
whether
to
come
into
this
union.
very
independent
people,
nobody
would
gainsay
that.
but
they
finally
opted
to
come,
and
one
of
the
reasons
they
came...
and
sam
houston
was
one
of
the
proponents
for
it...
was
that
the
constitution
held
this
balance
of
powers
between
semi-sovereign
states
and
a
federal
union.
and
we're
talking
here
today,
chief
justice
burger
and
fellow
justices,
we're
talking
here
today
about
balancing
equity
between
the
federal
scheme
of
regulation
and
the
state
of
regulation.
and
the
wrong
that
has
been
done,
the
wrong
that
has
been
done,
cannot
be
corrected
by
merely
invoking
carte
blanche
a
set
of
principles
that
have
come
down
in
other,
really
inapplicable
cases.
and
so
we
hope
that
you,
certainly
not
intentionally,
will
not
do
what
this
company
is
asking
you
to
do,
which
is
to
become
its
handmaiden
in
extricating
it
from
what
was
finally
determined
to
be
the
proper
and
the
equitable
resolution
of
the
problems
it's
created.
