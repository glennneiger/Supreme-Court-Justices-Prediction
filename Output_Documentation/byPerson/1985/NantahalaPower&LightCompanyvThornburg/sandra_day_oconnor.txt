well,
mr.
lee,
what's
the
filed
rate
that
the
north
carolina
commission
is
bound
by?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
apportionment
agreement?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
could
the
north
carolina
commission
have
followed
the
actual
allocation
of
entitlements--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--yes.
i
mean,
it
just...
there's
something
missing
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
it's
your
view
that
north
carolina
was
bound
by
that
apportionment
agreement,
even
though
ferc
later
changed?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if
nantahala
had
gone
out
and
purchased
high
cost
power
at
a
rate
on
file
with
ferc,
which
the
north
carolina
utilities
commission
subsequently
decided
nantahala
had
imprudently
and
unnecessarily
purchased?
and
why
is
this
different?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
just,
it
seems
to
me
that
ferc
didn't
quite
act
by
changing
a
filed
rate
or
modifying
the
apportionment
agreement.
it
just
didn't
give
full
effect
to
it.
i
mean,
ferc
didn't
act
in
the
way
that
one
would
expect
ferc
to
act
if
it
were
really
dealing
with
this
as
a
filed
rate.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
crisp,
do
you
agree
that
the
commission
must
apply
the
filed
rate
that
ferc
has
on
file
for
wholesale
power--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
computing
the
retail?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
is
the
filed
rate
here
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
it
your
position
that
the
agreements
on
file
were
not
filed
rates?
