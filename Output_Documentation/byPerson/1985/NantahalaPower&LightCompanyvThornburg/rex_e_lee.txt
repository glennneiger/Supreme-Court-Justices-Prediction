mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
notwithstanding
the
length
of
the
lower
court's
opinion
and
notwithstanding
the
variety
of
the
appellees'
arguments,
this
is
at
bottom
a
simple
case
whose
solution
is
controlled
by
one
simple
and
eminently
sensible
principle
of
law,
namely
that
the
federal
power
act
requires
state
regulators,
when
they
set
retail
electric
rates,
to
include
within
those
rates
power
supply
costs
incurred
as
a
result
of
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission's
rate
schedules
and
decisions.
today
much
of
our
nation's
electricity
is
distributed
under
interstate
arrangements
which
are
subject
at
one
stage
of
the
process
to
ferc's
wholesale
regulatory
authority,
and
then
at
a
later
stage
to
local
retail
ratemaking.
it
is
also
quite
common
that
interstate
electric
suppliers
have
more
than
one
source
of
power
and
that
the
costs
of
the
different
sources
vary
widely.
where
that
occurs,
each
affected
state
would
like
to
have
for
itself
and
its
consumers
as
much
as
possible
of
the
low
cost
power
and
as
little
as
possible
of
the
high
cost.
someone
has
to
decide
who
gets
how
much
of
each.
the
logical
candidate,
indeed
the
only
logical
candidate,
is
ferc,
because
it
is
the
only
regulatory
authority
that,
even
as
a
theoretical
matter,
has
no
reason
to
favor
the
interests
of
one
state
over
those
of
another.
appropriately
enough,
it
is
a
series
of
state
supreme
court
decisions
which
have
held
that
the
federal
power
act
requires
that
logical
result,
that
is
that
the
federal
power
act
requires
that
state
regulators
include
all
ferc-regulated
power
supply
costs
in
the
retail
rates.
this
does
not
preclude
the
states
from
their
customary
function
of
setting
the
retail
rates.
it
simply
fixes
one
of
the
cost
components.
here
the
question
involves
the
competing
interests
of
two
states,
tennessee
and
north
carolina,
and
two
electric
retailers,
both
of
which
are
wholly
owned
subsidiaries
of
alcoa.
one
of
them,
nantahala
power
and
light,
serves
exclusively
a
public
load
in
north
carolina;
and
the
other,
tapoco,
inc.,
serves
only
alcoa's
aluminum
plant
in
tennessee.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
a
short
distance
over
the
north
carolina-tennessee
border,
in
eastern
tennessee.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
would
say,
justice
rehnquist,
on
the
order
of
50,
60
miles,
but
i
could
be
off
by
a
few
yards.
during
the
period
at
issue,
nantahala
and
tapoco
operated
under
two
contracts
that
were
filed
with
ferc
as
rate
schedules.
under
one
of
them,
called
the
new
fontana
agreement,
tva
incorporates
the
hydroelectric
generation
of
these
two
companies
into
its
system
and
then
delivers
back
electricity
which
is
lesser
in
quantity,
but
more
dependable.
these
nfa
entitlements
from
tva
were
divided
between
nantahala
and
tapoco
by
a
1971
apportionment
agreement.
prior
to
that
time,
that
is
prior
to
1971,
nantahala's
entitlements
had
been
sufficient
for
its
customers'
needs.
but
since
then,
nantahala,
like
tapoco
before
it,
has
had
to
purchase
additional
power
from
tva.
and
these
tva
power
purchases
cost
more
than
three
times
as
much
as
the
hydro
entitlements.
so
that
for
each
company,
the
power
supply
cost
is
a
blend
cost,
resulting
in
the
consequence
that
an
increase
in
the
amount
of
its
entitlements
for
either
company
means
a
decrease
in
its
purchases
and
consequently
a
decrease
in
its
total
cost
of
power
and
in
its
customers'
electric
bills.
and
that's
what
the
dispute
in
this
case
is
all
about:
how
much
of
this
low
cost
entitlement
power
should
be
allocated
to
nantahala's
customers,
all
of
whom
are
in
north
carolina,
and
how
much
to
tapoco's
customers
in
tennessee?
in
one
sense,
the
case
varies
from
the
usual
pattern
because
it
involves
the
allocation
of
low
cost
ferc-regulated
power,
where
in
each
of
the
narragansett
and
northern
states
line
of
cases,
the
issue
was
high
cost.
and
yet,
high
cost
power
is
also
at
issue
here,
because
for
both
companies
and
both
states
the
real
cost
is
the
mix
of
the
entitlements
and
the
purchases.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
filed
rate
in
this
instance
was
the
new
fontana
agreement,
supplemented
by
the
1971
allocation.
that
is
the
filed
rate.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
apportionment
agreement
was
filed
as
a
supplement
to
the
nfa.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
when
it
hadn't
been
made?
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
clear
that
up.
since
it
had
been
filed,
under
this
court's
decision
in
the
montana-dakota
utilities
case,
it
was
binding
as
a
filed
rate
so
long
as
it
was
not
modified.
so
that
the
north
carolina
utilities
commission
during
the
interim
period
between
the
filing
date
and
any
modification
made
to
it
had
available
to
it
two
options.
it
could
have
followed
either
one.
one
was
simply
to
wait,
to
abstain
and
wait
until
ferc
actually
made
the
allocation.
the
other
option
was
to
go
ahead
and
deal
with
all
of
the
issue
except
the
power
supply
costs
and
regard
itself
as
being
bound
by
the
power
supply
that
was
reflected
in
the
filed
rate,
the
nfa
as
filed,
subject
to
any
refund
that
might
be
due
once
ferc
modified
the
schedules.
clearly
what
it
was
bound
by
was
the
filed
rate
up
until
the
time
that
it
was
actually
modified.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
and
then
once
ferc
made
the
change,
then
north
carolina
could
similarly
go
back
and
make
the
same
change
that
was
reflected
in
the
ferc
agreement.
and
that
is
the
thrust
of
narragansett
and
northern
states
and
these
various
state
cases.
the
only
exception
is
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
decision
in
this
case.
what
north
carolina
did
here,
justice
o'connor,
by
departing
from
that
procedure
was
to
take
from
tennessee
in
effect
a
share
that
properly
belonged
to
tennessee.
by
sweetening
its
own
mix,
it
increased
the
cost
to
tennessee.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it's
different
for
this
reason,
that
that
simply
is
not
the
fact
in
this
case,
and
there
was
no
issue
of
whether
this
particular
purchase
or
this
particular
arrangement,
the
nfa,
in
which
it
got
low
cost
power,
was
or
was
not
prudent--
the
question
that
you
have
just
raised
is
the
question
that
is
raised
by
the
pike
county
and
sinclair
machine
products
case.
that
is
a
difficult
issue
that
this
court
need
not
resolve,
namely
in
those
instances
where
ferc
does
not
actually
face
and
decide
the
question
of
how
they
should
be
allocated,
where
ferc
could
have
decided
it
but
did
not,
is
that
then
binding
on
the
states?
that's
a
difficult
question
and
a
close
one,
but
it
need
not
be
resolved
in
this
case,
because
in
this
case
the
only
issue
is
how
should
these
entitlements
be
allocated.
ferc
has
made
that
decision,
and
under
the
narragansett
and
northern
states
line
of
cases
that
decision
is
binding
on
ferc.
it
is
also
our
position
that
the
economic
preference
that
north
carolina
has
erected
for
itself
by
sweetening
its
mix
of
the
entitlements
between
the
purchases
and
the
entitlement
power
is
a
violation
of
the
commerce
clause.
but
this
court
need
not
reach
the
commerce
clause
issue
because
of
the
availability
of
a
statutory
ground
for
the
decision,
and
that
statutory
ground
is
the
availability
of
this
narragansett-northern
states
doctrine.
the
appellees
really
do
not
argue,
or
they
do
not
purport
to
argue,
with
the
basic
narragansett
principle,
but
they
contend
that
it's
inapplicable
here
for
a
variety
of
reasons,
none
of
which
is
on
the
mark.
and
i
would
like
to
examine
just
very
briefly
the
three
assertions
that
appear
with
greatest
frequency
in
that
respect.
probably
the
most
frequent
is
that
the
ferc
rate
schedules,
the
nfa
as
supplemented
by
the
apportionment
agreement,
is
not
a
proper
basis
for
making
cost
allocations,
because
that
agreement
is
the
product
of
alcoa's
alleged
domination
of
nantahala
and
tapoko.
the
short
answer
to
that
allegation
is
that
it
comes
too
late.
ferc
squarely
considered
it
and
rejected
it,
and
ferc's
position
was
sustained
by
the
fourth
circuit
in
an
appeal
taken
by
these
appellees.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
oh,
indeed
they
were.
indeed
they
were.
it
was
initiated
by
nantahala's
wholesale
customers,
but
apparently
because
they
sensed
that
coming
out
of
that
proceeding
would
be
an
allocation
of
the
nfa
entitlements,
the
north
carolina
attorney
general
intervened
in
those
ferc
proceedings
and
participated
fully
throughout
them,
and
he
made
very
clear
that
he
was
intervening
on
behalf
of
interests
of
all
of
nantahala's
retail
customers.
and
then,
once
ferc
had
made
its
decision,
the
north
carolina
attorney
general
appealed
to
the
fourth
circuit
on
the
ground
that
ferc
had
not
given
enough
of
the
entitlement
power
to
the
retailers.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
we
submit
that
the
reason
that
it
is
the
filed
rate
doctrine
is
that
the
nfa
as
supplemented
by
the
apportionment
agreement
did
make
an
apportionment
of
the
entitlements.
ferc
then
considered
this
very
argument,
that
it
should
not
be
a...
that
it
was
not
a
fair
basis
for
apportionment
of
the
entitlement
because
of
alcoa's
alleged
domination
of
the
two
companies.
and
what
it
concluded
was
that
the
nfa
was
in
all
respects
fair,
but
that
an
adjustment
needed
to
be
made
to
the
1971
apportionment
agreement,
and
it
made
the
adjustment
that
in
ferc's
judgment
was
necessary
in
order
to
constitute
just
and
reasonable
rates.
once
ferc
reached
that
determination
as
to
what
was
a
just
and
reasonable
rate,
then
under
the
federal
power
act
as
interpreted
by
the
state
supreme
court
decisions
that
constituted
a
determination--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
i
submit
that
they
were
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
because
of
the
fact--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
what
montana-dakota
stands
for,
of
course,
is
that
the
filed
rates
are--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes,
and
you're
right,
justice
rehnquist,
this
is
an
extension
of
the
montana-dakota,
of
the
montana-dakota
principle.
it
is
a
correct
extension,
i
submit,
for
these
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
very
purpose
of
part
two
of
the
federal
power
act
was
to
close
the
attleboro
gap
and
to
eliminate
the
overlap
between
the
possible
competing
between
state
and
federal
jurisdictions,
and
to
best...
and
to
give
the
wholesale
regulatory
authority
to
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission,
than
the
federal
power
commission,
because
of
the
fact
that
this
court
in
attleboro
had
held
that
the
states
did
not
have
it.
in
the
event
that
the
states
could
then
come
along
and,
once
these
power
supply
costs
had
been
determined
at
wholesale,
could
say,
we
disagree
with
them
at
the
retail
rate,
it
would
simply
permit
the
states
to
do
by
indirection
what
they
cannot
do
directly,
and
that
is
to
in
effect
overturn
ferc's
determination
for
the
only
purpose
that
really
matters.
the
purpose
that
really
matters
for
the
allocation
of
these
entitlements
and
therefore
the
allocation
of
the
purchases
is
in
the
setting
of
retail
rates.
as
tennessee
points
out
in
its
amicus
brief,
if
north
carolina
can
do
what
it
has
purported
to
do,
what
it
has
attempted
to
do
in
this
case,
that
is
to
key
the
amount
of
its
entitlements
to
what
it
needs,
rather
than
to
ferc's
determinations,
there
is
no
reason
that
tennessee
couldn't
do
the
same.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
the
question
of
the
procedure
that
can
be
used,
that
is
whether
it
can
pierce
the
corporate
veil,
whether
it
can
use
this
toll-in.
my
answer
to
that
is
that
the
question
of
whether
north
carolina
can
pierce
the
corporate
veil
is
irrelevant
to
this
case.
it
adds
nothing
to
the
analysis,
for
this
reason.
if
we're
right
that
narraganset-northern
states
is
good
law,
then
it
follows
that
the
only
allocation
that
the
states
can
use
is
the
allocation
that
was
used
by
ferc.
and
if
we're
not
right,
then
the
only
issue,
of
course,
is
narragansett-northern
states.
but
if
we
are
correct,
then
north
carolina
must
use
that
allocation
in
determining
its
revenue
requirements.
so
that
the
only
relevant
question
is
whether
narragansett
is
good
law.
we
submit
that
it
is,
for
reasons
that
i've
just
discussed.
the
appellees'
argument
that,
because
ferc
made
one
modification
to
the
apportionment
agreement,
this
somehow
frees
north
carolina
to
make
any
allocations
that
it
wants
notwithstanding
what
ferc
has
done
is
a
complete
non
sequitur.
if
ferc
is
to
do
its
job
as
a
regulator,
then
it
must
make
whatever
adjustments
in
the
rate
schedules
it
considers
necessary
to
achieve
just
and
reasonable
rates.
but
when
it
does
so...
excuse
me,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
you
might
quarrel...
a
quarrel
might
be
had
with
the
language
that
ferc
used.
but
the
argument
that
because
ferc
did
or
did
not
modify
the
filed
rate
would
simply
work
to
my
clients'
benefit
rather
than
north
carolina's
benefit,
for
this
reason.
if
it
in
fact
was
not
a
modification,
then
the
original
filed
rate
was
still
in
effect,
because
the
modification
favored
north
carolina
rather
than
my
clients.
and
nobody
can
contend
that
the
original
filed
rate
was
not
still
in
effect.
moreover,
it
is
quite
clear
to
me,
though
this
is
actually
against
my
clients'
own
self-interest,
that
ferc
did
in
fact
modify
the
agreement,
because
its
job
was
to
set
a
just
and
reasonable
rate.
in
order
to
do
that,
it
concluded
that
it
had
to
give
additional
power,
additional
cheap
entitlement
power,
to
nantahala.
once
it
did
so,
that
modification
of
the
agreement
became
the
new
filed
rate,
or
in
any
event
the
new
ferc
decision
that
was
then
binding
on
the
north
carolina
courts.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
what
the
appellees
are
asking
this
court
to
do,
and
the
only
thing
they're
asking
this
court
to
do,
is
to
perform
the
function
of
deciding
what
is
a
fair
and
just
allocation
of
these
entitlements.
that
is
not
the
function
of
this
court.
it
is
not
the
issue
before
this
court.
that
is
a
decision
that
has
already
been
made
by
the
only
authority
that
has
the
power
to
make
it,
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission.
it
can
be
asserted
on
the
one
side
that
it's
a
nasty
picture,
a
terrible
thing
by
a
corporate
giant.
it
can
be
asserted
on
the
other
side,
as
we
have
quoted
in
our
brief,
that
alcoa
is
the
best
friend
that
north
carolina
ever
had.
these
are
the
lowest
rates
in
north
carolina.
this
court
is
not
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission.
the
only
issue
for
this
court
is
who
is
going
to
call
these
balls
and
strikes.
is
it
going
to
be
a
neutral
umpire,
or
is
it
going
to
be
the
catcher,
or
is
it
going
to
be
the
batter?
the
only
facts
that
the
appellees
say
are
relevant
to
this
case
are
all,
every
one...
count
them...
facts
that
pertain
to
their
allegations
of
unfairness.
it
is
not
the
proper
function
of
this
court
and
it
would
be
a
misallocation
of
this
court's
resources
to
sift
through
those.
our
point
is
that
there
is
a
filed
rate.
it
is
the
nfa
and
the
apportionment
agreement,
and
that
controls
unless
and
until
it
is
modified.
once
it
is
modified,
then
it
is
the
modified
version
that
must
control.
and
the
only
alternative
is
the
kind
of
chaos
that
led
to,
200
years
ago,
the
invocation
of
a
constitutional
convention.
in
the
event
that
the
court
should
not
decide
this
case
on
that
ground,
then
in
must
reach
the
commerce
clause
issue.
and
there
is
no
question
that
this
case
is
indistinguishable
from
what
happened
in
nepco.
the
better
procedure,
we
submit,
is
to
follow
the
lead
of
the
state
supreme
court
decisions
which
have
held
that,
where
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
has
made
a
power
supply
cost
determination,
that
that
power
supply
cost
determination
then
becomes
binding
on
the
state
and
local
regulators
when
they
make
their
retail
ratemaking
decisions.
unless
the
court
has
questions,
i
have
nothing
further.
