justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
is
tapoco
located,
mr.
lee?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
far
from
the
border?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
is
north
carolina
bound
by
that?
they
weren't
a
party
to
that
proceeding.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
i
realize
that.
but
so
ferc's
decision
was
upheld
and
north
carolina
can't
challenge
that.
but
why
is
the
north
carolina
commission
bound
by
ferc's
resolution
of
this
issue?
i
mean,
this
isn't
the
filed
rate
doctrine
at
all.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
we're
not
bound
by
those
state
supreme
court
decisions.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
on
this
particular
point?
i
mean,
certainly
montana-dakota
doesn't
stand
for
this
proposition
at
all.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
you
can't
relitigate
in
a
federal
district
court
the
reasonableness
of
the
fpc's
ruling.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
i
thought
the
issue
you
were
answering
me
on
was
whether
north
carolina
can
sort
of
pierce
this
corporate
veil
in
some
way,
which
wouldn't
go
to
that
general
proposition
you
just
mentioned
at
all,
i
would
think.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
appellants
of
course
say
that
this
was
all
concluded
in
the
proceedings
before
ferc,
that
it's
too
late
for
you
now.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
justice.
[laughter]
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
position
of
the
appellants
is
that
by
the
sort
of
rate
structure
and
redefinition
of
rates
that
your
commission
put
on
nantahala
and
tapoco,
you
have
in
effect
disregarded
the
wholesale
allocation.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
considered
their
federal
questions--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
why
are
you
bringing
this
up?
