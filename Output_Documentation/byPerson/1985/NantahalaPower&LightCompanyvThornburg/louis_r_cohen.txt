mr.
louis
r.
cohen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
recognized
that
the
new
fontana
agreement
and
the
1971
apportionment
agreement
were
contracts
filed
with
and
accepted
by
ferc
setting
forth
terms
for
the
sale
of
power
at
wholesale
in
interstate
commerce;
and
that
the
north
carolina
utilities
commission
was...
and
i'll
quote
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
because
the
point
can't
be
said
any
better...
"was
preempted
from
inquiring
into
the
reasonableness
of
those
ferc
filed
rates
when
it
acts
in
fixing
nantahala's
retail
rate.
"
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
had,
however,
two
defenses
for
what
the
north
carolina
utilities
commission
did.
first,
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
said
that
the
state
commission
was
not
questioning
the
ferc
filed
allocation
of
low
cost
power,
that
is
to
say
the
terms
on
which
nantahala
acquired
power
at
wholesale,
but
was
merely
determining
what
costs
could
properly
be
imposed
on
retail
customers.
it
analogized
cases
where
state
utility
commissions
have
accepted
the
wholesale
cost,
but
found
that
a
particular
wholesale
cost
was
offset
by
savings
elsewhere
or
was,
as
in
for
example
the
case
of
a
research
cost,
not
a
particular
cost
that
ought
to
be
imposed
on
particular
retail
customers,
or
cases
where
state
commissions
have
found
that
power
purchase
costs
were
unreasonable
because
power
could
have
been
acquired
more
cheaply
from
a
different
available
source.
none
of
those
things
is
what
the
north
carolina
utilities
commission
did
here.
what
it
did
here,
as
stated
by
the
north
carolina
supreme
court...
i'm
at
page
15a
of
the
joint
appendix...
was
to
find
that
significant
detriments
and
inequities
to
nantahala
arise
out
of
the
new
fontana
agreement
and
the
1971
apportionment
agreement,
and
render
use
of
the
company's
cost
allocation
formula
based
on
the
demand
and
energy
entitlements
under
those
contracts
inappropriate
for
determining
the
costs
fairly
attributable
to
the
north
carolina
public
load.
in
other
words,
the
state
commission
simply
substituted
a
different
and
what
it
thought
would
be
fairer
arrangement
among
the
same
parties
with
respect
to
dividing
the
low
cost
power,
instead
of
the
1971
agreement
and
instead
of
ferc's
determination
of
a
proper
apportionment
after
ferc
had
reviewed
that
agreement.
let
me
comment
briefly
on
a
distinction
between
two
allocation
decisions
that
north
carolina
made.
north
carolina
decided
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
roll
in,
to
combine
the
two
utilities'
costs
for
purposes
of
determining
now
their
costs...
what
their
costs
were
of
producing
power.
that
is
not
the
major
problem
with
what
north
carolina
did,
and
it
would
not
necessarily
conflict
with
either
the
filed
agreements
or
the
ferc
modification.
what
north
carolina
did
that
creates
the
problem
here
was
to
apportion
the
entitlements
power
that
the
two
utilities
received
back
from
tva
in
a
way
that
different
both
with
their
contractual
apportionment
and
with
the
apportionment
that
ferc
found
to
be
fair.
in
sum,
i
think
north
carolina
was
doing
precisely
what
the
supreme
court
had
acknowledged
it
could
not
do,
and
that
was
altering
the
terms
of
the
wholesale
transaction.
now,
the
north
carolina
court's
second
line
of
defense
was
that
the
ferc
proceedings
themselves
somehow
freed
the
utilities
commission
to
do
what
it
did.
the
argument
is
that
ferc
found
the
apportionment
unfair,
but
failed
to
modify
it,
and
thus
conferred
the
power
on
north
carolina
to
determine
nantahala's
wholesale
costs
as
it
saw
fit.
i
think
that's
wrong
for
two
reasons,
apart
from
the
commerce
clause
problem
that
would
be
presented.
first,
ferc
had
accepted
the
two
agreements
for
filing,
and
north
carolina
was
bound
to
honor
the
apportionment
set
forth
in
those
agreements
unless
and
until
they
were
modified.
north
carolina
had
a
statutory
right
to
challenge
the
rates,
the
apportionment,
at
ferc
or
to
ask
ferc
to
clarify
if
there
were
any
doubt
that
the
adjustment
ferc
made
in
favor
of
nantahala
could
be
assumed
for
retail
rate
setting
purposes
at
all.
the
north
carolina
attorney
general
did
participate
at
ferc
on
behalf
of
north
carolina's
retail
customers,
but
he
didn't
like
the
outcome
at
ferc,
and
so
north
carolina
took
the
matter
into
its
own
hands
and
simply
fixed
its
own
apportionment.
north
carolina
was
bound
to
honor
the
agreements
until
they
were
modified.
second,
while
the
opinions
are
not
models
of
clarity,
i
think
there
is
no
real
doubt
that
ferc
did
modify
nantahala's
entitlements
for
all
purposes,
including
retail
rate
setting.
ferc
said
when
it
accepted
the
1971
agreement
for
filing,
266a:
"the
reasonableness
of
the
apportionment
arrangements
shall
be
subject
to
the
outcome
of
the
proceedings.
"
ferc
said
in
opinion
139,
the
key
document
here,
at
page
298:
"the
effect
of
this
opinion
is
to
provide
entitlements
to
nantahala
which
will
result
in
just
and
reasonable
rates
to
its
wholesale
customers.
"
there
is
a
reference
to
wholesale
customers.
but
there
is
no
excuse
for
reading
ferc's
statement
that
it
is
providing
certain
entitlements
to
mean
instead
that
it
is
assuming
entitlements
for
one
purpose
only.
of
course,
any
doubt
on
this
point
could
have
been
resolved
in
the
ferc
proceedings
by
the
north
carolina
attorney
general
and
by
the
town
of
highlands,
which
were
there.
there
are
statements
in
the
ferc
opinions
to
the
effect
that
ferc
is
not
reforming
the
contract,
but
reforming
contracts
is
not
a
normal
ferc
activity.
as
this
court
explained
in
the
mobile
and
sierra
case,
ferc's
basic
task
is
to
review
rates,
which
may
or
may
not
be
embodied
in
private
contracts,
and,
if
it
determines
that
they
are
not
just
and
reasonable,
to
set
just
and
reasonable
rates.
and
i
think
it
is
reasonably
clear
that
that
is
what
ferc
did
here,
and
it
accepted
the
1971
agreement
and
then
expressly
made
the
reasonableness
of
the
apportionment
arrangement
subject
to
the
outcome
of
the
then
pending
proceedings.
and
in
those
proceedings,
it
then
modified
nantahala's
entitlement.
the
reformation
question
came
up
in
connection
with
highlands'
request
that
ferc
alter
the
obligation
to
tapoco,
the
tennessee
utility,
which
the
administrative
law
judge
declined
to
do
because
highlands
had
not
made
out
a
prima
facie
case
that
tapoco
had
benefited.
that's
where
that
question
first
arose.
then
when
both
sides,
in
what
ferc
said
were
confusing
contentions,
raised
issues
about
retroactivity
and
whether
ferc
was
impermissibly
retroactively
changing
rates,
ferc
said,
we
have
not
modified
the
contract,
we
have
merely
acted
on
the
nantahala
wholesale
rate
filing
which
has
been
open
since
it
was
filed
in
1976.
but
ferc's
1980
order
had
included
the
1971
filing
as
well.
