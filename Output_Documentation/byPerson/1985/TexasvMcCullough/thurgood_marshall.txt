justice

marshall
--the
other
ground
was
remorse.
that
was
in
the
first
trial
and
the
second
trial,
i
guess.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
not
too
sure
it
is
a
ground
for
increasing
somebody's
sentence.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
judge
did
use
it
for
that
purpose.
justice

marshall
so,
since
she
didn't
have
the
right
to
do
it
the
first
time,
all
she
had
to
do
was
grant
a
new
trial?
