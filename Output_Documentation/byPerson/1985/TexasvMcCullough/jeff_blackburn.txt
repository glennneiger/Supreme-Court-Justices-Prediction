mr.
jeff
blackburn
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
first
like
to
address
some
of
the
issues
raised
by
the
question
as
to
whether
the
presumption
established
by
pearce
should
apply
to
the
peculiar
facts
of
this
case.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
has
raised
first
and
foremost
the
issue
concerning
the
election
that
defendants
can
make
in
our
state
as
to
whether
jury
or
judge
may
assess
punishment.
first,
i
would
like
to
note
that
we
argue,
and
quite
forcefully,
that
this
court
absolutely
cannot
consider
this
issue.
our
state
court,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
has
already
made
a
binding
decision
as
to
a
matter
of
state
law
by
way
of
construing
the
statute
created
by
our
legislature,
article
3707,
and
in
that
construction
has
told
the
court
that
our
legislature
has
made
a
determination
that
defendant
should
be
able
to
make
the
choice
to
elect
between
judge
or
jury
for
sentencing,
free
of
any
vindictiveness.
in
our
interpretation,
that
is
a
conclusive
determination,
a
construction
of
a
state
statute,
and
because
of
that,
this
court
will
be
bound
by
it.
if
the
merits
of
the
argument
can
be
considered
anyway,
several
things
need
to
be
noted.
i
think
that
to
really
understand
our
position
on
this
question
of
jury
election
it
is
important
to
look
at
the
decisions
a
trial
lawyer
in
texas
who
is
defending
a
criminal
defendant
has
to
make.
because
of
the
operation
of
the
rules
of
evidence,
trial
lawyers
have
to
make
certain
decisions
as
to
which
sentencing
body
they
deride
to
elect
on
behalf
of
their
clients.
if
a
defendant
elects
to
be
punished
by
a
jury,
it
means
that
he
is
going
to
be
bound
by
certain
rules
of
evidence,
as
to
what
he
can
put
in
evidence.
for
example,
a
jury
can
only
consider
certain
things
in
the
state
of
texas
because
only
certain
items
of
evidence
are
admissible
before,
the
prior
criminal
record
of
the
defendant--
mr.
jeff
blackburn
--yes,
justice
rehnquist.
there
is
a...
we
have
a
bifurcated
trial
system.
regardless
whether
you
elect
judge
or
jury,
there
is
always
going
to
be
a
separate
sentencing
hearing.
mr.
jeff
blackburn
yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
if
a
defendant
elects
to
go
before
the
jury
in
a
sentencing
hearing,
he
can
put
on
evidence,
or
the
state
can
present
evidence
of
his
prior
criminal
record,
his
reputation
in
the
community,
and
the
jury
can
consider
the
facts
of
the
offense.
under
our
rules
of
evidence,
that's
all
the
jury
can
consider.
if
he
elects
to
go
in
front
of
the
judge
and
have
the
judge
assess
punishment,
he
can
put
on
a
great
deal
more
information.
for
example,
we
have
a
system
whereby
defendants
can
have
a
pre-sentence
investigation
conducted,
very
similar
to
the
federal
system.
that
can
be
considered
by
the
judge.
opinion
testimony
about
the
nature
and
character
of
the
defendant
can
be
considered
by
the
judge.
none
of
these
things
can
be
brought
forward
under
the
rules
of
evidence
if
a
defendant
elects
to
go
in
front
of
the
jury.
so,
you
see,
the
choice
as
to
be
made
based
on
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
each
particular
case.
it's
a
difficult
decision
for
every
defendant
in
texas
to
make.
the
problem
with
the
argument
advanced
by
the
petitioner
is
that
they
would
create
a
new
consideration
for
defendants,
and
that
consideration
would
be
whether
the
judge
would
possibly
be
motivated
by
feelings
of
retaliation
and
vindictiveness.
if
this
argument
is
accepted,
vindictiveness
is
going
to
become
a
factor
in
making
the
decision
as
to
whether
judge
or
jury
should
be
selected
to
assess
punishment.
now,
the
import
of
north
carolina
versus
pearce,
according
to
our
reading
of
that
decision,
is
that
vindictiveness
should
play
absolutely
no
role
whatsoever
in
the
criminal
trial
process.
pearce
sought
to
abolish
vindictiveness
completely
and
absolutely.
this
argument
begins
to
resurrect
the
spectre
of
vindictiveness.
it
begins
to
make
vindictiveness
play
a
certain
role
in
the
whole
process
of
criminal
trials.
because
of
that,
it
should
be
rejected
as
a
procedural
distinction
that
somehow
removes
a
texas
case
from
the
ambit
of
north
carolina
versus
pearce.
mr.
jeff
blackburn
i
don't
think
that
would
make
a
difference
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
the
actual
person
of
the
sentencing
judge
would
have
any
role
in
whether
the
sentence
could
be--
mr.
jeff
blackburn
--judge,
i'm
basing
my
analysis
on
the
approach
created
by
the
cases
construing
north
carolina
versus
pearce.
pearce,
as
i
recall...
there
was
a
different
judge
involved.
it's
not
so
much
the
individual
judge.
it's,
rather,
some
of
the
institutional
biases
that
a
judge
in
that
particular
institutional
position
can
develop.
mr.
jeff
blackburn
no,
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
think
that
was
noted
in
subsequent
cases,
hardwick
versus
doolittle
and
certain
others,
that
the
actual
sentencing
judge
was
different.
mr.
jeff
blackburn
i
believe
it
was,
in
hardwick
versus
doolittle,
but
i'm
not
certain
about
that,
your
honor.
mr.
jeff
blackburn
yes,
sir.
mr.
jeff
blackburn
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
if
he
had
elected
on
the
second
trial
to
be
sentenced
by
the
jury,
the
jury,
assuming
that
they
had
no
knowledge
of
the
prior
sentence,
could
have
given
him
whatever
they
felt
as
just
and
proper
under
the
circumstances.
i
don't
think
there
would
have
been
any
limitation.
mr.
jeff
blackburn
i
think
that
would
be
the
burden
of
the
defendant
in
that
particular
case,
your
honor.
mr.
jeff
blackburn
that's
true.
i
think
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
defendants
to
prove
that.
mr.
jeff
blackburn
no,
justice
powell.
i
think
that
it
would
be
very
difficult,
and
it
would
take
a
great
deal
more
facts,
to
show
vindictiveness
on
the
part
of
a
jury
in
that
kind
of
a
situation.
i
think
if
a
defendant
elects
to
have
a
jury
assess
punishment
on
the
second
trial,
the
likelihood
of
vindictiveness
truly
is
de
minimis,
and
under
those
circumstances,
and
given
the
court's
reasoning
in
chaffin,
the
pearce
rule
would
not
be
engaged
and
the
presumption
would
not
apply.
the
second
question
that
the
state
has
raised
is
the
idea
that
because
the
judge
granted
a
new
trial
on
motion
of
the
defendant,
and
that
because
of
the
procedural
situation
of
the
case
involving
as
it
did
a
motion
for
new
trial
rather
than
a
direct
appeal
to
a
higher
tribunal,
the
argument
goes
that
this
so
far
removes
this
case
from
the
ambit
of
pearce
that
the
presumption
of
vindictiveness
should
not
be
engaged.
there
is
no
functional
difference
between
a
defendant
who
is
alleging
error
on
the
part
of
the
trial
judge
and
seeking
a
new
trial
through
the
device
of
a
motion
for
new
trial
in
texas.
there
is
no
functional
difference
between
the
defendant
in
that
circumstance
and
a
defendant
who
is
filing
a
direct
appeal
alleging
error
on
the
part
of
a
trial
judge.
we
would
urge
that
this
court
adopt
the
reasoning
set
forth
by
the
eleventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
united
states
versus
monaco
in
which
that
court
held
that
because
a
defendant
had
the
right
to
exercise
the
right
to
move
for
a
new
trial
without
fear
of
vindictiveness,
the
mere
fact
of
filing
a
motion
for
new
trial
or
gaining
retrial
upon
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
is
a
distinction
without
difference.
we
would
urge
the
court
to
adopt
the
reasoning
of
the
eleventh
circuit
on
that
matter.
the
other
distinguishing
factor
that
the
state
has
posited
in
their
briefs
is
that
because
a
jury
imposed
the
first
sentence
here
and
the
judge
imposed
the
second,
the
judge
had
no
personal
stake
in
the
outcome
of
the
proceedings.
consequently
the
realistic
likelihood
of
vindictiveness,
if
any,
would
be
de
minimis.
we
would
just
point
out
in
response
to
that
argument
that
the
judge
has
certainly
the
same
personal
and
institutional
stake
in
the
sanctity
of
his
decision
and
in
the
outcome
of
the
case
that
he
would
in
any
other
circumstance.
we
don't
believe
that
to
be
a
sufficient
distinguishing
factor
to
bring
this
case
outside
the
ambit
of
pearce.
mr.
jeff
blackburn
u.s.
versus
monaco.
mr.
jeff
blackburn
yes,
sir.
mr.
jeff
blackburn
yes,
sir.
mr.
jeff
blackburn
the
second
major
problem
created
by
this
case
is
the
sufficiency
of
the
trial
court's
findings
and
whether
or
not
those
findings
were...
and
should
be
used
to
increase
the
sentence
in
this
case.
not
only
were
all
of
these
findings
related
on
evidence
that
was
new
and
did
not
occur
or
develop
in
between
the
trials,
but
the
record
is
very
important
and
should
be
analyzed
in
this
case.
not
a
single
one
of
the
findings
relied
on
by
the
trial
court
involved
evidence
that
had
come
out
the
first
time
at
the
second
trial.
all
of
that
evidence
had
been
presented
in
one
fashion
or
another
at
the
first
trial
and
a
reading
of
the
record
bears
that
assertion
out.
every
bit
of
it
had
come
out
in
one
form
or
another
at
the
first
trial.
this
is
not
a
case
where
new
information
has
come
to
light,
even
at
the
second
trial.
this
is
not
even
a
case
where
the
facts
would
fit
in
within
the
approach
advocated
by
mr.
justice
white
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
pearce.
that
approach,
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
was
that
the
trial
judge
should
be
able
to
rely
on
any
new,
objective
data
concerning
the
defendant.
this
was
not
new
data.
furthermore,
the
other
findings
made
by
the
court
are
not
even
objective
in
nature.
first
of
all,
there's
the
problem
of
no
remorse
shown
by
the
defendant.
certainly
that
cannot
be
considered
as
an
objective
finding.
secondly,
there
is
a
finding
that
the
defendant
never
exhibited
a
desire
to
rehabilitate
himself,
and
that
was
not
proven.
in
conclusion,
then,
on
that
matter,
the
findings
entered
by
the
trial
court
here
were
utterly
insufficient
to
justify
a
sentence
increase.
first
of
all,
they
were
not
new
data.
second
of
all,
they
were
not
objective
information
of
the
sort
contemplated
even
by
some
of
the
views
expressed
in
the
wasman
case.
because
of
this,
this
case
does
not
present
an
issue
of
temporal
limitation
in
the
application
of
the
pearce
doctrine.
this
is
not
new
information.
this
case
does
not
present
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
court
should
be
allowed...
or
the
trial
court
should
be
allowed
to
consider
information
that
is
brought
out
upon
a
retrial,
because
all
of
this
information--
mr.
jeff
blackburn
--no,
sir.
the
position
taken
by
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
incidentally,
on
this
matter,
on
the
sufficiency
of
findings,
was
that
the
state
had
abandoned
this
claim
before
them.
this
claim
was
never
even
placed
before
the
court
of
criminal
appeals.
incidentally,
we
urge
that
as
a
further
reason
for
the
court
not
to
consider
this
issue
now
as
it
is
being
raised
by
the
state.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
in
their
opinion,
expressly
pointed
out
that
the
state
had
never
contended
in
that
court
that
these
findings
were
ever
sufficient
to
justify
the
sentence
increase.
instead,
they
relied
on
the
arguments
that
we
had
discussed
previously.
the
problem
with
this
case
is
that
it
does
not
present
squarely
before
the
court
the
issue
of
temporal
limitation,
because
all
of
the
facts
that
were
relied
on
here
by
the
judge,
insofar
as
there
were
ever
objective
facts,
were
not
new
facts.
they
were
all
facts
that
had
been
produced
at
the
first
trial.
there
is
not
a
single
finding
in
this
record
that
could
reasonably
be
construed
as
being
new
information
that
had
only
come
to
light
at
the
second
trial.
because
of
that,
we
feel
that
this
case
does
not
present
the
issue
of
temporal
limitation,
and
that
this
case
should
not
be
used...
that
this
case
should
not
be
considered
as
one
that
presents
that
issue
squarely
before
the
court
because
it
just
simply
doesn't.
mr.
jeff
blackburn
that's
correct,
judge,
but
that
was
in
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
that's
an
intermediate
appellate
court
in
our
state.
mr.
jeff
blackburn
yes,
justice
rehnquist.
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
is
the
ultimate
court
of
last
resort
in
criminal
cases
in
our
state,
and
in
that
court's
opinion
it
was
noted
that
the
state
had
abandoned
the
claim
that
these
findings
were
sufficient
to
justify
the
sentence
increase.
