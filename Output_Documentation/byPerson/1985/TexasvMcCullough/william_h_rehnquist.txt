justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
do
have
to
disapprove
or
not
follow
certain
dicta
in
pearce
to
reach
the
result
you
want,
don't
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
a
separate
sentencing
hearing
when
you
have
a
sentence
by
a
jury
in
texas?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
you
are
talking
about
now
is
the
sort
of
evidence
that
is
allowed
to
go
before
the
jury
in
the
sentencing
hearing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
court
didn't...
in
pearce
didn't
even
mention
in
its
opinion
the
fact
that
there
was
a
different
judge,
did
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
the
courts'
opinions
in
those
cases,
was
that
noted?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
not...
the
position
you
are
now
espousing
was
not
the
position
taken
by
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
was
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
let
me
call
your
attention,
counsel,
to
justice
countis's
opinion
on
the
motion
for
re-hearing,
which
i
have
as
pages
a-8
and
a-9
in
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
and
if
you
would
take
a
look
at
the
penultimate
paragraph
of
the
opinion,
it
seems
to
me
you
can
say
that
in
the
rehearing
opinion,
they
did
treat
the
issue
that
you
were
just
talking
about.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
see.
so,
there's
a
difference
between
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
court
of
criminal
appeals?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
"the
other
thing".
what
is
the
thing
that
isn't
the
other
thing?
you
were
saying,
your
petition
for
review
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
was
denied.
what
follows
from
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
performance?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
never
wrote
any
opinion
in
the
case
except
the
one
about
saying
that
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
have
the
power
to
reform
the
sentence?
