justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
you
just
there
for
a
moment,
please,
with
a
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
there
were
no
new
information
brought
out
at
the
second
trial,
the
only
thing
that
was
different
was
the
defendant
said,
well,
this
time
i'll
have
the
judge
fix
the
sentence,
would
the
judge
then
in
your
view
have
been
free
to
impose
a
higher
sentence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
the
judge
just
said,
"well,
if
i'd
been
the
sentencing
authority
the
first
time.
"
as
i
believe
she
did,
she
said,
"i
would
have
imposed
more
than
20
years.
"
"now
i
have
a
chance
to
do
it
so
i'll
do
it.
"
you
would
say
that
would
be
perfectly
proper?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
there?
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
argued...
it
seems
to
me
that
defendant
would
always
be
exposed
to
the
risk
of
increased
punishment
because
the
jury
would
be
a
different
sentencing
authority
from
the
first
jury,
and
under
your
view
the
judge
is
a
different
sentencing
authority
from
the
first
jury,
so
neither
of
them
would
be
limited
by
the
sentence.
so,
if
your
argument
is
correct,
really,
it's
open
season
on
the
new
sentence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
wonder
if
this
is...
would
it
have
been
permissible
for
the
trial
judge
to
grant
a
new
trial
because
she
was
convinced
the
sentence
was
wholly
inadequate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
she
really
thought
that
they
ought
to
try
it
over
and
impose
a
proper
sentence?
