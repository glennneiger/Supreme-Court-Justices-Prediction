mr.
randall
l.
sherrod
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
the
outset
i
would
like
to
go
over
a
couple
of
facts
that
i
think
is
necessary
in
the
analysis
of
this
important
case.
first
of
all,
texas
has
a
bifurcated
trial
system.
prior
to
a
trial
a
defendant
has
a
right
to
elect
whether
a
judge
or
a
jury
will
assess
punishment
in
a
given
case.
the
respondent
at
his
first
trial
in
this
case
was
tried
by
a
jury
and
found
guilty
of
murder,
having
previously
filed
an
election
to
have
a
jury
assess
punishment.
the
jury
assessed
punishment
at
20
years'
confinement.
respondent
filed
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
with
the
same
trial
judge.
the
motion
was
granted
by
that
judge.
a
second
jury
again
found
the
respondent
guilty
of
murder.
prior
to
the
trial
a
motion
had
been
filed,
this
time
alleging
that
the
judge
should
be
the
one
that
would
assess
punishment,
and
of
course
we
think
that
is
very
significant.
the
same
judge
at
the
second
trial
assessed
50
years'
confinement,
and
at
the
request
of
the
defendant
in
this
particular
case
the
trial
judge
also
entered
specific
findings
of
fact
on
why
the
50
years'
sentence
was
given
by
the
court
at
the
second
trial.
of
course,
i
think
from
looking
at
the
specific
facts
that
we
are
discussing
in
this
case,
there's
two
rather
general
questions
that
need
to
be
answered
by
the
court.
the
first
question
is,
does
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
require
the
presumption
of
vindictiveness
enacted
in
north
carolina
versus
pearce
upon
retrial
of
a
criminal
case,
or
do
any
of
the
following
three
areas
that
i
would
like
to
discuss
render
the
reasonable
likelihood
of
vindictiveness,
as
the
court
has
said,
de
minimis.
first
of
all,
i
think
that
the
most
important
and
the
strongest
allegation
that
the
state
has
is
the
very
fact
that
the
defendant
in
this
particular
kind
of
case,
pursuant
to
texas
law,
has
the
absolute
right
to
determine
which
sentencing
authority
will
have
the
power
to
assess
the
punishment
at
the
second
trial.
i
think
that's
extremely
important.
when
you're
discussing
that
particular
element
of
the
question,
i
think
it's
important
to
recall
pearce
and
understand
and
pearce
basically
stands
for
the
proposition
that
punishment
assessed
upon
retrial
of
a
criminal
case
should
not
be
set
in
a
certain
amount
because
of
vindictiveness
of
the
sentencing
authority
toward
a
defendant
for
exercising
his
right
to
appeal.
vindictiveness,
as
the
court
has
said,
should
have
no
place
in
setting
punishment
upon
retrial.
a
presumption
of
vindictiveness
in
pearce
was
established
because
of
the
possible
chilling
effect
a
retaliatory
motive
could
have
upon
a
defendant's
exercise
of
his
legal
right
to
appeal.
the
presumption
of
vindictiveness
is
not
required
solely
because
of
the
possibility
of
a
greater
sentence
that
may
possibly
be
assessed
upon
retrial.
neither
does
the
possibility
of
vindictiveness
alone
require
a
presumption
of
vindictiveness.
the
presumption
of
vindictiveness
has
been
held
to
apply
only
where
there
is
a
reasonable
likelihood
of
vindictiveness,
and
i
think
when
the
court
looks
at
colton,
caffin,
bordenkercher
and
goodwin,
that
that's
the
interpretation
that
would
now
stand
concerning
the
pearce
presumption
of
vindictiveness.
the
presumption
of
vindictiveness
was
enacted
by
this
court
to
protect
against
the
chilling
effect
of
retaliatory
motivation
in
assessing
punishment
when
a
defendant
has
basically
exercised
his
right
to
appeal,
not
the
fact
that
vindictiveness
may
occur,
but
for
the
retaliatory
vindictiveness
that
may
occur
by
a
trial
judge
at
a
second
trial.
when
we
look
at
the
most
common
application
of
pearce,
i
think
the
validity
is
still
there.
you
take
a
situation
where
a
defendant
is
tried
the
first
time
and
a
trial
judge
assesses
punishment,
and
you
take
the
fact
that
he
exercises
his
right
of
appeal
and
that
he
receives
a
second
trial.
when
you
consider
the
fact
that
if
the
judge
assesses
punishment
greater
than
what
he
assessed
at
the
first
trial,
there's
only
two
reasonable
reasons
that
the
court
should
consider
motivated
that
increase,
in
sentence.
of
course,
the
first
one
is
obviously
that
he
was
retaliating
against
the
defendant
for
exercising
his
right
of
appeal.
the
second
option
may
be
that
the
second
trial
has
brought
to
light
additional
evidence
that
may
in
fact
justify
an
increase
in
the
punishment.
now,
the
rationale
in
pearce
and
those
particular
cases
is
still
very
valid,
and
there's
a
reason
for
it
and
it
still
applies,
and
that
reason
is
that
if
in
fact
there
was
no
retaliatory
motive,
it's
not
too
difficult
for
the
court
to
place
a
list
of
those
reasons
upon
the
record.
so,
under
those
facts--
mr.
randall
l.
sherrod
--i
think
you
do,
sir,
yes.
specifically
in
a
case
like
this
when
the
defendant
has
the
option
of
filing
at
the
second
point,
the
only
reason
for
filing
to
the
judge
in
the
second
point,
rather
than
the
fact
that
he
may
be
trying
to
exercise
or
protect
one
of
his
constitutional
rights,
i
submit
to
you
is
more
that
he
is
trying
to
seek
a
windfall.
he
is
trying
to
limit
the
second
court
from
considering
evidence
or
exercising
its
discretion
for
the
first
time
in
what
may
in
fact
be
a
fair
sentence.
now,
when
you
analyze
this
very
closely,
what
you
see
is
that
the
application
of
pearce
in
states
like
texas
actually
results
in
a
chilling
effect
upon
a
defendant
to
go
to
a
jury
to
have
that
jury
determine
punishment.
mr.
randall
l.
sherrod
yes,
sir.
i
believe
under
wasman
that
it
basically
has,
and
also
under
interpretations
given
strictly
under
pearce
because
there
is
two
provisions
in
there
that
rather
conflict.
i
believe
wasman
indicates
that
that
has
in
fact
occurred,
and
that's
the
second
issue
that
the
court
can
consider
in
this
particular
case,
and
of
course
that
would
be
whether
there
was
sufficient
evidence
presented
on
the
record
that
would
justify
an
increase
in
sentence
based
upon
wasman
and
its
interpretation
of
the
pearce
doctrine.
the
second
area
that
i
think
very
important--
mr.
randall
l.
sherrod
--yes,
sir.
mr.
randall
l.
sherrod
every
one
of
the
facts
that
would
justify
an
increase
in
sentence
did
in
fact
occur
prior
to
the
first
trial,
but
i
think
what's
important
in
this
case,
and
the
information
that
contains
in
wasman,
and
where
we
need
further
definition
and
a
little
guidance,
is
whether
or
not
the
increase
in
the
word
from
"conduct"
to
"events"
that
was
established
in
wasman
indicates
that
it's
events
that
come
to
light
at
the
second
trial.
i
think
when
you
look
at
the
rationale
in
the
protections
that
pearce
is
meant
to
apply
to,
you
see
that
there
is
no
reason
that
the
court
or
the
sentencing
authority
at
the
second
trial
should
be
automatically
limited
from
assessing
what
they
feel
is
a
fair
punishment,
and
when
you
look
at
the
application
of
pearce,
and
the
application
that
the
state
of
texas...
that
has
resulted
in
their
literal
application
of
pearce,
you
see
situations
like
this
where
the
court
of
appeals
judge
says
that
it's
rather
unfair
that
there
is
no
evidence
of
vindictiveness
in
this
case.
and
yet,
because
we
must
follow
the
application
of
north
carolina
versus
pearce
and
the
literal
interpretation
of
that,
that
when
a
judge
assesses
the
punishment
at
the
second
trial
that
under
those
facts
there
is
a
limit
upon
the
sentence,
that
it
can
result
in
unjust
sentencing.
mr.
randall
l.
sherrod
yes,
sir.
mr.
randall
l.
sherrod
yes,
sir,
and
i
believe
for
two
reasons,
and
we
have
alleged
three.
of
course,
the
first
one
is
the
fact
that
the
defendant
has
the
option
of
electing
who
sets
punishment.
it
seems
rather
unusual
that--
mr.
randall
l.
sherrod
--yes,
sir.
mr.
randall
l.
sherrod
under
our
argument,
yes,
sir.
because
our
position
would
be,
your
honor,
that
there
is
no
reasonable
likelihood
of
vindictiveness
in
this
particular
situation,
again,
when
the
defendant
has
the
option
of
electing
which
sentencing
authority
shall
assess
the
punishment,
and
also
the
very
fact
that
in
this
case
a
jury
assessed
punishment
for
the
first
time.
the
judge
for
the
first
time
exercised
its
discretion
in
sentencing
the
defendant
at
the
second
trial.
mr.
randall
l.
sherrod
yes,
sir,
and
i
think
you
can
see
from
the
outcome,
that
was
our
position
because
we
did
not
ask
the
judge
and
the
judge
on
its
own
motion
did
not
file
the
findings
of
fact.
that
was
done
at
the
request
of
the
defendant.
it
was
our
position
at
the
outset
that
that
did
not
need
to
be
done
under
the
specific
instances
that
were
available
under
this
case.
mr.
randall
l.
sherrod
reading
your
interpretation,
yes,
sir.
reading
the
dissents
in
that
case,
i
think
there
is
a
question
about
whether
the
conduct
that
the
court
spoke
of
in
that
particular
case
was
the
conduct
of
a
defendant
in
pleading
guilty.
in
other
words,
i
think
some
members
of
this
court
feel
that
the
very
fact
that
the
defendant
pled
guilty
in
wasman
had
an
effect.
and
so,
i
still
think
there's
a
question
about
the
actual
interpretation
of
what
an
event
means.
mr.
randall
l.
sherrod
yes,
certain
dicta
of
pearce,
yes,
sir.
i
believe
that's
correct.
when
you
read
the
actual
opinion
that
came
down
in
pearce
and
when
you
analyze
the
interest...
and
really,
i
think
what
you've
got
is
this.
when
you
look
at
the
cases
that
have
come
down,
in
the
four
cases
i
previously
discussed,
i
think
what
you
find
is
that
the
court
now
is
really
saying,
the
mere
possibility
of
an
increase
in
sentence
or
the
mere
possibility
of
vindictiveness
is
not
in
and
of
itself
sufficient
reason
for
the
pearce
application.
in
other
words,
is
there
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
vindictiveness
will
occur,
and
that
is
what
the
pearce
doctrine
should
still
stand
for
today,
and
i
think
the
extension
in
the
application
by
the
texas
courts
has
limited
a
very
important
element
that
we
have,
and
by
a
strict
adoption
of
the
north
carolina
versus
pearce
presumption
of
vindictiveness,
what
they
do
is
disallow
this
very,
very
important
fairness
doctrine
to
both
the
state
with
a
legitimate
concern
in
exercising
discretion
in
punishment,
and
also
from
the
defendant,
to
have
his
particular
case
modified
to
the
individual
facts
of
that
case
and
also
to
the
particular
defendant,
his
background
and
everything
that's
brought
out
in
that
particular
case.
so,
i
believe
it
has
a
great
effect.
again,
when
you
look
at
the
analysis
on
it,
if
there's
any
chilling
effect
like
the
court
talked
about
in
united
states
versus
jackson,
the
chilling
affect
comes
from
the
application
of
north
carolina
versus
pearce.
any
defendant
in
the
state
of
texas
will
be
chilled
to
exercise
this
option,
to
have
a
jury
assess
his
punishment.
the
reason
is
because
he
cannot
risk
the
possibility
of
going
to
a
jury
and
receiving
a
greater
amount
of
punishment
under
the
doctrine
established
in
chaffen,
and
if
there's
any
chill
to
a
defendant's
rights
it's
the
chill
that
arises
from
the
application
of
north
carolina
versus
pearce
and
the
presumption
of
vindictiveness.
mr.
randall
l.
sherrod
it
is,
your
honor,
and
the
reason
my
argument
should
stand
is
because,
first
of
all,
to
modify
or
to
adopt
north
carolina
versus
pearce
has
a
chilling
effect.
you
cause
a
defendant
to
elect
to
go
to
a
judge
that
he
feels
may
be
vindictive.
you
cause
him,
because
of
chaffin,
to
file
to
go
to
a
judge.
it's
a
catch-22.
that's
what
it
amounts
to,
because
if
there
is
any...
if
there
is
any
chilling
effect...
you
do
away
with
the
chilling
effect,
the
state
of
texas
does,
by
statute.
it
says,
if
you
are
in
fear
that
this
judge
will
be
vindictive
in
assessing
the
second
punishment,
then
you
have
the
power
to
elect
to
go
to
a
jury.
but
he's
not
going
to
go
to
a
jury.
he
can't
run
that
risk
under
chaffin
versus
stynchcombe.
and,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
if
you
free
that
up
for
both
the
trial
court
and
also
for
the
jury
to
assess
whatever
they
feel
is
a
reasonable
punishment,
at
the
first
instance
when
they
have
an
opportunity
to
exercise
their
discretion,
that
that
is
more
fair
than
the
situation
we
have
through
the
actual
application
of
north
carolina
versus
pearce.
the
other
point
that
we
have
in
this
case
is
the
fact
that
the
judge
in
this
case
actually
was
the
court
that
granted
the
retrial.
now,
i
don't
feel
that
that's
as
important
as
the
first
two
areas.
i
feel
that
the
first
two
areas
are
the
ones
that
have
more
constitutional
significance.
one
thing
that
i
think
is
extremely
important,
depending
on
which
one
of
these
theories
the
court
may
decide,
may
have
a
much
greater
effect
on
the
nation
as
a
whole,
limited
strictly
to
the
fact
that
the
option
and
the
election
lying
with
the
defendant
should
control
and
should
say
that
because
of
that
fact,
north
carolina
versus
pearce,
the
arguments
will
be
restricted
purely
to
the
state
of
texas
and
states
that
allow
the
defendant
that
particular
right.
but,
if
the
court
goes
under
the
second
theory
that
we
have
proposed,
and
that
is
that
there
should
be
no
restriction
when
a
sentencing
authority
exercises
its
discretion
at
the
punishment
stage
for
the
very
first
time,
it
will
affect
also
the
federal
courts.
i
think
the
argument
is
valid
in
each
of
those
areas.
i
don't
believe
the
court
has
ever
written
upon
the
effect
that
retrial
would
have,
and
the
granting
of
retrial,
by
the
trial
judge
that
in
fact
sets
punishment
the
second
time,
and
i
don't
believe
the
court
has
ever
ruled
on
this
particular
authorization.
even
though
in
north
carolina
versus
pearce
the
same
judge
was
involved,
that
issue
was
never
raised
before
this
court,
and
i
think
it's
extremely
important
to
balance
the
legitimate
interest
that
the
state
and
the
defendant
have
in
wide
discretion
in
the
sentencing
authority,
and
that
must
be
balanced
with
the
reasonable
likelihood
of
vindictiveness
that
may
occur.
in
summation,
under
any
of
these
arguments,
i
don't
believe
it
is
necessary
for
the
presumption
of
vindictiveness
to
be
applied
like
the
courts
in
texas
have
done,
and
again,
those
courts
are
talking
about
following
north
carolina
versus
pearce
literally.
thank
you.
mr.
randall
l.
sherrod
yes,
sir.
mr.
randall
l.
sherrod
i
don't
believe
the
record
does.
i
tried
that
case
so
i
know
why
it
wasn't,
but--
mr.
randall
l.
sherrod
--no,
sir,
it
was
not.
mr.
randall
l.
sherrod
no
remorse,
yes,
sir,
and
i
don't
think
that
distinction
is
really
that
critical
because--
mr.
randall
l.
sherrod
--sir,
i
don't
think
that
fact
just
in
and
of
itself
should
be--
mr.
randall
l.
sherrod
--she
did
use
that,
now
i'm
saying
this,
i
think
under
the
circumstances
that
perhaps
would
be
a
valid
reason
for
the
court
to
assess
the
punishment
the
first
time
but
not
to
increase
it.
mr.
randall
l.
sherrod
i
don't
follow
that
question,
sir.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
randall
l.
sherrod
yes,
sir.
mr.
randall
l.
sherrod
yes,
sir.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
very
obvious.
should
we
limit
a
judge,
when
that
judge
can
in
fact
consider
that
evidence,
or
is
there
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
sentence
at
the
second
trial
was
caused
because
of
vindictiveness.
and,
that's
where
we're
urging
the
court
to
say
no,
that
there
is
no
necessity
for
the
presumption
that
occurs.
you
must
remember
that
the
defendant
may
always...
the
defendant
always
has
the
right
under
north
carolina
versus
pearce
to
come
forward
and
show
that
there
was
actual
vindictiveness
in
assessing
a
punishment.
so,
the
protection
is
there
for
actual
vindictiveness.
it's
whether
or
not
we
would
need
the
presumption
of
vindictiveness.
thank
you.
mr.
randall
l.
sherrod
yes,
your
honor.
very
briefly
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
address
the
problem
of
whether
or
not
this
issue
is
squarely
before
the
court
concerning
the
allegations
that
may
be
raised
in
wasman.
i
believe
if
you
will
notice
in
the
record
that
on
may
the
3rd,
1983,
the
state's
original
petition
for
discretionary
review
was
filed
in
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
which
is
the
court
of
last
resort
in
the
state
of
texas.
you
will
also
notice
that
that
petition
was
denied
and
discretionary
review
on
the
court's
own
motion,
on
a
very
limited
area,
was
granted.
it
would
be
our
position
that
the
denial
of
the
original
petition
for
discretionary
review
that
had
been
filed
by
the
court
and
did
in
fact
include
those
issues...
and
the
other
thing
that
it
is
important
to
remember
is,
wasman
did
not
come
down
until
after
we
had
filed
our
state's
original
petition
for
discretionary
review.
mr.
randall
l.
sherrod
well,
when
it
was
denied,
of
course,
the
court
on
its
own
motion
granted
discretionary
review
to
consider
whether
the
court
had
the--
mr.
randall
l.
sherrod
--yes,
performance.
that
was
the
only
issue
that
was
raised.
so,
i
feel
that
the
fact
that
they
denied
our
original
petition
for
discretionary
review,
in
fact,
was
a
ruling
that
would
allow
us
to
bring
that
issue
to
this
court.
mr.
randall
l.
sherrod
yes,
sir,
and
that
was
because
they
granted
discretionary
review
on
the
court's
own
motion
only
to
that
limited
effect.
the
court
will
also
notice
that
the
state
did
file
a
second
motion
for
re-hearing
and
that
we
raised
the
pearce
application
but
we
did
not
raise
the
subsequent
events
and
findings
of
fact
that
were
filed.
but,
it
would
be
our
position,
your
honor,
that
it
is
raised
for
review
and
in
this
court,
because
it
was
raised
in
the
state's
original
petition
for
discretionary
review
that
had
been
denied.
i
believe
that's
all.
