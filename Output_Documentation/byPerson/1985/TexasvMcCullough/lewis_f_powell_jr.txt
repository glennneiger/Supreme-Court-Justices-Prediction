justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
this
question
before
you
sit
down.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
does
the
record
show
why
the
new
evidence
was
not
discovered
and
used
at
the
first
trial?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
if
it's
not
in
the
record
i
suppose
you'd
better
not--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
blackburn.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
would
your
position
be
the
same
if
the
defendant
had
elected
again
to
be
tried
by...
again
to
be
sentenced
by
a
jury?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--to
prove
that
each
juror
had
no
knowledge
of
the
prior
sentence?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
if
the
results
of
the
first
trial
were
reported
in
the
press,
that
would
be
a
rather
difficult
burden
to
carry,
wouldn't
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
even
if
one
juror
said,
"yes,
i
read
the
story
in
the
press.
"
and
that
juror
were
permitted
to
sit,
you
would
say
they
had
vindictiveness
on
the
second
go-round?
