mr.
mark
i.
levy
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
question
presented
by
our
petition
is
whether
under
the
fourth
amendment
respondent
had
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
a
fishing
boat,
the
sea
otter,
and
thus
was
entitled
to
challenge
the
search
of
the
boat
as
the
basis
for
seeking
the
suppression
of
evidence.
the
district
court
held
that
respondent
had
no
such
standing
to
move
for
suppression.
on
respondent's
appeal
pursuant
to
a
conditional
guilty
plea
that
reserved
the
issue
of
his
standing
to
challenge
the
cert,
a
divided
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
held
that
respondent
did
have
an
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
sea
otter.
now,
the
facts
relevant
to
this
issue
are
set
forth
in
the
government's
submission
in
the
district
court.
although
respondent
is
the
proponent
of
the
motion,
had
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
issue
of
his
privacy
interest,
he
neither
made
a
factual
presentation
of
his
own
in
the
district
court
nor
contested
the
government's
factual
statement.
in
1978,
respondent
solicited
one
george
mayberry
hunt
to
participate
in
a
drug
smuggling
scheme.
pursuant
to
that
plan,
respondent
was
to
purchase
a
boat
that
hunt
and
his
crew
would
use
to
transport
marijuana
from
colombia,
south
america,
to
respondent's
ranch
on
the
coast
of
northern
california.
after
delivering
the
marijuana,
hunt
and
the
crew
were
to
take
the
boat
and
go
to
mexico.
pursuant
to
that
plan,
respondent
thereafter
purchased
the
sea
otter.
in
the
spring
of
1979,
respondent
turned
over
the
sea
otter
to
a
crew
that
had
been
recruited
by
hunt.
the
crew
sailed
to
mexico
to
meet
hunt,
and
then
on
to
columbia
to
pick
up
the
cargo
of
marijuana.
the
sea
otter
then
returned
to
california
and
delivered
the
marijuana
to
respondent's
ranch
in
june
of
1979.
following
delivery
of
the
marijuana,
hunt
and
the
crew
started
to
sail
the
sea
otter
southward,
but
were
delayed
by
bad
weather.
at
that
point,
california
fish
and
game
officials
boarded
the
sea
otter
because
of
suspected
illegal
fishing
activities.
the
state
officials
saw
things
that
led
them
to
believe
the
sea
otter
had
been
engaged
in
marijuana
smuggling,
and
they
so
notified
the
federal
authorities.
coast
guard
and
customs
officers
then
went
aboard
the
sea
otter
and
found
a
number
of
suspicious
circumstances,
including
admitted
violations
of
customs
and
immigration
requirements,
a
lack
of
documentation
for
the
vessel,
and
evidence
that
two
large
rafts
had
recently
been
used,
even
though
hunt
and
the
crew
denied
that
they
had
been
ashore.
the
sea
otter
was
placed
under
seizure,
and
escorted
to
a
nearby
coast
guard
station
where
its
cargo
holds
were
pumped
out
and
marijuana
residue
was
found.
no
formal
charges
were
brought
against
hunt
and
the
crew.
hunt
remained
in
the
san
francisco
area
for
approximately
nine
months
while
the
sea
otter
underwent
repairs.
he
then
took
the
boat
to
costa
rica
and
used
it
for
commercial
fishing.
hunt
turned
over
the
sea
otter
to
respondent
in
costa
rica
in
november,
1981.
now,
our
submission
here
is
straightforward.
respondent
did
not
have
an
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
sea
otter,
and
therefore
the
search
of
the
boat
did
not
implicate
any
fourth
amendment
right
of
his.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
we
think
he
cannot.
we
have
addressed
that
issue
in
the
reply
brief,
and
in
our
reply
brief
we
have
traced
the
course
of
this
litigation
in
considerable
detail,
and
that
discussion
demonstrates
that
the
entire
focus
of
this
case
is
on
respondent's
standing
to
challenge
the
search
of
the
sea
otter,
not
the
seizure.
the
seizure
issue
is
not
raised
in
the
district
court.
it
was
not
preserved
in
the
conditional
guilty
plea,
and
it
was
not
submitted
to
or
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
absolutely
clear.
we
have
quoted
it
in
our
reply
brief,
and
it
is
set
out
in
the
joint
appendix,
and
the
traditional
guilty
plea
is
at
page
21
of
the
joint
appendix,
and
it
says
there,
enters
a
conditional
guilty
plea,
an
order
to
preserve
his
right
to
appeal
the
district
court's
decision
that
he
had
no
standing
to
contest
the
search
of
the
sea
otter.
the
defendant's
appeal
will
be
limited
to
that
one
issue.
as
i
say,
we
discussed
all
this
in
considerable
detail
in
our
reply
brief,
and
we
think
that
the
entire
course
of
the
proceedings--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--that
may
be
an
argument
that
would
have
been
open
to
him
in
the
district
court,
but
it
is
certainly
a
different
argument.
a
challenge
to
the
seizure
is
certainly
a
different
argument
from
a
challenge
to
the
search.
the
seizure
argument
was
not
raised
or
preserved
below,
either
in
the
district
court
or
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
we
don't
think
it
is
properly
presented
here
as
an
alternative
ground.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
we
have
also
argued
the
merits
of
the
seizure
issue
in
our
reply
brief.
i
wanted
to
come
to
that
at
the
end.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
let
me
return
to
the
search
issue,
since
that
is
the
issue
that
the
court
of
appeals
decided
and
the
question
presented
in
our
certiorari
petition,
and
one
that
we
think
warrants
the
consideration
of
this
court.
now,
let
me
begin
with
the
recognition
that
this
area
of
the
law
does
not
generally
lend
itself
to
hard
and
fast
legal
rules.
inherently,
the
concept
of
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
will
frequently
depend
on
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
particular
case.
close
questions
involving
shades
of
gray
rather
than
black
and
white
differences
will
frequently
be
presented,
and
bright
lines
and
categorical
distinctions
will
sometimes
be
difficult
to
draw,
but
there
are
principles
that
guide
that
resolution
of
the
privacy
issue,
and
it
is
important
for
this
court
to
make
clear
the
legal
significance
and
proper
application
of
those
principles.
the
decision
below
establishes
a
fourth
amendment
standard
that
rests
on
a
fundamental
misunderstanding
of
those
guiding
principles.
now,
in
this
case,
respondent
from
the
very
outset
had
no
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
sea
otter.
our
position
is
not
so
much
as
respondent
characterizes
in
his
brief
that
he
abandoned
the
privacy
interest.
rather,
it
is
that
respondent
had
no
privacy
interest
at
all.
first,
respondent
never
personally
used
the
sea
otter.
for
example,
he
never
maintained
living
quarters
on
the
boat,
but
kept
his
personal
effects
there.
on
the
contrary,
he
specifically
purchased
the
boat
for
the
purpose
of
having
others
use
it.
in
addition,
respondent
had
turned
over
custody
and
control
of
the
sea
otter
to
hunt
for
a
period
of
some
two
months
at
the
time
the
search
occurred,
and
respondent
also
contemplated
that
hunt
would
retain
the
boat
for
an
extended,
indefinite
period
thereafter,
which
in
fact
proved
to
be
more
than
two
years.
nor
did
respondent
take
any
steps
to
preserve
the
privacy
interest
in
the
sea
otter
that
he
now
asserts.
in
these
circumstances
where
respondent
did
nothing
that
would
give
rise
to
an
expectation
of
privacy
and
relinquish
control
over
the
sea
otter
for
a
considerable
length
of
time,
he
had
no
fourth
amendment
privacy
interest
in
the
boat.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
before
the
luncheon
recess
i
was
discussing
that
respondent
had
no
fourth
amendment
privacy
interest
in
the
sea
otter.
now,
in
holding
that
respondent
did
have
a
privacy
interest,
the
court
of
appeals
majority
relied
on
four
factors.
however,
those
factors
do
not
give
rise
to
a
privacy
interest
on
respondent's
part.
the
court
of
appeals
first
relied
on
respondent's
ownership
of
the
sea
otter,
but
the
fourth
amendment
prohibition
against
unreasonable
searches
protects
personal
privacy,
not
property
rights,
and
this
court
has
made
clear
that
ownership
of
the
searched
area
or
object
does
not
as
such
create
the
requisite
fourth
amendment
privacy
interest.
bare
title
does
not
itself
create
an
expectation
of
privacy.
now,
this
is
not
to
suggest
that
the
court
has
abandoned
all
reference
to
property
interests
in
analyzing
privacy
or
that
the
fact
of
ownership
is
invariably
irrelevant.
ownership
will
often
be
associated
with
some
use
or
occupancy
or
control
of
the
property,
including
the
exclusion
of
others
that
raises
an
expectation
of
privacy,
but
it
is
the
expectation
of
privacy
deriving
from
the
use
or
control
of
the
property
and
not
the
abstract
fact
of
ownership
as
such
that
is
the
governing
fourth
amendment
consideration.
where,
as
here,
the
property
was
never
used
by
the
owner,
who
bought
it
for
the
purpose
of
having
other
people
use
it,
and
had
been
turned
over
to
the
custody
and
control
of
others,
the
owner's
paper
title
does
not
establish
a
privacy
interest
on
his
part.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
no,
i
don't
believe
so.
that
would
not
have
given
him
any
privacy
interest
in
the
boat,
given
him
any
personal
connection
with
it
that
would
have--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--again,
where
he
had
no
previous
connection,
no
prior
privacy
interest,
that
kind
of
reservation
would
not
by
itself
create
one.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
that
would
start
to
present
a
closer
question,
because
there
the
owner
had
made
use
of
the
boat
in
a
way
that--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--that
may
give
him
in
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
desk.
it
would
not
give
him
an
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
boat
as
a
whole.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
think
not.
i
think
the
nature
of
the
property
that
is
put
into
place
is
relevant
to
the
kind
of
expectation
of
privacy
that
one
might
have
in
it.
i
think
that's
correct.
but
let
me
say
in
this
case
all
that
is
far
removed
from
the
facts
here,
where
the
respondent
did
nothing.
let
me
also
add
that
even
if
the
owner
had
made
some
use
of
the
property
prior
to
turning
it
over
to
someone
else,
the
duration
of
the
relinquishment
here
would
be
such
that
we
think
he
would
have
lost
any
privacy
interest
he
might
previously
have
had
as
the
result
of
use,
but
our
primary
position
here
is
that
he
never
had
any
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
first
instance.
now,
the
second
factor
relied
on
by
the
court
of
appeals
was
respondent's
possessory
interest
in
the
marijuana
that
was
seized.
this
court's
decisions
in
salvucci
and
in
rawlings
unmistakably
hold
that
a
possessory
interest
in
the
items
seized
neither
establish
the
necessary
privacy
interest
in
the
areas
searched
nor
serves
as
a
substitute
or
a
surrogate
for
that
privacy
interest.
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
confuses
the
analytically
distinct
concepts
of
an
interference
with
a
possessory
interest
in
the
seized
items,
which
is
the
defining
characteristic
of
a
seizure,
and
the
intrusion
upon
a
privacy
interest
in
the
searched
area
which
is
the
hallmark
of
a
search.
now,
once
again,
this
is
not
to
say
that
the
fact
that
a
person
keeps
his
possessions
in
a
place
may
not
be
relevant
to
whether
he
has
an
expectation
of
privacy.
the
use
one
makes
of
a
place,
including
its
use
as
a
repository
for
personal
effects,
is
one
indication
of
a
privacy
interest,
and
thus
a
possessory
interest
in
the
items
found
can
be
evidential
of
a
person's
expectation
of
privacy
because
of
the
use
he
made
of
the
searched
area.
but
in
this
case
it
is
clear
the
respondent
never
used
the
sea
otter
in
a
way
that
would
in
fact
give
rise
to
an
expectation
of
privacy,
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
conclude
otherwise.
rather,
it
relied
on
the
simple
fact
that
respondent
had
a
possessory
interest
in
the
seized
marijuana,
and
it
is
that
approach
that
was
legally
erroneous.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that's
correct.
it
was
jeffers.
but
jeffers
went
well
beyond
that,
as
the
court
has
already
recognized
in
salvucci
and
in
rakas.
in
jeffers,
the
hotel
room
was
rented
by
the
defendant's
aunts.
he
had
permission
to
use
the
room.
he
had
a
key
to
the
room.
he
in
fact
entered
it
at
various
times
for
a
variety
of
purposes,
including
the
stores,
the
hiding
of
his
drugs.
the
court
held
that
in
that
circumstance
the
defendant's
access
to
use
of
the
room
gave
him
a
sufficient
expectation
of
privacy
that
he
could
move
for
the
suppression
of
received
evidence.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
not
just
because
of
items
other
than
drugs,
but
because
of
his
access
to
and
use
of
the
room
in
ways
that
essentially
made
him
a
person
who
had
a
sufficient
connection
or
had
an
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
room
even
though
he
did
not
have
a
common
law
property
right
interest.
as
i
said,
it
was
rented
by
his
aunts,
but
he
did
have
a
key,
he
had
their
permission
to
use
it,
and
in
fact
entered
it
at
will
for
a
variety
of
purposes.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that
interpretation
of
jeffers
as
the
court
has
construed
it
in
rakas
and
in
salvucci.
we
do
not
think
jeffers
even
at
the
time
but
certainly
in
light
of
rakas
and
salvucci,
we
don't
think
jeffers
can
stand
for
the
proposition
that
possessory
interest
in
the
item
seized
itself
is
enough
to
entitle
defendant
to
challenge
the
search.
the
court
held
squarely
to
the
contrary
in
salvucci
and
in
rawlings.
now,
i
should
also
say
that
salvucci
disposes
of
the
respondent's
argument
that
he
was
entitled
to
challenge
the
search
because
he
was
in
constructive
possession
of
the
sea
otter
and
its
cargo
of
marijuana.
salvucci,
in
overturning
the
automatic
standing
rule
of
jones
versus
united
states,
held
that
a
possessory
interest
sufficient
to
establish
criminal
liability
under
substantive
criminal
law
principles
is
not
equivalent
to
a
privacy
interest
protected
under
the
fourth
amendment.
the
doctrine
of
constructive
possession
is
probably
the
best
example
of
the
distinction
recognized
by
the
court's
analysis
in
salvucci
between
criminal
possession
and
fourth
amendment
privacy.
now,
as
a
third
factor,
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
to
respondent's
coventure
status
in
the
drug
smuggling
operation,
but
it
is
well
settled
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
a
defendant
cannot
vicariously
assert
the
fourth
amendments
rights
of
his
confederates,
and
respondent
concedes
that
proposition
in
his
brief.
nor
did
respondent
acquire
any
expectation
of
his
own
in
the
sea
otter
by
virtue
of
the
smuggling
activities
of
his
co-venturers.
nothing
in
hunt's
actions
in
this
case
created
a
privacy
interest
on
respondent's
part
that
did
not
otherwise
exist.
fourth
amendment
privacy
rights
are
personal
rights.
and
whatever
the
privacy
rights
those
aboard
the
sea
otter
may
have
had
cannot
be
claimed
by
or
attributed
to
respondent.
and
the
court
of
appeals
lastly
considered
the
presence
of
water
in
the
sea
otter's
hold
which
had
to
be
pumped
out
in
order
to
recover
the
marijuana
debris
to
be
a
sign
that
steps
had
been
taken
to
hide
the
marijuana
and
preserve
privacy.
this
reasoning
is
flawed
on
several
grounds.
first,
the
fact
that
a
criminal
strived
to
conceal
his
acts
from
the
authorities
in
the
hopes
that
he
will
not
get
caught
is
scarcely
the
same
thing
as
an
expectation
of
privacy,
let
alone
an
expectation
that
society
would
recognize
as
reasonable
and
legitimate.
moreover,
there
is
no
indication
in
this
case
that
respondent
had
anything
to
do
with
the
asserted
attempt
to
conceal
the
marijuana
or
that
it
was
intended
to
maintain
his
privacy
interest.
furthermore,
the
most
likely
explanation
for
the
presence
of
the
water
is
not
that
it
was
used
to
conceal
the
marijuana
that
was
being
transported,
but
rather
that
it
served
as
ballast
after
the
multi-ton
shipment
of
marijuana
had
been
unloaded.
and
as
the
government
stated
in
its
uncontested
submission
in
the
district
court,
marijuana
debris
was
observed
on
the
sea
otter
in
plain
view.
and
finally--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--well,
he
didn't
contest
it
in
the
district
court,
and
we
submit
that
it
is
too
late
at
this
juncture.
it
was
the
defendant's
obligation
to
carry
the
burden
of
proof
and
put
on
the
facts
that
he
submitted
were
relevant
to
the
disposition
of
the--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--i
don't
think
that
is
significant
to
the
outcome
of
the
case.
the
reason
we
put
it
in
our
brief
was
simply
to
explain--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--i
am
informed
by
the
u.s.
attorney's
office
that
the
grand
jury
transcript
in
this
case
contains
testimony
by
hunt
that
there
was
a
fire
aboard
the
sea
otter
and
it
destroyed
approximately
half
the
cargo
of
the
marijuana.
the
reason
it
is
put
in
the
brief
is
not
because
it
is
relevant
to
the
legal
issue
before
the
court,
but
rather
that
there
was
an
apparent
discrepancy
between
the
size
of
the
shipment
that
was
taken
on
in
colombia
and
the
quantity
that
was
attributed
to
respondent
in
the
indictment,
and
we
were
simply
trying
to
reconcile
and
make
it
clear
that
those
figures
could
be
explained
in
that
fashion.
now,
let
me
also
say,
and
perhaps
most
importantly
on
this
point,
that
there
was
no
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
cargo
hold
of
a
fishing
boat,
which
is
an
area
open
to
common
access
and
subject
to
routine
inspections
by
a
variety
of
federal
and
state
officials.
now,
in
reaching
its
holding,
the
court
of
appeals
purported
to
rely
on
the
conjunction
of
the
foregoing
four
factors,
but
in
this
case
none
of
those
factors
indicates
that
respondent
had
an
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
sea
otter.
whether
we
take
it
individually
or
cumulatively,
these
factors
do
not
suffice
to
give
rise
to
a
privacy
interest
for
respondent.
now,
let
me
turn
briefly
to
the
seizure
issue.
as
i
have
discussed
with
justice
o'connor
before,
respondent
now
places
primary
reliance
on
the
brief
in
this
court,
not
on
the
issue
of
his
expectation
of
privacy
and
the
standing
to
challenge
the
cert,
but
rather
on
the
argument
that
he
was
entitled
as
the
owner
to
challenge
the
government's
seizure
of
the
sea
otter
and
taking
it
to
the
coast
guard
station,
and
therefore
can
challenge
the
ensuing
search
as
the
fruit
of
that
seizure.
as
i
have
discussed,
we
don't
think
that
issue
is
properly
preserved
here.
it
was
not
raised
in
the
district
court.
it
was
not
preserved
in
the
conditional
plea
agreement.
it
was
not
argued
or
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals,
and
we
think
it
plain
that
the
issue
of
the
validity
of
the
search
and
the
issue
of
the
validity
of
the
seizure
are
separate
issues,
and
that
the
defendant
had
a
legal
obligation
to
raise
and
preserve
that
separate
point
below.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that
would
be
under
the
traditional
fruits
analysis,
but
it
would
not
be
because
there
was
anything
independently
wrong
with
the
search.
the
search
in
and
of
itself
could
have
been
perfectly
proper
under
the--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--for
this
purpose,
i
can
assume,
although
i
will
come
back
to
it
later,
but
i
can
assume
that
if
he
had
raised
this
in
this
district
court
and
included
it
in
the
conditional--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--but
it
is
not
a
question
that
only
a...
to
sustain
the
judgment.
to
be
an
alternative
ground
it
would
have
had
to
have
been
properly
raised
and
preserved
below.
rule
12
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
says
that
any
argument
not
raised
in
the
district
court
is
waived,
and
rule
11
on
the
conditional
guilty
pleas...
the
matter
that
is
being
reserved
by
the--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--that
is
right.
that
is
a
different
question.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
no,
we
submit
he
did
not
have
standing
to
challenge
the
search.
the
issue
of
his
standing
to
challenge
the
search
and
the
validity
of
the
search
are
different
from
the
question
of
his
standing
to
challenge
the
seizure.
now,
it
may
be
that
as
an
incident,
as
a
consequence--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--on
the
search
question?
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
am
not
sure
if
he
didn't
rely
on
his
ownership
in
the
district
court
that
he
would
be
free
to
raise
that
on
appeal.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
even
though
the
record
showed
it.
there
are
different
obligations.
one
is
to
adduce
the
facts
relevant
to
the
issue,
and
the
other
is
to
make
the
legal
arguments
that
one
relies
on.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
not
if
it
weren't
raised
and
preserved
below.
i
would
think
that
is
true
both
under
rule
12,
which
requires
that
arguments
be
raised
and
preserved
in
the
district
court,
i
think
it
is
true
under
the
conditional
guilty
plea--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--and
i
think
it
is
also
true
under
the
rules
of
this
court
on
alternative
grounds
for
affirmance.
just
yesterday
in
whitley
against
albers--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--my
understanding
of
the
rule
is
that
the
defendant
is
free
to
raise
an
alternative
ground
that
would
not
change
the
judgment
if
that
ground
was
properly
raised
and
preserved
below.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
think
there
is
a
separate
requirement
that
it
had
been
properly
raised
and
preserved
in
accordance
with
the
usual
legal
procedures,
and
the
court
said
as
much
yesterday
in
whitley
against
albers,
if
i
read
the
opinion
correctly.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
the
petitioner
can.
the
question
is
whether
respondent
can--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--that's
correct,
but
his
latitude
is
limited
by--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--that's
right,
but
the
limitation
on
the--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--on
the
respondent's
right
is
that
it
has
to
not
alter
the
judgment
and
that
he
had
properly
presented
it
and
preserved
it
below.
that
is
my
understanding
of
this
court's...
of
alternative
grounds.
now,
having
said
all
of
that,
let
me
also
say
that
we
think
respondent's
argument
is
without
merit
in
this
case
even
if
it
is
properly
before
the
court.
a
seizure
of
an
item
is
a
governmental
intrusion
with
a
person's
possessory
interest
in
the
item.
here,
the
government's
brief
detention
of
the
sea
otter
to
take
it
to
port
temporarily
restrained
the
immediate
use
of
the
boat,
but
that
action
did
not
interfere
with
any
interest
of
respondents.
at
the
time
of
the
seizure,
respondent
had
turned
over
custody
and
control
of
the
sea
otter
to
hunt
for
a
period
of
some
two
months,
and
hunt's
control
was
also
to
continue
for
an
extended
indefinite
period
thereafter
as
well.
respondent
is
the
owner,
had
no
cognizable
interest
in
the
immediate
freedom
of
movement
of
the
sea
otter,
nor
did
the
brief
detention
interfere
with
respondent's
residual
right
to
the
return
of
the
boat
at
some
indeterminate
time
in
the
extended
future,
nor
given
its
relative
brevity
did
the
detention
deprive
respondent
of
hits
ability
as
the
owner
to
determine
the
use
that
would
be
made
of
the
sea
otter.
that
would
be
true
even
if
the
detention
had
occurred
before
the
marijuana
was
delivered
to
respondent's
ranch.
the
few-hour
delay
that
was
occasioned
by
that
detention
in
comparison
to
the
two-month
duration
of
the
south
american
voyage
was
quite
inconsequential,
and
did
not
impair
the
purpose
to
which
respondent
had
put
the
sea
otter,
and
beyond
that,
since
the
seizure
in
fact
occurred
after
the
marijuana
delivery,
we
think
it
quite
plain
that
the
detention
did
not
deprive
respondent
of
any
interest
to
determine
the
use
of
the
sea
otter.
in
sum,
the
brief
temporary
detention
to
take
the
sea
otter
to
port
did
not
affect
any
interest
of
respondents
as
the
owner
of
the
boat.
if
marijuana
had
not
ultimately
been
found,
the
short
delay
that
resulted
from
that
detention
would
have
been
of
no
moment
to
respondent.
accordingly,
that--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--well,
we
could
based
on
the
subsequent
discovery
of
the
marijuana,
but
the
seizure
that
respondent
seeks
to
challenge
here
is
not
the
ultimate
seizure.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
because
of
new
evidence
that
was
found,
but
his
argument
would
be
the
same
if...
or
his
right
to
make
the
argument
would
be
the
same
if
we
had
temporarily
detained
the
sea
otter,
pumped
out
the
holds,
and
found
nothing.
his
interest
in
that
interim
detention
should
be
exactly
the
same--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--and
we
submit
that
he
as
the
absentee
owner
had
no
interest
that
was
infringed
by
that
interim
detention
when
the
boat
was
out
of
his
control
for
such
an
extended
period
of
time.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
have
a
few
brief
points,
mr.
chief
justice,
none
of
which
is
central
to
the
resolution
of
the
case,
but
may
help
clarify
the
court's
consideration.
first,
the
district
court
in
this
case
did
not
deny
an
evidentiary
hearing
to
respondent.
after
the
events
that
mr.
iredale
described,
mr.
iredale
then
asked
the
court,
will
the
court
allow
us
to
call
mr.
hunt
in
order
to
establish
standing
on
that
issue.
this
is
on
page
9a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
will
the
court
allow
us
to
call
mr.
hunt?
the
court
said,
sure.
then
mr.
iredale
said
that
hunt
was
in
costa
rica
and
would
be
brought
back
by
the
government
for
trial,
at
which
point
he
would
like
to
call
hunt
on
the
standing
issue.
the
court
said,
make
any
motion
you
like.
the
respondent
chose
to
enter
a
conditional
guilty
plea
at
that
point,
and
hunt
was
never
culled
as
a
witness
by
either
party,
but
the
district
court
did
not
cut
off
respondent's
opportunity
in
any
way
to
make
the
record
that
he
desired.
now,
in
his
argument
today,
as
in
his
brief,
respondent's
attorney
has
relied
on
a
number
of
facts
outside
the
record.
again,
we
don't
think
any
of
them
is
particularly
important
to
the
disposition
of
the
case,
but
it
does
illustrate
the
problem
that
arises
when
a
defendant
does
not
meet
his
burden
as
outlined
in
this
court's
decisions.
it
is
the
defendant's
burden
to
make
the
record
and
to
advance
the
proper
legal
arguments.
as
an
example,
mr.
iredale
today
referred
to
the
constructive
seizure
of
the
sea
otter
that
continued
after
the
hold
had
been
pumped
out
and
marijuana
was
found.
i
simply
don't
understand
that.
at
that
point
the
government
could
have
seized,
that
is,
forfeited
the
boat
because
it
had
been
used
in
marijuana
smuggling.
so
the
fact
that
the
government
retained
the
boat
at
that
point
simply
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
issue
here.
now,
contrary
to
mr.
iredale's
characterization,
our
argument
is
not
that
a
defendant
has
to
be
present
at
the
time
of
the
search.
aldermand
and
jeffers
and
countless
other
cases
make
that
clear
as
we
acknowledge
in
our
reply
brief.
our
argument
here
is
much
different.
it
is
that
respondent
never
in
any
way
for
any
reason
had
an
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
sea
otter.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
i
am
not
sure
it
is
as
clear
as
mr.
iredale
suggested.
it
is
not
clear
to
me
whether
mr.
quinn
might
have
consented
to
a
search
of
certain
parts
of
the
boat.
it
is
possible
he
might
have
as
the
owner,
that
he
had
he
proper
standing.
it
is
clear
to
me,
though,
for
example,
that
he
probably
could
not
have
consented
to
a
search
of
the
private
living
quarters--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--it
is
not
so
clear
on
these
facts.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
the
question
would
be
whether...
the
basis
for
the
consent--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--there
is
nothing
in
the
record
either
way.
the
basis
for
that
consent
is
not
the
abstract
property
right.
it
is
the
use
and
possession
of
the
boat.
our
quotation
from
matlock
in
our
brief
makes
that
clear.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
if
it
was
an
area
in
which
no
one
else--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--he
might
have
had
consent
to--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--well,
if,
for
example,
taking
it
into
the
port
would
constitute
a
perry
stop
or
a
seizure
of
the
people
on
board
the
boat
and
interfere
with
their
freedom
of
movement
and
their
right
to
use
the
boat,
it
is
not
so
clear
that
he
would
have
been
able
to
consent
to
that.
i
think
there
would
be
a
question
about
that.
but
in
the
end,
the
question...
i
agree
with
mr.
iredale
to
this
extent.
the
question
of
consent
and
the
question
of
expectation
of
privacy
are
very
similar,
and
matlock
makes
that
clear.
what
is
not
so
clear
is
what
quinn
as
the
owner
would
have
had
authority
to
consent
to.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
from
all
that
the
record
appears,
i
assume
that
he
could
have
done
that.
