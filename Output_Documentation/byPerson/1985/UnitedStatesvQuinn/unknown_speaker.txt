unknown

it
was
a
fishing
vessel,
and
it
was
a
substantial
size.
the
issue
before
the
court
is
very
narrow,
whether
mr.
quinn's
ownership
possessory
rights
of
the
vessel
gave
him
standing
to
contest
the
seizure
which
produced
the
ultimate
search
to
which
we
object,
or
whether
independently
mr.
quinn's
conjunction
of
interest
in
the
vessel
and
his
relationship
with
the
members
of
the
crew
give
him
a
privacy
interest,
but
we
should
not
and
need
not
get
to
the
ultimate
inquiry
if
it
can
be
satisfactorily
answered
by
an
analysis
of
the
seizure
issue.
why,
first
of
all,
because
a
temporal
analysis
requires
that
you
look
at
events
in
the
way
in
which
they
occur,
and
in
this
case
the
seizure
was
first,
the
seizure
was
prerequisite
to
and
antecedent
to
the
ultimate
search
of
which
we
complained.
in
united
states
versus
place,
the
court
held
that
although
no
privacy
interest
of
the
defendant
in
that
case
were
infringed,
the
fact
that
there
was
a
seizure,
an
illegal
seizure
by
virtue
of
its
prolonged
nature
vitiated
the
subsequent
opening
of
the
luggage
even
though
the
dog
sniff
violated
no
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
this
court's
cases
in
recant
years
have
made
explicit
and
clear
that
the
fourth
amendment
protects
the
people
against
not
only
unreasonable
searches,
but
also
unreasonable
seizures.
in
jacobson
and
maryland
versus
macon
the
court
made
clear
the
distinction
between
the
interests
protected
by
the
proscription
on
improper
searches
as
opposed
to
improper
seizures.
seizures
and
the
proscription
on
improper
seizures
protects
people's
interest
in
property,
their
possessory
interest
in
things,
and
therefore
it
follows
as
a
logical
matter,
as
indeed
footnote
6
of
the
salvucci
opinion
suggests,
and
i
think
place
on
pages
707
to
710
rather
clearly
holds
that
one
need
not
show
an
expectation
of
privacy
to
object
to
a
seizure,
and
also
as
place
tells
us.
if
the
search
which
is
complained
of
comes
about
as
a
fruit
of
the
improper
seizure
which
precedes
it,
the
rule
of
wong
sun
means
that
the
search
must
follow
independent
of
any
separate
judicial
inquiry
as
to
the
privacy
interest
involved
in
the
search
of
which
defendant
has
complained.
in
this
case
it
is
very
simple,
and
i
think
although
the
government
makes
pro
forma
protestations
to
the
contrary,
and
i
won't
make
their
concessions
for
them,
it
is
clear.
mr.
quinn's
possessory
and
proprietary
interest
in
the
vessel
here
give
him
standing
to
object
to
its
seizure,
which
was
of
a
prolonged
nature.
his
mere
absence
from
the
scene
does
not
constitute
a
constitutional
relinquishment
of
his
right,
because
the
owner
of
property
can
object
to
its
improper
procedure
whether
or
not
he
is
present
at
the
time
of
the
seizure.
in
order
to
object
to
the
seizure,
mr.
quinn
need
not
show
an
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
item
seized.
indeed,
the
fourth
amendment
prohibition
on
improper
seizures
protects
not
a
privacy
interest
but
a
possessory
one,
just
as,
for
instance,
in
my
briefcase
here.
i
have
two
interests
in
it
of
a
constitutional
nature.
it
is
mine.
i
own
it.
somebody
gave
it
to
me
as
a
gift.
i
have
a
right
to
the
privacy
of
what
is
inside
it,
assuming
that
i
don't
do
anything
improper
to
give
up
my
right,
so
the
contents
of
it
are
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment's
proscription
on
improper
searches.
and
thus,
if
someone
were
to
come
in,
a
government
official,
and
look
inside,
and
rummage
through
and
find
my
rather
messy
notes
inside,
i
could
say
i
object.
you
violated
my
right
to
be
free
from
improper
seizures
and
either
sue
the
person,
if
appropriate,
or
if
evidence
was
found
which
the
government
sought
to
use
against
me,
move
to
suppress
it,
and
in
order
to
do
that,
i
need
only
show
that
my
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy,
to
use
the
language
of
rakas,
rawlings,
and
salvucci,
was
infringed
by
the
governmental
action
or
interfered
with.
but
suppose
the
government
on
the
other
hand
does
not
open
the
briefcase,
but
a
district
of
columbia
policeman
on
no
basis
whatsoever,
let
us
assume
for
purposes
of
discussion,
comes
in
here
and
seizes
the
briefcase,
takes
it
out,
puts
it
in
a
locker
in
the
district
of
columbia
police
headquarters,
and
keeps
it
there
for
three
days,
at
the
conclusion
of
which
they
bring
rex,
the
d.c.
sniffer
dog,
up
to
my
briefcase,
and
he
takes
a
sniff,
and
terrible
for
me,
rex's
tail
points
toward
the
sky.
i
am
in
serious
trouble.
and
based
on
rex's
tail
going
up,
and
his
sniffing
and
whining
and
the
other
information
that
he
gives
us
as
a
trained,
keen-eyed
investigator,
the
district
of
columbia
police,
having
that
probable
cause,
opens
it
up,
and
instead
of
finding
mere
old
xeroxes
of
1800
cases,
they
find
a
quantity
of
a
controlled
substance,
or
a
1040
form
which
has
been
tampered
with
and
suggests
improper
manipulation
of
the
internal
revenue
code
by
yours
truly.
i
have
not
had
my
privacy
expectations
improperly
violated
because
they
had
probable
cause
to
open
it
up,
but
do
i
have
a
motion
to
suppress?
do
i
have
a
right
to
say
i
object,
i
move
to
suppress,
or
even
a
civil
suit,
assuming
maliciousness
of
bad
faith
on
the
part
of
the
police
officer?
absolutely.
place
tells
us
so.
jacobson
tells
us
so.
is
there
any
briefcase
or
dog
in
this
case?
