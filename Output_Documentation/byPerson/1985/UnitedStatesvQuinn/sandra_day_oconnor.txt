justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
levy,
the
respondent,
of
course,
has
changed
the
whole
attack
now
that
he
is
in
this
court,
and
says,
well,
the
real
problem
is
the
seizure
of
the
boat
and
possibly
the
seizure
of
the
marijuana
revenue.
it
is
no
longer
a
challenge
to
the
search
as
such,
and
i
wonder
whether
the
respondent...
whether
you
think
the
respondent
can
properly
raise
those
issues
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it
quite
clear
that
it
is
precluded
under
the
terms
of
the
reserved
issue
under
the
plea?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
his
argument
is
that
there
is
no
right
to
search,
because
the
search
was
the
product
of
the
illegal
seizure,
so
that
is
the
concern.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
do
you
distinguish
it
from
jeffers?
was
that
the
case
where
someone
had
a
possessory
interest
in
drugs
in
a
hotel
room--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--because
of
items
other
than
the
drugs,
you
think?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--it
referred
only
to
search,
didn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
have
you
ever
made
this
argument
about
the
seizure
of
the
boat
has
given
you
standing
to
challenge
the
search
of
the
boat
in
the
courts
below
this
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
you
ever
make
the
argument?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
thank
you.
now,
going
hack
to
the
appendix,
you
were
about
to
tell
us
what
page
that
material
could
be
found.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
iredale,
who
had
the
burden
of
proof
below
on
the
expectation
of
privacy?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right,
and
the
factual
record
is
a
bit
murky
on
any
elements
of
an
intent
to
exercise
control
over
the
boat
by
your
client,
end
there
are
a
lot
of
things
missing.
i
was
just
curious
why
we
have
such
a
sketchy
record
that
you
are
now
trying
to--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
didn't
put
in
the
record
the
specific
things
that
the
absent
witness
would
have
said.
