mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
question
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals
by
the
appellant,
mr.
quinn,
in
this
case
was
whether
defendant
michael
robert
quinn
had
standing
to
contest
the
seizure
and
search
of
the
vessel
sea
otter
in
1979,
when
he
was
the
owner
of
the
vessel
which
was
seized
and
searched,
and
the
owner
of
the
items
seized.
the
government,
which
here
says
that
the
seizure
has
no
part
of
this
case,
presented
this
issue
for
the
court
of
appeals
resolution
before
the
ninth
circuit,
and
this
is
from
their
brief
on
the
first
page,
"question,
whether
the
district
court's
ruling
that
defendant
quinn
did
not
have
standing
to
contest
the
seizure
and
search
of
the
fishing
vessel
sea
otter
when
he
relinquished
control
of
the
vessel
and
its
contents
to
ethers
was
clearly
erroneous.
"
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
with
respect
to
that,
justice
rehnquist,
i
have
to
say
that
we
use
imprecise
language.
what
we
meant
to
preserve,
and
i
think--
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
--what
both
parties
intended
to
preserve
was
the
fourth
amendment
issue
in
the
case
as
distinguished--
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
--i
cannot
recall
the
precise
language.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
it
is.
it
is
before
the
court.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
yes.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
yes,
it
did,
justice
o'connor,
and
that
was
because
there
was
one
motion
filed
under
the
fourth
amendment,
and
i
filed
about
15
other
motions,
and
we
intended
to
limit
it
to
that
one
issue.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
we
raised
the
seizure
issue,
but--
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
--the
search
being
the
fruit
of
it,
in
that
precise
form,
no.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
the
language
can
be
found
on
pages
21
through
24.
with
respect,
however,
to
whether
this
issue
is
properly
before
the
court,
it
is
framed
in
terms
of
the
facts
of
the
case.
i
think
that
the
substance
of
the
seizure
issue
was
fairly
raised
before
the
court
of
appeals,
and
the
government
recognized
that
and
addressed
the
seizure
in
their
briefs,
and
in
our
reply
brief,
for
example,
we
also
indicated
that
mr.
quinn,
for
instance,
in
the
reply
brief
mr.
quinn
clearly
had
standing
to
contest
the
seizure
of
the
sea
otter
because
he
was
the
owner
of
the
vessel.
that
is
on
page
1
of
the
reply
brief.
and
finally,
under
the
court's
rules
and
under
numerous
decisions,
including
helvering
versus
galrin,
302
us
238
245,
california
bankers
association
versus
schultz,
and
the
case
of
u.s.
versus
demas
compasarano,
the
prevailing
party
in
the
court
below
can
raise
any
grounds
which
fairly
supports
the
judgment
of
the
court
below.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
i
believe
whether
or
not
they
were
presented
to
the
court
below,
if
they
were
involved
in
the
facts
of
the
case,
and
i
believe
that
this
was
clearly
and
fairly
presented
to
the
court
below.
having
said
that,
let
me
now
turn
to
the
issue.
at
10:10
in
the
morning
on
the
28th
of
june
of
1979,
the
fishing
vessel
sea
otter
was
approached
by
a
coast
guard
cutter.
three
men
from
the
coast
guard
cutter
boarded
the
sea
otter,
seized
it
at
a
distance
that
may
have
been
on
the
high
seas,
but
the
record
is
not
precisely
clear,
took
it
under
seizure,
under
detention
some
15
miles
into
san
francisco
bay,
under
the
golden
gate
bridge,
and
still
detaining
the
vessels,
they
put
it
in
a
berth
at
the
coast
guard
facility
at
urba
buena
island
in
san
francisco
bay.
for
an
undetermined
period,
a
fair
inference
would
be
between
several
hours
and
up
to
a
day,
both
the
crew
and
the
vessel
were
detained.
at
some
point
during
that
seizure,
and
as
a
fruit
and
direct
result
of
the
seizure,
the
coast
guard
pumped
out
the
holds
of
the
vessel.
pumping
out
the
water,
and
apparently
by
some
mechanism
straining
the
contents
of
the
marijuana,
at
the
conclusion
of
which
they
had
a
little
less
than
a
handful
of
alleged
marijuana
residue,
actually
less
than
half
a
gram.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
none.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
except
to
say
that
this
case
in
many
ways
is
much
ado
about
nothing,
because
they
came
up
with
a
very
small
quantity
of
contraband,
the
only
relevance
of
which
in
the
case
before
the
district
court
would
have
been
to
corroborate
the
testimony
of
their
chief
witness,
george
mayberry
hunt.
in
any
event--
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
--how
many
tons
did
it
hold?
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
concerning
that,
and
i
don't
know,
justice
marshall.
i
don't
know.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
oh,
yes.
yes.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
yes,
sir.
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
a
good
many
tons.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
no.
i
was
using
it
as
illustrative.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
in
this
case
it
is
the
same.
mr.
quinn
owned--
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
--it
is
similar
in
certain
respects
as
a
container
of
things.
it
is
sometimes
in
the
possession
or
presence
of
the
owner
and
sometimes
out
of
the
presence
of
possession
of
the
owner.
it
shares
certain
characteristics
that
are
similar--
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
--please,
your
honor?
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
yes,
and
in
many
cases,
for
instance,
in
a
battleship,
i
would
submit,
if
i
owned
a
battleship
or
a
fishing
vessel,
it
may
be
that
in
certain
areas,
at
least
the
common
areas
of
the
deck,
that
is
open
to
public
view.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
well,
you
hurt
me
with
your
hypothetical.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
no.
with
respect,
let
me
get
into
that,
but
let
me
answer
you
first,
if
i
might,
justice
stevens.
if
i
had
given
to
my
law
partner
or
associate
the
briefcase
here,
i
had
some
very
important
cases
in
here,
don't
lose
it,
and
i
want
you,
if
you
would,
to
take
it
from
san
diego
to
washington
port.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
and
i
didn't
say
anything
to
it?
if
that
were
the
case,
then
i
have
relinquished
it.
if
i
say,
here,
this
is
your
briefcase
now,
or
you
can
use
my
briefcase
for
a
month,
and
during
that
time
it
is
yours
absolutely,
then
i
would
probably
not
have
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
on
the
other
hand,
if
i
gave
it
to
him
and
i
said,
i
am
going
to
give
it
to
you
for
two
months,
because
i
have
to
go
on
vacation,
and
i
want
you
two
months
from
now
to
bring
it
from
san
diego
to
washington,
d.c.,
don't
open
it
up,
and
please
don't
lose
anything
inside,
and
he--
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
--the
record
shows
that
there
was
a
plan,
and
that
everything
that
was
done
in
this
case
by
mr.
hunt
was
done
in
accordance
with
the
plan,
the
agreement,
the
joint
venture,
the
mutual
understanding,
and
while
i
shudder
to
confess
before
the
court
that
the
mutual
understanding
involved
was
an
illegal
one,
and
i
do
not
stand
up
before
the
court
in
support
of
a
necessarily...
person
who
is
innocent
as
the
driven
snow.
i
do
say
that
that
understanding,
like
the
understandings,
for
instance,
in
jeffers
or
bumpers,
was
an
understanding
between
people
which
has
its
source
outside
the
fourth
amendment,
but
which
gives
rise
to
protected
interests.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
on
the
expectation
of
privacy
issue
and
on
the
ownership
of
property
interest,
we
bore
the
burden
of
proof.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
there
are
three
reasons
for
that,
justice
o'connor.
number
one
is
that
we
elected
to
rely
on
the
government's
submission
as
we
have
a
right
to
do.
in
other
words,
we
are
entitled
to
rely
on
the
state
of
the
record,
and
if
we
feel
that
it
is
sufficient,
we
need
not
add
to
it.
the
burden
is
ours
in
the
first
instance,
but
if
the
court
has
before
it
facts
of
record,
we
can
rely
upon
it.
second,
with
respect
to
this
court's
decisions
in
rakas,
salvucci,
and
rawlings,
have
put
defense
counsel
in
a
terrible
box,
because
in
every
case
we
have
to
analyze
the
situation
and
determine
under
the
court's
holdings
whether
we
should
put
our
client
on
the
witness
stand
or
the
witnesses
on
the
witness
stand
and
evaluate
whether
we
have
enough
without
that
or
whether
that
is
necessary
and
what
strategic
advantage,
if
any,
you
give
up
to
the
government.
and
i
felt
that
in
this
case
i
did
not
want
to
put
my
client
on
the
stand
because
the
government's
submission
was
sufficient,
and
i
elected
to
rest
upon
it.
third
and
finally,
the
real
problem
here
is
that
standing,
although
in
rakas
the
court
noted
its
standing
and
the
substantive
issue
really
merged,
they
are
always
theoretically
and
temporally
separate.
standing
is
a
threshold
issue,
and
on
many
cases
the
record
that
comes
before
you
is
a
record
after
plenary
evidentiary
hearing,
so
that
you
have
a
transcript
which
gives
you
a
full
set
of
the
facts.
in
this
case,
the
district
court
judge
denied
us
an
evidentiary
hearing,
and
therefore
many
of
the
facts
that
would
have
been
adduced
had
we
been
allowed
to
go
forward
would
have
been
established
and
would
be
before
you,
and
there
are
facts
left
out
that
hurt
both
sides.
for
instance,
you
cannot
rely
upon
a
fact
which
is
not
in
the
record
that
this
vote
was
apparently
under
constructive
seizure
for
weeks
and
months
afterwards.
it
is
not
in
the
record.
and
on
the
seizure
issue,
for
instance,
that
would
held
us
greatly.
but
it
is
not
in
the
record.
so
i
am
not
going
to
urge
it
before
you.
but
that
is
the
reason
why.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
we
said
mr.
quinn
was
the
owner
of
the
vessel,
and
the
district
said,
sir,
well...
and
then
i
said
i
would
also
like,
if
i
might,
to
call
george
mayberry
hunt.
he
is
in
costa
rica.
he
is
subject
to
the
government's
power.
i
would
like
to
call
him
as
a
witness,
and
the
district
court
judge
in
effect
said,
what
is
your
offer
of
proof?
will
he
testify
to
me
that
mr.
quinn
was
on
board
the
vessel
at
the
time
of
the
seizure
commanding
the
vessel?
no,
your
honor,
he
will
not.
fine.
i
find
mr.
quinn
has
no
standing.
it
was
as
quick
and
as
brusque
as
that.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
he
would
have
testified--
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
--essentially
i
said
mr.
quinn
was
the
owner
of
the
vessel,
and
we
want
to
call
hunt
as
a
witness,
and
the
district
court
judge
said,
unless
he
will
say
quinn
was
on
the
vessel,
i
am
going
to
find
no
standing,
and
then
also
i
wanted
hunt
to
in
effect
amplify
the
government's
statement
that
was
submitted
in
the
special
agent's
affidavit
and
the
statement
of
fact
submitted
before
the
court.
mr.
eugene
g.
iredale
no.
you
have
the
record
before
you.
i
believe
that...
and
we
rely
on
the
government's
submission
and
the
fact
of
the
ownership,
which
was
stipulated
to
and
uncontested.
mr.
quinn
purchased
this
vessel.
it
was
within
his
exclusive
custody
and
control
for
a
matter
of
months.
he
turned
it
over
to
hunt
only
within
the
scope
of
the
joint
venture.
he
retook
the
vessel
at
a
later
time.
he
had
exclusive
custody
and
control
of
the
vessel
for
two
years.
he
was
arrested
living
on
the
vessel
in
san
diego
on
august
8,
1983.
with
respect
to
this
case,
the
government's
position
comes
down
essentially
to
this.
presence
at
the
scene
of
the
seizure,
at
the
time
of
the
seizure
is
the
sine
qua
non
for
standing.
in
rakas
the
court
says
mere
presence
on
the
scene
is
not
enough
absent
some
other
interest,
and
clearly
for
the
government
contend
that
would
require
everybody
in
order
to
protect
their
fourth
amendment
rights
to
run
from
place
to
place
or
thing
to
thing.
presence
at
the
scene
is
not
the
sine
qua
non.
it
is
in
some
cases
an
important
fact.
with
respect
to
the
constitutional
protection
which
mr.
quinn
invokes
which
gives
rise
to
his
rights
to
object
to
the
improper
seizure
of
his
vessel,
the
court
has
said
that
history,
although
not
determinative,
is
often
illustrative
in
giving
is
an
idea
of
the
fourth
amendment's
scope
and
of
its
protection.
the
history
of
our
country
and
indeed
of
the
whole
revolution
was
one
which
in
large
part
came
about
because
of
improper
seizures
of
vessels.
in
researching
the
brief,
i
was
gratified
to
find
that
one
of
the
incentive
for
the
revolutionary
war
was
the
seizure
of
john
hancock's
sloop
liberty
by
the
british
because...
it
didn't
have
marijuana,
it
had
madeira
wines
on
which
the
british
allege
that
mr.
hancock
had
not
paid
the
appropriate
tax.
the
history
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
steeped
in
the
right
of
maritime
ship
owners
to
object
to
the
seizure
of
their
vessels,
and
wong
sun
tells
us
that
mr.
quinn
as
a
ship
owner
who
has
not
relinquished
any
interest
has
a
right
to
object
to
the
seizure
and
to
any
fruits
of
that
seizure.
finally,
there
is
one
point
that
i
wish
to
make
that
is
suggested
by
the
government's
reply
brief.
in
this
case,
if
the
government
had
gone
to
mr.
quinn,
an
agent
of
some
kind,
a
dea
agent,
a
customs
agent,
and
said,
mr.
quinn,
we
want
permission
to
seize
your
vessel,
bring
it
to
urba
buena
island
and
pump
the
holds,
do
we
have
your
permission?
sure,
go
ahead.
if
at
that
time
instead
of
mr.
quinn
having
been
charged
in
the
district
court,
the
crew
members
had
been
charged,
i
think
neither
the
prosecutor
nor
the
district
court
judge
would
have
properly
permitted
an
objection
to
be
made
by
those
persons.
he
would
have
said,
after
hearing
the
facts
to
make
sure
there
was
a
full
and
voluntary
consent,
he
would
have
said,
no,
i
find
that
quinn
had
the
capacity
to
consent,
and
therefore
you
are
bound
by
his
consent
under
matlock,
bumper,
and
the
other
cases.
it
would
appear
to
be
only
logical
and
fair
that
if
a
person
has
the
capacity
and
power
to
consent
to
a
seizure
or
search,
they
should
have
a
correlative
right
to
object.
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
under
the
matlock
case
if
reason,
logic,
and
a
fourth
amendment
analysis
tells
us
that
a
person
has
the
capacity
and
ability
to
consent,
then
that
same
person
has
the
capacity
under
the
fourth
amendment
standing
to
raise
an
objection.
finally,
if
i
could
briefly
address
the
issue
of
mr.
quinn's
privacy
interest,
in
this
regard,
we
rely
on
the
jeffers
case
and
on
bumper.
in
rakas
the
court
cited
jeffers
and
bumper
with
approval
for
the
proposition
that
ownership
of
the
property
searched
coupled...
ownership
or
possessory
interest
in
the
property
searched
coupled
with
the
possessory
interest
in
the
property
seized
gives
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
to
allow
one
to
object
to
a
search.
in
salvucci,
the
court
in,
i
believe,
footnote
5,
cited
bumper
and
jeffers
for
the
same
proposition.
in
this
case,
mr.
quinn
was
the
owner
of
both
the
item
searched,
the
place
searched,
and
the
item
seized.
under
the
holding
of
jeffers
and
bumpers,
he
has
standing.
finally,
the
government
appears,
although
they
do
not
urge
it
here
today,
in
their
brief
to
raise
an
issue
that
one
can
never
have
an
interest
in
contraband
to
permit
the
assertion
of
a
fourth
amendment
interest.
while
it
is
undoubtedly
true
that
contraband
in
plain
view,
such
as
in
texas
versus
brown,
gives
right
to
no
fault
amendment
claim,
it
is
also
clear
that
in
rawlings,
for
instance,
the
court
held
that
rawlings'
ownership
of
the
contraband
was
plainly
a
factor
to
be
considered
on
the
expectation
of
privacy
issue,
and
in
trupiano
and
specifically
in
jeffers
the
government
made
an
identical
argument,
the
very
same
argument
that
they
made
here
today,
urging
that
because
title
21
at
that
time
provided
that
no
person
shall
have
an
interest
in
contraband,
that
meant
that
no
person
could
raise
a
fourth
amendment
objection
to
the
seizure
of
contraband.
the
court
in
jeffers
very
plainly
and
conclusively
held
that
that
was
erroneous,
and
that
was
in
1951.
in
sum,
mr.
quinn
as
the
owner
and
a
person
who
had
a
possessory
interest
which
was
not
relinquished
by
his
giving
or
entrusting
the
vessel
to
a
joint
venture,
has
standing,
has
a
right
to
object
to
the
seizure
of
the
vessel
because
it
infringed
his
possessory
right,
just
as
any
tuna
fleet
owner
in
a
similar
circumstance
could
raise
an
objection
to
the
seizure
and
pumping
of
the
hold
of
his
vessel,
so,
too,
does
mr.
quinn.
an
analysis
of
the
facts
and
this
court's
holding
in
bumper
and
jeffers
show
also
independently
of
the
seizure
issue
that
mr.
quinn
has
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
however,
proper
fourth
amendment
analysis
and
this
court's
holding
in
jacobson,
macon,
and
place
would
suggest
that
the
resolution
of
the
seizure
issue
alone
takes
care
of
the
subsequent
search.
