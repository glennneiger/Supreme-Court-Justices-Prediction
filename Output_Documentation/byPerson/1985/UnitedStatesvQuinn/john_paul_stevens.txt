justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
mr.
levy,
supposing
the
respondent
here
had
entered
some
kind
of
an
instruction
to
the
people
who
were
using
the
boat
and
said,
don't
let
anybody
on
the
boat
except
the
people
working
in
our...
whatever
we
are
up
to,
and
just
don't
let
people
generally
on
it.
would
that
give
them
any
kind
of--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what
if
he
gave
it
to
somebody
and
said,
i
don't
want
anybody
except
you
to
use
it.
you
can
have
it
for
two
years
as
long
as
nobody
else
gets
on
the
boat.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
he
said
i
have
got
some
papers
in
the
desk
i
don't
want
anybody
to
look
at,
so
please
don't
let
anybody
on
the
boat.
justice
john
paul
stevens
say
he
had...
please
put
these
papers
in
the
desk,
and
i
don't
want
people
to
look
at
them,
but
i
figure
that
is
a
safe
place
where
nobody
can
get
in
and
out
unless
you
let
people
wander
onto
the
boat.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
take
it
it
would
not
be
true
if
he
said,
please
put
this
gun
and
this
marijuana
or
this
contraband
in
the
desk.
then
that
would
not
have
done
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
stop
you
there
for
just
a
second.
isn't
it
true,
though,
that
if
he
did
have
standing
to
challenge
the
seizure,
he
could
as
an
incident
to
that
have
also,
argued
that
the
subsequent
search
was
improper?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
he
had
come
into
court
and
said,
my
standing
rests
on
the
seizure,
i
don't
care,
you
can
keep
the
boat,
it
is
a
lousy
boat,
i
don't
want
it
back,
but
having
standing
in
that
way,
i
still
want
the
evidence
suppressed,
and
therefore
i
still
have
standing
to...
that
gives
me
standing
to
challenge
the
cert.--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what
you
are
just
saying
is,
he
made
the
wrong
argument,
but
nevertheless,
if
he
is
right,
it
would
sustain
the
judgment,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
matter
that
is
being
reserved
is
whether
he
has
standing
to
challenge
the
search.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
the
evidence
shows
that
he
had
standing
to
challenge
the
seizure
and
as
an
incident
thereto
the
search
as
well,
doesn't
he
have
standing
to
challenge
the
search--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--supposing
he
had,
instead
of
arguing
on
the
basis
of
four
factors,
he
just
forgot
to
argue
that
he
was
the
owner
of
the
sea
otter,
but
the
records
show
that
he
in
fact
was.
could
he
in
this
court
say,
well,
i
fail
to
make
that
point,
but
that
would
sustain
the
judgment,
and
therefore
you
should
look
at
the
fact
that
i
own
the
boat.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
all
the
search.
i
am
just
saying
that
we
as
not...
it
is
still
a
search
even
though
it
followed
the
seizure.
that
is
what
he
says
he
has
got
standing
to
do,
and
one
argument
in
support
of
that
is
that
he
says
he
has
standing
to
challenge
the
seizure
because
he
owned
it,
and
that
gives
him
standing
to
be
before
the
magistrate
arguing
that
the
evidence
be
suppressed
as
well.
why
is
that
different
than
an
argument,
failing
to
argue
about
ownership
of
the
boat?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
the
record
showed
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
cannot
introduce
a
new
legal
argument
in
this
court
that
would
sustain
the
judgment
based
on
the
record
that
is
already
made.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
if
it
has
been
preserved
below,
it
doesn't
have
to
just
sustain
the
judgment.
you
can
argue...
the
petitioner
can
do
that
if
he
has
preserved--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
theory
of
this
rule
is
that
respondent
has
a
little
greater
latitude
than
petitioner
does.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
limitation
on
petitioner's
right
is,
he
has
to
have
made
the
objection
below
and
preserved
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
saying
the
same
limitation--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes,
but
isn't
it
true,
mr.
levy,
in
fact
marijuana
was
found,
and
couldn't
you
have
then
permanently
seized
the
vessel
as
a
result
of
that
ten-minute...
that
short
detention?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
as
a
consequence
of
that
seizure,
you
have
got
the
right
to
take
his
boat
away
from
him.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
had
been
an
unlawful
pumping
out,
i
suppose
he
then...
and
he
wanted
to
sue
you
for,
you
know...
of
course,
it
is
federal,
not
1983,
but
i
would
suppose
that
is
right,
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that
is
the
fact
here,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
record
show
that
your
client
said
that
about
the
boat?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
say
to
his
argument
that
quinn
could
have
consented
to
a
search?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
consented
to
precisely
the
steps
the
government
took
in
this
case,
taking
it
into
port
and
pumping
out
the
water.
could
he
have
consented
to
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not?
what
would
have
denied
him
the
authority
to
grant
such
consent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
anything
in
the
record
which
would
show
he
did
not
have
authority
to
grant
such
consent
if
he
owned
the
boat?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
his
legal
right
to
grant
that
consent
would
flow
simply
from
the
fact
that
he
owned
the
boat,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
know
what
we
are
talking
about.
taking
it
into
the
port
for
ten
days
or
whatever,
ten
minutes,
pumping
the
water
out,
that
is
all,
just
to
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
he
would
have
had
power
to
consent,
wouldn't
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
put
a
little
differently,
if
you
say
he
couldn't...
could
he
have
gotten
on
the
radio
wireless
or
something
and
talked
to
the
skipper
of
the
boat
and
said,
take
it
into
port
for
ten
days?
couldn't
he
have
done
that
as
the
owner
of
the
boat?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
would
think
so.
