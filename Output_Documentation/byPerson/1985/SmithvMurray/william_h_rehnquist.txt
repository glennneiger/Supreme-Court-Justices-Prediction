justice
rehnquist
mr.
snook,
in
your
argument,
are
you
going
to
sometimes
cover
the
waiver
point
that
you
didn't
ever
raise
this
in
the
state
court
system?
justice
rehnquist
are
you
suggesting
that
all
these
niceties
are
governed
by
the
united
states
constitution?
justice
rehnquist
we
are
talking
about
virginia.
justice
rehnquist
what
has
what
texas
has
said
got
to
do
with
this?
justice
rehnquist
but
even
though
the
substantive
standards
in
states
may
differ,
isn't
ordinarily
the
order
of
proof
and
who
can
testify
to
what
and
what
issues
you
can
testify
to
based
on
state
law?
and
the
aba
certainly
doesn't
purport
to
be
interpreting
the
constitution.
justice
rehnquist
what
error
is
this
you
are
referring
to?
justice
rehnquist
are
you
saying
that
is
a
constitutional
error?
justice
rehnquist
what
case
from
our
court
supports
that
proposition?
justice
rehnquist
you
are
not
really
claiming
that
there
is
an
inconsistency
in
virginia
law,
are
you,
that
the
fourth
circuit's
decision
is
inconsistent
with
virginia
law?
justice
rehnquist
supposing
this
were
coming
from
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
rather
than
the
fourth
circuit,
and
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
had
written
exactly
the
opinion
that
the
fourth
circuit
had
except
that
as
to
matters
of
virginia
law,
of
course,
it
would
have
spoken
with
finality.
you
would
still
claim
that
there
was
a
federal
constitutional
imperfection,
wouldn't
you?
justice
rehnquist
even
though
all
the
state
law
questions
were
resolved
against
you.
justice
rehnquist
we
didn't
grant
certiorari
on
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim.
justice
rehnquist
well,
that
is
the
murray
against...
whatever
that
case
you
mentioned
was.
justice
rehnquist
mr.
kulp,
let
me
interrupt
you
for
a
minute.
in
our
court
we
have
a
rule
that
amicus
cannot
enlarge
the
issues
before
the
court
that
are
presented
by
the
parties.
do
you
know
if
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
has
a
similar
rule?
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
it
requires
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
to
take
up
a
case
where
the
issue
is
presented
only
in
a
way
that
is
contrary
to
its
rules?
justice
rehnquist
do
you?
justice
rehnquist
you
think
this
court
feels
better
about
a
state
court
opinion
which
passes
on
a
lot
of
the
questions
that
weren't
raised
in
that
court
than
it
does
about
an
opinion
which
just
passes
on
questions
that
were
raised?
