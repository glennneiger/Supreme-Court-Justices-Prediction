mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case,
smith
versus
murray,
presents
three
issues
that
i
would
like
to
discuss
briefly
here.
the
first
is
the
issue
of
the
zant
versus
stephens
question
on
which
the
fourth
circuit
based
its
holding.
the
second
is
the
underlying
merits
issue
of
whether
the
prosecution
can
call
a
psychiatrist
who
has
been
appointed
to
assist
the
defense
to
prove
its
aggravating
circumstance.
and
third
is
whether
the
consideration
of
this
issue
is
barred
by
the
failure
to
appeal
this
issue
after
it
had
been
raised
at
trial.
now,
turning
very
briefly
to
the
first
question,
the
zant
versus
stephens
question,
this
court,
of
course,
in
zant
versus
stephens
specifically
reserved
the
question
presented
here,
and
we
contend
that
the
fourth
circuit
quoted
this
court's
decision
in
zant
versus
stephens
out
of
context.
every
statement
of
the
issue
as
it
was
presented
by
this
court
and
as
it
was
discussed
by
this
court
specifically
talked
about
the
fact
that
the
evidence
that
was
being
admitted
was
in
fact
admissible.
in
fact,
the
court
endorsed
the
restriction
that
a
different
result
might
be
reached
in
a
case
where
evidence
was
submitted
in
support
of
the
statutory
aggravating
circumstance
which
was
not
otherwise
admissible
and
therefore
the
circumstance
failed.
so,
zant
does
not
control
this
case
and
it
should
not.
i
would
note
that
zant
was
basically
an
eighth
amendment
case
where
the
real
question
that
this
court
was
confronting
was
whether
to
in
essence
federalize
every
state
law
violation.
if
there
was
a
violation
of
state
law,
evidence
inadmissible
for
some
reason,
for
state
law
reasons,
whether
that
became
converted
into
an
eighth
amendment
kind
of
issue.
the
court
basically
said
no.
we,
of
course,
have
a
different
situation
here,
where
our
claim
is
a
fifth
amendment
claim.
there
has
never
been
any
suggestion
by
this
court
or
any
other
court
that
we
are
aware
of
that
says
that
zant
versus
stephens
takes
chapman
versus
california
and
the
harmless
error
analysis
away
from
capital
cases.
there
is
not
a
case
out
there.
the
basic
problem
is,
this
is
a
fifth
amendment
case,
not
an
eighth
amendment
case.
now,
on
the
merits
of
the
issue,
i
think
in
order
to
understand
the
dilemma
that
counsel
in
a
capital
case
in
virginia
would
find
him
or
herself,
you
have
to
picture
yourself
as
that
defense
counsel.
you
have
just
been
appointed
in
a
capital
case.
virginia
law
allows
the
prosecution
to
prove
aggravation,
to
prove
future
dangerousness
with
prior
criminal
record,
with
psychiatric
evidence,
including
after
barefoot
versus
estelle
even
hypothetical
questions
based
on
instances
where
there
has
not
even
been
an
examination,
and
in
fact
can
prove
future
dangerousness
simply
from
the
circumstances
of
the
crime.
if
there
are
enough
stab
wounds,
the
court...
the
jury
may
infer
from
that
something
relating
to
future
dangerousness.
the
problem
is,
under
state
law,
therefore,
you
have
no
notice.
the
prosecution
is
not
required
to
give
you
notice
of
what
they
intend
to
introduce
in
aggravation.
you
as
defense
counsel
are
sitting
there
saying
in
order
to
prepare
my
case,
not
only
to
get
into
issues
of
mitigation,
but
even
to
mount
a
defense
as
to
aggravation,
i
need
to
find
out
whether
there
is
anything
that
a
psychiatrist
can
say.
you
are
not
a
psychiatrist.
you
don't
have
the
ability
to
give
that...
to
make
that
assessment
initially.
in
order
to
make
that
assessment
initially,
you
have
to
call
in
a
psychiatrist,
a
psychologist,
some
mental
health
professional
to
give
you
the
expertise
to
tell
you
whether
there
is
anything
to
go
on.
even
before
you
decide
to
in
fact
mount
some
sort
of
psychiatric
case
or
psychologically
based
defense,
in
order
to
make
that
initial
assessment,
you
have
to
have
an
expert
to
assist
you,
and
that,
of
course,
is
basically
what
ake
versus
oklahoma
said
in
a
slightly
different
context,
that
in
such
a
situation
where
mental
condition
is
fairly
an
issue,
that
it
is
a
requirement
of
the
due
process
clause
that
indigent
defendants
have
an
expert
appointed
to
assist
counsel.
the
problem
is,
of
course,
the
virginia
supreme
court
says
in
essence
that
is
fine,
but
only
if
the
prosecution
can
later
call
that
person,
that
member
of
the
defense
team
as
their
own
witness.
in
other
words,
virginia
says
that
you
can't
do
you
job
without
giving
away
your
client's
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
and
the
problem
that
counsel
in
this
case
would
be
confronted
with
and
counsel
in
every
capital
case
would
be
confronted
with
is
how
do
you
balance
or
should
you
even
be
forced
to
balance
those
two
rights,
the
right
to
put
on...
the
right
to
put
on
mitigating
evidence
or
at
least
the
right
to
counter
the
state's
proof
in
aggravation
on
the
one
hand,
and
on
the
other
hand
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
it
is
important
to
remember
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
very
first
witness
called
by
the
prosecution
at
the
sentencing
phase
was
dr.
pile,
and
dr.
pile
was
called
for
one
purpose
and
one
purpose
only,
and
that
is
to
say,
dr.
pile,
please
tell
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury
what
michael
smith
told
you
about
this
earlier
incident
on
the
schoolbus.
in
other
words,
everything
that
happened
thereafter,
all
the
psychiatric
evidence
that
came
in,
all
of
the
opinion
evidence,
all
the
cross
examination
was
directly
flowing
from
that
problem.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
that
is
right,
your
honor.
gibson
versus
zahradnick,
of
course,
is
the
case
that
we
were
working
under
as
we
were
coming
up
through
the
fourth
circuit,
and
it
is
a
case
that
says
very
explicitly
exactly
that,
and
in
fact
every
federal
court
that
has
looked
at
the
issue
has
said
that.
the
virginia
supreme
court
decision
on
1975
i
think
truly
was
an
aberration,
but
every
federal
court
has
said
you
cannot
call
a
psychiatrist
simply
to
say
in
the
course
of
the
psychiatric
examination
the
person
confessed
having
committed
the
crime.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
there
was
no...
there
was
never
any
document
filed.
there
was
no
intent
to
file.
there
is
no
requirement
that
anything
be
filed
in
a
case
like
this.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
well,
the
defense
had
asked
that
another
examiner,
dr.
pile,
be
appointed.
there
was
never
any
indication
that
dr.
pile
was
to
be
called,
i
think.
because
everyone
had
copies
of
the
letters
from
dr.
pile,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
the
prosecutor
would
sit
there
and
say,
i
don't
think
they
are
going
to
want
him,
but
he
was
not
subpoenaed
by
the
defense.
he
was
subpoenaed
by
the
prosecution.
so
he
was
called
by
the
prosecution.
there
is
no
question
the
prosecution
was
making
him
their
witness,
and
so--
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
--they
don't
apply
exactly
across
the
board
in
the
same
way.
there
are
a
few
exceptions.
one
of
them,
green
versus
georgia,
comes
to
mind,
where
some
mitigating
evidence
may
be
admissible
that
would
not
otherwise
be
admissible
under
a
state
court
rule.
but
as
far
as
the
general
rules
of
the
game,
of
how...
of
who
has
to
go
forward
with
what,
who
has
what
burden
of
persuasion,
what
burden
of
production,
those
same
basic
rules
do
apply,
and
in
fact
the
virginia
supreme
court
said
so
in
the
smith
case.
remember,
of
course,
that
the
smith
case
was
the
first
case
in
virginia
under
the
new
capital
sentencing
statutes,
and
so
to
a
certain
extent
a
lot
of
what
was
going
on
in
the
smith
case
was
the
first
run,
almost
experimentation,
if
you
will,
and
in
that
case
one
of
the
issues
that
came
up
was
whether
the
prosecution
had
the
right
to
present
rebuttal
at
the
argument
phase
of
the
sentencing
hearing.
and
the
court
said,
yes,
basically
any
time
the
prosecution
has
the
burden
of
proof,
then
they
have
the
right
to
close.
so
in
every
instance
under
virginia
law
certainly
it
may
vary
from
state
to
state,
but
under
virginia
law
the
courts
have
always
held...
have
always
decided
that
procedural
rules
that
govern
who
does
what
at
what
time
are
basically
the
same
as
they
would
be
at
guilt
phase.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
not
specifically
on
the
question...
i
guess
the
reason
it
would
matter
is
if
there
was
definitely
a
question
about
some
evidence
being
aggravating,
some
evidence
being
mitigating,
and
i
suppose
the
question
of
whether
the
door
had
been
opened,
the
virginia
supreme
court
has
never
gotten
into
questions
of
whether
the
door
was
open
to
a
particular
kind
of
testimony
or
any
of
the
other
kinds
of
considerations
that
would
sometimes
get
in
the
way
of
the
trial
court.
some
of
the
examples
that
come
to
mind
are
united
states
versus
nobles,
for
example,
where
there
is
a
question
about
the
door
having
been
opened
by
certain
things.
some
of
those
issues
have
not
really
been
decided.
in
every
case
that
has
been
presented,
it
has
always
been
assumed,
and
the
court
has
never
given
anybody
any
reason
to
think
it
is
not
a
valid
assumption,
that
the
same
basic
rules
apply.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
in
fact,
i
was
sort
of
wondering
whether
there
was
going
to
be
any
other
question
on
this,
and
then
i
was
going
to
move
on
to
that.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
an
objection
was
made
at
that
time.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
the
specific
ground,
the
ground
was
basically...
well,
let
me
see
if
i
can
find
the
exact
language.
the
objection
was
first,
"your
honor,
we
are
going
to
object
to
any
testimony
made
by
dr.--
"
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
--i
am
sorry,
appendix
page
4.
"with
respect
to
a
case
involving
or
an
incident
involving
the
defendant
at
some
time
prior
to
the
offense
for
which
he
is
charged.
"
it
goes
on
to
say
the
commonwealth
has
to
lay
the
foundation
as
to
what
the
doctor
instructed
mr.
smith
with
respect
to
his
rights
to
say
anything
to
him.
later
on,
the
court
decides
over
on
page
5,
the
court
analogizes
to
miranda
and
basically
goes
on
to
say
that
miranda
is
not
applicable
in
a
case
like
this,
so
that
is
clearly
an
instance
in
which
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
concerns
of
miranda
were
in
the
minds
of
everyone
as
the
issue
is
being
discussed.
now,
of
course,
the
problem
is
that
the
issue
was
not
raised
on
appeal.
the
question
is,
why
wasn't
it
raised
on
appeal?
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
if
he
had
elected
to
put
his
mental
state
in
issue,
there
are
a
whole
variety
of
possible
rules
that
one
might
come
up
with.
one
position
is
the
position
that
the
american
bar
association
has
taken,
which...
that
entire
position
is
cited
on
page
31
of
our
brief,
footnote
23,
in
which
the
admissibility
disclosures
or
opinions
in
criminal
proceedings,
it
says,
"no
statement
made
by
or
information
obtained
from
a
person
shall
be
admitted
unless
the
evidence
is
otherwise
admissible
and
is
otherwise
relevant
to
an
issue
raised
by
the
defendant
concerning
defendant's
mental
condition,
and
the
defendant
intends
to
introduce
the
testimony
of
a
mental
health
or
mental
retardation
professional
to
support
the
defense
claim
on
this
issue.
"
now,
a
mental
condition
may
be
put
into
issue
in
a
number
of
different
ways,
i
suppose.
one
of
the
ways
is
very
simply--
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
--i
think
if
they
had
chosen
to
put
mental
condition
in
issue
by
saying,
call
in
one
of
the
other
psychiatrists,
call
in
dr.
dimitris,
as
an
example,
to
say
what
he
ultimately
said
in
cross
examination,
which
night
arguably
be
mitigating,
at
that
point
the
prosecution
might
then
be
allowed
under
some
rules
to
call...
and
certainly
under
the
aba
rules
to
call
dr.
pile
in
to
rebut
exactly
the
point
raised,
in
other
words,
not
to
go
further
and
say
that
we
get
to
put
on
evidence
of
future
dangerousness,
but
specifically
addressed
to
the
question
of
the
mitigating
circumstances
as
to
which
dr.
dimitris
would
testify.
now,
admittedly
at
some
point
those
two
issues
begin
to
blur
together,
but
in
this
case
we
don't
have
to
confront
that
blurring
of
the
issues.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
no,
in
fact,
most
of
these
niceties
are
probably
to
be
determined
in
the
first
instance
by
state
law
by
the
state
statutes.
certainly
in
texas,
for
example,
where--
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
--i
understand.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
i
was
going
to
distinguish
between
the
texas
statute
and
the
virginia
statute,
where
virginia
makes
future
dangerousness
and
mitigating
circumstances
totally
separately
distinct
issues,
whereas
texas
does
not.
that
brings
it
all
under
the
rubric
of
one
question
that
the
jury
has
to
focus
itself
on.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
no,
and
in
fact,
as
i
say,
if
it
were
not
for
the
fact...
basically
every
single
possible
formulation
of
the
test,
if
it
involves
any
consideration
at
all
of
in
what
order
the
proof
is
to
come
in,
it
still
comes
down
to
the
fact,
because
in
this
instance
dr.
pile
was
the
first
witness.
everything
that
flows
from
what
dr.
pile
said,
all
the
psychiatric
evidence
must
be
assumed
to
be
flowing
from
that
in
terms
of
evaluating
exactly
where
the
error
was
committed
and
what
the
consequences
of
that
error
are.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
the
error
of
allowing
dr.
pile
to
testify
at
all.
for
example--
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
--it
is
a
constitutional
error
where
dr.
pile
is
allowed
to
testify
after
having
been
appointed
to
assist
the
defense,
to
give
assistance
to
the
defense,
then
be
called
in
to
testify,
basically
applying
the
same
gibson
versus
zahradnick
rationale.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
this
court
has
not
explicitly
stated
that.
i
acknowledge
that.
this
court
has
acknowledged
in
ake
versus
oklahoma
that
there
is
a
right
to
consult,
a
right
to,
where
mental
condition
is
an
issue,
to
have
someone
to
assist
the
defense,
a
right
to
explore
those
issues,
and
that
is
perhaps
the
basis
or
a
basis
of
that
right.
estelle
versus
smith
obviously
has
some
relevance
to
all
of
this.
one
of
the
concerns
that
we
have
with
the
estelle
case
that
we
mentioned
in
the
brief
is
that
inasmuch
as
it
seems
to
deal
specifically
with
the
question
of
waiving
those
rights
or
by
giving
notice
and
reading
the
miranda
type
statement
that
somehow
you
cure
the
error,
that
while
that
may
well
have
been
relevant
in
the
estelle
case
where
the
problem
truly
was
surprise,
it
is
not
going
to
be
helpful
in
the
average
case
where
the
problem
is
not
surprise
to
the
defendant,
but
rather
simply
the
question
of
whether
the
defense,
including
defense
counsel,
is
ever
able
to
explore
the
possible
mitigating
evidence.
now--
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
--not
really.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
we
acknowledge
that
under
virginia
law
the
evidence
is
sufficient
for
finding
vileness.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
yes.
now,
under
virginia
law,
of
course,
because
we
do
not
have
a
mechanical
kind
of
weighing
situation,
we
don't
know
what
would
happen
if
the
jury
did
not
find
future
dangerousness.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
and
that
was
based
on
their,
i
would
argue,
misreading
of
this
court's
ruling
in
zant
versus
stephens.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
well,
first
of
all,
i
would
note,
your
honor,
that
at
the
time
that
this
decision
was
handed
down,
there
had
been
no
statement
by
the
virginia
supreme
court.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
the
case
of
tuggle
versus
commonwealth--
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
--i
don't
believe
that
they
stated
that
as
a
matter
of
interpretation
of
virginia
law.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
that's
right,
and
in
so
doing
they
cited
zant
versus
stephens
and
they
cited
zant
versus
stephens
as
the
opinion
appears
on
page
165.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
that
is
right,
but
in
fact--
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
--no,
what
i
think
is
that
in
zant
versus
stephens,
this
court
was
faced
with
a
question
of
whether
evidence
that
was
inadmissible
as
a
matter
of...
an
aggravating
circumstance
that
was
invalid
as
a
matter
of
state
law
would
create
a
federal
constitutional
violation,
and
this
is
not
that
case.
now,
as
to
what
happens
when
the
court
in
reviewing
it
tries
to
weigh
what
is
left
after
a
federal
constitutional
violation
has
occurred,
that
is
the
question
that
this
court
specifically
reserved
and,
i
would
argue,
it
ought
to
decide
under
a
totally
different
rationale
than
was
decided
in
zant
versus
stephens.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
that
is
right.
that
is
right,
and
the
problem,
of
course,
is
that
under
virginia's
statute,
where
we
have
vileness
and
dangerousness
both,
and
there
is
no
specific
rule
as
to
how
the
jury
is
to
waive
these--
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
--well,
as
i
say,
i
don't
think
that
they
were
focusing
as
much
on
virginia
law
as
they
were
on
a
misreading
of
this
court's
decision
in
zant.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
no,
i
am
not
claiming
that.
all
i
was
pointing
out--
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
--that
is
right.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
well,
after
tuggle
versus
commonwealth,
i
assume
the
virginia
supreme
court
would
say
that
if
the
zant
versus
stephens
situation
exactly
on
those
terms
came
to
virginia,
that
the
virginia
supreme
court
would
hold
as
the
georgia
supreme
court
did.
in
that
instance,
i
am
not
asking
this
court
to
review
and
reverse
that
decision
about
a
purely
state
law
issue.
what
i
am
asking
this
court
to
do
is
to
recognize
that
zant
versus
stephens
and
the
situation
there
is
at
base
a
state
law
problem,
whereas
in
this
instance
we
have
a
federal
violation,
a
federal
constitutional
violation.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
yes.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
no,
not
that
it
should
taint
the
finding
of
the
other
aggravating
circumstance.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
but
that
it
should--
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
--because
there
was
the
violation
and
because
this
court
cannot
be
sure
under
virginia
statute
which
permits
the
jury
to
find
life
for
no
reason
at
all
except
simple
mercy,
there
is
no
way
to
know
what
factors
the
jury
was
considering.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
yes.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
yes.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
that
is
right,
because
the
basic
problem
is
the
fifth
amendment
problem,
not
the
state
law
problem.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
your
honor,
i
don't
understand
this
court's
decision
in
zant
versus
stephens
as
saying
that
every
finding
of
an
aggravating
circumstance
must
be
tainted
in
a
case
in
which
in
admissible
evidence
has
come
in.
and
that,
i
think,
is
the
fundamental
point.
where
inadmissible
evidence
has
come
in,
the
jury
is
considering
things
that
they
ought
not
to
hear
about.
in
zant
versus
stephens,
all
they
were
being
told
is,
they
had
a
different
rationale
for--
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
--that
is
right.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
what
we
end
up
with,
your
honor,
if
we
accept
the
position
that
it
has
to
taint
every
single
factor
is
that
if
you
have
a
case
in
which
there
is
no
question
about
vileness,
then
the
commonwealth
is
free
to
do
anything
it
wants
to,
commit
the
most
egregious
errors
possible,
and
know
that
if
they
get
the
death
penalty,
that
death
penalty
is
unchallenged.
that
is
an
untenable
rule.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
yes,
i
concede
that.
i
do
concede
that.
your
honor,
at
this
point,
unfortunately,
i
have
not
gotten
to
the
procedural
default
issue.
i
imagine
that
i
will
have
the
opportunity
in
what
time
remains
to
me
for
rebuttal.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
all
right.
i
will
then.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
that
is
the
point
that
we
have
argued
all
along,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
yes,
we
do.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
yes,
we
do.
in
fact,
we
had
raised
that
as
an
independent
grounds
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
but
that
was
not
an
issue
on
which
cert
was
granted.
however,
as
we
pointed
out,
a
number
of
cases
that
this
court
has
decided
have
indicated
that
we
are
not
going
to
decide
the
case
in
a
vacuum
without
considering
that
which
counsel
did
after
having
made
the
objection.
harris
versus
united
states
is
the
case
that
comes
to
mind
there.
in
terms
of
the
procedural
default
issue,
our
grounds
for
saying
that
this
court
ought
to
reach
the
merits
are
first
of
all
to
fall
back
on
the
fact
that
this
court
has
always
maintained
that
there
is
an
equitable
discretion...
federal
habeas
court
to
consider
these
issues.
in
terms
of
the
cause
and
prejudice
test,
the
most
obvious
ground
for
cause
is
the
ground
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
now,
i
understand
this
court
is
considering
in
the
case
of
sealoft
versus
carrier...
i
guess
it
is
murray
versus
carrier
by
now...
exactly
how
that
will
play
into
the
cause
requirement,
but
i
would
note
a
couple
of
things,
first
of
all,
that
had
counsel
read
gibson
versus
commonwealth
before
they
decided
to
weigh
the
issue
on
appeal,
they
would
have
seen
the
specific
incident,
the
specific
citation
in
there.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
but
it
was
a
case
in
which
they
did
not
do
what
they
should
have
done
to
research
the
question.
in
other
words,
there
was
not
a
decision
by
informed
counsel.
they
stated...
mr.
pugh
stated--
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
--it
was.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
well,
if
in
fact
he
is
bound
by
that,
and
if
in
fact
he
is
bound
not
to...
if
counsel
is
not
supposed
to
take
a
good,
close
look
at
gibson,
and
if
in
fact
he
is
not
supposed
to
understand
that
the
issue
is
still
in
dispute
and
to
understand
that
this
case
will
ultimately
reach
a
federal
court,
all
of
which,
i
submit,
counsel
is
bound
to
do,
particularly
in
a
capital
case,
maybe
not
in
a
shoplifting
case,
but
it
is
certain
that
a
capital
case
is
going
to
result
in
coming
to
the
federal
courts,
that
he
ought
to
be
looking
at
federal
law,
that
particularly
in...
gibson
versus
commonwealth
pointed
that
out,
where
there
were
cases
coming
down
right
and
left
in
other
jurisdictions
cited
in
criminal
law
reporter
and
other
places
where
the
amicus
brief
raised
the
issue,
and
there
wasn't
even
any
sort
of
attempt
to
supplement
the
record
or
supplement
the
assignments
of
error...
i
don't
know
whether
such
a
happening
could
occur
under
virginia
law,
but
even
if...
they
didn't
even
try,
and
if
they
had
tried,
maybe
the
situation
would
be
different.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
that
is
right.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
and
not
only
is
perceived
futility
but
it
is
specifically
futility
that
is
perceived
because
counsel
did
not
do
what
reasonable
counsel
would
have
done,
which
is
to
at
least
follow
up
on
the
statement
in
gibson
versus
commonwealth--
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
--but
if
in
fact
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
as
being
cause
can
be
considered
in
rebuttal--
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
--right,
but
even
if
we
don't
have
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
i
would
argue
that
the
policies
of
engle
versus
isaac,
the
policies
of
wainwright
versus
sykes
all
deal
with
this
equitable
discretion,
and
that
in
fact
the
question
is
whether
there
is
an
adequate
state
ground
adequately
serving
state
interests.
in
the
peculiar
facts
of
this
case,
where
there
is
a
case
immediately
decided
by
the
virginia
supreme
court
for
the
first
capital
case,
where
the
amicus
brief
had
raised
the
issue,
where
after
the
briefs
went
in
the
fourth
circuit
decided
the
question,
the
issue
was
raised
at
trial,
default
was
only
on
appeal,
under
all
of
these
circumstances
we
submit
that
the
equitable
discretion
of
the
federal
courts
ought
to
be
exercised
in
terms
of
hearing
the
case.
at
this
point
i
would
like
to
try
to
reserve
whatever
few
seconds
i
may
have.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
thank
you,
your
honor.
there
are
just
a
couple
of
points
i
would
like
to
make.
first
of
all,
as
far
us
the
question
of
whether
the
amicus
brief
even
in
fact
presented
this
issue,
the
answer
is,
it
did,
and
if
you
look
at
the
amicus
brief
that
is
in
the
record,
pages
56
through
61,
there
is
a
six-page
discussion
based
on
smith
versus
estelle
of
exactly
how
this
evidence
ought
to
be
treated
and
how
it
ought
to
be
ruled
inadmissible.
now,
as
far
as
the
procedural
default
issues
there
are
a
couple
of
points
that
i
think
need
to
be
reiterated.
one
is
that
this
is
in
fact
a
capital
case.
that
means
not
only
that
somebody
is
going
to
be
executed
about
all...
if
in
fact
this
issue
is
not...
doesn't
result
in
a
reversal,
but
more
importantly,
the
additional
obligations
that
are
imposed
by
this
court
on
the
virginia
supreme
court
in
reviewing
these
cases
have
to
be
considered
as
well.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
your
honor,
the
one
point
that
i--
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
--not...
first
of
all,
there
is
no...
well,
okay.
yes,
in
order
to
answer
that
question
very
specifically,
no,
i
do
not
think
that
necessarily.
i
do
say,
however,
that
where...
i
mean,
this
court
has
always
prized
thorough
appellate
review,
including
review
that
goes
into
issues
not
presented
to
it,
issues
raised
below.
mr.
j.
lloyd
snook,
iii
if
in
fact
you
accept
what
mr.
kulp
is
suggesting,
that
this
court
ought
to
give
great
deference
to
what
happens
below
because
of
that
mandatory
appellate
review,
yes,
i
would
think
you
would
feel
better
about
it
if
in
fact
they
reviewed
the
record
in
its
entirety.
now,
the
other
point
that
i
wanted
to
make
relating
to
that
is
simply
that
counsel's
failure
in
this
case
was
the
failure
to
research
the
law,
not
just
to
make
the
appeal,
but
failure
to
research
the
law,
and
that
was
the
inexcusable
neglect.
that
is
the
cause
for
the
failure
to
appeal.
as
far
as
the
zant
versus
stephens
questions,
first
of
all,
we
obviously
agree
with
justice
stevens
that
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
a
harmless
error
inquiry.
in
neither
zant
nor
barclay
was
there
an
independent
constitutional
violation.
those
cases
do
not
displace
the
harmless
error
analysis.
michael
smith
was
entitled
to
a
constitutionally
fair
sentencing
hearing
free
of
harmful
error,
free
of
harmful
constitutional
error.
finally,
the
constitutional
flaw
is
not
in
the
vileness
finding,
but
is
in
the
jury's
decision
to
impose
the
death
sentence.
it
is
not
enough
under
virginia
law
to
find
one
aggravating
circumstance.
you
have
to
go
beyond
that
to
find
that
the
jury
is
going
to
recommend
the
death
sentence
based
on
all
the
evidence
that
it
has
heard.
in
other
words,
we
are
back
to
the
question
of
harmless
error.
you
cannot
say
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
using
the
harmless
error
analysis
that
this
jury
heard
and
based
its
decision
on
only
admissible
evidence.
for
that
reason
we
ask
that
you
reverse
the
conviction
and
send
it
back
for
a
new
trial.
