yes,
but
can
you
use
that
as
a
justification
for
putting
inadmissible
evidence
in,
that
they
might
have
gotten
the
evidence
from
another
source?
justice
stevens
if
you
assume
for
the
moment
it
is
inadmissible,
which--
justice
stevens
--if
you
assume
it
is
inadmissible,
and
if
you
also
assume
it
would
tend
to
make
the
jury
more
likely
to
impose
the
death
sentence,
what
difference
does
it
make
that
there
is
another...
i
don't
understand
your
argument
relying
on
the
other
aggravating
circumstance.
justice
stevens
that
is
the
harmless
error
argument.
that
is
chapman
against
california.
justice
stevens
but
that
is
quite
different
from
the
rationale
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
stevens
and
you
have
just
agreed
that
would
not
be
a
sufficient
rationale
if
it
was
prejudicial
evidence
and
inadmissible.
justice
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that...
but
then
it
is
not
a
zant
argument.
then
it
is
a
harmless
error
argument,
it
seems
to
me.
that
is
what
i
am
trying
to--
justice
stevens
--there
is...
theoretically,
at
least,
there
is
quite
a
difference
between
the
two
approaches.
justice
stevens
no,
they
said
something
quite
different.
justice
stevens
they
said,
as
i
understand
them,
that
as
long
as
there
is
one
aggravating
circumstance
supported
by
the
evidence,
it
doesn't
matter
how
much
error
there
is
with
regard
to
the
other
aggravating
circumstance.
i
think
that
is
the
logical
extreme,
i
suppose.
i
am
overstating
it,
but
that
is
really
what
the
position
amounts
to.
justice
stevens
you
are
making
sort
of
a
different
argument.
you
are
saying
really
it
is
harmless
and
it
is
close
enough--
justice
stevens
--no,
of
course
not.
justice
stevens
but
the
harmless
error
argument
is
one
that
you
would
be
asking
us
to
make
the
harmless
error
determination.
we
can't
really
read
the
fourth
circuit.
or
are
you
saying
we
should
read
the--
