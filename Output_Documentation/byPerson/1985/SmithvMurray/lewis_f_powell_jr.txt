justice
jr.
may
i
just
ask
one
question
before
you
proceed?
is
it
a
fact...
look
at
page
6
of
the
appendix,
please,
sir...
that
the
prosecuting
attorney
asked
dr.
file
only
one
question
that
you
objected
to?
justice
jr.
and
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
do
you
think
the
cross-examination
did
your
client's
case
more
harm
than
that
one
question?
justice
jr.
you
agree
that
the--
justice
jr.
--that
counsel
for
the
defendant
should
not
have
cross
examined--
