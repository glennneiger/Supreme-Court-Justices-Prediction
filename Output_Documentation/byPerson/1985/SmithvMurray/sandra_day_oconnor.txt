justice
o'connor
well,
before
you
get
there,
mr.
snook,
what
if
your
client
had
elected
to
put
his
mental
state
in
issue?
justice
o'connor
if
your
client
had
put
it
at
issue
but
didn't
choose
to
call
dr.
pile,
could
the
state
have
done
so?
justice
o'connor
way
don't
you
address
it,
because
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
it
is
determinative?
justice
o'connor
--unlike
murray
versus
carrier,
i
suppose,
here
counsel
made
a
deliberate
decision
not
to
argue
this
on
appeal.
this
isn't
some
inadvertence
as
was
argued
in
that
case.
this
was
a
deliberate
decision
and
choice
by
counsel
not
to
raise
this.
he
raised
17
other
issues,
and
argued
then
with
vigor,
but
not
this
one
by
choice.
justice
o'connor
it
was
certainly
consistent
with
virginia
law
at
the
time.
justice
o'connor
the
fourth
circuit
had
not
issued
its
holding.
justice
o'connor
so
why
isn't
he
bound
by
it?
justice
o'connor
well,
engle
versus
isaac
says
that
perceived
futility
alone
doesn't
count
as
cause.
justice
o'connor
and
that
is
what
we
have,
and
we
have
a
deliberate
choice.
