mr.
james
e.
kulp
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
fifth
amendment
issue
is
not
properly
before
the
court
because
of
this
court's
ruling
in
the
case
of
wainwright
versus
sykes.
as
mr.
snook
has
indicated,
at
the
trial
of
the
case
the
defense
attorney
did
make
an
objection
to
the
testimony
of
dr.
pile.
i
think
the
reading
of
the
record
would
indicate
that
that
objection
was
based
solely
on
the
fifth
amendment
ground.
the
attorney
at
the
state
habeas
proceeding
was
asked
specifically
why
he
did
not
raise
the
issue
on
appeal.
he
testified
that
he
had
and
his
associates
had
examined
the
law
and
determined
that
in
their
judgment
this
issue
would
not
be
meritorious.
i
think
the
court
has
to
recognize
that
what
the
attorney
has
to
do
and
what
this
court
has
indicated
that
attorneys
are
supposed
to
do
is
exercise
professional
judgment.
in
jones
versus
barnes
the
court
clearly
indicated
that
on
appeal,
that
counsel
were
not
required
under
the
constitution
to
raise
all
non-frivolous
issues,
that
counsel
was
supposed
to
winnow
out
those
arguments
which
they
believed
would
be
meritorious
and
those
which
they
believed
would
not
be
meritorious.
in
this
case,
counsel
indicated
and
the
testimony
is
clear
that
after
the
trial
they
went
through
the
transcript
and
looked
at
every
objection
which
had
been
raised
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
and
they
considered
each
one
of
those.
than
after
making
the
decision
that
this
particular
issue
would
not
be
meritorious,
they
then
raised
17
issues
on
appeal.
we
submit
that
what
counsel
did
in
this
case
is
fully
consistent
with
what
the
court
has
indicated
that
counsel
is
supposed
to
do.
i
would
respond
to
mr.
snook
by
indicating
that
there
was
an
amicus
brief
filed
in
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
on
direct
appeal.
i
would
disagree
with
mr.
snook
as
to
what
issues
the
amicus
brief
raised.
the
amicus
brief
did
not
question
at
all
the
testimony
of
dr.
pile
as
it
related
to
the
bus
incident.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
they
do
in
this
respect,
justice
rehnquist.
in
this
specific
case
that
we
are
talking
about,
in
the
supreme
court
opinion,
in
footnote
number
1,
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
specifically
said
they
would
not
recognize
any
arguments
raised
by
an
amicus
which
had
not
been
raised
and
briefed
by
the
parties.
so,
i
think
that
that
is
the
same
rule
which
this
court
applies,
and
i
would
say
that
the
amicus
brief,
as
i
indicated,
did
not
focus
on,
did
not
raise
any
question
about
the
testimony
which
is
now
being
raised
in
this
court
as
such
an
egregious
admission
of
evidence.
what
they
were
concerned
about,
they
indicated
that,
one,
an
example
for
competency
and
sanity
was
not
sufficient
to
focus
on
future
dangerousness.
they
also
argued
that
only
forensic
psychiatrists
should
be
called
upon
to
determine
dangerousness,
and
further,
that
the
fifth
amendment
applies
when
the
defendant
is
ordered
to
undergo
an
examination
to
determine
dangerousness.
not
once
in
the
amicus
brief,
even,
did
they
raise
the
issue
that
this
evidence
was
harmful
in
any
respect.
on
the
reply
brief,
the
petitioner
has
tried
to
indicate
that
since
this
is
an
appellate
default,
that
the
rules
of
this
court
in
wainwright
versus
sykes
would
not
apply.
i
have
two
answers
to
that.
first
of
all,
when
the
petition
was
filed
in
the
district
court,
federal
district
court,
and
we
filed
our
response
and
for
the
first
time
raised
the
procedural
argument
under
wainwright
versus
sykes,
the
petitioner
did
not
at
that
time
raise
any
question
that
there
was
any
distinction
between
trial
omission
and
failure
to
raise
the
omission
on
appeal.
again,
when
we
went
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals,
the
petitioner
never
questioned
the
fact
that
wainwright
versus
sykes
applied
in
an
appellate
default.
i
would
also
say
i
think
that
this
court
has
recently
addressed
that
issue
in
reed
versus
ross,
which
itself
was
an
appellate
default
case,
and
the
court
went
on
to
indicate
that
the
reasons
that
wainwright
versus
sykes
applied
even
in
an
appellate
default
situation
is
because
it
affords
the
states
the
opportunity
to
resolve
the
issue
shortly
after
the
trial,
while
the
evidence
is
still
available
both
to
assess
the
defendant's
claims
and
to
retry
effectively
if
the
defendant
prevails,
and
secondly,
to
foster
finality
of
the
decision
by
forcing
the
defendant
to
litigate
all
claims
together
as
quickly
after
trial
as
the
docket
will
allow
while
the
appellate
court
has
its
attention
focused
on
the
case.
we
submit
that
in
this
case
the
district
court
clearly
found
there
was
a
waiver
under
wainwright
versus
sykes.
the
fourth
circuit
in
our
view
did
not
address
the
issue.
we
believe
they
should
have
affirmed
on
that
ground
alone,
and
we
wouldn't
have
the
issues
being
raised
in
this
court
such
as
the
questions
of
whether
the
fifth
amendment
applies
or
whether
it
does
not
apply
as
the
amicus
in
this
court
have
tried
to
bring
in
a
sixth
amendment
claim,
which
we
submit
has
never,
ever
been
raised
in
the
state
courts.
so,
we
submit
that
this
issue
is
not
properly
before
the
court.
i
would
also
indicate
that
the
question
is
whether
counsel
was
ineffective
in
failing
to
raise
the
claim
on
appeal,
thereby
meeting
the
cause
prong
of
wainwright
versus
sykes.
the
petitioner
refers
to
the
fourth
circuit
ruling
in
gibson
versus
zahradnick.
the
author
of
that
opinion
was
chief
justice
hainsworth.
it
is
notable
that
in
a
subsequent
case,
conquiss
versus
mitchell,
judge
hainsworth
indicated
that
gibson
versus
zahradnick
did
not
apply
in
those
circumstances
where
the
defendant
retained
a
private
psychiatrist.
now,
in
the
conquiss
case
were
the
same
facts
as
this
case.
the
defendant
came
in
and
asked
the
court
to
appoint
a
private
psychiatrist.
the
court
merely
entered
an
order
so
that
the
psychiatrist
could
be
paid,
but
the
court
did
not
choose
the
psychiatrist,
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
other
than
entering
the
order
for
the
payment.
those
are
precisely
the
same
facts
in
this
case.
at
the
state
habeas
hearing,
the
trial
judge
indicated
that
the
only
thing
he
had
to
do
with
the
psychiatrist,
dr.
pile
in
this
case,
was
simply
to
enter
the
order
to
allow
him
to
be
paid.
the
judge
did
not
select
him,
did
not
require
him
to
be
examined.
we
think
that
the
facts
are
identical
here.
we
would
also
submit
that
in
this
case
there
is
no
question,
and
as
mr.
snook
has
conceded
today,
as
he
had
in
the
fourth
circuit,
this
evidence
in
no
way
had
any
effect
upon
the
separate
and
distinct
finding
of
vileness.
i
would
also
note
that
this
evidence
is
not
evidence
which
would
mislead
the
jury.
it
is
not
evidence
which
is
erroneous
because
there
is
no
question
but
this
evidence
was
in
fact
true.
so,
to
try
to
indicate
that
this
evidence
which
the
jury
could
have
heard
if
we
assume
for
a
minute
that
there
would
be
something
wrong
with
dr.
pile
testifying,
which
we
do
not
concede,
but
just
assuming
it,
the
jury
could
clearly
have
heard
the
same
type
of
evidence,
the
same
exact
statement
about
the
bus
incident
from
some
other
declarant.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
justice
stevens--
mr.
james
e.
kulp
--no,
sir,
we
don't
really
say
that.
i
think
that--
mr.
james
e.
kulp
--well,
i
think
in
this
case
that
the
evidence
is
so
clear
on
the
aggravating
circumstance
of
vileness
that
whether
this
evidence
had
been
introduced
or
not
introduced,
or
whether
you
had
had
any
finding
or
any
evidence
at
all--
mr.
james
e.
kulp
--yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
viewed
the
case
in
the
context
that
the
evidence
of
the
bus
incident
had
nothing
to
do
whatsoever
with
the
vileness
finding.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
well,
i
don't...
justine
stevens,
i
don't
think
that
just
any
type
of
evidence
would
call
for
a
harmless
error
rationale
necessarily.
i
think
that
obviously
hypotheticals
could
be
thought
up
where,
as
mr.
snook
indicates,
a
prosecutor
could
simply
open
the
door
and
try
to
put
in
everything
that
the
court
would
allow,
and
we
don't
really
try
to
suggest
that
that
would
be
permissible.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
well,
i
think--
mr.
james
e.
kulp
--i
think,
though,
that
in
zant
the
court
recognized
at
least
in
a
footnote
in
barclay
versus
florida
the
court
indicated
that
it
had
applied
federal
harmless
error
standard
in
zant,
and
i
think
that
what
the
court
did
in
barclay
is
a
similar
situation
as
to
what
the
fourth
circuit
did
here.
that
is,
one
of
the
underlying
rationales
in
zant
was
the
fact
that
there
was
mandatory
appellate
review
which
we
have
in
virginia
just
like
it
was
in
georgia.
and
i
would
point
out,
and
i
think
this
is
very
significant,
when
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
on
direct
appeal
reviewed
this
very
case,
when
it
talked
about
dangerousness,
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
never
considered
this
bus
incident.
i
think
that
is
important,
because
i
think
that
simply
goes
to
the
overall
way
the
case
has
come
about
is
that
i
think
everyone,
the
fourth
circuit
as
well
as
the
virginia
supreme
court,
has
considered
that
that
evidence
was
just
inconsequential,
and
had
no
impact.
now,
the
fourth
circuit
did
not
specifically
say
harmless
error.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
well,
i
think
that--
mr.
james
e.
kulp
--well,
that
is
what
they
said,
and
that
is
basically
what
the
virginia
supreme
court
has
said
in
the
case
that
mr.
snook
mentioned.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
i
don't
want
to
limit
myself,
justice
stevens--
mr.
james
e.
kulp
--to
just
that
argument,
because
if
this
court
should
not
accept
that
rationale,
then
we
think
we
have
a
harmless
error
argument,
so
we
would
certainly
take
the
position
that
the
fourth
circuit--
mr.
james
e.
kulp
--well,
i
think
you
can,
justice
stevens,
read
the
fourth
circuit
opinion,
and
the
reason
i
say
that
is
because
in
one
of
the
footnotes
they
talked
about
the
counsel,
they
didn't
believe
that
counsel
probably
was
ineffective
because
they
said
we
don't
think
that
there
was
any
prejudice,
and
i
believe,
and
if
you
look
at
the
district
court
opinion,
they
clearly
found
no
prejudice
from
the
failure
to
raise
the
fifth
amendment
issue.
so,
i
think
that
it
is
there.
they
didn't
specifically
use
it
in
the
terms
of
harmless
error,
but
i
do
think
it
is
there.
and
we
would
submit
that
the
defendant
or
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
basically
trying
to
ask
the
supreme
court
to
be
the
court
of
record
to
decide
this
issue
for
the
first
time.
the
virginia
supreme
court
never
had
an
opportunity
to
look
at
this
situation
at
all,
and
the
federal
district
court
clearly
held
that
it
was
waived
under
wainwright
versus
sykes,
and
we
believe
in
fact
that
it
was.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
i
don't
think
it
is
absolutely
clear.
i
think
that
in
gibson
there
you
have--
mr.
james
e.
kulp
--i
think
that
the
admissibility,
of
this
evidence
would
really
come
under
the
conquiss
versus
mitchell
case,
not
the
gibson
case,
and
the
reason
i
say
that
is
because
in
gibson
the
facts
were
that
the
court
ordered
the
examination.
and
they
said
there
that
fifth
amendment
privilege
would...
that
the
prosecution
could
not
use
in
its
case
in
chief
ever.
but
i
submit
that
a
reading
of
what
judge
hainsworth
said
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
conquiss
was
that
that
does
not...
gibson
simply
does
not
apply
to
a
fact
situation
where
in
this
case,
as
it
was
in
conquiss,
the
defendant
comes
in
and
asks
the
court
to
appoint
him
a
private
psychiatrist,
whom
he
names,
and
all
the
court
does
is
simply
enter
the
order
to
allow
him
to
be
paid.
in
other
words,
there
is
no
state
action
involved
in
this
case
to
call
for
a
fifth
amendment
application.
and
so
i
think
that
while
judge
hainsworth
is
in
the
concurring
opinion
there...
that
is
why
i
say
i
am
not
sure
that
they
have
cleared
that
up.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
i
don't
think
they
did.
i
think
they--
mr.
james
e.
kulp
--they
may
have,
your
honor.
i
just
can't
read
that
with
any
assurance,
and
we
cited
conquiss
to
them,
and
i
say,
you
read
the
opinion,
and
i
don't
think
they
really
resolved
the
issue.
i
think
what
they
did
is,
they
felt
there
simply
was
no
reason
to
get
embroiled
in
that,
and...
we
asked
them
to
accept
our
argument
on
labor,
and
for
some
reason
they
sort
of
bypassed
that
and
just
said,
well,
we
don't
have
to
get
to
that
because
we
had
the
one
untainted
aggravating
circumstance,
and
under
virginia
law
and
under
zant
that
is
sufficient.
so,
for
those
reasons,
we
would
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
holding
of
the
fourth
circuit.
