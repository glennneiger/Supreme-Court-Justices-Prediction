justice
white
could
i
ask
you,
is
there
some...
was
there
any
challenge
to
the
aggravating...
the
vileness
aggravating
circumstance?
justice
white
and
that
was
sustained
by
the
fourth
circuit,
and
everyone
has
sustained
that.
justice
white
and
so
the
only
problem
is
the
future
dangerousness?
justice
white
well,
the
forth
circuit
certainly
decided
that
as
long
as
the
vileness
aggravating
circumstance
was
left
undisturbed,
it
was
quite
proper
to
sustain
the
death
penalty.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
insofar
as
it
was
an
interpretation
of
virginia
law,
we
certainly
accept
it.
justice
white
that
may
be,
but
has
there
been
since?
justice
white
at
least
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
thought
that
it
would
be
wholly
consistent
with
virginia
law
to
sustain
a
death
penalty
on
the
basis
of
one
of
two
aggravating
circumstances.
justice
white
they
acted
on
it,
didn't
they?
they
certainly
acted
on
that.
it
would
have
been
strange
if
they...
because
they
put
aside
your
whole
point
based
on
the
psychiatric
testimony.
they
just
put
it
aside
because
that
was
essentially
irrelevant
as
long
as
the
vileness
aggravating
circumstance--
justice
white
--well,
the
point
the
evidence
being
admissible,
the
inadmissible
evidence
here
only
went
to
one
aggravating
circumstance.
justice
white
do
you
think
zant...
you
think
zant
is
contrary
to
the
way
they
interpret
this?
justice
white
well,
there
is
no
question
that
the
fourth
circuit
thought
that
the
death
penalty
should
be
sustained
because
of
the
single
circumstance.
justice
white
i
understand.
i
understand,
but
certainly
fourth
circuit
thought
that
this
would
be
consistent
with
virginia
law.
justice
white
yes,
but
you
are
raising
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
death...
under
virginia
law
the
death
penalty
should
be
sustained
when
the
jury
has
found
two
circumstances
and
one
of
them
washes
out.
justice
white
you
are
saying
that
you
really
don't
know
what
should
happen
under
virginia
law,
whether
there
should
be
a
new
sentencing
hearing
or
not.
justice
white
a
federal
violation
that
only
want
to
one
of
the
aggravating
circumstances.
justice
white
and
you
are
saying
that
that
should
taint
the
finding
of
the
other
aggravating
circumstance?
justice
white
what
should
it
be?
justice
white
because
there
was
the
violation,
you
automatically
set
aside
the
death
penalty.
justice
white
so
you
do
get
back
to
virginia
law.
justice
white
you
would
still
have
to
be
then
arguing
that
the
federal
violation
tainted
the
vileness
finding
and
hence
the
virginia
supreme
court
could
not
write
this
kind
of
opinion.
justice
white
yes,
but
the
evidence
that
came
in
wasn't
the
least
bit
relevant
to
the
finding
of
vileness.
justice
white
not
in
the
least.
and
so
in
finding
vileness
the
jury
made
inadmissible
evidence
which
couldn't
have
had
any
effect.
justice
white
--the
fourth
circuit
law
is
clear
on
the
admissibility
of
this
evidence,
or
not?
justice
white
under
gibson
how
would
the
admissibility
of
this
evidence
be
decided?
justice
white
what
did
the
fourth
circuit...
how
do
you
think...
the
fourth
circuit
said
it
didn't
want
to
avoid
deciding
the
merits
in
this
case
and
then
promptly
didn't
decide
it.
justice
white
you
would
have
thought
they...
i
gathered
from
what
they
wrote
that
they
thought...
this
panel
thought
gibson
controlled--
