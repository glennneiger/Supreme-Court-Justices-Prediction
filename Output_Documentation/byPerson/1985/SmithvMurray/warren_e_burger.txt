we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
smith
against
murray.
mr.
snook,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
what
you
are
suggesting
is
that
that
should
be
treated
the
same
way
under
the
same
rules
as
though
it
had
been
offered
by
the
prosecution
in
the
case
in
chief
where
guilt
was--
chief
justice
burger
are
you
suggesting,
mr.
snook,
that
in
the
penalty
hearing
at
the
second
stage
the
same
rules
of
evidence
apply
across
the
board
as
in
the
basic
prosecution?
chief
justice
burger
has
the
highest
court
of
virginia
passed
on
that
issue
in
this
case?
chief
justice
burger
do
you
concede...
perhaps
you
have
answered
this
before,
but
do
you
concede
that
there
is
no
weakness
or
impairment
or
flaw
in
the
determination
of
the
vileness
and
wantonness
of
the
crime?

justice
