mr.
smart,
do
you
think
there
is
a
jurisdictional
question
at
all
in
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
youngman
and
his--

--and
his
position
in
the
case.
did
the
court
of
appeals
have
jurisdiction,
do
you
think?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and,
why
do
you
think
they
have
jurisdiction?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
smart,
in
this
case,
a
faculty
member
was
present
at
the
petros
meetings.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but,
not
participating,
is
that
the
record
evidence?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
the
record
disclose
whether
the
teachers
had
been
instructed
not
to
actively
participate?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
your
conclusion
be
the
same
if
the
teacher
had
actively
participated
in
the
meeting?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
fried,
i
know
that
you
passed
over
the
standing
of
jurisdiction
question
and
referred
to
the
passage
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief
on
the
subject.
is
it
your
view
that
a
student
who
does
not
allege
a
desire
to
attend
a
petros
meeting
has
standing
to
complain
about
the
fact
that
the
school
is
holding
such
meetings
or
permitting
them
if
nothing
else
appears?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but,
we
don't
know
that
any
of
them
are
before
us,
do
we?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right.
but,
on
the
other
side,
where
we
are
concerned
about
mr.
youngman's
standing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
in
judging
the
effect
of
a
particular
course
of
conduct
for
establishment
clause
purposes,
wouldn't
we
apply
an
objective
test
that
would
ask
what
a
reasonable
student
would
think?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
a
reasonable
person's
standard,
not
one
that
is
geared
either
to
the
high
or
the
low
end
of
the
spectrum
or
to
individual
problems.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if
the
school
policy
were
that
we
will
have
an
activities
period
and
it
is
open
only
to
secular
groups
to
meet.
can
the
school
do
that,
not
considering
the
act
passed
by
congress
that
might
superimpose
some
different
standard
today.
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
doctrine,
could
the
school
do
this?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
smart,
under
your
view,
would
the
board
have
to
permit
some
group
such
as
sons
of
satan
or
whatever
it
might
be
that
would
be
entirely
anti-religious
to
come
and
meet?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
a
neo-nazi
party?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
both
parties
here
agree
that
in
this
instance
an
open
forum
had
been
created?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
both
sides.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
perhaps
it
isn't
necessary
in
this
case
to
wrestle
with
all
those
problems.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
only
barrier
is
the
establishment
clause
now?
