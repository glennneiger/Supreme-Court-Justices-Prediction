justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
how
does
that
bear
on
the
issues.
you
sued
him
in
his
official
capacity,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
there
any
framing
of
liability
against
him
individually
in
any
sense?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
is
it
relevant
that
he
has
got
a
child
in
the
school.
could
any
parent
have
appealed
this
judgment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
mccollum
case,
wasn't
there
an
allegation
that
the
child
was
being
offended
in
some
way
by
these
practices?
nobody
says
mr.
youngmen's
children
are
unhappy
in
any
way,
are
they?
is
there
anything
in
the
record
about
his
children?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
smart--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
that
is
your
position,
supposing
the
time
that
is
devoted
to
this
activity
is
needed
to
qualify
the
school
for
its
academic
diplomas
and
all
the
rest,
and
as
i
understand,
you
can't
tell
from
the
record
whether
it
is
counted
or
not.
the
court
of
appeals
said
they
couldn't
tell
whether
the
activity
periods
count
toward
the
minimum
requirement
for
powers
of
the
school
under
the
state
statute.
now,
if
it
is
required,
then
would
it
not
be
state
action?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
that
is
your
position,
why
would
it
matter
if
the
monitor
was
an
employee
of
the
school
and
who
directed
the
activity?
i
don't
understand
how
you
reconcile
that
with
your
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
issue
as
you
put
it
is
whether
it
is
state
action
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and,
if
it
is
action
that
is
necessary
in
order
to
have
these
students
be
qualified
for
a
state
diploma,
why
is
it
not
state
action?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
fried,
may
i
ask
if
the
federal
interest
would
be
adequately
satisfied
by
a
decision
that
the
appellant
here
didn't
have
standing
to
appeal
and
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
vacated?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
not
sure
of
what
your
answer
is.
you
don't
think
the
federal
interest
would
be
adequately
vindicated
by
vacating
the
decision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
you
would
rather
have
an
advisory--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
do,
mr.
fried,
if
you
have
a
moment.
you
pointed
out
that
this
activity
was
entirely
initiated
by
the
students.
to
what
extent
was
that
point
litigated
in
the
court
below?
did
the
defendants
take
any
discovery
from
the
plaintiffs
of
any
kind
or
put
in
any
evidence
or
did
they
just
more
or
less
go
along
with
the
plaintiffs'
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
petitioners...
i
am
sorry,
go
ahead.
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
any
pleading
filed
other
than
the
one
answer
by
the
school
board
as
an
entity?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
surfaced
at
the
time
of
the
notice
of
appeal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
fried,
were
they
doing
that
at
the
time
the
appeal
was
taken?
they
were
not
as
i
understand
the
record.
they
permitted
them
to
meet.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
at
the
time
the
appeal
was
taken,
what
was
the
controversy?
who
was
fighting
with
whom?
was
there
any
allegation
that
any
non-petros
child
was
offended
by
these
meetings?
justice
john
paul
stevens
where
in
the
record
do
you
find
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and,
did
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
grant
any
relief
against
you
in
your
individual
capacity?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
one
reads
the
judgment,
one
cannot
find
any
relief
against
you
as
an
individual.
well,
you
got
a
declaratory
judgment.
there
was
a
declaratory
judgment
entered,
wasn't
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
must
be
relying
on
kentucky
against
graham.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
must
be
relying
on
kentucky
against
graham
which
clearly
makes
you
not
liable
for
fees.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and,
that
is
in
his
capacity
as
a
member
of...
in
his
official
capacity
of--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and,
he
can
speak
for
the
entire
board?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
to
impose
a
liability
for
fees
and
costs
on
the
board
itself,
one
person
can
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
say
impose
it.
do
you
know
of
any
other
situation
in
which
one
member
of
a
board
has
been
able
to
litigate
on
behalf
of
the
entire
board
when
the
rest
of
the
board
takes
the
opposite
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
one
more
question
and
then
i
won't
take
any
more
of
your
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
prior
to
your
filing
the
notice
of
appeal
in
this
case,
had
you
independently
taken
any
action
or
had
anybody
on
the
school
board
taken
any
action
to
resist
the
claim
other
than
to
file
an
answer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
by
fighting,
did
they
take
any
depositions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
whose
deposition
did
they--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
plaintiffs'
lawyer
took
the
deposition
of
the
principal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
the
defendants'
lawyer
take
any
depositions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
youngman,
in
defending
this
case,
was
any
effort
made
to
bring
out
evidence
that
would
support
the
suggestion
you
are
making
that
some
of
the
high
school
students
would
perceive
endorsement?
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
that,
is
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
nobody
in
the
trial
of
the
case
thought
it
important
enough--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but,
mr.
youngman,
isn't
it
true
that
this
program
was
permitted
to
operate
for
about
a
year
after
the
district
court
decision
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
anybody
was
even
remotely
unhappy
about
it
in
any
way,
got
any
misperceptions
or
anything.
nobody
thought
to
supplement
the
record
after
the
program
had
been
going
for
a
year
either.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
record
tell
us
anything
about
the
attendance
during
that
year,
how
popular
the
group
was?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
was
at
the
very
first
meeting.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
were
about
20
at
the
second
meeting
and
they
met
for
a
year.
do
we
know
how
many
people
during
the
year--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--we
don't
know
if
it
is
two
or
three
or
twenty
or
thirty.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
smart,
do
you
take
the
position
your
clients
have
the
right
to
use
the
bulletin
boards
as
the
other
activity
groups
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
they
haven't
sought
it,
but
assume
they
did
seek
it.
would
they
not
have
the
same
right
as
others
and,
if
not,
why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
smart,
does
the
record
contain
the
legal
opinion
on
which
the
school
board
relied?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
record
contain
the
legal
opinion
on
which
the
school
board
relied?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
but,
the
opinion
itself
was
not
put
in
record?
