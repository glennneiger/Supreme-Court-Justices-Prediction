mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
facts
of
this
case
are
not
extremely
complicated,
but
they
can
be
misunderstood.
this
case
does
not
involved
teacher-led
or
government-prescribed
religious
activities.
very
simply,
students
from
williamsport
area
high
school,
which
we
represent,
wanted
to
meet
during
the
extracurricular
activity
period.
the
school
was
originally
content
to
let
them
meet.
then
permission
was
withdrawn
after
the
first
meeting,
but
solely
because
the
school's
lawyer
felt
that
allowing
student
meetings
containing
prayer
and
religious
expression
would
violate
the
establishment
clause.
now,
since
the
lawyer's
belief
was
the
only
reason
for
the
denial
of
meeting
space
in
this
case,
the
legal
issue
is
very
narrow
and
that
is
simply
whether
the
establishment
clause
requires
a
high
school
to
censor
out
the
religious
expression
of
private
individuals
after
having
first
created
an
opportunity
for
students
to
engage
in
their
own
self-initiated
activities
and
expression.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
by
that,
do
you
mean
by
that--
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
--all
right.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
in
our
opinion,
they
did,
your
honor,
and
the
case
is
properly
here.
it
is
a
valid
case
or
controversy.
however--
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
--well,
it
was
our
judgment
that
mr.
youngman
probably
stood
in
the
same
position
as
mrs.
bashdi
mccollum
in
the
mccollum
case
in
1948
as
a
parent.
but,
if
the
court
should
decide
that
mr.
youngman
does
not
have
standing,
the
correct
disposition
of
this
case
would
be
to
vacate
the
third
circuit
decision
and
reinstate
the
decision
of
the
district
court.
now,
it
is
important
to
understand
that
in
this--
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
--mr.
youngman
is
no
longer
a
member
of
the
school
board,
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
he
has
a
child
in
the
williamsport
area
high
school.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
i
believe
his
child
is
in
the
ninth
grade,
if
i
am
not
mistaken.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
not
that
i
am
aware
of,
your
honor.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
in
reviewing
the
mccollum
case,
it
appeared
that
that
was
the
case,
but
we
would
be
quite
content--
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
--i
don't
know
the
details
on
that,
your
honor.
we
felt
he
would
be
able
to
repair
his
case
if
that
issued
was
raised.
if
we
were
in
error,
we
would
be
quite
pleased
to
have
the
district
court
decision
in
this
case
reinstated
since
it
was
in
favor
of
our
clients.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
he
was
a
member
of
the
school
board
in
the
district
court.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
he
is
no
longer
a
member
of
the
school
board.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
so.
i
believe
it
would
have
been
a
valid
decision
at
the
district
court
level
since
all
parties
were
properly
represented.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
well,
if
that
were
the
case,
then
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
two
options
if
that
were
the
law,
your
honor.
one
would
be
to
treat
it
as
a
case
or
controversy
that
is
capable
of
repetition,
yet
evading
review,
or
to
wash
the
whole
thing
out.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
i
believe
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
believe
that--
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
--no,
your
honor,
he
did
not.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
however,
they
do
decide
what
course
the
school
district
takes
and
the
respondent
is
here
in
the
capacity
as
an
original
member
of
this
lawsuit
against
whom
we
sought
individual
liability,
including
attorney's
fees,
and
he
has
represented
that
he
is
in
this
lawsuit
at
this
point
as
a
parent.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
our
view
of
the
mccollum
case.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
we
believe
he
is
still
in
the
case
and
we
believe
it
is
still
a
valid
case
or
controversy.
it
is
important
to
understand
that
in
this
case
the
record
shows
that
the
school
did
not
simply
make
available
certain
specified
activities
to
the
students
during
this
activity
period.
the
school
did
not
say,
students,
you
can
do
this,
this,
or
this,
take
your
pick
of
those.
instead,
the
school
said
to
the
students,
students,
you
decide
what
you
will
do
during
the
activity
period.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
we
think
that
constitutionally
it
is
indistinguishable,
your
honor.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
that
is
exactly
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
they
were
free
entirely
to
conduct
their
meetings
as
they
saw
fit.
we
believe
that
the
district
court
findings
in
this
case,
that
that
was
the
case
in
the
williamsport
area
high
school,
and
are
correct;
that
the
school
district--
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
--no,
your
honor.
the
only
reason
they
couldn't
do
that
is
because
the
school
requires
them
to
remain
in
the
building,
as
i
understand
it,
and
that
is
part
of
the
reason
for
having
all
the
activities,
as
i
understand
it,
inside
the
building
unless
perhaps
there
is
special
permission
to
go
outside.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
your
honor,
our
case
concerns
only
age
14,
grade
nine
through
twelve.
fourteen
through
18
are
the
ages.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
no,
it...
well,
it
would
depend
on
whether
the
school
had
created
a
free-speech
opportunity
for
the
students
through
some
kind
of
self-initiated
activity
forum.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
no.
probably
the
closest
you
would
get
in
elementary
school
to
a
student-initiated
activity
forum
would
be
recess.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
i
think
that
there
is
going
to
be...
of
course,
the
third
circuit
and
the
court
of
appeals
was
concerned
about
the
impressionability
and
age
of
students
and
i
would
have
to
frankly
admit
that
i
think
there
is
some
age
at
which
any
sort
of
religious
activities
going
on
may
reasonably
be
interpreted
by
a
student
as
having
been
sponsored
by
the
school.
for
instance,
the
case
judge
friendly
decided
involving
the
kindergarten
students
where
there
was
a
claim
that
they
should
be
allowed
to
say
a
prayer
before
grace.
if
the
teacher
leads
them
in
that
prayer,
why,
it
is
not
going
to
be
a
voluntary
prayer.
at
that
age,
nothing
is
voluntary
to
those
students
unless
they
are
maladjusted
students.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
that
is
exactly
the
record
evidence,
your
honor.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
the
record
does
not
disclose
that,
although
i
think
it
is
clear
that
that
is
what
did
happen.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
the
crucial
constitutional
distinction
is
the
distinction
between
state
action
or
government
action
and
individual
action
and
that
the
only
safe
harbor
of
constitutional
analysis
is
that
distinction
between
is
the
government
acting
in
promoting
or
conducting
this
activity
or
are
private
individuals
acting
and
what
is
the
government's
role?
we
must
look
at
the
government's
role.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
i
don't
see
that
that
is
a
significant
constitutional
connection,
your
honor.
if
the
school
in
this
case
determined
that
they
wanted
to
take
credit
for
the
activity
period
and
to
apply
it,
that
certainly
was
their
prerogative
to
do
so
because
there
is
educational
value
even
in
self-initiated
student
activities.
however,
there
has
been
no
adjudication--
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
--i
am
not
sure
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
the
state
action
consists
of
having
them
on
the
premises
in
the
question
that
you
put
forth.
the
state
action
you
want
to
focus
on
is
who
is
doing
the
religious
activity,
who
is
promoting
it,
who
is
sponsoring
it,
who
is
encouraging
people
to
participate?
if
the
state
is
doing
that,
then
it
would
violate
the
constitution.
but,
all
the
state
has
done
here
is
to
require
these
people
to
go
to
school,
these
students
to
be
at
school
between
certain
hours.
now,
not
everything
that
goes
on
in
the
school
grounds
during
those
hours
makes
them
a
captive
audience
to
that
activity
on
the
school.
in
fact,
there
is
an
inherent
competition
during
this
activity
period
between
all
of
the
activities
that
are
going
on.
a
student
has
to
choose
what
he
will
do
during
that
time
and
he
can
even
choose
to
start
new
activities
during
that
time
if
he
doesn't
like
any
of
the
existing
ones
that
are
going
on.
and,
that
is
where
we
get
the
free-speech
opportunity
for
these
students
that
was
created
and
that
is
how
we
draw
the
distinction
between
the
government
action
in
the
case
and
the
individual,
private
action
in
the
case.
and,
this
is
a
crucial
distinction.
any
departure
from
the
distinction
on
government
action
versus
private
action
will
get
us
into
constitutional
difficulty.
it
will
get
us
into
problems
with
excessive
entanglement
as
we
try
to
determine
what
students
are
doing
at
their
meeting.
are
they
too
religious
at
this
meeting,
are
they
talking
too
much
about
religion,
do
they
have
an
invocation,
that
sort
of
thing.
it
will,
furthermore,
put
us
in
the
problem
of
having
to
tell
these
students
that
we
cannot
allow
your
meeting
because,
you
see,
if
we
have
a
neutral
policy,
then
somebody
might
think
that
we
are
sponsoring
your
activity.
so,
we
can't
have
a
neutral
policy.
we
have
to
have
a
non-neutral
policy.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
clear
from
the
record
the
teacher
was
there
and
was
instructed
to
simply
be
there
in
case
of
an
emergency,
to
make
sure
the
students
were
there
and
don't
leave,
that
type
of
situation.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
couldn't
it
be
accomplished
in
the
hallways?
no,
your
honor,
they
have--
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
--that
is
right,
your
honor,
and
that
is
an
excellent
point,
your
honor.
and,
these
students
met
in
the
cafeteria
and
the
doors...
if
there
were
any
doors...
could
be
secured
and
the
teacher
could
be
in
the
hallway.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
your
honor,
the
teacher
was
grading
tests
during
this
time
and
i
think
that
is
pretty--
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
--well,
it
is
the
duty
of
the
school
district
to
keep
the
students
on
the
premises.
if
a
fight
breaks
out
in
any
respect
or
the
students
start
smoking
marijuana
or
something
of
this
nature...
i
would
hope
the
students
wouldn't
do
that...
but
that...
if
there
is
something
like
that
occurs,
the
teacher
is
available
to
put
a
stop
to
that
type
of
activity.
the--
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
--there
is
a
reference
in
the
record
to
the
teacher
taking
the
roll,
although
i
think
that
what
actually
happened
was
that
the
students
signed
a
roster
in
actuality.
the
school
has
a
practice
of
having
a
teacher
or
school
employee
present
in
all
areas
of
the
building
where
there
are
students.
there
are
teachers
stationed
in
the
hallways
between
periods
and
during
this
activity
period.
that
doesn't
mean
they
are
monitoring
with
the
speech
of
the
students
in
the
hallway
or
censoring
the
speech
of
the
students,
it
simply
means
that
they
are
there
to
take
care
of
any
need
that
might
arise
and
to
keep
the
students
on
the
premises.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
that
is
my
understanding,
your
honor.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
i
think
that
fits
the
record
in
this
case.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
if
you
look
at
the
purpose
of
the
activity
period,
it
is
not
a
curricular
activity
period,
it
is
an
extra-curricular
period,
and--
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
--it
is
my
understanding
that
it
does.
however,
i
would
urge
on
the
court
the
fact
that
the
school
district
itself
calls
these
periods
extra-curricular
and
i
think
the
curricular
and
the
non-curricular--
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
--well,
i
think
the
curricular/non-curricular
distinction
is
a
distinction
this
court
has
used
in
the
past.
for
instance,
in
the
school
library
case,
the
board
of
education
of
island
trees
school
district
versus
pico
the
court
did
not
look
at
the
hours
the
students
had
to
be
at
the
school.
the
court
drew
the
distinction
between
the
curricular
activities
and
the
non-curricular
activities.
and,
the
position
of
this
court
has
been
that
students
have
free
speech
rights
in
the
public
school.
our
view
of
what
the
first
amendment
requires
in
a
public
school
is
not
a
highly
regimented,
dictatorial
type
of
situation
outside
of
the
classroom.
when
students
are
in
the
hallways
or
in
self-initiated
activities
or
in
the
cafeteria,
they
are
able
to
exercise
free-speech
rights.
the
school
created
that
right
here.
all
we
are
asking
is
that
you
not
exclude
one
category,
the
religious
student,
from
participation
in
that
right
simply
because
of
the
religiousness
of
it.
the
court
has
always
held
religious
speech
to
the
same
protection
as
other
forms
of
speech.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
could,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
a
few
comments,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice:
first
of
all,
i
would
like
to
disagree
with
mr.
youngman
about
the
discretion
of
the
school
administrators.
i
view
the
decision
of
the
district
court
in
this
case
resting
on
the
fact
that
the
establishment
clause
was
the
only
reason
asserted
for
denying
this
group
an
opportunity
to
meet
and
i
think
it
would
be
a
different
case--
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
--i
think
it
would
be
an
entirely
different
case.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
yes.
i
think
they
could
keep
it
out
if
they
had--
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
--no.
only
if
they
had
a
structured
activity
period,
only
if
they
had
a--
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
--yes.
and,
if
it
is
predetermined
what
the
categories
are
in
their
curricular,
then
they
could
keep
them
out.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
we
would
argue
that.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
that
they
could
articulate
a
valid
reason
for
having
only
secular
activities
once
they
have
opened
the
forum.
i
also
think
it
would
create
establishment
clause
problems
with
regard
to
excessive
entanglement
of
determining
what
is
religious
and
what
is
not
religious
as
the
court
discussed
in
the
widmar
case.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
they
would
not
have
to
abandon
the
whole
program.
i
think
they
have
a
choice
of
curricular-related
groups
that
are
an
extension
of
the
curriculum,
or
letting
the
students
decide
and
if
they
let
the
students
decide,
then
they
can't
keep
the
religious
group
out.
and,
all
we
are
saying
here
is
we
believe
they
have
opened
the
forum
and
we
are
just
asking
to
be
included
in
that.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
that
is
not
in
this
case.
our
clients
have
never
sought
that
right.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
if
our
students
had
sought
that
right,
then
i
think
this
court
would
want
to
know
more
about
the
details
of
how
that
is
administered,
who
puts
the
notices
up
there,
who
determines
what
is
up
there,
and
that
sort
of
thing.
we
would
argue
that
if
it
is
the
students
putting
the
notices
up
there,
then
the
concept
of
neutrality,
if
everyone
realizes
this
is
the
students'
bulletin
board
and
they
can
put
whatever
they
want
to
up
there,
then
the
concept
of
neutrality
requires
that
they
have
equal
access
to
that
bulletin
board.
if
there
were
more
government
involvement
in
the
board,
then
it
might
be
a
different
question.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
the
school
board
would
have
to
permit
that.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
or
a
neo-nazi
party
unless
the
school
board
can
articulate
a
compelling
interest.
and,
the
school
board
would
probably
have
two
options
in
that
regard.
number
one,
a
hate
group
or
something
of
that
nature
might
present
a
compelling
state
interest
to
keep
them
out
or
a
school
district
could
always
go
to
a
parental
consent
format
if
it
was
causing
a
lot
of
political
turmoil
for
the
school
board
to
have
such
a
group.
i
think
that
would
be
an
easier
way.
it
would
keep
the
government
from
prescribing
what
is
orthodox.
i
think
the
issue
is--
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
--did
both
parties
agree?
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
both
sides
in
the
district
court
i
think,
in
effect,
agreed
that
at
least
that
was
not
contested.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
that
is
exactly
right.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
the
only
thing
we
are
asking
this
court
is
to
decide
that
our
group
does
not
face
any
additional
barrier
because
of
the
establishment
clause.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
that
was
certainly
argued
by
mr.
youngman
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
there
was
no
public
forum
created.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
he
could
argue
that.
the
fact
is
that
the
only
reason
that
the
school
district
said
that
we
can't
meet
is
because
of
the
establishment
clause.
they
did
not
say,
well,
we
think
that
this
in
inappropriate--
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
--excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
it
does
not
contain
the
letter
from
the
attorney,
however,
we
do
have
a
recitation
in
the
record
from
the
superintendent
of
what
the
attorney
said.
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
the
opinion
itself
is
not
in
the
record,
but
it
is
clear
from
the
record
that
the
opinion
of
the
attorney
concerning
the
establishment
clause
was
the
only
reason
and
i
think
that
it
would
be
a
different
case
if
the
school
had
said
it
is
inappropriate
for
this
reason
or
that
reason
or
some
other
reason.
i
think
as
lawyers--
mr.
james
madison
smart,
jr.
--thank
you,
your
honor.
