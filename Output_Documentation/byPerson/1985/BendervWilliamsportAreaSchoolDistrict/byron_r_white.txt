justice
byron
r.
white
why
would
that
be
the
result?
there
still
wouldn't
be
a
case
of
controversy
even
in
the
district
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
is
no
longer.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
suppose
the
court
of
appeals
said
a
piece
of
controversy
has
just
washed
out,
wouldn't
it
have
directed
the
district
court
to
dismiss
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
he
could
have
been
a
plaintiff
in
the
case
originally?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
think
he
is
still
in
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
a
judgment
you
didn't
agree
with.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
if
you
were
going
to
obey
the
law,
you
were
stuck
with
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
and,
if
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
were
reversed
and
the
thing
should
go
back
to
the
district
court,
saying
that
the
procedure
were
consistent
with
the
constitution,
is
there
any
possibility
then
that
the
district
court
might
grant
further
relief
against
you
such
as
attorney's
fees?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
did
he
ever
become
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
think
that
here
he
is
now
a
respondent?
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
if
we
don't
do
that,
do
you
lose
or
do
you
have
other
grounds?
justice
byron
r.
white
--what
if
the
student
group
wasn't
going
to
have
a
debate
about
the
budget
but
it
was
students
against
taxation
and
they
wanted
to
have
their
meeting
like
all
the
other
groups
around
and
that
is
how
they
can
oppose
taxation?
now,
suppose
the
school
approved,
sent
an
advisor
there,
take
the
roll,
do
you
think
that
the
public
would
think
that
the
views
expressed
at
that
meeting
were
the
school's
views?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
makes
you
think
that
the
ordinary
member
of
the
public
would
think
that
the
views
expressed
at
this...
what
is
the
name
of
the
group,
petros?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
would
the
public
think
that
the
views
expressed
there
were
the
school's?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
all
right,
the
students.
do
you
think
the
students
in
my
other
example...
do
you
think
the
other
students
would
think
the
school
was
espousing
the
views
expressed
at
that
meeting
against
taxation
of
any
kind?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
that
too.
that
the
students
would
think
the
school
was
fundamentally
endorsing
a
cancellation
of--
justice
byron
r.
white
--taxation
and
even
though
the
school's
life
depends
on
it.
[laughter]
that
is
kind
of
silly,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
in
the
next
room
beside...
along
side
the
group
of
against
all
taxation
is
a
group
that
is...
it
is
called
the
committee
for
fair
taxation
and
they...
supporting
taxation.
now,
which
group
is
another
student
going
to
think
the
school
is
endorsing?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
some
might
think
one
and
some
might
think
the
other.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
of
appeals
certainly
made
a
lot
of
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
youngman,
suppose
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
school
board
says,
well,
even
if
this
is
not
an
establishment,
we
nevertheless
don't
want
the
group
to
meet
and
we
are
perfectly
free
to
do
that
just
as
our
own
decision.
would
the
district
court's
decision
stand
as
a
bar
to--
justice
byron
r.
white
--so,
the
free-speech
interest
would
get
them
into
the
school
regardless
of
the
wishes
of
the
school?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
that
is
what
the
two
courts
below
said.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
that
under
the...
would
you
say
that
if
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
the
school
board
could
nevertheless
keep
your
group
out?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
isn't
what
i
asked
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean
despite
their
free-speech
interest?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes,
there
is
a
structured
activity
period,
isn't
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
there
is
a
forum
in
the
school,
you
would
think
your
group
should
be
able
to
get
in.
you
would
think
the
first
amendment
would
require
them
to
get
in.
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
wasn't
an
issue
in
the
court
of
appeals
whether
any
kind
of
an
open
forum
had
been
created
at
all,
because
the
court
of
appeals
certainly
spent
a
lot
of
time
discussing
it
and
saying,
yes,
there
is
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
i
suppose,
in
support
of
the
judgment
below,
he
could
argue
it
here.
