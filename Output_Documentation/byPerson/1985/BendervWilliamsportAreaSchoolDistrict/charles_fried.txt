mr.
charles
fried
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
federal
interest
in
this
case
is
direct
and
substantial.
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
correct
and
the
respondents
are
correct
that
the
establishment
clause
forbids
what
these
students
chose
to
do,
wanted
to
do,
that
the
school
authorities
were
perfectly
willing
to
have
them
do
until
the
lawyer
said
otherwise,
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
correct,
then
the
subsequently
enacted
equal
access
act
is
under
grave
constitutional
doubt.
mr.
charles
fried
the
doubt
which
the
court
of
appeals
has
raised
about
the
act
would
still
be
there.
the
decision
itself
would
have
been
vacated
and
we
would
have
to
wait
another
case
in
which
the
matter
would
be
litigated.
mr.
charles
fried
i
would
not,
sir.
the
case
is
a
puzzle.
mr.
charles
fried
the
cloud
would
still
be
there,
justice
stevens.
mr.
charles
fried
on
the
jurisdictional
point,
justice
stevens,
we
do
discuss
that
on
page
five
of
our
brief.
it
is
fairly
intricate.
i
would
like
to
proceed
to
the
rather
puzzling
point
in
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
one
wonders
why
in
this
case
we
have
had
the
new
notion
introduced
that
free
speech
has
got
to
be
balanced
against
the
establishment
clause
and,
indeed,
that
free
speech
must
yield
to
the
establishment
clause.
this
case
is
not
like
wallace
and
jaffree
last
term
or
stone
v.
graham
where
the
court
could
point
to
a
state
statute
which
the
court
concluded
sought
by
direction
or
indirection
to
endorse
religion.
and,
indeed,
this
case
is
easier,
should
be
viewed
as
easier
than
its
older
twin
brother,
widmar
against
vincent,
because
in
widmar
the
state
had
reasons
of
its
own,
quite
apart
from
the
federal
establishment
clause,
for
wishing
to
limit
the
access
of
those
students
to
their
religious
activities.
here,
the
controverted
action...
the
controverted
activity
was
entirely
student
initiated
and
there
was
no
state
objection
apart
from
the
lawyer's
objection
based
on
the
federal
establishment
clause.
so,
here
we
have
no
endorsement
of
religious
and
we
have
no
conflict
with
a
substantive
state
educational
policy.
if
you
compare
this
case
to
cases
of
incidental,
but
permissible
state
involvement,
tax
exemption
in
walz,
school
books
and
text
books
for
parochial
school
students,
or
the
use
of
the
mall
for
a
papal
mass,
one
sees
that
the
objective
involvement
of
the
state
is
virtually
negligible.
so,
how
is
it
that
this
case
is
thought
to
present
these
agonizing
constitutional
difficulties.
only
on
one
premise
and
that
is
that
high
school
students
are
different.
there
is
the
fear
that
unlike
the
rest
of
us
high
school
students
are
unable
to
discern
the
difference
between
neutrality
and
endorsement.
that
is
the
fear
which
moved
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
decision
and
that
is
the
fear
which
is
raised
by
the
respondents
and
the
amici
in
this
case.
now,
whether
that
fear
is
justified,
whether
high
school
students,
indeed,
are
so
immature
that
they
cannot
make
the
distinctions
that
the
rest
of
us
make
was
a
question
which
was
specifically
addressed
by
congress.
hearings
were
held,
testimony
was
taken,
materials
were
examined.
and,
congress
concluded
that
high
school
students...
secondary
school
students
was
the
word
of
the
statute...
are
sufficiently
mature
to
make
the
same
distinctions
that
the
rest
of
us
make,
that
all
of
us
have
to
make
when
that
papal
mass
was
held
on
the
mall,
to
distinguish
between
state
endorsement
and
state
neutrality
towards
religion.
and,
this
court
has
consistently
held,
most
recently
in
rostker
and
goldberg,
that
where
congress
has
made
a
determination
of
a
controverted
matter
of
general
fact,
that
disposition
is
entitled
to
the
very
highest
degree
of
deference.
this
case
cannot
be
affirmed
without
controverting
that
congressional
judgment
about
the
maturity
of
secondary
school
students
and
rejecting
the
major
premise
of
the
equal
access
act.
that
is
why
i
say
the
federal
interest
is
direct
and
substantial.
now,
once
that
factual
premise
is
accepted,
high
school
students
do
understand
the
difference
between
neutrality
and
endorsement,
this
becomes
the
easiest
of
cases
for
we
are
far
from
any
actual
endorsement
of
religion
in
this
case.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
thank
you
for
its
attention.
mr.
charles
fried
the
petitioners
in
this
case
made--
mr.
charles
fried
--petitioners
made
that
allegation
and
it
was
not
controverted
and
it
was
the
basis
for
the
district
court's
judgment
and
for
the
judgement
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
charles
fried
not
that
i
am
aware
of.
mr.
youngman
didn't
take
any
active
part
in
the
trial,
is
that
correct?
mr.
charles
fried
i
am
not
sure
of
the
answer
to
that,
justice
stevens.
mr.
charles
fried
a
student
may
allege
an
injury
of
a
constitutional
dimension
if
that
student
alleges
that
the
going
on
of
such
activities
in
his
school
is,
as
it
were,
constitutionally
offensive
to
that
student.
but,
i
should
point
out
that
in
this
case
the
petros
students
are
still
seeking
to
meet
and
the
school
board
is
still
preventing
them
from
meeting.
mr.
charles
fried
of
the
petros
students?
mr.
charles
fried
i
believe
that
the
petros
students
are
included
among
the
class
of
petitioners,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
charles
fried
i
think
the
way
to
put
that
concern
to
rest
would
be
to
realize
that
the
school
board
is
still
preventing
petros
from
meeting.
true,
it
is
acting
like
a
disinterested
stakeholder.
they
are
saying
just
tell
us
what
we
should
do
and
we
will
do
it,
but
as
a
stakeholder,
they
are
currently
precluding
petros
from
meeting
and
that,
i
should
think,
would
be
sufficient
to
create
a
case
of--
mr.
charles
fried
--but,
after
the
appeal
and
at
this
moment--
mr.
charles
fried
--mr.
youngman,
i
believe,
at
that
time
was
claiming
on
his
behalf
as
a
parent--
mr.
charles
fried
--i
cannot
point
you
to
the
section
of
the
record.
i
believe
that
the
record
indicates
that
mr.
youngman
is
a
parent
at
the
school
and
a
former
member
of
the
school
board.
thank
you.
