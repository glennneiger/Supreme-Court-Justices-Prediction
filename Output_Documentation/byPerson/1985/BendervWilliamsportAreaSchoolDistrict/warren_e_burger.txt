we
will
hear
arguments
now
in
bender
against
williamsport
school.
mr.
smart,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice

e.

of
course,
the
school
board
doesn't
decide
the
constitutional
questions
with
finality,
do
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
the
same
as
the
widmar
factual
setting?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
speaking
narrowly.
in
the
widmar
case
did
the
students
decide
what
it
was
they
wanted
to
talk
about?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
they
wanted
to
advance
socialism,
they
could
do
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
were
free
entirely,
weren't
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
fried?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
youngman?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
record
of
appendix?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
youngman--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--you
gave
joint
appendix
33
as
a
source.
i
wonder
if
that
could
be--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--eighty-three.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
do
you
mean
by
that,
if
you
will
clear
it
up
for
me,
that
if
the
faculty
member
was
there
they
can
participate
in
the
debate
of
the
students
on
a
political
issue?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
if
the
faculty
advisor
had
republican
leanings,
he
could...
or
she...
could
influence
the
line
of
discussion,
is
that
what
you
are
suggesting?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
giving
you
a
hypothetical.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
could
have
one,
could
they
not,
a
republican
or
a
democratic
club?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but,
we
are
concerned
here
with
the
scope
of
the
authority
as
well
as
what
really
took
place.
so,
clear
that
up
for
me,
if
you
will.
could
a
group
of
students
get
together
and
say
we
want
to
meet
with
this
other
group
who
are
democrats
and
we
will
call
ourselves
republicans
and
have
a
debate.
they
could
do
that
under
this
arrangement?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
can
you
suggest
anything
in
the
program
that
prohibits
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
suggest
the
school
performs
its
function
of
getting
young
people
ready
for
citizenship
if
it
would
forbid
a
group
to
get
together,
one
asserting
a
democratic
position
and
one
asserting
a
republican
position
and
perhaps
someone
asserting
a
socialist
position?
do
you
think
they
could
prohibit
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
come
back
to
this
other
question
because
i
am
perplexed
by
your
responses.
suppose
a
group
of
students
said
we
want
to
have
one
of
these
seminars,
one
of
these
gatherings,
in
the
school
in
this
period
to
discuss
the
whole
problem
of
the
budget
deficit.
we
kids...
the
children
would
say
to
the
faculty...
we
kids
are
going
to
have
to
pay
that
and
we
would
like
to
have
a
debate
about
it.
would
that
be
permitted?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
could
you
discuss
that--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
the
standards
should
be
set
to
gauge
to
the
lowest
common
denominator,
the
retarded?
that
is
what
you
seem
to
suggest.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
who
finances
the
university
of
missouri,
taxpayers,
the
same
as
the
grade
school
and
high
school?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
a
public
school?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired
now,
mr.
youngman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
smart?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
