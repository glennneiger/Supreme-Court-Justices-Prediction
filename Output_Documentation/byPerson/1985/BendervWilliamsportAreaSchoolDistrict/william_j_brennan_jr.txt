while
you
are
on
that
subject,
mr.
youngman
is
no
longer
a
member
of
the
school
board,
is
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and,
he
no
longer
has
any
children
in
the
school?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
old?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
not,
mr.
smart?
was
not
the
vote
against
mr.
youngman's
position
in
the
board
itself
eight
to
one?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
he
had
no
support
for
his
position
at
all.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
they
would
simply
have
to
abandon
the
whole
program
to
keep
your
group
out.
