mr.
smart,
i
thought
the
record
indicated
that
the
teacher
was
there
to
take
the
roll
to
make
sure
the
students
were
present
and
then
to
remain
because
of
disciplinary
problems.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
this
question?
do
you
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
only
difference
between
this
case
and
widmar
is
the
age
of
the
students?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
without
regard
to
the
age
of
the
children?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
what
respect?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
has
to
do
with
age
though,
maturity.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
test
turns
in
this
case
solely
on
the
question
of
the
age
of
the
pupils?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
explicitly.
