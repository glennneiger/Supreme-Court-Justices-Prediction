did
they
have
to
do
something?
did
they
have
to
go
outside
and
sit
on
the
steps?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
mentioned
that
some
of
these
youngsters
were
in
the
ninth
grade.
i
think
his
present
child
was
in
the
ninth
grade.
do
you
carry
your
argument
to
the
junior
high
level
in
those
schools
which,
at
the
junior
high
level,
have
a
ninth
grade?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
suppose,
as
in
another
school
district,
your
high
school
consisted
of
grades
ten,
eleven
and
twelve
and
the
junior
high
had
nine
as
is
the
case
in
many
communities.
does
your
argument
also
carry
you
to
the
grade
nine
in
those
communities?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
then
you
would
go
down
to
the
first
and
second
grades
on
that
basis?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
suppose
they
wanted
to
play
chess.
they
had
a
couple
of
chess
prodigies
and
they
formed
a
chess
club
in
the
fifth
grade.
does
your
argument
apply?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
smart,
in
the
appendix,
pages
95
and
96,
which
is
a
deposition
apparently,
there
is
a
question:
"do
you
know
of
any...
are
there
any
school
board
policies
or
regulations
requiring
adult
supervision
of
student
clubs
or
student
groups?
"
answer:
"it
doesn't
need
to
be,
it's
covered
fairly
adequately
in
state
law.
"
"student
groups
must
be
supervised
by
a
professional
employee
of
the
commonwealth.
"
as
i
understand
your
answer,
you
are
interpreting
the
word
"supervision"
to
mean
just
presence.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
nothing
else,
just
be
there.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
hardly
the
normal
definition
of
supervision,
is
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but,
what
is
the
situation.
i
don't
think
you
answered
justice
stevens'
question.
does
this
hour
count
toward
the
required
number
of
hours
for
the
school
to
operate?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
if
it
is
required,
what
importance
is
the
nomenclature
the
school
board
puts
on
it
as
required
or
not?
