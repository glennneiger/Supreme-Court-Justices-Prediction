mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
read
to
you
the
first
paragraph
of
the
complaint
in
this
case.
"this
is
an
action
for
declaratory
judgment
and
permanent
injunction,
brought
by
students
in
the
williamsport
high
school,
through
the
parents
of
these
students
who
are
minors,
and
on
behalf
of
all
others
similarly
situated,
against
the
williamsport
area
school
district,
hereinafter,
"the
district",
the
superintendent
of
the
district,
the
president,
and
each
member
of
the
school
board
of
the
district,
in
their
individual
and
official
capacities.
"
i
was
sued
in
my
individual
as
well
as
my
official
capacity.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
that
is
still
to
be
decided,
justice
stevens.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
unless
i
appealed.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
that
is
still
to
be
decided.
there
is
a
petition
for
attorney's
fees
against
me
and
i
contend
that
i
am
not
liable
individually
for
attorney's
fees.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
what?
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
that
is
right.
furthermore,
i
wish
to
correct
a
misimpression.
my
son,
who
is
my
youngest,
is
a
junior
in
the
high
school
at
the
present
time
and
not
in
the
ninth
grade.
i
would
like
to...
furthermore,
when
standing
became
a
question
in
this
case,
a
successor
of
mine,
who
also
happens
to
be
my
minister,
agreed
to
become
respondent
in
this
case.
thus,
i
think
there
is
a
case
for
controversy.
i
think
it
exists
now
and
the
notion
that--
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
--through
supreme
court
rule
28
as
a
successor
in
interest
who
agrees
with
my
position.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
that
is
right.
that
is
in
his
official
capacity.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
no,
that
isn't
the
point.
but,
a
dissenting
board
member
has
a
right
to
speak
too
and
has
a
right
to
challenge
this
adjudication.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
well,
i
think
i
have
the
right
to
oppose
that
myself
and
i
think--
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
--no,
i
don't
presume
to
litigate
on
behalf
of
the
entire
board.
i
took
the
appeal
as
one
member
of
the
board
who
dissented
from
the
decision
not
to
appeal.
all
right.
i
would
like
to
draw
the
court's
attention--
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
yes.
we
had
counsel
employed
to
fight
this
case.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
they
took
the
deposition
of
the
principal
and--
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
no,
but
the
defendants'
lawyer
procured
affidavits
of
both
the
principal
and
the
superintendent,
submitted
papers
and
briefs,
and
argued
the
motion,
the
cross-motion
for
summary
judgment.
so,
yes,
they
did
participate
and
the
defendants
did
participate.
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
joint
appendix.
at
the
bottom
of
page
63,
question:
"what
is
the
policy
of
the
williamsport
school
district
regarding
student
clubs
and
student
meetings
on
public
school
grounds?
"
answer:
"policy
has
been
that
any
group
of
students
that
wishes
a
meeting
within
the
confines
of
the
building
must
meet
with
a
faculty
advisor.
"
the
point
of
this
is
that
the
forum
as
it
existed,
that
williamsport
high
school,
prior
to
the
decision
of
the
district
court
in
this
case,
was
that
these
clubs
had
advisors.
what
is
an
advisor?
i
direct
your
attention
to
page
83
of
the
record.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
joint
appendix,
excuse
me.
question:
"what
sort
of
adult
supervision
does
the
school
district
generally
require
of
student
groups,
you
might
have
answered
that
before,
but
i
don't
remember.
"
answer:
"any
group
of
students
that
meets
within
the
confines
of
the
school
district
meets
with
an
advisor,
a
paid
coach
or
somebody
of
that
nature,
somebody
that
is
on
the
faculty
or
somebody
that
is
being
hired
by
the
williamsport
area
school
district
to
perform
the
function.
"
and,
then
on
down
the
page,
"generally
speaking,
do
adult
supervisors
participate
in
the
student
group
meetings
or
activities?
"
"i
would
say
yes.
"
"if
they
are
an
advisor,
i
would
expect
them
to
be
there
as
somebody
who's
going
to
help
the
students.
"
"are
there
any
student
clubs
for
which
the
faculty
advisor
is
instructed
not
to
participate?
"
answer:
"not
to
my
knowledge".
and,
then
a
question
is
"are
these
advisors
hall
monitors"?
"i
do
not
look
upon
advisors
as
hall
monitors.
"
"i
think
they
are
there
to
help
the
activities.
"
that
was
the
forum
as
it
existed
at
williamsport
high
school
prior
to
the
decision
of
the
district
court
in
this
case.
petros
did
not
meet
until
after
the
district
court...
other
than
informally...
until
after
the
district
court
decided
this
case
and
issued
its
order.
so,
the
district
court
in
this
case
altered
the
forum
as
it
existed.
the
relevance
of
that
is
that
it
is
our
position
that
the
petitioners
must
live
with
the
forum
as
it
existed
and
that
forum
was
to
have
advisors.
why?
because
the
school
board
wants
to
have
structure
and
direction
given
in
the
educational
process
and
that
occurred
in
these
clubs
before
the
district
court's
order
in
this
case
and
it
is
our
contention
that
that
should
occur
and
that
by
the
district
court's
altering
the
forum
it
puts...
in
effect,
gives
the
petitioners
the
right
to
negotiate
as
to
how
the
forum
will
be
and
that
is
not
consonant
with
the
basic
purpose
of
public
education.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
eighty-three,
excuse
me.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
eighty-three,
mr.
chief
justice.
then,
on
page
70,
question:
"if
there
were
a
group
of
students
who
came
to
the
school,
whether
they
were
in
a
club
or
not,
if
they
came
into
the
school,
are
they
required
to
be
under
the
direct
supervision
of
either
a
principal
or
a
faculty
member?
"
answer:
"if
the
students
are
meeting
as
a
club,
such
as
the
key
club,
their
advisor
would
be
required
to
meet
with
them.
"
"if
they
are
not
meeting
as
a
club
group,
or
are
just
in
the
building,
we
have
principals
and
teacher
monitors.
"
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
disagree,
however,
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
misread
the
nature
of
the
forum.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
we
certainly
have
other
grounds,
justice
white.
if
there
is...
it
is
our
position
here
that
there
is
an
establishment
violation,
whether
or
not
there
was
a
public
forum
or
not,
and
that
is
based
on
the
nature
of
the
forum
as
it
existed
at
williamsport
high
school.
we
believe
that
when
an
advisor
is
present
to
help
the
students,
this
objectively
is
sponsoring
and
advancing
religion.
in
addition,
i
would
point
out
on
page
76
of
the
record
with
respect
to
this
advisor
the
answer
of
mr.
newton,
the
principal,
to
mr.
seevers'
question.
"do
you
make,
you
and
the
other
principals
or
supervisors,
actively
check,
attend,
periodically,
student
groups
to
make
sure
that
the
speech
which
is
going
on
is
what
you
consider
proper?
"
answer:
"i
would
say
that
the
very
rule
that
we
have
with
regard
to
any
group
must
meet
with
a
faculty
advisor
gives
us
direct
input
as
to
what
is
going
on.
"
and,
then,
there
is
a
stipulation
in
this
case,
found
on
page
144
of
the
appendix
with
respect
to
this
advisor
situation.
there
is...
reading
in
the
middle
of
paragraph
one,
faculty
advisors:
"there
is,
however,
an
unwritten
policy
of
the
williamsport
area
high
school
that
each
student
club
have
an
adult
advisor
who
is
generally
a
faculty
member
or
another
employee
of
the
school
district.
"
"in
some
circumstances,
parents
of
student
club
members
serve
as
adult
advisors.
"
and,
then
in
the
next
paragraph:
"selection
is
based
upon
the
nature
of
the
particular
club
and
corresponding
background
of
the
faculty
member.
"
"although
students
may
request
a
particular
adult
advisor,
the
principal
and
his
staff
have
final
approval
as
to
whom
will
serve
as
an
advisor
to
a
student
club.
"
then,
i
would
like
to
point
out
on
page
65
of
the
appendix
that
the
nature
of
the
forum
as
it
existed
in
the
question:
"are
there
any
political
clubs
such
as
the
young
democrats
or
young
republicans,
something
of
that
nature.
"
"no".
and,--
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
--and
do.
that
is
correct,
chief
justice.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
well,
there
was
no
republican
club.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
if--
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
--they
could
have
had
one,
but
that
was
not
the
nature
of
the
forum
as
it
existed
at
williamsport
high
school.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
i
am
not
sure.
i
just
don't
know
what
would
have
happened
in
that
case.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
there
is
nothing
except
that
the
clubs
that
were
in
this
forum
were
uncontroversial
and
i
believe
that
the
school
board
would
not
have
opened
this
forum
generally
to
first
amendment
speech
on
the
ground
that
they
would
not
have
wanted
to
promote
controversy
and
divisiveness.
the
purpose
of
the
forum
was
to
examine...
first
of
all,
to
expand
on
directly
curricular
activities.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
if
there
were
a
non-public
forum,
i
believe,
yes.
that
is
my
position.
and,
i
think
they
could
prohibit
that
absent
a
public
forum.
if
there
was
a
public
forum,
then,
no.
the
answer
to
that
is
no.
i
would
also
like
to
call
the
attention
of
the
court
to
the
joint
appendix
at
page
104,
the
second
paragraph,
which
is
an
affidavit
of
wayne
e.
newton,
the
principal
of
the
school,
the
last
paragraph
prior
to
iii.
"any
student
activity
or
club
which
is
considered
to
contribute
to
the
intellectual,
physical
or
social
development
of
the
students
and
is
otherwise
considered
legal
and
constitutionally
proper
would
likely
be
approved
as
an
officially
sponsored
and
sanctioned
school
activity.
"
that
was
also
the
nature
of
the
clubs.
they
were
approved,
they
were
sponsored,
and
that
is
the
nature
of
the
public
school.
there
is
structure,
there
is
direction,
and
people
understand
that
what
goes
on
there
is
approved
and
sponsored
by
the
district.
that
is
the
nature.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
my
reaction
is
that
that
would
be
permitted.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
but,
it
would
be...
the
point
is
it
would
have
an
advisor
there
and
would
be
subject
to
structure
and
direction
from
the
school
district.
we,
as
a
school
board,
were
not
going
to
give
up
our
right
to
give
structure
and
direction
to
the
education
that
was
going
on
in
the
public
school.
if
that
had
happened,
believe
me,
the
parents
would
have
been
in
on
us
the
next
day
complaining
loudly
and
bitterly
about
having
a
situation
where
there
was
no
direction
being
applied
at
the
school.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
petros.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
the
problem
isn't
the
public,
justice
white.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
it
is
the
students
themselves.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
if
this
was
the
anti-taxation
club
and
it
had
an
advisor--
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
--that
activity
would
be
viewed
by
the
students
at
the
high
school
as
being
approved
by
the--
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
well,
it
is
silly
until
you
consider
the
nature
of
public
high
schools.
we
educate
kids
that
run
the
gambit
from
educable
mentally
retarded
to
gifted
and
the
perceptions
of
those
kinds
of
children,
especially
at
the
lower
end
of
the
intellectual
scale,
are
very
much
more
subject
to
impressionability
than...
it
seems
ridiculous
to
think
that
that
would
happen,
but
with
that
kind
of
child--
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
--no,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
some
accommodation
has
to
be
given
to
that
situation,
just
as
i
don't
think
you
should
gear
the
standard
to
the
highest
level,
because
you
span
the
gambit.
that
is
a
distinction
from
the
university
situation
where
people
are
there,
first
of
all,
who
aren't
compelled
to
be
there,
and,
secondly,
who
have
some
intellectual
ability
to
begin
with
and
are
admitted
on
that
basis.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
there--
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
--you
have
opposites
in
the
forum
and
there
it
is
more
difficult,
i
grant.
but,
some
students
would
think
that
the
school
was
endorsing
one
and
some
the
other,
unless
they
also
understood
that
both
groups
were
there
and
understood
the
purpose
of
both
groups.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
well,
you
would
apply
an
objective
test,
that
is
true.
that
is
one
of
the
tests
you
would
apply,
but
you
would
also
apply
the
subjective
test,
which
is
what
would
the
students,
as
they
exist
at
the
high
school,
reasonably
perceive
from
the
activity
that
was
going
on
and
there--
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
--but,
i
don't
think
you
can
entirely
discount
the
fact
that
you
do
have
the
low
end
of
the
spectrum
in
this
particular
situation.
and,
that
is
the
nature
of
public
education.
it
educates
everyone.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
no.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
that
is
right.
and,
i
think
that
that
is
something
that
i
think
this
court
has
to
determine
whether
it
should
take
judicial
notice
of.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
even
though
the
record
doesn't
have
expert
testimony
in
this
regard.
i
will
say
this,
that
the
record
in
the
equal
access
act
is
in
some
ways
equally
deficient.
that
is
i
am
not
sure
that
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
can
be
quantified
that
way.
it
is
a
matter
of
if
you
brought
up
students
or
brought
up
kids
between
the
ages
of
14
and
18,
you
know
they
are
impressionable.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
that
is
true.
and,
i
would
suggest
that
one
of
the
reasons
for
that
is
that
this
matter
was
in
litigation
and
that
you
did
not
have
another
religious
club
or
a
group
of
religious
clubs
as
i
feel
you
would
have
to
have
which
will
inevitably
result
if
this...
if
the
decision
of
the
circuit
court
is
reversed.
that
is
my
reasoning,
justice
stevens,
for
that--
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
--the
record
says
that
the
club
did
not
exceed
45
members.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
no,
the
record
doesn't
show
how
many
met.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,

you
don't
know
that
from
the
record.
i
suspect
it
was
between
twenty
and
forty-five,
a
relatively
small
number.
but,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
this
matter
was
in
litigation
and
i
think
that
there
was
an
inhibiting
effect
of
that
and
that
is
why
you
haven't
had
the
others
come
in
and
ask
for
access
which
i
fully
expect
to
happen
if
this
case
is
reversed.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
no.
i
think
widmar
is
distinguished
also
by
the
very
nature
of
public
schools
as
opposed
to
the
university.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
without
regard
to
the
age,
that
is
right.
we
span
the
gambit,
as
i
have
said.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
in
intellect
from
educably
mentally
retarded
to
gifted.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
well,
it
has
to
do
with
age,
but
it
also
has
to
do
with
maturity
regardless
of
age
too,
and
that
is
the
point.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
no,
it
also
turns--
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
--yes,
but
i
don't
believe
that
that
should
be
the
test.
i
think
it
should
turn
on
the
nature
of
the
public
school
as
opposed
to
the
university.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
as
i
understand
it,
the
taxpayers
did
finance
the
university.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct,
but
the
university
situation
is
different
from
the
secondary
and
elementary
education
provided
in
the
compulsory
attendance
setting
and
there
is
just
no
way
to
avoid
that.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
district
and
circuit
court's
decision
with
respect
to
the
open
forum
question
would
mean
that
any
first
amendment
club
has
a
right
to
be
in
that
forum.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
that
is
right.
you
would
leave
no
discretion
to
the
school
board
in
the
running
of
the
educational
process
in
that
particular
forum.
mr.
john
c.
youngman,
jr.
thank
you.
