justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
might
have
been
a
valid
decision
at
the
time
the
district
court
rendered
it,
but
i
think
our
practice,
since
the
time
of
the
munsingwear
case,
you
know,
some
years
ago,
has
been
to
say
if
it
becomes
moot
on
appeal,
the
whole
thing
washes
out.
in
other
words,
you
would
simply
go
back
and
there
would
be
no
district
court
decision,
you
would
have
no
court
of
appeals
decision.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
you
wouldn't
have
any
doubt
about
how
it
would
come
out
in
the
third
circuit,
would
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
youngman,
why
are
you
reading
us
these
excerpts?
is
it
to
show
that
the
district
court
misconceived
the
factual
setting?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
court
of
appeals
disagree
with
any
of
the
district
court's
factual--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
then,
you
are
asking
us
to
upset
a
finding
made
by
the
district
court
and
not
upset
by
the
court
of
appeals?
