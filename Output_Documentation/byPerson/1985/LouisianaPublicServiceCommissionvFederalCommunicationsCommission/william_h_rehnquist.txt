mr.
malone,
what
kind
of
physical
plant
or
equipment
are
we
talking
about?
is
it
telephone
instruments?
justice
rehnquist
and
jointly
used
plant
means
plant
whether
it
is
telephones
or
lines
or
both
that
are
used
for
both
intrastate
and
interstate?
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
malone,
one
section
you
rely
rather
heavily
on,
i
guess,
is
152(b),
and
that
talks
about
prohibiting
commission
jurisdiction
over
charges,
classifications,
at
cetera,
in
connection
with
interstate
communications
service.
now,
when
you
have
got
a
telephone
pole
out
there
that
has
wires
on
it
that
are
used
both
for
intrastate
and
interstate,
do
you
say
that
that
section
means
that
you
allocate
a
part
of
that
pole
to
intrastate
service?
justice
rehnquist
are
either
one
of
them
on
dry
land,
i
presume?
justice
rehnquist
did
the
commission
then
allow
the
states
or
did
it
follow
the
states'
methods
when
it
came
to
depreciating
for
interstate
communications
service?
justice
rehnquist
so
the
allocation
is
between
a
percentage
of
value
of
a
single
physical
entity.
justice
rehnquist
there
are
four
million
people
in
maryland.
you
figure
$4
a
year,
you
are
talking
about
$16
million
in
maryland
on
your
figures.
justice
rehnquist
well,
there--
0
[generallaughter.]
there
seems
to
be
some
difference
between
the
effect
in
new
york
and
the
effect
in
maryland
if
you
are
both
right.
maybe
it
is
the
mason-dixon
line.
justice
rehnquist
the
what,
the
preemption
calculation?
justice
rehnquist
ninety-seven
percent
of
intrastate
and
three--
justice
rehnquist
--percent
in
interstate?
justice
rehnquist
but
even
with
respect
to
the
accountants--
--you
don't
think
the
accountants
disagree
about
these
things?
we
are
saying
the
same
thing.
justice
rehnquist
i
think
justice
stevens
and
i
both
wanted
to
ask
you,
don't
respected
accountants
disagree
about
how
depreciation
should
be
handled?
justice
rehnquist
well,
the
question
isn't
so
much
whether
the
determination
here
was
a
reasonable
one,
but
whether
the
concept
or
element
of
depreciation
is
so
dramatically
different
from
the
other
elements
of
rate
as
you
have
made
them
out
to
be,
that
those
are
kind
of
political
judgment
questions,
and
this
is
just
purely
a
question
of
historical
fact.
i
don't
think
it
is
quite
that
simple.
justice
rehnquist
--mr.
boudin,
why
did
the
court
of
appeals
shy
away
from
reliance
on
this
section?
justice
rehnquist
then
when
you
refer
to
the
telephone
industry,
it
isn't
the
entire
industry.
