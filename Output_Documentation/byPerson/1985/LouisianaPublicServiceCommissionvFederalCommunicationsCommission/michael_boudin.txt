mr.
michael
boudin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
position
of
the
telephone
industry
in
this
case
is
that
the
fcc's
preemption
order
is
correct
and
should
be
sustained.
i
want
to
make
clear
at
the
outset
what
the
facilities
are,
what
the
fcc
has
and
is
doing,
and
what
the
states
are
asking
to
do
in
this
case.
the
facilities
in
question
are
telephone
poles,
lines,
and
switching
systems
along
with
the
buildings
that
house
them
that
are
used
jointly
in
interstate
and
intrastate
communication.
the
fcc,
as
it
has
for
many
years,
is
determining
the
percentages,
the
useful
lives,
the
depreciation
formulas
so
that
in
the
end
you
say
of
a
telephone
pole,
this
pole
will
last
five
years,
it
must
be
depreciated
at
20
percent
a
year.
and
what
the
states
are
saying
is
that
they
are
entitled
with
respect
to
this
same
telephone
pole
to
say,
no,
it
is
going
to
last
ten
years,
depreciated
at
10
percent
a
year.
it
is
exactly
the
case
of
two
hands
on
the
steering
wheel.
the
chief
justice
was
absolutely
right.
and
this
is
not
a
remarkable
reversal
of
past
practice.
the
fcc
has
had
rules
relating
to
depreciation
since
its
foundation.
it
has
been
prescribing
depreciation
for
about
95
percent
of
the
telephone
plant
in
the
united
states
since
the
late
forties
and
early
fifties,
and
the
states
have
in
fact
with
very
rare
and
unimportant
exceptions
followed
those
depreciation
rates
in
intrastate
proceedings
because
you
are
talking
about
depreciation
of
exactly
the
same
facility.
you
cannot
in
fact
have
accurate
depreciation
for
the
telephone
pole,
mathematically
cannot
do
it
except
by
one
in
a
billion
chance.
you
have
two
different
regimes
of
depreciation,
two
different
formulas
for
the
same
physical
facilities.
gte
actually
put
in
a
mathematical
illustration
demonstrating
it
which
is
in
the
joint
appendix,
but
the
practical
consequences
are
what
are
of
importance
to
us.
mr.
michael
boudin
the
valuation
is
a
red
herring.
there
has
been
no
dispute
about
valuation.
its
original
cost
is
what
is
used
since
hope
natural
gas.
that
213(h),
which
was
not
addressed--
mr.
michael
boudin
--original
cost
less
depreciation
is
the
rate
base,
but
the
valuation
is
the
original
cost
less
the
accumulated
depreciation.
mr.
michael
boudin
no,
because
you
have
to
make
a
large
number
of
different
determinations
with
respect
to
rate
base,
some
of
which
are
historical,
some
of
which
are
legal
or
public
policy.
it
does
not.
this
is
solely
the
determination
as
to
the
length
of
time
and
the
spreading
out
of
that
cost,
whatever
it
may
be.
mr.
michael
boudin
it
will
virtually
always...
in
fact
there
is
very
little
disagreement.
mr.
michael
boudin
you
mean
if
the
states
try
to
set
a
different
value?
mr.
michael
boudin
they
cannot
use
an
old-fashioned
method
of
depreciation.
they
may
or
may
not
be
able
to
use
a
different
method
of
valuation.
mr.
michael
boudin
yes.
mr.
michael
boudin
it
would
be
a
significantly
more
difficult
case,
because
it
would
take
you
back
to
the
distinction
between
valuation
and
depreciation.
the
fcc
has
clear
statutory
authority
with
respect
to
depreciation.
on
valuation,
you
can
make
a
great
deal
of
argument.
i
want
to--
mr.
michael
boudin
--well,
that
would
be...
that
is
another
case,
and
it
is
a
harder
case
for
the
telephone
company
and
the
commission.
let
me
make
that
clear
by
turning
back
to
the
argument
on
the
legal
issue
in
the
case,
and
on
the
statutory
language
that
congress
enacted,
because
we
think
section
220
is
the
key
to
this
case.
it
solves
this
case
without
deciding
more
difficult
cases
later
on,
and
the
result
in
this
case
is
very
clear.
congress
in
section
220
of
the
act
told
the
commission
that
on
this
issue,
depreciation
and
accounting,
the
fcc
shall
determine
the
depreciation
for
subject
carriers.
the
subject
carriers
shall
not
use
any
other
method
of
depreciation,
and
the
fcc
shall
consider
the
views
and
recommendations
of
the
state,
views
and
recommendations,
but
not
the
binding
veto.
that
statutory
language
was
taken
from
section
20(5)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
because
the
interstate
commerce
commission
had
the
same
power.
mr.
michael
boudin
because
the
other
ground,
agency
preemption,
was
so
clearly
established
in
the
fourth
circuit
by
the
two
north
carolina
cases
that
there
was
nothing
new
to
decide
as
long
as
they
didn't
bother
with
the
new
statute.
it
is
nevertheless
the
clearest
ground
for
affirmance
and
it
is
the
narrowest
ground,
and
that
is
why
i
am
arguing
it.
that
statutory
language,
section
220(b),
was
taken
virtually
verbatim
from
section
220(5)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
enacted
in
1920.
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
interpreted
that
language
in
118
icc
in
1926,
its
major
decision
on
depreciation,
as
establishing
that
icc
depreciation
rates
would
preempt
when
the
icc
adopted
them.
that
information
was
no
secret
to
congress
when
it
came
to
frame
the
communications
act
because
the
states
bitterly
complained
of
it.
nevertheless,
congress
reenacted
that
identical
language
which
the
icc
had
interpreted
as
being
automatically
preemptive
if
and
when
the
depreciation
rates
were
determined.
third,
congress
refused
a
specific
state
request
to
enact
a
reservation
which
would
have
specifically
entitled
the
states
to
prescribe
their
own
depreciation
rates
for
intrastate
ratemaking
purposes.
congress
considered
the
proposal.
it
listened
to
a
lot
of
testimony
on
it,
including
explanations
that
it
would
be
a
deviation
from
the
existing
law,
and
the
sponsors
of
that
amendment,
the
house
report,
congressman
rayburn,
said
that
it
would
be
a
change
in
the
existing
law
if
that
reservation
were
adopted,
and
congress
refused
to
adopt
it.
the
pacific
gas
and
electric
case
was
mentioned
earlier.
justice
white
at
page
220
of
that
case
pointed
out
that
it
is
an
improper
construction
of
a
federal
statute
to
read
it
as
embodying
a
statement
which
congress
considered
and
specifically
refused
to
enact,
and
that
is
exactly
what
the
states
are
requesting
here.
they
are
asking
you
to
read
section
220
as
if
congress
passed
a
provision
about
which
it
considered
specifically
and
refused
to
enact
it.
mr.
michael
boudin
well,
the
agency
is
entitled
under
220
to
cede
the
authority
to
the
state
if
it
wishes
to,
so
it
could
do
something
else,
but
only
after
an--
mr.
michael
boudin
--the
section
provides,
220(h),
that
it
can
cede
its
220
powers
to
the
states
if
it
wishes
to.
mr.
michael
boudin
it
prescribed
the
depreciation
itself,
but
it
did
so
after
consultation,
the
three-way
meeting
with
the
states.
all
that
the
fcc
is
doing
here
is
insisting
on
the
continuation
of
a
practice
that
has
been
going
on
for
30
years.
now
that
the
states
have
decided
on
this
particular
method
of
calculating
depreciation,
they
no
longer
want
to
follow
the
fcc's
lead.
and
i
say
again,
to
close,
this
is
a
two
hands
on
the
steering
wheel
case
on
this
single
issue.
it
involves
only
depreciation.
there
are
good
economic
arguments
for
having
separate
rates
of
return.
there
is
much
less
statutory
authority,
certainly
no
legislative
history
suggesting
that
the
fcc
could
regulate
it,
and
it
is
simply
an
issue
that
does
not
get
reached
if
the
court
agrees
that
section
220
resolves
this
case.
and
i
might
add
that
section
220
also
solves
the
section
2(b)(1)
argument
without
having
to
parse
2(b)(1)
for
25
other
situations,
because
i
ask
the
court
to
consider
this.
if
congress
did,
as
we
think
the
legislative
history
clearly
shows,
decide
in
1934
that
it
should
continue
to
allow
the
federal
agency
to
determine
this
common
issue
of
depreciation,
then
the
one
thing
you
know
is
that
some
general
language
elsewhere
in
the
statute
can't
be
read
to
contradict
that
specific
legislative
intent.
most
preemption
cases
are
quite
difficult.
they
involve
guesses
as
to
what
congress
would
have
done
if
it
had
thought
about
the
issue.
they
involve
occupation
of
the
field
conjectures,
possibilities
of
frustration.
this
is
not
such
a
case.
this
is
a
case
where
we
know
that
congress
thought
about
this
precise
issue,
and
on
depreciation,
as
on
one
or
two
other
issues
in
the
act,
it
decided
in
favor
of
federal
authority.
mr.
michael
boudin
the
answer
to
that
is
twofold.
first,
that
if
you
accept
the
reading
of
220,
you
do
not
even
reach
the
question
of
how
2(b)
might
be
parsed
in
general,
because
this
issue
has
been
resolved,
but
the
second
answer
is,
if
you
turn
to
the
language--
mr.
michael
boudin
--no,
it
is
circular.
it
can
go
around
either
way.
if
you
assume
that
congress
had
a
specific
intent
on
the
subject
of
depreciation
and
resolved
that
in
a
particular
way,
then
the
specific
resolution
of
that
issue
prevails
over
any
general
language.
mr.
michael
boudin
exactly,
and
also
involves
the
preemptive--
mr.
michael
boudin
--the
term
2(b)(1)
in
our
contention
is
a
reference
to
rates
charged
to
customers.
there
is
linguistic
evidence
to
that
effect
in
the
act.
mr.
justice
white,
just
to
underscore
that
point,
because
i
don't
want
to
trespass
further
on
the
court's
time,
we
know
what
congress
was
worried
about
when
it
enacted
section
2(b)
because
the
legislative
history
addresses
that,
to.
it
was
not
concerned
with
depreciation
charges.
it
was
concerned
with
the
shrevport
doctrine
and
rates
charged
to
customers.
i
thank
the
court.
