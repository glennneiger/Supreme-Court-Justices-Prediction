mr.
charles
fried
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
should
first
begin
by
making
a
remark
about
the
effect
on
rates.
in
the
maryland
case,
which
is
the
case
which
you
will
be
considering
immediately
after
this,
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
at
page
8
of
the
cert
petition...
page
8a
of
the
appendix
to
the
cert
petition
estimated
that
the
effect
on
rates
was
on
the
average
a
penny
a
day
per
customer,
and
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
maryland
is
unusual
in
this
respect.
our
affirmative
argument
is
straightforward,
so
i
would
like
to
just
set
the
predicate
for
it,
and
then
move
on
to
some
of
the
concerns
that
have
been
raised
by
petitioners
and
others.
the
basis
for
federal
intervention
here
is,
i
think,
rather
palpable.
we
are
talking
about
maintaining--
mr.
charles
fried
--i
don't
know
quite
how
to
deal
with
that
overall
figure.
it
is
an
estimate.
i
don't
know
of
any
finding
to
that
effect,
and
when
we
are
talking
about
telephone
rates
nationwide,
i
am
not
able
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
to
decide
whether
a
billion
dollars
is
a
lot
or
a
little,
but
i
don't
want
to
concede--
mr.
charles
fried
--i
don't
want
to
concede
that
billion
dollars.
i
thought
the
penny...
a
penny
a
day
was
a--
mr.
charles
fried
--i
can't
tell
you
that.
mr.
charles
fried
and
perhaps
that
way
we
can
begin
to
approach
mr.
malone's
figure,
and
we
are
both
right.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
perhaps
my
brother,
mr.
boudin,
can
assist
on
some
of
these
matters,
but
i
do
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
findings
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
maryland
case,
because
there
there
is
a
specific
finding
which
brings
the
matter
down
to
the
effect
on
consumers.
now,
we
are
talking
about
the
physical
integrity
and
the
modernity
and
the
financial
soundness
of
the
very
channels
of
interstate
communication,
and
what
depreciation
is
about
is
paying
for
physical
equipment
as
it
wears
out,
technologically
or
physically.
and
all
that
the
preemption
order
sought
to
do
is
to
make
sure
that
the
preemption
calculations
were
made
in
as
accurate
a
fashion
as
possible,
and
that
is
very
important.
mr.
charles
fried
i
am
sorry,
the
depreciation
calculations,
justice
white,
that
the
depreciation
calculations
were
made
in
is
accurate
a
way
as
possible,
that
they
reflected
as
accurately
as
possible
what
in
fact
was
happening
to
those
assets
out
there
in
the
world.
now,
all
of
these
assets
are
used
both
in
inter
and
intrastate
communications
because,
as
justice
burger
said
when
he
was
on
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals,
in
terms
of
facilities,
we
have
one
integrated
system,
and
when
the
switch
fails
in
a
local
exchange
or
a
telephone
pole
which
is
rotted
blows
down,
the
effect
is
as
much
on
interstate
as
it
is
on
intrastate
communication.
now,
the
basis
for
what
the
fcc
did
here
is,
as
mr.
malone
pointed
out,
first
of
all
in
section
1
of
the
act,
section
151,
in
which
the
fcc
has
an
overriding
mandate
to
make
available
to
all
the
people
of
the
united
states
rapid,
efficient
nationwide
facilities
at
reasonable
charges,
and
section
220(b),
which
says
that
the
commission
shall
prescribe
depreciation
charges.
those
are
the
two
statutory
bases.
now,
let
me
address
some
of
the
concerns
that
have
been
raised
apart
from
the
concerns
about
rate
increases.
first,
there
is
a
very
real
concern
about
federalism.
it
is
an
important
concern.
it
is
one
that
we
share.
but
here,
unlike
some
other
cases
the
court
has
had
to
consider,
there
is
no
setting
of
the
state's
regulatory
agenda,
no
mandating
of
state
procedures,
as
one
justice
has
put
it,
no
kidnapping
of
the
state
procedures
at
all,
just
the
familiar
instance
of
federal
law
supplying
one
of
the
determinants
in
an
element
in
a
calculation
which
otherwise
goes
forward
wholly
according
to
state
procedures
and
concerns.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
in
this
case,
though
the
court
of
appeals
spoke
in
terms
of
section
1,
the
commission
was
very
assiduous
to
rely
on
section
220(b),
which
specifically
spoke
about
depreciation.
so,
if
there
is
a
slippery
slope
here,
the
fcc
has
not
sought
to
put
its
foot
on
it.
it
has
rested
firmly
on
section
220(b).
now,
section
152(b)
is...
2(b)(1)
is
the
one
which
causes
most
difficulties
for
the
petitioners.
and
here
i
must
say
we
read
the
legislative
history
rather
differently
from
petitioners
because
what
we
see
happening,
happened
back
there
in
1934
was
that
the
state
commissioners
were
alarmed
about
federal
intervention
in
depreciation,
and
sought
from
the
house
a
provision,
220(j),
sought
a
220(j)
which
would
block
any
federal
effect
on
intrastate
depreciation
rates,
and
they
failed
to
get
that
provision.
what
they
got
seems
to
me
to
look
like
a
typical
face-saving
compromise
which
gave
them
some
sort
of
compromise
language,
but
not
at
all
the
substance
of
what
they
were
seeking.
now,
the
language
also
of
152(b)
does
not
do
what
petitioners
claim.
the
petitioners
read
152(b)
as
if
it
said,
if
you
have
a
facility
which
exists
in
both
interstate
and
intrastate
communication,
then
the
fact
that
it
exists
in
intrastate
communication
precludes
federal
jurisdiction
over
it.
that
reading
is
a
reading
which
has
been
consistently
urged
upon
the
commission
and
consistently
rejected.
it
was
first
urged
and
first
rejected
back
in
1947,
when
the
commission
began
its
long
trek
towards
the
situation
which
now
obtains
where
you
can
buy
your
telephone
rather
than
having
to
rent
it
from
the
phone
company.
and
what
the
commission
did
to
bring
about
that
result,
and
of
course
it
doesn't
obtain
just
in
respect
to
the
telephone
you
have
in
your
home,
but
it
relates
to
private
exchange
systems,
to
all
kinds
of
complicated
computer
equipment
and
the
like.
what
the
commission
did
was
to
mandate
that
the
state
commissions
remove
from
their
tariffs
any
requirement
that
customers
pay
for
and
lease
their
phones
from
the
phone
company.
now,
that
telephone,
which
you
now
can
buy
because
of
the
fcc
orders,
that
telephone
is
used
97
percent,
it
is
estimated,
in
intrastate
communication,
yet
the
remaining
3
percent
is
crucial
to
interstate
and
was
found
to
be
sufficient
for
a
federal
regime
about
customer
terminal
equipment.
mr.
charles
fried
most...
yes--
mr.
charles
fried
--yes,
justice
rehnquist.
most...
the
telephone
you
use
in
your
home
probably
is
used
97
percent
intrastate,
and
the
regime
which
now
obtains
is
a
regime
that
was
imposed
by
the
fcc
against
exactly
the
same
2(b)(1)
argument
that
you
are
hearing
today.
the
regime
which
has
been
imposed
on
the
transmission
of--
mr.
charles
fried
--no,
it
was--
mr.
charles
fried
--as
we
read,
as
we
read--
mr.
charles
fried
--i
think
that
would
be
a
long
stretch,
and
a
very
serious
move
which
i
would
not--
mr.
charles
fried
--which
i
would...
i
myself
would
be
very
hesitant
to
embrace,
because
if
you
see
what
remains,
justice
stevens,
and
i
think
the
question
really
points
out
what
this
case
is
about,
because
if
you
see
what
remains
of
the
states'
capacity
here,
what
they
are
left
with
is
that
part
which
is
peculiarly
appropriate
to
state
concern,
the
rate
design
questions.
for
instance,
will
businesses
subsidize
residences?
will
large
users
subsidize
small
users?
are
we
going
to
have
lifeline
rates?
are
we
going
to
have
special
rates
for
low
income
users?
all
of
these
things
are
exactly
the
kinds
of
things
which
are--
mr.
charles
fried
--i
think
that
depreciation
with
respect
is
not
one
of
those
things.
depreciation--
mr.
charles
fried
--i
think
that
that
is
a
rather--
mr.
charles
fried
--i
don't
think
that
can
be
affirmed
wholeheartedly,
justice
stevens,
because
in
fact
what
has
been
happening
for
the
last
50
years
on
depreciation
rates
is
that
they
are
set
in
three-way
meetings
between
the
fcc,
state
commissioners,
and
the
telephone
companies,
and
at
the
end
of
those
three-way
meetings
a
depreciation
rate
is
set
by
the
fcc,
and
by
and
large
it
is
followed.
now,
what
has
not
happened
is
that--
mr.
charles
fried
--it
has
so
far.
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
it
has.
now,
it
has
never
come
to
a
conflict.
those
three-way
meetings
have
by
and
large...
i
can't
say
universally,
but
by
and
large
been
the
basis
for
depreciation
rates
throughout
the
country,
and
those
are
meetings
with
those
three
components
leading
to
the
setting
of
a
rate
by
the
fcc.
there
has
been
one
reported
case
in
which
there
was
resistance
to
that,
and
the
state
court
decision
which
held,
as
mr.
malone
has
argued,
but
beyond
that,
the
universal
practice
has
been
one
of
accommodation,
no
particular
conflict,
under
the
aegis
and
leadership
of
the
fcc.
mr.
charles
fried
the
reason
for
the
change
is
the
reason
which
the
commission
gave,
which
is
that
in
the
new
technological
and
competitive
environment,
the
inaccurate
depreciation
formulas,
the
whole
life
formulas
and
the
vintage
group
formulas,
and
that
is
what
we
are
talking
about,
that
is
all
we
are
talking
about
here,
and
essentially
those
are
formulas
which
have
to
do...
at
least
the
whole
life
formulas
have
to
do
with
how
you
adjust
to
misestimates.
mr.
charles
fried
i
think
that
what
happened--
mr.
charles
fried
--what
happened
was,
in
the
first...
the
first
depreciation
order,
the
one
which...
where
the
commission
has
departed
from
that,
they
assume
that
the
states
would
go
along,
and
there
had
been
this
kind
of
collaboration.
what
happened,
and
this
is
set
out
in
footnote
14
of
paragraph
37
of
the
fcc's
order,
to
their
surprise,
for
the
first
time
14
states
refused
to
follow
them
on
one
element
of
the
depreciation
order,
and
nine
on
another.
so,
for
the
first
time,
the
fcc
was
faced
with
a
real
confrontation,
a
confrontation
which
had
not
existed
until
this
time.
now,
if
i
may
go
back,
justice
stevens,
to
your
question,
because
i
think
it
is
an
important
one,
there
is
a
big
difference
between
depreciation
on
one
hand
and
these
rate
design
questions
on
the
other.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
rate
of
return
seems
to
us
to
be
different
from
depreciation.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
it
may
be
more
local.
of
course,
it
is
subject
to
federal
constitutional
limitations,
which...
these
other
elements
are
not,
at
least
not
directly,
but
the
other
aspect
of
depreciation
is
depreciation
is
a
fact
in
the
world.
it
is
not
really
a...
it
is
not
really
a
normative
judgment
at
all.
when
you
decide
whether
you
are
going
to
have
businesses
subsidizing
residences,
that
is
a
political
judgment
and
one
which
we
can
understand
the
state
commissioners
would
like
to
reserve
for
themselves,
but
how
quickly
something
depreciates,
and
what
you
do
about
misestimates
of
depreciation,
which
is
what
remaining
life
versus
whole
life
is
all
about
that
is
about
facts
in
the
world.
mr.
charles
fried
i
am
sorry,
justice--
mr.
charles
fried
--well,
indeed
they
do,
justice
rehnquist.
but
the
question
is
that
in
the
face
of
such
a
disagreement,
is
the
fcc
out
of
bounds
or
is
it
not
in
fact
exercising
the
authority
given
to
it
in
section
220
to
resolve
that
question
and
to
resolve
that
question
on
a
record
which
shows
that
the
previous
rule
had
resulted
in
something
like
$20
billion
of
unrecovered
phantom
assets
as
the
result
of
too
slow
depreciation
and
an
unwillingness
or
an
inability
under
the
old
whole
life
formulas
to
recapture
when
you
have
made
an
initial
mistake?
so
it
was
a
response,
to
be
sure.
accountants
will
differ.
they
are
probably
like
lawyers.
they
will
differ
about
almost
anything.
but
the
question
is
whether
the
determination
here
was
a
reasonable
one--
mr.
charles
fried
--i
perhaps
am
oversimplifying
somewhat,
but
i
think
depreciation
is
in
the
end...
accountants
would
agree
to
this,
that
depreciation
in
the
end
is
an
attempt
to
reflect
year
by
year
a
fact
about
the
world.
and
they
may
differ
about
the
best
way
to
do
that.
when
you
are
designing
rates,
nobody
disagrees
that
that
is
a
political
judgment
about
who
ought
to
be
paying
what
and
who
ought
to
be
subsidizing
who.
so,
it
is
in
that
respect
that
i
think
the
two
are
rather
different.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
in
respect
to
rate
base--
mr.
charles
fried
--rate
base
is
a
matter
of
valuation,
and
there...
at
least
it
starts
out
with
the
initial
valuation
of
the
asset,
and
there
i
believe
213
does
speak
directly
to
that;
and
as
i
understand
it,
the
commission
here
has
not
sought
in
any
way
to
intervene
on
the
subject
of
the
initial
valuation
of
these
assets.
it
has
made
no
attempt
to
say
anything
on
that
subject.
i
think
one
of
the
positions
which
needs
to
be...
which
is
a
matter
of
concern
is
the
question
of
the
fcc's
having
changed
its
position,
and
one
is
used
to
regulatory
commissions
sometimes
turning
on
a
dime.
that
is
not
an
unfamiliar
process.
but
here
i
think
that
turnaround
should
not
he
exaggerated,
because
in
fact
the
way
was
prepared
because
of
the
assumption,
because
of
the
assumption
that
the
states
would
go
along
with
what
the
fcc
had
determined,
and
the
subsequent
experience
which
is
raised
for
you
by
the
ohio
case
which
you
are
holding,
i
suppose,
for
the
result
in
this
case,
as
shown
in
the
ohio
case
and
in
many
other
cases
where
for
the
first
time
there
was
confrontation.
now,
i
think
that
judge
tuttle
in
the
fourth
circuit
explained
very
well
why
there
is
this
confrontation.
there
is
in
depreciation...
i
thank
the
court.
