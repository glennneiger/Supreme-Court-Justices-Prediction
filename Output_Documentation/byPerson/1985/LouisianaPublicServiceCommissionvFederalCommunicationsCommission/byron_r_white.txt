justice
white
i
think
the
thrust
of
your
argument
is
that
there
just
isn't
any
room
under
the
act
for
any
kind
of
an
implied
preemption.
it
is
just
contrary
to
the
express
terms
of
the
act.
justice
white
i
take
it
you
would
be
making
the
same
argument
even
if
you
accepted,
which
i
gather
you
don't,
that
dual
regulation
permitting
the
states
to
set
depreciation
rates
for
interstate,
intrastate
equipment
would
frustrate
the
fcc's
powers.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
because
of
accelerated
depreciation?
justice
white
countrywide?
justice
white
well,
it
was
working
so
well,
what
was
the
reason
for
a
change?
justice
white
so
it
didn't
think
the
three-way
meeting
would
accomplish
what
it
wanted
to
accomplish?
justice
white
and
why
not?
justice
white
so
your
argument,
of
course,
is
that
the
statute
does
the
preempting,
and
it
is
not
a
case
of
agency
preemption.
the
agency
couldn't
do
anything
else
but.
justice
white
why
is
it
entitled
to
do
so?
justice
white
and
did
it
for
a
long
time
or
not?
justice
white
well,
what
about...
what
was
your
response
to...
his
response
to
152(b),
section
152(b),
where
the
commission
is
denied
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
charges
and
so
on
with
respect
to
intrastate
communication?
justice
white
what
if
you...
if
you
read
(b),
you
don't
even
get
to
220.
justice
white
because
220
deals
specifically
with
depreciation?
justice
white
i
thought
charges
included
depreciation.
justice
white
are
we
supposed
to
decide
here
which
one
of
you
is
right
about
the
history,
what
was
the
status
quo
at
the
time?
