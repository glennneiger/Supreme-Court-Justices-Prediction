mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
is
a
consolidated
case.
it
is
here
on
three
petitions
for
writs
of
certiorari
to
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
they
have
been
brought
by
california,
ohio,
and
florida.
and
there
is
a
separate
appeal
which
has
been
instituted
by
the
state
of
louisiana.
the
issue
raised
by
these
cases
is
whether
the
1934
communications
act
empowers
the
fcc
to
preempt
the
state's
regulation
of
depreciation
in
accounting
matters
for
local
telephone
ratemaking
purposes.
from
1934
to
1983,
the
fcc
did
not
attempt
to
preempt.
it
took
the
position
that
the
act
as
written
deserved
a
system
of
dual,
that's
state
and
federal
regulation
over
these
matters.
so
this
dual
regulation
took
hold,
and
a
primitive
telephone
network
eventually
became
the
most
technologically
advanced,
efficient,
and
reliable
system
in
the
world.
then
in
1983
the
commission
took
a
new
position.
it
found
at
the
behest
of
the
utility
industry
that
the
act
as
originally
written
not
only
allowed
but
required
preemption,
and
that
even
if
its
new
reading
of
the
act
was
inaccurate,
it
still
could
preempt
because
a
failure
to
do
so
would
frustrate
the
implementation
of
its
general
responsibility
to
maintain
an
efficient
interstate
telephone
network.
so
it
told
the
states
to
base
local
rates
on
its
perception
of
the
correct
way
to
depreciate
and
to
account
for
the
costs
in
plant
which
are
assigned
to
the
states
under
the
long
accepted
separations
principle.
now,
that
decision,
if
upheld
by
the
courts,
will
require
local
telephone
customers
to
pay
very
substantial
telephone
rate
increases
with
no
assurance
that
a
single
dollar
of
those
added
payments
will
go
to
fulfilling
the
purpose
for
which
the
fcc
preempted.
that
is,
plant
modernization.
on
appeal,
the
lower
court,
the
fourth
circuit,
had
affirmed
by
a
two
to
one
vote,
and
it
has
done
so
based
not
on
agreement
with
the
commission's
new
reading
of
the
communications
act,
but
rather
on
this
implied
preemption
theory,
the
syllogism
that
competition
will
breed
a
need
for
plant
replacement
or
accelerated
depreciation,
and
that
can
be
facilitated
by
preemption.
the
lower
court
should
be
reversed
for
several
reasons.
the
first
is
that
it
ignores
the
will
of
congress.
it
ignores
the
fact
that
congress
back
in
1934
carefully
constructed
a
jurisdictional
boundary
which
divided
the
fcc's
jurisdiction
from
that
of
the
states,
and
in
doing
so
preserved
to
the
states
local
depreciation
and
accounting
regulation.
now,
depreciation
by
definition
is
the
recovery
of
a
capital
asset
over
its
life.
so
in
sitting
down
to
set
up
depreciation
accruals,
a
company
manager
or
a
regulator
asks
him
or
herself
three
questions.
is
this
cost
or
is
this
asset
depreciable?
that
is,
they
classify
the
property.
the
second
question
is,
what
is
it
worth?
what
is
its
value?
that
is
the
valuation
of
the
property.
and
the
third
question
is,
how
long
is
this
going
to
live,
because
i
want
to
allow
the
company
to
recover
this
capital
value
over
its
life,
and
that
is
the
process
that
results
in
the
calculation
of
a
specific
depreciation
percentage.
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
that
is
straight
line
depreciation,
your
honor.
now,
having
developed
this
percentage,
you
then
simply
apply
that
to
the
capital
asset
and
derive
specific
dollar
and
cent
depreciation
charges
to
recover
each
year.
the
fundamental
flaw
with
the
fcc's
position
that
it
is
able
to
preempt
and
able
to
set
local
depreciation
charges
is
that
each
of
these
three
functions,
each
tool
involved
in
this
task
has
been
denied
the
fcc
by
congress.
first,
let's
look
at
valuation.
section
213
of
the
communications
act
empowers
the
fcc
to
value
plant,
but
section
213(h)
expressly
and
unequivocally
provides
that
the
states
retain
the
power
to
value
the
plant
which
is
under
their
jurisdiction.
so,
certainly
if
the
fcc
cannot
dictate
to
the
states
the
value
of
the
plant
which
is
subject
to
intrastate
regulation,
then
they
can't
dictate
the
specific
depreciation
accruals
which
are
designed
to
reimburse
companies
for
the
value
of
that
plant.
in
other
words,
the
fcc
order
assumes
unto
itself
a
power
expressly
denied
it
by
section
213(h).
let's
look
at
the
other
two
functions,
classification
of
the
property
and
the
development
of
these
specific
depreciation
percentages
to
apply
to
the
property's
value.
well,
the
government,
the
fcc
argues
that
section
220(b)
of
the
act,
and
that
is
the
general
depreciation
and
accounting
section,
gives
them
the
authority
not
only
to
set
up
classifications
and
these
specific
depreciation
percentages
for
the
plant
under
their
jurisdiction,
but
it
also
gives
them
the
authority
to
set
up
classifications
and
percentages
for
the
plant
and
the
assets
under
the
state's
jurisdiction
and
authority.
that
is
the
new
reading.
that
is
the
reading
that
they
never
took
from
1934
to
1983,
and
that
the
fourt
circuit
was
not
willing
to
embrace.
but
they
argue
that
section
220(b)
expressly
authorizes
them
to
take
over
these
two
functions,
but
when
one
reads
section
220
in
its
full
context,
with
particular
reference
to
section
220(j),
one
sees
that
congress
did
not
give
them
the
authority
to
classify
plant
or
to
develop
depreciation
percentages
with
respect
to
the
plant
in
the
state's
jurisdiction.
now,
of
course,
this
is--
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
--it
could
be
telephone
poles,
your
honor,
telephone
lines,
all
of
the
plant
which
really
goes
into...
the
vast
majority
of
the
plant
which
goes
into
the
provision
of
telephone
service.
certainly
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
plant
which
is
assigned
solely
to
the
provision
of
intrastate
service,
but
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
the
fcc's
attempt
to
take
over
the
costs
mainly
which
are
devoted
to
jointly
used
plant.
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
that's
correct,
your
honor.
now,
if
one
considers
the
fact
that
in
1934
the
vast
majority
of
this
plant
was
valued
on
a
fair
value
basis,
and
fair
value
is
attune
inextricably
to
the
length
of
lives,
it
really
makes
no
sense
that
congress
would
have
ever
told
the
states
that
you
can
value
the
plant
but
say
to
the
fcc
with
the
states
valuing
it,
you
can
assume
how
long
it
is
going
to
live.
that
is
like
asking
two
people
to
drive
a
car
at
one
time
with
one
person
having
their
foot
on
the
accelerator
and
the
other
person
steering.
it
just
couldn't
possibly
work.
but
the
fcc
here
is
saying
that
it
has
the
power
to
classify
this
property,
and
really
its
position
misreads
section
220(j).
now,
that
was
a
provision,
your
honors,
which
caused
a
great
deal
of
dispute
in
the
enactment
of
the
communications
act.
the
senate
wanted
a
220(j)
which
would
have
assumed
preemptive
powers
with
the
fcc,
and
would
have
called
for
a
study
to
look
into
the
reasonableness
of
undoing
these
powers,
and
the
house
wanted
a
220(j)
which
would
have
expressly
prohibited
preemption.
so,
a
conference
committee
was
called,
and
it
ultimately
gave
both
sides
part
of
the
loaf.
it
gave
the
house
the
continuation
of
the
status
quo,
which
in
1934
was
dual
regulation
with
the
states
regulating
these
depreciation
and
accounting
functions
for
local
matters,
and
it
gave
the
senate
a
direction,
not
a
request,
but
a
direction
to
the
fcc
to
study
this
dual
regulation,
and
to
come
back
and
tell
us
whether
it
works.
if
it
is
causing
problems,
do
a
study...
whether
it
is
causing
problems
or
not,
do
a
study,
and
come
back
to
us,
and
if
it
is
causing
problems
we
will
give
you
new
legislation
to
give
you
preemptive
authority.
but
220(j)
clearly
evidences
congress's
position
that
the
act
as
written
left
the
states
with
this
power
because
it
envisions
a
need
for
new
legislation
to
harmonize
what
it
describes
as
state
and
federal
powers,
not
practices,
but
powers
over
depreciation
in
accounting
matters.
so,
the
three
functions,
the
classification
of
the
property,
its
valuation,
and
the
development
of
specific
depreciation
percentages
to
apply
to
that
value
in
order
to
determine
dollar
and
cents
accruals
are
all
reserved
to
the
states.
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
yes,
your
honor,
but
i
think
congress
has
always
recognized,
your
honor,
that
if
you
have
a
telephone
pole
in
lake
tahoe,
it
is
subject
to
a
very
different
climate
than
a
telephone
pole
in
lake
placid,
and
it
is--
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
--yes,
your
honor.
0
[generallaughter.]
but
one
is
not
going
to
last
as
long
as
the
other.
by
the
same
token,
if
you
have
a
central
office
switch
serving
an
area
such
as
tampa
bay,
which
is
growing,
and
a
central
office
switch
serving
an
area
such
as
green
bay,
they
are
subject
to
very
different
technological
obsolescence,
growth,
very
different
factors
that
go
into
the
development
of
these
service
lives
and
these
depreciation
percentages.
and
congress
back
in
'34
wisely
recognized
that
the
state
regulators
on
the
scene
were
best
able
to
take
measure
of
these
differences
and
to
set
meaningful
depreciation
charges
in
accounting
classifications.
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
well,
for
interstate
communications
services,
the
commission
eventually
grew
into
a
position
where
it
was
able
to
develop
its
own
depreciation
charges
with
respect
to
the
costs
that
were
separated
to
it.
let's
assume
we
have
a
telephone
pole
that
costs
$100,
and
we
assume
that
75
percent
of
that
pole's
usage
is
devoted
to
intrastate
services
and
25
percent
is
devoted
to
interstate.
what
we
do
is,
we
assign
the
states
responsibility
for
dealing
with
the
$75
on
that
pole,
and
the
fcc
is
responsible
for
dealing
with
the
other
$25.
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
that's
right,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
and
with
respect
to
section
152,
your
honor,
that
is
a
jurisdictional
overlay
to
the
act.
it
tell
us
how
to
read
the
other
provisions.
subdivision
(a)
assigns
the
fcc
jurisdiction
of
interstate
matters,
and
subdivision
(b)
tells
the
fcc
and
the
states
what
the
fcc
can't
do.
subdivision
(b),
which
you
referred
to,
your
honor,
prohibits
the
fcc
from
asserting
jurisdiction
over
charges,
classifications,
and
practices
devoted
to
the
provision
of
intrastate
services.
so,
clearly
the
threshold
question
with
respect
to
that
provision
is,
do
these
terms,
charges,
classifications,
and
practices
refer
to
local
or
intrastate
matters?
because
if
they
do,
the
fcc
is
violating
152(b)
as
well
as
213(h)
and
220(j).
now,
charges,
classifications,
and
practices
traditionally
have
been
used
to
refer
to
depreciation
charges
or
classification
and
accounting
classifications
or
practices.
congress
in
fact
in
section
220,
which
is
the
lynchpin
for
the
fcc's
preemption
theory
in
this
case
that
general
depreciation
and
accounting
statutes
uses
the
term
"charges"
seven
times
to
refer
to
depreciation,
and
it
uses
the
term
"classifications"
to
refer
to
accounting.
academicians,
state
regulators,
the
utility
industry,
the
fcc,
and
before
it
the
icc
have
all
consistently
used
these
terms
found
in
section
152(b)
to
refer
to
depreciation
and
accounting.
so,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
that
if
we
read
152(b)
consistently
with
its
general
usage,
that
it
prohibits
preemption
by
preserving
to
the
states
and
to
their
jurisdiction
regulatory
control
over
local
depreciation
charges
and
accounting
classifications.
but
how
does
the
fcc...
how
does
it
answer
these
claims?
how
did
the
fourth
circuit
answer
them?
well,
the
fourth
circuit
did
not
give
a
great
deal
of
attention
to
the
law
because
it
went
on
to
section
151
and
the
implied
preemption
theory.
but
on
appeal,
the
respondents
have
argued
that
section
152(b),
although
by
its
express
design
it
refers
to
all
of
title
2
other
than
the
pole
attachment
statute,
and
therefore
would
refer
to
section
220,
and
although
section
152
uses
the
very
same
terms
as
appear
in
section
220,
they
argue
that
it
has
no
relevance
to
depreciation
accounting.
they
claim
that
the
terms
charges,
classifications,
and
practices
refer
to
rate
structures
or
rates
for
services,
but
their
position
ignores
the
fact
that
that
statute
uses
very
different
language
than
congress
had
intended
to
just
refer
to
rates
for
services.
it
says
that
the
fcc
cannot
assert
jurisdiction
over
charges,
classifications,
and
practices
for
or
in
connection
with
local
rates,
and
it
is
the
in
connection
with
language
which
clearly
encompasses
depreciation
and
accounting.
their
position
also
in
claiming
that
it
has
no
reference
to
220
and
simply
refers
to
rate
structure
attributes
extreme
redundancy
to
congress
by
assuming
that
congress
used
six
terms
to
mean
one.
with
respect
to
section
220(j),
and
that
is
the
provision
again
which
calls
for
a
study
by
the
fcc
to
look
into
the
reasonableness
of
harmonizing
state
and
federal
powers
over
depreciation,
they
argued
that
that
provision
was
nothing
more
than
a
paraphrase
of
the
senate
pro-preemption
220(j).
but
again,
that
statute
belies
their
position,
because
it
calls
for
the
harmonization
of
state
and
federal
powers,
and
clearly
by
calling
for
the
harmonization
of
powers,
it
assumed
that
the
states
did
have
powers
under
the
law
as
written,
a
position
directly
contrary
to
that
which
formed
the
basis
for
the
preemption
order.
with
regard
to
section
213(h),
they
haven't
answered
us,
and
frankly,
we
can't
criticize
them
for
not
doing
so,
because
our
position
on
that
evolves
from
our
analysis
of
allegations
made
by
the
respondents
in
their
briefs
concerning
section
213(h),
gte
in
particular,
so
they
haven't
had
an
opportunity
to
respond
on
that.
but
we
have
here
two
very
different
readings
of
the
communications
act.
we
have
a
reading
by
the
states
which,
of
course,
is
consistent
with
the
reading
that
the
fcc
took
for
its
first
50
years
which
has
all
of
the
pieces
of
the
legislative
puzzle
fitting.
they
are
structurally
coherent.
they
supplement
one
another.
each
word
in
each
statute
has
a
meaning,
and
we
had
the
respondents'
reading,
the
new
reading,
which
has
pieces
in
the
legislative
puzzle
clashing.
they
conflict.
you
have
section
152(b)
referring
clearly
to
other
provisions
of
the
act,
including
section
220,
but
under
their
position
having
no
relevance
to
section
220.
you
have
six
terms
of
art
in
section
152(b),
according
to
their
position,
meaning
only
one
term.
you
have
sections
220(h),
referring
to
waivers,
and
section
220(i),
a
notice
statute,
as
proposed
by
the
states,
directly
at
odds
with
section
220(j)
as
originally
proposed
by
the
states.
in
other
words,
their
new
reading
of
the
act
violates
a
number
of
rules
of
statutory
construction,
but
the
fourth
circuit
was
still
willing
to
preempt,
and
it
did
so
by
reasoning
that
even
though
this
increase
or
this
order
by
the
fcc
is
really
designed
to
increase
local
rates,
that
is
still
justified
because
it
is
going
to
further
general
responsibilities
found
in
section
151
of
the
act.
but
that
sort
of
reasoning,
as
the
lower
court
dissent
indicated,
really
allows
an
agency
to
overreach
with
its
general
purpose
language.
it
invites
an
agency
to
hold
general
purpose
language
such
as
151,
which
really
has
no
legislative
history
to
it,
and
simply
tells
the
fcc,
go
and
regulate
interstate
matters,
to
hold
that
language
up
to
the
light
and
to
manipulate
it
until
it
is
able
to
derive
a
stream
of
unstated
purposes
which
are
really
predesigned
to
conflict
with
the
state
law
to
be
overridden.
and
that
process
is
particularly
bothersome
when
it
overrides
historic,
deeply
routed
police
powers
which
preexisted
with
the
states
at
the
time
that
the
communications
act
was
passed.
we
don't
think
that
this
court
has
ever
endorsed
this
sort
of
stepping
stone
or
bootstrap
preemption.
indeed,
in
the
pacific
gas
and
electric
case,
this
court
indicated
where
congress
has
clearly
evidenced
a
willingness
to
tolerate
dual
regulation,
there
is
no
basis
for
implying
preemptive
authority
in
an
agency
to
preempt
in
order
to
avoid
the
effects
of
the
dual
regulation
which
congress
has
indicated
a
willingness
to
live
with.
what
we
have
in
this
case
is
a
classic
example
of--
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
--exactly,
your
honor.
exactly.
what
we
have
here
is,
we
have
an
act
of
congress
which
clearly
sets
up
dual
regulation,
which
constructs
this
jurisdictional
wall
between
the
states
and
the
federal
government,
and
then
we
have
an
administrative
order
which
simply
circumvents
that
wall,
and
it
is
based
not
on
new
law,
or
it
is
based
not
on
the
study
which
was
called
for
by
congress,
but
simply
on
the
fcc's
adoption
of
an
agency
argument
that
competition
had
triggered
a
need
for
accelerated
depreciation,
which
triggered
a
need
for
preemption,
and
that
argument
ignores--
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
--we
would
make
the
same
argument,
your
honor--
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
--and
you
are
right,
we
do
not
accept
that
assumption
which
is
the
basis
for
the
fcc's
action.
we
don't
accept
that
assumption
for
several
reasons,
one
of
which
is
that
depreciation
is
but
one
of
many
factors,
and
it
is
far
down
the
list
on
the
list
of
factors
which
affect
a
management's
decision
to
modernize
plant
or
to
replace
it.
certainly
rate
of
return,
the
trading
value
of
stock,
interest
rates
and
all
of
these
other
factors
are
much
more
important
in
the
equation,
and
if
the
fcc
is
allowed
to
preempt
on
a
deeply
routed
police
power
based
upon
this
guise
of
plant
modernization
which
it
was
able
to
derive
from
its
general
responsibility
by
the
power
of
its
imagination,
then
where
do
we
draw
the
line?
what
can't
it
preempt?
what
the
fcc
is
really
doing
by
asking
the
court
to
adopt
this
general
responsibility
language
as
a
gateway
to
preemption
is
inviting
a
trolley
ride.
it
is
one
way.
it
has
no
brakes
on
it.
and
it
is
destined
inevitably
to
result
in
the
dissolution
of
dual
regulation.
but
section
220(j)
of
the
act
tells
the
fcc
that
if
it
has
problems
with
dual
regulation,
it
isn't
to
do
away
with
it
by
administrative
order.
it
is
to
do
a
study
and
make
its
case
to
congress.
but
the
fcc
hasn't
made
its
case
to
congress,
and
it
hasn't
asked
for
new
legislation.
it
has
simply
taken
unto
itself
an
attempt
to
expand
its
jurisdictional
guidelines.
we
think
that
the
fourth
circuit
has
clearly
erred
in
endorsing
that
order,
and
that
it
should
therefore
be
reversed.
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
no,
your
honor,
because
what
that
analogy
refers
to
is
the
fact
that...
let
me
explain
what
the
analogy
meant,
and
then
why
i
don't
think
it
cuts
against
us
at
all.
by
the
analogy
i
was
referring
to
the
fact
that
the
fcc
is
attempting
to
tell
the
states,
in
fact
the
very
purpose
of
its
order
is
to
tell
the
states
what
dollar
and
cent
depreciation
accruals
have
to
be
included
in
local
rates.
now,
section
213(h)
preserves
to
the
states
the
power
to
classify
property
or
the
power
to
value
property,
and
the
valuation
of
property...
picture
yourself
attempting
to
determine
what
a
telephone
pole
is
worth
under
a
fair
value
jurisdiction,
which
was
the
brunt
of
the
jurisdiction
back
in
1934.
one
question
you
would
ask
yourself
is,
how
long
is
it
going
to
last?
their
position
is
that
the
states
can
go
out...
well,
they
haven't
conceded
this,
but
section
213(h)
clearly
provides
that
the
states
would
go
out
and
ask
that
question,
how
long
is
it
going
to
last,
to
determine
the
value,
but
that
the
fcc
would
come
in
and
tell
them
how
long
it
is
going
to
last
for
the
purpose
of
developing
depreciation
charges.
and
that
is
inconsistent,
and
that
is
what
i
meant
when
i
referred
to
on
person
on
the
accelerator
and
the
other
person
on
the
wheel.
you
wouldn't
be
able
to
develop
depreciation
charges
that
way.
it
wouldn't
work.
i
think
the
implication
of
your
question,
your
honor,
is,
if
we
have
two
different
bodies
setting
depreciation
charges
for
one
telephone
pole,
don't
we
have
one
person
on
the
pedal
and
another
person
on
the
wheel,
and
the
answer
is
no
because
congress,
i
think,
correctly
recognized
that
you
can
easily
separate
the
costs,
and
then
each
jurisdiction
can
deal
with
the
costs
under
its
power
for
the
purpose
of
developing
local
rates
and
allowing
capital
recovery.
and
47
years
of
history
demonstrate
that
the
process
has
worked
extremely
well.
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
well,
your
honor,
i
think
there
would
be
disasters
in
two
forms.
one
would
be
the
immediate
rate
effect,
which
we
estimate
at
about
a
billion
dollars
a
year
that
local
customers
would
have
to
bear
in
rates,
and
the
problem--
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
--because
of
the
elg
and
the
remaining
life
concepts,
which
would
be
forced
onto
states
by
the
fcc.
it
would
be
about
a
billion
dollars
a
year.
and
as
the--
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
--yes.
in
new
york
we
estimate
the
effect
for
this
year
would
be
about
$120
million,
your
honor,
and
the
problem
with
that
is
the
brief,
the
amicus
brief
of
tracer,
the
telephone
ratepayers
for
a
cost
based
and
equitable
rates,
which
was
a
business
association
of
business
users
of
telephone
service,
points
out
that
that
rate
increase,
which
the
department
of
defense
indicated
below
would
not
be
justified
and
wouldn't
really
serve
any
purpose,
would
have
the
affect
of
causing
business
customers
to
try
to
get
off
the
network,
and
that
would
lead
to
investment
which
was
out
there...
it
wouldn't
be
serving
anybody...
called
stranded
investment,
which
would
force
other
rates
upward.
you
would
have
a
spiraling
effect,
self-perpetuating,
which
would
then
force
other
people
off
the
system,
all
based
upon
the
fcc's
application
of
a
broad
brush
to
a
set
of
circumstances
really
requiring
a
fine
stroke.
we
may
have
competition
out
there.
we
do.
and
the
states
recognize
that.
and
we
are
willing
to
deal
with
that
in
the
development
of
depreciation
charges,
but
certainly
you
don't
have
the
same
competition
in
peoria
that
you
do
in
houston,
and
it
is
the
regulators
in
those
states
who
are
best
able
to
evaluate
this
competition
and
determine
its
effect
on
depreciation
lives.
so,
the
first
effect
would
certainly
be
increased
rates,
and
that
would
be
deleterious
to
the
states.
the
second
effect,
your
honor,
that
we
are
concerned
with
is,
if
the
fcc
is
upheld,
where
does
that
lead
us?
if
it
is
able
to
preempt
depreciation
and
accounting
based
upon
this
broad-gauged
approach
of
plant
modernizing,
which
isn't
even
set
forth
in
the
act,
why
can't
it
then
attempt
to
preempt
all
of
the
factors
on
the
list
of
relevance
to
plant
modernization
which
are
above
depreciation,
such
as
rate
of
return
and
other
factors
which
are
again
an
integral
part
of
state
regulation?
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
if
the
fcc
takes
action
simply
for
the--
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
--yes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
with
respect
to
interstate
usage?
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
oh,
yes,
there
is
no
question
there
has
been
bypass
which
has
resulted
from
rate
increases.
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
the
republic
hasn't
come
to
an
end,
your
honor,
no.
thank
you.
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
thank
you
very
much.
your
honor,
the
telephone
industry
has
argued
that
the
congress
merely
reenacted
section
25
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
which
the
icc
had
read
as
allowing
preemption
although
no
court
had,
and
rejected
a
number
of
arguments
by
the
states
and
provisions
which
would
have
preserved
the
status
quo,
which
at
the
time
was
the
state's
regulation
of
depreciation
in
accounting
matters.
what
the
telephone
industry
has
ignored
is
that
congress
indeed
did
provide,
and
the
legislative
history
clearly
supports
this,
a
number
of
provisions
in
response
to
the
state's
request
that
its
authority
be
clarified.
sections
220(j),
152(b),
and
213(h)
were
all
additions
to
the
communications
act
from
the
interstate
commerce
act
clearly
designed
to
protect
the
states.
with
respect
to
the
history,
what
has
gone
on
for
the
last
50
years,
the
solicitor
general
suggests
that
the
three-way
meetings
have
led
to
the
fcc
setting
rates
which
the
states
have
followed.
the
facts
are
otherwise.
we
have
in
our
briefs
references
to
state
decisions
which
were
published
in
the
fifties,
sixties,
seventies,
and
eighties
which
deviated
from
the
fcc
practices.
we
have
a
letter
which
is
appended
to
the--
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
--your
honor,
the
decisions...
it
is
documented
in
our
briefs.
there
is
a
letter
from
the
fcc
appended
to
the
louisiana
brief
which
says
to
the
state
of
new
york,
we
know
you
have
deviated
from
our
rates
and
you
have
every
right
to
because
you
have
jurisdiction
over
these
matters.
it
is
in
black
and
white.
it
is
signed
by
the
secretary
of
the
fcc.
it
is
appended
to
the
louisiana
reply
brief.
at
page
45
of
the
california
petition,
the
appendix
to
the
california
petition,
the
fcc
says
unequivocally,
the
states
have
the
right,
they
have
the
right
to
deviate.
they
have
done
so
for
40
years.
we
have
no
right
to
tell
them
to
do
otherwise.
i
think
the
history
is
very
clear.
justices
rehnquist
and
stevens
asked,
is
it
not
true
that
accountants
have
differed
over
depreciation
and
accounting.
the
answer
is
clearly
yes,
and
so
has
the
fcc,
and
the
fcc
admits
that
at
page
23
of
the
joint
appendix,
where
it
says
there
is
no
right
or
wrong
to
depreciation,
and
the
suggestion
by
the
telephone
industry
here
today
that
unless
there
is
one
regulator
setting
depreciation
charges,
we
won't
have
accurate
depreciation
is
belied
not
only
by
the
fcc's
statement
at
page
23
of
the
joint
appendix,
which
it
made
before
attempting
to
preempt,
but
also
the
fact
that
there
are
a
number
of
telephone
companies
who
are
not
here
today.
part
of
the
bell
system,
pacific
telephone
and
telegraph,
they
are
not
supporting
this
preemption
case,
because
in
those
states
the
fcc
is
setting
rates
faster--
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
--they
absolutely
are
not
in
support
of
it.
pacific
telephone
and
telegraph
is
not
in
support
of
the
fcc's
position.
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
your
honor,
i
think
by
just
checking
the
service
list
to
the
telephone
company's
brief,
we
will
see
that
there
are
many,
many
telephone
companies...
the
telephone
companies
who
are
getting
rates
higher
from
the
states
are
not
supporting
preemption
because
there
is
one
issue
here
from
the
telephone
company's
point
of
view.
it
is
not
accurate
depreciation
rates,
it
is
money.
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
well,
as
far
as
mr.
boudin
is
not
representing
the
telephone
industry,
that
is
correct.
he
is
representing
the
telephone
companies
which
have
supported
the
fcc.
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
oh,
yes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
who
are
supporting
the--
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
--any
telephone
companies
supporting
our
position
affirmatively?
no,
there
are
not,
your
honor.
that
would
be
heresy.
i
don't
think
that
they
would
go
quite
that
far.
0
[generallaughter.]
your
honor,
with
respect
to
valuation,
there
is
no
question
that
the
cannot
tell
the
states
how
to
accrue
specific
depreciation
charges
without
telling
them
the
valuation
of
the
assets
that
are
at
issue.
they
seem
to
concede
indirectly
that
that
would
be
a
very
difficult
case
to
take
over
valuation,
but
yet
that
is
precisely
what
they
are
trying
to
do,
and
i
would
refer
you
to
page
35
of
the
fcc's
brief.
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
because
213(h),
the
valuation
statute,
says
that
the
states
have
the
right
to
set
valuation.
your
honor,
with
respect
to
the
final
point,
which
is
whether
there
are
in
fact
two
hands
on
the
wheel,
and
whether
our
position
is
the
same
as
that
which
has
been
rejected
by
the
lower
courts
with
respect
to
section
152(b)
in
the
past,
it
is
clearly
not
the
same
position.
you
can
uphold
this
in
this
case
without
touching
those
opinions
at
all,
because
we
are
dealing
here
with
joint
costs
which
have
been
separated
and
are
in
the
jurisdiction
of
each,
the
state
and
the
federal
jurisdictions.
thank
you
very
much.
