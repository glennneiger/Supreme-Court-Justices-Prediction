justice
stevens
mr.
fried,
excuse
me
for
interrupting,
but
i
just
was
turning
around
in
my
mind
here
your
opening
remarks
as
a
response
to
his
figure,
i
guess
it
will
be
a
billion
dollars
or
something.
you
are
saying,
well,
in
maryland
it
is
only
a
penny
a
day.
are
you
disagreeing
with
his
overall
figure,
or
are
you
just
saying
it
isn't
very
much
in
maryland?
justice
stevens
what
does
a
penny
a
day
translate
into
in
dollars
per
year
for
the
whole
state?
do
you
know?
sixteen
million.
justice
stevens
but,
mr.
fried,
your
opponent
argues,
and
i
would
be
interested
in
your
response
to
this,
but
if
you
could
take
care
of
this
one
element,
what
about
all
the
other
elements,
such
as
rate
of
return,
and
rate
base,
and
other
factors
that
go
into
rate?
could
you
take
over
those
as
well?
justice
stevens
mr.
solicitor
general,
that
regime
wasn't
imposed
pursuant
to
220(b),
was
it?
justice
stevens
that
is
what
really
raises
my
question
that
you
answered
before
by
saying,
well,
the
commission
has
merely
acted
pursuant
to
220(b)
here.
but
if
they
are
right
on
220(b)
and
the
one
involving
the
use
of
the
phone,
why
couldn't
they
also
use
the
same
argument
or
220(a)
to
prescribe
rates
of
return
and
capital
investment
and
all
the
rest?
justice
stevens
first,
let
me
ask
you,
do
you
think
they
could?
justice
stevens
that
is
a
matter
of--
0
[generallaughter.]
justice
stevens
they
have
said
that
depreciation
was
one
of
those
things
for
the
last
50
years,
too,
but
that
the
fcc
has
now
taken
a
different
view,
and
might
it
also
not
take
a
different
view
of
rate
of
return,
capital
investment,
and
all
the
rest?
justice
stevens
well,
it
is
true
that
the
states
have
done
it
for
themselves
for
50
years,
is
it
not?
justice
stevens
at
least
as
to
intrastate
components.
justice
stevens
did
that
necessarily
govern
the
depreciation
rate
for
purely
intrastate
facilities?
justice
stevens
yes,
i
would
suppose
that
one
could
argue
that
rate
of
return
is
something
of
national
interest,
and
on
a
nationwide
basis
the
federal
agents
would
be
best
able
to
value
what
the
money
market
was
for
the
whole
country,
and
therefore
be
thoroughly
justified
in
saying
the
rate
of
return
ought
to
be
12
percent
rather
than
6
percent.
justice
stevens
it
is
more
a
local
matter,
do
you
think?
justice
stevens
but
certainly
rate
base
is
equally
factual,
isn't
it,
the
capital
investment
and
plant
at
any
given
time?
justice
stevens
it
is
the
other
side
of
the
coin
from
depreciation.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
mr.
boudin,
must
they
also
have
the
same
evaluation
on
the
capital
investment?
justice
stevens
isn't
it
original
cost
less
depreciation?
justice
stevens
does
it
mean,
then,
that
the
commission
rule
has
the
effect
of
determining
what
the
rate
base
will
be
for
all
the--
justice
stevens
--well,
confining
it
to
the
telephone
pole
for
a
moment,
must
the
remaining
cost,
the
remaining
value
of
the
telephone
pole
be
the
same
for
both
federal
and
state
purposes
in
determining
rate
base?
justice
stevens
well,
but
must
it
be
the
same
under
the
commission--
justice
stevens
--say
they
wanted
to
use
their
old-fashioned
method
of
depreciation
for
purposes
of
measuring
original
cost.
could
they
do
so?
justice
stevens
under
the
regulations
as
they
exist
today?
justice
stevens
could
the
commission
forbid
them
from
using
a
different
original
cost
measure--
justice
stevens
--on
valuation
of
a
telephone
pole,
i
am
wondering
if
you
can
have
one
person
driving
and
another
one
working
the--
justice
stevens
why
would
it
be
such
a
difficult
case?
220(a)
specifically
says
the
commission
may
prescribe
forms
of
any
and
all
accounts.
why
can't
they
just
do
that
literally?
