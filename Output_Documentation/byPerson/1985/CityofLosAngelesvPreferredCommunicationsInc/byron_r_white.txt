how
does
that...
how
was
it
anticipated
that
the
franchisee
in
this
area
would
have
constructed
the
system?
has
it
been
constructed?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
it
going
to
be
on
poles,
or
underground,
or
both?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
who
owns
the
poles?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
a
good
share
of
the
system
will
occupy
public
property?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't...
you
are
only
going
to
award
one
license
in
each
area?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you're
going
to
tell
us
pretty
soon
why
that's
reasonable?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
also
have
the
privilege
to
grant
only
one
under
the
federal
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
also
have
the
privilege
of
granting
only
one
under
the
federal
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
anything
in
the
record
with
respect
to
whether
economics
was
a
factor
in
deciding
to
have
only
one
franchisee
per
area?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
no,
whether
the
market
would
support
more
than
one
cable
system
in
an
area.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
may
be
so.
well,
if
that's
the
case
it
wouldn't
hurt
you
to...
no
one
would...
a
second
company
wouldn't
even
want
in?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
streets?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
page?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
farrow,
do
you
think
the
city...
i
take
it
you
think
the
city
may
not
condition
the
right
to
run
a
cable
system
on
a
license
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
franchise
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
can't
go
through
that
process?
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
i
take
it
you
would
say
that
the
city
couldn't
limit
the
number,
even
if
they
said,
well,
six
companies
may
do
so
but
not
seven?
justice
byron
r.
white
strictly
a
market--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
what
about
the
point
that...
i
take
it
your
answer
has
to...
i
guess
i
know
what
your
answer
is.
since
they
can't
license
at
all,
they
can't
limit
the
license
to
one
on
the
first
go-around,
do
you
agree
that
the
license
that
has
been
issued
in
these
areas
is
not
exclusive?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
saying,
they
say
they
are
non-exclusive?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
that
since
the
public
property
issue
may
influence
the
decision,
i
take
it
we'd
have
to
look
at
every
city
in
the
country,
at
least
deciding
this
case
wouldn't
decide
the
cases
in
other
cities?
well,
if
you
win
here,
it
may
be
that
in
other
cities
the
lawyer
in
your
position
would
lose?
justice
byron
r.
white
doesn't
the
federal
law--
justice
byron
r.
white
--doesn't
the
federal
law
contemplate
the
issuance
of
franchises
or
licenses
by
localities?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
that
means
it
anticipates
that
there
will
be
licenses
issued,
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
you
say
that
statute
must
be
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
told
me
your
case
was
that
the
city
had
no
business
issuing
a
license
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
they
can...
so
you
agree,
the
city
could
insist
that
before
you
run
your
cable
system
you
have
to
get
a
license
from
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
ordinary
business
license,
like
you
have
to
have
some
qualifications?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
they
can
treat
you
different
than
a
newspaper?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then,
the
city
could
issue
one
license
at
the
first
option
and
then
they
could
issue
another
at
the
next
option?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think--
justice
byron
r.
white
--they...
in
their
process
they
should
have
some
minimum
requirements
that
operators
must
meet?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
anybody
who
measures
up
to
then
ought
to
have
a
license?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
as
many
as
apply,
if
they
all
qualify,
meet
those
minimum
standards,
there
should
be
that
number
of
licenses
issued?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
did
apply
for...
you
did
go
to
the
city
and
say,
"get
me
a
license"?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
they
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
said
no,
but
why?
they
must
has
given
you
some
reason.
justice
byron
r.
white
--do
you
think
the
city
of
los
angeles
could
have
said,
we're
not
going
to
grant
any
franchises,
we're
going
to
run
our
own
cable
television
operation
in
the
whole
city,
it
will
be
the
sole
operator
of
cable
television
in
the
city
of
los
angeles?
would
that
stand
up
under
the
first
amendment,
do
you
think?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
be
deciding
all
the
time
what
the
program
was,
the
city
would
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
there
are
a
lot
of...
aren't
there
a
lot
of
cities
that
run
their
own
cable
system,
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes,
but
how
about
your
operating
it?
how
about
your
operating
it,
your
being
the
sole
voice
that
the
people
hear
on
the
cable?
