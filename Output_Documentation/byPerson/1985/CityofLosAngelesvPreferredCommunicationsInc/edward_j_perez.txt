mr.
edward
j.
perez
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
before
you
today
as
a
result
of
a
decision
by
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
in
that
decision
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
the
city
of
los
angeles
may
not
limit
access
to
its
public
utility
poles,
public
utility
ducts,
by
way
of
an
option
process,
if
space
permits
further
construction.
before
i
commence
argument,
your
honors,
i
would
like
to
state
the
key
points
of
my
argument
and
then
briefly
summarize
the
facts.
this
case
is
really
only
about
digging
up
streets
and
hanging
coaxial
cable
on
utility
poles.
point
number
two,
our
process
is
not
unique.
it
has
evolved
over
two
decades'
worth
of
experience,
in
approximately
7,000
other
situations
in
this
country.
the
proper
first
amendment
analysis
is
the
third
point.
we
believe
it
is
under
the
public
forum
doctrine.
the
public
forum
doctrine
says
that
in
a
non-public
forum
mode,
nondiscriminatory
regulations
need
only
be
reasonable.
very
briefly,
your
honors,
the
key
facts
of
this
case
are,
the
city,
pursuant
to
california
state
law,
requires
a
cable
operator
to
obtain
a
franchise.
the
city
awards
these
franchises
through
a
competitive
bid
process,
and
we
select
only
one
franchisee.
in
october
of
1982,
the
city
of
los
angeles
opened
up
the
south
central
area
for
a
competitive
bid
process.
preferred
communications,
the
respondent
in
this
case,
did
not
participate
in
that
competitive
bid
process.
instead,
preferred
communications
informally
requested
that
the
city
grant
them
a
franchise.
the
city
denied
that
informal
request,
and
preferred
communications
filed
a
lawsuit
in
the
district
court
in
los
angeles.
they
alleged
antitrust
violations,
and
they
also
alleged
first
amendment
claims.
the
city
of
los
angeles
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
pursuant
to
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
12-b-6.
we
allege
they
failed
to
state
sufficient
facts
to
constitute
a
claim
upon
which
relief
may
be
granted.
the
district
court
dismissed...
granted
on
motions
the
district
court
found
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
construct
the
cable
television
system
on
government
property
without
government
permission.
preferred
communications
appealed
to
the
ninth
circuit.
the
ninth
circuit
sustained
the
motion
with
regard
to
the
antitrust
claims,
but
reversed
on
first
amendment
grounds.
we
then
appealed
to
this
court,
and
this
court
denied
our
appeal
but
granted
certiorari.
the
first
point,
your
honors,
is
that
we
really
are
dealing
with
the
construction
of
a
cable
system.
the
respondent
has
raised
many
issues
which
may
be
important
and
may
sometime
have
to
be
decided
by
this
court,
but
today
the
only
issue
is,
do
they
have
a
constitutional
right
to
construct
the
system
on
government
property.
this
is
not
a
case--
mr.
edward
j.
perez
--your
honor,
that
is
not
in
the
record.
if
you
would
like
an
answer--
mr.
edward
j.
perez
--a
combination,
your
honor.
what
was
envisioned
was
approximately
770
miles
of
aerial
cable
and
approximately
25
miles
of
city
streets
in
south
central
los
angeles.
mr.
edward
j.
perez
it's
a
combination,
your
honor.
the
telephone
company
owns
some,
but
the
majority,
the
department
of
water
and
power.
mr.
edward
j.
perez
the
majority
of
the
system
will
be
on
public
property,
your
honor,
and
if
it's
not,
the
fact
that
it's
on
city
rights
of
ways,
we
control
the
rights
of
ways
so
i
don't
think
the
fact
that
a
private
pole
involved
really
is
important
in
this
case.
so,
this
is
not
a
case,
your
honors,
where
you
have
to
consider
cable
with
newspapers,
that's
not
really
an
issue
here.
what's
at
issue
is
constructing
a
system
for
south
central.
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
court
needs
to
decide
the
first
amendment
rights
of
cable.
we
concede
that
they
have
first
amendment
rights,
so
that's
not
really
at
issue
in
this
case.
this
case
really
isn't,
when
you
stop
and
look
at
the
situation,
a
case
where
you
need
to
decide
content
regulation.
the
ninth
circuit
looked
at
our
rfp
and
our
process,
and
they
found
that
it
was
not
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
so,
the
issue
would
be,
if
any,
was
it
applied
discriminatorily.
well,
it
was
virtually
impossible
to
do
that
because
preferred
did
not
participate
in
our
system.
so,
how
could
we
discriminate
against
your
viewpoint?
mr.
edward
j.
perez
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
perez
i
will
tell
you
in
my
reasonable
arguments
exactly
why
we
do
what
we
do,
and
that
it
is
reasonable.
mr.
edward
j.
perez
our
franchise
process
envisions...
it
is
not
exclusive.
however,
we
would
probably
not
award
another
application
unless
it
was
justified,
but
that
avenue
is
open.
we
have
a
non-exclusive
franchise,
and
our
bid
process
says,
if
you
look
at
58-200,
it
says
that
in
each
process
you
must
select
the
highest
responsible
bidder.
so,
in
the
process
you
select
one,
but
you
can
have
a
subsequent
process,
and
it's
up
to
the
applicant
who
initiates
the
subsequent
process
to
say
yes,
the
city
of
los
angeles,
one
cable
company's
not
doing
it.
give
us
a
chance
to
do
it
also.
we
would
then
evaluate
that
second
process
and
make
a
decision.
mr.
edward
j.
perez
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
perez
well,
i
don't
think,
justice
o'connor,
that
you
have
to
take
all
the
allegations
in
the
complaint
as
true.
there
are
some...
in
our
view,
conclusions
in
there
that
this
court
does
not
have
to
accept.
but
even
if
you
did,
if
you
look
at
the
complaint
and
then
you
look
at
the
other
information
that's
before
this
court,
this
court
certainly
has
the
right
to
look
at
the
rfp,
our
franchise
procedure
ordinances,
the
wealth
of
literature
that
we
refer
to
in
our
brief,
and
make
a
decision.
there's
nothing
in
the
complaint
that
limits
the
action
it
took.
mr.
edward
j.
perez
if
you
were
to
accept
just
the
allegations
in
the
complaint,
your
honor,
i
think
you
would
see
that
at
least
in
our
view
he
did
not
sufficiently
allege
content
regulation.
i
mean,
that's
the
dispute,
you
know--
mr.
edward
j.
perez
--that's
correct.
mr.
edward
j.
perez
well,
if
there
is
any
content
considerations
incidental
to
the
process,
your
honor,
and
i
would
suggest
that
as
this
court
held
in
the
rentgen
case,
if
you
look
at
the
predominant
intent
of
the
document
or
the
process
and
really
see
what
the
city
was
trying
to
do,
and
in
the
reasonableness
argument
i
will
show
you
what
we
were
trying
to
do
here,
and
there's
really
no
allegation--
mr.
edward
j.
perez
--the
short
answer
to
that,
your
honor,
is
in
this
case
you
don't
need
to.
you
can
look
at
the
rfp.
if
this
court
wants
to
take
consideration
of
that,
and
there's
facts
in
there
that
this
court
can
use,
utilize
to
make
a
determination
without
a
trial.
mr.
edward
j.
perez
it's
the
highest
responsible
bidder,
your
honor.
and,
justice
rehnquist,
what
happens
is
that
the
overall
applicant
and
all
the
applicants,
we
weigh
very
many,
many,
many
things,
not
just
one
thing.
you
look
at
the
financial
responsibility
of
the
applicant,
can
that
applicant
build
the
system,
and
will
that
applicant
keep
it
going.
will
that
applicant...
does
that
applicant
have
a
technical
expertise
within
which
to
maintain
the
system?
will
it
provide
a
state
of
the
art
system
to
best
serve
the
interests
of
the
public?
mr.
edward
j.
perez
there
are
certain
areas
where
i
think
arguably,
someone
could
allege,
as
the
ninth
circuit
held,
the
impermissible
risk
of
covert
discrimination.
we
ask
for
broad
categories
of
programming
to
see...
or
to
justify
the
substantial
terminal
interest
that
we
believe
is
present,
and
that's
information
diversity.
congress
studied
that
in
cable
act,
a
very
lengthy
discussion
of
that,
and
found
that
that
was
a
governmental
interest
that
we
should
be
concerned
about.
mr.
edward
j.
perez
well,
your
honor,
let
me
get
to
the
reasonableness
portion
of
my
argument,
and
i
think
i'll
address
that
for
you,
and
i
appreciate
your
concerns
and
i
appreciate
the
fact
that
this
is
a
12-b-6
and
you
want
to
look
at
the
face
of
that
document
and
make
a
determination.
but,
we
would
urge
you,
that
number
one,
you
don't
have
to
do
that;
and
number
two,
the
substantial
governmental
interests
that
are
present
outweigh
that.
you
can
balance
that,
and
that's
what
we're
talking
about
here,
a
balancing
process
in
a
reasonable
proportion.
let
me
discuss
that
with
you.
we
believe
we
are
in
a
non-public
forum
category,
and
in
a
non-public
forum
category,
absent
content
regulation
which
we
maintain
we
have
here,
we
have
a
reasonableness
test
as
this
court
has
enunciated
in
cornelius,
perry
and
greenberg.
now,
we
believe
our
process
is
eminently
reasonable
for
the
following
reasons,
your
honor.
it
is
well
thought
out.
over
two
decades
worth
of
experience,
began
back
in
the
1960's
when
the
fcc
first
saw
how
cable
was
starting
to
grow
and
they
couldn't
deal
with
cable.
they
had
to
make
a
decision
and
they
decided,
your
honor,
that
local
communities
know
what's
best
for
local
communities.
they
said,
local
communities,
come
up
with
the
franchise
process.
and
all
across
this
country,
in
approximately
7,000
situations
they
came
up
with
one
franchisee
only,
very,
very
similar
to
what
we
do
in
los
angeles.
the
state
of
california
looked
at
that
when
they
passed
government
code
section
53066.
they
thought
it
through.
they
came
down
to
the
same
conclusion.
congress,
when
they
went
in
its
deliberations,
years
of
study,
years
of
compromise,
years
of
negotiation
which
included
the
cable
industry,
as
well
as
cities,
as
well
as
public
participants,
everybody
got
together.
they
came
out
with
this
result.
now,
you
can
use
all
the
deliberations
and
all
reports,
your
honors,
to
look
at
this
issue.
if
you
want
to
stick
to
the
four
corners
of
the
complaint
there
might
be
a
problem,
and
i
appreciate,
justice
o'connor,
your
concern.
but
you
are
not
limited
to
that.
this
court
has
a
right
to
consider
the
[inaudible]
that
we
would
proffer,
the
rfp,
the
legislative
history
in
the
cable
act,
the
legislative
history
that
california
went
through
when
they--
mr.
edward
j.
perez
--well,
what
it
does,
your
honor,
is
give
you
some
facts
to
dispute
what
might
be
in
the
complaint
that's
troubling
justice
o'connor.
that's
what
it
does.
and
it
shows
the
reasonableness.
now,
what
we
have
to
decide
here
is
what's
going
to
happen
to
cable
in
our
country.
this
case
is
very
important,
and
if
we
have
to
go
back
to
trial
to
prove
some
of
these
issues,
which
we
really
don't
have
to
because
there
is
ample
wealth
of
information
before
you,
then
you're
going
to
have
lawsuits
all
across
this
country
like
you're
having
right
now.
this
case
shouldn't
be
here
before
you.
mr.
edward
j.
perez
well,
clearly,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
even
though
we've
had
two
decades
worth
of
experience,
it's
still
changing
rapidly
and
we
know
that
there
will
be
greater
changes
in
a
couple
of
years.
we
need
to
work
slowly
on
that,
and
we
in
the
city
of
los
angeles
and
other
cities
in
this
country
need
to
make
certain
legislative
assumptions.
we
don't
always
know
what's
going
to
happen
in
the
future.
social
issues
and
economic
issues
are
not
easily
proved
by
facts,
and
this
court
has
acknowledged
the
fact
that
local
communities
can
make
legislative
judgments.
we
ask
you
to
do
that,
and
i
think
that
might,
justice
o'connor,
get
you
over
your
concerns
about
the
base
of
that
complaint.
mr.
edward
j.
perez
what
government
code
section
5306-c
does--
mr.
edward
j.
perez
--it
says
that
local
governments
can
grant
franchises.
it
does
not
say,
necessarily,
restrict
it
to
one.
mr.
edward
j.
perez
that's
right.
mr.
edward
j.
perez
if
they
do
i'm
unaware
of
it,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
perez
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
perez
well,
section
621
of
the
cable
act
says
that
it's
up
to
the
discretion
of
local
governments
to
make
a
decision
to
grant
one
or
more.
they
give
us
the
option.
mr.
edward
j.
perez
as
we
see
it,
your
honor,
yes,
we
do.
mr.
edward
j.
perez
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
edward
j.
perez
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
j.
perez
how
many
franchises
currently,
i
don't
believe
so.
if
the
record
reflects
that
there
are
other
franchise
areas,
it
was
a
scheme
to
break
up
los
angeles
into
certain
geographical
areas.
i
don't
think
it
gives
the
exact
number,
but
i
can
furnish
that
if
you
would
like.
mr.
edward
j.
perez
it
is
a
matter
of
public
record,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
perez
it's
14
franchise
areas
in
the
city
of
los
angeles.
mr.
edward
j.
perez
that's
correct.
we
could
have
14
lawsuits
also,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
perez
yes,
your
honor.
i
see
your
point
now.
excuse
me.
you
could
have
competition,
or
challengers
like
preferred
who
could
come
in
and
wire
14
areas.
mr.
edward
j.
perez
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
j.
perez
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
perez
we
have
14
granted
now,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
perez
not
all
are
completed.
construction
is
not
completed
on
all
of
them.
i
would
like
to
talk
a
little
bit
more
about
the
reasonableness
of
our
process.
there
are
substantial
governmental
interests
that
underpin
our
franchise
process
and
which
we
feel
justifies
what
we
are
doing
in
los
angeles.
there
is
disruption
of
the
streets
and
disruption
of
the
back
yards
and
neighborhoods
in
the
city
of
los
angeles.
when
you
have
a
cable
company
coming
in
to
construct
a
system
or
dig
up
the
streets,
it
causes
traffic
jams,
noise,
debris.
they
go
into
back
yards,
residential
homes,
and
they
scamper
up
poles
and
construct--
mr.
edward
j.
perez
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
perez
well,
your
honor,
i--
mr.
edward
j.
perez
--well,
if
the
court
does
not
take
into
consideration
the
references
of
the
material
that
we
have
in
our
brief
and
the
other
briefs
before
this
court,
there
might
be
some
problem
with
that.
mr.
edward
j.
perez
only
if
you
consider
the
information
that
we
have
referenced
in
our
brief,
your
honor.
if
you
look
only
at
the
four
corners
of
the
complaint,
you
probably
would
not
find
it.
mr.
edward
j.
perez
no,
that
would
not
indicate
a
remand,
your
honor.
we
urge
you
strongly
to
consider
our
rfp,
the
studies
of
the
fcc,
and
there's
plenty
of
information
there,
the
experiences
of
the
7,000
other
systems
in
this
country.
and,
our
system
didn't
come
out
of
someone's
mind
all
of
a
sudden.
there's
constant
deliberation
between
the
city
of
los
angeles
and
other
cities
all
the
time,
and
we
should
be
able
to
utilize
the
experiences
of
other
cities.
mr.
edward
j.
perez
economics
in
which
sense,
your
honor?
we
ask
for
financial
information
to
make
sure
that
they'll
construct
the
system.
mr.
edward
j.
perez
well,
that
is
not
in
the
complaint.
that
is
not
in
the
rfp.
but
that
is
again,
your
honors,
in
all
of
the
literature
which
this
court
may
consider
if
it
wishes,
to
look
at
the
economic
theories,
the
fact
that
cable...
it
costs
so
much
just
to
start
a
cable
system,
the
economies
of
scales
would
weed
out
any
competition.
mr.
edward
j.
perez
well,
a
second
company
might
want
in
for
two
reasons,
your
honor.
number
one,
they
might
not
be
very
smart
and
they
actually
think
they
can't
compete.
number
two,
they
might
want
to
get
in
just
to
make
sure
that
they
have
a
right
to
construct
and
they
will
approach...
and
this
is
happening
across
the
country...
they'll
approach
the
existing
franchisee,
perhaps
merge,
and
we'll
get
a
big
cash
settlement
out
of
it.
that
is
a
motivation
for
competition
in
many
situations,
and
cable
companies
across
this
country
are
selling
out.
you've
seen
this
selling
out
process,
which
is
one
consideration
the
city
takes
when
they
regulate
cable,
is
that
we
try
to
make
sure
that
this
sales
differential,
the
premium
that
is
being
paid
on
to
the
new
cable
company
is
not
placed
in
rates.
however,
that
process,
rate
regulation,
is
now
being
phased
out
so
we
probably
will
not
be
able
to
do
that
again.
but
we
have
substantial
governmental
interests,
assuming
as
we
have
that
cable
is
a
natural
monopoly
and
that
there
will
only
be
one
cable
company
in
there,
multiplicity...
pardon
me,
information
diversity
is
a
key
issue
which
was
discussed
very
thoroughly
by
congress.
in
the
house
report,
pages
30
to
38,
they
balanced
the
interest,
the
first
amendment
rights
of
the
interest
of
the
cable
operator
and
the
viewing
subscriber.
and
viewing
subscriber
is
the
paramount
person
under
consideration,
as
this
court
has
held
in
other
cases,
and
that's
important.
if
preferred
communications
wishes
to
communicate
over
cable,
we're
not
preventing
that.
look
at
cleveland.
we
referenced
that
in
our
brief.
they
have
a
microwave
system
in
their
cable
programming,
without
utilizing
government
property.
why
should
we
allow
preferred
to
come
in
and
utilize
government
property?
we
should
be
able
to
manage
our
property
in
the
public
interest.
we
acquired
that
property
through
eminent
domain.
we
have
a
fiduciary
duty
to
protect
the
interest
for
all
citizens,
the
poor
and
the
rich,
and
we
know
that
cable
companies
will
not
wire
the
poor
areas.
they
are
going
to
wire
the
affluent
areas.
that's
another
substantial
governmental
interest
in
our
process.
it's
a
very
reasonable
process,
and
this
court,
in
perry,
says
alternative
channels
are
very
important.
so,
in
addition
we
have
these
access
channels
for
preferred.
they
really
want
to
speak.
they
really
want
to
speak
over
cable.
they
can
get
one
leased
access
channel
and
have
the
same
amount
of
time
as
cbs,
abc
or
nbc.
so,
that
leads
me
to
one
question.
is
constructing
a
cable
system
a
first
amendment
expression?
do
they
really
want
to
run
the
business,
or
do
they
want
to
express
themselves
over
cable?
they
can
do
it
over
cable
through
the
access
channel,
through
microwave.
they
can
have
some
[inaudible]
systems
set
up,
low
powered
tv.
there
are
many,
many
ways
for
them
to
speak
over
the
medium
they
claim
they
wish
to
speak
on.
we
are
not
preventing
them.
what
we
are
doing
is
regulating
our
right
of
ways
in
the
public
interest.
finally,
as
i
mentioned,
we
really
don't
believe
a
trial
is
necessary.
there
is
ample
information
before
this
court.
we
ask
this
court
not
to
remand.
we
ask
this
court
to
reverse
the
ninth
circuit.
with
remand
we
are
going
to
have
lawsuits
all
across
this
country.
they
are
unnecessary.
i
appreciate
your
concern,
justice
o'connor,
but
there
is
ample
information
before
this
court,
as
this
court
recently
held
in
clark
versus
community
for
creative
non-violence
which
had
much
less
information
before
this
court
than
we
believe
is
here
today,
this
court
rendered
its
decision
in
a
first
amendment
case.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
edward
j.
perez
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
is
a
point
i'd
like
to
make,
but
i
would
first
offer
myself
open
for
any
questions
of
the
court.
one
point
i
want
to
make,
your
honor,
and
i
would
like
to
address
this
to
justice
o'connor,
i
appreciate
your
concern,
your
honor,
about
the
facts
in
the
complaint,
but
our
position
is
that
even
if
they
are
all
true,
the
city
still
acted
reasonably.
we
made
certain
legislative
assumptions
based
upon
experience
with
other
cities,
as
this
court
said
we
may
do
in
the
redman
case,
so
even
if
the
facts
are
true
and
even
if
we
acted
and
it
turned
out
to
be
different
than
what
we
assumed,
that's
not
important.
as
a
matter
of
law,
this
court
can
still
hold
that
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
construct
a
cable
system
in
los
angeles,
and
that
the
city
acted
reasonably.
mr.
edward
j.
perez
i
think
i'm
a
little
confused
at
one
point.
you
mentioned
economics.
i'm
thinking
of
a
natural
monopoly
theory.
is
that
what
you
are
referring
to?
mr.
edward
j.
perez
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
and
i
think,
as
part
of
that...
you
can't
separate
it
completely.
part
of
that
is
the
fact
that
if
you
have
multiple
systems,
you
have
multiple--
mr.
edward
j.
perez
--you've
just
got
one,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
perez
i
think
the
city
if
they
wanted
to
could
operate
a
cable
television
system.
certainly,
if
the
municipality
did
that,
there
would
have
to
be
a
real
close
scrutiny
of
any
kind
of
content
and
programming.
mr.
edward
j.
perez
you'd
have
to
divorce
it
and
have
a
separate--
mr.
edward
j.
perez
--there
are
some,
your
honors.
i
don't
know
how
many.
but
we
could
run
and
construct
the
system,
which
is
what
the
telephone
company
does
in
wisconsin,
for
instance,
and
we
can
construct
it
and
lease
it
back.
there's
nothing
wrong
with
that.
mr.
edward
j.
perez
that
could
cause
some
problems.
that's
why
we're
not
doing
it
in
los
angeles,
your
honor.
thank
you.
