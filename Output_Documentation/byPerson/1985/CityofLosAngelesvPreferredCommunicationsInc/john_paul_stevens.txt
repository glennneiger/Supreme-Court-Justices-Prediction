justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
record
tell
us
how
many
los
angeles
has
granted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
a
matter
of
public
record?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
you
tell
us
what
it
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
it's
conceivable
you
might
be
dealing
with
working
different
franchisees?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
mean
whether
you
get
lawsuits
or
not,
you
could
have...
each
one,
they're
all
allocated
separately?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
mean,
forgetting
competition,
if
you
have
14...
14
separate
licensees
simultaneously
in
different
areas
of
the
city?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you'd
only
have
problems
if
one
wanted
to
expand
into
his
neighbor's
area
or
something?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
farrow,
if
you
agree,
as
i
think
you
did,
with
justice
white
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
you
accept
the
proposition
that
the
license
would
just
impose
some
standards,
health,
safety
and
so
forth,
on
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what
is
it
in
this
bid
proposal
that
you
describe
as
unacceptable
standards?
why
aren't
these
standards
in
this
proposal
acceptable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
think
that's
responsive
to
my
question.
i'm
not
asking
you
what
kind
of
questions
you'd
rather
they
didn't
ask
you.
i'm
asking
you
if
there
are
requirements
in
the
bid
proposal
that
you
feel
you
should
not
be
compelled
to
comply
with.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
one
of
them
was
that
you
have
to
make,
i
think
two
channels
available
to
the
city
or
something
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
the
city
doesn't
have
power
to
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
the
federal
communications
commission
would
not
have
the
power
to
make
a
similar
requirement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
the
federal
communications
commission
have
the
power
to
make
a
similar
requirement
against
the
networks?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
if
you...
do
you
object
to
the
five
percent
franchise
fee,
the
revenue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
question
that
occured
to
me.
assume
for
the
moment
that
there
were
no
physical
problems
of
tearing
up
the
streets
and
clutter
and
litter
and
all
that,
but
just
the
economic
interest
at
stake
and
the
interest
in
kind
of
managing
a
good
operation,
you
might
say.
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
economic
interest
alone
would
be
sufficient
to
justify
a
municipal
decision
to
license
only
one
operator,
even
through
it
were
economically
feasible
to
have
four
or
five?
justice
john
paul
stevens
assume
that
you
couldn't
prove
a
natural
monopoly,
but
rather
the
city
just
thought
that
it
would
be
in
the
interest
of
the
public
if
they
were
able
to
manage
an
operation
and
it
met
all
the
standards
that
you've
got
here,
to
be
sure
they
have
good
management
and
adequate
programming
and
the
right
kind
of
programming.
would
you
think
the
city
would
do
that,
just
for
that
one
interest
in
the
kind
of
operation
that
it
would
be--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
i
say,
put
to
one
side
all
of
that.
assume
that
you
don't
have
those
kinds--
