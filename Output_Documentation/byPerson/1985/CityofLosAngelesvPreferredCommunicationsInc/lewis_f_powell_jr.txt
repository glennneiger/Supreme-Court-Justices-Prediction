justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
perez,
it
will
be
helpful
to
me
if
i
understand
the
status
of
legislation.
does
the
california
statute
authorize
a
city
to
limit
licensees
to
a
single
cable
tv
company?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
expressing--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--it
does
not
express
and
limit
you
to
one?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
does
any
city
in
the
state
of
california
have
a
policy
different
from
that
of
los
angeles
with
respect
to
multiple
or
dual
licensees?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
unaware
of
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
there
anything
in
the
federal
legislation
that
would
restrict
you,
assuming
the
validity
of
that
legislation,
to
licensing
only
one
cable
television
company?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so,
you
do
have
the
right
under
the
legislation
to
grant
more?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
perez.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
excuse
me
for
interrupting
you
again.
but
what
concerns
me
is
the
point
that
justice
o'connor
had
mentioned,
and
the
case
comes
to
us
on
a
10-b-6
motion.
can
we
consider
what
you
are
now
arguing?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
it,
is
there?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
other
words,
you
may
very
well
have
a
substantial
city
interest,
but
do
we
have
the
facts
before
us
in
order
to
decide
that
question?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
would
that
indicate
a
remand?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
farrow.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
take
it
you'd
have
a
different
case
if
the
city
of
los
angeles
owned
its
own
electric
and
telephone
companies?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
have
been
making
that
argument,
haven't
you?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
thought
you--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--you
have
that
in
a
good
many
cities.
i
don't
suppose--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
before
you
sit
down,
is
the...
is
a
copy
of
the
application
that
your
client
filed
with
the
city
in
the
record?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
is
not?
