mr.
perez,
what
exactly
is
the
standard
by
which
the
city
would
award
the
franchise?
is
it
the
lowest
responsible
bidder,
as
you
said,
or
the
best?
how
is
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
there
some
room
for
content
and
regulation
in
there,
or
determination
on
the
basis
of
content?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
does
that
legislative
history,
mr.
perez,
bear
on
the
constitutional
issue?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
language
is
"surplusage"?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
going
to
say
it
was
unnecessary
for
the
ninth
circuit
to
phrase
it
that
way?
is
that
what
you
mean
by
"surplusage"?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
public
utility,
are
you
talking
about
as
a
public
utility
owned
by
the
city
of
los
angeles?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
privately
owned
public
utility?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
those
poles
are
owned
by
the
cities?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
have
they
made
those
poles
available
to
multiple
franchisees
in
the
same
areas?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they
certainly
denied
it
to
your
client.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
defending
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
in
this
case,
mr.
farrow?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
now,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
first
amendment
prevented
the
city
from
doing
this.
you're
making
a
bunch
of
economic
arguments,
as
i
understand,
that
might
make
some
sense
to
a
legislature
but
i
don't
see
that
they
bear
on
the
first
amendment
at
all.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
because
of
the
way
that
the
bidder
or
the
franchisee
is
chosen,
or
do
you
say
that
they
couldn't
limit
it
no
matter
how
the
franchisee
is
chosen?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
thought
you
said
you
were
using
some
public
poles,
a
moment
ago.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
did...
i
misunderstood
you
then,
because
i
thought
you
said
that
you
would
have
to
use
some
publicly
owned
power
poles.
now,
is
that
or
is
that
not
correct?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
you're
not
a
customer
going
to
them
and
asking
them
for
electricity.
you're
a
cable
television
company
that
wants
to
string
a
new
set
of
antennas
and
so
forth.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
maybe
they
don't
want
to
deal
with
deadbeats.
you
presumably
have
to
pay
a
certain
percentage
for
the
franchise.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
isn't
it
perfectly
legitimate,
if
they're
expecting
a
percentage
of
your
revenues
as
a
franchise
fee,
for
them
to
say,
we
want
to
know
if
you've
been
in
any
legal
disputes.
