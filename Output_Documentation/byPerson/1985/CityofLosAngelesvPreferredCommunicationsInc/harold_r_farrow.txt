mr.
harold
r.
farrow
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court:
before
i
begin
by
answering
some
of
the
questions
posed
by
mr.
perez,
let
me
deal
with
one.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
is
that
better
now?
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
all
right.
thank
you.
let
me
deal
with
one
critical
question.
when
mr.
perez
first
began,
he
like
all
of
us
do,
as
we
try
to
phrase
the
exact
question
that
was
answered
by
the
ninth
circuit,
said
it
right.
he
said
the
question
was
whether
or
not
preferred
was
entitled
to
build
its
cable
system
on
public
utility
poles
and
in
public
utility
context.
he
didn't
say
anything
about
public
property
at
that
time.
it
was
only
later
when
he
said,
he's
saying
that
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
build
on
public
property.
now,
when
the
ninth
circuit
posed
the
question
it
said,
you
know,
is
there
a
right
to
limit
this
thing,
and
it
used
in
there,
in
its
phrase,
"public
utility
facilities
and
other
public
properties.
"
now,
that
bit
of
surplusage
had
been
the
source
of
a
major
amount
of
confusion,
and
on
the
briefs
before
you.
the
language
is
"surplusage",
though.
in
1956--
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
--pardon
me.
the
portion
of
the
question
posed
by
the
ninth
circuit
when
he
says,
does
the
city
have
the
right
to
limit
access
to
public
utility
facilities
and
other
public
property,
and
"other
public
property"
indicates
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
form
case
in
some
fashion.
that
is
the
confusing
part.
if
i
may--
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
--yes,
sir.
it
was
surplusage
for
the
ninth
circuit.
they
didn't
need
to
add
that
phrase.
if
they
left
that
phrase
out
it
would
have
been
more
exact
for
the
question
produced.
if
you
look
at
paragraph
8
of
the
complaint,
we
carefully
allege
in
there
that
preferred,
having
been
formed
as
a
cable
company,
went
through
the
utilities,
the
public
utilities,
privately
owned
public
utilities,
and
asked
for
service
which
is
legislatively
defined
in
california
as
a
public
utility
service,
pole
attachment
service
that
was
made
available
to
a
class
of
people.
they
are
a
member
of
the
class,
pole
and
cable
television
companies,
nothing
in
there
about
being
franchised
or
licensed
cable
television
company.
the
statute
says
they're
entitled
to
it,
and
it's
available
from
the
public
utility
as
a
public
utility
service.
public
utility
says
that's
wonderful,
we're
in
a
business
providing
that,
we
accept
that,
we've
been
doing
it
for
20
years,
but
you've
got
to
have
a
license
first.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
no,
sir.
i'm
talking
at
this
stage
about
pacific
telephone
company.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
right,
privately
owned
public
utility,
all
right.
it
says,
you've
just
got
to
get
a
license
first.
as
soon
as
you've
got
a
license,
we
will
let
you
on
our
poles.
we
will
provide
you
pole
attachment
service.
better
than
that,
we'll
even
provide,
if
you
like,
we'll
provide
you
channel
lease
services.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
if
i
may,
the
public
utility,
the
telephone
company
in
california,
has
an
easement
granted
by
the
state
over...
not
the
city
but
by
the
state...
over
all
easements,
all
public
rights
of
way
in
its
whole
operating
territory.
now,
when
it
provides
this
public
utility
service,
the
pole
attachment
service,
it
provides
it
with
its
poles,
its
conduits,
its
anchors,
its
guys
and
tis
easements
and
rights
of
way
over
both
public
property
and
over
private
property,
just
like
it
uses
all
of
those
things
to
provide
you
telephone
service,
or
provide
somebody
transmission
service.
these
things
are
in
its
rate
base.
it's
defined
as
part
of
the
pole
line
account
by
the
uniform
central
accounts
which
were
established
by
the
fcc
and
adopted
by
the
state
of
california.
it
charges
money
for
them.
it
gets
a
rate
of
return
for
them.
and
so
that,
when
it
is
providing
this
service,
it
is
providing...
now,
we're
talking
about
the
utility
property
and
not
public
property.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
no,
your
honor,
for
this
reason.
the
city
does--
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
--no.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
i
haven't
finished
the
argument.
let
me
touch
it.
it's
due
with
it,
because,
you
see,
there
is
coincidentally,
it
happens
in
los
angeles
and
in
a
few
other
places
that
municipally
owned
power
company--
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
--and
that
power
company
does
own
some
poles.
most
of
the
poles
it
owns,
85
to
90
percent
of
the
poles
that
the
city's
power
company
owns
are
jointly
owned
with
the
telephone
company,
and
by
contract
under
the
joint
pole,
southern
california
joint
pole
association,
a
copy
of
which
has
been
[inaudible]
to
this
court,
control
of
the
communication
space
on
the
power
poles
is
surrendered
to
the
telephone
company.
and
so,
when
a
cable
operator
goes
to
the
phone
company,
he
gets
the
right
to
use
the
phone
company's
solely
owned
poles
and
all
the
communications
space
on
the
joint
poles.
but
there's
still
a
few
poles
left
there.
there
are
a
few
poles
that
only
have
power
on
them.
you
know,
you're
not
conscious
of
poles
until
you
get
into
this
silly
business.
when
you
get
out
there,
as
you
walk
along
you'll
see
there
are
some
poles
with
the
power
lines
running
off
the
top,
and
there
are
no
telephone
facilities
in
the
communications
space.
sometimes,
those
poles
are
used,
or
useful
by
cable
television
companies.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
those
are
owned
by
the
city,
and
for
20
years
or
more
the
city
of
los
angeles
has
made
those
poles
available
to
cable
television
companies
for
money.
they're
in
the
business
of
providing
the
same
pole
attachment
service
that
the
telephone
provides.
they
charge
money
for
it,
just
like
the
telephone
company
does.
it
is
a
service,
which
the
state
legislature
has
defined
as
a
public
utility
service.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
your
honor,
i
don't
know
the
question...
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
i
just
know
that
they
have
never
denied
use
of
that
to
anybody
who
has
been
a
cable
company--
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
--in
this
area,
but
not
because...
not
because
of
the
fact
that
we
could
use
those
poles.
let
me
point
out
to
you
that
when
you
go
to
the
telephone
company,
to
show
you
the
difference
here,
you
could
get
the
pole
attachment
service
but
you
could
also
get
the
channel
lease
service.
under
a
channel
lease
service
the
phone
company
builds
all
the
distribution
plant
between
your
head-in
which
is
on
private
property,
and
your
customer
who
is
on
private
property.
it
builds
and
owns
all
of
that,
and
it
uses
it
solely
on
poles,
jointly
on
poles.
its
rights
of
way
on
public
and
private
property,
and
its
right
any
time
it
wants
and
needs
them
pursuant
to
the
joint
pole
agreement,
to
buy
and
use
communication
poles
space
on
any
city
municipal
pole.
now,
if
you...
we
can
do
that.
that
is
the
most
perfect
of
all
leased
channel
facilities.
if
you
really
want
to
have
something
other
than
building
your
own
system,
and
to
talk
about
a
cable
company
ought
to
be
satisfied,
well,
these
channels,
that's
the
best
because
you
can
get
as
many
channels
as
you
want,
100
channels.
you
get
then
at
reasonable
rates.
you
don't
have
the
business
of
congress
saying
to
the
lessor
that
he
can
discriminate
based
upon
a
programming
content.
and
you
can
get
all
of
them.
you
can
get
all
of
those
groups.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
yes,
sir,
your
honor.
i'm
trying,
though,
to
answer
the
questions
that
were
posed
by...
but
let
me
say,
just
to
finish
that
thought,
when
you
go
to
the
phone
company
to
get
that
lease-back
service,
that
leased
channel
service,
they
say
to
you
once
again,
we
still
won't
let
you
have
it
until
you
get
a
license.
what
we're
dealing
with
in
this
case,
it's
not
a
forum
case.
we're
dealing
with
a
licensing
case.
the
city
won't
give
one
license
out,
because
if
it
limits
the
licenses
it
puts
a
value
into
them.
and
mr.
perez
even,
inadvertently,
i
believe,
admitted
that
a
moment
ago
when
he
spoke
of
the
premium.
people
are
trying
to
get
into
the
business
so
they
can
sell
at
a
premium.
what's
happened
is,
if
you
limit
access
to
the
market
you
build
in
a
false
value
to
the
monopolists
that
you
choose,
and
that
is
the
premium
he's
talking
about,
and
the
cities
have
discovered
that.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
my
point,
mr.
justice,
was
that
we're
not
dealing
with
a
form
case,
a
public
property
case.
we're
dealing
only
with
a
simple
licensing
of
speech
case,
and
so
that
the
ninth
circuit
was
correct,
they
cannot
limit
access.
limiting
the
access
is
a
discretionless,
standardless...
pardon
me,
standardless
denial
of
the
right
to
speak.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
i
don't
believe,
if
we
were
50...
if
we
were
30
years
ago
when
we
had
to
use
city
streets,
30
years
ago
before
the
dedication
of
these
services
by
the
public
utilities,
i
believe
that
we
would
have
been
in
a
designated
forum
and
that
would
have
been
a
test.
the
o'brien
test
would
have
been
the
right
test.
but,
because
we
are
not
using
public
property
and
because
it
is
a
simple
denial
of
the
franchise
to
speak,
i
think
we're
dealing
with--
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
--no,
sir.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
the
answer
is
half
true,
okay.
the
question
was...
you
use
those
poles
of
the
city,
perhaps,
perhaps.
you
don't
need
them.
but
you
could
use
those
poles
solely
owned
by
the
city
where
they
have
put
them
into
the...
dedicated
to
the
provision
of
providing
a
public
utility
service.
if
you
went
to
the
department
of
water
and
power
and
said,
i
want
electricity
for
my
house,
that's
all
i
want,
they're
going
to
deliver
that
by
these
same
poles
which
are
dedicated
to
the
provision
of
a
service
which
has
been
legislatively
defined
as
a
public
utility
service.
they
can't
deny
you
that
service.
that's
what
we're
saying.
so,
as--
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
--no,
your
honor.
we
are
a
customer
going
to
them
and
saying,
we
want
the
public...
we
want
pole
attachment
services,
and
they're
saying,
you
can't
have
it
unless
you
have
a
franchise.
if
you
look
at
the
city's
franchise,
look
at
what
they
granted,
at
the
actual
grant
here,
in
this
case.
a
week
after
we
filed
this
complaint
they
selected
a
monopolist,
and
they
granted
him
that.
and
if
you
look
at
what
they
did,
they
break
the
franchise
into
three
parts.
there
are
three
parts--
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
--let's
see,
it's
in
joint
appendix...
one
second...
it
would
be
page
215,
"nature
and
extent
of
the
grant.
"
a,
it
grants
the
right
to
engage
in
business;
b,
the
right
to
erect...
to
build
a
plant;
c,
the
right
to
maintain
and
operate
the
plant.
and
all
we
wanted
was
a.
they
don't
give
us
just
a.
you've
got
to
take
b
and
c,
and
you
can't
get
b
and
c
unless
you
go
through
the
option,
pay
the
money,
win
the
game.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
that's
right.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
i
believe--
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
--it
is...
we
all
admit,
it
is
a
publishing
business.
the
process
is--
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
i
think
that
would
be
wrong,
yes,
sir.
the
chance...
six
or
seven
is,
you
know,
beyond
the
realm
of
possibility.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
but
if
there
were
six
or
seven,
because
the
customers
wanted
to
pay
for
it.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
if
by
its
terms
it
says
it's
not
exclusive,
and
the
reason
why
historically
that's
so...
by
the
way,
there
are
a
number
of
overlapping--
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
--they
say
by
their
terms,
they
are
non-exclusive.
the
only
exclusive
franchise,
well,
i
know
of
two
that
were
issued,
by
the
term
"exclusive
franchise"
in
california,
one
was
down
in
southern
california,
a
town
with
a
name
i
can't
remember,
that
question
of
exclusivity
that
was
tried
at
the
lower
court,
the
lower
court
held
it
was
unconstitutional
of
the
state
constitution
to
be
exclusive,
and
it
was...
that
exclusivity
was
denied.
the
other
one
was
surrendered
voluntarily
by
the
cable
operator.
there
may
be
others,
but
i'm
not--
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
--if
we
win
on
this
point
in
california,
that
would
settle
the
issue
in
california,
because
we
have
the
california
legislature.
there
is
a
comparable
statute,
federal
statute,
section
224,
47
u.s.c.
224,
it
is
the
federal
code
bill
where
the
feds
do
the
same
thing
that
the
state
does.
it
was
adopted,
i
think
within
a
year
or
so
after
the
adoption
of
767.5
of
the
public
utilities
code
in
california.
it
is
not
the
exact,
same
wording.
for
example,
in
california
the
statute
actually
spells
out
the
word,
identifies
the
words,
"public
utility
service",
whereas
the
federal
doesn't
use
that--
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
--they
put
it
into
the
common
carrier
section
of
the
communications
act.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
federal
law
says
only
that
it
can
issue
one
or
more.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
licenses
issued,
yes,
i
guess.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
if...
i
have
a
license,
business
license
as
a
lawyer.
i
assume
that
you're...
you
know,
if
it's
a--
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
--then
i
misspoke,
and
overspoke.
if
it's
going
to
use
the
standard
business
license
where
if
anybody,
you
know,
where
the
legislature
sets
the
rules
and
says
that,
you
know,
if
you're
going
to
run
your
business
run
it
by
these
standards,
then
that's
fine,
okay.
then
they
can
require
a
license.
each
one
can
come
in
and
have
a
constitutional
right--
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
--yes,
if
it's
an
ordinary
business
license.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
no,
i
don't
think
they
can
treat
me
different
than
somebody
else
who
wants
to
be
a
cable
operator.
they
can
say,
for
example,
in
an
ordinary
time,
place
and
manner,
you
can't
put
yourself
on
the
poles
unless
you
provide
insurance,
so
if
the
case
falls
off
the
pole
and
hurts
some
people,
you
know,
that
you
should
have
insurance.
you
know,
that's
a
reasonable
legislation.
you
can
say,
you
know,
you
shouldn't
elect
for
future
customers.
you
shouldn't
steal
from
your
customers.
you
shouldn't
run
[inaudible]
lights.
you
know,
ordinary,
reasonable
health,
safety
and
welfare--
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
--no,
sir.
in
that
case,
if
they're
doing
that...
if
they're
doing
that,
they're
discriminating
between
would-be
publishers,
so
it's
to
give
one
an
advantage
to
get
into
the
market
and
to
get
a
complete
head
start
while
the
other
one
waits,
then
that's
not
proper--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
cities
use
the
non-exclusiveness
of
the
license
that
they
issue
as
a
way
of
controlling
the
speaker
they've
got,
so--
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
--watch
out,
i'll
bring
you
competition.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
right.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
that's
right.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
that's
right.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
the
physical
limit
issue
was
tried
in
the
eculder
cases,
and
there
[inaudible]
distribution
plant
that
in
fact
demonstrated
there
was
room
for
at
least
four,
and
there
were
only
two
trying
to
deal
in
business
affairs
at
the
time.
it
could
be
that,
you
know,
it
could
be
that
there
is
a
finite
limit
to
how
many
people
you
can
put
on
the
pole,
but
those
come
in
increments
of
five
feet,
and
an
ordered
rearrangement
for
the
first
cable
operator,
you
have
to
rebuild
some
of
those
poles.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
yes,
if
they
could
prove--
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
--if
they
can
prove
a
physical
limitation,
then
we're
dealing
in
a
whole
other
ball
game.
then
we're
dealing
with
something
like
broadcast.
but,
they
would
have
to
prove
that,
that's
not
so.
basically,
here
to
china
you
can
put
cable
systems
from
now
on.
there's
no
logical
way
they
could
be...
like
physical...
like
when
you
run
out
of
space
on
the
poles
you
go
underground.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
no,
your
honor.
they
have
no
business
in
there,
no
more
business
in
there
than
they
have
in
running
a
newspaper.
if
a
man
wants
to
lose
money
publishing
what
he
believes
to
be
his
views,
he
should
have
the
constitutional
right
to
do
so.
and
if
he's
mistaken
or
foolish,
then
he
should
have
the
right
to
do
that,
to
be
a
constitutionally
foolish
publisher.
there
may
be
some
in
business.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
i
did
not
hear
you.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
well,
in
the
rfp,
when
you
come
in
to
apply
for
it,
one
of
the
things
that
they
do
is
examine
your
character
as
an
[inaudible]
and
they
also
ask
you
what
your
proposed
program
is.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
i
don't
think
it's
any
of
their
business
what
your
proposed
program
is.
but
here's
a
question,
question
no.
9
on
page
143.
"has
applicant
or
any
principal
ever
initiated
litigation
against
a
franchising
authority,
or
had
a
franchising
authority
initiate
litigation
against
it.
"
you
think
about
that
question,
and
you
think
about
the
question
they're
asking
about
your
proposed
programming,
you
can
see
the
immediate
risk
of
either
viewpoint
discrimination
or
individual
discrimination.
but,
you
don't
even
have
to
guess
about
it.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
well,
then
if
you
turn
to
page...
let's
see,
213
of
the
actual
ordinance
they
did,
there
is
a
whole
list
of
programming.
for
example,
in
the
programming
requirements
that
start,
i
believe,
on
page
2...
something
or
other
here,
run
for
four
or
five
pages
and
specify
exactly
what
these
people
have
to
carry
in
a
program.
in
addition,
you
find
that--
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
--oh,
yes,
you've
got
to
give
channels--
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
--no,
sir.
i
don't
think
they
have
the
right
to
demand
any
percentage
use
of
your
channel
capacity,
any
more
than
they
have
the
right
to
use
any
one
of...
you
know,
one
out
of
every
five
taxicabs
in
a
fleet
of
taxicabs.
the
idea
that
because
you're
in
a
publishing
business,
they
can--
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
--pardon
me?
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
i
don't
believe
so.
i
don't
think
it
would
make
any
difference
which
level
of
government
was
taking
your
property
away
from
you.
it's
a
fifth
amendment
taking.
and
when
they
take
it
they
ignore,
should
there
be
a
requirement
that
you
have
to
give
it
to--
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
--on
page
235,
"inspection
of
property
and
records.
"
"you
have,
in
effect,
a
fourth
amendment
search
here,
the
power
of
the
city
to
an
operating
publisher
to
come
in
and
inspect
all
your
records
about
every
affair
or
transaction
of
your
business
whenever
they
choose.
"
that's...
for
example
on
page
237,
the
section
that
reads,
"signal
carriers
and
channel
allocations".
they
tell
you
for
three
or
four
pages
there
what
you
must
carry
in
the
way
of
programming.
on
page
245
they
require
you
to
spend
$100,000
per
year
for
production
contract,
to
give
that
to
some
outsider.
you
know,
that's
not
part
of
your
business.
somebody
that
is
satisfactory
to
a
commission,
that
they...
that
should
they
set
up
that
they
have
to
prove,
we
have
to
make
available
to
this
outside
production
company
a
line
of
credit
of
half
a
million
dollars.
in
year
five
you've
got
to
spend
another
$250,000
for
a
broadcast
studio
for
them,
and
provide
another
$250,000
fund
to
pay
community
producers
after
five
years,
or
after
year
five.
there
are
just
a
number
of
those
types
of
things
where
they're
saying
the
premium,
the
price,
the
bribe
for
the
exclusivity,
the
de
facto
exclusivity,
we're
going
to
give
you.
this
is
what
the
price
is.
and
if
we
cannot
maintain
that
de
facto
exclusivity,
we
can't
get
all
of
the--
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
--perfectly
willing
and
able
to
meet
all
proper
police
power
requirements.
those
requirements,
we
would
have
argued
about.
if
they
believed
that
that
is
a
proper
requirement
in
order
to
get
a
license,
let
them
pass
a
rule
that
says,
all
cable
operators
must
do
these
things.
and
then
you
can
either
do
them,
or
you
can
test
[inaudible]
in
the
regular
way.
but,
you
don't
have
to
risk
the
right
to
be
a
publisher
in
order
to
quarrel
about
it.
you
see,
what
happens
is,
this
process
traditionally,
we
talk
about
is,
by
saying
we're
going
to
do
one
at
a
time,
it's
going
to
be
non-exclusive,
and
we're
going
to
constantly
hang
over
your
head
the
threat
of
competition
and
the
threat
of
non-renewal
that
control
the
press,
right,
and
the
applicants
can't
complain
about
it.
you
remember,
they
asked
you
a
while
ago,
what
other
franchising,
sir,
have
you
ever
sued?
you
sue
one,
the
next
time
you
to
to
them
they're
going
to
remember
it
and
they're
going
to
know
about
it
and
you're
not
going
to
win
that
discretionless
award
of
the
thing.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
a
bonding
requirement
might
be
appropriate,
and
for
any
proper
fees
that
are
due,
or
any
proper
situation,
it
might
well
be
that
they're
entitled,
and
require
a
bonding
requirement.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
i
think
that
if
you...
i
think
that
is
an
impermissible
request
to
deal
with...
maintain
a
control
over
a
publisher,
and
that
kind
of
request
frightens
the
publisher,
the
effect
of
which,
what
you
have
is,
the
form
of
the
press
which
is
moist
valuable
in
this
country
to
report
on
local
government,
school
councils,
city
councils,
school
board,
whatever,
is
frightened
to
speak
out.
you
know,
just
as
you
don't
hear
cbs
doing
exposes
on
the
fcc,
you
don't
hear
cable
companies
doing
exposes
on
what's
going
on
down
at
city
hall.
you
just
don't
dare.
your
very
existence
depends
upon
the
continued
good
will
of
this
franchising
authority
under
this
process.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
right.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
they
said--
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
--have
to
go
through
the
rfp
process.
you
can't
just
have
section
a
alone,
can't
have
just
one
of
these.
you've
got
to
take
them
all,
you
know,
so
you've
got
to
go
down
and
you've
got
to
compete
under
that
process.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
well,
that's
not
in
this
lawsuit.
but
it
will
certainly
be
in
one
in
the
near
future,
without
any
question.
the
concept
that
five
percent
of
the
gross
revenue,
over
and
above
any
cost
of
regulation,
can
be
siphoned
off
this,
of
course
all
these
other
things,
seems
totally
inappropriate
to
me.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me,
you
know,
that...
you
have
this
strange
situation
where,
you
know,
government
intrusion
into
the
affairs
of
business
generally
are
the
lightest
when
you
deal
with
retail
or
light
manufacturing,
and
if
you're
going
to
carry
acids
or
frozen
materials
you
get
a
little
bit
more
government
regulation,
because
of
safety
problems.
then,
if
you're
a
public
utility,
you
get
even
more
because
now
they're
going
to
regulate
your
rates
and
your
capital
costs,
or
whatever.
these
processes
start
off
with
utility
regulations
and
then
add
more.
they're
going
to
run
your
programming.
they're
going
to
tell
you
how
to
handle
your
customers.
they're
going
to
tell
you
how
or
whether
or
not
you
can
stay
in
business.
and
they're
going
to
supervise
you,
like
these
boards
that
you
have
to
set
up
here,
spelled
out
in
this
thing,
that
they
approve
all
of
that.
it
goes
on
and
on.
and
the
question,
if
i
can,
i
say
let
me
deal
just
quickly
with
a
couple
of
points
i've
raised.
we're
talking
about
cream
skimming.
you
know,
in
the
materials
that
are
lodged
with
the
court
are
the
materials
from
palo
alto,
even
though
it's
a
different
lawsuit
than
the
l.a.
lawsuit.
they
were
filed
with
the
ninth
circuit
in
connection
with
a
motion
for
filing
an
amicus
brief,
and
they've
traveled
with
it
and
they're
here.
in
palo
alto,
those
documents
demonstrate
that
palo
alto,
menlo
park
and
east
palo
alto
got
together
as
a
franchising
authority
run
by
the
city
of
palo
alto.
east
palo
alto
is
the
ghetto,
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
freeway,
160
homes
per
mile
of
town.
atherton
is
the
beverly
hills
of
the
peninsula,
40
homes
per
mile
of
town.
the
critical
factor
in
the
choice
of
the
franchisee
there
was
whether
or
not
each
household
in
the
whole
area
would
get
exactly
the
same
pricing
treatment--
[inaudible]
the
mayor
of
atherton
wanted
to
make
sure
that
his
house...
his
house
is
up
there,
his
estates...
didn't
get
charged
a
higher
price
than
they
did
down
in
the
ghetto.
now,
here
we
are
in
los
angeles
with
two
black
professionals
trying
to
get
the
right
to
build
the
black
section,
the
watts
section
of
los
angeles.
the
rest
of
the
town
has
been
built
for
years,
and
when
they
talk
about
cream
skimming
it
seems
almost
superficial.
one
last
thing,
we
have
mentioned...
there's
been
mention
at
several
[inaudible]
about
the
potential
for
corruption,
and
improper
government
that
comes
about
with
this
kind
of
a
pork
barrel...
in
sacramento,
there's
a
piece
of
litigation
going
on
and
sacramento
is
going
to
make
its
brief
in
here
too.
there's
a
piece
of
litigation
going
on
here
that
demonstrates...
as
a
matter
of
fact
two
pieces
of
litigation,
demonstrate
that
there
the
city
and
county
got
together
and
gave
a
nonexclusive
franchise
to
a
cable
television
company
which
agreed
to
pay
certain
kinds
of
these,
what
i
call
bribes,
so
long
as
they
were
protected
from
competition.
the
total
of
that
money
for
the
term,
15-year
term,
is
roughly
$50
million.
according
to
a
complaint
filed
by
the
city
against
that
cable
company,
the
amount
of
money
in
1986
alone,
that
that
involved,
was
$10
million.
now,
in
the
minute
sacramento
lets
a
second
cable
operator
in
there,
they
lose
those
goodies.
that's
what
we're
dealing
with,
with
this
rfp
process.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
no,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
r.
farrow
no.
