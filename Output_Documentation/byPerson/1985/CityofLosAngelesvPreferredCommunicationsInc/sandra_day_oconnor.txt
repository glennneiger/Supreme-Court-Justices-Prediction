mr.
perez,
doesn't
this
case
come
to
us
as
a
result
of
a
12-b-6
motion?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
don't
we
have
to
take
the
allegations
in
the
complaint
as
true
for
purposes
of
our
inquiry?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
my
concern
is
that
apparently
you
concede
that
there
are
some
first
amendment
values
at
stake
here,
and
that
there
has
to
be
some
weighing
process
which
goes
on,
and
faced
with
the
allegations
and
the
complaint
that
are
made,
i
wonder
how
that
can
be
done
properly
in
a
12-b-6
motion,
frankly.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
complaint
alleges
that
the
city
will
award
the
franchise
only
to
the
single
company
it
deems
best?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
which
would
appear
on
its
face
to
be
some
sort
of
a
content
based
determination.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but,
isn't
that
the
kind
of
thing
that
you
go
to
trial
on
and
let
the
city
prove
its
interests,
and
whether
those
interests
are
sufficient
to
overcome
the
first
amendment
interests
of
the
company.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
perez,
the
complaint,
though,
alleges
that
it
is
entirely
feasible
to
string
another
cable
on
the
poles,
and
that
according
to
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
it
would
not
be
a
burden
to
city-owned
property
to
enable
another
cable
to
be
strung,
and
serve
the
same
areas
of
the
city
that
the
city
wants
served.
now,
faced
with
those
allegations,
how
should
we
on
a
12-b-6
motion
determine
that
the
city
has
a
sufficient
interest
to
prevail
over
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
farrow,
it
is
difficult
to
hear
you.
do
you
think
you
could
raise
the
podium,
or
speak
up?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if
there
are
some
physical
limits
to
the
number
of
cables
that
can
be
strung
in
the
amount
of
space
in
the
eight
of
way
to
be
occupied?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
there
were
physical
limitations,
do
you
agree
that
the
city
could
take
that
into
account--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
limiting
its
franchises?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
the
city
can
legitimately
consider
the
economics
of
this
situation
in
issuing
the
franchises,
or
must
that
be
something
the
city
cannot
consider?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
farrow,
i
understood
that
the
allegations
of
your
client's
complaint
was
that
they
were
perfectly
ready,
willing
and
able
to
meet
all
the
requirements,
just
asking
that
they
be
given
a
franchise.
