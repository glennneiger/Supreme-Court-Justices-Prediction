justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
a
little
puzzled,
because
i
have
the
same
difficulty
justice
o'connor
does.
judge
weinstein
talks
repeatedly
about
this
covert
policy,
evidence
of
a
fixed
clandestine
policy,
the
effects,
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
i
don't
understand
that
to
be
consistent
with
your
description
of
open
discussion
with
the
people
who
were
affected
by
the
policy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
may
be
absolutely
right.
i
have
a
great
deal
of
confidence
in
what
you
tell
me
about
the
record,
but
the
trial
judge
describes
the
clandestine
policy.
you
don't
challenge
that
in
any
of
your
questions
presented,
as
i
read
it.
so
don't
we
have
to
assume
that
there
was
some
kind
of
clandestine
policy.
you
are
telling
us
there
wasn't.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
is
a
policy
which
according
to
the
trial
judge
prevented
the
members
of
the
class
from
knowing
the
basis
of
decision
of
their
claims
and
therefore
deterred
them
from
seeking
further
review.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
you
get
findings
of
fact
against
you
from
the
trial
judge,
and
he
has
been
taking
bribes,
and
you
don't
know
it,
you
may
just
think
the
findings
aren't
worth
challenging.
you
have
a
lot
of--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--he
decided
the
case
for
a
reason
he
did
not
disclose.
that
is
what
the
basic
policy
is,
as
i
understand
it,
that
there
was
a
policy
that
determined
a
great
number
of
decisions,
and
the
decisionmakers
didn't
tell
the
people
they
were
ruling
against
why
they
were
doing
it.
am
i
wrong?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
think
there
is.
if
there
is
a
controlling
reason
in
every
case
and
he
decide
not
to
tell
them,
i
disagree
with
you
rather
dramatically
on
that.
there
surely
is
a
requirement
if
there
is
a
principle,
general
rule
that
governs
decision
in
a
classic
case,
and
the
person
making
the
decision
doesn't
disclose
that,
i
don't
think
he
is
performing
his
public
responsibilities.
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
the
1984
act
passed
before
or
after
the
district
court
decision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
presumably
they
knew
about
the
decision
and
may
not
have
thought
anything
more
was
necessary.
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
they
indicate
any
disapproval
of
those
decisions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
argument
is,
as
i
understand
it,
that
they
made
a
number
of
special
reopening
provisions
in
other
areas
of
the
law.
they
didn't
do
it
here,
but
if
they
knew
about
what
had
been
done
in
this
case,
they
really
didn't
have
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
the
appeals
counsel?
did
they
know
about
the
policy?
