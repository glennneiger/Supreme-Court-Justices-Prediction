well,
mr.
kneedler,
i
guess
the
problem
is
that
the
district
court
founds
that
the
secretary's
policy
involved
in
this
case
was
a
covert
one.
it
had
been
hidden
from
public
scrutiny.
how
is
somebody
who
doesn't
know
of
the
policy
at
all
or
have
a
reason
to
know
according
to
the
district
court's
finding
going
to
meet
the
requirement,
and
that
is
why
you
have
to
meet
the
so-called
tolling
argument,
i
think.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
didn't
it
label
it
covert?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
didn't
file
any
challenge
to
that
in
this
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
didn't
raise
it
in
the
cert
petition,
did
you?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
dispute
to
that
finding?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
so
don't
we
just
take
that
as
a
given?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
talk
about
it,
but
i
had
just
assumed
we
had
to
take
that
finding
as
a
given.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
know,
i
am
troubled
by
your
characterization
of
the
claim
as
being
a
challenge
to
the
thinking
process.
i
had
understood
that
what
was
being
argued
is
that
under
the
statutory
and
regulatory
scheme,
these
applicants,
these
people
with
mental
deficiencies
are
entitled
to
a
fair
individualized
assessment
at
the
initial
stage
instead
of
just
application
to...
or
half.
i
thought
that
was
what
it
was
all
about.
