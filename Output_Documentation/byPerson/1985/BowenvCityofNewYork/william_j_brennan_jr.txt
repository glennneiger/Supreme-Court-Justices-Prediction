justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
kneedler,
is
that
quite
accurate?
i
thought
that
the
trail
court
found
that
even
the
alj's
were
unaware
of
what
the
physicians
were
doing
under
the
policy.
isn't
that
so?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
the
only
ones
who
knew
anything
whatever
about
it
were
the
state
and
perhaps
also
the
federal
agency,
but
it
wasn't,
as
justice
o'connor
said,
something
that
was
made
generally
known
to
the
public,
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
see
how
the
class
members
could
have
raised
this
question
before
the
agency
if
they
didn't
know
about
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
will
you
tell
me
just
when
the
policy
of
resuming
the
existence
of
residual
capacity
of
claimants
who
don't
have
a
listed
mental
impairment,
when
did
that
policy
become
publicly
known?
as
of
what
date?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
form
did
it
take
when
it
was
finally
made
public?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
is
the
form
that
the
public
notice
took?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
what
judge
weinstein
was
particularly
concerned
about
was
that
the
decisions
of
the
review
physicians
were
based
on
a
policy,
a
per
se
policy
rather
than
on
a
medical
judgment,
and
that
fact
was
never
made
known
to
the
claimants.
even
the
alj's
didn't
know
that.
they
handed
what
the
physician
had
to
say
pursuant
to
whatever
the
policy
was
without
making
an
independent
medical
judgment.
isn't
that
it?
isn't
that
what
judge
weinstein
found?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
claimants
who
wanted
to
attack
that
were
unaware,
could
have
attacked
it
within
60
days,
they
weren't
aware
that
was
being
done.
if
they
had
known
about
it,
they
would
have
appealed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
he
didn't
know.
he
didn't
know
how
the
medical...
how
the
physician
were--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--he
didn't
know
it.
didn't
you
argue
about
what
you
don't
know
anything
about?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
a
time
limit
on
the
petition
for
review
to
the
appeals
counsel?
