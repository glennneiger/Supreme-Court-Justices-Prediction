justice
william

rehnquist
well,
you
say
pervasive
subverting
of
the
legal
process
itself.
that
is
a
very
fine
sounding
phrase.
would
it
include
a
regulation
by
the
secretary
which
a
court
were
later
to
find
invalid
announcing
a
presumption
in
the
case
of
certain
decisions,
but
that
there
was
no
violation
of
any
administrative
regulation--

--what
if
a
court
were
later
to
find
that
that
regulation
was
unauthorized.
would
it

case
involving
the
government?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
is
quite
contrary
to
our
decision
in
a
case
like
hibbey,
where
we
say
that
estoppel
does
not
apply
against
the
government,
even
though
it
does
apply
against
private
parties.
