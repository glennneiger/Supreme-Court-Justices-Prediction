i
know
it
is
de
novo.
i
know
it
is
wide
open.
but
it
is
not
that
wide
open.
it
also
has
rules
in
it
which
say
that
when
it
gets
to
us
we
are
going
to
go
this
way.
there
are
only
two
people
that
don't
know
that.
that
is
the
alj
and
the
recipient.
everybody
else
knows
it.
how
many
levels
of
review
are
there
after
the
administrative
law
hearing?
