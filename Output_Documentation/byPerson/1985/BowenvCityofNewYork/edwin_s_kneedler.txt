mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
presents
important
questions
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
of
a
federal
district
court
in
cases
arising
under
the
social
security
act.
congress
granted
its
consent
to
such
suits
when
it
enacted
section
405(g)
of
title
42.
but
congress
imposed
two
specific
restrictions
on
that
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
first,
congress
has
provided
that
judicial
review
is
available
only
after
"the
secretary's
final
decision,
after
a
hearing.
"
and
secondly,
judicial
review
is
available
only
if
the
individual
commences
an
action
within
60
days
after
the
mailing
to
him
of
the
notice
of
the
final
decision
or
within
such
further
time
as
the
secretary
may
allow.
this
court
has
repeatedly
made
clear
in
yamasaki
and
diaz
and
salfi
that
in
order
for
a
person
to
be
include
as
a
member
of
a
class,
he
must
individually
satisfy
the
jurisdictional
requirements
of
that
section.
in
other
words,
in
order
to
be
included
in
the
class,
he
has
to
have
been
to
file
his
own
individual
suit
when
the
suit
was
filled.
the
courts
of
appeals
in
this
case
completely
disregard
these
principles.
respondents
brought
this
suit
to
challenge
the
manner
in
which
evidence
of
mental
impairment
was
being
evaluated
by
the
new
york
state
agency
under
several
regulation
issued
by
the
secretary
to
implement
the
statutory
definition
of
disability.
any
member
of
the
class
in
this
case
who
disagreed
with
a
state
agency's
decision
that
he
was
able
to
work
and
therefore
was
not
disabled
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
was
free
to
take
an
administrative
appeal
to
the
alj,
to
the
appeals
counsel,
and
then
to
seek
judicial
review
in
district
court.
in
fact,
in
this
case
seven
of
the
eight
individuals
who
are
claimants
in
this
case
did
go
to
the
alj
stage.
several
of
those
were
awarded
benefits
by
the
alj.
others
were
denied
benefits
on
grounds
unrelated
to
the
policy
of
which
the
claimants
object
in
this
case.
although
the
thousands
of
unnamed
class
members
in
this
case
were
explicitly
informed
that
they,
too,
had
a
right
to
seek
further
review,
including
going
to
the
alj
and
appeals
counsel,
they
declined
to
do
so.
when
they
declined
to
seek
review
in
60
days,
their
decisions
became
final
and
binding
against
them,
and
they
therefore
accepted
the
consequence
that
those
decisions
were
in
effect
res
judicata.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
district
court
labeled
the
policy
secret,
but
all
it
could
have
meant
by
secret,
i
submit,
is
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
don't
know
if
that
word
was
used
specifically,
but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
it
wasn't...
if
what
the
courts
below
meant
by
that
was
there
was
some
affirmative
act
of
concealment
of
what
was
going
on,
then
we
certainly
do
dispute
that.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
oh,
yes,
i
think
it
is
at
page...
on
the
second
to--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--not
as
a
separate
question
as
such.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
on
page
26
of
our
certiorari
petition,
we
point
out
and
we
have
repeatedly--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--we
don't
regard
it
as
a
finding,
and
have
not
throughout,
and
this
is
what
we
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals
at
oral
arguments
and
in
the
rehearing
petition,
that
all
that
happened
here,
and
all
the
plaintiffs
really
tried
to
establish
at
trial
was
that
the
various
memoranda
that
they
relied
upon
as
evidence
of
the
policy
were
not
published,
or
were
not
routinely
made
available
to
the
claimants.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the
alj's--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
i
am
not
suggesting
that
it
was
published,
but
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
application
of
the
regulations
that
these
memoranda
refer
to
were
contained
in
the
sort
of
routine
internal
memoranda
that
go
on
all
the
time
in
the
administration
of
the
program.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
question
is
not
whether
they
could
have
raised
this
specific
question.
the
issue
is
whether
they
knew
their
claims
were
denied
on
the
basis
of
a
finding
that
they
could
work.
the
decision
that
the
class
members
in
this
case
received
from
the
state
agency
said
that.
while
your
ability
to
do
some
things
is
limited,
we
cited
these
in
our
brief,
it
has
been
determined
that
you
are
able
to
do
some
work,
that
you
are
not
disabled.
if
you
disagree
with
that,
you
can
seek
further
review
within
60
days.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
don't
know
that
it
can
be
pinpointed.
it
was
being
litigated
in
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
it
was
litigated
in
the
minnesota
mental
health
case
out
in
minnesota,
and
there
were,
as
i
understand
it,
freedom
of
information
act
requests
for
regional
documents
that
referred
to
this.
so
that
may
have
been
the
occasion.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
you
said
when
it
became
public.
i
misunderstood.
the
objection
that
is
being
raised
here
is
the
manner,
in
a
sense
almost
the
thought
process
by
which
an
adjudicator
decides
whether
a
person
can
work,
and
what
the
claimants
are
objecting
to
is
that
the
regulations
were
misapplied
in
a
certain
way
by
an
adjudicator.
whether
that
in
turn
is
attributable
to
an
internal
memorandum
or
the
thought
processes
of
the
individual
state
agency
adjudicator
seems
to
us
to
be
irrelevant
for
purposes
of
the
ability
of
a
claimant
to
seek
review.
if
it
was
found
out
a
year
later
that
a
particular
adjudicator
was
consistently
applying
wrong
principles
at
the
state
agency
level,
this
would
not
excuse
a
claimant
from
seeking
further
review
within
60
days,
just
as
if
a
case
was
being
tried
in
the
district
court
and
it
came
to
light
that
the
district
judge
who
decided
the
case
was
under
a
misapprehension
of
how
a
law
should
be
applied
and
had
entered
judgments
that
didn't
spell
out
his
thinking
but
denied
benefits
even
in
a
social
security
case.
that
wouldn't
excuse
a
claimant
from--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
that
is
the
legal
argument,
but
that
is
different
from
the
claim
for
benefits.
section
405(g)
does
not
provide
for
judicial
review
of
policies
or
positions
of
the
secretary.
it
provides
for
judicial
review
of
decisions
by
the
secretary
on
claims
for
benefits,
and
if
a
particular
approach
to
the
way
a
claim
was
decided
remains
an
issue
at
the
time
a
case
gets
to
the
appeals
counsel,
then
the
way
in
which
a
case
was
finally
disposed
of
by
the
secretary
is
subject
to
judicial
review
when
the
person
files
a
suit
under
section
405(g),
but
all
through
the
process
what
a
claimant
seeks
review
of
is
the
denial
of
his
claim
for
benefits.
to
the
extent
the
decisionmakers
approached
the
problem
sheds
light
on
that.
that
in
turn
is
subject
to
review.
but
what
he
is
seeking
review
of
is
the
denial
of
his
claim.
the
particular
objection
that
the
claimants
have
here
is
that
they
suggest
that
rfc
was
determined
in
an
inappropriate
manner,
but
rfc
is
not
an
end
in
itself.
the
rfc
calculation
is
part
of
the
manner
in
which
the
decisionmaker
weighs
the
evidence
of
the
impairment
and
decides
whether
it
prevents
the
claimant
from
working.
it
is
an
essential
element
of
the
merits
of
the
dispute,
so
someone
who
is
disagreeing
with
the
way
a
decisionmaker
made
that
decision
is
in
effect
just
disagreeing
with
the
decisionmaker's
decision
that
he
could
work,
and
the
claimants
in
this
case
were
specifically
informed
of
all
the
relevant
information
that
they
needed
to
pursue
the
denial
of
their
claims.
as
i
said,
they
were
told
that
it
had
been
found
that
they
could
work,
that
they
were
therefore
not
disabled,
and
that
if
they
disagreed
with
that
determination,
they
could
seek
further
review
within
60
days.
the
sort
of
memoranda
that
are
relied
upon
by
the
claimants
in
this
case,
i
would
like
to
say
several
things
about
it.
first,
there
is
no
suggestion
anywhere,
and
we
have
repeatedly
pointed
this
out,
and
the
plaintiffs
have
not
disputed
it,
that
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
of
an
intent
to
conceal
anything
from
claimants.
the
policy
disagreements,
to
the
extent
there
were
ones,
were
openly
discussed
between
the
state
agency,
were
openly
discussed
between
the
state
the
agency
and
ssa,
within
ssa,
and
they
were
debated.
the
other
point
is
that
the
disability
programs
are
of
massive
dimension.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
first
of
all,
it
was
certainly
openly
discussed
with
the
state
agency.
the
state
of
new
york
is
a
plaintiff
in
this
suit
alleging
a
secret
policy,
and
yet
the
memoranda
that
were
being
discussed
were
routinely
shared
with
the
state
agency
that
was
adjudicating
the
claim.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
is
a
label.
i
mean,
if
that
had
been
regarded
as
factual
finding--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
second
part
of
the
decision,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
basis
for
concluding
that
the
10,000
class
members
were
deterred
by
the
failure--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that
is
an
extrinsic
sort
of
corruption
of
the
system.
that
is
something
quite
different
from
saying
a
judge
made
an
error
on
the
merits
in
the
way
he
decided
a
case.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
that...
they
wrote
a
decision
that
explained
they
had
arrived
at
the
conclusion
the
person
could
work,
but
there
is
no
requirement
that
a
decisionmaker
has
to
give
the
basic
outlines
of
his
decision,
but
there
is
no
requirement
that
he
explain
all
of
the
thought
processes
that
he
goes
through,
in
the
same
way
that
there
is
no
requirement
that
the
district
court
fully
explain
every
step
that
it
went
through.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
i
guess
the
question
has
to
be
in
a
case
like
this,
as
i
was
starting
to
say
before,
there
are
4,700
state
agency
employees
who
adjudicate
these
claims,
14,000
employees.
not
all
of
them
are
as
expert
as
alj's.
they
aren't
lawyers.
they
don't
necessarily
have
that
sort
of
background.
in
order
to
maintain
some
quality,
some
nationwide
consistency,
the
secretary
through,
not
through
the
alj
process,
but
through
a
separate
program
side,
has
to
give
guidance
and
training
to
the
decisionmaker.
it
is
about
how
you
approach
a
certain
kind
of
case.
these
cases
come
in
a
fairly
large
volume,
and
the
person
who
is
taking
them
in
has
to
know
how
to
approach
them,
and
so
they
get
guidance,
instructions
from
others
who
are
responsible
for
running
the
program,
and
they
follow
those
steps
routinely,
and
a
claimant
who
gets
a
decision
that
is
based
on
that
policy,
if
he
decides
not
to
appeal
it,
just
like
in
any
other
system,
he
has
to
be
taken
to
have
made
a
knowing
decision
not
to
challenge
the
finding
that
he
could
work
and
that
he
wasn't
disabled.
that
is
the
fundamental
question
in
a
social
security
case.
if
we
were
in
a
position
where
the
secretary
had
to
reopen
closed
cases
that
the
claimants
themselves
had
abandoned
whenever
a
memorandum
sent
to
a
state
agency
contained
erroneous
advice,
there
would
be
no
response
at
all
in
the
administration
of
the
social
security
program.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
is
what
he
found.
that
is
what
he
concluded.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
an
alj's
hearing
is
not
an
appeal
from
the
state
agency's
decision.
it
is
a
de
novo
consideration
at
which
the
claimant
is
perfectly
free
to
argue
that
he
does
not
have
the
rfc
to
work
without
regard--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
the
fact
that
he
didn't
know
the
way
the
state
agency
person
decided
it
in
no
way
prevented
him
from
arguing
to
the
alj
that
he
did
have
the
rfc...
that
he
did
not
have
the
rfc
to
engage
in
unskilled
work.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
but
that
did
not--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--an
application
for
disability
benefits
is
based
on
the
allegation
by
the
claimant
that
he
has
a
mental
in
this
case
impairment
that
prevents
him
from
working.
the
decision
that
he
got
from
the
state
agency
was,
no,
you
don't.
you
may
have
a
mental
impairment,
but
it
doesn't
prevent
you
from
working.
the
claimant
knows
that
the
fundamental
issue
in
the
disability
case
has
been
against
him.
in
order
to
challenge
that
before
the
alj,
he
doesn't
have
to
know
the
approach
that
the
decisionmaker
made
at
the
state
agency
level.
all
he
has
to
know
that
in
his
view
he
thinks
he
can
work,
and
that
he
does
not
have
the
rfc
combined
with
his
age,
education,
and
work
experience
to
work.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
it
hasn't
been
decided
in
any
conclusive
manner
against
him.
the
alj
can
and
frequently
does
receive
new
evidence
on
the
question
of
whether
the
person
can
work
and
the
degree
to
which
his
impairment
prevents
him
from
working.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
the
alj
hearing
is
a
de
novo
determination
at
which
the
claimant
starts
all
over
again.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
there
is
one
more
administrative
layer
of
review.
that
is
the
appeals
counsel,
which
is
designed
to
maintain
nationwide
uniformity
over
the
alj's.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the
appeals
counsel
has
discretion
whether
to
hear
it
or
not.
anyone
can
apply
for
it,
but
the
appeals
counsel
grants
review
if
there
is
a
question
of
nationwide
importance
or
there
appears
to
be
a--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--pardon
me?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
0
[generallaughter.]
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
at
every
stage
of
the
administrative
process
there
is
a
60-day
time
limit,
and
the
claimant
is
specifically
told
that,
and
at
most
of
the
levels
of
administrative
review,
particularly
after
the
reconsideration,
before
the
alj
level,
he
is
told
that
he
can
call
up
a
phone
number
at
ssa
and
ask
for
more
information
if
he
wants
to,
if
he
thinks
that
he
needs
it.
the
problem
in
this
case
is
that
the
rationale
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
not
premised
on
the
existence
of
a
secret
policy
in
the
sense
that
there
was
affirmative
concealment
of
anything.
the
district
court's
premise
of
tolling
in
this
case
on
the
60-day
filing
was
that
as
long
as
the
secretary's
approach
or
the
state
agency's
approach
to
this
remained
undisclosed,
that
the
60-day
time
limit
would
run
apparently
for
as
long
as
the
policy
remained
undisclosed.
if
this
had
been
adopted
in
1976
and
came
to
light
in
1982,
under
the
court
of
appeals
rationale,
there
is
no
reason
why
those
old
claims
could
not
be
reopened,
and
this,
it
seems
to
us,
is
fundamentally
inconsistent
with
the
explicit
judgment
of
congress
in
section
405(g)
recognized
by
this
court
in
califano
versus
sanders,
that
a
claimant
has
only
60
days
within
which
to
seek
further
review.
also,
it
is
important
to
keep
in
mind
here
the
role
that
section
5
of
the
social
security
disability
benefits
reform
act
of
1984
plays
in
this.
when
it
enacted
section
5,
congress
specifically
focused
on
the
question
of
mental
impairments.
it
specifically
focused,
and
i
would
like
to
read
the
house
report
to
you,
that
serious
questions
have
been
raised
by
federal
courts,
professionals
in
the
field
of
psychiatry
and
vocational
counseling
and
gao
about
the
adequacy
of
ssa's
listing
of
mental
impairment
and
the
appropriateness
of
ssa's
current
methods
of
assessing
residual
functional
capacity
and
predicating
ability
to
work
in
individuals
with
mental
impairments.
that
is
the
precise
issue
raised
in
this
case.
what
congress
did
when
it
enacted
section
5
of
the
1984
act
was
to
extend
a
moratorium
the
secretary
had
previously
adopted
to
direct
her
to
finish
something
that
she
had
undertaken
on
her
own,
which
was
to
reexamine
the
criteria
for
evaluating
mental
impairments
and
to
reevaluate
the
listing.
and
even
before
this
suit
was
filed,
the
secretary
had
undertaken
those
measures.
then
what
congress
did
not
provide
a
remedy
for
people
who
might
have
been
wrongfully
denied
benefits
under
the
prior
approach,
it
said
that
any
claimant
whose
claim
was
denied
after
march
1
of
1981
could
reapply
for
benefits
and
have
his
claim
reexamined
under
the
new
standards
the
secretary
promulgated,
which
were
finally
promulgated
last
august.
so
any
class
member
in
this
case
whose
claim
was
denied
after
march
1,
1981,
which
was
as
far
back
as
congress
chose
to
go,
can
reapply
for
benefits
under
the
special
regime
that
congress
established
for
dealing
with
this
problem.
congress
did
not,
however,
provide
for
the
reopening
of
the
past
decisions
in
which
those
claims
were
originally
denied.
congress,
in
order
to
do
that,
it
would
be
necessary
for
a
court
to
excuse
the
failure
of
class
members
to
seek
further
review
within
60
days
and
to
exhaust
their
remedies.
congress
knew
how
to
do
that,
too,
when
it
wanted
to
do
so,
when
it
wanted
to
excuse
claimants
from
their
failure
to
comply
with
the
rules,
because
in
section
2
of
the
1984
act,
congress
took
class
actions
as
they
were
then
existing
when
it
enacted
that
act
on
the
medical
improvement
question
and
said
all
such
class
members
can
be
sent
to
the
secretary
to
have
their
claims
reevaluated,
whether
or
not
they
satisfied
the
60-day
rule
or
the
exhaustion
requirement.
so
congress
looked
at
that
problem
and
took
that
approach.
it
did
not
take
that
approach
under
section
5
of
the
1984
act.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
was
passed
after
the
district
court's
decision.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
was
passed
after
the
court
of
appeals
decision
as
well.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the
decision
in
this
case,
the
jurisdictional
questions
were
not
really
addressed.
this
was
and
the
minnesota
case
were
discussed
in
the
legislative
history,
including
a
mention
of
the
notion
that
it
was
a--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
it
was
still
pending
on
appeal,
and
the
point
was
that
the
problem
congress
perceived
was
not
one,
while
it
viewed
the
second
circuit,
the
new
york
example
as
an
example
of
what
had
happened,
congress
perceived
that
this
was
a
problem
of
nationwide
dimension
and
fashioned
a
nationwide
solution.
it
didn't
provide
for
grandfathering
class
actions
that
happen
to
have
been
filed,
and
that
is
what
congress
did
in
the
section
2
on
the
medical
improvement.
it
didn't
grant
relief
to
everybody
nationwide.
it
granted
relief
where
there
was
already
a
class
action
pending,
and
i
think
in
these
circumstances
before
the
court
should
adopt
an
approach
to
the
jurisdictional
requirements
under
405(g)
that
is
potentially
openhanded
and
gives
rise
to
a
hydraulic
pressure
to
dispense
with
the
necessary
rules,
it
should
have
a
pretty
compelling
reason
to
do
so,
and
the
fact
that
congress
has
stepped
in
and
addressed
what
it
perceived
was
perhaps
a
systemic
problem
i
think
makes
it
unnecessary
for
the
court
to
have
to
fashion,
judicially
fashion
rules
of
exhaustion
or
60
days
here.
i
think
we
are
entitled
to
take
congress
at
its
word
in
doing
this.
as
i
say,
the
court
of
appeals
rationale
was
simply
that
what
the
state
agency
decisionmakers
did
was
not
affirmatively
disclosed.
well,
something
is
supposed
to
be
affirmatively
disclosed.
the
rule
would
be
to
require
publication
of
it,
or
to
seek
review
and
to
say
that
in
the
review
process
the
agency
can't
rely
on
something
that
previously
hadn't
been
published,
but
the
motion
that
something
contained
in
a
memorandum
that
is
not
published
in
the
federal
register
excuses
somebody
from
complying
with
the
fair
and
simple
procedural
rules
that
govern
this
program
is
really
quite
an
openhanded
principle,
and
we
think
it
would
really
lead
to
havoc
in
the
administration
of
the
social
security
act.
by
the
same
token,
the
court
of
appeals'
approach
to
the
exhaustion
question
was
not
at
all
dependent
upon
the
motion
of
a
secret
policy
in
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
adopted
what
it
called
an
ad
hoc
balancing
approach
to
the
question
of
exhaustion
rather
than
adhering
to
the
strict
final
decision
requirement
where
judicial
review
is
available
only
after
a
hearing,
which
suggests
that
everything
that
would
be
resolved
in
a
hearing
has
to
be
resolved
before
judicial
review
is
there,
and
the
only
exception
this
court
has
recognized
to
that
was
in
the
case...
was
in
matthews
versus
eldridge,
which
precisely
fits
the
three-part
test
for
the
cohen
doctrine
for
the
collateral
order
doctrine
under
1291
which
uses
the
same
final
decision
language.
we
have
a
very...
from
this
court's
decisions
and
what
congress
has
said,
a
very
precise
jurisdictional
regime
that
is
fair
and
reasonable
for
the
claimants.
the
court
of
appeals
approach
would
greatly
undo
that.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
make
several
points
about
the
secret
policy
point.
first,
this
is
a
time
limit
for
a
suit
against
the
government.
this
court
has
made
clear
that
such
a
limit
could
be
told,
if
at
all,
only
upon
a
showing
of
affirmative
misconduct
by
the
government.
here
the
district
court
did
not
even
reach
the
question
of
whether
the
apa
required
these
internal
memoranda
to
be
published.
there
has
been
no
finding
that
the
statute
was
violated
by
not
giving
more
complete
decisions,
explanations
of
the
decisions
to
include
this
particular
approach.
respondents
raise
that
issue
for
the
first
time
in
this
court.
third,
the
named
plaintiffs
in
this
case
all...
seven
of
the
eight
all
went
to
the
alj.
they
were
not
deterred
or
misled
by
the
government
from
seeking
further
review.
and
fourth,
the
unnamed
claimants,
none
of
them
invoked
the
procedure
congress
has
set
out
for
extending
the
time
limit
when
equity
warrants
it.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
alj's
were
not
bound
by
it.
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
111-a
there
is
a
specific
mention
of
an
alj
disregarding
an
rfc
determination
by
a
judge.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
right.
in
fact,
this
is
precisely
the
issue
presented
in
ringer.
in
ringer,
the
claim
was
that
the
claimant
was
not
getting
a
fair,
individualized
consideration
of
his
claim
for
surgery
at
the
first
two
levels--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--precisely.
they
would
not
be
unaffected
by
it,
but
the
point
in
ringer
was
that
claimants...
and
there
it
was
a
conclusive
presumption.
the
claimants
could
not
recover
in
the
first
two
levels
of
review
no
matter
what
they
said.
the
court
said
that
you
have
to
exhaust
administrative
remedies.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
am
not
sure.
i
am
not
sure
about
that.
one
point
on
the
collateral
issue
argument.
if
this
issue
is
collateral,
then
there
is
no
reason
why
respondent
should...
the
class
members
should
be
entitled
to
have
their
claims
for
benefits
reopened.
this
was
truly
collateral.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
claims
for
benefits.
it
is
entirely
separate
from
the
merits.
but
what
they
are
trying
to
do
is
require
the
secretary
to
go
back
and
reopen
claims
even
though
they
were
specifically
told
that
they
could
seek
further
review
within
60
days
because
they
could
not
work
or
because
they
could
work,
and
they
declined
to
do
so.
also,
there
is
no
affirmative
misconduct
in
this
case
in
the
sense
that
it
be
required.
it
was
simply
a
misapplication
of
the
law.
i
urge
the
court
to
look
at
the
documents
in
the
case.
there
is
no
suggestion
of
an
intent
to
subvert
the
applicable
regulations.
the
decisionmakers
were
trying
to
implement
them
in
the
best
way
they
knew
how.
i
suggest
the
court
look
at
joint
appendix
page
41
and
47
and
the
transcript
at
page
127,
140,
196,
747
to
756,
and
789.
a
reading
of
those
does
not
leave
anyone
with
the
impression
that
there
was
affirmative
misconduct
going
on
in
this
case.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
