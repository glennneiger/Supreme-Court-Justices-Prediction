mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
what
happened
here
in
the
social
security
administration
was
highly
disturbing,
as
was
found
by
the
courts
below
in
a
series
of
detailed
findings
which
the
government
did
not
challenge
on
appeal
and
did
not
raise
in
their
cert
petition
to
this
court.
the
question
for
this
court,
however,
is
whether
relief
can
be
awarded
responsive
to
conduct
unbefitting
an
agency
of
the
united
states
without
opening
the
door
to
an
excessive
or
premature
use
of
the
courts
in
derogation
of
the
usually
appropriate
administrative
scheme
of
review.
and
so
i
want
to
start
by
describing
a
very
narrow
rule
where
full
exhaustion
is
excused,
a
rule
that
arises
from
what
one
hopes
are
the
unique
or
at
least
truly
extraordinary
circumstances
of
this
case.
then
i
want
to
show
why
this
narrow
exception
fits
directly
within
what
this
court
has
said,
particularly
in
eldridge
and
ringer.
the
principle
test
of
waiver
of
exhaustion
suggested
by
this
case
is
indeed
narrow
because
the
circumstances
are
so
unusual.
let
me
try
and
lay
the
test
out.
where
the
government
by
use
of
a
pervasive
procedural
practice
which
is
secret,
which
is
in
flat
derogation
of
regulations
or
a
general
rule
per
the
comment
of
mr.
justice
stevens,
which
functions
to
deprive
a
class
of
claimants
of
the
right
guaranteed
by
statute
to
a
meaningful
first
level
evaluation
and
where
further
administrative
review
cannot
possibly
give
you
the
lawful
first
level
process
which
you
were
denied,
then
further
administrative
review
is
excused.
debate
is
possible
on
whether
each
of
those
elements
is
indeed
absolutely
necessary,
but
all
of
those
elements
were
found
to
be
the
fact
by
the
judge
below
and
by
judge
larson
in
minnesota.
let
me
make
clear
what
we
do
not
suggest.
it
is
obviously
not
enough
for
a
claimant
to
argue
that
the
initial
decisionmaker
made
a
legal
or
factual
mistake
in
the
claimant's
particular
case.
in
such
circumstances,
there
is
no
collateral
right
to
assert
because
the
statute
and
the
regulations
here
obviously
do
not
contemplate
that
the
initial
decisionmaking
process
be
error
free.
individual
mistakes
are
precisely
what
administrative
reviews
are
designed
to
correct.
a
fair
and
meaningful
decisionmaking
process,
not
a
perfect
one,
is
what
is
expected.
we
also
are
not
saying
that
an
erroneous
general
interpretation
of
the
law
is
enough.
rather,
what
we
are
saying
is
that
where
there
has
been
a
pervasive
subverting
of
the
legal
process
itself,
further
exhaustion
was
not
required.
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
no,
if
you
had
a
regulation
which
is
within
the
administrative
discretion
of
the
secretary,
and
i
will
assume
that,
like
in
your
decision
in
ringer,
the
matter
was
clearly
discretionary.
the
secretary
issued
a
regulation
on
whether
or
not
a
certain
operation
would
be
covered.
you
cannot
excuse
exhaustion
just
because
you
disagree
with
that
regulation,
but
that
is,
of
course,
not
this
case.
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
first,
you
don't
have
to
reach
that
here.
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
okay.
the
regulation
was
simply
unauthorized,
was
unconstitutionally
unauthorized,
or
what?
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
i
don't
think
you
are
going
to
excuse
exhaustion
there,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
so.
but
of
course
that
isn't
this
case.
here
we
have
a
flat
contradiction
of
the
regulation
in
two
respects.
the
regulation
called
for
there
being
a
separate
process
after
step
3
to
assess
by
a
medical
person
whether
the
claimant
had
or
did
not
have
residual
functional
capacity,
and
they
simply
passed
a
per
se
rule
or
adopted
secretly
a
per
se
rule
that
truncated
the
process
and
eliminated
steps
4
and
5.
in
addition,
the
regulations
called
for
medical
professionals
to
make
those
judgments
with
respect
to
rfc,
and
as
the
findings
in
this
case
demonstrate,
the
views
of
the
medical
professionals
were
just
plain
disregarded.
so
in
those
two
respects
our
case
is
different
than
the
one
you
posed,
your
honor.
now,
our
primarily
collateral
claim
is,
and
the
unchallenged
finding
of
fact
was
that
the
initial
decisionmaking
process
had
been
made
a
meaningless
and
unfair
hurdle
instead
of
an
opportunity
for
an
objective
review
of
the
medical
facts
by
medical
professionals,
and
the
regulation,
as
i
said,
stated
quite
flatly
that
where
the
impairment
was
severe,
as
it
was
in
this
case
for
all
class
members,
but
they
didn't
meet
the
listings,
there
should
be
an
rfc
evaluation
by
doctors,
and
that
simply
was
not
done.
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
it
came
to
light,
your
honor,
not
until,
as
was
found
by
judge
weinstein,
not
until
after
both
the
minnesota
case
and
the
filing
of
this
case.
there
is
a
specific
finding
to
that
effect,
and
you
can
tell
me
the
page
of
it
in
a
minute,
but
there
is
a
specific
finding
to
that
effect.
moreover,
judge
larsen...
the
minnesota
case
was
a
little
bit
ahead
of
this
case,
and
in
that
case,
judge
larsen
in
his
opinion
granting
attorneys'
fees
against
the
government
on
the
ground
that
their
defense
of
fact
had
been
fundamentally
unreasonable,
found
that
they
had
said
in
the
minnesota
case
that
they
had
lied
in
the
minnesota
case.
they
had
said
this
was
a
policy
which
existed
only
in
the
chicago
region.
he
found
when
he
awarded
over
$100,000
in
attorneys'
fees
that
that
was
using
his
words
"fundamentally
untruthful".
and
then
judge
weinstein
at
page
39a
of
the
appendix
to
the
cert
petition
found
"the
change"
in
the
unlawful
truncation
of
the
regulatory
requirements,
"the
change
was
precipitated
only
after
the
filing
of
this
lawsuit
and
after
a
preliminary
injunction
was
issued
in
the
minnesota
case.
"
suppose...
i
would
like
to
change
the
facts
a
little
bit,
and
suppose
the
secretary
had
simply
announced
publicly
that
claimants
would
not
get
a
complete
evaluation
pursuant
to
what
the
regulations
require
at
the
initial
decisionmaking
stage.
suppose
the
announcement
said
claimants
have
to
go
through
a
truncated
process
at
the
first
stage
in
violation
of
the
regulations
in
order
to
get
a
full
and
fair
hearing,
but
only
to
get
that
in
compliance
with
the
regulations
if
they
appealed
them
to
the
alj.
i
say
rhetorically
would
that
not
be
a
fit
case
for
exhaustion,
for
waiver
of
exhaustion,
but
what
was
done
here
was
worse,
and
even
more
clearly
a
case
for
exhaustion,
because
again
as
the
district
court
found,
the
violation
of
the
regulation
and
the
consequent
deprivation
of
the
right
to
a
meaningful
initial
hearing
was
undisclosed
to
the
claimants
and
the
alj's,
so
it
couldn't
be
corrected
in
the
administrative
process.
as
the
aba
stresses
in
their
quotation
from
some
baseball
figure
in
their
amicus
brief,
this
deprivation,
this
particular
deprivation
could
not
be
cured
in
the
administrative
process
because
you
can't
hit
what
you
can't
see.
not
only
were
claimants
secretly
denied
their
right
to
a
meaningful
initial
hearing
in
compliance
with
the
regulations,
but
in
addition
what
was
done
at
the
initial
stage
was
found
by
judge
weinstein
based
upon
admissions
by
the
government,
by
the
way,
to
have
tainted
the
record
at
the
alj
stage.
the
alj's
were
instructed
by
regulation
to
give
weight
to
the
rfc
findings
by
the
medical
professionals.
the
record
before
the
alj's
purported
to
contain
such
findings
but
of
course
we
now
know
those
findings
were
not
made,
and
as
the
deputy
chief
alj
testified
at
the
trial,
admitted
at
the
trial,
had
they
known
the
truth,
they
would
have
given
no
weight
to
the
rfc
findings
in
the
record.
we
have
a
second
collateral
claim
which
is
perhaps
less
important,
and
i
will
be
briefer
on
it,
the
first
one
being
the
deprivation
of
the
right
given
by
congress
to
a
meaningful
initial
stage
hearing.
the
second
collateral
claim
is
derivative
of
the
first.
in
violation
of
the
statute
and
the
secretary's
regulations,
the
claimants
were
not
told
the
real
basis
why
the
initial
decisionmakers
denied
their
benefits.
this
was
in
flat...
i
would
here
like
to
use
what
was
said
in
mr.
justice
powell's
opinion
in
eldridge
when
he
got
to
the
merits
about
the
assumptions
on
how
the
social
security
review
system
was
meant
to
work,
and
what
was
done
here
by
the
government,
by
the
social
security
administration,
was
in
flat
contradiction
to
what
the
government
had
represented
about
the
administrative
review
system
in
eldridge,
and
i
urge
you
to
review
what
is
said
in
eldridge
at
the
bottom
of
page
345
and
the
top
of
page
346.
i
cannot
pause
to
read
it
all,
but
the
heart
of
the
matter
on
our
second
collateral
issue
was
that
the
agency
was
expected
to
give
its
full
reasoning
and
a
summary
of
the
most
relevant
evidence.
why
was
that
to
be
done?
well,
it
was
stated
in
your
eldridge
opinion
why
it
was
meant
to
be
done,
and
now
quoting.
it
was
done
"to
enable
the
recipient,
the
claimant,
to
mold
his
argument
to
respond
to
the
precise
issues
which
the
decisionmaker
regards
as
crucial.
"
now,
here
no
such
thing
was
done.
and
thus
a
collateral
right
to
a
fair
process
was
in
this
second
way
a
fair
process
in
compliance
with
the
statute
and
in
compliance
with
the
regulations
and
in
compliance
with
what
this
court
said
it
expected
was
denied
to
us.
let
me
turn
in
more
detail
perhaps
to
eldridge
and
ringer.
i
submit
that
this
is,
if
anything,
a
stronger
case
for
waiver
of
full
exhaustion
than
was
eldridge.
there
the
claim
was
that
a
due
process
hearing
was
required
before
disability
benefits
could
be
terminated.
in
concluding
that
exhaustion
after
initial
presentment
of
the
claim
was
not
required,
this
court
said
that
it
would
be
"unrealistic"
to
expect
the
secretary...
by
that
it
means
the
regular
administrative
review
process...
to
change
the
challenged
procedure
or
practice
at
the
behest
of
a
single
aid
recipient.
under
our
facts,
it
was
not
simply
unrealistic,
but
rather
it
was
impossible.
neither
the
claimants
nor
their
advisors
nor
the
subsequent
levels
of
administrative
review
such
as
the
alj's
knew
of
the
challenged
practice
which
deprived
claimants
of
a
meaningful
and
lawful
first
stage
analysis.
similarly,
here
precisely
as
in
eldridge
the
nature
of
the
issue
is
such
that
whatever
happened
in
subsequent
stages
of
administrative
review,
even
if
we
could
have
been
able
to
bring
it
up,
even
if
we
had
known
the
facts,
whatever
happened
in
subsequent
stages
of
administrative
review
could
not
give
the
claimant
the
procedural
right
that
had
been
denied
to
him
or
her.
in
summary,
on
ringer,
although
i
am
going
to
come
back
to
it
in
more
detail,
this
is
a
very
different
case
than
ringer,
among
other
reasons
because
this
is
not
at
bottom...
your
words
in
that
opinion...
a
claim
for
benefits,
and
also
because
what
was
done
in
ringer
was
done
by
the
secretary
within
the
area
of
appropriate
discretion,
of
appropriate
administrative
discretion,
but
i
submit
there
is
no
discretion,
there
is
no
appropriate
discretion
for
a
government
agency
to
issue
a
regulation
promising
to
act
in
one
way
and
then
to
break
that
promise
and
to
do
so
secretly.
in
eldridge,
in
your
opinion
in
eldridge,
the
single
most
important
factor
is
that
the
claim
be
collateral.
eldridge's
claim
was
characterized
by
this
court
as
entirely
collateral.
the
general
principle
in
footnote
11,
which
sets
out
the
general
principle,
the
court
said
that
the
core
principle
of
the
exhaustion
rule
is
that
if
possible
finality
requirements
should
be
construed
so
that
crucial
collateral
claims
not
be
lost
and
potentially
irreparable
injuries
suffered.
the
claims
in
this
case
are
collateral.
they
are
crucial
collateral
claims,
and
if
it
were
necessary
to
show
that
they
are
entirely
collateral,
which
i
believe
it
is
not,
but
if
it
were
necessary,
the
claims
in
this
case
when
properly
described
are
entirely
collateral.
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
um-hm.
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
let
me
tell
you,
i
am
corporation
counsel
for
the
city,
and
i
am
arguing
this
case
by
consensus
among
all
the
parties.
let
me
say
why
we
are
interested
in
the
case,
why
we
joined
it.
i
suppose
most
poignantly
is
the
finding
that
was
made
by
judge
weinstein
that
40
percent
of
the
homeless
people
who
are
now
sleeping
on
the
streets
of
new
york,
increasingly
making
our
city
look
like
calcutta,
are
people
who
were
terminate
from
the...
mentally
disturbed
persons
with
severe
mental
disabilities
who
were
terminated
by
the
social
security
administration
per
this
policy.
so,
we
have
an
interest
in
stopping
this
policy.
now,
we
also
have
a
fiscal
interest.
if
the
judgment
here
is
affirmed,
the
claimants...
by
the
way,
they
don't
automatically
get
benefits.
they
have
to
still
establish
the
right
under
a
fair
proceeding
without
the
tilting
of
the
balance
that
was
improperly
and
secretly
put
in
by
the
secretary.
if
they
prevail,
we
will
be
entitled
to
some
portion
of
the
back
benefits
that
they
receive
to
the
extent
that
the
city
or
the
state
made
good
our
obligation
to
care
for
the
needy,
which
calls
for
us
to
spend
less
money,
and
it
is
far
less
adequate
than
the
federal
benefits
under
the
social
security
administration.
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
that,
of
course,
would
remain
to
be
decided
by
the
district
court
as
a
matter
of
the
remedial
details
of
the
decree.
and
i
don't
think...
there
has
been
no
decision
to
that
effect,
justice
blackmun,
but
i
think
we
would
have
a
claim
upon
those
moneys,
and
the
claimants
would
have
a
claim
on
the
residue,
the
amount
that
is
greater
than
the
moneys
which
were
reimbursed
to
the
claimants
by
the
city.
but
as
i
say,
that
has
not
been
resolved
in
a
case,
and
first
and
foremost,
our
interest
is
that
our
people
not
be
thrown
out
of
a
government
program
and
as
was
found
by
judge
weinstein
thrown
out
on
the
streets
to
their
detriment
and
to
the
general
population's
detriment.
now,
i
was
saying
that
if
we
had
to,
and
i
don't
think
we
do,
but
if
we
had
to,
i
believe
we
can
show
properly
construed,
properly
understood,
properly
articulate
that
the
claim
in
this
case
is
entirely
collateral.
why?
because
the
result
of
the
secretary's
actions
here
was
to
deny
altogether
the
claimant's
right
to
a
fair
or
meaningful
assessment
of
their
claims
at
the
initial
evaluation
stage.
seeking
to
vindicate
this
right
was
or
is
in
the
relevant
sense
entirely
collateral
to
their
claim
for
benefits,
and
as
in
eldridge,
precisely
as
in
eldridge,
this
right
could
not
be
vindicated
by
subsequent
layers
of
administrative
review.
eldridge
also
calls
upon
the
court
to
consider
the
"consequences"
of
deferred
administrative
review
or
similarly
"claimant's
interest
in
having
a
particular
issue
resolved
promptly.
"
that
has
to
be
looked
at
along
with
collaterality.
here,
just
as
in
eldridge,
to
defer
is
to
deny
the
right
which
we
seek
to
vindicate.
to
force
claimants
to
a
second
stage
hearing
before
they
receive
their
first
fair
evaluation
in
compliance
with
the
regulations
is
to
deny
forever
the
right
they
sought
to
vindicate
in
the
first
place.
it
was
enough
for
mr.
eldridge
that
he
made
a
colorable
claim
that
an
erroneous
termination
would
damage
him
in
a
way
not
recompensable
through
retroactive
payments.
here
again,
if
anything,
our
case
is
stronger
on
the
point
than
was
eldridge's.
the
harm
here
is
not
just
a
claim
of
damage
or
a
colorable
assertion.
here
there
were
explicit
actual
uncontested
findings
that
this
class
of
mentally
disturbed
claimants
was
devastating,
some
even
becoming
suicidal,
some
indeed
committing
suicide
by
the
improper
denials,
and
there
were
uncontested
findings
that
because
of
their
condition,
their
mentally
disturbed
condition,
they
were
particularly
likely
to
be
deterred
from
pursuing
their
claim
further
through
the
administrative
appeal
process
by
the
crushing
news
of
the
denial,
and
of
course
if
they
did
pursue
it
further,
as
judge
weinstein
found,
even
though
some
of
them
would
win,
there
was
nonetheless
a
taint
to
the
record
that
went
to
the
alj's.
to
insist
on
exhaustion
here
would
not
only
be
inconsistent
in
principle
with
the
legal
claims
we
raise.
it
would
also
in
practice
insulate
from
any
remedy
a
policy
that
caused
real
injuries
to
thousands
of
mentally
ill
persons,
and
none
of
the
benefits
that
can
be
achieved
from
exhaustion
as
defined
in
salfi,
as
earlier
articulated
in
mccart,
could
have
been
achieved
in
this
case
through
further
exhaustion.
so,
with
no
benefits
from
exhaustion,
with
substantial
and
irreparable
injury
from
exhaustion,
and
with
a
crucial
collateral
issue,
we
squarely
fit
the
eldridge
standard.
and
nothing
which
you
said
in
ringer
changes
this
analysis.
first,
ringer
was
recognized
as
being
at
bottom
a
claim
for
benefits,
and
that
is
laid
out
at
some
length.
but
here,
another
point
about
ringer
and
the
issues,
the
holding
by
the
secretary
there
or
the
statement
by
the
secretary
that
bcbr
surgery
was
not
reimbursable
is
a
kind
of
matter
which,
as
this
court
said,
is
clearly
discretionary
clearly
within
the
discretion
of
the
secretary
to
decide
whether
a
particular
medical
procedure
is
reasonable
and
necessary
under
the
act.
it
is
not
within
the
discretion
of
the
secretary
or
any
other
government
official
to
secretly
violate
their
own
regulations
and
deprive
people
of
their
rights
in
that
fashion.
it
is
not
normal
and
within
the
administrative
power
to
say
that
claimants
will
not
be
given
a
meaningful
first
stage
evaluation,
and
to
do
so
secretly,
and
i
stress
again
that
in
ringer
it
was
an
appropriate
medical
judgment
that
was
made.
here,
the
medical
judgment
had
been
made
in
the
regulations
as
to
what
has
happened,
meant
to
happen.
there
were
meant
to
be
five
stages.
they
truncated
it
after
three.
who
was
to
do
it?
the
doctors
were
to
evaluate
it.
they
ignored
the
opinions
of
the
doctors
as
found
repeatedly
by
judge
weinstein.
it
is
perhaps
helpful
again
for
me
to
compare...
to
illustrate
the
extent
of
the
government's
misconduct
and
its
departure
from
both
the
letter
and
the
spirit
of
the
statutory
scheme.
i
would
like
again
to
illustrate
that
by
comparing
what
was
found
to
have
been
actually
done
in
this
case
with
what
this
court
assumed
was
the
practice
in
your
richardson
v.
perales
opinion,
and
in
your
eldridge
opinion.
in
richardson,
it
was
stated,
in
holding
that
the
written
report
of
doctors
could
be
relied
upon
in
these
kinds
of
hearings,
it
was
stated
that
disabilities
decisions
turn
on,
quoting
from
your
opinion,
"routine
standard
and
unbiased
medical
reports
of
physician
specialists.
"
the
same
quote
was
repeated
when
you
got
to
the
merits
in
eldridge.
but
here,
in
contrast
to
that
expectation,
and
as
found
by
the
district
court,
the
professional
opinions
of
physicians
that
claimants
could
not
work
were
consistently
overridden
and
disregarded.
there
is
a
lot
more
both
in
richardson
to
a
great
extent
and
in
eldridge
also
describing
how
this
system
is
meant
to
work,
which
is
utterly
disregarded
by
what
happened
here.
it
is
meant
to
be
nonadversarial.
it
is
meant
to
be
open
all
fair.
it
is
not
meant
to
be
something
where
a
secret
rule
is
imposed
in
violation
of
the
regulations.
the
government
tries
here
to
reargue
the
facts.
the
first
point
is
that
these
are
curious
arguments
to
make
in
this
court.
the
district
court
found
that
the
policy
was
secret,
was
illegal,
was
uniformly
imposed,
was
not
discovered
until
after
this
case
was
brought,
and
it
was
imposed
upon
physicians
whose
professional
judgment
differed.
the
district
court
found
that
this
was
imposed
by
high
level
officials
of
the
social
security
administration.
the
government
chose
not
to
appeal
a
single
one
of
those
findings.
they
were
confirmed
by
the
second
circuit.
they
were
made
also
in
the--
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
--that
is
a
good
point.
the
second
circuit
wrote
those
same
things
and
assumed
them
to
be
true,
the
government
not
having
confirmed
them.
i
think
that
is
a
fair...
not
having
appealed
them.
that
is
a
fair
point.
but
i
still
take
pleasure
from
the
fact
the
second
circuit
articulated
that
they
were
the
facts
as
they
are
the
facts.
and
again,
the
opinion
by
judge
larsen
on
attorneys'
fees
which
we
mentioned
is
relevant,
is
hopeful,
is
helpful,
is
showing
that
the
defense
on
the
merits
tried
in
the
district
courts
was
not
in
good
faith.
that
is
why
he
awarded
attorneys'
fees.
on
60
days...
let
me
just
give
the
briefest
of
points.
i
rely
on
our
brief
for
the
point
that
this
is
a
statute
of
limitations
as
this
court
has
twice
before
said.
i
rely
on
the
brief
for
the
point
that
even
if
this
is
jurisdictional,
the
time
never
started
to
run
because
the
true
reasons
for
the
decision
were
not
given
to
the
claimants.
if
we
win
on
exhaustion,
it
doesn't
make
sense,
i
submit,
to
go
against
us
on
60
days.
the
same
bad
faith,
the
same
clandestine
policy
which
excuses,
which
contributes
to
the
excusing
of
the
further
administrative
review
causes
this
statute
to
be
told.
now,
there
is
a
lot
of
discussion...
justice
rehnquist,
you
made
the
point
about
when
the
government
is
involved,
shouldn't
you
turn
square
corners?
true.
one
has
to
pay...
first,
of
course,
they
cut
the
corner
here,
but
one
has
to
pay
attention
to
what
kind
of
tolling
you
are
talking
about.
tolling,
as
was
argued,
for
example,
in
soriano,
for
war
is
something
which
the
court
in
soriano
quite
correctly
said
you
do
not
assume,
particularly
against
the
government
unless
it
has
been
specifically
included
in
the
statute.
but
tolling
for
misconduct
of
the
sort
that
was
involved
here
is
something
which
the
general
statements
of
this
court
starting
in
1874
in
bailey
against
glover
say
is,
under
the
common
law
of
england
and
the
united
states
is
assumed,
and
which
this
court
in
1947
in
homeburg,
quoting
bailey
against
glover,
said
that
this
equitable
doctrine
is
read
into
every
federal
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
it
was
not.
it
was
not,
your
honor,
but
i
would
submit
that
the
government
of
all
parties
should
not
be
allowed
to
give
inaccurate
reasons--
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
--on
this
particular
wrongdoing
estoppel
or
tolling,
which
i
think
is
the
right
label
to
use,
should
apply.
the
nature
of
the
wrongdoing
is
important
to
consider
in
deciding
whether...
what
it
means
to
say
square
corners
should
be
followed
when
you
are
litigating
against
the
government.
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
he
got
it
from
testimony
from
some
witnesses
who
worked
for
the
government,
and
as
to
which--
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
--i
think
there
was
survey
done,
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
if
it
is
too
relevant,
i
am
not
going
to
get
my
last
point
in.
i
might
want
to
do
that.
0
[generallaughter.]
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
let
me
just
conclude
with
a
couple
of
points.
they
say
the
sky
will
fall
if
you
affirm.
they
say
the
consequences
to
the
vast
social
security
administration
will
be
harmful.
well,
it
won't
unless
the
government
is
reserving
the
right
to
once
again
systematically
and
secretly
ignore
their
own
regulations.
actually,
i
am
glad
they
raised
the
subject,
because
the
consequence
of
accepting
the
government's
position,
will
be
to
flood
the
administrative
system
with
more
cases,
and
to
flood
the
courts
with
more
cases,
because
if
the
rule,
as
the
government
argues,
is
that
they
can
secretly
violate
someone's
rights,
and
then
the
person
who
didn't
know
what
was
done
to
them
has
lost
their
chance
to
go
to
court,
well,
everybody...
it
would
be
malpractice
for
lawyers
not
always
to
go
to
court.
they
would
go
to
court,
like
mr.
macawber,
hoping
that
something
will
turn
up.
so,
they
have
the
consequences
upside-down.
finally,
on
congressional
intent,
the
government
speaks
passionately
about
congressional
intent.
of
course,
that
begs
the
question.
here,
as
in
eldridge,
the
issue
at
bottom
is
what
is
that
intent.
let
me
ask
the
question
rhetorically.
why
would
congress
want
to
require
a
vulnerable
class
of
mentally
impaired
persons
to
have
to
take
further
administrative
appeals
when
those
appeals
could
not
possibly
right
the
systematic
wrong,
the
systemic
wrong
that
had
been
done
to
them?
