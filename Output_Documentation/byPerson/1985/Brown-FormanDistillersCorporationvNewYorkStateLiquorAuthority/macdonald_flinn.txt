mr.
macdonald
flinn
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
judgment
by
the
new
york
state
court
of
appeals.
that
court
held
that
the
lowest
price
liquor
affirmation
requirement
of
new
york's
alcoholic
beverage
control
law
does
not
violate
the
commerce
clause
of
the
u.s.
constitution.
on
this
appeal,
brown-forman
argued
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
upon
its
face
because
its
necessary
effect
is
the
extraterritorial
regulation
by
new
york
of
liquor
prices
in
other
states.
new
york
effectively
sets
the
minimum
price
for
liquor
sales
in
every
state
in
the
union.
the
new
york
statute--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
--yes,
justice
white,
that
is
correct.
the
statute
works
this
way.
last
tuesday,
for
example--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
--new
york
does
not
set
the
price.
that
is
conceded,
justice
white.
the
supplier
initially
determines
his
own
price
for
each
brand
which
he
offers
for
sale
to
new
york
suppliers.
it
is
at
that
point
that
the
new
york
statute
reaches
in
and
obligates
him,
mandates
that
he
not
for
an
extended
period
of
time,
the
posting
period,
charge
any
lower
price
in
any
other
state,
having
filed
that
price
in
new
york.
the
statute
works
this
way.
on
the
25th
of
every
month,
every
supplier
must
file
or
post
a
schedule
of
prices
to
be
charged
for
all
of
us
products
sold
to
new
york
wholesalers
during
the
next
following
month.
last
tuesday,
all
suppliers
had
to
file
an
affirmation
and
a
schedule
of
prices.
it
would
cover
all
of
their
sales
for
the
month
of
april
of
this
year.
all
sales
to
new
york
wholesalers
must
be
at
those
explicit
posted
prices,
neither
higher
nor
lower.
the
statute
also
prohibits
the
price
discrimination
or
difference
in
prices
charged
to
one
new
york
wholesaler
as
compared
with
other
new
york
wholesalers.
finally,
as
a
condition
of
the
right
to
sell
to
new
york
wholesalers,
the
new
york
statute,
as
justice
white
indicated,
obligates
every
supplier
to
adhere
to
that
price
once
posted
in
new
york
during
the
entire
calendar
month
that
is
covered
by
the
posting
requirement.
every
month
every
supplier
must
go
through
this
affirmation
process
again.
the
language
of
the
statute
and
the
affirmation
or
verification
form
employed
by
the
state
liquor
authority
are
essentially
in
the
same
identical
language.
if
the
court
will
indulge
me
for
a
moment,
i
would
like
to
read
the
explicit
salient
provisions
of
the
statute.
it
required
that
the
new
york
posted
price
must
be
no
higher
than
the
lowest
price
at
which
each
item
of
liquor
will
be
sold
anywhere
in
any
other
state
at
any
time
during
the
calendar
month
for
which
such
schedule
shall
be
in
effect.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
it
is
in
just
that
form,
justice
white.
an
affirmation
in
the
form
of
a
sworn
affidavit
is
required
of
every
supplier--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
--the
penalties
cover
a
variety
of
alternatives,
from
a
criminal
misdemeanor
sanction
all
the
way
to
a
revocation
or
a
suspension
of
the
license.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
they
charge
you
with
having
falsely
affirmed
and
violated
the
provisions
of
the
statute.
focusing
upon
this
particular
case,
justice
white,
while
the
facts
were
not
a
direct
reduction
of
brown-forman's
price
in
any
other
state,
but
rather
a
challenge
by
the
state
liquor
authority
of
certain
lump
sum
allowances--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
--which
were
paid,
a
license
revocation
proceeding
was
instituted
by
the
state
liquor
authority
against
brown-forman.
an
administrative
hearing
was
held.
a
determination
was
made
by
the
authority's
hearing
officer
and
was
affirmed
by
the
authority.
from
that
administrative
determination,
brown-forman
took
recourse
to
appellate
review.
the
first
court
authorized
to
hear
the
case
was
the
appellate
division
of
the
new
york
state
supreme
court.
in
this
proceeding,
brown-forman
was
in
effect
fined
$40,000,
forfeiture
against
the
bond
that
all
suppliers
must
post
with
the
state,
and
its
license,
two
licenses
in
the
state
of
new
york
were
suspended
for
ten
days'
period,
stayed
subject
to
brown-forman's
convincing
the
authority
over
the
course
of
the
next
year
that
it
was
no
longer
in
violation
of
the
affirmation
requirement.
that
is
why
we
are
here
today,
justice
white.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
we
might
have
some
additional
arguments,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
do
not
believe,
with
all
due
respect,
that
the
severity
of
the
sanctions
necessarily
bears
upon
whether
this
is
the
kind
of
extraterritorial
regulation
of
prices
which
the
court
has
held
is
the
kind
of
direct
burden
that
automatically
violates
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
it
could
well
be,
your
honor,
and
there
could
be
in
addition
certain
due
process
claims.
our
administrative
agency,
the
liquor
authority,
is
constantly
hailed
before
our
state
courts
in
new
york
in
terms
of
the
severity
or
the
reasonable
connection
of
the
relief
that
it
finds
in
administrative
proceedings
involving
license
revocation
or
suspension
proceedings.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
we
have
not
convinced
them,
your
honor.
i
think
they
have
noblesse
oblige
given
us
time
to
pursue
our
appeal.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
the
lump
sum
allowances,
to
my
knowledge,
justice
white,
are
still
being
given
by
brown-forman.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
we
offered
to
do
that,
and
the
state
liquor
authority,
and
frankly,
we
cannot
find
fault
with
the
liquor
authority's
determination
on
this
issue,
said
that
another
section
of
the
same
chapter--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
--that
is
right,
and
unfortunately,
this
court
has
allowed
us
to
argue
in
plenary
argument
only
the
facial
challenge
to
the
new
york
statute.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
i
am
not
asking
that
you
overrule
seagram.
i
believe--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
--i
believe,
sir,
that
i
can.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
i
believe
that
there
is,
justice
blackmun.
basically,
as
the
court
knows,
in
seagram
against
hostetter,
this
court
rejected
a
purely
facial
challenge
to
the
original
new
york
affirmation
statute.
that
statute,
however,
was
an
entirely
different
statute,
because
as
you
have
indicated,
it
had
a
retrospective
or
historic
time
frame,
not
prospective.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
all
right.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
i
think
there
are
pragmatic
reasons
why
new
york
will
not
go
back
to
a
retrospective
statute,
but
let
me
try
to
satisfy
and
answer
your
question.
the
original
new
york
statute
in
essence
said
to
suppliers,
you
cannot
charge
prices
to
new
york
wholesalers
this
month
which
are
any
higher
than
the
lowest
price
that
you
charged
anywhere
else
two
months
ago.
now,
what
are
the
implications
of
that?
first,
unlike
the
present
prospective
statute
that
requires
a
commitment,
a
promise,
an
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
supplier
as
to
tying
his
hands
every
place
else
for
a
successive
month,
the
original
statute
merely
reflected
prices
that
had
in
fact
already
been
charged
elsewhere
in
the
past.
there
was
therefore
no
reaching
out
and
prospectively
putting
suppliers
into
a
straightjacket
so
far
as
their
freedom
to
charge
whatever
prices,
to
lower
whatever
prices
midmonth
they
might
choose
to
or
be
compelled
by
the
exigencies
of
competition
to
do
in
any
other
state.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
justice
o'connor,
clearly
you
are
right.
even
with
the
retrospective
statute
of
the
type
that
new
york
originally
adopted,
a
supplier
knows
full
well
that
the
price
he
charges
in
illinois
this
month
is
going
to
be
a
limit
upon
the
price
that
he
can
charge
in
new
york
two
months
later.
now,
i
think
this
court
fully
focused
upon
that
fact
when
it
decided
seagram
against
hostetter.
the
majority
opinion
in
seagram
against
hostetter--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
--beg
pardon?
mr.
macdonald
flinn
yes,
sir,
it
was.
i
believe
there
was
an
absention,
but
the
opinion
of
the
court
was
unanimous.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
your
honor,
i
am...
justice
blackmun,
i
fall
back
on
the
traditional
plaintive
cry
of
counsel
before
this
court.
that
is
not
my
case.
you
do
not
need
to
decide
it
in
my
favor
for
my
client
to
prevail.
i
am
here
in
the
hopes
that
my
client
will
prevail
and
be
able
to
mend
its
ship
with
the
state
liquor
authority
in
new
york.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
the
answer
clearly
is
that
i
believe
that
had
seagram
v.
hostetter
been
decided
at
a
time
when
there
was
more
than
a
single
retrospective
statute,
the
result
conceivably
could
have
been
different.
i
am
not
urging
that
seagram
v.
hostetter
be
overruled,
and
i
urge
instead
it
need
not
be
overruled
in
order
to
decide
for
brown-forman
on
this
appeal.
the
basis
for
a
different
result
in
seagram
v.
hostetter
today,
even
on
a
facial
challenge,
would
be
this.
where
you
have
more
than
one
retrospective
affirmation
requirement,
or
where
you
have
at
least
one
retrospective
affirmation
requirement,
and
any
number
of
either
prospective
or
simultaneous
contemporary
affirmation
requirements,
there
is
inevitably
a
block
upon
the
ability
of
suppliers
to
raise
their
prices
in
any
state.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
for
a
month.
the
alternative,
justice
white,
is
to
stop
selling.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
i
submit,
justice
white,
that
it
is
something
more
than
that.
first
of
all--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
--in
this
case,
justice
white,
that
argument
has
been
made
by
new
york
for
the
first
time
before
this
court.
that
argument
was
not
made
before
either
the
appellate
division
or
the
new
york
state--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
--it
is
in
the
statute,
and
i
would
like
to
address
it,
justice
white.
basically,
the
language
to
which
new
york
points
says
that
upon
the
prior
written
permission
of
the
state
liquor
authority
granted
for
good
cause
showing,
and
for
purposes
not
inconsistent
with
the
statute,
a
deviation
in
the
prices
charged
to
new
york
wholesalers
can
be
made
as
compared
with
the
previously
posted
price.
the
argument
that
new
york
makes
here
today
is
that
you
can
run
to
the
state
liquor
authority,
you
can
obtain
this
prior
written
permission,
and
they
will
let
you
reduce
your
price
in
new
york
in
order
to
allow
you
to
reduce
your
price
in
some
other
state.
let's
look
at
that.
no
indication
is
offered
that
the
state
liquor
authority
has
ever
done
that.
no
state
court,
including
the
new
york
state
court
of
appeals--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
--a
very
good
point,
justice
stevens.
not
all
of
the
affirmation
states
have
posting
requirements.
that
is
significant,
because
a
posting
requirement
can
make
even
a
contemporary
current
or
simultaneous
affirmation
requirement
have
the
same
kind
of
extraterritorial
reaching
out
and
locking
in
of
prices
to
be
charged
in
other
states.
i
believe
that
the
amicus
wine
and
spirits
wholesale
institute
brief
indicates
that
in
addition
to
new
york
there
are
maybe
eleven
other
affirmation
states
which
have
a
posting
requirement.
getting
back
to
the
question
of
the
good
cause
language
in
the
statute,
no
new
york
state
court,
including
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
has
ever
endorsed
or
subscribed
to
this
argument.
secondly,
this
kind
of
argument,
we
believe,
runs
directly
counter,
is
antagonistic
to
the
strong,
long-standing
policy
of
new
york
state,
a
policy
which
dates
back
to
1942
that
there
shall
be
no
discrimination
in
price,
no
difference
in
the
prices
charged
between
different
new
york
wholesalers.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
let
me
speak
to
that,
justice
white.
i
mean
no
disparagement
of
our
state
liquor
authority,
but
as
is
frequently
the
case
with
administrative
agencies,
its
record
for
alacrity
is
not
sterling.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
the
very--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
--the
interesting
thing
is,
they
might
not,
justice
white.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
may
i
suggest
why
they
might
not
be?
the
posting
requirement,
which
was
adopted
long
before
affirmation
ever
became
a
policy
of
new
york
or
any
other
state,
was
designed
to
prevent
in-state
price
discrimination.
the
posting
requirement
is
to
ensure
that
during
the
30-day
period
covered
by
the
posting
of
prices,
a
wholesaler
who
purchases
later
in
the
month
will
not
gain
a
monetary
or
competitive
advantage
vis-a-vis
a
new
york
wholesaler
who
has
purchased
earlier
in
the
month.
consequently,
with
all
due
respect,
i
am
not
so
certain
that
the
state
liquor
authority
would
adopt
the
argument
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
new
york.
i
am
similarly
quite
concerned
that
new
york
state
would
not
adopt
that,
state
courts
would
not
adopt
that
argument.
but
i
think
that
the
argument
in
itself
is
revealing.
the
argument
in
essence
clearly
demonstrates
that
new
york
unabashedly
controls
by
reaching
out
and
putting
a
lock
upon
the
minimum
prices
that
can
be
charged
everywhere
else,
says
in
apology,
oh,
but
you
can
get
around
that
by
seeking
and
obtaining
the
prior
written
permission
of
our
state
liquor
authority.
by
prevailing
upon
their
discretion,
you
then
become
free
for
the
first
time
to
sell
at
prices
lower
than
those
posted
here
in
new
york.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
there
are
a
few.
clearly,
new
york,
in
view
of
its
size
and
its
importance,
probably
has
as
broad
if
not
the
broadest
representation
of
distiller
brands
of
any
state
in
the
union.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
that
is
perhaps
an
overstatement,
but
clearly
there
is
truth
to
the
point
you
are
making,
justice--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
--there
are
some
distillers
who
do
not
sell
in
new
york.
there
are
regional
distillers.
there
are
regional
rectifiers.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
in
some
states,
brown-forman
competes
with
one
or
more
other
suppliers,
whether
distillers
of
brown
goods,
rectifiers
of
white
goods
or
not,
who
are
purely
regional.
i
can
give
you
an
example.
new
york
city
has
had
tremendous
attrition
in
the
number
of
wholesalers.
there
are
five
major
superlarge
wholesalers
that
serve
the
metropolitan
new
york
area.
two
of
those
wholesalers
have
their
own
private
captive
brands.
they
actually
rectify
their
own
gin,
their
own
vodka.
they
are
very
successful,
effective
forces
in
the
metropolitan
marketplace.
as
long
as
they
choose
not
to
sell
in
other
states,
they
have
a
degree
of
freedom,
if
you
will,
from
the
affirmation
concept,
and
responsive
to
your
question,
there
is
therefore
an
arguable
problem
on
the
part
of
brown-forman
and
other
national
suppliers
in
terms
of
their
ability
to
make
the
instant
momentary
response
price
initiatives
taken
by
that
purely
statewide
or
in
some
instances
a
purely
regional
supplier.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
the
record
does
not
tell
us.
the
record
was
not
put
together
to
answer
that
question,
justice
stevens,
but
let
me
take
issue
with
that
part
of
your
question
which
says
that
most
of
the
states
have
posting
requirements.
that
is
not
true.
approximately
a
dozen
states,
which
means
we
have
got
38--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
--the
question,
it
seems
to
me,
has
to
turn
on
this
result.
there
are
now
20
other
states
which
probably
predictably,
following
new
york's
lead
after
this
court's
decision
in
seagram
v.
hostetter,
now
have
affirmation
statutes.
the
result
by
the
very
definition
of
the
affirmation
concept
is
that
the
minimum
price
in
all
of
those
states
is
also
the
maximum
price.
there
is
a
single
price.
affirmation
has
been
on
the
books
in
new
york
dating
back
to
1964.
it
first
became
effective
after
the
court's
decision
here
in
1966.
in
that
roughly
20-year
period,
these
other
states
have
come
in.
you
now
have
a
multi-state
affirmation
requirement.
that
alone,
apart
from
posting
requirements,
has
injected
a
rigidity,
a
nonflexibility,
indeed,
an
absolute
uniformity
of
price
into
all
of
those
21
affirmation
states.
but
it
has,
if
you
will,
slopped
over
and
produced
essentially
the
same
prices
in
many
other
states.
it
is
that
fact
of
this
industry,
justice
stevens,
that
i
think
explains
why
my
answer
to
your
question
has
to
be
probably
there
has
been
very
little
midmonth
price
reduction.
now,
let
me
speak
candidly.
i
am
not
sure
that
brown-forman's
position
is
representative
of
the
views
or
attitudes
of
all
the
suppliers.
candidly,
affirmation
has
created
a
nice
live
and
let
live
kind
of
competitive
ease.
there
are
undoubtedly
some
suppliers
who
relish
the
fact
that
they
no
longer
have
to
make
price
decisions
responsive
to
the
unique
competitive
forces
of
each
local
marketplace.
there
are
undoubtedly
suppliers
who
are
happy
that
state
managers
no
longer
have
to
be
given
that
kind
of
pricing
freedom
to
respond
to
the
competitive
exigencies
of
their
particular
marketplace.
there
are,
on
the
other
hand,
suppliers,
and
brown-forman
is
one
of
those,
who
believe
that
a
competitive
environment
in
which
parties
could
and
had
to
respond
to
competitive
initiatives
would
produce
a
more
rational,
sound
pricing
situation.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
i
would
answer
your
question.
i
would
point
out,
however,
the
moreland
act
commission
record
was
before
this
court
in
seagram
against
hostetter.
it
is
interesting.
it
is
ironic.
the
moreland
act
commission
never
said
that
the
alleged
overcharging
or
higher
retail
prices
to
consumers
in
new
york
which
it
found
was
attributable
to
any
discrimination
in
the
supplier's
prices
to
new
york
wholesalers
as
compared
with
their
prices
to
wholesalers
elsewhere.
the
moreland
act
commission
laid
the
blame
on
new
york
for
having
adopted
a
mandatory
state-enforced
fair
trade
resale
price
maintenance
structure,
which
in
essence
controlled
the
prices
from
the
retailer
to
the
consumer.
be
that
as
it
may,
when
the
state
legislature
adopted
affirmation,
it
did
so
on
the
ground
that
it
was
going
to,
and
it
was
very
politically
popular,
i
can
assure
you,
justice
rehnquist,
it
was
going
to
assure
all
new
york
voters
and
consumers
that
their
wholesalers
would
not
be
paying
higher
prices
than
wholesalers
anywhere
else.
now,
what
can
new
york
do
today?
if
the
court
agrees
with
us
that
this
prospective
type
of
statute
which
is
now
the
typical
affirmation
statute
in
all
of
those
states
having
affirmation,
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
because
it
extraterritorially
regulates
prices
elsewhere.
i
believe
that
essentially
the
only
course
available
to
new
york
if
it
wishes
to
have
a
statute
that
will
withstand
constitutional
muster
on
its
face
is
to
go
the
concurrent
or
current
price
affirmation
time
reference,
and
even
then
new
york,
i
believe,
has
to
be
exceedingly
careful.
new
york,
because
of
this
non-discrimination
in
price
among
different
new
york
wholesalers
policy
is
going
to
have
to
face
up
to
the
fact
that
the
posting
requirement
is
fundamentally
inconsistent
with
even
a
contemporaneous,
truly
current
price
affirmation
standard,
because
the
posting
ties
suppliers'
hands,
not
only
for
the
30-day
or
calendar
period,
whatever
the
period
may
be,
so
far
as
their
sales
pricing
to
new
york
wholesalers,
but
by
the
very
definition
of
affirmation
does
so
in
their
sales
to
every
other
state.
now,
whether
new
york
is
well
advised
in
following
that
policy,
i
think,
is
open
to
question.
it
is
obviously
not
a
question
for
me,
not
a
question,
with
all
due
respect,
for
this
court.
but
ironically,
new
york,
in
view
of
its
size
and
importance,
the
volume
purchases
and
efficiencies
of
its
wholesalers,
probably
has
its
consumers
more
penalized
by
the
affirmation
concept
than
most
any
other
state.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
i
think,
justice
white,
that
would
be
the
case
that
i
would
have
to
come
to
you
with
a
record
and
not
a
purely
facial
challenge.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
thank
you.
i
appreciate
the
accolade
for
perseverance.
i
don't
know
whether
my
client
would
have
me
back.
perhaps
some
more
successful
advocate.
basically,
the
kind
of
contemporary
time
reference
that
i
think
is
essential
is
one
that
probably
could
not
be
accompanied
by
a
posting
requirement
for
any
specified
period
of
time.
it
has
to
be
an
affirmation
requirement
which
not
only
recognizes
that
new
york
has
no
right
to
interfere
with
future
pricing
decisions
by
suppliers
in
other
states,
but
makes
it
clear
that
it
does
not
interfere
with
them.
it
in
essence
says,
look,
you
are
free
to
lower
your
prices
in
any
other
state
at
any
time
as
long
as
you
simultaneously
reduce
your
prices
here.
now,
i
believe
that
kind
of
statute
would
pass
facial
muster.
there
is
substance,
justice
white,
to
your
question,
and
i
did
not
complete
my
answer
to
justice
blackmun
as
to
whether
seagram
v.
hostetter
might
have
been
decided
differently
if
this
court
had
been
aware,
and
it
was
not
brought
to
the
court's
attention
by
the
parties
who
briefed
that
case
that
there
would
be
more
than
a
single
retrospective
statute.
there
would
be,
therefore,
this
necessity
to
stop
selling
in
one
or
more
states
in
order
to
comply
with
the
current
or
contemporaneous
or
prospective
price
affirmation
requirements
of
other
states.
i
believe,
if
i
read
the
court's
decisions
on
extraterritoriality,
that
kind
of
interference
with
an
interstate
business
outside
of
the
regulating
state,
which
in
effect
requires
the
supplier
to
stop
sales
there
in
order
to
comply
with
the
conditions
of
selling
in
the
regulating
state
is
probably
that
kind
of
direct
burden
upon
interstate
commerce
which,
had
the
court
viewed
seagram
v.
hostetter
in
that
light,
might
well
have
produced
a
different
decision
there.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
may
save
what
small
time
i
have
left.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
very
brief,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
make
simply
this
point.
if
the
court
agreed
with
us
that
new
york's
present
statute
prospectively
reaches
out
and
controls
minimum
prices
that
can
be
charged
in
other
states,
there
is
no
necessity
to
show
what
has
in
fact
happened,
whether
prices
have
been
raised
in
other
states
while
lowered
in
new
york.
there
is
no
necessity
to
show
the
competitive
arguments
which
we
make
because
we
believe
that
they
inevitably
flow
from
such
extraterritorial
regulation.
to
the
contrary,
if
there
is
such
an
extraterritorial
projection
by
new
york
of
its
legislation,
its
minimum
prizes
elsewhere,
that
is
a
direct
burden
upon
interstate
commerce,
and
no
further
showing
is
necessary.
as
justice
white
wrote
in
might
against
edgar,
where
a
state
projects
its
legislation
outside
its
borders
and
attempts
to
regulate
transactions
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
state,
there
is
nothing
to
be
weighed
in
the
balance
to
sustain
the
regulating
state's
act.
