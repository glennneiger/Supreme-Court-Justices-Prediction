blackmun
i
am
interested.
are
you
asking
that
we
overrule
seagram?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
can
you
distinguish
seagram
from
this
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
there
a
difference
as
a
practical
matter
between
a
retrospective
statute
and
a
prospective
one?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
raise
the
question
whether
it
is
an
entirely
different
one.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
if
you
prevail
here,
new
york
might
well
go
back
to
the
old
statute,
and
you
will
be
up
here
again.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
thought
it
was
unanimous,
wasn't
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
thought
it
was
unanimous.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
the
court
might
have
been
wrong.
you
wouldn't
object
to
our
overruling
it,
would
you?
