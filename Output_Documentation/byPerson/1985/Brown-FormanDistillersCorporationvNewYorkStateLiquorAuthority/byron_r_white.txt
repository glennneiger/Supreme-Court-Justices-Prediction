justice
byron
r.
white
it
does
it
by
setting
the...
by
requiring
the
filing
of
prices
in
new
york
and
telling
them
not
to
vary,
telling
them
it
can't
be...
it
can't
be
higher
than
any
place
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
really
doesn't
say
what
the
prices
have
to
be
in
some
other
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
is
really
a
promise?
when
you
file,
you
promise
now
to
lower
your
prices
in
any
other
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
penalty
if,
contrary
to
the
affirmation,
some
company
lowers
its
price
in
another
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
the
charge
be
if
a
company,
after
making
its
affirmation
in
new
york,
lowers
the
price
in
new
jersey,
and
new
york
finds
out
about
it?
what
would
they
charge
you
with?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
--how
did
you
convince
the
authorities
that
you
wouldn't
be
violating
the
affirmation
in
the
future?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
still
going
on
with
your
promotion
allowances
in
other
states,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wanted
to
give
them
to
somebody
in
new
york,
too,
but
they
wouldn't
permit
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
is
just
plainly
forbidden
under
the
new
york
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
--for
a
month.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
maybe
the
real
limit
is
how
long
it
takes
the
new
york
liquor
authority
to
decide
to
permit
you
to
change
your
price
in
new
york.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
there
a
provision
that
you
could
decide
you
wanted
to
lower
your
price
in
some
other
state,
and
so
you
lower
the
price
in
new
york,
and
so
you
ask
the
authority,
may
i
lower
the
price
of
this--
justice
byron
r.
white
--yes,
but
it
is
in
the
statute,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
sounds
awfully
sensible
to
say...
say
you
posted
this
price,
and
said,
these
are
going
to
be
the
prices
for
the
next
month,
and
you
know
you
can't
charge
less
than
any
other
state,
but
you
go
up
and
say,
we
would
like
to
amend
our
filing
for
the
rest
of
this
month,
and
believe
it
or
not,
we
are
going
to
drop
our
prices
here
and
everywhere
else.
now,
do
you
suppose
you
would
have
much
trouble
selling
that
to
the
liquor
authority?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
may
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
they
were
going
to
be
fast
at
anything,
i
would
think
they
would
be
fast
at
this
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
lowering
the
price
of
whiskey?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
there
are
some
distillers
that
don't
sell
in
new
york?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
any
distiller
that
doesn't
sell
in
new
york
that
you
are
competing
with
in
other
states,
you
really
can't
compete
with
them
if
they
undersell
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there
are
any
distillers
who
don't
sell
in
new
york.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
people
at
brown-forman
are
competing
with,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
moving
to
a
strictly
current
affirmation
approach,
i
would
suppose
you
would
still
be
arguing
that
new
york
is
affecting
the
prices
in
other
states.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
there
is
a
distiller
in
the
midwest,
and
he
is
selling
in
new
york,
and
be...
at
his
posted
prices,
if
he
wants
to,
he
cannot
lower
the
prices
for
his
liquor
that
he
is
sending
out
to
california
for
a
month.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
what
is
all
the
big
argument
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
get
it
straight.
in
new
york
you
post
your
prices,
and
that
is
the
price
you
are
supposed
to
sell
at
in
new
york
for
a
month.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
price
you
charge
in
new
york
has
to
be
as
low
as
you
are
selling
any
place
else,
so
you
are
promising
for
that
month
not
to
sell
in
any
other
state
at
any
lower
price.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
and
so
during
that
month
this
distiller,
midwest,
may
not
lower
his
price
on
liquor
that
he
is
sending
out
to
california.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
the
law
mean
if
it
doesn't
mean
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know.
well,
if
the
distiller
refuses
to...
if
he
lowers
his
price
on
liquor
he
is
sending
out
to
california,
he
is
violating
the
new
york
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
right.
well,
i
just
said
that
in
the
middle
of
the
month
he
lowers
his
price
on
liquor
sent
out
to
california,
and
so
he
is
selling
liquor
to
californians
at
a
lower
price
than
he
is
charging
new
york
wholesalers.
he
is
violating
the
new
york
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
that
just
because
it
has
a
substantial
impact
on
interstate
commerce
between
the
distiller
and
his
california
customers,
you
just
say
that
isn't
much
of
an
impact.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
brown-forman
going
to
do,
have
to
do
about
these
promotion
allowances
that
the
authority
is
after
them
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
tell
me
that
the
authority
has
never
challenged
what
amounts
to
a
reduction
of
price
in
another
state--
justice
byron
r.
white
--without
lowering
it
in
new
york.
that
is
what
this
argument
is
all
about.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
promotional--
