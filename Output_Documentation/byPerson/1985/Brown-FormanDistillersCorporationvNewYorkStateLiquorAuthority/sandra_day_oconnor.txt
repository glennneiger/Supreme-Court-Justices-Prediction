but,
mr.
flinn,
even
in
the
retrospective
situation,
it
seems
that
the
statute
would
actually
affect
prices
out
of
state
eventually.
the
wholesaler
has
to
look
ahead
and
see
what
is
happening,
so
it
is
a
little
strange.

mr.
constantine,
it
does
appear
that
the
new
york
statute
effectively
sets
minimum
prices
outside
new
york,
at
least
for
an
interval
of
time,
doesn't
it?
