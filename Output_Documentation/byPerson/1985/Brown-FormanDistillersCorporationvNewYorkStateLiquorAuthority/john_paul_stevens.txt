mr.
flinn,
could
i
interrupt
with
just
one
question
on
this
point?
do
any
states...
do
all
states
that
have
this
kind
of
statute
provide
for
monthly
periods
of
prices?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
flinn,
may
i
just...
your
argument
is
strongest,
it
seems
to
me,
when
you
focus
on
a
mid-month
price
reduction,
something
like
that,
but
are
there
such
price
reductions?
if
most
states
require
this
monthly
period
pricing,
how
often...
does
the
record
tell
us
how
often
there
are
price
reductions
of
this
kind?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
seem
to
me
this
is
entirely
possible,
and
i
don't
know
whether
this
is
a
fact
or
not,
that
if
there
is
a
substantial
number
of
states
that
require
posting
on
a
monthly
basis,
that
maybe
there
is
an
industry
custom
of
price
changes
at
monthly
intervals,
and
there
may
not
be
the
problem
you
describe.
i
just
don't
know.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
constantine,
may
i
interrupt?
particularly
with
regard
to
the
second
point,
say
we
didn't
have
liquor,
and
i
understand
of
course
you
have
the
twenty-first
amendment,
but
say
it
was
automobiles
or
gasoline
or
something.
do
you
think
a
statute
like
this
would
be
free
of
commerce
clause
challenge
if
it
applied
to
some
other
product
that
obviously
was
sold
at
many
different
prices
around
the
country?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if,
for
example,
in
automobiles,
say
there
is
a
big
transportation
cost
of
getting
a
car
from
michigan
to
new
york.
if
new
york
said
you
can't
sell
it...
you
must
sell
at
least
as
cheaply
in
new
york
as
you
do
in
michigan,
it
clearly
would
require
some
impact
out
of
the
state
of
new
york
on
pricing,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
say
just
because
of
different
competitive
situations,
there
certainly
are
market
forces
that
vary
in
different
parts
of
the
country.
you
say
that
you
think
there
would
be
no
problem
with
this
statute
no
matter
what
the
product
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
that
the
different
rules
apply
after
the
backus
imports
case?
