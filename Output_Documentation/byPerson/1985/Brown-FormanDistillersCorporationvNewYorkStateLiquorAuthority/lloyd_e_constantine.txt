mr.
lloyd
e.
constantine
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
question
before
the
court
today
is
whether
new
york
may
insist
that
liquor
prices
to
new
york
wholesalers
be
as
low
as
prices
charged
elsewhere
in
the
country
as
part
of
its
comprehensive
regulatory
scheme
for
liquor.
new
york
attempted
to
secure
this
goal
by
means
of
a
nondiscriminatory
regulation
solely
directed
to
the
intrastate
sale
of
liquor.
writing
for
a
unanimous
court
in
the
1966
seagram
decision,
justice
stewart
reasoned
that
the
new
york
affirmation
law
had
a
legitimate
purpose,
that
it
was
solely
directed
to
intrastate
activities,
and
that
under
the
affirmation
law
new
york
was
exercising
the
core
power
granted
to
a
state
under
the
twenty-first
amendment,
which
is
to
regulate
the
importation
and
distribution
of
liquor
destined
for
sale
within
the
state's
borders.
the
new
york
affirmation
law
conforms
precisely
to
the
holding
in
seagram
that
consistent
with
both
the
twenty-first
amendment,
which
was
never
mentioned
in
mr.
flinn's
argument,
and
the
commerce
clause,
that
new
york
may
insist
that
liquor
prices
to
its
wholesalers
be
as
low
as
prices
charged
elsewhere
in
the
country.
the
policy
of
lowest
price
affirmation
which
has
been
adopted
in
39
states
and
which
dates
back
to
1938
cannot
be
invalidated
in
this
case
based
upon
these
speculative
claims
without
the
court
departing
from
its
consistent
interpretation
of
the
core
power
of
the
twenty-first
amendment,
and
without
also
departing
from
its
consistent
interpretation
of
the
commerce
clause,
and
this
would
be
accomplished
in
a
case
where
there
is
no
record
whatsoever
to
demonstrate
any
effect.
brown-forman's
allegations
are
simplistic
speculations
about
the
benefits
of
free
market
forces
in
a
liquor
market
which
is
otherwise
restrained
by
pervasive
regulation
throughout
the
country.
a
free
market
in
liquor
that
we
have
heard
about
today
has
not
existed
since
prohibition,
and
it
would
not
exist
if
the
court
invalidated
this
statute.
however,
if
the
court
invalidated
this
statute
based
upon
these
claims,
the
states
would
have
been
punished
for
their
reliance
upon
the
court's
holding
in
seagram.
the
states
would
be
left
to
adopt
truly
burdensome
alternatives
to
achieve
the
legitimate
goals
of
price
affirmation,
the
goals
which
this
court
said
were
legitimate,
and
the
states--
mr.
lloyd
e.
constantine
--no,
your
honor,
it
doesn't.
the
new
york
statute
does
one
thing.
it
says
to
a
distiller,
go
out
to
any
other
state
in
the
country.
thirty-eight
other
states
have
affirmation
laws
as
well.
go
to
those
states,
charge
any
price
that
you
want,
but
if
you
choose
to
sell
in
new
york,
grant
us
parity.
the
regulatory
effect
which
mr.
flinn
has
talked
about
without
the
support
of
any
record,
made
out
of
whole
cloth,
is
merely
speculation.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record.
there
is
no
record.
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
demonstrate
either
of
the
effects
which
brown-forman
alleges
in
this
case.
principally
those
are
two
effects.
first,
that
the
affirmation
law
has
the
effect
of
preventing
brown-forman
and
other
distillers
from
making
midmonth
price
changes,
and
second,
that
the
affirmation
law
has
the
effect
of
preventing
a
distiller's
pricing
decision
in
other
states,
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
about
that,
your
honor.
mr.
lloyd
e.
constantine
it
would
not
be
free
of
commerce
clause
challenge,
your
honor,
but
if
the
court
were
consistent
with
its
commerce
clause
jurisprudence
up
to
today,
that
challenge
should
be
rejected
because
the
type
of
effect
which
brown-forman
talks
about
has
never
been
considered
to
be
a
burden
on
commerce
under
the
court's
commerce
clause
jurisprudence.
instead,
this
discussion
about
perversion
of
free
market
forces,
suspension
of
free
market
forces
have
always
been
considered
to
be
concerns
of
the
antitrust
law.
the
commerce
clause
has
been
interpreted
by
this
court
to
prohibit
discrimination
between
the
states.
the
commerce
clause
enacted
a
common
market
among
the
states.
mr.
lloyd
e.
constantine
the
new
york
affirmation
law,
your
honor,
provides
for
differentials
in
transportation
cost
and
taxes.
the
state
has
already
considered
that
legitimate
interest.
mr.
lloyd
e.
constantine
i
would
say
that
if
a
court
adhered
to
the
principles
and
it
is
heretofore
stated
under
the
commerce
clause,
there
would
be
no
problem.
however,
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
in
the
appropriate
case,
that
because
the
hallmark
of
a
court's
commerce
clause
jurisprudence
has
been
its
flexibility,
it
is
not
a
discussion
of
absolutes.
it
has
been
extended
to
new
sorts
of
burdens
and
new
sorts
of
effects,
that
in
that
type
of
case
the
court
might
for
the
first
time
want
to
consider
whether
serious
perversion
of
free
market
forces
would
raise
commerce
clause
concerns.
mr.
lloyd
e.
constantine
that
is
not
correct,
your
honor.
this
statute
has
never
been
applied
to
prevent
a
distiller
from
lowering
his
price
in
another
state.
in
the
20
years
since
the
seagram
decision,
neither
brown-forman--
mr.
lloyd
e.
constantine
--well,
your
honor,
the
argument
is
about
what
brown-forman
came
to
this
court
about.
brown-forman
came
to
this
court
alleging
a
totally
different
case,
a
different
sort
of
harm.
the
court
refused
to
take--
mr.
lloyd
e.
constantine
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lloyd
e.
constantine
you
are
promising
for
that
month,
your
honor,
to
sell
to
new
york
at
the
lowest
price
you
charge
elsewhere.
mr.
lloyd
e.
constantine
well,
your
honor.
mr.
lloyd
e.
constantine
your
honor,
i
don't
know,
because
in
the
20
years
since
the
case--
mr.
lloyd
e.
constantine
--the
law
means
that
new
york
has
to
be
granted
parity
with
other
states,
your
honor.
i
do
know
that--
mr.
lloyd
e.
constantine
--if
the
distiller
charges
a
price
in
another
state
and
thereafter
charges
a
higher
price
in
new
york,
he
is
violating
the
law.
mr.
lloyd
e.
constantine
that's
right,
your
honor,
and
that
is
because
the
law
says
exactly
what--
mr.
lloyd
e.
constantine
--well,
your
honor,
this
court
has
always
held
that
the
states
retain
a
residuum
of
power
to
enact
regulations
concerning
matters
of
local
concern
which
to
some
extent
regulate
commerce
or
affect
commerce.
but
this
type
of
presumed,
speculative
regulatory
effect
has
never
been
considered
burdensome
by
this
court.
in
the
parker
versus
brown
case
in
1943
the
effect
of
the
california
prorate
program
in
that
case
was
to
raise
and
stabilize
the
price
of
95
percent
of
the
country's
raisins
and
one-half
of
the
world's
raisins,
a
very
substantial
effect.
that
was
the
court's
term.
but
that
was
not
considered
to
be
a
burden
on
commerce
under
the
court's
commerce
clause
jurisprudence.
in
the
case
of
cities
service
versus
peerless
oil
in
1951,
the
court
was
looking
at
a
regulation
which
had
the
effect
of
doubling
the
price
of
natural
gas
at
the
wellhead,
doubling
the
price
demonstrated
in
the
record,
not
like
here,
where
we
are
speculating
about
what
might
happen,
but
a
demonstrated
doubling
of
the
price.
the
court
held
that
that
doubling
of
the
wholesale
price
of
natural
gas
did
not
constitute
a
burden
on
commerce
under
its
commerce
clause
jurisprudence.
in
the
case
of
exxon
versus
the
governor
of
maryland,
the
court
observed
that
maryland's
divorcement
law
which
prevented
refiners
from
operating
a
gasoline
station
would
probably
have
the
effect
of
doing
away
with
high
volume,
low
priced
gasoline
stations.
the
court
said
that
effect
went
to
the
wisdom
of
the
statute,
not
to
its
burden
on
commerce.
so,
there
are
regulations
which
have
effects,
demonstrated
effects,
where
the
court
has
said
95
percent
of
the
country's
raisin
prices
have
been
raised,
and
they
have
obstructed
the
flow
of
raisins
outside
of
california,
but
that
is
not
a
burden
under
the
commerce
clause
jurisprudence.
but
here,
we
have
no
record
to
show
whether
the
prices
have
been
raised
in
other
states,
whether
the
prices
have
gone
down
in
new
york.
mr.
flinn
argued
that
he
thinks
that
the
harm
has
been
done
to
new
york
consumers,
because
in
a
so-called
free
market,
new
york
consumers
would
be
the
beneficiary
of
the
lowest
prices.
by
taking
this
case
under
a
facial
challenge,
without
a
record,
the
court
has
given
mr.
flinn
the
opportunity
to
engage
in
wild
speculation.
last
week,
in
the
decision
of
fisher
versus
the
city
of
berkeley,
this
court
axiomatically
stated
something
which
if
adhered
to
in
this
case
should
be
the
basis
for
the
rejection
of
all
these
claims.
in
the
berkeley
case,
the
court
refused
to
consider
the
challenge
to
berkeley's
rent
control
regulation
as
an
attempt
to
monopolize
under
section
2
of
the
sherman
act
because
the
effect
of
monopolization
and
the
attempt
at
monopolization
was
not
in
the
record,
and
it
was
not
a
result
which
clearly
flowed
from
the
face
of
the
statute.
now,
in
this
case,
there
are
two
effects
which
mr.
flinn
is
talking
about.
he
is
talking
about
this
prevention
of
making
mid-month
price
changes,
but
mr.
flinn's
client
didn't
try
to
make
a
mid-month
price
change,
and
they
were
incited
for
violating
the
law
in
that
regard,
and
no
distiller
has
ever
been
cited
for
violating
this
law
for
making
a
mid-month
price
change
in
any
other
state,
and
the
other
effect
which
he
talks
about
is
this
perversion
of
free
market
forces.
mr.
lloyd
e.
constantine
the
promotion
allowance
issue,
which,
of
course,
your
honor,
the
court
declined
to
hear,
what
the
state
has
said
in
that
regard
is
that
if
you
are
going
to
provide
the
promotion
allowances
in
other
states,
they
have
to
be
simply
cashed
out
in
new
york.
you
have
to
decide
what
amount
does
this
lower
the
price
of
a
bottle
of
jack
daniels,
or
what
amount
does
this
lower
the
price
of
a
case
of
jack
daniels,
and
simply
provide
that
to
new
york
wholesalers
in
a
cashed
out
equivalent.
mr.
lloyd
e.
constantine
it
has
never
challenged--
mr.
lloyd
e.
constantine
--it
has
never
challenged
a
bid
month
price
change.
in
the
case
of
the--
mr.
lloyd
e.
constantine
--the
promotional
discount
was
not
a
mid-month
price
change.
brown-forman
was
affording
that
from...
throughout
the
country.
they
came
to
new
york
and
said,
we
want
to
do
the
same
thing
in
new
york.
new
york
has
an
explicit
statutory
ban
on
liquor
discounting.
we
said,
you
can't
do
that
here,
but
what
you
have
to
do,
you
simply
have
to
decide
how
much
this
lowers
the
price
of
a
bottle
or
a
case
of
your
liquor
and
then
provide
this
to
wholesalers
on
a
cash
basis,
and
that
is
precisely
what
was
done
with
seagram,
another
distiller,
and
the
example
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
seagram
wanted
to
do
the
same
type
of
promotional
plan.
a
waiver
was
provided
under
the
good
cause
provision
which
your
honor
alluded
to
before
in
24
hours.
in
24
hours
seagram
was
given
permission
to
cash
out
the
discount
and
provide
it
on
an
equal
basis
to
new
york
wholesalers.
the
perversion
of
free
market
forces
which
brown-forman
alleges
in
this
case
goes
something
like
this,
and
it
has
to
go
something
like
this
because
there
is
no
record,
but
if
a
distiller
did
not
have
to
suffer
from
the
so-called
inhibiting
influence
of
the
affirmation
law,
the
distiller
might
charge
a
higher
or
lower
price
to
a
wholesaler
in
one
of
the
eleven
states
that
doesn't
have
an
affirmation
law,
because
39
states
do.
and
then
that
wholesaler
would
pass
on
that
higher
or
lower
price
to
a
retailer,
and
then
that
retailer
would
pass
on
that
higher
or
lower
price
to
a
consumer,
and
that
consumer
would
benefit
from
the
fact
that
the
price
he
paid
for
that
bottle
of
liquor
was
dictated
by
so-called
free
market
forces
rather
than
dictated
by
the
so-called
perverting
influence
of
the
affirmation
law.
i
can
think
of
no
more
speculative,
attenuated,
and
simplistic
depiction
of
so-called
free
market
forces
in
a
market
where
there
aren't
any
free
market
forces.
mr.
flinn
has
told
you
that
there
are
posting
requirements.
we
have
already
discussed
the
fact
that
there
are
discounting
restrictions
in
new
york
and
in
many
other
states.
there
are
bans
or
limitations
on
credit
transactions
in
many
states.
there
is
pervasive
regulation
in
many
states.
there
are
licensing
restrictions
in
many
states.
most
of
the
normal
incidents
of
competition
simply
don't
exist
in
the
liquor
industry.
to
talk
about
a
suspension
of
free
market
forces
is
a
contradiction
in
terms.
in
cases
where
there
was
a
free
market,
like
reeves
versus
state,
i
think,
a
1982
decision
of
this
court,
that
was
the
ready-mix
concrete
market.
when
the
plaintiff
talked
about
the
predicted
benefits
of
free
market
forces,
the
court
characterized
those
predictions
as
being
simple
minded
speculation,
but
at
least
there
was
a
record
in
that
case.
there
is
no
record
in
this
case.
dealing
with
another
regulated
industry,
the
natural
gas
industry,
in
the
case
i
discussed
before,
cities
services
versus
peerless
oil,
the
court
noted
that
a
doubling
of
the
wholesale
price
of
gas
might
have
only
an
attenuated
effect
on
ultimate
consumers.
if
a
demonstrated
doubling
of
a
wholesale
price
might
only
have
an
attenuated
effect
on
ultimate
consumers,
how
much
more
is
the
attenuated
effect
in
this
case,
how
much
more
attenuated
is
the
effect
in
this
case
where
there
is
no
record
to
show
that
the
prices
have
gone
up
or
gone
down
in
new
york
or
in
any
other
state.
this
court
observed
in
the
seagram
decisions
that
we
don't
know
whether
this
is
going
to
produce
higher
prices
in
new
york
or
lower
prices
or
higher
prices
outside
the
state.
we
still
don't
know,
your
honor.
twenty
years
have
gone
by
and
we
have
not
moved
one
inch
in
terms
of
knowing
more
about
the
effects
of
this
case.
this
case
is
before
the
court
really
almost
by
accident.
brown-forman
began
this
case
to
challenge
a
wholly
different
practice
and
a
different
provision.
the
interaction
between
new
york's
ban
on
liquor
discounting
and
the
affirmation
law.
along
the
way
the
healey
case
was
decided
by
the
second
circuit.
they
got
to
the
appellate
division
of
the
new
york
state
supreme
court
and
they
changed
their
rationale
and
they
inserted
this
argument,
but
they
inserted
an
argument
that
they
have
no
stake
in
because
they
haven't
been
cited
for
violating
the
law
in
this
regard,
and
they
have
no
record
to
show
that
prices
have
gone
up
or
down
or
there
has
been
any
perverting
influence.
now,
one
thing
which
has
been
missing,
conspicuously
missing
from
mr.
flinn's
argument
is
any
mention
of
the
other
constitutional
provision
which
is
at
issue
in
this
case.
this
case
calls
the
court
to
reconcile
a
conflict
between
two
parts
of
the
same
constitution,
and
that
other
part
of
the
constitution,
your
honor,
is
the
twenty-first
amendment.
now,
mr.
flinn
in
his
brief,
although
he
has
conspicuously
avoided
it
in
his
argument,
seems
to
suggest
that
the
same
rules
apply,
the
same
rules
of
the
road
apply
in
this
case
as
in
any
other
commerce
clause
case.
justice
friendly,
who...
sorry,
judge
friendly,
who
just
wrote
a
decision
upholding
the
posting
requirements
which
were
discussed
by
mr.
flinn
in
the
case
of
battipuglia
versus
state
liquor
authority,
and
those
posting
requirements
are
part
of
the
very
same
law
that
are
issued
here
said
for
some
of
us
who
were
present
at
the
creation
of
the
twenty-first
amendment,
there
is
an
aura
of
unreality
in
plaintiff's
assumption
that
we
must
examine
the
validity
of
new
york's
alcoholic
beverage
control
law
just
as
we
would
examine
the
constitutionality
of
a
state
statute
governing
the
sale
of
gasoline.
what
judge
friendly
was
saying
there
is
that
a
special
rule
applies
in
the
twenty-first
amendment.
the
twenty-first
amendment
was
enacted--
mr.
lloyd
e.
constantine
--well,
your
honor,
if
the
court
adheres
to
the
rule
in
seagram,
the
court
has
to
reject
brown-forman's
claim
in
this
case,
and
this
case
really
is
a
reargument
of
seagram,
because
we
have
no
additional
record.
the
court
said
in
seagram,
come
back
to
this
court
when
you
have
demonstrated
the
actual
extraterritorial
effects
that
these
statutes
may
produce.
don't
come
back
with
a
facial
challenge.
and
we
are
back
with
a
facial
challenge,
with
no
more
information,
with
no
record
whatsoever.
mr.
flinn
was
discussing
the
change
in
the
statute,
the
great
change
which
occurred
in
1966.
that
great
change
was
the
change
in
the
statute
from
a
retrospective
affirmation
provision
to
a
concurrent
affirmation
provision,
and
that
was
made
because
brown-forman
and
a
bunch
of
other
distillers
went
to
the
legislature
and
the
governor
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
said,
we
are
being
burdened.
this
provision
is
onerous.
it
prevents
us
from
raising
our
prices.
please
change
the
law.
so
the
legislature
made
that
one
change.
it
changed
the
law
from
a
retrospective
statute
to
a
current
statute.
at
the
time
that
they
were
supporting
the
change,
they
called
it
a
current
statute.
now
to
characterize
it
invidiously,
they
call
it
a
prospective
statute,
but
obviously
the
prospectivity
is
merely
an
incident
of
the
posting
process
which
exists
in
eleven
states
by
statute
and
in
the
eighteen
other
states
by
contractual
warranties,
but
they
said
change
this
statute,
so
the
legislature
responded
to
them,
and
they
changed
the
law,
and
they
removed
the
only
burden
which
is
associated
with
a
retrospective
affirmation
statute.
so
if
the
court
were
not
to
overrule
seagram
in
this
case
but
merely
hold
that
a
concurrent
or
contemporaneous
statute
was
a
burden
on
commerce,
then
the
court
would
be
saying
two
things,
one,
go
back
to
a
more
burdensome
way
of
doing
things,
and
the
court
will
be
violating
the
single
most
important
test
which
the
court
has
set
out
in
the
case
of
pike
versus
bruce
church,
which
is
the
test
which
sets
up
the
balancing
standard,
the
balance
of
interest
between
state
and
federal
interests.
the
most
important
part
of
that
test
is
the
search
for
the
least
burdensome
alternative
and
a
practical
assessment
of
disallowing
the
state's
action.
the
assessment
of
the
least
burdensome
alternative
in
this
case
would
show
clearly
that
the
state
has
already
adopted
the
least
burdensome
alternative.
the
state
has
adopted
an
alternative
that
is
less
burdensome
because
the
distiller
asked
us
to
do
that,
and
the
state
more
specifically
adopted
the
explicit
holding
in
seagram.
if
you
look
at
your
holding
in
seagram,
you
will
see
the
new
york
statute.
the
statute
does
exactly
what
the
holding
says.
it
says,
it
insists
that
liquor
prices
to
domestic
wholesalers
be
as
low
as
prices
charged
elsewhere
in
the
country.
the
previous
statute
did
not
do
that
specifically
because
it
merely
tried
to
insist
by
referencing
it
to
previously
charged
prices.
so
now
we
have
adopted
this
least
burdensome
alternative.
what
would
be
the
practical
result
of
disallowing
this
statute?
new
york,
which
was
once
the
subject
of
price
discrimination
to
the
tune
of
$150
million
a
year,
would
likely
become
again
the
subject
of
price
discrimination
to
the
tune
of
$150
million
a
year,
and
the
state
would
probably
adopt
a
more
burdensome
approach
to
achieving
a
goal
that
has
already
been
determined
legitimate
by
this
court.
the
court
said
that
the
goal
of
price
equality
was
a
legitimate
one,
of
ending
price
discrimination
was
a
legitimate
one.
and
the
court
has
always
said
that
protecting
a
consumer's
pocketbook
is
as
important
as
protecting
any
other
interest
of
the
state,
as
important
as
protecting
the
state's
environment,
which
is
what
the
court
said
in
philadelphia
versus
new
jersey.
so
if
the
court
disallows
this
provision
in
the
name
of
the
commerce
clause,
it
is
going
to
be
forcing
the
state
to
adopt
a
more
burdensome
alternative,
and
that
burdensome
alternative
might
take
the
form
of
a
retrospective
price
affirmation
statute,
or
it
might
take
the
form
of
price
regulation,
where
the
state
actually
gets
into
the
business
of
setting
prices
and
fixing
prices
or
state
maximum
set
prices.
and
this
court
has
always
considered
those
types
of
regulations
to
be
legitimate
over
challenges
under
the
substantive
due
process
principles
in
nevia
versus
the
people
of
the
state
of
new
york,
over
commerce
clause
challenges
in
cities
service
versus
peerless
oil,
over
antitrust
challenges
just
last
week,
in
fisher
versus
the
city
of
berkeley.
now,
to
get
back
to
the
twenty-first
amendment
and
the
special
rules
that
apply
in
this
type
of
commerce
clause
case,
because
the
court
has
to
resolve
what
may
be
a
conflict
between
two
sections
of
the
law.
i
submit
there
is
no
conflict.
i
submit
in
response
to
justice
brennan's
question
that
the
court
can
uphold
the
statute
without
ever
reaching
the
twenty-first
amendment.
we
don't
need
the
twenty-first
amendment.
but
if
we
get
to
the
twenty-first
amendment,
we
know
that
different
rules
apply.
the
twenty-first
amendment,
second
section,
provides
a
test.
mr.
lloyd
e.
constantine
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
all
that
backus
determined
was
that
a
state
could
not
use
its
authority
to
control
importation
distribution
for
a
wholly
discriminatory
purpose,
and
the
court
said
that
hawaii's
action
in
the
backus
case
was
not
in
furtherance
of
temperance
or
any
other...
any
other
legitimate
core
power
of
the
twenty-first
amendment.
those
other
purposes
are
controlling
the
distribution
of
liquor
within
the
state.
the
court
has
always
held
that
the
control
of
importation
and
distribution
and
the
structuring
of
the
liquor
distribution
system
is
the
very
essence
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
power.
that
is
what
the
court
said
in
capital
city
cable
versus
crisp,
which
was
the
last
case
which
was
argued
before
this
case
under
the
twenty-first
amendment,
argued
six
weeks
after
the
backus
decision
which
you
have
alluded
to...
argued
six
weeks
after
backus
was
actually
argued.
in
that
case
there
was
a
temperance-based
regulation,
a
ban
on
advertising,
and
the
court
said
that
the
fcc's
interest
in
their
regulation
of
cable
signals
preempted
oklahoma's
advertising
ban,
even
though
it
was
temperance
based,
because
oklahoma
was
not
invoking
the
core
power,
and
the
core
power
was,
and
i
quote,
"the
central
power
is
exercising
control
over
whether
to
permit
importation
or
sale
of
liquor
and
how
to
structure
the
liquor
distribution
system.
"
that
is
consistent
with
backus.
that
is
consistent
with
seagram.
that
is
consistent
with
the
idlewild
case
of
1964.
it
is
consistent
with
the
heublin
case
of
1972.
it
is
consistent
with
the
midcal
case,
where
the
court
struck
the
california
rpm
system,
but
said
california
wasn't
exercising
the
core
power
of
the
twenty-first
amendment,
but
specifically
referred
to
the
seagrams
case
as
the
case
in
which
a
state
was
exercising
that
core
power.
the
seagrams
case
has
become
synonymous
with
the
core
power
under
the
twenty-first
amendment.
i
mentioned
before
the
heublin
case.
in
that
case
you
had
what
would
otherwise
have
been
a
per
se
violation
of
the
commerce
clause,
a
requirement
that
a
state...
a
requirement
by
the
state
of
south
carolina
that
a
distiller,
heublin,
maintain
a
business
presence
in
the
state
that
it
didn't
want
to,
to
do
something
which
it
could
have
done
more
efficiently
in
another
state.
in
other
contexts,
the
court
has
disallowed
that
type
of
regulation,
in
tumer
against
whitsel,
in
foster
fountain
packing
versus
heidel,
in
pike
versus
bruce
church,
in
johnson
against
heidel,
but
special
rules
apply
in
the
twenty-first
amendment
context.
not
only
did
the
twenty-first
amendment,
that
exercise
of
core
power
overcome
what
would
otherwise
be
a
per
se
violation
of
the
commerce
clause,
but
it
overcame
15
usc
section
381(a),
and
justice
blackmun
in
that
case
even
indicated
that
the
application
of
that
section
to
the
state
in
that
case
was
unconstitutional,
almost
a
reverse
preemption
argument.
so,
a
different
rule
applies
here.
the
states
are
virtually
unconstrained
by
traditional
commerce
clause
considerations
when
they
are
acting
within
the
core
power
of
the
twenty-first
amendment.
i
see
that
my
time
is
just
about
up.
and
therefore,
in
summation,
i
would
just
like
to
say
that
the
court's
commerce
clause
jurisprudence
has
been
exemplified
by
its
flexibility.
it
is
not
an
exercise
in
absolutes.
there
is
nothing
which
foreordains
one
result
or
another.
but
the
court
should
not
extend
the
concept
of
burden
on
commerce
which
would
be
true
in
this
case
for
the
first
time
to
a
so-called
suspension
of
free
market
forces
in
a
case
where
there
is
no
record,
no
discrimination,
no
direct
regulation
of
interstate
commerce,
and
no
free
market,
and
the
reason
there
is
no
free
market
is
because
the
states
are
exercising
their
core
power
under
the
twenty-first
amendment.
thank
you
very
much.
it
has
been
an
honor
to
be
here.
