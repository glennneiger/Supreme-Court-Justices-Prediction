mr.
joseph
t.
mc
laughlin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
we
seek
affirmance
of
the
circuit
court's
determination
that
crawford
bullock
could
not
lawfully
be
sentenced
to
death
for
capital
murder
where
the
jury
was
not
instructed
to
find
and
did
not
find
that
he
killed,
attempted
to
kill,
intended
to
kill,
or
contemplated
the
use
of
lethal
force.
this
result,
dictated
by
this
court's
decisions
in
enmund,
lockett,
mullany,
and
others,
means
simply
that
the
defendant
may
be
resentenced
properly
under
the
amended
mississippi
death
penalty
statute
which
specifically
requires
the
jury
to
find
that
the
defendant's
conduct
satisfies
one
or
more
of
the
enmund
factors
before
it
may
determine
whether
to
impose
the
death
sentence.
crawford
bullock's
death
sentence
was
imposed
and
upheld
by
the
mississippi
supreme
court
prior
to
this
court's
decision
in
enmund,
and
it
was
not
based
on
his
personal
responsibility
or
his
moral
guilt.
there
are
at
least
four
things
this
case
is
not
about,
and
i
would
like
to
start
by
exploring
them
briefly.
first,
we
seek
no
limit
on
the
power
of
the
state
to
define
crimes,
including
felony
murder,
but
we
do
urge
consistency
with
this
court's
own
view
expressed
in
lockett
where
the
court
said
states
have
authority
to
make
aiders
and
abetters
equally
responsible
as
a
matter
of
law
with
principles
or
to
enact
felony
murder
statutes,
but
the
definition
of
a
crime
does
not
automatically
dictate
the
proper
penalty.
second,
we
seek
no
redefinition
or
refinement
of
enmund
which
in
words
of
plain
meaning
and
common
understanding
prohibits,
we
would
submit,
the
execution
of
one
who
does
not
kill,
attempt
to
kill,
intend
to
kill,
or
contemplate
that
lethal
force
would
be
used.
mr.
joseph
t.
mc
laughlin
i
am
addressing
the
charge,
your
honor,
but
i
also
feel
and
will
address
the
point
that
the
mississippi
supreme
court
did
not
make
findings
with
respect
to
the
ability
or
the
eligibility
of
crawford
bullock
to
be
sentenced
to
death.
the
mississippi
supreme
court
discussed
in
the
two
places
cited
in
the
appendix
by
counsel
for
the
petitioner
a
concept
of
accessory
or
aiding
and
abetting
liability.
indeed,
their
opinion
came
down
before
the
enmund
decision.
they
did
not
purport
to
and
did
not
make
any
enmund
findings.
i
think
it
is
very
important,
frankly,
to
focus
on
what
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
did
say.
first,
with
respect
to
the
sentence
on
page
a-81
cited
by
counsel
for
the
petitioners--
mr.
joseph
t.
mc
laughlin
--eighty-one,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
sentence
that
was
read
was
that
the
appellant
was
present,
aiding,
and
assisting
in
the
assault
upon
and
slaying
of
dickson.
now,
just
prior
to
that,
the
court
lays
out
the
standard
by
which
it
reaches
that
conclusion,
which
i
submit
is
not
a
finding.
just
above
that,
on
that
very
same
page,
the
court
says
that
in
passing
upon
a
motion
for
a
directed
verdict
in
a
criminal
case,
beginning
now
to
read
at
the
top
of
page
a-81,
"all
evidence
most
favorable
to
the
state
together
with
reasonable
inferences
are
considered
as
true,
and
evidence
favorable
to
the
appellant
is
disregarded.
"
that,
i
submit,
is
perhaps
a
standard
of
appellate
review.
it
is
not
a
finding
weighing
the
evidence
that
this
particular
person
meets
any
one
of
the
enmund
criteria.
secondly,
the
mississippi
supreme
court
at
page
a-117,
your
honors,
in
talking
about
the
participation,
the
active
participation
of
crawford
bullock
in
the
assault
and
homicide
was
talking
about
the
statutory
crime
of
felony
or
capital
murder
under
the
law
of
mississippi.
we
do
not
challenge
the
guilt
of
mr.
bullock.
we
have
not
challenged
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
to
support
his
guilt
of
the
crime
of
capital
murder.
i
think
it
is
important
to
put
in
context
what
the
mississippi
supreme
court
said,
because
on
page
a-116,
the
mississippi
supreme
court
introduced
their
conclusion
that
mr.
bullock
was
an
active
participant
in
the
homicide
by
saying,
and
i
quote
from
the
middle
of
the
page,
"the
law
is
well
settled
in
this
state
that
any
person
who
is
present,
aiding,
and
abetting
another
in
commission
of
a
crime
is
equally
guilty
with
the
principal
offender.
"
it
is
fair
for
the
mississippi
supreme
court
to
have
said--
mr.
joseph
t.
mc
laughlin
--my
point,
mr.
chief
justice,
is--
mr.
joseph
t.
mc
laughlin
--yes,
i
believe
that
is
correct,
and
they
are
not
making
the
specific
kind
of
finding
required
before
someone
may
be
put
to
death.
mr.
joseph
t.
mc
laughlin
your
honor,
that
sentence
at
the
top
of
page
117
follows
exactly
upon
their
statement,
if
you
will,
of
the
law
of
mississippi,
namely
that
a
person
who
aids
and
abets
in
the
commission
of
a
crime,
here
either
the
crime
of
robbery,
of
which
the
defendant,
mr.
bullock,
was
found
guilty--
mr.
joseph
t.
mc
laughlin
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
the
mississippi
supreme
court
was
purporting
to
review
the
evidence
on
the
record
before
them.
i
think--
mr.
joseph
t.
mc
laughlin
--i
think,
your
honor,
they
were
simply
restating
the
law
of
mississippi
that
a
person
who
aids
and
abets
in
the
commission
of
a
crime,
and
here
the
crime
could
either
be
robbery
or
the
crime
of
capital
murder,
which
does
not
require
and
did
not
require
in
this
case
that
crawford
bullock
kill,
attempt
to
kill,
intend
to
kill,
or
contemplate
the
use
of
lethal
force.
it
only
required,
and
this
is
where
the
jury
charge,
i
think,
is
most
instructive,
because
it
is
based
on
the
statute,
which
of
course
is
what
the
mississippi
supreme
court
is
talking
about.
it
only
required
that
the
man
be
present,
present
at
the
scene,
that
he
consent
to
the
killing.
mr.
joseph
t.
mc
laughlin
yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
we
are.
mr.
joseph
t.
mc
laughlin
your
honor,
if
they
were
purporting
to
state
the
fact,
and
the
fact
they
were
purporting
to
state
was
that
mr.
bullock
killed,
attempted
to
kill,
intended
to
kill,
or
contemplated
that
lethal
force
would
be
used,
they
didn't
say
it.
what
they
said
was,
under
the
law
of
mississippi,
a
person
who
aids
and
abets
in
the
commission
of
a
crime
is
equally
guilty.
what
the
mississippi
supreme
court
also
said
was
that
rickie
tucker
beat
and
killed
the
deceased.
they
did
not
say
that
mr.
bullock
struck
or
beat
or
killed
the
deceased.
what
they
said
was,
he
was
present,
and
under
the
law
of
mississippi,
as
an
aider
and
abetter--
mr.
joseph
t.
mc
laughlin
--your
honor,
he
is
a
statutory
participant
in
the
crime
because
he
was
present.
mr.
joseph
t.
mc
laughlin
your
honor,
the
mississippi
supreme
court
said
that
they
accepted
crawford
bullock's
statement
of
the
facts,
and
indeed
they
based
their
statement
of
the
facts
upon
them.
they
said
further
that
his
testimony
at
the
trial
was
consistent
with
the
statement
that
he
gave
to
the
police,
which
is
in
the
record.
in
that
statement,
mr.
bullock
said
he
was
present.
he
did
not
strike
the
deceased.
rickie
tucker
struck
the
deceased,
and
he
killed
him.
mr.
joseph
t.
mc
laughlin
i
would
submit
respectfully
that
that
is
a
restatement
of
the
law
of
mississippi,
and
the
law
of
mississippi
is
that
a
person
is
deemed
to
be
equally
guilty
with
the
principal,
with
the
person
who
commits
the
crime,
if
he
is
present
and
he
aids
and
abets
in
the
offense.
the
offense
here
is
either
the
robbery
or
the
capital
murder.
neither
of
those
offenses
requires
a
finding
by
anyone,
and
the
mississippi
supreme
court,
i
submit,
did
not
make
such
a
finding,
that
mr.
bullock
killed,
attempted
to
kill,
intended
to
kill,
or
contemplated
the
use
of
lethal
force.
mr.
joseph
t.
mc
laughlin
your
honor,
yes,
i
am
defending
the
fifth
circuit's
opinion,
because
it
concludes--
mr.
joseph
t.
mc
laughlin
--it
does
not
address
the
description
by
the
mississippi
supreme
court.
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
t.
mc
laughlin
well,
your
honor,
perhaps
in
the
perfect
world
it
should
have,
but
i
think
the
point
here
is
that
there
was
no--
mr.
joseph
t.
mc
laughlin
--yes,
your
honor,
we
would
be.
mr.
joseph
t.
mc
laughlin
i
would
be
saying
that
the
jury
must
make
the
finding,
depending
upon
the
facts
of
the
individual
case,
the
charge
that
is
given
to
the
jury,
the
nature
of
the
crime--
mr.
joseph
t.
mc
laughlin
--i
would
say,
your
honor,
here,
first
of
all,
it
doesn't
satisfy
mississippi's
own
law.
it
doesn't
satisfy
the
constitution
because
it
doesn't
satisfy
mississippi's
law.
mr.
joseph
t.
mc
laughlin
secondly,
i
would
say
it
does
not
satisfy
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
unless--
mr.
joseph
t.
mc
laughlin
--because,
your
honor,
it
is
our
position
that
the
enmund
findings,
the
establishment
of
the
threshold
beyond
which
one
must
ask
before
one
can
be
eligible
for
the
sentence
of
death,
is
like,
is
equivalent
to
the
component,
an
element
of
the
crime
which
the
jury
must
find
for
the
reasons
this
court
has
set
forth
over
time
as
to
why
the
jury
is
an
important
protection.
but
i
do
think
it
is
important
to
note
here--
mr.
joseph
t.
mc
laughlin
--no,
your
honor.
i
was--
mr.
joseph
t.
mc
laughlin
--not
necessarily.
i
was
attempting--
mr.
joseph
t.
mc
laughlin
--your
honor,
under
our
argument
that
mississippi
law
compels
this
result,
that
is
not
necessarily
true.
mr.
joseph
t.
mc
laughlin
well,
it
is
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
applies
the
law
of
mississippi
or
requires,
since
mississippi
has
protected
this
interest,
that
the
jury
do
it.
mr.
joseph
t.
mc
laughlin
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
when
one
looks
at
hicks
versus
oklahoma,
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
their
reply
to
protect
a
state-protected
liberty
interest,
and
that
is
the
case
upon
which
we
were
relying,
but
i
think
it
is
important
to
clarify
one
thing,
if
i
may,
in
response
to
your
question.
it
is
not
necessarily
the
case
that
an
appellate
court
or
a
reviewing
court,
let
us
say,
could
not
find
that
enmund
was
satisfied,
and
let
me
explain.
first,
it
is
not
necessary
that
the
questions
that
the
mississippi
law
now
requires
be
asked
in
every
capital
murder
case,
it
is
not
necessary
that
those
questions
precisely
be
asked
outside
the
state
of
mississippi.
if,
for
example,
the
statute
under
which
the
defendant
was
indicted
and
convicted
required
the
jury
to
find
that
the
person
intentionally
or
with
malice
aforethought
took
life.
the
statute
takes
care
of
it.
enmund
is
satisfied
because
the
man
was
charged
with
intentional
killing.
second,
it
is
not
necessary
that
these
questions
be
asked,
or
that
the
jury
be
involved
specifically.
if,
for
example,
the
defendant
was
the
sole
actor
in
the
crime,
and
this
is
undisputed,
because
there
a
jury
verdict,
even
a
general
verdict
of
guilt
under
a
felony,
a
classic
felony
murder
statute,
necessarily
means
that
the
defendant
took
life.
now,
it
doesn't
answer
the
question
raised
by
the
amicus
as
to
whether
or
not
it
is
required
constitutionally
also
to
find
that
there
was
an
intentional
taking
of
life,
but
putting
that
question
aside,
if
there
is
a
sole
actor
in
any
of
these
cases
in
the
eleventh
circuit,
the
wainwright
cases,
et
cetera,
are
cases
where
the
only
person
involved
in
the
crime
is
the
person
whom
the
jury
convicts.
it
would
not
be
necessary
in
those
cases
to
go
back
and
resentence
and
ask
question
which
are
really
pointless,
because
the
jury
has
already
made
the
determination
which
satisfies
enmund
if
enmund
does
not
require
more
than
just
a
killing.
third,
if
the
defendant
was
convicted
of
felony
murder
but
the
jury
found
an
aggravating
circumstance
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
defendant
intentionally
killed
during
the
commission
of
the
predicate
felony,
it
would
not
be
necessary
in
my
view
to
go
back
and
require
of
the
questions
that
mississippi
has
decided
must
be
put
in
every
case
could
be
put
in
other
states
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law.
enmund
would
be
satisfied,
and
indeed
there
are
statutes
which
are
quite
explicit
on
the
point.
indiana,
which
is
an
amicus
in
this
case,
has
a
statute--
mr.
joseph
t.
mc
laughlin
--the
ross
case
comes
out
of
georgia,
your
honor,
and
the
georgia
supreme
court
has
now
said
that
the
jury
must
find
specifically
either
capital
or
malice
murder.
mr.
joseph
t.
mc
laughlin
but
putting
that
aside,
your
honor,
the
eleventh
circuit
case,
the
ross
case
specifically,
does
conflict
on
its
face
with
the
holding
in
bullock,
because
it
says
the
jury
finding
is
not
required.
however--
mr.
joseph
t.
mc
laughlin
--no,
that
is
true,
your
honor.
it
didn't.
but
it
is
a
conflicting
decision
in
the
sense
that
the
two...
on
the
question
of
the...
the
role
of
the
jury
cannot
be
put
side
by
side
and
said
to
be
consistent,
but--
mr.
joseph
t.
mc
laughlin
--yes,
i
believe
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
t.
mc
laughlin
i
disagree
with
it
depending
on
the
facts,
because
as
i
was
about
to
say
in
addition
to
the
three
exceptions
i
have
already
given,
i
believe
there
are
at
least
two
more
exceptions
to
the
rule
that
the
questions
must
be
put
to
the
jury
at
least
in
a
state
like
mississippi,
which
requires
those
questions
to
be
put.
if,
for
example,
defendant
concedes
one
of
the
enmund
factors,
and
this
is
true
certainly
in
the
fourth
circuit
case,
which
is
cited
in
the
briefs,
ross...
roach,
excuse
me,
against
martin,
if
the
defendant
concedes
one
of
the
enmund
factors,
then
again
there
is
no
point
in
requiring
on
resentencing
under
enmund
a
jury
finding
specifically
addressed
to
the
enmund
question,
because
the
defendant
has
conceded
it.
it
is
not
an
issue.
and
finally
i
would
say
there
has
to
be
an
exception
to
take
into
account
those
cases,
and
i
think
this
exception
would
have
to
be
carefully
and
with
great
measure
applied.
but
to
take
into
account
those
cases
where,
for
example,
the
forensic
evidence
is
overwhelming,
the
testimony
is
overwhelming
that
it
was
the
specific
defendant
who
killed
or
intended
to
kill
or
attempted
to
kill
or
contemplated
that
lethal
force
would
be
used,
where
all
of
those
factors
come
together
to
such
a
point,
as
judge
clark
said
in
concurring
in
dissenting
in
the
eleventh
circuit
case
that
even
he
would
concur
in
the
result,
although
he
disagreed
with
the
reasoning
of
the
eleventh
circuit,
because,
he
said,
based
on
the
factors
as
he
knew
them,
that
was
the
right
result.
i
don't
know
what
the
trial
record
in
ross
would
show.
it
may
well
be
there
is
conflicting
evidence
there,
and
if
so--
mr.
joseph
t.
mc
laughlin
--well,
your
honor,
the
petitioner
here
has
never
argued
that.
it
has
never
been
an
issue
anywhere
in
the
fifth
circuit
or
here.
mr.
joseph
t.
mc
laughlin
well,
your
honor,
in
mississippi,
the
reason
for
it
is
that
the
legislature
determined
long
before
mr.
bullock
was
sentenced
that
the
jury
had
to
make
the
findings
both
at
the
guilt
stage
and
at
the
sentencing
stage,
and
that
they
had
to
sentence
the
defendant.
mr.
joseph
t.
mc
laughlin
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
t.
mc
laughlin
if
mississippi
had
a
different
law,
then
we
would
be
pushed,
frankly,
to
our
position,
that
the
due
process
clause
requires
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
regardless
of
the
state
statute,
that
the
jury
make
the
finding,
because
appellate
courts--
mr.
joseph
t.
mc
laughlin
--no,
it
didn't,
your
honor.
it
never
considered
the
issue.
it
was
briefed,
but
it
wasn't
reached
by
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
joseph
t.
mc
laughlin
well,
your
honor,
i
am
not
advocating
it,
and
i
would
not
push
the
federal
court,
frankly,
into
that
business,
and
as
i
say,
petitioners
never
argued
it,
it
has
never
been
an
issue
in
the
case,
and
we
certainly
don't
think
it
would
be
the
appropriate
standard
to
apply.
all
i
am
saying
is
that
i
think
judge
clark
recognized
in
his
concurring
and
dissenting
opinion
in
the
ross
case
that
there
may
be
some
other
exceptions
where
the
court
will
develop
over
time,
if
it
is
appropriate,
some
concept
of
harmless
error,
error
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
but
i
am
not
advocating
that
position,
and
i
am
not
suggesting
it
is
presented
by
this
record,
because
this
record,
if
it
presents
anything,
presents
a
sharp
dispute.
there
is
no
question
but
that
the
evidence,
even
as
construed
in
a
statutory
or
other
fashion
by
the
mississippi
supreme
court,
supports
the
conclusion
that
rickie
tucker
killed
the
deceased,
and
there
is
no
finding
and
no
suggestion
of
any
finding
anywhere,
either
by
the
jury
or
by
the
mississippi
supreme
court
that
crawford
bullock
had
any
intent
to
take
the
life
of
mark
dickson.
indeed,
the
question
here
is
whether
the
jury
must
make
one
or
more
of
the
enmund
findings
before
an
individual
convicted
of
felony
murder
may
be
sentenced
to
death
in
a
state
where
all
capital
sentence
findings
must
be
made
by
the
jury.
we
don't
seek
and
don't
believe
it
is
necessary
to
attack
in
any
way
the
holding
in
spaziano.
if
there
are
states,
as
there
are,
that
protect
and
preserve
the
role
of
the
judge
in
the
sentencing
process,
the
role
we
suggest,
which
is
a
narrow
one,
does
not
require
any
other
result.
it
simply
requires
either
that
the
case
meet
one
of
the
exceptions
that
i
outlined
or
that
the
jury
make
findings
to
push
that
defendant
across
the
constitutional
threshold
where
he
is
at
least
eligible
to
be
sentenced
to
death.
it
does
not
require
that
he
be
sentenced
to
death,
and
it
does
not
preclude
the
role
of
the
judge
in
deciding
whether
to
sentence
that
person
to
death.
indeed,
it
does
not
preclude
the
judge
from
overruling,
as
the
judge
did
in
the
florida
case
of
spaziano,
a
recommendation
by
the
jury
that
the
defendant
be
sentenced
to
life.
it
simply
says
that
you
must
have
a
finding
by
the
jury,
at
least
in
those
states
where
the
jury
must
make
all
capital
guilt
and
sentencing
findings
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
due
process.
i
think
the
jury
instructions
here
are
well
worth
spending
a
bit
of
time
on,
because
it
is
certainly
our
position,
and
we
thought
frankly
that
petitioner
had
abandoned
his
argument.
there
is
no
mention
of
it
in
his
brief.
it
is
certainly
our
position
that
the
jury
findings
here
did
not,
did
not
meet
in
any
way
the
enmund
requirements.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
jury
instructions
are
at
best
conflicting
and
at
worst
positively
misleading.
the
jury
is
told,
and
not
told
in
a
vacuum,
it
is
told
based
on
a
statute
which
defines
capital
murder
as
a
killing
when
done
with
or
without
any
design
to
effect
death
by
any
person
engaged
in
a
robbery
or
other
predicate
felony.
the
jury
was
told
by
the
prosecutor
before
it
ever
reached
the
stage
where
it
was
charged
that
we
do
not
have
to
prove
"that
he,
crawford
bullock,
killed
or
robbed
this
man.
"
"all
we
have
to
show
is
that
he
aided
and
abetted.
"
and
that
is
exactly,
i
submit,
what
the
mississippi
supreme
court
was
talking
about
when
they
talked
about
accessorial
or
aiding
and
abetting
liability.
but
when
you
come
to
the
charge,
i
think
it
is
important
to
look
at
charge
15.
it
is
repeated
in
its
entirety
on
pages
10
and
11
of
respondent's
brief
in
this
matter.
the
jury
was
not
required
to
find
that
crawford
bullock
killed
or
attempted
to
kill
or
intended
to
kill
or
contemplated
the
use
of
lethal
force.
indeed,
quite
to
the
contrary,
the
jury
was
told
that
if
mr.
bullock
did
any
act,
any
act
which
was
prior
to,
immediately
before,
leading
up
to,
connected
to
the
commission
of
the
crime,
whether
that
act
was
done
with
or
without
any
desire
to
effect
death,
then
by
consenting
to
the
killing,
by
being
there,
by
being
geographically
proximate,
if
you
will,
to
the
killing
done
by
rickie
tucker,
then
crawford
bullock
could
be
sentenced
to
death.
we
submit
that
does
not
meet
and
cannot
meet
the
enmund
standard.
it
could,
for
example,
mean
on
the
facts
of
this
case
that
the
jury
thought
it
was
enough
that
sitting
in
a
two-door
automobile,
which
this
automobile
was,
crawford
bullock
opened
the
door
at
some
point
and
rickie
tucker
stepped
out
of
the
automobile
and
chased
the
driver,
ultimately
the
victim
in
this
case,
mark
dickson
before
he
beat
him
to
death.
that
certainly,
particularly
when
it
is
told,
when
the
jury
is
told
that
it
doesn't
have
to
be
an
act
with
any
design
to
cause
death,
that,
i
submit,
would
not
meet
the
standard
of
enmund
or
any
other
standard
requiring
some
certainty
in
the
capital
sentencing
process
before
the
ultimate
punishment
of
death
is
inflicted.
the
jury
was
told,
as
counsel
for
the
petitioner
pointed
out,
in
another
instruction,
in
a
conflicting
instruction,
that
it
could
find
mr.
bullock
guilty
of
capital
murder
and
then
sentence
him
to
death
if
he
actually
killed,
but
that
instruction
was
directly
contradicted
by
the
prior
instructions,
which
said
that
intent
didn't
matter,
design
didn't
matter.
consent,
whatever
that
was,
consent
was
the
key,
and
any
overt
act
leading
up
to
the
commission
of
the
crime
by
another.
that,
i
submit,
is
not
a
sufficient
ground
for
this
jury
or
any
jury,
at
least
in
the
state
of
mississippi,
to
find
that
this
person
killed
or
attempted
to
kill
or
intended
to
kill
or
contemplated
the
use
of
lethal
force.
what
was
the
jury
to
think,
for
example,
about
the
meaning
of
the
term
"consent"?
was
it
to
think,
because
consent
is
not
defined
anywhere
in
this
charge
by
the
court,
was
it
to
think
that
it
meant
to
agree
somehow,
or
was
it
meant
to
think
that
consent
meant,
as
the
dictionary
tells
us
it
can
mean,
acquiescence,
tacit
agreement,
or
restraint
of
opposition
in
accepting
something
about
which
one
has
reservations?
mr.
bullock
was
certainly
no
hero
in
this
exercise,
but
he
had
a
cast
on
his
leg
which
was
severely
injured,
and
he
was
on
crutches.
mr.
bullock
was
struck
by
rickie
tucker
with
a
bottle,
and
his
hand
was
severely
injured.
he
was
in
the
hospital
for
a
week
after
this
incident.
he
was
not
in
any
condition,
let
us
say,
to
do
anything
necessarily.
he
said,
he
testified,
and
the
mississippi
supreme
court
said
his
testimony
was
consistent
with
his
statements
to
the
police,
and
was
the
basis
upon
which
they
recounted
the
facts
in
their
opinion.
he
said
he
yelled
at
rickie
tucker
to
stop
hitting
mark
dickson.
mr.
joseph
t.
mc
laughlin
your
honor,
no.
he
testified--
mr.
joseph
t.
mc
laughlin
--your
honor,
i
respectfully
submit
that
is
not
what
the
evidence
is.
there
was
no
dispute,
and
two
of
the
police
investigating
officers
testified
that
crawford
bullock's
statement
matched
the
facts
to
a
t.
there
was
no
blood
from
mr.
bullock,
who
was
bleeding
profusely,
found
on
the
concrete
blocks
which
were
used
to
kill
mr.
dickson
by
rickie
tucker.
there
was
no
blood
found
on
the
ground
or
in
the
depression
where
the
body
of
the
victim
lay,
despite
the
fact
that
mr.
bullock
was
bleeding
profusely.
as
justice
garwin
said,
concurring
with
the
fifth
circuit,
the
version
of
the
facts...
he
did
talk
about
the
facts,
although
the
rest
of
the
court
did
not
talk
about
the
facts
in
any
great
detail.
the
version
of
the
facts
was
perfectly
consistent
with
the
notion
that
mr.
bullock,
whether
he
intervened
as
he
testified,
to
stop
the
fight
and
was
not
successful,
or
whether
he
intervened
for
some
other
purpose,
and
there
is
no
finding
on
that
anywhere,
there
is
no
evidence
to
suggest
that
he
held
this
person
and
this
person
was
killed
when
he
was
holding
him.
indeed,
all
the
evidence
is
the
other
way,
and
the
police
so
testified.
mr.
joseph
t.
mc
laughlin
your
honor,
the--
mr.
joseph
t.
mc
laughlin
--your
honor,
the
evidence
does
show
that,
and
the
post-crime
conduct
is
something
which
juries
look
at
to
decide
whether
it
has
probative
value
all
the
time,
and
we
are
not
defending
the
conduct--
mr.
joseph
t.
mc
laughlin
--your
honor,
the
pathologist
testified
here,
and
there
was
no
dispute
about
this,
that
mr.
dickson
was
killed
almost
instantly
by
the
blow
on
the
head
from
the
cement
blocks--
mr.
joseph
t.
mc
laughlin
--your
honor,
it
is
absolutely
clear
it
was
the
cement
block.
the
bottle
disappeared.
it
was
never
found.
it
was
not
introduced
into
evidence.
the
bottle
hit
mr.
bullock
and
broke
open
the
back
of
his
hand.
he
then
retreated,
and
his
blood
was
found
first
15
feet
away
from
the
scene,
and
then
50
yards
away
from
the
scene.
he
says
he
was
running
away.
whatever
the
facts,
whatever
the
version
of
the
facts
would
be,
those
facts
were
accepted,
and
they
were
not
disputed,
your
honor,
by
the
mississippi
supreme
court
or
by
the
witnesses
who
testified
at
trial.
mr.
joseph
t.
mc
laughlin
well,
your
honor,
we
don't
know
what
the
jury
believed,
because
they
were
told
it
was
enough
if
he
did
any
overt
act
with
or
without
the
design
to
cause
death,
as
long
as
he
was
involved
in
the
robbery,
which
the
jury
found
he
was,
and
he
consented
to
the
killing,
and
i
submit
that
is
not
the
same
as
a
finding
that
he
killed,
attempted
to
kill,
intended
to
kill,
or
contemplated
the
use
of
lethal
force.
i
think
perhaps
more
importantly
than
my
submission
is
this
court's
teaching
in
francis
against
franklin
and
other
cases
that
certainly
in
this
kind
of
a
case,
in
a
death
penalty
case,
the
extreme
punishment,
that
we
have
to
be
sure
that
the
jury
found
on
a
constitutionally
permissible
basis
that
this
man
was
entitled
to
be
sentenced
to
death.
if
francis
v.
franklin
means
anything,
i
submit
it
means
that.
if
there
are
conflicting
instructions,
we
can't
allow
a
death
penalty,
the
extreme
punishment,
to
stand
in
the
face
of
the
possibility
that
the
jury
was
confused.
now,
petitioner's
counsel
referred
to
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances.
i
think
it
is
important
to
note
here
that
we
have
no
record
of
what
mitigating
circumstances
the
jury
found.
they
may
well
have
found
that
mr.
bullock
was
an
accomplish
whose
participation
was
relatively
minor.
there
is
no
written
record
of
the
mitigating
circumstances,
if
any,
found
by
this
jury.
mr.
joseph
t.
mc
laughlin
yes,
i
did,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
t.
mc
laughlin
yes.
it
was
argued.
it
was
fully
briefed.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
t.
mc
laughlin
yes,
i
believe
it
was,
because
we
certainly
argued
to
the
contrary.
mr.
joseph
t.
mc
laughlin
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
address
it.
no,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
your
honor,
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
mississippi
supreme
court
has
decided
that
the
law
as
we
urge
it,
at
least
as
it
relates
to
the
law
of
mississippi,
should
not
be
and
cannot
be
applied
retroactively.
it
is,
of
course,
our
position
that
mississippi
law
has
always
required
that
capital
sentencing
findings
be
made
by
the
jury.
that
is
what
the
statute
says.
most
recently,
your
honor,
in
a
case
which
was
not
available
to
us
when
we
filed
our
briefs.
it
is
a
case
entitled
gray
versus
the
state
of
mississippi.
it
is
found
at
472
southern
2nd
409.
the
mississippi
supreme
court
had
a
recent
opportunity
to
consider
the
enmund
findings,
the
amended
statute,
which
we
say
would
control
if
this
court
affirmed
and
sent
mr.
bullock
back
to
be
sentenced,
and
we
recognize
double
jeopardy
does
not
attach.
he
could
be
resentenced
to
death
if
the
jury
found
the
appropriate
findings.
but
in
that
case,
the
court
considered
what
would
happen
to
mr.
gray,
because
mr.
gray
had
been
convicted
and
sentenced
to
death
prior
to
the
amendment
of
the
mississippi
death
penalty
statute
requiring
the
jury
specifically
to
make
the
enmund
findings
in
the
language
of
enmund,
and
what
the
court
said,
i
think,
was
quite
instructive
at
472
southern
2nd
409.
the
court
said
that
the
instructions
given
to
the
jury
to
make
enmund...
require
the
jury
to
make
enmund
findings
because
for
gray
to
be
found
guilty
and
sentenced
to
death
he
had
to
be
found
by
the
jury
to
have
unlawfully,
wilfully,
and
feloniously,
and
of
his
malice
aforethought,
killed
and
murdered.
then
the
court
went
on
to
define
malice
aforethought
as
a
predetermination
to
commit
an
act
without
legal
justification
or
excuse.
i
submit
that
certainly
supports
the
notion
that
the
mississippi
supreme
court
would
apply
this
if
it
were
properly
presented
to
them.
he
couldn't
present
it
to
them
because
of
the
timing
of
the
decision,
but
mr.
bullock
should
be
sent
back
to
mississippi
to
be
resentenced.
thank
you.
