justice

r.
white
you
were
remanded
for
a
new
sentencing
hearing.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
lose
this
case,
there
won't
be
one,
will
there,
under
the
fifth
circuit's
present
rulings?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
there
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
appellate
court
couldn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
reason
did
they
give?
the
right
to
a
jury
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
--mr.
attorney
general,
your
argument
is
that
there
was
enough
of
a
finding
even
by
the
jury.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
one
of
your
arguments,
but
even
if
there
wasn't,
you
say
there
was
enough
of
a
finding
by
the
mississippi
supreme
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
wholly
aside
from
what
the
jury
might
have
done.
why
don't
you
just
argue
that
there
not
only
was
such
a
finding,
but
that
there
is
no
need
for
a
jury
to
decide
it?
i
guess
that
is
part
of
your
argument,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
don't
have
a
right
to
a
jury
trial--
justice
byron
r.
white
--to
make
that
kind
of
a
finding.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
a
sentencing
phase.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
could,
i
suppose,
analytically
agree
with
you
that
the
mississippi
court
could
have
made
such
a
finding,
but
that
it
didn't,
but
it
didn't
make
a
good
enough--
justice
byron
r.
white
--the
fifth
circuit
certainly
didn't
approach
it
as
that
it
was
an
element
of
the
crime.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
just
remanded
for
resentencing.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
you
call
it
a
proportionality?
why
do
you
have
to
dress
it
up
in
language
like
that?
it
is
just
that
this
is
a
finding,
a
necessary
finding
that
has
to
be
made,
but
an
appellate
court
may
make
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
just
because
there
is
no
requirement
for
a
jury
to
do
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
mean,
that
is
your
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
the
arguable
defect
in
the
jury
instruction,
at
least
in
part,
is
that
they
might
not
even,
if
you
look
at
certain
parts
of
the
instruction,
they
wouldn't
have
to
find
any
kind
of
an
intent.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
the
argument
is
that
they
might
have
understood
they
didn't
need
to
find
intent
at
all.
and
in
that
event,
if
you
approach
it
that
way,
then
the
mississippi
supreme
court
certainly
did
find
something
that
the
jury
didn't
necessarily
find.
justice
byron
r.
white
--if
the
jury
didn't
make
it,
the
supreme
court
did,
and
you
say
that
was
enough.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
thought
it
was
consistent
with
mississippi
law,
obviously.
justice
byron
r.
white
until
the
statute
was
passed.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
are
your
citations?
are
you
referring
to...
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that...
what
is
your
citation?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
what
page
was
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
okay.
justice
byron
r.
white
okay.
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
counsel,
are
you
defending
the
fifth
circuit's
opinion?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
certainly
never
addresses
the
finding
of
the
mississippi
supreme
court
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
those
words.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it
should
have?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
seems
to
me
this
leads
me
to
the
other...
suppose
that
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
mississippi
supreme
court
made
the
finding
that
enmund,
that
you...
even
you
would
concede
enmund
requires,
that
they
made
the
finding.
would
you
be
here
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
be
saying
that
the
jury
must
make
the
finding?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
say
an
appellate
court
finding,
even
though
it
reads
right
on
enmund,
just
doesn't
satisfy
the
constitution.
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
mean
it
would
be
unconstitutional
for
a
judge
to
be
authorized
to
hold
the
sentencing
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
would
be
making
these
very
findings.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
would,
if
he
was
going
to
impose
the
death
sentence
in
this.
if
a
single
judge
had
been
authorized
to
hold
a
sentencing
hearing
and
impose
the
sentence,
he
would
have
had
to
make
the
enmunds
finding
if
he
was
going
to--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
i
know,
but
mississippi
law
isn't
going
to
decide
our
constitutional
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
case
have
you
got
to
support
that
statement?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
read
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit
decisions?
do
they
say
that
the
enmund
finding
may
be
made
by
an
appellate
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
how
about
my
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
does
it...
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
did
not
even
address
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
anyway,
you
agree
that
the
eleventh
circuit
has
held
that
the
appellate
court
may
make
the
finding.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
disagree
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
appear
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
the
argument...
was
the
mississippi
supreme
court's
treatment
of
the
evidence
urged
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
terms
of
enmund?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
argued
by
your
opponent
that
the
mississippi
supreme
court's
finding
satisfied
enmund?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
yet
the
court
of
appeals
never
addressed
the
issue
at
all?
