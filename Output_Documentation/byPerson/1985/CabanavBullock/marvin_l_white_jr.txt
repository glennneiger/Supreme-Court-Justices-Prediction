mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
we
are
here
today
seeking
a
clarification
of
the
court's
holding
in
enmund
versus
florida.
this
needed
clarification
comes
about
from
what
we
contend
to
be
an
erroneous
interpretation
placed
on
inman
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
further,
there
has
developed
in
this
area
a
split
among
the
circuits
as
to
how,
when,
and
by
whom
these
enmund
criteria
findings
are
to
be
made.
the
fifth
circuit
has
held
in
several
cases,
this
being
one
of
them,
that
there
must
be
some
talismanic
jury
finding
of
the
factors
while
the
eleventh
circuit
holds
that
enmund
is
a
question
of
proportionality
and
can
be
found
from
the
record
by
an
appellate
court.
the
basic
procedural
background
of
this
particular
case
is
that
mr.
bullock
was
convicted
by
the
circuit
court
of
hines
county
in
1979.
the
conviction
and
sentence
was
affirmed
in
august
of
1980
by
the
mississippi
supreme
court.
and
then
this
court
denied
cert
in
1981.
in
this
interim
there
after
enmund
was
decided
in
1982,
the
district
court
entered
an
opinion
in
this
case
on
the
habeas
denying
the
write
of
habeas
corpus
in
june
of
1983,
and
then
the
fifth
circuit
reversed
this
court,
the
district
court,
in
1984.
the
facts,
of
course,
that
give
rise
to
this
case
are
that
on
the
night
of
september
the
21st,
1978,
the
petitioner
and
a
fellow
named
rickie
tucker
and
some
other
friends
went
to
a
night
spot
in
jackson
and
at
the
end
of
the
evening,
when
the
place
closed,
they
were
found,
bullock
and
his
friend
were
found
without
a
ride,
and
their
friends
had
left
them
there,
and
mark
dickson
offered
them
a
ride
home.
on
the
way
there,
there
developed
some
altercation
after
stopping
to
buy
a
loaf
of
bread
and
finding
none
there.
bullock
borrowed
money
from
mark
dickson.
there
developed
an
altercation
over
some
drugs
or
some
payment
for
drugs.
it
is
not
really
clear
in
the
record
what
it
is.
dickson
says,
i
don't
have
any
money.
you
can
take
my
car
as
payment.
they
got
back
in
the
car
after
this,
and
drove
a
little
further
on.
dickson
stopped
the
car
and
began
to
fight
with
rickie
tucker,
who
was
in
the
back
seat
of
the
car.
tucker
ordered
or
told
bullock
to
grab
hold
of
dickson,
which
he
did.
dickson
broke
away,
got
out
of
the
car,
ran
down
the
road,
then,
pursued
by
tucker
this
whole
time.
dickson...
i
mean,
bullock
had
a
cast
on
his
leg,
and
he
followed
these
people
down
the
road,
these
two,
and
joined
in
the
fray
again,
grabbing
bullock
by
the
hair...
i
mean
dickson
by
the
hair
of
the
head,
and
was
hit
himself
by
tucker
wielding
a
whiskey
bottle
as
he
hit
mr.
dickson
on
the
head,
cutting
his
hand.
the
evidence
shows
that
mr.
dickson
was
killed
by
having
his
skull
crushed
by
concrete
blocks,
and
then
bullock
and
dickson
disposed
of
the
body
that
night.
tucker
wanted
to
burn
the
car
and
the
body.
dickson
said
no...
i
mean,
bullock
said,
no,
let's
take
the
car.
and
they
buried...
took
the
body
and
submerged
it
in
a
lake,
bullock
wading
out
into
the
lake
with
the
cast
on
and
everything,
making
sure
the
body
was
securely
under
the
water
after
weighting
it
down
with
concrete
blocks.
now,
some
two
days
later
bullock
was
arrested
while
riding
dickson's
car.
tucker
was
also
tried
in
this
case,
and
in
the
case
there
it
went
to
a
jury
also.
the
jury
decided
in
that
case
to
give
mr.
tucker
the
life
sentence.
the
jury
in
this
case,
of
course,
imposed
the
death
penalty.
the
issues,
of
course,
are
clear.
the
fifth
circuit
holding
that
since
this
trial,
while
the
trial
jury
did
not
make
a
finding
that
mr.
bullock
intended
to
kill,
or
contemplated
that
lethal
force
would
be
used,
actually
killed
or
attempted
to
kill,
then
we
cannot
impose
the
death
penalty
on
mr.
bullock.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
yes,
they
have.
in
jones
versus
thigpen,
which
is
also
on
cert
before
this
court
right
now,
the
fifth
circuit
has
said
that
they
will
apply
it
retroactively,
and
if
there
appears
to
them
an
evidentiary
sufficiency
on
this,
or
the
state
did
not
offer
proof
on
this
particular
instance,
even
though
it
was
tried
in
a
pre-enmund
context,
that
they
will
apply
the
double
jeopardy
clause
and
forbid
us
from
retrying
them
under
bollington
in
that
case.
so,
we
are
faced
with
that
situation
in
what
we
feel
is
an
unfair
position
of
being
placed
in,
of
having
to
have
anticipated
something
that
was
not
anticipated
at
the
time
these
people
were
tried.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
in
this
case
we
were
allowed
to
go
back.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
new
sentencing
hearing,
yes.
we
were
allowed
or
told
that
we
could
go
back
and
resentence,
as
we
were
in--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--under
the
fifth
circuit's
present
ruling,
if,
depending
on
how
they...
of
course,
there
was
evidence
of
his
intent--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--offered
in
this
case.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
so
they
are
saying
that
they
don't
really
question
the
fact
that
there
was
not
intent
shown
here.
they
just
said
the
jury
didn't
make
that
finding.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
that
the
appellate
court
could
not
make
this
finding.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
the
right
to
a
jury
trial.
they
never
really
clearly
expressed
why
this
finding
had
been
made.
they
talk
about
the
fact
that
the
jury,
the
confusing
jury
instruction,
the
possibility...
and
of
course
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
there,
and
we
contend
that
this
is
a
proportionality
review,
and
not
one
that
has
to
be...
those
findings
are...
the
appellate
court
can
find
it.
the
district
court
so
held
in
this
case,
and
then
it
was,
of
course,
reversed
by
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
yes,
they
did.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
yes,
in
1984,
just
last
year,
the
legislature,
on
the
advice
of
the
attorney
general's
office,
after
the
decisions
in
the
fifth
circuit
by...
in
hart
v.
louisiana,
and
in
the
skillern
versus
estelle
and
in
the
district
courts,
we
decided
that
it
would
be,
in
order
to
stop
any
further
recourse
to
this
particular
avenue
of
complaint
about
our
death
penalty,
not...
that
it
was
constitutionally
required
or
anything,
but
just
that
this
would
forestall
one
more
complaint
we
would
have
and
one
more
layer
of
appeal
that
we
would
have
to
go
through
in
deciding
these
issues
to
impose
the
death
penalty.
so--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--the
law
now
requires
that
the
jury
on
sentence,
during
the
sentence
phase,
to
make
those
findings,
and
they
are
expressly
set
out,
just
as
they
were
set
out
in
enmund,
that
the
jury
must
find
that
he
either
killed,
attempted
to
kill,
contemplated
that
lethal
force
would
be
used,
or
intended
that
life
be
taken.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
no,
we
do
not.
no,
we
do
not
concede
that.
we
have
never
conceded
that,
and
we
hold
that
the
jury
was
properly
instructed,
and
that
in
returning
the
death
sentence
on
the
guilt
phase,
that
they
by
virtue
of
their
finding
found
that
he
actually
participated
in
the
killing
here.
the
mississippi
supreme
court
held
that
he
was
present
and
aiding
and
abetting,
aiding
and
assisting
in
the
assault
and
the
slaying
of
dickson.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
yes,
i
do.
without
his
acquisition...
we
distinguish
it
from
enmund
in
the
fact
that
enmund's
participation
was
only
shown
to
be
in
the
robbery,
whereas
here
we
have
a
participation
in
the
actual
assault
and
slaying
of
the
person.
therefore
we
distinguish
that
from
enmund,
saying
that
it
is
not
a
situation
where
enmund
applies
here
in
that
regard.
the
jury
further--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--well,
that
particular
instruction
as
instructions
are
required
to
be
read
in
the
state
of
mississippi
must
be
read
in
the
context
of
all
the
other
instructions,
and
instruction
15
makes
the
flat
requirement
that
he
must
have
killed,
and
read
in
conjunction
with
those
two,
i
think
that
that
clarifies
any
problem
there.
we
would
contend,
too,
that
the
finding
there
is
clear
enough
that
he
consented
to
and
did
act
in
furtherance
of
this
slaying.
further
on
the
sentence
phase
the
court
did
mention
in
enmund
that
it
was
not
dispositive,
but
a
matter
of
concern
that
on
the
sentence
phase
instruction,
the
jury
was
told,
as
in
this
case,
that
they
could
consider
as
a
mitigating
factor
his...
the
fact
that
he
was
an
accomplice,
and
that
his
participation
was
relatively
minor.
so,
we
have
that,
too,
that
the
jury
was
in
this
pre-enmund
context
told
to
look
at
his
participation
and
see
if
it
was
in
fact
minor,
and
that
if
it
was,
then
they
could
use
that
as
a
mitigating
circumstance
and
then
weigh
that
against
the
aggravating
circumstances
that
they--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--yes,
that
is
one
of
our
arguments.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
that
is
part
of
our
argument.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
and
sentence.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
that's
right.
that
is
the
core
of
our
argument,
that
first
and
foremost
there
is
no
right
to
a
jury
finding
or
a
jury--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--sentencing
phase
on--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--the
jury
is
not
required
to
make
the
sentencing.
therefore
this
finding
was
not
something
that
this
court
engrafted
on
as
an
element
to
the
crime
or
an
element
to
the
sentencing...
so
what
we
are
saying
is
that
the
court
there,
although
the
finding
was
a
sketchy
finding,
they
said
the
court
of
mississippi,
as
this
court
relied
on
the
finding
of
the
florida
supreme
court,
because
the
district
court
in
florida
had
found
totally
different
facts.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
it
didn't
make
a
sufficient
enough
finding.
but
then,
of
course,
we
would
ask
that
it
just
be
remanded
for
them
to
make
a
further
finding
possibly
but
that
is...
we
consider
that
the
jury
finding
there,
that
that
instruction
was
clear
enough
that
they
had...
the
jury
had
to
find
that
intent
was
there,
or
that
he--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--not
as
an
element
of
the
crime,
no.
they--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--yes,
but
with
the
requirement
the
jury
make
those
findings.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
not
that
the
court
could
do
so,
but
the
eleventh
circuit,
of
course,
has
taken
a
completely
different
approach,
and
that
is
that
it
is
a
proportionality
finding,
that
jury
findings
might
be
very--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--well,
that
is
exactly
what
we--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--well,
this
court
has
couched
it
in
terms--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--of
proportionality.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
and
solem
v.
helm
and
pully
v.
harris,
that
is
the
way
that
this
court
has
addressed
this
thing,
and
so
we
were
just
using
the
court's
own
language
there.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
well,
of
course,
our
first
position
is
that
the
finding
was
made
by
the
jury.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
even
if
it
wasn't,
even
if
that
jury
finding
has
found
that
that
finding
was...
may
be
insufficient
there
somehow,
the
supreme
court
in
its
consideration--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--well,
i
don't
think
there
is
a
lot,
other
than
just
maybe
in
a
clearer
language
than
the
jury
instruction.
the
jury
instruction
is--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--that's
true,
but
they
were
also
instructed...
they
had
to
look
at
the
instruction
as
a
whole.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
well,
possibly
so,
but
there
is
another...
our
interpretation
or
our
interpretation
of
enmund
is
that
the
court
left
us
with
four
options
there,
and
any
one
of
those
would
support
the
death
penalty,
one
of
those
being
that
he
attempted
to
kill,
and
actually
took
a
part
in
the
furtherance
of
that,
or
that
he
killed.
we
don't
read
enmund
as
requiring
that
if
someone
actually
kills,
that
he
had
to
have
an
intent
to
do
so
in
that
particular
context.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
yes,
that
has
been
their
position
both
in
this
case
and
in
redigs
and
jones,
skillern
and
hart
v.
louisiana,
all
of
those.
they
are
concerned
with
whether
the
jury
made
this
finding
there.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
well,
we
contend
that
that
finding
that
they
made
that
he
was
an
active
participant,
present,
aiding,
and
assisting
in
the
assault
and
the
slaying,
we
think
that
is
sufficient
enough
finding,
and--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--that
is
enough.
that
is
sufficient.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
it
has
been.
of
course,
this
case,
as
has
been
pointed
out,
was
tried
long
before
enmund,
so
that
was
not
in
their
mind
when
they
were
making
this
finding.
since
that
time,
on
cases
that
were
tried
pre-enmund
or
even
after
enmund
but
before
the
amendment
of
the
statute,
the
supreme
court
does
make
that
finding,
and
they
have--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--right.
certainly
they
did.
mississippi
law
does
allow
them
to
make
that
finding.
it
is
not
as
some
other
state--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--until
the
statute
was
passed,
and
we
even
had
some
cases
since
that
time
where
those--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
of
course,
in
mississippi,
the
situation
involved
we
will
have,
there
are
about
ten
cases
involved
now.
we
have
40
people
on
death
row,
and
ten
of
those
cases
are
such
that
this
case
will
impact
on
those
cases
as
to
how
this
decision
comes
out,
because
there
were
no
jury
findings
made
in
those
cases,
and
the
findings
on
enmund
were
basically
done
by
the
supreme
court
are
not
made
at
all
because
it
was
not
an
issue
raised
before
the
supreme
court.
we
would
submit
that
the
view
taken
by
the
eleventh
circuit
is
a
more...
approach
in
this
particular
context,
that
the
finding
of
an
appellate
court
on
the
record
is
done
all
the
time,
and
the
decision,
of
course,
in
ross
v.
kemp
is
totally
consistent
with
the
ruling
in
this
court
in
enmund
versus
florida.
the
basis
of
proportionality,
relying
on
the
facts
as
set
forth
here
in
florida,
throughout
the
inman
opinion
this
court
makes
it
plain
that
it
was
deciding
a
case
based
on
proportionality,
on
a
proportionality
review
of
the
record,
and
as
we
said
earlier,
later
in
solem
versus
helm,
the
same
type
of
reasoning
was
used.
each
criteria
set
forth
in
solem
versus
helm
was
supported
by
enmund
as
an
example,
and
of
course
the
argument
that
due
process
requires
in
mississippi
some
jury
finding
is
not
persuasive,
because
as
we
possibly
said
earlier,
that
spaziano
held
that
there
was
no
constitutional
right
to
a
jury
determination
of
sentence,
and
therefore
enmund
requires
only
that
the
death
penalty
cannot
be
imposed
under
the
defendant's...
unless
the
defendant's
individual
participation
justifies
it
in
the
given
case.
so,
we
look
at
these
findings
found
by
the
state,
by
the
state
supreme
court.
we
look...
the
fifth
circuit
totally
ignored
the
fact
that
in
the
sentencing
instructions,
that
they
were
given
the
mitigating
factor
that
the
defendant
was
an
accomplice
in
the
capital
offense,
and
his
participation
was
relatively
minor.
they
even
make
the
comment
in
the
opinion
that
the
state
after
this
guilt
phase
instruction
gave
no
other
instruction
that
focused
the
jury's
attention
to
his
culpability
in
this
crime
or
his
participation
in
this
crime.
and
we--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
think
i
will
attempt
to
answer
justice
stevens'
question
at
this
time.
having
reviewed
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
and
some
of
the
factors
involved
there,
we
would
answer
it
in
this
way,
that
the
jury
finding,
of
course,
was
a
general
verdict,
and
so
we
did
not
know
the
precise
parameters
of
what
they
found
there.
however,
the
mississippi
supreme
court,
its
findings
in
two
specific
instances
in
the
opinion
do
delineate
with
great
exactitude
just
what
they
found,
or
their
interpretation
of
what
the
jury
found
and
what
they
see
from
the
record,
and
those
were
in
the
context
of
evidentiary
sufficiency
on
the
claim
of
the
failure
to
grant
a
directed
verdict
as
to
manslaughter,
where
they
found
that
bullock
was
present,
aiding--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--to
the
opinion
in
the
mississippi
supreme
court.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
it
is
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
a-81
and
2.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
and
on...
the
second
reference
will
be
a-117.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
where
the
court
found
in
the
context
of
that
manslaughter
instruction
that
he
was
present,
aiding,
and
assisting
in
the
assault
upon
and
slaying
of
dickson
and
then
in
its
proportionality
review
analysis
it
again
makes
the
finding
that
the
appellant
was
an
active
participant
in
the
assault
and
homicide.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
a-117.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
right.
and
that
is
in
the
appendix
to
the--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
that
is...
the
appellant
was
an
active
participant
in
the
assault
and
homicide
committed
upon
dickson.
those
two
findings
there
would
be
what
we
would
contend
was
the
finding
of
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
in
those
cases.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--the
issue,
of
course,
here
is
not
whether
it
was
a
jury
finding,
but
whether
there
is
in
fact
evidence
in
the
record
of
intent
or
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
person
killed,
attempted
to
kill,
intended
to
kill,
or
contemplated
that
lethal
force
would
be
used.
the
opinion
in
enmund,
we
contend,
was
to
cull
out
those
people
who
did
not
have
those,
and
there
were
very
few,
as
pointed
out
in
the
opinion
in
enmund,
that
fit
into
this
category.
the
fifth
circuit,
we
contend,
has
engrafted
a
constitutional
requirement
that
these
must
be
found
by
the
jury
that
we
do
not
feel
comports
with
this
court's
opinion
in
enmund.
and
in
conclusion,
we
would
submit
that
the
view
of
determination
of
the
enmund
factors
and
criteria
used
by
the
eleventh
circuit
is
much
more
consistent
with
the
ruling
than
the
fifth
circuit
holding
that
they
must
be
made
by
a
jury.
we
would
reserve
the
remainder
of
our
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
just
a
point
or
two
to
make
some
clarifications.
the
evidence
in
the
mississippi
supreme
court...
in
the
evidence
before
the
trial
court
there
as
far
as
the
blood
and
everything,
the
testimony
was
that
they
couldn't
make
a
determination
whose
blood
that
was
on
the
rocks,
and
further,
that
we
did
not
have
these
findings
or
the
idea
of
what
these
findings,
the
specific
language
these
findings
were
to
be
made
in
until
some
two
years
after
bullock
was
decided,
three
years
after
it
was
tried.
so,
the
actual
wording
of
the
findings
of
the
mississippi
supreme
court
as
the
opponents
contend
was
not
in
the
language
of
enmund
i
don't
think
would
have
any
bearing
here.
we
do
have
a
finding
that
if
he
was
an
active
participant
and
that
active
participation
was
holding
someone
by
the
hair
of
the
head
while
somebody
else
beat
him
with
a
bottle
or
hit
him
with
a
bottle,
and
he,
of
course,
at
that
time
was
injured
himself,
and
so
we
do
contend
that
the
evidence
is
clear
that
mr.
bullock
was
right
in
the
middle
of
all
this,
and
is
certainly
a
candidate
for
the
death
penalty.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
he
was
killed
by
the
concrete
blocks
being
dropped
on
his
head.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
well,
as
a
part,
as
a
continuation
after
bullock
was
injured
by
the
bottle
hitting
his
hand
as
he
was
hitting
the
man's
head.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
the
evidence
does
not
show
so.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
yes,
he
was
the
one
who
suggested
the
place
to
get
rid
of
the
body,
the
whole
scenario
after
the
crime
of
getting
rid
of
the
body.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
well,
traditionally,
i
think
we
look
at
someone's
intent
by
their
actions
surrounding
the
crime.
we
determine
intent
when
we
don't
have...
we
very
seldom
have
the
case
where
the
guy,
a
criminal
comes
in
and
says,
yes,
i
intended
this
and
this
and
this.
in
that
case
where
we
don't
have
that,
we
have
got
to
look
at
surrounding
facts.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
yes,
sir.
