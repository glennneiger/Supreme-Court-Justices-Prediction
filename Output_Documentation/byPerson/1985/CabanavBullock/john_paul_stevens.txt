justice
john
paul
stevens
general
white,
can
i
follow
up
on
that?
because
there
is
one
part
of
your
argument
i
don't
quite
follow.
you
argue
that
there
was
a
sufficient
jury
finding
that
basically
they
were
instructed
that
if
he
was
not
an
unwilling
participant,
that
that
is
enough
of
an
element
of
intent
or
something
along
those
lines,
and
i
think
the
mississippi
supreme
court
said
something
to
the
same
effect,
that
he
was
not
an
unwilling
participant,
but
did
the
mississippi
supreme
court
say
anything
that
we
cannot
reasonably
assume
that
the
jury
itself
had
already
found?
i
mean,
do
you
argue,
in
other
words,
that
the
mississippi
supreme
court
in
effect
made
a
finding
of
fact
that
the
jury
did
not
make,
and
if
so,
just
exactly
what
was
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
i
understand,
but
even
if
it
wasn't
you
say,
well--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
what
i
am
trying
to
find
out
is,
what
is
there
in
the
supreme
court
opinion
that
goes
beyond
anything
that
we
could
reasonably
attribute
to
the
jury?
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
white,
i
won't
ask
you
to
do
it
now,
but
after
lunch
it
would
be
helpful
to
me
if
you
would
call
my
attention
to
the
portion
of
the
mississippi
supreme
court
opinion
in
which
you
think
they
made
a
finding
the
jury
did
not
make.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
would
be
helpful,
because
i
have
a
problem
with
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
mclaughlin,
it
seems
to
me
that
your
last
example
is
a
concession,
whether
you
intended
it
to
be
or
not,
that
it
is
all
right
for
a
federal
court
of
appeals
to
make
the
required
finding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
your
reason?
you
give
a
lot
of
reasons
why
the
rule
doesn't
do
much
harm
and
so
forth,
but
why
do
you
contend,
spaziano
having
been
decided
the
way
it
was,
why
do
you
contend
that
a
judge
or
appellate
court
may
not
make
a
required
finding?
what
is
the
reason
for
your
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
your
answer
is,
it
is
a
matter
of
mississippi
law,
this
is
the
appropriate
factfinder
on
this
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
mississippi
had
a
different
law,
you
might
not--
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
see
how
they
could
make
that
argument
and
then
say
there
are
some
cases
that
are
so
clear
that
we
sitting
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
federal
collateral
review
status
in
effect--
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
white,
could
i
just
ask
you,
because
i
am
a
little
confused
on
it,
is
it
correct,
as
your
opponent
says,
that
the
evidence
is
also
clear
that
he
was
not
killed
by
the
bottle,
but
he
was
killed
by
the
concrete
block?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
happened
after
the
striking
with
the
bottle.
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
bullock
have
any
part
in
the
act
of
hitting
with
the
concrete
block?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
consider...
i
am
sure
there
are
very
persuasive
facts,
and
there
are
certainly
very
troublesome
facts,
but
are
they
relevant
to
the
enmund
issue,
the
post-death
facts
of
the
way
they
disposed
of
the
body?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
just
want
to
be...
you
are
suggesting
that
the
post-death
facts
tend
to
substantiate
the
conclusion
that
bullock
intended
the
death
to
occur.
