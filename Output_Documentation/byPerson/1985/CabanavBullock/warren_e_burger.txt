you

chief

chief

e.

mr.
white,
you
may
resume
your
argument.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
mclaughlin.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
you
place
in
this
whole
panorama
of
the
findings
with
respect
to
the
overwhelming
evidence?
you
are
addressing
primarily
the
charge,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
eighty-one?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
not
quite
sure
what
your
point
is
about
what
you
have
just
read.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
are
merely
stating
a
general
proposition
of
mississippi
law,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
the
top
of
117
and
page
81?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
statement
from
the
court
on
page
117
is
not
a
general
statement
of
law.
they
are
statements
with
respect
to
the
evidence
on
this
record,
on
the
record
then
before
them.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then,
what
did
they
mean
when
they
said
the
evidence
is
overwhelming
that
appellant
was
an
active
participant
in
the
assault
and
homicide
committed
upon
mark
dickson,
and
so
forth?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
we
reading
the
same
page
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
may
i
read
it
to
you?
"when
the
evidence",
and
i
assume
they
are
referring
to
the
record,
"is
overwhelming
that
appellant
was
an
active
participant
in
the
assault
and
homicide.
"
that
is
not
a
general
statement
of
law.
it
isn't
a
statement
of
law
at
all.
it
is
a
statement
of
what
the
record
told
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
they
didn't
say
he
was
present.
they
didn't
say
that
at
all.
they
said
he
was
an
active
participant.
i
am
confused
about--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--i
think
we
need
an
interpreter
here,
because
what
i
read
in
the
english
language
here
isn't
what
you
are
telling
us.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
go
back
to
81.
this
is
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
speaking,
their
evaluation
of
the
record.
the
evidence
is
overwhelming
that
appellant
was
present,
aiding,
and
assisting
in
the
assault
upon
and
the
slaying
of
dickson,
and
in
removing
and
discarding
his
wallet
and
the
personal
effects
and
so
forth,
disposing
of
his
body.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--but
he
was
holding
him
in
the
meantime
so
that
he
could
be
hit
with
the
bottle,
wasn't
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
what
the
evidence
is.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
difference
would
it
make
whether
he
died
when
he
was
holding
him
or
five
minutes
or
later
or
an
hour
later?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
evidence
also
shows,
and
is
not
disputed,
that
he
helped
tie
the
concrete
blocks
on
the
body
to
sink
it
into
the
lake.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
can't
even
be
sure
that
the
fellow
was
dead
by
that
time.
he
might
have
still
been
alive.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
which
was
it,
the
bottle
or
the
cement
block?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
obviously
the
jury
didn't
believe
him
when
he
said
he
was
running
away.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
white?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
see.
it
does
show
that
he
helped
use
the
concrete
block
to
tie
him
up
with
a
hose
so
that
his
body
would
sink.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
