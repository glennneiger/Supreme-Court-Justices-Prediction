justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
white,
has
the
fifth
circuit
since
its
decision
in
this
case
ever
had
presented
to
it
the
question
of
whether
the
state
might
go
back
and
attempt
to
retry
on
this
issue,
whether
that
might
be
double
jeopardy
of
some
sort?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
the
fifth
circuit's
position,
i
think,
was
that
because
of
the
instructions
to
the
jury
in
the
trial
court,
although
there
might
have
been
evidence
that
would
have
supported
the
same
finding
that
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
made,
the
jury
might
not
have
made
that,
might
not
have
made
that
finding.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
i
don't
think
it
is
entirely
accurate
to
say
that
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
did
nothing
that
we
know
for
sure
the
jury
did--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--the
fifth
circuit
didn't
rely
on
mississippi
law,
did
it?
