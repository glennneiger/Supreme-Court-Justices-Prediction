justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
white,
in
mississippi
the
law
requires
the
jury
to
make
all
the
findings
necessary
both
for
guilt
and
sentencing.
is
that
correct?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
has
the
mississippi
law
been
amended
since
this
case
arose
with
regard
to
enmund?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
would
the
law
now
require?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
concede
that
the
jury
findings
in
this
case
were
inadequate
to
meet
enmund?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it
is
your
position
that
someone
who
was
present
and
who
does
some
overt
act
at
the
time
of
the
killing
to
assist
meets
any
enmund
requirement
without--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
the
jury
instruction
was
a
little
confusing,
was
it
not,
when
it
said
first
that
the
jury
had
defined
that
bullock,
while
acting
in
concert
and
while
present
at
the
time
and
place
by
consenting
to
the
killing,
and
then
went
on
to
say
that
whether
or
not
it
was
done
with
a
design
to
effect
the
death.
how
do
you
reconcile--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it
is
enough
under...
as
a
matter
of
mississippi
law
as
well
if
the
jury
doesn't
make
the
finding?
