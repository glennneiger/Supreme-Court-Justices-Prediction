mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
defendants
in
this
case
were
apprehended
in
november,
1975,
illegally
transporting
dynamite
and
firearms.
they
have
thus
far
successfully
avoided
trial
by
filing
an
extensive
series
of
pretrial
motions.
in
1983,
the
district
court
dismissed
the
indictment
on
the
ground
that
the
accrued
delay
violated
the
speedy
trial
clause
of
the
sixth
amendment.
a
divided
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
dismissal,
and
we
are
here
on
certiorari
for
a
review
of
that
decision.
the
defendants
were
arrested
while
traveling
in
a
motor
home
and
a
station
wagon.
in
the
station
wagon
were
350
pounds
of
dynamite,
several
time
bombs,
and
a
loaded
revolver.
in
the
motor
home
were
blasting
caps,
more
than
2,000
rounds
of
ammunition,
several
empty
hand
grenades,
and
eight
firearms
with
chliterated
serial
numbers.
the
defendants
were
promptly
indicted
on
charges
of
unlawful
possession
and
transportation
of
explosives
and
firearms.
following
their
indictment,
the
defendants
began
filing
numerous
pretrial
motions.
one
motion
sought
suppression
of
evidence
of
the
dynamite
which
had
been
destroyed
by
state
law
enforcement
officials.
the
district
court
granted
the
motion
to
suppress.
the
government
appealed
the
suppression
order,
but
the
defendants
in
the
district
court
sought
to
force
the
government
to
go
to
trial
without
the
suppressed
evidence
while
the
appeal
was
pending.
the
defendants
did
not
ask
for
and
the
district
court
did
not
order
a
severance
of
the
dynamite
and
firearms
counts.
when
the
government
declined
to
go
to
trial
without
the
suppressed
evidence,
the
district
court
dismissed
the
indictment
with
prejudice
under
rule
48(b)
for
what
it
termed
unnecessary
delay.
the
government
appealed,
and
its
appeal
was
consolidated
with
that
from
the
suppression
order.
the
defendants
were
completely
free
of
all
restraints
during
the
appeal.
a
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
initially
affirmed,
but
the
court
of
appeals
reheard
the
case
en
banc
and
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
in
comprehensive
majority
and
concurring
opinions,
the
court
of
appeals
set
forth
guiding
rules
for
cases,
criminal
cases
in
which
evidence
has
been
lost
or
destroyed.
the
defendants
unsuccessfully
sought
rehearing
and
certiorari
on
an
interlocutory
basis.
when
the
case
returned
to
the
district
court
in
1980,
the
defendants
resumed
their
motion
practice.
they
successfully
required
the
government
to
reindict,
and
they
sought
a
number
of
extensions
of
time
in
which
to
file
further
pretrial
motions.
at
one
time
almost
two
dozen
of
these
motions
were
pending.
the
district
court
granted
the
defendant's
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
on
grounds
of
vindictive
prosecution
as
to
defendant
ka
mook
banks,
and
denied
the
vindictive
prosecution
motions
of
the
other
defendants.
both
sides
appealed.
once
again
the
defendants
were
free
of
all
restraints
during
the
appeal.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
during
the
second
appeal,
as
far
as
i
am
aware,
they
were
not
under
travel
restrictions,
justice
blackmun.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
of
any
kind.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
no,
it
is
not.
during
the
first
appeal
as
well
it
is
quite
clear
from
the
record
that
the
bombs
were
exonerated.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
the
defendant
can
be
incarcerated.
the
defendant
can
also
be
subject
to
bail,
travel
restrictions,
reporting
restrictions,
and
the
like.
the
defendants
were
not
in
this
case,
justice
o'connor.
the
court
of
appeals
issued
its
opinion
shortly
after
this
court's
opinions
in
united
states
versus
goodwin
and
united
states
versus
hollywood
motor
car,
which
were
dispositive
of
the
issues
raised
on
the
appeals.
once
again,
it
ruled
in
favor
of
the
government.
it
reversed
the
dismissal
of
the
indictment
as
to
ka
mook
banks,
and
it
dismissed
the
appeals
of
the
other
defendants.
once
again,
the
defendant
sought
rehearing
and
certiorari,
entailing
another
several
months
of
delay.
on
remand
in
the
district
court
in
1983,
the
defendants
continued
to
file
additional
motions.
this
time
the
district
court
dismissed
the
indictment
on
speedy
trial
grounds,
and
the
government
appealed.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
dismissal
on
this
appeal.
it
purported
to
excuse
certain
periods
of
the
delay
that
had
taken
place,
but
it
ultimately
counted
the
entire
75
months
that
the
case
had
been
pending
on
appeal
as
part
of
the
delay,
and
had
found
that
this
length
of
the
delay
was
"the
most
weighty
factor
by
far.
"
in
its
balancing
of
the
relevant
factors.
judge
wallace
dissented
from
the
court
of
appeals
decision
on
the
basis
of
this
court's
second
decision
in
united
states
versus
mcdonald,
which
he
reasoned
required
exclusion
of
the
time
on
appeal
when
the
defendants
were
not
under
indictment.
there
are
two
basic
points
that
i
would
like
to
make.
first,
wholly
apart
from
how
appeal
time
should
as
a
general
matter
be
analyzed
under
the
speedy
trial
clause,
it
would
make
a
mockery
of
the
sixth
amendment
to
hold
that
these
defendants
have
been
denied
their
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
nothing
could
be
plainer
than
that
far
from
seeking
a
speedy
trial,
they
were
doing
everything
in
their
power
to
avoid
one.
they
have
filed
literally
dozens
of
pretrial
motions.
the
docket
sheets
alone
fill
most
of
the
joint
appendix.
among
these
filings
were
a
motion
for
appointment
of
a
native
american
judge,
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
in
part
on
the
ground
that
persons
with
hearing
impairments
have
been
excluded
from
the
grand
jury,
and
a
motion
arguing
that
the
defendant's
right
to
a
public
trial
would
be
violated
unless
they
were
tried
in
a
facility
larger
than
any
of
the
available
courtrooms.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
i
am
not
sure.
a
number
of
motions
were
disposed
of--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--i
am,
and--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--it
would
not
take
much
time
to
decide
motions
such
as
those,
justice
stevens,
but
the
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
they
have
been
using
these
motions
in
an
attempt
to
avoid
trial,
and
i
would
like
to
point
to
two
motions,
two
filings
in
particular.
first,
the
completely
meritless
certiorari
petitions
that
the
defendants
filed
following
the
second
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals,
notwithstanding
that
controlling
decisions
had
recently
been
issued
by
this
court.
those
petitions
took
several
months
to
dispose
of,
even
though
they
were--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--several
years
have
passed
while
the
case
was
in
the
court
of
appeals,
but
i
think
that
the
defendant's
motion
practice
clearly
indicates
that
what
they
wanted
was
not
a
speedy
trial,
but
to
avoid
trial,
justice
stevens,
and
indeed
i
would
like
to
focus,
perhaps
most
telling
of
all,
on
the
motion
that
is
the
subject
of
this
court's
review
now,
and
that
is
their
speedy
trial
motion.
on
the
last
remand,
the
defendants
did
not
ask
for
a
speedy
trial.
they
asked
once
again
that
the
indictment
be
dismissed.
the
defendants
could
have
fully
preserved
their
claim
of
a
speedy
trial
violation
until
after
trial,
when
such
claims
are,
as
this
court
has
held,
best
considered.
but
instead
they
raised
and
sought
a
decision
on
their
claim
before
trial,
adding
perhaps
another
three
years
to
the
delay
before
they
can
be
tried
should
this
court
reverse.
delays
such
as
this,
we
would
submit,
cannot
be
laid
at
the
door
of
the
government.
now,
to
rebut--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--it
can
be,
justice
rehnquist,
but
not
under
these
circumstances,
and
i
would
point
out
that
the
delay
on
the
first
appeal
before
the
court
of
appeals
was
something
in
the
neighborhood
of
three
years,
and
this
entailed
briefing
an
argument
before
a
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals,
a
divided
panel
decision,
rehearing
en
banc,
a
remand
to
the
district
court
for
further
factfinding,
and
the
issuance
of
a
number
of
opinions
that
take
up
more
than
50
pages
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
it
was
a
long
time,
justice
rehnquist,
but
i
would
suggest
that
it
is
not
a
completely
unreasonable
amount
of
time,
given--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--well,
justice
o'connor,
we
don't
contend
that
time
on
appeal
should
under
all
circumstances
be
excluded
under
barker
versus
wingo,
but
under--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--the
problem,
justice
o'connor,
is
that
time
on
appeal
necessarily
is
going
to
be
of
greater
length
than
is
time
in
the
district
court,
and
it
will
be
more
routinely
justifiable,
and
when
you
plug
that
into
the
test
that
the
lower
courts
have
developed
under
barker,
which
generally
entails
a
finding
of
presumptive
prejudice
after
anywhere
from
six
months
to
a
year
to
a
little
more
than
that,
you
are
inevitably
going
to
skew
the
balance,
and
that
is
exactly
what
happened
here.
you
are
going
to
lead
the
courts
to
find
violations
when
they
should
not
be,
and
you
are
going
to
create
a--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--justice
blackmun,
the
government
filed
its
appeals
on
an
expedited
basis
under
the
court
of
appeals
rules,
but
i
would
note
that
the
defendants
did
not
do
anything
either
while
the
cases
were
pending,
and
i
would
think
it
would
be
incumbent
upon
them--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
district
courts,
of
course,
have
different
functions,
justice
rehnquist.
they
do
typically
rule
faster,
and
they
are
not
required
to
formulate
binding
precedential
rules
for
other
cases.
i
think
the
very
institutional
functions
of
the
different
courts
would
suggest
that
the
court
of
appeals
would
require
a
more
lengthy
period
of
time.
moreover,
when
a
defendant
files
a
pretrial
motion
such
as
the
motions
in
this
case,
he
must
be
taken
to
contemplate
the
amount
of
time
that
will
be
necessary
to
resolve
the
motion
and
to
resolve
an
appeal
should
one
be
necessary,
but
suggests
that
in
that
context,
the
delay
cannot
be
counted
against
the
government.
the
defendant
must
be
taken
to
have
foreseen
it.
and
the
problem
is,
you
will
be
creating
a
litigable
claim
of
error
every
time
there
is
a
pretrial
appeal.
i
would
note
in
this
very
case
that
the
defendants
represented
that
if
this
court
reverses,
they
will
file
another
speedy
trial
motion
on
remand
in
the
district
court
seeking
dismissal
once
again.
this
appeal
has
not
proceeded
in
an
unduly
slow
fashion,
yet
this
is
the
kind
of
claim,
this
is
the
kind
of
problem
that
is
created
by
the
court
of
appeals'
balancing
of
the
factors
in
this
case.
i
would
note
in
particular
that
the
federal
courts
have
had
relatively
little
experience
with
the
speedy
trial
clause
since
the
effective
date
of
the
speedy
trial
act,
and
believe
that
inexperience
is
demonstrated
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
in
this
case.
the
court
purported
to
exclude
certain
amounts
of
time
to
excuse
it,
to
weigh
it
neutrally,
to
weigh
it
against
no
one,
but
in
the
end,
it
simply
put
all
of
the
appeal
time
back
into
the
balance,
and
the
amount
of
time
that
is
typically
taken
on
appeals
will,
i
think,
inevitably
skew
the
balance
in
this
fashion
toward
a
finding
of
a
violation.
the
very
least
reasonable
amounts
of
time
on
appeal
must
be
excluded
when
the
balance
is
undertaken
under
barker
versus
wingo.
we
note
as
well
that
under
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
versus
mcdonald
once
the
indictment
has
been
dismissed,
and
once
the
defendants
are
not
actually
held
to
answer
a
criminal
charge,
the
speedy
trial
clause
does
not
apply.
that
was
the
situation
in
this
case.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
we
believe
the
principle
of
mcdonald,
the
guiding
principle,
justice
blackmun,
is
that
once
the
indictment
has
been
dismissed--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--i
don't
believe--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--i
don't
believe
that
that
is
quite
accurate.
the
indictment
was
dismissed
in
mcdonald
by
a
quasi-judicial
military
officer
for...
on
a
finding
of
lack
of
evidence
to
prosecute.
the
government
military
prosecutor
in
that
case
did
want
to
go
forward,
and
the
charges
were
dismissed
over
his
opposition.
so
we
do
not
believe
that
that
distinction
is
a
viable
one,
nor
would
we
think
that
there
is
any
policy
reason
to
distinguish
on
that
basis.
certainly,
as
the
court
noted
in
united
states
versus
marion,
the
very
fact
that
the
government's
desire
to
proceed
with
charges
against
a
defendant
is
a
matter
of
public
record,
as
it
was
in
marion,
and
i
believe
may
have
been
in
mcdonald
as
well,
is
no
reason
in
itself
for
the
speedy
trial
clause
to
apply.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
in
this
case
he
is
not
being...
the
defendants
were
not
being--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--we
could
have
arrested,
and
we
could
have--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--that
is
right,
justice
white.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
if
he
is
put
on
bail,
than
he
is
held
to
answer.
the
fact
is--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--i
believe
that
is
what
would
be
done,
or
required
him
to
appear
before
the
judge.
the
fact
is--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--he
was
not
under
arrest.
his
bonds
had
been
exonerated.
it
is
quite
clear
in
the
record
that
that
is
what
had
happened.
the
truth
is,
the
case
is
pending,
and
if
the
government
prevails
on
its
appeal,
the
indictment
will
be
reinstated,
but
the
fact
is,
during
the
appeal
itself,
there
is
no
indictment,
and
these
defendants
were
not
being
held.
now,
in
many
circumstances--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--there
is
an
appeal
pending.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
that
is
true,
justice
blackmun,
but
i
am
not
sure
that
the
distinction
makes
any
difference.
after
all--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--had
the
indictment
been
dismissed
on
some
technicality
in
terms
of
the
indictment
process
itself,
the
government
would
have
had
the
choice
of
returning
to
the
grand
jury
and
seeking
a
new
indictment,
in
which
case,
under
mcdonald,
the
speedy
trial
clause
indisputably
would
not
have
applied,
but
going
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
seeking
reinstatement
of
the
old
one,
we
do
not
think
that
there
is
any
functional
difference
between
those
two
courses
of
action
for
purposes
of
the
speedy
trial
clause.
these
defendants
were
free
of
their
restraints.
they
were
not
under
indictment
at
the
time.
and--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--yes,
he
would,
justice--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--that
is
true.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
that
is
my
argument,
and
i
believe
that
is
a
fair
reading
of
the
court's
cases,
justice
stevens.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
no,
i
think,
justice
o'connor,
once
any
sort
of
restraint
has
been
imposed
to
hold
the
defendant
to
answer
a
criminal
charge,
that
that
would
trigger
the
speedy
trial
clause's
applicability
under--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--i
believe
that
that
is
the
result
of
this
court's
decision
in
dillingham,
in
which
the
defendant
was
released.
but
that
is
simply
not
this
case,
and
for
the
reasons
that
i
suggested
earlier,
even
where
the
speedy
trial
clause
does
apply,
we
do
not
believe
that
times
such
as
this
can
normally
lead
to
a
speedy
trial
clause
violation.
what
i
would
suggest
as
the
general
rule
for
the
court
is
that
in
the
absence
of
exceptional
circumstances,
more
than
just
time,
more
than
just
delay,
something
more
must
be
required
to
trigger
the
full
balancing
test
under
barker
versus
winco.
it
can't
just
be
the
amount
of
time
that
has
taken
place
on
an
appeal.
if
the
defendant
is
incarcerated,
if
the
defendant
can
make
a
showing
of
prejudice,
if
the
defendant
has
attempted
to
obtain
a
ruling
from
the
court
of
appeals,
those
are
the
sorts
of
factors
the
courts
should
look
at
first,
not
just
the
amount
of
time,
because
when
you
just
look
at
the
amount
of
time,
you
are
going
to
have
a
problem
as
you
did
in
this
case.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
response
to
justice
white's
question,
it
is
quite
clear
why
congress
excluded
appeal
time
under
the
speedy
trial
act.
we
cite
the
legislative
history
at
page
20
in
our
brief.
congress
said
it
would
indeed
be
anomalous
to
permit
the
defendant
to
benefit
from
delay
properly
undertaken
to
protect
his
interest
in
a
fair
adjudication
of
the
charges
against
him
by
allowing
dismissal
without
exclusion
of
that
time.
that
is
quite
clear.
the
lynchpin
of
the
defendant's
argument
here
is
that
they
said
on
may
12th,
1976,
we
are
ready
to
go
to
trial.
we
are
ready
to
stand
or
fall
under
barker
versus
wingo
on
this
court's
analysis
and
interpretation
of
that
request.
the
dynamite
had
been
suppressed.
the
defendant
sought
to
force
us
to
go
to
trial
without
that
evidence.
that
is
a
trial
that
would
have
taken
about
two
minutes.
a
jury
would
have
been
empaneled,
and
judgment
of
acquittal
would
have
been
entered.
as
far
as--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--the
dynamite
had
been
destroyed
by
state
officials
who
had
custody
of
it.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
secondary
evidence
of
the
dynamite.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
there
were
photographs
of
it
and
the
like.
the
defendants
did
not
want
a
severance.
they
made
clear
at
page
9
of
their
brief
in
footnote
13,
they
say,
"as
in
1976,
these
indigent
defendants
did
not
want
their
resources
taxed
by
the
need
to
defend
two
separate
trials.
"
they
wanted
us
to
go
to
trial,
one
trial,
without
that
evidence.
plainly
that
is
something
we
could
not
have
been
in
a
position
to
do.
i
think
their
hypocritical
statements
that
they
wanted
to
go
to
trial
at
that
time
plainly
are
unworthy
of
any
weight
under
barker
versus
wingo.
i
want
to
emphasize
as
well
that
regardless
of
how
appeal
time
is
treated
under
barker,
as
far
as
the
analysis
of
the
four
factors
goes,
cannot
be
plainer
that
these
defendants...
that
the
speedy
trial
clause
was
not
violated
in
this
case.
when
you
examine
the
absence
of
requests
for
a
speedy
trial,
absence
of
a
true
desire
for
a
speedy
trial,
the
absence
of
prejudice,
any
prejudice
at
this
time
is
wholly
speculative.
they
refer
to
the
deaths
of
witnesses.
they
don't
mention
that
these
are
government
witnesses.
i
think
that...
and
the
reasons
for
the
delay
here,
the
need
for
the
appellate
court
to
have
an
en
banc
ruling
determination
of
a
very
important
issue
involving
the
loss
and
destruction
of
evidence,
i
think
you
can't
be
clear
that
the
balance
comes
out
that
way.
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
i
think
you
are
going
to
have
a
real
problem
with
general
significance,
justice
stevens,
if
you
affirm
the
manner
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
undertook
the
balancing
test.
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
does
not
balance
the
factors
in
the
same
manner.
this
is
the
first
case
we
have
seen
that
has
in
our
view
wholly
misread
the
balancing
test,
and
i
believe
if
you--
mr.
bruce
n.
kuhlik
--we
do
believe
it
is
incorrect,
justice
stevens.
i
point
out
another
important
aspect
of
the
defendant's
argument
seems
to
be
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
as
a
general
matter
truly
expedite,
truly
hurry
through
the
pretrial
appeals.
and
i
point
out
that
especially
under
the
new
bail
act
that
defendants
in
post-conviction
appeals
are
going
to
typically
be
under
far
greater
prejudicial
restraints
than
are
defendants
in
pretrial
appeals
such
as
the
ones
in
this
case.
and
to
totally
neglect
them
simply
to
hurry
through
on
the
pretrial
appeals
i
think
would
be
a
big
mistake.
i
would
also
point
out
that
out
of
the
six
years
or
so
that
this
case
was
on
appeal,
one
year
of
that
time
has
to
be
attributed
solely
to
the
defendants,
their
completely
frivolous
rehearing
and
cert
petitions
after
the
second
appeal,
and
indeed,
their
cert
petitions
after
the
first
appeal.
at
that
point,
the
case
was
in
precisely
the
same
posture
it
would
have
been
in
had
the
district
court
denied
their
motions
to
suppress.
it
was
interlocutory.
those
are
claims
just
like
the
speedy
trial
claim
that
is
the
subject
here
that
can
be
preserved
until
after
trial.
they
did
not
move
on
this
last
remand
for
a
speedy
trial.
they
moved
again
for
a
dismissal.
i
also
point
out
that
the...
on
the
first
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
certainly
did
rule
in
favor
of
the
government.
it
reversed
the
with
prejudice
aspect
of
the
dismissal,
which
of
course
was
the
only
thing
that
really
mattered.
and
finally,
on
the
remand
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
in
the
district
court,
we
would
simply
submit,
as
we
explained
in
our
reply
brief,
that
being
ordered
to
appear
at
a
hearing
like
that
is
not
the
kind
of
restraint
that
we
think
would
implicate
the
speedy
trial
clause
of
macdonald.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
