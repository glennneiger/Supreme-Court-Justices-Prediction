was
that
different
for
the
first?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
constraints
are
possible
to
be
imposed
on
a
defendant
when
the
indictment
is
involuntarily
dismissed?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
kuhlik,
why
shouldn't
that
at
least
be
one
of
the
considerations
that
should
be
weighed
under
the
barker
v.
wingo
factors
rather
than
some
automatically
excluded
period
of
time?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
doesn't
it
make
sense
to
just
always
consider
it,
because
after
all,
the
appellate
court
is
an
arm
of
government
just
like
the
trial
court,
and
why
shouldn't
it
just
go
into
the
factors?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
why
aren't
the
concerns
basically
the
same?
and
maybe
the
courts
of
appeal
need
to
be
reminded
that
they
should
move
along
with
these
things?
did
the
government
ever
do
anything
about
expediting
movement
in
the
court
of
appeals?
we
get
a
lot
of
prisoners'
cases
here
who
attempt
to
bring
or
seek
writs
of
mandamus
to
get
them
to
act.
did
the
government
do
anything
at
all
about
moving
along?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
would
the
court
do
if
just
some
minor
restraint
were
imposed,
you
can't
leave
the
country,
or
you
can't
leave
the
state,
or
something
like
that?
then
we
would
have
to
go
through
a
long
period
of
inquiry
as
to
how
many
restraints
make
it
different,
wouldn't
we?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
any
restraint,
no
matter
how
small?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
is
an
indication,
is
there
not,
in
the
record
that
there
were
a
number
of
instances
in
which
counsel
for
the
defendants
below
indicated
less
than
a
sincere
desire
to
push
on
for
trial.
although
language
was
articulated
on
occasion
that
we
want
to
go
to
trial,
it
was
sometimes
done
in
the
context
of
when
the
appeal
was
pending,
so
it
couldn't
go
to
trial.
how
do
you
justify
that
part
of
the
barker-wingo
factors?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
because
it
doesn't
look
too
sincere
at
times
and
in
places
in
the
record.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
the
government's
attorney
correct
that
if
you
should
lose
in
this
case
before
this
court
that
then
there
would
be
an
intention
to
file
a
motion
for
another
speedy
trial
violation
because
of
the
time
taken
by
this
court?
