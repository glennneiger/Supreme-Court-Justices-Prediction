justice
harry
a.
blackmun
does
that
mean
that
they
could
have
left
the
country?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
of
any
kind?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
your
answer
is
in
the
negative.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
i
am
trying
to
do
is
to
tie
this
into
justice
o'connor's
question
of
isn't
it
a
factor
to
consider
in
the
barker
and
wingo
balance?
it's
a
factor
to
be
considered
properly,
and
our
main
point,
i
suppose,
that
i
would
like
to
get
across,
is
simply
that
appellate
time
is
different
from
trial
time.
the
ways
that
would
require
justification
if
they
took
place
in
the
district
court
do
not
require
justification
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
this
time
also
must
be...
the
context
in
which
the
time
arises.
why
should
that
be,
mr.
kuhlik?
why
should
delays
in
the
court
of
appeals
not
require
justification
even
though
the
same
delays
in
the
district
court
were
not,
because
district
courts
usually
rule
faster
than
appellate
courts?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes,
but
certainly
mcdonald
is
distinguishable,
isn't
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
was
a
voluntary
dismissal
by
the
government.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
here
is
an
involuntary
one.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--but
at
least
there
is
an
appeal
pending.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
which
was
not
true
in
mcdonald.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
to
use
your
misused
word,
i
don't
think
it
is
viable.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
stern,
the
government
attempted
to
expedite
the
appeal
on
the
vindictive
prosecution
aspect,
didn't
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
did
it
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
my
real
question
is,
did
you
oppose
that?
