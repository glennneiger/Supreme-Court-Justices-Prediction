mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
it
was
nine
years
and
363
days
ago
that
this
case
began,
and
it
has
been
pending
in
the
federal
courts
ever
since.
the
issue--
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
--your
honor,
the
facts
of
this
case
show
that
these
accused
people
were
ready
for
trial
on
may
12th,
1976.
it
demanded
a
speedy
trial
on
that
date.
the
government
refused
to
proceed,
and
that
resulted
in
a
dismissal
that
was
upheld
on
appeal.
the
sanction
of
the
dismissal--
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
--well,
after
the
new
indictment,
there
was
a
government
appeal
and
a
defense
appeal,
and
that
consumed
time
also,
but
the
real
result
in
this
case
is
that
we
were
ready
for
trial
back
in
1976,
and
the
government
was
not,
and
that
was
the
act
that
gave
all
the
resulting
delay.
the
issue
for
this
court
today
as
i
see
it
is
whether
the
appellate
court
should
be
held
immune
from
the
speedy
trial
clause
of
the
sixth
amendment.
the
sixth
amendment
provides
that
any
person
charged
with
a
crime
shall
be
given
a
trial
without
undue
delay,
and
the
government
urges
that
this
court
hold
that
appellate
delay,
no
matter
how
long,
no
matter
in
what
circumstance,
is
incapable
as
a
matter
of
law
from
being
undue
or
unnecessary.
we
believe
such
an
unflexible
standard
is
incompatible
with
the
test
announced
by
this
court
in
barker-wingo
and
is
irreconcilable
with
the
protections
of
the
concerns
underlying
the
speedy
trial
clause,
that
a
speedy
trial
be
provided
to
defendant
because
lack
of
such
a
speedy
trial
will
harm
him,
his
defense,
and
the
courts,
and
society
as
well.
the
government
seems
to
suggest
to
this
court
that
the
barker
test
is
incapable
of
accurately
balancing
the
interests
in
a
case
of
appellate
delay.
we
disagree.
we
think
that
the
appellate
delay
is
not
so
different
from
any
other
type
of
delay
that
it
cannot
be
adequately
considered
under
the
reasons
for
delay
factor.
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
certainly,
justice
powell.
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
i
think
that
there...
under
the
barker
test,
a
district
court
judge
is
going
to
make
the
determination
can--
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
--i
think
a
district
court
judge
would
say
that
there
is
a
valid
reason
for
the
delay
of
a
case
in
front
of
this
court,
and
that
that
amount
of
time,
i
would
submit,
is
appropriate.
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
i
don't
think
that
that
type
of--
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
--i
think
when
you
get
to
the
point
of
a
delay
in
this
case,
which
is
sometimes
one
part
almost
two
years--
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
--right.
i
am
saying
that
a
district
court
judge
can
look
at
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
i
don't
think
that
anybody
can
say
that
a
particular
case
six
months
is
okay,
eight
months
isn't.
but
i
think
you
can
say
that
under
the
district
court's
discretion
they
could
look
at
the
length
of
delay
and
the
circumstances
of
the
case
and
balance
the
factors
with
all
the
other
circumstances.
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
no,
i
think
if
there
was
a
circumstance
with
more
than
enough
delay
to
raise
the
issue,
district
court
judges
would
weigh
that
delay
in
the
particular
case
and
that
particular
circumstance.
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
i
think
it
is
a
hard
decision
to
make
in
some
close
cases,
but
i
think
in
a
case
like
this
where
you
have
had
two
appeals
in
some
six
and
half
years,
it
isn't
so
hard.
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
i
think
the
ruling
from...
the
holding
from
this
court
hopefully
will
make
it
so
that
it
need
not
happen.
i
don't
know.
i
think
it
is
a
hard
thing
as
a
practical
matter
for
a
district
court
judge
to
do
that.
but
i
think
the
appellate
courts
on
their
own
could
make
that
ruling
quicker
so
that
it
need
not
happen.
i
don't
know
if
a
district
court
judge
could
do
it
as
a
practical
matter.
i
think
it
would
be
a
very,
very
rare
district
court
judge
that
would
try
to
do
that.
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
what
happened
under
the
ninth
circuit
rule
is,
anything
that
the
government
did--
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
--no,
the
rule
did,
your
honor.
what
happened
is,
neither
side
has
to
expedite
it,
and
according
to
the
ninth
circuit
rule
20,
when
you
file
an
appeal,
a
government
appeal
or
a
defense
appeal
of
any
criminal
case
that
took
less
than
three
days
to
try,
or
a
pretrial
appeal,
it
is
automatically
expedited.
there
is
nothing
either
party
needs
to
do--
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
--no,
we
didn't.
it
was
an
automatic
rule.
we
knew
from
the
get-go
by
reading
rule
20
that
the
appeal
was
going
to
be
expedited.
both
sides
got
their
briefs
in
on
an
expedited
schedule.
the
calendaring
of
the
argument
was
done
expeditiously,
and
then
the
case
sat
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
years
thereafter.
it
is
just
the
operation
of
the
rule.
it
is
nothing
that
the
government
did.
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
justice
o'connor,
let
me
take
a
minute
and--
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
--let
me
take
a
couple
of
minutes
and
try
to
put
you
in
the
picture
where
this
case
was
in
1976,
and
you
can
see
that
the
record
is
otherwise.
what
happened
was
that
judge
boloney
ruled
on
a
suppression
motion
that
evidence
ought
to
be
suppressed.
the
government
three
weeks
thereafter,
approximately
four
weeks
before
the
trial
date,
noticed
an
appeal.
after
they
did
that,
they
came
into
the
district
court
and
the
record
of
the
transcript
of
april
19th
shows
that
they
came
into
court
and
said
we
may
want
to
ask
for
a
continuance
of
the
trial
date.
the
defense
lawyers
at
that
point
said,
judge
boloney,
we
want
a
speedy
trial.
we
are
prepared
to
go
to
trial
on
may
12th.
we
have
all
our
machinery
set
to
go.
you
have
got
to
remember
that
these
were
indigent
defendants
that
had
a
following,
that
were
helping
them
prepare
their
trial.
there
were
people
going
out
and
doing
jury
surveys.
they
had
people
donating
money
for
their
telephone
bills,
and
so
forth.
they
were
set
to
go.
the
judge
said,
i
am
prepared
to
try
this
case
on
may
12th.
then
what
did
the
government
do?
the
government
asked
for
continuances.
we
opposed
them
the
government
thereafter
asked
the
ninth
circuit
to
order
the
district
court
to
stay
the
proceedings,
and
to
say
that
this
was
necessary,
by
the
way,
for
all
consideration
of
the
suppression
motion
is
erroneous
because
two
of
the
counts
were
not
even
concerned
with
the
suppressed
evidence.
both
the
circuit
court
and
the
district
court
denied
any
stay.
we
demanded
a
speedy
trial
at
that
point.
the
only
reason
there
was
a
dismissal
order
that
needed
to
be
appealed
in
the
first
instance
is,
on
may
12th,
1976,
in
the
face
of
the
defendant's
demands,
and
in
the
face
of
the
orders
of
both
the
district
and
the
court
of
appeals
denying
stay,
the
government
said,
we
refuse
to
proceed.
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
they
wanted
to
appeal
the
suppressed
evidence
not
only
as
to
the
three
counts,
but
also
as
to
the
two
remaining
counts.
they
are
correct
in
saying
that
the
counts
were
not
severed,
but
it
was
the
government's
duty
to
come
in
and
sever,
not
ours
to
make
or
the
judge
to
make.
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
what
we
were
looking
at
was
the
circumstance
where
we
wanted
the
case
to
proceed
to
trial
or
any
part
thereof,
and
we
thought
it
was
the
government's
duty
because
it
was
their
case
and
their
motion
to
make.
in
any
event,
one
thing
that
permeates
the
government's
brief
that
really
sincerely
bothers
me
is
a
belief
that
no
defendant
ever
really
wants
a
speedy
trial,
and
that
if
he
asserts
that
right,
he
is
basically
lying.
and
what
i
am
suggesting
in
response
to
your
question,
justice
o'connor,
is,
we
were
there,
we
made
the
demand,
and
it
is
not
the
government's
position
to
either
believe
or
disbelieve
us.
that
should
not
determine
whether
we
get
our
speedy
trial
or
not.
if
we
demand
it,
and
the
government
stands
in
the
face
of
that
demand
and
says
you
are
not
going
to
get
it
in
the
face
of
court
orders,
the
order
would
be
a
sanction
of
the
barker-wingo
before
that
recalcitrance,
and
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
held
and
the
district
court
has
held.
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
no.
i
believe
he
is
misreading
a
footnote.
there
is
one
issue
that
the
district
court
decided
on.
the
district
court
found
sufficient
prejudice
in
the
record
to,
in
addition
to
dismissing
the
case
for
violation
of
speedy
trial,
also
on
the
due
process
clause
was
there
a
dismissal,
and
we
merely
put
in
a
footnote
that
if
this
case
came
back
for
trial,
we
would
also
ask
for
dismissal
under
the
due
process
clause.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
during
the
pendency
of
this
appeal,
another
witness
has
died.
so
we
have
suffered
more
prejudice,
and
if
we
were
left
with
the
due
process
clause,
we
would
ask
for
a
dismissal
under
that.
let
me
for
a
minute
address
the
government's
contention
that
somehow
we
wanted
to
delay
this
trial
by
filing
a
number
of
motions.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
waiver
of
the
demand
for
a
speedy
trial
by
filing
the
motions.
the
district
court
rejected
that.
the
circumstance
is
not
one
motion
in
this
case
delayed
the
trial
by
one
day.
the
ones
they
are
talking
about,
specifically
the
native
american
judge
motion,
for
instance,
that
was
filed
at
the
behest
of
a
defendant,
russell
regner,
argued
by
him
before
judge
boloney.
he
took
it
under
advisement
and,
of
course,
denied
it
expeditiously.
the
record
reflects
that
over
two-thirds
of
the
defense
motions
in
this
case
were
actually
granted
in
whole
or
in
part
when
they
were
ruled
upon.
the
government
can
say
that
for
less
than
a
third
of
their
motions.
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
i
think
the
difference
between
the
government's
position
and
ours
is,
the
government
is
saying,
once
you
start
the
ball
in
motion,
you
can't
complain
about
all
the
delay
that
happens
thereafter,
and
what
we
are
saying
is
that
under
barker-wingo
a
judge
should
be
able
to
realize
that
a
valid
reason
for
delay
justifies
appropriate
delay,
not
endless
delay,
appropriate
delay.
so,
if
we
file
a
motion
that
is
going
to
result
in
some
delay,
or
if
the
government
exercises
a
right
that
is
going
to
result
in
some
delay,
that
delay
should
be
reasonable
and
associated
with
the
justification
for
the
delay.
it
should
not
be
unlimited.
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
okay.
there
are
two
rounds
for
the
unreasonable
delay.
one
is
the
government's
refusal
to
proceed
to
trial,
and
that
is
weighed
heavily
against
them,
and
the
second
is
just
the
length
of
time
that
it
took
this
case
to
be
resolved
on
appeal.
it
took
six
and
a
half
years
to
decide
two
appeals.
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
no,
i
think
the
circuit
senses
of
each
have
to
be
looked
at.
i
think
that
they
have
yet
to
basically
take
the
view
of
what
is
necessary
under
the
circumstances
and
whether
the
court
has
evidenced
a
desire
to
provide
a
speedy
trial
for
a
defendant.
i
think
that
is
perhaps
one
of
the
problems
that
we
have
to
address
here,
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
evidence
absolutely
no
understanding
that
this
case
was
a
pretrial
case
that
deserved
some
expedition
beyond
the
other
cases,
and
in
doing
research,
i
found
that
the
statistical
analysis
done
by
the
u.s.
administrative
offices
does
not
even
keep
separate
statistics
for
pretrial
appeals.
it
is
just
something
that
seems
to
me
to
go
through
the
system
without
anybody
realizing
that
these
cases
desire
and
need
some
expedition,
because
there
are
some
people
waiting
for
their
trial,
and
that
the
system
is
being
hurt
by
the
delay
in
this
case.
also,
there--
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
--correct.
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
excuse
me?
they
weren't?
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
well,
not--
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
--well,
it
could
be
said,
but
i
think--
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
--but
the
point
is
that
either
side
has
a
right
to
exercise
certain
rights
in
the
proceeding,
and
that--
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
--that's
right,
and
i
think
a
reasonable
time
is
permissible.
i
think
unreasonable
time
is
not
associated
with--
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
--i
don't
think
we
could
set
a
standard.
i
think
we
have
to
allow
the
district
court
judge
to
look
at
the
circumstances
of
each
case,
and
if
i
am
correct,
your
honor,
on
one
point
they
were
not
correct
as
to
the
dismissal
on
the
first
instance.
that
was
never
overturned
on
appeal.
it
was
the
sanction
because
the
court
found
that
the
judge
did
not
properly
give
the
government
forewarning
of
a
sanction,
but
the
dismissal
itself
was
upheld,
and
the
court
of
appeals
has
always
been
exceptionally
clear
that
the
government
had
no
reason
not
to
try
this
case
on
may
12th,
1976,
when
the
defendants
were
found
to
be
ready.
additionally,
i
would
like
to
point
to
the
court
that
the
experience
of
the
amicus
in
this
case
of
a
defender
service
is
such
that
the
government's
reasons
for
wanting
such
an
exclusion
from
the
sixth
amendment
has
no
basis
in
fact
there
is
no
problem
that
needs
to
be
addressed.
the
government
engages
in
a
rather
prolific
pretrial
appeal
practice
in
the
d.c.
courts,
and
they
have
not
lost
one
case
from
unnecessary
delay
in
the
appellate
process.
and
the
amicus
experience
in
the
d.c.
courts
is
that
the
calculus
of
the
length
of
delay
in
the
barker-wingo
analysis
is
the
only
impetus
that
keeps
those
cases
moving
with
any
speed
at
all.
so,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
it
is
a
fiction
that
appellate
delay
is
so
different
from
any
other
type
of
delay
that
barker-wingo
can't
analyze
it
correctly,
and
it
is
a
fiction
to
say
that
that
delay
cannot
harm
the
fundamental
interests
protected
by
the
speedy
trial
clause.
as
to
the
second
issue
in
this
case,
the
macdonald
case,
i
think
that
there
are
a
number
of
important
distinctions,
but
the
one
i
would
like
to
focus
on
here
is
that
in
macdonald,
once
there
was
a
voluntary
dismissal,
once
the
government
formerly
dropped
charges,
there
was
no
case
pending.
there
has
always
been
a
pending
case
of
u.s.
v.
loud
hawk.
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
well,
our
definition
includes
a
time
not
only
when
we
feel
that
we
have
been
defending
our
clients
against
a
government
prosecution,
but
congress
has
determined
that.
they
can
have
jurisdiction
on
appeal
on
these
orders.
they
are
in
continuing
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court
over
the
defendants,
and
for
litigations
of
motions
which
happened
while
this
case
was
dismissed.
we
litigated
bail
motions.
we
litigated
government
motions
to
depose
their
witnesses
during
the
dismissal.
we
litigated
motions
for
a
continuation
of
government
subpoenas
during
this
dismissal
in
the
district
court.
their
presence
was
required.
defendants'
presence
was
required
during
the
remand
hearing
in
1978
from
the
ninth
circuit,
and
even
though
that
was--
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
--that
was
while
the
case
was
still
dismissed.
that
was
after
the
panel
decision,
and
while
it
was
en
banc,
while
it
was
consideration
en
banc,
and
in
fact
they
did
not
appear
because
they
had
filed
waivers,
but
they
still
had
to
appear
by
order
of
the
court
in
the
district
court.
they
also
had
appointed
for
them
lawyers.
congress
has
determined
that
these
people
that
are
the
subject
of
an
involuntary
dismissal
need
lawyers
appointed
for
them
if
they
are
indigent,
and
they
had
those
lawyers,
and
congress
in
other
statutes
also
refers
to
people
in
this
situation,
people
whose
case
has
been
dismissed
and
is
on
appeal
as
defendants
and
as
persons
charged
with
crime,
and
congress
has
also
determined
under
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedure
48(a)
that
when
the
government
formally
drops
charges
of
voluntary
dismissal,
like
in
the
macdonald
case,
the
prosecution
shall
thereupon
terminate.
under
48(b),
the
dismissal
for
unnecessary
delay,
there
is
no
such
statement,
and
i
think
as
a
practical
matter
what
happens
in
a
case
like
this
is
not
that
it
evaporates,
not
that
it
goes
away
when
the
judge
dismisses
it
in
the
district
court,
but
that
merely
a
defendant
wins
on
the
ground
of
first
persuasion
in
the
first
instance,
and
the
government
thereafter
takes
that
case,
and
the
issue
with
the
same
defendant
based
on
the
same
facts
and
the
same
indictment,
the
same
parties,
and
merely
moves
it
to
another
forum,
and
the
litigation
continues.
it
is
not
some
separate
case.
it
is
this
case,
and
it
continues.
i
think
to
focus
on
the
technical
nature
of
the
dismissal
on
this
case
rather
than
on
the
actuality
of
the
prosecution
would
create
a
grave
injustice.
as
i
mentioned
to
the
court
before,
it
was
in
1976
that
these
defendants
stood
ready
for
trial,
demanding
their
trial.
the
only
reason
they
moved
to
dismiss
is
because
the
government
violated
court
orders
to
proceed.
if
the
government
had...
let's
look
at
it
this
way.
if
we
had
desired
delay,
as
the
government
suggests,
what
greater
opportunity?
here
was
the
government
coming
into
the
district
court
saying
continue
the
trial.
we
could
have
had
delay--
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
--that
is
correct,
but
the
reason
they
refused
to
proceed
was
because
they
felt
that
the
evidence
that
was
suppressed
would
be
helpful
for
the
remaining
counts.
it
was
not
substantial
proof
of
a
fact
material
to
those
remaining
counts
as
3173
requires
for
an
appeal,
and
that
was
the
basis
of
the
dismissal.
judge
boloney
said
on
that
date
that
he
couldn't
understand
why
the
government
wouldn't
proceed
because
the
evidence
was
not
material
to
the
two
remaining
counts.
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
the
determination
because
the
judge
gave
no
forewarning.
it
upheld
the
dismissal
because
they
didn't
proceed
to
trial
on
that
date
on
those
two
counts.
that
is
why
they
severed
the...
that
is
where
the
two
counts
are
different,
because
the
firearms
and
the
dynamite
counts
were
viewed
separately,
and
there
was
never
held
to
be
any
excuse
why
the
government
didn't
proceed
on
that
basis.
so,
if
we
had
desiring
to--
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
--as
to
the
other
counts,
that
is
correct.
so
if
we
had
desired
at
that
time
to
have
unlimited
delay,
what
would
we
have
done?
we
would
have
sat
there
and
said,
fine,
take
your
continuance.
there
is
no
question
under
this
court's
case
law,
and
as
the
government
concedes,
we
would
have
had
the
right
to
a
speedy
trial
applied
to
us
under
macdonald
and
under
that
circumstance,
because
there
would
have
been
a
"live
indictment".
so,
to
focus
on
the
technicality
of
the
dismissal
really
punishes
these
defendants
for
wanting
a
speedy
trial
was
that
desire
for
a
speedy
trial
required
the
government
to
proceed
and
give
them
that
speedy
trial,
and
when
they
refused,
the
case
was
dismissed.
in
addition...
well,
basically,
i
would
like
to
say
at
this
point
that
i
think
that
what
we
have
here
is
a
situation
where
their
needs
and
message
come
from
this
court
to
both
the
government
and
to
the
appellate
courts
to
decide
more
expeditiously
through
the
appellate
courts,
and
if
there
is
not
sufficient
machinery,
which
i
don't
know
that
to
be
the
case,
but
if
there
is
not
sufficient
machinery
for
them
to
make
those
expeditious
rulings,
and
parenthetically
it
may
be,
because
in
1976
and
'77
and
'78
the
ninth
circuit
was
understaffed
by
13
judges,
the
congress
should
give
them
that
machinery
so
they
can
act
expeditiously,
but
in
any
event,
that
they
should
go
and
recognize
that
the
cases
are
pretrial,
that
people
and
the
system
suffers
when
there
is
no
speedy
trial
given
in
that
circumstance.
and
secondly,
i
think
there
needs
to
be
a
clear
message
to
government
that
it
need
not
believe
a
defendant
when
he
says
that
he
wants
a
speedy
trial,
but
when
he
says
it
and
they
have
an
opportunity
to
give
it,
and
they
are
ordered
to
provide
it,
they
had
better
provide
it.
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
sure.
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
they
requested...
the
circumstances--
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
--the
government
came
in
in
mid-april
and
said--
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
--of
1976.
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
and
they
said...
what
happened
is,
it
was
a
switch
of
prosecutors,
because
they
thought
that
they
might
have
the
case
on
appeal,
and
it
might
not
go,
and
they
might
ask
for
a
continuance,
so
they
shifted
prosecutors,
and
this
was
on
april
13th,
actually.
they
came
in
and
said,
here
are
the
new
prosecutors
in
this
case.
we
may
not
want
to
be
able
to
proceed
on
may
12th.
the
first
word
out
of
dennis
roberts,
who
was
the
lawyer
for
dennis
banks
at
the
time,
said,
before
we
go
on
to
the
other
business
we
are
scheduled
to
do
here
today,
i
want
the
record
to
reflect
my
absolute
opposition
to
any
continuance
in
this
case
on
behalf
of
myself,
my
cocounsel,
my
defendant
and
codefendants.
we
hereby
demand
a
trial
on
may
12th,
1976.
judge
boloney
said
there
has
been
no
motion
for
a
continuance
filed.
i,
too,
want
to
try
this
case
on
may
12th.
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
what
happened
then
is
that
the
next
hearing...
well,
they
filed
a
motion
for
a
continuance.
that
was
denied.
then
they
filed
a
motion
for
a
stay
in
the
ninth
circuit,
and
that
was
pending
on
april
26th,
when
the
next
hearing
was
held
in
the
district
court.
that
was
the
first
time
the
government
came
in
and
said,
your
honor,
probably
what
will
happen
in
this
case
is,
we
are
not
going
to
proceed,
because
we
think
the
evidence
will
be
helpful
to
the
two
other
counts.
and
judge
boloney
said,
no,
i
want
to
have
this
case
tried
on
may
12th,
1976,
and
they
said,
well,
we
are
probably
not
going
to
go
and
proceed
at
that
time.
we
made
our
opposition
exceptionally
clear,
and
we
filed
in
fact,
and
it
is
in
the
appendix,
a
very
strong
opposition
from
the
ninth
circuit
on
that
same
date
while
they
were
considering
that.
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
the
motions
for
speedy
trial
or
the
requests
for
speedy
trial
when
the
government
was
requesting
continuances
were
all
on
the
record,
open
court,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
including
up
to
the
day
of
trial,
when
we
stood
demanding
our
trial,
and
the
government
said
we
refuse
to
proceed,
and
thereafter,
too,
i
might
point
out
that
at
the
future
time,
too,
in
1983,
on
the
march
9th,
1983,
transcript,
on
pages
2
through
18,
it
reflects
again
this
case
came--
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
--we
have
always
wanted
a
speedy
trial,
yes.
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
when
the
case
was
pending
in
front
of
the
ninth
circuit,
we
still
obviously
wanted
a
speedy
trial.
there
is
not
much
neither
the
government
nor
we
can
do
to
expedite
the
procedures,
but
i
might
even
suggest
that
when
this
case
came
down
after
the
cert
petition
was
denied
on
the
second
appeal,
the
government
would
suggest
that
we
filed
that
just
for
delay,
but
the
record
reflects
just
the
opposite.
we
came
back
down
march
9th,
1983.
we
demanded
a
speedy
trial.
the
government
came
in
saying
we
don't
know
where
our
witnesses
are.
we
haven't
been
on
top
of
them
for
years.
we
have
to
go
and
find
them.
it
is
going
to
take
us
a
couple
of
months
to
get
ready
for
trial,
and
we
said
basically
that
is
nonsense.
we
have
had
the
responsibility
of
keeping
this
case
prepared
for
many
years.
we
know
where
our
witnesses
are.
we
want
our
speedy
trial.
so
it
has
been
throughout
the
litigation
that
there
has
been
a
demand.
the
major
crunch
time
happened
in
1976
in
terms
of
the
government's
irresponsible
refusal
to
proceed,
but
there
has
always
been
a
demand
for
a
speedy
trial
on
the
record,
as
the
district
court
so
found.
unless
there
are
any
further
questions,
i
think
i
am
finished.
thank
you.
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
there
is
a
speedy
trial
act,
but
it
does
not
address
the
delay
in
the
appellate
system.
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
it
excludes
the
time--
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
--i
suspect
that
act
was
promulgated
to
speed
up
the
proceedings
in
the
district
court.
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
i
don't
know
if
that
is
true,
but
if
it
is--
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
--it
doesn't
apply,
but--
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
--it
is
expressly
excluded.
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
i
suspect
because
they
were
addressing
themselves
to
the
district
court
rather
than
to
the
appellate
system,
and
i
think
that
the
congress
certainly
could.
it
would
have
the
power
if
it
so
decided
tomorrow--
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
--i
think
it
is
up
to
this
court
to
rule
whether
appellate
delay
can
violate
its
right
to
a
speedy
trial,
yes.
i
don't
think
that
this
court--
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
--i
don't
think
that
that
is
relevant
one
way
or
another.
i
think
that
it
is
clear
even
in
the
circumstances
where
the
speedy
trial
act
is
applied
clearly
to
things
that
happened
in
the
district
court.
the
fact
that
congress
seems
to
apply
in
a
certain
circumstance
and
not--
mr.
kenneth
saul
stern
--oh,
i
know.
i
know.
congress
felt
that...
in
fact,
in
macdonald,
in
the
footnote,
this
court
held
that
the
act
was
made
to
promulgate
the
concerns
of
the
sixth
amendment,
but
the
point
is
that
congress
by
not
acting
cannot
decide
for
this
court
whether
appellate
delay
hinges
upon
the
defendant's
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
thank
you.
