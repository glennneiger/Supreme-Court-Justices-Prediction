justice
john
paul
stevens
how
much
time
did
it
take
the
judge
to
dispose
of
those
three
motions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
suggesting
they
were
obviously
frivolous,
i
take
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then,
if
they
were,
it
wouldn't
really
take
much
time
to
decide
them,
would
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
compare
that
with
the
time
the
case
was
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals.
which
was
greater?
wasn't
that
several
years
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
get
one
thing
clear
in
my
own
mind?
during
the
period
the
appeal
was
pending,
would
the
district
judge
have
had
the
statutory
authority
to
impose
some
kind
of
restraints?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
he
would
not
have
had
in
mcdonald?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
your
argument
is
that
unless
he
actually
imposes
the
restraint,
you
should
not
count
the
time
at
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kuhlik,
can
i
just
interrupt
for
one
factual
question?
you
say
the
dynamite
had
been
suppressed.
hadn't
the
dynamite
been
destroyed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
exactly
was
suppressed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kuhlik,
can
i
ask
you
to
address
just
one
more
point?
your
opponent
argues
that
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
has
a
rule
that
counts
appellate
time
and
that
has
not
resulted
in
any
losses
of
prosecution,
and
he
also
mentions
the
fact
in
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
late
seventies
there
was
a
shortage
of
judges,
and
they
were
way,
way
behind
in
their
work.
to
what
extent
do
we
have
a
problem
of
general
significance,
or
is
it
just
one
case
that
is
at
stake?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
goes
to
the
question
of
whether
they
properly
counted
the
time,
but
you
are...
you
are
sticking
with
your
argument,
though,
that
even
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
rule
was
quit
wrong?
