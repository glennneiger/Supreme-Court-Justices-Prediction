justice
byron
r.
white
when
an
indictment
is
dismissed,
as
it
was
in
this
case,
is
the
defendant
then
completely
free
or
isn't
he
still
being
held
to
answer
a
criminal
charge?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
have
rearrested
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
that...
a
little
while
ago
you
said
that
he
could
have
been
put
on
bail.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
can
you
put
him
on
bail
if
he
isn't...
unless
he
is
being
held
to
answer
for
a
criminal
charge?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
do
you
put
him
on
bail?
arrest
him
again?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i--
--you
think
he
is
absolutely
free
in
this
case.
he
wasn't
under
arrest--
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
you
filed
the
motions,
and
they
were
ruled
on
by
the
district
court,
and
the
government
thought
they
were
erroneously
ruled--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
they
were.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
were.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
were,
so
at
least
it
could
be
said
that
you
talked
the
district
court
into
error.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
proved
out
that
the
court
was
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly,
and
the
government
has
a
right
to
appeal
a
ruling
that
it
thinks
erroneous.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
long?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
a
federal
speedy
trial
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
do
you
suppose
it
excludes
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
congress
didn't
think
that
they
ought
to
subject
the
appellate
time
to
the
speedy
trial
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
doesn't
apply,
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
is
expressly
excluded,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
you
suppose
that
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
think
that
we
ought
to
on
a
constitutional
basis
do
what
congress
has
expressly
not
done.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
we
ought
to
take
into
consideration
the
fact
that
congress
has
not
seen
fit
to
impose
the
speedy
trial
act
on
appellate
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
have
you
looked
at
the
legislative
history?
