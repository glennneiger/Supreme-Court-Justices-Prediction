justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
the
delay,
that
long
delay
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
the...
when
they
were
proceeding
en
banc
in
the
first
appeal?
can
delay
in
a
court
ever
be
charged
to
the
government?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
nonlawyers
would
think
that
three
years
was
an
awfully
long
time.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
stern,
either
you
are
putting
district
judge...
judge
burns
or
whoever
it
was
in
a
very
awkward
position
to
have
them
say
in
adjudicating
a
speedy
trial
motion
that
the
court
of
appeals
which
regularly
reviews
their
decision
took
too
long
to
decide
this
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
the
government's
reason,
that
they
wanted
to
appeal
the
suppression?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
maybe
if
you
are
demanding
a
speedy
trial
on
counts
that
aren't
affected
by
the
suppression
order,
maybe
you
have
a
duty
to
move
to
set.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
the
government's
position
that
if
you
file
a
number
of
pretrial
motions,
you
are
in
effect
opening
the
way
for
very
likely
appeals
pretrial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
where
is
the
unreasonable
delay
here,
in
your
view,
in
the
appellate
process?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
just
want
them
together
kind
of
en
bloc
that
way
and
say
that
two
appeals
divided
into
six
and
a
half
years
means
three
and
a
quarter
years
per
appeal,
and
that
is
too
much?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
do
you
define
a
pending
case?
obviously,
your
definition
doesn't
include
an
outstanding
indictment.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
that
after
the
reversal
of
the
dismissal?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
the
reason
they
wanted
to
continue
was,
they
felt
that
the
suppression
order
was
damaging
to
their
case,
and
that
they
have
a
right
to
appeal
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
that
determination.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
as
to
the
other
counts--
