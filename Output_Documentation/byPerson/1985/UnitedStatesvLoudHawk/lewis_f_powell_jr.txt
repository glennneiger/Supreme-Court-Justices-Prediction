justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
stern,
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
let's
assume
that
for
this
case
in
the
long
process
you
are
discussing
had
been
appealed
to
this
court
and
argued
in
october,
and
we
finally
brought
a
decision
down
on
the
30th
of
june.
how
much
of
that
time
would
you
charge
to
the
government?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
a
district
court
judge
would
decide
what
part
of
that
time
we
were
delaying
and
should
have
brought
the
case
down--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--would
the
district
court
have
to
make
that
inquiry
if
we
delayed
it
for
two
months?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
or
six?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
are
asking
us
to
lay
down
a
general
standard.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
every
defendant
would
ask
that
that
be
done.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--mr.
stern,
will
you
refresh
my
recollection
please--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--as
to
when
the
defendants
requested
on
the
record
that
the
trial
be
proceeded
with?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
when
did
they
first
make
a
request
for
a
speedy
trial?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
of
what
year?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
what
happened
then?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
were
there
further
motions
on
the
record
for
a
speedy
trial?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
they
always
want
a
speedy
trial
when
they
have
had
a
case
pending
on
appeal?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
when
they...
primarily
because
they
had
a
case
pending
on
appeal
in
the
ninth
circuit?
