justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
saltzburg,
before
you
go
on,
when
you
talk
about
a
meaningful
remedy,
are
you
talking
about
the
right
to
recover
or
the
right
to
have
access
to
the
state
court
to
present
your
case
and
take
what
defenses
may
be
advanced
as
they
come
along?
i
think
you
are
satisfied
that
sovereign
immunity
will
be
played
in
this
case,
but
i
would
suppose
in
many
cases
the
state
would
elect
not
to
do
it.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
such
as
contributory
negligence.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
just
ask
this
question,
mr.
saltzburg?
someone
mentioned
what
would
be
the
situation
if
a
prisoner
were
being
transported
and
had
an
automobile
accident
as
a
result
of
his
negligence.
assume,
for
example,
that
this
deputy
sheriff
was
transporting
your
client
in
this
case
down
to
federal
court
to
testify
in
a
case
and
did
have
an
automobile
accident
and
was
charged
with
negligence.
i
suppose
your
position
would
be
the
same,
would
it?
would
you
view
that
as
identical
to
being
in
jail?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
the
prisoner
were
being
taken
to
his
doctor's
office.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
might
make
a
difference.
