we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
daniels
against
williams.
mr.
saltzburg,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
it
is
a
negligence
case,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
your
client
had
been
in
a
federal
prison
what
would
be
the
situation
with
exactly
the
same
facts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
didn't
get
what
you
said.
you
could
sue,
of
course.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
the
governmental
function
and
discretionary--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--the
function
of
a
prison
is
a
discretionary
function,
isn't
it,
a
governmental
function?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
short,
would
you
or
would
you
not
have
a
remedy
if
you
were
in
federal
prison?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
would
be
contrary
to
quite
a
few
holdings
of
this
court,
wouldn't
it,
on
discretionary
function?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
hopper?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
aren't
intentional
torts
distinguished
from
negligence
for
a
great
many
reasons?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
could
be
an
assault
and
battery,
pushing
someone
down
the
stairs.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
quite
different
from
ordinary
negligence,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
raise
your
voice
a
little
bit,
mr.
hopper?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
not
sure
our
microphones
are
working
well.
how
about
gross
negligence
or
reckless
conduct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let's
pursue
that
business
of
intention
a
bit.
an
act
of
negligence
occurs
in
not
keeping
the
floors
safe
or
the
stairways
safe
as
compared
with
the
situation
of
a
guard
assaulting
the
person.
one
is
within
the
scope
of
employment
and
hitting
somebody
over
the
head
with
a
bat
or
club
is
not
within
the
scope
of
employment.
doesn't
that
afford
a
basis
for
a
difference
in
the
two?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
saltzburg?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
