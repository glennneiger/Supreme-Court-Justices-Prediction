mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
must
begin
by
confessing
that
the
facts
of
this
case
are
much
less
exciting
than
the
two
cases
previously
heard
by
the
court.
indeed,
the
facts
are
quite
simple.
a
state
prisoner
in
virginia,
a
prisoner
in
the
richmond
city
jail
to
be
exact,
filed
a
suit
in
federal
district
court
alleging
that
he
was
injured
while
he
was
incarcerated
in
the
richmond
city
jail.
and,
he
alleged
specifically
that
he
slipped
on
a
pillow
which
was
on
some
newspapers
on
the
stairs
in
the
jail.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
mr.
chief
justice,
it
sounds
like
a
negligence
case
and
both
parties
have
treated
it
as
such.
the
facts
hardly
look
like
facts
that
would
support
a
federal
action
or
a
case
that
this
court
should
spend
its
time
on,
but,
in
fact,
this
case
and
these
facts
really
are
a
messenger
of
major
issue
and
how
the
court
decides
that
issue
will
be
of
great
importance
to
everyone
incarcerated
in
any
jail
or
prison
in
any
state
in
this
country.
and,
that
issue,
simply
put,
is
whether
or
not
persons
who
are
incarcerated
have
a
right
to
be
cared
for,
have
their
persons
protected
by
those
who
have
been
entrusted
with
their
safety.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
justice
white,
yes.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
not
only
yes,
but
a
very
important
part
of
our
argument
will
be
that
the
reason
why
we
urge
that
there
was
a
duty
upon
the
state
to
provide
some
kind
of
compensation
for
a
prisoner
who
can
prove
that
he
was,
in
fact,
injured
while
in
custody
is
that
is
part
of
the
due
process
of
law
the
person
is
entitled
to
when
he
is
incarcerated
as
a
person
may
be
under
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
the
court
of
appeals
sitting
en
banc
decided
three
questions,
all
adverse
to
the
petitioner.
it
decided
by
a
five
to
four
vote
that
this
court's
decision
in
parratt
v.
taylor
which
had
held
that
a
prisoner
could
bring
a
suit
seeking
compensation
for
a
negligent
deprivation
of
property,
as
long
as
there
was
no
meaningful
state
remedy,
that
parratt
did
not
apply
to
liberty
interest,
did
not
apply
to
injuries
to
the
person,
and
that
a
prisoner
had
no
right
to
sue
in
federal
court
for
injuries
to
his
person
even
if
no
state
remedy
were
available.
an
unanimous
court
of
appeals,
nine-zero,
held
that
parratt...
another
holding,
that
the
parratt
case
ought
to
apply
to
liberty
and
property
interests,
meaning
that
even
if
it
were
wrong
concerning
protection
of
the
person,
that
if
a
meaningful
remedy
were
available
in
state
court
that
for
this
kind
of
injury
a
prisoner
could
not
sue
in
federal
court
under
1983.
finally,
a
six
to
three
split
on
the
court
held
that
there
was
a
meaningful
remedy
in
state
court.
this
afternoon
i
would
like
to
concede
at
the
outset
one
of
the
major
points
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals.
we
do
not
quarrel
with
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals,
the
nine
to
nothing
holding,
which
is
parratt
applies
in
cases
in
which
a
prisoner
is
claiming
that
he
was
injured
as
a
result
of
the
tortious
conduct
of
a
safety
officer
while
in
custody
and
whether
that
tort
is
negligence
or
an
intentional
tort,
not
an
independent
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
but,
we
concede
that
the
parratt
reasoning
ought
to
apply,
if,
indeed,
a
meaningful
remedy
were
available
in
state
court
for
this
petitioner,
this
petitioner
ought
not
to
be
able
to
proceed
with
the
section
1983
action.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
yes,
justice
o'connor.
perhaps
i
can
explain
or
answer
that
best
this
way.
the
drafters
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
of
the
1866
and
1871
civil
rights
statutes
which
enforced
the
fourteenth
amendment
plainly
had
in
mind,
as
this
court
has
noted
several
times
in
the
legislative
history
cited
in
monroe
v.
pape
and
mitchum
versus
foster,
that
one
of
the
evils
that
gave
rise
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
civil
rights
statutes
was
the
problem
of
law
enforcement
officers,
sheriffs
as
well
as
courts,
failing
to
do
what
was
necessary
to
protect
people
in
their--
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
--justice
o'connor,
there
are
two
answers
that
i
would
like
to
give
you
to
that.
one
is
the
court
has
looked
at
the
meaning
of
the
word
v.
taylor
and
the
majority
of
the
court,
in
justice
rehnquist's
opinion,
said
that
in
the
context
of
a
$23.50
hobby
kit
which
had
been
lost
that
the
prisoner
was
deprived
of
liberty
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
by
a
negligent
act.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
yes,
justice
blackmun,
that
was
a
property
case.
ours
is
a
liberty
case.
in
a
moment
i
will
argue
liberty
deserves
as
much
protection
as
property.
but,
justice
o'connor,
there
is
also
a
second
answer
and
i
think
that
before
the
court
is
an
argument
implicit,
i
suppose,
in
this
case,
but
almost
explicit,
that
maybe
parratt
ought
to
be
reconsidered.
maybe
the
court
should
take
another
look.
and,
we
had
anticipated
that
and
briefed
it
and
i
intend
to
argue
that
too,
that
even
if
the
court
looks
again,
that
parratt
was
indeed
correct.
the
first
point
that
i
would...
there
are
three
major
points
i
would
like
to
argue
and
that
is,
justice
blackmun,
as
you
said,
the
first
point
is
that
liberty
interests
deserve
as
much
protection
at
least
as
property
interests.
the
second
point
is
that
negligent
deprivations
should
be
deemed
to
be
within
section
1983
when
prisoners
are
in
custody
and
in
control
of
state
officers.
and,
the
third
point
is
that
there
was
no
meaningful
remedy
within
the
meaning
of
parratt
and
the
chief
justice's
opinion
for
the
court
in
hudson
v.
palmer
in
virginia
state
courts
at
the
time
this
suit
was
filed.
on
the
first
point,
whether
liberty
interests
should
be
given
as
much
protection
as
property
interests,
this
argument...
the
argument
i
make
is
the
one
that
i
believe
finds
strong
support
in
virtually
everything
this
court
usually
looks
at
in
rendering
decisions
on
the
law,
on
constitutional
law
and
the
meaning
of
statutes.
the
history
of
the
civil
rights
statute
is
a
history
set
forth
at
some
length
in
monroe
versus
pape
and
mitchum
v.
foster
and
it
is
a
history
of
a
congress
concerned
with
the
abuse
of
people.
it
is
true
that
property
sometimes
was
damaged
when
people
were
deprived
of
their
rights,
but
it
is
a
history
that
speaks
eloquently
about
people.
the
language
of
the
civil
rights
act
does
not
mention
the
word
"property".
it
speaks
about
interest
protected,
the
rights
protected
by
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states.
even
if
the
court
somehow
were
to
want
to
draw
a
line
between
liberty
and
property,
as
the
four
dissenting
judges
said
in
the
court
below,
surely
the
person
would
come
out
on
top
in
any
rational
system.
and,
indeed,
drawing
the
line
between
liberty
and
property
is
not
only
difficult,
but
it
may
be
unnecessary
in
most
cases.
it
is
the
deprivation
of
good
time
wrongfully,
a
deprivation
of
property
or
liberty.
it
is
the
failure
to
process
properly
a
claim
of
employment
discrimination
which
this
court
has
confronted.
is
that
a
liberty
claim
or
a
property
claim?
our
point
is
it
should
not
matter.
indeed,
there
is
a
tragic
irony
in
the
argument
that
was
made
by
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals,
an
argument
that
is
repeated
by
the
respondent
in
this
case.
prior
to
the
civil
war
and
prior
to
the
fourteenth
amendment,
this
court
was
called
upon
to
decide
whether
certain
people
and
classes
of
people
were
people
or
property
and
the
court
said
property.
a
war
was
fought,
an
amendment
was
adopted,
and
statutes
were
enacted
to
correct
that
decision.
and,
now,
the
court
of
appeals
has
held
that
certain
people
don't
even
qualify
even
as
property.
they
don't
get
as
much
protection.
in
our
view,
that
decision
flies
in
the
face
of
the
language
of
the
statute.
it
ignores
the
decisions
of
this
court
which
has
emphasized
the
history
of
that
statute.
it
flies
in
the
face
of
logic
and
it
is
wrong
as
a
matter
of
law.
that
is
the
easiest
point
in
our
view
that
we
have
to
make
this
afternoon.
the
second
point
is
the
more
difficult
one.
it
is
made
more
difficult
by
the
fact
that
in
the
case
that
follows
this,
the
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states
will
argue
to
the
court
that
it
should
not
only
reconsider
parratt,
but
it
should
reject
the
holding
of
parratt
v.
taylor.
thus,
justice
o'connor,
i
would
like
to
reach
the
question
you
asked
which
is
was
the
court
correct
when
a
majority
of
the
justices
in
the
parratt
case
said
that,
indeed,
a
negligent
deprivation
could
be
a
deprivation
of
property
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and,
therefore,
within
the
reach
of
section
1983.
it
is
not
our
contention
that
every
state
tort
gives
rise
to
a
civil
rights
action
under
section
1983.
were
we
to
have
to
argue
that,
we
could
not
win.
indeed,
the
end
of
the
parratt
opinion
contains
a
reference
to
an
automobile
accident
involving
a
state
officer
and
the
same
majority
that
had
decided
parratt
suggested
that
surely
that
alone
could
not
warrant
a
suit
under
1983.
the
solicitor
general
would
be
right
if,
in
fact,
we
were
asking
this
court
to
say
every
time
there
was
an
injury
at
the
hands
of
a
state
officer
that
there
had
to
be
a
remedy,
a
damage
remedy.
you
would
have
to
overrule
every
notion
of
sovereign
immunity
that
has
been
in
effect
both
before
and
after
the
civil
rights
law.
we
ask
this
and
only
this,
that
this
court
recognize
what
it
said
in
1856
in
south
versus
maryland;
that
there
has
been
a
common-law
duty
on
the
part
of
officers
into
whose
custody
prisoners
have
been
placed
to
protect.
the
officers
have
been
held
responsible
in
damages.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
no,
justice
rehnquist,
you
are
correct.
it
was
in
the
days...
in
a
careful
look
at
the
opinion,
one
has
difficulty
knowing
whether
the
supreme
court
was
deciding
as
a
matter
of
state
law
or
federal
common
law.
in
dictum
also,
whether
or
not
it
is
a
statement
about
the
liability
of
a
sheriff
was
state
or
federal
law.
and,
it
is
a
pre-fourteenth
amendment
position.
our
position
is,
however,
that
the
congress
that
was
responsible
for
putting
forth
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
civil
rights
law,
that
that
congress
understood
that
for
centuries
sheriffs
and
law
enforcement
officers
were
responsible
for
persons
placed
in
their
custody.
a
decision
had
to
be
made--
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
--our
position
would
be
that
the
guest
would
not.
and,
indeed,
that
may
seem
to
be
an
unjust
result.
our
position
though
is
there
is
a
difference
between
the
guest
and
the
prisoner
in
terms
of
freedom
to
make
a
choice,
to
enter
or
not
enter.
and,
the
prisoner
has
no
such
choice.
and,
justice
stevens,
the
argument
we
make
is
premised
on
one
inescapable
fact
which
is
after
the
civil
war
the
reconstruction
congress
had
some
choices
it
had
to
make.
it
had
to
make
a
decision
on
how
much
authority
to
leave
with
state
courts,
how
much
authority
to
vest
in
federal
courts,
what
kinds
of
protections
to
give
people.
now,
it
is
possible--
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
--no,
justice
rehnquist,
i
am
not.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
due
process
clause
plus
the
civil
rights
statutes
which
were
enacted.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
yes.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
yes.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
well,
without
those
statutes
and
without
a
decision
like
bivens
versus
united
states,
it
wouldn't
have
been
clear
that
a
person
could
have
sued
in
federal
court
even
if
his
rights
had
been
violated.
what
we
ask
the
court
to
look
at
is
the
entire
body
of
legislation
enacted
following
the
civil
war.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
we
don't
quarrel
with
that,
justice
rehnquist.
we
agree
with
that.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
it
does
tie
in,
i
hope,
with
the
citation
of
south
versus
maryland,
which
this
court
said
as
a
matter
of...
may
have
been
federal
common
law.
the
assumption
being
that,
in
fact,
sheriffs
and
jailers
were
responsible
and
suable
for
damages
when
they
failed
to
protect
persons
in
their
custody.
we
ask
this
court
to
reason
from
that.
and,
when
congress
used
similar
language
to
that
which
was
found
in
the
fifth
amendment
and
it
used
the
board
language,
no
state
shall
deprive
a
person
of
liberty,
property,
or
life,
that
the
congress
would
not
have
intended
to
allow
the
states
to
escape
the
responsibility
that
they
previously
had
in
the
state
officers.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
yes,
in
the
same
situation--
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
--no.
but,
i
think
it
is
undeniably
our
contention
that
some
remedy
is
required
for
prisoners
placed
in
federal
custody
and
there
is
a
failure
to
exercise
due
care
to
protect
them.
i
would
just
note
if
i
might
in
answering
that
question
that
it
is
not
at
all
clear
that
anything
in
the
federal
tort
claims
act
now
would
stand
in
the
way
of
any
remedy.
the
kinds
of
acts
we
are
talking
about,
as
we
understand
it,
are
remedial
under
the
federal
torts
claims
act
and
the
arguments
made
which
i
really
can't
address
in
this
case,
but
will
be
addressed
in
the
next
case
concerning
the
implications
for
the
federal
system,
i
think,
are
probably
exaggerated
in
the
brief
filed
by
the
solicitor
general.
but,
it
is
our
argument
that
a
failure
to
protect
those
people
who
are
incarcerated
in
the
only
lawful
form
of
involuntary
servitude
and
incarceration
permitted
by
the
thirteenth
amendment,
that
part
and
parcel
of
the
due
process
that
they
are
entitled
to
is
the
protection
of
their
safety.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
justice
stevens,
it
is
probably
the
case
that
the
prisoner
was
protected
in
the
early
1800's
under
virginia
law
and
no
one
else
was.
there
is
a
case
cited
by
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals,
an
1820's
case,
suggesting
that
the
sheriff
would
be
liable
in
a
suit
by
the
prisoner.
the
current
state
of
virginia
law
is
probably
that
no
one
could
recover
in
state
court
against
the
sheriff
or
the
person
who
committed
the
tort.
and,
our
argument
is
that
part
and
parcel
of
due
process
when
someone
is
incarcerated
is
that
they
be
protected
and
they
are
entitled
to
a
remedy.
on
the
point
of
a
remedy,
i
would
like
to
be
clear
about
this,
we
believe
the
remedy
ought
to
be
a
state
remedy.
we
do
not
argue
to
this
court...
and
we
use
the
word
"court"
that
there
must
be
meaningful
remedy
in
a
state
court.
we
use
court
in
the
broadest
sense
of
the
term.
the
court
could
be
an
administrative
tribunal,
it
could
be
a
workman's
compensation
court.
the
question
we
believe
that
parratt
properly
phrased
was
whether
there
is
a
meaningful
remedy
that
protects
the
prisoner's
safety
in
the
hands
of
state
officials.
and,
the
argument
we
make
concerning
the
duty
of
the
state,
we
believe,
is
supported
by
the
language
in
the
screws
case
which
was
a
criminal
case
which
did
impose
an
intent
requirement
and
was
properly
distinguished,
we
believe,
in
parratt.
we
would
also
cite--
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
--justice
powell,
our
position
is
as
follows:
that
if...
the
state
may
have
many
defenses
which
do
not...
are
not
inconsistent
with
the
notion
of
a
meaningful
remedy.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
which
we
concede,
contributory
negligence
being
one,
the
statute
of
limitations
being
another.
if
the
prisoner
is
somehow
at
fault,
fails
to
comply
with
the
ordinary
rules
of
procedure,
we
do
not
say
that
the
state
should
not
be
able
to
close
its
doors
whatever
the
tribunal.
when
it
comes
to
sovereign
immunity,
our
claim
is
merely
this:
if
the
state
says
you
can
sue
but
you
cannot
recover
against
anyone,
that
is
not
a
meaningful
remedy.
there
is
a
problem
in
this
case
and
it
is
a
problem
i
must
own
up
to
and
that
is
the
prisoner
in
this
case
did
not
file
originally
a
state
court
action.
he
filed
his
suit
in
federal
court
and
his
explanation
was
he
feared
the
sovereign
immunity
defense.
even
in
federal
court
the
sovereign
immunity
defense
was
raised.
the
court
of
appeals
explicitly
asked
both
the
petitioner
and
respondent,
petitioner
would
you
go
to
state
court
if
that
defense
were
waived?
the
answer
was
yes.
they
asked
respondent,
would
you
waive
the
defense?
respondent's
position
was
we
believe...
even
though
we
claim
this
defense,
we
believe
this
defense
is
made
in
good
faith
and
can
win
in
state
court,
there
is
still
a
meaningful
remedy.
we
didn't
file
the
state
court
action
only
to
have
them
plead
again
to
show
that
it
would
be
pleaded.
it
was
already
before
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
justice
o'connor,
you
put
it
slightly
more
strongly
than
i
would.
if
i
can
soften
it
to
be
as
exact
as
i
can,
i
am
satisfied
that
current
state
of
law
in
virginia
set
forth
in
our
brief,
most
particularly
the
messina
case,
is
that
the
virginia
supreme
court
has
justified
sovereign
immunity
on
two
grounds,
one
more
recently
than
the
other,
both
on
protecting
the
public
fisc,
but
more
recently
on
the
grounds
that
it
is
important
to
encourage
people
to
be
public
officers
and
that,
in
fact,
sheriffs
repeatedly
assert
sovereign
immunity
defense
and
that
there
are
not
many
reported
decisions
because
the
circuit
courts
in
virginia--
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
--yes.
and,
that
in
this
case
i
believe
the
record
fairly
shows,
although
there
is
no
transcript
available
for
oral
argument,
that
in
fact
the
respondent
wanted
to
adhere
to
that
in
any
state
court
proceeding.
we
believe
this
case
ought
to
be
disposed
of
by
the
state.
the
most
important
thing
i
have
to
say
this
afternoon
is
that
i
do
not
represent
a
petitioner
who
is
asking
the
federal
courts
to
throw
open
the
doors
to
a
host
of
suits.
the
argument
that
i
make
on
behalf
of
this
petitioner
is
that
there
is
protection
of
the
person
required
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
is
enforceable
by
federal
civil
rights
law
and
if,
and
only
if
the
state
fails
to
provide
protection.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
justice
o'connor,
the
only
answer
i
can
make
to
that
is
if
you
accept,
and
you
may
not,
but
if
you...
if
i
can
persuade
you
to
accept
the
argument
that
part
of
due
process
when
someone
is
incarcerated...
here
is
where
the
state
does
act
intentionally,
when
it
willfully,
intentionally,
and
knowingly
says
we
are
going
to
take
away
your
freedom
and
your
ability
to
protect
yourself.
part
of
the
requirement
of
due
process
is
that
they
supply
the
protection
and
in
this
context
when
they
fail
to
do
that
for
whatever
reason
believe
that
they,
in
fact,
deprive
a
person
of
a
right.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
justice
rehnquist,
i
argue
especially
in
our
reply
brief...
i
believe
that
the
line
between
negligence
and
intention
is
far
more
looser
than
respondent
in
this
case
and
in
the
case
to
follow
would
have
the
court
believe.
if
i
might
explain,
plainly
the
state
intends
to
incarcerate,
plainly
the
state
intends
to
have
a
prisoner
do
or
not
do
certain
things.
i
do
not
believe
in
this
case
there
is
an
allegation
that
the
defendant...
respondent
intended
to
harm
the
petitioner.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
it
is
my
understanding,
mr.
chief
justice,
he
would
sue
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
where
he
would
have
a
claim.
if
he
did
not
have
one
there--
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
--under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
it
is
inconceivable
that
anyone
would
argue,
i
think,
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
that
the
person
who
leaves
a
pillow
on
the
stairs
is
exercising
a
discretionary,
a
judgmental
function.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
certain
aspects
surely
are.
and,
if
part
of
the
question
is
could
the
warden
be
sued
or
could
the
director
or
superintendent
of
the
prison
be
sued,
our
answer
is
no.
we
do
not
ask
to
have
that
part
of
sovereign
immunity
declared
to
be
invalid.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
i
believe
that
we
would
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
if
we
did
not--
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
--i
hope
not.
but,
if
we
didn't,
if
we
didn't,
and,
if,
in
fact,
the
simple
negligence
of
a
federal
prison
guard
caused
injury,
perhaps
death,
to
a
federal
prisoner
and
if
it
were
held
that
the
federal
tort
claims
act
didn't
allow
suit,
we
would
then
say
that,
in
fact,
under
bivens
that
person
could
come
in
and
ask
the
court
to
protect
his
due
process
rights
under
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
that
is
exactly
right,
justice
rehnquist.
and,
it
is
not
a
happy
result
for
us.
we
believe
these
cases
belong
in
state
court.
there
is
a
state
tort
claims
act
that
took
effect
on
june
1,
1982.
it
does
not
apply
in
this
case.
however,
it
was
enacted
after
parratt,
perhaps
in
response
to
parratt.
it
remains
on
the
books
as
long
as
parratt
remains
on
the
books.
it
does
not
apply
in
cases
in
which
a
prisoner
asks
for
more
than
$25,000.
the
statute
keeps
all--
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
--no,
sir,
it
does
not.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
i
think
the
proper
characterization
of
it,
justice
stevens...
and
i
hesitate
before
answering...
is
more
in
the
nature
of
substantive
due
process
despite
by
hesitancy
in
light
of
the
attack
made
by
the
solicitor
general
in
the
next
case.
i
hesitate
but
i
do
not
back
away
from
that
statement.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
it
is
our
contention
that
the
solicitor
general
must
prevail,
must,
if
the
only
way
our
petitioner
could
win
the
case
is
for
the
court
to
hold
that
every
state
tort
is
a
1983
tort.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
justice
o'connor,
we
conceded
that
a
qualified
immunity,
such
as
this
court
has
already
held
under
1983,
is
adequate.
it
would
clearly,
if
applied
by
state
in
its
own
tort
system,
if
adequate
for
federal
purposes,
it
certainly
would
not
be
a
denial
of
a
meaningful
remedy.
and,
we
think
that
takes
care
of
a
lot
of
the
problems
of
anticipating
decisions,
the
failure
to
anticipate
decisions
before
they
are
announced.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
yes.
and,
in
fact,
if
that
were
the
only
defense,
both
a
state
tort
claim
and
a
1983
suit
in
state
court
could
be
brought
together
and
the
same
defense
would
apply
to
both.
may
i
reserve
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal?
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
justice
white,
very
few...
the
cases
where
it
does
apply
are
cases
in
which
after
the
court
clearly
announces
a
decision
such
as
you
must
do
this
to
conform
to
the
due
process
clause,
someone
doesn't
know
about
it
but
should
have
known.
that
is
probably
the
only
case.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
mr.
chief
justice,
yes.
i
would
like
to
answer
a
question
justice
white
posed
with
respect
to
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
with
respect
to
state
sovereign
immunity.
it
is
true,
justice
white,
that
a
majority
of
six
of
the
court
of
appeals
expressed
the
view
that
there
were
several
virginia
supreme
court
cases
which
would
suggest
that
there
wouldn't
be
sovereign
immunity.
it
is
also
true
that
respondent's
position
was
and
is
that
there
is
sovereign
immunity
in
this
case.
an
assistant
attorney
general,
arguing
companion
cases
which
were
argued
together
with
this
and
questions
were
put,
indicated
that
he
supported
the
view
there
was
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
well,
justice
white,
we
believe--
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
--surely
the
attorney
general
of
virginia
above
me
and
the
court
of
appeals,
of
course,
but
our
position
is...
and
i
didn't
want
this
to
be
missed...
that
it
is
not
a
meaningful
remedy
in
a
suit
where
in
a
state
like
virginia
in
order
to
litigate
this
this
prisoner
would
have
had
to
go
to
state
court,
might
never
have
gotten
a
final
resolution.
this
has
gone
to
a
jury,
traditional
jury
trial
in
the
circuit
court
of
virginia.
a
general
verdict
might
never
have
declared
whether
there
was
or
was
not
sovereign
immunity.
if
the
virginia
supreme
court
did
not
review
this
case,
and
it
reviews
very
few
as
this
court
probably
knows,
there
would
not
be
an
answer.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
that
is
correct,
justice
rehnquist,
but
it
did
not
exist
at
this
time
and
there
was
no
right
of
review
for
this
prisoner.
and,
the
question
we
put
to
this
court
is
whether
it
is
truly
a
meaningful
remedy
when
the
petitioner
judges
that
the
sovereign
immunity
defense
is
likely
to
succeed,
the
respondent
believes
it
will
succeed,
his
counsel
believes
it
will
succeed,
he
so
represents
to
the
court--
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
--yes,
justice
white,
maybe.
if,
in
fact,
this
prisoner
is
allowed
to
file
in
federal
court
and
keep
a
federal
suit
alive.
under
tamoneo
we
might
lose
under
the
statute
of
limitations.
our
position
is
that
is
a
bad
way
to
run
a
state
court
system
and
a
federal
system.
it
delays
recovery,
it
delays
the
protection
for
the
prisoner
perhaps
for
a
very
long
time.
if
that
is
meaningful,
then
we
will
lose.
the
last
point,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
the
martinez
case
is
cited
a
great
length
in
the
brief,
although
not
here
in
the
argument.
this
court
carefully
left
open
in
martinez
the
question
of
what
kind
of
immunity
would
be
recognized
for
1983
purposes.
it
did
not,
as
suggested
in
the
brief,
say
that
state
immunity
would
automatically
be
accepted
if
they
were
rational.
left
it
open
and
said
that
is
a
question
we
will
address
another
day.
that
question
is
now
here.
the
last
thing
i
would
say
is
this
case
may
boil
down
to
this
and
when
the
court
judges
first
question
put
by
respondent
as
to
what
the
intent
of
the
congress
was
when
it
enacted
section
1983.
his
position
is
that
if
a
prisoner
in
the
custody
of
a
sheriff
were
negligently
stolen
away
and
lynched,
there
would
have
been
no
remedy
in
a
federal
court
even
after
the
state
courts'
doors
were
closed.
our
position
is
that
that
is
wrong.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
yes,
justice
powell.
my
time
is
up.
might
i
answer
that
with
another
sentence?
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
our
position
is
in
that
specific
fact
situation,
yes,
he
should
be
able
to
sue
under
1983.
it
would
be
possible,
however,
for
the
court
to
say
that
where
a
prisoner
avails
himself
of
benefits
that
are
not
imposed
upon
him,
for
example,
educational
benefits
and
certain
medical
benefits,
that
he
knowingly
chooses
to
avail
himself
of
that
are
not
imposed
upon
him
against
his
will,
that
simple
negligence
in
that
context
ought
to
be
no
different
from
negligence
for
any
other
person.
it
is
not
in
this
case.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
at
his
request
for
special
medical
treatment?
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
it
might
very
well
make
a
difference.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
thank
you.
