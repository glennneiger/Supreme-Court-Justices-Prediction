justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
saltzburg,
can
i
ask
this
question
that
your
argument
prompts?
supposing...
assuming
there
is
immunity
for
sovereign
immunity
of
some
kind
for
the
officer
as
a
matter
of
virginia
law
here.
supposing
there
was
a
guest
or
a
visitor
in
the
prison
who
was
with
the
prisoner
and
they
both
slipped
on
the
pillow
and
were
injured
as
a
result
of
the
guard's
negligence.
in
your
view,
the
prisoner
would
have
a
right
because
he
is
in
his
custody.
what
about
the
guest?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
again?
if
i
understood
you
correctly,
you
said
they
should
not
be
deprived
of
the
protection
they
previously
had
had.
the
assumption
i
was
making
is
that
as
a
matter
of
virginia
law
the
sovereign
immunity
defense
protected
both
the
prisoner
and
the
guest
before
the
1983
was
enacted,
therefore,
the
effect
of
the
statute
as
you
construe
it
would
be
to
give
an
extra
protection
to
the
prisoner
that
nobody
else
in
the
commonwealth
had.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
if
you
would
characterize
your
due
process
claim
in
this
case
as
a
procedural
due
process
claim
or
a
substantive
due
process
claim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
that
is
the
thrust
of
your
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
whether
there
is
an
adequate
state
remedy
in
your
hypothetical?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
just
assuming
it
for
the
hypothetical.
you
know
what
the
law
is
in
virginia
though?
i
mean,
in
most
of
these
cases,
is
there
or
is
there
not
a
sovereign
immunity
defense
is
what
i
am
trying
to
figure
out.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
just
explain
to
me
why,
if
we
focus
on
the
word
"deprivation"
just
for
a
moment,
why
the
mental
state
of
the
person
who
does
the
depriving
has
anything
to
do
with
whether
a
deprivation
occurred?
say
you
talk
about
deprivation
of
life
and
some
guy
gets
wrongfully
executed.
would
it
make
much
difference
whether
it
was
done
deliberately
or
they
just
had
a
misidentification
by
mistake?
wouldn't
it
equally
be
a
deprivation
of
life?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
it
was
negligent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
it
is
on
life
and
property,
why
is
it
different
on
liberty?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
give
you
one
other
hypothetical
that
occurs
to
me
as
a
result
of
justice
rehnquist's
question.
supposing
your
sovereign
immunity
doctrine
were
much
clearer
than
it
is.
you
had
a
black
and
white
rule,
the
state
has
waived
sovereign
immunity
in
all
cases
except
when
a
prisoner
litigates.
would
you
think
that
would
stand
up,
because
we
don't
like
suits
by
prisoners,
they
are
mostly
harassing,
you
know,
they
waste
a
lot
of
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
surely
wouldn't
be
wholly
irrational.
it
would
save
the
commonwealth
a
lot
of
money.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
clearly
prevail
on
your...
if
your
first
argument
is
right,
you
would
still
definitely
win
because
it
doesn't
come
in.
i
am
just
wondering
how
your
second
argument
would
treat
that
kind
of
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
your
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
is,
first,
there
is
no
deprivation
of
liberty
because
it
is
a
negligence
case.
if
you
win
on
that,
you
win
no
matter
what
the
sovereign
immunity
situation
is.
your
second
argument
is
that
in
all
events
there
has
been
no
deprivation
of
due
process
because
he
has
the
same
rights
as
other
citizens
and
sovereign
immunity
is
just
something
all
citizens
have
to
confront.
then
i
am
saying
what
if
all
citizens
don't
have
to
confront
it,
just
prisoners,
then
i
am
just
wondering
whether
you
would
still
say
there
was
no
denial
of
due
process.
justice
john
paul
stevens
reason
for
that.
