justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
was
in
the
days
of
swift
against
tyson,
wasn't
it?
i
mean
south
against
maryland
really
doesn't
have
any
very
direct
application
today.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
suggesting,
mr.
saltzburg,
that
the
fourteenth
amendment...
the
due
process
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
imposes
more
stringent
restrictions
upon
states
than
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
does
on
the
federal
government?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then,
are
you
relying
on
anything
other
than
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
let's
break
that
down
a
minute.
i
understood
your
claim
was
brought
under
1983.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and,
that
the
reason
that
you
are
suing
is
because
1983
gives
you
a
right
to
recover
for
a
violation
of
your
constitutional
rights.
the
violation
of
your
constitutional
right
was
a
deprivation
of
liberty
without
due
process
of
law.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
did
the
1866
and
1871
statutes
have
anything
to
do
with
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
all
that
does
is
get
you
into
court,
as
i
would
say,
to
assert
your
constitutional
claim.
it
doesn't
define
the
limits
of
your
constitution
claim.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
all
the
talk
about
congress
knew
that
keepers
of
prisoners
had
duties,
how
does
that
fit
into
your
argument?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
would
the
same
liability
be
here
on
a
bevins
claim
against
a
federal
prison
warden
in
the
same
situation
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
south
against
maryland
wasn't
speaking
of
federal
officials,
was
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
say
that
is
an
intentional
deprivation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
saltzburg,
a
moment
ago
in
answering
the
chief
justice's
question
you
said
you
don't
ask
to
have
the
federal
sovereign
immunity
declared
invalid.
i
take
it
you
are
not
asking
to
have
the
state
sovereign
immunity
declared
invalid
either.
if
virginia
chooses
to
retain
sovereign
immunity,
then
these
people
have
their
cases
tried
in
the
federal
district
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
it
have
a
repealer
clause
in
case
parratt
is
overruled?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
hopper,
let
me
interrupt
you
and
get
back
for
a
moment...
i
fear
i
may
be
confused.
i
thought
that
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
there
was
an
adequate
remedy
under
virginia
law.
am
i
wrong
in
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and,
you
are
here
now
saying
there
isn't
an
adequate
remedy
under
virginia
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
how
do
you
differ
from
the
court
of
appeals
with
respect
to
the
adequacy
of
the
virginia
remedy?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
hopper,
supposing
in
this
case
instead
of
the
petitioner
slipping
going
down
the
stairs
the
trustee
or
deputy
had
intentionally
shoved
him
down
the
stairs
intending
to
injure
him.
would
you
say
that
that
was
a
federal
constitutional
violation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
suppose
you
can
always
prevent
yourself
from
intentionally
shoving
somebody
else
down
the
stairs.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let's
say
a
guard,
a
guard.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
hopper,
tell
me
once
more
what
your
position
here
is
about
the
availability
of
sovereign
immunity
in
the
event
the
petitioner
were
to
bring
his
case
in
virginia.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
there
would
be
no
sovereign
immunity.
your
position
is
what?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
have
got
a
virginia
intermediate
court
of
appeals
knows
that
presumably
review
more
cases.
