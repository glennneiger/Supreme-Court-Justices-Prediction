justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
think
you
are
talking
just
about
prisons?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
negligence
would...
there
wouldn't
be
many
occasions
where
the
defense
would
apply
in
the
negligence
section.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
the
court
of
appeals
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
it
was
not
available
in
virginia.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
shouldn't
we
take
that
as
the
law
of
virginia?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
suggest
we
should
just
say
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
understand
virginia
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
aren't
they
more
likely
to
understand
virginia
law
than
we
are?
several
of
them
are
virginia
lawyers,
aren't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
sovereign
immunity
in
virginia
now
exists
only
to
the
extent
it
has
been
declared
and
it
has
never
been
declared
with
respect
to
a
prison
guard.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
suggest
the
inference
is
the
court
of
appeals
was
quite
correct
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
what...
they
have
said
we
never
had
sovereign
immunity
until
now
and
now
we
are
going
to
have
it
here,
there,
but
they
have
never
said
about
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
have
never
touched
on
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
lower
courts?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
say
that
there
is
sovereign
immunity.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
say
that
it
was
an
adequate
remedy
even
though
sovereign
immunity
is
available.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
that
certainly
isn't
the
thrust
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
byron
r.
white
can
you
just
say
that
it
would?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
as
between
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
attorney
general
of
the
commonwealth,
whose
words
do
we
take?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
might
have
been
a
professor
from
the
virginia
law
school.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
it
does,
and
then
it
does
succeed
in
the
state
court,
so
it
hasn't
been
a
meaningful
remedy,
then
you
are
around
the
mulberry
bush
again.
