justice

day
o'connor
mr.
saltzburg,
can
you
explain
why
you
think
the
drafters
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
were
concerned
with
possible
state
law
negligence
actions
by
state
officers?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
failing
to
act
consciously
by
reference
to
the
word
"deprive",
don't
we
have
to
look
at
that
word
in
the
clause
and
inquire
whether
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
word
"deprive"
means
an
intentional
rather
than
a
unintentional
kind
of
an
act
or
discrimination?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
saltzburg,
you
have
probably
already
answered
this
adequately,
but
let
me
ask
anyway
whether,
as
far
as
you
are
concerned,
it
is
clear
that
in
virginia
the
state
law
is
such
that
a
state
officer
sued
in
his
individual
capacity
has
an
absolute
defense
based
on
sovereign
immunity.
you
are
satisfied
that
that
is
the
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
when
sued
in
their
individual
capacities?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but,
shouldn't
the
word
"deprivation"
have
the
same
meaning
regardless
of
the
context
in
which
the
suit
arises?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
saltzburg,
if
the
court
were
to
hold
that
negligent
infliction
of
harm
to
a
prisoner
by
a
state
official
does
state
a
claim,
how
would
you
propose
to
handle
defenses
for
qualified
immunity?
is
inadvertence
always
a
defense?
would
it
ever
be
a
defense?
how
do
you
handle
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
it
could
always
be
a
defense
in
state
law?
