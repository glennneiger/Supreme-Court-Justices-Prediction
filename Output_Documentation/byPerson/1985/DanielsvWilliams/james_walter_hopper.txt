mr.
james
walter
hopper
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
garden
variety
slip
and
fall
case,
a
common
law
tort.
it
occurred
in
a
jail
and
it
caused
bodily
injury
to
a
prisoner.
it
was
said
to
have
occurred
due
to
the
simple
negligence
of
a
deputy
sheriff
leaving
a
pillow
and
some
newspapers
on
the
stairs
used
by
the
prisoner.
we
wish
today
to
address
by
way
of
argument
two
points.
our
first
point
is
that
an
act
of
simple
negligence
by
a
deputy
sheriff
causing
unintended
bodily
injury
should
not
constitute
a
deprivation
of
liberty
in
the
constitutional
sense.
our
second
point
is
that
even
if
an
act
of
simple
negligence
constitutes
a
deprivation
in
the
constitutional
sense,
a
state
law
defense
such
as
the
defense
of
sovereign
immunity,
does
not
violate
due
process
when
it
operates
to
preclude
recovery.
we
believe
that
the
petitioner
here
has
assumed
that
as
a
prisoner
his
interest
in
freedom
from
personal
injury
is
a
liberty
interest
that
is
protected
by
the
due
process
clause
and
we
believe
that
this
assumption
of
his
is
based
largely
upon
the
fact
of
his
incarceration.
as
a
result
of
his
incarceration,
he
believes
that
a
special
duty
is
owed
to
him
to
keep
him
absolutely
free
of
tortious
injury.
he
argues
that
an
act
of
simple
negligence
by
a
deputy
sheriff
in
this
case
constitutes
a
deprivation
of
this
liberty
interest
and
he
argues
that
there
is,
in
fact,
an
absolute
state
defense
of
sovereign
immunity
such
that
no
state
recovery
would
be
allowed,
therefore,
he
has
concluded
that
this
deprivation
has
occurred
without
due
process
of
law.
we
submit
that
if
the
petitioner's
basic
argument
is
accepted,
almost
any
negligent
tort
that
is
committed
by
a
guard
or
a
deputy
sheriff,
depending
on
the
availability
of
a
state
tort
remedy,
could
be
considered
a
deprivation
of
a
liberty
interest
without
due
process
of
law.
for
example,
if
a
prison
guard
or
a
deputy
sheriff
could
have
an
automobile
accident
resulting
from
his
simple
negligence
when
he
is
taking
a
prisoner
to
or
from
court
for
a
hearing,
if
an
injury
has
occurred
to
that
prisoner
and
there
is
no
adequate
state
remedy,
then
it
can
be
said
that
a
deprivation
of
a
liberty
interest
has
occurred
in
that
set
of
facts.
mr.
james
walter
hopper
justice
stevens,
i
am
assuming
in
the
hypothetical
i
just
proposed
that
there
would
not
be
a
state
remedy.
mr.
james
walter
hopper
justice
stevens,
with
respect,
the
law
in
virginia
is
not
clear
as
to
this
particular,
unique
government
official,
a
deputy
sheriff,
and
it
is
subject
to
constant
review
by
the
courts
of
record
in
the
commonwealth.
mr.
james
walter
hopper
justice
white,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
they
thought
that
sovereign
immunity
defense
had
no
part
in
this
case.
mr.
james
walter
hopper
and
that
it
was
not
available.
mr.
james
walter
hopper
with
respect,
justice
white,
the
case
relied
on
by
the
fourth
circuit
was
an
1826
case.
mr.
james
walter
hopper
with
respect,
justice
white,
yes.
mr.
james
walter
hopper
with
respect,
justice
rehnquist,
they
ought
to.
i
do
not
agree
with
their
conclusion
in
this
case,
however.
if
i
may,
the
reason
i
do
not
agree
is
because,
again,
they
relied
on
an
1826
case.
sovereign
immunity
was
not
recognized
by
the
virginia
supreme
court
until
1839,
it
was
not
then
further
developed
until
1849.
therefore,
the
case
that
the
fourth
circuit
has
relied
upon,
i
would
submit,
arose
prior
to
sovereign
immunity
ever
even
being
discussed
within
the
commonwealth
of
virginia.
mr.
james
walter
hopper
justice
white,
that
is
correct.
petitioner
urges--
mr.
james
walter
hopper
--respectfully,
justice
white,
i
do
not
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
james
walter
hopper
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
walter
hopper
that
is
correct,
justice
white.
the
highest
court
of
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
has
not
spoken.
mr.
james
walter
hopper
there
are
numerous
circuit
courts
of
the
commonwealth
of
virginia,
justice
white,
which
deal
with
this
issue.
mr.
james
walter
hopper
justice
white,
with
respect,
they
are
divided
and
the
reason
they
are
divided
is
because
the
court
of
record
in
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
engages
in
a
determination
of
whether
the
act
being
performed
is
discretionary
or
ministerial.
the
petition
in
this
case,
however,
urges
that
a
special
duty
is
owed
to
prisoners
because
they
are
in
the
complete
control
of
the
state
and
he
argues
here
perhaps
that
the
prisoner
had
no
choice
but
to
go
down
the
stairs
upon
which
he
fell.
mr.
james
walter
hopper
no,
justice
rehnquist,
you
are
not
wrong.
they
did
hold
that
there
was
an
adequate
remedy
under
virginia
law.
mr.
james
walter
hopper
no,
justice
rehnquist,
i
am
saying
that
there
is
an
adequate
remedy
under
virginia
law.
mr.
james
walter
hopper
i
do
not,
justice
rehnquist,
differ
with
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
adequacy
of
the
virginia
remedy.
i
differ
only
with
the
court
of
appeals
on
whether
sovereign
immunity
applies
to
this
particular
officer.
mr.
james
walter
hopper
justice
white,
yes,
it
would
be
my--
mr.
james
walter
hopper
--i
understand
that,
justice
white.
again,
referring
to
the
example
that
justice
stevens
alluded
to
earlier,
where
is
the
difference
if
an
individual
comes
to
the
very
same
jail
where
this
petitioner
was
housed
and
he
had
to
go
see
the
petitioner
on
a
cold
and
icy
day
in
january?
the
jail
only
has
one
entrance
which
has
a
number
of
steps
to
it.
let's
suppose
in
this
hypothetical
that
the
deputy
sheriff
who
is
in
charge
of
the
outside
of
this
jail
is
charged
with
various
duties
including...
various
duties
which
would
include
keeping
ice
and
snow
from
the
steps
and
this
visitor,
although
not
with
the
prisoner,
is
coming
to
see
the
prisoner,
slips
on
these
steps
and
has
bodily
injury
as
a
result
of
the
negligence
of
the
deputy
sheriff.
this
visitor
is
then
confronted
with
the
identical
sovereign
immunity
defense
that
we
have
here.
the
only
apparent
difference
in
the
status
of
the
case
is
the
status
of
the
individuals.
yet,
under
petitioner's
theory,
one
must
conclude
that
the
visitor
would
have
no
remedy,
either
in
the
federal
or
the
state
courts
because
of
the
operation
of
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
james
walter
hopper
justice
marshall,
that
is
what
the
petitioner
has
just
said,
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
walter
hopper
no,
sir.
the
visitor
would
be
a
voluntary
visitor.
mr.
james
walter
hopper
justice
marshall,
that
is
correct.
that
is
what
he
says.
mr.
james
walter
hopper
that
is
correct.
petitioner
argues
that
the
due
process
clause
though
is
not
violated
the
moment
that
the
tortious
injury
occurs.
he
says
that
his
now
may
be
a
substantive
due
process
claim.
yet
he
has
said
in
his
petition
that
the
due
process
rights
are
not
violated
until
there
is
no
state
remedy
available
to
him.
yet
surely
i
think
we
would
all
have
to
agree
that
this
injury
could
not
have
been
inflicted
by
the
deputy
sheriff
on
the
petitioner
even
if
a
pre-deprivation
hearing
were
held,
simply
because
no
process
would
ever
justify
inflicting
an
injury
on
anyone's
person.
the
fact
of
the
hearing
or
the
lack
thereof
does
not
affect
this
injury.
petitioner's
basic
position,
we
believe
then,
is
really
that
his
loss
should
not
go
without
compensation.
in
essence,
he
argues
for
the
best
of
all
possible
worlds.
unfortunately,
in
virginia,
it
is
not
the
best
of
all
possible
worlds.
there
are
not
only
the
sovereign
immunity
defense,
but
other
official
immunity
defenses
such
as
prosecutorial,
judicial,
witness,
parole
board,
legislative
immunities.
therefore,
citizens
in
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
may
be
injured
by
the
actions
of
governmental
officials
but
do
not
always
have
a
tort
remedy
available
to
them
against
either
the
official
or
the
government
which
he
represents
in
virginia.
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
sovereign
immunity
was
not
recognized
in
virginia
until
1839.
the
virginia
tort
claims
act,
however,
did
not
become
effective
until
july
1,
1982.
the
tort
claims
act,
however,
does
not
do
away
with
the
immunity
of
local
government
or
local
governments'
employees.
consequently,
the
petitioner
is
not
unique
in
virginia
in
suffering
injury
at
the
hands
of
government
or
local
government
and
being
without
a
tort
remedy.
in
fact,
individuals
who
have
been
injured
by
government
negligence
have
suffered
injuries
at
least
equal
to
and
sometimes
greater
than
that
of
the
petitioner.
examples
are
readily
found
on
pages
32
and
33
of
the
petitioner's
brief.
messina
versus
burden
interestingly
enough
was
a
slip
and
fall
case
on
some
steps
of
a
community
college
in
virginia.
hinchey
versus
ogden
represents
the
other
end
of
the
extreme
where
the
plaintiff
lost
a
leg
and
part
of
her
buttocks.
in
both
of
these
cases,
however,
the
plaintiff
was
without
any
remedy
in
state
law
at
all
because
of
the
operation
of
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity.
we
don't
think
that
predicaments
like
these
or
that
of
the
petitioner's
have
breached
anything
found
in
the
constitution.
it
has
been
held
that
when
a
state
law
creates
a
cause
of
action
and
the
state
is
free
to
define
the
defenses
for
that
claim,
including
the
defense
of
immunity,
unless
the
state
law
is
in
conflict
with
the
federal
law.
mr.
james
walter
hopper
justice
rehnquist,
would
i
also
have
to
assume...
respectfully
have
to
assume
in
the
hypothetical
that
the
deputy
was
in
a
position
to
prevent
that
injury?
mr.
james
walter
hopper
i
am
sorry,
justice
rehnquist,
i
understood
you
to
say
a
trustee
which
meant
to
me
another
inmate.
mr.
james
walter
hopper
all
right,
sir.
if
a
guard
were
to
intentionally
push
the
plaintiff
down
the
stairs--
mr.
james
walter
hopper
--that
is
a
closer
question,
justice
rehnquist,
and
may
well
create
a
constitutional
deprivation
in
a
constitutional
sense
because
of
the
intentional
act
of
the
deputy
sheriff
or
guard.
mr.
james
walter
hopper
there
again,
justice
white,
if
it
is--
mr.
james
walter
hopper
--yes,
chief
justice
burger,
they
are.
and,
if
this
were
an
intentional
tort,
then--
mr.
james
walter
hopper
--that
is
correct,
chief
justice
burger.
in
addition
to--
mr.
james
walter
hopper
--that
is
correct,
chief
justice
burger.
and,
in
addition,
there
would
be
a
remedy
under
virginia
law;
i
think,
both
tort
and
criminal
law,
in
that
hypothetical.
mr.
james
walter
hopper
yes,
sir.
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
james
walter
hopper
justice
o'connor,
again
the
question
becomes
closer
as
you
get
into
gross
negligence.
in
gross
negligence,
there
is
a
reckless
disregard
by
the
actor.
we
are
in
a
position
of
conceding
that
the
degree
of
gross
negligence
may
well
give
rise
to
a
constitutional
deprivation.
mr.
james
walter
hopper
justice
stevens,
yes,
it
would
be
a
deprivation
of
life
in
that
kind
of--
mr.
james
walter
hopper
--justice
stevens,
i
would...
the
only
guidance
that
i
have
in
answering
that
question
would
be
parratt
versus
taylor
and
parratt
versus
taylor
has
contradictory
language
but
would
seem
to
indicate
that
that
negligent
act
would
constitute
a
deprivation
at
least
so
far
as--
mr.
james
walter
hopper
--justice
stevens,
intellectually
it
should
not
be
different.
however,
as
justice
o'connor
has
pointed
out,
the
word
1983
and
the
due
process
clause
and
we
believe
that
in
the
due
process
sense,
the
due
process
clause,
it
should
be
limited
to
the
deliberate
actions
of
state
officials
which
are
designed
to
take
away
those
constitutional
interests,
simply
because
historically
the
guarantee
of
due
process
has
been
applied
only
to
the
deliberate
decisions
of
government
to
consciously
take
away
life,
liberty,
or
property.
surely
is
our
position
that
the
framers
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
left
room
in
the
due
process
clause
to
recognize
that
government
must
conduct
its
affairs
for
the
benefit
of
the
general
population
through
people.
those
people
will
occasionally
commit
error
as
human
beings.
otherwise--
mr.
james
walter
hopper
--mr.
chief
justice,
logically
it
may,
but
monroe
versus
pape
was
dealing
with
that
same
type
of
situation
where,
i
believe,
the
argument
was
that
those
officers
were
acting
outside
the
scope
of
their
authority.
but,
for
the
purposes
of
state
action,
it
was
held
that
they
were
within
the
scope
of
their
authority.
the
suggestion
that
you
make
in
the
due
process
sense
may
well
provide
a
bright
line
or
a
clear
division
to
view
a
"deprivation"
in
the
constitutional
sense.
if
we
may
now
turn
to
our
second
point,
that
is
even
if
an
act
of
simple
negligence
by
a
deputy
sheriff
constitutes
a
deprivation
in
the
constitutional
sense,
then
the
sovereign
immunity
defense
does
not
violate
due
process
when
it
precludes
recovery.
on
this
point,
we
have
some
difficulty
speaking
on
behalf
of
the
commonwealth
as
to
her
rationale
for
not
providing
an
opportunity
to
this
plaintiff
to
receive
money
damages
simply
because
of
the
status
of
the
deputy
sheriff.
he
is
neither
a
state
employee
nor
is
he
a
government
employee,
he
is
simply
a
deputy...
a
constitutional
officer
under
the
virginia
constitution
and
the
virginia
code.
his
position
is
funded
by
a
formula
of
both
state
and
local
funds.
the
virginia
tort
claims
act
does
not
apply
to
him,
nor
is
he
afforded
representation
by
the
state
attorney
general's
office.
similarly,
the
municipality
does
not
exercise
any
control
over
him
and
he
is
not
offered
representation
by
the
city
attorney's
office.
on
the
other
hand,
if
he
were
a
local
government
employee,
he
would
be
not
covered
by
the
tort
claims
act,
however,
he
would
be
extended
sovereign
immunity
for
simple
acts
of
negligence
while
performing
discretionary
functions.
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
the
deputy
sheriff
in
virginia
occupies
an
unique
position
as
a
public
official
in
virginia's
scheme
of
government.
several
of
the
courts
of
the
commonwealth,
the
courts
of
record,
have
extended
to
him
the
defense
of
sovereign
immunity
for
acts
of
simple
negligence
while
performing
discretionary
functions.
on
the
other
hand,
he
has
also
been
denied
such
a
defense
by
several
of
the
other
courts
of
the
commonwealth
depending
on
what
the
court
considers
to
be
a
discretionary
function.
here,
the
petitioner
maintains
that
the
sovereign
immunity
defense
is
absolute
and
that
it
will
bar
any
action
brought
in
the
state
court.
he
argues
that
the
state
has
created
a
system
of
civil
compensation
for
tort
victims.
in
this
case,
however,
the
state
does
not
provide
him
with
compensation
for
his
particular
injury.
he
says
without
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
on
the
merits
of
his
claim
in
state
court,
he
has
been
deprived
of
his
liberty
without
due
process
of
law.
in
the
best
of
all
possible
worlds,
the
petitioner's
loss
probably
should
not
go
without
compensation.
however,
should
the
respondent
prevail
in
the
state
court
on
the
defense
of
sovereign
immunity,
he
will
not
receive
compensation
for
his
injury.
mr.
james
walter
hopper
my
position,
justice
rehnquist,
is
that
there
would
be
sovereign
immunity
because
this
individual
was
performing
discretionary
acts
and
an
act
of
alleged
simple
negligence
is
alleged
against
him
while
performing
those
discretionary
acts.
mr.
james
walter
hopper
that
is
correct,
justice
blackmun,
not
taking
the
pillow
or
the
newspapers
from
the
stairway.
mr.
james
walter
hopper
it
has
never
been
the
law,
we
believe,
that
a
state
violates
due
process
whenever
it
makes
available
substantive
or
procedural
rules
of
tort
law
which
on
occasion
preclude
individuals
from
obtaining
relief
for
certain
injuries
caused
by
state
actors.
the
states
have
been
permitted
to
erect
reasonable,
procedural
requirements
for
triggering
the
right
of
adjudication
such
as
statutes
of
limitations
and
filing
fees.
it
is
only--
mr.
james
walter
hopper
--justice
stevens,
in
answer
to
your
question,
i
think
that
we
would
have
to
determine
whether
that
decision
was
wholly
arbitrary
or
irrational.
mr.
james
walter
hopper
we
would
have
to
weigh
then
a
balancing,
if
you
will,
of
the
private
interest
against
the
public
interest
and
the
public
interest
of
maintaining
orderly
administration
of
its
jails
and
prisons
may
very
well
outweigh
the
interest
of
the
prisoner
to
bring
a
suit
in
the
courts
of
the
commonwealth
and
receive
compensation
for
that.
i
cannot
give
you
a
blanket
answer
because
i
think
that
it
would
depend--
mr.
james
walter
hopper
--the
second
argument
being
a
balancing
of
the
governmental
interest,
justice
stevens
in
your
hypothetical?
mr.
james
walter
hopper
justice
stevens,
i
would
come
down
on
the
side
that
there
would
be
no
denial
of
due
process
assuming
that
there
was
a
wholly
rational
and
not
arbitrary
reason
for
that.
mr.
james
walter
hopper
and,
the
legislature
would
make
that
determination
at
some
point
in
its
deliberations.
in
the
recent
case,
however,
of
messina
versus
burden,
the
virginia
supreme
court
has
stated
that
sovereign
immunity
serves
a
multitude
of
government
interest
in
this
case
and
these
include
not
only
those
that
petitioner
alluded
to
earlier,
which
was
protecting
the
public
purse,
but
a
number
of
others,
among
which
were
eliminating
public
inconvenience
and
danger
that
might
spring
from
officials
being
fearful
to
act,
assuring
that
citizens
would
be
willing
to
take
public
jobs
and
also
preventing
citizens
from
improperly
influencing
the
conduct
of
governmental
affairs
through
threat
or
the
use
of
vexatious
litigations.
the
virginia
court
has
also
noted
that
government
can
only
function
through
servants
such
as
this
deputy
sheriff
and
that
certain
of
those
servants
much
enjoy
the
same
immunity
in
the
performance
of
those
discretionary
functions
as
the
government
enjoys.
given
the
continued
validity
of
the
sovereign
immunity
doctrine
in
virginia,
the
virginia
supreme
court
has
acknowledged
that
it
must
continue
to
engage
in
a
very
difficult
task
of
deciding
which
government
employees
are
entitled
to
immunity
based
on
the
nature
of
their
acts,
either
discretionary
or
ministerial,
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
such
rationale,
we
believe,
reflects
what
virginia
considers
to
be
some
of
the
important
purposes
of
the
immunity
defense
which
benefits
society
as
a
whole
in
virginia.
the
balance
of
state
and
private
interests
favors
the
government's
interest
in
this
sense
and
it
is
rashly
related
to
a
legitimate
state
interest,
that
of
jail
or
prison
administration
in
this
particular
instance.
it
has
been
held
that
immunity
rules
do
not
in
and
of
themselves
deny
due
process.
we
believe
that
such
rules
do
not
deny
process
simply
by
limiting
the
state
remedy
available
to
this
petitioner.
we
believe
that
to
agree
with
petitioner
that
his
procedural
due
process
rights
have
been
violated
by
the
immunity
defense
would
result
in
common
law
torts
becoming
section
1983
cases
in
the
federal
courts.
the
constitutional
question
then
is
whether
state
procedures,
including
sovereign
immunity
defenses,
provide
the
petitioner
with
the
process
required
under
the
due
process
clause.
we
urge
this
court
to
conclude
that
virginia's
procedures
in
this
case
do,
in
fact,
comply
with
the
due
process
clause.
thank
you.
