mr.
lee,
i
can't
let
you
go
through
an
entire
argument
without
interrupting.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
to
raise
this
question
that
your
argument
troubles
me
with.
you
start
out
with
your
three
different
issues
and
say
the
ultimate
issue
is
whether
the
contract,
i
guess
you
are
saying,
prevents
the
company
from
laying
off
workers
in
chicago
when
there
is
no
shortage
of
jobs
in
chicago.
i
suppose
if
you
describe
that
as
the
ultimate
issue,
you
are
saying
that
there
can
be
two
views
of
whether
the
contract
so
permits.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
there
are
two
views
of
what
the
contract
could
mean,
are
you
not
conceding
that
the
issue
is
arbitrable
and
therefore,
although
the
court
of
appeals
adopted
the
wrong
rationale,
that
your
opponent
is
right
on
the
issue
of
arbitrability?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
i
have
in
mind,
of
course,
is
the
language
of
article
viii
of
the
agreement,
they
failed
to
settle
by
negotiation.
differences
arising
with
respect
to
the
interpretation
of
the
contract.
it
seems
to
me
there
is
a
difference
between
you
and
your
adversary
as
to
meaning
of
the
contract
on
the
ultimate
issue.
that
is
what
i
am--
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
you
mean,
i
guess,
is,
it
is
a
harmless
error
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
gold,
can
i
take
you
back
for
moment
to
the
western
electric
case?
you
were
telling
us
that
it
is
not
a
very
impressive
body
of
judicial
opinion.
but
as
i
understand
your
opponent's
use
of
it,
he
is
not
so
much
talking
about
it
as
a
legal
authority
but
rather
as
sort
of
a
factual
interpretation
of
the
identical
provision
in
the
agreement
that
is
at
issue
here.
and
my
question
to
you
is,
do
you
think
it
permissible
in
doing
what
a
judge
is
supposed
to
do
on
a
case
like
this
to
go
beyond
the
four
corners
of
the
agreement
and
look
at
bargaining
history
and
factual
matters
such
as
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
this
agreement
turned
out
to
be
the
case
on
all
fours
as
far
as
the
factual
pattern,
you
know,
moving
people
from
one
place
to
another,
and
there
was
another
letter
that
said
this
is
the
way
we
have
always
interpreted
this
particular
article
for
the
last
20
years
throughout
the
country
and
the
union
agreed.
could
they
put
that
kind
of
evidence
before
the
judge?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
you
don't
think
it's
this
kind
of
evidence.
i
am
not
suggesting
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
would
agree,
would
you
not,
that
the
bargaining
history
ought
to
relate
to
the
question
whether
the
dispute
is
arbitrable
rather
than
the
merits
of
the
dispute?
