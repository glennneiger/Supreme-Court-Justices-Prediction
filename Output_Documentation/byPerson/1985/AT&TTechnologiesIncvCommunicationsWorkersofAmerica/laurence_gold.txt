mr.
laurence
e.
gold
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
petitioner's
claim
here
is
that
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
failed
to
fulfill
their
judicial
functions
in
determining
whether
or
not
to
order
arbitration
of
the
union's
grievance
in
this
case.
and
in
order
to
evaluate
that
claim,
it
seems
to
me
one
has
to
in
a
bit
more
detail
than
petitioners
do
and
with
a
closer
attention
to
the
nature
of
the
case
determine
what
under
this
court's
precedence
the
lower
courts
were
required
to
do.
we
do
not,
and
we
have
made
it
plain,
agree
with
every
word
the
seventh
circuit
used
in
stating
its
views,
but
this
is
not
the
high
court
of
linguistic
purity,
and
the
question
is
whether
in
substance
the
court
of
appeals
got
it
right.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
well,
we
are
concerned
that
we
are
able
to
demonstrate
to
you
that
they
did
get
to
the
right
place,
and
obviously,
given
the
function
of
this
court,
we
are
concerned
to
be
of
what
aid
we
can
in
assuring
that
both
the
result
and
the
words
are
right
here.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
made
this
in
some
ways
harder
than
it
really
is,
and
we
think
it
would
be
unfortunate
if
that
led
to
radically
expanding
the
role
of
the
courts
in
this
error,
but
in
the
final
analysis
we
think
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
and
equally
as
important
what
the
district
court
did
is
exactly
what
they
should
have
done
under
the
steelworkers
trilogy,
given
the
nature
of
the
agreement
here
and
the
nature
of
the
contentions
that
both
sides
have
made.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
yes,
yes.
we
do.
we
do
indeed.
and
it
is
a
wonderful
illustration.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
that's
right,
and
if
we
could
only
agree
on
the
fact
that
the
substance
of
this
dispute
ought
to
move
on
to
arbitration,
there
would
be
great
harmony
here.
what
the
case
does
illustrate
is
that
in
the
labor
area
particularly
when
company
counsel
is
as
able
as
company
counsel
is
here,
a
matter
can
be
stretched
from
1982
to
1986
by
determining
how
many
angels
will
dance
on
the
head
of
the
word
1983.
with
all
those
preliminaries
and
kind
words
for
the
former
solicitor
general,
on
page
9
of
our
brief,
the
red
brief,
we
set
but
article
viii
of
the
contract,
and
article
viii
is
entitled
to
arbitration,
and
it
says
if
the
national
union
and
the
company
fail
to
settle
by
negotiation
any
differences
arising
with
respect
to
tie
interpretation
of
this
contract
or
the
performance
of
an
obligation
hereunder,
such
differences
shall,
provided
that
such
dispute
is
not
excluded
from
arbitration
by
other
provisions
of
this
contract,
and
provided
that
the
grievance
procedures
as
to
such
disputes
have
been
exhausted,
be
referred
upon
written
demand
of
either
party
to
an
impartial
arbitrator
mutually
agreed
to
by
both
parties.
this
is
what
is
called
a
standard
form
broad
arbitration
clause.
exactly
the
kind
that
was
before
the
court
in
the
steelworkers
trilogy.
by
its
term,
any
difference
between
the
parties
is
subject
to
arbitration,
and
there
is
a
proviso
that
there
are
provisions
in
the
contract
which
exclude
disputes
which
would
otherwise
be
subject
to
arbitration.
and
we
note
some
express
exclusions,
none
of
which
the
company
relies
on
here.
rather,
in
its
answer,
and
at
least
until
the
reply
brief
to
this
court,
the
company
put
it
money
on
article
ix
of
the
agreement,
which
we
set
out
at
page
11
of
our
brief
with
different
emphasis
than
in
the
company's
brief,
but
otherwise
word
for
word
as
it
is
in
the
contract,
and
that
provision
in
its
pertinent
parts
says
that
the
union
recognizes
the
right
of
the
company
subject
to
the
limitations
contained
in
the
provisions
of
this
contract
but
otherwise
not
subject
to
the
provisions
of
the
arbitration
clause
to
exercise
the
functions
of
managing
the
business
which
involve,
among
other
things,
the
termination
of
employment.
now,
the
underlying
claim
by
the
union
here
is
that
article
xx
of
the
agreement
which
we
had
set
out
earlier
in
our
brief
and
is
also
set
out
in
the
joint
appendix
which
provides
that
when
lack
of
work
necessitates
layoffs
there
will
be
layoffs
in
a
certain
way
is
a
limitation
on
what
management
can
do
in
managing
a
business.
the
provision
requires
that
there
be
a
lack
of
work
at
a
particular
place
for
management
to
be
able
to
lay
people
off,
and
so
the
union's
grievance
here
is
predicated
on
article
xx,
substantive
provision
which
on
its
face
can
be
read
to
limit
what
management
does,
and
it
is
our
view
that
that
being
so,
article
ix
cannot
possibly
be
read
as
an
express
exclusion
from
the
broad
arbitration
provision
of
article
viii.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
yes.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
i
am
sure
that
we
will
do
this
to
each
other,
but
the
company's
case
has
been
argued
in
different
ways.
the
company's
case
as
stated
in
its
answer
and
elaborated
in
its
briefs
rests
on
article
ix.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
i
couldn't
have
been
astounded
because
i
wasn't
participating
at
that
point.
0
[generallaughter.]
but
it
is
very
difficult
for
us
to
understand
why
the
court
of
appeals
elucidated
its
reasons
in
this
way.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
it
depends...
we
didn't
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
said
that
the
issue
is
arbitrable.
i
do
agree
with
counsel
for
the
company
that
this
camelion-like
word
"arbitrable"
which
is
something
like
what
first
year
law
students
in
civil
procedure
learn
about
the
word
"jurisdiction"
is
part
of
the
problem.
our
claim
is
and
always
has
been
that
under
the
standard
set
out
by
this
court
in
the
steelworkers
trilogy
an
order
to
arbitrate
should
have
issued.
we
say
that
for
two
different
reasons,
one
of
which
rests
on
the
american
manufacturing
part
of
the
steelworkers
trilogy
and
the
other,
and
the
more
directly
relevant
in
my
view,
on
the
warrier
and
gulf
case.
what
we
are
saying
particularly
based
on
warrier
and
gulf
is
that
the
court's
function
when
you
have
a
broad
arbitration
clause
of
this
kind
is
to
determine
whether
there
is
some
clear
exclusion
of
the
union's
grievance
as
the
union
frames
its
grievance
from
arbitration.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
i
wish
that
i
could
be
more
certain
of
what
the
court
of
appeals'
reasoning
was,
because
there
are
portions
of
the
opinion
which
indicate
that
it
went
through...
the
court
of
appeals
went
through
every
correct
element
of
the
analysis,
but
i
agree
with
you
that
the
language
of
the
opinion,
by
talking
about
leaving
arbitrability
to
the
arbitrator
and
so
on
makes
this
a
harder
case
than
a
case
which
arose
25
years
after
warrier
and
gulf
should
be,
and
we
are
not
asking
the
court
in
any
way,
shape,
or
form
to
add
to
that
unfortunate
confusion.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
what
we
are
arguing
is
that
we
want
an
affirmance
on
the
ground
of
the--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--on
any
ground
we
can
get.
0
[generallaughter.]
but
we
are
arguing
that
we
are
entitled
to
an
affirmance
of
the
order.
we
think
we
are
led
to
an
affirmance
on
the
ground
stated
by
the
district
court,
and
we
are
not
at
all
clear
that
the
court
of
appeals
rationale
or
even
its
reading
of
the
district
court's
opinion
is
the
most
sensible
and
straightforward
one.
there
is
a
footnote
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion...
i
think
it
is
footnote
4
in
the
petition,
page
3a
of
the
certiorari
petition.
although
is
there
some
ambiguity
as
to
whether
the
district
court
ordered
arbitration
of
the
dispute
itself
or
arbitration
of
the
arbitrability
issue,
we
think
the
latter
is
the
fair
reading
of
the
order.
i
don't
think
it
is
the
fair
reading
at
all.
i
don't
understand
how
this
happened.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
but--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--yes.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
but
arbitrators
always
have,
and
the
arbitrator
as
we
point
out--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--only
after
a
court--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--that
is
right.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
i
guess
if,
as
is
contrary
to
all
my
experience,
i
was
to
get
exactly
what
i
wanted,
i
would
ask
that
the
following
portion
of
the
court
of
appeals
judgment
be
affirmed.
the
order
of
the
district
court
is
therefore
affirmed.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
and
then
there
is
a
semicolon
which
goes
on
to
say
the
company
is
ordered
to
arbitrate
the
arbitrability
issue.
you
can
read
that
as
adding
something
or
taking
something
away.
i
am
not
quite
clear.
but
the
district
court--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--no.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
yes,
i
agree
with
that
entirely,
chief
justice,
and
we
would
have
a
clearer
body
of
law
exactly
where
it
stood,
i
think,
before
the
court
of
appeals...
the
court
of
appeals
added
these
words.
i
do
want
to
pursue
the
point
that
justice
white
made,
though,
because
it
is
something
that
we
discuss
as
the
final
point
in
our
brief.
it
is
a
fact
that
warrier
and
gulf
creates
a
presumption,
and
it
says
that
the
courts
in
these
kinds
of
complex
cases
where
arbitrability
is
one
side
of
the
coin
and
the
merits
of
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
and
the
parties,
really,
by
the
way
they
have
written
the
agreement,
have
made
questions
of
arbitration
and
questions
of
the
merits
turn
on
many
of
the
same
considerations
are
not
to
be
trapped
into
using
scarce
judicial
resources
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
union's
grievance
at
the
bottom
is
meritorious,
but
rather
the
test
is
whether
or
not
it
can
be
said
with
positive
assurance
that
this
whole
dispute
should
not
he
decided
by
an
arbitrator.
that
is
in
the
final...
the
very
phrasing
of
the
test
indicates
that
is
not
a
final
determination,
and
in
warrier
and
gulf
on
remand
to
the
arbitrator
the
arbitrator
made,
for
want
of
a
better
term,
an
arbitrability
determination.
he
assured
himself
that
not
only
could
it
not
be
said
with
positive
assurance
that
the
matter
was
excluded,
bit
really
that
the
parties
wanted
him
to
answer
the
merits
question,
and
only
then
did
he
go
on
to
decide
the
merits
question.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
that
would
be
the,
to
take
us
back
to
the
cutler
hammer
case
and
where
matters
stood
before
the
steelworker
trilogy,
and
where,
at
least
until
the
reply
brief
in
this
court,
the
company
was
trying
to
take
us
in
this
case,
because
the
company's
ultimate
argument
is,
and
it
has
to
be
given
the
language
of
article
ix
of
the
contract,
has
to
be
that
there
is
no
limitation
contained
in
the
provisions
of
this
contract
on
the
ability
to
make
layoffs.
but
the
union's
claim
is
that
there
is
a
limitation,
and
the
union
says
where
the
limitation
is.
the
union's
claim
is
that
the
limitation
is
in
article
xx,
and
that
claim
may
be
right
and
it
may
be
wrong.
there
are
people
in
the
union,
as
some
of
the
documents
show,
who
are
little
weak-kneed
about
this
grievance,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
it
makes
a
particle
of
sense
in
terms
of
the
national
labor
policy,
in
terms
of
industrial
peace,
or
in
terms
of
judicial
resources
to
have
the
courts
look
into
precisely
the
same
question
in
the
same
depth
as
the
arbitrator
is
going
to
have
to
do,
and
that
is
why
the
warrier
and
gulf
approach
is
the
proper
one,
and
that
brings
me
back
to
where
i
began.
the
complaint
here
is
that
the
company
didn't
get
its
day
in
court.
that
depends
what
the
legal
standard
is.
the
company
did
get
its
day
in
court
because
on
the
face
of
this
contract,
and
there
is
only
one
other
point
i
want
to
cover,
and
with
regard
to
this
early
new
york
court
of
appeals
case--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--oh,
i
apologize.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
i
believe
that
he
must
under
this
court's
decisions
and
in
light
of
section
203(b)
which
makes
arbitration
the
preferred
means
of
settling
this
dispute
had
the
arbitrator
decide
it.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
and
the
terms
of
the
contract.
have
the
arbitrator
decide
it.
that
is
what
the
arbitrators
are
for.
unions
are
not
perfect
in
determining
what
is
a
good
grievance
and
a
bad
grievance.
the
whole
theory
of
the
system,
as
the
court
explained,
is
to
have
these
matters
determined
by
the
arbitrator,
whether
or
not
the
union
has
a
meritorious
claim,
as
long
as,
as
in
this
case,
there
is
a
standard
broad
arbitration
clause,
and
the
company
cannot
demonstrate,
as
they
are
required
to
do
by
the
language
of
this
contract,
that
there
is
any
exclusion
of
this
kind
of
article
xx
claim
from
the
provisions
of
the
arbitration
clause.
now,
the
company
would
read
a
case
called
in
re
western
electric
company,
which
is
a
1951
and
'52
case
in
the
new
york
courts
as
precluding
the
arbitration
of
the
grievance
here.
first,
let
me
say
that
the
only
opinion
in
in
re
western
electric
company
is
a
four-paragraph,
very
short
paragraph
opinion
by
the
trial
judge.
both
the
appellate
division
in
new
york
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
new
york
issued
orders
without
decisions,
and
what
is
printed
in
the
joint
appendix
is
reporters'
notes
of
the
arguments
of
the
parties
rather
than
any
decision
of
an
appellate
court.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
i
would
say
that
at
the
very
least
you
would
be
clarifying,
and
i
think
in
all
honesty
you
would
be
modifying.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
yes.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
right.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
yes,
i
believe
that--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--justice
white,
we
have
no...
we
are
not
getting
a
thing
more
than
we
had
before
in
terms
of
what
arbitrators...
arbitrators
do.
if
the
court
of
appeals
was
ordering
the
arbitrator
to
do
something
that
arbitrators
did
not
do,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
we
would
have
a
problem
along
the
lines
you--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--but
that
is
why--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--no,
but
that--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--no,
but
that
is
why
i
was
doing
more
than...
i
hope
i
was
doing
more
than
being
unresponsive
or
playing
games
and
try
and
answer
your
question.
as
we
elaborate
in
the
brief,
we
are
not
quite
certain
what
the
court
of
appeals
meant
when
it
said
that
the
arbitrator
is
to
decide
arbitrability.
we
do
know
this
much.
what
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
done
is
go
through
the
analysis
it
did
go
through--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--right,
and
say
the
grievance
is
ordered
arbitrated.
we
don't
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
any
harm.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
i
believe
that--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--i
didn't
get
a
vote
on
the
certiorari.

mr.

why
i
am
in
a
quandary
on
how
to
answer
justice
white's--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--is
what
the
district
judge
said.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
then
the
court
of
appeals
comes
along
and
says--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--no,
but
first
it
said
two
things.
it
says
the
order
of
the
district
court
is
therefore
affirmed.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
semicolon.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
the
company
is
ordered
to
arbitrate
the
arbitrability
issue.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
now,
certainly
we
would
have
been
happy
and
perhaps
the
court
would
have
been
happy
and
the
clerk
would
have
been
happier
if...
in
terms
of
managing
the
docket
if
that
material
after
the--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--the
court
in
warrier
and
gulf
said
that
if
the
party
resisting
arbitration
can
make
a...
i
wanted
to
use
the
exact
words...
a
specific
collective
bargaining
agreement
may
exclude
contracting
out
from
the
grievance
procedure
or
a
written
collateral
agreement
may
make
clear
that
contracting
out
was
not
a
matter
for
arbitration,
and
then
i
will
skip
something.
in
the
absence
of
any
express
provision
excluding
a
particular
grievance,
we
think
only
the
most
forceful
evidence
of
the
purpose
to
exclude
can
prevail.
now,
the
court
doesn't
say
what
the
most
forceful
evidence
is,
but
we
would
argue
that
it
doesn't
make
a
scintilla
of
sense
to
have
what
happened
here
happen
in
this
type
of
proceeding,
and
i
do
think
that
the
answer
is
in
an
agreement
of
this
kind
which
says
except
as
excluded
in
the
contract
for
the
parties
to
get
into
10,000
pages--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--yes.
i
really
don't--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--yes.
well,
i
think
it
would
be
formalism
of
a
high
degree
to
say
that
the
only
thing
you
can
look
at
are
the
words
of
the
agreement,
but
the
common
sense
of
the
matter
is
that
what
the
court
seems
to
have
had
in
mind
in
warrier
and
gulf
is
that
it
be
a
clear,
plain
exclusion.
the
kind
of
side
agreement
you
talk
about
is
a
clear,
plain
exclusion.
the
problem
from
the
company's
standpoint
with
this
earlier
arbitration
and
the
subsequent
bargaining
history
is
this.
it
was
a
different
article
of
the
contract.
the
dispute
in
in
re
western
electric
and
the
new
york
courts
pertained
to
article
xxii,
which
had
to
do
with
disciplinary
actions
by
the
company,
and
the
method
of
the
trial
judge
in
new
york
was
to
evaluate
whether
there
was
anything
in
article
xxii
which
the
union
was
relying
on
which
provided
a
basis
for
a
meritorious
grievance.
so,
his
method
is
exact...
and
he
relied
on
cutlet
hammer.
his
method
was
to
make
the
judicial
inquiry,
which
this
court
says
that
under
section
301
one
is
not
to
make,
and
the
subsequent
bargaining
history
had
to
do
with
changes
in
article
xxii.
the
company
those
what
to
put
in
from
that
bargaining
history
in
the
joint
appendix,
and
it
is
wholly
opaque,
so
the
court
below
was
right,
we
think,
in
saying
that
insofar
as
this
evidence
does
anything,
it
goes
to
the
merits
of
the
union's
article
xx
complaint
in
a
proper
post-steelworkers
trilogy
situation.
that
is
a
question
for
the
arbitrator.
we
are
not
going
to
bother
about
it.
and
we
do
not
think
that
it
tips
the
scale.
so
i
do
think
that
when
you
put
aside
the
choice
of
words
and
get
to
the
substance
of
what
the
district
court
did
and
the
court
of
appeals
did,
the
company
made
all
the
arguments
it
had
about
article
ix,
about
the
underlying
new
york
case,
put
in
all
this
material
about
bargaining
history,
and
the
plain
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
after
it
was
done,
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
were
correct,
under
this
court's
test,
unless
it
may
be
said
with
positive
assurance
that
the
arbitration
clause
is
not
susceptible
of
an
interpretation
that
covers
the
asserted
dispute,
the
matter
should
go
to
arbitration.
that
is
where
this
case
is.
it
would
be
a
help
to
the
labor
bar
and
to
the
court
in
the
future
to
clarify
that
the
courts
have
that
limited
function.
on
the
other
hand,
to
do
what
the
petitioners
ask
is
to
invite
the
courts
deeply
into
the
kinds
of
amorphous
opaque
showings
that
the
company
made
here,
and
to
assure
that
these
matters
which
should
go
to
arbitration
instead
turn
into
a
waste
of
judicial
time.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
yes.
yes,
indeed.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
yes.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
yes,
my
colleague
says
that
that
is
correct.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
no.
i
am
advised
that
there
was
no
formal
separate
mandate
on
that
issue.
when
i
said
the
labor
bar,
chief
justice,
i
meant
parties
on
both
sides
of
these
disputes--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--not
just
union
counsel.
