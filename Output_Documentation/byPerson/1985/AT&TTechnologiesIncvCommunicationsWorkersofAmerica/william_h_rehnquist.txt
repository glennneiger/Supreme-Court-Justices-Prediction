mr.
gold,
was
your
case
argued
this
way
before
the
seventh
circuit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
was
your
opponent's
case
argued
the
same
way
before
the
seventh
circuit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
you
know,
if
the
company's
argument
was
presented
in
those
terms
to
the
seventh
circuit,
your
argument
was
presented
in
the
terms
you
have
just
presented
to
us.
i
dare
say
both
of
you
were
astounded
to
get
the
seventh
circuit's
opinion.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
saying
the
agreement...
the
court
should
have
said
this
issue
was
arbitrable
and
the
company
is
saying
the
court
should
have
said
this
issue
is
not
arbitrable?
the
court
of
appeals
doesn't
say
either
one.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
wasn't
what
the
court
of
appeals
said,
and
that
wasn't
its
reasoning
either.
