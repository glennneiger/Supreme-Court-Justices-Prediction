--are
you
asking
us
in
effect
to
overrule
warrier
and

justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
take
it,
mr.
gold,
you
feel
that
there
is
less
here
than
meets
the
eye.
justice
harry

blackmun
mr.
gold,
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
take
it
no
mandate
has
been
issued
by
the
court
of
appeals
here.
i
think
it
has
been
stayed,
according
to
the--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--sometimes
a
mandate
is
a
little
different
from
the
final
words
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion.
and
i
wonder
what
would
have
happened
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
entered
a
judgment
and
mandate,
but
we
don't
know,
do
we?
