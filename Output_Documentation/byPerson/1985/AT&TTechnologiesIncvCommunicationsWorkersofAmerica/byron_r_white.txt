white
which
is
sort
of
the
position
of
your
adversary.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
really
just
arguing
that
you
want
an
affirmance
on
a
different
ground?
justice
byron
r.
white
any
ground
you
can
get.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
if
an
arbitrator
was
to
live
up
to
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment,
he
would
first
have
to
consider
arbitrability.
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
he,
under
the
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
only
after
a
court
has
said
it
is
arbitrable.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
court
never
said
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
be
asking
for
a
different
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
gold,
if
we
bought
your
argument,
we
wouldn't
be
affirming
the
court
of
appeals,
we
would
be
modifying
his
judgment
to
some
extent.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
be
striking
out
that
one--
justice
byron
r.
white
--provision
that
directed
the
arbitrator
to
decide
arbitrability.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
you
didn't
cross-petition.
do
you
think
you
are
entitled
to
make
this
argument
just
as
respondent?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
it
does
change
the
judgment.
you
are
getting
more
than
you
got.
justice
byron
r.
white
on
that
theory
then
you
shouldn't
modify
the
judgment
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
you
went
through
this
a
while
ago.
i
guess
i
didn't--
justice
byron
r.
white
--i
just
wanted
you
to
play
it
over
again.
0
[generallaughter.]
justice
byron
r.
white
that
you
have
just
gone
through.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it
had
gone
through
this
routine
that
you
say
it
should
have,
either
way
it
would
have
come
out,
the
case
probably
wouldn't
be
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
may
i
ask--
--so
why
should
we
sit
to
go
through
this
routine
now?
because
it
is
here,
i
guess.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know.
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
of
appeals
said
the
arbitrator
has
got
to
do
something
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
gold
doesn't
defend
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
at
least
lukewarm.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
reform
its
judgment.
