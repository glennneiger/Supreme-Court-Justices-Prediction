mr.
rex
e.
lee
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
in
our
view
this
is
a
simple
case
that
requires
a
simple
solution.
the
only
reason
the
case
is
here
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
committed
an
error
which
not
even
the
respondents
defend,
and
all
that
this
court
need
do
and
all
that
it
should
do
is
to
reverse
that
error
and
remand
the
case
so
that
the
lower
courts
can
perform
the
task
that
is
properly
theirs.
there
is
one
question
presented.
it
concerns
the
correctness
of
the
seventh
circuit's
holding
that
there
is
an
exception
to
the
foundational
principal
that
before
requiring
arbitration
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
the
court
must
first
determine
whether
the
parties
agreed
to
arbitrate
that
issue.
in
the
court
of
appeals'
view,
the
exception
exists
where
the
judge
in
order
to
decide
whether
there
has
been
a
promise
to
arbitrate,
would
have
to
consider
any
provision
of
the
contract
other
than
the
arbitration
clause.
the
issue
arose
here
because
the
petitioner
laid
off
79
installers
at
its
chicago
based
location.
the
union
claims
that
article
20
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
makes
these
layoffs
arbitrary.
the
company's
answer
is
that
article
20
does
not
change
article
9's
exclusion
of
all
layoff
decisions
from
issues
that
are
to
be
arbitrated,
and
the
company
places
particular
emphasis
on
a
prior
judicial
interpretation
of
this
contract
and
other
bargaining
history.
now,
under
those
circumstances,
were
the
parties
in
disagreement
over
whether
there
had
been
a
promise
to
arbitrate?
what
the
lower
courts
should
have
done
and
what
both
parties
and
all
three
amici
agreed
that
the
lower
courts
should
have
done
was
to
give
the
parties
their
judgment
on
that
issue.
the
issue
is
arbitrability,
arbitrability
is
for
the
courts,
and
these
courts
should
have
decided
it.
had
they
done
so,
then
no
matter
which
way
they
decided
it,
this
would
have
been
in
respondent's
words
a
thoroughly
uneventful
case
involving
nothing
more
than
the
interpretation
of
one
labor
contract
and
eminently
unworthy
of
review
by
this
court.
but
that
is
not
what
happened.
both
the
district
court
and
also
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
sent
the
case
directly
to
the
arbitrator
without
performing
their
threshold
duty
of
deciding
whether
the
party
ever
intended
this
issue
to
be
arbitrated.
the
seventh
circuit's
view,
this
sidestepping
of
what
it
conceded
was
its
normal
duty,
was
required
because
of
the
interaction
of
two
features
of
this
case.
first,
the
parties
have
not
clearly
excluded
the
arbitrability
issue
from
arbitration,
and
second,
in
order
to
determine
arbitrability,
the
court
would
have
to
consider
not
just
the
arbitration
clause,
article
viii,
but
also
two
what
the
court
called
substantive
clauses,
articles
ix
and
xx.
that
decision
is
hopelessly
inconsistent
with
this
court's
holdings
and
opinions
and
also
with
the
policy
of
encouraging
arbitration.
i
would
like
to
examine
just
briefly
each
part
of
the
lower
court's
two-part
test.
the
first
is
that
the
parties
have
not
clearly
excluded
the
arbitrability
issue
from
arbitration.
that
is
just
a
flat
misstatement
of
well
settled
law
concerning
who
decides
arbitrability.
this
court
said
in
warrier
and
gulf
not
only
that
the
court
decides
arbitrability,
but
it
went
further
and
clarified
the
question
of
jurisdiction
of
the
arbitrator
will
not
be
left
to
the
arbitrator
unless,
and
this
is
a
quote,
"the
claimant
bears
the
burden
of
a
clear
demonstration
of
that
purpose.
"
the
court
of
appeals
ruling
in
this
respect
simply
confuses
the
presumption
of
arbitrability
with
the
question
of
who
decides
arbitrability.
warrier
and
gulf
deals
with
both
of
these
issues.
when
the
question
is
whether
it
is
viewed
as
arbitrary,
then
the
scales
are
weighted
in
favor
of
arbitration,
but
when
the
question
is,
who
decides
arbitrability,
they
are
weighted
in
favor
of
the
judge.
but
it
is
the
second
part
of
the
test
that
really
demonstrates
the
mischief
of
the
court
of
appeals'
error.
it
is
disputed
by
no
one
that
one
of
the
main
reasons
over
the
past
quarter-century
since
the
trilogy
arbitration
has
gained
such
widespread
acceptance
in
the
labor
field
and
has
become
so
successful,
is
that
following
this
courts
unequivocal
assurance
in
warrier
and
gulf
that
the
question
of
arbitrability
is
for
the
courts,
employers
have
been
willing
to
use
arbitration
because
they
have
known
that
where
it
is
really
important
for
them
to
exclude
a
management
function,
or
some
other
subject
from
arbitration,
their
agreements
will
be
honored.
they
know
that
the
scales
are
weighted
in
favor
of
arbitrability,
but
they
also
know
that
they
are
judicial
scales,
and
the
presumption
is
not
an
irrebuttable
one.
if
their
case
for
exclusion
is
strong
enough,
then
a
judge
will
keep
the
issue
from
ever
going
to
arbitration.
now,
common
sense
teaches
that
when
the
courts
perform
this
pivotal
task,
they
must
consider
whatever
provisions
of
the
contract
and
whatever
elements
of
bargaining
history
they
can
find
that
shed
any
light
on
the
issue
whether
there
has
been
a
promise
to
arbitrate,
as
this
court
clarified
in
american
manufacturing,
and
as
clarified
even
better
by
justice
brennan's
concurring
opinion
in
warrier
and
gulf
and
american
manufacturing
even
more
than
the
interpretation
of
a
statute.
the
words
in
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
are
not
to
be
interpreted
in
a
vacuum.
they
can
only
he
understood
against
their
background
and
as
parts
of
the
entire
contract,
so
that
properly
interpreted,
there
is
no
tension
between
the
two
basic
principals
of
warrier
and
gulf
that
the
court
decides
arbitrability
and
the
arbitrator
decides
the
merits.
they
are
parts
of
a
single
whole
principle,
and
that
whole
goes
to
the
parties'
freedom
of
contract.
the
respondents
contend
here,
as
they
have
contended
at
every
stage
of
litigation,
that
what
petitioner
is
really
asking
for
is
an
interpretation
of
the
substantive
meaning
of
article
20.
it
is
a
confusing
argument,
but
at
bottom
it
is
simply
not
true.
what
we
want
out
of
this
case
is
a
judicial
ruling
on
whether
the
entire
contract
in
light
of
its
entire
historical
background
excludes
layoffs
from
arbitration.
does
this
involve
interpretation
of
the
contract?
of
course
it
does.
there
is
simply
no
way
that
a
judge
can
decide
whether
the
parties
have
contracted
for
arbitration
without
interpreting
the
contract,
but
the
judge
and
the
arbitrator
interpret
for
quite
different
purposes,
and
they
ask
quite
different
questions,
and
this
brings
me
to
what
i
submit
is
really
the
key
to
this
court's
solution
of
this
case.
it
is
a
careful
distinction
among
three
quite
separate
questions.
the
ultimate
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
company
could
lay
off
the
installers
in
chicago
when
there
was
no
lack
of
work
in
chicago.
that
issue,
if
arbitrable,
is
the
arbitrator's
issue,
and
no
one
has
attempted
to
litigate
that
in
any
court.
there
was
neither
evidence
nor
argument
put
forth
before
either
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
on
that
issue.
a
second
quite
separate
issue
is
whether
the
parties
have
promised
to
arbitrate
this
merits
issue
concerning
layoffs.
that
was
the
question
that
was
presented
to
the
lower
courts.
that
is
the
question
they
should
have
decided,
and
that
is
the
question
that
ought
to
be
remanded
to
them.
now,
a
third,
again
quite
separate
question
is
the
question
presented
to
this
court.
can
a
judge
in
considering
arbitrability
consider
any
provisions
of
the
contract
other
than
the
arbitration
clause?
and
the
key
to
this
case,
i
submit,
is
for
this
court
simply
to
decide
its
question
and
then
remand
the
case
to
the
lower
courts
to
decide
arbitrability.
what
no
one
at
this
bar
is
urging
is
that
this
court
should
simply
agree
with
the
seventh
circuit
that
the
arbitrator
should
decide
arbitrability.
the
respondents
do,
however,
suggest
two
possible
bases
for
affirmance
of
the
seventh
circuit's
holding.
let
me
deal
with
each
of
those
just
very
briefly.
they
suggest
first
that
the
court
of
appeals
really
made
findings
which
would
support
a
holding
of
arbitrability,
and
in
the
alternative
they
suggest
that
the
lower
courts
may
have
been
using
the
word
301
law.
those
contentions
simply
miss
the
point
entirely.
whether
the
word
"arbitrability"
has
one
meaning
or
two
or
four
is
quite
irrelevant.
the
controlling
fact
is
that
we
contend
that
the
parties
have
agreed
that
disputes
over
layoffs
are
not
to
be
decided
by
an
arbitrator,
and
this
one
is
no
different,
and
that
is
what
the
parties
have
contracted.
we
think
we
are
right
on
that
issue.
we
think
the
language
of
the
contract
and
the
bargaining
history
squarely
support
us.
the
union,
on
the
other
hand,
thinks
we
are
wrong,
and
the
union
also
relies
on
bargaining
history.
but
right
or
wrong,
we
are
entitled
to
our
day
in
court
on
that
issue,
and
to
date
we
have
not
had
our
day
in
court
on
that
issue.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
was
wondering
if
that
was
going
to
happen,
justice
stevens.
i
was
betting
on
you
as
the
possibility.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
exactly.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
i
am
really
not,
and
so
long
as
you
carefully
distinguish
between
that
issue
and
what
i
prescribe,
what
i
detailed
as
the
second
issue--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--then
that
really
provides
the
answer
to
the
case.
the
issue
here
is,
the
issue
here
is
whether
the
court
should
have
decided
not
whether
there
are
two
possible
views
as
to
who
is
right
on
the
contract,
but
rather
whether
the
parties
in
negotiating
this
contract
intended
that
that
particular
issue
was
to
be
arbitrated.
let
me
see
if
this
is
more
helpful,
because
i
realize
that
this
is
a
difficult
problem,
and
yet
i
think
at
the
end
of
the
day
it
really
is
not
difficult.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--see
if
this
is
helpful
to
you.
with
respect
to
the
question
of
whether
there
was
authority
to
lay...
whether
the
company
did
or
did
not
have
power
to
lay
off
workers
at
a
chicago
location
where
there
was
no
lack
of
work.
you
would
look
at
certain
provisions
of
the
contract,
and
you
would
be
looking
for
matters
in
the
contract
that
were
related
to
that.
here,
by
contrast,
the
evidence
that
was
put
forth
before
the
seventh
circuit
was
first
of
all
the
language
of
article
ix
which
says
that
management
functions
are
not
to
be
arbitrated,
and
then
there
is
the
question
of
whether
article
xx
overrides
that,
but
even
more
was
the
matter
of
this
new
york
court
of
appeals
judicial
decision
which
said
that
under
this
particular
contract,
or
at
least
the
predecessor
of
it,
all
layoff
decisions,
all
termination
of
employment
decisions
are
non-arbitrary.
following
that,
the
bargaining
history
shows,
and
it
is
set
for
in
the
record,
and
indeed
in
the
joint
appendix
in
this
case,
that
the
parties
went
into
bargaining
of
a
new
contract
within
months
after
that
decision
came
down,
and
the
union
insisted
on,
in
effect,
overruling
that
new
york
court
of
appeals
decision,
and
they
succeeded
partially.
they
identified
three...
excuse
me,
four
separate
types
of
termination
decisions,
and
in
article
xxii
of
the
contract,
article
xxii
of
the
contract
makes
discharges,
dropping
and
relieving,
subject
to
arbitration,
but
not
layoffs.
now,
those
are
the
kinds
of
issues
that
would
be
considered
in
connection
with
whether
it
was
arbitrable.
they
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
issue
whether
there
was
or
was
not
a
right
to
lay
off
when
there
was
not...
very
often
there
is
a
real
temptation
to
confuse
those
two
issues,
and
that
is
why
you
have
a
split
in
the
circuits
on
this
issue.
but
i
think
at
the
end
of
the
day
if
you
ask
yourself
that
kind
of
evidence
is
it
that
is
really
relevant
to
the
ultimate
merits
issue
and
what
kind
of
evidence
and
what
kind
of
arguments
is
it
that
is
relevant
to
whether
the
parties
intended
that
issue
to
be
arbitrated,
they
are
usually
quite
separate.
now,
i
will
say
that
this
court
did
say
in
warrier
and
gulf
that
it
may
be
necessary
on
occasion
in
considering,
in
the
discharge
of
the
judge's
responsibility--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
of
course
not.
i
am
simply
saying
that
warrier
and
gulf
said
that
you
may
have
to
consider
the
merits,
but
what
i
am
saying
is
that
it
will
frequently
be
necessary.
in
short,
the
seventh
circuit
has
committed
an
error.
really,
in
the
final
analysis
i
think
what
the
respondents
are
asking
is
that
this
court
do
the
job
that
should
have
been
done
by
the
seventh
circuit
and
decide
the
issue
of
arbitrability
itself.
we
would
urge
that
this
court
not
do
that.
it
is
not
one
of
the
questions
presented.
it
hasn't
been
briefed,
and
this
court
functions
best
when
it
receives
the
issues
that
come
before
it
after
those
issues
have
gone
through
the
refining
profess
of
lower
court
decisions.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
they
of
course
point
but
first
of
all
that
what
the
seventh
circuit
did
was
a
dangerous
position.
then
they
urge
basically
that
there
are
four
possible
different
meanings
of
the
word
"arbitrability",
and
they
urge
that
we
ought
no
longer
to
use
the
word
"arbitrability"
in
connection
with...
meaning
the
jurisdiction
of
the
arbitrators
which
is
to
be
decided
by
the
courts.
my
response
to
that
is
twofold.
the
first
is,
i
think
it
is
unnecessary,
quite
unnecessary
to
the
decision
in
this
case,
because
regardless
of
whether
that
phrase
has
one
meaning
or
three
or
for,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
we
have
never
had
a
judicial
decision
on
whether
these
parties
intended
this
dispute
to
be
arbitrated
or
not.
and
finally,
i
think
it
would
be
a
bad
idea
and
the
reason
it
would
be
a
bad
idea
is
that
over
the
years
the
word
"arbitrability"
has
become
a
word
of
art.
you
look
through
this
court's
decisions,
every
one
of
them
since
warrier
and
gulf,
and
it
is
used
as
meaning,
the
judgment
that
a
court
makes
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
arbitrator
has
jurisdiction.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
basically
the
substance
of
their
position
is
similar
to
mr.
gold's,
and
that
is
that
you
can
interpret
from
some
of
the
words
that
the
lower
court
used
that
it
perhaps
did
decide
the
arbitrability
issue,
and
my
answer
to
that
is
twofold.
the
first
is,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
way
that
in
any
objective
reading
of
the
seventh
circuit's
opinion
you
can
conclude
that
that
court
did
give
us
the
judicial
judgment
to
which
we
are
entitled.
if
that
court
had
decided
arbitrability,
there
would
have
been
no
reason
to
label
its
holding
an
exception
to
the
general
rule.
if
it
had
decided
arbitrability,
then
it
would
not
have
needed
to
make
the
candid
confession
that
what
it
did
was
inconsistent
with
wiley
and
sons.
if
it
had
decided
arbitrability,
it
would
not
have
needed
to
say
that
the
district
court
properly
eluded
consideration
of
parole
evidence.
and
certainly
if
it
had
decided
arbitrability
it
would
not
have
ordered
that
the
company
is
ordered
to
arbitrate
the
arbitrability
issue.
but
in
any
event,
even
if
i
am
wrong
on
that,
certainly
at
the
very
least
that
question
is
a
serious
one.
the
seventh
circuit's
error
that
everyone
agrees
on
needs
to
be
corrected,
and
the
case
needs
to
be
sent
back
to
the
seventh
circuit,
and
if
it
is
correct
that
the
seventh
circuit
remanded
something
that
i
cannot
believe
their
opinion
did,
then
there
will
be
ample
opportunity
on
that
occasion
for
them
to
say
so.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
exactly
right.
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
we
do,
mr.
chief
justice.
thank
you.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
very
briefly,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
strongest
statement
that
can
be
made
in
favor
of
mr.
gold's
position
before
reforming
or
whatever
it
is
that
he
wants
to
do
with
this
opinion,
is
that
it
is
uncertain
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
and
what
the
court
of
appeals
said.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
or
what
it
would
do
if
it
had
the
case.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
what
we
are
entitled
to,
of
course,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
in
any
event
an
appellate
court
review
of
what
the
district
court
did.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
we
would
have,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
i
disagrees
the
seventh
circuit
disagrees
with
mr.
gold's
reading
of
the
district
court's
opinion.
now,
at
the
very
least
what
you
have
is
eight
pages
worth
of
opinion
that
is
going
to
go
into
the
federal
reporter
and
has
some
very
bad
law
in
it,
and
that
is
the
reason
that
this
court
granted
certiorari.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that's
right,
and
mr.
gold
doesn't
defend
it.
now,
under
those
circumstances,
it
is
obvious--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
and
when
you
get
a
lukewarm
defense,
you
know
that
he
doesn't
really
defend
it.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
under
those
circumstances,
the
seventh
circuit's
opinion
just
has
to
be
reversed,
and
so
it
has
to
go
back.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that's
correct,
the
judgment
has
to
be
reversed,
and
under
those
circumstances
the
seventh
circuit
is
going
to
have
the
opportunity
on
remand
to
say
what
it
really
meant
and
to
write
a
very
fine
order
that
will
do
just
exactly
the
right
thing.
now,
the
second
point
is,
it
simply
is
not
correct
that
the
seventh
circuit
got
to
the
right
place
by
the
wrong
route,
even
if
you
could
ignore
the
harm
that
it
did
along
the
process
of
going
through
the
route.
we
are
entitled,
and
everyone
in
this
courtroom
agrees
that
we
are
entitled
to
a
judicial
judgment,
and
we
have
not
had
it.
the
court
of
appeals
in
clearest
possible
english
language
says
the
district
court
properly
avoided
consideration
of
the
extensive
parole
evidence
regarding
bargaining
history.
in
our
view,
justice
stevens,
the
real
upshot
of
that
court
of
appeals
opinion,
and
particularly
the
bargaining
history
that
came
after
it,
and
i
won't
review
it,
it
is
there
in
the
joint
appendix,
is
tantamount
to
the
very
thing,
the
very
hypothetical
that
you
are
mentioning,
that
this
really
is
that
separate
side
collateral
agreement,
that
this
is
what
we
meant
all
along.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
exactly,
and
there
is
not
one
word,
not
one
word
in
that
bargaining
history
that
pertains
to
whether
the
company
does
or
does
not
have
the
right
to
layoff
when
there
is
no
lack
of
work
in
chicago.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
that.
so
that
maybe
we
are
right.
maybe
we
are
wrong.
but
our
view
as
to
the
significance
of
that
bargaining
history
is
that
it
is
this
collateral
agreement.
it
is
the
separate
letter
that
says
this
is
the
way
we
have
always
understood
it,
and
we
are
entitled
to
our
day
in
court
on
that
issue.
i
started
out
by
saying
it
is
a
simple
case.
it
has
now
been
even
more
simplified.
the
choices
are
either
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
or
rewrite
its
opinion
in
the
event
you
select--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--and
reform
its
judgment,
and
in
the
event
that
you
elect
to
rewrite
its
opinion,
i
have
a
number
of
suggestions
as
to
how
that
could
be
done.
