chief

we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
at&t
technologies,
incorporated,
against
communications
workers
of
america.
mr.
lee,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
lee,
i
take
it
you
do
not
disagree
with
the
academy's
amicus
brief
that
the
decision
of
the
jurisdiction
is
for
the
court,
not
the
arbitrator.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
court
should
not
undertake
to
try
to
give
some
guidance
to
the
arbitrator
on
how
the
merits
should
be
decided.
on
that
you,
i
am
sure,
agree.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
gold.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
concerned,
i
take
it,
only
with
the
result,
not
how
they
got
there.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
any
quarrel
with
the
district
court's
statement
of
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
they
had
affirmed
on
the
district
court's
opinion,
everyone...
perhaps
not
mr.
lee,
but
at
least
we
would
have
a
clearer
set
of
reasons,
wouldn't
we?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
would
you
say,
mr.
gold,
about
a
district
judge
in
the
first
instance
being
confronted
with
a
demand
for
arbitration
under
a
contract
and
the
district
judge
says
this
is
facially,
obviously
frivolous,
nonsense,
and
i
am
not
going
to
order
an
arbitration?
could
he
do
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
before
you
get
to
that,
mr.
gold,
i
am
not
sure
you
really
responded
to
my
question.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
let's
bring
us
up
into
1986,
long
after
the
trilogy.
the
district
judge
looks
at
it
and
says
this
is
utterly
frivolous
nonsense,
and
i
am
not
going
to
bother
anybody.
can
he
do
that,
or
must
be
let
the
arbitrator
decide
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
terms
of
the
contract.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
the
essence
of
your
argument
to
be
that
the
seventh
circuit
was
right
for
perhaps
the
wrong
reasons,
or
not--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--for
all
the
right
reasons.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
gold--
--when
you
say
that
the
labor
bar,
a
help
to
the
labor
bar,
wouldn't
that
be
a
help
to
everybody?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
lee,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the--
--or
what
it
would
do.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
it
were
possible
to
take
an
appeal
directly
from
the
district
court
here,
would
you
have
undertaken
to
bring
the
case
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let's
suppose
the
court
of
appeals,
then,
to
shorten
it,
said
we
adopt
the
opinion
of
the
district
court.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
is
defending
the
result.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
don't
reverse
opinions.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
