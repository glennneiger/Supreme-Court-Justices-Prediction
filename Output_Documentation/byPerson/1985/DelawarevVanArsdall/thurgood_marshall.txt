mr.
fairbanks,
this
is
not
new,
but
it
still
worries
me.
you
say
we
and
our.
who
are
you
talking
about,
the
state
of
delaware?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
does
the
supreme
court
of
delaware...
who
do
they
represent?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
it
speaks
for
the
state
of
delaware.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
speak
for
the
state
of
delaware.
and
we
make
a
decision
as
to
who
is
the
state
of
delaware,
don't
we?
justice
thurgood
marshall
--if
the
delaware
supreme
court
had
said
solely
on
the
basis
of
delaware
law
this
is
error
and
reversal,
you
wouldn't
be
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
assume
you
say
that
if
the
cross
examination
had
shown
that
this
may
was
lying,
that
wouldn't
be
any
good?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
perjury
is
not
important.
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
final
question
is,
do
you
see
any
unfairness
in
letting
one
side
question
the
witness
and
denying
the
other
side
the
exact
same
privilege?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
not
too
unfair.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
question
of
whether
he
was
correct
or
not,
if
he
was
in
error,
how
under
the
sun
can
that
help
the
defendant
other
than
to
let
him
cross
examine?
you
say
that
he
was
injured,
but
that
is
just
not
important.
justice
thurgood
marshall
injured
is
all
i
need.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
need
more.
that
is
all
i
need.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
do
you
tell
that
from
a
cold
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
judge
didn't
know
that
when
this
witness...
did
the
judge
know
when
the
witness
was
on
the
stand
what
the
state
was
going
to
argue
in
its
closing
argument?
certainly
it
didn't
know
that.
