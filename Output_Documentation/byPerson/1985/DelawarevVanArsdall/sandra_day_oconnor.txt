justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
fairbanks,
does
the
state
concede
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
constitution
here,
the
confrontation
clause?
is
that
the
error?
and
then
you
want
us
to
apply
a
harmless
error
rule
to
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
it
a
violation
of
the
confrontation
clause
in
the
state's
view--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--to
restrict
the
cross
examination?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
am
just
trying
to
determine
what
the
state's
position
is,
whether
it
is
a
concession
that
there
was
a
constitutional
error
to
which
the
harmless
error
rule
should
then
be
applied,
or
whether
there
was
no
confrontation
clause
violation
in
the
first
place.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
just
seems
to
me,
mr.
fairbanks,
that
we
have
to
approach
the
analysis
some
way,
and
i
am
wondering
if
it
is
the
state's
position
that
you
focus
on
the
prejudice
in
determining
whether
there
is
a
violation
in
the
first
place
or
whether
you
focus
on
it
after
you
concede
a
violation
to
determine
whether
it
is
harmless.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
where
would
the
federal
jurisdiction
be
if
it
isn't
constitutional
error.
what
business
do
we
have
hearing
it
at
all?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
larkin,
what
is
the
standard
for
determining
whether
there
is
a
confrontation
clause
violation
in
a
setting
such
as
we
have
in
this
case
of
an
isolated
error
of
limiting
cross
examination
of
a
single
witness?
what
is
the
standard?
is
prejudice
a
component
of
the
standard?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
williams--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--i
suppose
that
mr.
van
arsdall
testified
that
mr.
fleetwood
did
not
see
him?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
didn't
mr.
fleetwood
himself
indicate
that
mr.
fleetwood,
that
fleetwood
had
seen
van
arsdall,
but
not
vice
versa?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
at
least
his
testimony
is
consistent
with
that,
that
he
didn't
think
van
arsdall
had
seen
fleetwood.
isn't
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
i
don't
see
how
that
would
be
inconsistent
at
all
with
your
defense.
