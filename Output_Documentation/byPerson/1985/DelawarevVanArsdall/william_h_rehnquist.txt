justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
challenge
the
supreme
court
of
delaware's
conclusion
that
the
restriction
of
cross
examination
here
did
violate
the
sixth
amendment
right,
do
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
are
you
reading
from,
counsel,
by
reference
to
the
petition?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
don't
let
me
interrupt.
i
just--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but,
counsel,
what
if
the
state
called
the
most
pro
forma
sort
of
witness
just
to
identify
documents
or
something
like
that,
that
really
there
was
no
contest
about,
and
the
delaware
trial
court
refused
to
allow
cross
examination
as
to
bias
for
that
witness.
now,
would
the
supreme
court
of
delaware
reverse
under
that
situation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
now
did
the
supreme
court
of
delaware
hold
that
this
witness
was
crucial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
they
say...
do
they
paraphrase
that,
or
do
you
just
say
they
must
have
thought
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
is
there
anywhere
in
the
supreme
court
of
delaware's
opinion
where
they
say
why
the
witness
cross
examined
here
fleetwood
was
crucial
or
was
different
from
epps?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
this
line
of
argument
made
to
the
jury
by
defense
counsel?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
sort
of
criminal
charges?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
try
the
case,
mr.
williams?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
was
a
nine-day
trial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
how
long
did
fleetwood's
testimony
take?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
including
direct
and
cross?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
am
curious
as
to
just
how
many
pages
of
transcript
does
his
actual
testimony
take?
can
you
remember
that?
