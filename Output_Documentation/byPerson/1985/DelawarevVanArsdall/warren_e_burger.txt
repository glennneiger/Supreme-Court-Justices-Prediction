chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
delaware
against
van
arsdall.
mr.
fairbanks,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
fairbanks,
throughout
your
brief
you
have
cited
chapman
against
california,
and
did
not
the
court
hold
in
that
case
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
it
is
a
constitutional
violation
or
some
other
violation
that
the
harmless
error
rule
applies
to
both
categories?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
undoubtedly
courts
would
look
more...
give
a
much
closer
scrutiny
to
a
constitutional
violation,
wouldn't
you
think,
than
they
would
to
some
other
statutory
or
regulation--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
fairbanks,
i
think
what
we
are
all
probing
at
from
these
inquiries
is
that
if
this
case
was
decided
on
a
state
ground,
the
case
has
no
business
here.
if
there
isn't
a
constitutional
basis,
you
shouldn't
be
here.
we
shouldn't
have
granted
your
petition.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
chapman
tells
all
of
us
that
even
if
there
is
a
constitutional
error,
it
might
be,
it
might
be
subject
to
the
harmless
error
rule,
so
what
do
you
lose,
if
anything,
by
conceding
that
there
is
a
constitutional
error
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let's
get
on
with
your
argument
then.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
doesn't
your
case,
mr.
fairbanks,
depend
on
your
convincing
us
that
the
court
misapplied
chapman
and
harrington
and
the
cases
that
have
followed
on
harmless
error,
even
assuming
the
presence
of
the
constitutional
error?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
larkin.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
williams.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
the
issue
here
whether
cross
examination
would
have
produced
any
benefit?
isn't
that
one
of
the
subordinate
issues
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
they
pass
on
that,
or
did
they
by
a
per
se
rule?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
they
not
apply
that
same
approach
to
the
testimony
of
detective
bowers?
the
trial
court
had
limited
the
cross
examination
of
bowers,
and
the
supreme
court
of
delaware
said
that
limitation
was
within
discretion.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
they
don't
have
an
across-the-board
per
se
approach.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
you
reconcile
those
two
concepts?
the
per
se
rule
is
a
blanket
rule,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
do
you
have
anything
further?
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
