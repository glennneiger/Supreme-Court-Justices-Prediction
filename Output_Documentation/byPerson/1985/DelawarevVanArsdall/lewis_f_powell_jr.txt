justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr
williams,
i
would
like
to
understand
exactly
what
your
position
is
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
in
this
case,
at
least,
the
delaware
supreme
court
applied
a
per
se
rule.
i
read
from
page
a7
of
the
opinion
of
the
delaware
supreme
court,
the
first
full
paragraph:
"we
hold
that
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
where
the
defendant
was
subjected
to
a
blanket
prohibition
against
exploring
potential
bias
through
cross
examination,
the
trial
court
committed
a
per
se
error.
"
is
it
your
position
that
the
error
in
this
case
was
a
per
se
error,
not
subject
at
all
to
examination
with
respect
to
whether
prejudice
was
caused?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
are
you
saying
that
just
to
the
law
of
delaware,
or
is
that
the
federal
constitutional
rule?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
the
delaware
case
that
you
rely
on
primarily
relied
in
turn
on
davis
against
alaska,
which
was
a
united
states
constitutional
rule.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
coming
back
to
this
case,
is
it
your
position
that
wholly
without
regard
to
all
of
the
evidence
viewed
in
its
totality,
that
a
per
se
rule
must
be
applied
even
though
it
is
perfectly
clear
to
the
average
person
or
the
average
lawyer
that
there
was
no
prejudice?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
think
if
prejudice...
if
no
prejudice
can
be
shown,
that
there
is
no
per
se
rule?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
let's
assume
you
have
a
violation
to
begin
with.
i
think
all
of
us
make
that
assumption.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
obviously,
the
judge
should
have
permitted
the
cross
examination.
but
you
have
that
violation,
which
is
a
constitutional
violation.
then
is
it
your
position
that
wholly
without
regard
to
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
case,
there
must
be
a
reversal
of
the
conviction?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
we
may
look
at
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
this
case?
