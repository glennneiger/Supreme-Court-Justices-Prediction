mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
question
before
the
court
in
this
case
is
essentially
one
of
classification.
as
the
court's
questions
have
made
clear,
the
question
here
turns
on
prejudice,
and
whether
prejudice
is
an
element
of
the
claim
that
a
defendant
must
make
in
order
to
establish
a
confrontation
clause
violation
or
whether
it
is
part
of
the
harmless
error
analysis.
now,
in
our
brief
we
haven't
focused
on
that
precise
question,
because
the
question
presented
in
the
petition
didn't
seem
to
do
that
and
because
the
allocation
of
the
burden
of
proof
in
this
case
should
not
be
outcome
determinative.
in
hastings
the
court
made
clear
that
most
constitutional
errors
can
be
harmless,
but
hastings
like
chapman,
said
that
there
are
certain
categories
of
errors
that
are
not
susceptible
to
that
type
of
analysis.
the
first
and
most
elementary
category
are
those
errors
that
for
one
reason
or
another
effectively
deprive
the
defendant
of
what
has
come
to
be
known
as
a
trial.
that
follows
directly
from
the
due
process
principle
that
a
defendant
cannot
be
punished
at
all
by
the
state
or
by
the
government
until
he
has
received
a
trial
that
accords
with
basic
fundamental
fairness.
in
a
case
where
the
defendant
may
have
denied
all
opportunity
to
cross
examine
any
of
the
government's
witnesses,
which
was
essentially
what
you
had
in
brookhart
versus
janus,
you
may
have
a
situation
like
that.
in
that
type
of
circumstance,
the
defendant
has
essentially
been
relegated
to
the
position
of
being
a
member
of
the
audience
rather
than
an
actual
participant
at
the
trial.
but
this
case
doesn't
even
closely
approximate
that
type
of
situation.
however
harmful
the
error
may
have
been
in
the
defense
view,
however
essential
it
may
have
been
to
bring
this
evidence
before
the
trier
of
fact,
what
you
essentially
have
here
is
one
item
of
evidence
that
was
not
allowed
to
be
introduced.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
we
think
a
strong
argument
can
be
made
to
support
the
principle
that
prejudice
should
be
a
component,
the
reason
being
is
that
is
consistent
with
the
purpose
the
confrontation
clause
serves
in
the
trial
process,
which
is
to
enhance
the
accuracy
of
the
outcome.
unless
the
error
on
which
the
defendant
bases
his
claim
calls
into
question
the
accuracy
of
the
outcome
of
the
trial,
the
concerns
the
confrontation
clause
has
are
not
necessarily
implicated.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
we
didn't
make--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
there
would
be--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--i
would,
i
think,
be
forced
just
to
say
that...
i
would
take
the
same
position
we
took
in
the
brief.
in
the
brief
we
said
that
it
wasn't
necessary
to
decide
that
question
in
this
case
because
it
wasn't
outcome
determinative.
now,
once
the
category
of
error
is
put
to
one
side,
that
is,
the
category
where
the
defendant
has
been
deprived
of
a
trial
altogether,
the
question
becomes
whether
or
not
the
type
of
error
is
one
in
which
the
court
will
virtually
presume
in
every
case
that
the
defendant
was
prejudiced.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
we
think
it
is
not
a
good
practice,
and
would
certainly
be
error--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--it
would
turn
on
whether
prejudice
is
an
element
of
the
claim.
for
example,
in
a
case
in
which
the
defendant
is
charged
with
robbing
a
federally
insured
bank--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--yes,
that
would
be
our
position,
because,
although
no
one
would
ever
condone
it,
and
i
think
it
is
unlikely
ever
to
happen--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
i
think
the
reason
it
happened
was
not
because
of
any
feeling
on
the
part
of
the
trial
judge
that
he
wanted
to
damage
the
defense.
after
all,
van
arsdall...
excuse
me,
fleetwood
testified
just
to
two
real
matters.
he
testified
first
to
the
events
that
occurred
at
the
party,
and
those
weren't
in
dispute.
he
testified
that
he
saw
the
defendant
in
the
room.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
yes,
and
it
may
be
not
simply
just
to
show
that
van
arsdall
was
in
the
room,
but
also
to
show
that
pregent
was
in
the
room.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
so
even
though
we
agree
that
the
trial
judge
should
not
have
cut
off
the
inquiry
in
this
manner,
since
in
this
type
of
case
there
was
no
prejudice
to
the
defendant,
there
is
no
reason
to
foreclose
that
type
of
inquiry
based
on
the
characterization
that
the
delaware
supreme
court
made.
what
the
delaware
supreme
court
essentially
did
was
say
that
since
there
was
a
strong
case
for
showing
bias,
and
since
there
was
a
complete
denial
of
any
opportunity
to
do
that,
there
is
no
reason
to
go
further
and
decide
whether
the
case
should
be
decided
differently,
whether
the
outcome
was
affected.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
the
delaware
supreme
court
would,
i
am
sure,
probably
follow
the
same
type
of
analysis.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
right,
in
this
case,
because
we
don't
think
the
outcome
was
affected.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
but
here
the
delaware
supreme
court
believed
that...
it
had
to
presume
that
the
defendant
was
prejudiced
in
essence,
and
it
relied
on
davis,
and
we
don't
think
davis
can
be
read
that
way.
davis
painstakingly
pointed
out
the
fact
that
the
defendant
there
had
been
prejudiced
in
a
variety
of
different
ways,
in
fact,
pointed
out
that
the
witness
may
have
even
lied
on
the
stand.
there
is
also
no
reason
to
adopt
the
rule
that
the
delaware
supreme
court
did.
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
a
complete
denial
of
cross
examination
and
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
witness
is
crucial
are
all
elements
in
deciding
whether
or
not
the
outcome
of
the
case
was
affected.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
if
fleetwood
had
completely
recanted
his
testimony
on
the
stand,
it
still
would
have
had
no
effect
on
the
outcome
of
this
case.
the
defense
has
argued
that
they
were
prejudiced.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
no,
perjury
is
important,
but
even
under
the
court's
decisions
dealing
with
the
introduction
of
perjured
testimony,
that
fact
alone
is
insufficient
to
call
for
reversal.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
oh,
it
is
unfair,
but
the
question
is
not
simply
whether
it
is
fair
to
allow
the
procedure
to
go
in
this
fashion.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
if
the
effect
of
the
trial
has
not
been
changed
in
any
substantial
manner,
there
is
no
reason
to
set
the
judgment
aside.
whether
or
not
a
defendant
has
been
prejudiced
by
a
restriction
on
cross
examination
turns
on
a
host
of
factors,
the
importance
of
this
witness
to
the
case,
the
claim
of
bias
and
its
strength,
the
nature
of
the
defense
that
the
defendant
has
raised,
and
a
variety
of
matters
that
will
vary
from
case
to
case.
no
one,
i
think,
either
we
or
the
state,
has
said
that
the
trial
judge
was
correct
in
cutting
off
the
inquiry
in
this
manner,
but
we
and
the
state
have
taken--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--no,
we
say
he
was
injured
in
the
sense
that
he
wasn't
given
the
opportunity
to
cross
examine
him.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
but
he
wasn't
injured--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--we
don't
think
he
was
injured
in
the
sense
that
the
outcome
of
the
trial
was
any
different.
and
as
long
as
the
outcome
of
the
trial
wasn't
affected,
we--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
examination
of
the
record
here
shows
that
the
state
never
presented
the
theory
that
the
respondent
has
now
argued
as
to
why
he
was
prejudiced.
the
state
didn't
argue
in
its
closing
argument,
and
pages
169
and
201
to
202
of
the
joint
appendix
show
this--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
the
judge
had
some
idea,
because
the
opening
argument--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
the
opening
address
of
the
state
pointed
out
that
they
couldn't
explain
why
the
murder
occurred,
and
in
the
closing
argument
of
the
state's
trial
counsel,
the
state
not
only
argued
that
it
couldn't
explain
why
the
murder
occurred,
it
also
said
they
couldn't
explain
why
the
defendant
went
across
the
hall
to
fleetwood's
apartment.
the
state
never
made
the
argument
to
the
jury
that
the
respondents
say
that
the
state
did.
they
didn't
present
that
theory
to
the
jury.
they
argued
the
exact
opposite,
that
they
couldn't
explain
that.
the
record
as
a
whole
also
shows
that
the
real
controversy
in
this
case
is
not
between
fleetwood
and
the
defendant.
it
was
between
dr.
lee,
the
state's
expert
witness,
and
the
defendant.
dr.
lee,
the
forensic
expert,
tied
together
all
the
pieces
of
circumstantial
evidence
in
a
form
that
showed
that
the
defendant
was
the
one
who
had
committed
the
crime.
fleetwood's
testimony
at
the
time
it
came
and
in
the
manner
in
which
it
was
used
by
the
state
was
relatively
trivial.
the
result
in
this
case
was
not
therefore
any
different
and
would
not
have
been
any
different
if
fleetwood
had
been
fully
impeached
on
this
type
of
matter.
the
particulars
that
he
had
testified
to
were,
of
course,
not
in
dispute
either
as
to
the
events
of
the
party
or
as
to
the
defendant's
presence,
so
we
think
in
this
case
since
the
error...
my
time
is
up.
unless
there
are
any
further
questions,
i
have
nothing
further
to
add.
