mr.
john
r.
williams
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
as
a
result
of
the
constitutional
error
here,
robert
van
arsdall
lost
his
right
to
be
acquitted
or
convicted
on
the
basis
of
all
of
the
evidence
which
exposes
the
truth.
bias
is
always
relevant,
and
the
jury
in
this
case
should
have
been
exposed
to
all
the
evidence.
the
defense
is
entitled
to
present
its
theory
to
the
jury.
the
defendant
should
not
be
convicted
merely
on
the
state's
evidence.
davis
versus
alaska,
a
1974
decision
of
this
court,
pointed
out
that
the
confrontation
clause
of
the
sixth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution
requires
a
defendant
to
have
some
opportunity
to
show
bias
on
the
part
of
a
prosecution
witness.
davis
versus
alaska
did
not
require
any
specific
showing
or
prejudice
because
the
defendant
was
denied
the
right
to
effective
cross
examination,
which
would
be
constitutional
error
of
the
first
magnitude,
and
no
amount
of
showing
of
want
of
prejudice
would
cure
it.
mr.
john
r.
williams
well,
i
think
that
is
certainly
the
issue
that
the
state
would
have
presented
to
this
particular
court,
and
we
think
that
that
is
an
important
consideration.
we
think
that
the
delaware
supreme
court
did
determine
that
in
deciding
whether
or
not
there
was
even
a
violation
in
this
case.
mr.
john
r.
williams
well,
i
think
they
passed
on
it
because
at
page
7
of
the
opinion
they
point
out
that
the
argument
that
the
state
is
making
here
today
was
also
asserted
to
the
delaware
supreme
court.
they
point
out
on
the
first
side
of
the
reported
opinion
that
the
error--
mr.
john
r.
williams
--i
am
not
sure
if
it
is
in
the--
mr.
john
r.
williams
--it
is
page
7
of
the
reported
opinion.
the
quotation,
very
minor
quotation
in
the
argument
made
by
the
state
to
the
delaware
supreme
court
was
that
the
error
was
harmless
because
fleetwood's
basic
testimony
was
cumulative
and
unimportant,
and
in
this
case,
in
deciding
whether
or
not
there
was
even
violation,
it
is
our
position
that
the
delaware
supreme
court
as
a
matter
of
course
had
to
determine
that.
the
right
to
confrontation
of
witnesses
against
a
criminal
accused
is
a
fundamental
right.
it
is
essential
to
a
fair
trial.
confrontation
means
more
than
being
able
to
confront
the
witness
physically.
there
are
several
public
policy
reasons
which
support
the
per
se
error
which
is
formulated
by
the
delaware
supreme
court
in
the
van
arsdall
opinion.
first,
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
it
is
a
rule
of
limited
application.
it
applies
to
a
total
in
limime
prohibition
against
biased
cross
examination
of
a
prosecution
witness.
the
harmless
error
standard
is
still
the
general
rule
in
delaware.
the
per
se
reversal
is
the
exception.
mr.
john
r.
williams
no,
justice
rehnquist,
i
do
not
think
they
would
do
that.
they
have
indicated,
if
not
in
the
van
arsdall
opinion,
in
the
prior
1983
decision
in
webber
that
one
of
the
things
that
you
do
look
at,
and
there
are
a
number
of
exceptions
to
this
delaware
per
se
rule,
one
of
the
things
you
look
at
is
cruciality
of
a
witness.
if
the
witness
is
truly
not
crucial,
then
the
sixth
amendment
confrontation
right
may
not
even
be
implicated.
mr.
john
r.
williams
i
think
they
did.
they
didn't
state
that
specifically,
but
i
think
it
is
inherent
in
the
opinion.
mr.
john
r.
williams
well,
they
cite
to
their
own
decision
the
year
before
in
webber,
the
1983
decision,
and
one
of
the
things
that
is
pointed
out
in
the
webber
versus
state
decision
is
one
of
the
exceptions
and
one
of
the
elements
that
you
look
to
is
cruciality
of
a
witness.
we
think
that
the
delaware
rule
certainly
encompasses
that.
it
would
be
nonsensical
to
have
a
rule,
for
example,
that
if
we
were
denied
confrontation
of...
the
first
witness
who
testified
in
this
particular
case
is
probably
a
good
example.
all
alvin
epps
testified
to...
alvin
epps
was
the
estranged
husband
of
the
victim.
all
he
testified
to
was
that
he
dropped
his
wife
off
at
this
apartment
building
in
the
early
morning,
and
he
didn't
see
her
again
that
entire
day.
we
think
had
we
had
bias
evidence
against
alvin
epps,
for
example,
we
knew
that
he
and
mr.
van
arsdall
had
been
engaged
in
altercations,
if
we
had
that
kind
of
strong
bias
evidence
to
present,
but
we
were
again
prohibited,
even
a
total
in
limine
prohibition
as
in
this
case,
we
would
not
be
arguing
that
that
is
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
confrontation
clause.
mr.
john
r.
williams
well,
i
don't
think
they
say
that.
no,
i
think
what
they
do
is
refer
to
their
prior
opinion
in
webber,
and
you
have
go
to
back
and
read
webber
to
see
the
other
exceptions.
there
are
a
number
of
exceptions
to
the
delaware
rule.
if
the
evidence
that
is
being
offered
in
the
bias
cross
examination
is
marginally
relevant,
then
the
delaware
supreme
court
is
not
going
to
apply
its
per
se
error
rule.
they
have
also
said
that
if
the
cross
examination
in
harassing
in
nature,
then
they
will
not
apply
their
per
se
error
rule.
in
fact,
in
this
opinion,
the
van
arsdall
opinion,
i
was
attempting
to
cross
examine
another
prosecution
witness
at
trial,
jay
meinier,
in
fact,
all
i
wished
to
ask
jay
meinier
initially
was
what
her
address
was.
the
objection
was
made
by
the
prosecution
that
i
was
attempting
to
harass
that
witness,
and
that
objection
was
sustained.
i
think
it
points
out
to
the
court
that
the
delaware
supreme
court
does
not
have
a
broad
across-the-board
rule
in
this
case.
they
said
that,
well,
while
you
didn't
get
to
cross
examine
ms.
meinier
concerning
her
address,
we
are
not
going
to
apply
any
per
se
reversal
rule
to
that
particular--
mr.
john
r.
williams
--that
is
certainly
true,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
r.
williams
oh,
definitely
not,
and
i
think
all
you
have
to
do
is
look
at
the
van
arsdall
opinion.
on
appeal
we
raised
three
confrontation
cross
examination
problems,
and
only
on
one
or
as
to
one
witness,
at
least,
fleetwood,
did
the
delaware
supreme
court
feel
that
its
rule
was
in
any
way
offended.
the
delaware
supreme
court,
of
course,
did
not
reach
the
second
area
of
bias
cross
examination
against
robert
fleetwood
that
we
also
wanted
to
pursue,
that
is,
the
blake
homicide.
the
delaware
supreme
court
simply
hasn't
ruled
on
that
issue.
we
think
in
this
case
that
the
delaware
attorney
general
has
advanced
no
reason
that
the
accused
should
not
have
been
permitted
to
show
the
bias
of
a
prosecution
witness
appearing
at
trial
to
testify
against
mr.
van
arsdall,
nor
has
it
been
demonstrated
that
a
defense
showing
of
fleetwood's
bias
or
interest
would
not
have
affected
the
jury's
assessment
of
the
witness's
credibility.
although
the
state
caused
this
problem,
and
then
claimed
it
was
harmless,
it
now
asks
for
a
license
to
do
the
same
thing
in
the
future,
this
is
not
a
mere
technicality.
this
is
not
a
case
where
a
new
trial
was
granted
because
the
word
"larceny",
for
example,
was
misspelled
in
an
indictment.
the
public
would
be
shocked
to
learn
it
is
only
a
technicality
that
an
individual
on
trial
for
murder
can
be
denied
the
opportunity
to
show
his
jury
that
a
prosecution
witness
may
be
lying.
the
delaware
rule
gives
meaningful
guidance
to
trial
judges
in
the
exercise
of
their
judicial
discretion,
and
that
is
what
was
found
in
this
case.
it
was
found
that
the
trial
judge
had
abused
his
discretion.
certainly
judicial
discretion
is
broad.
but
it
is
not
absolute.
judicial
discretion
can
be
interposed
to
limit
even
bias
cross
examination,
but
a
certain
threshold
of
cross
examination
is
constitutionally
required.
a
harmless
error
rule
of
this
factual
circumstance
places
an
impossible
burden
upon
a
trial
judge.
how
is
a
trial
judge
to
determine
during
a
trial
whether
an
adverse
witness
is
crucial
or
important?
in
fact,
in
this
case
fleetwood's
true
importance
to
the
prosecution
really
did
not
become
apparent
until
after
the
prosecution
had
rested
its
case
and
was
pursuing
the
cross
examination
of
the
defendant,
robert
van
arsdall.
mr.
john
r.
williams
that
is
certainly
our
position
in
this
case.
yes.
mr.
john
r.
williams
well,
we
have
argued
that
in
the
alternative.
we
have
initially
asserted
that
this
was
decided,
this
case
was
decided
on
the
basis
of
state
law,
that
delaware
had
a
particular
parochial
problem.
that
is,
this
problem
keeps
occurring,
occurring,
and
reoccurring,
and--
mr.
john
r.
williams
--that
is
certainly
true.
in
fact,
van
arsdall
also
cites
to
davis
versus
alaska,
but
the
important
thing,
i
think,
about
that,
and
the
way
it
should
be
interpreted
as
to
the
federal
question
issue
here
is
that
delaware
says
in
the
van
arsdall
opinion
that
its
decision,
its
rule
is
consistent,
not
identical,
but
consistent
with
davis.
in
fact,
the
delaware
rule
seems
to
have
evolved
from
some
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
decisions,
article
iii--
mr.
john
r.
williams
--no,
i
don't
think
the
delaware
rule
is
that
simplistic.
in
fact,
if
it
was
that
simplistic,
i
don't
think--
mr.
john
r.
williams
--well,
i
think
you
have
to
decide
whether
there
is
a
violation
or
not
before
you
even
implicate
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
john
r.
williams
certainly.
mr.
john
r.
williams
no,
i
don't
think
we
would
say
wholly
without
regard
to
facts
and
circumstances.
mr.
john
r.
williams
i
think
you
have
to,
just
as
the
delaware
supreme
court
did,
because
the
delaware
rule...
it
says
it
is
a
per
se
rule.
it
is
very
clear.
but
it
is
not
a
blanket
rule
of
automatic
reversal.
there
are
exceptions.
and
i
think
the
most
important--
mr.
john
r.
williams
--it
is
certainly
a
blanket
rule,
but
it
is
a
thin
line,
i
guess
is
the
best
way
i
can
characterize
it.
what
the
delaware
supreme
court
was
concerned
with
was
total
in
limine
prohibitions.
that
is
the
first
limitation,
and
that
is
why
this
is
really
a
narrow
case.
we
are
talking
about
a
very
narrow
category
of
violations
here.
and
in
both
the
webber
decision,
which
preceded
this
particular
case,
and
this
case
there
are
a
number
of
exceptions.
i
have
already
mentioned
a
few.
they
have
indicated
as
well,
the
delaware
supreme
court
has,
that
if
the
testimony
is
truly
cumulative,
that
that
would
not
trigger
the
confrontation
protection.
it
has
been
argued
in
this
particular
case
that
the
testimony
of
robert
fleetwood
was
cumulative.
it
may
be
cumulative
in
content,
and
in
that
sense
there
is
some
superficial
resemblance
to
the
harrington
type
of
situation,
but
it
is
the
position
of
mr.
van
arsdall
the
testimony
of
robert
fleetwood
was
certainly
not
cumulative
in
its
probative
effect.
what
was
the
importance
of
robert
fleetwood's
testimony?
all
he
really
said
was
that
he
saw
robert
van
arsdall
at
pregent's
apartment
prior
to
the
epps
homicide.
van
arsdall
also
stated
that
he
was
at
pregent's
apartment
prior
to
the
epps
homicide.
the
difference
is,
van
arsdall
never
admitted
being
seen
at
the
pregent
apartment
prior
to
the
epps
homicide
by
anyone
with
the
exception
of
daniel
pregent
and
the
victim,
doris
epps.
mr.
john
r.
williams
that
was
our
line
of
argument.
yes,
it
was
made
in
both
opening
and
closing.
that
was
our
defense
in
this
case.
our
defense
was
that
the
post-homicide
conduct
of
robert
van
arsdall
was
simply
inconsistent
with
the
actions
of
a
murderer
or
murder
accomplice.
he
went
across
the
hall.
he
had
blood
on
his
clothing.
he
was
carrying
the
bloody
murder
weapon.
he
knocked
on
the
door
of
fleetwood's
apartment,
revealed
his
presence
at
the
homicide
scene
to
three
other
people.
we
submit
that
is
highly
incriminating
and
certainly
not
the
kind
of
conduct
that
someone
who
had
just
committed
a
homicide
would
engage
in.
mr.
john
r.
williams
yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
john
r.
williams
he
testified
that
he
did
not
recall
being
seen
by
anyone
at
the
apartment
with
the
exception
of
pregent.
mr.
john
r.
williams
well,
i
don't
think
fleetwood
could
have
testified
as
to
what
was
in
van
arsdall's
mind.
i
think--
mr.
john
r.
williams
--well,
i
don't
know
if
that's
true
or
not.
mr.
john
r.
williams
well,
i
think
the
inconsistency,
justice
o'connor,
is
the
inference
that
the
prosecutor
made
when
it
was
cross
examining
van
arsdall.
the
very
point
in
question
that
was
asked
of
van
arsdall
by
the
prosecutor
is,
isn't
it
true
the
reason
you
went
across
the
hall
to
fleetwood's
apartment
was
to
kill
fleetwood,
suggesting
that
van
arsdall
went
across
the
hall
carrying
the
murder
weapon
not
to
alert
other
people
to
a
problem
with
which
he
had
no
culpability,
but
to
do
away
with
a
potential
witness
at
the
scene.
he
didn't
admit
that
he
had
been
seen
by
them,
but
the
inference
was
there.
we
think
under
those
kind
of
circumstances
when
the
testimony
of
fleetwood...
the
probative
effect
is
utilized
to
undercut
the
entire
defense,
that
we
certainly
had
a
right
to
attempt
to
discredit
robert
fleetwood,
and
we
had
strong
evidence
of
bias
in
this
case.
we
had
evidence
that
the
prosecutor
was
dealing
with
this
witness.
he
had
dropped
criminal
charges
on
the
eve
of
this
homicide
trial.
he
asked
robert
fleetwood
to
come
over--
mr.
john
r.
williams
--the
charges,
justice
rehnquist,
were
that
he
was
charged
with
being
drunk
on
the
highway.
it
is
an
offense
in
delaware
where
you
can
receive
up
to
30
days'
incarceration
for
a
first
offense,
and
we
think
that
was
certainly
the
first
area
of
bias
cross
examination
we
wanted
to
pursue.
we
think
that
the
other
evidence
which
the
delaware
supreme
court
really
hasn't
ruled
on,
and
certainly
is
of
greater
consequence,
was
the
fact
that
robert
fleetwood
was
a
suspect
to
the
same
police
department
in
another
homicide,
the
blake
case,
and
we
think
that
is
certainly
important
evidence
that
the
jury
should
have
had.
the
jury
had
the
right
to
decide
whether
this
witness
was
or
was
not
lying,
and
that
is
what
we
were
prevented
from
showing.
this
is
not
a
case
where
you
have
the
erroneous
admission
of
harmless
testimony.
what
you
have
here
is
the
improper
exclusion
of
evidence
that
the
defense
wanted
to
present.
we
had
evidence--
mr.
john
r.
williams
--yes,
sir.
mr.
john
r.
williams
no,
it
was
nine
days
for
the
prosecution
to
present
its
case.
mr.
john
r.
williams
i
can't
remember
if
fleetwood
was
on
for
more
than
on
day
or
not.
it
took,
i
would
think,
at
least
two
to
three
hours.
mr.
john
r.
williams
yes.
there
was
a
long
colloquy
where
we
made
our
offer
of
proof
on
the
two
areas
of
bias
cross
examination.
i
think
it
was
interrupted
at
one
point
even
to
sequester
robert
fleetwood
so
that
he
wouldn't
hear
discussions.
there
were
legal
arguments
being
made
to
the
trial
judge.
in
fact,
we
have
cited
a
1979
decision
of
the
delaware
supreme
court
in
winchon.
mr.
john
r.
williams
i
don't
know.
i'd
have
to
refer
to
the
volume.
but
we
think
that
that
misses
the
point.
i
think
what
the
state
of
delaware
is
trying
to
argue
here
is
that
you
can
quantify
all
these
things,
but
at
some
point
quality
is
important,
and
if
you
have
one
question,
one
good
question
on
cross
examination,
why
did
you
go
across
the
hall
to
robert
fleetwood's
apartment,
to
kill
robert
fleetwood,
that
that
may
be
all
it
takes
for
the
prosecution
to
completely
undermine
the
defense
that
was
presented
in
this
case.
we
think
that
is
certainly
what
happened
here.
robert
van
arsdall
was
convicted.
his
co-defendant,
where
virtually
the
same
evidence
was
offered
at
his
trial,
the
same
forensic
expert,
dr.
lee,
testified
against
daniel
pregent
at
pregent's
trial,
and
pregent
was
acquitted
at
a
subsequent
hearing.
we
think
that
there
is
certainly
a
problem
here
that
the
delaware
supreme
court
has
attempted
to
deal
with
this
difficulty
in
its
trial
courts
by
drawing
a
broad
line
that
any
trial
judge
will
be
cognizant
of
in
the
future.
that
is,
they
have
to
allow
some
bias
cross
examination.
as
long
as
they
do
that,
and
then
they
can
properly
exercise
their
sound
judicial
discretion,
then
the
delaware
supreme
court
will
analyze
for
harmlesses.
however,
if
they
do
not
do
that,
have
a
total
in
limine
prohibition,
and
it
does
not
meet
any
of
the
other
recognized
exceptions
to
the
delaware
rule,
then
delaware
will
certainly
apply
a
per
se
error
rule.
the
delaware
rule,
as
i
said,
does
give
meaningful
guidance
to
a
trial
judge.
the
difficulty
here
is
that
the
trial
judge
really
is
not
going
to
know
during
the
course
of
the
trial
if
a
witness
is
then
crucial
or
then
important
or
may
subsequently,
as
the
facts
in
this
particular
case
indicate,
become
important
later
on
because
of
subsequent
developments
in
the
trial.
a
determination
of
witness
credibility
has
to
be
left
to
the
jury.
an
appellate
court
cannot
speculate
what
a
jury
would
do.
a
jury
is
the
sole
judge
of
witness
credibility.
there
is
no
significant
competing
state
interest
here.
at
least
in
the
davis
situation
it
was
an
alaska
state
policy
of
confidentiality
of
juvenile
delinquency
adjudications,
but
there
is
no
such
state
policy
here.
it
has
been
argued
that
you
will
preserve
scarce
trial
resources
if
you
don't
have
a
per
se
rule
but
a
harmless
error
rule.
it
is
the
position
of
mr.
van
arsdall
that
you
preserve
scarce
trial
resources
by
making
it
plain
that
this
type
of
error
will
not
be
tolerated.
fleetwood's
credibility
was
an
important
issue
in
this
case.
fleetwood's
testimony
hurt
the
defendants.
without
fleetwood,
there
was
no
prosecution
explanation
for
why
van
arsdall
went
across
the
hall,
apart
from
van
arsdall's
innocent
explanation
for
his
post-homicide
conduct.
this
is
not
the
erroneous
admission
of
harmless
testimony.
this
is
the
exclusion
of
defense
evidence.
the
evidence
offered
by
fleetwood
undercut
the
defense
in
this
case.
what
fleetwood
testified
to
may
have
been
cumulative
in
content,
but
it
certainly
was
not
cumulative
in
probative
effect.
the
offer
of
proof
made
in
this
case
clearly
establishes
what
evidence
of
bias
or
interest
the
defense
intended
to
present
to
the
jury
had
it
been
permitted
to
do
so.
the
factual
distinction
between
the
erroneous
admission
of
harmless
testimony
and
the
wrongful
exclusion
of
defense
evidence
makes
a
logical
excision
in
this
case
impossible.
that
is,
you
can't
just
take
it
out,
and
the
reason
you
can't
take
it
out
and
speculate
what
the
jury
would
have
done
was
because
the
jury
never
heard
it,
and
that
is
the
distinction
between
this
case
and
the
harrington
line
of
decisions.
this
was
a
circumstantial
evidence
case,
unlike
harrington.
there
was
not
overwhelming
untainted
evidence
here.
in
fact,
by
the
time
of
closing
argument,
the
prosecution
was
still
not
sure
who
had
committed
this
homicide.
it
offered
the
jury
two
alternative
theories.
that
is,
that
van
arsdall
alone
may
have
committed
the
murder
or
that
somehow
van
arsdall
may
have
been
an
accomplice
to
daniel
pregent.
as
i
pointed
out,
by
the
subsequent
trial,
daniel
pregent
was
acquitted.
we
agree
that
a
confessing
defendant,
as
in
schaebel
versus
florida,
has
little
reason
to
complain.
and
that
is
simply
because
the
sixth
amendment
really
isn't
implicated
in
that
type
of
situation,
but
here
fleetwood's
testimony
was
used
to
the
detriment
of
van
arsdall.
among
the
essentials
of
a
fair
trial
is
that
each
side
has
an
opportunity
to
present
its
evidence
to
the
jury.
when
a
conviction
is
based
only
on
the
prosecution's
evidence,
justice
has
been
denied.
if
there
are
no
additional
questions,
we
submit
the
case
to
the
court.
