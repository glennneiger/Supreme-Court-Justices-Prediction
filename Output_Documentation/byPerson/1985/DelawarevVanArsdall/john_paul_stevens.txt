justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
fairbanks,
could
i
interrupt,
because
i
am
still
a
little
puzzled.
i
don't
mean
to
repeat
what
justice
o'connor
asked
you,
but
do
you
concede...
or
what
is
your
position
on
whether
there
can
be
a
violation
of
the
confrontation
clause
that
has
no
prejudice
to
the
accused
at
all?
in
other
words,
do
you
think
prejudice
to
the
accused
is
an
element
of
the
violation
of
the
confrontation
clause,
or
only
an
element
of
the
harmless
error
inquiry?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
take
effective
assistance
of
counsel
for
a
minute.
if
you
say
that
prejudice
is
an
element
of
a
showing
of
the
violation,
then
you
couldn't
possibly
have
a
harmless...
by
hypothesis,
if
you
have
got
the
violation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
i
am
asking
you,
is
there
a
prejudiced
component
in
the
confrontation
violation
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
the
delaware
supreme
court's
analysis
really
is
kind
of
in
two
steps.
they
first
talk
about
the
confrontation
clause,
and
they
talk
both
about
state
and
federal.
then
they
say
we
have
got
enough
prejudice
here
so
we
have
a
per
se
rule
once
we've
got
a
violation.
if
you
need
prejudice
to
get
the
confrontation
clause,
i
don't
know
how
you
could
ever
call
it
harmless.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that,
but
i
am
just
trying
to
figure
out
what
you
are
saying,
what
issue
that
is
directed
to.
is
it
directed
to
the
constitutional
violation,
or
even
after
a
constitutional
violation
is
conceded,
it
is
directed
to
the
harmless
error
inquiry.
i
just
don't
know
what
your
position
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
fairbanks,
are
you
taking
the
position
that
the
state
puts
on
a
witness
and
the
defendant
says,
i
want
to
impeach
this
witness,
and
the
judge
says,
oh,
that
witness
isn't
important,
i
won't
let
you,
that
he
can
do
that
and
never...
not
commit
reversible
error?
just
say,
i
don't
think
that
is
a
very
important
witness?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
he
says,
this
is
the
last
witness,
this
is
our
last
witness,
and
the
judge
says,
well,
he
is
not
important
at
all,
you
cannot
impeach
him.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
is
it
different
for
a
trial
judge
than
for
the
appellate
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
concede
there
was
error,
and
then
my
next
question
is,
what
is
the
source
of
the
error?
why
is
it
error?
what
rule
of
law
did
he
violate,
the
judge?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
source
of
the
rule
of
law
that
told
him
he
shouldn't
do
that?
is
it
delaware
law
or
some
other
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
do
you
agree
that
the
federal
constitution
obligated
the
judge
to
allow
the
impeachment
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
the
trial
level.
i
am
just
asking
about
the
trial
level.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
this
particular
case
do
you
agree
that
the
trial
judge
violated
the
federal
constitution?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
would
the
judge
have
violated
the
federal
constitution
if
he
had
said
at
the
trial,
i
don't
think
this
is
a
very
important
witness,
i
will
not
allow
any
impeachment
of
this
witness?
would
that
have
violated
the
federal
constitution?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
don't
think
it
is--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
larkin,
may
i
just
take
the
other
side
of
the
coin?
here
the
delaware
rule
is
that
there
must
be
an
opportunity
to
show
bias,
one
form
of
cross
examination.
what
if
instead
of
asking
to
show
bias
he
just
said,
i
want
to
cross
examine
this
witness,
and
the
judge
said,
no,
he
is
not
important,
and
he
denied
the
right
of
cross
examination
entirely.
would
there
be
any
difference
in
the
prejudice
analysis
than
you
have
in
the
delaware
rule,
that
basically
this
is
a
trivial
witness,
he
is
no
worth
the
court's
time
to
hear
you
cross
examine?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course
not.
nobody
is
going
to
argue
it
is
a
good
practice.
what
about
the
constitutional
violation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
take
this
particular
case.
if
one
concluded
that
this
witness
is
unimportant,
which
is
basically
the
state's
argument,
his
cumulative
testimony,
then
i
take
it
your
position
was,
the
trial
judge
could
had
denied
cross
examination
entirely
without
committing
error,
reversible
error.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
might
think
it
is
unlikely
to
deny
a
right
to
show
any
bias
on
a
witness,
too,
but
it
happened
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
the
prosecutor
thought
he
was
important
enough
to
put
him
on
the
witness
stand.
he
at
least
made
that
decision.
so
the
prosecutor
thought
there
was
some
value
to
the
testimony.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
is
similar
to
a
complete
denial
of
cross
examination.
it
would
be
exactly
the
same
analysis.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so
would
you.
