mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
delaware
supreme
court
reversed
robert
van
arsdall's
murder
conviction
because
he
was
not
permitted
to
cross
examine
robert
fleetwood
on
the
issue
of
bias.
the
bias
claim
arose
because
the
state
had
entered
into
a...
dropped
a
traffic
violation
for
mr.
fleetwood.
reversal
was
not
mandated
in
the
delaware
supreme
court's
opinion
because
robert
fleetwood's
testimony
was
important
or
critical...
he
was
a
critical
witness,
or
that
its
impact
in
any
way
affected
the
outcome.
the
delaware
supreme
court
determined
that
the
sixth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution
imposed
a
per
se
reversal
rule
requiring
reversal
in
all
cases
in
which
a
single
witness
was
not
subject
to
complete
bias
cross
examination.
we
do
not
argue
with
the
holding
of
the
delaware
supreme
court
that
bias
cross
examination
in
this
case
should
have
been
permitted.
our
position
is
simply
that
reversal
is
not
mandated
under
the
sixth
amendment
unless
there
is
a
determination
by
the
court
that
the
impact
was
affected
by
the
witness's
testimony,
or
that
if
the
witness
had
been
impeached
the
result
would
have
been
the
same.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
your
honor,
we
concede
that
the
cross
examination
should
have
been
permitted.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
your
honor--
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
--where
you
draw
a
line
between
cross
examination
and
remedy
is
not
clear.
the
state
of
delaware
is
content
with
the
harmless
error
rule
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
justice
o'connor,
we
have
not
and
the
parties
have
not
taken
a
position
on
that
point.
the
parties
have
taken
the
position
that
the
cross-examination
should
have
been
permitted,
and
that
harmless
error
should
be
a
determination
at
some
point,
or
at
least
outcome
determinative
prejudice
should
be
a
determination
at
some
point.
we
do
not
concede
that
the
violation
occurs
without
consideration
of
prejudice.
we
do
not
assert
that
position
in
this
case.
we
simply
assert
that
at
some
point
along
the
line
considerations
of
outcome
determinative
prejudice
is
appropriate.
the
delaware
supreme
court
excluded
such
considerations
from
its
opinion
and
from
its
determination.
it
reversed
solely
and
exclusively
because
there
was
not
the
requisite
quantity
of
cross
examination.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
your
honor,
this
court
has
recognized
that
cross
examination
restriction
cases
raise
confrontation
clause
problems
because
restrictions
on
cross
examination
emasculate
the
right.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
your
honor,
chapman
stands
for
the
proposition
that
at
least
for
federal
constitutional
violations
there
is
not
an
automatic
reversal
rule
mandated
in
all
cases,
and
that
therefore
some
consideration--
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
--that
is
true,
your
honor,
and
we
are
content--
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
--justice
white,
we
believe
that
the
error
was
harmless
wherever
you
placed
the
burden.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
justice
white,
i
think
our
position
is
that
in
the
analysis
the
reversal
is
not
mandated
by
the
constitution
until
you
look
at
outcome
determinative
prejudice.
we
recognize
that
this
court
has
not
drawn
that
line.
this
case
in
our
cert
question--
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
--because
the
delaware
supreme
court
reversed
on
the
basis
that
it
concluded
that
the
constitution
sixth
amendment
right
of
confrontation
compelled
reversal
without
consideration
of
outcome
determinative
prejudice.
we
think
that
is
the
error,
that
at
some
point
along
the
analysis
outcome
determinative
prejudice
must
be
considered.
where
along
the
analysis
is
not
focused
on
in
the
parties'
briefs,
and
it
is
not--
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
--we
do
not
quarrel
with
the
fact
that
the
examination
should
have
been
permitted.
we
do
quarrel
with
the
concept
of
reversal
as
mandated
unless
you
consider
prejudice.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
chief
justice,
i
think
the
delaware
supreme
court
opinion
on
this
point
is
clear.
it
reversed
because
it
believed
the
sixth
amendment
compelled
reversal.
the
delaware
supreme
court
found
federal
constitutional
error
confrontation,
and
reversed
without
looking
at
prejudice.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
your
honor,
for
purposes
of
this
case,
we
don't
quarrel
with
that
fact.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
our
point
is
that
this
case
doesn't
require
a
determination
of
where
you
place
the
line
between
violation
and
prejudice.
it
wasn't
focused
on,
and
that
is
why
the
state
isn't
dealing
with
that.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
the
state
of
delaware,
your
honor.
i
represent
the
state
of
delaware.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
your
honor,
the
supreme
court
of
delaware
is
the
highest
judicial
body
in
the
state.
it
determines
the
law
of
the
state
of
delaware,
and
reviews
convictions
and
reverses
when
it
determines
that
either
federal
constitutional
or
state
constitutional
law
is
violated.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
yes,
your
honor--
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
--i
don't
believe
that
that's
the
crux
of
this
case,
justice
marshall.
the
crux
of
this
case
is
whether
or
not
harmless
error
is
an
appropriate
consideration
at
some
point
in
the
analysis.
we
submit
that
it
is,
that
a
per
se
rule
imposes
an
excessive
penalty,
places
form
over
substance,
and
draws
the
line,
the
delaware
rule
draws
the
line
in
the
wrong
place.
it
places
the
line
on
the
basis
of
quality
of...
excuse
me,
of
quantity
of
cross
examination
permitted,
and
does
not
look
at
the
importance
of
the
witness.
the
delaware
rule
essentially
says
that
if
there
is
no
cross
examination
on
the
issue
of
bias
permitted,
that
reversal
is
required
whether
the
witness
is
important,
whether
the
outcome
would
have
changed
had
cross
examination
gone
forward.
we
think
that
draws
a
line
in
the
wrong
place.
we
ask
this
court
simply
to
push
the
line
differently,
to
draw
the
line
in
a
different
place,
and
to
balance
these
concerns
so
that
the
determination
of
the
importance
of
the
witness
takes
precedence
over
mere
quantity
of
cross
examination.
this
case
was...
took
about
nine
days
to
try,
but
the
state's
case
against
van
arsdall
is
fairly
straightforward.
there
was
a
new
year's
eve
party
in
1981.
it
was
an
impromptu
party
and
it
flowed
between
the
pregent
and
the
fleetwood
apartments.
robert
van
arsdall
was
a
guest.
he
came
to
the
party.
he
ate
dinner.
he
left.
at
about
10:30--
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
--your
honor,
the
guts
of
the
delaware
supreme
court
decision
is
that
effective
cross
examination
was
not
permitted.
we
suggest
that
although
this
case
doesn't
mandate
the
determination,
that
at
some
point,
this
right
should
be
looked
at
in
concert
with
all
the
other
sixth
amendment
rights,
effective
assistance
of
counsel,
speedy
trial,
compulsory
process.
in
no
other
of
those
sixth
amendment
rights--
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
--that
is
true.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
we
concede
that
if
there
is
a
prejudiced
component...
we
simply
haven't
taken
a
position
on
that
point.
i
think
if
pressed
our
position
is
that
it
does
become
a
component,
but
this
case
need
not
rise
or
fall
on
that
premise.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
they
looked
at
prejudice,
we
submit,
at
the
wrong
place.
they
didn't
look
to
prejudice
at
the
outcome.
they
looked
to
whether
or
not
cross
examination
of
fleetwood
could
have
been
successful.
if
cross
examination
of
fleetwood
would
have
been
successful,
they
determined
that
constitutes
prejudice.
we
think
that
is
not
the
prejudice
analysis,
that
at
the
very
minimum
the
prejudice
analysis
comes
in
as
to
whether
or
not
the
outcome
changes.
if
the
outcome
doesn't
change--
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
--this
court
in
davis
versus
alaska
reversed,
and
this
is
the
basis
upon
which
the
delaware
supreme
court
based
its
ruling,
its
interpretation
of
davis
versus
alaska.
we
think
that
its
interpretation
of
davis
versus
alaska
is
excessively
literal,
and
it
doesn't
look
to
what
this
court
actually
did
in
davis
versus
alaska.
davis
versus
alaska
in
our
view
does
not
compel
a
per
se
rule
because
davis
versus
alaska
considered
two
things,
one,
whether
the
cross
examination
of
green
could
have
been
successful,
and
two,
it
determined
that
green
was
a
crucial,
in
effect,
the
key
witness
for
the
prosecution
in
that
case.
it
only
reversed
after
it
determined
both
of
those
two
things.
it
did
not
consider
a
harmless
error
analysis
not
because
the
constitution
forbad
it,
but
simply
it
reflects
the
common
sense
approach
that
if
a
witness
is
key,
if
the
state's
case
wouldn't
be
the
same,
they
couldn't
even
prove
the
case
without
green's
testimony,
a
harmless
error
analysis
is
impossible.
so
that,
yes,
if
davis
versus...
davis
versus
alaska,
we
think,
can
be
read
to
pushing
the
analysis
into
outcome
determinative
prejudice
into
the
violation
for
an
effective
assistance...
excuse
me,
an
effective
cross
examination.
however,
for
this
case,
we
don't
care
where
the
line
is
drawn.
we
simply
want
at
some
point
in
the
analysis
consideration
of
outcome
determinative
prejudice
to
be
considered,
that
the
delaware
supreme
court
in
refusing
to
consider
that,
we
think,
erred.
fleetwood's
testimony
in
this
case
added
very
little.
he
established
but
one
point.
he
established
that
van
arsdall
was
present
in
the
pregent
apartment
some
time
before
midnight.
he
puts
it
between
11:00
and
11:30.
van
arsdall
in
his
two
statements
puts
the
time
that
he
was
present
at
11:30.
pregent
puts
the
time
before
midnight.
the
defense
counsel
said
in
opening
to
the
jury
and
remove
the
question
of
presence
of
van
arsdall
in
the
pregent
apartment,
he
said
he
was
there
prior
to
midnight.
van
arsdall
when
he
took
the
stand
said
that
he
was
there
at
about
11:30.
fleetwood's
testimony
adds
nothing
to
this
case.
it
is
cumulative
and
unimportant.
the
key
time
is
what
happened
when
the
murder
occurred.
the
medical
examiner
put
the
time
of
death
between
midnight
and
1:00
o'clock.
that,
we
think,
is
the
focus.
the
focus
is
not
11:30
in
the
jury's
mind
but
what
happened
when
fleetwood...
excuse
me,
when
van
arsdall
and
pregent
and
epps
were
in
the
apartment.
that
determination
is
made
by
the
medical
examiner's
reconstruction
of
the
crime
scene
and
his
testimony
that
there
were
arterial
spurt
marks
on
van
arsdall's
shirt,
blood
droppings,
and
that
looking
at
it
from
that
point
of
view--
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
--no,
your
honor,
because
the
determination
is
not
the
trial
court's
determination.
the
determination
is
the
appellate
court's
determination--
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
--based
upon
a
reading
of
the
entire
transcript.
the
trial
court
may
not
know
whether
the
witness
turns
out
to
be
an
important
witness.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
i
think
it
depends...
that
that--
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
--it
is
the
same
analysis
that
is
undertaken
in
any
harmless
error
analysis.
the
trial
judge
makes
a
ruling.
harmless
error
permits
the
appellate
court
to
review
that
ruling
and
to
apply
harmless
error
analysis.
it
does
not
compel
the
determination
by
the
trial
court
to
say
it
is
harmless,
don't
permit
cross
examination.
we
don't
think
that
is
where
harmless
error
plays
a
part.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
the
judge
improperly
restricted
cross
examination
on--
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
--the
delaware
supreme
court
determined
that
it
was
federal
constitutional
law,
and
we
think
that
is
the
error,
that
the
federal
constitution
does
not
mandate
reversal
without
consideration
of
harmless
error
at
some
point,
whether
it
is
in
the...
wherever
you
play
it.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
we
agree--
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
--we
agree
that
the
federal
constitution
is
violated
if
no
cross
examination
of
any
witness
is
permitted.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
no,
we
do
not,
because
we
don't
believe
that
the
cross
examination
would
have
been
successful
in
the
first
place.
there
is
no
basis
to
believe
the
jury
would
have
disbelieved
fleetwood.
no
matter
what
cross
examination
is
undertaken,
fleetwood
said
what
van
arsdall
conceded.
there
is
no
reason
for
a
jury
to
disbelief
it.
we
just
don't
think
that
it--
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
--we
think
that
that
is
clearly
a
violation
of
state
law.
the
delaware
supreme
court
determined
that
it
was
a
violation
of
the
federal
constitutional
law--
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
--we
do
not.
we
think
that
the
delaware
supreme
court's
ultimate
rule
was
incorrect,
that
it
placed
the
burden
at
too
high
a
price
for
a
mere
trial
error,
that
it
placed
the
focus
on
the
quantity
of
cross
examination
and
not
on
the
importance
of
the
witness,
and
unless
you
permit
states
to
do
that,
you
permit
the
appellate
courts
to
do
that,
we
think
that
it
is
improper
and
is
not
required
by
the
constitution.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
that's
correct.
but
the
delaware
supreme
court's
opinion
clearly
relies
solely
and
exclusively
on
the
federal
constitution.
it
does
cite
the
state
constitution,
but
it
has
previously
ruled
that
the
state
constitution
is
read
in
concert
with
the
federal
constitution.
that
this
court
said
in
delaware
versus...
was
likely
the
determination
of
the
trial
court...
of
the
state
supreme
court
that
it
really
only
focused
on
the
federal
constitution.
and
under
this
court's
ruling
in
michigan
versus
long,
unless
the
delaware
supreme
court
expressly
articulated
a
basis
for
discrete
state
law,
this
court
has
jurisdiction.
the
delaware
supreme
court
did
not
do
that.
the
delaware
supreme
court--
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
the
delaware
supreme
court
inappropriately
determined
that
chapman
didn't
apply,
even
assuming
a
federal
constitutional
violation,
that
fleetwood's
cross
examination
was
restricted
in
violation
of
the
confrontation
clause.
that
is
our
case.
i
would
like
to
reserve
whatever
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
thank
you,
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
make
three
quick
points.
one,
in
response
to
justice
rehnquist's
question
about
how
much
transcript
is
involved
for
robert
fleetwood's
testimony,
the
entire
direct,
cross,
and
voir
dire
in
which
legal
arguments
were
made
and
the
inquiry
was
made
of
fleetwood
took
51
pages
of
the
transcript.
it
begins
on
page
73
of
the
joint
appendix,
and
it
reflects
that
it
went
from
40
to
91
of
the
trial
transcript.
fleetwood...
the
defense
theory
of
fleetwood's
importance
has
three
problems
with
it.
one,
the
inferences
that
the
defense
seeks
to
draw
are
fairly
attenuated.
fleetwood
said
he
simply
poked
his
head
in
the
door.
he
didn't
talk
to
anybody.
there
is
no
indication
that
he
was
seen.
the
prosecutor
in
closing
didn't
argue
the
point.
that
wasn't
the
basis
of
the
state's
theory
as
to
why
van
arsdall
went
across
the
hall,
and
three
of
the
defendants
didn't
even
notice
that
this
was
a
problem
until
after
he
had
read
the
transcript
at
least
twice,
because
he
only
raises
this
theory
for
the
first
time
in
his
reply
brief.
the
second
point
is,
the
delaware
rule
is
clearly
a
per
se
rule.
in
its
holding
at
page
a7
of
the
petition
the
court
said
in
establishing
a
per
se
error
rule,
it
said
consequently
the
actual
prejudicial
impact
of
such
an
error
is
not
examined,
and
reversal
is
not
mandated.
the
third
point
simply
is
that
this
court
has
recently
recognized
that
confrontation
clause
cases
fall
into
two
broad
categories.
the
first
category
is
the
hearsay,
the
out
of
court
declarations
in
which
there
is
no
cross
examination
of
anybody,
of
any
witness.
in
that
instance,
clearly
harmless
error
is
available.
this
case
falls
in
the
second
category,
the
davis
versus
alaska
category,
in
which
there
is
a
restriction
of
cross
examination.
we
think
it
makes
no
sense
to
impose
a
per
se
rule
only
in
that
line
of
cases.
we
would
ask
the
court
to
reverse
the
conviction.
