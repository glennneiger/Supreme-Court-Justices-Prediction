justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
not
the
theory
of
the
district
court's
decision,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
applied
the
six
year
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kneedler,
can
i
just
ask
you
one
question
about
that,
going
back
to
justice
brennan's
inquiry
at
the
beginning.
if
we
agree
with
the
government
that
this
is
a
quiet
title
action,
then
the
12
year
statute
would
bar
that
claim
as
to
that
and
the
jurisdiction
would
be
proper.
and
if,
on
the
alternative,
we
had
to
deal
with
the
problem
of
whether
it
was
in
affect
a
suit
for
damages
measured
by
what
happened
back
in
'54
or
whenever
the
conveyance
was,
then
would
it
be
proper
in
your
view
to
reject
that
claim
on
the
basis
of
the
six
year
statute
on
the
ground
that
we
have
no
jurisdiction
to
hear
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
all
we
would
have
jurisdiction
to
decide
would
be
the
quiet
title
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
i
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
right,
but
it's
a
pretty
realistic
option
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
i
assume.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
want
to
keep
the
land.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
doesn't
really
affect
the
ultimate
question.
