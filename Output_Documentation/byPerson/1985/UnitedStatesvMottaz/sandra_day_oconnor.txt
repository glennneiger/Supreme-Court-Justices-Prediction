justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
how
much
is
that?
how
much
is
sought?
i
couldn't
find
in
the
record
the
dollars
claimed,
the
amount
in
controversy.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
doesn't
that...
isn't
that
important
to
know
for
purposes
of
knowing
whether
the
district
court
jurisdiction
or
claims
court
jurisdiction
was
appropriate?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
is
the
amount
at
issue
less
than
$10,000?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that
means
district
court
jurisdiction?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
amerman,
would
you
mind
telling
us
what
you
think
the
basis
of
the
suit
is?
is
it
a
quiet
title
action,
in
effect?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
not
an
action
to
establish
title
to
the
land?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
to
win
you
have
to
establish
that
title
is
in
the
name
of
your
client?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
order
to
win
the
suit,
it
would
have
to
be
established
that
your
client
has
title
of
her
share
of
the
allotted
land.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
sounds
a
lot
like
a
quiet
title
action
to
me,
somehow.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
did
refer
to
indian
trust
lands,
of
course.
