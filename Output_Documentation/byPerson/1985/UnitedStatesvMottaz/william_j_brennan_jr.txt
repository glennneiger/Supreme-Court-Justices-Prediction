justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
kneedler,
before
you
get
into
that,
this
is
a
suit
to
recover
money
damages,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
to
the
extent
it
is
a
suit
for
money
damages,
isn't
it
a
tucker
act
suit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask,
if
it
is
a
tucker
act
suit,
doesn't
the
tucker
act
require
this
appeal
to
go
to
the
federal
circuit
rather
than
the
eighth
circuit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
why
shouldn't
we
just
vacate
and
send
it
back
with
instructions
to
send
it
to
the
federal
circuit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
it
were
a
tucker
act
case,
it
should
have
gone
to
the
federal
circuit,
should
it
not?
that's
right.
