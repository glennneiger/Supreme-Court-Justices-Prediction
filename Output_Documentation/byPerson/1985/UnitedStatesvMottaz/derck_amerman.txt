mr.
derck
amerman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
approximately
30
years
ago,
things
seemed
to
get
out
of
hand
a
little
bit
in
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
what
they
did
is
they
decided
to
sell
some
indian
land,
and
they
sent
out
consent
forms
to
thousands
of
indians
around
leech
lake,
minnesota.
there
were
6,111
fractional
heirs
at
that
time.
they
sent
out
the
consent
forms
and
then,
when
they
didn't
get
them
back,
they
transferred
the
land
anyway.
and
the
thousands
of
people
involved
in
this
yet
uncertified
class
action
are
those
people
that
have
fractional
shares
of
80
acre
parcels
where
all
the
consents
were
not
obtained.
they
must
have
known
that
they
needed
the
consent
or
they
wouldn't
have
sent
the
forms
out.
i
don't
think...
i've
talked
to
lawyers
about
this.
usually
the
response
is
it's
outrageous,
you
can't
take
property
away
from
people
unless
you
either
get
their
consent
or
go
through
a
court
hearing,
you
can't
take
my
house
unless
you
do
that.
in
this
case
the
government
was
a
trustee.
in
the
stipulated
facts
they
admit
there
was
a
trust.
they
admit
that
they
did
not
get
all
of
the
express
consent
of
these
people.
to
a
lesser
extent,
the
layman
sometimes
feels
the
same.
but
perhaps
more
importantly
of
all
is
that
the
department
of
the
interior
also
feels
it's
an
outrageous
procedure,
although
that
specific
word
isn't
used.
referring
to
the--
mr.
derck
amerman
--this
case
is
a
345
case.
it
has
to
rise
and
fall
as
a
345
case.
it's
not
a
tucker
act
case
and
it's
not
a
quiet
title
action
case.
jurisdiction,
sovereign
immunity
waiver,
and
consent
to
suit
is
all
under
345,
although
there
is
another
sovereign
immunity
waiver
under
the
general
allotment
act
of
1887.
all
these
things
are
confusing,
at
least
to
me.
but
we
have
definitely
decided?
mr.
derck
amerman
--it's
an
action
that
says
you
never
took
title
a
way
from
us,
there
is
still
an
ongoing
trust;
you
attempted
to
do
it,
you
attempted
to
take
title,
but
you
didn't
do
it
the
right
way;
it
wasn't
legal.
so
there
are
some
pieces
of
paper
up
in
the
county
recorder's
office
is
cass
county,
minnesota,
that
transfer
that
land.
but
those
are
simply
pieces
of
paper.
mr.
derck
amerman
i'm
sorry?
mr.
derck
amerman
that's
correct.
mr.
derck
amerman
well,
there
are
i
think
some
important
distinctions.
the
quiet
title
act
only
applies
to
people
that
rely
on
that
for
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
we're
not
relying
on
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
in
the
quiet
title
act.
we're
relying
on
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
in
the
general
allotment
act
and
under
section
345.
and
as
counsel
mentioned
in
his
presentation,
the
quiet
title
act
has
a
specific
exception
that
says,
this
section
does
not
apply
to
trusts
or
restricted
indian
lands.
and
it's
admitted
that
these
are
trust
allotment
indian
lands.
so
we
don't
think
that
applies.
we
also
don't
think
there
was
any
congressional
intent
to
deprive
thousands
of
people
all
over
the
country
that
had
indian
land
in
trust
of
any
rights
by
passing
the
quiet
title
act.
they
passed
it
to
perhaps
grant
some
rights,
but
not
to
restrict
the
indian
rights.
mr.
derck
amerman
well,
damages
in
our
opinion
is
the
only
workable
solution
to
this
yet
uncertified
class
action.
it's
the
only
way
that
it
can
work.
the
alta,
american
land
title
association,
filed
a
brief
in
this
case.
mr.
derck
amerman
right.
in
other
words,
it's--
mr.
derck
amerman
--pardon
me?
mr.
derck
amerman
because
it's
a...
345
grants
specific
rights
to
indians
under
allotment
land.
section
345
says
that
those
who
claim
to
have
been
unlawfully
denied
or
excluded
from
any
allotment
or
any
parcel
of
land
to
which
they
claim
to
be
lawfully
entitled.
these
are
just,
those
are
only
indians
under
that,
and
they're
only
talking
about
indian
land.
they
also
go
on
to
say
that
"commence
and
prosecute
or
defend
any
action.
"
so
we
think
the
plain
meaning
of
345
grants
everything
that
the
tucker
act
does,
with
none
of
the
disadvantages,
which
are
severe
in
our
case.
so
we
are
not
asking
the
court
to
treat
this
as
a
tucker
act
case.
the
memo
that
i--
mr.
derck
amerman
--i'm
sorry.
pardon
me?
mr.
derck
amerman
i
don't
think
it's
proper
to
do
that.
mr.
derck
amerman
that's
right.
mr.
derck
amerman
yes.
we'll
take
anything
we
can
get,
but
i
don't
think--
mr.
derck
amerman
--i
don't
think
it's
a
tucker
act
case.
mr.
derck
amerman
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
but
we
have
never
treated
it
as,
at
least
not
at
the
appellate
level,
as
a
tucker
act
case.
the
memo
states:
"the
problem
is
that
between
1948
and
1958
bia
officials
approved
numerous
conveyances
of
inherited
allotments
without
the
requisite
consents
of
all
the
indian
landowners.
"
"this
was
done
notwithstanding
the
june
24,
1955,
memorandum
from
the
associate
solicitor
for
indian
affairs
to
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
advising
that
the
interests
of
a
non-consenting
owner
may
not
be
sold
by
the
secretary.
"
"as
a
result,
it
appears
that
numerous
transactions
were
entered
into
without
the
requisite
authority
and
therefore
are
void.
"
citing
ewert
versus
bluejacket.
they
talk
about
bia
misfeasance,
and
internally
in
the
department
they
apparently
know
that
this
was
a
mistake.
so
it's
our
position
that
there
isn't
any
serious
question
here
that
there
was
a
wrong.
the
only
serious
question
is
whether
there's
a
remedy
or
not.
we're
asking
you
not
to
close
the
door
on
these
people
that
had
their
land
taken
without
their
consent
and
without
a
court
hearing.
the
government
historically
has
not...
has
had
a
paternal
attitude
toward
the
indian
and
their
land.
recently
that's
changed,
but
prior
to
the
loring
case,
which
is
kind
of
a
strange
case
in
my
opinion,
but
prior
to
the
loring
case
in
1979
there
was
no
case
that
held
that
there
was
a
statute
of
limitations
on
section
345.
it
wasn't
even
raised.
the
predecessor
statute
of
2401,
which
is
the
sex
year
statute
of
limitations,
was
28
u.s.c.
41(20),
and
under
that
statute
there
was
never
a
statute
of
limitations
defense
raised
for
any
indian
cases.
since
loring
in
1979,
there
have
been
many
cases
where
the
government
has
not
raised
the
statute
of
limitations
issue.
we
don't
know
exactly
why.
perhaps,
given
the
paternal
attitude
toward
indians,
it
became
an
insidious
kind
of
defense
and
went
against
the
historical
treatment
to
try
to
apply
those
kind
of
loopholes.
mr.
derck
amerman
well,
i
don't
think
they--
mr.
derck
amerman
--historically,
they
never
used
it
in
345
cases.
i
understand
your
point.
my
personal
answer
is
that
they
should
try
to
take
care
of
the
indian
problem
and
not
raise
the
statute
of
limitations,
which
would
slam
the
door
on
thousands
of
people.
they
did
this
in
other
areas
of
the
country
also,
so
it
was
a
fairly
big
application.
the
eighth
circuit
used
the
accrual
theory
under
2401
in
ewert
versus
bluejacket,
the
prior
case
of
waskey
versus
hammer,
which
says
that
no
cause
of
action
accrued,
to
avoid
what
we
feel
would
be
a
massive
injustice
if
the
statute
of
limitations
were
applied
to
these
people.
they
said
that
the
underlying
sale
of
land
was
void
and
that
therefore
no
cause
of
action
accrues.
an
equally
good
approach
to
avoid
that
result
is
under
section
345,
because
we
think
that
historical
analysis
and
the
attitude
of
the
united
states
is
not...
the
statute
of
limitations
of
either
the
quiet
title
act
of
'72,
2409,
or
2401
should
not
apply
to
that.
i
just
want
to
say
a
word
on
the
predecessor
here,
4120.
that
statute
that
2401
was
taken
from
was
not
a
strict
statute
of
limitations
statute.
it
was
not
a
general
statute
of
limitations.
it
was
a
jurisdictional
statute
that
contained
within
it
a
statute
of
limitations.
and
in
4120
it
says
that
the
statute
of
limitations
only
applies
to
"under
this
paragraph".
when
that
was
changed
in
1948,
they
moved
24...
excuse
me.
they
moved
4120
to
2401(a),
and
they
moved
the
jurisdictional
provision
to
1346(a).
in
other
words,
all
that
they
did
is
they
combined
the
statute
of
limitations
for
contracts
and
for
torts
under
one
provision.
and
the
revisor,
barron,
in
his
article
"the
judicial
code"
makes
express
the
following
statement.
he
states
that:
"because
of
the
necessity
of
consolidating,
simplifying,
and
clarifying
numerous
component
statutory
enactments,
no
changes
of
law
or
policy
will
be
presumed
from
changes
of
language
in
revision
unless
an
intent
to
make
such
change
is
clearly
expressed.
"
and
there
was
no
express
intent
in
the
revisor's
notes,
and
there
is
no
intent
to
change
that
in
the
legislative
history.
to
go
back
to
the
question,
again,
i
think
that's
why
the
u.s.
never
applied
it.
strictly
going
by
the
words,
the
defense
can
be
raised,
but
the
intent
and
the
purpose
i
think
might
change
that.
there
has
been
some
suggestion
here
that
section
345
only
applies
to
the
issuance
of
original
allotments.
the
eighth,
ninth,
and
tenth
circuit
have
all
held
to
the
contrary
on
that,
and
the
language
of
the
statute
that
i
just
read
talks
about
exclusion
of
commencing
and
prosecuting
or
defending
any
action.
we
think
that
it's
pretty
clear
that
that
statute
covers
ongoing
allotments,
not
just
the
original
issuance
80
years
ago.
we
feel
that
the
quiet
title
act
did
not
repeal
section
345.
what
the
quiet
title
act...
the
position
of
the
government
is
saying
that
in
effect
section
345
was
repealed
by
the
quiet
title
act.
there's
nothing
to
show
that
that
was
intended.
there's
nothing
to
show
that
it
was,
and
there
is
some
authority
to
show
repeals
by
implication
are
not
favored.
there
is
also
some
language
in
28
u.s.c.
2415,
which
really
doesn't
resolve
these
problems
because
it
refers
to
actions
brought
by
the
united
states.
but
here
was
a
lot
of
work
that
went
into
that
act,
and
we
think
you
can
infer
congressional
intent
there
that
they
did
not
mean
to
bar
indian
claims
without
referring
to
it.
the
uncertified
class
action
that
we
have
in
this
case
we
think
is
a
good
remedy,
because
it
doesn't
involve
bona
fide
purchasers
for
value.
it
doesn't
involve
the
innocent
people
that
may
have
purchased
the
land.
in
the
mottaz
case,
the
government
sold
the
land
to
themselves,
and
we
do
not
get
into
that
question
if
it's
a
matter
of
compensation.
the
caippewa
national
forest,
with
these
acres
in
the
middle
of
it,
doesn't
really
lend
itself
to
anything
except
monetary
compensation,
and
that's
pretty
much
what
the
eighth
circuit
said
about
it.
so
we're
proceeding
under
the
election
of
remedies
law
that
i
think
is
nationwide,
although
i
don't
know.
it
certainly
is
in
the
state
of
minnesota.
it
says
in
rescission
cases
you
can
either
take
the
land
back
as
a
remedy
or
go
after
money
damages
if
the
land
back
isn't
appropriate.
and
here
it
seems
to
be
the
only
workable
solution.
in
the
mottaz
case,
individually
she
did
not
receive
payment
and
the
government
has
nothing
to
indicate
to
the
contrary.
we
do
disagree
with
the
eighth
circuit
in
one
point,
and
that
is
that
payment
itself
should
not
be
able
to
transform
non-consent
into
consent.
it
takes
something
more
than
an
indian
getting
a
check
in
the
mail
on
the
reservation,
who
would
probably
cash
it
without
asking
any
questions,
to
turn
that
into
consent
of
his
land.
if
the
statute
of
limitations
closes
the
door
here,
we
feel
it
would
be
a
wrong
without
a
remedy
for
literally
thousands
of
people,
and
we
ask
the
court
not
to
close
the
door
on
these
people.
they're
innocent,
they
didn't
do
anything
wrong,
and
they
don't
deserve
that.
