justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
suggesting,
mr.
amerman,
that
the
government
ought
not
to
raise
a
defense
that
it
might
arguably
say
congress
had
given
it
in
an
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
would
be
a
rather
strange
interpretation
of
the
government's
responsibility
to
litigate
for
the
united
states.
