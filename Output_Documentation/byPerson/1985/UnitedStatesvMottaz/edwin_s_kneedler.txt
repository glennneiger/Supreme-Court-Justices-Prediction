mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
concerns
the
application
of
statutes
of
limitations
to
suits
brought
by
indians
against
the
united
states.
although
there
are
a
number
of
sub-issues
in
the
case,
the
central
question
before
this
court
is
whether
there
is
an
implied
exception
that
renders
inapplicable
to
some
or
all
suits
brought
by
indians
the
statutes
of
limitations
that
govern
suits
against
the
united
states
as
a
general
matter.
two
such
provisions
are
involved
in
this
case.
the
first
is
the
12-year
statute
of
limitations
for
suits
brought
under
the
quiet
title
act.
the
second
is
the
six-year
statute
of
limitations
is
section
2401
of
title
28,
which
applies
to
other
civil
actions--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it's
a
suit
to
recover
money
damages
in
terms
of
the
relief
that's
requested,
but
the
respondent
and
the
court
of
appeals
have
treated
the
request
for
money
damages
as
the
equivalent
of
a
request
for
the
return
of
the
land
itself,
on
the
premise
that
the
land
is
now
situated
within
the
chippewa
national
forest
and
that
respondent
should,
in
the
court
of
appeals'
words,
should,
"as
a
matter
of
policy,
should
be
able
to
force
the
united
states
to
pay
money
rather
than
to
return
the
land.
"
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
if
viewed
as
a
suit
for
money
damages,
it
would
be,
although
the
theory
of
a
tucker
act
suit
is
somewhat
different
than
the
one--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
to
the
extent
it--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--to
the
extent
it
would
be
a
tucker
act
suit,
that
would
be
appropriate.
but
respondent
has
insisted
that
the
underlying
theory
of
the
suit
is
a
contesting
of
the
title
of
the
united
states
to
the
land,
and
she
has
sought
money
only
as
an
election
of
remedies.
and
she
hasn't...
the
way
the
case
has
been
structured,
it
hasn't
been
damages
as
a
remedy
for
something
that
occurred
in
1954.
she's
seeking...
in
which
event
the
money
judgment
would
be
calculated
on
the
basis
of
the
value
of
the
land
or
her
injury
in
'54.
she
has
sought
money
in
the
amount
of
the
current
fair
market
value
of
the
land?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
there
is
not
a
specification
of
that.
i
would
assume
that
it
would
be--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--for
those
purposes,
it
would
be.
we
have
not
suggested
that
the
value
of
respondent's
interest
in
the
land
exceeds
$10,000.
her
own
interest
is
a
one-fifth
interest
in
one
allotment
and
a
one-thirtieth
interest
in
two
other
allotments.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
case
has
been
litigated
on
that
assumption,
that
it
is,
and
we
have
not
to
my
knowledge
suggested
otherwise.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
i
think
it
is.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
would
mean
district
court
jurisdiction,
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
district
court
jurisdiction
and
court
of
appeals
jurisdiction
for
the
quiet
title
acts.
and
it's
our
submission
that
this
case
does
arise
under
the
quiet
title
act.
this
is
because,
as
i
said,
respondent
insists
that
she
has
not
given
up
her
claim
of
title
in
this
case,
and
a
suit
contesting
the
united
states'
title
to
land
arises
in
our
view
only
under
the
quiet
title
act,
which
grants
congress'
consent
to
adjudicate
a
disputed
title
to
real
property
in
which
the
united
states
claims
an
interest
other
than
a
security
interest
or
water
rights.
and
that's
precisely
the
nature
of
respondent's
claim
in
this
suit.
the
united
states
holds
the
land
in
its
own
right--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
theory
of
the
district
court,
the
district
court's
theory
is
somewhat
unclear.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
he
applied
the
six
year
statute
of
limitations,
but
it's
unclear
whether
the
district
court
viewed
the
suit
as
a
tucker
act
suit
or
whether
it
viewed
it
as
arising
under
the
allotment
statute,
section
345
of
title
25,
and
the
jurisdictional
counterpart
in
section
1353
of
title
28.
it's
our
submission
that
the
six
year
statute
of
limitations
would
apply
under
either
view
of
the
suit.
of
course,
a
suit
under
the
allotment
statute
would
go
to
the
eighth
circuit,
unlike
a
tucker
act
appeal.
now,
it's
our
submission
that,
even
if
viewed
as
in
the
nature
of
a
quiet
title
act
suit
under
section
345,
that
section
345
was
never
intended,
for
reasons
we
have
set
forth
at
some
length
in
our
brief,
to
be
a
basis
for
a
quiet
title
act
suit
against
the
united
states
arising
from
the
disposition
of
land
after
it
was
once
allotted
that
section
345,
the
allotment
statute,
applies
only
to
disputes
arising
in
the
initial
process
of
allotment.
so
it's
our
view
that
there
was
no
at
all
for
this
sort
of
suit
and
that,
even
jurisdiction
if
there
was,
that
the
quiet
title
act
passed
in
1972
has
become
the
exclusive
means
for
adjudication
of
disputes
concerning
the
united
states'
title
to
property,
as
this
court
held
just
several
terms
terms
ago
in
block
versus
north
dakota
in
a
suit
brought
by
a
state.
and
lastly,
as
i
mentioned,
that
even
if
this
suit
does
arise
under
the
allotment
statute,
there
is
no
basis
for
exempting
suits
such
as
that
from
the
six
year
statute
of
limitations
in
section
2401
that
the
district
court
applied,
and
that
in
fact
the
court
of
appeals
assumed
was
applicable,
but
announced
a
special
rule
under
which
it
said
that
the
statute
of
limitations
did
not
actually
run
in
this
case.
with
respect
to
the
approach
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
take,
its
particular
disposition
of
the
statute
of
limitations
issue
was
seriously
flawed
in
our
view.
the
court
relied
on
this
court's
1922
decision,
in
ewert
versus
bluejacket,
and
in
that
case
the
court
held
that
a
state
statute
of
limitations
does
not
apply
of
its
own
force
to
a
suit,
to
an
indian
land
title
claim.
and
the
court
did
not
suggest
in
ewert
versus
bluejacket
that
if
the
state
statute
of
limitations
had
applied
that
the
period
under
that
statute
wouldn't
even
have
commenced
because
the
cause
of
action
hadn't
yet
accrued.
and
therefore
ewert
furnishes
no
basis
for
the
special
accrual
rule
that
the
court
of
appeals
announced
in
this
case,
under
which
an
explicit
federal
statute
of
limitations
would
be
rendered
inapplicable
to
a
suit
brought
by
an
indian
whenever
the
suit
is
based
on
a
transaction
that
is
allegedly
void.
and
a
fortiori,
we
submit
that
ewert
doesn't
support
any
such
exception
to
a
statute
of
limitations
in
a
suit
against
the
united
states,
which
is
a
condition
on
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
and
therefore
goes
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
even
to
entertain
the
suit.
and
in
fact,
if
respondent
were
connect
that
the
cause
of
action
hasn't
even
accrued
under
such
a
rule,
then
she
presumably
has
no
right
to
even
bring
the
action
and
the
suit
is
premature.
but
of
course,
that's
not
her
submission
in
this
case.
and
i
should
also
note
that
the
court
of
appeals
approach
to
the
statute
of
limitations
issue
seriously
undermines
the
nature
of
a
statute
of
limitations.
first,
it
would
require,
effectively
require
resolution
of
the
merits
of
the
dispute,
in
other
woods
whether
the
underlying
transaction
was
void,
in
order
to
dispose
of
what
should
he
the
threshold
question
of
whether
the
suit
is
barred
by
the
statute
of
limitations.
and
beyond
that,
it
has
no
connection
to
the
purpose
of
a
statute
of
limitations,
which
is
to
foster
repose,
irrespective
of
the
merits
of
the
underlying
dispute,
and
to
save
the
courts
and
the
defendants
from
having
to
deal
with
cases
in
which
the
evidence
might
not
be
available
because
of
loss
of
memory
or
loss
of
documents.
in
fact,
the
court
of
appeals
acknowledged,
but
didn't
give
weight
in
this
case
to,
the
government's
submission
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
piece
together
the
records
of
transactions
such
as
occurred
here
in
the
1950's,
many
years
after
the
fact.
but
aside
from
the
particular
defect
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decision,
we
thank
that
it
was
also
wrong,
as
i
have
said,
in
not
viewing
this
case
as
arising
under
the
quiet
title
act,
because,
as
this
court
said
several
terms
ago,
the
quiet
title
act
is
the
exclusive
means
for
challenging
the
united
states'
title
to
property.
the
quiet
title
act
contains
its
own
statute
of
limitations,
which
provides
that
any
civil
action
under
that
act
must
be
brought
within
12
years
from
the
date
on
which
the
cause
of
action
accrued.
and
the
quiet
title
act
specifies
when
a
cause
of
action
shall
he
deemed
to
have
accrued,
and
that
is
within
12
years
from
the
date
on
which
the
plaintiff
either
know
or
should
have
known
of
the
claim
of
the
united
states
to
the
land.
in
this
case,
the
district
court
found,
on
the
basis
of
respondent's
deposition,
that
she
clearly
knew
of
the
sale
of
her
land
in
1954,
and
that
the
cause
of
action
accrued,
albeit
for
section
2401
purposes,
as
of
that
date
because
she
was
put
on
notice
of
the
united
states'
interest.
moreover,
in
this
case
respondent
expressed
a
desire
to
bia
in
1967
to
sell
all
of
her
interests
in
allotments
that
she
then
held,
and
bia
furnished
her
with
a
list
of
those
interests,
but
did
not
include
any
indication
that
she
still
owned
an
interest
in
the
three
allotments
at
issue
in
this
case.
and
so
therefore,
when
respondent
filed
this
suit
in
1981
it
was
27
years
after
the
sales,
of
which
the
district
court
said
she
had
knowledge,
and
14
years
after
bia
had
confirmed
that
she
no
longer
held
an
interest
in
the
three
parcels
that
are
at
issue
in
this
case.
so
for
quiet
title
act
purposes,
this
suit
is
clearly
barred
by
the
statute
of
limitations
in
that
act.
furthermore,
as
this
court
held
in
block
versus
north
dakota,
the
statute
of
limitations
applies
to
all
claimants
who
seek
to
take
advantage
of
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
under
that
statute.
in
block,
the
court
applied
that
principle
to
bar
suits
brought
by
states,
and
the
principles
the
court
applied
we
think
apply
equally
here.
first
of
all,
the
language
of
the
statute
of
limitations
refers
to
"any
civil
action"
under
the
quiet
title
act.
there's
no
exception
expressed
for
suits
by
indians,
just
as
there
was
not
for
suits
by
states.
beyond
that,
there's
no
suggestion
in
the
legislative
history
of
an
implied
exception
that
doesn't
appear
on
the
face
of
the
act
for
suits
brought
by
indians,
just
as
there
was
not
for
suits
brought
by
states.
and
in
fact,
as
we
have
set
out
in
our
reply
brief,
there
is
acknowledgment
of
the
possibility
that
suits
would
be
brought
by
indians
against
the
united
states
under
the
act,
and
yet
congress
did
not
fashion
a
special
statute
of
limitations
for
indians.
and
finally,
the
purpose
of
the
statute
of
limitations
articulated
by
the
court
in
block
versus
north
dakota
was
to
serve
the
overriding
rational
purpose
of
preventing
the
national
government
against
stale
claims
and
claims
based
on
evidence
that
might
be
difficult
to
assemble.
and
that
policy
was
perceived
by
the
court
to
be
one
that
requires
uniform
application
in
order
to
be
effective,
and
we
think
that
that
applies
equally
to
claims
brought
by
indians
as
to
others.
now,
respondent
has
suggested
in
this
case
that
the
quiet
title
act
does
not
apply
to
this
suit
because
of
the
provision
in
the
second
sentence
of
subsection
(a)
of
the
quiet
title
act
which
states
that
it
does
not
apply
to
trusts
or
restricted
indian
lands.
respondent
claims
that
these
are
trust
or
restricted
indian
lands
and
therefore
it
falls
outside
the
act.
but
of
course,
that
assertion
begs
the
very
question
that
would
have
to
be
decided
on
the
merits
if
the
case
was
not
barred
by
the
statute
of
limitations.
and
if
respondent
were
correct,
that
would
mean
that
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
that
congress
has
afforded
to
all
other
claimants
would
not
apply
to
indians
who
want
to
bring
claims
against
the
united
states
claiming
that
land
that
the
united
states
claims
title
to
in
fact
should
be
deemed
to
be
held
in
the
interest
of
the
indians.
and
respondent
hasn't
suggested
any
reason
why
congress
would
have
wanted
to
exclude
indians
from
the
benefit
of
that
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
that
was
afforded
to
all
other
claimants.
and
in
fact,
the
text
and
legislative
history
of
the
act
demonstrates
that
congress
did
not
intend
that.
whether
the
exception
under
the
quiet
title
act
applies
for
trust
and
restricted
lands
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
interest
the
united
states
claims
in
the
land,
not
the
interest
that
the
plaintiff
thinks
the
united
states
should
claim.
and
in
this
case
it's
clear
that
the
united
states
holds
the
land
for
the
forest
service,
not
in
a
capacity
as
trustee
for
the
indians.
and
this
view
of
the
application
of
the
exception
is
confirmed
by
the
general
consent
to
suit
in
the
quiet
title
act
itself,
which
grants
consent
to
resolve
disputed
title
questions
to
land
in
which
the
united
states
claims
an
interest.
it's
not
dependent
upon
what
it's
interest
actually
is.
beyond
that,
if
the
united
states
disclaims
an
interest
the
quiet
title
act
does
not
even
apply.
and
the
legislative
history,
beyond
that,
indicates
to
the
same
effect,
that
the
exception
for
indian
lands
was
intended
to
apply
to
situations
where
land
is
"held
in
trust
for
indians",
and
in
this
case
the
united
states
is
not
purporting
to
hold
the
land
in
trust
for
indians.
the
purpose
was
to
prevent
indian
lands
from
being
subject
to
suit
and
challenge
by
third
parties
where
the
united
states
and
the
indians
are
in
agreement
about
the
indians'
interest
in
the
lands.
it
wasn't
to
prevent
resolution
of
disputes
between
the
indians
and
the
united
states.
and
finally,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
reply
brief,
a
provision
of
the
quiet
title
act
in
an
early
draft
of
it
was
deleted
that
would
have
excluded
suits
involving
lands
to
which
indians
or
native
americans
claimed
an
interest
based
on
aboriginal
title.
and
one
of
the
objections
that
the
justice
department
raised
to
that
was
that
it
might
preclude
suits
brought
by
indians
against
the
united
states
where
there
was
an
interest
claimed.
and
the
provision
was
deleted
from
the
bill,
and
we
believe
that
confirms
that
suits
brought
by
indians
are
not
intended
to
be
excluded.
now,
with
respect
to
the
tucker
act,
if
this
suit
does
arise
under
the
tucker
act
there
is,
of
course,
the
jurisdictional
question
mentioned,
but
it
would
be
barred
by
the
statute
of
limitations
under
2401(a)
in
any
event.
that
statute
of
limitations
applies
to
every
civil
action
commenced
against
the
united
states.
there's
only
one
exception
to
that,
and
that's
for
a
person
who
is
under
a
legal
disability;
and
the
existence
of
that
one
exception
indicates
that
congress
has
foreclosed
other
sorts
of
exceptions.
this
same
principle
applies
when
one
considers
the
application
of
section
2401(a)
to
a
suit
under
the
allotment
statute,
section
345,
if
in
fact
that
statute
were
thought
to
apply
here.
congress
has
made
the
statute
applicable
to
all
civil
actions,
has
created
one
exception
for
persons
under
a
legal
disability,
but
has
not
included
any
exception
for
suits
brought
by
indians.
now,
it
has
been
suggested
that
there
is
a
limitation
to
the
statute
of
limitations
for
situations
in
which
property
is
held
in
an
express
trust.
now,
precisely
what
respondent
means
by
that
isn't
clear,
and
it's
not
clear
that
any
such
concept
was
intended
to
be
incorporated
into
the
statute
of
limitations
is
section
2401.
however,
the
court
of
claims,
in
construing
the
parallel
statute
of
limitations
under
section
2501
of
title
28,
has
recognized
that
in
a
situation
where
the
united
states
actually
holds
money
in
a
treasury
account
and
doesn't
dispute
that
it
belongs
to
a
particular
party,
a
particular
indian,
let's
say,
in
a
treasury
account,
and
that
the
money
is
already
existing,
no
statute
of
limitations
applies
to
require
the
claimant
to
request
that
money
or
sue
for
it
within
a
particular
period
of
time.
but
that's
because
the
united
states
in
those
situations
is
not
disputing
that
the
land...
that
the
money
belongs
to
the
indian
and
that
it's
available
whenever
he
requests
it.
however,
if
the
claimant
requested
the
money
and
the
united
states
denied
that
it
belonged
to
the
indian
in
this
case,
then
that
would
be
a
situation
where
there
was
a
repudiation
of
an
express
trust.
and
even
under
the
rule
that
the
respondent
has
advanced
in
this
case,
the
statute
of
limitations
would
begin
to
run.
that
rule
is
reflected
in
the
cases
upon
which
respondent
relies
and
the
other
cases
that
we
set
forth
in
our
reply
brief
discussing
this
express
trust
concept.
so
in
this
case,
even
if
what
this
court
referred
to
as
the
bare
trust
under
section
5
of
the
allotment
act
is
the
equivalent
of
an
express
trust
for
purposes
of
application
of
the
rule
that
repondent
relies
upon,
in
1954
when
the
land
was
sold
out
of
its
trust
status
by
the
united
states
there
couldn't
have
been
a
clearer
repudiation
of
any
trust
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
respondent
with
respect
to
that
land.
and
even
under
the
rule
respondent
suggests,
that
would
trigger
the
running
of
the
statute
of
limitations
at
that
time.
and
whether
the
statute
of
limitations
is
six
years
or
12
years,
that
period
would
have
long
since
expired
by
the
time
this
suit
was
filed
in
1981.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
if
you
view
it
as...
to
the
extent
you
view
it
as
a
tucker
act
suit,
then
to
that
extent
i
think
the
proper
disposition
would
be
to
vacate
the
judgment
below
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--and
the
section
345
question.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
to
the
extent
it
would
be
a
tucker
act
suit,
i
believe
that's
correct.
and
then
a
question
would
arise
whether
the
district
court's
judgment
would
be
final
or
whether,
to
the
extent
it's
a
tucker
act
suit,
the
appeal
could
be
transferred
to
the
federal
circuit.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct,
because
we
believe
that
its
necessary
to
look
at
the
central
claim
of
respondent
and,
although
respondent
claims
damages
in
this
case,
as
i
said,
that's
just
substituting
money
for
land.
and
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
true.
i'm
just
responding
to
the
availability
of
monetary
relief
even
under
the
quiet
title
act.
the
quiet
title
act
does
not
give
the
plaintiff
in
a
quiet
title
act
suit
the
option
of
electing
between
money
or
the
land
itself.
that
sort
of
rule
would
permit
a
private
party
effectively
to
require
the
united
states
to
purchase
land,
whether
or
not
it
wanted
to,
once
the
united
states--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
that's--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--and
the
right
must
not
be
barred.
but
to
the
extent
that
the
availability
of
the
money
judgment
is
at
issue
in
this
case,
it's
not
a
money
judgment
that
the
quiet
title
act
affords
the
plaintiff
a
right
to.
that's
an
option
that
this
court
recognized
in
block
versus
north
dakota
that
is
available
only
to
the
united
states,
to
enable
the
united
states
to
remain
in
possession
of
the
land
that
it
needs
for
operation
of
governmental
programs
even
if
it
loses
the
quiet
title
act
suit.
and
the
presence
of
that
option
for
the
united
states
implies
the
absence
of
an
option
for
the
plaintiff.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
the
united
states
would
want
to
keep
it?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
may
be,
although--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
it
wouldn't
affect
the
statute
of
limitations
or
the
jurisdiction.
but
i
should
point
out
that
in
a
case
involving
an
allotment
and
heirship
status
such
as
this,
where
here
respondent
owns
a
one-fifth
interest
in
one
allotment
and
a
one-thirtieth
interest
in
another,
it's
not
typically
the
case
where
the
individual
owner
of
a
fractional
interest
actually
occupies
the
land
or
even
necessarily
requires
access
to
it.
the
principal
benefit
is
the
income
generated
by
the
allotment.
so
it
would
be
possible
for
the
united
states
to
retain
the
allotment
as
part
of
the
land
it
has
included
within
the
chippewa
national
forest
and
give
to
respondent
her
share
of
the
income.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
at
this
point,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
like
to
respond
to
the
argument
that
this
suit
is
in
fact
a
suit
for
an
allotment.
respondent
concedes
that
in
order
to
win
this
case
she
has
to
establish
that
she
has
title,
equitable
title
to
the
land,
and
in
our
view
that's
just
one
species
of
a
quiet
title
act
suit.
it
doesn't
matter
that
respondent
happens
to
be
basing
the
claim
of
title
on
an
allotment,
just
as
it
doesn't
matter
what
form
any
other
claimant
bases
a
claim
of
title
on.
so
in
our
view
this
clearly
does
arise
under
the
quiet
title
act.
now,
as
we've
explained
in
some
detail
on
our
opening
brief,
section
345
and
its
jurisdictional
counterpart
in
section
1353
of
title
28
was
intended
to
apply
only
to
what
felix
cohen
described
in
a
1942
treatise
as
a
suit
for
an
original
allotment,
and
the
language
of
the
act
is
not
to
the
contrary.
respondent
refers
to
the
language
pertaining
to
prosecuting
or
defending
a
suit,
and
a
suit
for
an
allotment
or
a
suit
concerning
being
excluded
from
an
allotment.
and
as
we
explain
in
our
reply
brief,
that
language
embraces
suits
where
there
is
a
dispute
between
two
indians
claiming
the
entitlement
to
the
same
allotment
in
the
initial
allotment
process.
one
indian
might
already
be
occupying
it
and
the
other
one
is
then
excluded
from
the
parcel
that
he
had
selected
and
is
claiming
should
be
allotted
to
him.
and
in
that
same
situation,
the
indian
who
was
occupying
the
land
would
be
entitled
to
defend
the
suit
under
345
by
the
competing
claimant
for
the
original
allotment.
so
even
those
phrases
don't
suggest
a
broader
reading,
and
in
fact
other
portions
of
the
language
suggest
to
the
contrary.
the
jurisdictional
grant
in
section
345,
after
the
description
of
the
sorts
of
suits
that
can
be
brought,
grants
the
district
courts
jurisdiction
only
over
suits
involving...
"involving
the
right
of
any
person
to
any
allotment.
"
it
is
clear
that
it's
limited
to
suits
seeking
an
allotment
in
that
fashion,
and
1353
is
worded
in
the
same
way.
and
then
finally,
particularly
telling
is
the
nature
of
the
effect
of
the
judgment
that
is
prescribed
in
section
345
itself,
which
says
that
a
judgment
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
shall
have
the
same
effect
as
if
an
allotment
had
been
allowed
and
made
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
in
the
first
instance,
which
obviously
refers
to
the
issuance
of
a
patent
or
other
allowance
of
the
allotment
in
the
first
instance.
the
origins
of
section
345
are
to
the
same
effect,
that
it
arose
in
an
allotment
and
an
appropriation
act
dealing
with
the
initial
allotment
process.
and
as
we
outline
in
our
briefs,
there
were
four
statutes
that
congress
passed
during
the
17
years
after
section
345
was
enacted
in
1894,
all
of
which
confirm
that
it's
limited
to
situations
involving
initial
allotments.
in
fact,
congress
excluded
the
osage
and
the
five
civilized
tribes
from
the
operation
of
345
because
disputes
over
original
allotments
were
otherwise
provided
for.
and
this
court's
decisions
in
first
moon
versus
white
tail
and
most
recently
in
affiliated
ute
also
describe
section
345
in
similar
terms.
in
first
moon
versus
white
tail,
the
court
says
that
the
jurisdictional
counterpart
has
reference
to
suits
for
original
allotments
and
it
does
not
involve
disputes
concerning
valid
and
unquestioned
allotments.
and
here
no
one's
questioning
the
validity
of
the
initial
allotment
to
respondent's
ancestors.
so
all
of
these
points,
to
which
respondent
really
doesn't
answer
at
all,
indicate
that
345
in
its
origins
was
intended
to
apply
to
original
allotments.
the
first
contrary
court
of
appeals
decision
was
an
isolated
one
from
the
ninth
circuit
almost
50
years
later,
and
the
other
decisions
which
respondent
refers
to
were
all
in
the
1970's,
75
years
after
the
statute
was
passed,
giving
it
a
scope
far
beyond
what
was
intended.
even
putting
all
of
that
to
one
side,
we
come
back
to
the
quiet
title
act.
this
court
said
in
block
versus
north
dakota,
in
that
situation
whether
an
officer
suit
could
have
been
brought
before
1972
was
problematic,
but
that
the
quiet
title
act
made
that
remedy
exclusive.
here,
even
assuming
that
a
suit
against...
a
quiet
title
act
suit
against
the
united
states
was
problematic
under
345
prior
to
'72,
the
quiet
title
act
makes
that
remedy
exclusive.
in
fact,
the
second
sentence
of
the
quiet
title
act
explicitly
preserves
certain
other
remedies...
tucker
act
suits,
suits
involving
lands,
and
the
mccarran
amendment.
but
it
does
not
preserve
section
345
suits
or
section
1353
suits
as
a
means
of
challenging
the
united
states'
title
to
land.
so
congress
knew
how
to
preserve
other
remedies
when
it
enacted
the
quiet
title
act
and
didn't
do
so
for
these
allotment
statutes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
referred
to
indian
trust
lands
in
terms
of
exempting
them
where
the
united
states
was
essentially
the
defendant
on
behalf
of
indians.
and
the
fact
that
it
referred
to
indian
lands
i
think
suggests
that
congress
would
have
created
an
exception
for
other
sorts
of
remedies
against
the
united
states
by
indians
if
it
had
wanted
to
do
so.
but
it
did
not,
and
the
reason,
it's
understandable,
because
only
six
months
earlier
in
affiliated
ute
the
court
had
given
the
narrow
construction
to
345
that
we
urge.
section
345
also
does
not
provide
a
damage
remedy
against
the
united
states.
as
we
explain,
the
tucker
act
is
the
exclusive
remedy
for
that.
and
then
finally,
even
if
section
345
does
apply,
the
statute
of
limitations
in
whether
2401
bars
this
suit.
by
its
terms,
section
2401
applies
to
every
civil
action
against
the
united
states.
there's
no
exception
for
suits
by
indians.
and
prior
to
1948,
the
six
year
statute
of
limitations
was
in
the
tucker
act
grant
of
jurisdiction
and
said
suits
under
this
paragraph
are
barred
if
not
brought
within
six
years.
in
'48,
congress
lifted
the
statute
of
limitations
out
and
put
it
is
a
separate
chapter
of
title
28
applicable
to
suits
against
the
united
states
generally,
which
would
encompass
suits
under
1353
and
345,
and
said
not...
and
did
not
limit
it
by
language,
such
as
suits
under
this
paragraph
or
suits
under
the
tucker
act.
it
said
every
civil
action
against
the
united
states.
and
i
would
point
out
that
every
court
of
appeals
that
has
considered
the
question
of
the
scope
of
section
2401
has
rejected
the
argument
that
it
is
limited
to
suits
under
the
tucker
act,
as
its
predecessor
was,
and
the
ninth
circuit
has
applied
it
to
suits
under
345.
and
even
the
eighth
circuit
in
this
case
did
not
suggest
that
section
2401
is
inapplicable
to
suits
under
section
345.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
