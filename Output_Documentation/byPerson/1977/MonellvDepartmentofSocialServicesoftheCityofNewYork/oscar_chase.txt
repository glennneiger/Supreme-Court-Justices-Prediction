mr.
oscar
chase
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
oscar
chase.
i
represent
the
plaintiffs
in
this
action
who
consist
essentially
of
two
groups
of
women.
one
group
was
employed
by
the
city
of
new
york
at
the
times
of
the
events
alleged
in
the
complaint.
the
other
group
was
employed
by
the
board
of
education
of
the
city
of
new
york.
the
two
groups
have
in
common
the
fact
that
they
will
all
compel
to
take
unwanted
leaves
of
absence
from
their
employment
as
a
result
of
a
compulsory
pregnancy
rule
of
the
kind
with
which
the
court
is
familiar
after
cleveland
board
of
education
against
lafleur.
the
principle
relief
sought
was
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief
as
well
as
an
award
of
lost
wages.
after
the
defendants
changed
their
policies,
some
time
after
the
complaint
was
filed,
the
court
below
dismissed
the
declaratory
and
injunctive
request
as
moot
and
then
went
on
to
dismiss
the
remaining
claims
for
back
pay
as
a
wanting
and
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
the
court
held
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
that
the
board
of
education
was
not
a
"person"
within
the
meaning
of
section
1983
and
then
in
the
second
branch
of
the
case,
held
that
municipal
officials
are
not
persons
when
monitory
relief
is
sought
against
them
in
their
official
capacity.
mr.
oscar
chase
that
would
be
the
effect
of
it,
yes.
turning
first
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
board
of
education
is
a
person,
we
must
note
preliminarily
that
the
question
is
a
unitary
one
in
terms
of
remedial
purposes.
mr.
oscar
chase
that
was
not
raised
below
because
that
aspect
of
the
case
was
moot
and
no
appeal
was
taken
from
that.
but
as
to
the
unitary
question
of
the
personhood
of
the
board
of
education,
city
of
kenosha
against
bruno
teaches
that
the
personhood
is
not
determinable
by
reference
to
the
relief
sought.
under
1983,
a
person
is
a
person
and
as
to
the
board's
status
in
that
regard,
we
would
note
that
the
court
is
not
here
writing
on
a
clean
slate,
there
is
a
long
line
of
precedent
dealing
with
school
segregation
cases,
a
line
of
cases
lamented
by
some
i
suppose,
applauded
by
most,
but
agreed
by
all
to
a
workday
fundamental
change
in
the
way
this
country
educates
its
young.
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
the
importance
of
those
cases
on
two
grounds.
one,
the
results
reached
as
to
jurisdiction
in
those
cases
were
reached
through
inadvertence
and
secondly,
the
individuals,
members
of
the
board
were
named
in
those
cases
as
well
as
the
board
members.
these
reasons
we
submit
are
insufficient
for
rejecting
this
established
line.
first
is
to
the
fact
that
they
were
as
we
can
see
it
in
most
of
these
cases
individual
defendants
as
well
as
board
members.
we
would
note
though
that
the
court
has
focused
time
and
again
on
the
board,
the
defendant
board,
the
respondent
board
and
mr.
justice
powell
concurring
in
the
second
milliken
case
last
term,
noted
that
in
the
line
of
precedents
commencing
with
brown,
the
principal
defendant,
i
am
quoting
here
is
usually
the
local
board
of
education
or
school
board.
mr.
oscar
chase
yes
and
for
the
purposes
of
that
case
it
was
relevant,
but
for
the
purpose
of
this
case,
i
think
the
important
thing
is
that
whether
it
be
state
board
or
local
board,
it
is
the
board
that
is
the
defendant,
it
is
the
entity
that
is
doing
the
wrong.
mr.
oscar
chase
oh,
i
do
agree
with
it
your
honor
and
if
we
were
talking
about
one
or
two
cases
or
an
accidental
reference
in
an
occasional
case
to
a
school
board,
i
would
not
be
presenting
this
argument.
but
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
line
of
cases
which
as
i
mentioned
is
fundamental
in
the
jurisprudence
and
in
the
political
history
of
this
country.
its
strange
belief
that
this
court
which
has
imposed
on
itself
in
another
context,
the
duty
of
determining
whether
subject
matter
jurisdiction
exists
in
the
lower
courts,
that
this
court
would
then
fail
to
appreciate
that
problem
in
cases
of
this
magnitude.
of
course
it
is
always
open
to
the
court
to
readdress
a
fundamental
point
of
that
nature.
but
we
would
add
that
congress
has
additionally
acted
in
reliance
on
those
cases
and
has
also
spoken
in
terms
of
local
educational
agencies.
thus
congress
and
we
cite
the
statute
in
our
brief
and
the
amicus
brief
has
allowed
attorney's
fees
to
be
provided
to
prevailing
parties
where
the
defendant
was
a
local
educational
agency
and
the
leading
case
interpreting
that
statute,
the
bradley
case
was
a
1983
case
in
which
the
defendant
was
a
school
board.
there
is
also
the
statute
providing
financial
assistance
to
"local
educational
agencies",
bearing
the
financial
burden
of
a
school
disaggregation
order.
so,
that
where
there
is
the
established
line
and
there
is
congressional
reliance,
they
would
appear
to
be
really
a
rule
that
we
have
arrived
at
which
remains
only
to
be
announced.
mr.
oscar
chase
it
is
reconcilable,
yes
but
it
is
also
reconcilable
and
i
think
more
so
given
the
language
that
congress
chose
to
use,
they
focused
on
the
agency.
it
is
reconcilable,
i
think
more
happily
with
the
point
that
appellants
present
here,
your
honor.
of
course,
defendants
would
have
this
court
turn
its
back
on
that
twenty
years
of
decision
of
law
and
defendant
argues
principally
that
the
logic
of
monroe
against
pape
requires
a
similar
holding
for
these
persons,
these
boards
of
education
which
it
says
"fulfill
an
important
governmental
role".
let
us
see
how
this
would
frustrate
the
statute,
both
its
purposes
and
its
language.
1983
is
a
statute
which
applies
only
where
there
is
color
of
state
law.
it
will
almost
always
be
the
case,
if
not
always,
that
a
corporation
or
person
acting
on
the
color
of
law
is
fulfilling
an
important
governmental
role.
so
that
under
defendant's
view,
when
the
statute
applies
when
you
get
into
it,
you
are
also
shunted
out
of
it
because
you
are
really
by
definition
fulfilling
that
important
role.
such
a
reading
would,
aside
from
being
absurd,
and
i
submit
imputing
to
congress
an
intent
to
pass
a
meaningless
statute
in
that
context,
such
a
reading
would
allow
states
if
they
were
such
in
mind
to
evade
constitutional
obligations
by
setting
up
corporations
to
undertake
important
governmental
roles
and
one
thinks
of
smith
against
allwright
where
in
another
context
the
court
said
to
the
democratic
party
of
texas
back
in
those
days,
"you
can
not
set
up
a
jaybird
society
and
tell
us
that
is
not
the
state
of
texas
operating
the
primers."
i
think
the
case
is
relevant
its
spirit
if
not
in
precise
holding.
mr.
oscar
chase
yes
sir.
mr.
oscar
chase
well
your
honor,
i
think
that
that
is
an
important
ingredient
of
our
case
because
under
the
monroe
holding,
a
city
is
simply
not
a
person
and
we
do
not
think
our
case
presents
the
court
with
the
necessity
of
reconsidering
that
holding.
but
we
think
that
the
record
is
so
clear
that
the
board
of
education
is
not
an
arm
of
the
city,
that
that
probably
--
mr.
oscar
chase
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
oscar
chase
no,
it
does
not,
but
it
does
have
the
power
to
obtain
funds
from
federal,
state,
city
and
private
sources.
mr.
oscar
chase
well
four,
private
as
well,
although
the
governmental
and
actually
the
bulk
of
it.
but
one
thinks
of
the
court's
opinion
in
mt.
healthy
against
doyle
where
the
question
there
was
whether
a
school
board
was
an
arm
of
the
state
and
the
mere
fact
that
it
got
funds
from
the
state
,
did
not
make
it
an
arm
of
the
state
anymore
than
the
fact
that
the
board
of
education
gets
funds
from
the
city,
makes
it
"an
arm
of
the
city"
mr.
oscar
chase
it
is
a
corporation
and
like
any
corporation
can
sue
and
be
sued,
it
is
not
a
municipal
corporation
in
the
sense
that
a:
does
not
have
a
power
to
administer
law
within
a
geographic
area
and
perhaps
more
to
the
point
under
new
york
law,
it
is
not
so
considered.
the
new
york
constitution
defines
very
specifically
local
government
as
a
county,
city,
town
or
village,
does
not
include
an
under
decision
of
law
and
there
were
similar
provisions
in
the
general
municipal
law
which
are
even
more
on
the
fact
--
mr.
oscar
chase
it
is
not
a
private
corporation.
mr.
oscar
chase
no
it
is
not
--
well,
it
is
an
entity
that
is
in
between.
it
is
a
--
mr.
oscar
chase
a
corporation
charted
under
the
rules
of
the
state
which
are
separate
and
distinct
from
the
city
which
has
the
capacity
to
sue
and
be
sued
and
has
the
responsibility
to
administer
education
in
the
--
excuse
me
your
honor.
mr.
oscar
chase
well,
it
is
both
decisional
law
and
statutory
law
and
it
is
set
out
in
our
brief.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
oscar
chase
no,
the
constitution
provides
that
education
is
a
power
that
the
control
of
education
is
a
power
reserved
to
the
state
and
excludes
it
interestingly
on
the
constitutional
point,
it
is
reserved,
it
is
excluded
from
the
home
rule
provisions
of
the
new
york
constitution
which
do
define
the
sphere
of
influence
of
cities
and
is
a
further
indicia
of
the
fact
that
it
is
not
an
arm
of
the
city,
but
it
is
in
primarily
in
statutory
law
your
honor
that
the
board
is
established
as
a
separate
entity.
it
is
in
the
new
york
education
of
law.
now,
your
honors
i
had
addressed,
the
point
as
to
how
the
defendant's
position
would
frustrate
the
language
of
the
statute
and
let's
take
a
look
now
at
the
purposes
of
the
statute
and
how
this
argument
fits
in
there.
the
purpose
of
section
1983
is
revealed
in
the
title
by
which
it
is
referred
to
in
the
statutes
at
large
and
in
the
debate,
an
act
to
enforce
the
provisions
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
i
may
say
parenthetically
that
in
monroe
the
court
referred
to
it
as
the
ku
klux
act
which
i
think
frankly,
well
somewhat
accurate
is
a
misnomer,
the
true
purpose,
the
true
title
was
an
act
to
enforce
the
provisions
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
it
has
been
agreed
that
that
purpose
was
its
primary
purpose,
even
justice
frankfurter,
in
his
decent
in
monroe,
said
that
the
purpose
of
section
1
of
this
act
of
1871
was
to
protect
against
constitutional
violations
through
the
authority
enhanced
by
the
majesty
and
dignity
of
the
state.
just
as
here
we
have
this
corporation
setup
by
the
board,
given
some
powers
by
the
state
and
then
in
this
case
has
violated
people's
right.
it
is
the
very
situation
in
which
the
statute
section
1
was
intended
to
apply
and
when
the
legislature,
when
congress
used
the
word
all
persons
are
liable,
it
clearly
intended
to
include
such
corporations.
we
know
this
because
first
the
common
understanding
of
the
term
corporation,
or
persons
in
a
legal
sense
included
corporations.
this
court
said
as
much
as
early
as
1838,
it
was
just
an
axiom
unless
someone
tells
this
otherwise
the
term
persons
in
a
statute
means
corporations
and
beyond
that
we
have
the
dictionary
act
adopted
by
the
same
congress
of
1871
which
said
in
it
that
you
may
take
it
that
we
mean
corporations
as
well
as
corporeal
persons
when
we
use
the
term
persons.
now,
counsel
is
quite
aware
that
the
dictionary
act
was
rejected
as
precedent
as
binding
in
the
monroe
case
because
in
monroe
the
court
found
a
special
intent
to
treat
municipalities
differently
from
other
persons
and
we
submit
that
no
such
finding
can
be
made
with
regard
to
this
kind
of
corporation.
and
let
me
explain
why
this
is
so.
first,
the
sherman
amendment
in
terms
would
have
imposed
liability
on
cities
for
acts
of
violence
done
within
their
borders
in
terms
--
on
the
county,
city
or
parish
"in
which
the
riotous
acts
occurred".
there
was
no
discussion
of
corporations
such
as
the
board
of
education
which
exist
for
particular
purpose.
any
such
discussion
would
have
been
absurd,
no
one
would
have
thought
to
impose
liability
on
a
board
of
education
if
they
had
thought
of
it
because
riotous
acts
occurred
in
the
school
district.
but
i
think
even
more
important,
boards
of
education
were
creatures
that
were
only
barely
gaining
their
own
under
american
law
at
the
time
of
these
debates.
certainly,
they
were
never
mentioned
during
the
debates,
there
is
no
indication
that
they
were
before
the
congress,
we
just
do
not
know
what
congress
would
have
thought
about
its
powers
to
impose
liabilities
on
these
creatures
of
law
even
if
we
do
know
what
congress
thought
about
its
power
vis-a-vis
municipalities.
so
that
a
holding
which
would
extend
the
legislative
history
reading
in
monroe
yet
further
to
include
these
entities
would
really
rest
if
i
may
say
so,
on
the
legislative
history
of
imagination,
of
surmise
rather
than
the
legislative
history
of
scholarship.
an
additional
point
on
the
relevance
of
the
sherman
amendment
is
that
we
must
recall
that
the
sherman
amendment
was
an
additional
section
to
the
act
of
1871,
it
would
have
been
tacked
on
the
end.
mr.
oscar
chase
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
oscar
chase
thank
you
your
honor.
your
honor,
at
this
point
i
would
like
to
turn
with
the
court's
permission
to
the
second
aspect
of
our
position
that
the
defendants
can
be
required
under
section
1983
that
is
the
official
defendants
can
be
required
to
use
their
official
powers
to
make
whole
the
plaintiffs.
that
is
they
can
be
required
in
the
words
of
this
court
in
griffin
v.
prince
edward
county
to
use
the
powers
that
is
theirs,
to
remedy
the
wrongs
that
they
have
done.
now,
let
me
begin
by
saying
that
here
unlike
plaintiff's
claim
against
the
school
board,
it
is
undeniable
that
an
order
to
the
defendant
mayor
in
his
official
capacity
will
have
some
impact
on
the
municipality
and
thus
the
limit
in
monroe
is
at
least
arguably
relevant.
but
we
contend
it
is
not
determinative,
because
it
is
beyond
dispute
that
the
defendants
are
in
their
official
capacity
subject
to
1983,
for
injunctive
and
other
purposes
and
that
was
held
in
kenosha
that
the
quality
of
personhood
does
not
depend
on
the
type
of
relief
sought.
mr.
oscar
chase
you
mean
the
official
defendants,
no
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
so
because
under
state
law
which
at
least
might
apply
to
that
end
of
the
case,
the
liability
of
the
defendants
is
limited
to
such
amounts
as
are
in
the
treasury,
even
in
their
official
capacities.
that
is
in
general,
municipal
law,
section
70
of
the
new
york
code.
so
that
i
do
not
think,
i
think
that
the
situation
would
there
be
as
in
any
case
in
which
the
defendant
turns
out
to
be
judgment
proof.
the
plaintiff
gets
a
judgment,
but
he
can
not
enforce
it.
but,
still
plaintiffs
would
prefer
to
get
the
judgment
and
worry
about
enforcing
it
later.
mr.
oscar
chase
no
your
honor
i
do
not,
because
i
think
that
a
rule
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
or
a
rule
of
remedial
scope
should
not
turn
on
the
likelihood
that
defendants
either
can
or
will
pay
the
judgment.
i
think
that
those
are
very
separate.
mr.
oscar
chase
yes
and
i
think
that
the
general
principle
is
the
same,
i
do
not
think
that
the
court
should
erect
special
rules
to
protect
public
entities
unless
congress
has
done
so,
where
they
are
otherwise
subject
to
the
terms
of
the
statute.
mr.
oscar
chase
well,
your
honor
that
--
i
believe
not
because
of
the
special
reasons
that
run
imbler
the
court
mentioned
and
so
forth,
but
i
think
that
that
is
a
question
that
is
not
before
the
court,
it
is
a
difficult
question
i
concede.
it
is
one
that
had
the
defendants
properly
raised
below
or
perhaps
may
even
have
a
chance
to
raise
below
if
this
court
reverses,
we
would
appreciate
an
opportunity
to
convince
the
lower
court
and
maybe
ultimately
this
court.
mr.
oscar
chase
we
understand
your
honor.
i
was
about
to
say
that
a
logically
consistent
system
of
1983
jurisprudence
would
require,
taking
into
account
the
kenosha
case
and
the
other
cases
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
in
which
the
court
has
affirmed
lower
court
holdings
ordering
defendants
in
their
official
capacity
to
make
restitution
to
plaintiffs.
that
those
cases
require
a
similar
holding
here
and
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
this
is
an
issue
that
can
not
be
decided
in
either
direction
without
some
infringement
on
starry
decisis
principles.
the
court
is
caught
between
conflicting
lines
of
cases
and
i
suggest
that
that
plaintiff's
position
is
the
best
way
to
resolve
them
because
it
looks
back
to
the
fundamental
purpose
of
section
1983,
the
purpose
of
protecting
constitutional
rights
and
enforcing
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
anything
which
would
be
found
in
the
legislative
history
that
might
be
contrary
wise,
all
was
in
the
context
of
the
sherman
amendment
which
was
really
not
terribly
relevant
to
section
1
at
all
and
in
so
far
as
the
monroe
case
does
stand
against
the
position
that
plaintiffs
take.
we
would
make
at
least
three
points.
in
monroe,
the
city
was
the
defendant.
so,
that
just
in
the
narrow
starry
decisis,
the
case
is
inapplicable.
second
and
more
broadly,
plaintiffs
do
not
here
seek
to
render
monroe
meaningless.
we
are
not
saying
that
the
plaintiffs
in
monroe
could
have
sued
the
mayor
daley
of
chicago
and
obtained
a
judgment
because
some
police
officer
beat
them
up.
mayor
daley
in
that
case
did
not
wrongfully
exercise
his
official
powers.
the
analogy
is
very
close
to
rizzo
against
goode
where
then
police
commissioner
rizzo
could
not
be
held
liable
the
court
thought
because
some
of
his
officers
had
run
a
muck
allegedly,
nor
could
under
our
view
the
plaintiff
in
monroe
sue
the
police
officer
in
his
official
capacity,
because
the
police
officer
in
that
capacity
has
no
authority
to
dispense
public
funds
to
make
whole
injured
plaintiffs.
so
that
the
integrity
of
monroe
is
not
necessarily
at
issue
here
and
i
would
like
with
that
background
--
mr.
oscar
chase
no
your
honor.
we
believe
that--
not
at
all,
the
defendants
themselves
acted
wrongfully.
so,
we
allege.
mr.
oscar
chase
well,
if
the
federal
district
judge
orders
the
school
board
or
its
members
to
make
restitution
and
they
in
the
normal
course
of
the
business,
as
they
would
issue
a
directive
or
a
voucher
to
the
holder
of
their
funds,
the
city
controller,
that
is
all
they
could
be
reasonably
expected
to
do,
yes.
i
would
assume
in
the
normal
course
of
the
events
that
as
under
state
law,
controller
is
required
to
pay
money
on
vouchers,
lawfully
issued
by
the
board
and
he
would
pay
it.
mr.
oscar
chase
if
we
came--
oh!
because
of
new
york's
financial
embarrassments.
well,
your
honor
i
like
to
think
as
i
said
to
the
chief
justice
that
that
will
not
be
relevant
in
making
a
rule
and
it
is
going
to
be
applicable
for
those
of
the
the
cities
that
are
maybe
better
managed
or
luckier
possibly.
i
would
further
urge
that
our
position
--
mr.
oscar
chase
if
there
had
never
been
an
action
for
injunction?
mr.
oscar
chase
well,
that
raises
the
question
really
i
think,
if
i
mar
is
whether
or
not,
this
restitution
stands
in
law
or
equity
and
i
am
not
sure
that
this
is
the
kind
of
issue
that
the
difference
is
important,
i
think
this
is
what
--
mr.
oscar
chase
that
is
really
our
position,
yes
sir.
i
think
we
should
state
that,
in
this
case
i
should
say
that
the
case
does
arise
in
the
context
of
an
injunctive
action
and
that
it
is
traditional
that
restitution
is
considered
an
incident
of
equity,
but
after
the
abolition
of
law
and
equity
distinction,
i
am
not
sure
how
terribly
important
that
is.
i
think
the
power
is
there
in
the
district
court
because
if
the
power
is
not
there,
using
the
defendant's
approach,
a
defendant
official
would
be
subject
to
section
1983
because
he
has
official
powers
and
then
when
the
court
seeks
to
order
him
to
exercise
those
official
powers,
it
would
be
the
very
same
powers
that
he
would
use
to
say,
oh
no
you
can
not
do
that
to
me
because
that
would
be
the
same
as
having
an
impact
on
the
entity
that
i
serve.
so,
here
again
it
would
be
way
of
making
the
statute
if
you
will,
consume
itself.
i
do
not
think
that
is
what
congress
had
in
mind.
now,
the
lower
court
was
impressed
by
this
eleventh
amendment
analogy
that
it
found
and
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
that.
the
eleventh
amendment
of
course
is
a
prohibition,
it
says
that
there
shall
be
no
suits
by
a
citizen
against
a
state
and
i
have
a
great
difficult
in
analogizing
that
provision
which
is
wholly
negative
to
a
provision
which
had
it
as
its
prime
purpose
and
expansive
of
view
of
federal
power
to
protect
constitutional
rights.
secondly,
i
find
it
difficult
to
believe
that
the
congress
did
enacted
section
1983,
had
in
its
mind
this
eleventh
amendment
construct,
when
the
ex
parte
young
was
not
even
decided
until
about
1908
and
this
is
a
congress
that
could
never
--
i
don't
think
it
contemplated
the
unusual
chain
of
events
that
led
to
ex
parte
young
which
has
resolved
those
competing
considerations.
they
are
relevant.
if
there
is
an
intent
to
insulate
municipalities,
it
can
be
found
in
only
one
place
and
that
is
in
the
rejection
of
the
so
called
sherman
amendment
that
would
have
made
cities
vicariously
liable
for
acts
that
it
did
not
commit
that
were
committed
within
its
borders
and
in
monroe
of
course,
the
court
read
the
rejection
of
the
sherman
amendment
to
mean
that
congress
had
decided,
it
had
no
power
to
impose
"liability"
on
cities.
but
of
course,
that
is
different
than
saying
that
the
congress
thought
that
it
had
to
insulate
the
cities
from
even
and
the
ancillary
effect
of
orders
against
those
whom
it
--
or
concede
did
have
power
to
affect.
secondly,
we
think
that
the
court
in
monroe
read
the
legislative
history
rather
too
broadly,
in
the
very
language,
the
mr.
justice
douglas
quoted
in
monroe,
he
quoted
representative
poland
who
was
a
reconstruction
republican,
believed
four-square
in
the
fourteenth
amendment,
but
said
in
his
one
speech
that
mr.
justice
douglas
quoted
that
we
do
not
have
the
power
to
impose
and
"obligations
on
municipalities"
and
we
think
that
the
correct
reading
of
that
legislative
history
was
something
like
this,
even
the
reconstruction
republicans
recognize
that
in
1871
there
was
no
power
to
say
to
a
city,
you
shall
have
a
police
force
on
the
part
of
the
congress,
you
shall
have
the
police
force,
you
shall
police
what
goes
on
in
the
neighborhoods
and
so
forth.
the
states
decided
what
the
obligations
of
the
cities
were.
that
being
the
case,
they
said,
"how
can
we
in
good
faith
or
even
constitutionally"
tell
them,
you
are
liable
for
not
doing
that
which
we
do
not
have
the
power
to
tell
you
to
do
in
the
first
place?
and
i
do
not
have
the
time
to
read
from
the
record,
and
from
the
brief,
but
i
think
that
your
honors
will
find
that
the
key
republicans
who
were
in
support
of
this
basic
approach
of
section
1983
did
have
difficulty,
but
only
on
that
score.
they
believe
they
had
the
power
to
impose
a
liability,
but
not
obligations
on
municipalities.
so,
we
find
that
the
eleventh
amendment
analogy
is
simply
not
supported
by
reference
to
the
record.
congressmen
like
congressman
curt
who
was
against
everything
they
did.
he
was
a
democrat
who
thought
the
fourteenth
amendment
did
not
give
the
powers
that
the
republicans
thought.
i
do
not
think
the
court
should
look
to
his
quotes
and
use
them
to
interpret
a
law
that
he
was
against
right
from
a
to
z.
so,
we
think
that
the
legislative
history
does
not
support
this
special
intent
to
protect
municipalities
and
i
will
if
your
honor,
please
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
