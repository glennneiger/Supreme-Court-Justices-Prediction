mr.
l.
kevin
sheridan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
answer
to
the
questions
concerning
the
status
of
the
defendant
board
of
education.
the
new
york
law
indicates
that
this
is
a
hybrid
entity.
the
state
constitution
provides
that
every
child
shall
be
guaranteed
a
free
public
education,
this
provision
of
state
constitution,
the
state
board
of
regions
and
the
commissioner
of
education.
certain
state
cases
indicate
that
for
pedagogical
purpose
at
the
very
least.
boards
of
education
are
arms
of
the
state
coming
perilously
close
to
an
eleventh
amendment
defense
being
available,
we
can
urge
that
in
light
of
this
court's
and
a
healthy
decision.
other
cases
indicate
that
based
up
on
its
slotted
city
funding,
its
relationship
under
the
city
charter
with
the
city,
and
of
the
e
education
law,
with
respect
to
appointment
of
members
of
the
board
of
education,
that
is
as
a
city
agency.
i
do
not
think
that
is
dispositive
determinations
case
your
honors.
that
can
be
absolutely
no
dispute
it
performs
a
critical,
expensive,
important,
governmental
function.
this
court
in
national
league
of
cities
v.
usery
treated
boards
of
educations
and
public
hospital
systems
as
just
as
clearly
governmental
entities
as
what
we
generally
think
of
as
municipal
corporations.
to
answer
mr.
justice
marshall's
question
or
to
attempt
to
answer
it,
is
it
a
municipal
corporation,
what
do
you
call
it
i
think
we
would
fairly
characterize
it
as
a
quasi-municipal
corporation.
i
think
mcquillin,
on
municipal
corporations
would
probably
discuss
it
that
way.
there
are
a
host
of
arrangements
whereby
local
boards
of
education
are
established.
right
now
the
mayor
of
the
city
of
new
york
would
like
to
have
a
clearly
city
agency
with
him
appointing
a
local
chancellor.
if
that
would
affect
the
outcome
of
this
case
because
we
change
the
nature
or
the
appointment
and
what
is
the
power
--.
mr.
l.
kevin
sheridan
under
the
city
charter
apparently
it
is
set
up
that
way.
mr.
l.
kevin
sheridan
the
mayor
appoints
two
members
of
the
board
i
believe
your
honor
and
the
bar
presidents,
i
think
each
appoint
one
member.
it
is
in
the
brief,
i
think
that
is
the
way
it
is
constituted.
then
they
have
certain
statutory
authority
of
new
york
state
education
law.
but
that
is
with
governance
and
management
of
the
local
school
district.
mr.
l.
kevin
sheridan
no
your
honor,
many
--
mr.
l.
kevin
sheridan
which
in
this
case
--
mr.
l.
kevin
sheridan
they
do
not
issue
bonds,
they
can
not
borrow
independently.
they
can
be
given
funds
by
the
state
or
the
federal
government
or
private
policies
as
counsel
noted.
i
think
that
bring
them
even
closer
to
municipality.
i
frankly
do
not
believe
it
should
be
dispositive.
i
do
not
live
in
city
of
new
york,
i
live
i
in
a
suburb
with
a
local
board
of
education
taxes
and
can
borrow.
mr.
l.
kevin
sheridan
within
the
state
of
new
york,
surely,
your
honor.
in
fact
in
many
smaller
localities
probably
the
most
expensive
governmental
function
is
provision
of
education.
i
am
not
trying
to
argue
against
myself.
those
situations,
and
may
i
look
for
certain
purpose
and
more
like
the
separate
municipality,
here
it
is
mixed.
one,
i
do
not
think
the
court
should
be
engaged
in
this
type
of
logic
shopping.
so
that
you
are
going
to
have
to--
how
many
angels
in
the
head
of
the
pin.
if
you
want
go
case
by
case,
deciding
and
then
it
had
to
to
come
this
court
for
final
resolution,
is
this
board
of
education
so
like
--
mr.
l.
kevin
sheridan
my
recollection
was
the
separate
--
mr.
l.
kevin
sheridan
okay,
then
the
answer
your
honor
is
--
mr.
l.
kevin
sheridan
looking
not
only
to
the
state
statutes,
but
the
court
decisions
your
honor.
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
has
quite
clearly
said
that
this
is
an
arm
of
the
state,
not
subject
to
municipal
home
rule
provisions,
it
is
a
separate
body
politic
and
corporate
that
may
sue
and
be
sued
in
its
own
name.
mr.
l.
kevin
sheridan
the
statute
merely
establishes
the
board
of
education
and
that
is
--
mr.
l.
kevin
sheridan
i
do
not
know
your
honor,
if
you
wish
--
i
can
cite
it
to
the
court.
mr.
l.
kevin
sheridan
your
honor,
in
the
case
of
an
action
against
the
board
of
education
--
mr.
l.
kevin
sheridan
well,
this
is
mixed,
board
is
sued
as
an
entity,
a
party
defendant,
we
have
other
defendants
here
who
are
public
officials
sued
solely
in
their
official
capacity.
they
have
no
independent
power
to
order
the
control
the
city
of
new
york
to
draw
a
check
unless
there
is
a
judgment
which
they
would
forward
to
the
controller.
mr.
l.
kevin
sheridan
i
would
hope
the
controller
would
pay
it
if
it
was
situation
--
mr.
l.
kevin
sheridan
general
city
funds,
a
fund
that
actually
for
claims
and
judgments,
these
be
public
money,
there
is
not
question
on
it
tax
wise.
your
honors,
i
am
not
quite
sure
i
understand
my
opponent's
argument.
at
one
point
he
says,
monroe
v.
pape
is
not
in
this
case,
it
does
not
have
to
be
dispositive
here,
but
next
moment,
he
is
arguing
it
is
incorrectly
decided,
i
would
like
to
speak
briefly
on
that
point.
justice
douglas
in
monroe
v.
pape,
justice
marshall
in
monroe
v.
county
of
alameda,
justice
rehnquist
in
city
of
kenosha
and
i
might
add,
mr.
justice
brennan
and
his
dissent
in
aldinger
v.
howard
all
discussed
the
legislative
history,
what
is
now
1983.
uniformly,
no
dissent
on
this
issue,
not
intended
to
reach
local
governmental
subdivision.
congress,
since
1961,
i
believe
has
acquiesced
in
this
view.
there
is
presently
pending
in
both
the
senate
and
the
house,
in
measure
--
and
it
is
senate
35
introduced
by
senator
mathius
in
the
senate
proposing
to
overrule
that
decision
as
well
as
imbler
v.
pachtman,
and
various
other
cases.
congress
has
been
aware
of
the
interpretation
placed
upon
1983
by
this
court,
it
has
acquiesced
this
interpretation
which
to
most
lawyers
meant
you
could
not
get
our
money
judgment
against
the
municipality.
when
congress
was
dissatisfied
with
the
alyeska
pipeline
decision,
the
next
year
he
changed
law,
at
least
on
the
civil
rights
action.
i
would
suggest
these
considerations
indicate
that
this
matter
is
appropriately
to
be
addressed
by
congress
which
has
acquiesced
through
16
years
in
this
line
of
decisions,
in
a
sense
your
honors
have
been
grafted
onto
the
statute,
an
important
judicial
clause
that
takes
on
independent
meaning.
but
if
we
are
going
to
reexamine,
the
intent
to
the
congress
at
1871,
i
would
suggest
that
congress
not
only
was
not
aware
of
the
need
for
devising
a
fiction
such
as
ex
parte
young
represents,
but
it
never
would
have
seen
any
need
to.
this
was
a
statute
directed
at
nightriders,
the
ku
klux
klan
and
state
officials
would
not
accord
justice
to
people
injured.
today
and
i
think
no
issue
to
this,
it
guarantees
to
public
employees,
their
job
security,
it
guarantees
to
welfare
recipients,
the
right
to
pre-termination
hearing.
it
may
even
provide
for
notice
to
cut
off
gas
and
electric
companies,
it
has
come
a
long,
long
way
and
sometimes
we
have
had
boards
of
education
or
cities
named
defendants
in
1983
action.
mr.
l.
kevin
sheridan
it
certainly
did
your
honor
and
i
come
from
the
city
where
the
traditional
liberalism
is
fairly
widespread
and
i
am
not
going
to
take
issue
with
the
development
of
law.
in
one
sense
this
has
become
a
great
charter
of
liberties
analogous
to
the
sherman
act,
not
the
sherman
amendment,
the
sherman
act
and
the
economics
of
that.
i
appreciate
that.
nobody
wants
to
roll
the
clock
back.
let
us
look
at
the
context
in
which
relief
has
been
accorded
and
let
us
look
at
the
relief
accorded.
typically
injunctive,
declaratory
relief
and
incidentally
maybe
damages,
i
know
that
but
before
this
court,
in
the
lafleur
case,
city
of
cleveland
board
of
education
was
primarily
should
they
get
an
order
striking
down
mandatory
maternity
leave.
court
noted
in
opinion
that
appropriate
damages
or
injunctive
relief,
back
pay
within
state.
as
far
as
i
am
aware,
this
is
the
first
case
that
squarely
poses
to
this
court,
the
issue
of
how
this
statute
should
be
construed
and
what
is
really
an
issue
is
damages
and
this
is
an
equitable
restitution,
it
is
not
some
sort
of
equitable
decree.
this
is
just
like
the
money
judgment
you
get
and
you
can
sell
the
property,
and
the
courthouse
steps.
mr.
l.
kevin
sheridan
your
honor,
i
can
not
predict
the
outcome
of
this
case.
mr.
l.
kevin
sheridan
i
think
to
the
extent
we
are
going
to
engage
in
formalistic
type
distinctions
then
my
case
is
closer
to
a
municipality
than
the
more
independent
school
district.
i
think
i
have
got
a
a
fortiori
case
i
suggest
it
should
be
decided
more
broadly.
mr.
l.
kevin
sheridan
your
honor,
this
is
so
unknown
to
me,
i
am
asked
to
predict
what
the
controller
will
do,
he
may
send
it
right
back
to
the
official
--
mr.
l.
kevin
sheridan
okay,
if
it
does
not
run
against
the
corporate
entity,
it
runs
against
the
individual
sued
solely
in
his
official
capacity.
i
am
at
a
loss
to
know
the
authority
for
the
comptroller
to
pay
that
judgment.
he
has
--
mr.
l.
kevin
sheridan
all
it
does,
it
enhances
my
worries.
you
honor,
i
do
not
know
what
the
controller
would
do,
i
do
not
know
what
the
district
court
would
say,
with
the
remedies
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
context.
it
is
so
unorthodox
what
these
people
propose.
i
mean,
if
you
order
chancellor
of
the
board
of
education
to
integrate
schools,
for
bus.
he
does
not
do
it,
your
remedy
is
clear,
contempt.
if
he
does
certain
other
things,
there
is
no
guarantee,
the
city
is
going
to
pay
his
contempt
judgment,
this
is
in
indemnity
clause
of
statute,
but
there
is
not
guarantee.
if
he
is
sued
in
his
individual
capacity
because
he
unconstitutionally
dismissed
the
child
from
school,
i
mean
there
is
a
damage
aware,
absent
that
indemnity
statute
which
this
court
has
held
irrelevant
to
determination
of
this
issue
in
the
moor
case.
mr.
l.
kevin
sheridan
they
are
the
real
party
in
interest
your
honor,
they
really
are,
we
are
not
that.
mr.
l.
kevin
sheridan
i
do
not
know
your
honor,
i
do
not
know
if
you
have
controller
here
is
defendant.
they
do
not?
i
have
the
controller.
mr.
l.
kevin
sheridan
your
honor,
if
the
court
is
going
to
advise
the
parties
that
a
judgment
can
be
enacted
that
the
parties
do
not
have
to
pay
any
attention
to,
then
i
think
that
judgment
is
wrong.
it
does
not
make
any
sense.
mr.
l.
kevin
sheridan
it
might
be
improper
as
an
advisory
opinion,
maybe
we
should
be
ignorant
as
to
what
to
do
and
then
litigate
that
issue
frankly,
i
do
not
think
is
before
the
court,
i
think
it
impinges
upon
the
decisional
process,
how
much
uncertainty
you
want
to
--
mr.
l.
kevin
sheridan
your
honor,
very
respectfully,
i
disagree
with
my
friends
advise
to
the
court,
i
think
it
is
quite
important
that
you
think
out,
i
am
sure
you
will.
the
implications
of
what
is
being
decided
in
this
case.
it
really
gets
down
to
how
we
take
in
section
1983
far,
far
beyond,
anything
its
draftsmen
congress
did
enacted
it
ever
contemplated.
mr.
l.
kevin
sheridan
it
would
your
honor
only
pursuant
to
a
local
indemnity
statute
and
in
not
all
cases,
we
pick
and
choose
frankly,
the
cases
in
which
we
will
indemnify.
mr.
l.
kevin
sheridan
your
honor,
i
am
not
sure
i
fully
comprehend
the
the
point
at
this
kind
of
question,
but
i
do
recall
that
mr.
justice
marshall's
moore
v.
county
of
alameda
opinion
that
was
mentioned
the
fact
that
there
was
a
local
state
statute
indemnifying
the
officials
sued
there
and
it
was
urged
there
that
this
should
affect
the
outcome
of
that
case.
the
court
specifically
rejected
that
line
of
reason.
what
i
think
is
critical
here
is
not
whether
this
is
indemnity
or
what
local
officials
are
going
to
do,
i
raised
the
question
of
do
you
have
a
judgment
that
makes
practical
sense
to
answer
because
i
see
it
as
a
difficulty.
another
reason
for
the
court
not
extending
1983
in
the
fashion
tear
sought
to
extend
it.
the
more
fundamental
question
your
honors
is
one
really
or
both
construction
of
the
statute,
this
court
in
one
sense
has
one
line
of
case,
that
is
consistently
indicated
should
be
limited
in
its
enforcement
,
the
way
the
congress
that
enacted
it
and
intended
it.
let
me
be
--
mr.
l.
kevin
sheridan
not
uniformly,
your
honor,
not
uniformly
at
all.
mr.
l.
kevin
sheridan
your
honor,
plaintiff's
bar
has
as
much
interest
in
settling
those
cases
as
we
do.
mr.
l.
kevin
sheridan
i
do
not
know
the
number
that
we
have
your
honor.
i
know
some
are
litigated
and
they
get
expensive
sometimes.
i
do
not
think
that
is
one
of
the
the
point
here,
one
point
i
would
like
to
make
as
i
understand
the
petitioner?s
argument.
they
really
want
to
take
1983
liability
imposing
on
municipality
and
other
governmental
entities,
in
a
situation
which
would
operate
even
more
harshly
than
the
aborted
sherman
amendment
would
have
acted.
it
is
notable
that
there
is
absolutely
no
claim
here
at
the
official
conduct
complained
of
would
be
actionable
as
against
the
individuals
involved
in
their
individual
capacities.
this
is
sort
of
the
penultimate
strict
liability,
you
were
wrong
when
you
had
a
mandatory
maternity
leave
policy
for
whatever
good
motives
concerned
for
the
mother,
the
child,
the
school
children,
you
were
wrong.
we
now
have
a
class
action
based
upon
the
enlightenment
flourished
by
this
court
and
you
should
not
have
such
policies
however
well
intended.
it
is
not
simply
respondeat
superior
liability,
you
did
not
pick
your
employees.
more
precisely,
it
is
government
qua
government
in
your
legislative
and
executive
and
administrative
capacity
you
were
wrong.
so
now
you
are
going
to
pay
damages
and
lets
not
kid
about
it,
you
are
going
to
pay
damages
that
is
what
they
want
that
is
what
they
asked
for
an
amended
complaint.
they
do
not
ask
for
equitable
restitution.
now
you
are
going
to
pay
for
that.
106
years
after
congress
act
with
not
one
thought
in
its
mind
that
it
was
doing
anything
like
this.
undoubtedly
that
congress
also
did
not
realize
that
it
was
giving
job
security
to
tenured
public
employees,
welfare
recipients,
any
number
of
host
of
all
instances
where
i
take
absolute
no
issue
with
the
actions
of
this
court.
mr.
l.
kevin
sheridan
the
basis
for
relief
your
honor
is
1983,
to
date
this
court
has
not
said
they
sue
directly
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
l.
kevin
sheridan
i
appreciate
that
your
honor,
it
is
expanding
fourteenth
amendment
notions
what
due
process
and
equal
protection
guarantee.
mr.
l.
kevin
sheridan
it
may
have
been
a
reference
to
the
earlier
reconstruction
acts
making
it
violation,
criminal
violation,
so
now
you
have
in
addition
have
a
civil
remedy
for
this
type
of
action.
your
honors
--he
same
need
for
a
fiction
and
this
court
has
itself
characterized
ex
parte
young
as
devising
a
fictional
remedy,
the
same
need
for
a
fiction
is
called
for
here
and
why
i
will
be
blunt,
when
it
comes
to
damages
and
damage
actions
1983
is
about
as
blunderbuss
an
instrument
as
there
exist,
it
is
not
tailored
to
the
situation,
it
is
not
like
title
7,
where
you
have
procedures
to
go
through
and
limits,
discretion
of
the
court
with
respect
to
back
pay.
here
you
establish
liability
and
they
say
ipso
facto
we
get
the
judgment,
you
show
the
liability
and
the
damages
and
that
is
it
case
is
over.
a
line
of
cases
involving
officials
and
whatever
immunity
they
enjoy
for
their
official
action,
this
court
has
placed
a
gloss
in
1983
by
reference
to
common
law
immunities.
i
am
not
asking
for
a
common
law
immunity
to
be
found
somewhere.
i
think
my
job
is
easy
your
honors.
i
am
saying
here
we
know
what
the
intent
of
the
congress
was,
no
such
judgments
allowed
against
municipalities
or
local
sub
divisions
of
the
states.
we
do
not
have
to
look
to
harper
&
james
on
the
law
of
torts.
your
honors,
if
the
plaintiff's,
petitioners
here
prevail
in
this
case
they
will
have
opened
up
a
major
area
for
litigation
which
will
be
ruinously
expensive
for
municipalities
boards
of
education.
there
is
no
action
taken
by
government
officials
today
that
probably
10-15
years
later
will
not
be
subject
to
constitutional
litigation
and
we
may
lose
the
best,
the
good
faith
under
this
theory
is
irrelevant.
now
on
these
circumstances,
your
honor
if
these
plaintiffs
and
the
class
action,
certified
class
action
i
do
not
know
how
many
were
involved
in
this
case,
could
conceivably
be
tens
of
millions
where
they
are
not
without
remedies
they
can
seek
a
the
preliminary
injunction,
district
court
and
go
to
state
court
to
get
relief.
there
is
a
balance
that
must
be
struck,
i
think
it
is
fairly
obvious
balance
without
being
slavish
the
intent
of
an
1871
congress,
the
court
can
consider
as
it
has
an
earlier
case
as
what
that
congress
intended
and
give
effect
to
it,
not
just
because
of
the
strictures
about
statutory
construction
in
judicial
legislation.
that
does
not
always
decide
cases.
i
would
suggest
that
when
you
study
and
consider
balance,
considerations
the
equity
is
here,
it
just
does
not
make
sense
to
allow
a
blunderbuss
instruments
such
as
this
to
be
made
available.
we
are
not
talking
about
equitable
restitution,
we
are
really
talking
about
damages
and
we
are
talking
damages
paid
to
classes
of
people,
god
knows
how
large
the
classes
will
be,
what
the
amounts
in
question
will
be
and
if
the
deeper
pocket
theory
of
tort
recovery
has
to
operate,
real
politics
of
tort
analysis
but
i
would
also
add,
the
pocket
is
not
deep,
its
broad,
its
not
deep.
it
is
not
irrelevant
that
the
cities
are
in
trouble,
they
are
having
trouble
providing
essential
services,
it
is
s
not
irrelevant
that
the
cities
can
not
practically
go
into
bankruptcy,
but
that
that
they
are
not
judgment
proof
that
is
not
irrelevant.
i
am
saying
please
think
seriously
about
imposing
additional
large,
substantial
burdens
on
governmental
entities
that
are
already
strapped
over
burdened
finding
it
difficult
to
function.
we
laid
off
5000
policeman
in
new
york
city,
11,000
teachers,
we
laid
off
lawyers,
we
laid
off
legal
secretaries,
law
secretaries
to
judges,
other
cities
are
in
the
same
boat,
small
municipalities,
small
school
systems,
they
could
be
literally
bankrupted.
mr.
l.
kevin
sheridan
there
is
some
complaint
about
the
mayor
not
appointing
some
until
the
election
was
over,
your
honor.
judges
enjoy
a
rare
status
in
new
york.
it
goes
beyond
even
good
behavior.
your
honors
i
think
you
have
my
point,
i
thank
you
for
indulgence.
