justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
say
monitory
relief
is
sought
against
them
in
their
official
capacity,
you
mean
monitory
relief
to
come
out
of
the
public
treasury
in
some
form?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
would
be
the
distinguisher
between
the
local
board
and
the
state
board?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
counsel,
now
do
not
you
have
to
take
things
in
context
when
you
are
talking
about
a
substantive
right
to
relief,
you
may
not
be
focusing
on
who
are
proper
defendants
and
vice
versa.
i
do
not
think
you
can
take
every
word
as
written
out
of
every
opinion
of
this
court
and
say
that
it
decides
a
question
that
the
court
may
not
have
been
focusing
on.
i
thought
from
your
earlier
comment,
you
probably
agreed
with
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
the
individual
defendants
in
a
capacity,
you
are
talking
about,
have
the
same
good
faith,
reasonable
type
of
defense
that
they
would
have
to
damages
action
against
them
personally
in
this
capacity?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
counsel,
this
morning
i
do
not
know
if
you
sat
here
during
the
argument
in
the
memphis.
i
gathered
that
all
parties
there
conceded
that
the
memphis,
utility
was
simply
a
division
of
the
city.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
mayor
ran
that
like
he
did
other
divisions.
i
take
if
that
is
not
the
case
with
the
new
york
city
school
board.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they
do
not
themselves
have
taxing
authority.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
it
varies
from
subdivision
to
subdivision
within
the
state
of
new
york?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
follow
that
up
if
i
may,
mr.
sheridan.
supposing
that
the
--
this
court
were
to
hold
in
accordance
with
your
opponents
contentions
that
the
individual
defendants
could
be
required
to
pay
public
moneys
to
redress
past
wrongs,
what
would
be
the
source
of
those
public
moneys?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
is
what
we
are
talking
about
here.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
there
were
a
judgment,
they
would
forward
it
to
the
controller
of
the
city
of
new
york.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
funds
would
he
pay
it
out
of?
