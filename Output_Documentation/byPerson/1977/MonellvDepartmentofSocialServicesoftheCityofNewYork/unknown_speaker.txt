unknown
speaker
okay,
just
before
you
go
on,
in
connection
with
brother
rehnquist's
question,
there
is
no
finding
here
and
no
issue
as
to
whether
the
individual
members
are
persons
or
purposes
of
prospective
relief?
unknown
speaker
mr.
chase.
unknown
speaker
what
extent
is
your
position
predicated
on
the
deal
that
the
new
york
board
of
education
is
a
separate
entity
from
the
city
of
new
york.
unknown
speaker
that
it
have
any
thought
of
levy
the
taxes?
unknown
speaker
or
issue
bonds?
unknown
speaker
they
come
from
all
three
of
those
don't
they?
unknown
speaker
is
the
board
of
education
and
here
what
you
would
call
a
municipal
corporation
a
sue,
that
can
sue,
be
sued
that
sort
of
thing.
unknown
speaker
does
the
constitution
of
new
york
provide
for
boards
of
education
as
constitutional
entities,
this
is
true
in
my
state
of
virginia,
for
example.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words
as
i
understand
it,
your
argument
in
this
phase
the
case
is
not
at
all
depended
upon
our
respondeat
superior
theory.
unknown
speaker
what
if
this
school
board
member
says
i
have
done
all
i
can
to
give
you
back
pay,
but
i
do
not
have
the
money
and
then
i
get
my
money
from
the
city.
is
he
then
like
a
police
officer?
unknown
speaker
would
you
have
a
stronger
case
if
you
came
from
somewhere
else
than
new
york?
do
you
think?
unknown
speaker
well,
will
you
be
here
making
the
same
claim
if
there
had
been
no
claim
for
equitable
relief
other
than
this
so
called
restitutionary
claim?
unknown
speaker
oh,
yeah.
unknown
speaker
so,
why
don't
you
just
say
that
if
i
am
suing
the
school
board
or
its
members,
i
can
sue
them
in
law
and
get
money
even
if
the
city
has
to
pay
it?
to
that
extent
monroe
just
does
not
reach
it.
is
that
really
your
position?
unknown
speaker
or
the
authority
to
borrow
money.
unknown
speaker
they
issue
bonds,
do
they?
unknown
speaker
and
it
remained
more
abundant
for
a
long
time
did
not
it?
unknown
speaker
and
you
are
saying
i
think
it
would
not
make
any
difference
to
the
school
board
where
had
its
own
sources
of
funds,
had
its
own
taxing
--
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
you
are
making
that
argument.
unknown
speaker
what
if
it
were
to
be
held
that
there
is
jurisdiction
to
give
a
judgment
against
the
school
board
member
as
a
member
of
an
all
the
judgment
would
require
him
to
do
is
to
send
the
voucher
into
the
controller
of
city
and
that
the
judgment
did
not
require
the
controller
to
pay
it.
would
that
satisfy
your
--
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
asking
to
predict
what
the
what
the
controller
would
do,
i
am
asking,
if
the
court
expressly
said
that
the
judgment
does
not
run
against
the
controller.
unknown
speaker
so,
my
question
is
would
that
satisfy
your
worries?
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course,
the
city
neither
the
city
not
the
controller
is
a
party
to
the
state.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
if
the
judgment
was
not
paid,
the
voucher
was
not
paid,
the
controller
would
be
held
in
contempt?
unknown
speaker
and
as
the
chief
justice
sees
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
your
friend,
that
your
friend
also
counseled
us
not
to
be
concerned
about
whether
the
court's
judgment
if
if
it
resumed
for
him,
whatever
be
acknowledged
or
have
any
response.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sheridan
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
significance
of
e
how
the
judgment
is
paid
in
a
case
of
this
kind
but
your
opponent
says,
we
should
not
be
concerned
with
that,
but
i
guess
you
are
saying
the
case
is
and
perhaps
we
should.
supposing
we
had
a
case
on
its
facts
like
monroe
against
pape,
where
police
officers
were
guilty
of
misconduct
and
the
police
chief
and
so
forth
and
there
were
judgment
for
damages
against
the
new
york
police
officers.
would
that
judgment
be
paid
from
municipal
firms?
unknown
speaker
but
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
impose
liability,
should
that
fact
be
considered
by
the
trial
court
in
the
1983
action?
and
if
not
in
a
police
officer
case,
why
should
it
be
so
in
a
school
board
case?
unknown
speaker
well
that
is
because
of
changes
in
the
construction
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
not
because
of
changes
in
the
construction
1983.
unknown
speaker
well
certainly
if
i
read
the
cases
that
i
think
you
are
referring
to
about
job
security
and
those
sort
of
things,
they
would
not
have
been
afforded
by
this
court
in
the
absence
of
some
construction
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
1983
just
says
a
if
you
have
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kevin
if
it
also
say
are
the
violation
of
laws
of
the
united
states.
a
new
statute
it
is
all
about.
unknown
speaker
did
you
lay
off
any
judges?
