j.
brennan,

the
other
case,
75-1914,
monell
versus
the
department
of
social
services,
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
section
1983
of
42
united
states
code
which
originated
a
107
years
ago,
as
section
1
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871,
makes
liable
in
damages
and
to
injunctive
release
and
i
quote
"every
person
who
under
cover
of
any
statute,
ordinance,
regulation,
customer
usage
of
any
state
or
territory,
subjects
or
causes
to
be
subjected,
any
citizen
of
the
united
states
or
other
person
within
the
jurisdiction
thereof,
to
the
deprivation
of
any
rights,
privileges
or
immunities,
secured
by
the
constitution
and
laws."
now
that
remedy
is
available
to
any
citizen
injured
in
violation
of
its
terms
and
words
of
its
congressional
sponsor
in
1971,
that
act,
"not
only
provides
a
civil
remedy
for
persons
whose
former
condition
may
have
been
that
of
slaves,
but
also
to
all
people
where,
under
color
of
state
law,
they
or
any
of
them
may
be
deprived
of
rights
to
which
they
are
entitled
under
the
constitution
by
reason
and
virtue
of
their
national
citizenship."
and
this
case
presents
the
question,
whether
the
remedy
is
available
against
school
boards,
municipalities,
and
other
local
government
bodies
and
the
answer
to
that
question
turns
on
whether
such
local
bodies
are
persons
within
the
term,
every
person
made
liable
by
the
section.
and
this
suit
was
brought
by
employees
of
the
new
york
city
board
of
education
against
the
board,
the
city
of
new
york,
and
various
board
and
city
officials
sued
in
their
official
capacities.
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit,
held
that
the
employees'
constitutional
rights
had
indeed
been
violated
by
the
board,
by
the
city
and
by
the
named
officials,
but
nevertheless
dismissed
the
employee's
suit.
the
two
courts
held
that
the
board
and
the
city
were
not
persons,
within
the
meeting
of
the
term
every
person,
and
therefore,
were
not
suable
under
section
1983.
the
two
courts
held
further
that
although
the
individual
officials
were
persons,
the
claims
for
damages
against
them
must
also
be
denied
because
such
damages
would
have
ultimately
to
be
paid
by
the
city
of
new
york,
and
therefore,
to
allow
the
damages
against
the
officials
would
be
to
circumvent
the
holding
the
city
was
not
a
person
suable
under
the
statute.
now,
this
holding
of
the
two
courts,
that
the
city
and
the
board
were
not
suable
persons,
rested
on
a
decision
of
this
court,
a
decision
17
years
ago
in
a
case
styled
monroe
versus
pape,
reported
in
365,
united
states.
that
was
a
suite
under
section
1983,
against
the
city
of
chicago
and
thirteen
of
its
police
officers.
the
complaint
alleged
that
the
thirteen
police
officers
without
a
warrant
broke
in
the
plaintiff's
home
in
the
early
morning,
routed
them
from
bed,
made
them
stand
naked
in
the
living
room
and
ransacked
every
room,
emptying
drawers
and
lifting
mattress
covers.
although,
holding
that
the
complaint
alleged
facts
constituting
a
deprivation
under
cover
of
state
authority
of
a
right
guaranteed
by
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
court
held
that
the
action
as
against
the
city
of
chicago
must
be
dismissed,
stating
and
i
quote
from
the
opinion,
"we
are
of
the
opinion
that
congress
did
not
undertake
to
bring
municipal
corporations
within
the
ambit
of
section
1983."
now
that
conclusion
was
rested
upon
a
reading
of
the
extensive
legislative
debate
that
ensued
in
1871
when
senator
sherman
of
ohio
introduced
an
amendment
to
the
post
civil
rights
act
of
1871,
but
significantly
not
an
amendment
to
the
section
1
now
1983,
but
rather
an
amendment
which
would
have
become
a
new
section
7
of
the
1871
act
and
that
amendment
would
have
made
the
inhabitance
of
the
county,
city
or
a
perish
in
which
certain
acts
of
violence
occurred
liable
to
pay
full
compensation
to
the
person
damaged,
or
his
widow
or
legal
representative.
that
amendment
failed
of
passage
and
this
court
in
monroe
v.
pape
inferred
from
that
failure
that
congress
feared
that
the
statute
might
be
unconstitutional,
if
applied
to
local
governments.
therefore
the
court
said
and
i
quote
again
from
monroe
and
pape,
"the
response
of
the
congress
to
the
proposal
to
make
municipalities
liable
for
certain
actions
being
brought
within
federal
preview
by
the
act
of
1871
was
so
antagonistic
that
we
cannot
believe
that
word
person
was
used
in
this
particular
act
to
include
them."
though
we
have
reexamined
the
debates
over
the
1871
act
and
are
satisfied
that
monroe
and
pape's
holding,
that
congress
excluded
municipalities
from
the
word
person
in
section
1,
now
section
1983
was
wrong.
our
opinion
includes
an
extensive
fresh
analysis
of
the
debates
in
stating
our
reasons
for
the
conclusion
that
monroe
and
pape
erred
in
that
prospect.
those
reasons
will
not
be
further
discussed
now.
it's
suffice
it
to
say
that
our
reexamination
brings
us
to
the
conclusion
that
congress
in
1871
would
not
have
thought
section
1
constitutionally
affirmed,
infirmed
that
it
applied
to
local
governments.
indeed,
the
history
rather
confirms
that
local
governments
were
intended
to
be
included
among
the
persons
to
which
1983
applies.
accordingly,
monroe
v.
pape
is
overruled
insofar
as
it
holds
that
local
governments
are
not
persons
within
the
term
every
person
in
section
1983.
local
governing
bodies
and
the
local
officials
sued
in
their
official
capacities
can,
therefore,
we
hold,
be
sued
directly
under
section
1983
for
monetary,
declaratory,
and
injunctive
relief
and
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
therefore
reversed.
but
our
opinion
goes
on
to
consider
what
must
be
proved
to
hold
local
governments
and
the
such
officials
liable.
first
we
hold
that
they
can
not
be
held
liable
on
a
respondeat
superior
theory,
that
is
be
held
liable
solely
because
the
local
government
body
employee
is
the
person
who
causes
the
plaintiff's
harm.
for
example,
a
person
injured
when
a
city's
trash
truck
driven
by
a
city
employee
on
a
city
business
runs
him
down,
even
intentionally,
doesn't
have
a
case
against
the
city
under
section
1983
merely
because
the
driver
was
a
city
employee.
we
hold
that
local
government
units
can
be
liable
under
the
section
1983
only
when
it
is
pleaded
and
proved
as
it
was
in
this
case,
that
the
action
alleged
to
be
unconstitutional,
implements
or
executes
a
policy
statement,
ordinance,
regulation
or
decision
officially
adopted
and
promulgated
by
that
unit's
officers.
however,
although
the
touchstone
of
this
section
1983
action
against
the
government
body
was
an
allegation
that
official
policy
is
responsible
for
a
deprivation
of
rights
protected
by
the
constitution.
the
local
governments
like
every
other
section
1983
person
by
the
very
terms
of
the
statute,
may
also
be
sued
for
constitutional
deprivations
visited
pursuant
to
governmental
"custom"
even
though
such
a
custom
has
not
received
formal
approval
through
the
body's
official
decision-making
channels.
congress
included
custom
and
usage
expressly,
in
section
1983
because
of
persistent
and
wide
spread
discriminatory
practices
of
state
officials,
practices
which
although
are
not
authorized
by
written
law,
could
well
be
be
so
permanent
and
well
settled
as
to
constitute
a
custom
or
usage
with
the
force
of
law.
and
i
should
also
emphasize
that
our
opinion
makes
clear
that
we
do
not
address
the
today
what
the
full
contours
of
municipal
liability
under
section
1983
may
be.
we
have
attempted
only
to
sketch
so
much
of
the
section
1983
cause
of
action
against
local
governments,
as
is
apparent
from
the
history
the
1871
act
and
our
prior
cases
and
we
expressly
leave
further
development
of
this
action
to
another
day.
for
example,
since
the
question
was
whether
the
local
government
bodies
should
be
afforded
some
force
of
official
--
some
form
rather
of
official
immunity
was
not
presented
as
a
question
to
be
decided
in
the
petition
in
this
case,
and
was
not
reached
by
the
parties
nor
addressed
by
the
courts
below,
we
express
no
views
on
the
scope
of
any
municipal
immunity
beyond
holding
that,
municipal
body
suit
under
section
1983
are
not
entitled
to
an
absolute
immunity
that's
necessarily
so,
unless
today's
decision
that
such
parties
are
subject
to
suit
under
section
1983
be
drained
of
meaning.
