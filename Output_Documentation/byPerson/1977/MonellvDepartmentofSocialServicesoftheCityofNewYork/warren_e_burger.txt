chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
1914,
monell
against
city
of
new
york.
mr.
chase
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
where
a
local
financially
or
where
a
local
board
bears
the
burden
of
a
school
desegregation
order
and
gets
a
grant
from
the
government,
the
order
could
be
perfectly
effective,
prospectively
through
individual
school
board
members
and
nonetheless
impose
the
burden
of
buying
buses
and
that
sort
of
thing
on
the
school
district
i
would
suppose.
is
not
it
that
language
of
congress
there
perfectly
reconcilable
with
that
interpretation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
at
one
o'clock
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
counsel,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
there
is
no
money
available,
let
us
assume
hypothetically,
for
some
legal
reasons,
could
others
be
compelled
to
enact
legislation
or
make
appropriations
or
raise
the
money
by
borrowing
it
in
order
to
pay
or
if
they
have
borrowing
power,
that
they
be
compelled
to
exercise
that
borrowing
power.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
do
not
you
think
the
courts
have
to
think
about
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
that
is
casting
it
somewhat
different
terms
from
my
inquiry.
if
you
were
talking
about
two
private
parties,
that
certainly
would
be
true,
the
courts
are
not
concerned
with
it.
we
are
talking
about
public
money
here
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
should
say
to
counsel
in
this
case
by
the
way
that
mr.
justice
brennan
is
inevitably
absent,
but
has
heard
part
of
the
arguments
and
will
participate
in
case
on
the
basis
of
the
tape
recordings
of
the
oral
arguments
and
of
course
all
the
records.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired
now
counsel.
mr.
sheridan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
before
you
leave
this
hypothetical,
justice
white's
hypothetical,
i
took
it
that
way,
does
that
have
some
elements
of
an
advisory
opinion
of
the
court
to
say
this
is
what
ought
to
be
done,
but
we
expressly
say
that
the
controller
does
not
have
to
pay
any
attention
to
it
and
the
individual
defendants
do
not
have
to
respond
in
the
money
judgment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
does
it
have
some
elements
of
an
advisory
opinion
of
the
court
or
how
would
you
characterize
it
other
than
being
wrong,
as
you
see
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
sheridan.
thank
you
gentleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
brennan.
