mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
thank
you!
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
these
cases
present
the
question
of
whether
foreign
governments
may
sue
for
treble-damages
under
our
antitrust
laws.
or
precisely
the
question
is,
did
congress
intend
to
include
the
sovereign
governments
of
foreign
nations
among
those
'persons'
for
whom
it
created
a
treble-damage
remedy
in
the
sherman
act?
there
are
three
cases
here
which
were
consolidated
for
appeal.
they
are
part
of
the
so-called
antibiotic
antitrust
litigation
which
at
one
time
consisted
of
upwards
of
160
damaged
cases.
the
plaintiff's
respondents
here
are
the
imperial
government
of
iran,
the
government
of
india,
the
republic
of
the
philippines.
the
principal
allegations
and
their
complaints
are
the
same.
each
of
them
alleges
the
defendant's
fixed
prices
and
otherwise
suppress
competition
in
the
manufacture
and
sale
of
certain
antibiotic
drugs
in
the
united
states
and
abroad.
each
of
them
alleges
that
it
purchased
antibiotics
which
were
exported
from
the
united
states.
each
of
them
alleges
that
it
sues
on
behalf
of
various
classes,
one
of
which
is
described
as
all
individual
consumers
within
their
respective
country.
and
finally,
each
of
them
alleges
that
it
is
an
independent
sovereign
nation.
the
issue
was
raised
in
the
district
court
on
motions
addressed
to
the
pleadings.
the
district
court
decided
that
foreign
nations
may
maintain
treble-damages
resting
its
decision
primarily
on
the
judge's
perception
that,
that
was
necessary
as
he
put
it
to
the
effective
enforcement
of
the
antitrust
laws.
his
decision
was
certified
for
immediate
appeal
on
a
panel
of
the
eight
circuit
affirmed.
the
panel
did
not
rest
its
decision
on
the
same
ground
that
district
court
had
but
instead
relied
principally
on
this
court's
decision
in
georgia
against
evans
holding
that
states
are
persons
for
treble-damage
purposes.
one
member
the
panel
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
he
observed
that
in
his
view
congress
had
no
intent
on
this
question
whatsoever.
he
thought
the
result
was
dictated
by
this
court's
georgia
against
evans
decision
but
he
recommended
that
congress
should
examine
the
question
and
clarify
it.
there
was
a
rehearing
en
banc
after
which
six
of
the
eight
active
judges
of
the
eighth
circuit
adopted
the
panel's
opinion.
three
of
those
six
also
adopting
the
concurring
opinion.
there
were
two
dissents,
the
dissenters
relied
on
the
court's
decision
the
united
states
against
cooper
in
which
it
was
held
that
the
united
states
is
not
a
person.
and
the
dissenters
observed
that
in
their
opinion
it
would
be
anomalous
to
hold
that
the
united
states
could
not
sue
for
treble-damages
but
a
foreign
sovereign
could.
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
neither
the
district
court
nor
the
court
of
appeals
made
an
independent
examination
of
the
legislative
history
and
instead
they
looked
entirely
to
this
court's
two
decisions
which
i
have
mentioned
for
guidance.
now,
if
the
court
please,
we
have
a
straight-forward
question
of
congressional
intent
here.
there
is
no
issue
in
this
case
about
whether
a
foreign
nation
may
sue
in
united
states
courts
if
it
has
a
proper
client.
of
course
it
can,
the
question
is,
did
these
foreign
nations
have
the
claim
they
pleaded?
and
that
in
turn
depends
upon
whether
congress
gave
it
to
them.
our
argument
begins
with
the
language
of
the
statute
which
confers
the
treble-damage
remedy
on
any
person
who
shall
be
injured
by
reason
of
a
violation
and
so
forth.
it
is
our
contention
that
language
just
read
in
its
ordinary
and
natural
sense
would
not
be
taken
to
include
sovereign
governments
and
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
three
decisions
by
this
court
in
which
the
court
made
a
similar
observation,
the
fox
case
in
1876,
the
cooper
case
itself
and
united
mine
workers
in
330
united
states.
now,
if
the
court
please
we
believe
that
there
is
evidence
here
developed
at
some
length
in
our
briefs
that
congress
in
1890
had
a
pretty
clear
understanding
of
the
term
'person'
and
a
pretty
clear
understanding
of
what
that
meant
and
did
not
mean.
one
point
that
we
rely
on
as
such
evidence
is
the
statute
of
1871
in
which
a
congress
says,
this
court's
prior
opinions
have
set
--
created
it's
own
dictionary
and
an
amendment
in
that
statute,
when
the
revised
statutes
of
1874
were
enacted.
the
1871
statute
had
defined
a
person
by
saying
that
it
may
extend
and
be
applied
to
bodies
politic
and
corporations
unless
the
context
indicates
a
more
limited
meaning.
when
the
revisers
of
the
statutes
submitted
their
report
to
congress
they
suggested
that
the
phrase
bodies
politic
be
deleted
on
the
ground
that
it
introduced
an
unnecessary
ambiguity
and
that,
with
that
ambiguity
it
might
be
thought
in
future
statutes
necessary
expressly
to
exclude
governmental
entities.
for
that
purpose
the
phrase
was
deleted
from
the
definitional
statute
when
it
was
reenacted
in
1874
so
that
it
read
then,
and
at
the
time
of
the
sherman
act
and
now
that
the
word
'person'
may
extend
and
be
applied
to
corporations
and
associations
unless
the
context
indicates
a
more
limited
meaning.
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
evidence
that
senators
who
were
the
principal
draftsmen
of
the
sherman
act
were
familiar
with
that
little
bit
of
legislative
history.
specifically
senators
edmunds
and
hore.
and
when
those
senators
wrote
their
definition
in
the
sherman
act
they
nailed
down
the
fact
that
person
must
include
corporation.
that
is
to
say
the
1874
statute
made
it
allowable,
person
may
extend,
but
in
section
8
of
the
sherman
act
that
is
written,
person
shall
be
deemed
to
include
corporations.
now
when
senator
edmunds
introduced
the
sherman
act
on
the
floor
of
the
senate,
he
said
that
the
legislation
is
clear
in
its
terms
and
definite
in
its
definitions.
the
definition
of
person
is
the
only
one
in
the
sherman
act,
and
we
submit
that
it
is
a
matter
of
logical
construction.
if
the
congress
in
the
light
of
the
change
and
the
definitional
statute
thought
it
necessary
expressly
to
include
corporations
which
might
have
been
included
as
a
matter
of
discretion
in
any
event.
it
must
follow
that
they
had
no
intention
whatever
to
include
sovereign
government.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
no,
justice
stevens
we
do
not
think
so.
the
terms
of
the
problem
we
are
discussing
we
submit
that
first
georgia
was
not
really
a
sovereign.
georgia
was
not
able
to
exercise
sovereignty
over
the
problem
it
was
faced
with.
a
combination
and
restraint
of
interstate
trade.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
no,
my
argument
justice
stevens
is
not
that
the
definitional
statutes
are
conclusive.
our
argument
is
that
they
are
very
weighty
evidence
of
what
congress
intended
and
that
should
take
a
fairly
clear
expression
of
congressional
purpose
to
read
a
government
into
that
word.
now
in
the
georgia
case
i
think
there
is
evidence
that
the
supreme
court
intended
to
include
georgia
and
the
other
states.
one
of
the
problems
that
congress
was
dealing
with
in
the
sherman
act
was
the
inability
of
states
to
reach
combinations
and
trust.
senator
sherman
used
as
an
example
to
illustrate
the
need
for
the
statute.
the
inability
of
the
state
of
new
york
to
reach
the
sugar
trust
because
if
members
were
beyond
then
territorial
jurisdiction
of
the
state
of
new
york
so
that
congress
had
very
much
in
mind
and
we
both
submit
--
intended
to
create
a
remedy
for
limited
state
jurisdiction
which
was
involved
in
the
georgia
case.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
no
sir,
i
do
not
believe
i
do,
and
i
do
not
see
any
reason
why
congress
had
it
thought
it
desirable
to
do
so,
or
if
it
should
think
it
is
desirable
to
do
so
now,
could
not
legislate
that
result.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
in
other
words,
if
other
countries
did
not
grant
the
same
right
to
the
united
states
then
we
could
deny
it
to
them.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
yes
sir.
it
seems
to
me
that
one
of
the
very
strong
points
in
our
position,
in
just
an
ordinary
practical
sort
of
way
is
it
simply
is
improbable
that
a
congress
which
intended
to
exclude
the
united
states
from
the
treble-damage
remedy
as
the
cooper
case
decided
that
did,
could
have
intended
to
give
that
remedy
to
a
foreign
sovereign
because
the
interest
of
the
united
states
government
are
closely
associated,
perhaps
indistinguishable
from
those
of
the
american
public
for
whose
protection
the
antitrust
laws
were
passed
whereas
the
interests
of
foreign
sovereigns
may
and
frequently
are
divergent
and
on
occasion
opposed
to
those
interests.
and
following
along
on
that
line
of
thought
it
seems
to
me
more
than
just
improbable
but
highly-unlikely
that
a
congress
with
that
sort
of
intention
might
have
intended
to
recruit
foreign
sovereigns
to
assist
in
the
enforcement
of
our
antitrust
laws
which
was
the
basis
for
the
district
court's
decision
and
as
i
read
it
is
essentially
the
argument
which
the
department
of
justice
has
made
in
it's
amici's
brief.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
exactly
sir.
the
speeches
of
congressmen
who
were
prominent
in
this
legislation
at
that
time
which
we
have
cited
in
our
briefs,
i
think
to
make
it
very
clear
that
what
they
were
interested
in
doing
was
protecting
domestic
consumers,
protecting
the
domestic
market
and
they
had
no
interest
whatever
in
protecting
foreign
governments.
in
short
if
the
court
please,
it
appears
to
us
that
there
is
ample
evidence
in
the
legislative
history
of
a
congressional
intent
not
to
make
the
treble-damage
remedy
available
to
foreign
nations,
whereas
it
seems
to
us
there
is
evidence
in
the
legislative
history
of
an
intent
to
make
it
available
to
state
governments.
now
the
decision
of
the
eighth
circuit
at
least
we
suggest
brings
about
a
peculiar
result.
peculiar
in
the
sense
that
it
gives,
for
example,
the
imperial
government
of
iran
a
right
to
sue
for
treble-damages
when
the
united
states
government
now
can
sue
only
for
actual
damages.
and
we
submit
that
an
intent
to
bring
about
that
result
or
not
being
imputed
to
congress
without
some
very
clear
and
strong
evidence,
but
that
is
what
it
intended
to
do.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
one
of
the
difficulties
with
the
eighth
circuit's
result
is
it
confers
the
remedy
on
a
foreign
nation
whether
it
is
friend
or
foe.
now
i
am
sure
that
reasons
could
be
thought
of
to
keep
the
government
of
north
vietnam
out
of
court
while
hostilities
were
going
on,
but
perhaps
not.
and
any
government
in
the
world
will
be
entitled
to
sue,
unless
the
eighth
circuit
is
reversed
and
we
ask
that
the
court
do
so.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
well,
indeed
your
honor
one
of
the
complications
we
had
in
this
litigation
was
one
of
the
original
foreign
government
plaintiffs
was
the
republic
of
vietnam,
and
in
the
midst
of
the
litigation
that
government
disappeared,
was
swallowed
up,
by
my
view,
by
north
vietnam
and
the
question
was
presented,
should
the
vietnam
case
be
dismissed
or
suspended?
there
was
counsel
in
court
for
vietnam,
whatever
vietnam
was
at
that
time
trying
to
keep
this
case
alive.
the
district
court
and
the
eighth
circuit
held
that
it
should
be
dismissed.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
well,
if
we
have
no
diplomatic
relations
at
all
mr.
chief
justice
it
may
be
that
our
courts
would
not
recognize
that
government
as
an
entity
which
would
be
entitled
to
sue.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
well,
quite
so,
sir.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
i
believe
so
justice
powell.
plaintiffs
allege
in
their
complaints,
each
of
the
plaintiffs
allege
in
its
complaint,
that
all
five
of
the
petitioning
companies
are
engaged
in
a
pharmaceutical
business
within
those
countries.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
yes
sir,
they
do.
we
have
cited
them
in
our
briefs.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
not
to
my
knowledge.
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
briefs
that
the
government
of
west
germany
which
has
filed
amicus
has
commenced
an
investigation
under
its
equivalent
of
the
antitrust
laws
against
one
of
the
petitioning
companies.
a
copy
of
that
letter
has
been
lodged
with
the
court.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
and
i
am
not
sufficiently
familiar
with
the
laws
of
those
countries
to
answer
the
question.
with
the
court's
permission
i
would
like
to
reserve
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
well,
it
is
our
position
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
right
for
foreign
governments
to
sue
here
is
already
established
so
that
there
would
be
no
necessity
for
such
a
treaty.
however,
we
have
entered
into
treaties
with
countries
such
as
west
germany
which
brought
their
treaty
to
your
attention
in
their
amicus
brief.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
if
the
eighth
circuit
opinion
is
affirmed
there
would
be
no
problem
in
the
congress
entering
into
additional
treaties
or
approving
additional
treaties
to
specify
the
mechanics
as
to
how
those
rights
might
be
gained
or
amplified.
indeed,
however,
our
state
department
through
the
secretary
has
appeared
as
we
note
in
our
brief
repeatedly
urging
other
countries
to
adopt
their
antitrust
principles.
and
one
of
the
points
we
would
make
is
that
it
is
simply
incomprehensible
that
we
could
go
urge
other
countries
to
adopt
our
philosophy
and
throw
them
out
of
our
own
courts
when
they
are
over
here
to
seek
redress
for
--
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
not
to
my
knowledge,
mr.
rehnquist.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
yes
it
is,
however
among
the
five
compelling
reasons
which
i
hope
to
cite.
we
do
come
to
the
point
that
congress
intended
foreign
governments
to
be
included
in
1890.
i
disagree
very
strongly
with
defendants
argument
that
that
was
not
the
intent
of
congress
in
1890.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
the
recent
conduct
of
the
attorney
general
surely
could
not
bear
on
the
intended
congress
in
1890.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
certainly
that
is
a
principle
premise.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
well,
principles
of
comity
plus
the
fact
that
not
only
where
these
rights
granted.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
alright.
with
respect
to
the
cooper
case
which
is
the
case
denying
those
rights
to
the
united
states
itself,
the
cooper
result
was
a
direct
and
a
deliberate
congressional
intent
not
to
extend
the
damage
remedy
to
the
united
states
and
that
deliberate
intent
was
explicitly
stated
by
senator
sherman
who
stated
that
the
damage
remedy
was
not
to
extend
to
the
united
states
at
all.
that
appears
on
page
24-61
and
again
on
24-63
of
21
congressional
record.
senator
sherman
was
(inaudible)
to
distinguish
between
the
first
section
of
his
bill
which
allowed
the
united
states
alternate
remedies,
criminal
remedies,
injunctive
remedies,
seizure
remedies,
and
he
said
that
these
remedies
were
made
available
for
the
us.
it
turned
upon
the
perceived
obligations
of
the
sovereign
to
enforce
its
own
laws
without
reference
to
the
added
stimulus
of
the
damage
remedy.
then,
having
distinguished
the
remedy
made
available
solely
to
the
us,
he
said
that
the
damage
remedy
was
to
be
made
available
to
all
other
parties
as
he
put
it,
so
that
the
cooper
result
is
a
direct
reflection
of
the
intent
of
the
sponsors
as
a
bill.
all
other
parties
were
to
have
the
benefit
of
the
bill.
moreover
the
treble-damage
remedy
has
been
extended
to
persons,
to
states,
to
foreign
corporations,
and
since
this
court
has
said
in
dunhill
nation
enters
this
country
in
a
commercial
capacity,
it
is
to
be
treated
the
same
as
every
other
traitor
subject
to
the
same
structures
of
the
marketplace;
subject
to
the
same
penalties
of
the
marketplace.
it
would
be
very
unfair
then
to
deny
in
any
remedy
when
there
are
multi-district
courts
set
in
georgia
by
a
violator
of
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
just
one
or
two
points.
these
plaintiffs
just
are
not
corporations.
they
can’t
get
under
the
statute
by
saying
that
they
plead
themselves
in
their
complaints
as
independent
sovereign
nations.
my
brother
referred
to
senator
sherman's
statement
that
the
united
states
would
be
excluded
from
the
treble
damage
remedy
as
evidence,
someone
expressed
congressional
intent.
in
making
that
statement
senator
sherman
was
referring
to
the
provision
and
his
then
draft,
which
limited
the
remedy
to
--
i
think
it
was
put
the
person
is
indemnified
or
injured.
there
was
never
in
any
of
senator
sherman's
address
any
express
exclusion
of
the
united
states,
other
than
as
may
be
implied
from
the
use
of
the
word
‘person’.
my
brother
misspoke
himself
twice
about
the
amendment
of
the
1871
statute
and
the
revisers
report.
the
language
he
referred
to
as
i
think
mr.
justice
rehnquist
suggested
was
from
a
revisers
report
recommending
that
the
phrase
bodies
politic
be
deleted
from
the
statute
so
that
in
future
statute's
it
would
not
be
necessary
to
exclude
them
expressly.
neither
the
cooper
case
nor
the
georgia
case
mentioned
the
1874
statute.
the
cooper
case
does
cite
the
case
of
united
states
against
fox
which
was
an
1876
decision
of
this
court
holding
that
the
united
states
was
not
a
person
within
the
meeting
of
the
new
york
statute
of
wills
and
stating
that
ordinarily
a
statue
employing
the
word
person
will
be
construed
to
exclude
the
sovereign.
our
friends
on
the
other
side
suggest
that
the
general
rule
in
1890
was
that
the
word
‘person’
includes
sovereigns.
we
just
flatly
disagree
with
that.
we
think
they
are
wrong
--
the
point
is
thoroughly
covered
in
the
briefs
and
i
would
not
repeat
myself.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
in
a
practical
sense
the
way
a
1890
congressmen
would
look
at
it,
i
am
sure
that
is
what
he
would
say,
he
could
think
of
all
kinds
of
reasons
why
georgia
ought
to
be
able
to
sue
and
iran
or
would
not.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
yes
sir
it
does
stand
for
that
proposition.
as
i
said
an
answer
to
justice
stevens’
question,
i
think
that
state
fits
our
analysis
for
two
reasons.
one
because
georgia
just
did
not
have
sovereign
power
--
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
in
this
area.
and
secondly
because
there
is
evidence
in
the
legislative
history
that
a
reason
for
the
sherman
act
was
the
limited
reach
of
state
law.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
i
think
they
clearly
do
justice
stewart.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
no,
no,
they
clearly
have
sovereign
power
to
deal
with
trade
restraining
combinations
which
affect
their
commerce.
either
in
terms
of
goods
imported
into
that
country
from
other
places
or
in
terms
of
activity
(voice
overlap).
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
under
their
own
laws.
and
i
say
that
a
foreign
sovereign
has
the
ability
to
deal
with
trade
restraining
combinations
affecting
their
commerce
to
the
same
extent
as
does
the
united
states
as
full
sovereign
power.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
not
under
our
antitrust
laws.
no
sir
of
course
not.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
yes
we
are
but
the
reason
i
feel
georgia
fits
into
our
analysis
is
because
georgia
under
its
laws,
was
powerless
to
reach
a
restraint
in
the
interstate
commerce
of
the
united
states.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
exactly,
exactly.
and
that
is
why
that
seems
to
us
to
be
just
all
a
difference
as
night
and
day
between
of
the
state
of
georgia
and
the
government
of
turkey.
thank
you.
