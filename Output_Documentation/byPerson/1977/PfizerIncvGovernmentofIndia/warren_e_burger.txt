chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
76-749
pfizer
incorporated
against
government
of
india
and
others.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
murphy
i
think
you
can
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
see
any
constitutional
objection
counsel
to
having
the
united
states
if
it
elected
to
enter
into
conventions
or
treaties
with
certain
countries
granting
them
the
rights
the
eighth
circuit
has
given
here,
granting
it
by
treaty
or
convention
either
on
a
reciprocal
basis
or
for
any
reason
the
executive
branch
and
the
congress
agreed
on?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
have
included
in
north
vietnam
during
the
recent
hostilities,
while
those
hostilities
were
ongoing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
nothing
would
have
prevented
the
north
vietnamese
from
hiring
american
lawyers
to
bring
such
a
lawsuit,
will
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words
a
suit
of
this
kind
is
not
barred
under
the
eighth
circuit
opinion
if
we
either
have
broken-off
diplomatic
relations
or
have
no
diplomatic
relations
for
any
reason,
they
can
still
sue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
recognition
and
the
government
as
such
and
the
presence
of
diplomatic
representatives
are
not
always
exactly
the
same.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
murphy.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
rigler.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
special
significance
to
your
use
of
the
adjective
friendly
--?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
but
cuba
could,
cuba
or
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
taiwan
could
bring
a
suit,
but
the
other,
china
could
not,
is
that
your
suggestion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
it
not
that
bring
the
courts
pretty
close
to
getting
involved
in
political
questions
of
the
highest
magnitude
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
to
make
decisions
of
that
kind?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
agree
mr.
murphy
that
united
states
could
enter
into
conventions
or
treaties
with
other
countries
granting
those
sovereigns
the
right
to
sue
for
treble-damages
if
we
have
the
same
right
in
their
courts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
would
be
nothing
to
prevent
the
congress
of
the
united
states
from
--
if
the
eighth
circuit
opinion
should
stand
nothing
to
prevent
the
congress
from
terrifying
it
so
that
right
to
sue
for
treble-damages
did
not
exist
and
then
do
you
see
any
problem
about
negotiating
treaties
or
conventions
of
its
reciprocity.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
policy
or
considerations
or
let
me
just
back
up
a
little,
of
necessity,
your
argument
must
be
that
congress
intended
this
result
that
the
eighth
circuit
reached.
i
take
it,
that
is
the
premise
of
your
whole
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
do
you
accept
that
they
did
not
grant
some
comparable
privileges
or
reciprocal
privileges
to
foreign
countries
at
that
time.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
most
countries
did
not
grant
this
comparable
privileges
and
remedies
to
our
country
because
it
was
somewhat
a
new
concept
at
that
time.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
were
any
of
those
involving
treble
damage
claims?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
remember
that
is
not
in
your
brief.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
your
time
has
expired
now
mr.
rigler.
mr.
murphy
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
does
not
foreign
sovereign,
whether
it
is
iran
or
turkey
have
certain
powers
which
the
state
of
georgia
or
california
does
not
have
namely
they
can
boycott
our
commerce
and
prevent
passage
and
do
great
many
political
things
which
under
our
commerce
clause
no
state
may
do
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
76-749
pfizer
against
the
government
of
india
and
others
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
stewart.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

you
mr.
justice
