justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
secretary
of
the
state
in
1890
was
not
wandering
around
the
world
urging
other
countries
to
adopt
the
sherman
act,
was
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
is
that
not
the
time
we
take
congressional
intent
as
of?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
how
does
the
conduct
of
the
attorney
general
in
recent
years
and
urging
other
countries
to
adopt
out
antitrust
principles
there
on
the
intended
congress
in
1890?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
policy
considerations
would
impel
the
congress
of
the
united
states
to
grant
to
foreign
--
other
sovereign
nations
rights
which
it
did
not
grant
to
the
united
states
itself?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
comity
is
usually
something
like
reciprocity,
is
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
is
no
reciprocity
in
my
hypothetical.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
with
foreign
corporations
though
at
least
that
they
are
wholly
owned
by
the
government,
this
is
a
two-way
street,
they
are
suable
as
well
as
capable
of
being
sued
under
your
analysis,
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
your
feeling
is
that
if
your
position
were
adopted
not
only
could
the
government
of
iran
sue
for
treble-damages,
but
it
could
be
sued
in
the
courts
of
this
country
for
treble-damages.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
have
not
yet
decided
whether
or
not
the
municipality
in
the
united
states
is
covered
by
the
antitrust
laws
defendant,
let
alone,
whether
or
not
a
foreign
nation
is.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
stanley
comment
on
the
sr1
the
definition
of
person
in
the
revised
statutes?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
why
wasn’t
that
the
draftsmen
complaint
about
the
existing
state
of
the
law
before
sr1,
rather
than
how
it
would
be
if
sr1
was
(voice
overlap).
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
of
course,
they
would
not
--
in
1875
there
have
been
substantively
changing
of
law
that
was
enacted
in
1980.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
if
senator
sherman
had
been
defeated
at
the
election
after
the
enactment
of
the
sherman
act
you
would
not
read
the
sherman
act
out
of
the
text,
would
you?
they
did
adopt
the
revised
statute,
congress
did
even
though
the
revisers
may
have
been
fired.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
maybe
that
is
an
argument
that
was
not
called
to
the
court's
attention
in
those
cases
and
perhaps
they
were
wrongly
decided.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
let
us
say
it
would
be
ironic
to
let
a
city
sue
and
not
by
the
states.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
there
cases
that
it
hold
that
a
foreign
government
could
sue
–-
you
are
just
relying
on
the
statutory
language
in
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
assume
we
agree
to
it
what
do
you
do
with
georgia,
you
said
it
will
just
confine
it
to
its
facts
and
say
a
state
is
a
state
and
a
foreign
government
is
a
foreign
government
(voice
