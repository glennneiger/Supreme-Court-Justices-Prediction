mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
at
least
five
compelling
reasons
for
including
the
congress
intended
foreign
governments
to
have
standing
to
obtain
relief
when
they
are
the
victims
of
antitrust
violations
launched
at
them
from
within
the
united
states.
conversely,
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
congress
intended
to
create
an
area
of
damaged-free
conspiracy
so
that
american
companies
could
prey
on
friendly
foreign
governments
engaged
in
making
purchases
to
satisfy
their
needs
in
this
country.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
no
there
is
not,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
turning
to
one
of
the
questions
that
was
just
raised,
it
is
our
view
that
without
diplomatic
relations
a
foreign
government's
right
to
enter
the
courts
of
this
country
would
be
governed
by
rules
of
comity
and
that
they
would
not
have
that
privilege
extended
to
them.
it
is
a
reciprocal
privilege
based
on
comity.
indeed
this
court
said
and
cuba
v.
sabbatino
--
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
that
is
my
suggestion
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
i
believe
the
test
would
be
very
simple,
that
is,
whether
or
not
we
had
diplomatic
relations
with
the
foreign
government.
i
do
not
believe
that
an
extensive
judicial
determination
would
be
required.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
i
am
not
sure
that
i
have
covered
them,
but
i
will
cover
them
briefly,
mr.
justice
stewart.
first
in
1890
congress
was
aware
of
the
prevailing
canon
in
general
rule
that
a
sovereign,
a
foreign
government
may
take
advantage
of
a
general
remedial
statute
whether
or
not
it
is
just
named
as
a
person
or
purposes
of
that
statute.
second,
in
georgia
v.
evans
this
court
recognized
that
governments
were
included
as
persons
within
the
meaning
of
the
sherman
act.
the
rationale
of
that
decision
that
these
governments
not
withstanding
their
sovereignty
within
their
own
territory,
within
their
own
area
of
sovereignty
might
have
their
own
antitrust
statutes,
nonetheless
they
would
be
denied
any
effective
relief
without
reference
to
the
federal
statute.
third,
in
both
cooper
and
in
georgia,
this
court
set
forth
five
aids
to
construction
with
reference
to
each
of
those
five
aids
we
satisfy
the
test
and
should
be
granted
standing.
fourth
and
normally
it
would
be
created
but
extending
the
right
to
foreign
corporations
which
are
100%
owned
by
foreign
governments
and
then
denying
that
same
standard
to
the
government
itself
in
making
its
direct
purchases.
we
know
coincidentally
that
this
would
favor
the
eastern
block
nations,
to
socialist
and
communist
block
nations
which
carry
out
more
of
their
trading
to
the
mechanism
of
the
state
trading
corporation
and
would
disfavor
our
traditional
western
allies
who
are
more
apt
to
purchase
directly.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
the
fifth
reason
i
was
about
to
come
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist
was
dunhill
which
i
have
mentioned
previously
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
government
itself
may
be
suable
as
you
put
it
under
the
principles
enunciated
in
dunhill.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
for
its
commercial
activities
i
believe
that
this
court
has
stated
that
rule
and
indeed
since
the
court
stated
that
rule
it
has
been
incorporated
in
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
i
heard
the
city
of
lafayette's
argument
if
it
is
that
to
which
you
refer
sir.
however,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
clear
that
a
foreign
government
is
subject
both
under
the
dunhill
rationale
and
rule
announced
by
this
court
and
under
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
that
for
its
commercial
activities
it
would
be
subject
to
our
law,
by
the
way
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
in
the
house
report
on
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
a
commercial
activity
is
defined
as
the
purchase
by
the
armed
services
of
a
foreign
government
of
goods
and
commodities
in
this
country,
and
of
course
some
of
the
varied
purchases
from
which
we
are
attempting
to
recover
our
purchases
of
medicines,
of
antibiotics
bought
for
the
armed
services
of
the
philippines
among
other
governments.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
there
is
mr.
justice
marshall.
in
responding
to
a
question
about
the
constitutional
foundation
of
his
bill,
senator
sherman
referred
to
article
iii
section
2
and
pointed
out
that
this
gave
the
federal
courts
wide
latitude
to
resolve
disputes,
and
then
he
enumerated
the
type
of
disputes
and
as
one
of
those
disputes
he
enumerated
disputes
between
citizens
of
this
country
and
the
foreign
nations.
and
it
seems
to
us
inconceivable
that
on
the
one
hand
he
would
say,
here
is
a
constitutional
basis
from
our
bill,
this
among
others,
and
yet
turn
around
and
say
but
they
are
not
to
receive
the
benefits
of
a
damage
remedy.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
no,
he
did
not
as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
he
did
not
say
specifically
foreign
governments,
however,
he
referred,
he
did
not
--
senator
sherman
did
not
referred
to
the
protection
of
the
american
people
as
opposed
to
the
exclusion
of
foreign
interest.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
i
do
not
know.
he
did
not.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
he
said
that
he
was
trying
to
make
effective
pre-existing
remedies
both
common
law
and
state
remedies
on
page
21
congressional
record
24-60,
he
gave
a
speech
which
outlined
his
philosophy
of
the
bill,
and
his
philosophy
was
that
the
individual
remedies
then
existing
for
antitrust
defenses
simply
were
ineffective
to
control
the
trusts.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
no
sir,
because
he
went
on
to
say
that
he
referred
to
the
foreign
commerce
of
the
united
states
--
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
no,
absolutely
not
right.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
respectfully
urge
you
to
return
to
the
reference
at
24-60
--
24-56
because
repeatedly
he
referred
to
foreign
commerce
of
the
united
states
in
addition
to
which
the
bill
itself
not
only
mentions
foreign
commerce
but
as
the
eighth
circuit
noted
trade
and
commerce
with
the
foreign
nations
found
its
way
into
the
statutory
language
and
it
seems
to
us
that
while
respondents
argue
we
were
not
concerned.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
it
did
say
foreign
corporations
by
the
way.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
probably
because
--
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
it
said,
persons
include.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
well,
surely
governments
were
meant
to
be
included
in
persons.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
but
this
court
said
that
state
governments
were
and
this
court
has
recognized
the
right
of
municipal
government.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
but
that
is
because
senator
sherman
specifically
excluded
in
the
legislative
history,
specifically
indicated
why
the
united
states
government
was
to
be
excluded.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
for
purposes
of
the
rationale
in
this
court's
decision
in
georgia
v.
evans
i
certainly
do.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
no,
because
the
usual
rule,
that
is
the
point
i
want
to
make,
the
usual
rule
in
1890
was
that
sovereigns
are
included
and
this
court
said
so
in
1893
a
contemporary
case.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
included
in
the
term,
persons,
whether
or
not
if
the
definition
said
persons
and
persons
may
include
natural
persons
and
corporations.
if
the
statute
said
nothing
more
and
it
is
a
remedial
statute
then
foreign
governments,
sovereigns
are
entitled
to
the
benefits
of
that
statute
and
that
is
exactly
what
this
court
said
in
stanly
v.
schwalby.
and
i
might
point
out
that
in
that
instance
it
was
the
united
states
which
was
taking
advantage
of
the
remedy
and
the
united
states
was
a
foreign
sovereign
because
stanley
v.
schwalby
was
a
case
under
texas
law
and
this
court
said,
although
not
mentioned
by
name
in
a
remedial
statute
it
does
refer
to
persons
generally,
the
united
states
may
take
advantage
of
it.
and
that
rule
was
announced
only
three
years
different
from
the
passage
of
the
sherman
act.
and
we
have
referred
to
the
treatises
and
to
the
authorities
specifically
black
on
statutory
interpretation,
the
1896
edition,
which
repeated
that
role.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
no
it
did
not.
the
revised
statute
it
is,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
we
do
not
believe
support
the
argument
of
the
petitioners
here
for
several
reasons.
number
one,
this
court
could
not
have
reached
it's
result
in
georgia
if
the
defendants
were
correct
in
their
argument
about
their
applicability
nor
could
this
court
have
reached
the
result
it
did
in
us
v.
california
rising
under
the
shipping
act
to
us
v.
nardone
under
the
communications
act
because
they
all
used
‘persons’
an
in
approximately
in
the
same
sense
as
it
was
done
in
the
sherman
act.
secondly
if
you
take
the
language,
the
very
language
upon
which
the
petitioner's
purport
to
rely,
the
fair
and
ordinary
reading
indicates
that
congress
specifically
would
have
had
to
include
governments
in
order
to
read
them
out
of
the
statute.
let
me
read
exactly
what
the
reviser
said.
it
requires
that
the
draftsmen
in
the
majority
of
cases
of
employing
the
word
‘person’
to
take
care
that
states,
territories,
foreign
governments,
etcetera,
appear
to
be
excluded.
but
that
is
not
what
senator
sherman
and
the
other
sponsors
of
the
bill
did.
they
took
no
care
to
see
that
they
were
excluded.
they
wrote
a
definition
that
was
inclusive.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
i
do
not
believe
that
that’s
a
fair
reading
of
the
statement.
moreover
the
draftsmen
were
not
to
make
any
substantive
change
in
the
laws,
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
were
in
essence
fired
and
congress,
there
was
a
great
deal
of
legislative
history
than
to
the
effect
that
no
substantive
change
was
intended.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
no,
no,
but
they
would
have
been
tampering
with
the
general
rule
that
the
sovereign
may
avail
himself
of
a
general
remedial
statute.
even
though,
the
sovereign
not
be
expressly
mentioned
as
a
person.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
it
is
certainly
that
is
the
question.
it
would
be
directed
narrowest
question
before
court.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
well
it
does
in
terms
of
what
congress
would
have
thought
in
1890
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
yes
but
although
that
definition
did
not
mentioned
government
says
such,
we
have
seen
that
the
municipal
governments
may
avail
themselves
as
a
provision
to
the
sherman
act.
state
governments
may,
and
like
that
we
have
no
effective
remedy
except
with
reference.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
some
are,
some
are
not.
in
the
chattanooga
case,
atlanta
did
turn
out
to
be
a
corporation.
i
did
not
read
that
as
the
turning
point
to
the
case
however.
let
me
comment
on
another
argument
raised
by
the
petitioners.
namely,
that
in
1890
no
damage
rights
existed.
remember
that
sherman's
intent
was
to
consolidate
the
pre-existing
remedies
under
the
common
law
and
under
state
statutes
in
order
to
make
them
effective.
well
as
long
ago,
1623
in
the
english
statute
of
monopolies,
the
remedy
of
treble
damages
had
been
extended
and
if
you
consult
that
statute
you
will
see
that
among
the
people
to
whom
that
was
extended
was
bodies
politic,
i.e.,
governments.
in
1890
no
less
than
13
states
already
had
antitrust
statutes
on
their
books,
some
of
which
provided
for
damages,
kansas
being
an
example.
third
--
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
not
to
my
knowledge
mr.
justice
--
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
i
understand,
no
sir.
however,
you
read
that
again
sherman's
intent,
which
was
to
incorporate
the
general
pre-existing
rules
and
bashing
them
into
a
single
federal
statute
so
that
trust
could
be
eliminated
and
so
that
antitrust
principles
would
be
enhanced.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
well
if
you
would
consult
his
references
they
are
not
to
the
direct
legislative
history
of
the
sherman
act.
they
are
such
things
as
speeches
before
the
whole
--
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
but
consult
to
references
that
i
gave
mr.
justice
marshall,
where
sherman
is
talking
specifically
of
foreign
commerce
and
the
words
‘foreign
corporations’
how
could
you
accommodate
on
the
one
hand.
congress’s
extension
of
the
remedy
explicitly
to
foreign
corporations
with
a
desire
to
read
foreigners
out
of
the
remedial
provisions
of
the
antitrust
law.
it
simply
can
not
be
done.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
true
they
did
not
grant
--
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
well
plainly
though,
the
remedy
of
treble
damages
was
extended
to
foreign
corporations
whether
or
not
us
corporations
could
obtained
comparable
rights
really
is
of
no
moment
because
right
there
in
the
statute,
the
question
was
why
do
we
assume
that
congress
did
not
want
to
read
out
foreign
interest
altogether?
and
the
answer
is,
because
they
specifically
included
some
foreign
interest
namely
foreign
corporations
in
the
--
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
it
could
have
been
the
either
way
mr.
justice
marshall,
somewhere
quite
obviously
but
the
statute
would
not
raise
that
distinction.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
no
indeed.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
that
a
state
is
sovereign.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
well
actually
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
do
argue
that,
although
i
do
not
think
that
the
argument
was
(voice
overlap)
i
agree
with
that
prophecies.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
yes
sir.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
absolutely.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
either
way.
i
think
that
even
if
they
were
not
a
corporation
they
would
be
a
person
but
--
yes
they
are
a
corporation
and
so
on
that
account
as
well
they
are
person.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
from
the
face
of
the
act,
no
sir.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
not
on
the
face
of
the
act
but
it
--
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
if
the
act
said
“person's
injured
in
their
business
and
property
may
recover”,
foreign
governments
would
be
included.
if
the
act
said
“corporations
injured
in
their
business
and
property”
foreign
nations
would
be
included.
so
either
way
foreign
nations
would
be
included.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
but
that
was
the
prevailing
rule
at
that
time,
contrary
to
the
fox
case
which
the
respondents
took
side
of.
the
general
rule
which
was
stated
in
1889
in
republic
of
honduras
v.
soto
was
that
sovereign's
were
persons
availing
themselves
a
remedial
statute.
that
was
said
--
there
it
was
said
in
republic
of
mexico
v.
arangoiz
in
1856
cases
bracketing
the
fox
decision.
and
it
was
said
again
in
stanley
v.
schwalby.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
no
sir,
however
there
was
a
treble
damage
case
returning
to
my
point
that
sherman
intended
to
consolidate
the
common
law
remedies
in
1887
in
new
york.
and
since
this
argument
first
was
raised
in
the
reply
brief
we
have
not
had
a
chance
to
address
that.
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
buffalo
lubrication.
the
standard
oil,
the
part
of
the
standard
oil
trust,
in
1887
new
york
case,
106
new
york
669,
holding
that
damages
were
an
available
common
law
remedy.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
that
is
not
in
our
brief
because
the
argument
was
not
raised
until
the
reply
brief
--
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
it
is
not
relevant
for
several
reasons
first
because
the
revisers
were
not
entrusted
with
the
task
of
making
any
substantive
change
in
the
law.
second
because
the
revisers
in
essence
were
fired.
third,
even
if
you
take
the
reviser's
language,
fairly
read,
it
supports
the
concept
that
you
had
to
specifically
exclude
a
sovereign
as
a
person
for
the
sovereign
would
be
included.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
well
that
is
certainly
what
the
language
says.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
they
did
not
intend
to
make
any
change
in
the
substantive
rule
and
the
remainder
of
my
answer
to
mr.
justice
white
is
that
this
court
simply
could
not
have
come
out
where
it
did
in
georgia
v.
evans
or
in
us
v.
california
or
in
us
v.
nardone
or
the
other
cases
we
cite,
if
the
defendant’s
version
or
the
1874
revision
were
correct.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
it
is
my
recollection
that
the
1874
decision
was
called
to
the
court's
attention
either
in
cooper
or
georgia.
i
would
have
to
check
that
but
i
believe
that
too
have
been
the
case
from
our
review
of
the
briefs.
mr.
murphy
mentioned
one
other
case
by
the
way
which
is
--
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
no
it
was
assumed
that
(voice
overlap)
municipality
had
standing.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
no
evans
may
have
recognized
it
but
they
did
--
i
do
not
believe
that
that
was
the
basic
rationale
of
the
decision
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
it
did
not
dispute
it;
yes
in
that
sense
it
relied
on
it.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
yes
correct.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
yes
sir.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
because
the
statute
indicated
that
the
remedy
was
available
to
bodies
politic.
i
believe
that
appears
in
the
text
of
the
statute
itself.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
treble
damages
were
specifically
mentioned.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
for
violating
the
statute.
and
i
now
believe
that
one
of
the
provisions,
one
of
the
wrongs
covered
by
the
statute
was
the
illegal
assertion
of
a
patent
monopoly,
which
of
course
is
one
of
the
allegations
in
the
very
case
before
us
here.
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
on
the
statute
of
monopoly
sir?
mr.
douglas
v.
rigler
yes
sir.
i
wanted
to
address
the
united
mine
worker's
case
which
the
respondents
say
disputes
the
proposition
that
sovereigns
may
avail
themselves
of
the
language
in
a
general
remedial
statute.
united
mine
workers
stands
on
a
different
proposition
namely
the
sovereign's
may
not
be
stripped
of
preexisting
sovereign
as
opposed
to
commercial
prerogatives.
in
the
event
of
the
subsequent
statute
is
passed.
i
mentioned
among
my
points
the
anomaly
it
seems
just
inconceivable
to
conclude
that
on
the
purchases
of
identical
goods,
to
say
aircraft
on
the
one
hand,
quite
written,
could
not
recover
for
purchases
by
the
royal
air
force
whereas
british
airways
a
wholly
owned
government
corporation
could.
