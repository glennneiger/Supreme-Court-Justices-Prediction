justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
in
1890
that
mentioned
foreign
government?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
that
senator
sherman
said
other
than
i
want
to
protect
american
people,
did
not
he
said
it
over-and-over
again?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
said
he
will
protect
the
foreign
governments?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
did
not
say
that.
did
he
say
he
will
protect
the
american
people.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
did
he
say
he
was
protecting?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
was
talking
about
american
people.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
was
taking
advantage
of
the
people.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
he
was.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
did
not
the
statute
say
persons
and
foreign
governments?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
did
not
it
say,
persons
and
foreign
governments?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
said,
persons.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
when
it
said,
persons,
that
included
corporations,
because
this
court
had
already
said
that
corporation
were
included
in
the
word
'persons'
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
so
corporations
were
meant
to
be
included,
but
i
do
not
know
who
else
was
meant
to
be
included
in
persons.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
this
court
said
the
us
government
was
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
said
us
government
was
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
do
you
say
to
the
argument
that
your
brother
makes
that
in
1890
there
was
a
generalized
atmosphere
of
xenophobia
or
something
that
came
to
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
generalized
atmosphere
of
probalism
(ph)
if
you
will.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
could
have
been
that
then
as
if
now
this
lot
of
real
“foreign
corporations”
bounded
by
americans?
