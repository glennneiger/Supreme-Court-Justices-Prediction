well
it
certainly
was
not
there
in
the
justice
homes
case.
there
was
no
issue
raised
about
whether
a
municipal
corporation
is
a
person.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
evans
relied
on
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
did
not
said,
i
said
that
relied
on
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
rigler
could
i
ask
you
one
question
about
your
argument
that
i
did
not
quite
follow.
you
made
references
of
the
statute
of
monopolies.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
a
precedent
to
the
effect
that
foreign
governments
could
sue
for
damages
under
that
statute?
i
thought
that
statute
basically
is
a
prohibition
against
grants
to
monopolies
by
the
crown.
how
did
the
damage
remedy
figure
in
that
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
remedy
could
have
been
under
that
statute
that
is
what
i
--
justice
byron
r.
white
for
doing
what?
