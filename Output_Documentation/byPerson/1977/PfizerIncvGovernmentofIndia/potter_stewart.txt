justice
potter
stewart
mr.
rigler,
you
start
up
by
telling
us
that
there
are
at
least
five
compelling
reasons
why
your
possession
is
correct,
and
i
am
sure
by
our
interrogation
we
have
gotten
you
to
--
you
have
probably
given
us
all
the
reasons
but
not
in
one,
two,
three,
four,
five
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
really
that
basic
general
rule
that
the
federal
court's
of
this
country
are
opened
to
sovereign
nations
as
plaintiff.
so
if
they
state
a
cause
of
action
then
it
is
not
directly
applicable
here.
this
is
different
and
somewhat
a
narrower
question,
that
is,
what
is
the
word
‘person’
in
the
sherman
act
inclusive
of
foreign
sovereign
governments.
that
is
the
question
is
not
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
general
rule
is
interesting
but
really
does
not
bear
on
that
question.
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
a
definition
of
the
word
‘person’
that
is
what
is
said
here
in
a
particular
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
municipal
governments
are
corporations.
justice
potter
stewart
and
did
any
of
them
explicitly
provide
that
a
foreign
nation
could
seek
redress?
justice
potter
stewart
any
of
the
state
statutes
is
what
i
mean?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
india
or
even
iran
do
not
have
sovereign
power
to
do
anything
about
illegal
antitrust
activity
in
the
united
states
unless
they
can
be
plaintiffs.
they
do
not
have
sovereign
power
to
do
it.
justice
potter
stewart
to
enforce
the
antitrust
laws
in
the
united
states?
justice
potter
stewart
in
my
sense
you
were
talking
about
the
inability
or
the
powerlessness
of
a
state
such
as
georgia
or
any
other
state
to
enforce
the
agreements
in
restraint
of
trade
and
other
violations
of
the
antitrust
laws
in
the
united
states.
justice
potter
stewart
hardly,
you
do
not
really
mean
that.
they
can
not
bring
criminal
prosecutions
and
go
to
the
antitrust
laws.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
we
are
talking
about
our
antitrust
laws.
justice
potter
stewart
this
case
is
here
by
way
of
grant
of
certiorari
to
review
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eight
circuit.
we
are
asked
in
this
case
to
decide
whether
a
foreign
nation
is
entitled
to
sue
in
our
courts
for
treble
damages
under
the
anti-trust
laws.
the
respondents
are
the
government
of
india,
the
imperial
government
of
iran,
and
the
republic
of
the
philippines.
they
brought
separate
actions
in
federal
district
court
against
the
petitioners,
who
are
six
pharmaceutical
manufacturing
companies.
their
complaints
alleged
that
the
petitioners
had
conspired
to
restrain
and
monopolize
interstate
and
foreign
trade
in
the
manufacture,
distribution,
and
sale
of
so
called
broad
spectrum
antibiotics,
in
violation
of
sections
1
and
2
of
the
sherman
act.
each
respondent
claimed
that,
as
a
purchaser
of
antibiotics,
it
had
been
damaged
in
its
business
or
property
by
the
alleged
anti-trust
violations,
and
each
sought
treble
damages
under
section
4
of
the
clayton
act.
the
petitioners
asserted
as
an
affirmative
defense
to
the
complaints,
that
the
respondents
as
foreign
nations
were
not
"persons"
entitled
to
sue
for
treble
damages
under
section
4.
in
response
to
pretrial
motions,
the
district
court
held
that
the
respondents
were
"persons,"
and
refused
to
dismiss
the
actions.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
affirmed,
and
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
an
important
and
novel
question
in
the
administration
of
the
anti-trust
laws.
for
the
reasons
set
out
in
some
detail
in
the
written
opinion
of
court
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
hold
that
a
foreign
nation
otherwise
entitled
to
sue
in
our
courts
is
entitled
to
sue
for
treble
damages
under
the
anti-trust
laws
to
the
same
extent
as
any
other
plaintiff.
neither
the
fact
that
the
respondents
are
foreign
nor
the
fact
that
they
are
sovereign
is
reason
to
deny
them
the
remedy
of
treble
damages
congress
afforded
to
"any
person"
victimized
by
violations
of
the
anti-trust
laws.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
that
mr.
justice
powell
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
have
joined.
and
mr.
justice
powell
has
filed
a
separate
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
justice
blackmun
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
