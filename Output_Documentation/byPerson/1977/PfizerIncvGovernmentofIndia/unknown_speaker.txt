unknown

well,
do
you
equate
--
i
was
going
to
say
texas,
but
let
us
make
it
california.
do
you
equate
california
whether
as
a
sovereign
in
the
sense
of
yugoslavia
or
--?
unknown
speaker
but
then
to
pursue
mr.
justice
marshall's
inquiry
why
would
the
congress
pinpoint
foreign
corporations
as
being
included,
and
almost
clearly
exclude
any
others.
was
that
not
exclude
under
the
usual
rules
of
construction?
unknown
speaker
included
in
the
term,
foreign
corporations?
unknown
speaker
that
is
true
well
you
have
to
argue,
i
guess,
that
a
state
is
a
corporation?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
argue
on?
unknown
speaker
i
know
but
how
it
is
a
person?
unknown
speaker
you
say
a
foreign
government
is
a
person
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
unknown
speaker
and
why
is
it
a
person?
certainly
is
not
by
any
common
ordinary
definition
of
word
person.
you
suppose
that
corporation
has
been
included
if
they
had
never
put
the
definitional
section
in,
they
have
just
used
the
word
person?
is
it
a
foreign
statement?
unknown
speaker
well
is
that
your
argument
that
you
have
to
--
you
go
directly
from
person
to
foreign
state
or
do
you
go
through
corporation?
unknown
speaker
and
you
think
that
is
just
so
clear
from
the
face
of
the
act
and
did
not
(voice
overlap)
unknown
speaker
what?
do
you
say
it
is
or
not?
unknown
speaker
on
the
face
of
the
act
of
(voice
overlap)
was
the
act,
the
words
of
the
act
you
would
no
include
the
foreign
state,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
so
you
need
(voice
overlap)
from
just
the
face
of
the
act
you
think?
unknown
speaker
could
you
tell
me
again
why
the
revised
statute,
statutory,
the
usual
rule
or
the
rule
stated
in
the
revised
statutes
about
defining
persons.
why,
that
is
not
relevant
here?
unknown
speaker
on
the
face
of
the
provision?
unknown
speaker
but
certainly
that
case
does.
at
least
stand
for
the
proposition
that
the
word
person
can
include
a
quasi
sovereign
state.
unknown
speaker
in
this
area?
