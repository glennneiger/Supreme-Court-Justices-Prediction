mr.
william
l.
skinner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
statutory
scheme
of
the
adoption
laws
of
the
state
of
georgia.
the
statutory
scheme
of
adoption
laws
of
the
state
of
georgia,
that
presently
exist,
and
of
course
it
should
be
noted
that
this
is
going
to
change,
effective
january
01,
1978
provide
that,
an
adoption
may
be
had
of
a
man
or
child
with
only
the
consent
of
the
mother
where
the
child
is
illegitimate.
this
is
contrary
to
the
first
paragraph
of
statute
concerning
consent,
which
says
that
an
adoption
can
only
be
had
with
the
consent
of
all
living
parents.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
i
am
referring
to
the
old
statute
which
has
a
--
mr.
william
l.
skinner
the
old
statute
does
start
off
with
a
provision
that
no
adoption
can
be
had
of
man
or
children
without
the
concern
of
living
parents,
it
goes
on
then
to
state
exceptions.
one
of
the
exceptions
is,
the
challenged
statute
here
which
is
that
the
consent
of
a
mother
alone
will
suffice
if
the
child
is
illegitimate.
this
of
course
has
been
interpreted
by
the
georgia
supreme
court
in
smith
v.
smith
to
mean
that
the
father
must
petition
to
legitimate
the
child,
prior
to
the
filing
of
any
adoption
action
or
he
loses
the
right
to
legitimate
the
child,
that
was
applied
in
this
case.
it
was
clearly
applied
because
in
this
case
mr.
quilloin
had
not
filed
a
petition
to
legitimate
the
child
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
adoption.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
yes,
sir.
he
filed
it
as
what
i
would
consider
defensive
measures
to
the
adoption
proceedings.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
i
do
not
think
that
that
was
a
specific
holding
of
the
trial
court.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
that
is,
but
i
think
that
that
was
based
upon
the
conclusions
of
law
that
mr.
quilloin
had
no
standing
based
upon
the
challenged
statutes
which
only
give
standings
to
object
to
adoption
to
the
legal
father,
that
is
the
father
who
has
married
the
mother
or
has
legitimated
the
child
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
adoption
action.
i
would
like
to
point
out
in
that
regard
that
in
this
case,
the
appellees
married
each
other
in
1967,
darrell
then
that
come
to
live
with
the
appellees
until
1969.
the
adoption
action
was
not
filed
until
1976,
i
see
no
real
distinction
in
saying
that
the
legitimation
action
is
late
when
the
adoption
action
is
not.
the
adoption
action
in
my
opinion
was
filed
purely
and
simply
to
eliminate
mr.
quilloin’s
rights
under
the
adoption
statute
of
the
state
of
georgia
because
i
believe
that
the
record
is
quite
clear
that
apparently
ms.
walcott
had
contacted
counsel
and
had
been
advised
at
that
point
in
time
that
mr.
quilloin
had
no
rights.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
i
think,
i
addressed
that
issue
in
my
brief
as
mush
as
i
could.
that
is
true
the
georgia
statute
is
concerning
birth
certificates
provide
that
the
father
of
illegitimate
child
should
not
appear
on
the
birth
certificate
nor
or
shall,
the
child
had
his
name,
unless
he
consents
to
this.
it
is
apparent
from
the
record
that
darrell
webster
quilloin
has
always
been
darrell
webster
quilloin
and
not
darrell
webster
williams
which
is
the
maiden
name
of
ms.
walcott,
so
he
had
in
fact
signed
the
birth
certificate.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
i
think
that
he
was
--
that
it
is
somewhat
disputed
in
the
record
as
justice
blackmun
would
note.
he
was
with
the
maternal
grandparents
part
of
time,
the
paternal
grand
parents
part
of
the
time
and
with
the
appellate
mr.
quilloin
part
of
the
time.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
no,
sir.
and
let
me
point
this
out
too
in
that
regard
darrell
has
never
been
a
deprived
child.
this
is
not
a
case
involving
what
the
some
people
would
stereotype
type
an
illegitimate
child.
darrell
has
been
loved
and
cared
for
by
maternal
and
paternal
grand
parents,
by
the
mother,
by
the
father
and
even
though
it
may
be
somewhat
contrary
to
our
position,
apparently,
the
step-father
cares
for
darrell,
but
the
step-father
did
not
file
a
petition
to
adopt
darrell
until
he
had
been
married
to
the
mother
for
nine
years.
he
could
have
filed
immediately.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
under
smith
v.
smith,
i
think
that
he
could
not
fail
to
deny
the
legitimation
because
it
was
filed
prior
to
the
adoption.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
it
is
applied
to
state
law
yes.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
i
do
not
know.
other
than
the
fact
that
he
interpreted
stanley
to
mean
that
he
had
to
give
mr.
quilloin
a
hearing,
of
course,
at
the
conclusion
of
the
hearing,
he
held
that
he
had
no
standing
which
to
me
was
quite
puzzling.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
that
is
true
and
it
changes
the
name.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
no.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
i
think
that
it
could
be
interpreted
as
that
way.
i
do
not
think
there
is
specific
reason
to
it.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
no,
the
statute
only
provides
that
in
the
event
that
the
child
is
legitimated
under
that
statute,
he
can
inherit
from
the
father
not
bring
to
father.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
no,
none
that
i
know
of.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
georgia,
georgia
supreme.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
yes.
no,
i
know
of
no
case
where
that
has
been
held.
it
has
factually
been
held
against
me
where
i
present
--
mr.
william
l.
skinner
because
i
was
using
that
as
in
my
opinion
a
defensive
tactic
also
to
course
the
new
adoption
statutes
which
is
effective
january
01,
provides
that
this
must
be
filed,
that
you
must
file
a
legitimation
to
protect
yourself.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
your
honor,
at
page
24
of
the
appellee’s
brief
i
think
the
appellee
admits
that
this
would
amount
to
the
right
of
a
grant
in
substance,
i
grant
to
mr.
quilloin,
the
right
to
be
taken
it
out.
the
new
adoption
statute
gives
it
like,
so
--
mr.
william
l.
skinner
sir,
--
mr.
william
l.
skinner
yes,
because
of
the
time
sequence,
yes
and
of
course
i
tried
to
point
out
in
my
brief
that
the
state
of
georgia
was
in
the
process
of
passing
the
new
adoption
statute,
while
this
case
was
in
actual
litigation,
actual
trial
and
i
feel
that
is
clearly
now
or
will
be
on
january
01,
1978.
the
public
policy
of
the
state
of
georgia
to
give
fathers
of
a
illegitimate
children,
the
right
to
legitimate
the
children
after
the
filing
of
the
adoption
and
therefore
have
standing
to
object
to
the
adoption.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
no.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
right,
and
of
course
that
is
all
that
we
are
requesting
in
this
case.
we
are
not
requesting
custody.
the
--
mr.
william
l.
skinner
very
much
so.
we
consider
mr.
quilloin
or
i
consider
him
as
a
defective
divorced
father.
he
was
never
married
to
the
biological
mother
of
course,
but
he
has
acted
as
if
he
had
been
married
to
her
and
divorced.
he
is
seeing
the
child
as
at
the
child
visit
with
him.
he
has
paid
money
for
the
child.
he
has
directly
indirectly,
he
has
provided
gifts
for
the
child.
he
has
done
everything
as
far
as
a
nurturing
instinct
is
concerned
that
a
normal
divorced
father
would,
and
i
feel
like
that
he
should
probably
be
treated
like
that.
i
do
not
think,
any
court
would
say
that
merely
because
a
divorce
has
been
granted,the
father
of
the
child
should
be
eliminated
from
the
picture,
unless
he
is
unfit
and
that
could
be
done
--
mr.
william
l.
skinner
no,
sir.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
no,
sir.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
yes.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
not
fully.
in
the
sense
that
part
of
the
support
came
from
the
mother,
part
of
the
support
came
from
the
maternal
and
paternal
grand
parents.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
that
is
true.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
well,
i
think
he
testified
that
he
had
sent
the
child
--
mr.
william
l.
skinner
i
think
that
is
the
fact
as
to
what
he
said.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
let
me
try
to
support
that
with
the
law
if
i
may
,
in
georgia
there
is
a
presumption
that
a
parent
is
fit
and
that
there
is
in
fact
a
presumption
that
parent
has
not
abandoned
the
child
and
therefore
the
party
that
has
to
burden
of
proof
must
proceed
and
i
feel
that
if
there
was
enough
evidence
to
constitute
abandonment,
we
would
not
be
here
today
that
the
trial
court
could
simply
help
that
he
had
abandoned
the
child,
all
that
he
was
unfit
and
the
trial
court
would
not
then
have
had
to
reach
the
constitutional
issue.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
then
i
think
that
he
would
be
in
a
position
to
have
his
rights
severed
by
adoption
or
by
a
juvenile
court
proceeding
to
terminate
his
rights.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
but
that
is
not
the
case
here.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
no,
sir.
i
think
the
total
act
support
with
the
matter
of
abandonment.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
yes.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
he
would
not
be
deprived
of
the
custody
then
because
he
would
be
doing
the
best
he
could
and
i
think
that
the
no
court
would
ever
requires
somebody
to
do
more
than
they
would
be
able
to
do.
in
that
situation
--
mr.
william
l.
skinner
well,
the
fact
is
of
course
in
this
case,
is
step-father
and
the
biological
mother,
is
providing
for
darrell
in
some
degree.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
no,
sir.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
no,
sir.
there
is
a
way
of
course,
justice
white.
of
course
the
step-father
can
make
a
will
leaving
his
entire
estate
if
he
so
desires
and
of
course
--
mr.
william
l.
skinner
no,
sir.
it
would
not.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
that
is
true,
so
could
mr.
quilloin,
but
in
this
case
of
course
under
trimble
v.
gordon,
it
matters
not
to
darrell.
in
this
particular
situation
now.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
i
think
the
person
that
provides
50%
to
support
could.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
of
course
that
would
be
a
split
proposition.
i
do
not
how
irs
would
rule
on
that,
but
if
one
provided
51%,
if
mr.
quilloin
provided
51%
of
darrell’s
support
he
could
claim
not,
yes.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
no,
sir.
the
record
is
of
course
somewhat
ambiguous
about
the
manner
of
support
that
was
involved.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
well,
that
was
the
finding
of
the
trial
court.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
to
some
extent,
i
think
you
can,
but
i
think
that
the
record
should
be
looked
at
as
a
whole.
there
was
no
finding
of
abandonment
as
i
was
pointing
out,
of
course
georgia
has
held
that
the
failure
of
one
parent
to
support
a
child
where
support
is
neither
requested
or
needed
is
not
an
abandonment,
so
there
was
no
abandonment
on
mr.
quilloin,
that
is
pretty
clear
rule,
a
rule
involved
of
law
in
georgia
that
came
out
of
a
case
involving
the
custody
of
an
illegitimate
child
where
the
mother
had
lost
custody.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
no,
but
i
contend
that
that
is
not
necessary.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
no.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
right
irregularly
so.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
i
would
say
that
this
does
not
--
mr.
william
l.
skinner
i
have
not
briefed
that
issue
other
than
i
can
now
quote
--
mr.
william
l.
skinner
right.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
right.
i
think
it
is
patterfield
versus
mont
(ph)
it
is
a
georgia
supreme
court
case
that
held
that
for
parent
to
lose
his
right
to
custody
of
a
child
that
child
must
be
abandoned.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
i
think
that
you
are
bound
by
the
findings
of
fact
to
some
extent
yes.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
it
is
smith
v.
smith.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
which
is
224
georgia
442.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
yes
sir.
162
south
eastern,
second
379,
thank
you.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
yes,
i
do.
our
client
and
he
does
have
that
right.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
to
do
that,
he
would
have
to
take
as
it
above.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
sir
--
mr.
william
l.
skinner
only
in
the
form
of
visitation
rights.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
in
georgia
it
is
as
a
part
of
custody
that
is
a
status
by
writ
of
habeas
corpus
says
if
a
change
of
custody.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
that
is
true.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
if
the
mother
was
found
unfit,
but
we
do
not
contend
that
the
mother
was
unfit.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
on
occasions
yes.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
with
the
paternal
grand
parents,
ms
dalson(ph).
mr.
william
l.
skinner
no,
but
i
think
that
that
directly
showed
the
parties
mr.
quilloin
and
his
mother
were
living
together
at
that
time.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
my
ultimate
objective
is
for
him
to
have
some
visitation
rights
with
the
child
which
he
had
up
until
very
recently
before
this
--
mr.
william
l.
skinner
sir
--
mr.
william
l.
skinner
absolutely
not.
absolutely
not
because
he
has
not
seen
the
child
of
course
since
filing
of
this
adoption
action,
and
the
records
are
quite
clear
that
the
purpose
of
filing
of
this
adoption
action
was
not
the
purpose
stated,
purpose
of
filing
of
this
adoption
action
was
to
get
rid
of
mr.
quilloin
out
of
the
life
of
this
family,
of
course,
they
did
not
file
this
adoption
because
mr.
quilloin
had
abandoned
the
child.
they
file
this
adoption
because
they
were
concerned
of
the
overbalance
of
things
that
was
being
received
by
darrell
from
mr.
quilloin
as
opposed
to
their
seven
year
old
biological
child
of
the
appellees.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
he
was
not
requested
or
needed
at
that
point
in
time.
as
far
as
the
home
was
concerned,
as
far
as,
right
in
here
that
this
court
held
in
trimble
v.
gordon
that
he
had
that
anyway
there
was
no
question
of
paternity
of
the
man
or
child,
the
question
in
this
case.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
i
do
not
think
he
did.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
no,
he
has
never
had
custody.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
well,
i
contend
your
honor,
quite
may
be
to
the
contrary
my
own
self
that
yes,
he
could
abandon
the
child
because
a
divorced
father,
in
my
opinion
could
abandon
a
child.
and
i
think
that
he
should
be
treated
as
divorced
father,
i
think
he
is
father.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
we
would
not
be
here
now.
i
think
that
--
mr.
william
l.
skinner
oh,
yes.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
i
think
he
would
have
the
standing
to
object
to
the
adoption.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
i
think
they
would
have
to
make
a
finding
of
total
abandonment
that
he
just
left
the
child
without
necessities.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
begin
by
trying
to
answer
justice
white’s
question
which
i
understood
to
be,
what
would
be
the
result
if
--
mr.
william
l.
skinner
no,
sir.
i
am
not
trying
to
give
you
georgia
case.
what
would
be
the
result
if
mr.
quilloin
had
married
the
mother
and
then
divorced?
was
that
i
think
that
i
understood
your
honor’s
question
to
be
that.
he
would
have
an
absolute
right
to
veto
the
adoption
had
that
been
the
case
because
the
georgia
adoption
statute
as
exists
now,
provides
that
the
failure
of
a
divorced
father
to
support
by
period
of
12
months,
if
he
was
ordered
to
do
so
by
a
superior
court
order
would
do
away
with
the
necessity
of
his
consent.
there
is
not
showing
of
that
in
this
case.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
i
think
not.
i
think
that
he
took
the
child
to
the
doctor,
to
the
hospital,
paid
the
bill,
sent
the
child
to
kindergarten.
i
think
that
he
has
shown
various
substantial
interests.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
yeah,
of
course
under
trimble
v.
gordon,
is
it
not
necessary.
he
had
recognized
the
child
as
his.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
i
am
sure
that
he
did.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
i
am
sure
he
did.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
well,
the
mother
had
failed
to
provide
the
necessities
for
the
child,
yes.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
i
think
that
they
could
show
an
abandonment
in
fact
that
yes.
that
the
father
would
have
lost
his
rights
under
those
facts,
but
that
is
a
“total
payment
failure
to
pay
support”
cannot
be
an
abandonment,
but
let
me
point
out
a
particular
case
in
georgia
which
i
did
not
point
out
in
my
brief
and
that
is
patterford
versus
mont
(ph)
230
georgia
at
692
and
particularly
at
694
which
held.
this
court
has
many
times
held
under
facts
similar
to
those
in
the
instant
case
that
the
mere
failure
of
a
parent
to
provide
support
for
a
man
or
child
when
in
the
possession
or
custody
of
the
other
parent.
a
grant
parent
or
other
person
when
no
support
is
requested
or
needed
is
not
such
a
failure
to
reward
necessaries
or
such
an
abandonment
as
will
amount
to
a
relinquishment
of
the
right
to
parental
custody
and
control
and
i
think
that
perhaps
this
would
answer
justice
marshall’s
concerning
abandonment
of
two
in
this
issue.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
i
think
not
under
this
ruling,
but
that
is
not
the
case
in
this
case.
this
man
had.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
under
georgia
law
it
would
not
be
an
abandonment
considered
in
patterford
versus
mont
(ph).
mr.
william
l.
skinner
i
do
not
think
that
the
enforcement
of
the
law
would
be
there.
no,
i
think
that
having
not
shown
an
interest
it
would
be
discretionary
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
he
sent
the
child
to
kindergarten
when
he
was
five
years
old
actually
took
him
himself.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
kept
the
child
himself
and
paid
--
mr.
william
l.
skinner
there
is
a
question
about
whether
it
was
him
or
someone
in
his
employ.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
but
let
me
point
this
out
too.
under
the
present
georgia
adoption
scheme,
it
would
not
have
mattered
whether
he
had
given
the
child
a
million
dollars
a
day,
if
he
had
not
legitimated
the
child
he
would
have
no
stands.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
he
is
willing
to
pay.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
to
the
contrary
the
record
is
quite
clear
that
--
mr.
william
l.
skinner
yes,
he
wants
to
veto.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
he
would
be
one
of
the
ones,
and
mother
would
had
a
responsibility.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
no,
your
honor.
the
record
is
clear.
he
told
the
court
i
am
ready,
but
am
unable
to
pay
the
money
i
will
pay
the
money,
all
he
got
to
do
is
tell
me
how
much
to
pay?
where
to
pay?
and
when
to
pay?
now,
well,
of
course
he
has
voluntarily
done
things.
of
course
that
is
not
really
the
issue
in
this
case
anyway
because
no
support
was
ever
requested
and
there
was
no
finding
of
abandonment
in
this
case.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
he
never
was
requested
in
this
case,
but
--
mr.
william
l.
skinner
yes,
yes.
i
think
mr.
quilloin
has
that
feeling.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
and
he
has
expressed
--
mr.
william
l.
skinner
i
think
it
is
substantially
considering
all
the
fathers.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
the
record
is
not
clear
on
that.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
sir.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
but
the
court
did
not
find
abandonment.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
that
is
true.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
that
is
true
and
--
mr.
william
l.
skinner
i
think
that
they
are.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
but
it
was
applied
in
this
case.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
it
was
applied
in
this
case.
i
would
like
to
reserve
whatever
time
i
may
have
for
rebuttal.
mr.
william
l.
skinner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
record
is
quite
clear.
darrell
said,
he
wanted
to
continue
visiting
with
mr.
quilloin.
that
is
terribly
important
in
this
case
and
it
is
quite
clear
in
the
appendix
that
he
said
that
also
if
mr.
--
mr.
william
l.
skinner
that
is
absolutely
true.
these
are
good
people.
they
are
all
good
people.
i
have
very
difficult
time
saying
that
the
walcotts
are
not
good
people.
they
do
not
have
that
much
trouble
saying
that
mr.
quilloin
is
not
good.
i
think
that
mr.
quilloin
has
performed
admirably
in
this
case
and
he
will
continue
to
perform.
he
actually
told
the
court
that
he
wants
to
support
the
child.
he
is
willing
to
accept
whatever
court
ordered.
support
of
the
child.
he
is
willing
to
tender
it
voluntarily
and
for
this
reason
i
do
not
think
that
he
should
be
treated
any
differently
from
the
divorced
father.
in
answer
to
the
court’s
question
to
mr.
jones,
there
is
no
question
if
the
adoption
the
big
rock
question
in
this
case
is
-
can
the
adoption
be
completed?
once
the
adoption
was
completed
all
the
other
matters
became
immaterial
because
he
had
no
issue.
he
had
no
rights.
