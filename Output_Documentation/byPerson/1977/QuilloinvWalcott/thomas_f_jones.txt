mr.
thomas
f.
jones
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
appellant
is
here
because
he
contends
that
the
adoption
of
his
child
without
his
consent,
violates
his
due
process
rights.
we
contend
that
this
position
is
untenable
in
view
of
the
existence
of
georgia
code
section
74-103,
which
provides
that
the
father
of
an
illegitimate
child
can
legitimate
that
child
at
any
time.
once
this
child
is
legitimated
he
is
legitimate
for
all
purposes
including
inheritance,
including
the
objection
to
adoption
and
perhaps
most
important
--
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
yes,
this
is
our
position
your
honor.
since
appellant
did
not
take
this
step
and
did
not
legitimate
the
child
he
should
not
be
heard
to
argue
that
he
has
been
denied
due
process.
he
had
an
opportunity
for
this
due
process
for
11
years
and
did
not
choose
to
do
it.
as
i
stated
previously
when
the
child
is
illegitimate
the
father’s
consent
is
not
required
and
georgia
code
section
74-403
states
that
if
the
child
is
illegitimate,
only
the
mother’s
consent
is
necessary.
appellant
has
also
contended
that
there
is
an
equal
protection
violation
here,
because
he
says
as
georgia
law
burdens
all
(inaudible)
fathers.
our
position
is
that
this
is
not
the
case.
there
are
two
classes
involved
here
-
fathers
of
legitimate
children
and
fathers
of
illegitimate
children.
appellant
is
in
the
second
class
because
of
his
own
choice.
he
could
have
investigated
the
situation,
gotten
an
attorney
and
found
out
exactly
what
his
rights
were
and
what
he
needed
to
do
to
protect
them.
now,
there
is
a
distinction
made
between
these
two
classes,
but
we
would
submit
that
this
distinction
is
made
based
only
a
valid
state
interest,
that
state
interest
is
georgia’s
interest
in
the
welfare
of
its
children
and
georgia’s
interest
in
the
protection,
and
stability
of
the
family
unit.
in
that
connection
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
request
that
the
court
considered
the
effect
of
a
decision
in
appellant’s
favor
and
how
it
would
effect
adoptions
all
over
the
country.
if
fathers
of
illegitimate
children,
if
their
consent
was
required
many
adoptions
which
should
take
place,
would
not
take
place.
there
would
be
problems
of
locating
the
father,
there
would
be
problems
of
the
father
just
not
consenting
and
there
would
also
be
the
potential
problem
of
profit
seeking
in
order
to
obtain
an
adoption.
we
submit
that
the
most
important
factor
here
is
the
best
interest
of
a
child.
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
i
believe
that
this
is
--
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
i
agree
totally
mr.
chief
justice
and
this
relates
to
the
problems
i
was
speaking
of
a
little
bit
ago,
if
states
had
the
burden
of
number
1
-
determining
who
these
fathers
are
and
then
locating
them
so
that
their
consent
could
be
obtained
before
any
adoption
of
an
illegitimate
child
could
take
place.
many
deserving
children
will
not
get
the
home
environment
that
they
deserve.
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
no,
that
is
not
true
in
this
case.
in
this
case,
the
georgia
has
a
policy
which
i
believe
reflect
this
court’s
decision
in
stanley
v.
illinois.
the
georgia
department
of
family
and
children
services
makes
every
effort
to
locate
fathers
of
illegitimate
children
in
these
circumstances.
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
he
did
admit
it.
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
no,
no
it
is
not
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
yes,
they
are
your
honor.
a
report
is
submitted
from
this
department
to
the
superior
court
judge
on
all
petitions
for
adoptions
in
georgia.
this
report
contains
the
department’s
recommendations
concerning
the
best
interest
of
the
child.
as
i
have
stated
previously,
the
courts
of
georgia
and
the
legislature
of
georgia
have
stated
that
this
adoption
is
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child,
the
father
has
not
provided
any
significant
support
for
this
child
for
12
years.
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
well,
i
would
answer
in
this
way
your
honor.
that
may
be
somewhere
of
a
father
who
deserves
consideration.
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
your
honor
i
would
think
the
only
father
who
is
deserving
of
consideration
is
one
who
has
done
all
he
can
to
legitimate
or
to
acknowledge
that
child.
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
i
would
say
this
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
interests
of
the
child
are
more
important
and
in
effect
to
a
situation
such
as
this.
i
would
defend
that
broader
part.
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
yes,
it
is.
i
would
also
like
to
refer
the
court
to
page
67
of
the
appendix
in
this
case
which
--
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
your
honor,
that
is
or
that
may
be
i
should
say
that
was
my
initial
reading
of
that
statute.
in
that
connection
i
would
like
to
refer
the
court
to
page
23
of
appellees’
brief
in
which
the
relevant
enforcement
of
a
new
section
is
stated.
this
is
the
new
section
74-405
which
will
become
effective
on
january
01,
of
the
next
year.
this
section
states
that
the
surrender
or
termination
of
parental
rights
by
consent
or
otherwise,
shall
not
be
required
as
a
pre-requisite
in
the
case
of
a
parent
who
has
failed
significantly
without
justifiable
cause
for
a
period
of
one
year
or
longer,
immediately
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
petition
for
adoption
number
1
-
to
communicate
or
to
make
a
bona
fide
attempt
to
communicate
with
the
child
and
number
2
-
to
provide
for
the
care
and
support
of
the
child
as
it
required
by
a
law
or
judicial
decree.
it
is
uncontested
in
this
case
that
appellant
has
never
supported
the
child.
he
is
required
to
do
so
by
section
74-202
of
georgia
code,
which
requires
that
the
father
of
an
illegitimate
child
is
required
to
support
that
child
therefore
i
see
a
potential
question
of
fact
here,
and
georgia
court
might
have
to
decide
where
he
has
failed
significantly
without
a
justifiable
cause.
these
words
of
qualifications
as
i
say
may
raise
a
question
of
fact,
but
i
would
still
hold
to
my
initial
impression
that
there
is
a
very
good
chance
that
this
adoption
will
not
take
place
if
it
is
decided
under
the
new
law,
which
becomes
effective
january
01.
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
this
is
my
initial
impression
as
i
say
a
question
of
fact
may
arise
under
the
section
i
just
stated.
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
but
that
was
a
qualification
your
honor,
whether
he
has
significantly
and
without
justiciable
cause.
the
courts
of
georgia
might
take
the
position
although
i
think
it
would
be
untenable
they
might
take
the
position
that
where
someone
else
was
carrying
for
the
child
that
was
not
necessary
for
them
to
support.
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
i
would
have
to
agree
with
that
your
honor,
but
we
contend
that
this
case
should
be
decided
under
the
present
statute
for
two
reasons,
number
1-
the
present
statute
adequately
protects
the
rights
of
appellant
of
his
due
process
and
equal
protection
rights.
secondly
it
would
be
a
manifesting
justice
in
the
strongest
sense
of
the
word
to
apply
an
adoption
statute
to
a
case,
to
a
new
adoption
statute
which
becomes
effective
for
the
21
months
after
the
original
filing
of
the
petition
for
adoption.
i
think
that
is
adequate
authority
in
the
cases
of
this
court
to
allow
you
to
decide
under
the
present
statute.
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
yes.
as
i
was
saying
before
--
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
that
is
correct
your
honor,
but
--
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
that
was
correct
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
that
is
correct
your
honor,
but
he
--
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
he
did
that
is
correct
your
honor
and
then
--
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
this
is
correct.
findings
of
fact
number
15
and
16.
number
15
says
the
proposed
adoption
of
the
child
by
appellee
is
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child
and
the
proposed
legitimation
in
habeas
corpus
is
not
in
the
best
interest
of
a
child,
so
even
though
he
decided
based
on
the
statutory
scheme
which
we
have
been
discussing,
he
has
we
might
say
left
the
door
open
and
found
in
accordance
with
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
this
case.
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
your
honor,
that
is
a
very
interesting
question
and
one
that
has
troubled
me
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
is
other
litigation
based
on
news
reports
of
this,
but
i
would
like
to
refer
the
court
to
as
i
say
the
most
important
thing
here
is
the
best
interest
of
the
child.
darrell
himself
has
stated
that
he
wants
to
be
adopted
as
a
matter
of
fact
when
i
put
that
question
to
him
he
says
i
want
my
name
changed.
this
is
perhaps
the
most
important
thing
to
the
child.
only
he
can
understand
the
stigma
of
having
to
go
through,
like
his
last
name
different
from
--
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
your
honor,
i
would
have
to
be
frank
and
say
that
i
would
hope,
a
decision
would
be
based
on
the
present
statute.
this
is
solely
on
the
statute
that
appellees
relied
on
21
months
ago.
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
your
honor,
that
position
is
taken
in
the
brief
after
further
analysis
since
submission
of
the
brief,
i
have
concluded
that
there
might
possibly
be
that
question
of
law
which
i
referred
to
earlier
based
on
--
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
yes,
it
does
your
honor.
it
really
does,
but
as
i
say
darrell
himself
is
the
one
who
has
to
bear
the
stigma
of
having
the
different
last
name
from
his
other
family
members.
we
would
submit
that
the
child
should
not
have
to
go
through
like
bearing
this
burden
to
protect
the
rights
of
a
person
who
has
shown
his
lack
of
concern
for
the
child.
he
has
not
supported
the
child.
he
is
attempting
to
block
the
adoption
of
the
child
when
i
think
it
is
obvious
then
this
adoption
is
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child.
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
your
honor
this
is
another
--
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
your
honor,
appellant
has
made
the
argument
that
his
notice
of
appeal
to
this
court
acted
as
a
supercedious
and
there
is
no
final
judgment
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
the
statute
is
effective
as
of
january
01,
1978.
the
only
possibility
of
this
case
being
decided
under
the
new
statute
would
be
this
court’s
general
policy
of
deciding
cases
under
the
law
as
it
exists
at
the
time
of
decision.
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
i
would
assume
so
your
honor.
i
would
frankly
love
to
see
the
court
follow
what
i
think
to
be
adequate
authority
in
the
bradley
case
and
in
the
green
versus
macevoy
case
which
states
that
where
a
“manifest
in
justice”
would
result
from
applying
a
new
statute
and
that
statute
should
not
be
applied.
i
think
this
is
a
classic
example
of
a
manifesting
justice
where
a
petition
--
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
your
honor
the
order
which
is
listed
which
is
given
in
the
appendix
has
been
entered.
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
this
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
well,
your
honor
i
have
sort
of
put
a
section
in
my
brief
in
anticipation
of
a
possible
ruling
by
this
court.
i
am
very
much
afraid
that
this
court
may
be
tempted
to
remand
this
case
to
georgia,
but
i
would
prefer
and
i
think
that
that
--
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
well,
i
think
that
is
correct,
but
i
think
this
court
has
controlled
over
its
own
decision
and
would
have
the
authority
to
uphold
this
adoption
even
if
the
decision
is
made
after
january
01,
based
on
the
bradley
and
green
line
of
cases.
appellant
in
this
case
wants
the
best
of
both
words,
he
wants
the
immortality
of
you
can
call
that
that
of
having
a
son
with
his
name,
but
at
the
same
time
he
does
not
want
to
satisfy
the
obligations
that
are
attended
with
this
relationship.
he
wants
to
have
his
cake
and
eat
it
too.
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
that
is
the
only
statement
that
i
have
been
able
to
find.
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
well,
i
would
have
to
agree
with
the
court
but
i
would
still
state
that
this
court
has
adequate
authority
to
uphold
this
adoption
as
a
stand
even
if
the
court
reaches
its
decision
after
january
01.
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
the
adoption
order
has
been
entered.
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
as
i
say
my
opponent
has
made
the
argument
that
there
has
been
a
stay.
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
this
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
taking
of
an
appeal
does
act
as
a
supercedious.
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
this
is
correct.
the
child
himself
has
been
called
by
the
name
of
walcott,
the
adopted
name
ever
since
the
decision
of
this
case.
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
he
is
still
living
with
the
walcotts
as
he
has
for
the
last
seven
years.
the
child
began
using
that
name
after
the
order
of
adoption
was
entered,
but
before
my
opponent
filed
his
appeal.
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
i
would
agree
i
believe
that
the
court
would
have
had
the
authority
to
allow
visitation
rights,
but
the
court
found
that
these
rights
would
not
be
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child.
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
your
honor
under
the
new
statute
i
believe
the
primary
emphasis
is
on
the
adoption
as
a
whole.
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
our
position
would
be
that
no
it
does
not
matter.
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
your
honor
my
analysis
of
the
statute
does
not
reveal
any
statement
regarding
visitation
rights
if
an
adoption
is
granted
either
under
the
old
or
the
new
statute.
since
all
domestic
relations
actions
involved
the
equity
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
my
initial
reaction
would
be
that
the
court
certainly
would
have
the
jurisdiction
and
do
anything
if
thought
appropriate.
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
no,
no
i
do
not
think
that
would
have
to
allow
visitation
rights.
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
i
am
not
sure
that
they
could.
i
have
found
in
my
analysis
that
their
statute
does
not.
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
my
reaction
to
that
would
be
that
the
judge
in
view
of
the
lack
of
definiteness
in
this
whole
situation
wanted
to
keep
himself
covered
and
rule
on
all
of
the
facts.
he
has
stated
his
conclusion
that
he
thinks
that
any
visitation
rights
are
not
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child.
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
this
is
correct
your
honor.
this
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
this
is
not
done.
i
may
have
misunderstood
mr.
justice
powell’s
question
in
certain
statements
that
i
made.
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
this
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
i
would
agree
completely
your
honor
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
your
honor,
the
divorce
situation
is
very
different
from
the
situation
that
we
have
here
above.
in
a
divorce
situation
the
child
is
legitimate.
he
starts
as
that
--
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
well,
your
honor
my
reaction
to
that
would
be
that
if
the
natural
father
contested
the
adoption
then
it
would
never
take
place
in
the
first
place,
so
the
second
--
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
i
am
not
aware
of
any
authority
on
that
proposition.
i
would
request
an
opportunity
to
look
for
some
for
the
court.
mr.
thomas
f.
jones
your
honor
as
i
have
stated
this
appellant
wants
the
best
of
both
words.
he
does
not
want
to
assume
the
responsibility.
he
does
not
contest
that
the
child
is
in
a
loving
family
environment,
he
only
wants
to
keep
the
child
from
losing
his
name
and
i
would
just
like
to
conclude
by
saying
that
he
should
not
have
that
right
in
derogation
of
the
rights
of
the
child
which
is
the
most
important
thing
involved
in
this
case.
thank
you.
