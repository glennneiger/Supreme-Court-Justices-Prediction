justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
clear
he
does
not
give
51%?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
mr.
skinner
is
there
any
finding
of
non
abandonment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
finding
is
that
he
did
not
give
the
child
support.
justice
thurgood
marshall
except
irregularly.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
was
said
we
are
bound
by
that
finding?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
give
me
a
case
that
says
will
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
skinner
you
said
he
did
not
abandonment
of
child?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
can
he
abandon
some
he
never
had?
he
never
had
custody,
did
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
how
could
he
abandon
something
he
never
had?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
parent
of
the
child
who
gives
nothing
for
a
period
years
and
long
period
of
years
can
suddenly
appear
and
take
over
the
child,
is
that
the
georgia
law?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
only
thing
this
man
has
done
is
what
the
court
found,
that
regularly
he
bought
toys
and
paid
for
medical,
not
one
word
in
there,
about
food,
not
one
word
about
shelter
and
that
gives
him
some
kind
of
rights
of
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
had
he
kept
the
child?
justice
thurgood
marshall
everyday
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah,
he
may
--?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
he
wants
to
do
it,
to
decide
who
will
pay
the
money?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
does
not
pay
the
money,
but
he
wanted
to
see
to
decide
who
will
pay?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
wants
a
veto
who,
the
guardian
shall
be?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
would
not
the
guardian
be
the
one
to
pay
the
money?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
he
wants
the
right,
he
does
not
pay
the
money,
so
he
wants
the
right
to
decide
who
will
pay
the
money?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
not
a
father
have
to
be
requested
to
pay
for
his
children?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah,
but
does
he
not
normally
have
a
feeling
that
he
wants
to
support
his
own
child?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
how
much
efforts
did
he
put
in.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
much?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
really
with
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
so.
justice
thurgood
marshall
finding
of
a
court
is
that
he
irregularly
did
look?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
that
is
not
true
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
this
case
i
thought
he
admitted
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
on
the
record,
so
it
is
not
in
this
case
at
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
not
your
fault,
but
would
it
not
be
“to
the
best
interest
of
the
child”
not
to
have
the
public
litigation
all
over
the
life?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
quilloin
has
visitation
rights
to
mr.
walcott?
child
belongs
to
somebody
else
is
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
did
somebody
get
visitation
rights
to
my
child
and
that
i
do
not
understand?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
georgia.
at
issue
is
the
constitutionality
of
georgia's
adoption
laws
as
applied
to
deny
an
unwed
father
authority
to
lead
to
adoption
of
his
illegitimate
child.
under
georgia
law
child
born
out
of
wedlock
can
be
adopted
with
the
consent
of
the
mother
alone,
unless
the
father
has
legitimated
the
child.
in
this
case
the
appellant,
the
unwed
father
of
the
illegitimate
child
who
had
been
in
the
custody
of
its
mother
since
birth,
objected
to
the
doctrine
of
child
by
the
mother's
husband
and
sought
legitimation
and
formal
visitation
rights
at
that
time.
after
full
hearing
of
which
appellants
were
allowed
to
present
evidence,
all
matters
included
to
fitness
as
a
parent,
the
trial
court
granted
the
adoption
and
denied
legitimation
and
visitation
rights
on
the
ground
that
the
outcome
was
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child.
the
judge
of
supreme
court
affirmed.
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
we
hold
that
the
georgia
statute
as
applied
in
this
case,
did
not
deprive
appellant,
a
due
process
or
a
equal
protection,
a
power
to
the
substantive
rights
under
the
due
process
clause,
was
certified
by
the
application
of
the
best
interest
of
the
child
and
that
standard
following
the
evidentiary
hearing,
appellant
solely
protection
claimed
that
the
state
was
required
to
treat
him
the
same
as
a
divorced
father
as
without
marriage.
since
appellant
never
shouldered
any
significant
responsibility
for
the
child.
according
to
the
judgment
of
supreme
court
of
georgia
is
affirmed.
