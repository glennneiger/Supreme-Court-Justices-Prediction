unknown
speaker
where
was
darrel
for
that
interval
between
the
marriage
of
the
walcotts
and
the
time
he
entered
their
home?
unknown
speaker
he
was
not
under
state
custody,
was
he?
unknown
speaker
mr.
skinner
on
this
question
of
timing,
is
it
not
correct
that
before
the
trial
judge
entered
his
order
allowing
the
adoption
and
denying
the
petition
to
legitimate
that
he
would,
if
he
had
concluded
that
there
would
have
been
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child
to
go
with
the
natural
father.
he
could
then
have
legitimated
the
child?
unknown
speaker
you
think
that
is
a
matter
of
law?
unknown
speaker
as
a
matter
--
well,
then
why
did
he
not
deny
at
the
outset
of
the
proceeding
i
wonder?
unknown
speaker
what
would
have
been
the
consequences
of
legitimation?
i
thought
it
does
do
more
than
in
title
1
to
inherit?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
does
it
do
more
or
not?
unknown
speaker
so
it
does
not
entitle
a
person
to
veto
an
adoption?
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
what
the
statute
says,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
has
there
ever
been
a
holding
in
a
kentucky
courts
that
legitimation
entitles
the
natural
father
to
veto
an
adoption?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
whatever
court
where
we
are
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
georgia
supreme.
unknown
speaker
that
was
not
an
issue
in
this
case
that
why
was
a
trial
judge
asked
to
legitimate,
if
it
did
not
bear
on
the
adoption?
unknown
speaker
mr.
skinner,
as
a
practical
proposition,
this
is
mid-november
almost,
january
01,
as
it
is
down
the
line,
we
look
at
it
--
supposed
this
court
does
not
get
around
deciding
this
case
before
january
01
which
would
probably
not
then
what
law
attains
on
this
case?
unknown
speaker
and
he
complains
bitterly
about
it?
unknown
speaker
and
he
complains
bitterly
about
it?
unknown
speaker
what
would
be
necessarily
followed
from
that
they
would
give
custody?
unknown
speaker
it
means
that
he
might
have
visitation?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
really
sounds
as
though,
you
are
requesting,
a
father
being
divorced
request?
unknown
speaker
fully?
unknown
speaker
but
he
has
certainly
scanned
in
a
testimony,
there
get
a
different
attitude
from
the
different
people
about
what
actually
happened?
unknown
speaker
i
realized
he
bought
a
10
speed
bike
but
i
wonder
what
else
he
did?
unknown
speaker
what
is
testified
what
are
the
facts?
unknown
speaker
what
about
total
lack
of
support?
suppose,
he
has
visited
the
child
and
never
purported
to
support
the
child
at
all,
had
been
asked
to
and
either
said
he
would
not
or
he
could
not?
unknown
speaker
so
you
do
not
--
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
contest
that?
unknown
speaker
suppose
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
he
cannot
support
the
child
totally.
that
he
can
say
give
$20
a
month?
unknown
speaker
but
that
that
is
not
any
wise
near
sufficient.
unknown
speaker
but
a
child
is
still
very
needy
and
the
step-father
wants
to
adopt
him
and
provide
for
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
can
darrell
inherit
from
the
step-father?
unknown
speaker
unless
he
is
adopted.
unknown
speaker
if
that
person
give
the
child
that
potentiality
does
not
give
the
child
any
right
in
terms
of
justice
white
was
addressing,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
the
way
you
make
claim,
is
it
dependent
on
the
tax
return?
unknown
speaker
either
of
them,
it
he
had
reached
to
provide
50%
to
both
of
them?
unknown
speaker
yeah,
will
we
not
accept
that
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
is
a
finding
that
the
child
has
never
been
in
an
abandoned
or
deprived
conditions
--
unknown
speaker
with
or
without
the
--?
unknown
speaker
i
said,
what
case
do
you
have
that
says
we
are
not
bound
by
the
findings
of
the
fact
of
the
georgia
court?
unknown
speaker
mr.
skinner,
while
you
are
interrupted,
you
mentioned
earlier
that
as
the
matter
of
georgia
law
the
filing
of
the
petition
to
legitimate
came
too
late
because
it
came
after
the
adoption
petition
had
been
filed.
could
you
tell
me
where
are
you
covered
that
in
your
brief
for
the
georgia
cases
that
so
hold
that?
unknown
speaker
smith
v.
smith?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
citation
to
that?
unknown
speaker
mr.
skinner,
do
you
agree
with
appelleeâ€™s
brief
that
if
you
prevail
in
this
case,
your
client
will
have
almost
an
absolute
veto
right
of
an
adoption
of
a
child
by
anyway?
unknown
speaker
your
client
does
not
wish
to
assume
custody
of
a
child
himself?
unknown
speaker
has
he
assumed
that
right
yet?
unknown
speaker
has
he
claimed
custody
himself
up
to
this
point?
unknown
speaker
right,
that
is
not
custody?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
your
client
was
a
nightclub
operator
and
a
single
man,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
any
court
would
give
him
custody?
unknown
speaker
right,
but
when
he
was
visiting
his
biological
father,
he
stayed
in
a
nightclub,
did
he
not?
unknown
speaker
where
did
he
stay
on
other
occasions?
unknown
speaker
but
then
he
was
not
visiting
his
biological
father?
unknown
speaker
right,
what
i
am
really
driving
at
is,
what
if
you
got
to
again
really
so
far
as
a
child
is
concerned,
by
prevailing
in
this
case?
what
is
your
ultimate
objective?
unknown
speaker
that
he
has
no
visitation
rights
now?
unknown
speaker
but
he
has
no
visitation
rights
now?
unknown
speaker
do
you
contend
that
if
he
had
been
married
and
divorced
and
had
treated
the
child
exactly
as
he
treated
this
child
as
a
divorced
father,
do
you
think
your
court
would
have
come
out
differently?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
that
you
would
not
agree,
but
i
want
to
know
what
the
georgia
courts
have
treated
him
differently,
the
divorced
father?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
the
standing
--
but
would
not
the
georgia
court
have
said,
well
you
have
not
paid
a
whole
lot
of
attention
to
your
child,
you
have
given
only
him
partial
support
and
we
say
that
you
do
not
have
the
right
to
object
to
the
adoption?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
what
i
want
to
do?
what
would
be
the
standard
if
your
client
had
been
a
divorced
father
in
attempting
to
object
to
an
adoption
by
the
husband
of
his
ex-wife?
unknown
speaker
as
in
subsection
2.
unknown
speaker
can
you
give
me
some
constructive
basis
to
that
argument?
unknown
speaker
never
trying
to
make
the
child
his
heir
as
he
could
by
legitimatizing
it?
unknown
speaker
i
am
talking
about
his
attitude.
i
am
not
sure
he
knew
about
these
cases?
unknown
speaker
he
certainly
did
know
about
trimble
v.
gordon
before
last
spring,
did
he
not?
unknown
speaker
suppose
a
father
simply
leaves
home,
there
is
no
divorce.
he
does
not
support
the
child
very
much,
sees
him
time
to
time,
no
divorce,
no
court
order
and
then
the
child
is
put
up
for
adoption
by
the
mother.
the
mother
wants
to
relinquish
her
rights
over
the
child
and
somebody
else
wants
to
adopt,
it
has
a
parent
then,
the
father
got
an
absolute
veto?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
mother
has
been
taking
care
of
child,
but
she
is
just
willing
to
relinquish
to
the
state?
unknown
speaker
i
still
do
not
understand
that
this
man
has
a
child
15
years,
he
did
not
legitimate
the
child.
he
came
to
set
for
abandonment?
unknown
speaker
but
what
would
that
be?
disown
him?
unknown
speaker
we
are
concerned
here,
are
we
not
counsel
only
with
the
constitutional
validity
of
georgia
court
annotated
section
74-403
(3)?
unknown
speaker
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
so
that
these
concerns
are
irrelevant
to
that
statutory
provision?
unknown
speaker
well,
counsel
let
me
ask
you
a
question
where
we
are
concerned
with
that
statute
if
at
least
as
i
would
state
and
as
it
was
applied
by
the
georgia
courts
in
this
case,
we
cannot
take
cognizance
of
some
peculiarity
in
the
statute
that
did
not
affect
the
outcome
of
this
case
that
we
might
find
objection
on
some
other
circumstances?
unknown
speaker
okay
that
is
all
i
want
to
make
sure.
unknown
speaker
now
you
and
your
colleague
then
do
to
differ
on
the
consequences
of
legitimation,
you
think
that
if
a
child
is
legitimated
the
father
who
does
the
legitimating
has
a
right
to
veto
an
adoption?
unknown
speaker
the
georgia
family
and
children
service
department
that
you
have
just
preferred
brought
in
most
or
all
of
the
adoption
cases
in
georgia?
unknown
speaker
are
you
defending
a
rule,
a
automatic
rule
that
a
father
of
an
illegitimate
child
is
automatically
not
given
standing
to
object
to
an
adoption
simply
because
he
has
not
legitimated
the
child?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
that
there
are
no
finding
in
this
case
and
no
basis
for
a
finding
that
he
had
failed
to
support
at
all,
that
he
had
regularly
seen
the
children
and
he
had
regularly
supported
them
fully
and
completely.
the
only
thing
the
mother
remarried
and
that
they
wanted
an
adoption?
unknown
speaker
so
you
say
yes,
you
do
defend
the
automatic
rule
even
though
he
has
completely
supported
the
child?
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
what
the
court
held
in
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
jones
in
that
connection
that
is
with
your
last
answer,
is
that
reconcilable
with
your
statement
in
the
brief
as
i
read
it
that
if
this
case
gets
caught
under
the
name
of
statutes,
it
is
lost?
unknown
speaker
that
will
not
take
place
you
feel?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
question
of
fact
was
that
you
say
that
he
has
not
failed
that
you
say
there
is
a
finding
that
he
has
failed
to
support
the
child?
unknown
speaker
what
would
be
the
place
of
legitimation
under
the
new
statute
itself
just
because
it
legitimated
the
child
would
not
automatically
give
him
a
right
to
object
to
the
adoption
if
he
had
failed
to
support?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
you
can
support
this
judgment
without
defending
the
automatic
rule?
unknown
speaker
except,
that
the
judgment
was
based
upon
the
simple
fact
that
the
child
was
illegitimate
and
this
was
the
illegitimate
father
that
is
what
the
trial
judge
very
explicitly
relied
upon?
unknown
speaker
page
7,
its
first
conclusion
of
law
that
child
in
question
being
illegitimate
the
consent
of
the
mother
alone
and
to
the
adoption
is
sufficient.
citing
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
and
he
never,
he
thought
since
a
statute
so
provided
that
he
could
not
even
give
a
illegitimate
father
any
opportunity
to
show
anything
further
and
that
is
what
the
statute
provide?
unknown
speaker
but
he
did
get
back
the
trial
judge
did
have
a
hearing
on
the
legitimation
petition
at
the
same
time
as
the
adoption
petition?
unknown
speaker
did
not
in
ruling
on
the
legitimation
petition,
did
the
trial
court
not
say
that
the
best
interest
of
the
child
would
not
be
served
by
legitimation?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
mr.
jones.
assume
we
are
right
and
assume
that
we
have
been
reviewed
that
this
judgment
could
be
supported
on
those
findings
as
the
best
interest
of
the
child?
unknown
speaker
where
does
leave
us
as
to
georgia
statute?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
difficulty
is
that
at
least
you
suggest
as
i
read
your
brief
as
my
brother
blackmun
said
earlier,
if
we
do
not
decide
this
case
by
january
01,
then
a
new
statute
becomes
effective,
your
brief
seems
to
have
suggested
then
this
case
would
be
controlled
by
the
new
statute?
unknown
speaker
well,
as
the
adoption
has
been
stayed?
unknown
speaker
would
the
statute
purport
to
apply
to
an
adoption
that
has
been
ordered
by
the
state
courts
and
the
state
courts
for
all
intents
and
purposes
are
through
with
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
may
or
may
not
be
that
the
entire
proceeding
may
be
over
but
to
what
proceedings
does
a
new
statute
say,
to
what
it
applies,
does
it
apply
to
adoption
proceedings
that
are
then
begun
before
them?
unknown
speaker
well,
fairly
that
is
matter
of
federal
law
is
it
not
that
the
georgia
courts
might
or
might
not
follow
the
cases
like
bradley
v.
the
richmond
school
board.
it
has
been
the
rule
in
the
federal
court
since
john
marshallâ€™s
decision
in
the
case
i
do
not
remember
that
we
apply
the
law
that
is
in
effect
at
the
time
we
decide
the
case.
i
presume
that
georgia
courts
might
be
free
to
adopt
that
policy
or
not
as
they
chose?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
jones,
actually
an
adoption
order
has
been
granted
in
this
case
has
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
working
at
the
opinion
of
your
supreme
court.
the
adoption
was
granted
and
legitimation
petition
of
visitation
rights
was
denied,
but
the
natural
father
appeals,
so
he
appeals
from
the
granting
of
the
adoption?
unknown
speaker
and
i
suppose
if
you
are
right
that
it
may
be
sustained
on
the
best
interests
of
the
child's
approach
with
that
reference
to
that
section
on
veto?
unknown
speaker
then
how
would
the
new
statute
become
affective
anyway
and
applicable
at
all?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
must
say
i
do
not
see
how
we
can
say
whether
the
new
statute
applies
or
does
not
apply?
but
i
take
it,
would
be
something
for
the
georgia
courts
in
the
first
instance.
i
do
not
see
that
we
can
say
whether
it
does
not.
it
is
a
matter
of
georgia
law,
it
is
not?
unknown
speaker
mr.
jones
i
have
been
struggling
through
what
i
think
is
a
copy
of
the
new
statute
appended
to
the
stateâ€™s
brief,
in
a
preliminary
brief
at
the
time
of
jurisdiction
state
law
has
filed
here?
am
i
correct
in
assuming
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
in
so
many
orders
that
excludes
his
application
to
pending
adoption
proceedings,
it
merely
says
that
it
will
take
effect
to
january
01,
1978?
unknown
speaker
so
it
is
the
problem
of
georgia
law
as
to
whether
it
affects
pending
proceedings?
unknown
speaker
the
adoption
has
taken
place,
has
it
not?
unknown
speaker
and
there
has
been
no
stay?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
has
--
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
by
force
of
the
notice
of
appeal?
unknown
speaker
what
is
that
rule
in
georgia
law,
while
it
was
on
appeal
with
the
georgia
supreme
court?
under
georgia
law,
does
taking
the
appeal
operated
as
supercedious?
unknown
speaker
in
the
georgia
system?
unknown
speaker
living
with
the
walcott?
unknown
speaker
mr.
jones,
i
understood
the
question
of
counsel
for
appellant
that
his
real
objective
is
to
obtain
visitation
rights.
did
the
georgia
court
have
that
power
under
georgia
law
to
accord
visitation
rights
under
the
present
statute.
i
assume
that
it
did
since
in
view
of
the
order
and
are
denying
those
rights?
unknown
speaker
right,
but
would
not
a
georgia
court
have
that
same
authority
under
the
new
statute?
unknown
speaker
but
even
so
take
the
case
of
an
absolute
divorce
in,
say
in
state
of
virginia
the
court
would
have
full
authority
to
allow
visitation
rights
to
the
father
after
he
no
longer
had
any
custody,
it
will
depend
on
the
best
interest
of
the
child
as
you
have
said,
what
i
am
driving
at
is
so
far
as
visitation
rights
are
concerned,
under
georgia
law,
does
it
make
any
difference
which
statute
is
applied?
unknown
speaker
well,
excuse
me.
on
georgia
law,
even
no
visitation
rights
were
feasible,
if
there
has
been
an
adoption?
no,
that
was
not
an
adoption.
unknown
speaker
is
that
true
under
georgia
law?
unknown
speaker
is
that
true
under
georgia
law?
that
in
adoption
there
are
no
visitation
rights,
that
is
my
second
question?
unknown
speaker
even
after
an
adoption,
but
after
giving
parental
rights
to
the
adoptive
father
they
would
still
have
to
allow
visitation
rights?
unknown
speaker
or
that
they
even
could?
unknown
speaker
these
were
alternative,
these
were
various
proceedings
that
were
consolidated.
unknown
speaker
this
is
the
alternatives
one
was
to
have
an
adoption
and
the
other
was
to
grant
this
habeas
corpus
petition
or
something
else
which
would
have
carried
with
visitation
rights?
unknown
speaker
but
there
are
alternatives.
once
the
child
is
adopted
he
becomes
the
son
or
daughter
of
father
of
the
adoptive
parents
and
all
visitation
rights
by
anybody
else
disappear?
unknown
speaker
mr.
jones
do
you
know
i
have
just
asked
the
same
question
in
a
little
different
form.
is
there
any
precedent
in
georgia
that
which
you
are
aware
or
there
is
a
divorce
and
then
a
remarriage
by
the
mother
who
has
custody
of
the
child
and
then
an
adoption
by
the
second
husband
of
the
mother
and
then
after
that
the
natural
father
seeking
visitation
rights?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that,
but
is
there
precedent
in
georgia
in
the
sequence
i
described
for
allowing
the
natural
father
to
retain
visitation
rights
notwithstanding
the
adoption
by
the
second
husband
of
the
mother?
unknown
speaker
may
be
he
consented
to
the
adoption,
somebody
consented
to
the
adoption?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
perhaps
too
far.
unknown
speaker
that
the
child
was
really
very
diplomatic
he
did
not
want
to
hurt
anybodyâ€™s
feeling?
