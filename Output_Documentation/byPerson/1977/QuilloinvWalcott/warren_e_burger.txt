chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
76-6372
quilloin
against
walcott.
mr.
skinner
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
referring
now
to
the
new
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
tell
us
so
that
we
have
it
thoroughly
entirely
before
us,
unless
what
the
old
statute
is
again
and
that
what
the
new
statute
is?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
he
did
file
one
afterwards
did
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
not
the
fulton
county
superior
court
judge
find
that
it
was
in
the
best
interest
of
the
minor
child
to
grant
the
legitimation
after
the
long
lapse
of
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
not
one
of
his
findings
in
the
appendix?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
for
11
years,
he
could
have
legitimated?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
under
georgia
law,
he
would
not
be,
would
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
calling
him
a
defective
divorced
man
does
not
really
change
the
legal
issues
in
this
case?
are
you
taking
the
position
that
he
has
supported
darrell
all
through
these
years?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
superior
court’s
finding
number
3
on
page
71
of
the
appendix
is
that
the
father
has
provided
support
for
the
child
irregularly
in
the
form
of
medical
attention,
food,
clothing,
gifts
and
toys
from
time
to
time.
it
seems
to
me
you
are
putting
a
little
bit
of
a
favorable
gloss
on
that
finding
in
your
answer
which
i
suppose
that
the
attorney
is
entitled?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
anyone
can
make
a
will
leaving
money
to
the
child.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
i
do
not
think
the
finding
is
very
ambiguous.
the
finding
of
following
the
one
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
read
to
you
is
the
principle
or
primary
source
of
support
on
a
regular
basis
has
been
the
mother
or
maternal
grand
parents,
nothing
ambiguous
about
that,
is
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
when
you
characterize
the
adoption
as
being
for
the
purpose
you
have
just
mentioned,
is
it
not
reasonable
to
say
that
the
purpose
of
the
adoption
was
to
give
by
the
foster
father
to
give
the
child
something
the
biological
father
never
gave
him
namely
-
a
home,
right
to
inherit.
he
has
none
of
those
things
from
his
biological
father,
does
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
can
ponder
on
that
answer
now
until
1
o’clock
counsel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
counsel
you
may
resume
your
argument
you
have
nine
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
major
interest
that
he
has
shown
in
this
child
the
major
interest
not
the
only
interest
is
to
blacklist
adoption?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
jones.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
relevant
at
all
to
purposes
of
the
statute,
assuming
purposes
then
become
important.
that
it
is
relatively
easy
to
identify
the
mother
of
any
illegitimate
child
not
always
easy
to
identify
the
father?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
does
not
underly
the
legitimacy
statutes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
first
i
suppose
from
your
point
of
view
if
we
decided
in
your
favor
and
decide
within
the
30
or
60
days
that
solve
the
problems?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
turning
to
the
judge’s
order
on
page
72,
the
fulton
county
superior
court
order,
he
first
makes
the
finding
in
14
that
the
proposed
adopted
father
is
a
proper
person
to
adopt
the
child
and
then
finding
15
that
proposed
adoption
of
the
child
is
in
the
best
interest
of
the
said
child
and
finding
16
for
proposed
legitimation
of
the
child
is
not
in
the
best
interest,
nor
is
the
granting
of
the
habeas
corpus
relief
seeking
visitation
rights
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child.
does
that
not
sound
as
he
at
least
thought
that
you
might
have
an
adoption
and
still
grant
visitation
rights?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
one
minute
left
mr.
skinner.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
76-6372
quilloin
against
walcott
is
to
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
marshall.
