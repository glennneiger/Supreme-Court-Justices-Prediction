mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
appellant
in
this
case
is
paul
mcdaniel,
a
minister
from
chattanooga,
tennessee.
he
declared
as
a
candidate
and
properly
filed
as
a
candidate
for
delegate
to
the
1977
tennessee
constitutional
convention
at
which
time
he
was
sued
by
one
of
his
opponents
to
have
his
name
stricken
from
the
ballot
because
he
was
a
minister
of
the
gospel
and
a
provision
of
the
present
tennessee
constitution
article
9
provides
that
no
priest
or
minister
of
the
gospel
may
serve
in
legislative
office
in
tennessee
and
the
call
to
the
tennessee
constitutional
convention
of
1977,
picked
up
that
qualification
for
persons
who
were
to
serve
as
delegates
to
the
constitutional
convention.
the
matter
was
heard
in
the
chancery
court
in
hamilton
county
and
the
chancellor
enjoined
the
requirement
as
being
in
violation
of
the
free
exercise
of
religion.
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
tennessee
supreme
court
which
remanded
for
not
having
given
notice
to
the
attorney
general,
the
case
was
then
heard
in
the
chancery
court
of
hamilton
county
with
the
attorney
general
appearing
and
the
chancellor
again
enjoined
the
provision
on
establishment
clause
grounds.
during
the
period
when
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
tennessee
supreme
court
by
the
state
and
ms.
paty,
the
election
was
held
and
reverend
mcdaniel
won
handily.
he
came
with
a
few
votes
of
having
more
than
the
other
three
candidates
combined.
the
tennessee
supreme
court
heard
this
case
and
decided
that
reverend
mcdaniel
could
not
serve
because
of
the
provision
of
the
tennessee
constitution
and
upheld
the
exclusion
on
separation
grounds.
counsel
then
sought
a
stay
from
mr.
justice
stewart
which
was
denied
with
suggestion
that
application
be
made
to
the
tennessee
supreme
court
which
was
then
done
and
the
tennessee
supreme
court
granted
a
stay
until
june
20,
1977,
at
which
time
the
tennessee
supreme
court
denied
a
second
request
for
a
stay
and
mr.
justice
stewart
then
granted
appellant’s
request
for
a
stay.
the
constitutional
convention
began
august
01,
1977
and
reverend
mcdaniel
has
been
sitting
as
a
delegate
to
that
convention
under
the
stay
granted
by
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
the
constitutional
convention
is
still
on
session.
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
it
is
very
difficult
to
predict
when
legislative
groups
in
tennessee
will
end.
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
clearly,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
you
know,
that
issue
that,
we
face
that
issue
in
the
brief,
on
the
waiving
of
this
question
and
this
was
a
very
much
question
in
the
england,
can
one
renounce
his
ministry,
can
one
be
defrocked
and
then
run
for
office.
it
is
by
no
means
clear
on
the
face
of
the
tennessee,
a
disqualifying
provision
whether
that
could
be
done.
now,
this
case,
the
issues
in
this
case
involve
several
provisions
of
a
constitution.
this
is
a
voting
rights
case.
it
involves
a
right
to
be
a
candidate
for
a
public
office
which
this
court
has
vindicated
in
the
past.
it
involves
voting
rights
as
well
since
the
right
to
vote
for
priest
or
ministers
of
the
gospel
is
an
important
right.
we
face
the
same
question
in
this
case
that
was
faced
by
the
court
some
years
back
when
it
addressed
the
question
of
whether
the
persons
in
the
military
could
be
fenced
out
from
candidacy
or
from
exercise
of
their
voting
rights.
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
its
my
opinion
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
this
was
done
in
bullock
and
in
lubin
v.
panish
and
in
american
party
of
texas
v.
white.
it
seems
to
me
that
one
can
say
that
the
rights
of
candidates,
qua
candidates
were
vindicated
in
these
cases
although
i
do
not
think
it
makes
a
great
deal
of
difference
even
if
the
court
should
choose
to
vindicate
these
rights
as
voting
rights.
we
also
have
at
stake
here
free
exercise
rights
because
reverend
mcdaniel
has
chosen
to
exercise
his
rights
as
a
minister
of
the
gospel.
he
has
been
penalized
in
his
voting
rights
so
you
have
a
situation
where
the
appellant
is
put
in
the
--
to
the
absence
of
choice
of
either
choosing
between
his
voting
rights
which
this
court
has
declared
are
fundamental,
or
his
free
exercise
rights
which
this
court
has
declared
are
fundamental.
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
yes,
yes
or
for
any
other
minister
since
this
has
been
certified
as
a
class
action
by
the
chancellor
of
the
hamilton
county
court.
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
well,
we
look
--
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
we
look
upon
the
--
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
yes,
but
we
think
the
voting
rights
cases
of
this
court
are
sufficient
to
--
as
well
to
give
--
to
seek
a
vote.
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
all
ministers
who
shall
be
candidates
for
office
of
delegate
to
the
constitutional
--
to
there
is
a
future
constitutional
conventions
and
all
candidates
for
legislative
office.
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
well,
we
think
there
may
be
a
number
of
other
ministers
who
--
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
well,
mr.
justice
marshall,
it
is
my
understanding
that
there
are
several
other
ministers
who
are
serving
at
this
time
as
delegates
to
the
tennessee
constitutional
convention.
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
we
did
not
know
at
the
time
that
this
class
was
certified
that
--
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
the
state
class
action
requirement
is
patterned
upon
rule
23.
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
well,
that
is
point
well
taken
your
honor.
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
that
has
an
inhibition
--
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
i
think
that
the
--
it
--
that
really
would
not
matter
very
much;
however,
because
if
the
class
for
relief
or
afforded
as
appellants
are,
any
minister
who
ever
wanted
to
seek
legislative
office
in
tennessee
would
be
allowed
to
do
so.
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
i
think
it
is
important
for
this
reason.
if
we
strike
down
chapter
848
of
the
tennessee
public
acts
of
1976,
a
dealing
with
the
call
to
this
convention
then
we
only
deal
with
this
particular
call
and
it
means
that
next
year
should
some
minister
in
tennessee
choose
to
be
a
candidate
for
legislative
office
that
he
could
be
excluded
under
this
provision
and
it
would
entail
the
great
expense
that
has
been
entailed
in
this
or
any
other
case
that
comes
to
this
court,
to
afford
relief
and
we
may
not
have
before
to
at
this
event
then
which
occurred
here.
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
well,
the
only
problem
that
i
could
see
coming
from
that
is
that
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
limited
the
cross
appeal
taken
by
appellant
from
the
chancellor’s
ruling
to
this
particular
case
and
this
particular
statute
and
they
relied
on
i
believe
the
storey
(ph)
case
in
tennessee
which
in
our
brief
counsel
has
alleged
is
an
epperson.
the
--
it
is
simply
a
quest
of
whether
this
court
is
willing
to
resolve
this
question
in
tennessee.
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
that
is
quite
true
sir,
but
it
is
also
true
that
chancellors
and
circuit
judges
at
the
local
level
in
tennessee
may
view
precedents
in
very
different
lights
and
if
this
court
granted
relief
only
as
to
the
call
for
the
1976
--
1977
convention,
it
is
possible
that
some
local
judge
may
try
to
distinguish
that
away,
and
deny
relief
to
some
ministerial
candidate
for
a
legislative
office
then
the
election
would
be
held
and
ultimately
even
though
the
state
appellate
court
may
choose
to
grant
relief
it
would
be
faced
with
a
very
disruptive
possibility
of
having
to
invalidate
an
election,
call
an
election
again.
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
you
know,
we
are
very
lucky
that
we
had
a
good
chancellor
at
the
local
level
who
afforded
relief
and
allowed
our
candidate
to
run.
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
very
fine.
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
yeah,
but
we
do
not
have
him
in
every
county
in
tennessee
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
we
do
not
expect
that,
but
we
would
like
--
we
do
think
that
we
are
entitled
to
a
decree
that
would
prevent
the
state
of
tennessee
from
ever
disqualifying
for
candidacy
for
a
public
office.
any
person
because
of
his
being
a
priest
or
a
minister
of
the
gospel.
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
in
my
opinion
it
certainly
would.
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
because
that
is
--
that
is
a
matter
of
choosing
between
two
secular
offices
and
the
state
can
decide
that
a
man
ought
to
spend
all
of
his
time
on
one
secular
office
and
not
split
his
responsibilities,
but
the
state
under
the
first
amendment,
under
the
establishment
clause
and
under
the
free
exercise
clause,
state
has
no
business
interfering
in
what
a
person
does
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
well,
as
to
the
influence
of
ministers,
i
do
not
think
that
it
would
be
permissible
to
exclude
presidents
of
cooperations
and
many
of
them
exert
substantial
influence,
presidents
of
universities,
many
of
them
exert
substantial
influence
and
i
would
say
that
it
would
certainly
deny
ministers
as
a
client’s
equal
protection
to
treat
them
differently
from
other
persons
who
have
equal
or
greater
amounts
of
influence.
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
i
think
it
would
violate
equal
protection
clause
because
it
would
be
treating
people
who
are
similarly
situated
differently.
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
well,
we
have
a
reference
to
that
in
the
brief,
and
in
that
column
it
was
called
the
black
learning
parliament.
i
think
that
a
case
could
be
made
for
excluding
lawyers
which
could
not
be
made
for
excluding
ministers.
i
would
hate
to
see
that
done.
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
because
it
would
be
singling
out
an
occupational
class
for
invidious
treatment
without
any
reference
to
the
capacity
of
that
group
to
serve.
many
of
the
lawyers
who
serve
in
legislatures,
serve
very
honorably
and
with
distinction
and
in
49
other
states
in
the
union,
ministers
are
permitted
to
serve
in
the
legislature
and
it
is
only
because
of
anachronism
that
goes
back
to
the
tennessee
constitution
of
1796.(voice
overlap)
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
well,
i
answered
mr.
justice
steven’s
question.
i
think
the
state
could
certainly
exclude
justices
of
its
court
from
serving
in
the
legislature
or
any
officer
in
government.
there
is
no
problem
with
the
validity
of
the
patch
(ph)
act
to
similar
state
laws.
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
well,
i
think
that
was
--
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
well,
but
whereas
a
minister
--
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
i
do
not
know.
ministers
--
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
i
think
the
state
might
exclude
any
state
officer
because
--
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
how
it
say
even
if
he
happens
to
be
a
minister.
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
as
a
state
employee.
yes,
that
would
be
a
rationale
classification,
but
this
classification
is
not
rationale
and
it
singles
out
persons
for
invidious
treatment
because
of
their
--
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
i
think
it
is
both
sir.
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
and
i
--
that
we
submit
this
as
a
--
this
that
the
--
of
course
the
free
exercise
and
establishment
clauses
have
been
incorporated
or
absorbed
by
the
fourteenth
and
in
that
sense
it
is
both
the
first
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
case.
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
yes,
it
is
an
equal
protection
case
in
that
we
are
contending
that
the
state
has
denied
the
voting
rights
and
rights
of
political
candidacy
to
ministers
and
i
cited
earlier
the
cases
on
which
we
rely
on
voting.
i
also
think
its
a
due
process
case
on
vagueness
grounds.
who
is
there
to
determine,
who
is
a
minister
or
priest;
within
the
meaning
of
this
tennessee
statute.
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
it
is
a
very
difficult
task
and
it
invites
the
very
type
of
entanglement
problems
that
this
court
has
tried
to
avoid,
determining
who
is
a
minister
--
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
yes,
there
are
--
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
no,
we
--
i
am
sure
that
our
list
was
not,
was
not
exhaustive,
but
it
was
suggestive
of
the
--
of
a
number
of
denominations
which
the
mormons
for
example
require
that
each
member
of
the
faith
engage
in
a
ministry
of
several
years,
when
they
perform
religious
functions.
the
--
a
number
of
fundamentalist
religions
hire
working
preachers
who
are
involved
in
the
community
and
they
have
own
job,
they
support
themselves
with
a
regular
job,
but
they
preach
on
sunday,
would
such
a
person
be
disqualifying
under
the
tennessee
act.
we
think
that
the
vagueness
problems
on
due
process
grounds
with
the
statute
are
very
substantial.
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
no
vagueness
absolutely
not.
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
there
is
a
vital
distinction
between
the
situation
in
england
in
1641
and
the
situation
in
tennessee
in
1796
in
that
the
church
was
established
in
england
and
the
danger
in
england
was
that
the
commons
which
controlled
the
appropriation
of
funds,
if
dominated
by
anglican
priests,
would
vogue
the
state
church
great
sums
of
money.
since
we
have
no
established
church
in
tennessee
and
never
have
had
an
established
church,
i
think
the
argument
would
be
an
opposite,
but
i
think
you
know
that
1641
act,
with
frames
like
that
the
church
needs
few
in
its.
a
couple
other
points;
the
constitution,
the
body
of
the
constitution
itself
ride
in
the
same
section
with
the
supremacy
clause,
provides
that
there
shall
be
no
religious
test
for
office.
now,
there
is
some
question
as
to
whether
that
applies
to
state
offices,
or
whether
it
applies
only
to
federal
offices,
but
it
seems
to
me,
coming
where
it
does
in
the
constitution,
with
the
supremacy
clause,
that
that
clause
of
a
constitution
also
affords
a
basis
for
overturning
this
constitution,
this
requirement.
now,
of
course
the
support
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
are
not
as
great
for
that
argument
as
it
is
for
the
arguments
that
i
have
been
discussing,
but
i
do
think
that
that
is
a
a
respectable
argument.
it
has
been
made,
i
believe
mr.
justice
black
a
number
of
years
back
uses
this
either
a
basis
of
a
concurring
or
a
dissenting
opinion
and
i
think
a
respectable
argument
can
be
made
looking
back
to
farrand
records
of
the
federal
convention
and
even
if
the
court
were
to
decide
that,
that
clause
did
not
apply
in
full
force
at
the
time
it
was
adopted,
it
would
be
permissible
for
that
guarantee
as
being
a
fundamental
guarantee
to
be
received
through
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
yes,
sir.
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
which
is
a
credit
and
strength.
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
well,
thomas
in
this
view
commended
itself
to
thomas
jefferson
only
at
a
time
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
first
amendment
and
i
think
that
explains
mr.
jefferson’s
position.
i
think
historically,
one
can
justify
these
clauses
in
the
state
constitutions
of
1776
because
at
the
time
the
church
in
this
county
had
not
been
disestablished
and
as
your
honor
knows
the
church
was
not
disestablished
i
think
in
massachusetts
until
1830
or
1831,
so
there
was
a
very
great
fear
of
an
established
church,
but
the
first
amendment
with
its
establishment
clause
put
those
fears
to
rest
and
it
is
interesting
that
this
tennessee
provision
with
1796,
this
is
only
four
years
after
the
first
amendment
or
five
years,
the
--
so
it
is,
this
amendment
is
--
this,
this
tennessee
provision
is
really
contemporaneous
with
the
first
amendment
and
it
policy
wise,
it
looks
back
to
a
time
before
the
first
amendment.
now,
whether
or
not
the
framers
of
this
amendment
were
anti-clerical,
there
were
some
anti-clerical
forces
in
tennessee
at
that
time
or
whether
they
were
trying
to
give
a
preference
for
religion,
in
either
case
the
clause
would
fall
on
establishment
clause
grounds.
your
honor,
if
i
may,
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
save
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
briefly.
the
separation
of
church
and
state
argument
which
has
been
made
by
the
attorney
general
of
tennessee
is
a
state
doctrine
and
it
is
our
position
that
this
runs
a
foul
of
the
federal
separation
of
church
and
state
doctrine.
the
question
of
whether
this
case
is
brought
as
a
class
action
to
this
court,
appellant’s
position
on
that
issue
is
that
it
was
properly
certified
as
a
class
action
by
the
chancery
and
that
the
authority
on
which
the
tennessee
court
relied
to
deny
the
cross
appeal
of
appellant
was
in
opposite
--
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
it
is
a
question
of
whether
or
not
this
issue
must
be
addressed
again
in
some
other
litigation
after
this
case
has
been
decided.
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
the
rights,
person
similarly
situated
to
reverend
mcdaniel
to
assert
their
federally
protected
rights
to
seek
legislative
office
in
the
--
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
it
would
be
in
the
voting
rights,
it
would
be
in
the
same
free
exercise
and
establishment
rights
that
are
being
asserted
here.
it
is
also
a
question
of
economics.
it
is
a
question
of
whether
or
not
counsel
--
whether
that
there
is
a
likelihood
of
this
court’s
decision
leaving
open
the
way
for
counsel
to
have
to
come
back
up
and
do
this
sort
of
thing
again
on
candidacy
for
legislative
office.
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
i
would
be
very
much
in
favor
of
saving
the
money.
indeed
that
speaking
of
money,
this
is
a
1983
action
for
which
if
appellant
prevails
there
is
a
right
to
attorney
fees
also
under
the
voting
right
section
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1975,
there
is
a
provision
for
an
award
of
attorney
fees
to
prevailing
counsel
in
voting
rights
litigations
or
it
would
seem
to
me
that
it
would
even
be
in
the
interest
of
the
state
of
tennessee
to
have
the
thing
decided
once
and
for
all
unless
they
want
to
pay
counsel
to
do
the
same
thing
that
has
already
been
done.
the
matter
of
ministers
having
special
privileges
being
excluded
from
the
service,
ready
answer
to
that
which
we
provided
in
our
brief,
is
that
this
is
to
encourage
the
free
exercise
rights
of
those
who
have
been
removed
from
their
churches
by
being
drafted
or
otherwise
going
into
the
army.
the
tax
rights,
similarly
this
is
to
advance
free
exercise
rights,
the
tax
advantages
which
are
afforded
to
ministers.
the
difference
between
the
tax
advantages
and
the
service
provisions
relating
to
ministers
involved
in
this
case,
is
it
here
there
is
a
penalty
against
ministers
and
those
cases
involve
preferences.
so
one
other
point
the
--
the
it
--
although
it
is
not
commanded
a
majority
view
on
this
court,
it
is
the
case
that
the
appellant
is
a
black
minister
and
in
the
amended
complaint
it
was
alleged
that
the
affect
of
this
provision
is
to
disproportionately
exclude
a
black
leadership
from
candidacy
for
a
public
office
because
this
court
can
take
notice
of
that
fact
--
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
we
got
a
lot
of
them,
but
what
we
are
saying
is
that
the
leadership
in
the
black
community
traditionally
has
been
overrepresented
in
the
ministry
and
even
though
this
court
--
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
i
believe
that
the
--
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
your
honor,
my
time
is
up,
but
i
would
write
to
respond
to
--
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
in
law
or
in
medicine?
black
lawyers
or
black
doctors
could
run
for
office.
black
ministers
cannot
and
since
leadership
--
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
i
think
this
--
this
case
trans
--
certainly
transcends
racial
rounds
because
it
affects
white
ministers
as
well
as
blacks.
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
no,
its
just
an
additional
reason.
mr.
frederic
s.
leclercq
alright
sir.
