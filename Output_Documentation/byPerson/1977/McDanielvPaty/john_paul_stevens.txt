justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
leclercq
could
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
theory
on
the
merits.
supposing
tennessee
had
a
law
that
said
that
no
one,
simply
decide
they
want
to
have
a
fresh
look
at
the
whole
governmental
structure
and
they
would
like
to
exclude
from
those
participating
in
the
constitutional
convention
anyone
presently
serving
in
the
state
legislature
or
in
the
state
executive
department,
so
they
have
just
excluded
all
senior
government
officials,
would
that
be
permissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
why
would
they
not
be
forced
to
make
the
same
kind
of
absence
of
choice
between
serving
in
the
legislature
or
serving
in
the
constitutional
convention?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
their
theory
is
that
well,
these
people
now
in
public
office
are
unduly
influential
on
the
deliberations
of
the
new
body
and
they
might
think
ministers
are
unduly
persuasive,
they
can
use
certain
kinds
of
arguments
that
some
of
the
rest
of
us
cannot
use
and
so
we
better
keep
them
out
of
these
debates?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
attorney
general,
it
was
in
the
state
said
that
nobody
who
goes
to
church
every
week
shall
serve
in
the
state
legislature,
a
regular
church
goers
are
two
religions
have
a
complete
separation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
believe
that
nothing
would
prevent
them
from
pertaining
to
go
to
church,
it
is
just
could
not
be
in
the
state
legislature
that
is
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
that
would
be
equally
valid
or
invalid
like
this
statute?
