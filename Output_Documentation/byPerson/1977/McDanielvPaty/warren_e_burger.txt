chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
number
1427,
mcdaniel
v.
paty.
mr.
leclercq,
i
think
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
will
happen
counsel,
if
upon
the
election
or
upon
filing
as
a
candidate
under
the
tennessee
law,
the
ordained
minister
renounced
his
ordination
and
resigned,
would
that
clear
him
with
the
disability
or
do
we
not
know?
is
there
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
might
be
tainted
for
life?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
does
in
the
class
include
every
ordained
minister
in
the
state
of
tennessee,
whether
or
not
he
has
a
present
intention
of
running
for
anything?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
an
inhibition
that
whole
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
supreme
court
is
in
inhibition
now
trusting
on
every
ordained
minister
in
the
state,
is
it
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
is
very
important
to
us
now
for
our
purposes
whether
it
is
hyper
class
action
or
whether
it
is
only
one
man?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you
would
have
all
the
same
remedies
that
were
available
to
you
in
this
case,
would
you
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
stating
of
the
state
processes
-
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
your
theory
he
would
not
be
singled
out
as
a
a
minister,
but
as
a
state
employee?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
ultimately
i
suppose
your
state
supreme
court
would
--
might
be
called
upon
to
do
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
many
--
how
many
denominations
make
all
of
them
members,
adherence
ministers
of
that
church.
there
are
several
i
believe?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
recall
in
your
brief
you
numbered
all
of
them
or
not,
undertook
to?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
herrell.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
are
all
expressed
provisions
which
is
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
a
transition
or
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
then
this
brings
us
to
attention
a
potential
conflict
between
the
establishment
clause
and
the
free
exercise
clause,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
happen
to
know
whether
we
have
had
any
presidents
except
one
who
was
an
ordained
minister?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
president
wilson
was
a
presbyterian
minister
of
course,
no
other
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
your
submission
i
take
it
that
those
denominations
which
make
all
of
the
members
ministers
of
that
church,
would
exclude
all
the
members?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
under
the
tennessee
definition
must
there
be
an
identifiable
congregation
in
order
to
make
its
leader
a
minister?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
do
you
not
have
anything
further
mr.
leclercq?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may
respond
i
took
your
response
to
mean
that
of
the
professions,
negroes
are
proportionately
have
a
higher
representation
in
the
clergy
than
in
other
professions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
does
it
really
have
anything
to
do
with
race
at
all?
suppose
we
had
not
known
because
i
did
not
that
this
man
was
a
negro,
white,
chinese
or
whatever.
does
it
make
any
difference
to
the
fundamental
issues
that
you
are
presenting
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
we
continue
to
concern
ourselves
with
the
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
the
judgment
to
announce
in
mcdaniel
against
paty.
the

morning.

no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decisions
of
this
case.
