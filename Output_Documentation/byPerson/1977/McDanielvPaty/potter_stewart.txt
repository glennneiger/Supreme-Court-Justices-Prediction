one
may
be
--
both
may
be
fundamental,
but
only
one
is
a
constitutionally
protected
right,
is
that
not
correct?
you
read
the
case
minor
v.
happerstett,
you
will
find
it
stated
there
by
the
court
unanimously
as
i
remember
that
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
vote?
justice
potter
stewart
because
that
case,
it
may
necessary
the
amendment
of
our
constitution
to
allow
woman
to
vote,
that
was
an
equal
protection
case.
court
said
the
equal
protection
clause
gave
no
such
right?
justice
potter
stewart
whereas
the
first
amendment
protects
and
creates
freedoms

rights
to
that?

what
is
the
valid
secular
objective
here?

potter
stewart
and
that
is
the
only?
