justice
william

any
anticipation
or
anything
you
tell
from
the

about
when
they
expected
it
end?
justice

or
anywhere
else?
justice
william

describe
the
right
to
be
a
candidate?
justice

his
voting
rights
being
his
right

justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
this
court
always
if
it
--
suppose
if
we
disagree
with
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
our
mandate
as
always
vacated
and
reversed
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
this
opinion.
we
would
not
tell
as
i
understand
our
practice,
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
what
the
form
of
mandate
to
send
down
to
the
chancery
court
in
hamilton
county,
so
long
as
it
was
not
inconsistent
with
our
opinion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
have
a
precedent
in
any
event.
if
we
said
--
if
we
simply
decided
it
on
a
narrowest
of
grounds
which
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
got
a
good
circuit
justice?[laughter]
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
your
opponent
was
complained
not
so
much
about
the
distinctions
between
priests
and
ministers
as
distinctions
--
as
the
distinction
between
the
clergy
and
the
rest
of
the
population?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
federal
question
is
raised
by
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
federal
right
were
you
denied
by
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee's
ruling
on
that
aspect
of
the
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
do
we
find
that
enunciated
in
the
constitution
or
in
the
cases?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
against
that
or
for
that?
