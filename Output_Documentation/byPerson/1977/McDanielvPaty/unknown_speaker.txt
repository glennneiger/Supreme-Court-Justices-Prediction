unknown
speaker
but
there
is
vagueness
as
to
your
client
to
mr.
leclercq
(voice
overlap)
unknown
speaker
with
respect
to
the
1641
legislation
in
england,
your
very
interesting
brief
describe
the
historical
conditions
then
and
how
important
the
clergy
was
in
england
at
that
time.
if
we
thought
that
the
clergy
was
equally
important
in
tennessee
when
this
statute
was
passed,
would
you
say
that
statute
was
unrational?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
one
other
historical
question
mr.
leclercq?
unknown
speaker
your
brief
pointed
out
that
that
thomas
jefferson
once
might
have
disagreed
with
your
argument
here
and
that
he
later
changed
his
mind
--
unknown
speaker
but
you
suppose
anything,
any
provision
that
could
have
commended
itself
to
justice,
to
thomas
jefferson
even
for
a
few
years
and
even
temporarily
it
could
be
so
irrational,
we
have
to
strike
it
down?
unknown
speaker
but
you
said
they
--
do
i
understand
you
to
say
you
could
say
that
as
long
as
you
serve
in
the
legislature,
you
may
not
go
to
church
more
than
once
a
month?
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
--
that
sounds
to
me
like
what
you
said,
at
least
you
may
not
go
to
church
every
week?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
that
is
what
i
thought
is
that
what
you
have
answered
to
mr.
justice
stevens?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
they
paid
by
the
state,
provided
by
the
state?
unknown
speaker
is
that
what
you
are
telling
us?
there
are
some
states
where
they
permit
ministers
from
the
outside,
but
not
necessarily
making
them
employees
of
the
state,
i
wanted
to
be
sure
that
which
tennessee
has?
unknown
speaker
mr.
attorney
general
i
just
before
you
finish
your
opponent
made
some,
places
an
emphasis
on
whether
or
not
there
was
an
established
church
in
jurisdiction
which
had
this
sort
of
provision?
does
tennessee
have
an
established
church
at
the
very
beginning
of
its
statehood?
unknown
speaker
and
how
about
this
law
state
of
franklin
that
forgets
it
is
intermediate
between
north
carolina
and
tennessee.
was
that
any
established
church
in
that
state
as
far
as
you
know?
unknown
speaker
franklin
went
back
in
the
north
carolina
i
thought
was
part
of
eastern
tennessee?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
by
trying
to
taking
--
unknown
speaker
you
cannot
put
the
thread
back
on
a
tire
by
running
the
car
in
reverse?
