mr.
kenneth
r.
herrell
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
under
the
constitution
that
we
live
under
in
this
country,
we
have
certain
fundamental
rights
which
are
gained
to
us
or
guaranteed
to
us
by
the
constitution
and
the
amendments.
these
are
fundamental,
so
fundamental
that
they
cannot
be
taken
away
from
this.
however,
we
also
have
other
rights
that
we
have
enjoy
in
this
country
that
can
be
somewhat
preemptive
because
they
are
not
absolutely
guaranteed
by
our
constitution.
the
case
we
have
for
consideration
here
today
involves
these
two
questions,
these
two
principles
which
i
want
to
explore.
these
cover
all
the
issues,
i
believe
that
have
been
made
in
this
case,
the
issue
of
free
exercise
of
religion,
the
establishment
clause,
the
equal
protection
clause
and
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
kenneth
r.
herrell
right.
mr.
kenneth
r.
herrell
yes
sir,
but
this
--
my
purpose
here
that
i
want
to
attempt
to
distinguish
this
case
as
it
has
been
decided
by
this
court
citing
certain
applications
of
a
person’s
right
and
they
first
categorically
have
cases
where
they
are
absolute
that
is
the
right
pertaining
to
a
belief.
this
cannot
be
changed
by
our
concept
of
a
constitution.
this
court
would
not
do
so.
however,
there
are
certain
practices
which
cannot
be
limited
i
think
by
the
application
of
activities
of
a
person
who
wants
to
enjoy
his
rights
under
a
constitution.
for
instance,
this
court
has
said
in
the
castle
case,
a
case
is
not
taken
to
interpret
the
question
of
a
right
or
a
belief.
this
court
said
properly
that
that
could
not
be
compelled.
likewise
the
case
has
said,
therefore,
you
have
a
question
involving
sanctions,
as
it
was
indicated
in
the
schempp
case.
that
cannot
be
condoned.
now,
as
this
court
has
said
in
cantwell
the
free
actively
to
have
to
act
is
not
absolute,
it
comes
in
this
later
category
and
cannot
be
subject
to
certain
limitations
where
there
are
proper
basis
for
it.
for
instance,
in
the
sherbert
case,
this
court
said
that
was
an
indirect
burden
by
inhabit
to
free
exercise
right
where
there
is
a
compelling
state
interest.
in
the
braunfeld
case,
the
court
has
said
that
a
state
may
limit
a
person’s
practice.
you
know
it
may
cause
some
inconvenience
in
time
and
in
walz
case,
a
valid
secular
objective
is
an
appropriate
subject
of
legislation.
we
submit
that
that
is
what
we
have
for
consideration
before
us
at
this
time.
now,
as
to
the
establishment
clause,
i
do
not
think
that
at
least
be
said
there
is
any
question,
but
what
the
purpose
of
this
clause
is
to
keep
the
state
from
establishing
any
form
of
religion,
any
requirement
for
a
particular
religi.
we
submit
that
there
has
been
no
establishment
created
by
the
virtue
of
the
acts
in
question
here,
and
again,
under
schempp,
a
secular
purpose
is
a
valid
basis
for
a
legislative
purpose.
mr.
kenneth
r.
herrell
that
is
the
separation
of
church
and
state,
that
i
want
to
get
into.
mr.
kenneth
r.
herrell
yes
sir.
mr.
kenneth
r.
herrell
that
is
correct
and
that
is
the
point
that
i
want
to
explore
now
on
test
that
this
court
has
used
in
interpreting
this
kind
of
--
kinds
of
--
cases
of
this
kind.
mr.
kenneth
r.
herrell
it
was
enacted
in
original
constitution
of
tennessee
in
1796,
but
it
was
carried
over
basically
from
the
constitution
of
north
carolina.
mr.
kenneth
r.
herrell
no,
sir.
mr.
kenneth
r.
herrell
no,
sir.
mr.
kenneth
r.
herrell
well,
it
is
before
the
court
now.
there
are
three
tests
that
this
court
can
consider
as
been
recognized
previously
as
a
basis
for
a
test
to
consider
the
application
of
this
test.
the
rationale
basis
test,
that
is
the
minimum
test
and
to
the
other
extreme
there
is
a
compelling
state
interest
test,
which
is
on
not
relevant
to
get
into
now
and
we
submit
to
the
court
that
the
proper
test
for
this
court
as
laid
down
in
bullock
is
the
strict
scrutiny
test.
what
basis
that
does
a
state
have?
is
it
sufficient?
the
state
submits
that
it
is
a
sufficient
basis.
under
this
principle,
the
test
the
system
must
be
closed
to
scrutinized
and
found
to
be
reasonable
and
necessary
for
the
carrying
out
of
a
legitimate
state
purpose.
we
submit
that
this
is
a
legitimate
state
purpose,
that
is
the
separation
of
church
and
state.
it
is
recognized
likewise
that
state
cannot
be
arbitrary
in
attempting
to
accomplish
its
goals,
but
we
submit
there
is
no
arbitrary
action
in
this
case
and
a
criterion
for
different
treatments
must
bear
some
relevance
to
the
object,
the
object
being
the
separation
of
church
and
state
which
is
at
issue
here.
mr.
kenneth
r.
herrell
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not.
mr.
kenneth
r.
herrell
recall
that
to
our
attention
(inaudible),
i
am
not
aware
of
any
other
though.
now
we
move
onto
other
questions
that
have
been
raised
in
this
case,
that
is
a
question
of
equal
protection.
as
this
court
has
said
in
walker
there
is
no
fundamental
right
or
suspect
case
to
consider
in
this
case.
all
ministers
are
treated
and
like
in
similar
manner.
what
applies
to
one,
would
apply
to
all.
as
our
court
said
in
the
case
that
it
calls,
i
mean,
it
covers
priests
of
all
denominations
and
their
counterparts
in
other
religions.
mr.
kenneth
r.
herrell
but
if
we
consider
the
state’s
basis,
we
think
that
there
is
a
sufficient
basis
to
put
them
in
a
category
to
themselves
that
is
for
the
separation
of
church
and
state.
i
would
like
to
suggest
to
the
court
to
what
it
has
found
that
there
is
no
fundamental
right
to
hold
off
and
--
mr.
kenneth
r.
herrell
i
think
that
will
violate
one
of
their
religious
tennessee
where
they
had
a
right
to
worship
or
their
fundamental
belief
--
mr.
kenneth
r.
herrell
well,
i
think
that
that
would
be
in
the
same
category
that
we
have
before
us.
mr.
kenneth
r.
herrell
yes,
sir.
this
court
has
likewise
said
in
turner
that
there
is
no
fundamental
right.
mr.
kenneth
r.
herrell
no,
sir.
that
involves
their
fundamental
belief.
mr.
kenneth
r.
herrell
well,
in
first
place
--
mr.
kenneth
r.
herrell
well,
if
you
assume
that
premise
i
think
that
would
be
true
yes.
mr.
kenneth
r.
herrell
yes,
sir
it
is.
this
court
too
has
recently
said
in
the
williams
case
that
there
is
no
basis
for
a
claim
that
fundamental
as
a
political
right
for
association,
no
discriminations
against
a
group
and
in
connection
with
that
i
would
like
to
point
out
what
we
feel
the
court
defect
that
this
case
was
not
brought
as
a
class
action
to
the
attention
of
this
court.
there
is
no
assignment
made
on
that.
the
tennessee
supreme
court
said
that
there
was
not
a
class
action
involved
in
this.
now,
this
court
has
had
before
it
considerations
of
another
cases,
questions
of
whether
religious
organizations
or
rather
all
members
of
the
organization
entitled
to
the
exceptions.
again,
i
want
to
call
the
attention
to
the
fact
that
our
court
has
said
that
the
ministers
cover
all
beliefs
that
is
those
who
would
lead
their
people,
tech
them,
or
there
would
be
other
christian
religion
or
of
any
other
religion,
so
from
this
i
do
not
believe
it
can
be
said
that
you
have
a
question
of
vagueness
as
to
who
is
a
minister.
this
court
under
selective
service
acts
have
had
questions
about
ministers.
i
do
not
need
to
call
that
to
your
attention,
such
case
involving
dickinson,
and
as
a
group,
ministers
have
been
given
special
attention
or
special
privileges
namely
under
the
selective
service
act
for
instance.
they
are
exempt
from
service
under
the
selective
service
acts.
mr.
kenneth
r.
herrell
yes,
sir
and
likewise
we
have
certain
benefits
for
members
of
the
clergy,
such
as
benefits
from
our
federal
income
tax
provisions
not
including
all
of
their
income.
a
question
has
been
raised
here
as
to
whether
there
are
ministers
in
the
tennessee
general
assembly,
all
of
the
prisons
and
the
–
for
instance
in
the
prisons
in
the
state,
all
prisons
in
the
state
of
tennessee
have
ministers
to
serving
to
the
needs
of
the
inmates.
that
i
think
they
have
several.
mr.
kenneth
r.
herrell
yes,
sir.
mr.
kenneth
r.
herrell
so,
by
way
of
summary
and
conclusions
here
i
want
to
state
again
that
there
is
no
attempt
made
to
regulate
or
control
the
belief
of
anyone
in
the
tennessee
relative
to
what
they
can
believe
so
as
to
exclude
them
from
the
membership
as
a
minister.
mr.
kenneth
r.
herrell
to
my
knowledge
there
has
not
been
an
established
church
in
the
state
of
tennessee.
mr.
kenneth
r.
herrell
not
to
my
knowledge
and
in
the
law
state
of
franklin
was
an
initial
attempt
to
establish
a
state
in
the
state
of
tennessee
in
the
eastern
part.
that
particular
state
for
one
reason
or
another
gave
up
its
charter
and
reverted
back
as
a
part
of
north
carolina
and
then
a
later
attempt
was
made
to
establish
the
state
of
tennessee
which
was
then
except
--
mr.
kenneth
r.
herrell
no,
sir.
mr.
kenneth
r.
herrell
yes,
sir.
we
have
to
stand
and
say
that
ministers
if
they
are
those
as
to
find
in
the
tennessee
case,
which
on
attack
to
me
to,
i
mean
the
on
attack
to
minister
to
the
needs
of
their
congregations.
to
that
extent
they
would
be
included.
mr.
kenneth
r.
herrell
i
do
not
think
so
unless
--
if
as
long
as
he
would
be
in
that
category
or
he
would
on
attack
to
lead
some
of
the
people.
mr.
kenneth
r.
herrell
that
could
bring
a
very
difficult
decision
that
had
to
be
made
--
mr.
kenneth
r.
herrell
well,
i
think
you
might
even
say
impossible
to
the
extent
that
once
a
man
is
qualified
as
minister
and
has
those
believes
that
he
could
be
said
to
continue
those
in
his
thoughts
subconsciously.
mr.
kenneth
r.
herrell
and
be
excluded
yes
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
r.
herrell
well,
if
he
professes
to
be
methodist
and
does
not
adhere
to
this
religion
that
might
be
a
little
different
category.
mr.
kenneth
r.
herrell
yes,
sir.
mr.
kenneth
r.
herrell
that
is
what
i
am
trying
to
say,
yes
sir.
again,
i
want
to
summarize
this
very
briefly
to
say
that
there
is
no
attempt
made
to
regulate
the
belief
by
this
act.
there
is
no
attempt
made
to
regulate
a
practice
of
a
religion
by
the
act
that
is
in
question
and
there
is
no
denial
of
the
appellant’s
rights
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
all
ministers
and
their
counterparts,
all
religions
are
excluded
on
provisions
of
article
ix
section
1
of
the
tennessee
constitution.
there
is
no
fundamental
right
over
public
office.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
have
to
submit.
