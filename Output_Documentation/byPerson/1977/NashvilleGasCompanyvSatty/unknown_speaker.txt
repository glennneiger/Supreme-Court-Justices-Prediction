unknown
speaker
at
that
point
mr
wray,
had
she
been
taken
back,
then
would
she
regain
her
prior
seniority?
unknown
speaker
are
these
provisions
mr.
wray,
in
any
way
are
the
result
of
collective
bargaining
or
they
are
just
employer
policy
unilaterally
balanced?
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
know
and
the
record
does
not
show?
unknown
speaker
was
not
mrs.
satty
employed
for
a
brief
period
after
her
pregnancy
terminated
--
unknown
speaker
yes
but
did
she
have
any
job
bidding
rights
during
that
period?
unknown
speaker
well
it
is
not
clear
to
me
then
what
the
job
bidding
seniority
issue
really
is,
i
think
i
understood
you
to
say
you
did
not
know
whether
or
not
if
she
have
been
reemployed
that
she
will
have
seniority.
unknown
speaker
so
the
issue
here
relates
to
there
not
having
been
taken
back
at
all
on
a
permanent
basis?
not
being
able
to
bid
on
those
two
vacancies?
unknown
speaker
successfully?
unknown
speaker
she
was
not
employed?
unknown
speaker
mr
wray,
do
i
correctly
understand
that
she
not
only
did
not
receive
seniority
for
the
period
of
her
pregnancy
but
she
also,
because
she
lost
her
job,
there
lost
all
her
seniority
that
she
had
accumulated
up
till
the
time
of
the
--
unknown
speaker
mr.
wray,
enlighten
me
what
is
the
business
justification
for
the
deprival
of
seniority
rights?
unknown
speaker
oh
yes
but
the
distinction
is
between
one
who
is
absent
because
of
pregnancy
or
one
who
is
absent
for
other
types
illness,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
am
i
not
correct
that
had
she
been
out
because
of
appendicitis,
acute
appendicitis,
she
would
have
not
lost
her
seniority
rights?
unknown
speaker
why
according
to
district
court,
the
answer
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
question
is
yes,
she
would
have
retained
her
seniority,
she
would
not
have
lost
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wray,
may
i
ask
if
her
job
had
not
been
abolished,
she
would
have
filled
it
on
return
from
her
pregnancy
leave,
would
she?
her
old
job,
if
it
had
not
been
abolished.
unknown
speaker
and
she
without
seniority
could
not
have
bumped
that
person?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
you
said
that
this
loss
of
seniority
status
is
only
for
purposes
of
promotion,
or
bidding
for
a
job.
now
what
you
have
told
me
now
is
that
her
pregnancy,
she
lost
all
seniority
for
all
purposes
including
reinstatement
in
her
former
job,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
suppose
the
job
was
still
open,
i
gather
from
what
you
say
they
need
not
have
rehired
her,
after
her
pregnancy
leave.
they
could
have
filled
it
with
some
new
employee
from
outside,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
let
us
suppose
it
had
not
been,
i
know
you
that
is
what
you
said
if
it
had
been
put
up
for
bid
then
she
would
have
lost
it,
but
suppose
it
was
still
open.
unknown
speaker
but
if
no
one
else
had
bid
on
it,
it
was
still
open,
i
gather
you
are
telling
me,
she
would
have
got
it
back.
unknown
speaker
alright
now
suppose
she
had
been
in
there
for
another
year
then
she
wanted
to
bid
on
some
new
job
opening,
what
would
her
seniority
for
purposes
of
bidding
after
she
had
been
back
at
the
job,
another
year
be?
unknown
speaker
--
what
about
the
three
and
a
half
years
of
....
unknown
speaker
do
you
really
think
that
is
so,
that
the
record
does
not
show
or
that
you
say
that
the
answer
to
that
question
we
just
cannot
assume,
we
just,
it
might
be
one
way
or
might
be
the
other.
i
thought
she
simply
lost
her
seniority
for
a
job
bidding
purposes.
unknown
speaker
---
would
have
been
then
the
company's
interest
to
put
it
in
the
record
if
she
did
not
lose
her
seniority?
unknown
speaker
you
said
automobile
accident?
that
was
another
exception,
did
you?
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
injuries
suffered
in
the
automobile
accident,
without
question
were
entirely
the
employee's
on
grossest
kind
of
negligence?
unknown
speaker
from
the,
just
the
point
of
view
economic
self
interest
of
your
client,
the
employer
what
is
the
rationale
behind
this,
when
you
rather
have
an
experienced
employee
bidding
on
the
job,
than
a
less
experienced
one?
unknown
speaker
there
is
but
the
economic
self
interest
justification
will
be?
unknown
speaker
and
have
her
in
a
vacancy
rather
than
somebody
less
experienced,
would
not
it
be
the
employers
--?
unknown
speaker
they
did
not
get
pregnant.
unknown
speaker
was
that
for
example
or
is
that
just
it
an
educational
leave.
you
limited
the
physical
disability
to
heart
attack,
automobile
accident
and
one
other.
in
the
record
it
is
just
educational
leave,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well
you
are
talking
in
terms
of
what
the
company
would
have
done
or
what
the
company
was
obliged
to
do.
we
are
talking
about
the
rights
of
the
employee,
enforcible
rights
of
an
employee
here
not
what
the
company
might
give
them
as
a
matter
of
grace.
unknown
speaker
you
are
going
on
to
explain
why
including
pregnancy
would
cost
the
company
money?
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
--
in
order
to
back
pay
it
or
to
have
sick
leave
pay?
unknown
speaker
so,
how
would
it
cost
the
company
money?
unknown
speaker
there
is
a
limit
on
the
number
of
sick
leaves
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
how
about
as
compared
with
men
though?
unknown
speaker
the
argument
here
is
only
that
sex
discrimination.
that
is
the
whole
issue.
is
it
or
is
it
not?
and
it
seems
to
me
that,
do
not
you,
suppose
every
man
in
the
company
exceeds
his
sick
leave
every
year
and
none
of
the
woman
ever
did,
as
long
as
you
exclude
pregnancy.
unknown
speaker
but
to
say
that
it
would
cost
them
money,
at
least
must
assume
that
women
will
be
out
on
sick
leave
more
often
than
pregnancy
included
and
that
men
would
not
be
taking
so
much
sick
leave.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wray
may
i
ask
you
--
did
nashville
gas
discharge
a
woman
because
she
become
pregnant?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wray,
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
i
understood
you
had
answer
a
question
posed
by,
one
of
my
brother
in
the
earlier
to
the
effect
that
under
general
electric
if
the
evidence
showed
that
the
men
as
class
got
more
sick
leave
than
women
has
received
that
that
might
be
sex
discrimination.
is
that
so?
unknown
speaker
but
you
understand
general
electric
the
whole
if
review
of
the
fact
shows
that
one
sex,
members
of
one
sex
get
more
benefits
than
members
of
the
other
sex,
that
then
the
disfavored
sex
automatically
has
a
claim?
is
that
your
view
of
the
holding?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
follow
from
your
other
analysis
that
if
you
just
proved
that
more
leave
is
granted
to
males
and
females
or
vice-versa
is
discrimination
against
the
other
class.
it
seems
to
me
you
read
general
electric
that
way.
unknown
speaker
does
it
make
any
difference
how
the
allocation
of
benefits
actually
works
out?
is
that
relevant
at
all?
unknown
speaker
then
all
of
those
who
get
the
lesser
amount
always
have
a
claim.
then,
is
it
right?
unknown
speaker
you
seem
to
concede
that
if
such
evidence
represent
it
might
be
controlling.
unknown
speaker
where
is
the
burden
of
proof?
unknown
speaker
do
you
not
think
there
is
a
pretty
good
probability
that
the
benefits
do
in
one
way
or
the
other?
unknown
speaker
why
i
realize
that?
unknown
speaker
has
this
reflected
in
a
collective
bargaining
contract.
unknown
speaker
most
collective
bargaining
contracts
deal
with
seniority.
unknown
speaker
well,
was
she
in
the
unit
represented
by
a
union.
unknown
speaker
you
agree
with
your
friend's
statement
over
the
record
that
seniority
is
preserved
for
only
vacation
purposes
and
pension.
unknown
speaker
no
other
benefits?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
as
applicable
to
pregnancy.
this
case.
unknown
speaker
if
one
was
out
on
an
ordinary
sick
leave,
is
that
true?
unknown
speaker
only
pregnancy
leave?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
perhaps
not
all
that
clear.
at
least,
but
it
is
clear
with
respect
to
heart
attack
or
an
automobile
accident,
or
one
of
the
kind
of
disability
or
--
unknown
speaker
where
are
you
reading
from?
unknown
speaker
now,
where
is
that?
unknown
speaker
98?
bottom
of
98
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
pregnant
employee
required
to
leave
at
least
five
months
prior
to
the
expected
birth.
unknown
speaker
how
long
before
the
child's
birth
was
she
required
to
leave.
unknown
speaker
but,
that
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
mr.
weismueller,
can
i
ask
but
maybe
an
awfully
obvious
question
but
you
don't
seem
to
have
addressed
it
yet,
let
us
assume,
you
have
demonstrated
that
your
client
was
discriminated
because
she
got
pregnant.
unknown
speaker
and
let
us
assume
that
some
people
do
that
general
electric
case
holds
the
discrimination
against
people
who
get
pregnant
is
not
discrimination
on
account
of
sex.
if
you
make
those
two
assumptions,
how
can
you
win?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
it
did
hold
as
i
understand
it.
that
a
pregnancy
related
--
proving
a
pregnancy
related
discrimination
does
not
established
a
prima
facia
case
of
violation
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
now
how
do
you
establish
a
prima
facia
case?
unknown
speaker
but,
she
did
not
have
it
as
a
matter
of
right,
that
if
there
were
was
no
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
no
written
employment
contract,
she
had
it
as
a
matter
of
her
employer's
largess.
unknown
speaker
that
is
a
unilateral
manual.
this
is
no
collective
bargaining
agreement,
and
i
gather
no
individual
contractual
right,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
you
take
the
position
that
the
manual,
created
duties,
enforcible
duties
and
obligations
on
the
part
of
the
employee
and
conferred
corresponding
rights
on
the
employee,
enforcible
rights.
unknown
speaker
the
issue
is
the
application
of
title
vii.
unknown
speaker
and
that
makes
it
an
unlawful
employment
practice
for
an
employer
that
do
certain
things.
it
is
a
employer
conduct,
its
not
a
matter
of--
the
issue
here
is
whether
this
conduct
constitutes
a
violation
of
title
vii.
that
is
right.
this
does
not
depend
on
whether
the
union
contracts
or
written
contracts
or
anything
else.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words
is
not
the
employer
manual,
almost
irrelevant
here
except
as
it
shed
some
light
on
what
their
practices
were
as
distinguished
from
what
duties
they
have.
we
are
dealing
with
a
statutory
--
unknown
speaker
well
is
that
an
issue
here?
unknown
speaker
is
it?
i
mean
the
validity
of
that
question
--
factor
here
or
that
policy
here?
unknown
speaker
i
know
but
is
it
--
what
did
the
district
court
find
or
what
did
the
lower
court
find?
unknown
speaker
as
to
the
validity
of
that
practice
of
requiring
people
to
take
pregnancy
leave?
unknown
speaker
25
days
before
the
delivery.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
in
the
district
court,
you
challenged
that
requirement
as
arbitrary
and
violation
of
title
vii,
the
district
court
ruled
against
you.
unknown
speaker
and
held
squarely
that
does
not
appear
to
be
arbitrary--
unknown
speaker
and
you
did
not
bring
that
issue
in
there?
unknown
speaker
yes--
unknown
speaker
well,
issue
of
forcing
her
to
take
maternity
leave
is
not
here.
am
i
right?
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
then
your
answer
to
the
question
is,
if
the
company
had
a
flat
policy
of
not
employing,
it
would
be
violation
of
title
vii.
unknown
speaker
the
question
assumes
that
they
simply
have
the
policy
and
take
the
position
that
they
so
not
have
to
show
any
thing,
what
about
that?
unknown
speaker
you
are
talking
about
the
business
necessity
as
the
term
is
used
in
the
statute,
as
an
affirmative
defense.
unknown
speaker
the
general
electric
did
not
turn
on
that,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
mr.
weismueller.
unknown
speaker
are
you
going
to
address
the
sick
leave
policy
issue
you
devoted
your
argument,
for
this
point
i
think
to
the
seniority
issue.
unknown
speaker
i
am
particularly
interested
in
how
you
distinguish
general
electric
with
respect
to
the
sick
leave
issue?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
sounds
like
then
that
on
real
issues
who
has
got
the
burden
of
proving
this
matter,
the
record
does
not
show--
unknown
speaker
excuse
my
interruption.
unknown
speaker
well,
now
you
say,
possibly
i
thought
in
reading
your
briefs
that
you
had
conceded
that
if
we
sick
leave
aspect
were
here,
in
a
solitary
posture
gilbert
would
control.
am
i
mistaken
mr.
weismueller?
unknown
speaker
well
do
not
you
--
do
you,
do
you
or
do
not
you,
concede
that
if
pregnancy
were
included,
the
employer
would
be
paying
out
more
sick
leave
money
than
he
is
now.
forget
the--
unknown
speaker
forget
the
comparison
with
men
but
is
it
mainly
or
mainly
not?
unknown
speaker
so,
i
think
that
your
client,
your
client
at
least
had
not
used
all
her
sick
leave
--
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
your
point
is
that
seniority
continued
to
accrue
during
those
absences.
unknown
speaker
let
us
assume
that
without
including
pregnancy
that
the
benefits
for
men
and
women,
the
average
benefits
for
man
and
women,
sick
leave
benefits
for
man
and
women
in
terms
for
pay
are
about
equal.
let
us
us
assume
that
and
now
with
pregnancy
included
this
going
to
cost
a
employer
substantially
more
for
women.
now,
assuming
those
facts
would
you
still
argue
that
there
is
a
sex
discrimination
because
of
that
sick
leave
is
not
paid
to
women
for
pregnancy?
unknown
speaker
does
the
company
holds
jobs
open
and
grant
sick
leave
and
maintain
seniority
for
those,
for
example,
what
might
we
call
voluntary
surgeries,
a
cosmetic
surgery
or--.
unknown
speaker
did
the
district
court
make
any
findings,
i
am
impressed
both
from
your
opponents
arguments
and
yours
that
that
this
manual
is
less
than
precise
in
addressing
some
of
the
issues.
did
the
district
court
make
any
finding
on
that
point?
unknown
speaker
the
question
that
justice
white
asked,
whether
--
what
would
be
the
treatment
of
a
employee
who
undergoes
voluntary
cosmetic
surgery?
unknown
speaker
was
any
requested?
unknown
speaker
but
how
many
employees
are
there
in
this
company
about
from
its
title
it
looks
like
a--.
unknown
speaker
public
utility.
unknown
speaker
so
what
are
its
business?
unknown
speaker
and
sells
gas
itself?
unknown
speaker
was
not
the
entire
record
set
up
here,
it
may
not
have
been
printed?
