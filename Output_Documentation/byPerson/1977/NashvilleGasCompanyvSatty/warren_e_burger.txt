mr.

i

ready.
chief

warren
e.
burger
mr.
weismueller.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
she
object
to
--
did
she
challenged
their
--
the
leave
of
25
day
before
the
delivery?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
ask
you.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
ask
you
question
that
may
shed
some
light
from
me
at
least
on
your
basic
proposition.
what
if
a
company,
a
company,
a
employer
had
a
fixed
policy
of
not
employing
women
who
was
pregnant
at
the
time
she
applied,
would
that
violate
title
vii,
in
your
view?
you
seem
to
say
that
any
disparate
treatment,
because
of
pregnancy
is
violation
of
title
vii.
so,
what
about
my
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
not
you
think
it
would
have
been
helpful
to
the
court
if
the
manuals
have
been
made
part
of
the
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
understood
i
was
basing
my
question
on
the
proposition
that
it
was
not
put
in
evidence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
we
have
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

be

the
clerks
office.
chief
justice
warren

burger
