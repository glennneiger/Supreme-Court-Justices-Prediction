justice

she
could
not
have
vacation
when
she
was
working?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
that
the
only
penalty
was
on
job
bidding?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
mr.
wray,
before
you
get
away
from
this,
you
said
a
minute
ago
that
if
she
came
back
after
her
pregnancy,
“the
company
had
the
right
to
give
her
a
job
back”.
what
right
did
she
have?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
she
also
had
right
to
the
job
if
nobody
in
the
world
wanted
it
to,
did
not
she?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
other
right
did
she
have?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
it
was
available?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
the
end
of
her
rights?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
yet
if
somebody
was
out
with
illness
of
any
other
illness
other
than
pregnancy,
what
would
their
rights
be?
justice
thurgood
marshall
let
us
take
heart
attack.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
difference
the
reason
for
the
difference
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
two
people
that
could
not
work.
a
woman
delivering
a
baby
and
a
man
having
a
heart
attack.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they,
both
of
them
equally
cannot
work.
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
they
were
unable
to.
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
he
got
drunk
and
also
smoke
reefers
and
injected
heroine
and
as
a
result
crashed
his
car.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
wray,
on
strictly
money,
you
say
that
the
pregnant
woman,
when
she
comes
back
can
get
vacation
pay.
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
she
gets
the
vacation
pay.
yes
or
no?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
costs
the
company
money?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yet
if
they
give
her
a
job,
it
does
not
cost
them
any
money.
justice
thurgood
marshall
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
where
is
your
economic
argument?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
have
great
difficulty
in
your
statement
that
the
employer
made
her
take
leave.
she
had
to
take
leave
at
least
for
an
hour
or
so
did
she?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
do
you
keep
saying
that,
they
made
her
take
that
leave,
that
is
not
before
us,
no.
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
not
she
need
a
leave?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
do
you
keep
arguing
that
they
forced
her
to
take
a
leave?
