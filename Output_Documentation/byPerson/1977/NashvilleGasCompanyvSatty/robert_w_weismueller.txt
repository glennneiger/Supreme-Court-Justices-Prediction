mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
respondents
had
today
admitted
that
they
did
not
believe
that
they
should
fire
mrs.
satty
for
getting
pregnant.
they
believe
this
would
be
a
violation
of
title
vii.
we
believe
the
record
is
clear,
that
is
what
petitioner
did
and
as
a
fact
on
mrs.
satty
was
more
devastating
than
they
had
just
come
out
and
said
you
are
fired.
instead
they
constructively
terminated
her
and
made
it
very
hard
for
her
to
ever
get
back
to
nashville
gas
company.
their
policy
of
placing
pregnant
employees
on
pregnancy
leave
rather
than
sick
leave
had
the
following
effects.
it
caused
mrs.
satty
immediately
and
forever
and
i
believe
that
the
record
does
reflect
that
it
is
forever
that
mrs.
satty
would
lose
all
competitive
seniority
that
she
had
previously
earned.
in
the
affidavit
of
mr.
henson,
who
is
the
vice
president
for
personnel,
he
makes
the
very
clear
statement
that
an
employee
who
is
placed
on
pregnancy
leave
and
returns
to
permanent
employment
retains
seniority,
she
had
previously
cumulated
for
purposes
of
pension
vacation
but
does
not
retains
such
seniority
for
the
purpose
of
bidding
on
jobs.
there
is
no
qualifier
in
there
about
if
she
gets
the
job
back,
she
gets
her
seniority
back
or
anything
else.
i
think
that
we
can
take
this
plain
language
to
mean
that
this
is
gone
forever.
she
can
never
retain
the
seniority
if
she
is
lucky
enough
to
get
a
job
with
nashville
gas
company,
she
has
to
work
for
three-and-a-half
years.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
your
honor,
the
employee
manual
is
where
this
was
collective
bargaining
contract
was
never
made
a
part
of
the
record,
was
never
made
a
part
of
the
trial.
now,
whether
the
employee
manual
and
the
employee
policies
reflected
in
that--
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
they
do.
but
mrs.
satty
was
not
a
union
member.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
she
was
not.
once
mrs.
satty
returned
to
work,
after
the
birth
of
her
child,
she
was
placed
at
the
bottom
of
the
seniority
ladder.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out,
to
the
court
that
she
was
placed
at
the
bottom
of
the
salaries
ladder.
she
was
making
$
130.80
when
she
returned
as
opposed
to
$
140.80
when
she
left.
the
differences
can
be
seen
in
the
pay
scale
which
is
found
in
the
record
at
page
ninety
nine
of
the
appendix.
$
140.80
is
what
she
was
making
when
she
left
which
is
commensurate
with
her
seniority
that
she
had
at
that
time.
$
130.80
is
commensurate
with
entrance.
that
is,
she
started
over
again,
it
seems
to
us
from
the
record,
not
only
in
job
bidding
seniority
but
also
longevity
pay
raises
which
she
might
have
had
previously,
were
taken
away
from
her.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
yes
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
no
other
benefits.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
yes,
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
that
is
right,
if
one
returns
from
sick
leave,
not
only
does
one
retain
his
seniority,
but
actually
accrues
seniority
while
sick
and
if
there
are
any
across
the
board
pay
raises
during
the
time
that,
that
employee
is
absent,
they
are
entitled
to
--
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
well.
now,
the
company's
general
statement,
of
their
sick
leave
policy
is
that
when
employee
is
absent
because
of--
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
moh,
excuse
me,
page
96
of
the
appendix,
exhibit
one,
employee
policy
manual
sick
leave
and
pregnancy
leave
sections,
where
it
stakes
that,
when
an
employee
is
absent
because
of
illness
or
non-compensable
injury,
he
will
receive
pay
depending
upon
his
length
of
service
etcetera.
now,
there
are
no
qualifiers
there.
the
only
qualifier
is
in
a
separate
part
of
the
employee
manual,
where
they
talk
about
pregnancy.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
that,
let
us
pregnancy--
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
let
us
see.
yes,
bottom
of
98,
that
is
correct.
where
they
state
that
they
may
request
leave
of
absence
for
up
to
one
year.
however,
the
district
court
found
and
i
think
it
is
clear
from
the
testimony
that
there
is
no
requesting
to
it.
you
are
forced
on
pregnancy
leave.
the
only
request
involved
is
can
you
keep
these
few
illusory
rights
of
vacation
and
pension
for
that
year.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
that
is
the
written
policy,
however
that
is
not
as
the
company
implemented
in
this
case.
however,
the
company
did
reserve
the
right
to
be
the
final
arbiter
of
when
she
would
leave.
the
company
will
make
that
decision.
not
mrs.
satty.
not
mrs.
satty's
doctor.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
she
was
required
to
leave
25
days
prior
to
the
birth
of
the
child.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
that
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
think
we
are
factually
distinguishable
from
the
case
of
gilbert,
actually
under
the
holding
of
gilbert.
i
believe,
we
can
prevail.
gilbert
did
not
say
all
pregnancy
related
actions
of
an
employer
are
free
from
violation
of
title
vii.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
first
of
all,
by
showing,
that
there
was
no
business
necessity.
in
this
case,
there
was
no
business
reason
at
all,
as
there
was
in
the
gilbert
case.
secondly,
the
court
in
the
gilbert
case
held
that
there
was
an
even
handed
inclusion
of
risks.
that
is
all
risks
that
were
covered,
both
sexes,
could
claim
under
them.
once
these
risks
were
given,
they
were
never
taken
excuse
me,
these
benefits
were
given,
they
were
never
taken
away.
in
this
case
mrs.
satty
earned
seniority.
she
had
something.
and
it
is
taken
away.
there
is--
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
well,
i
believe
the
employee
manual,
your
honor,
would--
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
no,
there
was
no
individual
employment
contract
between
her
and
the
employer.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
we
take
the
position
that
if
they
have
a
policy
set
out
in
the
employee
manual
and
do
not
enforce
it
fairly
against
all
persons.
and
the
reason
they
do
not
enforce
it
fairly
is
because
of
sex.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
this
is
a
title
vii
case.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
in
that
focus,it
is,
yes.
also
they
change
mrs.
satty's
status.
in
violation
of
703
a2,
by
changing
her
status
from
one
with
three-and-a-half
years
seniority
to
one
with
no
seniority.
in
doing
that,
they
violated
title
vii
because,
the
whole
point
of
title
vii
is
to
protect
people
from
arbitrary
barriers
to
employment
or
chain
arbitrary
status
changes
which
are
a
barrier
to
employment.
and
we
maintain,
this
is
totally
arbitrary.
one
of
the
reasons
that
this
can
be
shown
to
be
arbitrary
is,
this
seniority
stripping
really
does
not
even
take
effect,
until
the
employ
is
ready
to
return
to
work.
when
she
is
a
healthy
employee
again
and
in
every
way
similar
to
a
male
who
has
broken
his
leg,
been
out
for
a
period
of
time
and
returned
or
any
other
employee
who
has
done
so.
finally,
we
should
see
that
twelve
women
have
been
forced
to
take
pregnancy
leave,
no
men
have
been
forced
to
take
pregnancy
leave
in
fact
no
other
employee
have
been
forced
to
take
pregnancy
leave.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
no.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
rwell
it
shows
impact
upon
one
group,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
as
to
what,
your
honor
i
am
sorry,
i
do
not
understand
the
question.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
of
requiring
them
to
take
pregnancy
leave,
it
was
no
problem.
but,
the
only
way
that
employee's
can
lose
seniority
is
by
either
taking
leave
of
absence
or
pregnancy
leave.
and
pregnancy
leave
is
the
only
situation
where
employees
are
forced.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
well
the
involuntary--
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
oh
yes
sir.
we
do
not
--
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
well,
this
is
the
only
situation
where
they
forced
her
to
lose
her
seniority
there,
possibly
i
should
state
it
that
way.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
the
record
shows
that
she
felt
like
she
had
recovered
sufficiently
to
come
back
to
work.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
yes,
she
was
out
for
five
days
with
water
retention.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
yes,
sir,
they
did.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
that
is
correct
but
in
turn--
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
no
sir,
we
did
not,
but
mr.
chief
justice
asked
me
if
she
--
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
i
understood
his
question
being
was
she
ready
to
come
to
work
that
time
and
yes,
she
was.
if
indeed
that
was
the
question.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
no,
we
are
not
objecting
today
to
the
--
forcing
her
to
take
pregnancy
leave.
what
we
do
object
is
forcing
her
to
lose
seniority.
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
well,
actually
it
was
triggered
at
the
time
that
she
left
under
their
policy.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
if
i
have
given
the
court
an
impression,
i
do
not
mean
to.
if
the
the
employer
can
show
a
valid
business
reason
for
not
employing
a
women
because
she
is
pregnant,
then
i
do
not
believe
that
violates
title
vii.
but,
if
they
can
show
no
business
necessity,
then
i
believe
that
it
would
be
violation
because
if
that
were
the
only
reason
they
did
not
employ
her.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
unless,
they
could
show
that
that
flat
policy
was
a
business
necessity--
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
then
i
believe,
that
would
be
a
violation
of
title
vii.
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
no,
because
the
court
never
found
effect.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
but
we
believe
that
here
in
changing
her
status,
we
have
shown
a
discriminatory
effect
that
is
they
have
strictly
because
of
her
sex,
changed
her
from
some
one
with
three-and-a-half
year
seniority
to
no
year
seniority.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
yes
sir.
as
to
the
sick
leave--
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
all
right
sir.
in
the
general
electric
case,
my
understanding
of
facts
are,
that
the
only
limitation
was
26
weeks
for
illness.
in
this
case,
the
policy
is
to
give
a
certain
amount
of
time.
it
depending
upon
the
seniority
that
you
have
for
sick
leave
after
which
you
have
no
further
sick
pay
benefits.
since,
there
is
a
finite
amount
of
time
that
can
be
taken
for
pregnancy
leave
and
only
that
amount
of
time
the
employer's
liability
is
limited
and
without
the
employers
showing
that
more
money
is
or
at
least
equal
money
is
given
to
limit
under
the
benefits
of
this
program.
then
i
do
not
believe
that
this
court
can
assume
that
equal
money
or
more
money
is
paid
to
women
and
then
that
as
i
understand
that
was
one
of
the
major
concerns
of
this
court
in
the
gilbert
case.
i
believe
that
if--
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
that
is
correct.
the
record
does
not
show,
your
honor
and
we
took
this
record--
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
also,
when
this
sick
leave
policy
is
viewed
in
the
overall
context
of
treatment
of
women,
we
maintain
that
this
is
just
the
first
stage,
in
an
overall
problem
of
discriminating
against
women
and
possibly
standing
by
itself
it
would
be
more
akin
to
the
gilbert
situation.
but,
when
taken
in
context
of
the
seniority
issue
we
believe
that
it
should
be
upheld.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
no
sir,
you
are
not
mistaken
that
is
in
the
brief.
we
have
rethought
the
questions
since
we
write
the
brief.
i
guess
is
my
basic
answer
to
that.
one
thing
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
before
getting
away
from
the
seniority
issue.
the
company
maintains,
that
it
also
may
put
some
one
on
sick
leave,
or
excuse
me,
leave
of
absence.
and
therefore
they
would
lose
seniority,
if
they
overran
their
sick
leave
but
this
is
just
simply
is
not
the
case.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
certainly
seven
hundred
and--
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
certainly
seven
hundred
and
eighty
something
dollars,
because
that
is
what
we
are
claiming
in
this
case,
if
this
court
should
find
that
pregnancy
should
be
included
in
the
sick
pay
and
certainly
they
are
going
to
be
added--
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
she
was
entitled
to
sick
leave.
however
the
case
of
mrs.
dixon,
i
think
is
very
instructive,
excuse
me,
is
very
instructive
as
to
company's
policy
toward
any
one
except
pregnant
women.
ms.
dixon
had
18
year
seniority
page
24
your
honor,
beginning
with
response
to
interrogatory
90,
ms.
dixon
was
absent
for
ten
months
essentially
in
one
period
and
then
another
period
of
five
months.
she
had
built
up
18
years
seniority
with
the
company.
as
a
result
of
that
she
would
have
been
entitled
to
23
weeks
sick
pay.
yet
upon
returning
to
work,
ms.
dixon
was
granted
seniority
from
the
date
of
hiring.
it
did
not
increase
from
the
time
she
was
gone
even
though
she
had
gone
well
beyond
her
sick
leave
which
was
allowed.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
yes
it
certainly
did
and--.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
your
honor,
under
the
holding
of
gilbert,
i
might
argue
that
i
do
not
believe
that
would
be
successful.
now
this
company
has
never
shown
business
necessity,
the
district
court
held
they
did
not
even
try
to
make
a
showing
of
business
necessity
for
the
seniority
stripping
policy.
it
was
only
in
their
reply
brief
to
this
court
which
we
received,
that
they
first
came
or
articulated
at
least
this
policy
of
–
well
we
want
to
reward
employees
who
stay
around
and
do
not
voluntarily
leave
to
do
other
things.
we
feel
that
that
simply
does
not
get
to
the
problem
because
an
employee
is
leaving
when
they
are
pregnant,
as
mr.
justice
marshall
pointed
out
is
not
because
they
want
to
go
it
is
because
they
have
got
to
go,
they
are
unable
to
work
and
also
the
company
in
light
of
its
sick
leave
policies
of
holding
jobs
open
for
very
long
period
of
time
for
people
who
are
out
has
shown
that
they
prefer
experienced
employees.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
although,
that
specific
question
cannot
be
found
in
the
appendix,
in
the
record,
their
statement
about
sick
leave
is
that
when
an
employee
is
absent
because
of
the
illness
or
non
compensable
injury,
now
with
that
qualifiers,
i
assume
that
that
would
be
covered,
if
there
were
to
be
any
qualification.
i
believe
the
burden
of
proof
would
be
upon
the
company
that
they
do
not
pay
for
voluntary
surgery
or
elective
surgery.
i
believe
that
the
burden
of
proof
would
be
theirs
not
ours
to
show
that.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
on
what
specification?
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
there
was
no
specific
finding
of
fact
on
that.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
no
your
honor,
there
was
not.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
350.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
300--
yeah,
it
is
mr.
wray
informs
me
350.
i
do
not
know
of
my
own
knowledge.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
its
business
is
the
installation,
maintenance
of
natural
gas
in
the
nashville
mid-tennessee
area.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
your
honor,
i
am
as
surprised
as
you
are
that
the
entire
manual
is
not
in
there.
when
we
made
up
the
appendix.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
the
entire
manual
was
put
into
evidence.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
i
do
not
believe
so,
i
checked
the
record
yesterday
and
i
believe
it
is
as
limited
as
what
we
have
here.
when
we
made
the
appendix
or
when
we
made
the
record
for
the
appeal
the
appellants
called
me,
i
honestly
do
not
remember
whether
we
agreed
that
it
should
all
be
in
there
or
not.
i
know
this
gentlemen--.
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
well,
the
record
i
checked
in
the
clerks
office
did
not
have
it
all.
i
hope
it
is
here
i
think
it
would
be
instructive,
certainly
we
would
be
we
have
copy
of
the
manual
and
would
be
happy
to
if
there
is
any
way
to
include
it.
be
happy
to
do
it
but
certainly
the
entire
employee
policy
manual
was
placed
in
the
evidence
in
the
district
court.h
mr.
robert
w.
weismueller,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
in
the
few
minutes
that
i
have
remaining
i
would
like
to
use
that
time
to
summarize
our
position.
in
striping
mrs.
satty
seniority,
the
gas
company
put
her
in
the
position
of
someone
beginning
new
with
the
company
as
far
as
what
we
consider
the
important
accruements
of
her
job
were.
she
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
seniority
scale,
she
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
pay
scale.
once
again,
even
though
she
had
worked
for
them
for
three-and-a
half
years,
this
work
meant
nothing
to
the
employer
once
she
was
placed
on
pregnancy
leave.
they
have
changed
her
status
from
an
employee
with
three-and-a-half
year
seniority
to
an
employee
with
no
seniority.
as
a
result
of
this
she
lost
three
jobs
which
she
bid
on
with
the
company.
the
company
concedes
if
she
had
had
her
previously
accumulated
seniority,
she
would
have
any
or
all
of
those
jobs.
she
would
presently
be
an
employee
of
nashville
gas
company.
such
a
change
of
status
is
permanent
we
believe
we
have
shown
under
the
facts
in
this
record
and
it
is
an
impediment
to
mrs.
satty's
ever
been
rehired
by
the
gas
company
and
if
she
is
rehired
to
her
whole
future
advent,
it
will
take
her
three-and-a-half
years
to
return
to
the
position
she
was
in,
prior
to
being
pregnant.
in
contrast
to
this
we
have
employees
who
are
sick
or
injured
and
out
for
considerable
lengths
of
time
in
excess
of
the
time
that
mrs.
satty's
was
out,
who
not
only
retained
their
seniority
and
their
rate
of
pay
but
actually
accumulate
seniority
while
they
are
on
their
sick
leave
and
if
any
across
the
board
raises
are
made
during
that
time
they
get
the
advantage
of
this.
all
of
this
was
done
by
nashville
gas
company
without
a
business
necessity
nor
a
reason
which
is
consistent
or
able
to
stand
logical
scrutiny.
they
claim
they
want
experienced
employees,
their
sick
pay
policy
shows
they
want
experienced
employees
and
yet
there
is
a
pool
of
experienced
employees
and
women
who
become
pregnant
that
they
for
no
apparent
reason
to
us
at
least
shun.
on
sick
leave
is
our
position
that
when
viewed
in
the
total
context
of
the
companies
entire
policies
toward
pregnant
women
it
is
discriminatory.
when
this
is
done,
when
you
look
at
this
policy
in
light
of
their
total
policy
toward
women,
you
see
that
this
is
just
the
beginning
step
in
the
total
policy
designed
to
discriminate
against
pregnant
women.
also,
since
there
are
finite
number
of
sick
days
and
it.
thank
you
for
your
time.
