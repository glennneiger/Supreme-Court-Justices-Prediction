mr.

supposing
that
mrs.
satty
instead
of
having
been
absent
for
pregnancy
had
a
heart
attack
and
had
then
come
back
to
the
company
after
the
same
period
of
time,
how
would
she
have
been
treated
differently
under
the
company's
policy,
i
get
the
impression
that
is
not
quite
as
precise
as
i
have
thought.
justice
william

rehnquist
assume
the
job
was
abolished.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
case
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
which
held
that
petitioner
nashville
gas
company's
employment
policies
relating
to
pregnant
employee's
violated
title
7
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
have
concluded
that
those
policies
insofar
as
they
relate
to
a
form
--
requiring
for
taking
of
a
formal
leave
of
absence
by
such
employees
do
--
in
seniority
policy
do
violate
title
7.
we
conclude
that
petitioner's
sick
leave
policy
is
legally
indistinguishable
from
the
disability
insurance
program
upheld
in
gilbert.
we,
however,
remand
this
to
that
aspect
of
the
case
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
determine
whether
the
respondent,
the
original
plaintiff
had
preserved
the
right
to
proceed
further
on
a
theory
that
the
petitioner's
sick
leave
policy
is
a
mere
pretext
for
discrimination.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
is,
therefore,
affirmed
and
part
vacated
in
part
and
remanded.
mr.
justice
powell
joined
by
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
marshall
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
