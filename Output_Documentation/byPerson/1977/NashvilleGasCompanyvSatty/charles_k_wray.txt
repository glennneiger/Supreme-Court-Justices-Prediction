mr.
charles
k.
wray
mr
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
here
today
representing
the
petitioner
nashville
gas
company
in
this
case.
this
case
present
for
consideration
by
the
court
the
question
of
whether
certain
employment
policies
of
the
nashville
gas
company
which
treated
pregnancy
differently
from
the
treatment
afforded
in
sickness
and
accident
constitute
unlawful
sex
discrimination
and
violation
of
title
vii
of
civil
rights
act
1964.
as
such
it
is
a
sequel,
i
believe
to
the
case
general
electric
company
versus
gilbert
decided
by
this
court
in
december
last
year.
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
against
my
client
on
the
issues
here
presented
essentially
on
the
grounds
that
since
only
women
became
pregnant
and
they
were
treated
differently
from
employees
suffering
from
sickness
and
accident.
generally
that
was
sex
discrimination,
unlawful
sex
discrimination.
i
submit
that,
that
rationale
was
rejected
by
this
court
in
the
general
electric
case,
both
the
lower
court
decisions
preceded,
this
court's
decision
in
general
electric.
thus
i
think
we
are
here
today
to
determine
whether
the
holding
and
the
underlying
rationale
of
general
electric
extend
to
the
factual
situation
presented
by
this
case
which
are
admittedly
somewhat
different
from
the
factual
situation
of
the
general
electric
case.
there
are
really
two
factual
circumstances
involved
here.
the
first
is
that
the
nashville
gas
company
has
a
sick
leave
policy
wherein
it
permits
employees
a
certain
number
of
days
of
absence
with
pay
from
covered
sickness
and
accident.
this
plan
differs
from
the
general
electric
plan.
in
that
seniority
is
an
element
of
the
number
of
sick
leave
days
to
which
the
employee
is
titled.
that
almost
is
not
present
in
general
electric.
also
the
gas
company
policy
has
a
specific
exclusion
for
illnesses
brought
about
by
the
employee's
willful
act.
in
this
case
mrs.
satty,
the
plaintiff,
had
been
an
employee
of
the
gas
company
for
several
years
at
the
time
she
became
pregnant
when
she
was
no
longer
able
to
work,
she
was
placed
on
pregnancy
leave
and
was
--
had
she
been
absent
as
a
result
of
sickness
or
accident
rather
than
pregnancy
she
would
have
been
paid
for
a
portion
of
the
time
that
she
was
absent
from
work.
the
other
factual
circumstantial
issue
here
is
the
company's
treatment
of
seniority
for
job
bidding
purposes
as
it
reflects
pregnancy
leave.
when
mrs.
satty
went
on
pregnancy
leave,
the
company
was
contemplating
converting
certain
of
the
clerical
functions
in
the
department
of
which
she
was
employed,
too
computive
and
as
a
consequence
it
was
decided
that
the
job
that
she
had
held
would
not
be
filled,
that
the
job
would
be
abolished.
thereafter,
when
mrs.
satty
was
able
to
return
to
work
after
the
birth
of
her
child,
she
was
given
a
temporary
job
by
the
company.
that
job
lasted
approximately
one
month
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
temporary
work
was
completed.
during
that
month
she
beared
on
three
permanent
job
openings
with
the
company.
now,
in
each
case
the
job
was
awarded
to
another
employee,
another
female
employee,
i
might
add.
his
initial
date
of
hire
was
more
recent
than
mrs
satty's
but
the
company
policy
was
such
that
when
you
had
been
absent
on
pregnancy
leave,
you
were
not
permitted
to
retain
your
previously
accumulated
seniority
for
job
bidding
purposes.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
your
honor,
the
record
does
not,
i
can
not
answer
that
question
and
i
do
not
think
it
is
reflected
in
the
record.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
the
record
does
not
reflect
that
and
i
am
not
sure
to
answer
mrs
satty
was
not
a
employee
covered
by
collective
bargaining
agreement.
they
are
certain
employees
of
the
company
who
are
and
i
do
not
know
to
what
extent
the
policy
as
applied
to
non
union
employees
might
be
the
same
as
negotiated
for
the
union
employees.
i
just
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
that
is
correct.
the
record
does
not
show
that.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
as
a
temporary
employee.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
well,
your
honor
i
am
not
sure
whether
in
that
context
her
seniority
would
run
from
the
date
her
temporary
work
started
or
not
but
the
people
who
were
awarded
the
permanent
jobs
in
preference
to
mrs
satty
had
their
employment
predated
of
the
time
of
her
temporary
work.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
well,
no
i
understood
mr
justice
blackmun's
question
and
perhaps
i
understood
it
was
had
she
gotten
back
a
permanent
position,
would
her
seniority
started
running
at
the
time
she
got
that
new
permanent
position
back
or
would
she
the
be
restored
on
a
previously
accumulated
seniority
and
that
is
what
i
said
is
not
clear
from
the
record.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
well
that
she
bid
successfully.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
yes
now--
mr.
charles
k.
wray
well
not
employed
in
a
permanent
position,
i
mean
she
was
bidding
on
those
position
while
she
was
in
this
temporary
status.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
for
job
bidding
purposes
your
honor
that
is
correct
but
she
did
not
lose
it
for
pension
and
vacation
purposes
but
the
job
bidding
purpose
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
when
she
went
on
the
pregnancy
leave
had
she
been
entitled
to
any
vacation,
heading
a
crude
vacation
at
that
time
would
have
been
paying
and
had
she
come
back.
i
think
she
have
been
an
employee
for
approximate
for
three-and-half
years
at
the
time
she
went
on
pregnancy
leave.
had
she
come
back
and
gotten
a
permanent
job,
the
vacation
to
which
she
would
have
then
been
entitled
would
have
been
based
on
those
three-and-half
years.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
rationale
underlying
that
policy
is
this.
i
think
it
is
rational
for
an
employer
to
have
a
seniority
policy.
think
such
a
policy
reward,
loyalty
and
continuity
of
service.
absences
are
disruptive
to
the
employer
and
need
not
be
encouraged
and
within
that
context,
i
think
it
is
rational
for
the
employer
to
provide
favored
treatment
for
those
persons
who
remain
on
the
job
rather
than
absenting
themselves
from
work
for
whether
it
is
to
pursue
additional
education,
to
take
another
job,
to
go
home
and
do
nothing
for
a
while.
all
those
people
who
--
mr.
charles
k.
wray
well
that
is
the
position
which
the
lower
courts
took
and
that
is
the
argument
of
the
respondent,in
this
case,
yes,
your
honor
but--
mr.
charles
k.
wray
alright,
your
honor,
the
only,
this
policy
in
this
respect
is
not
a
written
policy
and
i
do
not
really
mean
to
suggest
that
the
answer
to
that
question
is
that
she
would
have
lost
it,
but
the
only
examples
in
the
record
of
absences
which
are
permitted
without
loss
of
seniority
are
be
that
heart
attack,
back
trouble
and
automobile
accident.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
i
think
that
is
a
fair
inference,
yes
sir,
i
am
just
saying
that
appendicitis
does
not
happen
to
be
one
of
the
examples
covered
in
the
record
and
this
is
not
pursuant
to
a
written
statement
policy.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
i
am
not
sure
of
the
answer
to
the
question
your
honor,
they
might
have
put
the
job,
they
did
not
regard
themselves
as
obligated
to
hold
a
job
open,
so
even
if
it
were
a
job
that
would
not
being
abolished
it
might
have
been
put
for
bidding
and
presumably
someone
else
during
her
absence
or
after
her
return
to
temporary
status.
if
it
had
been
put
up
for
bidding
someone
else
might
well
have
gotten
it.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
the
position
of
the
company
is
i
believe
your
honor
that
when
an
employee
goes
on
a
pregnancy
leave,
educational
leave,
some
form
of
personal
leave
the
company
does
not
necessarily
hold
the
job
open.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
no
your
honor,
if
at
the
time
she
was
able
to
return
to
work,
that
job
was
open
and
had
it
been
put
for
bid
if,
some
other
employee.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
excuse
me,
you
honor,
if
it
was
still
open
i
assume
the
company
has
a
right
simply
to
put
her
back
in
that
position
and
without
any
bidding
but
if
it
had
been
put
up
for
bids,
i
want
to
make
this
point
very
clear
she
would
have
been
given
priority
over
a
non
employee,
i
think
that
is
a
very
important
distinction,
now
if
some
person
already
employed
with
the
company
were
bidding
on
it,
presumably
--.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
yes
your
honor.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
it
would
be
at
least
a
year
and
this
goes
back
--
mr.
charles
k.
wray
your
honor,
the
record
does
not
reflect
whether
her
previously
accumulated
seniority
would
have
been
restored
had
she
gotten
a
permanent
position
or
not.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
i
have
had
the
question
asked
to
me
before
and
i
did
not
know
the
answer.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
proceeding
with
the
question
of
the
rationale
underlying
this
policy
--.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
your
honor,
she
would
be
given
preference
over
persons
who
had
not
been
employed
by
the
company.
in
other
words
if
there
was
a
job
there
and
she
wanted
it
and
there
was
someone
who
had
never
been
employed
by
the
company
who
wanted
it,
mrs.
satty
would
have
gotten
the
job.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
she
had
the
previously,
that
she
retained
her
seniority
for
vacation
and
pension
purposes
and
she
did
have
the
right,
she
was
given
preference
of
temporary
work
when
it
was
available.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
yes
as
it
was
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
i
believe
that
is
all
that
occurred
to
me,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
your
honor,
in
so
far
as
all
the
other
illnesses
were
heart
attack,
back
trouble
automobile
accident
the
person
--
mr.
charles
k.
wray
okay
we
take
the
heart
attack,
that
person
would
come
back
and
presumably
the
company
would
endeavor
to
restore
that
person
to
the
former
position
if
it
was
available,
if
not
to
give
him
a
comparable
position
and
it
would
let
him
retain
that
previously
accumulated
seniority
for
job
bidding
purposes.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
the
reason
for
the
difference
is
your
honor,
i
think
explaining
what
i
had
feel
to
to
be
rationale
underlying
a
seniority
policy
that
is
to
encourage
continued
employee
attainment.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
i
think
the
difference
your
honor
is
why
were
they
not
on
the
job
working
and
i
submit
that
the.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
well
but
i
submit
that
the
person
who
has
had
the
heart
attack,
has
been
subjected
to
a
essentially
involutorial,
unfortunate
accident,
i
submit
that
it
is
fair
to
assume
that
that
employee
would
rather
be
on
the
job
than
in
the
hospital
retaining
seniority
with
a
heart
attack
and
i
think
that
distinguishes
it
from
pregnancy
which
i
submit
is
essentially
a
voluntary
condition,
it
is
subject
to
the
control
of
the
employee
both
before
and
after
the
fact
of
conception
and
i
submit
it
reflects
an
employee
sense
of
values,
priorities
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
where
in
the
employee
as
in
the
case
of
pregnancy
exulting
her
personal
life
choice
decision
above
the
interest
of
the
employer
having,
the
interested
employee
being
to
have
person
stay
on
the
job
and
be
absence.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
oh
yes.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
your
honor
even
viewed
as
a
gross
negligence
situation,
i
still
do
not
think
it
is
something
that
employee
would
ever
say,
he
intended
it
to
have
it
happen
and
i
think
that
distinguishes
it
from
pregnancy.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
i
submit
that
that
is
significantly
different
from
typical
pregnancy
and
that
it
is
something
that
the
employee
would
not
choose
or
intend
to
have
happen
and
i
do
not
think
the
same
can
be
said
of
pregnancy.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
i
do
not
think
there
is
no
cost
justification
at
least,
readily
identifiable
in
this
case
as
there
is
in
general
electric
--.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
well
i
cannot
put
in
dollars
and
cents
terms,
i
think
the
interest
is
having
these
employees
continue
on
the
job
without
absenting
themselves
for
reasons
to
personal
preference.
now
within
that
framework,
the
gas
company
does
provide,
a
person
like
mrs.
satty
has
experience
which
is
valuable
to
the
company
and
i
would
submit
that
it
is
in
the
company's
interest
to
have
her
return
to
work
and
i
submit
the
company
offers
certain
incentives.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
well
no
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
so,
i
mean
they
are
for
the
incentives,
namely
temporary
work,
crude
seniority
of
vacation
and
pension
and
most
important
priority
over
non
employees.
i
think
that
is
an
incentive
where
by
the
company
would
try
to
take
benefit
of
that
prior
valuable
experience
but
the
company
is
not
going
to
extend
that
incentive
at
the
expense
of
those
employees
who
have
stayed
on
their
jobs--
mr.
charles
k.
wray
right.
it
is
stipulated
here
for
example
that
this
is
the
same,
the
pregnancy
treatment
is
the
same
treatment
that
would
be
afforded
to
someone
who
had
taken
an
educational
leave
for
example.
they
would
come
back
with
preference
over
non
employees
--
mr.
charles
k.
wray
i
believe
that
is
the
only
other
type
of
leave
where
they
have
had
employees
go
out
for
that
reason
--
mr.
charles
k.
wray
when
she
came
back,
i
think
the
company
first
endeavored
to
keep
the
job
open
for
her.
if
they
were
--
i
am
getting
away
from
situation
where
the
job
is
abolished.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
okay,
i
think
she
would
have
come
back
and
she
would
have
had
retained
her
previously
accumulated
seniority
for
job
bidding
purposes
and
one
of
those
three
jobs
on
which
she
bid
came
up,
she
would
have
been
awarded
the
job.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
well,
i
think
the
answer
is
that
it
would
be
the
company
policy
to
endeavor
to
do
what
i
have
said.
i
think
an
answer
to
some
interrogatories
that
are
in
the
record
the
company
tried
to
take
the
position
and
i
think
probably
they
were
not
obligated
to
so,
but
that
was
in
their
policy,
not
in
any
contractual
sense
but
just
in
a
practical
factual
sense,
that
is
what
would
have
happened.
i
would
like
also
to
address
in
little
more
detail,the
absence
of
the
cost
justification
which
is
already
been
cited
in
the
opposing
briefs
and
has
been
brought
by
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
think
the
difference
in
these
treatment
of
pregnancy
on
the
one
hand
and
these
other
accidents
and
illnesses
we
have
identified
on
the
other
hand
is
basically
that
the
company
i
submit
rationally
views
pregnancy
differently
from
sickness
and
accident
and
i
submit
that
this
court
explicitly
did
the
same
thing
in
the
general
electric
case.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
not
in
the
seniority
context.
no,
i
am
trying
to
say
why
i
do
not
think
the
absence
to
that
justification
is
material.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
well,
your
honor,
briefly
on
the
question
of
sick
leave
pay,
i
think
general
electric
is
clearly
controlling,
the
only
difference
is
--
mr.
charles
k.
wray
they
would
be
permitting
more
days
of
absence.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
yes,
your
honor,
but
the
only
situation
in
which
you
can
envision
that
it
would
not
cost
the
company
more
to
cover
pregnancy
is
if
you
assume
that
every
woman
who
became
pregnant
would
have
used
up
all
of
her
sick
leave
days
for
other
reasons.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
the
extent
to
which
men
as
a
group
receive
sick
leave
days--
mr.
charles
k.
wray
your
honor,
i
think
that
general
electric
would
have
called
that
a
disparate
impact
that
would
be
sex
discrimination
based
on
effect
or
impact
and
there
is
simply
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
the
effect
of
the
company's
policy
was
to
give
men
more
days
absence
with
pay
than
women.
i
think
it
is
directly
analogous
to
the
analysis
in
general
electric
in
that
respect.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
well,
to
me
there
is
no
--
there
are
two
points.
i
think
that
if
you
covered
pregnancy
where
you
had
not
covered
it
before,
you
would
be
paying
more
sick
leave
than
previously
unless
you
assume
that
women
already
use
up
all
of
their
sick
leaves
for
other
reasons.
now,
as
to
whether
not
withstanding
what
happens
to
the
women
if
the
men
somehow
get
more
benefits
out
of
this
plan
it
would
be
sex
discrimination,
but
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
men
get
more
benefit
out
of
the
plan.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
she
retains
her
seniority
for
--
mr.
charles
k.
wray
your
honor,
when
she
comes
back
she
is
treated
as
having
a
three-and-a-half
years
of
service
and
is
then
entitled
to
whatever
vacation.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
that
is
right.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
well
let
me
answer
it--
mr.
charles
k.
wray
it
does
not
cost
them
the
seniority
--
mr.
charles
k.
wray
your
honor,
as
applied
to
seniority
for
job
bidding
purposes
i
do
not
think
it
is
an
economic
argument.
we
pay
the
women
who
go
on
pregnancy
leave
accumulated
vacation
time
for
example.
now,
if
we
did
not
do
that,
we
could
stand
up
here
and
say
we
have
cost
justification.
the
only
way
we
can
correct
that
policy
on
--
change
that
policy
as
it
applies
to
seniority
for
job
bidding
purposes
is
not
by
absorbing
any
additional
cost
to
ourselves.
we
can
only
do
it
by
penalizing
those
other
employees
who
choose
not
to
go
on
pregnancy
leave
or
cannot
because
of
biological
reasons
be
pregnant.
if
viewed
in
that
way
i
think
there
is
even
less
reason
to
infer
any
pretext
in
this
situation
than
there
would
be
if
we
could
set
up
here
with
a
dollars
and
cents
justification.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
no,
your
honor
i
do
not
believe
that
could.
i
am
not
saying
that,
that
would
necessarily
be
unlawful,
but
the
rationale
for
our
seniority
policy
which
i
have
advanced
here
today
would
not
support
a
termination
and
i
think
these
facts
are
different
in
which
she
clearly
has
priority
over
non
employees
coming
back
i
think
that
distinguishes
it
from
the
termination
situation.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
i
do
not
know
that
it
would
necessarily
go
to
that.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
well,
i
have
read
the
proof,
and
well,
i
do
not
know
the
proof
in
general
electric
got--
mr.
charles
k.
wray
i
would
say
it
is
relevant.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
i
really
have
not
dealt
the
question
through
to
that
point.
i
submit
that
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
case
that
these
policies
provide
more
benefits
to
men
as
a
group
than
to
women
as
a
group.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
i
would
concede
if
there
was
evidence
that
women
as
a
group
were
receiving
less
benefit
from
the
plan
that
under
general
electric
that
might
be
important.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
i
think
general
electric
very
clearly
says
that
the
burden
is
on
the
plaintiff.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
not
anymore
than
it
would
had
been
in
the
general
electric
case.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
charles
k.
wray
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
submit
that
the
the
general
electric
case
controls
here.
general
electric
stands
for
the
proposition
that
a
distinction
based
on
pregnancy
is
facially
neutral
it
is
not
per
se
sex
discrimination.
it
may
nevertheless
be
unlawful,
if
the
effect
of
the
policy
is
to
have
disparate
impact
on
women
as
a
group
as
opposed
to
man
as
a
group.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
that
fact
and
the
plaintiff
has
the
burden
of
proof
on
that
point.
it
may
also
constitute
unlawful
sex
discrimination
if
the
policy
is
not
in
fact
a
pregnancy
policy
but
a
men
versus
women
policy
if
it
is
a
subterfuge,
if
it
is
not
what
it
appears
to
be
on
its
face,
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
this
policy
is
anything
other
than
a
straightforward
pregnancy
policy
and
there
is
nothing
to
suggest
that
the
burden
of
proof
has
been
shifted
from
the
typical
position
of
that
burden
being
on
the
plaintiff
and
civil
litigation.
and
for
all
of
these
reasons,
i
submit
that
the
ruling
of
court
of
appeal
should
be
reversed
and
the
case
dismissed.
