these
days,
is
there
any
termination
date
on
the
trust
property?
justice

there
used
to
be.
justice

indefinitely.
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
that
it
were
possible
that
there
would
be
a
difference
between
a
crime
committed
on
a
trust
property
and
off
trust
property,
but
still
on
the
reservation
or
difference
between
a
crime
committed
against
the
tribe
itself
and
not
against
the
tribe
itself.
for
instance,
trespass
on
tribal
property.
do
you
think
the
tribe
could
prosecute
somebody
for
that
even
though
they
might
not
be
able
to
prosecute
for
assault
and
for
a
misdemeanor
in
some
bar
somewhere?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
somebody
does
not
exclude,
supposing
comes
on
anyway
and
there
is
a
tribal
--
there
is
a
tribal
regulation
that
says
anybody
who
trespasses
on
our
property
has
to
pay
$500.00,
then
what
are
you
going
to
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
has
it
ever
held
that
it
could
not
be
found
some
place
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
i
guess
your
answer
is
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
are
submitting
that
--
is
your
submission
that
congress
has
in
effect
past
the
statute
or
several
of
them
that
says
there
is
no
such
thing
as
retain
power?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
your
position.
i
am
just
trying
to
find
out
where
you
found
the
law
on
that.
you
just
picked
that
out
of
the
air
somewhere
or
are
you
saying
that
congress
in
affect
has
a
statute
which
says,
no
retain
power
and
that
the
tribe
may
exercise
only
such
powers
over
non-indians
as
you
can
find
in
a
statute
or
treaty?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
not
just
suggesting
that
congress
has
said
that
there
is
a
law
some
place
that
some
constitutional
principle
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
the
same
thing
about
that
tribal
sovereignty
over
indians?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
can
you
just
answer
yes
or
no,
do
the
cases
or
the
congress
recognized
some
sort
of
retained
inherent
power
of
the
tribe
over
indians?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
ernstoff
there
is
no
conflict
between
the
position
of
your
client
and
the
position
of
the
amicus.
