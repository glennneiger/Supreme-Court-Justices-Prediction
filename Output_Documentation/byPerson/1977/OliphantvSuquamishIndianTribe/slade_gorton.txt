mr.
slade
gorton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
one
remark
mr.
justice
powell
on
your
factual
question.
in
each
case,
these
petitioners
were
jailed
in
state
facility,
city
jails
in
bremerton
and
port
angeles
pursuant
to
contracts
between
those
cities
and
the
federal
government.
mr.
slade
gorton
yes
sir.
at
the
outset,
it
is
well
the
note,
the
extensive
scope
of
respondents'
claim
that
the
tribe
has
jurisdiction
to
try
non-citizens,
in
this
instance
under
its
laws
even
though
they
may
not
participate
in
making
those
laws,
derived
principally
from
the
tribes
retained
inherent
powers
of
government
which
is
unlimited
except
as
expressly
qualified
by
treaty
or
a
statute.
mr.
slade
gorton
i
believe
--
mr.
slade
gorton
yes,
on
a
residential
basis
mr.
chief
justice.
if
he
went
to
idaho
he
could
become
a
citizen
of
idaho
on
that
day
under
your
decision
and
then
dun
v.
romanson.
for
example
there
is
no
duration
--
mr.
slade
gorton
that
is
true,
but
these
two
persons
are
both
residents
of
the
reservation
over
which
the
tribal
jurisdiction
was
asserted.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
respondents’
brief
offers
no
source
for
the
power
asserted
here
other
than
retained
inherent
sovereignty.
the
solicitor
general
presents
the
same
broad
claim.
the
tribal
jurisdiction
here
asserted
is
an
aspect
of
residual
tribal
autonomy
which
can
only
be
last
by
the
terms
of
the
treaty
of
statute.
mr.
slade
gorton
that
is
exactly
where
i
propose
--
mr.
slade
gorton
it
is
a
statute
or
a
treaty.
this
court
has
rejected
the
analysis
which
respondents
of
the
united
states
present
here.
it
has
never
authorized
any
exercise
of
indian
jurisdiction
over
the
personal
property
of
a
non-indian
based
on
the
platonic
notion
of
severity,
to
quote
mr.
justice
marshall
on
mcclanahan.
this
court
has
upheld
indian
claims
to
tribal
jurisdiction
over
non-indians
only
when
the
authority
for
the
assertion
can
be
found
under
the
specific
treaty
provision
or
statute
and
of
course
that
is
exactly
the
positions
which
we
are
taking
here.
mr.
slade
gorton
it
has
always
been
very
careful
to
avoid
basing
the
finding
on
sovereignty.
mr.
slade
gorton
yes,
my
answer
is
no.
to
our
knowledge,
there
have
been
only
three
cases
in
which
this
court
countenance
even
a
modest
claim
of
indian
jurisdiction
over
non-indian
activities.
and
in
each
of
these
cases,
the
court
used
the
mcclanahan
approach,
finding
the
source
in
either
a
treaty
provision
or
statute.
in
morris
v.
hitchcock
in
1904,
this
court
found
to
be
valid
legislation
of
the
chickasaw
nation
levying
a
permit
tax
on
horses
and
cattle
owned
by
non-indians,
but
grazing
on
chickasaw
land.
the
court
found
the
authority
for
the
tax
lay
both
in
the
curtis
act
and
the
treaty
under
which
the
chickasaws
has
held
their
lands.
but
note,
even
so,
even
under
those
circumstances
where
they
are
highly
organized
the
indian
government,
the
sanction
for
failure
to
pay
the
tax
was
an
expulsion
from
the
reservation
by
federal
officials,
not
a
criminal
prosecution
in
the
chickasaw
tribal
court.
in
williams
v.
lee
--
mr.
slade
gorton
yes,
this
was
oklahoma
while
it
was
indian
territory.
in
williams
v.
lee,
this
court
prohibited
a
licensed
indian
trader
on
the
navajo
reservation
from
suing
his
indians
debtor
in
a
state
court
leaving
him
to
pursue
his
claim
if
he
chose
to
do
so
in
the
navajo
tribal
court.
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
that
court
was
found
to
rest
on
the
1868
treaty
between
the
united
states
and
the
navajos
and
finally
in
the
united
states
v.
mazurie
you
validated
an
explicit
statutory
delegation
by
congress
of
its
power
to
control
on
reservation
tavern
licensing
to
the
resident
indian
tribe,
but
the
mazuries
were
convicted
of
the
violation
of
a
federal
statute
in
a
federal
district
court.
they
were
not
before
a
tribal
court
charged
with
a
violation
of
a
tribal
ordinance.
moreover,
this
consistent
view
of
this
court,
the
claims
of
residual
sovereignties
standing
alone
are
not
sufficient
grounds
to
support
a
claim
of
tribal
jurisdiction
over
non-indians
has
been
matched
step
for
step
by
the
congress
and
the
executive.
in
1834,
immediately
after
the
passage
of
the
trade
and
intercourse
act
of
that
year,
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
expressed
his
view,
the
congress
passed
that
law
“on
the
assumption
that
under
the
treaties
indian
laws
would
be
applicable
only
to
indians
themselves."
the
same
opinion
takes
the
position
that
for
such
authority
to
exist
in
an
indian
tribe
it
must
be
given
by
the
united
states.
no
article
legislative
history
of
the
1834
act
proceed
from
any
other
assumption.
its
clear
implication
is
that
either
the
united
states
or
the
tribe
might
have
jurisdiction,
but
not
both.
the
congress
elected
federal
jurisdiction
over
non-indians.
in
1854,
the
congress
reinstated
the
treaty
exception
in
its
present
form.
mr.
slade
gorton
it
is
our
position
that
the
law
of
the
united
states
is
that
the
indian
tribes
must
show
their
right
to
try
non-indians
either
in
a
treaty
(voice
overlaps).
mr.
slade
gorton
i
am
stating
that
the
congress
has
stated
that
there
is
no
indian
power
to
try
the
non-indians
in
these
cases.
(voice
overlap).
mr.
slade
gorton
i
am
stating
two
separate
propositions
that
this
court
consistently
has
held
that
the
indian
powers
over
non-indians
must
be
found
in
treaty
or
statute.
in
addition
to
that,
i
am
saying
that
the
trade
and
intercourse
acts
rather
explicitly
denied
that
right
and
put
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
this
kind
of
activity
in
the
united
states
at
the
time
of
those
acts,
but
the
attorney
general
of
united
states
at
the
time
of
trade
and
intercourse
acts
took
exactly
that
position
on
two
different
occasions
and
that
the
courts
of
the
united
states
said
(voice
overlap)
mr.
slade
gorton
that
mr.
justice
white
is
a
very
interesting
question
which
of
course
is
not
directly
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
slade
gorton
there
is
only
one
case
in
which
this
court
has
even
remotely
based
its
decision
on
the
retained
tribal
jurisdiction
even
over
tribe
or
members
in
talton
v.
mayes.
even
there,
the
power
to
try
the
indians
in
the
first
place
seems
to
stem
from
a
treaty.
whether
or
not
this
court
would
continue
that
view
even
as
the
indians
i
think
is
a
moot
question.
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
19th
century
mr.
justice
harlan
decided.
he
might
have
been
as
prophetic
on
that
as
he
was
in
plessy
v.
ferguson.
in
any
event,
the
jurisdiction
of
the
indians
to
try
indians
maybe
found
in
the
trade
and
intercourse
act
which
explicitly
states
that
the
united
states
in
effect
recognizes
the
right
of
the
indian
tribes
to
try
the
non-indians.
mr.
slade
gorton
exactly
and
in
addition
there
is
another
statutory
scheme
in
connection
with
these
reservations
in
the
state
of
washington
which
i
suspect,
but
do
not
know,
is
paralleled
in
most
other
western
states.
the
sovereignty
of
the
united
states
over
the
area
which
is
now
the
state
of
washington
under
the
concepts
of
sovereignty
which
have
always
been
accepted
in
western
country,
in
western
civilization
in
the
united
states
came
from
explorations
beginning
with
those
of
robert
gray
and
from
a
series
of
treaties,
the
louisiana
purchase
treaties
with
spain
and
great
britain
culminating
in
the
treaty
with
great
britain
of
1846
under
which
we
settled
the
northwest
frontier
of
the
united
states.
at
that
point,
the
united
states'
claim
to
the
sovereignty
over
the
washington
area
was
total,
absolute
and
complete.
moreover,
two
years
later,
the
united
states
organized
that
area
into
the
oregon
territory
and
the
oregon
territory
statute
says
on
this
subject
“nothing
in
this
act
shall
be
construed
to
impair
the
rights
of
persons
or
property
now
pertaining
to
the
indians
and
said
territory
so
long
as
such
rights
shall
remain
unextinguished
by
treat,
rights
of
person
or
property.
now,
does
this
mean
that
the
united
states
recognized,
this
is
before
and
even
the
indian
treaties
were
signed,
criminal
jurisdiction
by
the
indian
tribes
over
non-
indians
unlimited
and
subject
matter
in
geography
except
by
the
borders
of
the
washington
territory,
i
think
that
state
that
questions
answers
it.
it
means
exactly
the
opposite.
that
the
united
states
recognized
in
the
indians
no
powers
except
rights
of
person
or
property
which
themselves
depended
on
that
oregon
territory
statute.
all
else
was
subsumed
into
the
sovereignty
of
the
united
states.
in
1854,
when
the
trade
and
intercourse
act
was
passed
in
its
present
form,
at
least
for
the
purposes
of
this
argument
here
today,
the
united
states
withdrew
from
federal
jurisdictions
a
certain
authority
to
prosecute
both
indians
and
none
indians
where
a
tribe
held
exclusive
jurisdiction
and
i
am
quoting
now
“by
treaty
stipulations.”
later
in
that
same
year,
1854,
in
full
knowledge
of
this
provision,
the
united
states
presented
the
treaty
of
point
elliott
to
this
suquamish
indians.
that
treaty
contained
no
treaty
stipulations
conferring
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
non-indians
to
the
tribe.
and
the
next
year,
in
1855,
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
re-stated
his
early
opinion
that
indian
tribes
may
receive
jurisdiction
over
non-indians
only
from
congress.
in
1878,
a
circuit
court
at
ex-party
canyon
held
that
the
federal
statue
limited
tribal
court
jurisdiction
to
offenses
by
indians
against
indians.
now,
from
that
point
on,
1878,
at
the
latest,
the
judiciary,
the
congress
and
the
executive
were
in
complete
agreement.
as
late
as
1970,
the
solicitor
of
the
department
of
the
interior
adhered
to
the
same
conclusion.
indian
tribes
do
not
have
criminal
jurisdiction
over
non-indians.
true
that
opinion
was
withdrawn
in
1974,
but
not
until
the
solicitor
general’s
brief
in
this
case
has
the
federal
government
ever
expressed
a
contrary
review.
now,
what
has
happened
as
a
result
of
that
view,
in
reliance
on
these
consistent
longstanding
views,
literally
tens
of
thousands
of
united
states
citizens
had
purchased
land
and
settled
on
indians
reservations
in
full
confidence
that
they
have
not
waived
their
rights
to
self-government
and
to
participation
in
the
administration
of
their
criminal
justice
systems.
it
seems
to
us
far
too
late
on
the
day
now
at
least
in
the
absence
of
a
clear
declaration
of
congressional
intent
to
the
united
states
to
tell
these
citizens
that
it
was
wrong
and
that
they
are
in
the
situation
of
any
one
living
in
a
foreign
country
“precisely
the
extraordinary
submission
of
the
solicitor
general
in
this
case.”
not
only
a
foreign
country,
but
a
foreign
country
in
which
they
can
never
become
naturalized
citizens.
these
citizens
have
not
chosen
to
live
in
a
foreign
country
and
they
do
not
do
so
now.
they
live
in
the
united
states
and
they
are
subject
to
its
laws.
mr.
slade
gorton
precisely
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
am
not
--
mr.
slade
gorton
but
i
do
not
believe
that
you
need
to
do
that.
i
am
not
here
as
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
arguing
for
state
jurisdiction.
i
am
here
arguing
against
this
assertion
of
jurisdiction
under
the
mcbratney
exception
if
the
crime
does
not
involve
indians,
the
original
crimes
of
this
case
is
the
altercation
of
the
ball
park,
are
clearly
under
state
jurisdiction
without
regard
to
public
law
280,
but
if
they
are
under
state
jurisdiction
then
they
are
under
federal
jurisdiction.
mr.
slade
gorton
absent
public
law
280
--
mr.
slade
gorton
no,
you
do
not.
mr.
slade
gorton
the
congress
at
least
has
to
try
before
they
can
validly
assert
it.
whether
congress
can
constitutionally
give
the
indians
this
jurisdiction
is
another
point
which
was
at
least
(voice
overlap)
mr.
slade
gorton
i
do
not
concede
that.
in
our
view
whether
by
statute
or
by
constitution,
tribal
self
government
ends
where
the
common
self
government
of
all
citizens
begins.
may
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
argument.
mr.
slade
gorton
it
would
have
a
very
substantial
impact
on
that
situation.
i
cannot
tell
you
that
it
would
govern
in
because
there
are
at
least
two
differences
between
this
and
that
situation
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
the
first
is
that
the
individual
whom
you
posited
is
not
a
resident
and
therefore
it
does
not
have
any
right
to
self
government
and
secondly
the
navajo
treaties
may
be
different
from
the
treaties
with
which
we
are
dealing
here,
that
jurisdiction
may
have
been
given
to
the
navajos
by
their
treaties.
i
just
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
slade
gorton
i
cannot
use
that.
mr.
slade
gorton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
trust
that
you
have
noted
how
extraordinary
that
presentation
of
the
united
states
is,
but
until
1968,
this
indian
tribe
could
have
hung
a
non-indian
for
burglary
without
offering
him
any
constitutional
rights
whatsoever.
i
think
i
do
want
to
speak
very
briefly
on
the
technically
not
quite
relevant
to
facts
--
mr.
slade
gorton
before
1868
sir,
that
may
be
correct.
there
was
at
least
a
constitution
on
under
those
circumstances
for
the
state
and
during
these
years
pre-1868
this
tribe
had
no
constitution
either.
there
were
not
even
indian
constitution
rights,
but
they
are
claiming,
the
united
states
submission
is
that
indian
jurisdiction
or
rather
at
least
that
the
indian
tribal
jurisdiction
on
this
reservation
over
non-indians
except
under
the
mcbratney
exception
was
plenary
and
was
not
derived
from
the
constitution
and
was
not
subject
to
constitutional
guarantees.
here,
the
respondents
have
constantly
made
the
point
of
what
a
terrible
situation
will
exist
as
far
as
the
enforcement
of
the
law
on
this
reservation
is
concerned
unless
they
are
allowed
to
try
these
cases.
they
failed
to
tell
you
that
they
have
objected
vociferously
and
consistently
to
any
exercise
of
state
jurisdiction
under
public
law
280.
at
this
point,
unless
you
hear
an
appeal
on
it,
they
have
successfully
objected
to
that
jurisdiction.
so
on
the
one
hand,
they
are
saying
the
state
will
not
come
and
enforce
its
laws
on
the
reservation
and
on
the
other
when
we
try
to
do
so
they
are
saying
that
you
cannot
come
and
enforce
your
law
on
the
reservation.
the
cure
to
that
situation
is
extraordinary
simple.
even
if
they
are
correct
in
their
position
on
public
law
280,
the
indians
civil
rights
act
gives
them
the
power
to
ask
the
state
to
take
jurisdiction,
total
or
limited
on
that
reservation.
our
state
has
already
deputized
other
tribal
police
officers
on
the
reservation
such
as
the
yakama
who
have
the
authority
to
make
arrest
for
the
violation
of
the
state
laws.
therefore,
they
do
not
need
a
genealogical
chart
in
order
to
--
mr.
slade
gorton
no,
the
question
relates
primarily
to
jurisdiction
over
indians.
mr.
slade
gorton
i
do
not.
mr.
slade
gorton
i
am
sorry?
mr.
slade
gorton
whether
the
state
power
has
concurrent
power
to
try
indians
depends
on
the
validity
of
public
law
280
and
that
is
a
separate
case
which
we
have--
mr.
slade
gorton
we
do
not.
mr.
slade
gorton
that
is
quite
correct.
finally,
to
state
the
proposition
that
the
state
and
local
authorities
have
no
interest
in
providing
law
enforcement
authority
for
3,000
of
their
own
voting
citizens
on
this
reservation
or
perhaps,
for
25,000
potential
voting
citizens
on
a
reservation
some
place
in
montana,
is
something
nonsense.
of
course,
the
county
has
exactly
the
same
interest
in
the
enforcement
of
the
law
in
this
area
as
it
does
not
any
other
area
in
that
county.
mr.
justice
stevens
asked
the
question
of
counsel
as
to
the
situation
of
the
indians
got
in
1850,
after
the
oregon
territory
act,
but
before
any
indian
treaties
were
signed.
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
believe
could
have
asked
a
much
broader
question
and
received
the
same
answer.
under
the
submission
of
the
tribes,
the
indians
would
have
had
the
right
to
seek
out
that
scout
at
any
place
in
the
oregon
territory
and
try
him
for
any
asserted
violation
of
its
code
whatsoever
because
of
these
doctrine
of
retained
sovereignty.
we
say
there
are
at
least
two
grounds
under
which
the
answer
is
no
to
that
question.
the
indians
simply
did
not
retain
that
sovereignty
under
the
way
in
which
sovereignty
is
considered
by
the
united
states.
as
of
1846,
by
the
time
of
the
completion
of
the
treaty
with
great
britain,
the
sovereignty
of
the
united
states
over
that
territory,
of
the
united
states
was
total.
when
the
united
states
in
the
oregon
treaty
statute
sought
to
preserve
rights
of
indians,
it
did
not
talk
about
some
kind
of
retained
sovereignty.
it
said
that
we
will
not
take
away
their
rights
to
persons,
their
personal
or
property
rights,
except
by
treaty.
again,
i
say
it
is
absurd
to
think
that
the
united
states
blively
(ph)
left
all
of
the
settlers
who
were
moving
into
that
territory
to
the
plenary
jurisdiction
of
the
indians.
under
those
circumstances
until
they
could
reduce
them,
reduce
them
geographically
only
to
a
set
of
reservations.
that
is
simply
is
not
consistent
with
the
history
of
the
united
states.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
slade
gorton
the
answer
to
that
question
is
clearly
no
because
the
suquamish
tribe
did
not
exist
until
governor
stevens
came
out
there
and
organized
it
as
a
political
unit
in
order
to
sign
a
treaty
with
it.
mr.
slade
gorton
arbitrarily
selected
by
the
governor
stevens.
mr.
slade
gorton
well,
there
was
no
tribe
before
stevens
created
it
in
order
to
sign
this
treaty.
some
of
the
particular
indians
who
were
later
(inaudible)
suquamish
may
very
well
have
lived
in
this
area.
mr.
slade
gorton
they
may
have.
it
is
very
difficult
to
tell
at
this
point.
