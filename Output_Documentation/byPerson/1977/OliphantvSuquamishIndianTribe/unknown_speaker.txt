mr.
malone,
what
is
the
size
and
composition
of
the
total
judicial
grants
of
the
tribe.
i
understood
you
to
say
only
53
members
reside
within
the
reservation.
how
many
of
the
members
of
the
judicial
branch
and
what
are
their
positions.
how
many
judges
for
example?
unknown
speaker
how
many
police
officers?
unknown
speaker
do
they
have
a
courthouse
and
a
clerk
and
what
establishment?
unknown
speaker
and
they
have
a
jail?
unknown
speaker
where
do
they
incarcerate?
unknown
speaker
who
pays
for
all
of
this?
unknown
speaker
and
how
are
the
judges
chosen,
are
they
elected
or
--?
unknown
speaker
that
police
car
was
again
owned
by
the
tribe
i
take
it?
unknown
speaker
and
that
prompts
me
to
ask
mr.
malone,
whether
whatever
principles
are
forthcoming
in
this
case
that
you
feel
should
apply
to
all
indian
reservations?
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
not
the
case
later
in
the
week
involving
another
host,
are
you
familiar
with
that
case?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
some
of
the
facts
are
not
particularly
important
though?
unknown
speaker
mr.
ernstoff,
before
you
sit
down,
am
i
correct,
did
your
firm
in
addition
to
the
respondentâ€™s
brief
also
filed
a
brief
amicus?
unknown
speaker
so
you
got
a
one,
two
punch?
unknown
speaker
do
you
often
file
amicus
briefs
in
cases
in
which
you
are
a
counsel
for
one
of
the
primary
parties?
unknown
speaker
and
we
should
just
assume
to
recognize
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
a
territorial
sovereignty
itself?
unknown
speaker
mr.
farr,
you
said
that
they
did
not
have
a
sophisticated
concept
of
land
ownership,
did
the
united
states
recognize
any
land
ownership
rights
in
the
indians
other
than
those
granted
by
treaty?
unknown
speaker
and
how
did
they
lose
that
right?
unknown
speaker
was
it
not
simply
by
virtue
of
the
united
states
exercising
total
jurisdiction
over
the
territory
that
there
would
ordinarily
be
a
sovereign
right,
simply
was
assumed
not
to
exist?
unknown
speaker
and
why
does
not
the
same
argument
apply
to
the
criminal
jurisdiction
over
non-indians?
unknown
speaker
mr.
farr,
can
i
ask
you?
why
does
not
the
indian
sovereignty,
the
tribal
sovereignty
extend
to
the
prosecution
of
felonies?
unknown
speaker
so
you
are
saying
because
it
is
a
federal
statute
which
cuts
back
to
sovereignty?
unknown
speaker
without
a
federal
statute
that
leads
on
prosecutions
for
felony
or
the
limits
of
a
punishment,
the
tribe
would
have
the
--?
