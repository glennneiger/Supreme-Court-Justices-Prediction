justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
basic
theory
about
where
the
jurisdiction
all
comes
from?
supposing
we
had
the
case
arising
in
1850
after
the
treaty
with
great
britain
and
before
the
treaty
of
point
elliott,
would
you
say
that
at
that
time
if
an
american
scout
wandered
on
to
the
tribal
lands,
that
the
tribe
would
have
jurisdiction
in
the
sense
we
are
talking
about
it
to
try
that
person
and
the
american
courts
would
recognize
that
jurisdiction,
at
that
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
critical
to
your
cases,
is
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
in
the
killing
of
a
non-indian,
what
the
tribal
sovereignty
that
existed
has
been
taken
away?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
farr,
if
i
may
ask
just
one
other
question,
putting
to
one
side
all
the
statutes
for
a
moment,
going
back
to
what
the
tribes
retained
as
its
original
concept
to
sovereignty,
if
i
understand
your
position
correctly,
you
do
not
contend
that
they
originally
retain
the
power
to
try
for
major
crimes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
did
they
lose
the
power
to
try
non-indians
from
major
crimes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
until
1968,
they
possessed
that
power?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
never
exercised
it
though?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
280
question
--
that
question
relate
to
non-indians
and
indians.
i
take
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
i
take
it
you
do
not
object,
you
do
not
say
now
that
the
indian
tribe
does
not
have
power
to
try
indians?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
say
the
state
does?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
say
the
state
has
concurrent
power
to
try
indians?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
ask
you
mr.
attorney
general
is
the
suquamish
reservation
part
of
the
historic
area
in
which
the
tribe
lived
or
is
it
different?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
the
reservation
area
is
one
is
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
is
not
one
as
to
which
the
tribe
had
any
indian
title
originally?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
what
i
want
to
know.
did
they
live
in
this
area?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thanks.
