justice
potter
stewart
mr.
malone,
you
have
submitted
to
us
here
constitutional
plan.
we
do
not
reach
those
however
at
all,
do
we,
unless
we
resolve
the
statutory
issues
against
you
and
actually
we
do
not
first
proceed
to
canvas
these
statutory
issues
and
determine
whether
not
statutory
issues
towards
the
briefs
are
largely
addressed
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
law
provides
that
non-indian
shall
be
prosecutable
on
this
reservation
by
the
tribe
and
other
indian
law?
justice
potter
stewart
here
we
got,
in
other
words,
a
cart
before
the
horse
a
little
bit.
i
assume
your
colleague
here
is
going
to
talk
about
the
statutory
issues.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
attorney
general.
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
the
--
most
of
your
argument
as
i
have
understood
it
would
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
the
government
does
have
jurisdiction
over
these
people.
it
is
not
your
state,
the
state
of
washington,
but
rather
the
united
states
of
america
under
18
u.s.c.
1151
and
the
rest
of
your
argument.
i
suppose
the
issue
here
is
whether
or
not
the
indian
tribe
has
jurisdiction
and
we
do
not
necessarily
need
to
decide
if
it
does
not,
who
does?
justice
potter
stewart
the
amicus
brief
as
you
know,
suggests
that
we
even
defer
argument
in
this
case
until
we
decide
whether
or
not
we
are
going
to
take
the
yakama
case?
justice
potter
stewart
then
your
submission
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
we
do
not
need
to
decide
in
order
to
decide
in
your
favor
who
does
have
jurisdiction?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
before
we
move
on,
this
is
not
just
a
matter
of
legislative
solution,
if
there
is
anything
in
the
constitutional
claims
made
by
your
opponent
because
even
though
your
position
were
clear
as
a
matter
of
legislation
or
treaty,
we
still
then
would
have
the
constitutional
claims
to
deal
with
would
we
not?
justice
potter
stewart
with
fifth
amendment
claims
and
for
example
a
jury
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
and
for
these
offenses?
justice
potter
stewart
and
how
many
eligible
jurors
are
there?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
not
even
all
members
of
the
tribe.
i
assume
some
of
them
are
children,
are
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
so
how
many,
a
couple
of
dozen
eligible
jurors?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
in
which
sense
would
you
answer
the
question?
justice
potter
stewart
you
would
have
about
the
same
jury
in
every
case,
would
you
not?
justice
potter
stewart
would
you
answer
my
question?
justice
potter
stewart
and
none
of
the
jurors
would
be
of
the
same
ethnic
background
as
any
of
this
defense?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
those
are
statutory
rights,
but
american
citizens
have
constitutional
rights,
do
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
exactly,
and
therefore,
these
defendants
are
deprived
of
their
constitutional
rights
that
are
accorded
to
most
american
citizens,
if
not
all
others?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
that
somewhere
in
the
federal
law
system
you
will
find
some
authority
for
the
indian
tribe
to
exercise
the
jurisdiction
that
you
claim
they
have?
justice
potter
stewart
and
where
do
you
find
it?
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
it,
is
it
just
sort
of
federal
common
law?
if
this
court
holds
that
a
tribe
has
some
residual
sovereignty,
what
authority
we
got
to
say
that?
is
it
a
sort
of
federal
common
law?
justice
potter
stewart
not
based
on
the
constitution
or
a
statute
or
--?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
do
you
think
that
the
indian
tribes
in
exercising
this
power
are
exercising
part
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
united
states
as
well
as
that
of
the
indian
tribe?
justice
potter
stewart
well
what
we
have
here
is
not
the
1834
act,
but
the
amendment
of
1854
which
pre-dated
the
conclusion
of
this
treaty?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
1854
statute
said
that
the
united
states
should
have
federal
criminal
jurisdiction
within
any
indian
reservation
with
three
exceptions
and
the
third
exception
which
is
the
only
one
applicable
here
is
any
case
where
by
treaty
stipulations
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
such
offenses
is
or
may
be
secured
by
the
indian
tribes
respectively?
justice
potter
stewart
and
certainly,
the
negotiators
for
the
united
states
of
america
knew
of
the
enactment
of
that
statute
in
1854
when
they
concluded
this
treaty
in
1855
and
they
realized
that
in
the
absence
of
stipulations
to
the
contrary,
the
tribe
under
the
1854
act
simply
would
not
have
criminal
jurisdiction
over
non-indians.
is
that
not
the
reason
that
that
original
provision
was
deleted
because
it
was
necessary
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
united
states?
justice
potter
stewart
there
had
to
be
treaty
stipulation
to
the
contrary,
otherwise
the
statute
took
it
away?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
the
state?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
what
do
you
mean
with
the
members
of
the
reservation?
are
they
the
members
of
the
tribe
or
they
are
residents
on
the
reservation?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
where
does
that
money
go?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
are
the
programs?
justice
potter
stewart
by
the
tribe?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they
get
money
based
upon
the
number
of
people
on
the
reservation?
justice
potter
stewart
the
money
goes
to
the
tribe
for
the
tribal
users
and
that
is
just
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
be
more
difficult
for
a
place
to
live
for
a
non-indian,
if
you
are
right?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
even
if
we
buy
that
position
100%,
the
question
would
still
remain
whether
or
not
that
historic
sovereignty
included
the
power
to
try
and
convict
non-tribal
members
of
criminal
offenses
and
violation
of
tribal
law,
that
is
certainly
historically
before
the
white
man
got
here,
it
did
not?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
leaves
it
open,
does
it
not?
i
mean,
you
concede
that
it
is
not
a
full
sovereignty
as
indeed
you
must?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
question
is
then
does
it
include
as
i
say
the
power
to
try
and
convict
and
punish
either
non-members
of
the
tribe
or
non-indians?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
begin
by
conceding
it
is
not
full,
so
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
and
also
it
did
not
begin
as
full
sovereignty,
did
it?
justice
potter
stewart
not
a
territorial
sovereignty,
did
it?
justice
potter
stewart
was
that
not
a
concept
wholly
alien
to
indian
tribes,
the
concept
of
territorial
sovereignty
they
were
by
--
even
those
that
were
not
nomadic
it
did
not
stay
right
within
the
meets
and
bounds
of
what
is
now
a
reservation
because
there
were
no
such
things.
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
a
tribal
self-government,
but
it
was
not
territorial
sovereignty,
was
it
ever?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
when
you
say
there
is
no
intension
to
cut
it
off,
you
have
to
first
of
all,
have
convinced
your
self
and
us
that
it
is
existed?
justice
potter
stewart
and
nothing
you
have
said
so
far
has
indicated
that
to
me?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
there
was
limited
sovereignty,
but
there
is
no
case
in
this
court
where
that
sovereignty
included
the
power
to
try
and
punish
for
criminal
offense
of
a
non-indian?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
is
tribal,
it
is
tribal?
justice
potter
stewart
like
mcbratney?
justice
potter
stewart
or
kill
a
non-indian
on
the
reservation?
justice
potter
stewart
under
mcbratney?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
is
in
the
yakama
case?
as
of
now,
in
the
ninth
circuit
position.
justice
potter
stewart
you
do
not?
