mr.
chestnut
h.
bartow
farr
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
because
the
issues
in
this
case
are
numerous
and
difficult
and
because
of
the
extensive
briefing
on
all
sides,
i
would
like
at
the
outset
to
make
clear
what
the
position
of
the
united
states
is
and
is
not.
first,
at
the
heart
of
our
submission
and
directly
opposed
to
the
position
taken
by
a
petitioners
in
the
state
of
washington
is
the
principle
that
the
indian
tribes
do
not
depend
upon
the
united
states
for
the
creation
of
their
powers
of
government.
these
powers
instead
are
derived
from
an
inherent
sovereignty
that
antedates
the
european
settlement
of
the
united
states
and
indeed
the
formation
of
the
united
states
itself.
now,
in
the
questioning
earlier
in
this
case,
it
has
been
asked
whether,
in
fact,
we
depend
on
particular
federal
statutes
or
treaties
to
establish
that
or
the
power
or
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
itself.
we
do
not
depend
on
those.
we
believe
that
the
sovereignty
antedates
all
of
that
and
in
fact
the
reason
that
congress
did
not
pass
statutes
for
example,
creating
inherent
sovereignty
of
the
tribe
--
mr.
chestnut
h.
bartow
farr
iii
i
believe
that
the
court
has
recognized
it
before
and
should
again.
mr.
chestnut
h.
bartow
farr
iii
before
the
indians
had
had
to
cover
on
the
indians
itself.
however,
we
believe
that
even
when
the
white
settlers
did
get
here
that
the
sovereignty
of
the
indian
tribes
who
at
the
time
of
course
were
dealing
by
treaty
with
the
settlement
nations,
were
occasionally
at
war
with
them,
did
extend
far
enough
at
least
to
protect
themselves
against
intrusions
by
whites,
crimes
against
the
tribe
itself
or
against
its
members
and
that
that
sovereignty
continues
now.
mr.
chestnut
h.
bartow
farr
iii
no,
i
do
not.
mr.
chestnut
h.
bartow
farr
iii
i
think
in
terms
of
sure
sovereignty
which
is
the
point
i
am
going
to
discuss
in
just
a
moment
that
this
court
has
recognized
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
recognizes
that
there
are
principally
the
federal
government
and
the
states.
there
are
two
sovereignties.
however,
the
fact
that
the
sovereignty
of
the
indians
is
not
a
full
sovereignty
to
the
extent
that
the
federal
government
possess
a
sovereignty
or
the
states
possess
sovereignty,
does
not
seem
to
me
to
settle
the
question
of
whether
the
sovereignty
that
they
have
is
so
thin
that
it
does
not
cover
this
one.
mr.
chestnut
h.
bartow
farr
iii
we
do
concede
it
is
not
a
full
sovereignty.
mr.
chestnut
h.
bartow
farr
iii
that
is
right
and
i
think
that
that
is
the
question
which
the
court
has
to
decide
in
this
case
at
outset
--
mr.
chestnut
h.
bartow
farr
iii
we
concede
that
it
is
not
full.
we
recognize
as
chief
justice
marshall
said
way
back
in
worcester
v.
georgia
that
the
indian
tribes
are
to
the
extent
that
their
sovereignties,
dependent
sovereignties
and
that
they
are
dependent
upon
the
federal
government
at
least
if
not
to
create
their
powers
not
to
take
them
away.
history
in
nearly
two
centuries
of
legal
authority
demonstrate
that
the
tribe
sovereignty
is
subject
to
the
greater
sovereignty
of
the
united
states
and
in
the
exercise
of
its
own
sovereignty,
the
united
states
has
established
a
special
relationship
towards
a
unique
responsibility
for
the
indians
in
the
united
states.
thus
we
do
agree
with
petitioners
mr.
justice
stewart
that
the
tribal
sovereignty
can
be
in
and
in
many
respects
has
been
circumscribed
by
the
united
states,
so
to
that
extent
that
it
is
not
a
full
sovereignty.
mr.
chestnut
h.
bartow
farr
iii
well,
i
think
it
did.
mr.
chestnut
h.
bartow
farr
iii
well,
it
did
not
begin
--
mr.
chestnut
h.
bartow
farr
iii
that
is
right
mr.
justice
stewart.
at
the
time
before
there
was
an
indian
settlement
--
mr.
chestnut
h.
bartow
farr
iii
well,
in
the
beginning
it
was
certainly
tribal
self-government
because
as
you
posit
they
did
not
have
a
sophisticated
concept
of
land
ownership
and
there
was
not
anybody
else
to
govern
that,
it
is
just
now.
mr.
chestnut
h.
bartow
farr
iii
that
is
because
they
did
not
view
territory
as
belonging
to
particular
individual
tribes.
that
is
a
concept
to
which
the
european
settlers
quickly
educated
and
it
is
not
clear
to
me
that
that
means
that
once
they
developed
that
understanding
that
their
sovereignty
because
it
did
not
depend
on
it
at
the
outset
was
not
sufficient
to
cover
it
when
it
was
developed.
mr.
chestnut
h.
bartow
farr
iii
well,
no
they
did
not.
i
think
one
of
the
first
sovereign
rights
that
they
lost
to
the
extent
that
they
would
have
inclined
to
assert
it
at
all
was
the
right
to
own
land
as
against
sovereignty
of
the
united
states
--
mr.
chestnut
h.
bartow
farr
iii
i
think
that
that
is
an
in
a
central
part
of
living
within
the
jurisdiction
of
a
sovereign
in
which
you
are
dependent.
[voice
overlap]
mr.
chestnut
h.
bartow
farr
iii
i
think
necessarily
it
must.
i
mean
clearly
it
did.
mr.
chestnut
h.
bartow
farr
iii
because
i
do
not
think,
by
necessary
implication
that
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
right
of
the
united
states
to
assert
their
own
criminal
jurisdiction
to
assert
that
the
tribes
can
also
have
criminal
jurisdiction
whereas
i
do
think
it
is
inconsistent
necessarily
with
the
position
of
the
united
states
as
sovereign
over
its
land
to
say
that
the
indians
could
contract
and
make
treaties
with
foreign
countries,
could
lease
out
their
lands
for
a
naval
base
for
a
foreign
country.
so
i
do
not
think
that
is
necessary
inconsistency
in
this
case.
as
a
result
of
these
positions,
we
do
believe
it
is
necessary
in
order
to
resolve
these
cases
to
examine
as
the
court
usually
has
to
do
in
indian
cases,
the
relevant
statutes
and
treaties
in
accordance
with
the
principles
of
sovereignties
just
discussed.
at
the
same
time
we
ask
that
the
court
keep
in
mind
establish
rules
of
statutory
construction
that
again
are
repeated
in
all
indian
cases
that
were
the
statutes
and
treaties
are
ambiguous,
that
they
should
not
be
construed
to
the
indiansâ€™
detriment.
now,
with
regard
to
the
present
cases,
the
particular
treaty
provision
at
issue
is
the
treaty
of
point
elliott
and
the
particular
statutes
in
our
opinion
as
18
u.s.c.
1152
which
comes
at
the
end
of
a
long
line
of
similar
statutes.
now,
we
find
in
that
treaty,
in
that
statute,
no
clear
expression
of
congressional
intent
to
cut
off
tribal
jurisdiction
entirely
in
every
instance
where
non-indians
have
committed
a
crime.
at
best
we
can
find
some
provisions
that
seem
ambiguous,
that
are
suspect
and
can
be
interpreted
as
petitioners
in
the
state
of
washington
have
done
to
support
one
conclusion
or
the
other,
but
we
find
no
clear
statement
such
as
we
think
is
required
by
the
principles
of
statutory
construction
that
this
court
has
laid
down.
mr.
chestnut
h.
bartow
farr
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
chestnut
h.
bartow
farr
iii
i
have
as
i
suppose
given
my
best
shot.
i
mean,
i
think
that
the
cases
[laughter],
the
authorities
we
cited
in
our
brief
and
the
position
we
take
is
apparent
there
and
i
believe
that
that
sovereignty
exists
and
it
does
cover
it.
mr.
chestnut
h.
bartow
farr
iii
the
court
has
not
said
that.
that
is
true,
but
if
that
sovereignty
does
not
exist
to
some
extent,
it
is
difficult
to
explain,
to
begin
with
where
the
indians
get
the
sovereignty
over
their
own
members,
that
has
been
conferred
by
anything
in
particular.
mr.
chestnut
h.
bartow
farr
iii
well,
they
have
in
fact
done
that
in
many
cases.
mr.
chestnut
h.
bartow
farr
iii
but
the
court
had
said
that
they
are
not
in
the
situation
of
a
private
club.
the
opinion
for
the
court
in
mazurie
said
that,
that
they
are
something
far
more
than
that
and
that
they
have
a
unique
position
which
is
not
that
a
group
of
people
who
(voice
overlap)
mr.
chestnut
h.
bartow
farr
iii
i
assume
that
they
could
form
a
voluntary
association
(voice
overlap)
mr.
chestnut
h.
bartow
farr
iii
they
do
now
and
i
believe
they
do
so
in
the
exercise
of
their
sovereignty.
i
believe
they
probably
could
do
so,
at
least
to
govern
themselves
by
voluntary
organization.
fourth
in
just
completing
our
submission
on
this
general
point,
we
do
not
believe
that
public
law
280
constitutes
a
bar
to
assertion
of
tribal
jurisdiction
in
this
case
and
we
have
discussed
this
briefly
in
our
brief
here
and
we
have
also
alluded
to
it
in
our
amicus
memorandum
in
the
yakama
nation
case
which
we
filed
late
last
week.
although,
we
recognize
that
congress
in
public
law
280
has
extended
the
rights,
the
opportunity
to
assert
jurisdiction
over
the
indian
tribes,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
assertion
by
the
state
of
washington
is
valid,
and
therefore,
it
would
not
reach
to
this
case.
now,
in
the
few
moments
remaining,
i
just
like
to
say
brief
words
about
the
practical
effects
of
indian
jurisdiction.
although,
we
do
not
underestimate
the
possible
difficulties,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
result
will
be
catastrophe
that
the
petitioners
in
the
state
of
washington
seem
to
predict.
we
do
not
believe
it
is
an
extraordinary
notion
that
indians
would
have
a
right
to
protect
themselves
against
crimes
committed
by
other
person.
mr.
chestnut
h.
bartow
farr
iii
it
does
not
extend
to
the
prosecution
of
felonies
at
this
time
because
the
indian
civil
rights
act
has
limited
the
punishment
which
the
indian
tribes
can
meet
out.
mr.
chestnut
h.
bartow
farr
iii
there
is
a
federal
statute
that
cuts
back.
mr.
chestnut
h.
bartow
farr
iii
i
think
encompass
within
the
notion
of
tribal
sovereignty
is
the
fact
that
if
a
non-indian
came
on
the
reservation
and
killed
an
indian
that
they
could
have
tried
him
if
the
federal
government
has
not
taken
that
away?
mr.
chestnut
h.
bartow
farr
iii
to
could
kill
a
non-indian,
then
mcbratney
and
those
cases
put
exclusive
jurisdiction
on
the
state
under
terms
of
enabling
act
and
that
doctrine.
so
it
would
be
necessarily
their
interest
would
be
implicated
by
the
killing
of
an
indian.
mr.
chestnut
h.
bartow
farr
iii
in
the
killing
of
a
non-indian,
the
tribal
sovereignty
to
the
extent
that
it
is
existed,
there
is
an
open
question
in
that
is
to
whether
an
indian
interest
is
sufficiently
connected
to
that.
mr.
chestnut
h.
bartow
farr
iii
right,
to
justify
and
assert
sovereignty
and
to
the
extent
that
there
was
any
sovereignty
it
has
been
taken
away,
that
is
correct.
mr.
chestnut
h.
bartow
farr
iii
right,
we
do
believe
that
there
is
must
be
a
tribal
interest.
mr.
chestnut
h.
bartow
farr
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
chestnut
h.
bartow
farr
iii
i
believe
as
i
read
facts
in
this
case,
they
would
have,
speeding
through
an
indian
reservation.
mr.
chestnut
h.
bartow
farr
iii
i
believe
that
would
be
covered
by
mcbratney
mr.
justices
powell
and
the
state
would
have
jurisdiction
of
that
crime.
mr.
chestnut
h.
bartow
farr
iii
it
is
possible.
this
is
questionable
ground
that
i
am
getting
into,
but
it
is
possible
that
if
a
crime
by
a
non-indian
against
a
non-indian
sufficiently
endangered
tribal
interest
that
there
might
be
some
way
for
a
tribe
to
assert
jurisdiction,
but
i
think
in
the
normal
case
mcbratney
leaves
that
to
the
states.
mr.
chestnut
h.
bartow
farr
iii
no,
i
believe
that
our
submission
is
not
that.
i
believe
originally
that
they
did
have
the
power
to
try
for
major
crimes.
if
they
had
the
sovereign
power
to
protect
themselves
and
their
members
(voice
overlap).
mr.
chestnut
h.
bartow
farr
iii
they
have
lost
that
in
indian
civil
rights
act.
mr.
chestnut
h.
bartow
farr
iii
that
is
right.
now,
there
is
no
question
that
that
power
(voice
overlap).
mr.
chestnut
h.
bartow
farr
iii
that
is
right.
mr.
chestnut
h.
bartow
farr
iii
the
major
crimes
act
covering
indians.
mr.
chestnut
h.
bartow
farr
iii
that
is
correct.
it
defines
in
terms
of
punishment
and
not
the
actual
crime,
but
i
think
both
as
a
practical
matter
that
that
was
more
or
less
disabled.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
