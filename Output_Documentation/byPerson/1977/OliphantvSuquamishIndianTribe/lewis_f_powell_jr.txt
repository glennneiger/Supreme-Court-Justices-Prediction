justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
do
we,
mr.
attorney
general,
i
suppose
you
are
going
to
tell
us,
but
where
do
we
turn
to
answer
that
question?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
it
some
statute
or
just
some
case
law?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
your
position
is
confined
to
situation
where
there
is
a
tribal
interest?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
there
were
two
charges
against
belgarde
as
i
recall,
one
was
called
for
speeding
or
reckless
drive
and
then
the
other
was
called
damaging
indian
property?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
it
only
has
been
the
first
charge,
would
the
indian
courts
have
had
jurisdiction?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
suppose
belgarde,
instead
of
being
driving
had
just
mugged
another
non-indian
back
on
the
reservation?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
unless
he
was
about
to
precipitate
a
riot?
