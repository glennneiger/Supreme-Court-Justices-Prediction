mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
it
please
the
court.
the
case
before
you
i
consider
to
be
basically
a
fairly
routine
except
of
course
for
the
novel
legal
questions
behind
that
law
and
order
case.
the
only
question
really
is
and
i
think
the
last
series
of
questions
pointed
this
out
who
is
going
to
have
what
we
call
misdemeanor
jurisdiction
over
all
persons
of
an
indian
reservation.
the
alternatives
at
this
point
as
far
as
the
law
stated
is
the
tribe
or
the
federal
government
and
i
would
pose
that
any
federal
judge
sitting
in
any
of
the
federal
courts
around
this
country
who
was
told
that
he
was
going
to
have
to
have
in
his
courtroom
all
the
belittling
offenses,
failure
to
stop
for
a
stop
sign,
failure
to
signal
for
turn
that
he
would
have
to
be
prosecuting
those
on
the
(inaudible)
crimes
act
which
is
what
the
us
attorney
would
have
to
do
would
tend
to
agree
with
the
position.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
i
would
presume
so
your
honor,
but
the
question,
i
think
is
a
serious
question
in
the
matter
of
federal
judicial
policy
aside
from
the
legal
issues
that
are
involved.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
with
the
army
camps
sir,
my
understanding
is
there
is
a
system
of
military
justice
as
well
as
the
federal
courts.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
a
federal
magistrates
is
used.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
well,
perhaps
but
thus
far
i
can
tell
you
at
least
in
seattle.
i
am
sure
that
the
chief
justice
has
heard
everyone
complaining
about
not
enough
federal
judges
and
federal
magistrates
that
does
not
seem
to
be
a
great
deal
of
con
available.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
that
is
correct
your
honor.
i
think
the
more
important
is
to
understand
really
what
the
case
is
about
in
terms
of
the
treaties
and
the
agreements
between
indian
tribes
and
united
states.
and
perhaps
i
am
trying
to
attempt
to
make
this
too
larger
case
for
what
seems
to
be
a
relatively
minor
issue
in
terms
of
the
offense.
but
that
is
one
of
the
treaties
do
and
i
think
it
is
important
for
the
court
to
understand
this.
the
treaties
established
what
ought
to
be
the
final
homeland
for
indians
in
this
country.
anyone
who
is
knowledgeable
about
western
history,
certainly
in
our
state
knows,
that
indians
basically
roam
throughout
the
state
and
agreed
there
were
no
wars
in
the
state
of
washington.
they
agreed
basically
to
cede
land
to
the
united
states
government
in
exchange
for
being
given
their
reservations
as
a
homeland.
now,
i
acknowledge
that
because
of
the
united
states
government,
the
federal
government,
there
is
an
anomaly
today
and
that
is
that
these
reservations,
non-indians
were
allowed
to
settle
on
whether
to
the
general
allotment
act
or
through
treaty
provisions
which
in
this
case
is
what
prevails.
the
allotments,
the
assignments
of
land
were
made
to
the
treaty,
not
the
general
allotment
act
or
whether
through
the
opening
up
a
reservation
to
settlement.
the
question
remains
now
is
how
is
this
anomaly
going
to
be
dealt
with.
i
am
the
first
to
acknowledge
that
i
think
an
important
question
the
fact
that
people
living
within
the
reservation
cannot
participate
in
tribal
government,
but
the
question
remains
then
which
way
does
one
go?
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
danger
to
american
indian
policy
and
to
the
promises
of
this
government
in
telling
indian
tribes
that
in
choosing
between
these,
because
of
this
anomaly,
these
two
alternatives
that
we
have
chosen
basically
to
eliminate
any
control
you
might
have
on
your
reservation
over
non-indian
trespassers
or
other
committers
of
minor
offenses
is
the
wrong
way
to
go
and
is
really
going
to
harm.
indian
interest
and
the
interest
of
this
court
has
upheld
in
previous
cases,
in
recent
cases
much
more
than
the
harm
that
might
be
done
to
the
non-indian
who
i
admit
is
in
an
unfortunate
situation.
i
think
that
the
question
that
was
asker
earlier
by
the
court
about
should
you
not
be
arguing
to
congress
about
this
is
the
proper
question.
this
court
has
always
held
that
congress
is
the
place
to
determine
how
jurisdiction
should
be
allocated
among
states,
federal
government
and
in
indian
tribes
and
in
fact
congress
has
taken
this
challenge
since
this
case
began
in
the
district
court.
congress
established
an
11-man
commission,
the
american-indian
policy
review
commission
to
investigate
over
a
period
of
two
years
over
extensive
congressional
commission
investigation,
matters
of
jurisdiction
on
indian
reservations
and
to
come
up
with
legislative
solutions
and
that
report
was
issued,
this
is
in
the
brief
was
issued
in
may
of
1977.
there
were
six
members
of
congress
on
the
commission
and
five
indians
on
the
commission,
indian
leaders
and
that
commission
said
that
they
find
that
not
only
as
a
matter
of
law
do
they
consider
that
indian
tribes
have
jurisdiction
over
non-indians,
but
because
of
the
heinous
situation
in
most
western
states
about
local
law
enforcement
from
counties
and
states
that
it
is
necessary
and
is
a
cataloging
of
all
the
problems.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
no.
what
i
am
suggesting
though
is
that
the
answer
to
the
question
should
not
congress
be
dealing
with
this
is
correct.
that
is
where
this
ought
to
be
happening
not
in
this
court.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
it
does
not.
one
hopes
that
legislation
will
come
to
this
and
it
was
just
my
position
that
a
legislative
framework,
a
legislative
solution
which
takes
great
deal
time,
a
lot
of
discussion
and
much
testimony
to
decide
how
to
deal
with
these
problems
as
a
much
better
solution
than
this
court
having
to
deal
with
the
problem
in
terms
of
exacting
definitions.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
that
brings
up
the
problem
of
the
facts
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
that
is
correct.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
there
is
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
under
the
indian
civil
rights
act.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
for
these
offenses.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
at
this
point,
the
numbers
of
eligible
jurors
are
the
members
of
the
tribe.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
that
is
correct.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
i
think
your
honor
these
points
out
a
very
important
point
and
that
is
--
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
when
these
problems
come
up,
the
answer
to
the
question
is
it
is
very
possible
for
instance
that
the
lack
of
non-indians
under
the
near
to
be
selected
for
the
jury
is
in
fact
impermissible
under
the
indian
civil
rights
act.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
the
point
i
am
making
is
that
that
is
exactly
(voice
overlap).
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
the
answer
is
yes.
at
this
point,
the
near
is
very
small.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
that
is
correct
and
it
may
be
impermissible
under
the
indian
civil
rights
act.
it
is
up
to
the
federal
court
to
determine
that
and
has
not
yet
been
determined.
what
i
am
saying
and
this
is
what
court
said,
in
the
united
states
v.
mazurie.
there
is
a
protection
for
non-indian
residents
of
indian
reservations.
since
1968,
there
has
been
the
indian
civil
rights
act
and
these
petitioners
had
no
problem
invoking
that
act
in
attempting
to
get
review
on
what
they
consider
to
be
the
violation
of
their
statutory
right.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
american
citizens
have
constitutional
rights,
but
most
constitutional
rights
of
the
first
10
amendments
are
rights
against
the
state
government
and
against
the
federal
government.
this
court
in
1897
of
talton
v.
mayes
held
that
those
constitutional
rights,
the
bill
of
rights
does
not
apply
to
the
actions
of
indian
tribes.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
it
is
a
matter
of
definition.
if
one
does
not
have
a
constitutional
right,
and
this
court
has
determined
that,
one
is
not
being
deprived
of
it.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
no.
the
question
being
presented
here,
i
think
it
is
important
that
this
be
understood
too
is
not
one
of
exclusive
jurisdiction
by
the
respondents.
we
are
talking
about
here
about
that
gap
in
law
enforcement
that
occurs
when
the
only
jurisdiction
to
be
able
to
deal
with
misdemeanors
on
the
reservation
is
the
federal
government
and
the
federal
government
i
can
tell
you
and
there
is
a
history
of
this
in
the
american
union
policy
review
commission
report,
the
federal
government
has
not
been
able
to
deal
with
minor
offenses
on
indian
reservations
for
a
very
good
reason.
indian
reservations
are
generally
far
from
urban
centers.
i
can
tell
you
as
attorney
for
the
tribe
how
difficult
it
is
to
get
the
fbi
to
come
out
to
an
indian
reservation
to
investigate
something
other
than
a
major
crime.
so
the
question
is
not
one
of,
does
this
tribe
have
jurisdiction
and
no
one
else.
question
is
one
of
misdemeanor
concurrent
jurisdiction.
i
think
it
is
important
to
realize
in
the
history
of
the
cases
since
1973
when
this
case
started
that
there
are
almost
no
if
any
cases
in
any
other
indian
reservations
dealing
with
jurisdiction
over
non-indians
and
i
think
it
is
important
question.
many
tribes
in
the
amicus
brief
show
this
or
exercise
in
such
jurisdiction.
several
tribes
have
had
thousands
of
non-indians
before
their
courts
and
not
one
of
them
has
filed
a
habeas
corpus
action.
i
think
that
there
is
an
alarmist
attitude
on
the
part
of
the
attorney
general
about
what
harm
are
going
to
be
done.
for
the
most
part,
the
system
has
worked
out
quite
well.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
not
at
all,
i
am
merely
pointing
out
as
matter
of
policy.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
i
do
agree
with
that.
it
is
a
matter
of
policy.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
well,
the
attorney
general
has
raised
the
questions
of
what
i
consider
to
be
policy
on
what
way
the
misdemeanor
jurisdiction
should
be
decided
and
what
is
going
to
happen
to
the
citizens,
the
residents
of
these
reservations
and
i
am
really
countering
that
to
show
that
in
fact
nothing
serious
has
really
happened
to
cause
any
federal
court
anywhere
to
come
down
on
indian
tribe
that
is
exercising
that
jurisdiction.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
yes,
i
do
your
honor.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
mr.
gorton
attempted
to
say
that
this
court
has
never
decided
this
decision
before
and
the
answer
is
yes,
if
you
had,
we
would
not
be
here
today,
but
this
court
has
decided
other
cases
that
come
close
to
the
issue
or
deal
with
analytical
matters
that
would
come
under
that
issue.
let
us
take
united
states
v.
mazurie
decided
two
years
ago.
clearly,
it
was
a
delegation
case.
can
the
united
states
government
delegate
the
power
of
liquor
to
an
indian
tribe?
well,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
in
writing
the
opinion
does
not
really
rely
on
the
question
of
delegation
because
he
notes
that
in
order
to
delegate
a
power,
the
body
gets
receiving
it
has
to
have
some
sort
of
independent
power
over
the
matters
at
hand.
and
in
united
states
v.
mazurie
decided
two
years
ago,
this
court
held
that
indian
tribes
are
unique
aggregations,
possessing
attributes
of
sovereignty
over
both
their
members
and
their
territory
and
use
that
analysis
to
determine
that
in
fact
the
tribe
could
decide
whether
or
not
the
mazurie
is
non-indians
on
fee
pattern
land
could
sell
liquor.
i
acknowledge
it
was
a
delegation
case.
it
is
a
matter
federal
prosecution,
but
the
analysis
is
really
the
same.
do
indian
tribes
posses
these
attributes
of
sovereignty
over
their
members
and
their
territory?
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
that
is
correct.
most
attributes
what
we
call
real
sovereignty
having
given
up
by
indians
tribes.
there
is
no
question
about
it.
indian
tribes
cannot
mint
money.
they
cannot
enter
into
treaties
with
other
nations,
but
this
court
is
consistently
held
that
there
powers
that
have
not
been
taken
away.
let
me
give
you
an
example.
if
mr.
gorton
is
right
and
you
got
to
look
to
some
kind
of
federal
statute
to
determine
what
powers
the
tribe
got.
indian
tribes
would
not
be
able
to
point
to
one
single
treaty
or
statutory
enactment
which
would
justify
the
exercise
of
most
their
powers
including
powers
which
this
court
has
upheld.
morris
v.
hitchcock
is
a
pure
case
of
this
court
saying
that
even
though
the
prosecution
was
federal
because
of
the
federal
regulations
involved.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
that
is
correct.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
i
am
saying
that
in
morris
v.
hitchcock
in
1905
there
was
no
previous
decision
of
this
court.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
it
is
the
law
of
the
cases
of
this
court.
this
court
has
never
--
let
me
give
another
example.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
it
is
based
under
the
constitution
because
the
constitution
gave
the
united
states,
the
congress
the
power
to
enter
into
treaties
with
the
indian
tribes.
so,
to
the
extent
that
those
treaties
recognize
indian
tribes
has
having
been
sovereign
nations
at
one
time,
it
is
based
certainly
on
both
constitutional
provisions
and
on
treaties.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
i
do
not
think
so.
i
think
indian
tribes
are
exercising
a
sovereignty
which
is
recognized
and
reaffirmed
by
the
united
states.
last
year
you
had
a
case
here
called
fischer
v.
district
court
dealing
with
adoption
involved
indians
in
montana
and
this
court
held
that
the
tribe
in
fact
had
jurisdiction
over
that
adoption.
now,
nowhere
could
anyone
point
to
any
statute,
treaty
or
enactment
which
gave
the
northern
cheyenne
tribe
jurisdiction
over
adoption?
what
this
court
said
was
that
the
indian
reorganization
act
of
1934
which
by
the
way
does
not
at
all
give
any
powers
to
indian
tribes,
it
merely
recognizes
powers
was
sufficient,
a
sort
of
peg
upon
which
that
hang
your
hat
and
this
court
did
not
point
any
statutory
enactment
which
actually
gave
that
power
to
the
tribe.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
when
you
say
“we
are”
you
mean
the
tribe
or
--?
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
i
am
not
saying
that.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
i
am
arguing
that
the
court’s
analysis
under
those
cases
that
indian
tribes
must
retain
whatever
it
was
they
were
except
that
which
expressly
been
taken
away
by
congress,
by
treaty
or
in
analysis
of
this
court
has
to
be
viable
because
if
it
is
not,
then
indian
tribes
really
posses
almost
no
power.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
there
is
no
question
in
this.
no
decision
of
this
--
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
i
do
your
honor
if
there
had
been
a
decision
of
the
court
we
would
not
be
here
today.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
what
i
am
saying
is
that
your
analysis
which
was
correct
that
one
does
not
have
to
look
for
an
express
treaty
or
statutory
enactment
in
order
to
find
that
in
indian
tribe
has
a
power,
that
that
is
the
correct
analysis
that
this
court
has
used
over
the
years
--
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
i
point
to
mazurie
which
talks
about
tribes
having
independent
authority
to
some
extent
over
these
matters.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
it
is
impossible
to
point
--
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
yes,
the
answer
is
that
congress
has
never
--
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
that
is
correct
because
your
honor
it
is
very
difficult
to
prove
a
negative.
if
congress
has
never
enacted
a
statute
giving
a
tribe
power
and
this
court
has
recognized
the
power
how
can
i
point
to
a
statute
which
gave
the
tribe
that
power.
all
i
can
point
to
is
this
court’s
analysis
of
the
fact
that
one
does
not
need
a
statute
or
a
treaty
in
order
to
determine
if
there
is
a
power.
take
a
look
at
williams
v.
lee.
williams
v.
lee
in
1959,
this
court
said
that
a
non-indian
must
go
to
tribal
court
for
a
civil
matter
in
order
to
have
a
judgment
entered
for
him
to
be
able
to
benefit
from
a
debt
that
was
owed
to
him.
and
the
court
said
in
williams
v.
lee,
it
is
immaterial
that
respondent
is
not
an
indian.
he
was
under
reservation
and
the
transaction
with
an
indian
took
place
there
and
that
was
the
reason
of
this
court’s
decision.
now,
nowhere
can
anyone
point
to
any
statutory
enactment
which
says
that
tribal
courts
have
--
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
i
agree
your
honor.
again,
if
case
had
been
decided
in
williams
v.
lee
we
would
not
be
here.
all
i
can
do
is
rely
on
this
court’s
analysis
previously
and
it
does
not
just
--
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
yes
it
is.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
it
is
important
to
point
out
the
time
and
period
of
the
treaty
negotiation
with
point
elliott
tribes
of
which
suquamish
is
one.
it
is
very
important.
a
draft
treaty
was
prepared
in
1854
by
the
local
commissioner
of
indian
affairs,
the
governor
of
the
washington
territory,
isaac
stevens.
in
that
treaty,
was
a
specific
provision
which
said
the
tribe
will
give
up
jurisdiction,
criminal
jurisdiction
over
non-indians
and
will
have
criminal
jurisdiction
only
over
its
own
members,
a
specific
provision,
this
is
in
the
brief.
that
language
was
written
by
the
attorney
who
was
the
secretary
of
the
treaty
commission
on
december
10,
1854.
six
weeks
later,
on
january
22,
1855,
the
point
elliott
treaty
was
signed.
the
only
provisions
of
a
15-section
draft
treaty
which
had
been
written
for
the
purpose
of
negotiation,
the
only
provision
that
does
not
find
its
way
into
the
point
elliott
treaty
are
those
expressed
words
that
a
tribe
will
give
up
non-indians
--
will
not
have
a
jurisdiction
over
non-indians
and
will
turn
them
over
to
the
united
states
for
prosecution.
every
other
provision
of
the
draft
treaty
is
in
there.
there
are
even
provisions
which
are
part
of
the
article
in
which
this
language
appears
which
find
their
way
into
the
treaty.
it
is
the
only
provision
that
is
not
in
the
treaty.
certainly,
i
cannot
tell
you,
i
was
not
there,
we
do
not
have
notes.
i
cannot
tell
you
that
the
indians
were
clever
enough
in
the
1855
to
negotiate
a
way
back
because
they
knew
what
trouble
would
bring
them.
but
some
conclusion
must
be
drawn
from
the
fact
that
the
commissioners
at
that
time
and
this
is
20
years
after
the
passage
of
the
1834
trade
and
intercourse
act
felt
it
necessary
to
negotiate
and
to
put
in
to
a
treaty
a
provision
terminating
jurisdiction
which
mr.
gorton
says
had
been
terminated
20
years
before
in
1834.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
that
is
correct.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
i
do
not
believe
so
your
honor
because
one
has
to
remember,
again,
we
are
examining
pre-dated
time
of
which
we
have
a
little
record,
but
it
was
well
after
the
1854
enactment
that
the
secretary
to
the
commission,
before
they
actually
went
out
on
this
trip
to
negotiate
treaties
put
a
provision
in
not
give
the
tribe
exclusive
jurisdiction,
but
they
took
it
away.
after
the
1854
act
it
was
not
necessary
to
take
away
tribal
jurisdiction
over
non-indians
had
the
1854
enactment
actually
done
that.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
that
is
exactly
correct
and
there
are
no
treaties
--
i
do
not
take
position
by
the
way
that
we
are
talking
about
the
third
exception.
it
is
our
position,
the
government
may
have
a
different
position,
but
it
is
our
position
that
the
federal
government
in
fact
would
have
had
jurisdiction
over
these
offenses
over
both
oliphant
and
belgarde.
the
only
question
is
concurrently,
can
the
tribe
claim
jurisdiction
and
as
it
occurred
in
the
facts
of
this
situation,
employ
that
jurisdiction
when
there
is
no
one
else
around
to
do
it.
you
are
dealing
with
the
situation
where
both
offenses
occurred
in
the
middle
of
the
night.
you
are
dealing
with
the
situation
in
which
the
county
and
the
federal
government
were
asked
to
provide
law
enforcement
assistance
during
the
tribal
celebration
in
the
oliphant
case
and
the
county
gave
one
deputy
for
an
eight-hour
period
and
the
federal
government
provided
no
one.
had
the
tribal
police
not
affected
this
arrest
and
the
tribe
not
persecuted
it,
both
oliphant
and
belgarde
would
have
gone
unpunished.
in
the
belgarde
case
it
is
even
worst
because
the
tribal
police
basically
under
my
instructions
at
the
time
attempted
not
to
act
in
a
matter
which
might
bring
about
as
it
did,
a
court
case
and
the
tribal
police
called
the
state
patrol
and
the
county
sheriff
and
asked
them
to
come
that
they
have
now
made
an
arrest
of
a
person
who
is
intoxicated
and
was
speeding
through
town.
they
came,
they
said
well
this
is
a
misdemeanor
we
did
not
observe
it
and
so
therefore
we
will
not
be
prosecute.
this
is
on
the
record
and
so
you
have
a
situation,
it
is
the
perfect
situation.
the
facts
really
show
the
law
in
this
case.
had
that
tribe
not
been
able
to
make
that
arrest
and
make
that
prosecution
who
knows
what
destruction
would
have
been
occurred
on
that
night.
particularly
in
the
belgarde
case,
we
are
talking
about
an
individual
and
a
truck
speeding
and
probably
highly
intoxicated.
so,
the
answer
to
the
question
is,
no,
we
are
not
claiming
exclusive
jurisdiction.
i
can
tell
you
that
the
us
attorney,
the
federal
courts
had
really
not
much
desire
to
get
involved
in
neither
the
oliphant
nor
the
belgarde
cases
in
terms
of
a
prosecution.
they
are
relevantly
minor
offenses.
they
are
two
young
kids
and
they
are
making
some
trouble.
if
the
tribe
can
not
do
that,
particularly
when
the
other
side
of
the
offense
is
tribal
police,
tribal
property,
tribal
dignity,
a
breach
of
the
peace
not
just
for
indians,
but
for
non-indians,
if
the
tribe
can
not
do
that,
what
is
left
to
them,
but
this
homeland
that
has
been
created
for
them?
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
the
state
on
the
oliphant
case
was
on
(voice
overlap)
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
under
our
strange
partial
jurisdiction
statute
there
would
be
no
jurisdiction
over
oliphant.
in
the
belgarde
case,
but
for
the
yakama
case
which
the
court
has
already
acknowledged
the
state
might
also
have
jurisdiction,
but
in
this
case
they
refused
to
do
anything
about
it,
even
though
at
the
time
the
yakama
case
had
not
been
decided.
what
you
find
is
--
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
that
is
correct.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
that
is
correct
your
honor,
but
we
have
never
had
the
problem.
the
state
i
think
is
certain
responsible
and
the
county
certainly
will
not
let
a
felony
go
unpunished.
when
you
are
talking
about
minor
offenses,
mostly
which
affect
the
tribe
not
the
county
and
which
the
land
involved
for
the
most
part
is
non-taxable
land,
the
county
is
getting
no
income
from
it
-
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
he
was
aiming
at
everyone.[laughter]
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
he
was
aiming
at
everyone.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
he
was
aiming
at
everyone.
i
think
if
he
happened
to
pick
the
indian
and
he
would
hit
the
indian,
but
he
was
aiming
at
everyone
and
that
is
the
very
question,
why
was
not
the
county
interested
enough
to
get
involve
and
to
prosecute?
as
i
said,
on
my
advise,
the
tribe
was
not
going
to
prosecute
until
it
became
a
matter
of
assault
on
the
dignity
of
the
tribe,
that
everyone
in
the
community
would
look
and
know
that
you
can
violate
the
law
in
the
reservation
and
there
would
be
no
retribution
whatsoever,
no
kind
of
punishment.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
that
is
an
interesting
question
your
honor.
i
really
do
not
know
that
they
can
to
be
honest
with
you.
i
had
been
trying
to
do
that
because
i
thought
it
would
be
a
benefit
to
me
to
come
in
with
a
most
narrow
case
that
i
can
possibly
come
in
with,
but
to
be
intellectually
honest,
i
do
not
think
you
really
can
and
i
do
not
think
that
you
should.
let
me
give
an
example
if
i
may.
take
the
northern
cheyenne
tribe
in
montana
which
have
much
more
trust
land,
3000
indians,
almost
no
non-indians,
coal
is
about
to
be
developed
on
that
reservation.
it
is
going
to
bring
an
influx
of
25,000
non-indians,
probably
to
develop
that
coal.
the
county
seat
is
at
least
60
to
70,
perhaps
over
a
hundred
miles
away,
billings
is
about
150
miles
away.
now,
you
picture
what
is
going
to
that
reservation,
the
25,000
non-indian
workers
to
come
on
to
a
reservation
of
three
indians,
a
half-million
hectares
and
get
involved
in
the
kinds
of
things
that
people
get
involved
in,
and
the
tribe
is
powerless
to
act.
so,
while
the
port
madison
case,
we
admit
that
the
tribe
is
still
there,
it
has
always
been
recognized,
it
has
never
been
terminated,
there
is
a
statute,
no
agreement
or
statute
doing
that,
the
principle
of
law
though,
whether
it
would
be
civil
regulation
or
criminal
regulation
can
be
better
seen
a
situation
like
that.
tribes
have
not
done
this
before.
there
is
no
question
about
this.
the
dissent
in
the
ninth
circuit
in
oliphant
makes
it
very
clear
that
its
position
is
if
this
all
true,
why
did
it
not
happen
earlier
and
there
are
several
answers.
one
is
until
1968
you
had
no
remedy,
i
think
the
court
is
already
pointed
that
out,
talton
v.
mayes
said
you
had
no
constitutional
rights
and
the
second
reason
and
perhaps
the
more
important
reason,
is
that
until
the
1960s,
indian
tribes
depended
on
the
federal
government.
this
court
said
in
mancory
v.
morton,
just
two
years
ago,
talked
about
materialistic
attitude
of
the
federal
government
and
the
fact
that
indian
interest
basically
suffered
because
the
federal
government
said
to
indians
we
will
take
care
of
you.
well,
the
american
indian
policy
review
commission
report
and
other
things
that
this
court
can
take
note
of
shows
how
the
federal
government
took
care
of
the
indians.
the
concept
to
self-determination
basically
is
a
concept
that
the
tribes
have
been
upgrading
on
over
the
last
10
years,
and
that
is
the
federal
government
is
not
going
to
do
it
force,
but
going
to
have
do
it
ourselves
and
congress
has
recognized
this.
you
know
that
suquamish
tribe
is
the
recipient
of
all
revenue
sharing
funds
for
the
entire
reservation,
so
any
programs
that
they
have
had
to
be
for
all
the
members
of
the
reservation.
the
suquamish
tribe
is
the
recipient.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
that
is
right
your
honor,
all
the
residents
of
the
reservation.
in
other
words,
the
formula
that
is
used
for
determining
how
much
money
the
tribe
will
get
by
the
federal
government,
by
congress
is
the
number
of
residents
in
the
reservation,
not
the
number
of
indians.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
that
money
then
goes
to
the
tribe
which
then
has
to
account
for
them
in
terms
of
the
programs
that
revenue
sharing
money
is
used
for.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
kinds
of
programs
that
are
involved
are,
first
of
all,
a
good
deal
of
the
money
is
used
for
law
enforcement
because
that
is
the
major
problem
there.
there
is
money
used
for
social
services
for
social
workers.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
by
the
tribe
because
that
is
considered
from
the
federal
government
as
the
local
government
of
the
reservation.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
that
is
correct.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
for
the
tribal
use
for
all
residents
of
the
reservation,
law
enforcement
on
the
reservation,
the
tribal
police
officers
and
there
are
10
not
three.
tribal
police
officers
and
the
three
tribal
police
cars
go
through
the
entire
reservation.
they
do
not
stop
and
this
court
pointed
out
for
instance
in
moe
and
in
seamore
v.
superintendent
(ph)
the
problems
of
trying
to
use
a
track
book
in
going
through
an
indian
reservation
to
determine
whether
or
not
you
are
on
trust
land
or
field
land.
think
of
how
much
worst
would
be
if
they
got
to
get
out
genealogical
chart
at
the
same
time
and
before
they
made
an
arrest
they
had
to
look
and
see
first
of
all
is
it
free
or
trust
land,
secondly,
is
it
a
member
the
tribe
or
not.
they
cannot
even
rely
on
the
fact
that
he
is
an
indian,
because
an
indian
on
the
reservation
--
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
the
situation
would
apply
to
felonies
too,
but
the
tribe
--
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
the
situation
would
apply
to
felonies
also,
but
as
to
felonies,
the
tribe
basically
has
not
been
involved
in
any
kind
of
prosecution.
the
tribe
has
allowed
and
hope
that
the
federal
government
and
state
will
take
that
over.
the
point
i
am
making
is
that
a
law
would
apply
and
that
is
why
very
quickly
to
deal
with
the
fifteenth
amendment
question,
that
is
why
it
is
an
irrelevant
question.
indian
is
not
a
racial
classification.
this
court
is
already
decided
that
in
mancory
v.
morton,
indian
is
a
political
status.
a
man
can
be
barely
an
indian
in
terms
of
his
blood
and
be
a
member
of
the
tribe,
and
therefore,
come
under
the
definition
of
indian
and
at
the
same
time
another
man
can
be
a
full
blood
indian
but
a
member
of
the
different
tribe,
and
he
would
be
in
the
same
status
as
the
non-indian
resident
of
the
reservation,
let
us
make
that
very
clear.
we
are
talking
about
a
political
status
not
a
racial
classification.
i
believe,
that
if
this
court
were
to
examine
the
authorities
that
are
in
our
brief
and
is
a
very
complicated
issue,
i
acknowledge
that,
it
is
one
that
is
never
been
decided
by
the
court
before,
we
would
not
be
here
and
the
court
would
take
its
own
analysis
in
related
areas
and
more
important,
the
court
would
have
take
a
look
at
something
like
the
american-indian
policy
review
commission
report,
the
court
would
see
that
without
this
kind
of
jurisdiction,
indian
reservations
already
a
very
difficult
place
to
live
for
an
indian,
indian
reservations
are
going
to
be
even
more
difficult
for
an
indian
to
live
in
and
for
an
indian
tribe
would
be
able
to
--
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
that
you
honor
would
depend
on
the
supposition
that
non-indians
will
not
receive
justice
in
indian
tribal
courts,
and
i
would
venture
to
say
that
the
justice
that
is
given
out
in
indian
tribal
courts
is
equal
to
or
surpasses
the
justice
given
out
in
the
most
jp
courts,
justice
of
the
peace
courts
through
out
this
country,
talking
about
most
part
of
minor
offenses
and
misdemeanors.
i
would
venture
to
say
that
any
non-indian
who
felt
he
was
not
getting
--
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
that
is
correct
your
honor.
i
can
not
find
anything.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
i
cannot
--
but
--
i
can
cite
the
american-indian
policy
review
commission
report
which
i
think
the
court
should
address
itself
to
because
that
is
what
it
says
what
the
situation
is.
i
think
that
the
non-indians
have
available
to
them
the
indians
civil
rights
act
and
i
think
that
that
law
will
develop.
we
had
suggested
for
instance
in
our
brief,
the
concept
of
a
tribal
subject
matter
interest
test
for
this
court
to
establish
which
is
really
what
you
have
been
using
where
the
tribe
has
an
interest
and
it
can
show,
where
it
is
not
totally
unrelated
to
the
tribe,
then
the
tribe
will
have
jurisdiction
and
we
have
used
for
instance
the
long
arm
jurisdiction
kinds
of
cases
of
this
court.
we
had
used
the
taxing
of
foreign
corporation
cases.
we
had
used
the
cases
that
talk
about
when
the
state
can
get
involved
in
the
interstate
commerce.
cases
that
show
that
this
court
is
concerned
about
a
local
government
having
sufficient
authority
to
be
able
to
maintain
peace,
dignity
and
law
within
their
area.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
we
represent
a
number
of
tribes
and
two
tribes,
clients
of
ours
requested
that
we
file
an
amicus
brief
on
the
issue
only
a
public
law
280
jurisdiction.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
well,
we
could
have
put
it
in
our
original
brief
your
honor,
but
the
united
states
had
informed
us
that
they
were
going
to
request
that
matter
not
be
heard
as
part
of
this
case
since
it
was
an
ancillary
issue.
it
was
never
decide
about
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case
and
we
felt
rather
than
burden
the
court
with
a
very
long
brief,
that
it
made
more
sense
to
incorporate
by
reference
and
amicus
brief
would
set
up
the
arguments,
should
the
court
want
to
hear
them.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
we
have
done
that
once
before
in
this
court,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
tunascot
(ph)
v.
state
of
washington,
a
number
of
tribes
filed
amicus
briefs
on
issues
which
were
ancillary
to
the
basic
issue.
we
feel
that
our
clients
certainly
have
a
right
to
be
represented,
and
even
though
we
happen
to
be
counsel
for
both
sides
and
i
did
not
write
the
amicus
brief,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
that
is
correct
your
honor.
i
did
not
know
that
it
was
improper
and
if
it
is
we
certain
would
not
do
it
again.
we
really
were
trying
to
relieve
the
court
of
the
burden
of
a
very
long
brief
on
what
were
really
two
separate
issues,
one
of
which
has
been
briefed
very
thoroughly
in
another
case.
mr.
barry
d.
ernstoff
no,
it
is
exact
the
same
position.
we
incorporate
it
by
reference
in
our
brief.
again,
it
is
a
long
drawn
out
explanation
of
something
that
we
felt
the
court
might
want
to
refer
it
to,
but
not
have
it
in
front
of
it
at
all
times.
thank
you
your
honors.
