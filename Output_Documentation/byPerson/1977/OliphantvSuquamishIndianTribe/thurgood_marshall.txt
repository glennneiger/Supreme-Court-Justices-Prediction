justice
thurgood
marshall
was
it
not
fairly
marked
as
a
police
vehicle?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
this
man
was
running
away
from
a
police
vehicle?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he
run
into
then,
did
he
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
ran
into
them,
that
was
worse?
he
was
not
trying
to
escape
when
he
ran
into
them
or
did
i
misunderstand
what
you
said?
you
said
they
were
chasing
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
in
doing
the
pursuit,
that
is
a
good
word,
he
run
into
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he
run
into
a
police
car
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
did?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
it
was
clearly
marked?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
a
little
late,
is
it
not,
they
should
have
put
a
restrictive
cognizant
back
in
1600
and
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
malone,
i
get
that
you
are
arguing
what
should
be
argued
to
congress
and
not
to
a
court,
now
show
me
that
i
am
wrong?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
said
that
tribal
civil
rights,
the
indian
civil
rights
law,
did
you
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
going
to
get
to
that
point?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
there
is
nothing
in
legislation
history
on
that
point?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
would
be
the
same
if
they
had
been
arrested
by
fbi
agent?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
attorney
general
(voice
overlap)
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
i
misunderstood
you.
did
you
say
that
congress
could
give
indians
this
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
would
concede
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what
do
you
do
about
all
the
army
camps?
justice
thurgood
marshall
some
federal
magistrate
is
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
for
the
federal
magistrate
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
none
of
this
would
settle
this
case,
will
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
all
could
have
been
handled
by
not
arresting
these
men?[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
not
those
constitutional
rights
were
individual
and
did
not
depend
on
how
many
people
exercised
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
do
we
have
to
do
with
policy?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think,
what
the
attorney
general
said
you
either
look
to
a
statute
or
treaty
or
a
decision
of
this
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
are
now
about
decision
of
the
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
your
piggyback
argument
is
that
where
we
want
to
something
without
power,
we
are
therefore
authorized
to
continue
to
act
without
power?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
what
you
are
arguing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
also
admit
that
there
is
no
decision
of
this
court
that
says
that
an
indian
tribe
has
authority
to
punish
a
misdemeanor
who
is
not
an
indian?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
do
want
us
to
extend,
do
you
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
we
would
keep
on
arguing
that
we
did
not
have
power
to
do
what
we
did,
how
can
you
argue
we
have
power
to
do
more?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now
what
do
you
point
to?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
do
you
point
to
other
than
an
opinion
of
this
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
the
answer
is
you
do
not
have
anything?
justice
thurgood
marshall
your
answer
is
you
do
not
have
anything?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
what
you
point
to
a
constitution
provision
is
that
there
is
difference
between
civil
and
criminal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
happens
after
the
state
refuses
to
prosecute
a
felony?
what
can
the
tribe
do?
nothing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
why
do
you
say
that
it
is
so
difficult
with
a
misdemeanor?
if
they
file
as
to
act
in
a
felony
it
would
be
much
more
demonstrated,
he
may
able
to
run
while
shooting
people?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
this
man
driving
down
the
road
aiming
at
indians
only?
justice
thurgood
marshall
sir?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh!
i
thought
so.
justice
thurgood
marshall
may
i
ask
again,
does
that
apply
to
felonies
too?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
can
see
that,
you
make
these
arguments,
when
you
realize
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
citing
what
to
back
that
up
other
than
you
are
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
case
is
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
but
your
firm
is
in
it
and
you
are
a
partner
in
the
firm?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
could
all
get
together
and
vote
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
is
their
answer,
but
the
petitioners
in
this
case,
they
were
not
allowed
to
vote
on?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
my
own
point
is,
you
said
there
was
no
way
for
the
tribe
to
do
it
and
i
said,
the
tribe
can
pass
its
own
laws,
that
is
what
the
united
states
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
no,
i
am
saying
that
the
tribe
at
its
private
council
vote
its
own
laws,
do
they
not?
