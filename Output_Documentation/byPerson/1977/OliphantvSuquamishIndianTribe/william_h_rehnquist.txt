justice
william
h.
rehnquist
counsel
what
basis
do
you
rely
on
for
federal
jurisdiction
in
this
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
what
particular
statutory
grants
of
jurisdiction
for
the
federal
district
courts
do
you
rely
on?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
do
not
mean
neither
statute
so
it
is
the
indian
civil
rights
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
primarily,
is
there
something
else
that
is
secondary?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
to
whom
may
that
be.
do
you
not
have
to
be
in
custody
either
in
a
federal
or
state
commitment
in
order
to
rely
on
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
contend
that
your
client
was
in
custody
under
either
federal
or
state
commitment
in
this
situation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
he
was
detained
by
the
indians
is
it
your
contention
that
it
was
the
same
as
if
he
had
been
detained
by
the
federal
government?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
offense
really,
he
was
charged
with
an
altercation
between
himself
and
the
indian
tribal
policeman?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
who
was
an
indian
tribal
policeman?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
effect
would
be
quite
different
in
the
port
madison
reservation
on
the
one
hand
which
your
client
came
into
contact
with
than
the
reservation
like
the
navajo
reservation
which
is
20,000
square
miles,
largely
populated
with
indians,
would
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
it
your
contention
that
the
provision
for
the
right
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
indian
civil
rights
act
permits
one
to
raise
in
that
writ,
rights
other
than
those
that
are
conferred
by
the
indians
civil
rights
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
was
curios
to
know
whether
you
thought
that
the
express
provision
in
the
indian
civil
rights
acts
granting
the
right
of
federal
jurisdiction
to
hear
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
on
behalf
of
someone
detained
by
an
indian
tribe
permitted
that
person
to
raise
claims
other
than
those
granted
by
the
indians
civil
rights
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
chickasaws
are
who
won
the
five
civilized
choice?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
your
responses
to
mr.
justice
white’s
question
all
depend
on
implication,
do
they
not,
that
congress
saw
fit
to
confer
particular
jurisdiction
on
federal
courts
in
certain
situations,
then
on
indian
tribes
in
other
situations
and
if
that
had
existed
independently
of
congressional
action,
congress
would
have
not
gone
ahead
and
done
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
ask
you
one
question
general
gorton.
your
argument
would
apply
equally
i
supposed
to
the
20,000
square
miles
of
the
navajo
reservation
as
some
person
driving
from
phoenix
to
denver
and
spending
about
120
miles
on
the
roads
going
through
that
reservation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
ones
in
the
sixth
circuit
are
not
crazy
about
prosecuting
a
black
lung
cases
either
i
take
it?[laughter]
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
do
not
think
this
is
an
act
of
congress,
do
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
fundamental
difference
between
you
and
your
opponent
is
who
has
the
burden
of
proof
with
congress
as
i
understand
it.
your
opponents
say
unless
congress
has
conferred
jurisdiction
on
the
indian
tribe,
they
do
not
have
it
and
you
say
unless
congress
has
taken
it
away,
they
do
have
it
and
i
do
not
see
how
this
report
really
moves
the
ball
one
way
or
the
other?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
this
case
is
here
now,
not
five
years
from
now?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
you
remember
of
moose
latch
and
a
grand
master
latch
up
in
a
men’s
room
overnight
you
are
not
being
deprive
of
any
constitutional
right,
are
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
to
say
that
a
tribe
possesses
an
attribute
of
sovereignty,
does
not
necessarily
possesses
all
attributes
itself?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
ernstoff,
is
there
any
way
of
distinguishing
your
case
from
a
civil
jurisdiction
of
the
tribe,
so
that
the
court
could
enter
principal
way
will
say
there
was
criminal
jurisdiction
here,
but
not
civil
jurisdiction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
was
changed
at
all
by
the
first
sentence
of
the
first
amendment
--
of
all
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
reads
“all
persons
born
or
naturalized
in
the
united
states
and
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
thereof
are
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
state
wherein
they
reside?”
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
think
that
there
is
no
negative
implication
of
ruling
out
other
sovereignties
than
the
united
states
or
the
state
in
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
subject
to
the
major
crimes
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
indians
civil
rights
act
did
not
take
away
from
them
the
power
to
punish
for
major
crimes,
it
just
said
you
cannot
sentence
a
person
convicted
of
first-degree
murder
for
more
than
six
months.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
gorton
before
1868,
the
state
of
washington
could
have
hanged
an
indian
or
a
white
man
without
offering
him
any
constitutional
rights
at
all,
could
they
not,
because
there
was
no
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
this
case
which
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit,
the
petitioners
are
two
non-indian
residents
of
the
port
madison
indian
reservation
in
the
state
of
washington.
the
reservation
is
the
tribal
home
of
the
suquamish
indians
who
are
the
respondents
in
this
case.
pursuant
to
a
law
and
order
court,
that
the
tribal
government
adopted
in
1973.
tribal
officers
arrested
the
petitioners
in
1974
for
violating
various
criminal
provisions
of
that
court.
the
petitioners
applied
for
writs
of
habeas
corpus
the
united
state's
district
court
for
the
district
of
washington
and
seattle
on
the
ground
that
the
suquamish
indian
provisional
court
does
not
have
jurisdiction
over
non-indians.
the
district
court
rejected
petitioner's
argument
and
denied
the
petitioners.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
the
district
court's
rulings.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
respondents
that
is
the
tribe
do
not
point
any
treaty
provision
or
congressional
statute
giving
the
suquamish
indians
criminal
jurisdiction
over
non-indians.
instead
they
contend
that
indian
tribes
have
inherent
jurisdiction
to
try
non-indians
as
part
of
their
original
sovereignty.
but
indian
tribes
retain
only
that
sovereignty
which
is
neither
terminated
by
congress
nor
inconsistent
with
their
status.
by
submitting
to
the
overriding
sovereignty
of
the
united
states
indian
tribes
necessarily
gave
up
their
power
to
try
non-indians
citizens
of
the
united
states
except
in
a
manner,
acceptable
to
congress.
this
fact
has
long
been
recognized
as
we
point
out
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
by
congress
the
executive
branch
in
the
lower
federal
court.
mr.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which,
the
chief
justice
joins.
mr.
justice
brennan
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
