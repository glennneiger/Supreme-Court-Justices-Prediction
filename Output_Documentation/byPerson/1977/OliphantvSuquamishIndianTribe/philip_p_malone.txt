on
behalf
of
the

mark
oliphant
and
daniel
belgarde,
attorney
general
gorton
and
myself
will
divide
arguments
of
first
impression
before
this
court
in
the
history
of
united
states,
that
is
as
indian
tribe
inherent
governmental
criminal
police
powers
over
non-indian
persons,
citizens
of
the
united
states
for
their
actions
occurring
within
the
boundaries
of
an
indian
reservation.
i
will
first
discuss
the
facts
and
then
argue
the
issues
involved
under
the
fifth
and
the
fifteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
and
the
indian
civil
rights
act
of
1968
which
protects
the
privileges,
rights
and
freedom
of
the
petitioners
as
non-indians,
non-members
of
the
tribe
from
the
exercise
of
such
powers
claimed
by
the
respondents
in
this
case.

mr.

but
there
is
a

from

which
--
mr.

p.

yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
philip
p.

he
was
for
a
period
of

then
he

yes,

the
port
madison
reservation
is
located
entirely
within
kitsap
county,
washington,
approximately
10
miles
across
the
waters
of
puget
sound
from
downtown
seattle.
among
the
public
services
provide
by
the
county
and
the
state
for
the
reservation
as
in
any
other
area,
not
within
the
indian
reservation
are
schools,
roads,
public
utilities,
fire
protection,
social
and
health
services
and
law
enforcement.
the
suquamish
tribe
provides
no
service
as
such
to
non-indians
except
the
police
protection
and
law
enforcement
of
tribal
laws
that
are
claimed
in
this
case.
the
reservation
is
similar
to
the
pearl
river
indian
reservation
(ph)
with
which
this
court
i
am
sure
is
familiar.
the
land
area
of
the
reservation
is
approximately
7,300
acres.
two-thirds
of
that
land
is
owned
by
non-indians
and
some
indians
in
fee
and
that
is
subject
to
local
taxes
for
payment
of
public
services.
one-third
of
the
land
approximately
is
individually
owned,
a
lot
of
land
with
title
held
in
trust
by
the
united
states
for
the
protection
of
those
individual
indian
allottees
and
it
is
exempt
from
taxation
and
i
may
note
to
make
a
distinguishing
factor
of
these
allotments
arose
here
primarily
under
the
treaty
of
point
elliott.
mr.
philip
p.
malone
no,
there
is
not.
mr.
philip
p.
malone
there
used
to
be.
there
was
contemplated
a
termination
date
and
as
i
understand
congress
extended
that
period.
mr.
philip
p.
malone
indefinitely.
in
1973,
the
time
of
the
oliphant
incident,
the
tribe
had
leased
to
a
non-indian
corporation
with
approval
of
the
united
states,
the
last
remaining
unoccupied,
unallotted
trust
lands
on
the
reservation
and
all
that
there
was
a
portion
known
as
the
ball
park
and
that
is
where
the
oliphant
incident
took
place.
as
of
1973,
only
50
adult
and
minor
tribal
members
lived
on
the
reservation
or
inter-dispersed
in
residential
areas
among
in
approximately
non-indian
residential
population
of
3,000
people.
no
distinct
community
occupying
any
certain
area
existed
anywhere
on
the
reservation
in
1973.
in
1965,
a
total
enrolled
membership
of
112
tribal
members
entitled
to
vote
in
tribal
elections,
fifty-six
members
elected
and
adapted
a
constitution
for
the
tribe
as
authorized
by
the
indian
reorganization
act
of
1934
and
approved
by
the
secretary
of
interior.
it
provides
for
a
limited
powers
of
government
by
a
general
council
and
in
a
tribal
council.
franchise
to
vote
is
in
the
general
council
and
through
an
election
by
the
members
they
also
elect
pastors
in
the
tribal
counsel.
the
limitation
on
voting
and
membership
is
that
they
must
be
1/8th
indian
blood
and
generally
18
years
or
over.
the
tribal
council
as
such
is
the
executive
branch
of
the
general
council.
because
of
the
limited
executive
powers
of
the
tribal
ordinances
that
is
governing
the
indians
in
the
constitution
which
restricts
in
effect
the
executive
body
to
regulate
in
hunting
and
fishing
and
shell
fishing,
ordinances
may
be
promulgated
through
via
tribal
council
provided
the
secretary
of
interior
approves.
therefore,
the
most
recent
ordinances
relevant
to
this
case
have
been
passed
by
a
general
council
of
all
of
the
eligible
voters
and
members
of
the
tribe.
in
july
1973,
members
of
the
general
councils
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
the
tribe
adapted
a
law
and
order
code
asserting
tribal
territorial
jurisdiction
as
an
act,
code
of
self
determination
overall
indians
and
non-indians
in
their
lands
within
the
reservation.
the
code
was
not
approved
by
the
secretary
of
interior.
tribal
crimes
are
defined
in
the
code
that
includes
not
only
major
offenses
and
not
only
minor
offenses,
but
also
major
offenses.
amongst
all
major
offenses
are
assaults,
burglary,
theft,
and
rape.
at
the
same
time,
the
code
provides
the
tribal
courts
established
in
the
code
do
not
have
jurisdiction
over
offenses
within
the
major
crimes
act
of
the
united
states.
since
the
major
crimes
act
applies
only
to
offenses
by
indian
offenders,
the
tribal
court
therefore,
has
jurisdiction
under
the
code
only
over
non-indians,
but
not
indians
for
those
major
tribal
offenses
as
defined
in
the
law
and
order
code.
the
code
established
a
judicial
system
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
the
tribe
providing
for
a
tribal
court
and
appellate
court,
where
judges
are
the
same.
they
must
be
tribal
members
and
have
no
further
education
qualifications
than
having
graduated
from
high
school.
their
salaries
are
paid
from
funds
in
the
united
states.
at
the
same
time
we
note
that
the
members
of
the
jury
by
a
recent
enactment
of
the
tribe
must
also
be
members
of
the
tribe
and
by
being
members
of
the
tribe
that
means
they
must
have
1/8th
indian
blood
or
more.
in
august
of
1973,
mr.
oliphant,
a
non-indian
residing
on
the
reservation
when
the
alleged
violation
took
place
by
him
on
the
reservation.
for
years
prior
to
1973,
a
local
american
legion
had
sponsored
this
event.
it
was
known
as
chief
seattle
days
and
they
also
took
place
generally
in
this
ball
park
area.
this
was
where
the
incident
took
place
in
the
oliphant
case.
at
that
time,
mr.
oliphant
became
involved
in
altercation
with
campers
on
the
ball
park
that
were
attending
that
event.
the
record
does
not
indicate
that
the
campers
involved
in
altercation
with
him
were
tribal
members.
he
was
arrested
and
charged
by
newly
appointed
tribal
police
officers,
not
for
the
altercation
with
the
campers,
but
for
assaulting
one
of
the
police
officers
in
resisting
arrest.
due
to
lack
of
jail
facilities,
he
was
then
imprisoned
in
the
city
of
bremerton
jail
off
the
reservation
for
five
days.
pursuant
to
contract
that
have
been
made
by
the
federal
government
with
the
city
of
bremerton
for
the
benefit
of
the
tribe
and
the
jailed
prisoners
of
the
tribe.
mr.
philip
p.
malone
he
was
charged
with
resisting
an
arrest
and
assaulting
one
of
those
police
officers.
mr.
philip
p.
malone
yes.
mr.
philip
p.
malone
there
are
two
judges.
mr.
philip
p.
malone
at
the
time,
there
were
a
number
of
appointed
deputies
and
at
the
present
time
i
think
there
are
three
or
four
police
officers.
mr.
philip
p.
malone
they
have
appointed
a
clerk.
the
courthouse
was
in
a
belgarde
case
was
a
barbershop.
mr.
philip
p.
malone
no
jail
facility.
mr.
philip
p.
malone
they
held
mr.
--
during
the
period
of
time
after
the
arrest
they
held
mr.
oliphant
in
the
local
office,
a
tribal
office
in
a
back
room.
mr.
philip
p.
malone
the
united
states.
part
of
the
funds,
as
i
understand,
part
of
the
funds,
tribal
funds
are
raised,
one
from
the
lease
in
the
land
and
also
from
the
operation
of
cigarette
store
and
--
mr.
philip
p.
malone
as
far
as
law
and
order
court
it
says
by
appointment.
so
i
assume
that
the
executive
branch
of
the
tribe,
the
tribal
council
appoint
judges
and
as
i
understand
the
executive
branch
is
a
chairman,
four
people,
vice
chairman
and
so
on.
the
point
of
through
that,
i
know
of
no
restrictions
otherwise.
mr.
belgarde
also,
a
non-indian,
residing
on
the
reservation
in
1974
when
he
was
arrested
by
the
tribal
police.
he
was
driving
his
automobile
on
the
public
highway
at
the
time
tribal
police
cars
took
pursuit
of
him.
a
roadblock
was
set
up
by
those
police
on
a
public
highway,
on
non-indian
land,
within
the
reservation
to
apprehend
him.
belgardeâ€™s
case,
his
car
collided
with
one
of
the
police
cars
and
he
was
arrested
and
charged
with
recklessly
endangering
a
police
officer
and
damaging
the
police
car.
he
again
was
jailed
some
50
miles
--
mr.
philip
p.
malone
i
can
answer
for
certain
because
the
exact
words
of
the
charge
is
a
public
car
and
that
i
believe
there
was
a
contract
with
united
states
government
for
supplying
of
police
vehicles
and
whether
the
title
of
that
police
vehicle
was
in
the
united
states
government
or
in
the
tribe,
i
am
uncertain.
mr.
philip
p.
malone
yes,
it
was.
mr.
philip
p.
malone
that
would
be
a
matter
of
interpretation.
mr.
philip
p.
malone
he
would
not
run
away
from
them,
he
ran
into
them.
mr.
philip
p.
malone
yes,
pursuit
is
taking
place.
mr.
philip
p.
malone
a
roadblock
then
had
taken
place.
he
perused
to
take
--
mr.
philip
p.
malone
yes.
mr.
philip
p.
malone
yes.
mr.
philip
p.
malone
yes.
well
in
short,
looking
at
the
constitutional
situations
here
we
have
a
tribal
government
that
may
be
characterized
as
governing
all
the
non-indians
on
the
reservation,
by
some
indians
and
four
some
indians
with
that
system
subsidized
by
the
federal
government.
this
then
leads
to
the
constitution
problems
involved
in
this
case.
i
would
first
bring
these
problems
in
perspective.
my
clients
and
a
number
of
non-indians
have
no
immediate
interest
in
voting
in
suquamish
general
council.
their
immediate
interest
is
to
be
free
from
the
tribal
laws
and
their
enforcement
promulgated
without
their
consent.
they
do
not
want
to
be
subject
to
independent
tribal
powers
over
which
they
have
no
control
except
with
resort
to
the
judiciary,
but
if
they
maybe
not
left
alone,
if
they
are
to
be
subject
to
tribal
criminal
code,
then
the
best
choice
would
be
that
they
would
have
the
right
to
vote
which
i
believe
and
argue
that
they
have
under
the
constitution.
this
would
mean
in
effect
if
non-indians
were
entitled
to
vote,
the
very
purpose
of
the
claimed
powers
here
or
self
determinations
of
tribes
would
end
on
such
reservations
as
a
port
madison
indian
reservation.
but
if
the
choice
has
to
be
made
for
their
freedom,
they
would
desire
the
choice
and
power
and
ability
to
vote.
mr.
philip
p.
malone
it
would
be
startlingly
different.
mr.
philip
p.
malone
i
believe
that
qualifying
my
statement
is
that
first
to
have
powers,
you
should
have
a
community
that
you
should
represent,
that
is
not
in
this
case.
mr.
philip
p.
malone
yes,
i
am
to
a
certain
extent.
i
would
say
that
as
part
of
the
constitution,
the
constitution
principles
apply
here.
they
apply
to
the
navajo
indian
reservation,
if
they
are
surely
similar
claims
over
non-indians.
mr.
philip
p.
malone
that
is
true.
mr.
philip
p.
malone
i
believe
that
the
powers
of
the
tribe
should
come
from
right,
should
come
from
the
treaty
or
acts
of
congress
and
not
by
implication
or
desire.
that
would
be
the
first
limitation,
so
if
the
treaty
--
in
certain
treaties
they
do
provide
powers
to
exclude,
they
powers
to
exclude
people
from
their
lands.
mr.
philip
p.
malone
i
think
that
becomes
difficult.
mr.
philip
p.
malone
i
would
guess.
mr.
philip
p.
malone
well
--
mr.
philip
p.
malone
yes.
mr.
philip
p.
malone
yes.
mr.
philip
p.
malone
well,
there
has
been
complete
county
protection.
mr.
philip
p.
malone
local
county
law
enforcement
--
mr.
philip
p.
malone
they
were
at
the
scene
at
the
belgarde
case
yes
and
there
were
tribal
police
cars
(inaudible)
the
oliphant
case
that
took
place.
well
in
short,
as
for
the
constitution
issues
involved
here,
i
think
they
are
quiet
clear
your
honor.
one
is
the
fifteenth
amendment
of
the
right
to
vote.
the
fifth
amendment
also
protects
my
clients
because
of
federal
action.
cases
have
been
cited
in
the
briefs.
there
is
a
direct
connection
between
federal
government
and
the
tribe
here.
mr.
philip
p.
malone
it
reads
the
right
of
determine
the
tribal
orders
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
tribal
orders,
but
does
that
â€“
my
--
mr.
philip
p.
malone
yes,
i
believe
that
the
purpose
of
the
indian
civil
rights
act
was
to
give
protection
to
any
person
by
tribal
order
of
the
court
and
it
was
not
just
restricted
to
those
rights
in
the
civil
rights
act,
but
section
8
of
the
civil
rights
act
in
effect
is
the
same
in
word
language
as
the
fifth
amendment
protections.
mr.
philip
p.
malone
i
have
no
answer
to
that
as
to
legislative
history.
mr.
philip
p.
malone
i
agree.
mr.
philip
p.
malone
attorney
general
will
take
that
up
in
statutory
issues
because
there
is
no
inherent
sovereignty
and
the
court
holds
that.
obviously
we
do
not
have
this
constitution
issues
before
the
court.
with
that
if
there
are
no
further
questions
--
