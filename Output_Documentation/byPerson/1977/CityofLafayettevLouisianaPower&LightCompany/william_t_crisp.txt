mr.
william
t.
crisp
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
first
i
want
to
thank
you
for
indulging
me
this
time
as
well
as
mr.
carter.
i
know
you
do
not
look
with
favor
on
friends
of
yours
coming
up
and
arguing
before
you.
this
will
be
my
first
time
and
i
would
not
respond
to
begin
with
to
the
question
put
by
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
alluded
to
volume
1
of
the
first
federal
power
of
survey
in
my
brief
and
the
answer
to
your
question
about
the
number
of
different
types
of
entities
in
the
industry,
in
1962
according
to
that
volume
1
and
i
am
referring
to
page
17
of
it,
there
were
480
investor
owned
companies.
there
were
2001
in
24
cities
and
puds.
there
were
969
cooperatives
and
44
federal
distributors
of
power.
since
that
time
there
has
been
some
diminution
of
the
municipalities
and
some
addition
to
the
electric
cooperatives.
mr.
william
t.
crisp
there
are
about
200,
i
have
used
chief
justice
burger,
who
distributed
about
90%
of
the
power
that
is
attributable
to
the
investor
owned
part
of
that
segment.
i
hope
i
am
being
responsive
to
your
question.
an
event
took
place
in
1890
without
which
we
would
not
be
here
in
this
case
today.
this
court
of
course
is
familiar
with
one
of
them
which
was
the
enactment
of
sherman.
the
other
is
one
that
at
that
time
foretold
or
perhaps
foretold
easily
some
of
the
facts
that
have
emerged
to
give
rise
to
this
proceeding.
for
in
that
year,
a
line,
an
electric
line,
operating
on
alternating
current
was
opened
to
carry
480
kilo
watts
of
single
phase
power
at
4000
volts
and
a
125
cycles
per
second,
14
miles
from
klamath
falls,
oregon
to
the
city
of
portland
and
it
was
the
first
time
when
it
was
demonstrated
that
there
would
be
economic
feasibility
for
large
unit
central
station
power
in
this
nation.
it
was
over
50
years,
however,
before
the
rural
segment
of
our
society
became
accessible
to
that
great
technology
and
that
came
about
in
the
years
immediately
after
world
war
ii.
as
a
result
of
the
fact,
that
the
congress
in
1936
enacted
the
rural
electrification
act.
its
purpose
was
to
make
feasible,
electric
power
accessible
to
every
rural
american
and
for
all
practical
purposes,
that
objective
has
been
accomplished.
i
bring
you
in
the
name
of
those
co-operatives,
what
i
think
is
a
unique
situation
both
legally
and
factually
that
has
a
bearing
upon
how
this
court
should
rule
in
this
case.
in
fact,
i
say
to
you
and
perhaps
this
is
too
strong
to
start
with,
that
unless
you
resolve
the
issue
in
our
favor,
there
will
remain
an
untenable,
legal
dichotomy
because
of
these
particular
facts
and
this
particular
law
that
i
want
to
talk
about.
throughout
this
country
in
most
states,
the
municipalities
have
the
power
to
expropriate,
going
electric
business
properties
in
most
cases
co-operatives
and
in
some
states
of
electric
power
company's,
in
louisiana
they
may
do
it
with
respect
to
both
the
co-operatives
and
the
power
companies
and
they
have
done
so
many
times.
this
of
course
affords
a
due
process,
just
compensation
proceeding
whereby
there
is
remuneration
for
resulting
damage.
on
the
other
hand,
not
even
in
states,
where
such
powers
maybe
statutorily
exercised
by
either
a
municipality
or
a
public
utility
district,
may
that
power
be
exercised
lawfully
is
do
so
is
to
substantially
impair
the
national
objective
of
rural
electrification
because
to
do
so
would
be
to
frustrate
federal's
premise
of
power.
now,
what
i
am
praying
for
you
here
is
this
dichotomy,
if
louisiana
city
is
permitted
to
prevail
in
this
case.
on
the
one
hand,
even
having
the
power
to
expropriate
our
properties
through
due
process
and
pursuant
to
the
fifth
amendment,
they
cannot
go
so
far
as
to
destroy
our
properties
if
the
result
is
to
impair
the
remainder
of
what
we
do.
under
that
theory
in
this
case,
they
may
piecemeal
and
in
certain
instances
(inaudible)
and
large
spread
for
sub
division
purposes,
come
out
and
commit
acts
which
we
would
be
held
not
only
civilly,
but
criminally
accountable
for
piecemeal
or
large
spread
and
accomplish
precisely
the
same
result
without
being
redressable
under
the
sherman
act.
now,
we
say
just
this
to
you
in
conclusion,
that
is
dirty
ball.
that
is
unfair
and
one
tenant,
i
think
all
of
us
would
agree
is
a
fundamental
attempt
of
construction
is
separate
is
that
you
do
not
construe
a
statute
if
the
result
is
to
be
probably
injust,
absurd
and
unfair
and
that
is
what
we
say
to
you
will
be
the
case
if
you
rule
as
the
cities
have
asked
you
to
here.
in
part
may
i
say
whether
we
can
agree
that
this
is
a
statutory
construction
or
not,
if
what
the
cities
are
doing
in
there
tie
in
arrangements
which
is
a
per
se
violation
of
sherman
and
clayton
for
us
is
it
is
not
marilyn
in
say,
surely
if
its
not,
it
ought
to
be
marilyn
prohibitin.
