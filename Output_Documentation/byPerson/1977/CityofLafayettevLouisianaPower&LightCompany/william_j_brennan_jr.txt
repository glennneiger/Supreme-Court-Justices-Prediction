justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
just
ask?
for
example
i
know
in
my
–
the
city
in
which
i
was
born
a
very
substantial
public
parking
operation,
under
ground
parking
areas
and
around
cities
and
much
complained
by
competitors,
private
parking
operations
framed
in
as
antitrust
charges,
you
do
not
suppose
is
any
exception
for
that
sort
of
thing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
though
–
you
still
think
parker
v.
brown
applies
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
carter,
do
i
get
your
submission
is
that
unless
the
particular
municipal
activity
has
been
what
compelled
by
state
legislation,
the
parker
and
brown
does
not
apply
to
that
activity
when
performed
by
the
municipality?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
in
any
event
there
has
to
be
some
state
mandate,
you
used
the
word
mandate
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
particular
activity
has
to
be
mandated
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
carried
on
by
the
municipality,
it
has
to
be
mandate
by
the
state
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me
about
this,
my
home
state
is
a
home
rule
state.
it
has
broadest
kind
of
governmental
powers.
now,
it
carries
on
great
a
many
of
the
–
o
mentioned
one
earlier
the
parking
lot
activity,
that
sort
of
thing.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
not
mandated
by
any
state
legislation
or
by
--
except
that
it
has
home
rule
powers
which
gives
it
the
broadest
possible
governmental
power.
now,
what
about
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
for
example
that
city
entered
into
an
agreement
with
the
private
parking
lot
operators
to
fix
the
price
uniformly
at
both
municipally
operated
and
privately
operated
parking
lots?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
is
not
more
than
what
i
told
you.
it
is
just
that
it
is
home
rule
city
and
has
a
broadest
possible
home
rule
power?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
other
case
i
have
to
announce
the
city
of
lafayette
versus
louisiana,
the
louisiana
power
and
light
company
is
here
on
certiorari
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
twelve
years
ago
a
case
styled
parker
versus
brown
held
that
the
sherman
act
was
not
to
be
construed
to
prohibit
the
states
“sovereign"
from
imposing
anticompetitive
restraints
as
acts
of
government.
the
question
in
this
case
is
a
whether
municipalities
has
sub-divisions
of
states
or
also
outside
the
reach
of
the
antitrust
laws
when
they
engage
in
anti-competitive
conduct.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
petitioners,
city
of
lafayette,
louisiana
was
not
automatically
exempt
from
the
antitrust
laws
simply
by
reason
of
its
status
as
a
subdivision
of
the
state
of
louisiana
but
was
exempt
only
in
respect
of
anticompetitive
conduct
engaged
in
pursuant
to
state
policy,
formerly
adopted
by
the
state
to
displace
competition
with
regulation
or
monopoly
service.
the
court
of
appeals
therefore
remanded
the
case
for
the
district
court
to
determine
whether
the
city
of
lafayette's
alleged
anticompetitive
conduct
was
directed
by
the
state
of
louisiana
since
when
the
state
itself
has
not
directed
or
authorized
an
anticompetitive
practice
engaged
in
by
a
city.
the
city
in
exercising
its
delegated
powers
must
obey
the
antitrust
laws.our
judgment
today
affirms
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
opinion
i
have
filed
is
the
opinion
for
the
court
with
respect
to
part
1
and
opinion
with
respect
to
parts
2
and
3
only
for
justices
marshall,
powell,
stevens
and
myself.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
an
opinion
joining
part
1
of
my
opinion
and
agreeing
with
the
direction
for
remand
although
expressing
the
view
that
the
better
rule
would
be
to
deny
the
city,
the
exemption,
unless
it
appeared
that
the
state
compelled
the
anticompetitive
activity
and
that
the
city
demonstrated
that
the
exemption
is
essential
to
the
state
regulatory
scheme.
the
dissents
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
stewart.
