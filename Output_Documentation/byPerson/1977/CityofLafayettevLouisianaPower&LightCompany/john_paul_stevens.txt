talk
about
franchisees,
how
about
athletic
franchisees?
when
a
city
tries
to
get
a
ball
club
to
move
to
its
community,
is
it
acting
in
a
competitive
way
a
non-competitive
way?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
suppose
it
did,
sometimes
i
think
they
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
realize
your
principle
would
apply,
but
would
you
still
say
they
are
not
engage
in
any
kind
of
competitive
activity
when
they
seek
to
persuade
a
ball
club
to
move
to
one
city
rather
then
another,
as
an
example?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
is
that
inconsistent
with
the
antitrust
laws,
to
that
one
transit
company
operate
in
the
city?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
submit
that
for
a
example
to
be
persuasive,
you
have
to
think
of
something
that
would
violate
the
antitrust
laws
and
you
have
not
done
that
yet?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
example
is
the
city
says
that
each
of
you
to
agree
on
the
price,
we
do
not
care
what
it
is,
but
you
agree
on
a
price
and
charge
the
same
price
as
opposed
to
saying
the
price
in
this
city
for
bus
fair
shall
be
10
cents,
we
are
talking
about
the
first
example?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
think
that
should
be
okay?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
example
is
if
the
city
operates
a
bus
company
and
agrees
with
the
private
bus
company
in
a
neighboring
community
that
we
will
both
charge
a
dollar
a
ride,
then
the
city
should
be
immune
and
the
other
company
should
be
subject
to
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
your
example?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
carter
on
that
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
carter
does
your
counter
claim
allege
this
practice?
i
did
not
find
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
does.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
the
water,
so
they
get
the
water
and
the
electricity
and
the
gas?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
not
in
the
counter
claim
itself,
is
it?
