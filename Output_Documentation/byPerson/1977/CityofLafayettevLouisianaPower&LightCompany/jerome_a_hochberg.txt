mr.
jerome
a.
hochberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
cities,
political
sub-divisions
of
states
are
subject
to
causes
of
action
in
trouble-damage
liability
under
the
federal
antitrust
laws.
we
are
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
and
the
case
arises
out
of
a
complaint
filed
by
the
petitioners,
the
city
of
lafayette
and
plaquemine
charging
the
respondent,
the
louisiana
power
&
light
company,
two
other
investor
owned
utilities
and
a
parent
of
lp&l
with
violations
of
the
antitrust
laws
in
the
generation,
transmission
and
distribution
of
electric
power
and
energy.
lp&l
in
turn
filed
a
counter
claim
charging
the
cities
with
antitrust
violations
in
the
conduct
of
the
city
electric
utility
systems.
cities
moved
to
dismiss
in
the
district
court
on
the
grounds
of
parker
v.
brown
barred
any
action
under
the
federal
antitrust
laws
against
them
and
the
district
court
relying
on
parker
dismissed
the
grant
of
the
motion
and
entered
judgment
pursuant
to
rule
54
(b)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
against
lp&l.
lp&l
then
appealed
to
the
fifth
circuit
and
during
the
dependency
of
that
appeal
this
court
came
down
with
the
goldfarb
ruling.
the
fifth
circuit
then
reversed
the
district
court
relying
on
goldfarb
and
said
that
the
cities
were
not
automatically
outside
the
scope
of
antitrust
laws
and
that
in
order
to
come
within
the
state
action
doctrine,
they
would
have
to
have
had
legislative
approval
for
this
specific
conduct
under
challenge.
certiorari
was
granted
by
this
court
after
a
petition
by
the
cities.
the
cities
operate
their
electric
utility
systems,
they
own
and
operate
and
pursuant
to
broad
statutory
authority
from
the
louisiana
legislature.
what
is
involved
here
is
not
whether
cities
are
beyond
the
law,
but
simply
whether
cities
as
governmental
bodies,
wholly
governmental
bodies
are
subject
to
the
antitrust
laws
and
they
travel
down
to
the
judgments
that
come
with
them
for
conduct
engaged
in
by
city
officials
in
the
official
performance
of
their
duties.
in
addition,
we
are
not
here
just
talking
about
electric
utility
service
for
the
city,
we
are
talking
about
the
myriad
of
services
in
operation
that
the
cities
engage
in.
in
order
to
make
this
determination
it
seems
to
me,
this
court
has
said
in
parker
v.
brown
that
because
the
statute
itself
does
not
answer
the
question
in
specific
words
that
we
must
look
to
the
statutory
purpose
to
legislative
history,
the
subject
matter
and
the
context
of
the
statute.
i
think
we
should
also
look
to
the
adverse
effects,
a
weird
adverse
effects
from
enforcement
of
these
laws
against
city
officials
and
city
governments
and
the
impingement
that
it
will
create
on
a
fundamental
policy
in
this
country,
the
policy
of
local
choice
in
ordering
social
and
economic
needs,
in
providing
local
choice
on
matters,
on
governmental
matters
closest
to
the
people.
in
parker,
this
court
unequivocally
stated
in
broad
language
that
the
statutory
purpose
in
the
passage
of
the
sherman
act
was
to
curb
concentrations
of
private
economic
power.
the
court
stated
that
it
was
clear
through
pages
of
legislative
history
that
the
congress
was
aiming
at
private
individuals
and
business
corporations
and
of
course
at
that
time
there
were
the
great
sugar
trust,
the
oil
trust
and
the
railroads
running
rampant
and
that
was
the
basis
for
the
legislation.
the
court
further
said
that
there
was
not
a
hint
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
purpose
or
effect
to
apply
these
laws
to
state
government,
state
officials
or
agents
of
states.
34
years
have
gone
by
since
that
decision
and
that
clear
message,
and
congress
has
not
seen
fit
to
alter
the
decision
or
the
principles
that
underlie.
i
submit
that
cities
as
well
as
state
agents
and
state
officials
come
within
the
purview
of
that
decision,
for
cities
are
but
political
subdivisions
of
states
to
whom
the
state
delegates
power,
its
power
that
it
gets
from
the
people
as
a
state
for
the
more
convenient
and
effective
governance
of
the
people
at
a
level
closer
to
them.
in
addition,
cities
like
states
only
act
for
public
purposes,
not
for
private
gang.
mr.
jerome
a.
hochberg
i
would
say
that
that
would
not
be
subject
to
antitrust
attack.
however,
it
might
be
subject
to
other
remedies
under
the
constitution
and
the
commerce
power
and
congress
of
course
to
the
commerce
power
could
enact
the
legislation
to
perhaps
deal
with
it.
mr.
jerome
a.
hochberg
if
it
effected
intrastate
commerce,
i
believe
they
could
yes.
mr.
jerome
a.
hochberg
i
know
the
language
you
refer
to
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
i
think
just
the
opposite.
i
think
that
that
language
appears
in
a
list
of
three
kinds
of
conduct
in
which
the
court
in
parker
was
saying
the
state
could
not
immunize
persons
from
--
they
could
not
authorize
illegal
activity
by
individuals
and
corporations.
they
could
not
endorse
it
and
a
private
person
who
conspires
with
a
governmental
body
would
not
be
immune
from
antitrust
prosecution.
and
i
say
that
because
those
three
items
are
mentioned
in
a
discussion
in
the
opinion
dealing
with
the
defendants
who
are
private
members,
who
are
private
individuals,
the
growers
and
the
handlers
who
were
operating
the
raising
program
under
the
supervision
of
the
state
prorate
commission.
the
defendants
who
were
the
prorate
committee,
i
suppose
the
commission
were
private
persons
and
those
comments
by
the
court
were
made
in
the
context
of
what
was
being
described
that
the
private
parties
were
engaging
in
under
state
supervision.
so
i
think
it
is
just
the
opposite.
i
might
add
that
at
that
point
the
court
in
parker
also
seem
to
equate
a
state
with
a
city
in
that
statement.
now,
there
are
severe
consequences
it
seems
to
me
from
applying
laws
which
were
aimed
at
private
enterprise
to
governments.
mr.
jerome
a.
hochberg
well,
my
position
is
that
there
is
â€“
that
the
law
absolutely
does
not
apply
to
cities.
it
is
not
a
question
of
immunity,
but
the
congress
never
intended
to
apply
to.
mr.
jerome
a.
hochberg
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
jerome
a.
hochberg
no
exceptions
unless
congress
sees
fit
to
change
that.
applying
these
laws
would
have
--
mr.
jerome
a.
hochberg
there
is
a
remedy
for
those
private
parkings.
mr.
jerome
a.
hochberg
i
believe
it
does,
that
is
correct
your
honor
and
rather
then
use
the
antitrust
laws,
there
are
political
remedies
and
state
law
remedies,
if
the
public
feels
that
what
the
city
is
doing,
what
government
is
doing
at
their
behest
is
not
appropriate,
not
consistent
with
public
--
mr.
jerome
a.
hochberg
that
is
correct,
but
of
course
if
they
were
not
doing
it
pursuant
to
constitution
or
state
statute,
there
would
be
a
remedy
at
state
law.
mr.
jerome
a.
hochberg
that
is
right,
but
right
here
we
have
authorization
to
public
--
mr.
jerome
a.
hochberg
well,
i
am
not
sure
whether
he
would
be
deciding
that,
but
he
would
certainly
be
intruding
on
the
operation
of
municipal
government,
make
and
second
guessing
the
city
and
thereby
also
second
guessing
the
state
legislature
which
could
certainly
do
something
about
it.
mr.
jerome
a.
hochberg
well,
then
it
seems
to
me,
if
you
are
talking
about
antitrust
prosecution
it
would
not
matter
under
our
position.
for
the
trouble-damage
liability
to
be
hanging
over
the
heads
of
city
officials
and
city
government
would
have
the
effect
of
making
every
city
official
fearful
and
timid
in
conducting
the
business
of
the
city
and
precisely
what
we
need
right
now
in
city
government
and
in
any
local
government
is
decisiveness
and
not
inhibition
and
timidity.
indeed,
if
judgments
were
rendered
it
could
bankrupt
some
cities
and
most
important
of
all
whether
it
bankrupted
them
or
not,
it
would
have
to
be
paid,
the
judgment
would
have
to
be
paid
by
the
tax
paying
citizens
of
the
city,
not
from
risk
bearing
equity
owners
as
the
case
in
private
corporations.
mr.
jerome
a.
hochberg
somewhere
between
1700
and
2000
your
honor.
it
is
a
very
prevalent
mode
of
delivering
electric
service
through
municipal
owned
systems.
in
addition,
of
course
cities
own
many
other
things
in
operation
--
mr.
jerome
a.
hochberg
somewhere
close
to
2000,
between
1700
and
2000
is
my
understanding.
mr.
jerome
a.
hochberg
los
angeles
for
one,
san
antonio
i
believe,
part
of
cleveland,
many
small
towns,
however
too.
mr.
jerome
a.
hochberg
cities
engage
in
a
wide
range
of
activities
and
deliver
a
wider
array
of
services
in
this
day
and
age.
cities
do
not
just
deliver
electric
service.
they
operate
hospitals.
they
collect
garbage.
they
deliver
water.
they
provide
police
protection.
they
provide
schools.
they
operate
sports
authorities
and
public
parks
and
their
creation.
they
do
numerous
things
and
in
all
of
these
things,
they
operate
being
governments
in
a,
often
in
a
non-competitive
model.
they
do
not
structure
their
operations
and
their
services
along
competitive
models
as
private
enterprise
as
required
to
do
and
that
has
long
been
the
case.
by
it
is
nature,
government
acts
in
a
non-competitive
matter.
for
example,
they
issue
zoning
rules
and
variances
which
could
effect
the
competitive
ability
of
businesses
to
function
properly
in
their
location.
they
grant
franchisees
for
delivery
of
some
services
and
may
grant
more
then
one
or
they
may
choose
to
grant
one
and
exclude
all
other
competitors
or
they
may
choose
--
mr.
jerome
a.
hochberg
well,
i
do
not
believe
a
city
owns
or
franchises
that
ball
club.
mr.
jerome
a.
hochberg
well,
i
would
suppose
if
they
actually
franchise
it
like
they
franchise
a
garbage
collection
company
to
collect
garbage
in
the
city
then
my
principle
would
apply
equally.
mr.
jerome
a.
hochberg
well,
they
may
be
competing
with
sister
cities,
but
i
do
not
think
that
subject
to
antitrust
laws.
if
they
choose
to
deliver
the
services
themselves
instead
of
franchising
it,
they
may
exclude
all
competition
if
they
so
desire
or
they
may
leave
some
competition
in
the
city,
perhaps
mass
transit
competition
rather
then
just
the
exclusive
operation
by
the
governmental
authority
or
for
example
cities
can
combine
with
their
brother
cities
to
induce
lower
prices
from
suppliers
and
indeed
that
was
precisely
what
was
charged
in
new
mexico
v,
american
petrofina,
the
ninth
circuit
case
which
supports
my
position
completely
and
there
may
be
public
purposes
for
all
of
these
things
and
indeed
in
new
mexico
it
was.
all
of
these
approaches
differ
from
antitrust
concepts.
mr.
jerome
a.
hochberg
my
principle
is
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
it
if
it
is
a
wholly
governmental
body
as
opposed
to
a
private
party
or
a
private
party
given
some
self
regulatory
functions,
but
private
primarily
because
it
is
engaged
in
operations
for
a
pecuniary
benefit,
for
example,
the
virginia
state
bar.
those
lawyers
had
private
interest
at
stake
and
they
were
just
delegated
limited
functions
by
the
state
of
a
self-regulatory
nature.
so
i
would
draw
the
line
at
exclusively
governmental
bodies.
if
antitrust
laws
were
to
apply,
given
the
way
in
which
city
operates
in
franchising,
in
delivering
services
i
just
described,
there
could
be
a
flood
of
new
litigations
in
the
courts,
particularly
a
flood
of
anti
trouble-damage
litigation
by
every
disgruntled
franchisee
applicant
who
thought
he
was
the
victim
of
a
conspiracy
between
the
city
and
the
winning
franchise
owner.
mr.
jerome
a.
hochberg
that
is
correct
or
as
in
the
duke
case
in
the
third
circuit
which
went
against
us,
it
was
a
beer
company
who
wanted
to
sell
beer
in
three
river
stadium
and
apparently
did
not
get
the
franchise,
someone
else
did.
mr.
jerome
a.
hochberg
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
white.
if
as
i
say
every
disgruntled
franchise
applicant
is
going
to
be
a
potential
trouble-damage
plaintiff
and
indeed
every
private
business
that
covets
the
market,
that
the
city
now
occupies
in
delivering
services
would
also
be
a
potential
trouble-damage
plaintiff
and
it
would
not
matter
whether
their
claim
was
valid
or
not,
the
threat
of
the
litigation
or
the
actual
filing
and
then
having
to
fight
it
would
be
severe
and
all
done
by
the
lure
of
trouble-damages
i
would
suspect.
now,
even
the
respondent
here
and
the
various
amici,
in
particular
the
justice
department's
amici
have
recognized
it
seems
that
there
are
some
problems
when
you
are
talking
about
city
government
and
applying
laws
like
the
antitrust
laws
to
them
for
they
all
try
and
draw
lines
to
exclude
certain
conduct
from
the
reach
of
the
antitrust
laws
and
include
others.
for
example,
all
of
them
seem
to
want
to
draw
a
line
between
proprietary
and
governmental
functions,
a
line
that
has
been
discredited
in
the
past
and
rejected
by
this
court
in
numerous
cases,
most
recently
in
the
indian
towing
case
in
1950
i
believe
and
a
line
which
the
lower
court,
the
court
below
the
fifth
circuit
equally
rejected.
the
problem
there
is
well
described
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
his
opinion
in
the
indian
towing.
in
addition,
the
justice
department
proposes
a
regulatory
non-regulatory
line
and
that
line
seems
to
me
just
like
proprietary
and
governmental
(inaudible)
wash
because
to
give
you
an
example,
if
the
city
has
franchised
someone
else
to
deliver
a
service
and
instructed
it,
the
private
entity
to
conduct
itself
anti
competitively.
the
city
would
not
be
under
the
justice
department
test,
the
city
would
not
be
subject
to
prosecution
under
the
antitrust
laws,
but
if
the
citizens
of
the
city
decide
they
would
rather
deliver
the
service
themselves
because
they
feel
it
is
more
effective
that
way,
more
responsive
to
their
needs
and
did
the
same
thing
they
had
told
the
private
entity
to
do,
the
justice
department
would
want
to
sue
the
city
for
that
and
i
submit
that
makes
no
sense
in
the
long
run.
mr.
jerome
a.
hochberg
that
might
or
might
not
be.
it
would
depend
on
whether
it
came
within
the
test
in
cantor
or
in
goldfarb,
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
jerome
a.
hochberg
if
the
city
instruct
--
had
a
private
franchisee
--
mr.
jerome
a.
hochberg
transit.
mr.
jerome
a.
hochberg
and
instructed
the
transit
company,
the
bus
company
to
operate
in
a
manner
inconsistent
with
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
jerome
a.
hochberg
well,
whether
that
would
be
or
not,
perhaps
they
would
instruct
the
city,
the
bus
company
to
conduct
itself,
to
do
certain
things
that
would
be
considered
a
violation
of
section
2.
mr.
jerome
a.
hochberg
well,
if
they
instructed
the
bus
company
to
make
arrangements
with
a
another
bus
company
on
the
border
for
that
served
the
city,
metropolitan
area
to
come
up
with
the
same
price
for
bus
service,
so
that
citizens
in
the
adjoining
suburb
would
not
howl
at
the
higher
price
in
the
city
for
example.
mr.
jerome
a.
hochberg
if
the
city
--
mr.
jerome
a.
hochberg
no,
not
for
the
--
i
think
the
city
under
the
government's
test
would
not
be
subject
to
prosecution,
but
if
the
city
did
that,
the
government
rather
than
have
a
private
bus
system,
the
city
would
be
subject
to
antitrust
prosecution.
mr.
jerome
a.
hochberg
that
is
correct.
mr.
jerome
a.
hochberg
that
is
correct.
mr.
jerome
a.
hochberg
well,
one
of
the
charges,
there
are
other
charges
in
the
counter
claim,
that
is
just
one
of
them.
mr.
jerome
a.
hochberg
right,
that
is
right.
if
under
the
government's
test
the
city
told
the
private
entity
to
engage
in
that
type
the
government
would
not
be
subject
to
suit,
but
if
the
government
did
it
then
it
would
be
subject
to
suit.
mr.
jerome
a.
hochberg
right,
something
like
cantor.
in
cantor
the
public
service
commission
was
not
going
to
be
sued
or
was
not
sued
and
i
doubt
that
this
--
my
feeling
is
that
i
do
not
think
this
court
would
hold
that
public
service
commission
is
subject
to
the
antitrust
laws
for
endorsing
that
tie.
all
of
these
lines
that
the
city
and
the
respond
--
the
justice
department
and
the
respondent
in
the
various
amici
proposed
are
it
seems
to
me
totally
inconsistent
with
the
parker
language,
with
the
statutory
purpose
of
the
sherman
act
and
with
the
legislative
history
of
congress
in
enacting
that
act.
the
only
line
i
submit
that
is
consistent
with
that
legislative
history
and
statutory
purpose
is
when
wholly
governmental
bodies
are
excluded
from
the
antitrust
laws
and
private
parties
or
private
parties
with
self
regulatory
functions
granted
by
the
state
would
be
subject
to
those
antitrust
laws.
and
the
reason
i
say
that
is
that
there
is
not
a
hint
in
the
legislative
history
that
congress
intended
to
apply
the
antitrust
laws
to
some
levels
of
government
and
not
to
other
levels
of
government
or
to
some
conduct
of
government
and
not
to
other
conduct
of
government.
in
point
of
fact
congress
said,
we
are
passing
these
antitrust
laws
to
aim
them
and
curb
private
economic
power
and
there
was
not
a
hint
that
they
were
aiming
them
at
government
at
any
level.
mr.
jerome
a.
hochberg
i
think
that
would
--
that
is
not
the
issue
here
today
because
there
is
no
question
but
these
are
cities
and
they
are
totally
governmental.
in
that
situation
it
seems
to
me
this
court
would
have
or
any
federal
court
would
have
to
make
a
determination
whether
it
was
truly,
a
wholly
governmental
body
just
as
this
court
did
and
in
nlrb
v.
natural
gas
utility
district
where
it
had
to
determine
whether
the
district
was
a
political
sub-division
of
the
state
so
that
it
came
within
the
exemption
of
the
labor
laws
and
there
the
court
rejecting
of
course
local
law,
state
law
as
a
means
of
governing
whether
a
federal
statute
applies
decided
that,
that
district
was
indeed
a
political
sub-division
by
looking
through
various
factors
like
was
it
responsible
to
an
elected
official
or
to
the
legislature
ultimately
and
things
like
that.
again,
i
say
that
in
order
to
hold
city
subject
to
the
antitrust
laws
here
and
after
all
they
are
criminal
statutes
and
i
doubt
that,
it
seems
to
me
very
doubtful
that
the
congress
would
have
enacted
the
sherman
law
to
apply
the
city
governments
in
criminal
as
they
were,
without
some
indication
in
the
legislative
history
that
was
what
they
were
intending.
in
order
to
subject
cities
to
antitrust
laws,
i
think
this
court
would
have
to
repudiate
the
message
of
parker
and
impute
the
congress
and
intention
it
never
expressed
and
to
then
go
about
rationalizing
the
important
public
policy
of
local
choice
and
local
governance
with
the
antitrust
policy
and
throw
into
that
nix
in
addition
a
weighing
of
the
severe
consequences
that
might
occur
from
application
of
these
laws
and
put
them
altogether
and
try
and
divine
a
line
or
several
lines
with
caveats
and
sub
caveats
for
holding
antitrust
--
city
subject
to
antitrust
laws.
i
submit
that
--
mr.
jerome
a.
hochberg
well,
of
course,
we
certainly
hope
we
will
and
we
think
that
we
very
well
might,
but
that
is
not
really
why
we
are
here
today.[laughter]
mr.
jerome
a.
hochberg
a
number
of
cases
your
honor
had
just
come
up
through
the
courts,
since
goldfarb,
misapplying
goldfarb,
we
have
about
five
circuit
courts
going
against
this
now.
mr.
jerome
a.
hochberg
my
feeling
is
that
if
this
court
were
to
put
together
that
mix
of
rationalizing
the
various
policy
conflicts
that
exist
here
and
the
consequences
that
that
is
the
kind
of
a
procedure
which
court
requires
careful
investigation
and
review
and
analysis
most
appropriate
to
a
legislature
and
not
to
this
court.
thank
you,
i
would
like
reserve
my
--
mr.
jerome
a.
hochberg
that
language
is
perfectly
appropriate
mr.
justice
powell
when
a
private
entity
is
being
sued
as
that
was
the
case
in
goldfarb
and
in
cantor
because
the
antitrust
laws
were
clearly
aimed
at
private
enterprise
and
private
economic
power,
therefore,
a
careful
scrutiny
is
necessary
it
seems
to
me
to
make
sure
that
the
state
has
indeed
instructed
those
private
entities
to
do
what
they
are
doing
and
absent
that
state
instruction
it
seems
to
me
the
antitrust
laws
apply
across
the
board.
mr.
jerome
a.
hochberg
the
equivalent
of
the
state
in
terms
of
the
fact
that
they
are
a
political
sub-division
to
which
the
state
grants
its
powers
and
in
addition
because
there
is
no
legislative
history
that
the
congress
intended
to
treat
them
differently.
mr.
jerome
a.
hochberg
there
are
in
the
eleventh
amendment
they
are
treated
differently
and
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
they
have
treated
the
same
in
terms
of
state
action.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
in
each
situation,
constitutional
or
statutory,
they
have
to
look
at
the
statutory
purpose
or
the
constitutional
purpose
and
the
context
as
parker
said
and
when
you
examine
that
it
seems
to
me
that
the
statutory
purpose
here
was
aimed
at
private
economic
power
and
not
government
of
any
sort
and
i
will
treat
them
the
same
here.
mr.
jerome
a.
hochberg
to
curb
private
economic
power,
that
was
what
was
going
on
in
1890
when
the
sherman
law
was
passed.
mr.
jerome
a.
hochberg
i
think
they
probably
never
even
thought
of
it
justice
white,
but
because
they
were
not
even
thinking
about
going
after
governments,
they
were
concerned
with
private
entities
and
given
the
fact
that
they
were
so
definitely
concerned
with
private
economic
power
and
that
was
the
purpose
of
their
law,
with
absent
a
clear
intention
to
include
government,
it
seems
to
me
it
is
up
to
congress
to
remedy
that
after
the
parker
case
and
given
the
situation
in
1890.
mr.
jerome
a.
hochberg
that
is
correct.
mr.
jerome
a.
hochberg
i
believe
so
your
honor.
parishes
of
course
are
governmental
bodies,
wholly
governmental
bodies.
mr.
jerome
a.
hochberg
i
am
not
really
familiar
with
the
full
details
of
it,
but
it
might
be
or
might
not,
i
just
do
not
know.
mr.
jerome
a.
hochberg
i
believe
electric
utilities
got
started
in
many
ways
when
municipalities
provided
it
for
their
citizens
before
private
power
got
into
the
picture.
mr.
jerome
a.
hochberg
that
is
correct.
government
is
always
got
to
be
eventually
answerable
to
the
people
and
they
can
--
the
check
of
the
political
process
is
available
and
that
is
a
remedy
which
is
far
preferable
than
applying
antitrust
laws
aimed
at
private
parties
to
the
cities,
thank
your
honor.
