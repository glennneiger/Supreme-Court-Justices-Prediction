justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
is
a
rather
hypothetical
question,
is
not
it,
whether
it
is
legal
or
illegal
under
state
law
because
if
you
were
to
say
that
parker
against
brown
did
not
operate
in
that
situation,
what
you
have
is
a
federal
district
court
in
a
antitrust
suit,
deciding
a
matter
of
state
municipal
corporation
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
i
suppose
the
argument
would
be
that
the
state
legislature
did
not
give
the
city
the
authority
to
do
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
states
sets
up
a
power
district
which
is
a
municipal
corporation,
but
does
not
have
any
of
the
governing
power
that
a
city
ordinarily
has,
would
your
principle
exempt
it
too?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
as
bright
a
line
as
you
suggest
between
governmental
bodies
and
non-governmental
bodies?
let
me
go
back
to
my
example
of
a
power
district
that
is
authorized
to
be
formed
by
the
land
owners
within
a
particular
geographic
area
and
to
govern
itself
and
to
supply
power
itself
by
the
state
legislature
and
it
is
a
non-profit
type
of
thing.
now,
i
would
think
of
that
as
a
governmental
function
in
many
senses
and
your
answer
was
i
think
that,
that
would
probably
be
subject
to
the
antitrust
laws?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
back
in
the
1890
was
it
not
the
municipal
ownership
thought
of
as
one
of
the
safeguards
against
monopoly
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
parker
against
brown,
the
legislature
did
not
mandate
the
imposition
of
these
raisin
quarters,
the
quota
board
did,
did
it
not,
and
the
legislature
simply
authorized
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they
had
to
be
approved
by
the
growers,
did
they
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
thought
the
very
existence
of,
in
other
words,
if
a
majority
raisin
growers
voted
against
that
sort
of
a
thing,
there
would
not
be
any
prorating?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
carter,
let
me
read
you
this
sentence
out
of
parker
against
brown,
at
page
347
of
317
u.s.
and
it
says
if
the
proposed
program
is
approved
by
the
commission
is
consented
to
by
65%
in
number
of
producers
in
the
zone
owning
51%
of
the
acreage
devoted
to
production
of
the
regulated
crops,
the
director
is
required
to
declare
the
program
instituted.
now,
do
you
consider
that
to
be
a
state
mandated
program
or
requires
the
consent
of
private
individuals?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so
if
--
in
other
words,
authorizing
legislation
really
can
be
mandatory
in
your
view,
so
long
as
the
terms
of
the
authorization
are
complied?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
if
the
state
statute
said
in
any
city
in
louisiana
where
by
referendum
60%
of
the
voters
of
the
city
vote
in
favor
of
a
municipal
electric
company,
the
city
shall
establish
one,
that
would
meet
your
definition
of
mandate?
