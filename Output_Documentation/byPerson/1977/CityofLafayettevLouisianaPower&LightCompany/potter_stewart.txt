it
is
not
only
a
franchise
owner,
the
winning
vendor
of
any
commodity
such
as
parking
meters,
would
that
not
be
true?
justice

would
you
run
that
bias
again,
give
an
example
of
what
your
point
--

what
would
be
an
example

what
you
are
talking
about?
justice

stewart
alright.

i.e.
as
a
monopoly
within
the
city?
justice

stewart
or
if
the
city
says
to
outlying
suburbs,
if
you
do
not
ride
our
bus
as
you
cannot
get
city
water,
that
sort
of
candors
the
facts
of
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
arrangement?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
all
of
your
analysis
so
far
is
based
up
on
the
premise
that
the
city
here,
the
municipality
here
is
the
equivalent
of
the
bar
association
in
the
goldfarb
case
of
the
utility
in
the
michigan
case
and
of
the
marketing
association
of
the
california
(voice
overlap).
if
on
the
other
hand,
one
takes
the
view
of
your
brother
that
the
city
is
the
equivalent
of
the
state
itself,
then
your
analysis
collapses?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there
are
a
whole
bunch
of
law
cases
if
i
may
induce
your
phrase
the
other
way
to
all
the
cases
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
rights?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
is
the
important
part
of
your
argument,
you
have
to
begin
with
that
hypothesis?
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
in
other
words
mr.
carter,
if
the
defendant
in
this
case
had
been
the
state
of
louisiana
which
was
in
the
electric
power
business,
you
would
concede
that
they
would
not
be
within
the
coverage
and
that
if
the
state
would
not
be
within
the
coverage
at
all
of
the
antitrust
law?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
it
was
in
that
business,
that
is
a
sovereign
state
to
the
extent
the
states
are
sovereign
and
if
it
was
in
the
electric
business
then
you
would
concede
that
you
could
not
make
any
defendant
in
your
antitrust
law
suit?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
would
demand
that
the
legislature
go
further
than
that,
would
you
not,
under
my
brother
rehnquist's
example,
then
that
authorizes
the
city
to,
when
65%
electric
solo
to
go
under
the
electric
power
business.
you
would
require
as
i
understand
your
argument,
that
the
state
legislature
also
authorize
them
to
engage
in
conduct
which
except
for
this
authorization
would
violate
the
antitrust
laws?
justice
potter
stewart
would
you
not?
justice
potter
stewart
they
are
not
clearly
authorized
to
be
in
the
electric
business,
are
not
they,
by
the
state
legislature?
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
would
demand
something
more
than
that?
justice
potter
stewart
specific
authorization
to
violate
the
antitrust
laws,
to
engage
in
conduct
which
otherwise
would
violate
the
antitrust
laws?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
is
your
test,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
i
have
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
this
case
in
which
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
have
joined
and
in
most
of
which
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
also
joined.
the
fundamental
error
of
the
court
in
this
case
as
we
see
it
is
its
failure
to
recognize
the
difference
between
private
activities
authorized
or
regulated
by
government
on
the
one
hand
and
the
actions
of
government
itself
on
the
other.
the
legislative
history
of
the
sherman
antitrust
act
shows
that
it
was
not
aimed
at
acts
of
government
but
at
concentrations
of
private
economic
power
unresponsive
to
public
need.
in
the
words
of
one
senator,
great
trusts,
great
corporations
and
large
moneyed
institutions.
recognizing
this
congressional
intent,
the
court
more
than
35
years
ago
in
a
case
called
parker
against
brown
held
that
the
antitrust
laws
apply
to
private
activities
and
not
to
governmental
action.
there
can
be
no
doubt
on
which
side
of
the
line
the
cities
in
this
case
actions
fall.
municipal
corporations
are
instrumentalities
of
the
state.
city
governments
are
subject
to
direct
popular
control
through
their
own
electorates
and
through
the
state
legislature.
they
are
a
far
cry
from
the
private
accumulations
of
wealth
that
the
sherman
act
was
intended
to
regulate.
and
under
the
authority
of
parker
against
brown
the
petitioner
cities
in
this
case
clearly
are
not
subject
to
the
federal
antitrust
laws.
the
court's
decision
in
this
case
marks
an
extra
ordinary
intrusion
into
the
operation
of
state
and
local
government
in
this
country.
its
impact
can
hardly
be
over
stated.
as
a
practical
result
of
the
vagueness
and
uncertainties
in
today's
prevailing
opinions,
each
time
a
city
grants
an
exclusive
franchise,
each
time
it
choses
to
provide
a
service
itself
on
a
monopoly
basis
such
as
water
service
or
refuses
to
grant
a
zoning
variance
to
a
business
or
even
as
alleged
in
this
case
brings
litigation
on
behalf
of
its
citizens.
a
federal
court
may
hold
that
it
has
violated
the
antitrust
laws.
today's
decision
will
impose
truly
staggering
costs
on
the
thousands
of
municipal
governments
in
our
country.
cities
whose
grave
economic
plight
was
addressed
this
very
week
by
the
president
of
the
united
states.
in
this
case
a
rather
typical
antitrust
action,
the
respondent
claims
that
it
had
suffered
damages
of
$180
million
as
a
result
of
just
one
of
the
antitrust
violations
it
alleged.
multiplied
by
3
as
the
statute
absolutely
requires,
this
amounts
to
$540
million
on
this
one
claim
alone
to
be
recovered
from
cities
with
the
combined
population
of
about
75,000
people.
the
judgment
of
this
size
would
assure
bankruptcy
for
almost
any
city
in
this
country.
and
even
if
the
cities
ultimately
prevail
in
this
law
suit,
their
citizens
will
have
to
bear
the
rapidly
mounting
costs
of
antitrust
litigation
in
the
form
of
increased
taxes
or
decreased
services.
the
specter
of
a
city
closing
its
schools,
discharging
its
policemen
and
curtailing
its
fire
department
in
order
to
defend
a
federal
antitrust
suit
which
surely
dismay
the
congress
that
enacted
the
sherman
act.
for
the
reasons
set
out
in
detail
in
a
dissenting
opinion
i
have
filed
today,
i
respectfully
dissent.
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
also
filed
a
separate
dissenting
opinion
further
elaborating
his
view.
