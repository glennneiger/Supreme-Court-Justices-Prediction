justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
a
question
before
you
sit
down?
what
do
we
the
language
in
cantor
and
goldfarb
that
requires
a
command
or
a
direction
from
the
state?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
carter,
in
cantor
a
public
utility
commission
in
michigan
was
an
agency
of
estate,
was
it
not?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
it
was
argued
in
that
case
that
by
virtue
of
that
fact
that
was
state
action
that
argument
was
rejected
by
the
court?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
city
in
this
case
has
authority
to
make
rates
to
enter
contract
or
in
general
operated
utility
or
independently,
the
public
service
commission
of
the
state,
does
it
not?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
am
asking
about
the
cityâ€™s
authority
to
operate
an
electric
under
the
state
law?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
they
are
independent
of
the
state
utility
commission,
because
the
city
has
authority
to
operate
the
utility
that
is
substantially
consistent
with
the
authority
conveyed
to
the
public
service
commission
to
operate
or
to
supervise
the
operation
of
private
utilities.
i
am
trying
to
see
whether
there
is
analogy
between
the
power
conferred
on
the
public
service
commission
of
the
state,
than
that
is
conferred
on
the
city?
