mr.
andrew
p.
carter
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
andrew
carter
from
new
orleans,
louisiana
here
representing
louisiana
power
&
light
company,
often
referred
to
as
lp&l.
i
have
deeded
five
minutes
of
time
to
one
of
the
amicus
and
hope
i
will
not
regret
it
with
my
slow
talk.
i
will
try
my
best
to
make
it
through
own
time.
if
it
pleases
the
court,
the
city's
counsel
here
has
glossed
over
the
four
allegations
of
antitrust
conduct
and
i
believe
that
taking
up
one
of
those
examples
might
furnish
the
court
a
little
understanding
with
why
lp&l
is
bothered
here.
lp&l
is
primarily
a
rural
electric
utility
company,
engaged
in
furnishing
service
in
46
of
the
64
county
areas
which
we
call
parishes.
in
those
parish
areas,
there
are
some
cities
and
towns
and
in
some
of
those
cities
and
towns
they
have
electric,
gas
and
water
systems.
in
recent
years
they
have
been
going
into
the
outlying
areas
with
their
water
and
gas
and
electric
service
and
we
run
into
the
proposition
now
more
often
increasingly
where
the
cities
will
tell
customers
or
potential
customers
that
in
order
for
them
to
get
water
and
gas,
they
will
have
to
take
their
electricity.
this
is
done
sometimes
with
a
new
customer
just
moving
into
the
area,
sometimes
with
one
that
lp&l
is
already
serving
or
a
rural
electric
co-op,
like
our
friends
here
on
our
side
of
the
case.
so
this
is
a
practice
it
seems
to
us
to
be
a
classic
tie
and
arrangement
and
it
is
one
of
the
things
we
are
after
here
to
see
if
we
can
stop
it.
now,
i
have
read
the
city's
briefs
of
course
and
i
have
listened
the
counsel
today
and
it
seems
to
me
that
counsel
is
in
due
deference
to
an
adding
a
great
deal
to
what
he
is
advancing
to
call
it
a
principle,
what
he
is
saying
here
is
simply
a
superficial
preposition
that
if
the
courts
look
at
the
actor
involved
and
they
find
out
that
the
actor
is
a
state
agency
or
political
sub-division
then
the
inquiry
stops
right
there
and
you
are
through
right
at
that
point.
now,
that
makes
it
quite
obvious
why
counsel
did
not
talk
about
any
of
the
full
pertinent
cases
in
this
line
of
jurisprudence.
it
started
with
parker
because
every
last
one
of
them
shoot
down
that
preposition.
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
well,
he
mentioned
[laughter]
your
honor.
he
gave
them
his
blessing
as
he
passed,
but
he
did
not
analyze
them
and
of
course
since
they
are
on
my
side
i
want
to
analyze
them
and
--
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
[laughter]
well,
you
could
look
at
it
that
way.
i
think
mine
is
actually
an
analysis,
however,
because
what
i
want
to
do
is
go
into
each
one
with
the
basic
content
of
what
happened
in
that
case.
now,
the
first
one
i
am
sure
this
court
has
heard
so
much
about
it,
it
is
(inaudible)
and
parker
v.
brown,
but
in
that
case
you
will
recall
that
the
actors
there
were
your
state
officials
and
some
private
individuals
who
had
been
made
state
agents
for
the
purpose
of
this
raisin
proration
program.
and
the
activity
there
was
the
administration
of
that
raisin
proration
program
and
what
did
this
court
do?
this
court
looked
right
at
what
was
going
on
as
to
the
activity.
it
found
out
that
the
activity
had
been
mandated,
had
been
compelled
by
the
state
through
its
sovereign
exercise
of
the
legislature
and
so
it
held
that
there
was
a
state
exemption
and
i
think
one
sentence
is
the
key
to
the
holding
in
parker
v.
brown
and
it
reads
this
way.
the
state
in
adopting
and
enforcing
the
prorate
program
made
no
contract
or
agreement
and
ended
into
no
conspiracy
and
restrain
of
trade
or
to
establish
monopoly,
but
as
sovereign,
as
sovereign
imposed
the
restraint
as
an
act
of
government
which
the
sherman
act
did
not
undertake
to
prohibit.
so
what
did
they
do?
they
looked
at
the
activity
and
they
said
that
is
a
sovereign
act
mandated
activity.
now,
we
would
go
along
for
a
number
of
years
and
we
come
on
to
1975
in
goldfarb
and
in
goldfarb
what
did
we
have?
we
had
the
state
bar
and
a
county
bar
that
were
the
actors,
and
the
activity
was
a
minimum
fee
schedule
for
lawyers
and
what
did
this
court
do
there?
it
did
not
just
stop
with
the
actor.
the
state
bar
which
was
found
by
the
court
to
be
a
state
agency
by
law.
it
went
beyond
that
and
looked
at
the
activity
and
it
found
that
the
activity
was
not
state
compelled.
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
we
would
have
a
bates
case
in
that
situation,
probably.
i
do
not
know
all
of
the
underlying
circumstances
in
either
case,
but
it
would
very
likely
have
been
a
bates
case
and
you
would
have
had
a
sovereign
act
of
one
of
the
three
sovereign
branches
of
government
in
the
bates
case
of
supreme
court.
so
it
could
have
worked
that
way,
but
the
fact
is
that
your
honor,
as
i
recall
was
the
organ
of
the
court
and
wrote
the
very
words
that
we
rely
on
principle
here,
and
we
think
really
they
resolve
this
whole
matter
and
i
believe
that
the
court
stood
firmly
behind
those
words
and
i
would
just
take
the
liberty
of
one
sentence
sir,
actually
is
two
sentences.
“to
threshold
the
inquiry
in
determining
if
an
anti
competitive
activity,
a
state
action
of
the
type
the
sherman
act
was
not
meant
to
proscribe
is
whether
the
activity,
the
activity
is
required
by
the
state
acting
as
sovereig.
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
legislature
mandated
the
whole
program
and
it
in
fact
i
believe
went
into
a
pretty
good
detail
with
it,
naturally
they
could
not
go
under
detail
as
to
the
particular
price
on
a
given
day
or
anything
like
that,
but
they
--
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
had
to
be
approved
by
the
growers,
i
do
not
think
that
program
had
to
be
your
honor.
i
think
that
perhaps
prices
at
one
point
and
another
would
have
to
be
--
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
oh!
no,
i
do
not
believe.
[laughter]
you
must
be
right
your
honor,
but
that
is
not
my
recollection
of
it,
but
the
chief
justice
went
on
in
goldfarb
to
say
one
more
thing.
“here
we
need
not
inquire
further
in
to
the
state
action
question
because
it
cannot
fairly
be
said
that
the
state
of
virginia
through
its
supreme
court
rules
require
the
anti
competitive
activities
to
be
the
respondent,”
and
to
us
that
is
so
plain
and
so
clear
that
if
it
is
really
a
bright
line
rule.
and
we
come
to
cantor
which
happened
shortly
after
that
and
what
do
we
see
in
cantor?
we
see
what
i
believe
was
a
state
action,
but
not
a
state
action
case.
now,
what
do
i
mean
by
that?
i
mean
that
as
the
court
pointed
out,
you
did
not
have
a
state
agency
or
political
sub-division
that
was
a
party
so
to
that
extent
it
was
not
a
state
action
case.
on
the
other
hand,
the
court
reaffirmed
goldfarb
and
applied
the
rule
that
i
just
read
and
determined
that
the
activity
and
by
the
way
the
actors
there
if
you
recall,
the
actor
was
a
private
utility
company,
detroit
edison
and
the
activity
was
a
light
bulb
replacement
program.
this
court
looked
at
that
and
it
determined
that
was
an
activity
that
was
not
state
compelled,
and
therefore,
even
though
there
was
no
state
body
involved
as
authority,
it
applied
the
goldfarb,
parker
rule
and
said
detroit
edison
is
responsible
under
the
sherman
act.
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
well,
it
surely
would
your
honor,
but
so
would
a
whole
bunch
of
law
cases,
all
standing
for
the
proposition
that
the
city
is
not
be
equated
with
the
states.
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
well,
that
is
right
your
honor,
but
i
have
in
mind
the
commerce
clause
and
antitrust
cases
and
i
think
that
the
state
and
the
city
are
not
to
be
equated,
at
least
that
is
our
position.
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
indeed,
you
are
entirely
correct.
if
you
say
that
the
city
is
the
sovereign
then
you
do
not
have
to
get
any
further
than
that,
under
the
very
rules
of
that
i
have
been
talking.
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
if
it
was
in
that
business
as
a
result
of
exercise
of
its
sovereign
power
and
yes
--
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
i
would
as
an
antitrust
matter,
yes,
i
would
say
they
would
get
grabbed
on
the
u.s.
v.
california
under
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
would
not
restrict
it
to
just
legislative
mandate.
i
think
--
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
correct.
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
correct.
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
that
is
right.
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
your
honor
i
think
that
--
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
your
honor
as
i
read
parker,
goldfarb,
cantor
and
bates,
the
answer
is
that
if
that
parking
lot
were
not
the
result
of
some
mandate
of
the
sovereign
--
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
then
your
honor
they
would
have
to
abide
by
the
anti
trust
law
in
my
opinion.
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
yes
sir
because
i
think
that
the
state
directed
him
on
that
65%,
legislative
act.
i
think
what
you
just
read,
that
if
they
got
the
65%
under
the
legislation
he
was
directed
not
to
act.
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
oh!
i
think
authorizing
legislation
your
honor,
could
contain
a
mandate,
but
i
think
on
the
other
hand
you
can
have
authorizing
legislation
that
does
not
contain
a
mandate
and
i
think
that
you
have
to
look
at
what
the
legislative
act
did.
i
do
not
think
in
every
instance,
for
example
in
louisiana,
our
legislative
acts
permit
and
authorize
municipalities
to
engage
in
the
electric
business
and
they
can
run
their
own
systems
either
within
the
city
limits
or
without.
so
they
are
authorized,
but
the
question
here
and
i
think
it
will
be
the
question
on
remand
if
this
court
favors
us
is
going
to
be
whether
that
the
operation
of
the
electric
business
in
the
manner
we
have
charged
them
with
was
a
state
compelled
activity.
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
yes
it
would.
i
think
the
legislature
can
act
and
--
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
your
honor,
that
--
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
those
two
things
--
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
exactly,
so
--
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
oh!
indeed,
to
violate
the
antitrust
laws
that
means
they
are
exempt
--
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
absolutely,
i
do
not
think
they
should
just
go
around
making
tie
in
arrangements.
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
my
test
is
the
goldfarb
test
your
honor.
i
think
you
look
at
the
activity
and
then
you
determine
whether
the
state
as
sovereign
compelled
or
directed
that
activity.
that
is
not
my
test.
it
is
the
goldfarb
test
that
i
believe
is
sound
as
a
dollar.
it
follows
parker.
it
accommodates
the
tenth
amendment
argument
that
was
made
by
attorney
general
warren,
later
chief
justice.
it
does
all
that
is
necessary
to
have
a
fair
and
sound
rule
under
which
we
can
live
with
the
antitrust
statute.
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
the
public
service
commission
was
an
agent
of
the
state,
yes
sir.
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
detroit
edison
argued
that
your
honor
and
i
think
it
was
obvious
from
the
decision
of
the
court
that
the
court
considered
that
the
mere
filing
of
a
great
tariff
of
that
time
was
not
state
compelled
action
by
the
public
service
commission.
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
your
honor,
if
i
caught
your
question
correctly
you
are
asking
about
the
city’s
authority?
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
they
can
set
their
own
rates.
they
are
not
regulated
by
the
state
public
service
commission.
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
mr.
justice
powell,
in
the
louisiana
the
power
of
the
public
service
commission
to
regulate,
invest
on
utility
companies
and
co-opt
is
what
is
known
as
plainary.
our
power
about
commission
is
plainary,
so
without
trying
to
be
semantical
i
would
say
would
say
that
the
cities
would
have
certainly
no
more
power
than
that
and
possibly
less.
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
yes
that
is
right.
i
see
a
time
signal
that
causes
me
to
desist
from
going
further
with
the
bates
case.
i
think
the
court
has
already
absorbed
my
point
about
these
four
cases.
the
bates
case
just
stands
right
on
the
same
ground
with
the
others.
the
court
looked
at
the
act
of
being
the
state
bar
and
the
activity
restraining
law,
your
advertising
in
the
holding
was
found
to
be
mandated
by
the
sovereign,
the
supreme
court
of
arizona.
so
i
think
that
what
you
have
here
and
i
want
to
state
it
my
own
way
though
it
is
really
the
goldfarb
rule.
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
am
i
into
his
time?
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
i
think
i
can
do
something
about
a
minute
here
your
honor
that
i
would
like
to
do
very
much
because
city’s
counsel
has
pitched
the
whole
case
on
policy
and
i
want
to
throw
some
policy
considerations
out
to
the
court.
what
does
a
consumer
outside
the
city
of
plaquemine
do
when
he
could
get
his
electrics
the
cheaper
from
lp&l
or
a
co-op
then
he
could
from
the
city,
but
he
is
forced
to
take
it
from
the
city
because
that
is
only
way
he
can
get
water
and
gas.
so
--
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
that
does
not
seem
to
me
a
good
policy.
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
oh
yes!
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
yes
sir,
we
allege
a
tie
in
and
we
have
--
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
yes
sir,
the
affidavit
reflects
--
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
oh!
yeah,
it
is
in
the
counter
claim,
in
the
second
amended
counter
claim.
now,
for
another
policy
question,
what
happens
to
the
utility
facilities
that
the
power
company
has
placed
there
to
serve
a
customer,
cost
to
merge
and
long
terms
this
city
and
takes
the
customers.
your
honors
all
know
that
the
facilities
or
what
goes
in
to
the
rate
base
and
that
is
the
basic
proposition
for
setting
rates
until
–
to
make
this
brief,
you
know
that
the
rate
payers
are
customers
end
up
picking
up
useless
facilities
in
a
rate
base.
i
do
not
think
that
is
a
very
good
consideration
and
i
think
i
will
finalize
this
by
saying
that
when
you
look
at
the
policy
considerations
that
counsel
has
been
talking
about
today,
he
is
giving
a
bunch
of
dire
consequences
that
would
derive
from
violations
of
the
antitrust
act,
but
he
has
not
address
a
bit
of
what
would
be
the
dire
consequences
of
a
body
right
like
all
the
rest
of
us
have
to
do.
thank
you
your
honors.
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
i
have
nothing
further,
unless
the
court
has
a
question.
