well,
suppose
in
one
city
there
is
a
municipal
electric
company
supplying
the
power,
in
the
neighboring
city
there
is
a
city
franchise
who
is
a
private
company
and
it
is
the
only
company
they
franchise,
let
into
the
city,
though
it
is
not
effecting
the
monopoly
and
then
the
private
company
in
the
one
city
and
the
adjoining
city
conspired
together
to
exclude
competition.
they
are
doing
something
that
everybody
would
conceive
would
violate
the
antitrust
laws
and
they
get
sued
for.
one
of
them
you
would
say
would
not
be
exempt
and
the
other
one
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
then
you
say
that
here
it
is
just
as
all
the
city
as
the
state
had
done
it
because
the
city
is
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course
there
had
been
and
there
are
instances
in
the
federal
law
where
cities
were
treated
differently
than
the
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
suppose
congress'
purpose
was,
as
you
interpret
the
statute
what
do
you
suppose
congress'
purpose
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
--
what
do
you
suppose
the
intention
was
in
excluding,
implicitly
excluding
states
and
cities?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
just
say
it
was
an
example
of
ordinary
rule
of
construction,
you
just
do
not
apply
statutes
to
a
sovereign
unless
there
is
some
clear
indication
of
it,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
he
did
not
talk
about
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
analyzed
them
his
way
and
now
you
will
analyze
it
your
way?
