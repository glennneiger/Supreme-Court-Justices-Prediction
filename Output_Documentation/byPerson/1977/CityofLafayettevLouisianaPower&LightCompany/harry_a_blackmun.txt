let
me
change
the
question
a
little
bit.
suppose
a
city
conspired
with
a
private
entity,
is
not
there
a
language
parker
itself
that
suggests
that
a
city
is
then
liable
under
antitrust
laws?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
are
you
going;
is
your
submission
that
there
may
be,
there
is
absolute
antitrust
immunity
for
all
municipal
governments
in
respect
of
municipal
conduct
by
the
officials
in
the
municipality?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
alright,
in
any
event
that
the
parker
v.
brown
principle
applies
to
municipalities
as
it
would
to
state
governments,
is
that
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
no
exceptions
of
any
kind?
