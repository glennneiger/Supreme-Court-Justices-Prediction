mr.
s.
stephen
rosenfeld
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
wish
to
argue
three
points
on
behalf
of
the
commonwealth
this
afternoon.
first
and
primarily
as
it
turns
out
that
credit
unions
are
not
similar
to
the
appellant
associations
either
as
the
word
similar
was
intended
by
congress
in
12
u.s.c.
section
1464
(h)
or
under
the
current
facts
as
presented
in
the
record
in
this
case.
my
second
argument
will
be
that
the
massachusetts
tax
is
neutral
and
fair
and
nondiscriminatory
under
the
standards
of
12
u.s.c.
1464
(h)
and
finally
and
briefly
that
the
tax
does
not
intrude
upon
interstate
commerce.
for
the
purposes
of
the
whole
argument,
i
wish
to
emphasize
these
elements.
massachusetts
is
attempting
to
do
with
this
tax
is
to
have
the
appellant
associations,
domiciliary
corporations
contribute
their
fair
share
to
support
the
cost
of
government.
the
acts
of
congress
which
authorized
state
taxation
of
federal
institution
such
as
this
in
national
banks,
plainly
support
that
state
tax
policy.
additionally,
the
appellants
have
presented
no
independent
substantive
federal
policy
which
is
violated
on
supremacy
class
grounds
by
the
state
tax
in
question.
given
the
fact
that
congress
in
this
court
have
accorded
state
tax
policy
making
broad
discretion,
we
believe
that
the
appellant
associations
have
come
to
this
appeal
with
a
heavy
burden
of
persuasion.
i
am
going
to
turn
initially
to
the
tax
treatment
of
credit
unions
which
the
appellants
have
emphasized
in
their
oral
argument
today.
the
appellants
say
that
by
treating
credit
unions
differently,
massachusetts
has
violated
federal
law
because
in
their
view,
credit
unions
are
similar
to
federal
savings
and
loan
associations
as
the
word
similar
is
used
in
section
1464
(h).
this
is
not
he
case,
however.
credit
unions
are
not
included
in
state
tax,
that
is
true,
but
they
are
not
similar
either
as
a
matter
of
congressional
intent,
the
primary
standard
for
this
court
or
as
a
matter
of
current
actual
fact.
appellant
made
no
argument
about
congressional
intent
at
all
in
the
brief
they
presented
to
this
court
and
they
could
not.
the
legislative
history
to
the
home
owners
loan
act
and
it
was
the
home
owners'
loan
act
that
established
savings
and
loan
associations
and
also
enacted
1464
(h),
the
federal
statue
in
question,
that
federal
home
owners
loan
act
in
the
legislative
history
to
it,
presented
in
our
brief
makes
plain
that
the
73rd
congress
did
not
intend
credit
unions
to
come
within
the
definition
of
the
word
similar.
what
the
congress
had
in
mind
were
state
savings
and
loan
associations,
state
saving
banks
and
state
cooperative
banks.
it
is
interesting
to
know
that
the
very
same
congress,
which
enacted
the
home
owners
loan
act,
was
the
congress
that
enacted
the
federal
credit
union
act,
creating
federal
credit
unions
for
the
first
time.
the
federal
credit
union
act
was
enacted
one
year
later
in
1934.
the
congress
which
had
created
savings
and
loan
associations,
one
year
later
in
a
establishing
federal
credit
unions,
established
a
wholly
different,
wholly
separate
regulatory
structure
for
federal
credit
unions,
which
differ
significantly
from
the
federal
home
loan
bank
or
in
federal
savings
and
loan
association,
not
assigning
its
view
that
similarity
as
what
its
view
of
credit
unions.
finally,
in
terms
of
congressional
intent,
what
massachusetts
has
done,
tax
the
franchise
of
savings
and
loan
associations
and
while
not
taxing
the
franchise
of
credit
unions,
follows
almost
exactly
the
tax
policy
that
congress
itself
has
chosen
for
purposes
of
federal
income
tax.
congress
has
always
exempted
all
credit
unions,
state
and
federal,
from
the
federal
income-base
tax,
but
has
since
1951,
imposed
a
federal
corporate
income
tax
on
federal
savings
and
loan
associations,
including
appellants.
it
would
be
an
anomalous
to
say
that
the
state
is
precluded
from
the
adopting
the
same
kind
of
taxing
policy
in
terms
of
supporting
its
cost
that
congress
itself
has
chosen
in
imposing
the
federal
income
tax.
one
additional
point,
my
brother
suggested
that
federal
credit
unions
were
subjected
to
taxation
by
the
states.
in
fact,
i
believe
that
is
not
true.
the
citation
is
12
u.s.c.
section
1768
and
suggested,
the
language
is
that
federal
credit
unions,
their
property,
etc.'shall
be
exempt
from
all
taxation
now
or
here
after
imposed
by
the
united
states
or
by
any
state,
territorial,
a
local
taxing
authority.
it
appears
clear
to
us
that
the
congress
used
credit
unions,
federal
and
state
as
different
and
subject
to
different
forms
of
taxation
than
federal
savings
and
loan
associations.
turning
now
to
the
record
in
this
case
and
the
actual
facts
putting
aside
for
the
moment
congressional
intent,
we
believe
that
appellants
have
not
shown
similarity
in
fact.
in
addressing
similarity,
we
believe
it
is
a
comparison
between
classes
of
institutions
that
should
be
paramount
rather
than
picking
a
single
institution
from
one
class
and
seeing
whether
it
may
bear
some
similarity
to
a
single
institution
from
another
class.
in
looking
at
the
classes
of
institution
in
question,
the
facts
are
these.
credit
unions
are
very
small.
they
are
tightly
limited
in
their
membership
by
state
statute,
to
those
who
have
a
common
bond
in
either
employment,
affiliation
or
residence.
they
have
far
less
assets
than
the
appellants
and
they
are
mandate.
they
are
mandate
by
state
statute
is
to
emphasize
the
small
personal
loans
to
its
members.
mr.
s.
stephen
rosenfeld
it
could
mean
a
religious
affiliation,
club
affiliation,
and
social
affiliation.
mr.
s.
stephen
rosenfeld
no,
it
could
not.
as
i
said,
the
mandate
is
to
emphasize
small
personal
loans
and
it
is
noteworthy
that
this
is
an
activity
that
is
virtually
shunned
by
the
federal
associations.
on
the
other
side,
60%
of
the
credit
unions
have
no
real
estate
lending
activity
whatsoever.
as
far
as
the
remaining
40%
of
the
credit
unions
are
concerned,
appellants
have
not
shown
that
their
loans
are
at
all
competitive
with
the
federal
associations
much
larger
and
far
more
pervasive
real
estate
lending
activity
and
they
could
not
show
competition
because
the
credit
union
loans
are,
once
again,
limited
to
their
members.
credit
union
simply
cannot
go
out
on
a
general
market
and
seek
to
compete
with
other
institutions,
who
lack
the
kind
of
limits
that
credit
unions
have.
the
facts,
in
short,
are
against
the
arguments
that
appellant
are
making
and
they
do
not
support
excusing
appellants
all
together
from
state
tax
as
they
would
have
this
court
do.
at
bottom,
the
argument
here
that
the
appellants
present
is
one
on
tax
policy.
the
fact
is,
as
appellants
have
suggested
with
quoting
a
statement
from
president
carter,
it
is
a
policy
debate
that
is
now
going
on
between
the
legislative
and
executive
branches
and
massachusetts
believes
that
this
court
should
resist
an
attempt
to
draw
the
judiciary
into
the
debate.
i
would
like
to
set
an
out
turn
just
briefly
because
appellant
has
not
raised
this
issue
in
their
oral
argument
to
the
question
of
discrimination
between
federal
associations
on
the
one
hand
and
the
state's
treatment
of
those
state
entities
which
they
do
tax
under
section
1464
(h),
these
are
state
saving
banks
and
state
cooperative
banks.
the
question
is
whether
massachusetts
has
unfairly
favored
local
savings
institutions
somehow
at
the
expense
of
the
federal
associations.
the
vital
facts
are
these.
the
statute,
massachusetts
general
laws,
chapter
63
section
11,
is
neutral
on
its
face.
the
rate
of
the
tax
is
the
same
for
the
federal
and
state
institutions.
the
types
of
deductions
are
identical
and
the
appellants
offer
nothing
apart
from
the
face
of
the
statute
to
suggest
that
it
was
past
enacted
as
a
hostile
or
unfriendly
act
towards
the
federal
institution
and
these
are
the
words
that
this
court
has
used
in
assessing
the
question
of
discrimination.
as
far
as
the
appellant’s
factual
proof
goes,
they
have
made
no
showing
of
discrimination
or
disproportion
in
result
between
in
taxing
of
federal
state
and
institutions.
chiefly,
they
have
made
no
showing
that
their
actual
tax
burden
in
dollars
and
cents
is
any
heavier
proportionally
than
the
tax
burden
of
state
institutions
and
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
the
failure
to
show
a
difference
in
practical
impact
on
account
of
the
state
tax
is
fatal
to
their
case.
the
appellants,
while
they
do
not
present
evidence
of
actual
tax
impact
do
present
some
evidence
about
the
amount
of
their
deductions
under
the
state
tax
as
compared
with
their
total
assets.
they
present
ratios
comparing
the
amount
of
their
deductions
with
total
assets
and
compare
that
ratio
to
the
ratio
for
state
institutions.
that
ratio
has
no
proximate
relationship
to
actual
tax
burden
about
which
the
record
is
silent,
but
even
looking
at
the
ratios
which
are
presented,
there
is
no
clear
pattern
this
favoring
the
federal
institutions.
what
those
ratios
of
federal
and
state
institution
show
is
that
in
some
years,
the
state’s
institutions
did
enjoy
a
proportionally
or
comparatively
a
greater
deduction
than
the
federal
institutions,
but
in
other
years,
the
reverse
is
the
case.
in
three
of
the
years
presented
by
the
appellants
it
was
the
federal
institutions
which
enjoyed
a
greater
benefit
from
the
deduction,
using
the
ratio
evidence
that
they
present
and
rely
on.
finally,
on
this
question
of
discrimination,
this
court’s
decisions
under
section
1464
(h)
and
the
companion
provision
permitting
state
tax
on
national
banks
12
u.s.c.
548,
this
court’s
decisions
under
both
of
those
sections
leave
no
doubt
in
our
view
that
the
state
tax
is
valid.
those
decisions
require
fairness
and
even
handedness
from
the
states.
appellants
have
shied
away
from
these
principles
and
instead
their
argument
demands
rigid,
mathematical
equality
between
state
and
federal
institutions.
following
their
analysis,
no
deduction
which
had
a
disparate
result
or
even
the
potential
for
a
disparate
result,
no
matter
how
small
could
stand
under
the
principle
of
discrimination
which
they
advance.
in
our
view,
following
this
court’s
more
practical
standard
of
fairness,
the
appellants
claim
of
discrimination
falls
short.
finally,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
state
tax
intrudes
impermissibly
on
interstate
commerce
under
the
principles
lay
down
by
this
court
under
the
commerce
clause.
we
believe
that
on
this
issue,
appellants
do
not
law
or
evidence
on
their
side.
there
is
no
direct
evidence
whatsoever
of
the
extent
of
income
that
the
appellants
derive
from
interstate
commerce.
the
record
is
bare
on
how
many
borrowers,
real
estate
mortgage
borrowers,
live
out
of
state
and
there
is
no
evidence
on
how
many
these
loans
were
culminated
out
of
state,
however,
we
do
know
this.
we
do
know
that
everyone
of
appellants
have
all
their
offices
in
massachusetts,
and
therefore,
all
of
the
processing
of
the
loans,
all
the
monitoring
of
the
loans
and
all
the
receiving
of
the
loans,
goes
on
in
massachusetts.
well,
we
believe
the
record
thus
establishes
two
independent
bases,
under
the
commerce
clause
principles
for
the
tax
that
massachusetts
has
imposed.
the
first
relies
on
the
fact
that
massachusetts
is
the
state
of
domicile
for
the
appellant
associations
and
under
this
court’s
decision,
a
strong
presumption
exists
in
favor
of
a
state’s
right
to
demand
a
support
in
contribution
in
the
costs
of
government,
when
that
demand
is
made
by
the
home
state
of
the
corporation.
then
second,
quite
apart
from
domicile,
putting
domicile
aside,
the
record
shows
in
this
case
a
close
connection
between
the
taxing
state
massachusetts
and
the
activities
and
income
upon
which
the
massachusetts
tax
has
levied.
as
a
final
point
under
commerce
clause,
appellants
raise
the
specter
of
multiple
taxation,
but
they
simply
have
no
foundation
in
our
view
for
arguing
that
interstate
commerce
is
in
jeopardy
of
multiple
taxation
and
the
burden
that
would
flow
there
from.
there
is
no
overlapping
tax
that
exists
right
now
and
it
would
be
a
strange,
we
believe,
to
strike
down
this
current
justified
tax
on
the
basis
that
in
the
future,
some
state
with
a
lesser
claim
and
a
lesser
right
might
impose
some
tax
burden
or
might
stake
a
claim
to
a
tax
burden
on
some
portion
of
appellant’s
income.
in
our
view,
this
is
a
“thin
ice”
for
a
constitutional
challenge
to
a
state
tax.
we
believe,
therefore,
and
for
this
reason
and
other
reasons
are
presented,
the
reasons
the
commonwealth
has
presented
in
its
brief
that
the
state
tax
should
stand
and
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you
very
much.
