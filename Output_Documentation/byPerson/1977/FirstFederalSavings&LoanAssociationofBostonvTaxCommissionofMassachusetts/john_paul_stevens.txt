justice
john
paul
stevens
these
two
cases
will
be
of
interest
to
a
limited
segment
of
the
bar
that
practices
in
tax
law
and
more
narrowly
in
taxation
by
the
states
of
various
business
entities.
they
both
come
here
by
appeal
from
the
highest
court
of
a
state.
one
from
the
state
of
massachusetts
and
the
other
from
the
state
of
iowa.
at
least
one
of
these
cases
almost
certainly
would
not
have
been
heard
by
the
court.
if
the
court
had
discretion
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
hear
it.
they
are
both
here
under
our
mandatory
jurisdiction
where
the
court
must
decide
on
the
merits,
cases
in
which
a
state
court
has
upheld
a
state
statute
against
a
federal
constitutional
challenge.
there
are
examples,
at
least
one
of
them,
if
the
e
kind
of
cases
in
which
the
court
would
hope
that
congress
would
consider
removing
our
mandatory
jurisdiction.
the
first
federal
savings
and
loan
association
case
involves
the
validity
of
the
massachusetts
excise
tax
on
federal
savings
and
loan
association.
for
reasons
stated
in
the
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
massachusetts
supreme
court
upholding
the
validity
of
the
tax.
with
respect
to
part
of
the
analysis
and
the
opinion,
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
dissent.
