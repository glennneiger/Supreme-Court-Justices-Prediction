mr.
chester
m.
howe
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
start
with
the
uncontested
proposition,
that
federal
savings
and
loan
association
are
federal
instrumentalities.
as
such,
they
maybe
taxed
only
as
congress
authorizes.
the
congressional
authorization
appears
in
title
xii
u.s.c.
section
1464
(h).
mr.
chester
m.
howe
they
are
as
that
phrase
is
used
i
believe
in
the
national
banking.
mr.
chester
m.
howe
i
would
agree
with
that
your
honor.
the
congressional
authorization
appears
in
section
1464
(h)
and
it
provides
in
pertinent
part,
that
no
state
shall
impose
any
tax
on
federal
associations
or
their
franchise,
capital
reserves,
surplus
or
loans
or
income
greater
than
that
imposed
on
similar
local
mutual
or
cooperative
thrift
and
home
financing
institutions.
this
is
a
case
of
first
impression
which
should
determine
extent
to
which
congress
has
authorized
state
taxation
of
federal
associations.
in
1966,
massachusetts
elected
to
tax
federal
associations.
the
tax
as
imposed
was
measured
by
a
deposit
element
and
by
an
income
element.
the
statute
is
now
challenged
on
the
grounds
that
it
conflicts
with
1464
(h)
because
it
discriminates
against
federal
associations
and
also
because
it
violates
federal
constitutional
provisions.
i
propose
to
address
four
issues
presented
in
our
brief.
the
first
is
that
the
state
statute
exempts
entirely
all
massachusetts
credit
unions
from
the
tax.
the
exemption
is
discriminatory
if
state
credit
unions
are
similar
to
federal
associations
within
the
meaning
of
1464
(h).
the
largest
credit
unions
in
massachusetts
are
functionally
similar,
though
not
identical
in
both
powers
and
purposes
and
in
operations
to
federal
associations.
the
next
two
issues,
which
i
would
like
to
address,
is
whether
the
tax
is
a
franchise
tax
or
whether
the
commerce
clause
is
violated.
both
arise
from
one
statutory
defect
and
that
is,
that
the
statute
has
no
apportionment
provision.
as
a
result,
all
income
earned
outside
the
massachusetts
by
federal
associations,
is
taxed
by
commonwealth.
federal
associations
have
earned
during
years
that
we
have
statistics
about
a
third
of
their
income
from
states
other
than
massachusetts.
the
associations
are
a
part
of
a
national
housing
program
and
necessarily
do
a
large
out-of-state
business.
other
states
provide
a
variety
of
benefits
upon
federal
associations
to
their
recording
facilities
in
other
ways.
the
statute
makes
no
attempt
to
exclude
from
the
tax
base,
the
benefits
conferred
by
the
other
states.
by
definition
of
franchise
tax
measures
only,
the
value
of
the
benefits
conferred
by
the
taxing
state,
massachusetts
goes
beyond
that.
it
fails
to
limit
is
tax
based
in
any
way.
the
commerce
cause
parallels
to
franchise
tax
issue.
again,
no
apportionment
is
provided
where
income
earned
outside
the
commonwealth.
the
risk
here
is
one
of
double
taxation
on
the
federal
associations,
which
ought
to
be
prohibited
by
the
commerce
clause.
the
final
and
perhaps
most
important
issue
is
that
the
state
court
found
that
the
income
measure
of
the
tax
discriminates
against
federal
associations.
the
discrimination
is
caused
by
the
deduction
from
income
for
required
additions
to
surplus.
all
thrift
institutions
have
that
kind
of
requirement.
the
terminology
may
vary
from
institution
to
institution,
but
they
are
called
guarantee
fund
surplus
or
something
equivalent
to
that.
the
state
court
finding
discrimination
is
clearly
accurate,
it
should
be
dispositive
of
the
case.
however,
the
state
court
excused
the
discrimination
on
the
grounds
that
its
source
was
a
federal
regulatory
agency,
which
regulates
the
amount
of
the
reserve
requirements
for
federal
associations.
the
court
also
said
that
the
associations
have
failed
to
show
a
substantial
competitive
disadvantage,
neither
justification
is
valid.
this
case
arises
as
a
result
of
a
declaratory
judgment
by
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court.
the
record
consists
of
a
stipulated
facts
and
an
affidavit.
the
court
upheld
the
state’s
statute
against
all
challenges
presented.
it
was
the
second
time
that
the
state
statute
had
been
before
court.
in
1973,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit,
held
the
deposit
elements
of
the
tax
to
be
invalid
as
against
the
federal
associations
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
discriminatory
against
them
on
the
1464
(h).
the
basis
of
the
holding
was
that
in
general
the
mortgage
deduction
loans,
which
were
a
deduction
from
the
deposits
element,
were
applicable
solely
to
them
state
institutions.
out-of-state
loans
were
not
deductible
and
the
greatest
impact
of
that
limitation
was
against
the
federal
associations.
the
court,
the
court
of
appeals
that
is,
abstained
from
the
adjudicating
the
income
element
of
the
tax
on
the
grounds
of
comity,
indicating
that
there
was
an
adequate
remedy
in
the
state
court.
beginning
with
the
credit
union
issue,
the
state
court
found
that
credit
unions
are
in
fact,
mutual
thrift
and
home
financing
institutions.
however,
it
concluded
that
they
were
not
similar.
the
court
said
that
and
i
quote,
“the
test
for
similarity
is
not
what
each
type
of
institution
might
do,
but
rather
what
each
type
of
institution
does
not
in
fact.
the
associations
urge
the
standard
adopted
as
erroneous.
the
test
is
otherwise
in
other
cases,
other
tax
cases.
since
1935,
this
court’s
leading
decision
in
morrisey
v.
commissioner,
the
character
of
an
institution
has
been
determined
by
its
powers,
not
by
what
is
does
not
in
fact,
but
by
what
it
might
do.
the
basis
of
the
holding
is
an
institution
may
exercise
the
powers
granted
to
it
fully
at
any
time.
in
the
national
bank
taxing
cases,
involving
a
statute
related
1464
(h),
the
test
is
also
based
upon
powers.
for
example,
in
mercantile
bank
v.
new
york
case,
the
sole
emphasis
for
testing
similarity
between
new
york
trust
companies
and
national
banks
was
the
respective
powers.
mr.
chester
m.
howe
surely.
mr.
chester
m.
howe
as
i
read
the
1464
(h),
i
would
think
that,
that
would
be
the
answer,
your
honor.
mr.
chester
m.
howe
well,
if
i
can
try
to
answer
it
by
assuming
that
all
such
state
institutions
that
you
are
describing
earn
exactly
the
same
level
of
income
as
did
all
federal
associations,
excepting
for
the
2
or
3
that
were
exempt.
mr.
chester
m.
howe
the
rate
of
tax
in
the
aggregate
on
the
state
institutions
would
be
lesser,
perhaps
by
a
relatively
small
amount,
but
nevertheless
in
the
aggregate
lesser.
mr.
chester
m.
howe
that
is
correct.
interestingly,
the
state
court
failed
to
respond
to
these
precedents
and
the
state
tax
commission
has
equally
failed
to
address
them.
mr.
chester
m.
howe
the
years
in
question
that
would
be
the
answer,
your
honor,
but
on
that
score,
i
might
note
that
the
federal
associations
have
been
challenging
the
tax
from
the
outset
on
the
grounds
that
is
discriminatory.
there
it
is
not
something
that
comes
out
of
the
woodwork
late
in
the
day.
reply
to
those
statutory
differences
which
exist,
they
tend
to
be
trivial.
for
example,
a
credit
union
may
mortgage
up
to
90%
of
the
value
on
an
individual
home
as
compared
to
80%
by
an
s&l.
a
credit
union
may
invest
a
total
of
80%
of
all
its
assets
including
surplus
in
the
mortgage
field
as
compared
to
95%
for
federal
associations
of
deposits
only,
so
that
while
the
figures
are
15%
apart,
they
in
fact
are
closer.
the
maximum
loan
on
an
individual
residents
is
$50,000.00
for
a
credit
union,
whereas
it
is
$55,000.00
for
a
savings
and
loan
association.
mr.
chester
m.
howe
there
have
been
continuing
changes,
your
honor,
even
beginning
with
--
mr.
chester
m.
howe
i
believe
the
individual
limitation
for
a
federal
association
in
66
was
$40,000.00
per
home,
the
total
assets
--

chester

for
credit
unions,
the
appendix

rate

was
involved.
mr.
chester
m.
howe
thank
you.
mr.
chester
m.
howe
about
the
same.
mr.
chester
m.
howe
they
tended
to
escalate
presumably
reflecting
the
fact
that
everything
cost
more
(voice
overlap)
mr.
chester
m.
howe
if
you
are
asking
that
in
terms
of
the
percentages,
i
am
not
able
to
answer
the
question,
your
honor.
mr.
chester
m.
howe
if
i
may
answer
in
terms
of
comparability,
yes,
but
not
by
dollar
amounts.
mr.
chester
m.
howe
the
credit
union?
mr.
chester
m.
howe
i
am
not
sure
if
i
understand
the
term
liquidity.
mr.
chester
m.
howe
the
federal
associations,
your
honor,
95%
applies
to
federal
associations,
there
is,
however,
a
--
mr.
chester
m.
howe
generally
speaking
90
days.
as
far
as
the
s&ls
are
concerned,
however,
there
is
a
liquidity
requirement,
independent
from
and
which
is
not
in
anyway
incorporated
into
the
tax
statute.
the
state
court,
in
fact
did
note,
that
there
were
statutory
differences
and
commented
that
the
primary
area
was
in
the
details
of
the
loans
that
might
be
made
and
in
the
lending
powers.
beyond
that,
it
made
no
judgment.
for
the
larger
credit
unions,
the
percentage
of
mortgage
loans
may,
it
begins
to
approximate
the
percentage
of
the
loans
made
by
federal
associations.
there
were
99
credit
unions
with
over
$2
million
in
assets
each
in
1973.
the
$2
million
figure
is
important
because
the
powers
of
credit
unions
are
scaled
according
to
their
size.
at
the
$2
millions
level,
the
powers
that
i
have
been
addressing
are
with
credit
unions.
below
that,
the
loan
provisions
are
lesser.
of
the
99,
that
group
invested
$330
million
in
of
their
assets
in
mortgage
loans.
the
20
of
that
group
had
more
that
50%
and
10th
of
that
group
had
over
60%
of
their
assets
in
mortgage
loans.
the
major
difference
which
exists
between
the
two
kinds
entities
is
that
the
federal
associations
invest
almost
exclusively
in
mortgage
loans,
whereas
credit
unions
do
a
substantial
personal
loans
business.
they
invested
approximately
43%
of
their
assets
in
personal
loans.
nevertheless,
other
concededly
similar
institutions,
invest
substantial
portions
of
their
assets
in
non-real
estate
loans
and
by
way
of
example,
the
state
saving
banks
in
1972,
invested
over
35%
of
their
assets
in
corporate
securities,
a
power
which
the
federal
associations
do
not
have.
state
savings
banks
are
conceded
to
be
similar.
in
considering
this
question
of
similarity,
it
should
be
remembered
that
differences
must
exist
if
similarity
can
exist
between
entities.
similarities
denotes
difference.
without
differences,
there
would
be
identity.
if
we
do
not
have
differences,
we
would
either
have
only
credit
unions
or
only
federal
savings
and
loan
associations.
the
state
courts
which
have
considered
this
issue
in
the
past,
have
failed
to
recognize
that
simple
proposition.
they
have
universally
permitted,
very
minimal
differences
to
be
the
basis
for
the
exemption
of
credit
unions.
unlike
the
state
court,
the
tax
commission
emphasizes
differences
in
lending
powers
to
support
finding
of
dissimilarity.
to
properly
assess
this
contention,
it
should
be
remembered
that
the
congress
intended
to
protect
federal
associations
from
discriminatory
tax
treatment.
if
a
state
institution
has
powers
greater
than
those
of
the
federal
associations,
the
local
institution
has
an
advantage,
an
economic
advantage.
the
broader
lending
powers
conferred
upon
the
credit
unions
provides
them
with
that
kind
of
advantage.
adding
tax
exemption,
adds
to
their
competitive
advantage.
in
substance,
the
tax
commission
would
have
the
court
believe
that
the
credit
union
with
over
$65
million
in
assets,
with
larger
investment
powers,
needs
special
protection
by
way
of
tax
exemption,
stating
the
proposition
demonstrates
its
invalidity.
both
the
state
tax
commission
and
the
state
court
also
assert
that
the
preference
for
personal
loans
imposed
on
credit
unions,
limitation
was
significance.
in
fact,
it
really
adds
the
power
to
credit
unions
that
federal
associations
do
not
have
and
in
an
any
event,
it
is
not
restrictive.
any
credit
union,
which
invests
in
accordance
with
its
statutory
powers
that
is
for
example
up
to
80%
on
mortgage
loans,
cannot
validly
be
criticized.
the
commission
cites
no
case
or
regulatory
proceeding
to
show
that
the
statutory
precatory
language
regarding
personal
loans
has
ever
been
enforced.
that
fact
in
itself
indicates
that
there
is
no
validity
in
the
distinction.
mr.
chester
m.
howe
proof
of
the
negative
tends
be
somewhat
difficult,
your
honor,
i
have
not
found
one
and
that
maybe
simply
inadequacy,
but
absent
that
i
do
not
know
what
kind
of
proof
might
exist.
presumably
the
state
would
have
better
records,
at
least
in
the
regulatory
area,
than
would
be
available
to
us.
mr.
chester
m.
howe
if
they
have
had
that
data,
yes.
mr.
chester
m.
howe
it
would
be
a
simple
matter
to
make
it
available,
i
would
assume,
if
they
do
have.
i
do
not
know
if
there
any
records
kept,
we
find
not.
mr.
chester
m.
howe
there
are,
in
number
of
states;
federal
savings
and
loan
associations
in
massachusetts.
mr.
chester
m.
howe
in
the
commonwealth?
mr.
chester
m.
howe
in
1966,
the
commonwealth
chose
the
tax
federal
associations,
yes.
mr.
chester
m.
howe
there
is
no
exemption
for
credit
unions
either.
in
1934,
congress
specifically
authorized
states
to
tax
not
only
federal
credit
unions,
but
of
course,
their
own
institutions.
mr.
chester
m.
howe
it
is,
that
is
the
statute
that
i
initially
quoted
to.
the
congressional
authorization
is
contained
of
1464
(h).
mr.
chester
m.
howe
it
covers
all
similar
institutions.
it
specifically
covers
federal
savings
and
loans
association
and
also
more
institutions.
mr.
chester
m.
howe
the
state
does
not
tax
federal
credit
unions.
mr.
chester
m.
howe
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
it
makes
a
great
point
of
that
at
one
point
in
their
brief,
and
i
would
like
to
address
that.
one
other
point
on
the
standard
of
proof
that
the
state
court
imposed
on
us
with
respect
to
credit
unions.
they
required
proof
from
competition
for
the
same
kinds
of
investors
and
borrowers,
without
indicating
the
characters
of
proof
that
might
be
required.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
proof
obviously
must
be
made
on
the
basis
of
a
class,
based
upon
purposes
and
powers.
it
cannot
require
an
individual
sensory
survey
data
type
of
thing,
dealing
with
age,
sex,
religion,
wealth
or
whatever.
it
seems
to
me,
it
would
have
to
be
and
typically
has
been
in
the
national
banking
cases
on
the
basis
of
what
the
institution
is
designed
to
do.
in
that
regard,
both
entities
have
similarly
insured
deposits
levels
in
the
mortgage
lending
powers
we
have
already
discussed.
here
again,
if
the
investors
and
borrowers
are
different
for
the
two
classes
of
entities,
the
state
court
and
the
state
tax
commission
have
failed
to
show
what
those
differences
may
be.
mr.
chester
m.
howe
no,
i
do
not
say
that
precisely,
your
honor.
i
say
that
from
our
point
of
view,
the
standard
which
we
are
implying,
that
is
the
powers
and
purposes,
whether
deposits
level
generally
are
$33,000.00
in
the
one
instance
and
going
up
to
$66,000.00
for
joint
account
versus
a
$40,000.00
level
of
insured
deposits
for
federal
associations
are
so
conferrable
as
to
inclined
towards
the
same
type
of
depositor.
if
there
is
something
that
indicates
that
that
conclusion
is
incorrect,
the
state
has
not
brought
it
forward.
mr.
chester
m.
howe
the
point
i
make,
your
honor,
is
that
we
say
that
powers
and
purposes
indicate
that
the
classes
are
identical
because
of
the
similarity.
if
there
is
proof
that,
that
proposition
is
incorrect,
it
has
not
come
forth
and
that
burden
rests
on
the
state.
regarding
the
legislative
history,
the
state
commission
relied
heavily
on
the
fact
that
the
federal
taxing
policy
towards
federal
and
state
credit
unions,
supports
their
position.
we
believe
that
the
reliance
is
misplaced
and
the
reason
is
that
the
federal
legislation
began
in
1934.
at
that
time,
the
federal
credit
union
was
empowered
to
make
loans
with
a
maturity
of
not
over
2
years
and
the
maximum
loan
that
a
credit
union
could
issue
was
$200.00.
in
1951,
which
is
when
savings
and
loans
associations
became
taxable
under
title
xxvi,
the
internal
revenue
code,
the
maximum
maturity
for
loans
for
federal
credit
union
is
only
3
years.
the
differences
in
powers
and
purposes
of
the
federal
credit
unions
and
federal
savings
and
loan
associations
clearly
justified
the
federal
difference
in
treatment
in
taxation.
federal
credit
unions
continue
to
be
exempt
from
tax
for
federal
purposes.
states,
however,
have
been
empowered
to
tax
federal
credit
unions
from
the
outset.
if
taxed,
however,
they
had
to
be
taxed
at
a
rate
not
greater
than
that
imposed
on
local
banking
institutions.
the
fact
that
congress
linked,
federal
credit
unions
with
banking
institutions
establishes
that
the
federal
credit
unions
were
considered
to
be
light
banking
institutions
and
not
some
unique
kind
of
entity.
the
massachusetts
tax
policy,
on
the
other
hand,
began
in
1966,
32
years
after
federal
credit
unions
were
first
created.
in
doing
so,
it
was
obligated
in
1966
to
make
the
comparison
between
federal
associations
and
credit
unions
to
see
whether
at
that
time,
they
were
similar.
there
is
no
point
in
comparing
credit
unions
as
they
existed
in
1934
and
federal
associations
as
they
existed
in
1966.
moreover,
our
view
is
1464
ought
to
be
read
to
impose
a
continuing
obligation
on
states
to
maintain
a
nondiscriminatory
tax
on
federal
associations,
that
is
the
whole
function
of
1464
when
compared
to
all
similar
institutions.
if
a
local
entity
is
to
have
its
tax
exemption
continue,
the
exemption
must
be
re-examined
each
time,
there
is
a
substantive
change
in
the
powers
of
either,
federal
associations
or
the
local
entity.
it
is
not
something
that
can
be
once
looked
at
and
then
forgotten.
an
exemption
from
tax
not
discriminatory
in
its
origins,
may
become
so
over
time.

perhaps
the
most
important
aspect
of
the
statutory
history
is
what
president
carter
has
asked
the
congress
to
do.
the
president
has
said
in
his
message
to
the
congress
on
january
21
of
this
year
and
i
quote,
“credit
unions
are
tax
exempt,”
yet
their
powers
and
functions
are
defined
so
broadly
that
the
term
credit
union
can
include
financial
institutions
that
are
functionally
identical
to
a
savings
and
loan
association.
the
tax
exemption
provides
them
with
an
unfair
advantage
over
their
competitors.
that
is
precisely
what
we
have
been
saying
since
1966.
the
federal
statutory
and
legislative
history
rather
than
supporting
the
state
tax
commission,
clearly
establishes
credit
unions
to
be
similar
banking
institutions
nearly
identical
to
federal
savings
and
loans
associations.
there
is
no
justification
for
the
exemption
of
the
tax
of
the
credit
unions.
the
next
two
subjects
can
be
handled
together
and
briefly
i
hope,
and
they
arise
because
the
state
statute
provides
for
no
apportionment
for
income
earned
outside
the
commonwealth.
the
failure
to
apportion
is
fatal
in
our
view.
the
two
simple
propositions
are
presented
here
and
the
first
is
definitional.
the
state
court
labeled
the
tax
a
franchise
tax
and
of
course,
1464
(h)
permits
a
franchised
tax.
the
real
question
is,
is
it
a
franchise
tax
within
the
meaning
of
1464
(h)
and
the
answers
seems
to
me
is
a
clear
“no.
by
definition,
a
franchise
tax
must
measure
only
the
value
of
the
privileges
conferred
by
the
taxing
state.
here
in
massachusetts
taxes
the
entire
value
of
the
federal
franchise
without
regard
to
the
benefits
conferred
by
other
states
and
the
other
states
do
confer
substantial
benefits.
federal
associations
are
part
of
a
national
housing
program.
one
of
the
functions
they
serve
in
that
is
to
put
mortgage
loans
out
throughout
the
nation.
mr.
chester
m.
howe
the
principal
offices
of
all
of
the
federal
associations
are
in
massachusetts,
your
honor.
mr.
chester
m.
howe
the
failure
to
permit
other
states
to
tax
on
that
basis
for
the
benefits
they
confer,
massachusetts
is
taxing
all
of
them.
it
seems
to
me
violates
the
section
1464
(h)
by
imposing
effectively
a
double
tax,
although
there
is
no
such
present
double
tax.
