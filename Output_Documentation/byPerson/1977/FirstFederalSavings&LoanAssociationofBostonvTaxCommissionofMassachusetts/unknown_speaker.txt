mr.
howe,
can
i
interrupt
you
with
one
question?
unknown
speaker
supposing
you
had
a
thousand
state
savings
and
loan
institutions
and
credit
unions,
all
of
which
were
taxed
at
the
same
rate
as
the
federal
and
then
the
state
of
massachusetts
granted
an
exemption
to
say
2
or
3
institutions,
so
that
they
would
not
be
taxing
all
of
the
similar
institutions,
but
just
97%
of
them
say.
would
that
require
them
to
repeal
the
tax
on
the
federal
or
is
there
a
requirement
that
all
similar
institutions
be
taxed?
unknown
speaker
just
says
that
the
rate
cannot
be
higher
than
that
imposed
on
other
similar
local
units
and
there
is
a
tax
on
the
state
savings
and
loans
and
the
rate
on
the
federal
is
the
same,
what
is
if
it
says
that
every
similar
state
agency
must
be
subjected
to
the
tax?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
i
see,
so
you
say
that
are
all
of
those
that
are
similar?
unknown
speaker
so,
if
you
prevail
on
this
the
state
could
not
collect
the
tax
from
the
federal
institutions
at
all
for
the
years
in
question?
unknown
speaker
instantly,
release
similarities,
i
gather
is
what
you
argued.
when
section
11
was
enacted,
that
was
in
1966,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
what
was
in
66?
unknown
speaker
the
credit
unions
and
what
was
it
for
the
credit
union?
unknown
speaker
that
is
is
alright,
do
not
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
it
was
about
the
same?
unknown
speaker
so,
any
changes
since
66,
have
paralleled
to
one
another,
have
they
as
to
the
--
unknown
speaker
to
the
same
degree
for
each?
unknown
speaker
the
amounts?
unknown
speaker
mr.
howe,
i
am
going
to
reveal
my
stupidity,
but
are
there
federally-chartered
credit
unions
as
well
as
state-chartered?
unknown
speaker
are
the
federally-chartered
credit
union
subject
to
tax?
unknown
speaker
yes
in
the
commonwealth.
unknown
speaker
was
not
there
sovereign
immunity
problem
in
taxing?
why
did
they
need
a
special
exemption
for
savings
and
loans
and
not
for
credit
unions?
unknown
speaker
i
see,
so
federally-chartered
credit
union
in
massachusetts
could
be
taxed
by
the
state,
by
the
state
of
massachusetts?
unknown
speaker
it
covers
both
credit
unions
and
savings
and
loan.
unknown
speaker
so
they
are
putting
all
together.
the
state
of
massachusetts
taxes
state
and
federal
savings
and
loans
and
federal
credit
unions,
but
not
state
credit
union.
unknown
speaker
it
does
not
tax
federal
credit
union?
unknown
speaker
that
is
to
say
if
in
1966,
there
may
have
been
a
basis
for
concluding
that
the
state
credit
unions
were
dissembled,
and
therefore,
it
did
not
have
to
be
taxed
although
federal
institutions
could,
that
might
change
since
66
and
the
two
become
similar,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
it
gets
back
to
what
asked
i
had
asked
you
earlier.
how
about
66,
what
was
the
situation
in
66?
unknown
speaker
well
did
you
regard
them
as
similar?
unknown
speaker
and
were
they
taxed
in
66?
unknown
speaker
but
they
did
not
tax?
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
i
was
saying.
unknown
speaker
and
you
say,
they
should
have
taxed
them
then
and
continue
to
and
not
having
done
so
they
cannot
tax
you?
