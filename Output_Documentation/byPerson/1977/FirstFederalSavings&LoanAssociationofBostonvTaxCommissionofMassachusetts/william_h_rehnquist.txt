justice
william
h.
rehnquist
whose
burden
is
it
to
show
whether
that
language
in
concededly
existing
statue
of
regulation
has
been
enforced
on
the
person
who
is
seeking
to
sustain
the
validity
of
the
tax
or
on
the
person
who
seeks
to
invalidate
the
tax?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
is
your
view
that,
that
burden
should
be
on
the
state
and
not
on
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
we
know
whether
they
have
had
data
or
nothing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
say
again,
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
them
rather
than
on
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
saying
that
they
have
made
an
argument
and
you
disagree
with
their
argument?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
client
is
domiciled
in
massachusetts,
is
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
does
affiliation
mean
in
the
states
that
(voice
overlap).
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
could
just
mean
affiliation
with
the
credit
union?
