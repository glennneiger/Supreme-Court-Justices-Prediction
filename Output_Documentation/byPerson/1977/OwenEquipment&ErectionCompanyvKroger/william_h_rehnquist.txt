justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
excused
from
the
proceedings,
you
mean
the
original
defendant
move
for
summary
judgment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
counsel,
i
gather
from
the
majority
in
dissenting
views
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
there
may
be
some
difference
on
this
point
of
view.
what
position
do
you
take?
do
you
take
the
view
that
it
is
your
obligation
to
call
to
the
attention
of
the
district
court
by
a
motion
at
some
stage,
its
lack
of
jurisdiction
or
that
that
is
something
that
may
be
raised
by
any
party
or
by
the
court
on
its
own
motion
anytime
as
long
as
there
has
been
no
act
of
concealment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
unless
they
are
admitted
in
the
pleadings.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly,
the
customary
interpretation
was
a
civil
procedure
does
not
ordinarily
take
into
contemplation
intention
with
respect
to
the
allegations
of
the
pleading,
does
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
thing
speaks
for
itself.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
counsel,
if
on
this
day
before
the
case
was
to
go
to
the
jury,
the
pleadings
have
been
called
to
judge
denny’s
attention
and
he
had
construed
the
petitioners
answer
to
the
allegation
as
to
diversity
as
a
denial
of
your
allegations
as
diversity
he
said
we
simply
do
not
have
diversity
here.
would
you
say
that
if
he
had
construed
it
in
that
way,
he
should
have
been
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
8th
circuit,
he
said,
“i
am
going
to
dismiss
this
case
right
now
for
want
of
jurisdiction.”
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
you
really
do
not
regard
federal
courts
as
courts
of
limited
jurisdiction.
you
treat
this
very
much
as
the
court
of
original
jurisdiction
in
iowa
and
nebraska
as
general
jurisdiction
unless
someone
comes
and
moves
to
dismiss?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
rule
are
you
referring
to?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
if
owen
had
just
chosen
in
its
answer
to
flatly
deny
that
it
was
a
resident
and
citizen
as
you
alleged
it
to
be
so
that
there
was
no
way
of
interpreting
its
pleading
other
than
a
denial
of
diversity
jurisdiction,
but
had
done
nothing
more,
would
you
still
say
that
it
was
estop?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
is
it
not
jurisdiction
something
that
can
be
raised
at
any
time?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
have
got
two
cases
from
this
court.
finn
v.
american
fire
and
casualty
company
and
a
general
electric
case
that
i
wrote
about
six
or
seven
years
ago
that
say
quite
apart
from
inequities
or
unfairness
question
of
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court
can
be
raised
at
any
time?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
here
is
your
opportunity
to
do
so.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
was
about
aldinger.
i
was
talking
about
the
general
electric
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
judge
sobeloff’s
opinion
in
kenrose
was
absolute
and
prohibitory
only
in
the
sense
that
it
said,
if
you
are
going
to
go
into
the
federal
court
which
is
the
court
of
limited
jurisdiction,
you
are
going
to
have
to
bear
the
burdens
as
well
as
the
benefits,
you
have
available
to
you,
your
state
court
of
general
jurisdiction
which
you
would
not
suffer
those
from
and
that
is
your
alternative?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
judge
sobeloff
not
say
in
kenrose
that
the
plaintiffs
could
have
gone
into
the
state
court
without
having
all
of
the
problems
that
were
now
raised
because
of
pendant
and
ancillary
jurisdiction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
state
court
remedy
was
available
the
day
you
filed
in
federal
court,
was
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
still
have
not
said,
could
you
have
filed
as
of
the
date
you
filed
your
original
lawsuit
in
state
court
against
owen
and
could
you
have
filled
as
of
the
date
you
filed
your
amended
complaint
against
owen?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
certainly,
you
could
have
filed
as
of
the
date
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
will
you
tell
us
where
you
are
reading
from?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
turning
to
page
28
of
the
appendix
on
paragraph
i
of
your
answer,
you
say
you
admit
that
owen
equipment
and
erection
company
is
a
corporation
organized
and
existing
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
nebraska.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
not
sufficient
under
these
federal
statutes
and
if
the
plaintiff
is
a
resident
of
iowa,
the
defendant
corporation
is
incorporated
in
iowa,
but
has
its
principal
place
of
business,
incorporated
in
nebraska,
but
has
its
principal
place
of
business
in
iowa?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
there
is
no
diversity.
