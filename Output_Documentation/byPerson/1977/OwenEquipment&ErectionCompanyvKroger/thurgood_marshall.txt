justice

that
is
a
new
lawsuit
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
realigned
them
because
you
lost
the
regular
party?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
you
admitted
everything
except
the
jurisdiction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
do
not
feel
that
you
as
a
lawyer
had
any
responsibility
to
tell
the
court
that
it
did
not
have
jurisdiction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
did
know
that
they
had
their
main
office
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
you
know
where
the
main
office
of
your
client
was?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
did
your
check
come
from?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
will
give
you
one
on
the
second
circuit.
we
are
doing
the
argument
that
is
fair
enough
that
they
only
had
$10,000.00
involved
and
it
was
thrown
out
because
the
statute
says
in
excess
of
$10,000.00?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
jurisdiction,
the
word
we
are
talking
about.
the
same
thing
jurisdiction,
so
jurisdiction
can
be
raised
in
any
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
agree
with
this
you
cannot
raise
jurisdiction
(inaudible).
justice
thurgood
marshall
let
us
take
this
case
here.
you
were
wrong
in
your
allegations
were
you
not,
in
saying
that
this
was
a
resident
of
one
state
where
he
really
was
a
resident
of
another
state?
you
were
wrong.
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
that
shows
an
affidavit.
is
that
the
same
thing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
do
not
see
anything
wrong
when
you
take
the
certificate
of
the
nebraska
government
which
shows
the
office
as
being
in
nebraska.
i
do
not
see
why
you
have
to
go
farther?
you
rely
on
the
state
document.
