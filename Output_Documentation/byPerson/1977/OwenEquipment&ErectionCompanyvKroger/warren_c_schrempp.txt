mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
our
position
in
this
matter
is
generally
simple
we
hope
and
that
is
that
we
simply
contend
that
the
united
states
district
court
had
the
power
to
retain
and
dispose
of
this
case
in
its
waning
moments
when
the
for
the
first
time
the
jurisdiction
was
attacked
and
that
it
was
within
the
discretion
of
the
district
court
to
retain
and
dispose
of
this
cause
under
its
ancillary
powers
and
that
under
the
unique
facts
of
this
case
as
maybe
readily
apparent
from
a
reading
of
the
time
table
of
events
in
this
case,
therefore,
the
united
states
district
court
to
have
failed
to
retain
and
dispose
of
this
litigation
which
had
been
pending
for
four
long
years
in
federal
court
would
have
indeed
been
an
abuse
of
his
discretion
in
rejecting
a
final
disposition
of
this
claim
one
day
before
it
was
to
go
to
the
jury.
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
the
iowa
savings
statute
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice
is
a
statute
that
from
my
knowledge
of
iowa
law
is
as
vague
and
nebulous
and
its
boundaries
are
as
murky
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
mentioned
about
the
boundaries
of
iowa
and
nebraska
on
the
west
side
of
missouri
river.
i
do
not
know.
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
yes,
your
honor
under
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
this
particular
case
after
the
four
years
of
litigation
i
think
it
would
have
been
on
abuse
of
his
discretion
at
that
point
even.
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
well,
your
honor;
of
course
federal
courts
are
courts
of
limited
jurisdiction.
i
think
that
limited
jurisdiction
though
derives
in
the
power
of
the
united
states
district
court
or
united
states
district
judge
if
you
will
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
provides
in
general
that
this
court
may
in
appropriate
circumstances
retain
a
jurisdiction
of
a
case.
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
rule
14.
rule
14
does
not
in
an
of
itself
and
i
would
rather
quote
words
from
gary
v.
wire
in
second
circuit
on
that.
rule
14
does
not
extend
jurisdiction.
it
nearly
sanctions
an
impleading
procedure
which
rests
upon
the
broad
conception
of
a
claim
as
comprising
a
set
of
facts
giving
rise
to
rights
flowing
both
to
and
from
a
defendant.
for
solution
of
the
incidental
jurisdictional
problems
which
often
attend
utilization
of
the
procedure,
the
concept
of
ancillary
jurisdiction
which
long
antedated
the
federal
rules
may
often
be
gone
upon.
i
do
espouse
that
view
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
comment
on
what
this
case
does
not
concern
from
the
standpoint
of
equity
and
fairness.
this
case
does
not
concern
a
forum
shopping
situation.
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
was
not
in
state
plaintiff
seeking
to
gain
some
advantage
over
an
out-of-state
plaintiff.
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
was
an
out-of-state
plaintiff
coming
to
the
court
of
nebraska.
there
was
no
forum
shopping,
which
i
think
and
with
respect
to
the
discretion
exercise
of
the
court
is
worthy
of
comment.
secondly,
there
was
no
advantage
gained
and
secondly
and
i
am
drawing
particular
attention
to
aldinger
your
honor,
we
did
not
implead
a
new
party.
we
started
out
as
has
been
slightly
delineated
by
the
counsel
with
a
suit
against
the
omaha
public
power
district.
the
omaha
public
power
district
is
a
political
subdivision.
this
was
the
first
delay
in
the
case
because
there
is
a
six
months
waiting
period
and
without
going
out
of
the
ramifications
of
that,
we
started
out
against
the
omaha
public
power
district
with
a
complete
diversity
of
course.
ultimately,
then
omaha
public
power
district
impleaded
owen
erection
and
equipment
company,
the
defendant
in
this
case.
this
was
not
a
choice
of
ours.
we
did
not
implead
a
new
party.
we
did
not
make
codefendants
of
two
parties.
we
took
the
parties
as
we
found
them
a
party
that
had
been
impleaded
by
the
original
defendant,
the
third
party
plaintiff,
that
there
is
no
suggestion
of
anything
other
than
that
in
this
case
and
i
might
say
further
that
with
respect
to
one
of
the
traditional
lines
of
reasoning
and
that
is
that
this
gives
rise
to
collusion.
i
join
b
so
i
can
really
get
at
c.
there
is
not
i
submit
to
this
court
one
hint
or
suggestion
of
any
such
collusion.
to
the
contrary
our
battle
against
the
omaha
public
power
district
predured
and
went
all
the
way
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals.
by
the
time
it
had
come
out
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals,
the
statute
of
limitations
of
course
had
run
in
iowa.
at
that
time
the
statute
of
limitations
ran
iowa
which
was
january
of
1974,
all
three
parties
were
very
properly,
i
think
everyone
will
agree
in
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court,
kroger,
oppd,
owen.
there
would
be
no
reason
for
any
filing
or
dismissal
without
prejudice.
certainly,
we
could
not
dismiss
without
prejudice.
there
are
all
three
parties
in
there
and
they
were
all
three
parties
very
(inaudible)
in
federal
court.
for
18
months
after
the
statute
of
limitations
ran,
until
there
was
a
final
affirmance
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
of
the
summary
judgment
which
the
omaha
public
power
district
had
gained
against
kroger.
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
well,
certainly
for
the
18
months
after
the
statue
ran
there
would
have
been
no
impropriety
about
going
ahead
because
the
omaha
public
power
district
certainly
would
not
have
let
owen
out.
they
joined
them
in
the
first
place.
they
were
after
them
and
then
we
were
both
after
them.
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
your
honor
i
believe
a
jurisdictional
question
if
you
say
it
can
be
raised
at
any
time
my
answer
is
that,
no,
it
cannot
be
raised
at
any
time.
it
can
be
raised
normally
at
any
time
unless
the
inequities,
the
unfairness,
the
absolute
lack
of
justice
of
raising
it
as
was
done
in
this
case.
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
your
honor
i
was
going
to
discuss,
i
felt
and
this
is
very
difficult
to
stand
before
a
court
who
wrote
the
opinion
and
stand
before
the
author
of
that
opinion
and
tell
him
what
i
think
he
meant.
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
i
felt
that
you
are
very
discerning
and
wonderfully
narrowly
limited
decision
in
aldinger
would
be
an
indication
to
attorneys
that
this
is
not
an
absolutely
inflexible
rule.
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
yes,
that
would
be
on
the
amount
of
jurisdiction
your
honor.
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
i
would
like
to
compare
this
to
the
justice
at
this
situation
was.
let
us
assume,
if
i
may
--
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
as
matter
of
truth
and
fact
mr.
justice
marshall,
we
were
not,
but
that
was
raised
and
encountered
to
an
affidavit.
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
yes.
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
well
of
course
your
honor?
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
yes
your
honor.
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
not
completely.
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
i
feel
of
course
there
is
a
parallel
between
ancillary
and
pendant
jurisdiction
and
i
like
to
think
of
this
with
respect
to
with
your
question
mr.
chief
justice
and
your
question
mr.
justice
marshall
with
respect
to
what
would
have
happened
had
this
issue
never
been
raised.
what
would
have
happened
let
us
say
had
we
not
had
summary
judgment
granted
against
us
by
the
trial
court
and
ultimately
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals?
what
would
have
happened
to
had
the
trial
commenced
with
owen,
oppd
and
kroger
all
properly
before
the
court?
the
case
goes
to
the
jury.
the
case
goes
to
the
jury
now
against
all
three.
no
impropriety.
the
jury
then
returns
a
verdict
letting
oppd
out
and
a
verdict
solely
against
owen.
what
happens
now
if
this
be
a
rule
of
justice?
is
owen
then
out
after
the
jury
has
rendered
the
verdict
having
left
oppd
out.
i
think
it
is
a
parallel
situation
and
it
points
up
the
injustice
of
a
flexible
rule.
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
yes,
mr.
justice
stevens.
in
my
hypothetical
situation
here,
the
jury
is
submitted
the
case
with
respect
to
our
claim
against
oppd.
now,
that
does
not
arise
out
of
the
same
elements
of
negligence.
our
claim
against
oppd
was
based
on
the
fact
that
we
claimed
that
they
had
strung
their
high
tension
wires.
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
they
came
out
in
a
summary
judgment
so
that
that
may
be
clear
instead
we
sold
that
whole
system
to
paxton-vierling
company.
we
sold
the
whole
system
to
them.
we
felt
that
there
was
enough
control
left
and
we
felt
that
stringing
their
high
tension
wires,
they
are
insulated
by
air
and
space
which
means
that
they
are
bare
wires.
we
felt
that
we
had
a
case
against
them
and
then
during
the
discovery
we
develop
the
case
also
against
owen
equipment
company
on
the
grounds
that
their
cranes
were
improperly
--
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
yes
based
on
--
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
not
on
the
circumstances
we
feel,
no
your
honor.
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
do
you
mean
my
hypothetical
case
here?
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
alright.
the
jury
could
have
found
that
the
omaha
public
power
district
was
not
negligent
in
the
construction
and
maintenance
of
the
wires
that
the
jury
could
have
found
that
the
owen
erection
and
equipment
company
was
negligent
in
the
operation
of
scrutiny.
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
omaha
public
power
district
might
have
failed
on
its
third
party
complaint,
but
i
feel
that
we
were
--
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
no,
because
we
could
not
have
sued
owen
directly
originally,
but
it
was
a
proper
and
clear
under
rule
14
by
omaha
public
power
district
and
then
--
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
basically,
the
omaha
public
power
district
alleged
that
owen
was
negligent,
and
therefore,
made
them
a
third
party
defendant.
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
yes.
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
yes,
it
is
the
old
a
against
b,
b
against
c,
is
there
a
question
of
can
c
counter
claim
against
a,
comments
of
mr.
justice
white,
i
believe
pointed
that
up
and
a
cannot
proceed
against
c.
i
do
not
think
that
is
so.
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
your
honor
when
i
say
cases
i
felt
that
perhaps
the
word
law
and
when
i
say
law.
i
felt
perhaps
i
was
referring
to
awe
of
the
legal
writers,
moore,
wright
&
a.
miller
everyone.
cases
holding
that,
yes
your
honor.
cases
that
were
persuasive
in
nebraska.
the
opinion
of
the
honorable
robert
van
pelt
in
two
cases.
the
cases
if
you
want
to
see,
it
is
in
the
brief.
robert
van
pelt
in
nebraska
had
held
that
exactly
in
two
district
court
cases,
two
district
court
cases.
robert
van
pelt,
his
honor
in
nebraska
was
a
highly
regarded
judge.
they
are
district
court
opinions.
i
think
we
have
a
difficulty
in
connection
with
case
law
in
this
in
that
in
most
cases,
in
most
cases,
the
statute
of
limitations
has
not
run
and
if
a
district
court
rules
against
the
existence
of
the
third
party
claim
that
would
rather
than
go
through
let
us
say
expense,
uncertainty
of
an
appeal
that
many
district
court
cases
are
allowed
to
remain
one
way
or
the
other
because
the
state
court
remedy
is
still
available.
in
other
words,
rather
than
take
the
chance
of
simply
file
in
state
court.
i
think
that
even
in
kenrose
which
is
the
case
that
is
urged
most
vigorously
by
the
petitioner,
even
in
kenrose,
there
is
some
possible
interpretation
of
the
perhaps
reluctance
to
abide
by
a
hard
and
fast
prohibitory
rule.
in
that
particular
instance
in
kenrose,
the
court
did
say,
kenrose
was
in
1971,
in
september
of
1975,
the
fourth
circuit
again
had
the
idea
of
the
situation
where
they
approached
this
particular
problem.
they
said
this.
they
said
in
kenrose
v.
fred
whitaker,
we
broadly
held
that
there
must
be
an
independent
basis
of
jurisdiction
of
a
claim
by
the
plaintiff
against
a
third
party
defendant.
then
in
the
footnote,
they
said
after
kenrose
was
decided
and
they
cited
another
section
of
the
case
previously
decided
and
then
they
say
this,
were
we
inclined
and
they
are
talking
about
these
harsh
prohibitory
rule,
were
we
inclined
under
any
other
context
to
reconsider
the
absolute
rule
of
kenrose,
we
would
not
find
it
appropriate
to
do
so
here.
in
other
words,
what
we
are
contending,
basically
and
simply
is
this,
that
the
presence
of
rule
without
exception,
of
an
absolute
prohibitory
rule
under
the
circumstances
of
this
particular
case
would
be
unjust
and
equitable.
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
in
that
particular
case,
i
believe
the
facts
were
slightly
dissimilar
your
honor.
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
yes,
and
he
said
the
state
court
remedy
was
then
available
to
the
plaintiff
and
the
plaintiff
state
court
remedy
in
kenrose
i
assume
was
available
and
no
statute
was
run
upon
and
it
was
decided
--
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
the
day
we
filed
in
federal
court?
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
i
believe
that
if
in
our
situation
with
owen
being
in
there
as
proper,
we
could
not
have
filed.
in
other
words,
if
we
have
filed
in
state
court,
after
owen,
after
oppd
and
pleaded
owen,
and
then
we
filed
an
action
in
state
court
against
owen,
i
feel
that
owen
we
were
all
properly
in
federal
court,
under
not
only
our
local
rule.
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
i
believe
we
could
have
filed
it
as
of
the
date
we
filed
our
amended
complaint
your
honor.
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
the
timetable
is
fairly
complicated.
i
think
it
makes
it
clear.
in
other
words,
in
january
1974,
the
iowa
statute
of
limitations
ran.
on
that
particular
date,
all
three
parties
were
properly
in
federal
court
and
there
is
no
one
who
would
quarrel
with
that,
all
three
parties
were
properly
in
federal
court.
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
yes,
your
honor,
we
contend
that
it
was.
for
the
same
reason
that
mr.
justice
white
mentioned
that
c
could
have
sued
a
and
it
would
be
highly
unjust
if
they
could
not
sue
c.
we
feel
that
that
remedy
and
our
position
is
as
follows.
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
why
did
not
we
sue
c
in
the
first
place
because
we
did
not
even
know
about
c
in
the
first
place?
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
no.
the
situation
was
this,
mr.
justice
stevens.
we
sued
because
we
felt
that
the
power
lines
had
killed
our
client’s
husband.
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
i
am
talking
about
a
against
b
now.
our
client
against
power
district,
our
client
in
iowa.
power
district,
nebraska.
so
we
brought
our
action
properly
there.
does
that
answer
your
question
or
did
your
question
go
beyond
that?
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
why
did
you
not
sue
owen
in
the
first
place?
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
because
the
evidence
against
owen,
in
other
words,
the
defectiveness
of
their
claims
seems
like
that
was
developed
later.
we
felt
that
the
primary,
the
first
theory
of
suit
that
we
had
was
that
those
wires
should
not
have
been
allowed
there
in
the
presence
of
moving
cranes.
the
crane
was
owned
by
owen
erection
and
equipment
company.
it
was
operated,
however,
by
an
employee
of
paxton
vierling.
paxton
vierling
was
also
the
employer
of
our
client?
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
of
course.
it
turned
out
that
that
situation
was
not
true
at
all
because
under
the
borrowed
servant
rule
of
iowa,
it
was
not
under
workman’s
compensation.
i
explained
it
as
well
as
i
could.
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
yes.
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
on
the
third
day
of
trial,
your
honor.
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
that
was
1976.
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
what
my
adversary
refers
to
is
the
fact
that
a
deposition
was
taken
in
the
offices
of
the
paxton
vierling
company
in
which
they
say,
you
should
have
known.
they
themselves
say
--
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
you
should
have
known
that
this
was
an
iowa
resident.
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
owen,
yes.
then
they
filed
an
affidavit
after
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
in
which
they
say
that
for
the
first
time,
they
knew
on
the
third
day
of
trial
when
the
local
counsel,
in
other
words,
the
corporate
counsel
for
the
company
called
their
attention
to
it.
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
pardon?
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
stating
that
they
became
aware
of
the
fact
that
their
principal
place
of
business
only
on
the
third
day
of
the
trial
and
we
in
our
brief
objected
to
that
and
i
object
to
it
here
because
of
the
fact
that
it
was
an
ex
parte
affidavit
filed
after
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
in
this
case
and
it
was
not
subject
to
cross
examination.
if
it
had
been
subject
to
cross
examination,
it
would
certainly
have
fallen
because
the
charter
of
the
company
names
its
principal
place
of
business
as
being
in
the
state
of
nebraska
which
i
have
attached
as
an
appendix
in
the
same
manner
that
they
attached
their
affidavit
as
an
appendix.
their
affidavit
was
an
affidavit
of
one
attorney
for
the
defendant
in
favor
of
another
attorney
for
the
defendant.
my
affidavit
was
from
the
secretary
of
state
of
the
state
of
nebraska.
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
yes,
both
in
the
records
of
the
state
of
nebraska
and
records
of
the
state
of
iowa
and
had
this
matter
been
raised
earlier,
this
would
have
been
producible
for
the
record
at
that
time.
even
with
respect
to
the
records
of
the
state
of
iowa
where
they
applied
for
permission
to
do
business
in
the
state
of
iowa,
their
principal
place
of
business
and
if
counsel
urges
this,
this
is
a
certificate
from
the
state
of
iowa,
from
the
secretary
of
state
of
the
state
of
iowa
in
which
they
applied
to
do
business
in
the
state
of
iowa,
in
the
germane
times
to
this
case
and
say
in
effect,
their
principal
place
of
business
did
not
stay
in
nebraska
and
they
are
apply
for
permission
and
authority
from
the
state
of
iowa
to
do
business
in
that
state.
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
i
know
where
the
principal
place
of
business
is
your
honor.
pardon.
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
in
the
record,
everyone
at
trial
time
because
it
was
a
sudden
thing.
i
would
say
that
this
case
was
given
birth
to
in
a
spirit
of
judicial
economy,
i
personally
and
i
am
a
small
office,
and
i
have
two
other
attorneys,
both
young
attorneys,
almost
students,
i
was
personally
engaged
in
state
trial.
at
that
particular
time,
the
word
came
from
the
united
states
district
court,
we
are
going
to
start
the
owen
case
because
it
is
one
of
the
oldest
cases
on
the
docket.
it
was
because
it
had
been
up
the
court
of
appeals
and
back.
i
said,
i
cannot
walk
out
of
a
state
court
case.
i
called
the
judge.
his
bailiff
said
no,
it
is
the
oldest
case
on
the
docket.
send
somebody
else
down.
i
did.
i
had
to.
you
may
look
on
federal
judges
from
hearing,
but
we
look
at
them
as
godlike
and
when
they
say
come
down
and
try
the
case
and
if
you
cannot
do
it,
send
somebody
from
your
office.
i
had
one
choice.
i
sent
my
young
lawyer
down.
perhaps
in
the
heat
of
battle
and
i
am
certainly
not
disparaging
in
any
way
shape
or
form
from
his
efforts.
in
the
heat
of
battle,
perhaps
--
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
they
were
at
that
time
of
trial,
they
were
under
the
records
of
nebraska,
they
were
on
the
records
of
iowa.
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
i
know
it
is
not
in
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
no,
i
after
very
frankly
just
on
april
7
of
1978,
i
thought
to
myself
--
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
yes,
it
is
a
public
document.
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
it
is
a
public
document.
i
do
not
know.
it
is
a
public
document
of
the
state
of
iowa,
office
of
the
secretary
of
state.
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
the
contrary
affidavit
after
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
was
filed.
it
was
subscribed
to
about
the
29th
of
june.
the
date
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
preceded
that
by
a
substantial
length
of
time
and
our
affidavit,
the
secretary
of
state
of
the
state
of
nebraska
was
filed
as
a
counter
affidavit
to
that.
the
date
of
the
opinion
was
june
21,
1977.
the
day
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
eight
circuit
was
june
21,
1977.
the
date
of
the
affidavit
was
as
i
mentioned
after
that
time.
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
yes
and
then
we
included
in
our
brief
a
copy
of
the
affidavit
for
the
secretary
of
state
of
the
state
of
nebraska
which
says
the
principal
place
of
business
is
in
nebraska
and
also
available
would
have
been
a
secretary
of
state’s
certification
of
the
state
of
iowa
that
they
applied
to
do
business
in
the
state
of
iowa
and
naming
the
principal
place
of
business
as
omaha,
nebraska,
30
something
farm
street.
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
no,
your
honor.
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
no,
we
did
not.
that
was
one
of
the
unfairness
and
the
disadvantages
of
having
the
thing
blasted
at
my
young
associate
in
the
middle
of
a
trial
that
concerned
not
only
one
issue,
but
several
very
complicated
issues.
we
took
the
word
of
the
secretary
of
the
owen
corporation.
mr.
warren
c.
schrempp
no,
it
came
up
that
fast.
