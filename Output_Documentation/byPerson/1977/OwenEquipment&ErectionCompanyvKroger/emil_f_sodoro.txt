mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
it
pleases
the
court,
gentlemen.
we
stand
before
this
court
today
on
the
case
of
owen
v.
kroger
which
has
basically
a
single
issue
to
present
to
you
and
the
issue
generally
stated
is
on
a
state
court
claim,
can
the
plaintiff
in
a
civil
action
in
the
federal
court
file
a
direct
claim
against
a
third
party
defendant
with
whom
the
plaintiff
shares
common
citizenship
or
take
it
as
just
one
step
further
in
this
particular
case,
gentlemen,
what
we
have
is
a
plaintiff
who
maintains
a
suit
against
a
defendant
who
is
not
in
comity
with
her
citizenship,
who
files
a
third
party
complaint
and
that
is
our
client
in
this
particular
case
against
a
third
party
defendant
and
then
the
original
defendant
is
excused
from
the
proceedings
on
a
motion
for
a
summary
judgment.
it
is
our
contention
--
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
he
moved
for
a
summary
judgment.
there
was
a
hearing
before
district
judge
denny.
he
sustained
the
motion
for
a
summary
judgment
and
that
motion
for
a
summary
judgment
was
in
fact
appealed
by
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
to
the
eight
circuit
court
which
affirmed
the
judgment
sustaining
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
at
that
stage,
after
that
original
defendant
was
excused
and
i
use
that
word
appropriately
i
think,
dismissed
perhaps
is
a
better
word,
your
honor,
dismissed
from
the
suit.
what
we
had
was
an
administratrix
of
an
estate
who
was
a
citizen
of
iowa
who
by
this
time
now,
had
filed
a
direct
claim
in
the
original
federal
district
court
proceedings
against
the
third
party
defendant.
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
yes
sir,
your
honor
that
was
on
the
basis
of
an
amended
complaint.
so
at
this
juncture,
the
original
defendant
is
not
longer
a
party
to
this
case
and
what
we
have
is
that
the
plaintiff
at
this
stage
of
the
proceedings
and
the
defendant
for
the
purposes
of
diversity
of
citizenship
which
is
a
demand
for
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
court
were
both
residents
of
the
same
state.
originally,
this
accident
arises
out
of
a
complex
set
of
facts
and
i
am
sure
that
you
are
aware
of
the
facts
and
i
would
not
belabor
them
with
you.
but
this
is
a
suit
for
damages
that
arises
out
of
a
claim
for
wrongful
death
that
occurred
while
the
plaintiff’s
decedent
was
in
the
course
of
his
employment.
one
of
the
issues
or
one
of
the
matters
that
was
also
involved
in
this
case
that
made
it
additionally
complex
to
keep
the
parties
straight,
was
that
fact
that
when
the
plaintiff
originally
filed
this
suit,
the
employer
of
the
plaintiff
which
was
also
an
iowa
resident,
the
paxton
and
vierling
company
was
made
a
party
defendant
and
federal
district
judge
denny
in
order
to
retain
the
jurisdiction,
realigned
the
parties.
that
original
defendant
employer
was
made
a
defendant
only
for
the
purpose
of
subrogation
of
the
workman’s
compensation
claims.
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
that
is
right
your
honor
and
it
was
for
that
reason
as
i
say
that
the
trial
judge,
judge
denny
realigned
that
party
and
in
effect
made
the
paxton
vierling
company
which
was
an
employer,
a
party
claimant
for
the
purpose
of
retaining
jurisdiction
of
the
case
and
as
you
say,
their
interests
were
in
fact
aligned.
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
it
was
really
part
of
the
original
lawsuit
as
was
treated
in
this
case.
what
happened
was
the
parties
were
simply
realigned,
justice
marshall.
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
that
is
right.
actually,
as
the
case
was
originally
filed
and
you
have
got
it
exactly,
there
was
no
diversity
of
citizenship
that
would
confer
jurisdiction
on
the
federal
district
court
because
there
was
no
federal
question
involved
and
by
the
admission
of
the
plaintiff
in
that
original
complaint,
one
of
the
parties
was
a
resident
of
the
same
state
as
was
the
plaintiff.
i
am
glad
that
you
noticed
that.
but
in
any
event,
this
case
finally
came
for
trial
and
the
question
as
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
and
it
is
our
contention
that
the
federal
district
court
never
had
any
jurisdiction
to
hear
and
decide
the
case
between
the
petitioner
that
stands
before
you
today
and
the
respondent
for
the
reason
and
again
very
simply
stated
this
is
not
a
complex
case,
at
least
as
we
view
it
because
there
was
no
diversity
of
citizenship
between
the
respective
parties
that
were
involved
in
the
litigation.
judge
denny,
the
trier
of
the
case
and
his
declaration
is
in
the
record,
said
that
felt
that
this
was
a
case
where
he
had
to
decide
whether
it
was
a
matter
of
pendant
or
ancillary
jurisdiction.
now,
we
have
searched
the
authorities,
every
authority
possible
and
it
seems
that
there
is
not
any
question
that
the
federal
courts,
once
they
have
the
original
jurisdiction
between
a
plaintiff
and
a
diverse
defendant
that
that
defendant
may
make
a
third
party
defendant
who
is
a
resident
or
a
citizen
of
the
same
state
as
the
original
defendant,
no
question
about
that.
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
as
the
original
plaintiff
or
the
original
defendant.
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
yes,
and
i
see
no
problem
with
that.
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
i
see
no
problem
with
that,
but
the
problem
that
arises
here,
justice
stewart
is
in
that,
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
was
permitted
to
file
a
direct
claim,
do
you
not
see
against
that
third
party
defendant.
now,
we
can
find
no
cases
in
any
jurisdictions
in
the
federal
court
that
permit
such
a
practice.
let
alone
find
any
case
particularly
where
the
original
defendant
is
removed
or
excused
or
dismissed
from
the
case
that
permits
any
such
practice.
gentlemen,
it
would
be
really
i
think
a
waste
of
your
time
for
me
to
reiterate
and
to
read
to
you
the
portions
of
our
brief.
i
am
sure
you
are
acquainted
with
that,
but
it
was
our
feeling
and
it
is
our
contention
today
that
judge
denny
was
mistaken,
that
this
is
not
a
case
for
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
it
is
a
matter
of
pendant
or
ancillary
jurisdiction.
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
in
part,
but
not
necessarily.
our
principal
argument
is
that
the
plaintiff
could
not
do
what
she
did
here
because
she
was
not
entitled
to
do
it
under
federal
practice.
there
was
no
jurisdiction
that
would
inure
to
the
federal
court.
it
is
true
that
that
has
some
bearing
and
some
effect,
but
here
is
what
it
is,
your
honor.
the
plaintiff
ends
up
suing
in
the
federal
court
a
person
who
is
a
citizen
of
the
same
state
as
the
plaintiff
and
we
submit
that
there
is
no
authority
for
that
type
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
it
has
a
substantial
effect.
you
have
to
assume
it
this
way,
your
honor.
let
us
say
that
the
plaintiff
instead
of
filing
only
her
lawsuit
against
the
defendant
would
file
her
lawsuit
against
both
the
defendant
and
the
third
party
defendant.
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
there
would
be
no
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
court.
all
of
the
cases
have
that
as
their
holding.
you
cannot
do
indirectly,
you
see
what
you
are
not
permitted
to
do
by
way
of
jurisdiction
directly.
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
yes,
sir
justice
brennan.
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
on
the
record,
that
is
generally
an
exact
statement.
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
not
exactly.
that
generally
is
what
happened.
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
that
was
revealed
when
you
say
to
the
court
--
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
to
the
parties.
please
let
me
answer
that
one
your
honor.
on
the
3rd
day
of
june
1974
--
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
the
trial
commenced
your
honor
on
the
12th
day
of
january
1976.
here
is
how
it
came
about
so
that
the
parties
had
knowledge
of
the
location
of
the
principal
place
of
business
of
this
third
party
defendant,
our
client,
the
petitioner
here.
the
deposition
was
being
taken
pursuant
to
request
by
the
plaintiff,
not
pursuant
to
notice,
but
pursuant
to
production
of
the
witnesses,
the
attorney
for
the
plaintiff
said,
i
want
to
see
the
books
and
records
of
the
owen
equipment
and
construction
company
and
i
want
to
take
the
depositions
of
the
officers
and
by
agreement,
that
was
done
at
the
headquarters
of
this
petitioner
on
the
3rd
day
of
june
1974
and
their
headquarters
are
located
in
carter
lake,
iowa.
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
yes
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
your
description
generally
is
accurate
except
that
it
is
not
a
nubbin
that
is
part
of
the
city
of
omaha.
it
is
out
of
the
city
of
omaha.
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
out
near
the
airport,
exactly
and
what
you
have
there
is
when
the
states
were
originally
divided
by
the
missouri
river,
there
was
a
bend
in
the
river
and
that
bend
in
the
river
somehow
(inaudible)
to
the
east
and
there
is
a
piece
of
land
despite
the
fact
that
it
is
located
on
the
west
side
of
the
missouri
river
that
is
really
a
part
of
iowa
and
that
is
a
very
well
known
fact
in
our
community
because
the
city
of
omaha
is
always
complaining
that
they
have
to
render
certain
services
to
the
city
of
carter
lake,
iowa
and
real
estate
taxes
and
the
state
income
taxes
and
the
state
sales
tax
has
to
go
over
to
des
monies
over
to
iowa.
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
i
think
that
is
pretty
general
knowledge
because
there
is
a
community,
there
is
a
city
that
is
known
as
the
city
of
carter
lake,
iowa.
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
they
have
a
city
hall,
they
have
a
mayor
and
they
have
city
council
men.
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
not
in
the
least
and
particularly
with
respect
to
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
your
honor,
our
original
answer
that
was
filed
to
the
amended
complaint
as
filed
by
the
respondent
--
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
your
honor,
the
plaintiff’s
amended
complaint
was
filed
directly
against
owen
on
november
9,
1973.
there
after
on
november
27,
1973,
we
filed
an
answer
on
behalf
of
owen
and
in
that
answer
admitted
that
the
owen
erection
and
equipment
company
was
a
corporation
existing
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
nebraska
because
that
is
a
fact
and
then
went
on
to
deny
generally
all
of
the
other
allegations
of
the
plaintiff’s
amended
complaint
against
owen.
one
of
the
allegations
--
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
we
did
not
at
that
time.
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
that
was
raised
on
the
record.
first
of
all,
as
i
told
you
on
the
3rd
of
june
1974,
when
that
deposition
was
taken,
those
questions
and
those
answers
were
given
in
response
to
interrogation
made
by
the
attorney
for
the
plaintiff,
but
the
formal
request
or
the
formal
filing
of
a
motion
to
dismiss
was
not
filled
and
the
reason
it
was
not
filed
is
very
honestly,
we
did
not
give
it
the
adequate
consideration
that
this
issue
deserved
and
i
submit
that
to
you
and
tell
you
that
absolutely.
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
sir,
the
statute
of
limitations
is
two
years
in
iowa
and
the
statute
of
limitations
in
this
case
had
run
on
the
18th
day
of
january
1974.
yes,
sir.
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
i
agree
with
the
last
portion
of
your
statement.
it
is
my
understanding
and
i
have
been
a
lawyer
for
27
years
that
the
allegations
and
the
claims
that
are
made
by
a
plaintiff
against
any
party
in
the
proceeding
must
be
proven
by
that
plaintiff.
that
is
the
law
i
think
in
almost
every
jurisdiction.
the
burden
of
proving
the
claims
that
are
made
by
the
plaintiff
must
be
made
by
the
plaintiff.
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
unless
they
are
admitted
in
the
pleadings
and
in
this
case,
we
filed
a
general
denial
as
to
every
claim
made
by
the
plaintiff
again
in
our
petition
against
us,
or
an
amended
complaint
against
us
except
the
fact
that
the
corporation,
the
owens
equipment
and
erecting
company
was
in
fact
incorporated
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
nebraska.
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
in
effect,
that
is
our
position
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
let
me
say
this,
your
honor.
at
the
time
the
answer
was
filed
and
i
have
told
you
already
and
i
am
more
than
happy
to
tell
you
again,
this
issue
did
not
deserve
in
our
office
the
type
of
consideration
that
it
did.
it
was
called
to
our
attention
as
you
will
see
in
the
affidavit
that
is
filed
in
part
of
the
appendix
in
this
case.
let
me
just
for
a
second
back
up
and
explain
this
matter
too.
our
office
is
not
the
corporate
office
or
the
corporate
attorneys
for
the
owen
equipment
company.
on
the
morning
that
this
case
was
to
commence
for
trial,
we
were
satisfied
with
our
pleading
at
that
time
in
our
answer.
we
were
suspect
to
the
fact
that
his
was
an
iowa
corporation,
but
had
not
developed
that
theory
and
had
not
worked
it
out.
the
corporate
counsel
--
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
we
were
at
that
same
deposition
in
june
of
1974.
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
yes,
sir
we
did.
we
knew
that
on
the
3rd
day
of
june
1974
because
we
were
present
your
honor
at
the
same
time
the
attorneys
--
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
not
really.
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
we
denied
it.
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
let
me
say
this
to
you.
the
facts,
we
were
suspect
of
that
fact,
but
not
satisfied
completely
one
way
or
the
other,
your
honor.
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
we
intended
that
as
a
denial
because
it
says
that,
do
you
not
see?
those
are
the
words
spelled
out
on
the
answer.
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
rule
8
(b)
provides
i
think
generally,
your
honor
to
the
effect
that
--
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
the
thing
speaks
for
itself
and
you
are
entitled
to
admit
portions
of
affirmance
and
entitled
to
generally
deny
the
rest
of
them
and
that
is
what
we
did
in
this
case.
but
i
submit
to
you
along
these
lines
sir
and
gentlemen
that
the
question
of
jurisdiction
of
the
court
is
something
that
can
be
raised
at
any
time.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
conduct
of
the
parties,
all
of
the
authorities
indicate
and
indicate
substantially
that
you
cannot
be
estopped,
that
the
jurisdiction
cannot
be
created
when
it
did
not
otherwise
exist
and
it
is
our
position
that
the
jurisdiction
did
not
exist
when
the
plaintiff,
the
respondent
here,
filed
her
claim
against
us.
it
is
our
position
that
this
is
not
a
matter
of
pendant
or
ancillary
jurisdiction.
that
facts
and
circumstances
presented
here
create
an
exact
problem
of
original
jurisdiction
between
two
parties
who
are
residents
of
the
same
states.
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
i
am
sorry
sir
what,
i
did
not
get
you?
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
right.
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
absolutely.
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
yes
sir.
they
have
authorities
for
all
of
that.
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
that
the
plaintiff
can
never
claim
against
the
third
party
defendant
and
i
think
that
the
authority
--
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
well,
your
honor
i
--
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
the
theory
is
that
the
plaintiff
selects
the
forum
for
the
trial
and
disposition
of
the
plaintiff’s
claim.
the
theory
that
permits
ancillary
proceedings
by
a
defendant
where
you
have
the
original
diversity
of
citizenship
between
the
original
two
parties,
the
theory
is
that
this
now
is
ancillary
proceeding
between
the
original
defendant
who
becomes
the
third
party
plaintiff
and
the
third
party
defendant.
that
is
the
ancillary
portion
of
the
proceedings
and
the
courts
have
indicated
that
that
is
perfectly
okay
that
that
falls
within
the
purview
of
the
jurisdictions
of
the
federal
courts.
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
because
the
plaintiff
did
not
unless
there
is
diversity
of
citizenship
between
that
plaintiff
--
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
but
the
reason
for
that
is
your
honor
is
that
it
goes
in
conformity
with
rule
14
of
the
federal
rules
and
procedure.
now,
i
would
like
to
retain
if
i
might
gentlemen
just
a
few
minutes
left
in
my
argument.
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
know
it
is
there
and
i
certainly
wish
to
make
no
comment
about
it
at
this
time.
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
let
me
say
fairly
and
honestly,
i
do
not
know
if
there
is
a
clear
cut
answer.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
and
i
thank
you.
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
i
do
indeed
your
honor.
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
of
course
not.
it
is
not
in
the
record
in
this
case.
not
at
all.
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
i
do
not
think
that
is
possible
sir.
but
after
you
hear
me
in
this
regard,
you
will
find
that
there
is
no
reason
for
that.
first
of
all,
let
me
say
this,
there
is
a
judicial
finding
by
judge
denny
in
the
record
in
this
case
which
is
to
the
effect
that
this
petitioner
before
this
court
today
is
in
fact
an
iowa
resident.
bear
in
mind
gentlemen
that
there
are
two
places
that
a
corporation
can
exist
for
purposes
of
jurisdiction
under
the
law
which
grants
jurisdiction
to
the
federal
court.
one
place
of
course
is
the
place
that
it
is
domiciled,
where
the
articles
of
incorporation
are
filed.
no
question
about
that,
but
the
congress
of
the
united
states
have
declared
by
law
that
an
additional
place
of
corporate
existence
is
where
that
corporation
has
its
principal
place
of
business.
in
an
order
to
clear
the
record
absolutely
complete
for
you,
mr.
justice
brennan
particularly
with
regard
to
your
question
to
mr.
schrempp,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
answer
to
that
question
was
accurate
with
respect
to
the
record
and
i
would
like
to
straighten
the
record
out
for
you.
in
that
regard,
the
allegation
made
by
the
respondent
here
against
the
petitioner
was
this
--
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
i
know
it
by
heart,
but
i
do
not
know
if
i
can
find
it.
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
would
you
please
look
at
the
appendix,
page
number
23,
amended
complaint
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
gentlemen
under
paragraph
ii,
the
recitation
made
by
this
plaintiff
in
her
direct
claim
now
against
the
defendant
is
that
the
defendant,
omaha
public
power
district,
a
public
corporation
is
a
public
corporation
organized
and
existing
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
nebraska
in
having
its
principal
place
of
business
in
omaha,
douglas
county,
nebraska;
that
the
defendant,
owen
equipment
and
erection
company
is
a
corporation
with
its
principal
place
of
business
in
nebraska.
now,
our
answer
demanded
strict
proof
you
see
of
this
allegation.
strict
proof
that
in
order
for
the
federal
court
to
have
jurisdiction
over
the
defendant,
then
it
became
necessary
upon
this
plaintiff
to
prove
in
the
case
where
we
end
up
being
the
direct
defendant
to
prove
that
we
were
in
fact
a
nebraska
corporation
and
that
our
principal
place
of
business
was
in
nebraska.
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
right
and
that
is
all.
we
do
not
admit
in
that
answer
that
they
have
as
their
principal
place
of
business
you
see
omaha,
nebraska
and
therefore
our
demand
comes
now
for
the
strict
proof.
the
only
proof
presented
at
the
trial
in
connection
with
the
resident
or
the
citizenship
of
the
defendant,
owen,
the
only
proof
was
the
proof
from
the
officers
of
the
owen
equipment
company
which
was
that
their
principal
place
of
business
was
in
iowa
and
judge
denny
therefore
made
a
judicial
finding
that
they
--
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
pardon
sir?
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
i
do
not
know
if
i
can
find
it
for
you
but
it
is
also
recited
in
the
opinion
of
the
eighth
circuit.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
have
cited
in
our
reply
brief
some
of
the
words
from
the
record
as
recited
by
judge
denny
and
on
page
6,
he
says
this,
the
court,
i
do
not
think
they
ever
admitted
anything
and
he
is
referring
now
to
the
defendant,
owens,
i
do
not
think
they
ever
admitted
anything.
the
proof
here
before
this
court
today
by
the
secretary
of
the
owen
equipment
and
erection
company,
their
principal
place
of
business
was
in
carter
lake,
iowa.
that
was
the
only
proof
in
the
trial
of
the
case,
gentlemen.
the
trial
court
in
its
memorandum
is
filed
which
is
also
part
of
the
record
found
this.
“plaintiff,
an
iowa
citizen
alleged
that
jurisdiction
was
based
upon
28
u.s.c
1332
that
the
defendant
is
incorporated
in
the
state
of
nebraska
and
he
has
his
principal
place
of
business
there.
it
is
now
uncontroverted,
however,
that
defendant’s
principal
place
of
business
is
in
the
state
of
iowa.
hence,
an
independent
basis
of
jurisdiction
does
not
exist.
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
then
for
the
purposes
of
the
federal
jurisdiction
statute,
both
those
parties
are
residents
of
the
same
state?
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
so
there
is
no
diversity
of
citizenship
and
all
of
the
decisions
are
to
that
effect.
in
answer
to
one
of
your
earlier
questions,
mr.
justice
white,
you
asked
me
why
is
it
not
then
that
a
plaintiff
could
sue
a
third
party
defendant
if
a
third
party
defendant
under
the
decisions
could
sue
the
original
plaintiff.
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
yes.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
a
careful
reading
of
the
kenrose
v.
fred
whitaker
case
and
what
we
consider
a
very
astute
opinion
by
the
circuit
judge
sets
that
out
exactly
and
precisely
as
being
a
violation
of
the
jurisdictional
requirements
set
forth
by
congress
on
the
federal
courts.
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
i
am
telling
you
that
that
is
that
decision
and
as
a
lawyer,
i
would
like
to
think
that
we
follow
those
decisions.
you
say
why
is
because
the
federal
court
your
honor
is
a
court
of
very
limited
jurisdiction
and
that
was
such
an
important
matter
that
the
framers
and
the
writers
of
our
constitution
in
article
3,
it
makes
that
recitation
and
i
think
that
the
history
of
the
decisions
by
the
federal
courts.
mr.
emil
f.
sodoro
it
appears
that
the
rationale
or
at
least
the
rationale
i
get
from
the
examination
of
the
cases
is,
the
plaintiff
has
selected
the
forum
and
although
has
not
made
a
direct
claim
against
the
third
party
defendant
that
the
third
party
defendant
because
he
is
brought
into
the
case
in
which
he
had
no
participation
concerning
the
institution
then,
has
that
right
as
a
matter
of
defense
of
his
claim
against
the
original
defendant
to
counterclaim
against
the
plaintiff.
gentlemen,
i
think
i
am
out
of
time.
i
wish
to
thank
you
very
much
for
your
courtesy.
