justice

stewart
that
was
an
amended
complaint?
justice
potter
stewart
to
that
extent
the
employer
defendant
would
have
had
more
in
common
with
the
plaintiffs
than
with
the
defendant?
justice
potter
stewart
same
state
as
the
original
plaintiff?
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
original
defendant,
there
is
no
problem
because
presumably
the
original
plaintiff
and
the
original
defendant
were
of
diverse
citizenship.
if
the
third
party
defendant
is
of
the
same
residence
as
the
original
defendant,
then
there
is
no
problem
at
all.
if
you
are
talking
about
a
third
party
practice,
bringing
in
a
defendant
who
is
of
the
same
citizenship
as
the
original
plaintiff.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
permissible,
that
is
established.
justice
potter
stewart
how
come
the
defendant
filed
a
claim
against
a
third
party
defendant
from
the
same
state
he
is?
justice
potter
stewart
the
defendant
in
the
case
may
file
a
third
party
claim
against
a
third
party
defendant
who
is
from
the
same
state
as
he
is?
justice
potter
stewart
that
party
may
file
a
counter
claim?
justice
potter
stewart
he
may
also
file
a
claim
against
the
plaintiff?
justice
potter
stewart
but
your
suggestion
is
the
plaintiff
could
not
counter
claim
against
that
claim?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
what
is
your
justification
for
that?
justice
potter
stewart
the
defendant
could
never
have
sued
the
third
party
defendant
in
the
federal
court?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
sodoro
just
before
you
sit
down
there
was
a
mention
a
few
moments
ago
about
this
statute
of
limitations.
i
note
that
the
dissenting
judge
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
note
42
of
his
dissenting
opinion
appearing
on
appendix
page
32
of
the
petition
for
certiorari
indicates
that
his
belief
that
this
action
would
not
be
barred
by
the
iowa
statute
of
limitations.
if
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
were
reversed,
now
i
appreciate
that
you
do
not
want
to
take
the
position
here
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
right,
but
there
certainly
does
seem
to
be
a
difference
in
opinion,
and
therefore,
perhaps
there
is
no
clear
cut
answer
to
it
at
least
that
is
fair
to
say?
justice
potter
stewart
first
of
these
cases,
owen
equipment
and
erection
company
against
geraldine
kroger
whose
is
the
administratrix
of
the
estate
of
her
late
husband,
is
here
by
a
way
of
the
grant
of
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eight
circuit.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
in
an
action
in
which
federal
jurisdiction
is
based
on
diversity
of
citizenship,
the
plaintiff
may
assert
a
claim
against
a
third
party
defendant
when
there
is
no
independent
basis
for
federal
jurisdiction
over
that
claim.
the
court
of
appeals
held
in
this
case
that
such
a
claim
is
within
the
ancillary
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts.
we
granted
certiorari
because
this
decision
conflicts
with
several
recent
decisions
of
other
courts
of
appeals.
this
is
not
a
case
very
obviously
that
lends
itself
to
interesting
or
even
intelligible
oral
announcement.
i
will
confine
myself
to
saying
therefore
that
for
the
reasons
set
out
and
considerable
detail
in
the
court's
written
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
this
morning,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
mr.
justice
brennan
has
joined.
