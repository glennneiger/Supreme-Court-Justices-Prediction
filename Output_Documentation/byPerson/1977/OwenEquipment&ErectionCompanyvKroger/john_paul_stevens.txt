justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
sodoro,
let
me
just
get
one
thing
straight.
is
your
position
dependent
all
on
the
fact
that
the
original
defendant
was
dismissed
out
of
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
is
that
any
different
in
practical
effect
between
a
suing
b
and
b
having
a
cross
claim
against
c
and
then
everything
is
all
done,
c
pays
b
and
b
pays
a?
is
that
not
the
same
as
c
paying
a
directly?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
there
would
be
no
jurisdiction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
carter
lake,
iowa
is
on
the
west
side
of
the
missouri
river,
is
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
it
have
kind
of
a
nubbin
sticking
into
the
city
of
omaha?
justice
john
paul
stevens
near
the
airport?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
is
why
i
was
asking
whether
everybody
really
did
not
know
what
the
situation
was
at
all
times?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
have
a
city
hall
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
take
it
apart
from
this
aspect
in
the
background,
the
fact
that
it
is
on
the
west
side
of
missouri
does
not
cut
any
ice
in
this
litigation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
sodoro,
did
you
know
that
when
you
filed
your
answer
on
october
15,
1973?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
did
not
really
intend
to
deny
the
allegation
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
denied
it
without
investigating
the
facts?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
asking
us
to
construe
the
answer.
excuse
me.
it
feels
the
answer
as
a
denial
when
you
say
you
did
not
really
intend
it
as
a
denial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
not
have
to
do
differentiate
between
a
verdict
against
owen
on
the
third
party
complaint
brought
by
the
power
district
and
the
verdict
against
owen
on
the
amended
complaint,
but
directly
by
kroger
against
owen?
would
both
issues
would
be
submitted
to
the
jury?
justice
john
paul
stevens
improperly,
i
suppose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words
there
were
two
quite
separate
claims
against
owen.
one
directly
by
your
client
and
secondly
by
omaha
power
district
against
them
indirectly,
is
it
not
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
once
omaha
power
was
out
of
the
case
then
the
third
party
complaint
necessarily
fell
too,
did
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
how
could
they
be
liable
by
way
of
a
third
party
complaint
if
the
third
plaintiff
had
prevailed,
had
been
found
not
liable
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
would
not
justify
a
recovery
on
the
third
party
complaint
because
a
third
party
complaint
is
brought
by
omaha
power
against
owen
and
if
omaha
public
power
had
no
liability
and
had
no
injury
and
nothing
to
recover
over
at
the
third
party
complaint,
did
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
you
recover
only
directly
against
owen
just
as
though
you
never
sued
omaha
power
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
only
in
so
far
as
it
related
to
omaha
powers
claim
over
against
owen.
the
impleader
did
justify
it
unless
i
understand
you,
did
not
justify.
you
are
asserting
an
independent
claim
of
negligence
on
behalf
of
kroger
against
owen,
do
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
you
filed
a
separate
pleading
in
which
you
made
such
allegations?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
question
is
whether
that
pleading
is
one
that
the
federal
court
can
entertain?
justice
john
paul
stevens
either
a
case
is
holding
that
a
can
proceed
directly
against
c?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
are
those
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
prior
to
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
were
properly
in
federal
court,
but
was
it
proper
in
that
case
for
a
to
be
suing
c?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
trying
to
remember
it.
i
know
the
brief
explains
it.
why
did
you
not
sue
c
in
the
first
place?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
are
a
lessee
of
the
employer,
was
that
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
state
court
if
you
were
worried
about
federal
jurisdiction,
why
did
you
sue
them
right
away?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
afraid
it
is
a
workmanâ€™s
compensation
problem?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
in
your
brief.
you
stumbled
into
it
through
discovery
really
is
what
i
am
off
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
schrempp,
did
you
rely
on
that
document
at
any
time
prior
to
the
end
of
the
trial
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
did
not
know
about
it,
did
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
rather
than
the
official
record,
but
you
did
not
check
the
official
record?
