be
interested
in

if
you
have
a

there's
a
finding
to
that
effect.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
cox,
may
i
interrupt
you
with
question
that's
always
troubled
me.
is
the
use
of
the
term
invidious
which
have
all
has
difficulty
really
understanding?
you
suggested
in
response
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
the
number
were
50
rather
than
16.
they'll
be
a
greater
risk
of
a
finding
of
invidious
purpose.
how
does
one
--
how
does
a
judge
decide
when
to
make
such
finding?
justice
harry
a.

let
me
--
let
me
make
my
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
cox,
let
me
make
my
question
a
little
more
precise.
can
you
give
me
a
test
which
would
differentiate
the
case
of
50
students
from
the
case
of
16
students?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
suggest
on
this
question
of
invidiousness
that
there
should
be
a
remand
to
take
further
evidence
to
find
out
among
other
things
why
the
asian-americans
were
included
in
the
program.
supposing
the
evidence
shows
that
the
reason
they
were
included
was
because
they
had
in
the
past
been
the
victims
of
discrimination.
what
inference
should
we
draw
up
in
that
kind
of
conclusion,
would
that
mean
the
program
is
good
or
bad?
is
that
a
sufficient
justification?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
are
you
asking
us
then
mr.
colvin
to
decide
the
federal
statutory
grounds?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
justice
powell
has
stated
that
this
case
is
intrinsically
difficult;
perhaps
so,
perhaps
not.
i
suspect
that
for
those
four
members
of
the
court
who
find
the
title
vi
issue
controlling,
the
case
really
is
not
very
difficult.
but
for
the
five
of
us
who
feel
that
title
vi
does
not
provide
the
answer,
the
case
has
much
deeper
and
more
profound
ramifications.
this
case
like
the
death
penalty
issues
that
had
been
before
the
court
in
years
last
past,
like
the
abortion
cases,
like
the
schools'
desegregation
cases
has
caught
the
popular
interest
and
the
peoples'
deep
concern.
like
each
of
those
it
finds
the
people
as
well
as
justices
divided
in
their
in
their
eight
reactions;
strands
of
heritage
and
strands
of
emotion
and
strands
of
presumption
all
are
plucked
(ph).
for
me,
this
case
is
distinctly
a
constitutional,
not
a
statutory
case
and
because
it
is,
i
have
joined
my
brother
brennan
and
white
and
marshall
in
the
opinion
mr.
justice
brennan
has
just
described.
what
i
have
written
separately,
i
believe
and
i
hope
is
complementary
to
what
is
said
in
the
opinion
for
the
four
of
us.
i
emphasis,
however,
a
number
of
very
general
factors.
first,
until
just
a
few
years
ago,
in
the
early
1970s,
a
very
small
number,
less
than
2%,
of
all
the
physicians
and
all
the
attorneys
and
all
the
students
in
medical
and
law
schools
in
this
country,
were
members
of
what
we
refer
to
as
minority
groups.
and
in
addition
to
this
factor,
almost
three
quarters
of
our
negro
physicians
where
trained
at
only
two
medical
schools;
harvard
here
in
washington
and
meharry
in
nashville
tennessee.
if
ways
are
not
found
to
remedy
that
kind
of
situation,
the
country
will
never
achieve
it's
professed
goal
of
a
society
that
is
not
race-conscious.
second,
i
am
optimistic
that
remedy
will
be
forthcoming
and
i
am
optimistic
that
we
shall
see
a
time
when
race
consciousness
is
a
far
less
significant
factor
in
our
national
life
than
it
is
today.
when
that
time
will
come,
i
do
not
know,
but
when
it
comes,
affirmative
action,
so
called
a
reverse
discrimination
will
be
a
thing
of
the
past.
third;
in
this
case
we
are
considering
not
a
demarcation
between
the
qualified
on
the
one
hand
and
the
unqualified
on
the
other,
but
we
are
considering
a
process
of
selection
among
those
who
are
qualified
to
go
to
medical
school.
it
follows
when
all
those
qualified
cannot
be
admitted
as
is
sadly
the
case
today,
that
there
is
a
denial
to
the
deserving.
this
inescapable
fact
is
brought
into
sharp
focus
here
because
allan
bakke
is
not
himself
charged
with
discrimination
and
yet
he
is
one
who
is
disadvantaged,
and
because
the
medical
school
at
davis
itself
was
not
charged
with
historical
discrimination.
next;
for
me
there
is
particular
or
very
real
significance
in
the
84-16
division
at
davis.
the
same
legal
and
constitutional
considerations
necessarily
apply
if
the
davis
special
administration
program
had
focused
on
any
lesser
number,
that
is,
on
12
or
8
or
4
or
indeed,
on
only
one
place.
it
is
somewhat
ironic
to
have
us
so
deeply
disturbed
by
this
case
which
concerns
a
program
where
race
is
an
element
of
consciousness,
and
yet
for
all
of
us
to
be
aware
of
the
fact,
and
to
know
that
our
institutions
of
higher
learning
long
have
given
and
still
do
give
conceded
preference
up
to
a
point
to
accomplished
or
promising
athletes,
to
the
children
of
alumni,
to
the
affluent
and
to
those
who
have
connections
with
celebrities,
and
the
famous,
and
the
powerful.
next;
it
seems
to
me
that
the
programs
of
admission
are
basically
a
responsibility
for
academicians.
the
judiciary
is
ill-equipped
and
poorly
trained
for
this
task.
management
of
a
university
or
of
a
professional
school
is
within
the
special
competence
of
educators.
interference
by
the
judiciary,
therefore,
must
be
the
rare
exception,
and
not
the
rule.
next;
i
agree
with
mr.
justice
powell
that
today's
philosophical
conception
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
he
has
set
forth
in
his
opinion,
embraces
a
so
called
“broader
principle”
than
the
amendment
did
when
it
was
adopted
in
1868,
110
years
ago.
but
for
me
that
enlargement
does
not
mean,
not
the
fourteenth
amendment
has
broken
away
from
its
moorings
and
from
its
original
intended
purpose,
those
original
aims
still
persist
and
that,
in
a
distinct
sense,
is
what
"affirmative
action,"
is
all
about.
if
this
conflicts
with
idealistic
equality
or
with
pure
equal
protection,
any
such
tension
of
that
kind
is
original
fourteenth
amendment
tension,
and
it
is
constitutionally
conceived
and
constitutionally
proposed.
i
am
not
convinced
as
mr.
justice
powell
is
that
the
difference
between
the
davis
program
and
those
employed
by
the
amici
here
harvard
and
stanford
and
pennsylvania
and
columbia,
is
constitutionally
significant.
certainly,
the
line
between
the
two
is
a
thin
is
one.
and
i
say
this
because
in
each
program
subjective
application
is
at
work.
i
do
agree
that
the
harvard
type
program
where
race
or
ethnic
background
is
only
one
of
many
factors,
is
a
program
probably
better
formulated
than
two-track
system
at
davis
and
yet
the
cynical
may
say
that
under
the
harvard
program,
one
may
accomplish
covertly
what
davis
says
it
does
openly.
i
think
it
is
worth
noting
that
governmental
preference
is
not
a
stranger
to
our
legal
life.
we
certainly
see
it
in
veterans'
preference
legislation,
we
certainly
see
it
in
the
aid-to-the-handicapped
programs.
we
see
it
in
the
progressive
income
tax,
we
see
it
in
the
indian
programs.
we
accept
some
of
these
on
the
the
ground
that
they
have
special
constitutional
protection
or
as
with
indians,
that
they
are
wards
of
the
government.
nevertheless,
the
preferences
exist,
and
we
have
accepted
them.
i
suspect
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
arrange
an
affirmative
action
program
in
a
racially
neutral
way
and
to
have
it
successful,
that
almost
demands
the
impossible.
in
order
to
get
beyond
racism,
we
must
first
take
account
of
race.
and
in
order
to
treat
some
persons
equally,
we
must
treat
them
differently.
we
cannot
and
i
think
we
dare
not
let
the
equal
protection
clause
of
all
the
provisions
in
the
constitution
perpetuate
racial
supremacy.
and
so
for
me
the
ultimate
question,
as
it
was
at
the
very
beginning,
it
is
this;
among
the
qualified,
how
does
one
choose?
and
putting
that
one
in
the
framework
of
constitutional
considerations
and
requirements,
it
seems
to
me
that
we
get
back
to
basics.
at
the
risk
of
being
repetitious,
i
think
it
brings
back
what
a
very
great
chief
justice,
known
as
the
great
chief
justice,
said
a
long
time
ago,
or
he
pointed
the
way.
“in
considering
this
question,
then,
we
must
never
forget,
that
it
is
a
constitution,
we
are
expounding."
and
later
in
mcculloch
against
maryland,
he
went
on,
in
words
that
i
think
are
particularly
appropriate
for
this
case,
"let
the
end
be
legitimate,
let
it
be
within
the
scope
of
the
constitution,
and
all
means,
all
means
which
are
appropriate,
which
are
plainly
adopted
to
that
end,
which
are
not
prohibited,
but
consist
with
the
letter
and
spirit
of
the
constitution,
are
constitutional."
more
recently,
one
destined
to
become
a
justice
of
this
court
said
this,
“the
great
generalities
of
the
constitution
have
a
content
and
a
significance
that
vary
from
age
to
age."
well,
those
are
precepts
of
breadth
and
flexibility
and
ever-present
modernity
so
far
as
our
constitution
is
concerned.
they
are
precepts
basic
to
our
constitutional
law
and
today
again,
for
the
four
of
us
anyway,
or
five
of
us
i
think,
we
expound
a
constitution
and
the
same
principles
that
governed
mcculloch's
case
in
1819,
govern
bakke's
case
in
1977
and
78.
for
me
there
can
be
no
other
answer
and
there
is
no
alternative.
