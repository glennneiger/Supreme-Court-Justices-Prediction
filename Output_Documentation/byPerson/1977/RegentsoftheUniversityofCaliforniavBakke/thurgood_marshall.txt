justice
thurgood
marshall
am
i
correct
that
dr.
lowrey
was
not
dean
when
this
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
was
not
dean
when
all
this
occurred,
was
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
was
he
dean
when
this
regulation
was
put
into
effect.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
my
point
is
--
if
i
may
finish
point.
did
you
put
on
any
evidence
as
to
what
happened?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
you
had
was
hearsay.
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
you
take
a
deposition
of
anybody
who
knew
what
happened.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
couldn't
answer
that
simply
by
yes
or
no.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
was
the
decision
of
the
committee
of
the
faculty?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
no.
i
mean,
when
the
rules
were
set
up.
what
were
the
rules?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
about
the
8%
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
8%
was
before
and
now
it's
16.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
no
16
people.
16
people.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
does
the
rule
say
16%?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,
16.
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
is
the
rule
in
the
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
in
dr.
lowrey's
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
there's
no
other
thing
there
except
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that's
hearsay.
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
only
point
i
say
is
that
we
don't
know
how
the
rule
came
about.
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what
else
do
we
know?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now
what
criteria
was
set
down
for
disadvantaged?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he's
talking
about
the
present
time
when
he
was
testifying.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i'm
trying
to
find
out
what
happened
when
it
was
adopted.
i
guess
i
--
there's
no
way
for
me
to
find
that
out
with
this
record.
justice
thurgood
marshall
your
client
did
compete
for
the
84
seats,
didn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
lost.
justice
thurgood
marshall
now
would
your
argument
be
the
same
if
one
instead
of
16
seats
were
left
open?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
--
my
question
is
would
you
make
the
same
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
didn't
say,
anything
about
him
being,
i
said
that
the
regulation
said
that
one
seat
would
be
left
open
for
an
underprivileged
minority
person?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
would
argue
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
numbers
are
just
not
important.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you're
arguing
about
keeping
somebody
out
and
the
other
side
is
arguing
by
getting
somebody
in?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
it
depends
on
which
way
you
look
at
it,
doesn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
does?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
does?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
does?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you're
talking
about
your
client's
rights,
don't
these
underprivileged
people
have
some
rights?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
some
of
what
i
have
to
say
will
be
repetitious
but
i
feel
obliged
to
say
it.
i
agree
with
the
judgment
of
the
court,,
this
court
only
insofar
as
it
permits
a
university
to
consider
the
race
of
an
applicant
in
making
admissions
decisions.
i
do
not
agree
that
petitioner's
admissions
program
violates
the
constitution.
for
it
must
be
remembered
that,
during
most
of
the
past
200
years,
the
constitution,
as
interpreted
by
this
court,
did
not
prohibit
the
most
ingenious
and
pervasive
forms
of
discrimination
against
the
negro.
now,
when
a
state
acts
to
remedy
the
effects
of
that
legacy
of
discrimination,
i
cannot
believe
that
this
same
constitution
stands
as
a
barrier.
three
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago,
the
negro
was
dragged
to
this
country
in
chains
to
be
sold
into
slavery
and
the
system
of
slavery
brutalized
and
dehumanized
both
master
and
slave.
an
implicit
protection
of
slavery
was
embodied
in
the
declaration
of
independence
and
was
made
explicit
in
the
constitution.
the
individual
states
likewise
established
the
machinery
to
protect
the
system
of
slavery
through
the
promulgation
of
the
slave
codes,
which
were
designed
primarily
to
defend
the
property
interest
of
the
owner
and
his
slave.
the
position
of
the
negro
slave
as
mere
property
was
then
confirmed
by
this
court
in
dred
scott
against
sandford.
the
status
of
the
negro
as
property
was
officially
erased
by
his
emancipation
at
the
end
of
the
civil
war.
but
the
long-awaited
emancipation,
while
freeing
the
negro
from
slavery,
did
not
bring
him
citizenship
or
equality
in
any
meaningful
way.
despite
the
passage
of
the
thirteenth,
fourteenth,
and
fifteenth
amendments,
the
negro
was
systematically
denied
the
rights
that
those
amendments
were
supposed
to
secure.
the
combined
actions
and
inactions
of
the
state
and
federal
governments
maintained
negroes
in
a
position
of
legal
inferiority
for
another
century
after
the
civil
war.
the
southern
states
took
the
first
steps
and
immediately
following
the
end
of
the
civil
war,
many
of
the
provisional
legislatures
passed
black
codes,
similar
to
the
slave
codes,
which,
among
other
things,
limited
the
rights
of
a
negro
to
own
or
rent
property
and
permitted
imprisonment
for
breach
of
employment
contracts.
congress
responded
to
these
legal
disabilities
by
enacting
the
reconstruction
acts
and
the
civil
rights
acts.
thus
for
a
time
back
there,
it
seemed
as
if
the
negro
might
be
protected
from
the
continued
denial
of
his
civil
rights
and
might
be
relieved
of
the
disability
that
prevented
him
from
taking
his
rightful
place
as
a
free
and
equal
citizen.
that
time,
however,
was
short-lived.
reconstruction
came
to
a
close,
and,
with
the
assistance
of
this
court,
the
negro
was
rapidly
stripped
of
his
new
civil
rights.
the
court
began
by
interpreting
the
civil
war
amendments
in
a
manner
that
sharply
curtailed
their
substantive
protections.
then
in
the
notorious
civil
rights
cases,
the
court
strangled
congress'
efforts
to
use
its
power
to
promote
racial
equality.
the
court's
ultimate
blow
to
the
civil
war
amendments
and
to
the
equality
of
negroes
was
of
course,
plessy
against
ferguson.
in
upholding
that
louisiana
law,
they
said
that,
“equal
but
separate"
accommodations
for
whites
and
negroes.
the
court
held
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
not
intended
"to
abolish
distinctions
upon
color,
or
to
enforce
social,
as
distinguished
from
political
equality,
or
a
commingling
of
the
two
races
upon
terms
unsatisfactory
to
either."
ignoring
totally
the
realities
of
the
positions
of
the
two
races,
mr.
justice
harlan's
dissenting
opinion
recognized
the
bankruptcy
of
the
court's
reasoning.
he
expressed
his
fear
that
if
like
laws
were
enacted
in
other
states,
“the
effect
would
be
in
the
highest
degree
mischievous."
the
fears
of
mr.
justice
harlan
were
soon
to
be
realized.
in
the
wake
of
plessy,
many
states
began
expand
their
jim
crow
laws,
which
had
up
until
that
time
been
limited
primarily
to
passenger
trains
and
schools.
the
segregation
of
the
races
was
extended
to
residential
areas,
parks,
hospitals,
theaters,
waiting
rooms,
and
bathrooms,
you
name
it,
the
enforced
segregation
of
the
races
continued
into
the
middle
of
the
20th
century.
in
both
world
wars,
negroes
were
for
the
most
part
confined
to
separate
military
units.
it
was
not
until
1948
that
an
end
to
segregation
in
the
military
was
ordered
by
president
truman
and
the
history
of
the
exclusion
of
negro
children
from
white
public
schools
is
too
well
known
and
recent
to
require
repeating
here.
that
negroes
were
deliberately
excluded
from
public
graduate
and
professional
schools
and
thereby
denied
the
opportunity
to
become
doctors,
lawyers,
engineers,
and
the
like
is
too
well
established.
the
position
of
the
negro
today
in
america
is
a
tragic,
but
inevitable
consequence
of
centuries
of
unequal
treatment
measured
by
any
benchmark
of
comfort
or
achievement,
meaningful
equality
remains
a
distant
dream
for
the
negro.
a
negro
child
today
has
a
life
expectancy
which
is
shorter
by
more
than
five
years
than
of
a
white
child,
that's
today.
the
median
income
of
the
negro
family
is
only
60%
of
the
median
of
a
white
family,
and
the
percentage
of
negroes
who
live
in
families
with
incomes
below
the
poverty
line
is
nearly
four
times
greater
than
that
of
whites.
today,
when
the
negro
child
reaches
working
age,
he
finds
that
america
offers
him
significantly
less
than
it
offers
his
white
counterpart.
for
negro
adults,
the
unemployment
rate
is
twice
that
of
whites,
at
least
whites
and
the
unemployment
rate
for
negro
teenagers
is
three
to
four
times
that
of
white
teenagers,
i
am
talking
about
today.
the
relationship
between
those
figures
and
the
history
of
unequal
treatment
afforded
to
the
negro
cannot
be
denied
and
i
haven't
heard
it
denied.
at
every
point
from
birth
to
death,
the
impact
of
the
past
is
reelected
to
the
still
disfavored
position
of
the
negro.
in
light
of
the
sorry
history
of
discrimination
and
the
devastating
impact
on
the
lives
of
negroes,
bringing
the
negro
into
the
mainstream
of
american
life
should
be
a
state
interest
of
the
highest
order.
to
fail
to
do
so
is
to
ensure
that
america
will
remain
a
divided
society.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
requires
us
to
accept
that
fate.
neither
its
history
nor
our
past
cases
lend
support
to
the
conclusion
that
a
university
may
not
remedy
the
cumulative
effects
of
society's
discrimination
by
giving
consideration
to
race
in
an
effort
to
increase
the
number
and
percentage
of
negro
doctors
in
this
country.
the
experience
of
negroes
in
america
has
been
different
in
kind,
not
just
in
degree,
from
that
of
other
ethnic
groups.
it's
not
merely
the
history
of
slavery
alone,
but
also
that
a
whole
people
were
marked
as
inferior
by
the
law
and
that
mark
has
endured.
the
dream
of
america
as
great
melting
pot
has
not
been
realized
for
the
negro
because
of
his
skin
color,
he
never
even
made
it
into
the
pot.
these
differences
in
the
experience
of
the
negro
make
it
difficult
for
me
to
accept
that
negroes
cannot
be
afforded
greater
protection
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
where
it
is
necessary
to
remedy
the
effects
of
past
discrimination.
in
the
civil
rights
cases,
this
court
wrote
that
the
negro,
emerging
from
slavery
must
cease
"to
be
the
special
favorite
of
the
laws."
we
cannot
in
light
of
the
history
of
the
last
century
yield
to
that
view.
had
this
court
been
willing
in
1896,
in
plessy
and
ferguson
to
hold
that
the
equal
protection
clause
forbids
difference
in
treatment
based
on
race,
we
would
not
be
faced
with
this
dilemma
in
1978.
we
must
remember,
however,
that
the
principle
that
the
"constitution
is
color-blind"
appeared
only
in
the
dissenting
opinion.
the
majority
of
the
court
rejected
the
principle
of
color
blindness,
and
for
the
next
60
years,
from
plessy
to
board
of
education,
ours
was
a
nation
where,
by
law,
an
individual
could
be
given
"special"
treatment
based
on
the
color
of
his
skin.
it
is
because
of
a
legacy
of
unequal
treatment
that
we
now
must
permit
the
institutions
of
this
society
to
give
consideration
to
race
to
making
decisions
about
who
will
hold
the
positions
of
influence,
prestige
and
influence
in
america.
far
too
long,
the
doors
to
those
positions
have
been
shut
to
negroes.
if
we
are
ever
to
become
a
fully
integrated
society,
one
in
which
the
color
of
a
person's
skin
will
not
determine
the
opportunities
available
to
him,
we
must
be
willing
to
take
steps
to
open
those
doors.
i
do
not
believe
that
anyone
can
truly
look
into
america's
past
and
still
find
that
a
remedy
for
the
effects
of
that
past
is
impermissible.
it
has
been
said
that
this
case
involves
only
the
individual,
bakke
and
nobody
else
and
on
the
other
hand
it
says
it
only
involves
davis
university.
i
doubt,
however,
that
there
is
a
computer
capable
of
determining
the
number
of
persons
and
institutions
that
may
be
affected
by
the
decision
in
this
case
today.
for
example,
we
are
told
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
that
at
least
27
federal
agencies
have
adopted
regulations,
requiring
recipients
of
federal
funds
to
take
"affirmative
action
to
overcome
the
effects
of
conditions
which
resulted
in
limiting
participation
by
persons
of
a
particular
race,
color,
or
national
origin."
i
cannot
even
guess
the
number
of
state
and
local
governments
that
have
set
up
similar
affirmative-action
programs,
which
may
be
affected
by
today's
decision.
i
for
one,
fear
that
we
have
come
full
circle.
after
the
civil
war
our
government
started
several
"affirmative
action"
programs.
this
court
in
the
civil
rights
cases
and
plessy
against
ferguson
destroyed
the
movement
toward
complete
equality
through
affirmative
actions
and
then
for
almost
a
century,
no
action
was
taken
and
this
non-action
was
with
the
tacit
approval
of
the
courts.
then
we
had
brown
versus
eduction
and
the
congressional
civil
rights
act
followed
by
numerous
affirmative-action
programs.
but
now
today,
we
have
this
court
again
stepping
in
this
time
to
stop
affirmative-action
program
of
the
type
used
by
the
university
of
california
in
doing
so
i
cannot
go
along.
