mr.

is
there
something
in
the
record
indicating
who
--
who
proposed
or
adopted
the
task
force
program?
justice
lewis

but
he
wasn't
--
he
wasn't
there
then,
was
he?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,

is
there
anything
in
the
record
indicating
the
approval
of
the
regents
other
than
the
fact
they're
defendant
–
they
are

--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
thank
you.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
agree
then
that
there
was
a
quota
of
84?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
now,
the
question
is
not
whether
the
16
is
a
quota.
the
question
is
whether
the
84
is
a
quota?
what
is
the
answer
to
that?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
then
why
not?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
cox,
along
the
same
line
of
discussion,
would
you
relate
the
number
in
any
way
to
the
population
and
if
so,
the
population
of
the
nation,
the
state,
the
city
or
to
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
23%
i
think
of
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
cox,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
of
the
trial
court
found
a
violation
of
title
vi
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act.
do
you
think
we
have
to
consider
the
title
vi
question
before
getting
to
the
constitutional
question?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
think
it's
not
before
the
court
even
though
the
trial
court
made
a
finding?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
two
of
the
amicus
argued
--
two
of
the
amicus
argue
the
title
vi
--
title
vi
question
you
know.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
think
is
it
necessary
when
a
ruling
one
way
would
support
the
judgment
below?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
couldn't
the
respondent
–
couldn't
the
respondent
urge
it
to
support
the
judgment?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
in
mr.
justice
rehnquist
example,
he
was
assuming
precisely
the
same
motivation
that
is
present
in
this
case,
the
desire
to
increase
the
number
of
black
in
minority
doctors
and
the
desire
to
increase
the
mixture
the
student
population.
why
would
not
--
not
that
justify
the
50?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
mr.
solicitor
general,
do
you
agree
with
mr.
cox
that
the
we
ought
not
to
address
the
title
vi
question?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
that
goes
to
the
merits.
should
we
or
should
we
not
address
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
of
course
he
may
--
he
may
still
urge
it.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
there's
no
--
no
controversy
between
counsel
as
to
the
existence
of
the
plan
or
as
kind
to
those
or
what
it
provided,
is
there?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
is
it
a
factual
controversy
or
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes,
but
mr.
colvin,
you
do
not
dispute
the
basic
finding
that
everybody
admitted
under
the
special
program
was
qualified.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
they
chose
the
2.5
figure
because
they
felt
that
anyone
with
a
lesser
score
would
not
be
qualified
either
to
do
the
academic
work
or
to
practice
medicine.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes,
it
was
an
administrative
basis.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well
then,
but
how
does
that
go
--
why
do
you
disagree
with
the
proposition
that
there's
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
that
any
of
the
special
people
were
qualified
to
study
and
to
practice.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
a
question
that
i
think
is
relevant
to
your
last
statement.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
case
before
us
involves
essentially
a
two-track
admission
system
with
separate
committees.
let's
assume
you
have
a
university,
a
medical
school
with
a
single
admission
committee
and
with
no
allocation
of
seats
to
any
particular
ethnic
or
other
group
of
applicants
but
that
it
had
a
long
list
of
factors
or
elements
that
the
admissions
committee
fairly
considered
and
assumed
further
that
race
and
sex
and
geographical
location
and
economic
background
and
urban-rural
and
all
of
the
other
factors
that
academicians
do
consider
in
admitting
people
at
the
college
and
to
professional
schools.
assume
that
type
of
system
and
further
assume
that
your
client
had
not
been
admitted,
would
your
argument
be
the
same
that
the
constitutional
matter?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
my
hypothetical
listed
race
as
one
of
eight
or
ten
factors
or
elements
that
a
committee
might
fairly
waive
in
the
interest
of
diversity
of
the
student
body
for
example.
would
that
be
unconstitutional
in
your
opinion?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
cox,
before
you
commence
your
argument,
may
i
inquire
whether
you
agree
with
my
understanding
of
the
solicitor
general's
position
that
it
is
--
the
record
is
inadequate
for
the
constitutional
decision
and
should
be
remanded?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
as
the
chief
justice
has
stated,
i
am
authorized
to
announce
only
the
judgment
of
the
court.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
too
well
known
to
be
re-stated
this
morning.
perhaps
no
case
in
modern
memory
has
received
as
much
media
coverage
and
scholarly
commentary.
more
than
60
briefs
were
filed
with
the
court.
we
also
have
received
the
advice
through
the
media
and
the
commentaries
of
countless
extra
judicial
advocates.
the
case
was
argued
some
eight
months
ago
and
as
we
speak
today
with
a
notable
lack
of
unanimity,
it
maybe
fair
to
say
that
we
needed
all
of
this
advice.
in
any
event,
it
will
be
evident
from
the
several
opinions
that
the
case
intrinsically
difficult,
has
received
our
most
thoughtful
attention
over
many
months.
so
much
for
the
introduction;
as
there
are
six
separate
opinions,
i
will
state
first
the
court's
judgment.
insofar,
as
the
california
supreme
court
held
at
bakke
must
be
admitted
to
the
davis
medical
school,
we
affirm.
insofar,
as
the
california
court
prohibited
davis
from
considering
race
as
a
factor
in
admissions,
we
reverse.
i
will
now
try
to
explain
how
we
divided
on
these
issues.
this
may
not
be
self
evident
from
a
hard
examination
of
our
various
opinions.
the
decision
of
the
california
court
presented
us
with
two
central
questions;
the
first
and
the
one
widely
perceived
as
the
only
ultimate
question
is
whether
the
special
admissions
program
discriminated
unlawfully
against
bakke
either
under
the
constitution
or
under
title
vi
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
i
will
refer
to
this
as
bakke
admissions
question.
the
second
and
broader
question
is
whether
it
is
ever
permissible
to
consider
race
as
a
factor
relevant
to
the
admission
of
applicants
to
a
state
university.
i
will
refer
to
this
question
generally
as
whether
race
maybe
considered.
as
will
be
perceived
at
this
point,
if
the
answer
to
the
second
question
were
negative,
that
is
that
race
may
never
validly
considered,
this
answer
disposes
of
both
issues.
bakke
would
be
admitted
and
the
university
could
not
in
the
future,
give
any
consideration
to
race
in
its
admissions
program.
if
however,
the
second
question
were
answered
affirmatively,
that
is
that
race
maybe
considered,
then
it
becomes
necessarily
to
address
the
first
question
separately
that
is
whether
the
“special
admissions
program”
at
davis
is
compatible
with
title
vi
and
with
the
constitution.
i
have
mentioned
both
title
vi,
often
referred
to
as
a
statutory
issue
and
the
constitution
under
which
is
presented
the
equal
protection
issue
arising
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
case
is
further
complicated
because
if
it
were
disposed
of
under
title
vi,
there
would
be
no
occasions
to
reach
the
constitutional
issues.
i
will
now
state
more
specifically
how
the
questions
are
decided.
the
chief
justice
and
justices
stewart,
rehnquist
and
stevens
in
an
opinion
authorized
by
mr.
justice
stevens
have
concluded
that
the
only
question
before
us
is
whether
bakke
was
unlawfully
excluded
from
the
medical
school
because
of
his
race.
in
their
view,
congress
has
answered
that
question
in
title
vi.
they
would
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
california
court
without
addressing
the
question
whether
race
maybe
ever
be
considered
as
a
factor
in
an
admissions
program.
justices
brennan,
white,
marshall,
blackmun
and
i
have
a
different
view
as
to
title
vi.
we
believe
despite
smaller
and
detailed
provisions
that
it
goes
no
further
in
prohibiting
the
use
of
race
than
the
equal
protection
clause.
the
five
of
us
therefore,
reach
both
of
the
constitutional
questions.
on
a
constitutional
analysis,
founded
on
the
equal
protection
clause,
justices
brennan,
white,
marshall
and
blackmun,
in
that
joint
opinion,
hold,
not
only
that
race
properly
maybe
considered
but
also
that
the
special
admissions
program
of
the
davis
medical
school
is
valid
in
every
respect.
when
i
have
concluded,
mr.
justice
brennan
will
state
this
position
more
fully.
mr.
justice
marshall
and
mr.
justice
blackmun
also
will
make
statements.
as
i
agree
that
title
vi
does
not
dispose
of
this
case,
i
also
address
the
constitutional
question.
on
the
first
of
these,
whether
the
special
admissions
program
is
invalid,
i
agree
with
the
result
reached
by
mr.
justice
stevens'
opinion,
but
i
do
so
on
constitutional
grounds
rather
than
on
under
title
vi.
thus
there
are
five
votes
to
affirm
the
judgment,
invalidating
the
“special”
program.
under
this
judgment,
bakke
will
be
admitted
to
the
medical
school.
as
to
the
second
constitutional
issue,
whether
race
may
be
considered
as
a
factor
in
an
admissions
program,
i
agree
with
the
result
reached
by
the
joint
opinion
of
mr.
justice
brennan
and
my
brothers
who
have
joined
him.
thus,
there
are
five
justices
who
join
in
a
judgment
of
reversal
on
this
issue,
but
the
process
of
constitutional
analysis
by
which
i
reach
this
result
differs
significantly
from
that
of
the
four
justices
who
have
filed
a
joint
opinion.
as
my
reasoning
is
set
forth
fully
in
my
written
opinion,
and
as
other
justices
will
speak,
i
will
merely
make
a
brief
conclusory
summary.
the
davis
“special
admissions”
program
with
sixteen
of
100
seats
reserved
exclusively
for
three
categories
of
minorities,
is
a
classification
based
on
race.
our
cases
establish
beyond
question
that
a
racial
classification
by
a
state
agency
is
inherently
suspect
and
must
be
subjected
to
the
most
exacting
judicial
scrutiny.
although
adopted
primarily
to
protect
persons
of
the
negro
race,
the
guarantee
of
the
equal
protection
clause
by
its
terms
protects
all
persons.
it
provides
explicitly
that
no
person
shall
be
denied
equal
protection
of
the
law.
despite
this
absolute
language,
our
cases
have
held
at
some
distinction
are
justified
if
necessary
to
further
a
compelling
state
interest.
davis
relies
on
several
interests
thought
to
be
compelling.
one
is
the
desire
to
readdress
racial
imbalance
said
to
result
from
general
societal
discrimination
against
the
minority
groups
selected
for
preferential
treatment.
but
there
is
a
complete
absence
on
this
record
of
any
finding
that
this
imbalance
is
traceable
to
discriminatory
practices.
discrimination
by
society
at
large,
with
no
determined
effects,
is
not
sufficient
to
justify
petitioner's
racial
classification.
in
my
view,
the
only
state
interest
that
fairly
may
be
viewed
as
compelling
on
this
record
is
the
interest
of
a
university
in
a
diverse
student
body.
this
interest,
encompassed
within
the
concept
of
academic
freedom,
is
a
special
concern
of
the
first
amendment,
but
there
has
been
no
showing
in
this
case
that
the
davis
“special”
program
is
necessary
to
achieve
educational
diversity.
the
davis
program
totally
excludes
all
applicants
who
are
not
negro,
asian
or
chicano
from
16
of
the
100
seats
in
an
entering
class.
no
matter
how
strong
their
qualifications,
qualitative
and
quantitative,
including
their
own
potential
for
contributing
to
educational
diversity,
they
are
not
afforded
the
opportunity
to
compete
with
the
applicants
from
the
preferred
groups
for
those
sixteen
seats.
at
the
same
time,
the
preferred
applicants
have
the
opportunity
to
compete
for
every
seat
in
the
class.
a
university's
interest
in
a
a
diverse
student
body
is
not
limited
to
ethnic
diversity.
rather
it's
compelling
interest
in
this
respect
encompasses
a
far
broader
array
of
qualifications
and
characteristics
of
which
race
is
only
one.
i
refer
in
my
opinion
to
the
harvard
admissions
program
as
one
example
of
how
race
properly,
in
my
opinion,
maybe
taken
into
account.
i
will
quote
briefly
from
the
description
of
the
harvard
program,
a
copy
of
which
is
in
the
appendix
to
my
opinion
and
here
i
quote
in
substance,
“the
admission
committee
has
not
set
target-quotas
for
the
number
of
blacks,
or
of
musicians,
football
players,
physicists
or
californians
to
be
admitted
in
a
given
year.
awareness
of
the
need
for
a
diversity
means
only
that
in
choosing
among
thousands
of
academically
qualified
applicants,
the
committee,
with
a
number
of
criteria
in
mind,
pays
some
attention
to
distribution
that
should
be
made
among
many
types
and
categories
of
students.
"thus
race
is
considered
in
a
flexible
program
designed
to
achieve
diversity,
but
it
is
only
one
factor
weighed
competitively
against
a
number
of
other
factors
being
relevant.
under
such
a
system,
each
applicant
is
treated
as
an
individual,
regardless
of
race
and
is
considered
in
competition
for
each
seat
in
the
class.
as
the
briefs
in
this
case,
and
the
literature
in
this
area,
abundantly
illustrate
many
of
our
finest
universities
and
colleges
peruse
a
flexible,
competitive
admissions
program
in
which
race
maybe
considered
as
a
relevant
factor.
this
experience
demonstrates
that
the
davis
type
program,
one
that
arbitrarily
forecloses
all
competition
solely
on
the
basis
of
race
or
ethnic
origin,
is
not
necessary
to
attain
reasonable
educational
diversity.
in
my
view,
it
therefore
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
in
the
most
fundamental
sense.
yet,
the
way
is
open
to
davis
to
adopt
the
type
of
admissions
program,
proved
to
be
successful
in
so
many
of
the
universities
and
colleges
of
our
country.
