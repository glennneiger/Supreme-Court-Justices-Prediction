well
we
can't
--
obviously,
we
can't

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
asking
you
then
yes
or
no.
do
you
want
us
to
decide
the
state
and
federal
constitutional
ground?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
ordinarily,
we
don't
decide
constitutional
questions
if
we
can
affirm
which
is
what
you
ask
us
to
do
on
a
federal
statutory
ground.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
all
you're
asking
us
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
my
brother
powell
has
already
said,
mr.
justice
white,
mr.
justice
marshall,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
and
i
have
filed
a
jointly
signed
opinion
supporting
our
views
that
the
judgment
of
the
california
supreme
court
should
be
reserved
in
all
respects.
not
only
insofar
as
it
prohibits
the
university
from
establishing
“race
conscious
programs
in
the
future,”
but
also
insofar
as
the
judgment
orders
that
respondent
bakke
be
admitted
to
the
davis
medical
school.
as
is
apparent
from
the
statements
of
both
my
brother
powell
and
my
brother
stevens,
all
nine
members
of
the
court
addressed
the
threshold
question
of
statutory
construction
and
a
majority,
consisting
of
mr.
justice
powell
and
the
four
of
us,
construe
the
statute
as
going
no
further
in
prohibiting
the
use
of
race
then
the
equal
protection
clause
itself.
now
that
then
is
a
law
of
statutory
construction
for
the
purposes
of
this
case.
although
it
may
strike
some
as
unusual,
that
the
dissenters
in
that
construction
rests
their
affirmance
of
the
california
supreme
court
on
their
construction
of
title
vi,
that
is
not
the
law,
having
being
rejected
by
a
majority
of
the
court.
the
dissenters
have
chosen
not
to
address
the
constitutional
question
required
by
the
majority's
controlling
construction
namely
whether
the
davis
program
violates
the
equal
protection
clause.
our
brother
powell,
as
he
said,
also
affirms
the
california
supreme
court
insofar,
it
directed
bakke's
admission
but
on
the
ground,
even
though
i
know
i
am
repeating
i
think
it's
important
that
it
be
emphasized,
reaching
the
constitution,
davis's
special
admission
program
was
unnecessary
in
his
view
to
the
achievement
of
the
compelling
goal
of
achieving
a
diverse
student
body.
so
in
consequence,
only
five
members
of
the
court
addressed
the
constitutional
question
of
uniquely
paramount
importance
that
this
case
presents,
what
race
conscious
programs
are
permissible
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
although
it's
no
secret
that
the
court
took
this
case
as
the
vehicle
for
confronting
that
issue
after
avoiding
it
on
mootness
grounds
in
the
defunis
case.
but
the
fact
that
only
five
of
us
addressed
the
constitutional
question
must
not
obscure
the
signal
importance
of
today's
decision
on
the
constitutional
question.
five
of
us,
a
court
majority,
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
california
supreme
court
insofar
as
it
prohibits
davis
from
establishing
race
conscious
admissions
programs
in
the
future.
thus
the
central
meaning
of
today's
opinions
is
this.
government
may
take
race
into
account
when
it
acts
not
to
demean
or
insult
any
racial
group,
but
to
remedy
disadvantages
cast
on
minorities
by
past
racial
prejudice,
at
least
when
appropriate
findings
have
been
made
by
judicial,
legislative
or
administrative
bodies
with
competence
to
act
in
this
area.
now
the
opinion
of
the
four
of
us,
is
some
55
printed
pages
and
of
course,
i
shall
only
briefly
touch
up
it's
highlights.
the
first
half
addresses
the
threshold
question
of
the
construction
of
title
vi.
although
the
dissenters
have
that
there
is
a
private
right
of
action
under
title
vi,
three
of
the
four
of
us
agree
with
our
brother
powell
that
this
case
doesn't
require
us
to
decide
that
question.
our
brother
white
however,
believes
we
should
address
it
and
accordingly
he
has
filed
a
separate
opinion
stating
his
view
that
there
is
no
private
right
of
action
under
title
vi.
the
rest
of
our
statutory
construction
discussion
canvases
in
great
detail
the
legislative
history
that
contrary
to
the
view
just
expressed
by
my
brother
stevens
in
our
view
establishes
beyond
question
that
title
vi
was
not
indented
to
bar
state
affirmative
action
programs
not
bared
by
the
equal
protection
clause
itself.
in
other
words,
the
legislative
history
contrary
to
the
dissenters
reading,
provides
no
support
for
the
proposition
that
congress
intended
to
impose
statutory
limitations
upon
constitutionally
permissible
racial
preferences
designed
to
extend
the
benefits
of
federally
financed
programs
to
racial
minorities
that
historically
have
been
excluded
from
the
full
benefits
of
american
life
as
a
result
of
racial
discrimination.
in
sum,
in
our
brother
powell's
words
and
his
opinion
and
i
quote
them,
“
in
view
of
the
clear
legislative
intent,
title
vi
must
be
held
to
proscribe
only
those
racial
classifications
that
would
violate
the
equal
protection
clause
or
the
fifth
amendment.”
our
discussion
of
the
constitutional
question,
takes
up
the
second
half
of
our
opinion.
it
opens
with
a
history
of
our
national
betrayal
of
our
founding
principle
that
all
men
are
created
equal,
for
candor
requires
acknowledgment
that
the
framers
of
our
constitution,
to
forge
the
13
colonies
into
one
nation,
openly
compromised
this
principle
of
equality
with
its
antithesis
slavery.
the
consequences
of
this
compromise
are
well
known.
they
have
have
aptly
been
called
our
'american
dilemma'.
thus
we
think
it
well
to
recount
how
brief
the
time
has
been
if
it
has
yet
come,
when
the
promise
of
our
principles
has
flowered
into
the
actuality
of
equal
opportunity
for
all
regardless
of
race
or
color.
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
embodiment
in
the
constitution
of
our
abiding
belief
in
human
equality,
has
been
the
law
of
our
land
for
only
slightly
more
than
half
of
our
200
years
as
a
nation.
and
for
half
of
that
half,
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
amendment
was
largely
moribund.
worst
the
clause
was
only
turned
against
those
whom
it
was
intended
to
set
free,
condemning
them
to
a
"separate
but
equal"
status
before
the
law,
a
status
always
separate,
but
seldom
equal.
not
until
1954,
only
24
years
ago,
was
this
odious
doctrine
interred
by
our
decision
in
brown
v.
board
of
education.
brown
i,
and
its
progeny
which
proclaimed
that
separate
schools
and
public
facilities
of
all
sorts
were
inherently
unequal
and
forbidden
under
our
constitution.
even
then,
inequality
was
not
eliminated
with
"all
deliberate
speed."
in
1968
and
again
in
1971
we
were
forced
to
remind
school
boards
of
their
obligation
to
eliminate
racial
discrimination
root
and
branch.
and
a
glance
at
our
docket
and
those
of
lower
courts
even
today
will
show
that
officially
sanctioned
discrimination
is
not
a
thing
of
the
past.
against
this
background,
claims
that
law
must
be
"colorblind"
or
that
the
datum
of
race
is
no
longer
relevant
to
public
policy
must
be
seen
as
aspiration,
rather
than
as
descriptive
of
reality.
this
is
not
to
denigrate
aspiration,
but
for
reality
rebukes
us
that
race
has
too
often
been
used
by
those
who
would
stigmatize
and
oppress
minorities.
yet
we
cannot
and
as
our
opinion
attempts
to
demonstrate
need
not,
under
our
constitution,
let
color
blindness
become
myopia
which
masks
the
reality
that
many
"created
equal"
have
been
treated
within
our
lifetimes
as
inferior
both
by
the
law
and
by
their
fellow
citizens.
the
association
of
human
equality
is
closely
associated
with
a
proposition
that
differences
in
color
or
creed,
birth
or
status,
are
neither
significant
nor
relevant
to
the
way
in
which
persons
should
be
treated.
nonetheless,
the
position
that
such
factors
must
be
constitutionally
in
relevance,
summed
up
by
the
short
hand
phrase
or
if
constitution
is
colorblind
has
never
been
adopted
by
this
court
as
the
proper
meaning
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
our
opinions
cites
numerous
decisions
of
this
court.
school
desegregation
cases,
gender
discrimination
cases,
decisions
sustaining
affirmative
action
programs
of
the
congress
and
federal
agencies
supporting
the
conclusion
that
nothing
whatever
in
the
history
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
the
civil
rights
acts,
even
remotely
suggests
that
the
states
are
foreclosed
from
furthering
the
fundamental
purpose
of
equal
opportunity
to
which
the
amendment
and
these
acts
are
addressed.
our
opinion
next
turns
to
the
problem
of
what
the
judicial
role
should
be
in
reviewing
state
action
that
expressly
classifies
by
race
for
remedial
purposes
as
does
the
davis
program.
respondent
bakke
argues
that
racial
classifications
are
always
suspect
and
consequently,
that
this
court
should
weigh
the
importance
of
the
objective
served
by
davis's
affirmative
admission
program
to
see
if
they
are
compelling.
in
addition,
he
asserts
this
court
must
inquire
whether
in
it's
judgment
there
are
alternatives
other
than
racial
classifications
which
would
suit
davis'
purposes.
the
university
on
the
other
hand,
states
that
our
proper
role
is
simply
to
accept
its
determination
that
the
racial
classifications
used
by
its
program
are
reasonably
related
to
what
it
tells
us
are
its
benign
purposes.
our
opinion
adopts
a
standard
somewhere
in
between.
because
of
the
significant
risk
that
racial
classifications
established
for
ostensibly
benign
purposes
can
be
misused,
causing
effects
not
unlike
those
created
by
invidious
classifications,
it
is
inappropriate
to
inquire
only
whether
there
is
any
conceivable
basis
that
might
sustain
such
a
classification.
rather
to
justify
such
a
classification,
an
important
and
articulated
purpose
for
its
use
must
be
shown.
in
addition,
any
statute
must
be
stricken
that
stigmatizes
any
group
or
that
singles
out
those
least
well
represented
in
the
political
process
to
bear
the
brunt
of
a
benign
program.
thus,
our
review
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
should
be
strict,
not
"strict'
in
theory
and
fatal
in
fact"
because
it
is
stigma
that
causes
fatality,
but
strict
and
searching
nonetheless.
the
opinion
next
analyses
the
davis
problem
by
that
standard
and
concludes
that
it
passes
constitutional
muster
as
a
permissible
program
to
remove
the
disparate
racial
impact
it's
admissions
program
might
otherwise
have
and
was
adopted
on
the
basis
of
the
reasonable
belief
that
the
disparate
discrete
impact
is
itself
a
product
of
past
discrimination
whether
the
universities
or
that
of
society
at
large.
it's
not
claimed
that
the
davis
program
operates
to
stigmatize
or
single
out
any
discrete
and
insular,
or
even
any
identifiable,
non-minority
group.
bakke
was
not
in
any
sense
stamped
as
inferior
by
the
medical
school's
rejection
of
him.
indeed,
it
is
conceded
by
all
that
he
satisfied
those
criteria
regarded
by
the
school
as
generally
relevant
to
academic
performance
better
than
most
of
the
minority
members
who
were
admitted.
in
addition
there
is
simply
no
evidence
that
the
davis
program
discriminates
intentionally
or
unintentionally
against
any
minority
group
which
it
purports
to
benefit.
the
program
does
not
establish
a
quota
in
the
invidious
sense
of
a
ceiling
on
the
number
of
minority
applicants
to
be
admitted
nor
can
the
program
reasonably
be
regarded
as
stigmatizing
the
program's
beneficiaries
or
their
race
as
inferior.
it's
uncontested
that
davis
admits
only
those
minority
applicants
in
the
special
program
who
are
fully
qualified
to
study
medicine.
once
admitted,
these
students
must
satisfy
the
same
degree
requirements
as
regularly
admitted
students.
they
are
taught
by
the
same
faculty
in
the
same
classes
and
their
performance
is
evaluated
by
the
same
standards
by
which
regularly
admitted
students
are
judged.
under
these
circumstances,
their
performance
and
degrees
must
be
regarded
equally
with
the
regularly
admitted
students
with
whom
they
compete
or
standing.
our
opinion
finally
comes
to
our
reasons
for
disagreeing
that
the
set
aside
those
16
places
under
the
davis
program
requires
the
conclusion
that
bakke
was
unconstitutionally
denied
admission.
davis's
special
admissions
program
cannot
in
our
view,
be
said
to
violate
the
constitution
simply
because
it
has
set
aside
a
predetermined
number
of
places
for
qualified
minority
applicants,
rather
than,
as
thus
the
harvard
program
approved
by
our
brother
powell,
using
race
as
positive
factor
to
be
considered
in
evaluating
the
applications
of
disadvantaged
minority
applicants.
we
think
that
for
purposes
of
constitutional
adjudication,
there
is
simply,
no
difference
between
the
two
approaches.
it's
inescapable
that
in
any
admissions
program
which
extends
the
preference
to
disadvantaged
racial
minorities,
a
decision
must
be
made
as
to
how
much
of
a
preferences
is
to
be
given
and
any
given
preference
that
results
in
the
exclusion
of
a
white
candidate
is
no
more
or
less
constitutionally
acceptable
than
a
program
such
as
that
at
davis.
furthermore,
the
extent
of
the
preference
inevitably
depends
on
how
many
minority
applicants
the
particular
school
is
seeking
to
admit
in
any
particular
year.
there
is
no
sensible,
and
certainly
no
constitutional
distinction
as
we
see,
between,
for
example,
adding
a
set
number
of
points
to
the
admissions
rating
of
disadvantaged
minority
applicants
as
an
expression
of
the
preference
with
the
expectation
that
this
will
result
in
the
admission
of
an
approximately
determined
number
of
qualified
minority
applicants
and
setting
a
fixed
number
of
places
for
such
qualified
applicants,
as
was
done
here.
a
"harvard"
program
as
those
employing
it
readily
concede,
openly
and
successfully
employs
a
racial
criterion
for
the
purpose
of
ensuring
that
some
of
the
scarce
places
in
institutions
of
higher
education
are
allocated
to
disadvantaged
minority
students.
that
the
harvard
approach
does
not
also
make
public
the
extent
of
the
preference
and
the
precise
workings
of
the
system,
while
the
davis
program
employs
a
specific,
openly
stated
number,
does
not,
in
our
view,
condemn
the
latter
plan
for
purposes
of
fourteenth
amendment.
it
may
be
that
the
harvard
plan
is
more
acceptable
to
the
public
generally
than
is
the
davis
"quota."
if
it
is,
any
state,
including
california,
is
free
to
adopt
it
in
preference
to
a
less
acceptable
alternative,
just
as
it
is
generally
free,
as
far
as
the
constitution
is
concerned,
to
abjure
granting
any
racial
preferences
in
its
admissions
programs.
but
there
is
no
basis
for
preferring
a
particular
preference
program
simply
because
in
achieving
the
same
goals
that
the
davis
medical
school
is
pursuing,
it
proceeds
in
a
manner
that
is
not
immediately
apparent
to
the
public.
