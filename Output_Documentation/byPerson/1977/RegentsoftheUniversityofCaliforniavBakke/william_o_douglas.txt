justice
william
o.
douglas
mr.
colvin,
may
i
follow
up
on
justice
white's
observation.
certainly
as
i
view
this
record,
the
university
doesn't
deny
or
dispute
the
basic
facts,
they
are
perfectly
clear.
we
are
here,
at
least
i'm
here
primarily
that
to
hear
our
constitutional
argument,
you
devoted
20
minutes
belaboring
of
facts,
if
i
may
say
so.
i
would
like
to
help.
i
really
would
on
the
constitutional
issue.
could
you
address
that
please?
