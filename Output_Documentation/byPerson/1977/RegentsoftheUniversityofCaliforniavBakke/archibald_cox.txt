mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
here
on
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
california
presents
a
single
vital
question.
whether
the
state
--
whether
a
state
university
which
is
forced
by
limited
resources
to
select
a
relatively
smaller
number
of
students
from
a
much
larger
number
of
well-qualified
applicants
is
free
voluntarily
to
take
into
account
the
fact
that
a
qualified
applicant
is
black,
chicano,
or
asian,
or
native
american
in
order
to
increase
the
number
of
qualified
members
of
those
minority
groups
trained
for
the
educated
professions
and
participating
individual,
professions
from
which
minorities
were
long
excluded
because
of
generations
of
pervasive
racial
discrimination.
the
answer
which
the
court
gives
was
determined
perhaps
for
decades
whether
members
of
those
minorities
are
to
have
the
kind
of
meaningful
access
to
higher
education
in
the
profession
which
the
universities
have
accorded
them
in
recent
years
ought
are
to
be
reduced
to
the
trivial
numbers
which
they
were
prior
to
the
adoption
of
minority
admissions
programs.
the
three
facts
realities
which
dominated
the
situation
that
the
medical
school
of
davis
had
before
it
and
which
i
think
this
control
the
decision
of
this
court.
the
first
is
that
the
number
of
qualified
applicants
for
the
nation's
professional
schools
is
vastly
greater
than
the
number
of
places
available.
that
is
a
fact
and
an
inescapable
fact.
in
1975,
1976,
for
example,
there
were
roughly
30,000
qualified
applicants
for
admission
to
medical
school,
a
much
greater
number
of
actual
applicants
and
there
were
only
about
14,000
places.
at
davis,
there
were
25
applicants
have
received
in
1973.
in
1974,
the
ratio
was
risen
to
37
to
1.
so
the
problem
is
one
of
selection
among
qualified
applicants,
not
of
ability
to
gain
from
a
professional
education.
the
second
fact
which
is
no
need
for
me
to
elaborate
but
it
is
a
fact
for
generation's
racial
discrimination
in
the
united
states,
much
of
it
stimulated
by
unconstitutional
state
action.
isolated
certain
minorities
condemn
them
to
unfairer
education
and
shut
them
out
of
the
most
important
and
satisfying
aspects
of
american
life
including
higher
education
and
the
profession.
and
the
greatest
problem
is
the
carnegie
on
higher
education
noted
more
than
10
years
ago.
the
greatest
problem
in
achieving
racial
justice
was
to
draw
those
minorities
into
the
professions
that
place
on
important
part
in
our
national
life.
and
then
there's
one
third
factor.
there
is
no
racially
blind
method
of
selection
which
will
enroll
today
more
than
a
trickle
of
minority
students
in
the
nation's
colleges
and
professions.
these
are
the
realities
which
the
university
of
california,
davis
medical
school
faced
in
1968.
in
which
i
say
i
think
the
court
must
face
when
it
comes
to
its
decision.
until
1969,
the
applicants
of
davis
as
it
most
of
the
medical
schools
were
chosen
on
the
basis
of
scores
on
the
medical
aptitude
test,
their
college
grades,
and
other
personal
experiences
and
qualifications
as
revealed
in
the
application.
the
process
excluded
virtually
almost
all
members
of
minority
groups.
even
when
they
were
fully
qualified
for
places
because
there
scores
by
enlarge
were
lower
on
the
cognitive
test
and
in
college
grade
point
averages.
alright,
there
were
no
black
students
and
no
chicanos
in
the
class
entering
davis
in
1968.
if
one
puts
to
one
side
the
predominately
black
medical
schools,
howard
and
meharry
lasted
off
1%,
eight-tenths
of
1%
of
all
medical
students
in
the
united
states
were
black
in
the
year
1968,
1969.
in
1969,
the
faculty
at
davis
concluded
the
drawing
in
the
medical
college,
qualified
members
of
minorities,
minorities
long
victimized
by
racial
discrimination
would
yield
important
educational
professional
and
social
benefits.
it
then
chose
one
variant
of
the
only
possible
method
of
increasing
number.
it
established
what
came
to
be
known
as
the
task
force
program
following
the
name
of
then
program
established
by
the
association
of
american
medical
colleges,
which
would
select
there
were
only
50
in
the
entering
class
at
that
time,
which
would
select
eight
educationally
but
fully
qualified
--
select
eight
educationally
or
economically
disadvantaged
but
fully
qualified
minority
students
for
inclusion
among
the
52
in
the
entering
class.
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
indicated
then
it
was
adopted
by
the
faculty
in
the
school.
it
was
voted
by
the
faculty.
that
appears
from
dean
lowrey's
testimony
and
it
also
appeared
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
i
guess
he
must
have
learned
when
he
came
somewhat
later.
there's
nothing
--
there
nothing
more
than
his
testimony
gained
and
--
i
may
say,
i
have
seen
the
minutes
but
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
because
the
regents
had
delegated
to
each
faculty
of
each
school,
the
responsibility
for
admissions.
mr.
archibald
cox
so,
this
was
left
to
the
different
colleges
and
very
wisely,
i
think
because
autonomous
institutions,
each
trying
to
solve
this
problem
in
their
own
way.
you
may
give
all
of
us
the
benefit
of
the
experience
trial
and
error,
creativity.
that's
the
virtue
of
not
constitutionalizing
the
problems
in
this
kind.
the
number
was
increased
to
16
when
the
size
of
the
class
was
increased
to
a
100.
and
it
was
the
--
this
step
was
taken
as
part
of
the
movement
led
by
the
association
of
american
medical
colleges
which
brought
the
number
of
black
students
studying
at
predominantly
white
medical
schools
from
less
than
1%
to
more
than
5%,
from
211
to
3,000
in
a
period
of
10
years.
i
want
to
emphasize
that
the
designation
in
16
places
was
not
a
quota
at
least
as
i
review
is
that
were.
certainly
it
was
not
a
quota
in
the
older
sense
of
an
arbitrary
limit
put
on
the
number
of
members
of
the
non-popular
group
who
would
be
the
admitted
to
an
institution
which
was
looking
down
its
nose
at.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
that
it
limited
the
number
of
non-minority
and
therefore
essentially
white,
yes,
but
there
two
things
to
be
said
about
that.
one
is
that
this
was
not
pointing
the
finger
at
a
group
which
had
been
marked
as
inferior
in
any
sense
and
it
was
undifferentiated
that
operated
against
a
wide
variety
of
people.
so
i
think
it
was
not
stigmatizing
in
the
sense
the
(inaudible)
was
stigmatizing
in
any
way.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
sorry.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
did
put
a
limit.
no
question
about
that
and
i
don't
mean
to
evade
that
and
i
direct
myself
to
it
a
little
later
if
i
may?
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
deny
that
it
was
the
quota.
we
agree
that
there
were
16
places
set
aside
before
qualified
disadvantaged
minority
student.
now,
if
that
number
--
if
setting
aside
the
number,
the
amount
of
result
of
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
say
--
i
would
say
that
neither
is
properly
defined
as
a
quota.
mr.
archibald
cox
because
in
the
first
place
--
because
of
my
understanding
in
the
meaning
of
quota
and
i
think
the
decisive
things
are
the
facts.
and
the
operative
facts
are
this
is
not
something
imposed
from
outside
as
the
quotas
are
in
the
employment
or
the
targets
are
unemployment
sometime
today.
it
was
not
a
limit
on
the
number
of
minority
students.
other
minority
students
were
in
fact
accepted
for
the
regular
admissions
program.
it
was
not
a
guarantee
of
a
minimum
number
of
minority
student
because
all
of
them
had
to
pay
him
the
testimony
is
that
all
of
them
were
fully
qualified,
alright.
it
did
say
that
if
there
are
16
qualified
minority
students
and
were
also
disadvantage.
then
16
places
shall
be
failed
by
them
and
only
84
places
will
be
available
to
others.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
so
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
i
was
--
i
quite
agree
with
mr.
justice.
i
was
trying
to
emphasize
that
the
facts
here
have
none
of
the
aspect
that
there
are
not
of
the
facts
that
lead
us
to
think
that
quota
as
a
bad
word.
what
we
call
this
doesn't
matter
and
if
we
call
it
a
quota,
knowing
the
facts
and
deciding
according
the
operative
facts
and
not
influence
by
the
semantic
couldn't
matter
less.
some
people
say
this
was
a
target.
i
prefer
not
to
call
it
either
because
target
is
taken
off
kind
of
thing.
but
i
would
emphasis
that
it
doesn't
point
the
finger
at
any
group.
it
doesn't
say
to
any
group
you
are
inferior.
it
doesn't
promise
taking
people
regardless
of
their
qualifications,
regardless
of
what
they
promise
society
and
promise
the
school.
i
don't
know
what
qualities
they
have
and
i
think
those
things
ended
it
is
not
forced
that
was
really
a
decision
by
the
school
as
to
how
much
of
its
assets.
what
part
of
its
assets?
it
would
allocate
to
the
purposes
that
it
felt
were
being
fulfilled
of
--
by
having
minorities
in
the
student
body
and
increasing
the
number
of
minorities
in
the
profession.
justice
stevens
let
me
--
let
us
suppose
that
the
student
must
not
--
that
the
school
was
much
concerned
by
the
lack
of
qualified
general
practitioners
in
northern
california.
as
indeed
it
was,
but
i
want
to
exaggerate
the
illustration
a
little
bit
and
they
told
the
admissions
committee,
get
people
that
come
from
rural
communities
if
they're
qualified
and
to
express
the
intention
of
going
back
there.
and
the
dean
of
admissions
might
well
say,
well,
how
much
importance
--
how
much
importance
could
give
this?
and
the
members
of
the
faculty
might
say
by
vote
her
otherwise
we
think
it's
terribly
important.
as
long
as
they're
qualified
try
and
get
10
in
the
group.
i
don't
think
i
would
say
there
was
a
quota
of
90
students
or
others.
and
i
think
this
while
it
involves
race,
of
course
and
that's
why
we're
here,
or
color
really
is
essentially
the
same
thing.
the
decision
of
the
university
was
that
there
are
social
purposes.
purposes
aimed
into
the
end
of
eliminating
racial
injustice
in
this
country
and
in
bringing
equal
--
equality
of
opportunity.
there
will
be
purposes
served
by
including
minority
student.
well,
how
important
you
think
it
is?
mr.
archibald
cox
we
think
it's
this
important?
mr.
archibald
cox
and
that's
the
significance
of
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
in
the
--
i
don't
like
to
liken
it
to
that
in
terms
of
its
importance
but
i
think
that
there
a
number
of
places
that
may
be
set
aside
for
an
institutions
of
different
aims.
and
the
aim
of
some
institutions
does
seem
to
be
--
to
have
athletic
prowess.
so
that
in
that
sense,
this
is
a
choice
made
to
promote
the
schools,
the
faculty's
choice
of
educational,
the
aim
of
mutual
and
professional
objectives
so
i
think
there
is
a
parallel.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
but
they
have
of
athletic?
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
come
from
harvard
sir.
i
don't
know
whether
it's
our
aim
but
we
don't
do
very
well.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
yes,
you're
quite
right.
well,
--
mr.
archibald
cox
maybe
i
better
stop.
i
can
almost
too.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
point
it
of
course
that
was
--
it's
because
the
purpose
of
the
athletic
and
social
purposes
of
an
undergraduate
school
are
different
for
those
of
professional
schools
that
i'm
frank
from
pressing
the
analogy
too
far.
although,
i
think
it's
logical
accurate
and
that
it
helps
ones
thinking.
well,
the
proofs
of
the
objectives
of
undergraduate
education
are
somewhat
broader,
somewhat
harder
to
define.
on
the
other
hand,
it's
clear
to
me
that
the
inclusion
of
minorities
and
undergraduate
college
may
be
at
least
as
important
as
that
a
professional
school.
and
the
date
of
course
they're
got
to
get
to
professional
school
they
have
to
be
there.
but
i
think
when
--
i
think
one
finds
that
the
objectives
of
these
programs
apply
in
large
part
to
undergraduate
colleges
as
well
as
professional
schools,
certainly
the
objective
of
improving
education
through
greater
diversity
or
is
perhaps
even
more
important
than
an
undergraduate
school
that
it
is
in
professional
school.
but
i
wouldn't
minimize
its
importance
of
the
professional
school
and
i
would
emphasize
its
important
when
it
comes
to
membership
in
the
professions,
so
that
the
professions
will
be
aware
of
all
segments
to
the
society.
i
think
the
objective
of
breaking
down
isolation
which
is
one
of
the
greatest
problems
of
achieving
racial
justice
in
this
country
is
served
by
including
minorities
i
would
say
about
equally
involved.
the
objective
that
impresses
itself
on
my
mind,
partly
because
dean
lowrey
testified
it,
and
partly
because
i
am
at
least
in
part
an
educator
is
the
importance
of
including
young
men
and
women
at
both
undergraduate
colleges
and
the
medical
schools,
so
that
the
other
younger
boys
and
girls
may
see,
yes,
it
is
possible
for
a
black
to
go
to
university
of
minnesota
or
to
go
harvard
or
yale.
i
know
johnny
down
the
street
and
i
know
sammy's
father,
he
became
a
lawyer
and
john's
father
became
a
doctor.
this
is
essential
if
we're
ever
going
to
give
true
equality
in
a
factual
sense
to
people
because
the
existence
or
non-existence
of
opportunities
and
surely
we
all
know
shapes
people's
aspirations
when
they're
very
young,
it
shapes
the
way
they
behave,
it
shapes
in
a
most
pedagogical
sense,
i
suspect
whether
they
do
or
don't
read
a
book
in
the
afternoon
whether
they
do
or
don't
read
at
school.(voice
overlap)
so,
i
think
all
these
applied
to
both
mr.
chief
justice
very
strongly.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
my
answer
is
this.
it's
one
which
i
draw
upon
judge
hastie
for
an
excellent
essay
he
wrote
on
this
subject.
that
so
long
as
the
numbers
of
chosen,
he
said
with
and
they're
shown
to
be
reasonably
adapted
to
the
social
goals.
and
i'm
thinking
of
the
one
you
mentioned
justice
rehnquist;
then
there
is
no
reason
to
condemn
a
program
because
of
the
particular
number
chosen.
i
would
say
that
perhaps
there
reas
--
i
don't
think
i
have
to
press
for
a
reasonably
related
test.
i
think
that
here
there
is
a
much
better
showing
than
that.
i
would
say
that
as
the
number
goes
up,
the
danger
of
invidiousness
or
the
danger
that
this
is
being
done
not
social
purposes
but
to
favor
one
group
as
against
another
group,
the
risk
if
you
will
of
a
finding
of
an
invidious
purpose
to
discriminate
against
is
greater
and
therefore
i
think
it's
a
harder
case
but
i
would
have
to
put
the
particular
school
in
the
context
of
old
schools.
there
are
programs
of
which
are
designed
for
example
to
train
indians,
to
go
back
and
teach
at
indian
reservations
and
nobody
else
is
talking
those
programs.
i
don't
think
it's
unconstitutional
when
you
see
it
the
total
context.
but
i
think
that
as
the
number
goes
up
it
raises
this
dangers,
fears,
and
the
possibility
of
an
adverse
finding
on
what
might
be
the
factually
dispositive
question
of
intent.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
--
i've
--
the
number
16
here
is
not
in
any
way
linked
to
population
in
california.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
this
was
16
--
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
i
think
it
to
--
as
the
number,
i
think
i
would
only
say
as
the
number
gets
higher.
i
think
that
it's
undesirable
to
have
the
number
late
to
population.
i'd
be
quite
frank
to
say
that
i
think
one
of
the
things
which
causes
all
us
concern
about
this
programs
is
a
danger
that
they
will
give
some
--
give
rise
to
some
notion
of
group
entitlement
to
numbers
regardless
either
of
the
ability
of
the
individual
or
of
which
not
always
related
to
inability
--
ability
in
the
narrow
sense,
all
of
their
potential
contribution
to
society.
and
i
think
that
if
the
program
were
begin
to
slide
over
in
that
direction
or
i
would
first
as
a
faculty
member
criticizing
and
opposing
as
a
constitutional
lawyer
and
the
farther
it
went
the
more
doubts
i
would
have.
but
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
this
program
was
not
of
that
character
and
in
fact
of
course
for
speaking
in
what's
going
to
happen
to
educational
all
over
the
country.
in
fact,
the
numbers
have
not
come
anywhere
but
minorities
submitted
to
professional
schools
have
not
come
anywhere
near
their
actual
percentage
in
the
population.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
think
it
is
not
at
all
relevant.
mr.
archibald
cox
there's
nothing
that
tells
how
it
is
taken
into
account.
in
the
benchmark
ratings,
i
would
infer
from
the
bench,
actual
benchmark
ratings
that
it
was
not
taken
into
account
in
the
benchmark
ratings
at
all.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
the
--
nothing
was
added
to
a
benchmark
rating
because
one
was
a
member
of
a
minority.
mr.
archibald
cox
they
may
--
i
--
there's
neither
--
there's
nothing
in
the
record
about
that
if
i
understood
your
question.
that
is
to
say,
there's
nothing
to
show
whether
people
were
being
rated
on
the
same
standards
when
they
were
in
the
task
force
program
or
when
they
were
in
general
pool.
it's
in
the
past,
i
don't
know
whether
anyone
could
ever
find
out
quite
frankly,
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
was
going
on
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
just
little
further.
alright.
there
wasn't
any
occasion
to
put
them
on
the
same
scale.
because
the
--
if
you
were
qualified
minority
and
disadvantage
then
you
are
eligible
for
one
of
the
16
places
and
there
was
no
occasion
for
you
to
be
compared
with
anyone
in
the
general
pool.
now
if
i
may
--
i
wanted
to
go
on
just
another
step
in
that
answer.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
is
fair
to
say
mr.
justice
and
i
don't
want
to
–
i
don't
want
to
slide
away
from
the
fact.
the
task
force
program
reduced
the
opportunity
of
a
non-disadvantaged,
non-minority
applicant
who
was
someone
near
the
borderline
or
below
it
to
get
into
davis
because
there
were
certain
number
of
places
which
were
allocated
for
this
purpose
just
as
a
certain
number
of
places
might
be
allocated
for
people
who
would
deliver
medical
services
as
general
practitioners
in
the
minority
area
in
a
rural
area.
the
other
thing
i
was
going
to
say
and
then
i'm
through
mr.
chief
justice
is
that
while
it
is
true
that
mr.
bakke
and
some
others
on
the
conventional
standards
for
admission
would
be
ranked
above
the
minority
applicant.
i
want
to
emphasize
that
in
my
judgment
and
i
think
in
fact
that
does
not
justify
saying
that
the
better,
generally
better
qualified
people
are
excluded
to
make
room
for
generally
less
qualified
people.
and
nothing
that
chose
would
ask
in
the
first
two
years
of
medical
school
of
the
grade
point
averages
will
make
the
minority
students,
poor
medical
students
and
still
less
to
show
that
it
makes
them
poorer
doctors
or
poorer
citizens
or
poorer
people.
its
quite
clear
that
for
some
of
the
things
that
a
medical
school
wishes
to
accomplish
and
this
medical
school
wish
to
accomplish
that
the
minority
applicant
they
have
qualities
to
there
superior
to
those
of
his
classmate
who
is
not
minority.
you
certainly
would
be
more
effective
in
bringing
it
home
to
the
young
chicano
that
he
too
may
become
a
doctor.
he
too
may
attend
graduate
school.
he
may
be
far
more
likely
to
come
back
to
such
a
community
to
practice
medicine
or
his
native,
forgive
me,
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
it
does,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
shall
perhaps
better
than
anything
else
that
they
have
been
the
victim
of
the
jury
discrimination
over
the
years.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
had
--
i
had
in
mind
to
oyama,
i
think
that's
most
known.
it's
not
the
most
recent
case
but
takahashi
is
such
a
case.
they
go
back
to
yick
wo
and
i'm
sure
there's
three
or
four
more
your
honor
will
think
off
quickly.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
are
no
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
think
there
any
figures
in
the
record
and
there
are
very
few
figures
on
minority
participation
in
the
professions
published
except
with
the
respect
to
black
doctors
and
black
medical
students.
the
others,
there's
submitting
full
figures
on
chicanos
but
the
others
are
various
gathered,
and
they
not
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
because
the
supreme
court
of
california
ruled
only
on
the
federal
constitution
and
i
would
think
the
other
questions
were
not
before
this
court.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
that
the
trial
court's
ruling
has
no
more
importance
within
a
potential
ground
for
state
ground
or
here
statutory
ground
for
decision
that
the
plaintiff
urges
which
is
ruled
out
in
anything.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
realize
they
do
but
it
wasn't
--
it
wasn't
included
in
any
of
the
questions
presented
or
it
wasn't
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
believe
the
court
has
indicated
that
it
is
necessary
for
it
to
be
raise
in
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
my
understanding
is
that
the
--
while
that
was
the
earlier
role
that
the
court
has
recently
change
and
indicated
that
the
respondent
cannot
support
an
additional
ground
which
is
not
been
brought
to
the
court's
attention
at
the
time
of
the
petition.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
have
it
on
the
top
my
--
but
i
may
be
mistaken.
i
was
familiar
with
the
older
rule
but
was
corrected
mr.
justice
and
i'm
repeating
to
correct
that
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
all
medical
schools
get
grants
including
one
in
effect
grants
per
student.
so
we
can't
seriously
deny
it.
i
don't
think
that
it
was
proved
in
the
record
but
it
is
a
fact.
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
not
--
it's
in
the
respondent
of
course
doesn't
press
this
argument
here.
and
there
are
number
of
questions,
mr.
justice,
lurking
if
this
is
to
be
explored.
for
example
there's
some
question
whether
an
individual
may
sue
under
title
vi.
there's
a
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
not
under
title
vi
but
under
an
analogous
situation
dealing
with
discrimination
against
women
holding
that
an
individual
cannot
sue
and
it
would
seem
by
analogy
to
be
up
here.
neither
there
a
lot
of
points
that
haven't
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
been
adequately
covered
because
we
didn't
think
it
was
in
the
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
could
be
that
the
--
i
must
plead
inability
to
assist
that
just
by
later
letter
mr.
justice.
i'm
not
--
i
have
this
case
on
the
top
--
mr.
archibald
cox
it
was
pleaded.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
well,
the
briefs
do
in
composite
very
briefly.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
is
correct
and
it
would
remain
like
the
state
ground.
it
would
remain
open
on
remand.
when
i
say
like
the
state
ground
the
results
of
fine
--
a
ruling
by
the
trial
court.
if
there
was
a
violation
of
the
california
equal
protection
clause
and
that
of
course
would
remain
open.
if
this
we
hope
this
case
reverses
and
depends.
that's
--
that's
always
true
of
undecided
state
questions
on
which
the
respondent
may
hope
to
retain
his
judgment.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
is
my
understanding
--
mr.
archibald
cox
but
i
do
not
wish
to
mislead
your
honor
and
say
that
that
clearly
appears
on
the
record
anyway.
but
it
should
push
it
in
the
logic
of
the
situation.
remember
that
the
task
force
applicants
were
being
considered
by
the
task
force
subcommittee.
incidentally,
it's
the
majority
of
the
faculty
were
not
minority.
there
was
one
minority
there.
its
function
was
to
admit
up
to
16
qualified
minority
and
educationally
are
disadvantaged
applicants.
it
wasn't
comparing
them
--
it
wasn't
charge
with
comparing
them
with
anyone
else
and
therefore
the
benchmarks
it
put
on
them
were
only
for
the
purpose
of
comparing
them
with
each
other.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
but
whether
that
--
it's
certainly
yes,
as
the
numbers
were
scored
whether
in
fact
the
numbers
are
comparable,
i
don't
know.
i
do
want
to
stress
that
as
we
see
the
case.
this
is
not
a
matter
of
a
contest
to
be
judge
according
to
certain
standards
of
performance
on
grades
or
a
price
to
be
awarded
that
the
institution
has
important
of
broader
educational
professional
and
social
purposes.
so
that
for
purposes
of
all
of
these.
it
may
be
more
important
to
have
a
qualified
member
of
a
minority
there.
that
it
is
to
have
somebody
whose
benchmark
was
higher
and
this
is
the
kind
of
judgment
that
has
to
be
made.
i
would
like
to
direct
my
attention,
if
i
may,
to
one
important
point
and
that's
again
the
significance
of
the
number
16.
we
submit
first
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
outlaw
race-conscious
programs
where
there
is
no
invidious
purpose
or
intent
where
they
are
aimed
at
offsetting
the
consequences
of
a
--
our
long
tragic
history
of
discrimination
and
achieving
greater
racial
equity.
and
we
think
that
these
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
he
has
to
consider
the
all
the
facts.
they
were
most
recently
laid
out
in
justice
powell's
opinion
in
the
arlington
heights
case.
the
sort
of
thing
that
he
thought
the
court
should
consider.
if
your
honor
is
asking
me
what
do
i
mean
by
invidious,
i
mean
primarily,
stigmatizing,
marking
as
inferior.
mr.
archibald
cox
shutting
out
of
participation
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
have
to
make
this
turn
on
a
subjective
inquiry
i
think
but
i
would
also
have
to
look
and
see
what
the
fifth
significance
of
the
50
students
was
in
the
overall
context
of
the
community
its
educational
system
in
the
state.
and
i
would
--
i
suppose
i
would
be
governed
partly
by
purpose
and
partly
by
effect
but
that
would
leave
me
back
to
purpose.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
if
the
finding
is
that
this
was
reasonably
adopted
to
the
purpose
of
increasing
the
number
of
minority
doctors
or
and
that
it
was
not
in
arbitrary,
capricious,
selfish,
setting
and
that
would
have
to
be
decided
in
the
light
of
the
other
medical
schools
in
the
state
and
the
needs
of
the
state.
but
if
it's
a
solidly
based
then
i
would
say
50
was
permissible.
just
as
in
my
example,
i
said
that
educating
only
indians
in
a
program
tailored
to
training,
teachers
to
go
back
to
indian
reservations.
it
seems
to
me
to
be
constitutional
and
there
are
such
programs
that
both
private
and
state
institutions.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
will
and
should,
yes.
in
our
view,
the
other
alternative
suggested
simply
won't
work.
one
is
to
build
more
medical
schools.
well,
davis
was
a
middle
medical
school
and
it
did
not
have
any,
until
it
adopted
this
program,
virtually
no
blacks
or
chicanos
were
admitted.
one
would
have
to
increase
the
number
of
medical
schools
out
of
all
reason
before
that
would
produce
substantial
numbers
of
minorities
under
the
conventional
admissions
test.
second
suggestion
is
better
recruiting.
that
suggestion
seems
to
us
to
overlook
the
extensive
recruiting
efforts
that
were
made
during
the
late
60's
that
are
describe
in
odegaard
minorities
in
medicine
which
incidentally
is
probably
the
best
reference
spoke
on
this
subject
and
other
references
in
our
brief.
it
also
assumes
that
there
are
out
there
a
lot
high
test
score,
high
college
grade,
members
of
minorities
that
haven't
applied
or
been
found
by
any
law
school,
any
medical
school,
or
any
graduate
school.
it
just
seems
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well
then
the
next
suggestion
is
that
something
be
done
for
all
disadvantaged.
that
won't
meet
this
--
i
don't
want
to
keep
anything
from
disadvantaged
or
to
talk
down
any
program
that
was
rather
disadvantaged.
but
i've
--
that
would
not
meet
the
specific
needs
for
which
these
programs
are
tailored
for
two
reasons.
first,
the
minorities
are
only
a
minor
fraction
of
all
disadvantaged.
second,
all
the
study
show
whatever
the
explanation
that
minority
students
do
worst
among
the
students
of
families
who
are
economic
dis
--
economically
disadvantaged,
just
as
they
do
worst
when
you
take
total
ratio
of
applicant
so
that
the
program
for
the
disadvantaged
would
not
bring
substantial
numbers
of
minorities
into
the
school.
the
other
suggestion
that
has
been
made
is
that
we
should
not
use
the
word
race.
we
should
talk
about
choosing
people
for
admission
to
medical
colleges
who
are
most
likely
to
go
to
those
communities
that
have
been
the
victims
of
discrimination
and
the
need
better
medical
care.
but
don't
ever
say
the
word
or
that
we
should
get
those
who
will
be
role
models
for
the
communities
in
which
the
past
is
denied
the
ambition
to
young
people,
certainly,
ambition
to
this
kind
of
role
in
the
community.
those
i
submit
are
circumlocutions,
they're
euphemisms,
or
if
we're
talking
about
realities,
race
is
a
fact.
it
is
something
that
all
kinds
of
social
feelings,
context,
a
vision
one's
opportunity
is
related
to.
and
if
one
is
going
the
meaningfully
direct
these
programs
in
social
objective
it's
simply
still
defying
to
disregard
a
reality
that
we
hope
will
stop
having
significance
in
these
areas
and
which
will
have
more
sig
--
in
which
we
have
a
best
chance
of
depriving
of
its
present
unfortunate
significance,
if
these
programs
are
permitted
to
continue
and
succeed.
may
i
save,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
few
minutes
i
have
left?
mr.
archibald
cox
perhaps
i
should
better
use
it
in
rebuttal
and
i
can
see
what
the
court
is
focusing
on.
mr.
archibald
cox
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
archibald
cox
chief
justice.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
do
not
agree.
i
disagree
and
i
develop
the
reasons
if
i
may
that
was
one
of
the
points
that
i
plan
to
address
myself
to.
i
think
perhaps
i
can
be
most
helpful
by
trying
to
put
the
very
particular
points
we
covered
in
my
argument,
within
a
larger
framework
of
my
basic
thinking.
the
first
main
proposition
that
i
would
assert
is
that
the
racially
conscious
admissions
program
at
davis
and
any
racially
conscious
admissions
program
designed
to
increase
the
number
of
minorities
to
their
profession
school,
is
fully
consistent
with
both
the
letter
and
the
spirit
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
i
simply
want
to
add
one
footnote
to
say
that
when
i
use
the
word
race
or
racially
conscious,
i'm
not
speaking
of
race
the
way
one
would
speak
of
a
red-headed
man,
or
a
man
that
has
some
other
mark
that
is
sheer
happenstance,
that
isn't
the
quality
of
race
in
our
society
today,
and
i'm
really
talking
about
all
the
things
that
have
gone
with
race
and
the
remnants
of
those
things
in
terms
of
current
soulful
problems,
that
race
is
a
shorthand
for
expressing.
now,
that
main
proposition
the
way
it
would
develop
and
i'd
simply
state
them
in
three
points.
we
say
first
that
there
is
no
perceived
rule
of
color
blindness
incorporated
in
the
equal
protection
clause.
we
say
second
that
the
educational,
professional
and
social
purposes
accomplished
by
a
race
conscious
admissions
program
are
compelling
objectives
or
to
put
it
practically,
they
are
more
than
sufficient
justification,
for
those
losses,
for
those
problems
that
are
created
by
the
use
of
race.
we
don't
minimize
them
but
we
say
that
the
cost
is
greatly
outweighed
by
the
gains.
and
third,
as
i
said
my
argument,
we
submit
that
there
is
no
other
way
of
accomplishing
those
purposes.
now,
this
brings
me
to
the
point
that
the
supreme
court
of
california
was
wrong,
that
its
judgment
should
be
reversed
because
it
said
that
under
present
circumstances,
we
may
not
take
race
into
account,
that's
what
mr.
colvin
pitched
his
case
on,
that's
the
proposition
he
presented
below,
he
presented
here,
justice
powell,
he
doesn't
need
any
more
facts
on
then.
he's
either
right
or
wrong
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
or
a
statutory
law
if
he
goes
back
to
the
court
below.
there
is
a
further
question,
is
there
something
about
the
use
of
the
number
16
that
renders
this
program
peculiarly
valid?
there
are
a
lot
of
educational
institutions
that
pursue
minority
admissions
program
but
the
admissions
committee
has
instructed
to
get
a
good
number,
get
a
substantial
number,
get
within
the
range
of
10
to
20%.
now,
we
submit
that
the
method
of
putting
the
general
policy
into
actual
practice,
the
level
at
which
somebody
reduces
into
numbers
is
not
a
matter
of
constitutional
dimension
and
for
like
reason,
we
say
that
the
questions
raised
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief
are
not
matters
of
constitutional
dimension.
they
are
details
of
admission
programs
and
in
both
instances
we
urge
that
the
--
this
court
should
not
get
the
lower
federal
courts
into
being
the
supervisors
of
the
admissions
policies
of
certainly
state
and
perhaps
private
institutions.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
but
i'm
suggesting
that
the
details
to
which
i
was
addressing
myself
where
of
a
different
order
of
magnitude,
you
have
to
decide
whether
we
are
right
in
saying
that
race
may
be
taken
into
account
for
proper
purposes,
of
course
you
will.
i
do
stress
and
even
with
respect
to
the
main
question
but
i
think
it's
more
important
as
one
gets
down
to
what
i
regard
as
detail
such
as
this
specific
number.
i
do
stress
two
things.
one
is
the
judicializing
or
constitutionalizing,
the
drawing
of
courts
in,
the
writing
of
monolithic
rules
tends
to
dampen
one
of
the
great
--
abandon
one
of
the
greatest
sources
of
creativity
in
this
country
the
opportunity
in
dealing
with
delicate
sensitive
and
often
painful.
it's
not
easy
to
turn
down
young
men
and
women,
and
in
dealing
with
those
problems,
we
are
wise
to
take
advantage
of
the
fact
that
there
are
50
states,
were
wise
to
take
advantage
so
far
as
the
legislatures
will
allow
it,
of
the
fact
that
different
campuses
or
different
faculties
are
allowed
to
make
up
their
own
minds,
and
i
think
that
to
set
a
lot
of
rules
that
would
draw
the
federal
courts
into
scrutinizing
the
details
of
what
is
done
would
invite
constant
litigation
and
as
i
say
it
would
abandon
a
source
of
creativity,
it
would
destroy
important
autonomy
in
wrestling
which
with
i
argued
and
i'm
sure
all
court
recognize
as
an
extraordinarily
sensitive
and
difficult
problem
but
a
search
for
justice
to
all
to
which
this
country
has
always
been
committed
and
to
which
i'm
sure
is
still
is.
