mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
i
think
that
the
honorable
wade
mccree's
last
remark
was
something
of
a
prediction
that
i
might
not
disappoint
him
and
i
will
try
not
to.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
first
thing
that
i
ought
to
say
to
this
honorable
court
is
that
i
am
allan
bakke's
lawyer
and
allan
bakke
is
my
client
and
i
do
not
say
that
in
any
formal
or
perfunctory
way,
i
say
that
because
this
is
a
lawsuit.
it
was
a
lawsuit
brought
by
allan
bakke,
up
at
woodland
in
yolo
county,
california
in
which
allan
bakke
from
the
very
beginning
of
this
lawsuit
in
the
first
paper
we
ever
filed,
stated
the
case
and
he
stated
the
case
in
terms
of
his
individual
right.
he
stated
the
case
in
terms
of
the
fact
that
he
had
twice
applied
for
an
admission
to
the
medical
school
of
davis
and
twice
he
had
been
refused,
both
in
the
years
1973
and
the
year
1974.
and
he
stated
in
that
complaint
what
now
some
three
and
a
half
years
later,
proves
to
be
the
very
heart
of
the
thing
that
we're
talking
about
at
this
juncture.
he
stated
that
he
was
excluded
from
that
school
because
that
school
had
adopted
a
racial
quota
which
deprived
him
of
the
opportunity
for
admission
into
the
school
and
that's
where
the
case
started.
it
started
with
a
suit
against
the
university.
he
stated
three
grounds
upon
which
he
felt
that
he
had
been
deprived
of
the
right
to
admission
to
that
school,
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
privileges
and
immunities
portion
of
the
california
constitution,
and
title
vi
42
of
the
united
states
code
2000
(d)
and
those
were
the
three
grounds
upon
which
he
placed
this
complaint
from
the
very
beginning.
the
university
--
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
i
wanted
to
get
to
that
and
i
quite
agree
and
let
me
say
it
now
so
that
it's
out
of
the
way.
we
have
no
contention
here
that
allan
bakke
has
a
constitutional
right
or
even
a
statutory
right
to
be
in
a
medical
school.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
am
sure
that
if
the
regents
of
the
university
of
california
had
decided
to
close
the
medical
school
at
davis
that
allan
bakke
couldn't
stand
up
here
through
his
lawyer
or
even
get
beyond
the
first
demurrer
in
the
superior
court
of
woodland
and
say
i
have
a
right
to
go
to
the
medical
school.
that
is
not
allan
bakke's
position.
allan
bakke's
position
is
that
he
has
a
right
and
that
right
is
not
to
be
discriminated
against
by
reason
of
his
race
and
that's
what
brings
allan
bakke
to
this
court.
now,
let
me
go
on
for
just
a
moment
with
what
happened
in
the
lawsuit
because
it's
very
important
that
we
follow
this
step
by
step.
the
university
at
the
very
beginning
did
several
things.
first,
they
denied
that
it
was
--
that
they
had
a
racial
quota.
i
think
that's
disappeared
from
the
case.
secondly,
they
denied
that
mr.
bakke
would
have
been
admitted
even
have
there
been
no
racial
quota
and
as
i
will
indicate
at
some
length
i
hope
later
on,
that's
disappeared
in
the
case.
they
admitted,
speaking
of
the
scope
of
section
2000
(d),
they
admitted
that
they
were
a
federally
funded
institution
but
they
did
more
than
that.
they
did
more
that.
they
then
filed
a
cross-complaint
against
allan
bakke
and
within
the
cross-complaint,
they
sought
their
own
kind
of
relief
and
the
relief
which
they
sought
was
the
relief
that
their
program
be
declared
constitutional,
not
only
constitutional
buy
constitutional
within
the
federal
sense
and
within
the
california
sense
and
something
else,
that
it
also
be
declared
constitutional
within
the
meaning
of
2000
(d),
that
is
title
vi
and
so
the
issue
was
joined.
now,
bear
in
mind,
bear
in
mind
the
whole
scope
of
what
we're
talking
about
in
this
lawsuit.
here
we
are
in
september
--
in
june
of
1964,
we
filed
a
complaint,
the
name
of
the
game
is
not
to
represent
--
is
not
to
represent
allan
bakke,
as
a
representative
of
a
class.
we
are
not
representing
allan
bakke
as
a
representative
of
some
organization.
this
is
not
an
exercise
in
a
law
review
article
or
a
bar
examination
question,
this
is
a
question
of
getting
mr.
bakke
into
the
medical
school
and
that's
the
name
of
the
game
and
we
have
to
do
that
in
order
to
be
effective
as
lawyers
and
we
humbly
tried
to
be
effective
as
lawyers,
sometime
between
june
of
1974
and
the
entering
class
of
september
of
1974
and
if
you
read
the
record,
you
will
see
the
frantic
efforts
we
make
to
get
before
the
court
and
we
tried
to
get
before
the
court
on
a
question
of
injunction,
on
a
questions
of
mandamus,
on
a
question
of
a
declaratory
relief,
each
of
them
moving
the
thing
forward
on
the
calendar.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
no
but
i
--
i'm
relieved
to
hear
but
that
wasn't
exactly
my
point
if
i
may
just
continue
for
the
moment.
i
wanted
to
continue
for
the
moment
to
discuss
the
dimension
of
the
record
because
that's
part
of
what
has
been
said
here
and
in
order
to
indicate
the
record
and
why
the
record
is
in
the
posture
that
the
record
is
in.
the
first
thing
that
we
did
within
the
record
was
to
take
the
deposition
of
dr.
lowrey
and
after
we
took
the
deposition
of
dr.
lowrey,
dr.
lowrey's
deposition
was
further
bolstered
by
dr.
lowrey's
declaration
prepared
no
doubt
with
the
assistance
of
his
counsel.
now,
where
do
we
find
--
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
no.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
no,
that
is
not
--
it's
true
and
it's
not
true.
may
i
explain,
sir?
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
the
answer
to
that
is
no
but
the
answer
to
the
question
--
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
no,
we
accepted
--
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
well,
it
was
hearsay
by
the
dean
of
admissions
who
was
administering
a
program
and
if
i
may
just
say
this
i
will
not
attempt
to
get
into
a
discussion
of
what
is
hearsay
and
what
is
not
hearsay
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
it
was
dr.
lowrey
who
was
administering
the
program
by
both
in
1973
and
in
1974
and
more
than
that,
it
was
dr.
lowrey
himself
who
had
reviewed
and
interviewed
mr.
bakke
in
1974.
so
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that
we
were
not
exploring
to
the
testimony
of
some
official
who
was
200
miles
away
as
to
what
had
happened.
dr.
lowrey
was
there
on
the
seat.
justice
marshall,
you
are
correct
in
this
respect
that
at
the
time
that
the
faculty
adopted
the
resolution,
dr.
lowrey
was
elsewhere.
i
believe
from
my
recollection
of
the
deposition
that
he
was
at
the
university
of
michigan.
i
may
be
mistaken
on
that
that
but
that
is
my
recollection.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
what
we
think
and
was
quite
clear.
let
me
answer
that.
i
am
satisfied.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
my
answer
is
yes.
my
answer
is
that
dr.
lowrey
was
the
dean
of
admissions
that
he
brought
with
him
to
the
deposition,
every
piece
of
paper
for
which
we
had
asked
for
that
he
had
personally
interviewed
mr.
bakke
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
record
of
the
interview
are
between
dr.
lowrey
--
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
the
doctor
--
mr.
bakke
was
turned
down
for
admission
--
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
the
rules
were
simply
that
8%
--
that
16%
of
the
entering
class.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
no,
no
8%
is
the
number.
i'm
sorry
--
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
may
i
start
over
again?
it
was
always
16%.
in
the
early
years,
--
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
no,
in
the
early
years
of
the
school
there
were
just
50
admitted
in
the
entering
class.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
the
rule
says
16%.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
16%
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
well,
i
--
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
in
dr.
lowrey's
deposition.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
that's
where
we
find
it
yes.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
in
my
judgment
--
in
my
judgment,
it
would
only
be
hearsay
in
the
sense
that
it
relates
to
the
historical
origin
of
the
rule
but
it
is
not
hearsay
as
it
relates
to
the
way
the
rule
was
imposed
in
the
two
years
that
dr.
--
that
mr.
--
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
well,
we
do
know
that
it
came
about
by
faculty
vote.
that
is
in
the
record.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
that
is
in
the
record.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
well,
we
also
--
we
also
know
that
statistics
were
kept
and
they
are
in
the
record
for
each
of
the
--
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
that
question
was
asked
of
dr.
lowrey.
in
the
deposition
of
dr.
lowrey
--
i
asked
dr.
lowrey
two
questions.
the
first
question
was,
“was
there
any
definition
of
the
term
educationally
disadvantaged?”
the
answer
was
no.
and
the
second
question
was,
“was
there
a
definition
of
the
term
economically
disadvantaged?”
then
the
answer
was
no.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
yes,
yes.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
i
don't
believe
--
i
don't
believe
there
was.
other
that
--
except
that
i
may
say
--
if
i
may
say
most
respectfully
then
i
do
have
the
feeling
as
a
lawyer
that
a
--
that
you
have
two
things
in
the
record.
you
have
the
deposition
of
dr.
lowrey
the
dean
of
admissions.
you
have
the
declaration
of
dr.
lowrey,
the
dean
of
admissions
and
i
think
that
a
fair
reading
of
both
of
those
documents
lays
out
pretty
well
what
the
situation
was.
i
--
whether
something
was
technically
hearsay,
i
really
couldn't
argue
that
point.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
well,
we
believe
--
yes,
we
believe
that
there
is
a
very
important
kind
of
controversy
which
is
involved
here
and
that
is
precisely
the
controversy
over
the
concept
of
quota.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
well,
we
think
--
we
think
in
general,
yes.
we
think
there
are
a
lot
of
factual
elements
to
it.
let
me
make
a
distinction
on
this
quota
question
if
i
may,
your
honor.
there
are
many
points
in
the
university's
brief
where
somehow
in
order
to
take
the
sting
out
of
the
word
quota,
the
word
goal
is
used.
this
is
not
a
quota
they
say
but
it
is
a
goal.
we
find
that
to
be
a
real
misuse
of
language.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
although
the
factual
question
if
i
may
respond
to
that
just
briefly
arises
in
somehow
in
a
different
way
and
let
me
illustrate
it
this
way
because
it
is
a
factual
--
there
is
a
factual
circumstance
involved
and
let
me
try
to
spell
out
what
i
believe
that
factual
circumstance
to
be.
normally,
if
we
have
a
goal,
--
if
we
have
a
goal.
if
we're
going
to
get
a
number
of
people
in,
we
select
a
standard
and
then
above
that
standard,
we
admit
people
in
order
to
--
in
order
to
qualify.
precisely
the
opposite
is
true
here.
in
this
case,
we
have
to
follow
what
the
factual
situation
is.
here
we
have
a
quota
where
the
number
is
first
chosen
and
then
the
number
is
filled
regardless
of
the
standard
and
let
me
say
precisely
from
the
record
what
i
mean.
when
we
take
dr.
lowrey's
deposition,
one
of
the
very
first
questions
asked
dr.
lowrey
is
this
question,
what
is
the
standard
for
admission
to
the
school?
and
dr.
lowrey's
response
is
that
the
standard
is
that
we
will
interview
no
one
who
has
a
grade
point
average
below
2.5.
now,
let's
look
at
the
record
on
that
point.
in
the
year
1973,
the
people
within
the
quota
or
special
admissions
program
have
overall
grade
point
averages
which
run
all
the
way
down
to
2.21
in
--
that's
in
1974.
in
1973,
they
run
all
the
way
down
to
2.11
but
the
science
grade
point
averages
for
that
group
and
i
am
not
giving
you
averages.
i
mean
to
say
range.
the
range
runs
all
the
way
down
to
2.02,
that's
the
grade
point
average
side.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
i
certainly
do.
we
certainly
do
dispute
it
not
upon
the
ground
--
not
upon
the
ground
that
mr.
bakke
is
attempting
to
tell
the
school
what
the
qualifications
are
nor
upon
the
ground
that
we
as
his
counsel
can
somehow
set
up
a
rule
which
will
tell
us
who
is
qualified
to
go
medical
school.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
i'm
sorry,
sir.
i
sometimes
think
of
it
as
a
retreat.
the
--
but
the
point
that
we
are
making
now,
is
this
that
the
rules
as
to
admission
were
fixed
neither
by
bakke
nor
his
attorneys
but
were
fixed
by
the
school
itself.
they
were
the
ones
who
chose
grade
point
averages
and
they
were
the
ones
who
chose
mcat
scores
as
a
basis
for
judging
admissions
and
let
me
say
this
about
the
mcat
scores
because
it
relates
again
to
the
question
that
i
was
answering
as
to
the
difference
between
a
goal
and
a
quota.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
no,
but
that
was
their
rule.
that
was
their
rule
and
i
think
there's
a
fair
inference
from
the
record
that
there
was
a
reasonable
basis
for
dr.
lowrey
stating
that
that
was
the
rule
of
the
school.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
it
was
an
administrative
basis
but
at
least,
it
was
their
basis.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
we
simply
say
that
we
do
not
agree,
we
do
not
agree
that
there
is
a
showing
that
they
were
qualified.
we
are
not
making
the
argument
that
they
disqualified
but
we
are
saying
taking
the
school's
own
standards,
taking
the
very
thing
that
the
school
was
talking
about,
they
simply
do
not
measure
up
on
that
point.
but
let
me
finish
if
i
may
because
it
is
hard
to
--
it's
hard
to
finish
all
of
these
things
and
i
do
want
to
comment
about
the
same
thing
as
it
applies
to
the
mcat
scores.
you
will
recall
that
in
dr.
lowrey's
deposition,
dr.
lowrey
says,
we
would
be
hard
pressed.
we
would
be
hard
pressed
to
admit
people
to
the
school
if
they
had
mcat,
medical
college
aptitude
test
percentiles
in
science
and
in
verbal
which
were
below
50
but
look
at
the
record
in
the
case.
look
at
the
record
in
the
case.
in
1973,
the
average,
not
the
range
but
the
average
of
the
people
of
the
special
admissions
group
was
in
the
35th
percentile
in
science
and
in
the
46th
percentile
in
verbal.
in
1974,
the
percentile
in
science
and
this
is
an
average
and
not
a
range
was
37
and
in
verbal
34.
allan
bakke
--
allan
bakke
took
the
test
only
once
and
his
record
is
there.
you
will
find
it
on
page
13
of
our
brief.
he
scored
in
the
97th
percentile
in
science
and
in
the
96th
percentile
in
verbal.
the
ultimate
fact
in
this
case
no
matter
how
you
turn
it
is
that
mr.
bakke
was
deprived
of
an
opportunity
to
attend
the
school
by
reason
of
his
race.
this
is
not
a
matter
of
conjecture.
this
is
a
stipulation
by
the
regents
of
the
university
of
california.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
well,
yes.
i
think
i'm
afraid
that
--
i'm
afraid
that
i
ought
to.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
well,
i
don't
want
to
take
up
my
time
except
to
say
that
there
is
within
this
record
the
stipulation
of
the
regents
of
the
university
of
california
that
mr.
bakke
was
deprived
of
the
opportunity
to
attend
the
university
of
california
medical
school
at
davis
because
of
the
use
of
the
16
places
by
the
special
admissions
program.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
yes,
i
would
like
to
address
the
problems
that
arise
with
quota
and
the
problems
that
arise
with
race,
and
i
would
like
also
to
address
the
alternative
which
the
university
suggests.
we
have
the
deepest
difficulty
in
dealing
with
this
problem
of
quota
and
many,
many
questions
arise
for
example
there
is
a
question
of
numbers.
what
is
the
appropriate
quota
--
what
is
the
appropriate
quota
for
a
medical
school?
16,
8,
32,
64,
100?
on
what
basis
--
on
what
basis
is
that
quota
determined
and
there
is
a
problem,
a
very
serious
problem
of
judicial
determination.
does
the
--
does
the
court
leave
open
to
the
school
the
right
to
choose
any
number
at
once
in
order
to
satisfy
that
quota?
would
the
court
be
satisfied
to
allow
an
institution
such
as
the
university
of
california
to
adopt
a
quota
of
100%
and
thus
deprive
all
persons
who
are
not
people
within
selected
minority
groups?
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
our
response
to
that
is
fundamentally
that
race
an
improper
classification
in
this
situation.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
government
in
its
own
brief
makes
that
very
point.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
the
california
court
made
those
assumptions
arguendo.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
well,
we
think
--
we
think
that
we
need
not
disagree
with
them
that
they
are
fair
--
that
they
are
fair
assumptions
but
if
went
much
further.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
we
assume
as
the
court
did
that
those
specific
interests,
not
all
of
them
but
that
those
specific
interests
are
compelling
interests.
our
problem
is
--
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
we
might
someday
come
to
that.
but
i
don't
think
we
come
to
it
in
this
case
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
we
believe
that
it's
unconstitutional,
we
do.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
no,
not
because
it's
limited
to
16
but
because
the
concept
of
race
itself
as
a
classification
becomes
in
our
history
and
in
our
understanding
an
unjust
and
improper
basis
upon
which
to
judge
people.
we
do
not
believe
that
intelligence,
that
achievement,
that
ability
are
measured
by
skin
pigmentation
or
by
the
last
surname
of
an
individual
whether
or
not
it
sounds
spanish
or
--
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
oh!
there's
no
question
about
what
the
16
places
was
dominantly
by
race
and
i
have
to
go
back
to
the
record,
if
i
may
just
to
reach
that
point.
there
were
no
non-minority
people
who
were
ever
admitted
to
the
special
admission
program
and
i
do
not
mean
that
that
was
for
the
lack
of
trying.
in
the
years
1973
and
1974,
245
people
whom
the
university
itself
classified
as
economically
--
as
white
economically
disadvantaged
sought
admission
into
those
places.
and
there
were
none
admitted
either
in
those
two
years
or
in
any
years
and
that
was
more
than
a
third
of
all
of
the
people
who
sought
to
get
into
the
program
but
they
could
not
and
so
that
you
had
a
program
at
the
university
of
california
medical
school
at
davis
where
people
were
shut
out
from
16
of
the
places
and
our
belief
in
this
case
is
that
this
is
done
essentially
because
the
universities
will
not
follow,
will
not
follow
the
suggestion
of
the
california
supreme
court
and
the
--
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
well,
we
do
support
the
conclusion
that
there
were
alternatives
and
i
would
like
to
comment
on
that
face
of
the
case.
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
suggestion
which
the
california
supreme
court
made
was
that
the
universities
looked
at
people
in
terms
of
disadvantaged,
looked
at
people
individually
in
terms
of
disadvantaged.
now,
i
know
and
we
all
know
that
there
are
cases
that
are
deemed
to
be
societal
discrimination
where
millions
and
tens
of
million
people
are
involved
particularly
people,
particularly
cases
dealing
perhaps
with
social
security,
cases
dealing
with
women.
that
is
not
this
case.
there
were
100
people
who
were
enrolled
each
year
into
the
davis
medical
school.
it
may
have
been
administratively
difficult.
it
may
have
been
administratively
difficult
for
people
for
the
administrators
of
the
school
to
look
at
the
hundred
and
to
select
those
who
may
would
have
admit
upon
the
basis
of
disadvantaged.
the
problem
is
that
the
university
has
become
quota
happy.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
to
the
extent
that
the
judgment
is
made
on
whether
those
doctors
are
disadvantaged,
it
is
a
legitimate
means
to
the
extent
and
the
univer
--
and
the
supreme
court
of
california
says
this
to
the
extent
that
the
preference
is
on
the
basis
of
the
race,
we
believe
that
it's
an
unconstitutional
advantage.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
we
say
it
is
a
permissible
goal
and
if
--
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
because
the
university
--
because
the
supreme
court
says
to
the
university,
you
cannot
lead
to
the
quota
system.
what
you
must
first
do
is
to
undertake
to
meet
the
question
of
disadvantaged
where
it
exists
if
it
exists.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
yes,
but
the
supreme
court
comes
back
to
the
university
and
says
what
you
are
doing
is
skipping
one
step.
you
are
not
--
the
reason,
what
is
the
reason?
what
is
the
reason
for
this
goal?
what
is
the
reason
why
people
are
saying
we
want
more
chicano
doctors,
more
black
doctors,
more
oriental
doctors,
the
reason
is
because
we
claim
that
there
was
disadvantaged.
the
difficulty
is
with
the
racial
classification
is
that
we
are
engaging
in
these
broad
generalizations
that
everyone
of
a
given
race
has
suffered
the
same
advantage,
or
the
same
disadvantage,
the
same
welfare
or
the
same
poverty,
the
same
education
or
the
same
lack
of
education.
the
prob
--
the
event
--
there
are
two
benefits
for
the
university
to
look
at
the
question
of
advantage
and
the
first
of
those
benefits
is
that
it
does
not
run
into
a
constitutional
difficulty
and
the
second
advantage
or
the
second
benefit
of
looking
at
the
question
of
disadvantaged
is
that
it
meets
the
problem
where
it
exists.
it
meets
it
at
the
point
of
the
individual.
it
does
not
generalize.
it
is
not
true
that
all
members
of
a
given
race
have
exactly
the
same
experience,
the
same
wealth,
the
same
education
and
that's
the
point
that
justice
mosk
is
making
in
the
california
supreme
court.
he
says
it
is
inappropriate.
it
is
inappropriate
whatever
your
goal
is
to
jump
to
the
question
of
making
these
racial
discriminations
and
particularly
inappropriate
we
say,
particularly
inappropriate
we
say
because
the
thing
that
happens
is
that
it
keeps
mr.
bakke
out
of
medical
school
not
because
of
somebody
else's
race
or
anything
else
but
because
of
mr.
bakke's
race,
he
becomes
ineligible
himself
to
enter
the
medical
school
and
mr.
bakke's
individual
state
in
this
matter
is
an
important
state
and
i
started
with
the
proposition
that
i
am
mr.
bakke's
lawyer
and
mr.
bakke
is
my
client.
he
has
a
right
to
that
protection.
he
has
a
right.
he
desires
to
show
that
he
is
one
of
those
who
is
entitled
to
enter
that
medical
school
to
keep
him
out
because
of
his
race
we
submit
is
an
impropriety.
the
whole
point
--
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
yes,
he
did.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
yes,
he
did.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
most
respectfully,
the
argument
does
not
turn
on
the
numbers.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
yes,
i
would
make.
if
it
was
one
and
if
there
was
an
agreement
as
there
is
in
this
that
he
was
kept
out
by
his
race,
whether
it's
one,
100,
2
--
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
yes.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
we
don't
think
we
would
--
we'd
ever
get
to
that
point
within
any
--
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
the
numbers
are
not
important.
it
is
the
principle
of
keeping
a
man
out
because
of
his
race
that
is
important.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
that's
right.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
it
depends
on
which
way
you
look
at
the
problem.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
the
problem
--
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
if
i
may
finish.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
the
problem
is
--
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
they
certainly
have
the
rights
to
compete
to
--
they
have
the
right
to
compete,
they
have
the
right
to
equal
competition.
they
even
have
another
right
which
was
given
them
by
the
california
supreme
court.
they
have
the
right
to
compete
not
only
upon
the
basis
of
grades,
they
have
the
right
to
compete
upon
the
basis
of
disadvantaged.
the
fact
--
the
university
of
course
says
we
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
that.
if
we
can't
have
a
quota
then
there's
no
place
for
us
to
go.
bear
in
mind,
bear
in
mind
that
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
california
is
entirely
explicit
in
its
opinion.
it
says
we
are
not,
emphasized,
we
are
not
telling
the
california
--
the
university
of
california
medical
school
that
it
has
to
take
the
100
people
with
the
highest
point
grade
average
of
the
highest
mcat
scores
or
whatever
it
is.
the
selection
--
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
yes.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
our
argument
would
be
the
same
to
the
extent
--
to
the
extent
that
race
itself
was
the
crucial
matter
in
the
admission
situation.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
in
our
opinion
--
in
our
opinion,
at
this
point
in
the
california
situation,
with
the
rule
of
the
supreme
court
before
it,
supreme
court
of
california
that
race
itself
is
an
improper
ground
for
selection
or
rejection
for
the
medical
school.
now,
there
are
all
kind
of
other
factors
of
economic
and
educational
diversity.
we
have
no
quarrel
whatever
with
that.
the
problem
--
well,
the
problem
really
is
that
as
we
look
at
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
as
we
look
at
2000
(d),
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
it
is
race
itself,
it
is
the
discrimination
on
the
ground
of
race
itself
which
is
--
which
is
forbidden.
2000
(d)
just
for
as
the
matter
of
refreshment,
refreshing
says,
“no
person
in
the
united
states
shall
on
the
ground
of
race,
color
or
national
origin
be
excluded
from
participation
in,
be
denied
the
benefit
of,
or
be
subjected
to
discrimination
under
any
program
or
activity
receiving
federal
financial
assistance”
and
we
think
that
the
particular
scheme
to
the
extent
that
race
becomes
a
crucial
in
a
court
matter
certainly
flies
in
the
face
of
this.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
may
i
just
say
a
word
about
the
record
on
that.
the
record
on
that
as
i
have
indicated
is
that
when
mr.
bakke
filed
his
complaint
up
at
woodland,
he
listed
the
state
ground
and
the
statutory
ground
as
well
as
the
constitutional
ground.
number
two,
when
the
university
filed
its
cross-complaint
up
at
woodland,
it
listed
both
the
state
constitutional
ground
and
the
statutory
ground
as
part
of
its
declaratory
relief
point
three
when
judge
macar
(ph)
who
was
the
trial
judge
made
his
findings
and
conclusions
in
this
case,
his
conclusion
was
that
the
program
was
improper
both
--
not
only
under
the
constitutional
and
state
ground
but
also
under
2000
(d)
and
more
than
that
number
4,
the
very
judgment
in
this
case
as
it
exists
is
a
judgment,
is
a
judgment
that
a
--
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
on
all
of
those
grounds.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
there
were
all
--
there
were
all
probably
attention
to
the
supreme
court
of
california,
it
is
true
that
by
that
time,
the
university
had
written
a
brief
basically
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
it
is
true
that
the
california
court
ignored
and
elected
not
to.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
my
own
judgment
if
i
may
be
so
bold
is
that
that
becomes
almost
an
idle
act
because
if
the
basis
of
reversal
is
telling
the
california
court,
look
at
this
from
the
point
of
view
of
2000
(d)
or
look
at
this
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
of
the
california
constitution
then
and
i
say
this
respectfully
and
without
having
the
stature
to
make
this
statement,
i
say
respectfully
that
as
i
read
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
i
read
2000
(d),
it
seems
to
me
that
2000
(d)
is
even
stronger
than
any
--
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
yes.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
i'm
asking
this
court
to
decide.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
i
understand
that.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
we
believe
that
this
case
is
right
and
ready
for
decision
on
the
constitutional
ground
and
on
the
statutory
ground.
we
believe
that
what
we
have
here
--
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
i
understand
that
justice
brennan
and
i
am
--
i
am
not
at
any
point
in
this
argument
attempting
to
place
myself
where
i
do
not
belong
and
that
is
at
the
decision
making.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
i
am
asking
this
court
to
affirm
the
california
supreme
court
on
both
grounds
and
i
am
suggesting
to
the
court,
i
am
suggesting
to
the
court,
i
am
suggesting
to
the
court
that
the
california
supreme
court
had
before
it
as
have
been
indicated
by
mr.
cox
a
very
difficult
sensitive
issue
that
it
handled
it
in
a
very
pragmatic
and
a
very
practical
and
valuable
sense.
it
laid
down
no
harsh
rules.
it
required
no
one
to
discriminate.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
i've
heard
that
argument
made.
i
think
that
--
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
yes,
i've
heard
that
argument
made.
i
happen
to
believe
--
i
happen
to
believe
that
the
california
supreme
court
felt
that
it
was
on
perfectly
sound,
round
and
reaching
in
the
federal
constitution
and
that
that
is
the
way
the
case
ought
to
go.
i
of
course
was
not
a
party
to
their
other
deliberation.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
i
suppose
that
there
were
new
case
that
that
would
come
up.
the
fact
of
the
matter
was
that
california
has
a
system
that
the
court
probably
knows
where
the
constitution
of
california
can
be
amended
by
a
popular
plebiscite
and
that's
what
happened.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
that
amendment
to
the
california
constitution
occurred
approximately
a
month
after
the
california
supreme
court
decision
below
was
final.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
in
my
judgment,
the
use
of
race
as
a
basis
for
admission
to
a
medical
school
or
the
exercise
of
other
rights
is
an
improper
measure,
that
is
my
answer
to
the
question.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
whether
crucial
or
not
except
in
this
situation
and
that
is
to
the
extent,
to
the
extent
that
the
identification
of
race
may
give
further
inquiry
to
the
admissions
committee
as
to
whether
there
has
been
actual
disadvantaged
economic
educational
persecution
or
whatever
but
then
the
decision
is
to
be
made
on
those
factors
and
not
the
factor
of
race
itself.
that's
my
position
on
the
matter.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
that
was
--
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
i
think
that
was
the
answer
that
i
made.
i
think
that
that
was
the
answer
that
it
was
permissible
to
the
extent,
to
the
extent
that
it
gave
some
clue
to
the
admissions
committee
that
it
ought
to
consider
in
terms
of
this
individual
applicant
out
of
the
100
that
it
was
talking
about
whether
there
was
a
prior
history
of
economic,
educational
or
whatever
deprivation,
persecution
or
whatever
it
may
be.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
yes,
that's
our
argument.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
i
don't
think
i
said
that
because
i
know
of
no
record
that
there
was
an
explicit
approval
by
the
regents
of
this
system
at
the
day
it
was
--
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
oh!
yes.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
yes,
and
what
we
are
saying
in
that
regard
--
what
we
are
saying
in
that
regard
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
there
was
no
non-minority
person
in
any
of
the
years
covered
by
the
statistics
here
that
was
ever
admitted
to
the
special
admission
program.
there
was
no
definition
of
what
was
meant
by
educationally
or
economically
disadvantaged
and
what
i
said
before
and
i
repeat
now
is
that
in
the
very
two
years
that
mr.
bakke
applied,
there
were
245
people
who
were
deemed
by
the
school
to
be
white
economically
disadvantaged
who
tried
to
get
into
the
program,
more
than
a
third
of
those
who
tried
and
not
in.
and
i
also
called
to
the
court's
attention
one
other
fact,
that
in
the
year
1973
when
the
application
was
handed
out,
the
application
said,
are
you
applying
as
a
member
of
a
disadvantaged
group,
economically
or
educationally.
that
was
not
the
question
in
1974.
in
1974,
the
school
had
gone
to
the
mcat
system
which
is
the
general
application
system
used
by
half
the
medical
schools
in
the
united
states.
the
question
in
1974
which
triggered
consideration
by
the
special
admissions
group
was
this,
are
you
applying
as
a
member
of
a
minority
group?
so
on
its
face,
on
its
face
the
program
becomes
not
even
the
pretense
of
a
disadvantaged
group,
the
program
becomes
a
program
which
is
designed
as
a
racial
proposition
and
that
is
what
mr.
bakke
is
complaining
of,
it
is
that
which
deprives
mr.
bakke
of
his
full
opportunity
to
100
places
in
the
class.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
yes,
that
is
true.
there
was
not
only
a
stipulation
but
what
happened
was
that
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
california
decided
the
case.
it
had
--
it
decided
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
quota.
we
have
argued
back
and
forth
through
the
trial
court
and
through
the
supreme
court
the
question
of
burden
of
proof.
did
mr.
bakke
have
the
burden
of
proving
that
he
would
have
qualified
or
to
the
university
at
the
burden
of
proving
that
he
would
not
have
qualified?
the
original
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
california
was
a
decision
which
said
--
which
agreed
with
this
finding,
and
said,
yes
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
university.
it's
a
--
it's
a
--
just
like
franks
versus
bowman
transportation,
once
you
prove
the
discrimination,
then
the
university
has
to
prove
that
mr.
bakke
would
not
have
been
admitted
even
there
though
there
had
not
been
no
such
quota.
and
the
university
then
entered
into
a
petition
for
rehearing
and
in
the
petition
for
rehearing,
it
entered
into
a
stipulation
and
the
stipulation
is
filed
before
the
california
supreme
court
and
the
stipulation
is
very
brief,
very
brief.
it
is
hereby
stipulated
by
the
regents
of
the
university
of
california
(the
university)
that
it
has
produced
all
of
the
evidence
available
to
it.
on
the
question
of
whether
mr.
bakke's
failure
to
be
admitted
for
the
class
--
entering
the
school
of
medicine
at
the
university
of
california
davis
in
september
1973
resulted
from
the
operation
of
the
special
admissions
program.
the
university
concedes
that
it
cannot
the
meet
the
burden
of
proving,
the
special
admissions
program
did
not
result
in
mr.
bakke's
failure
to
be
admitted
and
without
your
taking
your
time,
i
will
tell
you
that
this
is
carried
over
to
the
petition
for
hearing,
the
stipulation
is
in
exhibit
to
it
and
then
the
california
--
the
university
says,
the
university
has
produced
all
of
the
evidence
it
has
on
the
question
and
concedes
as
set
forth
in
the
attacked
stipulation
of
donald
l.
reidhaar
that
it
will
not
attempt
to
meet
that
burden
of
proof.
mr.
bakke
was
a
highly
qualified
applicant
and
came
extremely
close
to
admission
in
1973
even
with
the
special
admissions
program
being
in
operation.
it
cannot
be
clearly
demonstrated
that
the
special
admission
program
did
not
operate
to
deny
mr.
bakke
admission
in
that
year
and
then
upon
receipt
of
the
petition
for
rehearing
with
the
stipulation
attached
to
it,
the
california
supreme
court
then
did
the
logical
thing
instead
of
remanding
the
matter
to
woodland
and
yolo
county
for
judge
macar
(ph)
to
make
this
determination
and
ordered
mr.
bakke
into
the
medical
school,
he
is
presently
ordered
into
the
medical
school
and
where
it
not
for
the
stay
in
this
case
of
course,
he
would
be
in
the
medical
school.
mr.
reynold
h.
colvin
thank
you
very
much.
