justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
cox,
what
if
davis
medical
school
had
decided
that
since
the
population
of
doctors
in
the
--
among
minority
population
of
doctors
in
california
was
so
small,
instead
of
setting
aside
16
seats
for
minority
doctors,
they
would
set
aside
50
seats
until
that
balance
were
redress
and
the
minority
population
of
doctors
equal
that
of
the
population
as
a
whole,
would
that
be
any
more
infirm
than
the
program
that
davis
has?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
cox
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
neither
not
--
neither
may
not
be
a
difference
in
fed
--
whether
we're
reviewing
a
federal
court
decision
and
a
state
court
decision
as
to
whether
the
statutory
question
should
be
decided
by
us,
1257
just
gives
us
jurisdiction
over
a
federal
question
in
which
a
decision
of
the
highest
court
of
a
status
been
had;
whereas
our
jurisdiction
on
certiorari
review
courts
of
appeals
judgment
as
anything
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
mccree
does
the
united
states
really
care
whether
the
decisions
made
by
the
faculty,
by
the
president
or
the
board
of
regents?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
it
would
be
any
different
if
it
have
been
made
by
the
board
of
regents
rather
than
by
the
faculty
or
by
the
legislature?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
does
this
record
lack
with
respect
to
asian-americans
that
it
has
with
respect
to
the
other
minorities
who
are
included
in
the
program?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
no
one
is
charging
you
with
laches
here,
mr.
colvin.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
colvin,
to
follow
up
a
minute
justice
powell's
question.
that
really
is
a
matter
of
characterization
rather
than
strictly
a
fact.
as
i
understand
it,
there
were
16
places
set
aside
for
minority
applicants
and
the
--
you're
certainly
free
to
argue
from
that
what
you
want
to
about
quotas
and
goals
but
that
really
goes
beyond
the
strict
factual
matter.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
colvin,
what
if
the
university
says,
“we
don't
want
to
just
aim
at
the
disadvantaged.
we
want
to
increase
the
number
of
black
doctors
who
are
practicing
in
california”
to
the
--
is
that
a
permissible
goal
on
the
part
of
the
university?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
do
you
say
then
that
it
is
not
a
permissible
goal
on
the
part
of
the
university
to
increase
the
number
of
black
doctors
practicing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
it's
a
permissible
goal,
why
on
earth
beat
around
the
bush?
why
not
simply
make
a
race-oriented
selection
process?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
university
comes
back
and
says
we're
not
interested
in
disadvantaged
as
such,
we're
interested
in
blacks.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
colvin,
my
brother
powell
a
moment
ago
asked
you
a
question
suggesting
that
a
university's
admission
policy
took
into
effect,
took
into
account
a
number
of
considerations,
one
of
which
was
race.
your
response
to
him
was
that
so
long
as
race
is
a
crucial
factor,
it's
bad
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
want
to
refine
that
question
but
suppose
the
question
where
race
is
taken
into
account
but
it
is
not
a
crucial
or
dispositive
factor
as
you
referred
to
it
in
your
answer
to
him,
is
that
permissible
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
whether
crucial
or
not.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
university
stipulated
after
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
california
didn't
that
it
could
not
sustain
the
burden
of
proof
and
if
he
would
have
not
been
admitted
under
a
different
system.
