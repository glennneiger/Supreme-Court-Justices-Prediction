yes,
it's

yes.

mr.

to

about

your

is
that
in

the
benchmark

were
only
a

that

in

special
program
was
loaded

justice

there's
a
record

and
so
as
it
operated.
it
had
the
effect
of
someone
with
a
higher
benchmark
rating
in
the
regular
program,
losing
a
place?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
university
of
california
through
its
special
admissions
policy
excluded
allan
bakke
from
participation
in
it's
program
of
medical
education
because
of
his
race.
the
chief
justice,
mr.
justice
stewart,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
i
are
of
the
opinion
that,
that
action
violated
title
vi
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
section
601
of
that
act
prohibits
the
exclusion
of
any
person
on
the
ground
of
race
from
any
program
receiving
federal
financial
assistance.
the
davis
medical
school
is
such
a
program.
the
language
of
the
statue
is
exceptionally
plain.
it
provides,
“no
person
in
the
united
states
shall,
on
the
ground
of
race,
color,
or
national
origin,
be
excluded
from
participation
in,
be
denied
the
benefits
of,
or
be
subjected
to
discrimination
under
any
program
or
activity
receiving
federal
financial
assistance.”
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
makes
it
clear
that
congress
meant
exactly
what
it
said.
during
the
lengthy
debates,
opponents
of
the
legislation
expressed
their
concern
that
the
act
would
be
read
as
mandating
racial
quotas
in
"racially
balanced"
colleges
and
universities.
in
response,
those
supporting
the
legislation
gave
repeated
assurances
that
the
act
would
be
colorblind
in
it's
application.
one
supporter
of
the
act
expressed
this
position
in
these
words,
“the
basic
fairness
of
title
vi
is
so
clear
that
i
find
it
difficult
to
understand
why
it
should
create
any
opposition.
private
prejudices,
to
be
sure,
cannot
be
eliminated
overnight.
however,
there
is
one
area
where
no
room
at
all
exists
for
private
prejudices,
that
is
the
area
of
governmental
conduct.
as
the
first
mr.
justice
harlan
said
in
his
prophetic
dissenting
opinion
in
plessy
against
ferguson,
“our
constitution
is
color-blind,
so
i
say
to
senators,
must
be
our
government.
title
vi
closes
the
gap
between
our
purposes
as
a
democracy
and
our
prejudices
as
individuals.
the
cuts
of
prejudice
need
healing.
the
costs
of
prejudice
need
understanding.
we
cannot
have
hostility
between
two
great
parts
of
our
people
without
tragic
loss
in
our
human
values.”
in
words
that
would
be
paraphrased
and
repeated
throughout
the
congressional
debates,
senator
pastore,
the
floor
manager
of
the
bill,
clearly
stated
the
intent
of
congress.
title
vi
will
guarantee
that
the
money
collected
by
colorblind
tax
collectors
will
be
distributed
by
federal
and
state
administrators
who
are
equally
colorblind.
we
cannot
ignore
the
plain
language
in
the
legislative
history
and
in
the
statute
itself.
the
simple
rule
set
forth
in
the
statute
is
not
qualified
by
any
words
that
say
in
substance
that
the
prohibition
against
racial
discrimination
shall
apply
only
if
the
racial
discrimination
is
also
unconstitutional.
in
order
to
interpret
this
unusually
clear
colorblind
statute,
there
is
no
need
to
decide
whether
the
constitution
is
also
colorblind.
in
other
provisions
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
the
court
has
held
that
the
statute
has
a
meaning
of
its
own
that
is
not
necessarily
congruent
with
any
constitutional
standard.
thus
for
example,
in
washington
against
davis,
an
employment
discrimination
case
arising
under
title
vii,
the
court
stated,
“we
have
never
held
that
the
constitutional
standard
for
adjudicating
claims
of
invidious
racial
discrimination
is
identical
to
the
standards
applicable
under
title
vii
and
we
decline
to
do
so
today.”
and
in
other
title
vii
cases,
the
court
has
also
squarely
held
that
the
statute
prohibits
racial
discrimination
against
white
petitioners
upon
the
same
standards
as
would
be
applicable
where
they
negroes.
quoting
from
our
earlier
decision
in
griggs
against
duke
power,
the
court
reaffirmed
the
principle
that
the
statute
prohibits
discriminatory
preference
for
any
racial
group,
minority
or
majority.
but
the
university
argues
that
regardless
of
the
principle
of
none-discrimination
established
by
title
vi,
an
individual
who
was
injured
by
a
violation
of
title
vi,
has
no
standing
litigate
his
claim
in
court.
this
contention
was
not
raised
until
oral
argument
before
us
and
has
been
repeatedly
and
consistently
rejected
in
cases
both
in
this
court
and
others
where
individuals
have
raised
claims
similar
to
bakke's.
in
the
context
of
this
case,
we
find
no
merit
in
the
argument
that
bakke
has
no
standing
to
a
assert
his
statutory
claim.
two
questions
remain,
first;
even
though
the
statutory
ground
to
decision
in
this
case
is
dispositive
is
it
appropriate
to
discuss
any
constitutional
issues
presented
by
the
case?
the
court
has
repeatedly
given
the
same
answer
to
this
question.
to
quote
only
one
such
answer
in
spector
motor
co.
against
mclaughlin,
“if
there
is
one
doctrine,
more
deeply
rooted
than
any
other
in
the
process
of
constitutional
adjudication,
it
is
that
we
ought
not
to
pass
on
questions
of
constitutionality
unless
such
adjudication
is
unavoidable."
the
more
important
the
issue,
the
more
force
there
is
to
this
doctrine.
in
our
view,
we
have
a
clear
duty
to
avoid
unnecessary
discussion
of
constitutional
questions.
finally,
should
the
court
volunteer
its
views
about
university
admissions
programs
other
than
the
one
which
resulted
in
the
rejection
of
bakke's
application.
again,
the
answer
is
plain.
it
is
well
settle
that
this
court
reviews
judgments
not
statements
and
opinions.
this
lawsuit
is
between
two
specific
litigants;
allan
bakke
and
the
regents
of
the
university
of
california.
the
judgment
now
before
us,
as
we
explain
in
our
opinion,
declares
that
the
university's
special
admissions
program
was
unlawful
and
orders
that
bakke
be
admitted
to
the
medical
school.
the
specific
holding
of
the
california
supreme
court
that
is
under
review
in
this
case
is
limited
to
the
conclusion
that
the
“special
admissions”
program
employed
by
that
university
was
unlawful.
no
other
issue
remains
in
the
case.
just
as
we
have
a
duty
to
decide
that
issue,
so
too
we
have
a
duty,
equally
strong
and
equally
ingrained
in
the
constitutional
structure
of
our
government,
to
avoid
discussion
of
important
issues
not
presented
by
the
controversy
before
us.
75
years
ago,
in
one
of
his
classic
dissenting
opinions,
mr.
justice
holmes
observed
that
in
great
cases,
the
interest
at
stake
generates
a
kind
of
hydraulic
pressure
which
makes
what
previously
was
clear
seem
doubtful
and
before
which
even
well
settled
principle
of
law
were
abandoned.
not
withstanding
the
pressures
that
tempt
us
to
speak
about
other
issues,
well
settled
principles
dictate
a
course
of
judicial
restrain.
for
these
reasons,
the
chief
justice,
mr.
justice
stewart,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
i
have
concluded
that
the
court
should
simply
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
california
supreme
court.
to
the
extent
that
the
court
today
purports
to
do
anything
else,
we
believe,
it
exceeds
it's
proper
judicial
role.
