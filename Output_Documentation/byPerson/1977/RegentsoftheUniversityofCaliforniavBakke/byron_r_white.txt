justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
perhaps
you
know
whether
the
title
vi
question
was
presented
to
the
california
supreme
court
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
to
the
--
in
the
california
supreme
court,
was
it
argued
in
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
presented
but
just
not
decided.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
for
purposes
of
this
argument
though,
you
don't
--
do
you
need
to
go
any
farther
than
to
assert
and
convince
somebody
that
he
was
deprived
of
an
opportunity
to
compete
for
one
of
the
six
teams
seats
because
of
his
race.
will
he
go
farther
than
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
don't
need
to
go
any
farther,
you
simply
are
taking
up
a
lot
of
your
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what's
your
response
to
the
assertion
of
the
university
that
it
was
entitled
to
have
a
special
program
and
take
race
into
account
and
that
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
there
was
no
barrier
to
it
doing
that
because
of
the
interest
that
were
involved.
now
what's
your
response
to
that
because
of
the
interest
that
was
involved?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
disagree
with
the
california
supreme
court
when
it
said
that
--
when
it
identified
the
interest
that
it
understood
the
university
was
taking
into
account
in
this
special
program
and
agreed
with
the
university's
submission
that
these
were
compelling
interests.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
agree
with
them
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
you
--
you
agree
that
--
you
don't
disagree
then
that
these
interests
they're
asserting
are
compelling
interests?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
agree
then
--
then
you
also
agree
that
if
they
are
compelling,
and
if
there
were
no
alternatives,
if
there
were
no
alternatives
that
the
fact
that
--
would
you
agree
that
the
racial
classification
could
be
upheld?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
--
part
of
your
submission
is
even
if
things
are
compelling
interests,
even
if
there
is
no
alternative,
use
of
the
racial
classification
is
unconstitutional.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
then
that
if
we
disagreed
with
you
that
that
racial
classification
is
invalid
even
if
there
are
compelling
interests
and
even
if
there's
no
alternative.
i
get
--
you
then
support
the
california
court's
conclusion
that
there
were
alternatives
in
fact.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
if
we
--
if
we
didn't
agree
with
the
california
supreme
court
on
the
federal
issue,
and
reverse
them,
i
take
it
you
would
pursue
the
other
grounds
that
you
had
in
the
california
supreme
court,
the
state
grounds
and
the
federal
statute
ground.
justice
byron
r.
white
on
all
those
grounds.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
where
those
grounds
all
taken
to
the
supreme
court
of
california?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
ignored
it
but
if
we
reverse
the
california
supreme
court
on
the
federal
--
on
the
ground
that
it
did
decide,
what
would
be
the
upshot
in
the
california
supreme
court?
i
suppose
that
the
other
issues
that
would
have
to
be
faced
then
in
the
california
supreme
court,
namely
the
federal
statutory
ground
and
the
state
constitutional
ground.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
it's
certainly
possible
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
wouldn't
--
might
permit
or
wouldn't
forbid
what
congress
could
forbid
in
the
statute
and
congress
has
often
done
that
and
it
--
technically,
it
could
be
that
that
the
civil
rights
act
forbids
things
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
itself
wouldn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
ask
you
one
more
question?
in
one
of
the
amicus
brief,
it
is
asserted
that
in
november
1976,
the
california
constitution
was
further
amended
to
say
that
no
person
shall
be
debarred
admission
to
any
department
of
the
university
on
the
count
of
race.
now,
that
has
--
that
of
course
isn't
the
case
but
i
suppose
that
would
come
up
in
the
case
if
it
were,
if
we
reverse
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
it
increase
--
if
taking
race
into
account
increases
a
person's
chance
of
getting
in,
it's
inevitable
whether
it's
going
to
be
crucial
at
some
point.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
at
any
point.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't
say
that
if
the
admissions
committee
suddenly
decided
that
they
wouldn't
admit
any
black
people.
