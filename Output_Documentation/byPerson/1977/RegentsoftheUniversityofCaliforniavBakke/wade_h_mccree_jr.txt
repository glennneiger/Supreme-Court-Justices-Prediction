mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
interest
of
the
united
states
of
america
is
amicus
curiae
stands
from
the
fact
that
the
congress
and
the
executive
branch
have
adopted
many
minority
sensitive
programs.
they
take
race
or
minority
status
into
account
in
order
to
achieve
the
goal
of
equal
opportunity.
the
united
states
is
also
concluded
that
voluntary
programs
to
increase
the
participation
of
minorities
in
activities
throughout
our
society.
activities
previously
close
to
them
should
be
encouraged
and
supported.
accordingly,
it
asks
this
court
to
reject
the
holding
of
the
supreme
court
of
california
if
race
or
other
minority
status
may
not
constitutionally
be
employed
in
affirmative
action
and
special
admissions
programs
properly
designed
and
tailored
to
eliminate
discrimination
against
racial
and
ethnic
minorities
as
such
discrimination
exist
today
or
to
help
overcome
the
effects
of
past
years
of
discriminations.
this
court
does
not
require
a
recital
of
the
extent
in
duration
of
racial
discrimination
in
america
from
the
time
it
was
enshrined
in
our
very
constitution
in
the
three-fifths
comprise,
in
the
fugitive
slave
provision
and
in
the
provision
preventing
the
importation
of
such
persons
prior
to1808.
and
it
continues
until
the
present
day
as
the
over
burden
dockets
of
the
lower
federal
courts
and
indeed
of
this
court
will
indicate
where
there's
been
non-compliance
with
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
it
rediscovered
and
are
still
rediscovering
the
true
genius
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
indeed,
many
children
born
in
1954,
when
brown
was
decided
are
today
23
years
later
the
very
persons
knocking
on
the
doors
of
professional
schools
seeking
admission
about
the
country
that
they
are
persons
who
in
many
instances
have
been
denied
the
fulfillment
of
the
promise
of
that
decision
because
of
resistance
to
this
court's
decision
that
was
such
a
landmark
when
it
was
handed
down.
and
this
discrimination
has
not
been
limited
just
to
persons
of
african
ancestry.
we
all
know
too
well
the
asian
exclusion
acts
that
have
discriminated
against
asian-american
citizens.
the
sad
history
of
our
native
american-indian
population
and
the
treatment
of
our
hispanic
population
sometimes
called
chicano.
this
is
what
prompts
the
interest
of
the
united
states
in
seeing
that
this
court
shall
overturn
the
ruling
of
the
california
supreme
court,
the
race
or
minority
status
may
not
be
taken
into
consideration
in
formulating
remedial
programs.
a
professor
zimmer
at
the
university
of
illinois
has
written,
if
the
ultimate
social
reality
is
the
irrelevancy
of
race,
the
present
reality
is
that
race
is
very
relevant.
accordingly,
it
would
be
appear
that
to
be
blind
to
race
today
is
to
be
blind
to
reality.
now
as
we've
argued
in
our
brief,
a
school
district
may
take
race
into
account
in
formulating
voluntary
plans
of
integration.
we've
argued
and
this
court
has
held
that
it
need
not
to
await
litigation
and
it
may
take
into
account
not
only
its
own
discrimination
but
also
the
consequences
of
discrimination
elsewhere
in
our
society
because
the
impact
of
discrimination
is
not
limited
by
source
or
locality.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
this
university
has
and
indeed,
i
would
be
surprised
to
have
found
it
in
according
to
the
state
of
this
record.
however,
this
court
is
aware
to
its
decisions
of
discrimination
in
the
state
of
california.
in
many
cases
involving
the
school
districts
of
los
angeles,
of
pasadena,
of
san
francisco
and
indeed,
there
is
census
data
revealing
that
about
40%
of
the
black
students
in
california
or
black
persons
of
school
age
in
california
grew
up
and
spent
harder
of
their
growing
years
in
states
where
there
was
de
jure
segregation.
until
it
was
stricken
down
in
1954
and
where
it
persisted
and
still
it
seems
to
elude
efforts
to
extra
pay
their
root
and
branch.
and
this
is
--
the
significance
of
my
statement
that
the
school
need
not
be
restricted
to
eliminating
the
effects
of
its
own
acts
of
discrimination
but
may
take
into
account
society's
discrimination
because
of
the
pervasiveness
of
its
impact.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
would
include
conduct
throughout
the
nation
because
we
are
the
nation
without
barriers
to
travel.
and
indeed
california
seems
to
have
been
--
seems
to
be
currently
one
of
the
principal
recipients
of
the
flow
of
population
from
other
parts
of
the
country.
and
many
of
them
bring
with
them
the
handicaps
imposed
upon
them
by
conditions
to
which
they
were
subjected
before
they
went
west.
we
suggest
that
it
is
not
enough
merely
to
look
at
the
visible
wounds
imposed
by
unconstitutional
discrimination
base
upon
race
or
ethnic
status
because
the
very
identification
of
race
or
ethnic
status
in
the
america
today
is
itself
a
handicap.
and
it
is
something
that
the
california
university
at
davis
medical
school
could
and
should
properly
consider
in
affording
a
remedy
to
correct
the
denial
of
racial
justice
in
this
nation.
and
we
submit
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
instead
of
outlawing
this.
indeed
should
welcome
it
as
part
of
its
intent
or
purpose.
there
were
limited
opportunities
for
professional
and
graduate
education
and
as
my
brother,
mr.
cox,
has
pointed
out.
there
is
a
problem
faced
by
every
school
which
has
to
apportion
scarcity
of
making
decisions
how
it
shall
employ
these
resources
and
united
states
submits
that
this
is
a
decision
best
left
to
the
professional
judgment
of
the
faculties
of
those
schools
so
long
as
this
apportionment
is
not
motivated
by
invidious
racial
purposes.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
the
united
states
should
not
care
about
that.
it
--
i
was
referring
to
that
facts
of
this
case
where
it
appears
that
it
was
made
by
the
faculty
there's
a
reference
to
a
faculty
resolution
which
unfortunately
does
not
appear
in
this
as
far
as
record.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
would
think
the
result
should
be
the
same,
your
honor.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
we
submit
that
a
remedy
is
intended
to
right
or
wrong.
and
we
think
that
the
court
should
scrutinize
the
use
of
race
to
make
certain
that
it
is
being
used
to
remedy
a
wrong
and
our
reference
to
asian-americans
here,
certainly
was
not
to
suggest
that
they
are
not
entitled
to
consideration
within
the
program,
but
just
to
indicate
that
the
sparseness
of
this
record
makes
it
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
determine
the
extent
of
continuing
--
the
continuing
impact
of
racial
discrimination
upon
that
segment
of
our
society.
if
i
may
continue
in
this
answer,
it
would
appear
that
the
asian-american
population
isn't
monolithic
anymore
than
any
other
categorical
segment
of
american
population.
and
certainly
in
addition
to
chinese
and
japanese,
there
are
korean,
philippine,
cambodian,
laotian,
indonesian,
and
the
impact
upon
these
varying
segments
is
not
known
and
doesn't
appear
from
the
record
except
where
we
make
a
reference,
i
believe
on
page
40
of
our
brief
to
some
census
statistics
concerning
you.
and
we
think
this
court
should
and
court
should
appropriately
make
certain
that
programs
that
have
a
racial
component
are
indeed
remedial
and
this
is
the
reason
for
the
suggestion
of
our
remand
because
of
the
state
of
this
particular
record.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well
among
other
things,
this
record
--
well,
it
isn't
so
much
the
record,
let
me
correct
that
answer,
is
it
is
available
data
in
the
form
of
statistics,
census
data
which
will
show
for
example
and
that
black
physicians
comprise
something
like
2.4
that's
an
approximation
of
all
the
physicians
that
the
native
american
figure,
i
believe,
is
less
than
1%
that
the
hispanic
or
chicano
figure
is
approximately
2%,
and
we
just
don't
know
the
impact
of
that
within
the
asian-american
community.
and
we
think
that
this
could
be
determined
if
it
was
sent
back
for
this
purpose.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
there
is
a
reference,
i
believe
its
page
42
of
my
brief
that
has
a
census
figure
that
has
a
grow
statement
of
the
number
of
professional
of
the
number
of
professional
persons
within
--
may
correct
that,
its
page
42
and
it
is
the
footnote
and
there's
a
reference.
29.1%
of
asia-american
persons
held
professional
managerial
and
administrative
positions
then
it
goes
on
to
speak
of
laboring
positions
and
so
forth.
but
there's
no
breakdown
in
this
professional
managerial
to
professional
and
particularly
including
medical
or
legal
practitioners.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
this
would
appear
to
be
so
but
it
would
be
significant
only
if
it
were
monolithic
community.
it
might
turn
out
that
among
koreans,
the
figure
was
less
than
one
or
two
percent
or
among
taiwanese
or
among
cambodians
or
laotians
and
at
such
a
generic
category
of
asian-americans
that
we
submit
that
this
is
something
that
a
court
might
want
to
look
at.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
on
this
record,
this
is
possible
but
we
know
how
sparse
this
record
is.
we
know
that
this
was
submitted
solely
on
declaration
of
dr.
lowrey
and
the
discovery
deposition
with
and
the
pleadings
was
no
testimony
taken
at
all
about
the
statistics
or
the
demographic
statistics
of
california.
and
the
interest
for
united
states
as
amicus
curiae
is
in
the
principle
that
there
may
be
remedial
voluntary
remedial
programs
that
are
race-conscious
minority
aware.
they
take
these
factors
into
consideration
in
order
fairly
to
evaluate
credentials
of
persons
who
may
have
suffered
from
this.
and
were
interested
in
having
this
principle
cleared
and
the
supreme
court
of
california
has
said
that
race
of
--
the
race
of
an
applicant
or
of
other
applicant
may
not
be
taken
into
consideration
for
any
purpose.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
believe
that
title
vi
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1969
states
no
principle,
no
substantive
principle
different
from
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
i
disagree
with
him
in
one
respect.
this
court
has
held
that
a
--
a
ground
not
urged
below
may
be
urged
here
in
support
of
a
judgment.
the
question
becomes
whether
it
is
urged
here.
there's
a
reference
to
it
in
the
reply
brief
of
respondents
whether
it
is
--
that
is
an
assertion
in
support
of
the
judgment
or
not
is
something
that
i
think
is
debatable.
i
would
like
to
argue
that
it
is
not,
that
it
is
a
passing
reference.
but
it
can
be
urged
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
he
may
and
unfortunately
he
follows
that.
i
would
like
to
conclude
that
undoubtedly
he
shall.
i
would
like
to
conclude
that
this
is
not
the
kind
of
case
that
should
be
decided
just
by
extrapolation
from
other
precedents
that
we
are
here
asking
the
court
to
give
us
the
full
dimensions
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
was
intended
to
afford
equal
protection
and
we
suggest
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
should
not
only
require
equality
of
treatment
but
should
also
permit
persons
who
were
held
back
to
be
brought
up
to
the
starting
line
where
the
opportunity
for
equality
will
be
meaningful
and
this
court
has
reasoned
on
other
occasions
to
challenges
like
this
because
we
will
never
forget
that
when
it
hears
the
real
cases.
it
is
a
constitution,
it
is
expounding.
thank
you.
