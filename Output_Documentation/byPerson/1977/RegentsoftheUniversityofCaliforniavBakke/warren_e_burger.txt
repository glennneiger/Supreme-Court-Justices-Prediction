mr.

you

you're
ready.

mr.

chief

e.

mr.
cox,
along
that
line
is
there
--
i
suppose
athletic
scholarships
are
largely
confined
if
not
entirely
confined
to
undergraduates
schools
largely
perhaps.
is
there
a
difference
between
the
problems
that
you're
presenting
with
respect
to
undergraduate
schools
and
professional
graduate
schools?
chief

e.

mr.

--

--
the
23%
that
or
if
you
haven't
finished
answering
mr.

brennan,
please

chief

go
ahead.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
please,
go
ahead.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
justice
powell
referred
to
a
figure
of
23%
minority
does
that
conclude
orientals
in
california?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
there
--
is
there
anything
--
is
there
specific
finding
in
this
record
that
orientals
as
one
identifiable
group
have
been
disadvantaged?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
what
particular
holdings
do
you
refer
to
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
terms
of
the
--
in
terms
of
the
professions
mr.
cox,
is
there
anything
in
this
record
to
show
that
there
are
nonetheless
substantial
number
of
orientals
in
medicine
and
teaching
in
the
law?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
probably
hire
them
and
in
any
of
the
other
categories.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
going
to
address
the
question
of
other
alternatives
mr.
cox?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
what
about
a
--
what
about
a
make
up?
what
about
an
additional
year
to
make
up
for
all
people
who
might
be
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
very
little
left
if
we've
taken
a
good
deal
of
your
time,
so
we'll
enlarge
your
time
five
minutes
and
enlarge
mr.
colvin's
time
accordingly.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'll
give
you
probably
about
seven
minutes
altogether.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general,
is
there
any
evidence
in
this
record
that
this
university
its
medical
school
at
davis
has
ever
engaged
in
any
exclusion
or
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
including
--
do
you
include
in
that
conduct
outside
the
state
of
california?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
record
show
the
number
of
the
doctors,
lawyers,
engineers
who
are
of
asian
ancestry
and
partial
asian
ancestry
in
california?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
29%
is
substantially
higher
than
their
proportion
of
the
total
population
is
that
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
on
its
face,
the
29%
hardly
would
support
any
ready
conclusion
that
there's
pervasive
discrimination
against
people
of
asian
ancestry,
is
that
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
solicitor
general.
mr.
colvin.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
colvin,
don't
get
too
far
away
from
the
microphone
if
you
want
to
stay
on
the
record.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
not
because
it's
limited
rigidly
to
16?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
do
you
mean
by
that
as
to
the
16
places,
the
allocation
was
dominantly
by
race?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
it's
arguable
that
the
california
supreme
court
should
have
decided
the
statutory
question
for
reaching
the
constitutional
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
think
it's
been
pressed
today
except
that
our
inquiries
are
aimed
at
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
you
had
argued
earlier
that
this
record
shows
that
race
--
this
was
your
argument
at
least
that
race
was
the
dispositive
factor
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
you
said,
i
think
the
regents
agreed
with
that.
i
think
you
said
also
the
regents
agreed
with
that
although
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
when
i
say
the
regents,
i
mean,
your
adversary.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
identifying
the
regents
as
such.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
is
now
expired,
mr.
colvin.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
cox,
do
you
have
something
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
76-811,
regents
of
the
university
of
california
against
bakke,
will
be
disposed
of
in
this
way.
mr.
justice
powell
will
announce
the
judgment
of
the
court.
there
is
no
opinion
of
the
court
supported
by
a
majority
and
accordingly
other
justices
will
state
their
dissenting
and
concurring
opinions
in
due
course,
following
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
