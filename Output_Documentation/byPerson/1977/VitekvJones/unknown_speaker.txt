unknown
speaker
may
he
be
detained
in
the
mental
hospital
beyond
what
would
be
the
expiration
of
this
term
of
imprisonment?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
though
you
can
transfer
a
prisoner
and
keep
him
in
the
mental
facility
during
his
prison
term
for
reasons
and
under
the
circumstances
that
you
could
not
get
him
committed
after
the
present
term
is
over?
unknown
speaker
do
you
mean
if
you
could
not
commit
a
person
out
on
the
street
you
could
not
transfer
one
of
these
prisoners
to
the
mental
facility?
unknown
speaker
during
the
prison
term
you
can
transfer
him
to
the
mental
facility
for
reasons
that
would
never
justify
putting
him
there
after
his
term
is
over?
unknown
speaker
well,
putting
it
the
same
way.
if
he
is
in
prison
you
may
transfer
him
for
reasons
which
perhaps
if
you
never
had
gone
to
prison
you
could
not
initially
commit
him?
unknown
speaker
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
that
is
just
a
question
of
treatment,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
but
he
cannot
go
back
if
he
wants
too.
he
can
be
detained
there
against
his
will
if
they
think
he
needs
treatment?
unknown
speaker
that
he
is
going
to
be
detained
somewhere
against
his
will
as
long
as
he
is
serving
a
sentence?
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
mean
it
could
have
habeas
corpus,
the
purpose
of
that
is
to
get
release
and
you
cannot
be
released?
unknown
speaker
do
you
state
habeas?
he
can
be
released
from
a
mental
hospital
and
sent
back
to
the
prison,
can
he?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
state
law
means
that
his
transfer
is
just
conditional
on
the
fact
of
a
finding
by
a
doctor
rather
on
the
truth
of
the
fact?
unknown
speaker
that
does
not
follow
an
adversary
proceeding
of
any
kind,
it
is
just
a
doctor
who
examined
him
and
--
unknown
speaker
mr.
attorney
general
is
jones
still
in
indiana?
unknown
speaker
is
mr.
jones
still
on
indiana?
unknown
speaker
is
he
getting
involuntary
medication
there,
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kammerlohr
you
did
not
mention
the
question
of
mootness.
are
you
going
to
rely
on
your
brief
for
that?
unknown
speaker
where
he
is
now
at
danville,
illinois?
unknown
speaker
you
would
base
through
on
the
need
of
treatment
rather
than
on
the
need
to
segregate
that
the
rule
did
not
come
about
because
of
any
decision
by
the
present
administrators
that
once
it
has
determined
that
a
person
is
mentally
ill
that
he
may
be
disruptive
or
that
he
should
be
separated
from
the
prison
population,
you
want
to
transfer
him
for
treatment,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
not
on
the
notion
that
you
want
to
segregate
him?
unknown
speaker
so
you
are
not
relying
on
the
fact
that
a
mentally
ill
patient
kept
in
a
penal
complex
might
be
a
burden
on
the
other
inmates
at
all?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
you
just
(voice
overlap)
unknown
speaker
it
would
not
satisfy
the
prison
authorities
just
to
have
him
insulated
or
have
him
segregated
from
the
other
prisoners,
you
want
to
transfer
him
for
treatment?
unknown
speaker
once
they
send
him
over
there,
unless
the
hospitals
thinks
he
is
ready
to
come
back
the
prison
authorities
cannot
demand
that
he
come
back?
unknown
speaker
but
the
warden
of
the
prison
has
not
any
power
under
the
statute.
i
understand
that
to
say
to
the
mental
hospital,
please
send
this
man
back
even
though
you
think
he
needs
treatment?
i
take
it
that
is
the
decision
of
the
mental
hospital?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kammerlohr
you
and
your
colleague
mr.
wurtz
both
apparently
agree
that
the
case
is
not
moot
as
i
read
your
non
printed
briefs.
how
did
the
question
of
mootness
get
into
this
case?
did
the
court
asked
--
unknown
speaker
because
that
issue
is
the
right
to
transfer
at
all
in
this
case?
are
we
to
judge
this
case
on
the
assumption
that
this
state
had
the
power
to
transfer
him
if
they
went
through
the
right
procedures?
unknown
speaker
how
about
your
position?
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
what
i
asked
you.
let
us
just
suppose
the
state
now
gives
up
all
the
procedures
that
the
lower
court
afforded.
is
the
procedural
due
process
issue
is
the
only
one
that
is
here?
unknown
speaker
so
we
judge
it
on
the
assumption
that
as
long
as
due
process
was
satisfied
the
state
had
the
right
to
transfer
him,
so
that
we
have
not
got
the
issue
in
the
case
that
you
were
just
talking
about,
the
right
to
refuse
treatment?
unknown
speaker
that
is
just
for
the
purposes
of
treatment?
unknown
speaker
is
that
what
the
statute
provides?
unknown
speaker
there
is
a
lot
of
confusion
here
i
think
as
to
what
the
issue
is
what
and
perhaps
that
we
would
be
clarified
if
you
could
say
what
would
be
the
issues
at
the
hearing?
unknown
speaker
the
issue
is
then
you
say
would
be
whether
or
not
he
is
not
mentally
and
if
so
if
he
is
a
danger
to
himself
and
others.
then
if
the
finding
after
a
full
due
process
hearing
with
counsel
is
that
yes
he
is
mentally
ill
and
yes
he
is
a
danger
to
himself
and
others,
upon
that
finding
do
you
then
concede
that
he
could
be
transferred
against
his
will
to
a
mental
hospital
for
involuntary
treatment?
unknown
speaker
you
do,
well
i
think
that
clarifies.
this
is
why
i
thought
it
was.
unknown
speaker
the
statute
does
not
require
any
finding
that
is
a
danger
to
himself
and
others?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
why
do
you
put
that
in.
i
thought
you
had
said
a
moment
ago
that
this
issue
was,
we
really
were
not
dealing
with
that
issue
that
we
just
assume
that
if
the
procedure
is
right
he
could
be
transferred
regardless
of
what
the
subsequent
findings
are?
unknown
speaker
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
say
you
had
to
find
that
he
was
a
danger
to
himself
or
other?
unknown
speaker
that
makes
it
a
different
issue,
a
different
case
if
that
is
what
the
issue
is,
but
as
i
understand
it
now
that
is
not
your
contention.
as
i
understand
it
now
it
would
have
been
a
irrelevant
plain
in
this
due
process
hearing
or
is
represented
by
counsel
for
him
to
say
i
am
christian
scientist
and
i
do
not
believe
in
any
kind
of
administration
of
drugs
into
my
body,
correct?
do
i
understand
that
correctly?
unknown
speaker
because
that
is
what
the
issue
is
here?
you
answered
the
question
a
while
ago
and
said
the
issue
was
not
here.
that
issue
was
not
here
at
all.
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
feel
that
we
are
getting
away
in
maturing
in
our
concepts
of
psychiatric
treatment
as
contrasted
to
20
years
ago?
unknown
speaker
getting
away
from
the
old
stigmatizing
approach,
do
you
still
think
there
is
a
stigma
to
be
subjected
to
psychiatric
treatment?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
if
someone
undergoes
psychoanalysis
that
he
is
stigmatized?
unknown
speaker
be
careful
how
you
answer
that?
unknown
speaker
those
are
not
ordinary
hospital,
you
can
be
strapped
down
and
injected
the
things
that
you
do
not
like
to
remember?
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
show
that
his
treatment
at
danville
is
any
different
from
what
he
would
have
had
at
the
lincoln
regional
center?
unknown
speaker
but
you
are
taking
the
position
of
medication
he
received
in
danville
was
somehow
different
from
medication
he
would
receive
in
lincoln?
unknown
speaker
neither
one
of
you
want
it
moot,
but
we
have
to
struggle
with
this
and
i
do
not
think
you
can
stick
the
case
out
on
the
grounds
of
this
ruling.
unknown
speaker
one
more
question,
if
you
prevail
in
this
litigation,
your
client
will
stay
right
there
in
the
veterans
hospital
in
illinois,
will
he
not?
unknown
speaker
if
he
does
not
violate
his
parole?
unknown
speaker
so
it
does
not
have
any
effect
on
you.
i
still
have
not
understood
this
mootness
business,
but
it
is
too
bad
because
there
is
not
adversary
in
our
relationship?
unknown
speaker
as
well
as
your
opponent,
you
both
want
to
get
it
decided
even
if
it
is
moot?
unknown
speaker
maybe
the
constitution
guarantees
that
a
state
cannot
lock
anybody
up
involuntarily
in
a
hospital
who
is
neither
ill
nor
in
need
of
treatment
or
diagnosis?
unknown
speaker
it
would
determine
as
whether
he
needs
a
hearing
before
that
the
termination
is
made
or
could
i
say
have
my
law
clerk
make
that
determination
if
i
were
a
trial
judge?
