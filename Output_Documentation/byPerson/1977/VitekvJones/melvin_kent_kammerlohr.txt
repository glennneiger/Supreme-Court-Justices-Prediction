mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
the
court
knows
this
case
involves
the
broad
question
of
the
transfer
of
a
penal
complex
inmate
to
a
state
mental
hospital
we
are
now
and
encompassed
probably
within
that
question
is
the
constitutionality
of
nebraska
statute,
which
provides
generally
that
upon
a
finding
by
physician
or
psychologist
appointed
by
the
director
of
corrections
that
an
inmate
has
a
mental
defect
or
suffering
from
mental
defect
that
he
may
and
it
also
the
opinion
of
this
physician
or
psychologist
that
he
cannot
be
properly
treated
in
a
penal
institution
which
is
in
there,
the
director
may
transfer
him
to
a
state
mental
hospital.
it
also
provides
and
i
think
one
of
the
things
the
lower
court
overlooked
was
that
the
transfer
is
for
examination,
study
and
treatment
and
the
state
mental
hospital
has
the
duty
to
send
the
inmate
back
when
treatment
is
no
longer
necessary.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
no
your
honor.
number
one
he
may
not
be
detained
beyond
what
is
necessary
for
treatment
and
number
two,
if
two
psychiatrists,
when
his
prison
term
expires,
if
two
psychiatrists
find
that
he
should
be
retained
then
they
must
file
and
see
that
he
gets
the
same
mental
health
commitment
that
the
person
is
on
the
outside.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
civil
commitment,
yes
your
honor,
the
same
one.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
no,
your
honor
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
i
see
what
you
mean.
i
thought
you
meant
after
the
term
had
expired
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
possibly.
it
is
strictly
according
to
the
statute
on
the
opinion
of
the
physician
or
a
psychologist.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
yes
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
for
examination,
study
and
treatment,
but
on
the
other
hand
the
receivers
at
the
same
mental
hospital
must
then
are
mere
bound
by
statute
to
transfer
him
back
if
he
should
not
have
treatment.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
yes
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
yes,
he
going
to
be
detained
some
place.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
any
kind
of
physical
your
honor,
they
do
the
same
thing,
they
either
transfer
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
any
illness,
they
treat
him
if
they
can
at
the
penal
institution,
if
they
cannot,
they
take
them
in
the
city
of
lincoln
in
a
private
hospital
usually
and
in
this
projected
case
for
example
the
appellee
jones
burned
himself,
lit
a
mattress
while
he
is
in
solitary
confinement,
burned
himself
very
badly
and
was
taken
in
emergency
to
a
private
hospital,
saint
elizabeth
hospital
in
lincoln
and
remained
there
in
their
burn
unit,
they
have
a
special
burning
unit
for
five
months
with
his
condition
of
very
bad
burns.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
my
argument
runs
this
way
that
your
honor
those
things
should
be
properly
attacked
on
a
question
of
the
conditions
of
confinement,
the
constitutionality
of
the
conditions
and
that
having
a
commitment
procedure
such
as
the
lower
court
tried
to
design
here
is
not
even
going
to
come
closer
reaching
the
problem
because
of
the
variety
and
availability
and
quality
of
the
facilities
all
over
the
united
states
and
they
try
to
make
one
blanket
gruel
of
commitment
does
not
reach
the
problem,
that
those
things
ought
to
be
looked
into
which
they
are
all
the
time
in
42
usa
1983
civil
rights
cases.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
yes
your
honor.
they
could
bring
habeas
corpus
or
civil
right
action
on
the
conditions
and
test
out
whether
that
decision
is
proper.
these
are
medical
decisions
and
i
think
one
place
people
get,
maybe
we
get
off
a
little
bit
is
presuming
that
the
healthcare
professionals
are
not
going
to
act
properly
or
that
the
penal
officials
are
not
going
to
act
properly.
i
do
not
think
we
can
presume
that
in
this
type
of
case.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
he
can
be
released
from
the
type
of
confinement
that
he
was
under
confinement.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
i
believe
there
would
be
an
action
maybe
it
would
be
mandamus
or
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
i
do
not
believe
so
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
i
think
in
federal
habeas
or
federal
civil
rights
action
that
anything
could
be
done.
we
have,
as
this
court
well
knows,
we
have
been
involved
in
civil
rights
action
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
care
and
treatment
in
mental
health
facilities
and
mentally
retarded
facilities
and
the
prisons.
unfortunately,
none
of
these
cases
have
reached
this
court
yet,
but
the
federal
district
courts
are
setting
up
all
kinds
of
guidelines
and
rules
that
these
facilities
must
follow
and
it
seems
to
be
that
that
would
be
if
the
court
said
you
can,
you
may
or
may
not
give
insulin
shock
treatment
unless
you
do
those
and
so
i
think
that
could
all
be
done
under
a
proper
ruling
of
the
civil
rights
action.
if
i
backed
up
as
the
posture
of
this
case,
i
filed
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
this
action
was
brought
that
the
nebraska
statute
for
transfer
was
unconstitutional
on
this
face
and
i
filed
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
which
was
overruled.
i
think
under
of
the
court
should
have,
there
was
no
allegation
that
the
state
had
not
followed
that
statute
and
it
seems
to
me
that
under
meachum
v.
fano
and
montanye
v.
haymes,
the
question
is
does
the
transfer
to
a
mental
hospital
comes
within
those
two
cases?
does
he
have
some
right
or
some
liberty
interest
which
had
not
been
extinguished
at
the
trial?
the
lower
court
did
not
directly
face
that
issue.
the
lower
court
said
that
the
nebraska
statute
gave
him
an
expectation
within
the
exception
to
meachum
and
montanye,
but
they
did
not
say,
they
did
not
then
refer
to
the
method
of
the
transfer.
they
merely
said
this
is
an
exception
to
montanye
and
meachum,
and
therefore,
he
is
entitled
to
due
process
hearing.
we
say
the
whole
statute
is
what
was
conferred.
if
you
have
to
rely
on
state
law
what
was
conferred
was
that
he
maybe
transferred
or
may
not
if
you
want
to
take
the
negative
unless
a
physician
finds
that
he
should
be
and
this
law
happened.
there
is
no
allegation
that
this
had
not
happen,
so
therefore,
it
is
no
longer
exception
to
meachum
and
we
have
to
go
back
to
meachum
and
do
we
want
extend
meachum
that
far.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
that
is
correct
your
honor.
i
think
that
everything
that
was
conferred
by
statute
has
been
followed
so
then
on
that
the
question
is
should
meachum
include
transfer
to
a
mental
hospital,
the
same
that
includes
transfer
to
other
type
of
penal
facilities
when
this
is
within
the
contemplation
of
the
sentence
and
it
is
certainly
was
within
the
contemplation
of
the
sentence
that
a
person
may
go
to
some
kind
of
a
hospital,
all
of
our
statutes
are
included
of
course
and
they
are
very
broad
to
the
director
of
corrections
what
he
may
do
with
various
prison
inmates?
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
i
am
sure
they
must.
they
have
prison
physician.
this
is
another
thing
that
is
wrong.
it
seems
to
me
with
attacking
that
is
the
problem
on
the
transfer
of
due
process
proceeding
is
that
it
does
not
apply
to
treatment
within
the
penal
institutions.
it
only
applies
to
transfers
to
the
state
hospital.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
no,
your
honor
nor
to
maybe
some
treatment
for
a
venereal
disease
which
also
can
do
that
thing.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
i
am
not
sure
your
honor,
but
if
you
had
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
that
is
true.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
but
i
think
that
the
interest
we
all
have
is,
suppose
it
were
a
heart
operation
or
a
tumor
operation
for
brain
tumor,
we
are
all
interested
in
seeing
and
getting
the
best
diagnosis.
i
think
even
the
inmate
also
knows
do
i
really
need
this.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
he
is
not
going
to
cooperate
with
just
having
the
operation.
he
is
going
cooperate
with
having
the
diagnosis
and
i
say
that
is
what
we
are
trying
to
do
here.
we
want
to
send
them
over
for
diagnosis.
if
their
diagnosis
is
not
meet
we
will
send
them
back.
it
seems
to
me
it
is
a
medical
problem
and
that
this
due
process
here
is
not
going
to
gain
anything
when
you
have
a
prison
guard
or
someone
sitting
as
the
hearing
officer
and
we
get
involved
in
a
adversary
proceeding
similar
to
trying
to
determine
whether
a
criminal
defendant
knows
right
from
wrong
or
not
and
the
state
gets
their
psychiatrist
and
the
defendant
gets
his
psychiatrist
and
they
have
a
knock
down
drag
out
on
the
question
of
mentally
ill
or
not,
we
are
not
going
to
gain
anything
and
we
have
to
go
and
plus
the
court
here
said
that
he
is
entitled
counsel
so
we
have
to
get
involved
in
that
sort
of
thing
and
all
the
place
and
i
say
so
if
you
get
involved
in
that
so
rather
than
relying
upon
our
doctors
i
do
not
think
it
is
going
to
reach
the
problem
and
it
does
not
reach
it
on
in
house
treatment
at
all.
some
of
these
facilities
have
hospitals
even
and
it
does
not
apply
to
them.
some
of
them
have
clinics
and
everything
to
handle
mental
patients.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
pardon
me
your
honor
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
yes
and
mr.
jones
is
presently
in
danville,
illinois
your
honor,
veterans
hospital.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
well,
he
agreed
to
go
over
there
on
his
limited
parole,
so
i
assume
that
anything
he
gets
there
is
voluntary.
however,
on
that
particular
part
he
has
four
or
five
years
to
run
and
i
assume
that
he
may
violate
or
be
sent
back
to
nebraska
at
anytime
and
we
will
be
back
to
the
same
problem
again.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
except
that
i
was
just
referring
with
mr.
justice
blackmun
on
that.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
that
he
may
come
back.
he
has
four
or
five
years
left
on
his
sentence
and
that
this
issue,
after
this
particular
appellee
could
arise
at
any
time.
i
think
its
different
than
the
cases
this
court
has
had
on
the
question
pre-parole
hearing
that
sort
of
thing
because
once
the
parole
is
given
that
settles
it
for
that
issue
and
this
parole
here
was
actually
very
limited
for
the
purpose
of
mental
treatment
which
probably
was
instigated
by
what
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
for
diagnosis
and
treatment
if
necessary.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
no
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
yes,
i
am
relying
on
that
also
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
the
penal
did
not
want
to
segregate
him
and
this
is
a
thing.
if
he
is
segregated
in
the
field
institution
this
lower
court
does
not
apply
the
requirement
of
a
hearing
and
that
is
the
one
thing
i
am
saying
is
wrong
with
that
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
yes
your
honor,
primarily.
in
our
particular
instance
because
although
at
the
time
of
this
hearing
there
was
psychiatrist
and
now
there
is
no
longer
a
psychiatrist
even
working
in
the
prison.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
it
is
a
state
institution.
the
directors
are
appointed
by
the
governor
of
both
departments,
the
statute
authorizes
it
and
the
statute
also
requires
and
send
them
back.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
no
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
no,
i
do
not
believe
they
could
your
honor.
although,
the
statute
specifically
leaves
that
in
the
custody
of
the
prison
authorities
while
he
is
there
so
possibly
they
could.
the
statute
does
say
that
they
remain
legally
in
the
custody
of
the
prison
authorities
not
the
mental
hospital.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
well,
i
would
think
so,
it
should
be.
however,
i
do
not
how
the
statute
if
the
prison
authority
said
we
are
going
to
send
you
to
a
different
mental
hospital
that
they
could
not
get
him
back.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
that
is
right
your
honor.
that
is
what
i
understand
and
also
we
have
another
statute
section
83-109,
which
requires,
i
should
have
included
in
here,
but
it
is
already
in
here,
but
it
also
required
on
the
last
statute
that
a
personnel
of
public
institutions
in
any
case
relating
to
civilians
or
anybody
else
when
the
superintendent
of
any
facility
leaves
someone
as
improperly
in
that
facility,
he
has
a
duty
immediately
to
notify
the
director
of
the
department
and
have
him
transferred
to
a
proper
facility
or
discharged
and
so
the
recipients
here
do
have
statutory
requirements
as
far
as
not
holding
someone
as
in
these
horrible
cases
used
to
come
up
and
some
of
them
languishes
for
years
in
some
places,
it
should
not
be,
this
is
not
a
problem
anymore,
it
should
not
be.
and
if
it
is
it
should
come
under
a
civil
rights
case,
where
that
can
all
be
looked
into
it
that
these
facts
were
not
even
brought
out
particularly
in
this
case.
at
least
i
claim,
they
should
not
have
been
brought
out
under
the
most
for
summary
judgment.
thank
you
your
honors.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
someone
from
the
court
asked
us
to
prepare
our
type
written
brief
on
mootness.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
i
would
just
like
to
get
on
track
and
summarize
your
honor.
i
think
the
issue
here
is
the
interest
involved
whether
or
not
after
a
person
has
been
convicted
and
sentenced
such
as
in
meachum
and
others
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
yes
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
no
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
yes
your
honor,
i
think
so.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
they
might,
but
assuming
i
know
what
mr.
justice
stevens
is
getting
at
his
dissent
as
whether
or
not
there
is
a
residual
after
the
conviction,
any
residual
rights
such
as
right
to
religious
study
and
right
to
regional
medical
treatment
and
those
things
and
as
to
that
your
honor,
i
am
saying
even
if
there
is
a
residual
that
the
method
in
this
statute
satisfies
rather
than
this
hearing
that
lower
court
tried
to
outline.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
it
is
not
my
position
that
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
it
is
my
position
that
the
way
to
attack
that
then
comes
later
and
it
is
the
same
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
i
do
not
believe
he
could
be
sentenced
for
a
death
in
a
term
or
term
in
the
mental
hospital
if
you
were
then
found
after
you
arrived
there
that
he
was
not
mentally
ill,
i
think
he
could
be
sent
there
the
same
as
these
prison
for
examination
study
and
treatment
if
necessary.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
in
constitution,
the
only
thing
that
we
have
gotten
so
far
as
far
as
this
court
is
concerned
that
i
can
recall
is
reasonable
medical
treatment.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
so
that
when
we
do
this
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
you
do
not
need
a
hearing
before
(inaudible)
made
to
send
a
person
even
before
he
is
convicted
to
the
mental
hospital
to
see
if
he
is
able
to
stand
trial
or
one
example
and
while
he
is
there
he
is
usually
involuntary
confined
for
a
period
of
time
until
the
doctors
can
examine
and
determine
and
make
recommendation
back
to
court
and
i
assume
that
constitution
says
as
this
court
has
said
that
had
to
be
done.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
that
is
not
my
position
your
honor,
100%.
i
am
saying
if
this
court
finds
there
is
a
residual
that
the
nebraska’s
method
of
doing
it
is
constitutional
and
that
the
court
should
not
have
looked
into
whether
any
process
was
due
in
the
first
place,
but
if
they
did
that
they
should
have
found
that
our
method
was
a
more
reasonable
method
than
having
this
hearing,
that
is
my
total
position.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
yes
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
my
first
position,
i
do
not
think
is
a
strong
case
as
meachum
v.
fano
and
montanye,
but
i
do
believe
that
this
court
could
put
it
within
the
framework
of
those
cases.
thank
you
your
honors.
