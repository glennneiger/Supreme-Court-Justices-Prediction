justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
makes
the
case
moot?
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
kammerlohr,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
on
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
during
a
criminal
trial
the
trial
judge
knew
quite
a
bit
about
psychiatry
and
at
the
end
or
maybe
even
a
medical
psychiatrist
and
at
the
end
of
the
trial
the
trial
judge
said
well
i
have
heard
all
the
evidence
and
instead
of
sentencing
you
to
the
prison
i
talked
to
my
law
clerk
and
we
have
decided
it
would
be
better
for
you
to
go
the
mental
hospital,
could
he
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not?
constitutionally,
could
he
do
it
assume
the
statute
authorized
that.
the
trial
judge
can
have
discretion
without
any
hearing
on
mental
competence
to
send
either
to
a
prison
or
a
mental
hospital,
will
the
constitution
tolerate
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
do
not
have
to
be
concerned
about
the
method
in
this
statute.
we
must
first
decide
whether
the
convicted
person
has
any
protected
constitutional
interest
in
not
being
sent
to
a
mental
institution.
we
do
not
reach
the
statute
till
we
first
decide
that
and
as
i
understand
your
position,
the
state
can
have
the
trial
judge
without
any
hearing
whatsoever
decide
i
think
i
will
send
you
to
a
mental
hospital
instead
of
the
prison
because
i
think
it
would
be
better
for
you.
i
have
watched
you
during
the
trial.
i
think
you
would
be
probably
be
better
off
over
there
where
they
give
you
these
very
special
treatment.
that
is
your
position,
i
take
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
do
not
have
to
worry
about
the
adequacy
of
the
hearing
at
all
because
there
is
no
constitutionally
protected
interest
in
not
being
sent
to
a
mental
institution
as
opposed
to
another
prison?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
matter
of
grace
by
the
state.
it
gives
whatever
protection
it
wants
to
but
the
constitution
does
not
afford
any
protection,
that
is
your
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
does
the
constitution
guarantee
him
a
hearing
after
he
gets
to
the
mental
institution
or
is
that
just
a
matter
grace
given
by
the
state?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
question
is
what
does
the
constitution
require?
as
i
understand
your
position
that
he
has
been
convictive
of
crime,
constitution
does
not
require
anything,
he
can
go
wherever
the
trial
judge
sends
him?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
real
position
is
that
even
if
there
is
a
liberty
interest
you
do
give
adequate
procedures?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
your
secondary.
your
first
position
you
really
do
not
have
a
lot
of
confidence?
