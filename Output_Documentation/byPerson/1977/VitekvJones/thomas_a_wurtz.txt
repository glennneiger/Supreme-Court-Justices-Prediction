mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
address
my
argument
first
of
all
to
the
issue
of
mootness.
i
last
spoke
with
larry
jones
approximately
three
and
half
to
four
weeks
ago.
he
indicated
to
me
that
time
that
he
was
still
incarcerated
at
the
danville,
illinois
veterans
hospital.
he
is
in
a
locked
security
ward.
i
posed
to
him
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
he
is
receiving
medication,
whether
or
not
this
is
voluntary
or
involuntary.
he
indicated
that
he
was
taking
the
medication
that
was
prescribed
for
him
voluntarily.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
yes
your
honor.
i
think
because
of
the
very
limited
nature
of
the
parole
that
was
given
to
mr.
jones.
he
was
not
given
a
parole
in
which
he
could
go
out
and
live
in
society
or
he
could
not
seek
a
job.
he
was
told
to
go
strictly
to
the
mental
hospital
and
to
abide
by
that.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
condition
of
his
parole,
but
if
he
should
choose
to
violate
that,
he
would
be
back
in
the
state
of
nebraska.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
that
is
correct
your
honor,
but
also
if
he
were
to
probably
not
take
his
medication,
i
would
suggest
that
he
would
probably
come
back
to
the
state
of
nebraska
also.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
i
have
no
knowledge
of
that.
it
does
not
appear
on
the
record.
of
course,
he
was
transferred
there
after
the
hearing
was
concluded,
but
i
have
knowledge
of
that.
that
is
not
one
of
our
contentions.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
somewhat
your
honor.
i
think
inherent
in
being
treated
by
a
psychiatrist,
many
psychiatrists
feel
that
you
have
to
agree
with
their
diagnosis
and
go
along
with
their
prescription
or
they
cannot
do
anything
with
you.
i
think
if
you
would
not
want
to
take
his
medication
the
psychiatrist
there
on
that
wing
of
veterans
hospital
would
probably
send
him
back
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
i
would
suggest
your
honor
that
one
has
an
inherent
right
to
refuse
medical
treatment
whether
he
would
be
a
civilian
walking
around
the
street
or
whether
he
would
be
in
prison.
it
is
different
when
you
are
talking
about
refusing
medication
because
once
you
give
the
state
the
power
to
transfer
someone
from
a
penal
complex
to
a
mental
institution
as
we
see
in
a
record
here
you
give
the
psychiatrist
the
power
to
place
that
person
on
medication,
which
they
cannot
refuse
to
take.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
who
would
be
administering
this
experimental
drug?
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
i
would
say
that
the
patient
will
have
the
right
not
to
take
it.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
most
people
would
not,
but
i
think
they
would
have
the
right
to.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
we
do
not
need
a
hearing
for
that
because
i
think
there
is
a
right
--
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
i
think
he
should
have
that
right
not
to
submit
to
the
surgery
and
his
incarceration
should
not
make
any
difference.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
that
is
what
the
state
is
contending.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
my
position
is
that
the
court
was
correct,
the
lower
court
in
finding
that
statute
83-180
unconstitutional.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
yes
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
that
is
correct
your
honor.
i
would
feel
that
if
larry
jones
would
been
give
any
hearing
and
would
been
able
to
a
come
forward
with
psychiatric
testimony
of
his
own
at
a
hearing
to
show
the
state
of
nebraska
that
he
does
not
feel
that
he
was
in
need
of
psychiatric
care
and
there
was
a
hearing
and
he
could
present
evidences
to
that,
he
could
have
attorney
and
there
was
a
finding
by
an
independent
decision
maker
that
he
was
mentally
ill,
i
think
then
the
state
should
be
able
to
transfer
him
to
the
lincoln
regional
center
for
limited
duration,
for
the
confinement
during
the
period
for
which
he
was
incarcerated,
in
this
case
three
to
nine
years.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
just
for
the
purposes
of
treatment.
he
is
confined
though
when
is
treated.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
beating
up
everyone
where
your
honor?
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
yes
your
honor.
it
is
kind
of
what
happened.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
would
i
represent
him?
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
yes
your
honor,
i
would.
as
the
fact
of
matter
it
would
probably
be
a
short
hearing
and
maybe
(voice
overlap)
may
speak
itself
when
he
is
right
there,
but
i
still
think
that
the
transfer
to
the
psychiatric
hospital
is
so
important.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
it
is
not
unreasonable
your
honor
to
draw
that
inference.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
it
was
a
prima
facie
case
because
there
was
no
one
to
make
the
case
too
is
my
point.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
the
testimony
of
larry
jones
was
that
he
set
his
mattress
on
fire
so
that
he
may
be
moved
up
to
the
prison
hospital,
the
hospital
within
the
prison
itself.
i
do
not
think
there
was
really,
although
the
state
contended
that
he
committed
suicide,
he
is
till
to
this
day
contends
that
he
did
not
try
and
commit
suicide
and
i
think
perhaps
that
there
is
a
reasonable
inference
you
can
draw
from
what
happened.
perhaps
he
did
try
and
commit
himself,
but
i
as
an
attorney
i
am
bound
to
still
believe
the
words
of
my
client.
he
tells
me
he
did
not
commit
suicide
and
his
story
on
the
record
why
he
burned
up
the
mattress
stands.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
no,
it
is
not
based
on
that
assumption.
i
think
the
court
below
took
note
of
that.
i
think
the
statue
83-180
states
that
we
really
want
to
transfer
someone
to
lincoln
regional
center
unless
conditioned
upon
a
finding
that
we
cannot
treat
them
here
at
the
penal
complex.
and
one
of
the
big
differences
i
think
between
the
penal
complex
hospital
itself
and
the
lincoln
regional
center,
the
state
mental
hospital
is
that
in
penal
complex
hospitals
itself
a
prisoner
can
walk
down
there
voluntarily
but
he
does
not
have
to
take
medication,
the
doctor
can
prescribe
him,
but
he
can
refuse
to
take
it.
someone
that
have
serious
cases
like
for
example
justice
marshall
mentioned
a
man
that
is
banging
on
everyone,
a
person
like
that
he
would
have
to
be
transferred
to
the
regional
center
because
they
would
not
forcibly
give
him
medication
in
the
penal
complex.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
yes,
your
honor
i
think
the
lower
court
noted
that.
i
think
that
that
is
what
is
included
in
state
law
that
he
is
not
going
to
be
transferred
absent
that
finding
that
he
cannot
be
treated
at
the
penal
complex
adequately.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
there
did
not
seem
to
be
that
i
found
there
was
no
legislative
history
that
i
could
infer
one
way
or
the
other
from
that,
but
i
would
argue
that.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
it
would
depend
upon
what
they
are
doing
to
those
people
on
sixth
floor.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
i
would
argue
that
if
they
forcing
someone
to
take
medication
against
his
will,
placing
him
on
a
behavior
modification
program,
giving
him
a
chemotherapy
in
which
he
has
no
say
on
it
whatsoever
i
think
that
he
ought
to
be
afforded
a
hearing.
it
really
does
not
make
any
difference
whether
you
put
hospital
eight
floors
up
or
you
put
it
two
miles
away
as
it
is
in
the
state
of
nebraska.
it
is
the
nature
of
what
they
do
to
people,
the
prisoner
when
he
is
transferred.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
he
did
not
receive
any
psychiatric
treatment.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
he
received
treatment
just
for
as
burns.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
of
his
burns?
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
no,
sir.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
he
did
not
have
any
hearing.
he
requested
the
medical
treatment.
he
had
no
problem
with
the
medical
treatment.
he
wanted
the
medical
treatment.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
well,
he
did
not
request
one
so
we
might
say
that.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
that
is
not
pause
as
i
understand
and
i
do
not
think
there
is
much
evidence
on
the
record.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
the
statue
provides
that.
they
say
we
send
you
their
evaluation
treatment,
but
in
essence
all
psychiatric
care
is
evaluation
of
treatment.
if
someone
is
sent
to
the
regional
center
and
the
record
is
clear
on
this
point
what
happened
to
larry
jones,
he
was
sent
over
there
and
the
minute
he
was
there
he
was
placed
on
thorazine
and
he
refused
thorazine
so
what
they
did
they
strapped
him
down
and
they
injected
the
thorazine
into
his
body.
he
was
in
a
different
place
at
that
time
for
sure.
he
did
not
really
have
any
choice
what
was
going
to
happen
to
him.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
it
has
everything
to
do
with
why
he
was
transferred
that
is
why
i
think
we
need
a
hearing
when
you
transfer
someone.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
the
issues
at
the
hearing
would
be
whether
or
not
the
patient
or
the
inmate
was
mentally
ill
and
a
danger
to
himself
or
others.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
it
is
contemplated
your
honor
that
there
will
be
other
diagnosis
given
at
the
hearing.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
record
shows
that
the
state
says
we
sent
larry
jones
over
there
for
evaluation,
but
what
happened
the
first
day
he
had
got
there
they
strapped
him
down
and
injected
him
with
thorazine.
now,
that
is
not
--
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
yes
your
honor
just
the
same
if
he
was
to
be
civilly
committed.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
it
certainly
does
not.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
well,
your
honor
if
we
have
a
hearing
i
think
we
have
to
establish
some
type
of
burden
of
proof.
the
lower
court
found
that
the
statute
unconstitutional
and
said
it
mandated
a
hearing
and
it
said
it
would
leave
it
up
to
the
legislature.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
that
is
correct.
i
am
inferring
that
would
the
burden
of
proof
to
civilly
commit
one
in
the
state
of
nebraska
as
established
by
drimus
(ph)
v.
ferrell
and
the
scheme
of
the
mental
health
commitment
statutes.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
i
think
the
lower
court
made
it
clear
though
to
state
in
its
findings
that
this
was
in
essence
a
transfer
from
a
prison
to
a
mental
hospital
and
did
say
that
it
was
therefore
different,
but
it
went
ahead
to
find
exception
noted
to
meachum.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
i
am
not
sure
of
answer
that
question.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
perhaps
i
will
stick
with
that.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
again
your
honor,
it
would
depend
upon
the
difference
in
the
scope
of
the
treatment
that
would
be
given
to
the
individuals.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
i
would
argue
that
we
would
have
to
have
a
hearing
to
send
someone
to
institution
for
the
criminally
insane.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
is
this
a
psychiatric
drug?
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
aspirin,
i
would
say
no
thorazine
i
would
say
yes.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
because
a
man
that
is
on
aspirin
for
two
years
will
not
have
anything
wrong
with
them
after
two
years
and
we
do
not
know
the
state
of
psychiatry
is
in
infant
stage.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
perhaps
shifting
for
aspirin,
but
not
shifting
for
an
operation.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
it
is
not
right
to
have
to
keep
--
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
i
think
we
should
have
a
hearing
first
of
all
for
psychiatric
people,
if
there
is
psychiatric
problem
to
determine
whether
or
not
this
person
is
medically
competent
to
make
that
decision?
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
yes,
i
think
that
is
done.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
and
it
is
not
pursuant
to
80-179.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
he
was
given
a
30
day
initial
examination
in
pursuant
80-179
when
he
initially
went
into
the
nebraska
penal
correctional
complex
and
then
he
was
transferred
with
no
due
process
guarantees
to
the
regional
center
and
then
administered
the
drug.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
well,
the
statute
80-179
--
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
yes,
your
honor.
there
is
a
psychiatrist.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
the
statutes
contend
that
if
they
want
to
do
that
--
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
i
do
not
why
they
send
them
to
an
institution?
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
i
am
objecting
to
the
fact
that
he
was
not
given
a
hearing
before
he
was
sent
over
there.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
i
would
hope
your
honor
he
would
have
a
30
day
and
perhaps
more.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
no,
they
did
not
your
honor.
they
send
him
over
there
and
they
did
not
give
him
any
examination
at
all.
they
strapped
them
down
and
gave
him
medication.
i
think
when
the
lower
court
indicated
that
they
wanted
a
hearing,
i
think
that
the
hearing
they
were
indicating
that
in
that
hearing
there
will
be
separate
testimony
from
different
psychiatrists
and
it
would
be
hope
that
the
patient
involved
would
be
able
to
have
independent
psychiatric
testimony
of
his
own,
that
he
could
offer
at
that
hearing.
i
think
the
important
thing
to
realize
and
why
this
case
is
different
from
meachum
v.
fano
is
the
fact
that
it
is
a
transfer
from
a
prison
to
a
mental
hospital
and
i
think
lower
courts
and
other
courts
have
taken
note
to
the
fact
that
there
is
a
stigma
that
does
attach
to
people
when
they
are
transferred
and
placed
in
psychiatric
care
which
is
not
the
same
type
of
stigma
or
the
one
we
would
receive
if
he
were
to
be
given
just
a
medical
care.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
that
is
a
very
difficult
question
your
honor
because
it
is
kind
of
right
in
between
on
that
line.
i
am
sure
many
psychiatrist
would
feel
that
that
is
a
psychiatric
problem
in
it
of
itself
why
that
person
is
an
alcoholic,
but
on
the
other
hand
because
of
the
dangerous
things
and
the
bad
things
that
it
does
to
your
liver
is
a
physical
problem.
i
would
think
that
alcoholism,
probably
it
would
depend
upon
the
type
of
medication
that
psychiatrist
or
doctor
would
want
to
prescribe
for
the
person
that
is
an
alcoholic.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
i
think
that
sigma
at
the
present
time,
it
probably
is
not
there.
i
think
the
scars
that
he
may
have,
the
physical
scars
are
probably
worse
than
any
stigma
that
he
will
see
later
on
in
his
life.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
i
think
we
are
getting
away,
your
honor?
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
i
believe
so
your
honor
and
one
of
the
first
cases
i
ever
took
as
an
attorney
involved,
it
was
a
question
of
custody
and
a
divorce
as
to
whether
or
not
who
will
have
the
custody
of
the
children.
the
husband
or
the
wife
and
the
husband
was
one
time
an
ex-felon
and
he
had
a
little
girl
and
it
was
brought
up
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
that
the
other
attorney
that
in
effect
this
was
a
very
sick
person
and
that
this
sort
of
thing
might
reoccur
again
because
while
he
was
sick
once
and
that
seemed
to
give
judge
at
the
time
kind
of
any
rebuttable
presumption
that
he
might
be
sick
again.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
it
would
probably
less
though
if
he
went
to
have
that
done
voluntarily.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
i
think
if
one
goes
voluntarily.
i
think
you
waive
any
stigma
that
might
attach
you
so,
but
if
you
are
sent
over
there
and
told
you
will
be
confined
over
there
with
sick
people,
psychiatric
people,
i
think
that
might
stay
with
you
particularly
if
you
did
not
want
to
go.
certainly,
larry
jones
is
going
to
remember
being
strapped
down
and
injected
with
thorazine.
in
re
bailey
case
cited
in
my
brief
detailed
the
number
of
restrictions
or
stigmatizing
things
will
follow.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
that
is
true,
but
your
honor
in
this
case
the
state
of
nebraska
did
not
involuntarily
treat
people
for
psychiatric
problems
in
the
penal
complex
itself.
this
was
something
that
was
to
be
done
at
the
lincoln
regional
center.
in
re
bailey
does
talk
about
a
number
of
state
constitutional
statutory
restrictions
on
boarding
rights,
restrictions
on
ones
right
to
serve
on
a
federal
jury.
some
states
to
get
a
drivers
license.
right
now
if
you
want
to
purchase
a
gun
there
is
a
question
on
the
questionnaire
as
to
whether
or
not
you
have
ever
have
been
incarcerated
in
a
mental
hospital
and
again
i
think
the
mere
fact
that
one
is
in
a
psychiatric
institution
that
sometimes
gives
a
rebuttable
presumption
that
he
may
again
suffer
from
that
occurrence.
it
can
be
used
perhaps
in
some
instances
to
impeach
his
credibility
of
trial
if
his
credibility
trials
ever
put
an
issue
and
again
83-180,
the
third
part
of
the
statute
says
that
at
the
end
of
term
if
the
state
wishes
to
commit
this
person
civilly,
they
can
keep
the
person
their
in
the
hospital
and
then
proceed
with
civil
commitment
procedures
very
hastily.
i
think
if
i
was
sitting
in
a
mental
health
board
and
i
saw
the
state
come
forward
with
an
inmate
who
had
actually
been
there
in
a
mental
hospital
for
two
years
i
think
there
would
be
a
rebuttable
presumption.
i
think
it
is
in
my
mind
if
as
i
see
someone
walking
in
i
do
not
know
if
he
maybe
over
medicated,
i
do
not
know
what
his
condition
is
i
think
i
might
want
to
put
a
lot
of
weight
into
the
credibility
of
the
state
at
that
time.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
he
is
in
a
psychiatric
wing
at
the
veterans
hospital?
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
i
believe
your
honor
and
it
just
gets
into
the
mootness
in
this
issue.
it
is
not
on
the
record,
larry
jones
took
the
parole
voluntarily
because
it
was
the
only
parole
they
offered
him.
he
was
so
afraid
of
what
they
were
going
to
do
to
him
in
nebraska
and
he
said
i
am
going
and
i
do
not
want
to
come
back.
that
is
why,
he
is
taking
his
medication
voluntarily
in
illinois
because
he
is
afraid
that
he
is
going
to
be
sent
back
to
the
state
of
nebraska
and
that
is
what
he
tells
me.
i
think
the
case
is
not
moot
though
because
there
are
a
number
of
cases
the
court
has
looked
at
and
found
that
there
are
collateral
consequences
to
criminal
convictions
and
i
think
we
can
analogize
here
on
the
case
also
because
of
the
stigmatizing
consequences
that
happen
to
someone
when
he
sent
to
a
psychiatric
hospital
are
very
similar
to
the
what
they
call
farther
than
the
stigma
which
follows
one
who
is
put
in
prison.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
i
do
not
think
this
is
bad.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
the
record
also
does
indicate
although
i
do
forget
the
page,
it
was
in
the
testimony
of
dr.
coats
that
i
said
what
is
the
lincoln
regional
center?
he
says
it
is
a
state
mental
hospital.
at
one
time
it
was
called
the
state
hospital
for
the
insane,
but
i
think
what
they
did
was
just
change
name
keeping
with
current
psychiatric
thought
so
it
would
not
sound
as
bad.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
no
your
honor,
it
does
not.
the
transfer
was
effectuated
after
the
hearing
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
that
is
correct
your
honor
because
he
is
taking
it
voluntarily.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
i
do
not
think
the
case
is
moot.
i
think
maybe
if
the
court
--
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
i
think
that
the
court
would
find
that
there
is
no
continuing
injury.
i
think
that
you
could
find
that
there
are
a
collateral
consequences
to
this
conviction,
not
a
conviction,
but
to
this
transfer
that
the
state
effectuated
upon
him
by
sending
him
to
the
lincoln
regional
center.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
he
in
some
sense
is
responsible
because
he
went
their
voluntarily
himself
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
i
understand
there
is
some
proceeding
to
while
he
is
paroled.
they
are
doing
an
investigation
right
now,
but
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
he
will
stay
in
the
danville
psychiatric
way
in
the
hospital.
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
i
think
there
is
still
a
spirit
of
controversy
here
because
i
think
--
mr.
thomas
a.
wurtz
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
the
case
is
moot.
