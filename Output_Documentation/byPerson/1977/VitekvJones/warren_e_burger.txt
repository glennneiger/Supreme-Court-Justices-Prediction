chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
vitek
v.
jones.
mr.
kammerlohr
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
a
civil
commitment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
he
develops
symptoms
of
acute
appendicitis,
what
will
they
do
with
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
any
illness,
they
transfer
him
to
a
hospital?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
take
the
specific
example.
what
mr.
justice
white
suggested
to
you,
he
does
not
want
an
insulin
shock
treatment
which
is
prescribe
by
the
psychiatrist.
what
relief
do
you
think
you
could
have,
habeas
corpus?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
he
filed
habeas
and
the
court
said,
“well,
i
am
not
going
to
release
you,
but
on
this
showing
i
will
restrain
the
particular
condition
of
your
treatment,
namely
the
administration
of
insulin
shock
treatment
until
there
is
more
evidence
presented.”
could
you
do
that
under
your
state
procedure?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
about
federal
habeas?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
a
patient
gets
violent
as
some
of
the
incorrigible
ones
do,
they
administer
tranquilizer
sometimes,
if
you
know?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
does
not
apply
if
you
are
taking
him
downtown
to
have
his
appendicitis
removed
either
you
said?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
a
state
institution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
wurtz?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
suggest
that
the
state
of
nebraska
has
any
responsibility
for
either
his
custody
or
his
treatment
at
the
present
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
was
a
condition
of
his
parole.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
he
escaped
from
the
veterans
hospital
in
illinois
he
would
be
in
violation
of
the
conditions
of
parole
and
would
be
a
fugitive,
would
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
reason
to
believe
that
the
veterans
administration
has
some
bias
against
him
or
is
treating
him
improperly
in
any
way?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
going
to
have
a
hearing
to
see
whether
he
should
have
his
appendix
removed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
he
says
he
is
a
christian
scientist
and
will
not
submit
to
any
surgery?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
us
back
up
on
what
brought
that
on.
here
is
a
man
who
in
fact
set
fire
to
himself
with
burns
so
severe
that
he
was
five
months
in
the
hospital
being
treated
for
burns.
is
it
unreasonable
to
draw
an
inference
that
there
is
possibly
some
mental
and
emotional
instability
in
that
man
that
needs
treatment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
not
a
prima
facie
case
that
he
needs
mental
treatment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
how
about
the
fire?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
they
had
a
wing
at
the
hospital
or
let
us
say
the
top
three
floors
of
the
hospital
of
the
penal
institution
was
a
hospital
for
a
emotionally
and
mentally
disturbed
prisoners,
now
they
move
in
from
the
second
floor
to
the
top
floor,
you
say
they
are
going
to
have
a
hearing
to
that.
on
the
top
floor
i
assuming
the
psychiatrists
are
in
charge
and
the
function
and
activity
there
is
the
same
as
in
the
state
mental
institution,
you
have
to
have
a
hearing
to
move
him
from
the
second
floor
to
the
sixth
floor?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
are
doing
the
same
thing
they
are
doing
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
can
hold
that
hearing
before
you
have
had
a
diagnosis?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
what
he
is
being
sent
for
to
the
hospital
and
they
cannot
give
a
diagnosis
in
one
day
or
two
days?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
are
they
going
to
hear
at
this
hearing,
if
no
psychiatrist
has
been
able
to
give
him
a
30
or
60
day
examination?
do
you
think
any
psychiatrist
is
going
to
make
an
evaluation
on
just
walking
him
into
a
hearing
room
and
giving
a
judgment
or
is
he
going
to
say
he
wants
at
least
a
30
day
or
perhaps
more?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
was
not
that
what
the
state
of
nebraska
did
to
him
here,
send
him
to
a
place
where
he
could
get
an
adequate
examination?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that
is
worst
stigma
than
being
in
prison
than
having
gone
through
the
process
of
setting
himself
on
fire?
do
you
think
there
is
some
stigma
that
is
gong
to
be
worse
than
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
want
to
hold
nebraska
responsible
for
the
collateral
consequences
of
his
being
in
illinois
in
a
mental
institution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
is
expired
mr.
wurtz.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes
you
have
said
that
before
and
your
time
is
expired.
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
kammerlohr?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
might
want
more
than
a
law
clerk’s
opinion
however,
might
they
not
mr.
kammerlohr?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
