suppose
a
prisoner
says
i
know
this
mental
facility
and
you
propose
to
give
me
shock
treatments
or
something
like
that,
well,
i
do
not
want
those
treatments
and
i
do
want
to
go
back,
i
know
you
got
to
keep
me
somewhere,
but
i
do
not
want
to
be
over
here
and
submit
to
the
treatments.
i
take
it
you
say
that
although
if
you
were
not
in
prison,
the
state
could
not
keep
them.
do
you
think
you
are
entitled
to
keep
him
because
he
has
been
sentenced
to
a
prison
term?
