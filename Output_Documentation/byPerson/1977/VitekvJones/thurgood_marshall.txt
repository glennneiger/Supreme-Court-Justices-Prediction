justice
thurgood

mr.
kammerlohr
the
difference
is
that
he
is
very
glad
to
go
to
get
the
treatment
and
that
is
why
they
do
not
come
up.
when
a
man
got
appendicitis,
i
cannot
conceive
of
him
complaining
about
being
cured
of
appendicitis?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
say
some
people
are
crazy
and
then
they
get,
what
is
it,
they
do
not
agree
with
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
that
is
the
difference.
i
do
not
think
the
other
one
for
just
ordinary
medical
treatment,
i
do
not
think
the
problem
comes
up?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
the
one.
he
is
going
cooperative
with
that,
but
what
would
have
happened
if
he
did
not?
suppose
he
says
i
am
probably
lay
in
doubt
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
attorney
general,
the
prison
has
no
jurisdiction
over
the
hospital,
but
once
he
goes
there,
the
prison
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
prisoner,
yes
or
no?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
they
are
entitled
to
come
back,
i
mean
the
prison
does
not
describe
what
treatment
he
gets?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
how
why
do
they
do
it
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
mental
institution
did
turn
him
lose
on
the
pubic,
is
it
not
that
true?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
they
do
not
turn
him
lose,
they
turned
him
back
to
the
prison?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
got
appendicitis
and
they
take
you
to
a
city
hospital
you
could
object
to
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
said
you
usually
have
the
right
to
commit
suicide.
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
he
becomes
violent,
suppose
he
starts
beating
up
everyone,
are
you
going
to
have
a
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
inside
the
of
the
prison,
the
man
is
just
raving
insane
and
he
says
all
of
you
blank,
the
blank,
need
to
die
and
then
he
starts
to
banging
on
them,
does
he
have
to
have
a
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
who
is
going
to
come
in
at
a
hearing,
if
he
is
banging
on
everybody,
who
is
going
to
volunteer
to
the
hearing,
would
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
you
volunteer
a
hearing?
he
had
beaten
up
everybody
he
laid
eyes
on,
would
you
give
him
a
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
he
went
to
that
burn
hospital
did
he
not
get
some
treatment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
did
not
receive
the
treatment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
sort
of
enjoyed
it
did
he
not?
he
did
not
complain,
did
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
about
the
treatment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
did
not
have
any
hearing
either,
did
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
it
is
up
to
him
as
whether
he
wants
a
hearing
for
a
medical
treatment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
this
is
where
we
end
up.
i
understand
with
attorney
general
that
they
just
wanted
him
to
go
to
the
hospital
to
be
examined
and
if
he
was
found
not
in
need
of
treatment
he
would
be
returned
to
where
he
wanted
to
be,
is
that
correct?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
would
you
do
with
the
institution
in
the
state
not
too
far
from
here
in
new
york
that
has
one
prison
that
is
in
two
parts.
one
part
is
criminally
insane
and
the
other
part
is
criminal
and
they
move
across
the
same
building,
you
are
supposed
to
have
a
hearing
for
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
would
be
different
treatment,
one
is
medical
and
one
is
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
supposedly,
criminal
hospital
and
there
are
many
institutions
that
very
good
hospitals,
many
criminal
institutions
and
the
man
goes
there
and
he
said
with
this
type
of
disease
you
have
i
might
give
you
this
drug
and
you
say
i
will
not
take
it
then
you
have
a
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no
sir
it
is
a
drug
and
i
do
not
need
anything
to
be
added
to
it.
it
is
a
drug
that
i
do
not
want.
the
prisoner
does
not
want,
aspirin,
anything,
does
he
have
to
have
a
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why?
what
is
the
difference
between
the
two,
it
is
the
mans
individual
right
your
talking
about?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
then
the
man
does
not
have
an
absolute
right
to
decide
whether
he
will
take
a
certain
treatment
or
not,
you
shift
him
again?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
you
said
certain
kind
of
drug.
i
just
want
to
know
what
does
right
that
this
man
has
that
he
has
to
have
a
hearing
for?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
do
not
know,
i
am
not
a
physician,
but
i
would
take
any
drug
in
the
world
if
you
can
find
two
doctors
one
will
say
is
right
and
the
other
one
says
wrong.
who
decides
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
do
you
not
agree
that
before
the
hearing
he
should
be
examined?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
what
we
have
done
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
he
not
to
go
for
examination
and
he
said
that
they
gave
him
a
drug?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
could
he
be
examined
except
to
be
transferred?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
there
any
facilities
in
the
prison
involved
for
getting
the
psychiatric
examination?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
question
was
to
make
a
thorough
psychiatric
examination?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
find
a
prison
with
one
of
those
you
will
let
me
know
will
you,
none
of
them
have
that.
that
is
why
they
are
sent
to
these
institutions,
is
it
not
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
are
you
objecting
if
you
do
not
know
what
you
are
objecting
to?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
all.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
are
going
to
way
pass
this
case
because
this
man
is
going
to
examine
or
not,
is
he
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
this
you
argue
is
way
over
this
case
is
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
there
is
a
lot
of
difference
between
being
in
aa
hospital
that
is
run
by
the
government
and
an
average
insane
asylum
run
by
the
state.
people
do
not
have
the
same
feeling
about
them,
do
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
is
a
veterans
administration
hospital,
where
is
my
father,
he
is
in
the
state
insane
asylum
for
felony
insane
people,
there
is
a
difference?
