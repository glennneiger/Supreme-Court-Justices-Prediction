justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
do
with
the
last
sentence
of
the
statute
in
appendix,
page
five
of
your
jurisdictional
statement.
it
says
a
person
who
is
so
transferred
shall
remain
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
and
custody
of
the
department
of
correctional
services
and
shall
be
returned
to
the
department
when
prior
to
the
to
expiration
of
his
sentence,
treatment,
such
facility
is
no
longer
necessary.
do
you
say
that
the
treatment
is
no
longer
necessary,
decision
is
one
that
is
made
by
the
people
in
the
transferee
facility
and
the
warden
in
the
transferring
facility
must
respect
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
suggested
a
moment
ago
that
if
he
did
not
take
his
medication,
he
would
soon
be
back
in
nebraska?
is
that
on
the
thought
the
veterans
hospitals
would
refuse
to
have
any
more
to
do
with
him?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
true
with
lots
of
other
complaints
besides
psychiatric
ones
as
i
understand.
if
you
have
a
back
problem
or
liver
problem
and
any
number
of
things
that
happen
to
people
twice
your
age,
you
can
find
out
that
the
doctors
says
either
do
this,
follow
my
advice
have
an
operation
or
do
not
have
an
operation
or
i
just
cannot
go
on
treating.
it
is
not
limited
to
psychiatric
care?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
it
was
lsd
in
the
experimental
phases
that
one
reads
about
in
the
newspapers
experimental
drugs,
are
you
suggesting
that
that
is
permissible,
but
something
other
than
medication
is
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
doctors?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
your
case
really
depends
on
our
assumption
that
exactly
the
same
treatment
could
have
been
given
to
him
in
the
facility
where
he
was
as
would
be
given
to
him
in
the
facility
to
which
he
was
transferred,
does
he
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
statue
was
intended
to
confer
a
right
on
the
prisoner
that
certain
findings
be
made
or
that
certain
fact
situations
exist
before
he
was
transferred?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
think
that
was
intended
to
confer
a
right
on
him?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
his
having
been
transferred,
it
looks,
does
it
not,
as
you
have
said
they
could
have
done
it
eight
floors
up
in
the
same
building?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
district
court
went
i
thought
on
quite
a
different
theory
than
you
answer
to
the
question
of
my
brother
stewart.
it
did
not
talk
about
the
right
to
refuse
involuntary
treatment.
it
went
on
meachum
v.
fano,
montanye
analysis
of
a
right
of
someone
who
already
committed
to
have
some
sort
of
hearing
before
he
was
transferred
to
another
kind
of
institution.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
rested
its
judgment
i
thought
on
the
fact
that
state
law
conferred
this
right
on
it
and
my
brother
stewartâ€™s
question
was
surely
even
though
a
state
law
did
not
confer
right
upon
you
to
be
free
from
involuntary
brain
surgery,
you
might
well
have
a
due
process
right,
but
it
would
not
be
a
meachum
v.
fano
type
analysis.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
you
are
transferred
for
treatment
for
alcoholism?
