mr.
mcclain,
would
the
theory
of
your
case
be
different
if
your
client
had
been
an
aclu
lawyer
who
would
have
tried
the
case
had
the
solicitation
been
successful?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
you
stand
on
button
on
that
particular
point?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
can
i
have
one
step
further?
assume
further
that
the
aclu
lawyer,
contrary
to
its
practice,
allowed
counsel
who
handled
damage
suits,
which
would
have
been
this
suit,
a
percentage
of
the
recovery
of
the
fee.
would
that
make
this
commercial
speech
rather
than
non-commercial
speech?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
even
if
there
were
a
fee
interest
in
the
damage
recovery,
you
would
not
regard
that
as
commercial
speech?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
is
the
difference
between
that
and
the
sterilization,
which
is
a
bad
form
of
battery,
i
guess?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
was
under
the
impression,
maybe
i
have
a
wrong
view
of
the
record,
that
this
doctor
did
these
services
free
at
this,
that
is
not
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
is
not,
i
see.
he
would
do
it
if
the
patient
would
agree
to
this
condition.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
first
case
which
is
77-56,
in
re
edna
smith
primus,
two
of
the
decisions
that
i
am
authorized
to
announce
today,
involve
disciplinary
action
by
state
bars
against
lawyers
charged
with
solicitation.
the
cases
present
contrasting
examples
of
solicitation.
one
type
that
we
hold
protected
by
the
first
amendment
and
the
other
a
type
we
think
the
state
may
forbid.
the
first
case,
the
name
of
which
i
had
mentioned,
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
south
california.
appellant,
a
member
of
the
bar
of
that
state
also
is
a
cooperating
lawyer
with
the
columbia,
south
carolina
branch
of
the
american
civil
liberties
union.
after
advising
a
group
of
lay
persons
as
to
civil
rights'
claims,
appellant
wrote,
one
of
them,
a
letter
advising
that
free
legal
assistance
would
be
available
from
the
aclu,
if
it
were
desired.
the
south
carolina
bar,
acting
pursuant
to
state
authority,
initiated
a
disciplinary
proceedings
against
appellate.
she
was
charged
with
violating
the
standard
of
professional
conduct
that
proscribes
the
solicitation
of
clients.
she
was
found
guilty
of
violating
the
standard,
and
received
a
public
reprimand.
in
a
case
here
in
1963,
naacp
versus
button,
the
court
held
that
members
of
that
association,
including
lawyers
as
well
as
lay
persons
engage
in
litigation
as
a
form
of
political
expression.
as
these
activities
are
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
the
court
held
that
naacp
members
lawfully
could
advise
prospective
litigants
of
their
constitutional
rights,
and
recommend
naacp
compensated
lawyers
to
represent
them.
we
think
that
the
court's
decision
in
button
controls
this
case.
the
appellant
here
sought
no
client
or
professional
employment
for
herself.
as
a
member
the
aclu,
she
gave
legal
advice
as
to
civil
rights
and
followed
them
up
with
an
offer
of
professional
services
not
her
own
but
an
aclu
lawyer.
that
organization
engages
a
litigation
not
for
profit,
but
as
an
effective
form
of
political
expression
in
furtherance
of
rights
though
to
be
protected
by
the
constitution.
as
we
may
clear
in
the
next
case,
the
state
interest
in
regulating
licensed
members
of
the
legal
profession
is
substantial,
but
where
political
and
associational
rights
are
being
exercised,
the
regulation
must
be
narrowly
drawn
and
focused
on
protecting
the
public
for
overreaching
undue
influence
conflict
of
interest
and
other
substantive
evils.
we
hold
that
south
carolina's
application
of
its
rules
to
appellants'
solicitation
on
the
behalf
of
aclu,
violates
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
we,
therefore,
reverse
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
that
state.
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
mr.
justice
marshall
has
filed
an
opinion
in
number
76-60
and
50
which
is
the
next
case
i
shall
announce,
in
which
he
concurs
in
part,
and
concurs
in
the
judgment
of
this
case.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
mr.
justice
brennan
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
