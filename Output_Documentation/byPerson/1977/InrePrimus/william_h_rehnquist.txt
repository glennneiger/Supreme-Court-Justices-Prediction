justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
this
case
mr.
mcclain,
your
client
pursued
a
little
more
aggressively
than
in
button,
did
she
not?
why
was
she
not
present
at
the
initial
meeting
and
then
was
told
that
if
the
client
wished
to
employ
her
services,
the
client
would
let
her
know
and
then,
nonetheless,
your
client
followed
up
with
a
second
solicitation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
clear
though
that
your
client
did
make
a
second
attempt
to
persuade
the
litigant
to
file
a
suit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
putting
to
one
side
the
characterization
of
the
letter
which
maybe
subject
to
reasonable
interpretations
on
both
sides,
that
follow-up
letter
is
a
fact
that
was
not
present
in
button,
is
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
was
there
or
were
there
not
evidence
of
follow-up
letters
in
button?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
substantial
civil
liberties
litigation,
what
do
you
mean?
do
you
mean
a
constitutional
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
does
one
know
the
contours
of
that
if
you
include
within
it
statutory
rights?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
a
state
statute
that
gives
you
a
right
of
action
against
someone
who
deliberately
runs
you
down
in
a
car
for
personal
damages?
that
is
not
a
civil
liberty
statute.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
were
these
raw
maternity
cases?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
were
medicaid
cases
of
pregnant
women
and
the
expenses
were
in
connection
with
the
birth
of
their
children,
is
that
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
after
the
second
or
third,
i
guess
it
was
the
third
child,
he
said
“no,
i
will
not
be
your
physician
anymore
unless
you
agree
to
be
sterilized.”
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
you
decide
this
case
on
the
basis
of
how
you
feel
about
particular
kinds
of
lawsuits?
does
there
not
have
to
be
some
general
rule
one
way
or
the
other?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
rule
10-b5,
for
example
that
certainly
encourages
litigation
between
an
established
relationship
of
a
client
and
a
stockbroker?
can
you
make
that
generalization
against
the
constitutional
challenge
that
the
state
has
the
right
to
discourage
steering
up
litigation
that
questions
or
challenges
an
established
relationship?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
kale,
with
all
respect
to
my
colleagues
and
many
here
in
the
room,
what
is
the
difference
for
constitutional
purposes
between
the
relationship
between
a
doctor
and
his
patient
or
a
lawyer
and
his
client
and
the
relationship
between
the
avon
lady
and
the
person
she
calls
on
to
sell
cosmetics
to?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah,
ordinarily,
i
would
think
of
her
as
a
customer
rather
than
a
client.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
it
heightens
the
state’s
interest
when
you
have
this
kind
of
professional
relationship?
