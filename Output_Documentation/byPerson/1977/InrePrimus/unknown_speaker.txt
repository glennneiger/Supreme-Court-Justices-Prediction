unknown
speaker
certainly,
you
do
not
claim
that
just
because
something
is
a
letter,
the
writer
of
it
cannot
be
punished
in
all
sorts
of
context.
a
blackmailing
letter
can
be
punishable
under
the
criminal
law
of
any
state
constitution,
can
it
not
be?
unknown
speaker
by
demanding
ransom?
unknown
speaker
just
the
fact
it
is
a
letter
does
not
give
it
a
free
ticket
constitutionally
to
go
unscathed
through
all
the
criminal
statutes
state
and
federally
in
the
united
states,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
and
all
sorts
of
speech
like
deceptive
speech,
fraudulent
speech,
blackmailing
speech.
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
true
also
if
a
coded
classified
ad
were
put
in
a
legitimate
in
the
newspaper,
a
legitimate
newspaper,
taking
an
ad
which
purported
to
be
an
ad
for
the
sale
of
house,
but
in
fact
was,
by
a
prearranged
code,
a
direction
for
how
to
pay
a
ransom
in
a
kidnapping.
that
would
not
be
protected,
would
it,
just
because
it
was
in
a
newspaper?
unknown
speaker
mr.
mcclain,
you
said
you
did
not
see
a
difference
between
the
oral
reading
in
july
and
the
letter
in
august,
but
the
oral
meeting
was
advice
on
the
merits,
as
i
understand
it
and
the
august
letter
was
a
solicitation
after
giving
advice
on
the
merits.
there
is
at
least
a
difference,
is
there
not?
unknown
speaker
“would
you
like
to
bring
an
action
on
your
behalf,
then
this
practice
must
stop.”
it
was
within
the
power
of
the
court
to
treat
that
as
a
solicitation,
i
believe,
would
you
not
agree
to
that?
you
could
not
say
such
a
finding
is
clearly
erroneous.
unknown
speaker
but
do
you
not
think
it
is
fair
to
read
that
letter
as
recommending
that
she
file
a
lawsuit?
unknown
speaker
i
would
think
so,
“this
practice
must
stop”,
that
is
what
the
letter
says.
unknown
speaker
by
the
author
of
the
letter
to
the
person
who
was
reading
it,
yes.
unknown
speaker
then,
towards
the
end
of
the
letter,
she
said
“after
labor
day,
call
me
collect”
and
gave
her
telephone
number.
unknown
speaker
does
that
not
support
the
concept
of
solicitation
with
the
finding?
unknown
speaker
by
hypothesis,
you
would
not
say
in
the
letter
“if
you
are
not
interested,
let
me
know.”
unknown
speaker
could
i
ask
you,
what
rule
was
she
found
to
have
violated?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
is
an
independent
rule?
is
that
a
prohibition,
i
thought
it
was
just
an
exception.
unknown
speaker
where
did
the
court
not
accept
that?
unknown
speaker
what
is
that?
unknown
speaker
that
goes
on
and
says
that
the
court
adapts
the
panel
report
is
inaccurate.
unknown
speaker
is
that
not
right?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
final?
unknown
speaker
because
d-5
does
not
independently
proscribe
any
conduct,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
what
conduct
do
you
think
it
prescribes?
that
you
may
not
solicit
business
for
an
organization
if
its
primary
purpose
is
to
litigate,
is
that
way
it
has
been
interpreted,
you
say,
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
it
could
only
be
read
as
saying
that
her
conduct,
in
the
view
of
the
court,
did
not
come
within
the
exception
of
d5.
unknown
speaker
if
it
does
not
come
within
the
exception,
then
what
she
violates
is
d
and
that
requires
for
solicitation
for
her
own
benefit.
unknown
speaker
to
promote
her
services.
unknown
speaker
do
you
still
argue,
let
me
have
this
clear,
that
this
letter
does
not
constitute
a
solicitation?
unknown
speaker
may
i
draw
your
attention
to
the
last
five
lines.
“about
the
lawsuit,
if
you
are
interested,
let
me
know
and
i
will
let
you
know
when
we
will
come
down
to
talk
to
you
about
it,
we
will
be
coming
down
to
talk
to
mrs.
waters
and
so
forth.”
unknown
speaker
mr.
mcclain,
i
take
it
you
feel
this
case
is
very
different
from
the
ohralik
case?
