we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
the
matter
of
edna
smith,
the
appellant,
77-56.
mr.
mcclain,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
suggest
that
the
right
to
face-to-face
solicitation
is
co-extensive
with
the
right
to
advertise
and
announce
the
fees
which
will
be
charged
for
a
particular
service?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
suggest
that
a
face-to-face
solicitation
by
an
trained
lawyer
on
the
one
hand
and
the
untrained
layman,
untrained
at
least
in
the
law,
presents
the
same
arm’s
length
factors
as
an
announcement
in
the
paper
of
a
schedule
of
fees?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
was
beginning
by
relating
it
to
the
case
which
we
just
heard
argued.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
the
written
letter
is
equated
roughly
to
the
announcement
in
the
newspaper?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
not
sure
whether
your
colloquy
with
mr.
justice
rehnquist
refers
to
the
letter
which
i
thought
was
the
only
letter.
let
me
read
a
part
of
it
and
see,
she
wrote
and
said
“you
will
probably
remember
me
from
talking
with
you
at
mr.
allen’s
office
in
july
about
the
sterilization
performed
on
you.
the
american
civil
liberties
union
would
like
to
file
a
lawsuit
on
your
behalf
for
money
against
the
doctor.
is
that
the
letter
we
are
talking
about?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
i
have
understood
that
all
of
this
colloquy
was
directed
at
whether
this
was
commercial
or
non-commercial
speech.
at
least
i
understood
mr.
justice
stevens’
question
to
you
was
directed
at
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
having
said
“call
me
collect”
and
all
these
other
preliminaries.
do
you
still
maintain
that
it
is
not
a
soliciting
letter?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
put
it
in
another
way.
you
say
that
that
letter
is
not
an
adequate
basis
for
a
finding
by
the
fact
finder
that
solicitation
took
place.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
kale.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
say
that
brings
them
within
the
definition
of
associates?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
they
have
to
be
partners
to
get
within
103d
or
is
also
their
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
do
we
find
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
there
not
something
in
justice
black’s
opinion
to
the
effect
that
this
was
embraced
within
the
services
that
the
union
members
were
receiving
in
exchange
for
their
dues
to
have
a
lawyer
experienced
in
these
kinds
of
cases?
isn't
there
some
intervention
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
you
indicate
there
are
other
prohibitions
about
a
non-lawyer
soliciting
business
for
lawyers.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
at
1
o'clock
counsel.
you
may
resume
mr.
kale.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
