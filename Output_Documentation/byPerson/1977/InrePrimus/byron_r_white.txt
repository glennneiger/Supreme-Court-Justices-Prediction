justice
byron

white
what
if
it
did
then
what
would
that
violate?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
she
were?
justice
byron
r.
white
she
was
charged
with
aiding
an
organization
to
promote
her
legal
services
with
that
of
her
associate.
she
was
not
charged
with
helping
some
organization
raise
some
money.
justice
byron

white
whether
or
not
it
is
within
or
without
the
language,
it
is
a
matter
of
state
law,
is
it
not?
and
none
of
our
concern,
except
in
so
far
as
it
may
go
to
show
how
vague
and
unconstitutionally
broad,
perhaps
in
your
submission,
the
language
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
or
not
it
is
inside
or
outside
it
is
a
matter
for
the
state
court
to
decide
and
it
has
decided
it.
is
that
not
correct?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
am
interested
in
finding
out
what
your
understanding
is
as
to
what
the
conduct
was
that
violated
103d,
that
first
sentence
that
brother
stevens
talked
about.
is
it
recommending
the
services
of
the
aclu
which
was
using
an
associate
of
hers
as
a
lawyer?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mind
telling
me
early
in
the
game
how
you
think
the
conduct
involved
here
violated
103d,
that
first
sentence,
if
that
is
your
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
can
just
tell
me,
how
did
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
that
she
was
aiding
an
organization
to
promote
her
services
or
an
associate’s
service.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
associate
was
not
a
law
partner,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
were
sharing
expenses
and
keeping
their
own
fees,
that
is
what
the
finding
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
the
same
if
the
writer
of
the
letter
is
an
employee
of
the
american
civil
liberties
union,
a
hired
lawyer
or
a
paid
staff
member?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
do
not
think
that
is
covered
by
button?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
legal
department
of
a
union
writes
to
one
of
its
members
recommending
that
the
members
start
litigation
with
respect
to
something
that
has
happened
to
them,
would
that
be
proscribed
by
these
rules
or
the
union
is
not
the
kind
of
an
organization
that
is
covered
by
the
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
union
were
involved,
i
suppose
its
lawyers
could
make
recommendations
to
its
members.
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
not
to
outsiders?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
rule
would
cover,
if
there
is
one,
a
direct
solicitation
by
the
aclu,
say
that
precedent
of
the
aclu,
a
non-lawyer
wrote
the
same
letter
to
this
lady,
would
there
be
similarities?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
is
there
a
statute
that
prohibits
that
kind
of
solicitation?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
it
cover
my
example?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
organization
uses
a
lawyer
to
solicit,
it
is
covered
under
this
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
the
naacp
today
violate
this
rule
or
the
paid
staff
lawyers
for
the
naacp,
if
they
wrote
non-members
of
the
naacp
suggesting
litigation
to
cure
some
situation
that
the
naacp
thinks
should
be
cured?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
your
answer?
is
it
yes?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
it
would
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
a
school
suit.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
mean
no
school
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
the
it
wants
to
get
specific
individuals
to
bring
the
suit
and
they
will
represent
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
the
paid
lawyer
for
the
naacp
is
writing
a
letter
soliciting
business
or
soliciting
a
lawsuit
and
the
naacp
will
profit
from
an
attorney’s
fee?
