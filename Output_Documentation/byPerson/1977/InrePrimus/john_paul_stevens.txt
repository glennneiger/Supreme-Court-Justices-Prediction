justice
john
paul
stevens
then
what
does
make
it
commercial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
if
a
drug
store
had
a
sale,
“if
you
bought
one
cake
of
soap,
you
get
a
second
cake
free,”
that
would
not
be
commercial
for
the
second
cake
of
soap?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
not
any
offering
of
goods
or
services
at
any
price
commercial
in
the
general
sense
of
the
word
as
contrasted
to
the
other
kinds
of
speech,
social,
economic,
political,
or
religious?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
mcclain,
i
do
not
think
that
distinction
could
holdup.
supposing
the
letter
was
written
to
a
stockholder
and
there
was
an
offer
to
represent
a
class
of
stockholders
to
get
a
big
recovery
in
a
statement
in
the
letter
that
we
will
not
charge
you
a
dime,
it
would
be
free
to
you.
would
that
be
non-commercial
solicitation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
from
the
corporation,
--
it
is
just
like
they
were
here,
as
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
us
say
it
is
a
class
action
instead
of
a
derivative
suit
then,
but
they
just
want
to
get
money,
and
would
the
mere
fact
that
there
would
be
no
charge
unless
the
litigation
was
successful
make
it
not
commercial
speech,
is
that
your
position?
that
is
what
i
understood
you
to
say.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no
charge
to
the
person
being
solicited
for
the
litigation.
what
about
this
case?
it
was
contemplated
that
they
would
recover
dollars
and
that
those
dollars
would,
in
part,
go
into
the
coffers
of
the
aclu,
that
is
what
the
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
a
suit
for
damages,
it
was
described
as
a
suit
for
damages.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
we
not
have
to
accept
that
the
state
court’s
view
of
the
matter
that
it
was
contemplated
that
the
fee
would
be
paid
to
the
aclu
and
that
would
be
dollars?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
just
like
the
damages
would
be
ordered
by
the
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
not
think
that
is
a
reasonable
inference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
mcclain,
before
you
sit
down,
i
understand
your
argument
in
104a,
there
was
no
acceptance
of
employment
so
the
language
just
does
not
seem
to
apply.
i
do
not
thoroughly
understand
your
position
on
103d5.
i
understand
the
exception
part
does
not
apply,
but
why
does
not
the
first
sentence
cover
this,
“a
lawyer
shall
not
knowingly
assist
a
person
or
organization,
your
client
shall
not
assist
the
aclu
that
recommends,
furnishes
or
pays
for
legal
services
to
promote
his
services
or
those
of
his
partners
or
associates.”
now,
was
it
not
clear
that
the
associates
of
your
client
were
involved
in
the
litigation
and
one
of
them
was
paid
by
the
aclu?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
she
assisted
an
organization
that
was
using
the
services
of
those
partners.
it
would
not
have
really
mattered.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
it
is
covered
by
this,
it
is
constitutionally
protected.
that
is
your
main
argument,
not
that
it
is
not
within
the
language.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kale,
may
i
just
ask
one
question
here.
supposing
the
letter
had
not
been
written
by
ms.
smith,
but
rather
had
been
written
by
the
aclu,
would
such
a
letter
have
been
constitutionally
protected?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
honor,
we
do
not
believe
it
would
be.
i
am
just
wondering
that
is
not
a
distinction
that
you
rely
on
with
respect
to
the
button
case
and
the
fact,
the
letter
was
written
by
the
lawyer
rather
than
by
the
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
sir.
of
course,
the
distinction
here
is
that
as
a
disciplinary
action,
we
have
ability
to
discipline
attorneys.
we
do
not
have
the
ability
to
confront
the
organization.
i
will
presume
that
you
get
an
injunction
against
the
layperson
or
something
like
that.
what
if
she
had
just
given
advice
at
the
first
meeting
and
had
not
said
“we
will
represent
you
or
the
aclu
will
represent
you,”
and
then
she
went
home
and
a
month
later
the
aclu
decided
“yes,
it
would
finance
a
lawsuit”,
and
then
they
had
written
this
letter,
would
it
have
been
protected
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
that
is
so
and
if
the
aclu
did
not
decide
to
provide
free
legal
services
for
this
person
until
after
the
first
meeting,
how
could
the
aclu
communicate
that
information
to
that
person?
is
there
anyway
in
the
world
they
could
do
it
without
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
i
am
saying
--
supposing
the
first
meeting
was
a
little
more
inconclusive
--
assume
the
first
meeting
is
legal
advice
about
a
potential
lawsuit
and
nothing
about
financing
or
willingness
to
participate
and
then
the
lawyer
goes
home.
after
that,
the
aclu
decides
“yes,
we
would
like
to
sponsor
this
litigation.”
can
they
constitutionally
tell
the
potential
client
that
fact?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then,
there
is
just
no
way
that
that
information
could
be
communicated
to
the
potential
client.
that
is
what
you
are
saying.
the
constitution
does
not
afford
any
protection
to
that
particular
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kale,
the
distinction
between
members
and
non-members,
the
button
case
if
i
remember
involves
solicitation
of
litigation
of
non-members
of
the
naacp,
did
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
is
that
different
from
an
aclu
program
to
put
an
end
to
sterilization?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
they
probably
found
no
state
action,
but
at
the
time
of
what
we
are
describing
as
a
solicitation,
it
was
the
view
of
the
aclu
and
its
attorneys
that
there
was
a
valid
state
action
theory
that
they
could
proceed
on,
was
it
not?
they
did
file
a
1983-case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
...against
the
doctor
on
the
theory
that
the
doctor
is
acting
colorado
state
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
why
not?
i
really
do
not
quite
get
your
theory.
is
it
because
it
ended
up
with
the
finding
that
there
was
no
state
action
or
is
it
because
it
was
a
frivolous
state
action
claim
or
there
is
a
difference
between
sterilization
and
segregation?
precisely
what
is
the
difference
between
this
and
the
kind
of
litigation
involved
in
button?
justice
john
paul
stevens
imagine
at
the
time
of
litigation,
it
grew
out
of
the
naacp
activities
under
quite
a
few
private
relationships.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
does
not
turn
on
the
kind
of
litigation
then,
that
turns
on
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
on
the
kind
of
compensation.
