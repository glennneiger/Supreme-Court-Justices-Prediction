mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
ray
mcclain
of
charleston,
south
carolina.
i
represent
edna
smith
of
columbia,
south
carolina,
a
member
of
the
bar
of
this
court
who
is
seated
to
my
left
this
morning.
ms.
smith
is
before
this
court
seeking
reversal
of
professional
disciplinary
punishment
imposed
on
her
for
advising
one
mary
etta
williams
that
the
services
of
the
american
civil
liberties
union
were
definitely
available
to
mrs.
williams,
with
whom
she
had
previously
consulted.
mrs.
williams
was
a
welfare
recipient
in
aiken,
a
small
community
in
south
carolina.
mrs.
williams
had
been
sterilized
in
early
july,
1973
as
a
condition
of
her
receiving
treatment
as
a
medicaid
patient
by
a
physician
in
aiken.
this
case
presents
important
questions,
both
under
the
first
amendment
and
the
due
process
clause,
the
due
process
clause
particularly
as
to
the
vagueness
of
the
rules
as
construed
by
the
court
below.
i
shall
limit
my
comments
here
to
those
issues
relating
to
various
aspects
of
the
first
amendment
concerned
and
rely
to
the
briefs
as
to
other
due
process
matters,
unless
the
court
has
specific
questions.
it
is
our
position
that
this
case
is
squarely
controlled
by
this
court’s
opinion
in
naacp
v.
button,
a
decision
in
which
the
organizational
activities
of
the
american
civil
liberties
union
were
expressly
referred
to,
and
referred
to
with
approval.
that
decision,
as
it
has
been
amplified
in
the
cases
of
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen
v.
virginia,
united
mine
workers
v.
illinois,
and
united
transportation
union
v.
michigan.
the
force
of
those
cases,
we
submit,
has
been
augmented
also
by
this
court’s
decision
last
term
in
bates
v.
the
state
bar
of
arizona,
where
the
court
extended
the
application
of
these
prior
associational
cases
to
protect
advertising
of
the
availability
and
price
of
legal
services.
based
on
these
prior
decisions
--
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
certainly
not
co-extensive,
but
to
the
extent
that
the
same
interests
of
providing
information
for
informed
decision
making
by
the
person
to
whom
the
information
is
directed.
first
amendment
concerns
are
equally
relevant.
the
balancing
of
interests
may
be
different.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
well,
in
the
first
place,
i
think
i
should
point
out
that
in
this
case
the
conduct
which
is
alleged
to
be
solicitation,
the
letter
which
was
written
by
ms.
smith,
was
not
a
face-to-face
confrontation
of
that
sort.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
right
and
with
respect
to
it,
i
think
that
clearly
anytime
there
is
a
face-to-face
confrontation,
there
are
other
factors
operating
that
are
not
operating
in
a
written
communication.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
i
think
it
is
closer
to
that
certain
event
than
an
in-person
solicitation.
the
scope
of
the
first
amendment
protection,
as
we
read
the
button
case
and
the
succeeding
cases,
is
that
it
protects
associational
activity
to
initiate
litigation
and
to
support
litigation
in
so
far
as
such
litigation
may
further
legitimate
goals
of
the
organization
by
assuring
meaningful
access
to
the
courts
and
that
meaningful
access
does
not
depend
on
whether
or
not
the
persons
who
are
being
informed
of
their
rights
are
members
of
the
association
or
not.
they
were
not
in
the
button
case.
obviously,
the
information
disseminated
in
the
bates
case
was
not
disseminated
to
any
particular
limited
association
or
group.
further,
attorneys
may
participate
in
such
organizational
and
associational
activities
with
a
similar
first
amendment
constitutional
protection.
indeed,
the
parallels
that
this
case
presents
with
the
button
case
are
very
striking.
a
very
important
activity
of
the
naacp
in
button
was
providing
legal
services.
the
court
said
it
had
an
extensive
program
of
providing
legal
services
to
aggrieved
parties
in
certain
types
of
cases.
that
is
similar
to
the
situation
here.
the
naacp
limited
the
scope
at
the
outset
of
its
undertaking
representation
of
anyone,
but
thereafter,
exercised
no
control
over
the
actual
conduct
of
the
litigation.
the
aclu
follows
a
similar
practice.
in
button,
attorneys
really
rather
aggressively
solicited
parties,
who
according
to
the
opinion
in
the
virginia
supreme
court
had
never
expressed
any
interest
in
litigating,
had
no
idea
they
would
be
met
by
an
attorney
when
they
went
to
various
community
meetings
and
yet
attorneys
were
there,
participating
in
the
attempt
to
persuade
people
at
these
meetings
to
join
lawsuits
to
attack
practices
of
segregation.
those
attorneys,
in
this
litigation
that
followed,
were
compensated
on
something
which
was
not
the
case
with
respect
to
aclu
attorneys.
the
matter
here,
as
in
button,
was
a
suit
attacking
government
practices
and
in
this
case,
the
provision
of
medicaid
services.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
the
record
does
not
really
reflect
that,
your
honor.
the
only
thing
that
is
clearly
reflected
by
the
record
is
that
one
gary
allen
who
had
organized
the
meeting
was,
according
to
mrs.
williams’
testimony,
advised
that
she
would
call
if
mrs.
williams
wanted
further
assistance.
the
record
is
not
clear
that
ms.
smith
was
ever
told
that.
the
attorney
general
at
the
hearing
never
asked
ms.
smith
whether
she
had
told
that.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
i
do
not
agree
with
that
characterization
of
the
letter,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the
record
is
clear
that
ms.
smith
wrote
a
letter.
i
do
not
believe
that
it
can
fairly
be
characterized
as
an
attempt
to
persuade
her.
in
her
testimony,
she
explicitly
stated
that
she
was
not
trying
to
persuade
anyone.
in
fact,
mrs.
williams
testified.
the
only
evidence
that
mrs.
williams,
the
person
allegedly
solicited,
had
on
the
question
of
persuasion
was
that
edna
smith
had
not
attempted
to
persuade
or
pressure
her
in
any
way
to
file
a
lawsuit.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
to
my
knowledge,
in
fact,
that
was
actually
probably
one
of
the
problems
in
button.
many
of
the
people
who
signed
retainer
agreements
did
not
even
know
that
lawsuits
were
going
to
be
filed
until
after
they
read
about
them
in
the
newspaper.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
to
my
knowledge,
i
know
of
none.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
that
is
the
letter
we
are
talking
about,
your
honor.
the
letter
goes
on
to
state
in
addition
in
the
next
paragraph,
in
fact
there
in
the
next
sentence
she
said
“we
will
be
coming
to
aiken
in
the
near
future
and
would
like
to
explain
what
is
involved,”
this
is
page
9
of
the
state’s
brief,
so
you
can
understand
what
is
going
on.
the
next
paragraph
proposes
a
magazine
interview
if
mrs.
williams
is
interested
in
publicizing
the
issue
of
forced
sterilizations,
which
ms.
smith
makes
quite
clear
that
it
is
totally
up
to
mrs.
williams
whether
she
would
participate
in
that
interview
or
not
and
asks
in
the
last
paragraph
about
the
lawsuit,
“if
you
are
interested,
let
me
know.”
there
is
really
no
persuasive
content
to
this
letter.
in
fact,
as
it
was
characterized
by
ms.
smith
in
her
testimony
before
the
hearing
panel,
this
letter
was
essentially
an
attempt
to
advise
mrs.
williams
that
the
aclu
would
in
fact
give
mrs.
williams
assistance
if
she
wanted
it.
we
have
to
take
into
consideration,
your
honor,
the
fact
that
mrs.
williams
was
relatively
uneducated,
that
ms.
smith
had
perceived
her
as
not
being
very
well-informed
about
her
rights
and
not
understanding
the
initial
conversation
very
well.
this
was
simply
a
letter
in
which
there
was
an
attempt
made
to
be
sure
mrs.
williams
had
considered
the
matter
fully
before
she
decided
what
she
was
going
to
do.
mrs.
williams,
shortly
thereafter,
called
ms.
smith
and
said
“i
am
not
interested
in
bringing
a
lawsuit”
and
that
was
the
end
of
it.
mrs.
williams
never
made
any
complaint
to
any
agency
that
she
had
been
pressured
by
ms.
smith
or
never
complained
in
any
way
about
ms.
smith’s
conduct.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
a
distinction
in
the
button
case.
that
is
what
happened
in
button.
people
solicited
clients
and
tried
the
cases
and
were
paid
for
them
which
aclu
cooperating
attorneys
were
not.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
i
think
that
this
case
is
less
extreme
than
button.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
the
distinction
between
commercial
and
non-commercial
speech
is
a
much
narrow
one.
your
honor’s
opinion
in
the
pittsburg
press
case,
for
example,
appears
to
characterize
commercial
speech
as
only
that
speech
which
has
no
other
purpose,
but
commercial.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
i
do
not
believe
that
makes
it
commercial
speech
and
that
has
been
true
in
the
pornography
and
obscenity
area
and
that
has
been
true
in
many
cases
before
this
court,
that
there
is
a
financial
element,
does
not
make
the
speech
per
se
commercial,
as
i
read
the
opinions.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
if
the
only
purpose
is
commercial,
as
in
the
case
that
was
just
argued
before
ours,
then
it
is
commercial
speech.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
i
would
certainly
think
that
is
commercial
speech,
your
honor.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
i
think
that
the
offer
of
goods
or
services
to
the
individual
who
is
offering
for
compensation,
i
do
not
think
the
offer
of
free
services,
for
example,
would
fairly
be
characterized
as
commercial.
in
fact,
that
is
the
distinction
that
i
believe
mr.
justice
powell
was
just
pointing
to,
that
were
the
client
charged
something
for
the
services
that
he
was
receiving,
would
that
make
it
commercial?
i
do
not
believe
that
it
would,
but
that
is
certainly
a
different
case
from
the
situation
that
the
aclu
has
consistently
practiced
and
that
there
has
never
been
any
change
presented
in
this
case.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
would
the
attorney
in
that
case
be
looking
to
seek
to
get
an
award
of
fees
from
the
defendant
on
some?
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
i
think
it
is
really
different
because
when
you
are
looking
to
get
compensation
from
a
corporation
in
which
the
person
holds
a
stock.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
no,
sir,
not
unless
it
were
successful,
but
just
the
fact
that
there
would
be
no
charge
to
the
litigation
was
my
position.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
no,
sir,
not
at
the
time
the
letter
was
written,
i
do
not
believe
the
record
supports
that.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
that
is
correct.
it
is
a
suit
for
money
damages,
but
that
all
would
go
to
the
client.
none
of
that
would
go
to
the
aclu
in
any
respect.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
that
might
be
ordered
by
the
court.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
but
in
a
different
sense,
--
one
important
factor
is
that,
for
example,
the
record
does
not
support
any
notion
that
ms.
smith
new
that
the
aclu
would
ask
for
attorney’s
fees
in
connection
with
any
litigation.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
sir,
i
am
sorry?
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
i
am
just
making
the
point
your
honor
that
the
record
in
this
case
does
not
reflect
that
ms.
smith
was
acting
in
a
fashion
to
get
money
for
the
aclu.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
i
think
it
is
protected.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
well,
one
of
the
things
that
the
state
court
relied
on
was
the
possibility
of
financial
benefit
to
the
organization,
making
it
a
non-exempt
organization.
i
did
not
find
that
persuasive,
but
that
was
relied
on
below.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
i
believe
that
is
the
way
it
started
out,
your
honor.
i
think
that
brings
me
back
to
the
point
which
i
wanted
to
make,
that
the
court
found
that,
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned.
the
aclu
has
only
entered
cases
in
which
substantial
civil
liberties
questions
are
involved.
so
with
respect
to
the
aclu’s
activities,
we
are
dealing
with
a
situation
where
even
if
some
fees
might
be
paid
to
them
eventually,
it
is
in
the
context
of
substantial
civil
liberties
litigation.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
the
constitutional
or
possibly
a
statutory
right
protecting
civil
liberties.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
for
example,
there
are
a
number
of
statues
which
are
deemed
to
enforce
provisions
of
the
bill
of
rights
or
interests
related
to
the
bill
of
rights,
certain
provision
of
the
omnibus
crime
control
act
involving
electronic
eves
dropping
or
aimed
at
the
same
interests
that
are
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
no,
sir,
that
is
not.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
well,
the
issue
that
was
raised
in
the
related
litigation
on
behalf
of
other
women
who
had
been
sterilized
by
this
doctor,
making
that
a
condition
a
receipt
of
governmentally
supported
services,
violated
the
federal
civil
rights
act
1983
and
1985.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
that
is
not
correct.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
the
patients
were
medicaid
patients
and
the
doctor
would
accept
them
as
medicaid
patients
only
if
they
would
accept
sterilization.
he
in
fact,
if
the
patient
were
able
to
pay,
he
would
not
require
sterilization
after
the
third
pregnancy,
but
that
is
what
he
would
require
with
respect
to
medicaid
patients.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
with
respect
with
this
doctor,
that
is
correct.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
that
is
my
understanding,
your
honor.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
that
is
my
understanding
of
that
record,
i
was
not
involved
in
that
case
myself.
i
would
simply
like
to
emphasize
that
the
state
concedes
that
the
first
meeting
at
which
ms.
smith
met
with
mrs.
williams
was
protected
and
in
its
brief
on
page
30,
it
says
it
was
protected
to
advise
her
of
her
legal
rights,
her
legal
remedies
and
of
the
availability
of
the
aclu.
we
find
it
difficult
to
see
why
a
letter
to
a
person
who
ms.
smith
did
not
perceive
to
fully
understand
her
rights
even
after
that
conversation,
a
single
letter
is
stripped
of
all
constitutional
protection,
once
that
first
concession
is
made
that
the
initial
meeting
was
a
protected
meeting.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
that
is
correct,
sir,
but
there
would
have
to
be
some
interest
like
that.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
that
is
correct.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
just
a
speech
which
is
extortion
in
nature
is
not
protected
at
all
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
agreed,
we
have
no
dispute
with
that.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
i
would
hardly
think
so.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
well
your
honor,
the
only
difference
is
advising
the
perspective
client
that
the
aclu
is
definitely
available
to
provide
counsel.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
one
of
the
problems
your
honor
is
that
solicitation
was
never
defined.
i
am
not
absolutely
clear
as
to
what
was
meant
by
solicitation,
it
was
not
the
recommending
of
her
own
services
because
she
was
not
found
guilty
of
2-103a.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
i
think
it
could
be
subject
to
that
interpretation.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
that
is
an
expression
of
an
opinion
about
it.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
it
is
a
speech
activity
commenting
on
an
issue
of
public
interest.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
that
is
correct.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
you
have
to
remember
that
the
letter
also
said
“if
you
are
interested,
let
me
know.”
it
does
invite
further
discussion.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
no,
but
it
also
did
not
say
“please
sign
this
letter
and
return
by
return
mail
and
we
will
represent
you”,
it
was
an
invitation
for
further
discussions
with
respect
to
the
conversation.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
two,
your
honor,
dr2-103d
which
as
you
commented
earlier,
involves
promoting
her
activities
and
2-104a5,
which
i
never
understood.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
that
has
been
my
understanding
in
my
argument
throughout
this
litigation,
your
honor,
but
the
state
court
below
did
not
accept
that.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
on
page
1a
of
the
jurisdictional
statements,
your
honor.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
it
says
she
was
found
guilty
of
violating
both
these
rules.
that
is
the
court
opinion.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
that
is
certainly
correct.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
yes,
sir.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
both
rules
are
referred
to
in
the
panel
report,
your
honor.
it
is
somewhat
opaque
to
me,
too.
i
think
perhaps
you
should
ask
mr.
kale
exactly
how
that
is
related.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
that
has
been
my
argument
all
along,
your
honor.
i
agree,
but
the
court
found
otherwise.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
i
am
really
not
sure,
your
honor.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
that
in
every
accepted
employment
which
was
the
original.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
it
requires
aiding
an
organization,
to
promote
her
services.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
that
is
the
way
i
had
been
reading
the
rules
all
along,
your
honor.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
i
do
not
believe
we
have
conceded.
she
did
not
agree
to
that,
your
honor.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
certainly.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
your
honor
i
do
not
want
to
make
a
concession
to
that
effect.
i
do
not
understand
precisely
what
soliciting
means
in
this
context.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
your
honor
my
understanding
is
that
a
disciplinary
rule
has
to
be
violated.
the
only
disciplinary
rule
that
talks
about
what
i
would
think
of
solicitation
is
dr2-103a,
which
is
the
recommending
of
the
employment
of
yourself
or
your
associates
and
104a
which
is
the
acceptance,
the
rules
that
are
clearly
involved
in
mr.
ohralik’s
case
and
neither
of
those
rules
are
involved
in
this
case.
so
it
is
hard
for
me
to
admit
that
this
is
a
solicitation
case
and
i
am
not
really
sure
exactly
what
the
interpretation
was.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
well,
your
honor
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
that
in
contrast
with
2-103a
which
talks
also
about
recommending
the
services
of
the
partners
and
associates.
although
it
was
argued
below,
she
was
not
found
to
have
recommended
those
services.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
now,
that
is
correct
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
exactly
what
the
court
said
in
button.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
that
is
certainly
the
principal
argument.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
except
with
respect
to
vagueness
of
whether
there
is
any
other
evidence
to
support
the
result.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
your
honor,
the
construction
that
is
placed
on
that
rule
in
the
state’s
brief
does
not
require
that
there
would
be
any
connection
between
her
associates
and
the
aclu
if
she
assists
or
cooperates
with
the
aclu
in
anyway,
she
cannot
offer
its
recommended
services
to
anyone
as
the
construction
that
is
put
on
this
rule
in
state’s
brief
at
page
49.
it
is
the
construction
that
i
have
understood
to
be
put
by
the
state
throughout.
that
is
what
makes
it
such
an
overbroad
rule
to
totally
prohibit
a
member
attorney
from
recommending
the
services
of
the
organization.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
question
about
that,
your
honor.
