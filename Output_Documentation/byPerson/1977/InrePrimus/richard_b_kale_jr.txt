mr.
richard
b.
kale,
jr.
yes,
sir,
mr.
justice
white,
it
is,
of
course,
our
claim
that
the
conduct
in
this
case
did
violate
dr2-103d
and
i
think
it
is
important
to
look
at
the
south
carolina
supreme
court's
--
mr.
richard
b.
kale,
jr.
it
violated
the
disciplinary
rule
because
it
recommended
the
services
of
the
aclu
which
has
as
members
cooperating
attorneys,
both
ms.
smith’s
private
law
partners,
one
was
a
staff
attorney
for
the
aclu
and
the
other
one
was
a
cooperating
attorney,
both
of
which
were
participants
in
the
subsequent
litigation
that
arose
out
of
these
events.
mr.
richard
b.
kale,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
kale,
jr.
the
associate
was
not
a
law
partner
of
the
firm?
mr.
richard
b.
kale,
jr.
i
do
not
quite
understand
what
you
mean
by
that.
mr.
richard
b.
kale,
jr.
yes,
sir.
the
court
and
counsel
--
mr.
richard
b.
kale,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
think
it
is
very
definite
that
they
had
established
a
firm
and
were
portraying
to
the
public
that
they
were
a
firm
and
that
they
were
partners
in
the
pursuit
of
their
legal
practice.
mr.
richard
b.
kale,
jr.
no,
sir.
it
also
provides
associates.
this
counsel
in
court
today
is
required
to
perform
the
unpleasant
task
of
examining
the
ethical
conduct
of
a
fellow
member
of
the
legal
profession.
appellant
smith,
who
is
a
licensed
attorney
in
the
state
of
south
carolina
was
found
by
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
to
have
violated
its
disciplinary
rules
and
was
publicly
reprimanded
for
this
conduct.
the
enforcement
of
disciplinary
rules,
while
perhaps
an
unpleasant
task,
is
a
necessary
one
for
the
protection
of
the
welfare
of
the
public
and
for
the
protection
of
the
administration
of
the
justice.
well,
indeed,
an
attorney’s
conduct
as
an
officer
of
the
court
does
reflect
upon
the
judicial
system.
this
court
has
long
recognized
the
right
and,
indeed,
the
necessity
of
the
states
to
regulate
the
practice
of
law
within
its
borders.
the
two
disciplinary
rules
which
the
court
found
appellant
smith
had
violated
were
disciplinary
rules
2-103d5
and
2-104a5
of
the
american
bar
association’s
code
of
professional
responsibility.
this
code
was
adapted
in
the
state
of
south
carolina
by
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
in
1973.
both
of
these
rules
concern
the
solicitation
of
business
by
a
lawyer.
however,
the
instant
case
involves
more
than
the
mere
recommendation
by
an
attorney
of
his
employment
or
the
employment
of
his
partners
or
associates.
the
instant
case
involves
the
question,
can
an
attorney
in
attempt
to
induce
or
persuade
a
perspective
client
to
bring
a
lawsuit
and
to
permit
the
attorney,
his
partner
or
his
associates
to
handle
the
case.
because
of
the
differing
factual
interpretations
in
this
case,
i
would
like
to
briefly
refer
to
the
record.
it
is
undisputed
that
mrs.
williams,
who
appellant
saw
as
a
client
for
the
american
civil
liberties
union,
had
not
requested
legal
assistance
from
ms.
smith
or
from
any
other
person.
in
july
of
1973,
a
meeting
was
arranged
by
appellant
smith
and
mr.
gary
allen
for
the
purpose
of
ms.
smith
advising
certain
women
about
the
sterilization
performed
upon
them
by
their
private
physician.
this
meeting
was
attended
by
members
of
the
press.
mrs.
williams
had
not
requested
this
meeting
and
in
fact,
did
not
know
of
the
meeting
until
she
was
approached
by
mr.
allen
as
she
left
the
hospital
where
her
child
was
critically
ill
and
was
not
expected
to
live.
mr.
allen
requested
mrs.
williams
to
accompany
him
to
meet
the
appellant.
ms.
smith
advised
mrs.
williams
about
her
legal
rights.
they
went
into
depth
about
the
sterilization
question.
she
told
her
of
her
legal
rights
and
remedies
and
she
even
advised
her
at
that
time
that
the
american
civil
liberties
union
could
render
legal
services
to
mrs.
williams.
mrs.
williams
left
the
meeting
after
informing
appellant
that
if
she
decided
to
bring
a
lawsuit,
she
would
contact
the
appellant.
mrs.
williams
never
contacted
ms.
smith
to
make
any
such
request.
it
is
a
position
of
the
state
that
the
appellant’s
further
attempt
to
secure
mrs.
williams
as
a
client
by
writing
the
letter
of
august
30,
1973
is
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment
and
is
clearly
prohibited
by
the
disciplinary
rules
in
question.
certainly,
when
mrs.
williams
left
the
meeting,
she
was
in
a
position
to
decide
her
own
best
interest
about
the
lawsuit.
to
permit
the
conduct,
in
this
case,
would
only
encourage
attorneys
to
be
persistent
with
potential
clients.
the
danger
of
committing
the
conduct,
i
think,
is
well
illustrated
by
the
testimony
of
mrs.
williams
which
i
would
like
to
quote
to
the
court.
she
said
“i
got
tired
of
everybody
aggravating
me.”
mr.
richard
b.
kale,
jr.
that
is
at
page
57
of
the
appendix.
“everyone
was
coming
to
ask
me,
was
i
not
going
to
file
a
lawsuit.
after
i
had
said
100
times
i
did
not
want
to
sue,
then
i
got
that
notion
that
maybe
if
i
did
sue
maybe
they
would
leave
me
alone.
i
am
tired
of
being
bothered.”
this
points
up,
i
think,
a
very
important
reason
for
having
rules
against
solicitation
in
that
people
ought
to
be
able
to
decide
whether
they
want
to
bring
a
lawsuit
or
select
an
attorney
without
pressure
or
any
type
of
inducement
by
an
attorney.
mr.
richard
b.
kale,
jr.
your
honor,
i
can
only
refer
to
the
decision
of
the
south
carolina
supreme
court.
they
did
not,
in
their
opinion,
find
any
misconduct
because
of
the
first
letter.
it
was
a
subsequent
seeking
of
the
client
that
they
found
was
irreprehensible
conduct.
mr.
richard
b.
kale,
jr.
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
it
is
necessary
that
the
organization
state
to
the
potential
client
that
they
desire
to
bring
it.
i
think
mrs.
williams
knew
at
the
time
she
was
advised.
mr.
richard
b.
kale,
jr.
your
honor,
under
my
reading
of
the
disciplinary
rules,
they
would
not
be
able
to
communicate
the
letter
even
if
they
had
not
advised
her
in
the
july
meeting.
mr.
richard
b.
kale,
jr.
not
through
personal
solicitation.
mr.
richard
b.
kale,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
do
not
believe
that
he
would
be
able
to
convey
to
the
organization.
mr.
richard
b.
kale,
jr.
no,
sir.
perhaps,
at
the
outset,
we
should
deal
with
appellant’s
argument
that
the
disciplinary
rules
in
this
case
are
overbroad.
of
course,
we
contend
that
the
activities
on
this
record
were
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
but
even
if
the
court
should
find
the
solicitation
by
attorneys
has
afforded
some
protection
under
first
amendment,
we
would
submit
to
the
court
that
such
would
be
commercial
expression
to
which
the
over-breadth
doctrine
applies
weakly
at
all.
as
the
court
noted
in
bates
v.
state
of
arizona,
commercial
expression
is
not
likely
to
be
crushed
by
such
restrictions.
we
would
urge
to
the
court
not
to
apply
over-breadth
to
the
case
of
solicitation
by
attorneys
as
they
decline
to
apply
it
to
professional
advertising.
the
litigation
which
appellant
sought
to
promote
in
this
case
was
an
action
for,
as
she
expressed
it,
money
against
mrs.
williams’
private
physician.
we
maintain
that
this
was
private
litigation
which
the
court
in
button
clearly
recognized
as
being
traditionally
condemned.
i
would
point
out
that,
last
week,
this
court
considered
another
sterilization
case
in
stump
versus
barton
in
which
a
daughter
had
been
sterilized
at
the
request
of
her
natural
mother
and
sole
parent.
regardless
of
whether
one
considers
the
mother’s
actions
in
that
case
to
be
right
or
wrong,
it
occurs
to
me
that
if
we
accept
the
appellant’s
argument
that
an
attorney
has
the
right
to
persuade
or
induce
potential
client
to
file
a
suit,
then
an
attorney
in
that
case
could
of
course
persuade
or
induce
the
daughter
to
file
a
suit
against
the
mother.
i
could
not
think
of
any
conduct
which
would
be
less
desirable
by
an
attorney.
mr.
richard
b.
kale,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
it
would
be
difficult
to
draw
a
disciplinary
rule
that
distinguished
between
a
conduct
on
the
basis
of
the
type
of
lawsuit
that
was
brought.
the
role
of
an
attorney
in
the
society
should
be
to
settle
disputes
and
not
assume
the
role
of
provoking
such
disputes.
the
court
in
button
clearly
recognized
the
undesirability
of
steering
up
litigation
which
interferes
with
established
relationships
as
in
this
particular
case,
the
relationship
between
a
private
physician
and
his
patient.
i
find
it
interesting
to
note
the
appellant’s
argument.
mr.
richard
b.
kale,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
you
can
if
it
is
a
private
relationship.
for
example
as
the
court
noted
in
naacp
v.
button,
a
litigation
which
would
solve
family
discord
or
litigation
which
interfered
with
private
relationships,
i
would
not
assume
that
the
relationship
between
a
stockbroker
and
his
client
would
be
such
a
private
relationship
as
between
a
physician
and
his
patient.
i
find
it
interesting
to
note
appellant’s
argument
that
what
she
was
trying
to
convey
to
mrs.
williams
in
her
august
30
letter
was
to
bring
action
against
government,
as
she
maintains.
if
you
look
at
the
letter,
this
was
not
what
she
told
mrs.
williams.
she
said
“the
aclu
would
like
to
file
a
lawsuit
on
your
behalf
for
money
against
the
doctor
who
performed
the
operation.”
the
letter,
i
think,
was
clearly
misleading
to
mrs.
williams
who
at
the
panel
hearing,
stated
that
she
had
only
been
told
by
appellant
that
the
only
thing
that
could
be
accomplished
by
the
lawsuit
was
to
get
money.
i
feel
that
the
letter
of
august
30th
was
clearly
an
inducement
to
mrs.
williams
with
the
prospect
of
receiving
money
to
allow
the
american
civil
liberties
union
to
file
a
suit
for
her.
mr.
richard
b.
kale,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
the
rules
in
question
specifically
have
excluded
the
court’s
line
of
decision
in
the
union
cases,
where
collective
activities
to
members
to
attain
access
to
the
legal
system
has
been
protected.
i
think
it
is
an
important
point
here
to
note
the
difference
in
that
mrs.
williams
was
not
a
member
of
the
organization.
there
was
no
protection
of
collective
activities
by
the
members
who,
i
think
in
the
court’s
decision
in
the
union
cases,
was
always
the
aggrieved
party
that
should
attain
access
to
the
court.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
court
ruled
in
the
union
cases
that
attorneys
can
participate
in
collective
activities
to
obtain
access
to
the
courts.
i
think
it
was
always
from
the
standpoint
of
the
aggrieved
parties
obtaining
access
to
the
court.
mr.
richard
b.
kale,
jr.
yes,
sir,
to
its
members.
mr.
richard
b.
kale,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
kale,
jr.
i
believe
you
are
right
your
honor.
i
think
another
important
consideration
that
you
have
in
this
case
which
justifies
the
prohibitions
of
solicitation
are
the
potential
conflicts
that
arise
with
an
organization
that
attempts
to
achieve
organizational
goals
through
litigation
and
their
representation
of
non-members.
certainly,
the
interest
of
the
organization
and
the
non-member
are
not
so
identical,
as
the
court
noted
in
naacp
v.
button
that
the
potential
conflicts
of
interest
cannot
arise.
mr.
richard
b.
kale,
jr.
we
can
not
prohibit
a
non-lawyer
under
the
disciplinary
rules,
from
doing
anything.
mr.
richard
b.
kale,
jr.
there
is
a
statute
in
south
carolina
prohibiting
solicitation.
mr.
richard
b.
kale,
jr.
your
honor,
i
cannot
say
for
sure.
i
do
not
think
there
has
ever
been
a
prosecution
that
i
know
of
under
that
criminal
statute.
mr.
richard
b.
kale,
jr.
yes,
sir.
lawyer’s
activities
are,
of
course,
proscribed
under
these
rules.
mr.
richard
b.
kale,
jr.
we
have
a
criminal
statute
in
the
state
of
south
carolina
which
prohibits
solicitation.
mr.
richard
b.
kale,
jr.
yes,
sir.
solicitation
of
legal
business,
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
kale,
jr.
yes,
sir.
[laughter]
mr.
richard
b.
kale,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
believe
that
is
correct.
however,
if
you
look
at
the
case
in
the
naacp
v.
button,
you
will
note
that
the
normal
way
that
the
naacp
obtained
clients
was
not
through
solicitation,
but
from
a
request
directly
by
the
client
to
the
naacp
except
in
desegregation
cases.
in
desegregation
cases,
the
naacp
undertook
a
program
in
order
to
implement
the
court’s
decisions
in
brown
v.
board
of
education
in
1954
and
subsequent
to
--
mr.
richard
b.
kale,
jr.
your
honor,
we
would
maintain
that
the
difference
being
that
the
action
in
desegregation
cases
were
actions
against
government.
here,
as
the
fourth
circuit
noted
in
the
subsequent
litigation
that
came
out
--
mr.
richard
b.
kale,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
you
would
have
to
look
at
the
view
as
far
as
the
disciplinary
actions
of
the
appellant
at
the
time
she
wrote
the
letter.
in
the
letter,
she
said
“we
would
like
to
file
an
action
for
money
against
the
doctor.”
mr.
richard
b.
kale,
jr.
if
we
have
to
go
one
step
further
and
say
“what
happened
in
subsequent
litigations,
did
we
not
envision
an
action
against
government?”
then,
i
think
you
would
have
to
take
it
maybe
one
step
further
and
say
that
“well,
maybe
we
have
to
wait
to
the
conclusion
of
the
litigation
to
determine
whether
this
was
in
fact
action
against
government.”
my
point
is,
as
far
as
this
particular
action,
i
do
not
believe
it
was
the
type
of
action
which
the
court
attempted
to
carve
out
any
type
of
exception.
no
more
so
than,
for
example,
if
an
individual
had
brought
a
suit
and
named
of
the
state
of
south
carolina
as
a
defendant
under
the
motor
vehicle
tort
claim
act.
mr.
richard
b.
kale,
jr.
your
honor,
the
difference
is
that
of
course
i
think,
it
interfered
with
a
private
relationship,
obtaining
a
relationship
--
mr.
richard
b.
kale,
jr.
yes
sir,
but
not
the
established
type
of
relationship
that
you
have
between
a
doctor
and
his
patient.
moreover,
the
type
of
litigation
that
they
had
in
button
did
not,
as
the
court
recognized,
have
any
financial
benefit
to
the
organization
which,
of
course,
it
has
in
this
particular
case
of
the
possibility
of
court
order
of
attorneys.
mr.
richard
b.
kale,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
kale,
jr.
well,
of
course
the
avon
lady
and
her
client
is
purely
a
commercial
type
of
relationship.
mr.
richard
b.
kale,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
think
it
is
the
professionalism
that
is
involved
in
the
particular
relationship
of
a
patient
and
his
doctor
which
requires
a
certain
amount
of
trust.
if
lawsuits
are
proscribed,
i
think
that,
very
seriously,
this
will
interfere
with
the
type
of
professional
relationship
they
have.
mr.
richard
b.
kale,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
kale,
jr.
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
the
court
intended
in
naacp
v.
button
to
give
the
naacp
a
complete
blanket
exemption
from
soliciting
clients.
mr.
richard
b.
kale,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
think
it
very
well
could
be.
mr.
richard
b.
kale,
jr.
what
was
the
specific
litigation
they
were
soliciting?
mr.
richard
b.
kale,
jr.
not
a
school
suit,
no,
sir
i
think.
mr.
richard
b.
kale,
jr.
do
you
mean
for
desegregation?
mr.
richard
b.
kale,
jr.
then,
i
think
you
are
of
course
getting
very,
almost
in
a
factual
situation
in
naacp
v.
button.
mr.
richard
b.
kale,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
of
course
the
type
of
conduct
that
was
involved
in
the
case
before
the
court
in
1963
which
the
court
i
think
very
closely
stated
that
they
were
limiting
their
decision
to
the
record
on
the
court.
mr.
richard
b.
kale,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
this
point,
i
think
i
would
like
to
make
some
brief
summary
marks
and
close
my
argument
and
i
would
like
to
urge
the
court
to
consider
in
the
facts
of
this
case
that
the
perspective
client,
mrs.
williams,
had
been
advised
prior
to
the
august
letter
from
appellant
smith
of
her
legal
rights
and
remedies
and
availability
of
the
aclu
to
represent
her.
appellant
smith,
in
her
testimony
before
the
grievance
committee,
testified
that
in
her
letter
she
was
seeking
members
of
the
plaintiff
class
so
that
the
american
civil
liberties
union
could
have
clients.
i
would
submit
that
the
first
amendment
was
not
intended
to
protect
or
afford
the
attorney
a
right
to
secure
the
client.
we
would
respectfully
request
that
this
court
consider
these
facts
and
affirm
the
decision
of
the
south
carolina
supreme
court.
thank
you.
