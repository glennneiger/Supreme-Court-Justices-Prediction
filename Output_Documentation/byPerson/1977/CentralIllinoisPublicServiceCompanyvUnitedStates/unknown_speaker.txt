unknown
speaker
ms.
king,
let
me
ask
a
question
or
two
if
i
may
--
we
are
concerned
here
with
1963
liability
are
we
not?
unknown
speaker
does
that
mean
that
we
have
the
same
issue
after
every
year
since
that
time,
14
years?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
claimed
element
of
bad
faith
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
has
the
government
attempted
to
tax
these
items
to
the
individual
employees
so
far
as
you
know?
unknown
speaker
successfully.
unknown
speaker
it
is
a
government’s
regulation?
unknown
speaker
ms.
king,
may
i
interrupt
you
to
be
sure,
i
had
follow
this
argument?
is
this
the
regulation
that
provides
the
authority
for
excluding
the
amounts
paid
on
overnight
trips
from
wages?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
am
talking
about
your
company’s
practice
of
not
including
and
you
do
include
them
whether
they
are
overnight
or
not?
unknown
speaker
the
government
agrees
that
you
properly
exclude
the
reimbursements
in
so
far
as
they
relate
to
overnight
trips,
right?
unknown
speaker
and
it
is
the
reason
they
agree
that
that
is
proper
based
on
this
regulation?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
does
it
not
you
are
questioning
about
the
difference
between
employer
and
employee
equally
raise
a
question
about
that
practice?
unknown
speaker
there
is
statute
or
it
did
not
say
anything
about
that?
unknown
speaker
no,
nor
does
the,
does
any
other
statute
say
--
unknown
speaker
162
does
not
say
anything
about
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
away
from
home,
but
nothing
about
overnight?
unknown
speaker
over
a
substantial
dissent.
it
is
a
large
percentage
of
the
decision
to
this
part.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
not
issue,
whether
the
overnight
concept
is
incorporated
in
this
regulation?
is
that
not
the
very
thing
we
have
to
decide?
unknown
speaker
perhaps
they
should
have
written
a
narrower
opinion
but
perhaps
that
does
not
really
is
dispositive
with
the
question
how
you
decide
the
case,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
ms.
king,
at
the
outset
you
made
a
point
of
emphasizing
that
unlike
the
previous
case
this
was
not
an
income
tax
case,
this
is
a
withholding
tax
case.
unknown
speaker
does
that,
may
i
properly
infer
from
that
point
that
you
so
emphasized
that
even
if
you
prevail,
and
even
therefore,
if
your
client
need
not
withhold
these
payments,
they
may
nonetheless
be
income
to
the
employees?
unknown
speaker
i
will
put
another
way
wages
may
not
mean
the
same
as
income?
unknown
speaker
or
the
statutes
said
so?
unknown
speaker
income
includes
wages
among
many
other
things?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
when
do
you
think
government
put
tax
payers
fairly
on
notice
as
to
its
policy?
unknown
speaker
pretty
good
tax
lawyer
to
understand
what
that
means?
unknown
speaker
if
it
is
a
small
businessman
where
no
tax
lawyer
would
ever
understand
that?
unknown
speaker
going
back
to
correll,
do
you
think
that
constituted
notice
in
that
event?
unknown
speaker
until
when?
at
least
they
learned
the
government’s
position
until
when?
unknown
speaker
certainly,
no
later
than
the
decision
of
court
of
appeals
in
the
seventh
circuit
was
made?
unknown
speaker
just
plainly
a
notice,
at
least
the
people
in
the
seventh
circuit?
unknown
speaker
ms.
king,
but
would
not
the
1969
ruling
have
given
notice
to
those
who
really
understood
it
and
read
it
carefully
that
there
was
a
problem
in
this
area?
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
telling
about
the
--
unknown
speaker
the
obligation
to
withhold.
unknown
speaker
and
that
obligation
only
applies
to
wages.
unknown
speaker
that
obligation
only
applies
to
wages?
unknown
speaker
the
statutory
obligation.
unknown
speaker
and
does
that
not
seem
reasonable
if
they
say
you
do
not
have
to
withhold
if
you
expect
the
employee
to
have
an
offsetting
deduction
that
the
converse
is
says,
we
do
expect
to
withhold,
if
you
do
not
think
he
does
have
an
offsetting
deduction?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
not
talking
about
the
merits
of
whether
it
is
wise,
i
understand
your
argument
there
but
just
in
terms
of
the
notice
point,
your
strongest
argument
is
it
not,
it
is
for
the
period
from
the
'63-'69,
of
course,
we
have
'63
here?
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
but
it
seems
to
me,
after
'69
you
may
or
may
not
be
able
to
make
the
same
argument,
that
is
all
i
was
suggesting.
unknown
speaker
right.
yeah.
unknown
speaker
but
why
do
you
focus
on
gross
income
when
you
have
got
a
specific
statutory
definition
of
wages?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
would
be
fine
if
you
are
drafting
the
thing
yourself
but
congress
has
already
spoken
and
does
--
am
i
not
right
in
thinking
that
all
wages
as
income
is
grossly
--
unknown
speaker
but
congress
did
not
--
unknown
speaker
but
for
the
--
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
really
need
to
make
the
--
unknown
speaker
you
can
say
the
same
thing
about
somebody
that
goes
to
a
heated
office
on
a
cold
day
and
works.
there
is
an
inescapable
connection
between
working
in
that
office
and
getting
heat,
but
that
does
not
necessarily
make
heat,
as
part
of
the
wages?
unknown
speaker
then
you
are
doing
the
distinction
because
between
that
which
is
capable
easily
of
valuation
and
that
which
is
not?
unknown
speaker
the
employer
deducts
it?
unknown
speaker
all
those
things
do
fall
within
the
literal
meaning
of
this
sentence
on
page
20
that
just
called
to
our
attention
by
your
sister
on
the
other
side?
unknown
speaker
that
whatever
it
has
been,
the
mens
and
ladies
rooms
and
everything?
unknown
speaker
that
is
your
brief
--
-
unknown
speaker
this
is
your
brief,
as
that
your
brief
trying
to
prevail
in
that
theory
and
this
is
what
you
told
us?
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith
i
think
you
have
already
answered
the
question
i
am
going
to
ask,
but
i
do
not
quite
have
it
clearly
in
mind.
let
us
assume
that
one
of
these
employees
had
drove
his
car
50
miles
for
his
job
site
on
a
particular
day
and
was
provided
reimbursement
for
his
lunch
and
for
his
mileage,
i
recognize
that
the
regulation
341
(a)
etcetera,
refers
to
travel
expenses
explicitly,
is
that
the
basis
for
distinction
between
the
two?
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
had
to
travel
facts
i
have
of
that
stated
what
is
--?
unknown
speaker
the
mileage
would
be
compensation?
unknown
speaker
if
then
you
sent
him
down
to
fredericksburg
that
day
would
that
be
analogous
to
commuting
from
chevy
chase
or?
unknown
speaker
but
not
to
meal
he
ate
in
fredericksburg?
unknown
speaker
this
is
an
awfully
poor
way
of
saying
overnight,
just
to
say
all
traveling
expenses?
unknown
speaker
that
overnight
rule
for
what,
not
for
this
purpose?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
37
years
old,
it
looks
like
he
could
have
incorporated
in
these
regulations?
unknown
speaker
what
he
did
not
--
i
would
think
he
meant
not
to?
unknown
speaker
that
what
your
entitled
to?
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith,
apart
from
this
general
language
in
this
regulation
and
the
correll
case,
is
there
anything
before
1969,
that
would
reasonably
put
companies
like
this,
a
notice
as
to
wages,
that
you
are
going
apply
an
overnight
rule
on
withholding
the
wages?
unknown
speaker
that
does
not
--
that
does
important
as
if
there
old
case
holding
it
is
not
income,
our
fortiori
would
not
be
wages
--
unknown
speaker
that
does
not
follow
that
because
of
the
change
of
the
law
on
income
is
made
does
not
follow
that
also
changed
the
law
--
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
deductible?
unknown
speaker
that
was
deductible
and
therefore
could
be
excluded
from
income?
unknown
speaker
but
that
has
--
that
the
fact
that
was
the
law,
the
change
in
that
rule
would
not
necessarily
also
require
a
change
in
the
rule
applicable
to
wages?
unknown
speaker
no,
no
they
could
rely
on
that
because
it
was
--
it
what
was
deductible
and
therefore
not
includable
as
income,
surely
it
would
not
be
subject
to
withholding?
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
point
deducting
this?
you
do
not
deduct
something
if
you
do
not
first
report
this
out?
unknown
speaker
gross
income.
unknown
speaker
the
other
side
of
it
realistically
as
you
have
large
companies
all
over
the
country
with
problems
like
this.
they
have
no
motivation
not
to
withhold
as
i
understand
the
government’s
position
clearly.
do
they?
unknown
speaker
what
in
fact
did
the
large
company’s
do
probably
in
1969?
unknown
speaker
any
litigation
instituted
by
the
commissioner
to
--?
unknown
speaker
and
that
went
the
other
way?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
what
is
the
date
of
royster,
it
is
in
the
brief,
but
i
do
not
have
it?
