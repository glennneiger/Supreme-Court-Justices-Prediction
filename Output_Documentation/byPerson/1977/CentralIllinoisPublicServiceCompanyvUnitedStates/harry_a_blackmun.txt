justice
harry
a.
blackmun
three
months
ago,
on
november
29,
this
court
in
a
case
called
commissioner
against
kowalski,
held
that
meal
allowance
payments
made
by
the
state
of
new
jersey
to
which
state
police
troopers,
were
includeable
in
gross
income
under
section
61
(a)
of
the
1954
internal
revenue
code,
and
the
tax
year
in
question
of
that
that
litigation
was
1970.
the
present
case
which
comes
to
us
from
the
legislate
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit,
concerns
another
aspect
of
meal
allowances.
the
question
in
this
one
is
whether
an
employer,
who
in
1963
reimbursed
lunch
expenses
of
employees
who
were
on
company
travel,
but
not
away
overnight,
must
withhold
federal
income
tax
on
those
reimbursements
or
stated
another
way,
the
issue
is
whether
the
lunch
reimbursement
is
codified
as
wages
under
section
3401
(a)
of
the
54
code.
this
of
course
is
a
question
different
from
their
qualifying
as
an
income,
as
the
court
decided
in
kowalski,
for
many
items
that
are
income
and
not
necessarily
wages,
examples
are
dividends
and
interest.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
hold
that
reimbursement
for
1963
lunch
expenses
did
not
constitute
wages
within
the
meaning
of
section
3401
(a).
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
separate
opinion,
joining
the
court's
opinion,
and
emphasizing
that
we
don't
decide
whether
a
new
internal
revenue
service
regulation
that
would
require
withholding
would
or
wouldn't
be
valid
and
further
emphasizing
that
the
petitioner
here
couldn't
be
subjective
retroactively
to
withholding
tax.
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
powell
have
joined
mr.
justice
brennan
in
that
opinion.
mr.
justice
powell
has
also
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
he
joins
a
court's
opinion
and
observes
that
it
seems
particularly
inappropriate
for
the
commissioner,
absent
express
statutory
authority,
to
impose
retroactively
a
tax
prior
to
the
date
on
which
taxpayers
clearly
were
put
on
notice
of
the
liability.
the
chief
justice
has
also
joined
mr.
justice
powell's
decision.
mr.
justice
stewart
has
filed
a
separate
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
