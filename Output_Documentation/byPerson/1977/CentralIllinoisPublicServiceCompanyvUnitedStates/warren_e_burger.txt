we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
1058,
central
illinois
public
service
against
the
united
states.
ms.
king,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice

e.
burger
well,
i
suppose,
it
seems
to
be
pretty
difficult
to
handle
the
accounting
and
charging
people
for
the
amount
of
heat
that
they
absorbed
or
the
light
that
they
used.
i
will
give
you
a
more
concrete
one
to
you.
suppose
it
would
include
a
thanksgiving
turkey,
so
that
if
the
employer
gave
a
thanksgiving
turkey
to
every
employee
that
was
worth
$20,
i
suppose
these
days,
he
would
have
to
withhold
from
their
paycheck,
whatever
is
the
tax
on
$20?

mr.
smith.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
ask
you
about
one
more
concrete
and
readily
measurable,
the
15
minute
coffee
break
with
unlimited
coffee
today
its
$0.25
is
it
not
for
a
cup
of
coffee,
an
average
employee
might
readily
have
two
cups
of
coffee
charging
$0.50
of
wages
or
for
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
the
western
and
southern
states
in
the
logging
operations
where
lumberjacks
do
not
usually
leave
right
at
this
size
of
the
work.
the
general
practice
is
that
a
bus
comes
around
to
the
dormitory
/barracks
where
the
lumberjacks
stay,
pick
them
all
up
at
the
same
time,
take
them
up,
graft
them
up
with
the
various
work
sites
and
they
get
the
travel
to
and
from
work
and
of
course
they
get
all
their
meals
and
it
is
included
to,
is
meals
taxable,
is
the
bus
drive
taxable.
chief

you
know
what
irs
is
in
fact
doing

that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
includable
as
income
but
it
is
deductible?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further
ms.
king?
chief
justice

you

case

and
