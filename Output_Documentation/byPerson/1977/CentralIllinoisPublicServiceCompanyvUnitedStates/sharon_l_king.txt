ms.
sharon
l.
king
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
unlike
the
prior
case,
does
not
present
an
income
tax
question.
it
is
a
withholding
tax
case,
it
involves
the
scope
of
the
withholding
tax
provisions
and
primarily
the
definition
of
the
term
wages,
an
item
is
not
subject
to
withholding
unless
it
is
a
wage
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
basically
agreed
upon
the
petitioner,
a
public
utility
company
reimbursed
its
employees
in
the
year
1963
for
expenses
which
they
incurred
in
traveling
on
required
trips
on
the
company’s
business.
the
petitioner
used
the
same
method
of
reimbursement,
it
reimbursed
on
the
same
basis
for
overnight
and
non-overnight
trips.
the
government’s
contention
is
that
petitioner
should
have
withheld
on
the
reimbursement
payments
which
were
made
to
employees
for
mail
expenses
incurred
on
non
overnight
trips
and
there
is
no
question
that
withholding
is
required
on
any
of
the
other
reimbursement
payments.
ms.
sharon
l.
king
that
is
correct.
yes,
the
district
court
held
for
petitioner,
it
concluded
that
the
government’s
requirement
of
withholding
on
the
non-overnight
trip,
meal
reimbursements
was
a
departure
from
the
realities
of
business
life
in
a
vigorous
stretching
of
the
statute.
the
seventh
circuit
reversed
and
in
reversing
held
in
effect
that
virtually
every
item
arising
out
of
the
employment
relationship
should
be
included
in
the
withholding
base
and
should
be
subject
to
withholding.
ms.
sharon
l.
king
yes,
that
is
correct.
ms.
sharon
l.
king
there
are
prospective
years.
they
are
not
before
the
court.
ms.
sharon
l.
king
no.
ms.
sharon
l.
king
yes,
it
has.
ms.
sharon
l.
king
yes,
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
arons
case
is
a
case
which
involves
one
of
the
petitioner’s
employees.
employee
arons
paid
the
tax
and
then
sued
for
a
refund,
questioning
whether
the
amount
was
even,
questioning
whether
he
had
an
offsetting
income
tax
deduction,
in
the
years
prior
to
this
case,
the
government
did
pursue
the
employees,
but
it
is
obviously
much
easier
to
pursue
the
employer,
and
so
that
is
why
the
change
in
1963.
ms.
sharon
l.
king
every
item
of
the
reimbursement
is
deemed
to
fall
within
the
broad
definition
of
gross
income,
but
there
is
an
offsetting
deduction
for
these
items
so
that
the
effect
is
and
it
is
generally
considered
that
these
items
are
not
income,
but
they
are
treated
as
taxable
income
and
then
subject
to
an
offsetting
income
tax
deduction.
ms.
sharon
l.
king
i
suppose
it
would
have
a
claim,
but
as
a
practical
matter
just
be
impossible
--
ms.
sharon
l.
king
--
to
pursue
all
of
these
people.
if
the
withholding
statute
is
interpreted
as
the
seventh
circuit
interpreted
and
as
the
government
contends
here
to
include
every
economic
benefit
arising
out
of
employment
relationship,
the
effect
will
be
that
almost
every
employer
in
this
country
would
be
in
violation
of
the
withholding
tax
provisions.
ms.
sharon
l.
king
yes,
i
do
as
a
matter
of
fact
on
page
20
of
their
brief,
in
the
second
full
paragraph
the
last
sentence,
the
government
says
the
statutory
concept
of
wages
is
not
tied
to
the
performance
of
any
particular
service,
but
includes
any
personal
economic
benefit
given
by
an
employer
to
its
employee
as
a
result
of
the
employment
relationship.
ms.
sharon
l.
king
that
is
a
possible
interpretation
if
we
are
talking
about
every
economic
benefit.
if
every
economic
benefit
is
included,
the
problems
are
enormous
and
first
of
all
identifying
what
is
the
withholding
base
such
as
heating,
and
air
conditioning
and
comfortable
offices
--
ms.
sharon
l.
king
telephones.
after
identifying
them,
there
are
valuation
problems,
where
there
are
non
cash
items
involved
and
there
are
all
sorts
of
problems
in
determining
whether
the
regulations
which
exclude
or
exempt
items
from
the
definition
of
wages
are
still
applicable.
ms.
sharon
l.
king
right,
there
is
an
exemption
or
an
exclusion
under
the
regulations
now
for
facilities
and
services
that
is
courtesy
discounts
or
a
medical
center
or
related
things,
but
of
course,
if
every
economic
benefit
is
included,
it
does
raise
a
question
on
what
the
effect
of
that
regulation
might
be.
ms.
sharon
l.
king
yes.
ms.
sharon
l.
king
even
greater
significance,
there
is
a
regulation
with
respect
to
reimbursements
for
travel
expenses
and
i
would
like
to
say
that
in
both
the
lower
courts
held
that
the
amounts
here
involved
are
reimbursements
for
legitimate
travel
expenses.
that
is
not
a
fair
question.
this
regulation
is
so
important
to
this
case
and
i
would
like
to
read
it.
it
is
on
page
12
of
our
opening
brief
which
is
the
blue
covered
brief.
it
is
at
the
top
of
that
page,
says
traveling
and
other
expenses
amounts
paid
specifically
either
as
advances
or
reimbursements
for
traveling
or
other
bona
fide,
ordinary
and
necessary
expenses
incurred
or
reasonably
expected
to
be
incurred
in
the
business
of
the
employer
are
not
wages
and
are
not
subject
to
withholding.
we
think
this
regulation
should
dispose
off
this
case.
the
government
does
not
challenge
the
validity
of
the
regulation.
ms.
sharon
l.
king
yes,
it
is
and
it
has
been
in
the
regulations,
since
the
early
1940s
when
the
present
withholding
tax
provisions
were
adopted.
the
present
withholding
tax
provisions
were
adopted
in
1942
and
1943,
and
this
came
in
at
1943
and
has
been
there
ever
since.
the
government
contends
though
that
this
regulation
should
be
read
to
apply
only
to
reimbursements
or
allowances
where
the
employee
is
not
entitled
to
an
offsetting
business
deduction,
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
regulation
that
says
that.
the
government
does
point
to
the
ordinary
and
necessary
language
which
it
says
refers
back
to
section
162
and
the
employee’s
deduction,
but
section
162
applies
to
employers
as
well
as
it
applies
to
employees
and
further
these
regulations
are
written
for
employers.
it
is
the
employer’s
obligation
to
withhold
which
is
involved
and
so
there
in
terms
of
as
these
regulation
says
amounts
paid
as
advances
or
reimbursements
not
amounts
received
an
ordinary
and
necessary
expenses
incurred
or
reasonably
expected
to
be
incurred
in
the
business
of
the
employer
not
the
business
of
the
employee,
as
mr.
smith
said
earlier,
those
are
two
different
things.
the
government
in
this
case
has
essentially
--
ms.
sharon
l.
king
this
regulation
applies
to
exclude,
if
you
are
talking
about
the
correll
case
no
it
did
not.
ms.
sharon
l.
king
that
is
correct.
ms.
sharon
l.
king
yes.
ms.
sharon
l.
king
yes,
that
is
correct.
ms.
sharon
l.
king
well,
i
think
that,
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly,
this
regulation
is
significant,
because
it
uses
the
word
traveling,
it
does
not
use
the
words
travel
away
from
home.
the
employee’s
deduction
under
section
162
is
based
on
language
allowing
him
a
deduction
for
travel
away
from
home
and
it
is
--
ms.
sharon
l.
king
no,
the
withholding
statute
says
nothing.
ms.
sharon
l.
king
that
is
correct.
ms.
sharon
l.
king
yes,
it
says
travel
away
from
home,
section
162
does.
ms.
sharon
l.
king
no,
but
this
court
correll
interpreted
the
away
from
home
language
to
mean
away
from
home
overnight,
but
the
--
ms.
sharon
l.
king
but
the
away
from
home
concept
is
not
incorporated
in
these
regulations
and
this
is,
i
think
is
of
particular
significance
because
the
government
claims
that
its
overnight
theory
was
established
just
about
the
time,
about
three
years
prior
to
the
time,
this
regulation
was
issued.
ms.
sharon
l.
king
well,
i
think
the
issue
is
--that
is
what
brings
the
case
to
this
court,
but
i
think
the
issue
is
broader
than
that
and
that
is
that
if
--
if
travel
expense
reimbursements
are
included
in
the
withholding
base
because
of
the
theory
that
every
economic
benefit
arising
out
of
the
employment
relationship
should
be
treated
as
a
wage
subject
to
withholding
that
is
really
the
question
which
is
involved
and
that
was
the
basis
for
the
seventh
circuit’s
holding.
ms.
sharon
l.
king
that,
i
think
that
is
the
seventh
circuit’s
view
and
that
is
the
view
which
the
government
is
spousing
here,
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
withholding
provisions
which
draw
a
distinction
between
overnight
and
non-overnight
and
i
would
like
to
go
on
and
say
that
the
government
arrives
that
its
theory
by
attempting
an
equivalence
between
the
broad
definition
of
gross
income
in
the
income
tax
provisions
and
the
more
narrow
term
'wages'
in
the
withholding
tax
provision.
it
does
this
although
the
word
'income'
does
not
appear
in
the
withholding
tax
statute.
at
one
time
many
years
ago,
when
the
one
of
the
initial
withholding
tax
statutes
was
adopted,
this
was
in
the
tariff
of
1913,
congress
did
try
for
an
all
inclusive
withholding
provision
and
in
that
provision
among
other
things
they
included
all
annual
gains,
profits
and
income
as
it
turned
out
that
the
department
of
treasury
was
soon
back
to
congress
saying
or
having
difficulty
with
collections
and
furthermore
those
that
are
made
are
erroneous
and
excessive
and
its
causing
us
a
great
burden,
so
in
1942
when
the
present
withholding
system
was
adopted,
congress
still
had
the
option
to
go
to
income,
but
it
did
not,
it
went
to
the
term
'wages'.
ms.
sharon
l.
king
yes.
ms.
sharon
l.
king
yes,
yes
that
is
correct.
ms.
sharon
l.
king
that
is
correct
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
government’s
own
rulings
have
so
said
--
ms.
sharon
l.
king
and
the
statute
so
says.
ms.
sharon
l.
king
yes,
that
they
are
not
synonymous
terms.
the
government
in
a
number
of
ruling
says
found
in
various
situations
that
an
employee
may
have
an
income
resolved
from
a
payment
he
receives,
but
the
employer
does
not
have
a
withholding
obligation
and
the
uniformly
cited
cases
up
to
the
seventh
circuit’s
decisions
below
in
the
court
of
claims
and
two
circuit
courts
have
held
that
the
income
tax
treatment
to
the
employee
is
immaterial
in
determining
the
scope
of
the
withholding
tax
provisions.
i
think
it
is
also
significant
that
while
the
government
places
considerable
emphasis
on
the
this
court’s
decision
in
the
lebot
case
in
1956
which
was
a
gross
income
case,
it
did
not
consider
withholding.
the
rulings
which
the
government
issued
saying
that
just
because
there
was
an
item
of
income,
does
not
mean
the
employer
must
withhold,
came
for
the
most
part
after
that
decision
was
issued.
so
obviously,
they
were
well
aware
that
what
the
gross
income
section
say,
does
not
influence
what
the
withholding
tax
provisions
are.
the
government
does
cite
a
decision
of
this
court,
the
nierotko
case
in
1946,
which
does
involve
withholding
and
i
think
it
deserves
special
mention.
that
case
involved
the
question
of
whether
social
security
tax
withholding
was
required
on
an
award
of
back
pay
to
improperly
discharged
employees.
the
court
held
that
it
was,
but
back
pay
is
not
the
same
as
remuneration
for
a
travel
expense
or
as
a
payment
of
a
travel
expense
reimbursement
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
social
security
regulations,
there
is
a
provision
such
as
the
one,
i
have
read
earlier
on
travel
expense
reimbursements
it
was
--
it
is
identical
today,
it
was
substantially
the
same
in
1946,
saying
that
reimbursements
are
not
wages
subject
to
withholding.
obviously
this
court’s
decision
on
the
back
pay
question
that
was
not
intended
to
overrule
that
regulation
and
did
not
do
so,
that
regulation
continues
have
force
in
effect.
the
government
has
somewhat
modified
its
pure
equivalence
argument
between
income
and
wages
by
contending
that,
that
the
equivalence
does
not
apply
if
the
employee
is
entitled
to
an
offsetting
income
tax
deduction.
it
is
not
clear
how
the
government
finds
support
for
this
in
its
withholding
provisions,
it
is
not
there.
it
is
also
not
clear
how
the
government
thinks
this
system
would
work.
it
suggests
that
every
employee
would
take
on
the
burden
of
determining
what
the
income
tax
deductions
of
each
of
its
employees
is
likely
to
be
and
not
on
a
payment
by
payment
basis,
but
it
would
look
on
an
aggregate
basis
for
the
entire
year
and
try
to
take
into
account
trips
which
might
arise
based
on
unforeseeable
events
in
the
company’s
business.
it
might
have
to
take
in
all
sorts
of
considerations,
but
the
point
is
that
it
would
be
up
to
the
employer
to
somehow
decide
what
the
income
tax
deductions
would
be
for
each
of
its
many
employees
and
for
an
employer
such
as
the
petitioner
with
thousands
of
employees,
this
is
simply
an
administrative
nightmare.
so,
basically
that
the
point
we
want
to
make
is
that
the
government
in
arguing
the
income
tax
cases
has
confused
the
issue
here,
it
is
not
an
income
tax
case,
it
is
a
withholding
tax
case
and
the
withholding
tax
provisions
must
govern.
we
believe
that
the
withholding
tax
provisions
are
quite
clear.
the
congress
intended
that
wages
be
a
narrow
term
and
furthermore,
the
regulations
which
have
been
in
--
which
have
been
on
the
books
since
the
very
outset
of
the
withholding
provisions,
preclude
the
inclusion
in
the
withholding
base
of
reimbursements
for
legitimate
travel
expences.
there
is
a
second
issue
in
this
case
which
involves
the
question
of
whether
the
--
a
change
in
the
--
an
administrative
view
about
the
withholding
tax
provisions
can
be
imposed
retroactively
against
an
employer.
in
1963,
when
these
payments
were
made,
there
was
not
one
regulation,
or
ruling,
or
court
case
which
would
have
suggested
that
these
reimbursement
payments
were
subject
to
the
withholding
tax
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
regulation
said
quite
the
contrary.
the
government
seems
to
concede
in
its
brief
that
if
there
is
a
factual
or
legal
basis
on
which
an
employer
involved,
by
that
withholding
was
not
required,
it
is
then
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
retroactively
impose
withholding
on
the
employer,
and
we
believe
this
is
clearly
this
case.
it
would
be
an
abuse
to
retroactively
impose
a
withholding
requirement.
the
employer
after
all
acts
only
as
an
agent
for
the
government
and
this
does
not
involve
the
employer’s
tax,
it
is
merely
collecting
taxes
to
assist
the
government.
ms.
sharon
l.
king
well,
i
think
that
probably
the
first
published
announcement
came
in
1969
in
its
revenue
ruling
69592
and
in
that
revenue
ruling
the
government
said
that
if
an
employer
reasonably
believes
that
at
the
time
he
makes
the
payment
that
the
employers
--
the
employees
offsetting
deductions,
will
equal
or
exceed
for
the
entire
year.
the
amount
of
the
reimbursements
which
he
will
receive
then
withholding
is
not
required.
ms.
sharon
l.
king
yes
it
does.
ms.
sharon
l.
king
i
think,
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
any
small
business
without
having
sophisticated
tax
advice
to
know
what
that
meant.
ms.
sharon
l.
king
no,
i
do
not.
the
correll
case
was
specifically
an
income
tax
case
and
given
the
fact
that
and
i
might
say
that
correll
was
never
asked
to
consider
the
withholding
tax
provisions
that
never
came
up,
but
given
the
fact
that
even
at
the
time,
the
correll
case
was
decided
that
there
were
these
regulations
or
there
were
the
government’s
rulings,
most
of
which
were
issued
in
the
1950s
and
at
the
time
of,
well,
shortly
after
correll,
there
were
a
number
of
cases
saying
that
that
the
income
tax
treatment
to
the
employee
is
immaterial.
i
think,
given
all
of
that
even
sophisticated
tax
counsel
would
have
been
hard
pressed
to
have
found
a
withholding
obligation.
ms.
sharon
l.
king
well,
until
they
learned
that
the
government’s
position,
i
suppose
when
this
case
began
to
come
to
the
forefront
particularly,
now
the
district
court
decided
for
the
petitioner
so
it
was
really
not
seventh
circuit
decision
came
out.
ms.
sharon
l.
king
yes,
but
even
then
it
is
such
a
broad
opinion
that
i
expect
that
not
--
ms.
sharon
l.
king
yes,
but
i
do
not
know
that
every
employer
is
that
withholding
on
the
air
conditioning,
and
the
heating
and
so
on.
it
is
just
impossible
to
administer.
ms.
sharon
l.
king
the
1969
ruling
never
mentions
wages.
it
does
not
talk
in
those
terms.
it
is
purely
an
administrative
convenience
type
ruling.
ms.
sharon
l.
king
and
it
does
--
ms.
sharon
l.
king
it
does
talk
about
the
obligation
to
withhold
--
ms.
sharon
l.
king
on
proper
reimbursements
and
that
they
do
not
talk
about
wages,
but
they
just
say
--
ms.
sharon
l.
king
that
is
correct.
ms.
sharon
l.
king
yes.
ms.
sharon
l.
king
well,
they
did
not
put
it
on
a
payment-by-payment
basis.
they
said
when
you
look
at
the
aggregate
of
the
payments
which
you
think
you
might
make
to
the
employee,
over
the
period
of
a
year,
if
you
reasonably
believe
that,
for
example,
if
you
as
an
employer
reimburse
on
the
basis
of
$0.10
per
mile
for
mileage
and
the
deduction
is
$0.15
now,
gone
to
$0.17
a
mile
then
obviously
there
would
be
some
excess
deduction
there
which
the
employee
would
deduct
against
other
items,
but
it
puts
an
enormous
administrative
burden
on
employers
--
ms.
sharon
l.
king
'63
is
the
year
before
the
court.
ms.
sharon
l.
king
yeah.
ms.
sharon
l.
king
well,
we
are
addressing
our
argument
to
'63.
ms.
sharon
l.
king
i
have
nothing
further.
