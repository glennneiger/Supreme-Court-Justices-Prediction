mr.
smith,
in
the
days
like
--
have
you
not
heard,
secretaries
who
want
to
know
before
i
worked,
do
i
have
electric
typewriter,
air
conditioning,
heat
et
cetera?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
they
not
all
say
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
it
is
just
a
part
of
being
sovereign.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
we
do
not
put
it
on
grounds
that
you
can
calculate.
i
think
you
have
to
find
another
ground?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
not
the
overnight
,
included
here
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
benefit
of
my
brother
stevens,
is
there
any
place
in
his
record,
or
list
of
the
places
in
chicago,
that
you
get
lunch
for
a
dollar
and
40
cents?
