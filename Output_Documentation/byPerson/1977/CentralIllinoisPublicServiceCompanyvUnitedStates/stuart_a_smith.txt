mr.
stuart
a.
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
i
would
like
to
begin
by
referring
the
court
to
the
pertinent
statutory
provision
in
this
case
which
is
set
forth
at
page
1
(a)
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
that
is
the
statutory
definition
of
wages
in
section
3401
(a)
of
the
code.
it
says
that
the
term
wages
means
all
remuneration
for
services
performed
by
an
employee
for
his
employer,
including
the
cash
value
or
remuneration
paid
in
any
medium
other
than
cash.
now,
this
broad
statutory
definition
of
wages,
talking
about
all
remuneration
is
in
our
view
consistent
with
the
congressional
design,
in
setting
up
the
withholding
tax
system
in
1943
to
correct
income
taxes
at
their
source
and
thereby
prevent
what
had
there
to
for
being
the
losses
of
large
amounts
of
revenue
for
the
--
to
the
internal
revenue
service
and
the
inconvenience
of
tax
payers
having
to
come
up
with
a
large
lump
sum
payment
at
what
was
then
march
15,
and
which
is
now
april
15,
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
return.
the
regulations
which
we
set
forth
at
page
3
(a)
of
the
appendix,
similarly
reflect
this
broad
congressional
design,
because
they
provide
respectively
that
the
name
that
you
call
remuneration
is
immaterial
that
is
salaries,
fees,
bonuses,
commissions
and
like
and
it
also
says
that
the
basis
on
which
the
remuneration
is
paid,
that
is
it
could
be
paid
on
the
basis
that
a
piece
where
percentage
of
profits
etcetera,
all
of
that
is
irrelevant.
the
question
is,
is
this
remuneration
for
services
by
an
employee
for
his
employer,
now
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
has
suggested
that
what
we
have
done
is
to
mix
up
the
things
because
this
is
not
an
income
tax
case.
it
is
a
withholding
tax
case,
but
necessarily
the
code
has
to
be
read
as
an
integrated
haul
and
we
do
not
suggest
that
all
items
of
income
or
wages.
we
are
not
suggesting
that
the
gamut
of
receipts
set
forth
in
section
61
which
is
set
forth
at
page
1
(a)
of
the
appendix
of
15
items
which
is
not
an
exhaustive
list
is
wages,
but
we
do
suggest
that
the
appropriate
focus
of
this
case
is
on
section
61
(a)
(1)
of
that
definition,
which
provides
that
gross
income
includes
compensation
for
services
including
fees,
commissions
and
similar
items.
now,
there
is
no
question
that
seems
to
us
that
these
lunch
payments
here,
really
for
the
same
reasons
i
have
pointed
out
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
we
focus
on
gross
income
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
simply
because
we
think
that
the
statutes
dovetail
each
other.
in
other
words,
we
are
talking
about
compensation
or
remuneration
for
services
and
we
are
talking
about
compensation,
those
are
really
the
same
thing
and
what
they
do
in
our
view
is
to
emphasize
the
purpose
of
the
withholding
definition.
that
is
purpose
was
to
collect
taxes
on
what
is
the
employee’s
taxable
base?
in
other
words,
that
is
why
in
our
view
the
question
of
whether
these
items
are
--
the
relevance
of
the
correll
decision
and
question
whether
these
items
are
--
whether
some
of
these
items
are
deductible
and
the
fact
that
non-overnight
lunch
payments
are
not
deductible
is
important
because
what
it
demonstrates
to
us
is
that
the
if
the
withholding
tax
system
is
to
work
coherently,
it
has
to
be
a
rough
measure
of
the
employee’s
taxable
base
and
in
this
particular
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
all
wages
are
income
and
not
--
but
not
all
income
is
wages.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
but
this
is
a
particular
kind
of
income
here
that
is
compensation
for
services
and
it
seems
to
us
that
under
section
3401,
we
are
talking
about
remuneration
for
services,
you
have
to
ask
a
question,
whether
these
people
got
these
payments
for
services
and
that
really
corresponds
to
the
section
61
(a)
(1)
category
of
gross
income.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
do
not
mean
to
label
the
point,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
two
supervisions
work
in
a
harmonious
way.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
you
do
not
need
to
make
the
point,
but
i
think
the
code
is,
it
attempts
to
be
coherent
and
that
is
what
the
entire
point
that
i
wanted
to
make.
well,
in
any
event
so
we
have
here
in
order
for
the
petitioner
to
prevail
here,
he
has
to
demonstrate
that
these
payments
were
not
compensatory
remuneration
for
services,
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
facts
of
this
case
demonstrate
the
correctness
of
the
court
of
appeals’
conclusion
that
the
payments
were
compensatory
remuneration
for
services.
first
of
all,
these
are
employees,
these
people
who
work
for
the
public
utility.
they
were
required
to
perform
services,
in
exchange
for
the
services
that
they
perform,
they
become
eligible
for
certain
agreed
upon
employee
benefits,
pursuant
to
a
union
contract,
much
like
the
union
contract
in
the
kowalski
case.
if
they
worked
at
a
normal
duty
station
they
got
their
wages,
no
doubt
about
it
that
those
are
subject
to
withholding
and
the
petitioner
does
not
contend
otherwise.
if
they
went
on
non-overnight
travel,
they
got
their
wages
plus
the
$40
a
day
meal
payment.
if
they
did
not
work
for
the
day,
they
perform
no
services,
they
got
no
wages
and
they
got
no
meal
payment.
it
seems
to
us
that
there
is
inescapable
cause
of
connection
between
the
receipt
of
the
meal
allowance
with
$40
per
day
and
the
performance
of
services
and
in
fact,
there
really
is
no
qualitative
difference
between
the
meal
allowance
and
any
other
element
of
the
employees
compensation.
that
is,
it
is
simply
comparable
to
any
other
kind
of
economic
benefit
provided
by
an
employer,
in
order
to
better
services.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
it
does
not
necessarily
make
the
heat,
a
part
of
the
wages,
but
i
would
suggest
that
when
we
are
talking
about
items
like
that.
we
are
really
talking
about
problems
that
are
--
questions
that
are
impossible
to
value.
that
is
just
not
part
of
the
compensation
scheme
in
the
way
that
wage,
the
normal
salary
and
plus
lunch
payment
is
that
day,
anymore
than
like
or
a
pencil
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well
it
seems
that
withholding
system
has
to
be
practical
system
and
i
am
not
--
i
would
think
that
perhaps
the
value
of
heat
went
into
the
withholding
taxable
base.
i
suppose
it
might
come
out
as
deductible
employee
business
expense,
because
the
employee
has
to
have
heat
to
perform
his
functions
properly
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yeah,
yeah.
the
employer.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
do
not
know
sir.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
of
course
and
there
was
--
there
was
a
problem.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
would
not
think
so.
it
seems
to
me
part
of
the
gamut
of
fringe-benefits
that
an
employer
provides
to
its
employee
in
order
with
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
suspect.
well,
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
suspect
to
say
that
as
a
technical
matter
they
do
fall
within
this
sense,
but
i
am
not
standing
on
that
sense.
i
think
what
we
are
talking
about
in
this
case
is
a
$40
a
day
cash
payment
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
is
why
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
okay.
it
seems
to
me
that
what
--
well,
i
think
that
sentence
in
the
brief
was
addressed
to
refute
the
point
made
by
the
royster
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit
in
which
petitioner
has
advanced
here
that
somehow
when
you
have
a
payment
that
is
not
tied
to
a
particular
service
that
it
is
not
compensation
for
services,
that
is
not
remuneration
for
services.
but
what
the
fourth
circuit
in
royster
said,
on
comparable
facts
is
when
the
salesman
ate
lunch
they
were
not
working
but
that
can
possibly
make
any
sense
because
vacation
pay
--
people
--
usually
during
vacation
pay
they
are
not
working
and
that
is
plainly
wages,
subject
to
withholding
and
i
do
not
think
the
petitioner
would
content
to
the
contrary
and
the
court
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
suppose
it
is
a
theoretical
matter,
but
as
again
i
point
out
that
these
are
--
the
withholding
system
is
a
practical
system
where
you
asked
i
think
earlier
are
in
the
argument
of
about
the
christmas
turkey,
the
service
has
ruled
that
items
like
that
while
technically
income
and
quite
properly
also
fit
within
the
statutory
definition
of
wages
are
simply
eliminated
from
both
tax
basis
as
a
practical
matter,
in
order
to
ease
of
tax
administration.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
that
as
a
theoretical
matter.
there
are
all
facts
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
these
are
some
of
the
problems
that
the
treasury
is
now
considering
in
terms
of
there
have
been
studies
of
the
taxability
of
fringe-benefits
and
one
of
the
things
that
the
treasury
has
to
strike
a
balance
between
its
sensible
tax
administration
which
i
would
suggest,
i
can
not
predict
how
the
study
will
come
out,
but
i
would
suggest
it
would
exclude
cups
of
coffee
on
coffee
break,
consumed
by
employees,
but
at
the
same
time
include
an
income,
more
substantial
items
which
are
more
easily
susceptible
to
evaluation
and
which
are
more
regularly
provided
across
the
board
on
an
industry-wide
basis.
here
you
have
a
large
public
utility
which
simply
decides
that
if
a
person
is
going
to
leave
his
normal
duty
station
for
the
day,he
is
going
to
get
$40
to
each
lunch
and
if
he
did
not
get
that
$40,
presumably
he
would
have
to
pay
for
the
lunch
himself
and
that
factor
from
the
judges’
point
of
view
is
a
valuable
economic
benefit.
so
as
heat,
i
suppose,
one
has
to
allocate
one’s
resources
in
deciding
what
one
is
going
to
subject
to
tax,
and
withholding,
and
when
is
it?
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
because
it
will
in
our
--
that
your
hypothetical,
would
they
were
going
back
and
forth
and
not
going
overnight.
the
way
we
read
that
regulation
the
only
way
to
have
and
what
the
petitioners
try
to
do
is
to
turn
this
--
what
we
regard
as
a
lunch
case
into
a
travel
case.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
what
you
have
to
travel
facts,
if
i
had
the
travel
fact
that
you
stated
and
there
was
no
overnight
travel,
those
amounts
of
reimbursements
would
be
remuneration
for
services,
be
part
of
total
package
of
compensation
and
there
would
not
be
any
--
there
would
not
be
any
offset
under
the
regulation
because
there
would
be
no
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
mileage
to
be
sure
because
commuting
expenses
when
you
go
--
when
one
goes
from
home
to
the
office
and
goes
back
at
night,
that
under
the
court’s
decision,
i
think
in
commissioner
v.
flowers
has
long
been
held
to
be
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
suppose
it
would
be
different
if
you
sent
him
down
to
fredericksburg
on
a
mission
of
--
for
his
employer
those
travel
expenses
would
be
a
deductible,
if
he
got
reimbursed
where
they
would
go
in
and
out
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
not
to
meal
he
ate
in
fredericksburg
because
that
comes
under
the
commissioner’s
overnight
rule
and
you
do
not
--in
other
words,
you
know
that
were
you
have
to
eat
your
lunch,
anyway
the
theory
of
the
overnight
rule
and
it
is
a
line
drawing
which
the
court
approved
back
in
1969.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
that
is
right
mr.
justice
marshall,
if
you
travel
in
non-overnight
capacity,
you
do
not
get
to
deduct
the
cost
of
your
meals
consumed.
that
was
the
what
the
court
considered
in
correll.
in
other
words,
what
is
if
a
lawyer
leaves
his
office
in
new
york
comes
down
to
washington
for
the
day,
spends
the
day
debating
with
the
irs
about
a
technical
tax
matter
and
eats
lunch,
that
lunch
is
not
a
deductible
business.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
have
two
answers
to
that.
to
begin
with
this
case
came
from
southern
district
of
illinois,
where
i
hope
that
costs
are
cheaper,
i
think
that
the
district
court
sat
in
peoria
that
decided
this
case
was
springfield.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
and
secondly
this
was
1970.
i
know
that
that
does
not
seem
that
long
but
it
was
seven
years
ago
and
i
suspect
seven
years
ago,
one
could
get
a
modest
law
and
in
fact
the
trial
transcripts
talks
about.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
but
it
is
--
it
is
threaded
in
the
midsts
of
time.
in
any
event,
we
think
that
these
were
payments
to
enlist
better
services,
there
were
payments
to
defray
a
personal
expense,
they
do
not
come
under
the
regulation
that
the
tax
payer
relies
upon,
because
they
are
non-overnight
travel
and
they
are
--
they
do
fit
properly
within
the
statutory
definition
of
wages,
now
to
the
extent
that
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
it
does
not
say
non-overnight
travel
mr.
justice
white,
but
the
regulation
i
think
was
issued
in
1943,
shortly
after
congress
enacted
the
withholding
provision.
the
commissioner
announced
his
overnight
rule
in
1940
and
this
sort
of
brings
up
the
question
of
notice
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
correll
involved
deductions.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly,
the
court
in
correll
said
that
the
commission
had
consistently
adhered
to
this
position
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
since
1940.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
antedated
these
regulations
by
a
few
years.
these
withhold
tax
regulations.
the
commissioner
is
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
think
the
withholding
tax
provisions
came
in
the
1943
in
the
war,
and
the
commissioner’s
overnight
rule
antedated
those
and
that
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
think
that
is
--
it
seems
to
me
that
is
the
purport
of
the
phrase
ordinary
and
necessary
expenses
because
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
there
were
no
expressed
rulings,
but
the
point
is
that
the
commission
that
have
to
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
the
point
--
point
is
that
the
commissioner
had
been
told
--
had
announced
the
overnight
rule
was
37
years
old.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
for
employee
deduction
purpose,
but
that
brings
up
the
point
that
i
started
with
and
that
is
that
the
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
suppose
he
could
have,
but
that
brings
up
the
point
i
mentioned
earlier.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
i
do
think
--
i
do
not
think
that
you
can
--
i
would
draw
exactly
the
contrary
inference
that
since
the
overnight
rule
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
well,
since
the
overnight
rule
involves
section
160,
a
sentence
on
section
162,
using
the
phrase
ordinary
and
necessary,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
commissioner
incorporated
his
position
in
these
regulations
and
in
fact,
since
these
things
are
not
deductible,
they
do
not
fall
out
of
the
employee’s
tax
base
and
they
are
all
necessarily
included
in
the
definition
of
wages
and
subject
to
withholding.
i
do
not
think
that
the
tax
payer
can
argue
here
that
they
were
not
on
notice
that
the
commissioner
was
taking
his
position.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
do
not
think,
the
1969
ruling
said
that
if
your
reimbursements
did
not
exceed
your
deductible
expenses,
then
you
had
to
withhold
them,
or
conversely
if
they
did
not.
that
is
what
the
1969
ruling
said,
but
what
i
want
to
say
in
terms
of
the
tax
payers’
notice
position
they
have
been
arguing
all
along
here,
that
somehow
there
is
a
universe
of
the
wages
and
then
there
is
a
universe
of
income
and
that
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
each
other
and
that
somehow
this
stuff
while
it
may
be
--
these
payments
whether
may
be
income
are
not
wages,
but
when
they
come
to
the
notice
provision,
they
shift
ground
and
talk
about
the
fact
that
they
relied
on
the
hanson
case.
the
hanson
case
is
an
income
tax
case.
it
was
one
of
the
pre-correll
court
of
appeals’
decisions
of
i
think
of
the
eighth
circuit,
which
have
rejected
the
commissioner’s
overnight
rule,
so
they
should
--
basically
they
are
coming
back
to
the
very
position
that
we
are
taking
on
the
merits
and
that
is
that
the
withholding
tax,
that
the
employee’s
tax
base
is
very
important
for
determining
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
that
was
in
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
there
was
an
old
case
holding
that
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
it
was
deductible.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
right.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
i
was
simply
making
a
point
of
about
that
they
--
my
point
was
simply
that
the
positions
were
inconsistent.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it
is
includable
and
i
think
of
yeah
what
i
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
absolutely
i
understand.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
understand.
well,
point
to
the
matter
is
that
the
old
case
or
not,
i
do
not
think
that
the
tax
payer
--
the
commissioner
had
taken
this
position
since
1940
and
the
fact
that
the
courts
were
in
disarray
on
this
question
of
the
deductibility
of
employee
business
expenses,
i
do
not
think
that
--
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
reasonable
to
rely
in
a
single
court
decision.
i
think
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
but
it
seems
to
me
when
we
are
talking
about
an
announced
position
of
non
deductibility
on
the
overnight
and
you
have
these
non-overnight
payments
and
you
have
these
statutory
definition
of
wages
and
these
items
are
plainly
compensation
or
remuneration
for
services
within
section
3401
(a),
which
seem
to
me
that
a
prudent
employer
and
a
large
employer
are
like
a
large
public
utility.
it
had
--
if
they
had
any
question
about
whether
or,
whether
or
not
to
withhold
the
prudent
thing
to
do
is
to
ask
the
internal
revenue
service.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
am
not
aware
of
any
--
i
can
not
answer
that
question
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
and
i
am
not
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
only
litigation
instituted
by
the
commissioner,
prior
to
this
case,
was
on
the
withholding
point,
it
was
the
royster
case
in
the
fourth
circuit,
so
to
that
extent,
i
cannot
tell
you
when
the
royster
case
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
went
the
other
way.
but
it
seems
to
me
--
but
it
also
--
it
also
signaled
for
the
tax
part
but
the
commissioner
was
taking
the
position
that
these
items
were
subject
to
withholding
and
we
would
submit
that
the
announcement
of
the
commissioner’s
overnight
rule
have
indicated
that
these
matters
would
--
did
not
come
out
of
the
tax
base
and
that
they
were
subject
to
withholding.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
in
1973,
although,
that
is
the
date
of
the
court
of
appeals’
decision,
i
assume
that
the
royster
case
began
quite
a
good
deal
earlier
than
1973.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions
i
--.
