mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arouse
as
a
result
of
a
dispute
that
developed
memphis,
tennessee
between
mr.
and
mrs.
willie.
s
craft
and
the
memphis
light,
gas
&
water
division.
without
going
into
the
details
of
that
dispute,
i
think
its
fair
to
say
that
the
dispute
existed
over
a
period
of
several
months
prior
to
the
filing
of
this
suit,
during
which
time
the
crafts'
utility
services
were
terminated
on
several
occasions
and
also
during
which
time
the
crafts
made
good
faith
effort
as
the
district
court
found
to
resolve
their
dispute
with
memphis
light,
gas
&
water
division.
the
dispute
that
developed,
occurred
because
of
double
computer
billing
that
was
being
sent
to
the
crafts'
residence.
and
during
this
period,
mrs.
craft
made
several
efforts
even
to
the
point
of
going
to
the
offices
of
memphis
light,
gas
&
water
division
and
spending
the
entire
day
in
an
effort
to
ascertain
the
reasons
for
the
terminations
and
to
try
to
straighten
up
the
problem.
there
is
one
important
fact
that
should
be
noted
in
this
that
is
important
to
a
proper
resolution
of
this
case
and
that
is
that
memphis
light,
gas
&
water
division
then
as
now
has
no
orderly
dispute
resolution
process
and
that
is
why
mrs.
craft
was
unable
to
resolve
her
dispute
with
the
memphis
light,
gas
&
water
division.
mr.
graves
has
indicated
that
memphis
light,
gas
&
water
division
did
not
harshly
treat
the
crafts,
the
record
is
quite
contrary
in
this
case.
on
one
occasion
when
mrs.
craft
called
to
explain
that
her
bill
had
been
paid
she
was
met
with
a
response,
pay
it
again
and
on
another
occasion
when
she
was
talking
with
someone
at
the
memphis
light,
gas
&
water
division
concerning
her
bill,
she
was
actually
cursed
by
one
of
the
employees,
but
the
important
point
is
that
no
dispute
resolution
process
exists
within
memphis
light,
gas
&
water
division.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
we
have
what
is
called
a
general
sessionâ€™s
court
your
honor,
but
it
is
not
a
small
claims
court
in
the
sense
that
no
lawyers
are
allowed
to
appear
such
as
we
have
in
some
states.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
i
think
a
notice
of
that
sort
is
the
type
that
we
are
asking.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
it
is
hard
to
say
yes
to
a
specific
notice
without
seeing
it
in
print
and
going
over
it
--
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
well,
your
question
was
directed
to
the
notice,
but
as
i
think
what
we
are
asking
for
is
the
type
of
notice
that
you
just
mentioned
to
give
the
person
opportunity
for
some
type
of
hearing
that
that
would
only
have
to
be
at
the
first
stage,
an
informal
conference
with
a
responsible
official
at
memphis
light,
gas
&
water
division
and
then
if
it
is
not
resolved
at
that
stage,
i
think
there
should
be
an
informal
hearing
before
an
impartial
hearing.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
well,
i
think
in
numerous
cases
it
is
decided
by
this
court
such
as
goldberg
v.
kelly,
i
think
before
the
termination
of
welfare
service
in
that
case.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
that
was
an
informal
hearing
before
an
independent
hearing
examiner
prior
to
the
termination.
let
me
make
clear
that
when
i
say
--
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
that
is
correct
and
i
want
to
point
out
we
are
not
necessarily
asking
for
someone
outside
the
company
so
long,
even
if
it
is
an
employee
of
the
company,
so
long
as
that
person
has
the
independence
to
look
at
the
case
fairly
and
to
make
a
decision
in
favor
of
the
consumer,
we
feel
that
would
be
adequate.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
i
suppose
it
does,
but
the
record
in
this
case
indicates
that
they
also
have
some
problems
in
resolving
disputes
that
developed
between
customers
and
one
of
the
problems
that
mrs.
craft
had
was
that
the
persons
that
she
was
communicating
were
lower
level
employees
who
really
did
not
have
the
authority
to
resolve
any
dispute
that
might
have
developed.
we
are
saying
that
the
situation
would
probably
be
improved
if
a
responsible
company
official,
in
other
words,
a
higher
level
employee
--
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
i
think
it
is
because
it
is
a
state
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
that
is
correct
under
the
jackson
--
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
i
am
not
sure.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
well,
the
--
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
well,
they
are
employees
of
the
city,
at
least
in
so
far
as
they
are
officials
of
the
memphis
light,
gas
&
water
division,
they
are
state
officers,
yes.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
yes.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
no,
i
do
not
think
their
analysis
is
as
full
as
it
should
be.
i
think
at
the
time
this
case
was
decided
they
were
just
relying
primarily
on
other
cases.
i
think
as
this
court
has
pointed
out,
there
must
be
reference
to
whether
this
property
interest
exists
under
state
law,
but
i
think
it
is
clear
that
under
the
state
law
of
tennessee
a
person
has
a
right
to
receive
utility
service
and
the
utility
supplier
has
a
duty
to
supply.
so
i
think
analysis
of,
a
proper
analysis
under
roth
and
sindermann
and
more
recent
decisions
of
this
court
that
there
clearly
is
a
property
interest
under
state
law.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
that
is
correct.
we
do
not
assert
that
the
customers
have
the
right
to
free
utility
service.
there
is
no
question
of
what
utility
service
may
be
terminated
for
non-payment
in
tennessee.
it
is
just
that
we
question
the
right
of
the
utility
service
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
terminate
utility
service
while
a
dispute
is
pending.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
a
responsible
company
official,
i
think
that
would
be
adequate.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
well,
i
think
there
was
a
distinction
made
in
the
palmer
case
of
the
sixth
circuit
in
that
an
official
or
an
officer
of
the
company
would
have
more
freedom
to
rule
in
favor
of
the
customer
than
a
lower
level
employee.
in
other
words
--
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
well,
no
i
do
not
think
that
would
be
okay
because
the
problem
as
the
record
in
this
case
indicates
is
that
the
employees
in
the
credit
department
our
concerned
primarily
with
getting
people
to
pay
their
bills.
they
are
not
concerned
with
resolving
disputes.
the
record
in
this
case
indicates
that
they
do
not
even
have
the
time
to
do
that
because
there
so
many
calls
that
they
get
each
day,
there
is
no
way
possible
that
they
can
deal
with
disputes
concerning
bills.
the
only
thing
they
can
deal
with
is
people
who
are
having
difficulty
paying
an
admitted
liability.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
well,
i
think
the
holdings
of
this
court
indicate
that
the
question
of
notice
and
hearing
is
always
are
variable
according
to
the
circumstances
of
a
particular
case
and
i
cannot
cite
any
specific
holding
that
would
require
that,
but
i
think
that
under
recent
decisions
of
this
court,
the
type
of
notice
that
has
been
required
in
certain
cases
such
as
morrissey
v.
brewer
was
a
very
specific
notice
and
it
informed
the
person
of
more
than
just
the
action
that
was
about
to
be
taken.
it
also
informed
the
person
of
the
steps
that
they
might
take
to
prevent
the
threat
and
harm.
the
problem
in
this
case
is
that
mrs.
craft
attempted
to
take
some
steps
to
prevent
threat
and
harm.
she
acted
as
any
reasonable
person
would
and
went
to
the
offices
of
memphis
light,
gas
&
water
division,
but
was
unable
to
resolve
the
dispute
because
she
was
never
informed
either
there
or
in
the
notice
of
what
she
--
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
well,
i
am
not
even
sure
that
it
would
have
been
straightened
out
in
a
hurry
because
there
was
no
dispute
whether
--
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
that
is
possible,
but
my
only
point
is
there
is
no
dispute
resolution
process
within
memphis
light,
gas
&
water.
so
they
may
not
--
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
the
only
indication
in
the
record
as
far
as
numbers
is
that
during
the
year
1973,
i
believe
when
this
case
was
being
litigated
there
were
something
like
33000
hard
deal
complaints.
now,
as
to
whether
that
can
be
classified
as
a
dispute,
i
do
not
know,
but
i
think
that
it
probably
would
be.
this
is
certainly
different
from
some
of
the
cases
in
this
area
such
as
the
one
that,
your
honor
decided
in
the
seventh
circuit
where
the
record
indicated
that
there
were
only
a
small
number
of
disputes
that
developed
over
a
certain
time
period
and
also
i
believe
in
the
lucas
case
which
your
honor
decided,
there
was
a
process
within
the
company
for
resolving
disputes
and
most
of
them
were
in
fact
resolved
prior
termination
that
is
required.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
that
is
correct.
another
important
factor
there
is
that
the
public
service
commission
in
that
case,
since
it
was
a
privately
owned
utility,
had
the
authority
and
did
in
fact
intervene
on
many
occasions
and
halted
the
termination
service
while
the
dispute
was
being
resolved.
in
this
case
the
public
service
commission
has
no
jurisdiction
over
memphis
light,
gas
&
water
division
and
there
is
nobody
that
can
intervene
like
that
and
halt
the
termination
while
the
dispute
is
being
resolved.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
no
i
do
not
think
so
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
i
think
all
we
are
asking
the
court
do
to
is
to
set
up
and
order
memphis
light,
gas
&
water
division
to
setup
a
dispute
resolution
process.
it
would
not
mean
that
every
kind
of
a
person
had
a
dispute
concerning
their
utility
service,
if
they
could
run
into
the
federal
court
for
resolution.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
well,
i
think
if
they
--
there
would
be
no
right
of
action
in
federal
court
to
resolve
the
dispute,
the
claim
here
is
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
violated
because
due
process
is
not
being
provided.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
well,
i
think
we
are
asking
--
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
i
suppose
not
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
well,
i
think
what
would
help
is
as
we
have
discussed
previously,
to
have
a
hearing
examiner
who
has
the
responsibility
to
hear
disputes,
that
develop
between
consumers
and
memphis
light,
gas
&
water
division
who
has
the
authority
to
render
a
decision
--
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
and
to
enforce
that
decision.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
well
i
would
--
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
the
commissioners
of
the
utility
--
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
mi
do
not
think
he
would
necessarily
be
over
them.
i
really
do
not
see
a
problem
developing
that
your
honor
has
anticipated.
i
assume
enough
good
faith
on
the
part
of
memphis
light,
gas
&
water
division,
that
if
they
have
a
hearing
examiner,
and
he
hears
the
case
and
orders
that
the
utilities
be
turned
back
on,
that
he
would
be
a
high
enough
company
official
that
he
could
order
lower
level
employees
to
the
turn
the
utility
services
back
on.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
well,
if
there
is
any
confusion
there,
i
was
using
the
terms
interchangeably,
that
the
person
who
is
hearing
the
case
could
be
a
responsible
company
official.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
no,
i
think
if
we
look
at
what
the
sixth
circuit
did
for
example
in
the
palmer
case
is
an
indication
of
what
i
am
talking
about.
there,
they
required
that
a
responsible
company
official
within
the
utility
supplier
be
able
to
hear
the
dispute
in
an
informal
manner
and
make
the
decision
as
to
whether
service
should
be
terminated
or
not
so
that
while
the
person
hearing
the
dispute
was
an
employee
of
the
official,
they
nevertheless
conducted
an
informal
type
dispute
resolution
process,
but
they
would
not
necessarily
have
to
be
completely
disassociated
from
the
utility
supplier.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
i
think
the
fourteenth
amendment
requires
some
type
of
opportunity
fohearing
prior
to
the
termination
of
service.
i
do
not
think
that
the
common
law
remedy
of
suing
for
damages
in
state
court
would
be
adequate.
now,
this
court
recently
in
ingraham
v.
wright
held
that
a
common
a
lawsuit
for
damages
was
adequate
in
the
context
of
the
corporal
punishment.
i
think
that
case
is
quite
different
from
here.
first
of
all,
the
governmental
interest
involved
there
in
school
disciplinary
--
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
that
the
problem
with
the
full
court
hearing
in
that
situation
is
the
burden
of
proof
is
switched
to
the
customer
to
show
that
he
is
right
and
the
utility
service
is
wrong.
that
is
the
reverse
of
the
normal
common
law
procedure
that
want
us
starting
something
do
you
have
the
burden
of
proving
that
it
is
due.
it
puts
the
burden
on
the
customer
to
hire
a
lawyer,
pay
the
litigation
expenses
required
to
--
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
i
think
that
that
might
be
sufficient
as
an
initial
process,
but
as
the
sixth
circuit
required
in
the
palmer
case
what
we
are
asking
is
that
if
he
makes
that
decision
there
still
should
be
some
tort
type
of
informal
hearing
where
a
written
decision
is
rendered.
now
--
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
not
necessarily
before
the
cut
off.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
i
think
before
the
cut
off
that
might
be
sufficient
under
the
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
i
think
it
would
be
sufficient
before
the
cut
off
as
long
as
at
least
act
for
the
cut
off,
there
would
be
a
more
formalized
hearing
or
the
administrator
--
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
i
suppose
it
is
conceivable
that
a
person
could
abuse
the
process
in
that
way,
but
i
do
not
think
the
fact
that
there
might
somewhere
be
a
customer
who
would
abuse
the
process
would
mean
that
we
should
not
--
that
we
should
have
banned
on
the
requirements
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
that
is
correct
but
i
suppose
it
is
possible,
but
--
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
it
does
and
i
do
not
think
that
most
people
would
abuse
the
process
in
that
way
because
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
real
disputes
that
people
have
concerning
their
utility
service.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
that
is
correct,
you
would
not.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
well,
the
hearing
such
as
in
the
craft
case
would
be
about
why
are
the
crafts
were
getting
two
bills
every
month
rather
than
one
that
most
customers
get
and
whether
that
bill
was
correct
or
not.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
well,
except
for
the
fact
that
your
honor
--
even
though
they
were
aware
that
they
had
two
meters,
there
were,
they
thought
and
were
in
fact
told
by
a
memphis
light,
gas
&
water
division
employee
that
one
of
the
meters
were
belted
off
and
so
they
thought
that
service
was
only
coming
through
one
meter
and
i
think
as
the
district
court
found
mr.
and
mrs.
craft
were
making
effort
to
find
out
what
the
problem
was
and
were
ready
and
willing
to
pay
the
bill
that
was
due.
it
is
just
that
they
could
not
understand
of
why
they
were
getting
those
two
bills
and
memphis
light,
gas
&
water
division
seem
to
unable
to
explain
it
to
them.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
well,
it
started
in
1974,
so
about
four
years.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
well,
right
the
dispute
started
in
73,
that
is
correct,
but
the
suit
was
not
actually
filed
until
74.
if
the
court
please,
what
we
are
asking
this
court
to
do
in
terms
of
requiring
due
process
here
is
as
this
court
has
done
in
numerous
cases
is
to
balance
the
private
interest
that
is
involved
here
and
the
governmentâ€™s
interest.
the
private
interest
that
is
involved
here
is
an
extremely
important
interest.
it
is
the
interest
in
the
very
means
to
life
in
some
situations.
we
are
talking
about
water
service,
gas
and
electrical
service
which
in
the
cold
winter
months
provides
the
means
for
heat
in
most
municipalities
in
this
country.
so
the
significance
of
this
interest
is
quite
important.
termination
of
this
interest
can
cause
serious
harm
to
a
customer
and
in
some
cases
has
even
caused
death
and
so
we
are
not
talking
about
a
situation
like
this
court
dealt
with
in
ingraham
v.
wright
where
we
are
talking
about
corporal
punishments
of
students.
we
are
talking
about
the
potential
for
much
more
serious
harm
to
the
plaintiffs.
we
also
had
to
balance
that
against
the
governmentâ€™s
interest
involved
here.
the
governmentâ€™s
interest
of
course
is
preserving
scarce
physical
resources,
but
there
is
no
reason
that
memphis
light,
gas
&
water
division
cannot
provide
the
type
of
notice
and
hearing
that
we
are
requesting
within
the
time
frame
that
they
presently
terminate
service
and
still
be
able
to
preserve
their
scarce
physical
resources
and
the
fact
that
a
person
gets
a
hearing
does
not
mean
that
they
are
not
going
to
have
to
pay
the
bill.
if
it
is
found
that
customer
is
incorrect,
they
will
nevertheless
have
to
pay
the
bill.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
and
the
cost
of
the
hearing,
we
would
concede
that
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
well,
if
the
court
please,
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
property
interest
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
of
course
the
source
is
--
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
as
to
where
the
memphis
light,
gas
&
water
division
is
a
person?
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
well,
i
think
that
that
issue
has
really
not
being
raised,
but
i
think
--
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
yes.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
yes
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
well,
i
think
that
we
have
certain
individual
dependence
here,
commissioners
of
memphis
light,
gas
&
water
division
who
clearly
are
persons
under
section
1983,
even
though
it
is
questionable
whether
memphis
light,
gas
&
water
division
itself
is
a
person.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
i
think
they
are
probably
not
because
in
memphis,
the
memphis
light,
gas
&
water
division
is
not
a
separate
corporation,
it
is
a
part
of
the
city.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
that
is
correct
your
honor,
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
since
the
damages
would
be
instant
--
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
i
think
that
whatever
the
damages
were
paid
out
of
city
funds,
would
not
make
any
difference,
as
to
whether
they
are
persons
under
section
1983.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
i
do
not
believe
it
would.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
because
it
is
a
city,
that
is
correct
your
honor.
i
did
want
to
raise
one
point
in
that
regard
to
mr.
justice
blackmun
raised
the
issue
of
mootness
in
this
case
and
raised
the
question
as
to
whether
there
is
a
damage
issue
still
open.
it
is
the
respondentâ€™s
position
that
there
is
a
damage
issue
still
open
in
this
case,
if
this
court
affirms
the
holding
of
the
sixth
circuit.
there
were
no
damages
ordered
at
the
district
court
level
because
the
district
court
held
that
we
had
no
due
process
right,
but
if
this
case
is
remanded
on
the
holding
that
the
plaintiffs
did
have
a
right
to
due
process
prior
to
termination
of
service,
i
think
the
issue
of
damages
would
still
be
an
open
question
and
for
that
reason
the
case
is
not
moot.
in
addition
to
that,
on
the
claims
for
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief,
i
think
that
this
case
would
come
within
that
class
of
cases
which
are
capable
of
reputation
yet
awaiting
review
as
set
out
by
previous
decisions
of
this
court
and
so
that
it
would
not
been
moot
for
that
reason.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
that
issue
we
believe
has
been
finally
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
that
issue
was
not
raised
by
the
petitioners.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
that
is
correct
your
honor,
and
the
sixth
circuit
held
that
there
was
a
denial
of
equal
protection
and
i
believe
the
petitioners
--
mr.
thomas
m.
daniel
--
have
conceded
that
point.
