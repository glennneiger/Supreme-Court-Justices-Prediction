mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
my
name
is
frierson
graves
and
i
represent
the
memphis
light,
gas
&
water
division
which
is
a
part
of
the
city
of
memphis,
a
municipal
utility
which
has
both
electric,
gas
and
water
operations.
this
action
arose
when
mr.
and
mrs.
craft
and
several
others
sued
the
memphis
light,
gas
&
water
division
alleging
that
their
utility
services
were
being
terminated
without
due
process
of
law
and
they
ask
for
both
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief.
the
district
court
implied
that
there
was
property
in
the
utility
services.
it
really
did
not
say
one
way
or
another,
but
the
implication
is
there,
but
found
that
minimum
due
process
was
present
in
the
procedure
used
by
the
light,
gas
&
water,
but
it
suggested
a
change
in
the
notice
that
we
were
given,
giving
to
our
customers
when
the
final
notice
was
sent
out
which
was
an
additional
stuff
or
a
flag.
this
change
was
made
in
the
notice,
a
final
order
entered.
it
was
an
appeal
to
the
sixth
circuit
which
found
that
utility
services
was
property.
however,
this
finding
as
to
due
process
had
two
different
holdings,
as
to
mr.
and
mrs.
parks
who
had
an
admitted
liability
for
an
amount
of
the
bill.
the
sixth
circuit
said
that
our
final
notice
with
act
applying
to
credit
counselors
and
a
hearing
before
credit
counselors
to
arrange
budget
payments
or
extended
payments
was
a
efficient
constitutional
due
process
notice
and
hearing,
but
on
the
other
hand,
the
crafts
who
allegedly
had
a
dispute
that
a
notice
and
a
hearing
was
not
sufficient
and
we
did
not
have
a
established
procedures
for
a
hearing
nor
did
i
notice
used
the
word
dispute
really
in
it
and
applying
to
the
crafts.
we
petitioned
this
court
and
the
two
questions
were
whether
or
not
utility
services
are
property
and
secondly
whether
or
not
the
procedures
used
by
the
light,
gas
&
water
meet
the
minimum
requirements
of
the
due
process
or
what
procedures
must
be
used.
i
would
like
to
say
first
that
a
utility
wants
to
keep
its
customers
on
land.
it
wants
to
generate
the
revenue
whether
it
is
a
municipal
utility
or
a
private
utility
because
we
in
memphis
operate
on
a
non-profit
basis
as
a
municipal
utility
just
to
pay
expenses
so
the
more
revenue
we
are
able
to
generate
from
the
customer,
they
end
up
better
to
spread
that
for
your
administrative
expenses
among
your
ratepayers.
secondly,
we
think
and
we
think
our
procedures
establishes
this
that
a
utility
ought
to
do
all
it
can
to
help
its
customer
pay
its
bills
and
one
of
things
that
we
did
which
is
in
the
record
of
this
court
is
to
establish
a
budget
procedure
or
a
policy
of
having
extended
payments.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
your
honor
i
think
that
goes
back
to
sort
of
the
general
common
law
rules
about
a
utility
that
you
should
not
give
free
service
because
just
as
you
must
provide
service
to
a
customer,
if
a
reasonable
service
to
him
so
that
every
person
can
have
the
service,
likewise
you
should
not
give
the
service
to
a
customer
who
is
not
paying
for
that
because
you
are
discriminating
against
your
ratepayer
in
that
way
and
of
course
they
say
that
reason
both
is
for
reasonable
room
for
free
service
plus
the
fact
that
you
are
avoiding
numerous
small
petty
suits
because
utility
services
is
merely
a
credit
transaction.
normally,
you
have
an
individual
either
in
oral
contract,
in
memphis
you
can
have
your
utilities
connected
by
calling
up
on
the
telephone
and
say
will
you
connect
the
utilities
to
my
address?
the
utilities
are
connected,
you
are
asked
to
pay
a
deposit
of
$25
in
this,
that
sometimes
place
the
point
in
your
first
bill,
in
this
you
have
a
small
credit
transaction
therefore
which,
we
extend
the
new
customer
65
days
of
service
almost
or
that
possibility
60
or
65
days
before
we
can
cut
the
personnel.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
the
court
suggested
that
the
craftâ€™s
be
allowed
a
$35
credit
and
they
were
allowed
that
credit.
so
i
do
not
consider
that
damages
are
still
in
this
case
sir.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
no
sir
because
we
still
do
not
have
what
the
petitioners
wanted.
we
established
a
notice
and
a
procedure
and
the
sixth
circuit
said
that
they
did
not
comment
on
our
new
notice,
but
our
old
notice
was
still
constitutionally
deficient,
so
that
is
their
declaratory
judgment
and
relief
that
our
notice
was
sufficient
in
this
and
of
course
we
are
contending
that
utility
service
really
is
not
property.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
no
sir
that
was
a
private
utility
that
the
court
found
was
sort
of
callous
and
we
do
not
think
that
our
policies
do
that.
they
were
also
--
it
was
conceded
that
utility
services
were
property,
in
that
case
for
a
private
utility.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
your
honor
they
cited
a
number
of
cases
which
rely
upon
several
reasons.
one
that
water
or
electricity
is
indispensable
to
life,
and
therefore,
you
should
have
it
and
they
cite
a
number
of
cases
both
district
and
other
circuits
that
tend
to
say
both
are
necessity
of
life
or
that
there
is
some
by
having
this
as
a
municipal
utility,
we
have
that
state
action
and
also
that
you
have
the
rule
that
you
should
give
utilities
to
every
customer.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
yes
sir.
we
go
back
to
1902
tennessee
case
of
jones
v.
nashville
and
that
established
more
or
less
a
franchisee
ordinance
and
that
establishes
what
i
think
was
merely
the
common
law
of
general
rule
of
utilities
that
quasi
public
type
of
corporation
that
when
you
provide
the
service
you
must
give
it
to
all
customers,
but
you
have
in
the
righteous
upon
the
utility
to
furnish
those
services
to
the
customers,
but
the
utility
may
make
reasonable
rules
and
among
those
rules
is
they
can
deny
the
service
to
a
person
if
he
does
not
comply
with
it.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
yes
sir
and
i
think
the
rule
whether
it
is
an
admitted
liability
or
dispute,
that
the
utility
can
determine
the
rules
and
regulations
and
that
the
right
of
either
of
suing
for
an
injunction,
paying
on
a
protest
and
suing
or
suing
for
damages,
that
the
rule
was
made
in
common
law
for
the
utility's
benefit
and
not
as
an
entitlement
or
an
independent
source
or
a
state
statute
to
allow
an
entitlement
to
the
customer
because
the
utility
could
terminate,
but
it
did
so
at
its
peril,
in
this
case
making
it
subject
for
damages.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
yes
sir
and
that
you
cannot
argue
that
water
is
indispensable
to
life
or
electricity
is
indispensable
to
life
because
if
that
is
so
then
a
person
with
an
admitted
liability
for
that
is
mere
using
the
services
why
should
you
ever
be
able
to
cut
them
off.
congress
this
past
year
have
appropriated
200
million
dollars
for
the
community
development
act
to
help
pay
on
utility
bills
for
this
past
winter,
but
that
is
if
they
want
energy
stamps
or
other
matters
in
which
to
pay
for
utility
services,
it
should
be
taxpayer
program
and
not
a
ratepayer
program
that
it
is
upon
the
utility
to
maintain
this.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
yes
sir
and
under
state
law
the
utility
would
have
to
adopt
reasonable
rules
because
that
is
the
normal
rule.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
they
have
got
to
send
them
the
bill,
so
they
know
what
they
have
to
pay
and
once
they
know
they
just
do.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
no
sir,
it
could
do
that,
they
would
have
to
tell
them
--
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
no
sir,
the
common
law
rule
is
that
you
must
send
any
creditor
his
bill
in
this
when
you
have
send
the
creditor
his
bill
and
you
tell
him
you
owe
$9.89
for
utilities
then
you
are
telling
him
pay
the
$9.89
or
you
will
be
terminated
by
certain
effect.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
what
his
obligation
is,
but
not
the
fact
that
he
may
dispute
what
that
obligation
is
and
have
a
continued
right
to
get
the
water
out
of
the
city
pipes
in
the
street
or
gas
out
of
the
pipes
and
continue
this
while
he
is
doing
a
dispute
because
if
they
want
to
terminate
it
on
the
basis
of
this,
they
do
not
have
to
do
the
continued
credit
transaction
and
they
cannot
say,
well,
that
is
because
it
is
a
necessity
of
life
or
say,
well,
there
is
some
independent
source
such
as
a
state
statute
do
this
because
there
was
a
state
statute
enough
in
jackson
when
they
codified
common
law
rights
to
say
what
was
--
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
i
think
that
gives
rise
to
a
damage
action
too,
i
do
not
know
what
it
is
constitutional
or
not,
but
i
think
--
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
well,
i
do
not
think
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
you
must
send
a
bill.
i
admit
that
you
must
send
the
bill.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
the
source
of
the
obligation
is
the
credit
transaction.
the
question
is
do
you
have
to
continue
selling
on
credit
while
you
are
litigating
whether
the
old,
the
past
credit
or
not.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
i
am
saying
under
the
common
law
there
is
a
right
to
receive
the
service
so
long
as
you
obey
the
rules
and
regulations.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
well,
under
common
law
regarding
your
utilities.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
of
course
sir
it
is
enforced
every
where,
just
like
jackson
v.
metropolitan.
they
had
to
furnish
services
to
anybody
that
would
pay
for
it
and
if
they
did
not
pay
for
it
then
the
question
was
could
they
cut
it
off.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
well,
you
are
making
assumption
that
they
are
not
sending
any
bill
at
all
or
not
making
any
claim?
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
or
if
they
send
then
the
bill
then
i
do
not
--
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
then
i
think
they
merely
have
a
common
law
right
to
damages
against
the
utility
and
it
is
not
the
constitutional
right.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
no
violation
of
constitutional
right
--
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
well,
i
do
not
consider
the
property
interest
for
continued
payment,
of
continued
credit
being
given.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
i
think
they
can
refuse
it
like
any
other
credit
transaction.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
it
is
not
free
to
refuse
service
except
under
its
rules
and
regulations,
if
it
has
not
been
paid
for
past
service.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
they
must
serve
them
if
it
has
the
reasonable
means
to
do
it
at
that
time
and
if
they
live
5
miles
from
town,
we
could
say
--
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
yes
sir
and
we
say
that
in
answer
again
to
justice
white
if
they
did
not
get
a
bill
to
begin
with,
then
they
receive
some
damages
and
then
they
will
have
an
adequate
remedy
of
law,
but
it
is
not
a
constitutional
right
to
continue
paying
it
on
the
basis
of
not
paying
a
bill
and
not
having
a
continued
and
time
limit
to
credit
while
they
are
litigating
for
past
credit
extended.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
no
sir.
they
have
to
charge
everyone
the
same
rate
without
discrimination.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
no
sir
it
does
not.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
our
padison
case
that
you
may
adopt
a
rule
that
you
can
terminate
for
non
payment
and
our
other
cases
say
that
you
can
still
terminate
for
non
payment
even
if
there
is
a
dispute
because
the
termination
is
at
your
peril
and
the
utility
could
be
sued
for
damages
if
they
make
that
improper
termination.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
your
honor
we
consider
the
fact
of
saying
that
we
were
not
a
person.
we
are
also
sued
by
individual
commissioners.
we
were
being
asked
for
declaratory
relief,
so
that
the
previous
counsel
did
not
choose
to
raise
that
arguments
as
to
whether
they
were
person
because
we
also
had
our
individual
commissioners
sued
who
could
be
charged
and
were
charged
under
charter
with
making
the
policy
just
as
individual
boards
of
education
or
individual
other
members
of
board
would
make
policies
--
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
yes
sir
it
is,
but
the
counsel
who
tried
this
before
me
chose
not
to
raise
the
question
--
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
your
honor
i
do
not
think
he
really
was
finding
that.
i
think
he
was
finding
that
we
were
not
violating
due
process
in
this.
he
may
have
mentioned
that,
but
he
is
still
entered
his
decree
and
said
we
should
have
a
better
notice
and
we
should
give
credit
and
our
individual
commissioners
were
also
sued
in
this
case
as
well.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
yes
sir.
we
are
under
the
charge
of
city
memphis
and
just
a
division
of
it.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
yes
sir
and
if
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
talk
a
little
bit
about
the
facts
on
our
hearing
and
notice
because
we
consider
--
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
no
sir,
i
am
not
conceding
there
is
property
because
i
do
not
consider
there
is
an
independent
source
by
state
statute
or
otherwise
that
you
said
in
board
of
regents
v.
roth
and
others
that
makes
it,
that
what
we
are
talking
about
is
the
general
law
of
utilities
which
would
apply
to
a
private
or
municipality
which
says
that
you
can
make
reasonable
rules
which
include
at
your
peril
terminating
someone
for
what
you
consider
not
--
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
that
is
right.
on
that
basis
sir,
i
would
--
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
no
sir.
because
we
have
made
an
error
in
taking
that
service,
he
has
the
same
common
law
actions
to
go
in
and
ask
for
an
injunction
to
go
in
and
say
do
you
(voice
overlap)
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
if
he
has
paid
his
bill.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
your
honor,
the
fact
of
whether
or
not
utility
makes
a
mistake
--
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
under
the
law
of
utility
he
has
the
right
to
service
whether
that
makes
it
a
--
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
that
is
submitted.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
because
i
do
not
think
it
reaches
that
independent
source
that
the
court
has
said
you
must
make
it
fourteenth
amendment,
that
is
by
state
law
rule
or
understanding
that
you
have
done
and
now
if
you
say
that
is
so
then
you
have
made
it,
but
when
you
look
at
the
education
case
of
goss
v.
lopez
and
say
because
the
state
chose
to
provide
the
service
and
pass
the
statute
that
made
and
also
a
statute
you
must
attend
school,
that
made
it
federally
protective,
but
we
do
not
have
that
statute
or
that
independent
source.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
no
sir,
it
is
not
a
state
law.
it
is
just
the
regular
law
of
utilities.
it
is
just
the
common
law.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
yes
sir
and
every
state.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
i
am
from
the
standpoint
that
they
are
declaring
it
is
the
common
law
for
utilities
throughout
every
state,
your
honor
and
they
are
following
the
general
rule,
now,
if
that
makes
it
a
constitutional
protected
property
right
that
may
be,
but
i
did
not
think
it
met
the
test
of
roth.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
yes
sir.
you
had
a
state
statute
that
provided
for
free
education
and
the
state
statute
for
compulsory
attendance
and
when
they
suspended
somebody,
they
should
be
given
a
hearing.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
well,
roth
was
the
tenure,
yes
sir.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
i
think
they
send
it
back
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
was
defecto
types
rights.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
well,
our
rules
and
regulations
also
provide
that
if
you
pay
your
bills,
you
get
the
service,
but
if
you
do
not
pay
your
bills,
you
do
not
get
the
service,
so
that
is
the
distinction
between
them.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
yes
sir
and
they
are
in
the
public
service
commission.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
your
honor,
if
they
were
under
state
action,
but
some
of
the
district
court
cases
say
because
of
those
state
statutes
that
makes
it
a
property
right.
on
the
other
hand
i
say
that
is
no
different
than
just
the
codification
of
the
common
law
and
does
that
make
it
a
property
law.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
no
sir,
we
are
still
subject
to
damages
and
liability
for
failure
to
abide
by
own
rules
and
regulations.
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
say
something
about
our
notice
in
this
case.
we
sent
out
notices
that
not
only
had
a
final
notice,
but
it
also
had
a
flier
in
it
that
said
if
you
had
any
dispute
in
some
cases,
in
some
cases
it
did
not
say
the
word
dispute,
but
it
says
if
you
are
having
difficulty
paying
your
bill
come
to
the
credit
counselors.
we
think
that
the
record
clearly
shows
that
we
were
giving
adequate
notice
and
a
hearing
for
this
reason.
when
somebody
gets
a
utility
bill,
they
say
i
did
not
use
that
much
service,
you
made
a
mistake,
i
have
got
too
high
a
bill.
when
you
talk
to
light,
gas
&
water,
we
re-read
33,000
meters
during
1973,
so
we
were
cognizant
of
any
complaint
and
did
something
about
it
of
any
high
bill.
if
you
had
difficulty
paying
your
bill
or
you
had
something
to
matter
with
it,
62000
people
came
into
the
credit
office
during
that
year
and
were
handled
by
the
credit
officials.
when
the
crafts
had
their
problems
because
they
bought
a
duplex
and
the
real
estate
agent
said
do
not
pay
any
attention
to
the
fact
that
you
have
got
two
meters
here
then
the
crafts
had
a
help,
even
though
they
had
25
days
from
the
time
they
got
their
bill
until
they
got
final
notice
to
they
got
cut
off.
they
went
to
the
utility.
they
got
their
meter
put
back
in.
they
got
their
utilities
on
and
they
lasted
from
june
until
september.
when
a
meter
reader
went
by
and
they
said
our
checks
in
the
mail
and
they
did
not
cut
off.
when
they
were
cut
off
in
october,
they
went
to
the
utility
and
somebody
must
have
told
them
at
the
utility
that
you
have
got
two
meters,
you
got
to
have
them
combined
if
you
do
not
want
a
duplex
with
two
meters.
they
did
it,
they
did
not
pay
their
bill
again,
when
they
were
cut
off
in
november,
even
though
they
were
getting
two
bills
for
not
double
billing,
split
billing,
each
meter
registering
the
service.
when
they
came
back
in
november,
their
utilities
were
cut
back
on
and
they
were
put
on
budget
billing
and
they
paid
$25
or
so
and
$100
were
delayed.
when
in
december
they
were
to
be
cut
off
again,
december
28th
they
called
up
and
got
an
extension
till
january
8th.
in
this
time,
the
meters
were
finally
combined
because
the
electricians
and
the
plumber
had
made
a
mistake
in
combining
which
ones
that
were
there
so
then
you
cannot
say
that
we
were
callous
towards
the
crafts
or
anybody
and
that
we
consider
that
when
we
were
giving
that
information
and
handling
the
people
and
adopting
the
budget
procedure
and
that
when
you
have
a
dispute
regardless
of
whether
its
an
amount
of
a
bill
or
whether
you
owe
that
much,
or
whether
you
owe
it
at
all,
if
you
go
to
massey's,
you
go
to
the
credit
department
to
any
big
place.
when
you
go
to
the
utility
those
notices
which
were
not
in
the
opinion
or
any
appendix
say
mlgw
credit
department
at
the
bottom
so
that
is
--
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
that
is
right
sir.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
that
is
right,
but
when
we
give
you
notice
of
who
to
come
to
and
we
say
mlgw
credit
department
or
credit
counselors
or
if
you
have
any
difficulty
paying
your
bill,
i
think
common
sense
tells
you
that
you
go
the
credit
department,
that
is
the
people
that
signed
the
bill
and
that
the
record
shows
that
we
handled
over
a
100,000
people
through
either
credit
department
or
calling
up
to
get
extensions
or
re-reading
their
meters
and
we
did
it.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
i
have
one
sentence.
i
agree
with
justice
marshall
that
everyone
complaints
about
the
amount
of
utility,
they
all,
so
that
the
question
of
whether
it
is
a
dispute
or
not
and
we
say
by
our
notice
to
come
to
the
credit
department
that
we
have
established
a
hearing
procedure
because
the
evidence
was
that
our
hearing,
our
credit
counselors
usually
have
15
to
20
years
of
service
and
are
competent
people
and
so
they
would
be
ones
and
you
need
10
or
12
or
15
people
because
we
had
235,000
electric
customers
and
we
feel
that
establishing
that
initial
contact
and
the
crafts
waited
until
their
utilities,
had
the
notice
and
had
been
terminated
and
then
they
came
and
they
got
the
ultimate
advice
by
telling
them,
combine
your
meters,
put
you
on
a
budget
payment
and
it
would
not
be
double
billing,
but
split
billing
because
they
got
the
service
to
reclaim.
mr.
frierson
m.
graves,
jr.
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
they
can
--
that
everybody
gets
the
answer
they
right
about
utility
bills
in
this
because
i
think
a
utility
could
not
compromise
and
give
away
the
utilities
just
on
the
basis
of
selling
it,
that
they
would
have
to
attempt
the
charge
what
was
reasonably
said
by
the
meter
to
the
purpose.
