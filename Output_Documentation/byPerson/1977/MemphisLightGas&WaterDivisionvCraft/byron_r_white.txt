justice
byron
r.
white
right,
i
take
it
then
you
say
if
the
utility
sense
of
personal
analysis
says
you
are
cut
off
and
the
person
wants
to
know
why
and
the
utility
says
it
is
none
of
your
business
and
then
the
person
sues
the
utility
and
wins
and
utility
freely
admits
that,
well,
we
just
cut
you
off
for
no
reason
at
all,
you
would
agree
that
under
the
state
law
the
utility
would
be
liable?r
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that,
but
you
say
despite
that
there
should
be
no
constitutional
requirement
that
the
utility
even
notify
the
person
as
to
what
the
basis
for
the
cut
off
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know,
but
i
just
--
under
my
example
the
utility
simply
notifies
the
person
you
are
cut
off,
gives
no
reason
whatsoever?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
is
some
constitutional
requirement
then
for
an
adequate
prior
notice
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
do
say
than
there
is
a
requirement
that
the
utility
beforehand,
before
cutting
off
go
through
some
procedure
to
let
the
person
know
what
his
obligation
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
utility
cuts
a
person
of
without
sending
him
the
bill?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
what
i
want
to
know,
that
is
what
the
issue
is
in
this
case,
at
least
part
of
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
under
the
statute
of
the
state,
under
the
state
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
enforced
in
tennessee?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
i
want
to
know
the
utility
cuts
the
person
off,
does
not
tell
him
why,
does
not
send
him
the
bill,
does
not
do
anything,
just
cuts
them
off
and
could
the
person
then
have
a
1983
suit
for
failure
to
provide
an
adequate
notice
beforehand,
that
is
part
of
the
issue
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
of
course
i
am,
yes
i
am
justice
byron
r.
white
i
did
not
--
i
just
said
they
did
not
send
any
bill,
they
did
not
give
him
any
notice,
now
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
answer
is
that
there
is
no
violation
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--despite
the
fact
that
there
is
a
property
interest?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
none
of
this
has
to
do
with
the
constitution?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
the
notice
said
that
you
have
not
paid
your
bill,
if
you
have
any
complaints
about
it
come
and
see
mr.
so
and
so
at
room
so
and
so
between
the
hours
of
so
and
so;
bring
any
information
you
have,
bring
your
lawyer
if
you
want
to
and
we
will
hear
your
side
of
the
story
to
see
if
we
have
made
a
mistake
and
would
that
be
enough
to
satisfy
you
before
there
is
a
cut
off?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
your
answer
is
yes?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
do
not,
you
do
not
for
example
claim
that
before
there
is
cut
off
there
has
to
be
some
independent
hearing
examiner
or
a
full
adversary
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
before
the
termination
of
service?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
what
authority
did
you
have
for
that
in
your
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
kind
of
the
hearing
was
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
not
have
any
plan
unless
the
defendant
is
a
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
state
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
about
the
other
offices?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
the
notice
said
that
if
you
have
--
you
owe
some
money,
you
are
going
to
be
cut
off
in
20
days
unless
you
pay.
if
you
have
any
objections,
file
your
suit
in
court
and
you
can
ask
for
a
preliminary
injunction,
if
you
could
not
satisfy
the
ordinary
standards
for
preliminary
injunction,
why
of
course
this
service
would
not
be
cut
off,
but
if
you
cannot
satisfy
them
it
will
be
put
off
--
the
service
would
be
cut
off,
but
of
course
then
you
can
go
ahead
and
try
your
lawsuit
and
get
damages
if
you
win,
this
is
a
state
court
suit,
that
is
the
notice
you
will
get.
would
that
satisfy
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
do
you
think
the
fourteenth
amendment
requires
an
administrative
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
really
a
full
court
hearing
is
not
good
enough
procedure
for
satisfying
the
due
process
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
you
have
this
administrative
setup
the
way
you
wanted
and
you
have
a
so
called
responsible
company
official.
would
not
it
be
enough
under
our
cases
if
after
hearing
the
customer
side
of
the
story
he
said,
i
think
there
is
probable
cause
to
believe
that
you
have
not
paid
your
bill
and
that
you
owe
some
money
and
there
is
probable
cause
to
cut
this
services
off,
is
not
suspicious,
he
does
not
have
to
make
some
final
decision,
he
just
has
to
say
some
probable
cause?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
has
been
before
the
cut
off?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that
is
what
we
are
talking
about
right
now,
before
the
cut
off?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
--
can
you
say
whether
or
not
they
can
be
sufficient?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
still
has
to
be
administrator?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
tell
me
why
this
is
a
proper
1983
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
am
really
going
to
mr.
justice
stewartâ€™s
question
to
your
colleague?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh!
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
jurisdictional
issue
though,
is
not
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
is
not
that
always
open?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
about
it
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
you
say
it
is
questionable,
what
do
you
think
the
answer
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
this
is
a
party
to
the
extent
that
memphis
gas
and
electric,
water
division
is
a
party
here,
it
should
not
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
let
us
assume
there
were
some
damages
and
would
it
be
paid
out
of
city
funds?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
they
were
to
be
paid
out
of
city
funds?
they
are
the
individual
persons?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
it
make
any
difference
under
the
eleventh
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
it
is
a
city?
