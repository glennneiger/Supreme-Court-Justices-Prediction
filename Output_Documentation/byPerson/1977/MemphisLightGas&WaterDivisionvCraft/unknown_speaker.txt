mr.
graves,
i
want
to
be
sure
the
damages
feature
this
case
is
gone,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
if
damages
are
all
--
is
the
case
rendered
moot
by
your
new
procedures?
unknown
speaker
mr.
graves,
under
tennessee
law
is
there
a
legal
right
to
receive
a
utility
service
along
as
one
pays
for
it?
unknown
speaker
this
case
involves
a
dispute
as
to
whether
or
not
the
bill
submitted
by
the
utility
was
correct?
unknown
speaker
the
position
is
that
state
law
or
remedies
were
adequate
and
no
constitutional
--
there
is
no
constitutional
entitlement
to
the
prior
hearing?
unknown
speaker
mr.
graves,
i
have
a
question
that
i
would
have
asked
earlier
because
it
is
really
a
special
question.
how
is
your
client
memphis
light,
gas
&
water
division
of
the
city
of
memphis
immutable
to
suit
at
all
under
1983
because
of
the
dr.
monroe
against
pape
in
city
of
kenosha
and
others?
unknown
speaker
i
know
it
is
in
the
part
of
judge
peck's
opinion
in
the
court
of
appeals
says
that
the
district
court
correctly
i
think
says
that
the
district
court
after
trail
found
that
there
was
no
civil
rights
jurisdiction
over
municipal
mlg&w.
the
foot
note
cite
to
a
case
and
he
says
nothing
further
about
it
in
the
entire
opinion.
he
neither
affirms,
the
court
neither
affirms
nor
reverses
that,
but
it
is
not
a
correct
holding
under
the
--
unknown
speaker
but
that
has
been
decided
that
you
are
out
of
the
case,
has
not
it,
by
the
district
court
and
it
was
not
reversed
in
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
would
you
agree
that
if
the
court
of
appeals,
through
judge
peck
is
correct
in
saying
that
the
district
court
held
that
you
were
not
sueable
under
1983
that
was
the
correct
holding?
unknown
speaker
because
you
are
a
municipality?
unknown
speaker
of
the
city
of
memphis
actually?
unknown
speaker
first
of
all
before
you
get
to
that,
do
you
concede
then
that
there
is
property?
unknown
speaker
alright.
so,
now
when
you
are
moving
on
to
talk
about
the
procedures
that
you
do
provide,
you
are
saying,
assuming
arguendo
there
was
deprivation
of
property,
but
only
arguendo,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
just
ask
one
question
on
the
property
issue?
assume
for
a
moment
you
have
a
customer
who
has
not
paid
his
bill
and
the
utility
admits
he
has
paid
his
bill,
could
the
utility
cut
his
services
off
without
notice
and
so
forth,
without
raising
any
federal
question?
i
realize
you
would
have
a
state
law
i
believe?
unknown
speaker
you
say
even
there,
there
is
no
property
interest?
unknown
speaker
i
know
he
has
a
lot
of
state
law
remedies,
does
he
also
not
have
a
state
law
right
to
continued
service,
if
he
has
paid
his
bills?
unknown
speaker
now
why
is
that
not
property
within
the
meaning
of
fourteenth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
no,
no
mistake
at
all.
they
know
it.
they
say
we
just
have
decided
to
cut
you
off.
you
paid
your
bills,
we
are
going
to
violate
the
state
law,
we
got
all
sorts
of
reasons,
you
are
bad
person,
whatever
it
may
be,
does
he
have
a
federal
property
interest
in
having
continued
service,
does
he
have
a
property
interest
in
continued
service
when
he
has
paid
his
bills
and
everybody
acknowledges
he
has
paid
his
bills,
is
that
a
property
right
within
the
meaning
of
fourteenth
amendment
and
if
not,
why
not?
unknown
speaker
i
know
it,
i
am
nor
asking
you
as
a
matter
of
(voice
overlap)
because
that
is
submitted
that
he
has
--
unknown
speaker
now
why
is
that
not
a
property
right
within
the
meaning
of
--?
unknown
speaker
but
you
have
a
state
law
that
says
you
must
provide
the
service
--
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
the
law
followed
in
the
state
of
tennessee?
unknown
speaker
do
you
not
have
a
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
to
that
effect?
unknown
speaker
you
have
not
drawn
a
distinction
between
the
law
declared
by
your
court
and
law
declared
by
your
legislature?
unknown
speaker
in
roth
that
you
cite,
was
that
state
statute?
unknown
speaker
you
are
talking
about
goss
v.
lopez?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
cited
roth?
unknown
speaker
was
that
the
statutory
right
or
one
(voice
overlap)?
unknown
speaker
but
would
that
have
made
a
difference?
suppose
the
university
board
had
prescribed
tenure?
unknown
speaker
massey's
is
not
government?
unknown
speaker
the
fourteenth
amendment
applies
only
to
state
--
unknown
speaker
that
is
sort
of
ombudsman
type?
