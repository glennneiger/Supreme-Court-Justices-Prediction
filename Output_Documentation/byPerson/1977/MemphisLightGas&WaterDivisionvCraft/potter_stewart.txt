mr.
daniel,
in
addition
to
the
claim
if
there
was
a
deprivation
of
the
property
here
without
due
process
of
law,
there
was
also
a
claim
on
behalf
a
party
named
holmes
that
there
was
a
denial
equal
protection
of
the
law
by
the
defendant?
justice
potter
stewart
nobody
has
talked
about
that.
what
happened
to
that
in
the
court
of
appeal
and
what
is
your
position?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
is
out
of
the
case?
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
that
was
a
refusal
to
install
i
think,
was
not
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
is
no
appeal
from
that?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
thank
you.
