justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
respondents
in
this
case
are
home
owners
in
memphis,
tennessee.
they
are
utility
customers
for
gas
and
electric
service
of
the
gas,
light
and
water
division
of
the
city
of
memphis.
the
dispute
arose
with
respect
to
of
what
respondents
thought
was
double
billing
and
during
the
relevant
period,
respondent's
utility
service
was
terminated
on
five
occasions,
allegedly
for
non-payment
of
bills.
respondents
were
not
explicitly
advised
as
to
how
and
before
whom
the
dispute
could
resolved.
respondents
brought
this
action
against
the
city's
utility
division
and
several
of
its
officers.
they
claimed
that
service
has
been
terminated
without
affording
them
the
fair
opportunity
to
be
heard.
injunctive
and
damage
relief
were
sought.
under
tennessee
law
the
right
to
continued
utility
service
so
long
as
proper
bills
were
paid
is
a
protected
interest
in
the
property.
thus
respondents
could
not
lawfully
be
deprived
of
this
interest
without
notice
and
a
fair
opportunity
to
be
heard.
although
the
district
court
rejected
respondent's
claim.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
petitioner's
procedure
with
respect
to
the
termination
of
service
did
not
comport
with
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
the
appellate
court
view
the
constitutional
guarantee
requires
that
a
publicly
owned
utility
provide
due
notice
of
the
proposed
termination
and
an
established
procedure
of
resolution
of
disputed
bills.
termination
of
utility
service
can
effect
health
and
even
life
itself.
for
the
reasons
stated
more
fully
in
the
opinion
filed
today
with
a
clerk,
we
agree
with
petitioners,
we
agree
that
that
petitioner's
dispute
resolution
procedure,
failed
to
afford
respondents
a
fair
opportunity
for
the
informal
resolution
of
disputed
bills.
accordingly
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
join.
