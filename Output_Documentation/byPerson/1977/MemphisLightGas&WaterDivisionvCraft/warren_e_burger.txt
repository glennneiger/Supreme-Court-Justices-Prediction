we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
76-39,
memphis
light
&
gas
against
craft.
mr.
graves
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
a
fair
quarreler
of
what
you
have
just
suggested
is
that
the
paying
customer
should
not
be
required
to
subsidize
the
non-paying
customers?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
may
i
ask
you
a
hypothetical
question
to
see
if
it
would
shed
some
light
on
this
problem
on
your
position
for
me.
a
newspaper
is
not
a
public
utility,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
they
serve
people
at
their
homes
with
a
carrier
service
to
bring
a
newspaper
there.
would
you
say
there
is
any
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
newspaper,
enforceable
obligation
to
deliver
newspapers
just
because
people
want
it
or
can
they
refuse
anyone
they
want?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
a
utility
on
the
other
hand
is
not
free
to
refuse
service,
is
it,
in
arkansas?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
mean,
in
the
first
instance
if
the
customer
calls
up
and
says
i
want
water,
gas
and
electricity,
they
must
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
willing
to
(voice
overlap)
my
question
assumes,
they
are
on
the
main
line.
so
that
distinction
is
of
some
importance
to
this
case,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
the
newspaper
could
give
you
a
subscription
free
because
they
might
think
it
was
good
for
them
to
have
you
on
their
subscriber
list,
but
charge
me
or
next
door
neighbor
the
full
price,
could
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
cannot
do
that
in
the
utility?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
in
tennessee
there
are
some
privately
owned
utilities,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
those
privately
owned
utilities
function
by
virtue
of
the
grant
or
franchise
from
the
state,
do
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
assume
it
is
as
in
other
states,
the
franchisee
itself
defines
the
right
of
every
person
within
the
reach
of
the
service
to
receive
that
service,
if
he
pays
for
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
would
you
say
it
was
respect
to
a
private
utility
that
is
or
is
not
a
property
right
in
fourteenth
amendment
terms?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
you
have
draw
no
distinction
between
a
private
utility
in
this
respect
and
the
public
(voice
overlap)?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
daniel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
a
small
claims
--
you
have
a
small
claims
court
system
in
tennessee?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
when
you
are
say
an
independent
hearing
examiner,
did
not
goldberg
against
kelly
simply
say
that
it
must
be
within
the
organization,
the
granting
organization
but
a
different
person
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
do
not
you
think
that
the
natural
urge
of
a
utility
just
sell
as
much
of
its
product
as
possible
or
gives
them
a
certain
amount
of
independence
in
that
respect?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
i
want
to
be
clear
that
you
are
not
asking
that
the
fact
finder
to
resolve
this
dispute
must
be
independent
and
neutral
apart
from
the
utility?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
cannot
be
an
employee
of
the
utility.
you
said
i
think
a
responsible
representative?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
not
sure
what
official
means.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
that
is
the
first
time
you
have
used
the
used
term
hearing
examiner.
previously
you
had
said
i
thought
any
responsible
employee
of
the
company.
there
is
quite
a
difference
between
that
and
a
hearing
examiner,
those
ought
to
have
some
connotations
that
responsible
official
doe
not
have?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
was
partly
related
to
the
fact
that
they
had
an
off
again,
on
again
program
on
their
own
part.
so
two
meters
and
then
one
meter
and
then
two
meters.
they
have
brought
on
some
of
these
problems
by
their
own
indecision,
did
they
not
or
changes
of
decisions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
this
has
been
litigated
for
nearly
5
years,
has
not
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
73
i
suppose?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
uou
have
anything
further
mr.
graves?
you
have
just
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
does
not
solve
the
problem
which
seems
to
be
hanging
in
air,
whether
their
due
process
right
such
as
the
sixth
circuit
has
outlined
it,
is
satisfied
if
they
do
not
get
the
answer
they
like?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
memphis
light,
gas
&
water
division
against
craft
will
be
announced
by
mr.
