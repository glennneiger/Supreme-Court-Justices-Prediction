mr.
daniel
there
is
a
reason
for
that,
it
is
probably
the
utility
or
that
is
the
state?
justice
thurgood
marshall
their
commissioners?
justice
thurgood
marshall
their
state
offices?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
graves
suggested
you
go
to
the
credit
department,
will
that
be
okay?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
court
would
not
have
to
supervise
this,
would
they
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
what
worries
me?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
mean
due
process
is
a
--
it
is
about
like
that,
is
it
not?
who
would
decide
that
how
much
due
process
was
going
on?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean,
if
you
put
it,
you
said
somebody
cursed
over
to
phone.
well,
if
they
put
that
person
in
charge
in
this
division
that
would
not
help,
would
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
would
help?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
to
enforce
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
can
you
do
that
in
a
public
utility?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
he
could
enforce
and
say
call
the
chairman
of
the
board
or
was
it
the
counsel
or
whatever
these
things
called?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
he
would
be
over
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
the
person
have
one
a
month,
have
a
hearing
once
a
month?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean,
that
if
the
complaint
is
which
i
do
not
know
about
you,
but
i
had
a
same
complaint
every
month,
my
bill
is
too
much,
so
i
would
go
there
each
month
and
have
a
hearing
and
there
all
i
would
say
is
this
is
too
much
and
the
company
would
say
well
here
is
the
meter
reading
then
what
else
would
you
do,
nothing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
that
seem
silly
to
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
dispute
is
that
you
have
double
bill,
which
obviously
was
a
mistake?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
will
never
have
a
hearing
whether
who
made
the
mistake,
you
are
never
have
a
hearing
with
the
computer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
i
do
not
see
what
the
hearing
would
be
about?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
also
the
cost
to
the
hearing?
