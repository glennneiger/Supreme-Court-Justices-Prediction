mr.
daniel
may
i
ask
you
a
question
please?
i
would
like
to
ask
about
the
your
objection
to
the
notice
in
the
court
of
appeals
holding,
and
notice
and
put
to
one
side
the
hearing
problem
and
also
of
course
i
am
just
asking
you
about
the
constitutional
requirement
as
to
inadequate
notice
as
opposed
to
what
a
commission
might
say
is
desirable
in
the
sense
of
telling
the
customer
how
to
go
in
and
straighten
up
the
dispute.
your
point
is
i
understand
it
is
that
the
notice
although
it
told
the
customer
of
the
harm
that
was
about
to
occur,
namely
you
are
going
to
be
cut
off,
it
did
not
explain
to
the
customer
the
procedure
to
be
followed
in
avoiding
that
harm?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
is
there
any
precedent
that
you
know
of
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
for
holding
that
a
notice
must
do
more
than
tell
the
person
to
be
harmed
about
the
prospective
harm,
but
must
go
further
and
in
effect
give
them
legal
advice
as
to
what
his
possible
remedies
must
be?
justice
john
paul
stevens
often
i
suppose
the
--
in
a
serious
matter
that
one
citizen
gets
a
notice
that
something
is
about
to
happen,
one
thing
he
can
do
is
ask
a
lawyer
for
help.
presumably
if
either
of
these
people
asked
a
lawyer
for
help
they
would
have
been
straightened
out
in
a
hurry?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
would
leverage
the
president
of
the
company,
so
you
terminate
this
service
you
are
going
to
be
get
sued
for
three
million
dollars
or
something
like
that,
might
not
have
got
an
action?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
record
tells
us
how
often
there
are
disputes
about
the
amount
of
the
bill
as
opposed
to
the
questions
of
credit
and
things
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
right
as
required
by
state
regulation.
