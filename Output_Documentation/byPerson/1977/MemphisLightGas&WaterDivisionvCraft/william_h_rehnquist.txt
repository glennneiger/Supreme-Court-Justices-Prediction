justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
sixth
circuit's
analysis
on
this
one
was
based
on
its,
at
least
in
part
on
it
palmer
case,
was
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that
did
not
address
tennessee
law
at
all
as
i
read
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
understand
to
be
the
reasoning
of
the
sixth
circuit
as
to
why
they
continued
to
say
the
utility
services
is
a
property
under
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
the
state
action
in
goss
is
quite
different
from
the
property
interest?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
source
of
the
obligation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
if
you
agree
with
mr.
justice
white’s
question
to
a
moment,
well,
then
you
are
conceding
that
there
is
some
sort
of
a
limited
property
or
you
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
if
i
walk
into
massey's
and
ask
him
to
charge
something
for
me
i
take
it
even
if
massey's
is
partly
owned
by
the
city
of
new
york,
they
are
free
to
tell
me
no
we
are
not
going
to
charge?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
the
fact
that
i
may
be
a
delinquent
creditor
and
they
have
not
send
me
a
bill,
does
not
mean
that
they
have
--
that
something
in
the
constitution
gives
me
a
property
right
to
get
my
next
transaction
charged,
but
am
i
not
right
in
thinking
that
tennessee
treats
the
utility
somewhat
differently
then
it
would
massey’s?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
their
president,
vice-president,
are
they
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
so
far
you
have
largely
in
response
to
question,
you
have
quite
addressed
yourself
to
the
due
process
aspect
of
the
case
mr.
daniel.
do
you
think
the
sixth
circuit’s
analysis
of
the
property
interest
question
which
i
suppose
logically
comes
before
the
due
process
inquiry
as
satisfactory
in
the
light
of
roth
and
sindermann?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
did
not
appeal
or
seek
to
assert
from
that
portion
of
the
sixth
circuit’s
opinion
which
held
that
where
the
bill
is
undisputed,
judgment
goes
for
the
defendant
in
the
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
use
the
term
hearing
the
case
which
certainly,
i
would
think
does
nothing
to
dispel
the
fears
that
some
of
us
may
share
with
justice
marshall.
if
this
is
a
case,
that
goes
before
a
hearing
examiner,
you
really
have
a
brand
new
division
of
the
utility.
are
you
suggesting
that
formal,
a
procedure
is
required
simply
by
the
language
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
says
no
property
shall
be
taken
without
due
process?
