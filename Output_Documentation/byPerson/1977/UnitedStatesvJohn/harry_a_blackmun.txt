harry
a.
blackmun
these
two
related
cases
come
to
us
respectively
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
in
new
orleans
and
from
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
mississippi.
they
present
issues
concerning
state
and
federal
jurisdiction
over
certain
crimes
allegedly
committed
by
an
indian
within
the
area
designated
as
a
reservation
for
the
choctaws
who
reside
in
central
mississippi.
the
technical
question
is
whether
the
lands
are
indian
country,
as
that
phrase
is
defined
the
criminal
code
and
as
it
is
used
in
what
is
called
the
major
crimes
act
of
1885
and
secondarily,
the
issue
was
whether
if
the
lands
are
indian
country,
the
federal
statutes
operate
to
preclude
the
exercise
of
state
criminal
jurisdiction
over
the
offense.
in
october
1975,
smith
john,
a
choctaw
was
indicted
by
a
federal
grand
jury
for
assault
with
intent
to
kill.
he
was
convicted
of
simple
assault
and
received
a
sentence
of
90
days
and
a
fine.
on
appeal
the
fifth
circuit
reversed,
it
ruled
that
a
federal
trial
court
was
without
jurisdiction
over
the
case
because
the
place
where
the
alleged
assault
took
place
was
not
indian
country
and
therefore
there
was
no
basis
for
federal
jurisdiction.
a
little
while
after
the
federal
indictment,
smith
john
was
also
indicted
by
a
mississippi
state
grand
jury
for
aggravated
assault
upon
the
same
victim.
the
incident
was
the
same
as
the
one
to
which
the
federal
indictment
related.
there
was
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
that
the
federal
jurisdiction
was
exclusive
and
that
motion
was
denied.
the
defendant
was
then
convicted
in
the
state
court
and
this
time
received
a
sentence
of
two
years
in
the
penitentiary.
on
appeal,
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
held
as
had
the
federal
appellate
court
that
the
federal
trial
court
had
no
jurisdiction
to
prosecute
and
neither
that
mississippi
court
did.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
attempt
to
trace
the
very
interesting
history
of
the
mississippi
choctaws
and
their
dealings
with
the
united
states
government
from
the
time
of
the
revolutionary
war
down
to
the
present
time.
we
conclude
that
the
lands
designated
as
reservation
in
central
mississippi
is
indeed
indian
country
as
defined
in
the
federal
statutes
and
that
as
a
consequence
those
statutes
make
an
indian
who
commits
certain
specified
offenses
within
indian
country,
is
subject
to
the
laws
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.
neither
the
fact
that
the
choctaws
in
mississippi
are
merely
a
remnant
of
the
much
larger
group,
one
of
the
five
civilized
tribes
that
went
or
were
moved
to
what
is
now
oklahoma,
nor
the
fact
that
federal
supervision
over
them
has
not
been
continuous
throughout
the
years,
affects
the
federal
power
to
deal
with
them
under
these
statutes.
and
thus
we
conclude
that
the
federal
prosecution
of
a
choctaw
for
assault
with
intent
to
kill
occurring
on
the
lands
in
question
is
proper
and
that
mississippi
had
no
power
similarly
the
prosecuting
for
the
same
events.
and
thus
the
judgment
of
the
mississippi
supreme
court
is
reversed
and
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
is
also
reversed
and
that
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
the
opinion
filed
today.
