mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
these
consolidated
cases
from
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
present
a
common
central
issue,
and
that
is
whether
lands
purchased
by
the
united
states
and
held
in
trust
for
the
mississippi
band
of
choctaw
indians,
and
declared
a
reservation
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
pursuant
to
the
indian
reorganization
act,
constitute
indian
country
within
the
definition
found
in
18
u.s.c.
1151.
the
state
case
also
presents
a
dependent
issue,
whether
if
these
lands
are
indian
country,
the
federal
courts
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
crimes
involving
indians,
as
they
traditionally
do,
or
whether
the
history
of
the
mississippi
choctaws
in
some
way
compels
a
departure
from
the
generally
accepted
rule.
now,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
briefly
at
the
outset
that
what
we
are
talking
about
in
terms
of
federal
jurisdiction
here
is
not
a
plenary,
sovereign
jurisdiction,
excluding
all
state
jurisdiction,
but
simply
the
limited
preemptive
authority
over
matters
involving
indians
that
is
common
in
indian
country.
for
reasons
that
i
shall
discuss,
we
believe
that
the
choctaw
lands
are
indian
country,
and
thus
is
subject,
insofar
as
crimes
involving
indians
are
concerned,
solely
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
no,
i
am
saying
that
our
position
with
respect
to
this
reservation
is
the
same,
but
is
no
broader
than
that.
that
when
we
talk
about
exclusive
jurisdiction,
we
are
not
suggesting
for
instance
that
the
state
does
not
have
jurisdiction
over
crimes
solely
involving
non-indians,
as
it
does
under
the
mcbratney
rule,
or
that
it
would
not
have
sovereign
jurisdiction
over
its
citizens
if
they
go
off
the
reservation.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
well,
there
are
tracts
in
seven
different
counties.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
well,
i
am
not
sure
what
you
mean
by
separate
pieces.
there
are…
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
well,
i
am
not
sure
what
the
answer
to
that
is.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
that
is
right,
that
is
correct.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
there
are
more
than
seven
areas
which
are
not
fully
contiguous,
but
there
are
seven
basic
areas
as
i
understand
it
that
comprise
the
reservation,
does
not...
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
those
collectively
should
be
treated
as
parts
of
the
reservation,
that
is
correct.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
not
in
this
particular
issue,
no.
that
does
perhaps
have
a
relevance
to
another
issue,
which
i
will
mention
in
a
moment.
these
cases
arise
out
of
a
single
incident
that
occurred
on
the
choctaw
lands.
in
october
1975,
a
federal
grand
jury
indicted
respondent,
john,
who
is
a
full-blooded
mississippi
choctaw
indian,
for
assault
with
intent
to
kill
one
artis
jenkins,
under
18
u.s.c.
1153,
which
the
court
is
familiar
with,
is
the
major
crimes
act.
the
indictment
stated
that
the
offense
occurred
on
and
within
the
choctaw
indian
reservation,
and
on
land
within
the
indian
country
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.
in
the
trial
the
government
requested
an
instruction,
not
only
on
the
offense
charged,
but
on
assault
with
a
dangerous
weapon
with
intent
to
do
bodily
harm.
while
the
defendant
relying
on
keeble
vs.
united
states,
412
u.s.,
asked
for
an
instruction
on
the
lesser
included
offense
of
simple
assault,
as
defined
in
18
u.s.c.
113(e).
the
instructions
were
given,
the
respondent
was
acquitted
of
the
major
crimes,
but
convicted
of
simple
assault,
sentenced
to
90
days
imprisonment,
with
$300
fine.
after
post
trial
motions,
respondent
appealed
his
conviction
to
the
fifth
circuit,
arguing
that
although
keeble
required
the
giving
of
an
instruction
on
the
lesser
included
offense,
the
district
court
lacked
jurisdiction
to
enter
a
judgment
of
conviction
on
that
offense,
and
this
is
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stevens.
we
have
suggested
that
if
the
court
accepts
our
position
on
these
lands
as
indian
country,
that
it
remand
the
case
to
the
fifth
circuit
to
consider
that
issue,
because
it
is
possible
that
the
race
of
the
victim
maybe
a
factor
in
determining
that
jurisdictional
question.
but
the
record
simply
does
not
show
whether
the
victim
was
an
indian
or
non-indian,
and
respondent
did
not
urge
that
here.
in
any
event,
the
fifth
circuit
did
not
reach
the
issue
but
asked
the
department
of
justice
to
file
a
brief
discussing
whether
the
crime
occurred
in
indian
country
at
all.
the
department
of
justice
took
the
position
in
its
brief,
a
position
with
which
respondent
agreed,
that
the
crime
did
occur
in
indian
country,
but
the
fifth
circuit
disagreed,
for
reasons
that
i
will
discuss
shortly,
and
reversed
the
convictions.
meanwhile,
after
the
federal
prosecution
was
completed,
state
authorities
also
obtained
an
indictment
against
john
for
exactly
the
same
offense,
charging
aggravated
assault
under
the
mississippi
statutes.
he
moved
to
dismiss
the
indictment
on
grounds
that
the
federal
courts
had
exclusive
jurisdiction.
the
motion
was
denied,
and
he
was
convicted,
and
sentenced
to
two
years
imprisonment.
the
mississippi
supreme
court,
in
a
decision
that
was
actually
rendered
before
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
decision,
held
that
these
lands
were
not
indian
country,
and
thus
that
the
state
had
exclusive
jurisdiction.
it
therefore
affirmed
the
conviction.
now,
turning
first
to
the
provisions
of
section
1151,
the
statute
defining
indian
country,
which
are
found
at
page
40a
of
the
appendix
to
our
petition
for
certiorari,
we
submit
that
contrary
to
the
conclusions
reached
by
the
courts
below,
these
lands
held
in
trust
with
the
choctaws
fit
very
comfortably
within
the
definition
of
indian
country
found
there.
to
begin
with,
1151(a)
includes
within
indian
country
all
lands
within
the
limits
of
any
indian
reservation
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.
this
court
for
over
60
years
has
recognized
that
such
reservation
lands,
even
if
they
are
not
original
indian
lands,
are
indian
country,
so
long
as
the
court
said
in
donnelly,
they
are
lawfully
set
apart
as
an
indian
reservation.
here,
the
secretary
of
the
interior…
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
the
language
that
i
just
quoted
from
donnelly
was
prior
to
the
definition.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
the
court
has
recognized
that
the
federal
courts
have
jurisdiction,
leaving
aside
exclusive
jurisdiction
for
a
moment,
over
reservations
for
much
longer
than
60
years.
the
point
that
i
was
raising
here
is
that
for
a
certain
time,
it
was
recognized
that
only
original
indian
lands
comprised
of
an
indian
reservation,
and
then
in
donnelly,
the
court
departed
from
that,
and
for
the
first
time
recognized
something
that
now
has
been
picked
up
by
congress
in
the
definition
of
indian
country,
that
they
do
not
have
to
be
original
indian
lands,
as
long
as
they
are
lawfully
set
apart
for
the
indians.
in
any
event,
as
i
was
saying…
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
to
declare
this
a
reservation?
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
well,
i
think
that
is
because
of
the
history
of
the
choctaws
which
we
have
set
out
in
our
brief,
which
shows
that
what
he
was
doing
in
this
particular
case
was
declaring
a
reservation
for
a
group
of
indians
who
were
left
behind
when
the
original
choctaw
tribe
moved
to
the
western
territory,
so
that
is
why
he
was
coming
at
this
late
time
to
provide
a
reservation
for
them.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
i
am
sorry.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
that
is
correct,
but
what
we
are
concerned
with
here
is
the
provisions
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
then
made
for
the
ones
who
remained
in
mississippi.
what
he
did
was
acting
pursuant
to
section
7
of
the
indian
reorganization
act,
which
contains
an
explicit
authorization
that
the
secretary
can
declare
new
indian
reservations.
he
proclaimed
those
lands
a
reservation,
and
that
status
continues
to
the
present
time,
and
of
course
includes
the
period
of
time
during
which
the
offenses
here
were
committed.
therefore,
our
first
submission
is
that
we
think
it
is
plain
on
its
face
that
these
lands
fit
within
the
definition
in
1151(a).
in
addition,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
1151(b)
speaks
to
all
dependent
indian
communities
within
the
borders
of
the
united
states.
while
i
do
not
intend
to
go
back
through
the
entire
history
of
the
choctaws,
which
we
have
set
out
at
pages
18
to
23
of
our
brief,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
the
united
states,
having
finally
been
moved
by
the
sorrowful
plight
of
the
mississippi
choctaws,
after
the
remainder
of
their
tribe
moved
to
the
western
territory,
has
been
providing
benefits
for
this
tribe,
including
educational
benefits,
schools,
lands,
agricultural
benefits,
since
1918,
and
has
held
their
lands…
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
well,
they
organized
under
the
indian
reorganization
act,
and
that
was
approved
by
the
secretary
of
interior
in
1945.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
what
it
was
doing
was
providing
aid
to
a
group
of
indians
who...
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
well,
it
was
providing
it
to
a…
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
well,
in
1939
for
example,
they
did
provide
for
these
lands
to
be
held
in
trust
for
the
common
benefit
of
the
mississippi
choctaws,
so
that
was
certainly
a
legislation
for
a
group,
and
i
think
logically
the
provision
of
schools
is
for
them
as
a
group,
it
is
not
just
purely
for
a
single
individual.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
i
intend
to
get
to
that
right
away.
what
i
was
just
pointing
out
at
the
outset
is,
that
aside
from
those
arguments
it
seems
to
me
quite
clear
that
these
lands
fit
within
the
definition
of
indian
country
in
section
1151,
and
it
is
just
a
question
now
of
whether
in
some
way
congress
was
disabled
from
putting
them
there.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
i
think
what
that
does
is
that
it
gives
the
federal
courts
jurisdiction
over
crimes
committed
by
indians
in
indian
country.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
assuming
that
these
are
legitimately
indian
country,
and
the
congress
had
the
power
to
make
them
indian
country,
then
that
is
right.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
at
this
particular
point,
it
does
not
need
to,
although
i
should
point
out
at
this
time
that
generally
the
federal
jurisdiction
over
crimes
involving
indians
in
indian
country
is
exclusive
of
state
jurisdiction.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
the
reason
would
be
though,
because
that
is
something
that
congress
could
not
validly
do,
as
i
will
explain
in
just
a
moment.
but
if
indeed
this
is
an
indian
reservation
that
congress
was
entitled
to
establish,
or
dependent
indian
community
that
congress
was
entitled
to
establish,
then
it
seems
that
the
normal
jurisdictional
rules,
which
are
that
the
federal
courts
have
jurisdiction
over
the
crimes
committed
by
indians
or
involving
indians,
to
the
exclusion
of
the
state
should
apply,
i
do
not
see
any
reason
why
they
should
not.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
no,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
do
not
say
that.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
he
would
not
be
living
in
indian
country
by
the
very
hypothesis
that
you
put
forward.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
that
is
right.
that
is
what
gives
the
federal
courts
jurisdiction
over
these
areas,
and
that
is
what
include
as
reservations
and
dependent
indian
communities.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
that
is
somewhat
of
an
unsettled
question.
whether
the
jurisdiction
in
indian
country
in
1152
and
1153
applies
to
people
who
have
no
connection
with
the
indian
reservation
or
the
dependent
indian
community
where
they
are
found,
is
something
that
this
court
noted
in
antelope,
is
left
open,
but
that
certainly
is
not
the
case
here.
if
these
lands
are
a
reservation
or
a
dependent
indian
community,
certainly
smith
john
was
a
member
of
that
community,
or
a
member
of
that
band
living
on
the
reservation.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
i
think
that
those
maybe
separated
out,
although
i
think
the
third
in
this
case
really
is
sort
of
a
false
issue.
i
think
that
our
positions
succinctly
stated
is
that
there
is...
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
well,
i
certainly
hope
it
is,
but
i
also
think
it
is.
our
position
is
that
the
federal
courts
do
have
jurisdiction
over
these
lands
because
it
is
indian
country,
that
that
jurisdiction
as
in
normal
use
of
federal
lands
and
in
normal
situations
involving
indian
country
or
dependent
indian
communities
is
exclusive
of
state
jurisdiction,
and
finally,
that
they
do
have
jurisdiction
over
smith
john
himself,
who
is
the
only
person
at
issue
here,
because
he
is
a
member
of
the
band
that
occupies
those
lands.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
i
thought
it
was
a
straight
a
line
as
i
ever...
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
well,
i
agree
one
has
to
follow
from
the
other,
but
you
can
follow
in
a
straight
line
as
well
as
a
circle.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
well,
let
me
go
ahead
to
that
because
i
do
think
that,
that...
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
well,
i
do
not
think
it
is
too
late.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
the
notion
that
the
treaty
of
dancing
rabbit
creek
in
1830
somehow
set
in
stone
the
relationship
between
the
choctaws
and
mississippi
and
the
federal
government,
i
do
not
think
it
is
supported
by
any
authority.
it
is
true
that
the
treaty
apparently
contemplated
that
the
choctaws
that
did
not
go
to
the
western
territory,
would
stay
behind,
would
receive
land,
and
would
presumably
fend
for
themselves
as
citizens
of
the
state
of
mississippi.
the
united
states
certainly
did
not
in
the
treaty
surrender
explicitly
any
power
to
help
them
if
that
proved
to
be
unworkable.
the
state
of
mississippi
of
course
is
not
entitled
to
rely
on
any
promises
there
anyway,
because
it
was
not
a
party
to
the
treaty,
it
was
not
made
for
their
benefit.
even
if
the
treaty
could
somehow
be
read
to
include
that
sort
of
promise
by
the
united
states,
it
is
clear
from
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
congress
can
amend
treaties
by
later
treaties,
and
by
subsequent
legislation.
it
would
seem
to
me
extremely
curious,
as
well
as
unfortunate,
if
that
principle,
which
has
often
been
used
to
change
treaties
over
the
indian
subjection,
was
now
somehow
unavailable
to
change
a
treaty
for
their
benefit
and
with
their
acquiescence.
now,
the
point
that
justice
white
makes
is
that
after
that
period
of
time,
they
were
no
longer
a
tribe,
and
therefore
that
congress',
as
i
understand
it,
constitutional
power
had
somehow
lapsed
over
the
choctaws,
but
i
think
that
is
too
grudging
a
view
of
congress
power
in
indian
affairs.
tribal
existence
,like
tribal
sovereignty,
provides
the
necessary
backdrop
for
viewing
the
relationship
between
the
american
indians
and
the
federal
government.
this
court
has
already
recognized
that
a
continuing
tribal
existence
is
not
a
sine
qua
non,
but
congressional
power
to
deal
with
indian
affairs.
for
example,
in
the
case
that
we
have
discussed
in
our
brief,
in
mcgowan,
the
court
approved
the
exercise
as
congressional
jurisdiction
over
lands
purchased
for
indians
in
nevada;
many
of
whom
were
not
members
of
an
established
tribe
at
that
point.
indeed
logically,
if
congress
lost
its
power
to
provide
for
the
indians
at
the
instant
that
an
individual
indian
severed
his
tribal
relationship,
or
the
tribe
for
some
reason
disbanded,
it
would
completely
prevent
congress
from
experimenting
with
independence
for
the
tribes,
because
once
the
tribe
gained
some
measure
of
independence,
to
that
degree,
congress
would
lose
its
ability
to
correct
the
situation
if
the
tribes
were
unable
to
cope
with
that
independence.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
well,
and
we
are
talking
again
about
exclusive
jurisdiction,
this
is
a
point
i
made
originally;
the
type
of
jurisdiction
they
are
asserting
there
is
not
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
that
you
get
under
the
arsenals
and
dock-yards
clause
for
example,
if
the
state
consents
to
give
it
to
you,
where
basically
you
become
the
full
entire
sovereign
for
that
area
and
the
state
just
keeps
out,
with
some
limited
exception.
what
we
are
saying
here
is
that
as
this
court
recognized
in
surplus
trading
co.
vs.
cook,
that
the
state
continues
to
be
a
sovereign
over
these
areas.
it
continues
to
have
certain
sovereign
rights
over
these
areas.
what
the
state
does
not
have,
and
this
is
exactly
what
the
court
said
in
surplus
trading
co.
by
way
of
example.
what
this
state
does
not
have
is
full
sovereignty
over
the
indian
wards.
the
federal
government
has
a
sovereignty,
and
to
that
extent
it
preempts
that
bit
of
state
sovereignty.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
if
they
are
not
indians,
they
cannot
do
it,
is
the
answer.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
it
is
grounded
on
the
provision
to
regulate
commerce
with
the
tribes,
the
treaty
power
making
with
the
tribes,
and
the
powers
that
flow
from
that,
that
this
court
has
recognized
in
numerous
cases.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
no,
it
would
not.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
assuming
that
the
indians
would
take
it,
it
seems
to
me
that
their
power
to
deal
with
the
indians
at
all
depends
on
some
sort
of
original
tribal
nexus.
this
court
in
sandoval
said
that
congress
cannot
arbitrarily
bring…
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
that
maybe,
but
on
the
issue
of
the
indian
power,
the
court
did
say
in
sandoval
that
congress
could
not
exercise
that
power
simply
by
arbitrarily
calling
a
group
of
people
an
indian
tribe.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
well,
the
secretary
of
the
interior…
he
can
do
it
if
congress
authorizes
it,
but
congress
has
not
authorized
it.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
under
the
indian
reorganization
act,
congress
did
certain
things
directly
and
authorized
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
do
the
rest
under
the
indian
reorganization
act,
so
he
did
have
that
authorization.
but
back
in
the
sandoval
point
for
a
second,
the
court
said
you
cannot
just
call
anybody…
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
well,
blood
would
certainly
be
part
of
it,
it
depends
if
the
court
said
there
on
a
distinctly
indian
community.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
that
is
correct,
i
cannot,
i
have
no
indian
ground.
in
fact,
the
indian
reorganization
act
applies
only
to
indians
of
one
half
or
more
indian
blood.
but
it
is
a
distinctly
indian
community,
and
the
mississippi
choctaws
have
a
common
history.
they
have
common
heritage.
they
have
common
customs,
and
they
have
a
common
language.
in
1918,
when
congress
began
legislating
for
the
choctaws,
they
had
a
report
from
the
agent
in
front
of
them
that
said
everyone
of
the
choctaws
still
spoke
choctaw,
and
many
of
them
spoke
it
as
the
only
language.
so
this
is
not
a
group
of
indians
that
has
been
completely…
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
you
are
right,
i
had
better
limit
that
to
the
mississippi
choctaws,
and
that
is
whom
i
am
talking
about.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
i
am
speaking,
and
i
apologize
for
not
being
precise
enough,
i
am
speaking
of
the
mississippi
choctaws.
but
congress
recognized
at
that
time
that
they
had
not
been
assimilated
into
mississippi
society.
this
court
said
in
winton
vs.
amos,
they
were
denied
all
political,
social
privileges,
and
their
children
could
not
go
to
the
state
schools.
so
it
is
not
clear
how
they
were
going
to
be
assimilated,
even
if
that
had
been
the
purpose
of
the
actions
prior
to
that
time.
so
i
do
not
think
that,
although
there
clearly
are
limits
to
the
power
to
reach
out
and
just
find
someone
in
general
non-indian
society,
even
if
he
has
a
very
distant
indian
ancestry,
and
pulling
within
the
reach
of
the
power,
it
does
not
seem
to
me
that
that
is
the
situation
in
this
case.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
the
dependent
indian
communities,
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
necessary
that
they
absolutely
be
populated
by
an
indian
community.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
well,
i
think
that
they...
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
they
are
exclusively
enough
indians
so
they
have
that
distinctly
indian
character,
that
is
what
i
am
saying,
you
cannot...
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
in
this
case,
there
is
virtually
none,
and
i
think
that
is
generally
the
rule
that
the
land
is
generally
held
for
the
indians
themselves.
here
in
the
united
states,
in
the
lands
that
they
have
declared
a
reservation,
is
holding
those
in
trust
for
the
choctaw
indians
and
not
for
anybody
else.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
this
is
all
federal
owned
land.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
yes,
it
would.
i
mean,
checkerboarding
is
an
incident
of
certain
actions
that
congress
takes.
it
is
not
always
the
most
desirable
thing.
it
might
for
simplicity
sake
be
better
to
have
all
the
lands
everywhere
bunched
by
jurisdiction.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
in
this
case,
there
are
indian
lands,
and
then
there
are
lands
that
are
non-indian,
and
the
jurisdiction
varies
between
the
two.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
that
is
correct,
but
i
think
that
is
somewhat
of
a
make
way
argument,
in
the
sense
that
you
had
that
in
rosebud,
you
had
that
in
dakota,
it
is
simply
an
incident
of
some
things
that
congress
does
without
specifically
addressing
or
perhaps
without
caring
about
the
effect
of
checkerboard
jurisdiction.
1151(c)
gives
you
checkerboard
jurisdiction
everywhere
it
applies,
and
congress
passed
that.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
that
is
correct,
harry
smith
john
has
died.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
i
would
believe
it
is,
yes
sir.
thank
you.
