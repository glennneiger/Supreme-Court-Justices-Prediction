mr.
collins,
before
you
do,
can
i
go
back
to
your
last
point
about
the
two
different
groups
of
choctaws
that
remained
behind;
those
which
were
assimilated,
and
those
which
were
not.
you
point
out
those
which
were
not
assimilated
could
not
go
to
school
in
mississippi,
what
about
those
that
were
assimilated?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
they
were
full-blooded
indians,
is
that
the
line
that
mississippi
drew?
because
you
are
relying
in
part
on
the
line
that
mississippi
drew
in
deciding
who
was
eligible
for
public
education.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
are
of
course
concerned
with
several
noncontiguous
areas
too.
if
you
say
this
third
group
is
characteristic
of
all
the
noncontiguous
areas
that
are
now
in
the
reservation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
