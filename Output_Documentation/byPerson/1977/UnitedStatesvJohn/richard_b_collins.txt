mr.
richard
b.
collins
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
our
position
on
the
basic
indian
country
issue
in
the
case
is
the
same
as
the
united
states,
and
i
shall
endeavor
not
to
repeat
mr.
farr’s
arguments
because
we
essentially
agree
with
them.
i
would
like
to
say
a
few
words
in
opening
about
the
people
that
we
are
referring
to
as
the
mississippi
band
of
choctaw
indians,
as
i
think
it
is
relevant
to
this
case.
the
contemplation
of
the
treaty
advancing
rabbit
creek
as
the
state
correctly
points
out
was
that
the
choctaws
would
either
move
to
oklahoma
or
assimilate.
i
think
it
is
important
to
point
out
that
there
are
really
three
groups
of
descendants
from
those
people.
those
that
moved
to
oklahoma
that
obviously
have
no
relevance
to
this
case.
those
that
stayed
in
mississippi,
who
did
assimilate
and
intermarry
with
other
mississippi
citizens,
and
those
who
did
not
assimilate,
who
are
not
all
of
the
descendants,
only
those
who
remained
a
separate
and
distinct
indian
community.
an
indian
community,
most
of
the
members
of
which
were
entirely
of
indian
ancestry,
continued
to
speak
to
choctaw
language,
continued
to
practice
traditional
choctaw
social
customs
and
relations.
in
1918,
when
the
united
states
came
in
and
recognized
that
assimilation
as
to
this
particular
group
had
not
worked,
at
that
time,
your
honors,
the
state
of
mississippi,
and
i
think
in
a
significant
way
recognized
the
distinct
nature
of
this
group
of
people,
because
the
state
of
mississippi
was
then
providing
public
schools
for
white
mississippi
children
and
black
mississippi
children
and
even
chinese
mississippi
children,
but
not
for
this
group
of
indian
people;
they
were
the
only
people
in
mississippi
not
entitled
to
go
to
any
public
schools.
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
restoration
of
the
federal
assistance
to
them
was
this
rather
unique
status
that
they
had
recognized
by
the
state
in
that
manner.
turning
for
a
moment
then
to
the
indian
country
questions
that
have
already
been
discussed,
i
would
like
to
respond
to
a
question
raised
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist
concerning
the
relationship
between
the
indian
country
statute
and
the
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
richard
b.
collins
i
believe
that,
as
i
understand
it,
mr.
justice
stevens,
the
people
who
assimilated
would
join
the
white
community
or
the
black
community
depending
on
which
group
they
had
intermarried
with,
and
they
are
treated
as
members
of
those
communities
today,
essentially.
the
people
who
remained
distinctly
indian
are
the
people
i
am
talking
about.
mr.
richard
b.
collins
well,
your
honor,
as
you
would
suppose,
there
were
occasional
indian
people,
i
am
sure
scattered
throughout
mississippi,
but
the
people
who
maintained
traditional
tribal
relations
were
concentrated
in
one
part
of
mississippi,
around
philadelphia,
and
they
are
the
ones
that
we
are
concerned
with
here.
we
are
not
concerned
with
isolated
individuals
elsewhere;
some
of
whom
may
even
be
of
substantial
indian
ancestry.
the
people
that
remained
in
these
communities
are
largely
full-blood
even
today,
almost
all,
although
the
statutory
definition
under
the
ira
is
half-blood,
and
that
is
the
legal
definition
for
this
band.
mr.
richard
b.
collins
you
are
referring
to
the
land
status
now,
sir?
mr.
richard
b.
collins
the
lands
that
are
trust
lands,
that
were
purchased
for
the
mississippi
choctaws
by
the
government
beginning
in
1918,
are
at
seven
locations
where
the
choctaws
were
largely
concentrated
before
the
land
purchase
program
began.
the
seven
villages
or
communities
are
distinctly
choctaw
communities.
the
population
of
those
communities
is
over
98%
choctaw,
and
those
that
are
not,
are
either
government
employees
or
spouses
of
a
few
choctaws.
the
land
ownership
within
those
communities
is
somewhat
fragmented.
it
was
quite
fragmented
in
1944.
the
government
and
the
tribe
i
believe
have
worked
toward
consolidation
of
the
land,
but
for
example…
mr.
richard
b.
collins
they
have
worked
to
exchange
lands.
i
think
it
is
done
mostly
by
exchange,
mr.
justice
white,
to
exchange
lands
to
make
the
lands
more
contiguous.
that
has
not
entirely
succeeded.
there
is
some
disjunctive
nature
of
the
lands.
however,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
statutes
contemplate
that
in
part
with
the
definition
of
indian
country
in
18
u.s.c.
1151(b),
which
says
dependent
indian
communities
are
indian
country,
and
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
the
martin
case,
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
ruled
that
a
community
very
much
like
these
is
indian
country
under
i
think
rather
similar
circumstances.
also,
we
would
point
out
that
disjointed
land
ownership
has
been
a
feature
of
indian
country
for
many
purposes.
in
the
mcgowan
case,
the
court
sustained
indian
country
status
for
a
piece
of
land
purchased
in
nevada
for
nevada
indians,
and
that
is
my
point
about
the
relationship
between
the
statutes
and
the
court’s
decisions.
the
court
rendered
four
or
five
decisions
defining
indian
country
between
1913
and
1938,
and
it
is
very
clear
from
the
legislative
history
of
the
1948
statute
that
congress
was
codifying
those
decisions.
it
was
recognizing
those
decisions
as
the
law,
and
putting
them
into
the
statute
books.
so
i
think
there
is
a
very
close
relationship
between
the
statutes
and
the
decisions,
which
makes
the
decisions,
even
though
they
are
prior
to
the
statute,
quite
relevant
to
its
meaning.
mr.
richard
b.
collins
no,
your
honor,
in
the
indian
country
statute
of
1948,
the
statute
defining
what
is
indian
country.
mr.
richard
b.
collins
yes,
except
this
statute
was
new
at
that
time.
i
realized
that
most
of
that
48
codification
was
a
codification
of
existing
statutes,
but
there
was
no
existing
indian
country
statute
at
that
time
except
for
an
obscure
portion
of
the
liquor
statutes
which
said
the
allotments
were
indian
country.
other
than
that,
the
only
definition
of
indian
country
in
federal
law
prior
to
1948
was
essentially
the
decisions
of
this
court.
it
was
treated
as
a
common
law
issue,
except
for
this
one
liquor
statute
which
included
allotments.
but
the
definition
of
allotments
in
the
indian
country
statute,
which
again
as
i
emphasized,
codified
prior
decisions
of
this
court.
that
is
18
u.s.c.
1151(c),
obviously
contemplates
some
disjointed
landownership,
and
i
think
congress
has
made
its
decision
that
indian
country
may
so
exist.
the
court
has
almost
explicitly
recognized
that
in
the
decoto
decision
just
a
few
years
ago,
and
therefore
we
do
not
see
that
that
is
any
disability
with
regard
to
the
lands
involved
here
being
indian
country.
in
fact,
the
tract
of
land
recognized
by
the
court
as
indian
country
in
mcgowan
was
i
believe
about
28
acres,
and
the
tract
of
land
on
which
the
crime
we
are
concerned
with
here
occurred
is
over
300
acres.
so
as
far
as
identifying
an
area
as
indian
land,
there
would
be
less
difficulty
in
this
instance.
the
principle
argument
that
the
state
raises
is
that
the
united
states
by
entering
into
the
1830
scheme
irretrievably
lost
its
authority
over
the
choctaw
indians
in
mississippi.
in
response,
we
contend
that
the
actions
of
the
united
states
since
1918
very
clearly
evidenced
an
intent
on
the
part
of
both
congress
and
the
executive
department
to
recognize
again
a
portion
of
the
descendants
of
the
choctaw
people
who
are
involved
in
1830,
as
we
have
already
said.
we
think
that,
that
kind
of
authority
has
been
continuously
and
unanimously
recognized
by
the
court
since
the
beginning
of
the
republic,
until
the
two
cases
below;
they
are
the
first
time
i
can
find
where
the
united
states,
the
political
departments
of
this
government,
have
ever
been
disabled
from
dealing
with
people
who
are
manifestly
american
indians.
mr.
richard
b.
collins
your
honor,
that
is
a
more
difficult
question
of
course.
there
was
a
power,
rather
similar,
exercised
by
the
congress
for
the
period
from
1862
until
1953,
and
that
was
the
prohibition
against
anyone
selling
alcoholic
beverages
to
any
trust
indian,
anywhere
in
the
united
states.
that
was
repeatedly
sustained
by
this
court.
i
do
not
think
we
need
to
reach
questions
that…
mr.
richard
b.
collins
well,
by
trust
indian,
what
i
meant
was
that
statute
said
any
indian
who
is
enrolled
in
an
indian
agency,
that
was
the
definition
in
effect.
mr.
richard
b.
collins
that
goes
beyond
any
question
that
has
ever
been
presented
to
a
court,
and
does
present
a
difficult
problem,
but
i
think
we
are
so
far
from
it
that
i
do
not
think
that
kind
of
situation
really
applies
here
because...
mr.
richard
b.
collins
i
am
quite
uncertain,
your
honor.
i
think
a
fair
argument
can
be
made
that
the
power
is
justified
by
the
constitution
and
that
the
court
should
not
overturn
it.
what
one
might
say
is,
that
sort
of
exercise
of
the
power
would
be
unwise,
but
there
are
many
exercises
of
legislative
and
executive
authority
that
appear
unwise,
but
the
courts
have
no
authority
to
overturn.
i
rather
think
that
would
be
my
opinion
in
answer
to
your
question.
it
would
depend
in
part
on
how
one
defined
indian.
if
you
meant
anyone
descended
from
an
american
indian
tribe,
as
my
client
is,
then
i
would
answer
yes,
the
authority
lies,
and
the
courts
have
no
power
to
overturn
it.
one
of
the
main
reasons
that
we
feel
that
there
is
no
question
about
federal
authority
is
that
the
court
has
consistently
left
this
question
of
recognizing
who
are
indians
under
federal
authority
to
the
political
departments
of
the
government,
and
it
is
absolutely
unprecedented
to
have
the
courts
second
guessing
that
question.
the
government
responsibility
is
based
on
initial
political
relation
with
an
indian
tribe,
but
once
there
is
an
indian
tribe,
as
there
clearly
was
with
the
choctaws,
the
court
has
not
held
and
should
not
hold
that
fragmentation
or
even
termination
of
a
tribe
cannot
be
undone
if
the
government
later
determines
that
the
policy
was
unwise.
the
federal
policy
with
regard
to
indians
has
obviously
often
split
tribes,
fragmented
tribes,
by
war,
conquest,
treaty,
or
otherwise,
and
what
we
contend
has
consistently
been
recognized
by
the
decisions
of
this
and
the
other
federal
courts
is
that
united
states
can
deal
with
the
results
of
those
actions.
where
the
united
states
takes
actions
that
results
in
the
splitting
or
fragmenting
of
a
tribe,
the
united
states
does
not
by
those
actions
lose
its
power
to
deal
with
the
result.
in
fact,
of
course,
the
indian
people
who
are
affected
by
actions
like
that
are
often
those
most
in
need,
as
well
illustrated
by
the
facts
and
the
record
in
this
case.
this
court
sustained
the
constitutionality
of
the
indian
major
crimes
act,
the
statute
that
is
basically
at
issue
here
in
1886,
in
the
decision
of
united
states
against
kagama,
and
in
that
very
decision,
the
court
recognized
i
think
the
principles
that
control
this
case.
the
decision
referred
expressly
to
the
remnants
of
a
race
once
powerful.
the
word
remnants
which
one
might
use
to
describe
the
remnants
of
the
choctaw
tribe
of
mississippi
that
we
are
dealing
with
here
was
used
by
the
court
in
that
opinion.
furthermore,
the
facts
of
that
case
are
rather
similar,
was
a
reservation
established
well
after
california
had
become
a
state
on
lands
that
were
set
aside
after
california
had
become
a
state,
and
if
you
will,
i
suppose
there
was
an
interim
between
1850,
when
california
became
a
state,
and
sometime
after
that
when
the
reservation
was
set
aside
when
those
indians
were
technically
under
state
jurisdiction,
just
as
the
people
we
are
dealing
with
here.
furthermore
in
that
case,
the
court
noted
very
explicitly
that
the
government
is
empowered
to
deal
with
indians
in
part
as
a
result
of
the
consequences
of
conquest
of
the
indians.
the
court
explicitly
noted
that
conquest
has
rendered
the
indians
dependent.
i
believe
the
court
emphasized
that
in
the
recent
decision
in
the
oliphant
case,
that
conquest
rendered
the
indians
dependent
on
the
united
states,
and
that
dependence
was
relied
on
in
the
kagama
decision,
interpreting
this
very
statute
as
giving
the
united
states
authority
to
deal
with
indians
in
the
manner
that
we
are
talking
about
here,
to
provide
a
criminal
code
for
them.
if
the
action
of
1830
were
deemed
irreversible
as
mississippi
contends,
it
would
severely
hamper
federal
policy.
it
would
allow
no
corrective
action.
it
would
cause
problems
elsewhere,
because
that
kind
of
reassertion
of
power
has
occurred
elsewhere,
and
we
contend
that
there
is
no
precedent
for
it.
i
would
next
like
to
point
out
that
when
the
major
crimes
act
jurisdiction
exists,
when
there
is
federal
court
jurisdiction
as
was
exercised
here
by
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
mississippi
to
prosecute
my
client,
when
that
exists,
this
court
and
all
the
other
federal
courts
have
always
held
that,
that
authority
is
exclusive
of
state
authority
over
the
same
crime
that
it
precludes
or
preempts
state
authority
over
the
same
crime.
this
court
has
twice
held
that
as
a
holding;
in
the
seymour
case
and
in
rice
against
olson
which
we
have
cited.
the
lower
federal
courts
have
held
it
in
numerous
circumstances.
the
court
has
noted
it
in
dictum
frequently,
and
most
recently
in
the
antelope
case.
we
can
see
no
reason
why
mississippi
is
any
different
in
this
regard
from
any
other
state
in
the
union.
the
fact
that
the
indians
involved
were
for
a
time
under
state
jurisdiction
does
not
serve
to
distinguish
the
situation
in
other
states.
as
i
have
pointed
out,
there
have
been
frequent
examples
in
the
history
of
the
country
where
indians
were
for
a
time
under
state
authority,
but
federal
jurisdiction
to
establish
a
reservation
was
then
asserted,
and
they
came
under
federal
jurisdiction,
and
that
authority
has
been
sustained
by
the
courts.
in
conclusion,
we
agree
with
the
united
states
that
this
land
was
indian
country.
if
it
is
indian
country,
the
major
crimes
act
on
its
face
applies,
the
federal
court
has
jurisdiction,
and
we
contend
that
the
subsequent
state
prosecution
for
precisely
the
same
offense
was
therefore
preempted
by
valid
federal
authority,
and
that
the
conviction
and/or
judgment
of
conviction
entered
by
the
mississippi
court
should
be
reversed.
mr.
richard
b.
collins
it
is
a
nonprofit
law
firm,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
b.
collins
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
collins
it
is
a
nonprofit
law
firm,
we
are
incorporated
as
a
nonprofit
firm.
mr.
richard
b.
collins
no,
mr.
justice.
it
just
employs
us.
may
i
reserve
my
remaining
time?
mr.
richard
b.
collins
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
three
replies.
first,
in
answer
to
the
last
question
on
schools.
until
1968,
mississippi
choctaw
children
would
attend
bureau
of
indian
affairs
in
mississippi
until
the
eighth
grade,
at
which
time
they
would
go
to
federal
indian
schools
in
oklahoma
to
attend
high
school.
mr.
richard
b.
collins
in
the
part
of
mississippi
in
which
they
are
concentrated,
where
these
schools
exist,
i
think
everyone
has
assumed
that
that
is
the
proper
way
of
things.
i
do
not
think
there
have
been
any
challenges
to
the
system,
so
one
cannot
say
that
if
there
had
been
a
challenge
or
had
been
an
attempt
that
they
might
have
not
been
admitted,
but
i
am
informing
the
court
of
the
way
it
was.
i
cannot
say
precisely
why
it
was.
mr.
richard
b.
collins
your
honor,
we
have
cited
historical
tracts
in
our
brief,
particularly
the
tract
by
mr.
peterson,
that
indicate
that
they,
at
1918
at
least,
they
were
not
admitted
to
mississippi
schools,
and
at
that
time
the
government
established
federal
schools
for
them
for
that
very
reason.
subsequent
to
1918,
all
i
know
is
that…
mr.
richard
b.
collins
no
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
collins
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
if
we
had
a
continuous
pattern
of
federal
relationship
with
these
indians,
the
matter
would
be
precisely
identical.
the
only
point
i
am
making
is
that
there
is
no
doubt.
i
think
the
relevant
point
is
this,
there
is
no
doubt
that
we
have
an
identifiable
group
of
indian
people.
mississippi
treated
them
as
such.
the
government
recognized
them
as
such.
i
think
that
is
the
relevant
point,
and
no
more.
i
was
not
trying
to
make
any
more
of
it
than
that.
mr.
richard
b.
collins
after
1918,
i
do
not
know,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
b.
collins
according
to
the
historical
sources
i
have
read,
they
were
excluded.
why
is
that
so,
i
cannot
say,
we
have
to
look
at
the
statute.
mr.
richard
b.
collins
there
were
no
statutes,
your
honor.
your
honor,
i
would
further
point
out
that
the
court’s
opinion
in
1921
indicated
that
they
were
not
permitted
to
vote,
and
there
was
no
statute
saying
that
they
should
not
be
permitted
to
vote
either.
it
is
the
same
kind
of
situation.
i
am
saying
that
mississippi
treated
them
as
a
separate
group
of
people,
and
we
are
saying
that
there
is
not
an
irrational
exercise
of
federal
authority
with
regards
to
people
who
are
not
identifiable
as
indians;
they
are
identifiable
as
indians,
and
that
is…
mr.
richard
b.
collins
i
agree
as
a
legal
matter,
your
honor,
that
is
absolutely
correct.
the
suggestion
has
been
made,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
federal
authority
is
being
irrationally
exercised
in
some
manner,
and
i
am
suggesting
that
that
is
not
so,
and
that
these
facts
indicate
that
it
is
not
so.
mr.
richard
b.
collins
yes,
well,
that
is
what
i
am
referring
to,
i
agree,
your
honor.
the
next
point
i
wanted
to
refer
to
was
the
indian
reorganization
act
of
1934
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stevens
question.
the
1939
act
of
congress
referring
specifically
to
the
mississippi
choctaws
indicates
specifically
in
its
legislative
history
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
that
the
indian
reorganization
act
was
thought
by
congress
in
1939
to
apply
to
the
mississippi
choctaws,
because
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
one
purpose
of
the
act
was
to
enable
them
to
organize
a
tribal
government
pursuant
to
the
indian
reorganization
act,
so
congress
certainly
thought
that
in
1939.
secondly,
the
…
mr.
richard
b.
collins
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not.
i
mean,
i
know
that
in
fact
they
were
attending
federal
schools,
but
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
furthermore,
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
there
is
a
consistent
pattern
of
administrative
enforcement
of
this
statute
that
indicates
that
it
applies
to
the
mississippi
choctaws,
including
an
opinion
of
assistant
solicitor
felix
cohen,
that
is
included
in
the
government’s
petition.
then
finally,
i
would
mention
that
the
seven
communities
in
which
the
choctaws
live
are
identifiable
in
mississippi
as
choctaw
communities.
no
one
has
suggested
that
people
in
the
area
were
talking
about
do
not
know
which
is
a
choctaw
community
and
which
is
not,
and
in
fact,
they
are
clearly
identifiable
and
known
to
local
citizens.
mr.
richard
b.
collins
as
i
understand
it,
your
honor,
and
this
is
not
in
the
record,
that
over
90%
of
the
lands
in
the
communities
is
federal
land.
there
is
a
bit
of
fee
land
here
and
there,
but
very
little
that
is
enclosed
within
the
communities.
thank
you.
