unknown
speaker
you
are
saying
your
position
with
respect
to
this
reservation
is
different
than
your
position
with
respect
to
the
navajo
reservation?
unknown
speaker
but
on
every
piece
of
this
reservation,
how
many
pieces
are
there?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
many
pieces,
separate
pieces
are
there,
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
many
noncontiguous
tracts
are
there
in
the
reservation?
unknown
speaker
but
there
are
at
least
seven?
unknown
speaker
and
probably
more.
unknown
speaker
you
assert
that
each
one
of
those
must
be
treated
as
a
reservation,
for
all
purposes?
unknown
speaker
mr.
farr,
would
your
position
be
affected
at
all
about
as
to
whether
the
victim
of
the
crime
is
an
indian
or
a
non-indian?
unknown
speaker
how
long
has
the
mississippi
choctaws
been
a
tribe?
unknown
speaker
1945?
unknown
speaker
so
that
was
from
late
1918
to
1945,
it
was
not
providing
aid
to
any
tribe?
unknown
speaker
individual
members
of
a
group?
unknown
speaker
not
to
a
group
as
the
group,
but
to
individual
members
of
that
group?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
you
are
going
to
get
to
--
i
take
it
the
state’s
submission
is,
in
part
at
least,
that
whether
this
is
a
reservation
or
not,
the
united
states
is
not
permitted
to
treat
these
particular
choctaws
as
indians
because
they
were
once
subjected
to
state
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
you
have
referred
a
couple
of
lines
to
the
fact
that
it
is
clear
that
these
lands
fit
within
the
definition
of
indian
country
in
1151.
now,
what
does
that
do
for
you
if
we
accept
that
proposition?
unknown
speaker
if
you
can
surmount
the
other
difficulty
too?
unknown
speaker
this
does
not
go
to
exclusivity
then?
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
have
created
an
indian
reservation
and
then
just
put
non-indians
on
it,
the
federal
courts
would
not
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
for
any
crime?
unknown
speaker
you
hope
it
is.
unknown
speaker
that
is
a
little
circular,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
you
hope
it
is.
ou
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
the
reservation
because
he
is
there
and
living
on
it,
you
have
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
you
say
they
have
jurisdiction
over
smith
john
because
he
is
a
member
of
the
band
and
living
there,
but
still
you
have
to
answer
the
claim
of
the
state,
that
no
matter
if
he
be
as
such,
years
ago
he
was
declared
to
be
not
a
member
of
any
tribe
in…
unknown
speaker
it
is
too
late
now
to
reincorporate
him
into
some
tribe.
unknown
speaker
i
know
you
do
not,
but
that
is
part
of
your
case
too.
unknown
speaker
mr.
farr,
in
mcgowan,
the
federal
government
rather
expressly
did
not
assert
exclusive
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
as
far
as
(inaudible),
federal
government
just
decided
that
there
were
some
underprivileged
people
in
that
community
and
we
just
buy
up
some
federal
land
out
in
arizona
or
someplace
and
move
these
people
onto
the
reservation…
unknown
speaker
so
you
rely
strictly
on
the
indians,
and
what
provision
of
the
constitution
do
you
rest
on,
to
keep
the
state
to
--
on
which
to
ground
federal
power
to
exclude
the
state?
unknown
speaker
would
your
answer
be
any
different
if
the
indians
were
moved
to
colorado
rather
than
arizona?
unknown
speaker
what
about
utah?
what
would
your
answer
be
if
they
gave
new
york
back,
manhattan?
unknown
speaker
the
indians
did
own
manhattan,
did
they
not?
there
are
indians
there
now
--
they
had
a
guy
that
climbed
the
skyscrapers.
unknown
speaker
no,
i
am
talking
about
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
he
could
do
it
in
mississippi
but
he
could
not
do
it
in
new
york.
unknown
speaker
congress
did
not
authorize
that
he
do
it
in
mississippi.
unknown
speaker
what
does
it
depend
on,
blood?
unknown
speaker
well,
just
anyone
cannot
join
the
tribe
and
be
recognized
as
indian.
unknown
speaker
you
better
limit
that
to
mississippi.
unknown
speaker
because
the
former
chief
judge
recorded
criminal
appeals
in
oklahoma,
which
is
a
rather
high
office.
unknown
speaker
are
they
communities
exclusively
indian,
the
so-called
indian
communities
that
you
are
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
i
did
not
ask
you
that,
i
asked
you,
are
they
or
are
they
not
exclusively
indian?
unknown
speaker
a
community
you
are
talking
about
is
an
area.
unknown
speaker
but
there
is
land
in
the
community
that
is
owned
by
other
non-indians?
unknown
speaker
would
your
argument
extend
to
a
checkerboard
situation
such
as
we
have
had
in
the
couple
of
the
reservation
cases?
unknown
speaker
do
we
not
have
a
checkerboard
design
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
your
answer..
unknown
speaker
the
one
individual
petitioner
has
died,
has
he
not?
unknown
speaker
has
the
case
moved
as
to
him
then?
unknown
speaker
they
were
codified
in
the
indian
reorganization
act?
unknown
speaker
well,
was
that
--
at
the
time
the
entire
federal
statute
law
was
codified,
what
is
called
the
1948
revision?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
if
the
executive
branch
and
congress
said
that
we
have
great
sympathy
for
the
plight
of
the
remaining
choctaws
in
mississippi,
and
therefore
wherever
they
may
reside
in
mississippi,
they
shall
be
immune
from
the
mississippi
criminal
code?
unknown
speaker
my
hypothesis
goes
beyond
a
trust
indian.
unknown
speaker
well,
my
hypothesis
goes
beyond
any
indian
who
is
enrolled
in
an
indian
agency
and
simply
says,
anyone
who
can
prove
to
the
satisfaction
of
a
court
trying
the
criminal
case
in
the
state,
that
he
is
of
indian
blood,
shall
have
a
complete
defense
to
the
criminal
charge.
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
an
answer
to
it
one
way
or
the
other?
unknown
speaker
mr.
collins,
could
i
just
ask
you,
i
am
just
curious.
is
the
native
american
rights
fund
a
legal
services
organization,
or
does
it
have
other
functions?
unknown
speaker
so
it
is
a
law
firm.
unknown
speaker
the
professional
organization
under
the
colorado
order?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
not
authorized
to
practice
--
the
firm
is
not
authorized
to
practice
law,
is
it
the
corporation?
unknown
speaker
which
is
it,
five
or
seven?
unknown
speaker
i
have
a
map
here
which
will
show
something.
unknown
speaker
and
living
on
the
reservation?
unknown
speaker
and
the
offense
occurred
there?
unknown
speaker
did
not
the
secretary
of
the
interior
issue
it
and
make
it
a
reservation
in
1944?
unknown
speaker
is
it
still
on
the
books?
unknown
speaker
did
mississippi
ever
protest?
unknown
speaker
mr.
andre,
could
i
interrupt
there,
because
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
relied
so
heavily
on
the
absence
of
any
authority
in
the
1934
act.
why
is
not
section
467
sufficient?
it
says
in
words,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
is
hereby
authorized
to
proclaim
new
indian
reservations
and
lands
acquired,
pursuant
of
any
authority
conferred
by
various
section.
why
did
it
not
do
exactly
that?
unknown
speaker
would
you
agree
that
the
language
of
the
statute
just
read
literally
does
cover
the
situation?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
then
i
just
want
to
know
why
not,
because
i
am
not...
unknown
speaker
which
section
of
the
statute
limits
the
power
in
467
to
new
reservations
for
preexisting
tribes?
what
is
it
in
the
statute
that
supports
your
argument?
neither
side
quoted
those
statute
very
directly.
unknown
speaker
what
you
are
saying
is
the
statute
meant
that
you
could
only
create
a
new
reservation
by
moving
one
from
a
preexisting
location
to
a
new
location,
is
that
basically
what
you
are
saying?
unknown
speaker
but
what
about
in
your
lifetime
in
mississippi,
have
these
choctaws
been
permitted
to
go
to
school,
say
in
the
1940s?
unknown
speaker
probably
not
that
old,
i
would
assume?
unknown
speaker
but
you
just
do
not
know
whether
history
is
the
same
in
1940
--
unknown
speaker
but
at
least
the
state
did
not
attempt
to
establish
its
own
schools
in
these
communities?
unknown
speaker
and
as
far
as
you
know
they
did
not
go
to
either
or
the
other?
unknown
speaker
why
is
that?
by
preference
or
were
they
excluded
from
mississippi
high
schools
unknown
speaker
you
cannot
say
then
that
mississippi
ever
excluded
them
from
mississippi
schools?
unknown
speaker
but
you
have
never
read
a
statute
or
a
rule
or
anything
else
that
ever
banned
them
from
mississippi
schools?
unknown
speaker
so
we
can
judge
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
they
could
have
gone
to
mississippi
schools
if
they
had
wanted
to,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
or
before.
unknown
speaker
your
case
is
as
good
one
way
as
another,
i
take
it,
is
it
not?
whether
they
were
excluded
from
voting
or
going
to
school
or
not,
your
case
is
not
destroyed?
unknown
speaker
but
you
do
not
know
what
their
educational
condition
was
in
1939,
or
whether
they
could
go
to
public
schools
or
not?
unknown
speaker
in
these
communities,
is
there
any
fee
land
at
all?
