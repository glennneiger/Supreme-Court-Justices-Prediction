mr.
carl
f.
andre
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it
important
to
look
first
at
factual
situation
of
mississippi
choctaw
of
today
and
the
land
subject
to
this
case.
it
is
my
understanding
that
today,
something
over
19,000
acres
in
seven
different
counties,
perhaps
five
counties,
this
land
being
neither
continuous
nor
contiguous.
mr.
carl
f.
andre
i
cannot
say,
i
have
not
seen
the
map,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
carl
f.
andre
it
quite
possibly
is
seven,
there
was
some
distinction
there.
i
saw
one
map
on
a
dissertation
which
showed
i
think
five,
and
another
map
which
showed
seven
counties,
i
do
to
know.
it
is
curious,
looking
at
this,
this
land
purchased
out
at
about
1918,
it
was
authorized
in
1918,
began
in
the
early
1920s,
and
each
year
a
little
land
was
purchased.
by
1930,
something
like
3,000
acres
had
been
purchased.
by
1960,
some
16,000
acres
may
have
been
purchased.
today
it
is
something
over
19,000
acres.
the
particular
indictment
narrows
a
spot
where
this
crime
took
place,
probably
took
place,
to
880
yards
squared,
according
to
the
reckoning
of
the
fifth
circuit.
this
land
as
i
said
is
neither
continuous
nor
contiguous,
it
is
(inaudible).
i
understand
that
there
are
some
12,000
acres
of
it,
exclusively
devoted
to
timber.
now,
as
to
the
choctaw
people,
they
are
not
gathered
together
in
one
community.
there
are
smaller
communities
scattered
about
as
part
of
that
area,
and
not
necessarily
touching
each
other,
but
they
are
choctaw
citizens
of
mississippi
in
some
56
of
our
82
counties.
there
are
some
living
in
western
tennessee,
in
the
memphis
area.
there
are
others
who
are
living
in
louisiana
and
alabama.
some
have
no
affiliation
with
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
office
there.
some
are
called
in
rural
choctaws,
but
not
necessarily
all
of
them
are.
some
have
participated
in
the
various
activities
of
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
but
not
all
have.
as
i
have
said,
they
number
some
3,000
to
4,000,
i
cannot
say
how
many.
i
do
not
know
where
they
all
live.
these
are
guesses.
mr.
carl
f.
andre
possibly
so,
i
may
intend
that
none
of
them
are,
under
the
basis
of
this
case
before
the
court.
mr.
carl
f.
andre
yes.
mr.
carl
f.
andre
they
are
choctaw
indians
who
were
in
mississippi,
yes.
mr.
carl
f.
andre
i
think
they
were
living
on
the
land
alleged
to
be
a
reservation.
mr.
carl
f.
andre
yes,
no
question
on
that.
but
terms
had
been
banded
about
in
the
case
at
all
levels,
such
as
reservation,
tribe,
wards,
guardianship,
and
so
forth,
which
i
think
we
need
to
look
at
a
little
bit
more
closely.
it
has
been
alleged,
as
i
understand
it
by
the
government
possession,
and
by
john
in
this
case,
that
the
federal
government
acknowledges
that
they
had
no
jurisdiction
over
mississippi
choctaws,
they
exercised
it
not,
from
around
1830
to
19,
when,
when
did
they
start
reasserting
or
asserting
in
the
jurisdiction,
the
record
is
not
clear.
certainly
they
are
doing
it
by
1975
in
this
case,
they
are
asserting
jurisdiction
over
them.
but
if
they
did
so…
mr.
carl
f.
andre
that
is
what
his
proclamation
said;
our
position
here
said
it
was
grounded
and
improper
legislation.
mr.
carl
f.
andre
yes
sir,
i
suppose
it
is.
he
based
that
proclamation,
if
i
could
continue
along
that
line,
on
the
1939
act
of
congress,
which
simply
said,
an
act
to
define
the
status
of
land
purchased
for
the
benefit
of
choctaws
in
mississippi.
this
was
to
clarify
the
title.
mr.
carl
f.
andre
no
sir,
no
one
paid
any
attention,
until
of
recent
years.
so
today
we
are
faced
with
some
19,000
acres
across
the
state,
no
clear
pattern
as
to
when
and
where
this
land
is
bought,
nor
how
this
land
is
to
be
used;
some
of
it
being
set
aside
for
timber.
presumably
some
of
it
as
as
rare
statistics.
i
do
not
know
whether
or
not
any
non-indians
live
on
it.
i
do
know
that
all
of
the
indians
do
not
live
on
this
land,
they
live
elsewhere.
that
the
federal
government
is
asserting
a
possession,
to
my
mind
not
unlike
a
proposition
if
they
came
into
southern
louisiana
and
decided
to
take
jurisdiction
of
the
cajuns
of
that
area,
who
spoke
french,
and
had
been
speaking
french,
who
lived
in
relative
close
proximity
to
each
other,
solely
because
they
were
cajuns
of
french
descent,
because
congress
feels…
mr.
carl
f.
andre
well,
this
land
has
been
purchased
as
we
have
maintained
in
a
peculiar
transform
situation.
it
is
held
in
trust
for
the
choctaws.
but
i
think
it
really
could
be
argued
that
if
that
is
permissible,
then
congress
could
authorize
(inaudible)
to
buy
land
for
the
cajuns.
mr.
carl
f.
andre
that
is
true.
mr.
carl
f.
andre
that
is
true
because,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
we
state
that
congress
deals
with
indian
tribes,
and
that
there
must
be
this
tribal
consideration
which
goes
down
through
history,
and
we
start
off
and
look
at
treaties
with
the
choctaws
from
1798,
the
choctaw
tribe.
we
look
at
the
indian
removal
act,
just
prior
to
the
treaty
of
dancing
rabbit
creek
in
1830,
a
removal
of
choctaw
tribes,
the
indian
tribes
to
the
west.
mr.
carl
f.
andre
yes,
yes.
mr.
carl
f.
andre
simply
because
to
do
it
otherwise
you
are
getting
into
racial
law,
which
to
my
understanding
is
not
permissible.
mr.
carl
f.
andre
perhaps
it
could
be
done
on
certain
situations,
and
it
might
be
reorganized
on
a
bilateral
basis
between
--
if
a
group
of
indian
descendants
got
together
and
attempted
to
organize,
and
then
petition
the
congress
for
some
sort
of
corporation
or
some
corporate
status
or
something
like
that,
then
it
could
possibly
evolve
into
a
situation.
but
to
purely
and
simply
take
a
group
of
people
or
the
descendants
of
people
who
had
become
citizens
of
a
state
and
were
treated
as
other
citizens
of
the
state
for
almost
100
years,
as
individuals,
and
then
to
set
them
up
as
a
new
tribe,
which
in
fact
it
was,
because
there
was
no
organization
to
these
people
there
in
mississippi
until
about
1934
or
1935.
then
there
were
two
conflicting
organizations
which
were
(inaudible)
authorities;
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
favored
one,
breathe
life
into
them,
and
it
followed
with
the
proclamation
of
the
secretary
of
interior
in
1944.
mr.
carl
f.
andre
but
there
must
be
some
legislative
cement
to
hold
the
argument
together,
your
honor,
and
that
is
missing
in
this
case,
for
this
reason.
if
they
are
relying
on
the
indian
reorganization
act
of
1934,
it
addresses
itself
to
tribal
reorganization,
and
other
matters,
and
states
such
things
as
a
majority
of
the
tribe
may
agree
to
come
under
this.
there
was
no
list
that
i
can
find
of
any
particular
choctaw
tribe
in
mississippi
at
that
time.
these
were
individuals
living
(inaudible)
as
we
have
said.
what
is
the
majority
of
a
number
that
today
ranges
between
three
and
5,000
people?
it
is
an
indefinite,
impossible
situation.
then
we
find
another
peculiarity.
the
relief
act
of
1918
which
congress
--
first
time
as
far
as
i
know
that
congress
had
recognized
any
indians
in
mississippi
directly
since
1830,
provided
for
certain
relief
and
the
purchase
of
land
to
be
sold
to
the
choctaws
on
a
repayable
basis.
this
is
where
the
land
purchase
started,
because
the
choctaws
took
the
land,
but
did
not
pay
for
it,
and
the
government
represents.
this
in
turn
produced
the
1939
act
to
clarify
the
land
title,
as
to
who
should
have
title
to
the
land.
so
in
the
1934,
it
is
to
me
an
impossible
situation
to
suggest
that
a
group
of
people
across
a
state
could
satisfy
the
basic
requirements
of
coming
together
in
an
organization
function,
getting
majority
out
of
them
to
approve
at
a
proper
election,
etcetera.
now,
what
i
was
going
to
say
was
that
the
1918
act
addressed
itself
to
whole
blood
choctaws.
the
indian
reorganization
act
addressed
itself
to
half-blood
choctaws.
the
record
is
devoid
of
any
anthropological
study
or
otherwise
to
determine
who
was
a
whole
blood
and
who
was
a
half-
blood.
presumably,
they
had
something
to
go
on
because
some
ten
years
before
1918,
acting
under
the
dawes
commission
authority,
agents
had
gone
into
mississippi
and
attempted
to
round
up
and
get
together
various
people
of
choctaw
descent,
so
that
they
could
join
the
tribe
in
oklahoma.
that
is
where
the
tribe
and
the
tribal
authority
that
congress
dealt
with
had
been
since
1830
removal
from
mississippi.
congress
has
not
created
any
tribal
status
for
mississippi
choctaws.
the
act
that
the
secretary
of
interior
relied
on,
did
not
address
itself
to
mississippi
choctaws.
this
court
reviewed
in
past
statutes
of
mississippi
choctaws
in
1921,
in
winton
vs.
amos,
vested
in
length
the
whole
history
of
the
tribe.
it
is
no
point
in
repeating
all
of
that
today,
but
sufficient
to
say
they
were
absent
in
a
congressional
direct
action
from
1830
until
1918.
mr.
carl
f.
andre
i
think
your
honor
that
you
have
to
address
yourself
to
the
overall
purpose
of
the
indian
reorganization
act,
which
was
to
reorganize
tribes,
and
possibly
get
them
out
from
under
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
or
at
least
the
domination
of
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
mr.
carl
f.
andre
cover
our
situation?
mr.
carl
f.
andre
no
sir,
i
do
not
think
it
covers
our
situation.
mr.
carl
f.
andre
because
i
think
we
do
not
have
a
tribe
in
mississippi
in
1934
subject
to
that
act
which
says,
that
any
tribe
on
the
reservation
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
government.
we
had
no
tribe
in
mississippi.
there
was
no
reservation.
the
choctaws
there
were
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state,
and
they
had
been
since
1830.
mr.
carl
f.
andre
in
front
of
me
but
the
statute.
the
indian
reorganization
act,
according
to
the
authorities
and
all
general
articles,
etcetera,
coins
the
handbook
of
indian
law
and
others,
state
that
the
purpose
of
the
indian
reorganization
act
was
to
--
it
had
several
purposes.
one
to
stop
the
practice
of
indian
land
allotments,
where
indians
were
allotted
land
individually
and
subsequently
lost.
to
permit
the
tribes
to
come
out
from
under
the
domination
or
complete
control
of
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
and
act
independently
in
their
own
affairs,
and
therefore
it
directs
itself
to
at
least
the
nucleus
of
some
tribe,
something
that
can
be
said
to
be
a
tribe.
also,
if
i
am
not
mistaken,
refers
to
tribes
on
an
indian
reservation.
there
were
many
reservations
at
that
time,
all
over,
the
tribal
organization,
the
various
indians
on
them
varied;
in
some
place
it
was
highly
organized,
in
some
place
it
was
not.
mr.
carl
f.
andre
i
suspect
that,
that
was
put
in
to
buy
additional
lands
in
such
places
as
oklahoma
and
in
the
west,
i
suspect
that,
i
cannot
say.
as
cohen
states
that
the
indian
reorganization
act
as
finally
put
together
was
sort
of
a
compromise
between
the
senate
and
the
house,
then
you
have
to
be
a
little
weary
in
making
any
positive
statement
about
it
at
all.
i
think
one
more
point
is
necessary.
we
have
talked
here
this
morning
about
wardship,
guardianship
over
indians.
the
choctaw
indians
of
mississippi,
they
have
been
in
close
proximity
to
the
european
settlers
in
there
from
1699
forward.
at
the
time
of
the
treaty
of
dancing
rabbit
creek,
they
were
not
an
untutored
group
of
people.
they
are
not
today.
true,
their
fortunes
are
mixed,
just
to
those
fortunes
of
black
americans,
white
americans,
chinese
americans,
others
in
mississippi
have
mixed
economic
and
educational
fortunes.
mr.
carl
f.
andre
the
reference
there
was
in
1918.
i
would
suggest
that
in
the
areas
in
which
choctaws
lived
in
mississippi,
there
may
not
have
been
any
schools
in
the
early
part
of
1900s.
mr.
carl
f.
andre
i
do
not
know
if
that
is
so.
mr.
carl
f.
andre
that
is
said.
mr.
carl
f.
andre
i
cannot
answer
that,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
carl
f.
andre
i
am
that
old,
but
i
do
not
know,
i
was
raised
in
the
section
of
the
state
where
not
many
choctaws
lived.
mr.
carl
f.
andre
i
do
not
know.
i
think
they
could
possibly
go
to
the
schools.
i
do
not
know
if
they
was
any
prohibition
against
them,
but
there
had
been
some
schools
set
for
them
at
that
time,
which
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
set
them
on
into
other
schools,
boarding
schools.
i
think
it
is
through
other
reason
that
they
have
set
up
that
special
schools,
and
you
get
into
dissertations
and
learning
articles
on
this,
and
you
find
remarks
like
the
choctaws
did
not
want
to
go
to
school.
mr.
carl
f.
andre
no.
mr.
carl
f.
andre
i
do
not
think
there
were
any
state
schools
set
up
separate
for
choctaws.
one
time
we
had
schools
for
blacks
and
schools
for
whites,
i
do
not
think
they
were
set
up
for
choctaws.
mr.
carl
f.
andre
i
do
not
know,
i
just
cannot
answer.
i
just
do
not
know
what
happened
in
the
40s,
50s,
and
so
forth.
in
conclusion,
we
simply
say
that
these
are
citizens
of
mississippi,
have
been
since
1830,
that
in
truth
the
position
of
the
government
attempts
to
apply
acts
of
the
department
of
interior
retroactively
to
take
a
proclamation
of
1944
and
say,
oh,
this
is
based
on
a
39
act,
which
is
based
on
a
34
act,
which
is
based
on
the
1918
act,
and
therefore
you
have
changed
the
character,
when
the
historical
truth
does
not
support
this
position.
thank
you.
