we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
john
against
mississippi
and
united
states
against
john.
mr.
farr,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
have,
as
has
been
suggested
by
brother
white,
at
least
two
issues
here.
first
of
all,
whether
or
not
there
is
territorial
--
well,
at
least
two
issues,
probably
three
or
four
or
five,
whether
or
not
there
is
territorial
jurisdiction.
second,
if
so,
is
that
exclusive.
thirdly,
even
though
there
be
territorial
jurisdiction,
can
there
be
federal
jurisdiction
over
these
people
who
were
years
ago
made
non-tribal
members
and
citizens
of
theâ€¦
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
all
federal
land
is
it
not,
federal
owned
land.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
collins.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
andre?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
is
it
not
possible
that
some
maybe
subject
to
federal
jurisdiction
and
some
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
leaving
out
one
element
there,
are
you
not,
and
that
ism
the
land,
the
reservation
aspect?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
are
assuming
that
once
a
tribe
disintegrates
that
it
can
never
be
restored
to
tribal
status?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
your
authority
for
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
not
given
us
any
authority
for
this
idea
that
a
tribe
may
not
restore
its
self
to
tribal
status,
assuming
that
the
federal
authority
takes
the
appropriate
steps
which
they
claim
to
have
taken.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
have
you
not
almost
described
the
restoration
of
a
disintegrated
tribe
by
what
you
have
just
said?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
may
not
have
been
untutored,
but
they
were
unschooled,
they
were
not
allowed
to
go
to
school,
were
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
they
were
public
schools,
they
were
not
allowed
to
go
to
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
according
to
an
opinion
in
this
court.
i
do
not
know,
i
only
--
i
only
know
what
i
read.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
is
true
about
a
lot
of
children,
it
is
nothing
unusual?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
collins?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
they
were
excluded
from
schools
and
excluded
from
voting,
it
would
lend
some
support
to
your
argument
that
they
were
isolated
into
their
tribal
groups?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgments
and
opinions
of
the
court
in
united
states
against
john
and
the
related
case,
john
against
mississippi
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
blackmun.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
