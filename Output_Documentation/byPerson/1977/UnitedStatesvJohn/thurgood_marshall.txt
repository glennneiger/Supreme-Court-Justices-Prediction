marshall
you
said
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
this
was
in
1944,
was
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
not
they
kind
of
late?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah.
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
over
the
west.
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
is
a
great
bunch
of
choctaws
in
oklahoma.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
are
not
these
two
particular
individuals,
choctaw
indians
living
in
mississippi?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
those
are
the
two
we
are
talking
about?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
is
a
street
in
phoenix
named
indian
school
road,
and
the
reason
its
named
indian
school
road
is
that
there
was
a
federal
indian
school
from
which
indians
from
wide
ranging
areas
were
sent
by
the
federal
government
at
their
choice,
subject
to
my
colleague
stewartâ€™s
remarks,
that
maybe
no
child
chooses
to
go
to
school,
but
the
issue
really
never
arose
whether
they
could
have
gone
to
school
in
apache
county
or
navajo
county,
since
they
all
went
to
the
federal
indian
school
in
phoenix.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
you
want
to
look
at
the
mississippi
statutes
back
in
those
days.
