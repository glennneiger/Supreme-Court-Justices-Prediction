mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
that
i
present
to
the
court
today
is
whether
or
not
an
individual
can
be
charged,
convicted
and
sentenced
under
the
aggravated
bank
robbery
statute
18,
2113
(d)
and
additionally
charged,
convicted
and
sentenced
under
924
(c)(1)
for
using
a
firearm
during
the
commission
of
the
felony.
the
tenure
of
our
argument
has
changed
somewhat
from
a
double
jeopardy
question
to
a
question
of
multiplicity
or
duplicity,
but
i
still
think
that
the
dictates
of
the
blockburger
case
are
applicable
in
that
you
we
must
show
that
each
offense
requires
proof
of
an
element
that
the
other
does
not
and
it
has
been
our
contention
since
the
inception
of
this
case
that
in
order
to
sustain
a
conviction
under
924
(c)(1)
that
all
of
the
elements
under
2113
(d)
must
be
proven.
now,
the
fourth
and
fifth
circuit,
and
the
sixth
circuit
in
following
the
fourth
and
the
fifth
circuit
in
their
opinion
in
the
lower
court
stated
that
they
thought
there
was
a
difference
in
proof
of
the
elements
and
they
base
their
decision
on
the
language
contained
in
2113
wherein
the
government
is
required
to
prove
that
an
individual's
life
was
endangered
by
the
use
of
a
dangerous
weapon
or
device
and
that
a
dangerous
weapon
or
device
was
not
always
a
firearm
and
it
is
my
contention
that
in
getting
to
the
elements
in
2113
(d)
that
you
have
to
prove
every
single
one
of
them
to
prove
that
the
felony
in
924
(c)
was
committed
and
that
you
cannot
sit
back
and
judge
the
facts
of
each
case
in
a
vacuum.
you
have
to
look
at
the
weapon
that
was
used,
and
when
a
firearm
or
a
handgun
is
used,
it
fits
both
in
2113
(d)
and
924
(c).
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
no,
i
think
the
test
is
set
down
in
blockburger,
is
that
you
compare
the
statutes.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
that
is
correct,
but
i
do
say
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
factual
elements
in
fifth
amendment
of
the
statute.
you
have
to
draw
the
statutes
sufficiently
broad
to
encompass
all
the
factual
situations
that
may
occur,
but
i
do
not
think
that
in
viewing
924
(c)
as
opposed
to
2113
(d),
you
can
just
say,
suppose
something
else
was
used.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
i
believe
that,
that
interpretation
can
be
used
and
should
be
used
in
a
case
where
the
facts
do
not
really
fit
in
either
one
of
them.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
exactly
my
position.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
well,
then
i
do
not
think
you
could
prosecute
under
924
(c)
because
that
specifically
has
to
be
a
firearm.
i
do
think
that
the
legislators
in
drafting
2113
(d)
had
to
have
thought
that
the
most
common
weapon
or
dangerous
weapon
or
device
to
be
used
would
be
a
handgun,
or
firearm,
or
rifle,
or
shotgun,
something
that
would
be
encompassed
by
924
(c).
i
think
that
we
see
it
on
tv
and
we
read
about
it
occasionally
that
other
weapons
are
used
to
rob
banks
and
usually
they
are
more
dangerous
than
a
firearm.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
that
is
exactly
my
point.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
well,
i
think
--
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
is
duplicities
or
multiplicities.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
that
they
are
charging
two
distinct
crimes
out
of
the
same
offense.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
i
think
i
stated
it
simply
to
the
district
court
and
again
in
same
scenario
that
they
have
charged
the
petitioners
here
with
robbing
a
bank
using
a
gun,
and
using
a
gun
to
rob
a
bank,
and
i
think
that
is
duplicitous.
i
think
you
can
adopt
the
lesser
included
offense
arguments
and
saying
that
the
elements
in
manslaughter
are
the
same
as
murder,
but
you
ought
to
be
required
to
go
one
way
with
the
other.
i
think
in
looking
at
the
legislative
history,
united
states
has
said
that
you
should
not
put
much
weight
on
representative
poff's
comments,
he
was
the
sponsor
of
the
924
(c)
amendment
and
i
guess
my
case
rests
on
the
part
of
his
comments
in
legislative
history
wherein
he
says,
it
should
be
noted
for
legislative
history
that
my
amendment
is
not
to
apply
and
he
named
several
additional
statutes
in
addition
to
the
2113
(d)
statute.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
i
believe
its
during
the
floor
debates.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
and
there
was
as
pointed
out
in
counsel
for
the
government's
brief
and
abrupt
cessation
of
talking
about
that
amendment
or
that
part
of
it.
they
just
want
to
write
on
to
another
part
of
it.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
i
do
not
believe
if
there
is.
i
believe
that
congress
provided
the
enhanced
penalty
under
2113
(d)
if
any
sort
of
weapon,
dangerous
weapon
or
device
was
used
and
endangered
anybody's
life
and
i
think
that
924
(c)
was
enacted
in
response
to
the
growing
concern
for
the
use
of
firearm
specifically
in
committing
crimes
and
i
have
to
agree
with
representative
poff's
comments
that
it
was
not
intended
to
be
used
in
cases
where
there
was
already
an
enhanced
punishment
provided.
since
the
time
of
submission
of
our
briefs,
i
was
sent
a
copy
of
letter
written
from
the
department
of
justice
to
united
states
attorney
in
maryland
mr.
i
believe
it
is
beal
(ph)
wherein
the
department
of
justice
said,
“it
was
their
policy
not
to
prosecute
on
the
924
(c)
charge
when
the
defensible
offense
was
a
2113
(d)
charge”
and
they
cited
the
general
principle
of
law
that
when
a
specific
statute
and
a
general
statute
are
involved
in
the
same
set
of
facts
that
the
general
statute
should
be
used,
and
additionally
they
cited
representative
poff's
comments.
now,
i
think
that
the
legislative
history
in
enacting
these
statutes
should
be
considered
in
cases
where
the
statement
that
congress'
best
means
what
it
says
has
to
be
looked
at
when
you
cannot
really
determine
what
congress
says.
in
a
case
of
this
nature
where
the
government
is
arguing
that
they
do
not
mean
what
they
say
and
that
you
should
not
listen
to
representative
poff's
comments
and
the
fact
that
you
do
have
what
on
its
face
is
a
conflict,
that
this
court
has
to
use
the
tools
that
are
available
to
it
to
determine
exactly
what
they
did
mean
and
as
i
have
stated
before
i
think
that
they
have
created
an
absurdity
and
they
could
carry
it
one
step
father
by
saying
that
whoever
uses
a
saturday
night
special
which
costs
less
than
$50,
shall
be
guilty
of
an
additional
offense
and
i
think
that
would
follow
in
line
with
the
logic
that
has
been
used
in
allowing
a
924
(c)
charge
to
be
tacked
on
to
a
2113
(d)
charge
and
basically
i
rest
my
case
on
representative
poff's
comments
and
the
absurdity
that
is
committed
when
you
let
a
person
be
charged
with
robbing
a
bank
using
a
gun,
and
using
a
gun
to
rob
a
bank.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
well,
that
was
the
case
i
believe
in
the
crew
case
where
the
fourth
circuit
said
that
that
was
perfectly
acceptable.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
no,
your
honor
i
do
not.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
your
honor
and
i
think
that
is
conditioned
on
using
the
gun,
it
says
“by
the
use
of
a
dangerous
weapon
or
device”
and
i
think
that
when
you
use
a
dangerous
weapon
or
device,
you
automatically
put
somebody's
life
in
danger.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
the
two
charge?
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
well,
that
if
you
--
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
i
can
see
the
circumstance
where
it
would
be
safe
in
your
pocket,
then
i
do
not
think
they
could
charge
him
under
2113
(d)
and
i
think
there
is
a
further
fact
in
this
case
is
that
the
indictment
itself
specify
that
the
dangerous
weapon
or
device
was
a
handgun
under
the
2113
(d)
charge
and
then
specified
that
the
firearm
was
a
handgun
under
the
924
(c)
charge
and
so
that
they
moved
any
possible
distinction
or
difference
between
the
two
in
each
statute.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
i
say
that
i
rely
heavily
--
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
i
do
rely
heavily
on
it
and
we
were
not
aware
of
congressman
poff's
comments
until
the
decision
in
the
eagle
case
came
down,
and
--
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
our
argument
that
it
is
duplicities
and
possibly
places
a
person
in
double
jeopardy,
but
trying
him
twice
for
the
same
offense
at
the
same
time.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
i
think
it
is
--
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
it
is
all
our
force
with
this
case.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
make
one
final
comment
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
comments
and
i
think
that
anytime
a
firearm
is
used
to
commit
a
bank
robbery
that
you
automatically
have
the
conditions
of
924
(c)(1)
and
2113
(d)
satisfied,
but
that
anytime
a
weapon
other
than
a
firearm
is
used
you
cannot
get
a
conviction
under
924
(c)(1)
and
i
would
be
most
happy
to
make
copies
of
the
united
states
department
of
justice's
letter
wherein
they
have
referred
to
united
state's
attorney
bulletin
519,
number
3,
february
05,
1971,
available
to
mr.
farr.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
the
date
of
the
letter
is
january
13,
1972,
and
refers
to
the
united
states
--
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
well
--
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
i
received
this
letter
through
my
co-counsel
in
lexington
and
the
letter
itself
refers
to
united
states
attorney
bulletin
519,
number
3,
february.
i
have
just
received
this
last
week
before
coming
up
here.
mr.
robert
w.
willmott,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
thank
you.
