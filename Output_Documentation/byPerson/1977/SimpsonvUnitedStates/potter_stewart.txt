justice
potter
stewart
well,
your
submission
is
as
i
understood
it
that
whenever
the
weapon
is
a
firearm
then
these
charges
are
necessarily
duplicities?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
is
only
when
the
firearms
involved
that
this
question
could
ever
arise
because
that
is
the
only
time
that
924
(c)
is
involved?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
your
point,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
in
delinquency
united
states
case
is
like
that.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
farr
can
i
interrupt,
supposing
a
man
was
indicted
for
violating
924
(c)(2)
carrying
a
firearm,
could
he
for
the
same
transaction
also
be
indicted
for
violating
924
(c)(1)?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
would
you
think
that
decision
is
right?
justice
potter
stewart
but
don't
those
two
sections
have
an
element,
the
other
does
not?
one,
he
has
to
carry
it
and
other
he
has
to
use
it
and
i
suppose
you
could
use
it
without
carrying
it?
if
you
give
someone
else
orders
to
shoot
or
something
like
that?
justice
potter
stewart
but
what
other
than
the
lateral
language
of
the
statute,
i
mean,
then
you
are
not
relying
on
the
lateral
language,
what
evidence
is
that
the
congress
intended
to
get
a
2113
(d)?
justice
potter
stewart
what
about
this
communication
we
were
told
about
from
the
justice
department
to
the
us
attorney?
justice
potter
stewart
have
you
been
supplied
with
a
copy
of
it?
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
member
of
the
court,
you
have
been
supplied
with
copies
of
it?
justice
potter
stewart
as
soon
when
counsel
referred
to
that
that
it
was
something
that
had
been
made
available,
if
not,
it
certainly
should
be
if
any
reliance
is
placed
on
it?
justice
potter
stewart
you
might
be
interested
in
seeing
if
it,
or
either
seeing
it
or
having
forget
that
there
is
no
such
thing?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
will
make
it
available?
