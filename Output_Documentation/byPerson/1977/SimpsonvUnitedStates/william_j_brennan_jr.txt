justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
petitioners
in
this
case
were
convicted
of
committing
a
bank
robbery
with
firearms.
and
in
consequence
they
were
given
enhanced
sentences
under
statute
that
provides
for
enhanced
sentences
for
bank
robberies
i
quote
the
statute
"by
the
use
of
a
dangerous
weapon
or
device.‚Äù
but
there
is
another
statute
that
provides
generally
that
it
is
a
crime
to
use
a
firearms
to
commit
any
felony
prosecutable
in
a
court
of
the
united
states.
the
petitioners
at
the
same
trial
were
also
convicted
and
sentenced
to
consecutive
sentences
under
that
statute.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
affirmed
the
conviction,
but
we
reverse.
we
hold
that
in
a
prosecution
going
out
of
a
single
bank
robbery
with
firearms
and
accused
may
not
be
sentenced
under
both
the
enhancement
provision
of
the
bank
robbery
statute
and
under
the
firearm
statute.
mr.
justice
rehnquist

has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
