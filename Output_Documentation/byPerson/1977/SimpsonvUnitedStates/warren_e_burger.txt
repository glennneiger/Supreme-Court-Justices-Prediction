if,

chief

e.
burger
is
there
any
kind
of
a
weapon
or
any
kind
of
a
dangerous
device
that
could
be
used
in
your
view
that
would
be
sustainable
with
convictions
under
both
sections
as
you
have
here.
that
is,
you
are
arguing
that
when
it
is
a
firearm
or
pistol
for
example,
they
cannot
be
two.
is
there
any
kind
of
a
weapon
or
device
that
would
warrant
the
conviction
under
both
sections?

what
other
purpose

except

make
people
believe
that
their
lives
are
in
jeopardy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
asked
you
about
using
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
does
not
he
use
it
when
he
carries
it
in
his
hand,
walking
in
the
bank,
is
he
not
using
it
for
the
bank
robbery?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
does
not
have
to
pull
the
trigger
-
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
how
could
he
carry
it
without
using
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
it
mean
to
imply
that
if
he
had
a
license
for
the
firearm,
that
would
give
him
some
immunity
nothing
under
that
one
section?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
what
mr.
justice
white
suggests,
if
he
is
carrying
a
gun
in
a
bank
in
the
course
of
a
bank
robbery,
does
not
the
unlawful
aspect
change
everything?
chief

warren
e.
burger
a
blockburger
case
was
not
double
jeopardy
case,
was
it?

been
used
in
subsequent
double
jeopardy

chief

e.

do
you

anything
further
mr.

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
make
it
available
to
your
friend
and
he
will
see
it
to
it
that
we
get
that
and
anything
that
may
occur
directly
on
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
the
reason
for
my
suggesting
you
give
it
to
mr.
farr
because
there
may
be
other
methods
that
relate
to
it
and
to
explain
it.
