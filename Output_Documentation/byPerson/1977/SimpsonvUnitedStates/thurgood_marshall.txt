justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
any
place
to
show
how
many
bank
robberies
are
made
with
non
lethal
weapons?
justice
thurgood
marshall
have
you
ever
heard
of
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
non
lethal
--
not
those
mentioned
in
this
statute,
pin
it
down?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
does
that
cut
the
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
that
help
or
hurt
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
fact
the
congress
meant
to
put
an
additional
penalty
on
robberies
that
were
normally
going
on?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
could
have
just
changed
the
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
if
they
wanted
to
put
it
on
the
bank
robbery,
they
could
have
raised
it,
could
they
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
term
of
bank
robbery?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
i
suggest
that
can
he
as
“is
not
awkward,”
this
is
more
than
an
awkward
result,
this
is
10
years
of
the
man's
life?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
the
argument
that
had
made
that
congress
could
now
pay
us
one
and
said
if
you
use
an
automatic,
it's
a
third
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
goes
on
and
on.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
it
was
an
automatic?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
suppose
as
it
is
in
working
condition,
it
says
the
gun
that
is
in
working
condition?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
suppose
it
says
that
the
person
assumed
it
was
loaded?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
people
in
the
bank?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
as
for
me
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
i
am
trying
to
tell
you
that
i
want
to
spin
with
the
first
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
am
i
trying
to
exercise
is
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
in
this
one
it
is
identical.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
did
not
show
that
there
was
an
increase
in
bank
robberies
with
guns?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
what
we
are
talking
about?
