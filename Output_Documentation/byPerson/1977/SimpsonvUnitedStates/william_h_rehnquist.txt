justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
when
you
say
the
blockburger
test
is
not
one
where
you
compare
the
statute,
but
where
you
simply
compare
the
evidence
in
each
particular
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
i
do
not
see
how
you
can
advance
the
proposition
that
you
compare
the
weapon
involved
in
each
particular
case
because
here
clearly
a
dangerous
weapon
or
a
device
includes
other
things
than
a
firearm?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
it
is
a
case
by
case,
exhibit
by
exhibit
test
so
far
as
your
concern?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
my
brother
stewart
asked
you
a
question
a
moment
ago
which
i
am
sure
he
knew
the
meaning
of
it
and
which
you
doubtless
know
the
meaning
of
it,
which
i
think
i
did
not
understand
the
meaning
of
one
of
the
words
and
that
is
that
the
indictment
is
necessarily
duplicities
this.
what
does
that
mean?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you
know
(voice
overlap)
i
think
may
be
i
used
the
wrong
word?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
does
that
mean?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
is
the
objection
to
that,
blockburger?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
any
other
objections?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
was
that
statement
by
representative
poff
made
to
constitute,
do
you
know
it
was
on
the
floor
--?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
during
the
floor
debate?
