unknown
speaker
what
the
indictment
had
been
on
the,
that
this
what
924
(c)(1)?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
indictment
under
(c)(2)?
unknown
speaker
and
do
you
agree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
because
under
the
2113
you
have
to
put
someone's
life
in
jeopardy?
unknown
speaker
well,
when
you
have
924
(c)
it
says
carries
a
firearm?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
have
to
use
it
when
you
are
robbing
the
bank?
unknown
speaker
mr.
willmott
do
i
understand
from
your
comment
before
my
brother
white's
question
that
absent
congressman
poff's
comment,
you
would
not
be
here?
unknown
speaker
you
say
that
here
basically
on
it
and
i
wanted
to
be
sure
of
your
status?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words
if
the
congressman
had
not
made
his
statement
you
would
be
here
anyway?
unknown
speaker
and
then
you
would
rely
on
what?
unknown
speaker
do
you
feel
the
eighth
circuit
case
in
eagles
essentially
at
odds
with
this
case
or
is
it
rather
a
--?
unknown
speaker
collateral
(voice
overlap)?
unknown
speaker
mr.
farr,
can
i
just
interrupt
with
another
question?
unknown
speaker
what
would
you
describe
as
the
purpose
of
section
2113
(d)?
unknown
speaker
but
to
the
extent
that
the
most
commonly
used
dangerous
weapon
in
bank
robberies
is
gun,
the
purpose
is
identical
then,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
mr.
farr,
undoubtedly,
perhaps
as
in
this
case
or
perhaps
not,
there
will
be
instances
where
the
facts
of
the
crime,
where
the
facts
necessary
to
prove
the
crime
under
2113
will
be
the
identical
facts
which
would
be
used
to
prove
the
crime
under
924
(c)
to
use
a
gun
to
rob
a
bank
and
put
somebody's
life
in
jeopardy,
you
are
going
to
violate
both
sections?
unknown
speaker
and
so
that
in
the
particular
instance
you
do
not
have
to
prove
any
different
facts
to
violate
one
section
as
compared
with
the
other?
unknown
speaker
it
may
be,
but
how
about
double
jeopardy?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
does
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
not
in
this
case
to
violate
the
statute,
you
do
not
have
to
prove
any
different
facts.
unknown
speaker
in
other
instances
there
--
unknown
speaker
but
you
just
do
not
have
to
prove
any
different
facts
in
a
situation
that
i
posed
to
you.
in
other
instances
you
will
have
a
crime
under
one
that
is
in
the
crime
on
to
the
other,
but
in
this
instance
the
same
facts
prove
a
violation
of
both
statutes?
unknown
speaker
do
they
overlap
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
and
you
think
is
it
enough
mr.
farr
to
put
a
man,
a
person's
life
in
jeopardy
in
robbing
a
bank
to
point
the
gun
at
somebody.
just
as
you
say,
if
you
have
used
the
gun
to
commit
the
bank
robbery
have
you
put
a
person's
life
in
jeopardy?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
do
you
use
it
otherwise?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
just
suggesting
to
you
that
even
on
the
language
of
the
statute
it
is
plain
that
there
will
be
all
sorts
of
instances
where
the
proof
is
identical?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
this,
in
a
charge
of
violation
of
2113(d),
where
the
dangerous
weapon
or
device
is
a
firearm,
loaded
always
inevitably,
universally
also
include
the
same
identical
proof
as
necessary
to
prove
the
violation
of
18
u.s.c.,
924(c)(1)
always,
inevitably
and
universally?
unknown
speaker
when
possibly
could
it
not?
when
the
(voice
overlap)
unknown
speaker
requires
more
than
just
use
of
the
gun,
but
it
always
does
require
use
of
the
gun?
unknown
speaker
and
requires
use
plus
other
things
and
924
(c)(1)
requires
use?
unknown
speaker
yes,
as
i
say
use
of
a
gun
plus
other
elements.
unknown
speaker
but
use
of
the
gun
as
a
single
element
in
924
(c)(1)?
unknown
speaker
so
that
evidence
will
always
going
to
include
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
say
whenever
the
weapon
is
a
firearm?
unknown
speaker
always
going
to
do
it
--
unknown
speaker
inevitably
and
universally?
unknown
speaker
924
(c)
will.
unknown
speaker
and
if
you
prove
that
a
robbery
of
the
bank?
if
that
is
unlawful,
i
do
not
know
what
it
is.
unknown
speaker
there
is
something
that
you
have
not
answered
mr.
justice
stewart
yet
why
that
(c)(1)
would
not
be
included
in
the
bank
robbery
crime
and
anytime
it
is
a
gun
that
he
uses?
unknown
speaker
mr.
farr
could
i
ask
it
from
the
other
point
of
view?
unknown
speaker
you
stress
the
fact
that
use
of
a
firearm
is
an
element
in
924
(c),
putting
life
in
jeopardy
is
the
element
in
2113
(d).
the
elements
are
different,
therefore,
even
though
the
act
is
the
same,
there
are
two
different
offenses,
but
is
it
possible
that
one
could
use
a
firearm
and
that
fact
be
brought
before
the
jury
and
that,
that
fact
itself
is
sufficient
proof
of
putting
a
life
in
jeopardy
so
there
really
is
no
difference
between
the
two
elements?
would
it
not
be
a
sufficient,
an
instruction
of
the
jury
on
the
issue
of
when
does
the
man's
life
is
put,
when
is
someone's
life
is
put
in
jeopardy,
would
the
judge
not
be
correct
in
instructing
a
jury
that
merely
evidence
showing
that
a
firearm
has
been
used
is
sufficient
to
establish
that
kind
of
jeopardy
that
2113
(d)
(voice
overlap)?
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
think
that
during
the
commission
of
a
bank
robbery?
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
think
that
you
have
to
fire
the
firearm,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
you
are
contending
a
2113
(d)
requires
the
firearm
to
be
fired?
unknown
speaker
just
has
to
be
used
during
the
--?
unknown
speaker
to
put
someone's
life
in
jeopardy
and
as
soon
as
it
is
used
someone's
life
is
in
jeopardy
and
also
you
have
established
the
element
in
924
(c)?
unknown
speaker
but
when
would
it
not
be
true?
that
you
use
a
firearm
in
a
bank
robbery
without
putting
anyone's
life
in
jeopardy
within
the
meaning
of
that
--?
unknown
speaker
and
you
do
not
think
evidence
of
that
could
be
taken
as
sufficient
to
show
jeopardy
to
life?
unknown
speaker
mr.
farr
can
i
ask,
i
am
sorry
to
keep
interrupting,
the
figures
relate
to
crimes
like
armed
robbery
and
assault,
the
statute
relates
to
use
of
a
firearm
in
a
felony
for
which
you
can
be
prosecute
in
a
federal
court.
unknown
speaker
now,
are
most
of
these
armed
robberies
and
assaults
federal
offense?
unknown
speaker
so
most
of
those
figures
really
are
not
relevant
to
what
the
element
of
statute
came
--
unknown
speaker
do
the
figures
tell
us
how
many
of
those
assaults
were
in
violation
of
federal
law?
unknown
speaker
would
not
congressional
purpose
in
the
gun
control
act
with
respect
to
bank
robberies
or
with
respect
to
2113
have
been
satisfied
if
the
indictment
had
simply
been
under
2113
(a)
and
then
18,
924
(c)?
unknown
speaker
if
it
was
to
put
a
special
penalty
on
for
committing
felonies
with
gun
that
would
have
--
unknown
speaker
and
that
will
allow
the
30
years
instead
of
25?
unknown
speaker
but
what
is
the
date
of
the
letter?
unknown
speaker
is
the
same
bulletin
extent
now?
unknown
speaker
in
the
same
manual,
the
same
manual
as
--
