mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
within
the
two
month
period
in
the
fall
of
1975,
petitioners
in
this
case
robbed
two
banks
in
middlesboro,
kentucky.
they
carried
and
used
firearms
in
the
commission
of
each
robbery
and
while
attempting
to
escape
from
the
second
robbery,
engaged
in
an
extensive
gunfire
with
the
police.
petitioners'
conduct
quite
plainly
violated
several
provisions
of
federal
law
and
the
juries
in
both
cases
so
found.
in
each
instance,
petitioners
were
convicted
under
18
u.s.c.
2113
(a)
which
makes
it
a
felony
to
rob
a
federal
bank
and
under
18
u.s.c.
2113
(d)
which
provides
an
increased
penalty
for
anyone
who
are
robbing
a
federal
bank
in
the
words
of
the
statute,
assaults
any
person
or
puts
in
jeopardy
the
life
of
any
person
by
the
use
of
a
dangerous
weapon
or
device.
petitioners
were
also
convicted
under
18
u.s.c.
924
(c)(1),
a
part
of
the
gun
control
act
of
1968,
which
provides
an
additional
term
of
imprisonment
for
anyone
who
in
the
words
of
that
statute,
uses
a
firearm
to
commit
any
felony
for
which
he
may
be
prosecuted
in
a
court
of
the
united
states.
the
trial
judge
sentenced
petitioners
to
the
maximum
terms
of
imprisonment
allowed
for
each
crime,
25
years
for
each
offense
under
section
2113
(d),
and
another
10
years
for
each
offense
under
section
924
(c),
all
sentences
to
be
served
consecutively.
petitioners
have
attacked
their
sentences
on
the
ground
that
924
(c)
while
seeming
on
its
face
to
apply
to
any
federal
felony
is
not
available
to
punish
bank
robbers
who
who
used
the
firearms
as
makes
the
absurdity
to
punishment
under
section
2113
(d)
as
well.
they
rely
for
this
proposition
on
a
statement
by
congressman
poff
who
sponsored
section
924
(c)
on
the
house
floor
that
this
bill
was
not
intended
to
apply
to
various
federal
offenses
of
which
bank
robbery
under
section
2113
is
one.
this
argument
in
our
view
raises
two
questions.
first,
did
congress
intend
section
924
(c)
apply
to
bank
robbers,
simultaneously
subject
to
conviction
under
section
2113
(d)
and
if
congress
did
so
intend,
secondly
does
the
double
jeopardy
clause
in
anyway
prohibit
that
result.
for
reasons
we
shall
discuss
in
a
moment,
i
believe
that
the
intent
of
congress
to
punish
for
both
offenses
is
evident
from
the
statute
itself
and
from
the
way
to
the
legislative
history.
we
furthermore
believe
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
not
prohibited
from
doing
so.
looking
at
the
language
of
section
924(c),
we
did
not
perceive
any
serious
question
about
the
meaning
of
the
statute
on
its
face.
indeed
we
do
not
understand
petitioners
today
to
say
anything
to
the
contrary.
while
its
terms
it
applies
to
any
felony
for
which
a
person
may
be
prosecuted
in
a
court
of
the
united
states,
the
definition
they
claim
includes
all
degrees
of
bank
robbery
and
this
case
when
argued
before
this
court
50
or
75
years
ago,
that
clear
language
would
likely
have
been
not
the
starting,
but
the
stop
in
place
for
an
inquiry
into
congressional
intent.
the
court
entered
the
rigid
and
vulnerable
dictates
to
the
'plain
meaning'
rule.
although,
that
rule
no
longer
commands
absolute
allegiance,
even
today
we
think
that
the
language
of
a
statute
must
remain
the
most
secured
evidence
of
the
legislative
intent.
as
justice
jackson
stated,
it
is
the
business
of
congress
to
sum
up
its
own
debates
in
its
legislation
and
where
congress
is
unable
to
do
so
clearly
--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that
is
the
situation
that
came
up
in
the
crew
case
your
honor
and
the
fourth
circuit
held
he
could
not.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
think
in
terms
of
whether
he
could
be
indicted,
it
perhaps
may
not
be
right,
but
i
think
he
could
not
properly
be
convicted
and
consecutively
sentenced
for
both
the
violation
of
(c)(1)
and
(c)(2).
i
think
it
might
be
permissible
indictments
so
that
you
can
see
what
do
show
--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
i
think
that
even
if
that
were
true
that
there
is
no
evidence
that
congress
intended
in
fact
to
get
at
the
situation
where
you
are
carrying
one
yourself
and
also
--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
i
think
we
are
not
necessarily
relying,
we
are
not
suggesting
that
you
could
rely
only
on
the
language
of
924
(c)
in
order
to
support
this.
in
fact,
we
agree
that
one
of
the
situations
which
congressman
poff
posed
which
would
be
other
offenses
set
forth
under
gun
control
act
of
1968
itself,
might
be
situations
in
which
the
congressional
intent
was
really
not
to
impose
punishment
for
924
(c)
and
perhaps
purchasing
a
gun.
in
other
words,
offenses
that
cannot
be
committed
without
a
gun
in
the
first
place.
however,
we
do
not
reach
at
that
conclusion
by
reliance
on
what
congressman
poff
said
directly,
but
by
the
fact
that
what
it
seems
to
lead
if
somewhat
awkward
result
to
the
fact
that
it
does
seem
to
go
beyond
the
congressional
purpose
in
this
case
which
is
to
attach
some
additional
penalty.
so
we
are
doing
it
really
by
a
construction
of
the
statute
in
light
of
its
overall
purpose
and
the
evils
of
which
it
was
directed
not
simply
by
relying
on
one's
statement
by
the
sponsor's
of
the
bill.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
do
not
have
any
statistics
on
that.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
i
think
its
possible
to,
you
say
non
lethal
weapons
meaning
not
a
firearm?
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
in
that
by
924
(c).
well,
i
think
that
there
probably
are
some
bank
robberies
that
are
committed
with
knives
or
with
some
sort
of
blunt
instruments,
but
i
would
think
the
majority
of
them
would
be
committed
with
a
firearm,
but
i
also
should
point
out
the
thing
--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
pardon
me?
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
as
far
as
i
concerned
it
is,
it
does
not
necessarily
make
any
difference,
it
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
think
congress
meant
--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
think
congress
meant
to
put
an
additional
penalty
on
any
crime
that
was
committed
with
a
firearm.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
they
could
in
fact
have
done
that.
they
could
have
gone
through
the
united
states
code
and
added
an
additional
penalty
to
every
single
offense
that
was
in
it.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
they
could
have
done
it
with
bank
robbery
and
they
could
have
done
with
any
other
offense.
what
they
did
instead
and
our
belief
is
that
it
passed
a
single
statute
that
applied
to
any
felony,
and
therefore,
just
did
it
in
one
piece
of
legislation
rather
than
numerous
pieces,
but
they
could
have
done
the
way
you
have
suggested,
i
agree.
returning
for
a
moment
to
discussion
of
the
'plain
meaning'
rule,
i
was
about
to
suggest
that
where
congress
has
not
been
able
to
state
its
meaning
clearly
in
a
statute,
but
whereby
reading
the
statute
in
connection
with
the
congressional
purpose,
it
obviously
leads
to
awkward
results,
or
indeed
where
the
subject
to
the
legislation
is
so
complex
that
congress
cannot
reasonably
foresee
and
provide
for
all
matters
that
will
ultimately
arise,
some
relaxation
of
the
'plain
meaning'
rule
was
inevitably
necessary.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
i
am
not
suggesting
that
this
is
an
awkward
result
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
think
that
in
this
particular
case
that
the
congress
is
aiming
to
impose
what
is
not
an
awkward
result,
but
a
reasonable
result
on
people
who
use
guns
to
commit
crimes.
where
however
as
we
believe
it
is
true
in
this
case,
the
objects
of
the
legislation
are
not
complex
the
language
is
straightforward
and
the
results
of
adherence
to
the
language
of
the
statute,
or
equally
as
reasonable
if
not
more
so
than
the
results
of
departure
from
it,
then
it
seems
that
the
court
should
exercise
great
caution
when
it
proceeds
past
the
language
of
the
statute
to
the
legislative
history,
and
therefore,
we
believe
it
is
very
important
to
examine
carefully
the
legislative
history,
essentially
congressman
poff's
statement,
the
petitioners
in
this
case
find
so
compelling
and
to
give
it
a
proper
place
in
the
context,
the
passage
of
the
gun
control
act
of
1968.
this
perhaps
will
direct
more
to
mr.
justice
marshall's
question
about
what
congress
intended
to
do
in
these
situations.
we
think
its
first
appropriate
in
doing
that
to
examine
the
purpose
of
the
gun
control
act
itself.
in
this
context,
there
can
be
a
little
doubt
that
about
the
evils
which
prompted
enactment
of
the
gun
control
act,
the
problem
simply
put
was
guns.
the
presidential
commission
report
published
in
february
1967,
and
considered
by
congress
in
connection
with
the
passage
of
several
bills
had
set
forth
alarming
figures
on
the
use
of
guns
to
commit
crimes.
figures
that
had
worsened
by
the
end
of
that
year.
for
example
the
house
report
on
the
gun
control
act
show
that
in
the
13
months
ending
in
september
1967,
50,000
people
had
been
murdered
or
assaulted
with
guns
and
similar
the
number
of
robberies
including
bank
robberies
with
guns
had
taken
place.
the
senate
report
using
figures
for
all
of
the
1967
showed
over
60,000
murders
and
assaults
and
over
70,000
robberies
all
committed
with
guns,
an
average
of
150
armed
assaults
and
190
armed
robberies
each
day.
the
house
report
accompanying
its
version
of
the
gun
control
bill
stated
plainly
that
no
civilized
society
can
ignore
the
malignancy,
which
this
senseless
slaughter
reflects.
you
might
also
note
that
this
concern
was
not
confined
to
the
congress
itself.
the
assassinations
of
robert
kennedy
and
of
martin
luther
king
had
mobilized
public
support
for
greater
controls
on
firearms
as
well.
indeed
senator
davidson
(ph)
indicated
that
in
one
month
alone
he
received
over
100,000
letters
favoring
gun
registration.
the
overriding
purpose
of
the
act
therefore
was
to
take
strong
majors
to
inhibit
the
use
of
firearms
in
serious
crimes
and
those
majors
took
two
principle
forms.
first,
greater
federal
controls
over
the
sale
and
shipment
of
guns,
provisions
that
are
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
would
think
that
the
purpose
of
2113
(d)
is
to
deter
bank
robbers
from
using
dangerous
weapons
in
connection
with
that,
not
only
bank
robbers,
but
people
committing
any
crime
under
2113
(a)
and
(b)
which
includes
larceny
and
attempts
to
commit
crime.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
i
think
the
purpose
is
identical
if
you
assume
that
there
is
no
purpose
to
add
increased
deterrence
to
something
true
and
i
think
that
the
statistics
show
that
the
most
commonly
used
weapon
to
commit
murder
is
also
a
gun,
but
this
i
do
not
think
anybody
would
dispute
that
because
the
statute
would
also
add
a
penalty
to
that
crime,
that
it
should
be
read
not
to
include
coverage
of
murder.
the
second
measure
that
the
congress
used
to
attack,
increase
crime
by
use
of
guns
was
simply
increasing
the
penalties
for
the
use
of
the
firearms
in
serious
crimes.
we
do
think
it
is
significant.
every
court
of
appeals
that
has
placed
principle
emphasis
on
the
language
in
purpose
of
section
924
(c)
has
concluded
that
it
is
available
to
convict
and
punish
bank
robbers
also
subject
to
punishment
under
section
2113
(d).
in
addition
to
the
sixth
circuit
in
this
case,
the
second
circuit,
fourth
circuit,
and
fifth
circuit
have
so
decided.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that
is
correct
and
in
fact
this
is
a
--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that
is
correct,
but
i
think
that,
that
is
coincidental
rather
than
something
that
derives
directly
from
the
requirements
of
the
statute
itself.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
i
think
that
the
court
said
in
iannelli,
if
each
statute
requires
a
different
element
and
the
other
does.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
the
statute
does,
the
statute
requires
proof
of
different
elements
--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
order
to
prove,
you
have
to
prove
certain
different
facts
--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
in
order
to
prove
a
violation
of
the
statute.
the
fact
that
you
are
able
to
prove
them
by
the
same
evidence,
does
not
seem
to
me
to
put
you
on
double
jeopardy.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
as
i
said
it
seems
to
me
that,
that
there
are
situations.
we
are
not
suggesting
that
they
will
not
be
situations
where
the
proof
does
not
overlap,
but
it
does
not
seem
to
me
that
that
it
was
--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
the
proof
does
overlap
in
this
case.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
these
people
took
a
gun.
the
petitioners
brought
guns
into
the
bank,
used
to
them
to
assault
people
while
they
were
robbing
the
bank.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
it
seems
to
me,
if
you
are
using
the
gun,
if
you
are
directing
the
gun
at
people,
yes.
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
absolutely
sensible.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
oh!
assuming
there
are
several
--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
assume
that
there
are
several
reasons
that
he
could
be
carrying
a
gun,
whether
he
is
going
to
use
it
or
not.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
in
connection
with
using
it,
i
suppose
it
is
possible
for
him
to
use
a
gun
for
instance
to
shoot
open
the
door
of
the
bank
to
break
the
glass.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
in
that
case,
certainly
--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
my
understanding
of
justice
white's
question
is
that
there
are
possible
cases
in
which
he
could
be
carrying
it
and
in
which
he
would
be
not
using
it.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
to
begin
he
could
carry
it
in
this
pocket,
but
that
would
violation
of
section
(c)(2)
not
(c)(1).
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
think
that
is
correct.
i
think
that
there
will
be
numerous
instances
in
which
the
proof
is
identical.
well,
in
fact
there
will
be
instances
in
which
the
proof
is
not
identical.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
think
in
the
majority
of
cases
it
will.
i
am
not
sure
that
--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
what
seems
to
me
is
possible
to
use
a
gun
in
attempting
to
commit
for
instance
a
crime
under
the
part
of
2113
(a)
which
requires
--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
it
does
require
use
of
the
gun.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
however,
it
requires
use
of
the
gun
in
a
bank
robbery.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
possibly,
that
is
right.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that
is
right,
but
of
course
21
--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
if
the
statute
said,
if
2113
(d)
said,
whoever
puts
anybody's
life
in
jeopardy
by
the
use
of
a
firearm
--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that
in
fact
would
be
a
different
case
--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
but
the
statute
of
course
does
not
--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
right.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
it
does
not
seem
to
me
that
if
congress
is
able
to
pass
the
statute
where
the
terms
of
the
statute
require
proof
of
different
elements
it
seems
to
me
that
they
are
permitted
to
do
that
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
it
does
not
strike
me
that
the
statute
is
positing
–
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
it
does
not
strike
me
that
the
statute
here
positing
would
in
fact,
it
would
be
a
different
element
in
terms
of
that
statute
would
have
an
additional
element
that
the
924
(c)
does,
but
not
sure
what
924
(c)
would
have.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that
it
was
an
automatic.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that
would
be
an
additional
requirement
that
924
(c)
does
not
have,
but
that
statute
does
not
have
--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
which
person
assumed
that
it
was
loaded?
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
in
other
words
you
can
keep
on
spinning
examples
mr.
justice
marshall.
it
will
add
elements
--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
to
a
particular
crime.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
but
the
fact
is,
that
the
fact
that
crime
contains
an
element
that
the
first
crime
did
not,
does
not
meant
that
the
reverse
is
true
--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
and
that
is
what
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
it
is
identical
if
2113
(d)
said,
if
2113
(d)
required
that
the
weapon
be
a
firearm
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
a
different
case.
the
fact
that
it
may
be
a
firearm
--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
in
this
case
it
was.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that
is
correct,
but
i
do
not
--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
except
to
that
has
to
be
carried
unlawfully,
so
it
is
not
necessarily
true,
but
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
am
not
sure
that
makes
to
carrying
of
the
firearm.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that
would
certainly
remove
one
of
the
possible
ways
in
which
the
carrying
would
be
unlawful.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
i
think
that
is
part
of
what
we
are
trying
to
find
out
in
this
case.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
anytime
that
it
is
a
gun,
i
mean,
if
you
take
a
situation
and
posit
all
the
facts
to
being
identical
or
even
posit
some
of
them
as
being
identical,
you
can
make
the
statute
is
dovetail.
the
fact
is
that
the
statutes
do
not
have
to
dovetail.
it
seems
to
me
the
question
that
congress
is
entitled
to
define
crimes
differently
and
still
remain
flexible
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
even
though
the
elements
of
proof
may
substantially
overlap
and
in
fact
it
seems
that
the
court
said
that
in
iannelli.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
yes,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
do
not
think
necessarily,
i
do
not
think
that
the
fact
--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
it
depends,
i
mean,
it
depends
on
what
the
facts
of
the
robbery
were.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
pardon
me?
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
no,
we
are
not
contending
that.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that
is
correct,
but
it
does
--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
again,
i
think
in
most
cases
that
will
be
true,
but
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
what
seems
to
me
if
you
have
to
use
--
what
is
perhaps
a
strange
example,
but
i
think
one
is
legitimate
under
the
facts
if
he
used
a
firearm
to
shoot
open
the
door
to
a
bank
and
broke
in
and
(voice
overlap)
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
not,
if
there
was
nobody
in
the
bank,
no.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
the
blockburger
case
was
not
a
double
jeopardy
case.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
but
it
seems
to
me
for
instance
in
gore
(ph)
that
it
was
used,
clearly
they
used
the
same
sort
of
arguments
to
deal
with
it
in
a
double
jeopardy
context
in
brown
v.
ohio
last
year.
it
seems
to
me
the
court
quite
finally
stated
that
that
was
the
test,
but
i
think
in
speaking
of
gore
(ph),
it
seems
to
me
that
that
provides
a
different
way
of
looking
at
the
statute.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
congress
is
free
in
defining
crimes
and
fixing
punishments
to
pass
the
statute
that
says
if
you
rob
a
bank,
you
face
a
maximum
penalty
of
20
years.
if
you
use
a
dangerous
in
the
course
of
that
25
years,
and
if
that
weapon
is
a
gun
35
years
is
the
maximum
penalty,
and
it
does
not
seem
to
me
that
the
effects
of
this
statute
are
necessarily
any
different
than
that
one.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
am
unaware
of
that
letter
and
we
did
not
get
a
copy
of
it
from
petitioners
and
--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
am
sorry.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
no,
no.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
it
is
something
that
has
not
been
made
available
to
me
and
i
understand
from
what
petitioners’
counsel
said
this
afternoon
about
it,
that
it
is
a
policy
statement
by
the
department
of
justice
which
--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
and
i
will,
if
i
can
have
a
copy
of
it
from
petitioners’
counsel,
if
tell
me,
i
will
track
it
down
and
i
will
find
out
what
it
involves
and
report
to
the
court.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
would
like
to
point
out
before
the
questioning
started
a
few
moments
ago
i
was
discussing
the
figures
that
were
in
front
of
congress
showing
the
increasing
number
of
crimes
committed
with
guns
and
i
pointed
out
in
the
course
of
that
that
among
the
most
serious
figures
which
congress
specifically
included
in
its
reports,
were
figures
relating
to
armed
robberies
and
aggravated
assaults.
now,
where
congressman
poff's
statements
about
the
scope
of
section
924
(c)
allowed
to
override
the
language
of
the
statute,
in
fact
the
congressional
solution
to
the
problem
they
perceive
would
be
much
narrower
than
the
problem
that
it
addressed.
if
the
court
--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
would
think
that
most
of
them,
that
this
includes
federal
and
state
offenses
and
i
would
think
that
--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
do
not
think
the
figures
in
terms
of
their
absolute
numbers
are
necessarily
allow
them.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
the
figures
do
not
no,
but
what
the
figures
do
do
is
indicate
that
there
is
a
substantial
problem
with
which
congress
was
concerned
and
that
dealt
with
a
state
problem
and
the
federal
problem
with
the
licensing
requirements,
but
obviously
it
did
not
feel
that
that
was
sufficient
to
take
care
of
all
the
crimes
because
it
did
add
a
section
924
(c)
that
applies
to
federal
crimes
alone.
so
we
are
not
suggesting
that
it
will
effect
every
crime,
but
that
the
problem
was
both
state
and
the
federal
and
congress
recognized
it.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
the
figures
specifically
did
not,
no,
but
congressman
poff
--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
we
are
talking
about
that
in
this
particular
case,
but
congressman
poff
in
fact
fact
was
talking
about
something
more
than
that,
because
he
said
that
his
statute
would
not
only
be
inapplicable
to
the
bank
robberies
under
section
2113,
but
certain
other
robberies,
including
armed
robberies
of
the
mails
and
also
to
virtually
all
armed
assaults
under
all
of
the
federal
assault
statutes.
so
that
in
order
to
accept
his
version
of
924
(c)
you
would
have
to
believe
that
though
congress
was
very
concerned
about
the
rise
in
crimes,
including
armed
robberies
and
armed
assaults,
that
it
deliberately
enacted
legislation
which
would
not
apply
to
federal
armed
robberies,
most
of
them
or
some,
at
least
bank
robberies
and
mail
robberies
or
federal
assault
which
does
not
strike
me
as
making
much
sense.
we
have
also
pointed
out
in
our
brief
that
the
other
amendments
introduced
on
this
subject
do
not
make
any
such
distinction
between
felonies
that
already
have
a
penalty
for
use
of
a
dangerous
weapon
put
into
them
in
the
house
congressman
casey
had
introduced
an
amendment,
putting
substantial
additional
penalties
on
persons
who
used
a
gun
during
certain
federal
crimes,
including
robbery
and
assault.
so
far
from
exempting
bank
robberies
and
armed
assaults,
the
casey
amendments
specifically
included
them.
in
the
senate,
senator
dominick
introduced
a
bill
which
impose
similar
penalties
for
use
of
guns
in
any
federal
crime
of
violence
and
that
was
defined
specifically
to
include
assault
with
a
dangerous
weapon
and
robbery
and
senator
dominick
was
fully
aware
that
there
were
statutes
which
already
provided
increased
penalties
such
as
2113
(d)
and
said
that
his
amendment
was
not
intended
to
detract
form
or
repeal
those
provisions,
but
would
be
available
to
prosecutors,
in
addition
to
them
for
stronger
penalties
if
they
so
desire.
now,
the
casey
amendment
was
replaced
by
the
poff
bill
and
then
in
conference
committee,
the
poff
amendment
was
used
rather
than
the
dominick
amendment,
but
there
is
no
indication
anywhere
that
the
house
and
senate
as
a
whole
or
the
conference
committee
of
which
congressman
poff
incidentally
was
not
a
member
deliberately
endorsed
an
effort
to
immunize
serious
federal
crimes,
certain
serious
federal
crimes
and
the
remedy
set
forth
in
that
act.
in
fact,
given
the
overall
purpose
of
the
gun
control
act
and
given
the
apparent
common
understanding
of
the
poff
amendment
and
the
alternatives
in
the
house
and
senate,
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
a
language
that
would
express
more
clearly
an
intent,
restraint
for
the
laws
relating
to
the
use
of
guns
in
all
federal
felonies.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
some
of
it.
if
you
assume
that
the
purpose
of
congress
was
to
put
a
special
--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
if
it
is
to
put
a
special
penalty
on
that
perhaps
would
suffice
to
put
an
additional
and
special
penalty
for.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
in
that
particular
case
that
is
true.
however,
there
are
other
statutes
where
it
does
not
work
out
so
cleanly.
as
we
have
indicated
in
other
statutes
even
within
2113
(d),
the
governing
felony
statute,
the
larceny
statute
would
provide
for
much
lower
penalty
than
20
years
which
is
the
2113
(a),
so
by
adding
on
the
additional
penalty,
you
do
not
really
get
up
to
the
same
place
that
you
would
under
2113
(d).
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
no
further
questions?
