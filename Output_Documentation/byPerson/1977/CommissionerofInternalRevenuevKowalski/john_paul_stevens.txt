justice
john
paul
stevens
and
your
first
point
that
the
substitution
of
the
meal
allowance
for
the
meal
station
system
was
more
convenient
for
the
state
in
the
prior
system,
but
that
is
enough
to
satisfy
the
test
of
convenience
for
the
state.
does
that
mean
anytime
you
have
very
inefficient
system
and
you
have
changed
to
something
better
that
that
would
satisfy
the
test?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
by
the
definition,
your
system
did
not
satisfy
the
test
because
you
found
it
inconvenient?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
at
the
time
of
the
change
it
apparently
did
not?
at
the
time,
one
day
before
you
made
the
change
it
was
obviously
inconvenient
to
the
state?
