mr.
smith,
before
you
do,
in
your
brief
on
page
6,
you
say
the
tax
court
unanimously
held
that
the
cash
payments
did
not
qualify
for
the
exclusion
for
gross
income
under
section
119,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
it
sounds
like
the
case
we
have
just
heard.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
all
these
years
i
have
been
misreporting?
unknown
speaker
judicial
conference.
unknown
speaker
i
have
never
put
this
on
my
dissent
--
unknown
speaker
rather
neither
in
the
statement
--
unknown
speaker
i
think
i
better
disqualify
myself
in
this
case
?
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith
your
answer
to
the
chief
justices
question
that
these
allowances
at
any
event
are
gross
income
leads
for
me
to
this
question
which
may
be
at
the
very
outer
bounds
of
relevancy
but
that
will
not
stop
me
from
asking
it.
as
i
understand,
the
past
three
or
four
presidents
of
the
country
have
received
what
recalled
tax
free
expense
allowances,
in
addition
to
their
salaries.
now,
are
those
gross
income
for
those
persons?
unknown
speaker
so
that
simply
depends
on
the
wording
of
the
particular
statute?
unknown
speaker
and
the
mundane
factor
of
federal
judges
--
you
distinguish
them,
do
you?
you
do
not
distinguish
federal
judges
from
state
highway
patrolmen
do
you,
for
these
purposes?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
significance
in
that
payment
in
advance?
unknown
speaker
somewhere
in
your
argument
would
you
differentiate
any
services
treatment
on
military
allowances
of
this
kind
--
unknown
speaker
and
the
statute
troopers
allowance
and
tell
us
precisely
why
one
is
in
and
one
is
out?
unknown
speaker
you
are
not
suggesting
that
what
the
employer
thinks
it
ought
to
do
to
govern
his
tax
consequences?
unknown
speaker
he
has
to
explain
it
in
someway
if
its
on
w-2
form
and
hence
its
perfectly
natural
for
him
to
report
or
it
makes
some
reference
to
his
--
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
question
as
was
it
the
gross
income?
unknown
speaker
except
for
section
119
it
would
be
that?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
the
key
to
it
is
they
have
got
to
furnish
the
food?
unknown
speaker
there
is
nothing
to
do
with
overtime?
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith
suppose
your
employer
erred
in
the
case
you
have
put,
you
said,
you
may
not
leave
the
factory
premises
during
the
lunch,
would
that
make
a
difference?
unknown
speaker
your
case
really
comes
down
to
whether
the
refund
is
in
cash
or
whether
there
is
--?
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith,
i
gathered
from
your
answer
to
justice
blackmuns
question
about
the
treatment
of
military
meals
and
little
payments,
that
kind
but
there
is
no
expressed
statutory
authority
for
treating
them
differently
from
state
troopers?
you
have
referred
to
the
court
of
claims,
treasury
regulations
and
to
a
committee
report,
but
there
is
expressed
statutory
position?
unknown
speaker
and
i
suppose
that
statute
on
uniform
personnel,
you
are
bound
to
read
as
limited
federal
--
unknown
speaker
personnel.
unknown
speaker
is
the
barracks
point
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
and
whether
or
not
that
lodging
his
income
is
not
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith
stated
that
the
withholding
began
in
1970
that
is
correct.
the
state
of
new
jersey
started
withholding
on
the
troopers
meal
allowances
in
response
to
pressure
from
the
internal
revenue
service
which
have
been
going
on
by
a
correspondence
over
a
period
of
several
years?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
the
test
is
more
convenient
than
the
predecessor
system?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
which
statute
61
or
119?
unknown
speaker
would
not
be
within
61?
unknown
speaker
neither
one
would
be
and
you
are
not
relying
at
the
moment
at
all
on
119?
unknown
speaker
mr.
cordes,
as
i
understand
the
sg's
position,
it
is
quite
immaterial
whether
the
meals
are
being
furnished
for
the
convenience
of
the
state
or
that.
the
issue
deals
with
as
i
understand
it
quite
simply
to
rather
than
that
they
were
paid
in
cash
or
while
the
meals
were
furnished
in
kind?
unknown
speaker
that
is
for
119,
but
your
--
unknown
speaker
you
said,
solicitor
general
to
make
that
broad
generalization.
now,
119
is
quite
explicit
in
that
respect.
now,
the
saunders
case
reached
a
different
result.
it
says
that
it
was
immaterial
rather
they
were
paid
in
cash
or
were
provided
in
kind.
is
that
the
only
case
that
reached
that
conclusion,
best
only
for
section
61
before
119
was
enacted?
unknown
speaker
and
cash
payment?
unknown
speaker
some
of
those
exclusions
from
gross
income
are
the
result
of
court
decisions,
are
they
not?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
this
was
not
a
voluntary
act
that
raised
on
the
part
of
the
internal
revenue
service?
unknown
speaker
and
regardless
of
whether
they
eat
or
not?
unknown
speaker
now,
is
it
true
as
it
is
not
the
lieutenants
receive
larger
meal
allowance
than
troopers
and
captains
receive
a
larger
meal
allowance
than
lieutenants?
unknown
speaker
and
major
is
a
larger
one
than
captains?
unknown
speaker
and
the
superintendent,
the
largest
of
all?
unknown
speaker
and
no
claim
that
they
have
different
appetites
as
a
class,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
now
wait
a
minute,
the
superintendent
is
driven
by
a
trooper.
is
he
not?
unknown
speaker
mr.
cordes
supposing
you
had
all
the
same
regulations
about
what
they
had
to
do
during
the
lunch
hour
-
carry
a
radio
on
where
they
and
all
the
rest
and
they
did
not
get
a
meal
allowance,
but
instead
they
were
paid
an
extra
$15
per
day
whatever
might
be,
but
these
had
little
higher
salary.
how
would
one
system
serve
for
the
convenience
of
employer
more
than
the
other?
unknown
speaker
may
i
suggest
that
is
not
responsive
to
my
question?
how
does
one
system
serve
the
convenience
of
the
employer
more
than
the
other,
the
two
alternatives
i
gave
you.
unknown
speaker
this
is
subject
to
a
collective
bargaining
and
has
been
between
the
troopers
union
and
the
state?
unknown
speaker
no,
it
would
not.
unknown
speaker
i
did
not
--
i
just
asked
a
question
whether
or
not
it
is?
unknown
speaker
and
i
suppose
it
is
higher
now
than
it
was
in
1970?
unknown
speaker
as
a
result
of
a
collective
bargaining.
unknown
speaker
but
if
congress
has
recognized
the
meal
allowance
and
so
forth
for
military
by
separate
statute,
does
not
that
remove
some
of
the
necessity
for
bringing
it
under
the
convenience
of
the
employer
doctrine?
unknown
speaker
i
have
checked
that
exclusion
--
i
came
out
of
the
armed
services
committee
rather
than
what
is
in
the
--
unknown
speaker
it
is
still
a
congressional
recognition?
unknown
speaker
suppose
if
you
could
--
revenue
people
could
go
on
and
tax
in
a
military
bill,
instead,
they
will
not
be
paid?
unknown
speaker
mr.
cordes,
i
take
it
you
are
placing
no
reliance
on
162?
unknown
speaker
and
162
provides
what?
unknown
speaker
alright.
unknown
speaker
my
question
is
are
you
relying
on
it?
unknown
speaker
despite
correll
--
unknown
speaker
when
we
are
in
the
premises
of
the
employer,
then
would
it?
unknown
speaker
that
he
eats
in
the
car?
