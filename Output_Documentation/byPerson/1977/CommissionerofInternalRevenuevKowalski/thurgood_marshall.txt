justice
thurgood
marshall
i
do
not
know,
these
men
work
in
eight
hour
shifts?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
they
need
lunch
during
an
eight
hour
shift?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah,
the
other
point
is,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
shows
that
they
need
special
food
at
the
lunch?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
is
a
just
regular
meal
or
lunch?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
you
also
have
a
stipulation
and
said
not
two
people
eat
exact
amount
of
food?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
i
mean,
well,
they
both
stop
and
eat
lunch,
why
did
the
superintendent
get
more,
could
not
the
trooper
eat
at
the
same
place
he
eats
and
he
eats
the
same
food
he
eats?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
involved
in
your
case,
it
is
a
fact
that
for
some
reason
which
uptil
now
had
not
been
explained
to
on
merit
not
being
explained
at
least
to
me.
a
superintendent,
sitting
behind
a
desk
,
he
is
more
fool
than
a
trooper
running
up
and
down
the
rule.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
--
these
may
not
in
the
--
that
somebody
had
never
been
near
the
military?
justice
thurgood
marshall
may
be
we
should
adopt
that
in
the
court?
