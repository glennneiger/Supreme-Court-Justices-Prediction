justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
this
case,
the
tax
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
disagreed
on
the
question
whether
cash
meal
allowances
paid
to
new
jersey's
state
police
troopers
are
income
with
in
the
section
61
(a)
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
and
whether
even
if
they
are
income
within
that
section,
are
nonetheless
excludable
under
section
119
of
the
code
as
meals
furnished
for
the
convenience
of
the
employer.
the
tax
court
held
that
the
cash
payments
were
income
within
section
61
(a)
and
were
not
excludable
under
section
119.
the
court
of
appeals
took
the
contrary
view
in
reversed
holding
that
even
if
the
payments
were
income
under
61
(a),
they
were
excludable
under
section
119.
we
agree
with
the
tax
court
and
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals.
we
therefore
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
blackmun,
joined
by
the
chief
justice,
dissents
and
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
