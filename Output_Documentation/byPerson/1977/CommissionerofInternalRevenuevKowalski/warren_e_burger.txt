you

mr.
smith
while
we
have
you
there,
you
have
in
mind
that
when
judge
--
federal
judge
is
assigned
to
another
circuit
or
if
in
his
regular
duties,
a
district
judge
goes
to
another
station,
he
sits,
he
has
given,
i
think
its
$50
a
day
allowance
if
he
identifies
the
expenditure
so
much
for
his
room,
so
much
for
meals
and
now
since
the
judge
presumably
eats
breakfast,
lunch
and
dinner
when
he
is
at
home,
bear
in
mind
at
some
points
at
your
convenience
would
you
tell
me
what
do
you
think
of
that
situation,
under
this
duration
or
anyone
like
it,
would
the
judge
be
required
to
take
treat
as
income,
breakfast,
lunch,
dinner?
chief
justice
warren
e.

that
is
not
true
with
federal
judge,
he
has
no
business
expenses
in
the
sense
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
try
this
hypothetical
on
you.
suppose
in
a
state
trooper
situation
they
have
a
base
somewhere
with
the
radio
dispature
that
communicates
with
all
the
cars
and
dispature,
let
us
assume
also,
the
dispature
is
on
duty,
nine
hours
a
day.
that
is
the
terms
of
his
employment
and
he
is
required
by
the
terms
of
the
employment
to
eat
on
the
premises
and
go
down
to
the
cafeteria,
pick
up
the
tray
and
bring
it
back
to
the
his
gear,
his
broadcasting
gear
and
remain
on
duty
throughout
the
lunch
period
in
order
to
handle
calls
to
and
from
troopers
in
the
field,
would
you
say
that
was
deductible
--
that
was
gross
income?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
they
do
to
say
book
keeping,
they
just
allow
him
to
go
down
to
get
a
free
meal.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
suppose
the
rules
of
state
troopers
required
them
at
meal
time
to
a
drive
to
a
restaurant,
get
the
food
in
the
restaurant
and
then
bring
it
into
the
car
and
eat
it
in
the
car
so
there
would
within
reach
of
their
radio
at
all
times,
would
you
say
that
was
--?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
two
of
those
requirements
are
clearly
met
are
they
not,in
my
hypothetical?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
is
on
the
premises
if
he
is
eating
in
the
car,
is
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
let
us
back
up
to
my
radio
dispature
again
and
the
state
authorities
decided
it
is
too
expensive
to
maintain
the
barracks
cafeteria
and
so
they
dispense
for
that,
but
say
to
the
radio
operator,
you
must
be
on
duty
and
he
sends
across
the
street
to
mcdonald's
or
at
some
place?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
does
that
bear
on
the
tax
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
if
they
can
deal
with
that
sort
of
a
problem
by
saying
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
cordes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
course,
but
you
were
not
given
that
phonetic
a
to
the.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
do
you
say
that
adds
up
to
the
convenience
of
the
state?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
ultimate
objective
was
to
keep
these
men
on
the
job,
60
minutes,
out
of
every
hour
at
all
times
when
they
were
on
duty
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
your
position
is
that
either
of
them
would
satisfy
the
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
does
is
not
come
back
to
what
mr.
stuart
himself
suggested,
mr.
smith
suggested
that
sometimes
calling
a
thing
by
a
name
makes
it
one
way
or
the
other
under
tax
law
as
distinguished
under
the
law
generally?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
did
not
call
a
pay
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
which
the
government
as
i
understand
concedes,
was
not
taxable?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
you
do
not
agree
with
mr.
smith
that
is
just
has
faded
the
fact
of
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
thank
you.
now,
mr.
smith
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
it
not
serve,
the
convenience
of
the
employer
that
is
the
state
of
new
jersey.
they
have
this
man
on
duty
and
on
call
for
60
minutes
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
is
no
lunch
hour.
.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
will
go
back
to
my
hypothetical,
i
put
to
you.
if
they
gave
him
the
box
lunch
before
he
left
the
barracks
then
you
say
that
that
is
not
taxable?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
number
76-1095,
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
against
kowalski
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
brennan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
brennan.
