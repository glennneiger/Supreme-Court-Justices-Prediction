mr.
stuart
a.
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
federal
income
tax
case
commissioner
v.
kowalski
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states,
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
it
presents
a
single
question
with
two
subparts,
whether
cash
payments
to
state
police
troopers
of
whom
kowalski
was
one,
which
are
designated
as
meal
allowances
are
includable
in
gross
income
under
section
61
(a)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954,
and
are
not
otherwise
excludable
from
income
under
a
special
exclusion
provision
section
119,
which
came
into
the
tax
law
at
the
time
of
the
1954
codification.
in
a
brief
per
curiam
opinion,
the
third
circuit
reversed
a
review
decision
of
the
tax
court
with
respect
to
both
code
sections
and
held
that
the
meal
payments
in
question
here
were
not
gross
income,
and
even
if
they
were,
they
were
excludable
under
section
119.
we
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
as
to
both
points
that
the
cash
payments
or
gross
income
as
that
fundamental
term
in
the
tax
law
as
defined
by
section
61
(a)
and
that
the
cash
payments
here
do
not
qualify
for
the
limited
exclusion
provided
by
section
119
of
the
code
which
briefly
provides
for
an
exclusion
for
meals
furnished
by
an
employer
to
his
employee
for
the
convenience
of
the
employer,
but
only
if
the
meals
are
furnished
on
the
employer?s
business
premises.
so,
in
this
sense
the
section
61
(a)
aspect
of
the
court
of
appeals?
decision
is
the
most
troublesome
and
extraordinary
one
from
our
point
of
view
because
it
holds
that
a
cash
payment
by
an
employer
to
his
employee
to
defray
the
cost
of
what
is
indisputably
a
personal
expense,
the
cost
of
eating
lunch
during
the
day,
does
not
fit
within
the
statutory
phrase
'gross
income'
from
whatever
source
derived.
i
think
that
i
can
set
forth
the
facts
briefly
they
are
undisputed.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
that
is
correct.
there
were
5
or
6
dissents
on
the
section
61
point,
but
no
one
dissented
on
the
section
119
point.
judge
sterrett
wrote
a
dissenting
opinion
joined
by
five
judges
set
forth
at
pages
32
(a)
to
37
(a)
of
appendix
8
of
the
petition
which
said
that
--
which
concluded
that
the
amounts
were
not
gross
income
under
section
61.
he
did
not
reach
there
and
i
suppose
one
might
say
he
did
not
reach
the
other
point
although,
so
--
but
there
was
no
expression
of
disagreement
in
the
tax
court
under
section
119
point.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
proper
tax
treatment
would
seem
to
me
if
that
situation
would
be
as
follows,
the
judge
would
--
unless
there
were
complete
wash,
i
am
assuming
let
me
back
for
a
moment.
as
a
theoretical
matter,
all
those
payments
are
part
of
gross
income.
moreover,
the
amounts
expended
for
meals
when
away
from
home
overnight,
under
this
court?s
correll
decision
are
a
deductible
business
expense
under
section
162
of
the
code,
so
they
would
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
but
he
has
employee
business
expenses,
that
if
an
employee
is
away
from
home
overnight
and
expends
money
in
aid
of
his
business
which
is
the
business
of
being
an
employee,
those
expenses
are
deductible,
so
to
follow
through
on
your
example,
the
judge
would
include
all
of
these
per
diem
payments
in
income
and
take
corresponding
deductions,
it
may
well
be
given
the
high
cost
of
leaving
these
days
and
the
particular
plight
that
federal
judges
find
themselves
and
that
there
will
be
a
net
deficit
in
which
case
that,
there
will
be
a
net
deduction.
it
is
possible
if
the
judge
is
frugal
that
there
may
be
net
amount
of
income.
now,
the
internal
revenue
service
by
regulation
takes
the
position
that
if
an
employee
must
make
an
accounting
to
his
employer
and
there
is
a
complete
wash
you
do
not
have
to
report
the
actual
items
on
the
return,
but
you
must
append
the
statement
to
your
return
saying
that
you
have
had
per
diem
payments,
you
had
business
expenses
and
that
they
net
out
against
each
other,
so
this
enables
the
internal
revenue
service
to
be
alluded
to
the
fact
that
there
are
these
items
on
the
return
and
if
they
want
to
audit
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
would
--
i
do
not
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
without
making
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
you
have
never
put
the
statement
on
it.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
--
in
preparing
for
this
case,
i
have
been
advised
that
there
is
such
a
requirement.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
absolutely
not
--
i
think
its
a
--
i
do
not
think
it
is
a
mandatory
requirement,
it
is
a
conducive
requirement.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
suspect
probably
not
if
they
are
tax
free
and
that
is
--i
am
not
familiar
with
that
but
that
may
well
be
by
special
statute.
the
statute
authorizing
the
president's
salary
may
provide
for
a
tax
free
allowance,
very
much
like
the
military
has
certain
taxable
allowance
which
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
right.
getting
back
to
the
more
mundane
factual
context
in
which
this
case
arose
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
for
these
purposes,
we
are
all
tax
payers,
i
do
not
even
exclude
myself
from
the
circle
of
tax
payers.
this
respondent
is
a
new
jersey
state
police
trooper
and
in
1970
had
a
base
salary
of
$8,739.
he
received
an
additional
amount
which
the
state
designated
as
a
meal
allowance
which
for
1970
was
$1,697.
this
meal
allowance
was
like
the
salary
paid
biweekly,
but
unlike
the
salary
it
was
paid
in
advance
and
salary
was
paid
for
prior
periods.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
shall.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
shall.
this
meal
allowance
is
described
on
a
new
jersey
police
recruitment
brochure
as
in
item
to
be
received
and
in
addition
to
salary.
it
is
clearly
an
important
aspect
of
the
troopers
compensation.
the
amount
of
the
meal
allowance
is
a
subject
of
negotiations
between
the
police
troopers
union
and
the
state
and
in
fact
has
gone
up
over
the
years
that
used
to
be
$70
a
month
and
now,
it
ranges
from
$1,740
for
troopers
like
respondent
kowalski
$1,776,
for
lieutenants
and
captains,
and
$2,136
for
the
commander
of
the
new
jersey
state
police,
the
superintendent
colonel.
so
there
is
a
variation
in
amount
depending
upon
your
rank.
the
meal
allowances
are
also
significantly
included
in
the
compensation
base
on
which
the
troopers
pension
benefits
are
computed.
now,
under
the
cash
meal
allowance
system,
the
troopers
are
expected
to
eat
within
their
assigned
patrol
area,
and
so
what
they
have
to
do
as
and
when
they
are
going
to
go
to
lunch,
when
i
used
to
lunch,
i
am
really
talking
about
a
mid-shift
meal.
i
am
just
using
lunch
as
an
example.
they
have
to
check
in
with
the
officer
in-charge
and
tell
him
they
will
be
at
such
and
such
a
restaurant
and
they
will
be
there
for
the
lunch.
now,
there
is
no
restrictions
on
the
cash
payments
because
the
troopers
can
eat
at
home
if
they
wish,
if
they
leave
within
their
assigned
duty
area,
they
can
eat
in
a
public
restaurant
as
i
suggested,
or
they
can
even
take
their
lunch
or
take
a
sandwich
from
home
and
eat
in
their
patrol
car,
if
they
so
desire.
the
amount
of
the
meal
allowance
is
not
calculated
at
all
to
provide
any
kind
of
reimbursement
for
any
specific
amount
of
meals,
it
is
simply
a
flat
amount
per
year,
in
this
case
$1,740.
on
his
1970
return,
respondent
kowalski
reported
his
$9,000
in
wages,
which
included
a
base
salary
of
$8,739
and
cash
meal
allowances
of
$326.
now,
the
reason
he
reported
part
of
this
cash
meal
allowance
on
his
1970
return
is,
i
think
significant.
he
reported
it
because
the
state
of
new
jersey
in
october
1970,
that
is
for
the
final
quarter
of
this
taxable
year,
changed
its
policy
and
began
to
include
the
cash
meal
allowances
on
the
form
w-2
of
their
troopers,
so
the
internal
revenue
service
began
to
be
advised
formally
of
the
fact
that
these
troopers
were
receiving
these
additional
amounts.
but
respondent
kowalski
did
not
report
the
remaining
$1,371
portion
to
the
first
nine
months
of
1970
because
that
was
not
included
on
his
form
w-2.
the
only
reason
this
sort
of
came
to
the
internal
revenue
services
attention
and
in
one
respect
this
aspect
of
the
case
is
really
significant
for
purposes
of
the
second
case
because
it
shows
the
importance
of
the
need
for
the
internal
revenue
service
to
withhold
on
cash
payments
from
an
employer
to
employee
at
the
source,
but
the
reason,
the
internal
revenue
service
found
out
about
it,
is
because
that
they
disallowed
respondent
kowalskis
travel
expenses,
and
after
respondent
kowalski
filed
his
petition
of
the
tax
court
in
his
service,
filed
its
answer
and
began
to
engage
in
a
work
--
in
a
deeper
kind
of
discovery,
they
discovered
the
fact
that
he
had
this
additional
$1,371
by
happenstance
of
this
litigation
and
then
filed
an
amended
answer
which
raised
the
issue
which
is
before
the
court
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
i
am
not
suggesting
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
or
for
more
than
a
decade,
mr.
justice
blackmun
actually
since
on
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes
--
no
i
am
not
suggesting
that,
but
what
i
was
trying
to
emphasize
is
the
fact
that
the
withholding
requirements
are
very
important
and
we
will
address
this
in
greater
detail
in
the
central
illinois
case,
but
i
wanted
to
simply
say
that
the
withholding
requirements
are
very
important
to
the
service,
in
terms
of
insuring
that
taxes
are
collected
on
employee
compensation
because
basically
the
service
is
set
up
on
his
computers
that
it
would
treat
items
on
form
w-2
as
a
basic
compensation
of
an
employee
and
it
is
only
when
matters
are
going
to
audit,
like
this
case
that
you
have
the
happenstance
of
discovering
an
additional
amounts
that
are
not
reported
on
a
from
w-2
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
absolutely
not
--
absolutely
not
if
that
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
absolutely
not,
but
the
point
i
was
simply
making
is
that
when
something
is
not
on
a
from
w-2,
it
is
more
than
likely
that
the
service
in
the
normal
kind
of
tax
administration
absent
the
audit
is
not
going
to
be
aware
of
a
cash
payment
made
by
an
employer
to
employee.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
mr.
chief
justice
is
this
a
meal
in
kind
thats
provided
by
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
but
its
--
but
it
is
a
meal
provided
in
kind
by
the
employer
to
be
in
on
the
employees
business
premises.
i
would
think
that
that
would
be
covered
by
the
exclusion
of
section
119,
this
is
such
a
section
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
no,
because
section
119
says
it
is
not
gross,
in
other
words
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
except
for
119,
it
would
be
gross
income
because
section
61
(a)
begins
except
this
otherwise
provided
in
this
subtitle
and
this
subtitle
includes
section
119.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
would
not
be
a
meal
in
kind
provided
by
the
employer
and
they
would
be
paying
cash
for
this
meal.
in
other
words,
section
119
clearly
by
legislative
history
and
regulations
provide,
that
you
have
got
any
three
requirements.
number
1
-
it
must
be
a
meal
in
kind,
provided
by
the
employee,
number
2
-
it
must
be
for
the
convenience
of
the
employer
and
number
3
-
this
must
be
furnished
on
the
business
premises.
now,
in
your
example
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
suppose
it
would
be
for
the
convenience
of
the
employer
that
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
although,
i
suppose
it
would
be
a
debatable
question
whether
the
meal
were
furnished
on
the
business
premises,
if
you
had
to
go
to
a
public
restaurant
to
get
it,
but
i
think
--
i
think
that
it
would
not
meet
the
question
of
meal
in
kind
if
in
effect
you
are
getting
a
cash
payment
to
go
by
a
meal
in
a
restaurant
and
eat
it
and
the
statute
clearly
provides
you
got
to
meet
all
three
requirements
under
section
119,
otherwise
you
flunk
the
test.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
would
be
gross
income
because
he
would
not
meet
--
it
would
not
be
a
meal
in
kind
furnished
by
the
employer.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly
--
and
in
fact
that
is
really
what
happened
in
this
case
and
that
is
what
the
respondents
have
argued
because
the
state
of
new
jersey
used
to
have
a
meals
--
kind
of
meal
station
system
which
they
abandoned,
in
favor
of
this
cash
allowance
and
the
respondents
have
argued
here
that
and
throughout
this
case
that
because
it
was
done
on
a
meal
station
basis
before,
that
makes
the
cash
payments
non-taxable.
then,
we
basically
had
two
answers
to
this,
first,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
permits
an
inference
that
the
meal
station
allowance,
this
meal
station
system
of
former
days
would
have
been
nontaxable,
in
fact,
it
really
turned
out
to
be
the
inconvenience
of
the
employer,
because
the
state
of
new
jersey
found
that
people
were
driving
all
around
the
state
to
eat
their
meals
and
actually
turned
out
to
be
quite
far
from
their
duty
stations
and
our
second
answer
to
this
is
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
it
bears
on
the
tax
question
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
no
it
does
bear
on
the
tax
question
mr.
chief
justice
because
section
119
(1)
of
these
requirements
is
that
the
meals
be
furnished
for
the
convenience
of
the
employer
and
if
it
turns
out
as
i
am
suggesting,
that
the
meals,
it
turned
out
to
be
inconvenient
for
the
employer,
i
would
suggest
that
you
do
not
need
the
statutory
test,
but
putting
that
aside
for
a
moment
i
think
that
the
court
had
said
on
a
number
of
the
instances
in
national
alfalfa
or
central
tablet
manufacturing
company,
simply
the
fact
that
you
could
do
it
one
way
and
achieve
a
particular
tax
result,
does
it
mean
that
you
have
to
do
it
another
way
which
may
be
virtually
equivalent
from
a
surface
point
of
view
that
that
will
achieve
the
same
taxes.
now,
each
case
has
to
be
judged
on
its
facts.
now,
i
do
want
to
talk
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
so.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
they
get
an
hour
off
or
time
off
for
lunch
within
that
eight
hour
shift.
now,
it
is
possible,
it
may
be
a
nine
hour
shift
with
an
hour
for
lunch.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
now
they
are
allowed
to
--
they
can
basically
wherever
they
want
to
eat
lunch
essentially
it
is
just
as
if
my
employer
or
anyone?s
employer
simply
said,
here
we
are
going
to
get
in
$2
more
day
to
eat
lunch
and
we
simply
submit
that
those
cash
payments
are
tax
--
are
compensation
for
services
under
section
61
(a)
(1)
and
that
they
do
not
need
any
special
limited
exclusion
of
section
119,
which
congress
has
channeled
these
three
requirements
and
they
have
all
got
to
be
met.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
nothing
to
do
with
overtime
at
all.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
would
not
make
a
difference
in
our
view
because
that
restriction
might
and
that
basically
is
this
case
because
that
restriction
might
be
for
the
convenience
of
the
employer,
but
the
cash
payment
does
not
serve
the
convenience
of
the
employer.
the
employer
must
provide
the
meals
and
congress
has
said
so
specifically
that
in
the
committee
report
in
section
119,
and
reporting
it
out
that
this
provision
only
applies
to
meals
in
kind,
it
is
not
a
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
absolutely,
that
is
critical,
the
cash
aspect
that
it
is
critical
to
the
eligibility
under
section
119
and
we
submit
that
cash
payments
are
never
eligible
for
exclusion
under
section
119.
i
do
not
want
to
forget
to
turn
to
the
tax
treatment
of
the
military
as
justice
blackmun
asked.
the
military
have
always
been
a
special
case
under
the
tax
law
as
well
as
generally
i
think
this
court?s
decisions
indicate
that
military
have
been
treated
differently.
now,
the
origin
of
the
treatment
of
the
military
arose
in
the
jones
case
which
the
court
of
claims
decided
in
the
1920.
the
court
of
claims
decided
that
cash
allowances,
housing
allowances
to
the
military
would
not
be
taxable
income,
although
service
has
resisted
it
at
that
time,
that
after
the
jones
decision
the
service
changed
its
position.
that
cash
subsistence
payments
to
military
personnel
were
includable
in
gross
income
and
rule
that
such
allowances
would
not
include
the
gross
income.
now,
after
that,
that
position
of
the
internal
revenue
service
was
ultimately
found
its
way
into
the
regulations,
since
i
think
its
1.61-2
(b)
of
the
regulations.
so
following
the
jones
decision
this
service
the
treasury
has,
for
the
last
50
years
treated
in
military
quite
differently.
now,
during
this
last
50
years,
the
code
has
--
the
tax
law
has
been
codified
twice,
in
1939
and
in
1954
and
congress
was
aware
that
treasury
regulations
providing
for
the
special
treatment
to,
were
turned
out
to
be
not
just
the
military,
but
the
uniform
services
which
includes
the
coastal
and
geodetic
survey,
public
health
service
as
well
and
congress
never
expressed
any
opinion
that
this
was
not
be
the
governing
rule
and
in
fact,
in
37
u.s.c.
101,
which
we
quote
at
page
19
of
our
brief,
congress
explicitly
confirmed
the
understanding
that
regular
military
compensation
includes
?federal
tax
advantages
accruing
to
aforementioned?
is
in
subsistence
allowance.
now,
the
respondents
in
this
case
have
tried
to
make
much
of
the
fact
that
the
there
are
analogies
between
the
state
police
and
military,
but
quite
frankly,
we
think
that
congress
and
the
courts
and
the
treasury
have
for
the
last
half
century
treated
them
as
a
very
special
case,
and
in
fact,
the
legislative
evidence
is
all
to
the
contrary
because
the
congress
in
1954
enacted
section
120
of
the
code,
which
we
referred
to
briefly
in
our
brief
which
basically
provided
a
$5
a
day
exclusion
for
state
police
troopers
which
is
subsistence
allowance,
and
then
in
1958,
congress
repealed
that
for
very
much
the
same
reason
that
sort
of
underlays
our
position
in
this
case,
is
that
after
they
enacted
the
provision,
many
states
simply
said
allocated
part
of
the
compensation
of
state
police
troopers,
the
subsistence
allowance
as
even
though
that
was
not
the
intent
of
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
and
they
say
basically
worked
in
an
equity
that
they
gave
state
police
troopers
something
that
other
people
did
not
have,
so
it
repeal
19-120
and
1958
now,
if
somehow
there
is
an
exclusion
from
gross
income,
its
respondents?
contend
to
these
cash
payments,
then
the
whole
congressional
exercise
between
1954
and
1958,
it
is
really
a
nullity
and
we
submit
that
congress
knew
what
it
was
doing,
the
military
were
special
and
to
the
extent
it
addressed
the
problem
in
this
case.
it
focused
on
the
fact
that
and
ultimately
concluded
that
these
cash
payments
to
state
police
troopers
were
not
to
be
excluded
from
gross
income,
but
would
to
be
includable
in
that
sense.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it
does
not
have
any
bearing
on
this
case
mr.
justice
blackmun,
it
has
more
bearing
in
the
next
case,
but
let
me
simply
say
for
purposes
of
this
case,
section
162
dropped
out
of
this
case
by
the
time,
the
tax
--
after
the
tax
court
because
the
tax
court
had
held
that
part
of
these
cash
payments
to
respondent
kowalski
turned
out
to
be
deductible
by
him
because
for
some
of
the
time
he
was
away
from
home
overnight
and
to
that
extent
under
the
court?s
correll
decision
the
tax
court
afforded
him
a
section
162
deduction
and
we
have
not
appealed
that
aspect
of
the
decision
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
it
is
accordingly
not
before
the
court.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it
does
not
seem
to
me
that
we
are
talking
about
what
is
left
in
the
case
is
non-
overnight
meals
and
non-overnight
meals
are
not
deductible
under
the
court?s
correll
decision
which
approved
the
commissioner?s
overnight
rule.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
there
is.
i
alluded
to
it
briefly.
it
is
on
page
19
of
our
brief,
37
u.s.c.
101
(25)
defines
regular
military
compensation
as
including
the
federal
tax
advantages
accruing
to
the
aforementioned
allowances
because
they
are
not
subject
to
federal
income
tax,
congress
--
to
the
extent
that
congress
has
addressed
the
problem
it
confirmed
what
was
the
general
understanding
of
the
courts
and
the
pertinent
administrative
agency
that
these
amounts
--
subsistence
allowances
for
the
military
were
not
taxable,
and
as
i
suppose
in
setting
military
compensation,
congress
takes
that
federal
tax
advantage
into
account.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
absolutely.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
thank
you.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
just
have
a
couple
of
points
mr.
chief
justice.
the
respondent
has
suggested
that
there
is
this
non-statutory
convenience
of
the
employer
test,
which
somehow
suffuses
section
61
of
the
code
and
enables
him
to
exclude
these
cash
payments
from
gross
income,
but
even
assuming
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
that
there
is
such
a
test
and
we
do
not
think
that
there
--
we
think
that
that
test
has
now
been
channeled
exclusively
under
section
119,
but
even
assuming
that
he
is
right
that
there
is
such
a
test,
under
that
test
he
has
to
meet
two
qualifications
by
his
own
analysis.
he
has
to
demonstrate
that
these
amounts
were
non-compensatory
and
he
has
to
demonstrate
that
the
cash
payments
were
for
the
convenience
of
the
employer.
we
submit
that
he
would
meet
none
of
those
tests
with
respect
to
section
--
with
respect
to
his
own
analysis.
first
of
all,
with
respect
to
whether
the
amounts
were
compensatory,
he
relies
on
a
finding
of
the
tax
court
that
the
meal
allowance
was
not
intended
to
represent
an
additional
compensation,
but
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
opening
argument
that
is
a
slander
read.
that
finding
of
the
tax,
does
not
say
that
there
would
not
compensation,
it
simply
said
what
the
state
hoped
that
they
would
be
and
this
court
has
said
in
commissioner
v.
duberstein
that
what
the
parties
hope,
labels
put
on
things,
but
they
hope
the
tax
effect
will
be
is
irrelevant
for
purposes
of
what
the
objective
circumstances
are
and
in
fact
later
on
in
the
tax
court?s
opinion
on
page
13
(a)
they
say,
even
though
we
have
found
that
the
meal
allowance
was
not
intended
as
additional
compensation,
it
was
obviously
compensatory
to
a
trooper
to
the
extent
that
it
paid
for
food
which
he
otherwise
would
have
had
to
pay
for
some
other
source.
we
conclude
under
section
61
that
except
as
otherwise
provided
in
the
income
tax
law,
the
meal
allowance
received
by
petitioner
is
includable
in
his
gross
income.
now,
with
respect
to
the
convenience
of
the
employer,
we
submit
that
cash
payments
do
not
serve
the
convenience
of
the
employer
because
what
the
respondent
has
done
is
to
confuse
the
issue
by
attempting
to
talk
about
all
these
meal
restrictions
that
is
you
have
to
eat
within
the
patrol
area,
you
have
to
eat
within
a
certain
area,
but
the
point
is
he
has
not
explained
why
those
restrictions
have
anything
to
do
with
the
convenience
of
the
employer,
all
they
have
done,
in
other
words
if
as
mr.
justice
stevens
has
suggested
they
simply
paid
cash
as
they
did
and
did
not
call
it
a
meal
allowance.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
meal
restrictions
serve
for
the
convenience
of
the
employer,
but
the
fact
that
the
state
of
new
jersey
paid
cash
does
not
serve
for
the
convenience
of
the
employer,
we
submit
that
that
is
the
critical
question.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
would
qualify
under
section
119
as
meals
in
kind.
that
is
the
distinction
we
take
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
am
assuming
that
i
quickly,
implicitly
assume
that
the
patrol
car
would
be
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
he
eats
in
the
car.
