mr.
carl
b.
cordes
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
may
i
first
say
you
that
my
name
is
pronounced
cordes
sir.
mr.
carl
b.
cordes
before
i
start
my
main
argument
i
would
like
to
correct
two
factual
problems
that
i
have
with
mr.
smiths
statement.
in
response
to
a
question
from
mr.
justice
marshall,
mr.
smith
stated
that
these
troopers
work
an
eight
hour
a
day
and
have
a
lunch
break,
that
is
not
the
case
with
respect
to
the
new
jersey
state
troopers.
in
1970
they
slept
in
barracks
for
much
of
the
year
that
they
were
on
duty,
not
under
all
assignments,
but
on.
--
kowalski
himself
spent
eight
months
of
the
12,
in
barracks.
second
thing
i
would
like
to
say
that
mr.
smith?s
presentation
is
with
respect
to
the
initiation
of
withholding.
mr.
carl
b.
cordes
yes,
sir
it
is.
the
--
mr.
carl
b.
cordes
no
that
is
not.
that
is
not
an
issue
in
the
case,
no.
mr.
carl
b.
cordes
the
petitioner?s
argument
basically
comes
down
to
the
point
that
the
meal
allowance
is
income
because
there
is
no
statutory
exclusion
and
in
order
to
understand
how
this
case
fits
within
the
long
history
of
exceptions
from
gross
income,
several
crucial
facts
must
be
emphasized.
new
jersey
state
police
has
organized
long
military
lines
and
it
has
unlimited
statewide
jurisdiction
for
all
police
functions,
it
is
not
merely
a
highway
patrol.
for
more
than
25
years,
prior
to
july
01,
1949,
the
state
of
new
jersey
fed
its
troopers
at
meal
stations
located
throughout
the
state
at
the
expense
of
the
state.
by
1949
the
state
had
found
that
the
meal
station
system
was
no
longer
acceptable
because
it
took
the
troopers
away
from
their
police
duties
for
too
much
time,
therefore
in
1949,
the
state
abandoned
the
meal
station
system
and
instituted
the
meal
allowance
system
in
issue
in
this
case.
the
meal
allowance
system
was
instituted
by
the
state
for
the
benefit
of
the
state
and
meal
allowance
system
has
worked
well
for
the
state,
not
only
has
it
provided
the
state
and
the
public
with
better
police
protection,
but
it
also
has
been
proven
less
expensive
than
the
meal
station
system.
mr.
carl
b.
cordes
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
just
as
the
states
furnishing
of
meals
was
not
intended
to
represent
additional
compensation,
the
meal
allowance
as
the
tax
court
found
is
not
intended
to
represent
additional
compensation.
the
states
accounting
for
salaries
is
strictly
separated
from
its
accounting
for
meal
allowances
and
the
two
funds
are
never
mingled.
moreover,
just
--
mr.
carl
b.
cordes
it
seems
to
me
mr.
justice
stevens
that
if
you
have
a
system
that
itself
satisfies
the
test
and
you
switched
--
mr.
carl
b.
cordes
it
satisfied
the
test
in
the
beginning.
the
state
had
this
system
going
for
--
for
the
1929.
mr.
carl
b.
cordes
it
was
not
inconvenient
mr.
justice,
it
is
less
convenient.
mr.
carl
b.
cordes
which
was
also
convenient.
mr.
carl
b.
cordes
that
is
so.
mr.
carl
b.
cordes
definitely
either
of
them
would
satisfy
the
statute.
mr.
carl
b.
cordes
61.
mr.
carl
b.
cordes
would
not
be
within
61.
mr.
carl
b.
cordes
correct.
mr.
carl
b.
cordes
that
is
for
119.
mr.
carl
b.
cordes
yes,
it
is
the
only
case
that
reached
that
conclusion
with
respect
to
state
police
trooper.
mr.
carl
b.
cordes
cash
payment,
there
was
only
one
other
case,
involving
a
state
police
trooper
--
a
cash
payment
to
a
state
police
trooper,
prior
to
the
54
code
and
that
was
the
hyslope
case
which
was
decided
by
the
tax
court
in
very
brief
opinion
and
never
appealed
beyond
that
point.
the
jones
case
to
which
the
sg
referred
held
that
cash
payments
in
commutation
of
meals
and
quarters
to
an
army
officer
were
excluded
under
the
prior
version
of
section
61,
and
in
that
connection
the
fact
that
a
payment
is
made
in
cash
rather
than
kind
should
not
be
crucial
for
federal
income
tax
purposes
the
internal
revenue
code
or
the
tax
law
rather
provides
an
exclusion
from
gross
income
for
a
number
of
different
types
of
cash
payments
without
any
specific
statutory
exclusion
in
the
code.
the
meal
allowances
to
the
armed
services
is
authorized
for
tax
purposes
only
by
reg.
section
1.61-2
(b),
supper
money
paid
to
employees
who
work
overtime
is
excluded
from
gross
income
by
a
ruling
that
was
issued
by
the
internal
revenue
bureau
in
1920
and
has
not
been
modified
since.
social
security
benefits
or
excluded
from
gross
income
without
any
specific
statutory
section.
welfare
benefits
or
excluded
from
gross
income
without
any
specific
statutory
section
and
unemployment
compensation
itself.
it
is
excluded
from
gross
income
without
any
specific
statutory
section.
mr.
carl
b.
cordes
they
are
as
--
mr.
carl
b.
cordes
that
is
correct
and
as
was
the
case
with
the
military
tax,
and
that
was
not
to
originate
with
the
court?s
decision.
the
state
provides
the
same
--
the
troopers
with
the
same
meal
allowance
exactly
the
same
allowance,
every
trooper
gets
the
same
regardless
of
his
length
of
service
and
regardless
of
his
salaries,
their
salaries
do
increase
with
length
of
service.
mr.
carl
b.
cordes
and
regardless
of
whether
he
eats
or
not;
however,
we
have
a
stipulation
in
this
case
and
a
finding
by
the
tax
court
that
the
tax
payer
spent
at
least
the
amount
of
his
meal
allowance
for
meals
while
in
uniform
on
active
duty.
mr.
carl
b.
cordes
i
do
not
think
we
need
a
stipulation
on
that.
the
meal
allowance
is
not
calculated
to
provide
reimbursement
for
any
specific
number
of
meals,
but
it
is
rather
an
averaging
device
appropriate
to
the
policy
of
the
state
of
new
jersey,
of
rotating
its
troopers
among
various
assignments
to
give
each
trooper
a
broad
range
of
experience.
mr.
carl
b.
cordes
that
is
true.
mr.
carl
b.
cordes
that
is
true.
mr.
carl
b.
cordes
that
is
true.
mr.
carl
b.
cordes
no
claim
that
they
have
different
appetites;
however,
i
have
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
meal
allowances
in
the
military
services
also
increase
with
the
rank
and
appropriately
the
nature
of
the
duties
of
higher
officers
may
well
be
such
as
to
requirement
to
eat
more
expensive
places
than
the
troopers
have
to
eat
in
and
the
higher
officers
also
get
a
higher
uniform
allowance
because
their
uniform
is
more
elaborate.
mr.
carl
b.
cordes
most
of
these--
i
would
assume
so.
mr.
carl
b.
cordes
may
i
say
mr.
justice
it
is
not
crucial
to
my
case
that
the
meal
allowances
that
are
paid
to
the
superintendents
and
the
officers
are
excluded
from
gross
income.
mr.
carl
b.
cordes
i
can
only
ascribe
it
to
custom
justice
in
the
military.
mr.
carl
b.
cordes
what
i
am
saying
that
this
is
a
military
type
organization
and
it
is
very
similarly
patterned
to
the
military,
as
you
can
tell
from
the
titles
or
the
ranks
themselves
and
they
are
following
military
practice,
they
probably,
naturally
assume
that
officers
get
can
more
than
the
--
.
mr.
carl
b.
cordes
the
meal
allowances
for
meals
troopers
are
required
to
eat
while
they
on
active
duty,
they
are
on
active
duty
when
they
are
in
uniform
performing
their
official
duties.
they
are
on
active
duty
in
uniform
when
they
eat
the
meals
for
which
the
meal
allowance
is
paid.
they
must
obtain
permission
to
eat
and
their
meals
are
frequently
interrupted
by
the
demands
of
their
duties
and
mr.
chief
justice,
they
carry
radios
on
their
persons
which
enables
them
to
be
summoned
by
headquarters
when
they
are
eating
their
meal.
i
do
not
have
to
go
out
to
the
car
to
be
at
the
radio.
mr.
carl
b.
cordes
i
think
the
reason
that
the
meal
allowance
is
paid
is
that
they
are
on
duty
and
expected
to
be
functioning
when
they
are
eating
their
meals,
they
eat
on
the
run,
they
do
not
have
a
lunch
hour
--
mr.
carl
b.
cordes
it
does
not,
but
this
raises
a
question
that
the
government
has
raised
they
say,
it
may
well
be
convenient
for
the
troopers
to
have
their
meals
under
these
circumstances,
but
it
is
not
convenient
for
the
state
to
have
to
pay
for
the
meals,
if
that
is
the
case
it
seems
to
me
there
is
no
convenience
of
the
employer
doctrine
at
all,
even
within
the
context
of
section
119
because
for
any
employer,
it
is
more
convenient
to
have
something
done
in
the
way
he
wants
it,
and
not
have
to
pay
for
it.
mr.
carl
b.
cordes
that
does
happen
sometimes,
but
not
in
this
case
i
do
not
--
what
it
is
called
i
do
not
want
to
get
it
--
mr.
carl
b.
cordes
they
did
not
call
a
pay
they
called
it
a
meal
allowance
because
it
replaced
a
system
of
providing
meals
in
kind.
mr.
carl
b.
cordes
i
would
assume
so.
mr.
carl
b.
cordes
it
has,
the
troopers
union
was
organized
in
1968
and
the
meal
allowance
system
was
instituted
in
1949
and
the
mere
fact
that
it
is
a
part
of
the
collective
bargaining
negotiations,
i
do
not
think
affects
the
outcome.
mr.
carl
b.
cordes
because
it
is
a
--
mr.
carl
b.
cordes
certainly,
but
like
other
conditions
of
employment.
mr.
carl
b.
cordes
it
is.
it
is
--as
a
result
of
inflation
--
mr.
carl
b.
cordes
and
collective
bargaining
too
--.
mr.
carl
b.
cordes
and
the
economy,
and
the
salaries
are
higher
now
too.
almost
immediately
after
the
state
instituted
the
meal
allowance
system
in
1949,
the
revenue
service
challenged
it
in
the
saunders
case,
1950
case
where
the
facts
were
--
the
words
of
the
tax
court
in
this
case
not
substantially
different
from
those
in
this
case.
saunders
excluded
the
meal
allowance
under
the
predecessor
of
section
61
under
the
convenience
of
the
employer
doctrine
and
this
has
been
the
law
for
the
new
jersey
state
troopers
meal
allowances
always
under
the
meal
allowance,
under
the
meal
station
system,
they
did
not
pay
tax
on
it,
under
the
meal
allowance
system
they
have
never
paid
tax
on
it.
as
a
result
of
saunders
until
this
case
has
been
brought
again
by
the
government.
one
point,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
in
reaching
your
decision
is
the
equity
argument,
that
is
equal
treatment
among
tax
payers
who
are
similarly
situated,
i
myself
find
it
very
difficult
to
draw
a
distinction
between
military
officers
and
state
police
officers
who
were
working
in
a
state
police
department
that
functions
under
this
system
with
barracks
and
long
hours,
uniforms
not
being
a
mere
highway
patrol,
if
there
is
a
convenience
of
the
employer
doctrine
as
there
must
be,
if
the
military
pay
exclude,
if
military
meal
allowance
exclusion
is
to
be
a
valid
regulation,
judge
sterrett
here
in
this
--
in
the
tax
court
found
that
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
of
the
situation
where
an
employee
must
clearly
take
his
meals
for
the
convenience
of
the
employer
as
is
the
case
with
new
jersey
state
troopers.
mr.
carl
b.
cordes
mr.
justice,
i
think,
in
the
statute
that
mr.
smith
cited
i
think
all
that
congress
has
done
is
to
recognize
that
there
is
a
well-recognized
--
mr.
carl
b.
cordes
right
that
is
not
a
tax
statute
that
statute
just
says,
look,
the
revenue
boys
have
decided
this
and
so
that
is
the
way
we
will
treat
this.
it
is
not
part
of
the
tax
law?
mr.
carl
b.
cordes
it
is
a
congressional
recognition,
but
--
mr.
carl
b.
cordes
i
think
they
would
be
out
of
their
minds
if
they
try
to
do
it
at
this
point
yeah.
the
statutory
definition
of
income
itself
is
not
particularly
helpful.
the
section
61
of
the
code
simply
says
gross
income
means
all
income
from
whatever
source
derived,
so
it
is
defining
itself
within
itself
and
is
a
definition
therefore
if
a
language
is
defective
and
therefore
these
glosses
have
grown
up
on
the
statute
over
a
period
of
time
judicially,
administratively
and
of
course,
legislatively.
convenience
of
the
employer
doctrine
is
one
of
them.
it
is
not
the
only
one,
it
is
not
the
most
well
known
one,
but
it
is
there,
it
has
been
there
for
a
long
time
and
counsel
or
the
government
is
saying
that
if
you
have
a
cash
payment
you
cannot
possibly
come
under
the
convenience
of
the
employer
doctrine
and
to
reach
that
finding,
you
have
to
decide
that
all
cash
payments
are
income
and
it
is
clear
that
under
our
tax
system
all
cash
payments
are
not
income.
mr.
carl
b.
cordes
let
me
give
you
the
context
of
162
in
this
case,
in
the
tax
court,
we
briefed
the
162
question,
we
lost
the
case
in
a
tax
court
on
a
very
close
decision
on
appeal
we
briefed
all
three
question
section
61,
section
119
and
section
162.
the
court
of
appeals
in
reversing
the
tax
court
on
the
basis
of
saunders
and
judge
sterrett?s
dissenting
opinion
under
section
61
did
not
in
my
opinion
at
least,
reached
the
119
question
and
did
not
at
all
reach
the
162
question.
mr.
carl
b.
cordes
162
provides
a
deduction
whereas
the
other
two
provide
an
exclusion
--
mr.
carl
b.
cordes
from
income,
162
provides
is
a
deduction.
mr.
carl
b.
cordes
to
keep
my
judgment
below
i
certainly
would
rely
on
it.
mr.
carl
b.
cordes
i
must
say
to
rely
on
it,
limitations
would
have
to
be
put
on
the
scope
of
the
correll
case.
mr.
carl
b.
cordes
i
do
not
agree
with
mr.
smith
that
it
is
faded
because
although
the
government
--
what
the
tax
court
did,
was
to
allow
a
deduction
for
two
thirds
of
the
meal
allowance,
because
he
was
away
from
home
two
thirds
of
the
time.
the
government
did
not
appeal
from
the
allowance
of
the
two
thirds
deduction,
we
did
appeal
from
the
disallowance
of
the
one
third
deduction.
mr.
chief
justice,
unless
there
are
further
questions
i
have
completed
my
presentation.
