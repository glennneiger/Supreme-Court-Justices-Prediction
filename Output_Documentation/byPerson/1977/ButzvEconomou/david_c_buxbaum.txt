mr.
david
c.
buxbaum
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
factual
circumstances
surrounding
this
case
are
very
important.
i
should
point
out
that
this
case
was
decided
on
the
district
level
on
a
motion
to
dismiss.
there
was
no
discovering
in
this
case.
there
were
no
affidavits
attached
to
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
we
must
therefore
regard
the
allegations
and
the
complaint
as
being
true.
now,
the
factual
circumstances
are
these;
mr.
economou
had
long
been
in
the
commodities
business
as
a
member
of
one
of
the
more
established
exchanges
in
chicago.
he,
through
the
years,
had
come
to
some
conclusions
about
the
way
the
commodity
business
in
his
particular
area
was
being
run
and
he
felt
that
there
were
substantial
problems
of
the
commodities
industry
and
with
the
regulatory
agencies
that
were
regulating.
at
that
time,
the
regulatory
agency
was
the
commodity
exchange
authority
which
was
a
portion
of
the
department
of
agriculture.
he
made
it
known,
very
well
known
his
complaints
about
both
the
commodity
exchange
authority
and
about
the
industry
itself.
he
set
off
on
his
own
leaving
the
chicago
mercantile
position
that
he
had
and
establishing
his
own
exchange
registering
and
offering
with
the
security
and
exchange
commission,
registering
some
other
trading
organizations
with
the
security
and
exchange
commission,
preparing
to
register
his
exchange
known
as
the
american
board
of
trade
with
the
scc,
and
doing
a
number
of
other
things.
he
formed
an
organization
which
he
was
and
still
is
the
president
of,
called
the
american
association
of
commodity
traders
i
believe
and
this
was
designed
to
change
the
concepts
which
existed
in
the
commodities
business
at
that
time.
now
people,
and
this
is
all
alleged
in
the
complaint
and
also
in
the
affidavit
which
is
the
first
part
of
the
appendix,
people
in
the
industry
and
people
who
are
regulating
the
industry
took
umbrage
at
this
particular
activity
of
mr.
economou.
now,
it
so
happens
that
mr.
economou
was
not
the
only
person
pointing
--.
mr.
david
c.
buxbaum
how
we
know
they
did?
well,
one
of
the
reasons
we
know
they
did
is
because
the
actions
they
took
against
him
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
david
c.
buxbaum
we
certainly
have
alleged
it
and
which
it
must
be
deemed
as
true
for
the
purposes
of
this
particular
argument.
mr.
david
c.
buxbaum
well,
we
believe
we
have
more
evidence
than
that.
mr.
david
c.
buxbaum
yes,
i
would
think
so.
mr.
david
c.
buxbaum
that
is
my
point,
always
if
there
is
jurisdiction.
in
any
event,
as
i
say,
these
matters
were
published
as
a
matter
of
record
and
there
were
other
people
who
were
also
pointing
at
the
commodity
exchange
authority
in
the
way
the
commodities
business
was
being
regulated.
eventually
congress
did
away
with
the
commodity
exchange
authority
and
set
up
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission.
congress
itself
feeling
it
and
i
think
properly
so,
that
there
were
something
wrong
with
the
way
the
industry
was
being
regulated
at
that
time.
an
independent
agency
was
set
up
in
1974
parallel
to
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
which
now
regulates
the
commodities
business
in
a
different
way.
in
addition,
just
a
to
get
a
little
bit
technical
for
a
second,
mr.
economou
felt
that
it
was
too
big
a
spread
between
the
bidding
asked
price
on
the
various
exchanges
and
he
looked
to
eliminate
that
bidding
spread.
he
felt
that
they
should
be
a
specialist
on
the
floor
of
the
exchanges
as
they
are
on
the
securities
exchanges
to
make
an
orderly
market.
all
these
things
did
not
sit
well
as
we
alleged
in
the
complaint
with
the
industry
and
with
the
regulators.
now,
he
was
withdrawing
from
the
supervision
of
the
commodity
exchange
authority.
he
was
closing
out
his
business
and
was
no
longer
involved
in
this
particular
business
and
he
was
in
the
process
of
closing
out
his
accounts
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
closed
out
all
of
his
accounts
before
the
second
amended
complaint
came
down.
initially,
a
complaint
was
issued
claiming
that
he
was
under
financed
on
the
basis
of
new
regulations
that
had
been
issued
just
a
short
time
before
in
the
amount
of
several
thousand
dollars.
he
went
to
washington
and
elsewhere
asked
how
he
might
alter
this
situation
and
attempted
to
resolve
the
situation
by
meetings
with
washington.
he
received
no
help
whatsoever.
as
i
say,
he
was
in
the
process
of
liquidating
his
accounts
when
without
notice,
without
an
opportunity
to
be
heard,
without
anything,
his
complaint
came
down
alleging
that
his
business
was
deteriorating
at
rate
of
$4,000.00
a
month,
number
one
and
number
two,
providing
this
information
to
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
where
he
had
several
registrations
that
had
already
been
approved
and
some
that
were
pending.
in
essence
what
happened
is
that,
this
particular
announcement
had
appeared
in
the
press
and
by
the
way,
the
press
release
has
been
lost
by
the
petitioners
in
this
case
and
they
cannot
find
it
but
the
press
release
as
reflected
in
the
newspapers
which
we
do
have.
mr.
david
c.
buxbaum
well,
we
do
not
believe
that
to
be
the
case
your
honor,
we
believe
that,
that
particular
document
first
of
all
is
not
part
of
any
file
in
this
case.
it
was
made
a
part
of
the
appendix
over
our
objection
and
i
want
to
point
out
that
there
were
two
complaints
issued.
it
was
the
second
one
that
was
devastating
and
both
the
cover
sheet
and
whatever
was
attached
to
the
cover
sheet
has
been
alleged
to
be
missing
by
the
petitioners
in
this
particular
case.
it
does
not
exist.
that
was
what
we
have
been
informed
at
the
district
court
level.
now,
when
this
news
came
out
and
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
that
its
capital
was
being
lost
at
the
rate
of
$4,000.00
a
month
that
devastated
his
entire
business.
it
was
not
just
a
simple
matter.
he
proceeded
pro
se
up
the
ladder
to
appeal
this
decision
and
appear
himself
before
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
without
the
assistance
of
an
attorney
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
at
least
as
a
minimum,
since
there
was
admittedly
no
willfulness
involved
in
this
particular
case,
they
dismissed
it.
there
may
have
been
25
other
grounds
for
the
dismissal
also
but
they
said
since
it
did
not
meet
the
test
of
willfulness,
a
threshold
test,
therefore
the
entire
matter
was
dismissed.
in
the
hearings
that
were
held
by
the
way,
in
the
administrative
hearings
that
were
held
below,
the
petitioners
admitted
that
if
they
had
informed
mr.
economou
of
the
fact
that
they
were
going
to
come
down
with
this
particular
allegation,
that
he
would
have
and
all
likely
had
corrected
it
and
therefore
there
would
have
been
no
need
to
proceed.
in
addition,
it
was
admitted
in
one
of
the
administrative
hearings
that
the
statement
that
his
business
was
losing
a
capital
at
the
rate
of
$4,000.00
a
month
was
erroneous.
it
was
an
erroneous
statement,
a
very
substantial
and
harmful
erroneous
statement.
this
particular
action
as
has
been
explained
by
mr.
friedman
was
commenced
to
the
idea
of
attempting
to
state
these
administrative
proceedings,
and
as
generally
happens,
these
attempts
do
not
bear
fruit
because
the
courts
are
probably
quite
concerned
about
protecting
the
public
in
a
case
where
it
is
alleged,
that
a
firm
is
under
capitalized.
irrespective
of
the
fact
that
this
particular
firm
was
actually
just
liquidating
accounts,
still
the
courts
are
concerned
about
that.
mr.
david
c.
buxbaum
indeed,
ordinarily
could
not.
in
any
event,
this
attempt
i
supposed
was
made
at
a
time
and
hope
that
since
this
was
such
a
frivolous
matter
and
clearly
this
institution
was
withdrawing
from
the
business
and
clearly
that
it
had
no
further
jurisdiction
over
the
particular
respondent
in
this
particular
case
that
perhaps
this
court
would
stay
these
entire
proceedings.
in
fact,
of
course,
the
court
did
not
stay
the
proceedings
and
so
a
damage
action
was
instituted.
now,
as
anyone
in
the
securities
or
commodities
business
knows
when
you
receive
an
announcement
in
the
press
that
indicates
that
the
capital
of
firm
is
diminishing
at
a
rate
of
$4,000.00
a
month,
the
chances
of
your
continuing
in
business,
especially
small
firm,
among
the
members
of
the
industry
are
very,
very
selective.
the
allegations
in
the
complaint
to
get
to
the
question
of
jurisdiction,the
allegations
in
the
complaint
are
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
entire
proceedings
here
would
commenced
was
to
chill
the
speech
of
this
gentleman
who
was
athorn
in
the
side
of
the
commodity
exchange
authority
which
was
being
subject
to
other
criticism
at
the
time
also.
and
to
chill
his
freedom
of
speech
as
i
said
and
to
take
his
business,
to
destroy
his
business,
and
to
deprive
him
of
his
both
first
and
fifth
amendment
rights.
so
there
are
bivens-type
tort
claims
clearly
alleged
in
the
complaint
and
explicated
in
the
affidavit
that
is
in
the
first
part
of
the
appendix
which
was
prepared
by
mr.
economou
when
he
was
appearing
pro
se,
it
is
somewhat
lengthy
but
it
does
contain
numerous
essential
facts
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
david
c.
buxbaum
yes,
our
judgment
will
cover
a
million
dollars
if
that
was
the
judgment
that
was
eventually
granted.
mr.
david
c.
buxbaum
well,
if
we
presume
that.
mr.
david
c.
buxbaum
excuse
me?
mr.
david
c.
buxbaum
it
very
well
might.
it
might
shield
them
from
doing.
it
might
prevent
them
in
the
future
and
take
doing
the
wrong
thing.
mr.
david
c.
buxbaum
well,
i
do
not
believe
that.
mr.
david
c.
buxbaum
well,
i
would
say.
mr.
david
c.
buxbaum
i
would
say
this
that
it
is
beyond
per
venture
that
most
federal
officials
would
have
to
the
reasonable,
good
faith
immunity,
the
limited
immunity
of
reasonable
good
faith.
so
that
even
if
they
were
wrong,
if
they
behave
reasonably
in
a
good
faith,
they
would
be
immune
from
suit,
no
one
is
denying
them
that
immunity.
mr.
david
c.
buxbaum
i
do
not
know.
that
is
a
common
way
of
doing
it,
but
certainly
the
second
circuit
points
out
this
could
be
done
by
motion
for
summary
judgment.
and
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
gives
us
an
opportunity
,
there
has
been
no
discovery
in
this
case.
mr.
david
c.
buxbaum
well,
when
you
say
motion
for
summary
judgment
could
not
be
one
you
are
talking
about
by
the
petitioners,
i
take
it.
mr.
david
c.
buxbaum
while
if
the
petitioner
demanded
to
say
while
you
acclaim
that
this
was
a
conspiracy
to
deprive
your
client
of
his
constitutional
right
to
free
speech
and
to
take
this
property
without
due
process
of
the
law,
you
cannot
just
rely
upon
assertions
in
a
complaint
to
that
particular
point,
as
a
minimum,
it
would
be
our
responsibility
to
come
forth
with
some
evidence,
and
if
not,
the
court
would
certainly
so
was
it
was
a
frivolous
claim
the
court
--
mr.
david
c.
buxbaum
i
am
pointing
that
frivolous
claim.
the
only
thing
i
am
pointing
to
is
that
frivolous
claims
could
not
easily
sustain
a
motion
for
a
summary
judgment.
mr.
david
c.
buxbaum
well,
the
court
--.
mr.
david
c.
buxbaum
if
there
is
a
legitimate
dispute
on
the
evidence
yes,
of
course
the
court
would
say
that.
mr.
david
c.
buxbaum
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
way
the
immunity
law
now
exist
that
--first
of
all,
i
do
not
believe
we
should
create
a
what
jurors
call,
a
new
class.
i
do
not
believe
that
federal
officials
should
be
different
than
anyone
else
in
society.
i
think
there
are
important
decisions
of
this
court
recently
that
indicate
that
everyone
in
the
united
states
is
subject
to
the
law
of
the
united
states.
i
think
these
are
matters
that
should
be
and
must
be
accorded
due
respect.
mr.
david
c.
buxbaum
prosecutors
and
judges--
mr.
david
c.
buxbaum
prosecutors
and
judges
and
legislators
are
in
part
pursuant
to
the
constitution,
in
part
pursuant
to
the
rulings
of
this
court
in
the
areas
in
which
they
operate,
where
they
require
discretion
in
order
evaluate
either
facts
or
law
and
come
down
with
a
decision
rightfully
we
believe
immune
from
suit.
but
if
they
act
out,
there
is
recent
case
for
this
court
has
granted
cert
where
a
judge
i
understand
from
my
readings
permitted
sterilization
of
someone
when
he
had
no
statutory
authority
to
do
so
with
notice
and
ex-party
basis,
without
informing
the
person
that
they
were
to
be
sterilized.
the
operation
took
place
and
the
person
found
out
about
it
a
number
of
years
later.
now
that
sort
of
thing,
it
would
seem
to
would
not
--
mr.
david
c.
buxbaum
that
is
not
a
precedent,
this
court
has
granted
a
certiorari
in
that
particular
case.
mr.
david
c.
buxbaum
no,
even
if
it
was
flourishing
in
full
vigor,
i
would
not
concede
that
a
dismissal
would
be
appropriate
in
this
case.
first
of
all,
there
had
been
no
hearings;
there
was
no
factual
information
on
that
exact
scope
of
activity
of
any
of
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
all
we
have
is
one
affidavit
that
was
filed
long
before
the
motion
to
dismiss
had
no
connection
with
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
not
referred
to
in
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
we
had
never
had
a
chance
to
challenge.
so
i
would
say
we
do
not
know
what
the
activities
of
the
petitioners
were
in
this
case,
number
one.
number
two,
my
reading
of
barr
versus
matteo
is
somewhat
different
from
that
petition
of
the
petitioners.
i
do
not
think
barr
and
matteo
as
some
people
have
alleged
grants
all
federal
officials
immunity
from
suit
providing
they
are
operating
in
the
outer
sphere
of
their
authority.
i
do
not
think
that
is
the
proper
reading
of
barr
and
mateo.
i
think
what
it
does
say
is
that
immunity,
full
immunity,
total
immunity
is
not
only
to
be
granted
to
highest
ranking
federal
officials,
not
only
members
of
cabinet
rank,
but
it
can
also
be
granted
to
other
officials
in
policy
making
positions,
who
need
such
immunity
so
that
when
they
make
policy,
they
can
clearly
in
this
discretionary
area
make
policy
free
of
some
belated
quarterback,
second
guessing
them
as
to
the
policy
they
made.
i
think
that
it
what
barr
and
mateo
say.
i
do
not
think
it
said
that
everyone.
mr.
david
c.
buxbaum
barr
and
mateo
did
not
involve
constitutional
rights
here.
mr.
david
c.
buxbaum
well
that
is
not
our
claim
under
the
fifth
amendment.
our
claim
under
the
fifth
amendment
in
addition
to
that
had
been
taking
a
property
without
due
process
of
the
law.
mr.
david
c.
buxbaum
well,
in
essence.
mr.
david
c.
buxbaum
well,
not
a
hearing
that
we
alleged
was
a
state
hearing
which
everything
had
been
pre-determined?
mr.
david
c.
buxbaum
it
seems
to
me
it
is
a
little
of
both
because
i
think
the
press
release
which
may
not
have
been
within
the
authority
at
any
way
that
the
officer
release
it,
alleging
a
false
fact
which
was
later
admitted
to
be
false
namely
that
the
business
was
depreciating
at
rate
of
$4,000.00
per
month
was
enough
in
those
circumstances
to
destroy
the
business.
mr.
david
c.
buxbaum
i
think
it
is
completely
analogous.
mr.
david
c.
buxbaum
right.
mr.
david
c.
buxbaum
right.
mr.
david
c.
buxbaum
no,
but
i
do
not
think
that
is
our
only
allegation.
mr.
david
c.
buxbaum
no,
i
do
not
think
it
stands
at
all.
i
really
have
to
think
of
that.
i
do
not
think
it
stands
at
all
on
force
of
bivens.
but
i
think
there
should
be
no
distinction.
we
would
argue
between
deprivation
of
first
amendment
rights
and
i
would
point
to
the
most
recent
case
of
dellums
versus
powell
and
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
colombia
were
in
first
amendment
rights
were
clearly
violated
and
which
bivens-type
suit
did
proceed
and
fourth
amendment
rights.
i
think
all
rights
under
the
constitution
which
are
under
the
first
ten
amendments
in
which
an
individual
can
be
harmed
could
give
rise
theoretically
to
a
bivens-type
tort
and
i
do
not
think
this
court
should
differentiate
fourth
amendment
from
first
to
fifth
amendment
rights.
mr.
david
c.
buxbaum
if
we
could
not
prove
that
no.
mr.
david
c.
buxbaum
well,
we
still
think
we
have
a
case
in
the
barr
vs.
matteo.
we
think
we
have
a
bivens
case
also,
bivens-type
tort
under
the
taking
of
property,
the
fifth
amendment,
lack
of
due
process
hearing
and
fifth
amendment
taking
a
property
through
an
essence
that
this
press
release
which
an
essence
destroy
the
business
or
helped
to
damage
the
business.
mr.
david
c.
buxbaum
i
did.
i
do
think
so,
yes.
mr.
david
c.
buxbaum
yes,
i
suppose
too.
mr.
david
c.
buxbaum
well,
let
me
say
this
i
think
that
--
mr.
david
c.
buxbaum
i
would
say
this.
i
think
that
scheuer
versus
rhodes
did
modify
and
can
very
well
be
read
to
modify
barr
versus
matteo.
i
think
it
can
and
should
be
read
and
i
do
not
think
that
scheuer
should
only
be
held
to
apply
to
1983
cases.
i
think
there
should
be
a
standard
uniform
policy
with
regard
to
both
state
and
federal
officials.
i
think
that
the
petition
has
made
a
good
argument
that
1983
was
enacted
by
congress
for
specific
purposes.
i
think
that
when
it
was
enacted
it
was
understood
and
expected
that
federal
officials
would
be
restrained
by
the
first
ten
amendments
to
the
united
states
constitution
and
there
would
indeed
be
potential
recovery
against
federal
officials,
should
they
breach
the
civil
rights
of
citizens?
mr.
david
c.
buxbaum
well,
when
you
say
there
would
have
been
no
claim
i
think
there
were
claims
made
against
federal
officials.
i
think
it
is
going
back
as
far
as
us
versus
lee,
there
were
claims
made
against
federal
officials.
certainly
the
bivens-type
situation
had
not
been
clearly
enunciated
by
this
court.
i
think
there
were
expectations
when
1983
was
enacted
and
there
has
been
no
counterpart
on
the
federal
side
because
i
do
not
think
that
the
congress
felt
it
would
be
necessary
to
enact.
i
think
it
assumed
that
number
one;
that
federal
officials
would
not
do
these
things
--
.
mr.
david
c.
buxbaum
yes.
mr.
david
c.
buxbaum
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
c.
buxbaum
well,
we
have
asked
that
it
be
overturned
in
our
brief.
mr.
david
c.
buxbaum
no,
we
did
not
cross
petition.
we
have
in
our
brief
before
the
court
raised
that
issue
and
i
wish
to
point
to
a
recent
decision
that
is
referred
to
by
the
petitioners
in
this
particular
case
where
in
the
expeditions
unlimited
versus
smithsonian
where
in
judge
rookie's
concurring
opinion,
he
states
that
there
are
some
serious
question
if
they
had
to
review
the
issue
ab
initio
as
to
whether
or
not
these
smithsonian
which
we
regard
as
a
federal
institution
was
amenable
to
suit,
but
under
those
circumstances
he
would
have
to
reconsider
the
whole
matter
in
view
of
the
legislative
history.
it
has
been
said
that
historically
the
concept
of
the
sovereign
immunity
which
had
been
recognized
by
this
court,
and
by
others
was
something
that
should
not
have
been
made
part
of
our
heritage
from
our
english
brethren
in
a
sense
that
at
some
of
the
earlier
cases
have
said
the
people
were
presumably
sovereign
in
the
united
states
of
america.
there
was
no
sovereign
and
there
was
no
sovereign
to
grant
the
petitioner,
right.
and
as
such
it
was
error
from
the
inception
to
grant
sovereign
immunity
to
the
federal
government.
that
has
been
said
and
that
i
have
realized
that
all
that
is
gone
since
the
initial
time
till
today,
it
is
a
difficult
argument
to
sustain.
but
i
think
there
is
something
to
be
said
for
considering
that
particular,
your
honor.
i
think
that
it
is
interesting
that
the
expedition
unlimited
case
that
makes
reference
to
the
economou
case
and
it
finds
the
second
circuit
its
decision
not
in
accord
with
its
feeling
however
if
the
separate
opinions
are
read,
i
think
the
separate
opinions,
the
concurring
opinions
indicate
that
there
is
very
serious
doubt
in
the
minds
of
at
least
three
of
the
justices
in
the
district
court
of
columbia
as
to
whether
or
not
barr
versus
matteo
has
the
same
vigor
as
it
did
in
view
of
the
decision
in
scheuer
vs.
rhodes.
it
is
our
feeling
at
any
rate
that
barr
versus
matteo
does
not
grant
immunity
to
all
federal
officials
irrespective
of
their
positions
and
their
activities
but
only
to
those
requiring
having
policy
making
position
enacting
within
the
scope
of
their
authority.
it
seems
to
me
that
others
are
very
well
protective
by
a
good
faith
reasonable
defense
to
suit.
i
want
to
point
out
that
individuals
in
--
mr.
david
c.
buxbaum
no,
it
does
not
but
--
mr.
david
c.
buxbaum
that
is
a
serious
problem
your
honor
and
yet
people
in
private
life
and
private
industry,
they
are
subject
to
suit
and
it
does
not
prevent
them
from
acting
vigorously
in
corporate
activity
outside
directors
of
corporations
have
been
subject
to
more
vigorous
suit.
questions
at
disclosure
had
been
raised
to
a
new
level
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
among
corporate
officers
and
corporate
officers
are
subject
to
greatest
scrutiny.
people
in
the
commodities
and
securities
business,
not
only
are
they
subject
to
suit
individually
under
10b5
for
their
own
wrongdoing
but
for
failure
to
supervise
under
the
new
york
stock
exchange
laws
and
under
the
laws
in
nasd.
private
individuals
and
private
industry
are
subject
to
suit
and
they
seem
to
be
able
to
vigorously
carry
out
their
activities.
why
not
federal
officials?
why
should
they
be
any
less
subject
to
suit
provided
that
they
are
given
a
good
faith
reasonable
immunity,
so
when
they
act
in
good
faith
and
reasonably,
they
will
not
be
subject
to
harassing
suits?
it
seems
to
me
that
there
should
be
indeed
a
balance
between
private
world
and
the
public
world
of
government.
i
think
in
view
of
the
broadening
responsibilities
of
private
individuals
in
business
that
government
and
federal
officials
act
wrongfully.
i
might
point
out
that
there
has
been
tremendous
growth
of
federal
bureaucracy
if
you
want
to
use
that
word
and
of
other
government
and
it
is
alleged
that
there
is
a
feeling
among
people
that
they
have
lost
control
over
these
bureaucratic
institutions.
they
do
not
know
how
to
relate
to
them
and
if
they
feel
they
are
wrong
and
that
they
have
a
right
to
suit,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
help
to
bring
legitimacy,
the
kinds
of
legitimacy
to
government.
mr.
david
c.
buxbaum
that
is
true
except
that
most
of
these
allegations
where
there
are
suits
against
federal
officials
or
allegations
that
the
official
is
acting
in
a
private
and
a
narrow
way
rather
than
in
a
public
way,
that
is
the
allegation.
