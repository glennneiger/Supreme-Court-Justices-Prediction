justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
friedman
excuse
me
for
interrupting
you
so
soon
but
you
say
it
is
a
damage
suit
growing
out
of
an
administrative
proceeding.
did
the
government
ever
question
the
basis
of
the
district
court's
federal
jurisdiction
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
not
that
put
us
in
something
of
an
awkward
position
and
that
we
are
asked
to
rule
on
defense
on
the
merits
where
in
fact
there
might
be
no
federal
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
i
asked
you
what
the
jurisdiction
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
think
any
of
them
is
sustainable?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
terms
of
this
jurisdiction,
not
whether
they
stated
the
cause
of
action
or
some
of
those
--
is
any
of
them
sustainable?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
suspect
probably?
justice
byron
r.
white
sort
of
the
bivens
type
of
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
diversity
jurisdiction.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
a
federal
question
type
of
suit
too
is
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
is
the
federal
question
in
a
case
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
in
the
motion
to
dismiss,
no
one
ever
moved
to
dismiss
for
want
of
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
in
the
separate
proceeding
from
this
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
complaint
was
filed
then
while
review
was
either
pending
or
open
on
administrative
review
in
the
second
circuit.
justice
byron
r.
white
where
is
that
in
the
appendix
if
you
have
it
right
at
hand
mr.
friedman?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
the
press
release.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
friedman,
in
barr,
did
the
court
indicate
that
the
absolute
immunity
came
up
with
there
would
apply
to
actions
outside
the
scope
of
authority?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
interpret
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
if
he
has
to
be
doing
the
kind
of
thing,
does
he,
that
he
is
authorized
to
do
under
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
it
turns
out
later
that
the
court
decides
that
he
had
no
authority
whatsoever
to
do
it,
he
just
made
a
mistake?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
so
it
does
not
have
to
be
within
the
scope?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
the
kind
of
thing
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
say
if
it
had
been
decided
in
the
case
that
an
official
had
no
authority
to
a
certain
act
under
a
statute
and
in
the
next
time,
he
did
it
anyway,
knowing
that
he
had
no
such
authority?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
no
absolute
immunity
and
no
immunity
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
a
complaint
alleges
that
he
entered
this
person
knowing
that
he
had
no
authority
into
the
statute
to
act
as
he
did?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
the
allegation
is
he
did
it
maliciously
in
the
sense
he
knew
he
was
acting
beyond
the
scope
of
his
authority.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
my
case
then
where
he
alleges,
it
was
held
last
year
that
he
had
no
such
authority
and
yet
he
did
it
anyway
knowing
that
he
did
not.
could
you
say
that
he
could
stay
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
the
allegation
is
that
he
knew
he
did
not
have
the
authority.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
was
just
trying
to
find
out
what
the
content
was
of
barrâ€™s
rather
careful
indication
that
the
officer
must
be
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
authority
and
that
it
was
a
very
close
question
in
the
barr
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
friedman
may
i
ask
the
question
here.
do
you
suggest
that
we
look
at
each
of
the
defendant
separately?
now
some
of
the
defendants
you
did
not
quite
to
were
auditors
rather
that
the
higher
ranking
people.
in
some
areas,
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
positions
of
a
prosecutor,
say
and
a
police
officer,
one
gets
absolute
immunity,
the
other
gets
qualified
immunity.
do
you
think
that
distinction
might
apply
to
the
difference
between
an
auditor
and
a
hearing
examiner
for
example
or
lawyer
trying
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
apply
the
same
rule
to
an
agent
who
is
an
accountant
by
training
who
is
investigating
a
business
crime
or
an
auditor
for
internal
revenue
investigating
the
financial
background
of
the
possible
tax
prosecution,
would
those
auditors
be
like
fbi
agents
and
police
or
like
the
auditor
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
friedman,
does
it
make
any
difference
in
your
argument
that
here
there
was
an
administrative
review
proceeding
open
to
the
respondent
after
these
government
officials
had
performed
their
tasks
in
which
he
could
challenge
their
conclusions
as
opposed
to
barr
against
matteo
and
howard
against
lyons
or
if
they
did
not
get
their
relief
in
the
independent
judicial
suit
there,
apparently
they
would
not
get
it
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
you
think
that
would
meet
the
problems
that
judge
learned
hand
was
raising
in
the
biddle
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
friedman,
how
about
the
investigator,
i
mean,
the
government
agencies
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
authority
as
you
understand
it
to
for
example
make
arrest
without
warrants
or
in
unusual
circumstances
making
searches
without
warrants,
he
just
happens
to
make
a
mistake?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
these
are
government
officials;
he
has
a
great
deal
of
discretion?
justice
byron
r.
white
1983
is
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
with
the
federal
investigation,
i
thought
you
indicated.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
there
is
some
line
somewhere
in
the
federal
hierarchy
that
there
is
no
absolute
immunity
at
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
pretty
broad
discretion?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
all
have
savings?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
may
all
have
savings?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
witnesses
maybe
absolutely
immune
for
their
testimony?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
auditors
might
have
been
witnesses
that
are
absolutely
immune
for
that
but
they
also
were
investigators,
were
they
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
that
role
are
they
more
like
federal
bureau
of
investigation
or
a
police
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
discussed
briefly
casually
but
did
not
take
it
much
further,
this
analogy
between
at
least
some
of
these
defendants
and
prosecutors.
in
footnote
8,
i
think
that
judge
mansfield's
opinion
from
the
court--
.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
that
immunity
would
not
even
if
stretched
to
its
limits
would
not
cover
every
one
of
these
defendants?
would
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
by
various
(inaudible)
generally?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
friedman,
in
this
case,
deprivation
of
the
constitutional
rights
are
alleged,
this
is
not
true
in
barr.
do
you
think
this
makes
a
difference
in
the
resolution
of
the
case
in
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
before
you
said
they
always
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
is
a
factual
distinction
between
the
two
complaints?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
we
must
take
that
as
though
as
true?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
--
you
were
denied
procedure
or
is
that
a
condemnation
type
of
claims?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
is
nothing
that
a
hearing
would
have
remedy.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
then
it
is
in
effect
a
fair
hearing
claim
rather
than
an
eminent
domain
claim
that
you
make
under
the
fifth
amendment.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
1983
was
enacted
now,
neither
then
nor
since
has
there
been
a
federal
counterpart
in
1983.
and
when
1983
was
enacted
there
was
not
even
any
arising
under
jurisdiction
that
was
not
an
act
until
1875,
so
when
1983
was
enacted
clearly
there
would
have
been
no
claim
against
any
federal
official
under
the
existing
laws
in
united
states.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
buxbaum,
just
a
trivial
question,
you
were
dismissed
also
as
to
the
department
of
agriculture
itself?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
commodity
exchange
authority?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
asked
that
that
be
overturned?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
when
a
private
individual
is
deterred
from
acting
by
the
threat
of
a
suit,
he
is
only
deterred
in
pursuit
of
his
own
private
interest
where
as
if
a
government
official
is
deterred
from
enforcing
some
governmental
policy,
he
is
conceivably
deterred
from
acting
in
a
way
that
would
benefit
a
great
number
of
people.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
case
is
here
on
the
certiorari,
from
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
it
involves
a
suit
against
various
department
of
agricultural
officials
for
they
are
having
suspended
the
registration
of
a
commodity
futures
trading
company.
the
officials
sued
ranged
from
the
secretary
of
agriculture
as
down
to
the
hearing
officers
and
investigating
officials
that
were
involved
in
the
suspension
proceedings.
and
the
claims
made
against
them
included
claims
that
they
had
deliberately
violated
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
plaintiffs
in
the
course
of
the
suspension
proceedings.
all
of
the
officials
claim
that
under
barr
against
matteo,
a
case
decided
here
some
years
ago.
that
they
were
absolutely
immune
from
damages
liability.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
however
held
that
under
cases
decided
here,
since
bar,
that
the
officials
were
not
entitled
to
absolute
immunity,
but
only
to
a
qualified
immunity.
we
brought
the
case
here
and
we
have
concluded
that
we
don't
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals,
but
we
don't
agree
with
the
petitioners
either.
some
of
these
officials
are
entitled
absolute
immunity
and
some
aren't.
we
have
filed
an
opinion
which
attempts
to
set
down
the
considerations
that
go
into
deciding
the
degree
of
immunity
that
these
officials
may
enjoy
and
the
bottom
line
is
that
we
make
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
the
principles
set
down
in
the
opinion.
but
again
all
is
not
harmony
here.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
the
chief
justice,
mr.
justice
stewart
and
mr.
justice
stevens
have
joined
him.
