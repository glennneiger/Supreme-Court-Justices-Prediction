if
you
apply
learned
hand’s
test
though
do
you
not
come
up
with
a
somewhat
different
answer
to
my
brother
mr.
white’s
question
because
you
say
it
is
alleged
in
all
of
these
cases
that
he
knew
he
did
not
have
the
authority?
and
i
would
think
that
the
teaching
of
learned
hand
in
gregoire
against
biddle
is
that
it
is
something
you
ought
not
to
have
to
try
out
every
time.

his

justice

mr.
friedman,
now
that
i
have
interrupted
you,
may
i
ask
a
couple
other
questions?
i
think
perhaps
the
answer
to
my
question
is
self-evident.
the
question
is
who
defends
federal
officials
when
they
are
sued
in
cases
like
this?
and
i
suppose,
the
answer
is
by
your
presence
here
that
the
government
of
united
states
does.
justice

the
pay?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
this
is
done
at
government’s
expense,
by
the
government
or
government’s
expense?
if
there
were
no
immunity
and
there
were
a
judgment
against
the
officials
based
upon
malicious
action,
who
would
pay
the
judgment?
justice
potter
stewart
generally,
then
as
a
general
rule,
there
will
be
no
indemnification?
justice
potter
stewart
by
the
government
employer?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
friedman
you
have
relied
on
this
specifically
on
barr
against
matteo.
there
is
one
other
class
of
government
officials
who
has
been
established
have
absolute
immunity
from
civil
liability
and
that
is
prosecutors.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
there
is
a
sufficient
analogy
between
at
least
some
of
these
defendants
and
prosecutors
to
bring
them
under
the
umbrella
of
that
doctrine?
