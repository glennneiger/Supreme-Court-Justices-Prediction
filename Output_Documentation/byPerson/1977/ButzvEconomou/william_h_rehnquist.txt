justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
ordinarily,
you
could
not
go
to
court
in
a
separate
action
could
you
and
challenge
an
administrative
determination
where
the
statute
authorizing
the
agency
to
make
that
determination
provided
for
judicial
review
like
was
available
in
the
second
circuit
hearing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
that
something
you
prove
after
a
jury
trial
where
you
have
been
de-posed
for
few
days
in
that
sort
of
thing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
how
can,
i
would
think
under
normal
rules
of
summary
judgment,
if
you
simply
allege
that
you
are
in
good
faith
and
you
are
the
party
that
has
the
burden
of
proof
on
that
issue,
you
could
not
win
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
on
that
basis,
any
sensible
district
court
would
say,
you
go
to
trial
on
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right!
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
does
not
go
to
the
defense
at
all.
that
goes
to
your
ability
to
sustain
against
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
motion
to
get
you
out
of
court
on
a
merit.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
that
point
counsel,
do
you
think
the
reasoning
of
the
courtâ€™s
bevins
decision
would
necessary
carry
over
to
give
you
a
claim
under
the
fifth
amendment
based
simply
on
a
claim
of
denial
procedural
due
process?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
your
strictly
procedural
fair
hearing
claim
is
completely
analogous
to
the
bivens
claim?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
if
bivens
was
fourth
amendment,
you
have
a
first
amendment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
have
a
first
amendment
and
your
denial
of
free
of
speech?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
bivens,
the
court
held
there
was
an
implied
basis
for
jurisdiction
under
1331
where
there
was
a
fourth
amendment
violation.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
a
procedural
fair
hearing
deprivation
under
the
fifth
amendment
stands
on
all
force
with
the
bivens
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
had
realized
you
made
a
number
of
other
allegations.
i
was
inquiring
about
that
one.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
bivens
certainly
depended
on
the
existence
of
arising
under
jurisdiction
under
section
1331
which
did
not
exist
at
the
time
1983
was
around.
