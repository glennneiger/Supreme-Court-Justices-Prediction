mr.

i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief

warren
e.
burger
now
you
said
mr.
friedman
you
thought
you
suspect
that.
one
or
more
of
these
several
that
are
cited
may
afford
a
basis
for
jurisdiction?
can
you
suggest
one,
that
you
suspect?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suspect
mr.
friedman
that
the
dialog
continues
that
may
well
develop
to
be
the
case
but
we
will
affirm
that
up
to
the
end
of
the
argument?
chief

e.

by

previously

chief

e.

mr.
friedman,
let
me
ask
you
just
one
question
here
at
the
end,
it
sounds
very
specific.
would
you
see
some
analogy
between
judge
handâ€™s
expressions
that
were
alleged
to
that
you
have
mentioned
and
philosophically,
and
the
approach
in
the
criminal
law
of
strict
rules
of
evidence
and
the
strict
enforcement
of
constitutional
guarantees?
under
that
broad
rubric,
but
it
is
better
to
have
a
hundred
guilty
men
go
free
than
one
innocent
man
to
be
found
guilty.
is
there
some
relationship
between
these?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
buxbaum.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
alleged
in
the
complaint
and
we
assume
it
is
true.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
thought
the
release
was
on
page
150
of
the
appendix?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
counsel,
it
has
been
suggested
to
you
before
that
does
not
protect
him
from
being
sued.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
this
is
what
judge
harlan
was
concerned
about
and
what
the
biddle
case
was
concerned
about
that
being
exposed
to
the
jeopardy
in
a
civil
sense.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice

e.

the
judgment
and
opinion
of
