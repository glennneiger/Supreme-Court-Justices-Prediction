mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
which
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
is
a
damage
suit
seeking
$32
million
against
various
officials
of
the
department
of
agriculture
growing
out
of
an
administrative
proceeding,
they
conducted
under
the
commodity
exchange
act.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
mr.
justice
because
the
fact
of
this
case
is
that
complaint
which
filed
and
there
was
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
grounds
of
immunity.
there
has
been
no
answer
filed
on
this
case
yet
and
all
of
those
questions
are
open
under
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
our
position
is
that
this
case
was
properly
dismissed
at
the
outset.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
the
problem
mr.
justice
is
the
district
court
dismissed
this
suit
and
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
dismissal
saying
that
the
immunity
in
this
case
was
not
what
the
district
court
held
and
therefore
as
the
case
now
stands
it
goes
back
to
the
district
court
to
consider
these
other
issues
and
we
have
brought
the
case
here
because
we
think
the
threshold
ruling
on
immunity
was
erroneous.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
the
jurisdiction
was
asserted
under
a
large
number
of
different
sections
in
the
complaint.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
am
not
certain
of
that.
some
of
them
it
seems
to
me
are
clearly
not
sustainable.
their
allegations
of
violation
of
constitutional
rights
are
claim
of
an
implied
right
of
action
for
violation
of
the
first
and
fifth
amendments
are
claims
relating
to
the
federal
jurisdiction.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
suspect
probably.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
because
it
is
in
sense
similar
to
many
of
these
cases
which
have
brought
suits
against
government
officials
for
damages
based
upon
their
actions
taken
in
performance
of
their
duty.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
suggest
this
is
not
the
bivens
type
of
suit
because
that
in
fact
involved
a
constitutional
claim.
this
has
some
constitutional
allegations
but
basically
we
think
this
is
comparable
to
a
suit
for
malicious
prosecution
and
defamation.
i
think
that
it
is
similar
to
the
case
that
this
court
had
before
it
and
the
companion
to
bar
howard
against
lyons
where
a
suit
was
brought
against
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
the
only
one
that
i
could
see
that
they
rely
on
that
conceivably
might
be
with
section
1331
which
is
the
federal
question
jurisdiction.
i
think
you
have
to
stretch
that
a
bit
to
say
that
that
is
the
kind
of
thing
involved
in
this
case.
but
that
would
seem
to
be
the
only
one
under
which
they
might
possibly
be
a
basis
here
or
it
were
the
bivens
type
of
suit
alleging
violations
of
the
first
and
fifth
amendment.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
is,
yes.
but
i
was
thinking
in
terms
of
the
claim
of
malicious
prosecution
and
defamation
so
is
growing
out
of
the
federal
thing.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
suppose
the
federal
question
would
be
whether
these
individuals
that
exceeded
their
authority
in
conducting
the
administrative
proceeding
which
may
be
enough
to
bring
it
in.
as
i
say,
we
have
not
focused
on
this
question,
this
issue
because
this
was
not
the
case
as
we
sought
that
came
up
to
this
court
from
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
we
would
be
happy,
if
the
court
wishes
to
submit
a
supplemental
memorandum
on
this
issue,
if
the
court
deems
it
desirable
because
we
have
not
frankly
focused
on
it
or
considered
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
only
motion
that
was
filed
for
want
of
jurisdiction
was
in
respect
to
the
suit
against
the
department
of
agriculture
in
the
commodity
credit
authority
and
that
was
on
the
ground
that
was
barred
by
sovereign
immunity.
there
was
no
claim,
no
suit,
just
motion
made
to
dismiss
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
in
the
sense
of
the
court
had
not
had
its
jurisdiction
properly
invoked.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
will
be
if
the
court
wishes
we
would
of
course
submit
a
memorandum
on
this
topic.
now,
the
issue
on
the
case
is
i
suppose
by
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
whether
these
government
officials
who
conducted
this
administrative
proceeding
have
absolute
immunity
as
we
contend
only
qualified
immunity
as
the
court
of
appeals
held.
and
the
critical
significance
of
that
distinction,
of
course,
is
that
under
absolute
immunity,
the
issues
are
relatively
narrow
whether
the
official
is
active
within
the
scope
of
his
authority
and
whether
the
action
was
discretionary.
whereas
on
the
qualified
immunity,
you
get
into
the
whole
problem
of
motive
and
intent
and
this
involves
a
far
more
sweeping
examination
and
the
kind
of
thing
that
normally
cannot
be
disposed
off
summarily
on
either
motion
to
dismiss
or
for
summary
judgment.
the
commodity
exchange
act
provides
a
comprehensive
regulatory
system
for
the
commissions
futures
business
and
under
the
act
people
who
are
so
called
the
commissions
futures
merchants
are
required
to
register
with
the
secretary
of
agriculture.
the
secretary
has
promulgated
a
regulation
that
requires
these
individuals
to
meet
certain
minimum
capital
balances
and
to
file
reports
on
their
balances.
the
respondent
mr.
economou,
and
his
corporation
were
registered
with
the
department
of
agriculture
as
futures
commission
merchants
and
he
submitted
one
of
these
reports
on
his
minimum
capital
situation
and
this
raised
some
questions
within
the
department
of
agriculture
over
the
correctness
of
his
report
and
whether
in
fact
he
was
in
compliance.
as
a
result
of
this,
an
audit
was
directed
of
his
books
and
records.
the
audit
was
made
and
eventually
the
assistant
secretary
of
agriculture
issued
an
administrative
complaint
subsequently
amended
and
broadened,
charging
that
mr.
economou
and
his
corporation
had
willfully
violated
the
minimum
capital
regulations.
in
accordance
with
the
standard
practice
in
the
department
of
agriculture,
this
complaint
was
made
available
in
the
department’s
press
room
with
a
cover
sheet
that
stated
exactly
summarized
what
the
complaint
alleged
and
pointed
out
that
the
mere
issuance
of
this
complaint
did
not
constitute
any
adjudication
of
violations.
a
hearing
was
held
before
a
hearing
examiner
of
the
department
who
found
that
mr.
economou
had
committed
these
willful
violations,
the
hearing
examiner
proposed
that
mr.
economou's
registration
be
suspended
for
90
days
and
for
that
period,
he
would
be
barred
from
any
trading
in
the
commodities
markets.
under
the
statute,
the
secretary
of
agriculture
has
delegated
to
the
judicial
officer
of
the
department,
the
authority
to
hear
appeals
in
such
cases.
this
matter
was
appealed
to
the
judicial
officer
who
upheld
the
decision
of
the
hearing
examiner
and
imposed
this
punishment.
the
court
of
appeals
set
aside
this
judicial
order
on
the
ground
that
the
finding
of
willfulness
was
erroneous.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
was
a
separate
proceeding.
this
proceeding,
this
lawsuit
began
during
the
time
the
case
was
pending
on
appeal
from
the
hearing
examiner
to
the
judicial
officer.
and
it
was
at
that
point
that
mr.
economou
began
this
case.
it
started
as
a
suit
to
enjoin
the
department
from
conducting
any
further
proceedings.
but
coupled
to
that
complaint
at
the
very
end
was
a
claim
for
$32
million
in
damages
and
then
at
a
later
stage
in
the
proceeding
the
complaint
was
amended
to
expand
on
the
claims
and
also
to
add
another
defendant
who
was
the
judicial
officer.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
was
filed
before
that
mr.
justice.
let
me
give
the
chronology.
the
hearing
examiner
had
decided
the
administrative
proceeding
adversely
to
mr.
economou.
he
had
appealed
from
that
decision
to
the
judicial
officer
and
then
he
brought
while
at
appeal
to
the
judicial
officer
was
pending,
before
the
judicial
officer
had
heard
argument
in
the
case,
the
present
complaint
was
filed
seeking
both
to
enjoin
further
administrative
proceedings
and
seeking
the
damages
of
$32
million.
after
the
injunction
was
denied
by
the
district
court,
then
the
case
proceeded
to
decision
before
the
judicial
officer,
then
the
decision
of
the
judicial
officer
was
taken
to
the
second
circuit
and
the
second
circuit
reversed
that
decision.
and
in
the
interim,
the
complaint
was
amended
as
i
say
to
expand
somewhat
on
the
causes
of
action
and
also
to
bring
in
as
a
defendant,
the
judicial
officer
who
had
decided
the
case
against
mr.
economou.
the
complaint
named
12
individual
defendants
starting
with
the
secretary
of
agriculture,
the
assistant
secretary
who
had
issued
the
complaint,
the
administrator
of
the
commodity
exchange
authority
who
directed
the
whole
proceeding
in
order
of
the
audit,
the
regional
director
in
new
york
under
whose
supervision
the
audit
was
conducted,
three
auditors
who
had
gone
in
audited
his
books,
a
man
named
davis
who
was
a
lawyer
in
the
general
councils
office
of
the
department
of
agriculture
who
had
tried
the
case
for
the
government,
the
hearing
examiner
who
had
initially
decided
it
and
the
judicial
officer
who
had
affirmed
the
hearing
officers’
decision.
the
amended
complaint
said
that
by
maliciously
and
wrongfully
instituting
these
proceedings
against
mr.
economou,
the
people
under
the
department
of
agriculture
had
tried
to
injure
his
reputation
and
put
him
out
of
business.
and
the
complaint
suggests
that
they
did
these
things
because
he
had
been
very
critical
of
the
way
these
people
were
administering
the
act.
more
specifically,
he
makes
three
claims.
he
says
first,
the
institution
of
the
proceedings
was
unauthorized
because
the
department
had
not
given
him
a
warning
letter,
which
they
normally
would
do
and
thus
afforded
him
the
opportunity
to
bring
these
mistakes
into
line
to
correct
any
deficiencies.
secondly,
they
said
he
had
no
authority
to
issue
a
sanction
of
any
sort
because
prior
to
the
time
the
sanction
was
issued,
he
had
seized
operating
as
a
futures
commission
merchant.
and
third,
the
defendants
were
charged
with
issuing
a
defamatory
press
release,
which
i
assume
has
reference
to
the
release
of
the
complaint
in
the
covering
memorandum
to
the
press
office.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
complaint
you
mean?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
the
press
release
itself
is
not
set
forth
in
the
appendix
but
the
cover
sheet
to
the
press
release
is
set
forth
at
page
150.
all
that
there
was,
was
that
there
was
a
cover
sheet
and
the
copy
of
the
administrative
complaint.
the
complaint
was
released
to
the
press
together
with
this
cover
sheet,
which
is
set
forth
at
page
150.
now,
at
the
earliest
stage
of
this
case
when
mr.
economou
--
let
me
add
one
other
thing,
the
complaint
set
forth
ten
different
causes
of
action.
four
of
which
were
asserted
to
violate
the
respondent’s
constitutional
rights,
rights
under
the
due
process
clause
and
his
rights
to
free
speech.
and
as
i
have
indicated,
he
sought
damages
of
$32
million,
which
have
broken
down
into
various
segments,
six
million
for
this,
four
million
for
that,
800,000
for
something
else.
now,
at
the
earlier
stage
of
the
proceedings
in
opposing
his
application
for
a
stay
of
the
administrative
proceedings,
the
defendants
had
filed
an
affidavit
by
the
petition
of
mr.
davis,
the
lawyer
of
the
agriculture
department
that
set
forth
in
detail
the
functions
performed
by
each
of
the
individual
defendants
with
respect
to
this
case.
on
the
basis
of
that
affidavit,
the
defendants
then
moved
to
dismiss
this
suit
on
the
ground
that
was
barred
by
the
doctrine
of
official
immunity.
the
district
court
so
held
and
did
dismiss
it.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
holding
that
while
this
courts
decision
in
bar
if
it
had
been
the
last
word
on
this
subject
might
well
induce
them
as
it
had
the
district
court
to
hold
that
these
people
were
protected
by
official
immunity.
it
believed
that
the
more
recent
decisions
of
this
court
involving
the
immunity
of
state
officials
sued
under
section
1983
of
title
42
suggested
that
there
has
been
a
change
in
the
law.
and
they
thought
that
under
these
new
cases,
a
qualified
immunity,
the
good
faith
and
reasonable
ground
tests
suggested
in
scheuer
against
woods
would
be
adequate
to
protect
these
individuals.
now
as
we
see
the
case,
there
are
two
basic
issues
in
the
case,
the
first
is
whether
the
absolute
immunity
that
this
court
recognized
in
barr
against
matteo
is
still
a
sound
doctrine
and
if
so
whether
the
more
recent
cases
under
section
1983,
now
indicate
that
only
qualified
immunity
is
appropriate.
the
reason
for
absolute
immunity
have
been
stated
many
times,
and
i
cannot
find
any
better
statement
than
what
learned
hand
said
many
years
ago
in
gregoire
against
biddle
which
we
have
set
forth
to
pages
17-18
of
our
brief
and
which
this
court
quoted
from
extensively
in
bar
and
because
of
the
time
i
will
not
quote
it
but
what
learned
hand
said
in
effect
was,
it
goes
without
saying
he
began
that
if
in
fact
a
government
official
has
misused
his
authority
and
has
injured
someone,
it
would
be
monstrous
to
deny
that
person
recovery.
but
he
said
the
problem
is
you
cannot
tell
that
until
the
case
has
been
tried
and
therefore
if
you
permit
people
to
make
these
charges
and
force
the
respondent
to
defend
on
the
merits,
this
is
likely
to
inhibit
all
but
the
most
fearless
and
all
but
the
most
vigorous
from
acting
as
they
should
act.
because
as
he
said
“again
and
again
the
public
interest
calls
for
action
which
may
turn
out
to
be
founded
on
a
mistake
in
the
face
of
which
an
official
may
laid
upon
himself
hard
put
to
it
to
satisfy
a
jury
of
his
good
faith.
and
he
said,
it
is
so
often
the
case
the
answer
must
be
found
in
a
balance
between
the
evils
inevitable
and
either
alternative.
in
the
instance
that
has
been
thought
in
the
end,
better
to
leave
and
un-redress
the
wrongs
done
by
dishonest
officers
than
to
subject
those
who
try
to
do
their
duty
to
the
constant
dread
of
retaliation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
has
to
be
what
they
say,
that
was
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
outer
perimeter
of
this
authority?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
suppose
so.
it
is
a
kind
of
thing
that
had
to
be
someway
connected.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
that
is
what
the
immunity
was
intended
to
protect,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
was
within
the
general
scope
of
his
authority.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
right.
in
this
case
for
example,
it
was
ultimately
held
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
finding
of
willfulness
was
erroneous.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
then
i
would
think
he
was
clearly
acting
beyond
his
authority.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
not,
i
would
think
that
because
if
he
is
acting
beyond
his
authority,
he
does
not
have
any
immunity
at
all
or
if
he
is
acting
patently
beyond
his
authority.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
it
is
not
the
allegation
that
he
said
knowingly,
i
think
the
question
is
whether
in
fact
what
he
was
doing
was
within
his
assigned
duty--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
do
not
think
that
is
enough
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
that
is
a
different
case
where
it
has
been
held,
where
it
has
been
held
that
he
does
not
have
that
authority
but
where
the
allegation
is
only
that
there
was
no
authority
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
that
is
the
allegation
that
is
always
made
in
these
cases
mr.
justice.
it
is
always
alleged
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes
and
it
was
a
close
question
whether
this
particular
official
had
the
authority
to
issue
press
releases.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
say
except
for
the
one
case
that
justice
white
poses
where
it
had
been
previously
held
that
he
does
not
have
the
authority.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
assume
from
justice
white’s
question
that
was
held
by
the
courts.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
presumably
by
a
court
whose
ruling
the
official
would
feel
obliged
to
observe.
i
mean,
we
do
know
that
there
are
instances
in
which
officials
of
the
government
seek
to
obtain
the
conflict
among
the
circuits
and
they
do
not
consider
themselves
bound
by
a
particular
court.
now,
if
i
may
turn
to
the
facts
of
this
case
to
see
what
this
charge
involves
and
i
would
like
to
show
why
the
importance
of
absolute
immunity
is
in
this
situation.
the
affidavits
show
that
everything
that
the
defendants
did
in
this
case
was
all
their
actions
were
taken
as
part
of
their
duties
in
enforcing
this
statute.
under
the
statute,
the
secretary
is
directed
to
investigate
when
an
investigation
is
appropriate
to
see
whether
in
fact
there
were
violations
of
the
minimum
capital
requirements.
once
it
appeared
that
there
was
a
violation
they
would
justify
in
issuing
the
complaint
and
once
the
complaint
was
issued
mr.
davis
had
assigned
to
him
the
trial
of
this
case
as
part
of
his
duties.
the
hearing
examiner's
sole
connection
with
this
case
was
deciding
the
case
on
the
record
before
him
as
that
was
the
function
performed
by
the
judicial
officer.
now,
going
to
mr.
economou
in
a
lengthy
affidavit
that
he
filed
in
this
case,
all
of
this
was
his
plot
against
him.
i
would
like
to
refer
the
court
to
page
29
of
the
appendix,
where
mr.
economou
says
in
this
affidavit,
the
action
undertaken
by
the
(cea)
commodity
exchange
authority
in
their
docket
no.167
and
various
acts
of
officials
and
employees
in
connection
therewith
are
in
actuality,
an
organized
conspiracy
for
the
specific
purpose
of
discrediting
me
in
the
financial
community
and
with
investing
public
and
through
me
course
of
downfall
and
destruction
of
the
american
board
of
trading,
a
new
exchange
in
market
place.
that
was
an
entity
that
mr.
economou
was
trying
to
organize.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
think
that
the
auditors
in
this
case
were
really
performing
factors
which
involved
considerable
discretion
because
in
conducting
an
audit,
you
have
to
decide
what
you
are
going
to
look
at,
how
intensively
you
are
going
to
go
into
it,
how
much
you
are
going
to
question
these
people
and
once
again,
it
seems
to
us
the
threat
of
possible
suit
with
these
enormous
damages
being
sought
here.
this
is
enough
to
deter
the
auditor
for
perhaps
being
as
vigilant
as
he
might
be.
obviously,
the
farther
down
the
line
you
go,
the
lesser
the
discretion
involved
and
at
some
point
it
seizes
to
be
discretionary
rule
of
course
but
we
think
there
is
enough
here
in
terms
of
the
auditors
that
they
did
have
enough
discretion
to
make
this
inappropriate.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
it
might
vary
form
case
to
case
but
i
think
there
would
be
more
like
the
auditors
in
this
case.
i
would
think
so.
let
me
just
come
to
another
aspect
of
this.
all
of
these
people
are
basically
conducting
an
investigatory
proceeding.
a
disciplinary
proceeding
to
determine
whether
some
sanction
be
imposed
upon
the
respondent.
i
suggest
that
for
instance
that
if
there
is
the
danger
that
at
some
later
point,
these
officials
are
going
to
have
to
try
to
justify
to
a
jury
what
they
did
in
the
face
of
these
charges
of
a
conspiracy
and
of
course,
it
is
colored
by
the
claim
that
they
were
after
him
because
he
had
been
critical
of
the
way
they
were
administering
the
act.
if
they
have
to
justify
this,
it
seems
not
unreasonable
to
conclude
that
in
a
close
case
they
may
share
their
decision.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
is
one
of
the
factors,
the
point
that
you
do
not
have
to
subject
government
officials
to
personal
liability
in
order
to
correct,
if
any
errors
that
may
have
been
created
here.
if
everything
he
says
about
this
proceeding
is
true
it
has
been
corrected
because
of
the
reversal
of
the
decision
against
them.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
his
in
juries
of
course
have
not
been
recompensed.
but
again,
we
come
back,
it
seems
to
me
to
the
basic
policy
underlying
the
immunity
which
this
court
has
recognized
in
barr
and
that
which
learned
hand
recognized
that
it
has
been
considered
better
that
there
maybe
are
occasional
instances
in
which
somebody
who
has
just
claim
will
be
denied
it
that
that
is
outweighed
by
the
importance
in
the
public
interest
of
making
sure
that
government
officials
are
not
deterred
from
acting
vigorously
and
fearlessly
because
of
the
threat
of
possible
private
liability.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct
with
one
or
two
possible
exceptions.
there
may
be
situations
where
we
see
something
of
a
conflict
of
interest
among
all
the
defendants
in
which
case
will
avoid
this
conflict
by
putting
up,
furnishing
the
funds
for
them
to
retain
outside
council
or
secondly
where
a
charge
and
a
suit
like
this
suggest
the
possibility
of
some
criminal
violation.
and
of
course,
if
the
department
might
ultimately
be
prosecuting
some
of
these
people
we
do
not
attempt
to
defend
them
in
a
civil
liability.
in
that
situation,
once
again
we
do
provide
them
with
outside
council.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
pay
for
the
outside
council.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
ordinarily,
the
official
would
have
to
pay
it
out
of
his
own
pocket.
unless
there
are
some
statutes
specifically
authorizing
the
payment
of
such
a
judgment,
the
government
has
no
funds
ordinarily
to
pay
those
judgments.
now
conceivably,
in
some
situations,
congress
might
enact
a
private
bill
to
pay
for
it;
but
normally
it
is
the
official
who
pays
it
out
of
his
own
pocket.
and
that
is
the
thing
that
really
has
this
almost
in
to
(inaudible)
effect
upon
the
official.
it
is
coming
out
of
their
own
pocket.
a
man
may
have
his
lifetime
savings
wiped
out
if
a
jury
several
years
later
should
conclude
that
what
it
seemed
to
him
at
that
time
to
be
a
reasonable
action
in
fact
was
not
taken
in
good
faith.
that
is
the
thing
that
seems
to
me
as
the
most
serious
and
bothersome
and
dangerous
about
this
thing.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
normally,
there
would
not.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
might
add
that
the
attorney
general
who
has
just
recently
proposed
legislation
under
which
these
suits
would
be
channeled
away
from
the
individual
defendant
to
the
united
states.
to
amend
the
tort
claims
act
to
permit
this
type
of
suit
to
be
brought
under
the
tort
claims
act.
that
legislation
has
just
recently
been
recommended
because
of
concern
that
something
should
be
done
to
rectify
the
situation
where
individuals
have
suffered
damages
as
a
result
of
the
government
action.
but
it
seems
to
us
that
that
is
very
different
thing
from
subjecting
the
individuals
personally
to
liability
for
what
they
have
done
in
the
course
of
their
profession.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
so
and
we
are
hopeful
that
this
legislation
will
be
enacted
but
when
and
how,
it
is
difficult
to
predict.
i
may
like
to
just
come
to
one
other
thing
which
is
the
question
of
these
cases
that
the
court
has
decided
scheuer
against
rhodes,
wood
against
strickland
under
section
1983.
we
think
that
those
cases
do
not
announce
any
modification
of
the
salutary
principle
recognized
in
barr
against
matteo.
we
think
those
cases
turn
on
the
fact
that
in
section
1983,
congress
provided
a
remedy
against
state
officials
for
persons
whose
constitutional
rights
have
been
denied
them
by
those
officials
under
the
color
of
law
and
this
court
has
recognized
several
times.
it
would
really
vitiate
that
section,
would
rob
it
of
its
effectiveness,
if
because
of
the
existence
of
absolute
immunity
those
officials
could
not
be
held
responsible
for
the
conduct
they
had
committed.
indeed
this
court
has
recognized
that
one
of
the
things
that
congress
intended
to
do
under
1983
was
to
provide
a
remedy
for
people
against
state
officials
who
had
under
their
state
authority,
done
these
things.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
am
not
sure.
the
only
relation
i
could
suggest
is
perhaps
a
suggestion
that
is
better
that
occasionally,
a
particular
individual
not
recover
than
at
the
large
group
of
government
officials
be
deterred.
it
is
kind
of
a
converse,
i
mean,
in
one
case
it
is
better
that
hundred
guilty
go
free
than
one
innocent
go
to
jail.
here,
it
is
that
it
is
better
than
an
occasional
one
not
be
able
to
recover
than
that
the
hundred
government
officials
be
deterred
from
acting
vigorously.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
that
it
seems
to
me
that
the
investigator
brings
up
a
different
problem.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
court
has
recognized
in
pierson
against
ray
that
police
officers
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
1983.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
but
also
at
common
law
traditionally,
police
officers
have
had
in
effect
a
qualified
immunity
that
has
been
tradition
--.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
at
some
lower
level,
if
the
discretion
that
a
police
officer
exercises
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
arrest
someone
or
whether
to
break
down
the
door
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
involves
discretion
but
probably
not
the
kind
of
policy
discretion
that
the
immunity
principle
is
designed
further.
it
has
been
said
in
some
courts
that
a
fair
test
of
whether
or
not
this
is
a
kind
of
discretion.
is
this
the
kind
of
action
by
the
government
official
that
the
possibility
of
substantial
person
liability
is
likely
to
deter
him
from
taking
that
is
the
kind
of
thing?
and
police
for
centuries
have
been
acting
vigorously
and
they
all
know
that
if
they
exceed
their
authority
they
are
sealed
for
false
arrest.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
what?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
may,
but
this
i
think
is
a
special
case.
the
courts
have
not
definitively
decided
yet
the
precise
scope
of
the
immunity
of
all
federal
officials
and
as
we
suggest
in
our
brief,
this
court
does
not
have
to
determine
the
outer
perimeters
of
that
immunity
in
this
case
because
we
think
whatever
may
be
those
limits
certainly
all
of
these
individuals
as
what
they
did
in
this
case
are
well
within
the,--
if
i
may
say
so,
the
inner
perimeter
of
their
duties.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
have
suggested
that
mr.
justice.
certainly
with
respect
with
respect
to
mr.
davis,
the
lawyer
who
tried
the
case
at
the
administrative
level,
his
function
is
basically
that
of
a
prosecutor
and
the
auditors
by
the
way
in
addition
to
conducting
the
audit
also
testified
as
witnesses
and
witnesses
traditionally
have
immunity
and
also
participated
and
aided
the
prosecutor
in
presenting
the
case.
the
assistant
secretary,
who
issued
the
complaint
might
viewed
as
perhaps
analogous
to
the
prosecutor
who
gets
the
indictment
before
the
grand
jury.
as
we
set
out
in
our
briefs
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
were
investigating
and
that
we
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
is
hard
to
say,
they
are
somewhere
in
between
i
think.
they
are
somewhere
in
between,
the
audit
is
somewhat
different
from
what
the
fbi
agent
does
but
it
also
has
some
similarities.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
court
of
appeals
suggested
some
distinctions
which
we
do
not
think
stand
up,
we
think
the
basic
purpose
of
the
immunity
is
the
same
whether
they
are
prosecuting
a
criminal
case
or
bringing
this
kind
of
an
enforcer.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
but
we
think
that
some
of
them
are
covered
by
that
and
some
of
them
are
some
of
them
are
covered
by
various
other
facts.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
generally,
and
for
example
we
think
the
judicial
officer
and
hearing
examiner
have
an
immunity
comparable
with
that
of
the
judges
traditionally.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
the
auditor
would
be
liable
in
that
situation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
because
that
is
not
a
part
of
his
job
to
hold
a
press
release
and
call
the
names.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
do
not
mr.
justice
and
let
me
explain
why.
it
is
very
easy
when
a
complaint
is
being
drawn
to
charge
that
the
actions
of
the
government
officials
denied
you
your
property
without
due
process
of
law.
i
suppose
in
any
case
where
an
administrative
proceeding
were
brought
to
revoke
someone’s
registration
or
suspend
their
license
or
something
like
that
it
is
very
easy
to
allege
that
this
resulted
in
the
denial
of
due
process
of
law.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
do
it
more
and
more.
this
is
happening
more
and
more
here
of
the
ten
courses
of
action,
four
of
them
assert
a
violation
of
constitutional
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
is
a
factual
distinction
but
not
one
that
we
think
warrants
a
different
immunity
in
the
case
of
the
constitution.
in
this
case
for
example,
the
different
courses
of
action
shift
back
and
forth
and
it
seems
to
us,
we
are
most
strange
to
say
well,
with
respect
to
six
of
his
courses
of
action
the
government
officials
have
absolute
immunity
but
with
respect
to
the
other
four
which
are
very
similar
but
where
he
is
alleged
a
violation
of
constitutional
rights
they
have
only
qualified
immunity.
we
think
the
fact
that
a
charge
is
made
that
the
action
of
the
government
officials
violated
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
plaintiff
should
not
cause
any
different
result.
we
have
discussed
that
at
some
length
in
our
brief.
