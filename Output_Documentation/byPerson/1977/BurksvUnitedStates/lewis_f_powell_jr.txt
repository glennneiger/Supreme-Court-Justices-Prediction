justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
easterbrook,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
in
this
case
ended
up
by
adapting
the
standards
and
procedure
prescribed
by
the
fifth
circuit
in
bass
and
this
concise
statement
of
those
standards
in
its
opinion.
are
those
standards
acceptable
too
and
compatible
with
a
position
you
are
arguing
here
today?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
seemed
to
me
that
what
you
said
on
pages
37
and
38
of
your
brief
somewhat
more
complex.
two
basic
inquiries
will
be
made
of
a
district
court
on
remand
under
the
bass
standard.
first
of
all
was
that
additional
evidence
that
would
be
relevant
to
a
verdict
and
secondly
whether
or
not
there
had
been
some
prosecutorial
default
in
not
having
presented
that
evidence
at
the
appropriate
time.
now,
those
two
standards
would
not
be
too
difficult,
in
my
view,
for
lower
courts
to
apply.
i
am
thinking
of
a
question
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
asked
you.
