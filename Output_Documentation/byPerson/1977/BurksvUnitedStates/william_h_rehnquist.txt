rehnquist
what
about
the
choice
between
a
new
trial
and
a
judgment
of
conviction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
you
move
for
a
--
in
the
trial
court
you
move
for
a
judgment
of
acquittal
on
insufficiency
of
the
evidence,
move
for
a
trial
on
the
ground
that
is
against
the
way
that
the
evidence
or
whatever
the
rule
may
provide.
your
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal
is
denied,
your
motion
for
new
trial
it
is
granted.
do
you
think
that
at
the
commencement
of
that
second
trial
you
can
then
raise
a
double
jeopardy
claim?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
it
is
just
a
minute
order
the
trial
judge,
motion
for
judgment
nov
denied,
motion
for
new
trial
granted
on
the
grounds
of
against
the
weight
to
the
evidence.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
he
is
being
carried
it
second
time
for
the
same
offense,
how
can
that
be
done
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
what
basis
do
you
agree?
was
there
a
statutory
matter
or
a
common
law
matter
of
constitution?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
is
on
direct
appeal?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
is
still
on
direct
appeal?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
say
your
opponent's
argument
is
suffered,
is
tried
and
performed
over
substance,
i
am
inclined
to
think
yours
is
a
try
of
substance
over
a
form,
if
you
are
going
to
have
every
one
if
these
an
ad
hoc
determination
by
the
trial
judge
as
to
whether
18
factors
have
been
met
for
not.
this
is
a
rule,
it
has
got
to
be
applied
by
400
federal
trial
judges
and
thousands
of
state
court
judges;
it
is
got
to
have
some
black
and
white
line
drawing
character
to
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
brief
certainly
reveals
your
feeling
to
that
effect.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
about
is
this
ultimate
determination
made,
when
the
man
has
brought
for
trial
the
second
time
in
the
district
court
or
in
the
superior
court
whatever
the
(inaudible)
court
is.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
about
the
50-state
jurisdictions
that
are
going
to
be
affected
by
your
argument?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
are
turning
some
thousands
of
(inaudible)
judges
lose
to
make
this
ad
hoc
determination,
balancing
of
factors
that
can
come
up
one
way
in
one
case
and
another
way
presumably
in
a
very,
very
similar
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
compound
one
sin
with
another?
