tateo
was
during
the
trial,
was
not
he?
justice

marshall
well,
i
am
saying
there
cannot
be
guilt
on
the
part
of
by
the
person
who
is
insane,
downed
by
one
of
the
arguments
about
the
definition
of
insanity,
but
putting
that
to
one
side,
a
person
who
is
insane
cannot
be
guilty
of
a
criminal
offense.
you
would
agree
with
that,
wouldn’t
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
did
not
say
anything;
this
case
said,
insufficiency
of
the
evidence,
and
that
is
not
like
forgetting
the
show
that
the
man
was
80-years-old.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
they
did
not,
but
that
was
the
basis
of
rule,
wasn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
wasn’t
that
the
basis
of
the
ruling,
of
their
ruling?
