justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
easterbrook
coming
to
the
glasser
rule,
should
not
the
evidence
have
been
taken
most
favorably
to
support
the
verdict,
and
therefore
would
not
the
appellate
court
have
a
duty
to
assume
that
the
jury
did
make
the
inference
if
that
was
a
permissible
inference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
did
not
cross
petitions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
don’t
we
have
to
take
the
case
as
though
the
court
of
appeals
held
the
evidence
was
insufficient.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
do
not
understand
--
may
i
just
say,
well,
i
do
not
really
understand
your
example
because
if
we
assume
in
accordance
with
glasser
that
the
jury
did
draw
all
the
inferences
favorable
to
the
government
that
it
could
have
drawn
and
the
court
of
appeals
nevertheless
found
the
evidence
insufficient,
why
is
this
different
from
the
last
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
have
the
duty
to
affirm.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
how
can
you
say
then
it
is
erring
on
the
side
of
affirmance,
just
to
perform
its
duty?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn’t
it
beneficial
for
us?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
why
is
it
so
clear
that
that
is
an
attractive
option?
if
you
remand
in
doubtful
cases,
you
put
society
the
expense
of
a
second
trial
which
really
maybe
unnecessary
and
you
may
put
both
parties
at
the
burden
of
another
trial
and
you
may
also
let
a
guilty
man
go
free.
there
are
two
sides
to
all
these
arguments,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
easterbrook,
let
me
just
test
your
example
about
the
multiple
conspiracies
versus
the
single
conspiracy,
the
(inaudible)
kind
of
problem,
i
guess
that
is
what
you
have
in
mind.
you
are
saying
the
trial
judge
could
either
hold,
he
could
either
conclude
there
was
not
enough
evidence
to
prove
the
particular
conspiracy
charge
or
alternatively
he
could
hold
that
there
was
prejudicial
evidence
of
a
lot
of
other
conspiracies.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
he
holds
the
former,
why
does
not
that
entitle
the
defendant
to
acquittal
and
if
he
holds
the
later,
it
is
clearly
he
is
entitled
to
new
trial,
why
is
it
such
a
complicated
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
if
he
is
charged
with
one
and
the
one
charge
has
not
been
proved,
why
should
not
the
man
go
free
simply
because
an
additional
error
was
committed.
isn’t
that
what
you
are
saying?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
also
your
hypothesis
is
that
on
appeal
the
appellate
court
was
able
to
identify
the
error
that
it
was
decided
required
reversal,
and
if
it
identified
it
as
a
failure
of
proof,
one
could
say
without
terrible
difficulty
that
requires
acquittal,
if
one
--
if
he
determines
that
it
was
prejudice
because
other
conspiracies
have
proved,
it
would
follow
a
new
trial.
but
isn’t
that
just
a
matter
of
deciding
the
issues?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
you
have
the
ball
case
that
fits
right
into
a
neat
category
too,
does
not
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
there
are
a
lot
of
the
appellate
decisions
that
are
very,
very
difficult,
but
that
does
not
mean
we
dispense
with
rules,
does
it?
