mr.
bart
c.
durham,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
rose
in
nashville,
tennessee,
it
is
a
bank
robbery,
which
occurred
there
some
two
years
ago.
the
defendant
at
his
arraignment
imposed
to
plea
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity.
at
that
time
in
the
sixth
circuit,
we
were
operating
under
the
smith
rule
which
we
presently
are
today
and
known
as
smith
i,
a
case
that
cited
in
1968.
the
defendant
as
i
say
entered
the
plea
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
and
on
motion
of
the
government
he
was
ordered
to
be
examined
for
mental
competency.
the
order
of
the
district
court
which
required
him
to
be
examined,
set
out
the
three
rules
which
the
sixth
circuit
chooses
alru
basically
requires
and
ordered
the
physician
to
report
to
the
court
and
the
united
states
attorney
the
answers
to
those
questions.
trial
came
on
sometime
later
and
the
issue
was
contested
on
the
facts
at
the
trial,
but
of
the
trial
transcript
on
those
bulk
of
it
--
not
probably
the
bulk
--
is
consumed
with
really
the
only
defense
and
that
is
insanity.
the
united
states
used
a
psychiatrist
and
a
psychologist
as
their
witnesses.
they
also
used
laypersons
in
the
bank
and
a
cabdriver
who
was
kidnapped
just
before
the
robbery
for
few
moments
and
as
i
said
they
used
the
laywitnesses
in
the
bank
and
they
used
the
fbi
agents
who
apprehended
him
just
a
few
moments
and
took
after
the
bank
robbery
and
made
the
arrest.
the
defendant
used
his
experts,
the
family
of
the
defendant,
who
testified
the
bizarre,
erratic
and
unusual
behavior
and
three
medical
witnesses,
two
highly
qualified
psychiatrists,
one
of
whom
had
been
used,
dr.
mandan
(ph),
who
had
been
used
many
times
by
the
united
states
as
their
choice
to
examine
potential
defendants
in
imposing
insanity
offenses.
mr.
bart
c.
durham,
iii
no
sir,
my
point
is
just
saying
there
were
five
medical
experts
witnesses
and
it
was
extensively
presented
to
the
trial
court.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
looked
into
that
matter
and
they
reversed
the
case
under
the
authority
of
28
u.s.c.
2106
federal
statute,
which
empowers
this
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
to
enter
such
orders
as
are
just
are
appropriate.
the
sixth
circuit,
in
my
thinking,
made
a
finding
of
fact
that
the
government
did
not
make
a
prima
facie
case.
counsel
for
the
united
states
has
raised
the
question
of
whether
--
raised
by
the
members
of
the
court
few
minutes
earlier
as
to
whether
the
government
made
a
prima
facie
case
or
to
what
extent
one
might
read
that
opinion
in
the
sixth
circuit.
but
in
any
event
they
found
that
because
of
insufficient
evidence
the
case
should
be
remanded.
the
sixth
circuit
cited
the
bryan
rule
which
has
been
discussed
today.
as
your
honors
know
and
as
i
have
set
out,
there
was
no
criminal
appeal
except
in
extraordinary
cases
until
1890
something
and
then
i
believe
only
in
capital
cases.
in
1896
the
ball
rule
came
forth,
which
was
an
attack
on
double
jeopardy
and
it
is
a
lien
case
in
that,
and
that
set
forth
the
rule
of
waiver,
in
which
it
was
said
that
sometimes
someone
who
got
a
new
trial
was
either
starting
on
a
clean
slide
or
that
there
was
continuing
jeopardy
or
that
by
asking
for
a
new
trial
he
had
waived.
and
much
of
the
my
brief
is
taken
up
with
regarding
the
waiver
rationale
in
light
of
this
court’s
later
opinions
and
particularity
in
light
of
the
green
decision
of
this
court.
i
believe
the
solicitor
general’s
brief,
a
fair
reading
of
that,
is
that
he
pretty
much
agrees
with
me
that
waiver
is
not
an
issue.
with
respect
to
waiver
where
one
specifically
asks
for
a
new
trial
as
well
as
a
judgment
of
acquittal,
which
was
a
question
asked
sometime
ago.
i
would
only
say
that
any
defendant
would
rather
have
an
acquittal
rather
than
a
new
trial.
if
that
is
the
only
choice
with
which
he
has
faced
then
it
is
no
choice
at
all.
whereas
in
this
case,
we
asked
the
district
judge
both
for
a
new
trial
--
we
filed
motion
for
a
new
trial
alleging
other
errors.
mr.
bart
c.
durham,
iii
a
new
trial
and
a
judgment
of
conviction
-
that
is
the
one
which
defendant
might
on
appropriate
occasions
prefer
a
judgment
of
conviction
in
light
of
jackson
v.
stemclone
(ph)
and
some
of
the
cases
this
court
has
decided
that
he
might
get
more
time
on
the
second.
mr.
bart
c.
durham,
iii
no
sir.
mr.
bart
c.
durham,
iii
assuming
it
was
denied
--
assuming
that
was
spelled
out
if
you
were
denying
it
--
mr.
bart
c.
durham,
iii
no
sir,
i
do
not
think
he
could.
i
think
the
only
--
it
would
be
limited
to
that
to
where
it
was
clear
that
where
it
went
to
the
question
of
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence,
it
was
just
an
amended
order,
i
do
not
think
you
would
have
enough
of
a
record
with
it.
mr.
bart
c.
durham,
iii
well,
it
is
one
of
the
exceptions
that,
and
i
do
not
think
one
brings,
one
must
bring
oneself
within
the
exceptions
and
i
do
not
think
that
one
properly
has
in
that
instance.
bryan
versus
united
states
was
what
i
believed
to
be
the
first
considered
opinion
that
was
decided
in
1950
by
this
court.
as
i
pointed
out,
it
was
a
12
paragraph
decision,
it
was
decided
a
few
months
or
within
a
short
time
after
the
new
rules
of
federal
criminal
procedure
were
adapted,
and
it
was
primarily
concerned
in
my
judgment
with
the
application
of
the
rules
involved
the
district
court
reasonably
the
power
of
the
court
of
appeals,
and
the
court
did
have
language
in
there
and
did
say
in
the
final
paragraph
that
it
does
not
violate
the
double
jeopardy
provision
of
the
united
states
constitution
to
retry
on
me
in
the
second
time
for
insufficient
evidence.
subsequent
to
1950
in
the
bryan
case
it
has
been
the
subject
of
nothing
but
uncomplimentary
articles
both
in
the
courts,
discussions
in
the
courts
and
in
the
law
review
articles
to
the
fact
that
bryan
was
wrongly
decided.
if
i
read
the
brief
of
the
united
states
fairly,
i
believe
that
they
are
willing
to
give
a
great
deal
on
bryan
although
they
are
not
of
course
willing
to
give
all.
in
fact,
if
i
read
the
brief
fairly
for
the
united
states,
you
can
almost
make
their
argument
that
they
are
willing
to
give
this
case,
but
they
wish
to
urge
to
the
court
that
it
would
not
be
the
bryan
overruling
such
be
the
case
and
not
to
be
extended
to
all
cases
where
the
evidence
is
insufficient
to
support
the
verdict.
the
reasons
advanced
for
double
jeopardy
occurring
where
the
evidence
is
insufficient
to
support
the
verdict
have
been
numerous.
since
1950,
i
think
we
have
seen
an
increase
in
decisions
on
double
jeopardy,
double
jeopardy
is
a
hierarchy
of
rights,
it
has
taken
a
strong
position.
some
of
the
reasons
for
which
i
would
urge
on
the
court
why
this
distinction
should
be
allowed
would
be
as
follows.
before
i
get
to
that
let
me
point
out
that
difference
between
reversal
for
procedural
errors
and
reversals
for
insufficient
evidence.
where
the
case
is
reversed
for
procedural
error,
the
defendant
did
not
get
the
trial
of
which
he
was
entitled.
the
prosecutor
made
some
remark
that
was
wrong,
a
statement
that
was
introduced
against
him
which
was
not
reliably
probative
or
some
other
reason.
so
we
have
a
great
--
here
to
for
as
it
seems
to
me
unrecognized
quantum
difference
between
a
reversal
for
procedural
error,
such
as
even
in
bryan,
where
the
two
cases
it
cited
involved
those
type
of
cases.
mr.
bart
c.
durham,
iii
yes
sir,
i
mean
any
other
error
other
than
just
failure
of
the
state
to
sufficiently
--
mr.
bart
c.
durham,
iii
excuse
me
sir,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
bart
c.
durham,
iii
no
sir.
mr.
bart
c.
durham,
iii
yes
sir,
pretrial
errors,
defective
indictment,
statute
of
limitations,
and
some
of
those
errors.
mr.
bart
c.
durham,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
bart
c.
durham,
iii
yes
sir,
in
one
category
i
think
we
put
all
errors
involving
insufficiency
of
the
evidence,
and
in
box
b
we
put
everything
else,
and
i
think
it
is
readily
as
tenable,
the
quantum
as
i
have
said
difference
between
the
two.
now,
as
i
said
this
court
has
never
given
as
far
as
i
know
plenary
consideration
or
even
discussed
that
difference
until
today.
now,
some
of
the
arguments
in
favor
of
granting
acquittals
after
insufficient
evidence
that
have
to
do
with
the
disparity
of
treatment
which
the
same
defendant
might
receive.
for
example,
other
trial
courts
--
let
us
assume
that
the
evidence
is
insufficient
to
support
the
verdict.
trial
court
a
might
affirm
as
we
have
heard
here
in
the
case
of
florida,
and
other
judge
might
grant
a
new
trial
on
the
same
proof.
also
other
appellate
courts,
two
different
panels
of
appellate
courts
might
grant
acquittals.
and
the
sixth
circuit
in
a
case
i
have
cited
in
my
brief,
rosenberger,
the
court
of
appeals,
one
panel
sent
the
case
back
a
few
years
ago
for
--
ordered
a
judgment
of
acquittal,
and
the
present
case
before
you
today,
they
sent
it
back
for
a
new
trial
and
then
you
have
different
standards.
the
case
was
sent
back
today
under
a
fifth
circuit
standard.
in
other
instances,
the
standard
has
been
rather
most
is
just
an
appropriate
sometimes
if
like
in
the
willey
(ph)
case
or
some
of
the
other
cases
i
mentioned,
they
have
been
sent
back
as
to
whether
or
not
the
prosecution
was
unfairly
prevented
from
bringing
evidence.
so
one
has
--
people
being,
cases
either
being
sent
back
or
not
sent
back
and
those
that
are
sent
back
then
we
have
different
standards
for
that.
so
we
almost
have
a
lawless,
as
mr.
justice
stevens
pointed
out,
questions
suggested
to
me
as
we
have
a
lawless
system
of
appellate
review
we
are
standardless.
furthermore,
there
is
an
argument
that
the
idea
of
allowing
the
government
two
bytes
of
the
apple
in
instances
of
insufficient
evidence
condones
and
perpetuates
careless
prosecutorial
trial
and
preparation,
and
i
believe
a
fair
reading
of
the
record
would
show
that
that
is
true
in
this
instance.
in
this
instance,
it
seems
egregious.
number
one,
there
was
a
plea
of
not
guilty
“by
reason
of
insanity”
and
orally
in
court.
so
that
would
vested
arraignment
what
it
would
be.
number
two,
the
judge’s
order
to
determine
competency
set
out
the
three
rules
of
smith.
number
three,
the
defensive
trial
of
course
had
raised
an
issue
of
insanity
first
and
they
asked
every
witness,
they
went
right
down
the
smith
rule
in
the
sixth
circuit.
furthermore,
the
record
shows
that
we
had
large
charts
in
which
we
asked
each
witness,
what
is
your
answer
to
question
one,
question
two
and
question
three.
and
lastly
the
court
in
its
charge
to
the
jury
followed
that.
smith
case,
as
i
said,
was
decided
in
1968.
smith
ii
which
went
in
to
an
amplified
smith
i,
which
was
the
same
defendant
back
on
a
retrial,
subsequent
appeal
after
retrial,
went
into
the
question
of
the
quantum
of
proof.
what
was
the
evidentiary
value
of
laywitnesses.
i
think
that
this
is
an
instance
and
we
are
not
suggesting
that
the
prosecutor
has
to
bam,
bam,
bam
one,
two
three
ask
the
ali
(ph)
questions
both
smith
and
now
circuit
questions.
but
he
has
got
to
some
way
elicit
to
ultimate
facts
of
that
and
now
he
failed
to
do
that,
he
used
the
type
of
witnesses
who
the
sixth
circuit
had
already
told
him,
did
not
have
proper
credentials.
in
that
1970
opinion,
they
said,
someone
who
just
sees
the
crime
for
few
minutes
and
described
the
witnesses
that
the
government
used
that
those
type
of
people
do
not
have
sufficient
knowledge
for
the
trier
of
fact
to
reach
the
ultimate
issue.
now
society,
of
course,
should
fear
and
the
tateo
and
the
wilson
case
decided
a
term
or
two
ago
by
this
court,
urge
a
balancing
of
the
equities.
but
that
is
not
the
instance
in
the
insufficient
evidence
cases.
society
should
fear
the
release
of
a
defendant
acquitted
on
the
procedural
error,
because
we
make
a
judgment
there
that
it
is
better
perhaps
to
uphold
the
principal
to
let
one
man
go
for
that
reason
than
it
is
to
insist
upon
a
conviction.
one
of
the
striking
examples
that
accords
of
this
court’s
opinion
matter,
not
long
ago
perhaps
i
think
last
term,
in
the
case
out
of
arizona
where
the
young
man
had
given
--
where
the
defendant
had
murdered
a
child
and
given
a
confession
to
police
officer
driving
back.
we
made
a
decision
that
it
was
better
that
that
would
be
suppressed
and
perhaps
that
defendant
may
have
been
ultimately
released
as
a
societal
balancing
of
the
interest.
but
that
is
not
true
in
the
present
case,
because,
as
i
say,
we
had
no
interest
in
keeping
a
man
where
the
evidence
was
insufficient
to
convict
him,
forget
the
double
jeopardy
clause
and
all
it
needs
for
a
moment
that
society
that
has
no
interest
where
a
court
of
appeals
has
looked
at
the
proof,
everything
there
and
has
found
that
the
government
has
not
made
the
case
against
the
man.
furthermore,
there
is
no
difference
between
raising
the
issue
of
insufficient
evidence
of
trial
in
on
appeal.
i
think
this
rule
would
conserve
judicial
energy
very
large,
and
that
sometimes
trial
judges
may
let
cases
go
on
appeal
thinking
that
the
appellate
court
might
sort
all
this
out,
whereas
the
defense
counsel
in
trial
issues
should
perhaps
to
be
more
diligent
in
doing
that.
now,
injustice
can
be
exasperated
and
the
defendant
cannot
make
warrant.
in
the
present
case,
for
example,
defendant
has
not
made
warrant
in
the
other
cases,
i
suspect.
mr.
bart
c.
durham,
iii
if
you
restricted
to
retrials
for
insufficiency
of
evidence,
i
think
one
can
make
an
argument
that
appellate
courts
get
a
feel
that
this
man
is
probably
guilty
and
that
it
is
an
in
interest
about
anything
annunciated
criteria,
they
get
a
feeling
that
he
should
be
retried.
mr.
bart
c.
durham,
iii
i
think
that
in
most
practices
that
historically
--
and
there
has
been
no
differentiation
between
the
justice
in
the
federal
courts
as
between
reversals
for
procedural
as
opposed
to
reversals
for
insufficiency
of
the
evidence.
mr.
bart
c.
durham,
iii
i
do
not
think
that
it
has
ever
been
considered
and
it
comes
up
that
often,
but
that
would
be
--
i
would
urge
this
court
rule
on
the
constitutional
basis
firstly
and
secondly
i
would
urge
it
rule
on
the
statutory
basis
and
under
its
supervisory
powers
over
the
lower
federal
courts
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
under
section
2106.
society
has
no
interest
in
retrying
no
evidence
cases,
the
time
that
is
--
mr.
bart
c.
durham,
iii
yes
sir,
i
think
you
could
look
at
the
sixth
circuit
and
say
that
they
have
done
two
or
three
different
things
with
the
different
cases.
the
rosenberger
case
cited
in
my
brief
in
this
case,
one
they
acquitted
and
one
they
did
not.
i
cited
the
illinois
case
from
illinois
bar
journal
article
in
which
the
commentator
makes
a
motion,
makes
a
point
that
in
a
rape
case
out
of
illinois,
two
men
two
separate
times
committed
rape.
one
did
not
match
up
to
the
(inaudible)
rule,
the
other
did.
so
they
sent
one
back
for
a
retrial
and
they
acquitted
one.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
bart
c.
durham,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
bart
c.
durham,
iii
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
to
give
the
chief
justice
a
better
answer
to
the
last
question
that
he
asked
me.
the
question
was,
did
i
see
any
alternative
between
an
acquittal
and
a
new
trial?
i
suppose
that
i
would
not
argue
for
absolutist
rule
here.
i
think
you
might
find
exceptions.
solicitor
general
has
pointed
out
some
with
which
i
might
agree,
some
he
has
pointed
out
then
where
the
defendant
was
prevented
or
the
defendant
himself
prevented
the
government
from
going
forward.
for
example,
in
smith
i
case
in
1968
in
the
sixth
circuit,
the
defendant
in
midtrial
imposed
the
insanity
defense,
but
he
would
not
take
it
him
himself
and
he
would
not
allow
a
recess
would
not
submit
to
an
examination,
and
the
sixth
circuit
said
that
was
his
own
fault
and
he
should
not
profit,
because
it
is
a
well-known
principle
of
law.
counsel
for
the
united
states
brought
up
other
exceptions,
a
changing
presumption
or
inference
that
district
court
might
not
be
aware
of
or
variance
between
pleading
and
the
proof,
and
some
of
those
--
this
court
i
do
not
think
is
absolutely
required
in
order
to
decide
this
case
to
render
such
an
absolutist
opinion,
and
the
contours
of
this
decision
might
well
be
left
a
later
day.
but
the
facts
of
this
case
i
think
are
such
that
we
are
not
going
anywhere
near
the
limits
that
he
urges.
and
lastly
mr.
justice
powell
mentioned
the
bass
rule,
and
i
have
mentioned
the
smith
rule
in
the
sixth
circuit,
strangely
enough
that
the
sixth
circuit
in
this
case
adapted
the
bass
rule
and
the
fifth
circuit.
but
now
as
i
read
the
bass
case
that
sends
it
back
for
a
vague
balancing
of
the
equities,
but
the
language
that
bass
used
it
says
the
government
got
anymore
evidence
they
would
want
to
use.
well,
we
do
not
want
that,
we
want
what
they
did
in
1968
in
the
sixth
circuit,
what
the
sixth
circuit
has
done
before,
it
says
the
government
has
got
a
reason
why
they
did
not
use
the
evidence,
not
only
if
they
have
just
got
more
evidence,
but
a-
they
have
got
more
evidence
and
b
-
there
are
some
good
reason
why
they
did
not
do
that.
so
we
certainly
do
not
agree
with
the
bass
decision
at
all.
thank
you.
