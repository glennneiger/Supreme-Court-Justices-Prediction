mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
least
since
1896
when
united
states
against
ball
was
decided,
it
has
been
settled
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
imposes
no
limitations
on
the
power
to
retry
a
defendant
who
after
being
convicted
at
trial
succeeds
in
having
his
conviction
set
aside.
the
principle
of
this
all
is
the
double
jeopardy
clause
and
this
court
applied
it
in
the
bryan
case
to
reverse
all
for
insufficient
evidence.
bryan
squarely
controls
this
case
and
in
our
view,
the
open
question
is
whether
and
to
what
extent
bryan
should
be
reexamined.
petitioner
here
like
petitioner
in
the
preceding
case
invokes
a
syllogism.
it
runs
like
this.
one
-
if
the
evidence
is
insufficient
to
support
a
conviction
the
court
should
grant
a
judgment
of
acquittal
without
submitting
the
case
to
the
jury.
two
-
if
the
trial
judge
grants
such
a
judgment
of
acquittal,
the
double
jeopardy
clause
bars
a
second
trial.
three
-
a
reversal
on
appeal
because
of
insufficient
evidence
amounts
to
a
determination
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
trial
judge
should
have
granted
that
motion.
four
-
since
what
should
have
been
done
ought
to
be
treated
as
if
it
had
been
done,
this
case
should
be
treated
as
if
the
judge
had
granted
the
judgment
of
acquittal
and
the
double
jeopardy
clause
therefore
bars
another
trial.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we
have
in
the
past
taken
issue
with
the
soundness
of
that
second
premise;
we
took
issue
with
it
at
martin
linen,
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
argued
in
the
lee
case
that
a
decision
by
the
judge
should
be
treated
the
same
as
a
dismissal
of
the
indictment,
but
that
is
being
settled
my
martin
linen.
for
the
purpose
of
this
case,
we
take
issue
with
the
conclusion
and
the
part
of
the
fourth
premise
that
is
a
conclusion
rather
than
a
premise.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that
is
right.
we
think
the
syllogism
suffers
from
excessive
attention
to
form
a
rule
that
an
acquittal
by
the
judge
is
final
and
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
bars
a
second
trial.
it
is
justified
as
a
means
to
protect
the
ability
of
the
defendant
to
receive
a
verdict
of
the
jury
and
to
protect
his
interest
in
an
acquittal
that
he
actually
obtains.
but
it
requires
a
leap
to
say
that
a
person
who
was
not
acquitted
a
trial
deserves
the
same
treatment.
this
case
does
not
requires
speculation
about
what
a
jury
would
had
been
done
if
given
the
chance.
it
was
given
the
chance,
and
it
returned
a
verdict
of
guilty.
this
case
does
not
involve
the
defendant’s
interest
in
preserving
a
disposition
in
his
favor.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we
believe
it
is
your
honor.
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
prosecutor
presented
prima
facie
case
that
the
defendant
robbed
the
bank,
and
indeed
on
appeal
the
defendant
conceded
that
he
robbed
the
bank.
all
of
the
testimony
that
his
psychiatrist
gave
explained
why
he
robbed
the
bank.
what
internal
compulsion
drove
him
to
become
a
bank
robber?
we
believe
for
that
reason
this
case
falls
well
within
the
argument
the
tateo
that
there
is
a
category
of
cases
in
which
the
public
has
interest
in
avoiding
see
and
goes
who
are
actually
guilty
of
crime
go
free
because
we
never
have
made
a
trial.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes,
your
honor
it
was,
defendant
pleaded
guilty
during
the
trial
in
tateo.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that
is
true,
and
in
that
sense
ultimately
sanity
is
not
owned
to
the
offense.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
agree
with
that
one,
and
when
i
am
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
is
a
common
law
matter
in
the
federal
courts.
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
davis
case
was
that
as
a
matter
of
federal
common
law,
sanity
is
part
of
the
offense.
but
in
federal
cases
the
usual
order
of
proof
is
proof
of
the
commission
of
the
offense
than
the
defendant’s
proof
of
sanity,
of
insanity
and
then
the
prosecutor’s
expert
skill
take
the
stand.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
there
is
at
least
for
constitutional
purpose
mr.
chief
justice.
the
court
held
in
leland
against
oregon
that
it
is
a
constitutional
matter,
sanity
need
not
to
be
part
of
the
offense,
and
that
the
defendant
can
be
required
to
prove
lack
of
sanity.
for
that
purpose,
there
is
a
difference
between
those
elements
of
the
offense
that
the
constitution
requires
to
be
proven
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
and
that
includes
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
robbed
the
bank,
and
those
elements
that
the
constitution
does
not
refer
to
be
so
proven
and
that
the
defendant
indeed
could
be
required
constitutionally
to
prove.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes,
your
honor.
my
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question
may
be
more
easily
understood
once
i
have
established
some
of
the
premises
of
my
argument.
i
would
like
to
turn
back
in
that
direction.
i
was
trying
to
discuss
the
reasons
why
an
actual
acquittal
at
trial
has
been
thought
to
deserve
special
rule
of
finality.
my
point
then
was
that
petitioner
was
actually
not
acquitted
at
trial;
he
had
no
interest
in
that
sort
of
finality
that
he
was
seeking
to
preserve.
in
fact,
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
judge
and
all
12
jurors
concluded
that
his
sanity
had
been
proven
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
on
the
evidence
that
they
heard.
petitioner’s
argument
rests
on
a
form
of
symmetry.
if
i
had
been
acquitted,
i
could
not
be
retried;
since
i
should
have
been
acquitted,
i
should
not
be
retried.
but
the
argument
from
symmetry
is
weak,
because
it
slights
the
reasons
for
giving
special
force
to
an
acquittal
that
actually
took
place,
and
it
slights
the
rule
that
reversals
on
appeal
of
a
conviction
at
trial
always
have
been
treated
differently.
it
is
hard
to
see
why
a
non-obvious
defect
in
the
evidence.
the
defect
is
so
subtle
that
it
was
missed
by
the
prosecutor,
by
the
judge
and
by
all
12
jurors
should
confer
automatic
immunity
from
prosecution.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
your
honor
that
court
of
appeals
did
say
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
am
sorry
your
honor,
i
could
not
understand
the
question.--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
that
the
evidence
of
saturday
was
insufficient.
it
is
sometimes
necessary,
we
think
in
cases
like
this,
to
determine
what
the
court
meant
by
that.
as
judge
leventhal
said
in
the
willey
case
on
which
we
have
relied
heavily
in
our
brief,
court
of
appeals
sometimes
use
evidence,
use
language
of
insufficiency
when
they
mean
something
else.
court
of
appeals
might
have
meant
two
some
things
else
in
this
case.
the
first
something
else
it
might
have
meant
was
that
the
prosecutor
should
have
asked
his
expert
witnesses
point
blank,
the
question
whether
the
defendant
was
substantially
capable
of
conforming
his
conduct
to
the
requirements
of
the
law
and
not
having
ask
that
question
point
black
and
gotten
an
answer,
he
had
not
put
on
a
form
of
evidence
that
the
court
of
appeals
wants
in
insanity
cases.
but
that
might
not
mean
that
the
jury
was
prescribed
from
inferring
from
the
other
things
those
psychiatrists
said.
how
they
would
have
answered
that
question
if
it
had
been
asked?
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
think
mr.
justice
stevens
that
the
evidence
should
have
been
so
taken
and
indeed
there
is
a
strong
argument
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
was
wrong
in
its
evaluation
of
the
evidence
precisely
because
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we
did
not
cross
petition
and
we
did
not
raise
it
as
an
argument
in
support
of
the
judgment.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
understand
that
we
do.
my
point
in
making
this
point
was
that
even
taking
the
case
that
way
there
are
many
varieties
of
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
that
comes
in
different
shapes
and
colors,
and
it
is
not
all
of
the
same
as
if
the
prosecutor
for
an
unexplained
reason
had
simply
neglected
to
prove
that
the
defendant
robbed
the
bank.
the
other
way
to
put
this
i
think
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
might
try
the
answer
in
a
slightly
different
way.
wherever
you
draw
the
line
between
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
and
insufficiency
of
the
evidence,
some
cases
are
going
to
be
very
close
to
that
line
on
either
side.
court
of
appeals
has
confronted
with
a
very
difficult
question
when
it
gets
that
kind
of
case.
if
it
has
two
alternatives
and
two
alternatives
only,
reversing
the
conviction
outright
and
discharging
the
defendant
on
the
one
hand
and
affirming
the
conviction
outright
on
the
other
hand,
it
may
be
influenced
in
making
its
decision
as
the
court
said
in
tateo
by
the
fact
that
it
believes
that
there
has
been
a
prima
facie
case
of
guilt
and
that
the
technical
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
is
really
not
enough
to
bar
a
conviction
of
someone
who
in
the
court's
view
is
actually
guilty.
if
it
views
the
case
that
way,
it
may
be
inclined
to
err
on
the
side
of
affirmance
if
it
has
only
two
options.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
would
have
the
duty.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
question
is
how
it
resolves
doubt.
there
is
doubt
in
many
of
these
cases
and
some
rules
are
necessary
for
resolving
it,
if
it
ends
up
resolving
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
this
is
on
direct
appeal.
if
it
ends
up
resolving
doubt
in
those
kinds
of
cases,
in
favor
of
affirmance,
that
is
a
rule
that
is
probably
not
beneficial
for
defendants
as
a
group.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
one
of
the
concerns,
one
that
i
think
is
important,
is
how
the
court
of
appeals
is
going
to
deal
with
the
cases
in
which
it
has
substantial
doubt,
in
which
it
finds
itself
on
the
raiser’s
edge
between
conviction
and
outright
dismissal
of
the
charges.
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
is
that
a
remand
for
a
second
trial
in
that
class
of
cases
offers
the
court
of
appeals
and
defendants
as
a
group
an
attractive
option
that
avoids
the
great
dilemma
that
it
might
otherwise
be
in.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
agree
that
there
are,
and
i
am
not
suggesting
that
the
court
should
resolve
them
in
a
particular
way
in
a
particular
case.
one
of
the
--
i
was
using
this
as
an
argument
to
show
that
in
some
cases
that
kind
of
disposition
is
a
proper
one
and
indeed
perhaps
the
best
one
fairly
reflecting
the
inability
to
decide
whether
the
evidence
technically
described
under
the
glasser
standard
is
sufficient.
we
have
not
argued
on
the
other
hand
for
a
uniform
rule
that
such
cases
should
go
back
for
a
second
trial.
our
argument
has
been
that
the
court
of
appeals
ought
to
ask
a
number
of
questions.
the
first
is
whether
the
evidence
that
it
thought
was
missing
to
be
supplied
at
the
second
trial.
second
question
is,
whether
there
were
some
reasons
that
it
was
not
supplied
at
the
first
trial.
the
nature
of
that
reason
may
be
very
important.
the
nature
of
the
reason
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
this
is
still
on
direct
appeal.
the
nature
of
the
reason
why
it
was
not
supplied
--
excuse
me
let
me
get
back
to
your
question
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
was
not
suggesting
that
the
court
of
appeals
would
itself
address
those
questions.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
think
it
is
difficult
mr.
justice
rehnquist
to
have
clear-cut
lining
cases
like
this.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
one
reason
for
that
is
because
we
were
starting
--
at
least
i
was
starting
here
almost
by
hypothesis
with
the
class
of
cases
in
which
it
is
difficult
to
make
a
decision
under
the
glasser
standard,
but
there
are
a
variety
of
other
cases
i
think
in
which
it
is
also
difficult
to
make
a
decision.
those
are
the
classes
of
cases
in
which
you
cannot
tell
whether
the
error
is
legal
or
simple
inability
to
prove
the
offense.
there
are
many
cases
in
which
there
has
been
a
reversal,
which
purportedly
is
for
insufficient
evidence
that
may
have
other
things
underpinning
it.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we
cannot
rely
on
any
pretrial
errors
here,
but
what
i
was
suggesting
and
indeed
suggested
in
response
to
one
of
the
early
questions
was
that
this
might
be
a
case
in
which
it
is
hard
to
tell
legal
rules
and
factual
insufficiency
apart
to
the
extent
the
court
of
appeals
is
saying
that
it
believes
that
the
right
way
to
try
an
insanity
case
is
to
ask
the
point-blank
question
was
the
defendant
substantially
capable
of
conforming
his
conduct?
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
court
said
that
mr.
chief
justice,
but
that
decision
has
been
reversed
by
federal
rule
of
evidence
704,
which
was
intended
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
my
point
was
that
there
was
at
least
until
the
time
the
sixth
circuit
decided
this
case,
an
open
question
of
law
in
that
court
about
whether
those
questions
in
addition
to
being
permissible
were
also
mandatory.
the
court
of
appeals
now
seems
to
have
decided
that
they
are
mandatory,
but
that
ultimately
is
a
legal
decision
and
can
be
described
as
either
on
the
stake
of
law
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor
and
not
having
recognized
that
before
trial
or
as
a
failure
of
proof.
i
think
there
are
a
lot
of
other
examples
of
that.
for
example,
suppose
hearsay
evidence
is
admitted
and
the
court
of
appeals
then
concludes
that
disregarding
the
improperly
admitted
hearsay
what
is
left
is
insufficient.
is
that
insufficiency
the
evidence
or
an
error
of
admitting
the
hearsay?
suppose
the
district
court
misunderstands
some
of
the
elements
of
the
offense
and
calls
on
the
prosecutor
to
prove
fewer
than
all
of
them
or
take
a
claim
of
variance
between
the
charge
and
the
proof,
which
comes
up
especially
often
in
conspiracy
cases.
that
can
be
seen
either
as
too
little
proof
of
the
particular
conspiracy
charged
in
the
indictment
or
too
much
proof
of
other
conspiracies.
suppose
the
prosecutor
proves
an
offense,
but
not
the
one
charged
in
the
indictment,
is
that
too
little
proof
or
proof
of
something
else?
the
examples
can
go
on
and
on.
critical
evidence
can
be
suppressed
in
mid
trial
fourth
amendment
grounds
and
what
is
left
is
insufficient.
the
suppression
may
be
ironies
raising
purely
a
legal
question.
even
the
questions
the
prosecutor
asks
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
or
he
may
hold
both
at
once.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
decision
of
the
judge
may
be
--
i
think
you
were
phrasing
them
as
alternatives,
i
believe
the
judge
often
does
both
at
once.
he
says,
you
have
proved
two
conspiracies
not
one.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
as
the
judge’s
responsibility
in
that
case
maybe
to
grant
a
judgment
of
acquittal,
but
suppose
he
does
not,
the
question
is
then
what
happens.
let
me
come
back
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
those
are
all
my
hypotheticals.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
except
the
conviction.
let
me
bring
back
the
forman
case.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
think
sometimes
it
is
hard
to
say
whether
it
requires
an
acquittal.
perhaps
the
appellate
court
could
conclude
with
equal
accuracy.
there
was
really
a
defect
in
the
framing
of
the
indictment
and
that
what
should
have
happened
is
the
judge
should
have
mistried
the
case
rather
than
acquitting.
that
is
also
a
possible
acquittal.

sometimes
it
is
hard
fit
them
into
neat
categories.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
am
not
suggesting
we
dispense
with
rules.
i
think
we
have
suggested
one.
but
let
me
try
once
more
with
the
forman
case,
one
that
fits
in,
i
think
fairly,
clearly
to
your
hypothetical
with
the
added
wrinkle
that
the
district
judge
was
wrong.
defendant
is
charged
with
income
tax
evasion.
he
is
charged
about
six
years
after
the
return
was
due
to
be
filed.
his
contention
is
that
he
cannot
be
convicted
unless
the
prosecution
proves
the
subsidiary
conspiracy
to
conceal,
because
that
is
the
only
thing
within
the
statute
of
limitations.
the
district
judge
agrees
with
him
whole
heartedly
and
charges
the
jury
on
a
subsidiary
conspiracy
to
conceal
argument,
the
charge
that
this
court
determining
greenwall
was
erroneous.
there
was,
it
turns
out,
absolutely
no
evidence
to
support
that
charge.
if
the
judge
had
believed
this
one
legal
conclusion,
he
should
have
acquitted.
if
the
jury
had
believed
the
judge’s
charge,
it
should
have
acquitted.
neither
happened,
the
jury
convicted.
the
court
of
appeals
then
sent
the
case
back
for
a
new
trial
under
the
proper
instructions.
the
defendant’s
argument
was
that
his
right
to
be
acquitted
(inaudible)
a
trial
when
he
should
have
been
acquitted,
and
this
court's
answer
was
that
did
not
make
any
difference
what
should
have
happened
at
trial.
the
fact
is
that
he
was
not
acquitted;
he
was
convicted.
so
his
interest
in
preserving
acquittal,
which
never
took
place,
simply
never
came
into
being.
that
is
the
same
thing
here.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
there
is
an
important
distinction.
the
distinction
arises
because
the
double
jeopardy
clause
was
designed
in
part
to
prevent
the
prosecutor
from
making
repeated
attempts
to
assemble
and
introduce
enough
evidence
to
convict
a
defendant.
defendant
has
an
important
interest
in
avoiding
multiple
trials,
where
the
only
difference
between
one
trial
and
another
is
the
ability
or
willingness
of
the
prosecutor
to
introduce
probative
evidence.
but
we
have
submitted
that
that
interest
is
not
enough
to
prevent
a
second
trial
in
every
event
where
you
might
characterize
the
defect
and
the
first
trial
as
insufficient
evidence.
petitioner
here
after
all
was
not
acquitted
or
deprived
of
his
opportunity
to
be
acquitted,
he
was
convicted.
allowing
second
trials
does
not
provide
an
incentive
for
prosecutorial
misconduct
or
overreaching.
it
would
be
an
exceptional
fool-hearty
prosecutor
who
intentionally
failed
to
introduce
enough
evidence
at
the
first
trial
hoping
that
in
the
teeth
of
the
lack
of
evidence,
the
jury
would
convict,
the
court
of
appeals
would
reverse
and
he
would
have
the
opportunity
to
wax
the
defendant
with
a
second
trial.
the
extraordinary,
it
does
not
happen.
the
legitimate
interest
of
the
defendant
do
deserve
recognition,
but
they
were
probably
recognized
here
by
the
nature
of
the
court
of
appeals
are
met.
this
case
was
not
remanded
mechanically
to
hold
a
second
trial.
it
was
remanded
to
determine
why
the
evidence
was
insufficient
in
the
first
trial.
to
determine
that
is
whether
this
was
a
simple
failure
of
the
prosecutor
to
put
on
evidence
that
he
had
or
a
simple
inability
to
assemble
the
evidence
or
whether
it
was
not
instead
something
more.
we
think
the
ends
of
public
justice
in
a
particular
case
should
be
the
guiding
star,
whether
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause
or
under
section
2106.
a
second
trial
is
just
inappropriate
if
the
first
trial
was
defective
because
of
a
mistake
of
law,
whether
or
not
that
mistake
ultimately
displayed
itself
in
the
insufficiency
of
the
evidence.
mistakes
of
law
are
too
common
to
permit
them
to
immunize
defendants
from
prosecution,
and
the
interest
in
accurate
resolution
of
criminal
charges
outweighs
the
defendant’s
interest
in
uniformly
avoiding
a
second
trial.
when
the
evidence
is
truly
insufficient
because
of
prosecutorial
neglect
or
inability
to
prove
the
offense,
we
think
that
the
presumption
should
be
against
a
second
trial.
a
second
trial
would
be
appropriate
if,
first,
it
appears
that
the
evidence
can
be
supplied
at
that
trial
at
a
state
trial.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we
believe
that
the
statutory
rule
and
the
constitutional
rule
should
not
be
any
different
your
honor.
that
is
in
part
because
the
court
has
said
in
jorn
and
tateo
that
the
interests
of
justice
determine
the
constitutional
propriety
of
a
second
trial,
but
it
is
really
often
a
balancing
test.
then
2106
uses
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
believe
that
that
is
the
correct
constitutional
rule.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we
have
not
expressed
an
opinion
on
that
in
part,
because
that
is
probably
most
appropriately
determined
by
the
courts
of
appeals
in
the
exercise
of
their
supervisory
power
to
determine
where
it
is
most
appropriate.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
think
too
that
those
states
should
have
the
authority
to
determine
where
this
kind
of
determination
ought
to
be
made.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
we
hope
it
is
not
entirely
ad
hoc.
it
is
certainly
no
more
ad
hoc
than
finding
when
after
a
mistrial
has
been
declared,
there
was
manifest
necessity
to
do
so,
and
we
think
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we
have
not
taken
the
view
that
one
of
those
--
that
manifest
necessity
argument
was
a
sin.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we
believe
that
they
are
your
honor.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
your
honor,
we
do
not
believe
that
would
be
too
difficult
to
apply.
i
think
we
were
attempting
in
our
brief
to
take
very
much
the
same
position
and
to
restate
it.
the
position
we
stated
was
whether
there
was
some
why
it
did
not
come
in
at
the
first
trial
and
that
is
very
much
the
same
as
asking
whether
it
was
prosecutorial
neglect
or
a
default
or
whether
it
had
some
other
cause
perhaps
in
this
understanding
of
law
or
something
other
than
simple
default.
i
think
the
standards
that
we
have
outlined
in
our
brief
are
the
same
as
the
bass
standards.
i
think
they
are
the
same
as
the
one
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
right,
the
standards
that
were
adapted
here.
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
this
case
to
allow
the
district
court
to
make
those
inquiries.
petitioner
will
not
be
tried
a
second
time
unless
the
prosecutor
can
persuade
the
district
court
that
he
has
the
evidence
the
court
of
appeals
found
wanting,
and
that
the
reason
it
was
not
offered
was
something
other
than
prosecutorial
neglect
or
default.
there
is
no
reason
to
forbid
the
district
court
for
making
those
inquiries.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
do
not
think
it
does
your
honor.
appellate
courts
now
are
by
enlarge
making
the
decision
whether
to
send
it
back
for
a
new
trial,
whether
to
acquit
outright
or
whether
to
ask
the
district
court
to
make
a
decision.
under
2106,
the
court
of
appeals
has
the
undoubted
power
simply
to
order
the
defendant
acquitted
and
to
stop
it
there.
since
it
has
that
power
it
must
have
some
grounds
for
deciding
when
to
do
that
and
when
to
do
something
else.
you
would
ask
that
question
now
in
every
case
and
we
think
that
the
standards
we
have
suggested
for
asking
that
question
are
more
helpful
to
the
courts
and
certainly
do
not
require
it
to
embark
on
any
inquiry
that
it
is
now
not
making.
thank
you
very
much.
