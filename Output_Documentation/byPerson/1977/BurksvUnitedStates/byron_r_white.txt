what
do
you
think
underlie
the
federal
rule
that
you
disagree
with?
can
the
policy
or
a
judgment
underlies
or
justifies
the
federal
rule,
bryan
for
example?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
federal
rule
is
a
representative
of
the
most
state
practices
or
not?
what
do
you
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
burden
of
proof
is
something
else.
i
think
you
have
already
said
but
let
me
be
sure
that
i
understand
it
that
you
would
concede,
would
you
not
that
an
insane
person
cannot
be
guilty
of
a
criminal
offense,
if
he
is
insane
at
the
time
of
a
conduct,
which
for
on
the
part
of
a
sane
person
would
be
a
criminal
offense?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
was
thinking
just
what
the
federal
rule
should
be
under
the
statute
or
are
you
talking
about
a
constitutional
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
constitutional
rule
should
be
that
if
the
appellate
court
finds
the
evidence
was
insufficient
and
there
does
not
appear
to
be
any
real
excuse
for
it,
the
constitution
requires
an
acquittal.
