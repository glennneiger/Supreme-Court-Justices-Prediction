chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
6528
burks
against
united
states.
mr.
durham
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
we
can
inquire
into
or
try
to
reevaluate
the
qualifications
of
the
witnesses?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
by
procedural
error
do
you
mean
trial
error
generally,
trial
error
as
distinguished
from
an
insufficiency
of
evidence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
there
be
any
other
kinds
or
categories
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
there
any
other
kinds
of
errors
that
could
be
raised
on
appeal
other
than
either
errors
in
the
trial
or
insufficient
evidence
to
support
the
verdict?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
defective
grand
jury?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
it
could
be
pretrial
errors.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
were
you
making
essentially
the
same
argument
that
was
made
in
the
preceding
case
which
you
heard,
but
confronted
with
the
situation
an
appellate
court
has
just
two
choices
affirm
or
reverse
and
that
there
are
no
other
alternatives?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
easterbrook.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that
this
case
is
involving,
as
it
does,
the
weight
of
the
evidence
on
his
criminal
responsibility,
is
any
different
from
the
weight
of
the
evidence
on
presence
of
the
scene
of
the
crime
or
any
other
element
of
the
crime?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
you
closed
down
on
your
response
to
my
prior
question
that
there
is
a
difference.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn’t
that
the
appropriate
inquiry
for
us,
whether
the
rule
is
in
the
long
run
going
to
be
helpful
or
harmful?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
that
is
because
the
court
--
if
i
am
tracking
you
--
that
is
because
the
court
had
some
other
handles
to
mask.
that
is
a
motion,
and
attack
on
the
conviction
that
was
based
upon
trial
errors
or
pretrial
errors
and
insufficiency
of
the
evidence,
and
by
singling
on
one
of
the
trial
errors,
the
double
jeopardy
problem
is
avoided.
but
we
cannot
rely
on
any
such
distinctions
here,
can
we?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
except
that
this
court
and
something
in
the
neighborhood
60
years
ago,
said
that
is
precisely
what
you
cannot
do.
that
is
the
question
for
the
jury
and
that
the
questions
at
the
trial
must
be
directed
at
furnishing
all
the
bits
and
pieces
from
which
the
jury
can
draw
that
inference.
that
was
in
the
disability
case
where
the
question
was
doctor
in
your
opinion
as
the
plaintiff
totally
and
permanently
disabled
and
this
court
said,
you
cannot
ask
that
kind
of
a
question.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
our
new
rules
of
evidence,
but
i
am
talking
about
the
case
law
that
is
what
you
were
addressing
yourself
to
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
might
be
hearing
with
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
case,
isn’t
that
a
fundamental
distinction
between
reviewing
a
sufficient
on
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
and
reviewing
for
all
other
purposes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
that
not
open
a
whole
new
area
of
appellate
review
up
to
now
provided
by
appellate
courts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further
counsel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
now
heard
three
double
jeopardy
cases
i
have,
two
more
to
announce
on
the
same
general
subject
but
having
heard
these,
i
will
dispose
off
them
by
simply
saying
that
in
burks
against
the
united
states,
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
the
judgments
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
to
that
court
for
proceedings,
consistent
with
our
opinion.
mr.
justice
blackmun
took
no
part
in
either
the
consideration
or
the
decision
from
the
case.
