how
about
defective
indictment?
unknown
speaker
so
you
are
suggesting
that
we,
on
a
constitutional
basis,
invalidate
a
rather
wide
majority
of
state
rules
too?
unknown
speaker
let
me
see
as
i
understand
you
that
on
the
statutory
basis
you
mean
by
holding
that
it
was
an
abusive
discretion
to
say
that
this
was
an
appropriate
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
having
the
facts
situation
here.
unknown
speaker
you
agree,
would
you
with
the
soundness
of
the
first
three
premises,
it
says,
but
not
with
the
conclusions,
isnâ€™t
it?
unknown
speaker
but
not
with
the
first
three
premises.
unknown
speaker
a
person
who
is
insane
cannot
be
guilty
of
a
crime.
unknown
speaker
the
hypothesis
in
all
of
your
hypothetical
cases,
i
assume,
that
the
trial
judge,
whatever
he
should
have
done,
did
not
do
it,
and
it
went
to
the
jury
and
there
was
a
conviction
and
now
we
are
on
appeal.
that
was
your
hypothetical.
unknown
speaker
nothing
happened
in
the
trial
court
except
the
conviction.
