mr.
judson
h.
miner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
of
this
all-white
list
is
not
a
red
heiring
in
this
case.
that
is
precisely
why
this
lawsuit
was
brought.
this
company
has,
for
years,
hired
through
mr.
dacies.
mr.
dacies
is
a
white
superintendent
who
has
run
jobs
and
worked
on
jobs.
he
has
worked
with
competent
whites
and
competent
blacks
since
1958
and
he
never
put
a
black
man
on
his
list.
he
used
that
list
not
to
fill
isolated
jobs
but
to
fill,
in
this
instance,
90%
of
the
jobs.
according
to
his
testimony,
he
used
it
to
fill
every
job
except
in
those
instances
where
his
boss
said
“on
this
job,
mr.
dacies,
you
must
hire
some
percentage
of
blacks.”
in
that
instance,
he
went
out
and
recruited
some
blacks
to
fill
some
jobs
in
alternative
methods.
it
is
not
a
small
little
practice.
it
is
the
practice
that
this
man
testified,
he
used
to
fill
all
the
jobs.
he
testified
that
he
could
do
it
that
way
because
he
had
ample
names
on
his
list
and
that
this
work
was
so
lucrative
that
he
had
no
trouble
going
out
and
recruiting
people
to
come
and
work
for
him.
there
are
three
basic
facts
in
this
case.
number
one,
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
are
fully
qualified
and
competent
bricklayers.
they
are
men
who
have
worked
in
this
industry
between
18
and
30
years.
consequently,
all
of
the
discussion
in
defendant’s
briefs
about
the
skills
necessary
to
perform
this
kind
of
work
do
not
apply
to
these
plaintiffs
because
they
are
fully
skilled.
they
simply
want
the
opportunity
to
use
those
skills
on
jobs
run
by
furnco.
secondly,
there
is
not
piece
of
evidence
in
this
record
that
a
single
bricklayer
hired
on
this
job
was
as
qualified
or
more
qualified
than
the
blacks
that
were
seeking
work
at
this
job.
mr.
judson
h.
miner
no,
it
is
just
an
individual
brought
by
those
blacks
who
sought
to
get
on
this
particular
job.
the
man
selected
to
run
this
job
was
mr.
dacies.
he
had
unfettered
discretion
as
to
who
he
would
hire
and
how
he
would
hire
for
all
but
those
limited
number
of
jobs
for
which
he
was
ordered
to
hire
some
number
of
blacks.
it
is
apparent
from
this
record
that
the
blacks
that
were
hired
come
only
from
two
sources.
number
one,
he
testified
that
when
he
got
on
the
job
and
he
was
told
to
hire
some
blacks,
he
told
his
boss
“i
do
not
know
the
telephone
numbers
of
any
blacks,
therefore
i
called
mr.
abanski
at
another
job
that
furnco
was
running.”
mr.
abanski
says
“i
will
see
if
i
have
some
who
could
do
the
work.”
then,
mr.
abanski
subsequently
sent
him
some
names.
furnco
proudly
tells
us
that
these
are
examples
of
people
that
dacies
knew
and
that
he
hired
because
he
knew
him.
they
give
us
three
examples.
they
tell
us
“that
is
mr.
branch.”
they
tell
us
“that
is
mr.
jones
and
that
is
mr.
smith.”
as
to
those
three
people,
the
record
shows
that
mr.
jones
testified
that
he
was
never
called
by
dacies.
he
got
a
telephone
call
one
night
from
his
superintendent
on
the
other
job
and
they
said
“you
better
get
over
to
the
interlake
job
tomorrow,”
and
he
reported
to
work
the
next
day.
nobody
disputed
that
testimony.
the
supervisor
and
mr.
jones
disputed
that
testimony.
mr.
branch
is
not
a
bricklayer.
he
was
called
a
gun-eyed
man.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
as
to
why
mr.
branch
was
selected
to
go
and
perform
the
gun-eyed
work
on
this
job.
as
to
mr.
smith,
we
will
show
in
our
argument
that
he
was
not
selected
with
the
whites
who
were
on
mr.
dacies’
list.
thirty-seven
whites
who
had
not
sought
work
on
this
job
were
put
to
work
before
mr.
smith.
mr.
judson
h.
miner
no.
it
is
our
position
that
has
a
--
we
cannot
look
at
the
application
end
of
it
in
isolation.
a
company
that
has
systematically
excluded
blacks
from
its
primary
source
of
employees
must
provide
some
alternative
for
minority
people
to
make
their
credentials
known.
mr.
judson
h.
miner
let
me
just
define,
perhaps
for
a
moment,
what
does
“hiring
at
the
gate”
means.
when
i
say
take
applications,
i
would
say,
yes,
if
taking
applications
means
offering
some
alternative
so
that
minority
people
can
demonstrate
that
they
have
all
the
skills
requisite
to
this
kind
of
work.
mr.
judson
h.
miner
no.
mr.
judson
h.
miner
i
believe
the
question
was
whether
a
company
had
turned
over
a
hiring
into
a
superintendent
and
he,
in
fact,
hired
in
a
fair
manner
and
resulted
with
10%
black
labor
force
but
they
did
not
accept
applications
whether
the
refusal
to
take
applications
was
legitimate.
i
assume
the
question
is
not
that
10%
is
a
representative
population.
our
position
would
be,
no.
what
makes
the
refusal
to
accept
applications
improper
is
the
fact
that
the
other
side
of
the
coin
is
an
intentionally
discriminatory
mechanism
that
is
historically
excluded
blacks
to
that
time.
mr.
judson
h.
miner
yes,
because
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
is
contained
in,
i
think,
page
a6
of
the
appendix.
it
is
in
one
paragraph.
what
that
paragraph
said
was
“in
light
of
historical
discrimination,
in
light
of
historical
unequal
treatment
of
blacks,”
i
think
they
must
have
meant
by
dacies
because
that
is
the
only
evidence
in
this
record.
a
practice
is
prima
facie
racial
discrimination
if
it
refuses
to
consider
minority
job
seekers
when
the
alternative
is
to
hire
off
an
all-white
discriminatorily
created
list.
mr.
judson
h.
miner
if
this
job
had
been
initiated
in
1981,
and
in
1981,
the
evidence
was
that
mr.
dacies
had
worked
from
1958
to
1981
without
blacks
and
whites
and
his
list
was
all
white,
and
it
was
in
1981
that
his
boss
said
“now,
we
will
start
hiring
blacks.”
mr.
judson
h.
miner
he
hired
only
whites
off
of
his
list.
mr.
judson
h.
miner
that
is
right,
but
there
are
two
segments
of
this
hiring
process.
mr.
judson
h.
miner
you
have
that
case,
i
think,
before
you
right
now
and
i
think
that
there
will
just
be
a
whole
number
of
factors
that
go
to
determine
whether
the
--
mr.
judson
h.
miner
if
what
he
had
done
was
either
abolish
the
intensity
of
discriminatory
practice.
mr.
judson
h.
miner
which
was
the
creation
and
use
for
at
least
90%
of
the
jobs
of
an
all-white
list
or
he
had
integrated
the
pool.
in
other
words,
he
had
created
an
opportunity
for
minority
people
to
get
their
names
before
him
and
in
some
representative
number
so
that,
indeed,
he
now
had
a
totally
integrated
and
properly
constituted
pool.
then,
we
would
have
a
different
case.
but,
we
do
not
have
that.
what
we
have
is
a
case
where
90%
of
the
jobs
are
filled
by
the
superintendent
who
he
calls
off
of
his
all-white
list
and
10%
of
the
jobs
are
filled
through
referrals
from
other
superintendents.
mr.
judson
h.
miner
if
the
effect
of
that
was,
indeed,
to
abolish
the
practice
and
was
to
totally
integrate
the
pool
of
people
among
whom
the
selections
were
being
made,
we
would
have
a
different
problem.
but,
that
is
not
what
happened
here.
what
in
fact
happened
was
he
had
an
all-white
list
that
was
used
to
fill
a
significant
percentage
of
jobs.
his
boss
said
“fill
10%
of
your
jobs
with
these
minority
people
so
that
we
had
integrated
the
workforce
but
there
is
no
evidence
that
we
had
integrated
in
any
way
the
process
that
went
into
the
filling
of
those
jobs.”
mr.
judson
h.
miner
the
record
in
this
case
is
that
there
were
three
phases
of
hiring.
there
was
hiring
that
went
on
prior
to
the
end
of
september
in
1971.
during
that
period
of
time,
according
to
mr.
dacies’
testimony,
he
fills
37.
mr.
judson
h.
miner
this
is
what
i
am
talking
about,
this
job.
this
job
during
the
first
segment
through
the
end
of
september
he
hires
41
bricklayers.
37
of
them
are
whites
who
he
calls
off
of
his
list.
four
of
them
are
blacks
who
come
to
him
through
another
superintendent,
mr.
abanski.
one
of
them
is
the
brother
of
one
of
those
fellows.
that
is
the
first
phase.
then,
we
get
a
telephone
call
from
mr.
wright
who
is
his
boss.
according
to
mr.
dacies,
wright
called
him
and
said
“there
is
going
to
be
some
allegation
or
something
and
here
are
six
or
eight
black
names,”
and
he
hires
those
people
during
the
second
phase.
then,
the
third
phase
of
the
job
is
after
he
hires
them,
he
reverts
to
his
old
practice
and
fills
the
last
seven
jobs,
again,
off
of
his
list
and
they
are
all
white.
all
i
am
saying
is
that
there
is
nothing
in
this
evidence
that
suggest
that
that
practice
was
either
abolished
or
neutralized.
we
do
have,
through
the
so-called
affirmative
action
program,
some
blacks
being
transferred
to
this
job
site.
mr.
judson
h.
miner
i
am
suggesting
that,
certainly
blacks
who
come
to
the
job
site
and
certainly
blacks
who
have
worked
for
mr.
dacie
before
and
went
to
the
trouble
of
coming
to
the
job
site
to
get
on
should
be
considered.
i
am
suggesting
that
if
the
alternative
to
rejecting
other
blacks
who
had
tried
to
seek
out
jobs
is
to
revert
to
this
all-white
intentionally
created
list,
then
they
too
have
a
claim
that
they
too
should
have
been
considered.
mr.
judson
h.
miner
the
evidence
is
that
he,
since
1958,
had
worked
with
competent
whites
and
competent
blacks
and
that
he
had
never
put
a
black
man
on
his
list.
in
fact,
we
asked
him
whether
he
had
ever
hired
a
blackman
prior
to
1969.
he
said,
no.
then,
there
is
some
question
confusing
as
to
whether
he
claims
he
had
hired
a
blackman
on
a
job
in’69.
although
at
that
time,
he
had
no
blacks
on
his
list,
so
if
he
did
hire
him,
he
would
have
had
to
hire
him
at
the
gates.
mr.
judson
h.
miner
that
is
right.
we
are
not
suggesting
he
was,
but
he
worked
with
blacks
at
least
two
or
three
jobs
after
’64
and
he
still
had
never
put
a
competent
black
man
on
his
list.
mr.
judson
h.
miner
no.
i
think
that
there
has
to
be
an
effect,
but
i
think
that
we
have
effect
in
this
case.
mr.
judson
h.
miner
there
are
two
levels
of
analyses.
one
is
under
mcdonnell
douglas.
we
are
not
looking
at
actual
effect.
we
are
looking
at
whether
there
was
some
unequal
treatment.
i
would
say
that
if
a
employer
had
a
device
that
was
intentionally
discriminatory
and
it
excluded
qualified
blacks
from
50%
of
the
jobs
that
its
use
for
50%
of
the
jobs
is
still
discriminatory
as
to
blacks
who
were
seeking
those
jobs.
if,
in
fact,
no
blacks
are
available
and
if
in
fact
what
happened
was
that
they
had
to
go
out
and
recruit
to
fill
all
the
jobs,
then
we
would
have
a
different
story.
but
if,
in
fact,
they
needed
100
people
and
100
blacks
came
and
applied
and
they
were
all
qualified
and
they
hired
50%
of
them
because
they
were
told
to
have
50%
blacks
but
they
excluded
the
other
50%
because
their
hiring
mechanism
excluded
blacks,
then
those
50%
who
were
excluded
would
have
a
claim.
mr.
judson
h.
miner
i
am
assuming
all-black
applicants.
if
there
are
white
applicants,
then
it
becomes
a
question
as
to
the
facts
of
that
particular
case.
what
is
the
percentage
of
blacks
and
whites?
what
evidence
is
there
that
the
intentionally
discriminatory
device
is
excluding
the
blacks,
is
keeping
the
black
off
of
the
job
site?
mr.
judson
h.
miner
in
terms
of
the
number
of
people
on
the
job,
during
the
first
phase
of
the
job,
the
number
of
blacks
hired
is
approximately
10%.
there
is
a
dispute
as
to
what
the
relevant
labor
market
is.
the
trial
court
had
not
permitted
us
to
offer
evidence
as
to
what
we
thought
the
relevant
labor
market
was
which
was
made
up
of
the
particular
bricklayers’
union.
mr.
judson
h.
miner
the
district
court
adapted
data
that
was
introduced
by
the
defendants
after
he
had
rejected
our
data
as
to
what
the
racial
composition
of
the
union
that
was
responsible
for
that
jurisdiction.
mr.
judson
h.
miner
pardon?
mr.
judson
h.
miner
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
judge
abused
his
discretion
in
refusing
to
consider
our
evidence
and
therefore,
in
effect,
set
aside.
but,
those
statistics
were
not
pertinent
to
their
analysis.
the
reason
for
that
was
that
the
seventh
circuit
applied
a
strict
mcdonnell
douglas
analysis
and,
as
this
court
has
said,
under
the
mcdonnell
douglas
case
statistics
are
not
controlling.
they
may
be
relevant
but
the
question
was
dacies’
motive.
why
was
dacies’
list
all-white
and
why
did
dacies
fill
90%
of
those
jobs
off
of
his
all-white
list
even
though
during
that
period
mr.
smith
is
there
whom
he
has
worked
with
on
four
separate
occasions,
whom
he
knows
to
be
fully
qualified?
other
blacks
are
there
seeking
work
and
he
does
not
hire
them.
he
hires
37
whites
after
mr.
smith
has
come
to
the
job
site
and
those
37
were
all
on
his
list
and
none
of
them
had
sought
work.
the
statistics
of
furnco’s
hiring
as
a
result
of
orders
from
their
boss
does
not
tell
us
anything
about
dacies’
motive.
in
fact,
the
only
thing
that
tells
us
about
dacies’
motive
is
dacies’
conduct
at
the
job
site.
the
evidence
there
is
that
dacies
was
evasive
to
the
blacks
who
came.
he
was
deceitful.
he
told
blacks
that
he
was
not
hiring
when
he
was
hiring.
he
never
told
a
single
black
that
this
was
not
the
way.
mr.
judson
h.
miner
that
is
right.
mr.
judson
h.
miner
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
dispute.
i
do
not
think
there
is
much
room
for
dispute
over
the
inference.
the
fact
is
that
the
man,
to
the
extent
that
he
had
unfettered
discretion.
mr.
judson
h.
miner
pardon?
mr.
judson
h.
miner
the
district
court
makes
no
findings
about
the
existence
of
the
list.
the
district
court
makes
no
findings
about
any
of
the
elements
of
the
hiring
practice.
the
district
court
focuses
just
on
the
refusal
to
hire
at
the
gate
and
then
makes
some
conclusion
or
findings.
mr.
judson
h.
miner
i
think
that
the
district
court’s
findings
simply
said
that
the
practice
was
non-discriminatory
and
was
necessary
without
getting
into
any
of
the
elements
and
the
subsidiary
facts
that
went
into
the
whole
hiring
practice.
that
was
all
lost
over
by
the
trial
court
and
that
is
where
the
seventh
circuit
differs.
the
seventh
circuit
went
to
the
specific
facts
that
related
to
the
hiring
practice.
these
facts
were
un-controverted
and
were
all
in
the
record.
they
were
not
dealt
with
the
files.
based
on
those
un-contradicted
facts,
they
concluded
that
the
real
problem
was
not
the
no
hiring
at
the
gate
but
the
fact
that
no
hiring
at
the
gate
was
just
the
other
side
of
the
claim,
the
use
of
the
all-white
list.
in
90%
of
the
cases,
blacks
were
turned
away
in
favor
of
whites
who
were
on
this
list
because,
for
20
years,
this
man
had
never
put
a
black
bricklayer
on
his
list.
mr.
judson
h.
miner
i
think
they
did.
i
think
that
is
what
the
seventh
circuit
said.
mr.
judson
h.
miner
what
they
say
is
that
in
light
of
the
historical
discrimination.
what
they
must
mean
in
that
is
dacies,
because
it
is
dacies
that
all
the
focus
is
on.
they
do
not,
in
their
opinion,
say
“in
light
of
dacies’
intention
of
discrimination.”
but,
they
do
talk
about
“in
light
of
the
historical
discrimination,
the
refusal
to
consider
these
people
at
the
job
site
when
the
alternative
is
to
hire
off
an
all-white
list
is
discriminatory.
i
think
we
are
going
to
read
that
as
referring
to
mr.
dacies.
i
would
interpret
it
to
say
“yes,
that
practice
is
intentionally
discriminatory.”
mr.
judson
h.
miner
what
the
seventh
circuit
said
was
that
those
findings
do
not
deal
with
the
subsidiary
facts
that
went
into
the
explanation
of
how
that
hiring
practice
worked.
looking
at
those
facts
that
explain
the
intricacies
of
the
hiring
practice
which
the
seventh
circuit
found
to
be
perfectly
clear,
the
seventh
circuit
said
that
they
were
discriminatory,
that
they
were
not
job
related,
and
that
they
indeed
did
exclude
blacks
from
every
job
filled
off
of
that
list.
mr.
judson
h.
miner
no,
there
is
not.
the
seventh
circuit
goes
off
on
other
facts.
it
says
that
these
are
the
relevant
facts
to
the
proper
analysis
of
this
case.
this
is
what
the
plaintiff
has
been
focusing
on
from
day
one
and
these
facts
are
undisputed.
the
district
court
never
deals
with
these
things.
the
district
court’s
facts,
and
we
spell
this
out
in
our
briefs,
i
think
are
certainly
suspect.
the
problem
with
these
facts,
there
are
findings
in
it
that
are,
we
had
argued,
were
clearly
erroneous.
they
do
not
become
relevant
to
the
seventh
circuit’s
analysis
of
the
case.
but,
the
judge
says
that
the
practice
of
the
industry
were
statued.
the
judge
objective
himself
and
excluded
evidence
throughout
the
trial
as
to
what
the
practices
of
the
industry
were.
he
makes
a
finding
that
dacies’
practice
is
efficient
and
effective.
the
only
question
in
the
whole
trial
was
a
question
of
me
to
mr.
dacies.
do
you
have
any
reason
to
believe
that
your
practice
is
more
efficient
or
more
effective
than
any
other
practice?
the
judge
objected.
for
the
defendant,
he
did
not
answer
the
question.
the
judge,
in
his
findings,
has
a
finding
that
dacies’
practice
is
more
efficient
and
more
effective
than
any
other
practice.
i
think,
in
fact,
there
is
some
question
as
to
whether
those
findings
deserve
the
traditional
way.
but,
the
seventh
circuit
did
not
get
to
that
point
because,
in
light
of
their
analysis
of
the
problem,
they
did
not
have
to
reverse
any
of
the
judge’s
findings
of
fact.
they
were
able
to
base
it
exclusively
on
un-contradicted
facts
that
were
on
the
record
that
explained
in
detail
the
hiring
practices
of
this
company.
mr.
judson
h.
miner
that
is
correct.
mr.
judson
h.
miner
i
guess
that
is
right.
there
is
a
conflict
there
and
i
think
that
simply
goes
out
from
the
fact
that
the
district
court
just
did
not
weigh
any
of
the
facts
that
led
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
intentional
discrimination
which
is
the
creation
and
use
of
this
list.
mr.
judson
h.
miner
if
the
other
side
of
the
coin
is
to
fill
either
all
jobs
of
an
intentionally
discriminatory
device
or,
certainly,
the
majority
of
those
jobs
when
other
jobs
are
merely
filled
because
the
boss
says
“get
certain
numbers
of
blacks
in
a
certain
number
of
these
jobs.”
mr.
judson
h.
miner
i
do
not
think
so,
because
the
question
then
is
there
were
two
people
doing
the
hiring.
there
is
mr.
dacies
who
is
hiring
90%
of
the
people
off
of
his
list
and
there
is
his
boss
who
is,
in
effect,
transferring
some
number
of
blacks
to
the
job
site.
the
overall
statistics
may
well
tell
us
a
lot
about
what
furnco’s
ultimate
goal
is.
they
do
not
tell
us
anything
about
dacies.
they
do
not
tell
us
anything
about
why
dacies
met
mr.
smith
at
the
job
site
on
the
day
when
this
job
was
starting
and
he
is
under
directions
to
get
16%
blacks
and
he
does
not
hire
mr.
smith.
he
does
not
ask
mr.
smith
“who
are
these
other
blacks
here?
are
they
competent
bricklayers?
i
am
supposed
to
find
black
bricklayers.”
we
asked
him
why
he
did
not
and
he
said
“i
do
not
hire
at
the
gate.”
that
is
not
a
sincere
answer
to
the
problem.
mr.
judson
h.
miner
but
he
knew
smith
and
he
knew
smith’s
qualifications.
mr.
judson
h.
miner
but
not
until
after.
mr.
judson
h.
miner
that
is
right.
mr.
judson
h.
miner
pardon?
mr.
judson
h.
miner
i
would
submit
that
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
whites
came
to
the
gate.
the
evidence
in
this
record
is
that,
historically,
this
is
the
way
blacks
have
gotten
work
in
this
industry.
they
had
gone
from
job
site
to
job
site.
the
no
hiring
at
the
gate
policy
is
dacies’.
it
is
not
furnco’s.
every
black
who
testified
in
this
trial,
who
had
worked
in
the
firebrick
industry
had
only
gotten
on
the
job
because
he
had
gone
to
a
job
site
and
he
was
hired
then.
not
one
black
before
this
trial
had
ever
received
a
telephone
call
from
a
superintendent
saying
“come
on
out,
mr.
smith
or
mr.
samuels,
i
have
got
a
job
going.”
that
is
how
blacks
got
jobs.
it
was
dacies
who
imposed
as
an
absolute
policy
the
refusal
to
consider
people
at
the
gate
and
the
alternative
for
him
in
filling
90%
of
the
jobs
was
his
all-white
list.
mr.
judson
h.
miner
but
dacies
is
their
agent
who
is
given
the
responsibility.
mr.
judson
h.
miner
we
parsed
out
and
focused
on
dacies
because
that
is
the
way
their
hiring
operation
is
handled.
mr.
judson
h.
miner
that
is
right.
mr.
judson
h.
miner
our
contention
is
still,
one
as
dacies’
portion
is
intentionally
discriminatory
and
excludes
all
blacks.
mr.
judson
h.
miner
i
think
so.
mr.
judson
h.
miner
but
furnco
adapts
those
attitudes
because
it
is
furnco
who's
vice
president,
never
really
supervises,
never
made
any
inquiries
as
to
how
dacies
was
hiring.
they
had
no
mechanism
for
determining
whether
in
fact
dacies
was
relying
primarily
on
whites
or
whether
dacies’
primary
practices
would
lead
naturally
to
an
integrated
workforce.
they
had
given
him
his
head
and
he
had
basically
unfettered
discretion
to
hire
who
he
wanted
to.
consequently,
i
think
they
are
responsible
for
his
actions.
in
the
case
of
smith,
we
submitted
that
there
was
a
clear
instance
of
intentional
discrimination
because
he
had
worked
for
dacies.
the
primary
argument
of
the
defendant
is
that
the
exclusion
from
the
list
was
not
discriminatory
as
to
mr.
smith,
primarily
because
he
was
not
part
of
the
so-called
batiste
litigation
that
was
a
settlement
negotiation
that
was
going
on.
in
fact,
when
he
was
not
the
list,
he
was
on
mr.
dacies’
hit.
the
fact
is,
number
one,
it
is
factually
wrong.
mr.
smith
was,
prior
to
the
batiste
settlement
negotiation
and
that
is
spelled
out
in
detail
in
an
affidavit
that
is
part
of
the
record
in
a
motion
in
limine
in
which
plaintiff’s
counsel
and
mr.
glick
spells
out
that
the
settlement
negotiations
are
not
limited
to
this
batiste
case
but
they
involved
a
case
called
orphan
v.
furnco.
smith
is
a
party
to
that
litigation.
smith
was
involved
in
some
of
those
negotiations.
smith’s
name
does
not
come
to
dacies
until
precisely
the
same
time
that
wright
calls
mr.
dacies
and
says
“we
should
hire
six
or
eight
people.”
furthermore,
it
is
absolutely
clear
from
this
record
that
by
not
being
on
the
list,
smith
had
a
handicap.
he
was
not
going
to
be
considered
and
37
whites
were
considered
and
the
only
thing
they
had
different
from
him
was
that
they
were
on
the
list.
they
had
never
sought
to
get
work.
mr.
smith
had
sought
to
get
work.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
burden
was
theirs
to
show
that
even
if
he
had
been
on
the
list,
he
would
not
have
been
hired
any
earlier.
they
certainly
could
not
have
established
that
because,
at
the
time
he
was
applying
and
making
himself
available,
they
were
looking
for
bricklayers.
they
hired
41
after
he
first
made
himself
available
and
they
were
told
to
get
16%
blacks.
i
think
the
only
conclusion
to
draw
is
if
he
had
been
on
the
list,
he
would
have
been
hired
earlier.
mr.
judson
h.
miner
the
general
manager
testified
that
he
called.
mr.
judson
h.
miner
no.
mr.
judson
h.
miner
it
came
on
there.
the
second
question
is
how
the
use
of
that
list
affects
someone
like
mr.
nemhard.
mr.
judson
h.
miner
we
think
that
mr.
samuels
was
at
that
job.
we
think
that
the
evidence
in
this
case
was
that
samuels
worked
at
the
us
steel
southworks
job.
mr.
dacies
worked
the
us
steel
southworks
job.
mr.
dacies
takes
credit
for
having
worked
at
that
job
when
several
blacks
were
there.
mr.
samuels
was
one
of
the
first
blacks
hired
on
that
job.
mr.
samuel
says
“i
did
not
work
for
mr.
dacies,”
when
he
was
asked
that
question.
it
turns
out,
in
fact,
he
was
hired
by
mr.
larkin
and
he
worked
for
mr.
larkin.
but,
to
clarify
that,
i
asked
mr.
dacies
“name
the
blacks
who
were
on
that
job
when
you
were
there.”
the
imposing
counsel
objected.
now,
they
say
“had
we
not
objected
and
had
we
let
him
answer
that
question,
he
would
have
said
no
and
he
would
not
have
named
samuels”
and
they
pointed
out
some
interrogatories
which
were
not
in
the
record.
i
would
say
that,
based
on
the
evidence
we
have
where
samuels
was
on
that
job,
dacies
says
there
were
several
black
men
there
and
samuels
was
one
of
the
first
there.
it
is
more
likely
than
not
that
they
were
there
together.
but,
the
trial
court
made
no
finding
on
that
important
question.
i
do
not
think
that
the
evidence
in
the
interrogatories
disputes
particular
in
light
of
their
objection
to
my
question.
mr.
judson
h.
miner
no,
even
if
he
was
not
in
smith’s
class,
he
is
in
the
same
position
as
nemhard.
as
for
nemhard,
we
would
submit
that
the
intentional
discrimination
still
exclude
him
from
the
job.
the
analysis
goes
something
like
this,
mr.
dacies
created
an
all-white
list
during
the
period
prior
to
this
job.
his
intention
in
creating
that
list
was
not
limited
to
excluding
the
smiths
and
people
he
worked
with
in
the
past.
his
intention
is
just
as
much
to
have
an
all-white
list
to
use
in
the
future
and,
therefore,
to
exclude
those
blacks
who
will
come
down
the
road
in
the
future
for
jobs
that
he
is
looking
at.
consequently,
when
he
applies
that
list
to
a
black
who
is
coming
down
in
the
future,
that
race
is
a
factor
in
the
decision
of
the
use
of
that
list,
viz-a-viz
that
black.
furthermore,
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
once
as
this
court
has
said
in
keys,
when
you
have
intentional
discrimination
as
to
one
side
of
a
practice,
you
have
to
infer
discrimination
to
the
other
side
of
the
practice.
the
other
side
of
the
practice
is
the
no
hiring
at
the
gate.
the
inference
of
that
intentional
discriminatory
is
fully
buttressed
by
mr.
dacies’
treatment
of
the
blacks
who
came
to
the
job
site.
his
deceptive
treatment
of
them,
his
refusal
to
tell
them
how
they
can
go
about
getting
jobs,
he
almost
runs
nemhard
over
with
his
car.
smith
testifies
at
a
later
date
that
he
had
a
conversation
with
dacies
in
which
dacies
said
“if
you
had
not
been
with
those
other
guys,
i
would
have
hired
you.”
this
is
certainly
not
consistent
with
an
attitude
of
a
man
who
is
out
to
offer
a
new
equal
opportunity
to
blacks
looking
for
work.
