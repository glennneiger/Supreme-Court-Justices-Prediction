mr.
joel
h.
kaplan
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court.
this
case
concerns
several
issues
regarding
alleged
racial
discrimination
in
hiring
and
recruiting
under
civil
rights
laws,
principally,
title
7,
1964
civil
rights
act.
more
particularly,
the
case
brings
into
focus
questions
relating
to,
one,
what
constitutes
legitimate
non-discriminatory
reasons
for
refusing
to
hire
minority
applicants
under
mcdonnell
douglas?
second,
the
standard
of
review
to
be
applied
by
court
of
appeals
after
district
court
has
found
an
employer’s
refusal
to
hire
were
legitimate
and
non-discriminatory.
also,
the
court
of
appeals’
authority
unrestrained
by
either
the
evidence
in
the
record
or
the
district
court’s
finding
to
create
its
own
hiring
system.
third,
it
deals
with
the
use
and
probative
value
of
statistics
by
a
defendant
in
title
7
cases.
and,
particularly
whether
under
title
7,
a
hiring
process
which
resulted
in
the
hiring
of
black
bricklayers,
far
in
excess
of
their
statistical
availability
in
the
relevant
labor
market
can
be
fragmented
into
its
various
subparts.
finally,
it
raises
the
issue
of
whether
discriminatory
intent
or
motive
or
essential
elements
to
a
prima
facie
case
of
disparate
treatment
under
mcdonnell
douglas.
the
genesis
of
this
case
is
the
relining
of
the
blast
furnace
by
furnco
at
interlake,
inc.
in
the
late
summer
and
early
fall
of
1971.
performing
this
work,
furnco
hired
fire
bricklayers,
a
very
unique
bricklaying
craft.
the
agencies
confronting
furnco
in
performing
this
work,
in
terms
of
the
speed
it
had
to
perform
it,
in
terms
of
the
quality
of
the
work
that
had
to
be
performed
and
the
risks
of
doing
it
in
untimely
or
improper
manner
are
set
forth
at
length
in
our
brief
and
also
in
the
district
court’s
findings
that
need
not
be
recounted
here.
in
meeting
these
needs,
furnco,
through
its
job
superintendent,
followed
three
fundamental
hiring
policies.
first,
it
only
hired
bricklayers
known
by
its
superintendent
or
recommended
to
them
as
such
to
be
experienced
and
highly
competent
in
this
unique
skill
of
bricklaying.
it
essentially
hired
bricklayers
with
a
proven
track
record
of
skill
and
ability.
second,
it
did
not
accept
applications
from
anyone.
it
did
not
hire
at
the
gate.
it
is
undisputed
that
neither
blacks
nor
whites
were
hired
at
the
gate.
mr.
joel
h.
kaplan
that
is
not
true,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
h.
kaplan
that
is
not
true.
it
is
alleged.
i
think
you
are
referring
to
both
the
amici's
and
the
respondent’s
point
that
mr.
samuels
and
mr.
smith
were
not
hired.
the
first
point
issued
in
our
reply
brief
we
pointed
out
at
length
is
that
donald
samuels
had
never
worked
for
days,
as
i
questioned
in
their
by
myself,
“did
you
ever
worked
for
mr.
dacies?”
answered
“no,
i
had
not.”
so,
he
had
never
worked
for
mr.
dacies.
the
second
gentleman,
mr.
william
smith,
was
hired
on
this
job.
mr.
joel
h.
kaplan
no,
your
honor.
the
evidence
shows
that
mr.
smith
had
worked
for
mr.
dacies
previously.
at
one
point,
mr.
dacies
had
met
mr.
smith
at
the
job
site
and
said
words
in
effect
“smithy,
what
are
you
doing
here?
go
home.
i
am
going
to
hire
you.”
the
evidence
shows
that
mr.
smith
was
hired
in
a
non-discriminatory
sequence
of
hiring.
he
was
hired
before
white
bricklayers.
for
example,
he
was
hired
before
seven
white
bricklayers
who
were
purportedly
on
this
list
and
worked
longer
than
11
white
bricklayers
who
were
purportedly
on
this
list.
mr.
joel
h.
kaplan
i
think
the
list
is
really
a
red
heiring
in
this
particular
case.
the
list
signified
persons
who
were
known
by
dacies.
mr.
dacies
had
mr.
smith’s
name
in
his
head
rather
than
on
a
piece
of
paper.
he
was
hired
because
he
knew
dacies.
he
was
hired
in
a
manner
that
was
not
dissimilar
to
the
way
white
bricklayers
were
hired.
in
that
regard,
the
evidence
showed
that
blacks
worked
on
the
average,
the
same
number
of
days
as
white
bricklayers
and
were
hired
throughout
the
whole
sequence
of
the
job.
the
third
policy
pursued
by
furnco
in
hiring
on
this
job
was
that
it
sought
to
recruit
and
hire
black
bricklayers
who
were
experienced
and
skilled
in
fire
bricklayering
in
numbers
substantially
in
excess
of
their
statistical
presence
in
the
relevant
labor
force.
the
district
court
found
and
the
evidence
showed
that
during
the
relevant
time
period,
5.7%
of
the
bricklayers
in
the
relevant
labor
market
were
black.
on
the
interlake
job,
furnco
worked
black
bricklayers
13.3%
of
the
man-days.
essentially,
black
bricklayers
worked
on
this
job
at
two-and-a
half
times
their
availability
in
the
labor
force.
mr.
joel
h.
kaplan
i
am
saying
samuels
had
never
worked
for
dacies.
mr.
joel
h.
kaplan
the
list
were
various
scraps
of
paper
that
mr.
dacies
kept
that
contained
the
names
of
various
bricklayers
he
had
worked
with
and
who
were
skilled
in
firebricking.
mr.
smith’s
name
was
not
on
that
list.
it
was
not
on
a
scrap
of
paper.
however,
mr.
smith
was
known
by
mr.
dacies
and
he
was
hired
because
he
was
known
by
mr.
dacies.
to
get
right
to
that
issue
then
of
the
list
that
seems
to
be
all
pervasive
in
this
case,
the
all-white
list
is
a
very
catchy
slogan.
it
is
wholly
unrelated
to
this
case.
it
is
a
red
herring.
mr.
joel
h.
kaplan
that
is
true.
however,
prior
to
the
job,
mr.
dacies
was
instructed
by
the
company’s
general
manager
to
make
sure
that
black
bricklayers
were
hired
on
this
job
in
numbers
substantially
in
excess
of
their
ability
in
the
labor
force.
mr.
dacies
wanted
new
black
bricklayer
prior
to
this
job
and,
prior
to
the
job,
contacted
another
furnco
superintendent
in
the
area
to
obtain
the
names
of
other
black
bricklayers.
mr.
joel
h.
kaplan
there
is
none.
he
was
never
asked
that
question,
your
honor.
the
critical
point
is
that
prior
to
the
hiring
of
bricklayers
in
this
job,
mr.
dacies
had
the
names
of
black
and
white
bricklayers.
he
was
hiring
from
an
integrated
pool.
by
hiring
from
this
integrated
pool,
the
evidence
shows
that
he
was
able
to
accomplish
an
integrated
workforce,
integrated
in
terms
of
days’
work,
in
terms
of
numbers
hired,
in
terms
of
every
conceivable
way.
one
additional
point,
there
is
no
showing
that
this
purported
all-white
list
was
the
exclusive
avenue
for
obtaining
work
in
this
job.
it
was
only
one
of
several
recruitment
sources
used
by
the
job
superintendent
in
hiring
on
this
job.
the
very
fact
that
blacks
were
hired
in
the
numbers,
they
were
evidences
that
fact
that
it
was
not
exclusive,
that
being
on
the
list
was
not
a
prerequisite
for
being
hired.
mr.
joel
h.
kaplan
yes,
one,
who
was
recommended.
there
were
two
people
recommended
by
person
working
on
the
job
and
one
white
was.
as
i
was
noting,
the
district
court
had
found
that
the
hiring
policies
we
pursued
on
this
job
were
legitimate,
non-discriminatory
and
had
ruled
in
our
favor
against
all
eight
plaintiffs.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
this
at
three
and
affirmed
this
to
five.
the
court
of
appeals,
in
doing
so,
completely
ignored
the
legitimate
non-discriminatory
nature
of
furnco’s
hiring
on
this
job.
its
decision
is
totally
at
odds
with
the
evidence
before
the
district
court.
it
also
chose
to
ignore
the
statistics
in
this
case
demonstrating
the
absence
of
racial
discrimination.
this
court
has
often
said
that
in
racial
discrimination
cases,
statistics
tell
much.
here,
they
tell
that
furnco’s
hiring
policies
were
non-discriminatory.
mr.
joel
h.
kaplan
i
understand
that,
but
that
is
not
the
case
here.
the
case
is
whether
or
not
you
can
infer
racial
discrimination
from
what
is
going
on.
i
think
what
statistics
said
that
in
the
absence
of
such
blatant
kinds
of
purposeful
discrimination,
“no
blacks
need
apply.”
there
was
no
sign
at
the
gate
“blacks
need
not
apply.”
in
the
absence
of
direct
evidence,
statistics
tell
you
what
is
the
environment
in
which
hiring
and
employment
decisions
are
being
made.
i
suggest
that
the
statistics
in
this
case
tell
that
the
environment
in
which
the
hiring
was
going
on
was
not
that
furnco
was
discriminating
against
blacks
but
that
furnco
was
purposely
seeking
blacks
out,
purposely
trying
to
recruit
blacks.
this
is
best
evidenced,
i
think,
by
the
statistics.
mr.
joel
h.
kaplan
i
do
not
think
that
makes
a
difference,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
h.
kaplan
but,
i
do
not
think
it
would
have
made
a
difference
in
this
case.
certainly,
the
form
of
it
would
have
been
“he
has
got
an
integrated
list.
that
looks
nicer.”
but,
the
form
of
it
makes
no
difference
in
the
substance.
the
point
is
that
blacks
were
hired
early
on
in
this
job
and
hired
throughout
the
period
of
the
job.
there
was
no
evidence
that
they
were
disparately
treated
in
terms
of
the
time
they
worked
on
the
job.
their
absence
from
the
list
is
a
matter
of
form.
it
is
not
a
matter
of
substance
of
racial
discrimination.
mr.
joel
h.
kaplan
there
was
no
quota
at
play
here.
that
is
considered,
for
example,
by
the
amici,
the
government
and
the
eoc.
what
the
evidence
shows
is
that
there
was
a
pool
of
bricklayers,
black
and
white,
and
that
we
pulled
people
out
of
the
pool
to
hire.
mr.
joel
h.
kaplan
no,
i
would
not.
mr.
joel
h.
kaplan
i
would
think
that
there
would
be
a
great
risk
in
that
regard.
but,
the
point
is
that
that
really
what
we
are
talking
about
in
those
cases
are
selection
that
we
are
selecting
people
solely
because
of
their
skin
color.
i
think
what
is
occurring
here
is
recruitment
of
blacks
and
whites
and
bringing
them
into
a
pool
and
then
taking
bricklayers
out
of
the
pool.
mr.
joel
h.
kaplan
yes.
mr.
joel
h.
kaplan
that
is
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
h.
kaplan
it
is
a
big
deal
in
that
neither
one
of
them
was
discriminated
against,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
h.
kaplan
undermine
the
essence
of
the
hiring
system.
mr.
joel
h.
kaplan
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but,
i
want
to
go
back
to
that
list.
particularly,
again,
samuels
never
worked
for
mr.
dacies
and
his
exclusion
from
dacies’
mind
or
list
is
obvious,
because
he
has
never
worked
for
him.
mr.
smith
had
worked
for
dacies
previously.
mr.
dacies
meets
mr.
smith
at
the
job
site
and
says
“smithy,
go
home.
i
am
going
to
hire
you.”
he
hires
him
and
he
hires
him,
as
the
evidence
shows,
as
part
of
a
non-discriminatory
sequence
of
hiring.
there
is
no
showing
that
mr.
smith
should
have
been
the
first
person
hired.
if
he
did
not
have
to
be
the
first
person
hired,
when
did
he
have
to
be
hired?
i
suggest
the
evidence
shows
that
blacks
were
hired
throughout
the
period
of
the
job.
that
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world.
mr.
smith
was
not
hired
at
the
end
of
the
job
because
he
was
black.
there
were
blacks
hired
early
on.
he
was
just
hired
towards
the
end
of
the
job
because
that
was
the
way
it
happened.
mr.
joel
h.
kaplan
apparently,
there
were
some
arguments
made
about
a
refusal
to
hire
at
the
gate
was
discriminatory
or
a
refusal
to
take
applications
was
discriminatory.
i
do
not
believe
that
they
raised
any
issues
of
discrimination
for
the
very
basic
reason
that
there
is
no
showing
of
disparate
racial
impact
here.
on
the
contrary,
the
evidence
points
in
exactly
the
opposite
direction.
mr.
joel
h.
kaplan
i
think
what
was
going
on
here,
your
honor,
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
apply
a
proper
standard
of
review
and,
in
fact,
applied
no
standard
of
review
and
rather
created
its
own
hiring
system
and
created
facts
that
were
not
in
existence.
for
example,
they
say
that
“we
see
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
our
hiring
system
that
we
created
out
of
thin
air
is
infeasible.”
the
point
of
the
matter
is,
is
that
every
single
person
who
testified
and
who
had
any
experience
as
a
mason
contractor
said
that
they
would
have
hired
the
way
we
hired
and
there
was
no
evidence
whatsoever
that
their
“feasible”
system
was
in
fact
feasible,
but
anybody
had
ever
built
a
blast
furnace
that
way.
to
make
the
point
about
the
statistics
in
this
case,
that
is
in
the
impact
of
the
statistics
here
of
using
the
castaneda
and
hazelwood
methodology,
the
statistic
show
that
blacks
were
hired
at
14
standard
deviations
greater
than
the
expected
number.
that
does
not
show
purposeful
discrimination.
it
shows
purposeful
bringing
blacks
in.
back
to
the
all-white
list
for
a
moment.
concentrating
on
the
all-white
list
is
wrong
not
only
because
there
was
an
integrated
pool
prior
to
the
job,
but
it
also
represents
an
attempt
to
fragment
and
parsed
the
hiring
process
to
look
at
each
individual
source
of
hiring
and
saying
“what
is
the
racial,
ethnic,
sexual,
religious
composition
of
that?”
rather
than
looking
at
the
results
of
the
entire
hiring
process.
i
suggest
that
that
kind
of
parsing
up
is
not
only
inconsistent
with
the
case
law,
but
leads
to
ludicrous
results.
that,
no
employer
in
this
country
would
not
have
a
hiring
system
that
did
not
discriminate
if
that
was
a
rule.
it
would
be
impossible
to
have
any
source
that
precisely
reflected
that
kind
of
protected
category
makeup.
indeed,
there
is
no
evidence
to
show
that
the
hiring
system
found
“feasible”
by
the
court
of
appeals
or
urged
by
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
passed
muster
under
that
kind
of
standard.
one
of
the
fatal
defects
of
the
court
of
appeals’
system
is
that
there
is
no
showing
that
it
would
have
created
job
opportunities
for
blacks
in
excess
of
what
our
system
created.
in
fact,
the
evidence
is
exactly
the
opposite.
that
if
you
had
a
completely
random
system,
as
the
court
of
appeals
seem
to
say
we
need
it,
that
only
5.7%
of
the
mandates
in
the
job
would
have
been
worked
by
blacks
instead
of
our
13.3%.
mr.
joel
h.
kaplan
i
agree
with
you.
that
is
not
a
sufficient
answer
where
he
says
“i
am
not
going
to
hire
you
because
you
are
black.”
but,
that
is
not
the
case
here.
mr.
joel
h.
kaplan
that
is
right.
the
court
of
appeals
said
this
case
fell
under
mcdonnell
douglas.
in
doing
so,
i
think
it
made
two
fatal
errors,
first
of
all,
in
saying
that
there
was
ever
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination
in
the
first
place.
i
think
what
mcdonnell
douglas
says
is
how
were
similarly
situated
whites
treated?
the
answer
is,
similarly
situated
whites
who
appeared
at
the
gate
seeking
employment
--
mr.
joel
h.
kaplan
i
am
sorry?
mr.
joel
h.
kaplan
no,
similarly
situated
whites.
that
they
had
disparate
treatment.
the
evidence
showed
that
whites
appearing
at
the
job
site
gate
did
not
get
jobs.
there
was
never
a
prima
facie
showing
of
discrimination
and
nor
was
there
a
showing
of
discrimination.
mr.
joel
h.
kaplan
it
may
have
been
fraught
with
discrimination.
mr.
joel
h.
kaplan
what
they
said
is
that
a
subjective
hiring
system
mends
itself
to
discrimination.
there
were
two
difficulties
with
that.
one,
that
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
case
of
discrimination
and
the
cases
of
this
court,
and
all
the
other
courts,
so
that
you
may
have
a
subject
of
hiring
system
as
long
as
it
does
not--
mr.
joel
h.
kaplan
i
think
our
hiring,
in
the
first
place,
was
fair.
the
question
is
whether
we
would
have
had
to
take
applications
at
the
gate.
mr.
joel
h.
kaplan
i
understand
that.
mr.
joel
h.
kaplan
under
the
court
of
appeals’
decision,
we
would
have
had
to
take
applications
at
the
gate.
mr.
joel
h.
kaplan
absolutely.
mr.
joel
h.
kaplan
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
joel
h.
kaplan
there
is.
the
question
relating
prior
thereto
was
to
the
list,
your
honor.
there
is
no
showing
that
if
we
had
hired
at
the
gate,
that
it
would
have
resulted
in
the
same
kind
of
non-discriminatory
hiring
that
we
in
fact
had
on
this
job.
we
were
talking
about
the
fragmenting
of
the
hiring
system.
it
seems
to
me
that
title
7
does
not
prescribe
that
there
are
good
hiring
systems
and
bad
hiring
systems
in
terms
of
the
kinds
of
ways
you
recruit
workers.
it
does
not
say
you
have
to
go
to
help
wanted
ads
or
tv
advertising
or
write
letters
to
every
potential
applicant.
it
says
“whether
or
not
the
sources
that
you
chose
or
the
recruitment
sources
you
use,
whether
or
not
those
are
discriminatory
or
non-discriminatory,
whether
or
not
they
have
a
disparate
impact
on
blacks
or
any
other
protected
minority.”
the
answer
in
this
case
is
that
the
selection
of
recruitment
sources
that
we
chose
did
not
have
such
a
disparate
impact
and
that
to
fragment
and
parse
up
the
system
totally
distorts
the
hiring
process.
one
of
the
points
also
raised
in
the
certiorari
petition
that
i
would
like
to
comment
on
for
a
moment
is
the
question
of
whether
intent
or
motive
is
a
necessary
element
to
a
prima
facie
case
under
mcdonnell
douglas.
i
believe
that
such
a
showing
is
necessary
to
show
that
there
is
a
nexus
between
the
prohibited
criteria
and
the
action
taken,
that
there
is
a
nexus
between
refusing
to
hire
a
black
and
the
fact
that
you
are
refusing
to
hire
him
on
that
prohibited
basis.
i
think
that
the
showing
of
intent
and
motive
are
necessary
element
of
the
most
analogous
statute,
such
as
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
joel
h.
kaplan
that
is
right.
what
i
am
suggesting
here
is
that
the
circumstantial
evidence
in
this
case
completely
dispels
any
notion
that
persons
were
hired
or
not
hired
because
of
their
skin
color.
that
evidence,
again,
is
not
only
the
statistics
and
the
non-discriminatory
sequence
of
hiring,
but
also
the
treatment
of
blacks
on
the
job.
no
discriminatory
discharges,
layoffs,
no
denial
of
benefits,
nothing
of
that
nature.
mr.
joel
h.
kaplan
mr.
dacies,
who
was
the
superintendent,
did
not
talk
to
anybody
at
the
gate
other
than
smith.
these
people
went
up
to
the
gate
and
they
were,
in
a
sense,
locked
out.
mr.
joel
h.
kaplan
no,
for
the
simple
reason
that
we
did
not
take
applications
from
anybody.
mr.
joel
h.
kaplan
“go
home.”
mr.
joel
h.
kaplan
there
was
not
really
an
application.
he
said
that
i
intend
to
call
you
and
the
district
court
credited
that
testimony.
mr.
joel
h.
kaplan
i
have
a
few
points
to
make,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
in
response
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
seventh
circuit
deals
at
a7
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari.
it
says
“the
historical
inequality
of
treatment
of
black
workers
seems
to
establish
that
it
is
prima
facie
racial
discrimination,
etcetera.”
there
is
no
reference
to
dacies’
list.
there
is
no
reference
to
any
overturning
of
the
district
court’s
findings
that
there
was
no
pretext,
no
intentional
discrimination.
that
is
number
one.
mr.
joel
h.
kaplan
no,
no
reference
to
that
there
was
any
intentional
discrimination
going
on.
but
they
are
concerned
in
regard
to
dacies.
what
they
seem
to
be
concerned
about
was
societal
discrimination
against
black
workers.
that
is
how
i
read
the
sentence,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
h.
kaplan
no,
i
do
not
think
so.
i
do
not
think
that
is
true.
i
do
not
think
it
does
not
refer
to
black
job
seekers
on
this
job.
it
says
how
else
will
qualified
black
applicants
be
able
to
overcome
the
racial
imbalance
in
a
particular
craft,
itself,
to
results
of
past
discrimination?
that
is
not
relating
to
furnco.
mr.
joel
h.
kaplan
yes,
but
that
is
based
on
the
historical
inequality
treatment.
mr.
joel
h.
kaplan
that
is
what
i
assume
it
is
and
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
about
the
history
of
the
industry
as
a
whole.
mr.
joel
h.
kaplan
that
is
true.
that
mr.
dacies
had
it.
second
point,
the
evidence
is
to
the
us
steel
job.
mr.
smith
was
specifically
recruited.
he
did
not
have
to
go
to
the
gate
to
be
hired.
he
was
specifically
recruited.
on
page
five
of
our
reply
brief,
question,
“did
mr.
larkin
who
was
the
assistant
superintendent
had,
in
fact,
specifically
sought
you
out
because
you
had
worked
for
him
before?
answer,
“yes”
from
mr.
smith.
i
think
the
briefs
satisfy
my
concerns
to
record
that
this
court
be
fully
apprised
with
the
record.
the
point
i
want
to
come
back
to
is
how
should
furnco
have
hired
on
this
job?
the
eoc
and
the
us
government
concede
that
our
hiring
system
was
legitimate
and
non-discriminatory.
the
district
court
had
found
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
our
hiring
system
was
legitimate
and
non-discriminatory,
that
it
met
furnco’s
business
needs
as
well
as
not
discriminating
against
blacks.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
system
found
“feasible”
by
the
seventh
circuit
would
have
met
our
business
needs
and
have
led
to
as
many
blacks
being
hired.
indeed,
the
vice
of
the
furnco’s
hiring
system,
the
seventh
circuit
said
that
it
was
subjective,
that
somehow
the
job
superintendent
was
making
subjective
judgments.
but,
the
vice
of
the
seventh
circuit’s
system
is
that
it
is
equally
subjective.
indeed,
it
is
even
more
subjective
than
our
system.
our
system
was
premised
upon
knowledge
of
a
person’s
ability
to
do
this
very
specialized
skill.
it
was
not
premised
upon
what
strangers
had
to
say
in
terms
of
recommendations.
i
would
like
to
make
one
last
point.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
furnco
had
ever
engaged
in
any
discrimination
prior
to
this
job.
there
is
no
finding
of
any
court
or
administrative
agency
that
has
been
upheld
that
furnco
had
discriminated
against.
the
accusation
is
totally
false.
given
the
backdrop
of
no
discrimination
and
the
statistics
on
this
job
and
the
legitimacy
of
the
hiring
system
in
terms
of
meeting
our
business
needs,
i
do
not
believe
that
there
was
any
racial
discrimination
in
this
case
and
i
respectfully
request
that
you
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
as
to
those
three
respondents.
thank
you.
