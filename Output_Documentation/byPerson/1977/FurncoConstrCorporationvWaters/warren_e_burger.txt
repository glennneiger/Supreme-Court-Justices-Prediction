chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
furnco
construction
against
waters.
i
think
we
will
wait
a
little
bit
until
the
stadium
is
cleared.
mr.
kaplan,
i
think
you
may
now
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
be
taking
a
risk
if
you
did,
of
having
an
attack
made
by
the
80%
that
you
were
discriminating
and
using
a
quota
system?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
it
make
any
difference
that
this
finding
by
the
district
court
differed
from
that
of
the
court
of
appeals
because
the
court
of
appeals
undertook
and
superimposed
its
findings
on
the
record
over
the
district
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
miner?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
can
finish
your
response
to
that
at
1:00,
counsel.
you
were
in
the
process
of
responding
to
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
miner,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
you
reconcile
what
you
are
saying
now
with
the
figures,
the
statistical
factors,
in
this
case?
what
i
hear
you
saying
makes
me
think
i
read
a
different
record
from
the
one
that
i
should
have
read.
what
about
the
record
in
this
case
of
actual
hiring?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
this
particular
job
that
we
are
talking
about?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
these
figures
that
your
friend
gave
us
erroneous?
did
he
give
us
some
wrong
figures
here
today
in
his
oral
argument?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
are
the
findings
of
the
district
court
in
that
respect?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
we
have
to
accept
the
findings
of
the
district
court
or
did
you
bring
that
issue
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
you
bring
that
issue
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
seems
to
be
quite
crucial
to
your
position
that
there
is
something
wrong
and
illegal
about
not
hiring
at
the
gate.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
brings
us
back
to
the
objective
evidence
again
on
the
statistics,
does
it
not?
you
certainly
have
to
put
those
two
things
together.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
dacies
does
it,
it
is
furncoâ€™s
action,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
the
separation
of
dacies
and
furnco?
it
is
all
furnco,
is
it
not,
no
matter
who
does
it?
if
you
had
10
different
men
doing
the
hiring,
if
they
are
all
agents
and
servants
of
furnco,
why
is
that
relevant
at
all?
you
may
be
showing
that
mr.
dacies
has
some
wrong
attitudes,
but
furnco
is
the
party
in
interest
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
kaplan,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
76-369,
furnco
construction
company
against
waters
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
