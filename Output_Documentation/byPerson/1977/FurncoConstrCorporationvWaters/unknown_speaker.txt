unknown
speaker
but
he
was
not
on
the
list?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kaplan,
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
answer
to
justice
rehnquist’s
question.
are
you
saying
that
smith
and
samuels
were
on
the
list
or
that
there
was
no
list?
unknown
speaker
is
it
correct
that
there
were
writings
on
pieces
of
paper
and
only
names
of
white
persons
were
on
those
writings?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
explanation
of
why
he
did
not
write
his
name
down?
unknown
speaker
were
any
whites
hired
who
were
not
on
the
list?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kaplan,
let
me
just
follow
up
if
i
may.
i
do
not
mean
to
suggest
this
is
what
the
facts
show,
because
the
facts
are
rather
quite
confused
in
this
case.
but,
assume
that
the
evidence
did
show
that
the
company
hired
what
it
regarded
to
as
an
appropriate
quota
of
blacks
and
it
thought
that
it
had
met
its
affirmative
action
or
obligation
or
something
of
that
nature.
thereafter,
would
it
be
obligated
with
the
remaining
people
it
had
hired,
it
would
be
obligated
to
take
blacks
and
whites
indiscriminately,
would
it
not?
what
is
your
position
on
that?
unknown
speaker
you
are
answering
my
hypothetical
question
by
saying
it
is
not
this
case.
i
just
want
to
get
your
legal
position.
assume
that
you
did
affirmatively
hire,
say
15
or
20
or
whatever
the
percentage
might
be,
and
got
that
number
of
black
workers
on
the
job.
having
done
that
and,
say,
you
have
another
80%
to
hire.
would
it
be
your
view
that
you
could
then
say
“we
will
hire
only
whites”
in
the
other
80%?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
is
the
important
thing
in
this
case
not
that
you
do
not
have
to
hire
at
the
gate?
unknown
speaker
is
the
important
thing
to
you
to
sustain
this
case
not
as
though
the
list
were
not
there
at
all?
unknown
speaker
then
if
you
lose
the
case
on
these
two
just
because
there
was
a
list,
that
is
not
such
a
big
deal
for
you,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
if
they
were
not
discriminated
against
because
the
company
does
not
have
any
obligation
to
hire
at
the
gate
and
can
have
this
key
man-selection
system,
so
to
speak,
that
is
one
thing.
but,
its
the
only
reason
they
were
discriminated
against
is
because
the
foreman
had
a
list
on
which
there
were
no
blacks,
that
maybe
important
to
you
but
it
does
not
undermine
the
--
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
is
there
an
issue
in
this
case
that
even
if
there
had
not
been
a
list
that
you
were
discriminatory
or
your
client
was
discriminatory?
is
there
an
argument?
unknown
speaker
blacks?
unknown
speaker
blacks?
unknown
speaker
but
did
the
court
of
appeals
not
say
that
a
hiring
scheme,
hiring
only
employees
known
to
the
superintendent
was
too
fraught
with
potential
discrimination
to
be
permissible?
unknown
speaker
but
did
they
hold
that?
unknown
speaker
suppose
there
had
been
no
petition
for
certiorari
and
you
are
operating
under
the
court
of
appeals’
judgment
and
its
opinion.
could
you
have
maintained
this
system
without
a
list,
so
called?
after
the
court
of
appeals’
opinion,
just
told
your
superintendent
to
go
hire
but
be
fair.
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
i
am
asking
you.
unknown
speaker
under
the
court
of
appeals’
opinion.
unknown
speaker
so
there
is
an
issue
here.
you
are
attacking
that,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
the
other
side
is
defending
that.
unknown
speaker
there
must
be
an
issue
here
then.
unknown
speaker
but,
obviously,
in
order
to
prove
a
tenor
of
motive
it
is
almost
inevitably
necessary
to
rely
on
circumstantial
evidence.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kaplan,
going
back
to
the
hiring
at
the
gate
point,
i
am
just
trying
to
remember.
does
the
evidence
tell
us
when
a
man
applied
at
the
gate
and
was
told
“we
do
not
take
applications
at
the
gate,”
did
the
company
tell
them
how
he
should
apply?
unknown
speaker
was
there
any
procedure
for
letting
them
know
who
they
should
write
to
or
anything
like
that?
unknown
speaker
except
when
smith
showed
up,
dacie
said
“smithy.”
unknown
speaker
“go
home.”
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
position
that
the
company
must
take
applications?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
your
answer
is
at
least
furnco,
after
the
court
of
appeals’
opinion
any
way,
would
be
required
and
your
position
is
that
it
must
take
applications.
unknown
speaker
you
are
saying
that
any
company
that
gives
its
superintendent
cart
blanche
authority
just
to
go
out
and
hire
his
workforce.
they
tell
him
“we
need
100
persons.
now,
go
out
and
hire
them.”
he
just
hires
from
people
that
he
knows.
it
just
so
happens,
that
he
hires
10
negros
out
of
100.
you
would
say
that
is
an
invalid
system.
unknown
speaker
you
are
suggesting
then
that
any
particular
black
or
indeed
all
blacks
are
to
be
considered
for
every
particular
position.
unknown
speaker
but
your
evidence
is
that
he
just
had
a
white
list.
is
that
your
basis
for
saying
he
was
intentionally
discriminatory?
unknown
speaker
mr.
miner,
are
you
arguing
that
the
process
if
discriminatory
is
all
that
one
must
find
regardless
of
the
effect?
unknown
speaker
let
us
assume
that
instead
of
ending
up
with
13.5%
black,
the
contractor
has
said
“i
want
at
least
50%
black.
mr.
superintendent,
you
go
ahead
and
recruit
your
force
anyway
you
think
best
so
long
as
you
meet
that
standard.”
if
he
had
met
it
in
this
case
with,
say,
50-50
in
terms
of
ratio
or
portion
with
the
labor
market
at
a
of
figure
of
10%.
it
obviously
had
an
effect
but
not
favorable.
would
you
say
that
was
all
right
or
not?
unknown
speaker
even
though
300
very
highly
qualified
white
applicants
had
also
applied?
you
are
just
assuming
all-black
applicants.
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
it,
your
colleague
on
the
other
side
would
seem
to
concede
that
dacies
had
said
to
one
of
these
fellows
“i
am
just
not
ready
to
hire
you
yet.
i
am
not
just
hiring
blacks.
i
just
do
not
want
to
hire
any
blacks
right
now.”
turned
these
people
away
and
when
they
had
not
hired
the
whites.
that
kind
of
intention
of
discrimination
would
not
be
cured
by
any
kind
of
proportional
hiring.
do
you
understand
that?
unknown
speaker
is
this
an
argument
over
when
there
is
a
justifiable
inference
of
an
intentional
discrimination?
unknown
speaker
what
the
district
court
find?
unknown
speaker
what
did
the
district
court
find?
unknown
speaker
did
they
find
that
there
was
no
intentional
discrimination?
unknown
speaker
mr.
miner,
the
district
court
found,
and
i
am
looking
at
finding
number
15
on
page
18,
that
furnco’s
hiring
policies
and
practices,
and
i
skipped
a
few
words
here,
were
neutral.
again,
i
skipped
a
part
of
it.
there
is
no
evidence
that
these
policies
and
practices
either
way
pretext
to
exclude
negro
bricklayers.
all
had
a
disproportionate
impact
or
effect
on
negro
bricklayers.
did
the
court
of
appeals
conclude
and
state
that
there
was
no
substantial
evidence
to
support
those
factual
findings?
unknown
speaker
was
any
specific
finding
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
findings
of
the
fact
by
the
district
court
were
not
supported
by
evidence?
unknown
speaker
it
was
true,
as
a
matter
of
fact.
there
was
no
hiring
at
the
gate
of
blacks
or
whites.
unknown
speaker
and
smith
was
hired.
unknown
speaker
but
not
at
the
gate.
unknown
speaker
whites
too,
but
he
certainly
did
not
hire
them
at
the
gate.
unknown
speaker
he
had
knew
a
lot
of
whites
he
did
not
hire
at
the
gate.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
but
dacies
is
not
the
defendant
here,
furnco
is.
unknown
speaker
we
are
talking
about
the
overall
hiring
by
furnco.
unknown
speaker
it
is
part
of
it.
unknown
speaker
it
was
from
dacies’
list
and
part
of
it
was
from
some
other
source.
unknown
speaker
how
about
samuels?
unknown
speaker
does
samuel’s
case
depend
whether
or
not
he
was?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kaplan,
let
me
just
interrupt.
you
said
no
reference
to
the
list?
unknown
speaker
but
the
sentence
is
dealing
specifically
with
furnco
rather
than
with
society
at
large.
unknown
speaker
but
the
part
of
the
sentence
you
left
out
was
prima
facie
racial
discrimination
to
refuse
to
consider
the
qualifications
of
a
black
job
seeker
before
hiring
from
an
approved
list
containing
only
the
names
of
white
bricklayers,
and
that
is
talking
about
furnco.
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
history
of
the
industry
as
a
whole
or
furnco?
unknown
speaker
but
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
about
an
approved
list
containing
names
of
white
bricklayers
that
furnco
had.
