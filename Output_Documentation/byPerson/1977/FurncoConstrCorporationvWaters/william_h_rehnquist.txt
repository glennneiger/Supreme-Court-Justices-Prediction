justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
not
have
to
add
that
of
the
fire
bricklayers
known
to
the
superintendent
that
two
blacks
on
the
list
known
to
him
were
not
hired?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
not
true?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
after
other
white
people
who
were
not
on
the
list?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
an
employer
could,
in
a
market
where
there
were
20%
blacks
in
the
pool,
have
employed
30%
and,
nonetheless,
if
a
black
came
to
him
and
sought
employment
and
the
employer
told
the
black
“i
am
not
going
to
hire
you
because
you
are
black,”
the
fact
that
he
was
above
the
pool
ratio
would
not
excuse
him.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
a
sufficient
answer
to
a
title
7
claim
if
an
employer
refuses
a
black
a
job
specifically
on
the
ground
that
he
is
black,
for
him
to
say
“look,
i
am
already
20%
over
the
pool”?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
not
have
two
basically
different
kinds
of
cases?
one
is
the
griggs
case
where
you
are
talking
about
disparate
impact,
and
the
other
is
the
mcdonnell
douglas
where
you
are
talking
about
racially
motivated
refusal
to
hire.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
whites.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
is
not
a
class
action.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
court
of
appeals
gave
this
answer
13
years
after
the
enactment
of
title
7.
do
you
think
it
will
be
entitled
to
give
the
same
answer,
say,
23
years
afterwards?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
from
‘58
to
’64
he
was
under
no
obligation
to
hire.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
court
of
appeals
itself
make
a
specific
finding
that
dacies’
refusal
to
hire
blacks
was
racially
motivated?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
should
not
be
a
“think”
question.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
a
moment
ago
you
said
the
court
of
appeals,
at
least
inferentially,
found
that
dacies’
refusal
to
employ
was
racially
motivated.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
here,
my
brother
powell
has
pointed
out
to
you
a
finding
by
the
district
court
that
it
was
not
racially
motivated.
so,
the
court
of
appeals
did
have
to
upset
that
finding
in
the
district
court
in
order
to
justify
your
argument.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.

is
the
employer
in
this
title
7
case.
frunco
contracted
to
reline
a
blast
furnace
in
the
chicago
area,
because
of
highly
specialized
nature
of
the
work,
the
superintendent
of
the
job
did
not
accept
applications
of
the
job
site
but
rather
hired
only
brick
layers
whom
he
knew
to
be
experienced
and
competent.
respondents
fully
qualified
black
brick
layers
were
among
the
brick
layers
who
unsuccessfully
applied
for
employment
at
the
site
of
the
job.
they
brought
suit
claiming
employment
discrimination
in
violation
of
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
the
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois
in
chicago
ruled
in
favor
of
the
employer
holding
that
the
respondents
had
not
proved
a
case
of
discrimination
under
what
is
called
the
disparate-treatment
theory
of
mcdonnell
douglas
corporation
against
green,
a
case
we
decided
several
terms
ago.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
reversed
the
judgment
in
favor
of
the
employer.
it
held
that
the
respondents
had
made
out
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination
and
contrary
to
the
findings
of
the
district
court,
if
the
employer
had
not
proved
that
its
hiring
practices
were
justified
as
a
business
necessity
because
the
employer
could
have
used
alternative
hiring
practices
which
would
have
satisfied
its
business
needs
and
at
the
same
time
allowed
it
to
consider
the
maximum
number
of
minority
applicants.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
seventh
circuit.
while
the
court
of
appeals
was
justified
in
concluding
that
respondents
had
made
out
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination
under
mcdonnell
douglas,
the
court's
imposition
of
a
hiring
method
which
might
have
enabled
the
employer
to
consider
and
perhaps,
higher,
more
minority
employers,
finds
no
support
in
either
the
nature
of
the
prima
facie
case
or
the
title
vii's
purpose.
courts
may
not
impose
such
a
remedy
on
an
employer
at
least
until
a
violation
of
title
vii
has
been
proved.
