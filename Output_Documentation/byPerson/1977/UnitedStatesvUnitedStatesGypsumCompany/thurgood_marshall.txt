maybe
he
was
just
trying
to
walk.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
then
tell
me.
justice
thurgood
marshall
none
of
us
in
this
room
know
what
he
told
the
jury.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
isn't
that
a
problem?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
--
why
didn't
he
call
the
whole
jury
in
and
tell
them
his
last
statement?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
it's
already
to
tell
--
the
foreman
to
tell.
justice
thurgood
marshall
not
that
i'm
saying
that
he
could
then
have
called
the
jury
in
and
said,
“the
foreman
has
told
you
this
and
i
want
to
tell
you,
this
is
what
i
have
to
say.”
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
he
at
least
would
have
known
that
the
jury
got
the
correct
information.
