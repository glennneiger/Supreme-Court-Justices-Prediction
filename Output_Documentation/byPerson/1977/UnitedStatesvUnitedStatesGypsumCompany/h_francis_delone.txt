mr.
h.
francis
delone
i'm
sure
that
mr.
mcsweeney
meant
container
could
only
be
applied
--
applied
prospectively.
it
would
offend
the
principle
against
retroactivity.
mr.
h.
francis
delone
if
the
court
please,
i
want
to
try
to
deal
with
the
three
additional
reasons
for
which
or
--
led
justices
hunter
and
adams
to
believe
that
this
case
should
be
sent
back
for
a
new
trial.
two
of
those
deal
with
the
charges
of
the
court
with
reference
to
conspiracy.
the
third
deals
with
the
subject
of
the
hung
jury
or
jury
coercion.
to
deal
with
the
instructions,
it
is
important
to
recall
as
justice
powell
pointed
out
--
mr.
justice
powell
pointed
out
earlier,
“the
government
here
charged
a
13-year
nationwide
conspiracy
involving
all
told
some
12
defendants
and
some
160
coconspirators.”
and
this
fits
with
a
current
proclivity
if
we
might
call
with
that
of
the
antitrust
division
in
any
of
the
nationwide
price-fixing
cases
that
are
brought.
if
you'd
look
at
the
cases
brought
within
the
--
the
last
10
years,
you'll
see
the
average
duration
of
the
alleged
conspiracy
is
approximately
10
years,
five
more
than
the
statute
of
limitations.
the
government's
brief
as
you
all
have
seen
contains
what
is
really
in
their
factual
statement,
a
hodgepodge
of
separate
episodes
which
they
refer
to
as
subsidiary
agreements,
subsidiary
to
some
overall
price-fixing
agreement.
and
these
with
the
exception
of
a
couple
of
pages
out
of
the
44
are
all
agreements
which
were
alleged
to
have
occurred
back
prior
to
the
beginning
of
the
statutory
period,
prior
to
december
27,
1948
which
is
five
--
i'm
sorry
1968
which
is
five
years
prior
to
the
indictment.
to
illustrate,
included
in
their
hodgepodge
are
a
--
are
the
--
are
transaction
concerning
applicator
discounts
in
oregon
and
washington
in
1965.
another
“subsidiary
agreement”
is
a
transaction
concerning
the
withdrawal
of
wooden
pallets
in
michigan
in
1971,
and
a
third
concerns
alleged
predatory
pricing
back
in
1962
in
texas.
you
have
to
realize
there
is
such
a
hodgepodge
in
order
to
understand
the
need
for
the
instruction
which
we
sought
and
did
not
get
in
this
case
from
the
trial
court.
and
that
was
an
instruction
not
just
as
he
did
charge
that
the
jury
would
have
to
determine
first
whether
there
was
an
overall
conspiracy;
and
second,
whether
each
individual
separately
as
each
--
whether
that
individual
joined
the
conspiracy.
but
as
the
second
circuit
recognized
in
the
borelli
case
on,
which
we
modeled
our
requested
instruction,
it
was
necessary
with
all
these
separate
and
distinct
episodes
that
were
placed
before
the
jury
over
this
30-year
period.
it
was
necessary
for
something
more
to
be
said
so
that
jury
could
not
draw
from
the
fact
that
an
individual
participated,
for
instance,
in
something
to
do
with
applicator
discounts
in
1965
in
washington.
they
could
not
draw
from
that
alone
the
fact
that
--
that
that
individual
joined
some
vast
overall
conspiracy
but
rather
they
would
be
required
to
look
at
the
situation
of
that
individual
and
what
his
understanding
was
of
what
he
was
doing
and
what
he
was
joining.
we
did
not
get
such
an
instruction
as
was
requested.
and
the
prosecution
dismisses
this
as
a
semantical
nicety.
that's
the
language
which
they
picked
up
from
judge
weis'
dissent.
but
is
it
really?
if
you're
going
to
convict
individuals
in
a
case
such
as
this
a
semantical
nicety
to
require
that
they
really
know
and
understand
what
is
this
conspiracy
that
i'm
charged
with
before
they
can
be
convicted
of
it
because
that
is
really
what
we
are
dealing
with.
i
submit
the
prosecutions
claim
as
semantical
nicety
is
really
a
cynical
disregard
of
the
whole
jury
system
as
we
know
it.
and
then
the
prosecution
in
order
to
get
rid
of
the
borelli
case
says,
“there
were
--
there
was
either
one
overall
agreement
or
none
and
the
subsidiary
episodes
were
simply
manifestations
of
the
conspiracy
in
action.
they
could
not
have
taken
place
without
an
umbrella
agreement
or
understanding.”
yet
they
never
explained
nor
was
it
ever
argued
why
there
had
to
be
some
single
overall
umbrella
understanding
in
order
for
two
or
three
individuals
to
do
something
about
applicator
discounts
on
the
west
coast
or
about
pallets
in
detroit
or
to
bring
it
down
more
specifically
to
the
case
of
the
defendant
colon
brown.
there
was
only
evidence
as
judge
hunter
points
out
in
his
opinion
of
his
involvement
in
some
transactions
about
price
and
credit
in
1965
and
1966
and
judge
hunter
side
comments
that's
really
all
the
evidence
was.
what
is
there
to
suggest
that
colon
brown,
an
individual
defendant
here,
knew
from
whatever
the
jury
may
have
deduced
he
did
back
in
'65
and
'66,
that
he
was
joining
some
price-fixing
or
price
verification
conspiracy
that
continued
on
up
into
'68,
'69,
'70,
and
'71.
indeed,
judge
zirpoli
in
the
companion
civil
case
held
that
whatever
conspiracy
may
have
existed
in
'65
and
'66
was
fully
terminated
and
abandoned
by
19
--
by
january
1,
1968,
long
before
the
statute
here.
likewise,
as
to
defendant
nicely,
his
--
the
evidences
to
him
concern
almost
entirely
one
sales
call
in
texas
in
1962,
but
the
jury
was
never
told.
did
mr.
nicely
join
this
overall
conspiracy,
the
one
with
which
we
were
charged?he
never
told
to
focus
on
what
mr.
nicely's
understanding
was
when
he
made
that
phone
call.
and
we
contend
that
we
were
entitled
clearly
to
such
an
instruction
on
the
scope
and
purpose
and
the
knowledge
of
the
individual
who
allegedly
joined
the
conspiracy.
the
other
aspect
of
the
instructions
concerns
withdrawal,
and
on
that,
the
charge
is
so
brief
that
it's
easy
to
understood,
i
think,
if
i
reach
--
it's
--
the
court
said
simply,
“in
order
to
find
that
a
defendant
abandoned
or
withdrew
from
a
conspiracy
prior
to
december
27,
1968,
you
must
find
from
the
evidence
that
he
or
it
took
some
affirmative
action
to
disavow
or
defeat
its
purpose.
mere
inaction
would
not
be
enough
to
demonstrate
abandonment,”
and
so
far,
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that
charge,
we
agree
with
it.
the
court
went
on
to
withdraw,
a
defendant
either
must
have
affirmatively
notified
each
other
member
of
the
conspiracy,
he
will
no
longer
participate
in
the
undertaking,
so
they
understand
they
can
no
longer
expect
his
participation
or
of
--
or
acquiescence
or
he
must
make
disclosures
of
the
illegal
scheme
to
law
enforcement
officials.”
now,
the
government
hardly
recognizes
that
isn't
the
law,
that
isn't
the
law
as
it's
been
declared
by
this
court.
a
defendant
is
not
a
member
--
an
alleged
member
of
a
conspiracy
is
not
limited
to
just
two
ways,
notify
all
the
other
members.
here
are
some
160
or
go
to
the
cops
if
i
could
use
that
expression,
not
at
all.
you
can
disavow
participation
in
a
conspiracy
by
conduct,
but
the
court
ruled
that
out.
mr.
h.
francis
delone
on
the
bill
of
particulars
here,
i
think
we
did
have
problems
of
identifying
who
were
the
members,
but
in
any
event,
sir,
i
think
that
it's
perfectly
clear
from
the
decided
cases
of
this
court
and
the
lower
courts
that
just
as
you
can
infer
participation
in
a
conspiracy,
you
can
infer
withdrawal
so
long
as
the
conduct
which
indicates
withdrawal
is
known
to
the
others
allegedly
involved
in
the
conspiracy
--
mr.
h.
francis
delone
--
and
that's
what
we
had
here
because
we
had
evidence
of
vigorous
price,
vigorous
competition
among
these
companies
prior
to
the
beginning
of
the
statutory
period.
we
had
evidence
that
the
defendant
andrew
watt
instructed
usg
not
to
verify
at
all,
again
prior
to
the
beginning
of
the
statutory
period
as
part
of
this
competitive
scheme.
mr.
h.
francis
delone
it
was
not,
sir.
we
did
not
have
the
bill
of
particulars.
mr.
h.
francis
delone
but
--
but
basically,
to
limit
the
method
of
withdrawal
to
two
things,
one,
notify
fellow
conspirators
whoever
they
may
be
or
notify
the
law
enforcement
authorities
is,
i
think,
the
government
concedes
too
narrow
a
method
for
abandonment
or
withdrawal
and
there
was
evidence
here
which
should
have
been
submitted
to
the
jury
under
a
proper
charge
that
we
were
entitled
to
and
--
so
--
so
that
we
could
have
been
held
that
the
jury
founded
that
we
had
withdrawn
or
some
of
the
defendants
--
mr.
h.
francis
delone
--
had
withdrawn
for
the
conspiracy.
mr.
h.
francis
delone
yes.
mr.
h.
francis
delone
he
had
some
notes,
sir,
but
he
was
unable
to
repeat
his
charge
when
several
times
asked
by
the
jury
to
do
so,
so
that
he
clearly
didn't
have
a
full
script.
mr.
h.
francis
delone
yes,
it
was
an
extended
charge.
mr.
h.
francis
delone
yes,
he
did.
mr.
h.
francis
delone
well,
i
didn't
personally,
but
mr.
keck
who
represents
usg
did
and
we
had
a
ground
rule
in
the
case
that
an
objection
made
by
one
and
(voice
overlap).
mr.
h.
francis
delone
that
objection
appears
at
page
1757
of
the
transcript,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
francis
delone
and
we
had
requested
an
instruction
along
these
lines
also,
which
appears
at
1856,
i
mean
one
which
did
not
limit
us
to
these
two
methods
of
withdrawal
but
one
which
recognize
that
competitive
behavior
which
--
which
others
were
aware
would
itself
be
a
basis
for
finding
of
abandonment
or
withdrawal.
that
request
appears
at
1856
and
i
did
accept
to
the
refusal
to
give
that
or
all
of
the
points
that
he
refused
and
he
--
he
said,
"fine.
you
don't
have
to
say
anymore.
you
have
an
exception
to
any
other
points
which
you
asked
us
to
give
and
which
i
didn't.”
so
we
really
covered
it
both
ways.
and
i
might
say
the
suggestion
which
the
government
--
the
only
way
they
seem
to
--
they
just
say
it's
hardly
likely
the
jury
paid
any
attention
of
the
third
--
third
sentence
in
view
of
the
generality
of
the
first
and
second
in
this
charge.
mr.
h.
francis
delone
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
you'd
look
at
it,
counsel
never
argued
it
and
we
wouldn't
have
been
that
foolish.
if
we
know
the
judge
is
not
going
to
charge
it,
we're
not
going
to
argue
it
because
that's
the
best
way
to
have
the
jury
feel.
the
rug
has
been
pulled
out
from
under
counsel.
that's
lie
under
federal
rule
civil
procedure
30.
you'll
find
out
first,
“what's
the
judge
going
to
rule?”
so
you
know
how
to
argue
the
case
and
we
were
told
that
we
wouldn't
get
that
point.
so
we
couldn't
argue
withdrawal
and
abandonment
for
the
jury
and
--
and
you
can
search
the
speeches
and
there
is
no
argument
--
so
that's
a
hollow
privilege,
i
might
say,
if
there
could
be
one.
i'd
like
to
turn
finally
to
the
question
of
the
coerced
verdict.
this
has
to
be
viewed,
not
the
way
the
government
would
have
your
honors
view
it,
simply
taking
one
sentence.
it'll
exchange
between
the
foreman
and
the
trial
judge
at
the
end
of
their
meeting,
but
it
has
to
be
viewed
in
the
context
of
what
was
the
total
setting
of
these
jury
deliberations.
and
if
i
may,
i
want
to
take
you
through
that
as
quickly
as
i
can,
but,
so
you
may
understand
the
flavor
of
it.
the
jury
started
his
deliberations
on
tuesday,
july
the
8th
at
about
five
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
and
deliberated
from
nine
in
the
morning
until
ten
at
night,
daily,
tuesday
--
(inaudible)
tuesday,
wednesday,
thursday,
friday.
as
the
judge
questions,
asks
about
exhibits,
requests
for
further
instructions,
it
was
a
very
active,
lively
jury,
and
that
went
on
until
friday
when
we
got
worried
that
there
was
something
about
the
juror's
health
that
was
--
the
judge
called
us
into
a
meeting,
we
met
with
the
foreman
of
the
jury.
at
that
time,
the
counsel
and
the
foreman
were
all
present
and
the
judge
interrogated
the
--
the
foreman
and
we
learned
that
jurors
were
fatigued,
that
the
ladies
were
crying,
that
there
were
health
problems,
not
an
awful
lot
more
than
that
but
sufficient,
so
the
jury
begged
that
they
work
shorter
hours
and
the
judge
said
they'd
have
some
break,
shorter
time
over
the
weekend
and
we
would
work
--
they
would
only
deliberate
from
nine
until
six.
actually,
i
usually
started
a
little
earlier,
nine
i
think
but
that
was
the
official
starting
time
right
straight
along.
and
--
sorry,
i
see
that
the
--
my
time
has
gone
up
and
i
will
have
to
advert
to
the
brief
because
i
have
to
leave
mr.
bartlit
five
minutes
of
time
as
i
undertook
to
do.
it
is
in
the
brief.
the
jury
coercion
subject
is
fully
doubt
with
there
and
i
will
urge,
your
honors
because
it
is
a
very
critical
point
to
ask.
i
would
urge,
your
honors,
to
look
at
the
transcript
with
care.
it
starts
at
page
1837,
even
that
portion
where
the
judge
interrogates
the
jury
foreman
in
the
final
session
after
he
has
been
told
by
notes
from
a
jury
that
they
could
only
decide
on
the
basis
of
compassion
for
fellow
jurors
after
he's
been
told,
“no
testimony,
no
document
would
change
their
views.”
they
were
hopelessly
deadlocked.
and
at
that
time,
the
judge
tries
to
see
if
excusing
one
juror
would
help
because
we
agreed
to
take
the
verdict
of
11.
when
he
finds
that
it
won't
help,
that
both
of
them
abandoned
that
effort,
the
judge
did
as
we
contend
in
our
brief
coerced
verdict.
