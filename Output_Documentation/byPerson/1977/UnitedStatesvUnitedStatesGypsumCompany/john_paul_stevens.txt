justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
there
should
be
evidence
in
that
paragraph.
he
doesn't
say
--
it
says
it
is
sufficient
evidence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you're
--
it's
all
right
if
you
want
to
read
it,
you're
reading
it
on
paper
with
your
opponents
in
that
actual
language.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
friedman,
before
you
leave
this
aspect
of
the
case,
in
judge
hunter's
opinion
at
pages
28
and
29
of
the
cert
petition,
he
summarizes
what
he
thinks
would
be
a
proper
instruction
which
was
not
quite
given.
would
you
say
that
that
instruction,
had
it
been
given,
would
have
been
wrong?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
one
thing
you
omit
though.
he
did
in
that
paragraph
also
require
that
there
be
an
agreement
to
exchange
the
information.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
says
if
there
is
that
plus
the
effect
then
they
can
infer
purpose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let's
read
the
whole
paragraph.
you
see
a
conspiracy
to
fix
prices.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
successful
to
be
unlawful
if
there
was
such
a
thing.
maybe
we
can
(inaudible)
if
the
effect
of
such
exchanges
was
to
raise,
fix,
maintain,
or
stabilize
prices,
then
an
agreement
to
engage
in
such
an
exchange
is
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act
regardless
of
the
specific
purpose
of
the
parties
to
the
agreement
had
in
their
mind.
now,
he
surely
is
talking
about
an
agreement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it's
the
agreement
--
with
the
question,
as
i
understand,
is
whether
the
agreement
to
exchange
prices
which
had
an
adverse
effect
on
the
price
level
is
enough
to
prove
a
violation.
isn't
that
the
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
is
the
--
this
is
the
paragraph
you
contempt
as
erroneous.
this
is
the
paragraph
of
the
instruction?
yes.
