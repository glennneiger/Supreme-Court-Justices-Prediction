mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
am
going
to
deal
with
the
robinson-patman
verification
point
as
described
by
mr.
friedman
including
retroactivity.
mr.
delone
is
going
to
address
himself
to
the
other
instructions,
namely
the
one
which
judge
hunter
found
a
reversible
error
on
scope
and
purpose,
instruction
on
scope
and
purpose
and
the
abandonment
and
he
will
also
deal
with
the
question
of
the
coercion
of
the
jury.
mr.
delone
will
--
mr.
bartlit
thereafter
will
address
himself
to
some
of
the
issues
affecting
the
individuals.
i
would
say
at
the
outset,
if
i
may,
to
your
honors
that
the
question
here
is
--
is
of
course
a
very
important
one
and
more
important
than
ever
in
this
criminal
case
because
any
rule
fashioned
by
this
court
will
be
applicable
now
in
felony
cases
since
december
1974.
sherman
act
violation
is
a
felony,
and
i
say
that
because
i
want
to
emphasize,
if
i
may,
that
it
is
very
important,
i
think,
to
retain
the
law
which
is
that
even
a
price
exchange
case,
even
where
the
price
exchange
has
an
effect
of
stability,
the
element
of
purpose
in
exchanging
prices
should
not
be
emasculated,
and
that's
what
was
done.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
well
--
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
if
there
is,
mr.
justice
white,
a
conspiracy,
a
direct
agreement,
so
to
speak,
to
fix
prices,
he
doesn't
need
to
show
the
effect.
but
in
this
case,
in
this
case,
in
this
case
there
was
no
direct
agreement
to
fix
price.
there
was
only
--
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
the
jury
--
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
mr.
justice
white,
if
the
jury
has
the
option
so
that
it
could
have
found
the
defendant
guilty
on
the
basis
of
merely
an
exchange
of
prices
and
price
stability,
that
is
error.
it
should
be
upset.
that's
what
happened
here.
the
jury,
the
government
concedes
that.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
no,
they
could
use
price
stability
as
a
basis
of
an
inference
but
they
must
find
--
they
could
infer
a
purpose
which
is
what
i
think
this
court
did
in
the
container
case
from
price
stability
in
an
exchange
of
pricing
information.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
mr.
justice
white,
exactly
and
that's
the
central
point
of
this
verification
issue
and
this
case,
that's
what
--
we
don't
know
what
the
jury
found
and
the
government
shouldn't
be
talking
about
what
it
proved.
this
isn't
a
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
case.
it's
here
on
the
instructions.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
all
right,
mr.
justice
white,
i
am
confident
that
the
jury
here
was
absolutely
instructed
if
they
found
an
exchange
of
price
information
and
price
stability,
they
must
find
that
that
would
be
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act
--
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
--
that
they
could
find
on
that
basis.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
yes,
that
is
may.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
they
were
not
required,
they
were
--
but
they
were
not
--
they
were
told
to
disregard
purpose
entirely
and
if
i
may
quote
to
the
instructions
and
quoting
from
page
17,
20
--
22
of
the
record
which
is
a
little
but
in
the
charge
after.
i
believe
the
portion
that
mr.
justice
stevens
referred
to.
go
down
to
the
paragraph
which
begins
on
that
page
to
those
critical
words
regardless
of
the
specific
purpose.
very
clearly,
the
trial
court
said
to
the
jury,
you
don't
have
to
be
concerned
with
the
purpose
of
complying
with
the
robinson-patman
act
if
you
find
an
exchange
of
prices
and
price
stability,
then
you
may
find
and
that's
the
only
--
that
is
what
the
case
is
here
on
because
as
you
will
note
that
the
government
concedes
--
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
all
right,
an
agreement
to
exchange
the
information
and
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
yes,
he
--
he
instructed
--
no,
he
says,
regardless
of
the
purpose,
your
honor.
he
doesn't
--
mr.
justice
stevens,
he
doesn't
require
them
to
find
purpose,
that's
the
error
of
that
instruction.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
he's
talking
though
only
about
an
agreement
to
exchange
prices
but
not
an
agreement
to
fix
prices.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
mr.
justice
stevens
in
--
in
which
relates
back
to
the
exchange
of
prices,
i
don't
--
i
don't
--
it's
the
exchange
of
price
information
which
has
the
stabilizing
effect
whether
they
exchanged
with
an
agreement
or
not,
if
they
exchange
--
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
understand
that
mr.
chief
--
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
well,
i
would
--
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
the
act
does
not
require
a
specific
purpose
to
restrain
trade,
that's
--
that's
the
error.
he
left
that
off,
it
might
have
been.
all
right,
if
the
instruction
--
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
yes.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
well,
if
he
said
earlier,
mr.
chief
justice,
regardless
of
the
specific
purpose,
i
would
still
be
attacking
it
because
--
because
i
must
read
the
whole
--
the
whole
thing
because
that's
what
the
jury
heard,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
when
he
clearly,
from
this
instruction,
instructed
that
purpose
in
a
price
exchange
information
case
was
not
an
element
and
that's
error.
the
government
here
concedes
if
you
know
that,
the
government
brief
page
72,
in
foot
note
67,
it
says,
“the
verdict
must
be
treated
as
if
it
stored
entirely
on
the
jury's
conclusion
that
the
information
exchange
affected
prices,
that
the
information
exchange
affected
prices.”
now,
that's
not
the
way
they
charge
us
in
the
indictment
and
that
i
would
come
to
in
my
--
our
point
that
the
charge
had
a
fatal
variance.
so
the
instructions
to
the
jury
varied
from
the
charge
in
the
indictment.
that's
not
the
way
the
case
was
tried
below.
that's
not
the
way
the
prosecutor
argued
it
to
the
jury,
he
was
telling
they
had
to
find
a
purpose,
but
the
court
said,
“you
don't
have
to
find
a
purpose.”
so
the
full
--
although,
we
don't
know
from
a
general
verdict,
what
was
proved,
we
must
assume
that
the
jury
could
have
convicted
us
on
the
basis
of
an
exchange
of
price
information
and
price
stability.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
i
think
they
may
consider
it.
they
have
to
find
--
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
well,
i
think
what
the
court
of
appeals
found
to
be
erroneous
was
the
omission
from
the
charge
of
the
necessary
element
of
purpose
in
the
exchange
of
price
information.
that's
the
--
that's
the
error
here.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
i
think
if
--
yes.
i
think
it
does.
i
think
if
they
can
--
i
think
that
i'm
not
arguing
that
purpose
cannot
be
--
could
not
be
inferred
from
price
information
exchanges
and
resulting
stability
but
they
must
determine
there
was
purpose.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
i
think
the
jury
should
be
told
you
have
to
find
purpose
in
an
exchange
of
price
information
in
order
to
--
in
order
--
in
a
price
--
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
--
information
exchange
--
i
think
that
i
would
object
to
that
and
find
that
reversible
and
certainly
in
a
criminal
case
where
purpose
is
such
a
vital
element
and
especially
if
we
are
going
into
felony
cases.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
for
the
defendant,
i
would
--
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
well,
no.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
he
could
find
--
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
they
must
find
purpose.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
they
may
infer
it
from
all
the
circumstances.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
that's
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
that's
--
that's
my
position
and
i
say
that
--
that
this
has
been
the
law
for
50
--
50
years
starting
with
--
in
1925
of
maple
flooring
and
cement
manufacturers
which
were
both,
although
civil,
purpose
cases
and
cement
manufacturers,
of
course,
also
had
in
it
the
element
of
the
--
of
custom
of
fraud
with
respect
to
the
job
protection
plan.
and
those
cases
stand
for
the
proposition
that
you
must
find
in
a
price
exchange
because
we
have
a
circumstantial
case
on
the
base
of
price
exchanges
you
must
find
that
the
reason
for
exchanging
prices
was
for
the
purpose
of
fixing
prices
or
an
anticompetitive
purpose.
the
--
the
government,
of
course,
relies
heavily
here
on
the
container.
and
there,
the
court,
finding
no
controlling
circumstance
analogize
the
price
exchange
in
those
cases
to
--
to
what
had
had
already
found
to
the
cases
in
american
linseed
oil
and
american
column
&
lumber
company
which
were
purpose
cases.
i
say
that
the
container
case
that
the
court
had
to
have
been
inferring
purpose
in
that
case
though
i
recognize
that
the
case
--
that
the
court
did
not
expressly
say
that
in
its
opinion,
but
that
is
the
only
way
it
can
be
reconciled
with
the
decisions
both
before
container
and
indeed
after
container.
and
after
container,
i
mentioned
reconciliation
with
the
c&s
bank
case.
and
indeed,
the
court
itself
in
the
majority
opinion
in
container
did
reconcile
by
analogizing
two,
american
linseed
oil
and
american
column
&
lumber,
it
said,
“the
agreement
in
the
present
case,
in
the
container
case,
though
somewhat
casual
is
analogous
to
those
in
american
column
&
lumber
and
american
linseed
oil.”
but
the
trial
court,
in
our
case,
permitted
a
conviction
without
the
requisite
essential
element
of
purpose.
now,
moreover,
with
respect
to
container,
even
if
my
reading
of
container
is
not
accepted
by
this
court,
they
--
excuse
me
--
my
reading
is
that
they
had
to
infer
a
purpose,
but
if
you
read
--
if
you
read
--
if
this
court
should
read
container
to
say
all
you
need
is
information
exchange
plus
price
stability,
that
still
wouldn't
govern
here
because
they
do
recognize
the
controlling
circumstance,
whether
it's
a
doctrine
or
otherwise,
they
recognize
it
and
use
that
word.
and
they
said
a
controlling
circumstance
such
as
that
was
--
as
was
present
in
cement
would
--
would
save
a
price
information
exchange
even
if
it
had
a
stabilizing
effect.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
i
think
--
i
think
you
--
mr.
chief
justice,
you
--
thus,
you
may
infer
it
from
these
circumstances
but
you
must
infer
it
to
convict
him.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
you
must
find
it
--
find
it
whether
you
infer
it.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
you
may
use
these
circumstances
for
such
an
inference
but
whatever
basis,
you
must
find
it
to
convict
the
man.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
consider
those
circumstances,
they
must
find
the
purpose.
now,
i
refer
this
court
to
citizens
&
southern
bank
and
i
say
merely
there
in
citizens
&
southern
bank,
the
defendants
were
trying
to
avoid
violating
a
state
law,
the
anti-branch
banking
law
and
--
and
like
we
hear
in
this
case,
we're
trying
to
avoid
violating
a
federal
law,
the
robinson-patman
act.
and
there,
the
court
found
that
despite
--
despite
an
exchange
of
pricing
information
in
a
stabilizing
effect
that
there
was
not
a
violation
of
the
--
of
the
sherman
act.
i
would
like
to
talk
and
mention
briefly
that
--
that
what
is
a
variance
from
--
between
what
we
were
charged
with.
we
were
charged
with
a
purpose
case
and
that
sure
the
government
in
the
indictment
talked
about
effects
but
in
paragraphs
or
section
5
the
indictment,
they
said
what
we
were
charged
with.
in
section
6,
they
said
what
the
effects
were.
but
if
you
go
to
the
--
to
the
bill
of
particulars,
you'll
see
that
we
were
charged
very
definitely
when
it
was
explained
there
with
a
purpose
--
purpose
and
i
refer
to
page
37
of
volume
1
of
the
appendix
in
particular
is
read
paragraph
12.
it
said
--
it
said,
the
bill
of
(inaudible),
“this
mutually
agreed
upon
illegal
course
of
conduct
of
exchanging
was
for
the
purpose
of
raising
and
fixing
prices.”
finally
and
in
conclusion,
may
i
say
that
in
the
event
the
court
should
not
accept
my
reading
of
container
and
apply
container
as
the
government
reads
it,
that
should
be
applied
only
retroactively
and
--
and
it
also
should
at
--
we
should
at
least
get
the
benefit
in
a
retrial
of
the
instruction
saying
of
applying
container
only
to
the
conduct
of
the
parties
prior
to
the
decision
in
container.
thank
you.
