we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
no.
1560,
united
states
against
u.s.
gypsum.
mr.
friedman,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
that's
all
the
record
showed,
what
would
be
your
position?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
not
verifying
in
the
meeting
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
the
grass
cutter.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
begin,
but
would
it
be
occurring?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
was
even
more
extravagant
than
that
that
the
foreman
of
the
jury
reported
to
the
court
here
that
literally,
some
of
the
jurors
were
ready
to
jump
out
the
window.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that
was
a
little
hyperbole?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
--
or
a
test,
or
a
test.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
mcsweeney?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
last
(voice
overlap)--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they'd
left
off
the
five
words.
you
would
be
satisfied
with
five
or
six
words
about
purpose.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
the
last
five
or
six
words
that
mr.
justice
stevens
has
just
read
to
you
from
that
instruction.
i
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
about
purpose.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
might
have
been
or
would
have
been?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
be
attacking
it
if
he'd
left
--?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
understand
you
dissent.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(voice
overlap)
they
must
find
a
purpose.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you've
emphasized
very
--
very
properly
that
this
is
a
criminal
felony
case
as
suppose
to
take
an
analogy
that
maybe
farfetched
the
--
in
a
charge
for
the
felony
of
assault
with
intent
to
kill,
the
jury
was
instructed
to
--
to
try
to
make
it
parallel
to
this
instruction
that
if
you
find
that
the
defendant
had
a
gun
on
his
hand,
that
he
knew
it
was
loaded,
that
he
cock
the
gun
and
pointed
it
at
the
victim
and
pulled
the
trigger,
you
may
infer
an
intent
to
commit
the
crime
charged
in
the
indictment.
would
that
be
an
appropriate
charge?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
a
little
bit
to
make
it
restricted
parallel.
you
may
consider
these
circumstances
that
i've
just
described
as
evidence
of
an
intent
to
commit
the
crime
charge
and
that
--
that
would
be
an
appropriate
instruction.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
mcsweeney.
mr.
delone?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
took
it
that
it
should
not
be
applied
retroactively.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
at
that
stage
it
might
be
something
like
a
class
action
or
a
problem
of
identifying
who
was
a
member
of
the
class
of
the
conspiracy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
course
the
bill
of
particulars
identifying
all
these
people
wasn't
available
back
in
1965,
1967,
and
1968,
was
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
bartlit.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
considerably
less
than
the
allen
charge.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
there
is
a
problem
of
the
judge
telling
that
to
one
member
of
the
jury,
that
is
the
foreman
with
his
special
status
of
authority
and
depending
upon
that
individual
to
carry
the
message
back
accurately
and
faithfully
to
the
other
11?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
friedman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
then
i'll
put
to
you
the
question
that
i
had
put
to
your
friend.
how
do
we
know
that
that
very
sensitive
aspect
of
the
case
was
communicated
to
the
other
11
jurors
in
the
same
way
the
judge
communicated
it
on
the
record
to
the
foreman?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
can
assume.
i
would
assume
he
--
he
did
his
best,
but
it's
now
the
lawyer
train
the
nuances
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
mr.
friedman,
when
the
lawyers
agreed
that
he
could
receive
the
foreman
of
the
jury,
isn't
it
reasonable
that
they
should
thank
that
he
was
merely
going
to
listen
and
not
give
any
additional
instructions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
number
one
and
you
can
address
both
at
once.
and
then
number
two,
suppose
hypothetically
the
foreman
in
the
exhausted
state,
he
described
himself
and
out
of
the
jury,
went
back
into
the
jury
and
then
started
relaying
it
is
--
was
told
him
that
a
judge
went
in
and
said,
the
judge
says,
“we've
got
to
get
a
verdict.”
what
if
he
said
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that
would
--
and
if
we
knew
that,
wouldn't
you
think
that
would
taint
this
verdict?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
would
be
a
certainly
strong
policy
against
--
i
should
think
in
40
some
years,
i've
never
heard
of
a
judge
visiting
with
one
member
of
the
jury
for
anything
except
the
communication
of
the
message
by
the
jury
to
the
judge.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that's
a
very
high
policy.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
the
judgment
and
opinion
to
announce
in
76-1560,
united
states
against
the
united
states
gypsum
co.
and
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
with
clerk
this
morning,
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
is
affirmed.
mr.
justice
stewart
joins
in
all,
but
part
4
of
the
opinion.
mr.
justice
powell
filed
a
separate
opinion
concurring
in
part,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
mr.
justice
stevens,
each
filed
an
opinion
which
concurs
in
part
and
dissents
in
part.
mr.
justice
blackmun
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
