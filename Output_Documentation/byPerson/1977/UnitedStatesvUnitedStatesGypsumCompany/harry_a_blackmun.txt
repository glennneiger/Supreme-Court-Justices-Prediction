harry
a.

mr.
friedman,
what
--
what
is
the
theory
of
the
alleged
conspiracy?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
have
a
statute
of
limitations
that
operate
somewhere
in
there,
don't
you?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
68?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
my
impressions
from
your
statement
of
facts,
which
i
think
it's
about
45
pages
long,
is
that
most
of
the
facts
you
talked
about
occurred
before
the
period
involved
in
the
indictment.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
--
the
application
practice
after
1968
was
at
a
very
substantially
low
level,
as
i
gathered
from
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
do
you
read
container
as
being
unanimous
in
that
--
in
that
respect?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
or
--
or
effect.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
friedman,
before
you
go
on,
if
there
is
verification
of
practice
widely
was
in
this
case
and
it
does
not
result
in
stabilizing
prices,
i
take
it
you
wouldn't
complain
of
that?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
in
--
in
an
industry
like
this
one,
where
as
you
stated
at
the
outset,
the
price
is
stabilized
because
of
the
nature
of
the
commodity
and
the
--
and
the
nature
of
the
industry.
how
does
this
work
out
in
practice?
if
you
were
a
businessman,
what
would
you
do?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
oh
i
beg
your
pardon,
to
your
question
as
well
there's
a
kind
of
law.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
delone.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
may
i
--
may
i
ask
to
inquire
about
the
procedure
in
the
trial
court.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
as
i
understand,
as
i
get
--
get
from
the
briefs,
the
trial
judge
spoke
more
or
less
extemporaneously
without
a
written
set
of
instruction.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
it
went
on
apparently
for
several
hours
as
far
as
i
can
tell
(voice
overlap)
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
at
the
end
of
the
period,
he
asked
for
objections
to
what
you'd
all
heard.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
in
that
period,
did
you
call
his
attention
to
the
error
in
the
abandonment
instruction?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
(voice
overlap)
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
thank
you.
