justice
potter
stewart
and
you
think
that's
to
be
understood
as
the
instruction
of
the
jury,
“even
if
the
sole
purpose
of
the
verification
was
to
establish
in
this
defense
under
robinson-patman
act,
if
indeed
the
effect
of
it
was,”
then
there
was
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
although,
he
left
that
--
he
left
that
out
of
that
sentence
that
you
read.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
luckily,
we're
only
going
to
be
here
for
an
hour.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
wasn't
there
was
an
also
--
wasn't
there
the
same
--
assertively
the
same
controlling
circumstances
--
circumstance
as
in
cement,
i.e.to
protect
against
customer
fraud?
justice
potter
stewart
here
was
the
assertion
is
that
it
was
to
protect
against
being
misinformed
by
a
customer
that
a
--
that
a
competitor
had
given
him
a
lower
price.
justice
potter
stewart
what
--
what
was
the
customer
fraud
in
cement?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
during
that
protection
period,
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
they
had
over
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they
have
the
fact
doctrine
then.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
unusual
experience
for
any
member
of
this
court
to
casually
use
a
phrase
in
an
opinion
and
then
it
comes
back
a
year
or
two
later
as
a
doctrine.
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
--
mr.
friedman
and
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understood
your
answer
to
my
brother
powell's
question.
what
if
the
avowed
and
acknowledged
proven
purpose
of
the
exchange
of
information
was
to
stabilize
prices,
but
that
that
the
effort
was
unsuccessful
and
the
effect
was
not
and
prices
were
not
stabilized,
would
that
--
not
--
not
be
a
conspiracy
(voice
overlap)?
justice
potter
stewart
even
though
wholly
unsuccessful?
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
still
be
a
violation,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well
then
i
misunderstood
your
answer
to
my
brother
powell's
question.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
instruction
that
which
my
brother
rehnquist
has
just
referred
to,
told
the
jury
that
they
could
infer
a
purpose
from
the
exchange
and
from
the
effect
of
the
exchange
if
the
effect
was
to
stabilize
prices,
then
they
could
infer
a
purpose.
that's
in
short
what
this
instruction
says,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
must
find
purpose
and
they
may
infer
it
from
the
certain
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
insist
that
the
jury
must
be
instructed
that
they
must
find
a
purpose
to
stabilize
prices.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
further
insist
that
there
was
no
such
instruction
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
they
--
and
then
they
make
the
point
that
the
--
that
counsel
were
allowed
to
argue
this
to
the
jury.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there's
nothing
--
can
a
trial
judge
instruct
the
whole
jury
that
the
--
not
on
a
--
but
the
law
preferred
a
verdict
to
a
hung
jury.
that's
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
bartlit,
you
mentioned
right
at
the
clause
of
your
remarks
that
the
names
of
mr.
colon
brown
and
mr.
j.p.
nicely
on
whose
behalf
a
separate
brief
has
been
field
here
and
who
make
quite
a
separate
kind
of
an
argument
including
among
other
things,
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
their
claim
basically
is
to
understand
that
that
there
--
simply
there
was
insufficient
evidence
to
sustain
a
verdict
of
guilty
as
against
them
and
that
they
are
constitutionally
entitled,
if
they're
correct,
not
to
be
tried
again
among
other
things.
justice
potter
stewart
nobody
has
early
represented
them
here?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
represent
mr.
brown
and
mr.
nicely?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
is
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
have
a
community
of
interest.
justice
potter
stewart
but
they
also
have
seemed
to
make
--
be
making
a
separate
argument.
but
your
understanding
is
that's
not
within
the
grant
of
certiorari.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
in
any
event,
of
all
these
practices,
maybe
very
dubious
and
front
with
all
sorts
of
risks.
in
any
event,
it
was
agreed
to
by
counsel
of
the
defense
in
this
case.
