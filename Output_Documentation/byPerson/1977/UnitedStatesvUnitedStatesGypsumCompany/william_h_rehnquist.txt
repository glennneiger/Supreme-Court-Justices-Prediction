justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
the
principle
question
presented,
you
mean
the
questions
presented
by
the
petition
for
certiorari?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say,
“the
main
focus
in
this
court,”
don't
you
have
a
feeling
that
this
had
been
a
dire
act
case
the
third
circuit
would
have
affirmed
on
the
basis
of
harmless
error
with
an
instruction
like
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
friedman,
what
--
what
part
of
the
instruction
is
this
part
of
your
argument
devoted
to?
because
the
--
or
is
it
devoted
to
something
other
than
the
instruction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
hold.
there
wasn't
substantial
evidence
to
support
the
verdict,
did
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
this
--
are
those
the
same
instructions
on
page
13
(a)
of
the
petition?
if
you
decide
the
effect
of
these
exchanges
was
to
raise,
fix,
maintain,
and
stabilize
the
prices,
then
you
may
consider
these
exchanges
as
evidence?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
you're
picking
out
a
part
of
the
instructions
that
the
third
circuit
didn't
really
deal
with
that's
less
favorable
to
the
government
and
saying
--
or
that's
more
than
the
instructions,
more
favorable
to
the
government
and
arguing
that
that
should
be
sustained
here.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
it
surprise
you
that
the
jurors
were
taking
pills
after
delivering
for
four
days
under
(voice
overlap)?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
they
can't
even
use
it
as
you
know
basis
for
inference.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
not
the
one
that
judge
hunter
relied
on.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
you
look
at
the
third
paragraph
of
the
instruction
of
the
petitioner
on
page
13
(a),
which
is
a
part
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
beginning,
“however,
if
you
decide
that
the
effect
to
the
exchanges
was
to
raise,
fix,
maintain,
and
stabilize
the
price
of
gypsum
wallboard,
then
you
may
consider
these
exchanges
as
evidence
of
the
mutual
agreement
or
understanding
alleged
in
the
indictment
to
raise,
fix,
maintain,
and
stabilize
list
prices.”
do
you
think
that's
an
erroneous
statement
of
the
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
judge
hunter
said
they
couldn't.
he
said
that
was
an
erroneous
statement,
didn't
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
assuming
you're
turning
it
for
the
government
or
for
the
defendant?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you're
--
you're
saying
that
a
charge
for
the
judges
you
may
infer
and
you're
saying
the
charge
should
be
you
must
infer.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
friedman,
i
noticed
the
government
doesn't
urge
what
--
i
kept
thought
it
usual
to
urge
in
criminal
cases
that
the
instruction
should
be
considered
as
a
whole
and
no
one
singled
out.
does
that
mean
that
you
want
to
win
only
by
an
essay
on
antitrust
law
from
this
court?
