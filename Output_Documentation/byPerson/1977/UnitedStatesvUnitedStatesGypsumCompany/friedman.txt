mr.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
principle
question
in
this
criminal
antitrust
case,
which
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
from
the
third
circuit,
is
whether
sellers
who
concertedly
exchange
among
themselves
information
with
respect
to
the
current
prices
which
they
are
selling
and
other
competitive
matters
conduct
that
would
otherwise
violate
section
i
of
the
sherman
act
may
justify
this
conduct
on
the
ground
that
the
information
they
are
seeking
from
their
competitors
would
be
helpful
to
them
in
establishing
a
meeting
competition
defense
under
section
2
(b)
of
the
robinson-patman
act
has
a
defense
to
a
charge
that
might
be
brought
against
them
of
price
discrimination.
mr.
friedman
by
--
by
our
petition,
yes.
mr.
friedman
that's
the
main
issue,
that's
the
main
focus
in
this
court
and
the
reason
perhaps
--
mr.
friedman
i
--
i
would
--
i
don't
know,
mr.
justice,
but
let
me
explain
the
reason
i
say
it's
the
principle
case.
in
addition
to
this
issue,
a
single
judge
on
the
court
of
appeals,
two
of
them,
each
individually
found
three
other
grounds
for
reversing
this
conviction
in
the
instructions.
one
of
the
judges
thought
that
the
instructions
were
defective
in
two
respects
because
they
failed
to
specify
what
was
necessary
to
be
shown
in
order
to
establish
the
participation
of
particular
defendants
in
the
conspiracy
and
also
that
the
instructions
were
deficient
on
withdrawal
from
the
conspiracy.
another
judge,
although
not
agreeing
with
those
two
rulings,
sought
that
the
jury
had
coerced
a
verdict.
so
that
what
you
have
in
this
case
is
the
robinson-patman
act
issue
concurred
in
by
two
judges
of
the
court
of
appeals,
other
criminal
law
rulings
concurred
in
by
only
one
judge
of
the
court
but
the
two
single
judges
together
ended
up
with
a
majority
that
would
have
resulted
in
reversal
apart
from
the
robinson-patman
act
question.
the
indictment
in
this
case,
which
was
returned
in
december
1937,
charged
six
corporations
that
manufactured
gypsum
board
and
ten
of
their
individual
officers
with
having
conspired
from
before
1960
until
the
return
of
the
indictment
in
violation
of
section
i
of
the
sherman
act
to
fix,
raise,
maintain,
and
stabilize
prices
of
gypsum
board
to
fix,
maintain,
and
stabilize
the
terms
and
conditions
of
sale
and
to
adopt
uniform
methods
of
handling
and
packaging,
two
of
the
corporations
and
seven
of
the
individual
pleaded
nolo
contendere.
after
a
19-week
trial,
the
jury
convicted
the
four
remaining
corporations
and
the
three
individual
offices
of
those
corporations
who
are
the
respondents
before
this
court.
i'd
just
like
to
say
a
word
about
the
gypsum
board
industry
itself
because
the
character
of
the
industry
is
significant
with
respect
to
the
issues
involved
in
this
case.
a
gypsum
board
has
largely
replaced
plaster
as
the
major
material
used
for
the
interior
walls
of
buildings.
now,
the
gypsum
board,
the
standard
board
produced
by
all
manufacturers
is
the
same.
you
can't
tell
it
one
from
the
other.
and
as
a
result
of
this,
the
competition
among
manufacturers
of
gypsum
board
is
not
stressed
quality,
but
rather
price,
discounts,
and
service.
the
product
is
a
heavy
product,
which
means
that
shipping
costs
are
extensive
and
it's
difficult
to
serve
a
very
large
area
from
a
particular
plant.
the
respondents
have
plants
throughout
the
county.
the
industry
is
also
highly
concentrated.
during
the
period
covered
by
this
indictment,
the
four
corporate
respondents
had
75%
of
national
sales.
they've
been
the
four
largest
in
the
industry.
the
eight
largest
in
the
industry
had
a
total
of
94%
of
the
--
of
the
industry.
the
remaining
6%
of
the
industry
was
held
by
seven
firms
of
the
so-called
“single-plant
producers.”
a
firm
that
had
only
one
plant
and
of
necessity
would
serve
a
much
smaller
geographical
area
than
the
nation
companies
could
serve.
these
companies
came
into
existence
in
the
1950s
and
1960s
and
one
of
the
charges
in
our
complaint,
which
we
believe
the
records
supports,
is
that
part
of
the
defendants'
conspiracy
involved
predatory
practices
directed
against
the
single
producers.
the
indictment
charged
that
the
defendants
had
utilized
a
number
of
different
means
for
effectuating
the
conspiracy
and
the
one
that
was
most
litigated
in
this
case
was
a
practice
that
the
defendants
referred
to
as
verification.
under
this
practice,
when
an
official
at
the
headquarters
of
one
of
the
companies
was
informed
from
the
field
that
a
customer
had
been
“a
lower
price
by
a
competitor,”
he
verified
with
the
company
that
was
reported
as
giving
this
price.
if
the
other
company
denied
giving
the
price,
then
they
normally
would
not
need
it.
if,
however,
the
other
company
acknowledged
giving
the
price,
then
the
usual,
but
not
the
invariable
practice,
was
for
the
first
company
to
meet
that
price.
the
product
was
sold
at
a
list
price
with
a
discount.
the
list
prices
throughout
the
period
were
virtually
identical
by
all
the
manufactures
and
the
--
discussion
of
verification
related
primarily
to
the
discounts
that
would
be
given
off
these
prices.
mr.
friedman
just
--
if
that
--
if
that's
all
you
had
--
well,
we
would
say
that
the
verification
alone,
verification
alone
in
the
circumstances
of
this
--
well,
if
that's
all
they
did,
if
all
they
were
doing
was
verifying,
if
that's
all
that
were
shown
that
would
not,
in
our
view,
be
a
violation
of
section
--
mr.
friedman
and
then
that
would
--
mr.
friedman
--
meeting
--
meeting
would
be
--
that
would
begin
to
get
more.
mr.
friedman
i
--
i
couldn't
state
without
knowing
more
fact,
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
but,
and
this
we
think
is
the
critical
thing
in
this
case,
the
charge
was
and
the
jury
by
its
verdict
must
have
found
that
verification
if
done
with
either
the
purpose
or
the
effect
of
fixing
prices
would
be
enough
to
violate
the
sherman
act.
that
--
that's
--
our
case
is
not
limited
just
to
the
mere
act
of
the
verification
because
there's
a
lot
more.
let
me
add
two
things
and
addition
to
the
verification.
it
was
not
only
with
respect
to
prices.
it
was
also
with
respect
to
various
terms
and
conditions
of
sale.
for
example,
i
would
call
to
ask
whether
somebody
was
giving
greater
credit
terms
than
they
were
giving.
in
some
instances,
they
call
to
ask
whether
firms
with
trucking
the
product
to
the
customer
because
trucking
is
more
convenient
if
it's
delivered
right
to
your
plant
than
if
you
have
to
pick
it
up
at
the
rail
site.
and
there
are
instances
in
which
the
inquiry
related,
not
just
to
what
was
being
done
with
respect
to
a
specific
customer
but
more
broadly.
what
were
you
doing
in
a
particular
city?
is
it
true
you're
doing
certain
things
in
texas
and
so
on?
the
primary
justification
that
the
respondents
offered
for
this
practice
was
that
they
say
the
need
to
comply
with
the
robinson-patman
act.
now,
the
robinson-patman
act,
of
course,
prohibits
generally
discriminations
in
price
whose
effect
may
be
substantially
to
lessen
competition.
it
provides
a
limited
exception
in
2
(b)
which
says
that,
“a
person
charged
with
discrimination
may
justify
it
by
showing
that
he
gave
the
lower
discriminatory
price
and
a
good
faith
attempt
to
meet
the
equally
low
price
of
a
competitor.”
the
respondents
also
contended
that
they
needed
to
engage
in
this
practice
in
order
to
protect
themselves
against
what
they
called
“customer
fraud.”
the
customer
fraud
as
they
see
it
being
that
a
customer
misrepresented
to
them
that
the
custom
was
getting
a
lower
offer
from
one
of
the
competitors.
but
at
the
trial,
there
were
a
number
of
admissions
that
at
least
one
purpose
of
this
verification
was
to
minimize
price
competition.
as
one
officer
of
united
states
gypsum
stated,
he
said,
“i
was
attempting
to
minimize
deviations
from
list
price.”
that's
at
page
501
of
the
record.
it's
described
as
another
method
of
keeping
prices
up,
at
page
519,
to
keep
market
stability,
to
guard
against
price
erosion.”
one
of
these
single-plant
producers
joined
in
this
conspiracy.
he
did
so
after
he
had
attended
the
first
meeting
of
the
gypsum
association,
the
trade
association
at
which
mr.
respondent
watt,
the
executive
vice
president
of
u.s.
gypsum
company,
said
there
were
certain
things
that
went
on
in
the
gypsum
industry.
specifically,
he
talked
about
the
exchange
of
price
information
and
the
need
to
be
honest.
and
this
man
stated
that
after
he
had
been
told
that,
the
reason
he
engaged
in
verification
was,
and
this
is
at
205
of
the
record,
the
price
in
our
prime
market
was
rapidly
deteriorating
and
my
motive
was
to
try
to
keep
it
from
deteriorating
any
further.
now,
during
the
time
of
this
conspiracy
--
mr.
friedman
no,
it's
--
it's
devoted
to
the
--
the
basic
question
of
whether
a
--
an
agreement
of
price
exchange
agreement
that
has
the
effect
of
fixing
or
stabilizing
prices
may
be
justified
because
of
a
purpose
to
comply
with
the
robinson-patman
act.
and
our
argument
on
that
score
primarily
is
that
because
this
exchange
of
prices
tends
to
facilitate
price
maintenance,
price
stabilization,
and
price
fixing
to
permit
this
would
create
a
serious
loophole
in
the
sherman
act,
and
this
is
designed
to
show
that
the
defendants
themselves
at
least
recognize
and
to
show
what
the
--
one
of
the
purposes
was.
mr.
friedman
no.
it's
--
it's
unclear
exactly
what
the
court
of
appeals
held.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
there
was
evidence
to
support
a
finding
that
this
was
their
purpose
and
it's
rather
cryptic
whether
they
also
held
that
that
was
the
effect.
but
presumably,
since
it
remanded
for
a
new
trail
under
the
different
instruction,
the
court
of
appeals
thought
necessary,
they
must
have
believed
that
on
the
proper
instruction
a
finding
of
effect
would
be
sustainable.
mr.
friedman
from
the
beginning
--
prior
to
1960
until
the
return
of
the
indictment
in
december
1973.
mr.
friedman
yes.
that's
a
five-year
statute
so
the
cutoff
date
is,
i
think,
it's
december
27th
or
something
like
that.
mr.
friedman
68.
mr.
friedman
most
--
most
of
them
did,
mr.
justice.
but
we've
also
explained
in
our
brief
that
there
was
evidence
that
the
conduct
continued
into
the
limitations
period.
and
of
course,
if
the
conspiracy
was
underway
before
the
limitations
period,
as
long
as
acts
were
done
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy
during
the
limitations
period
that
is
enough
to
establish
a
violation.
but
there
--
there
was
some
continuing
activities,
some
verification,
various
other
things,
some
price
maintenance
during
the
period
of
the
--
mr.
friedman
that
--
that
is
--
that
is
undoubtedly
correct.
but
i
--
i
think
one
thing,
i
may
be
just
mention,
in
connection
with
the
verification
practices
rather
interesting,
the
major
reason
that
was
suggested,
they
needed
to
engage
in
verification
was
so
they
can
protect
themselves
for
a
meeting
competition
defense
if
they
were
charged
with
price
discrimination,
but
they
kept
no
records
at
all
of
these
communications.
they
kept
no
records.
indeed,
there
were
policies
not
to
keep
records
and
when
one
man
was
asked,
“well,
if
you
needed
this
for
--
in
order
to
protect
yourself
to
establish
a
robinson-patman
meeting-competition
defense,
why
didn't
you
keep
any
records?”
he
said,
“well,
i
can't
really
answer
to
that.
it
just
didn't
seem
necessary.”
so,
i
think
that,
again,
is
illustrative
of
the
dangers
in
this
kind
of
thing.
now,
during
the
period
in
november
and
december
1965,
following
the
lead
of
u.s.
gypsum,
all
of
the
respondents
announced
that
they
were
giving
up
discounting.
they
were
all
going
to
sell
at
less
prices,
identical
less
prices.
and
for
a
year
and
a
half
to
two
years,
this
happened.
and
despite
the
fact
that
they
were
not
giving
any
discounts
at
this
period,
they
still
continued
to
verify.
and
the
lack
of
discounting
and
the
increased
prices
took
place
at
a
time
when
there
was
a
decreased
in
demand
for
the
product
and
over
capacity.
the
court
gave
a
lengthy
charge
to
the
jury
and
explained
at
length
the
robinson-patman
act
and
what
the
meeting
competition
defense
involved.
and
what
the
court
told
the
jury
was
that
they
could
convict
the
defendants
if
they
found
either
a
purpose
to
fix
and
stabilize
prices
or
that
the
effect
of
what
the
defendants
had
done
was
to
fix
those
stabilized
prices.
and
it
said,
“if
the
effect
of
such
exchanges
was
to
fix
--
raise,
fix,
maintain
or
stabilize
prices,
then
an
agreement
to
engage
in
such
in
exchange
is
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act,
regardless
of
the
specific
purpose
that
the
parties
to
the
agreement
had
in
mind.”
it
was
that
instruction
that
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
held
was
erroneous.
mr.
friedman
well,
no.
it
went
--
it
went
beyond
that.
that
was
the
first
part
of
the
instruction,
mr.
justice.
but
over
pages
17
--
page
1722
of
the
record,
after
they
gave
that
instruction,
the
court
charged,
“if
the
effect
of
such
exchanges,”
and
this
is
about
five
lines
down,
“was
to
raise,
fix,
maintain,
or
stabilize
prices,
then
an
agreement
to
engage
in
such
an
exchange
is
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act,
regardless
of
the
specific
purpose
that
the
parties
to
the
agreement
had
in
their
minds.”
therefore,
and
then
goes
on
in
the
next
paragraph,
“the
effect
was
to
stay
within
the
parties
are
presumed
as
a
matter
of
law
who've
intended
that
results.”
so
the
court
charged
the
jury
that
they
could
convict
if
they
found
that
the
effect
of
this
--
at
first,
that
they
had
to
find
there
was
an
agreement,
and
if
they
found
that
was
an
agreement,
if
they
found
that
the
effect
of
this
agreement
was
to
raise,
maintain,
or
stabilize
prices
that
was
enough
to
establish
a
violation
of
section
i
of
the
sherman
act.
mr.
friedman
well,
no.
i
--
i
think
the
court
--
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
had
fairly
read
its
opinion,
said
it
varied
in
different
places.
what
it
fairly
said
was
that
was
that
if
the
sole
purpose
of
this
verification
was
to
protect,
to
serve
their
defense
under
the
robinson-patman
act,
then
that
would
not
be
a
basis
for
finding
a
violation
of
section
i.
i
think
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
and
the
dissenting
opinion
by
judge
weis
in
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
the
instruction
properly
stated
the
law.
mr.
friedman
no.
mr.
justice,
he
said,
“if
the
sole
purpose
was
good
faith
compliance,
there
was
no
violation
unless,
unless
it
had
the
effect
of
fixing,
maintaining,
or
stabilizing
prices.”
i
think,
i
believe
that's
--
that
--
the
instruction
is
somewhat
cryptic,
but
i
think
when
you
read
it
all
together,
you'll
see
what
he
was
telling
was,
“if
you
find
they
had
the
purpose
of
fixing,
stabilizing
prices,
then
that's
bad.
if
you
find,
they
had
no
purpose,
but
no
adverse
effect,
then
it
would
be
all
right.
but
if
you
found
that
it
had
an
adverse
effect
without
regard
to
the
purpose
that
was
enough
to
--“
mr.
friedman
well,
no.
but
he
said,
“you
wouldn't,
couldn't
consider
a
verification
standing
alone
--“
mr.
friedman
“--as
establishing
an
agreement.”
but
we
had
more
than
just
verification
in
this
case.
but
then
he
went
on
to
say,
“if
you
decide
that
the
effect
of
these
exchanges,
was
in
the
next
sentence,
to
fix,
maintain,
and
stabilize
prices,
then
you
may
consider
these
changes
as
evidence
of
the
mutual
agreement
or
understanding
alleged
in
the
indictment
to
fix,
maintain,
and
stabilize
less
price.”
so,
i
think
what
he
was
--
mr.
friedman
that's
--
that's
correct.
then
i
think
that's
--
and
i
think
--
mr.
friedman
well,
it's
not
--
mr.
friedman
no,
like
the
jury
could
infer
of
what
--
could
find
a
violation
if
--
mr.
friedman
yes,
it
doesn't
surprise
me.
mr.
justice,
i
was
ready
to
take
pills
when
i
was
plowing
through
this
record.
no,
i
didn't
have
any
to
take.
mr.
friedman
well,
i
think
--
i
think
--
mr.
friedman
i
think
so.
what
he
said
was
there
was
one
woman
who
was
at
the
window
and
he
thought
maybe
she
was
going
to
jump
out,
but
i
--
i
don't
think
he
said
that.
it
is
clear
that
some
of
the
--
mr.
friedman
well,
that's
not
--
that's
not
unusual,
mr.
justice,
with
a
long
case
and
a
complicated,
difficult
case.
mr.
friedman
lot
of
facts,
seven
defendants,
you
have
to
evaluate
the
evidence
against
each
of
them.
it
is
something
that
would
try
the
temper
of
i
think
all
people.
so,
now,
let
me
comment
to
the
--
the
gut
issue
in
the
case
which
is
whether
you
can
justify
an
agreement
exchanging
prices
that
would
otherwise
violate
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
because
you
say
you
need
and
want
this
information
in
order
to
establish
a
meeting
competition
defense
under
the
robinson-patman
act.
price,
exchanges
of
price
information
occupy
a
peculiar
place
in
the
learning
of
this
court.
there
have
been
cases
which
have
upheld
them,
there
have
been
cases
which
have
turned
them
down
and
said
that
the
exchange
of
price
information
was
not
permissible.
but
i
think
the
one
thread
that
runs
through
all
of
these
cases
and
culminates
in
this
court's
decision
nine
years
ago
in
the
container
case
was
that
an
exchange
of
current
prices,
which
is
what
this
was,
how
much
they
were
offering
to
a
particular
customer,
than
an
exchange
of
current
prices
violates
the
sherman
act
if
either
its
purpose
or
its
effect
was
to
fix
a
stabilized
or
maintain
the
pricing.
mr.
friedman
i
do
--
i
do,
mr.
justice,
because
the
dissenting
opinion
in
container
specifically
refers
two
or
three
times,
it
said
they
did
not
think
in
this
case
--
in
that
case,
the
government
had
established
either
the
purpose
or
the
intent
to
stabilize
fixed
prices.
i
think
they
--
mr.
friedman
or
effects.
i'm
sorry,
either
the
purpose
or
effect.
i
think
the
disagreement
between
the
majority
and
the
minority
over
what
the
government
had
proved
in
the
case,
not
over
the
guiding
legal
standard.
and
i
think
this
principle
reflects
the
economic
realities
of
what
happens
when
you
have
this
kind
of
an
exchange
of
price
information.
there
is
very
little
incentive
for
one
firm
to
cut
its
prices
if
it
knows
that
as
soon
as
it
does
so,
its
opponent,
its
competitors
will
know
about
it
because
as
soon
it
is
reported
by
a
customer
that
the
price
has
been
cut,
the
salesman,
wanting
to
make
a
sale,
will
try
to
get
approval
from
the
home
office
to
make
the
cut.
he
will
have
to
say
who
the
competitor
was
that
gave
the
price.
the
firm,
getting
this
request,
will
make
--
get
in
touch
with
the
other
firm
to
see
whether
they
did
it.
well,
this
it
seems
to
me
--
and
correspondingly,
you
know
that
if
you
are
giving
them
price
information,
they
are
giving
you
price
information.
it
seems
to
me
this
removes
a
great
deal
of
the
incentive
for
engaging
in
price
competition
because
price
competition
is
effective,
it
is
effective
when
what
you
have
is
a
first
price
and
it's
tried
to
be
done
secretly.
if
--
if
your
course
remained
relatively
steady,
the
only
reason
to
cut
a
price
is
in
the
hope
of
gaining
greater
volume.
you
make
up
in
your
volume
what
you
lose
in
the
individual
sale,
but
if
you
know
that
everyone
is
going
to
follow
suit,
it
is
no
great
incentive
to
do
this.
and
similarly,
this
kind
of
verification
of
prices
is
a
very
effective
method
of
policing,
of
policing
an
agreement
to
fix
prices
because
you
know
that
if
you
deviate
from
the
agreement
you
will
be
caught
up
on
it
very
quickly
and
the
record
shows
numerous
instances
where
that
kind
of
thing
happened.
now,
the
container
case,
we
think
is
very
close
to
this
case.
there
you
had
a
similar
situation
that
the
companies
reciprocally
exchanged
their
most
recent
prices
on
sales
to
specific
customers
without
even
considering
the
purpose
of
this
arrangement.
the
court
held
the
price
--
this
arrangement
was
illegal
price-fixing
because
it
said
it
stabilized
prices
though
at
a
downward
level.
the
inferences
are
irresistible
that
the
exchange
of
price-information
has
had
an
anticompetitive
effect
in
the
industry,
chilling
the
vigor
of
price
competition.
the
court
of
appeals
decision
and
respondent's
argument
in
this
case
as
to
why
they
should
have
this
exception
rest
on
two
words,
literally
two
words
in
the
container
opinion.
the
opinion
in
container
began
to
--
by
explaining
why
this
case
is
unlike
any
other
price
decisions
we
have
rendered.
and
then
it
distinguished
container
from
other
cases,
and
it
distinguished
among
other
cases
the
cement
manufacturers
case
which
had
upheld
an
exchange
of
price
information.
and
it's
noted
that
while
both
cases
involved
an
exchange
of
prices
to
specific
customers,
there
was
absent
to
controlling
circumstances,
this,
the
cement
manufacturers
price
exchanges
were
designed
to
protect
against
fraud.
and
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
respondents
urged
that
because
this
court,
in
distinguishing
the
case
used
the
word
“controlling
circumstance,”
this
amounts
to
a
recognition
of
an
exception
to
the
general
rule
condemning
the
exchange
of
price
information
that
has
an
adverse
effect
on
competition
if
there
is
a
controlling
circumstance
that
will
justify
an
exception.
and
then
they
go
and
say,
“in
here,
we
had
a
different
--
another
controlling
circumstances,
that
which
to
protect
themselves
from
being
charged
with
price
discrimination
under
the
robinson-patman
act.”
mr.
friedman
well,
that,
we
think
is
a
different
type
of
customer
fraud,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
friedman
yes,
yes.
mr.
friedman
in
cement,
the
customer
fraud
was
they
had
an
arrangement
whereby
they
would
permit
people
to
get
a
product
at
a
lower
price
during
the
duration
where
they
were
going
to
increase
the
price
--
mr.
friedman
protection.
mr.
friedman
and
--
and
the
purpose
of
the
exchange
in
cement
was
to
enable
a
firm
to
be
protected
against
having
to
ship.
it
was
the
concern.
it
was
the
shipment,
whereas
here
the
concern
was
to
find
out
whether
a
similar
arrangement
was
being
offered
by
a
competitor.
now,
we
--
we
don't
think
that
that
statement
in
container
can
fairly
be
read
as
creating
this
kind
of
an
exemption.
it
just
--
it
was
the
words
that
the
court
happened
to
use.
the
court
could
have
equally
said,
instead
of
saying
that
that
case,
there
was
absence
instead
the
controlling
circumstance,
there
was,
“absent
the
fact
that.”
if
the
court
had
said
that,
which
would
have
been
the
identical
statement,
there
wouldn't
be
any
basis
for
this
--
mr.
friedman
what?
mr.
friedman
that's
right.
we
don't
--
we
don't
--
we
don't
think
--
mr.
friedman
test.
we
don't
think
that
that's
fairly
what
container
said.
i
think
you've
got
to
look
and
see
what
container
held.
what
container
held
was
that
the
exchange
of
price
information
there,
similar
to
that
that
you
have
here,
was
an
illegal
price
tampering
of
price
fix
and
price
stabilization
under
the
sherman
act
because
of
its
effect
upon
prices,
because
of
its
effect
in
prices.
there
is
nothing
in
the
robinson-patman
act
that
says
that
in
order
to
establish
your
good
faith
in
giving
a
discriminatory
lower
price
to
show
that
it
was
done
in
good
faith
to
meet
the
equally
low
price
of
a
competitor,
you've
got
to
check
with
the
competitor
to
find
out
how
much
he
is
charging.
the
federal
trade
commission
does
not
take
that
position
and
they
--
it
is
attached
to
our
petition,
the
letter
they
sent
us
advising
that
and
we
know
of
no
court
cases
that
take
that
position.
they
ruled
that
the
court
of
appeals
--
the
principle
the
court
of
appeals
has
announced
and
the
principle
for
which
the
respondents
are
arguing
here,
it
seems
to
us,
would
cut
a
very
wide
gap
in
the
sherman
act
because
it's
not
difficult
for
people
who
want
to
facilitate
the
maintenance
of
prices
to
say
they
have
to
do
it
in
order
to
protect
themselves
against
--
protect
themselves
from
a
possible
charge
under
the
robinson-patman
act
because
the
robinson-patman
act,
they
talk
about
meeting
the
requirements
of
2
(b)
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
the
robinson-patman
act,
the
only
requirements
of
the
robinson-patman
act
are
that
you
cannot
discriminate
in
price
where
it
has
anticompetitive
effects.
2
(b)
is
a
limited
exception
to
that
defense.
it
is
a
defense
recognizing
a
specific
situation,
but
it
has
never
been
thought,
it
seems
me,
that
in
order
to
take
advantage
of
a
defense
like
that,
you
can
justify
something
that
otherwise
would
violate
another
statute
and
that
is
precisely
what
happens
in
this
case
because
the
claim
is
that
even
though
this
thing
has
the
prohibited
effect
upon
competition,
even
though
this
exchanged,
has
had
the
effect
of
stabilizing
or
fixing
prices.
nevertheless,
they
can
justify
it
because
they
want
this
information
in
order
to
defend
against
a
possible
charge
of
price
discrimination.
now,
the
argument
has
been
made
here
that
to
subject
the
respondents
to
conviction
for
this
conduct
amounts
to
a
prohibited
retroactive
application
of
a
new
rule
of
law,
we
don't
think
there
was
any
new
rule
of
law
that
was
applied
by
the
district
of
court
in
this
case,
we
think.
so
i've
indicated
that
principles
governing
this
field
are
well
settled
and
all
the
district
court
did
was
to
tell
the
jury
to
apply
these
principles
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
so
on
this
aspect
of
the
case,
we
think
that
--
mr.
friedman
yes,
yes,
we
would
say
that
instruction,
that's
what
we're
challenging
that
instruction.
that
instruction
would
have
been
wrong,
we
think,
because
we
don't
think
that
if
they
engage
in
the
practice
solely
to
comply
with
the
strictures
of
the
robinson-patman
act,
even
subject
to
the
other
qualification
that
that
would
be
a
justification.
our
position
is
that
you
cannot
justify
an
exchange
of
price
information
that
has
the
effect
of
fixing
prices
because
of
if
you
wish
to
even
solely
to
comply
with
the
robinson-patman
act.
we
would
not
accept
that
(inaudible)
in
fact,
that's
what
the
holding,
i
suppose,
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
and
that's
the
holding
we're
challenge.
that
--
that
gives
a
--
that
holding
is
a
narrow
rule
from
the
respondents
there,
but
even
that
rule,
in
our
opinion,
is
wrong.
now
--
mr.
friedman
no.
if
--
if
in
other
words,
if
i
may
rephrase
your
question,
mr.
justice,
if
we
assume
that
the
stable
--
the
exchange
of
prices
did
not
adversely
affect
competition
price
to
price
level.
if
there
were
mere
exchange
of
prices,
we
would
not
question
that.
and
indeed,
this
court,
in
many
of
its
decisions
has
recognized
that
a
mere
exchange
of
prices
itself
is
not
illegal,
indeed
it
may
be
very
useful
in
some
situations.
mr.
friedman
well,
the
--
it's
stabilized
through
list
prices,
but
what
that
trying
to
do
is
prevent
and
eliminate
the
discounting.
that's
--
that's
the
problem,
it
seems
to
me.
i
think
if
--
if
i
am
selling
it
list
price
and
the
customer
comes
to
me
and
says,
“a
competitor
is
offering
me
a
lower
price,”
i
have
to
decide
whether
i
want
to
cut
the
price
on
that
sale
or
not.
i
can't
check
with
my
competitors.
i
can
make
the
best
judgment,
the
best
judgment
i
can
make
on
the
basis,
everything
i
know.
for
example,
is
this
customer
reliable?
how
reliable
is
the
salesman?
is
this
the
first
--?
mr.
friedman
what?
mr.
friedman
competitor.
mr.
friedman
no.
i
think
--
i
don't
think
the
sherman
act
permits
that
kind
of
direct
consultation
between
competitors
over
the
price
they
are
going
to
charge
where
it's
a
widespread
practice
and
where
it
has
the
effect
that
the
jury
must
have
found
in
this
case.
mr.
friedman
that
--
that
would
be
a
violation
if
there
was
an
agreement
and
if
the
purpose
was
to
stabilize
prices.
mr.
friedman
even
though
wholly
unsuccessful.
mr.
friedman
it
would
still
be
a
violation.
mr.
friedman
sorry,
i
--
mr.
friedman
well,
it
is.
it
is
one
element,
it
is
one
element.
mr.
friedman
oh
yes,
yes.
mr.
friedman
yes,
yes.
mr.
friedman
yes,
yes.
mr.
friedman
there
has
to
be
--
there
has
to
be
two
things.
there
has
to
be
the
conspiracy
and
there
also
has
to
be
the
purpose
of
the
conspiracy.
the
purpose
of
the
conspiracy
has
to
be
to
fix,
stabilize,
or
maintain
prices.
there
has
to
be
a
conspiracy
to
fix
prices
in
other
words,
but
you
can
presume
--
mr.
friedman
i
--
i
would
think
--
think
if
--
mr.
friedman
no.
i
would
think
that
is
for
the
jury
to
decide,
but
i
would
think
it's
certainly
a
problem.
mr.
friedman
yes,
there
is
more
to
it,
but
the
reason
i
am
putting
it
in
these
terms
is
because
of
the
--
what
we
think
is
the
error
of
the
court
of
appeals
holding
that
without
regard
to
the
effect
on
prices
or
what
the
agreement
was,
if
the
purpose
was
merely
to
offer
a
defense
under
the
robinson-patman
act,
then
that
would
be
sufficient
to
justify
the
practice.
i
would
like
mr.
chief
justice,
we've
dealt
with
the
jury
instructions
in
our
brief,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
the
final
words
that
the
judge
gave
to
the
juror
at
this
meeting
he
had
with
him
at
page
80
and
140
is
you
tell
them
to
keep
deliberating
and
see
if
they
can
come
to
a
verdict.
that's
the
last
thing
he
told
them.
mr.
friedman
well,
we
don't
know
specifically
of
course
what
the
judge
--
mr.
friedman
that's
right.
but
i
think
there
are
two
things
about
this.
first,
three
times
before
this
meeting
with
the
foreman,
the
court
specifically
instructed
the
jury
that
while
he
would
like
him
to
come
to
a
verdict,
then
they
should
reexamine
their
beliefs.
they
should
not
give
up
a
belief
consciously
held
either
because
the
views
of
other
jurors
or
because
of
their
wish
to
reach
a
verdict.
this
in
effect
is
a
modification
of
the
allen
charge
that
the
third
circuit
has
developed.
so,
the
jury
was
told
repeatedly,
they
were
not
to
surrender
their
independent
judgment.
secondly,
after
the
foreman
returned
to
the
jury,
as
far
as
we
can
tell,
the
jury
deliberated
for
about
eight
hours
longer
before
coming
to
a
verdict.
the
juror
--
the
jury
would
turn
to
its
deliberations
at
12:04.
we
assume
they
deliberate
at
that
day
until
6
or
6:30,
they
--
it
only
began
at
8
in
the
morning.
they
brought
in
the
verdict
at
10:45
the
next
day.
so,
we
had
a
substantial
period
of
further
deliberations.
mr.
friedman
that
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
friedman
i
--
i
don't
think
so
--
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
justice,
because
before,
before
it
should
be
held
that
a
jury
has
been
coerced,
it
seems
to
me
we
need
something
more
than
this
dialog
where
the
foreman
had
again
request
to
the
judge
saying
the
verdict
of
the
jury
is
a
hung
jury
and
we
like
--
we
think
we've
had
enough
of
this
and
the
judge
said,
“i
want
you
to
go
back,”
he
said
at
1839,
“i
want
you
to
go
back
and
deliberate
again."
and
--
mr.
friedman
oh
yes.
it
was
specifically
agreed
to
and
the
judge
told
counsel
not
only
that
he
planned
to
do
this
but
that
he
would
not
make
the
transcript
available.
and
he
told
counsel,
“if
any
of
you
have
any
objection
to
this,
if
any
of
you
have
any
objection
to
this,
i
will
tell
the
foreman,
‘no,
i
will
meet
with
him.”
he
then
in
turn
called
the
jury
and
wanted
to
be
sure
that
it
was
the
request
of
the
whole
jury,
not
just
that
of
the
foreman.
mr.
friedman
well,
because
mr.
--
two
reasons,
mr.
justice.
first
of
all,
nobody
knows
what
the
foreman
was
going
to
say
and
it
was
a
request
for
the
jury
that
he
meets
with
the
foreman.
that
was
the
first
thing.
the
second
thing
about
this
whole
procedure
is,
that
if
the
judge
starts
telling
the
jury,
starts
instructing
the
jury
that
they
have
a
right
not
to
return
a
verdict,
that
it
seems
to
me,
it's
not
the
way
it's
done
because
that
encourage
the
jury
in
a
hard
case
to
say,
“well,
we
have
the
option.”
mr.
friedman
no,
all
--
no.
all
he
told
--
all
he
told
the
foreman
was
--
mr.
friedman
well,
he
could
have
done
that
--
mr.
friedman
he
could
have
done
that,
but
i
don't
think
it
was
necessary,
mr.
justice,
in
light
of
the
previous
charges,
in
the
light
of
what
was
said
to
him
by
the
foreman.
the
--
the
purpose
of
this
discussion,
as
he
indicated,
the
foreman
was
trying
to
convince
the
court
that
the
jury
was
hopelessly
deadlocked
and
that
the
jury
should
be
discharge.
and
he
said,
“no,
i
want
you
to
go
back
and
deliberate
some
more.”
he
didn't
tell
them
they
had
to
reach
a
verdict.
mr.
friedman
well,
i
--
mr.
friedman
well,
this
--
mr.
friedman
that
--
that
might
--
that
would
--
would
well
be
a
serious
problem,
mr.
chief
justice.
but,
but
i
respond
to
that
that
there
is
a
strong
policy
against
looking
behind
the
jury
and
see
what
influenced
their
verdict.
now
--
mr.
friedman
well,
but
--
mr.
friedman
that
is
--
that
is
quite
true,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
this
was
consented
to,
not
only
by
the
four
counsel
for
the
corporation's
consent.
each
individual
defendant
was
specifically
asked
if
he
consented
and
they
said,
“yes,
the
court
in
this
colloquy
did
not
instruct
the
jury
either
than
to
tell
the
jury
to
go
back
and
deliberate
some
more.”
that
seems
to
me
to
be
a
fairly
of
reasonable
response
when
the
jury
said,
“i
think
--”
the
foreman
said,
“i
think
the
jury
is
hopelessly
deadlocked.
we
would
like
to
be
discharged.
the
court
said,
“go
back.
deliberate
some
more
and
see
if
you
can
come
to
a
verdict,”
and
they
deliberated
some
more.
they
deliberated
for
eight
hours
--
mr.
friedman
--
and
they
came
--
mr.
friedman
the
option
was
that
either
they
would
consent
or
he
would
tell
the
juror
or
the
foreman,
“no,
i
will
not
meet
with
you.”
that
was
the
chase.
he
said,
“either
you
--
this
is
the
way
i
think
it
should
be
done.
i
don't
want
this
transcript
made
public
because
something
maybe
said
that
would
be
inappropriate
and
either
if
you
don't
consent,
i'm
not
going
to
do
this
unless
everyone
consents.
and
if
you
don't
consent,
i
will
say
no
to
the
jury,"
and
then
i
supposed
they'd
go
on
in
their
deliberations
or
maybe
they
would
send
another
note.
they
say
they
felt
coerced,
but
it
would
seem
to
me
it
was
a
--
a
free
acknowledgement
indeed.
one
of
the
counsels,
mr.
keck,
not
only
consented
but
urged
the
judge
to
meet
with
the
foreman.
mr.
friedman
yes.
mr.
friedman
no,
no.
we
did
--
we
did
--
i
believe
we
did
indicate
in
our
brief,
mr.
justice,
that
of
course
the
instructions
have
to
be
viewed
as
a
whole.
of
course,
they
have
to
be
viewed
a
whole
in
the
light
of
this
lengthy
trial
and
the
lengthy
instructions.
and
let
me
just
add
if
i
may
with
respect
to
one
other
point,
which
was
whether
the
instructions
were
adequate
to
show
participation
in
the
conspiracy,
the
judge
repeatedly,
repeatedly
charged
the
jury.
in
order
to
convict,
they
had
to
determine
that
each
defendant
individually
knowingly
joined
in
the
conspiracy
charged
in
the
indictment.
