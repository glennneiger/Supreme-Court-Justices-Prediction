mr.
fred
h.
bartlit,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
for
an
hour,
we've
heard
very
distinguished
antitrust
counsel
debate
serious
complex
issues
on
antitrust
policy
and
economic
policy.
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
to
bring
this
down
to
the
brass
tax
of
the
individuals
in
this
case.
a
man
like
andrew
watt,
an
executive
of
this
company
could,
under
the
instructions
given
by
the
trial
judge,
be
convicted
of
a
crime
where
his
sole
purpose
was
to
comply
with
the
law
and
where
it
was
reasonable
for
him
to
believe
that.
now,
mr.
watt
went
with
usg
in
the
early
1960s.
the
company
was
the
subject
of
many
robinson-patman
suits.
he
was
instructed
by
the
lawyers
hired
by
his
employer
that
if
he
didn't
comply
with
the
robinson-patman
act,
he
can
lose
his
job.
he
was
told
that
price
verification
was
for
the
purpose
of
complying
with
the
act.
he
was
told
that
it
was
lawful.
he
complied
with
that
advice.
container
came
down
in
early
1969
within
a
month.
from
the
time
container
came
down,
mr.
watt
talked
to
his
lawyers
again
and
sent
a
letter
to
everybody
in
us
gypsum
and
said,
“don't
verify
anymore
on
any
products.”
he
himself
had
stopped
from
in
gypsum
some
months
earlier.
his
conduct
in
verifying
was
upheld
by
a
federal
district
judge
after
a
full
trial
in
1971.
since
that
time,
three
courts
of
appeals,
the
ninth
circuit
including
judge
lumbard
sitting
from
the
second
circuit,
the
third
circuit,
and
the
tenth
circuit
have
all
in
one
way
or
another
approved
the
concept
of
complying
with
the
robinson-patman
act
as
a
--
an
exception
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
as
not
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
mr.
watt
was
indicted
and
convicted
for
conduct
that
eight
appellate
judges
thought
was
lawful.
mr.
watt,
i
represent
him
at
trial
tendered
the
only
instruction
at
that
time
that
had
ever
been
approved
by
any
reviewing
court.
we
have
no
choice.
that
was
the
only
law
we
have.
the
ninth
circuit
said
in
the
gray
case
that
it
was
plausible
under
existing
law
for
an
individual
to
believe
that
verification
was
required
to
conform
with
robinson-patman
obligations.
it
was
a
fact
issue
for
the
jury.
now,
if
the
ninth
circuit
thought
that
it
was
plausible
in
1972
to
believe
that
you
were
complying
with
the
robinson-patman
law
in
verifying,
how
could
mr.
watt
or
his
lawyers
believe
to
the
contrary?the
trial
court
said
that
it
would
give
the
substance
of
that
instruction
but
it
did
not.
marks
versus
united
states,
decision
of
this
court
says
that,
“persons
have
the
right
to
fair
warning
that
their
conduct
--
fair
warning
of
the
kind
of
conduct
that
gives
rise
to
criminal
penalties.”
individuals
have
that
right
and
this
court
said
it's
a
fundamental
constitutional
right.
if
all
of
those
appellate
court
judges
both
couldn't
perceive
that
robinson-patman
verification
was
unlawful,
how
could
andrew
watt
have
fair
warning?
with
regard
to
the
other
issues,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
government
has
made
a
--
quite
a
concession
in
its
reply
brief.
in
the
reply
brief,
the
government
states
that
the
--
at
page
15,
that
the
judge
told
the
foreman
that
he
preferred
a
verdict
to
a
hung
jury.
now,
i
don't
know
think
--
i
think
that
the
facts
are
much
stronger
than
that
concession
because
i
think
you
can
look
at
what
the
foreman
said
and
what
the
jury
was
saying
and
it's
easy
to
conclude
that
the
jury
was
convinced
that
a
deadlock
was
not
acceptable.
but
the
government
conceives
that
the
trial
judge
told
the
foreman
that
he
preferred
a
verdict
to
a
hung
jury.
mr.
fred
h.
bartlit,
jr.
yes,
sir,
he
can.
mr.
fred
h.
bartlit,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
think
you
have
to
consider
this
against
the
background
of
what
have
gone
before.
and
if
we
had
known,
for
example,
that
the
trial
judge
was
going
to
tell
the
foreman
that
he
preferred
a
hung
jury
then
we
would
have
been
entitled
to
an
instruction
which
inform
the
jury
that
the
jury
also
has
a
right
to
deadlock
if
those
are
their
honest
beliefs.
mr.
watt,
colon
brown,
j.
nicely,
the
individual
defendants
on
this
case,
if
the
court
please,
were
entitled
to
have
the
jurors
cling
to
their
honestly
held
beliefs
if
they
were
those
beliefs.
and
when
the
judge
indicated
his
desire,
his
preference
that
the
jury
not
deadlock,
we
were
entitled
to
an
instruction
that
the
jury
was
entitled
to
hold
those
beliefs
and
a
deadlock
was
constitutionally
acceptable.
mr.
fred
h.
bartlit,
jr.
i
think
there's
a
problem,
your
honor,
whenever
there's
a
private
meeting
between
the
judge
and
one
member
of
the
jury.
we
consented
to
that
meeting
because
we
felt
we
had
no
choice.
i
think
that
there's
a
reason
why
there's
a
rule
against
hearsay.
i
think
the
reason
is
that
secondhand
statements
are
generally
don't
come
out
the
way
they
were
intended
and
i
think
it's
clear
here
that
chances
of
the
foreman
reemphasized
the
judges'
statement
and
the
judges'
belief
that
a
deadlock
was
unacceptable
or
great.
mr.
fred
h.
bartlit,
jr.
no,
sir.
we
asked
for
the
transcript
immediately
and
as
the
--
excuse
me
--
mr.
fred
h.
bartlit,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
fred
h.
bartlit,
jr.
we
feel
that
the
voice
of
the
meeting
was
not
that
it
was
private
because
i
consented
to
that.
mr.
fred
h.
bartlit,
jr.
i
consent
to
it
again.
the
voice
of
the
meeting
was
what
judge
said
about
the
meeting
and,
you
know,
candor
his
description
of
a
meeting
to
us
which
was
found
by
the
court
of
appeals
not
to
be
accurate
and
prevented
us
then
from
asking
for
the
kind
of
instruction
to
which
were
entitled.
that
was
the
voice
of
the
meeting.
mr.
fred
h.
bartlit,
jr.
yes,
sir,
that's
right.
mr.
fred
h.
bartlit,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
fred
h.
bartlit,
jr.
no,
sir.
that
issue
is
not
before
this
court,
as
i
understand
it,
and
we
are
addressing
only
the
issues.
the
sufficiency
issue
is
not
before
this
court,
as
i
understand.
mr.
fred
h.
bartlit,
jr.
i
represent
only
andrew
watt,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
h.
bartlit,
jr.
i
undertook
to
the
extent
that
the
instructional
errors
and
the
jury
coercion
bore
on
the
rights
of
those
two
individuals'
honest
appeal
i
undertook
to.
mr.
fred
h.
bartlit,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
fred
h.
bartlit,
jr.
that's
my
understanding.
the
petition
is
still
pending.
their
petition
for
separate
belief
--
mr.
fred
h.
bartlit,
jr.
--
on
a
sufficiency
point
is
still
pending.
it's
not
been
acted
on
by
this
court.
mr.
fred
h.
bartlit,
jr.
thank
you.
