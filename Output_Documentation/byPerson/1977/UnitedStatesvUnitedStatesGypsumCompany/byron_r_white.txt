it's
the
price.
justice
byron
r.

mr.
friedman,
why
shouldn't
there
--
why
shouldn't
the
significance
of
the
effect
on
prices
be
merely
evidence
of
an
agreement
to
affect
prices?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
should
the
--
should
the
jury
--
must
not
the
jury
have
to
conclude
that
there
is
a
conspiracy
or
agreement
to
set
prices
or
to
affect
prices?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
you
agree
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
the
--
and
that
the
--
so
that
the
whole
function
of
proving
effect
would
be
to
lead
the
jury
to
conclude
that
there
is
a
conspiracy
to
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
just
the
bare
statement
of
the
government's
position
and
even
the
bare
statement
that
you
can
get
on
container,
both
the
majority
and
the
dissent
would
indicate
that
if
you
just
have
an
agreement
to
exchange
price
information
and
you
have
the
effect
of
--
and
you
had
--
it
has
an
effect
on
prices
that
there
is
--
a
violation
has
been
proved.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
you
should
go
through
the
litany
and
say
if
--
if
there
is
an
agreement
is
to
exchange
price
information
and
then
there
is
an
effect
on
prices,
do
you
say
then
as
a
matter
of
law,
it
must
be
concluded
that
there
is
an
agreement
to
set,
to
fix
prices?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
whichever
way
you
put
it,
if
there
is
more
to
it
and
just
--
just
saying
that
you
have
to
have
an
agreement.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
but
i
just
asked
--
i
just
asked
the
solicitor
general's
--
here
if
--
the
effect
just
as
--
is
the
--
is
the
instrument
to
or
the
vehicle
or
the
evidence
of
a
conspiracy
to
set
prices.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
there
is
a
conspiracy
to
set
prices,
it's
purposeful.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
say
--
would
you
say
that
it
would
be
--
that
a
jury
verdict
--
if
a
jury
is
told
that
you
must
find
a
conspiracy
to
set
prices,
which
means
purposeful
agreement,
if
you
must
find
that
but
then
it
is
instructed
that
you
may
but
you
need
not
find
it,
if
you
find
an
agreement
to
exchange
information
plus
an
effect
upon
prices,
now
was
that
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
a
jury
comes
--
if
a
jury
then
finds
the
defendant's
guilty,
would
you
say
that
as
a
--
should
be
upset?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
--
you
say
those
two
facts
aren't
enough
to
infer
from
which
a
jury
could
infer
a
conspiracy
to
set
prices?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
don't
think
the
jury
here
was
instructed
that
find
the
defendant
is
guilty
if
they
found
an
effect
on
prices,
will
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
must
or
may?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
that
is
may?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
wanted
--
were
they
required
to
find
it
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
wouldn't
--
if
the
jury
were
properly
instructed
that
they
must
find
a
purposeful
agreement
to
set
prices
and
then
said,
but
you
may,
but
you
didn't
infer
such
an
--
no
legal
conspiracy
from
an
agreement
to
exchange
prices
plus
stability
and
the
jury
came
back
with
a
verdict
and
that's
all
the
facts
there
were.
would
you
think
the
jury
was
--
if
--
wouldn't
step
with
the
verdict
stand
up?
would
there
be
enough
evidence
to
sustain
that?
