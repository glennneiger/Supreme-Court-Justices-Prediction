of
course
the
trial
judge's
instructions
also
said
that,
“if
the
sole
purpose
was
good
faith
in
compliance
with
the
robinson-patman
act,
there's
no
violation.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,

well,
his
first
instruction
says,
“if
you
decide,
this
on
1721,
that
if
this
was
merely
done
in
a
good
faith
effort
to
comply
with
the
robinson-patman
act,
then
you
could
not
consider
verification
standing
alone
as
establishing
an
agreement
to
fix,
raise,
maintain,
and
stabilize
prices
as
charged.”
he
says,
in
words,
as
i
read
them
that
if
--
if
they
found
compliance
with
the
robinson-patman
act
to
be
the
sole
motive,
there
is
no
--
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
justice

j.

right.
justice

and
when
they
consented,
what
options
did
the
judge
give
them?
what
were
the
options
open
to
the
defendant?
justice
william
j.

rather
they're
not
talking
to
him
at
all?
