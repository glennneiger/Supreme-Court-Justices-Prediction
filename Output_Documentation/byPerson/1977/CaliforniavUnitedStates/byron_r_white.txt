justice
byron
r.
white
who
did
the
adjudication
here,
the
water
board?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
suppose
that
there
had
been
a
determination
by
the
federal
authority
so
that
these
deficiencies
in
the
federal
scheme
that
the
board
found
were
resolved,
that
they
did
have
a
need
for
the
water,
they
had
established
a
need
for
the
water
and
etcetera,
and
suppose
they
needed
then
irrigation
and
the
federals
have
done
as
much
as
they
possibly
could
to
establish
this
need,
now
i
take
it
you
would
not
suggest
that
the
board
could
say
“we
just
do
not
allow
water
to
be
used
for
irrigation
in
this
state?"
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
because
of
some
specific
provision
in
the
federal
act,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
state’s
position
is
that
if
congress
makes
a
determination
that
if
there
is
any
unappropriated
water
in
california
and
it
decides
clearly
and
finally
to
use
some
water
for
irrigation
and
they
have
a
project
to
develop
the
water,
that
the
california
board
must
appropriate
the
water
to
it
for
use
of
irrigation
even
though
some
state
agency
wanted
to
use
it,
it
would
have
to
save
it
for
municipal
purposes?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
under
a
particular
reclamation
act
however
that
the
congress
gives
to
the
secretary
rule-making
authority
to
do
certain
things
and
until
he
does
them,
there
is
no
conflict
with
the
state
and
when
he
does,
there
is
a
conflict.
arguably,
at
least
then
congress
has
overridden
its
section
8
itself.
section
8,
after
all,
is
just
a
statute
and
congress
can
amend
it
expressly
or
impliedly?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
some
statutes,
they
have
repeated
section
8,
but
not
all
of
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
there
happen
to
be
a
specific
provision
in
a
future
reclamation
statute
and
specific
congressional
provision
that
would
require
something
that
would
not
be
required?
justice
byron
r.
white
then,
it
would
override
section
8?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
it
says
“in
such
areas
as
the
secretary
shall,
in
his
complete
discretion,
determine”?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
then
you
would
think
that
congress
could
constitutionally
pass
an
act
that
says
“we
know
the
western
states
have
been
managing
the
appropriation
of
waters,
but
we
are
going
to
have
a
national
system
to
appropriate
the
waters
from
all
of
the
unappropriated
water
that
exist
in
western
streams.
we
are
going
to
have
a
national
administrative
operation
to
do
it?”
justice
byron
r.
white
unappropriated
water.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
a
sense,
that
is
what
you
are
saying.
in
a
sense,
you
had
answered
that
question
before
when
you
answered
justice
rehnquist,
that
in
the
reclamation
acts
to
some
extent
congress
does
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
understand
to
be
their
reason
for
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
what
about
the
project?
there
are
some
other
reasons
that
congress
has
failed
to
appropriate
money
for
part
of
an
anticipated
project?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
what
i
thought.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
wrong
with
that
reason
for
denying
the
permit?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
he
did
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
may
be
the
remedy,
but
what
is
wrong
with
the
board
saying
“you
have
exceeded
your
authority.
you
should
not
even
be
here
asking
or
water,
as
far
as
we
can
tell,”
is
that
beyond
their
cognizance?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
did
he
even
know
how
much
to
ask
for?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
part
of
that
projected
need
is
something
that
congress
has
not
appropriated
the
money
for?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
project
that
your
colleagues
have
referred
to
that
has
washed
out?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
outside
the
watershed?
it
is
not,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
barnett?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
you
said,
in
substance,
that
the
conditions
are
the
heart
of
this
case.
if
your
position
is
that
california
has
no
authority
to
impose
any
conditions,
what
difference
does
it
make?
what
do
these
conditions
provide?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
united
states
government
is
required
to
seek
a
permit
from
california?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
a
matter
of
power,
what
would
your
answer
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
the
california
board
determines
whether
or
not
there
is
sufficient
unappropriated
water?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
barnett,
could
you
put
a
finger
on
a
second
or
two
on
what
you
think
it
is
that
gives
california
or
any
of
the
other
appropriation
states
the
right
to
have
a
system
of
water
law
under
which
people
can
have
their
appropriations
validated
and
acquire
property
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
hold
for
you
that
we
have
to
disembowel
arizona
v.
california
to
some
extent
and
ivanhoe?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
ivanhoe?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
did
say
something
about
section
8
specifically.
do
you
agree
with
the
language
in
section
8?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
do
you
disagree
with
them?
