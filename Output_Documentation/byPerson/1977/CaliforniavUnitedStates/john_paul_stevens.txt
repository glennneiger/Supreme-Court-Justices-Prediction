justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
one
question
which
is
i
see
you
are
starting
a
new
part
of
your
argument,
a
follow
up
of
the
earlier
colloquy
we
had.
supposing
the
state
of
california
had
a
homesteading
program
whereby
state-owned
land
was
made
available
to
citizens
of
california
who
were
willing
to
reside
there
for
two
years
and
the
united
states
came
in
and
said
“we
find
that
it
is
just
necessary
to
take
a
lot
of
this
homestead
land
for
the
new
melones
project.”
do
you
think
it
would
have
the
right
to
do
that
without
paying
california
for
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
why
do
you
think
that
congress
has
the
right
to
take
unappropriated
water
from
the
state?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
interrupt
you?
it
all
sounds
very
easy,
but
you
often
get
ambiguous
statutes
and
you
often
refer
to
the
secretary
as
head
of
an
agency
and
construing
his
authority,
how
do
you
decide
which
way
to
resolve
the
conflict?
does
the
state
water
board
always
resolve
the
dispute?
how
do
you
get
these
boarder
line
decisions
determined?
who
has
the
dispute
resolution
power?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
we
have
to
assume
that
this
case
indicates
there
are
such
possible
conflicts?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
say
they
have
the
power
to
impose
some
conditions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
not
conditions
which
conflict
with
congressional
policy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
the
secretary
takes
the
view
that
the
condition
does
conflict
with
congressional
policy,
how
do
you
decide
whether
it
does
or
it
does
not?
who
decides
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
always
have
litigation
over
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
potential
for
that
dispute
produced
170-page
brief
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
so
i
get
it
right.
the
state
imposes
a
condition.
say,
you
are
going
to
impose
some
conditions,
you
impose
10
conditions,
the
united
states
thinks
four
of
them
conflict
with
the
policy
of
the
act.
they
then
have
to
file
a
declaratory
judgment
action,
that
is
the
way
they
do
it
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
california
review
in
the
state
judicial
system,
they
could
not
bring
suit
in
the
federal
district
court
and
ask
for
declaratory
judgment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
the
federal
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
arguing
it
in
the
federal
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
starting
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
barnett,
in
the
district
court
or
in
the
court
of
appeal,
did
you
take
the
position
as
you
do
here
that
one
must
study
the
25
conditions
to
decide
whether
the
state
can
impose
any
conditions
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
you
still
maintain
that
they
have
no
power
to
impose
any
conditions,
why
do
we
have
to
study
the
25
conditions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
are
going
to
the
conditions
without
even
arguing
the
first
point,
that
is
why
i
was
puzzled
about
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
those
acts
depended
for
their
effect
on
the
existence
of
public
land
in
those
states.
there
never
was
any
public
land
in
the
original
time
or
the
13
original
colonies.
so
surely,
they
are
not
dependent
on
the
sufferance
of
congress
or
those
acts
for
any
authority
to
determine
water
ownership,
are
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
petitioner
would
say
if
your
facts
are
right,
you
would
agree
the
condition
is
improper?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
he
said
that
if
the
condition
would
interfere
with
the
congressional
determination
of
what
the
statute
is
supposed
to
accomplish,
the
state
had
no
power
to
hold
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
turning
it
around
just
a
moment,
i
understood
part
of
their
reasoning
to
be
that
while
you
have
got
a
lot
of
other
water
in
this
overall
project
and
so
you
do
not
need
this
specific
source
for
the
time
being
at
least
for
consumptive
purposes,
if
they
were
right
factually,
would
they
not
be
right
legally
also?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
it
is
an
integrated
project
and
if
the
total
project
has
enough
water
for
those
four
counties,
why
is
this
condition
an
objection?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
it
is
a
temporary
thing,
was
it
not?
did
they
not
say,
for
the
time
being?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
meant
that
some
of
the
conditions
were
temporary?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
take
it
you
think
that
this
court
has
already,
two
or
three
times,
construed
section
8
the
way
you
think
it
should
be
construed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
barnett,
can
i
ask
one
other
question.
i
was
just
looking
at
your
complaint.
you
did
not
ask
for
a
declaration
that
all
conditions
be
declared
void,
just
those
that
were
in
contravention
of
federal
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
sorry.
i
see.
you
are
right.
it
goes
on
which
are
not
specifically
authorized?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see
i
am
just
wondering
if
it
is
possible
if
this
case
would
be
easier
to
decide
if
the
trial
judge
had
decided
which
conditions
conflict
with
federal
law
and
which
do
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
told
us
to
study
all
25
conditions
in
order
to
decide
what
the
law
is.
you
imposed
an
awful
big
piece
of
effort
on
us?
