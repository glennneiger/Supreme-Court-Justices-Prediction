mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court.
the
issue
before
the
court
today
is
whether
section
8
of
the
reclamation
act
of
1902
requires
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
comply
with
state
regulatory
water
laws
when
he
acquires
and
uses
water
under
that
particular
act.
section
8
embodies
a
fundamental
historical
principle
of
the
federal
reclamation
laws,
a
principle
that
within
some
yet
undefined
limits
the
states
have
some
measure
of
control
over
the
use
in
the
distribution
of
such
water.
thus,
the
principle
in
this
case
is
one
of
ultimate
historic
significance,
we
believe.
it
is
whether
that
substantive
principle
of
the
federal
reclamation
laws
will
remain
a
viable
principle
of
those
laws.
during
my
argument
this
afternoon,
i
intend
to
focus
on
what
we
consider
to
be
the
three
major
issues
before
the
court.
first,
did
congress
in
fact,
in
1902,
establish
a
principle
of
state
control
of
water,
did
congress
actually
give
that
power
to
the
states?
secondly,
if
it
did,
how
do
we
reconcile
that
principle
with
the
many
substantive
congressional
policies
that
congress
has
enacted
in
the
field
of
reclamation,
both
in
the
1902
act
and
in
later
acts?
in
other
words,
how
do
we
reconcile
potential
conflicts
between
state
and
federal
policies?
third,
how
do
we
reconcile
the
principle
of
state
control
with
the
broad
discretion
which
congress
has
given
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
carry
out
the
substantive
congressional
policies?
now,
let
me
turn
to
the
facts
of
the
case.
the
reclamation
act
of
1902
essentially
provides
for
federal
construction
and
operation
of
reclamation
facilities
in
about
17
western
states.
under
the
authority
of
that
act,
congress
has
authorized
a
number
of
reclamation
facilities
in
california
that
are
collectively
known
as
the
central
valley
project.
the
bureau
of
reclamation
has
always
complied
with
california
regulatory
water
laws
in
acquiring
its
water
rights
for
the
central
valley
project.
it
has
always
submitted
permit
applications
to
the
california
resources
control
board.
the
board
has
always
granted
permits
to
the
bureau.
the
board
has
usually
imposed
conditions
in
those
permits.
the
bureau
has
always
complied
with
the
conditions
in
the
permits.
in
fact,
since
1927
the
state
board
had
issued
12
major
decisions
that
result
in
the
issuance
of
conditional
permits
to
the
bureau
of
reclamation.
then,
in
1973,
the
united
states
filed
its
present
action
for
declaratory
judgment.
in
this
action,
it
asked
the
court
to
determine
that
the
bureau
of
reclamation
need
not
comply
with
california’s
appropriation
procedure
and,
thus,
that
it
need
not
comply
with
conditions
in
the
permits
which
have
been
issued
to
the
bureau.
the
affect
of
this
position,
of
course,
would
be
to
void
the
conditions
in
all
12
decisions
which
have
been
issued
by
the
state
board.
a
way
of
illustration,
the
united
states
in
its
complaint
referred
to
a
specific
decision
called
decision
1422.
this
decision
results
in
the
issuance
of
conditional
permits
to
the
bureau
of
reclamation
for
the
new
melones
project
on
stanislaus
river
in
california.
the
new
melones
project
is
a
dam
and
reservoir
facility
that
was
authorized
by
congress
in
1944
and
it
was
reauthorized
in
1962.
in
its
complaint,
the
united
states
argues
that
the
state
board
lacks
power
under
and
any
and
all
circumstances
to
impose
any
kind
of
condition
upon
the
federal
water
right.
in
california,
by
way
of
contrast,
argues
that
california
has
a
qualified
power
to
impose
conditions.
it
argues
that
it
can
impose
conditions
if
those
conditions
do
not
impair
or
interfere
with
the
basic
congressionally
authorized
purposes
of
federal
reclamation
projects.
the
lower
court
upheld
the
position
of
the
united
states.
it
held
that
the
state
board
is
without
power
to
impose
conditions
under
any
and
all
circumstances,
that
there
is
not
circumstance
where
such
a
condition
can
be
imposed
upon
an
appropriate
permit
issued
to
the
bureau.
on
that
basis,
the
court
granted
summary
judgment
for
the
united
states.
the
court
did
not
reach
the
question
whether
the
conditions
of
decision
1422
or
for
that
matter
any
other
decision
issued
by
the
state
board,
in
fact,
conflict
with
any
congressionally
authorized
purposes
of
the
project.
it
avoided
that
question
because
it
held
the
question
was
simply
not
relevant.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
it
reflects
the
position
of
the
united
states,
justice
rehnquist.
we
have
maintained
throughout
this
litigation
that
the
state
has
the
power
to
impose
conditions
under
section
8
of
the
reclamation
act,
which
i
will
momentarily
describe.
we
also
will
point
out
momentarily
that
congress
has,
subsequent
to
1902,
adapted
a
number
of
reclamation
policies
and
established
the
individual
reclamation
projects.
in
our
view,
every
time
congress
establishes
such
a
policy
or
authorizes
such
a
project,
it
subtracts
from
the
authority
which
it
originally
gave
the
states
in
1902.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes,
very
definitely.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes.
as
i
understand
gerlach,
the
court
was
merely
holding
that
in
that
particular
case
section
8
required
reference
to
state
law.
what
you
are
suggesting
in
the
hypothetical,
justice
rehnquist,
that
congress
might
override
section
8.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
i
think
that
it
would
have
that
power
under
either
the
commerce
clause
or
the
property
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution.
there
are
decisions
of
this
court,
by
the
way,
going
back
to
1907
that
give
a
contrary
view.
for
instance,
in
kansas
v.
colorado,
this
court
seems
to
suggest
that
congress
did
not
have
that
constitutional
power.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
we
think
that
a
fair
analysis
of
this
court’s
decisions
in
ivanhoe
and
fresno
would
support
the
concept
that
congress
has
that
its
constitutional
power
because,
in
those
cases,
the
court
essentially
held
that
congress
could
override
state
water
laws
in
specific
areas.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
congress
could
certainly
condemn
them
under
the
authority
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
no,
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
i
was
assuming
a
broader
question
perhaps
from
justice
rehnquist.
i
thought
you
were
talking
about
unappropriated
water
generally,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
absolutely,
very
definitely,
but
that
is
not
the
issue.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
the
unappropriated
water,
that
is
correct.
that
is
the
issue
here.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
with
respect
to
unappropriated
water,
we
think
united
states
would
have
the
power
under
the
commerce
clause
and
the
property
clause
of
the
us
constitution
to
acquire
such
water.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
i
would
say
that
this
court’s
decision
in
the
beaver
portland
case,
for
example,
holds
that
the
states
essentially
have
the
right
to
control
the
unappropriated
water
of
the
western
states,
but
is
subject
to
two
major
congressional
constitutional
limitations.
one
limitation
is
found
in
the
commerce
clause
and
the
other
is
found
in
the
property
clause.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
i
think
it
can
exercise
that
power
under
either
the
commerce
clause
or
the
property
clause.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
possibly
also.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
i
think
that
in
the
ivanhoe
case,
the
court
did
make
reference
to
the
welfare
clause,
but
i
think
that
the
traditional
approach
that
this
court
has
taken
in
most
cases
has
been
to
rely
on
the
commerce
clause
and
the
property
clause.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
that
did
not
involve
a
navigational
servitude?
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
i
cannot
think
of
any.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
the
court
has
usually
held
that
the
commerce
clause
and
the
navigational
servitude
are
essentially
the
same.
in
its
1899
decision
in
rio
grande,
it
seem
to
suggest
that
there
might
be
a
commerce
clause
power
to
take
water
as
part
of
the
navigational
servitude,
but
i
do
not
think
this
court
has
ever
held
that
where
navigation
is
not
concerned,
congress
has
powers
under
the
commerce
clause
to
take
unappropriated
water.
i
hate,
of
course,
to
be
defending
the
position
of
the
united
states
in
this
litigation
at
this
point,
but
essentially,
what
we
are
really
talking
about
in
this
case
is
whether
congress
in
fact
required
the
bureau
of
reclamation
to
comply
with
state
law
in
acquiring
unappropriated
water.
the
issue
in
the
case
is
precisely
that.
did
congress
in
section
8,
provide
that
the
bureau
of
reclamation
must
comply
with
state
water
laws?
if
the
state
board
lacks
a
qualified
power
to
impose
any
kind
of
conditions
on
the
federal
water
right,
then
the
conditions
of
all
12
decisions,
which
the
state
board
has
issued,
including
the
decision
1422,
would
be
void.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
the
state
board
has
that
power,
then
the
conditions
of
all
12
decisions,
we
think,
are
beyond
collateral.
in
fact,
for
the
reason
that
united
states
has
never
chosen
to
seek
direct
judicial
review
of
any
of
those
decisions
and
in
any
event,
surely,
the
court
cannot
examine
the
conditions
of
any
particular
decision
in
this
case
because
that
matter
was
not
before
the
lower
court
and
the
lower
court
did
not
take
any
evidence
on
the
question.
this
brings
me
to
what
i
consider
to
be
a
first
major
question
before
the
court
and
that
is
whether
congress,
in
fact
in
1902,
established
the
principle
that
the
states
have
the
right
to
control
water
from
the
federal
reclamation
projects
under
the
1902
act.
section
8
specifically
provides
that
the
secretary
shall
“proceed
in
conformity
with
state
laws
relating
to
the
control,
appropriation,
use,
or
distribution
of
water.”
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
no,
i
do
not
believe
that
it
would.
i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
any
decision
of
this
court
which
would
support
the
united
states
in
that
endeavor.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
that
is
true
and
this
court
has
always
avoided
that
question.
in
fact,
in
the
1945
decision
in
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
i
do
not
recall
that
off
hand.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
not
in
terms
of
ownership.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
pardon
me?
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
correct,
the
court
has
never
held
that
united
states
owns
the
unappropriated
water
of
the
western
states.
it
has
held,
however,
that
the
united
states
might
have
some
overriding
constitutional
powers
that
enable
it
to
act
and
establish
a
certain
degree
of
control
over
those
waters.
but
it
has
not
actually
established
that
united
states
has
the
power
to
actually
own
the
water
itself.
let
me
turn
now
to
the
language
of
section
8
itself.
the
section,
on
its
face,
requires
the
secretary
to
proceed
in
conformity
with
state
laws
relating
to
the
control,
appropriation,
use,
and
distribution
of
water.
on
its
face,
this
section
clearly
requires
federal
compliance
with
state
appropriation
laws.
state
appropriation
laws,
in
turn,
provide
for
state
regulatory
control
of
water.
this
is
the
way
the
states
control
the
water.
they
control
the
water
through
their
appropriation
laws.
they
determine
the
beneficial
use
of
their
water.
they
thus
manage
and
control
their
limited
water
supply.
thus,
the
section
on
its
face,
requires
the
federal
government
to
be
treated
as
a
private
appropriator
under
the
state’s
appropriation
laws.
essentially,
the
united
states
makes
two
arguments
with
respect
to
the
meaning
of
section
8.
first,
it
argues
that
the
section
does
not
require
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
comply
with
state
laws
relating
to
unappropriated
water,
but
that
the
secretary
merely
does
so
as
a
matter
of
comity.
he
does
not
have
to
do
it.
he
simply
does
it
because
he
chooses
to
do
it.
secondly,
the
united
states
argues
that
if
section
8
actually
requires
him
to
comply
with
state
laws,
it
requires
him
only
to
comply
with
the
so-called
forms
of
state
law.
the
forms
of
state
law
are
defined
by
the
united
states
as
consisting
of
all
state
laws
other
than
those
that
provide
for
regulatory
control
of
water.
this
conclusion,
we
think,
is
wholly
inconsistent
with
the
language
of
section
8
itself.
the
language
says
that
the
secretary
shall
proceed,
not
may
proceed
or
could
proceed
or
should
proceed,
but
shall
proceed
in
conformity
with
state
law
and,
thus,
suggest
that
he
does
not
do
so
as
a
matter
of
comity.
secondly,
the
section
specifically
refers
to
state
laws
relating
to
the
control
of
the
use
and
the
distribution
of
water.
those
are
the
words
in
the
section
itself,
control,
use,
and
distribution.
these
are
terms,
obviously,
that
include
state
regulatory
control.
the
result
which
we
suggest
is
even
more
clear
we
think,
under
the
legislative
history
of
the
reclamation
act
of
1902
and
with
the
court’s
indulgence,
i
would
like
to
just
briefly
make
reference
to
a
couple
of
selected
portions
of
the
legislative
history
that
we
think
shows
the
overwhelming
sentiment
of
the
1902
congress
for
the
principle
of
state
control.
if
the
court
would,
i
would
like
to
refer
to
our
brief
in
the
case
which
is
the
blue
brief,
the
brief
for
the
petitioners.
you
turn
first,
if
you
would,
to
page
25
and
just
listen
to
the
language
of
congressman
mondell
of
wyoming
who
is
the
floor
leader
for
section
8
and
in
fact,
the
entire
reclamation
bill
when
it
was
before
the
house
of
representatives.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes,
that
is
correct.
that
is
the
blue
brief.
upon
halfway
down
in
the
italicized
portion
of
the
brief,
congressman
mondell
states,
“the
secretary
of
the
interior
would
proceed
to
make
the
appropriation
of
the
necessary
water
by
giving
the
notice
and
complying
with
the
forms
of
the
law,
of
the
state,
or
territory
in
which
the
works
are
located.”
the
united
states
essentially
concedes
that
that
language
is
not
consistent
with
its
comity
argument,
but
it
makes
the
argument
that
this
language
is
consistent
with
its
so-called
form
argument.
without
arguing
that
point,
without
arguing
whether
congressman
mondell
actually
meant
to
suggest
a
distinction
between
the
forms
and
the
substance
of
state
law,
it
is
very
clear
from
other
portions
of
the
legislative
history
that
no
such
distinction
was
intended.
for
instance
refer,
if
the
court
would,
to
page
of
27
of
our
opening
brief.
again,
congressman
mondell
speaking,
this
is
the
quote
that
appears
near
the
top
of
the
page,
“section
8
follows
the
well-established
principle
and
national
legislation
of
recognizing
local
and
state
laws
relative
to
the
appropriation
and
distribution
of
water
and
instructs
the
secretary
of
the
interior
in
carrying
out
the
provisions
of
the
act
to
conform
to
these
laws.”
back
on
page
24,
the
floor
leader
for
the
bill
in
the
senate,
senator
clark
of
wyoming
stated,
this
quotation
appears
halfway
down
the
page,
“it
is
right
that
in
the
general
government
should
control,
should
conserve,
and
should
reservoir
the
headwaters
of
these
streams,
in
this
it
is
a
national
and
not
a
state
proposition,
but
in
the
distribution
of
these
waters,
it
is
right
and
proper
that
the
various
states
and
territories
should
control
in
the
distribution.
the
conditions
in
each
and
every
state
territory
are
different.
what
would
be
applicable
in
one
locality
is
totally
and
absolutely
inapplicable
in
another.”
the
united
states
essentially
makes
no
response
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
essentially,
senator
clark
was
referring
to
all
the
western
states,
we
believe,
which
all
have
a
lack
of
water.
there
is
very
little
water
in
all
the
western
states,
but
essentially,
the
water
he
was
talking
about
was
unappropriated
water
because
that
is
the
one
the
federal
government
normally
requires
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
the
differences
between
what,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
well,
some
states
have
and
some
portions
of
states
have
highly
developed
metropolitan
areas.
other
states
and
other
portions
of
other
states
have
undeveloped
rural
areas.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
right,
exactly.
in
california,
for
example,
we
need
water
for
purposes
that
may
not
exactly
apply
in
montana
or
wyoming.
wyoming
needs
water
for
agriculture
and
irrigation
primarily.
california
and
especially
the
developed
metropolitan
areas
of
california
need
water
for
municipal
use
because
of
certain
environmental
balances
and,
in
fact,
in
some
cases
imbalances
in
these
states,
water
in
some
instances,
must
be
made
available
for
environmental
protection.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
no,
not
at
all.
i
think
in
1902
congress
was
just
getting
this
program
off
the
ground.
they
felt
that
the
best
way
to
proceed
would
be
to
proceed
by
having
the
secretary
of
the
interior
comply
with
state
law
because
the
states
had
always
controlled
their
unappropriated
waters.
in
fact,
this
court
had
recognized
the
tradition
a
number
of
times,
that
the
states
traditionally
control
their
unappropriated
waters.
the
same
tradition
was
recognized
by
congress
back
in
the
mining
acts
of
1866
and
the
dessert
land
act
of
1877.
the
states
essentially
have
traditionally
controlled
their
unappropriated
waters
and
congress
in
1902,
quite
evidently,
wanted
to
continue
and
extend
that
tradition.
an
examination
of
the
administrative
practice,
that
occurred
after
the
1902
act
was
passed,
shows,
i
think
quite
convincingly,
that
congress
was
actually
successful
in
its
effort
to
provide
for
state
control
of
water
because
the
secretary
of
the
interior
has,
in
fact,
consistently
and
fully
complied
with
state
regulatory
water
laws
in
acquiring
and
using
his
water
under
the
act.
for
instance,
in
california,
the
bureau
of
reclamation
has
always
acquired
appropriative
permits
from
california.
california
has
traditionally
imposed
the
conditions
in
those
permits
and
the
bureau
has
always
complied
with
those
conditions.
until
this
case,
it
never
sought
to
destroy
those
conditions,
but
in
this
case,
the
united
states
is
advancing
the
argument
that
the
secretary
only
complied
with
those
state
laws
as
a
matter
of
comity.
we
think
that
that
is
entirely
inconsistent
with
everything
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
has
said
ever
since
1902
onward
with
respect
to
his
obligation
under
section
8.
in
fact,
even
the
current
operating
regulations
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
embrace
the
principle
of
state
control.
let
me
just
read
from
these.
these
appear
at
page
39
of
our
opening
brief.
these
are
the
current
regulations
of
the
bureau.
“the
reclamation
act
recognizes
the
interests
and
rights
of
the
states
in
the
utilization
and
control
of
their
water
resources
and
requires
the
bureau
in
carrying
out
provisions
of
the
act
to
proceed
in
conformity
with
state
water
laws.”
since
the
construction
of
a
reservoir
and
the
subsequent
storage
and
release
of
water
for
beneficial
purposes
normally
entail
stream
regulation,
it
is
necessary
to
reach
an
understanding
with
the
states
regarding
reservoir
operating
limitations.
thus,
the
secretary
has
always
complied
with
state
law.
he
has
always
said
that
he
is
required
to
do
so
under
section
8.
in
this
case,
the
united
states
was
essentially
trying
to
change
the
rules
of
the
game,
76
years
as
it
were
after
the
game
was
started,
it
is
essentially
trying
to
break
and
destroy
the
historic
relationship
that
has
guided
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
pardon
me?
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
that
is
our
position,
justice
marshall.
let
me
turn
to
that
just
briefly.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
i
think
that
is
true.
in
other
words,
the
states
were
traditionally
imposing
conditions
that
did
not
conflict
with
specific
congressional
policy
and,
thus,
under
those
circumstances
the
secretary
complied
with
those
conditions.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
pardon
me?
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
absolutely.
we
concede
that
the
same
result
applies
here,
justice
marshall.
let
me
address
that
question
more
in
detail.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
obviously,
since
1902,
congress
has
established
a
number
of
substantives
of
reclamation
policies.
it
has
established
and
enacted,
in
fact,
four
different
acts
that
essentially
amend
the
reclamation
act
of
1902.
on
top
of
that,
it
authorizes
individual
reclamation
projects
that
have
basic
congressional
policies
behind
them.
some
experts
in
the
field
of
water
law
and
especially
some
advocates
of
the
state’s
rights
position
have
argued
that
section
8
literally
imposes
no
limits
on
state
control,
and
therefore,
none
should
be
implied,
thus,
under
that
view
the
states
would
have
the
right
to
override
substantive
congressional
policies
and
have
the
right
to
exercise
a
veto
power
over
the
projects.
the
difficulty
with
that
view,
of
course,
is
what
you
are
suggesting,
justice
marshall,
and
that
is
that
the
states
could,
under
those
circumstances,
completely
obliterate
the
congressional
objectives
that
led
to
the
enactment
of
the
federal
reclamation
program
in
the
first
place.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
no.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
that
is
certainly
true.
i
suppose
that
is
true.
i
think
that
there
are
some
staunch
advocates
of
the
position
i
have
just
pointed
out,
certainly
in
the
western
water
schools,
but
at
the
same
time,
that
is
not
the
view
we
are
urging,
justice
marshall.
i
want
to
make
that
very
clear.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
right.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
the
eastern
states
just
do
not
have
the
problem
the
western
states
do.
so
that
is
why
the
reclamation
act
only
applies
to
the
western
states.
the
united
states,
by
the
way,
makes
the
argument
that
in
order
to
preserve
these
congressional
objectives
i
just
talked
about,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
should
have
absolute
control
of
water
uses
under
the
reclamation
act
of
1902.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
that
might
be
a
very
good
policy
argument,
but
it
is
simply
inconsistent
with
what
congress
did
in
1902.
it
is
inconsistent
with
section
8
and
the
principle
of
state
control
that
is
embodied
in
section
8.
thus,
our
view
is
this.
we
think
that
these
various
principles
can
be
harmonized
and
reconciled.
we
think
that
the
principle
of
state
control
should
apply
only
to
the
extent
that
it
is
consistent
with
what
congress
has
actually
intended
to
accomplish
in
the
field
of
reclamation.
in
other
words,
where
there
is
a
clash
or
conflict
between
congressional
policy
and
state
policy,
then
obviously,
congressional
policy
overrides.
on
the
other
hand,
if
there
is
no
such
conflict,
then
state
law
applies
and
that
is
to
say
that
the
states
cannot
override
what
congress
has
done.
by
the
same
token,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
cannot
override
what
the
states
have
done
if
the
states
have
acted
consistently
with
basic
congressional
policy.
in
other
words,
a
federal
bureaucrat
in
sacramento
cannot
decide
to
sell
water
to
an
irrigation
district
on
the
north
side
of
the
sacramento
river
rather
than
the
south
side,
and
then
claim
that
his
decision
represents
congressional
policy
and
then
claim
that
because
his
decision
represents
congressional
policy,
his
decision
overrides
state
law.
because,
if
the
secretary
has
that
power
and
state
law
has
no
room
in
the
federal
reclamation
scheme
and
under
those
circumstances,
the
principle
of
state
control
on
section
8
which
had
been
honored
for
76
years
simply
does
not
exist.
in
fact,
this
i
think
was
the
approach
which
this
court
took
in
two
cases,
in
the
1950s
and
the
1960s
in
the
ivanhoe
and
the
fresno
cases.
in
ivanhoe,
state
law
conflicted
with
the
basic
congressional
policy
that
provides
for
an
acreage
limitation
and
that
is
found
in
section
5
of
the
reclamation
act
of
1902
and
the
court
said
state
law
does
not
apply.
it
cannot
conflict
with
the
specific
congressional
policy.
in
fresno,
state
law
conflicted
with
the
specific
principle
of
the
federal
reclamation
laws
found
in
the
1939
act
that
provides
a
preference
for
water
for
irrigation
purposes
over
municipal
purposes
and
the
court,
again
said
state
law
cannot
apply
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
the
california
state
water
resources
control
board.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
that
is
a
correct
statement
of
our
position,
justice
white.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
no,
because
of
an
interpretation
of
section
8
in
light
of
the
purposes
of
the
act
which
authorize
the
individual
project
in
question.
in
other
words,
congress,
in
authorizing
specific
reclamation
projects,
always
had
basic
purposes
in
mind.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
that
is
correct.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
going
back
to
your
original
question,
justice
rehnquist,
we
think
that
congress
has
the
power
under
the
commerce
property
and
general
welfare
clauses
to
use
the
western
states'
unappropriated
water
in
whatever
ways
are
consistent
with
those
particular
clauses.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
that
is
the
way
i
read
this
court’s
decision
in
the
ivanhoe
case.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
right,
exactly.
if
the
court
wants
to
back
off
of
them,
we
are
certainly
not
going
to
try
to
discriminate
it
in
doing
so.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
pardon
me?
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
i
should
think
so.
it
would
certainly
give
the
states
more
control,
but
at
the
same
time,
i
think
it
is
very
important
for
the
court
to
bear
in
mind
that
california
is
equally
interested
in
the
achievement
of
basic
reclamation
objectives
established
by
congress.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
that
is
correct.
we
do
not
really
perceive
that
there
is
any
conflict
between
what
california
is
trying
to
accomplish
in
this
field
and
what
congress
is
trying
to
accomplish.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes,
that
is
correct.
we
are
conceding
hypothetically
that
there
could
be
a
conflict,
and
if
there
is
a
conflict,
that
must
be
resolved
in
favor
of
congress.
but
i
am
pointing
out,
justice
rehnquist,
that
in
actual
fact
there
have
been
no
such
conflicts
of
any
measurable
degree
between
what
the
states
have
been
trying
to
accomplish
and
what
congress
has
been
trying
to
accomplish.
there
is
no
such
conflict
even
in
this
case.
the
conflict
in
this
case
is
not
between
congress
and
the
state
of
california.
it
is
between
the
state
of
california
and
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
the
secretary
of
the
interior
is
essentially
trying
to
proceed
with
a
number
of
plans
in
california
that
have
no
mandate
under
congressional
law.
he
is
trying
to
proceed
with
plans
that
were
not
considered
or
mandated
by
congress.
thus,
we
feel
what
we
are
doing
is
quite
consistent
with
what
congress
had
in
mind
in
the
field
of
reclamation.
thus,
there
is
no
clash
ultimately
in
this
case
between
federal
and
state
policy.
that
brings
me,
i
think,
to
the
third
major
question
which
i
would
like
to
address
and
that
is
how
we
actually
resolve
the
principles
we
have
been
talking
about
with
the
broad
grant
of
discretion
which
has
been
given
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior
by
congress.
the
united
states’
argument
essentially
is
this.
it
argues
that
congress
has
established
a
very
broad
comprehensive
reclamation
scheme
and
has
vested
the
secretary
of
interior
with
broad
discretion
to
carry
out
that
scheme.
this
scheme
is
so
broad,
according
to
the
united
states,
that
it
leaves
no
room
for
state
control
at
all.
the
secretary
of
the
interior
has
discretion
to
override
state
water
laws
whenever
he
chooses
to
do
so.
thus,
the
united
states
is
really
posing
perhaps
the
ultimate
issue
in
this
case
and
let
me
phrase
it
this
way.
has
congress
in
fact
enacted
a
comprehensive
reclamation
scheme
that
in
fact
leaves
no
room
for
state
regulatory
control
or
instead
does
the
comprehensive
scheme
established
by
congress
include
state
regulatory
laws?
to
phrase
the
proposition
differently,
does
the
secretary
have
a
plenary
discretionary
authority
to
override
state
law
whenever
he
wants
to
do
so
or
instead
does
section
8
limit
his
discretion
by
requiring
him
to
comply
with
state
law
where
there
is
no
basic
conflict
between
state
law
and
congressional
policy.
i
hope
the
court
has
no
illusions
with
respect
to
the
effect
of
the
argument
being
advanced
by
the
united
states.
if
that
argument
is
upheld,
then
section
8
will
have
no
practical
effect
because
the
entire
principle
of
state
control
will
be
subservient
to
the
discretion
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
thus
will
not
exist.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
but
under
the
circumstances
you
gave,
justice
white,
we
do
not
see
that
there
would
be
any
potential
conflict
between
state
and
congressional
policy.
we
think
that
the
secretary
will
be
required
in
exercising
his
discretion
to
carry
out
state
policy
if
he
can
possibly
do
so.
thus,
the
question
is
whether
it
is
possible
for
the
secretary
to
carry
out
his
obligations
under
both
state
and
federal
and
congressional
policy.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
right,
correct,
exactly.
in
other
words,
when
congress
gives
discretion
to
the
secretary,
it
limits
it
by
requiring
him
to
comply
with
state
law
to
the
extent
that
he
can
do
so
consistently
with
his
other
obligations
under
the
reclamation
act.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
when
you
say
some
statutes,
do
you
mean
statutes
that
authorize
individual
projects?
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
i
think,
justice
white,
that
in
all
statutes
the
secretary
is
required
to
operate
the
projects
“pursuant
to
the
federal
reclamation
laws”
which
includes
section
8.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
absolutely.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
precisely.
in
other
words,
if
congress
instructs
the
secretary
of
the
interior
in
its
authorizing
act
to
provide
water
in
area
'a'
of
the
state
of
california,
for
sure,
the
state
of
california
cannot
come
along
and
say
that
water
has
to
be
used
in
area
'b'.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
well,
that
is
a
very
good
question,
justice
white
and
i
think
there
you
get
into
the
question
of
how
you
interpret
section
8
in
light
of
the
discretion
given
to
the
secretary.
our
view
would
be
that
under
those
circumstances,
the
secretary’s
discretion
is
still
limited
by
section
8
in
that
if
he
can
comply
with
state
law
without
violating
a
specific
congressional
mandate,
he
must
do
so.
if
the
result
is
otherwise
then
section
8
just
does
not
mean
anything.
the
reason
i
say
that
is
because
the
secretary
has
broad
discretion
under
the
various
federal
reclamation
laws.
congress
has
given
him
discretion
to
sell
water.
congress
has
given
him
discretion
to
get
money
from
people
who
purchase
the
water.
if
that
discretion
in
simply
selling
the
water
is
deemed
to
override
state
laws
that
might
otherwise
condition
to
sell
that
water,
then
section
8
is
nullity.
it
simply
does
not
exist
and
congress
has
constantly
reaffirmed
the
principle
of
state
control,
and
therefore,
we
do
not
believe
that
it
meant
to,
thus,
repeal
section
8
by
implication.
that
is
what
the
united
states
is
really
arguing
in
this
case.
it
is
arguing
that
section
8
has
been
repealed
by
implication.
in
our
view,
the
section
mandates
the
partnership
between
congress
and
the
states
and
under
that
partnership,
it
is
congress
and
not
the
states
which
set
the
basic
reclamation
policies
of
this
country,
but
within
that
framework,
the
states
are
free
to
act.
the
secretary
does
not
have
discretionary
authority
to
destroy
that
partnership
by
coming
in
and
overriding
a
state
law
that
maybe
fully
within
that
congressional
parameter.
the
result
which
we
are
suggesting
to
the
court
is
one
we
think
harmonizes
and
reconciles
the
various
reclamation
laws
that
have
been
established
by
congress.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
they
have
not
really
existed
in
the
past
too
much
because
there
has
been
a
great
accommodation
between
federal
and
state
agencies
of
california.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
i
am
not
sure
there
are
such
possible
conflicts.
i
think
this
case
raises
the
question
whether
the
states
have
the
right
to
impose
any
kind
of
conditions
on
the
federal
water
right
regardless
of
whether
those
conditions
may
or
may
not
impair
to
congressional
policy.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
that
is
right.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
ultimately,
that
question
would
have
to
be
answered
by
the
courts.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
i
do
not
think
there
would
always
be
litigation.
in
fact,
as
i
said,
the
case
comes
to
this
court
on
the
bare
legal
question
whether
the
states
have
the
right
to
impose
any
kind
of
conditions
under
any
circumstances.
once
that
question
is
established,
i
do
not
think
the
federal
government
and
the
western
states
are
going
to
be
running
to
the
court
all
the
time
to
determine
whether
a
particular
condition
or
conditions
are
consistent
with
congressional
policy.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
that
is
for
sure.
yes,
the
potential
is
there,
justice
stevens.
i
cannot
ignore
that.
we
are
not
asking
the
court
to
adapt
an
easy
view.
if
the
court
wants
to
adapt
the
easy
view,
then
obviously,
it
ought
to
uphold
the
position
of
the
united
states,
but
because
there
is
no
conflict
under
the
united
states’
view,
all
conflicts
would
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
secretary’s
discretionary
authority.
the
states
would
not
have
control
at
all.
but
we
think
that
section
8
imposes
upon
this
court
an
obligation
to
examine
such
potential
conflicts
as
may
exist,
section
8
can
be
read
in
no
other
way.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
we
think
that
they
would
be
required
to
pursue
california’s
mandamus
remedies.
in
the
other
words,
i
would
say
the
federal
government
would
be
required
to
seek
direct
judicial
review
of
those
particular
conditions.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
we
think
that
the
suit
in
the
first
instance
ought
to
be
brought
in
the
state
court.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
i
was
just
going
to
say
that,
certainly,
there
would
be
no
problem
with
the
united
states
removing
such
a
case
to
the
federal
courts.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
pardon
me?
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
or
starting
in
the
federal
court.
that
raises
the
question
whether
the
united
states
would
be
required
to
pursue
its
state
judicial
remedies
as
well
as
comply
with
state
administrative
procedures.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
thank
you.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
the
united
states
makes
the
suggestion
that
there
is
no
issue
before
this
court
whether
the
federal
government
must
in
fact
acquire
appropriative
permits
under
california
law.
i
would
respond
to
that
simply
that
the
united
states
itself
raised
that
very
question
in
this
litigation,
in
its
prayer
of
relief
and
its
complaint
for
declaratory
judgment
and
that
appears
at
appendix
one,
page
19.
the
lower
court,
responding
to
the
united
states’
argument,
resolved
the
issue
against
the
united
states.
the
united
states
is
arguing
that
the
court
should
not
consider
the
question
here.
we
think
that
would
be
an
inappropriate
way
to
resolve
and
pass
up
on
the
lower
decision
in
this
case.
the
united
states
also
has
discussed
at
some
length
the
various
conditions
which
were
actually
imposed
upon
the
bureau
of
reclamation
in
decision
1422.
i
caution
the
court
that
there
is
much
more
at
stake
in
this
case
than
decision
1422.
there
are,
in
fact,
a
total
of
12
decisions
issued
by
california’s
water
resources
control
board
that
impose
conditions
upon
the
bureau
of
reclamation.
if
united
states’
claim
is
upheld
in
this
case,
then
presumably
the
conditions
in
all
12
of
those
decisions
are
invalid,
not
just
the
conditions
in
decision
1422.
the
lower
court
did
not
actually
evaluate
the
conditions
that
are
involved
in
decision
1422.
thus,
we
do
not
think
there
is
any
kind
of
adequate
record
for
the
court
to
examine
that
question
here.
if
the
court
wants
to
consider
that
question,
it
should
either
decide
that
the
matter
has
been
resolved
against
the
united
states
or
must
be
resolved
against
the
united
states
because
it
did
not
seek
direct
judicial
review
of
the
conditions,
and
therefore,
is
barred
by
the
doctrine
of
resu
dicta
or
alternatively,
should
remand
the
case
to
the
lower
court
so
that
it
can
itself
consider
the
validity
of
those
conditions.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
no,
not
at
all,
justice
white.
arizona
involved
a
very
peculiar
situation
that
arose
under
the
boulder
canyon
project
act.
the
court,
in
that
case
construed
the
meaning
of
the
boulder
canyon
project
act
which
of
course
involved
a
reclamation
project
that
utilized
the
waters
of
many
different
states.
the
court
held
that
the
legislative
history
showed
that
the
federal
government
under
that
act
was
to
have
absolute
control
of
water
and
that
any
other
system
would
not
work
because
otherwise
the
project
would
be
subject
to
the
various
and
even
inconsistent
commands
of
different
state
legislatures,
but
the
reclamation
act
of
1902
has
an
entirely
different
legislative
history.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
in
ivanhoe
and
fresno,
the
court,
as
we
view
the
court’s
decisions,
merely
held
that
states
could
not
override
specific
congressional
policies
that
had
been
established
by
congress
either
in
the
reclamation
act
of
1902
or
in
later
acts.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
there
was
some
certain
language
that
appeared
in
those
decisions
that
was
strictly
dictum,
justice
white.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
if
that
dictum
is
construed
against
the
position
we
are
advocating,
we
certainly
disagree
with
it.
it
is
possible,
however,
to
construe
that
language
only
as
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
the
states
have
no
right
to
exercise
any
veto
power
over
federal
projects.
if
that
is
the
way
you
construe
the
language,
then
it
is
okay.
if
it
is
construed
more
broadly,
as
united
states
would
construe
it,
then
we
think
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
legislative
history
of
the
reclamation
act
of
1902
and
thus
is
wrong.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes,
it
was.
i
do
not
want
to
discuss
the
conditions
at
length,
but
i
do
think
that
i
should
note
to
the
court
that
what
the
united
states'
argument
before
the
court
today
is
somewhat
different
from
representations
that
is
already
made
to
this
court
with
respect
to
the
effect
o
the
terms
and
conditions
of
decision
1422.
the
united
states,
in
fact,
advised
this
court
in
another
case
that
with
respect
to
those
conditions
its
only
effect,
that
is
decision
1422’s
only
effect,
would
be
to
diverse
slightly
the
beneficial
use
of
the
full
conservation
yield
of
the
project.
most
of
the
project
purposes
were
permitted
by
the
board’s
decision.
the
decision
does
not
render
the
project
useless
or
fundamentally
alter
its
value.
actually,
if
you
examine
the
conditions
themselves,
you
find
that
the
united
states’
former
statement
was
quite
true.
in
fact,
california
provided,
we
think,
a
very
balanced
response
in
decision
1422
to
a
situation
that
congress
completely
overlooked
and
could
not
have
foreseen
when
it
authorized
the
new
melones
project.
specifically,
congress,
when
it
authorized
that
project
intended
for
the
waters
to
be
used
n
a
particular
unit
of
the
central
valley
project
known
as
the
east
side
division,
and
congress
later
abandoned
plans
for
that
project.
the
bureau
of
reclamation
has
not
developed
any
kind
of
alternative
plans
for
that
water.
so
all
the
state
board
did
was
this.
it
simply
deferred
the
bureau’s
right
to
full
impoundment
of
water
until
the
bureau
came
up
with
a
plan
and
submitted
the
plan
to
the
state
board
for
its
approval.
we
think
this
is
a
very
modest
exercise
of
the
right
which
the
states
have
been
given
by
congress
under
section
8.
the
united
states,
in
arguing
that
the
states
do
not
even
have
this
right
or
essentially
asking
this
court
to
abrogate
a
fundamental
and
historic
principle
of
the
federal
reclamation
laws.
that
principle,
which
has
always
been
observed
in
actual
historical
practice,
is
that
the
states
have
an
essential
basic
right
to
control
how
water
is
used
under
the
reclamation
act
of
1902.
the
united
states
in
the
final
analysis
is
asking
this
court
to
give
it
powers
that
it
has
never
got
from
congress.
we
recommend
that
the
appropriate
solution
for
the
united
states
is
to
go
to
congress
and
not
to
come
to
this
court
if
it
wants
to
overturn
that
principle.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
that
is
correct.
in
fact,
congress
specifically
amended
section
8
during
the
course
of
its
passage
of
section
8
during
the
1902
reclamation
act
to
specifically
provide
for
that
problem.
the
appearance
for
the
final
solution
appears
and
it
is
explained
fully
in
our
brief,
justice
stewart.
