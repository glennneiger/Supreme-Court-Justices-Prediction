justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
the
phrase
“congressional
authorized
purpose
of
the
project”
one
gotten
out
of
the
legal
literature
or
used
by
the
state
of
california
or
by
the
united
states?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
congress
said
“we
want
to
have
the
new
melones
project
and
we
are
going
to
appropriate
all
vested
water
rights
in
the
state
of
california
that
are
inconsistent
with
the
operation
of
that.”
would
you
think
congress
could
do
that
if
it
simply
set
it
forth
in
the
authorization
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
consistently
with
the
gerlach
live
stock
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
power
do
you
suppose
it
would
be
exercising
if
it
did
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
subsequent
cases
have
suggested
that
it
does
have
that
power?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
vested
water
rights?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
they
simply
say
“they
are
now
ours”
without
condemning
them?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
cases
ever
relied
on
the
commerce
clause
to
support
the
taking
by
the
united
states
of
unappropriated
water
in
a
situation
that
did
not
involve
a
navigational
servitude
as
well?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
cannot
either.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
this
was
all
apparent
to
congressman
mondell
in
1902?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
what
basis
do
you
give
that
answer
to
that
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
i
understand
the
general
welfare
clause,
as
interpreted
in
the
united
states
v.
butler,
it
was
said
that
he
it
gave
congress
a
power
to
tax
and
spend
for
the
general
welfare
without
being
required
to
refine
further
authority
under
the
commerce
clause
or
some
other
affirmative
grant
of
power,
but
do
you
concede
what
justice
white’s
hypothetical
poses
to
you,
it
is
simply
being
an
exercise
of
a
power
to
spend?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
justice
white’s
question
did
pose
to
you
a
conflict,
i
would
think,
where
there
the
federal
government
comes
in
and
says
“we
want
to
use
this
water
for
our
irrigation,”
and
the
state
law
says
“domestic
use
has
priority,”
and
the
water
appropriation
board
says
“we
have
18
applicants
for
domestic
use
who
can
only
be
partially
satisfied.”
you
say,
nonetheless,
the
government’s
claim
must
prevail
for
irrigation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
that
section
8
is
an
implied
circumscription
of
the
secretary’s
authority?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
court
of
appeals
came
out
about
100%
opposite
from
this
court
in
hancock
v.
train,
did
it
not?
the
court
of
appeals,
in
this
case,
said
you
have
to
go
through
the
forum,
but
you
do
not
have
to
follow
the
substance
and
this
court,
in
hancock
v.
train,
said
you
do
not
have
to
go
through
the
form
but
you
do
have
to
follow
the
substance?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
barnett,
is
it
the
government’s
position
that
it
will
own
the
2.5
million
square-feet
of
water
that
is
stored
behind
the
dam?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
never
answered.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
could,
for
instance,
decide
that
that
water
should
be
used
for
irrigation
and
sell
it
to
people
who
wanted
to
use
it
for
irrigation
even
though,
under
california
law,
domestic
use
took
higher
priority
and
if
that
law
prevailed,
they
could
not
use
it
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yet,
it
is
appropriated,
you
say,
it
is
not
bought,
it
is
not
condemned?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
it
was
not
owned
and,
yet,
it
is
simply
somehow
transmogrified
by
the
existence
of
this
project
into
something
that
is
made
available
to
people
in
california
under
a
system
of
law
that
is
not
consistent
with
california’s?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
power
is
it
acting
under
when
it
does
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
has
not
spent
any
money
buying
these
water
rights
though.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
take
the
example
of
california
homesteading
project.
supposing
it
builds
a
big
dam
right
in
the
midst
of
california
state
forest
and
says
“we
need
the
land
from
the
state
forest
to
carry
out
the
purpose
of
the
dam.”
do
you
think
it
could
just
take
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
you
will
enter
with
third
parties
for
their
actual
use?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
that,
because
of
congress?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
california
legislature
were
to
next
week
to
pass
a
law
declaring
that
all
unappropriated
water
in
the
state
is
hereby
appropriated
to
beneficial
users
who
will
be
determined
by
a
commission
appointed
by
the
governor
on
the
basis
of
existing
california
water
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
is
no
question
that
massachusetts
owns
the
unappropriated
waters
in
its
streams,
is
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
the
160-acre
limitation
written
in
by
congress
under
the
1902
reclamation
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
granted
certiorari
in
these
two
cases
to
consider
important
questions
of
federal
state
relations
in
the
field
of
water
law,
an
area
of
the
law
which
is
of
more
than
merely
academic
interest
of
the
people
of
the
arid
and
semi-arid
western
part
of
this
country.
in
california
against
the
united
states,
united
states
government
sought
to
impound
about
two-and-a-half
million
acre
feet
of
water
from
california's
stanislaus
river
as
part
of
its
central
valley
reclamation
project.
the
california
state
water
resources
control
board,
an
institution
in
the
city
of
california
ruled
that
under
state
water
law,
the
water
could
not
be
allocated
to
united
states
unless
it
agreed
to
various
conditions
dealing
with
the
water's
use.
the
united
states
there
upon
brought
suit
in
the
federal
district
court
in
sacramento
seeking
a
declaratory
judgment
that
it
need
not
comply
with
state
water
law.
the
district
court
held
that
while
the
united
states
must
have
apply
to
the
state
for
appropriation
permit.
california
had
the
issue
to
permit
without
condition,
if
there
was
sufficient
unappropriated
water.
in
the
state
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
which
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
reverse.
section
8
of
the
reclamation
act
of
1902
provides
that
nothing
in
the
act
should
be
construed
as
affecting
or
intended
to
affect
or
to
in
any
way
interfere
with
the
laws
of
any
states
relating
to
the
controlled
appropriation
use
or
distribution
of
water
and
the
section
instructs
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
proceed
in
conformity
with
such
laws
in
constructing
reclamation
projects.
the
legislative
history
of
the
reclamation
act
of
1902,
indeed
the
entire
history
of
congressional
legislation
in
the
field
of
federal
water
law,
clearly
demonstrates
that
congress
intended
to
differ
to
state
law
and
the
appropriation
and
distribution
of
water
impounded
by
federal
reclamations
projects.
california
can
impose
any
condition
on
the
appropriation
permits
granted
to
the
united
states,
that
is
not
inconsistent
with
congressional
directives.
we
disallow
any
statements
in
our
earlier
cases
that
might
be
read
to
the
contrary.
mr.
justice
white
joined
by
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
the
california
case.
