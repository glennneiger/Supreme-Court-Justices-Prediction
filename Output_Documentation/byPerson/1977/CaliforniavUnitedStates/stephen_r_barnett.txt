mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court.
i
do
not
think
that
is
the
case,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
do
not
agree
with
mr.
walston
that
if
the
court
holds
for
the
united
states
in
this
case
that
means
that
the
united
states
sweeps
the
field
and
that
the
states
are
completely
excluded
from
any
role
in
the
planning
of
reclamation
projects
or
in
the
formulation
of
reclamation
policy.
on
the
contrary,
we
submit
that
there
is
and
always
has
been
a
coordination
and
a
consultation
between
the
states
and
the
federal
government
and
that
that
is
illustrated
by
this
very
case.
indeed,
there
are
aspects
of
this
case
which
demonstrate
that
what
the
state
of
california
was
trying
to
do
here
is
to
upset
and
override
at
least
one
accommodation
that
had
been
reached
with
respect
to
the
new
melones
project
and
if
you
will,
i
will
get
to
that
in
time.
i
am
referring
to
the
water
quality
agreement
which
was
an
actual
memorandum
of
agreement
made
between
the
united
states
bureau
of
reclamation
and
the
california
central
valley
regional
water
quality
control
board
with
respect
to
water
quality
functions
of
the
new
melones
dam.
what
the
state
board
has
done
in
decision
1422,
as
i
will
elaborate
in
more
detail
perhaps
later,
is
they
simply
override
that
agreement,
unilaterally
rewrite
it.
thus,
we
would
submit
that
what
the
state
is
trying
to
do
here
is
to
change
the
rules.
it
is
the
state
and
not
the
federal
government
which
is
trying
to
change
the
rules
that
have
existed
for
the
past
70-add
years
and
that
have
an
honor
to
a
rough
accommodation
of
the
conflicting
state
and
federal
interest
in
this
area.
it
is
the
united
states’
submission,
of
course,
that
all
four
of
the
judges
who
ruled
on
this
case
in
the
courts
below
were
correct
that
section
8
of
the
reclamation
act
of
1902
does
not
authorize
a
state
to
impose
conditions
on
a
federal
reclamation
project
such
as
the
25
conditions
that
were
imposed
here.
on
the
point
on
which
the
two
courts
below
differed,
we
do
not
here
challenge
the
ruling
of
the
court
of
appeals.
that
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
that
the
united
states
is
required
by
section
8
to
file
applications
with
the
state
board
for
permits
to
appropriate
the
water
it
needs
for
it
reclamation
projects.
we
had
contended,
as
mr.
walston
said
in
the
district
court,
that
we
are
not
by
law
to
do
that,
that
we
simply
do
it
as
a
matter
of
comity.
we
have,
in
either
event,
always
done
it.
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
that
we
are
required
by
law
to
do
it
and
as
we
state
in
our
brief,
we
do
not
contest
that
ruling
here.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
there
is
an
apparent
anomaly,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
but
in
any
event,
we
do
not
think
it
makes
any
difference
here
since
we
did
in
this
case
apply
to
the
state
board
for
our
permits.
since
it
is
our
policy
to
do
so,
we
do
not
contest
the
ruling
that
we
are
required
to
do
so.
if
a
case
were
to
arise
where
the
state
took
such
a
position
that
we
felt
that
we
could
not
do
so,
that
would
be
the
case
on
that
record
in
which
the
court
should
decide
whether
we
are
indeed
required
to
do
so.
mr.
walston
has
said
little,
indeed
nothing
in
his
argument
and
little
in
his
briefs,
about
the
25
conditions
that
were
imposed
here
by
the
state
board
on
the
new
melones
project.
we
feel
it
necessary
to
look
with
some
detail
at
those
conditions
because,
as
mr.
justice
stevens
suggested,
it
may
seem
fine
in
the
abstract
to
argue
as
mr.
walston
has,
that
the
congress
can
make
the
policy
and
the
states
may
fill
the
gaps.
it
may
not
be
so
easy
in
practice,
in
reality
when
you
are
building
a
dam
and
we
submit
that
the
facts
of
this
project
illustrate
that
difficulty
and
illustrate,
just
as
mr.
justice
stevens
suggested,
that
there
would
be
a
lot
of
court
cases
on
precisely
such
issues
as
whether
four
or
ten
conditions
were
not
consistent
with
what
petitioners
refer
to
as
the
specific
or
the
basic
congressional
policies
behind
a
project.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
we
took
the
position
in
both
courts
that
the
state
had
no
right
to
impose
any
conditions.
it
was
petitioners,
the
state
of
california,
who
moved
for
summary
judgment
in
the
district
court
and
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
in
our
favor.
we
did
not
move
for
summary
judgment.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
for
two
reasons,
one
is
that
the
court
might
not
agree
with
us
and
we
might
therefore
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
the
other
reason
is
that
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
conditions
to
show
why
the
state
should
have
no
power
to
impose
any
of
them.
it
is
only
by
getting
down
into
the
dirt
so
to
speak
and
looking
at
the
nitty-gritty
details
that
one
sees
what
would
be
involved
in
the
legal
conclusion
that
petitioners
are
asserting.
we
think
it
is
necessary
to
look
at
the
conditions
in
order
to
see
just
what
the
difficulties
would
be
that
would
arise.
first
of
all,
as
mr.
walston
had
stated,
the
new
melones
dam
is
a
project
that
was
authorized
first
by
congress
in
1944
and
reauthorized
in
1962.
the
project,
as
reauthorized,
calls
for
a
dam
with
a
reservoir
having
a
storage
capacity
of
2.4-million
acre-feet.
this
is
on
the
stanislaus
river
in
california,
of
course.
the
project,
as
authorized
in
1962
tentatively,
called
for
a
hydroelectric
power
plant
with
a
capacity
of
150,000
kilowatts.
that
was
stated
as
tentative
and
as
a
result
of
subsequent
consultations
between
the
federal
power
commission
and
the
bureau
of
reclamation,
it
was
decided
to
raise
the
power
capacity
and
it
was
raised
to
300,000
kilowatts.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
that
it
will
own
the
water,
no
that
is
not
our
position.
that
raises
the
question
which
was
mooted
with
mr.
walston
and
which
the
court
has
really
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
it
has
never
answered
the
question
of
who
owns
unappropriated
water.
now,
here
the
water
would
have
been
appropriated
by
the
government,
but
i
would
say,
we
would
still
not
claim
that
we
own
it.
we
would
be,
in
essence
i
think
trustees
for
the
people
to
whom
we
would
sell
the
water
or
contract
for
the
water
pursuant
to
the
congressional
legislation.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
that
would
be
our
position,
but
that
is
not
because
we
own
the
water.
it
is
because
congress,
in
the
act,
has
authorized
us
to
build
the
dam
and
appropriate
the
water
for
the
purpose
of
irrigation,
among
others.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
no,
because
it
was
not
owned.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
that
is
true
and
that
system
of
law
arises,
the
law
of
this
project
arises
from
the
acts
of
congress
authorizing
the
project.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
congress
would
pay
just
compensation
for
those?
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
unappropriated
waters?
i
would
think
congress
could
do
that
constitutionally,
yes.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
yes,
i
think
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
i
think
it
is
clear
from
cases
like
ivanhoe
that
the
power
to
spend
for
the
general
welfare
and
the
property
clause
are
two
powers.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
it
is
not
buying
the
water
rights,
but
it
is
buying
the
dam.
it
is
spending
money
on
the
dam.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
it
may
have
to
pay
for
it,
but
here
we
have
got
unappropriated
water
which
is
not
owned.
this
is
the
basic
question
that
the
court
had
never
decided,
the
ownership
of
unappropriated
water.
the
court
has
avoided
the
question
in
nebraska
v.
wyoming
and
ivanhoe
and
it
is
one
of
those
very
basic,
very
controversial
questions
that
we
think
are
best
avoided.
we
contend
here
that
when
congress
authorizes
a
reclamation
project,
the
effect
of
that
authorization
is
to
assert
a
federal
claim
to
the
water
that
is
needed
for
that
project.
now,
to
the
extent
that
water
has
already
been
appropriated,
the
federal
government
has
to
pay
for
it.
to
the
extent
that
that
water
is
unappropriated,
we
say
that
congress
has
authorized
a
federal
claim
which
the
states
must
accede
to
and
thereby,
must
grant
this
federal
government
a
permit
for
the
unappropriated
water
if
it
is
available.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
yes,
depending
on
the
purposes
of
the
particular
authorizing
act.
in
this
case,
the
purposes
of
the
particular
authorizing
act
are
clearly
that
the
water
be
turned
over
to
third
parties,
except
to
the
extent
that
it
is
to
be
used
for
recreation
and
the
reservoir,
for
example.
indeed
the
purposes
of
the
act,
and
what
i
would
now
like
to
mention
because
it
is
with
them
that
the
particular
conditions
have
to
be
compared.
petitioners
here
concede
that
the
authorizing
act
of
this
project
had
eight
purposes:
flood
control,
agricultural
use
of
the
water
that
is
irrigation,
municipal
use,
and
industrial
use.
those
are
four,
then
fish
and
wildlife
protection,
water
quality
control,
power
generation,
and
recreation.
pursuant
to
the
acts
authorizing
the
project,
the
united
states
duly
applied
to
the
state
water
resources
control
board
for
permits
authorizing
it
to
appropriate
the
water
needed
for
the
project.
the
united
states
filed
four
such
applications,
two
of
which
were
applications
for
transfers
of
applications
previously
filed
by
a
state
board.
in
brief
and
rubbing
out
some
of
the
details,
what
the
united
states
asked
for
in
these
applications
was
the
following.
it
asked
for
the
a
permit
to
store
2.4
million
acre-feet
annually,
which
would
be
in
the
reservoir
behind
the
dam
and
it
asked
for
the
right
to
divert
from
the
river
8,000
cubic-feet
per
second.
both
of
these
requests
were
for
all
eight
of
the
project
purposes,
although,
i
am
over
simplifying
somewhat.
now,
with
respect
to
the
purposes,
there
is
a
distinction
that
has
to
be
born
in
mind
and
that
is
between
instream
and
consumptive
uses
of
the
water.
for
example,
when
it
sought
to
divert
water
for
the
purposes
of
fish
culture
or
downstream
recreation
or
water
quality
control,
for
those
purposes
the
water
is
released
back
into
the
river.
it
is
stored
up
in
the
spring
when
the
water
is
high
and
then
released
in
the
summer
when
the
river
is
low
for
water
quality
control
or
for
fish
or
whatever.
those,
thus,
are
instream
uses,
to
be
distinguished
are
consumptive
uses,
whereby,
the
water
does
not
go
back
into
the
stream
and
the
consumptive
uses
are
agricultural
use
that
is
irrigation
or
municipal
or
industrial
consumption
of
the
water.
the
other
of
the
eight
uses,
that
is
the
use
for
power,
is
really
an
instream
use.
the
water
is
diverted
only
momentarily
through
the
penstocks
of
the
hydroelectric
plant
and
then
goes
into
the
stream.
now,
to
look
at
the
conditions,
the
25
conditions
that
the
state
board
imposed
in
granting
these
permits
and
i
of
course
do
not
propose
to
discuss
all
25
of
them.
we
have
discussed
most
of
them
in
our
brief.
i
propose,
here,
to
focus
only
on
two
or
three
of
the
most
important.
in
its
decision,
and
this
is
at
page
31
of
volume
2
of
the
appendix,
the
state
board
found
there
is
unappropriated
water
available
to
satisfy
the
demands
of
the
project
as
proposed.
but
nonetheless,
the
state
board
did
not
proceed
to
grant
the
permits
for
that
unappropriated
water
that
the
united
states
was
seeking,
rather
it
imposed
these
25
conditions.
conditions
one
and
two
are
the
most
important.
they
respond
directly
to
the
amounts
of
water
that
the
united
states
was
seeking.
they
substantially
deny
those
amounts
despite
the
board’s
finding
that
sufficient
unappropriated
water
is
available.
again,
to
oversimplify
somewhat
what
condition
one
does
is
that
it
grants
permits
for
water,
but
only
for
certain
purposes,
not
for
other
purposes
that
were
authorized
in
the
act.
in
brief,
it
grants
permits
for
the
instream
purposes,
but
it
denies
the
united
states
the
right
to
store
or
divert
water
for
the
consumptive
purposes
of
irrigational
use
or
municipal
or
industrial
consumption.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
they
give
their
reasons,
mr.
justice
white,
in
their
opinion.
their
reasons
are
that,
for
example
at
page
23
of
the
opinion
they
say,
the
project’s
recreational
features
would
not
adequately
substitute
for
the
present
recreational
uses
of
the
river
in
the
upstream
reach,
that
is,
they
want
to
preserve
the
present
white
water
rafting.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
that,
in
fact,
is
a
reason
that
petitioners
come
up
within
their
briefs.
the
board,
at
no
place,
made
that
argument.
that
is
an
argument
that
the
board’s
counsel
have
made
on
appeal.
the
board
did
not
say
anything
about
congress
having
failed
to
appropriate
money
for
the
east
side
division.
the
board
did
say,
i
should
say,
that
the
secretary
does
not
have
a
plan
for
the
use
of
the
water.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
and
it
was
on
that
basis
that
they
say
“since
he
does
not
have
a
plan
for
consumptive
use
of
the
water,
we
will
not
allow
any
water
for
consumptive
use
especially
since
if
we
allow
the
water
for
consumptive
use
that
would
fill
the
reservoir
and
that
would
wipe
out
the
white
water
rafting.”
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
there
are
several
things
wrong
with
that
reason.
one
is
that
the
secretary,
in
fact,
does
have
a
plan.
the
act
provides
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
even
if
he
did
not,
we
would
submit
that
it
is
not
up
to
the
state
board
to
trench
on
the
authority
that
congress
has
given
the
secretary.
if
it
were
true
that,
as
mr.
walston
suggested
at
one
point
that
the
secretary
is
acting
beyond
his
congressional
authority,
the
remedy
for
that
is
not
to
go
to
the
state
board.
the
remedy
for
that
would
be
to
go
to
federal
court.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
perhaps
it
would
not
be,
but
the
board
here
has
not
taken
the
position
that
the
secretary
was
acting
beyond
his
congressional
authority.
they
say
that
he
does
not
have
a
plan
for
the
use
of
the
water.
there
is
nothing
in
the
act
that
requires
him
to
have
a
plan
before
he
gets
the
water.
it
has
traditionally
been
the
secretary’s
practice
to
build
a
reservoir
first
and
then
make
the
contracts
for
the
water,
rather
than
vice
versa.
indeed,
here,
the
secretary
has
various
plans.
the
problem
is
that
the
act
provides
that
the
secretary
must
first
determine
the
water
needs
of
the
stanislaus
river
basin
before
he
can
use
the
water
for
consumptive
uses
outside
the
basin.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
that
is
what
the
act
says,
the
1962
act,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
the
secretary
is,
right
now,
in
the
process,
has
right
now
on
his
desk
as
it
were,
recommendations
as
to
how
to
define
the
stanislaus
river
basin.
once
he
defines
the
basin,
he
will
determine
the
needs
of
the
basin
and
then
he
will
determine
how
much
water
can
be
sold
outside
the
basin.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
congress
authorized,
on
the
basis
of
the
project
document,
a
reservoir
of
2.4
million
acre-feet
on
the
basis
of
projected
needs,
both
within
the
basin
and
outside
of
it
on
the
basis
of
projected
needs.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
no,
congress
has
appropriated
the
money
for
the
dam.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
that
is
the
east
side
division
that
they
refer
to
in
their
brief.
it
was
not
brought
up
by
the
board.
it
is
not
the
case,
as
petitioners
claim,
that
the
new
melones
dam
was
authorized
only
in
connection
with
the
east
side
division.
the
east
side
division,
incidentally
is
a
canal,
a
proposed
canal
to
bring
water
southward
to
the
east
side
of
the
san
joaquin
valley.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
that
would
bring
water
outside
the
stanislaus
river
basin,
that
is
true,
but
that
was
only
one
contemplated
way
of
bringing
water
outside
the
stanislaus
river
basin
to
the
service
areas
of
the
central
valley
project.
there
were
and
are
many
others.
the
board
is
considering
many
others.
indeed,
at
the
beginning
of
decision
1422,
this
is
at
page
19
of
volume
2
of
the
appendix,
the
board
itself
states,
the
bureau
has
described
the
following
areas
within
which
the
conservation
yield
of
the
new
melones
project
may
be
used
for
irrigation
or
for
other
consumptive
purposes,
the
local
service
area
consisting
of
tuolumne,
calaveras,
san
joaquin,
and
stanislaus
counties.
southern
san
joaquin
valley
via
the
proposed
east
side
canal
or
a
cross
valley
canal,
the
san
felipe
division
of
the
central
valley
project,
the
san
luis
unit
of
the
central
valley
project,
the
area
served
by
the
delta-mendota
canal,
the
monta
zuma
hills
unit
of
the
central
valley
project,
and
the
suisun
moshe
area.
so
it
is
not
at
all
the
case
that
simply
because
it
may
have
been
decided
not
to
build
the
east
side
division
and
indeed,
that
decision
was
not
made
by
congress,
that
proposal
never
got
to
congress
as
i
understand
it
because
the
state
of
california
did
not
endorse
it,
but
it
is
not
the
case
that
simply
because
that
particular
proposal
may
have
fallen
through
there
are
no
uses
for
this
water
outside
the
stanislaus
river
basin.
if
i
may
return
to
these
conditions
which
i
think
are
the
heart
of
the
case,
as
i
was
saying,
condition
one
simply
prohibits
the
federal
bureau
from
diverting
or
storing
water
for
the
consumptive
purposes
that
were
among
the
purposes
of
the
act,
that
is,
for
irrigation
or
domestic
or
municipal
or
industrial
consumption.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
but
the
secretary
is
in
the
process
of
deciding
them
after
he
defines
the
need
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
further,
the
condition
one
by
limiting
the
size
of
the
reservoir
because
the
water
cannot
be
stored
for
consumptive
purposes,
the
size
of
the
reservoir
would
be
only
1.1
million
acre-feet,
not
2.4
million,
there
is
a
tremendous
impact
on
the
power
that
can
be
generated
by
the
project
and
power
is
also
one
of
the
admitted
purposes
of
the
act.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
that
is
true,
but
it
seems
unlikely
in
california
or
in
the
country
that
there
will
be
a
lack
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
the
act
says
that
the
secretary
is
to
determine
the
needs
of
the
basin
and
then
to
determine
where
to
sell
the
water.
if
california
is
trying
to
tell
him
he
has
to
decide
where
to
sell
the
water
before
he
determines
the
needs
of
the
basin,
then
california
is
going
against
the
act.
in
addition,
it
must
be
recognized
as
i
know
at
the
outset
that
the
state
of
california
has
been
in
on
the
planning
of
this
project
all
along.
they
endorsed
it
initially
before
congress
in
1962.
this
project
has
been
no
secret
to
the
state.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
yes?
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
as
i
said
before,
i
think
what
these
conditions
provide
is
relevant
to
see
why
it
should
be
the
law
that
california
has
no
authority
to
impose
any
conditions.
in
addition,
it
is
possible
that
the
court
would
want
to
look
at
the
conditions
individually
and
decide
that
some
of
them
are
acceptable
and
some
of
them
are
not.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
as
i
said
at
the
outset,
we
do
not
contest
that
in
this
case.
we
agree
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
because
the
court
of
appeals
so
ruled,
because
we
make
it
a
practice
to
seek
such
a
permit
because
it
serves
legitimate
federalism
functions
of
informing
the
state
of
what
we
are
doing.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
as
a
matter
of
power,
for
purposes
of
this
case,
we
concede
that
we
are
compelled
to.
if
another
case
came
up
where
we
thought
that
being
compelled
to
was
unacceptable
to
the
federal
policy
involved,
we
would
want
to
reserve
the
right
on
those
facts
to
contest
the
issue.
we
do
not
contest
that
here.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
yes
and
the
board
so
determined
here,
as
i
read,
that
there
is
sufficient
unappropriated
water.
i
might
mention
that
it
is
not
all
the
conditions
here
that
we
would
contest.
in
so
far
as
conditions
are
concerned
with
whether
unappropriated
water
is
available,
we
do
not
contest
those
conditions.
for
example,
in
this
case,
there
are
two
conditions:
14
and
19,
which
we
would
not
contest.
condition
14
says
that
the
bureau
of
reclamation
does
not
authorize
to
collect
water
outside
of
the
specified
seasons.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
i
think
that
is
correct.
that
is
the
way
we
read
the
legislation.
we
accept
their
conditions
in
so
far
as
they
relate
to
the
availability
of
unappropriated
water.
we
do
not
accept
their
conditions
in
so
far
as
they
would
trench
on
the
operation
or
the
structure
even
of
the
federal
project.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
that
sounds
as
though
that
might
pose
the
question
that
this
court
has
avoided
deciding
since
the
dessert
land
act
of
1877,
that
is,
whether
by
that
act
the
federal
government
did
give
ownership
of
all
unappropriated
water
to
the
states
or
not.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
massachusetts
has
a
riparian
rights
doctrine
and
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
i
think
it
is
a
stream
of
federal
legislation
beginning
with
the
mining
act
of
1966,
including
the
dessert
land
act
of
1877
and
including
the
reclamation
act
of
1902.
as
we
read
the
act,
the
language
that
mr.
walston
was
relying
on
and
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
was
simply
designed
to
continue
that
tradition
of
making
clear
that
private
rights
to
water
on
public
land
could
be
established
by
the
state
doctrine
of
prior-appropriation.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
i
suppose
not,
and
i
simply
cannot
answer
the
question
as
to
who
owns
the
flowing
water
in
massachusetts,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
was
mentioning
power,
what
conditions
one
and
two
do
to
the
power
output.
in
the
record,
page
146
of
volume
2
of
the
appendix,
there
is
an
affidavit
by
jay
robert
hamin
(ph)
who
supervised
the
power
operations
of
the
central
valley
project.
as
he
points
out,
what
the
denial
of
the
full
water
rights
requested
would
mean
would
be
that
the
firm
capacity
of
the
new
melones
power
plant
would
be
reduced
to
zero,
that
is
firm
capacity
as
the
capacity
you
can
count
on
any
day.
during
the
summer
when
the
river
is
very
low,
you
need
water
in
your
reservoir
if
you
are
going
to
be
able
to
sell
power.
he
says
the
firm
capacity
would
be
reduced
to
zero.
the
average
kilowatts
put
out
per
year
would
be
reduced
from
430
million
to
192
million.
the
value
of
the
power
output
would,
thereby,
be
reduced
from
5.5
million
a
year
to
1.9
million
a
year.
he
says
this
amount
would
not
have
justified
the
power
plant
investment
in
the
first
place.
this
is
the
kind
of
question
that
arises,
mr.
justice
stevens.
petitioners
would
say
it
is
necessarily
inconsistent
with
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
no,
they
certainly
do
not
take
that
position.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
no,
i
think
we
could
ask
him,
but
i
think
they
would
take
the
position
that
since
congress
did
not
specifically
say
“we
want
$5
million
worth
of
power
a
year”
that
this
does
not
conflict
with
the
specific
congressional
purpose,
but
that
is
the
kind
of
argument
that
the
courts
would
be
in.
how
specific
does
congress
have
to
be?
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
i
do
not
think
so
because
congress,
one
of
the
specific
provisions
of
the
1962
authorizing
act
written
into
the
act
is
that
the
new
melones
project
shall
become
an
integral
part
of
the
central
valley
project
and
shall
be
operated
as
such
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
now,
condition
four
countermands
that.
condition
four
provides
that
no
consumptive
use
of
the
water
for
new
melones
may
be
made
outside
the
stanislaus
river
county
unless
it
is
demonstrated
that
no
other
central
valley
project
source
is
available
to
supply
water
to
those
particular
areas.
now,
we
would
submit
that
that
directly
contradicts
the
language
in
the
act
that
this
project
shall
be
integrated
with
the
central
valley
project.
petitioners
would
apparently
say
“that
does
not
specifically
contradict
it
for
some
reason
because
congress
did
not
specifically
say
something
about
it,”
but
we
find
it
to
be
another
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
if
congress
thought
that
the
total
project
had
enough
water
available,
it
would
not
authorize
this
project.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
what
the
1962
act
says
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
they
are
all
temporary
in
that
they
are
subject
to
further
order
of
the
board.
for
example,
condition
two
says
these
limitations
on
the
amount
of
water
that
may
be
diverted
and
impounded
are
subject
to
further
order
of
the
board
which
shall
be
preceded.
i
am
reading
from
page
34
of
volume
2
of
the
appendix.
such
further
order
shall
be
preceded
by
a
showing
that
the
benefits
that
will
accrue
from
a
specific
proposed
use
will
outweigh
any
damage
that
will
result
of
fish,
wildlife,
and
recreation
in
the
watershed
above
new
melones
dam
and
that
the
permit
he
has
firm
commitments
to
deliver
water
for
such
other
purposes.
the
federal
government
would
have
to
convince
the
state
board
that
the
benefits
of
the
use
of
this
additional
water
outweigh
the
damages,
as
the
board
sees
them,
to
the
fish,
wildlife,
and
recreation
in
the
watershed
before
this
addition
empowerment
would
be
allowed.
now,
we
submit
that
this
is
the
state
board
asserting
for
itself
the
power
to
determine
what
should
be
done
with
this
federal
project.
should
it
be
used
for
power
or
should
it
be
used
to
preserve
the
existing
white
water
above
the
dam
and
we
submit
that
that
is
clearly
inconsistent
with
the
federal
purposes
behind
this
project.
now,
they
would
say
“congress
did
not
say
in
the
act
that
power
is
more
important
than
white
water
rafting,”
therefore,
the
state
can
fill
in
the
gap.
they
talk
a
lot
in
their
replay
brief
about
how
it
has
to
be
a
specific
federal
policy
that
the
state
is
going
against.
page
58-59
of
their
reply
brief,
if
the
state
laws
do
not
contradict
the
specific
purposes
of
this
scheme
where
specific
elements
of
the
congressional
scheme
make
it
impossible
to
apply
the
principle,
with
specific
federal
policy
or
their
emphasis
incidentally.
we
submit
that
it
would
be
a
very
difficult,
if
not
impossible
thing
to
decide
when
it
is
a
specific
federal
policy
and
when
it
is
not.
further,
petitioners
apparently
take
the
position
that
congress,
to
be
sufficiently
specific,
has
to
say
it
in
the
statute.
congress
cannot
delegate
to
the
secretary
of
interior
any
administrative
authority
to
make
specific
decisions,
because
then
they
say
that
state
decisions
would
override.
we
say
that
that
is
why
this
whole
scheme
that
they
propose,
while
it
may
seem
fine
in
the
abstract,
when
you
apply
it
to
a
particular
decisions
of
a
particular
project,
it
simply
would
not
work
and
the
federal
courts,
as
you
suggested,
mr.
justice
stevens,
would
become
the
ultimate
arbiters
of
thus
is
a
particular
condition
inconsistent
or
not
with
a
federal
project?
i
would
submit
that
federal
judges,
even
judge
mcbride
in
sacramento
are
not
suited
to
be
the
chief
engineers
for
federal
reclamation
projects.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
this
dam
is
only
in
california.
this
river
is
only
in
california.
that
is
true.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
first
of
all,
it
gets
the
right
from
the
constitution,
as
has
been
held
in
ivanhoe
and
other
cases.
it
is
paying
for
the
dam.
in
addition,
it
had
the
state’s
cooperation.
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
we
have
the
official
statement
of
the
state
of
california
in
1962
endorsing
this
project.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
no,
i
think
section
8
of
the
1902
act
would
prevent
that
where
it
provides
that
nothing
in
the
act
can
impair
the
rights
of
another
state
or
an
interstate
river.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
i
do.
i
would
know
how
mr.
walston
mentioned
the
ivanhoe
decision
did
not
mention
it
at
all.
city
of
fresno
or
arizona
v.
california,
which
we,
of
course,
think
make
it
very
clear
that
this
question
has
been
decided.
in
city
of
fresno,
one
of
the
issues
was
whether
the
reclamation
project
water
had
to
be
delivered
in
accordance
with
california’s
county
of
origin
law,
the
very
law
that
is
involved
here
to
some
extent
and
the
court
ruled
“no,
it
did
not,”
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
did
not
have
to
follow
that
priority,
similarly
in
arizona
v.
california
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
the
reality
of
these
things,
mr.
justice
marshall,
is
these
projects
do
not
get
constructed
by
congress
unless
the
state
supports
them.
that
is
why
this
east
side
division
has
not
been
authorized,
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
we
contend
that
that
is
where
we
are
and
that
it
is
california
that
is
trying
to
upset
the
balance.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
when
we
disagree
about
the
operation
or
the
uses
of
a
federal
reclamation
project,
under
the
present
federal
reclamation
law,
yes,
that
is
our
position.
there
are,
of
course,
proposals
pending.
there
are
many
pending
proposals
for
changes
in
water
policy,
a
number
of
them,
indeed
there
are
some
on
the
president’s
desk
right
now,
as
i
understand
it,
a
number
of
them
provide
for
the
states
to
share
the
costs
with
the
federal
government
of
reclamation
projects.
under
that
kind
of
a
scheme,
you
might
have
a
very
different
system,
but
our
position
is
that,
under
the
present
law,
where
the
state
attempts
to
restrict
or
control
the
uses
and
operation
of
a
federal
project,
the
federal
government
must
prevail.
with
respect
to
the
state
federal
cooperation
aspect,
i
would
like
to
mention
also
what
i
mentioned
earlier,
condition
five
has
to
do
with
water
quality
control.
by
condition
five,
the
state
board
here
would
require
the
federal
government
to
release
certain
amounts
of
water
from
the
new
melones
dam
to
improve
the
quality
downstream.
the
federal
government,
in
1969,
made
an
agreement,
that
the
bureau
of
reclamation
entered
into
a
formal
agreement
which
appears
in
the
record
here,
whereby,
it
agreed
with
the
regional
water
quality
board
of
the
central
valley
to
release
certain
amounts
of
water
from
the
new
melones
dam
for
the
purposes
of
the
water
quality,
but
that
agreement
had
limitations.
the
bureau
said
it
could
not
release
more
than
70,000
acre-feet
a
year
and
if
conditions
were
bad,
it
would
have
to
limit
the
releases
to
the
irrigation
time
of
year.
what
the
board
has
done
here
in
condition
five
is
rewritten
that
condition,
rewritten
that
agreement,
requiring
the
federal
government
to
release
whatever
amounts
would
be
necessary
to
maintain
certain
concentrations
in
the
river
without
any
such
limitations.
thus,
this
is
an
example
of
how
you
have
existing
cooperation.
indeed,
in
this
case,
an
existing
formal
agreement
between
the
state
and
the
federal
government
which
the
california
state
board
here
is
purporting
to
override.
we,
thus,
submit
that
it
is
not
the
federal
government
here
which
is
against
cooperation
with
the
states.
the
whole
entire
scheme
of
the
reclamation
laws,
as
we
set
out
in
our
brief,
involve
state
participation.
it
is
the
state
here
which
is
trying
to
change
the
rules
by
asserting
these
unilateral
conditions.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
i
think
there
was
an
amendment
to
the
compliant.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
yes,
which
are
not
specifically
authorized.
if
they
are
not
specifically
authorized
by
federal
law
then,
we
submit
the
states
cannot
impose
them.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
we
would
submit
that
that
is
a
terrible
burden
to
impose
on
trial
judges.
it
is
not
just
this
project.
it
is
all
projects.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
it
might
be
easier
here
in
a
sense
that
we
have
tried
to
take
the
burden
that
the
trial
judge
did
not
take.
we
think
that
he
was
wise
in
declining
to
do
that
because
he
probably
saw
the
difficulties
that
would
entail.
notice,
further,
that
under
petitioner’s
theory
it
would
have
to
be
done
forever.
they
contend,
for
example,
you
cannot
decide
now
whether
some
of
these
conditions
are
inconsistent
with
federal
law.
you
have
to
wait
and
see
if
the
conditions
are
put
into
effect.
so
it
would
not
just
be
lots
of
conditions
as
to
each
reclamation
project,
but
it
would
be
a
continuing
series
of
operational
decisions
on
their
theory
with
respect
to
each
project,
all
of
which
would
be
brought
into
federal
court.
we
submit
that
because
of
the
difficulties
of
that
kind
of
a
process
that
those
difficulties
demonstrate
why
the
very
suggestion
is
unacceptable
and
why
the
law
should
remain,
as
this
court
has
held
in
its
well-known
section
8
cases,
that
the
states
cannot
impose
conditions
on
federal
projects.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
sit
down.
thank
you.
