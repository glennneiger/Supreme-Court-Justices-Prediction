we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
california
against
the
united

mr.
walston,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.

page
25
of
your
brief,
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
undertake
to
tell
me
what
you
think
the
senator
meant
precisely
by
that?
what
kind
of
condition
is
this?
is
he
talking
about
minnesota
where
we
have
a
surplus
of
water
as
compared
with
a
state
where
they
have
a
shortage
of
water,
or
just
what?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
differences
that
you
seem
to
be
emphasizing,
what
differences
can
you
suggest
he
was
talking
about?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
would
be
applicable
in
one
locality
totally
and
absolutely
is
inapplicable
in
another?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
might
be
comparing
montana
or
wyoming
with
california.
is
that
what
you
have
in
mind?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
walston.
mr.
barnett.
if
you
could,
mr.
barnett,
the
states
have
just
operated
that
sufferance
of
the
federal
government
in
these
areas,
somewhere
in
your
discussion,
if
you
would
treat
that
problem?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
takes
us
back
to
when
i
suggested
in
a
question
at
the
outset.
this
is
by
the
grace
of
the
federal
government
as
a
matter
of
generosity.
you
inform
the
states,
but
you
do
not
necessarily
do
any
more
than
inform
them
and
you
accept
their
conditions
when
you
find
them
acceptable?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
it
not
come
down
to
this?
does
your
position
not
necessarily
come
down
to
this
that
you
are
partners
except
that
when
you
disagree,
the
federal
government
is
the
supreme
partner?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
walston,
you
have
a
few
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgments
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
two
cases,
77-285
california
against
the
united
states
and
united
states
against
new
mexico
will
each
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
