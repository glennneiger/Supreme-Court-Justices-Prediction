of
course,
there

justice

there
is
no
problem
unless
there
is
a
conflict.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
possibility
was
that,
all
along,
it
worked
because
there
was
no
conflict
during
the
77
years.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
other
forms,
when
states
ruled
conflict
with
congress’
rules,
what
happened?
justice
thurgood
marshall
usually,
when
the
state
conflicts
with
congress,
congress
prevails.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
appreciate
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
addition,
i
think
it
would
be
hard
to
put
to
find
a
western
state
law
school
that
did
not
teach
water
law
and
you
will
not
find
any
eastern
ones
either?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
not
just
a
fact?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
recognize
the
fact
that
california
needs
water?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
eastern
state
needs
water?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
have
nay
water
law?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
around
its
consumptive
purposes
which
have
not
been
decided
upon?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
just
trying
to
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
know
it
would
never
happen,
but
if
you
did
build
a
reservoir
and
dam
that
was
too
big,
you
could
make
it
smaller.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
do
you
not
think
california
was
right
to
say
“what
are
you
going
to
do
with
this
water?”
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
barnett,
would
this
only
apply
to
california,
this
dam?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
does
a
federal
government
get
the
right
to
build
a
dam
in
the
middle
of
a
state
without
the
state’s
cooperation?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
congress,
i
would
assume
your
answer
would
be
yes,
cut
off
the
water
for
three
other
states
and
leave
it
all
in
one
state?
your
answer
has
to
be
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
to
get
back
to
my
other
question,
and
take
out
the
two
states.
they
had
build
a
dam
and
flood
half
of
the
state
for
the
benefit
of
the
other
half.
there
is
nothing
anybody
could
do
about
it.
then,
i
would
add
to
it,
they
would
flood
the
republican
side
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
waht
i
am
--
all
i
am
trying
to
get
to
is
we
have
gotten
along
fine
up
to
now
by
cooperating,
state
and
federal.
do
we
not
have
to
get
back
to
that?
