unknown
speaker
not
vested
water
rights?
unknown
speaker
did
you
really
mean
the
answer
to
justice
rehnquist
that
if
there
had
been
adjudicated
water
rights
in
the
state
of
california
without
condemning
them
and
buying
them?
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
he
asked
you.
unknown
speaker
you
answered
that
they
could.
unknown
speaker
so
you
agree
that
if
appreciate
right
that
has
been
adjudicated,
that
united
states
must
comply?
unknown
speaker
now,
let
us
talk
about
the
unappropriated
water.
unknown
speaker
what
power
do
you
say?
unknown
speaker
do
you
find
any
case
in
this
court
that
names
those
two
particular
powers?
unknown
speaker
what
power
do
you
suppose
united
states
is
exercising
to
build
a
reclamation
project
at
all?
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
think
the
welfare
clause?
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
way
this
court
has
talked
about
reclamation
projects
--
unknown
speaker
maybe
because
there
has
never
been
adjudication
from
this
court
as
to
who
owns
the
water
in
the
non-navigable
streams?
unknown
speaker
but
there
has
been
one
as
to
who
owns
the
water
in
the
navigable
streams,
has
there
not?
unknown
speaker
as
to
who
has
the
navigational
servitude
control?
unknown
speaker
no,
not
in
terms
of
ownership.
unknown
speaker
not
in
terms
of
ownership,
that
is
the
point.
unknown
speaker
you
would
say
that
it
would
also
be
sustainable
in
the
commerce
clause?
unknown
speaker
you
would
be
delighted
with
that.
unknown
speaker
you
would
be
delighted
with
that.
unknown
speaker
and
water
saving?
