mr.
louis
loss
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
may,
i
should
like
to
begin
by
agreeing
most
decidedly
with
my
brother
freeman,
that
judge
will
is
an
admirable
judge.
it
just
happens
that
judge
will
and
mr.
freeman
and
i
have
been
very
good
friends
for
40
years,
all
three
of
us.
now,
i
would
like
to
get
to
the
question.
mr.
louis
loss
i
had
little
difficulty
getting
that
motion
granted.
let
me
start,
if
i
may
with
a
brief
description
of
the
statutory
provisions
on
jurisdiction.
i
do
not
want
to
go
through
the
facts
again.
i
would
like
to
do
this.
under
all
of
the
sec
statutes,
except
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934,
the
federal
and
state
courts
are
given
concurrent
jurisdiction.
for
some
reason,
congress
in
the
34
act
said
the
federal
courts
shall
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
all
violations
of
this
act
at
all
suits
in
equity
or
actions
at
law
brought
to
enforce
any
liability
or
duty
created
by
this
act.
so
that
it
is
impossible
to
bring
a
10b-5
action
as
the
famous
fraud
rule
under
the
exchange
act
which
had
been
taking
over
the
universe.
it
is
impossible
to
bring
such
an
action
in
the
state
court.
now
then,
if
'x'
sues
'y'
for
breech
of
contract
or
for
declaratory
judgment
in
the
state
court
and
'y'
has
the
defense
based
on
rule
10b-5,
obviously
the
state
court
must
entertain
and
decide
the
defense
under
the
supremacy
clause.otherwise
it
might
be
giving
a
judgment
under
state
law
when
there
is
a
perfectly
good
federal
defense.
however,
that
in
a
sense
as
i
suggest
in
our
brief
is
an
imperfection
in
our
federal
system.
it
is
a
necessary
imperfection
in
our
federal
system
to
work.
it
does
not
follow
that
when
'x'
sues
'y'
in
the
state
court
for
let
us
say
breech
of
contract
or
in
this
case
since
the
alleged
brief
was
anticipatory
over
the
declaratory
judgment
action,
it
does
not
follow
that
when
'x'
sues
'y'
in
the
state
court
under
state
law
and
'y'
has
a
10b-5
defense
and
a
10b-5
counterclaim
because
when
section
27
of
the
exchange
act
says
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court,
it
says
over
all
actions.
not
just
actions
for
damages,
actions
for
rescission
as
well.
so
it
does
not
follow
that
when
the
state
court
defendant
moves
into
the
federal
court
expeditiously
as
a
federal
plaintiff
for
rescission,
forget
the
damages
for
the
moment.
let
us
assume
there
are
not
any,
for
rescission
in
the
federal
court,
it
does
not
follow,
but
in
that
case,
the
federal
court
should
go
out
of
its
way
and
ignore
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
that
congress
mandated
and
stay
its
hands
indefinitely
while
the
state
court
tries
the
whole
case
so
that
when
it
gets
back
to
the
federal
court,
unless
of
course
we
went
on
the
fraud
charge
as
a
common
law
but
why
should
we
be
put
to
all
of
that
litigation
when
we
have
federal
claims
and
defenses.
it
does
not
follow
that
in
that
case,
the
federal
courts
would
sit
on
its
hands
indefinitely
until
all
the
state
courts
finish
and
the
case
gets
back
to
the
federal
court
at
which
time,
the
only
decision
left
is
res
judicata
or
collateral
estoppel.
that
is
a
rather
strange
way
to
exercise
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
that
congress
gave
to
the
federal
court.
mr.
louis
loss
of
course,
your
honor,
we
do
not
suggest
for
a
moment
that
the
federal
court
is
completely
without
power
to
control
its
docket
all
of
brother
my
associate
justices.
there
are
stays
instead.
mr.
louis
loss
not
anymore,
but
i
suspect
that
the
reason
the
seventh
circuit
ordered
judge
will
to
proceed
?forthwith?
is
the
amount
of
delay
that
had
already
occurred
and
judge
will
has
already
said,
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
this
decision
by
the
state
judge
that
there
is
no
security
is
res
judicata
so
that
the
seventh
circuit
quite
properly
treated
that
as
if
it
were
a
dismissal
and
my
brother
freeman
twice
answered
questions
half
hour
ago
by
saying
yes.
a
decision
by
the
state
court
will
be
res
judicata.
we
do
not
conceive
that
except
arguendo.
but
there
is
at
least
a
good
--
i
must
conceive
arguendo
that
there
is
a
good
argument
that
any
decision
by
the
state
court
and
the
state
of
appellate
court
has
already
decided
there
is
no
security
will
be
res
judicata
if
the
case
ever
gets
back
to
the
federal
court.
that
is
what
we
are
complaining
about.
mr.
louis
loss
but
your
honor
he
postponed
it
so
indefinitely
and
so
fully
an
so
completely
that
the
only
question
left
for
him
if
it
ever
gets
back
will
be
not
was
there
a
security
which
is
the
question
that
congress
intended
him
to
decide,
but
is
the
state
decision
res
judicata
or
a
matter
of
collateral
estoppel.
mr.
louis
loss
no
your
honor
the
only
thing
that
is
enforceable
by
mandamus
as
this
court
very
recently
said
in
thermtron
products,
inc.against
hermansdorfer,
is
this,
the
court
said
a
traditional
use
of
the
writ
in
aid
of
appellate
jurisdiction
both
the
common
law
and
in
the
federal
courts
has
been
to
confine
an
inferior
court
to
a
lawful
exercise
of
its
prescribed
jurisdiction
or
to
compel
it
to
exercise
its
authority
when
it
is
its
duty
to
do
so
and
i
suggest
it
his
duty.
mr.
louis
loss
informed
there
was
a
dismissal
and
informed
here
there
was
a
mere
stay,
but
as
the
seventh
circuit
correctly
held,
i
submit,
a
stay
that
has
all
the
effect
of
a
dismissal
as
this
one
does
must
be
treated
like
a
dismissal
mandamus
purposes
and
i
cannot
see
how
my
brother
can
have
it
both
ways.
he
argues
it
is
mere
stay
but
then
he
also
says
yes
it
would
be
res
judicata
and
i
think
his
second
position
undoes
his
first.
mr.
louis
loss
at
some
point,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
loss
of
course,
indeed
we
worry
about
res
judicata
and
collateral-estoppel
although
we
do
not
admit
it,
we
worry
about
it
in
a
good
deal
and
that
is
why
we
are
here.
that
is
why
we
are
making
the
argument.
obviously?
mr.
louis
loss
well,
if
i
may
say
so
we
did
everything
we
should
have
done.
we
raised
these
questions
defensively.
mr.
louis
loss
we
had
to
or
we
might
have
risk
to
default
judgment.
mr.
louis
loss
we
had
to
your
honor
or
we
might
have
suffered
a
default
judgment
but
on
the
very
same
day
--
mr.
louis
loss
rather
than
my
answers
to
your
question.
mr.
louis
loss
well,
i
suppose
we
could
have
answered
solely
on
the
ground
that
awe
had
been
induced
to
enter
the
contract
by
fraud.
but
res
judicata
was
bar
as
to
all
arguably.
mr.
louis
loss
but
res
judicata
as
i
understand
it
applies
to
all
the
issues
that
should
have
been
raised
if
the
course
action.
mr.
louis
loss
we
are
talking
res
judicata.
mr.
louis
loss
if
it
is
basically
the
same
case
and
this
is
all
one
case.
mr.
louis
loss
if
we
have
to
someday
that
is
exactly
what
we
are
going
to
argue,
but
it
is
not
clear
your
honors
that
we
would
say
that
a
state
court
decision
without
jurisdiction
cannot
be
res
judicata.
they
will
say
they
at
least
had
jurisdiction
defensively
which
we
have
to
admit
that
is
the
imperfection
i
talked
about.
in
that
state
of
affairs
the
only
thing
we
could
say
certainly
is
that
the
questions
of
res
judicata
are
terribly
complex
and
this
is
perhaps
one
of
the
best
reasons
why
judge
will
should
have
proceeded
so
as
to
avoid
those
questions.
mr.
louis
loss
the
short
of
it
is
your
honor
that
counsel
for
calvert,
his
researches
did
not
reveal
to
his
mind
the
possibility
of
a
security
question
in
the
less
than
thirty
days.
if
that
kills
us
we
are
killed,
but
i
suggest
your
honors
that
it
should
not
for
a
number
of
reasons.
one,
our
negligence
if
you
like
or
our
failure
to
recognize
that
point
of
30
days
does
not
override
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court
in
so
far
as
it
deprives
the
state
courts.
mr.
louis
loss
it
does
not
your
honor
so
require.
on
the
other
hand
--
mr.
louis
loss
if
we
had
been
satisfied
to
stay
in
the
state
court,
the
state
court
could
have
and
should
have,
would
have
had
to
decide
the
federal
defense,
but
we
wanted
our
right
and
still
do
to
have
a
federal
court
for
various
reasons
decide
this
federal
question.
mr.
louis
loss
exactly.
it
is
also
truly
fortuitous
that
there
was
diversity
in
this
case.
if
there
have
not
been
complete
diversity
we
couldn't
have
moved
anyway
and
i
think
that
this
court
would
not
want
lay
down
the
rule,
it
depends
on
that
kind
of
fortuity.
so
that
i
think
that
our
failure
to
remove
regrettable
though
at
laws
should
not
be
a
very
significant
consideration
into
the
decision
of
the
case.
i
suggest
if
the
court
please,
that
our
case
rests
on
three
or
four
basic
simple
fundamental
propositions
that
could
be
stated
in
as
many
minutes.
one,
as
this
court
very
recently
and
unanimously
held
in
the
colorado
river
case,
i
quote,
it
is
the
duty
of
a
district
court
to
adjudicate
a
controversy
properly
before
it
and
in
that
same
case
this
court
called
the
duty
a
virtually
unflagging
obligation.
the
court
recognized
that
and
they
took
the
opportunity
to
summarize
in
a
very
useful
way
if
i
may
say
so.
the
various
abstention
doctrines
and
the
like,
but
emphasize
that
all
those
are
exceptions
to
this
virtually
unflagging
obligation.
mr.
louis
loss
in
a
sense
yes.
indeed
our
case
applies
a
fortiori
because
in
colorado
there
was
concurrent
jurisdiction.
here
there
was
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction.
mr.
louis
loss
true,
your
honor
except
our
answer
to
that
must
be
that
in
substance
there
was
a
dismissal
here.
this
was
not
an
ordinary
stay.
ordinary
stay
is
fine
and
indeed
if
the
case
comes
back
to
judge
well,
if
this
court
affirms
subject
to
whatever
the
forthwith
means
we
would
not
object
to
judge
will's
staying
this
case
for
a
few
months
if
he
had
other
business
that
was
more
important.
we
are
not
suggesting
that
the
federal
court
has
to
drop
everything
and
decide
10b-5
cases
before
other
cases,
but
we
are
suggesting
that
when
a
federal
court
?stays?
as
indefinitely
and
as
completely
as
in
this
case,
that
is
not
consistent
with
virtual
and
flagging
obligation
that
the
court
spoke
about
in
colorado.
mr.
louis
loss
the
state
court
could
do
several
things.
one,
we
would
hope
to
win
on
the
common
law
defense.
mr.
louis
loss
true
mr.
justice
marshall
when
i
said
indefinitely,
i
did
not
mean
an
temporal
sense.
i
meant
until
however
long
it
takes
the
state
court
and
the
state
appellate
courts
to
decide
the
question
completely
afterwards
there
is
nothing
left
for
the
federal
court
to
decide
except
the
res
judicata
or
collateral-estoppel
consequences
and
that
is
simply
not
doing
what
i
think
congress
wanted
the
federal
courts
to
do.
the
fact
that
we
could
get
complete
relief
by
successfully
defending
on
one
ground
or
another
including
the
federal
ground
in
the
state
court
should
not
deprive
us
of
our
right
to
have
a
federal
court
determine
our
action,
our
action
for
rescission,
27
says,
?all
actions?.
so
the
first
proposition
is
that
we
start
with
the
idea
abstention
and
so
on
is
an
exception.
the
second
proposition
is
that
if
anything
that
applies
a
fortiori,
when
the
federal
jurisdiction
is
exclusive
rather
concurrent
although
we
think
it
applies
in
either
of
them.
thirdly,
subject
to
mr.
rehnquist's
point,
which
i
hope
i
have
answered,
this
left
judge
well
with
what
this
court
called
a
clear
legal
duty
in
thermtron
to
decide
the
case
enforcible
by
mandamus.
forth
there
are
stays
and
stays
and
we
do
not
suggest
that
the
federal
court
is
completely
without
power
to
control
its
docket.
everything
that
my
brother
has
argued
is
an
attempt
somehow
to
get
around
if
he
must.
these
one
or
another
of
these
very
simple
propositions.
first
he
says,
we
can
get
complete
relief
by
successfully
defending
in
the
state
court.
i
have
answered
that
one
i
think.
it
is
true,
but
we
prefer
to
litigate
the
way
congress
said
we
had
the
right
to
litigate
by
being
an
action
for
rescission
in
the
federal
court.
mind
you
when
we
brought
that
nothing
had
happened
on
the
state
side
except
that
we
had
filed
a
motion
to
the
effect
that,
that
state
action
should
have
been
on
the
equity
side
because
it
reported
to
be
a
class
action
and
that
was
overruled
and
there
was
an
exchange
of
correspondence
about
discovery,
but
nothing
else.
the
same
day,
on
which
we
filed
an
answer
on
the
state
side,
we
filed
the
action
on
the
federal
side.
then
my
brother
freeman
says
that
calvert
does
not
need
10b-5
we
have
this
state
law
defense
and
everything
else
we
did
he
says
is
a
bunch
of
irrelevant
questions,
raises
irrelevant
questions.
well,
i
suggest
that
with
all
respect
these
are
not
irrelevant
questions.
we
chose
other
defenses
and
other
claims
which
congress
gave
us.
for
example,
if
we
satisfy
the
courts
some
day
that
there
is
security
here
there
will
be
nothing
left
to
litigate
except
the
summary
judgment
motion
because
anybody
who
sells
the
security
without
registration
is
liable
under
the
securities
act,
and
nobody
will
enforce
the
contract
that
violates
the
registration
provisions
of
the
securities
act.
so
i
do
not
think
it
is
from
my
brother
freeman
to
say
that
we
are
trying
to
litigate
irrelevant
questions.
then
the
argument
is
made
it
is
a
mere
stay
and
i
hope
i
have
answered
that.
mr.
louis
loss
well,
actually,
the
seventh
circuit
said
in
substance
it
is
an
abatement
because
whatever
it
is
i
do
not
think
it
is
important
to
put
labels
on
it
your
honor
whatever
it
is.
the
net
effect
i
must
say
again,
with
all
respect
is
to
deprive
us
of
our
day
in
the
federal
court
except
ultimately
on
the
question
of
res
judicata
and
that
simply
is
not
exercised
against
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
decide
questions
under
the
exchange
act.
mr.
louis
loss
whether
there
is
a
stay
or
a
dismissal,
i
respectfully
suggest
is
a
matter
of
substance
and
not
of
terminology.
mr.
louis
loss
if
something
has
to
be
called
a
dismissal
then
obviously
we
are
finished.
i
suggest
that
cannot
be
at
all.
mr.
louis
loss
well
if
we
prevail
on
any
our
defenses
in
the
state
court,
we
have
won
and
we
do
not
need
any
further
litigation.
mr.
louis
loss
well,
first
of
all,
10b-5
was
pleaded
as
a
defense
on
the
state
side.
mr.
louis
loss
we
allege
it
in
this
sense
--
mr.
louis
loss
yes,
your
honor
but
then.
mr.
louis
loss
if
we
prevail
on
any
of
our
defenses
in
the
state
court.
mr.
louis
loss
certainly
if
we
prevail
on
that
defense
work.
mr.
louis
loss
we
would
not
even
have
to
your
honor
because
we
would
have
got
everything
we
wanted.
they
are
suing
us
for
right
damages,
they
are
suing
us
for
declaratory
judgment
of
the
contracts
enforceable
and
if
we
have
a
10b-5
defense,
they
will
lose
their
case
and
we
are
finished.
mr.
louis
loss
oh
well
at
the
moment,
i
am
exceeding
arguendo
but
the
--
mr.
louis
loss
a
10b-5
claim
your
honor
can
be
also
a
basis
for
affirmative
rescission.
mr.
louis
loss
if
we
had
any
damages.
mr.
louis
loss
if
we
have
any
there,
very
minimal
in
terms
of
how
much
money
we
spent.
mr.
louis
loss
well,
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
we
do
if
we
lose
in
the
state
court
and
that
is
considered
res
judicata
we
have
lost
our
right
to
a
federal
forum.
mr.
louis
loss
that
was
going
to
be
my
clincher
your
honor.
if
this
court
leaves
this
case
to
the
state
court,
then
this
court
inevitably
in
cases
like
this
is
going
to
be
the
first
federal
court
on
the
scene
and
this
court
is
going
to
be
under
considerable
pressure
to
grant
more
writs
for
certiorari
that
it
is
today.
mr.
louis
loss
because
that
will
be
the
only
way
--
mr.
louis
loss
yes
so
far
as
the
state
--
mr.
louis
loss
yes,
but
i
do
suggest
that
the
net
effect
of
leaving
these
cases
to
the
state
courts
and
ignoring
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
district
court
this
will
be
that
this
will
be
the
only
way
to
correct
federal
error
in
this
court.
mr.
louis
loss
only
this
your
honor
that
our
case
would
be
stronger
because
there
was
concurrent
jurisdiction
and
here
so
far
as
10b-5
is
concerned
the
federal
jurisdiction
is
exclusive,
so
if
anything
this
is
a
stronger
thing.
mr.
louis
loss
only
about
way
of
defense,
suppose
for
example,
that
i
assume?
mr.
louis
loss
let
us
assume
my
brother
freeman
for
breach
of
contract
involving
a
patent
of
his
defenses
that
the
patent
is
invalid.
mr.
louis
loss
that's
right.
mr.
louis
loss
i
must
repeat
the
section
27
says
a
federal
courts
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
all
actions.
mr.
louis
loss
that
is
why
we
have
been
asking
for
rescission,
and
i
do
not
think
with
all
respect
that
it
is
for
this
court
to
say
that
we
can
exercise
that
rescission
argument
by
way
of
defense
in
the
state
court
by
which
we
can.
congress
said
we
have
a
right
to
a
federal
court.
mr.
louis
loss
but
that
is
only
if
we
win
your
honor.
we
have
decided
--
mr.
louis
loss
yes
your
honor,
but
we
are
entitled
to
our
view
as
counsel
that
we
have
a
better
chance
to
win
ultimately
in
the
federal
court
system.
we
think
the
federal
judges
are
more
experienced
in
these
matter,
they
feel
more
about
what
a
security
is
and
then
the
state
courts
too
there
are
a
hundreds
of
federal
cases
only
a
handful
of
state
cases
and
we
are
entitled
to
the
federal
jurisdiction,
congress
gave
to
us.
mr.
louis
loss
in
that
sense
it
is
true
your
honor,
but
i
do
not
think
we
have
been
delaying
in
any
sense
we
have
nothing
to
gain
except
perhaps
the
use
of
the
money.
mr.
louis
loss
we
are
anxious
to
have
this
case
determined
and
indeed
we
were
surprised
and
i
think
judge
will
was,
it
never
occurred
to
us
when
we
filed
this
federal
lawsuit
that
it
would
end
up
this
way
with
a
deference
to
the
state
courts.
i
still
think
it
is
a
remarkable
thing
that
happened
and
judge
will
indicated
his
disappointment
that
the
state
judge
decided
this
question
when
he
thought
he
was
going
to
get
to
decide
it,
but
once
the
state
court
decided
he
said
that
res
judicata
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
the
best
evidence
that
his
so
called
stay
was
a
dismissal
in
substance.
thank
you
very
much.
