unknown
speaker
was
the
securities
law
issue
pending
in
the
state
court?
unknown
speaker
could
it
have
been
disposed
off
in
the
state
court?
unknown
speaker
it
could
not
have
been
re-litigated,
if
it
had
been
decided
a
certain
way
in
the
state
court?
unknown
speaker
certainly,
you
could
not
present
your
counterclaim,
you
could
not
present
the
10b-5
claim
there
at
all.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
if
you
have
a
10b-5
claim,
you
might
want
to
press
it.
unknown
speaker
that
means
i
suppose
that
there
was
a
violation
of
10b-5.
unknown
speaker
assuming
you
prevailed
on
that
in
the
state
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
were
damaged
by
the
10b-5
violation,
i
suppose
you
could
then
press
it
in
the
only
court
you
could
press
it
in.
unknown
speaker
i
am
talking
about
just
about
the
10b-5
claim
here.
unknown
speaker
then
you
could
come
right
back
to
the
federal
court
and
move
on.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
it
did
you
some
damages.
unknown
speaker
that
is
a
kind
a
claim
,
but
10b-5
is
--.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that,
but
nevertheless
you
could
come
back
to
the
federal
court
with
your
10b-5
claim
if
you
--
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
so
you
are
to
be
precluded
from
return
to
the
federal
court,
if
you
prevail
on
your
federal
claims
and
if
you
do
not,
i
am
not
sure
you
have
much
to
complain
about
either.
