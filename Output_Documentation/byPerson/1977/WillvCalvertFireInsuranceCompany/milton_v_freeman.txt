mr.
milton
v.
freeman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
the
hon.hubert
l.will
is
the
united
states
district
judge
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois.
as
this
court
knows,
he
is
one
of
our
most
distinguished
trial
judges.
he
has
been
asked
on
a
number
of
occasions
to
address
the
seminars
conducted
by
the
judicial
center
for
newly
appointed
united
states
district
judges
to
instruct
them.
in
the
1971-1971
volume,
he
summarized
the
basic
assumptions
upon
which
trial
courts
work
as
follows.
the
objective
and
responsibility
of
our
legal
system
is
to
produce
the
highest
quality
of
justice
in
the
shortest
time
and
at
the
lowest
cost
consistent
therewith.
justice,
particularly
the
highest
quality
is
unique
in
each
case
must
be
handcrafted
by
the
most
skilled
artisans
available,
each
case
tailored
to
its
own
characteristics.
the
production
of
justice
is
essentially
a
job
shop
as
distinguished
from
a
mass
production
operation.
this
case
is
a
case
which
tests
whether
that
standard
will
continue
to
be
applied
to
the
work
of
united
states
district
judges.
the
petition
granted
by
this
court
was
to
review
a
mandamus
of
a
panel
of
the
seventh
circuit
requiring
judge
will
to
proceed
to
try
a
case
immediately
despite
the
fact
that
in
his
judgment,
the
particular
case
should
not
be
tried
but
should
be
stayed
because
the
same
parties
had
the
same
issues
pending
before
a
state
court
in
a
prior
pending
proceeding.
every
issue
was
identical.
it
was
clear
to
him
that
it
would
be
the
most
wasteful
and
duplicate
of
exercise
for
him
to
proceed
to
act.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
it
was
indeed
your
honor.
it
was
a
defense.
it
was
the
department
of
defense
to
the
complaint
in
the
state
court
and
it
was
the
second
count
in
the
complaint
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
it
could
have
been.
it
is
conceded
by
the
respondent
here
that
--
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
well,
i
am
not
sure
what
the
other
parties
would
say
about
it.
i
would
think
it
could
not
be
re-litigated
but
it
was
pending
before
that
court.
it
could
be
deiced
by
the
state
court
and
it
was
in
fact,
judge
will?s
thought
that
the
issues
being
identical
and
between
the
same
parties
that
the
litigation
of
the
state
court
would
dispose
off
the
matter
finally,
and
he
would
never
have
to
do
anything
further
with
it
unless
something
unforeseen
came
up.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
well,
he
could
have
proceeded
to
try
the
case
in
a
race
with
the
state
court
to
decide
--
who
would
decide
which
issue
first.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
i
think
there
were
none
your
honor,
and
the
issue
that
was
presented
to
him
was,
should
he
stay
in
the
interest
of
avoiding
duplicate
and
wasteful
litigation.
he
had
not
hesitation
about
that.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
present
to
the
court
the
facts
in
the
case.
the
calvert
insurance
company
is
a
baltimore,
maryland
insurance
company
that
engaged
in
conversations
with
the
american
reinsurance
corporation
which
ran
a
reinsurance
pool
for
casualty
insurance.
as
of
january
1st
,
1974,
the
calvert
company
joined
the
pool
which
consisted
of
99
other
insurance
companies
to
reinsure
casualty
risks.
that
took
place
in
january
of
1974.
in
early
april,
two
events
took
place
which
the
parties
are
contesting
before
judge
will.
one
is
that
a
series
of
tornadoes
occurred
in
the
middle
west
and
that
the
insurance
publication
said
that
re-insurers
would
be
called
?murdered?.
also
in
early
april
1973,
the
financial
statements
of
the
reinsurance
pool
for
the
year
1973
became
available.
late
april,
the
calvert
company
said
we
have
been
misled
by
the
information
we
have
been
given
as
to
the
previous
years
functioning
of
this
pool.
it
is
regarded
by
us
as
material
and
we
believe
we
are
entitled
to
cancel
this
agreement
as
of
the
day
we
entered
into
january
1st,
1974
and
avoid
liability.
after
some
discussion,
the
parties
agreed
that
calvert
would
be
excused
after
the
year
1974
but
the
pool
insisted
that
it
was
liable
for
the
year
1974
and
brought
suit
in
a
state
court,
the
99
insurance
companies
members
to
the
pool,
sued
the
calvert
company
and
said
we
want
a
declaratory
judgment
that
calvert
is
responsible
for
the
losses
which
appeared
to
be
likely
the
result
in
the
pool.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
no,
being
obligated
to
respond
to
the
losses.
in
other
words,
there
were
losses
that
were
going
to
be
in
the
reinsurance.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
responsible
for
the
losses
which
appeared
to
be
likely
to
result.
the
state's
suit
was
brought
as
i
say
july
3rd,
1974,
for
a
declaratory
judgment.
calvert
by
reason
of
diversity
said,
it
could
have
removed
the
case
to
the
federal
court.
it
did
not
do
so.
it
filed
various
motions
in
the
state
court
and
then
on
january
10th,
1975,
six
months
later,
it
filed
denials,
answers
and
counterclaims
in
the
state
court
and
denials,
answers
and
counterclaims
were
that
membership
in
this
pool
was
a
security.
that
the
security
had
been
sold
to
them
one,
in
violation
of
the
1933
securities
act,
in
violation
of
rule
10b-5
of
the
34a.
this
was
by
way
of
an
affirmative
defense
that
had
been
sold
in
violation
of
the
illinois
securities
law
that
had
been
sold
in
violation
of
the
maryland
securities
law
and
also
there
are
certain
additional
defenses
that
the
american
people
did
not
have
the
right
to
sue
and
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
illinois
insurance
statute.
on
the
very
same
day,
a
complaint
was
filed
in
the
federal
court
and
the
complaint
in
the
federal
court
tracked
exactly
what
the
affirmative
defenses
were
in
the
state
court.
in
other
words
count
one,
in
the
federal
court
was
securities
act
of
1933
as
the
first
affirmative
defense
was.
count
two
was
violation
of
10b-5
of
34
a,
that
was
affirmative
defense
two.
count
three
was
the
illinois
securities
law
affirmative
defense
three.
count
four
was
the
maryland
securities
law,
affirmative
defense
four.
count
five
common
law
being
misled
that
was
affirmative
defense
five.
there
were
two
additional
affirmative
defenses
which
were
not
reflected
in
the
federal
complaint.
it
was
an
absolute
mirror
image.
the
federal
suit
asked
with
respect
to
10b-5
which
is
the
essential
thing
that
in
the
state
court
suit,
the
relief
requested
on
the
10b-5
count
was
that
there
should
be
rescission
of
the
pool's
contract.
in
the
federal
court,
the
claim
was
there
should
be
rescission
identical
or
in
the
alternative
for
$2
million
damages
and
that
is
the
difference
between
the
federal
complaint
and
the
state
complaint.
the
proceedings
were
brought
before
judge
will
and
a
motion
to
stay
was
made.
judge
will
said,
this
is
a
perfect
case
for
a
stay.
the
parties
have
a
course
of
action
pending
before
the
state
court,
it
had
been
filed
six
months
before.
this
is
reactive
litigation.
it
is
duplicative.
it
is
wasteful.
i
will
have
no
part
of
it.
i
will
stay
my
action.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
i
would
think
the
federal
jurisdiction
still
persists
because
he
has
not
dismissed
it.
the
case
is
still
pending
but
it
might
well
be
that
a
res
judicata
defense
would
be
adequate
to
dispose
off
the
motion.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
that
is
right
and
that
was
indeed
judge
will?s
hope
that
there
might
be
no
necessity
for
using
any
federal
judicial
power
if
the
issues
were
fully
litigated
and
decided
in
the
state
court.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
there
is
no
question
that
it
is
conceded
that
the
federal
question
so
called
is
a
question
which
the
state
court
not
only
has
a
right
to
decide
but
must
under
the
supremacy
clause
decide.
in
other
words,
if
there
is
a
violation
of
federal
law,
that
is
a
defense
to
a
state
court
action.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
no,
it
is
not
to
the
exclusion.
there
is
no
question
that
the
?
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
if
there
is
a
state
court
holding,
res
judicata
applies
between
a
state
court
and
a
federal
court.
the
federal
court
does
not
have
an
exclusive
right
to
try
the
case
unless
it
wants
to.
the
federal
court
has
jurisdiction.
it
does
not
have
to
exercise
that
jurisdiction,
if
the
parties
have
another
form,
state
or
federal
in
which
they
can
litigate
it.
if
that
decision,
if
the
issue
is
litigated
in
another
forum
and
decided
in
another
forum
then
it
is
clear,
for
example,
if
the
forum
decides
that
calvert
was
in
fact
misled
and
is
not
bound
then
that
judgment
should
be
presented
to
judge
will
and
judge
will
will
decide
whether
that
is
res
judicata.
presumably,
as
i
understand
res
judicata,
it
would
be
res
judicata.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
that
is
right
and
that
was
judge
will?s
hope
here
that
the
matter
would
be
disposed
off
where
it
had
first
been
placed
in
the
state
court
and
that
there
would
be
no
necessity
to
exercise
federal
jurisdiction
but
if
there
were
for
some
reason,
the
activities
in
the
state
court
had
not
disposed
off
the
matter
then
he
reserved
the
jurisdiction
for
a
time
when
he
could
know
how
much
federal
judicial
time
and
energy
would
necessarily
be
applied
to
that.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
yes,
you
have
a
right?
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
i
am
sorry
your
honor.
i
am
saying
that
the
right
to
remove
which
existed
in
this
case
was
granted
by
congress
for
a
period
of
30
days.
during
that
30
days,
that
right
not
having
been
exercised
it
was
gone
forever.
in
other
words,
if
somebody
is
going
to
say,
i
do
not
want
litigation
in
the
state
court,
he
has
to
notify
them
promptly.
that
is
what
congress
said.
they
did
not
do
that.
they
had
a
right
to
come
into
federal
court
yet
they
did
not
exercise
that
right.
they
let
the
time
pass.
six
months
later,
they
have
started
an
independent
lawsuit
raising
the
same
issues.
a
reactive
duplicate
of
lawsuit.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
diversity
of
citizenship.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
the
maryland
corporation.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
that
is
right.
there
was
no
federal
question.
it
was
a
simple
declaratory
judgment
action
under
state
law
filed
in
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county
law
department.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
that
is
right.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
yes.
apparently.
i
have
not
counted
all
the
99
but
i
am
so
advised.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
but
this
was
a
maryland
corporation
that
was
being
sued
and
they
had
a
right
to
remove
it.
the
seventh
circuit
granted
a
writ
of
mandamus.
it
said
we
recognize
in
this
circuit,
in
exactly
identical
circumstances
aetna
state
bank
against
altheimer
is
a
case
of
a
10b-5
claim
in
federal
court,
parallel
with
the
state
claim
of
the
same
effect.
we
recognize
that
the
federal
district
courts
have
discretion
and
that
is
the
rule
that
we
apply
and
what
judge
will
did
in
this
case
was
perfectly
correct
in
accordance
with
our
rule
and
we
follow
landis
against
north
american
opinion
by
mr.
justice
cardozo
and
that
is
the
rule
in
this
court.
however,
since
judge
will
ruled,
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
has
decided
the
colorado
river
case
and
indian
water
rights
case
and
we
believe
that
we
are
obliged
by
the
rulings
of
the
supreme
court
to
reverse
our
findings
in
altheimer,
to
reverse
our
adherence
to
judge
cardozo's
opinion
in
landis
against
north
american
and
to
say
that
the
district
courts
have
no
discretion
whatsoever
that
whenever
a
case
raising
a
federal
claim
is
presented
to
them,
they
must
try
the
case
and
that
we
direct
judge
will
immediately
to
try
the
case,
we
say
our
own
altheimer
case
based
on
the
landis
case
is
overruled
and
reversed
as
no
longer
the
law.
four
of
the
active
judges
thought
that
was
such
a
remarkable
ruling
and
such
a
misconstruction.
they
wanted
en
banc
consideration
but
four
of
eight
is
not
a
majority
and
so
we
are
here.
we
say
that
plainly
the
seventh
circuit
panel
misconstrued
the
colorado
river
case.
it
was
a
case
in
which
this
court
was
motivated
by
the
same
considerations
of
judicial
economy
by
which
judge
will
is
motivated,
that
is
was
a
specific
case
as
to
the
construction
of
the
mccarran
amendment
and
both
majority
and
dissenting
judges
in
that
case
proceeded
from
different
views
as
to
what
was
judicial
economy
but
in
both
cases,
the
supreme
court
said
we
are
concerned
with
conservation
of
judicial
resources
and
in
fact,
on
two
occasions,
the
colorado
river
case
cited
landis
against
north
american
which
the
seventh
circuit
panel
felt
had
been
overruled
by
colorado
river.
we
say
that
if
the
decision
below
is
not
vigorously
rejected
by
this
court,
it
will
encourage
wasteful
and
duplicate
of
litigation.
it
will
make
much
more
difficult
efficient,
low
cost,
high
quality
justice
and
that
is
why
judge
will
insisted
on
taking
this
case
up.
the
parties
would
not
take
it
up.
the
department
of
justice
has
a
rule
that
they
will
not
represent
judges
when
private
lawsuits
are
involved
in
mandamus
cases
and
they
suggested
that
he
retain
private
counsel
and
he
has
done
so.
it
is
because
of
his
devotion
to
the
swift
and
economical
administration
of
justice
and
its
feeling
that
the
necessity
of
having
a
ruling
from
this
court
that
applies
not
only
to
him
and
not
only
to
this
case
but
to
all
other
cases
to
show
that
this
court
did
not
mean
in
the
colorado
river
case
what
the
seventh
circuit
panel
felt
it
meant.
this
case
is
consequently
not
the
most
important
aspect
of
the
matter
but
i
would
like
to
examine
it
to
show
what
can
happen
if
this
kind
of
thing
is
allowed
to
go
forward.
here
is
a
very
simple
case
presented
to
the
state
court.calvert
people
said,
we
were
misled.
the
pool
people
said
you
were
not
misled.
that
was
a
fair
deal
and
it
is
perfectly
clear
calvert
was
misled,
they
could
be
excused
from
performance.
if
they
were
not
misled,
they
would
not
be
excused
from
performance.
what
is
the
result
of
the
federal
action?
all
kinds
of
irrelevant
questions
are
raised.
is
there
a
security?
is
there
a
violation
of
10b-5?
is
there
a
violation
of
maryland
law
or
of
illinois
law?
they
do
not
see
any
difference.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
i
would
think
that
the
test
in
the
state
proceedings
would
be
less
than
it
would
be
under
the
securities
act.
in
other
words,
if
there
were
a
false
statement
or
a
misleading
statement
that
was
material,
it
would
be
a
defense
in
the
state
proceedings
as
a
matter
of
common
law
even
without
the
requirements
of
intent
to
deceive,
scienter
required
by
ernest
case.
so
that
they
had
a
perfect
defense
if
they
were
in
fact
misled,
even
innocently
by
the
pool
people.
in
other
words,
if
the
earnings
of
the
pool
were
material
and
they
had
been
misstated
and
they
were
misled
by
that
and
till
joining
the
pool,
they
were
home
free.
on
the
other
hand,
no
matter
how
many
times
the
court
decides
that
a
security
is
at
involved,
that
does
not
help
them
because
they
have
to
prove
that
a
false
statement
was
made,
that
it
was
material,
that
they
are
relying
upon
it.
so
the
question
which
has
been
presented
by
this
reactive
federal
lawsuit
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
merits
of
the
case,
it
will
not
dispose
off
it
for
or
against
calvert.
the
sole
issue
which
is
involved
is
were
they
misled
or
were
they
not
misled?
but
because
of
this
running
back
and
forth
between
the
federal
and
the
state
courts,
we
stand
now
at
a
situation
in
terms
of
swift
and
efficient
justice
where
four
years
almost
after
the
lawsuit
was
filed
in
the
state
court,
nothing
has
happened.
the
first
deposition
has
not
been
taken.
the
first
item
of
discovery
has
not
been
taken
while
it
is
decided
what
should
be
done.
judge
will
saw
that.
he
said
i
will
not
have
any
part
to
that.
i
will
stand
aside
and
i
will
let
the
state
courts
decide
that.
but
because
the
court
of
appeals
panel
in
this
case,
saw
it
differently
and
they
felt
that
this
court
had
obliged
them
to
overrule
what
they
regarded
as
a
correct
exercise
of
discretion
and
they
have
said
that
this
court
had
compelled
them
to
deprive
district
courts
of
the
jurisdictions
that
they
had
previously
been
thought
to
have
under
justice
cardoza?s
opinion
in
the
north
american
case.
it
is
most
important
that
this
court
correct
those
deficiencies,
announce
that
it
does
recognize
the
necessity
of
district
courts
shaping
remedies
on
a
handcrafted
basis
as
judge
will
said,
for
the
purpose
of
seeing
to
it
that
justice
is
provided
economically
and
without
unnecessary
delay
and
it
is
for
that
reason
that
we
are
here
and
that
judge
will
desires
a
ruling
from
this
court
that
his
colorado
river
decision
has
been
misconstrued,
that
the
rule
of
landis
against
north
american
remains
the
law
and
that
he
and
his
fellow
district
judges
throughout
the
country
have
the
kind
of
discretion
that
is
necessary
to
see
that
efficient
judicial
process
occurs
and
that
justice
is
not
unduly
delayed
by
complicating
and
duplicated
ways.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
that
was
his
understanding
at
that
time,
mr.
justice
stevens
but
i
called
mr.
weather?s
counsel
for
the
american
reinsurance
company
yesterday
morning
and
he
told
me
that
he
had
filed
a
request
for
depositions
and
had
filed
notices
to
admit
or
whatever
and
nothing
has
been
done.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
well,
i
do
not
know
what
happened
in
the
state
case
but
may
i
suggest
from
my
own
point
of
view
that
the
state
courts
have
great
respect
for
the
federal
judiciary
and
if
something
is
pending
before
the
federal
courts
that
it
may
induce
them
to
--
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
precisely
your
honor.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
no
but
if
his
stay
order
had
been
allowed
to
stand,
then
the
rule
would
have
been
clear
that
the
state
courts
did
not
have
to
wait
on
him,
that
they
could
have
proceeded
and
they
would
have
felt
free.
it
is
only
because
judge
will?s
sensible
and
reasonable
decision
was
overruled
in
a
mandamus
issue
against
him
by
the
appellate
court
that
that
state
courts
properly
regard
the
matter
as
of
some
consequence
as
to
whether
the
state
and
federals
courts
are
or
should
be
actively
involved
and
they
think
that
they
are
in
a
position
where
they
may
have
to
wait
for
each
other
for
the
federal
courts
and
the
federal
courts
have
not
said
that
they
do
not
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
the
fact
of
the
matter,
as
i
understand
from
the
briefs
is
that
no
money
has
been
paid
by
them.
they
had
just
assumed
the
responsibility
for
the
certain
amount
of
losses
and
they
have
gotten
the
right
to
get
a
certain
amount
of
premiums.
they
have
not
paid
any
money
as
i
understand.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
this
is
not
such
a
case
and
such
a
case
would
be
a
question
of
which
a
remedy
as
to
stay
would
be
shaped
by
the
judge
in
his
discretion.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
first
i
think
i
should
make
it
clear
that
the
reason
that
the
state
courts
have
not
acted
in
this
case
and
have
waited
is
that
every
action
as
i
understand
has
been
on
a
motion
for
stay
by
calvert
so
that
they
are
in
a
hurry
to
get
justice,
they
are
not
in
a
hurry
to
get
justice
in
the
state
court
to
which
judge
will
remitted
them.
then
mr.
loss
says
if
we
get
it
decided
that
this
is
a
security,
then
we
have
some
rights
because
you
cannot
sell
a
security
without
registration.
but
that
is
under
the
33
act
where
there
is
no
exclusive
jurisdiction
as
there
is
on
10b-5
where
the
congress
said
suit
may
be
brought
in
any
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
so
as
far
as
the
33
act
is
concerned
on
which
mr.
loss
is
mentioning
his
reliance,
that
that
is
something
that
congress
said
you
can
go
into
a
state
court
and
you
can
bring
affirmative
actions
in
the
state
court
and
so
that
there
is
no
exclusive
federal
right.
that
leaves
them
down
to
10b-5
and
he
says
i
have
got
a
10b-5
claim
which
will
let
me
off
in
the
state
court
but
i
would
like
to
go
into
a
federal
court
because
i
prefer
that
and
he
has
got
a
right
to
do
that
under
the
first
amendment
but
it
seems
to
me
to
be
perfectly
clear
that
that
is
what
federal
judges
are
for
to
see
that
rights
which
are
provided
by
statute
are
not
abused
so
that
the
courts
are
made
mere
puppets
to
carry
out
the
desires
of
litigants
for
one
forum
rather
than
the
other
when
they
are
both
able
to
give
justice.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
the
essential
element
here
as
to
whether
you
are
going
to
give
trial
judges
the
right,
the
discretion
free
of
the
threat
of
mandamus
when
they
exercise
what
the
panel
itself
down
below
said
was
a
correct
decision
on
discretion
that
this
will
result
in
more
efficient
justice,
more
promptly.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
no,
your
honor,
there's
two
separate
entirely.
one
is
the
right
to
come
in
the
federal
court
by
way
of
diversity.
that
was
lost
because
they
waited
beyond
30
days.
congress
gave
them
30
days
to
decide
where
they
wanted
to
litigate.
they
had
the
choice
and
they
gave
it
up.
the
other
point
is
that
there
is
it
is
true
a
statement
in
the
exchange
act
that
when
you
have
a
securities
case
and
a
violation
of
the
securities
exchange
act
and
you
want
to
sue
for
damages
for
that,
then
only
the
federal
court
may
give
you
damages.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
only
for
damages.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
yes,
we
do.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
that
is
the
difference
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
his
pleadings
in
the
state
court
are
very
clear
on
that
point.
they
raise
10b-5
as
a
defense,
then
they
have
a
counterclaim
and
they
leave
10b-5
out
of
the
counterclaim.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
in
the
federal
court,
it
was
for
rescission
or
in
the
alternative,
for
$2
million
in
damages.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
i
think
it
is
irrelevant
your
honor.
that
was
a
question
of
whether
and
we
were
involved
in
that
case.
that
was
a
case
of
a
suit
on
notes.
the
defense
was
a
violation
of
the
anti-trust
laws.
what
the
court
said
was
that
the
amount
of
the
notes
were
of
such
a
nature
that
they
had
no
relation
to
the
issue
of
the
defense
so
that
it
was
not
an
appropriate
defense
to
the
claim
on
the
notes
and
the
supreme
court
decided
five
to
four
that
we
could
not
make
an
anti-trust
defense
and
had
to
bring
a
separate
anti-trust
suit.
we
could
not
even
raise
a
defense
in
that
case
whereas
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
in
this
case,
it
is
conceded
that
the
defense
of
10b-5
can
be
raised,
it
has
been
raised.
it
is
before
the
state
court.
neither
party
questions
that
the
defense
can
be
raised
whereas
in
bruce?s
juices,
the
point
was
that
the
defense
of
anti-trust
violation
could
not
be
raised
in
a
state
court
on
a
suit.
