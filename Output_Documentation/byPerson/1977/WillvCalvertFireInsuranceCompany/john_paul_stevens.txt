mr.
freeman,
i
am
just
rusty
in
one
part
of
this
case,
what
was
the
source
of
the
right
to
remove?
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
diversity
grounds.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
the
federal
question
was
not
introduced
by
the
plaintiff
in
the
state
court
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
there
complete
diversity
with
all
of
the
defendants
on
the
state
side?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
surprises
me
a
little
bit
being
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
assuming
that
the
test
of
being
misled
is
the
same
in
the
state
proceedings,
it
would
be
under
the
securities
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
freeman,
before
you
sit
down,
i
have
two
questions.
did
i
correctly
understand,
you
said
that
there
has
been
no
progress
in
the
state
court
proceeding?
i
understood
from
judge
will?s
opinion
there
had
been
discovery
in
the
state
court
action
that
was
going
forward?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
do
not
understand
why
the
delay
and
the
dependency
of
the
federal
case
should
have
slowed
down
the
state
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
wait
for
each
other
forever.
justice
john
paul
stevens
my
second
question,
mr.
freeman,
is
it
perfectly
clear
that
if,
i
forgot
which
companies
prevails
in
the
state
court,
proving
there
was
deception,
therefore
they
did
not
have
to
participate
in
the
pool,
would
it
necessarily
follow
that
they
would
not
also
be
entitled
to
recover
some
damages,
i
don't
know
and
you
can
defy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
there
could
be
cases
in
which
the
state
case
would
not
necessarily
end
everything
and
then
you
have
to
try
the
federal
case
sooner
or
later
anyway.
but
you
say,
this
is
not
such
a
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
he
considered,
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
loss
how
would
you
have
suffered
the
default
judgment.
i
understand
you
had
several
defenses?
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
on
the
security
issue.
how
would
it
barge
you
on
the
security
issue
if
you
had
not
raised
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
the
argument
that
you
could
have
avoided
all
these
complexities
by
removing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
on
the
other
side
of
the
balance
i
suppose
you
mentioned
that
10b-5
is
sort
of
taking
over
the
universe.
it
is
awful
lot
of
litigation
that
may
end
up
in
the
federal
court,
if
every
10b-5
and
every
antitrust
defense
is
ever
available
requires
that
the
case
be
tried
in
the
first
instance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
that
the
judge
does
not
have
power
to
deny
that
you
have
a
right
to
go
forward
in
the
federal
--.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because,
the
colorado
case
itself
was
an
exception
too,
wasn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
even
on
that
point
the
issue
is
whether
there
is
a
security,
where
there
is
a
problem.
you
really
do
not
have
any
damage
claim
if
you
win
so
that
there
is
not
anything
that
is
exclusive.
your
exclusive
right
is
to
recover
damages
but
this
is
a
non
damage
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
but
it
is
just
the
other
side
of
the
coin.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
judgment
that
would
be
entered
if
you
prevail
on
the
rescission
action,
has
precisely
the
same
practical
consequences
as
a
judgment
that
would
be
entered
in
your
favor
in
the
state
court
on
the
securities
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
be
the
same
if
you
lose
in
both
courts
too
the
judgment
will
be
precisely
the
same
win
or
lose.
if
you
lose
then
you
owe
the
money
into
the
pool.
justice
john
paul
stevens
another
irony
of
this
case
as
i
begin
to
sink
in
on
me
that
apparently
delay
in
this
case
is
entirely
to
the
benefit
of
your
client
is
it
not
because
you
do
not
have
to
pay
the
money
while
the
case
is
still
dragging
along.
justice
john
paul
stevens

insurance
companies
