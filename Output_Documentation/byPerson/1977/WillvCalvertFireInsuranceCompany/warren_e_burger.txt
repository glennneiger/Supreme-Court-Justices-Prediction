chief

warren
e.
burger
at
1
o'
clock,
counsel,
we
will
hear
the
case
of
will
against
the
insurance
company.
i
would
to
ask
you
to
cut
your
arguments.
mr.
freeman,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
other
alternatives
were
available
to
him
other
than
deferring
to
the
state
court
was
there
any
other
alternative?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
any
other
alternatives?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
it
goes
to
trial
in
the
state
court
and
then
goes
to
judgment,
what
is
the
status
of
the
matter
then
with
respect
to
federal
jurisdiction?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
is
always
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
one
of
the
parties
would
not
like
the
result
in
the
state
court.
then
you
re-litigate
in
the
federal
court?
you
are
suggesting
that
a
res
judicata
might
prevent
litigating
then.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
the
right
to
have
the
federal
question
litigated
in
the
state
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
the
exclusion
of
the
federal
court's
right
to
try
the
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
not
sure,
i
track
what
you
mean
about
res
judicata
of
the
state
court
holding.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
the
hypothetical
suggested
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist
prevail
if
one
of
the
parties
having
the
diversity
and
the
right
to
try
it
in
federal
court
objected
to
the
proceedings
in
the
state
court
and
asked
for
removal?
this
is
not
a
matter
of
volition
in
this
case,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
one
of
the
parties?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
hardly
produces
the
expeditious
results
that
judge
will
is
hopeful
about,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
loss.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
could
not
be
here
without
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
it
make
any
differences
in
your
view
that
the
colorado
case
was
decided
under
the
mccarran
act
and
getting
with
the
securities.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
freeman
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
i
understand
mr.
freeman
that
you
agree
that
the
federal
jurisdiction
was
exclusive
and
that
that
exclusivity
was
lost
by
failure
to
move
within
30
days
to
remove
the
case
to
federal
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgments
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
--
judgment
of
the
court
in
will
against
calvert
fire
insurance
company
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
