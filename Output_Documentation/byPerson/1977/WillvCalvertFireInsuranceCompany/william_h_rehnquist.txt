justice
william
h.
rehnquist
responsible
in
the
sense
of
being
obligated
to
defendant?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
you
said
lawsuits.
you
said
losses.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
same
would
be
true
of
any
diversity
case,
would
it
not?
you
have
an
action
in
the
state
court
and
there
is
diversity
of
citizenship
here
but
action
on
the
same
claims
in
the
federal
court
and
whichever
one
you
prosecute,
the
judgment
will
probably
be
res
judicata
in
the
other.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
are
going
to
be
some
cases
though
mr.
loss
are
there
not
where
the
federal
court
for
one
reason
or
another
is
going
to
say
there
are
related
proceedings
pending
in
another
court
and
we
are
just
not
going
to
set
a
trial
later,
we
are
not
going
to
have
discovery
for
the
next
six
months
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
seventh
circuit
really
an
issue
in
writ
of
mandamus,
which
i
understood
to
entertain
the
idea
that
it
was
not
a
discretionary
obligation
of
the
judge
at
all
but
a
mandatory
duty
under
which
could
he
labored,
which
could
be
enforced,
by
mandamus
seems
to
me
to
have
said
that
judge
will
you
simply
do
not
have
that
kind
of
part
that
you
and
i
just
said
the
court
does?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
not
who
is
going
back
to
the
federal
court.
judge
will
did
not
dismiss
as
in
england
sense
or
pullman
sense,
he
simply
postponed
prosecution
of
the
case
in
the
federal
court,
didn't
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
these
are
questions
of
shading
and
degree.
how
long
do
you
wait
are
those
all
enforceable
by
mandamus?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
thermtron
there
was
a
dismissal.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
is
the
same
case
it
is
collateral-estoppel
it
applies
in
a
different
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
is
not.
i
thought
it
was
two
different
acts,
one
in
the
federal
court
and
one
in
the
state
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
has
to
only
when
the
plaintiff
wants
it
to.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
colorado
there
was
dismissal
not
simply
withholding.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
loss
it
is
not
even
a
stay
in
the
sense
that
justice
cardozo
referred
to
it
in
on
the
landis
case
where
there
one
part
was
staying
in
action,
in
other
words,
this
is
simply
judge
will
saying
in
the
control
of
my
own
docket,
i
will
not
call
this
case
for
trial
be
here
for
six
months.
so,
it
really
does
not
even
rise
to
level
of
a
stay.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
you
must
go
further
than
at
least
the
holdings
of
the
colorado
case
and
that
how
in
the
england
case
where
you
are
talking
about
dismissals
and
you
have
got
to
say
that
you
are
talking
about
calendar
control
of
individual
federal
district.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
freeman,
a
colloquy
has
developed
up
here
between
me
and
one
of
my
colleague
which
may
be
wholly
irrelevant
but
a
case
has
come
to
me
and
cited
in
neither
of
your
briefs
and
did
not
occur
to
me
until
now
called
bruce?s
juices,
decided
maybe
20
years
ago
with
the
availability
of
a
defense
to
enforceability
of
a
contract
made
in
violation
of
federal
law,
i
take
it
that
fact
that
cited
in
neither
brief
means
that
neither
of
you
considered
to
be
relevant
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
case
comes
to
us
from
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
which
is
mr.
justice
stevens'
old
court
and
it
involves
litigation
amongst
insurance
companies.
respondent
who
is
calvert
fire
insurance
company
had
been
sued
in
the
state
court
by
american
mutual
reinsurance
company,
which
sought
a
declaration
that
it's
reinsurance
agreement
with
respondent
remained
in
the
effect.
six
months
later,
the
respondent
filed
an
answer
in
counterclaim
in
the
state
court
in
chicago,
based
on
several
state
statutes,
common
law
of
fraud
and
federal
securities
act.
then
on
the
same
day
it
filed
a
complaint
in
the
federal
district
court
in
chicago,
seeking
damages
and
injunctive
relief
on
the
same
theories.
hubert
will
who
is
the
judge
of
the
district
court
in
chicago
and
is
a
petitioner
in
this
case,
granted
a
motion
to
defer
consideration
of
most
of
respondent's
claims
until
the
completion
of
the
concurrent
litigation
in
the
state
court.
although
judge
will
ruled
that
respondent's
claim
for
damages
under
the
federal
act
of
1934
over
which
the
federal
district
courts
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
remained
viable,
he
made
no
ruling
on
the
merits
of
that
claim
before
the
filing
of
this
mandamus
action
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
compel
them
to
make
a
ruling.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
did
issue
a
writ
of
mandamus,
relying
upon
this
court's
decision
in
colorado
river
conservation
district
versus
united
states
which
was
handed
down
after
judge
will
had
entered
his
order
deferring
the
state
proceedings.
we
now
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
in
a
plurality
opinion
which
i
have
authored
and
which
is
joined
by
mr.
justice
stewart
and
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
justice
stevens,
we
conclude
that
even
if
the
district
court's
action
was
wrong
under
our
colorado
river
decision,
that
error
has
to
be
corrected
on
appeal
and
was
not
subject
to
review
by
mandamus.
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
of
reversal.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
the
chief
justice,
mr.
justice
marshal
and
mr.
justice
powell
joined.
