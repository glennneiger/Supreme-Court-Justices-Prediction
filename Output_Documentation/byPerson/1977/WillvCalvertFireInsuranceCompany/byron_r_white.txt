they
could
remove

justice

r.
white
we
noticed
who
introduced
mr.
freeman
here
in
court
so?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
a
federal
suit
had
never
been
filed
until
after
the
state
suit
had
been
completed?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
must
agree
you
cannot
re-litigate
the
matter
in
the
federal
court.

if
a
fellow
with
a
defense
if
he
does
not
want
to
get
it
tried
in
a
state
court
and
even
present
it,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
certainly
tendered
it
to
the
state
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe,
but
you
also
asked
for
your
federal
claim
to
be
adjudicated?

depriving
ultimately
in
the
federal
court
but
once
you
prevail
on
the
state
court
on
your
federal
defense.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
there
a
prayer
for
damages
in
the
federal
court?
justice

r.
white
i
see
why
you
would
not
cite
it.
