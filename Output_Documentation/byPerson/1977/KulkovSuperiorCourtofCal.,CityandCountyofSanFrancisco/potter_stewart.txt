justice
potter
stewart
at
that
time,
at
what
time
are
we
talking
about,
mr.
stotter?
justice
potter
stewart
they
were
living
in
new
york
as
domiciliary
of
new
york
as
husband
and
wife?
justice
potter
stewart
up
to
the
time
of
the
haitian
decree,
at
least.
justice
potter
stewart
until
they
went
to
haiti
or
somebody
went
to
haiti
and
got
a
divorce
and
i
suppose
the
jurisdictional
support
for
that
divorce
was
somebody’s
domicile
in
haiti,
but
in
any
event,
they
had
been
living
in
new
york.
then
after
the
divorce
in
haiti,
the
husband,
your
client
returned
to
new
york
where
he
has
lived
ever
since.
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
a
military
duty.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
before
or
after
the
divorce?
justice
potter
stewart
before
the
divorce.
justice
potter
stewart
she
personally
or
did
her
lawyer?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
she
obtained
the
decree
in
haiti.
justice
potter
stewart
he
returned
from
where?
justice
potter
stewart
he
continued
to
reside
in
new
york.
justice
potter
stewart
at
that
time,
also
were
the
children?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
real
question
is
did
the
california
court
have
personal
jurisdiction
over
your
client
in
this
case?
that
is
the
issue?
justice
potter
stewart
page
7
of
the
appendix
which
contains
the
complaint,
paragraph
4
of
the
complaint
clearly
asks
for
the
court
to
award
money
to
the
plaintiff
against
the
defendant,
does
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
the
question
is
did
the
court
have
jurisdiction?
that
is
the
question
we
have.
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
could
the
court
assert
jurisdiction
over
your
client?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
stotter,
earlier
you
mentioned
there
might
be
a
difference
between
jurisdiction
to
award
a
money
judgment
and
jurisdiction
to
determine
custody.
paragraph
3
of
the
complaint
asked
just
for
the
modification
of
the
decree
to
award
permanent
custody
to
the
wife.
paragraph
4
is
the
one
that
asks
for
money.
do
you
concede
that
there
is
jurisdiction
to
grant
the
relief
provided
in
paragraph
3?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
relief
prayed
for
on
the
paragraph
would
result
in
a
modification
of
the
decree
of
the
settlement
agreement
between
the
parties,
would
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
it
almost
would
follow
inevitably
under
this
settlement
as
i
understand
it
that
there
would
be
some
increase
in
the
support
money
because
the
support
under
the
agreement
was
calculated
on
the
basis
of
temporary
time
with
the
wife.
was
that
not
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
can
a
california
court
constitutionally
order
your
client
to
pay
money?
that
is
the
point,
based
upon
his
relationships
with
the
states
such
as
they
are.
there
is
no
conflict
to
the
facts,
as
i
understand.
justice
potter
stewart
he
was
served
in
this
litigation?
justice
potter
stewart
in
new
york?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
the
california
supreme
court
either
in
retired
justice
sullivan’s
opinion
for
the
court
or
in
justice
richardson’s
dissenting
opinion
that
the
members
of
the
court
thought
they
were
dealing
with
a
federal
constitutional
issue?
justice
potter
stewart
justice
richardson,
in
his
dissenting
opinion,
begins
by
saying
“in
my
view,
it
is
unreasonable
to
subject
petitioner
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
california
courts
under
the
circumstances
in
this
case”
and
then
he
goes
on
with
the
facts
and
so
on.
he
never
is
explicit
in
saying
that
in
his
view
it
is
unconstitutional.
justice
potter
stewart
nor
indeed
does
justice
sullivan’s
opinion
deal
with
the
question
as
though
it
is
a
constitutional
question.
justice
potter
stewart
was
it
presented
to
that
court
as
a
constitutional
question?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
not?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
presented
to
us
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
as
a
constitutional
question,
whether
california’s
construction
of
your
civil
practice
act
extending
in
personam
jurisdiction
over
the
non-resident
appellant
violates
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
that
was
never
presented
to
the
california
supreme
court?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
is
a
matter
of
fact,
not
a
matter
of
somebody’s
position.
justice
potter
stewart
he
was
in
new
york
when
he
wrote
the
letter?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
say
writing
a
letter
to
somebody
in
california
is
activity
in
california
of
a
kind
that
would
submit
you
to
the
jurisdiction
of
a
california
court
and
to
order
you
to
pay
money?
justice
potter
stewart
mrs.
thorn,
i
think
you
were
before
lunch
going
to
start
to
address
when
we
interrupted
you,
your
point
as
to
the
fact
that
your
claim
at
least
that
the
husband
in
this
case
waived
his
claim
by
making
a
general
appearance.
were
you
going
to
do
that?
justice
potter
stewart
you
can
do
it
whenever
you
wish
in
the
course
of
your
argument,
but
i
would
be
interested
in
what
you
have
to
say
on
that
issue.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
the
appendix
of
the
green
brief?
