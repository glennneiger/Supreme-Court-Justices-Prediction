justice

you
do
not
suggest
there
is
not
a
federal
question
then.
it
is
just
one
on
which
it
is
not
a
proper
appeal
and
we
should
deny
certiorari?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
what
you
are
suggesting?
justice
byron
r.
white
mrs.
thorn,
does
the
california
supreme
court
not
expressly
say
that
the
limits
of
the
statute
are
defined
by
the
constitution?
in
page
v
of
the
jurisdictional
statement,
it
points
out
that
the
court
of
the
state
may
exercise
jurisdiction
on
any
basis
not
in
consistent
with
the
constitution
of
this
state
or
the
united
states
and
later,
that
the
case
of
the
statute
as
construed
manifest
an
intent
that
the
courts
of
california
utilize
all
such
basis
limited
only
by
constitutional
consideration?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
court
not
necessarily
decide
the
constitutional
question
when
it
decided
there
was
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
not
claim
though
that
california
would
have
jurisdiction
or
would
you,
if
custody
was
litigated
in
the
divorce
court
and
custody
was
awarded
to
the
mother?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
everybody
knew
she
lived
in
california
and
the
father
was
ordered
to
pay
and
mail
to
california
$300
a
month
for
child
support.
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
give
you
another
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
mother
now
moves
to
oregon
and
wants
more
money,
files
a
suit
in
oregon
and
the
father
has
never
said
a
thing
about
oregon.
is
there
jurisdiction
in
the
oregon
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
mrs.
thorn,
i
am
still
not
sure
you
answered
my
question.
i
do
not
know
if
you
did
or
not.
would
the
alternative
case
words
in
the
settlement
agreement
itself
be
stronger
or
weaker
in
your
view
where
there
is
as
settlement
agreement
between
the
husband
and
the
wife
provide
that
the
children
shall
reside
in
california
with
the
mother?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
will
pay
support.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
stronger
for
jurisdiction
in
california?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
supreme
court
said
that
as
to
the
boy,
but
what
the
father
did
would
not
subject
the
father
to
in
personam
jurisdiction.
did
it
not
so
hold
that
they
finally
brought
him
on
the
increase
support
order,
but
had
there
only
been
the
boy,
apparently
there
would
not
have
been
an
in
personam
jurisdiction
sustained?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
urge
this
ground
in
the
state
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
mrs.
thorn,
in
your
footnote
on
page
11
of
your
brief,
you
end
up
by
saying
â€œthere
is
no
personal
appearance
as
long
as
the
court
is
not
asked
to
exercise
jurisdiction
on
the
merits.
did
your
opponent
ask
the
court
to
exercise
jurisdiction
on
the
merits?
he
asked
them
not
to
do
that,
did
he
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
asked
them
not
to
decide
the
merits.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
not
a
request
for
decision
on
the
merits.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
just
the
opposite.
is
your
a
california
case
squarely
supporting
you
on
this?
your
authority
seems,
to
me,
to
be
against
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
footnote
3,
page
11,
they
seem
to
all
be
against
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
everything
in
hawaii.
