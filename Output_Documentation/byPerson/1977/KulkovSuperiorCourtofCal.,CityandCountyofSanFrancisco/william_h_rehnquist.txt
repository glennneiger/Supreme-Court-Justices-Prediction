justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
mother
in
this
case
sought
in
personam
money
judgment
against
your
client,
did
she
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
did
the
mother
seek
in
her
action
in
the
superior
court
of
california?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
is
an
in
personam
money
judgment.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
answer
to
that
question
may
turn
on
whether
simply
on
the
adjustment
of
custody
was
sought
or
whether
an
in
personam
money
judgment
was
sought,
may
or
not,
it
may
differ?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
are
you
also
saying
it
is
not
a
substantial
federal
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
would
think
of
justice
white’s
question
and
the
chief
justice’s
question
posed
two
quite
different
inquiries.
one
is
whether
it
is
the
kind
of
case
that
would
occur
frequently
that
this
court
would
want
to
exercise
discretionary
jurisdiction
over,
and
the
other
is
whether
there
is
any
substantial
federal
claim
here
at
all
even
though
the
case
is
a
real
sport.
is
your
answer
to
both
of
those
questions
no
or
both
yes?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
can
conceive
of
a
case
where
there
might
be
a
very
substantial
constitutional
claim
in
the
sense
that
a
party
litigant
has
had
a
constitutional
right
violated
and
yet
nonetheless
one
would
say
it
is
a
set
of
facts
that
is
never
going
to
recur
and
this
court
only
takes
150
cases
a
year
and
we
simply
would
not
grant
certiorari
in
a
case
like
that,
but
if
it
were
an
appeal
as
of
right,
we
would
probably
not
feel
free
to
say
there
was
no
substantial
federal
question.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
that
there
really
is
not
any
really
doubtful
federal
question
in
the
case
even
though
it
was
to
recur
time
and
again.
it
should
be
resolved
in
favor
of
state
jurisdiction.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mrs.
thorn,
i
think
it
was
some-40
or
50
years
ago
that
this
court
decided
a
case
in
which
it
said
that
one
could
pay
a
judgment
rendered
against
him
by
the
highest
court
of
a
state
and
not
supersede
it
or
nonetheless
pursue
an
appeal
here
without
the
case
becoming
moot.
do
you
see
much
difference
between
that
situation
and
the
situation
you
have
just
described?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
there
not
be
a
federal
element
in
this
court’s
decision
as
to
whether
the
petitioner
or
appellant
is
free
to
pursue
his
remedy
by
way
of
appeal
here
and
nonetheless
protect
what
he
conceives
to
be
his
pending
interest
in
the
state
trial
court
while
we
have
the
appeal
before
us?
