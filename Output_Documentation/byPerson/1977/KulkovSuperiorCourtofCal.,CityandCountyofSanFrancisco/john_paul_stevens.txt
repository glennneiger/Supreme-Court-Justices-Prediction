justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
about
that.
suppose
that
the
settlement
agreement
here
had
given
the
custody
to
the
parents
and,
at
the
time,
the
lady
was
residing
in
california,
which
she
was.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there
was
a
consensual
agreement
that
would
be
embodied
in
the
decree
that
the
wife
would
have
custody.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
by
consent,
under
this
agreement,
the
children
would
be
residing
with
the
ex-wife
in
california
and
there
is
an
agreed
upon
amount
for
support
and
then
the
wife
sues
in
california
to
increase
support
and
serves
the
husband
in
new
york
jurisdiction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
would
it
be
different?
the
husband
has
in
advance
agreed
to
take
advantage
of
california
law.
well,
all
i
am
bringing
it
up
for
is,
i
would
think
it
would
recur
time
and
time
again,
this
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
may
be
so,
but
what
does
that
got
to
do
with
jurisdiction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
fact,
the
analysis
of
the
california
court
was
whether
international
shoe
or
hanson
v.
denckla
required
a
different
result.
those
are
federal
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you
go
to
that,
since
we
have
got
you
interrupted
anyway,
let
me
be
sure
i
understand
your
position.
suppose
we
have
two
different
cases.
one,
the
case
we
actually
have
and
a
second
case
in
which
the
settlement
agreement
itself
that
said
the
children
shall
be
in
the
custody
of
the
mother
who
shall
reside
in
california.
that
is
all
it
said
and
it
had
agreed
upon
an
amount
and
then
thereafter
the
mother
brought
suit
to
increase
the
support
allowance.
would
that
be
a
stronger
or
a
weaker
case
for
jurisdiction
in
california
under
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there
would
have
been
a
clear
consent
to
the
children
being
there
unambiguous
and
all
that
and
he
paid
the
tickets
in
my
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
zobel
v.
zobel,
that
is
it,
i
guess.
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
request
for
a
continuance
to
plead
to
the
merits,
but
they
did
not
ask
for
a
continuance
to
plead
to
the
merits.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
not
continuance
to
plead
to
the
merits.
he
did
not
ask
for
more
time
to
answer,
in
other
words.
he
maintained
his
position
all
along
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
to
decide
the
merits,
whereas,
the
case
you
cite
is
the
one
that
ask
for
a
continuance
so
he
can
file
an
answer
directed
at
the
merits
which
is
quite
different.
