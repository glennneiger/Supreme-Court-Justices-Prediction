mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
in
an
action
for
child
support
in
the
state
of
california
as
a
consequence
of
the
departure
of
two
children
from
the
custody
of
their
father
in
the
home
that
they
had
enjoyed
all
of
their
lives
in
the
state
of
new
york.
the
matter
comes
before
you
as
a
final
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
california
under
california
rules
which
permit
us
to
bifurcate
issues
of
jurisdiction
and
challenge
those
up
through
the
courts,
which
is
done
by
a
writ
of
mandate
and
was
done
in
this
case.
we
submit
that
this
court
has
jurisdiction
by
virtue
of
the
nature
of
the
california
statute
which
is
involved
in
this
particular
case.
in
particular
this
particular
statute
states
a
court
of
this
state
may
exercise
jurisdiction
on
any
basis
not
inconsistent
with
the
constitution
of
this
state
and/or
of
the
united
states.
in
the
legislative
judicial
council
comments,
the
legislature
adapted
the
statement
that
the
sufficiency
of
such
context
is
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
on
which
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
has
the
final
voice.
so
as
a
consequence
in
this
particular
action
before
you,
there
is
almost
a
co-existence
between
the
construction
of
the
statute
and
its
application.
i
might
submit
to
the
court
that
i
think
there
is
a
question
with
respect
to
the
omnibus
type
of
statute
in
terms
of
it
being
an
improper
delegation
of
the
legislative
duty
to
the
courts
or
possibly
even
vagueness,
but
that
has
not
been
the
approach
raised
by
the
appellant
in
this
case.
the
approach
in
this
particular
case
is
how
the
statute
is
applied
as
being
unconstitutional
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
also
submit
that
the
issue
of
mootness
raised
by
the
appellee
is
not
appropriate
in
this
case
because
in
fact,
in
each
case
at
each
level
this
was
raised
solely
on
special
appearance
to
challenge
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
the
trial
court
so
found
at
each
level
that
this
was
an
issue
of
special
appearance
even
after
the
proceedings.
the
trial
court
found
that
we
had
appeared
only
by
special
appearance
and
i
might
add
that
in
the
titus
case
cited
by
us,
the
specific
act
of
advising
the
court
after
it
had
already
denied
a
motion
to
quash
that
the
matter
was
going
up
on
appeal
and
did
not
have
jurisdiction
was
found
by
the
appellate
court
to
not
constitute
an
appearance
at
that
time.
lastly,
your
honors,
we
submit
that
the
issue
of
mootness
is
inappropriate
in
a
situation
or
in
a
society
in
which
there
has
generally
been
an
attitude
of
expanding
jurisdiction.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
certainly,
justice
blackmun.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
no,
sir
and
that
was
the
decree
in
which
the
appellee
moved
to
be
established
in
california
in
the
initial
action
filed
in
california.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
i
do,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
yes,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
i
think,
justice
blackmun,
that
there
is
enough
authority
both
in
new
york
and
in
california
that
these
parties
would
be
estopped
to
take
a
position
inconsistent
with
their
joint
acts
in
going
to
haiti.
therefore,
i
certainly
would
not
have
advised
that
by
my
client
and
i
would
imagine
the
other
side
would
take
the
same
position.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
yes,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
yes,
sir.
lastly,
as
i
was
saying,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
many
of
the
commentators
seem
to
suggest
that
the
test
issues
of
jurisdiction
we
should
not
be
engaged
in
a
type
of
wager
at
law
in
which
we
act
at
our
payroll
in
trying
to
test
out
jurisdiction.
certainly,
the
attempt
here
and
in
no
case
was
there
ever
an
attempt
by
the
appellant
to
deal
with
the
merits.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
yes,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
precisely.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
i
think
so.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
the
appellant,
ezra
kulko
differs
materially
from
the
type
of
parties
which
have
generally
been
before
this
court,
in
state
court
jurisdiction
cases
relating
the
non-residents.
we
have
here
an
average
citizen
family
man
engaged
in
common
family
interactions.
he
is
not
a
corporation.
he
is
not
involved
in
doing
business
or
acts
for
economic
benefits
such
as
generally
all
of
the
cases
that
in
the
past
have
been
involved.
this
is
the
type
of
individual
that
strikes
all
across
the
breadth
of
this
country’s
activities,
from
the
penthouse
to
the
ghetto
there
are
people
engaging
in
the
split
of
their
family
and
entering
into
marital
settlement
agreements
of
the
type
engaged
in
this
particular
case.
i
submit
that
the
activities
of
this
particular
party
or
both
of
these
parties
are
acts
that
are
going
on
by
thousands
of
citizens
across
the
country
monthly,
if
not
weekly.
second,
dr.
kolko
in
this
case
is
both
a
resident
and
a
domiciliary
of
the
state
of
new
york.
he
was
born,
educated,
married,
established
his
home
there
and
for
all
intents
and
purposes
with
a
few
exceptions,
has
never
left
the
state.
he
is
not
the
typical
father
who
has
departed
from
the
domicile
state
in
order
to
escape
his
obligations.
he
has
remained
in
the
state
of
the
marital
domicile.
in
this
particular
case,
on
the
contrary,
it
is
the
appellee,
the
wife
who
has
departed
from
the
domicile
state
and
who
has
obtained
an
essence
to
use
what
some
of
the
commentators
talk
about
as
the
migratory
or
suitcase
divorce
with
the
consent
of
the
husband.
in
addition,
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
each
of
the
two
children
at
2-year-intervals
also
departed
from
the
state
of
new
york
and
from
the
residence
of
the
father
by
their
own
choice.
now
in
addition,
we
have
here
a
recognition
that
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
mrs.
horn’s
complaint
the
father
was
the
legal
custodian
of
both
of
these
two
children
by
virtue
of
a
marital
settlement
agreement
which
if
your
honors
please
was
negotiated,
prepared,
executed
and
carried
out
in
the
state
of
new
york
by
mrs.
horn’s
attorney,
dr.
horn
not
being
represented
by
choice
and
which
mrs.
horn
flew
from
california
to
new
york
in
order
to
execute
and
complete
the
negotiations
at
that
particular
time.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
the
decree
was
entered
in
haiti,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
if
i
said
decree,
then
i
stand
corrected.
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
i
think
the
facts,
mr.
chief
justice,
of
new
york
domicile
is
important
in
this
case,
but
not
for
the
traditional
reasons
that
there
was
a
decree
entered
in
new
york,
but
simply
because
the
facts
and
circumstances
relating
to
the
parties
and
their
agreement
as
negotiated
in
new
york
gives
a
great
deal
of
importance
to
the
ties
that
new
york
would
give
to
its
contracts
and
certainly
to
its
negotiated
marital
settlement
agreements.
it
is
significant,
i
submit,
that
it
was
mrs.
kulko
who
departed
from
new
york
to
obtain
the
decree
and
subsequently
was
married
in
the
state
of
california.
under
circumstances,
which
based
upon
her
residence
in
california,
she
could
have
at
the
time
obtained
the
typical
type
of
no
fault
divorce
or
dissolution
allowed
by
california,
but
she
chose
instead
to
come
east
and
go
through
the
arrangements
at
that
particular
time.
so
she
had
the
option
at
that
time
of
getting
jurisdiction
in
the
state
of
california.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
i
am
sorry,
justice
marshall?
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
that
is
correct.
she
preferred
to
have
the
arrangements
that
could
be
made
at
that
time
in
new
york.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
we
are
talking
about
at
the
time
of
the
marital
settlement
agreement
and
the
haitian
decree
which
took
place
only
in
a
matter
of
days
separating
each
other.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
that
is
correct,
at
all
times.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
up
to
the
time
of
their
separation.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
it
ran
this
way.
the
parties
and
the
family
always
lived
in
new
york.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
the
wife
departed
from
the
family
leaving
the
father
and
the
children
in
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
before.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
she
went
to
california.
they
then
entered
into
a
marital
settlement
agreement,
all
of
which
took
place
in
new
york,
all
aspects
of
it.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
first,
her
lawyer
negotiated
and
then
she
personally
came
from
california
to
new
york
to
execute
the
agreement
and
then
left
from
new
york,
she
did,
to
go
to
haiti
with
consent
of
the
doctor.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
she
obtained
the
decree
of
haiti
and
then
she
returned
to
california
and
the
father
returned
to
the
family
home
where
the
children
were
which
he
had
never
departed.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
i
am
sorry,
the
father
never
left.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
yes,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
i
will
in
a
moment,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
i
think
that
the
court
should
recognize
that
one
of
the
major
issues
involved
here
is
whether
the
context
required
to
establish
personal
jurisdiction
under
international
shoe
should
be
of
more
substantial
type
or
nature
in
domestic
or
family
law
proceedings
than
those
existing
in
other
cases.
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
this
is
made
particularly
clear
by
the
restatement
of
section
37.
in
the
restatement,
your
honors,
section
37
which
deals
with
the
question
of
doing
an
act
having
an
effect
elsewhere,
they
talk
about
three
things:
intent,
foreseeability
and
no
intent.
when
one
reads,
all
of
the
statements
made
by
the
commissioners
in
intent
we
are
talking
about
the
shooting
of
a
missile
or
a
bullet,
in
foreseeability
we
are
talking
about
allowing
your
car
to
be
driven
by
somebody
else
across
state
lines
or
putting
explosives
that
might
have
an
effect.
none
of
this
type
of
circumstances
were
clearly
contemplated
by
the
commissioners
when
they
adapted
this
particular
type
of
criteria.
significantly,
in
the
caveat
to
this
restatement,
they
talk
about
defamation
possibly
being
an
exception
that
should
be
handled
differently
with
more
substantial
types
of
matters
raising
in
essence
question
of
free
speech.
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
in
this
particular
case
the
question
of
invasion
of
privacy,
the
decision
of
the
rights
of
a
family
to
decide
where
their
children
should
live
is
significantly
appropriate.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
well,
if
your
honor
please,
california
had
two
lower
court
cases,
both
of
which
rejected
the
concept
that
these
type
of
acts
were
essentially
the
type
of
acts
that
were
contemplated
by
this
type
of
a
criteria.
it
is
our
contention
that
dr.
kulko
really
passively
went
along
with
the
daughter
who
decided
that
she
wanted
to
come
to
california.
we
submit,
if
your
honors
look,
that
in
the
pleadings
here,
paragraph
10
of
the
original
complaint
filed
in
here
makes
a
specific
allegation
that
the
father
threatens
to
remove
the
children
from
the
state
of
california
and
asks
for
a
restraining
order.
at
that
particular
time,
when
the
original
pleading
was
filed,
the
trial
court
issued
a
restraining
order
against
the
removal
of
both
of
those
children
so
that
we
submit
that
suggestions
made
by
the
california
supreme
court
that
this
was
a
voluntary
act
or
a
consent
by
the
father
to
send
his
children
into
the
state
of
california
is
untrue.
what
we
are
involved
with
is
a
situation
where
--
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
yes,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
not
in
the
traditional
situation,
your
honors.
let
me
put
it
this
way.
we
have
here
a
considerate
concerned
father
who
was
attempting
to
workout
in
the
family
interaction,
what
would
be
the
best
solution
for
the
children.
on
the
other
side,
if
we
would
place
a
father
who
was
abstinent,
who
would
not
pay
anything,
who
would
not
cooperate,
i
think
this
court
would
therefore
say
that
the
non-cooperative
litigant
type
father
have
done
no
acts,
and
therefore,
not
be
subject
to
jurisdiction,
but
the
father
who
was
facing
reality
and
who
says
when
the
daughters“i
want
to
live
with
my
mother,”
“okay,
if
that
is
your
choice.
i
think
you
are
wrong,
but
i
will
buy
you
a
ticket
and
wish
you
well.”
the
court
in
california
was
saying
that
is
a
type
of
act
conferring
jurisdiction.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
there
were
no
proceedings
relative
to
any
action
filed
by
the
mother
at
any
time
in
the
state
of
new
york
or
anywhere
else
claiming
that
the
father
was
indebted
to
her
for
some
act
or
acts.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
the
mother
sought
only
to
establish
the
haitian
decree
and
to
establish
child
support
perspectively.
this
was
not
an
action
to
--
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
that
is
correct.
she
is
asking
for
an
in
personam
money
judgment
in
the
future.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
and
also
custody
which
we
did
not
contest.
so
the
issue
comes
before
the
court
solely
on
her
right
to
seek
through
california
courts
a
larger
sum
of
money.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
that
is
the
very
bottom
issue.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
it
does
differ.
traditionally,
the
courts
have
viewed
questions
of
custody
as
relating
solely
to
issues
of
status.
they
have
viewed
questions
of
money
judgment
as
being
a
type
of
in
personam
jurisdiction
of
type
which
in
vanderbilt
this
court
ruled
would
not
apply
as
far
as
alimony
is
concerned.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
yes,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
the
position
of
the
appellant
is
no,
because
the
appellant
has
absolutely
no
contact
with
the
state
of
california,
in
any
respect,
has
never
entered
the
california,
in
any
circumstance
was
not
doing
business,
did
not
do
an
intentional
act
of
the
type
which
this
court
has
found
applies
in
the
economic
sphere
in
other
types
of
cases.
we
are
involved
in
this
particular
case
with
the
interaction
between
families
and
which
we
submit,
would
have
a
very
counter-effect
when
families
are
left
with
the
decision
that
by
being
cooperative
they
would,
thereby
be
conferring
jurisdiction.
we
just
do
not
feel
that
that
measures
up
to
the
standards
which
this
court
has
submitted
in
the
past.
i
might
add
that
another
aspect
of
this
relates
to
the
question
of
the
foreseeability
type
of
circumstances
in
which
justice
stevens
mentioned
in
the
shaffer
case
in
which
he
equates
fair
notice
to
include
fair
warning.
i
submit
that
as
a
general
rule,
parents
deciding
that
allowing
their
children
who
have
asked
to
go
with
another
parent
do
not,
thereby,
have
knowledge
or
aware
of
the
fact
that
they
are
conferring
jurisdiction
in
a
court
3,000
miles
away
to
decide
how
much
money
they
may
have
to
pay
in
the
future.
i
also
submit
to
the
court
the
question
that
ordinarily
one
thinks
in
terms
of
the
state’s
right
to
protect
the
children
that
are
within
its
domicile.
in
this
particular
case,
there
is
no
determination
that
the
amount
of
money
awarded
in
new
york
might
not
already
have
been
sufficient
and
that
it
really
would
be
a
question
of
just
how
well
the
children
should
live.
under
those
particular
circumstances,
it
is
not
a
decision
that
these
children
were
somehow
going
to
be
thrown
into
poverty.
we
have
the
uniform
reciprocal
support
act
and
the
right
of
the
mother,
as
she
did
at
the
time
of
the
marital
settlement
agreement,
to
come
back
to
new
york
and
in
the
first
instance
have
new
york
settle
her
particular
money
problems.
in
this
particular
case,
she
judiciously
chose
to
avoid
new
york
presumably
because
she
felt
that
she
would
not
be
treated
well
in
new
york
because
essentially
she
had
abandoned
new
york.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
yes,
sir.
i
do
not
quarrel
with
the
test.
i
quarrel
with
the
fact
he
purposely
--
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
not
as
a
fact.
it
seems
to
me
a
court
does
have
a
concern
relative
to
the
choice
of
law,
question
of
protecting
children
--
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
justice
brennan,
the
question
of
the
purposeful
nature,
i
guess,
is
the
factual
question
which,
under
this
particular
statute,
is
submitted
to
this
particular
court.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
no,
sir.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
inappropriate
to
do
so
and
as
a
consequence,
it
seems
that
to
place
the
father
in
a
position
where
he
must
act
at
his
peril
in
making
the
kite
type
of
act
which
one
would
presume
that
any
concerned
father
would
make
when
confronted
with
the
decision
by
a
young
child
that
says
“i
want
to
go
with
my
mother.”
now,
having
this
be
the
state
of
the
marital
domicile,
under
all
circumstances,
this
particular
father
had
two
choices.
either
he
was
to
litigate,
deny
the
request
of
the
child
and
enter
into
litigation
in
new
york
or
force
litigation
in
new
york
or
cooperate
in
terms
of
allowing
the
child
to
go
live
with
the
mother
and
i
submit
that
that
is
not
the
type
of
purposeful
activity
for
obtaining
the
privileges
and
benefits
in
the
state
of
california
which
this
court
has
generally
treated
in
the
past.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
that
is
correct,
justice
brennan.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
no,
justice
brennan.
they
made
the
decision
to
the
effect
that
while
they
recognize
there
was
no
contact
since
they
already
had
contact
with
the
daughter
and
since
they
felt
the
jurisdiction
of
the
father
was
established
by
virtue
of
his
single
act
of
buying
that
ticket
they,
therefore,
said
“we
therefore
will
also
apply
it
to
the
son
as
well.”
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
they
basically
say
that
he
consented
to
the
son
because
he
did
not
commence
an
immediate
action
even
though
at
the
time
he
was
under
a
restraining
order
from
the
state
of
california
against
removing
those
children.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
no,
sir.
it
was
a
one-way
ticket.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
he
had
hoped
that
the
child
would
recognize
that
life
with
the
mother
would
not
be
as
ideal
as
she
thought
it
would
be
and
that
by
giving
her
an
opportunity
for
her
day
in
california,
so
to
speak,
she
would
see
that
life
in
california
was
not
as
good
as
life
in
new
york.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
i
think
the
child
would
simply
have
called
the
father
and
said
much
the
same
way
“i
would
like
to
come
back
to
new
york,”
and
a
ticket
instantly
would
have
been
available.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
yes.
we
had
conceded
that
for
purposes
of
the
proceedings
that
we
brought
and
we
at
the
trial
court
level
raised
questions
that
the
uniform
child
custody
jurisdiction
act
certainly
as
to
darwin
would
not
apply.
on
the
other
hand,
it
was
the
advice
of
counsel,
myself,
in
this
case
that
the
decision
of
a
child
of
this
age
would
certainly
be
very
persuasive
on
a
court.
therefore,
the
issue
of
jurisdiction
should
not
be
challenged
on
that
issue.
the
question
of
custody
was
not
raised
and
i
think
that
there
is
not
issue
here
relative
to
the
custody
question.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
that
is
correct.
i
think
custody
is
a
type
of
status
which
can
be
handled
totally
different.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
that
is
correct
and
relief
in
terms
of
custody
might
well
be
granted
without
getting
into
money
judgments
at
all.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
i
think
there
is
no
question
about
the
fact
that
both
california
and
new
york,
as
a
choice
of
law
issue,
would
have
recognized
that
these
children
were
entitled
to
support.
the
issue
is,
can
california
make
these
determinations
as
to
what
the
father
should
pay
as
distinguished
from
her
going
back
to
new
york
and
the
marital
domicile
which
is
generally
been
very
highly
respected
in
family
law
proceedings,
in
which
great
importance
has
always
been
stressed
in
order
to
determine
what
the
amount
of
child
support
should
be.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
justice
stewart,
i
think
that
is
correct.
the
answer
that
we
contend
on
the
basis
of
a
single
act
is
of
a
type
of
act
done
in
this
particular
case
and
not
of
the
type
of
acts
done
in
the
typical
economic
type
of
cases.
thank
you.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
briefly,
the
california
supreme
court
specifically
found
that
there
was
no
knowledge
by
the
father
of
darwin’s
departure.
number
two,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
in
the
appendix
to
the
brief,
the
court
specifically
finds
that
only
a
special
appearance
was
made.
number
three,
on
page
38.
mr.
lawrence
h.
stotter
the
green
brief,
the
court
specifically
finds
only
a
special
appearance.
in
the
appendix
in
my
motion
to
writ
of
mandate
rather
at
page
38
is
specifically
set
forth
the
challenges
to
the
constitution
of
the
particular
code
section
in
question
and
i
sight
pennoyer
v.
neff,
international
shoe,
the
titus,
etcetera
in
response
to
earlier
questions.
in
conclusion,
let
me
submit
that
in
the
search
for
fair
play
and
substantial
justice
in
all
the
cases
that
cite
when
we
go
back
to
mcdonald
v.
maybe
(ph),
justice
holmes
indicated
“in
states
bound
together
by
a
constitution
and
subject
to
the
fourteenth
amendment,
great
caution
should
be
used
not
to
let
fiction
deny
the
fair
play
that
can
be
secured
only
by
pretty
close
adhesion
to
the
fact.”
under
circumstances
where
this
court
has
already
found
mechanical
and
quantitative
evaluations,
it
should
not
be
a
determination
to
say
that
buying
one
airplane
ticket
is
sufficient
to
make
this
type
of
connection.
it
seems
to
me
as
going
the
other
way
from
what
this
court
has
previously
said.
thank
you,
sirs.
