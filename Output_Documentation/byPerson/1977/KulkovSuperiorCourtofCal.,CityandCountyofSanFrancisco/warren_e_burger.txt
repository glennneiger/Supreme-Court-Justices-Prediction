chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
kulko
against
the
superior
court
of
california.
mr.
stotter,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
getting
me
a
little
bit
confused.
where
was
the
decree
entered?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
in
new
york?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
just
want
to
be
clear.
you
seem
to
be
now
arguing
new
york
domicile
when
both
parties
consented
to
the
divorce
in
another
place.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
here
attacking
the
judgment
of
california
and
i
think
it
would
be
very
helpful
to
us,
it
certainly
would
be
to
me,
if
you
would
tell
me
what
it
is
that
is
wrong
about
californiaâ€™s
assertion
of
jurisdiction
based
upon
their
contact
with
the
children
and
the
wife?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
want
us
to
decide
the
factual
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mrs.
thorn?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
difference
does
it
make?
no
one
is
challenging
the
decree
now,
are
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
the
california
supreme
court
not
place
the
rather
long-arm
jurisdiction
here
on
the
proposition
that
he
in
effect
sent
the
children
and
submitted
them
to
the
custody
of
the
state
of
california
and
all
its
protections?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
would
not
apply
as
he
has
never
done
that
with
respect
to
oregon.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oregon
could
not
have
any
jurisdiction
over
him.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
at
1:00.
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
it
is
moot
in
california
and
it
is
moot
here,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
on
the
fall
back
position
anyway?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
would
be
the
same
in
new
jersey,
too,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
believe
your
time
has
expired,
mrs.
thorn.
you
have
one
minute
remaining,
mr.
stotter.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
marshall.
