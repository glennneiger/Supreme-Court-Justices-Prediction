not
a
consent?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did

justice
thurgood

a
little
different
from
what

back?
justice
thurgood
marshall

answer
to
my
question
is
how

back,
walk?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
holding
of
courts,
talking
about
the
lower
court’s
holding,
accords
with
established
due
process
principles.
i
am
quoting
from
page
8
of
your
motion
to
affirm.
you
recognized
it,
did
you
not?

run
away
from
the
father?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
you
urge
it
in
your
motion
to
dismiss

this
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
want
to
borrow
my
copy?
justice
thurgood
marshall
another
thing
is
what
law
determines,
california
law
or
federal
law?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
were
the
one
who
was
raising
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
what
is
before
us?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
what
is
before
us.
it
is
the
supreme
court’s
judgment
and
opinion.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
sought
a
nunc
pro
tunc,
makes
it
moot
before?
justice
thurgood
marshall
a
party
comes
in
and
says,
“i
want
a
continuance
in
order
to
file
a
special
appearance.”
would
that
be
a
general
appearance?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
will
i
find
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
did
not
appeal
on
that
and
you
are
not
either?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
far
as
i
am
concerned,
how
does
that
get
into
record?
it
is
after
judgment.
is
it
not
after
judgment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
if
your
client
had
moved
to
hawaii,
would
you
make
the
same
argument?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
i
just
want
to
move
it
a
little
further.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
is
all
the
way
across
the
country.
justice
thurgood
marshall
just
exactly
instead
of
california
and
she
kept
on
going.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
everything
else
is
the
same.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said
everything
was
in
hawaii.
she
went
to
hawaii.
the
children
went
to
hawaii.
you
filed
your
lawsuit
in
hawaii.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
other
case,
kulko
against
the
california
superior
court
and
this
case
was
initially
filed
as
an
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
california.
we
postponed
probable
jurisdiction.
in
this
case,
the
appellant
married
appellee
in
california
in
1959
while
on
a
brief
military
stop
over.
both's
bosses
were
new
york
domiciliaries
at
that
time.
following
the
appellant's
return
from
military
service,
the
couple
resided
together
in
new
york,
where
their
two
children
were
born.
they
separated
in
1972
and
executed
a
separation
agreement
in
new
york,
providing
that
the
children
would
spend
the
school
year
in
new
york
with
the
appellant
and
their
vacations
in
california
with
the
appellee.
in
december
of
1973,
appellant's
daughter
decided
that
she
wanted
to
spend
the
school
year
in
california
with
the
mother
and
appellant
does
send
her
to
california.
with
this
act
that
the
california
court
believed,
wanted
the
exercise
of
in
person
on
jurisdiction.
in
our
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
dismiss
the
appeal,
grant
certiorari
and
reverse.
the
due
process
clause
prohibits
the
state
to
exercise
personal
jurisdiction
over
a
non-resident
defendant
only
where
there
are
minimum
contacts
between
the
defendant
and
the
state
that
makes
it
very
unreasonable
to
require
him
to
the
defend
an
action
in
that
state's
court.
the
mere
act
of
acquiescing
in
the
child
desire
to
spend
more
time
with
her
mother
is
simply
not
sufficient
to
meet
the
standard
where
the
defendant
has
no
other
relevant
contacts
that
the
forum
stated.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
justice
powell
joined.
