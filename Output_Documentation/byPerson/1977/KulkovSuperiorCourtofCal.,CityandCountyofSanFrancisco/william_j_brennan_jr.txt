mr.
stotter,
is
not
the
issue
we
have
to
decide
whether
dr.
kulko
did
anything
in
california
that
subjected
him
to
in
personam
jurisdiction
in
united
states,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
are
you
going
to
get
to
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
time
is
running
out.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
also
custody
of
the
children.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
stotter,
i
suggest
that
what
she
did
or
did
not
do
is
not
relevant
to
the
question
we
have
to
decide.
we
have
to
decide
whether
what
he
did,
as
the
california
supreme
court
held,
suffice
to
subject
him
in
personam
jurisdiction
in
california
and
you
quarrel
with
the
test
that
the
california
supreme
court
laid
down?
did
he
purposely
availed
himself
of
the
benefits
and
protections
of
california
laws
or
anticipate
that
he
would
derive
an
economic
benefit
result
of
his
act
outside
of
california?
do
you
quarrel
with
that
test?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
with
its
application?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
i
understand
it,
the
way
they
applied
it
was
said
that
probably
no
parental
act
more
fully
invokes
the
benefits
and
protections
of
california
law
than
that
by
which
a
parent
permits
his
minor
child
to
live
in
california.
we
start
with
a
premise
of
a
non-resident
parent
who
allows
his
minor
child
or
children
to
reside
in
california.
as
by
that
act
he
purposely
availed
himself
with
the
benefits
and
protections
of
the
laws
in
california.
do
you
quarrel
with
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
understand
it.
what
the
court
did
was,
then
go
on
to
say
is
what
he
did
in
letting
his
daughter
come
and
buying
her
the
airline
ticket
and
those
other
facts,
they
established
that
he
had
committed
an
act
in
new
york
which
had
the
effect
of
allowing
his
minor
child
or
children
to
reside
in
california
and,
thus
he
had
purposely
availed
himself
with
the
benefits
and
the
protections
of
the
laws
of
california,
and
therefore,
under
the
test
that
you
say
you
do
not
quarrel
with,
that
established
the
basis
for
in
personam
jurisdiction.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
course,
your
supreme
court
distinguished
between
the
daughter
and
son
saying
that
the
father
had
done
nothing
in
new
york
which
had
the
effect
of
committing
the
son
to
california
in
the
same
way
that
he
had
done
with
the
daughter.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
therefore,
they
refuse
to
accept
jurisdiction.
there
was
no
jurisdiction
as
to
the
increased
support
for
the
son,
but
only
as
to
the
daughter,
is
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
they
finally
wind
up
with
“we
deem
it
fair
and
reasonable
to
subject
to
him
the
personal
jurisdiction
for
this
court
for
both
children”
where
his
committed
acts
with
respect
to
one
child
confers
personal
jurisdiction
and
as
consented
to
the
permanent
residence
of
the
opposition.
you
are
right.
the
judgment
finally
entered
was
increased
support
for
both.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
did
not
involve
a
matter
of
personal
jurisdiction.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
can
still
treat
it
as
certiorari,
could
we
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
actually,
the
children’s
presence
would
certainly
be
the
effect
of
his
having
made
and
signed
that
agreement
in
new
york,
would
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
how
would
the
issue
be
any
different
than
the
one
we
have
now?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
partly
or
not,
if
your
supreme
court’s
test
whether
or
not
he
committed
the
children
to
the
benefits
of
california
law,
under
the
agreement
he
did,
did
he
not,
even
though
only
parts
of
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
the
constitutional
issue
any
different?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
suppose
california
court
would
think
that
set
of
facts
will
satisfy
the
california
test
of
something
done
outside
by
the
defendant,
if
he
resisted
the
custody
decree?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
is
an
agreement
that
may
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let
me
start
it
out.
are
you
really
asking
us
to
determine
what
constitutes
a
general
appearance
or
more
accurately
whether
the
things
that
you
are
talking
about
constituted
general
appearance
under
california
law?
how
are
we
competent
to
do
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me.
may
i
get
back
to
this
general
appearance
business?
i
gather
you
concede
that
everything
that
happened
before
in
coming
down
of
the
california
supreme
court
opinion
save
the
failure
to
move
to
stay
the
coming
down
of
that
opinion.
now
everything
that
he
did
before
that,
no
wise
prejudice,
the
special
appearance
is
even
making
through
the
superior
court,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
your
reliance
in
the
argument
that
what
he
did
constituted
general
appearance,
everything
occurred
after
the
coming
down
of
that
opinion,
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
apparently,
in
order
to
preserve
his
opportunity
to
come
to
this
court,
is
that
it?
