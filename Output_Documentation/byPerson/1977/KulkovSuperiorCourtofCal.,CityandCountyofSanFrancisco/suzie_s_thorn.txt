ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
begin
by
making
three
corrections
which
i
believe
are
relevant
to
the
facts.
dr.
kulko
was
served
in
person
and
not
by
mail
as
suggested
in
some
of
the
briefs.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
that
is
correct.
secondly
a
relevant
fact
--
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
yes,
he
was
served
personally.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
in
new
york,
yes.
secondly,
the
daughter,
elsa
was
11.5
years
old
at
the
time
that
she
asked
to
live
with
her
mother
and
her
father
participated
with
her
in
that
change
of
custody.
therefore,
to
suggest
that
it
was
a
unilateral
act
does
not
seem
appropriate.
further,
dr.
kulko
was
represented
by
an
attorney
at
the
time
of
the
new
york
settlement
agreement.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
first
to
the
question
of
jurisdiction
of
this
court
with
regard
to
this
matter.
throughout
the
entire
proceedings
through
the
california
supreme
court,
there
was
no
attack
made
on
the
california
statute
either
on
its
face
or
as
applied.
we,
therefore,
submit
that
appeal
is
not
applicable
here.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
defendant
moved
to
quash
the
summons
on
the
ground
that
the
court
lacked
personal
jurisdiction
because
he
was
a
non-resident
without
sufficient
contacts
with
california
to
satisfy
due
process
requirements.
furthermore,
the
circumstances
of
this
case
are
most
unusual
as
are
outlined
in
the
brief
for
the
appellee.
they
are
unlikely
to
occur
again
and
do
not
raise
issues
of
national
importance.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
secondly
to
the
issue
of
mootness.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
i
am
suggesting
--
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
i
am
suggesting
that
it
is
not
a
substantial
federal
question,
your
honor,
because
of
the
unique
happen
stands
of
facts
in
the
situation.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
i
think
my
answer
to
one
would
be
no.
would
you
repeat
the
second
one,
justice
rehnquist?
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
i
would
answer
yes
to
the
second
question.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
i
am
saying,
your
honor,
that
this
is
a
unique
set
of
facts
that
does
not
justify
the
court
in
assuming
jurisdiction.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
yes,
she
was.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
correct.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
i
think
that
raises
a
different
case.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
i
would
answer
that
by
saying,
in
this
case,
we
had
a
substantial
change
in
the
status
of
the
children
after
the
making
of
the
agreement.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
i
think
it
has
to
do
with
the
reasonableness
of
the
contacts
which
led
the
california
supreme
court
to
feel
that
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction
was
reasonable
in
this
case.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
i
think
they
felt
they
were
dealing
with
the
application
of
code
of
civil
procedure.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
that
is
correct,
justice
stewart.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
that
is
correct.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
no,
it
was
not,
justice
stewart.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
it
was
not
presented
as
a
constitutional
question.
it
was
presented
as
to
whether
or
not
this
particular
case
fell
into
the
statute,
california
code
of
civil
procedure
1410.10.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
that
is
our
position,
justice
stewart.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
that
is
a
matter
of
fact,
justice
stewart.
it
was
not
presented
that
way
to
the
california
supreme
court.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
that
is
correct.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
i
think
it
was
inferring
that
decision
was
limited
by
constitutional
perimeters,
but
that
it
was
not
really
construing
it
as
the
constitution
in
this
particular
situation.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
i
think
it
would
be
fair
to
say
that,
justice
marshall.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
that
is
correct,
justice
stevens.
i
would
like
to
move
to
the
issue
of
mootness,
if
i
may.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
well,
it
would
be
weaker
in
the
sense
that
there
would
have
been
less
acts
by
the
father
causing
an
effect.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
it
would
be
a
strong
in
the
sense
that
the
contract
was
to
be
performed
there
in
many
instances.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
that
is
correct.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
well,
only
that
the
contract
that
we
have
in
the
instant
case
was
to
be
performed
partly
in
california
because
he
was
to
pay
support
there
when
children
were
in
her
custody.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
that
is
correct.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
no,
the
constitutional
issue
would
not
be
different.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
i
think
that
would
depend
as
to
whether
it
was
understood
in
that
custody
litigation
that
the
mother
lived
in
california.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
i
think
there
is
some
distinction,
justice
white.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
i
think
that
would
be
different,
justice
brennan.
i
think
of
an
agreement
entered
into
--
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
it
is
a
contract.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
i
think
that
it
begins
at
that
point,
justice
white,
to
get
weaker
because
there
are
not
the
contacts
with
oregon
that
we
have
with
california.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
that
is
right,
so
oregon
would
be
distinct.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
i
do
not
believe
that
jurisdiction
would
be
the
same,
but
this
was
not
a
unilateral
act.
sending
a
child
of
11.5
to
california
with
a
one-way
ticket
plus
all
of
her
clothing
is
not
a
unilateral
act
on
behalf
of
the
trial.
it
is
a
deliberate
act
in
which
the
father
participated
and
helped.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
and
that
he
will
pay
support?
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
to
them
in
california?
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
i
think
it
would
be
stronger.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
for
jurisdiction.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
but
i
think
we
have
the
intervening
force
here
of
active
acts
on
the
part
of
the
father
which
resulted
in
these
children
being
residents
of
the
state
and
needing
to
be
supported
in
california.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
had
not
paid
her
airfare,
had
not
sent
her
with
her
clothing?
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
yes.
the
other
acts
would
be,
with
respect
to
the
boy,
the
father
called
the
social
service
agency
in
san
francisco
and
that
is
in
the
record
and
requested
that
the
social
service
agency
investigate.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
no,
he
had
left,
but
he
had
told
the
father
that
he
was
going.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
that
is
correct
under
the
opinion.
however,
i
was
pointing
out
some
acts
that
he
did
take
with
regard
to
the
boy.
he
had
the
social
service
agency
investigate
the
home
and
make
a
report
to
him.
he
then
wrote
a
letter
to
the
mother
which
is
part
of
the
record,
saying
“we
must
renegotiate
our
bargain
because
it
is
no
longer
applicable
to
the
circumstances
as
they
have
developed.”
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
yes.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
certainly
not
standing
alone,
but
i
believe
it
was
a
recognition
by
him
that
he
had
by
his
activity
done
acts
in
california
and
that
he
realized
he
had
to
change
their
agreement.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
thank
you.
i
would
like
to
raise
next
the
case
of
mcgee
v.
international
life
and
point
out
that
in
that
case,
the
court
found
that
one
contact
with
the
state
of
california
was
sufficient
in
the
case
of
an
insured
under
a
life
insurance
contract.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
yes,
i
was
going
to
address
the
mootness.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
with
regard
to
the
issue
of
mootness,
the
california
supreme
court
opinion
was
filed
on
may
26,
1977
and
became
final
on
june
25.
appellant
did
not
move
for
stay
of
the
filing
of
the
supreme
court
of
california
opinion
and
thus
allowed
the
superior
court
for
the
city
and
county
of
san
francisco
to
reacquire
jurisdiction.
we
followed
with
a
motion
for
various
matters
including
support
and
for
determination
of
the
very
substantial
rearage
that
dr.
kulko
was
in,
in
terms
of
support
payments
even
under
the
agreement.
appellant
here
filed
a
written
response
labeled
a
special
appearance
and
i
believe
all
of
the
documents
relevant
to
this
have
been
lodged
with
the
court.
in
this
response,
he
requested
pending
appeal
that
mrs.
horn’s
motion
be
“denied
without
prejudice,
continued
or
stayed.”
appellant’s
attorney
also
spoke
to
the
judge
by
telephone
and
wrote
a
letter
to
the
judge
on
september
8,
1977
which
letter
is
shown
in
our
brief
at
page
10.
we
contend
that
appellant’s
activities
before
the
superior
court
for
the
city
and
county
of
san
francisco
and
state
of
california
constituted
more
than
a
special
appearance
and
constituted
a
general
appearance
waiving
his
rights
to
pursue
jurisdiction
further.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
well,
here
they
are
raising
jurisdictional
issue
and
making
a
special
appearance
only.
there
was
a
request
for
a
continuance
which
has
been
held
many
times
to
constitute
a
general
appearance.
i
do
not
know
that
payment
of
a
judgment
constitutes
a
general
appearance
in
the
same
sense
as
a
request
for
continuance.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
this
happened
after
the
state
court
opinion
became
final,
justice
white.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
i
do
not
have
a
copy
of
the
motion
to
refer
to.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
i
do
not
believe
it
was
urged,
justice
marshall.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
as
to
whether
or
not
the
issue
is
moot?
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
i
am
not
sure
i
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
justice
marshall.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
it
would
be
our
opinion.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
i
would
think
so,
mr.
chief
justice.
under
california
law,
it
is
clearly
,oot
under
the
cases
which
say
that
a
request
for
continuance
is
a
general
appearance.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
i
think
that
he
had
the
right
to
protect,
as
you
honor
suggests.
he
could
have
done
that
however
by
moving
to
stay
the
filing
of
the
supreme
court
of
california
opinion
so
that
it
did
not
become
final,
thereby
putting
jurisdiction
back
in
the
superior
court.
he
did
not
do
that.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
i
am
asking
that
you
recognize
that
in
asking
for
a
form
of
affirmative
relief
from
the
california
superior
court
that
appellant
made
the
general
appearance
causing
the
matter
to
become
moot
at
this
level.
i
would
like
to
make
a
few
more
points
on
the
merits.
in
that
connection,
i
would
like
to
return
to
the
mcgee
case
where
the
court
found
that
one
contact
with
a
california
insured
was
sufficient
because
california
had
shown
a
manifest
interest
in
providing
effective
means
of
redress
for
its
residents
when
their
insurers
refuse
to
pay
claims.
the
case
also
mentioned
that
there
would
be
some
inconvenience
to
the
texas
insurer
from
having
to
defend
in
california,
but
that
this
does
not
constitute
a
denial
of
due
process.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
state
has
a
manifest
interest
in
protecting
the
welfare
of
the
children
who
reside
there.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
prior
to
the
rendering
of
the
california
supreme
court
opinion.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
that
is
correct.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
that
is
correct.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
excuse
me?
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
yes,
but
i
believe
that
the
documents
with
regard
to
the
proceedings
in
the
san
francisco
superior
court
subsequent
to
the
rendering
of
the
supreme
court
opinion
of
the
state
of
california
have
been
lodged
with
the
court
in
our
brief.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
no,
that
happened
after,
justice
marshall.
the
proceedings
in
the
superior
court
of
san
francisco
took
place
in
august
of
1977,
some-four
months
after
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
california
rendered
its
opinion
and
it
had
become
final.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
in
the
san
francisco
superior
court,
he
asked
them
for
a
continuance.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
he
asked
them
not
to
decide
the
merits,
but
he
asked
them
for
a
continuance
or
a
denial
of
the
motion
without
prejudice.
that
is
a
request
for
affirmative
relief.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
i
believe
we
had
cited
in
the
brief
the
applicable
cases
i
am
looking
for
them.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
those
are
different
kinds
of
requests.
it
is
clear
under
california
law
that
a
request
for
a
continuance
is
a
general
appearance.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
yes,
it
is
zobel
v.
zobel
at
page
13,
justice
stevens.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
they
asked
for
a
denial
of
the
motion
without
prejudice.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
the
second
case
down,
knoff
v.
city
and
county
where
there
was
a
written
motion
to
continue
hearing
which
we
have
here.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
a
continuance
in
order
to
file
a
special
appearance
would
not
be
a
general
appearance
under
the
expressed
terms
of
california
code
of
civil
procedure
418.10.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
that
is
at
the
appendix
to
our
brief
where
california
code
of
civil
procedure
418.10
is
set
out
in
its
entirety,
418.10.
but
a
motion
to
continue
a
hearing
is
a
general
appearance
and
what
appellant
made
here
when
he
came
into
the
san
francisco
superior
court
after
the
rendition
of
the
california
supreme
court
opinion
was
a
motion
to
continue
the
hearing
to
deny
it
without
prejudice
or
to
stay
it.
it
was
not
his
request
for
a
continuance
to
file
a
special
appearance
that
i
am
referring
to.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
we
are
suggesting
that
by
that
activity
at
that
time.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
that
is
correct,
but
appellant
requested
a
stay
from
justice
rehnquist
of
this
court
and
he
attached
portions
of
the
record
of
the
san
francisco
superior
court
to
his
request
for
stay
and
it
is,
therefore,
part
of
the
record
and
before
the
court.
i
would
like
to
point
out
one
further
thing
and
that
is
that
appellant
could
have
moved
for
dismissal
of
this
case
on
the
ground
of
inconvenient
forum,
which
code
of
civil
procedure
418.10
clearly
provides
for
without
waiving
any
special
appearance
rights.
he
did
not
choose
to
do
that.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
the
argument
about
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court?
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
i
do
not
think
so.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
if
she
had
moved
to
hawaii
prior
to
the
trial?
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
and
the
agreement?
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
the
agreement
provided
for
performance
partly
in
california
and
not
hawaii?
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
then
i
would
say
that
the
situation
would
be
the
same,
justice
marshall.
ms.
suzie
s.
thorn
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
would.
i
wanted
to
point
out
that
california
has
a
special
interest
in
the
welfare
of
children
residing
there
more
than
it
has
in
insurance
claimants.
they
have
an
interest
in
the
subject
matter
of
the
suit.
