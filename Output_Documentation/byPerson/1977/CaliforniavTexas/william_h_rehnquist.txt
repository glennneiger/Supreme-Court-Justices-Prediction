justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
contend
here
that
there
is
a
federal
constitutional
principle
which
says
that
a
state
may
impose
an
inheritance
tax
or
a
state
tax
only
on
one
particular
set
of
criteria.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
falk,
are
you
familiar
with
lord
canning's
statement,
save,
oh
save
me
from
the
candid
friend.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
general
hill,
if
there
is
a
federal
statute
on
the
books,
i
purport
of
my
brother
marshall's
question,
that
says
federal
court's
must
give
full
faith
and
credit
to
the
decrease
of
state
court's.
do
you
think
that
binds
this
court
as
a
federal
court
in
a
case
under
its
original
jurisdiction.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
have
any
reason
to
take
it
other
than
that
you
think
it
helps
your
case.
