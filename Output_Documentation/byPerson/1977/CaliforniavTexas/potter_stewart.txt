justice
potter
stewart
now
what
sort
of
cause
of
action
would
that
be?
or
let
me
begin
by
asking
you
this,
what
if
texas
asserted
that
the
decedent
had
been
a
domiciliary
of
texas
at
the
time
of
his
death
and
asserted
a
class
a
tax
claim
successfully,
based
upon
that
fact
that
jurisdictional
fact
against
all
his
intangible
properties
that
amounted
to
say
40%,
and
let
us
say
that
california
asserted
an
appropriate
litigation
that
the
decedent
had
been
a
domiciliary
of
california
at
the
time
of
his
death
and
based
upon
that
jurisdictional
finding
asserted
a
tax
claim
that
amounted
another
40%
of
the
decedent
of
state.
what
possible
federal
question
would
be
involved?
justice
potter
stewart
none
and
no
lawsuit
between
those
two
states?
justice
potter
stewart
no
controversy
between
those
two
states?
justice
potter
stewart
certainly
they
can
be.
justice
potter
stewart
and
as
the
point
of
the
dorrance
case
was
just
the
point
implied
in
my
question.
justice
potter
stewart
texas
is
entitled
to
determine
where
--
that
he
is
domicile
in
texas,
california
is
entitled
to
determine
he
was
domicile
in
california;
and
those
two
inconsistent
determinations
create
no
federal
question
at
any
time.
justice
potter
stewart
what
court
â€“
what
law
does
this
court
apply
in
such
cases
then?
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
there
were?
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
texas
had
a
one
set
of
criteria
for
determining
domicile
and
california
had
quite
a
different
set?
justice
potter
stewart
what
difference
--
why
is
that
significant?
justice
potter
stewart
but
what
law
should
the
court
apply?
justice
potter
stewart
why
as
a
matter,
will
we
be
free
to
do
that,
will
we?
justice
potter
stewart
would
it
not
sound
some
sort
of
federal
not
federal,
common
law
because
this
is
a
federal
equity.
justice
potter
stewart
why
do
you
suppose
in
that
mr.
justice
stone's
opinion
for
the
court
in
texas
against
florida,
he
emphasized
the
fact
that
the
laws
of
the
four
states
there
involved
were
basically
identical
with
respect
to
domicile,
why
was
that
of
any
important
at
all--
justice
potter
stewart
because
this
is
my
question
over
a
lawsuit
between
the
sovereign
state
of
texas
and
sovereign
state
of
california?
justice
potter
stewart
whatever
the
lawsuitwas
about,
i
am
talking
about
any
kind
of
a
lawsuitbetween
those
two
parties
and
i
am
talking
about
jurisdiction.
justice
potter
stewart
mr
falk
if
your
complaint
is
filed
and
an
answer
is
filed
and
the
matter
is
referred
to
a
master
what
will
the
issue
be?
issue
over
issues?
justice
potter
stewart
so
they
won't
be
very--?
so
nevada
certainly
is
not
now
and
presumably
will
not
be
a
party?
justice
potter
stewart
unfortunately
it
was
not
to
you
personally.
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
case,
california
seeks
to
invoke
the
original
and
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
this
court
to
settle
a
dispute
with
the
state
of
texas
over
the
question
of
which
state
has
the
power
to
collect
death
taxes
from
the
state
of
the
late
howard
robard
hughes.
the
court
today
without
explanation
of
any
kind
evidently
concludes
that
california's
complaint
does
not
state
acclaim
within
our
original
and
exclusive
jurisdiction.
this
conclusion
seems
to
me
squarely
contrary
to
a
long
standing
precedent
of
this
court.
in
the
case
of
texas
against
florida,
reported
in
volume
306
of
the
united
states
reports.
that
case
was
decided
in
1939,
it
involved
the
estate
of
colonel
edward
green,
the
son
of
the
legendary
hetty
green.
i
have
joined
in
the
order
denying
california's
motion
for
leave
to
file
this
complain,
only
because
i
think
the
case
of
texas
against
florida
was
wrongly
decided
and
should
be
overruled.
my
views
are
set
out
in
the
concurring
opinion
filed
today
which
mr.
justice
powell
and
mr.
justice
stevens
have
joined.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
also
filed
a
concurring
opinion
and
mr.
justice
powell
has
also
filed
a
separate
concurring
opinion.
