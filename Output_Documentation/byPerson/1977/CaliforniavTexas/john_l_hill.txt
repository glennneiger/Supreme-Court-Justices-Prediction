mr.
john
l.
hill
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
let
me
first
quickly
address
the
few
questions
that
were
raised
by
the
court
before
i
get
into
my
prepared
remark.
first,
it
is
not
agreed
that
the
taxes
will
exceed
the
estate
to
combine
taxes.
there
has
been
no
agreement
as
to
the
value
of
the
estate.
there
has
been
one
appraisal
from
maryland
which
is
highly
in
dispute.
we
think
it
ridiculously
low.
california
can
collect
if
it
pierces
the
corporate
veil
and
that
is
been
done
every
time
it
is
been
tried.
were
then
the
twa
litigation,
archaeo
litigation,
or
that
mr.
hughes
that
you
can
not
pierce
the
summa
(inaudible)
and
if
they
do
that
they
can
get
out
a
$
112
million
in
land
wrapped
by
the
airport
and
on
running
along
the
beach
highly
valuable
even
if
they
do
not
establish
domicile.
mr.
john
l.
hill
yes
sir,
the
satis
(ph)
rule
would
allow
them
regardless
of
domicile.
mr.
john
l.
hill
and
there
is
a
controversy,
as
to
whatever
asset
has
been
marshalled.
the
state
compro
is
working
on
that
diligently
now
and
summa's
inability
to
make
money
and
prosper
is
we
think
highly
exaggerated
and
certainly
not
kind
of
speculation,
this
court
can
indulge
in
to
determine
whether
there's
actually
going
to
be
more
taxes
than
the
state
can
stand
and
then
finally
texas
versus
illinois,
does
require
clearly,
that
our
inconsistent
claim
be
such
that
it
would
impair
california's
right
to
collect
on
its
own
client,
and
if
it
has
a
meritorious
claim
and
that
case
obviously
does
not
require
or
contemplate
that
our
inconsistent
claim
be
such
that
it
would
simply
impair
california's
ability
to
get
this
estate
to
settle
with
them,
on
some
basis
that
they
would
consider
favorable.
that
is
not
a
right,
that
this
court's
jurisdiction
is
available
to
protect
and
they
say
texas
was
all,
it
was
in
their
way.
all,
that
was
in
their
way,
to
get
it
settled.
that
is
what
he
forgot
to
add,
and
not
in
their
way
to
try
their
case,
not
in
their
way
to
assert
their
claim
or
the
merits
of
their
claim,
not
in
a
way
to
impair
their
ability
to
collect
on
taxes
but
in
their
way
to
get
a
favorable
settlement
of
a
claim
that
they
are
very
reluctant
to
try
on
its
merits.
that
is
what
texas
is
in
the
way
of.
justice
stevens
question
is
correct
in
suggesting
that
we
should
be
confident
that
the
courts
in
both
states
would
reach
the
same
results
on
the
same
facts
and
certainly
out
of
respect
for
the
state
court's
and
their
proceedings,
we
should
at
least
not
indulge
in
the
opposite
presumption.
in
order
to
try
to
sustain
original
jurisdiction
here.
he
speaks
of
our
own
sense
of
fairness
being
the
only
thing
that
brought
us
here.
then,
why
did
they
wait
nineteen
months
after
we
began
our
litigation
to
suddenly
emerge
in
to
an
atmosphere
of
sweetness
and
light
in
fairness
and
why
did
not
they
try
then
early
to
come
here
and
why
when
they
come,
do
they
not
come
on
the
strength
of
their
own
claim.
if
fairness
is
the
standard,
why
do
they
come
here
tendering
the
limited
issue
and
the
only
issue
to
this
court
and
that
is
texas
domicile.
now,
it
is
texas
position
that
the
agreement
that
was
entered
in
to
on
november
the
10th
1977,
the
day
before
this
motion
for
leave
was
filed
entered
into
between
the
state's
administrator,
certain
here
and
there
and
california.
amounts
relate
to
the
estate
and
the
heirs
agreeing
to
pay
california
in
money
and
services
to
bring
this
case
and
that
therefore
this
court
is
prohibited
both
by
the
letter
and
the
spirit
of
the
united
states
constitution
from
entertaining
any
suit
arising
any
original
jurisdiction
concept
under
these
kind
of
circumstances.
we
say
your
holding
here
must
be,
that
in
no
case,
in
no
case
involving
and
invoking
or
undertaking
to
invoke
the
original
jurisdiction
based
on
article
3
section
2
in
28
usc
section
1251
a1
suits
between
states.
in
no
case,
will
that
jurisdiction
be
extended
or
an
agreement
had
been
executed
prior
there
to
providing
that
the
petitioning
state
is
granted
the
right
to
recover
state
death
taxes
regardless
of
the
merits
of
its
own
case
and
where
the
petitioning
state.
mr.
john
l.
hill
no
question
that
is
what
taxes
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
two
percent
--
even
if
texas
wins.
mr.
john
l.
hill
we
will,
we
are
not
afraid
to
litigate
the
matter
before
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
absolutely,
you
see
they
can
recover
pursuant
to
this
agreement
solely
if
the
court
takes
jurisdiction
and
takes
action
regardless
of
the
quality
of
their
claim.
it
is
a
border
for
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
here
in
tampa.
in
short
we
think
the
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
you
see
annette
loomis
is
a
co-administrator
with
will
loomis
in
the
administration
in
texas.
mr.
john
l.
hill
annette
loomis
is
will
loomis'
mother
and
under
nevada
law
and
california
law,
in
case
of
intestacy,
she
would
be
the
sole
under
texas
law.
if
texas
is
the
domicile
state,
it
opens
up
the
possibility
of
heirship
to
some
four
hundred
people
that
all
have
filed
in
that
court.
in
short,
the
rule
must
be,
we
believe
that
if
a
state
comes
here
under
article
3,
section
2,
it
must
come
clearly
and
unequivocally
under
its
own
statute
or
law
on
which
its
claim
is
based
and
unfettered
by
an
agreement
to
come
here
for
benefit
to
be
bestowed
regardless
of
the
merits
of
the
unclaimed
claim.
mr.
john
l.
hill
they
are
not
a
taxing
state.
mr.
john
l.
hill
well,
i
do
not
think
so.
i
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
attorney
general
of
nevada
would
have
been
entered
in
to
this
agreement.
i
have
no
interest
at
all,
if
shown
no
entries
anymore
than
california
did
until
the
eve
of
our
trial.
that
is
when
they
kept
this
agreement
and
started
showing
an
interest.
they
were
really
interested
why
did
not
they
come
here
why
did
they
permit
us
to
spend
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars,
put
in
thousands
of
man
hours,
out
in
the
wide
open.
most
of
it
and
a
lot
of
it,
carried
out,
in
california.
with
california
counsel
assisting
us,
travel
all
over
the
world
and
take
50
odd
deposition
and
discover
hundreds
of
thousands
of
documents
out
of
three
or
four
million
documents
that
we
were
actually,
both
sides
working
with
pre
trial.
case
set
for
trial,
january
of
1977
it
was
set
for
trial
in
september
of
1977.
all
of
which
they
knew
about
and
let
us
go
ahead
and
proceed
and
go
to
all
that
trouble
and
work
in
our
own
court
and
have
a
fair
and
square
trial
with
overwhelming
evidence
and
i
cannot
obviously
retry
it
here
but
it
is
the
case,
that
will
be
one
wherever
it
is
heard,
and
then
from
here
and
ask
on
behalf
of
the
estate
really,
you
re-litigate
the
taxes
domicile
issue
and
that
is
all
we
are
going
to
tend
to
tell
you
that
very
limited
issue
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
all
they
tenders,
they
would
not
tender
anything
else.
their
motion
tenders
only
to
this
court,
the
question
of
texas
domicile.
you
see
they
just
simply
want
this
court
to
take
it,
give
to
a
master,
hope
that
they
can
gang
up
on
us
and
get
the
mastered
offense.
mr.
john
l.
hill
texas
domicile.
where
the
texas
was
not
the
domicile.
mr.
john
l.
hill
they
win
when
you
cut
us
off.
mr.
john
l.
hill
or
you
cannot
take
it
with
radar
to
try
to
fix
up
taxes
versus
illinois,
in
this
case.
it's
using
this
court
undertaking
to
for
an
inequitable
and
unjust
purpose,
clearly
violates
the
provisions
of
the
eleventh
amendment,
as
a
suit,
which
in
reality
is
for
the
benefit
of
private
litigant.
it
would
also
bring
this
court,
equitable
jurisdiction
in
to
play
without
due
regard
to
first,
the
necessity
of
the
court's
participation.
it
would
invoke
it
without
due
concern
for
the
possible
abuse
of
the
court's
jurisdiction
in
other
cases,
without
first
requiring
california
to
utilize
its
own
court's
to
determine
the
underling
merits
of
its
claim,
without
due
regard
for
the
fact
that
texas
has
already
obtained
a
domicile
verdict
in
its
own
court.
mr.
john
l.
hill
we
would
certainly
claim
that
he
could
not
but
i
will
tell
you
the
jurisdiction
once
taken
here
and
a
masters
report
is
so
often
that
i
have
found
that
in
some
cases,
it
does
seems
to
wipe
up
a
lot
of
things
that
have
happened
before.
one
thing
you
say
we
just
want
a
little
jurisdiction
for
little
purpose
but
once
you
appoint
that
master
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
well,
he
could
conceivably
find
the
texas
was
not
the
domicile
state.
mr.
john
l.
hill
we
would
have
a
you
have
a
honey
(ph)
of
a
situation.
mr.
john
l.
hill
clearly
and
they
are
asking
you
to
come
in
here
without
regard
or
requiring
california
to
really
come
and
present
a
hard
and
concrete
case
to
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
we
will
certainly
take
that
position,
but
i
do
not
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
i
would
settle
for
that
reason
until
another
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
really
not
because
we
just
have
considerations
here
that
have
not
been
fought
out,
they
do
not
even
get
in
to
all
commit
forums
and
this
court
and
i
know
i
need
not
unduly
cite
your
own
opinion
but
this
is
so
relevant
to
what
i
am
trying
to
convey
from
texas's
standpoint
is
your
statement
recently
made
in
arizona
versus
new
mexico
and
may
i
please
quote
it,
“we
recently
reaffirm
that
our
original
jurisdiction
should
be
invoked
sparingly
in
illinois
versus
city
of
milwaukee,
where
we
additionally
stated,
we
construe
28
usc
section
1251
a1
as
we
do
article
3
section
2
to
honor
our
original
jurisdiction
but
to
make
it
obligatory
only
in
appropriate
cases
and
the
question
of
what
is
appropriate
concerns
a
court
the
seriousness
and
dignity
of
the
client.
yet
beyond
that
it
necessarily
involves
the
availability
of
another
forum
where
there
is
jurisdiction
over
the
main
parties,
where
the
issues
tendered
may
be
litigated
and
where
appropriately
relief
may
be
had.
we
incline
to
sparing
use
of
our
original
jurisdiction
so
that
our
increasing
duties
with
the
appellate
docket
will
not
suffer”
nearly
forty
years
ago
in
massachusetts
versus
missouri
to
which
counsel
falk
alluded,
this
court
said,
in
the
exercise
of
our
original
jurisdiction,
so
as
to
truly
fulfill,
the
constitutional
purpose
we
not
only
must
look
to
the
nature
of
the
interest
of
the
complaining
state,
the
essential
quality
of
the
right
asserted,
but
we
must
also
inquire
whether
recourse
to
that
jurisdiction
is
necessary
for
the
state's
protection.
now
then,
with
that
in
mind
the
narrowness
of
the
issue
tendered
by
california,
that
is
a
negative
finding
against
texas,
is
proof
enough
that
the
quality
of
interest
attempted
to
be
provided
to
california
that
is
an
18%
interest
by
settlement
that
she
may
not
be
entitled
to
under
any
merits.
is
not
of
a
kind
to
be
entertained
here
by
this
court
and
invoking
that
solemn
jurisdiction.
if
california
really
wants
to
litigate
its
entitlement
that
issue
of
domicile
can
and
should
be
under
the
circumstances
here
presented,
litigated
in
california.
if
california
is
successful
there
on
that
issue
it
can
repetition
here
if
in
fact,
facts
and
information
show
that
there
is
a
more
tax
that
they
can
not
get
there,
their
taxation
and
then
you
could
decide
whether
take
case
or
let
it
be
heard
in
delaware
forum
where
the
question
of
similar
corporation
exists
and
where
any
problem
that
do
in
fact
ever
occur,
are
not
pursuant
to
some
settlement
agreement
but
pursuant
to
on
its
claim
being
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
when
we
get
to
the
position--
mr.
john
l.
hill
no,
not
now.
we
are
clearly
are
not
and
we
not
anticipate
it,
if
california
does
try
the
case.
mr.
john
l.
hill
solve
the
problem
it
is--
that
is
true.
mr.
john
l.
hill
it
could
only
come
up
and
i
do
not
want
to
be
bound
by
this
because,
i
do
not
think
it
is
necessary
for
us
to
get
into
it
in
this
proceeding.
but
as
i
see
it
the
only
way
that
it
could
possibly
and
underscore
possibly
come
up
would
be
if
california
in
fact
secured
a
favorable
finding
in
its
court,
on
the
merits
and
then
the
proof
showed
that
it
was
impossible
for
us
to
get
the
matter
disposed
off
or
that
harm
of
120%
and
these
sort
of
figures
that
i
think
are
ridiculous
and
never
will
come
to
pay.
so
at
most
i
think
you
are
looking
at
a
101.
if
that,
with
a
growing
concern
able
to
pay
it
out
over
ten
years
but
in
any
event
if
all
of
those
speculated
problems
finally
came
to
rest
then
you
would
have
the
one
piece
of
intangible
property
to
which
all
would
be
looking
and
that
is
the
summa
stock
which
you
just
–
as
you
know
only
there
is
only
one
stockholder
with
75,000
shares
of
stock
but
only
one
stockholder
is
presently
being
held
and
voted
by
mr.
will
loomis
under
there
argument.
i
think
they
would
have
the
that
would
then
be
a
forum
where
you
could
determine
all
rights
between
us,
how
do
we
tax
the
intangible?
mr.
john
l.
hill
i
think.
mr.
john
l.
hill
if
we
are
asserting
if
we
come
in
there
and
assert
that
we
want
to
get
out
the
intangible
stock
asset
which
is
cited
in
delaware
that
being
the
corporate
basis
there.
mr.
john
l.
hill
i
think
what
i
am
saying
is
mr.
justice
stewart
if
that
would
be
an
election,
i
think
for
these
states
to
make.
mr.
john
l.
hill
i
think
so.
mr.
john
l.
hill
no.
i
suppose
you
--
it
would
be
a
matter
of
two
states--
two
or
more
states
filing
competing
claims
to
the
same
properties.
mr.
john
l.
hill
and
then
let
me
just
close
by--
mr.
john
l.
hill
i
think
all
these
question
about
delaware
if
i
might
say
so
that
i
do
not
go
further
here
then
it
is
obviously
necessary,
to
cite
what
we
are
here
about,
is
simply
to
say
that
that
question
can
be
addressed
if
it
ever
becomes
proper
to
be
addressed
and
this
court
will
have
an
opportunity
to
look
at
that
if
it
ever
become
your
--.
mr.
john
l.
hill
i
do
not
know.
it
would
just
depend
on
--
if
they
have
a
case
at
that
time
stated
without
reference
to
agreement
under
texas
v.
illinois
and
i
thought
texas
v.
illinois
applied,
i
then
have
to
make
a
determination,
it
would
ask
you
to
the
deal
--
we
do
not
have
to
deal
with
it
here,
i
might
want
you
to
ask
you
to
deal
with
it
if
it
ever
came
to
that
i
make
it--
and
this
court
might
want
to
reconsider
it.
mr.
john
l.
hill
well
i
am
not,
general
mcgraw,
45
years
ago
came
into
this
court
with
a
lot
of
other
attorney
generals,
pretty
much
by
agreement.
and
once
the
court
would
not
let
him
in
until
i
could
go
out
and
resolve
the
fact
of
what
the
tactic
were
going
to
be
so
that
the
master
would
not
have
all
that
foolish
work
to
do
and
then
when
they
came
back
in
practically
in
agreed
situation,
the
court
took
it.
justice
frankfurter
did
not
think
much
of
it,
but
that
neither
here
and
there,
they
did
take
it
and
they
heard
it
and
they
resolved
it
and
texas
who
brought
it,
lost
and
i
think
that
general
mccraw
were
he
here
today
would
be
applauding
what
i
am
doing
and
believe
that
it
is
totally
consistent
with
what
i
should
be
doing
and
it
is
an
entirely
different
situation,
this
is
not
in
any
sense
a
texas
v.
florida
case.
mr.
john
l.
hill
exactly.
mr.
john
l.
hill
those
are--
mr.
john
l.
hill
and
so
i
just
conclude
by
reminding
that
if
there
is
a
slightest
doubt
about
why
we
are
here
and
that
i
say
we
are
here
out
of
the
state's
worry
over
the
texas
domicile
finding
not
only
for
state
tax
purposes
but
for
other
purposes
that
it
ought
to
be
perfectly
clear
when
you
look
at
this
agreement
that
is
why
we
are
here
because
in
addition
to
giving
them
the
2%
guarantee
they
come
back
and
say
we
will
give
you
all
of
the
lawyers
you
need,
some
of
them
here
today
in
court
we
will
work
with
you
hand
and
glove
and
we
will
give
you
all
of
our
deposition,
we
will
give
you
all
of
our
work
product
and
maybe
together
we
can
do
texas--
mr.
john
l.
hill
i
think
for
today
at
least,
for
the
purpose
of
this
hearing,
the
answer
would
be
that
if
it
is
a
101
and
we
do
not
know
but
let
us
assume
for
purpose
of
your
question
it
is.
then
california
is
petitioning
here
to
get
you
to
vitalize
an
agreement
which
would
cut
there,
would
harm
them
68
%
of
what
they
say,
they
are
entitled
to
under
their
figures
and
yet
they
want
you
to
do
it
under
the
authority
of
the
case
that
would
say
we
are
going
to
protect
you
from
1%
of
harm.
so
under
this
agreement,
it
is
just
simply
immaterial
inquiry,
now
as
to
whether
it
is
a
101%
ends
up
being
98%.
it
is
not
the
inquiry,
the
basic
inquiry
before
this
court
because
the
fundamental
lies
in
their
case
is
this
agreement.
you
can
not
get
away
from
it,
will
loomis
and
it
is
in
our
brief
used
the
words,
i
have
them
written
down
somewhere
where
he
said
in
affect
that
we
are
here
pursuant
to
this
agreement,
that
is
his
sworn
testimony
given
in
december.
now
there
cannot
be
any
doubt
about
that
we
are
here
pursuant
to
that
agreement
and
that
is
the
full
answer,
a
complete
answer,
a
total
answer
to
the
denial
of
this
motion
for
leave
to
file
and
invoke
this
court's
to
original
jurisdiction.
never
should
this
court
tolerate
that
kind
of
a
situation
and
you
would
rule
to
death
(ph)
if
you
did
and
open
the
gates
for
this
kind
of
trading
around
between
higher
state
tax
cases,
the
states
with
weak
claims,
to
try
to
get
negative
finding
against
16%
states
with
good
claims.
mr.
john
l.
hill
we
are
trying
the
jury
verdict
and
we
will
have
an
a
judgment
entered
on
april
4th.
mr.
john
l.
hill
the
motion
for
judgment
which
we
have
filed,
i
am
frank,
i
will
have
to
ask
my
associates
whether
they
have
filed.
i
have
not
seen
the
pleading
recently,
i
would
not
want
to
miss
state
if
they
have
filed
a
motion
to
set
it
aside,
i
would
be
most
surprised.
they
argued
the
case
about
thirty
minutes
although
they
had
several
hours
to
argue
because
when
all
the
evidence
was
there,
they
did
not
have
much
to
talk
about
and
they
have
plenty
of
evidence
to
support
the
verdict.
the
case
is
cleanly
tried.
it
is
going
to
stand
us
without
any
question.
mr.
john
l.
hill
absolutely,
through
our
appellate
process
which
is,
i
am
sure
under
circumstances
like
we
are
faced
with
that
is
something
we
can
contemplate.
thank
you
very
much.
