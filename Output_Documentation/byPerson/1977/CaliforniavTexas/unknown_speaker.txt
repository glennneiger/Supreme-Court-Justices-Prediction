unknown
speaker
do
we
know
as
a
fact
that
the
tax
claims
do
exceed
the
assets
in
the
state?
unknown
speaker
but
we
know
what
the
size
of
the
state,
does
anyone
know
about
it
exactly?
unknown
speaker
this
is
the
federal
state
tax
returns
--
unknown
speaker
i
assume
the
corporation
does.
unknown
speaker
are
those
assets
sufficient
to
pay
the
california
death
taxes
if
it
is
determined
that
mr.
hughes
was
not
a
california
domiciliary?
unknown
speaker
well
that
is
in
litigation
is
it
not
in
delaware?
unknown
speaker
could
it
be?
unknown
speaker
has
texas
intervened
in
the
delaware
litigation?
unknown
speaker
california
has
made
no
appearance?
unknown
speaker
mr.
falk,
do
you
not
suppose
that
may
be
some
controversy
over
the
values
submitted
in
the
federal
state
tax
returns.
unknown
speaker
for
example,
summa
corporation.
unknown
speaker
well
i
just
wonder
on
the
issue
before
us,
how
that
bears
on
whether
or
not
we
ought
to
accept
there
is
no
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
controversy
although
whether
all
of
the
assets
of
mr.
hughes
have
been
marshaled?
unknown
speaker
there
really
was
never
a
basis
for
classic
interpleader,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well
now
that
in
--
you
say
texas
is
asserting
an
inconsistent
claim
and
then
you
say
that
the
cause
of
the
assertion
of
that
claim
are
california
is
unable
to
settle
with
the
estate,
those
are
two
separate
assertions
you
make
and
both
of
them
would
have
to
be
upheld
in
order
to
support
your
alternative
theory
--
unknown
speaker
well
survive
the
pleading
state?
unknown
speaker
on
following
through
on
justice
stewart's
question,
it
has
always
been
assumed
that
inheritance
of
taxes
follow
domicile,
do
you
think
in
our
jurisprudence
we
have
gone
beyond
that
point
or
about
to
or
not
may
be
individual
states
can
rest
on
something
other
than
common
law
notions
of
domicile?
unknown
speaker
mr.
falk,
are
not
there
cases
and
decisions
in
these
original
jurisdiction
cases,
where
this
court
has
fashioned
a
rule
of
law
unknown
speaker
well
what
--
when
we
do
that,
what
are
we
doing?
unknown
speaker
what
is
unique
about
our
doing
that
in
this
situation?
unknown
speaker
we
don't
think
it
might
also
but
read
as
making
it
easy
to
fashion
that
rule
--
the
federal
rule
--
resolution
is
dispute
among
--
unknown
speaker
but
may
be
mr.
justice
stone's
emphasis
on
the
fact
that
the
all
four
were
the
same.
just
made
it
easier
--
that
is
federal
rule.
unknown
speaker
and
dividing
inter
state
--?
unknown
speaker
mr.
falk,
may
i
just
question
the
proposition.
i
am
intrigued
by
my
brother
stewart's
question.
you
say
the
law
of
the
two
states
is
identical,
now
may
be
the
black
letter
law
is
the
same
but
we
all
know
that
there
are
all
sorts
of
gradations
when
you
apply
a
rule,
may
be
in
texas
they
attach
greater
weight
to
the
place
of
birth
in
determining
what
element
conclusion
is
and
in
the
california
that
may
attach
greater
weight
to
some
other
fact,
their
shadings
which
may
produce
inconsistent
results
which
one
could
describe
as
differences
in
the
laws
of
the
two
jurisdictions.
unknown
speaker
the
law
of
the
two
states
is
really
completely
identical,
cannot
we
be
confident
that
the
two
states
will
reach
the
same
result
and
the
same
set
of
facts?
unknown
speaker
california
asserts
as
a
litigant.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
texas,
impact
of
any
of
the
agreement
you
have
made,
the
states
may
have
made?
unknown
speaker
that
is
california.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
may
i
understand
this
mr.
attorney
general,
is
this
an
argument
that
in
fact
california's
funding
for
the
heirs
--
unknown
speaker
is
that
is
what
it
is.
well
i
thought
this
agreement
guarantees
california
the
sum
of
2
million
dollars,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
it
is
two
percent
--
unknown
speaker
so
i
gather
your
argument
is
we
ought
not
take
this
case
in
original
jurisdiction
because
if
california
is
merely
funding
for
heirs,
that
creates
a
kind
of
eleventh
amendment
problem
that
mr.
falk
referred
to.
unknown
speaker
and
is
it
that
the
heirs
come
out
better
at
least
inheritance
tax
wise
under
this
california
agreement
and
perhaps
they
are
going
to
come
out
if
taxes
can
claim.
unknown
speaker
i
am
sorry
i
do
not
know
this.
unknown
speaker
mr.
attorney
general,
if
the
agreement
had
not
been
made
do
you
think
the
state
of
nevada
would
be
in
here?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
would
they
be
in
here?
unknown
speaker
is
that
as
you
see
is
what
the
issue
would
be
if
this
complaint
is
filed.
whether
or
not
the
decedent
lived
in
texas.
is
that
going
to
be
the
question
or
else
the
question
is
going
to
be
where
did
he
live?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
will
be
the
issue
be
before
the
--
unknown
speaker
whether
or
not,
texas
was
the
domicile
of
decedent
at
the
time
of
his
death
or
where
was
the
domicile
of
the
decedent
at
that
time?
unknown
speaker
quite
different
therefore
from
texas
and
florida.
unknown
speaker
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
perhaps
or
in
any
event
if
it
is
a
matter
not
at
all
of
law,
it
is
a
matter
of
state
laws,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
mr.
attorney
general
you
want
â€“
are
you
willing
to
litigate
in
delaware?
unknown
speaker
the
answer
is
no
right
now.
unknown
speaker
of
course
it
might
be
a
forum
if
both
of
you
agreed
to
solve
the
entire
problem?
unknown
speaker
would
the
delaware
forum
as
you
call
it
have
jurisdiction
over
a
lawsuitbetween
the
state
of
texas
and
the
state
of
california?
unknown
speaker
and
that
forum
would
have
jurisdiction,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
will
have
to
be
volunteered?
unknown
speaker
neither
can
compel
the
other
to
appear
in
delaware
court,
could
it?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
to
a
delaware
asset
that
is
clearly
within
the
jurisdiction
of
delaware
court?
unknown
speaker
general
hill,
a
little
while
ago
you
said
that
california
should
go
about
its
business
and
proceed
in
its
own
courts
and
so
forth
and
then
come
here
when
certain
things
were
established,
would
you
be
opposing
original
jurisdiction
at
that
time
also?
unknown
speaker
general
hill
at
least
the
agreement
accomplished
the
elimination
of
nevada
as
a
possible
party,
this
is
one
thing
it
had
accomplished.
after
all
you
are
in
a
position
here
representing
a
state
which
itself
brought
the
texas
against
florida
litigation.
now
you
are
representing
the
state
which
denies
the
original
jurisdiction
of
this
court,
you
are
hung
with
it,
but
there
it
is.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it,
at
a
later
time
your
first
claim
would
be
that
the
matter
of
domicile
would
not
be
open
for
any
kind
of
reconsideration
because
it
is
clearly
determined
in
the
texas
court
and
that
would
be
true
later
if
you
all
thought
that
you
should
go
to
delaware
to
try
to
--
unknown
speaker
then
you
would
say
that,
the
everything
might
be
opening
but
not
that
domicile.
unknown
speaker
that
can
be
reviewable
by
this
court
or
any
other
federal
court
it
is
not
a
question
of
federal
law
is
it?
unknown
speaker
general
hill,
what
is
the
present
status
of
the
texas
litigation?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
that
motion
is
to
set
the
verdict
aside
then,
are
they?
unknown
speaker
but
there
--
whatever
the
accuracy
of
your
prediction
there
is,
there
will
be
an
opportunity
of
an
appeal
in
the
national
state
court
system?
unknown
speaker
and
yet
as
i
understand
the
facts
from
reading
these
papers
and
from
reading
newspapers
that
the
decedent
spent
in,
as
far
as
he
lived
in
the
united
states
from
where
he
resided
was
physically
in
the
united
states
of
america
and
his
last
years
of
his
life,
most
of
those
years
were
in
nevada,
were
they
not?
unknown
speaker
no
i
am
talking
about
final
years
of
his
life.
unknown
speaker
the
final
years
of
his
life
were
in
as
far
as
he
was
in
the
united
states,
he
was
in
nevada
most
of
the
time.
unknown
speaker
if
there
is
a,
generally
in
an
adversarial
system
of
justice,
you
have
parties
litigating
and
theory
is
from
that
litigation
emerges
the
truth
but
if
nevada
is
not
even
going
to
be
in
this
lawsuit,
how
can
a
very
accurate
assessment
of
the
facts
be
made?
unknown
speaker
generally
a
lawsuit
is
not
destined
to
determine
a
negative,
that
somebody
did
not
live
in
a
certain
state.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
not
think
that
to
answer
the
question
you
have
put
in
your
prayer,
are
you
not
going
to
have
to
decide
whether,
where
he
was
domiciled?
unknown
speaker
is
it
possible,
how
can
you
say
--
are
not
you
have
to
conclude
that
he
was
domiciled
somewhere
else
and
therefore
he
was
not
domiciled
in
texas--
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
it
is
sufficient
to
show
that
he
was
domiciled
in
california
uptil
1966
and
then
left
california
and
never
returned
and
spent
the
rest
of
his
life
in
nevada?
unknown
speaker
if
a
master
were
appointed
to
determine
this
and
he
were
to
determine
that
domicile
was
nevada
at
the
time
of
mr.
hughes
death.
do
i
understand
there
is
no
inheritance
this
tax
in
nevada?
unknown
speaker
what
then
would
be
the
effect
of
that
determination
that
he
was
domiciled
in
nevada
upon
the
state's
claims
to
inherit
this
taxes.
unknown
speaker
but
under
the
agreement
california
would
still
have
at
least
2
million,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
so
california
would
not
lose
if
the
master
were
to
conclude
that
nevada
was
the
domicile
--
unknown
speaker
no,
but
am
i
right?
unknown
speaker
california
would
not
but
texas
would.
unknown
speaker
the
only
one
who
would
lose
would
be
the
united
states
because
then
the
credit
against
the
federal
state
tax
would
apply.
unknown
speaker
without
the
agreement
there
would
be
no
credit
for
state
taxes
pays.
unknown
speaker
is
it
true
with
respect
to
nevada
domiciliaries
?
unknown
speaker
well
if
nevada
was
determined
to
be
the
domicile
and
the
state
nevertheless
paid
you
$16
million
or
what
is
it
18%.
unknown
speaker
18%,
which
is
how
many
million
dollar?
unknown
speaker
would
the
payment
from
the
state
of
that
18%
be
in
a
state
taxes
paid
deduction?
unknown
speaker
oh
yes
but
then
one
party
that
controversy
files
a
lawsuit
as
a
part
of
which
it
is
essential
to
determine
domicile
and
it
is
determined
contrary
the
claims
and
the
party
filling
the
suit.
unknown
speaker
now
what
do
you
state
mr.
falk
in
the
same
position
of
the
executives
of
the
dorrance
state
where
they
volunteered
the
payment
to
pennsylvania
and
then
new
jersey
interposed
the
claim
and
established
domicile
and
collected
$18
million
against
pennsylvania's
$16
million
and
then
the
when
the
executives
tried
to
get
back
to
$16
million
from
pennsylvania
they
were
told
no
that
was
a
voluntary
thing.
unknown
speaker
well
of
course
you
will
call
dorrance
executive
were
surcharged
for
that.
unknown
speaker
and
i
just
wonder
here
if
it
would
determine
that
nevada
after
all
where
there
is
no
inheritance
tax
was
the
domicile.
what
about
the
state
paying
california?
unknown
speaker
this
plus
inheritance
taxes.
i
think
that
would
be
entirely
baseless
assuming
that
you
can
pierce
these
summa
corporation
veil
because
you
have
some
substantial
taxes
--.
unknown
speaker
mr.
falk,
are
you
a
full
time
attorney
general
for
the
state
of
california?
unknown
speaker
well,
except
this
complaint
does
not
to
ask
the
court
to
determine
that
the
decedent
--
where
the
decedent
was
domiciled
whether
nevada
or
the
bahamas
or
mexico
or
where,
simply
that
he
was
on
the
date
of
his
death
not
a
domiciliary
of
texas.
unknown
speaker
it
may
well
be
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
but
we
have
to
reach
our
decision
on
the
basis
of
the
pleadings
as
they
are
now
before
us.
