we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
state
of
california
against
the
state
of
texas
and
original
jurisdiction
case.
mr.
falk,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
for
purposes
of
our
evaluating
whether
this
is
or
is
not
an
appropriate
case
for
original
jurisdiction,
in
your
view,
would
it
make
any
difference
whether
the
total
of
all
the
taxes
would
consume
95%
of
the
entire
assets
or
whether
they
would
be
a
105%?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
falk.
mr.
attorney
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
attorney
general,
a
while
ago
you
said
that
the
figure
of
120%,
that
is
referring
to
the
aggregate
amount
of
taxes
was
absurd,
ridiculous
something
like
that
and
that
in
any
event
it
was
not
more
that
a
101%.
now
for
the
purposes
of
this,
case
what
is
the
difference
whether
it
a
100--
the
taxes
are
101%
of
all
the
assets
or
98%
of
all
the
assets.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr
falk,
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
theory
mr.
falk
is
that
a
neutral
forum
was
the
only
place
for
a
controversy
of
this
kind
to
be
settled
why
should
not
your
prayer
have
been
to
determine
what
you
say
now
is
the
defactoral
issue.
where
was
the
domicile
of
mr.
hughes
at
the
time
of
his
death
instead
of
just
attacking
it
on
in
terms
of
texas?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
have
you
ever
represented
any
other
party
to
this
case
other
than
the
state
of
california?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
on
the
basis
of
some
possible
amendment
that
you
may
have
in
mind.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
thank
you
gentleme.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
original,
number
76
filed
under
the
original
jurisdiction
provisions
of
the
constitution
by
california
against
texas,
the
motion
for
leave
and
to
file
a
bill
of
complain
is
denied.
chief
justice
warren

you
mr.
