mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
begin
by
identifying
four
of
the
factors
which
prompted
california
to
invoke
this
court's
jurisdiction.
for
these
same
considerations
in
our
judgment
make
the
exercise
of
that
jurisdiction
appropriate
and
indeed
imperative.
the
first
jurisdiction,
first
consideration
was
the
technical
basis
for
jurisdiction
under
texas
versus
florida,
point
of
which
of
course
i
will
be
elaborating
upon
throughout
this
argument
and
namely
that
the
tax
claims
which
have
been
asserted
by
various
taxing
entities
exceed
the
available
assets
of
the
state.
for
the
moment,
suffice
it
to
say
that
once
we
determined
that
this
was
a
situation
in
which
the
tax
claims
did
have
that
quality,
we
had
a
very
practical
and
real
concern
that
if
california
were
successful
in
its
own
courts,
the
judgment
it
came
might
not
be
as
collectible.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
yes
we
assert
that
at
our
pleading
and
i
think
have
demonstrated
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
think
it
is
not
agreed
to
mr.
justice
brennan
by
texas
and
i
am
prepared
to
discuss
the
reasons
why
we
think
that
that
it
is
demonstrably
so
that
they
do
it
just
as
an
arithmetical
matter,
the
tax
rates
total
a
101%
on
all
of
the
major
portion
of
the
state--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
well
that
state
has
filed
a
return
and
based
--
we
have
attached
to
our
pleading
an
appendix,
appendix
a
which
sets
forth
the
calculations
of
the
taxes
under
the
various
federal
and
state
rates
based
on
the
return
filed
by
the
state
on
their
own
agreed
value,
the
problem
becomes
exacerbated
if
the
rates,
if
the
amount
of
the
state
is
greater
but
even
on
those
rates
there
is
a
short
fall
of
many
millions
of
dollars.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
the
federal
state
tax
returns
and
also
the
california
it
22.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
no
the
state
does
not
mr.
justice
blackmun
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
assume
it
does
but
unless
it
is
an
alter
ego
we
cannot
reach
it.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
no
because
we
can't
reach
the
assets
of
summa
unless
it
is
proven
to
be
an
alter
ego
of
mr.
hughes.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
do
not
believe
it
is
a
litigation
in
delaware
and
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
do
not
believe
it
could
be
in
delaware,
i
suppose
we
certainly
could
contend
and
i
think
would
if
compelled
to
but
it
is
far
from
clear
that
such
a
contention
would
be
accepted.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
texas
has
been
named
as
a
party
in
the
delaware
litigation
and
contends
and
i
must
say,
i
think
rightly,
that
it
cannot
be
made
a
party
there
provisions
of
sovereign
immunity
and
i
think
for
reasons
of
due
process
it
is
not
voluntarily
appeared
as
i
understand
that
they
made
a
motion
that
quash,
if
that
motion
is
pending
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
california
has
made
no
appearance
and
intends
to
make
no
appearance.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
fully
expect
that
there
will,
i
believe
that
all
of
the
taxing
authorities
will
contend
that
the
values
are
greater.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
summa
corporation
being
the
main
asset
and
there
is
an
internal
revenue
service
investigation
and
the
states
were
doing
likewise.
i
think
it
is
quite
unlikely
that
the
values
will
be
less,
the
values
that
were
reported
to
put
it
mildly
work
were
conservative
we
think
and
we
think
that
the
values
will
be
larger
but
it
would
take
a
dramatic
cut
which
is
i
think
unconceivable
for
the
problem
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
think
it
that
there
is
really
no
realistic
possibility
and
texas
does
not
contend
that
the
values
are
less
and
there
is
really
no
realistic
possibility
that
the
values
would
be
such
that
lower
rates
of
tax
would
apply,
so
we
are
in
a
situation
in
which
i
think
it
is
safe
to
say
that
the
tax
rates
combine
to
a
101%
and
that
problem
is
exacerbated
by
a
couple
of
factors
that
are
mentioned
in
our
brief.
one,
that
some
of
the
items
which
are
expenditures
by
the
estate,
for
example,
for
litigation
expenses
which
are
lawful
figure
are
not
deductible
under
california
law.
as
a
result
although
they
are
losing
the
money
in
the
form
of
these
expenses,
it
does
not
reduce
their
california
taxes
and
that
again
only
exacerbates
the
short
fall.
the
second
problem
is
that
has
summa
has
encountered
really
staggering
law
suits
in
the
year
since
mr.
hughes
died.
it
was
$29million
of
operating
losses
in
1976,
and
i
think
the
figure
was
a
169
million
if
i
recall
correctly
of
reduction
of
net
book
values
in
that
same
year.
1977
is
not
formalized,
we
have
been
advised
informally
that
the
figure
would
be
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
$15million.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
am
not
aware
of
any,
i
think
they
have
pretty
much
been
identified
in
our
subject
of
administrations
in
several
states
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
well
the
state
tax
return
was
based
on
appraisal
of
the
value
not
on
book
value,
and
that
will
be
the
basis
on
which
tax
will
be
concerned,
there
was
a
pending
controversy
as
to
whether
that
appraisal
is
an
appropriate
one.
that--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
well,
mr.
chief
justice
in
my
view
it
would
not,
but
i
think
under
texas
v.
florida
the
100%
mark
has
special
significance.
i
do
not
think
i
have
to
persuade
you
of
my
alternative
view
but
i
might
in
response
to
your
question
suggest
you
briefly
what
it
is.
it
starts
with
massachusetts
v.
missouri,
308
u.s.
where
the
court
refused
to
entertain
a
suit
to
prevent
missouri
from
imposing
a
tax
on
a
trust
that
had
been
established
by
massachusetts
domiciliary
with
missouri
trusties.
the
court
distinguished
texas
v.
florida
in
that
case,
but
on
grounds
which
to
me
suggest
that
the
100%
figure
is
not
the
end
of
the
case.
after
noting
that
the
trust
assets
of
the
missouri
trust
were
sufficient
to
pay
the
taxes
of
both
states,
the
court
went
on
to
say
and
i
am
going
to
quote
from
it,
“it
was
not
shown
that
the
tax
claims
of
the
two
states
are
mutually
exclusive”
and
that
to
the
contrary
again
quoting,
“the
validity
of
each
claim
is
wholly
independent
of
that
of
the
other”
under
which,
there
was
not
a
central
issue
domicile.
from
this,
we
think
that
there
is
jurisdiction
of
a
suit
between
states
in
this
area,
where
two
things
are
shown.
first,
that
two
or
more
states
each
seek
to
levy
a
tax
on
a
mutually
exclusive
ground
as
there
was
in
texas
v.
florida
and
as
there
is
here,
domicile;
and
secondly
that
the
claim
of
the
defendant
state
in
some
concrete
way,
in
some
real
way,
injures
the
plaintiff
state.
now
in
texas
v.
florida
that
second
element
of
concrete
injury
was
shown
by
the
fact
that
the
tax
claims
exceeded
a
100%
and
so
you
had
a
classic
in
the
nature
of
interpleader
situation.
even
if
that
were
not
here,
we
believe
that
our
pleading
show
another
kind
of
concrete
injury
that
satisfies
the
standing
in
case
of
controversy
requirements
and
that
is
this.
we
found
ourselves
with
an
inheritance
tax
claim
which
it,
which
we
and
the
estate
mutually
desire
to
compromise
and
thereby
avoid
years
of
costly
litigation.
dependency
of
the
texas'
claim
was
all
that
stood
in
the
way
of
california
and
the
estate,
totally
resolving
the
inheritance
tax
matter.
it
was
dependency
of
that
claim
which
prevented
the
estate
from
unconditionally
agreeing
to
settle
this
case
for
a
very
understandable
reason,
if
they
agreed
to
pay
a
large
tax
to
california
and
they
are
liable
to
it,
texas
for
a
16%
tax,
the
result
would
be
devastating
and
if
they
were
unwilling
and
understandably
so
to
agree,
this
is
the
problem
with
any
situation
of
an
interpleader
type,
where
you
cannot
get
all
of
the
parties
under
--
into
one
court.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
no
it
is
not,
i
do
not
contend
that
it
is
an
interpleader,
i
say
that
it
is,
if
you
were
forced
to
conclude,that
they
were
not
a
100%
--
that
the
taxes
did
not
exceed
a
100%,
there
would
still
be
a
controversy
between
california
and
texas,
not
in
the
classic
interpleader
mode
but
simply
because
texas
is
asserting
an
inconsistent
claim
with
california
--
which
is
inconsistent
with
california,
that
would
prevent
california
from
resolving
a
major
controversy
with
the
estate.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
you
mean
factually,
it
is
factually
up
held
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
yes
yes,
now
i
do
want
to
stress
that
this
is
not
our
primary
submission,
it
arises
and
is
necessary
only
if
we
are
mistaken
and
the
tax
claims
do
not
exceed
a
100%.
i
am
absolutely
satisfied
that
they
do
but
in
response
to
the
chief
justice's
question
i
wanted
to
develop
that
point.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
do
not
think
there
is
a
federal
question.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
well,
i
do
disagree
with
this
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
well,
the
controversy
that
i
perceive
in
that
situation
is
not
a
federal
question
but
it
is
a
controversy.
both
states
cannot
be
right
although,
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
no
i
think
both
states
can
successfully
get
judgments
but
as
a
conceptual
matter
one
cannot
have
two
domiciles
that
was
the
point
of
texas
v.
florida,
then
only
one
of
the
four
states
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
think
the
point
of
mr.
justice
stewart
of
the
previous
cases
including
the
dorrance
litigation
is
that
although
one
can
have
but
one
domicile,
that
our
federal
system
permits
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
agree
they
do
not
and
that
of
course
is
why
texas
v.
florida
arises
because
there
is
no
solution
to
the
problem
where
the
taxes
exceed
a
100%
say,
for
an
action
in
this
court.
there
is
no
other
way
to
get
a
unitary
adjudication.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
well
i
think
in
texas
v.
florida
and
i
think
it
would
be
true
here
that
the
court
find,
that
the
court
will
have
no
choice
of
problem
because
there
is
no
difference
in
the
law
that
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
do
not
know
from
any
decision
of
this
court,
i
assume
it
would
have
to
apply
it's
own
principles
of
domicile.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
if
that
were
the
law,
mr.
justice
stewart
one
aspect
of
texas
v.
florida
would
not
be
present
and
that
was
not
emphasized
in
the
court's
opinion
here
that
the
law
was
the
same
in
all
four
states.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
well
it
--
as
i
understand
an
interpleader
--
the
interpleader
concept,
in
the
nature
of
interpleader
concept
it
is
that
you
have
inconsistent
claims
and
if
the
laws
of
the
two
states
were
substantially
different
so
that
it
would
be
possible
under
the
laws
of
both
states
for
both
states
to
be
right,
i
am
not
sure
in
my
own
mind
that
the
court
would
then
appropriately
exercise
jurisdiction
to
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
well
i
say
--
if
it
would
entertain
jurisdiction
it
would
have
no
basis
for
choosing
between
the
two
other
than
to
pick
the
law
that
made
the
most
sense.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
think
you
are,
as
part
of
the
original
jurisdiction
but
i
want
to
stress
that
i
do
not
believe
texas
contends
that,
that
is
the
case
here.
the
law
of
the
two
states,
really
the
law
of
the
nation
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
well
i
think
that
it
is
the
law
of
the
states
here,
of
all
fifty
states
i
believe
that
defined
domicile
in
the
same
way.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
think
that
there
would
be
no
due
process
objection
to
other
basis
for
taxation
and
i
think
there
are
cases
that
support
that
statement;
however
the
laws
of
texas
and
california
that
have
been
invoked
by
our
respective
states
do
not
assert
taxes
on
any
other
basis.
the
basis
for
taxation
in
texas
and
the
basis
for
taxation
in
california
that
brings
us
here
is
domicile.
so
i
do
not
think
that
we
have
to
reach
that
question,
that
is
what
we
are
--
that
is
not
what
we
are
attempting
to
do.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
yes
i
think
–
i
think
there
are
many.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
yes
i
think
you
are
fashioning
a
federal
rule,
i
assume
that
the
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
only
that
i
do
not
have
to
because
there
is
no
conflict
between
(inaudible)--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
think
it
demonstrates
that
an
appropriate
in
the
nature
of
interpleader
action
because
the
claims
are
identical,
you
have
two
claims
that
cannot
both
be
right
as
an
independent
matter
and
therefore
it
is
an
appropriate
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
do
think
that
if
you
were
confronted
with
a
situation
in
which
the
laws
of
the
states
were
different
and
it
conflict
--
then
you
would
have
to.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
think
that
is
the
answer,
i
think
the
escheat
case
is
following
western
union
v.
pennsylvania
are
perfect
example
of
case
in
which
in
the
court
made
a
decision
which
has
to
be
federal
in
its
origin
as
to
which
rule
of
escheat
would
govern
the
resolution
of
those
several
state
conflicts.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
think
that
is
the
same,
i
think
that
the
same.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
have
not
contended
that
and
i
do
not
think
it
is
necessary
to
do
so
because
the
laws
of
the
two
states
base
their
tax
on
that
ground.
we
are
not
challenging
the
basis
for
the
texas
tax
other
than
its
factual
basis.
i
mention
western
union
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
think
that
is
not
so.
i
am
no
expert
on
texas
law,
but
i
have
followed
their
domicile
trial
here
and
of
course
i
have
read
texas
v.
florida
and
that
case
was
initiated
by
texas,
and
it
found
its
law
to
be
the
same
as
the
other
three
states
and
i
read
that
the
papers
there
and
i
understood
it
to
be
the
texas
law
then
and
i
think
now
was
in
agreement
really
with
the
common
law
of
the
fifty
states
of
the
union
on
domicile.
i
am
really
aware
of
no
difference.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
am
confident
that
they
--
well
at
least
we
know
this,
we
know
that
a
jury
in
texas
has
rendered
a
verdict
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
position
california
asserts
now
we
are
here
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
cannot
tell
you
what
the
californian
courts
will
do
anymore
than
texas
could
in
texas
v.
florida,
that
litigation
of
course
came
here
before
any
litigation
had
occurred
in
any
state
and
the
court
rejected
justice
frankfurter's
suggestion
that
it
was
premature
i
had
mentioned
the
first
of
the
considerations
and
the
second
one
has
to
do
with
western
union
and
i
think
western
union
is
an
important
case
here.
in
our
view,
for
reasons
set
forth
in
our
papers
in
some
detail,
we
think
western
union
took
texas
v.
florida
one
more
step
and
made
the
exercise
of
this
court's
jurisdiction
mandatory
and
not
simply
optional.
in
cases
where,
and
they
are
rare,
where
two
or
more
states
seek
to
tax
the
state
beyond
the
point
of
confiscation.
i
have
read
and
reread
texas's
reply
on
that
point
and
i
do
not
understand
that
they
seem
to
contend
that
western
union
is
distinguishable
because
it
involves
the
dispute
over
property,
the
location
of
which
was
in
question
whereas
here
in
texas
v.
florida
the
property
is
located
within
the
borders
of
texas
and
thus
it
has
exclusive
interim
jurisdiction
over
the
property
and
for
most
part
that
is
in
this
state
consists
of
stock
in
a
corporation
which
will
be
taxed
in
the
place
of
domicile
and
so
texas's
position
assumes
the
answer
to
the
question
that
has
to
be
litigated.
that
really
is
the
same
problem
as
there
was
in
western
union
and
the
court
said
in
that
case
that
pennsylvania
lacked
jurisdiction.
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law
lacked
jurisdiction
to
proceed
because
it
could
not
assure
western
union
that
it
would
not
be
liable
inconsistently
to
the
escheat
demands
of
other
states.
i
think
that
one
passage
in
the
court's
opinion
on
that
point
is
quite
significant.
the
court
said,
the
situation
here
in
western
union
is
in
all
material
respects
like
that
which
caused
us
to
take
jurisdiction
in
texas
versus
florida.
so,
as
we
read
western
union
and
as
we
read
it
today,
that
decision
obliged
us
and
indeed
obliged
--
obliged
texas
to
come
to
this
court
rather
than
to
proceed
in
our
own
state
court's.
once
it
became
clear
that
tax
claims
were
being
asserted
in
excess
of
the
amount
of
the
state.
finally,
another
factor,
i
want
to
mention
just
briefly
that
brought
us
here
and
i
think
it
is
important
for
this
this
court's
exercise
of
jurisdiction
was
our
own
sense
of
fairness
to
have
proceeded
independently
to
litigate
the
tax
claim
in
our
own
court's
as
texas
sought
to
do,
even
if
we
could
do
so,
western
union
not
withstanding,
simply
did
not
comport
with
our
notion
of
a
fair
and
appropriate
process.
it
seemed
to
us
that
it
would
be
incredibly
inefficient
to
generate
multiplicitous
litigation
which
would
only
degenerate,
into
a
--
but
it
really
would
be
a
three
ring
circus,
without
a
ring
master
there
would
be
litigation
in
california,
texas,
and
if
it
had
a
delaware
--
all
proceeding
without
any
ability
to
achieve
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
well,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
do
not
pretend
to
have
been
looking
out
for
the
welfare
of
the
areas
that
--
we
were
here,
and
acted
of
course
in
interest
of
the
tax
payers
of
california
but
it
does
seem
to
us
that
it
is
appropriate
for
governmental
officials,
taxing
officials
to
be
concerned
with
the
fairness
of
there
conduct.
after
all,
we
are
accountable
to
that
sort
of
standards
as
well
and
it
seem
to
us
that
all
of
the
decisions
that
are
relevant
in
this
court
and
all
of
the
literature
in
the
last
four
years
in
texas
versus
florida
condemned
that
a
process
by
which,
and
a
state
can
be
wiped
out
by
inconsistent
domicile
litigation
in
several
states.
that
strikes
me
as
unfair.
it
strikes
--
i
think
it
ought
to
strike,
the
court
is
unfair.
i
think,
it
would
strike
the
public
as
unfair
and
we
chose
not
to
do
it
for
all
of
the
reasons
that
i
have
suggested
and
i
do
not
mean
to
be
sanctimonious
about
it.
i
think
it
was
an
appropriate
factor
for
us
to
consider.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
yes,
i
am.
the
position
of
texas
as
i
understand
is
that
our
agreement
demonstrates,
in
some
fashion,
that
we
are
here
suing
on
behalf
of
private
citizens
and
not
on
behalf
of
a
state
and
that
makes
relevant,
small
number
of
cases
new
hampshire
versus
louisiana,
oklahoma
ex
rel.
johnson
versus
cook,
which
disentitled
a
state
to
do
so.
on
really,
on
the
ground
of
the
eleventh
amendment
and
it
is
a
limitation
on
the
court's
jurisdiction.
that
position
of
texas
is
both
factually
and
legally
unsound
here.
there
are
two
cases
on
that
point
that
i
want
to
call
to
the
court's
attention.
one
is
cited
in
our
reply
brief.
south
dakota
versus
north
carolina,
where
the
court
distinguished
those
earlier
cases
in
a
situation
in
which
a
small
number
of
bonds
of
the
state
had
been
assigned
to
south
dakota
and
they
have
been
assigned
unconditionally.
the
motive
of
the
donor
was
perfectly
apparent
from
writings
that
are
cited
in
the
court's
opinion.
he
brought
that
suit
for
reasons
of
his,
or
he
made
that
donation
for
reasons
of
his
own.
the
court
said
motive
of
the
donor
is
irrelevant,
south
carolina
--
south
dakota
is
suing
for
interests,
however
small
of
its
own
and
the
action
can
be
maintained.
another
case
not
cited
in
our
brief
but
i
do
want
to
call
of
the
court's
attention
is
north
dakota
versus
minnesota
in
263
us
at
365
and
then
another
opinion
at
584.
there
a
suit
was
brought
by
one
state
complaining
of
flooding
caused
by
the
acts
of
the
neighboring
state.
the
loss
caused
by
the
flooding
did
millions
of
dollars
of
damage
to
private
lands
in
the
plaintiff
state
and
something
like
$5000
of
damages
to
the
states
on
bridges
and
highways
as
i
recall.
the
court
allowed
the
act
even
though
the
interest
of
the
state
was
rather
small
and
even
though
it
noted
in
the
second
of
the
two
opinions
that
the
land
owners
of
the
plaintiff
state
who
had
been
affected
by
the
flooding
and
i
quote
“raised
a
fund
to
conduct
a
litigation”
i
think
it
is
apparent
that
in
that
case
the
state
was
induced
to
act
by
the
private
citizens
who
stood
to
benefit.
thus,
as
i
read
the
case,
as
the
state
may
sue
in
this
court,
not
withstanding
that
private
citizens
are
benefited
and
even
though,
private
citizens
induce
the
lawsuit.
now,
having
said
all
that
i
want
to
say,
that
that
is
not
what
happened
here.
the
record
before
this
court,
i
refer
to
an
affidavit
that
i
have
filed
at
the
time
of
the
application
for
a
preliminary
injunction
shows
that
the
decision
to
file
the
suit
was
made
several
weeks
before
we
had
had
any
conversation
whatever
with
the
state
on
the
subject
of
settlement
and
in
fact
general
hill,
i
am
sure
will
acknowledge,
i
personally
told
him
in
a
meeting
that
i
had
with
him
in
austin,
texas
on
october
21,
three
weeks
before
this
settlement
and
before
we
had
any
conversation
with
the
state
whatsoever
that
we
had
intended
to
initiate
suit
in
this
court
that
we
were
drafting
papers
and
so
forth.
so,
i
think
that
the
suggestion
that
we
here
carrying
the
bag
for
the
state
acting
for
its
benefit
is
just
plainly
false
as
a
factual
matter.
i
have
just
a
few
moments
left
and
i
would
like
to
save
that
time
for
rebuttal,
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions
to
meet
this
time.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
yes
i
do
mr
chief
justice.
first
of
all
let
me
say
that
there
is
no
doubt,
i
agree
with
some
of
the
implications,
some
of
the
question,
there
is
no
other
forum.
if
california
and
texas
each
secure
a
judgment
then
we
find
ourselves
in
that
situation
that
general
hill
contemplates.
there
is
no
possibility
absent
consent
of
both
states
of
litigating
that
in
the
delaware
courts.
they
have
no
jurisdiction
to
decide
controversies
between
states,
only
this
court
does
and
as
to
everybody
else
those
two
state
judgments
are
entitled
to
full
faith
in
credit
as
texas
v.
florida,
as
the
previous
cases,
make
clear.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
justice
stewart
i
suppose
the
court
could
go
beyond
the
pleadings
and
resolve
the
question
of
where
he
was
domiciled.
it
is
true
that
the
pleading
only
asks
the
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
texas
claim
is
a
valid
one
and
the
reason
for
that
is
as
someone
in
the
court
commented
a
moment
ago
that
we
have
settled
with
your
state
the
controversy
vis-a-vis
nevada,
the
bahamas,
mexico--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
no,--
he
spent
about
38
years
in
california.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
then
the
last,
i
am
sorry.
the
last
three
or
four
years
were
in
nevada.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
parties
recognized
a
very
complex
controversy
close
question
on
that
issue--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
do
not
think
the
court
has
to
do
it
to
adjudicate
this
to
finally
resolve
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
but
the
problem
here
was
that
we
were
facing
a
very
complex
litigation
with
many
alternatives.
we
undertook
to
settle
that
litigation.
we
could
have
settled
all
of
it
but
texas
was
not
party
to
it,
did
not
choose
to
be.
we
settled
all
that
we
could
and
we
have
this
remaining
part
of
the
problem
that
has
to
be
adjudicated--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
think
we
are
going
to
put
on
evidence
that
will
make
it
possible
for
the
master
to
make
that--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
well,
i
think
we
are
going
to
show
that
he
was
domiciled
in
california
for
at
least
30
or
40
years
of
his
life,
whether
it
is
necessary
to
go
on
and
disprove
the
contention,
that
in
1966
when
he
moved
to
las
vegas.
he
then
changed
his
domicile
to
nevada.
i
do
not
know
that
we
have
to
do
that.
once
we
have
disproved
the
texas
domicile
i
think
we
will
have
done
enough
but
we
will
be
prepared
to
do
the
other
as
well.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
it
would
not
be
sufficient
but
for
the
fact
that
the
state
has
agreed
to
pay
us
a
tax
if
we
can
make
that
showing.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
am
sorry
i
did
not
follow
your
question
mr
justice.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
well
not
as
taxing
authorities,
the
state.
no,
the
state
agreed
to
pay
us
a
tax
and
in
an
affect
to
abandon
this
it
is
defense
to
the
state
of
california.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
am
sorry
that
it
was
not
mr
justice
stewart.
to
pay
california
a
tax
if
we
can
establish
that
they
are
also
not
liable
to
texas
and
in
so
doing
abandoned
the
defense
that
they
otherwise
had
available
that
he
was
a
bahamian
or
a
mexican
or
a
citizen
of
the
world
or
a
citizen
of
nevada.
the
domiciliary
actions.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
we
in
fact
did
that
is
why
i
went
to
texas--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
texas
said
no.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
certainly
did.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
no,
no
they
are
not
right
mr
justice.
we
had
decided
to
bring
this
lawsuit,
had
the
papers
prepared
before
this
settlement
was
even
discussed.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
well
then
we
would
have
a
settlement.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
jurisdiction
turns
on
that
question
we
are
quite
prepared
to
amend
our
pleading
to
ask
the
court
to
do
just
that.
and
we
were
originally
planing
on
doing
just
that
papers
were
drafted
that
asked
the
court
to
do
that,
papers
had
even
been
sent
to
the
printer
asking
the
court
to
do
that
without
discussion
of
a
settlement
because
none
had
been
discussed
and
we
then
entered
into
negotiations
with
your
state
and
narrowed
the
issue
that
is
what
happened
and
i
fail
to
see
how
that
can
alter
the
need
to
have
a
unitary
adjudication.
this
is
the
only
place
to
go
for
that
adjudication.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
but
for
the
settlement
we
would
be
entitled
to
collect
no
domicile
based
tax.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
no
under
the
agreement
if
nevada
were
found
to
be
the
domicile
the
state
has
in
effect
settled
that
controversy
where
they
have
agreed
to
pay
us
an
18%
tax
not
withstanding
that.
so
that
would
be
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
no,
we
compromised,
our
rate
is
24%.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
yes
you
are
right.
and--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
texas,
if
they
found
nevada,
texas
will
of
course
not
recover
either
if
and
that
reflects
a
compromise
from
24%
to
18%.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
that
is
true,
of
course
that
is
always
true
if
in
a
domicile
kind
of
regime
falls
in
nevada
and
the
other.
certainly
we
are
here
with
a
very
complex--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
if
they
are
found
to
be
nevada
domiciliaries.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
18%.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
we
do
not
know
the
value
of
the
estate.
it
is
a
substantial
sum.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
am
not
really
qualified
to
say.
i
suppose
the
irs
has
the
final
say
on
that,
i
think
the
answer
is
yes.
the
state
and
we
have
agreed
to
resolve
that
part
of
the
controversy
and
we
have
compromised
our
tax.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
kind
of
situation
can
happen
in
settlements,
for
example
if
you
settle
a
lawsuit
with
several
parties
involved
and
some
settle
out,
that
settlement
is
valid
even
though
other
parties
do
not
settle
the
litigation
proceeds
and
there
is
a
adverse
determination
to--
.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
think
they
would
have
no
remedy,
i
think
that
is
correct
and
i
think
they
have
no
remedy
and
they
would
be
in
that
position
because
they
made
a
decision
to
opt
for
a
lower
tax
rate
and
to
abandon
defenses
that
were
otherwise
available.
i
think
that
was
a
choice
that
they
made
knowingly
and
they
will
have
to
pay
the
consequences
if
that
is
what
it
turns
out,
i
do
not.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
did
not
know
that
mr.
justice.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
well
i
think.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
it
is
not
the
bulk
of
the
estate
but
there
are
substantial
assets
in
california.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
no,
mr.
justice
i
am
in
private
practice,
i
am
special
counsel
for
the
state
of
california
in
this
matter.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
absolutely
not
and
i
have
filed
a
sworn
affidavit
with
this
court
which
was
presented
to
justice
powell
and
i
think
referred
to
the
entire
court
which
i
set
forth
under
penalty
of
perjury
that
this
decision
was
made
and
i
will
go
further
and
say
that
the
papers
were
prepared
and
ready
to
be
filed,
they
were
almost
ready
to
go,
they
were
at
the
printer
before
we
had
any
discussion
whatever
with
the
estate
on
the
subject
of
settlement
so
the
charge
is
just
false.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
that
is
correct.
now
as
i
say
we
would
be
--
if
we
thought
it
were
necessary,
if
the
court
finds
it
necessary,
we
were
prepared
it
to
amend
in
and
to
take
our
chances
with
the
broader
question.
i
see
no
purpose
to
be
served
by
that,
the
state
has
made
its
decision
and
we
have
agreed
to
accept
the
lower
rate
of
tax
in
settlement
of
that
aspect
of
the
case
and
it
seems
to
us
that
it
serves
the
benefit
of
everyone
to
narrow
the
issue.
we
have
really
only
one
problem
left,
i
thought
that
was
a
constructive
thing
to
do.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
if
that
is,
your
statement
is
absolutely
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
yes
i
think
that
correct.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
think
that
is
a
fair
statement
mr.
chief
justice.
