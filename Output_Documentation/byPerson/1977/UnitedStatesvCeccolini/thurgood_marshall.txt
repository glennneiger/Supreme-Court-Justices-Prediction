justice

did
he
release

justice
thurgood

this
is
wire-taped

this
wire-tapping?
justice
thurgood

this
is
some
different
then.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
is
particularly
the
wire-tapped
conversation.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
allen
you
told
the
chief
justice
that
all
the
judge
was
doing,
“
taking
out
loud”

the
--
my
brother
stewart
is
trying
to
find
out.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
there
is
not
a
judgment
you
do
not
have
a
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
there
is
no
judgment
the
court
of
appeal
did
not
have
jurisdiction
and
we
do
not
have
jurisdiction.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
had
not
once
said
a
piece
of
paper,
i
said
a
final
judgment,
and
i
am
still
looking
for
the
final
judgment.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
any
case
that
you
have
this
is
a
(inaudible)
is
a
final
judgment?
justice
thurgood

mr.
greenspan,
in
the
docket
entry
as
which
i
assume
you
have
a
copy
of?
justice
thurgood
marshall
on
021976
“filed
government
notice
of
appeal
from
decisions
of
judge
gagliardi
setting
aside
verdict
on
count
1”
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
a
judgment
or
not?
what
is
it,
it
is
a
docket
entry?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
you
file
a
judgment
do
not
you
put
that
into
docket
entry?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
lets,
well
it
says
counts
found
the
defendant
gave
the
count
one
not
guilty
of
verdict
on
count
two,
count
one
is
set
aside,
bail
exonerated,
gagliardi
j?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
was
a
court
trial
without
a
jury.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
had
no
significance
to
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
do
not
expect
me
to
take
the
same
position
you
do
or
not
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
recognized
a
difference
between
the
judge
trial
and
the
jury
trial.
justice
thurgood
marshall
permit
me
if
i
may
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
he
could
have
solved
all
of
it
by
sealing
up
the
envelope.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean
he
could
have,
your
client.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
by
telling
the
truth.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
before
justice
gagliardi;
judge
gagliardi
mentioned
it
in
his
order.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
could
he
mention
if
he
did
not
about
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
imagine
under
your
estoppel
that
once
the
policeman
went
in
there,
looked
at
an
envelope
your
man
could
never
be
be
prosecuted
by
anybody
for
anything?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
hope
not.
justice
thurgood

she
was
a
science
teacher,
why
is
she
studying
police?
justice
thurgood
marshall
before
she
testified.
justice
thurgood
marshall
she
was
engaged
in
something
that
was
bad
and
he
was
too.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
that
in
the
evidence
to
say
that
the
government
used
that
as
basis
for
talking
to
her?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
else?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
four
months
later
they
talked
to
her.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
got
a
connection
four
months.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
agree
that
he
had
admitted
it
was
a
judgment.
justice
thurgood
marshall
second
one
on
writ
said
that,
that
is
what
we
are
appealing.
