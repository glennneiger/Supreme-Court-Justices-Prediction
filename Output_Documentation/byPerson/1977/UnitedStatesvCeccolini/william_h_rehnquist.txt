is
something
like
a
judgment

judgment,
you

is
a
judgment.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
is
a
criminal
conviction
which
was
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
in
new
york
and
we
granted
certiorari
to
review
that
judgment.
the
facts
are
these.
while
conducting
an
admittedly
illegal
search,
a
police
officer
in
north
tarrytown,
new
york,
just
above
the
tappan
zee
bridge
discovered
that
one
of
the
criminal
defendant
in
the
cases,
employees
in
a
place
called
appropriate
enough
the
sleepy
hollow
flower
shop
had
knowledge
concerning
betting
operations
in
which
the
defendant
was
suspected
of
being
a
participant.
later
the
defendant
testified
before
a
grand
jury
that
he
was
not
involved
in
any
gambling
operations.
when
the
employee
testified
to
the
contrary,
the
defendant
was
indicted
for
perjury.
after
a
bench
trial
at
which
the
employee
again
testified,
the
defendant
was
found
guilty
by
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
new
york.
that
court
then
granted
the
defendant's
motion
to
suppress
the
testimony
of
the
employee
because
it
was
the
product
of
an
illegal
search
and
he
set
--
the
the
district
judge
set
aside
the
verdict.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
district
court's
ruling
concluding
there
was
enough
connection
between
the
officer's
search
of
the
flower
shop
and
the
employees'
testimony
at
trial
to
justify
the
exclusion.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals.
in
determining
whether
suppression
of
live
witness
testimony
such
as
this
is
proper,
a
court
must
consider
among
other
things,
the
degree
of
free
will
exercised
by
the
witness
and
the
fact
that
exclusion
of
the
witness'
testimony
would
perpetually
disable
the
witness
from
testifying.
in
the
light
of
these
considerations,
the
exclusionary
rule
should
be
invoked
with
much
greater
reluctance
where
a
claim
is
based
on
a
casual
relationship
between
a
constitutional
violation
and
the
discovery
of
a
live
witness
than
when
a
similar
claim
is
advanced
to
support
suppression
of
an
inanimate
object.
evaluated
in
this
light,
the
evidence
in
this
case
indicates
that
the
link
between
the
illegal
search
and
the
employees'
testimony
at
trial
was
sufficiently
attenuated
to
dissipate
the
taint.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
mr.
justice
marshall
whom
mr.
justice
brennan
joins
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
justice
blackmun
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
