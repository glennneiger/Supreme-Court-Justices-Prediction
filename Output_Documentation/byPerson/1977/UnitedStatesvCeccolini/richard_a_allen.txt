mr.
richard
a.
allen
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
two
important
issues
concerning
the
scope
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
the
facts
in
the
case
are
not
complicated.
briefly
respondent
mr.
ceccolini
owned
and
operated
a
flower
shop
in
tarrytown,
new
york
where
he
conducted
a
gambling
business
by
taking
bets
on
numbers
and
sporting
events
from
customers
and
turning
over
the
proceeds
to
one
in
man
named
francis
millow.
in
1973
the
fbi
conducted
a
visual
surveillance
of
respondent's
flower
shop
and
concluded
that
the
shop
was
being
used
as
a
drop
spot
or
pick
up
spot
for
a
numerous
operation.
in
december
1973
however
the
fbi
surveillance
was
discontinued,
a
year
later
in
december
1974
a
local
policeman
officer
ronald
biro,
took
a
break
from
his
school
patrol
duties
and
went
in
to
the
shop
for
a
cigarette
break
and
went
behind
the
counter
and
sat
down
and
struck
up
a
conversation
with
lois
hennessey,
a
sales
women
who
had
been
employed
in
the
shop
for
about
a
year.
respondent
was
not
in
the
shop
at
that
time.
while
officer
biro
was
sitting
down,
taking
a
break
and
talking
to
miss
hennessey,
he
noticed
on
top
of
the
cash
register
an
envelope,
an
unsealed
envelope,
it
had
some
money
sticking
out
it
and
apparently
for
no
other
reason
than
curiosity,
he
looked
in
the
envelope
and
saw
in
the
envelope
money
and
what
appeared
to
him
to
be
gambling
slips.
and
he
put
the
envelope
back,
he
closed
the
envelope
and
put
it
back
on
top
of
the
cash
register.
office
biro
did
not
tell
miss
hennessey
what
he
had
seen
in
the
envelope
and
she
testified
later
that
she
did
not
know
what
was
in
the
envelope.
he
did
however
ask
miss
hennessey,
who
the
envelope
was
for
and
she
told
that
the
respondent
had
given
it
to
her
to
give
to
somebody
later
that
day,
but
she
did
not
say
who
and
he
did
not
ask
her.
officer
biro
was
unaware
at
that
time
that
the
respondent
had
been
under
investigation
for
gambling
activities
but
the
next
day
he
did
tell
his
fellow
officers
at
the
local
police
station
what
he
had
seen
in
this
shop
and
they
in
turn
informed
one
of
the
fbi
agents
who
had
conducted
the
earlier
surveillance
that
officer
biro
had
seen
some
gambling
slips
in
this
shop
and
that
apparently
miss
hennessey
appeared
to
know
something
about
it.
four
months
later
in
april,
1975,
the
fbi
agent
interviewed
miss
hennessey
at
her
home
and
the
record
is
quite
clear
that
she
freely
and
willingly
undertook
to
disclose
to
the
fbi
agent,
her
considerable
knowledge
about
respondent’s
gambling
activities.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
no
not,
it
is
not
entirely
clear
your
honor
but
would
appear
to
be
simply
the
course
of
the
gambling
investigation.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
it
is
conceded
in
the
sense
that
we
would
not
contend
that
he
would
inevitably
have
interviewed
her
but
for
that
incident.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
innocence,
it
crops
with
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
right
your
honor,
it
is
a
fruit
of
the
search
in
the
sense
that
it
is
reasonable
to
conclude
that
he
would
not
have
interviewed
but
for
the
fact
that
the
surveillance
–
mr.
richard
a.
allen
it
is
not
an
issue
except
that
it
is
also
reasonable
to
conclude
that
he
may
have
interviewed
her
later
and
that
reasonable,
that
conclusion
that
seems
to
us
to
indicate
that
despite
of–-
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
right
he
might
have.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
pardon
me.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
we
are
not
contending
that
he
inevitably
would
have
but
that
he
might
have.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
it
is
not
unreasonable
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
a
very
good
possibility
your
honor
but
we
can
not
prove
it
for
with
assertion,
we
do
not
know
what
would
have
happened
if
some
different
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
right,
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
after
respondent
was
indicted
but
not
before.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
in
may
of
1970,
four
months
later,
the
respondent
was
subpoena
to
appear
before
the
grand
jury
and
he
unequivocally
denied
under
oath
that
he
had
ever
taken
gambling
bets
from
his
customers
either
for
himself
or
for
mr.
millow
or
that
he
ever
had
discussed
gambling
operations
for
mr.
millow.
respondent
was
then
indicted
for
purgery
before
the
grand
jury
and
he
waived
his
right
to
a
jury
trial,
and
he
was
tried
before
judge
gagliardi.
the
government’s
principal
evidence
in
this
purgery
trial
was
a
testimony
of
lois
hennessey
who
testified
in
some
detailed
about
respondents
gambling
activities
over
the
year
of
her
employment
with
mr.
millow.
at
the
end
of
the
trial,
judge
gagliardi
entered
a
finding
of
guilt
on
one
count
of
the
purgery
indictment
against
mr.
ceccolini.
judge
gagliardi
then
considered
the
respondent’s
motion
to
suppress
the
testimony
of
miss
hennessey
that
respondent
had
made
at
the
outset
of
the
trial
but
that
judge
with
respondent’s
consent
had
deferred
pending
the
trial.
the
judge
then
granted
respondent’s
suppression
motion
on
the
grounds
that
the
testimony
of
miss
hennessey
was
the
tainted
fruit
of
officer
biro’s
search
and
he
then
set
aside
his
finding
of
guilt
on
the
ground
that
without
her
testimony
there
was
insufficient
evidence
to
convict
respondent
of
perjury.
although
the
court
granted
the
government’s
petition
raising
two
exclusionary
rule
issues,
respondent’s
principal
argument
is
that
the
government’s
appeal
in
this
case
was
barred
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
we
believe
that
that
argument,
that
the
respondent’s
double
jeopardy
argument
is
clearly
foreclosed
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
united
states
versus
wilson
and
united
states
versus
jenkins
and
united
states
versus
martin
lennon
which
hold
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
not
implicated
unless
there
is
a
possibility
of
a
retrial
in
the
general
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence.
and
that
possibility
does
not
exist
in
this
case;
if
the
government
prevails
judge
gagliardi’s
finding
of
guilt
may
simply
be
reinstated.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor.
the
trial
judge
in
this
case
ruled
that
without
the
tainted
evidence,
there
was
insufficient
evidence
of
guilt,
if
for
the
reversal---
mr.
richard
a.
allen
it
is
difficult
to
visualize
your
honor,
i
would
not
think
so,
i
would
think
that
in
fact
if
it
was
appropriate
if
the
court
concluded
that
some
of
her
testimony
was
admissible
but
some
was
not,
i
should
think
if
they
would
have
be
open
to
the
district
court
simply,
for
directions
of
the
district
court
simply
to
consider
whether
the
admissible
portion
of
her
testimony
as
well
as
the
other
testimony
in
the
case
was
sufficient
to
support
a
verdict
of
finding
a
guilt.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
right
he
concluded
that
the
evidence
without
her
testimony
was
insufficient.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
right,
it
would
be
a
essentially
a
question
of
law
for
him
though
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
visualize
what
portion
of
her
evidence
might
be
admissible
if
some
of
that
was
not
admissible
but
in
any
event
--.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
he
set
aside
the
finding
of
guilt,
but
i
think
your
recitation
is
some
what
inaccurate
mr.
justice
stewart,
what
he
did
was
he,
at
the
beginning
of
the
trial,
at
the
end
he
indicated
that
at
the
beginning
of
the
trial
he
had
concluded
that
the
search
was
unlawful.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
and
that
therefore
the
tangible
evidence
of
the
search
that
is
the
envelope
and
what
it
contained
would
not
be
considered
by
him
but
he
made
no
ruling
until
after
his
finding
with
respect
to
whether
miss
hennessey’s
testimony
should
be
suppressed
of
the
fruit.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
after
his
finding
of
guilt---
mr.
richard
a.
allen
he
then
considered
that
point.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
i
therefore
set
aside
the
finding
of
guilt,
his
procedure
in
this—
mr.
richard
a.
allen
he
did
not
enter
a
formal
motion
of
judgment
of
acquittal
and
it
is
therefore
it
would
be
inaccurate
if
the
respondent
tries
to
characterize
it
as
a
grant
of
a
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal.
it
seems
to
us
it
is
more
equivalent
to
the
procedure
that
was
engaged
in
the
united
states
versus
morrison
where
the
trial
judge
after
making
a
finding
of
guilt,
then
considered
a
suppression
motion,
granted
the
suppression
motion
and
said
i
am
going
to
take
appropriate
action
depending
on
what
the
appellate
courts
do
with
my
motion.
supreme
court
concluded
that
his
grant
on
suppression
motion
was
err
and
he
simply
then
reinstated
his
finding
of
guilt,
in
that
case
it
would
not
be
judgment
of
acquittal,
seems
to
me
that
this
case
is
somewhat
analogous
to
that.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
there
is
no
order,
it
was—
mr.
richard
a.
allen
what
he
said
appears
in
the
appendix
of
the
petition.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
would
be
very
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
he
did
release
the
man.
on
page
32a
of
the
appendix
to
our
petition
the
judge
says
all
of
the
collaborating
evidence
particularly
the
wire-tapped
conversion
is
strong
when
coupled
with
lois
hennessey’s
testimony
standing
by
itself
it
is
insufficient
to
prove
ceccolini’s
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
he
goes
on
to
say
that
the
foregoing
constitutes
the
court’s
conclusions
of
fact
and
findings
of
the
fact
and
conclusions
of
law,
and
mr.
ceccolini
was
released
on
his
own
recognizance.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
no
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
the
wire-tap
i
believe
refers
to
a
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
i
believe
that
the
wire-tapped
conversation
refers
to
a
conversation,
i
may
be
wrong
in
this
your
honor,
but
i
believe
it
refers
to
a
conversation
between
mr.
ceccolini
and
mr.
millow
in
which
mr.
millow
told
mr.
ceccolini
that
when
he
goes
before
the
grand
jury,
just
say
he
does
not
remember
anything,
i
may
be
incorrect
on
that
though
your
honor
but
there
was
additional
wire-tapped
evidence
in
the
case
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
miss
hennessey.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
no
your
honor
no
formal
written
order,
simply
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well
there
was
--
for
purposes
of
--
there
was
a
ruling
by
the
district
court,
a
grant
of
suppression
motion,
it
appears
orally
no
–
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well
there
is
no
formal
piece
of
paper
which
he
enters
a
formal
grant
of
suppression
motion
or
motion
for
judgment,
alright.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
and
more
than
that
your
honor,
he
made
a
rule
---
mr.
richard
a.
allen
he
made
a
ruling
on
the
record.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
apparently
your
honor,
there
is
no
piece
of
paper.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
thank
you,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
i
think
that
is
the
piece
of
paper
from
what
the
government
appeals,
i
apologize.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
that
judge
gagliardi
gave
a
the
suppression
motion
and
set
aside—
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well
frankly,
your
honor,
i
have
to
confess
ignorance
but
i
do
not
know
whether
an
appealable
judgment
requires
a
piece
of
paper.
in
an
ordinary
criminal
case
the
judgment
is
not
entered
until
the
defendant
is
is
sentenced.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
there
was
a
final
judgment—
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
i
may
not
be
understanding
your
honor
and
i
apologize
but
there
was
clearly,
it
was
clearly
a
final
judgment
on
respondent’s
suppression
motion
granting
that
motion
and
the
consequence
of
that
was
setting
aside
the
finding
of
guilt
and
it
is
my
understanding
if
that
is
an
appealable
ruling.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
no
your
honor
i
do
not
believe,
they
had
no
question
that
what
the
district
court
did
was
properly
appealable.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
correct
your
honor.
unless,
if
court
has
any
further
questions
on
this
matter,
to
which
i
am
afraid
i
can
not
elucidate
you
any
further.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
correct,
it
included
testimony
i
believe
about
the
events
on
december
18th
that
there
was
an
envelope
that
mr.
ceccolini
left
for
her
to
give
to
mr.
millow
but
it
was
not
on
the
merits
in
the
sense
that
she
testified.
she
did
not
know
what
was
in
the
envelope.
so
it
was
not
direct
evidence
of
respondent’s
gambling
activities,
perhaps
inferential
evidence.
well
the
thrust
of
her
---
mr.
richard
a.
allen
it
may
not
have
been
relevant,
arguable
it
was
relevant
as
creating
an
inference
that
it
was
simply
an
additional
instance
of
respondent’s
activities
with
mr.
millow.
the
thrust
of
her
testimony
was
about
other
events
and
other
activities
by—
mr.
richard
a.
allen
no
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
apparently
so
your
honor.
what
precisely,
the
judgment
was
that
they
had
in
mind,
i
have
to
confess
i
do
not
know
because
the
judge
never
did
formal
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
do
i
attach
significance
to
your
honor
i
understand
his
argument
but
i
think
it
lacks
merit
because
it
is
quite
clear
and
the
judge
quite
deliberately
indicated
that
the
procedure
he
followed
was
to
enter
first,
a
finding
of
guilt
and
then
to
set
to
aside,
even
if
what
he
did
is
setting
aside
of
the
finding
of
guilt
could
be
deemed
be
an
acquittal
which
i
do
not
believe,
it
is
fair
to
characterize
it.
even
if
that
were
true
the
double
jeopardy
clause
would
not
preclude
the
government’s
appeal.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
because
united
states
versus
martin
lennon,
and
those
case
have
made
quite
clear
that
double
jeopardy
clause
is
not
even
implicated
unless
there
is
a
possibility
of
a
retrial
and
i
think
in
united
states
versus
jenkins,
the
court
quite
expressly
said
that
when
there
is
a
verdict
of
guilt
and
after
that
there
is
a
judgment
of
acquittal
the
government
may
appeal.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
i
do
not
believe
your
honor,
in
united
states
versus
morrison
there
was
this
motion
for
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
correct,
your
honor
although,
whether
it
may
be
deemed
formerly
a
dismissal
of
the
indictment
or
not
i
think
the
court
is
made
clear
that
the
criminal
appeals
act
was
designed
to
give
the
government
a
right
to
appeal
in
every
case
where
the
double
jeopardy
clause
was
not
permitted
regardless
of
the
formalism
of
the
judgment.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
first
issue
that
our
petition
raises
is
whether
the
exclusionary
rule
requires
expression
of
evidence
in
connection
with
crimes
committed
after
the
evidence
is
obtained.
that
issue
is
simply
illustrated
by
the
facts
of
this
case.
officer
biro’s
excessive
curiosity
disclosed
information
about
gambling
activities
incriminating
to
mr.
ceccolini,
that
information
was
of
two
types.
first
it
was
tangible
evidence
of
gambling
activities,
and
second
it
was
information
that
miss
hennessey
appeared
to
know
something
about
it.
now
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
that
the
information,
at
least
the
tangible
evidence
that
officer
biro
discovered
could
not
be
admitted
in
any
prosecution
of
the
respondent
for
crimes
committed
before
that
search
took
place.
either
gambling
offenses
or
other
crimes,
the
only
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
exclusionary
rule
requires
the
information
that
he
discovered
to
be
suppressed
in
the
prosecution
of
purgery
that
took
place
5
months
after
his
search
took
place
and
our
position
is
very
simple
that
it
does
not.
the
purpose
of
the
exclusionary
rule
is
to
deter
police
misconduct
by
taking
away
their
incentives
and
it
is
very
difficult
to
see
how
policemen
would
have
much
incentive
to
search
for
evidence
of
a
crime
that
has
not
yet
taken
place
and
may
never
take
place.
and
even
if
a
policeman
did
have
much
incentive
in
that
respect
it
is
doubtful
that
the
exclusionary
rule
would
provide
much
significant
deterrence.
if
a
policeman
is
not
going
to
be
deterred
from
conducting
an
unlawful
search
by
the
prospect
of
jeopardizing
the
prosecution
of
a
crime
that
is
already
been
committed,
it
seems
very
unlikely
that
the
prospect
of
suppressing
evidence
of
a
future
crime
would
make
him
behave
any
differently.
and
in
any
event,
it
is
clear
from
the
facts
of
this
case
we
submit
that
officer
biro
was
not
at
all
motivated
by
desire
to
find
evidence
of
a
crime
that
had
not
yet
taken
place
or
evidence
upon
his
purgery
5
months
later.
officer
biro
testified
and
there
is
no
dispute
that
he
was
not
even
aware
at
that
time
the
respondent
was
engaged
in
a
gambling
activity.
well
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
applying
the
exclusionary
rule
to
the
subsequently
committed
crime.
the
issue
does
not
appear
to
arise
and
is
not
very
frequently,
where
we
have
only
three
other
cases
discussed
in
our
brief,
in
which
the
issue
is
arisen
and
in
all
of
those
decisions,
the
courts
held
evidence
was
admissible
the
issue
that
arises
far
more
frequently
is
a
second
issue
presented
in
this
case
which
is
whether
the
trial
testimony
of
lois
hennessey
should
be
considered
to
be
the
tainted
fruit
of
officer
biro's
search.
this
court
is
expressly
reserved
the
live
witness
testimony
question
in
previous
decisions
and
there
has
been
considerable
difference
in
the
opinion
among
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
matter.
that
issue
is
separate
and
independent
from
the
first
subsequent
crime
issue,
and
if
our
position
is
sustained
it
would
want
a
reversal
to
this
case
whatever
the
court
decided
on
the
subsequent
crime
issue.
in
this
case
it
appears
as
a
result
of
the
search
of
the
envelope
officer
biro
learned
that
hennessey
might
know
something
about
respondent’s
gambling
activity.
he
did
not
find
that
out
for
certain
and
he
did
not
know
what
if
anything
she
knew
about
it,
but
a
follow
up
interview
four
months
later
disclosed
that
she
had
considerable
knowledge
about
the
matter
and
was
perfectly
willing
to
cooperate
and
testify
about
it.
the
question
very
simply
is
whether
her
testimony,
a
trial
about
those
matters
is
excludable
as
the
fruit
of
officer
biro's
search.
ever
since
nardone
versus
united
states,
it
has
been
accepted
that
at
some
point
along
the
causal
chain
of
evidence
originating
from
some
illegality,
the
connection
between
the
evidence
developed
and
the
original
illegality
becomes
so
attenuated
as
to
dissipate
the
original
taint.
the
attenuation
doctrine
is
simply
an
application
of
the
basic
theory
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
at
some
point
an
item
of
evidence
derived
only
remotely
from
the
original
illegality
the
exclusion
of
that
evidence
is
not
going
to
significantly
deter
a
policeman.
so
the
question
in
each
case
is
where
in
that
causal
chain
the
attenuation
point
occurs.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
nardone
suggested
that
question
be
left
to
the
good
sense
of
judges
but
in
close
cases
judges
have
equally
good
sense
frequently
disagree.
so
this
court
has
established
a
number
of
guidelines
to
guide
federal
judges
in
that
determination.
with
respect
to
the
question
of
verbal
statements
made
after
an
arrest
for
example,
this
court
in
wong
sun
versus
united
states
and
brown
versus
illinois
defined
the
inquiry
as
whether
the
statement
is
sufficiently
a
product
of
free
will
as
to
break
the
causal
chain
between
that
statement
and
the
original
illegality
and
is
defined
as
relevant
to
that
inquiry,
a
number
of
factors
including
the
temporary
proximity
between
the
arrest
and
the
illegality,
the
presence
of
intervening
circumstances.
the
degree
to
which
the
police
exploited
the
original
illegality
and
finally
the
flagrancy
of
that
illegality.
the
trouble
is
that
those
considerations
just
do
not
apply
very
well
in
case
of
considering
--
in
considering
whether
the
testimony
of
a
witness
should
be
deemed
to
be
the
fruit
of
an
original
illegality
or
if
they
did
apply
they
would
indicate,
they
would
lead
to
the
conclusion
in
almost
every
case
we
submit
that
the
testimony
ought
to
be
admitted.
whether
the
testimony
of
a
witness
like
lois
hennessey
is
more
approximately
the
result
of
officer
biro’s
search
or
is
more
approximately
the
result
of
intervening
acts
of
free
will
by
herself
or
by
the
fbi
agent
who
decided
to
interview
her
or
by
the
prosecutor
who
decided
to
subpoena
her.
those
are
basically
philosophical
questions
that
are
un-resolveable
and
that
have
very
little
to
do
with
the
purpose
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
they
do
not
have
much
to
do
with
the
purpose
of
the
exclusionary
rule
because
essentially
they
focus
on
the
witness’s
state
of
mind
and
the
circumstances
occurring
after
the
police
search
took
place,
the
policeman's
conduct
took
place,
rather
then
on
those
things
that
might
have
motivated
the
police
to
engage
in
that
conduct
in
the
first
place.
furthermore
and
in
almost
every
case
the
decision
of
a
witness
to
testify
is
based
on
a
very
large
complex
of
motivations
and
circumstance
and
an
analysis
that
requires
the
court
to
try
to
figure
out
the
role
that
free
will
plays
in
that
decision
permits
court
to
come
to
almost
any
conclusion
that
they
desire
in
any
given
case,
as
we
thank
the
opinions
of
court
of
appeals
in
this
area
indicate.
those
reasons
we
think
the
live
witness
question
ought
to
be
decided
as
a
policy
matter.
a
policy
matter
that
looks
to
the
purpose
of
the
exclusionary
rule
and
very
simply,
a
question
which
inquires
whether
the
exclusion
of
a
witness’s
trial
testimony
is
likely
to
provide
enough
additional
deterrents
of
police
misconduct
outweigh
the
social
cost
of
exclusion.
and
while
there
is
not
much
empirical
data
on
the
matter,
there
really
is
in
not
in
exclusionary
rule
cases.
we
think
it
is
reasonable
to
conclude
that
the
police
have
significantly
less
incentive
to
engage
in
unconstitutional
conduct,
to
discover
the
name
of
a
possibly
potential
witness
than
to
obtain
tangible
evidence
or
verbal
fruits.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
no
your
honor
we
would
not.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
because
what
we
are
focusing
on
is.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
correct
but
the
attenuation
question
is
whether
the
evidence
we
seek
to
introduce
is
sufficiently
attenuated
from
the
primarily
illegality.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
no
there
are
many
intervening
circumstances
that
make
a
difference
between
her
ultimate
testimony
a
trial
and
whatever
she
may
say
to
a
policeman
who
comes
to
talk
to
her.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
a
tangible
evidence
could
be
used
in
proving
that
crime,
if
the
gambling
slips
themselves
were
admissible,
it
would
be
relevant
to
proving
that
crime.
our
point
is
that
apart
from
the
question
of
whether
exclusionary
rule
are
applied
to
subsequent
crimes,
it
should
not
apply
to
exclude
the
testimony
of
a
witness
and
we
think
the
testimony
of
a
witness
differs
for
attenuation
purposes
significantly
from
either
physical
evidence
or
the
example
of
mr.
justice
white
posed
which
is
the
statement
of
either
the
defendant
or
a
witness
made
in
the
course
of
a
police
investigation.
and
the
difference
is
between
--
the
statement
problem
is
a
difficult
problem
and
it
may
be
that
statements
made
by
witness
that
lead
to
further
things
that
those
ultimate
things
would
be
attenuated
under
traditional
attenuation
analysis
but
we
think
that
there
is
a
difference
in
kind
between
trial
testimony
and
other
kinds
of
evidence.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
including
statements
during
interrogation.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
i
do
not
believe
he
was,
in
fact,
i
am
fairly
certain
that
he
was
not.
in
summary
we
contend
that
there
are
two
separate
and
independent
grounds
warning
reversal
of
the
judgment
below
and
a
reinstatement
of
the
district
court
finding
of
guilt.
first
we
think
that
the
courts
erred
in
applying
the
exclusionary
rule
to
a
crime
committed
5
months
after
the
search
took
place
and
second,
we
believe
that
they
erred
in
suppressing
the
trial
testimony
of
a
witness
as
the
fruit
of
an
illegal
search.
i
would
like
to
reserve
whatever
time
remaining
i
have
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
address
the
point
that
mr.
justice
stevens
made
that
i
did
not
answer
very
adequately
with
respect
to
the
right
of
the
government
to
appeal
expression,
motion
and
the
requirement
that
there
be
a
judgment.
18
u.s.c.
section
3731
appears
to
me
to
permit
a
government
appeal
from
a
decision
granting
a
suppression
motion
even
after
a
finding
of
guilt
or
a
verdict
of
guilt
has
been
entered.
the
statute
says
an
appeal
by
the
united
state
shall
lie
to
court
of
appeals
from
a
decision
in
order
of
the
–
from
a
decision
or
order
of
a
district
court,
suppressing
or
excluding
evidence,
not
made
after
defendant
has
been
put
in
jeopardy
and
before
the
verdict
of
finding
on
an
indictment
or
information.
the
language
would
seem
to
imply
that
if
the
suppression
order
is
made
after
the
verdict
or
finding
of
guilt,
it
may
be
appealed,
if
the
decision
is
a
made
and
there
is
not
in
the
statute
any
requirement
of
that
decision
on
a
suppression
motion
being
the
form
of
a
judgment.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
correct
your
honor
and
in
morrison
(inaudible)
i
do
not
believe
that
there
was
what
you
would
call
a
judgment
in
the
case,
that
was
simply
a
decision
granting
a
suppression
motion.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
i
would
argue
that
it
was.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
yes
your
honor
i
would
argue
that.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
i
would
not
want
to
limit
it
to
the
second
paragraph
your
honor
because
i
think
it
could
be
argued
that
the
effect,
if
we
needed
to
argue,
i
think
we
could
argue
that
the
effect
of
judge
gagliardi's
decision
was
a
dismissal
of
the
indictment.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
would
not
be
necessary.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
would
not
be
necessary,
i
would
rely
primarily
on
the
second
paragraph
and
i
believe
that
the
language
clearly
gives
us
a
right
to
appeal.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
i
do
not
abandon
that
your
honor,
i
think
that
they
correctly
determined
that
they
were
reviewing
a
judgment.
