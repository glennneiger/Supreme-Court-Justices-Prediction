chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
76-1151,
united
states
versus
ceccolini,
mr.
allen.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
you
have
done
that
once
so
with
respect
to
the
exclusion
of
the
evidence,
we
have
been
talking
about,
has
it
not,
because
having
made
a
decision
in
general
then
he
reexamined
it
in
light
of
the
exclusion
as
part
of
the
of
the
evidence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
came
to
a
different
conclusion.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
if
course
--
that
justice
steven
was
hypothesizing
were
followed
for
some
reason,
he
would
merely
repeat
that
exercise
applying
it
to
a
different
set
of
the
facts.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
i
were
to
say
that
judge
was
just
doing
his
thinking
out
loud,
his
reasoning
processes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
with
this
evidence,
i
would
find
him
guilty,
without
this
evidence
i
can
not
find
him
guilty.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
he
did
find
him
guilty
first.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
did
not
say
i
would,
he
did
find
him
guilty
did
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
court
of
appeals
thought
so
did
they
make
any
reference
to
it
specifically?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
at
least
they
seemed
to
take
it
for
granted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
a
note
at
page
21a
before
leave
this
subject,
21a
of
the
appendix
to
you
petition
for
cert,
united
states
court
of
appeals
has
said
decreed
that
the
judgment
of
said
district
court
being
hereby
has
affirmed
for
the
second
circuit
itself
,there
is
judgment
in
this
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
there
not
be
a
difference
the
evidence
that
mr.
justice
white
is
speaking
of,
if
he
had
been
charged
with
a
substantive
offensive
of
gambling
and
the
evidence
that
she
had
pointed
to,
if
i
understand
this
hypothetical
where
a
number
of
lot
of
number
slips.
here
you
have
made
the
point
that
the
crime
is
a
crime
committed
5
months
later,
namely
the
crime
of
the
committing
purgery
before
a
grand
jury
which
no
tangible
evidences
has
any
relationship.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
greenspan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
there
is
any
difference?
with
respect
to
the
live
witness,
the
live
witness
may
not
give
any
testimony
at
all
even
after
taking
the
stand
and
taking
the
oath.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no
there
was
a
never
an
obligation
to
testify
but
they
may
take
certain
steps
that
will
put
an
absolute
barrier,
namely,
the
fifth
amendment.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
a
package
of
heroin
for
example.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
not
you
think
miss
hennessey
might
conceivable
have
taken
the
fifth
amendment
here
as
at
least
a
peripheral
participant
in
(inaudible)
and
better
in
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
after
the
officer
has
left
the
florist
shop
that
mrs.
hennessey
got
a
little
bit
nervous
and
thought
she
might
be
gone
into
this
unlawful
conduct
of
her
boss,
if
then
she
had
gone
to
the
telephone,
called
the
fbi
and
given
them
all
the
information
that
she
gave
the
agent
some
months
later.
would
you
be
making
these
arguments?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
just
one
minute
left
mr.
allen.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
unless
you
do
not
abandon
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
21a
of
the
appendix
to
your
petitions,
that
this
was
a
judgment.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

you
gentleman.

case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
