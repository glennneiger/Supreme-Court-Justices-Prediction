justice
potter
stewart
so
what
did
the
trial
judge
precisely
do
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
he
apparently
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
evidence
was
inadmissible
but
nonetheless
it
was
a
trial
proceeding
and
at
the
end
he
found
him,
he
said,
i
find
you
guilty
on
the
basis
of
all
the
evidence
but
then
he
very
--
immediately
thereafter
he
said
however
some
of
the
evidence
should
be
excluded
and
on
the
basis
of
the
admissible
evidence,
there
is
not
evidence
to
prove
you
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
therefore
i
do
what
--
what
do
he
do?
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
so
after
his
ruling,
finding
of
guilt?
justice
potter
stewart
but
then
he
said
---
justice
potter
stewart
however
miss
hennessey’s,
very
immediately
thereafter,
very
soon
thereafter,
however
i
find
that
miss
hennessey’s
testimony
was
inadmissible
and
on
the
basis
alone
of
the
admissible
evidence,
i
found
there
is
insufficient
evidence
to
sustain
a
verdict
of
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
i
therefore—
justice
potter
stewart
he
did
find,
he
did
not
enter
a
motion
of
acquittal.
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
was
the
---
where
is
the
order
appearing
in
the
appendix
or
it
does
not?
justice
potter
stewart
what
he
said
that
apparently
is
in
the
appendix?
