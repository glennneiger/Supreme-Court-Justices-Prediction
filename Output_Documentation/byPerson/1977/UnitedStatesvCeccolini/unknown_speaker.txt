unknown
speaker
does
the
record
show
what
led
down
to
interview
her
in
her
home?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
it
was
conceded
at
least
for
purposes
of
this
argument
that
the
--what
led
the
fbi
agents
to
interview
miss
hennessey
at
her
home
in
the
spring
of
1975
was
a
chain
of
events
that
stemmed
from
the
officer’s
finding
that
envelope
with
the
money
and
gambling
slips
and
during
a
cigarette
break,
is
not
that
conceded
arguendo?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words
the
interrogation
by
the
fbi
agents
was
a
fruit
of
the
unlawful
search
by
the
officer---
unknown
speaker
that
the
unlawfulness
of
the
search
is
also
is
given
in
this
case,
is
not
that
right?
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
conceded
and
that
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
he
might
have
interviewed
her
later
even
when
the
search
had
not
taken
place.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
one
of
your
arguments,
is
not
it?
that
is
one
of
your
arguments
but---
unknown
speaker
that
he
would
have
gotten
around
her
anyway?
unknown
speaker
might
have.
unknown
speaker
by
the
time
--
unknown
speaker
and
by
that
time
of
the
interview
or
at
least
by
that
time
of
the
grand
jury
appearance,
she
was
a
former
employee,
was
not
she?
unknown
speaker
did
the
fbi
interview
any
other
employees
or
any
other
former
employees?
unknown
speaker
but
not
before.
unknown
speaker
mr.
allen
would
the
double
jeopardy
argument
be
the
same
if
there
are
possibility
of
the
reversal
and
for
further
findings,
for
example,
to
determine
whether
the
trial
judge
had
relied
at
all
on
the
testimony
about
the
illegal
search
itself
or
something
like
that,
would
the
double
jeopardy
clause
--
is
that
a
problem
then?
unknown
speaker
but
i
am
suggesting
is,
suppose
we
agreed
with
them
as
to
some
of
the
evidence
being
tainted
but
not
all
that
he
excluded.
i
can
not
give
you,
for
example,
may
be
the
portions
of
her
testimony
that
did
not
relate
to
the
illegal
search
itself,
perhaps
that
should
be
received,
but
the
testimony
pertaining
to
the
illegal
search
should
have
been
excluded,
may
be
he
relied
on
that,
just
to
give
an
example.
would
you
then
have
a
double
jeopardy
problem.
unknown
speaker
and
it
will
be
permissible
in
your
view,
to
make
additional
findings
as
long
as
there
were
no
more
evidence
to
be
heard
and
said.
unknown
speaker
you
say
there
is
no
order
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
then
why
that
the
appellate—that
the
court
of
appeals
have
jurisdiction
there
was
no
order
from
the
district
court.
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
order
nor
judgment,
courts
of
appeals
have
jurisdiction
to
review
judgments,
orders
not
just
the
conversation
by
district
court.
unknown
speaker
you
should
have
the
content,
it
is
a
dismissal
of
an
indictment
for
there
will
be
a
proper
appeal.
it
is
an
order
of
dismissal
of
indictment
that
you
have
to
point
us
to
to
be
a
proper
statutory
appeal,
is
that
not
right?
unknown
speaker
i
have
just
one
factual
question
mr.
allen,
is
it
correct
that
miss
hennessey’s
testimony
included
testimony
describing
what
the
court
assumed
to
be
an
illegal
search
itself
,
if
the
testimony
on
the
merits
says?
unknown
speaker
well
how
is
it
relevant
then,
what
was
the
relevance
of
that
evidence
on
the
merits?
unknown
speaker
but
the
testimony
did
include
the
particular
--
i
take
it
officer
biro,
of
course
did
not
testify
on
the
merits.
unknown
speaker
mr.
allen,
do
you
attach
any
significance
to
counsel
statement
in
colloquy,
it
was
trail
judge
at
page
36
a
in
which
he
argued
that
what
the
judge
had
done,
court
will
provide
my
client
with
an
acquittal
on
the
merits,
which
would
not
be
appealable,
which
would
be
as
a
matter
of
double
jeopardy
law
a
final?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
of
course
the
other
side
i
suppose
mr.
allen
is
a
criminal
appeals
act,
provides
if
the
appeal
is
from
the
order
suppressing
the
evidence
that
has
to
before
trail
if
that
were
the
basis
of
appeal.
unknown
speaker
well
i
understand
the
morrison,
but
the
statute
says
an
by
the
united
states,
relied
on
the
court
of
appeals
from
decision
or
order
was
district
court
suppressing
or
excluding
evidence,
not
made
after
the
defendant
has
been
put
in
jeopardy.
but
it
is
not
on
that
theory,
your
theory
is
it
is
an
appeal
from
a
dismissal
of
an
indictment,
that
is
a
statutory
basis
for
the
appeal.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
criminal
appeal
act
does
not
go
to
that
because
it
is
just
an
ordinary
general
rule
quite
apart
from
the
criminal
appeals
act
that
court
of
appeals
has
jurisdiction
to
review
a
judgment
or
an
order,
a
final
order
or
a
decision
something
that
is
decided
and
that
is
identifiable
and
that
is
the
problem
here
but
i
think
we
pretty
well
exhausted
the
subject.
unknown
speaker
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
that
miss
hennessey
had
told
the
officers
about
some
tangible
evidence
or
some
other
evidence
that
they
went
ahead
and
found
and
then
introduced
but
never
offered
her
testimony?
unknown
speaker
you
would
not
why?
unknown
speaker
miss
hennessey
voluntary
told
them
about
the
evidence,
the
real
question
is
whether
they
are
permitted
to
use
in
any
way
the
witness
whose
identity
they
have
learned
from
an
illegal
search.
unknown
speaker
well
it
just
as
attenuated
if
instead
of
miss
hennessey
testifying
she
voluntarily
tells
them
about
some
physical
evidence?
unknown
speaker
including
statements
during
interrogation.
unknown
speaker
on
this
argument,
your
argument
would
be
the
same
if
he
had
been
indicted
for
the
substantive
offense
of
gambling
and
not
purgery.
unknown
speaker
the
record
does
not
tell
us
whether
he
was
indicted
for
gambling,
was
he?
unknown
speaker
those
are
too
quite
independent
and
almost
unrelated.
unknown
speaker
mr.
greenspan
are
you
in
any
position
to
raise
that
question
not
having
cross
petition
for
certiorari?
unknown
speaker
but
we
have
fairly
carefully
set
our
rules
as
to
when
you
have
to
cross
petition
in
order
to
raise
a
point.
you
conceivably
you
can
raise
a
jurisdictional
point
at
any
time
but
ordinarily
you
can
defend
the
result
you
obtained
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
some
other
ground
without
cross-petitioning
but
here
if
you
were
prevail
the
court
of
appeals
instead
of
affirming
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
would
have
dismissed
the
appeal
which
is
not
the
same
result.
unknown
speaker
then
you
have
to
attack
order
that
i
have
read
your
friend,
before
on
page
21
a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
cert.
the
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
it
is
now
here
by
ordered,
a
judge
and
decreed
that
the
judgment
of
the
said
district
court
be
and
hereby
as
affirmed.
i
did
not
said
it
is
judgment
can
you
go
behind
that?
unknown
speaker
is
that
an
order,
is
that
a
admitted
order
--.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
it
is
a
decision?
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
need
a
judgment
because
1291
provides
for
appeal
from
a
final
decision
not
from
the
judgment.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
do
not
have
to,
the
statutes
says,
decision.
the
section
1291
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
appeal;
this
is
taken
under
the
criminal
appeals
act
is
it
not?
this
had
to
be
dismissal
of
an
indictment.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
a
statutory
language
that
describes
that
second
category
of
verdict.
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
he
should
have
decided
it
during
the
trial
or
before
the
trial?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
would
any
judge
having
read
jenkins
and
wilson
decide
a
suppression
motion
during
the
trial
which
cuts
off
the
government’s
right
to
appeal.
i
would
not
think
he
would
decide
either
before
the
trial
or
after
the
trial
since
the
government
has
the
right
to
appeal
on
those
cases
and
you
have
a
right
to
seek
whether
the
district
court
was
right
on
its
decision.
unknown
speaker
what
rule
did
the
prosecutor
not
follow?
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
the
second
circuit
rule.
unknown
speaker
you
referred
that,
that
is
a
time
honor
rule,
is
that
a
rule
of
the
united
states
attorneys
office
or
rule
of
the
court
of
appeals
or
what?
unknown
speaker
why
did
not
the
court
of
appeals
go
off
on
that
ground
here?
unknown
speaker
you
did
not
argue
it.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
you
have
the
privilege
of
arguing
it
here
then?
unknown
speaker
now,
there
was
a
couple
of
errors
that
my
brother,
the
solicitor
general
made
to
this
court
and
i
would
like
to
point
them
out
first
of
all,
officer
biro
did
testify.
unknown
speaker
and
did
not
the
judge
say
he
was
not
considering
his
testimony
on
the
merits?
unknown
speaker
mr.
greenspan
you
started
out
on
the
merits
by
suggesting
that
the
only
test
should
be
an
intervening
cause
kind
of
test
and
in
this
case
the
trial
judge
said
that
it
was
not
only
possible
but
even
probable
that
the
fbi
would
have
interviewed
mrs.
hennessey
later
in
the
course
of
the
gambling
investigation
in
any
event.
would
not
probability
that
the
evidence
would
have
been
disclosed
any
way
be
a
sufficient
intervening
cause,
should
not
be?
unknown
speaker
but
if
it
is
not
done
in
terms
of
degrees
of
probability
how
would
you
phrase
the
intervening
cause,
i
mean
you
suggest
intervening
cause
should
be
the
test
and
i
am
just
wondering
if
that
is
really
any
different
in
the
kind
of
sort
of
probability
test.
unknown
speaker
section
3731
of
title
18.
unknown
speaker
your
point
being
that
if
the
congress
had
intended
only
pretrial
motions
prior
to
jeopardy
to
be
appealable
they
would
not
have
gone
ahead
and
added
the
phrase
and
before
the
verdict
or
finding
of
an
indictment.
unknown
speaker
well,
just
so
i
am
perfectly
clear
on
the
government
theory,
the
theory
then
is
that
if
the
appeal
is
taken
pursuant
to
the
second
paragraph
of
the
3731
rather
than
first
paragraph.
it
is
the
paragraph
in
which
suppression
motions
are
discussed
rather
than
dismissal
and
indictment.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
you
could
but
then
this
language
you
read
to
me
would
not
be
relevant
under
that
theory.
unknown
speaker
need
to
rely
on
that.
