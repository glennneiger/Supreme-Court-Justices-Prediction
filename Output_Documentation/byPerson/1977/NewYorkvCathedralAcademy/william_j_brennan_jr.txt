justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yeah
i
know,
but
i
thought
we
held
in
those
cases
that
if
it
is
a
question
to
whom
this
property
belong
and
to
decide
that
you
got
to
decide
a
question
of
religion
and
courts
have
to
stay
out
of
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
serbian
case
involved
more
than
just
property
that
involved
who
was
the
bishop
and
whether
or
not
a
determination
whether
one
or
the
other
was
the
bishop,
was
anything
that
lay
courts
could
get
into
i
thought
we
can
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
claim
to
property.
the
school
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
property
i
suppose.
