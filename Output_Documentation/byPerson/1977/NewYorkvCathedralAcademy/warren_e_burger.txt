chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
number
76-616
new
york
against
cathedral
academy.
mrs.
coon,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
mrs.
coon
in
lemon
v.
kurtzman
i
have
thought
that
the
entanglement
concept
was
regarded
by
the
court
as
very
dubious
and
was
contributed
to
unconstitutionality
because
it
was
a
continuing
relationship,
the
continuing
entanglement
so
that
it
is
not
the
matter
of
being
a
little
unconstitutional,
or
wholly
unconstitutional
when
you
have
one
audit
as
against
continuing
audit
over
a
long
period
of
time.
it
is
a
question
of
whether
one
audit
creates
entanglement,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
it
is
just
to
finish
recruitment
for
the
particular
fiscal
or
bunch
at
year,
then
it
is
not
is
it
continuing,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
go
back
to
my
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
assuming
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
were
depending
on
getting
it
until
the
end
of
that
school
year.
were
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
for
budget
purposes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
but
that
excessive
entanglement
stopped
with
our
just
holding,
did
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
there
would
be
no
future
in
new
york,
there
will
be
no
future
continuing
entanglement?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
thank
you,
mrs.
coon.
mr.
nolan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wasn't
the
serbian
orthodox
case
based
on
a
whole
line
of
cases
of
this
court
that
we,
the
courts
have
kept
out
of
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
intra
paroles
of
churches
leaving
that
to
the
law
of
the
church.
serbian
orthodox
did
not
involve
any
conflict
between
the
church
and
the
state?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
happen
to
know
what
lemon
and
kurtzman
was
even
cited
in
--?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
so.
we
are
getting
back
if
i
may
to
the
entanglement
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further.
mrs.
coon.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
