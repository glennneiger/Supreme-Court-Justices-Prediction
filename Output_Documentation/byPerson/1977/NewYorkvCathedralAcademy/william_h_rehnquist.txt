isn't
that
a
rather
strange
posture
for
the
attorney
general
to
be
taking
both
in
the
new
york
courts
and
here
to
be
saying
that
law
enacted
by
the
new
york
legislature
is
unconstitutional?
yet
usually
its
my
understanding,
the
attorney
general's
job
is
to
defend
laws
enacted
by
the
legislature?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
why
is
it
different
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
then
in
lemon
it
was
a
recurring
audit,
was
it
not
and
here
i
take
it
just
be
a
one
shot
deal?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
now
that
is
not
a
very
satisfactory
answer,
i
mean,
all
sorts
of
questions
up
here,
turn
on
matters
of
decree
and
distinctions
of
the
audit,
don't
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
exact
effect
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decision,
i
gather
from
your
response
to
justice
steven's
questions
on
the
constitutional
issue,
is
not
going
to
be
clear
until
the
court
of
claims
interprets
that
and
decides
whether
so
much
will
go
or
the
whole
thing
will
go?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
nolan,
when
did
our
decision
in
levitt
come
down?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
money
is
paid
over
what
period
of
time
are
to
be
reimbursed
under
the
act
here
in
question?
