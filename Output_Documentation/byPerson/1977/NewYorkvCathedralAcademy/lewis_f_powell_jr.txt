justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
statement
that
the
statute
always
was
under
attack,
my
recollection
is
a
suit
was
brought
a
day
before
the
statute
became
effective,
said
july
01,
and
no
action
was
taken,
no
request
was
made
for
preliminary
injunction
until
april
11,
nearly
two
years
later?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
not
even
a
request
for
preliminary
stand,
was
it?

powell,

mr.
nolan,
these
are
a
couple
of
decisions
for
last
several
years,
i
know
this
is
not
cited
in
either
a
brief
and
perhaps
are
not
relevant.
in
blue
hull
i
think
it
was
in
the
name
of
one
and
serbian
something,
he
name
of
the
other
in
which
in
effect
we
held
i
think
that
it
is
no
business
of
courts
to
be
deciding
what
is
religion
and
what
is
not,
do
those
cases
have
any
relevance
here?
