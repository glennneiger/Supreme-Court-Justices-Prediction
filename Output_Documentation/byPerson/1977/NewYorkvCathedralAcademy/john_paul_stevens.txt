justice
john
paul
stevens
mrs.
coons,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
what
is
going
to
happen
if
the
goes
back?
on
this
$45
per-pupil,
i
guess
at
least
in
the
higher
grades,
exactly
what
is
to
be
determined?
supposing
they
find
out
that,
that
amount
of
money
was
actually
spent,
but
$5
of
it
could
be
said
to
have
been
contributed
to
some
religious
purpose.
would
they
get
$40
or
nothing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
they
found
that
they
did
not
actually
spend
$45
on
the
test,
they
only
spent
$40,
but
there
was
none
of
that
r
for
religious
purposes
would
they
get
the
$45
then
or
just
$40?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
that
is
true
then
there
is
going
to
be
some
excess,
would
you
argue
that
that
excess
necessarily
contributed
to
the
religious
mission?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
record
now
tell
us
exactly
what
they
are
going
to
ask
for?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
filed
for
the
$45
per-pupil
theory?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
the
purpose
of
the
audit
is
well,
tell
me,
,
i
am
still
concerned
about
the
finality
questions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
nolan,
write
at
that
point,
because
i
want
to
be
sure
you
cleared
for
me
the
the
reliance
issue.
is
it
not
correct
that
the
services
and
the
testing
and
all
that
for
which
the
schools
are
seeking
reimbursement
were
required
by
state
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
would
they
had
not
had
to
perform
this
service
entirely
apart
from
any
reliance
on
other
funds?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
real
harm
to
the
school
is
not
having
all
these
funds
available
as
replacement
for
funds,
they
will
be
used
for
general
purposes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
is
really
the
same
case
as
if
these
funds
were
just
the
general
subsidy
to
that
extent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
the
whole
concept
of
reliance
here
is
really
inability
to
free
up
funds
for
general
purposes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
nolan,
is
it
possible
that
in
that
inquiry
there
may
be
exams
that
follow
a
pattern
that
have
been
used
over
the
years
or
may
be
used
in
the
future?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
there
might
be
a
legitimate
difference
of
opinion
as
to
whether
a
particular
exam
propagates
religion
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
not
possible
that
that
is
also
a
federal
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
you
agree
that
there
is
a
legitimate
room
for
difference
of
opinion
as
to
whether
a
particular
test
has
religious
propagation
features,
they
have
a
large
number
of
claims,
is
it
not
possible
that
the
trier
of
fact
must
make
a
large
number
of
determinations
of
the
religious
versus
lay
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
by
a
large
number
of
schools
there
may
not
necessarily
be
the
same
exam?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
do
not
think,
this
would
be
a
excessive
entanglement
to
be
reviewing
literally
dozens
of
exams
to
see
how
many
have
religious
overtone.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
the
state
education
department
have
to
review
all
these
exams
and
decide
what
position
to
take
with
respect
to
each
in
the
litigation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
some
may
claim
involved
religion,
others
they
would
decide
are
not
sufficiently
serious
that
they
have
to
check
out?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
your
view
mr.
nolan
if
in
conducting
the
audit
it
is
determined
that
only
$40
per-pupil
was
in
fact
spent
by
a
school.
does
the
school
get
$45
or
just
$40?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
statute
contemplates
kind
of
an
actual
reimbursement
rather
than
the
per-pupil?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
how
does
that
answer
the
reliance
question
if
the
school
relied
on
a
full
$45
and
they
only
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
instead
of
they
did
not
spend
the
$45
they
only
spend
$40
and
$5
of
it
was
religious
orientated
exam
do
they
only
get
35
or
they
get
nothing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
get
$35.
