ms.
jean
m.
coon
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
appeal,
there
is
presented
to
this
court
at
least
a
collateral
if
not
a
direct
descendant
of
this
court's
decision
in
levitt
v.
committee
for
public
education
&
religious
liberty
decided
in
1973.
in
that
case,
this
court
held
invalid
under
the
first
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
a
new
york
statute
enacted
in
1970
which
had
provided
reimbursement
to
non
public
schools
for
the
costs
of
certain
state
mandated
record
keeping
and
testing
services
and
so
doing
this
court
affirmed
a
decision
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
which
had
invalidated
the
statute
primarily
on
the
basis
that
the
tests
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
the
federal
district
court,
the
district
court
was
1972.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
it
was
1973.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes,
it
was.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
it
was
during
the
school
year
and
it
was
--
the
statute
provided
for
annual
payments
in
two
installments,
one
of
which
had
been
made
for
1971-72
school
year
and
the
other
one
had
yet
to
be
made
and
in
fact
a
preliminary
injunction
was
issued
by
the
district
court,
i
believe
about
two
days
prior
to
the
earliest
date
on
which
that
second
payment
could
have
been
made.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes
your
honor.
it
provided
--
the
statute
provided
for
a
lump
sum
per-pupil
payment.
the
record
before
this
court
at
that
time
indicated
that
the
amounts
which
were
paid
to
the
schools
were
in
fact
generally
less
than
the
actual
cost
of
rendering
of
services
involved.
immediately,
succeeding
the
decision
of
the
district
court,
which
had
enjoined
permanently,
the
payment
of
the
state
a
which
was
provided
by
the
statute
and
which
of
course
have
the
effect
of
permanently
preventing,
the
second
payment
for
the
1971-72
school
year.
the
new
york
state
legislature
enacted
the
statute
here
in
question
which
by
its
terms
enabled
the
non
public
schools
to
go
into
the
new
york
state
court
of
claims
and
to
sue
in
the
court
of
claims
to
collect
that
second
payment
for
the
71-72
school
year.
at
that
time,
this
case
which
is
before
this
court
today
was
selected
as
a
test
case
to
be
tried
in
advance
and
determined
in
advance
of
any
other
cases
under
the
statute.
the
state
moved
to
dismiss
the
claim
in
the
court
of
claims
on
the
basis
that
the
statute
was
merely
a
resurrection
of
the
statute
which
this
court
had
declared
to
be
unconstitutional
in
1973.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
as
a
normal
state
of
affairs
that
is
true.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
it
is
different
here
because
it
is,
well,
for
one
thing
we
felt
that
as
a
matter
of
policy
that
this
court
is
having
come
down
with
the
decision
holding
the
underlying
statute,
the
1970
statute
unconstitutional.
that
we
had
an
obligation
to
uphold
the
decision
of
this
court,
but
additionally
it
is
as
a
matter
of
practice
in
defending
the
state
in
what,
in
the
court
of
claims,
under
these
enabling
acts,
and
these
are
relatively
common
practice
by
the
new
york
state
legislature
to
pass
acts
enabling
certain
claimants
who
for
one
reason
or
another
were
unable
to
bring
an
action
originally
under
the
court
of
claims
act.
it
is
a
practice
of
our
office
to
defend
in
many
instances
by
contesting
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
itself.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
that
is
quite
true,
your
honor,
and
i
think
in
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
that
is
quite
true,
your
honor
and
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
and
one
of
basic
arguments
that
we
frequently
make
and
which
was
one
of
the
arguments
made
in
this
case
itself
as
a
state
constitutional
argument
is
that
many
cases
we
challenge
the
statutes
on
the
basis
that
they
constitute
unconstitutional
gift
to
state
funds.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no,
in
all
those
cases
when
they
are
dealing
with
the
state
constitutional
questions.
in
this
case
we
were
dealing
with
a
federal
constitutional
question
and
that
was
the
basis
upon
which
the
court
of
claims
and
the
state
courts
all
decide,
that
was
on
the
basis
federal
constitutional
question.
the
state
court
of
claims
held
--
agreed
with
the
state's
position,
granted
the
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
basis
that
the
statute
was
indeed
a
reenactment
even
if
only
for
one
payment,
the
statute
held
unconstitutional
by
this
court
in
1973,
and
in
so
doing
the
court
distinguished
this
court's
decision
in
the
second
lemon
case.
lemon
v.
kurtzman,
which
permitted
the
final
payment
under
the
pennsylvania
statute
which
had
been
declared
unconstitutional
in
the
first
lemon
case.
this
case
however,
in
the
posture
which
is
presented
to
this
court
has
one
additional
issue
which
arises
out
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals'
decision
and
i
believe
it
is
that
decision
which
brings
really
the
first
argument
which
must
be
presented
to
this
court
because
in
scheduling
argument
in
this
case,
the
court
delayed
the
decision
on
jurisdiction,
pending
the
oral
argument
and
we
have
recognized
that
what
we
are
appealing
from
here
is
technically
an
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
did
remand
this
case
to
the
court
of
claims
for
an
actual
trial
on
the
amount
of
damages.
we
submitted
to
this
court,
and
in
fact
the
appellees
here
agree
that
the
decision
of
this
court,
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision
was
final
for
the
purposes
of
jurisdiction
in
this
court
because
it
did
finally
determine
the
question
of
constitutionality
under
the
federal
constitution
of
the
1972
enabling
act.
but
additionally
we
submit
to
the
court
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
decision,
interjected
a
new
element
which
we
consider
to
be
a
new
element
of
unconstitutionality
into
this
decision.
the
court
of
appeals
in
remanding
to
the
court
of
claims,
adopted
the
minority
decision
in
the
state
appellate
division,
and
in
that
decision
the
opinion
in
that,
over
the
minority
in
that
court,
said
that
the
issue
of
how
the
funds
were
actually
used
by
the
schools,
and
whether
or
not
they
were
used
for
--
further
the
religious
purpose
of
the
schools,
could
and
should
be
tried
in
each
claim
in
the
court
of
claims.
now,
we
should
note
that
under
the
new
york
state
constitution,
the
power
to
audit
and
determine
claims
against
the
state
of
new
york
is
given
to
the
court
of
claims.
consequently
we
feel
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
interjected
into
this
statute
an
element
which
was
not
present
when
the
underlying
1970
statutes
before
this
court
and
that
is
a
question
of
excessive
entanglement
between
church
and
state
because
the
auditing
function
which
would
be
performed
by
the
court
of
claims
in
the
trial
of
these
cases,
is
significantly
similar
to
the
auditing
requirement
which
this
court
found
to
be
unconstitutional
in
the
first
lemon
decision.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
it
was
a
recurring
audit
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
the
distinction,
it
raises
a
question
of
whether
or
not
something
can
be
a
little
bit
unconstitutional,
it
was
the
audit
for
the
function.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
it
may
be
your
honor,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
in
this
type
of
a
situation
that
if
the
new
york
state
legislature
were
to
be
able
to
enact
a
statute
similar
to
this
then
this
could
be
done
anytime
a
statute
is
found
to
be
on
--
similar
statute
to
be
found
unconstitutional.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes,it
is
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
here
we
have
a
situation
where
the
entanglement
if
any
exists,
it
exists
for
the
entire
duration
of
the
statute
and
that
may
be
the
analogy
there
that
this
is
the
statute.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no,
your
honor,
but
the
original
statute,
the
1970
statute
simply
provided
a
lump
sum
per-pupil
payment.
at
the
time
of
this
statute
which
is
before
the
court
now
was
enacted,
it
was
the
understanding,
i
believe
of
all
the
parties
that
including
the
legislature,
that
what
the
legislature
was
doing,
was
providing
for
the
court
of
claims
to
make
an
award
which
would
be
a
mathematical
computation
of
the
same
lump
sum
amount.
but
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
done
in
this
case,
is
to
provide
for
an
audit
by
the
court
of
claims,
an
audit
which
will
go
into
the
question
of
how
all
of
this
money
was
used
in
the
school
year
to
go
into
the
question
really
of
an
analysis
of
the
tests,
which
were
given
by
the
teachers
involved
here
and
to
determine
whether
or
not
these
services
because
what
would
be
involved
here
is
the
compensation
for
the
teacher-prepared
test,
whether
or
not
these
tests,
further
the
religious
function
of
the
schools
and
we
would
submit
to
the
court
that,
that
type
of
a
situation
even
on
a
one
shot
deal
would
create
an
excessive
entanglement
situation
between
the
courts
of
new
york
state
and
the
non
public
schools.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
would
assume
that
the
under
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
they
would
get
the
$40
with
the
court
of
appeals'
decision.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
they
would
get
$45
under
the
statute.
it
is
for
testing
and
record
keeping
purposes
and
the
record
before
this
court
under
the
1973
was
that
the
lump
sum
per-pupil
allotment
actually
came
out
to
less
than
the
actual
cost
performing
all
other
services.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well,
the
excess
would
be,
it
may
be
your
honor
that,
on
going
back
and
trying
this.
this
case
could
be
tried
in
a
posture
in
which
big
schools
could
put
in
their
claims
for
the
clearly
constitutional,
what
we
would
consider
to
be
the
fairly
constitutional
aspects
that
is
the
direct
attendance,
medical
record
keeping,
the
administration
of
the
state-mandated
test.
the
state
regions
and
various
other
state-prepared
and
mandated
test
and
that
in
fact,
none
of
the
amount,
the
per-pupil
amount
might
necessarily
relate
to
the
teacher-prepared
tests
at
all.
in
other
words,
the
schools,
if
they
put
in
their
claim
for
their
cost,
could
actually
--
might
in
some
cases
come
up
with
cost
which
would
be
acknowledged
to
be
constitutional
expenditures
without
reaching
the
question
of
the
teacher-prepared
test
and
others
they
would
not,
and
that
there
would
be
when
you
get
into
this
question
of
the
teacher-prepared
test,
they
reach
the
question
of
the
cost
of
teacher-prepared
test
that
you
would
run
into
this
question
of
entanglement.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no,
your
honor
because
the
claims
were
filed
based
on
the
mathematical
computation.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
$45
per-pupil,
$27
per-pupil
on
elementary
grades.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
the
question,
the
finality
,
t
seems
to
us
arises
in
basic
way,
in
the
fact
that
the
state
court
of
appeals
decision
finally
determined
the
question
of
constitutionality
of
this
statute
under
the
federal
constitution.
there
is
nothing
that
in
going
back
into
the
court
of
claims.
there
is
nothing
that
the
court
of
claims
in
a
further
decision
in
this
case
or
in
any
of
the
state
appellate
courts
in
a
further
decision
of
this
case
could
say
which
would
affect
the
court
of
appeals
decision
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
underlying
enabling
act.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
that
would
be,
i
think
it
seems
to
me
your
honor
is
a
part
of
the
mathematical
computation.
if
this
court
were
to
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
saying
you
go
back
and
try
these
issues
and
if
this
does
not
constitute,
as
we
feel
it
does
in
excessive
entanglement,
then
it
is
simply
a
question
of
applying,
of
trying
the
issue
of
what
each
school
was
doing
with
this
money?
it
does
not
affect
the
underlying
question
of
whether
or
not
the
state
could
constitutionally
in
effect
resurrect
1970
statute
by
an
enabling
act.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well,
i
think
that
the
position
of
the
appellees
here
is
better
in
effect
because
of
the
fact
that
the
invalidation
came
during
the
school
year.
i
would
submit
that
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
come
after
and
i
would
submit
to
your
honor
that
actually
it
seems
to
me
that
it
does
not
make
any
difference.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well,
having
come
during
a
school
year,
they
can
raise
the
argument
that
the
school
budget
for
example,
was
prepared
based
upon
the
expectation
of
receipt
of
these
funds,
if
it
came
as
after
the
close
of
the
school
year
and
in
prior
to
the
commencement
of
the
next
school
year,
you
would
not
have
that
argument.
we
submit
to
the
court
that
that
is
one
of
the
basic
differences
really
between
this
case
and
the
second
lemon
case.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well,
may
be
if
i
try
to
distinguish
the
second
lemon
case,
i
can
show
you
why
i
am
saying
this.
when
the
first,
when
lemon
i
came
to
this
court,
it
came
as
an
appeal
from
a
decision
of
the
pennsylvania
district
court,
holding
constitutional.
the
pennsylvania
statute
which
provided
for
the
purchase
of
secular
educational
services
from
the
non
public
schools.
one
of
the
basic
arguments
in
support
of
enabling
the
schools
in
pennsylvania
to
collect
their
final
payment,
the
final
year's
payment
under
the
pennsylvania
statute,
was
that
the
schools
had
in
fact
budgeted
their
funds
in
reliance
upon
the
receipt
of
a
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well,
they
presumably
budgeted
their
school
expenses
for
the
entire
year,
in
reliance
on
the
fact
that
they
would
be
collecting
this
money.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes,
they
were.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
they
were
depending
on
getting
both
payments
and
these
payments
are
not
made
semi
annually,
there
was,
one
is
made
in
january
and
one
in
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well,
because
the
school
they
have
budgeted
their
expenses
for
the
whole
school
year.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes,
that
is
what
the
problem
is?
the
budget
has
been
thrown
out
of
line
and
this
is
why
i
say
that
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no,
this
is
why
i
say
that
the
appellees'
position
here,
i
feel
is
stronger
with
this
having
been
invalidated
during
the
school
year
than
if
it
were
after
the
close,
but
we
would
say
to
the
court,
that
in
this
case,
that
does
it
really
follow
because
this
statute,
the
1970
statute
was
under
attack
from
the
time
it
became
effective
that
unlike
the
pennsylvania
statute
where
they
had
a
district
court
decision
prior
to
it
reaching
this
court,
but
they
had
a
district
court
decision
saying
the
statute
was
unconstitutional.
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute
was
always
at
issue
and
was
always
in
a
situation
in
which
the
schools
could
not
really
rely
upon
the
continued
implementation
of
the
statute,
that
at
any
time,
a
preliminary
injunction
could
be
requested
that
at
any
time
a
district
court
decision
could
have
held
it
unconstitutional.
the
fact
that
they
collected
state
aid
under
the
statute
for
a
year-and-a-half
is
not
something
upon
which
they
could
rely,
because
the
statute
always
was
under
attack
from
the
time
it
became
effective,
and
there
was
always
that
element
of
uncertainty.
we
would
say
to
the
court
that
there
was
in
pennsylvania
statute
situation,
an
element
if
not
of
certainty,
an
element
at
least
of
some
reassurance,
and
the
fact
that
the
district
court
had
held
the
statute
constitutional.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
that's
quite
true,
your
honor.
the
statute,
the
action
was
commenced
the
day
before
the
statute
became
effective,
but
as
i
said
the
action
was
commenced,
it
is
not
a
situation
in
which
the
statute
was
allowed
to
go
into
effect
and
continue
in
effect
for
a
year
or
so,
before
it
was
started.
the
case
was
started
and
it
was
under
--
there
were
movements
of
put
on
in
terms
of
interrogatories
that
were
submitted,
and
so
forth
that
the
case
was
underway
of
the
entire
time
of
the
statute
was
in
effect
and
we
say
that
this
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no,
your
honor
it
was
not.
this
we
think
is
one
other
reasons
why
we
feel
there
is
a
distinction
between
this
court's
decision
in
the
lemon
case
and
in
this,
and
the
other
one
really
is
that
the
--
in
the
lemon
situation
what
was
held
unconstitutional
there
was
not
the
services,
not
the
payment
for
the
services
that
were
being,
were
compensated
for
by
the
non
public
to
the
non
public
schools,
but
the
fact
that
there
was
this
excessive
and
continuing
auditing
process
which
the
court
considered
to
be
an
excessive
entanglement.
in
lemon
ii,
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes,
it
did
your
honor,
that
is
why
i
am
saying,
i
am
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no,
that
is
true
your
honor,
but
i
think
i
am
getting
beyond
the
question
of
finality.
now,
what
i
am
trying
to
do
is
distinguish
the
two
statutes,
the
type
of
payment.
this
court
in
lemon
ii
said
that
in
effect
that
the
payment,
--
final
payment
to
the
non
public
schools
in
pennsylvania
would
be
permitted
in
part,
because
the
unconstitutional
aspect
of
that
statute
had
already
occurred.
in
other
words,
the
audit
had
already
occurred.
it
was
just
then
the
question
of
paying
out
the
amount
in
question
and
that
there
was
in
the
making
that
final
payment,
there
would
be
no
unconstitutional
feature
involved.
on
the
contrary
in
this
case,
we
have
a
situation
where
what
was
held
unconstitutional
by
this
court,
was
not
an
auditing
function
or
continuing
function,
but
the
fact
that
among
the
tests
that
would
be
compensated
for,
under
the
act
were
those
which
were
teacher-prepared
and
which
this
court
held
to
be
an
integral
part
of
the
teaching
process
of
the
non
public
schools
and
that
it
was
the
compensation
for
those
teacher-prepared
tests,
which
the
court
found
to
be
unconstitutional
and
we
submit
to
the
court
that
in
this
enabling
act
what
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
new
york
has
done,
has
been
to
say
to
these
schools,
you
may
collect
even
if
only
for
this
one
final
payment,
compensation
for
services
which
the
united
states
supreme
court
has
held
to
be
unconstitutional
in
terms
of
compensation
by
the
state,
and
we
submit
to
the
court
that
this
is
really,
we
submit
a
significant
distinguishing
feature
between
the
permission
of
the
final
payment
in
lemon
ii,
and
in
the
pennsylvania
statute,
and
the
provision
for
payment
here,
and
we
submit
to
the
court
that
this
makes,
this
payment
here
unconstitutional
and
under
the
federal
constitution
and
that
constitutes
a
resurrection
even
if
only
for
one
time
of
the
statute
which
this
court
held
unconstitutional
in
1973.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no.
