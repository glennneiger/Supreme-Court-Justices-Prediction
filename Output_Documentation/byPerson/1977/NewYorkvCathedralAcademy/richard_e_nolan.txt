mr.
richard
e.
nolan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
richard
nolan.
i
represent
cathedral
academy.
the
issue
here
is
whether
this
case
is
controlled
by
the
rationale
of
this
court's
decision
in
lemon
ii,
where
the
court
balanced
in
a
very
flexible
way
and
a
very
equitable
way,
constitutional
matters
as
opposed
to
reliance
interests.
in
this
case,
the
courts
below,
i
am
referring
to
the
court
of
claims,
i
am
referring
to
both
the
majority
and
dissenting
opinions
in
the
appellate
division
as
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
these
schools
had
relied
in
terms
of
planning
their
budgets
which
had
to
be
done
before
the
school
year
begins,
on
the
way
so
that
cathedral
academy
would
expect
to
receive
probably
about
$14,000
per
year
in
two
annual
installments,
and
they
would
act
on
the
basis
of
their
expectation
in
receipt
of
that
money.
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
i
believe
that
so,
i
know
this
helped
there.
schools
have
to
maintain
attendance
records,
they
have
to
maintain
health
records,
they
have
to
provide
--
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
they
would
have
had
to
perform
the
services,
but
they
would
not
have
expected
any
reimbursement,
but
the
statute
mandated
services
act
did,
was
to
give
that
at
the
schools
an
expectation
of
reimbursement
of
certain
moneys
which
they
could
use
for
their
general
purposes.
it
is
quite
true
that
services
though
--
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
well,
i
think
the
funds
that
would
have
been
made
available
really
would
have
gone
into
the
general
purposes
of
the
school,
would
be
an
additional
money.
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
well,
i
think
that
was
raised
in
the
levitt
case,
but
i
think
as
to
that,
this
court
has
never
said
that
simply
because
a
payment
is
made
to
a
school
which
enables
it
to
free
up
all
the
funds,
but
that
is
a
violation
of
the
establishment
clause.
this
argument
was
made
by
the
state
in
its
brief
and
i
think
we
have
answered
it
on
that
basis
with
referring
to
that
robert(ph)case.
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
that
is
right
your
honor.
in
the
mandated
services
act
case,
the
levitt
case,
i
think
the
chronology
is
fairly
significant
because
the
statute
was
attacked
almost
immediately,
like
i
think
the
lawsuits
filed
either
contemporaneously
with
the
statute,
or
very
shortly
thereafter?
nothing
was
done
in
that
case
by
the
plaintiffs,
except
to
move
for
the
convening
of
the
three
judge
district
court,
that
motion
was
opposed
by
the
state,
opposed
by
the
intervenors,
but
was
granted
by
the
district
court,
that
meant
that
in
the
district
court's
judgment,
there
was
a
substantial
federal
constitutional
question
which
required
the
convening
of
a
three
judge
district
court
under
the
statutes
then
in
effect.
then,
the
case
remain
acquired
for
at
least
another
year
until
1972
and
i
think
the
reason
for
that
was
because
this
court
had
before
the
lemon
i
case,
and
the
tilton
case
and
putting
aside
the
general
question
as
to
the
precision
with
which
people
can
predict
the
outcome
of
first
amendment
church-state
cases.
there
was
a
great
deal
of
question
in
everybody's
mind
as
to
what
effect
the
lemon
and
tilton
cases
would
have
on
the
mandated
services
act.
it
was
not
until
1972,
in
march
of
1972,
that
the
three
judge
court
called
for
briefs.
by
that
time
--
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
there
was
never
an
application
for
a
preliminary
injunction
or
a
temporary
restraining
order
your
honor.
the
case
simply
remained
at
rest.
i
believe
there
came
a
point
where
the
plaintiffs
wrote
to
chief
judge
kaufman
and
asked
him
to
expedite
the
matter
chief
judge
kaufman
pointed
the
three
judge
court
in
march,
they
called
for
briefs,
the
case
was
argued
in
early
april.
it
was
argued
about
three
or
four
days
before
the
first
payments
for
the
second
semester
would
have
been
made
between
the
period
of
april
15
and
june
15.
the
court
heard
argument
and
entered
a
temporary
restraining
order
until
its
decision
which
came
down
in
the
later
part
of
april.
that
decision
was
not
unanimous,
it
was
a
very
very
vigorous
dissent
by
judge
palmieri.
then
the
case
came
up
here,
but
in
the
meantime
and
before
lemon
ii
had
been
decided,
the
new
york
legislature
recognizing
the
problems
which
the
district
court's
decision,
or
the
timing
of
the
district
court's
decision
had
coursed
to
these
schools,
passed
chapter
996.
now,
the
case
came
up
here
and
this
court
well
knows,
the
court
took
probable
jurisdiction.
obviously
there
had
to
be
something
to
argue
about,
the
case
was
then
fully
argued
and
briefed
and
it
was
decided
that
the
mandated
services
act
was
unconstitutional
with
one
justice
dissenting,
mr.
justice
white.
so
i
think
to
say
as
ms.
coon
now
does
that
the
schools
could
not
have
reasonably
relied
on
receipt
of
this
money,
at
least
up
until
the
time
of
a
final
determination
as
to
constitutionality,
i
must
say,
i
do
not
think
that
is
correct
and
certainly
does
not
comport
with
this
court's
decision
in
lemon
ii
which
recognized
the
very
very
shadowing
line
of
demarcation
between
what
is
valid
and
what
is
invalid
in
the
church-state
cases
and
which
also
recognized
the
fact
that
there
is
a
a
presumption
of
constitutionality
under
which
state
officials,
private
parties
are
entitled
to
act,
and
entitled
to
rely.
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
the
decision
came
down
in
june
1973.
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
money
which
would
have
been
paid
for
the
second
half
of
the
1971-72
school
year.
in
other
words,
those
would
have
been
paid
had
the
district
court's
decision
not
come
down
when
it
did,
those
moneys
would
have
been
paid
between
april
15
and
june
15
of
1972.
the
district
court's
temporary
restraining
order
followed
by
its
2:1
decision
in
late
of
april
1972,
blocked
the
payment
of
those
funds
and
it
is
those
funds
that
chapter
996
is
intended
to
address
its
altitude.
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
the
aggregate
of
the
sum
i
believe
state
has
--
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
the
aggregate
of
this
particular
claim
is
$7,300.
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
that
would
represent
one
half
of
the
reimbursement
which
cathedral
academy
could
have
expected.
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
yes,
it
is
your
honor.
the
state
and
we
have
considered
to
be
as
test
case
--
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
996,
i
think
would
involve
a
total
amount
of
claims
filed
in
the
court
of
claims
and
about
$11
million
by
i
believe
2000
schools.
so
that
we
are
talking
about
not
$14
million,
but
something
reasonably
close
to
it.
now,
one
of
the
attempt
to
distinctions
that
the
state
makes
respect
to
lemon,
is
that
in
lemon
there
was
an
audit
procedure
under
the
statute
which
audit
procedure
had
been
completed
except
the
certain
administrative
details
by
the
time,
the
case
was
concluded.
in
this
case
the
statute,
the
mandated
services
act
did
not
have
an
audit
procedure,
and
that
was
one
of
the
problems
that
we
had
with
it,
it
provided
for
a
lump
sum
payment
and
that
is
what
one
of
the
things
this
court
found
to
be
defective.
in
chapter
996,
what
the
legislature
has
attempted
to
do,
is
to
give
to
the
court
of
claims,
jurisdiction
to
hear
claims
against
the
state
for
reimbursement
of
mandated
services.
the
state
claims
that
this
is
going
to
create
an
entanglement.
first
of
all,
it
is
a
one
time
reimbursement
and
it
cannot
occur
again.
the
statute
on
its
face
applies
only
to
whatever
portion
of
the
second
half
of
the
1971-72
funds
are
found
by
the
court
of
claims
to
be
reimbursable.
secondly,
we
do
not
have
here
a
situation
such
as
in
the
ordinary
entanglement
situation,
of
the
administrative
officers
of
the
state
government
in
new
york's
case
the
state
education
department,
coming
into
the
schools
and
in
effect,
telling
the
schools
what
to
do
or
interfering
with
the
school's
operations
whatever
they
may
be.
what
we
have
here
is
a
judicial
proceeding
in
the
court
of
claims,
which
handles
all
money
damage
cases
against
the
state
of
new
york.
we
have
a
situation
here
where
a
claimant
just
as
a
construction
claimant
or
anybody
who
is
a
contract
fight
with
the
state
of
new
york,
that
will
come
in
and
will
attempt
to
prove
what
it
was,
that
what
services
he
performed
that
he
is
entitled
to
recover
against
the
state
on,
either
on
a
theory
of
contract,
or
on
a
theory
of
statutory
authorization
or
queries
like
contract
or
one.
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
i
believe
so
your
honor,
if
what
--
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
i
think
that
to
what
--
that
is
yes,
but
i
think
that
that
can
be
handled
under
the
procedures
that
have
been
set
up
as
indicated
in
the
opinion
of
presiding
justice
hurley
here,
the
appellate
division
which
opinion
was
later
adopted
as
a
majority
opinion
by
the
court
of
appeals.
i
think
so
far
as
attendance
records,
health
records,
the
costs
provided
in
the
state
standardized
region's
examination,
pupil
evaluation,
performance
examinations
and
like,
there
should
not
be
any
problem
there.
what
--
where
the
problem
arises
as
mr.
justice
marshall
rightly
points
out,
is
in
making
sure
that
no
reimbursement
will
occur
for
examinations
in
or
examinations
which
tend
to
propagate
religion.
presiding
justice
hurley
stated;
however,
it
is
readily
apparent
that
it
was
never
the
intent
of
the
legislature
that
any
of
its
funds
would
have
been
allowed
for
the
furtherance
of
religious
purposes.
in
this
regard,
the
audit
by
the
court
of
claims
must
serve
the
same
purpose
as
the
final
post
audit
which
was
referred
to
in
lemon
ii.
accordingly,
the
burden
will
be
on
the
claimant
to
prove
that
the
items
of
its
claim
are
in
fact
solely
for
mandated
services,
and
the
burden
will
be
upon
the
court
of
claims
to
make
appropriate
findings
in
regard
thereto.
so
i
think
the
court
of
claims
is
going
to
have
if
claims
are
made
or
reimbursement
of
teacher-prepared
examinations,
we
will
have
to
take
evidence
as
to
what
those
examinations
consisted
other
than
satisfy
itself,
it
can
do
so,
or
the
claimants
can
carry
their
burden
of
proof
that
this
was
not
a
method
of
propagating
religion.
i
think
that
also
--
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
i
think
so.
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
i
would
think
so
your
honor,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
not
only
on
the
merits
of
a
case
but
also
on
the
finality
point,
the
law
of
new
york
state
now,
what
is
this,
what
presiding
justice
hurley
wrote
as
adopted
by
the
appellate
division
--
by
the
court
of
appeals,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
law
of
new
york
is
that
no
money
will
be
reimbursed
for
any
tests
to
propagate
religion,
so
that
as
a
matter
of
the
state
law,
as
a
matter
of
new
york
law
no
payments
can
be
made
for
anything
that
propagates
religion,
and
the
court
of
claims,
or
the
appellate
division
or
the
court
of
appeals,
it
seems
to
me,
is
perfectly
capable
of
making
those
determinations
as
matters
of
state
law,
so
that
we
do
not
have,
i
do
not
think,
we
do
not
have
a
situation
here
where
we
have
a
real
finality
problem.
i
think,
finality
will
come
within
the
first
two
tests
of
the
cox
broadcasting
company
case
and
i
think
that
the
way
the
new
york
courts
have
handled
this
situation,
so
as
to
make
the
question
of
religious
propagations,
or
reimbursement
for
religious
propagation,
matters
of
state
law,
it
means
that
this
court
need
not
worry
about
the
case
coming
back
up.
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
yes,
but
i
think
will
be
decided
as
matters
of
state
law
because
of
the
way
that
presiding
justice
hurley
and
the
court
of
appeals
that
--
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
it
may
very
well
be
although
i
would
think
there
would
be
certain
patterns,
we
are
talking
about
examinations
we
are
given
at
one
particular
semester.
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
i
would
think
in
many
cases
they
would
not
be
the
same
exam
and
there
would
be
a
burden
on
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
i
would
not
think
it
is
anymore
difficult
and
the
problems
of
the
court
of
claims
is
going
through
and
trying
to
sort
out
who
but
gets
paid
for
wanting
himself
more
in
albany,
the
claims
are
on
the
self
moreover
remains
and
require
tremendous
amount
of
time
and
energy
by
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
no,
it
did
not,
but
there
is
no
reason
why
not
--
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
it
could
be
involved
here.
but
i
think
the
court
of
--
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
i
say
it
is.
it
is
involved,
but
it
is
not
excessive
entanglement
because
it
is
a
one
time
process
by
a
court
which
is
capable
of
handling
this
as
a
legal
matter
which
does
not
involve
any
intrusion
by
the
state
educational
department
and
finally
it
deals
with
matters
which
occurred
over
five
years
ago.
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
i
believe
the
attorney
general's
office
would
represent
the
state
in
proceedings
in
the
--
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
i
would
think
what
have
to
be
--
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
i
would
say
$40.
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
the
statute
contemplates
as
i
read
it.
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
this
means
perhaps
the
statute
did
not
quite
meet
the
full
effect
that
its
sponsors
intended
to
meet,
but
the
statute
again
has
not
been
construed
in
that
light
by
the
new
york
courts.
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
they
would
get
whatever
they
were
entitled
to
that
was
not,
did
not
--
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
that
did
not
involve
reimbursement
for
religiously
orientated
examinations.
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
but
i
think,
i
do
not
think
so.
i
think
that
is
in
the
context
of
property
disputes.
property
disputes
as
to
the
operation
of
a
church
i
think
here
what
we
are
talking
about
is
simply
a
matter
of
fact
as
to
what
occurred
five
years
ago
in
the
spring
of
1972.
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
well,
i
think
that
would
involve
questions
as
to
the
organizational
philosophy
of
particular
church
and
how
its
property
was
to
be
divided
up
in
the
case
of
a
--
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
well,
i
think
that
this
situation
is
somewhat
different
because
this
is
in
effect
a
claim
for
services
rendered
and
if
a
church
school
would
have
some
contract
with
--
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
its
a
claim
for
money
that
the
--
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
it
is
property
in
that
sense,
but
following
that
rationality
a
church
or
a
church
school
could
never
seek
to
recover
damages
from
a
state
in
the
court
of
claims
or
any
other
court
because
the
court
would
be
incompetent
to
decide
those
things
--
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
i
am
simply
--
i
do
not
agree
with
it.
i
am
still
understanding
that,
that
would
an
improper
result.
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
well,
i
really.
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
well,
i
do
not
think
its,
it
may
be
entanglement,
but
i
do
not
think
it
is
excessive
entanglement.
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
that
is
right.
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
as
my
understanding
and
that
follow
the
long
line
of
cases
in
this
court
and
i
believe
also
with
new
york
courts
with
respect
to
--
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
i
do
not
believe
it
was.
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
i
really
find
it
very
hard
to
see
how
there
can
be
excessive
entanglement
here,
obviously
there
could
be
entanglement,
but
that
is
not
enough.
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
there
has
to
be
an
unreasonable
or
excessive
entanglement
or
intrusion.
in
this
situation,
there
will
be
determinations
as
to
whether
or
not
these
teacher-prepared
examinations
could
carry
the
propensity
for
the
inculcation
of
religion,
but
we
are
not
talking
about
anything
that
is
going
to
affect
the
relationship
between
the
state
and
the
church
schools
now
or
in
the
future.
we
are
talking
about
accomplished
fact
in
the
spring
of
1972.
what
examinations
were
given
in
history,
to
what
extent
was
religious
matters
covered
by
those,
to
what
extent
were
they
not
and
a
determination
made
as
to
whether
and
to
what
to
extent
money
damages
are
to
be
awarded?
i
do
not
think
that
has
any
propensity
at
all
for
moving
the
state
into
a
position
where
it
would
affecting
the
ongoing
operations
of
the
schools
or
creating
any
sort
of
administrative
interplay
between
the
present
operations
of
the
schools
and
the
state
and
i
think
that
the
entanglement
on
argument
whatever
its
merits
maybe
in
an
ongoing
program
where
moneys
are
to
be
made
available
year
after,
year
after,
year
and
will
have
to
be
audits,
periodical
audits
to
make
sure
as
in
lemon
that
there
would
be
no
use
of
this
money
for
religion,
that's
a
totally
different
thing
i
think
from
the
one
time
limited
reimbursement
that
we
are
talking
about
here.
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
certainly
would
--
mr.
richard
e.
nolan
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
i
think
it
would.
thank
you
very
much
your
honor.
