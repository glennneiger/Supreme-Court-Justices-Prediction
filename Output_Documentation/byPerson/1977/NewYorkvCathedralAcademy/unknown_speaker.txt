unknown
speaker
well,
what
year
was
that?
unknown
speaker
and
ours
was
1973.
unknown
speaker
it
was
april
1972.
was
not
it
in
the
middle
of
school
year
--
unknown
speaker
or
during
the
school
year.
unknown
speaker
and
these
were
really
reimbursements,
were
they
not
or
expense,
really
incurred?
unknown
speaker
you
certainly
know,
we
ask
the
defendant,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
otherwise
a
legislature
could
pass
grossly
unconstitutional,
pay
flagrantly,
patently
unconstitutional
legislation
awarding
money
to
people
they
are
just
coming
to
the
court
of
claims
and
get
it
and
there
would
be
nobody
to
defend
the
--
unknown
speaker
and
the
legislation
is
unconstitutional.
unknown
speaker
that
all
long
fact
that
the
invalidation
at
the
trial
court
level
was
during
the
school
year
rather
than
after?
unknown
speaker
it
is
better
than
if
it
had
come
after
the
school
year?
unknown
speaker
and
we
think
it
is
just
the
other
way
around?
unknown
speaker
but
you
are
not
following
that
all.
unknown
speaker
precisely
and
here
they
do
not
have
when
its
invalidated
during
the
year
that
element
of
reliance
expires,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
how
can
you
say
that
when
it
is
invalidated
in
april?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
budgeted,
but
obviously
the
budget
has
been
thrown
out
of
line?
unknown
speaker
i
am
just
trying
to
build
up
an
argument
for
you
but
you
do
not
want
to
to
accept
it?
unknown
speaker
in
the
meantime
there
was
never
an
application
for
injunctive
--
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
aggregate
of
that
sum
mr.
nolan?
unknown
speaker
only
$14,000
what
is
that
symbolic
of?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
this
is
a
test
case
i
gather
for
all
funds.
unknown
speaker
and
996
was
involved
how
much?
unknown
speaker
what
is
that?
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
agree
with
your
statement.
i
do
not
think
that
church
could
recover
money
and
any
of
these
pupils
did
not
involve
passing
on
religion?
unknown
speaker
justice
brennan
had
suggested
to
you
that
this
has
just
entangled
by
another
name.
