justice
potter
stewart
this
case
is
here
by
way
of
a
direct
appeal
from
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york.
in
april
of
1972,
a
three-judge
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
declared
unconstitutional
new
york's
mandated
services
act,
which
authorized
fixed
payments
to
nonpublic
schools
as
reimbursement
for
the
cost
of
certain
record
keeping
and
testing
services
required
by
state
law.
the
court's
order
permanently
enjoined
any
payments
under
the
act,
including
reimbursement
for
expenses
that
schools
had
already
incurred
in
the
last
half
of
the
1971-1972
school
year.
this
court
subsequently
affirmed
that
judgment
in
a
decision
reported
in
volume
413
of
the
united
states
reports.
two
months
after
the
district
court's
decision,
the
new
york
state
legislature
responded
to
it
by
enacting
a
law,
that
and
i
am
quoting,
"recognized
a
moral
obligation
to
provide
a
remedy
whereby
schools
may
recover
the
complete
amount
of
expenses
incurred
by
them
prior
to
june
of
1972,
in
reliance
on"
the
invalidated
mandated
services
act,
and
which
conferred
jurisdiction
on
the
new
york
court
of
claims
"to
hear,
audit
and
determine"
the
claims
of
nonprofit
private
schools
for
such
expenses.
thus
the
act
explicitly
authorized
what
the
district
court's
injunction
had
explicitly
prohibited,
reimbursement
to
sectarian
schools
for
their
expenses
of
performing
state-mandated
services
through
the
1971-1972
academic
year.
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
upheld
the
validity
of
this
new
law,
and
its
judgment
is
before
us
in
the
present
case.
for
the
reasons
stated
and
in
an
opinion
file
with
the
clerk
today,
we
hold
that
the
new
york
law
is
constitutionally
invalid
and
accordingly
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
have
filed
a
dissenting
statement
and
mr.
justice
white
who
also
dissents
has
filed
a
separate
dissenting
opinion.
