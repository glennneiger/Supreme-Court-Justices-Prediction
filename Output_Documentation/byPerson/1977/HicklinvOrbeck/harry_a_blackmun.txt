justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
fourteenth
amendment
claim
passed
on
that?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
wagstaff,
would
your
position
here
be
precisely
the
same
if
alaska
restricted
its
residency
requirement
to
employment
directly
by
the
state?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
wagstaff,
suppose
that
alaska
set
up
a
wpa
project
as
we
knew
in
the
preparation.
that
is
a
little
bit
before
your
time
maybe,
but
is
designed
specifically
by
the
state
to
relieve
the
unemployment
amongst
state
residents
and
restricted
it
to
state
residents,
would
you
be
here
attacking
that
one
too?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
building
roads
and
this
kind
of
thing.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
can
understand
perhaps
why
you
would
prefer
residents,
but
how
about
residence
for
a
year?
why
do
you
insist
on
a
year?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
would
suppose
that
you
would
say
then
that
certainly
in
the
stateâ€™s
own
employment
it
could
put
on
the
same
condition?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
general
lorensen,
with
respect
to
this
one-third
of
the
land
in
the
state
that
is
owned
by
alaska,
i
take
it
your
theory
would
justify
a
statute
which
said
that
any
purchaser
of
any
portion
of
that
land
must,
as
long
as
he
owns
the
land,
put
preference
in
employment
to
alaska
residents
and
require
his
purchaser
to
do
the
same
so
that
forever,
for
one-third
of
the
state,
the
employment
preference
could
be
restricted
to
alaska
residents.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
under
your
view
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause,
would
it
forbid
the
alaska
legislature
from
requiring
all
private
employers
to
hire
alaskans
first?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let
me
ask
you
something
different,
just
short
of
that.
what
test
do
you
think
is
applicable
under
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
to
test
a
law
like
that?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
are
there
just
any
reasons?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
was
not
here.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
suppose
we
reject
your
mccready
principle
then
we
reach
this,
you
still
have
to
think
the
toomer
problem.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
is
why
i
am
asking
you.
if
you
rejected
mccready
principle,
would
there
really
be
any
difference
between
this
law
and
a
law
which
required
a
preference
in
all
private
employment?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
there
is
still
a
valid
independent
reason
and,
that
is
that
the
state
seeks
it
is
a
bootleg
reason,
is
it
not?
you
just
have
a
provision
in
your
state
constitution
that
says
you
may
do
this
so
you
must
do
it.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
maybe
it
could
and
maybe
it
could
not.
but
in
this
case,
the
state
does
not
seek
to
justify
it
under
any
such
powers,
but
rather
only
on
a
limited
foundation
that
in
this
case
we
are
dealing
with
assets
that
are
owned
by
the
state
as
owner.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
does
own.
you
do
not
quarrel
with
that,
do
you?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
own.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
that
an
argument
that
it
can
prevail
even
if
we
do
not
overrule
mccready?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
do
not
think
it
was
an
arguable
case
anyway,
do
you?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
was
a
summary
disposition.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
which
is
why
it
was
per
curiam.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
we
have
suggested
that
perhaps
summary
decisions
are
less
authoritative
even
for
us.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
exactly.
