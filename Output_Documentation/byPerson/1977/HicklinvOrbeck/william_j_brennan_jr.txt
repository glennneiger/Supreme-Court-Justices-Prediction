the
other
case
77-324
hicklin
v.
orbeck
is
here
from
the
supreme
court
of
alaska.
the
supreme
court
of
alaska
sustained
the
constitutionality
of
an
alaska
statute
of
popularly
known
as
the
alaska
hire
act.
hire
is
spelled
h-i-r-e
and
that
law
requires
all
alaskan
oil
and
gas
leases,
easements
or
right
away
permits
for
oil
and
gas
pipelines
in
the
certain
specified
oil
agreements.
to
contain
a
requirement
that
qualifying
alaska
residents
must
be
hired
in
preference
to
non-residents,
and
that
employment
preference
is
administered
by
providing
persons
meeting
certain
statutory
requirement
for
alaskan
residency
with
what
i
call
resident
cards
that
can
be
presented
to
a
covered
employer
as
proof
of
the
job
applicants
alaska
residency.
well,
appellants
are
not
residents
of
alaska
and
although
wanting
jobs
are
covered
by
the
act,
can't
get
them
because
they
can't
qualify
for
the
necessary
resident
cards.
so,
they
brought
this
suit
challenging
alaska
hire
as
violative
of
both
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
of
article
4
section
2
and
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
alaska
supreme
court
held
that
neither
provision
was
violated
and
we
reverse,
we
hold
for
reasons
slated
in
the
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
that
alaska
hire
is
invalid
under
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
which
provides
that
the
citizens
of
each
state
shall
be
entitled
to
all
privileges
and
immunities
of
citizens
in
the
several
states.
we,
therefore,
reverse
and
have
no
occasion
to
address
the
question
whether
the
alaska
hire
also
violates
the
equal
protection
clause.
