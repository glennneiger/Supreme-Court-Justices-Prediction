justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
really
talking
just
about
pipeline
or
oil
employment,
are
not
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
is
no
reason
why
a
nonresident
cannot
go
up
there
and
start
manufacturing
widgets.
he
would
not
violate
this
law.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
alaska
has
not
prohibited
that
sort
of
thing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
am
not
sure
i
got
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
question.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
am
not
sure
i
have
got
it
correct.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
then
alaska
had
provided
that
only
residents
could
work
on
the
state-funded
wpa
project.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
realized
that,
but
would
you
feel
that
you
had
substantial
constitutional
grounds
if
alaska
had
enacted
such
a
law
and
your
clients
were
excluded
because
of
nonresidency?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
a
state
cannot
use
its
own
tax
moneys
to
relieve
unemployment
among
its
own
residents?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
alaska
native
claim
settlement
act,
a
lot
of
people
are
not
interesting
in
just
sitting
at
home
and
getting
a
check
every
month
to
buy
groceries,
they
want
work.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
page
is
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
position
then
is
that
alaska
could
not
even
prohibit
hiring
someone,
say,
from
kansas
or
texas,
who
simply
apply
to
an
alaska
firm
that
they
could
not
require
the
people
even
to
show
up
in
alaska
before
they
were
hired.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
would
help
the
unemployed,
even
under
the
view
that
the
supreme
court
of
alaska?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
one-year
provision
was
struck
down
by
the
majority.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
alaska
require
that
candidates
for
public
office
be
residents
of
alaska?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
that
different
from
this?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
is
not
much
of
an
answer,
is
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
one
would
think
though
that
would
be
quite
illegitimate,
there
is
a
kind
of
self‑perpetuation
scheme
built
in
by
the
legislature
to
make
sure
that
the
people
do
not
have
a
right
to
choose
anybody
but
people
who
have
been
around
alaska
for
quite
a
while.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
only
exists,
it
has
been
upheld
by
the
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
suppliers,
the
act
applies
to
our
employees
of
suppliers,
not
to
the
supplier
themselves,
i
take
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
supplier
himself
or
itself
need
not
be
an
alaska
resident?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
supreme
court
of
alaska
threw
it
out
on
state
constitutional
grounds.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
is
not
here
because
they
also
relied
on
state
counts.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
would
not
say
that
the
state
could
require
that
all
the
oil
taken
out
of
the
lands
it
owns
in
alaska
be
used
only
in
alaska?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
from
a
constitutional
point
of
view,
is
that
an
independent
basis
as
contrasted
to
a
legislature
simply
deciding
without
any
constitutional
mandate
that
it
wants
to
do
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
either
case,
you
are
being
challenged
on
federal
constitutional
grounds.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
are
you
reading
from?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
assume
the
legislature
invoked
the
same
reasons
that
it
did
here
with
respect
to
employment
on
state
property,
namely
that
alaska
has
a
high
employment
rate
and
we
intend
to
give
an
economic
benefit
to
alaska
residents.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
wagstaff,
do
you
think
that
the
alaska
state
bar
can
impose
a
residency
requirement?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can
see
it
as
our
cases
hold
that
the
residency
requirement
for
admission
to
the
state
bar
is
permissive.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
mccarthy
was
per
curiam
opinion,
is
that
one
of
the
distinctions
you
would
draw?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
feel,
therefore,
that
it
is
less
authoritative?
