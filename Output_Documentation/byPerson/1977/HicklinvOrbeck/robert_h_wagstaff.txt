mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
in
1972,
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
alaska
adapted
a
law
which
gives
a
residents’
preference
to
all
designated
alaska
residents
in
any
job
having
to
do
with
oil
and
gas
within
the
state.
the
exact
mechanism
is
that
the
law
requires
that
any
person
or
party,
who
has
a
contract
with
the
state
in
nature
of
a
lease
or
right
away
permit
or
the
like
to
preferentially
hire
alaska
residents
and
to
first
fire
the
residents
of
other
states.
it
is
an
across
the
board
preference
to
all
alaska
residents.
the
scope
or
the
swath
that
this
cuts
is
quite
broad.
it
applies
not
only
to
these
contractors.
it
applies
to
their
subcontractors
and
suppliers
as
well.
it
does
not
have
to
take
place
on
state
land.
we
believe
that
this
is
a
direct
violation
of
the
privileges
of
the
immunities
clause
of
the
constitution.
the
supreme
court
of
alaska
split
3:2
on
this
issue.
we
are
asserting
before
this
court
the
dissents
of
justices
bucci
and
rabinovitz,
and
the
alaska
supreme
court
which
we
feel
articulates
exactly
our
position.
there
is
also
a
14th
amendment
claim
presented
as
well.
the
use
of
the
word
“residents”
in
context
of
alaska
hire
means
domiciliary.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
yes,
it
was.
it
was
denied
as
well
by
the
majority.
the
preference
is
given
to
all
residents,
who
are
defined
under
the
statute
as
domiciliary.
the
purported
legislative
reasons
or
justification
for
what
is
called
“alaska
hire”
is
chronic
unemployment
within
the
state
of
alaska.
the
supreme
court
of
alaska,
it
is
our
position
i
believe
that
appellees
disagree,
recognized
that
this
was
a
transparency
and
that
in
fact,
this
was
simply
a
broad‑based
economic
preference
given
to
all
alaska
residents
in
preference
to
the
residents
of
other
states.
additionally,
alaska
hire
itself
supports
that
position
adapted
by
the
supreme
court.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
that
issue,
of
course,
the
state
employment
issue
is
much
different
than
this
case.
alaska
does
have
a
case
state
v.
lilly
decided
dealing
with
governmental
employment.
my
personal
belief
is
that
i
do
not
feel
that
it
is
proper
to
discriminate
against
the
residents
of
other
states
even
in
state
employment
as
well
or
public
contracts.
i
realized
that
mccarthy
versus
philadelphia
commission
might
indicate
otherwise,
but
that
issue,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
is
not
really
relevant
to
this
case
because
we
are
talking
about
private
employment
here,
not
governmental
employment
or
not
public
contract.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
oil
and
gas,
as
far
as
this
law
goes,
is
so
far.
the
employment
covered
is
all
employment
that
results
from
such
activities.
the
supreme
court
of
alaska
has
recognized
that
this
includes
distribution
and
refineries
such
as
that
they
may
be
built
in
the
state
of
alaska.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
not
this
specific
law.
but
in
terms
of
the
danger
of
the
law,
if
the
widgets
came
from
a
natural
resource
or
had
any
sort
of
arguable
natural
resource
nexus
in
alaska,
then
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
concept
of
this
law.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
not
at
this
time.
not
yet.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
mr.
justice
blackmun,
those
would
be
public
works
type
projects
working
on
public
works.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
building
roads
actually
employed
by
the
state.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
of
course,
that
is
a
different
issue
and
we
would
not
be
here
under
alaska
hire
on
that
issue.
i
think
that
issue
has
been
addressed
in
other
cases.
there
are
three
levels
of
looking
at
it
that
particular
issue.
there
is
the
direct
government
employment,
the
employment
by
private
contractors
on
government
projects
and
what
we
have
here
is
strictly
private
activity,
not
taking
place
on
state
lands.
the
only
nexus
that
the
state
asserts
is
that
they
own
the
resources
involved
here,
oil
and
gas
and
therefore,
they
can
do
whatever
they
want
to
with
them.
they
can
make
any
requirements
whatsoever
with
regard
to
their
utilization.
of
course,
this
is
one
step
even
beyond
that.
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
extraction.
it
is
the
jobs
created
as
a
result
of
the
oil
and
gas
development.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
yes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
his
question,
as
i
recall,
it
would
bézier
if
this
was
a
wpa
project.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
no,
this
is
a
different
case
than
that.
we
would
not
bézier
if
that
was
what
was
going
on.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
yes,
i
do.
i
do
think
that
would
be
a
constitutional
violation
on
privileges
and
immunities
if
residents
of
other
states
were
excluded
from
this.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
it
can,
just
so
long
as
it
does
not
violate
the
constitution
and
specific
other
types
of
projects.
for
instance,
the
dissent
in
the
hicklin
case
in
alaska
that
said
such
things
as
job
training,
such
things
as
the
alaska
native
claim
settlement
act
were
good
bona
fide
ways
of
addressing
this
problem
without
discriminating.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
that
is
correct.
but,
i
do
not
think
the
state
can
discriminate
against
the
residents
of
other
states
in
such
activities.
and
this
is
we
are
talking
directly
about
public
employment,
as
i
understand
the
question.
that
is
my
belief
and
my
position.
again,
it
is
certainly
not
necessary
to
reach
that
in
order
to
meet
the
issue
in
this
case.
the
alaska
supreme
court
made
it
clear
that
they
were
deciding
this
as
a
broad
economic
preference,
flatly
stated,
to
alaska
residents.
there
is
a
real
question,
factually
or
functionally
as
to
whether
or
not
alaska
indeed
owns
the
resources.
the
resources,
oil
and
gas,
are
actually
being
extracted
by
private
industry.
the
state
has
a
claim
to
the
subsurface
resources
where
they
are
being
extracted
from.
there
also
is
a
strong
national
interest
that
has
been
recognized
by
congress
twice
in
alaska
oil
and
gas.
once
in
the
trans-alaska
pipeline
act
and
more
recently
in
the
alaska
gas
transportation
act
of
1976,
in
which
congress
makes
a
specific
finding
of
a
national
interest.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
i
do
not
think
there
really
is
that
much
difference,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
state,
in
alaska
and
i
am
sure
in
other
states,
can
usually
find
some
sort
of
nexus
or
tangential
relationship
with
the
governmental
activity
or
ownership
or
proprietary
interest,
so
that
it
can
offer
this
justification
in
other
jobs
as
well.
that
is
one
of
the
things
that
the
dissent
noted.
this
would
apply
to
agriculture
in
alaska
lumber
or
anything
else
if
the
legislature
wishes
to
expand
it
that
far.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
they
do.
they
have
some
nexus.
most
of
the
crates
that
they
are
shipped
in
come
from
alaska
lumber.
but,
there
would
be
some
nexus
possibly
in
that
to
that
extent.
the
state
can
always
find
reason
that
it
has
a
touch
upon
the
particular
job
involved.
that
is
one
of
the
real
dangers
of
alaska
hire.
it
is
how
much
further
under
this
theory
of
state
ownership
of
resources,
can
it
be
expanded?
of
course,
if
alaska
does
it,
any
other
state
can
and
i
think,
predictably,
will.
i
think
that
alaska’s
problems
are
real,
but
they
are
not
that
much
different
than
many
other
states
at
this
time
or
any
other
time.
i
think
that
under
some
of
the
cases
that
we
sited
in
our
brief,
the
proper
way
of
dealing
with
these
types
of
problems
is
not
by
isolation
and
dealing
with
them
separately
that
a
state
cannot
insulate
itself
from
what
is
termed
in
some
commerce
clause
cases
as
a
national
welfare.
the
same
national
welfare
has
a
legitimate
national
public
interest
in
the
resources
themselves.
alaska
is
seeking
really
to
isolate
itself
from
the
nation
and
from
the
union
in
dealing
with
these
particular
problems.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
it
is
covered
specifically
by
statute,
mr.
justice
stevens,
and
it
appears
on
the
definitional
section
within
the
appendix.
there
is
a
definition
of
residents
within
there,
what
a
resident
is.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
page
12,
he
must
maintain
a
place
of
residency
within
the
state,
most
importantly,
must
show
by
all
attending
circumstances
that
his
intent
is
to
make
alaska
his
permanent
residence.
it
is
a
clear
domiciliary
situation.
additionally,
the
alaska
supreme
court,
the
majority
spent
some-five
pages
talking
about
the
steps
that
a
state
can
go
to
ensure
that
this
is
a
person,
who
actually
has
made
the
commitment
to
alaska,
not
simply
just
to
come
there
in
order
to
meet
the
30-day
requirement.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
that
is
correct.
actually,
coming
there
is
a
different
and
habituating
there
at
the
time
is
different,
although
there
is
a
position
in
our
right
to
travel
argument
that
if
you
actually
have
to
go
there
before
you
qualify
for
a
job,
it
discourages
job
applications
from
other
states
and
people
cannot
make
inquiries
as
they
historically
have
done
in
alaska
by
letter.
they
actually
have
to
make
a
commitment
to
travel
and
spend
considerable
amount
of
money
to
get
that
far.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
that
is
correct.
i
can
see
no
justification
for
that.
the
state
of
alaska
based
its
opinion,
the
ownership
theory,
strictly
and
exclusively
on
mccready
versus
virginia,
which
if
it
has
not
been
overruled
and
not
been
severely
limited,
should
be
today.
the
state
feels,
as
i
have
stated,
that
because
they
believe
that
they
own
the
resources,
they
can
do
with
them
as
they
see
fit.
mccready
is
highly
distinguishable
and
it
has
been
severely
limited
by
the
toomer
case,
in
which
this
court
refused
to
expand
it
any
further
than
it
already
was,
which
was
very
narrow
and
relates
of
course
to
the
planning
of
oysters
and
the
tidal
waters
of
the
ware
river
and
virginia,
and
deals
with
access
or
planting
of
oysters
to
state
property.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
resulting
employment.
of
course,
in
alaska,
the
oil
and
gas
is
in
commerce.
we
believe
it
falls
directly
under
the
foster-fountain
v.
louisiana
shrimp
holding
that
as
the
state
relinquishes
all
ownership
claims,
such
as
they
may
even
exist,
when
it
places
and
permits
the
resources
which
it
purports
to
own
to
go
into
commerce.
that
is
typically
what
is
happening
here.
that
is
the
way
alaska
makes
money
off
oil
and
gases,
having
them
sold
in
other
states.
the
mccready
case,
of
course,
is
limited
as
well
to
fish
and
game,
in
which
there
is
a
historical
exception
or
public
interest
that
the
court
talks
about
at
length
in
geer
versus
connecticut
which
is
totally
different,
we
believe,
than
natural
resources
in
general.
it
is
talking
about
common
property
that
is
property
that
is
owned
jointly
by
all
the
people
of
the
state
which
fish
and
game
had
historically
been
thought
to
be,
which
is
different
and
distinguishable
than
property
ownership
in
chief
or
in
general.
also,
mccready
is
a
conservation
case,
as
was
corfield
versus
coryell
and
as
was
asserted
in
geer
versus
connecticut.
this
case
has
nothing
to
do
with
conservation
whatsoever.
it
has
to
do
with
exploitation
and
development.
the
conservation
argument
was
made
in
toomer
versus
witsell
as
well.
mccready,
as
was
recognized
by
the
court
in
toomer,
is
the
only
case
that
has
ever
been
decided
by
this
court,
in
which
there
are
no
persuasive
independent
reasons
for
the
discrimination.
the
court
then,
in
1948,
refused
to
expand
mccready
to
encompass
any
other
areas.
i
think
this
court
should
do
the
same
thing
today
because
there
are
no
independent
reasons
for
alaska
hire,
regardless
of
the
purported
legislative
purposes.
it
is
an
across
the
board
economic
preference
for
all
alaska
residents.
the
supreme
court
of
alaska
recognized
such,
but
said
it
was
justified
because
the
state
owned
the
resources.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
it
is
a
legitimate
concern.
i
do
not
think
it
is
properly
addressed
by
alaska
hire
because
if
it
is
indeed
the
unemployed,
who
are
going
to
be
benefited,
then
it
is
those
that
should
be
given
the
preference.
but,
it
is
not
just
them.
it
is
the
employed.
it
is
all
alaskans.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
these
jobs
that
we
are
talking
about,
particularly
are
of
extremely
high-paying
and
extremely
desirable.
it
is
very
common
for
people
to
quit
other
jobs
including,
actually
several
attorneys
i
have
known
who
have
gone
to
work
on
the
pipeline.
of
course,
there
will
be
another
pipeline.
the
gas
pipeline
is
going
to
be
built
probably
in
the
next
year
or
two.
of
course,
this
will
apply
to
any
other
gas
exploration
and
development
within
oil
and
gas
within
the
state,
of
which
it
is
predicted,
there
will
be
a
great
--
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
yes,
it
is
a
reason
and
it
does
exist.
has
it
existed
elsewhere?
if
you
are
talking
about
the
lowest
level
of
test
that
you
could
apply
to
it,
you
could
say
there
is
some
possible
reason
here
that
the
legislature
may
have
articulated
and
that
reason
was
rejected
specifically
by
the
supreme
court
of
alaska.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
it
said
that
this
is
simply
an
economic
preference.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
no.
the
trial
judge
found
that
these
were
legitimate
needs
and
they
had
been
addressed
by
statute.
the
alaska
supreme
court
rejected
that
reasoning
and
said,
“we
rather
prefer
and
believe
that
the
alaska
hire
is
simply
a
preference.”
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
yes,
economic
preference
to
all
alaskans,
not
just
the
unemployed.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
if
they
were
unemployed
alaskans,
yes.
but,
it
was
not
the
preference
that
is
not
restricted
to
them.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
that
is
correct.
that
is
the
whole
point
of
the
case
and
that
it
is
impermissible
to
do
so.
the
unemployed
justification
for
it,
first
of
all,
was
rejected
by
the
alaska
supreme
court.
secondly,
it
is
not
valid
in
it
of
itself
because
the
states
can
always
find
reasons
of
that
nature
and
this,
of
course,
has
been
articulated.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
they
enacted
it.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
yes,
they
wanted
to
give
preference
to
alaska
residents.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
that
is
exactly
what
they
have
done
and
we
believe,
impermissibly
so.
the
state
does
not
have
that
power
to
give
preference
to
its
residents
in
resulting
employment
from
oil
and
gas
exploration
in
alaska,
particularly
so,
when
the
oil
and
gas
is
in
commerce
as
it
is
here.
that
is
how
money
is
made.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
yes,
it
could
cover
any
state
natural
resource
that
it
purportedly
or
believes
that
it
owns
like
gold,
coal,
or
anything
of
that
nature.
of
course,
any
state
can
do
that
as
well.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
yes,
they
would
have
to
establish
permanent
residency.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
yes,
it
was
limited
to
30
days.
of
course,
this
is
done
by
the
enforcement
procedure
as
you
apply
for
a
residency
card.
the
burden
is
on
the
applicant.
the
residency
card
is
good
for
two
years
and
this
entitles
you
to
the
preference
of
your
cardholder.
but
as
far,
mr.
chief
justices
says,
the
gold
situation
is
concerned,
if
that
were
considered
a
state
resource
which
it
would
and
the
dissent
clearly
points
out
to
how
much
further
this
law
can
go.
it
predictably
would.
then,
it
would
apply
to
gold
as
well
and
only
in
terms
of
employment.
not,
we
are
talking
about
extraction.
in
terms
of
employment
in
the
gold
industry
that
residents
would
be
preferred
in
all
employment.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
yes,
it
can.
it
can
and
has,
i
think
properly.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
there
are
some
legitimate
exceptions
if
they
be
deemed
such
to
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause,
and
i
believe
that
a
state
cannot
discriminate
against
the
citizen
of
another
state
unless
there
is
a
substantial
compelling
and
legitimate
interest
that
is
being
further
thereby
and
the
means
chosen
is
the
least
drastic.
their
voting
is
one
such
category.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
that
is
how
the
state
government
is
controlled.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
i
think,
as
far
as
the
controlling
of
how
state
government
is
created,
how
the
people
choose
the
persons
to
govern
that
state,
that
it
is
legitimate
in
that
context.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
the
legitimate
state
interest
is
to
keep
people,
i
suppose.
i
am
not
defending
that
position.
i
just
recognizing
that
it
exists.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
yes,
it
has
been
upheld.
it
is
to
keep
people
from
coming
across
state
lines.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
excuse
me,
justice
white?
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
yes.
there
are
some
others
too
as
well
that
have
been
recognized.
for
instance,
tuition
differentials
in
cases
had
been
recognized
as
allowing
a
state
who
has
created
the
institutions.
the
taxpayers
of
that
state
have
paid
for
it
to
discriminate
in
differentials
for
tuition.
but,
that
is
the
least
drastic.
in
state
students
are
not
given
preference
as
they
are
in
alaska
hire.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
yes,
i
do.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
is
a
disagreement
among
the
parties
over
what
the
alaska
supreme
court
has
ruled.
however,
it
is
our
position,
as
i
have
attempted
to
amplify
to
the
court
in
the
reply
brief
that
the
alaska
court
rejected
the
legislative
findings
as
being
any
sort
of
justification
or
any
sort
of
basis
for
alaska
hire
and
rather
found
that
it
is
simply
an
across
the
boards
economic
preference
given
to
alaska
residents
that
the
state
has
the
right
to
do
because
it
owns
the
resources.
the
independent
reasons
asserted,
the
independent
reasons
being
high-end
employment,
were
rejected
by
the
supreme
court.
but,
even
if
they
are
considered,
they
do
not
in
and
of
themselves
justify
discrimination
against
residents
of
other
states
just
because
of
unique
problems,
if
they
exist
at
all,
in
alaska
because
as
i
have
tried
to
argue
with
every
state
at
least
in
its
own
eyes,
has
its
own
unique
problems
and
unique
attributes.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
it
does
impose
a
residency
requirement.
of
course,
there
are
cases
in
this
court,
as
i
recall,
affirming
without
opinion
of
the
new
mexico
case
several
years
ago
indicates
that
it
is
constitutionally
valid.
i
personally,
again,
see
no
justification
for
a
residency
requirement
for
admission
to
the
bar
because
you
do
not
have
to
remain
a
resident
once
you
are
admitted
to
practice
law,
at
least
in
alaska.
the
theory,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
it
gives
the
state
board
of
bar
examiners
an
opportunity
to
examine
the
person’s
qualification,
if
they
are
actually
there.
i
think
a
domiciliary
requirement
does
not
meet
that
particular
need.
it
is
not
necessary
that
the
person
is
physically
present.
i
think
that
is
adequate.
but,
again,
that
holding
certainly
is
not
necessary
to
this
particular
case.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
yes,
that
is
one
of
the
exceptions
similar
to
the
boating
professional
licensing,
divorce,
if
you
want
to
think
it
in
those
terms,
possibly
municipal
employment
under
the
mccarthy
opinion,
and
the
receipt
of
welfare.
exception
is
perhaps
the
wrong
word.
it
is
instances
where
a
state
is
showing
a
substantial
compelling
and
legitimate
need
which
it
has
the
burden
to
show.
of
course,
i
believe
as
mr.
justice
stevens
has
suggested
that
a
state
could
justify
a
law
like
alaska
hire
under
its
general
regulatory
powers,
not
simply
we
own
it.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
yes,
that
it
purports
to
own,
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
own
in
the
sense
of
being
able
to
restrict
it,
i
do
not
think
you
can.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
yes,
it
does.
it
is
entitled
to
the
portion
of
the
money
from
the
sale
of
it.
that
is
correct.
the
mccready
case
itself
does
not
deal
specifically
with
ownership
because
fish
and
game
direct
ownership.
fish
and
game
is
owned
by
the
people
of
the
state
and
the
state,
in
that
case,
was
recognized
as
the
trustee,
the
party
having
the
proprietary
interest
to
assert
this.
mccready
is
not
directly
helpful
to
them
on
that
particular
point.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
yes,
it
is
because
this
is
a
different
type
of
ownership.
it
is
not
a
trustee
representation
of
something
that
is
owned
collectively
by
the
people.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
planting
oysters
in
the
tidelands
of
the
ware
river,
access
to
this
had
nothing
to
do
with
sale
or
jobs
or
anything
else.
it
was
just
whether
or
not
the
state
could
restrict
access
to
its
own
residents.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
yes?
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
it
is
a
different
case.
of
course,
that
is
the
state
employment
issue.
i
still
believe
that
those
circumstances
would
be
a
violation
of
privileges
and
immunities
clause.
i
do
not
think
the
public
employment
–
not
the
public
employment
but
the
public
contracting,
public
works
doctrine
should
be
any
longer
valid.
(inaudible)
theory
of
employment
is
on
public
works,
i
think,
has
been
rejected
by
this
court.
it
seems
to
me,
under
the
existing
law,
their
contractors
which
the
state
has
an
interest
for
hiring
directly,
then
under
existing
law,
it
would
be
a
violation
of
privileges
and
immunities.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
yes,
i
certainly
do.
mccarthy
was
involved,
the
fireman.
it
was
a
per
curiam
decision.
there
are
other
articulable
reasons
for
municipal
employment
justifications
such
as
knowing
in
the
policeman’s
case
or
the
fireman’s
case,
knowing
what
the
city
is
like,
having
a
feel
for
the
people
in
the
city,
and
things
of
that
nature
that
are
different
and
additional
reasons.
with
an
oil
company
employee,
those
reasons
simply
do
not
exist.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
i
said
that
in
the
sense
that
that
was
not
fully
analyzed
as
i
recall
in
a
particular
opinion
as
to
the
specific
reasons
for
uniqueness
of
municipal
employment.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
i
do
not
believe
it
was.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
in
my
judgment,
it
is,
in
trying
to
seek
guidance
from
it.
the
fact
that
it
was
not
argued
and
it
is
a
per
curiam
opinion,
it
does
carry
less
weight
with
me
as
an
attorney,
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
especially
for
us.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
i
see
that
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
