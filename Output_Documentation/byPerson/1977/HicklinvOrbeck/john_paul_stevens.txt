justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wagstaff,
would
you
help
me
with
one
thing?
as
i
understand
it,
they
held
unconstitutional
one
year
residency
requirement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
exactly
is
it
other
than
being
in
the
state
for
30
days
that
your
clients
must
do
in
order
to
be
eligible
for
work?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would
not
object
to
the
residence,
i
suppose,
because
i
guess
he
has
got
to
live
in
alaska
during
the
work.
the
main
objection
is
to
the
declaration
of
intent
to
make
it
a
permanent
residence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
lorensen,
is
it
fair
to
analogize
this
to
sort
of
a
monopolist,
who
imposes
a
tying
clause
on
its
customers?
if
you
want
my
product,
you
have
got
to
accept
this
condition
in
order
to
get
the
product,
namely,
employ
people
i
designate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
lorensen,
is
that
a
valid
argument?
if
your
position
is
correct,
why
could
not
another
state
that
did
not
own
the
resources
itself
but
just
sought
to
regulate
them
and
say
that
anybody
who
works
in
oil
that
comes
out
of
louisiana,
say,
shall
be
a
louisiana
resident
for
the
same
reason
that
you
want
to
protect
your
citizens
from
unemployment
and
the
like.
why
could
louisiana
not
do
the
same
saying
that
in
our
regulatory
power
over
resources
that
have
their
source
in
the
state
will
exercise
this
kind
of
jurisdiction?
why
would
that
not
be
equally
reasonable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
have
the
same
interference
here.
the
only
difference
is
that
you
happen
to
be
the
legal
owner
instead
of
just
the
sovereign
that
has
the
power
to
decide
what
happens
to
the
resource.
should
that
make
a
difference
when
you
are
talking
about
the
exercise
of
a
governmental
function?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
be
precisely
the
same
statute,
except
that
louisiana
might
not
say
with
respect
to
oil
we
own,
but
just
the
oil
that
the
other
oil
companies
own
that
comes
out
of
louisiana.
it
is
a
state
resource
and
because
it
is
a
subject
to
our
jurisdiction
we
will
impose
this
kind
of
employment
condition
just
as
you
have.
would
they
not
have
the
same
motivation
and
same
justification
for
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mccready
does
not
deal
with
employment
of
other
persons
in
using
the
resource,
does
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
were
starting
to
say
when
we
interrupted
you
that
this
would
not
have
a
broad
impact
in
the
other
states
because
alaska
is
peculiar
in
that
it
owns
a
great
quantity
of
developable
resources.
but,
it
is
true,
is
it
not
that
any
land
anywhere
is
a
developable
resource
either
for
farming
or
for
building
an
office
building
or
for
whatever?
not
that
that
weakens
your
basic
argument
but,
certainly,
the
impact
of
this
case
would
not
be
confined
to
the
state
of
alaska.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
western
states.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
percentage
of
the
area
of
alaska
is
owned
by
the
state?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
about
almost
two-thirds
by
the
united
states.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
individual
private
land
owners?
justice
john
paul
stevens
own
1%
of
the
whole.
justice
john
paul
stevens
federal
government
has
at
least
one
statute
that
imposes
conditions
with
which
those
who
contract
with
the
federal
government
have
to
comply,
is
that
not
true,
the
davis
bacon
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
does
require
a
certain
level
of
compensation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
argue
that
alaska
could
provide
that
people
who
lease
or
buy
its
property
as
a
condition
of
that
lease
have
to
employ
only
white
people?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there
is
a
limit
on
the
conditions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
the
state,
even
as
owner,
can
impose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
relying
on
the
stateâ€™s
power
as
owner
to
contract
with
respect
to
the
property
which
it
owns?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
your
sole
reliance,
is
it
not?
that
is
your
basic
reliance.
you
begin
with
that
premise.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
do
concede
clearly
that
there
are
limitations.
you
just
have.
you
said
that
they
could
not
require
only
white
people
be
the
part.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any
difference
between
its
power
as
a
contractor
and
its
power
as
an
owner?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
basically
the
same,
is
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
commerce
clause.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
historically,
the
homesteading
was
basically
used
to
be
a
federal
program
and
it
was
for
new
comers
primarily,
was
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
know,
with
respect
to
homesteading,
whether
historically
there
had
been
residential
restrictions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
do
not
either.
i
was
just
asking
for
information.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mccready
did
not
involve
transient,
fugitive,
why
a
wife
would
rather
suddenly
tear
oysters
or
plant
oysters?
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
even
for
us.
