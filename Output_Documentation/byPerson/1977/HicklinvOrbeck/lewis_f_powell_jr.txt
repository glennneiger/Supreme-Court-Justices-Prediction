what
percentage
of
this
state
workforce
would
be
affected
by
this
act?
i
think
the
brief
said
“roughly
6%”?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
would
that
be
true
if
you
had
included
suppliers,
as
well
as
contractors
or
subcontractors
or
lessees?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
you
could
under
the
act?

justice

f.
powell,

earlier
in
your
arguments
you
emphasized
the
fact
that
the
employment
here
was
private.
assume
that
alaska
undertook
to
perform
all
of
their
functions
that
it
now
leashes
out
that
is
drilling
the
oil
gas
and
constructing
and
operating
a
pipeline
perhaps
for
refinery
so
that
the
people
employed
would
be
employees
directly
of
the
state.
would
that
make
a
difference
to
your
position?

in
mccarthy,
we
were
dealing
with
employees
of
the
city
of
philadelphia,
as
i
recall.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
would
you
draw
a
distinction
between
city
employees,
on
one
hand,
performing
public
functions
and
employees
of
alaska
in
an
example
i
gave
you?
