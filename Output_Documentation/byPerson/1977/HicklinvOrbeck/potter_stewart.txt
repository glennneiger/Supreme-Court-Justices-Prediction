is
not
the
fact
of
unemployment
among
alaska
residents
appropriately
rational
reason
for
this?
it
does
not
mean
it
is
necessarily
constitutional,
but
it
is
a
reason.
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
the
person
has
a
job
somewhere
else?
he
is
not
a
beneficiary
of
this.
if
he
is
unemployed
and
looking
for
a
job
that
he
is
the
beneficiary,
is
not
it?

i
am
still
not
sure
that
--
i
understood
your
answer
to
my
question
which
was
prompted
by
your
assertion
that
there
was
no
reason
whatsoever.
my
question
was,
is
unemployment
among
alaska
residents
a
reason?
justice

stewart
which
said
what?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
same
thing,
is
not
it?
justice

an
economic
preference,
i.e.
hiring
residents
before
you
hire
a
nonresident.
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
you.
the
whole
point
of
this
case
is
that
it
is
restricted
to
alaska
residents.
justice

stewart
the
alaska
state
legislature
enacted
this
statute.
were
they
crazy
when
they
did
it?
did
they
not
have
some
reason
for
doing
it?
justice
potter
stewart
there
must
have
been
a
reason
behind
it.
justice
potter
stewart
precisely,
that
is
what
they
did.
justice

general
lorensen,
i
have
been
curious.
there
are
some
differences
of
opinion
in
the
briefs
of
these
as
to
the
scope
of
this
statute.
is
the
scope
measured
by
section
38.40.050,
appearing
on
page

of

050
seem
to
be
a
little
broader.
it
must
be
performed
directly
for
the

and
suppliers
of
his

justice
potter
stewart
in
any
event,
you
did
not
cause
petition.
justice
potter
stewart
you
accepted
the
30-day
and,
indeed,
your
brother
on
the
other
side
does
not
quarrel
with
the
30
days
as
such
as
i
understand
it.
