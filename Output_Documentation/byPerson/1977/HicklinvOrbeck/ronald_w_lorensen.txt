mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court.
i
think,
directly
at
the
outset,
it
needs
to
be
pointed
out
that
what
alaska
hire
effects
is
founded
upon
is
state
ownership
of
resources
and
not
just
state
ownership
in
a
more
general
usage
of
the
fact
that
oil
and
gas
may
be
found
within
alaska.
it
is
because
this
oil
and
gas
was
found
on
land
below
land
which
is
owned
by
alaska.
in
a
true
legal
sense
and
despite
what
council
for
the
appellants
would
indicate,
i
do
not
believe
there
is
any
power
in
congress
to
require
that
alaska
sell
or
dispose
of
its
oil
and
gas
as
long
as
it
sits
in
the
ground
and
is
not
held
under
private
leases
by
private
individuals.
what
alaska
has
said
was
that
if
we
are
going
to
lease
this
oil
and
gas
which
we,
the
state,
own
on
behalf
of
our
people,
our
residents,
we
are
going
to
require
certain
conditions.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
yes,
it
would
with
respect
to
the
underlying
justification
of
course.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
yes.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
it
is
repeated
in
two
places,
but
section
050
does
contain
a
scope.
i
think
section
030a
is
really
the
underlying
basis
for
it.
that
section
states
that
in
order
to
protect
and
preserve
rights
of
alaskans
to
employment,
a
certain
provision
shall
be
incorporated
into
oil
and
gas
leases,
pipeline
rights
of
way
where
the
state
is
a
party
to
those
leases
and
rights
of
way.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
yes,
what
050
requires
is
that
a
lessee,
who
leases
the
oil,
agrees
that
he
will
see
to
it
that
his
subcontractors
do
in
fact
also
hire
alaska
residents
with
a
preference.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
and
suppliers.
i
would
point
out,
your
honor,
that
to
this
point,
the
supplier’s
aspect
has
in
fact
not
been
enforced.
we
have
had
our
hands
full
just
enforcing
it
with
respect
to
actual
construction
activity.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
it
would
depend
on
the
nature,
in
which
the
refineries
arose.
if
it
is
built
on
state
land
which
is
lease
for
that
purpose,
yes.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
no,
we
are
not.
are
you
speaking
of
oil
and
gas
which
is
being
refined?
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
alaska
oil
and
gas
which
is
being
refined?
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
yes,
they
do.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
it
applies
to
the
extent
that
there
is
employment
taking
place,
yes.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
it
is
not
the
land,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
yes,
but
it
is
the
employment
activity
which
we
are
regulating.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
yes,
and
i
think
we
have.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
that
is
correct.
at
the
height
of
pipeline
employment,
it
represented
only
6%
of
the
entire
workforce
in
the
state.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
it
may
have
been
somewhat
higher,
mr.
justice
powell,
but,
again,
as
i
indicate,
we
have
not
in
fact
enforce
it
against
suppliers
at
this
point.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
we
could.
we
are
limiting
the
scope
of
suppliers
by
regulations
very
stringently,
however,
to
suppliers
whose
activity
is
95%
directly
related
to
that
activity.
so,
we
do
not
grab
a
small
supplier,
who
really
does
not
have
any
direct
contact
with
the
pipeline.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
it
requires
the
supplier
to
hire
employees,
who
are
alaska
residents.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
no,
that
is
correct.
we
do
not
place
any
requirements
in
terms
of
who
operates
the
business
or
who
the
business
entity
is.
that
is
correct.
so
throughout
your
analysis
of
local
hired,
i
urge
you
to
keep
in
mind
the
fact
that
what
we
are
talking
about
is
the
state
disposing
of
resources
which
it
really
owns
and
disposing
of
them
in
a
way
which
it
sees
would
best
benefit
its
own
residents,
the
people
on
whose
behalf
it
owns
those
resources.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
i
suppose
that
analogy
could
be
made.
i
am
not
experienced
at
all
in
the
area
you
are
speaking
of,
the
anti-trust
area,
so
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
justify.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
mr.
justice
marshall?
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
no,
that
is
correct.
we
do
not
attempt
to
regulate
the
gas
itself
in
any
way.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
only
the
construction
before
gas
is
ever
put
into
it.
it
is
also
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
the
jobs
that
we
are
talking
about
would
not
exist
if
the
state
had
not
granted
these
leases
and
pipeline
rights
of
way
in
the
first
place.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
there
is
no
question
that
alaska
can
use
it
and
will
be
using
the
money
that
it
receives.
that
is
correct.
but,
very
frequently,
the
money
that
the
state
receives,
with
respect
to
individual
residents
of
the
state,
never
has
any
real
impact.
a
school
may
be
built
and
an
individual
or
a
resident
of
the
state
says,
“i
do
not
have
any
children”
or
“my
children
are
no
longer
in
school.”
he
is
a
more
direct
benefit
to
himself
by
finding
himself
being
employed
in
this
type
of
activity
which
is
the
result
of
the
exploitation
of
the
resources
which
he
owns,
really
he
owns.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
it
is
a
substantial
number.
i
do
not
have
any
idea
of
the
number
of
people
on
relief.
i
can
tell
you
that
we
have
the
highest
unemployment
rate
in
the
nation.
we
always
have
in
any
time
of
the
year.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
if
they
declare
themselves
residents,
yes.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
dollars,
that
is
right.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
that
is
right.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
that
aspect
of
the
law
has
now,
of
course,
been
struck
by
the
state
supreme
court.
we
put
forward
what
we
thought
was
a
very
compelling
justification
and
we
showed
by
affidavit
that
it
was
necessary
to
provide
this
year
cushion
especially
for
undertrained
individuals
in
the
state
who
had
undertaken
training
programs
who,
upon
entering
training,
needed
some
assurance
that
they
could
in
fact
look
for
a
job
and
that
they
would
not
be
bypassed
as
soon
as
they
go
out
of
the
training
program
by
new
residents
who
had
come
to
the
state
with
higher
skills
and
higher
qualifications
at
the
outset.
we
put
forward
a
number
of
other
justifications.
i
do
not
think
i
need
to
go
into
them
all.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
it
threw
it
on
both
the
state
and
the
federal
constitution.
we
have
indicated
in
a
footnote
that
we
feel
they
may
have
erred
in
relying
on
the
federal
constitution
analysis.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
that
is
correct.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
that
is
correct.
we
sought
a
basis
for
it
since
it
was
thrown
out.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart,
yes.
now,
both
the
appellants
and
the
dissent
in
the
state
supreme
court
decision
spoke
in
strident
terms
of
the
threat
and
vulcanization
to
our
nation
and
parochial
isolation,
which
would
resolve
if
this
law
were
in
fact
upheld.
i
think
that
if
we
just
stop
to
think
about
it
for
a
moment
that
those
fears
are
more
fears
than
practicality
which
will
ever
arise.
for
one
thing,
i
doubt
that
there
is
any
state
which
owns
the
quantity
of
developable
resources
and
i
guess,
again,
we
are
talking
about
state
ownership
of
developable
resources
in
the
quantity
that
alaska
does.
so,
that
is
a
practical
matter
and
that
would
be
the
extent
of
any
decision
by
this
court
upholding
local
hire.
as
a
practical
matter,
the
implementation
by
the
various
states
would
probably
be
minimal
at
best
because
they
do
not
own
a
lot
of
land.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
that
argument
does
not
form
the
basis
for
our
position
at
all.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
it
may
in
fact
be
reasonable.
i
am
not
sure.
i
have
not
given
that
aspect
a
lot
of
thought.
what
you
run
into
there
is
interference
with
interstate
commerce
problems,
your
west
versus
kansas.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
in
fact,
there
is
no
interference
with
interstate
commerce.
here,
the
situation
which
you
have
propounded,
it
seems
to
me,
would
depend
on
precisely
the
facts
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
an
interference.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
they
may
have
the
same
motivation.
they
do
not
have
the
same
constitutional
underpinnings
to
rely
upon
because
they
cannot
point
to
mccready
to
say
that
this
is
the
basis
for
our
requiring
that
oil
and
gas
employment
be
given
to
alaska
residents
first.
mccready
looks
to
the
ownership
of
the
land.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
no,
the
fact
of
the
situation,
mccready
did
not.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
read
mccready,
i
think
this
court
have
been
presented
with
a
law
that
said
“not
only
must
virginia
residents
plant
oysters,
but
also
any
individuals
hired
by
virginia
residents
to
harvest
those
oysters
must
as
well
be
virginians.
i
think
this
court
would
have
upheld
that
requirement
as
well,
under
the
analysis
provided
in
mccready.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
if
texas
does
in
fact
own
the
oil.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
i
would
certainly
argue
on
behalf
of
texas
that
they
would
have
the
same
constitutional
basis
for
requiring
the
texas
residents
to
be
hired
first.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
that
is
certainly
true.
my
only
point
is
that,
with
respect
to
other
states
who
could
use
the
same
theory,
the
amount
of
land
which
another
state
owns
in
almost
all
cases
is
very
minimal
except
perhaps
for—
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
and
parks.
most
states
have
said
that
the
property
that
states
have
so
long
set
aside
for
parks
and
it
is
no
longer
developable.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
when
transfer
of
all
property
to
the
state
is
finally
completed,
it
would
be
about
one-third
of
the
property
of
the
state.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
except
for
the
transfer
to
the
native
corporations
which
is
presently
in
the
offing.
i
am
not
sure
how
the
split
would
eventually
break
out.
but,
those
will
be
the
three
largest
landholders
in
the
state.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
they
own
about
1%
of
the
land.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
that
is
right.
private
ownership
in
alaska
is
very
minimal
on
land.
the
other
reason
that
we
do
not
think
that
parochialization
and
balkanization
is
something
to
be
feared,
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
there
are
numerous
states
and
we
pointed
it
to
19
or
20
of
them
which
currently
have
statutes
which
require
that
in
public
construction
work
done
for
those
states
or
their
political
subdivisions
that
contractors
performing
network
hire
residents
of
those
states
first.
in
some
cases,
it
is
an
absolute
preference.
in
many
cases,
it
requires
a
durational
aspect.
but,
there
are
a
great
number
of
states
which
currently
require
similar
kinds
of
employment
preferences
for
residents
in
private
employment.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
the
davis
bacon
act,
i
do
not
know
how
that
applies
to
residency.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
it
does.
that
is
the
main
aspect
of
the
davis
bacon
act.
of
course,
the
federal
government
has
now
also
adapted
the
10%
minority
contractor
requirement
which,
i
assume,
will
eventually
get
to
this
court
but
that
is,
again,
another
subject.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
i
would
not
argue
that.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
i
think
so,
yes.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
i
think
so,
yes.
the
state
supreme
court
has
indicated
some
of
the
limitations.
we
have
presented
to
this
court
and
to
the
state
supreme
court
an
alternative
argument
based
simply
on
the
state’s
power
to
contract
without
ever
looking
at
the
exercise
of
its
police
powers
where
the
state
is
the
owner,
where
the
state
wishes
to
be
a
purchaser
that
it
may
do
so
without
the
standard
restrictions
of
due
process
and
equal
protection
requirements.
the
state
supreme
court
rejected
that
with
respect
to
the
one-year
durational
requirement.
it
did
not
address
it
with
respect
to
the
remainder
of
the
law.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
that
is
right.
there
is
no
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
state.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
we
begin
with
the
premise
that
the
state
owns
the
land.
then
we
say,
if
standard
constitutional
principles
are
applied
to
state’s
action,
privileges
and
immunities
clause
is
satisfied
and
the
equal
protection
clause
is
satisfied.
if
a
state
power
to
contract
argument
and
analysis
is
applied,
it
still
is
valid
under
that
absent
the
analysis
under
privileges
and
immunities.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
yes.
not
only
that,
but
with
respect
to
its
power
as
a
proprietor,
it
seems
to
me,
it
would
be
subject
to
the
same
anti-discrimination
laws
and
any
other
private
contractors.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
that
is
an
interesting
question
which
i
have
been
unable
to
resolve
in
terms
of
the
research.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
it
seems
to
me
that
it
should
be
the
same.
the
cases
have
always
addressed
the
state’s
power
to
contract
as
purchaser
rather
than
its
power
to
contract
as
seller.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
yes,
for
state
public
employment.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
no.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
would
be
directly
contrary
to
this
court’s
holdings
in
the
west
virginia
v.
pennsylvania
case.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
that
is
right,
commerce
clause.
that
is
one
of
our
points.
we
are
not
affecting
the
product
or
its
distribution
in
any
way
by
local
hire.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
if
we
are
going
upon
a
state
power
to
contract
theory,
yes,
very
definitely.
in
the
same
way,
it
would
be
my
argument
that
the
state
has
considered
from
time
to
time
and
we
may
find
ourselves
a
position
very
soon
of
once
again
adopting
a
homestead
provision.
it
seems
to
me,
very
clearly,
the
state
can
require
that
only
alaska
residents
participate
in
homesteading
program.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
it
was
to
encourage
people
to
settle
the
land,
whether
the
federal
program
was
for
new
comers
or
just
to
encourage
settlement.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
i
really
do
not
know
that.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
no,
i
do
not.
the
state
has
had
a
mini
homesteading
program
in
the
past
for
recreational
provision,
but
it
cut
that
off
not
too
long
ago.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
no,
it
does
not.
that
is
a
point
that
we
have
made.
mr.
wagstaff
in
his
reply
brief
has
somehow
indicated
that
we
do
not
permit
aliens
to
participate
in
the
program
if
they
are
residents.
that
is
not
in
fact
the
case
to
the
extent
that
he
makes
that
argument.
i
am
not
sure
what
his
basis
for
it
is.
i
would
point
out
as
well
that
the
alaska
legislature
is
charged
with
the
duty
under
the
alaska
constitution,
article
8
section
2,
to
see
to
it
that
the
resources
of
the
state
of
alaska
are
developed
and
utilized
to
the
maximum
benefit
of
its
people.
this
provides
an
independent
and
a
separate
justification
or
a
separate
basis
for
the
legislature
enacting
local
hire.
it
is
charged
with
the
duty
under
the
alaska
constitution
to
maximize
benefits
to
residents.
this
maximizes
those
benefits.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
it
seems
to
me
that
the
constitutional
requirement
places
a
nature
of
a
trust
upon
the
legislature
and
its
relationship
with
that
land
that
may
or
may
not
exist
in
the
absence
of
that
kind
of
a
constitutional
requirement.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
that
is
correct.
i
certainly
am
not
asserting
that
the
alaska
constitution
can
overwrite
the
federal
constitution.
there
is
some
question
as
to
what
the
alaska
supreme
court
did
say
about
local
hire
and
how
it
would
characterize
it.
i
would
just
like
to
read
that
to
you
to
indicate
that
it
did
not
say
that
local
hire
is
simply
an
across
the
board
economic
preference
to
residents.
the
supreme
court
stated
“we
are
hesitant
to
classify
alaska
hire.”
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
i
am
reading
from
–
this
is
the
brief
of
the
appellants
in
their
footnote
7
on
page
7.
it
can
also
be
found
in
their
jurisdictional
statement
in
their
appendix
1
page
19a
which
contains
the
entire
decision.
“we
are
hesitant
to
clarify
alaska.”
this
is
a
miss
typo.
“we
are
hesitant
to
classify
alaska
hire
as
something
other
than
an
attempt
to
strengthen
the
alaskan
economy.”
it
is
an
attempt
to
strengthen
the
alaskan
economy,
not
simply
some
across
the
board
preference
for
residents.
“we
believe
the
better
alternative
is
to
consider
alaska
hire
an
economic
measure
justified
by
the
national
resources
exception.”
then,
they
go
on
into
mccready.
but,
they
do
not
reject
the
notion
that
alaska
hire
was
adopted
to
promote
either
education
or
training
in
the
state.
we
have
presented
numerous
affidavits
to
the
superior
court
indicating
that
training
did,
in
fact,
take
place
to
qualify
alaska
residents
for
these
jobs
as
they
became
available.
training
was
a
very
integral
part
of
the
alaska
hire
program.
it
did
not
operate
in
a
vacuum.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
i
would
not
say
that
it
would
forbid
it.
such
a
requirement
would
not
invoke
the
mccready
principle.
the
question
then
would
be
whether
or
not
there
are,
under
your
toomer
test
for
privileges
and
immunities
analysis,
valid
independent
reasons
for
the
discrimination.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
i
would
hate
to
express
an
opinion
on
behalf
of
the
attorney
general’s
office
at
this
point
in
time
on
that
issue.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
a
law
such
as
the
one
you
are
proposing?
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
your
toomer
test,
are
there
valid
independent
reasons
for
the
discrimination?
i
could
read
it
to
you.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
yes,
sir.
to
state
it
very
simply,
in
toomer,
you
articulate
a
very
specific
test.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
the
court
articulated
it.[laughter]
it
was
a
two-pronged
issue
and
the
questions
went
as
follows:
are
there
valid
independent
reasons
for
the
disparity
of
treatment?
does
the
degree
of
discrimination
bear
a
close
relation
to
those
reasons?
coupled
with
that
was
a
caveat
added
by
the
court
that
indicated
that
your
inquiry
must
always
be
conducted
with
due
regard
for
the
principle
that
states
should
have
considerable
leeway
in
analyzing
local
evils
and
in
prescribing
appropriate
cures
for
them.
it
is
our
position
that
if
the
court
does
not
apply
the
mccready
principle
to
local
hire,
that
that
test
must
still
be
satisfied.
that
is
the
applicable
test
for
analyzing
local
hire
and
it
is
our
position.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
that
is
right,
the
toomer
test.
i
do
not
consider
it
a
problem.
we
have
addressed
it
in
our
brief.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
yes,
and
that
is
where
the
constitutional
provision
of
the
state
constitution
comes
into
play
which
directs
the
legislature
to
see
to
it
that
land,
which
the
state
owns,
is
utilized
for
the
maximum
benefit
of
residents.
that
constitutional
mandate
applies
only
to
land
which
the
state
owns
and
does
not
apply
to
privately
held
land
by
the
state.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
the
reason
is
that
the
state
owns
this
land
and
desires
to
utilize;
if
it
is
to
be
utilized
at
all,
if
it
is
to
be
disposed
of.
it
desires
to
see
to
it
that
it
would
be
utilized
in
a
manner
which
is
most
beneficial
to
alaska
residents.
you
cannot
apply
that
test
to
private
ownership,
to
land
which
is
privately
owned.
the
state
does
not
have
that
same
interest
in
private
language.
it
has
in
language
it
owns
on
behalf
of
its
people.
i
have
only
a
couple
of
minutes
left.
i
would
just
like
to
address
briefly
the
equal
protection
issues
raised
by
the
appellants
that
this
court
should
find
that
non-residency
is
either
a
suspect
classification
for
purposes
of
equal
protection
analysis
or
that
the
resident-non-resident
discrimination
violates
or
impinges
upon
the
fundamental
right
to
travel,
which
this
court
has
articulated
in
a
number
of
recent
cases.
with
respect
to
the
suspect
classification
argument
we
have
pointed
out
that
this
court
has
never
held
that
non-residency
falls
into
that
suspect
classification
category.
in
fact,
the
underlying
justification
for
suspect
classifications,
which
this
court
has
articulated
in
the
san
antonio
independent
school
district
case
that
suspect
classifications
are
recognized
where
you
are
talking
about
a
group
which
has
no
independent
political
power
base
essentially
simply
does
not
apply
to
non-residents
who
can,
at
any
time,
go
to
their
congressional
leaders
here
in
washington
and
seek
to
get
congress
to
make
discrimination
by
any
state
on
the
basis
of
residence
illegal.
so
that
non-residents
do
in
that
case
have
that
kind
of
a
political
option
which
an
alien
would
not.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
i
beg
your
pardon,
mr.
justice
marshall?
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
i
am
not
going
to
take
that
position,
certainly
not.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
with
respect
to
your
concerns
that
there
are
not
be
great
many
suspect
classifications
created,
the
concerns
which
you
have
articulated
as
justifying
the
creation.
the
recognition
of
suspect
classification
simply
does
not
apply
to
the
situation
of
resident
versus
non-resident
discriminations.
as
to
the
right
of
travel
argument,
this
court
has
recognized
the
right
of
travel
only
in
the
context
of
durational
residency
requirements
where
the
discrimination
is
imposed
between
new
residents
and
old
residents.
the
right
of
travel
which
you
have
discussed
in
those
cases
is
the
right
to
migrate,
the
right
to
actually
pick
up
and
move
one’s
residence
to
one
state
to
another.
this
court
has
yet
to
expand
that
right
to
travel
notion
to
include
the
right
to
travel
casually
throughout
the
united
states.
as
we
have
indicated
in
our
brief
that
we
do
feel
that
there
are,
upon
analyzing
the
cases,
two
different
rights
of
travel
which
this
court
has
recognized.
one
is
the
right
of
migration,
the
right
to
actually
move
one’s
residence
and
take
up
residence
in
a
new
state.
that
is
what
this
court
has
protected
through
its
14th
amendment
analysis.
the
other
right
is
protected
by
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause,
article
4
section
2.with
that,
i
will
close.
thank
you.
