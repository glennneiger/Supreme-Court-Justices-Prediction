we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
hicklin
against
orbeck
and
others.
mr.
wagstaff,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
difference
constitutionally
do
you
see,
if
any,
in
a
statute
such
as
you
have
confine
to
natural
resources
of
alaska
and
all
employment
in
alaska,
independent
of
the
resource,
the
source
of
the
material?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
could
be
expanded
on
that
theory
to
a
salesman
of
toyota
automobiles,
which
as
far
as
i
know,
do
not
draw
any
resources
of
alaska
to
manufacture.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
this
statute
was
sustained
here
and
alaska
had
another
goal
rush,
could
they
extend
the
sweep
of
this
statute
to
gold
mining?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
only
alaskans
could
take
gold
out
or
non-alaskans
only
after
they
had
resided
for
one
year.
would
that
be
the
case
under
the
statute?
the
one
year
was
the
permanent
residence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
lorensen.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
happen
to
have
any
idea
of
how
many
people
in
alaska
are
on
relief?
is
it
a
substantial
number?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
this
time
of
year,
it
is
approximately
12%.
but
people
can
come
from
another
state
and
go
on
relief
immediately
in
alaska,
can
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
consumes
a
natural
resource
of
alaska,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
tax
revenues?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
that
is
a
research
whether
a
natural
or
artificial.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
whatever
the
court
meant
in
toomer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
wagstaff,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
for
us.[laughter]
not
for
others.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
brennan.
