mr.
days
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
the
question
of
whether
all
voting
changes
within
a
state
designated
under
section
4d
of
the
voting
rights
act
in
1965,
must
be
pre-cleared
under
section
5
of
the
same
act.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
these.
in
august
1965,
the
state
of
alabama
was
declared
subject
to
section
4
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
in
march
1975,
the
city
of
sheffield,
alabama
notified
the
attorney
general
that
it
was
submitting
to
its
electorate,
a
referendum
on
the
question
of
whether
it
should
abandon
its
present
three-member
commission
form
of
government
and
return
to
an
old
domain
or
mayor-council
form
like
that
which
governed
sheffield
until
1912.
the
attorney
general
responded
within
the
appropriate
60
day
period,
that
he
would
not
interpose
an
objection
under
section
5
to
the
holding
of
the
referendum,
which
by
that
time
had
already
carried,
but
stated
that
any
voting
changes
made
in
order
to
implement
that
referendum
approving
the
return
to
the
mayor-council
form
would
be
subject
to
pre-clearance.
the
city
of
sheffield
submission
to
the
attorney
general
of
these
proposed
voting
changes
was
completed
in
may
1976.
in
essence,
sheffield
was
prepared
to
go
to
a
system
in
which
a
mayor
and
a
non-member
council
would
govern.
the
city
would
be
divided
in
to
four
wards.
the
mayor
and
council
president
would
be
elected
at-large
without
any
residency
requirements.
the
other
eight
council
members
would
be
elected
at-large
as
well,
two
from
each
ward
under
numbered
post
and
residency
requirements.
in
july
1976,
the
attorney
general
informed
the
city
that
he
would
not
interpose
an
objection
to
the
at-large
system
for
electing
the
mayor
and
council
president,
but
would
object
under
section
5
to
the
arrangance
for
electing
the
eight
council
members.
thereafter
no
declaratory
judgment
was
sought
by
the
city
of
sheffield
before
a
three-judge
court
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
as
provided
by
the
act.
in
august
1976,
this
action
was
commenced
by
the
united
states
to
enjoin
election
scheduled
by
the
city
of
sheffield
pursuant
to
an
arrangement
for
electing
the
eight
council
members
to
which
the
attorney
general
had
objected.
a
temporary
restraining
order
was
denied
by
a
single
judge
court,
and
the
election
was
held
in
december
1976,
a
three-judge
court
dismissed
the
government's
complaint
on
the
grounds
that
the
city
of
sheffield
was
not
a
political
subdivision
as
defined
by
the
act,
because
it
did
not
conduct
registration
for
voting.
therefore,
the
court
held
that
was
not
subject
to
the
pre-clearance
requirements
of
section
5.
it
held
additionally
one
member
dissenting
that
even
if
the
city
of
sheffield
were
a
political
subdivision
under
the
act,
the
attorney
general
await
his
right
to
object
to
specific
elements
of
the
mayor-council
form
of
government,
once
he
indicated
he
had
no
objection
to
the
holding
of
the
referendum
itself.
the
three
-judge
court
was
clearly
correct
in
finding
the
city
of
sheffield
was
not
a
political
subdivision
as
defined
by
the
act.
mr.
days
he
doesn't.
mr.
days
in
some
cases
he
says
there
are
just
no
objections,
in
other
cases
request
is
made
for
additional
information,
in
other
cases,
we
indicate
acting
on
behalf
of
the
attorney
general
that
there
is
not
adequate
information
upon
which
the
attorney
general
can
exercise
his
responsibilities
under
the
voting
rights
act.
in
this
particular
case
having
to
do
with
the
holding
of
a
referendum,
it
is
not
unusual
for
the
attorney
general
to
permit
the
city
to
go
ahead
with
the
referendum
reserving
the
right
to
see
exactly
what
the
impact
of
that
referendum
would
be
on
voting
rights,
if
in
fact
the
referendum
is
carried.
we
respectfully
submit
that
three-judge
court
erred
however
in
concluding
based
upon
its
determination
that
sheffield
was
not
a
political
subdivision
alone
that
the
city
was
not
required
to
submit
voting
changes
under
section
5
for
pre-clearance.
such
a
reading
finds
a
little
support
in
the
language
of
the
statute
itself,
in
its
original
legislative
history,
in
decisions
of
this
court,
in
the
administrative
practice
of
the
attorney
general
and
in
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
extension
of
'65
act
twice
in
1970
and
in
1975.
the
language
of
the
statute
properly
read,
speaks
in
terms
of
geography,
geographic
factors,
not
functional
terms.
section
4b
indicates
that
the
substantive
provisions
of
the
act
shall
apply
in
any
state
which
satisfies
the
provisions
of
4b,
namely
that
it
maintain
a
test
or
device
on
a
date
specified
in
the
act
and
secondly
that
less
than
50
percent
of
its
voting
age
population
was
registered
or
voted
on
the
date
specified
in
the
act.
once
that
is
established
then,
4a
requires
that
no
citizen
shall
be
denied
the
right
to
vote
in
any
federal,
state
or
local
election
because
of
its
failure
to
comply
with
any
test
or
device
in
that
state.
the
preposition
'in'
is
used
in
sections
4a
and
4b
should
reasonably
be
read
to
mean
within
the
geographic
confines
of,
in
the
absence
of
any
evidence
to
the
contrary.
reference
to
local
as
well
as
federal
and
state
elections
reflects
the
reach
of
the
acts,
provisions
to
all
public
elections
held
within
a
state,
not
just
those
conducted
under
direct
state
supervision.
moreover
the
language
of
section
4a
which
describes
how
a
state
is
covered
under
the
terms
of
4b
may
terminate
such
coverage
requires
the
state
to
show
that
for
an
expressed
period
of
time
no
denials
or
abridgments
of
the
right
to
vote
on
account
of
race
or
color
through
the
use
of
such
tests
or
devices
have
occurred
anywhere
in
its
territory.
the
word
'territory'
is
not
defined
in
the
act
but
it
is
commonly
regarded
as
a
geographic
and
not
a
functional
term.
where
a
state
meets
the
first
requirement
of
section
4b
namely,
it
maintained
a
tested
device
but
does
not
satisfy
the
second,
the
entire
state
may
not
be
subject
to
the
provisions
of
4a.
under
such
circumstances
the
act
reveals
that
a
political
subdivision
of
that
state
may
be
covered,
however,
as
a
separate
unit.
the
use
of
this
disjunctive
phrase
in
any
state
or
in
any
political
subdivision
of
a
state
in
4b
dictates
such
a
reading.
it
is
at
this
point
that
the
definition
of
this
separate
unit,
the
political
subdivision
become
pertinent.
for
only
one
in
which
less
than
50
percent
of
the
voting
age
population
has
registered
or
voted
on
the
specified
date
can
be
designated.
section
14(c)(2)
defines
the
political
subdivision
as
any
county
or
parish
except
that
where
registration
for
voting
is
not
conduced
under
the
supervision
of
a
county
or
parish.
the
term
shall
include
any
other
subdivision
of
the
state
which
conducts
registration
for
voting.
thus,
a
county
or
parish
or
any
other
entity
that
supervises
the
conducting
of
elections
which
does
not
meet
the
less
that
50
percent
of
the
voting
age
population
provision
cannot
qualify
as
a
political
subdivision
for
purposes
of
the
act.
mr.
days
we
do
concede,
it
is
not
a
political
subdivision
under
the
act.
but
we
submit
that
the
term
political
subdivision
has
no
operative
significance
under
the
act
unless
it
is
tied
to
the
percentage
triggering
mechanism
of
4b.
as
this
court
has
recognized,
congress
intended
through
the
enactment
of
the
voting
rights
act
to
rid
the
country
of
racial
discrimination
in
voting.
the
act
itself
was
designed
not
only
to
end
discriminatory
practices
which
congress
had
found,
denied
or
abridged
the
right
of
citizens
to
vote
on
account
of
race
or
color
but
also
to
reach
new
practices
in
the
future
that
might
have
similar
purpose
or
effect.
congress
was
urged
about
the
department
of
justice
to
enact
the
1965
legislation
because
it
had
concluded
that
powers
given
to
it
under
earlier
statues
to
enforce
the
fifteenth
amendment
on
a
case
by
case
basis
had
proven
ineffective.
this
ineffectiveness
had
stemmed
largely
from
the
persistent
creation
of
new
stratagems
to
perpetuate
racial
discrimination
in
voting
as
soon
as
present
tactics
were
outlawed.
in
response,
congress
marshaled
an
array
of
potent
weapons
against
this
evil
with
authority
and
the
attorney
general
to
employ
them
effectively.
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
1965
act
to
support
the
view
that
when
a
state
was
brought
within
its
provisions,
congress
intended
to
include
certain
types
of
voting
changes
within
that
state
from
pre-clearance
while
excluding
others.
the
reach
was
clearly
designed
to
be
geographic
and
to
affect
actions
of
the
state.
state
being
defined
traditionally
under
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments
to
include
any
instrument
of
the
states
such
as
cities
or
other
governmental
bodies.
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
also
makes
clear
that
the
term
political
subdivision
was
defined
in
14(c)(2)
for
very
practical
reasons.
in
those
situations
where
an
entire
state
was
not
covered
under
4b
the
only
smaller
geographic
area
for
which
the
director
of
census
could
make
a
determination
under
the
formulation
of
4(b)(2)
as
to
the
percentage
of
voting
age
population
that
was
registered
in
voting
in
the
1965
presidential
election
was
the
county
or
parish.
although,
congress
has
never
explicitly
addressed
the
issue
presented
in
this
appeal,
congress
extended
the
voting
rights
act
in
1970
and
1975
under
circumstances
that
justify
the
conclusion
that
it
understood
the
pre-clearance
provisions
of
section
5
of
the
act
to
apply
to
all
voting
changes
occurring
within
a
state
or
political
subdivision
designated
under
section
4b.
at
first,
congress
was
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
attorney
general,
the
federal
official,
charged
with
responsibility
for
administering
the
act
had
consistently
interpreted
it
to
require
pre-clearance
of
all
coting
changes
within
covered
states
of
political
subdivisions
irrespective
of
whether
the
submitting
authority
supervised
the
conduct
of
registration
for
voting.
during
consideration
of
the
1970
extension
the
failure
of
the
city
if
anniston,
alabama
in
1968
to
obtain
pre-clearance
of
a
change
in
its
electoral
system
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
congress
as
an
example
of
why
extension
of
the
act
was
required.
anniston,
like
sheffield,
does
not
conduct
registration
for
voting.
mr.
days
it
is
not
clear
that
congress
focused
on
that
particular
issue
to
determine
whether
the
reach
was
going
to
be
down
below
the
county
or
parish
level
but
we
think
that
the
environment
does
indicate
that
congress
understood
what
the
reach
would
be.
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
specifically
indicates
that
congress
was
concerned
with
the
city
or
school
board
level
of
elections.
in
1975,
my
predecessor
j.
stanley
prodinger(ph)
testifying
in
favor
or
further
extension
of
the
voting
rights
act
informed
congress
that
section
5
objections
had
been
lodged
against
the
cities
of
birmingham,
talladega,
mobile,
and
alabama
between
1970
and
1973
as
well
as
against
cities
and
a
number
of
other
states.
between
august
6,
1965
and
may
1,
1977
the
attorney
general
has
received
more
than
8,000
proposed
changes
by
non-voter
registering
political
units
within
--
mr.
days
yes.
mr.
days
well,
the
interpretation
that
we
urge
upon
the
court
is
that
once
a
state
is
covered
then
all
political
units
--
mr.
days
well
i
think
it
says
that
--
mr.
days
i
do
not
but
the
interpretation
--
mr.
days
well,
i
think
that
the
interpretation
of
the
term
state
as
reaching
to
all
governmental
units
that
are
creatures
of
the
state
is
how
that
should
be
interpreted.
we
are
not
particularly
concerned
whether
a
city
actually
does
the
submitting,
but
the
state
actually
--
mr.
days
if
a
state
is
--
mr.
days
that
is
exactly
a
correct
term.
mr.
days
i
think
its
meaning
is
tied
to
the
triggering
mechanism
under
4(b)(2).
in
other
words,
the
act
is
not
designed
to
cover
every
political
subdivision,
it
covers
only
political
subdivisions
within
those
states
that
had
testing
devices,
and
which
meet
the
50
percent
or
below
50
percent
triggering
mechanism.
one
cannot
understand
the
use
of
the
phrase
political
subdivision,
in
4a
for
example,
merely
by
looking
at
14(c)(2),
one
has
to
look
to
4(b)(2)
and
that
triggering
mechanism
to
understand
what
it
means.
if
one
were
to
look
at
14(c)(2)
alone,
and
then
look
at
4a,
the
conclusion
that
one
would
have
to
reach
is
that
any
county
or
parish
that
conducted
registration
would
be
covered
by
the
act,
even
though
it
did
not
meet
the
below
50
percent
triggering
mechanism.
in
other
words
14(c)(2)
is
defined
in
part
by
the
triggering
mechanism
of
4(b)(2).
mr.
days
that
is
correct.
the
three-judge
court
itself
recognized
that
once
a
state
was
covered
every
political
subdivision
within
the
state
would
be
covered
as
well.
of
course,
under
those
circumstances,
counties
within
the
state
of
alabama,
would
not
be
specifically
designated.
they
would
come
in
along
with
the
state
designation.
it
makes
little
sense
we
submit,
to
suggest
that
subdivisions
below
the
county
or
parish
would
not
also
be
brought
in
under
that
logic.
i
might
say
that
over
700
of
such
changes
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
from
alabama,
under
section
5
have
come
from
non
registering
units
within
that
state
such
as
cities.
the
second
thing
that
congress
was
aware
of
was
the
fact
that
this
court
had
construed
section
5
to
reach
voting
changes
in
covered
states,
a
political
subdivision
that
altered
the
election
law
in
even
a
minor
way.
even
where
such
changes
did
not
relate
directly
to
the
registration
process
itself.
this
court's
decisions
in
allen
were
specifically
mentioned
in
the
testimony
in
legislative
history
of
the
1970
extension,
and
the
perkin's
decision
was
much
discussed
during
proceedings
leading
after
the
1975
extension,
particularly
as
it
related
to
ending
voting
discrimination
in
texas
city.
moreover
congress
was
aware
that
the
attorney
general
had
adopted
a
reading
of
section
5
consistent
with
this
court's
rulings
in
allen
and
perkins
to
reach
changes
involving
redistricting,
annexations,
relocation
of
polling
places
and
of
election
laws
relating
to
numbered
posts,
staggered
terms
and
candidate
filing
fees,
at
the
state
county
and
city
level.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
fact
as
i
have
described
demonstrate
that
the
interpretation
given
section
5
by
the
three-judge
court
exempting
certain
voting
changes
within
states
designated
under
section
4b
from
pre-clearance
requirements,
depending
on
whether
they
supervise
the
conducting
of
registration
for
voting
is
erroneous,
and
should
be
reversed.
over
half
of
the
submissions
to
the
attorney
general
since
1965
have
been
from
non
registering
governmental
units.
the
intent
of
congress
to
subject
to
section
5
pre-clearance
voting
changes
of
governmental
units
that
did
not
conduct
registrations,
most
clearly
seen
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
1975
extension.
for
there,
the
major
focus
of
the
testimony
and
debate
over
extending
coverage
to
the
state
of
texas,
was
that
it
would
serve
to
check
changes,
to
at-large
majority
runoff
systems
by
cities
and
school
boards,
governmental
entities
that
do
not
conduct
registration
in
the
state
of
texas.
if
the
court
below
is
correct,
then
congress
which
enacted
the
voting
rights
act
in
1965
and
extended
it
twice,
thinking
that
its
provisions
would
eradicate
the
insidious
and
pervasive
evil
of
discrimination
in
voting,
divide
the
solution
that
missed
the
mark
by
half.
your
honor,
at
this
time
i
would
like
to
reserve
additional
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
days
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
just
a
few
comments.
counsel
was
asked
whether
sheffield
doubted
its
coverage
under
section
5.
i
believe
page
14
of
the
appendix,
which
contains
march
20th
letter
indicates
that
sheffield
did
not
consider
itself
excluded
from
section
5
coverage,
there
was
merely
some
question
about
whether
that
specific
change
was
subject
to
section
5.
page
14
of
the
appendix.
the
first
time,
a
specific
issue
raised
here
was
presented
to
the
court,
was
in
the
post
trial
brief
of
the
city
of
sheffield.
mr.
days
well,
i
would
concede
that
there
is
some
intimation
but
i
think
that
read
more
exactly,
it
refers
to
not
whether
the
city
itself
is
covered
but
whether
this
particular
change
is
coveted
under
section
5
and
requires
pre-clearance.
mr.
days
now,
in
so
far
as
the
force
of
alabama
law
is
concerned,
once
a
referendum
of
this
kind
takes
place,
i
submit
that
the
record
reflects
that
there
was
a
great
deal
of
confusion
as
to
exactly
how
alabama
law
would
come
in
to
play
in
this
case.
the
city
itself
said,
it
was
returning
to
the
form
of
government
in
existence
in
1912,
an
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
of
alabama
in
1968
seemed
to
indicate
that
a
return
to
that
form
would
require
election
by
districts
and
not
at-large.
the
attorney
general's
opinion
is
in
the
appendix
at
page
54
and
therefore
there
was
some
we
submit,
reasonable
doubt
as
to
how
the
alabama
law
would
apply
whether
the
law
enforcing
1976
would
have
any
forcing
effect
at
all.
in
so
far
is
how
far
down
section
5
provisions
reach,
we
think
that
there
is
some
guidance
on
the
counsel's
example
of
university
of
alabama
elections.
first
of
all,
this
court
has
spoken
in
such
cases
as
terry
v.
adams
about
elections
at
which
public
issues
are
decided
but
that's
what
the
fifteenth
amendment
is
designed
to
reach.
secondly
on
page
26th
of
our
brief,
we
quote
a
statement
by
attorney
general
katzenbach
in
which
he
responds
to
a
question,
would
it
cover
an
election
for
a
school
board
and
he
responded,
yes
it
would
mr.
chairman.
every
election
in
which
registered
electors
are
permitted
to
vote
would
be
covered
by
this
bill
and
finally
the
act
itself
in
section
14(b)(1)
provides
some
guidance
as
to
its
reach,
because
it
talks
about
elections
such
as
primary,
special
or
general
elections
and
talks
about
candidates
for
public
or
party
office
and
propositions
for
which
votes
are
received
in
a
election.
we
submit
that
all
these
definitions
give
a
fairly
clear
sense
of
the
scope
of
the
section
5,
in
so
far
as
elections
are
concerned.
thank
you
very
much.
