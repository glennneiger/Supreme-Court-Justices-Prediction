justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
clear,
mr.
days,
form
that
colloque
that
the
part
of
the
legislative
history
you
are
relying
on
that
congress
focused
on
whether
or
not
the
particular
subdivision
conducted
registration
for
voting.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
take
it
a
political
subdivision
can
be
covered
even
of
the
state
in
which
it
exists,
it
is
not.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
he
says
that
in
effect
once
a
state
is
covered
you
look
to
the
nature
of
the
change
rather
than
to
the
type
of
political
unit
its
making.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
all
kinds
of
change,
i
suppose
that
has
been
decided
in
the
previous
cases
in
this
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
second
paragraph
of
that
letter
on
page
14,
general
days,
where
it
says,
of
the
appendix,
it
is
doubtful
that
this
proposition
is
to
change
the
forms
of
municipal
government
is
covered
by
the
1965
voting
rights
act.
don't
you
think
there
is
some
intimation
in
that
language
of
the
position
now
taken
by
the
appellee
here.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
what
it
says.
