mr.
vincent
mcalister
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
speak
tonight
for
the
dignity
of
men
and
the
destiny
of
democracy.
i
urge
every
member
of
both
parties,
americans
of
all
religions
and
all
colors
from
every
section
of
the
country
to
join
me
in
that
cause.
at
times
history
and
fate
meet
at
a
single
time
in
a
single
place,
to
shape
a
turning
point
in
the
man's
unending
search
for
freedom.
so
it
was
at
lexington
and
concord,
so
it
was
a
century
ago
at
appomattox,
so
it
was
last
week
at
selma,
alabama.
from
that
lofty
and
noble
beginning
by
president
johnson
in
march
of
1965,
the
voting
rights
act
was
presented
to
a
joint
session
of
congress.
today
twelve-and-a-half
years
later,
i
appear
before
you
representing
the
city
of
sheffield,
alabama
in
a
suit
which
we
think
is
out
of
the
shadows
and
perversion
of
that
great
act.
sheffield
alabama
is
a
city
of
13,000
people
relocated
in
north-west
alabama.
about
20
miles,
equal
distant
from
mississippi
and
tennessee.
we
are
on
the
banks
of
the
tennessee
river,
40
miles
upstream
from
shallow
landing.
a
part
of
the
muscle
shows
and
tennessee
valley
authority
area.
our
town
began
in
1885
with
a
mayor-council
form
of
government,
which
we
retained
until
1912,
when
we
changed
to
a
commission
form
of
government.
the
commission
formed
remained
in
force
from
1912
until
1975,
when
as
a
result
of
a
special
referendum,
the
citizens
elected
to
revert
back
to
the
mayor-council
form.
the
laws
of
the
state
of
alabama
governed
the
creation,
organization
and
function
of
cities
in
the
state.
the
law
requires
that
in
cities
of
sheffield's
population
that
cities
holding
a
mayor-council
form
of
government
that
the
councilmen
be
elected
at-large
and
reside
within
the
wards
established.
the
change
in
the
form
of
government
in
sheffield
in
1975
was
precipitated
by
voter
apathy
in
the
commission
form,
a
desire
to
have
a
full
time
mayor
and
the
hope
for
more
citizen
involvement
in
local
government.
in
march
of
1975,
prior
to
the
referendum,
the
mayor
of
the
city
of
sheffield
wrote
the
attorney
general
advising
of
the
proposed
referendum,
and
the
attorney
general
replied
that
he
did
not
interpose
any
objection
to
the
referendum.
let
me
stop
at
this
point
to
emphasize
that
under
alabama
law,
once
you
elect
through
a
referendum
and
the
citizens
vote
in
the
referendum
to
change
the
form
of
government.
that
sets
in
motion
a
chain
of
events
that
cannot
be
stopped
by
the
will
or
choice
of
any
elected
officials
in
the
city.
the
city
must
then
prepare
for
the
change
from
the
commission
to
the
mayor-council
that
involves
qualifications
of
candidates,
setting
of
election
dates,
establishing
of
the
wards.
mr.
vincent
mcalister
well,
the
mayor
wrote
that
letter.
mr.
vincent
mcalister
well,
he
thought
that
possibly
it
was
covered.
mr.
vincent
mcalister
in
his
communication,
he
expressed,
he
said,
?i
don't
think
that
we
are
covered.
i
don't
know,
i
am
just
writing
you
out
of
an
abundance
of
precaution
in
essence?.
and
we
say
that
at
particular
point,
if
the
attorney
general
had
an
objection,
he
knew
what
the
laws
of
alabama
were
as
well
as
we
did
and
he
knew
that
once
the
citizens
voted
to
have
a
mayor-council
form,
that
we
were
bound
under
state
law
to
have
our
election
at-large.
in
other
words,
the
candidates
were
to
run
at-large,
that's
what
the
alabama
law
requires.
mr.
vincent
mcalister
yes
sir,
i
am.
mr.
vincent
mcalister
that
is
correct.
so
we
think
that
at
that
point
if
he
had
an
objection
to
what
we
were
doing,
the
time
to
object
should
have
been
right
then.
but
to
wait
over
a
year
later
and
come
in
and
say,
we
approve
everything
else
you
have
done
but
we
do
not
approve
of
your
electing
your
candidates
at-large.
we
think
that
would
ridicule
us.
let
us
object
to
that
at
the
beginning,
if
that
is
what
you
are
objecting
to.
mr.
vincent
mcalister
yes
sir.
mr.
vincent
mcalister
yes
sir.
mr.
vincent
mcalister
no
sir.
further
the
attorney
general
seeks
to
young
polls
what
we
think
is
his
will
on
the
city
of
sheffield
through
the
force
and
power
of
the
federal
government
without
any
basis
of
law.
there
is
a
dangerous
equation
in
this
case
to
the
way
the
attorney
general
thinks
with
the
law.
at
the
risk
of
being
elementary,
i
would
remind
the
attorney
general
that
it
was
out
of
that
same
lexington
and
concord,
that
president
johnson
referred
to
in
1965,
that
produced
these
words.
in
the
government
of
the
common
wealth
of
massachusetts,
the
legislative
executive
and
judicial
power
shall
be
placed
in
separate
departments.
"to
the
end
that
it
might
be
a
government
of
laws
and
not
of
men.?
the
voting
rights
act
does
not
apply
to
sheffield.
it
does
not
require
any
strange
semantics
or
legal
gymnastics
to
make
it
apply.
the
act
applies
only
to
a
state
or
a
political
subdivision
that
denies
or
abridges
the
right
of
a
citizen
to
vote
on
the
account
of
race
or
color.
a
political
subdivision
is
defined
in
the
act,
and
everybody
admits
that
sheffield
does
not
fall
within
that
definition.
mr.
vincent
mcalister
no,
sir.
mr.
vincent
mcalister
no
city
in
alabama
registers
voters.
mr.
vincent
mcalister
i
talked
to
the
solicitor
general
just
as
that.
mr.
vincent
mcalister
he
said
that
no
city
in
alabama
registers
voters
and
is
not
a
political
subdivision
within
the
definition
of
the
act.
mr.
vincent
mcalister
i
do
not
think
so
that
is
the
issue.
mr.
vincent
mcalister
his
position
is
that
every
political
unit
in
a
state
is
within
the
act.
mr.
vincent
mcalister
yes
sir.
wish
he
does
not
state
what
a
political
unit
is
either.
mr.
vincent
mcalister
but
what
kind
of
change.
mr.
vincent
mcalister
i
mean
what
kind
of
political
unit?
in
other
words,
in
a
state
or
in
a
local,
community,
you
might
have
that
in
agricultural
stabilization
committee
or
a
water
drainage
district.
in
our
area
we
have
a
water
district
that
might
take
in
two
or
three
square
miles
or
20
square
miles.
i
will
point
out
kind
of
a
ridiculous
example,
in
my
brief,
how
about
a
school
election
at
a
university,
the
university
of
alabama.
is
that
a
political
unit.
we
do
not
know.
mr.
vincent
mcalister
the
university
of
alabama,
no
sir.
mr.
vincent
mcalister
no
sir,
i
do
not
know
what
is
the
definition?
mr.
vincent
mcalister
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
vincent
mcalister
yes
sir.
we
say
that
the
act
does
not
purport
to
apply
to
a
city
that
does
not
register
voters.
and
again
we
point
out
that
the
aim
of
the
1965
act,
was
to
register
voters.
and
again
referring
to
president
johnson's
speech,
he
says,
?if
the
bill
will
provide
for
citizens
to
be
registered
by
officials
of
the
united
states
government,
if
the
state
officials
refuse
to
register
them?.
the
bill
was
introduced
in
the
congress
in
1965,
the
following
date,
if
we
recall
that
president
johnson
made
his
speech.
mr.
katzenbach,
the
then
attorney
general
appeared
before
the
congress
and
explained
the
voting
rights
act
to
the
committee
that
was
handling
the
bill.
he
testified
it
linked,
and
i
have
quoted
in
my
brief
from
his
testimony,
before
that
committee.
mr.
katzenbach
had
no
doubt
in
his
mind
how
voter
registration
was
conducted
in
the
state
of
alabama.
he
stated
that
he
knew
how
it
was
conducted
in
the
state
of
alabama.
we
state
this
to
the
court,
how
can
a
piece
of
legislation
like
the
voting
rights
act
that
was
aimed
at
a
particular
state,
alabama,
aimed
by
the
president
of
united
states
that
triggered
his
speech,
selma,
alabama,
aimed
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states,
mr.
katzenbach
said,
he
knew
how
voters
were
registered
in
alabama.
and
aimed
by
the
congress,
why
do
we
at
this
point,
have
to
end
up
according
to
the
argument
of
the
solicitor
general,
look
in
to
some
type
of
ambiguity
in
the
act
to
come
forth
with
the
way
the
attorney
general
has
construed
the
act,
and
the
subsequent
re-enactments
of
the
act
by
the
congress,
it
just
does
not
make
sense
to
us,
that
an
act
aimed
at
theory
may
protect
a
wrong,
could
end
up
to
be
so
ambiguous.
we
say
its
not
ambiguous,
we
say
its
clear,
we
say
that
the
construction
that
the
attorney
general
seeks
to
place
on
the
act
is
clearly
erroneous.
the
only
justification
for
his
argument
and
he
makes
it
in
the
brief,
is
that
we
need
uniformity
in
the
application
of
this
act.
also,
he
says
that
the
case
by
case
process
of
solving
voter
problems
is
inefficient.
we
would
answer
that
this
way.
oliver
flint(ph),
the
black
councilmen
is
alabama,
sheffield,
that
was
elected
in
this
at-large
election,
he
does
not
appreciate
the
uniformity
argument
at
all.
and
he
would
prefer
the
case
by
case
method
because
he
would
be
assured
under
that
method
of
retaining
his
seat
on
the
council.
also
we
state
that
the
argument
of
the
attorney
general
fails
completely
under
scrutiny.
section
4
of
the
act
upon
which
section
5
depends
deals
exclusively
with
states
and
political
subdivisions
that
use
discriminatory
tests
or
devices
to
deny
persons
the
right
to
vote
you
must
be
a
voter
registering
state
or
political
subdivision
to
have
a
test
or
device.
mr.
vincent
mcalister
well
it
says
in
4
that
the
triggering
feature
in
4
is
a
state
or
political
subdivision
that
has
test
or
device.
ordinarily,
the
state
legislature
would
have
provided
for
the
so
called
test
or
devices
that
were
struck
down.
mr.
vincent
mcalister
yes
sir.
mr.
vincent
mcalister
yes
sir.
we
also
state
that
under
the
act,
i
mean,
using
our
logic
it
is
completely
sensible
to
apply
it
that
way
under
section
5
of
the
act
that
you
recall,
there
is
a
procedure
for
declaratory
judgment
in
the
district
court
of
washington
d.c,
by
a
state
or
a
political
subdivision
and
i
think,
we
could
go
into
the
district
court
of
washington
d.c
and
get
dismissed
because
we
are
not
a
political
subdivision
and
we
can
not
get
that
declaratory
judgment.
mr.
vincent
mcalister
the
court
might
own
its
own
motion.
further,
our
third
point
about
the
argument
of
the
attorney
general
is
we
think
it
leads
to
absurd
applications
and
i
mentioned
that
before,
he
says
political
units
and
we
say
to
apply
this
act
or
seek
to
apply
to
school
elections
and
water
districts,
drainage
districts,
agricultural
committees
and
others
is
a
perversion
of
a
good
act.
in
conclusion,
we
say
that
the
city
of
sheffield
is
not
covered
by
the
voting
rights
act
and
that
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you,
sir.
