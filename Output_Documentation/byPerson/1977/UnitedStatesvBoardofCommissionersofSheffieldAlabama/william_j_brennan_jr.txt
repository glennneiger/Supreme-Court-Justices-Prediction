justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
case
arises
under
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
the
state
of
alabama
is
covered
under
that
act
as
it's
twice
been
extended
in
1970
and
1975.
alabama
must,
therefore,
obtain
prior
federal
approval
before
changing
any
voting
practice
or
procedure
that
was
in
effect
on
november
1,
1964.
in
this
case,
however,
a
three-judge
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
alabama,
held
that
this
requirement
of
federal
approval
was
not
applicable
as
respects
a
change
by
the
city
of
sheffield,
alabama
where
mayor-council
form
of
government.
the
district
court
held
that
the
sheffield
was
not
within
the
state's
coverage
under
section
5,
even
though
sheffield
is
a
subdivision
of
alabama,
because
sheffield
was
not
a
subdivision
which
conducts
registration
for
voting.
we
disagree.
we
hold
that
section
5
of
the
act
covers
all
political
units
within
designated
jurisdictions
like
alabama.
mr.
justice
blackmun,
joining
the
court
opinion,
has
also
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
mr.
justice
powell
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
mr.
justice
stevens
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
dissents
and
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
