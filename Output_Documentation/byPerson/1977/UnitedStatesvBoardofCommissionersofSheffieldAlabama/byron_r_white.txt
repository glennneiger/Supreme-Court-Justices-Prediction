you
concede,
i
take
it,
mr.
days
that
sheffield,
alabama
does
not
fall
under
that
statutory
definition
of
political
subdivision.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
days
what
do
you
--
what
is
a
local
subdivision
which
is
not
a
political
subdivision
as
defined
by
the
act.
it
isn't
the
political
subdivision
but
is
it
the
state?
well,
section
5
says
that
whenever
a
state
or
a
political
subdivision
makes
a
change
it
is
supposed
to
submit
--
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
if
it
is
neither
one
of
those
well
why
is
it
required
to
submit
or
how
does
it
even
get
to
the
attorney
general?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
once
covered
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
it
could
be
that
it
is
covered
for
the
purposes
of
earlier
--
because
of
section
4,
but
it
might
not
--
there
might
be
a
clearance
procedure
there
going
to
court.
but
in
this
section
5
it
says
that
whenever
a
state
of
political
subdivision
makes
a
change
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
do
not
say
the
subdivision
as
a
state
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
do
you
?
how
does
section
5
apply
to
non-political
subdivision,
unless
it
is
the
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
for
purposes
of
section
5
then
the
political
subdivision
is
just
irrelevant
i
think.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
a
state
has
been
covered.
