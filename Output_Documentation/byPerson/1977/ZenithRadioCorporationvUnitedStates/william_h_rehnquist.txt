justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
ikenson,
what
is
the
role
of
the
administrative
practice
in
a
case
such
as
this?
is
there
latitude
for
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
as
the
statute
is
presently
drawn
to
decide
one
way
or
the
other
and
be
affirmed
by
the
courts
in
either
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
not
allow
for
any
situations
where
the
secretary
in
a
close
case
might
decide
something
was
or
was
not
a
bounty
or
grant
and
say
that
his
determination
should
be
affirmed
by
the
customs
court
in
either
event
or
do
you
say
flatly,
?no,?
that
it
goes
either
one
way
or
the
other
depending
on
how
the
court
decides?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
every
eight
years
in
the
case
of
the
labor
board?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
mccree
do
you
not
think
that
the
words
directly
or
indirectly
in
the
statue
that
we
are
presently
dealing
might
expend
that
view
of
the
word
bounty?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
mccree
you
agree
with
your
opponent
as
to
the
allocation
of
function
between
the
secretary,
the
customs
code
and
the
ccpa
that
he
stated
yesterday?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
standard
does
the
customs
code
use
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
secretary
properly
determined
that
something
was
a
direct
or
indirect
bounty?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
concede
in
your
brief,
do
you
not
and
i
take
it
here
too
that
gatt
does
not
supersede
an
act
of
congress?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
mccree
by
your
presumption
all
the
whole
miranda
opinion
is
dicta
because
it
addressed
a
number
of
subjects
that
were
not
before
the
court
at
all.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
could
be
challenged
only
by
the
foreign
party
upon
whom
the
duty
was
imposed
rather
than
by
any
domestics
competitor?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
importer,
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
has
been
our
practice
to
give
much
attention
to
committee
reports
of
bills
that
never
were
passed?
