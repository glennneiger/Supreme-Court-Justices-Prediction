but

not
also
true
that
the
customs
court
did
not
even
have
an
index
of
its
opinions
until
the
1940’s?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
you
say
that
they
have
given
this
a
careful
attention,
but
they
were
indexed
for
the
first
time
in
the
1940’s,
were
they
not,
the
customs
court,
judge
richardson
did
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
it
true
before
1940?
justice
thurgood

a
very
hard
time
of
doing
research
without
an
index?(inaudible)
justice

this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
customs
and
patents
appeals.
it
involves
a
question
of
statutory
construction
that
has
important
implications
for
this
country's
foreign
trade.
the
statute
in
question
is
section
303
of
the
tariff
act
of
1930
as
amended,
the
so
called
countervailing
duty
statute
was
first
enacted
as
part
of
the
tariff
act
of
1897.
the
statute
provides
that
when
a
foreign
country
pays
a
"bounty
or
grant"
on
exports,
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
is
required
to
levy
a
countervailing
duty
equal
to
the
"bounty
or
grant"
upon
importation
if
those
products
into
the
united
states.
the
specific
issue
here
is
whether
japan
confers
a
"bounty
or
grant"
by
imposing
a
commodity
tax
on
certain
products
when
they
are
sold
in
japan,
but
not
when
they
are
exported.
following
the
long
standing
position
of
the
treasury
department,
dating
back
to
1898,
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
concluded
that
the
exemption
of
export
from
such
a
tax
is
not
a
"bounty
or
grant"
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
petitioner,
an
american
manufacturer
of
consumer
electronic
products
sought
judicial
review,
claiming
that
the
secretary's
position
was
inconsistent
with
this
court's
1903
decision
in
downs
versus
united
states.
the
customs
court
ruled
in
favor
of
petitioner,
ordered
the
secretary
to
assess
countervailing
duties
on
the
japanese
products.
on
appeal
by
the
government,
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
reversed.
it
distinguished
our
decision
in
downs
and
concluded
that
exemption
of
exports
from
an
indirect
tax
is
not
a
"bounty
of
grant."
by
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
unanimously
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals.
the
department's
out
--
long
standing
interpretation
of
the
statute
adopted
less
than
a
year
after
enactment
of
that
statute
is
entitled
to
considerable
weight.
on
the
other
hand
our
examination
of
the
language,
the
legislative
history
and
the
overall
purpose
of
an
1897
law
persuades
us
that
the
department's
initial
construction
of
the
statute
was
far
from
unreasonable.
nothing
in
the
subsequent
events
makes
that
interpretation
any
less
permissible
today.
the
decision
in
downs
is
not
controlling
on
the
issue
of
whether
forgiveness
of
taxes
standing
alone,
constitutes
an
export
bounty.
congress
has
not
acted
to
overturn
the
department's
interpretation
and
it
has
now
been
incorporated
into
the
general
agreement
on
tariffs
and
trade
which
is
followed
by
every
major
importing
nation
in
the
world.
in
this
situation
it
is
not
the
task
of
the
judiciary
to
substitute
its
views
for
those
of
the
secretary.
we
therefore
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
