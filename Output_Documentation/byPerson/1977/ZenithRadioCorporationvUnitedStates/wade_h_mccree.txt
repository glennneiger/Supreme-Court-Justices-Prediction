mr.
wade
h.
mccree
i
would
prefer
to
begin
in
the
morning.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
thank
you.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court.
the
question
presented
in
this
appeal
is
whether
the
remission
of
the
japanese
commodity
tax
which
is
imposed
on
certain
consumer
electronics
products
only
if
they
are
sold
on
japan
is
a
bounty
or
grant
with
in
the
meaning
of
the
tariff
act
of
1930.
when
the
congress
required
the
imposition
of
a
countervailing
duty
in
addition
to
any
duties
otherwise
imposed
whenever
a
bounty
or
grant
was
payed
or
bestowed
upon
the
manufacture
or
production
or
export
of
an
article
imported
into
unite
states,
it
did
not
define
the
words
bounty
or
a
grant.
and
it
then
became
the
duty
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
not
only
to
compute
the
net
amount
of
a
countervailing
duty
that
might
be
due,
but
also
and
initially
to
determine
whether
the
triggering
event,
the
bounty
had
occurred.
since
a
variety
of
government
activities
could
properly
be
regarded
as
bestowing
the
a
bounty
or
grant,
for
example
a
favorable
property
tax
rate
or
perhaps
the
exemption
from
a
property
tax
all
together,
the
secretary
required
some
guidance
in
defining
this
words.
as
we
have
set
forth
on
pages
19
to
24
of
our
brief,
the
secretary
was
not
without
direction
from
the
congress.
in
the
evolution
of
statutory
language
and
in
the
explanation
of
the
congressional
debates,
it
became
evidence
the
congress
did
not
regard
the
non
excessive
remission
of
an
excise
tax
as
bounty
or
grant
and
we
define
non
excessive
to
mean
a
forgiveness
of
the
tax
not
in
excess
of
what
was
actually
paid.
in
that
portion
of
our
brief
we
point
out
that
as
early
as
1890
in
the
sugar
tariff,
we
find
the
earliest
use
of
the
word
bounty
in
the
context
of
the
encouragement
of
an
export.
the
record
on
debate
indicates
what
congress
understood
then
by
its
use
bounty
and
this
was
the
remission
or
drawback
of
indirect
taxes
exceeding
the
taxes
the
exporters
had
paid
on
the
goods.
by
leave
of
court,
i
would
like
to
read
one
sentence
from
the
remarks
of
the
senator
gibson
in
the
congressional
debate
on
that
act
and
this
is
found
at
page
21
of
the
government's
brief
and
senator
gibson
after
giving
an
example
said,
“but
upon
the
export
of
a
ton
of
sugar
he
receive
back
as
a
drawback
$117.60
making
a
clear
bounty
of
$20.54
per
gross
ton
of
sugar
imported.
this
follows
the
statement
that
only
$97.06
per
gross
ton
was
paid.
so
it’s
clear
from
that
example
that
it
was
the
$20.54
excess
over
the
tax
paid
by
the
exporter
that
was
regarded
as
a
bounty.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
they
might
be
so
regarded
except
in
1890,
in
the
first
sugar
act,
the
language
was
used
directly
or
indirectly
was
also
employed
at
the
time
senator
gibson
gave
us
this
as
example
which
would
indicate
that
it
was
understood
then
just
to
indicate
the
excessive
remission.
it
was
not
added
subsequently.
on
page
20
of
our
brief
we
set
forth
about
half
way
the-down
the
page,
the
language
of
the
1890
statue
and
in
the
2nd
or
3rd
line
from
the
bottom
of
the
coded
language,
we
show
that
directly
or
indirectly
it
was
found
initially
when
bounty
was
first
employed.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
it
was
my
first
acquaintance
with
it
too
if
the
court
please
and
it
is
used
as
i
understand
it,
synonymously
with,
it
means
a
pay
back,
a
remission,
maybe
an
exemption
from
the
tax.
a
drawback
is
a
return
of
the
amount
paid
and
it
has
been
used
consistently
to
mean
a
non
excessive
drawback
unless
it
indicates
otherwise.
after
that
first
sugar
tariff
act
in
1890,
in
1894
as
we
point
out
on
pages
21
and
22
of
our
brief,
a
proviso
was
added
to
the
sugar
tariff
that
makes
clear
that
a
non
excessive
remission
does
not
require
a
countervailing
duty.
that
proviso
was
found
at
the
bottom
of
page
21
and
it
provides
that
the
importer
of
sugar
produced
in
the
foreign
country,
the
government
of
which
grants
such
direct
or
indirect
bounty
maybe
relieved
from
this
additional
duty
which
was
a
countervailing
duty,
in
case
said
importer
produces
a
certificate
of
said
government
that
no
indirect
bounty
has
been
received
upon
such
sugar
in
excessive
of
the
tax
collected
upon
the
beet
or
cane
from
which
it
was
produced
and
there
again
we
have
the
guidance
that
the
secretary
found
in
the
early
statuary
history
of
countervailing
duties.
finally,
in
this
brief
excursion
into
the
statutory
history,
in
1897
we
find
that
the
statute
was
revised
and
made
applicable
to
all
imported
products
and
not
just
sugar
and
there
the
proviso
was
deleted,
but
we
find
the
addition
of
language
which
we
believe
for
the
reasons
i
will
state
to
be
a
substitute
for
the
proviso
and
that
language
is
that
there
should
be
levied
that
paid
an
additional
duty
equal
to
the
net
amount
of
such
bounty
or
grant.
and
we
believe
that
the
use
of
net
amount
means
the
amount
in
excess
of
the
tax
otherwise
paid
and
this
would
appear
to
be
the
intention
from
the
floor
debate
that
we
set
forth
on
page
22
and
23
of
our
brief.
and
if
this
legislative
of
history
then
is
proper
guidance,
the
secretary
has
indeed
followed
it
consistently
in
his
application
and
interpretation
of
the
statue
for
80
years,
during
which
time
as
my
brother
pointed
out,
the
congress
has
re-enacted
this
statue
in
almost
the
identical
language.
we
point
out
in
footnote
15
on
page
24
that
the
congress
had
explicit
notification
in
1949
of
the
secretary's
construction
and
application
of
the
statute
and
nonetheless
re-enacted
the
statute,
knowing
that
he
did
not
apply
it
to
the
non
excessive
remission
of
a
excise
tax.
also
and
perhaps
even
more
pertinently,
in
1973
when
the
zenith
petition
was
pending
before
the
secretary,
a
witness
requested
an
amendment
to
require
the
countervailing
non
excessive
remission
and
that
amendment
was
rejected
and
the
congress
of
course
was
aware
not
only
of
the
practice
that
is
attacked
here,
but
also
of
its
application
indeed
to
the
litigant
before
us.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
well,
the
secretary
has
by
regulation
impose
on
the
collector
of
customs,
this
was
delegated
to
him,
the
duty
placed
upon
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
the
collector
of
customs
makes
the
determination
which
can
be
challenged
in
the
customs
court
and
in
the
court
of
customs
appeal.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
we
submit
that
the
customs
court
determines
whether
the
secretary
or
his
delegate
has
made
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
statue.
we
believe
that
this
a
statute
very
much
like
other
statutes
that
are
entrusted
or
the
administration
of
which
is
entrusted
to
administrator,
either
an
agency
or
a
cabinet
officer
and
that
he
has
the
right,
indeed
the
duty
to
make
classifications
to
implement
its
application
and
we
submit
that
the
proper
judicial
review
is
whether
the
classification
is
reasonable
to
carry
out
the
purposes
of
the
statue.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
i
heard
him
say
that
and
i
disagree
with
him.
i
don’t
think
the
customs
code
decides
itself
whether
this
is
a
bounty
or
grant.
i
think
it
decides
whether
the
secretary's
determination
is
a
reasonable
one.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
we
know
because
we
have
80
years
of
consistent
interpretation
on
varying
from
ruling
made
you
today
that
made
in
this
case
that
the
non
excessive
remission
is
not
a
grant
or
a
bounty.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
if
the
court
please,
that
is
correct
and
we
would
agree
that
a
detailed
reason
would
have
to
be
given
if
the
secretary
was
considering
something
that
had
not
been
considered
by
him
before,
but
here
ever
since
as
our
brief
on
page
10,
i
think
note
5
points
out,
since
1898
in
the
first
synopsis
of
decision
696
has
made
the
same
construction
and
after
having
done
that
since
1898
if
my
memory
serves
is
the
year
that
spanish
war
began
and
and
varyingly
he
has
so
interpreted
and
applied
the
statue.
so
we
suggest
that
under
those
circumstances,
perhaps
he
need
not
give
the
kind
of
detailed
reasoning
that
would
be
necessary
otherwise
for
appropriate
judicial
review
of
his
acts.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
if
the
court
please
i
share
the
court's
concern
for
responsible
administrative
action
and
i
think
that
is
that
something
an
administrator
should
do,
but
i
suggest
that
when
this
is
a
consistent
application
perhaps
here
we
need
not
be
as
concerned
as
we
might
be
otherwise
if
it
were
a
new
application.
i’d
like
to
suggest
that
not
only
has
the
secretary
consistently
made
this
interpretation,
but
also
the
international
trading
community
understands
this
to
be
the
construction
of
our
statute
and
indeed
in
the
general
agreement
on
tariffs
and
trade,
an
acronym
pronounced
gatt,
the
agreement
which
we
have
entered
into
through
the
executive
to
the
branch
of
the
government
because
the
congress
has
not
specifically
set
forth
that
the
non
excessive
remission
of
a
consumption
tax
or
an
excise
tax
that
this
japanese
community
tax
as
my
brother
would
agree
is,
is
not
the
grant
of
a
bounty
or
subsidy
that
would
trigger
the
imposition
of
countervailing
duties
which
all
of
the
subscribers
to
the
general
agreement
on
tariffs
and
trade
employ
in
one
way
or
another.
so
we
suggest
that
here
we
have
80
years
of
uninterrupted,
unvarying
construction
of
the
statute,
of
the
original
statute
with
congressional
re-enactment
5
times
with
awareness
not
only
of
the
practice,
but
also
of
the
specific
application
to
zenith,
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
we
suggest
that
the
classification
that
the
administrator
has
adopted
is
reasonable
under
all
the
circumstances
and
so
that
even
if
this
case
fell
outside
of
it,
it
would
still
be
appropriate
as
this
court
has
recognized
if
a
classification
is
reasonable,
although
we
do
not
have
to
argue
that
because
we
believe
that
this
case
is
well
inside
of
it.
we
also
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
if
the
court
please,
we
do
make
that
concession,
yes
and
that
is
correct
as
we
understand
it.
we
would
also
like
to
observe
that
as
my
brother
has
argued
and
as
the
dissent
in
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
urges,
this
is
not
inconsistent
with
any
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
as
mr.
justice
stevens'
inquiry
yesterday
afternoon
brought
out,
in
the
downs
case
which
my
brother
urges
is
a
governing
precedent
and
would
require
this
court
to
the
rule
to
the
contrary,
we
did
not
have
an
excessive
remission
of
an
excise
tax
simplicitor,
we
have
there
instead
the
remission
of
the
tax
and
the
bestowing
of
a
certificate
which
was
the
matter
of
great
economic
value
and
as
the
colloquy
between
the
court
and
my
brother
developed
and
demonstrated,
the
amount
of
the
duty
that
was
countervailed
was
either
the
value
of
that
certificate
or
a
profit
derived
from
the
exercise
of
that
certificate
and
was
not
in
the
amount
of
a
excise
tax
that
was
remitted.
also
my
brother
made
reference
to
other
authority
which
he
believe
was
controlling
of
this,
contrary
to
the
position
of
the
government,
we
suggest
that
in
examination
of
that
authority
would
reveal
that
it
is
not.
the
nicolas
case
involve
a
clear
export
premium.
this
was
a
case
involving
the
export
of
spirits
from
the
british
isles
to
the
united
states
and
therein
an
express
premium
of
(inaudible)
and
5
pence
on
different
quality
or
strength
of
spirits
was
bestowed
and
indeed
the
question
there
was
whether
there
was
some
warehouse
tax
that
would
justify
england
giving
this
advantage
found
to
be
a
grant
or
bounty
and
the
court
held
that
regardless
of
the
british
government's
purpose,
it
was
indeed
a
grant
or
bounty.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
if
the
court
please,
we
do
concede
that
there
is
that
language
in
downs
that
is
against
us
and
this
court
has
cautioned
us
us
and
other
counsels
that
appear
here
many
times
of
the
hazard
of
taking
language
out
of
the
context
of
an
opinion
and
urging
it
is
controlling
in
another
situation.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
if
the
court
please,
i
wish
i
can
answer
that
simply
and
i
will
give
you
the
best
answer
i
can
because
i
find
that
the
downs
opinion
is
one
of
the
most
confusing
opinion
i
tried
to
parse
in
a
number
of
years.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
i
would
like
to
think
that
it
was
alone
in
this
classification,
but
i
have
to
agree
that
it
is
not,
but
downs
concerns
a
very
complex
system
of
controlling
sugar
prices
within
souris
(ph)
russia
and
apparently
every
producer
had
to
place
his
sugar
into
three
categories,
so
called
free
sugar,
other
sugar
that
could
be
transferred
into
free
sugar
under
certain
circumstances
and
then
surplus
sugar
and
there
was
a
one
level
of
tax
on
the
free
sugar
and
that
was
an
excise
that
could
be
levied
for
domestic
consumption.
there
was
a
double
tax
on
the
surplus
sugar.
the
sugar
in
the
middle
apparently
was
subject
to
manipulation
by
bureaucracy
that
over
saw
this
entire
scheme.
to
sell
the
surplus
sugar
to
double
tax
was
prohibitive
so
nobody
would
want
to
do
that,
but
apparently
some
of
these
person
would
like
to
export
that
and
if
they
exported
that
sugar
then
the
tax
would
be
remitted
and
it
could
go
abroad.
now,
it
was
not
just
a
remission
of
this
tax
that
occurred
when
it
was
exported,
but
also
a
certificate
was
given,
a
thing
of
value
that
permitted
a
person
then
to
transfer
from
his
surplus
sugar
to
his
free
sugar.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
in
the
domestic
market
an
equivalent
amount
and
it
was
not
the
remission
the
tax
that
was
countervailed
there,
but
it
was
an
amount
equivalent
either
to
the
value
of
the
certificate
or
computed
in
some
way
on
the
value
of
the
certificate
and
as
for
this
reason
that
i
respond
to
the
court
that
language
is
taken
utterly
out
of
context.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
well,
it
appears
that
the
parties
conceded
the
amount
that
they
were
discussing
and
i
submit
that
if
a
court
uses
language
not
necessary
to
the
decision
of
the
case
that
that
language
is
not
controlling
because
a
case
decides
a
controversy
and
this
court
does
not
issue
advisory
opinions
and
if
this
language
is
to
cover
a
situation
not
before
the
court,
it
should
not
be
deemed
by
anyone
who
reads
it
or
this
court,
to
bind
the
court
in
another
situation.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
it
purports
to
be
that
and
in
this
respect
its
confusing.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
it
has
all
the
vices
of
irresponsibility,
but
it
does
not
decide
the
controversy.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
i
would
doubt
that
and
wish
that
i
had
suggested
it
earlier.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
that
is
exactly
so.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
i
leave
the
court,
i
am
having
enough
difficulties
of
this
problem
and
i
would
like
for
you
to
make
a
comment.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
that
is
correct
and
i
would
suggest
too
that
since
downs,
the
secretary
has
consistently
countervailed
only
excessive
remissions
and
the
congress
has
been
aware
of
it
and
the
congress
must
be
presumed
to
be
aware
of
downs,
including
this
language.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
well,
i
would
prefer
to
say
that
the
secretary
has
consistently
recognized
what
downs
really
held
despite
the
language
and
he
has
consistently
followed
that
practice
and
with
congressional
concurrence
and
here
we
are
concerned
with
the
matter
that
is
entirely
within
the
province
of
the
congress,
the
congress
has
established
the
countervailing
tax
and
the
congress
can
take
this
away
and
i
believe
our
job
here
is
to
decide
what
has
the
congress
decided
to
do
and
when
the
congress
has
specifically
declined
to
require
the
countervailing
of
non
excessive
remission
in
the
case
of
this
very
litigant
it
would
appear
that
the
secretary
is
indeed
following
the
congress'
direction.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
i
do
not
think
it
means
anything
as
far
as
the
duty
of
this
court
is
concerned
here
today.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
i
do
not
and
i
certainly
circulated
it
only
because
it
had
been
forwarded
to
us
from
the
department
of
state
and
we
circulated
it
for
what
it
was
worth.
we
do
not
suggest
that
this
court
should
be
responsive
either
to
any
threat
or
any
apprehension
of
apocalyptic
consequences
in
the
field
of
international
trade.
this
court's
task
as
we
see
it
is
to
decide
what
did
the
congress
mean
by
these
words
bounty
or
grant
in
the
tariff
act
of
1930
as
illuminated
by
the
legislative
history
that
we
have
written
about
in
our
brief
and
discussed
this
morning
and
as
illustrated
by
the
consistent
practice
of
the
secretary
over
80
years
and
as
illustrated
by
the
understanding
of
the
international
trading
community
and
we
think
that
this
court
of
course
would
expect
the
congress
to
respond
in
any
way
it
deem
fit
if
the
congress
did
not
agree
with
the
statute
as
this
court
will
ultimately
construe
it,
but
this
court
has
the
power,
has
the
absolute
power
to
construe
this
as
it
sees
it
in
its
inform
judicial
judgment.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
well
if
the
court
please,
i
regard
my
role
here
as
seeking
to
uphold
the
construction
that
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
has
placed
upon
the
statute
committed
to
him
to
administer
and
the
client
of
the
government
here
is
the
secretary
of
the
state
and
not
upon
principle
to
take.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
the
official
whom
we
represent
here
is
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
who
is
the
person
who
is
required
to
do
this?
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
he
has
not.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
that
is
exactly
correct,
if
the
court
pleases.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
and
that
is
subject
to
review.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
indeed
does
and
very
much
like
the
labor
board
does.
the
labor
board
does
not
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
my
recollection
is
that
it
did
not
identify
the
person.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
that
is
correct.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
i
believe
the
delegation
is
really
to
the
general
counsel
of
the
treasury
by
the
secretary.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
yes.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
i
cannot
give
you
the
exact
quotation,
but
it
was
to
the
secretary
of
the
treasury,
he
was
the
executive
branch
official
required
to
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
at
the
time
of
downs.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
i
think
that
is
a
fair
statement,
if
the
court
pleases.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
i
think
he
would
have
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
the
secretary's
position
at
the
time
of
downs
was
as
we
indicate
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
he
was
not,
if
one
reads
the
briefs
in
downs
and
reads
the
record
before
it
reached
the
supreme
court
in
downs,
the
entire
contention
was
what
to
do
about
amount
the
amount
of
the
certificate,
the
value
of
the
certificate
and
not
the
excise
tax
that
was
remitted.
it
was
a
thing
above
the
remission
of
the
excise
tax
and
that
is
the
nub
of
our
entire
argument.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree
the
imposition
of
a
countervailing
duty
and
the
amount
of
that.
in
the
appendix
at
49,
51
the
secretary's
view
in
downs
is
set
forth
in
detail
and
so
the
government
respectfully
requests
and
submits
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
here
is
correct
and
ask
this
court
to
affirm
it.
thank
you.
