mr.
frederick
l.
ikenson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
first
like
to
address
myself
to
the
question
imposed
by
mr.
justice
white
regarding
the
role
of
the
collector
of
customs
and
the
secretary.
the
statue
has
consistently
given
authority
to
the
secretary
to
determine
the
amount
of
countervailing
duty
to
be
assessed.
the
secretary
delegates
functions
to
collectors
of
customs
throughout
the
united
state
to
assess
countervailing
duties
to
offset
particular
grants.
in
the
downs
case
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
made
a
determination
that
the
russian
program
conferred
a
bounty
or
grant
and
then
issued
instructions
throughout
united
state
to
collectors
of
customs.
the
downs
case
arose
in
baltimore
where
the
collector
there
imposed
a
countervailing
duty
in
an
amount
equal
to
that
contained
in
the
instruction
from
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
that
was
protested
by
the
importer
who
then
litigated
the
subject.
mr.
frederick
l.
ikenson
that
is
not
correct
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
l.
ikenson
well,
at
the
very
outset
of
the
case,
the
amount
of
countervailing
duty
was
not
put
in
an
issue
for
the
reasons
that
i
give
yesterday.
the
amount
of
countervail
is
not
deem
to
be
judicially
reviewable.
the
question
framed
by
the
parties
was
whether
the
russian
program
conferred
a
bounty
or
grant.
the
courts
below,
the
board
of
general
appraisers
and
then
the
fourth
circuit
determined
that
yes
there
was
a
bounty
or
grant
for
two
reasons.
mr.
frederick
l.
ikenson
the
collector
of
customs
made
no
determination.
he
just
made
an
assessment
of
duty.
he
made
no
determination.
the
secretary
--
mr.
frederick
l.
ikenson
it
rested
on
instructions
to
collect
so
many
cents
per
ton.
mr.
frederick
l.
ikenson
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
l.
ikenson
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
l.
ikenson
i
would
say
not.
it
was
not
asked
to
agree
or
to
disagree
with
the
secretary's
determination
to
assess
a
particular
amount
of
duty.
mr.
frederick
l.
ikenson
yes
your
honor,
they
did
agree
with
the
secretary
that
there
was
a
reason.
mr.
frederick
l.
ikenson
that
is
correct,
to
be
challenge
by
the
importer.
mr.
frederick
l.
ikenson
that
is
correct
and
i
think
it
is
very
important
to
appreciate
the
kind
of
review
that
was
available
to
importers
at
the
time
of
downs
and
continuing
through
the
present
day.
there
was
de
novo
review
before
the
board
of
general
appraisers
which
is
predecessors
to
the
customs
court,
it
is
improper
to
suggest
that
the
standard
of
review
is
review
based
on
administrative
record
which
then
must
be
tested
by
either
substantial
evidence
or
some
standard
of
reasonableness.
there
is
a
trial
de
novo.
every
countervailing
duty
case
that
has
ever
been
litigated
since
the
turn
of
the
century
has
been
the
subject
of
a
trial
de
novo,
either
before
the
customs
court
or
its
predecessor,
the
board
of
general
appraisers.
in
the
downs
case
there
was
a
trial
de
novo.
downs
argued
that
--
mr.
frederick
l.
ikenson
i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor?
mr.
frederick
l.
ikenson
well,
it
questions
fact,
a
presumption
of
correctness
attaches
to
the
secretary's
determination.
the
importer
then
approaches
the
court
when
those
days
the
board
with
the
obligation
to
rebut
that
presumption,
to
go
forward
and
present
evidence
to
show
that
the
secretary's
determination
was
incorrect.
mr.
frederick
l.
ikenson
i
would
say
that
they
give
difference
to
the
secretary,
there
are
standard
presumptions
of
correctness
that
attach
to
government
officials'
actions
and
if
that
is
what
your
honor
means
by
suggesting
that
at
least
the
kind
of
difference
that
your
honors
give,
i
would
say,
yes.
there
is
a
difference
that
the
judiciary
--
mr.
frederick
l.
ikenson
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
l.
ikenson
an
index
of
its
opinion?
mr.
frederick
l.
ikenson
there
may
have
been
some
assistance
given
to
the
board
for
the
purpose
of
helping
research
cases,
but
they
are
bound
volumes
of
customs
court
reports
going
back
to
before
the
turn
of
the
century
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
l.
ikenson
yes.
mr.
frederick
l.
ikenson
it
is
true
your
honor.
there
were
bound
volumes.
it
might
have
been
difficult
--
mr.
frederick
l.
ikenson
i
am
afraid
i
do
miss
the
point
of
your
honor's
question.
mr.
frederick
l.
ikenson
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
like
very
much
to
turn
back
to
downs
and
the
issue
as
put
to
the
court,
downs
argued
after
the
board
of
general
appraisers
decided
against
them
and
after
the
fourth
circuit
decided
against
them,
they
argued
before
this
court
that
the
lower
courts
were
wrong.
they
argued
that
the
lower
courts
found
that
the
russian
scheme
conferred
two
bounties,
a
bounty
by
the
reason
of
the
tax
remission,
a
bounty
by
reason
of
the
conferring
of
the
certificate.
downs
maybe
clear
to
the
court
that
this
was
his
understanding
of
what
the
lower
court
had
said
and
then
downs
argued
in
this
brief
that
courts
below
are
wrong
on
both
issues.
downs
argued
that
the
certificate
did
not
constituted
a
bounty.
downs
also
argued
that
the
remission
of
tax
did
not
constitute
a
bounty.
this
was
squarely
put
before
this
court.
it
was
briefed
by
downs.
downs
headed
a
section
of
this
brief
with
the
following
language.
the
remission
of
excise
taxes
on
the
exportation
of
sugar
is
not
a
bounty
or
grant
on
exportation
as
the
terms
are
used
in
section
5.
the
government
joined
issue
with
downs
on
both
points.
the
government
said
that
both
the
remission
of
the
tax
could
be
a
bounty
and
both
the
certificate
could
be
a
bounty.
the
court
then
decided
the
issues
presented
to
it.
i
would
like
to
turn
to
some
other
remarks
made
by
my
distinguished
advisory.
he
indicated
that
in
1949,
congress
received
explicit
notice
of
treasury's
practice
and
did
not
amended
it.
however,
that
is
not
the
entire
story
because
in
that
period
of
time,
1949
and
1950,
when
the
executive
branch
brought
treasury's
practice
to
the
attention
congress,
it
asked
congress
to
amend
the
law
because
there
was
a
potential
conflict
between
treasury's
practice
and
judicial
interpretations.
congress
refused
to
amend
the
law.
mr.
frederick
l.
ikenson
the
downs
and
nicolas,
in
treasury
department
explanation
to
the
congress,
there
was
no
specific
reference
to
the
courts'
decisions.
mr.
frederick
l.
ikenson
and
so
they
said
they
were
judicial
interpretations.
congress
refused,
in
1973
the
solicitor
general
--
mr.
frederick
l.
ikenson
there
was
a
bill
introduced
which
--
mr.
frederick
l.
ikenson
it
got
out
of
committee
in
1950.
it
passed
the
house
and
then
it
died.
the
following
year
it
was
introduced.
it
did
not
get
out
of
the
senate
finance
committee.
mr.
frederick
l.
ikenson
the
reports
indicate
that
congress
was
concerned
about
other
features
of
the
bill
which
would
have
provided
for
injury
requirements
which
was
not
present
in
countervailing
duty
statute.
however,
the
testimony
of
the
committee
hearings
are
instructive
in
that
--
mr.
frederick
l.
ikenson
the
second
time
around
your
honor
the
bill
did
not
get
reported
and
in
trying
to
understand
the
reason
why
the
bill
was
not
reported
out,
we
can
look
to
the
hearings
and
we
find
that
there
is
testimony
of
at
least
one
senator
who
felt
that
the
conflict
between
the
treasury's
practice
and
judiciary's
interpretation
was
not
satisfactory.
mr.
frederick
l.
ikenson
not
by
name
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
l.
ikenson
well,
i
raise
this
your
honor
only
to
respond
to
my
brother's
suggestion
that
some
weight
should
be
given
to
the
fact
that
congress
knew
of
the
practice
in
1949
and
did
nothing
to
repeal
it.
it
was
in
fact
asked
to
codfy
and
refused.
that
is
my
point
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
l.
ikenson
i
think.
mr.
frederick
l.
ikenson
that
is
that
the
congress
did
not
steps
to
change
the
statute?
mr.
frederick
l.
ikenson
i
think
not
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
if
the
congress
is
told
that
there
is
a
potential
conflict
between
a
judicial
interpretation
and
administrative
practice
and
congress
does
nothing,
if
anything
is
to
be
inferred
it
should
be
that
congress
was
satisfied
with
the
judicial
interpretation.
mr.
frederick
l.
ikenson
well,
that
is
something
that
i
did
not
consider
your
honor.
in
1973,
the
solicitor
general
advised
that
a
witness
suggested
to
the
congress
that
the
law
be
changed
to
clearly
provide
that
the
remission
of
indirect
tax
on
exportation
be
deemed
a
bounty
or
grant
and
congress
did
not
adopt
this
suggestion.
i
do
not
think
any
great
weight
can
be
given
to
this
turn
of
events
because
congress
in
1973
and
74
clearly
wanted
to
pave
the
way
for
a
smooth
negotiations
for
international
agreement.
it
did
not
wish
to
begin
at
that
time
to
isolate
specific
bounty
practices
and
instruct
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
that
he
must
immediately
begin
countervailing.
instead
congress
did
devise
this
very
complex
scheme
which
i
described
to
your
honors
yesterday,
i
think
that
was
congress'
way
of
dealing
with
the
problem.
it
wanted
an
international
agreement.
it
did
not
want
to
be
selective.
thank
you,
your
honors.
