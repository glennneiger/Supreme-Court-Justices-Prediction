unknown
speaker
or
neither?
unknown
speaker
mr.
ikenson,
do
we
know
here,
exactly
what
principle
the
secretary
applied
in
reaching
this
decision?
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general
does
the
word
drawback
have,
is
that
term
of
archive
sounds
it
is
familiar
to
me?
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
thought
yesterday
that
your
opposition
said
that
the
customs
code
regarded
this
as
de
novo,
do
you
agree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
then
my
next
question
is
why
it
would
have
asked
him
if
i
presented
in
other
way,
how
do
we
know
from
this
record
what
the
standard
is
the
secretary
employed
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly
in
this
case
the
secretary
did
not
say
that
much,
he
said
that
for
years
and
and
he
must
(voice
overlap)
about
for
the
democracy.
unknown
speaker
i
guess
all
i
am
saying
is
i
would
feel
a
little
more
comfortable
had
he
spelled
out
his
reasons
where
we
have
judicial
review.
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general
could
i
ask
a
question
and
perhaps
i
should
ask,
it
maybe
little
delicate,
but
at
the
request
of
the
department
of
the
state,
you
distributed
a
communication
from
the
government
of
japan
on
this
matter
and
let
me
read
from
one
portion
of
that.
the
government
of
japan
fully
understands
that
the
government
of
the
united
state
has
acted
in
good
faith
and
so
forth.
in
the
unlikely
event
that
the
united
states
should
proceed
in
the
manner
violative
of
the
very
international
rules
and
the
establishment
of
which
it
is
taken
leadership
to
further
the
objective
of
free
international
trade.
those
countries
who
join
with
the
united
states
in
establishing
such
rules
to
promote
economic
development
through
normalization
of
international
trade
might
be
compelled
to
question
the
good
faith
to
united
states.
what
does
that
mean
vis-a-vis
this
case?
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
regard
that
as
instruct
to
this
court?
unknown
speaker
in
any
event
you
are
here
in
good
faith
arguing
with
us
to
uphold
the
position
followed
by
the
government
of
japan
anyway?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
secretary
of
treasury?
unknown
speaker
you
say
the
you
talk
about
the
consistent
administrative
construction
just
to
make
it
so
i’m
sure
of
it,
he
is
never
having
a
rule
making
proceeding
on
this,
has
he?
unknown
speaker
and
it’s
all
rested
in
adjudication
or
it
is
rested
in
rulings
by
the
collector
of
customs
and
which
in
essence
is
an
adjudication
by
him.
unknown
speaker
except
and
that
is
subject
to
review?
unknown
speaker
so
it
is
rested
in
the
line
of
adjudications?
unknown
speaker
do
you
or
do
you
recall
in
your
work
on
this
whether
the
statute
that
was
at
issue
in
downs
also
delegated
power
to
the
secretary
or
was
it
directly
to
the
collector
of
customs?
unknown
speaker
because
that
case
started
out
by
a
ruling
of
the
collector
customs
i
take
it
and
there
was
a
board
of
appraisers?
unknown
speaker
but
did
the
secretary
of
treasury
get
into
the
act
for
the
first
time
after
downs?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
not
now.
unknown
speaker
but
the
congress
now
delegates,
it
is
clearly
the
secretary
of
treasury
and
i
am
just
wondering
if
under
the
statute
that
was
in
force
at
the
time
of
downs
that
the
congress
empowered
the
secretary
rather
than
the
customs
collector?
unknown
speaker
at
the
time
of
downs?
unknown
speaker
alright,
do
you
what
position
the
secretary
may
took
at
the
time
of
downs?
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
think
it
was
what
the
court
said?
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
way
the
case
started
by
imposition
of
a
charge
by
the
--
unknown
speaker
and
this
court
agreed
to
the
secretary,
upheld
the
secretary?
unknown
speaker
is
it
not,
what
are
they
saying?
unknown
speaker
well,
so
did
the
collector
of
customs,
i
take
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
his
assessment
had
to
rest
on
something?
unknown
speaker
the
secretary
of
treasury
had
made
a
determination?
unknown
speaker
and
which
the
collector
was
following?
unknown
speaker
and
so
in
that
sense
did
not
this
court
agree
with
the
secretary
or
not?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
how
about
whether
or
not
there
was
a
reason
for
a
countervailing
duty?
unknown
speaker
what
issues
are
determined
in
the
trial
de
novo?
unknown
speaker
what
issues
are
determined
in
de
novo?
unknown
speaker
what
difference
does
the
customs
court
expected
to
give
to
the
secretary's
interpretation
of
the
statute,
at
least
as
much
as
we
might?
unknown
speaker
whether
or
not
the
secretary
is
ignoring
downs
or
not,
i
guess
it
is
true
that
he
has
for
a
long
time
taking
a
position
contrary
to
yours?
unknown
speaker
is
that
in
the
parole
interpretations
to
the
cases
in
this
court,
downs
and
what
else?
unknown
speaker
by
name?
unknown
speaker
refused
and
just
did
not,
was
there
a
bill
introduced?
unknown
speaker
did
it
get
out
of
committee?
unknown
speaker
are
those
committee
reports
instructive
or
not?
unknown
speaker
and
what
about
the
report
indicated,
what
did
it
say
about
countervailing
duties?
unknown
speaker
any
reference
in
that
colloquy
to
downs
by
name?
