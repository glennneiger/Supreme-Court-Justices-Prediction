mr.
fredrick
l.
ikenson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
the
question
whether
the
forgiveness
of
a
commodity
tax
on
the
exportation
of
certain
consumer
electronic
products
from
japan
is
a
bounty
or
grant
under
our
countervailing
duty
law.
the
petitioner
is
a
domestic
producer
of
such
consumer
electronic
products
as
television
sets,
radios
and
the
like.
in
1970,
the
petitioner
filed
a
complaint
with
the
treasury
department,
claiming
that
japan
conferred
a
bounty
or
grant
upon
the
exportation
of
like
products
by
reason
of
the
remission
of
a
commodity
tax
on
exportation.
in
january
of
1976,
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
made
a
determination
that
no
bounty
or
grant
was
paid
or
bestowed
on
exportation.
under
a
then
recently
enacted
statute,
the
petitioner
sought
and
obtained
judicial
review
over
the
secretary?s
negative
determination
in
the
united
states
customs
court.
from
the
pleadings
filed
by
the
parties
in
the
court,
it
became
clear
that
the
essential
facts
were
not
in
dispute.
japan
imposes
a
commodity
tax
on
certain
products
when
shipped
from
the
manufacturer?s
factory
for
domestic
consumption,
that
is
consumption
in
japan,
however,
the
same
products
when
shipped
for
export
from
japan
are
exempt
from
payment
of
the
commodity
tax.
each
of
the
parties
moved
for
summary
judgment.
petitioner
arguing
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
remission
of
the
tax
on
exportation
constituted
a
bounty
or
grant,
the
government
arguing
the
contrary.
a
three-judge
panel
of
the
customs
court
agreed
with
the
petitioner
and
awarded
a
summary
judgment.
on
appeal,
the
court
of
customs
on
patent
appeals,
reversed
in
a
3
to
2
decision
and
on
february
of
this
year,
this
court
granted
certiorari.
we
say,
your
honors,
that
the
tax
remission
clearly
is
a
bounty
or
grant
on
exportation
and
that
off
setting
duties
called
countervailing
duties,
should
be
assessed
on
imported
products
from
japan
which
benefit
from
the
tax
remission.
the
countervailing
duty
law
as
it
now
exists
has
remained
essentially
unchanged
since
the
first
general
countervailing
duty
law
was
enacted
as
section
5
of
the
tariff
act
of
1897.
since
that
time
the
law
was
re-enacted
five
times
and
it
was
twice
construed
by
this
court
in
the
downs
case
and
in
the
nicholas
case.
both
decisions
make
clear
that
the
statute?s
coverage
is
extremely
broad
and
particularly
with
respect
to
the
remission
of
tax
and
exportation
that
that
event
is
a
bounty
or
grant.
in
downs,
the
first
of
the
two
of
countervailing
duty
cases
considered
by
this
court,
the
court
had
before
it
a
very
complex
russian
program
which
sought
to
control
the
production,
price
and
exportation
of
sugar.
the
scheme
was
extremely
complicated,
but
it
included
two
facts
which
this
court
considered
most
important.
fact
number
one,
all
sugar
sold
domestically
was
subject
to
an
excise
tax.
fact
number
two,
all
sugar
exported
from
russia
was
exported
free
of
such
tax.
the
court
proceeded
to
state
that
whenever
a
tax
is
imposed
upon
all
sugar
produced,
but
is
remitted
on
all
sugar
exported
then
by
whatever
process
or
in
whatever
manner
or
under
whatever
name
it
is
disguised,
it
is
a
bounty
upon
exportation.
now,
it
is
true
there
was
another
aspect
of
the
russian
plan
which
the
court
considered.
exporters
of
sugar
received
certificates
which
were
marketable
and
valuable.
the
court
discussed
whether
or
not
these
certificates
also
constituted
a
bounty
or
grant.
the
court
said
that
it
did,
but
that
does
not
detract
from
the
court?s
very
forceful
language
that
the
principle
and
the
key
facts
in
the
entire
scheme
were
the
two
that
i
mentioned
to
your
honors,
that
all
sugar
sold
in
the
home
market
was
taxed
and
that
all
sugar
exported
was
sold
free
of
tax.
this
language
of
this
court
declaring
that
the
remission
of
tax
under
such
circumstances
is
a
bounty
or
grant,
requiring
the
imposition
of
countervailing
duties
is
not
or
was
not
unguarded
language
as
the
government
would
characterize
it.
that
language
is
consistent
with
repeated
statements
of
this
court,
both
in
the
downs
case
and
in
cases
subsequent
to
and
prior
to
downs.
in
the
nicholas
case,
the
only
other
countervailing
duty
case
this
court
cited
as
an
example
of
a
bounty
or
grant
on
exportation,
the
remission
of
the
tax
when
that
tax
is
levied
on
products
sold
in
the
home
market.
in
an
earlier
case,
in
passevant,
the
court
expressed
its
recognition
as
to
why
governments
remit
taxes
on
exportation.
the
court
said,
?doubtless,
to
encourage
exportation,
to
encourage
the
introduction
of
domestic
goods
into
export
markets,
taxes
are
remitted
on
exportation.
there
was
no
mystery
about
the
benefits
of
tax
remission
on
exportation.
the
court
perceived
the
benefit
and
the
court
deemed
such
a
benefit
to
be
a
countervailable
bounty
or
grant.
notwithstanding
the
teachings
of
this
court
which
are
quite
clear,
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
has
developed
a
practice
under
the
countervailing
duty
law
of
excusing
from
countervail
remissions
of
indirect
tax.
the
practice
unquestionably
conflicts
with
decisions
of
this
court.
now,
as
i
said
earlier,
the
congress
re-enacted
the
statute
five
times
since
1897
and
it
re-enacted
it
several
times
after
this
court?s
downs
decision
and
after
this
court?s
nicholas
decision.
of
course,
the
congress
re-enacted
the
statute
after
the
administrative
practice
began
to
be
put
into
place.
a
fundamental
question
arises,
by
re-enactment
of
the
statute
after
this
court?s
decision
and
after
the
administrative
practice
of
the
secretary,
what
did
congress
have
in
mind?
did
congress
intend
to
ratify
the
practice
or
did
congress
intend
to
ratify
this
court?s
decisions?
the
question
is
so
simple
--
mr.
fredrick
l.
ikenson
that
is
always
a
possibility,
your
honor,
except
that
i
think
it
is
a
rather
well
settled
principle
that
when
congress
re-enacts
a
statute
after
a
judicial
interpretation
of
the
statute
becomes
known
to
it,
it
is
deemed
to
have
ratified
that
interpretation.
mr.
fredrick
l.
ikenson
i
think
not,
your
honor.
i
think,
clearly
the
congress
--
mr.
fredrick
l.
ikenson
that
is
correct.
our
point
is
this.
congress
was
aware
of
the
downs
case
and
certainly
by
the
time
of
the
last
re-enactment
in
the
trade
act
of
1974,
it
was
aware
of
the
nicholas
case,
it
was
aware
of
the
administrative
practice.
how
did
congress
respond
in
the
trade
act
of
1974?
firstly,
it
opened
the
courts
to
american
manufacturers
by
providing
especially
for
judiciary
review
over
negative
countervailing
duty
determinations
by
the
secretary.
this
enabled
the
american
manufacturers
who
were
aggrieved
by
the
non-assessment
of
countervailing
duties
on
imports
which
were
benefited
by
tax
remission
on
export
to
come
to
the
courts
and
to
invoke
this
court?s
teachings
of
downs
and
nicholas.
the
congress
went
further.
the
key
committees
of
the
congress
discussed
the
administrative
practice
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
trade
act
and
said
that
?we
are
neither
approving
nor
disapproving
of
that
practice.
they
rather
invited
resolution
of
the
question
of
the
courts,
by
making
judicial
review
available
to
american
manufacturers,
by
stating
clearly
that
they
were
not
expressing
approval
or
disapproval
of
the
administrative
practice.
mr.
fredrick
l.
ikenson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
fredrick
l.
ikenson
i
must
preface
my
response
to
your
honor
by
saying
that
the
value
of
the
grant
in
the
downs
case
was
not
before
the
court.
it
was
the
understanding
of
the
parties
at
the
time
and
of
the
courts
below
that
the
amount
of
countervail
was
not
judicially
reviewable.
the
sole
question
was
whether
or
not
the
entire
russian
scheme
constituted
a
conferral
of
a
bounty
or
grant.
so
whether
or
not
the
actual
amount
of
countervailing
duty
was
correct
was
never
put
before
the
court.
now,
to
respond
more
directly
to
your
honor?s
question,
the
amount
of
countervail
put
on
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
was
equal
to
what
the
secretary
determined
to
be
the
profit
gained
by
the
russian
exporter
by
reason
of
the
export
certificate.
i
would
not
say
that
the
amount
of
countervail
equaled
the
value
of
the
certificate.
it
was
based
upon
the
secretary?s
determination
of
profit
that
was
earned.
mr.
fredrick
l.
ikenson
when
the
court
discussed
the
certificate
and
indicated
what
value
it
felt
the
certificate
had,
it
said
clearly
the
value
of
the
certificate
is
1.25
rubles
per
pood
which
was
the
unit
of
weight
because
that
was
the
amount
of
money
that
an
exporter
could
receive
for
his
certificate.
the
court
looked
differently
at
the
value
of
the
certificate
than
the
secretary
of
the
treasury,
but
i
hope
i
have
not
given
your
honor
too
long
an
answer
to
a
short
question.
mr.
fredrick
l.
ikenson
we
say,
your
honor,
that
there
is
no
latitude
at
all.
the
statute
is
mandatory.
it
is
clear,
and
as
understood
by
congress
the
amount
of
discretion
given
to
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
is
very
slight
if
existent
at
all.
the
secretary
has
discretion
to
determine
the
amount
of
a
bounty
or
grant.
he
does
not
have
discretion
to
determine
what
a
bounty
or
grant
is.
mr.
fredrick
l.
ikenson
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
fredrick
l.
ikenson
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
fredrick
l.
ikenson
i
would
say
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
a
program
is
or
is
not
a
bounty
or
grant.
they
--
mr.
fredrick
l.
ikenson
that
is
correct.
my
next
point
was,
your
honor,
that
in
this
particular
case,
with
this
particular
type
of
program,
the
court
has
determined
that
as
a
matter
of
law
a
tax
remission
on
export
is
a
bounty
or
grant.
i
would
like
to
comment
further
--
mr.
fredrick
l.
ikenson
yes,
but
in
those
cases
the
administrator
is
conferred
a
broad
discretion
in
administering
the
statute
--
mr.
fredrick
l.
ikenson
well,
in
this
particular
statute,
your
honor,
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
is
not
even
named
as
the
person
who
shall
determine
whether
a
bounty
or
grant
is
bestowed
instead
the
statute
has
read
consistently
whenever
a
bounty
or
grant
is
bestowed,
etc.,
then
the
secretary
shall
determine
the
amount
of
bounty
or
grant
and
assess
the
duty.
mr.
fredrick
l.
ikenson
as
a
practical
matter
--
mr.
fredrick
l.
ikenson
that
is
correct
and
i
should
say
that
this
has
already
been
discussed
by
a
lower
court
in
1940.
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
noted
that
the
statute
does
not
even
provide
that
the
secretary
should
make
the
initial
determination,
however,
as
a
matter
of
custom
and
common
sense
it
should
be
the
secretary
to
make
this
determination.
mr.
fredrick
l.
ikenson
we
do
not
know,
your
honor.
the
secretary
did
not
offer
any
explanation
as
to
his
reason
for
not
countervailing.
however,
we
do
not
claim
that
that
is
an
error
in
this
case
because
we
view
the
role
of
the
customs
court
as
being
a
court
that
accords
trial
de
novo,
and
we
are
not
reviewing
it
under
the
general
terms
of
general
standards
of
review.
we
look
to
an
administrative
record
or
the
standards
of
arbitrariness
and
propitiousness
and
the
like.
we
had
a
trial
de
novo
available
to
us
in
the
customs
court
and
under
those
circumstances
we
do
not
feel
that
it
was
error
for
the
secretary
not
to
have
elaborated
on
his
reasons
for
his
negative
determination.
i
would
like
to
comment
briefly
on
a
point
made
by
the
chief
justice
regarding
the
congress?
awareness
of
the
sensitivity
of
this
problem.
there
is
no
question
that
congress
appreciates
that
the
application
of
countervailing
duties
is
a
very
delicate
issue,
that
the
application
of
countervailing
duties
by
the
united
states
unilaterally,
certainly
can
cause
international
friction.
congress
was
aware
of
this
when
it
enacted
the
trade
act
and
it
devised
a
master
plan
to
deal
with
countervailing
duties.
on
the
one
hand,
it
was
concerned
about
promoting
international
harmony
and
international
trade.
on
the
other
hand,
it
was
concerned
about
permitting
domestic
industry
to
stand
by
and
suffer
because
it
had
to
compete
with
unfair
competition
with
bounty
fed
or
subsidized
competition.
so
congress
struck
a
very
delicate
balance.
it
directed
the
executive
branch
to
try
to
negotiate
an
agreement
on
the
application
of
countervailing
duties.
on
the
other
hand,
it
directed
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
enforce
the
countervailing
duty
law
by
putting
time
limits
on
him
in
handling
countervailing
duty
petitions.
it
also
provided
for
judicial
review
of
negative
determinations.
congress
had
to
do
more
to
prevent
american
manufacturers?
suits
from
upsetting
the
international
applecart.
so
what
congress
did
was
to
give
limited
discretion
to
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
postpone
the
assessment
of
countervailing
duties
in
cases
where
bounties
or
grants
were
bestowed.
this
is
the
way
that
international
friction
could
be
avoided
under
the
congressional
plan.
this
is
what
congress
provided.
however,
the
government
was
not
content
with
this
plan.
rather
the
government
has
chosen
to
call
to
your
honor?s
attention
the
alarming
consequences
that
could
follow
from
a
reversal
by
this
court.
we
say
that
those
consequences
need
not
occur
and,
furthermore
congress
was
aware
of
the
danger
of
such
consequences,
it
provided
for
it
and
any
consideration
of
them
by
this
court
would
be
unnecessary,
it
would
be
improper.
it
is
not
part
of
the
congressional
contemplation.
i
would
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
your
honors.
