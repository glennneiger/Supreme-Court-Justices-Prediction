r.

mr.
ikenson,
can
i
ask
you
a
factual
question
about
the
downs
case
because
it
is
kind
of
a
hard
case
to
understand?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
solicitor
general
says
that
the
actual
countervailing
duty
that
was
assessed
there
was
measured
by
the
value
of
the
certificates
rather
than
the
certificates
plus
the
russian
tax.
do
you
agree
with
that
analysis
as
a
matter
of
fact?
i
know
you
would
draw
a
different
inference,
but
can
we
accept
that
as
a
correct
interpretation?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
no,
it
is
a
very
helpful
answer
and
i
thank
you
for
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
not
you
more
accurately
say,
in
response
to
my
brother
rehnquist?s
question,
if
this
amounts
to
a
bounty
or
grant
then
he
has
no
discretion
whatsoever?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
further
say
that
as
a
matter
of
law
this
is
a
bounty
or
grant?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
we
do
not
need
to
win
that
argument,
though,
because
it
has
already
been
decided,
you
say,
whether
it
is
or
is
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
know
in
some
other
context,
sometimes
a
court
has
approved
a
decision
of
an
administrator
construing
a
statute
and
two
or
three
years
later
or
10
years
later
he
comes
back
with
a
different
construction
of
the
statute
and
he
gets
affirmed
here
then
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
has
always
got
as
the
words
of
the
statute
to
interpret
and
enforce
and
he
does
it
one
way
in
one
decade
and
another
way
in
another
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
as
far
as
the
statute
reads
he
has
no
role
in
determining
one
way
or
another?
