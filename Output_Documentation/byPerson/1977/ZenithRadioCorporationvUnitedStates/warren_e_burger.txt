we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
zenith
radio
corporation
against
the
united
states.
mr.
ikenson,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
is
it
possible
that
the
problem
was
regarded
as
so
delicate
and
difficult
that
they
would
rather
have
this
court
decide
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general,
would
you
prefer
to
begin
in
the
morning,
there
are
four
minutes
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
we
will
let
you
begin
at
10
o'clock
tomorrow
morning.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
arguments
in
zenith
radio
corporation
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
solicitor
general?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
itâ€™s
not
casual
in
an
written
language
as
it
is
quite
positive
and
repetitive
even?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
suggest
that
he
may
have
been
in
error,
but
he
was
not
the
author,
he
was
in
any
doubts
about
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
chavez
was
not
only
author,
there
were
eight
other
members
of
the
court
joined
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
prefer
to
say
that
the
secretary
has
consistently
ignored
the
language
of
downs?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general
i
assume
that
had
the
secretary
of
treasury
back
75
years
ago
after
downs
and
all
his
successors
since
then
had
taken
the
language
of
downs
literally,
the
language
that
you
describe
as
dictum
and
they
had
done
this
consistent
interpretation
pursunat
to
the
downs
case
and
congressional
acquiescence,
legislative
acquiescence
as
you
have
suggested
then
you
would
not
be
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
friend
would
have
prevailed
in
the
earlier
stage?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
solicitor
general.
mr.
ilenson.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
it
reasonably
arguable
that
not
meant
congress
was
satisfied
with
downs
to
the
extent
that
any
of
the
members
ever
give
it
any
thought
one
way
or
the?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
the
interpretation
of
downs
by
the
secretary,
i
do
not
mean
the
literal
language,
the
secretary's
interpretation
of
downs.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
were
satisfied
with
what
the
secretary
was
doing,
notwithstanding
this
explicifying
language
in
downs.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
77-539,
zenith
radio
corporation
against
the
united
states
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
marshall.
