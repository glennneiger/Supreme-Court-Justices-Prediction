mr.
mccree
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
presented
by
this
appeal
is
whether
the
inspection
provisions
of
the
act
and
their
implementing
regulations
that
authorize
representatives
of
the
secretary
of
labor
during
regular
working
hours
and
that
other
reasonable
times
and
within
reasonable
limits
and
in
a
reasonable
manner
to
conduct
warrantless
inspections
of
the
portions
of
commercial
premises
routinely
occupied
by
an
employer's
workforce
violate
the
fourth
amendment
guarantee
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures.
a
three-judge
court
held
that
provision
unconstitutional
and
we
submit
that
it
is
an
erroneous
holding
and
respectfully
request
this
court
to
reverse
it.
the
chronology
of
events
that
brings
this
matter
before
the
court
is
brief
and
as
follows.
on
september
11,
1975,
an
occupational
safety
and
health
inspector
called
for
a
routine
inspection
of
appellee's
premises
in
pocatello,
idaho.
these
premises
were
devoted
to
the
heating
and
cooling
business
and
he
sought
to
make
a
so-called
general
schedule
inspection,
a
term
now
superseded
and
called
a
regional
programmed
inspection.
that
is
to
say
the
inspection
was
not
in
response
to
any
complaint
by
an
employee
or
was
referenced
to
anything
other
than
a
determination
by
the
area
officer
that
this
kind
of
business
enterprise
would
be
inspected
within
this
community.
mr.
mccree
jr.
it
would
be
limited
to
the
premises,
the
work
premises,
occupied
by
barlow's
employees.
it
did
not
include
the
right
to
inspect
books
and
records.
and
it
would
be
limited
only
to
the
areas
routinely
occupied
and
only
during
working
hours
or
other
reasonable
times.
mr.
mccree
jr.
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
it's
just
a
change
of
name.
i
found
general
schedules
somewhat
difficult
to
comprehend
too
and
regional
programmed
inspection
indicates
that
what
has
happened
is
certain
geographical
areas
are
inspected
on
a
determination
that
as
the
labor
department
indicates,
the
worst
first
to
go
to
the
premises
that
contained
the
greatest
hazards
to
employee
safety
initially.
and
these
are
determined
by
reporting
schedules
from
programs
like
workmen's
compensation
programs
that
regularly
advise
about
the
incidents
of
industrial
accidents
and
other
disabling
occurrences.
mr.
mccree
jr.
yes,
if
the
court
please,
the
regional
officers
received
the
reports
to
which
i
made
reference
and
determine
then
which
industries
produce
the
greatest
number
of
industrial
injuries
and
occupational
disablements.
and
then
within
the
industries
where
geographically
they
may
be
located
and
the
schedules
are
determined
on
priorities
based
upon
considerations
such
as
that.
mr.
mccree
jr.
if
the
court
please,
there
is
a
--
there
is
a
publication
to
which
i'd
like
to
reference,
if
i
may.
i
--
i
do
not
have
it
at
fingertip.
i'll
have
it
when
i
return
to
the
lecture.
publication
that
i
suppose
is
discoverable,
thank
you,
by
any
interested
person.
it's
a
field
performance
evaluation
system
that
is
adopted
for
the
guidance
of
regional
programs
by
the
office
of
field
performance
evaluations
and
it
has
captioned
the
worst
first
program
scheduling
guide.
and
it
indicates
the
industries
which
will
first
be
inspected
on
the
basis
of
data
that
is
later
appearing
in
this
publication
indicating
the
nature
of
the
enterprise,
its
relative
rank
in
producing
disabling
accidents
and
other
occurrences,
the
number
of
employees,
the
number
of
establishments
and
so
forth.
and
so,
it
is
not
an
arbitrary
determination
at
all,
but
it
has
a
rational
basis
and
as
far
as
i
can
determine,
it's
available
for
inspection
by
persons
who
are
interested
in
knowing
when
their
turn
is
coming
about.
the
inspector
first
called
at
barlow's
on
september
11,
1975,
properly
identified
himself
by
producing
his
credentials
and
made
an
offer
of
a
toll-free
call
to
the
proprietor
who
was
present
on
the
premises
to
permit
him
to
ascertain
the
authenticity
of
the
inspector.
the
proprietor
denied
the
inspector
admission
for
the
purpose
of
making
the
inspection,
stating
that
he
believe
the
fourth
amendment
immunized
him
from
such
an
inspection
in
the
absence
of
a
search
warrant,
which
the
inspector
admitted
that
he
did
not
have.
mr.
mccree
jr.
we
do
concede.
we
concede
that
there
was
no
particular
rise
of
reason
for
inspecting
barlow's
premises.
we
suggest,
however,
that
on
the
basis
of
inspections,
administrative
inspections
being
authorized
where
a
reasonable
scheme
exists
for
inappropriate
governmental
--
to
serve
an
appropriate
governmental
interest
that
a
search
would
be
permitted
and
that
under
the
standards
of
camara
and
see,
an
inspection
warrant
would
have
been
issued
had
one
been
sought.
mr.
mccree
jr.
entry
was
refused,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
mccree
jr.
there
is
no
criminal
sanction
attached
to
that
nor
does
any
civil
penalty
result
there
from.
mr.
mccree
jr.
well,
the
secretary
has
adopted
a
regulation
that
provides
in
summary
that
the
area
and
assistant
regional
director
and
the
regional
solicitor
shall
promptly
take
appropriate
action
including
compulsory
process
if
necessary.
now,
as
a
matter
of
practice,
the
regional
inspectors
have
then
gone
to
the
courts
to
obtain
an
order
requiring
the
proprietor
to
submit
to
the
inspection.
and
indeed,
that
was
done
here
on
the
30th
of
december,
the
district
court
to
which
the
application
was
made
after
issuing
an
order
to
show
cause
to
which
barlow's
responded
with
counsel,
issued
an
order
requiring
entry
for
the
purpose
of
inspection.
mr.
mccree
jr.
that
is
essentially
the
representation
he
makes
to
the
court
and
the
court
in
this
case
issued
an
order
to
show
cause
which
permitted
the
employer
to
appear
and
assert
any
objection
he
might
have.
mr.
mccree
jr.
considerably
more
because
it's
an
adversary
proceeding
and
the
search
warrant
of
course
is
ex
parte.
mr.
mccree
jr.
i
obtained
--
well
if
the
court
please,
we've
suggested
that
a
reasonable
inspection
scheme
is
the
prerequisite
for
the
issuance
of
an
inspection
warrant.
mr.
mccree
jr.
an
inspection
warrant
--
mr.
mccree
jr.
or
an
inspection
warrant
under
camara
and
see.
a
particular
rise
of
probable
cause
isn't
required
under
the
standard
of
those
cases.
mr.
mccree
jr.
but
it
wasn't
necessary
--
mr.
mccree
jr.
but
if
this
had
an
application
been
made
for
a
search
warrant,
if
the
court
please,
we
suggest
that
that
would
have
been
the
representation
that
would
have
been
made
to
the
magistrate
ex
parte
and
he
would
have
issued
--
mr.
mccree
jr.
camara
and
see
type.
and
we
suggest
that
he
would
have
issued
a
search
warrant
then
for
the
premises
and
therefore,
this
procedure
of
requiring
an
order
to
--
of
issuing
an
order
to
show
cause
and
permitting
the
employer
to
appear
in
opposition
gave
the
employer
even
more
protection
than
this
court
said
the
fourth
amendment
mandates
in
a
camara
and
see
situation.
mr.
mccree
jr.
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
employer
did
say
that
he
was
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
that
his
premises
could
not
be
entered
for
that
reason
and
i
have
the
transcript
and
the
court
inquired
of
the
employer
whether
he
wanted
to
show
any
reason
why
he
shouldn't
come
in
response
to
it.
and
all
he
ever
said
was,
“no,
i
have
the
fourth
amendment.”
mr.
mccree
jr.
he
never
contended
that
there
was
no
rational
scheme
of
inspection
which
is
the
criterion
set
forth
in
camara
and
see
as
a
basis
for
the
issuance
of
a
search
warrant.
mr.
mccree
jr.
indeed,
that's
all
he
could
say
and
he
almost
said
that,
but
he
didn't
quite.
mr.
mccree
jr.
yes
indeed,
he
might
have.
he
did
not
in
fact.
mr.
mccree
jr.
oh,
we
don't
argue
that
at
all.
this
--
these
were
business
premises
and
the
portion
sought
to
be
entered
was
that
portion
routinely
occupied
by
the
employees.
it
wasn't
even
a
private
portion
of
the
business
firm.
mr.
mccree
jr.
oh,
it
did
not.
mr.
mccree
jr.
it
was
carefully
restricted
and
i
have
a
copy
of
the
order
here,
and
it
was
carefully
restricted
to
that
part
of
the
premises
occupied
by
the
employees
that
it'd
be
conducted
during
regular
working
hours
or
at
other
reasonable
times
within
reasonable
limits
and
a
reasonable
manner
and
it
incorporated
the
regulations
which
strictly
circumscribes.
mr.
mccree
jr.
the
statutory
provisions
and
the
regulations,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
mccree
jr.
no
and
they
troubled
except
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
authorize
district
courts
to
enter
prompt
to
issue
process
and
that
may
be
--
mr.
mccree
jr.
well
--
mr.
mccree
jr.
well
--
mr.
mccree
jr.
well,
that
has
disturbed
me
too.
i
suppose
the
federal
jurisdiction
statute
might
confer
on
the
court
jurisdiction
to
entertain
the
application.
mr.
mccree
jr.
well,
i
think
the
all
writs
act
is
really
in
support
of
jurisdiction
of
the
court
otherwise
posseses
and
i'd
be
bootstrapping
if
i
did
that.
mr.
mccree
jr.
yes,
i
think
i'd
have
to
rely
on
federal
question
jurisdiction
and
the
authority
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
to
issue
process.
mr.
mccree
jr.
no,
but
he
was
--
mr.
mccree
jr.
he
was
claiming
a
right
to
inspect
the
premises
under
an
act
--
mr.
mccree
jr.
or
under
a
statute,
a
federal
statute.
in
any
event,
on
the
30th
of
december,
the
district
court
entered
this
order
and
the
inspector
thereupon
reappeared
at
the
premises
and
requested
admission
pursuant
to
its
authority.
and
he
was
denied
permission
on
the
5th
of
january,
1976
and
thereafter,
appellee
filed
a
complaint
for
injunctive
relief
in
the
district
court.
he
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
and
the
three-judge
court
was
duly
designated
and
on
december
30,
1976,
the
three-judge
court
held
that
the
inspection
provision
was
unconstitutional
and
permanently
enjoined
the
secretary
from
proceeding
with
this
inspection.
and
that
brings
us
to
the
issue
--
brings
us
to
the
question
here
whether
the
fourth
amendment
forbids
inspections
as
authorized
by
the
statute
and
of
course,
our
initial
focus
is
upon
the
fourth
amendment.
as
this
court
has
said
many
times,
the
fourth
amendment
protects
a
privacy
interest
and
not
places,
and
the
issue
might
be
stated
whether
an
inspection
without
a
warrant
is
unreasonable
which
is
so
restricted
as
it
is
in
this
case.
and
we
suggest
that
this
depends
upon
a
determination
whether
the
protective
privacy
interest
at
stake
is
of
such
magnitude
and
the
authorized
entry,
so
significant
an
encroachment
on
that
interest
that
the
interposition
of
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate
should
be
required
in
the
absence
of
exigent
circumstances.
we
suggest
here
that
there
is
no
significant
privacy
interest
that
calls
for
the
issuance
of
a
warrant,
because
the
area
that's
to
be
searched
is
routinely
occupied
by
the
employees.
it's
during
working
hours
that
these
limitations
of
area
and
time
to
a
portion
of
the
premises
that
the
employer
has
opened
up
to
his
own
employees
indicates
the
absence
of
a
privacy
interest
such
as
would
require
a
warrant
as
a
precondition
for
entry.
mr.
mccree
jr.
oh,
i
would
certainly
not
deny
that
there
would
be
a
relationship
between
the
employer
and
his
employee.
but
when
the
employer
opens
up
to
his
employees,
certain
portions
of
his
business
premises,
he
also
surrenders
his
exclusive
control
of
it,
at
least
and
so
far
as
it
affects
certain
of
those
employee's
interest.
for
example,
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
these
employees
may
speak
to
persons
who
seek
to
organize
them
for
the
purposes
of
collective
bargaining
and
he
may
not
exclude
them
when
they
come
into
those
portions
of
his
premises
at
certain
times
in
any
event.
mr.
mccree
jr.
and
indeed
if
he
should
do
that,
this
inspector
could
not
enter
then
because
he
must
enter
during
regular
working
hours
and
just
those
areas
routinely
occupied.
and
he
has
not
the
authority
under
the
statute
without
a
particularized
showing
to
do
that.
mr.
mccree
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
mccree
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
sum
of
the
government's
argument
in
this
case
can
be
found
in
an
expression
of
this
court
in
1945,
in
a
case
captioned
marsh
versus
alabama
involving
a
company
town,
an
institution
that
this
court
has,
on
a
later
date,
characterized
fortunately
as
an
economic
anachronism.
in
that
case,
this
court
stated,
“the
more
an
owner,
for
his
advantage
opens
up
his
property
for
use
by
the
public
in
general,
the
more
do
his
rights
become
circumscribed
by
the
statutory
and
constitutional
rights
of
those
who
use
it.”
and
we
submit
that
occupational
safety
and
health
inspections
intrude
upon
an
employer's
premises
only
to
the
degree
that
he
has
opened
those
premises
to
employees
for
his
own
advantage.
and
the
purposes
of
the
inspections
are
directly
related
to
the
safety
of
those
employees,
and
there
are
safeguards
in
the
statute
and
in
the
regulations
to
assure
that
the
inspections
are
performed
only
for
their
intended
purpose.”
mr.
mccree
jr.
i
do
not.
mr.
mccree
jr.
only
if
--
certainly
not
over
the
employer's
refusal
to
accord
it
to.
as
a
practical
manner,
many
employers
do.
vendors
come
on
at
lunch
hours
and
sell
sandwiches,
beverages
and
so
forth.
many
employers
do
this
with
their
regular
working
premises,
but
i'm
not
speaking
of
that
situation.
mr.
mccree
jr.
i
would
think
so.
of
course,
marsh,
as
i
recall
it,
was
a
case
where
religious
literature
was
being
distributed
on
the
premises
and
we're
not
even
seeking
an
intrusion
of
that
extent
because
we
suggest
that
this
is
even
more
restrictive
but
30
years
ago,
the
court
recognized
that
when
a
person
allows
someone
else
to
use
his
property,
he
gives
up
an
expectation
of
privacy
at
least
congruent
with
that
person's
rights
or
some
of
his
rights.
and
we
suggest
here
that
where
the
safety
of
the
employees
who
are
gathered
on
the
premises
for
his
advantage
is
a
legitimate
concern
of
the
congress
as
expressed
in
this
legislation
that
these
inspections
do
not
therefore
intrude
upon
any
privacy
interest
of
the
business,
and
that
no
warrant
should
be
required
to
permit
an
inspection
to
see
that
this
public
interest
is
carried
out.
mr.
mccree
jr.
there
are
--
mr.
mccree
jr.
i'm
--
i'm
quite
aware
of
that.
mr.
mccree
jr.
well,
of
course
the
--
mr.
mccree
jr.
the
shopping
--
the
shopping
centers
are
not
to
refer
again
to
the
phrase
i
used
before
the
economic
anachronism
that
the
company
town
is.
there,
the
recurrent
waive
and
i
can
refer,
however,
to
the
cases
that
are
recognized
in
the
labor
field
that
i
made
reference
to
before
the
recess,
where
for
organizational
purposes,
under
limited
circumstances,
access
could
be
held
on
premises
that
are
less
public
than
shopping
centers
or
shopping
malls
which
have
eroded
some
of
the
renouncement
of
marsh.
mr.
mccree
jr.
indeed.
mr.
mccree
jr.
yes.
we
believe
--
thank
you
mr.
justice.
we
believe
that
reasonableness
in
the
light
of
the
limited
nature
of
the
employer's
interest
in
the
portion
of
his
premises
that
he
opens
up
routinely
to
his
employees
is
manifest
under
these
circumstances,
and
that
this
legislation
is
constitutional
and
that
the
judgment
of
the
three-judge
court
should
be
reversed.
mr.
mccree
jr.
we
believe
that
he
may
go
--
that
he
may
insist
upon
going
in.
we
commend
the
labor
secretary
for
providing
in
his
regulations
that
he
seeks
a
court
order
in
order
to
avoid
a
breach
of
the
peace.
mr.
mccree
jr.
we
contend
that
he
did
not
have
to
do
that.
mr.
mccree
jr.
we
believe
that
the
constitution
--
that
the
congress
has
authorized
him
to
do
that.
mr.
mccree
jr.
but
we
would
hope
that
he
would
not
do
it
as
a
matter
of
policy
except
in
the
extreme
circumstance
that
the
court
has
to
do.
mr.
mccree
jr.
we
believe
the
congress
has
given
that
authority.
mr.
mccree
jr.
we
do
not
rely
on
the
regulation
for
our
constitutional
argument.
mr.
mccree
jr.
nor
on
the
court
order.
with
leave
of
court,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
mccree
jr.
i
would
think
not,
if
the
court
please,
and
i
would
amplify
my
answer
by
pointing
out
that
the
secretary
by
regulation
forbids
the
inspectors
to
search
for
matters
other
than
those
set
forth
in
the
regulation.
i
think
i
can
furnish
the
court
that
regulation.
mr.
mccree
jr.
i
would
think
not.
i
would
think
the
fact
that
they
were
predominantly
mexican
wouldn't
necessary
suggest
that
their
alien
age
was
other
than
the
american
citizen.if
their
citizenship
was
other
than
the
american
citizenship,
certainly
wouldn't
betray
it
to
me.
mr.
mccree
jr.
if
the
court
please,
there
is
a
regulation
that
forbids
the
inspector
from
doing
just
that
and
i
would
expect
them
to
abide
by
the
regulation.
their
--
their
inquiry
is
limited
to
conditions
affecting
the
safety
and
health
of
the
workforce.
we
would
conclude,
if
the
court
please,
by
suggesting
that
there
are
two
steps
to
our
argument.
first,
whether
the
inspection
is
reasonable
and
we
think
in
camara,
this
court
has
indicated
that
area
searches
and
things
like
area
searches
under
proper
legislative
pronouncements
are
reasonable.
and
then,
of
course,
the
question
becomes
whether
a
warrant,
an
inspection
warrant
is
required
and
in
biswell,
this
court
told
us
something
about
the
purpose
of
that.
it
suggested
that
a
major
protection
was
little
of
any
threat
to
the
effectiveness
of
the
inspection
system
there
at
issue
could
be
forwarded
by
an
inspection
warrant.
now,
whether
this
major
protection
overbalances
the
effectiveness
of
the
inspection
systems
seems
to
be
the
issue.
and
here,
the
unannounced
inspect
--
inspection
is
a
critical
part
of
the
statutory
scheme
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
biswell.
very
little
would
be
gained
by
not
requiring
for
the
effectiveness
of
the
system
by
not
--
let
me
rephrase
that.
that
the
inspection
system
in
biswell
would
not
--
or
in
see
--
in
see
would
not
be
impaired
by
requiring
an
inspection
warrant,
because
structural
defects
in
the
buildings
would
be
relatively
long
standing
and
relatively
difficult
to
change
easily
and
then
made
it
in
biswell
that
if
notice
went
to
the
gun
dealer
that
the
person
contemplated
an
inspection,
he
would
remove
the
--
he
might
remove
the
contraband
from
his
presence.
mr.
mccree
jr.
if
the
court
please,
he
first
instructs
his
inspector
to
seek
entry
--
mr.
mccree
jr.
--
without
notice
and
they're
even
cohobations.
mr.
mccree
jr.
if
the
court
please,
there
are
regulations
which
forbid
giving
advance
notice
of
the
intent
to
inspect,
and
they're
even
penalties
on
the
employees
who
are
disclosing
the
intention
of
inspecting.
so,
it's
really
not
his
purpose.
the
regulation
as
the
court
appropriately
points
out
does
afford
notice
once
the
court
has
asked
to
issue
such
an
order.
that
is
the
rare
case.
that
is
the
case
where
he's
been
turned
down
and
we
hope
this
court's
ruling
today
will
make
and
necessary
to
do
it.
mr.
mccree
jr.
it
is
--
it
is
the
real
the
case
that
he's
denied
the
right
and
we
hope
if
this
court
upholds
the
statutory
scheme,
it
will
be
even
rarer.
mr.
mccree
jr.
well,
the
--
the
statute
has
not
provided
a
sanction
and
then
we
suspect
the
secretary,
again,
would
direct
his
inspector
or
he
would
threw
his
inspector,
go
to
court
to
get
an
order
so
that
he
might
use
the
power
of
the
court
to
uphold
the
law
and
then,
of
course,
the
contempt
citation
would
be
sought
if
he
refuse
to
obey
it.
but
that
happens
in
other
situations
so
it
doesn't
necessarily
frustrate
the
inspection
scheme.
mr.
mccree
jr.
well,
i
--
i
think
he
is
in
the
case
of
recalcitrant
persons.
i
have
the
belief
that
we're
a
nation
of
law
abiding
people
and
then
if
this
court
issues
its
pronouncement,
that
employers
across
the
country
will
abide
by
it.
mr.
mccree
jr.
there
are
certainly
parallels.
i
suppose,
a
person
could
perhaps
adjust
a
questionable
entry
in
ledger
just
as
easily
as
he
could
turn
on
a
switch
in
a
ventilating
booth
and
a
painting
or
ventilating
fan
and
a
painting
booth.
mr.
mccree
jr.
well,
if
the
court
please,
i
think
the
congress
has
had
more
experience
with
regulating
banking
enterprises
than
it
has
safety
and
health
which
is
an
important
matter
in
the
nation's
agenda
of
affairs
that
it's
just
adverted
to
recently.
mr.
mccree
jr.
of
course
there
are,
your
honor.
mr.
mccree
jr.
that
--
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
mccree
jr.
well,
that
presents
a
much
more
difficult
question.
this
court
is
--
mr.
mccree
jr.
well,
my
argument
might
not
be
the
same
because
this
court
is
for
a
long
time
recognized
that
the
very
core
of
the
interest
to
privacy
is
the
residence
of
a
person.
this
is
not
the
residence
of
a
person.
this
is
a
business
enterprise
entered
into
for
profit
that
affects
commerce
and
that
benefits
only
because
persons,
not
members,
necessarily
members
of
his
household,
despite
the
fact
that
they
have
a
special
relationship
within,
are
brought
into
his
premises
for
his
benefit.
and
we
believe
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
and
its
interest
for
the
well-being
of
the
people
can
look
to
their
safety
and
welfare
by
having
restricted
searches,
inspections,
if
you
will,
limited
to
see
that
every
american
employee
will
have
a
safe
place
to
work
free
from
hazards
that
might
be
prevented.
mr.
mccree
jr.
i
would
not
at
all
and
the
absence
of
--
mr.
mccree
jr.
because
the
congress
has
made
a
legislative
determination.
mr.
mccree
jr.
well,
the
congress
can
legitimize
certain
things
by
its
legislative
act,
so
long
as
it's
consistent
with
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
and
the
fourth
amendment
may
forbid
this
kind
of
inspection
of
a
private
residence
--
the
interest
of
the
public,
isn't
that
great.
and
i
can
see
when
we
get
in
the
residence
is
it
might
do
this
for
multiple
welfare
for
large
apartment
buildings
where
there
are
public
areas
or
where
there
are
areas
not
within
the
control
of
the
householder.
but
we
haven't,
that
case
here.
mr.
mccree
jr.
i
would
think
so
--
mr.
mccree
jr.
i
would
think
so,
but
they're
open
generally
to
the
--
to
the
public,
i
suspect,
to
delivery
persons
and
so
forth.
and
again,
i
say
that
more
person
relinquishes
exclusive
control
of
an
area,
the
less
becomes
his
privacy
interest
that
is
to
be
protected
there.
and
that
is
not
true
with
the
home.
