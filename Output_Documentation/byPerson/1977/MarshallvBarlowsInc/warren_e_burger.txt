chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
hear
arguments
next
in
76-1143,
secretary
of
labor
against
barlow.
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
think
you
may
proceed
now,
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
indicate
briefly,
mr.
solicitor
general,
the
scope
of
that
inspection,
that
is
--
does
it
go
just
the
machinery
or
books,
records
and
files?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
you
would
concede,
mr.
solicitor
general,
in
this
setting,
the
search
warrant
could
not
have
been
had
on
any
specific
--
any
probable
cause?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
isn't
there
a
certain
degree
of
brevity
between
an
employer
and
his
employees
that
doesn't
exists
with
the
employer
and
the
world
at
large
or
the
government
at
large?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
under
certain
circumstances,
he's
entire
legal
right
to
shut
the
plant
down
and
close
it
and
exclude
everybody
including
the
employees?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
later
at
one
o'clock,
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general
you
may
resume
if
you
wish.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don't
suggest
that
the
member
of
the
public
or
the
public
at
large
has
any
access
to
these
premises,
do
you
mr.
solicitor
general?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
a
person
can't
just
walk
in
off
the
street
and
say,
“i'd
like
to
look
at
your
plant.”
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
our
company
town
situation,
there
was
really
a
much
more
access
by
the
public.
generally,
wouldn't
you
say
then
there
is
an
ordinary
industrial
plant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
what
we
call
it
glass
summit.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
solicitor
general.
mr.
runft?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
use
the
words
search?
is
this
a
search
or
an
inspection?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
wonder
if
that's
your
views
of
the
term.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
that
supposed
the
application
for
the
warrant
presided
that
the
accident
rate
was
three
times
the
rate
of
all
other
comparable
people
using
the
same
kind
of
machinery
that
produce
the
same
kind
of
goods
in
that
area.
would
you
think
that
would
meet
whatever
probable
cause
standards
you
suggest
are
necessary?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
about
camara?
camara
didn't
require
that,
did
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
trying
to
test
out
this
showing
on
getting
a
warrant.
supposed
the
government
had
information
as
to
the
total
production
of
the
particular
paint
factory,
from
whatever
source,
and
then
it
could
observed
from
the
outside
that
it
had
only
x
number
of
ventilating
vents
with
fans
to
take
off
the
obnoxious
and
dangerous
fumes
have
gone
run
in
and
reciting
these
subjective
facts
and
reciting
the
standard
that
this
was
only
25%
of
the
necessary
means
of
protecting
the
health
of
the
people
inside
that
plant
from
the
obnoxious
fumes,
lead
poisoning,
do
you
think
they
could
issue
a
warrant
on
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
say
that's
the
kind
of
evidence,
objective
evidence
that
the
government
must
furnish
in
order
to
make
the
inspection.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general,
may
i
ask
you
a
question.
suppose
the
immigration
service
asked
the
osha
people
to
let
run
the
immigration
officials
go
along
with
them
and
let's
say
in
the
southwestern
states
where
illegal
aliens
or
whatever
states
illegal
aliens
with
not
to
be
most
frequently
working.
and
then
acting
on
his
observations,
checked
on
the
blue
card
or
green
card
whatever
it
is
the
illegal
entity
--
the
legal
aliens
must
have
from
employment,
would
you
think
that
would
be
permitted
under
this
procedure?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
without
searching,
the
inspector,
osha
inspector
observed
that
predominantly
they
were
mexican,
americans,
let
us
say,
or
any
other
alien
group
who
could
not
speak
english
as
he
would
observe
objectively,
first
hand.
could
you
report
that
to
the
immigration
or
the
fbi?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
my
point
is
not
whether
it
is
true,
but
rather
they
may
report
that
objective
fact
which
they
observe
that
90%
of
the
employees
were
appeared
to
be
mexican-americans,
or
cubans
and
90%
of
them
could
not
respond
to
questions
put
to
them
in
english.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
your
view
and
the
government's
view,
i
suppose
the
unannounced
investigation
is
parallel
to
the
unannounced
investigation
that
the
bank
examiners,
for
example,
make?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
banking
laws
do
prevent
some
sanctions
for
banks
who
--
if
they
turned
--
turned
away
a
bank
examiner,
do
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
most
of
those
--
so
if
an
apartment
building
are
now
doing
inspection
about
fire
inspectors,
are
they
not
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
just
generally,
everywhere?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
justice
white
has
opinions
in
two
cases
to
announce.
