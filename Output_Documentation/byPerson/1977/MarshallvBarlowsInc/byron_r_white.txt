justice

r.
white
but
along
with
your
facts,
i
take
it
that
the
entry
was
refused?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
is
--
that
is
not
a
crime
or
illegal,
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
does
the
regulation
say
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
does
the
united
--
what
does
the
united
states
--
what
does
the
inspector
submit
to
the
court
to
get
such
an
order?
just
as
he
--
just
make
the
presentation
such
as
you
did
that
there
is
a
reasonable
inspection
scheme
and
the
statute
permits
it
and
we
want
to
get
in?
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
is
more
than
the
equivalent
of
a
search
warrant
if
you
could've
gotten
a
search
warrant
on
this
for
this
reason?
justice
byron
r.
white
camara
and
see
type.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
under
--
what
under
your
submission
could
the
employer
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
under
your
submission,
that's
about
all
what
he
could
say?
i
don't
-
there
is
no
such
plan
as
this
or
something
like
that
but
beyond
a
part
from
that
sort
of
thing,
all
he
could
say
was
this
isn't
a
reason
or
reasonable
inspection
program
under
you
submission.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
don't
take
it
that
--
you
don't
say
that
the
authored
--
the
court
authorization
would
authorize
entry
in
any
other
part
of
the
premises?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
searching
a
desk
or
anything
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor
general,
where
did
the
district
court
get
jurisdiction
to
enter
that
order?
what's
the
source
of
this?
and
no
statute
authorized
the
district
court
had
orders
to
show
cause,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
then
initially
is
this
process,
this
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
did
this
order
gave
the
inspector
any
greater
authority
than
the
statute
itself
gave
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
one
question.
the
second
question
is
where
does
united
states
district
court
get
the
authority
to
enter
such
an
unusual
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
relying
on
the
all
writs
act
as
the
court
did
on
the
telephone
case
the
other
day?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
as
the
court
did
the
other
day.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
even
enter.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
he
has
to
have
some
suspicion
that
there
is
a
violation?
or
i
gather
you
say
he
doesn't
even
have
to
have
that,
did
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
i
take
it
then
there
will
be
some
industries
that's
low
into
the
scale
that
they
can
enter
without
traditional
probable
cause?
justice
byron
r.
white
supposed,
the
statute
had
expressly
given
a
court
jurisdiction
to
issue
some
sort
of
a
piece
of
paper,
a
search
warrant
or
something
or
an
inspection
warrant
and
that
--
before
you
even
go
the
premises.
now,
suppose
that
the
statute
have
provided
that
and
the
piece
of
paper
issued
in
this
case
just
on
the
same
information
that
the
court
order
issued
in
this
case,
would
you
think
that
was
enough?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
--
what
was
the
shortcoming
of
the
submission
to
the
court
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
just
relied
on
the
statute
straight
up?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
required
no
more
than
a
showing
of
the
rational
area
inspection
program.
am
i
correct?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
hear
you
have
a
statute
that
purports
to
a
--
to
be
concerned
with
the
health
and
safety
of
conditions
in
all
plants
all
over
the
united
states
with
certain
demand
of
exceptions.
it's
not
roomed,
not
confined
to
a
certain
industry.
if
--
if
you
had
a
statute
that
were
concerned
with
the
steel
industry,
i
say,
and
then
somebody,
a
government
inspector
said,
“i
want
to
inspect
this
sausage
plant,”
that
would
be
unreasonable.
but
under
this
statute,
why
isn't
any
inspection,
that's
a
rational
program
reasonable
in
light
of
the
camara
case?
and
why
therefore
couldn't
a
warrant
be
secured
in
any
--
in
a
case
in
the
light
of
the
camara
standard?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
mr.
solicitor
general,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
secretary
here
with
these
regulations
has
indicated
that
--
that
--
well,
we'll
just
give
him
notice
and
he
instructed
his
inspectors
that
if
he
refused
entry,
don't
break
in
and
take
advantage
of
a
--
of
an
unannounced
entry,
we'll
have
to
go
to
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
he
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
then
he
--
but
then
he
permits
him
to
be
turned
away
and
tells
him
that
he
is
turned
away
to
go
to
--
to
go
to
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
is
the
rare
case
when
he
has
turned
--
it
is
the
rare
case
that
he's
turned
down
and
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
if
--
what
if
the
court
upholds
that
the
--
and
the
person
who
--
the
owner
of
the
business
establishment
tells
--
still
says,
“don't
come
in,”
and
he's
still
not
subject
to
any
sanction?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
we
--
if
we
agree
with
you
--
if
we
agree
with
you,
the
secretary
is
left
indecisive
with
the
positioning
he
is
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
first
of
these
cases
is
marshall,
secretary
of
labor
against
barlow's
inc.
the
section
8
(a)
of
the
occupational
safety
and
health
act
purports
to
authorize
the
inspection
of
most
of
the
covered,
of
all
the
covered
business
establishments
without
a
warrant
and
without
probable
cause
to
believe
that
there
is
a
violation
of
the
act.
a
three-judge
district
court
for
the
district
of
idaho
concluded
that
in
this
respect
the
act
was
unconstitutional
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
secretary
brought
the
case
here
by
appeal.
we
agree
with
the
district
court
that
for
all
intents
and
purposes
the
issue
is
controlled
by
two
cases
decided
in
this
court
a
few
years
ago,
camara
against
municipal
court
and
see
against
seattle
and
as
construed
and
applied
in
those
cases,
the
fourth
amendment
as
we
have
concluded,
forbids
the
kinds
of
searches
of
that
this
act
purports
to
authorize.
accordingly,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
and
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
and
he
is
joined
by
justices
blackmun
and
rehnquist.
mr.
justice
brennan
took
no
part
in
the
decision
or
consideration
of
the
case.
