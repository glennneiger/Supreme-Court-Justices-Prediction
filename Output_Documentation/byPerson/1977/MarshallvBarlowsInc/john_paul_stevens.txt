marsh
was
a
constitutional
case
and
the
question
was
whether
or
not
the
company
town
there
was
the
equivalent
of
government.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it's
been
-
that
hasn't
been
questioned
since.
the
only
question
is
whether
shopping
centers
is
the
equivalent
of
a
government,
and
that's
irrelevant
to
your
argument
into
this
case.
this
is
a
statutory
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
solicitor
general,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
what
you
understand
the
statute
means
and
if
an
employer
denies
access,
the
statute
says
that
the
agent
has
a
right
to
enter
without
delay.
do
you
interpret
that
as
meaning
he
can
insist
on
going
in
without
delay
or
does
he
have
to
go
to
court
first?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
--
you
commend
them
but
he
didn't
really
have
to
do
that,
did
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
does
that
mean
that
if
--
if
the
refusal
--
there
is
a
refusal
to
enter,
under
the
statute,
the
agent
could
force
his
way
in
if
he
had
to.
if
he
thought
there
was
something
dangerous
that
might
be
hidden
if
he
didn't
look
at
it
right
away,
you
make
the
argument
that
there's
need
for
unannounced
inspection
to
find
out
what's
really
happening?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
as
a
matter
of
policy
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
the
agent
thought
it
was
really
a
very
dangerous
situation,
it
might
go?
it
might
be
not
found
out
that
he
could
go
right
in?
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct,
thank
you.
rely
at
all
on
the
regulation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
nor
just
to
make
it
completely,
nor
on
the
court
order?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
runft,
before
you
get
to
that
case,
just
so
i
follow
your
argument
correctly.
what
is
your
position
as
to
the
showing
that
would
be
required
in
order
to
get
a
warrant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
to
the
probable
cause,
as
to
the
particular
business
establishment
or
the
probable
cause
to
believe
that
some
businesses
like
this
maybe
dangerous.
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
submission
is
that
there
is
no
right
on
the
part
of
the
government
and
inspector
to
enter
without
probable
cause
to
believe
there
was
some
violation
of
the
statute
within
the
premises,
that's
your
submission?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
your
submission,
that's
not
quite
that
extreme
you
want
to
make?
