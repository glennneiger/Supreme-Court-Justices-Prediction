mr.
john
l.
runft
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
open
by
going
directly
to
a
question,
asked
my
friend,
the
solicitor,
by
chief
justice
burger
with
regard
to
the
degree
of
brevity
found
here
in
the
relationship
between
the
employer
and
the
employee.
it
seems
to
me
in
essence
here
that
the
secretary
of
labor
is
attempting
to
state
the
department
has
the
right
to
come
into
the
premises
involved
here,
so
to
speak
on
the
back
of
the
employees.
now,
the
commerce
clause
in
the
constitution
does
give
congress
the
power
to
regulate
commerce
and
perhaps
to
the
extent
there
are
employees
in
a
work
premises.
there
is
then
a
commensurate
right
as
congress
so
found
to
inspect,
but
that
is
not
the
same
thing
as
saying,
“they
have
the
right
to
inspect
without
a
warrant.”
there's
a
distinction
here
and
i
submit.
mr.
john
l.
runft
or
even
enter,
or
even
enter.
inspection,
the
question
of
entry,
of
course,
is
i
submit
a
separate
question,
one
dealing
with
probable
cause.
but
the
--
i
believe
that
the
point
here
to
be
made
initially
for
opening
is
this,
that
throughout
the
presentation
and
throughout
the
brief
of
the
united
states,
there
is
a
constant
shifting
back
and
forth
between
the
question
--
between
the
issue,
i
should
say,
of
the
power
to
inspect
to
the
commerce
clause
and
the
right
to
enter
without
a
warrant.
now,
the
--
i
would
like
to
go
directly
from
that
with
regard
to
this
--
to
this
question
of
a
warrant.
to
what
the
court
has
stated
in
its
cases
is
necessary
to
determine
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
warrant
is
necessary
and
of
course
the
leading
case
here
is
the
camara
case.
now
--
mr.
john
l.
runft
i
believe,
justice
stevens,
that
there
would
have
to
be
a
showing
of
probable
cause
as
set
forth
and
as
detailed
in
the
camara
case.
mr.
john
l.
runft
i
believe
they
would
have
--
there
would
have
to
be,
in
any
case,
some
showing
as
to
the
particular
business
even,
for
example,
in
the
case
part
in
camara,
where
you
have
an
area,
an
area
inspection.
now,
you
have
an
area
inspection,
questions
could
be
asked
as
to
the
particular
building
as
to
when
it
was
built.
if
it
were
found
out
that
it
was
not
built
at
the
same
time,
say
more
recently
than
all
the
other
buildings
in
this
blighted
area
--
mr.
john
l.
runft
it
is
my
submission,
justice
stevens,
but
i
do
hold
that
there
is
a
middle
ground.
i'm
trying
to
bring
out
at
least
--
mr.
john
l.
runft
yes,
not
as
extreme
as
in
the
camara
case,
perhaps.
but
there
must
be
--
it
is
our
--
it
is
our
position,
our
submission
to
the
court
that
in
every
case,
in
order
for
the
secretary
of
labor
to
enter,
there
must
be
some
connection,
some
rational
connection
between
the
statute
and
that
particular
place
of
business,
that
particular
working
environment.
mr.
john
l.
runft
well,
i
believe
the
suspicion
might
arise
from
some
or
the
factors
such
as
the
nature
of
the
industry,
such
as
the
industry
wide
accident
rate,
for
example,
such
as,
perhaps,
complaints
of
workmen
and
so
on.
the
suspicion,
as
one
would
call
it,
does
not
have
to
be
specific
as
to
that
industry,
directly
as
to
any
particular
time.
that's
what
i'm
saying.
in
other
words,
there
are
cases,
quite
a
number
of
cases,
justice
white
recently.
i've
got
quite
a
list
of
them
here
that
i
can
submit
to
the
court
that
have
taken
the
position
that
government
findings,
industry
wise,
such
as
in
nep,
the
national
emphasis
program
in
osha,
will
suffice
to
form
probable
cause
for
entry,
say,
into
a
steel
manufacturing
plant
or
into
a
casting
plant.
mr.
john
l.
runft
i
would
say,
that
would
be
a
question.
that
would
be
the
very
question
that
should
be
determined
by
a
magistrate
as
to
what
is
the
reasonable
nature,
what
is
the
reasonableness
here
of
this
probable
cause
to
be
shown.
in
other
words,
is
there
probable
cause
based
on
a
national
emphasis
program
or
a
worst
first
program,
and
if
there
are
facts
available
in
a
particular
case,
how
do
they
relate
to
the
general
facts
presented
by
the
secretary
of
labor?
specifically,
the
issue
is,
i
believe
here,
in
fact
the
fundamental
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
we
need
to
have
a
magistrate,
an
independent
magistrate
here
to
make
this
decision.
i
think
that
really
is
the
fundamental
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
john
l.
runft
i
would
not.
mr.
john
l.
runft
the
shortcoming
of
the
submission
to
the
court
in
this
case,
justice
white,
was
simply
that
the
united
states
attorney
presented
the
fact
that
the
barlow
establishment
was
an
employer,
the
workers
are
employee
there
and
that
it
fell
into
the
jurisdiction
of
osha,
that
was
the
--
mr.
john
l.
runft
truly
on
the
statute,
that's
all.
we
claim
that
it's
insufficient
and
of
course,
the
burden
is
extremely
great.
i
mean,
the
difference
is
extremely
great
between
statute
showing
and
a
showing
of
probable
causing
wherein
this
case
perhaps
an
accident
rate,
industry
wide,
might
have
been
shown
if
there
indeed
are
figures
for
these
types
of
small
business.
any
other
showing
to
lay
the
ground
work
for
this
inspection
to
show
if
there
are
some
rational
connection
between
the
purposes
of
the
statute
and
the
need
of
a
government
to
inspect.
it
is
--
it
is
a
preservation
of
that
rationale,
that
link
that
we
call
for
the
interposition
of
a
magistrate.
mr.
john
l.
runft
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
reason
there,
justice
marshall,
if
i
may
say,
is
that
in
the
ex
parte
hearing,
there
is
still
the
requirement
that
they
must
make
a
probable
cost
showing
this.
they
still
must
confirm
with
these
standards.
mr.
john
l.
runft
one
can
move
across
the
warrant
later.
now,
that
does
bring
of
another
interesting
question
which
--
or
another
issue
which
is
apparent
throughout
the
briefs
here
of
the
government,
and
that
is
they
say
that
there
would
be
--
the
government
would
be
terribly
disadvantaged
if
it
was
faced
with
the
warrant
requirement.
now,
would
it
really?
they
claim
that
it
would
give
notice
to
the
--
to
the
employers
that
there
would
be
a
search,
but
indeed,
dozen
depressant
compulsory
process
gave
notice,
gives
as
much
as
a
warrant,
well
in
fact
that
warrant
will
give
less
notice,
you
could
follow
an
ex
parte
obtaining
of
a
warrant.
mr.
john
l.
runft
mr.
chief
justice,
i
take
the
position
that
--
and
i
believe
the
court
has
stated
that
this
is
anonymous.
it
is
a
search
in
the
--
mr.
john
l.
runft
yes,
i
use
them
anonymously.
and
the
--
mr.
john
l.
runft
i
supposed
--
you
mean
once
you
get
into
the
building?
mr.
john
l.
runft
well,
in
this
particular
--
mr.
john
l.
runft
yes,
there
is.
mr.
john
l.
runft
if
i
could
refer
the
court
to
exhibit
a
of
the
appellee's
brief,
we've
set
forth
as
exhibit
a,
the
compulsory
order
of
the
court
in
idaho.
and
--
mr.
john
l.
runft
i
see.
mr.
john
l.
runft
that
is
correct
justice
marshall.
mr.
john
l.
runft
yes.
those
regulations
however,
i
may
add,
are
procedural
regulations
as
to
how
the
inspection
should
be
conducted
and
i
wish
to
point
out
that
they
are
not
safeguards
of
the
type
that
would
--
or
criteria
that
would
land
themselves
to
explaining
why
a
search
should
be
conducted
in
that
particular
premises.
there
would
be
--
there
is
no
way
in
those
regulations
or
in
the
statute
itself
to
determine
any
standards
that
would
justify
any
particular
search.
what
we
really
have
here,
if
i
could
submit
to
the
court,
what
i
really
have
here
in
these
acts
and
the
way
it's
being
enforced
without
warrants,
is
a
form
or
legislative
probable
cause.
the
issue
is
really
one
of
separation
of
powers
i
submit.
the
--
the
brief,
as
you
know,
actually
comes
to
the
conclusion
that
the
presence
of
a
magistrate
is
unneeded
in
these
circumstances
and
in
the
reply
brief,
in
fact
that
the
physiology
is
used,
i
believe
the
intervention
of
a
magistrate
or
of
a
judge
is
not
required
in
the
administrative
search.
and
that
particular
reference
is
to
be
found
on
page
two
of
the
reply
brief.
now
--
mr.
john
l.
runft
yes.
it
may,
it
depends
as
far
as
procedurally,
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
l.
runft
well
i
believe
ti
would
be
on
this,
justice
stewart,
because
the
secretary
would
have
to
carry
the
burden
of
making
a
probable
cause
showing
--
mr.
john
l.
runft
if
i
may,
in
answer
to
that,
it
may
not
be
enough.
it
may
be
enough
in
some
circumstances
and
it
may
not
in
other
circumstances,
and
i
think
it
is
those
circumstances
--
mr.
john
l.
runft
well,
for
example.
i
can
give
you
an
example
of
the
shellcast
case
and
that's
a
case
that
the
alabama
--
it
took
place
in
alabama.
it's
marshall
versus
the
shellcast
corporation.
it's
civil
number
77p0995e
and
was
decided
on
july
26
of
this
year.
in
that
case,
the
secretary
came
into
a
foundry
to
make
an
inspection
according
to
an
nep,
national
emphasis
program
into
the
foundry
industry.
the
statistics
of
the
nep
program
were
developed
in
the
year
1973,
and
this
of
course,
took
place
in
1976,
this
inspection
or
attended
inspection.
the
court
asked
the
question
of
whether
there
was
any
specific
information
available
or
easily
attainable.
and
apparently,
although
it's
not
clear
in
the
record
exactly
what
sort
of
information
it
was,
there
were
specific
statistics
available.
and
under
those
circumstances,
where
there
were
subsequent
statistics
showing
that
the
accident
rate
in
this
particular
establishment
were
considerably
less
--
mr.
john
l.
runft
this
--
well
no,
in
this
particular
establishment.
these
were
--
these
were
available
in
--
as
regard
to
this
particular
establishment.
and
for
that
reason,
the
court
refused
to
grant
the
search
warrant
or
the
inspection
warrant.
mr.
john
l.
runft
what
i
understand,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
that
warrant
regarding
this
aggravated
accident
rate
referred
specifically
to
the
entity
that
was
to
be
searched.
i
would
say
that
would
be
strong,
much
stronger.
that
will
be
the
abscess
situation
and
be
much
stronger
to
support
probable
cause,
yes.
but
i
believe
these
cases
and
these
cases
are
varied
and
really
very
fascinating
as
to
what
the
court
in
the
district
courts
throughout
the
land
really
are
doing
with
the
--
with
the
camara
test.
they
are
adhering
on
one
hand
to
the
idea
brought
out
in
camara
of
the
areas
searched
or
the
nep
type
thing
or
perhaps
the
worst
first
type
of
approach.
but
still
saying,
we
can
still
look
to
and
if
there
are
available
demands
that
individual
circumstances
be
brought
to
the
court.
for
example,
osha
has
several
forms.
forms
--
mr.
john
l.
runft
if
i
might
--
that
--
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
except
that
the
probable
cause
to
issue
a
warrant
must
exist
if
reasonable
legislative
or
administrative
standards
for
conducting
an
area
inspection
are
satisfied
and
it
is
that
word
reasonable.
in
several
cases
that
has
been
zeroed
in
on
in
this
district
court
cases
and
that
is
to
be
found
in
the
camara
case,
that
particular
reference
there
at
387
u.s.
538,
number
--
section
number
14
in
the
opinion.
and
they
are
saying
that
we
do
need
the
presence
of
an
effective
magistrate
here
to
determine
this
reasonableness
in
these
questions
of
probable
cause.
mr.
john
l.
runft
i
believe
the
answer
to
that
lies,
if
i
may,
in
the
--
in
the
fact
which
has
been
brought
out
in
number
of
opinions
versus
--
the
brennan
versus
gibson
products
opinion.
judge
gee
of
the
fifth
circuit,
pointed
out
that
the
actual
findings
underlying
osha
are
indeed
very
thin,
and
certainly
do
not,
themselves,
constitute
standards
that
its
criterion
sufficient
to
explain
or
to
give
a
guide
as
to
how
to
translate
these
needs
into
inspections
as
to
say
how
you
can
--
you
could
express
this
need
against
the
--
to
inspect
against
the
intrusion
into
privacy
that
might
occur.
now,
there
are
details,
guidelines
as
to
procedure
how
they
identify
themselves,
how
the
inspectors
do
these
things.
but
there
are
very
few
standards
here
as
to
how
these
--
how
the
need
of
a
government
to
inspect
is
to
be
compared
or
translated
into
the
--
into
the
intrusion
that
is
to
occur
or
it's
against
intrusion
that
is
to
occur.
and
i
believe
an
answer
to
your
question
also
should
be
pointed
out
that
this
statute
is
not
or
does
not
constitute
pervasive
regulation
in
the
sense
of
the
jm
leasing
case.
there,
justice
blackmun
pointed
out
that
pervasive
regulation,
i
believe
that's
an
interesting
we
have
to
a
definition
of
pervasive
regulation,
that
pervasive
regulation
meant
a
regulation
where
the
nature
of
the
industry
or
endeavor,
the
organization
of
it,
every
aspect
of
it
is
controlled.
here
in
osha,
osha
is
like
the
irs
situation.
you
have
a
thin
slice
that
runs
through
all
of
industry,
but
it's
not
pervasive.
and
when
you
don't
have
pervasive
regulation
of
course,
according
to
the
colonnade
and
biswell
decisions,
if
it
is
not
truly
pervasive
controlling
every
aspect
of
this
industry,
then
you
don't
have
--
you
don't
fit
into
that
narrow
category,
that
narrow
category
of
cases
where
warrant
should
not
be
required.
mr.
john
l.
runft
i
believe
that
it
would
form
objective
evidence
perhaps
sufficient
to
do
it,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
john
l.
runft
i
would
like
to
answer
the
question
yes
or
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
hesitate
to
do
so
for
this
reason.
there
are
occasions
when
i'm
sure
that
a
national
emphasis
program
type
of
situation
would
be
sufficient
to
stand
as
probable
cause
for
an
inspection
to
say
that,
in
one
particular
industry,
you
have
a
very
high
incident
of
accidents
and
we
therefore
use
that
as
grounds
to
inspect.
but
there
should
be
a
magistrate
present
to
ask
these
questions.
“when
was
the
nep
made?”
you
know,
“when
was
this
study
made?
is
this
industry
that
you
proposed
to
inspect
directly
involved
in
exactly
that
type
of
endeavor?”
a
number
of
questions
like
that.
also,
according
to
shell
cast
case,
i
think
this
is
very
significant,
the
magistrate
could
ask
the
osha
inspector
or
the
secretary
of
labor's
representative,
“did
you
attempt
to
make
any
further
inquiry?
did
you
use
the
osha
forms
102,
103,
and
104
which
are
a
form
of
interrogatory
asking
a
particular
business
about
its
own
particular
situations?”
mr.
john
l.
runft
he
could
have,
your
honor,
but
he
didn't.
i
asked
him
to.
mr.
john
l.
runft
the
question
was
asked
by
me
and
he
said
this
is
a
--
this
is
not
a
matter
of
warrant.
this
is
not
probable
cost
hearing.
he
said
my
position
is
merely
to
ascertain
the
jurisdiction
here
and
to
ascertain
that
we
have
a
proper
application
to
the
statute.
mr.
john
l.
runft
yes.
i
pointed
it
out
very,
very
distinctly.
in
fact,
we
had
quite
a
hearing
later
on
of
whether
i
had
reserved
the
constitutional
issues
so
as
not
to
face
res
judicata
on
my
collateral
cause
of
action
and
we
had
to
make
a
transcript
of
that
and
take
it
up
on
that
issue.
i
would
like
to
point
out
one
other
thing,
if
i
may,
that
i
feel
is
extremely
important
and
perhaps
fundamental
here
in
the
secretary's
position
which
i
believe
is
an
error
throughout
his
brief.
and
that
is
this,
throughout
his
brief,
the
secretary
is
attempting
to
apply
a
balancing
test
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
warrant
will
be
issued.
and
i
believe
justice
white's
opinion
in
camara
made
it
very,
very
plain
that
the
balancing
test
is
not
the
test,
that
is
the
balancing
tests
between
the
interest,
is
not
the
test
that
is
applied
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
warrant
is
granted.
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
warrant
is
granted
is
categorical
definitional
test.
is
this
the
type
of
industry
that
falls
into
that
category?
are
these
the
facts
that
we
exempt
from
a
warrant
requirement?
is
this
the
kind
of
industry
we
exempt?
the
liquor
industry
has
a
long
history
of
regulation,
arms,
again,
some
history
and
a
particular
nature
of
that
industry.
those
have
been
specifically
accepted
from
a
warrant
requirement
by
decision
of
this
court
and
at
the
end
of
the
see
case,
see
versus
the
city
of
seattle.
this
court
made
the
further
observation
that
as
to
those
categorical
exceptions,
the
court
would
take
it
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
but
i
submit
that's
not
the
balancing
test
as
justice
white's
opinion
in
camara
points
out
that
balancing
test
comes
later.
the
balancing
test
between
interests
--
mr.
john
l.
runft
the
opinion
of
the
court.
as
the
opinion
of
the
court
states,
the
balancing
test
comes
later
and
with
regard
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
search.
now,
i'm
not
denying
that
a
--
that
a
warrantless
search
must
also
be
reasonable.
any
search
under
the
constitution
or
the
--
pursuant
in
order
to
comply
with
the
fourth
amendment
must
be
reasonable,
whether
it's
a
search
with
or
without
a
warrant.
but
the
question
of
reasonableness
comes
after
the
determination
of
the
categorical
factual
determination
is
made
whether
or
not
a
warrant
will
be
required.
mr.
john
l.
runft
i
will
stand
corrected.
perhaps
i
should
say
they
are
two
separate
questions
that
one
does
not
involve
the
other.
i
stand
corrected,
your
honor.
i
think
--
i
think
that
is
correct.
but
what
i'm
attempting
to
say
here
is
that
that
throughout
the
government's
brief,
they
use
the
method
of
determining
whether
or
not
a
warrant
should
be
issued
according
to
the
government's
brief
is
based
on
a
balancing
test.
they
want
to
balance
the
need
to
inspect
against
what
they
call
the
magnitude
of
the
privacy
interest.
and
even
that
balancing
test,
i
submit,
is
incorrect
because
the
balancing
test
that
is
done
say
in
the
warrant
in
a
probable
cause
showing
is
between
the
need
of
the
government
to
inspect
and
the
degree
of
the
intrusion
on
the
privacy
interest
not
--
you
don't
consider
the
magnitude
of
the
privacy
interest.
the
magnitude
of
the
privacy
interest
is
always
there.
it's
privacy,
her
privacy
interest,
excuse
me.
the
--
the
magnitude
of
the
intrusion
is
what
is
balanced
with
the
need
of
the
government
to
inspect.
the
last
thing
i
want
to
comment
on
very
briefly
is
the
government's
position
here
with
regard
to
privacy.
once
again,
the
court
is
presented
with
the
government's
position
in
this
case
of
a
limited
type
of
privacy,
a
peripheral
privacy
interest,
the
core
interest
of
this
court
and
the
court's
opinion
in
the
chadwick
case
decided
last
june.
very
specifically
rejected
this
type
of
concept
of
a
privacy
interest
on
the
fourth
amendment.
in
fact,
justice
brennan,
in
his
concurring
opinion,
went
so
far
as
to
--
as
to
make
a
remonstrance
that
the
united
states
would
come
back
to
this
court
with
this
type
of
presentation
of
privacy
interest
under
the
fourth
amendment.
now,
once
again
here,
they're
claiming
that
privacy
interest
under
the
fourth
amendment
are
restricted
to
the
home
and
the
office
and
that's
it.
and
that
mr.
barlow
or
people
like
situated
in
--
in
employment
have
a
diminished
privacy
interest
and
the
--
that
their
privacy
interest
isn't
as
strong
as
elsewhere.
and
of
course,
similarly
and
very
definitely
rejected
that
in
the
chadwick
case
decided
last
january.
thank
you.
mr.
john
l.
runft
we
do.
we
do
ask
the
court
to
affirm
the
decision
below.
the
reason
is
that
the
argument
in
that
which
is
the
last
section
of
our
brief
deals
with
the
fact
that
it
is
very
clear
from
the
legislative
history
that
it
was
the
expressed
intent
of
congress
that
the
search
is
conducted
pursuant
to
this
legislation
be
warrantless
searches.
it
is
very
definitely
laid
out.
secondly,
the
minority
--
the
minority
report
by
representative
shirley
specifically
warned
of
the
constitutional
infirmities
involved
in
this
legislation
and
specifically,
pointed
out
the
camara
and
see
cases
and
one
could
say
congress
thereby
was
on
--
was
unnoticed.
secondly,
an
answer
to
that,
the
act
itself
simply
does
not
provide
sufficient
standards
by
which
one
can
--
can
derive
criteria
by
which
to
make
these
inspections.
mr.
john
l.
runft
not
from
the
stand
point
of
standards,
justice
marshall.
procedure,
yes;
standards
no.
thank
you.
mr.
john
l.
runft
thank
you.
