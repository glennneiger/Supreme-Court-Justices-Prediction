justice
potter
stewart
well,
it's
both
more
and
less
isn't
it,
general
mccree?
in
other
words,
as
i
understand
it,
all
you
did
was
present
the
district
court
with
this
statute
and
said
over
the
statute,
we're
authorized
and
empower
to
make
a
search.
there
was
no
finding
of
probable
cause
served
by
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
an
order
--
of
an
order.
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
an
order
simply
that
under
the
statute
is
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
on
this
firm.
and
was
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
no,
that's
--
that's
the
issue
really
in
this
case,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
runft,
you
make
the
point
that
to
require
the
government
to
secure
a
warrant
would
be
no
real
burden
on
them.
i
think
you
said
that,
did
you?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
to
the
extent
that
you
are
right
about
that
then
what
shows
content
for
is
no
real
protection
to
you,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
--
in
the
answer
of
the
questions
of
my
brother
white,
i
thought
i
understood
you
to
say
that
all
of
the
government
would
have
to
show
would
be
something
along
the
lines
of
what
was
required
in
camara
and
see
i.e.,
that
this
is
--
this
is
a
statute
duly
enacted
by
congress
and
signed
by
the
president,
it's
a
valid
federal
law
that
authorizes
inspections
of
any
place
of
business
and
he
shows
that.
and
then
he
shows
that
this
industry
has
an
accident
rate
and
every
industry
has
an
accident
rate
would
be
at
whatever
it
might
be,
it
has
one
and
that's
enough.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
no,
what
circumstances?
justice
potter
stewart
this
establishment
or
this
industry?
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
attack
the
basic
constitutionality
of
this
legislation
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
justified
your
position
primarily
because
of
the
existence
of
this
basic
federal
statute,
isn't
it
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
what
if
congress
should
pass
a
housing
safety
and
health
act?
they're
serving
an
accident
rate
in
all
--
in
all
houses
and
people,
furnishes
explode
and
there
are
fires
and
people
tripped
and
fall
in
their
bathtubs
and
so
on.
and
then,
should
say
that
any
federal
inspector
could
enter
any
home
on
request,
the
argument
will
be
the
same,
wouldn't
it,
because
of
this
basic
statute
then
it
--
it
follows
that
it's
reasonable
for
an
inspector
to
enter
a
house
without
a
warrant?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
argument
would
be
the
same,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
the
absence
of
this
general
legislation,
you
wouldn't
claim
for
a
moment
that
a
federal
agent
could
just
enter
anybody's,
any
employer's
premises
upon
request,
would
you?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
this
is
reasonable
because
of
the
legislation?
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
my
hypothetical
case,
it
would
not
be
equally
reasonable
because
of
the
legislation?
