justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
have
another
case
out
in
marsh
because
you
know
marsh
has
been
diluted
recently.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
shopping
center
case,
do
you
remember?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
that
doesn't
affect
your
one
point.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr
runft,
one
is
ex
parte
and
the
other
is
not.
what
you're
asking
for
is
an
ex
parte
here
and
a
full
magistrate.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
could
then
suppress,
move
to
suppress.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don't
open
any
doors,
do
you?
once
you
get
in
the
place?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah.
why
do
you
get
to
search?
eyeball
search.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
more
than
eyeball
search?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
it
was
restricted
in
the
sense
specifically
in
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
let's
not
just
--
to
me,
that's
not
involving
what
i'm
talking
about.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
talking
about
the
right
when
he
went
there
to
go
in
without
going
to
court.
if
you
had
let
him
in,
are
the
regulations
there
that
say,
what
he
can
do
and
what
he
cannot
do?
are
not
those
regulations
quite
specific?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
thurgood
marshall
wouldn't
the
judge
asked
all
of
those
questions
in
this
case
and
insisted
on
answers?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
couldn't
--
and
couldn't
you
had
asked
him
to
ask
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
not
quite,
but
you
didn't
make
an
offer
of
proof?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
don't
think
the
regulations
helped?
