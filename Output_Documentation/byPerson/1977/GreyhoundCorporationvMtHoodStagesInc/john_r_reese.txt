mr.
john
r.
reese
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court.
i
am
john
reese,
counsel
for
the
petitioners,
the
greyhound
corp
and
greyhound
lines,
inc.
this
is
a
private
anti-trust
case
brought
by
the
respondent,
mt.
hood
stages
against
greyhound.
the
issue
as
to
which
the
court
granted
certiorari
is
whether
the
four-year
statute
of
limitations
in
anti-trust
cases
was
tolled
by
an
interstate
commerce
commission
proceeding
brought
by
mt.
hood
in
which
the
government
later
intervened,
with
the
result
the
damage
period
in
this
case
was
multiplied
five-fold
to
20
years
instead
of
the
normal
four
years.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
statute
was
tolled,
upheld
the
$13
million-treble
damage
judgment
against
greyhound.
without
tolling,
the
judgment
would
still
be
approximately
$8
million.
mr.
john
r.
reese
approximately
$8
million.
the
jury
found
that
mt.
hood
knew
or
should
have
known
of
its
claims
in
this
case
on
a
specific
date
in
december
14,
1960.
therefore,
in
order
to
recover
damages
for
any
period
prior
to
that
date,
mt.
hood
was
required
to
file
its
complaint
within
four
years
by
december
14,
1964.
mt.
hood
did
not
file
its
complaint
within
that
four-year
period.
instead,
it
waited
an
additional
3.5
years.
the
complaint
in
this
case
was
not
filed
until
july
5,
1968.
on
the
face
of
it
then,
the
statute
of
limitations
barred
recovery
for
all
damages
prior
to
july
5,
1964.
the
court
of
appeals,
however,
allowed
recovery
all
the
way
back
to
1953.
it
did
that
on
the
theory
that
the
statute
was
tolled
by
two
different
methods
which
can
then
be
added
together.
first,
it
sustained
the
jury's
finding
that
there
was
fraudulent
concealment
until
december
14,
1960.
then,
it
held
that
the
claims
were
saved
from
being
barred
on
december
14,
1964
because,
on
that
very
day,
the
government
filed
a
petition
asking
leave
to
intervene
in
an
interstate
commerce
commission
proceeding
that
mt.
hood
had
brought.
the
court
held
that
the
filing
of
that
petition
on
that
very
last
day
before
the
claims
were
barred
satisfied
the
requirements
for
tolling
under
section
16(i)
of
the
clayton
act.
section
16(i)
is
obviously
at
the
heart
of
the
issue
before
the
court.
it
is
a
carefully
drawn
statute
and
it
provides
that
whenever
the
united
states
institutes
a
proceeding
to
prevent,
restrain,
or
punish
violations
of
the
anti-trust
laws
then
the
statute
of
limitations
is
tolled
as
to
any
matter
complained
of
in
a
prior
government
proceeding.
now,
it
is
important
to
remember
that
while
section
16(i)
is
a
tolling
provision,
it
is
and
is
part
of
a
statute
of
repose
that
is
designed
to
cut
off
stale
claims.
the
panel
of
the
ninth
circuit
that
decided
this
case
failed
to
recognize
that
purpose.
as
a
result,
its
application
of
the
statute
does
violence
to
the
language
and
frustrates
its
purpose
as
a
statute
of
repose.
mr.
john
r.
reese
the
purpose
of
the
government's
intervention
in
this
case,
mr.
chief
justice,
was
to
assure
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
took
into
account
competitive
policies
as
it
is
required
to
do
under
section
5
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
mr.
john
r.
reese
no,
your
honor,
there
would
not
be
and
as
we
understand
the
law,
as
announced
by
this
court
in
mclean
trucking
minneapolis
and
st.
louis
railway,
that
could
not
follow.
mr.
john
r.
reese
well,
that
is
pretty
accurate,
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice.
one
of
the
duties
of
the
anti-trust
division
of
the
justice
department
is
to
participate
before
administrative
agencies
that
are
required
to
take
into
consideration
competitive
policies
in
their
regulatory
decision
making.
mr.
john
r.
reese
mr.
chief
justice,
we
do
not
want
to
take
such
an
extreme
position
as
to
say
it
could
never
toll
the
statute.
we
do
maintain
that
it
could
never
toll
the
statute
in
a
section
5
proceeding
under
the
interstate
commerce
act.
that
is
a
section
under
which
the
icc
not
only
does
not
enforce
the
anti-trust
laws,
but
indeed,
it
authorizes
and
immunizes
conduct
that
would
otherwise
violate
the
anti-trust
laws.
i
cannot
see
how
a
proceeding
under
that
section
can
fairly
be
read
to
be
one
to
prevent,
restrain,
or
punish
violations
of
the
anti-trust
laws
within
the
meaning
of
section
16(i).
mr.
john
r.
reese
that
is
absolutely
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
it
cannot
even
persuade
the
icc
to
do
so
under
section
5
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
because
that
is
not
the
function
of
the
icc
under
that
section.
indeed,
as
i
understand
mclean
trucking,
the
icc
is
without
power
to
do
that
under
section
5
and
it
certainly
is
not
the
purpose
of
section
5
to
prevent,
restrain,
or
punish
violations
of
the
anti-trust
laws.
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
finding
that
the
statute
was
tolled
by
reason
of
section
16(i)
is
both
bad
statutory
interpretation
and
bad
policy.
it
is
bad
statutory
interpretation
because
the
terms
and
requirements
of
section
16(i)
are
clear.
the
government's
petition
for
leave
to
intervene
does
not
satisfy
those
terms
and
requirements.
that
petition
is
simply
not
an
anti-trust
complaint.
it
is
not
the
kind
of
document
that
should
be
required
to
bring
section
16(i)
to
play.
the
government's
petition
actually
goes
out
of
its
way
to
remain
neutral
and
non-committal
and
to
avoid
making
any
charges.
in
fact,
that
petition
specifically
denied
knowledge
of
the
facts
and
it
did
not
ask
for
any
relief.
the
petition
said
"we
have
no
way
of
knowing
whether
those
of
mt.
hood's
charges
which
greyhound
denies
are
true
or
false."
in
other
words,
that
petition
could
hardly
have
been
more
innocuous.
it
does
not
begin
to
satisfy
the
language
or
the
purpose
of
section
16(i).
to
put
its
deficiencies
in
terms
of
the
statutory
language,
the
petition
did
not
institute
a
civil
or
criminal
proceeding
as
section
16(i)
requires.
the
court
of
appeals
apparently
admits
that
this
proceeding
was
not
instituted
by
the
government.
mr.
john
r.
reese
no,
it
did
not,
mr.
justice
stewart.
it
petitioned
for
leave
to
intervene
from
the
icc,
under
the
icc's
regulations
and
it
was
granted
the
leave
some
several
months
after
the
petition
was
filed.
mr.
john
r.
reese
the
petition
recited
that
only
the
united
states
was
an
interested
party
in
the
proceeding.
it
declined
to
say
on
whose
side
the
united
states
sought
leave
to
intervene.
mr.
john
r.
reese
none,
mr.
justice
stewart.
a
direct
anti-trust
case
could
have
been
brought.
mr.
john
r.
reese
that
is
correct.
the
second
deficiency
of
the
petition
in
terms
of
the
statutory
language
of
section
16(i)
is
that
the
petition
did
not
complain
of
anything,
as
the
statute
clearly
requires.
the
court
of
appeals
does
not
discuss
this
point.
third,
the
government's
petition
did
not
seek
to
prevent,
restrain,
or
punish
violations
of
any
of
the
anti-trust
laws
as
section
16(i)
requires.
on
this
point,
the
best
the
court
of
appeals
can
say
for
us
is
that
the
petition
showed
that
the
government's
interest
lay
in
the
possibility
of
anti-trust
violations
should
mt.
hood's
allegations
prove
correct,
purely
hypothetical.
it
is
plainly
insufficient
to
satisfy
the
requirements
of
section
16(i).
now,
it
is
important
to
remember
also
what
kind
of
proceeding
it
was,
touched
on
this
and
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question
a
moment
ago,
but
it
was
an
icc
proceeding
brought
by
mt.
hood
under
section
5
to
reopen
some
old
acquisition
cases
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
a
supplemental
order
in
those
cases.
it
was
not
an
anti-trust
proceeding
when
mr.
hood
brought
it.
no
one
has
suggested
that
it
would
have
satisfied
the
requirements
of
section
16(i)
at
that
time.
the
government's
petition
for
leave
to
intervene
only
as
interested
party
without
requesting
relief
and
without
making
any
charges
could
not
have
changed
the
fundamental
regulatory
nature
of
that
proceeding
into
an
anti-trust
case
that
satisfies
the
statute.
indeed,
the
justice
department
itself
specifically
distinguishes
that
kind
of
activity
from
its
normal
anti-trust
enforcement
activity.
i
have
been
focusing
on
the
petition
for
leave
to
intervene.
there
are
three
basic
reasons
for
that.
first,
even
mt.
hood
agrees
that
section
16(i)
applies
only
to
the
extent
that
the
private
case
is
based
upon
a
matter
complained
of
in
the
prior
government
proceeding
and
this
court,
in
leh
against
general
petroleum,
said
that
in
general
what
the
government
complained
of
must
be
determined
from
the
face
of
its
complaint.
here,
although
the
petition
for
leave
to
intervene
did
not
complain
of
anything,
that
is
the
only
document
that
is
even
remotely
analogous
to
a
complaint.
second,
since
that
petition
was
filed
on
the
very
last
day
before
the
statute
ran
on
the
claims,
anything
that
the
government
did
after
that
date
would
be
too
late
to
save
the
claims
anyway.
if
the
test
should
be
to
look
beyond
the
face
of
the
government's
first
pleading,
then
tolling
should
commence
only
when
the
government
first
does
something
that
could
fairly
be
called
a
complaint
that
institutes
a
proceeding.
mr.
john
r.
reese
the
judgment
we
are
currently
attacking
is
not
based
upon
any
matter
complained
of
by
the
government
in
the
icc
proceeding.
mr.
john
r.
reese
the
charges
in
the
interstate
commerce
commission
proceeding
as
to
acts
and
practices
are
very
similar
to
the
charges
of
acts
and
practices,
or
at
least
some
of
them,
in
the
anti-trust
case.
mr.
john
r.
reese
there
are
similar
basis
for
the
charges
in
the
anti-trust
case
and
in
the
icc
proceeding.
the
icc
proceeding,
however,
was
never
one
by
the
united
states
to
prevent,
restrain,
or
punish
violations
of
the
anti-trust
laws.
without
that
predicate,
based
upon
language
that
the
chief
justice
had
just
read,
it
seems
to
us
to
be
inapplicable.
mr.
john
r.
reese
yes,
it
is.
mr.
john
r.
reese
i
think,
certainly,
the
statute
contemplates
that
the
action
upon
which
the
private
plaintiff
awaits
to
take
advantage
of
is
a
government
action
in
which
the
government
makes
a
complaint
against
an
alleged
anti-trust
violator.
you
are
absolutely
right,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
john
r.
reese
that
is
the
way
we
understand
the
purpose
to
have
been
conceived
by
congress
in
1914.
mr.
john
r.
reese
it
seems
to
me,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
that
is
what
the
statute
says
and
that
is
what
the
statute
was
designed
to
accomplish.
mr.
john
r.
reese
that
is
right,
mr.
justice
white.
its
petition
specifically
denied
knowledge
of
the
charges
that
mt.
hood
itself
had
made.
mr.
john
r.
reese
that
is
right.
mr.
john
r.
reese
i
believe,
in
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question
earlier,
i
indicated
that
it
does
have
a
duty
under
its
mission
to
participate
before
administrative
agencies,
which
agencies
are
required
by
law
to
take
into
account
policies
of
competition.
i
believe
that
is
why
it
intervened.
mr.
john
r.
reese
your
honor,
the
record
really
does
not
show
much
about
what
the
government
did.
the
only
indications
that
we
have
that
i
can
find
are
that
the
government
sat
there
during
the
proceeding,
cross-examined
some
witnesses,
but
did
not
put
on
any
evidence
of
its
own
during
that
proceeding.
mr.
john
r.
reese
that
may
be.
we
just
do
not
know.
we
do
know
that
when
it
filed
its
petition,
it
refused
or
at
least
declined
to
endorse
the
charges
that
the
private
party
had
made.
mr.
john
r.
reese
that
is
right.
mr.
john
r.
reese
the
minnesota
mining
case,
i
believe,
is
related
to
a
point
that
is
almost
not
involved
in
this
case.
i
understood
the
issue
there
was
principally
whether
a
federal
trade
commission
proceeding
could
satisfy
the
terms
of
section
16(i).
it
was,
however,
a
proceeding
brought
by
the
ftc
to
prevent,
restrain,
or
punish
violations
of
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
that
requirement,
therefore,
clearly
satisfied
the
minnesota
mining
case
as
it
is
not
in
this
one.
mr.
john
r.
reese
i
was
a
little
slow
on
the
uptake
there,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
now,
i
have
been
focusing
on
the
government's
petition
as
i
said
and
there
is
another
reason
still.
the
only
alternative
to
that
is
to
review
the
entire
administrative
proceeding
to
try
to
determine
whether
the
government
eventually
did
complain
of
anything.
we
submit
that
that
imposes
a
heavy
burden
on
the
parties
and
the
courts.
it
is
an
inherently
uncertain
process.
if
the
government's
position
is
not
clear
enough
at
the
outset
of
the
proceeding
to
enable
it
to
state
it
in
a
proper
complaint,
parties
will
have
no
notice
that
their
conduct
is
being
complained
of.
if
the
government
is
unable
to
state
a
complaint
at
the
outset,
how
is
a
party
to
know
from
the
way
it
conducts
itself
later
during
the
course
of
the
proceeding,
whether
it
is
complaining
of
something?
indeed,
if
the
government
is
that
uncertain
at
the
outset,
it
is
likely
to
change
its
position
during
the
course
of
the
proceeding.
what
would
one
do
in
that
case?
does
tolling
depend
on
the
position
the
government
ends
up
taking
or
does
the
statute
start
and
stop
with
each
change
in
the
government's
views?
the
result
of
that
approach
in
general
would
be
that
the
parties
would
not
know
where
they
stood
on
the
anti-trust
statute
of
limitations.
but,
in
any
event,
the
result
of
that
approach
in
this
case
is
that
mt.
hood's
claims
would
still
be
barred.
now,
the
decision
below
is
bad
policy
for
another
reason
as
well.
it
would
take
a
very
specific
and
limited
tolling
provision,
an
exception
to
the
statute
of
limitations
and
broaden
it
to
the
point
where
there
would
be
practically
no
statute
of
limitations
in
regulated
industries.
one
can
hardly
pick
up
a
trade
valuation
report
without
reading
of
some
justice
department
intervention
or
participation
before
one
or
another
of
the
administrative
agencies
and
that
participation
cannot
fairly
be
distinguished
from
the
government's
neutral
petition
to
intervene
in
this
case.
in
other
words,
if
the
decision
below
is
upheld,
the
anti-trust
statute
of
limitations
may
well
be
found
tolled
by
literally
countless
administrative
proceedings
that
no
one
ever
intended
to
prevent,
restrain,
or
punish
violations
of
the
anti-trust
laws.
i
would
say
a
word
about
mt.
hood's
alternative
theory.
mt.
hood
argues
in
the
alternative
that
the
statute
should
be
tolled
to
prevent
injustice
because
it,
itself
brought
the
icc
proceeding.
we
submit
that
that
makes
even
less
sense
than
the
16(i)
tolling
theory.
in
all
of
the
good
reasons
for
not
suspending
the
statute
under
section
16(i)
are
even
better
reasons
for
not
suspending
it
by
a
theory
of
equitable
tolling,
first,
it
would
be
contrary
to
the
policy
of
repose
that
congress
has
sought
to
effect.
second,
it
would
create
even
greater
uncertainty
and
unpredictability
as
to
the
circumstances
and
the
period
of
tolling,
but
more
fundamentally,
equitable
tolling
simply
does
not
fit
the
facts
of
this
case.
in
the
first
place,
equitable
tolling
ought
to
depend
on
the
plaintiffs
having
been
diligent,
but
mt.
hood
was
not
diligent
in
this
case.
it
knew
of
its
claims
in
1960.
it
did
nothing
at
all
about
them
until
1964
when
it
brought
its
icc
proceeding
and
it
waited
almost
eight
years
before
it
finally
filed
the
complaint
in
this
case.
we
submit
that
that
is
not
diligence.
mt.
hood's
equitable
tolling
theory
should
fail
for
want
of
equity
alone.
contrary
to
the
impression
that
mt.
hood's
brief
seeks
to
leave,
there
is
no
forfeiture
or
threat
of
forfeiture
in
this
case.
even
if
mt.
hood
looses
on
the
issues
before
the
court,
the
judgment
that
would
be
remaining
in
its
favor
would
be
nearly
double
the
total
amount
of
its
actual
loss,
as
determined
by
the
jury,
for
the
entire
period
from
1953
to
1973.
to
recover
double
damages
is
not
to
suffer
a
forfeiture.
mt.
hood
is
not
at
all
like
the
plaintiff
on
the
burnet
case,
on
which
it
relies,
who
stood
to
lose
all
remedy
whatever
for
his
injury
of
the
statute
had
not
been
tolled.
we
find
no
excuse
for
mt.
hood's
failure
to
wait
eight
years
to
file
this
case.
the
court's
decision
in
johnson
against
the
railway
express
agency
ought
to
be
dispositive
on
this
point.
in
any
event,
none
of
the
excuses
that
mt.
hood
has
offered
has
any
merit.
it
says
that
it
delayed
filing
this
case
because
it
wanted
to
get
an
injunction,
but
it
is
hard
to
see
how
that
could
excuse
the
delay
if
mt.
hood
had
really
believed
that
it
could
not
file
this
case
sooner
because
it
could
not
ask
the
federal
court
for
injunctive
relief,
and
it
is
even
harder
to
understand
why
it
asked
the
federal
court
for
injunctive
relief
when
it
finally
did
file
this
complaint.
now,
the
doctrine
of
primary
jurisdiction
is
no
excuse
either.
although
mt.
hood
would
have
us
believe
that
its
failure
to
act
was
in
reliance
or
rather
respect
for
that
doctrine,
the
theory
is
plainly
an
afterthought,
was
not
even
raised
in
this
case
until
after
the
trial
when
the
case
had
been
pending
for
more
than
five
years.
i
think
the
court's
decision
in
the
johnson
case
makes
it
clear
that
mt.
hood's
resort
to
an
administrative
agency
cannot
excuse
its
failure
to
take
the
minimal
steps
necessary
to
preserve
each
claim
independently.
in
conclusion,
mt.
hood
delayed
filing
the
case
for
nearly
twice
as
long
as
the
statute
of
limitation
permits.
it
still
stands
to
recover
far
more
than
it
lost
even
if
it
cannot
persuade
this
court
to
extend
the
statute
of
limitations.
there
is
no
reason
why
mt.
hood
should
not
be
held
to
the
statutory
period
that
congress
has
prescribed
for
anti-trust
plaintiffs.
petitioner
submits
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
mr.
john
r.
reese
i
only
wanted
to
take
up
about
two
points.
there
was
some
talk
here
during
counsel's
presentation
about
the
united
states
being
aligned
with
mt.
hood
in
the
icc
proceeding.
counsel
made
the
statement
that
the
united
states
was
driven
to
the
icc.
there
is
a
bit
of
evidence
that
has
not
appeared
in
the
briefs
and
i
would
like
to
call
it
to
the
court's
attention
at
this
time.
in
1964
prior
to
the
time
that
it
filed
its
icc
proceeding,
mt.
hood's
president,
mr.
kennan,
went
to
the
department
of
justice
and
asked
them
to
take
anti-trust
enforcement
action
against
greyhound.
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
the
department
of
justice
determined
not
to
do
that.
mr.
john
r.
reese
that
is
in
the
record
at
transcript
3772-3774.
there
is
another
bit
of
evidence
in
the
record.
this
is
at
clerk's
transcript
record
1006.
that
is
the
reply
that
greyhound
filed
to
mt.
hood's
petition
in
the
icc
and
that
notes
that
mt.
hood
had
gone
to
the
government,
made
some
of
its
charges
that
the
government
had
informed
greyhound
that
it
found
at
least
some
of
those
charges
to
be
without
substantiation.
in
other
words,
even
prior
to
the
time
that
mt.
hood
filed
its
icc
proceeding,
it
appeared
that
it
had
sought
anti-trust
enforcement
relief
from
the
government
and
that
was
not
forthcoming.
the
government
certainly
did
subsequently
intervene,
but
it
is
not
at
all
clear
that
it
was
aligned
with
mt.
hood
and
certainly
not
at
the
outset.
mr.
john
r.
reese
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
cannot
make
that
claim.
mr.
john
r.
reese
i
would
like
to
say
two
things
to
that.
mr.
john
r.
reese
i
understood
him
to
say
that.
the
point
i
am
making
now
is
the
government
was
asked
prior
to
the
time
there
was
any
icc
proceeding
to
bring
an
anti-trust
case,
and
it
did
not
do
it
and
that
is
3772-3774
of
the
transcript.
mr.
john
r.
reese
yes,
and
i
think
it
also
highlights
the
distinction
between
a
normal
anti-trust
enforcement
case
and
this
neutral
petition
for
leave
to
intervene
before
the
icc.
mr.
john
r.
reese
they
could
have
filed
a
civil
action
for
injunctive
relief.
mr.
john
r.
reese
i
am
not
in
position
to
say,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
reese
your
honor,
i
find
the
decision
is
on
primary
jurisdiction
to
be
less
than
clear.
for
example,
one
would
have
thought
that
in
the
otter
tail
cases,
mr.
chief
justice,
a
reference
to
the
agency
might
have
occurred.
i
do
not
think
the
answer
can
be
predicted
with
any
clarity.
i
think
that
the
position
of
relying
upon
primary
jurisdiction
from
the
position
of
hindsight
in
order
to
determine
whether
tolling
has
occurred
is
a
very
hazardous
process.
mr.
john
r.
reese
yes.
mr.
john
r.
reese
before
they
were
over,
the
united
states
took
a
position.
mr.
john
r.
reese
it
would
still
be
an
action
to
enforce
not
the
anti-trust
laws,
but
rather
section
5
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
mr.
john
r.
reese
no.
i
think
i
have
had
my
say
and
i
thank
the
court
for
its
attention.
