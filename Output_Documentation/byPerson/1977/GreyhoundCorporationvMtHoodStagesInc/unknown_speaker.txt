unknown
speaker
or
should
i
say
what
if
any?
unknown
speaker
that
is
in
the
record,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
your
colleague,
of
course,
makes
the
point
that
there
would
have
been
little
or
no
point
for
the
government
to
file
an
anti-trust
action
in
a
federal
district
court
during
the
pendency
of
this
icc
proceeding
because
that
action
would
simply
have
been
delayed
and
the
court
would
have
deferred
to
the
administrative
agency
until
the
completion
of
those
administrative
proceedings.
unknown
speaker
perhaps
i
misunderstood
your
colleague,
but
did
you
understand
him
to
say
that?
unknown
speaker
but
at
least,
in
any
event,
if
the
government
had
filed
a
suit
at
least
it
would
have
then
been
taking
a
position
in
making
a
claim.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
you
do
not
say
that
the
united
states
did
not
take
a
position
before
the
icc
proceedings
were
over?
unknown
speaker
if
they
had
done,
at
the
time
of
their
intervention,
a
complaint
what
they
later
did
a
proceeding,
what
would
you
have
said
then?
unknown
speaker
it
would
not
be
a
civil
action
to
enforce
the
anti-trust
law?
