what
relief
did
they
ask
for?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
relief?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
what
relief
were
they
seeking?
we
are
talking
about
a
document
now.
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
you
get
to
the
point
in
wherefore
or
something.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
know
what
i
am
talking
about?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
was
not
in
this.
it
was
not
even
in
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
relief
they
were
seeking
was
the
tolling
of
the
statutes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
toll
the
statutes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
the
relief
they
were
asking.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
crew,
do
you
know
of
any
case
where
somebody
came
in
and
said
"i
want
to
be
a
party
and
the
reason
i
want
to
be
a
party
is
i
agree
with
the
other
party."
that
is
all.
do
you
not
have
to
show
an
independent
basis
to
be
a
party?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
not
have
to
ask
for
something
and
allege
something?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
it
not
this
amicus
brief
"that
is
all"?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
it
says
is,
"i
agree
with
what
mt.
hood
might
be
able
to
prove."
they
do
not
say
"i
agree
with
what
they
can
do."
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
do
not
say
it
makes
them
believe
in
any
place
in
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
are
not
magic
words,
they
are
necessary
words.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
i
think
that
they
want
to
intervene
as
a
party.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
order
to
intervene
as
a
party,
i
understood
the
general
rule
was
you
have
to
allege
enough
on
your
own
to
be
a
party
and
not
to
ride
on
somebody
else's
tales.
justice
thurgood
marshall
after
he
says
which
side
he
is
on.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
they
did
not
say
it
here.
they
do
not
know
what
side
they
are
on
yet.
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
i
am
getting
to
it,
they
were
against
greyhound.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
are
not
necessarily
with
mt.
hood.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
more
free
to
read
the
record
and
find
out
for
myself?
justice

for
myself?
justice

news
for
you.
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
you
talk
about
expeditious,
one
day
late
and
they
would
not
have
had
any
problem,
would
they
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
crew.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
did
the
government
get
out
of
the
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
cannot
find
it.
i
could
not
even
find
the
in
court
of
appeals
heading.
justice

the
court
of
appeals,
the
caption.
