chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
greyhound
corp.
against
mt.
hood
stages
mr.
reese,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
give
me
that
last
figure
again.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
say
was
the
purpose
of
the
government's
intervention
in
this
case,
mr.
reese?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
to
pursue
that,
what
would
be
the
consequences
of
its
participation?
would
there
be
any
consequences
that
would
either
punish
violations
or
restrain
violations
or
prevent
violations?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
what
was
the
real
impact
of
their
being
there?
is
it
to
help
the
commission
understand
the
case
a
little
better?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
say
an
intervention
by
the
united
states
could
never
toll
the
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
course,
the
department
of
justice
anti-trust
division
itself
does
not
punish
or
restrain,
does
it?
it
can
only
persuade
a
court
to
do
so
is
it
not
the
essence
of
it
or
other
tribunal?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
judgment
which
you
are
challenging
now
depend
in
any
parts,
in
whole
or
in
part,
using
the
language
of
the
statute
now
on
any
matter
complained
of
in
the
said
proceeding,
that
is,
in
the
icc
proceeding
in
which
the
government
intervened?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
complained
of
by
the
government,
complained
of
by
mt.
hood,
that
is
my
question.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
why
does
this
case
not
within
that
language
which
i
believe
is
your
brief?
it
is
at
top
page
7
and
italicized
in
section
16(i),
on
top
of
page
7
reading,
"the
running
of
the
statute
of
limitations
in
respect
of
every
private
or
state
right
arising
under
said
laws
and
based
in
whole
or
in
part
on
any
matter
complained
of
in
the
said
proceeding."
now,
if
you
say
that
the
anti-trust
judgment
ultimately
depends
and
rests
in
part
on
what
mt.
hood
was
complaining
of,
then
why
does
the
statute
not
apply?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
it
must
be
the
united
states
that
is
making
the
anti-trust
complaint
in
your
view?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
the
injured
party.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
do
you
think
it
makes
any
difference
whether
the
private
litigant
rides
on
the
government
or
whether
the
government
rides
on
the
private
litigant's
proceeding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
it
just
an
interested
spectator
and
if
so,
could
not
the
government
do
this
from
the
bleachers
without
joining
in
the
action?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that
could
be
because
they
thought
that
the
private
party
was
doing
well
enough
without
them.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
your
focus,
i
take
it,
is
that
the
government
as
such
did
not
institute
any
proceeding
either
to
prevent,
to
restrain,
or
to
punish.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
reese.
mr.
crew?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
do
you
say
that
the
intervention
of
the
united
states
fits
into
the
language
of
the
statute
as
a
proceeding
instituted
by
the
united
states
to
prevent,
restrain,
or
punish?
what
did
the
united
states
do
in
that
proceeding?
what
did
it
assert
in
its
intervention
or
what
did
it
do
after
the
intervention
to
prevent,
restrain,
or
punish?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
mean
they
would
refuse
to
approve
the
acquisition?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
would
fall
under
the
language
of
the
statute
that
prevents.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
not
correct
that
sometimes
the
anti-trust
division
simply
sits
back
and
waits
for
the
facts
to
develop
and
then
make
some
decision
whether
they
will
commence
proceedings
independently?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
you
do
not
agree
with
the
implication
of
my
question
that
the
government
was
free
at
any
time
despite
the
pendency
of
these
icc
proceedings
to
file
an
anti-trust
action
or
in
the
event,
if
it
filed
one,
you
say
it
would
have
been
deferred
and
delayed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
this
was
the
government's
only
alternative?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired,
but
we
will
extend
it
two
minutes
and
we
will
give
your
colleague
the
same.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired
now,
mr.
crew.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
suggest
this
was
greyhound?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that
undermines
the
possibility
of
their
intervention
being
construed
as
the
institution
of
a
proceeding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
could
have
done
at
that
time.
what
would
you
say
the
government
could
have
done
at
that
time
to
prevent
or
restrain
an
anti-trust
violation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
would
the
court
have
done
with
that
while
the
icc
procedure
was
pending?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
the
fact
of
the
matter
you
know
they
would
not
have
proceeded,
do
you
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
two
opinions
and
judgments
of
the
court
to
announce,
united
states
against
lasalle
national
bank
and
greyhound
corporation
against
mt.
hood
stage.
