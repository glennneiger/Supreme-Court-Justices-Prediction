mr.
eugene
c.
crew
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court.
greyhound
claims
that
the
question
before
this
court
is
whether
mt.
hood
should
be
allowed
to
expand
the
statutory
period
five-fold
from
4-20
years.
i
submit
that
is
not
the
question.
the
question
is
whether
the
statute
should
be
tolled
for
the
brief
3.5-year
period,
december
1960
to
july
1964,
by
reason
of
the
icc
proceedings
so
as
to
allow
mt.
hood
to
recover
damages
proven
for
those
years
that
greyhound
was
found
to
have
violated
the
anti-trust
laws
and
to
have
fraudulently
concealed
those
violations
from
mt.
hood.
the
lower
courts
held
the
statute
was
tolled
under
section
16(i)
and
we
ask
this
court
to
affirm
on
that
ground
and
on
the
additional
ground
that
this
court's
equitable
doctrine
of
tolling
applies.
both
statutory
and
equitable
tolling
on
the
facts
presented
here
will
promote
various
important
federal
policies
which
may
be
collectively
described
as
the
orderly
procedure
developed
by
congress
and
this
court
for
the
private
enforcement
of
the
anti-trust
laws
against
defendants
regulated
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
mr.
chief
justice,
the
government
and
i
would
point
out
that
it
was
the
anti-trust
division
of
the
justice
department,
not
another
division
such
as
the
tax
division
or
the
civil
rights
division,
but
it
was
the
anti-trust
division
of
the
justice
department
that
petitioned
for
leave
to
intervene
in
december
1964.
i
submit
that
it
is
the
intervention
of
the
government
at
that
time
which
constitutes
the
institution
of
a
civil
action
within
the
preview
of
16(i).
i
would
point
out,
we
must
begin
with
a
language
of
the
statute
and
that
is
true,
but
i
submit
that
when
they
did
intervene
on
that
day,
the
justice
department
instituted
a
civil
action
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
as
only
the
justice
department
could
do.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
thank
you.
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
relief
sought
by
the
justice
department,
and
i
believe
this
is
a
fair
reading
of
the
petition
on
its
face
alone
and
i
submit
that
they
referred
expressly
and
i
will
not
take
up
the
court's
time
by
reading
the
petition
to
the
court,
but
i
think
a
fair
reading
of
that
petition
demonstrates
that
it
was
relying
upon
not
only
the
sworn
allegations
of
mt.
hood
on
its
verified
petition,
but
also
other
evidence
and
on
the
basis
of
that,
was
telling
the
interstate
commerce
commission
that
it
had
cause
to
suspect
that
an
anti-trust
violation
might
have
occurred
and
if
the
facts
prove
so
at
a
hearing,
that
relief
should
be
granted
to
prevent
further
violations.
it
is
a
fair
reading,
i
submit,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
the
relief
that
i
believe
they
were
seeking?
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
yes,
sir.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
right.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
mr.
justice,
it
is
true
that
the
word
'relief'
probably
does
not
appear
in
the
petition,
but
what
i
think
is
clear
from
a
fair
reading
of
the
document
is
that
they
were
seeking
relief.
i
would
point
out
--
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
your
honor,
they
did
toll.
we
do
submit
that
it
did.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
no,
not
the
justice
department,
your
honor,
but
that
is
the
relief
we
do
seek
here.
i
am
sorry,
mr.
justice.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
cannot
say
that.
i
believe
that
it
does
seek
relief
and
i
would
point
out
to
your
honor
that,
for
example
and
this
would
be
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
39,
the
government
stated
"if
anything,
the
need
for
sharp
surveillance
of
any
abuse
of
the
power
of
these
acquisitions
have
given
greyhound
and
for
a
prompt
action
to
correct
any
such
abuse
has
become
more
important
as
greyhound's
(inaudible)
mt.
hood
has
become
more
complete
with
each
successive
acquisition.
on
the
last
page
of
the
petition,
at
page
41
of
the
appendix,
again,
the
justice
department
points
out
that
the
anti-trust
laws
are
very
much
involved
and
that
while
the
approvals
might
be
except,
predatory
conduct
made
possible
by
those
acquisitions
would
not
be,
as
they
state
in
the
last
paragraph,
"for
if
it
then
appears
that
the
commission
lacks
jurisdiction
to
dispose
of
mt.
hood's
compliant
in
whole
or
in
part,
mt.
hood
remitted
to
another
forum
may
find
relief
elsewhere
loosely
if
it
comes
too
late
to
be
effective."
now,
it
may
not
be
the
orthodox
prayer
that
we
see
in
the
typical
complaint
where
it
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
but
i
submit
that
these
document,
within
the
four
corners,
prays
for
relief.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
the
anti-trust
relief,
mr.
stewart,
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
could
give
was
the
relief
it
gave
and
that
was
to
enter
a
seize-and-decease
order
which
attempted
to
prevent
greyhound
from
continuing
its
predatory
behavior
to
destroy
mt.
hood's
business
and
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
that
is
exactly
the
relief
that
was
given
and
it
was
the
relief
that
was
sought
and
it
was
granted
in
substantial
part
because
the
justice
department
intervened
and
sought
it
on
behalf
of
mt.
hood.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
believe
that
it
has
the
power
and
the
duty
to
enforce
the
anti-trust
laws
and
to
prevent
the
--
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
no,
of
course,
it
cannot,
mr.
stewart,
but
it
certainly
can
do
everything
else.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
without
reference
to
the
interstate
commerce
act?
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
that
is
right,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart
and
i
would
say
that
the
authority
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
enforce
the
anti-trust
laws
is
statutory
and
i
would
refer
primarily
to
section
5
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
to
section
15
usc
21
of
the
us
code,
and
i
would
refer
to
the
national
transportation
policy
which
prohibits
--
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
i
believe
so.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
that
is
true,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
believe
that
this
was
a
section
5
proceeding.
now,
if
the
justice
department
had
intervened
at
that
time
and
asked
that
the
acquisitions
be
disapproved
because
they
violated
anti-trust
concepts
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission
disapproved
the
acquisitions,
then
i
would
submit
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
was
enforcing
the
anti-trust
laws
by
preventing
a
violation
at
that
time.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
in
terms
of
the
conduct
that
the
justice
department
wanted
to
prevent,
they
were
co-extensive.
in
terms
of
the
legal
standards
to
be
applied,
i
believe
that
the
justice
department's
intervention
brought
the
anti-trust
laws
to
bear,
but
i
would
have
to
say
that
they
are
co-extensive
there
too,
because
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
a
duty
to
enforce
the
anti-trust
laws
whether
the
justice
department
intervened
or
not.
so
i
submit
that
although
mt.
hood's
petition
did
not
expressly
refer
to
the
anti-trust
laws,
that
the
relief
that
mt.
hood
was
seeking
was
a
prevention
of
destructive
competition
in
violation
of
those
laws.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
i
believe
i
would
say
that
is
correct,
that
they
both
sought
the
prevention
of
predatory
conduct
and
violation
of
the
anti-trust
laws
and
the
interstate
commerce
act,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
mr.
justice
white,
i
believe
that
the
statute
requires
reasonable
notice
to
the
party
against
the
statute.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
mr.
justice
white,
firstly,
i
believe
that
a
position
does
have
to
be
taken,
but
i
would
add,
if
you
will
permit,
by
stating
that
the
justice
department
clearly
did
take
a
position
and
its
position
was
to
align
with
mt.
hood
and
against
greyhound
from
the
very
outset.
i
believe
that
it
was
stating
that
--
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
mr.
justice
white,
i
would
start
with
the
petition
itself.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
mr.
justice
white,
it
is
correct
that
the
justice
department
stated
that,
but
i
do
not
see
really
any
difference
between
that
and
any
complaint
that
is
filed
in
a
federal
court.
the
government
was
referring
to
the
sworn
allegations
of
mt.
hood
and
stated
"while
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
the
facts,
we
have
cause
to
suspect."
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
not
in
the
same
respect
that
it
may
be
in
a
complaint,
but
i
do
believe
that
it
was.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
yes
it
did,
mr.
justice
white.
it
did
cross-examine
witnesses.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
no,
it
did
not,
but
it
cross-examined
the
witnesses
that
were
the
parties
to
the
case,
that
is,
it
examined
greyhound
witnesses
who
were
already
there
and
crossed-examined
them.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
yes.
mr.
justice
white,
i
believe
that
it
did
and
i
would
refer
--
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
i
believe
that
i
know,
but
i
would
refer
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
decision.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
mr.
justice
white,
we
do
not
have
in
the
record
below
the
briefs
that
were
filed
and
frankly
if
i
had
thought
of
it,
they
would
be
in
the
record
before
this
court
now,
but,
what
is
in
the
record
in
so
far
as
this
court's
judicial
notice
is
concerned
is
the
published
decision
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
104
mcc
449
and
there,
there
are
two
or
three
references
to
relief
sought
by
the
justice
department
and
complaints
made
by
the
justice
department
throughout
these
proceedings,
including
examination
of
witnesses,
the
filing
of
briefs.
greyhound
filed
exceptions
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
order
and
the
justice
department
along
with
mt.
hood
filed
a
reply
to
those
exceptions.
so,
it
was
stating
a
position
to
greyhound
that
at
that
time
and
at
one
point
in
the
--
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
no,
i
think
that
that
point
that
you
had
asked
about
is
the
filing
of
the
petition.
i
believe
that
they
took
a
position
then
and
the
subsequent
events
during
the
proceedings
substantiated
and
corroborated
that
that
was
their
position
from
the
outset.
but
mr.
justice
white
and
your
honors,
i
would
say
that
when
the
justice
department
filed
its
petition
i
believe
it
was
saying
no
more
than
what
any
complaint
in
a
court
action
could
in
good
faith
say
and
that
is,
we
do
not
have
the
facts
yet,
but
we
have
cause
to
suspect
and
we
need
a
hearing
and
if
that
hearing
bears
out
those
facts,
then
we
want
relief.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
mr.
justice
marshall
i
believe
that
--
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
i
think
that
that
is
true,
but
i
think
that
that
is
exactly
what
--
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
i
would
say
not,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
mr.
justice
marshall,
that
is
precisely
what
any
plaintiff
will
say
when
he
files
an
allegation
on
information
or
belief,
is
that
this
is
what
i
believe
i
might
be
able
to
prove.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
they
do
not
use
those
magic
words,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
believe
that
if
it
is
required
that
those
words
be
here
--
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
believe
that
the
law
concerning
intervention
in
our
federal
courts,
for
example,
indicates
that
an
intervener,
once
that
leave
is
granted,
becomes
a
party
no
less
than
a
plaintiff
than
a
defendant.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
that
is
correct.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
your
honor,
i
believe
that
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
justice
department
was
aligned
with
mt.
hood
and
against
greyhound
and
i
would
point
out
the
sole
purpose
for
the
justice
department's
intervention.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
that
is
correct.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
your
honor,
i
would
point
out
first
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
this
decision
stated,
and
this
was
not
mentioned
in
our
brief
so
i
would
like
to
point
it
out
here,
at
page
457
of
the
icc
report,
"the
department
of
justice
urges
that
petitioners,
that
is
mt.
hood,
charges
be
sustained
in
full
and
that
respondent
greyhound
also
be
found
to
be
in
continuing
violation
of
section
216
referring
to
the
interstate
commerce
act."
it
stresses
respondent
greyhound's
arrogant
attitude,
doubts
that
a
one-year
policing
period
is
long
enough
and
suggests
five
years
or
even
indefinite
surveillance.
now,
that
certainly
demonstrates
that
the
justice
department
was
not
a
mere
neutral
petitioner
or
an
amicus.
it
was
coming
in
as
a
party,
an
intervener,
but
a
party,
to
seek
relief
and
it
did
join
sides
with
mt.
hood,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
--
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
pardon,
mr.
justice?
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
i
believe
that
would
be
so.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
i
am
not
submitting
that,
mr.
justice.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
decision
of
the
icc,
together
with
the
petition
of
the
government
indicate,
beyond
per
adventure
that
the
justice
department
intervened
to
prevent
a
violation
of
the
anti-trust
laws
and
was
seeking
relief
to
prevent
a
violation
if
the
evidence
at
the
hearing
demonstrated
the
violation.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
the
part
i
read
does
not
refer
to
the
anti-trust
laws,
but
it
does
state
that
mt.
hood's
charges
should
be
sustained
in
full.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
in
addition,
they
refer
to
216,
but
the
interstate
commerce
commission
also
referred
expressly
to
the
anti-trust
laws,
as
to
the
chicago
federal
court
in
affirming,
and
stated
that
the
icc
was,
in
granting
that
relief,
applying
the
anti-trust
laws
to
greyhound's
conduct.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
you
are
correct
that
it
did
not
allow
any
broadening
of
the
issues,
but
i
think
that
helps
support
the
position
that
the
issues
concerning
anti-trust
laws
were
already
present.
i
believe
that
any
time
an
intervener
intervenes
that
they
usually
intervene
on
the
basis
of
the
issues
drawn
at
that
time
and
i
believe
that
the
anti-trust
issues
were
already
a
part
of
the
proceedings.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
do
not
believe
it
is.
firstly,
when
mt.
hood
filed
its
petition,
i
submit
that
it
was
seeking
to
prevent
a
violation
of
the
anti-trust
laws
because
it
was
being
destroyed
by
predatory
conduct
which
violates
those
laws,
no
other
law
and
the
icc
has
a
duty
to
enforce
those
laws
and
the
justice
department
intervened
to
ensure
that
the
icc
enforces
those
laws.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
are
you
referring
to
the
duty
of
mt.
hood
to
file
an
action?
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
to
file
a
court
action?
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
your
honor,
that
really
does
get
to
the
alternative
ground
for
tolling.
i
believe
that
if
we
are
going
to
refer
to
mt.
hood's
position,
i
would
like
to
address
that
question
which
is
under
equitable
tolling,
if
i
may.
if
i
do
i
would,
in
response
to
your
question
state
that
mt.
hood
should
not
have
filed
a
court
action
at
the
time
that
it
filed
the
interstate
commerce
commission
proceedings
because
to
do
so
would
have
been
a
futile
act
and
an
idle
act,
and
would
be
discouraged
by
the
doctrine
of
primary
jurisdiction.
but
firstly,
mt.
hood,
in
terms
of
injunctive
relief
had
no
forum
to
go
to,
save
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
it
is
the
only
place
it
could
go
and
having
gone
there,
i
would
submit
and
i
would
like
to
address,
that
if
i
may
now
in
the
time
remaining,
under
equitable
tolling.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
pardon,
mr.
justice?
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
yes,
you
are
free
to
seek
damages,
but
under
the
doctrine
of
equitable
tolling
and
the
doctrine
of
primary
jurisdiction,
i
believe
that
mt.
hood
was
effectively
and
legally
precluded
from
prosecuting
an
action
to
recover
damages
until
the
interstate
commerce
commission
had
first
passed
the
--
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
yes.
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
believe
that
it
would
be
even
more
compelling
in
that
case
because
the
interstate
commerce
commission
was
already
considering
prospect
of
relief
with
respect
to
mt.
hood's
petition.
at
that
point
in
time,
had
the
justice
department
filed
a
court
action
for
a
prospect
of
relief
with
respect
to
the
same
conduct,
i
think
that
a
dismissal
would
have
been
inevitable
under
fareast
and
cue
and
art
and
other
cases.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
well,
that
is
the
reverse
of
what
i
think
the
laws
contemplate,
but
they
sometimes
do
and
i
think
that,
in
this
case,
had
mt.
hood
filed
as
it
did,
the
justice
department
had
two
choices,
either
sit
back
and
wait
until
mt.
hood
resolved
the
issue
in
the
agency
or
filed
an
agency
proceeding
or
intervene
in
the
agency
proceeding,
but
among
its
alternatives,
i
submit,
under
the
law
of
this
country,
was
not
to
file
a
court
action
in
the
face
of
the
icc
proceedings
because
i
think
it
would
have
created
a
direct
and
immediate
conflict
between
the
two
forums.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
it
would
have
been
deferred
and
delayed
and
ineffectual
because
of
the
doctrine
of
primary
jurisdiction
that
would
be
invoked
in
that
instance.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
i
believe
that
this
was
the
government's
only
alternative,
namely
to
go
to
the
icc.
i
think
it
was
literally
driven
there
by
the
law.
i
think
that
it
had
to
go
to
the
icc
whether
it
would
be
to
file
a
complaint
and
then
consolidate
it
with
mt.
hood's
complaint
or
to
file
a
petition
to
intervene
and
i
think
what
it
did
was
the
most
expeditious
thing
that
it
could.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
i
think
that
is
correct
and
we
are
saved
by
a
day.
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
marshall,
under
statutory
tolling,
but
i
would
like,
if
i
may,
to
address
equitable
tolling
in
the
time
left.
your
honors,
we
submit
that
without
statutory
tolling
and
without
section
16(i)
this
court
has
declared
that
a
federal
statute
should
be
tolled
if
it
would
promote
important
federal
policies
without
frustrating
the
statute
of
limitations
policy
repose.
we
believe
that
in
light
of
the
tolling
principle
that
is
annunciated
in
the
burnet
case,
in
american
pipe,
and
most
recently
in
the
johnson
case
that
tolling
should
at
least
apply
if
the
following
factors
are
present
and
we
submit
these
factors
were
present
here.
firstly,
that
a
plaintiff's
prior
resort
to
an
agency
having
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
conduct
alleged
and
a
subsequent
anti-trust
complaint
is
necessary
to
the
maintenance
and
prosecution
of
his
anti-trust
claim.
secondly,
that
a
plaintiff
is
required
to
obtain
his
injunctive
remedy.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
mr.
justice
stevens,
the
answer
to
that
question
i
submit
is
the
doctrine
of
primary
jurisdiction
which
is
particularly
applicable
when
an
anti-trust
exemption
is
available
in
this
case
and
i
--
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
mr.
justice
stevens,
that
is
correct,
however,
that
did
not
prevent
greyhound
from
asserting
that
the
anti-trust
exemption
applied
and
they
asserted
that
right
up
to
this
court.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
in
a
technical
sense
that
is
correct,
but
i
submit
that
by
virtue
of
the
law
of
primary
jurisdiction,
that
case
would
have
been
dismissed
in
1964.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
but
mt.
hood
i
submit,
your
honor,
was
legally
powerless
to
file
a
damage
action
in
1964
by
virtue
of
the
doctrine
of
primary
jurisdiction.
it
could
have
filed
for
damages
and
i
submit
that
under
the
law
of
fareast,
cue
and
art,
carnation,
ricky,
and
other
case
of
this
court
that
started
from
the
turn
of
the
century,
that
case
would
have
been
dismissed
or
at
most,
stayed.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
that
is
a
possibility.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
mr.
justice
white,
i
believe
in
answer
to
that
question,
we
would
have
to
assess
what
mt.
hood
did
in
1964.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
mt.
hood
acted
reasonably
at
that
time
and
i
believe
that
it
should
have
done
the
same
thing
today,
but
what
i
am
stressing
here
is
that
in
1964,
the
law
of
this
country
under
primary
jurisdiction
indicated
that
his
case
would
have
been
dismissed,
not
stayed
and
i
would
point
out,
your
honors,
the
carnation
decision
which
was
reversed
by
this
court
in
1966
to
substitute
a
stay
for
dismissal,
but
the
ninth
circuit,
in
1964,
had
stated
that
such
a
case
on
similar
facts
to
this
case
must
be
dismissed
because
the
district
court
lacked
jurisdiction.
so
i
think
that
there
was
enough
law.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
lack
of
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
anti-trust
claim.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
yes,
the
carnation
case
was
a
damage
action.
yes,
your
honor.
but
lack
of
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
anti-trust
claim
until
the
interstate
commerce
commission
had
first
resolved
the
immunity
question
and
had
a
chance
to
pass
upon
the
matter
under
this
salutary
doctrine
of
primary
jurisdiction.
in
addition
to
the
requirement
of
primary
jurisdiction
as
an
element,
i
was
stating
that
the
second
factor
which
was
present
here
too
is
that
the
plaintiff
is
required
to
obtain
its
injunctive
remedy
in
one
forum
and
his
damage
remedy
in
another
forum
and
is
legally
precluded
from
seeking
both
remedies
in
the
same
forum.
now,
that
was
clearly
the
case
here.
thirdly,
and
this
is
one
more
factor
which
should
be
present
and
was
present
here,
that
despite
this
legal
bifurcation
of
remedies
between
two
forums,
the
plaintiff's
claim
is
factually
and
legally
identical
so
as
to
satisfy
the
requirement
of
notice
stated
in
the
johnson
case
and
thereby
avoid
the
evils
against
which
the
statute
of
limitation
is
designed
to
protect.
with
respect
to
that
factor,
i
would
point
out
that
the
claim
here
presented
in
both
the
icc
and
the
court
was
factually
the
same
and
i
submit
that
it
was
legally
the
same,
and
only
the
remedies
were
different
and
that
is
due
to
the
bifurcation
in
the
law
confronting
mt.
hood.
mt.
hood
invoked
the
icc's
jurisdiction
to
apply
the
anti-trust
laws
to
greyhound's
conduct
for
adjunctive
relief
purposes
and
then
before
the
court,
apply
the
anti-trust
laws
for
purposes
of
damages.
your
honors,
the
johnson
decision,
which
i
think
is
an
important
decision,
declared
that
the
statute
of
limitations
may
be
tolled
if
there
is
a
federal
body
of
procedural
law
which
denotes
interdependency
between
two
proceedings
and
a
positive
preference
that
one
be
undertaken
before
the
other.
i
submit
that
federal
policy
is
present
here.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
the
government
is
there
today,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
which,
your
honor?
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
they
are
not
in
this
case,
but
in
the
interstate
commerce
commission
proceedings
the
justice
department
has
never
gotten
out.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
actually,
the
justice
department
did
intervene
in
this
case
at
an
early
stage
of
the
proceedings
for
discovery
purposes
and
conducted
discovery
in
this
case
to
be
used
in
the
contempt
proceedings
that
took
place
in
chicago.
with
respect
to
the
federal
policy
or
federal
body
of
procedural
law
which
the
johnson
case
requires,
i
would
point
out
that
they
are
two.
first,
i
would
like
to
consider
the
federal
policy
expressed
in
15
usc
26,
the
injunction
remedy
under
the
anti-trust
laws.
despite
the
importance
of
this
remedy
and
the
obvious
preference
that
a
plaintiff
tried
to
save
his
business
first
in
mitigation
of
his
damages,
that
remedy
was
not
available
to
mt.
hood
in
the
courts.
when
mt.
hood
was
about
to
go
under
as
a
result
of
greyhound's
conduct
in
1964,
it
went
to
the
only
forum
that
was
available
to
it
to
save
its
business.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
thank
you,
your
honor.
that
was
not
a
preference,
as
mentioned
by
johnson,
but
it
was
a
congressional
mandate.
in
that
respect,
your
honors,
mt.
hood
differed
from
the
plaintiff
in
johnson.
johnson
plaintiff
could
have
gotten
full
relief
from
the
federal
court
if
he
wished,
but
he
exercised
his
valuable
option
not
to
do
so.
mt.
hood
had
no
such
option
here.
the
doctrine
of
primary
jurisdiction
also
is
a
federal
doctrine
which
directed
plaintiff,
mt.
hood,
to
go
to
the
icc
and
it
is
particularly
applicable
here
because
of
anti-trust
exemptions
claim.
your
honors,
i
would
say
this
that
the
doctrine
of
primary
jurisdiction
has
always
been
invoked
by
defendants,
never
by
plaintiffs,
to
protect
defendants
against
premature
lawsuits.
i
believe
that
the
primary
jurisdiction
doctrine
should
now
be
completed
and
that
the
statute
of
limitation
should
be
tolled
for
those
plaintiffs
who
lack
in
accordance
with
it.
judicial
economy
will
be
served
just
as
notions
of
litigative
efficiency
were
served
by
tolling
the
statute
in
american
pipe.
on
the
point
of
equities,
counsel
for
greyhound
stated
that
we
do
not
have
a
shred
of
equity,
that
mt.
hood
was
not
diligent,
and
that
our
damages
should
be
reduced
from
treble
to
double
damages
to
avoid
a
windfall.
first,
congress
said
treble
damages,
it
did
not
say
double
damages.
greyhound
cannot
use
this
as
a
rationalization
to
deny
tolling.
secondly,
greyhound's
claim
regarding
the
equities
requires
that
the
equities
be
balanced
and
compared.
greyhound
was
found
by
the
jury
to
have
fraudulently
concealed
its
conduct
for
11
years,
from
1953
to
1964.
with
respect
to
mt.
hood's
behavior,
greyhound
states,
you
were
not
diligent.
you
should
have
filed
your
action
in
1962
or
1963.
mr.
eugene
c.
crew
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
that
is
a
false
issue
in
that
incidence
because
whether
or
not
they
were
diligent
then
is
irrelevant
to
the
question
of
whether
tolling
occurred
later.
thank
you,
your
honors.
