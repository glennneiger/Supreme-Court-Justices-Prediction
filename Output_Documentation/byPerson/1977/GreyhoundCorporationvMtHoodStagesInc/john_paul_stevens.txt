mr.
crew,
why
is
that
necessary
in
this
case?
why
could
you
not
just
have
filed
a
suit
in
december
without
ever
going
into
the
icc
except
you
wanted
a
different
kind
of
relief
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
anti-trust
exemption
went
to
the
acquisitions
and
your
basis
of
your
recover
of
damages
assumes
that
the
acquisitions
were
immune
from
the
anti-trust
laws,
as
i
understand
it?
