justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
also
say,
i
take
it,
in
your
brief
that
even
if
the
intervention
could
be
thought
of
as
an
instituting
the
case,
the
government
did
not
complain
of
anything
in
that
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
did
not
complain
of
anything
in
that
suit
that
the
petitioner
in
that
suit
may
have
complained
of?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
did
it
intervene?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
not
think
a
kind
of
a
suit
that
the
tolling
provision
is
talking
about
at
least
requires
the
united
states
to
make
some
assertions
as
to
the
fact?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
the
united
states
in
its
petition
said
that
it
had
no
idea
whether
mt.
hood's
allegations
were
true
or
false
and
it
took
no
position
on
whether
they
were
true
or
false?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
did
it
ever
make
itself
take
any
position
with
respect
to
the
facts?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
it
says
"we
had
no
way
of
knowing
whether
those
of
mt.
hood's
allegations,
which
greyhound
denies,
are
true
or
false."
justice
byron
r.
white
the
government
itself
then
was
not
undertaking
to
prove
these
facts.
it
was
not
its
own
lawsuit.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
it
participate
in
hearing
and
call
witnesses?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
did
it
call
its
own?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
it
submit
suggested
findings
to
the
hearing
officer?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
believe
or
do
you
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
they
not
be
in
the
record
filed
here
if
they
did
submit
some
suggestions?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
at
some
point
in
the
proceeding
you
are
saying
that
the
united
states
took
a
solid
position
with
respect
to
the
facts
of
the
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
as
to
what
relief
should
be
granted.
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
their
complaint
intervention
could
be
so
characterized
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
you
cited
in
your
brief
the
cases
you
think
would
require
a
dismissal
rather
than
just
a
stay
and
a
reference.
why
would
the
district
court
not,
if
you
filed
a
suit
for
damages,
simply
say
"under
primary
jurisdiction
you
must
first
go
over
to
the
commission
and
if
you
have
a
favorable
judgment
there,
come
back"?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
then
do
you
tell
us
that
there
would
have
to
be
a
dismissal
for
damages
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
lack
of
jurisdiction
of
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
that
a
damages
action?
