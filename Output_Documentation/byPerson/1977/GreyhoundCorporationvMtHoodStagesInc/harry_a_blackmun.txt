is
it
on
that
basis
that
you
distinguish
the
minnesota
mining
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
that
is
the
point
of
my
inquiry,
that
it
was
government
instituted.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i'll
take
up
the
latter
one
first.
this
is
an
antitrust
case
that
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
petitioner
greyhound
and
the
respondent
mt.
hood
stages
are
motor
common
carriers
and
they're
subject
to
regulation
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
mt.
hood
operates
over
routes
in
oregon,
and
idaho
and
utah;
and
greyhound
is
the
largest
common
carrier
by
bus
in
the
united
states.
the
two
are
competitors
in
the
northwest
section
of
our
country.
in
1964,
mt.
hood
instituted
a
proceeding
before
the
icc
against
greyhound
alleging
that
greyhound,
when
it
had
earlier
acquired
several
bus
companies
in
the
northwest
area
with
icc
approval,
had
not
lived
up
to
representations
it
made
in
the
commission
proceedings.
mt.
hood
therefore,
asked
the
commission
to
reopen
those
acquisition
proceedings
and
the
united
states
petitioned
for
leave
to
intervene.
the
government
stated
in
general
terms
that
mt.
hood's
allegations
made
a
serious
charge
and
deserved
a
hearing.
the
commission's
hearing
examiner
resolved
all
the
factual
issues
against
greyhound
and
it
ordered
greyhound
to
abide
by
the
representations
it
had
made
in
the
acquisition
proceedings.
later
in
1968,
mt.
hood
filed
an
antitrust
action
against
greyhound
in
federal
court.
the
jury
found
that
greyhound
indeed
had
violated
the
sherman
act
and
the
issue
then
became
a
matter
of
remedy.
the
district
court
held
that
the
intervention
by
the
united
states
in
the
commission
proceedings
served
to
toll
the
statute
of
limitations
under
section
5
of
the
clayton
act,
and
the
result
in
the
court's
view
was
that
the
act's
four-year-period
of
limitations
extended
all
the
way
back
to
1960
where
it
was
combined
with
fraudulent
concealment
allegations
to
create
a
20-year
damages
period.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
this
ruling
and
held
that
the
literal
wording
of
section
5
was
not
controlling.
it
also
held
that
the
government's
petitioner
to
intervene
was
what
it
called
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
direct
action
by
the
united
states.
the
issue
before
us
is
the
tolling
issue.
we
hold
that
the
clayton
act's
statute
of
limitation
was
not
tolled
by
the
filing
of
the
government's
petition
to
intervene
in
the
icc
proceeding.
that
proceeding
was
plainly
one
not
instituted
by
the
united
states
within
the
meaning
of
section
(5)
(i).
indeed
the
government
was
not
in
position
to
institute
the
icc
proceeding
and
nether
did
the
united
states
complain
of,
to
use
the
statute
words,
anything
on
which
the
district
court
action
was
based.
so
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
therefore
vacated
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
the
opinion
we
have
filed
today.
i'm
authorized
to
say
that
the
chief
justice
though
joined
in
the
opinion
with
great
reluctance,
has
filed
a
separate
concurring
opinion.
