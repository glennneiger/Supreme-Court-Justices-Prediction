justice
potter
stewart
did
the
government
or
the
anti-trust
division
have
an
absolute
right
of
intervention
in
the
icc
proceedings?
justice
potter
stewart
did
its
petition
recite
the
purpose
of
its
intervention
or
of
its
motion
for
leave
to
intervene?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
need
in
the
light
of
the
broader
enforcement
procedures
of
the
anti-trust
laws
for
the
anti-trust
division
to
intervene
in
these
administrative
proceedings
as
a
predicate
to
later
bringing
suit
under
the
anti-trust
laws?
is
there
any
concept
of
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
or
anything
that
can
do
that?
justice
potter
stewart
anytime,
with
or
without
any
motion
for
leave
to
intervene
in
these
icc
proceedings?
justice
potter
stewart
just
to
follow
up
on
my
brother
marshall's
question,
first
of
all,
apparently
you
acknowledge
that
there
was
no
prayer
for
relief
in
the
government's
original
petition
for
leave?
justice
potter
stewart
what
relief
could
the
interstate
commerce
commission
could
have
given
in
this
proceeding?
what
anti-trust
relief?
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
interstate
commerce
commission
have
as
such
the
power
or
the
function
of
enforcing
the
anti-trust
laws
and
giving
anti-trust
relief
as
such
or
is
it
confined
to
simply
considering
the
anti-trust
laws
and
in
administering
the
interstate
commerce
act?
justice
potter
stewart
it
cannot
award
treble
damages.
justice
potter
stewart
can
it
enjoin
action
as
in
violation
of
the
anti-trust
laws
without
any
reference
at
all
to
the
interstate
commerce
act?
justice
potter
stewart
without
reference
to
its
duties
under
the
interstate
commerce
act,
it
is
a
creature
of
the
interstate
commerce
act?
justice
potter
stewart
and
its
basic
function
is
to
enforce
that
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
true
that
the
part
you
read
does
not
refer
to
the
anti-trust
law?
justice
potter
stewart
they
refer
to
section
216,
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
what
about
damages
however?
justice
potter
stewart
what
about
damages?
you
were
free
to
seek
damages.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
united
states
of
america
could,
at
any
time,
have
filed
an
anti-trust
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court?
justice
potter
stewart
which
will
be
the
paradigm
example
of
the
application
of
69,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
but
they
made
an
improper
assertion.
they
are
wrong
on
that,
but
you
could,
i
believe,
have
filed
suit
in
1964
for
damages
for
the
preceding
period
if
you
wanted
to
do
so?
justice
potter
stewart
not
if
you
had
not
also
been
prosecuting
an
icc
proceeding
which
you
did
not
have
to
do.
i
cannot
understand
why
you
did
it.
i
think
it
was
good
representation
of
your
client,
but
you
at
least
had
the
option.
if
you
wanted
to,
you
could
have
said
"let
us
take
our
damages
for
past
action
and
file
a
supplemental
complaint
five
years
from
now
if
they
keep
doing
the
same
thing."
