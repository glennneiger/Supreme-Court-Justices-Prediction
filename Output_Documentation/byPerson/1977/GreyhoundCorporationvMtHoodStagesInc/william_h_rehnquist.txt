that
certainly
was
congress'
view
too,
do
you
not
think,
in
enacting
1969?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
the
reason
for
that
not
that
the
superior
resources
at
the
disposal
of
the
government
may
unravel
a
lot
of
things
that
private
plaintiffs
by
themselves
could
not
unravel,
and
therefore,
it
is
reasonable
to
let
private
plaintiffs
ride
on
a
tail
of
an
action
that
was
brought
by
the
government?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
crew,
you
say
you
find
somewhat
implied
in
the
government's
pleading
in
this
case
a
prayer
for
relief.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
implied
prayer
sought
relief
over
and
above
that
which
mt.
hood
sought?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
government
sought
no
more
in
its
prayer
and
intervention,
is
what
you
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
crew,
going
back
for
a
moment
to
your
response
to
my
brother
marshall's
question
as
to
the
status
of
an
intervener
once
it
gets
in,
turning
to
the
appendix
at
page
43
which
is
the
icc's
order
to
allow
intervention,
the
second
paragraph
of
that
order
says
that
intervention
is
allowed,
but
the
permission
to
intervene
herein
granted
shall
not
be
construed
to
allow
interveners
to
introduce
evidence
which
will
unduly
broaden
the
issues
raised
in
this
proceeding.
that
is
a
somewhat
limited
intervention
status
that
the
icc
granted
to
the
government,
is
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay,
but
then
take
your
position
in
this
case
which
is
that
the
statute
is
tolled
while
the
government
prosecutes
its
case
against
the
wrongdoer
under
the
anti-trust
laws
and
here
you
are
seeking
to
invoke
that
general
rule
on
the
basis
of
a
proceeding
which
was
begun
by
the
private
plaintiff
who
initiated
the
proceedings
before
the
commission
and
the
government
simply
came
in
to
say
"we
agree
with
the
private
plaintiff,"
is
that
not
standing
a
thing
on
its
head?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
it
thought
it
was
being
destroyed
by
anti-competitive
conduct,
violating
the
anti-trust
laws
when
it
brought
this
action
before
the
icc,
was
it
not
also
under
a
duty
if
it
intended
to
prosecute
a
damages
action
in
the
federal
court
to
move
within
the
time
provided
by
the
statute
of
limitations?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
