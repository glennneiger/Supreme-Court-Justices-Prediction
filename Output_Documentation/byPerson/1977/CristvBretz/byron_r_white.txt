mr.
keller,
let
me,
before
you
get
too
deeply
into
this,
do
i
understand
that
cline
has
wanted
a
reversal
of
his
conviction?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
not
the
case
moot
as
to
him
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
they
are
not
going
to
dismiss
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
seems
to
me
he
wants
everything
in
the
state
appeal
that
he
could
possibly
get
in
habeas?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
conviction
is
only
reversed
on
two
counts?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
no
bar
for
–
is
there
any
–
there
is
no
bar
under
montana
law
for
the
refilling
of
those
recounts?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
the
ones
they
dismissed.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
ones
the
prosecution
dismissed,
those
--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
montana,
does
the
judge
impose
a
sentence?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
some
of
your
double
jeopardy
considerations
then
apply
even
to
a
bench
trial,
i
am
thinking
of
the
opening
statement,
stress
and
anxiety
and
the
possible
impression
upon
the
trier
of
the
fact?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
not
all
of
those
considerations
kind
of
exempt
the
rule
that
jeopardy
attaches
before
the
first
witness
is
sworn?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
am
just
not
following
you
in
trying
to
draw
the
distinction
between
the
two?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
the
--
that
is
the
swearing
--
that
it
is
claimed
jeopardy
--
jeopardy
attaches?
justice
byron
r.
white
some
have
argued
it
ought
to
--
some
have
argued
that
--
that
jeopardy
ought
to
--
ought
to
attach
earlier?
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
his
interest
in
the
particular
jury
that
he
has
--
that
he
has
chosen
and
that
--
that
is
now
sworn
and
is
ready
to
hear
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
mean
non-evidentiary
reasons?
he
wants
it
because
he
thinks
this
is
the
jury
that
would
do
best
with
the
evidence
that
he
is
going
to
introduce?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
maybe
speculating,
but
--
but
--
but
the
defendant
has
spent
a
long
time
in
picking
the
jury
and
he
thinks
he
has
got
a
good
one
and
the
courts
before
its
sworn,
i
suppose
you
could
say,
if
something
that
blew
up
the
trial,
there
would
not
be
any
double
jeopardy
attachment.
he
--
once
it
is
sworn,
the
jury
processes
is
--
is
completed
--
and
here
is
a
jury
that
the
defendant’s
counsel
is
convinced
that
is
going
to
be
a
very
--
maybe
a
very
biased
jury.
he
is
convinced
that
it
will
be
biased
in
his
favor.
you
--
you
cannot
say
that
it
is
not
a
substantial
interest
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
defendant
is
convinced
that
this
--
he
just
is
very
convinced
that
this
is
an
impartial
jury
and
sometimes
his
--
his
lawyer
knows
or
have
not
been
the
impartial
juries
and
he
thinks
--
but
he
thinks
he
has
got
one
now
and
would
like
to
keep
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
depends
on
when
--
that
depends
on
when
you
decide
double
jeopardy
--
when
you
decide
jeopardy
attaches?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
--
well,
i
know,
but
you
want
to
--
you
want
to
reassess,
maybe
we
should
reassess
it
forward?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
far,
it
makes
more
sense
--
what
you
have
said
it
makes
more
sense
to
move
it
forward
to
the
--
when
you
begin
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
over
the
years
than
later?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
you
said
--
you
said
in
one
of
the
interests
protected
is
to
save
the
defendant
from
--
from
money,
anxiety
and
time
of
doing
--
going
through
it
twice,
and
so
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
going
through
a
trial
twice
or
going
through
a
criminal
proceeding
twice,
and
it
may
take
a
couple
of
weeks
to
select
a
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
yet?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
are
not
insisting
on
going
to
trial.
very
understandably,
you
were
doing
everything
you
could
do
to
get
the
indictments
dismissed,
so
you
would
not
go
to
trial?
