mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
with
the
court’s
permission,
there
are
two
issues
in
this
case
that
i
do
not
intend
to
discuss.
first
is
the
question
of
manifest
necessity.
as
we
noted
in
our
opening
brief,
the
record
in
this
case,
does
not
permit
a
determination
of
a
number
of
factors
essential
to
a
resolution
on
manifest
necessity
issue.
since
it
does
not
indicate
whether
appellees
resisted
the
amendment
of
count
two
of
the
initial
information
or
whether
they
objected
to
the
dismissal
of
that
count
or
to
the
dismissal
of
the
remaining
counts.
in
any
event,
the
state
appears
to
have
abandoned
that
issue
in
this
court.
the
second
question
that
i
do
not
plan
to
address
at
any
length,
is
whether
the
state
should
be
free
to
adopt
a
rule
for
the
attachment
of
jeopardy
that
differs
from
the
rule
applicable
in
federal
courts,
is
not
a
matter
in
which
the
federal
government
has
a
substantial
interest.
it
is
our
view,
however,
that
there
is
little
to
justify
disparity
in
the
rule
as
applied
to
state
and
federal
courts.
the
double
jeopardy
prohibition
of
the
fifth
amendment
is
of
course
fully
enforceable
against
the
states
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
time
when
jeopardy
attaches
would
appear
to
be
an
essential
ingredient
of
the
double
jeopardy
guarantee
rather
than
a
mere
incidental
or
procedural
feature
that
may
be
varied
without
doing
damage
to
the
basic
constitutional
right.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
the
issue
that
is
of
concern
to
the
united
states
is
when
this
jeopardy
attaches
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law.
if
the
court
were
then
to
hold
that
the
states
may
be
free
to
vary,
that
portion
of
the
court’s
opinion
would
be
of
no
substantial
interest
to
the
united
states.
i
would
like
to
limit
my
discussion
then
to
the
essential
question
posed
by
the
court
in
its
order
of
december
5th,
that
is
when
as
the
matter
of
constitutional
mandate,
does
jeopardy
attach?
now,
at
--
at
common
law,
as
mr.
keller
has
indicated,
indeed
even
today
in
england
jeopardy
did
not
attach
until
verdict.
the
historical
record
leaves
little
doubt
that
this
was
the
understanding
of
the
framers
to
the
fifth
amendment
and
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
was
not
originally
intended
to
bar
the
re-prosecution
of
the
defendant
whose
first
trial
was
aborted
for
whatever
reasons,
prior
to
verdict.
despite
this
background,
it
is
settled
today
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
more
than
a
mere
constitutionalization
of
res
judicata
principles,
plus
the
prohibition
of
government
appeals
from
acquittals.
the
clause
also
protects
the
“defendant’s
valued
right”
as
this
court
has
said
in
a
number
of
occasions,
to
have
this
trial
completed
once
it
has
begun.
in
other
words,
a
right
to
go
to
verdict
and
perhaps
to
end
the
dispute
then
and
there
with
an
acquittal.
obviously,
in
order
to
protect
the
defendant’s
interest
in
receiving
the
verdict
of
the
first
fact-finder
and
hence
avoiding
repetitive
trials,
jeopardy
must
attach
at
some
point
prior
to
the
verdict.
question
then
is
that
what
point
in
a
criminal
proceeding
does
the
defendant’s
interest
in
going
forward
with
a
trial
to
its
completion
and
not
being
required
to
begin
a
new,
becomes
sufficiently
substantial
to
support
the
conclusion
that
jeopardy
has
attached
and
accordingly,
that
subsequent
trial
terminations
must
be
judged
under
the
unyielding
requirements
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
in
fixing
this
point,
we
believe
that
the
court
should
be
guided
by
three
considerations.
first
consideration,
which
was
alluded
to
earlier
by
mr.
justice
stevens,
is
that
the
time
of
the
attachment
of
jeopardy
should
represent
the
bright
line.
this
is
an
area
in
which
the
need
for
certainty
and
predictability
is
especially
important.
unless
the
point
at
which
the
defendant
has
been
placed
in
jeopardy
can
be
identified
with
precision
in
every
trial,
judges
would
be
forced
to
guess
as
to
the
propriety
of
terminating
the
proceedings
prematurely,
in
a
situation
perhaps
not
amounting
to
manifest
necessity.
an
incorrect
assessment
may
leave
to
--
lead
to
immunity
for
a
defendant
whose
guilt
is
capable
of
establishment.
for
these
reasons,
we
doubt
that
the
tests
offered
by
the
state
in
this
case,
which
appears
to
depend,
first
upon
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
that
had
been
introduced,
and
now
when
the
defendant’s
lawyer
may
have
committed
himself
in
some
way,
or
in
professor
schulhofer’s
recent
article,
which
is
relied
on
by
appellee
cline,
which
depends
in
part
upon
a
necessarily
subjective
view
of
the
difficulties
encountered
in
voir
dire,
i
doubt
whether
either
of
those
tests
would
be
workable.
the
second,
we
believe
that
jeopardy
should
attach
at
the
same
point
in
jury
and
non-jury
trials.
as
this
court
observed
in
jenkins,
the
double
jeopardy
clause
nowhere
distinguishes
between
jury
and
bench
trials.
the
defendant’s
risk
of
conviction
is
precisely
the
same
in
either
type
of
trial
and
whether
the
fact-finder
is
the
judge
or
the
jury,
defendant
has
the
identical
fifth
amendment
interest
in
completing
the
trial,
hopefully
with
an
acquittal
once
it
has
begun.
finally,
the
point
that
selected
for
the
attachment
of
jeopardy
must
be
responsive
to
the
evils
of
re-prosecution
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
was
historically
designed
to
prevent,
that
is
the
anxieties,
the
strain
and
expense
suffered
by
the
defendant
who
is
forced
to
undergo
repetitive
trials,
the
possibility
of
manipulation
or
harassment
by
a
prosecutor,
particularly
the
chance
of
a
second
opportunity
to
convict
the
defendant
if
the
first
trial
is
viewed
as
proceeding
unfavorable.
now,
with
those
three
underlying
principles
in
mind,
the
united
states
believes
that
the
constitution
does
not
require
jeopardy
to
attach
in
any
case,
state
or
federal,
jury
or
non-jury,
until
the
fact-finder
first
begins
to
receive
evidence.
only
when
the
government
begins
to
meet
its
burden
of
establishing
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
defendant
committed
the
crime
charged,
can
it
truly
be
said
that
the
defendant
faces
the
risk
of
conviction
and
it
is
the
risk
of
conviction
that
this
court
stated
in
reid
against
jones
that
the
constitutional
concept
of
jeopardy
connotes.
the
point
at
which
evidence
going
to
the
general
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence
is
produced,
marks
a
convenient
and
we
believe
logical
boundary
in
every
criminal
case,
separating
pre-trial
preliminaries
which
concededly
do
not
deserve
the
protections
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
from
the
trial
itself.
the
rule
of
jeopardy
attaches
when
the
fact-finder
begins
to
hear
evidence,
which
is
the
--
of
course
the
rule
that
has
traditionally
been
applied
in
bench
trials,
fully
accommodates
the
defendant’s
fifth
amendment
interest.
prior
to
the
introduction
of
evidence,
the
defendant’s
interest
in
avoiding
re-prosecution
ordinarily
is
very
weak.
he
has
not
yet
suffered
any
of
the
strains
or
emotional
distress
associated
with
being
forced
to
undergo
a
criminal
trial.
moreover,
the
defendant
has
little,
if
any,
stake
at
that
pre-evidentiary
stage
in
proceeding
to
a
verdict
in
order
to
preserve
any
fact-findings
that
the
finder
of
the
fact
may
have
made
in
his
favor.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
we
do
not
believe
that
the
interest
in
preserving
a
particular
jury
for
non-evidentiary
reasons
is
an
interest
that
is
protected
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
first
objection
is
that,
that
is
highly
speculative.
at
least
when
evidence
begins
to
be
introduced,
we
can
assess
what
sort
of
impact
it
might
have
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i
can
say
it
is
not
a
substantial
interest
protected
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
i
can
agree
with
you,
mr.
justice
white,
that
it
may
be
a
substantial
interest
of
the
defendant
that
is
entitled
to
protection,
perhaps
even
a
constitutional
protection.
and
if
for
example,
a
prosecutor
sought
to
abort
the
trial
after
the
jury
had
been
selected,
but
before
evidence
began
because
he
thought
that
the
finder
of
fact
would
be
unduly
favorable
to
the
defendant,
there
might
well
be
remedies
for
a
defendant
in
that
situation,
either
under
the
jury
trial
clause
of
the
sixth
amendment,
or
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
obviously
it
guarantees
him
a
fair
jury.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
am
not
disputing
that
that
maybe
a
substantial
interest
of
the
defendants.
i
think
the
task
for
this
court
is
to
determine
whether
that
is
an
interest
protected
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause
instead
of
perhaps
the
speedy
--
the
jury
trial
clause
or
the
due
process
clause.
i
think
there
is
substantial
evidence
that
it
is
not
an
interest
protected
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
for
one,
as
you
alluded
to
a
moment
ago,
mr.
justice
white,
if
the
prosecutor
at
the
voir
dire
or
when
the
venire
comes
into
the
courtroom
or
even
after
the
jury
has
been
selected,
but
before
it
has
been
sworn,
does
something
to
abort
the
trial
because
he
thinks
that
the
jury
is
unduly
favorable
to
the
defendant.
there
is
absolutely
no
double
jeopardy
analysis
of
his
actions,
although
there
may
well
be
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
the
law
is
developed
in
the
last
200
years
to
--
to
now,
the
current
understanding
which
i
assume
this
court
has
prepared
to
reassess
in
this
case,
such
that
in
jury
trial
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
that
the
court
should
reassess
the
entire
area
and
decide
where
logically
in
light
of
the
history
if
the
double
jeopardy
clause
that
is
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
but
only
if
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i
think
it
should
be
obvious,
i
think
to
the
court
at
this
point
that
based
upon
how
the
court
defines
the
interest
protected
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
it
becomes
relatively
easy
to
fix
the
point
for
the
attachment
of
jeopardy.
in
other
words,
if
the
court
finds
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
in
fact
protects
the
defendant’s
interest
in
favorable
jury
selection,
then
jeopardy
should
obviously
attach
at
or
prior
to
the
selection
of
the
jury.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
going
through
a
trial
twice.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it
maybe,
it
may
take
several
--
several
weeks
to
litigate
a
pre-trial
suppression
motion
or
a
number
of
other
pre-trial
preliminaries,
but
no
one
has
ever
suggested
that
the
defendant
has
a
double
jeopardy
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
not
yet.[laughter]
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
significance
in
the
use
of
the
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
assume
that
means
whether
any
of
the
litigants
wants
to
exercise
any
further
challenges
for
clause,
whether
the
--
whether
they
do
not
believe
that
the
jury
that
has
been
selected
is
favorable.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i
am
sure
it
varies
case
to
case,
justice
marshall,
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
practice
in
the
trial
courts
in
every
state
or
in
the
federal
courts,
and
i
do
not
believe
that
that
is
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no.
i
think
what
--
what
is
important
is
--
is
not
that
the
litigant
has
or
have
an
attempt
to
pick
a
favorable
jury,
but
that
he
had
attempts
as
chief
justice
said,
to
pick
an
impartial
jury.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
the
history
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
indeed
justice’s
story
says
that
the
first
trial
did
not
end
in
a
conviction
or
an
acquittal.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
that
is
correct.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
the
purpose
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
to
prevent
repetitive
trials.
that
may
happen
by
a
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
after
a
conviction
or
an
acquittal,
but
they
--
they
equally
happen,
i
assume,
if
partway
down
the
trial,
the
prosecutor
decides
to
abort
it
and
start
again,
and
as
again
they
put
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
it
was
not
until
1963,
that
this
court
recognized
the
defendant’s
interest
in
not
having
to
go
through
it?
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
right.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
that,
that
is
--
i
think
that
may
be
right.
that
is
correct,
although
i
must
say
that
when
this
notion
that
jeopardy
attached
prior
to
verdict
crept
into
our
law,
is
one
of
the
substantial
mysteries
of
double
jeopardy
jurisprudence.
we
have
not
been
able
to
determine
when
precisely
the
--
the
thought
became
accepted
in
the
united
states
and
those
courts
that
have
applied
the
notion
have
not
seen
fit
to
explain
what
the
rationale
is
that
they
are
using
to
deviate
from
the
common
law.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is
correct.
there
has
to
be
a
verdict.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
it
does
not.
we
agree
that
jeopardy
must
attach
at
some
point
prior
--
prior
to
verdict
in
order
to
preserve
the
defendant’s
right,
not
to
have
to
go
through
unnecessarily
repetitive
trial.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
we
do.
we
agree
that
once
we
fix
the
point
at
which
jeopardy
attaches,
any
trial
terminations
after
that
point
should
be
judged
by
double
jeopardy
standards.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
it
is.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
that
the
manifest
necessity
notion
that
justice
black
was
articulating
in
wade
against
hunter
is
also
a
constitutional
notion.
in
other
words,
merely
finding
that
jeopardy
is
attached
and
that
the
trial
has
been
aborted,
does
not
end
the
analysis.
in
order
for
the
defendant
to
have
been
deprived
of
this
fifth
amendment
rights,
there
also
must
not
have
been
a
manifest
necessity
before
the
trial
termination.
thank
you.
