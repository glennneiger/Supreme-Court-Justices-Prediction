mr.
charles
f.
moses
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
may
i
suggest
to
the
court
a
different
area
for
discussion?
justice
stewart
brought
up
the
issue
of
the
origin
of
the
valued
right.
i
think
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
is
one
of
the
important
issues
in
this
case.
i
think
the
question
that
is
raised
here,
where
it
says
that
no
state
shall
make
or
enforce
any
law
which
shall
abridge
the
privileges
and
immunities
of
citizens
of
the
united
states,
that
the
history
of
that
amendment
in
1866,
while
through
the
adamson
case
of
justice
black,
which
started
the
incorporation
theory
is
a
relevant
issue
here.
should
the
court
adopt
a
position
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
the
states
should
follow
case
by
case,
jot
by
jot,
under
the
incorporation
theory
--
mr.
charles
f.
moses
yes,
he
wrote
a
dissenting
opinion
and
what
he
did
in
the
dissenting
opinion
mr.
justice
rehnquist
was
to
set
forth
all
of
the
congressional
proceedings
where
bingham,
the
congressman
in
1866
said,
“i
sponsored
or
i
wrote
this
fourteenth
amendment
because
of
the
case
of
barron
versus
baltimore
which
said
simply
that
the
first
8
amendments
applied
only
to
the
federal
government.”
so
that
the
construction
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
i
think
has
a
measure
of
importance
here.
the
reason
that
i
say
that
because
if
it
is
in
origin,
a
privilege
or
immunity
that
is
not
rare
or
abstract,
but
is
something
that
is
recognized
by
the
courts,
then
that
is
something
that
should
be
enforced
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
raise
that
issue
because
i
think
that
then,
the
federal
and
the
state
would
have
the
same
privileges
and
immunities.
it
would
be
consistent
with
the
supremacy
clause
as
we
understand
it,
the
law
of
the
land,
the
bench
and
the
bar
would
know
exactly
what
the
rule
was
and
i
think
that
that
is
important.
the
reason
that
i
mention
that
is
because
of
the
second
issue,
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
that
is
not
the
privileges
and
immunities,
but
is
the
due
process
section
and
it
seems
to
me
as
i
read
the
cases,
that
we
will
apply
to
the
states
through
the
fourteenth
amendment
those
constitutional
rights
the
court
deems
fundamental,
and
thus
apply
federal
statutes.
it
is
a
selective
incorporation
as
i
see
it.
it
seems
to
me
that
benton
versus
maryland,
which
is
an
important
case
on
the
issue
of
jeopardy,
raises
that
issue
of
selective
incorporation.
in
other
words,
what
we
are
saying
is
that
under
the
due
process
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
that
double
jeopardy
is
a
fundamental
right.
we
can
agree
upon
that,
but
that
is
not
the
end
of
the
inquiry.
is
the
time
it
attaches
simply
non-constitutional
baggage?
if
we
are
going
to
be
selective
in
our
incorporation
of
the
first
8
amendments,
and
of
course,
that
raises
the
question
of
whether
it
is
implicit
in
the
right
given.
i
would
like
to
use
the
word
parsing
or
pick
a
part.
jeopardy
attaches
when
the
jury
is
empaneled
and
sworn.
if
you
just
say,
jeopardy
attaches
and
leave
out
when
the
jury
is
empaneled
and
sworn,
then
i
think
the
language
is
meaningless.
it
does
not
make
sense.
you
are
going
to
have
to
say
that
jeopardy
attaches
either
when
the
jury
is
empaneled
and
sworn
to
make
it
complete
or
when
the
state
says
it
does
or
when
the
first
witness,
so
that
i
think
it
is
implicit
even
under
the
selective
incorporation
rule.
there
has
been
a
lot
of
opposition
to
this
incorporation
doctrine.
justice
stewart
has
written
upon
it.
one
of
the
things
that
i
think
has
to
be
decided
is
whether
we
are
going
to
reject
the
incorporation
theory
entirely
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
i
think
that
is
relevant
to
this
particular
decision.
the
first
8
amendments
are
only
applicable
to
federal
proceedings.
any
school
boy
knows
that.
states
may
adopt
a
rule
and
states
may
adopt
any
standard
they
wish,
subject
only
to
the
strictures
of
their
own
state
law
or
constitutions
in
the
fundamental
fairness
test.
you
may
want
to
adopt
that.
now,
if
that
--
if
that
is
done,
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
a
chancellor's
foot
standard
and
we
are
going
back
to
palko
and
twining.
i
think
those
are
the
issues
in
my
judgment
in
this
case
is
the
application
of
the
due
process
clause,
whether
we
are
going
to
have
complete
incorporation,
selective
incorporation,
or
rejection
of
the
incorporation
doctrine.
one
of
the
difficulties,
if
i
may
add
this
to
my
argument
very
briefly,
is
that
there
is
great
uncertainty
in
the
law.
lawyers
do
not
know
how
to
advise
their
clients?
lawyers
do
not
know
how
to
argue
before
the
courts
because
they
simply
do
not
know
what
the
law
is?
that
is
why
i
--
i
think
there
should
be
some
certainty
in
the
law.
we
have
in
montana,
for
instance,
take
winship
on
reasonable
doubt,
it
is
a
requirement.
in
montana,
we
do
not
have
that
rule.
we
have
a
different
rule,
a
higher
probability
of
its
existence
as
to
one
of
the
essential
elements.
which
rule
do
you
follow?
we
have
the
presumption
of
innocence.
we
have
us
versus
castles,
which
is
a
federal
case
in
which
i
was
involved
in.
we
have
the
statutory
signs
as
waiver
provision
in
my
view.
we
have
had
difficulty
and
i
have
had
difficulty
in
another
state
with
brady
versus
maryland.
the
court
has
simply
said,
“we
do
not
accept
brady.
we
do
not
accept
it,
because
our
statute
does
not
provide
for
it.
”it
took
two
months
to
trial
almost
and
the
case
was
finally
reversed
on
the
basis
that
the
supreme
court
finally
straightened
out,
the
district
court
on
brady
versus
maryland.
we
are
eliminating
or
have
legislation
to
eliminate
search
and
seizure
in
the
state
of
montana,
almost
got
by
in
the
last
legislation
session.
mr.
charles
f.
moses
well,
eliminate
the
prohibitions
of
the
fourth
amendment.
i
want
to
be
very
dogmatic
about
that.
i
am
not
talking
about
eliminating
the
remedy
of
the
exclusionary
rules.
mr.
charles
f.
moses
i
am
saying
eliminate
search
and
seizure,
now
that
is
my
opinion,
my
judgment.
mr.
charles
f.
moses
there
would
be
no
--
there
would
be
no
penalty
as
far
as
due
process
is
concerned
with
respect
to
how
the
evidence
was
obtained,
in
the
courts
in
montana.
mr.
charles
f.
moses
no
exclusionary
rules.
that
may
be
a
good
idea,
but
the
rule
is
--
the
question
is
that
we
go
from
the
very
basic
discovery,
reasonable
doubt,
presumption
of
innocence,
burden
of
proof,
search
and
seizure,
the
rule
in
the
state
of
montana
is
entirely
different,
and
we
do
not
know
as
practicing
attorneys,
what
rule
do
we
follow?
do
we
follow
the
federal
rule
because
it
is
a
matter
of
constitutional
importance
under
the
supremacy
clause
or
do
we
follow
the
state
statute?
it
is
a
difficult
problem
from
my
point
of
view.
now,
finally,
to
end
my
statement
because
i
wanted
to
address
the
court’s
attention
simply
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
let
me
end
by
saying
that
i
disagree
with
my
friend,
mr.
keller.
i
--
in
the
last
two
years,
i
have
decided
that
i
make
all
opening
statements
at
the
beginning
of
the
case.
i
just
had
a
murder
case
with
a
battered
woman
syndrome
and
i
wanted
the
jury
to
hear
about
the
battered
woman
syndrome
at
the
earliest
possible
time
before
the
shooting
in
the
back
testimony
came
to
the
floor.
i
had
a
good
reason
for
it,
but
i
am
now
almost
exclusively
making
opening
statements.
secondly,
it
is
true
in
the
practice
in
montana
that
the
judge
is
now
permitted
to
give
instructions
to
aid
and
assist
the
jury
in
the
fair
consideration
of
the
case
as
they
sit
there,
and
that
is
a
good
idea
and
that
occurs
before
the
first
witness
is
sworn.
my
conclusion
to
that
court
is
this.
the
rule
i
think
is
of
constitutional
significance
as
a
matter
of
fact,
what
i
would
like
to
do
if
i
may
--
let
me
read
you
an
opinion
in
order
that
i
think
would
be
appropriate
in
this
case.
“the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution
is
a
fundamental
constitutional
right.
jeopardy,
as
we
have
said,
attaches
when
the
jury
is
empaneled
and
sworn.
anything
in
the
constitution
or
laws
of
any
state
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding,
the
decision
is
affirmed.”
that
is
what
i
would
propose.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
mr.
charles
f.
moses
in
essence,
that
is
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
what
the
judge
does
now
under
the
current
practice,
is
simply
give
the
jury
those
necessary
instructions
that
it
feels
is
appropriate
to
guide
the
jury
under
the
--
as
it
sits
there.
for
instance,
the
presumption
of
innocence
rule
and
that
you
may
not
form
or
express
any
opinion
as
to
the
merits
of
the
case,
that
you
are
the
sole
judges
of
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses,
things
of
that
kind.
so
they
really
know
what
they
are
supposed
to
do,
but
that
occurs
after
the
jury
is
empaneled
and
sworn
and
before
the
first
witness
takes
the
stand.
mr.
charles
f.
moses
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
f.
moses
no
sir.
mr.
charles
f.
moses
that
was
only
one
--
that
was
only
one
of
the
grounds
for
dismissal,
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
charles
f.
moses
of
one
of
the
counts,
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
f.
moses
there
were
five
other
counts
that
were
good.
mr.
charles
f.
moses
i
was
counsel
at
the
time
and
it
was
not
a
kind
of
tactical
stroke,
sir.
mr.
charles
f.
moses
we
have
--
let
me
tell
you
exactly
what
happened.
i
had
raised
the
issue
as
to
the
--
whether
the
offenses
or
any
of
them
stated
a
--
a
criminal
offense
as
to
all
of
the
counts.
i
had
raised
substantial
objections
and
they
were
overruled
without
the
court
ever
reading
the
brief.
once,
the
jury
was
empaneled
and
sworn,
i
raised
that
same
issue
again,
the
same
issue
and
i
still
contend
that
there
were
no
sufficient
grounds
to
state
a
public
offense
as
to
all
of
the
counts.
at
that
particular
time,
i
think
they
moved
to
amend,
to
have
a
particular
date
and
of
course,
i
objected,
but
my
objection
and
i
--
i
also
requested
at
that
time
that
we
go
to
the
supreme
court
and
have
this
all
resolved,
but
the
supreme
court
when
the
application
was
made
by
the
attorney
general
to
go
to
the
supreme
court
after
they
refused
to
allow
the
amendment
and
some
other
changes,
the
supreme
court
refused
and
said,
“go
back
and
try
it.”
then
they
came
into
court
and
said,
“we
are
going
to
dismiss
them
all,
all
of
them.”
i
think
there
were
five
other
good
counts,
at
least,
then
they
dismissed
them
all
and
were
starting
again
and
the
record
is
plain
that
i
objected
in
writing
--
i
am
sorry,
i
did
not
object
in
writing,
the
record
is
clear
that
i
objected
at
that
time.
so
it
was
not,
to
that
extent
a
--
a
tactical
maneuver
on
my
part,
mr.
justice
powell.
i
was
there
because
the
--
the
charges
were
not
any
good
in
my
judgment
and
i
wanted
to
go
to
the
supreme
court
to
prove
that.
the
supreme
court
would
not
hear
it
and
during
that
course
of
time,
they
moved
to
amend
and
of
course,
i
objected
them
--
to
them
doing
anything.
that
is
the
way
it
occurred.
mr.
charles
f.
moses
in
my
judgment,
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
moses
you
bet,
that
is
exactly
correct.
mr.
charles
f.
moses
that
--
that
is
precisely
correct,
sir.
mr.
charles
f.
moses
i
have
a
personal
prejudice
about
that,
sir.
in
my
--
in
my
opinion,
being
the
trial
counsel,
the
reason
overall
that
it
was
dismissed,
they
had
five
other
good
charges.
the
reason
that
it
was
dismissed
is
that
the
prosecution
felt
they
had
a
lousy
jury.
i
thought
we
killed
them
on
voir
dire
as
to
what
the
issues
were
and
then
we
had
a
good
jury.
this
is
at
the
capital
where
you
have
state
employees
and
--
and
things
of
that
kind
and
in
selecting
the
jury,
i
thought
we
had
a
good
jury.
i
think
the
prosecution
thought
they
had
a
lousy
jury
and
which
--
mr.
charles
f.
moses
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
moses
yes,
i
was
insisting
we
go
to
trial.
i
raised
my
objections,
i
--
judge
turns
me
down.
mr.
charles
f.
moses
oh!
yes.
i
--
i
had
moved
to
dismiss
because
of
the
fact
that
they
did
not
state
a
public
offense.
mr.
charles
f.
moses
oh!
yes,
yes
sir.
i
sure
did.
that
is
exactly
what
i
did.
it
was
my
judgment
at
that
time
that
those
counts
did
not
state
a
public
offense
and
i
moved
to
dismiss
at
very
stage
of
the
proceeding.
if
i
had
had
jeopardy
in
mind,
i
would
have
waited
until
the
first
witness
was
sworn.
i
would
not
have
raised
the
issue
then.
i
am
silly.
mr.
charles
f.
moses
you
bet.
yes,
i
was
trying
to
get
the
--
every
stage
of
the
proceeding,
i
was
objecting,
and
that
was
my
purpose.
thank
you.
