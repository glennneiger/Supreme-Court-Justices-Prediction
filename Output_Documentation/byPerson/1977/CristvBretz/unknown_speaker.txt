unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
before
you
sit
down,
you
in
your
brief
seem
have
to
abandoned
the
notion,
the
argument
on
manifest
necessity.
unknown
speaker
let
us
assume
you
are
wrong
on
your
thought
that
it
is
not
properly
here.
it
is
not
properly
subject
to
appellate
jurisdiction
here.
assume
you
are
wrong
on
that,
do
you
mean
--
would
you
mean
to
abandon
it
or
not?
unknown
speaker
under
what,
under
what
case?
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
abandon
it?
unknown
speaker
so
you
do
not
think
it
has
ever
been
presented
to
the
montana
supreme
court?
unknown
speaker
so
there
has
been
no
or
is
there
any
necessity
for
that?
unknown
speaker
in
a
federal
habeas
corpus
proceeding,
is
there
any
necessity
for
you
to
in
order
to
argue
manifest
necessity
to
have
it
gone
through
the
state
system?
there
is
a
requirement
for
exhaustion
on
the
state,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well
then
why
do
you
say
that
the
manifest
necessity
is
not
properly
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
just
did
not
want
to
raise
it,
that
may
be
so,
but
what
if
you
lose
on
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
and
you
do
not
want
us
to
consider?
you
do
not
want
that
issue
of
manifest
necessity
adjudicated
here,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
so
you
do
not
think
it
is
worth
anything
under
lee,
did
you
read
the
lee
case?
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
think
it
is
worth
anything
under
lee?
unknown
speaker
he
does
not
seem
to
agree
with
you
it
is
such
a
weak
point?
unknown
speaker
because
he
would
sustain
â€“
he
would
think
that
there
was
manifest
necessity
if
the
merits
are
reached
here?
unknown
speaker
we
have
got
enough
issues
without
reaching
for
one?
unknown
speaker
even
if
they
cannot
try
them
again,
even
if
they
do
not
try
him
again?
unknown
speaker
but
as
it
stands
right
now,
he
is
clean
with
the
state
and
there
is
no
charges
pending
against
him?
unknown
speaker
and
there
is
no
lingering
consequences
from
his
conviction?
unknown
speaker
can
i
ask
the
similar
question
much
the
same
way
i
suppose,
but
habeas
corpus
is
a
collateral
attack
on
the
judgment?
unknown
speaker
now,
what
judgment
is
outstanding
of
being
collaterally
attacked
by
your
client?
unknown
speaker
it
had
attached
as
to
a
judgment
which
has
now
been
set
aside?
unknown
speaker
now,
these
five
other
counts
have
never
been
reduced
to
judgment,
have
they?
unknown
speaker
how
can
they
provide
this
basis
for
collateral
attack?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that
case.
there
was
a
judgment
outstanding
that
was
involved
in
the
appeal.
the
judgment
survived
the
service
of
a
sentence,
but
that
does
not
hold
that
you
can
attack
a
non
existent
judgment,
the
judgment
entered
by
a
court?
unknown
speaker
may
be
items
for
related
offense
to
what
you
would
say,
well,
that
is
really
encompass
within
what
you
have
been
acquitted
over
something
like
that.
there
is
always
a
possibility
of
somebody
indicting
you
and
you
are
making
a
plea
and
abatement
or
claiming
bar,
claiming
double
jeopardy.
the
court
is
never
found
at
a
basis
for
collateral
attack
that
i
know
off?
unknown
speaker
mr.
moses,
may
i
interrupt
a
minute.
did
you
make
this
motion
before
the
jury
had
been
sworn?
did
you
make
the
motion
to
restrict
the
states
evidence?
unknown
speaker
could
you
have
made
it
under
montana
law
prior
to
the
swearing
of
the
jury?
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
in
montana
law
that
would
have
prevented
you
making
it?
unknown
speaker
the
information
was
defective
because
of
this
typographical
error
on
its
face?
unknown
speaker
what
was
your
motion
then?
unknown
speaker
but
the
jury
had
been
sworn?
unknown
speaker
but
the
motion
that
precipitated
the
controversy
that
is
here
today
was
to
restrict
evidence
to
the
dates
in
the
information
as
i
understand
it
--
unknown
speaker
the
effect
of
your
motion
was
to
bring
about
a
dismissal
of
the
information?
unknown
speaker
yes,
in
practical
effect
your
motion
was
to
dismiss
because
the
state
had
no
evidence
of
the
offense
that
was
charged?
unknown
speaker
is
your
motion
in
the
appendix,
i
do
not
recall?
i
do
not
think
it
is
in
--
unknown
speaker
and
mr.
keller,
when
actually
is
the
jury
sworn,
after
selection
or
as
the
panel
is
sworn?
unknown
speaker
and
before
the
12
are
chosen?
unknown
speaker
now
the
12
begin
--
after
the
12
are
chosen
or
later?
unknown
speaker
and
what
we
are
talking
about
--
unknown
speaker
and
that
each
one
--
each
one
individually
does
that?
do
you
swear
each
one
individually?
unknown
speaker
only
then,
not
to
--
unknown
speaker
well,
after
a
--
after
a
con
--
or
an
acquittal?
unknown
speaker
but
meanwhile
jeopardy
had
attached?
unknown
speaker
mr.
leaphart,
i
am
still
a
little
puzzled.
let
me
ask
what
i
asked
you
last
time?
why
are
you
here?
is
it
not
cline
out
of
this
case
now
entirely
and
is
in
the
case
moot
as
to
him?
unknown
speaker
but
we
are
familiar
with
those
cases,
but
i
just
wondered
what
substance
are
left
in
your
--
in
your
case?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
moved
to
dismiss
--
unknown
speaker
that
is
correct.
