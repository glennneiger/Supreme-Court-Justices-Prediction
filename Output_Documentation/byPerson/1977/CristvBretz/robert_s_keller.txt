mr.
robert
s.
keller
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
jurisdiction
has
been
reserved
in
this
case,
a
double
jeopardy
case
proceeding
out
of
montana.
we
are
proceeding
under
the
provisions
of
28
united
states
code
1254
(2).
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
effect
held
that
montana
statute
95-1711
taken
from
the
model
penal
code
was
unconstitutional.
1711
permits
a
retrial
if
the
first
trial
has
been
terminated
before
the
first
witness
is
sworn
as
distinguished
from
the
federal
rule
that
when
the
jury
is
empaneled
and
sworn.
some
of
the
facts
in
the
case
that
give
rise
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
this
proceeded
in
1974,
a
nine
count
information
against
bretz
and
cline
and
mrs.
cline,
and
she
is
not
relevant
to
this
appeal.
one
of
the
counts
and
one
of
the
gut
counts
was
obtaining
money
by
false
pretenses
alleged
to
have
occurred
between
january
and
february
of
1974.
after
the
jury
was
empaneled
and
sworn
the
defendants
moved,
made
several
motions,
but
a
motion
in
limine
to
confine
the
state
to
the
confines
of
the
information,
january
to
february
of
1974
and
unfortunately
a
typographical
error,
it
should
have
been
january
1973
to
february
1974.
it
put
the
trial
judge
in
a
dilemma
for
two
reasons.
the
state
moved
to
amend
to
correct
the
error
and
i
bring
this
up
because
justice
tuttle
in
the
ninth
circuit
commented
that
this
is
simply
a
formal
defect.
the
trial
judge
was
in
this
dilemma;
to
permit
the
amendment
meant
we
were
talking
an
additional
year
of
time
against
which
the
defendant
had
to
defend
at
the
last
minute.
secondly,
in
1973
the
montana
legislature
enacted
a
comprehensive
sweeping
montana
criminal
code
of
1973
that
repealed
all
preexisting
substantive
law
effective
january
1,
1974.
so
in
essence,
they
were
going
to
court
on
this
particular
count,
there
were
three
counts,
but
this
particular
one
on
an
offense
that
had
been
repealed
before
it
was
alleged
to
have
been
committed.
so
the
trial
court
was
in
a
real
dilemma
and
sua
sponte
dismissed
the
three
counts
that
had
the
typographical
error.
the
state
as
i
indicated
had
moved
to
amend,
and
this
had
been
strenuously
objected
to
by
the
defendants
and
that
is
when
the
court
sua
sponte
dismissed.
they
then
dismissed
the
remaining
six
counts.
the
state
that
of
its
own
motion
re
filed
a
new
information,
corrected
the
defect
and
filed
a
two
count
information.
the
first
count
was
grand
larceny
and
it
tracked
one
of
the
six
counts
that
the
state
had
moved
to
dismiss
of
its
own
motion
and
the
second
count
was
obtaining
money
by
false
pretenses
with
the
typographical
error
corrected
and
the
jury
found,
there
was
a
new
trial,
and
the
jury
found
the
defendants
guilty
of
this
obtaining
money
by
false
pretenses,
one
of
the
counts
had
the
typographical
error.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
it
is
the
jurisdiction,
that
is
correct
your
honor,
and
ordinarily
i
would
say
that,
that
is
my
position,
that
you
are
correct
except
that
in
one
of
the
appellees'
briefs,
the
bretz
brief,
they
contest
our
jurisdiction
saying
that
we
did
not
address
the
question
and
so
i
felt
that
under
the
rules
i
had
to
address
it
both
in
the
opening
shot
in
my
brief
and
in
opening
shot
in
oral
argument.
if
we
are
all
satisfied
in
the
jurisdiction,
and
i
want
to
assure
the
court
that
i
am
satisfied
that
we
are
under
1254
(2),
i
would
be
glad
to
go
on
to
the
--
mr.
robert
s.
keller
that
is
correct.
it
never
came
right
out
and
said
1711
is
unconstitutional.
it
just
said
the
montana
supreme
court
which
was
interpreting
that
statute
was
wrong
and
the
effect
of
it
is
that
it
is
unconstitutional.
our
statute
from
the
model
penal
code
specifically
says
that
jeopardy
in
essence
has
not
attached
and
can
have
a
retrial
up
until
the
time
the
first
witness
is
sworn
and
the
federal
rule
except
in
the
federal
system
is
at
the
time
that
the
jury
is
empaneled
and
sworn.
so
our
statute
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
on
supreme
court
interpretation
in
state
against
cunningham
which
was
just
prior
to
bretz,
says
just
exactly
what
i
have
said.
the
time
that
jeopardy
attaches
in
montana
is
at
the
time
the
first
witness
is
sworn,
they
are
construing
95-1711,
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
well,
if
our
statute
permits
a
retrial
on
a
termination
of
a
case
prior
to
the
swearing
of
the
first
witness,
but
after
the
jury
is
empaneled
and
sworn,
then
we
have
a
direct
conflict
with
the
federal
system.
our
montana
supreme
court
in
the
cunningham
case
held
just
exactly
that,
that
this
is
no
bar
to
a
retrial
when
the
cunningham
case
was
dismissed
after
the
jury
was
empaneled
and
sworn
and
before
the
first
witness
is
sworn.
i
have
to
use
cunningham
and
i
am
sure
you
are
familiar
with
it
the
briefs
because
it
was
a
part
of
the
consolidated
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
that
lead
to
where
we
are
now
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
i
see
your
point,
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
exactly.
you
said
do
we
have
to
argue,
that
is
our
position,
yes,
and
it
is
--
the
point
that
we
are
here
on
today
was
addressed
head
on
and
directly
in
the
cunningham
case.
when
appellee’s
petition
for
a
writ
to
the
montana
supreme
court,
that
was
summarily
denied
citing
the
cunningham
case
and
it
comes
directly
to
this
point
and
puts
us
in
a
conflict
that
we
are.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
correct,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
going
directed
and
passed
that
to
the
argument
itself.
we
agree
that
the
double
jeopardy
prohibition
in
the
fifth
amendment
affects
both
under
the
federal
system
and
the
state
system,
we
do
not
have
any
quarrel
with
that.
we
agree
that
there
is
a
point
in
time
in
which
jeopardy
does
attach
and
the
reason
that
we
are
here
is
that
we
do
not
with
the
point
in
time
that
has
been
set
forth.
so
the
question
that
we
have
for
the
court
is
this
the
point
in
time
selected
in
the
federal
system,
at
the
time
that
jury
is
empaneled
and
sworn
mandated
by
the
constitution.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
yes
sir,
after
the
petition
for
--
mr.
robert
s.
keller
i
do
not
really
think
so,
and
i
do
not
know
this.
my
opponent,
mr.
leaphart
represents
him
and
was
there
for
the
trial
and
it
may
well
be
that
it
is
not
moot.
i
never
raised
it
and
i
did
not
raise
it
because
it
is
conceivable
that
the
adamant
reversal
by
the
montana
supreme
court
may
permit
him
to
be
retried
anyhow.
they
are
the
ones
on
his
appeal
that
reverse
and
set
aside
the
conviction.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
i
not
know
that.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
i
want
to
say
this
is
the
one
entrusted
with
the
prosecution.
we
do
not
intend
to
re
prosecute
in
that
case,
but
i
do
not
know
whether
it
is
moot
or
not.
the
position
of
both
cline
and
bretz
were
identical
and
it
made
no
difference
to
me
if
cline
came
along
or
did
not
came
along.
the
issue
is
there
and
it
is
certainly
there
with
bretz,
so
i
did
not
explore
it
at
all.
it
was
raised
for
the
first
time
by
solicitor
general
in
his
brief,
in
this
court.
as
a
little
bit
of
background,
the
attorney
general’s
office
in
the
state
of
montana
is
brand
new
to
all
of
us
as
of
january
this
year
and
none
of
us
was
there
when
this
all
took
place.
both
accounts
where
the
appellees
were
there
throughout
at
all
so
they
could
probably
more
properly
answer
that.
the
first
question
that
we
have,
is
this
point
in
time
selected
in
the
federal
system
mandated
by
the
constitution?
the
ancillary
question
is
if
it
is
not,
do
we
still
have
to
follow
it
in
our
state
under
the
doctrine
of
incorporation.
historically
and
this
is
conceded
in
appellee’s
brief
that
the
common
law
jeopardy
was
not
a
problem
until
there
had
been
a
conviction
or
an
acquittal
and
at
the
time
of
the
drafting
the
constitution
this
was
a
state
of
the
common
law.
i
have
looked
frankly,
for
the
source
of
the
federal
rule
that
it
commences
at
the
time
that
the
jury
is
empaneled
and
sworn
and
the
closest
that
i
can
come
to
any
suggestions
to
you
is,
there
was
a
real
problem
for
government
appeals
up
until
the
criminal
appeals
act
of
1907.
the
language
in
the
criminal
appeals
act
was
such
that
it
permitted
a
writ
of
error
to
be
pursued
inter
alia
from
the
decision
or
a
judgment
sustaining
a
special
plea
in
bar,
when
the
defendant
has
not
been
put
in
jeopardy.
but
we
do
not
know
when
that
point
was
as
such.
the
general
rule
at
that
time
in
the
text
books,
encyclopedias
was
at
the
time
the
jury
had
been
empaneled
and
sworn,
but
the
minority
view
gave
a
distinction
of
after
conviction
of
acquittal.
there
was
a
dichotomy
that
gave
nothing
in
between.
so
the
point
that
we
are
raising
now
had
really
never
been
touched
then.
the
other
suggestion
that
i
have
is
going
far
back
to
perez
in
1824,
which
we
have
always
contemplated
as
being
the
start
of
manifest
necessity
and
if
you
read
it
and
as
you
will
recall,
and
i
am
sure
you
do
from
the
yesterday’s
argument,
this
was
a
case
with
a
hung
jury
so
all
the
evidence
that
was
in
the
case
was
all
over,
and
justice
storey
in
a
terse
opinion
is
faced
with
the
dilemma,
what
are
you
going
to
do
when
the
jury
–
you
have
got
a
jury
and
you
cannot
get
rid
of
it.
you
got
to
do
something
and
somehow,
as
you
read
that
opinion,
in
essence
it
says,
giving
rise
to
manifest
necessity
after
the
jury
is
there
and
it
cannot
arrive
at
something,
there
is
a
manifest
necessity
or
to
meet
the
end
of
justice.
from
that
i
have
to
assume
that
and
as
you
all
know
we
had
a
pretty
liberal
interpretation
for
a
long
time
of
what
is
manifest
necessity,
i
have
to
believe
that
nobody
worried
about
what
occurred
after
the
jury
was
empaneled
and
sworn
and
that
just
gradually
evolved
this
cut
off
point.
it
never
was
a
problem.
as
such
this
court
never
even
addressed
until
1963
and
that
was
in
downum,
so
we
got
a
long
period
of
time
before
the
issue
even
comes
up.
downum
was
not
only
handled
as
a
manifest
necessity
case,
the
issue
i
am
raising
was
not
raised
and
it
was
a
federal
case
to
boot.
so
nobody
questioned
when
downum
just
simply
came
out
and
said
jeopardy
attaches
when
the
jury
is
sworn
--
empaneled
and
sworn
in
a
jury
case.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
goes
to
the
states,
exactly,
and
that
is
the
first
time
it
really
came
to
a
confrontation.
somerville
against
illinois
in
1973
and
that
is
a
state
case,
but
unfortunately
for
our
position,
it
is
a
state
that
has
identical,
the
same
rule
as
the
federal
rule.
so
justice
tuttle
comments
in
his
opinion,
that
there
was
not
a
shred
of
evidence
that
this
distinction
made
a
difference
to
this
court
in
his
opinion
in
1973,
and
i
submit
i
do
not
know
of
any
reason
why
it
had
been
raised.
i
do
not
know
why
illinois
would
raise
it.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
it
was
adapted
in
1969,
as
my
recollection
of
it
judge.
it
came
out
of
the
model
penal
code
and
there
was
a
tentative
draft
in
1956,
and
a
final
draft
in
1962.
the
tentative
draft
in
1956
has
just
this
terse
comment,
they
see
no
difference
between
a
jury
and
a
non-jury
for
the
point
that
jeopardy
attaches
and
nothing
better
than
that,
but
at
least
it
explains
why
they
did
it,
but
nothing
behind
it.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
i
know
only
two
for
sure
and
i
do
not
know
the
others.
we
tried
to
research
for
that
in
point
and
ran
into
a
quagmire.
i
know
that
kentucky
has
from
the
modal
penal
code,
arizona
did
and
i
do
not
know
if
they
still
do.
new
york
did
and
they
just
now
held
their
own
statute
unconstitutional
following
the
federal
rules,
so
i
do
not
know
if
i
want
to
cite
that
as
an
authority
and
honestly
pennsylvania
had
something
comparable
to
open
up
from
the
penal
code
and
beyond
that,
no
i
do
not
know.
one
of
the
reasons
for
it
is,
in
going
through
the
state
statutes,
the
way
this
thing
is
drafted,
you
have
to
look
for
a
negative,
you
cannot
find
something
as
to
when
there
is
jeopardy
attached.
you
have
to
go
read
several
statutes
to
come
back
to
find
out
what
it
does
mean
in
that
state,
but
i
do
not
know
for
sure
that
there
are
two
others
along
with
us
today
that
have
it,
kentucky
and
arizona.
the
somerville
case
in
any
event
followed
downum
and
just
said
without
giving
a
reason
and
i
am
sure
you
noted
in
the
brief
we
have
emphasized
this
throughout,
never
has
there
been
a
reason
given
for
the
rule
that
had
been
followed
the
in
the
federal
court
and
there
was
no
as
you
pointed
out,
no
reason
to
question
until
benton,
but
the
language
in
serfass
in
1975
is
significant
to
us
and
i
do
not
want
to
be
out
of
line
of
trying
to
quote
something
that
was
said
that
is
out
of
context,
but
the
defense
has
relied
upon
serfass
because
it
followed
somerville
and
it
followed
downum.
we
rely
upon
it
because
now
for
the
first
time,
the
court
has
really
looked
at
the
point
at
which
jeopardy
attaches
and
as
you
recall
in
the
serfass,
this
was
a
point
in
time
prior
to
even
having
the
jury
empaneled
so
the
comments
are
somewhat
relevant,
but
i
do
not
want
to
take
advantage
of
them.
nevertheless,
eight
of
you
concurred
on
this
opinion
and
this
is
what
we
read
from
it.
as
an
aid
to
the
decision
of
cases
in
which
the
prohibition
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
has
been
invoked,
the
courts
have
found
it
useful
to
define
a
point
in
criminal
proceedings
at
which
the
constitutional
purposes
and
policies
are
implicated
by
a
resort
to
the
concept
of
attachment
of
jeopardy
and
goes
on
to
say
in
a
jury
case,
it
is
when
the
jury
is
empaneled
and
sworn
and
in
a
non
jury,
when
the
first
witness
is
sworn.
the
court
has
consistently
adhered
to
the
view
that
jeopardy
does
not
attach
and
the
constitutional
prohibition
can
have
no
application
until
a
defendant
is
put
to
trial
before
the
trier
of
the
facts
whether
the
trier
be
a
jury
or
a
judge.
the
constitutional
policies
underpinning
the
fifth
amendment’s
guarantee
are
not
implicated
before
that
point
in
the
proceedings
at
which
jeopardy
attaches.
as
we
have
noted
above,
the
court
has
consistently
adhered
to
the
view
that
jeopardy
does
not
attach
until
a
defendant
is
put
to
trial
before
the
trier
of
the
facts.
this
is
by
no
means
a
mere
technicality,
nor
is
it
a
rigid
mechanical
rule.
it
is
of
course
like
most
legal
rules
an
attempt
to
impart
content
to
an
abstraction
and
you
can
appreciate
why
we
like
this
language.
without
risk
of
a
determination
of
guilt,
jeopardy
does
not
attach
and
neither
on
appeal
nor
further
prosecution
constitutes
double
jeopardy
and
that
is
specifically
our
point.
we
take
the
position
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
no
jeopardy
attaches
until
a
witness
says
something
incriminating.
if
at
the
time
the
jury
was
empaneled
and
sworn,
the
prosecution
rested
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
case
would
have
to
be
dismissed.
if
at
the
time
that
the
first
witness
is
sworn,
the
prosecution
rested,
the
case
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
would
have
to
be
dismissed.
it
really
means
that
in
terms
of
when
jeopardy
attaches,
that
it
varies
with
each
case.
the
first
witness
in
a
homicide
may
be
a
pathologist.
he
does
not
have
anything
to
do
with
guilt.
he
just
wants
to
identify
the
corpus
delicti.
so
somewhere
in
there,
there
is
a
risk
of
determination
of
guilt.
our
position
is
that
our
point
in
time
is
sooner
than
jeopardy
actually
attaches
and
the
federal
system
is
even
sooner
than
our
point
in
time
and
it
is
an
aid
to
the
court
just
exactly
as
serfass
said
that
it
was,
this
is
an
aid
to
the
court
that
we
use.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
i
think
that
it
would.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
that
is
correct.
the
only
reason
i
answer
your
question
in
front
of
this
is
the
criminal
appeals
act
in
essence
permits
the
government
to
proceed
before
jeopardy
attaches.
it
does
not
have
a
cut
off
day
such
as
ours
does.
ours
is
prior
to
the
first
witness
being
sworn,
yours
is
in
the
language
before
jeopardy
attaches.
it
has
been
assumed,
i
have
to
believe
that
this
has
always
been
when
the
jury
was
empaneled
and
sworn.
if
this
court
now
adopts
our
rationale,
i
have
to
assume
that
the
government
would
be
able
to
proceed
in
a
federal
case
up
to
at
least
the
time
the
first
witness
is
sworn.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
yes,
i
understand
that
is
a
view
that
has
been
espoused.
i
do
not
support
the
view.
no.
i
believe
that
that
said
that
we
have
the
double
jeopardy
prohibition
under
the
fourteenth,
just
as
you
do
in
the
federal
system,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
that
means
we
have
to
take
the
rules
as
justice
tuttle
puts
it,
the
supervisory
rules
of
the
court
as
a
constitutional
mandate
so
we
have
to
take
the
double
jeopardy
prohibition
as
a
fundamental
guarantee
under
benton,
but
i
do
not
think
it
means
we
have
to
take
the
rules
that
went
along.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
i
am
with
you.
my
problem
in
answering
your
question
is
i
was
a
step
ahead,
my
colleague
already
posed
the
same
questions.
we
are
getting
ready
for
this
so
we
had
gone
one
step
further
and
expect
some
enterprising
government
lawyer
to
bring
one
up
if
you
go
our
way.
that
is
after
the
jury
is
empaneled
and
sworn
and
before
the
first
witness
is
sworn
and
within
our
limited
knowledge,
i
do
not
know
how
to
stop
him
so
i
just
really
was
not
answering
your
question.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
nothing.
and
i
mean,
i
was
--
i
went
to
a
matter
of
law
and
as
a
matter
of
practice
nothing
significant
happened.
as
a
matter
of
practice,
the
federal
district
judges
in
our
state
just
before
they
swear
that
jury,
now
we
hear
everything
that
has
to
be
heard
and
get
rid
of
these
motions
because
under
the
federal
system,
once
the
jury
is
sworn,
we
start.
in
the
state
level,
we
have
until
that
first
witness
is
sworn
to
get
rid
and
dispose
of
all
these
things.
as
a
matter
of
practice,
nothing
can
be
done
to
that
jury,
as
a
matter
of
law
within
those
two
periods
of
time
that
can
have
an
effect
upon
the
defendant.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
he
can
do
that,
but
what
does
that
do
in
terms
of
a
jeopardy?
statements
of
counsel
are
not
--
mr.
robert
s.
keller
i
see,
of
course.
things
can
occur.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
certainly
it
might,
but
if
you
do
not
go
further
and
that
jeopardy
did
not
attach
because
that
is
statement
of
counsel.
yes,
you
certainly
can
have
opening
statements.
in
fact,
it
is
what
made
this
particular
case
almost
ingenious.
in
using
both
the
blending
of
the
federal
and
the
state
rule,
they
were
able
to
make
their
motion
in
limine
after
the
jury
was
empaneled
and
sworn
which
in
the
federal
system,
they
would
have
had
to
make
it
before
the
jury
was
paneled
and
sworn.
they
made
it
between
the
two
periods
of
time.
the
last
thing
they
wanted
was
a
motion
to
dismiss.
that
puts
them
in
real
disadvantage,
so
when
they
make
the
motion,
that
they
made
in
the
manner
that
they
made
it,
truly
was
in
ingenious
because
they
have
got
jeopardy
attaching
under
the
federal
rule
and
they
still
can
make
their
motion
in
limine
before
they
have
commenced
under
the
state
rule.
i
really
looked
for
a
basis
for
this
and
the
only
thing
that
i
can
find
that
is,
i
really
do
not
want
to
use
the
word
weakness
in
our
position,
but
that
is
i
guess
for
lack
of
a
better
phrase,
the
weakness,
the
only
weakness
i
can
come
to
is
the
valued
right
concept
and
the
valued
right
concept
has
been
espoused.
it
has
been
espoused
by
members
of
this
court
as
recently
as
1973.
i
want
to
submit
that
the
valued
right
is
the
valued
right
to
get
the
case
tried
as
distinguished
from
the
valued
right
to
this
particular
jury.
in
fact,
if
you
take
the
position
that
it
is
a
valued
right
to
this
particular
tribunal
then
somehow
that
puts
this
court
in
a
position
of
saying
the
defendant
has
a
constitutional
right
to
a
defect
in
the
system.
the
only
way
that
you
can
have
a
jury
that
is
not
impartial
is
because
of
a
defect
in
the
selection.
the
whole
process
is
geared
to
an
impartial
jury.
now,
all
of
us
know
as
trial
lawyers,
you
can
have
a
good
or
bad
jury.
you
can
have
a
feeling
that
you
have
a
good
or
bad
jury,
but
that
is
not
quite
the
same
thing
as
the
united
states
supreme
court
espousing
that
you
have
a
constitutional
right
to
a
defect
in
the
system
to
a
good
or
bad
jury.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
now,
you
are
talking
prosecutory
manipulation,
justice
stevens
and
that
was
met
head
on
by
justice
haswell
in
the
montana
supreme
court.
if
what
you
are
talking
about
is
prosecutory
manipulation,
that
makes
no
difference
whether
the
jury
has
been
empaneled
and
sworn
or
the
first
witness
is
sworn.
if
i
as
a
prosecutor
can
manipulate
to
get
to
this
point,
i
can
ask
for
my
dismissal
before
you
swear
the
jury.
so
the
point
that
they
are
raising
does
not
really
get
to
the
difference
in
point
of
time.
this
time,
to
do
the
prosecutory
manipulation
is
just
as
valid
in
the
federal
system
as
it
is
in
the
state
system.
we
first
have
to
assume
the
prosecutor
is
manipulating,
but
the
trial
judge
has
not
caught
it
and
he
can
do
it
just
as
effectively
in
the
federal
system
as
they
are
suggesting
it
can
be
done
in
the
state
system.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
exactly
and
you
just
exhausted
it
all
and
you
know
right
then
this
does
not
look
like
a
hang
man’s
jury,
maybe
we
better
get
rid
of
it
and
try
12
more
and
that
point
in
time
is
just
as
valid
before
you
swear
that
jury
as
it
is
when
the
first
witness
is
sworn.
i
really
think
the
valued
right
concept
and
it
was
expressed
as
policies
underpinning
in
one
of
your
opinions
justice
white.
this
point
go
both
to
speedy
trial
and
double
jeopardy
and
the
right
as
such
is
the
right
to
get
the
case
tried
and
–
but
it
does
not
put
the
valued
right
to
get
the
case
tried
right
now,
quite
in
the
point
of
a
constitutional
right.
it
certainly
is
a
constitutional
right
under
speedy
trial
and
there
is
overtones
from
that
in
this
situation,
but
that
puts
us
back
to
the
question
of
what
kind
of
passage
of
time
are
we
talking
about,
as
between
just
before
the
jury
is
sworn
and
just
before
the
first
witness
is
sworn.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
yes,
sir,
intellectual
honesty
compels
me
to
answer
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
under
what
case?
mr.
robert
s.
keller
because
our
whole
thrust
is
the
montana
statute
when
we
came
into
taking
over
this
prosecution.
i
think
that
the
manifest
necessity
was
raised
for
the
first
time
by
the
federal
district
judge
batton
when
this
case
was
heard
and
i
do
not
--
in
my
mind,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
state
even
raised
it
at
the
outset.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
it
has
not,
no.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
you
mean
necessity
for
raising
to
the
montana
supreme
court?
mr.
robert
s.
keller
that
is
right.
i
do
not
no,
there
is
no
requirement
of
state.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
i
had
two
reasons
frankly
and
the
one
is
the
one
that
i
gave.
i
think
from
the
outset,
the
state
has
taken
the
position
prior
to
my
time
that
they
are
concerned
about
the
statute
in
this
point
in
time.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
then
i
lost.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
that
is
correct.
that
is
the
second
point.
i
think
that
we
are
grossly
weak
on
manifest
necessity.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
well,
i
did
not
intend
to
pursue
it.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
we
were
asked
by
the
solicitor
general
to
move
for
continuance
before
we
had
to
first
file
anything
so
that
lee
could
come
down
in
time
before
we
got
truman
before
even
we
presented
our
brief
and
at
that
time
made
a
decision
we
were
going
to
proceed
on
the
issue
that
we
felt
was
there
from
the
outset
and
not
manifest
necessity
so
our
brief
was
in
before
the
opinion
came
down
on
lee.
now,
i
summarized
a
lot
of
things,
but
we
had
a
pretty
in
depth
discussion
with
the
solicitor
general
and
the
facts
in
our
case
and
all
i
can
say
is
that
was
also
a
factor
in
deciding
not
to
--
mr.
robert
s.
keller
i
have
to
concur
with
some
of
the
points
made
by
counsel
for
bretz.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
i
do
not
think
he
has
the
right
facts
in
this
case,
justice
white
and
i
concur
with
bretz
counsel
in
that
point.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
thank
you.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
yes,
sir.
ordinarily
there
is
a
brief
statement
made
by
the
trial
judge
before
the
jury
is
even
voir
dire
to
give
them
some
concept
of
why
they
are
here
and
then
the
question
starts.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
i
do
not
know
about
that,
but
yes
the
court
could
grant
that
motion.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
well,
his
position
i
am
sure
and
knowing
the
talent
that
we
have
in
montana
would
be
that
he
was
forced
to
do
this
and
it
is
double
jeopardy
and
i
think
there
would
be
some
merit
to
that
approach
in
the
proper
situation,
but
i
am
sure
that
is
not
why
you
asked
the
question.
we
do
not
need
to
get
that
far.
yes,
if
the
conduct
of
the
prosecutor
were
outrageous,
it
would
be
the
defense
move
for
a
mistrial
or
conceivably
the
court
of
its
own
motion
grant
a
mistrial
just
for
this
reason.
it
would
not
be
too
unlike
yesterday’s
case
when
you
spell
out
the
reason.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
not
under
those
circumstances,
no
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
just
to
respond
to
some
of
the
comments;
we
did
not
extract
this
part
out
of
the
motion
in
limine.
this
motion
at
that
time
which
at
that
time
leaves
the
state
in
the
position
of
trying
to
convict
for
an
offense
that
was
repealed
a
month
before
it
is
alleged
to
have
taken
place,
is
not
an
extraction,
that
went
to
the
heart
of
everything.
they
had
to
do
something
with
those
three
counts.
a
part
of
the
confusion
that
arose
here
is
of
the
nine
counts,
three
were
subject
to
the
problem
so
the
judge
dismissed
them
sua
sponte.
the
state
dismissed
of
its
own
motion
the
remaining
six
and
i
think
this
is
mr.
leaphart’s
point
that
he
is
still
sweating
out,
then
on
the
retrial,
one
of
the
defective
counts
and
one
of
the
counts
that
state
dismissed
were
all
that
were
charged,
so
there
is
still
five
counts
sitting
out
and
i
see
what
his
point
is
and
we
do
not
intend
to
prosecute,
but
that
is
not
just
something
we
just
brought
up.
we
did
not
even
know
anything
about
this
until
it
just
came
out
in
the
solicitor
general’s
opinion
and
this
is
the
first
time
that
we
even
thought
about
it,
no
we
will
not.
the
voir
dire
questions
that
were
that
were
commented
on
as
true
in
both
systems,
federal
or
state.
if
you
are
going
to
talk
about
opening
statements,
that
is
fine.
that
can
come
up
under
the
state
system,
but
if
you
are
going
to
affect
that
jury
by
your
voir
dire
questions,
you
affect
them
under
either
system,
so
that
is
not
a
distinction
between
the
two
systems,
if
you
want
to
affect
your
jury
because
they
are
not
empaneled
and
sworn
yet.
the
valued
right
concept
may
be
a
valuable
one,
but
i
would
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
that
we
do
not
see
it
from
this
court
until
1948
in
wade
against
hunter
and
then
we
are
talking
about
a
court
marshal.
in
all
candor
with
the
court,
justice
douglas
relied
on
cornero,
a
lower
court
case
of
1931
that
refers
to
the
valued
right
and
in
further
candor,
i
found
the
valued
right
as
such
clear
back
in
united
states
against
simmons,
united
states
against
shoemaker
and
that
is
back
in
1840,
but
nobody
said
what
it
was
and
the
most
that
i
have
a
feel
of
it
was
because
that
is
the
overall
concept,
is
let
us
get
the
case
tried
now
as
distinguished
from
we
have
a
right
to
this
particular
tribunal.
the
question
of
judge
trial
in
montana
needs
to
be
tempered
a
little
bit
by
the
fact
that
montana
has
an
extremely
liberal
disqualification
feature.
so
we
can
disqualify
for
no
reason,
either
side
one
judge
in
a
criminal
case,
two
in
a
civil
case.
you
do
not
have
that
same
rule
in
federal
cases.
it
is
tough
to
get
a
federal
judge
disqualified.
does
this
mean
if
we
are
going
to
adopt
this
as
part
of
the
constitutional
baggage
that
we
know
are
going
to
have
to
be
faced
with
what
you
can
do
disqualify
a
judge
if
you
have
a
vested
right
to
this
judge
in
a
judge
trial.
i
really
do
not
mention
to
complicate
it,
but
montana
is
that
way,
going
back
to
the
wars
of
the
copper
kings,
it
is
not
hard
to
get
rid
of
a
judge
in
montana
in
either
criminal
or
civil
cases
and
i
do
not
say
that
disrespectfully.
i
was
seven
years
on
the
bench
so
i
just
know
it
is
not
hard
to
get
rid
of
them.
the
only
other
thing
i
have
to
conclude
with
the
argument
is
i
want
to
pose
this
question.
suppose
in
congress
in
1970,
in
the
criminal
appeals
act
had
instead
of
saying
until
jeopardy
attaches
had
said
when
the
first
witness
is
sworn,
would
that
have
been
unconstitutional?
would
we
be
here
today?
supposing
congress
today
enacts
legislation
that
says
in
the
federal
system,
jeopardy
does
not
attach
until
the
first
witness
is
sworn
or
enacts
the
model
penal
code,
is
that
unconstitutional
and
i
think
to
me
that
that
is
the
crutch
of
the
issue.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
you
will
recall
this
matter
was
remanded
to
be
re-briefed
and
re-argued
on
two
expanded
issues
and
the
first
issue
was
whether
or
not
the
federal
rule
that
jeopardy
attaches
in
jury
trials,
when
the
jury
is
sworn
is
constitutionally
mandated.
i
think
after
reading
the
briefs
in
this
thing
that
we
can
fairly
agree
without
arguing
that
at
the
time
of
the
constitution
it
was
not
constitutionally
mandated
and
it
was
not
a
part
of
the
constitution.
there
were
two
common
law
rules
at
that
time,
lord
coke's
rule
and
--
and
the
double
jeopardy
rule
and
when
we
get
to
as
far
as
perez.
perez
in
the
touch
tone
case
of
manifest
necessity
says,
“this
is
not
a
fifth
amendment
consideration,
this
is
not
double
jeopardy.”
perez
was
going
into
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
is
permissible
to
take
away
that
defendant’s
right
to
a
jury,
once
the
jury
is
empaneled
to
sworn,
lord
coke’s
rule
made
it
mandatory
that
you
go
to
court
for
the
verdict,
but
it
clearly
at
that
time
was
not
a
part
nor
considered
a
part
of
the
fifth
amendment.
it
does
not
become
that
until
--
and
various
jurisdictions
in
construing
the
rule
of
practice
or
the
lord
coke's
rule,
there
were
dismissals.
there
were
improper
dismissals
and
they
held
the
improper
dismissal
to
be
tantamount
to
a
jury
verdict
and
as
a
consequence
of
that,
then
it
was
jeopardy
under
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
this
did
happen,
yes.
you
do
not
see
any
changes
in
that,
until
blackstone
does
bring
out
the
words
--
maybe
there
would
be
evident
necessity,
but
it
took
a
real
necessity,
a
juror
had
to
die,
a
hung
jury
are
the
things
that
gave
them
all
their
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
s.
keller
no,
no.
ironically
in
the
common
law
states,
common
law
to
get
clue,
in
pennsylvania
and
i
am
talking
about
cases
that
were
all
decided
back
between
1800
and
1820,
they
upheld
lord
coke’s
rule
and
that
jury
had
gone
36
hours,
24
without
food
or
drink.
two
jurors,
75
years
of
age
or
older,
who
had
just
got
out
of
the
hospital
were
in
trouble
and
the
doctor
looked
at
them
and
said
if
they
have
some
food
or
drink,
something
they
can
go
on.
so,
the
judge
permitted
the
jury
to
vote
on
it
and
the
jury
said,
“no,
do
not
give
it
to
them”
and
obviously
they
had
them
hanging
on
the
ropes
and
the
judge
finally
let
them
off
the
hook
and
dismissed
the
jury
and
that
pennsylvania
supreme
court
held,
“no,
this
was
improper
and
free
the
defendants.”
they
ought
not
to
be
and
they
took
a
strict
reading
of
--
of
lord
coke’s
rule.
this
gets
commented
on,
not
only
later
by
me,
but
when
i
start
talking
about
the
arizona
against
the
washington
case
and
wonder
weather
or
not
we
even
ought
to
be
here
today
in
the
face
of
that
case,
that
opinion,
but
that
case
recites
the
reason
why
you
do
not
keep
a
jury
under
that
pressure
and
certainly
as
you
mean,
it
is
ironic.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
this
is
a
recited
fact
during
the
reign
of
the
stewarts,
mr.
chief
justice
and
lord
coke's
rule
would
have
come
down
early
in
the
1600s
and
between
that
time,
in
1688
you
would
had
reign
of
two
kings,
the
stewarts
at
that
time,
yes
there
were
re-prosecutions
until
the
prosecution
could
get
a
sufficient
case
together,
and
it
was
horribly
abused.
the
history
as
i
read
it
that
as
of
the
revolution
in
1688,
they
went
back
to
lord
coke's
rule
and
we
did
not
have
that
occurring
anymore.
the
second
part
of
your
question
is
if
there
were
an
acquittal,
would
there
be
a
re-prosecution?
short
of
the
reign
of
the
stewart
and
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
because
that
comes
out
on
a
case
so
we
know
of
no
time,
one
there
was
ever
an
acquit
of
a
re-prosecution
and
as
a
consequence
of
that
whether
it
was
by
a
rule
of
court
or
whatever
the
rule,
as
a
consequence
of
the
acquittal,
than
the
double
jeopardy
application
of
the
common
law
came
into
the
effect
and
i
cannot
answer.
i
know
of
no
case,
whether
has
been
an
acquittal
and
a
re-prosecution,
but
i
was
not
researching
from
that
standpoint
either.
when
we
researched
this
and
found
that
the
time
of
jeopardy
at
the
common
law
is
at
the
time
of
the
verdict
of
the
jury.
there
was
not
any
question
in
our
minds.
one;
nobody
today
is
going
to
go
back
that
far
in
time
and
say
that
jeopardy
does
not
attach
until
the
time
of
the
verdict,
as
it
was
at
the
common
law
and
we
felt
that
for
simple
reasons
that
we
had
too
much
law
since
then,
particularly
combining
manifest
necessity
with
double
jeopardy.
two;
fundamentally
it
was
just
unconstitutional
you
can
put
a
defendant
to
the
blade,
you
can
commit
his
defenses
and
still
not
say
that
jeopardy
attaches,
but
we
had
real
problems
in
briefing
this,
in
getting
the
vehicle
to
come
--
to
come
forward
from
the
time
of
--
of
the
judgment
up
to
where
we
want
to
be
today.
we
did
not
know
what
the
vehicle
was
and
then
came
arizona
against
washington
and
the
vehicle
is
the
“valued
right”
concept.
downum
in
1963,
justice
tuttle
in
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case
said
that
downum
necessarily
has
to
stand
for
the
proposition
that
jeopardy
attaches
at
the
time
that
the
jury
is
sworn
and
the
reason
that
downum
stands
for
that
is
because
that
case
involved
a
case
where
after
the
jury
was
sworn
and
before
the
first
witness
was
sworn,
the
case
ended.
they
did
not
have
their
witnesses
for
count
6
and
7
and
the
trial
was
terminated
and
from
that,
justice
tuttle
says,
“downum
necessarily
stands
for
this
position”
and
i
submit
that
when
you
read
arizona
against
washington
today,
you
have
to
come
out
with
the
same
conclusion.
arizona
against
washington
said,
“this
was
an
improper
opening
statement
by
a
counsel,
in
this
case
defense
counsel,
but
made
at
that
time
between
the
swearing
of
the
jury
and
before
the
first
witness.
the
fact
that
two
witnesses
testified
in
that
case
are
really
incidental
to
the
opinion.
the
rationale
is
the
“valued
right”
concept
goes
back
to
the
time
of
opening
statements
and
that
of
necessity
is
before
the
time
that
the
first
witness
is
sworn.
so
reading
this
case
as
you
read
downum,
you
have
to
say
arizona
against
washington
stands
for
this
proposition
and
that
means
that
the
only
thing
that
we
can
really
argue
today
to
this
court
is
that
we
do
not
feel
that
the
“valued
right”
concept
means
all
of
that
and
we
are
not
sure
that
what
this
court
meant,
when
it
said
that.
and
the
reason
that
i
say
that
is
that
this
court
was
particularly
careful
in
the
opinion,
not
to
say
that.
arizona
against
washington
was
argued
the
before
the
day
we
argued
the
last
time,
so
it
was
pending
during
the
time
that
our
case
was
pending.
much
of
what
was
said
in
arizona
against
washington
comes
out
of
the
briefs
that
we
submitted
in
this
case.
so,
that
we
know
that
the
court
was
conscious
of
this
case
when
the
opinion
was
written
and
yet
the
court
assiduously
did
not
say
jeopardy
attaches
at
the
time
that
the
jury
is
sworn.
so,
we
do
not
know
what
we
are
talking
about
in
terms
of
“valued
right”
as
the
vehicle
for
bringing
jeopardy
from
the
time
of
verdict,
up
to
some
starting
point
in
time.
if
you
read
the
reasons
for
the
valued
right
in
the
arizona
case,
then
you
find
that
it
is
to
avoid
emotional
and
financial
burden
a
retrial
would
cause
as
you
find
this
to
prolong
the
--
avoid
the
prolongation
of
the
period
of
stigma
and
it
may
even
enhance
risk
that
an
innocent
defendant
maybe
convicted.
that
means
if
you
read
it
literally,
you
could
even
be
going
back
to
the
time
that
you
first
select
the
panel
from
which
you
are
going
to
voir
dire.
we
do
not
know
where
the
starting
point
is
on
the
valued
right
concept.
we
do
know,
what
has
been
argued
under
the
valued
right
that
this
valued
right
is
a
right
to
a
particular
tribunal
and
that
is
expressed
as
early
as
1840
in
united
states
against
shoemaker,
it
is
lord
coke’s
rule.
you
are
entitled
to
this
panel,
this
particular
jury.
and
is
also
has
been
argued
that
the
valued
right
means
that
anything
that
goes
to
that
jury,
whether
it
is
in
the
voir
dire
questioning,
whether
it
is
in
the
opening
statement,
anything
that
does
something
to
that
tribunal
makes
that
tribunal
valuable.
serfass,
united
states
against
serfass
held
that
the
constitutional
policy
is
underpinning
the
fifth
amendment
are
not
implicated
until
jeopardy
attaches.
serfass
also
held
that
this
court
has
consistently
adhered
to
the
view
that
jeopardy
does
not
attach
until
the
defendant
is
put
to
trial
before
the
trier
of
the
facts,
jury
or
non-jury.
and
then
serfass
held,
in
two
different
places,
without
risk
of
determination
of
guilt,
jeopardy
does
not
attach.
now,
if
we
read
the
serfass
case
in
conjunction
with
arizona
against
washington,
then
we
are
saying
that
clearly
jeopardy
does
not
attach
before
the
time
the
jury
is
sworn
and
no
later
than
the
time
that
the
first
witness
is
sworn
and
we
have
at
least
narrowed
it
down
to
that
point.
if
we
go
back
to
those
points
then,
then
when
we
talk
about
the
financial
and
emotional
burden
that
was
expressed
in
the
arizona
case,
that
is
not
applicable
to
that
narrow
period
of
time.
what
difference
are
we
talking
about
in
finances
or
emotions
between
the
time
the
jury
is
sworn
and
the
time
the
first
witness
is
sworn?
the
second
reason
given
is
the
prolonging
of
the
stigma
and
that
distinction
has
gone.
surely,
we
are
not
talking
about
a
prolonging
of
a
stigma
between
the
time
the
jury
is
sworn
and
the
first
witness
is
sworn.
and,
the
last
is
enhancing
the
risk
of
conviction
of
an
innocent
man
and
that
cannot
happen
until
the
first
witness
is
sworn.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
no
sir
and
i
want
to
get
to
that
and
the
unfortunate
part
about
it
and
that
is
where
you
have
all
of
the
advantage,
i
can
only
tell
you
of
my
practice
in
montana
and
it
is
20
years
of
trial
on
both
sides
and
on
the
bench
and
it
is
uncommonly
rare
that
defense
counsel
says
anything
in
the
beginning.
i
have
never
heard
a
defense
counsel
say
anything
in
the
beginning
that
the
prosecution
did
not
already
know.
the
only
thing
that
they
say
is
something
that
they
want
that
jury
to
hear,
which
the
prosecution
already
knows
and
they
want
the
jury
to
keep
a
fair
mind
on
something.
an
open
mind
with
there
as
sort
of
facts
come
out.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
that
is
conceivable.
you
do
pick
it
up
in
the
voir
dire,
to
tell
you
the
truth
sir.
i
do.
it
is
there.
that
is
right,
but
at
least
we
have
reached
the
point
that
we
are
not
going
to
hold
constitutionally
that
somebody
is
entitled
to
anything
less
than
a
fair
jury,
so
what
you
have
done
to
the
jury
in
the
voir
dire,
is
not
something
that
is
entitled
to
protection
and
this
gets
to
the
point
that
i
was
reaching.
the
real
concept
of
a
“valued
right”
to
me
is
any
trial
lawyer
knows
that
that
when
that
defendant
goes
through
a
retrial,
let
us
say
a
hung
jury,
so
we
do
not
have
any
problem
there,
he
really
has
the
odds
against
him.
this
was
brought
out
in
the
arizona
case,
by
judge
leventhal
in
the
carsey
case
and
judge
leventhal
pegged
it.
the
second
time
through,
those
--
those
witnesses
whose
weaknesses
were
developed
by
cross
examination
by
defense
in
the
first
case,
they
start
to
shore
up
their
testimony.
it
is
not
a
--
it
is
not
a
significant
alteration,
but
it
is
there
and
i
have
yet
to
see
the
defendant
go
through
a
retrial
that
everything
did
not
change.
all
of
the
surprise
is
gone.
the
prosecution
knows
where
he
has
gone
after
the
first
dry
run.
the
prosecution
does
not
know
that
in
the
first
case.
they
have
to
be
prepared
against
anything
his
defense
counsel
will
do.
in
the
second
run,
there
is
no
spontaneity,
there
is
nothing.
that
defendant
has
an
impossible
burden
that
second
time,
he
really
does
and
this
is
the
reason
why
--
i
thought
about
this
after
the
argument
last
time.
you
know
i
argued
to
you
then
as
matter
of
law
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
defendant
is
not
in
jeopardy
until
something
comes
up
that
makes
out
a
prima-facie
case.
and
i
was
arguing
from
serfass
that
without
risk
of
determination
of
guilt,
but
i
thought
about
this
afterwards
and
i
thought,
you
know
really,
from
the
time
that
the
defense
counsel
makes
his
first
objection
or
does
not
make
his
objection
as
a
matter
of
strategy,
that
defense
is
committed.
that
is
when
they
really
going
in
and
expose
their
hand
to
the
prosecution
and
from
that
point
on,
that
defendant
does
have
a
valued
right
to
get
this
matter
heard
by
this
jury,
by
this
judge,
by
whatever
because
now,
for
the
first
time,
when
he
did
not
have
to,
he
has
tipped
his
hand
and
now
his
concern
is
interest
is
there,
is
important
or
as
was
said
in
jorn
in
defining
the
same
valued
right,
if
the
right
is
valued
it
is
because
the
defendant
has
a
significant
interest
in
the
decision
of
whether
or
not
to
take
it
from
the
jury.
and
i
submit,
until
the
time
that
the
defense
counsel
has
done
something
in
this
case,
it
tips
his
hand
to
the
prosecution,
up
until
that
point
it
is
not
the
time
of
interest
that
is
so
significant,
but
deserves
constitutional
protection,
but
from
that
point
on
it
is.
rather
than
try
and
find
out
in
any
given
case
when
that
is,
then
it
is
the
time
evidence
is
given.
you
know
is
right
after
that,
in
any
given
case.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
it
certainly
could.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
that
is
right.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
that
is
right,
problem
with
that
rationale
is
i
just
do
not
see
--
mr.
robert
s.
keller
but
if
we
are
going
to
say
that
is
what
it
takes
to
put
jeopardy,
i
expect
we
will
start
seeing
it,
but
that
the
same
defense
counsel
could
tell
the
prosecution
three
weeks
before
that
“this
is
what
i
have
up
my
sleeve”
and
i
cannot
imagine
in
trying
to
tell
him
three
weeks
before
anymore
than
i
can
see
in
a
competent
defense
counsel
tipping
to
the
prosecution.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
oh!
i
see
what
you
mean.
well,
that
is
true.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
yes,
yes
that
clearly
is.
he
could
do
it
for
the
record
three
weeks
before
if
he
wants
to,
but
as
a
practical
matter
no,
he
really
does
not
and
it
is
not
a
case
of
giving
the
prosecution
a
week
to
get
ready.
no
defense
counsel
gives
a
prosecution
five
minutes
to
get
ready
if
they
can
avoid
it.
you
do
not
tell
something
that
they
do
not
know,
until
it
is
your
turn
to
put
on
your
case
and
then
it
comes
and
i
just
simply
and
i
have
to
speak
empirically,
i
do
not
see
defense
counsel
telling
the
prosecution
anything
any
sooner
than
they
have
to.
and,
when
they
make
an
opening
statement,
they
do
not
tell
them
anything,
the
prosecution
does
not
know.
they
are
just
telling
the
jury
what
to
expect,
but
the
prosecution
knows
this.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
no,
i
did
not.
in
answer
to
that
property
then
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
is,
but
not
at
the
time
of
the
--
prior
to
the
taking
a
testimony.
the
defense
counsel
usually
reserves
his
opening
statement.
he
has
the
right
to
make
it
then
and
he
asks
--
he
says,
“i
am
going
to
reserve”
and
when
the
prosecution
has
rested
and
the
defense
is
now
ready
open
his
case,
then
he
makes
his
opening
statement,
that
is
long
after
the
witness
--
mr.
robert
s.
keller
that
is
correct.
now,
he
has
made
it
before,
but
he
has
never
--
i
have
never
heard
he
make
it
that
he
tells
the
prosecution
anything.
it
is
only
for
the
benefit
of
that
jury
going
to
this
particular
--
the
defense
knows
what
the
prosecution
is
going
to
give.
if
he
did
his
home
work
at
all,
he
knows
what
the
witnesses
have
and
he
is
telling
this
jury
at
that
time
what
to
anticipate
and
in
essence
to
keep
your
mind
open,
but
he
is
not
telling
the
jury
anything
that
the
prosecution
does
not
already
know.
it
is
that
tipping
of
the
defense
that
i
think
makes
anything
subsequent
to
that
valued,
to
that
defendant.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
well,
he
makes
his
statement
as
such
after
the
swearing
of
the
jury
and
before
the
swearing
of
the
first
witness,
but
there
is
in
various
jurisdictions,
various
judges
before
the
state,
there
is
some
opening
remark
made
at
the
time
you
first
picked
the
panel
of
24
that
you
are
going
to
cut
down
to
12,
so
that
they
at
least
know
who
the
defendant
is,
what
he
is
charged
with.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
and
the
prosecutor
who
starts
first
may
well
be
the
one.
the
judges
do
not
enter
that
actively
in
the
questions
of
the
parties
doing
this,
as
distinguished
from
the
federal
court,
where
the
judge
literally
conducts
all
of
the
voir
dire.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
yes
sir,
yes
sir
and
it
varies
with
judges.
almost
all
of
them
do
at
least
that.
some
will
go
through
preliminary
half-a-dozen
questions.
do
you
know
any
of
the
--
these
are
the
counsels
and
the
parties,
do
you
know
them
and
ask
them
and
get
those
questions
out
of
the
way
in
general
and
if
they
do,
they
hold
their
hand
up
and
they
leave
it
up
to
counsel
to
interrogate
further.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
it
is
initially
sworn
when
it
is
picked
to
tell
the
truth
as
to
the
answers
that
are
given,
but
when
--
and
that
is
the
whole
panel.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
exactly.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
sworn
again.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
that
is
right.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
it
is
three
times
they
swore
them.
the
first
swearing
is
that
they
are
going
to
tell
the
truth
as
to
the
questions
asked,
generally
as
to
whether
they
qualify
even
to
be
jurors
in
general,
then
they
go
and
they
have
another
oath
that
they
are
going
to
answer
the
questions
asked
in
this
particular
cause
by
counsel
and
as
to
their
respective
qualifications.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
no
sir,
no
sir,
never.
in
fact,
as
a
matter
of
practice
swear
everybody
in
the
court
room
the
first
time.
first
time
it
is
done
in
the
court
and
they
have
to
be
qualified.
okay
then
from
that,
you
pick
your
panel
for
that
day
and
you
usually
pick
24
for
a
trial
of
12
because
you
have
enough
peremptories
going
in
there.
you
want
to
be
--
when
you
are
all
done,
you
want
to
have
12
left.
you
have
20
in
there
to
get
by.
there,
they
stand
up
and
take
the
oath,
but
so
the
remaining
jurors
in
the
courtroom
who
may
well
be
called
into
this
case
if
somebody
is
out
for
cause
and
that
is
to
answer
the
questions
in
this
case.
but
when
you
finally
get
to
12
and
the
alternatives,
if
there
is
going
to
be
any,
those
12
or
14
stand
up
and
now
are
sworn
the
third
time.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
yes
sir.
first
two
oaths
are
that.
i
do
not
think
anybody
ever
contented.
they
have
anything
to
do
what
we
are
talking
about.
we
are
talking
about
swearing
this
final
body
of
12
to
--
mr.
robert
s.
keller
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
that
is
the
one
i
surely
construe
to
mean.
that
is
--
historically,
that
is
the
time
when
that
jury
is
sworn
--
mr.
robert
s.
keller
yes,
yes
because
of
what
is
said
to
that
jury
in
the
voir
dire
that
it
should.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
yes,
and
our
position
on
that
is
consistent
with
the
arizona
case
and
we
cited
in
our
brief
morris,
you
are
just
not
entitled
to
a
prejudiced
jury.
the
real
function
at
the
selection
at
that
time
is
to
come
out
with
12
jurors
that
are
fair-minded
and
impartial,
and
it
may
well
be
that
as
a
defense
counsel,
i
would
like
to
have
some
sleepers
on
there.
it
may
well
be
as
a
prosecutor,
i
would
like
that,
but
i
far
cry
to
say
that
it
is
entitled
to
constitutional
protection.
so
theoretically,
we
are
supposed
to
be
coming
out
with
12
impartial
people
and
we
have
no
particular
interest
in
that
tribunal
other
than
the
fact
that
they
be
impartial
jurors.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
settled
law
did
not
become
settled
law
--
mr.
robert
s.
keller
--
until
1963,
well
over
a
century
and
a
half,
almost
two
centuries
after
we
started.
wade
against
hunter
first
annunciated
the
value
of
right
concept
a
century
and
a
half
after
we
started
and
i
might
add
in
a
non-jury
case,
and
now
it
is
settled,
but
it
really
did
not
become
this
till
1969
because
it
was
not
settled
in
montana.
it
was
not
settled
in
any
of
the
states
until
benton
against
maryland
in
1969.
it
is
settled
in
the
minds
of
the
federal
judiciary
because
it
has
been
around
for
a
long
time,
but
it
has
not
been
with
the
others.
as
far
back
or
as
recently
as
1935,
the
ali
is
recommending
that
jeopardy
not
attach
until
verdict
of
the
jury,
where
it
was
in
the
beginning.
so
(voice
overlap)
it
is
not
settled
and
our
question
is,
have
we
afforded
protection
for
this
defendant
under
any
guise
by
saying
it
attaches
at
the
same
time
as
it
does
in
a
non-jury
case.
excuse
me,
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
no.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
civil
or
criminal?
mr.
robert
s.
keller
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
yes,
that
is
why
i
agree
with
the
rule
of
attachment
which
is
the
swearing
of
the
first
witness
because
i
think
when
that
first
witness,
the
prosecution
starts
to
testify,
the
defense
counsel
commits
himself
by
objecting
even
before
cross-examination,
by
objecting
to
a
question
or
for
strategy
reasons,
not
objecting
to
testimony.
at
that
point
he
has
in
this
thing
and
that
is
why
i
do
not
have
any
objection
and
i
do
not
mean
it
really
because
of
montana
statute
either.
sure,
i
want
to
see,
i
think
we
have
afforded
protection,
but
just
in
terms
of
trying
to
figure
out
where
this
ought
to
be
and
be
something
that
is
going
to
protect
the
defendant’s
right
across
the
board
and
not
just
in
a
given
state,
i
can
see
it
attaching
that
soon
because
at
that
point
the
defense
counsel
is
starting
to
put
something
into
this
case,
but
he
does
not
want
to
have
to.
he
has
tipped
his
hand.
if
he
goes
a
second
time,
it
is
not
going
to
be
that
way
and
i
know
it
is
not
going
to
be
that
way.
judge
leventhal
pegged
it
and
i
think
any
of
us
who
have
tried
cases
know
that
judge
leventhal
has
pegged
it,
that
second
run
is
for
a
--
mr.
robert
s.
keller
real
easy.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
no,
he
really
does
not.
yeah,
i
know.
i
know
that
--
that
he
has
certainly
got
to
do
his
work,
but
he
has
got
to
his
work
when
his
client
came
in
the
office
and
you
can
go
back
to
the
time
that
the
information
is
filed
and
you
see
efforts
on
that
time
to
--
to
question
whether
or
not
the
affidavit
for
leave
to
file
is
correct
or
you
question
whether
or
not,
before
i
adjust
the
piece,
probable
cause
was
shown
and
cause
a
transcript
to
be
made
and
you
have
argued
that
and
that
is
all
part
of
the
tools
of
the
trade,
but
the
real
question
is,
has
he
committed
himself
then?
no,
he
really
has
not
because
if
he
does
not
do
it
then,
he
is
not
going
to
be
able
to
do
it.
so
that
is
just
part
of
the
process.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
of
course
he
could.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
because
i
do
not
think
his
right
is
that
valued
until
that
point.
lord
coke’s
rule,
if
you
have
read
into
biographies
on
lord
coke,
he
never
gave
any
reasons
for
his
rules.
if
they
took
out
all
the
rules
that
he
gave
with
no
reason,
they
would
lose
75%
of
the
english
law,
but
his
rules
have
been
good
so
how
do
we
find
out
what
the
reason
is
that
gave
us
valued
right
and
that
is
where
we
came
into
this
case.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
because
once
he
has
tipped
his
hand
to
the
prosecution
on
something
that
the
prosecution
does
not
know
where
he
is
going
to
go,
then
if
he
gets
a
retrial
on
that
point,
there
is
nothing
left
for
the
defense
to
have.
it
is
just
that
--
it
has
already
been
run.
there
is
no
spontaneity.
the
second
trial,
and
i
use
this
as
an
example
where
there
is
a
hung
jury,
so
it
is
a
clear
rerun
of
the
whole
show
and
that
defendant’s
chances
at
that
time,
justice
rehnquist
are
just
simply
zilch.
there
is
no
secret.
the
prosecution
knows
where
the
defense
counsel
is
going.
those
witnesses
that
were
there
to
testify
that
the
defense
counsel
shredded
on
cross-examination
and
now
get
the
shading
that
is
indicated
by
judge
leventhal
in
the
carsey
case
and
it
is
just
a
different
trial,
and
the
defendant’s
chances
are
seriously
enhanced,
apart
--
mr.
robert
s.
keller
yes,
i
know
that
because
there
is
no
reasonable
alternative.
the
alternative
as
pointed
out
in
the
arizona
case
and
prior
to
that,
is
you
are
going
to
put
some
sort
of
influence
in
those
juries
to
come
out
with
a
--
with
some
verdict
rather
than
a
mistrial
and
that
is
not
fair.
but
just
because
we
do
not
like
that
aspect
of
it,
i
read
this
in
the
valued
right
definition
or
reasons,
given
the
arizona
case,
this
possibility
that
you
may
convict
an
innocent
man,
that
is
where
it
comes.
it
is
that
chance
that
he
is
going
to
tip
his
defense
and
that
it
runs
again
and
that
may
well
be
an
innocent
man.
i
do
not
see
anything
significant
about
the
defendant’s
right
or
anything
else
until
that
point
when
he
has
tipped
his
hand.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
it
can
occur
until
that
time,
unless
he
wants
to
voluntarily
go
out
and
do
something
to
tip
his
hand,
which
would
include
making
an
opening
statement
of
what
he
is
tipping.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
i
do
not
know,
either.[laughter]
i
want
to
said
that
you
could
read
this
later
the
same
way
downum
is
being
read
to
say,
well,
if
this
happens
when
the
prosecutor
made
his
opening
statement,
that
is
before
my
point
in
time
and
we
are
in
trouble,
but
on
the
other
hand,
this
court
had
to
know
this
case
was
pending
and
this
court
did
not
say,
as
it
had
said
in
the
past,
jeopardy
attaches
when
the
jury
is
sworn
and
when
you
assiduously
did
you
not
say
that,
i
have
to
believe
that
you
are
leaving
open
this
very
question
we
are
here
today
on
and
i
think
that
hinges
on
what
is
the
valued
right
and
--
and
when
should
it
have
constitutional
protection.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
and
the
government
has
in
amicus
curiae
in
this
case?
mr.
robert
s.
keller
i
do
not
think
i
saved
much
time,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
the
wade
against
hunter,
justice
murphy
with
justice
douglas
and
justice
rutledge
agreeing
in
dissent
said
in
the
first
paragraph,
“we
agree
with
the
court
below
that
in
the
military
courts
as
in
civil,
jeopardy
within
the
meaning
of
the
fifth
amendment
attaches
when
the
court
begins
the
hearing
of
evidence”
on
any
thing,
question
that
court
marshal
that
you
were
not
talking
about
a
jury
or
picking
a
jury,
that
was
prior
to
1951
and
you
just
know
they
did
not
have
jury
right.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
the
only
other
points
are
just
in
passing,
any
opening
statement
that
my
colleague,
mr.
moses
makes
to
a
jury
does
not
tell
the
prosecution
anything.
i
know
that
he
does
not
and
he
might
have
a
battered
woman
syndrome,
he
might
have
anything
else,
but
he
does
not
tell
the
prosecution
anything
not
uncommonly,
not
until
on
appeal,
but
frankly
so,
yeah
there
is
no
problem
there
and
we
do
not
have
that
back
--
mr.
robert
s.
keller
at
that
particular
time?
mr.
robert
s.
keller
i
did
not
think
that
there
was
a
manifest
necessity
question.
i
can
recall
that
justice
rehnquist
asking
me,
maybe
you
might
and
i
would
disagree
on
this,
well-taken,
but
at
that
particular
time
and
we
did
not
participate
in
the
trial
of
this,
at
that
particular
time,
we
had
three
counts
that
were
defective
just
because
of
a
typographical
error.
what
mr.
moses
is
talking
about
is
he
thought
all
nine
were
defective,
aside
from
the
typographical
error
just
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
that
is
correct,
but
as
to
these
three
counts
that
had
to
get
thrown
out,
they
charged
an
offense
that
was
not
an
offense
any
longer.
the
--
the
law
had
changed
in
montana,
criminal
code
of
1973
took
effect
on
january
01,
1974
and
these
three
counts
said
the
crimes
in
1973,
language
occurred
in
january
and
february
1974.
well,
they
could
go
to
trial.
they
could
go
anywhere
and
they
could
never
convict
on
that,
but
you
did
make
a
good
point
and
judge
bennett
will
never
make
a
mistake
again.
he
will
grant
the
amendment,
have
the
trial
and
get
reversed,
and
we
will
try
it
again.
we
will
not
talk
double
jeopardy
and
you
know
that
is
terrible.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
i
do
not
think
that
he
did
have
that
power.
i
think
that
change
was
substantive
and
our
statute
at
that
time
prevented
the
substantive
change.
you
are
going
to
charge
the
defendant
with
picking
up
an
extra
year
of
time
to
defend
on
its
face,
not
really,
but
you
were
on
its
face,
it
was
there.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
to
dismiss
those
charges,
yes,
i
think
there
was
on
those
three,
but
not
on
the
remaining
six.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
that
is
where
the
hang
up
came
and
he
got
convicted
oddmently
(ph)
of
one
of
the
three
that
was
corrected.
he
got
charged
at
the
second
trial
with
one
of
the
six
that
was
not
effected
and
one
of
the
three
that
was
corrected
and
found
guilty
of
one
of
the
three
that
was
corrected.
prosecution
at
that
time
did
not
want
to
go
ahead
on
those
six
because
they
were
not
that
good,
but
they
would
have
sure
come
under
ash
v.
swenson.
it
would
have
been
clerical
staff
of
court
as
a
alleged
because
it
all
took
the
same
period
of
time.
they
all
have
to
do
with
one
woman
and
one
transaction
literally.
they
were
spreadeagled
at
the
time
whether
they
knew
it
or
not,
and
it
may
have
not
been
a
tactical
stroke,
but
sure
it
was
an
awfully
smart
move.
mr.
robert
s.
keller
thank
you,
your
honor.
