justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
keller,
your
statute
does
not
say
there
can
be
a
trial
up
till
the
time
the
witness
is
worn.
it
says
there
shall
not
be
a
trial
after
the
witness
is
sworn?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
statute
literally,
it
does
not
do
that
it
is
not
unconstitutional,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
it
is
then
the
statute
that
permits
it.
well,
i
still
have
some
difficulty.
i
can
understand
that
is
the
rule
in
montana,
but
i
am
not
quite
sure
that
there
is
a
statute
that
is
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
i
am
trying
to
suggest
is
that
perhaps
the
legislature
could
have
repealed
the
statute,
so
you
did
not
have
a
statute
on
the
books
and
the
montana
supreme
court
might
nevertheless
had
made
precisely
the
same
holding,
then
there
would
not
be
any
–
just
say
it
is
a
matter
of
montana
law,
jeopardy
does
not
attach
till
the
witness
is
sworn.
i
do
not
think
you
would
have
an
unconstitutional
statute
then.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
a
fair
statement
of
their
argument,
could
you
not
have
phrased
it
just
the
other
way
that
the
defendant
might
be
convinced
that
he
has
a
good
and
impartial
fair
jury,
but
the
prosecutor
wants
to
have
12
more
preemptory
channels
so
he
dismisses
the
prosecutor's,
let
us
try
and
get
a
better
jury
from
the
prosecutor’s
standpoint?
justice
john
paul
stevens
immediately
before
the
jury
is
sworn
and
you
know
who
the
jurors
will
be?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
this
case,
in
the
opening
statement
had
not
been
there,
had
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
by
the
counsel
for
defendant,
made
immediately
after
the
swearing
of
the
jury,
as
i
understand
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
moses
from
that
point
of
the
preemptory
challenge
to
the
entire
panel
which
concerned
me
before,
under
montana
law
does
the
prosecutor
have
a
right
to
have
the
prosecution
dismissed
after
the
jury
is
sworn,
but
before
the
first
witness
is
sworn
or
is
it
subject
to
permission
by
the
trial
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
his
argument,
and
i
did
mention
your
response
to
that,
his
argument
is
that
if
you
have
a
prosecutor
who
seeks
to
manipulate
by
dismissing
the
panel,
he
can
do
it
equally
before
the
swearing
and
then
equally
as
well
before
the
jury
is
sworn
as
immediately
thereafter.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
suppose
the
countervailing
consideration,
i
am
just
trying
to
think
it
through
is
that
before
you
really
start
questioning
witnesses
and
the
like,
you
do
need
a
point
in
the
procedure,
proceedings
where
there
is
kind
of
a
cleanup
of
all
outstanding
motions
and
odds
and
ends
before,
whereas
which
might
have
involve
a
dismissal
or
retrial
or
change
in
the
date
of
indictment
or
something
like
that
and
is
not
there
some
sense
to
saying
that
an
orderly
procedure
would
have
that
come
right
before
you
put
the
witness
on
or
before
you
make
your
opening
statements
rather
than
right
in
the
midst
of
the
jury
selection
processes
and
before
the
jury.
just
in
terms
of
an
orderly
way
to
get
the
trial
going
is
not
there
something
that
favor
his
argument
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
not
true
that
in
this
case
they
waited
until
after
the
jury
was
sworn
before
they
presented
some
motion
which
the
judge
regarded
as
timely?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
keller,
you
have
indicated
that
it
would
make
sense
to
have
the
point
to
which
jeopardy
attaches
be
one
that
the
defendant
has
committed
himself
or
want
to
make
a
difference.
are
there
reasons
for
moving
the
point
at
which
jeopardy
attaches
back
from
--
from
the
present
rule
that
it
attaches
when
the
jury
is
sworn
back
to
back,
significant
enough
to
overcome
the
interest
in
having
settled
law
remain
clear
and
definite
and
certain.
there
are
some
advantages
there,
but
everybody
now
knows
what
the
rule
is.
do
you
think
it
is
the
change?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
they
are
settled
today
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
keller,
can
i
ask
you
one
more
question?
you
said
at
the
outset
that,
of
course
you
did
not
have
the
benefit
of
arizona
against
washington
when
you
filed
your
briefs
and
that
had
--
if
you
had,
that
kind
of
decides
the
whole
case,
but
do
you
think
arizona
against
washington
helps
you
or
hurts
you?
i
am
not
quite
sure
i
understand
your
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
government
does
not
contend
that
that
is
the
present
state
of
the
double
jeopardy
constitutional
law
in
this
country,
does
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
government
does
agree
that
this
valued
right,
whatever
it
is,
is
protected
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
logic
of
that
argument
really
escapes
me.
supposing
before
trial
started,
the
police
conducted
an
illegal
search
of
some
kind
and
the
evidence
was
not
introduced
until
just
before
the
jury
retired
for
the
verdict.
would
you
say,
well,
the
jeopardy
had
not
attached
because
the
search
occurred
before?
i
mean,
you
do
not
look
at
the
time
of
the
--
the
time
when
jeopardy
attaches
does
not
depend
on
when
the
error
was
committed,
does
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
just
do
not
understand
the
logic
because
it
actually
dismissed
the
case
after
two
witnesses
had
testified.
so
if
jeopardy
attaches
when
a
witness
testifies,
then
jeopardy
is
attached
when
he
made
his
ruling?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
incidental
to
the
question
when
the
jeopardy
is
attached?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
true.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
supposing
this
--
this
prejudicial
argument
had
been
made
during
the
voir
dire,
which
could
have
happened,
he
could
have
made
some
prejudicial
remark,
would
you
say
jeopardy
therefore
had
to
attach
during
voir
dire?
justice
john
paul
stevens
really
i
think
what
you
are
saying
is
that
the
trial
judge
who
had
to
make
the
ruling
was
considering
the
fact
that
jeopardy
had
attached
at
the
time
of
opening
statements,
but
that
was
either
as
a
matter
of
arizona
law
or
perhaps
even
his
understanding
of
the
constitution,
but
that
really
does
not
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
moses
just
to
follow
up
on
justice
powell’s
question.
in
your
judgment,
if
the
case
had
gone
to
trial
on
the
original
counts
and
there
had
been
a
verdict
of
guilty,
would
there
have
been
reversible
error
in
the
record
and
--?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
what
would
have
happened?
then
if
that
--
if
that
had
happened,
then
there
would
have
been
a
reversal
and
a
new
trial,
is
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
would
have
--
your
client
would
have
had
to
stand
trial
twice
if
you
are
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
then
how
was
your
client
in
terms
of
double
jeopardy
policy
and
valued
right
and
all
the
rest
that
we
have
been
talking
about,
how
was
your
client
hurt
at
all
by
having
the
dismissal
take
place
right
at
the
outset
of
the
proceeding,
instead
of
going
through
a
whole
trial
on
appeal
and
ending
up
in
the
same
place?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
did
not
have
a
good
enough
jury
to
insist
on
your
right.
did
you
try
to
go
--
did
you
want
to
go
to
trial
on
that,
i
am
trying
to
remember
now?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
did,
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
you
moved
to
dismiss
the
--?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
keller,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
please?
just
on
the
point
that
justice
powell
and
i
were
inquiring
of
your
adversary,
what
is
the
state’s
position
on
whether
or
not
there
was
a
manifest
necessity,
just
so
we
have
it
clear
on
the
record?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
keller
i
just
--
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
understand.
is
it
clear
then
in
the
state’s
view
that
the
trial
judge
had
power
to
amend
the
counts
and
there
was
no
necessity
for
dismissal,
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
the
same
question
again.
in
your
view,
was
there
or
was
there
not
manifest
necessity
for
dismissal
of
the
charges?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
so
the
remaining
--
