justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
court
after
that
i
think
you
left
out
one
point,
the
court
not
only
reversed,
but
also
dismissed
the
charges?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
a
little
different
from
just
a
reversal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
can
the
state
do
after
that,
under
this
non
kind
of
state
law?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
can
montana
do
as
to
these
charges
against
this
man
after
the
supreme
court
of
montana
dismisses
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
still
have
not
told
me
how
they
can?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
i
thought
you
said
the
charges
were
dismissed
by
the
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
can
they
be
retried?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
where
are
these
counts
that
they
can
retry?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
that
all
--
it
is
all
there
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
they
could
try
and
file
without
filing
at
all.
under
montana
law
charges
that
are
dismissed
by
a
court
can
be
retried?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
is
a
standard
trial
twice
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
is
no
threat
of
that
at
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
addition
we
have
the
statement
from
the
attorney
general
that
he
will
not
do
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
where
is
the
threat
that
the
next
attorney
general
might
do
it
or
his
grandson
might
do
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
do
not
think
that
both
of
you
by
agreeing
with
again
was
jurisdiction,
if
it
is
not
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
as
of
now
he
is
not
in
custody,
he
is
not
subject
to
trial
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
want
the
jury
to
focus
on
one
point?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
could
be
if
against
the
usual
policy,
defense
counsel
makes
his
argument
to
the
jury?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
could,
then
he
is
committed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
probably
a
committal
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
do
not
do
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
think
the
difference
is
that
one
is
in
the
presence
of
the
court
and
he
is
stuck
with
it
as
if
he
just
tells
the
prosecutor
he
is
not
stick
with
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
not
that
be?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
only
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
keller,
exactly
when
you
were
a
judge,
i
think
most
of
them
the
jury,
could
not
the
defense
counsel
commit
himself
on
cross
examination?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
real
easy,
talking
about
real
easy?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
he
commits
himself,
well,
i
made
a
mistake,
judge,
i
move
to
suppress
the
(inaudible)
trial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
if
he
changes
his
own
strategy
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
will
not
use
the
word
that
usually
you
--
the
judge
says
or
the
jury
says,
if
i
created
the
prosecution,
is
it
satisfactory
to
the
defense?
usually,
and
they
are
right?
once
you
have
--
jury
that
is
satisfactory
to
the
defendant
instead
of
--
in
favor
of
the
defendant,
this
applies
onwards?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
i
mean,
the
point
is
that
they
always
ask
that
question,
do
they
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
do
not
believe
that
in
every
case
the
judge
turns
and
says
this
jury
is
satisfactory,
can
they
use
those
exact
words?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
then,
have
you
ever
seen
a
trial
where
the
judge
did
not
say
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
about
the
several
other
cases
where
a
defense
counsel
does
not
make
an
opening
statement?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
no
one
have
--
no
one
has
ever
done
it.[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
it
is
not
healthy.[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
in
the
world
can
a
man
be
convicted
if
no
evidence
is
present
against
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
how
is
he
in
jeopardy?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
know
we
discussed
that
the
last
time,
but
the
--
nobody
has
raised
that
point
this
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
we
are
talking
about
a
possibility
of
two
or
three
minutes
too?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
it
also
could
be
a
case
that
is
tried
early
on
a
monday
morning?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
both
sides
waive
on
new
statement?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
would
not
be
much
good,
would
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
one
minute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
talking
about
an
average
trial.
the
difference
--
you
say
it
has
to
be
one
witness
sworn?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean,
that
is
the
governmentâ€™s
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
right.
if
one
witness
is
sworn?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
say
no,
once
the
jury
empaneled?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
could
be
just
a
few
minutes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
it
could
be?
