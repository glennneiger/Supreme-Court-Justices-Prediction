chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
76-1200,
crist
against
cline
and
bretz.
mr.
keller,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
suggest
happens
significantly
between
the
empaneling
of
the
jury
and
the
swearing
of
the
first
witness?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
the
opening
statement
to
the
prosecution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
my
question
to
your
point
is
that
nothing
happens?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
between
opening
statement
--
that
an
opening
statement
may
have
an
impact?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
leaphart?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
i
suppose
you
do
not
know
yet
is
not
that
your
point?
you
do
not
know
that
he
may
be
charged
again?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
what
is
the
concern?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
in
any
event
that
basic
issue
will
be
presented
by
the
other
case
or
resolution
that
support
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
apart
from
your
client's
interest
the
basic
issue
will
be
decided
in
the
other
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
of
course
there
is
still
the
factor
of
the
sound
judicial
discretion
of
the
trial
judge
as
to
whether
to
grant
that
protection?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
saying
that
there
is
some
really
imperative
need,
i
am
not
sure
what
manifest
necessity
means,
but
that
there
is
some
significant
element
of
the
administration
of
justice
that
requires
the
federal
and
the
state
time
frame
to
be
the
same?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
am
not
arguing
or
suggesting
or
intimating
that
one
or
the
other
is
better.
i
am
simply
saying
is
there
any
need
that
the
federal
rule
bind
all
the
50
states
as
to
this
time
factor?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
was
a
federal
case,
was
it
not,
jorn?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
go
ahead
and
respond,
we
will
extend
your
time
two
minutes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
damaging
statements
made
during
the
jury
selection
process
unless
you
have
a
trial
judge
who
is
going
to
protect
the
case
are
beyond
the
reach
of
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
moses?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
moses.
mr.
keller
before
you
begin.
let
me
put
this
question
for
you,
relating
to
some
questions
i
put
earlier.
after
the
swearing
of
the
jury,
in
montana
and
i
take
it
the
prosecutor
is
permitted
to
make
the
first
opening
statement,
if
he
elects
to
do
so,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
addressing
myself
now
to
the
possible
damage
or
injury
to
the
defendant
that
can
occur
from
the
opening
statement.
if
an
opening
statement
is
let
us
assume
one
that
is
outrageously
bad
and
misrepresentation
by
the
prosecutor.
of
course
the
prosecutor
is
not
going
to
move
for
a
mistrial
on
that
ground,
but
the
defense
might
do
so
and
i
suppose
under
montana
procedure
and
practice,
if
the
opening
statements
have
been
excessively
bad,
the
court
could
grant
that
motion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
there
would
be
no
double
jeopardy
problem?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
(voice
overlap)
that
motion
at
the
request
of
the
defendant,
the
defendant
would
be
in
rather
a
difficult
position
to
raise
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
presumably
if
the
court
granted
a
mistrial
of
its
own
motion,
a
double
jeopardy
question
could
well
be
preserved.
it
would
be
much
less
likely
if
the
defendant
moved
for
it
and
of
course
we
could
assume
that
the
prosecution
is
not
going
to
move
for
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
unless
a
senior
officer
happened
to
walk
in
the
courtroom
and
wanted
to
avoid
the
problem,
well,
go
ahead.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
you
have
all
been
most
helpful.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
crist
against
cline.
mr.
keller,
you
may
proceed,
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
there
an
earlier
time
when
even
after
an
acquittal,
prosecutions
were
brought
again
and
again
until
--?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
montana,
is
it
customary
for
both
the
counsels
to
make
their
opening
statements
before
the
first
witness
is
called?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
this
first
oath
is
essentially
like
the
oaths
given
to
witnesses,
merely
to
tell
the
truth?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
say
that
never
occurs
until
the
first
witness
is
called?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
he
can
always
save
that
opening
statement
in
both
federal
and
in
montana
courts
until
he
is
ready
to
open?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
keller.
mr.
geller?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
does
the
jury
--
does
the
constitution
guarantee
the
man
a
favorable
jury
or
an
unfair
jury?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you
give
that
much
weight
to
that
mr.
geller,
how
do
you
reconcile
that
with
what
justice
black
said
in
wade
against
hunter?
what
has
been
said
is
enough
to
show
that
the
“defendant’s
valued
right”
to
have
his
trial
completed
by
a
particular
tribunal
must
in
some
instances
be
subordinated
to
the
public
interest
in
fair
trials
designed
to
end
in
just
judgments.
if
it
is
totally
constitutional,
justice
black’s
statement
is
inconsistent,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
leaphart?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
wade
--
wade
against
hunter
was
a
jury
case
or
a
jury
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
there
is
--
there
is
no
real
analogy
between
the
composition
of
a
court
marshal
and
the
composition
of
a
jury
of
a
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
theoretically?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
moses?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
ask
you
just
one
question?
when
you
spoke
of
the
judge
giving
instructions,
you
are
speaking
of
preliminary
limited
instructions
about
the
burden
of
proof
in
the
order
of
trial,
not
a
--
not
a
complete
instruction
on
the
law
of
the
particular
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
keller?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
three
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
keller.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
crist
against
bretz
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
stewart.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
stewart.
