justice

mr.
keller,
we
postponed
the
question
of
whether
or
not
we
have
a
appellate
jurisdiction
over
this
case
until
the
argument
in
the
matter
rather
than
noting
probable
jurisdiction.
justice
potter
stewart
i
gather
that
your
opponent,
the
appellee
does
now
concedes
that
there
is
an
appellate
jurisdiction,
a
new
kind
of
thing
so
you
do
not
discuss
it
in
your
brief.(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
because
the
court
of
appeals
has
held
invalid
the
statute
at
the
state
of
montana?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
is
a
sufficiently
clear
holding
that
your
statute
is
unconstitutional?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
is
the
meaning
of
your
statute
as
authoritatively
construed
by
the
highest
court
of
your
state?
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
it
was
not
until
1969
that
this
question
could
have
possibly
risen,
it
was
not
until
then
in
the
benton
case
where
the
double
jeopardy
protection
after
the
(voice
overlap)
goes
to
the
states.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
keller,
you
said
you
made
an
effort
to
find
the
origin
and
history
of
the
federal
rule
of
point
being
when
the
jury
is
empaneled
and
sworn,
what
is
the
history
of
your
statute
in
your
state,
do
you
know?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
know
what
other
states
or
how
many
other
states
if
any?
justice
potter
stewart
therefore,
it
is
conceivable
at
least
is
it
not
in
line
with
my
brother
rehnquist's
question
that
the
court
might
hold
that
the
constitution
tolerates
the
montana
rule
without
at
the
same
time
holding
that
it
requires
the
federal
rule
to
be
the
same.
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
the
court
has
held
that
the
guarantee
of
a
jury
trial
under
the
federal
constitution
guarantees
a
12
member
jury
in
federal
cases,
but
tolerates
a
smaller
jury
in
state
cases,
state
criminal
cases?
justice
potter
stewart
dismissed
by
the
prosecutor?
justice
potter
stewart
and
has
the
statute
of
limitations
run
by
now?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
clear
is,
it
not,
that
in
the
federal
system,
in
a
non
jury
trial
jeopardy
attaches
--
does
not
attach
until
after
the
first
witness
is
sworn?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
clear?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
really
not
necessarily
so
in
many
cases?
justice
potter
stewart
without
question.
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
original
concept
of
the
common
law,
there
could
be
no
such
thing
as
a
failure
of
a
jury
to
reach
a
verdict,
is
not
that
correct?
they
lock
them
up
on
bread
and
water
and
they
would
come
back
with
a
verdict
on
whenever
they
ready?
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
no
such
thing
as
a
hung
jury
in
the
concept
of
jury
common
law?
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understood
you
earlier,
you
told
us
that
in
your
state
of
montana,
it
is
not
the
practice
to
have
opening
statements.
justice
potter
stewart
after
the
prosecution
witnesses
have
all
testified,
the
prosecution
has
rested,
then
the
defense
counsel
makes
his
open
statement
to
the
jury?
justice
potter
stewart
when
if
at
all
mr.
keller
does
the
prosecutor
make
his
opening
statement
in
your
practice,
in
montana?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
is
part
of
voir
dire,
is
it
not?
so
you
can
ask
him,
“do
you
know
the
defendant
--”
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
the
whole
venire?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
is
to
(voice
overlap)?
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understood,
your
point
is
that
the
--
this
--
this
point
of
the
law
that
something
happens
when
the
jury
is
empaneled
and
sworn.
it
was
not
ever
really
part
of
the
double-jeopardy
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
was
at
all.
it
was
part
of
a
quite
a
different
rule
that
a
person
is
entitled
once
the
jury
is
empaneled
and
sworn
to
go
to
trial
with
that
jury
and
to
go
to
a
final
conclusion
of
the
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
civil
or
criminal
and
that
is
a
different
--
it
has
a
different
origin
from
the
--
from
--
and
is
unrelated
to
the
double-jeopardy?
justice
potter
stewart
or
say,
historically?
the
double
jeopardy
clause
was
applicable
to
somebody
who
had
been
tried
and
convicted
or
tried
and
acquitted,
he
could
not
be
tried
again,
and
this
business
of
the
interest
in
going
to
trial
before
the
same
jury
and
so
on
was
then
grafted
on
to
it
and
had
quite
a
different
history,
did
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
if
one
looks
at
the
perez
opinion,
as
i
just
have
and
realize
for
the
first
time
there
is
no
mention
at
all
in
that
opinion
of
the
constitution
itself,
let
alone
the
double
jeopardy
clause?
justice
potter
stewart
precisely,
and
therefore
one
can
--
one
can
infer
that
from
that
opinion,
that
he
is
saying
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
inapplicable
we
are
--
we
are
--
justice
potter
stewart
we
are
concerned
here
with
something
else?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
only
recently
is
that
i
thought
had
been
grafted
on
to
the
double
jeopardy
guarantee?
justice
potter
stewart
right,
and
as
part
of
the
double
jeopardy
interest?
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
have
been
--
before
that,
historically
it
had
been
a
different
interest,
may
perhaps
protected
by
the
due
process
clause?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
common
law,
as
a
condition
precedent
for
the
--
for
any
inquiry
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
there
would
have
to
have
been
an
acquittal
or
a
conviction?
justice
potter
stewart
single
jeopardy
--
jeopardy?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
goes
back
to
jorn
which
in
turn
goes
back
to
hunter,
i
guess?
justice
potter
stewart
it
does
not
mean
that
is
sound
necessarily.
it
does
not
mean
that
the
two
concepts
do
not
have
different
historic
origins?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
what
do
you
mean
by
that;
eliminate
search
and
seizure?
justice
potter
stewart
you
said,
“eliminate
search
seizure?”
justice
potter
stewart
so,
there
would
be
no
searches
and
no
seizures
in
montana?
justice
potter
stewart
no
exclusionary
rules?
justice
potter
stewart
because
they
did
not
charge
criminal
offenses
under
montana
law?
justice
potter
stewart
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
it
involves
another
aspect
of
the
constitutional
guarantee
against
being
twice
put
in
jeopardy.
precise
issue
is
relatively
simple
one
and
it's
a
single
one
and
it
is
whether
the
federal
rule,
governing
the
time
when
jeopardy
attaches
in
a
jury
trial
is
binding
on
montana
through
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
federal
rule
is
that
jeopardy
attaches
when
the
jury
is
impaneled
and
sworn.
a
montana
statue
provides
that
jeopardy
does
not
attach
until
the
first
witness
is
sworn.
for
the
reasons
stated
in
some
detail
in
the
written
opinion
of
the
court
filed
today,
we
hold
that
the
federal
rule,
that
jeopardy
attaches
when
the
jury
is
impaneled
and
sworn
is
an
integral
part
of
the
constitutional
guarantee
against
double
jeopardy.
and
that
accordingly
it
is
binding
upon
the
individual
states.
for
these
reasons
the
judgment
before
us
is
affirmed.
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
justice
powell
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
have
joined.
