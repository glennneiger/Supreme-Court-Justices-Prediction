mr.
w.
william
leaphart
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
of
mootness
has
been
raised
so
i
will
direct
myself
to
that
initially.
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief
in
a
footnote
on
page
5
has
noted
the
fact
that
mr.
cline’s
conviction
was
reversed
by
the
montana
supreme
court
and
the
solicitor
expresses
his
opinion
that
mr.
cline
has
received
all
the
relief
that
the
writ
of
habeas
of
corpus
can
provide.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
that
assertion
assumes
that
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
statute
can
do
nothing
more
than
affect
the
release
of
a
man
prison
and
i
would
direct
the
court’s
attention
to
this
court’s
opinion
and
carafas
v.
lavallee,
391
us,
234
in
which
this
issue
of
mootness
was
answered.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
well,
i
have
no
quarrel
if
the
charges
were
dismissed.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
i
maintain
your
honor
that
--
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
your
honor
at
the
first
trial
that
we
are
talking
about,
that
was
aborted,
there
were
nine
counts.
the
state
voluntarily
dismissed
one.
the
judge
on
his
own
motion
dismissed
three
more
and
then
the
prosecution
came
in
and
dismissed
the
remaining
counts.
it
came
back
and
filed
a
two
count
information.
we
went
to
trial
on
that.
it
is
my
position
that
mr.
cline
still
has
a
very
vested
interest
and
the
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
jeopardy
attached
at
that
first
trial.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
well,
mr.
cline
right
now
is
depending
this
appeal.
he
has
been
named
by
the
state
as
an
fle.
it
is
mr.
keller’s
representation
today
that
they
do
not
intend
to
further
pursue
the
matter.
it
is
the
first
that
i
have
ever
heard
of
that.
as
his
counsel
i
have
to
you
assume
that
since
they
are
prosecuting
the
appeal
that
they
intend
to
pursue
the
matter.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
what
i
am
saying
your
honor
is
that
there
still
are
five
counts
remaining
from
that
first
prosecution
that
if
jeopardy
had
not
attached,
conceivably
the
state
can
come
in
and
charge
him
on
those
five
counts.
they
only
filed
two
counts
the
second
time.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
that
is
correct.
we
still
have
a
five
accounts
that
are
kind
of
hanging
there.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
that
is
correct.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
that
is
correct.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
true
your
honor.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
no.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
we
got
two
separate
trials
that
we
are
talking
about.
we
started
out
with
a
nine
count
information
which
was
knocked
down
to
eight
counts
and
down
to
five
counts
and
then
the
prosecution
dismissed
those
five
and
came
back
and
only
filed
two.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
the
remaining
counts?
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
pardon
me?
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
i
think
that
it
is
arguable.
i
think
that
they
can
certainly
come
in
and
try
to
re-file
them.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
no,
sir.
i
am
saying
that
there
are
still
five
counts
that
were
not
dismissed
by
the
court.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
that
is
correct.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
no
sir.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
that
is
correct,
we
still
have
a
lingering
uncertainty
as
to
those
remaining
counts.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
i
think
so
and
i
would
further
submit
to
the
court
that
should
this
court
declare
that
mr.
cline’s
position
is
moot
that
the
effect
of
that
decision
is
to
say
that
double
jeopardy
rights
had
been
violated
only
has
a
remedy
if
he
has
been
convicted
and
i
think
the
double
jeopardy
protection
is
broader
than
that.
it
protects
the
man
from
having
to
stand
trial
twice
not
just
be
convicted.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
that
is
correct.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
assuming
my
position
is
correct
on
the
merits
of
this
case
that
jeopardy
did
attach
at
that
first
trial
and
we
have
the
trial
twice.
we
have
gone
through
two
trials.
i
am
projecting
an
uncertainty
about
a
third
trial
that
they
could
come
back
in
and
refile
in
those
remaining
five
counts
which
should
in
fact
can
be
a
third
trial.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
well,
as
in
the
fact
that
i
am
here
--
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
you
have
do
that,
i
--
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
well,
your
honor,
my
position
is
that
the
fact
that
i
am
here
defending
this
appeal
to
me
indicates
that
they
are
still
pursuing
this
matter
and
this
is
the
first
that
i
have
ever
heard
that
they
do
not
intend
re-cross
the
case
--
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
well,
i
think
the
jurisdiction
is
there
your
honor.
the
issue
has
been
raised.
mr.
cline
was
in
custody
at
the
time
the
district
court
assumed
jurisdiction.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
yes
sir.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
i
think
the
answer
to
that
your
honor
is
that
we
have
to
put
this
in
the
context
of
the
jurisdiction
attaching
in
the
federal
district
court.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
that
is
correct.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
that
is
correct.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
my
answer
your
honor
is
that
in
this
court
in
the
carafas
decision
said
that
once
habeas
jurisdiction
--
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
in
a
double
jeopardy
context
your
honor,
the
fact
still
remains
that
my
client
had
--
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
well,
i
would
submit
that
i
am
not
merely
engaging
in
speculation
when
i
am
defending
this
appeal
by
the
sate
of
montana
who
and
the
state
which
has
already
tried
my
client
twice
and
still
has
five
outstanding
counts
that
unless
jeopardy
attached,
they
can
re-file.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
i
submit
that
my
client
has
a
very
significant
interest.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
yes,
your
honor.
now,
as
to
the
merits
of
the
case,
mr.
keller
throughout
this
litigation
has
maintained
that
there
are
no
constitutional
policies
underlying
the
federal
rule,
the
rule
announced
by
this
court
and
downum
v.
united
states.
he
has
taken
the
position
at
the
montana
rule
offers
as
much
protection
to
a
defendant
as
does
the
downum
rule.
on
the
contrary,
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
historically
the
downum
rule
has
protected
two
basic
interests.
first
of
all,
it
protects
the
defendant
from
having
a
judge
or
a
prosecutor
dismiss
a
case
when
it
becomes
apparent
to
either
one
of
them
that
a
conviction
is
going
to
be
unlikely.
secondly
it
protects,
it
ensures
the
defendant
that
he
can
proceed
to
trial
before
a
particularly
chosen
tribunal.
now,
both
of
these
interests
are
best
served
by
having
jeopardy
attached
at
an
early
stage
in
the
trial
proceeding.
and
the
point
at
which
jeopardy
attaches
as
it
had
been
pointed
out
in
the
somerville
decision
merely
begins
the
inquiry
as
to
whether
or
not
there
a
double
jeopardy
interest
involved.
the
mere
fact
that
it
is
attached
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
the
defendant’s
double
jeopardy
interests
are
going
to
prevail.
for
example
in
the
somerville
case
the
interest,
in
sound
judicial
administration
and
the
ends
of
public
justice
were
the
prevailing
factors
and
so
it
is
just
a
matter
of
balancing
those
interest
out.
the
problem
with
moving
the
point
of
attachment
to
a
later
stage
in
the
proceeding
is
that
you
then
trade
a
period
of
time
during
which
the
prosecutor
can
ask
for
a
mistrial
or
dismissal
and
he
can
do
so
without
making
any
showing
of
manifest
necessity
or
extraordinary
circumstances.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
that
is
correct
your
honor,
but
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
sufficient
protection
because
the
trial
judge
does
have
the
guidelines
that
are
brought
into
play
by
the
attachment
of
jeopardy.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
well,
what
i
am
saying
is
that
i
think
that
the
attachment
of
jeopardy
rule
protects
essentially
two
interests.
number
one
protecting
the
defendant’s
right
to
proceed
before
a
particular
tribunal
and
secondly,
ensuring
a
judge
or
prosecutor
cannot
dismiss
when
they
think
that
a
conviction
is
unlikely
without
showing
manifest
necessity.
i
think
that
is
sufficiently
protected
under
the
downum
rule
and
what
i
am
saying
is
that
if
you
move
the
point
in
time
as
montana
has
done,
then
you
start
to
jeopardize
those
two
interests.
because
as
you
pointed
out,
during
that
period
of
time,
you
got
such
things
as
the
opening
statement
of
the
prosecutor
and
more
importantly,
you
have
got
the
possibility
of
an
opening
statement
by
the
defense
counsel.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
well,
i
think
if
we
are
going
to
make
any
sense
out
of
double
jeopardy
protection
in
the
state's
areas,
if
we
open
the
door,
if
the
court
opens
the
door
and
allows
the
states
to
adopt
their
own
rules
as
to
when
jeopardy
attaches,
then
conceivably
the
state
of
montana
is
free
to
adopt
a
rule
such
as
the
common
law
rule
that
jeopardy
does
not
attach
until
the
jury
verdict
comes
down
and
i
do
not
think
that
anybody
is
going
to
argue
that
that
is
going
to
protect
the
interest
which
have
become
associated
with
double
jeopardy
protection.
i
think
that
this
court
has
specifically
said
in
the
jorn
case
that
at
that
point
in
time
represents
a
point
in
time
at
which
time
constitutional
policies
come
into
play.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
justice
hurl,
i
think
writing
for
plurality.
i
should
point
out
that
this
court
in
illinois
v.
somerville
and
in
grieve
v.
jones
has
applied
the
downum
rule
to
the
state
of
illinois
and
the
state
of
california.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
that
is
correct.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
i
think
so
yes.
i
think
a
distinction
between
the
jury
and
a
non
jury
trial
is
that
in
terms
of
practice
in
a
non
jury
trial,
most
often
if
there
is
a
mistrial
or
dismissal
when
it
is
refilled
it
comes
back
in
front
of
the
same
judge
which
is
the
same
tribunal,
so
you
have
not
jeopardized
the
defendant.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
i
know
it
is
not
necessarily
so,
but
in
montana
as
a
matter
of
practice,
i
think
it
is,
whereas
in
the
jury
trial,
once
you
have
a
dismissal
or
a
mistrial,
the
second
time
around,
you
have
got
an
entirely
new
tribunal.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
your
question,
your
honor
is
do
those
things
affecting
the
tribunal
and
the
trier
of
fact?
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
yes.
in
fact,
i
think
a
very
good
argument
can
be
made
for
having
jeopardy
attached
in
an
earlier
time.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
but
the
counsel
for
the
appellant,
my
time?
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
the
counsel
for
the
appellant
has
put
forth
really
only
one
rationale
for
the
montana
rule
and
that
is
that
the
jury
prior
to
the
swearing
of
the
first
witness
has
nothing
to
consider.
well,
there
is
essentially
at
least
three
fallacies
with
that
argument
i
submit
because
number
one,
the
jury
does
have
something
to
consider
prior
to
the
swearing
of
the
first
witness.
the
jury
has
the
opening
statement
of
the
prosecutor
and
possibly
the
opening
statement
of
the
defense
counsel
and
i
was
listening
to
the
argument
in
court
here
yesterday
on
the
propriety
of
remarks
made
during
voir
dire
and
opening
statements
and
so
that
is
another
element
is,
questions
that
come
out
during
voir
dire
can
certainly
affect
the
jury.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
well,
your
honor,
i
am
thinking
of
more
than
just
damaging
statements.
i
am
thinking
of
things
that
oftentimes
a
defense
counsel
will
ask
the
jurors
what
their
thoughts
are
if
a
defendant
chooses
not
to
take
the
stand
and
try
to
feel
them
out
on
that
point.
he
is
tipping
his
hand
to
the
prosecution
as
to
the
approach
he
is
going
to
take
in
the
case.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
i
would
have
a
difficult
time
arguing
the
jeopardy
should
attach
any
time
prior
to
the
point
where
we
actually
know
what
the
composition
of
the
jury
panel
is
before
we
have
actually
chosen
the
tribunal.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
no,
sir.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
that
is
correct.
thank
you.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
appellants
in
this
case
have
taken
the
possession
that
the
so
called
valued
right
to
a
particular
tribunal
is
not
of
constitutional
stature,
rather
it
is
a
procedural
practice,
which
has
developed
out
of
english
common
law,
and
the
appellant
has
concluded
that
this
valued
right
to
a
particular
tribunal
does
not
come
into
play
or
does
not
attach
until
after
the
tribunal
has
actually
heard
the
defendant’s
case.
as
to
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
the
appellant
takes
the
position
in
his
brief
that
jeopardy
does
not
attach
until
after
the
state
has
presented
some
evidence
from
which
the
jury
could
actually
convict
the
defendant.
the
solicitor
on
the
other
hand
has
assumed
a
more
moderate
position
and
has
urged
this
court
that
jeopardy
should
attach
no
later
than
the
swearing
of
the
first
witness.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
--
this
--
the
court’s
recent
opinion
in
arizona
versus
washington
contradicts
both
the
position
of
the
appellant
and
of
the
solicitor.
in
the
arizona
case,
the
defense
counsel
engaged
in
some
references
during
his
opening
statement
to
inadmissible
evidence
and
as
a
consequence
of
that
reference,
the
trial
court
had
to
declare
a
mistrial
at
the
request
of
the
prosecution.
on
a
federal
habeas
corpus
appeal,
this
court
subjected
the
trial
court’s
actions
to
a
double
jeopardy
analysis
and
manifest
necessity
analysis
and
concluded
that
there
was
manifest
necessity
for
the
--
the
declaration
of
the
mistrial.
the
import
of
that
case
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
--
the
incident
arose
during
the
opening
statements
and
that
this
court
decided
that
case
on
the
grounds
of
double
jeopardy
even
though
the
first
witness
had
not
been
sworn.
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
implicit
in
the
arizona
decision,
is
a
conclusion
that
federal
double
jeopardy
had
attached,
at
least
as
early
as
the
opening
statement
and
of
course
the
opening
statement
is
prior
in
time
to
the
point
which
has
been
suggested
by
the
solicitor
and
is
prior
in
time
to
the
point
which
has
been
suggested
by
the
appellant.
if,
as
the
solicitor
has
argued,
double
jeopardy
interest
could
not
come
into
play
--
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
no,
your
honor.
what
i
--
what
i
am
saying
or
what
i
meant
to
say
is
this
the
fact
--
the
mere
fact
that
the
court
looked
at
the
double
jeopardy
problem
and
analyzed
the
case
in
terms
of
manifest
necessity,
meant
that
double
jeopardy
had
attached
at
least
as
early
as
the
time
the
error
occurred.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
excuse
me,
jeopardy
has
attached
at
least
that
early.
if
--
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
well,
respectfully
your
honor,
i
would
submit
that
the
--
the
fact
that
two
witnesses
had
testified
in
that
case
is
really
incidental
to
the
decision
because
the
--
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
no,
it
is
not.
that
is
what
is
being
argued,
but
--
in
that
particular
fact
situation,
the
error
arose
during
the
opening
statement
and
that
was
the
sole
basis
of
the
declaration,
i
think,
of
the
declaration
of
mistrial.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
i
would
--
i
think
that
the
fact
that
he
grounded
that
decision
upon
the
defense
counsel’s
improper
references
during
the
opening
statement
indicates
that
jeopardy
had
to
have
attached
at
least
that
early.
if
it
had
not
attached
at
the
time
of
the
opening
statements
were
made,
the
trial
judge
could
have
dismissed
the
case
immediately
upon
the
request
of
the
prosecution.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
hypothetically,
your
honor,
where
the
defense
counsel
reserves?
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
and
you
are
asking
when
was
jeopardy
attached
in
that?
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
well,
if
i
may
backtrack,
i
am
not
suggesting
that
the
arizona
case
specifically
sets
the
time
when
jeopardy
attaches
as
the
opening
statement.
i
am
just
saying
that
as
a
minimum,
it
says
that
it
had
to
have
attached
at
least
as
early
as
the
opening
statement.
if
i
--
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
triggering
factor
is
going
to
be
the
point
in
time
which
the
particular
tribunal
comes
into
existence.
we
are
talking
about
a
valued
right
to
a
particular
tribunal
and
i
--
i
am
not
going
to
argue
to
this
court
that
jeopardy
can
attach,
that
the
valued
right
has
any
meaning
prior
to
the
time
that
that
particular
tribunal
is
even
in
existence.
i
think
that
that
is
the
event
which
triggers
the
valued
right.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
i
do
not
--
i
do
not
think
the
case
goes
that
far,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
i
think
it
only
goes
as
far
as
saying
that
it
has
attached
at
least
at
the
time
of
the
opening
statements.
it
does
not
say
how
far
in
advance
of
that
time.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
no,
your
honor,
i
am
not.
i
do
not
think
that
is
consistent
with
the
“valued
right”
concept.
the
obviously
--
the
jury,
the
particular
tribunal
was
not
in
existence
at
the
time
when
motion
to
suppress
was
made,
but
what
i
am
saying
that
i
think
arizona
stands
for
is
that
if
jeopardy
had
not
attached
prior
to
the
swearing
of
the
first
witness,
i
do
not
think
the
trial
judge
would
have
even
had
to
concern
himself
with
the
“defendant’s
valued
right”
to
proceed.
he
could
have
declared
the
mistrial
without
any
concern
at
all
for
manifest
necessity.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
well,
i
think
that
he
was
merely
taking
the
prosecution’s
motion
under
advisement
while
he
had
a
chance
to
look
up
--
look
up
the
law
in
the
matter
and
i
do
not
think
that
the
fact
was
two
witnesses.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
well,
i
believe,
your
honor,
in
the
state
of
arizona,
that
it
is
attached
at
the
beginning
of
the
opening
statements,
but
i
do
not
think
that
the
arizona
law
controls
when
federal
double
jeopardy
attaches.
arizona
falls
right
in
between
the
two
points
that
are
being
argued
in
this
case,
but
i
do
not
think
that
is
the
controlling
factor
in
that
case,
in
the
--
in
the
arizona
state.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
well,
it
may
have
been
his
understanding
of
arizona
law,
your
honor,
but
for
purposes
of
the
arizona
decision
in
this
court,
that
--
that
was
a
question
of
--
of
federal
law
because
this
court
in
jorn
and
in
serfass
had
stated
that
the
attaching
of
the
jeopardy
rule
indicates
the
point
in
time
when
constitutional
policies
are
brought
into
play.
i
do
not
think
we
can
have
the
state
of
arizona
or
the
state
of
montana,
or
any
other
state
telling
the
united
states
supreme
court
when
constitutional
policies
were
brought
into
play.
that
is
--
that
is
why
i
say
i
think
it
is
implicit
in
that
decision,
by
the
mere
fact
that
the
court
engaged
in
a
double
jeopardy
analysis,
there
is
an
implicit
conclusion
that
federal
jeopardy
had
attached.
there
are,
i
think
two
other
points
which
have
been
raised
by
my
adversaries
which
are
answered
in
the
arizona
opinion.
first
of
all
the
appellant
has
taken
the
possession
that
the
valued
right
to
a
particular
tribunal
is
not
part
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
that
it
is
a
common
law
rule
or
procedure.
i
would
bring
the
court’s
attention
to
justice's
--
justice
stevens'
unequivocal
statement
in
the
arizona
opinion
where
he
points
out
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
embraces
the
defendant’s
valued
right
to
have
his
trial
completed
by
a
particular
tribunal
and
i
think
in
light
of
that,
there
is
no
question,
but
--
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
in
fact,
i
would
agree
with
that.
i
think
they
do.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
and
that
it
had
been
grafted
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
your
honor,
wade
against
hunter
was
a
court
marshal
case
and
i
think
there
can
be
certain
analogies
drawn
between
that
in
the
jury
trial
because
the
defendant
in
a
court
marshall
does
have
some
say
in
the
picking
of
the
--
of
the
fact-finder.
at
least,
i
--
as
i
understand
it
you
can
exercise
some
challenges
for
a
cause,
and
i
think
you
can
also
exercise
one
peremptory
challenge.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
i
do
not
know,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
just
--
just
to
the
very
limited
extent
that
the
defendant
does
have
some
say
so
in
picking
the
fact
--
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
yes.
the
solicitor
seems
to
argue
in
--
at
least
in
his
brief,
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
--
the
sole
purpose
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
to
protect
the
defendant
from
multiple
exposures
to
the
risk
of
conviction
and
certainly
the
double
jeopardy
clause
does
protect
that
interest,
but
i
think
that
this
court
in
a
number
of
opinions,
up
to
and
including
the
arizona
opinion,
has
taken
great
pains
to
point
out
that
the
clause
also
protects
the
“defendant’s
valued
right.”
and
when
the
court
says
the
valued
right
to
proceed
before
that
particular
tribunal,
that
includes
at
least
three
other
interests
that
protects
the
defendant
from
the
--
the
danger
of
having
to
engage
in
prolonged
period
of
financial
and
emotional
burden,
that
protects
the
defendant
from
a
prolonged
period
of
stigma
which
results
as
a
consequence
of
pending
criminal
charges
and
finally
and
very
importantly,
it
prevents
the
state
from
using
the
jury
as
a
prosecutorial
tool,
that
is
replacing
one
jury
with
another
jury
when
it
appears
that
the
state
would
be
unable
to
convict.
on
three
--
three
separate
places
within
the
arizona
opinion,
the
court
states
that
every
and
any
mistrial
declaration
inevitably
affects
the
defendant’s
constitutional
rights
under
the
valued
right
concept
and
i
emphasize
the
words
“any
and
every
mistrial
declaration”
because
i
think
that
the
use
of
those
words
points
out
that
the
interest
which
is
being
protected
--
are
being
protected
do
not
hinge
upon
in
any
way
the
swearing
of
the
first
witness.
we
are
talking
about
the
interests
which
come
into
play
as
soon
as
that
particular
tribunal
has
been
empaneled.
the
fact
that
the
witness
is
sworn
in
really
has
--
is
of
no
consequence
in
terms
of
the
interest,
which
come
under
the
valued
right.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
well
he
cannot,
your
honor,
but
i
--
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
well,
i
am
saying
that
this
court
has
interpreted
the
--
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
well,
in
terms
of
actually
being
convicted,
he
is
not
in
jeopardy,
but
i
think
this
court
has
interpreted
the
double
jeopardy
clause
as
including
a
valued
right
to
proceed
before
the
jury
first
empaneled
and
i
think
that
--
that
--
that
interest
attaches
immediately
upon
the
empaneling
of
the
jury.
we
are
talking
about
something
broader
than
just
the
--
the
mere
risk
of
conviction.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
well,
i
think
that
depends
on
a
particular
case
we
are
talking
about.
it
is
conceivable
that
the
jury
could
be
empaneled
on
a
friday
afternoon,
you
could
have
a
weekend
recess,
opening
statements
may
take
a
long
time,
defense
counsel
as
well
as
the
prosecution
may
make
motions.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
that
is
correct
and
it
may
be
a
matter
of
seconds.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
that
is
correct.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
what
would
not
be
much
good,
your
honor
then?
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
well,
the
--
conceivably,
the
prosecutor
can
still
stand
up
and
move
to
dismiss
the
jury
even
though
he
has
only
got
one
minute
to
do
it.
i
think
his
motives
are
going
to
be
pretty
transparent,
but
he
can
do
it.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
well
no,
i
am
arguing
against
that
position,
your
honor.
i
--
i
am
just
saying
that
i
do
not
think
that
--
i
do
not
think
the
fact
that
a
witness
has
been
sworn
--
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
that
is
correct.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
right.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
correct.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
between
those
two
points?
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
it
could
be.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
your
honor,
mr.
cline
is
out
--
out
of
jail.
i
have
not
--
i
have
not
raised
the
question
of
mootness.
as
i
answered
last
time,
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
cline’s
interest
in
this
case
lies
in
the
fact
that
should
this
court
reverse
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
there
is
the
very
clear
possibility
that
the
state,
if
it
wants
to
then
can
re-prosecute
him
on
some
of
the
other
seven
counts,
which
were
involved
in
this
case.
he
--
he
has
a
very
definite
interest
in
saying
--
into
the
saying
that
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
he
--
he
is
the
appellee
in
this
case.
i
am
here
merely
representing
him.
the
state
is
the
one
that
has
chosen
to
appeal
and
from
that,
i
gather
that
they
still
have
an
interest
in
prosecuting
mr.
cline.
in
this
court,
i
--
i
cannot
cite
the
cases
to
you
right
now.
i
have
got
them
in
my
briefcase
if
you
would
like,
but
the
case
--
the
court
is
held
on
two
different
occasions,
i
think
that
the
remedies
available
under
the
habeas
corpus
statutes
are
broader
in
scope
and
mere
--
merely
releasing
a
man
from
prison
that
it
can
rectify
the
--
the
situation
at
hand.
mr.
w.
william
leaphart
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
