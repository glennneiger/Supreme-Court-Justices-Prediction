justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
have
to
argue
that
by
implication
when
the
montana
statute
says
retrial
may
be
had
--
may
not
be
had
under
certain
circumstances,
yet
impliedly
authorizes
retrial
under
the
circumstances
where
it
does
not
prohibit
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
we
were
to
follow
or
adopt
your
reasoning
on
this
point,
it
would
not
change
the
rule
in
the
federal
system,
would
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
saying
that
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
your
concept
of
jeopardy
is
part
of
the
bill
of
rights
and
incorporates
the
double
jeopardy
clause
and
that
it
would
be
applicable
both
in
the
federal
and
the
state
system?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
would
also
be
assuming,
would
you
not
that
when
benton
v.
maryland
said
that
double
jeopardy
was
incorporated
into
the
fourteenth
amendment,
it
meant
all
the
bag
and
baggage
of
the
federal
prohibition
rather
than
just
the
general
outline
of
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
that
is
ultimately
a
decision
for
this
court,
not
for
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
the
ninth
circuit's
ruling
in
effect
you
get
a
complete
immunity
on
all
nine
counts
or
you
just
say
you
are
uncertain
with
respect
to
the
result
if
it
is
just
depends
on
the
decisions
of
supreme
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
say
that
is
enough
to
justify
habeas?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
jorn
a
court
opinion
or
was
it
just
a
plurality
opinion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
pretrial
publicity
that
occurs
a
month
before
the
case
is
set
for
trial?
that
can
have
some
influence
on
the
jurors.
surely
you
would
not
argue
that
jeopardy
attaches
a
month
before
the
case
is
set
for
trial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
all
statutes
were
presumed
constitutional,
counsel?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
certainly,
no
one
suggests
it
is
a
conclusive
presumption.
180
years
of
decision
of
this
court
show
otherwise,
but
you
are
talking
about
who
the
burden
of
proof
should
be
on
as
to
unconstitutionality?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
have
to
--
i
would
think
if
you
are
going
to
depart
from
the
constitution
no
showing
would
justify
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
do
the
montana
judges
not,
at
the
time
of
the
filling
of
venire
into
the
box,
make
some
very
brief
statement
that
this
is
a
criminal
case
and
such
and
such
is
the
charge
and
that
sort
of
thing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
should
--
why
should
the
so-called
“valued
right
of
the
defendant”
to
go
to
trial
before
the
first
jury
depend
entirely
on
when
the
defendant’s
lawyer
has
committed
himself,
as
you
put
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
i
am
asking
you
to
do
is
to
perhaps
do
what
lord
coke
did
not
and
supply
a
reason
for
the
statement
you
make
that
the
commencement
of
the
“defendant’s
valued
right”
begins
with
the
point
when
the
defendant’s
counsel
has
committed
himself,
why
should
that
be?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
with
many
hung
jury
cases
that
is
the
classical
reason
for
granting
a
mistrial
and
permitting
the
prosecution
to
start
over
again?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
more
or
less
just
volunteering
as
if
it
is
of
no
concern
to
the
united
states
as
a
litigant,
i
take
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
judge
did
not
declare
the
mistrial
until
two
witnesses
had
testified?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
it
in
arizona
versus
washington
that
makes
you
say
it
has
come
into
existence
at
the
point
that
the
jury
is
sworn?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
do
not
either.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
--
but
i
do
not
think
then
you
--
you
have
satisfied
me
as
to
my
brother
steven’s
earlier
question,
that
supposing
in
mid-trial
after
several
witnesses
have
sworn,
the
trial
judge
grants
a
motion
to
suppress
evidence
as
a
result
of
illegal
conduct
that
took
place
four
or
five
weeks
before
the
trial.
now,
surely
you
are
not
going
to
say
that
the
double
--
that
the
jeopardy
attached
at
the
time
that
search
and
seizure
took
place,
are
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
he
had
--
he
granted
it
when
two
witnesses
had
been
sworn
and
testified?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
was
in
world
war
ii?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
justice
black
wrote
a
dissenting
opinion
