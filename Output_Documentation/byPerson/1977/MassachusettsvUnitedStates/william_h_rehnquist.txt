justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
court
of
appeals
ever
address
itself
to
the
question
of
whether
the
general
language
of
the
statute
meant
that
the
tax
should
be
applicable
to
state-owned
vehicles.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
is
some
language
in
some
of
our
cases
which
is
treated
in
part
in
the
fright
case,
which
came
out
the
other
way
i
think
that
even
though
you
have
general
language,
sometimes
you
require
more
than
that
in
order
to
apply
a
particular
regulation
or
a
tax
to
a
state.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
mr.
o'malley
what
if
120-
130
years
ago,
whenever
it
was
a
crucial,
national
issue,
the
federal
government
had
build
a
toll
road
over
the
appalachians
and
it
charged
everybody
who
was
pulling
a
wagon
over
that
toll
road,
whatever
say
a
dollar.
do
you
think
a
state
could
have
claimed
immunity
from
that
sort
of
a
charge?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
the
helicopter
uses
the
services
made
possible
by
title
1
every
time
the
helicopter
lifts
off
the
pad,
do
you
disagree
with
your
opponent's
response
to
mr.
justice
steven's
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
could
the
federal
government
open
a
store
up
in
boston,
kind
of
a
px
type
store
would
have
price
items
and
tax
the
state
of
massachusetts
for
the
privilege
of
using
the
store
even
though
it
decided
never
to
use
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
it
that
the
government
owns
that
is
being
charged
for
the
use
of
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
know
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
nothing.
