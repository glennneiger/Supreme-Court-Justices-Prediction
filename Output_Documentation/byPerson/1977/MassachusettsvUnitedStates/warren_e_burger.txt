chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
number
1500,
massachusetts
against
the
united
states.
mr.
o'malley,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
many
aircrafts
does
the
state
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
defied
with
this
if
the
wagons
were
carrying
ammunition
to
valley
forge.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
leave
me
a
little
confused
there.
but
for
some
purposes
the
state,
the
federal
government
could
make
a
use
charge
but
for
some
purposes
they
could
not.
and
on
each
of
them,
there
are
two
sovereigns.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
usually
tolls
on
toll
roads
are,
if
not
always,
dedicated
an
earmark
to
amortize
the
bond
issue,
that
was
the
basis
of
building
it.
you
don't
have
in
this
case
i
take
it,
a
impounding
of
this
use
charge.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
federal
government
had
spent
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
on
river
channels
in
order
to
make
river
navigation
feasible.
on
your
theory
could
they
charge
a
state-
owned
barges
for
carrying
tasks
for
the
state?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
surely
some
of
the
massachusetts
travelers
are
reimbursed
by
the
state,
are
you
suggesting
that
it
was
a
demeanor
or
something?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
the
problem
is
that--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
are
your
arrangements
on
the
automobiles?
any
of
them
subject
to
any
tax?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr
ryan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
what
i
wish
to
make
is
your
legal
position,
as
i
understand
it,
does
not
depend
on
the
aircraft
actually
making
use
of
anything
that
the
federal
government
spends
money
for.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
there
is
a
difference
because
of
the
toll
fees
are
explicitly
impounded
for
the
purpose
of
discharging
the
bonds
issued
to
build
the
road
and
situation
presented
by
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
my
question
is
broader
than
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
going
to
make
them
pay
the
capital
costs,
that
is
what
the
toll
roads
do.
the
toll
charged
on
a
toll
road
is
to
pay
the
capital
cost
of
building
the
road.
you
are
not
dealing
with
the
capital
cost
here
precisely,
are
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
this
record
show
or
do
you
know
what's
the
total
amount
of
revenue
that
the
federal
government
achieves
under
this
program
over
the
whole
country.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
very
much
money
i
suspect,
is
it?
it
is
not
a
great
sum
of
money
in
the
todays
fiscal
arrangements
between
states
and
federal
government.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
total.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
anything
further
mr.
o'malley.
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinions
of
the
court
in
massachusetts
against
the
united
states
and
in
the
case
of
city
of
lafayette
against
louisiana
power
and
light
company
will
each
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
brennan.
