justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
massachusetts
v.
the
united
states
is
here
on
certiorari
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit.
the
airport
and
airway
revenue
act
of
1970,
a
federal
statute
imposes
an
annual
flat
fee
registration
tax
on
all
civil
aircraft,
including
such
aircraft
owned
by
the
states
and
by
the
federal
government,
that
fly
in
the
navigable
airspace
of
the
united
states.
that
tax
was
imposed
upon
a
helicopter
owned
by
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
and
used
by
the
state
in
the
state
police
work.
the
commonwealth
instituted
this
action
contending
that
the
united
states
may
not
constitutionally
impose
a
tax
that
directly
affects
the
central
and
traditional
state
function
of
uprating
a
police
force.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
registration
tax
was
a
user
fee
and
therefore
did
not
implicate
the
constitutional
doctrine
of
the
implied
immunity
of
state
governments
from
federal
taxation.
we
affirm,
the
opinion
i
have
filed
for
the
court
is
joined
in
its
entirety
by
justices
white,
marshall
and
stevens,
but
justices
stewart
and
powell
joined
only
parts
1,
2c
and
3,
they
have
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
mr.
chief
justice
has
joined,
mr.
justice
blackmun
took
no
part
in
the
decision
or
consideration
of
the
case.
