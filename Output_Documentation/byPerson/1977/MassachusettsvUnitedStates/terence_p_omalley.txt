mr.
terence
p.
o'malley
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
court
has
granted
the
petition
of
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
to
issue
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states,
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit.
the
basic
issue
raised
on
review
concerns
the
constitutionality
of
applying
the
federal
excise
tax
on
the
use
of
civil
aircraft
to
a
state
police
helicopter
owned
by
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
and
use
exclusively
for
public
safety
purposes.
the
action
was
initiated
by
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
in
the
united
states,
district
court
of
the
district
of
massachusetts
on
a
petition
to
refund
of
the
tax.
the
tax
computed
is
computed
by
$25
flat
fee
plus
a
varying
amount
based
on
the
weight
of
the
aircraft.
the
tax
was
$131.43
for
the
taxable
year
ended
june
30th
1971.
the
total
collected
by
a
levy
on
funds
of
a
commonwealth
was
$183.38.
the
commonwealth
alleged
in
its
--
mr.
terence
p.
o'malley
for
this
taxable
year,
your
honor,
that's
not
an
accurate
indicate
of
how
much
money
would
be
involved
in
the
years
between
now
and
then.
mr.
terence
p.
o'malley
the
state
police
has
one,
the
state
aeronautics
commission
has
three
and
there
is
large
bill
pending
for
those
aircraft
also.
but
it's
not
--it
hasn't
been
litigated,
it's
in
abance
pending
disposition
of
this
case.
mr.
terence
p.
o'malley
other
aircraft
owned
by
the
massachusetts
aeronautics
commission
and
there
are
tax
bills
in
abance
of
a
much
larger
figure
than
the
$180.
talking
about
strictly
for
this
year
1971.
commonwealth
alleged
that
the
helicopter
was
used
by
the
state
police
only
for
public
safety
purposes
such
as
promoting
highway
safety
and
conducting
searches
for
suspected
criminals
or
escapees
from
correctional
facilities.
the
united
states
moved
to
dismiss
the
complaint,
prepared
a
state
acclaimed
on
which
relief
could
be
granted.
the
district
court
allowed
the
motion
stating
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
talking
about
state
immunity
from
federal
taxation
were
essentially
of
historical
interest
only.
and
the
court
also
stated
that
this
is
a
classic
case
of
a
user
fee.
that
rationale
was
based
on
the
fact
that
the
revenue
derived
from
these
aircraft
taxes
is
used
to
make
grants
to
state-owned
airports
or
airport
expansion
and
development.
on
appeal
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
but
only
discussed
the
user
fee
rationale.
that
rationale
was
based
largely
on
an
analogy,
the
team
concerning
cases
of
this
court
which
upheld
forfeit
fees
by
municipalities
as
not
in
violation
of
the
constitutional
prohibition
against
duties
on
tonnage.
commonwealth
petitioned
this
court
to
certiorari.
the
solicitor
general
agreed
that
the
case
should
be
resolved
because
there
was
a
decision
by
a
federal
court
in
georgia
which
has
sustained
the
immunity
of
georgia
from
this
particular
tax.
the
essential
position
of
the
commonwealth,
that
this
particular
tax
violates
the
constitutional
principle
of
intergovernmental
tax
immunity.
the
basic
defense
of
the
united
states
is
that
this
tax
is
also
a
users
fee
and
therefore
exempt
from
the
principal.
the
commonwealth
view
the
argument
will
be
broken
down
in
to
three
basic
parts.
first
of
all
that
there
is
no
exception
to
the
principle
of
intergovernmental
tax
immunity
for
taxes
which
are
also
designated,
user
fees.
second,
that
even
if
we
discuss
the
user
fee
rationale,
the
taxing
question
even
fails
on
those
terms.
third,
i
would
briefly
discuss
the
implications
of
the
case
of
national
league
of
cities
v.
usery,
concerning
the
position
of
the
commonwealth
here.
mr.
terence
p.
o'malley
it
was
agreed
by
all
that
the
commonwealth
does
come
within
the
definition
because
the
definition
concerns
all
aircrafts
which
are
registered
or
must
be
registered
with
the
faa.
this
aircraft
was
registered
and
we
believe
must
be
registered
with
the
faa.
mr.
terence
p.
o'malley
there
is
also
legislative
history,
your
honor,
which
explains
why
the
exemption
from
the
passage
of
tax,
that
used
to
exist
for
government
employees,
that's
no
longer
in
effect.
and
the
legislative
history
states
that
they
think
all
aircrafts
should
pay
their
way
for
the
use
of
the
aircraft
system.
so
that
issue
was
never
really
raised
and
we
do
not
contest
the
applicability
of
the
tax
as
matter
of
statutory
construction.
the
tax
is
clearly
a
tax
irrespective
of
whether
or
not
we
also
describe
it
as
a
users
fee.
as
such
it
clearly
comes
within
the
scope
of
the
principle
as
historically
stated.
first
of
all,
there
is
a
direct
imposition
on
the
funds
of
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts.
second
of
all
even
though
the
amount
of
the
tax
is
not
excessive
in
its
direct
terms,
it's
only
$131
for
this
year.
in
all
decisions
concerning
the
principle
of
tax
immunity
whether
it's
federal
immunity
or
state
immunity
the
court
has
always
stated
that
the
amount
is
immaterial.
the
basic
issue
is
whether
or
not
there
is
a
an
infringement
of
sovereignty
not
whether
or
not
the
tax
in
question
is
excessive.
it
also
is
--
mr.
terence
p.
o'malley
no,
we
deny,
your
honor,
if
a
particular
charge
is
not
a
tax
but
strictly
a
fee,
such
as
a
toll,
for
the
use
of
a
particular
road
owned
by
the
united
states,
we
would
not
claim
free
usage
of
the
road
just
as
we
do
not
claim
as
the
government
says,
that
we
think
we
should
be
able
to
use
mails
for
free.
we
have
to
buy
the
the
stamps
like
everyone
else.
mr.
terence
p.
o'malley
yes
your
honor,
the
crux
of
the
issue
is
that
there
is
a
direct
imposition
on
the
commonwealth's
funds
for
the
general
support
of
government
rather
than
the
individual
act
of
a
proprietor
trying
to
get
compensation
for
the
use
of
it.
mr.
terence
p.
o'malley
well,
if
we
proved
the
factual
matter,
there
was
a
great
infringement
on
the
sovereignty
because
of
the
unique
fact
like
that,
i
think
may
be
that
would
be
a
separate
case
but
as
a
general
proposition,
the
proprietorship
type
fee,
we
do
not
challenge.
mr.
terence
p.
o'malley
if
i
may
backtrack
a
bit,
your
honor,
our
basic
position
is
that
if
it
is
a
tax,
and
we
don't
think
that
the
type
of
toll
concerning
the
use
of
a
road
is
a
tax,
i
think
your
question
you
related
to,
if
the
imposition
of
the
toll,
somehow
or
another
prevented
that
it
really
threatened
the
existence
of
a
state
or
of
a
governmental
entity,
that
would
raise
separate
issues
which
we
don't
think
are
involved
in
--
mr.
terence
p.
o'malley
the
revenue
derived
from
this
charge
does
go
in
to
a
trust
fund
in
the
treasury
and
that
money
is
used
to
make
grants
to
the
states
for
airport
expansion
and
development.
now,
the
facilities
are
still
owned
by
the
states
or
their
subdivisions
and
the
money
is
used,
however
to
further
--
the
tax
here
though
is
a
tax
on
the
use
of
a
navigable
airspace.
it
does
not
specifically
geared
to
a
particular
use
such
as
driving
over
a
toll
road
and
paying
a
one
time
charge
for
it.
at
some
point
these
charges
may
--
the
lines
of
distinction
become
fine
ones
but
in
this
case
it
has
never
been
contested
that
this
is
not
really
a
tax,
the
only
argument
has
been
that
it
also
has
aspects
of
being
a
use
of
shape.
mr.
terence
p.
o'malley
i
do
not
think
that
could
make
a
direct
tax
of
the
states
because
they
happen
to
use
--
have
designated
this
particular
revenue
for
river
improvements,
however,
if
on
a
one
time
basis,
there
is
an
agency
that
has
a
particular
expense
and
has
a
charge
against
both,
for
the
particular
use
and
its
clearly
user's
fee
and
it
does
not
involve
those
sovereign
issues
such
as
the
levying
on
funds
of
a
state
or
exerting
the
power
who
even
sees
the
facilities
of
a
state,
because
they
want
to
enforce
this
revenue
contribution.
the
different
considerations
that
--
mr.
terence
p.
o'malley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
terence
p.
o'malley
now,
they
do
your
honor.
mr.
terence
p.
o'malley
the
legislative
history
--
mr.
terence
p.
o'malley
a
legislature
repealed
the
exemption
for
the
employees
and
i
think
the
tax
here
is
quite
different
because
at
least
it's
user
oriented
in
that
case,
your
honor.
there
are
a
number
of
exceptions
that
are
recognized
in
the
immunity
principle,
so
that
there
is
no
question
about
the
federal
power
raised
revenue
being
unduly
interfered
with.
in
other
words,
the
states
have
to
be
engaging
in
the
sovereign
function
and
they
cannot
immunize
contract
as
all
of
the
employees
from
incidental
federal
taxes.
these
type
of
considerations
have
often
been
recognized
but
the
fact
is
that
no
other
exception
has
ever
been
recognized
for
taxes
such
as
this,
where
the
government
claims,
they
have
a
particular
use
if
they
want
to
make
for
this
particular
revenue.
the
sole
argument
that
the
government
seems
to
make
is
that
this
court
should
analagyse
this
tax
with
taxes
that
are
enacted
from
interstate
carriers
or
even
state
highways.
we
consider
the
questions
involved
in
an
undue
burden
of
interstate
commerce
issue
quite
different
from
the
sovereignty
issues
raised
in
the
tax
immunity
argument.
the
interstate
commerce
burden
question
necessarily
involves
a
question
of
degree.
the
relative
judgments
have
to
be
made
but
in
terms
of
the
constitutional
principle
involving
the
status
of
the
states
under
the
constitution,
questions
of
degree
do
not
illuminate
whether
or
not
there
is
actually
an
infringement
in
the
constitutional
sense.
but
even
when
reference
is
made
to
the
user
fee
argument,
there
are
two
aspect
that
the
commonwealth
wishes
to
raise.
first
of
all,
this
case
was
decided
on
a
motion
to
dismiss.
in
the
first
instance,
whether
or
not
there
has
been
an
approximate
benefit
relative
to
the
amount
of
the
tax
would
raise
the
factual
question
which
probably
would
have
to
require
a
hearing
but
more
importantly,
we
think
the
failure
of
the
user
fee
to
even
qualify
as
such
in
this
case
indicates
that
this
type
of
innovation
is
unworthy
in
the
tax
immunity
area
because
even
though
different
difficult
factual
issues
will
be
raised,
they
do
not
illuminate
the
questions
of
sovereignty
that
are
involved
here
that
are
not
involved
in
cases
where
you
have
an
interstate
carrier
claiming
that
their
activities
are
being
unduly
burdened.
mr.
terence
p.
o'malley
yes,
when
they
use
it
in
the
form
of
a
tax.
if
there
is
another
way
to
exact
an
administrative
charge
and
it's
based
on
a
voluntary
participation
in
a
particular
program
or
use
of
a
particular
road
then
--
mr.
terence
p.
o'malley
we
have
not
your
honor,
there
is
question
there
whether
or
not
the
incidence
of
the
tax
is
actually
on
the
commonwealth
of
the
state
or
on
the
particular
employees
who
then
may
or
may
not
get
reimbursed
by
the
government.
well
there
is
that
separate
issue
there,
there
is
no
question
here
but
that
the
internal
revenue
agents,
in
this
case
levied
on
funds
of
the
commonwealth
quite
directly.
mr.
terence
p.
o'malley
no,
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
more
analogous
to
the
cases
where
the
salaries
of
government
employees
that
once
considered
immune
from
federal
taxation
but
that
particular
aspect
of
the
doctrine
is
since
been
discarded
because
--
just
because
the
state
has
to
perhaps
make
up
the
difference
in
order
to
supply
a
wage
and
cover
that
tax,
the
connection
between
the
state
and
the
imposition
of
the
taxes
was
more
remote
and
do
not
justify
the
protection
that
they
thought
the
constitution
required.
the
formula
in
this
case
only
involved
weight,
there
was
no
formula
which
speaks
of
the
amount
of
the
use
of
the
system
concerning
the
amount
of
a
tax,
but
even
when
you
get
beyond
the
formula
and
you
look
to
the
result,
the
user
fee
is
not
proved
to
be
a
rough
accommodation,
approximation
of
the
amount
of
use
of
a
system.
the
secretary
of
transportation
was
required
by
congress
in
this
act
to
make
a
cost
allocation
study
concerning
whether
or
not
these
charges
were
actually
geared
to
in
any
way,
the
use
of
a
system.
the
secretary's
findings
are
clear
that
the
amount
of
the
tax
is
not
related
to
the
use
of
the
system.
now,
this
is
a
report
filed
by
the
federal
official
chart
with
the
regulation
of
the
airways
and
it
should
be
given
considerable
weight
by
this
court
and
should
also
be
an
indication
that
getting
into
this
type
of
problem
in
the
sovereignty
area
is
not
a
productive
one
because
it
in
no
way
illuminates
what
we
consider
to
be
the
basic
question
of
power
rather
than
the
question
of
degree.
finally,
the
united
states
really
does
not
address
the
failure
of
this
particular
tax
to
work
out
as
a
rough
approximation
of
the
use
of
a
system.
rather
it
makes
a
comparison
that
the
commonwealth
in
this
particular
year
involved
did
receive
$1.5
million
in
grants
for
airport
expansion
and
development
and
then
compute
it
with
the
amount
of
the
tax.
we
think
this
is
clearly
indicative
of
why
it
would
not
be
appropriate
to
use
the
user
fee
issue
in
the
tax
immunity
area.
first
of
all,
the
amount
awarded
was
pursuant
to
a
matching
grant
program.
these
are
the
type
of
programs
that
are
often
used
in
federal
state
areas
such
as
welfare
and
education.
they
have
programs
of
co-operative
federalism.
the
united
states
states
does
not
mention,
first
of
all,
they
don't
mention
that
this
is
a
matching
grant
program
and
second
of
all
they
do
not
mention
the
amount
that
the
commonwealth
supplied
in
programs
of
this
nature.
if
necessary,
the
commonwealth
would
prove
that
the
commonwealth
supplied
$346,000
to
meet
the
grants
made
by
the
federal
government.
now,
if
this
figure
are
degree
of
matching
grant
is
not
satisfactory,
then
congress
would
be
free
to
change
the
formulas
so
that
the
state
had
to
supply
more
money.
but
at
least
it
would
be
done
on
a
voluntary
cooperative
federal
state
basis
and
it
would
not
require
the
unilateral
and
potentially
cohesive
measure
such
as
the
tax
and
measuring
question
here.
and
finally
in
the
cases
involving
the
use
of
the
highways
and
their
requirement
to
pay
their
way
in
interstate
commerce,
the
court
has
always
been
satisfied
that
the
highways
were
provided
by
the
states
and
the
states
were
really
just
demanding
compensation
for
the
use
of
the
highways,
and
if
the
state
was
really
in
a
proprietary
capacity
for
the
most
part
in
making
the
charge.
in
this
case
the
tax
is
on
the
use
of
the
navigable
airspace.
the
federal
government
does
not
own
the
airspace
and
even
when
reference
is
made
to
the
airport
facilities,
there
are
still
state
based
facilities
that
is
either
owned
by
the
state
or
the
political
subdivisions
and
in
some
cases
these
facilities
may
or
may
not
receive
federal
funding.
this
indicates
how
we
have
difficulty
in
approximating
the
amount
of
use
with
the
amount
of
a
tax,
the
difficulty
also
added
in
this
case
is
that
we
are
not
even
sure
what
the
use
of
what
facility
is
being
compensated
for,
by
levying
a
tax
on
the
use
of
a
navigable
air
space.
mr.
terence
p.
o'malley
pardon
me
your
honor.
mr.
terence
p.
o'malley
there
are
federal
employees
involved
at
airports
but
the
airport
facilities
themselves
apart
from
the
national
airport
and
dallas
airport
are
not
federally
owned
facilities.
mr.
terence
p.
o'malley
yes
your
honor,
generally
they
do
participate
in
the
programs
but
also
to
be
noted
your
honor
is
that
there
are
limitations
as
to
what
part
of
the
facility
these
funds
are
available
for.
for
example,
they
don't
give
money
for
the
use
of
terminal
facilities.
it's
mostly
directed
towards
the
actual
airport
side.
mr.
terence
p.
o'malley
as
i
understand
it,
the
grants
here
are
made
to
the
states
to
provide
the
facilities.
mr.
terence
p.
o'malley
yes
there
federal
funds
involved
in
these
programs
and
again
there
are
matching
funds
to
varying
extents
under
the
statute.
mr.
terence
p.
o'malley
there
is
a
considerable
federal
regulation
--
mr.
terence
p.
o'malley
in
terms
of
the
rules
enacted
by
the
federal
aviation
administration
with
some
federal
aviation
administration
personnel
involved
in
implementing
the
measure
on.
mr.
terence
p.
o'malley
well,
some
of
them,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
i
think
some
of
the
facilities
and
the
equipment
is
provided
by
the
grants
of
the
nature
involved
here
but
that
the
states
are
involved
in
it.
may
be
--
mr.
terence
p.
o'malley
there
may
be
a
subdivision
of
the
various
facilities
that
would
only
be
--
mr.
terence
p.
o'malley
no
your
honors,
it
was
decided
strictly
on
the
basis
of
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
the
user
fee
rationale
is
actually
evolved.
in
this
case,
it's
gone
along
rather
than
something
that
was
clearly
understood
at
the
beginning.
mr.
terence
p.
o'malley
certainly
not
your
honor.
mr.
terence
p.
o'malley
air
force?
mr.
terence
p.
o'malley
we
are
talking
about
the
commercial
aircrafts
in
general
aviation.
mr.
terence
p.
o'malley
in
one
form
or
another,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
terence
p.
o'malley
certainly
your
honor
,
the
tax
is
on
--
mr.
terence
p.
o'malley
it
would
be
based
solely
on
the
weight
of
the
aircraft
and
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
use.
a
helicopter
by
a
chance
would
use
these
facilities
less
that
an
airplane
would
because
of
its
maneuverability.
the
costly
feature
involved
in
making
these
grants
is
concerning
the
terminal
airspace.
mr.
terence
p.
o'malley
certainly
could
your
honor
and
very
often
it
does.
mr.
terence
p.
o'malley
i
don't
think
this
case
should
turn
of
helicopter
but
it
is
strictly
a
state
aircraft
use
for
public
safety
purposes
and
if
the
aircraft
did
use
the
--
if
it
were
the
argument
would
not
differ
your
honor.
mr.
terence
p.
o'malley
the
fuel
tax,
if
there's
an
exemption
on
the
fuel
tax
for
the
state
crude
because
i
don't
believe
there's
any
other
federal
tax
involved
and
the
state
does
not
tax
its
own
property
in
that
fashion.
the
final
point
is
that
while
most
of
the
discussion
of
the
tax
immunity
is
contained
in
older
cases
and
perhaps
considered
by
man
to
be
just
an
old
historical
doctrine,
we
believe
that
the
court's
recent
decision
in
the
national
league
of
cities
v.
usery
dramatically
shows
of
the
concepts
of
a
state
sovereignty
that
are
at
the
very
core
of
the
complaint
raised
in
this
case
are
still
very
much
alive,
in
that
case
the
court
was
concerned
with
the
exercise
of
the
commerce
clause
power
but
i
think
the
court
implicitly,
if
not
explicitly,
recognized
the
continuing
vitality
of
this
constitutional
principle
and
was
clear
to
state
that
were
not
going
to
resolve
a
case
on
a
particularized
assessment
of
impact.
the
particular
federal
statute
was
declared
unconstitutional
because
this
fine
would
fringe
upon
the
essential
role
of
a
states
in
our
union
and
we
think
that
this
case
requires
similar
treatment.
therefore,
we
think
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeal
should
be
reversed.
