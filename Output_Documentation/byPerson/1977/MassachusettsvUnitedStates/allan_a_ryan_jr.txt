mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
1970,
congress
enacted
a
law
entitled
an
act
to
provide
for
an
expansion
and
improvement
of
the
nation's
airport
and
airways
system
and
for
the
imposition
of
the
airport
and
airway
user
charges.
this
act
was
divided
into
two
titles.
title
1,
the
airport
and
airway
development
act
authorized
the
secretary
of
transportation,
to
spend
a
great
deal
of
money
to
improve
the
nation's
airports
and
the
services
which
make
air
travel
safe,
services
such
as
air
traffic
control,
communication
and
navigation
aids.
title
2,
the
airport
and
airway
revenue
act
imposed
or
increased
charges
on
those
who
use
the
nation's
airports
and
such
supporting
services.
one
of
those
charges
is
that
a
issue
here,
a
charge
or
tax
on
the
use
of
any
taxable
civil
aircraft
of
$25
per
year
or
plus
a
few
cents
propound.
title
2
also
established
a
trust
fund
to
ensure
that
the
funds
raised
by
the
charges
in
title
2
would
help
pay
for
the
improvements
required
by
title
1.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
which
uses
the
services
made
possible
by
title
1,
every
time
its
helicopter
lifts
off
the
pad
must
pay
its
share
of
the
cost
imposed
by
title
2.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
do
although,
i
think
that
--
strictly
speaking
as
a
factual
matter
it's
not
reflected
by
this
record.
i
make
that
statement
because
i
think
that
something
that
--
can
be
presumed
and
to
that
extent
i
do
disagree.
i
think
it
is
physically
possible
as
mr.
justice
stevens
perhaps
was
suggesting,
that
a
helicopter
could
take
off
from
a
hospital
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
not
in
the
taking
off
process
i
don't
believe
mr.
justice.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
well,
i
am
not
an
expert.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
no
it
does
not,
not
strictly
speaking.
and
if
you
tell
me
that
this
helicopter
can
take
off
and
fly
over
a
logan
airport.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
yes
it
does.
i
would
suggest
this
mr.
justice
stevens
that
if
it
did
so,
if
it
took
off
and
landed
on
an
uncontrolled
airfield
and
flipped
off
all
its
switches
and
talked
to
nobody,
if
it
was
involved
in
a
mid-air
collision
with
a
private
plane
heading
say
from
connecticut
to
new
hampshire
and
if
it
were
found
that
that
private
plane
had
the
right
of
way
and
the
helicopter
had
it
been
listening,
would
have
been
told
to
drop
down
a
thousand
feet,
the
commonwealth
would
certainly
be
in
no
position
to
say
that
the
collision
was
not
its
fault.
in
other
words,
if
it
disregards
those
federal
services,
it
does
so
at
its
peril.
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
well,
i
would
agree
with
the
former
but
not
the
latter.
there
is
no
tax
on
the
possession
of
the
aircraft.
if
it
is
simply
possessed
on
the
ground
all
year
long,
there
is
no
tax.
if
it
takes
off
once
or
if
it
takes
off
365
times
during
the
year,
it's
the
same
tax.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
absolutely
.
and
i
think
as
a
practical
matter,
although
even
if
this
helicopter
may
not
use
federal
services
on
one
trip
or
another
one,
over
the
course
of
the
year,
i
think
it
is
certainly
reasonable
to
expect
that
they
will
almost
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
that's
correct
,it
does
not.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
the
facilities
are
there.
it
is
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
which
it
may
use,
and
which
it
provided
at
federal
expense
through
the
imposition
of
this
tax
in
title
2.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
in
that
situation,
i
think
we
are
somewhat
--
we
are
not
in
the
same
position
we
are
here.
i
think,
let
me
refer
this
another
tax
that
was
passed
as
part
of
this
airway
development
act
which
imposed
an
excise
tax
on
aviation
fuels
of
so
much
per
gallon.
now,
congress
in
its
wisdom
exempted
the
states
from
payment
of
that
tax.
but
i
think
that
is
the
corollary
there
that
perhaps
shows
that
this
is
closely
tied
to
use
that
the
$25
or
the
$130
charge
is
there
on
one
time
basis,
and
it
is
there
to
defray
the
costs
of
administering
the
federal
aviation
act
and
maintaining
the
navigability
of
the
airspace.
the
aviation
fuels
charge
is
there
to
precisely
calibrate
the
payment
of
taxes
by
the
amount
of
hours
or
miles
flown.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
assume
that
the
government
would.
i
think
that
the
reason
that
was
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
that
is
up
to
the
congress
responding
to
whatever
political
forces
it
feels.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
believe
so.
we
think
that
the
theory
of
packet
co.
v.
keokuk
in
the
head
money
cases
and
clyde
mallory
lines
stand
for
the
proposition
that
user
charges
are
not
taxes
or
more
precisely
they
are
subject
to
the
same
restraints
that
the
constitution
--.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
if
it
still
could
be
considered
a
user
charge,
we
think
that
trust
fund
here
is
evidence
or
proof
that
this
is
truly
a
user
charge.
in
the
absence
of
a
trust
fund,
i
think
you
could
still
find
a
user
charge
and
in
fact
i
think
in
the
montanic
trucking
case
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
this
court
did.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
it
makes
no
difference.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
well,
if
it
was
a
user
charge,
regardless
of
what
they
call
it,
whether
they
call
personal
property
tax
or
anything
else,
if
the
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
think
that
would
be
so.
you
run
into
a
problem
of
course,
with
the
supremacy
clause.
the
traditional
genesis
of
intergovernmental
immunity
that
it
does
not
work
both
ways.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
well,
if
it
is
a
user
charge
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
think
that
would
be
actual
use
of
state
powers.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
if
it
was
asked
to
pay
a
toll
on
massachusetts
toll
booth
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
am
informed
and
we
thought
we
might
get
it,
and
including
this
area,
the
federal
military
convoys
do
pay
state
highway
tolls.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
it
is
the
policy.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
may
be
that
is
why
it
is
not
a
policy.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
think
the
question
is,
is
it
a
user
charge
;or
is
it
not?
i
think
the
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
yes
i
realize
that.
i
think
your
question
goes
to
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
is
not
entirely
a
capital
cost
but
it
is
certainly
to
the
extent
that
the
act
finances
the
building
of
airports
and
air
facilities,
to
that
extent
it
is
a
capital
cost.
the
act
is
quite
explicit
and
that
it
says
the
expenses
in
the
trust
fund
go
to
improving
and
operating
and
maintaining
as
well
as
establishing.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
it
regulates
the
navigable
air
space
of
the
united
states.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
in
terms
of
what
it
owns
in
a
proprietary
sense,
nothing.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
think,
once
you
accept
the
proposition
that
this
is
a
user
charge,
the
doctrine
of
intergovernmental
immunity
simply
need
not
be
faced.
that
was
the
rationale
of
the
court
of
appeals,
and
we
think
that
this
court
can
affirm
on
the
same
rationale,
however
if
the
court
feels
it
necessary
or
desirable
to
face
that
question,
we
think
that
it
need
go
no
further
than
to
reaffirm
the
case
of
new
york
v.
united
states,
and
we
believe
that
an
affirmance
on
that
ground
would
still
result
in
an
affirmance
of
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
still
uphold
the
tax.
the
case
of
new
york
v.
united
states
as
this
court
is
aware
was
decided
without
a
majority
of
the
court
as
such.
well,
chief
justice
stone's
opinion
can
be
read
as
the
opinion
of
the
court.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
yes
sir
it
was.
the
tax
involved
there
was
a
federal
tax
on
mineral
waters
which
new
york
sold
from
its
springs
at
saratoga.
the
state
of
new
york
contended
that
it
was
disposing
of
its
natural
resources
and
in
a
classic
case
of
exercising
its
sovereign
functions
and
this
court
did
not
disagree,
but
the
test
that
chief
justice
stone
formulated
in
that
opinion
was
whether
a
tax
even
though
non-discriminatory
?may
nevertheless
so
affect
the
state
merely
because
it
is
a
state
that
is
being
taxed
as
to
interfere
unduly
with
the
state's
performance
of
its
sovereign
functions
of
government?
chief
justice
stone,
it
should
be
added,
voted
to
sustain
the
tax
and
the
tax
was
sustained.
as
i
understand,
the
commonwealth's
case,
they
are
essentially
relying
on
this
statement
by
mr.
chief
justice
stone,
but
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
case
nor
is
there
any
claim
as
to
what
that
evidence
might
be,
as
to
how
this
tax
unduly
interferes
with
massachusetts
performance
of
its
sovereign
function.
we
think
the
reason
for
that
is
that
it
does
not
interfere
at
all.
massachusetts
in
its
complaint
which
is
taken
as
true
for
present
purposes
simply
made
no
allegation,
nor
do
i
understand
the
commonwealth
to
make
any
allegation
in
their
brief
now
that
this
tax
interferes
with
the
performance
of
their
sovereign
duties.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
yes,
mr.
justice
stevens,
that
falls.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
understood
the
commonwealth,
my
brother
mr.
o'malley
to
take
the
position
in
his
opening
statement
that
legitimate
user
fee
such
as
for
toll
road
or
river
tolls,
so
forth
are
not
within
the
scope
of
governmental
immunity
and
the
commonwealth
would
not
be
immune
from
paying
those
tolls
but
here
he
said
it's
different
because
it
is
a
tax
and
it
is
not
something
that
is
voluntarily
paid
by
commonwealth
of
massachusetts,
once
of
course,
they
decide
to
buy
a
helicopter.
i
would
infer
from
what
he
says
that
a
toll
or
tax
or
a
duty
or
levy
or
whatever
it's
labeled
of
a
dollar
per
hour
would
not
be
objectionable
to
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
or
to
take
a
more
concrete
example
that
massachusetts
would
see
no
problem
with
the
fuel
tax
of
so
many
cents
per
gallon
being
imposed
on
it
because
that
is
a
very
closely
correlated
tax,
correlating
the
amount
paid
to
use.
so,
i
think
that
given
that
view
of
the
facts
by
the
commonwealth
to
then
turn
around
and
say,
well,
this
is
levied
directly
against
the
state
and
therefore
comes
in
under
the
intergovernmental
immunities
doctrine
whatever
present
status
of
that
doctrine
may
be,
is
an
elevation
of
form
of
nicety
over
the
facts
of
the
case.
that
the
airspace
is
there,
the
facilities
are
there,
as
a
practical
matter
they
are
used.
i
think
that
can
safely
be
said.
and
this
is
nothing
more
than
the
federal
governments
seeking
too
fairly
and
equitably
charge
those
users
whether
they
be
an
individual,
or
corporation,
or
national
government
or
a
state
government
for
the
use
of
those
facilities.
saying
it
in
that
way
i
think
requires
that
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
be
affirmed.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
the
record
doesn't
show
it,
i
don't
know
it.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
the
amount
of
tax
raised
by
imposing
the
tax
on
state
governments.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
assume
it
is
small
mr.
chief
justice.
the
act
authorizes
well
over
a
billion
dollars
to
be
spent
for
the
improvements
in
title
1
but
that
of
course
is
gathered
from
all
sources
and
i
don't
know
how
that's
broken
down
in
terms
of
what
the
different
states
pay.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
have
not
mentioned
it
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
didn't
mention
it
because
i
think
it
is
not
a
part
of
this
case.
i
thank
the
court.
