justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
o'malley,
with
regard
just
to
your
first
argument,
is
it
your
position
that
even
if
it
were
a
user
fee,
in
which
the
charge
was
related
to
the
amount
of
usage
of
the
air
system
that
the
state
aircraft
did
use
that
would
still
be
invalid.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
that
is
your
position
why
don't
you
challenge
--
and
apparently
the
state
has
not
challenged
the
tax
on
airline
tickets
by
state
employees.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
o'malley
it
is
true
though,
isn't
that
this
helicopter
involved
in
this
case,
helicopter
could
take
off
from
the
roof
of
the
hospital
say,
fly
around
and
land,
never
talk
to
anybody
on
the
radio,
never
use
any
federal
facility
and
still
have
to
pay
the
tax.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
same
tax
is
there
if
it
spent
$100,
000
during
the
year
using
all
the
facility,
precisely
the
same
tax.
would
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
helicopter
could
take
off
and
land
without
talking
to
any
federal
employee,
couldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
saying
lawfully
there
is
no
legal
limit
on
the
take
off
from
uncontrolled
airport,
you
don't
have
to
talk
to
anyone?
justice
john
paul
stevens
neither
in
landing
nor
in
flying.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
can
assure
you,
i
have
done
it.
let
me
ask
you
this.
does
your
legal
position
depend
on
as
a
factual
matter,
the
plane
actually
making
use
of
any
federal
communication
facility?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
on
the
logan
airport
it
can
not
but
there
are
many
areas
on
the
state
of
massachusetts
which
are
uncontrolled
their
space
in
which
an
aircraft
can
fly
without
talking
to
anyone.
it
can
take
off
from
uncontrolled
fields
and
land
on
uncontrolled
fields.
the
tax
applies
to
those
planes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
mr.
ryan,
can
i
test
your
theory
with
another
question?
supposing
the
situation
were
reversed.
now
let's
say
the
state
of
virginia
puts
money
in
its
airports
and
supposing
it
imposed
a
$25
tax
on
every
aircraft
that
landed
at
any
one
of
the
--
that
was
based
at
any
one
of
the
airfields
in
the
state,
as
a
user
charge,
it
is
the
same
theory
as
you
have
here.
and
the
fbi
on
the
plane
that
was
flying
out
one
of
those
airplanes,
does
the
state
of
virginia
tax
united
states
for
the
ownership
of
that
plane?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
be
so,
they
did
not
have
a
trust
fund?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so
one
time
annual
measured,
suppose
if
they
measure
it
on
the
value
of
the
aircraft
instead
of
the
weight
of
the
aircraft,
could
they
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
in
other
words
the
state
of
virginia
could
impose
a
personal
property
tax
on
the
united
states?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
explained
in
the
legislative
history,
the
reason
is
to
help
pay
for
airports
and
will
only
tax
airplanes
that
land
or
based
at
virginia.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
can
call
it
a
user
charge
why
would
not
it
work
both
ways.
that's
really
what
i
was
trying
to
figure
out.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
can
be
a
user
charge,
it
is
just
the
tax
based
on
the
value
of
the
aircraft
as
long
it
just
lands
at
a
state-owned
facility
on
the
one
case
or
uses
the
federal
facility
in
the
other
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
ryan
can
i
just
ask
two
other
questions.
suppose
by
analogy,
the
united
states
decided
to
propose
the
tax
on
the
use
of
the
interstate
highway
system
that
could
charge
a
flat
sum
for
all
vehicles
including
state-owned
vehicles.
all
the
water
systems,
boats
owned
by
the
states,
i
mean,
that
same
sort
of
thing
could
be
done,
couldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
