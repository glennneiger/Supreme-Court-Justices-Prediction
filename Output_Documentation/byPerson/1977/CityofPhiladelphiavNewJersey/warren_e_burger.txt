chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
city
of
philadelphia
against
new
jersey.
mr.
moore,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
would
the
existence
of
these
companies
in
that
kind
of
business
alone
give
them
any
special
status?
suppose,
for
example,
they
instead
of
taking
it
over
to
new
jersey,
they
decided
to
haul
it
out
to
sea
a
little
distance
and
drop
it,
would
that
be
--
would
there
be
a
barrier
to
enforcing
restraints
against
that
for
environmental
purposes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
under
whose
control?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
on
the
other
hand,
i
suppose
it
might
be
reasonably
said
that
pennsylvania
wants
to
make
use
of
the
nearby
space
of
new
jersey
rather
than
using
the
much
greater
land
area
which
pennsylvania
has
because
of
the
cost.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it
is
the
comparison
of
the
size
of
the
two
states,
roughly?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
comparison?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
pennsylvania
must
be
twice
as
big
or
three
times
as
big?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you
are
saying
and
that
perhaps
it
could
be
suggested
that
philadelphia
and
other
places
in
pennsylvania
want
to
use
new
jersey’s
space
because
it
is
more
expensive
to
use
pennsylvania’s
own
space
when
there
is
a
competition
ultimately
for
the
finite
amount
of
space
available.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
putting
all
these
burdens
on
new
jersey.
how
about
the
people
who
are
importing
this
stuff
into
new
jersey?
why
can
they
not
take
some
of
these
steps?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
must
first
have
to
decide
that
it
is
true
commerce,
do
you
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
now
consuming
the
finite
amount
of
rebuttal
time
that
you
have.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
moore.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
skillman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
your
argument
is
you
do
not
want
to
take
on
pennsylvania’s
problems
in
addition
to
the
problems
new
jersey
already
has?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
us
assume
for
a
moment
that
these
alternatives
are
available,
are
they
not
equally
available
to
both
states?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
take
you
back
to
the
effort
to
analogize
the
district
of
columbia
to
a
state.
is
there
not
a
difference
in
the
unique
posture
of
the
district
of
columbia
that
congress
can
tax
all
the
people
of
the
united
states,
no
matter
what
the
cost
maybe
to
take
care
of
the
waste
disposal
problem
for
the
district
of
columbia,
but
new
jersey
cannot
tax
anybody
except
the
people
of
new
jersey
for
that
purpose?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
relevant
to
any
possible
analogy
between
the
district
of
columbia
with
its
very
limited
land
space
and
anyone
of
the
other
50
states?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
the
congress
would
have
the
power,
would
it
not,
to
go
over
to
virginia
or
maryland
and
condemn
a
large
tract
of
land
and
take
it
for
a
federal
purpose?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
new
jersey
has
no
such
power
or
pennsylvania
to
do
that
with
reference
to
another
state,
has
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
issue
is
vacant
land,
there
is
a
lot
more
vacant
land
in
pennsylvania
than
there
is
in
new
jersey,
is
there
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
might
cost
philadelphia
more
to
get
it
off
in
the
poconos
mountains
or
some
place.
they
might
run
into
a
lot
of
problems
about
that,
but
at
least
there
is
more
of
it
available
than
new
jersey
has?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
the
city
of
philadelphia
against
state
of
new
jersey
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
stewart.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
stewart.
