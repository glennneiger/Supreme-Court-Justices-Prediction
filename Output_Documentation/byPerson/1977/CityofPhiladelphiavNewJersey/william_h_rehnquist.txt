is
it
like
the
cemetery?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
say
that
a
one-acre
zoning
limitation
enacted
by
a
town
in
new
jersey
or
perhaps
a
five-acre
zoning
limitation
for
a
single
family
dwelling
was
a
hording
of
natural
resource
as
to
levy
who
wanted
to
build
on
quarter-acre
lots?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
would
you
say
that
any
state
regulation
which
required
more
space
to
be
used
or
prevented
space
to
be
used
that
an
out
of
state
developer
wanted
to
use
was
a
hording
of
a
natural
resource
and
thereby
violated
the
commerce
clause?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
let
us
assume
that
point
is
not
reached
in
answer
to
my
hypothetical
question
so
that
your
only
complaint
is
the
commerce
clause?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
that
a
state
may
not
“horde”
its
natural
resources
and
i
am
asking
you
if
a
zoning
ordinance
which
as
applied
to
someone
who
wants
to
build
houses
on
quarter-acre
lots
insists
that
the
minimum
requirement
is
a
five-acre
lot,
is
guilty
of
hording?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
as
a
matter
of
economic
factors,
philadelphia
want
to
go
to
new
jersey
and
new
jersey
companies
want
to
go
to
philadelphia
in
a
high-cost
operation
like
this?
why
would
you
not
pick
the
place
nearest
at
hand?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
does
philadelphia
not
find
places
in
pennsylvania?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
not
have
legislative
findings
in
the
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
a
certain
sense,
mr.
skillman,
if
your
opponent’s
argument
is
bought,
a
state
which
does
not
itself
have
any
large
cities
in
it,
but
which
has
neighboring
states
that
have
large
cities
on
its
borders,
it
is
going
to
be
subjected
to
a
certain
degree
of
servitude
in
that,
the
state
without
any
large
cities
cannot
under
the
commerce
clause
ban
the
disposal
of
refuse
from
other
states
without
banning
disposal
of
its
own,
whereas,
the
state
with
the
large
cities
in
it
can
simply
ban
all
disposal
of
refuse
and
force
its
own
cities
to
look
elsewhere?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
not
take
new
jersey
waste
either,
and
therefore,
they
do
not
violate
the
commerce
clause,
but
they
simply
make
philadelphia
go
elsewhere?
