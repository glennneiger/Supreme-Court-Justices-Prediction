white
mr.
moore,
could
new
jersey
constitutionally
put
in
a
statute
slowing
down
the
importation
of
waste
from
all
sources
so
that
both
new
jersey
producers
and
philadelphia
producers
would
be
equally
effective?
would
that
be
constitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
everything
you
say
about
new
jersey
is
equally
true
of
pennsylvania
in
a
larger
scale?
