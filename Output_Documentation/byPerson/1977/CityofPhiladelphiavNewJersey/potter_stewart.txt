or
incinerating
it,
is
that
not
true?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought,
mr.
skillman,
that
the
record
show
that
although
leachate
was
and
is
a
problem
with
most,
if
not
all
of
the
landfill
operations
in
new
jersey
and
elsewhere,
nonetheless
techniques
were
available
which
at
the
appropriate
cost,
could
be
applied
to
not
only
mitigate,
but
solve
this
problem?
justice
potter
stewart
i
have
read
affidavits
in
the
record
in
this
appendix,
maybe
they
were
not
introduced.
justice
potter
stewart
like
everything
else,
it
is
a
matter
of
cost?
justice
potter
stewart
there
are
sworn
affidavits
here
from
experts
saying
that
it
is
possible?
justice
potter
stewart
what
you
say
is
certainly
relevant
to
the
valid
and
legitimate
exercise
of
what
has
become
to
be
called
as
the
police
power
by
the
state
of
new
jersey,
but
that
certainly
does
not
resolve
the
commerce
question
which
is
a
matter
of
an
issue
of
constitutional
law
is
the
issue
before
us?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
skillman,
could
i
ask
you,
just
to
be
sure
i
have
your
theory.
if
you
are
correct,
i
suppose
every
state
could
have
a
similar
law
and
every
state
could
ban
the
importation
of
waste
disposal?
justice
potter
stewart
then,
what
do
you
do
with
the
problem
with
an
area
such
as
the
district
of
columbia?
i
suppose
your
answer
to
that
is
well,
it
will
just
be
terribly
expensive
to
take
some
real
estate
within
the
district
for
disposal
purposes,
but
that
is
that
localityâ€™s
problem.
is
that
the
way
you
look
at
it?
justice
potter
stewart
to
make
the
example
fair,
assume
the
district
was
just
a
sate
like
every
other
area.
say,
it
is
a
very
crowded
state,
perhaps
delaware,
rhode
island.
it
might
get
so
crowded
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
or
even
new
jersey,
that
it
would
just
be
terribly
costly
for
that
particular
state.
you
would
say
that
is
a
matter
of
indifference.
each
state
has
to
bear
its
own
costs
in
this
area
and
interstate
commerce
is
to
be
disregarded.
justice
potter
stewart
there
should
be
no
interstate
market
for
waste
disposals
is
your
basic
position.
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
protected
only
by
the
commerce
clause?
justice
potter
stewart
this
case
is
here
by
way
of
direct
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey,
mr.
justice
brennan's
old
court.
a
new
jersey
law
prohibits
the
importation
of
solid
or
liquid
waste
which
originated
or
was
collected
outside
the
territorial
limits
of
the
state.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
this
statutory
prohibition
is
valid
under
the
commerce
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution.
for
the
reasons
discussed
in
the
written
opinion
of
the
court
filed
this
morning
with
the
clerk,
we
hold
that
this
state
law
is
impermissible
under
the
commerce
clause
and
accordingly
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
new
jersey
supreme
court.
mr
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
the
chief
justice
has
joined.
