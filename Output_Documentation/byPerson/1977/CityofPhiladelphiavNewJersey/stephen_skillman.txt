mr.
stephen
skillman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
disposal
of
waste
onto
the
land.
waste
is
not
a
product
which
new
jersey
has
chosen
or
elected
to
manufacture.
rather,
it
is
what
the
name
implies.
it
is
the
useless
byproducts
of
human
existence.
if
we
could
eliminate
the
generation
of
all
waste,
we
would.
however,
we
cannot
do
that.
human
beings
in
their
day-to-day
existence
create
waste
and
so
long
as
waste
continues
to
be
created,
we
must
find
a
way
to
dispose
of
it.
the
only
generally
feasible
means
of
disposing
of
common
household
waste
and
commercial
waste
in
the
present
time
is
by
dumping
the
waste
onto
the
land.
mr.
stephen
skillman
you
can
incinerate,
your
honor.
it
is
not
done
that
much
at
the
present
time
and
one
of
the
reasons
is
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
do
that
without
creating
a
different
kind
of
environmental
problem,
i.e.
air
pollution
from
the
environmental
problems
that
are
created
with
landfills
which
i
will
get
into
in
just
a
moment.
you
also
can
dump
into
the
ocean.
again,
another
whole
set
of
environmental
problems,
so
the
prevailing
mode
of
disposal
of
household
and
commercial
waste
in
this
country
today
is
landfilling
and
not
the
exclusive
one.
there
are
some
incineration.
i
think
there
is
still
a
limited
amount
of
dumping
into
the
ocean,
but
each
one
of
those
creates
environmental
problems
and
health
risks.
i
would
like
to
briefly
go
through
what
those
environmental
and
health
risks
are
with
respect
to
landfilling.
one
of
the
primary
effects
of
landfilling
is
the
creation
of
a
leachate.
as
all
of
the
various
products
go
into
the
landfill,
water
also
comes
in
either
by
rain
or
by
tidal
flow
or
in
one
other
way
and
when
the
landfill
becomes
saturated,
it
starts
to
produce
this
highly
polluted
liquid
called
“leachate”
which
can
run
off
into
both
ground
water
and
in
the
surface
waters
and
ultimately
can
pollute
the
water
which
we
use
for
drinking.
so
it
is
a
very
substantial
environmental
danger
from
the
leachate
produced
by
landfills.
a
second
environmental
danger
from
landfills
is
the
creation
of
methane
gas.
it
is
quite
common
in
landfills
and
even
those
where
they
are
using
modern
techniques
of
landfilling
for
gases
to
get
produced
in
sufficient
concentrations
under
the
ground
for
fires
to
breakout
as
a
result
of
a
concentration
of
methane
gas.
mr.
stephen
skillman
they
run
a
full
gallon.
you
might
have
small
municipal
landfills
that
take
just
the
waste
from
an
individual
municipality
that
may
be
just
five
or
ten
acres.
mr.
stephen
skillman
yes.
mr.
stephen
skillman
it
is
common
to
all
landfills
in
the
state
of
new
jersey.
whether
or
not
there
are
landfill
locations
and
some
of
them
are
more
arid
western
states
where
it
is
possible
to
avoid
that
problem,
i
do
not
know.
but,
no
one
has
pointed
out
to
us
any
landfill
locations
in
the
state
of
new
jersey
where
this
is
not
a
problem.
mr.
stephen
skillman
the
total
number
of
landfills
in
new
jersey
presently
is
over
300
and
about,
i
think,
between
50
and
100
of
those
are
large
commercial
landfills
and
many
of
the
remainder
of
the
very
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
again,
it
runs
50-100
acres
and
it
can
vary
quite
a
bit.
mr.
stephen
skillman
well,
i
think
as
your
honor
knows,
there
had
been
historically
a
fairly
heavy
concentration
of
landfills
in
the
hackensack
meadowlands
region,
but
there
are
others
scattered
throughout
the
state,
yes.
of
course,
the
problems
are
greatest
in
the
areas
that
are
the
most
congested
areas.
mr.
stephen
skillman
that
is
not
the
only
location.
there
are
some
very
large
commercial
lands
in
the
hackensack
meadowlands
area,
but
there
are
others
in
middlesex
county
around
new
brunswick.
there
are
others
in
the
trenton
area.
the
particular
landfills
that
are
involved
in
this
case
are,
i
think,
mostly
in
the
burlington
county,
the
appellants
in
this
case.
so
they
are
not
limited
to
the
hackensack
meadowlands,
but
that
is
one
prime
location
and
it
is
the
location
that
has
probably
been
the
one
of
greatest
concern
to
environmentalists
in
the
state
of
new
jersey.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
think
it
is
only
recently
that
people
have
really
began
to
appreciate
the
extent
of
the
dangers
of
putting
garbage
into
an
area
which
is
periodically
inundated
by
the
tide.
mr.
stephen
skillman
what
are
we
going
to
do
to
the
garbage,
your
honor?
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
think
that
the
long-run
direction
is
to
try
to
go
towards
resource
recovery
programs.
mr.
stephen
skillman
as
of
right
now,
we
are
going
to
continue
to
dump
it
in
the
land
and
pay
the
environmental
price.
mr.
stephen
skillman
we
are
going
to
go
ahead
and
--
we
do
not
have
any
choice,
but
to
go
ahead
and
dump
in
the
land
the
waste
that
is
generated
within
the
state
of
new
jersey.
the
intent
of
this
legislation
is
not
to
increase
the
size
of
an
already
great
problem
by
forcing
the
state
of
new
jersey
to
not
only
accommodate
its
own
waste,
but
also
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
think
that
the
primary
problem
that
philadelphia
has
is
one
of
pennsylvania
law.
pennsylvania
law
permits
a
municipality
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania
to
enact
an
ordinance
which
will
prohibit
the
disposal
in
that
municipality
of
waste
originating
in
other
municipalities.
the
municipalities
that
immediately
surround
philadelphia
have
enacted
ordinances
which
prohibit
the
disposal
in
those
municipalities
of
waste
originating
in
philadelphia.
so
the
answer
as
to
what
philadelphia
is
going
to
do,
what
they
should
do,
they
should
go
to
the
pennsylvania
legislature
and
get
the
pennsylvania
legislature
to
enact
legislation
that
has
the
practical
effect
of
overriding
these
ordinances.
mr.
stephen
skillman
we
have
a
complaint
against
it
in
the
sense
that
we
do
pay
a
price.
we
do
have
these
environmental
problems,
but
absent
another
feasible
alternative,
that
is
where
we
are
going
to
go
ahead
and
take
care
of
the
disposal.
mr.
stephen
skillman
we
do
not
have
any
that
are
practically
feasible
on
a
wide
scale
price.
mr.
stephen
skillman
precisely,
your
honor.
it
is
a
matter
of
increasing
the
magnitude
of
something
that
is
a
problem
in
any
event.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
do
not
think
the
record
shows
that,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
skillman
there
is
some
debate
among
sanitary
engineers
as
to
whether
or
not
it
is
possible
to
construct
a
sanitary
landfill
where
you
will
reduce
to
a
great
minimum
or
eliminate
problems
of
leachate
disposal.
mr.
stephen
skillman
well,
it
is
a
matter
of
cost
and
it
is
a
matter
of
academic
dispute
as
to
whether
it
is
possible
also.
mr.
stephen
skillman
there
are
experts
saying
that
it
is
possible.
there
are
some
experts
who
think
it
is
not
possible.
mr.
stephen
skillman
the
finding
of
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
is
that
landfills
cost
serious
environmental
problems.
mr.
stephen
skillman
both
states
can
try,
that
is
right.
whatever
the
techniques
are
to
mitigate
environmental
harms
and
there
are
techniques
to
mitigate
those
harms,
there
is
no
question.
as
a
matter
of
degree,
they
are
equally
available
whether
the
landfill
is
located
on
the
pennsylvania
side
of
the
delaware
river
or
the
new
jersey
side
of
the
river.
mr.
stephen
skillman
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
skillman
both
of
the
lower
courts
found
this
law
to
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
was
getting
there.
i
think
they
both
found
it
unconstitutional
on
the
discrimination
theory
and
did
not
get
into
that
kind
of
a
factual
finding.
such
a
factual
finding
was
made
based
upon
the
record
by
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey,
also
made
by
the
new
jersey
legislature
that
landfills
cause
environmental
harm.
you
have
findings
by
both
the
new
jersey
legislature
and
by
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
generally
on
the
finding
that
landfills
pose
serious
environmental
and
health
dangers.
i
would
add
that
those
findings
are
supported
by
numerous
affidavits
in
the
record
and
they
are
supported
by
scholarly
literature.
they
are
supported
by
reports
that
have
been
put
up
on
a
federal
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
no.
i
cannot
say
that
there
was
a
specific
finding
on
the
debate
in
a
scientific
community,
whether
it
is
possible
to
construct
the
ideal
landfill
that
eliminates
leachate.
but
i
think
that
under
the
existing
cases,
it
is
clear
that
the
mere
possibility
that
a
landfill
maybe
able
to
be
constructed
somewhere
someday
where
these
problems
will
be
eliminated,
does
not
prevent
the
new
jersey
legislature
from
taking
other
constructive
steps
to
mitigate
an
existing
harm
in
light
of
the
fact
that
every
existing
landfill,
everyone
can
point
out,
does
pose
these
problems
and
whether
or
not
it
is
possible
to
construct
that
ideal
landfill
is
a
subject
of
much
debate.
mr.
stephen
skillman
it
does
not
resolve
it,
your
honor,
but
it
goes
very
much
to
the
commerce
clause
question.
this
court
has
recognized,
in
its
most
recent
commerce
clause
decision
in
the
raymond
transportation
co.
case,
that
the
key
consideration
in
terms
of
commerce
or
a
key
consideration
is
the
nature
of
the
state
regulatory
concern.
so
in
that
sense,
it
goes
very
directly
to
the
commerce
clause
point.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
think
it
is
a
practical
matter
almost
every
state
does,
in
one
way
or
another.
mr.
stephen
skillman
well,
i
would
think
that
if
such
a
problem
was
to
exist
in
the
district
and
there
were
not
another
feasible
means
of
resolving
that
problem,
we
have
little
doubt
that
congress
would
address
itself
to
the
problem.
mr.
stephen
skillman
new
jersey?[laughter]
mr.
stephen
skillman
no.
mr.
stephen
skillman
yes,
it
is
our
position
that
this
is
not
an
area
that
is
within
the
free
trade,
free
market
principles
of
the
commerce
clause
due
to
the
environmental
harms.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
do
not
have
any
doubt,
your
honor,
but
congress
has
the
power
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
under
the
commerce
clause
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
that
is
correct
and
in
fact
it
has
done
so.
it
is
enacted
comprehensive
legislation,
the
resource
recovering
and
conservation
act
which
was
enacted
13
days
before.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
am
conceding
that
for
purposes
of
the
exercise
of
power
by
congress,
that
it
would
constitute
commerce.
mr.
stephen
skillman
the
sale
of
space
in
new
jersey
for
landfills.
mr.
stephen
skillman
excuse
me?
mr.
stephen
skillman
it
would
affect
congress
sufficiently
to
provide
a
foundation.
mr.
stephen
skillman
similarly
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
surely.
but
this
court
has
recognized
power
of
congress
to
deal
with
subjects
such
as
prostitution,
kidnapping
in
terms
of
congress’
power
under
the
commerce
clause.
the
mere
fact
that
congress
has
the
power
to
deal
with
the
subject
matter
under
the
commerce
clause
does
not
mean
that
the
commerce
clause,
by
its
own
force,
prevents
a
state
from
dealing
with
that
same
subject
matter
in
the
fashion
that
new
jersey
has
sought.
mr.
stephen
skillman
congress
has
not
spoken
directly
to
this
type
of
statute,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
think
it
has
come
close
to
saying
that
with
respect
to
state
laws
generally.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
think
that
congress’
findings
and
approach
in
the
resource
conservation
and
recovery
act
at
least
supports
the
conclusion
that
the
new
jersey
legislation
is
not
prohibited
by
the
commerce
clause.
we
would
not
rely
on
that
alone,
but
it
certainly
seems
to
be
moving
in
the
same
direction,
i.e.
of
recognizing
that
problems
of
solid
waste
disposal
and
management
are
essentially
local
problems
to
be
dealt
within
the
state
and
at
local
level.
mr.
stephen
skillman
that
is
precisely
my
point,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
skillman
that
is
true,
but
i
do
not
think
it
is
basic
to
the
reasons
that
new
jersey
has
enacted
the
statute.
new
jersey’s
basic
reasons
for
enactment
of
the
statute
are
environmental.
mr.
stephen
skillman
well,
i
think
that
the
district
is
sui
generis
in
great
many
respects,
your
honor,
that,
being
only
one
of
them,
but
the
fact
remains
that
the
reason,
the
basis
of
enactment
of
this
legislation
by
the
state
of
new
jersey
was
not
one
having
to
do
with
cost.
it
was
one
having
to
do
with
environmental
harm.
in
agreeing
with
your
honor,
i
do
not
want
to
indicate
anything
to
the
contrary
on
that
point.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
have
no
doubt.
mr.
stephen
skillman
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
stephen
skillman
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
skillman
yes.
mr.
stephen
skillman
yes,
the
resource
conservation
and
recovery
act
basically
leaves
solid
waste
disposal
planning
management
to
the
states.
the
one
major
exception
to
that
is
in
the
area
of
hazardous
wastes
and
in
that
area,
the
federal
government
has
taken,
i
do
not
know
where
to
characterize
it
as
a
preemptive
posture,
but
certainly
a
very
active
position.
mr.
stephen
skillman
we
have
no
problem
with
hazardous
wastes.
mr.
stephen
skillman
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
stephen
skillman
our
implementing
the
regulations
which
are
at
page
81
of
the
appendix,
section
d
specifically
excludes
hazardous
wastes
which
are
disposed
of
through
a
disposal
facility
other
than
by
disposal
on
or
in
the
land.
new
jersey,
presently,
does
not
register
any
landfill
for
the
disposal
of
hazardous
wastes
in
the
land.
the
only
circumstances
under
which
we
will
presently
register
a
facility
for
the
disposal
of
hazardous
wastes
is
by
processing
or
a
treatment
facility.
a
processing
or
a
treatment
facility
does
not
fall
within
the
statute
as
qualified
or
modified
by
the
implementing
regulations
on
page
81
of
the
appendix.
mr.
stephen
skillman
there
is
no
conflict
at
the
present
time
with
respect
to
hazardous
waste
and
also
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
it
also
is
not
here
for
another
reason.
there
is
no
indication
in
this
record
that
the
city
of
philadelphia
is
generating
hazardous
waste.
there
is
no
indication
that
any
of
the
appellant
landfills
receive
hazardous
wastes.
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
not
hazardous
wastes.
we
are
talking
about
common
household
waste.
so
whatever
possible
problems
there
maybe
of
collision
between
the
hazardous
waste
provisions
of
the
new
federal
act
and
a
legislation
similar
to
new
jersey
there
is
just
not
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
are
properly
presented
in
this
case.
mr.
stephen
skillman
no,
your
honor.
i
think
you
asked
me
the
same
question
last
time.
mr.
stephen
skillman
it
is
the
same.
we
do
not
take
that
position.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
think
that
would
be
a
much
more
difficult
kind
of
a
situation.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
think
that
that
case
would
come
much
closer
to
the
natural
resource
cases
because
what
you
will
be
talking
about
there
is
not
the
simple
disposal
of
waste,
but
rather
the
manufacture
of
a
product
in
which
there
is
a
recognized
and
established
national
market.
there
are
also
elements
of
particular
states
being
in
a
better
position
than
others
to
produce
that
particular
product.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
do
not
agree
that
some
states
can
dispose
of
the
waste
more
cheaply
than
others
for
any
reasons
other
than
the
legal
situation
in
pennsylvania
that
i
alluded
to
before
which
is
certainly
not
the
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
it
may,
although
i
do
not
think
that
could
be
shown.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
do
not
think
that
that
point
could
be
established
in
the
philadelphia
area,
that
the
land
is
cheaper
on
the
jersey
side
than
it
is
on
the
pennsylvania
side.
mr.
stephen
skillman
in
the
entire
state,
there
is
and
in
terms
of
areas
that
are
sufficiently
proximate
to
philadelphia,
i
do
not
know
if
there
is
more,
but
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
less.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
think
that
for
the
state
as
a
whole
there
certainly
is
more
of
it.
i
do
not
want
to
say
that
within
the
proximate
distance
of
philadelphia
there
is.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
think
that
the
topic
is
alluded
to
in
one
affidavit,
your
honor,
but
the
record
is
pretty
scant
on
it.
mr.
stephen
skillman
it
is
pretty
scant.
the
record
is
not
good
on
that
particular
point.
mr.
stephen
skillman
we
do
not
have
any
cheap
land
in
new
jersey,
your
honor.
it
is
all
pretty
expensive.
mr.
stephen
skillman
that,
as
a
practical
matter,
is
the
situation
we
have
today.
pennsylvania,
as
i
mentioned
before,
the
surrounding
communities
have
ordinances
that
say
“we
do
not
want
philadelphia
waste.”
mr.
stephen
skillman
that
is
correct.
those
particular
municipalities
take
only
their
own.
they
will
not
take
either
philadelphia
or
new
jersey.
i
think
that
the
case
that
really
comes
closest
to
this
case
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
we
have
large
sprawling
municipalities
in
our
rural
areas.
i
do
not
think
we
have
such
a
thing
as
an
area
that
is
not
part
of
the
municipality
and
subject
to
the
ordinances
of
a
municipality.
mr.
stephen
skillman
well,
if
not
the
whole
state,
at
least
what
is
the
prime
area
which
is
those
communities
that
are
immediately
surrounding
philadelphia.
i
cannot
speak
for
the
whole
state.
mr.
stephen
skillman
yes.
mr.
stephen
skillman
no,
i
think
that
the
main
variable
is
hauling
distance
from
point
of
origin
to
point
of
disposal.
you
are
talking
about
tremendous
volume
when
you
are
talking
about
ordinary
household
waste.
it
has
to
be
within
some
reasonable
hauling
distance
whether
it
is
60
miles,
70,
or
100
miles.
it
cannot
be
250
miles
away
when
it
is
that
kind
of
waste.
when
it
is
more
complicated
and
hazardous
waste
that
is
in
smaller
quantities
then
we
can
have
disposal
half-way
across
the
country,
for
example,
radioactive
waste.
i
think
the
case
that
comes
closest
to
this
case
in
terms
of
the
commerce
clause
issues
is
the
case
of
clayson
v.
the
state
of
indiana
which
the
court
decided
in
1939.
the
court
in
that
case
upheld
an
indiana
statute
which
in
practical
effect,
prohibited
the
interstate
transportation
of
animal
carcasses
not
slaughtered
for
food.
now,
we
would
submit
that
there
is
no
significant
difference
in
commerce
clause
terms
between
the
disposal
of
dead
animals
and
the
disposal
of
waste.
the
clayson
case,
therefore,
provides
very
direct
and
very
strong
support
for
the
position
of
the
state
of
new
jersey
that
its
prohibition
upon
the
disposal
within
new
jersey
of
waste
originating
out
of
state
is
consistent
with
the
commerce
clause.
thank
you.
