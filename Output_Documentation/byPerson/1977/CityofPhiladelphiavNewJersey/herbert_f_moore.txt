mr.
herbert
f.
moore
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
back
on
a
remand.
we
were
here
about
a
year
ago,
i
guess.
the
case
concerns
the
constitutionality
of
a
new
jersey
statute
that
is
known
as
public
law
1973,
chapter
363.
we
are
weighing
this
statute
against
the
--
its
validity
under
the
commerce
clause
as
well
as
under
the
supremacy
clause.
i
will
try
to
divide
my
time
as
equally
as
possible
so
i
can
cover
both
of
the
very
important
subjects
and
would
like
to
reserve
five
minutes
also
for
rebuttal.
the
statute
in
new
jersey
bans
the
disposal
of
solid
waste
that
originated
out
of
new
jersey
in
new
jersey,
that
is
the
first
section
of
the
statute,
the
second
section
is
also
a
very
small
paragraph
and
that
bans
the
transportation
of
solid
waste
from
--
that
originated
out
of
new
jersey
into
and
through
new
jersey.
now,
the
first
question,
of
course,
that
we
have
to
face
with
in
considering
the
commerce
clause
situation
is,
is
the
subject
matter
and
the
activity
legitimate
in
interstate
commerce
so
that
the
commerce
clause
would
even
apply?
here,
we
are
dealing
with
a
subject
matter
that
is
very
broad
by
definition
of
the
new
jersey
statute.
it
covers
every
type
of
conceivable
waste,
both
solid
and
liquid.
we
should
not
fix
in
our
minds
rubbish
or
garbage
as
such
as
being
the
sole
object
of
the
statute
because
it
is
not.
this
covers
automobile
hulks
which
this
court
recognized
in
the
hughes
v.
alexandria
motors
case
not
so
long
ago
as
being
a
legitimate
item
in
interstate
commerce,
it
includes
demolition
material.
it
includes
the
scraps
from
industry
and
commerce
and
hotels
and
restaurants,
as
well,
of
course,
residential
scraps.
then,
in
addition
to
the
subject
matter
which
we
contend
is
legitimate
because
there
are
very
--
there
are
two
industries
that
depend
upon
this
subject
matter
for
their
economic
survival.
one
is
the
collection
industry
or
the
transporters
of
this
waste
and
the
other
is
the
disposers
of
the
waste
which
are
basically
in
new
jersey,
the
solid
waste
landfill,
sanitary
landfill
operators.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
no,
i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor,
because
we
are
not
arguing
here
that
new
jersey
does
not
have
the
right
to
deal
evenhandedly
in
protecting
its
environment
and
the
health
that
they
definitely
do.
the
question
is,
are
they
dealing
in
an
evenhanded
non-discriminatory
fashion
in
doing
this?
the
state
has
admitted
that
there
is
no
qualitative
difference
between
waste
originating
in
another
state
and
waste
originating
in
new
jersey
and
as
i
develop
my
argument,
i
will
point
out
how
there
is
actually
this
is
a
facade,
there
is
no
environmental
harm.
there
is
no
degradation
to
the
environment
to
a
properly
regulated
and
operated
sanitary
landfill
and
that
has
been
recognized
by
the
congress
as
well
in
new
jersey.
and
so
i
do
not
believe
that
it
detracts
in
any
way
the
fact
that
the
item
in
commerce
may
be
of
value
to
only
a
very
few
people
and
anyway
detracts
from
its
legitimacy
as
an
item
of
commerce.
now,
what
is
it
that
the
disposers,
the
sanitary
landfill
operators,
do?
what
function
do
they
perform?
they
are
selling
something.
they
are
selling
really
a
product
in
this
sense.
they
are
selling
space
in
a
sanitary
landfill
for
the
permanent
interment
of
solid
waste.
it
is
very
much
similar
to
a
warehouseman
selling
space
on
a
short-term
basis.
he
is
not
particularly
concerned
with
the
intrinsic
value
of
the
item
that
he
rents
space
for.
and
likewise,
the
sanitary
landfill
operator,
other
than
the
requirements
of
environmental
standards
is
not
concerned
with
the
intrinsic
worth
of
the
particular
item
going
into
his
landfill,
but
he
is
performing
a
function
of
selling
something
and
he
is
selling
space.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
yes,
i
was
going
to
mention
that
and
that
is
exactly
what
it
is
like.
we
could
imagine
the
situation,
justice
rehnquist,
of
new
york
city
which
has
been
running
out
of
cemetery
space
as
you
all
know,
anybody
who
has
driven
through
there
is
well-aware
of
that
and
new
jersey
--
new
york
put
a
ban
that
dead
bodies
could
not
be
moved
in
unless
they
died
as
residents
of
the
state
of
new
york,
i
think,
i
myself,
i
would
recognize
that
as
being
rather
ludicrous,
but
that
is
the
exact
type
of
thing.
the
cemetery
sells
permanent
and
termite
space
and
that
is
what
the
sanitary
landfill
does.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
well,
in
new
jersey,
it
is
so
strictly
regulated
that
nobody
can
have
land
filled
unless
they
have
registered
with
the
state
of
new
jersey
and
filed
an
engineering
design.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
and
complied
with
the
laws
and
obtained
a
registration
statement.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
yes.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
yes,
the
environmental
controls
are
extremely
strict
in
new
jersey.
so
just
cannot,
if
you
have
a
hole
in
your
backyard
and
decide
you
want
it
filled.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
that
is
correct
or
he
could
be
lessee,
i
mean,
that
--
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
that
is
correct.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
that
is
right.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
no,
you
pay
him.
it
is
a
very
large
industry
in
new
jersey
and
the
environmental
controls
that
the
state
exacts
are
extremely
high
and
extremely
expensive
to
install
and
that
in
its
self
supports
a
lot
of
peripheral
industries
that
supply
the
environmental
machines,
mechanics,
and
things
like
that,
a
tremendous,
heavily
compacting
units
and
bulldozers,
etcetera,
that
go
into
operating
of
a
sanitary
landfill.
now,
the
federal
courts
in
united
states
v.
pennsylvania
refuse
haulers
has
recognized
for
the
purposes
of
the
sherman
anti-trust
act,
transportation
or
disposal
--
transportation
and
disposal
of
waste
to
be
a
legitimate
subject
of
interstate
commerce.
the
congress
in
the
house
report
on
the
resource
conservation
and
recovery
act,
that
is
report
number
94,
1491,
at
several
sections
in
their
committee
report,
but
i
will
just
read
one
of
them,
it
is
on
page
9,
states
“most
of
our
discarded
materials
have,
at
some
time,
entered
the
flow
of
interstate
commerce,
if
not
as
waste
itself
then
in
the
form
of
products
which
will,
at
some
future
time,
constitute
waste.”
the
fact
that
waste
itself
is
an
interstate
and
inter-municipal,
congress
has
raised
a
number
of
problems.
several
jurisdictions
including
some
states
have
attempted
to
prohibit
the
importation
of
waste.
so
it
has
been
recognized
by
congress,
it
has
been
recognized
by
the
federal
courts
and
it
is
recognized
by
new
jersey
that
the
transportation
and
disposal
are
legitimate
businesses.
they
are
engaged
in
intrastate
commerce
in
new
jersey.
they
are
public
utilities
in
new
jersey,
the
collectors
and
the
disposers.
now,
under
the
commerce
clause,
of
course,
the
test
as
to
whether
a
state
statute
can
legitimately
co-exist
in
this
field
and
regulate
commerce,
there
has
to
meet
certain
tests
and
standards
which
this
court
has
developed
over
the
years
that
are
recited
in
pike
v.
bruce
church
and
many
of
the
others,
the
great
atlantic
&
pacific
tea
co.
v.
co-trail
and
all
the
way
down
and
basically,
it
is
that
the
state
statute
must
deal
in
an
evenhanded
non-discriminatory
manner.
it
must
serve
a
legitimate
local
purpose
and
not
be
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce
or
at
least
it
must
not
be
an
excessive
burden,
if
it
turns
out
to
be
somewhat
of
a
burden
then
of
course
we
go
into
the
balancing
of
the
national
interest
against
the
local
interest.
the
new
jersey
statute
discriminates,
in
that
new
jersey
says,
and
they
have
stated
this,
the
acting
governor
when
the
bill
was
enacted
made
the
statement,
that
we
want
to
preserve
this
as
a
natural
resource,
meaning
the
sanitary
landfills,
for
the
benefit
of
the
residents
of
the
state
of
new
jersey.
they
are,
in
effect
hording
a
resource.
it
is
very
much
like
the
natural
gas
cases
in
which
that
was
attempted
as
a
conservation
measure
by
those
states
to
horde
the
natural
gas
for
the
benefit
of
the
citizens
of
those
states
and
this
court
struck
that
down
--
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
it
could
be,
i
think,
stretched
into
that
sense,
yes,
but
in
new
jersey,
the
sanitary
landfill
locations
are
also
controlled
by
local
zoning.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
you
get
to
the
point
of
are
you
taking
private
property
from
someone?
remember,
these
are
not,
the
fact
that
they
are
public
utilities,
they
are
privately
owned.
if
they
are
not
operated
by
the
state
and
very
rarely
by
municipalities
and
very
rarely
by
counties,
the
bulk
of
the
landfills
of
new
jersey
are
privately
owned.
you
get
to
a
point
to
whether
hording
or
reserving
or
hording
a
natural
resource
becomes
a
taking.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
well,
i
do
not
quite
get
your
question,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
no,
i
do
not
think
that
is
guilty
of
hording
at
all
because
you
have
the
due
process
clause
coming
in
to
protect
that
type
of
situation.
as
long
as
the
regulation
is
reasonable
and
deals
with
the
subject
matter
in
an
evenhanded
fashion
and
is
not
arbitrary
or
capricious,
then
it
is
not
a
hording
type
of
limitation.
also,
this
new
jersey
statute
in
discrimination,
it
says
to
the
operators
of
landfills
in
new
jersey,
it
says
“you
may
sell
your
space
in
an
unlimited
way
to
anybody
in
new
jersey
whose
waste
originated
in
new
jersey,
but
you
cannot
sell
any
space
whatsoever
to
someone
that
is
a
business
outside
of
the
state
of
new
jersey
whose
waste
originates
outside
of
the
state
of
new
jersey”
and
i
think
that
is
a
very
blatant
example
of
the
discrimination.
noe,
the
health
and
environment
aspects,
the
findings
of
the
new
jersey
legislature
at
the
beginning
of
the
statute
indicates
that
they
are
leaning
on
health
and
environment
to
justify
this
encouraging
of
the
commerce
clause
by
the
state
of
new
jersey
and
just
briefly,
the
state
itself,
grant
walton,
when
he
was
director
of
the
division
of
environmental
quality
of
the
department
of
environmental
protection
of
the
state
of
new
jersey,
in
a
published
talk
that
he
gave
which
is
also
in
our
brief
on
page
9,
he
stated
that
the
health
hazard,
water
and
air
pollution,
methane
gas
problems
commonly
associated
with
landfills
can
be
eliminated
through
proper
design
and
operation
of
the
facility,
properly
done,
abandoned
surface
mines
become
parks,
playgrounds,
and
golf
courses.
this
is
the
head
of
that
department
in
new
jersey
who,
himself,
recognized
that
new
jersey
standards
were
sufficiently
high
that
there
was
no
threat
to
the
environment,
no
threat
to
the
health
of
the
public
in
the
operation
of
the
sanitary
landfill.
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
in
its
opinion
in
this
case
gave
judicial
notice
to
the
new
jersey
solid
waste
management
plan
and
that
plan
states
that
a
there
is
no
technological
reason
why
we
cannot
dispose
of
solid
waste
with
a
minimum
of
environmental
harm.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
under
the
state’s
control,
absolutely
under
the
state’s
control.
and
that
went
on
to
say
that
the
regulations
in
new
jersey
with
which
to
regulate
and
ensure
a
nuisance-free
operation
in
disposal
site
in
conformance
with
good
practices
and
health
standards.
interestingly,
the
solid
waste
management
act,
if
i
may
just
pause
here
for
a
moment,
the
act
that
we
are
weighing
here
is
called
the
waste
control
act
and
that
is
just
a
prohibitory
piece
of
legislation.
new
jersey
also
has
another
act
called
the
solid
waste
management
act
which
is
not
before
this
court,
but
that
is
the
piece
of
legislation
that
is
very
broad
and
very
pervasive
and
it
has
to
do
with
the
regulation
of
sanitary
landfills
and
any
type
of
waste
disposal
and
transportation.
when
that
statute
was
originally
enacted
around
1970,
they
used
the
word
“crisis”
and
they
said
new
jersey
was
facing
the
crisis
because
of
the
manner
in
which
landfills
were
being
operated.
when
they
amended
that
statute
here
about
a
year
ago,
they
left
the
word
“crisis”
out.
so
apparently,
the
new
jersey
legislature
itself
does
not
recognize
today
that
there
is
a
crisis
as
there
was
several
years
ago,
at
least
they
thought
there
was
at
that
time.
now,
the
resource
conservation
and
recovery
act,
again
in
the
committee
report,
to
start
with,
has
recognized
that
disposal
of
solid
waste
at
a
sanitary
landfill
is
not
a
threat
to
the
environment
or
the
health.
it
stated
that
the
legislative
standard,
this
is
on
page
37
of
the
report,
the
legislative
for
the
administrator
to
determine
the
sanitary
landfill
is
a
disposal
site
of
which
there
is
no
reasonable
chance
of
adverse
effects
on
health
and
the
environment
from
the
disposal
of
the
discarded
materials.
this,
in
the
definition,
in
42
u.s.c.
6944
of
the
resource
conservation
and
recovery
act,
the
congress
has
stated
in
defining
a
sanitary
landfill
that
there
is
no
reasonable
probability
of
adverse
affect
on
health
and
environment
from
disposal
of
solitary
waste
at
such
a
facility,
meaning
a
sanitary
landfill.
now,
i
notice
in
reading
a
case
that
was
decided
here
last
week,
ray
v.
atlantic
richfield,
an
interesting
comparison
there.
there,
the
court
said,
in
dealing
with
the
oil
tankers
in
puget
sound
“the
supremacy
clause
dictates
that
the
federal
judge,
that
a
vessel
is
safe
to
navigate
us
waters
prevails
over
a
contrary
state
judgment.”
now,
in
the
resource
conservation
and
recovery
act,
there
is
a
federal
judgment.
the
federal
judgment
is
that
these
landfills
can
be
operated
safely,
no
threat
to
the
environment
or
the
public
health.
now,
it
seems
to
me
with
that
same
line
of
reasoning
then
it
must
follow
that
there
is
no
reasonable
probability
of
adverse
effect
on
the
public
health
and
this
must
prevail,
this
over
a
contrary
state
judgment.
now,
the
local
interest
that
is
being
served,
i
believe
we
must
discount
health
and
environment
because
i
think
it
even
though
we,
let
me
just
stop
for
a
moment,
we
all
recognize
that
there
are
problems
associated
with
the
improper
handling
and
treatment
and
disposal
of
solid
waste.
there
is
no
question
about
that
and
we
have
gone
into
that
great
detail
in
our
briefs.
these
problems
are
absolutely
controllable
as
has
been
recognized
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
it
has
been
recognized
by
the
department
of
environmental
protection
actually
of
the
state
of
new
jersey.
so
the
local
benefit
really
is
an
economic
benefit.
this
has
been
stated
by
when
acting
governor
beatleson
signed
this
first
statute
into
law,
governor
keyheal
was
a
white,
he
made
a
public
statement
that
this
is
going
to
preserve
for
new
jersey
residence,
these
landfill
areas
for
their
use
because
there
is
tremendous
costs
involved
in
hauling
waste
for
long-distances
and
that
really
is
what
it
boils
down
to.
new
jersey
wants
to
gain
the
advantage
of
having
these
sanitary
landfills
kept
in
new
jersey
only
for
their
use
so
that
industry
and
private
people
will
not
be
subjected
to
the
expenses
of
hauling
longer
distances.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
it
would
be
an
economic
comparison.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
that
is
right.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
i
guess
pennsylvania
--
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
at
least.
pennsylvania
and
of
course
new
york
is
the
same
thing.
it
is
an
economic
situation.
philadelphia
is
facing
today
a
tremendous
disaster
should
new
jersey
statute
become
operative.
they
just
have
not
been
able
to
develop
a
location
at
which
it
is
economically
feasible
and
socially
feasible
to
transport
this
waste
and
in
the
large
and
huge
quantities
and
volumes
that
is
generated
there.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
this
same
thing,
mr.
chief
justice
is
happening
in
new
jersey
today
with
large
segments
of
the
chemical
industry.
there
is
no
place
in
the
new
jersey
for
this
industry
to
dispose
of
its
solid
waste.
we
have
several
affidavits
from
the
leading
companies
that
are
household
words
in
the
united
states
that
they
must
transport
their
waste
out
of
new
jersey
and
into
pennsylvania.
if
the
statute
were
ever
to
become
operative,
as
we
know,
pennsylvania
has
a
retaliatory
piece
of
legislation
and
new
jersey
would
be
forever
barred
from
disposing
of
its
waste.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
no,
that
is
pretty
much
closed
up.
that
used
to
be.
i
think
what
gave
rise
really
to
a
lot
of
this,
because
that
was
really
a
mess
up
there
for
many,
many
years.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
new
jersey
does
not
go
to
philadelphia.
they
go
to
other
sections
in
pennsylvania,
the
northwest
boarder
of
new
jersey.
they
are
not
going
into
philadelphia.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
the
problems
attending
that
are
that
they
are
trying
to
develop
a
railroad
project
which
has
received
a
lot
in
the
newspaper
notoriety
to
fill
the
strip
mines
in
western
pennsylvania
and
there
is
a
lot
of
technological
problems
in
that
operation
which
they
are
trying
to
work
out.
we
have
affidavits
that
explain
all
that,
but
the
configuration
of
philadelphia,
if
you
look
on
a
map
as
such,
that
the
west
of
philadelphia
is
heavily
populated.
you
have
tremendous
traffic
problems
in
moving
any
type
of
vehicle.
new
jersey,
right
across
the
river
and
their
several
bridges,
is
relatively
farmland
and
rural
and
it
has
always
been
traditionally
a
natural
waste
shed
for
the
delaware
valley
area
and
new
jersey
and
philadelphia.
incidentally,
this
morning,
to
give
you
an
example
what
you
are
talking
about.
a
very
interesting
thing
happened
on
the
way
to
court.
we
were
in
traffic
and
in
front
of
us
was
stalled
a
garbage
truck
and
we
were
held
up
for
a
while
and
a
thought
occurred
to
me
and
it
brought
back
to
mind
a
conversation
i
had
at
the
epa
a
while
back
when
we
were
discussing
the
statute
and
there
is
no
landfills
in
the
district
of
columbia.
the
district
of
columbia
depends
entirely
upon
virginia
and
it
depends
upon
the
state
of
maryland.
now,
what
would
happen
if
maryland
or
virginia
enacted
a
statute
like
new
jersey?
you
would
be
over
this
roof
in
solid
waste
in
the
district
of
columbia.
i
want
to
just
close
quickly
so
i
can
pass
a
little
bit
on
to
the
other
aspect
of
the
supremacy
clause
because
i
see
my
time
is
getting
short
here.
there
are
many
non-discriminatory
alternatives
that
new
jersey
has
available
to
it
to
accomplish,
if
we
say
the
legitimate
local
purpose
is
the
preservation
of
land,
a
natural
resource.
there
are
many
non-discriminatory
alternatives,
none
of
which
they
have
ever
mentioned.
they
could
require,
by
legislation,
heavier
and
improved
compactor
equipment
to
reduce
the
volume
of
waste.
they
could
require
all
sanitary
landfills
to
install
shredding
equipment,
which
shreds
the
waste
so
that
it
could
be
compacted
and
reduce
the
volume.
they
could
enact
evenhanded
ban
on
non-returnable
beverages.
they
could
have
state
subsidies
encouraging
recycling
much
like
hughes
in
maryland
did.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
it
is
new
jersey
that
wants
to
ban
it.
as
i
understand
the
commerce
clause,
new
jersey
must
deal
in
an
evenhanded
fashion
in
accomplishing
this.
now,
i
suppose
the
state
of
virginia
in
hughes
could
have
done
the
same
thing.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
yes,
sir.
that
is
why
i
pointed
out
what
was
said
by
congress,
by
the
state
of
new
jersey
in
recognizing
it
as
commerce,
by
the
auto
hulk
situation
which
is
a
part
of
solid
waste
under
definition
in
new
jersey.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
if
they
did
it
in
an
evenhanded
fashion,
i
would
say
that
it
would
be.
it
is
interesting
to
note
also
that
new
jersey
talks
about
running
out
of
landfill
space.
new
jersey
to
this
day,
and
we
have
affidavits
to
this
affect
and
that
never
ever
have
been
countered,
has
yet
to
this
day
made
a
survey
of
the
state
of
new
jersey
to
determine
what
type
of
acreage
is
available
to
it
and
to
the
users
for
solid
waste
disposal.
new
jersey
has
hundreds
and
hundreds,
and
i
guess
thousands
of
acres
of
abandoned
clay
minds.
it
used
to
be
the
clay
center,
the
ceramic
center,
trent
used
to
be
for
years
and
the
reason
is
because
of
natural
clay
deposits.
abandoned
sand
and
gravel
pits
all
throughout
the
state.
they
make
perfect
sanitary
landfills
for
land
reclamation
purposes
to
restore
land
for
use
by
the
public.
new
jersey
has
never,
to
this
day,
made
such
a
survey
whatsoever.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
the
finding
is
that
they
are
running
out
of
landfill
space,
meaning
the
existing
landfills,
it
is
true.
every
time
you
put
something
in
a
landfill,
you
are
running
out
of
that
particular
landfill
space,
but
how
can
you
have
a
crisis
of
a
lack
of
land
if
you
do
not
even
know
how
much
is
available?
you
cannot.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
and
of
every
state
in
the
country,
that
is
true.
we
find
that
this
pertains
to
any
type
of
an
economic
enterprise.
new
jersey
is
a
highly
industrialized
state.
look
at
the
thousands
and
millions
of
cans
of
campbell
soup
that
are
sent
to
pennsylvania
from
new
jersey
everyday
and
become
waste
in
pennsylvania.
new
jersey
does
not
want
to
let
the
very
waste
they
created
come
back
into
new
jersey.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
yes,
sir.
in
hunt
v.
washington
apple
commission,
which
is
another
very
recent
case,
this
court
stated
that
--
and
in
that
particular
case
they
said
that
the
discrimination
was
facially
neutral.
i
submit
in
this
case
the
discrimination
is
quite
clear
and
abundant
and
blatant.
they
said
that
where
there
is
a
clear
discrimination
and
the
court
ultimately
found
that
there
was
in
that
case
a
clear
discrimination,
the
burden
falls
on
the
state
to
justify.
in
that
statute,
in
terms
of
local
benefits
flowing
from
the
statute
and
the
unavailability
of
non-discriminatory
alternatives
adequate
to
protect
the
local
interest,
the
state
has
never
made
any
effort
to
offer
any
non-discriminatory
alternatives
sufficient
to
protect
the
local
interest.
i
have
read
a
few
of
them.
there
are
many,
many
more.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
resource
conservation
and
recovery
act
offers
itself
many
non-discriminatory
alternatives
and
new
jersey,
by
the
statute,
wants
to
bar
itself
from
taking
part
in
that
program.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
i
am
going
to
have
to
take
that
chance,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
consume
it
then
because
i
would
like
to
pass
on
for
the
moment
to
the
supremacy
clause.
the
resource
conservation
and
recovery
act
which
was
enacted
a
few
days
prior
to
the
last
time
i
appeared
here
and
argued,
and
that
is
why
we
are
back
now,
is
a
very
comprehensive
piece
of
legislation.
i
think
it
is
a
case
actually
of
first
impression
for
this
court
in
the
sense
that
i
do
not
recall
reading
a
helping
hand
or
carrot-and-stick
type
of
federal
piece
of
legislation
wherein
you
were
presented
with
a
problem.
can
that
type
of
federal
legislation
preempts
a
state
statute?
the
new
jersey
state
statute
we
are
talking
about
is
both
prohibitory
and
discriminatory.
as
i
breakdown
the
supremacy
clause
cases,
they
dealt
with
primarily
state
statutes
that
were
regulatory
in
nature
as
opposed
to
a
federal
piece
of
that
regulation
or
prohibitory
in
nature,
and
a
couple
of
them
were
both
prohibitory
and
discriminatory
and
the
douglas
v.
seacoast
products
was
that
type
of
case.
now,
i
need
not
go
into
the
discrimination
aspect
or
the
fact
that,
actually,
the
legitimate
local
purpose
here
is
highly
suspect
because
i
have
covered
that
already.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
all
right.
thank
you
very
much.
