mr.
skillman,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
on
this
because
it
worries
me?
it
is
my
understanding
that
all
of
the
land
around
philadelphia
is
very
high-priced
land
in
mainline
etcetera.
is
anything
in
there
on
land
values
even
in
philadelphia,
around
philadelphia,
or
on
the
jersey
side
or
are
we
just
surmising
on
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
could
not
find
anything.
justice
thurgood
marshall
even
the
land
in
the
poconos
is
not
the
cheapest
land
in
the
country?
