if
you
are
right,
why
would
you
suggest
that
congress
could
solve
the
problem
or
do
you
suggest
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
under
the
commerce
clause?
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
regulate
their
state
commerce
and
waste?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
conceding
that
this
is
an
article
of
interstate
commerce
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
would?
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
least
you
would
say
it
would
affect
commerce?
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
least
you
would
say
it
would
affect
commerce?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
about
the
transportation
of
waste?
that
surely
is
commerce,
is
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
similarly,
that
is
commerce,
is
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
arguing
in
this
case
by
the
way,
not
only
that
the
federal
statute
does
not
preempt
new
jersey’s
effort,
it
does
not
foreclose
this
statute,
but
that
congress
has
given
affirmative
consent
to
new
jersey
to
do
what
is
done?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
it
had
said
“we
know
this
is
commerce,
but
we
think
that
the
state
laws
should
be
the
one
to
control
it”
and
that
is
all
congress
said?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
you
are
arguing
that
congress
has
not
preempted,
but
it
has
affirmatively
recognized
the
–
and
even
if
it
is
interstate
commerce,
it
has
subjected
it
to
the
reach
of
state
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
skillman,
let
me
try
one
situation
that
seems
to
me
it
is
somewhat
analogous
on
you.
supposing
the
new
jersey
legislature
made
a
finding
that
there
is
a
great
deal
with
air
pollution
caused
by
power
companies,
electric
utilities,
and
therefore,
to
reduce
he
environmental
hazard
associated
with
the
production
of
power
they
passed
a
statute
that
said
“power
can
only
be
produced
for
consumption
within
new
jersey.”
would
that
be
permissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
precisely
the
point
here.
there
is
an
interstate
market
for
the
waste.
some
states
can
dispose
of
it
more
cheaply
than
others.
why
is
that
any
different?
in
each
case,
there
is
a
byproduct
of
environmental
harm,
one
it
is
methane
gas
and
the
other
is
smoke?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
do
you
not
think
land
cost
has
the
availability
of
large
amounts
of
vacant
land
would
have
something
to
do
with
the
cost
of
disposing
of
this?
justice
john
paul
stevens
my
hypothesis
before
was
that
it
is
cheaper
to
dispose
of
it
in
new
jersey
than
the
district
because
real
estate
is
much
more
expensive
and
very
scarce
here.
is
it
not
the
function
of
the
availability
of
vacant
land?
