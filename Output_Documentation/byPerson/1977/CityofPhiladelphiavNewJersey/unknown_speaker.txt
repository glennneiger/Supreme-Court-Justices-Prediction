unknown
speaker
is
that
the
way
it
always
works
that
the
–
that
the
owner
of
the
land
is
the
seller
and
the
depositor
of
the
refuse
is
the
buyer?
what
if
a
person
has
land
that
he
wants
filled?
it
is
to
his
advantage
to
have
it
filled.
does
he
ever
pay
to
have
somebody
dumb
on
his
land?
unknown
speaker
and
complied
with
all
these
--
unknown
speaker
and
made
something
of
a
capital
investment
for
the
--
unknown
speaker
to
comply
with
the
regulation
of
the
law?
unknown
speaker
the
owner
of
the
land
is
always
the
seller?
unknown
speaker
but,
i
mean,
he
is
the
seller?
unknown
speaker
you
are
not
paid
for
putting
it
there?
unknown
speaker
that
is
waste
that
pennsylvania
creates.
they
consume
it,
do
they
not?
unknown
speaker
mr.
skillman,
what
ordinarily
is
the
number
of
acres
taken
by
a
typical
land?
unknown
speaker
they
vary
in
depths?
unknown
speaker
yet,
i
gather,
what
you
are
telling
us
about
leachate
is
common
to
all
landfills
whatever
size,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
number
presently
registered
of
landfills?
unknown
speaker
a
large
commercial
landfill
would
run
to
what
size?
unknown
speaker
are
they
pretty
well-scattered
up
and
down
the
state?
unknown
speaker
at
present
commercial
types,
are
they
largely
in
the
hackensack
area?
unknown
speaker
since
i
was
born,
that
has
been
true.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
judicial
finding?
unknown
speaker
mr.
skillman,
you
said
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
made
findings,
that
is
unusual.
what
about
the
superior
court?
you
have
two
cases
there,
do
you
not?
the
hackensack
--
unknown
speaker
did
either
of
the
superior
court,
on
this
issue
that
my
brother
stewart
raised
with
you,
make
a
finding?
unknown
speaker
i
know.
on
leachate,
whether
you
can
or
cannot
minimize?
unknown
speaker
on
the
elimination
of
leachate,
was
there
a
finding
based
on
conflicting
affidavits
by
the
new
jersey
supreme
court?
unknown
speaker
i
gather
you
are
saying
that,
at
the
very
least,
congress
has
not
prevented
new
jersey
from
doing
what
new
jersey
has
done.
on
the
contrary,
the
federal
statute
encourages
new
jersey
to
do
what
it
is
doing?
unknown
speaker
mr.
skillman,
the
extent
to
which
new
jersey,
the
congress
has
said
can
do
what
it
has
done,
has
it
drawn
a
distinction
between
hazardous
and
other
wastes?
unknown
speaker
new
jersey
has
less,
as
far
as
congress
is
concerned.
congress
has
reached
in
and
said
“we
will
take
care
of
most
of
the
hazardous
waste
problem.
it
is
the
rest
of
it
that
we
need
new
jersey,”
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
to
that
extent,
your
statute
cannot
apply
to
hazardous
waste?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
on
its
face
it
applies
to
your
statute?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
said
it
covers
all
wastes
known
to
man?
unknown
speaker
so
you
are
saying
the
hazardous
issue
is
not
even
here
then?
unknown
speaker
or
also,
it
is
not
even
here?
unknown
speaker
they
are
not
here
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
but,
again,
just
to
make
it
clear.
the
state
of
new
jersey
is
not
contending
that
congress
could
not,
if
it
wanted
to,
preempt
the
state
from
doing
what
it
has
done?
unknown
speaker
yes,
i
know.
unknown
speaker
just
one
question
on
that,
mr.
skillman.
does
the
record
tell
us
whether
most
of
these
large
areas
are
within
the
boundaries
of
municipalities
or
some
of
the
mountain
rural
areas?
pennsylvania
is
where
the
municipality
you
say
had
taken
up
all
the
existing
character.
unknown
speaker
so
pennsylvania,
it
allows
each
municipality
to
preempt
it
for
itself,
and
therefore,
the
whole
state
becomes
unavailable
to
anyone
else?
unknown
speaker
you
mentioned
primary.
what
factor
makes
it
a
primary,
just
proximity?
unknown
speaker
does
the
land
value
not
have
anything
to
do
with
it?
