mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
which
denied
enforcement
of
the
board's
order
directed
to
respondent
union
local
of
the
iron
workers.
the
case
involves
the
relationship
between
two
provisions
that
were
added
to
the
national
labor
relations
act
in
1959,
section
8(f)
which
permits
employers
and
unions
in
the
building
and
construction
industry
to
enter
into
agreements
before
employee
has
s
been
hired.
so
called
pre-hire
agreements
and
section
8(b)(7)(c)
which
regulates
recognitional
and
organizational
picketing
via
labor
organization
and
in
general
terms
the
question
presented
is
whether
a
pre-hire
agreement
entered
into
a
pursuant
section
8
(f)
privileges
recognitional
picketing
via
minority
union
which
would
otherwise
violate
section
8
(b)(7)(c).
now,
the
facts
are
briefly
these.
in
may
of
73,
higdon
construction
company
executed
a
contract
with
glenmore
distilleries
to
erect
the
facility
in
kentucky.
the
contract
required
higdon
to
use
union
labor
in
an
order
to
obtain
iron
workers
from
respondent
union.
it
was
required
to
sign
an
acceptance
to
the
areawide
labor
agreement
which
the
union
had
entered
into
with
a
multi-employer
association.
the
agreement
purported
to
cover
all
the
employees
who
performed
iron
work
for
signatory
employers
within
the
union's
territorial
jurisdiction.
it
contained
no
provision
requiring
employees
hired
by
the
employer
to
become
union
members.
union
security
clause,
no
provision
requiring
the
employer
to
check
off
union
dooms.
higdon
construction
performed
the
glenmore
job
with
some
of
its
own
employees
who
were
nonunion
and
with
some
employees
who
were
supplied
by
the
union.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
agreement
contained
provisions
establishing
wage
rights,
welfare
and
pension
benefits
and
working
rules
for
these
employees.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
did
not
have
a
union
security
clause
in
it
or
a
check
off
provision.
mr.
norton
j.
come
as
i
mean,
the
acceptance
here
you
would.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
board's
position
would
be
different
as
indicated
by
the
--
if
the
union
security
clause
were
enforced.
mr.
norton
j.
come
by
the
employer,
in
that
situation
the
board
would
treat
it
like
an
ordinary
collected
bargaining
agreement
which
carries
with
it
a
presumption
that
the
union
has
majority
status.
the
board
found
and
the
court
of
appeals
accepted
that
finding,
that
neither
at
the
time
the
labor
agreement
was
executed,
nor
thereafter
the
union
claim
to
or
in
fact
represent
a
majority
of
higdon
constructions
employees
at
the
glenmore
project.
meanwhile,
higdon
contracting
was
formed,
to
perform
nonunion
iron
jobs
and
it
did
successfully
on
two
jobs,
grace
and
warmet(ph)
and
began
work
on
them
with
nonunion
labor.
when
higdon
refused
to
apply
the
prior
agreement
to
these
jobs,
the
union
picketed
the
jobs
which
signed
stating
that
higdon
construction
was
in
the
violation
of
the
previous
pre-hire
agreement
was
entered
into
at
the
glenmoore
job.
higdon
contracting
filed
an
8
(b)(7)
charge
and
the
board
found
that
the
violation
of
that
provision.
it
preliminarily
found
that
the
agreement
between
the
union
and
higdon,
although
it
was
a
pre-hire
agreement
sanctioned
by
8(f)
did
not
privilege
the
picketing
at
the
grace
job
site
as
a
means
of
enforcing
that
agreement
because
there
was
no
showing
that
the
union
had
ever
acquired
a
majority
under
the
agreement
to
form
a
full
collective
bargaining
relationship.
the
board
in
so
holding
relied
on
its
earlier
decision
in
r.j.
smith
holding
that
a
pre-hire
agreement
without
proof
that
the
union
had
acquired
a
majority
support
there
under
did
not
carry
with
it
presumption
that
the
union
had
become
the
section
9
(a)
or
majority
representative
of
the
employees.
court
of
appeals
which
it
set
aside
the
board's
decision
in
r.j.
smith,
also
set
aside
its
decision
here.
now,
it
is
a
established
principle
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
that
employee
shall
be
free
to
select
their
own
bargaining
representative,
that
an
employer
is
obligated
to
bargain
under
section
8(a)(5)
of
the
act
only
with
the
representative
designated
by
a
majority
of
the
employees
in
a
appropriate
unit
and
that
it
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
both
under
part
of
the
employer
and
the
union
to
enter
into
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
when
the
union
does
not
represent
a
majority
of
the
employees.
even
though
the
parties
may
in
good
faith
belief
that
they
do
and
even
though
subsequently
the
union
may
in
fact
acquire
a
majority.
now,
section
8(b)(7)(c)
provides
significant
additional
protection
or
the
employees'
rights
of
free
choice
by
prohibiting
a
union
which
is
not
currently
certified
as
a
bargaining
representative
of
the
employees
from
picketing
to
force
the
employer,
to
recognize
it
as
the
employees
representative
for
more
than
30
days
unless
a
representation
petition
is
filed.
if
a
timely
petition
is
filed,
then
a
provision
is
made
for
an
expedited
election
and
the
whole
theory
of
8
(b)(7)(c)
is
to
channel
disputes
concerning
the
representation
status
of
the
union
from
the
picket
line
into
the
board's
representation
procedures.
the
union's
picketing
here
came
squarely
within
8
(b)(7)(c).
it
had
never
been
certified
by
the
board
as
the
representative
of
higdon's
employees,
nor
had
it
otherwise
been
selected
by
a
majority
of
those
employees.
nevertheless
the
union
picketed
here
for
more
than
30
days
during
which
time
no
representation
petition
was
filed.
the
evolved
purpose
of
the
picketing
was
to
compel
higdon
to
adhere
to
the
pre-hire
agreement
executed
for
the
glenmore
job,
the
necessary
effect
of
which
would
have
been
to
recognize
the
union
as
the
representative
of
the
employees
at
the
grace
job
site
even
though
they
had
never
selected
the
union
as
their
representative.
now,
the
basic
question
that
we
come
down
to
here
is
whether
the
8
(f)
agreement
removes
the
picketing
from
the
reach
of
8
(b)(7)(c)
on
the
theory
that
such
agreement
by
operation
of
law
has
established
the
union
as
the
section
9
(a)
or
majority
representative
of
higdon's
employees
and
thus
the
representation
question
is
already
been
resolved.
in
the
board's
view,
and
8
(f)
agreement
does
not
without
more
establish
that
the
union
is
the
majority
representative.
it
is
merely
a
preliminarily
step
that
contemplates
further
action
to
establish
a
full
bargaining
relationship.
hence,
absent
to
showing
that
the
union
has
required
such
majority
support,
neither
the
agreement
is
enforceable,
neither
through
a
bargaining
order
issued
under
section
8
(a)(5)
which
obligates
the
imperative
bargain
with
the
majority
representative,
nor
does
it
insulate
the
picketing
from
8
(b)(7)(c)
picketing.
now,
the
board's
position
rests
upon
the
following
considerations.
in
the
first
place,
we
start
with
the
language
of
the
statute
which
is
set
forth
at
page
three
of
the
board's
brief.
it
provides
that
it
shall
not
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
employers
or
unions
in
the
construction
industry
to
make
an
agreement
covering
employees
engaged
or
who
upon
their
employment
will
be
engaged
in
that
industry
because
the
majority
status
of
such
labor
organization
has
not
been
established
under
the
provisions
of
section
9,
prior
to
the
making
of
such
agreement.
now,
nothing
in
that
language
suggests
that
it
was
intended
to
confer
upon
a
union
that
is
a
party
to
a
pre-hire
agreement.
the
status
of
a
section
9
(a)
or
majority
representative.
congress
did
not
in
section
8
(f)
or
elsewhere
modify
sections
8
(a)(5)
or
9
(a).
the
former
as
i
have
indicated
obligates
the
employer
to
bargain
with
the
representative
of
his
employees
subject
to
the
provisions
of
9
(a)
and
9
(a)
defines
the
bargaining
representative
as
the
representative
selected
by
the
majority
of
the
employees
in
an
appropriate
unit.
moreover,
while
the
board's
well
established
contract
bar
rules
would
preclude
the
board
from
entertaining
a
representation
petition
during
the
life
of
a
collective
â€“
an
ordinary
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
last
proviso
of
the
section
8
(f)
which
is
on
page
four
of
the
brief
provides
that
any
agreement
which
would
be
invalid
but
for
clause
one
which
permits
without
the
majority
being
established,
shall
not
be
a
bar
to
a
petition
filed
pursuant
to
section
9
(c)
which
is
a
the
provision
that
for
determining
a
representation
questions
or
9
(e)
which
is
a
provision
that
permits
employees
to
de-authorize
a
union
security
clause.
now,
the
legislative
history,
we
believe
confirms
that
congress
in
authorizing
pre-hire
agreements
intended
to
do
nothing
more,
because
of
the
peculiar
characteristics
of
the
building
and
construction
industry
to
relieve
them
from
what
would
otherwise
be
a
clear
violation
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
i
have
mentioned
earlier
that
--and
this
court
so
held
in
the
garment
workers
case
a
number
of
years
ago,
that
in
the
ordinary
case,
an
employer
and
a
union
have
to
have
a
representative
complement
of
employees
on
board
and
the
union
has
to
represent
a
majority
of
them
before
you
can
enter
into
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
this
did
not
work
for
the
building
and
construction
industry
because
of
the
short
term
nature
of
most
construction
projects,
and
the
fact
that
the
employers
ordinarily
lacked
a
steady
complement
of
employees,
is
necessary
for
employers
to
enter
into
labor
agreements
before
the
job
is
started
or
the
workers
are
hired.
so,
8
(f)
was
enacted
to
relieve
them
of
having
to
comply
with
what
would
otherwise
be
an
impossible
rule
for
the
building
and
construction
industry
and
it
caused
a
lot
of
trouble
under
the
taft-hartley
act
in
administering
because
it
just
did
not
fit.
but
we
submit
that
that
is
as
far
as
congress
intended
to
go,
it
did
not
intend
to
relieve
unions
of
the
responsibility
of
acquiring
a
majority
support
under
these
contracts.
congress
thought
that
in
the
typical
case
that
would
happen
because
the
employer
would
draw
from
a
pool
of
skilled
craftsmen
in
the
area
who
are
usually
are
often
union
members.
secondly,
it
permitted
the
negotiation
of
union
security
provisions
which
gave
employees
seven
days
instead
of
the
normal
30,
to
join
the
union.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
if
the
employer
and
the
union
abided
by
the
agreement
and
if
the
union
acquired
the
majority
support
under
the
agreement,
there
would
be
enforcement.
mr.
norton
j.
come
under
the
board's
position,
if
the
union
had
not
acquired
a
majority
support,
if
the
employer
failed
to
abide
by
the
contract
there
would
not
be
an
enforceable
obligation
under
section
8
(a)(5)
of
the
statute.
the
board
would
not
issue
a
bargaining
order
requiring
the
employer
to
abide
by
the
agreement,
whether
there
would
be
a
suit
under
301
or
some
other
suit
for
the
recovery
of
wages
under
that
contract
or
the
period
under
which
it
was
observed
is
a
question
that
the
board
has
not
passed
on.
but
in
so
far
as
the
board
is
concerned
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
that
would
be
the
logical
implication.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
your
honor,
that
that
is
the
point
here
that
this
in
the
board's
view,
this
pre-hire
agreement
is
not
a
full
contract.
it
gives
the
union,
a
right
to
enter
into
the
agreement,
but
it
takes
subsequent
action
to
mature
that
into
a
full
collective
bargaining
arrangement.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
you
need
8
(f)
because
the
mere
entry
into
the
contract
would
have
been
illegal
without
8
(f)
and
you
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
can
be
if
the
union
has
acquired
majority
support
onto
the
contract
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
you
needed
8
(f)
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
you
need
8
(f)
to
give
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
initial
period
to
apply
a
majority,
even
under
the
court
of
appeal's
position,
the
agreement
does
not
have
much
more
effect
because
the
court
of
appeals
agrees
and
i
do
not
understand
my
brother
to
disagree
that
the
entry
into
the
agreement
does
not
relieve
the
union
of
the
necessity
to
acquire
a
majority
support
under
it.
so
that,
if
the
employer
were
to
file
a
petition
or
the
employees
or
a
union
and
a
union
that
entered
into
that
contract
were
found
to
have
a
minority
status,
that
contract
would
be
unenforceable
and
come
to
an
end.
mr.
norton
j.
come
lion
dry
goods
your
honor
and
we
have
addressed
ourselves
to
that
more
fully
in
our
reply
brief,
holds
that
the
strike
settlement
agreement,
there
is
jurisdiction
under
section
301
to
entertain
a
suit
on
a
strike
settlement
agreement,
not
withstanding
the
fact
that
the
union
does
not
purport
to
represent
a
majority
of
the
employees
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
holding
was
--
as
i
read
the
holding,
in
parse
your
honor
wrote
it,
so,
he
probably
is
more
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
the
precise
holding
was
that
there
was
jurisdiction,
that
it
was
not
jurisdiction
was
not
defeated
merely
because
it
was
not
a
typical
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
jurisdiction
to
entertain
the
suit
and
i
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
does
not
mean
the
plaintiff
would
have
won,
similarly
even
though
the
court
in
reaching
that
conclusion
pointed
to
8
(f)
is
another
form
of
minority
agreement.
mr.
norton
j.
come
but
i
go
on,
we
go
on
to
point
out
that
it
does
not
indicate
under
what
circumstances
it
would
be
and
we
submit
that
there
are
circumstances
under
which
an
8
(f)
agreement
would
be
enforceable
clearly
at
the
union
acquired
a
majority
support
on
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yeah,
without
8
(f)
that
agreement
would
have
been
illegal
to
begin
with.
mr.
norton
j.
come
similarly,
there
are
circumstances
under
which
even
under
the
court
of
appeal's
position
the
8
(f)
agreement
would
not
be
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
if
that
is
an
8
(f)
--.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
gets
to
the
question
as
to
whether
that
is
the
only
way
in
which
congress
visualized.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
really
can
imagine
of
â€“
i
can
not
image
of
what
is
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
we
submit
that
without
a
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
you
do,
but,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
norton
j.
come
just
a
small
point
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
close
by
calling
the
court's
attention
again
to
the
garment
workers
case.
one,
that
was
the
case
that
held
that
there
was
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
employer
and
union
entered
into
a
contract
where
the
union
did
not
have
a
majority,
even
though
the
parties
in
good
faith
believed
that
they
did
and
that
shortly
thereafter
the
union
did
acquire
a
majority
and
the
court
not
only
so
held
but
it
went
on
to
find
that
since
that
contract
was
an
unfair
labor
practice
to
enter
into
it,
it
was
not
even
enforcible
with
respect
to
the
members
of
the
union
only.
and
we
submit
that
you
have
to
look
at
what
congress
did
against
the
backdrop
of
the
garment
workers
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
off
hand,
i
do
not
see
too
much
of
a
problem
with
that
but
you
do
get
to
the
point
where
how
much
of
the
contract
is
being
enforced
and
if
you
get
to
enforcing
beyond
that
then
you
get
the
union
equivalent
of
recognition.
mr.
norton
j.
come
your
honor,
as
we
read
the
record
the
union
was
complaining
about
a
lot
more
than
that.
they
wanted
the
whole
contract
applied
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
filed
a
refusal
of
bargaining
charge
with
the
board
when
the
employer
took
the
position
that
this
project
was
a
different
project
and
had
no
obligation
to
recognize
the
union
on
their
project.
so
this
is
a
recognition
dispute,
whatever
maybe
the
answer
in
one
where
recognition
is
not
so.
the
other
point
that
i
wish
to
make
is
that
the
second
proviso
to
9
(f)
provides
a
means
by
which
the
contract
can
be
brought
to
an
end.
namely
petitioning
for
an
election
and
the
question
is
whether
that
is
the
only
means.
there
again
we
submit,
that
the
answer
is
afforded
by
looking
at
the
scheme
of
the
act
and
the
scheme
of
the
act
is
that
traditionally
there
have
been
two
ways
by
which
an
employer
can
withdraw
recognition
from
a
union.
he
can
either
do
that
by
filing
a
petition
under
section
9
of
the
act
which
is
explicit
or
he
take
his
chances
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding.
that
is
not
specifically
set
forth
in
the
act.
we
submit
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
take
away
that
avenue
from
the
employer
which
is
what
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
is
the
normal
situation.
that
is
what
congress
contemplated
what
happened
and
the
question
is
how
do
you
take
care
of
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
of
this
board
case
and
there
you
have
to
balance
8
(f)
against
8
(b)(7)(c).
as
your
honor
pointed
out
the
same
congress
enacted
it.
they
look
in
different
directions.
we
submit
that
the
board
made
a
reasonable
accommodation
here
in
the
balance
that
it
struck
for
the
support
or
a
typical
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
your
honor,
i
think
that
what
has
happened
is
that
there
are
several
different
parts
of
the
building
and
construction
industry.
there
is
residential
construction
where
as
i
understand
it,
it
is
not
uncommon
to
use
nonunion
labor
because
they
can
not
complete
by
using
union
labor.
in
big
construction,
commercial
construction
that
is
more
unionized.
as
a
result
of
that
you
have
had
the
practice
of
these
double-breasted
corporations
being
set
up
in
the
building
and
construction
industry
where
they
operate
union
on
the
big
jobs
and
nonunion
on
the
small
jobs
and
this
is
really
the
problem
in
this
case
and
there
is
nothing
unlawful
under
the
act
in
setting
up
these
different
methods.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
whether
you
will
or
not.
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
your
honor
because
as
i
pointed
out
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
typical
case
is
not
this
one.
