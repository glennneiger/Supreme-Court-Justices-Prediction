unknown
speaker
but
what
did
the
agreement
contain
mr.
come?
unknown
speaker
but--
unknown
speaker
were
there
pension
requirements
or
suppose
there
were
no
union
members
hired
on
a
job.
would
still
have
to
contribute
to
a
pension?
unknown
speaker
i
see,
thank
you.
and
would
the
board's
position
be
any
different
if
there
were
a
union
security
clause
in
the
--
unknown
speaker
by
the
employer
you
mean.
unknown
speaker
mr.
come,
could
i
interrupt
you
for
just
a
minute?
if
i
understand
you
are
saying
that
the
8
(f)
removed
the
legal
rule
that
would
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
the
union
to
enter
into
such
an
agreement,
but
it
did
not
have
the
effect
of
making
the
union,
the
collective
bargaining
agent
of
the
employees.
what
is
the
net
result
of
this,
the
creation
of
a
valid
enforceable
contract
or
not?
i
gather
you
are
saying
it
was
not.
if
not,
how
would
it
under
–
let
me
get
the
whole
thought
out,
how
then
would
they
determine
whether
the
employees
could
insist
on
being
paid
the
wage
rates
specified
in
the
agreement,
for
example,
or
bonuses
at
the
end
of
these
–
were
these
enforcement
obligations
or
not?
unknown
speaker
no,
my
assumption
would
be
that
the
union
never
gets
the
majority
status,
but
toward
the
end
of
the
contract
terms,
it
is
–
when
they
finish
the
building,
the
company
just
decides
well,
we
have
decided
not
to
pay
you
that
amount,
we
think
we
agreed
to
pay
more
than
we
should
have,
it
is
not
an
enforceable
contract,
we
will
give
you
the
reasonable
value
of
your
services
and
that
is
it.
will
they
be
free
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
would
not
the
logical
implication
to
your
position
be
that
no
such
suit
could
be
obtained
on
the
contract
even
though
there
might
some
kind
of
a
quantum
meruit
claim
or
something
like
that.
unknown
speaker
oh,
that
is
much
of
a
contract,
in
the
normal
sense
of
that
word,
even
in
the
sense
of
collective
bargaining
contract,
if
it
is
not
binding
on
anybody,
that
is
not
an
agreement,
it
is
not
a
contract.
unknown
speaker
really,
all
in
your
submission,
all
the
8(f)
does
is
exempt
the
employer
and
the
union
from
charges
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
to
the
extent
of
what
it
does.
unknown
speaker
that
is
always
true.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
come,
on
the
hypothetical
my
brother
steven's
posed
to
you
and
that
is
a
breach
is
on
the
wage
provision
of
a
8
(f)
contract.
does
not
lion
dry
goods
suggest
that
would
be
enforceable
in
the
court
under
301?
unknown
speaker
what
was
in
the
holding,
it
is
some
while
since
i
read,
it
was
not
the
holding
in
lion
dry
woods
that
the
strike
settlement
agreement
was
enforceable
in
this
301
suit
and
at
the
holding?
unknown
speaker
i
would
suggest
that,
i
have
read
it
a
while,
but
my
recollection
is
that
i
do
not
know
why
would
we
have
written
a
decision
if
we
did
not
hold
that
the
agreement
--
strike
settlement
agreement
was
enforceable.
unknown
speaker
jurisdiction
to
do
what.
to
decide
that
--
to
decide
that
it
was
not
enforceable?
unknown
speaker
does
not
mean
that
the
plaintiff
would
gave
won
--
unknown
speaker
it
is
definitely,
i
am
reading
from
your
own
brief,
in
looking
as
to
lion
dry
woods,
the
court
indicated
its
view,
that
the
strike
settlement
agreement
in
that
case
would
be
enforceable.
do
you
cite
through
369
us
27.
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
because
of
the
initial
8
(f)
agreement,
that
is
because
of
subsequent
development.
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
an
unfair
labor
practice,
yes
you
have
told
us
that
and
that
is
correct
obviously.
unknown
speaker
well,
because
that
is
explicitly
covered
by
the
second
proviso.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
that
is
of
8
(f),
is
not
it?
unknown
speaker
that
is
really
the
nub
of
the
controversy
between
you
and
your
brother,
is
not
it.
as
i
understand
your
briefs.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
can
imaging
what
you
have
got
here
now,
that
what
you
have
got
here
now.
unknown
speaker
and
what
is
involved
here
is
statutory
construction.
we
can
just
assume
that
this
is
the
same
employer
even
though
there
was
a
change
of
corporate
form
but
that
is
conceded
now
is
it
not?
we
assume
that
this
was
the
same
employer
on
all
three
matters.
unknown
speaker
alright,
and
that
is
really
all
this
about.
