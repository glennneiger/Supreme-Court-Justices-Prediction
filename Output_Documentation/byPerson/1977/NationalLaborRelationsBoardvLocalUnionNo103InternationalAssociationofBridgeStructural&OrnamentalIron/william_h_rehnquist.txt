it
is
a
useful
footnote
in
your
brief
i
guess.
justice
william

rehnquist
the
practical
consequences
is
that
the
decision
one
way
or
the
other
is
just
which
side
has
to
petition
for
an
election.
justice
william

rehnquist
of
course,
when
you
say
everybody
signs
a
contract
in
good
faith.
your
typical
construction
industry
contractor
signs
one
of
those
agreements
at
the
time
he
may
have
no
employees
at
all.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
did
not
the
board
distinguish
the
peculiar
circumstances
in
oilfield
research
from
the
ordinary
construction.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
i
suppose
this
case
is
a
prime
example
of
the
board's
refusal
to
extend
oilfields.
since
the
board
did
not
came
out
the
way
it
did.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
all
8(f)
says
is
that
it
shall
not
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
an
employer
to
do
this.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
the
government's
submission
,
that
is
its
purpose
just
to
exempt
the
employer
from
a
charge
of
engaging
an
unfair
labor
practice.
