if
it
is
just
as
i
understand,
it
is
just
a
piece
of
paper
signed
that
has
no
bond
and
effect
on
anybody.

and
that
is
an
agreement?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
an
agreement
which
on
its
face
says
that
it
is
unenforceable
by
each
side
be
an
unfair
labor
practice?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
do
not
really
be
there
after
--.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
mean
that
in
the
building
industry
it
is
normal
for
building
contractors
to
prefer
not
deal
nonunion
labor.

so
if
we
rule
with
you
on
this
then
we
will
see
more
of
that.
