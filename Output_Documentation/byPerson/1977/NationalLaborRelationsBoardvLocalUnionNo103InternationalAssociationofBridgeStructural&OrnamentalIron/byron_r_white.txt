justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
but
your
position
would
be
the
same
that
had
been
in
the
chicanery
or
subterfuge?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
far
as
you
are
right
to
picket
to
enforce
this
contract.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
labor
board
which
has
first
obligation
in
these
matters,
did
not
decide
the
case
on
that
basis.
is
it
in
the
case
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
we
have
many
basis
for
deciding
the
case
on
another
ground.
have
we?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah
i
know
but
the
board
did
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you
if
the
picketing
--
if
the
contract
as
you
understand
it
call
for
the
company
do
bargain
with
the
union.
was
the
picketing
intended
to
put
pressure
on
the
employer
to
bargain
of
the
union
as
the
bargaining
agent
for
the
employees
or
just
do
enforce
the
wage
provisions
and
other
provisions?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
would
not
have
needed
to
bargain
with
the
union
at
all,
is
it
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
an
arbitration
provision,
were
agreements
in
arbitration
provisions
in
this
pre-hire
agreement
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
understand
that.
i
understand
that
but
if
there
were
agreements
and
arbitrations
provisions
in
the
contract
i
suppose
the
union
then
would
have
been
in
position
of
acting
as
the
collective
bargaining
agent
in
administering
the
contract.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
was
not
involved
here
do
you
think?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
doubt
if
there
is
much
argument
about
the
purpose
mr.
berger.
tell
me
it
is
a
fact
here
the
employer
did
not
seek
an
election.
is
that
not
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
know
why.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
of
course,
you
know
why
they
did
not
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
would
not
satisfy
you
if
a
court
were
to
hold,
or
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
your
pre-hire
is
enforceable
on
the
courts
but
not
by
picketing.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
says
legally.
legally
would
you
find
that
attainable
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
that
this
is
not
a
statutory
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
will
put
it
this
way.
would
your
aims
be
--
could
you
achieve
your
aims
by
through
legal
action
rather
than
by
picketing?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
ask
you
once
more.
do
you
think
that
you
would
have
been
entitled
to
picket
if
you
had
asked
the
employer
to
recognize
of
the
union
as
the
collective
bargaining
agent
and
the
employer
has
said
no
i
will
not,
but
of
course
i
will
pay
the
wages
that
the
agreement
calls
for.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
i
want
to
know
is
with
the
contract
would
you
say
he
had
to
recognize
you
as
the
collective
bargaining
agent.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
answer
is
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
was
not
the
refusal
to
bargain?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
just
as
a
--.
justice
byron
r.
white
who
were
the
beneficiaries
of
the
pension
plan?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
this
is
not
something
new
on
the
part
of
board,
is
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
mean
this
is
some
new
and
novel
interpretation
of
the
act
for
the
board.
justice
byron
r.
white
have
you
ever
held
this
before?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
well
i
mean
it
has
it
ever
held
it
a
contrary.
i
mean
has
this
been
the
board's
consistent
position
as
far
as
you
can
tell.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
apparently
the
board's
feels
that
either
construction
is
consistent
with
the
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
case
involves
section
8f
of
national
labor
relations
act.
the
provision
which
permits
employers
and
unions
in
the
construction
industry
to
enter
in
their
so
called
pre-hire
agreements.
setting
wages
and
hours
and
working
conditions,
even
though
union
does
not
then
represent
a
majority
of
the
employees
that
might
be
working
on
later
projects,
that
the
employer
undertakes.
the
section
however
permits
the
union,
or
the
employer
or
the
employees
to
seek
an
election
at
any
time
after
the
signing
of
pre-hire
agreement.
and
the
union
must
then
demonstrate
its
majority
status,
if
it
is
to
purport
to
represent
all
of
the
employees
in
the
unit.
this
case
arises
because
of
the
national
labor
relations
board's
rule,
that
the
union's
majority
status
is
also
up
for
challenging
and
fairly
reflected
its
proceedings.
here
the
union
picketed
the
employer
claiming
that
the
employer
was
in
violation
of
his
pre-hire
agreement.
the
employer
responded
by
filing
a
charge
with
the
board
claiming
that
the
picketing
was
recognitional
picketing
contrary
to
section
87.
the
board
held
that,
that
because
the
union
had
not
demonstrated
its
majority.
indeed
it
was
stipulated
that
it
had
no
majority
at
that
time.
that
the
union
was
not
entitled
to
picket,
to
enforce
a
contract
in
the
manner
that
a
collective
bargaining
agent
could
do
and
the
board
went
on
to
hold
that
the
picketing
was
recognitional
and
in
violation
of
87.
court
of
appeals
reversed,
the
court
held
essentially
that
although
the
union's
standing
was
challengable
in
an
election.
it
was
not
a
challengable
and
unfair
labor
practice
proceedings
and
the
union
thus
here
was
simply
picketing
to
enforce
a
contract
as
it
was
entitled
to
do
according
to
the
court
of
appeals.
we
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
reasons
that
will
appear
in
the
opinion
we
have
filed,
we
agree
essentially
with
the
national
labor
relations
board.
we
think
their
construction,
application
of
the
act
is
reasonable
of
one
even
if
not
the
only
one
that
might
be
acceptable.
so
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
stewart
has
filed
the
dissenting
opinion
and
he
has
joined
by
justices
blackmun
and
stevens.
