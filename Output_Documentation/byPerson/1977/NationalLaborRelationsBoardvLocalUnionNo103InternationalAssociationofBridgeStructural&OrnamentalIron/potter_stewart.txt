okay
all
that
language
has
to
deal
with
as
whether
or
not
this
was
a
different
employer
and
you
won
on
that,
okay,
this
is
the
same
employer,
your
honor
won
that
point.

that
is
if
the
employer
enforced
it.
the
board
says
that
would
be
true
if
the
employer
enforced
the

8

and

they
certainly
look
in
quite

were

well
it
so.
it
clearly
carves
out
an
exception
and
the
question
i
suppose
in
this
case
is
how
big
is
the
exception
and
what
is
the
scope
of
the
exception?
justice

it
clearly

justice

could
i
ask
you,
does
the
record
show
what
conduct
does
the
employer,
the
union
claimed
was
in
breach
of
the
contract
and
which
provoked
the
picketing.
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
no
argument
i
think
about
what
the
legislative
history
says
or
what
the
purpose
of
this
is.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
do
you
have
an
unfair
labor
practice
or
do
you
not
have
an
unfair
labor
practice.
that
is
what
8
(f)
is
directed
to,
by
its
terms.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
mr.
come
how
would
it
derogate
the
interest
that
you
think
support
your
side
of
the
case
to
hold
the
substantive
provisions
of
the
contract
rather
than
the
recognition
provisions
or
the
bargaining
provisions
to
be
enforceable
in
a
301
suit.
as
long
as
the
union
did
not
purport
to
be
representing
all
the
employees
or
demand
that
it
would
be
recognized
as
such,
why
not
permit
the
wage
provisions
for
example,
to
the
enforcement
on
301
suit?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
union
apparently
was
complaining
here
about
his
failure
to
live
up
to
the
wage
and
the
welfare
and
pension
agreement.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
come,
how
often
would
that
situation
like
we
have
in
this
case
arise
as
a
matter
of
the
fact.
that
very
rarely,
would
not
normally
an
8
(f)
be
complied
with
by
both
sides
and
would
it
not
normally
be
assumed
that
the
employees
represented
were
a
majority
of
the
union
that
it
made
an
8
(f)
bargaining
in
advance.
