mr.
sydney
l.
berger
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
first
of
all,
i
would
respectfully
call
to
your
attention,
there
are
important
facts
in
the
record
omitted
in
the
opening
statement.
one,
there
is
a
history
of
an
eight
year
collective
bargaining
relationship
between
this
employer
and
our
client
local
103
of
the
iron
workers.
two,
the
record
is
undisputed
that
this
employer
formed
a
new
company
solely
“to
get
around
the
contract”.
as
a
result
of
that
the
administrative
law
judge
found,
the
analog
b
found
that
the
employer
was
guilty
of
chicanery
of
subterfuge,
of
the
shame
and
the
district
judge,
united
states
district
judge
in
owensboro,
to
whom
the
board
went
for
an
injunction
were
only
had
a
proof
was
that
the
regional
director
had
reasonable
cause
to
believe,
he
committed
a
unfair
---
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
mr.
justice
white,
i
would
say
yes
and
no.
i
would
say
yes
our
position
would
be
the
same
as
far
as
statutory
interpretation
is
concerned.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
yes.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
yes
sir.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
well,
may
i
respectfully
suggest
this
to
the
court
that
this
is
not
only
accord
of
law
but
accord
of
justice
and
it
says
on
the
precending
--
i
came
in
the
steps
with
law
and
came
in
to
this
chamber
of
equal
justice
under
the
law
and
i
suggest
that
if
the
board's
position
is
upheld
and
if
the
court
finds
that
this
employee
who
was
guilty
of
chicanery
and
all
of
that
subterfuge
and
shame
was
right
and
that
our
client
was
wrong
and
injustice
has
been
done
and
i
think
that.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
you
are
correct
mr.
justice
white
in
this.
it
is
not
in
the
decision
of
the
labor
board.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
except
that
the
record
is
undisputedly
administered
of
law
judge
use
that
as
a
basis
for
his
disagreement.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
that
is
right
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
okay
thank
you
mr.
justice
stewart
i
will
now
move
from
that
premise.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
thank
you
sir
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
in
any
event
the
record
also
shows
that
the
only
purpose
of
the
picketing
was
to
require
the
employer
to
honor
its
contract
with
the
local
union
and
the
record
finally
is
undisputed
that
this
contract
covered
all
of
the
employers,
employees
and
all
of
the
job
sites.
now
this
is
important.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
just
to
enforce
the
wage
provisions
and
to
honor
the
contract.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
that
is
right.
it
only
had
to
do
is
live
to
up
to
his
contract.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
i
do
not
recall
that
but
it
would
not
have
mattered
because
the
employer
would
not
have
honored
any
agreements.
mr.
justice
white,
you
just
said
i
am
not
complying
with
the
contract
because
there
is
other
company
that
i
formed
with
that.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
correct
sir.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
i
do
not
think
so
sir.
now,
the
board's
interpretation
of
this
agreement
is
in
effect
an
attempt
to
rewrite
the
statute
because
what
the
board
says
section
8
(f)
means
is
that
a
contract
is
not
a
contract
until
the
union
establishes
its
majority
at
each
job
site.
now
if
congress
had
wanted
the
union
to
do
that.
if
congress
had
intended
that
an
8
(f)
contract
is
valid
only
when
the
union
establishes
its
majority
would
have
said
so.
the
act
is
silent
on
that,
further
more,
the
legislative
history
that
they
speak
about
was
mentioned
by
the
court
of
appeals
four
years
ago
on
the
local
150
case,
when
they
said
we
confine
no
sanction
in
the
language,
history
or
policy.
history
meaning
legislative
history
or
section
8
(f)
to
permit
an
employer
to
abrogate
unilaterally
validly
executed
pre-hire
agreement,
or
to
permit
an
employer
to
commit
one
of
these
otherwise
an
unfair
labor
practice,
even
though
at
that
time
the
union
has
not
obtained
majority
status.
now
the
question
is
suggested
in
the
board's
briefs
that
what
about
the
employees
wishes
in
that.
well
that
proviso
takes
care
of
that
because
the
proviso
says
that
unlike
a
normal
contract
where
you
can
have
an
election
because
of
the
contract
bar
at
any
time,
at
any
time
after
an
8
(f)
contract
is
signed,
the
employees
if
they
feel
the
union
is
not
representing
and
they
do
not
want
the
union,
the
employer,
if
he
feels
that
this
is
not
a
union
which
represents
a
majority
of
these
employees
or
any
other
union
can
come
in
and
get
an
election.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
but
it
is
much
more
than
that
in
simple
case,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
because
our
interpretation,
the
correct
interpretation
is
the
contract
is
valid
until
an
election
is
held
at
which
the
union
loses.
if
the
union
loses
and
is
no
longer
a
majority
representative,
then
the
contract
is
then
terminated
and
no
longer
effective.
but
until
then
it
is
a
valid
contract.
the
board's
construed
sophistry
and
in
trying
to
say
is
this
a
contract.
it
is
not
a
contract
and
the
union
has
to
go
and
petition
for
an
election
means,
you
do
not
have
a
contract.
everybody
signs
a
document
in
good
faith.
the
employer
agrees
to
pay
certain
wages
and
working
condition
and
then
it
can
just
say
i
do
not
have
to
because
you
have
approved
to
the
union
that
you
have
a
contract.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
that
is
right
in
the
legislative,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
the
legislative
history
which
is
relied
on
since
that
is
the
purpose
of
it,
in
reading
from
the
standard
committee
on
labor
and
welfare
report
which
both
sides
concede
is
the
authoritative
document
and
it
is
set
out
at
pages
many
places
but
in
the
board's
brief
at
pages
20
and
21
says
that
such
labor
agreements
necessarily
apply
to
jobs
which
have
not
been
started
and
may
not
even
be
contemplated.
the
practice
of
signing
of
such
agreements
for
future
employment
is
not
entirely
consistent
with
wager
act's
ruling
and
then
they
said
that
exclusive
contracts
can
lawfully
be
concluded
only
if
the
lot
of
people
have
signed.
he
said
this
is
the
reason
why
it
has
to
be
different
in
the
construction
industry.
one
is
that
the
employer
has
to
know
his
labor
costs.
two,
he
has
to
have
available
a
supply
of
skilled
craftsmen
and,
therefore
the
history
shows
that
the
purpose
of
an
8
(f)
contract
is
to
legitimatize
the
practice
of
a
union
and
an
employer
signing
a
contract
for
three
years
as
done
in
this
case
and
is
not
throughout
the
contract
two
or
three
years
or
one
year
to
assure
a
supply
of
skilled
craftsmen
to
give
stability
in
the
industry.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
that
is
right
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
the
record
is
silent
on
that.
i
can
theorize
but
if
the
record
is
silent,
the
employees
also
did
not
seek
an
election.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
i
do
not
know
why.
i
can
guess
but
i
am
sure
your
honor
is
able
to
do
that
better
than
i,
but
the
point
is,
it
is
undisputed
they
had
the
right
to
do
that
at
any
time.
instead
of
tearing
up
the
contract
in
effect
they
could
have
used
the
remedy
which
congress
gave
them
to
do
so.
the
board
points
out
that
it
is
worried
about
tuck
down
organizing,
yet
the
board
says
that
if
in
this
contract
there
was
a
union
security
provision
which
would
have
required
employees
on
the
job
to
join
the
union
after
eight
days
which
is
permitted
under
the
act
then
the
union
would
have
a
presumption
of
majority
statute.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
yes
sir.
but
the
point
is
mr.
justice
stewart
that
i
want
to
make
to
the
court
is
that
this
would
encourage
unions
to
force
employees
to
join
rather
than
give
them
a
chance
to
assert
their
wishes
in
an
election
which
is
freely
held
as
provided
in
the
proviso
of
the
section
8
(f).
now
the
board's
interpretation
aside
from
its
inconsistency
and
illogicality
has
several
very
bad
effects.
they
are
shown
by
the
fact
that
they
cite
in
their
reply
brief,
for
example,
this
d.c.
case
which
the
board
just
handed
out.
now
in
the
d.c.
case
you
had
a
similar
situation
of
an
employer
who
had
formed
another
corporation
and
disregarded
union
collective
bargaining
agreement
who
insisted
that
if
you
wanted
to
keep
working
for
him,
the
employees
would
have
to
drop
out
of
the
union.
this
was
a
blatant
unfair
labor
practice
and
the
board
so
ruled
but
yet
the
board
said
that
despite
that
the
agreement
which
the
employer
had
signed
which
he
violated
was
not
binding
on
the
union
because
the
union
did
not
prove
it
represented
the
majority
of
the
employees
at
each
particular
site
but
the
employer's
unfair
labor
practice
prevented
the
union
from
getting
majority
of
employees
and
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
pointed
out
1973
in
the
local
150
operating
engineers
case.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
well,
you
say
it
is
not
for
my
satisfaction
of
the
factor,
mr.
justice
white
but
if
you
mean
what
i.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
well
if
the
court
so
rules
it
does
not
only
attainable,
it
is
the
law
but
before
the
court
has
so
ruled
it
is
my
position
that
the
first
amendment
is
still
a
very
viable
thing,
it
is
still
very
important
in
this
country
and
picketing
is
still
the
exercise
of
the
first
amendment
right.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
it
is,
but
i
was
trying
to
answer
mr.
justice
white
your
question
as
to
a
possible
ruling
on
the
court.
i
would
prefer
the
court
say
that
the
contract
is
enforceable
by
picketing
because
first
amendment
says,
you
have
a
right
to
picket
and
tell
people
about
facts
and
the
taft-hartley
acts
itself
says
so.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
we
could
but
the
problem
your
honor
is
that
this
is
a
small
union.
if
they
have
to
go
to
court
and
legally
enforce
every
violation,
you
are
going
to
overburden
the
courts
which
mr.
chief
justice
has
already
pointed
out,
greatly
overburden
their
work,
you
are
going
to
encourage
delay
in
litigious
processes
and
if
it
is
legal
to
have
such
a
contract
and
if
an
employer
breaks
such
a
contract
and
it
is
an
enforceable
contract,
why
can
not
the
union
just
have
a
man
and
this
only
one
man
peacefully
were
to
sign
saying,
the
company
violates
the
agreement.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
absent,
absent
the
contract
in
this
case,
of
course
not,
that
would
be
recognitional
picketing
and
hand
picketing.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
with
all
due
respect
mr.
justice
white.
i
said
he
had
already
recognized
it.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
yes
sir.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
well,you
are
taking
an
arbitrary
time
and
certainly
economic
pressure
and
if
i
read
your
question
mr.
chief
justice
burger
correctly
about
withstanding,
a
union
is
entitled
to
bring
certain
kind
of
economic
pressure
where
picketing
is
legal.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
i
prefer
the
picketing
for
the
reasons
your
honor
stated.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
because
your
honor
the
board
has
consistently
ruled
in
the
oilfield
research
cases
and
in
other
cases
and
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
that
where
picketing
has
been
conducted
by
a
union
who
already
signed
a
contract,
it
is
not
recognitional
picketing
because
recognitional
picketing
only
applies
to
the
initial
attempt
for
the
union
to
gain
that
recognition.
we
cite
at
page
11
of
our
brief
the
dallas
case
and
i
quote
from
the
court
of
appeals
language
there
in
1968
that
the
board
itself
there,
the
board
correctly
points
out
that
section
8
(b)(7)(a)
is
aimed
only
at
a
labor
organizations
picketing
to
gain
recognition
for
the
first
time,
not
picketing
designed
to
retain
its
representative
status.
so
under
the
board's
own
prior
decisions
and
we
cite
them
in
our
brief
the
bay
counties
case,
the
sullivan
electric
company
case.
the
board
is
previously
and
repeatedly
ruled,
court
of
appeals
has
ruled
that
picketing
such
as
that
in
the
case
at
even
arguendo
it
was
for
collective
bargaining
purposes
was
not
within
the
prohibition
of
8
(b)(7)(a).
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
it
is
a
very
sharp
question
mr.
justice
stevens
and
i
not
sure
to
answer
that
because
it
would
appear
to
me
in
the
first
place
that
it
could
be
argued
that
once
the
employer
breaches
the
contract
and
it
is
no
longer
controlling
there
is
a
termination
of
the
recognition
of
the
union
and
of
the
union
then
pickets,
if
the
contract
is
invalid
the
union
is
then
picketing
to
get
recognitional
status
for
the
first
time.
if
the
contract
is
invalid,
the
union
was
recognize
because
the
union
could
not
be
recognized
by
a
contract
unless
it
is
a
valid
contract.
so
therefore,
i
would
say
that
the
validity
of
the
contract
is
controlling
in
that
case.
but
i
have
not
thought
that
through,
that
is
my
initial
reactions.
so
therefore
my
point
there
is
that
the
board's
interpretation
encourages
employers
to
discriminate
against
union
members
to
make
people
drop
union
membership
as
a
condition
of
employment
in
order
to
prevent
the
union
from
getting
a
majority
status
and
thereby
saying
we
can
avoid
binding
effect
of
a
contract.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
i
believe
so
mr.
justice
stewart
but
i
am
not
positive.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
right
sir
but
the
--.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
right
sir
and
the
only
consistent
explanation
of
that
we
submit
to
the
court
is
the
explanation
that
we
in
our
brief
that
8
(f)
carves
out
an
exception
to
the
usual
rules,
the
9
(a)
rule,
the
8
(b)(7)
rule.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
right
sir.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
yes
sir,
is
opposition
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
the
two
court
of
appeals,
third
circuit
in
district
of
columbia
that
it
would
be
an
exercise
on
futility
and
it
is
can
concede
that
congress
would
go
to
say
that
a
8
(f)
contract
with
the
minority
so
to
speak
union
before
the
union
has
achieved
its
majority.
it
is
legal
and
yet
it
can
not
be
enforced.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
yes
sir,
the
employer
refused
to
play
the
wages
and
wage
scale
and
the
contributions
to
the
welfare
and
pension
funds
that
the
employer
had
agreed
to
pay
in
its
contract.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
no
there
was
nothing
to
bargain
mr.
justice
white.
the
bargaining
was
accomplished
when
the
contract
is
signed.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
but
on
the
other
hand,
excuse
me,
i
suppose
it
can
be
argued
that
when
an
employer
breaches
a
contract
it
is
refusing
to
bargain.
i
have
no
strong
opinion.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
all
of
the
employees
including
the
nonunion
employees.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
there
were
several
questions
there
and
i
may
answer
them
some
of
these
jobs
are
of
short
duration
but
if
the
question
is
who
may
you
hire
when
you
start.
if
an
employer
does
not
want
to
hire
union
members
or
does
it
want
to
pay
the
wages
in
hour
and
working
conditions
that
have
been
developed
to
protect
the
employees
over
the
years,
it
does
not
have
to
sign
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
or
even
if
you
have
an
employer
then
some
of
the
jobs
last
for
a
long
time.
there
is
several
going
on
already,
and
now
with
the
constructing
power
houses
and
that
which
last
for
two
and
three
years.
the
reason
nobody
files
an
election
is
the
union
represents
a
majority
of
employees.
the
employer
and
the
union
agreed
on
these
wages
hours
and
working
conditions
and
everybody
is
happy
about
it.
it
is
arm's
length
bargaining
and
the
senate
report,
the
committee
report
again
points
out
that
these
contracts
themselves
are
for
a
long
period
because
that
gives
stability
in
the
construction
industry.
if
a
new
contract
had
to
be
signed
for
every
particular
job
it
would
lead
to
endless
negotiations
and
so
forth.
so
i
do
not
know
if
that
answers
your
question.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
mr.
justice
stevens,
the
employer
does
not
have
to
sign
an
areawide
agreement.
there
are
many
project
agreements
that
are
signed
and
in
some
of
the
cases
which
are
cited
in
the
briefs
there
were
project
agreement
signed
rather
than
areawide
agreements.
so
whether
the
employer
signs
an
areawide
agreements,
depend
on
whether
he
is
going
to
be
in
the
business
in
that
area
over
a
long
period
of
time.
it
depends
on
the
facts.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
the
problem
with
the
--
another
problem
with
the
board's
position
as
i
say
is
not
only
that
it
would
and
does
encourage
unfair
labor
practices
as
shown
by
this
case,
by
the
local
150
case
and
by
the
d.c.
that's
dee
cee
case
cited
by
the
board
is
the
fact
to
that
it
would
create
a
lot
--
it
would
open
a
pandora's
box
as
far
as
administration
under
the
act
and
it
would
require
and
employer
who
signs
an
agreement
with
employee.
the
employer
says
you
do
not
have
a
majority.
the
union
says
we
do
have
a
majority.
if
the
union
files
does
it
have
to
file
an
unfair
labor
practice.
does
it
have
to
file
for
an
election.
the
act
is
silent
on
all
that
whereas
the
act
gives
the
explicit
remedy
that
anytime
the
employer
or
an
employee
feels
that
the
union
is
not
representing
majority
of
the
employees
they
can
petition
for
the
election.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
mr.
justice
white,
what
do
you
mean
by
this
is
not
something
new?
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
as
far
as
section
8
(f)
is
concerned
it
is.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
yes
in
r.
j.
smith.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
well
it
had
not
been
the
board's
consistent
positions
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
as
the
amicus
brief
points
out
in
oilfield
research
and
in
other
cases,
the
board
has
held
that
an
8
(f)
contract
is
a
valid
contract
even
though
the
union
did
not
establish
its
majority
position.
there
was
no
--.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
and
i
submit
mr.
justice
white,
the
board
was
previously
wrong
on
that.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
they
do
but
i
don't
think
their
distinction
is
valid
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
their
distinction
of
oilfield
maintenance,
they
say
in
their
reply
brief
that
case
has
been
expressly
limited
by
the
board
to
its
particular
circumstances.
there
is
no
board
case
that
has
that
language.
they
said
there
that
the
board
has
declined
to
extend
that
decision
to
the
kind
of
8
(f)
agreements
involved
in
this
case.
that
is
misleading.
the
8
(f)
agreement
in
this
case
is
the
same
as
the
8
(f)
agreement
in
the
oilfield
maintenance.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
well,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
the
argument
would
then
be
over
extend.
i
would
say
it
is
a
an
instance
of
the
board
refusing
to
follow
oilfield,
not
extended
because
it
is
directly
contradictory.
so
i
do
not
regard
that
as
extension
but
aside
from
that
it
is
just
court's
function.
we
respectfully
submit
to
construe
of
the
act
and
the
board
has
has
been
wrong
five
times.
it
was
wrong
in
r.
j.
smith.
it
was
wrong
in
local
150,
the
operating
engineers
it
was
wrong
and
this
dee
cee
case
in
construing
8
(f)
of
the
act
to
make
it
a
nullity.
what
good
is
the
contract
if
it
is
not
enforceable.
i
mean
you
are
dealing
with
people.
people
who
work
for
living
in
that
and
i
would
hate
to
go
out
and
talk
to
my
clients.
guys,
where
iron
work
is
to
put
up
buildings,
they
work
with
their
hands
for
living
and
say,
look
your
business
agent
signed
the
contract
with
this
employer
but
the
contract
is
worth
the
paper
it
is
printed
on,
if
the
employer
does
not
want
to
enforce
it.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
that
is
correct.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
but
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
language
in
the
committee
report
indicates
that
the
purpose
of
that
is
to
legitimatize
and
sanction
and
encourage,
encourage
the
reaching
of
collective
bargaining
agreements
in
the
construction
industry
which
is
sue
generis.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
but
as
i
submit
that
is
all
the
act
had
to
say
was
what
it
says.
i
mean
if
you
have
a
contract
or
you
do
not
a
contract
and
i
submit
that.
mr.
sydney
l.
berger
but
we
submit
that
that
question
depends
on
whether
you
have
a
valid
contract
or
not,
therefore
we
submit
that
in
this
particular
case,
the
only
reasonable
interpretation
of
section
8
(f)
is
to
provide
that
when
the
congress
--.
