mr.
berger
let
me
follow
up
on
justice
white's
question.
i
am
not
completely
sure
as
i
understand
your
answer.
he
was
asking
by
if
i
follow
your
dialog
correctly,
whether
it
was
possible
that
the
contract
might
be
a
valid
enforceable
contract
but
nevertheless
you
might
have
violated
section
8
(b)(7)
by
picketing
to
enforce
it
because
reading
8
(b)(7)
in
a
very
literal
way.
how
do
you
get
around
just
the
literal
language
of
8
(b)(7),
why
does
not
the
language
apply
to
your
situation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
let
me
ask
the
opposite
of
the
question.
if
your
argument
is
valid
would
it
not
equally
be
valid
even
if
the
contract
is
invalid.
if
they
are
not
quite
seeking
to
get
their
first
recognition
they
are
seeking
really
to
maintain
a
recognition
they
had
even
though
the
status
before
was
not
as
a
party
to
a
valid
contract,
they
still
were
doing
something
lawful.
is
the
validity
to
contract
and
controlling
importance
is
it
what
i
am
trying
to
figure
out.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
berger
would
you
come
in
on
one
of
the
practical
aspect
that
i
want
to
really
understand
here.
it
occurs
to
me
that
these
contracts
have
short
duration
in
time
because
the
jobs
are
completed
relatively
quickly.
is
it
a
practical
solution
for
any
of
the
interested
parties
to
go
for
an
election
because
election
takes
even
just
a
couple
of
weeks.
maybe
the
job
will
be
completed
is,
is
this
why
nobody
ever
seeks
the
election
if
the
contracts
do
not
take
long
enough
to
perform
and
is
not
perhaps
then
the
real
question
is
who
may
you
hire
when
you
start
the
job
rather
than
what
remedy
maybe
available
after
a
couple
of
weeks
are
gone
by.
justice
john
paul
stevens
one
other
thing
that
occurs
to
me,
it
helps
me.
i
am
just
--
i
find
this
very
puzzling
case.
one
other
problems,
i
suppose
is
that
in
order
to
get
the
first
job
signed
up,
he
is
got
to
sign
an
areawide
agreement
and
then
the
problem
arises
in
the
subsequent
jobs
when
he
--
but
he
can
not
do
it
on
a
simply
a
job-by-job
basis
when
the
union
represents
whole
territory
like
this.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
