justice
potter
stewart
if
that
is
correct
then,
as
my
brother
stevens
has
indicated,
you
would
owe
no
tax
under
the
iowa
statute
and
yet
you
voluntarily
paid
the
tax,
did
you
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
have
paid
the
tax,
based
on
the
three
factor
formula?
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
not
increase
their
iowa
taxes
and
it
would
presumably
reduce
their
illinois
taxes
so
why
is
my
brother
marshall
not
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
they
would
not
increase
their
iowa
tax?
justice
potter
stewart
moving
their
factory
to
iowa,
they
came
out
ahead,
would
they
not,
is
not
my
brother
marshall
exactly
right?
