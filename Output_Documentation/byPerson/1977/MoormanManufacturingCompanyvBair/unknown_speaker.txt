unknown
speaker
how
can
it
be,
as
a
taxing
agency,
it
is
already
they
set
up
a
different
formula?
unknown
speaker
they
do,
and
they
then
compute
tax
on
some
three
factor
or
other
formulas?
unknown
speaker
mr.
barnes,
you
argued
the
general
motors
case,
did
you
not?
unknown
speaker
your
basic
constitutional
claim
as
i
understand
it
mr.
barnes
is
that
what
iowa
has
done,
results
in
the
double
taxation
of
interstate
commerce?
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
sales
factor,
just
the
taxes,
income
earned
in
another
states?
unknown
speaker
you
would
be
making
the
same
argument,
i
take
it
if
this
tax
rate
were
Â½
or
1%
or
100
to
1%?
unknown
speaker
yes
but
why
should
not
a
reasonable
question
be
here,
whether
or
not
a
state
is
extracting
from
moorman
a
reasonable
return
for
what
it
does
for
moorman?
unknown
speaker
no,
1000,
so
1%
rate,
you
would
not
say
that
it
was
more
that
what
iowa
is
doing
for
moorman?
unknown
speaker
well,
unless
you
say
the
constitutional
principle
is
that
interstate
commerce
and
moorman
have
to
pay
their
way
and
the
state
can
unless
somebody
can
show
this
state
is
extracting
too
much,
for
what
it
is
giving
that
this
tax
is
constitutional?
unknown
speaker
let
us
say
the
iowa
people
who
are
exporting
and
manufacturing
and
exporting
are
paying
property
taxes
and
everything
else
in
iowa?
unknown
speaker
the
total
tax
burden
imposed
by
iowa
may
be
greater
than
moormans
for
all
you
know?
unknown
speaker
it
is
true
is
it
not
general
that
your
single
formula
does
benefit
your
iowa
manufacturers
and
this
i
take
it
is
why
we
have
an
amicus
brief
from
deer
&
co
and
maytag
and
others
who
ship
out
of
the
state?
unknown
speaker
their
headquarters
are,
but
you
have
an
iowa
establishment,
do
you
not
in
monsanto?
unknown
speaker
we
certainly
do
if
deer
&
co
at
the
quad
cities
on
the
iowa
side.
unknown
speaker
and
this
is
why
they
are
in
favor
of
the
single
sales
formula.
unknown
speaker
if
there
is
an
answer.
unknown
speaker
well,
this
is
a
legitimate
question.
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
suggesting
that
mr.
barnes
necessarily
will
prevail
here,
but
i
am
just
wondering
if
the
so
called
iowa
formula
on
the
single
factor
is
not
the
result
of
the
legislative
response
to
iowa
manufacturing?
unknown
speaker
so
having
practiced
in
the
neighboring
state,
they
were
adopted
in
these
times
of
tax
laws
of
that
time
and
they
were
fairly
simple
and
they
wanted
single
factors.
iowa
never
has
pressed
beyond
that
point
i
suppose
because
it
is
helpful
to
them.
i
am
not
saying
that
is
unconstitutional.
unknown
speaker
you
have
a
property
tax
in
iowa?
unknown
speaker
they
would
pay
then
iowa
property?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
in
the
moorman
would
be
better
off
or
have
a
better
chance
of
winning
this
case
if
it
had
put
some
accountants
on
the
stand
and
proved
by
cost
accounting
that
part
of
its
net
profit
is
attributable
to
its
manufacturing
operations
in
illinois,
that
was
hans
rees,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
general,
iowa
has
not
joined
in
the
multistate
tax
commission
yet?
unknown
speaker
nor
have
you
been
in
and
out
of
it
as
some
states
have?
unknown
speaker
could
i
just
pursue
that
again,
that
we
had
an
exchange
about
this
before
lunch,
but
if
there
had
been
a
cost
accounting
evidence
that
part
of
the
profit
was
assignable
to
illinois
manufacturing,
and
assume
that
it
was
uncontradicted,
what
would
you
say
then,
could
you
still
use
the
sales
formula?
