let
us
put
it
in
another
way,
would
not
moorman
be
better
off
if
they
moved
their
factory
to
iowa?
justice
thurgood
marshall
really!
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
i
gather
from
your
reluctance
to
answer
my
question
that
if
you
did
answer
that
it
would
be
better
off
and
you
would
lose
your
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no
sir,
i
said
do
i
assume
that
if
you
answer
my
question
yes,
you
would
lose
your
case
and
that
is
why
you
did
not
say
yes?
you
might
answer
it.
