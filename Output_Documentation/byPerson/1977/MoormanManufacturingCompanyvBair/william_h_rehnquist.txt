justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
that
all
the
states
that
are
pertinent,
you
mean
the
ones
in
which
your
client
is
subject
to
taxation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
saying
that
because
so
many
other
states
have
adopted
the
three
factor
formula,
iowa
is
under
constitutional
mandate
to
do
the
same
thing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
supposing
every
state
in
the
union
had
adopted
iowa?s
formula,
could
you
make
the
same
argument
that
you
are
making
now
that
iowa?s
formula
is
unconstitutional?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
wrong
state?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
certainly,
there
would
be
some
nexus
between
the
taxes
collected
and
the
earning
of
income.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
have
got
to
show
that
iowa's
proposed
measure
is
unconstitutional
not
just
that
you
do
not
like
it
or
that
you
would
have
done
something
else
if
you
were
a
legislator.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
again
is
a
constitutional
argument
i
take
it
and
not
just
an
economics
argument?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
precisely
how
does
this
double
taxation
as
you
refer
to
it
take
place?
how
do
you
define
double
taxation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
that
if
the
same
income
is
attributed
to
more
than
one
state,
it
is
double
taxation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
case
supports
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
freeman
v.
hewitt
is
still
good
law
after
our
recent
decisions
in
the
last
two
or
three
years?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
much
latitude
do
you
think
the
constitution
allows
the
various
states
in
using
one,
two
or
three
formulas
and
in
weighting
the
formula?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
other
words,
iowa?s
constitutional
right
to
tax
or
the
constitutional
limitations
on
iowa?s?
power
to
tax
is
affected
by
the
means
chosen
by
other
states?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
would
have
thought
that
every
state
enactment
was
presumed
constitutional?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
why
does
iowa
have
the
burden
of
proof?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
do
you
think
if
neither
party
had
introduced
evidence
in
the
recent
wisconsin
case,
the
wisconsin
statute
would
it
have
been
struck
down
because
wisconsin
had
the
burden
of
proof
to
show
it
was
constitutional?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
iowa's
tax
rate
was
1%
and
it
had
a
single
factor
formula
and
illinois?
tax
rate
were
15%,
but
it
had
a
three
factor
formula,
would
your
answer
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
iowa?s
statutes
still
be
the
same?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
mean
by
facial
constitutionality?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
really
over
breadth
you
are
talking
about,
is
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
is
only
going
to
apply
in
the
first
amendment
area,
has
it
not?
why
do
you
need
to
wrestle
with
facial
constitutionality
at
all
when
you
are
talking
about
a
tax
statute
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
free
speech?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
did
not
have
to
buy
that,
did
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
griger,
what
you
do
understand
justice
white?s
phrase
traceable
to
illinois
manufacturing
to
mean
when
you
answered
his
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
your
understand
as
such
a
finding
by
a
trial
judge
that
if
1/3
of
the
income
is
?due
to?
manufacturing
in
the
illinois
to
mean
economically?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
take
it,
for
instance,
when
you
are
talking
about
the
production
of
copper
wire,
you
have
copper
that
may
have
been
mined
in
arizona
and
utah,
smelted
in
el
paso,
refined
somewhere
else
and
made
into
wires
still
somewhere
else.
it
would
hard
to
describe
?due
to?
finding
to
any
one
of
those
activities?
