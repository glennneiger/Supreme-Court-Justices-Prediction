justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
barnes,
i
just
have
one
question
there.
if
the
statute
is
unconstitutional,
why
do
you
owe
any
tax?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
why
did
you
have
to
pay
any
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
say
that
the
constitution
mandates
the
three-partite
formula
that
you
used
in
filling
out
your
returns?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
barnes,
supposing
you
had
a
neighboring
state,
next
to
iowa
that
had
a
two
factor
formula,
payroll
and
property
and
iowa
had
the
one
factor
formula
sales,
would
both
statutes
be
unconstitutional
and
say
all
the
goods
are
manufactured
in
the
two
factor
formula
state
and
shipped
into
the
one
factor
formula
state,
would
both
statutes
be
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
they
would
both
be
bad.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
barnes,
what
i
am
asking
is
does
your
argument
rest
on
the
overlap
where
you
get
to
and
which
seems
to
me
would
make
both
statutes
unconstitutional
or
are
you
arguing
quite
a
different
argument
that
the
sales
factor
just
is
not
justifiable
because
there
is
not
enough
activity
in
the
state?
if
you
are
arguing
overlap,
i
do
not
see
what
difference
it
makes
which
factor
you
use.
anyone
would
be
unconstitutional
if
it
is
not
the
same
as
the
neighboring
state?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
does
not
your
overlap
argument
apply
equally
to
both
states?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
are
you
then
saying
that
if
every
state
in
the
country
used
a
purely
sales
method,
every
state
statute
would
be
unconstitutional
and
then
you
do
not
have
to
rely
on
overlap
at
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
have
got
two
quite
different
theories
and
i
am
trying
to
understand
which
one
you
are
really
resting
on.
one
is
an
overlap
double
taxation
theory,
the
other
is
that
sales
is
not
any
good
no
matter
how
it
is
done
and
which
is
your
principle
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
barnes,
does
the
record
tell
us
what
the
tax
rates
were
and
how
much
and
how
heavy
a
tax
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
it
would
be
unconstitutional
to
impose
a
10%
sales
tax
on
--?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
second
text,
the
second
case
coming
from
iowa
involves
the
constitutionality
of
iowa's
formula
for
determining
what
portion
of
the
income
of
an
interstate
business
shall
be
subject
to
tax
in
iowa.
under
iowa's
formula,
the
portion
that
is
taxed
by
that
state
is
measured
by
the
portion
of
the
gross
sales
made
in
the
--
the
portion
of
the
total
sales
made
by
the
corporation
which
take
place
within
the
state.
for
reasons
stated
in
the
opinion,
which
we
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
uphold
the
validity
of
this
tax
noting
that
if
the
commerce
problems
that
raises
can
effectively
be
dealt
with
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states
if
it
wishes
to
remove
the
risk
of
multiple
taxation
that
this
sort
of
statute
does
create.
there
have
been
three
dissenting
opinions
filed
in
this
case;
one
by
justice
powell,
one
by
justice
brennan
and
one
by
justice
blackmun.
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
also
joined
mr.
justice
powell's
opinion.
