mr.
harry
m.
griger
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issues
today
as
far
as
the
constitutionality
of
the
iowa
corporate
income
tax
scheme
resolved
itself
around
the
due
process
clause
and
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
commerce
clause.
sub
issues
are
facial
constitutionality
of
the
iowa
tax
scheme
on
its
face
and
then
if
it
is
constitutional
in
its
face,
whether
or
not
it
has
been
constitutionally
applied
to
moorman
manufacturing
company.
mr.
harry
m.
griger
i
believe
that
facial
constitutionality
means
that
it
must
be
unconstitutional
under
all
conceivable
circumstances.
if
it
simply
has
a
possibility
of
being
unconstitutional
some
of
the
time
or
under
some
conceivable
circumstances,
i
believe
that
should
be
a
applied
issue.
mr.
harry
m.
griger
yes,
i
believe
the
whole
case
is
over
breadth.
mr.
harry
m.
griger
no,
maybe
i
am
being
misunderstood.
when
this
case
began,
moorman
basically
put
into
issue
that
the
iowa
sales
factor
is
invalid,
under
any
conceivable
circumstances.
mr.
harry
m.
griger
no,
we
do
not
and
our
trial
judge
in
iowa
held
that
it
was
unconstitutional
under
all
conceivable
circumstances.
our
iowa
supreme
court
which
we
believe
correctly
met
the
issue
said
no,
there
is
no
showing,
it
can
be
facially
unconstitutional
because
it
is
not
facially
unconstitutional
under
all
circumstances
and
secondly
as
to
this
particular
taxpayer,
there
has
been
no
proof
of
unconstitutionality.
but
what
i
am
saying
is
as
far
as
the
facial
due
process
issue,
this
would
mean
that
no
matter
what
the
circumstances,
the
iowa
single
sales
factor
formula
would
automatically
cause
extraterritorial
taxation,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
regardless
of
the
circumstances.
i
believe
that
is
what
moorman
is
saying.
that
is
not
our
position,
we
do
not
think
they
have
proved
that
in
any
event.
the
iowa
single
sales
factor
formula
in
exploring
this
one
step
further,
applies
not
simply
to
corporations
such
as
moorman
which
manufacture
outside
the
state
of
iowa
and
sell
within.
it
applies
to
retail
merchants,
wholesale
merchants,
in
state
manufacturers,
out
of
state
manufacturers,
manufacturers
manufacturing
in
state
and
out
of
state.
moorman?s
evidence
of
course
was
only
directed
towards
its
own
facts
which
it
agrees
on
page
of
four
of
its
brief
that
that
is
all
the
issues
really
are.
this
as
i
say
suggests
that
this
case
really
involves
the
constitutionality
of
the
iowa
formula
as
applied
to
moorman?s
facts
and
it
is
too
broad
to
say
that
it
involves
an
attack
upon
the
statute
that
as
invalid
under
any
conceivable
circumstances
which
are
not
even
before
the
court
today.
due
process
principles
derived
from
constitutional
apportionment
cases
decided
by
this
court
are
as
follows.
first,
the
statutory
formula
and
the
results
reached
in
its
application
are
presumed
constitutional
and
a
tax
payer
must
show
unconstitutionality
beyond
reasonable
doubt,
rebut
all
reasonable
bases
to
support
the
formula.
second,
the
states
have
great
leeway
in
their
choice
and
application
of
formula.
third,
court
has
never
stricken
an
apportionment
formula
on
its
face.
in
the
100
and
some
odd
years
of
constitutional
history
of
formulas
in
this
country
it
has
never
been
stricken
on
its
face,
but
has
adopted
the
case
by
case
approach,
carefully
reviewing
the
record
in
the
courts
below
to
see
if
the
taxpayer
showed
constitutional
transgression.
a
taxpayer
has
in
this
area
not
merely
the
burden
of
proof,
but
extremely
heavy
burden
of
proof
in
challenging
a
formula?s
constitutionality.
this
generally
requires
a
powerful
evidentiary
showing
against
the
formula
and
not
merely
as
in
this
case,
arguments
of
counsel
and
of
course
precise
apportionment
is
impossible,
rough
approximation
being
sufficient,
the
court
having
long
recognized
that
it
is
generally
impossible
to
specifically
allocate
the
profits
of
a
unitary
business
to
activities
carried
on
in
taxing
state.
now,
an
application
of
these
due
process
principles
to
this
case
for
the
years
in
question,
the
iowa
apportionment
formula
as
applied
to
the
iowa
computed
net
income
tax
base
showed
that
moorman
earned
from
about
21.9
or
22%
of
its
income
in
iowa
to
about
18.7%
for
the
five
years
in
question.
this
is
stipulated
and
there
is
really
no
dispute
as
to
the
fact
that
the
formula
shows
that.
we
believe
that
moorman
was
required
to
show
to
satisfy
its
burden
of
proof
that
the
iowa
law
was
unconstitutional,
that
they
did
not
earn
that
amount,
but
they
earned
a
substantially
lesser
amount.
now,
the
only
evidence
in
this
case
in
the
stipulated
data,
there
were
no
witnesses,
we
have
stipulated
data
in
this
case,
consisted
of
mere
comparison
of
the
results
reached
by
moorman?s
three
factor
formula
which
is
about
12.2
to
14.5%
of
its
income
in
iowa
and
of
course
the
iowa
formula
listing
the
percentages
that
i
mentioned.
in
other
words,
we
have
a
comparison
of
one
estimate
with
another
estimate
with
no
evidence
in
the
case
which
estimate
may
be
right
or
which
estimate
may
be
wrong.
for
all
that
appears
in
this
case,
we
have
actually
undertaxed
moorman.
mr.
harry
m.
griger
i
might
point
out
deer
&
co,
maytag
is
quite
local,
they
manufacture
washing
machines,
monsanto
is
located
is
located
in
st.
louis,
most
of
those
--
mr.
harry
m.
griger
i
believe
they
do
have
an
iowa
plant,
but
most
of
their
manufacturing
is
outside
of
state.
mr.
harry
m.
griger
deer
has
manufacturing
both
in
iowa
and
illinois,
yes
sir.
mr.
harry
m.
griger
in
other
words,
how
do
you
answer
mr.
barnes
argument
that
you
are
not
favoring
the
exporters
at
the
cost
of
the
importers?
mr.
harry
m.
griger
first
of
all,
the
only
answer
i
can
think
of
giving
on
a
particular
question
like
that
was
that
you
are
talking
about
a
theory.
mr.
harry
m.
griger
i
am
not
saying
it
is
not.
we
are
talking
about
a
theory.
the
same
question
cropped
up
in
prior
i
believe
anyway
they
propped
up,
in
prior
apportionment
cases
decided
by
this
court
involving
single
property
factors
cases.
there
of
course,
the
formula
would
tax
the
total
segment
income
if
you
accept
the
theory
of
a
company
manufacturing
in
the
state
whereas
it
gives,
theoretically
in
the
formula,
it
does
not
take
into
account
what
is
going
on
in
the
state
of
sale.
now,
mr.
barnes
is
saying
the
same
thing
insofar
as
this
case.
i
believe
however,
that
the
iowa
tax
is
triggered
and
is
applied
against
corporations
who
sell
in
the
iowa
marketplace
and
if
they
do
that,
they
become
subject
to
the
iowa
corporate
income
tax.
mr.
harry
m.
griger
your
honor,
the
formula
was
adopted
in
1934.
why
it
was
adopted,
i
honestly
do
not
know.
back
at
that
period
of
time,
there
were
certainly
i
think
as
mr.
barnes
brought
out
in
the
brief,
back
around
1929,
there
were
the
basic
formula
effect
at
that
time
or
the
single
properties
and
the
single
sales.
mr.
harry
m.
griger
no,
in
trying
to
answer
your
questions
a
little
bit
difficult
for
me
to
point
out
why
we
would
want
to
do
it.
our
iowa
based
companies,
iowa
manufacturer
who
sells
totally
in
iowa
or
sells
very
little
out
of
iowa
certainly
gets
no
legislative
benefit.
mr.
harry
m.
griger
i
do
not
think
we
know
that.
this
assumes
that
they
are
having
--
mr.
harry
m.
griger
no,
i
do
not
think
we
do.
that
would
assume
for
example
that
they
are
earning
substantial
income
out
of
their
manufacturing
activity.
there
is
no
evidence
of
that,
in
this
particular
record
anyway.
for
all
that
the
record
shows
here,
they
could
be
earning
a
great
deal
of
money
on
their
iowa
sales
activity
more
than
we
are
taxing
and
moving
their
factory
to
iowa
might
not
have
any
effect
insofar
as
their
overall
tax
liability
is
concerned,
but
it
does
not
mean
that
what
we
are
doing
right
now
is
wrong.
mr.
harry
m.
griger
well,
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
question
that
would
reduce
their
illinois
taxes
and
--
mr.
harry
m.
griger
no,
unless
they
increase
their
iowa
sales,
but
assuming
everything
remained
constant
--
mr.
harry
m.
griger
i
do
not
know
if
they
would
come
out
ahead
that
assumes
that
--
mr.
harry
m.
griger
okay
from
an
economic
standpoint,
yes.
mr.
harry
m.
griger
yes
sir,
one
of
the
highest
in
the
country.
mr.
harry
m.
griger
certainly,
yes.
mr.
harry
m.
griger
they
might.
mr.
harry
m.
griger
they
could
very
well.
mr.
harry
m.
griger
would
iowa
be
better
off
we
lose
our
case?
no.
mr.
harry
m.
griger
no,
i
want
to
answer
your
question,
your
honor
and
let
me
put
it
like
this
if
i
may
rely
on
a
prior
case,
the
hans
rees
case
in
which
a
taxpayer
came
in
and
actually
was
able
to
break
down
the
components
of
his
profit
and
show
that
the
formula
of
a
single
property
in
that
case
just
was
not
any
good
and
it
over
reached.
now,
if
moorman
can
make
the
same
showing,
fine.
we
would
like
this
case
to
simply
be
treated
as
the
court
has
been
treating
apportionment
cases
for
a
number
of
years
in
a
case
by
case
basis.
in
other
words,
there
is
a
case
for
example,
kent
coffee
where
99%
of
the
income
was
taxed
by
the
manufacturing
state.
now,
would
that
taxpayer
be
better
off
if
it
moved
out
of,
in
that
case
north
carolina,
maybe
so,
but
that
did
not
make
the
statute
unconstitutional
in
the
absence
of
proof.
mr.
harry
m.
griger
yes,
hans
rees
did
involve
i
believe
a
cost
accounting
where
the
evidence
was
not
rebutted
by
the
state.
as
a
lawyer
and
not
being
an
accountant
or
an
economist,
i
would
have
to
talk
to
my
own
witnesses
and
we
may
very
well
generate
some
type
of
a
jury
question
for
lack
of
a
better
description
of
it,
although
it
would
decided
in
our
case
by
a
judge
as
to
whether
or
not
they
have
proved
the
case.
but
yes,
if
we
were
dealing
with
the
hans
rees
situation
here,
we
would
be
dealing
with
a
far
different
situation
than
what
we
are
dealing
with
now.
mr.
harry
m.
griger
no,
we
have
not
joined
it
for
neither
a
regular
member
nor
an
associate
member.
i
think
they
have
19
regular
and
13
associate
members.
mr.
harry
m.
griger
no,
we
have
not.
no
sir,
not
at
all.
we
believe
that
the
cornerstone
of
moorman?s
argument
in
the
whole
case
where
they
talk
about
due
process,
equal
protection
and
interstate
commerce,
rests
upon
abstract
argument
of
counsel
that
iowa
necessarily
taxed
100%
of
moorman?s
income
from
iowa
sales
of
goods
manufactured
in
illinois.
we
disagree
that
moorman
showed
that
iowa
so
taxes
100%
of
such
income
and
implicated
the
facial
validity
of
the
iowa
formula.
mr.
harry
m.
griger
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
the
recess,
i
was
getting
into
moorman?s
contention
that
100%
of
their
income
was
necessarily
taxed
by
iowa,
that
is
income
that
they
derive
from
selling
goods
in
iowa
which
goods
were
manufactured
in
illinois.
one
of
the
points
i
would
like
to
make
in
this
regard
is
there
is
a
total
lack
of
evidence
in
this
record
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
any
manufacturing
profit
in
illinois.
such
lack
of
evidence
was
held
to
be
a
fatal
defect
by
this
court
in
the
bass
case,
the
underwood
case,
kent
coffee
cases,
all
involving
single
property
factor
formulas.
mr.
harry
m.
griger
one
of
the
things
i
would
want
to
know
is
how
much
because
in
this
sense,
the
states
are
allowed
rough
approximation.
if
they
had
manufacturing
profit
for
example
that
we
were
trying
to
tax
out
of
all
reasonable
proportion
to
business
done.
mr.
harry
m.
griger
of
course,
they
could
prove
it.
i
think
we
are
getting
into
a
hans
rees
type
situation
that
is
breaking
down
the
component
parts
of
the
business
to
show
income.
mr.
harry
m.
griger
well,
i
think
this
is
what
extraterritorial
taxation
is
all
about
is
trying
to
over
reach
beyond
the
state.
the
states
have
been
granted
some
leeway
in
this
area.
mr.
harry
m.
griger
as
i
understand
there
may
not
be
able
to
be
a
precise
apportionment
to
illinois,
but
it
may
be
a
situation
like
hans
rees
where
the
evidence
different,
i
think
it
was
between
17
and
21%
earned
in
the
state
of
north
carolina
in
that
case
where
as
the
formula
attributed
80
some
percent
to
north
carolina.
mr.
harry
m.
griger
no,
i
believe
this
court?s
scope
--
mr.
harry
m.
griger
if
a
finding
could
be
made,
i
am
not
an
accountant
or
an
economist
and
i
might
want
to
consult
my
own
expert
witnesses.
mr.
harry
m.
griger
i
think
what
you
are
saying
is
basically
the
hans
rees
situation
and
yes,
the
court
has
already
held
that
would
be
inappropriate.
mr.
harry
m.
griger
if
we
can
break
the
business
down
into
its
components
that
he
would
actually
be
making
a
finding
in
that
hans
rees
that
the
income
can
be
directly
traceable
to
that
activity.
now,
generally
this
cannot
be
done
in
the
unitary
business.
from
cpas
i
have
talked
to
in
our
department
of
revenue
in
iowa,
they
say
it
cannot
be
done.
mr.
harry
m.
griger
as
i
understand
it
that
it
would
be.
i
think
we
were
assuming
hypothetically,
it
could
be
done.
i
do
not
know
that
it
can
be
done.
but
if
it
could
be,
then
i
think
we
have
a
burden
of
going
forward
with
our
own
evidence.
maybe
we
can
attack
that
finding
and
show
that
it
is
based
on
faulty
premises,
but
as
i
understood
his
question,
if
it
could
be
shown,
then
would
we
be
overreaching
by
taxing
all
that
income.
i
suppose
the
answer
would
yes
because
the
answer
was
yes
in
the
hans
rees
case.
that
is
what
i
least
i
meant
my
answer
to
be.
i
believe
that
this
court
has
also
held
and
correctly
so
in
ford
motor
company
v.
beauchamp
that
constitutionality
of
state
taxation
ought
not
to
turn
upon
so
narrow
an
issue
as
to
whether
local
assets
rather
than
local
gross
receipts
are
used
in
an
apportionment
formula.
the
presumption
of
constitutionality
must
in
this
type
of
a
case,
in
apportionment
cases
must
be
overcome
by
evidence
and
not
by
the
argument
of
counsel
to
satisfy
the
heavy
burden
of
proof.
i
would
like
to
get
on
now
into
the
argument
in
this
case
involving
interstate
commerce.
now
again,
as
far
as
the
iowa
statute
is
concerned,
the
basic
argument
of
moorman
which
is
that
the
iowa
formula
is
bad
per
se,
means
that
it
must
necessarily
regardless
of
the
facts
cause
multiple
taxation
to
be
visited
upon
moorman
or
anybody
else
for
that
matter.
we
believe
that
the
sum
and
substance
of
moorman?s
argument
in
this
regard
is
that
anybody
that
deviates
from
the
three
factor
formula
automatically
creates
multiple
taxation
or
a
risk
of
multiple
taxation.
we
think
moorman?s
argument
is
somewhat
inconsistent
in
that
in
its
brief
at
page
25,
it
says
it
accepts
a
single
property
factor
formula
which
of
course
is
such
a
deviation.
the
argument
also
we
think
assumes
that
you
have
an
easily
definable
tax
base
such
as
what
you
would
have
in
the
gross
receipts
area
where
everybody
can
see
the
gross
receipts
and
that
that
is
what
you
are
apportioning,
that
is
not
true.
what
is
being
apportioned
here
is
net
income.
a
state
like
iowa
offers
what
might
be
called
somewhat
of
a
low
tax
base.
we
do
allow
large
deductions,
including
a
federal
income
tax
deduction.
i
do
not
believe
that
is
allowed
by
the
state
of
illinois
for
example.
it
is
only
allowed
by
about
six
states.
if
moorman?s
argument
were
accepted,
any
formula
that
would
deviate
somehow
from
a
uniform
formula
or
a
tax
base
that
would
be
different,
would
somehow
create
the
risk
of
multiple
taxation,
destroying
the
leeway
states
have
in
this
area,
a
leeway
i
might
add
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court
has
recognized
at
least
in
the
area
of
non
business
income
and
disparate
use
of
combination
corporate
tax
reporting
recently
in
the
us
steel
corporation
vs.
multistate
tax
commission
case
decided
in
february
21.
while
that
case
did
involve
the
compact
clause
of
the
constitution
i
believe
there
were
arguments
made
as
to
interstate
commerce
and
the
court
recognized
that
the
states
did
do
things
differently
but
held
that
that
was
not
necessarily
bad.
of
course,
only
congress
would
have
the
power
in
any
event
to
act
affirmatively
under
the
commerce
clause
and
if
they
wanted
to
impose
upon
all
the
states
a
uniform
apportionment
formula
or
even
a
uniform
tax
base.
the
power
of
taxation.
it
is
the
most
fundamental
power
a
state
can
have
in
fact.
i
would
also
like
to
make
a
few
comments
about
general
motors
v.
district
of
columbia.
i
think
the
parties
here
agreed
that
that
case
did
not
reach
the
constitutional
issues
that
are
being
raised
here.
in
addition,
there
was
no
exclusive
formula
in
that
case
approved
by
the
court.
the
court
read
the
district?s
statute
which
of
course
prescribed
no
formula
as
requiring
one
which
automatically
would
give
effect
to
geographical
spread
of
all
components
of
a
manufacturing
business.
there
was
no
overruling
of
prior
constitutional
case
presence
particularly
the
single
factor
cases
and
the
ford
motor
case
involving
the
very
formula
that
we
have
here
today.
the
case
does
not
implicate
a
taxpayer?s
heavy
burden
of
proof
that
a
statutory
formula
is
unconstitutional
and
we
believe
that
based
upon
this
court?s
reading
of
the
district
statute
in
that
case
that
a
single
property
factor
probably
would
have
been
inconsistent
with
the
statute
insofar
as
applying
it
to
an
integrated
manufacturing
selling
business,
manufacturing
in
one
state
and
selling
goods
in
the
district
of
columbia.
we
believe
that
the
court?s
standards
on
multiple
taxation
should
be
derived
from
the
cases
of
northwest
portland
cement
case
and
also
its
recent
case
in
1975,
the
standard
press
steel
case
in
which
the
court
seems
to
be
going
to
an
actual
burden
and
it
certainly
is
not
a
mere
risk
on
the
basis
of
argument
of
counsel
that
is
an
abstract
notion
of
a
risk
of
multiple
taxation.
for
these
reasons,
we
do
not
feel
that
the
iowa
formula
contravenes
the
commerce
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution.
as
to
facial
equal
protection,
again,
this
involves
that
there
is
necessarily
a
discrimination
against
out
of
state
manufacturers.
no
evidence
on
this
issue
was
introduced,
only
extreme
hypotheticals
were
presented
by
moorman.
it
should
also
be
remembered
that
even
if
there
were
some
companies
along
the
extreme
hypotheticals
moorman
presented
that
as
a
company
manufacturing
totally
out
of
iowa
and
then
selling
in
iowa
or
an
iowa
manufacturer
manufacturing
in
iowa
and
selling
totally
out
of
iowa,
that
iron
rule
of
taxation
is
neither
attainable
nor
required
that
as
this
court
has
held
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
too
rigorous
a
scrutiny
ought
not
to
be
made,
otherwise
all
taxing
schemes
would
fall
since
it
is
impossible
to
define
any
taxing
scheme
or
to
make
one
up
which
has
no
discriminatory
impact
whatsoever.
we
fail
to
see
that
moorman?s
argument
with
reference
to
that
portion
of
its
brief
regarding
constitutionality
as
applied
is
any
different
from
that
portion
of
its
brief
with
reference
to
facial
constitutionality.
the
iowa
supreme
court
agreed
with
this
in
that
regard
and
because
they
held
that
the
iowa
formula
was
not
proven
bad
on
its
face,
they
also
held
that
moorman
did
not
satisfy
its
burden
of
proof
to
overturn
the
formula.
in
conclusion,
we
believe
that
the
decision
of
the
iowa
supreme
court
is
correct
and
that
it
ought
to
be
affirmed
by
this
court.
