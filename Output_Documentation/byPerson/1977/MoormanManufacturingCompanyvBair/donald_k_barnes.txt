mr.
donald
k.
barnes
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
upholding
that
state?s
taxing
scheme
which
has
the
purpose
and
effect
of
imposing
a
tariff
on
imports
while
subsidizing
exports.
the
case
differs
from
general
motors
corporation
v.
district
of
columbia
which
this
court
decided
in
1965,
only
in
irrelevant
factual
details
and
that
the
issue
here
is
purely
constitutional,
whereas
the
court
was
able
to
decide
the
district
of
columbia
case
on
statutory
interpretation.
the
appellant
is
the
moorman
manufacturing
company
which
is
an
illinois
based
corporation
with
a
business
of
manufacturing
animal
feeds
which
it
sells
to
farmers
and
others.
it
has
warehouses
and
salesmen
in
iowa,
but
no
manufacturing
in
that
state.
everything
sold
into
iowa
is
manufactured
in
illinois.
the
corporation
paid
the
iowa
corporate
income
tax
computing
its
apportionable
income
in
the
manner
prescribed
in
the
iowa
statute
as
to
which
there
is
no
dispute
and
then
it
apportioned
that
income,
following
the
three
factor
formula
of
the
uniform
division
of
income
for
tax
purposes
act,
that
is
in
fact
a
formula
of
property,
payroll
and
sales
equally
weighted
with
the
sales
assigned
to
the
destination,
in
this
case
iowa.
the
assessments
are
for
the
difference
between
the
tax
as
such
apportioned
and
the
iowa
formula.
the
iowa
formula
provides
for
a
single
sales
factor
by
destination,
not
attributing
anything
to
either
property
or
payroll.
the
iowa
statute
starts
with
federal
taxable
income
and
makes
certain
adjustments
in
it.
then
having
done
that,
it
applies
a
fraction,
numerator
of
which
is
iowa
sales
and
denominator
sales
to
customers
all
over
to
that
amount
of
total
income
and
this
has
the
effect
of
attributing
to
iowa
all
of
the
income
which
is
derived
from
the
manufacture
in
illinois
and
the
sale
to
customers
in
iowa.
there
was
no
tax
on
income
from
an
iowa
manufacturer
selling
into
illinois.
all
the
facts
are
stipulated
to
total
taxable
income,
the
apportionment
fractions,
any
one
of
the
three
apportionment
fractions,
the
amounts
of
tax
which
will
be
due
if
the
statute
is
held
constitutional
and
also
the
amount
of
tax
which
will
be
due
if
it
is
held
unconstitutional.
so
the
sole
question
in
the
case
is
the
constitutionality
of
a
single
sales
fraction.
the
appellee
agrees
with
that
and
that
appears
in
this
motion
to
dismiss
and
also
in
its
brief.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
we
do
not
owe
any
tax
more
than
we
already
paid?
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
because
mr.
justice
stevens,
the
statute
imposing
tax
is
not
unconstitutional.
the
only
thing
that
is
unconstitutional
is
the
so
called
apportionment
formula.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
no,
mr.
justice
stevens,
we
do
not
call
on
the
court
to
impose
a
formula
or
perform
any
other
legislative
function.
we
merely
say
that
the
single
sales
factor
is
unconstitutional
and
that
is
all
that
the
court
has
asked
to
do.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
i
would
not
go
that
far
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
think
the
statute
is
perfectly
is
valid
except
for
this
apportionment
formula
and
the
statute
not
only
says
that,
i
should
not
say
apportionment,
reasonable
apportionment,
this
single
factor
sales
form
of
attribution
i
think
is
unconstitutional,
but
the
statute
also
says
that
in
the
case
of
interstate
commerce,
the
tax
payer
shall
pay
a
reasonable
portion
and
so
i
think
that
knocking
out
the
formula
does
not
knock
out
the
statute
nor
the
liability.
it
just
leaves
a
question
as
to
how
it
will
be
computed.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
yes,
they
do.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
well,
that
is
what
we
agreed
on,
but
the
statute
almost
all
these
statutes
in
all
states
contain
a
provision
that
if
there
is
something
wrong
with
a
statutory
formula,
the
commissioner
or
the
director
can
work
out
something
that
fits
in
the
particular
case.
a
prime
example
was
the
one
in
california,
the
mcdonald
douglas
case
and
california
statute
provided
that
the
property
factor
is
going
to
consider
only
owned
property.
mcdonald
douglas
owned
a
big
factory
in
california
and
they
leased
a
big
factory
in
another
state.
they
said
it
is
not
fair
to
attribute
all
of
our
property
to
california
when
we
are
using
this
property
in
another
state,
the
california
supreme
court
agreed.
this
was
a
case
in
which
the
statute
was
improper
in
its
application
to
a
particular
case.
so
the
statutes
permit
that
all
along
including
the
iowa
statute.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
that
is
right,
we
did
not
pay
on
the
additional
assessment
and
filed
an
appeal
bond
instead.
all
the
other
states,
including
illinois,
not
all,
but
all
the
ones
that
are
pertinent,
including
illinois
used
this
three
factor
formula
of
property
payroll
and
sales.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
i
made
that
qualification
because
there
are
one
or
two
states
that
while
using
three
factor
formula
apply
some
different
weights
and
there
is
one
state
which
has
adopted
the
only
really
sound
formula
which
is
property
and
payroll
with
no
sales
in
it,
that
is
west
virginia.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
no.
what
we
say
is
that
they
are
under
constitutional
mandate
not
to
adopt
something
different
which
imposes
a
double
tax
on
interstate
commerce.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
yes,
because
the
taxes
would
be
being
paid
all
to
the
wrong
states
which
is
a
due
process
problem.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
there
would
not
be
any
double
taxation
in
that
case,
but
you
still
have
taxes
going
to
places
that
are
unrelated
to
where
the
income
was
earned
and
to
where
the
governmental
services
were
rendered.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
no,
there
is
no
nexus
question
in
this
case.
we
agreed
to
nexus
and
it
could
have
a
very
tiny
nexus
and
the
same
problem
would
arise
and
the
question
is
not
whether
a
tax
is
owed,
but
how
much
and
the
measure
is
entirely
our
problem.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
that
is
right.
i
think
we
have
no
difficulty
with
that.
the
hypothetical
which
this
court
used
in
its
opinion
in
the
general
motors
district
of
columbia
case
is
applicable
here.
assume
that
the
particular
manufacturer
does
all
his
manufacture
in
illinois
and
it
sells
only
to
customers
in
iowa.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
i
did
sir.
you
remember,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
correct
and
i
tried
again,
but
she
would
not
take
it.
i
lost
the
washington,
but
i
won
the
dc.
in
that
situation,
all
manufacture
in
iowa
and
all
customers
in
the
district
of
columbia
are
in
iowa.
illinois
would
tax
2/3
of
the
income
by
applying
its
property
and
payroll
factors.
it
would
not
apply
the
sales
factor
because
the
sales
were
all
outside
the
state
and
iowa
would
tax
100%
of
the
income
because
it
attributes
all
income
to
a
locus
of
the
customer.
that
a
total
of
166%,
as
i
say
that
hypothetical,
i
have
taken
from
gmc
against
district
of
columbia.
now,
this
shows
a
fallacy
of
the
iowa
argument.
they
are
making
the
same
error
that
the
court
of
appeals
made
in
the
gmc
case
because
the
unrelated
income
is
not
taxed,
income
is
apportioned.
the
fact
is
that
100%
of
related
income
is
taxed.
now,
they
say
for
instance,
moorman
has
a
factory
in
texas
that
sells
to
texas
customers,
by
not
taxing
any
of
that,
they
say,
moorman?s
entire
income
is
apportioned,
but
the
apportionment
of
the
entire
income
is
irrelevant.
what
counts
is
the
income
on
the
segment
of
the
business
that
consists
of
manufacture
in
illinois
and
selling
to
customers
in
iowa.
the
sales
fraction
of
course
does
not
do
any
apportioning.
it
merely
identifies
the
income
from
that
segment
of
the
business.
taken
by
itself,
it
taxes
100%
of
that
income.
the
sales
factor
is
economically
illegitimate
in
any
case,
but
is
tolerable
if
combined
with
property
and
payroll
factors
which
do
measure
the
income
producing
activity
and
which
also
measure
the
burden
on
governmental
services.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
yes,
because
as
we
have
attempted
to
point
out,
the
constitutionality
of
things
in
this
area
have
to
take
into
consideration
the
economic
realities
among
other
considerations.
constitutional
requirements
rest
to
considerable
degree
on
economics.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
that
is
the
interstate
commerce
argument.
there
is
also
a
due
process
point
because
they
are
reaching
outside
their
geographical
borders
to
grab
something
from
another
state.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
that
was
the
hypothetical
that
i
went
through
a
minute
ago,
maybe
illinois
uses
the
three-factor
formula
which
is
universal
except
for
iowa.
if
we
manufacture
in
illinois,
illinois
will
attribute
to
itself
2/3
of
the
income
derived
from
that
part
of
the
business
because
it
will
apply
a
property
factor
and
a
payroll
factor.
iowa
then,
as
to
shipments
into
iowa
attributes
100%
of
the
income
to
itself
because
it
attributes
all
of
it
to
location
of
the
customer.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
yes,
intuitionally
impermissible.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
there
are
many
cases
that
touch
on
this
particular
subject,
most
of
them
not
in
this
precise
context.
of
course
the
best
description
of
a
situation
is
general
motors
v.
district
of
columbia.
the
only
trouble
of
that
is
that
the
court
was
able
to
decide
around
the
statutory
ground
which
cannot
be
done
in
this
case.
freeman
v.
hewitt
is
a
case
in
which
a
different
type
of
tax
was
struck
down
because
of
the
mere
danger
of
a
double
taxation
by
a
second
state.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
yes,
i
do
not
know
of
any
decision
that
attacks
the
conclusion
in
that
one.
that
was
out
shipments.
now,
the
recent
decisions
that
have
upheld
attacks
of
somewhat
that
same
type
have
been
on
in
shipments.
freeman
v.
hewitt
is
not
the
only
case
of
course.
adams
v.
storen
is
another
one.
gwin,
white
and
prince
v,
henneford
is
still
another
and
there
are
a
great
many.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
no,
what
you
would
get
in
that
case,
100%
duplication,
200%,
still
the
166
that
we
have
here.
the
rule
has
long
been
that
what
one
state
does,
does
not
make
much
difference
to
what
another
state
does.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
but
the
conclusion
usually
is
they
are
both
good,
but
you
pose
an
extreme
case
and
there
is
something
in
that
case
to
uphold
the
neighboring
states
two
factor
formula.
in
west
virginia,
they
neighbor
on
iowa
and
if
they
ship
things
up
there,
the
fiscal
soundness,
economic
soundness
of
the
property
and
payroll
factors
would
throw
a
terrific
burden
on
the
state
of
iowa
to
justify
its
own
sales
factor
and
it
cannot
meet
that
burden.
furthermore
the
two
factors
while
differing
from
the
three
factors
used
by
the
majority
of
states
is
very
close
to
what
is
done
by
the
majority
of
states.
it
attributes
income
to
the
sources
of
capital
and
labor
which
of
course
this
court
has
often
said
are
the
sources
of
income.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
the
difference
is
that
i
do
not
think
both
statutes
would
be
unconstitutional
in
your
case.
i
think
that
the
sales
that
state
tax
would
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
it
does
and
it
puts
a
burden
on
both
states
to
prove
the
validity
of
its
method
of
doing
it
and
i
think
that
the
state
that
uses
property
and
payroll
can
easily
prove
it
and
the
state
that
uses
sales
cannot
come
anywhere
near
proving
it.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
that
is
right.
that
would
eliminate
the
double
taxation.
i
think
mr.
justice
rehnquist
asked
me
a
question
similar
to
that,
but
what
it
would
do
would
be
the
result
in
the
taxes
being
paid
to
the
wrong
states
because
there
is
not
any
basis
for
attributing
taxes
on
income
to
the
locus
of
the
customers
which
is
what
that
would
do.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
on
the
interstate
commerce
phase
of
the
case,
the
overlap.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
that
is
right.
we
have
said
enough
about
the
sales
fraction
not
apportioning.
a
tax
is
justified
only
by
governmental
services.
in
the
case
of
corporation,
services
to
corporations,
the
sales
factor
is
unrelated
to
services.
it
does
not
in
any
way
measure
the
burden
which
the
corporation
imposes
upon
the
state.
the
income
as
this
court
has
often
said
is
a
product
of
capital
or
labor
or
both
and
the
sales
factor
is
unrelated
to
that.
selling
effort
or
course
produces
income,
but
that
is
measured
by
capital
and
labor.
the
iowa
formula
has
no
relation
to
selling
effort.
it
has
not
relation
to
the
warehouses
and
inventories
nor
to
the
salesmen
employees
that
are
in
the
state
of
iowa.
the
tax
would
be
the
same
if
there
were
no
property
or
payroll
in
iowa.
it
would
also
be
the
same
if
moorman
were
to
pick
up
its
entire
illinois
factory
and
put
it
in
iowa.
it
would
not
increase
the
tax
in
the
slightest.
the
effect
of
the
formula
then
is
to
tax
capital
and
labor
which
is
in
illinois
and
again
impose
a
tariff
on
imports
and
subsidize
the
exports
and
in
conjunction
with
illinois
to
cause
a
double
tax.
in
the
powerful
brief
of
15
distinguished
economists,
the
economic
fallacy
in
the
sales
factor
is
pointed
out
to
tariff
on
imports
and
inducement
to
trade
war
with
resulting
injury
to
common
market.
now,
since
our
last
brief
was
written,
our
attention
has
been
drawn
to
an
activity
in
the
state
of
minnesota
which
shows
that
the
trade
war
which
was
theoretically
envisioned
by
the
economist
is
actually
going
on.
minnesota
had
permitted
manufacturers
such
as
moorman
shipping
into
minnesota
to
use
the
standard
three
factor
formula
equally
weighted,
property,
payroll
and
sales.
now,
they
have
a
bill
pending
which
would
force
moorman
and
other
similarly
situated
to
use
a
three
factor
formula,
but
only
15%
property,
15%
payroll
and
70%
sales.
the
report
that
i
get
is
that
this
is
done
in
retaliation
for
wisconsin?s
recent
changing
the
weights
in
its
formula
and
increasing
the
weight
on
sales
from
1/3
up
to
½.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
i
think
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
of
other
courts
have
upheld
minor
overlap,
particularly
where
the
overlap
is
not
directly
intentional.
it
just
happens
to
result
from
the
different
way
of
doing
things.
that
can
happen
under
the
three
factor
formula
equally
weighted
because
of
different
definitions
of
some
parts
of
the
formula,
but
it
does
not
produce
any
very
serious
overlap.
in
this
case,
we
have
a
serious
overlap,
it
is
141%,
and
there
is
nothing
just
incidental
about
it,
it
is
intentional,
a
deliberate
intention
to
impose
a
tariff
on
imports
and
subsidize
exports.
referring
to
that
minnesota
thing
again,
a
very
peculiar
provision
in
that
statute
or
its
pending
bill
as
it
has
been
reported
to
us,
although
we
have
not
seen
it,
is
that
it
contains
a
provision
that
will
not
take
effect
if
moorman
succeeds
in
this
case.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
the
effect
on
competition
is
nothing
in
which
we
can
measure.
we
at
this
point,
what
we
can
do
is
look
at
the
--
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
even
if
illinois
were
not
taxing
the
same
income,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
first
two
years
in
this
appeal,
they
did
not,
their
corporate
income
tax
came
in
later,
it
still
is
a
tax
on
imports
because
it
is
attributing
to
iowa
a
100%
--
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
that
results
if
there
is
another
tax
as
there
is
in
this
case
because
moorman
has
to
pay
tax
on
166%
of
its
income
and
iowa
--
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
that
is
right
and
an
iowa
manufacturer
would
not
pay
that.
the
biggest
boom
is
to
the
iowa
manufacturer
who
sells
into
illinois
or
some
other
place
because
he
does
not
pay
any
tax
to
iowa
at
all
and
taxed
only
1/3
of
his
income
when
it
gets
into
illinois
because
the
application
of
the
sale
factor
in
that
case.
now,
many
states
do
it
one
way
and
iowa
does
it
another?
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
yes,
there
is.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
no.
it
is
not
independent
of
the
overlap
--
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
yes,
the
overlap
is
what
illustrates
on
this
is
the
consequence
of
the
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce.
i
said
when
iowa
does
it
one
way
and
all
the
other
states
do
it
some
other
way,
iowa
has
to
give
way,
unless
iowa
can
clearly
establish
that
it
is
right
and
the
others
are
clearly
wrong.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
that
is
true
and
iowa,
since
it
is
so
different
from
everybody
else,
has
the
burden
of
proof
of
showing
that
it
is
right.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
so?
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
i
merely
cite
the
decisions
of
this
court.
the
most
recent
one,
very
recently,
the
raymond
transport
company
v.
wisconsin
in
which
a
wisconsin
statute
was
held
unconstitutional
or
regulation
because
it
was
different
from
the
regulations
of
other
states,
thereby
imposing
a
burden
on,
in
that
case
a
trucking
industry,
and
before
that,
there
have
been
others
like
bibb
v,
navajo
trucking
is
another
one
of
the
same
type
of
thing.
a
perfectly
valid
statute
if
it
stood
by
itself,
but
invalid
only
because
it
was
incompatible
with
other
states
and
imposed
an
unreasonable
burden
on
the
interstate
commerce
involved
in
those
cases.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
no.
the
case
had
to
have
evidence
to
show
two
things.
one
was
what
other
states
were
doing
and
the
second
one
was
that
the
interplay
of
wisconsin
and
the
other
states
imposed
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce
and
that
evidence
was
in
the
case.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
in
early
years,
it
was
8%
and
in
the
latter
years,
10%,
pretty
stiff
rate
for
a
state
income
tax.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
no,
you
could
do
that.
the
appellee
has
not
made
any
case
of
their
own.
they
have
argued
that
100%
of
the
income
is
not
taxed,
that
is
wrong.
the
statute
defines
the
income
and
in
their
brief,
they
say
that
the
state
taxed
a
100%
of
the
income
of
local
businesses
which
it
did,
but
it
also
taxed
a
100%
of
the
income
--
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
you
asked
me
about
that
one
once
before
and
the
answer
here
is
that
in
this
particular
case,
the
total
tax
if
they
were
to
tax
on
gross
receipts
which
would
be
a
low
rate
of
tax
would
be
substantially
less
than
the
tax
that
is
involved
in
this
case.
we
applied
the
washington
statute
to
these
facts
and
came
out
way
down.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
there
is
not
any
measure.
the
sales
formula
does
not
measure
anything
that
the
state
does
for
moorman,
nor
any
place
of
moorman
earns
the
income.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
if
the
tax
was
very
low,
we
would
not
be
quarreling
about
it,
but
the
legal
principle,
constitutional
principles
would
be
just
the
same,
assuming
they
are
applying
-
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
it
would
have
an
interstate
commerce
objection
if
they
taxed
their
own
corporations
on
the
same
basis
and
then
exempt
them
from
the
tax
as
they
sales
factor
does,
but
applied
it
to
moorman.
now,
of
course,
if
the
amount
is
very
small,
nobody
is
going
to
complain.
that
is
why
gross
receipts
taxes
were
allowed
to
exist
for
so
long.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
yes,
but
the
--
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
no,
but
moorman
is
paying
the
same
taxes
to
illinois
so
that
it
was
not
any
--
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
yes,
sir,
the
rate
and
the
base
are
unaffected
in
an
argument
of
apportionment
which
is
all
we
are
arguing
about
here.
the
present
situation
then
is
that
we
have
a
double
tax
which
is
a
violation
of
commerce
clause.
we
have
a
tax
on
manufacturing
that
is
out
of
the
state
which
violates
due
process.
it
also
violates
fundamental
principle
of
federalism
which
confines
states
to
their
own
geographical
jurisdiction
and
it
favors
local
industry
which
is
a
violation
of
equal
protection.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
that
one
minute
is
quite
sufficient.
the
arguments
that
have
been
made
are
all
adequately
answered
in
our
briefs
and
reply
brief,
but
i
want
to
emphasize
to
the
court
one
thing,
that
the
directive
here
is
challenging
the
assumption
which
is
inherent
in
the
statute.
we
did
not
make
any
assumption,
the
statute
makes
it.
that
assumption
is
that
the
income
derived
with
respect
to
any
dollar
of
sales
is
the
same
as
income
derived
from
any
other
dollar
of
sales
and
that
is
the
basis
for
the
attribution
of
income
to
the
income
producing
activities
in
illinois.
they
keep
arguing
for
separate
accounting
because
this
court
has
held
that
separate
accounting
is
impermissible
in
the
case
of
a
unitary
business.
hans
rees
was
not
a
unitary
business.
