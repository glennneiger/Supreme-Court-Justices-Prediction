washington
in
district
of
columbia.
justice
byron
r.
white
tell
me
specifically,
what
impact
does
this
sales
factor
have
with
respect
to
the
competition
between
iowans
and
the
people
from
illinois?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
it
is
a
tax
on
imports
because
both
illinois
and
iowa
are
taxing
the
same
income
and
so
that
tax
burden
on
moorman
is
higher?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
it
help
iowans
control
the
iowa
market?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
makes
it
less
able
to
compete
in
the
iowa
market?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
do
you
think
there
is
a
discrimination
then
against
interstate
commerce
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
that
an
independent
basis
for
invalidating?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it
is
the
same?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
have
not
paid
that
component
of
the
illinois
tax
at
all
and
there
would
not
be
any
increase
in
iowa?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
that
was
a
third,
that
is
what
the
accountants
testified
to
and
on
any
reasonable
accounting
basis
a
third
of
the
income
is
assignable
to
the
illinois
manufacturing
and
then
iowa
said
well,
we
are
still
going
to
use
the
single
sales
formula.
what
would
you
say
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
are
you
suggesting
that
you
will
agree
that
constitutionally,
iowa
may
not
tax
income
that
could
be
shown
to
be
traceable
to
the
illinois
manufacturing?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
not
say
the
evidence
like
that
would
be
irrelevant
or
inadmissible,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
the
judges
concluded
or
made
findings
that
based
on
the
evidence
before
me,
1/3
of
the
income
is
due
to
manufacturing
in
illinois
and
if
there
is
a
finding
like
that,
would
you
argue
that
iowa
could
nevertheless
tax
that
part
of
the
income?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that,
but
if
you
