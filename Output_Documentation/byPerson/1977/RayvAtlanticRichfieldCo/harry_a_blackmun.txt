mr.
sherwood,
am
i
correct,
is
it
agreed
that
the
district
court
is
to
be
reversed
with
respect
to
the
presumption
ruling
concerning
registered
vessels
as
distinguished
from
enrolled
vessel?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
secondly,
and
this
is
perhaps
of
no
relevance,
do
any
or
all
of
our
coast
tankers
carry
foreign
flags?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
that
on
the
record?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
all
of
them?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
can
i
assume
they
possess
federal
licenses
from
the
us?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
is
all
i
have.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
of
course,
on
those
figures
there
is
a
limit.
in
the
strong
wind
in
rosario
strait,
a
canoe
is
smaller
than
a
120,000
deadweight
ton
vessel
and
yet
it
would
be
a
lot
less
maneuverable?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
is
not
a
straight
line
of
comparison
right
down?
