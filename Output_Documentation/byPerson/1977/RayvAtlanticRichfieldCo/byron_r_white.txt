justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
the
united
states
is
just
wrong
with
respect
to
licensed
united
states-flag
ships?
justice
byron
r.
white
has
the
coastguard
put
some
size
limitations
for
some
areas
in
the
puget
sound?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
the
--
are
there
some
local
rules
then
about
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
sherwood,
would
you
still
say
that
there
was
preemption
or
that
there
was
a
conflict
if
the
coastguard
did
not
announced
this
traffic
control
plan
in
puget
sound?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
the
existence
of
the
power
to
control
the
size
was
enough?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
what
case
would
that
be
enough?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
you
just
have
to
spell
out
some
intention
from
the
comprehensiveness
of
the
federal
law
that
they
did
not
intend
state
interference?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
have
a
tougher
case
without
the
local
traffic
plan?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it
would
have
been
four
times
as
big,
it
would
have
been
in
the
worst
disaster?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
sherwood,
what
federal
interest
could
not
be
protected
here
by
the
coastguard
if
it
wanted
to
protect
it
or
by
the
secretary
if
they
really
wanted
to
preclude
the
state
regulation?
it
would
be
easy
to
preclude
any
of
these
state
regulations,
would
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
if
there
is
any
argument
about
it,
the
coastguard
can
make
it
unmistakably
clear,
could
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
still
not
addressing
yourself
to
my
question.
my
question
is
if
it
wanted
to,
it
could
make
it
specific?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it
said
“the
following
requirements
will
be
observed
and
no
others,”
it
may
be
imposed,
i
suppose
they
could
say
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
a
reason
if
the
federal
authorities
think
that
a
state
should
be
disentitled
to
impose
any
stricter
requirements
than
the
federal
rule
and
there
are
many
areas
where
states
are
permitted
to
impose
stricter
requirements.
why
should
washington
not
impose
stricter
requirements
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
do
not
know
that
we
were
bound
by
the
chief
counsel
of
the
coastguard?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
if
it
were
decided
that
the
law
in
its
present
form,
including
the
coastguard
regulations,
do
not
preempt
or
do
not
foreclose
or
preclude
this
system
of
regulation
by
the
state
of
washington
that
the
coastguard,
if
it
wanted
to,
could
do
something
about
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
this
court
suggested
that
whatever
it
has
done
is
not
enough,
i
suppose
the
coastguard
would
then
know
that
it
is
not
enough
and
would
you
say
that
the
coastguard
had
the
power
under
any
of
these
statutes
that
are
involved
to
foreclose
state
regulation,
state
redesign-requirements
for
example?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
i
thought
you
were
urging
also
that
the
federal
statute
contemplated
perhaps
non-uniform
regulation
in
many
respects.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
you
just
said
it
contemplated
uniform
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
you
indicated
that
the
coastguard
might
put
on
different
requirements
at
different
ports?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
the
fact
that
a
company
might
have
to
satisfy
some
requirement
in
puget
sound
and
something
different
in
san
diego
or
in
new
york
is
nothing
so
horrendous,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
case
concerns
the
ports
and
waterways
safety
act
which
was
passed
by
congress
in
1972
and
which
regulates
navigation
on
various
inland
waters
of
states
including
the
waters
of
puget
sound
in
the
state
of
washington.
it
also
controls
the
design
and
operating
characteristics
of
oil
tankers.
in
1975,
the
state
of
washington
adopted
a
statute
which
also
regulates,
in
substantial
respects,
the
operating
characteristics
of
tankers.
for
one
thing,
it
requires
that
any
tanker
of
50,000
tonnes
or
more
take
on
a
state
licensed
pilot,
for
another
it
requires
tankers
of
over
40,000
tonnes
to
have
certain
design
characteristics
or
are
to
be
accompanied
by
tugs,
and
lastly
it
forbids
tankers
of
over
125,000
tonnes
from
entering
puget
sound
under
any
conditions.
tanker
owners
and
operators
soon
challenged
the
law
on
constitutional
grounds.
their
principal
argument
was
that
the
ports
and
waterways
safety
act
occupied
this
field
and
that
the
washington
statute
was
in
conflict
either
with
specific
--
either
specifically
or
in
general
with
the
scheme
of
the
federal
law.
a
three-judge
court
agreed
with
the
plaintiffs
and
held
that
the
washington
statute
was
unconstitutional
in
its
entirety.
we
noted
probable
jurisdiction
and
we
now
reverse
in
part
and
affirm
in
part.
in
brief,
we
hold
as
follows.
first,
the
requirement
that
the
tankers
take
on
a
state
licensed
pilot
is
valid
as
to
ships
in
the
foreign
trade
but
invalid
with
respect
to
coast
wise
vessels.
second,
the
state's
design
requirements
cannot
be
enforced
in
face
of
the
federal
act.
third,
tankers
may
nevertheless
be
required
to
be
accompanied
by
tugs.
fourth,
the
exclusion
of
large
tankers
from
the
sound
is
inconsistent
with
the
federal
scheme
and
cannot
be
enforced.
i
have
filed
an
opinion
with
the
clerk,
an
opinion
for
the
court.
the
opinion
is
joined
in
its
entirety
by
the
chief
justice
