we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
76-930,
governor
ray
against
atlantic
richfield.
mr.
attorney
general,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
attorney
general.
mr.
sherwood?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
at
the
present
time,
i
suppose
the
regulations
for
vessels
docking
at
alexandria
are
quite
different
from
those
at
new
york,
or
new
orleans,
or
mobile?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
federal
regulation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
understood
the
attorney
general
gorton’s
argument
to
be
simply
that
from
the
state’s
point
of
view
a
disaster
or
a
spill
from
150,000
ton
tanker
is
a
much
greater
disaster
than
a
50,000
and
you
do
not
need
any
evidence
for
that,
do
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
until
the
coastguard
put
in
new
regulations
and
limitations
about
bulkheads
the
contrary
was
true,
was
it
not,
that
the
larger
tankers
spilled
a
great
deal
more
oil
than
the
smaller
ones?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
addressing
that
to
the
present
state
of
affairs
or
the
earliest
spills
four
or
five
years
ago?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
well,
thought
that
was
about
all
the
attorney
general
was
arguing
that
the
larger
tankers
were
potentially
greater
risks
in
these
narrow
straights
and
shallow
waters?
i
did
not
think
he
was
representing
that
there
was
any
specific
evidence
on
that
but
he
was
arguing
from
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
i
take
it,
you
would
concede
that
smaller
tankers
will
expose
the
state’s
waters
or
these
waters
in
puget
sound
to
less
hazard
than
a
150,000-ton
tankers?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
do
not
have
50
different
states
with
ports,
do
you?
how
many
are
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
your
point
that
if
let
us
assume
that
there
are
20
different
ports
that
take
tankers
of
50,000
or
over,
that
at
least
there
is
one
coordinating
central
authority
that
is
recognizing
the
reasons
for
a
different
set
of
standards
in
mobile
bay
and
puget
sound,
at
least
the
right
hand
knows
what
the
left
hand
is
doing
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
sherwood,
in
many
areas,
the
affected
states
dealing
with
a
problem
like
this
get
together
with
the
federal
government
and
work
things
out.
does
this
record
show
or
is
it
a
matter
of
public
notice
that
there
has
or
has
not
been
such
coordination
between
federal
and
states
authorities?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
was
speaking
more
generally,
the
states
generally
with
the
federal
government
rather
than
just
washington?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired.
we
will
resume
at
1:00
with
the
attorney
general.[recess]
mr.
sherwood,
justice
blackmun
has
a
question
for
you
before
we
proceed
with
the
attorney
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
sherwood.
mr.
attorney
general?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
your
emphasis
there
also
on
the
maneuverability
of
such
a
large
craft?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
those
tankers
ever
go
16
knots
in
that
area?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
we
to
take
that
as
meaning
that
the
coastguard
can
step
in
today
and
take
care
of
all
mr.
sherwood’s
problems?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
76-930,
ray,
the
governor
of
washington
state
against
atlantic
richfield
co.
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
white.
chief
justice
warren
e.

thank
you,
mr.
justice
