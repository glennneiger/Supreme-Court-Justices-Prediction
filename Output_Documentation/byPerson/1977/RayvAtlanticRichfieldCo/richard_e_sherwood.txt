mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
florida
lime
&
avocado
growers
against
paul,
mr.
justice
brennan
stated
for
the
court
that
the
maturity
of
avocados
seems
to
be
inherently
unlikely
candidate
for
exclusive
federal
regulation.
by
contrast,
we
would
submit
that
the
subject
matter
in
this
case,
regulation
of
the
construction,
design,
and
navigation
of
seagoing
tankers,
the
lifeline
of
this
country’s
energy-fueled
economy,
bringing
oil
as
they
do
from
abroad
and
now
from
alaska
is
an
obvious
candidate
for
exclusive
regulation
by
the
federal
government
and
one
which,
under
the
ports
and
waterways
safety
act
of
1972
as
well
as
other
legislation
has
been
preempted
to
the
exclusion
of
state
regulation
such
as
the
washington
tanker
law.
in
striking
the
delicate
balance
between
energy
needs
and
environmental
protection,
a
balance
which
involved
the
foreign
relations
of
the
united
states,
50%
of
our
oil
comes
from
abroad,
95%
of
tankers
are
of
foreign
registry,
a
balance
also
which
involves
the
competing
interests
of
the
coastal
and
the
inland
states,
only
the
federal
government
has
the
sensitivity
and
the
tools.
if
mr.
gorton
is
right
and
the
tanker
law
is
just
a
simple
exercise
of
the
police
power,
and
i
would
note
in
that
connection
the
view
in
southern
pacific
and
arizona
that
one
cannot
always
hide
behind
the
convenient
apologetics
of
the
police
power,
then
other
states
can
adapt
different
size
limits,
different
design
requirements,
different
tug
boat
penalties.
alaska
has
already
done
so
encouraging
large
tankers,
mandating
different
design
characteristics,
and
15
states'
amicus
curiae
are
waiting
eagerly
in
the
wings.
in
this
context,
i
turn
to
the
specific
features
of
the
washington
tanker
law,
each
of
which
is
preempted
by
federal
law
and
by
coastguard
action
pursuant
to
federal
law.
first,
the
size
limitation.
we
believe
that
it
is
clear
from
the
ports
and
waterways
safety
act
that
a
size
limit
is
bad
both
as
a
traffic
regulation
under
title
i
of
the
ports
and
waterways
safety
act
and
as
a
design
requirement
under
title
ii.
1013
of
title
i
gives
the
coastguard
the
power
to
set
size
and
speed
limits.
in
the
senate
report,
leading
up
to
the
act,
at
pages
32
and
33,
there
is
a
specific
statement
rejecting
the
idea
of
general-size
limitation
on
tankers
and
a
statement
of
preference
for
specificity
for
flexible
regulation
by
the
coastguard.
the
coastguard
has
established
a
vessel
traffic
system
for
puget
sound
and
despite
mr.
gorton’s
view,
i
would
suggest
that
pages
141
through
198
of
the
appendix
which
spell
out
that
vessel
traffic
system
indicate
its
comprehensiveness,
including
specific
reporting
requirements
in
rosario
strait.
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
as
to
the
size
limit,
i
would
certainly
think
so
because
the
coastguard
as
well
as
the
maritime
administration
--
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
yes,
i
would,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
well,
our
view
would
be
under
both
cases
such
as
lockheed
or
northern
states
--
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
yes.
that
where
you
have
a
statute
which
comprehensively
regulates
a
field
and
delegates
the
power
to
balance
factors,
the
assignment
of
the
right
to
set
a
size
limit,
we
believe,
must
be
related
to
an
exclusion
on
the
part
of
any
state
of
the
power
to
set
a
size
limit.
otherwise
--
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
we
would
have
a
different
case.
i
suspect
it
would
be
tougher,
but
the
local
traffic
plan
contemplates
also
that
there
would
be
limits
on
the
size
of
vessels
going
in
both
directions
in
rosario
strait
and
the
coastguard
retains
both
the
power
to
ban
vessels
from
puget
sound
or
from
any
other
waterway
of
the
united
states
when
there
is
a
determination
that
such
a
ban
is
appropriate.
so
in
our
view
the
size
limit
is
precluded
both
by
title
i,
giving
the
coastguard
to
set
size
limits,
and
by
title
ii,
giving
the
coastguard
the
power
to
set
design
requirements
because
the
coastguard
in
mandating
design
requirements
has
not
drawn
any
limit
on
the
size
of
a
vessel.
the
maritime
administration,
in
administering
the
subsidy
program,
has
not
drawn
any
size
limitation
on
the
size
of
vessels
which
will
be
functioning
in
the
commerce
of
the
united
states
and
there
has
been
no
effort
to
restrict
either
the
building
of
vessels
in
us
shipyards
or
the
building
of
vessels
in
other
countries
in
terms
of
their
ability
to
come
into
the
united
states.
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
indeed,
justice
rehnquist.
there
are
very
few
ports
where
a
tanker
larger
than
125,000
deadweight
tons
can
presently
go.
the
three
logical
port
areas
are
all
in
the
western
united
states
and
the
state
of
washington,
by
its
legislation,
would
cut
off
one
of
those.
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
no,
i
think
they
were
thinking
in
terms
of
two
possibilities.
one,
existing
ports
and
the
other
the
construction
of
new
ports
which
may
take
place
at
some
time
in
the
future,
including
deep
water
ports,
none
of
which
is
has
yet
been
built.
but
certainly,
the
commitment
of
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
in
money
without
the
establishment
of
a
size
limitation
is
evidence
that
if
there
is
to
be
a
size
limitation,
it
ought
to
be
federally
imposed.
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
yes,
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
state
is
powerless
to
keep
it
out
and
the
state
--
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
well,
i
think
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
bottoms
of
any
of
these
vessels
will
or
have
been
ripped
out.
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
well,
in
that
circumstance,
the
coastguard
has
an
affirmative
obligation
to
prevent
the
vessel
from
entering
puget
sound
or
any
other
port.
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
it
would
be
my
position
that
it
would
be
the
obligation
then
of
the
state.
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
no,
i
would
think
again,
that
would
be
beyond
the
power
of
the
state
because
of
the
scheme
of
regulation
--
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
no,
i
do
not
think
the
state
needs
to
let
any
vessel
come
in
its
waters
because
the
state
has
the
right
both
to
go
to
the
federal
authorities
as
well
as
to
seek
the
kind
of
political
address
which
was
sought
in
the
case
of
the
marine
mammal
protection
act
at
the
federal
level.
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
that
would
be
our
position,
yes.
we
believe
that
the
area
of
regulation
is
one
which
requires
that
if
there
would
be
size
limits
to
be
set,
then
the
coastguard
in
consultation,
as
it
is
mandated
to
consult
with
the
states
and
with
the
local
authorities
is
the
only
proper
organ
to
make
those
determinations
because
otherwise
you
would
have
each
state
setting
foreign
policy,
each
state
making
determinations
and
parenthetically
there
is
nothing
whatever
in
the
record
which
would
support
the
conclusion
of
mr.
gorton
that
there
is
a
safety
differential
in
a
vessel
larger
than
125,000
deadweight
tons.
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
no,
the
state
had
no
role
in
rosario.
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
no.
indeed,
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
there
was
no
preexisting
vessel
traffic
system
imposed
by
the
state
of
washington.
the
first
such
system
came
into
effect
when
the
coastguard
acting
under
the
ports
and
waterways
safety
act
adapted
that
system
and
the
washington
state
legislation
was
two
or
three
years
later.
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
well,
they
clearly
could,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
well,
it
is
my
understanding
that
rules
could
be
laid
down
which
would
be
flexible
depending
on
particular
ports
and
indeed
the
section
from
the
senate
legislative
report
that
i
read
to
you,
contemplates
that
there
would
be
no
across
the
board
size
limitation
that
would
be
imposed
specific
area,
by
specific
area
or
depending
upon
other
conditions,
weather,
for
example,
such
as
the
limitations
now
in
rosario.
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
yes,
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
federal
system
contemplates
that
there
would
be
diversity
of
regulation,
but
that
it
would
be
diversity
of
federal
regulation.
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
i
am
certain
that
they
are.
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
yes.
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
well,
i
would
suggest
that
you
would
need
some
evidence
because
it
is
a
question
of
whether
the
entire
vessel
is
destroyed.
the
bulk
of
spills
that
have
taken
place
have
involved
far
less
than
the
entirety
of
the
vessel’s
oil.
indeed,
one
has
a
pattern
of
dockside
spills
or
very
small
spills,
which
is
the
norm
and
the
bulk
of
the
vessels,
i
would
suggest,
are
of
varying
sizes,
but
there
are
relatively
few
catastrophes
in
which
the
entire
vessel
is
destroyed.
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
i
do
not
believe
so,
chief
justice
burger.
it
is
my
impression
that
one
must
go
well-outside
the
record
on
this,
but
the
office
of
technology
assessment
of
the
federal
government
has
issued
a
report
on
the
subject.
it
is
my
impression
that
there
is
no
evidence
that
large
tankers
create
a
danger
of
greater
spills
than
does
a
proliferation
of
smaller
vessels,
particularly
in
a
confined
waterway.
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
i
believe
both.
the
torrey
canyon,
for
example,
is
a
human
error
in
broad
daylight
and
is
not
something
i
think
that
would
have
been
prevented
by
any
form
of
design
requirement
which
could
have
been
imposed
upon
the
vessel.
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
i
think
that
is
right,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
all
that
we
have
in
the
record
on
this
is
a
stipulation
between
the
parties
that
there
is
a
good
faith
dispute
as
to
whether
more
smaller
tankers
creates
a
greater
danger
than
fewer
larger
tankers.
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
no,
i
would
not
because
in
order
to
bring
the
same
amount
of
petroleum
in,
you
are
going
to
require
a
larger
number
of
smaller
vessels.
so,
if
you
had
seven
20,000-ton
vessels
that
will
be
the
equivalent
of
one
140,000-ton
vessel.
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
it
is
less
maneuverable
under
certain
circumstances.
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
no,
i
think
that
is
a
function
of
the
equipment.
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
no,
i
would
not.
my
view
on
that
would
be
that
while
it
might
require
a
longer
time
to
stop
because
of
the
size
of
the
vessel,
but
it
would
depend
on
the
characteristics
of
the
particular
vessel
as
to
whether
you
had
danger
of
lack
of
maneuverability.
indeed,
the
coastguard,
in
imposing
vessel
equipment
requirements,
has
not
attempted
to
differentiate
between
vessels
larger
than
125,000
deadweight
tons,
the
basic
rules
that
have
been
adapted
under
title
ii
of
the
ports
and
waterways
safety
act
have
dealt
with
vessels
larger
than
20,000
deadweight
tons
or
larger
than,
in
some
instances,
1,500
deadweight
tons.
moreover,
neither
rosario
straits
nor
puget
sound
is
a
tiny
or
shallow
place.
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
i
am
not
familiar
with
griffin
on
collisions,
but
my
view
on
that,
mr.
justice
marshall,
is
that
it
is
a
function
of
the
aging
equipment
of
the
vessel.
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
well,
if
they
had
identical
characteristics,
i
would
suppose
that
a
smaller
vessel
would
be
somewhat
more
maneuverable,
but
in
an
area
that
is
as
broad
as
rosario
strait
more
than
a
nautical
mile
wide
and
as
deep
as
puget
sound
and
if
you
look
at
exhibit
b
to
the
appendix,
you
will
find
that
puget
sound
in
most
places
is
deep
enough
to
accommodate
any
vessel
afloat.
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
because
the
coastguard
has
concluded
that,
as
to
the
large
vessels,
it
is
the
safer
way
to
go.
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
yes
and
it
is
our
position
that
the
coastguard
has
precluded
them.
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
i
just
do
not
think,
mr.
justice
white
that
the
coastguard
is
going
to
function
in
a
fashion
in
which
it
is
making
determinations
that
it
is
barring
a
particular
law.
i
think,
rather,
that
the
way
in
which
it
has
acted
under
the
ports
and
waterways
safety
act
has
been
to
adapt
affirmative
requirements.
for
example,
there
are
four
design
features
in
the
washington
tanker
law
which
mr.
gorton
did
not
advert
to
requiring
that
there
would
be
double
bottoms,
twin
screws,
extra
propulsive
mechanisms,
and
twin
radars.
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
in
theory,
the
coastguard
could
say
“we
prohibit
you
in
doing
this,”
but
in
practice,
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
coastguard
--
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
yes,
it
could
say
that,
but
under
the
statute
there
is
no
reason
why
they
should
say
it
when
you
have
got
on
the
one
side
the
102
(b)
language
which
says
that
states
are
limited.
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
well,
the
coastguard
has
taken
the
position
as
its
chief
counsel
indicated
at
the
time
that
the
law
was
passed,
that
it
was
preempted
by
the
ports
and
waterways
safety
act,
and
therefore
--
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
i
am
confident
that
you
are
not
because
you
are
interpreting
a
statute
of
general
application
with
a
legislative
history.
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
yes,
but
the
question
is
what
must
the
coastguard
do.
take,
for
example,
tug
boats.
the
coastguard
has
issued
a
notice
of
intended
rule
making
for
the
general
requirement
of
minimum
standards
for
tug
boats.
it
has
given
the
captain
of
the
port
the
responsibility
to
require
tug
boats
whenever
it
wishes
under
both
titles
i
and
title
ii.
it
has
actually
imposed
a
requirement
in
the
margins
not
left
open
for
it
by
the
washington
authorities.
in
alaska,
it
has
imposed
a
narrower
requirement
than
the
state
requirement
in
alaska
waters
and
that
is
presently
being
contested
on
the
same
basis
that
if
the
federal
authorities
do
not
exercise
the
full
scope
of
their
power
under
the
ports
and
waterways
safety
act,
it
creates
an
intolerable
situation
for
both
vessel
design
and
vessel
movement
if
each
state
is
in
a
position
to
adapt
its
own
regulations
on
the
point.
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
well,
i
would
suggest
justice
rehnquist,
that
you
would
otherwise
create
a
situation
in
which
each
time
the
coastguard
considers
and
rejects
something,
twin
screws
for
example,
that
a
state
would
then
be
in
a
position
where
it
could
add
on
the
requirement
so
long
as
it
was
something
that
the
coastguard
had
not
said
was
prohibited
for
states
to
do.
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
well,
the
coastguard
has
here
considered
and
rejected
each
of
the
design
features
of
the
washington
law.
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
it
can
at
this
time
in
washington
with
the
imposition
of
a
penalty
in
the
magnitude
of
some
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
per
year.
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
well,
there
is
good
faith
dispute
as
to
the
efficacy
of
tug
boats
in
doing
anything
because
they
are
not
attached
to
the
vessel.
they
trail
along
behind
it.
they
are
different
from
the
federal
requirement
and
thus
our
view
is
that
that
is
a
penalty
as
the
solicitor
general
very
candidly
stated
in
discussing
the
subject.
if
washington
can
do
it
here,
each
other
coastal
jurisdiction
can
impose
its
own
variant.
it
can
impose
its
own
design
requirements.
it
can
impose
its
own
alternatives
as
to
how
you
get
around
the
design
requirements
and
you
have
again
a
situation
in
which
the
purpose
of
the
federal
statute
and
the
tank
vessel
act
before
the
ports
and
waterways
safety
act,
to
promote
uniform
and
comprehensive
regulation
is
completely
undermined.
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
well,
the
coastguard,
we
submit,
has
acted
in
the
only
legible
way
that
it
can
in
dealing
with
the
alternative
regulations.
it
has
made
known
its
position
of
protest
both
in
washington
and
in
alaska.
it
has
gone
about
the
regulation
of
size
and
the
design
and
the
movement
of
the
vessels
and
has
done
so
in
a
fashion
which
is
inconsistent
with
competing
state
regulation
even
if
the
states
are
seeking
to
help
out.
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
i
would
believe
that
it
clearly
would
and
it
is
our
position
that
it
in
fact
has
exercised
it.
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
yes,
i
believe
it
does.
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
when
i
say
uniform,
i
mean
uniform
by
one
body
being
the
umpire
that
is
the
point
of
the
federal
system
is
that
there
are
political
disputes
--
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
as
indeed,
it
has.
it
has
different
vessel
traffic
systems
in
the
various
ports
which
it
regulates.
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
it
is
a
question
of
how
many
political
entities
a
company
must
deal
with
and
the
company
would
then
be
placed
at
the
tender
mercies
of
50
different
state
legislatures
rather
than
--
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
well,
actually
there
are
a
number
of
inland
states
that
have
taken
a
position
in
both
directions
in
this
case,
including
those
that
are
on
the
great
lakes
and
those
that
are
on
the
rivers
as
to
their
right
to
regulate
and
obviously
it
would
not
be
50
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
precisely.
our
view
also
would
be
that
the
coastguard
can
preempt
under
the
ports
and
waterways
safety
act
only
if
the
ports
and
waterways
safety
act
itself
is
regarded
as
preemptive,
that
is
it
is
very
difficult
as
a
logical
proposition
to
understand
how
if
the
statute
does
not
do
any
preempting,
it
can
be
read
as
giving
an
abstract
power
of
preemption
and
at
the
same
time
of
course,
the
coastguard
has
done
in
what
we
would
submit
as
the
only
logical
way,
the
non-imposition
of
size
limits
except
selectively,
the
non-imposition
of
design
requirements
as
contemplated
by
washington,
with
the
imposition
of
plenty
of
other
design
requirements
and
the
development
of
tug
escort
systems
in
areas
where
things
appropriate
and
under
specific
circumstances.
i
would
also
note
that
there
is
of
course
a
commerce
issue
which
is
an
equally
significant
one
because
under
kelly,
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
this
is
on
seaworthiness
in
the
commonly
accepted
sense
and
that
there
is
a
burden
under
such
cases
as
southern
pacific
and
arizona,
beard,
and
may
pier
that
there
is
an
impact
on
foreign
policy
because
you
have,
as
set
forth
at
considerable
length
in
our
brief,
the
problem
of
negotiating
with
other
countries
about
what
the
size
limits
are
going
to
be,
what
the
design
requirements
are
going
to
be.
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
yes
and
the
only
historic
exception,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
and
the
only
one
that
i
am
able
to
find
aside
from
the
limited
regulation
of
docksides
is
that
pilotage
since
1789
has
been
regarded
as
something
where
you
can
have
a
local
pilot
for
vessels
that
are
coming
from
abroad.
but
i
would
submit
that
that
is
the
full
teaching
of
cooley
and
that
the
other
cases
in
the
field
indicate,
as
does
the
new
statutory
scheme,
that
there
should
be
exclusive
federal
regulation.
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
well,
it
is
our
understanding,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
that
if
the
court
affirms
the
striking
down
of
the
entire
pilotage
provision
that
there
was
a
preexisting
provision
of
washington
law
which
did
require
state
pilots
on
all
vessels
which
were
registered
and,
thus,
if
the
court
struck
down
that
provision
in
its
entirety
from
the
tanker
law,
there
would
be
in
place
a
washington
requirement
of
pilots
on
the
vessels
that
come
from
abroad.
therefore,
i
think
it
becomes
a
matter
essentially
irrelevant
as
to
which
way
the
court
goes
on
that
point,
as
if
it
struck
down
the
entire
pilotage
provision,
there
is
the
preexisting
washington
law,
if
it
struck
down
only
that
portion
pertaining
to
enrolled
vessels,
that
also
would
be
an
appropriate
disposition.
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
yes.
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
yes.
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
no,
the
majority
of
the
vessels
owned
by
the
company
from
the
record
are
us-flag,
but
the
bulk
of
the
vessels
that
have
brought
foreign
crude
into
puget
sound
for
atlantic
richfield
were
foreign-flag,
that
is,
the
15
vessels
that
were
larger
than
125,000
deadweight
tons
were
all
vessels
not
owned
by
atlantic
richfield,
but
rather
were
chartered
by
it
and
were
foreign-flag
vessels.
i
think
you
can
see
from
the
record,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
the
list
of
all
of
the
vessels
that
have
come
in
and
they
run
a
patchwork
of
foreign-flag
and
us-flag,
some
of
them
owned
by
the
company
and
some
not.
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
yes,
all
of
the
atlantic
richfield
vessels
have
the
relevant
federal
licenses
and
permits
under
the
tank
vessel
act
and
certification
under
other
federal
statutes
and
similarly
all
of
the
vessels
that
are
foreign-flag
have
the
appropriate
arrangements
for
reciprocal
treatment
under
our
laws.
mr.
richard
e.
sherwood
the
record
does
not
i
believe,
justice
stevens,
tell
us
anything
other
than
the
existence
of
a
good
faith
dispute.
although,
there
are
portions
of
the
record,
the
environment
impact
statement
for
example,
of
the
coastguard
in
adapting
its
design
requirements
which
allude
to
tug
escorts
as
a
possible
approach
toward
vessel
safety
in
some
limited
circumstances.
there
is
also
in
the
record
the
instances
where
the
coastguard
on
a
quite
pinpointed
basis,
good
deal
different
from
the
way
the
state
of
washington
has
done
it,
has
required
tug
escorts
both
in
puget
sound
for
lpg
tankers
and
also
in
alaska.
