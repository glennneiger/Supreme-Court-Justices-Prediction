mr.
sherwood,
may
i
ask
you
one
question
that
i
did
not
have
a
chance
to
ask
before
lunch?
does
the
record
tell
us
anything
about
the
safety
advantages,
if
any,
of
having
the
tug
escorts
that
you
describe
as
a
penalty
for
not
having
the
design
requirements
under
125,000
tons?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
