justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
a
legislative
definition
or
an
accepted
definition
of
the
line
between
the
strait
of
juan
de
fuca
and
puget
sound?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
why
did
congress
say
“structures
only”
in
that
language?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
meant
that
the
states
could
not
act
in
that
area?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
concede
that
the
pilotage
requirement
is
invalid
as
to
certain
types
of
ships,
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yet
there
are
some
ports
in
the
united
states
that
150,000-ton
tanker
just
cannot
get
into
even
though
a
state
were
not
to
prohibit
it,
are
there
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
when
you
talk
about
the
failure
of
the
maritime
administration
to
limit
the
deadweight
of
ships,
that
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
they
contemplated
that
the
larger
ship
they
would
permit
would
necessarily
get
into
any
port
of
the
united
states?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
say
that
under
the
federal
act
the
coastguard
could
set
deadweight
limits
on
tankers?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
it
have
to
set
the
same
limits
for
every
port
in
the
united
states
or
could
it
vary
from
commandant
to
commandant?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
could
have
a
great
deal
of
diversity
of
regulation
under
the
federal
system,
as
you
understand
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
almost
a
constitutional
argument
there
though,
is
it
not,
because
you
have
a
grant
of
authority
by
congress
to
federal
administrative
authorities
like
the
coastguard,
they
choose
to
not
exercise
it
and
then
you
say
it
just
creates
an
intolerable
burden
because
they
have
used
their
discretion
given
to
them
by
congress
not
to
do
something?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
would
be
a
stronger
case
though
if
the
coastguard
had
considered
it
and
rejected
it
to
have
the
state
then
go
ahead
and
add
it
on,
would
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
as
i
understand
the
design
features,
that
requirement
can
be
completely
avoided
by
taking
a
tug
boat?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
mean
if
the
vessel
employs
the
tug
boat,
it
has
to
pay
a
penalty
too?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the
coastguard
is
in
charged
with
administering
this
act
and
if
it
thought
that
purpose
was
being
undermined
as
justice
white
has
suggested,
it
could
prohibit
it
tomorrow
and
it
has
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
cooley
against
the
board
of
wardens,
that
involved
a
requirement
take
on
a
pilot,
does
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
record
shows
one
letter
from
governor
evans
to
the
president.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
indeed,
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
the
statute
contemplates
that
there
would
be
consultation
and
each
time
the
coastguard
adapts
a
regulation
either
under
title
i
or
title
ii,
there
is
an
opportunity
indeed
mandated
for
comment
by
state
and
local
authorities
and
there
has
been
a
wide
pattern
of
comment
by
state
and
local
authorities.
i
would
suggest,
however,
that
the
record
is
absolutely
blank
as
to
the
state
of
washington
ever
asking
that
the
design
requirements
or
the
size
limitation
be
imposed
federally.
