mr.
attorney
general,
how
did
they
happen
to
land
on
that
125,000
deadweight
ton
figure?
did
they
pick
it
out
of
the
air
or
was
there
some
reason
for
it?
unknown
speaker
you
are
not
arguing
then
that
the
state
might
be
able
to
exclude,
say,
tankers
of
50,000,
if
it
landed
on
that
theory?
unknown
speaker
which
are
what?
unknown
speaker
you
are
suggesting
that
until
it
does,
you
are
banning
the
larger
tankers
as
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
what
about
a
licensed
united
states
oil
tanker?
