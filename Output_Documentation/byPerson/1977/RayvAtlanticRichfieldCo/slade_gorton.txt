mr.
slade
gorton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
before
you
is
whether
washington’s
non-discriminatory
exercise
of
its
police
power
to
protect
a
unique
environment
is
preempted
by
the
ports
and
waterways
safety
act
of
1972
or
some
other
federal
doctrine.
in
1972,
the
congress
passed
the
pwsa.
the
object
of
that
act
is
the
safety
of
vessels
and
the
protection
of
our
environment.
title
i
addresses
operational
safety
in
ports,
waterways,
and
other
congested
waters.
it
authorizes,
but
it
does
not
require
the
coastguard
to
establish
vessel
traffic
systems
and
to
mandate
safety
devices
and
standards
for
use
in
connection
with
those
systems.
as
the
solicitor
general
says,
it
is
like
providing
for
safer
highways
and
for
traffic
controls
for
automobiles.
title
ii
directs
the
coastguard,
and
in
this
case
it
directs
it,
to
set
minimum
design
and
construction
standards
for
tankers
and
it
thus,
it
is
thus
in
the
solicitor
general’s
words
“like
providing
for
safer
automobiles.”
in
the
five
years
since
1972,
the
coastguard
has
setup,
pursuant
to
title
i,
a
skeletal
vessel
traffic
system
on
puget
sound.
in
the
coastguard’s
own
words,
its
major
components
are
“a
traffic
separation
scheme
and
a
vessel
moving
reporting
system,”
which
of
course,
supplies
only
to
larger
vessels.
when
vessels
get
here,
they
have
this
system
in
the
direction
of
seattle
and
tacoma
off
of
the
chart
below.
if
they
are
going
to
arco’s
cherry
point
refinery,
they
pass
through
all
of
these
islands
on
this
system
and
here
to
that
cherry
point
refinery.
the
system
also
includes
a
limited
radar
which
does
not
cover
rosario
strait
through
the
islands.
mr.
slade
gorton
i
am
talking
about
the
coastguard’s
radar
to
see
where
the
vessels
all
are.
that
is
about
all.
it
is
a
wild
exaggeration
to
call
this
a
comprehensive
and
all
encompassing
pattern
of
regulation.
because
of
the
urgent
need
for
more
stringent
local
controls
caused
by
the
unique
nature
of
puget
sound,
the
1975
washington
state
legislature
adapted
this
chapter
125,
the
law
here
under
challenge.
that
statute,
based
on
a
well-founded
fear
of
a
disaster
comparable
to
that
of
the
torrey
canyon,
limited
the
maximum
risk
from
the
most
disastrous
possible
oil
spill
by
prohibiting
tankers
of
more
than
125,000
tons
from
puget
sound
entirely,
the
line
drawn
by
the
legislature
being
roughly
like
that.
the
legislature
sought
to
minimize
the
risks
of
any
oil
spill
in
puget
sound
by
requiring
a
tug
escort
for
tankers
between
40
and
125,000
tons
unless
they
are
designed
in
such
a
manner
as
to
render
a
tug
escort
unnecessary.
these
requirements
are
based
on
the
confined
nature
of
puget
sound,
the
lack
of
maneuverability
of
large
tankers
and
the
near
impossibility
of
the
cleanup
of
a
major
oil
spill
in
an
area,
including
196
islands
in
san
juan
county
alone.
mr.
slade
gorton
there
was
considerable
discussion
in
the
legislative
debate
over
the
appropriate
largest
tanker
which
should
be
permitted
to
go
through
the
sound.
a
225,000-ton
tanker,
for
example,
probably
could
not
get
through
rosario
straits
at
all
loaded
because
it
would
draw
too
much
water.
but
i
believe
that
they
simple
debated
over
the
proposition
that
at
a
given
size,
a
major
spill,
a
spill
which
lost
all
of
the
oil
on
board
would
totally
ruin
the
entire
area.
the
state
would
lack
any
reasonable
cleanup
facilities
to
take
care
of
such
a
spill.
they
hope
that
between
40
and
125,000
tons,
even
with
a
major
one,
the
disaster
would
not
be
an
irretrievable
one.
mr.
slade
gorton
the
question
before
you
would
be
much
different
and
much
more
difficult
for
me
under
those
circumstances,
your
honor.
very
few
125,000-ton
tankers
ever
entered
puget
sound
before
this.
we
are
concerned
with
the
fact
that
there
are
six
refineries
on
puget
sound.
they
must
be
supplied
more
by
tanker
now
because
of
the
fact
that
the
canadians
have
cut
off
the
pipeline
to
cherry
point.
the
two
years
that
we
have
enforced
this
law,
all
of
those
refineries
on
puget
sound
have,
in
fact,
been
supplied
by
tankers
of
less
than
125,000
tons
to
the
full
extent
of
their
needs.
mr.
slade
gorton
two
refineries
are
here,
two
refineries
are
here,
and
two
refineries
are
in
tacoma
which
is
awfully
sharp
to
the
south.
mr.
slade
gorton
one,
arco’s.
now,
there
is
another
point.
even
the
solicitor
general
fails
clearly
in
his
brief
to
distinguish
between
puget
sound
and
all
of
the
other
waters
and
coastlines
of
the
state
of
washington
to
which
this
law
does
not
apply
because
the
legislature
was
making
a
careful
value
judgment,
leaving
open
to
the
larger
tankers,
should
there
be
a
major
tanker
port
in
the
future,
the
strait
of
juan
de
fuca
and
the
pacific
ocean
coastline
of
the
state.
in
the
more
than
two
years,
since
the
passage
of
125,
as
i
said,
those
six
refineries
have
gotten
all
the
petroleum
products
they
needed,
operating
totally
consistently
with
the
state
law
which
has
been
enforced
all
that
time.
mr.
slade
gorton
the
legislature
defined
the
language
i
have
drawn
here
from
a
particular
like
to
another
particular
like.
in
1972,
right
after
the
pwsa,
the
congress
also
passed
the
coastal
zone
management
act
which
authorizes
coastal
states
to
define
and
i
am
quoting
from
that
act,
“permissible
land
and
water
uses
within
the
coastal
zone.”
transportation
and
navigation
are
among
the
uses
expressly
recognized
by
the
ccma
as
proper
subjects
of
the
state
management
program.
upon
approval
by
the
secretary
of
commerce,
the
state
plan
becomes
national
policy
and
other
federal
agencies
are
required
to
conduct
their
activities
in
a
manner
consistent
with
the
state
plan.
the
washington
state
plan
explicitly
includes
chapter
125
as
a
“means
by
which
the
state
proposes
to
exert
control”
over
oil
transportation.
in
june
of
last
year,
the
plan
was
expressly
approved
by
the
secretary
of
commerce.
finally,
earlier
this
month,
since
all
briefs
except
our
reply
brief
was
filed,
the
congress
approved
s1522
which
bars
any
increase
in
crude
oil
handling
capacity
at
any
facility
in
the
state
east
of
port
angeles,
right
here,
except
for
local
consumption.
arco’s
proposal
to
utilize
a
pipeline
to
the
midwest
for
alaskan
oil
has
thus
been
effectively
prohibited.
s1522,
like
chapter
125,
treats
puget
sound
as
unique
and
recognizes
the
threat
of
pollution
posed
by
tanker
traffic
in
the
sound.
now,
the
state’s
law
will
be
avoided
of
course,
if
congress
has
expressly
preempted
it
or
if
it
conflicts
with
some
federal
statute.
the
beginning
point
of
your
inquiry
into
that
question
is
explained
in
jones
v.
rath
packing
in
the
following
words.
“we
start
with
the
assumption
that
the
historic
police
powers
of
the
states
are
not
to
be
superseded
by
the
federal
act
unless
that
was
the
clear
and
manifest
purpose
of
congress,
but
when
congress
has
unmistakably
ordained
that
its
enactments
alone
are
to
regulate
a
part
of
commerce,
state
laws
regulating
that
aspect
of
commerce
must
fall.”
we
start
with
the
obvious
proposition
that
the
congress
did
not
expressly
preempt
all
forms
of
state
control
over
tanker
operations
by
the
passage
of
the
ports
and
waterways
safety
act.
the
only
reference
in
the
pwsa,
arguably
indicating
an
intention
by
the
congress
to
preempt
state
authority
is
found
in
section
102
(b)
which
contains
no
express
preemption
at
all,
but
only
a
negative
inference
and
i
quote
that
section.
“nothing
contained
in
title
i
prevents
a
state
from
prescribing,
for
structures
only,
higher
safety
equipment
requirements
or
safety
standards,
then
those
which
may
be
prescribed
pursuant
to
this
act.”
arco
claims
that
the
plain
meaning
of
that
language
preempts
any
state
rule
affecting
tanker
operations
ipso
facto,
not
so.
let
us
examine
the
inevitable
results
of
arco’s
argument.
first,
it
would
destroy
a
state-managed
vessel
traffic
system
even
though
the
coastguard
never
setup
its
own
system
in
replacement,
but
section
102
(e)
of
the
act
requires
the
coastguard
to
consider
existing
systems
in
determining
the
need
for
or
the
substance
of
the
coastguard’s
own
regulation
from
which
it
is
obvious
that
local
systems
are
valid
at
least
until
the
coastguard
supersedes
them.
next,
arco’s
assertion
flies
in
the
face
of
the
plain
language
of
section
102
(b)
itself
which
limits
the
state
only
to
the
extent
that
standards
or
equipment
have
been
prescribed,
in
the
words
of
section
102
(b)
by
the
coastguard.
the
coastguard
has
not
adapted
general
access
limitations
or
tug
escort
provisions
on
puget
sound.
mr.
slade
gorton
why
did
they
say
“structures
only?”
from
the
legislative
history
of
that
act,
it
was
speaking
of
equipment
and
standards
which
go
on
the
vessels;
their
radar
systems,
their
crew
manning
requirements,
vessel
equipment,
and
safety
standards.
these
are
what
go
on
the
vessels.
the
paragraphs
in
the
congressional
report
on
it
indicate
that
kind
of
limitation.
mr.
slade
gorton
in
that
area,
yes.
we
cannot
say
what
brand
or
radar
or
radio
that
the
vessels
are
carrying.
moreover,
as
the
solicitor
general
says,
the
legislative
history
of
section
102
(b)
shows
that
it
deals
only
with
these
safety
equipment
standards
and
not
with
externals
such
as
tug
escorts
or
access
limitations.
finally,
arco’s
position,
if
we
look
at
that
section
very
carefully,
would
not
allow
the
state
even
to
enforce
its
shoreline
zoning
requirements
as
to
loading
docks,
for
example,
on
strictly
environmental
grounds
because
such
regulations
would
not
be
the
safety
requirements
to
which
arco
believes
the
savings
clause
in
section
102
(b)
is
very
strictly
limited.
the
true
meaning
of
section
102
(b)
is
clear.
when
the
coastguard
establishes
a
vessel
traffic
system
on
a
waterway,
a
state
may
not
establish
a
conflicting
system
or
require
the
use
of
different
radio
frequencies,
for
example.
when
the
coastguard
prescribes
a
given
type
of
radar,
the
state
may
not
prescribe
a
different
type.
thus,
we,
on
this
subject,
are
in
accord
with
both
the
district
court
and
the
solicitor
general.
the
pwsa
does
not
expressly
preempt
chapter
125,
but
in
your
preemption
analysis
in
jones
v.
rath
packing,
you
go
into
a
further
test
and
i
will
quote
that.
“our
task
is
to
determine
whether
under
the
circumstances
of
this
particular
case,
the
state’s
law
stands
as
an
obstacle
to
the
accomplishment
and
execution
of
the
full
purposes
and
objectives
of
congress.
this
inquiry
requires
us
to
consider
the
relationship
between
state
and
federal
laws
as
they
are
interpreted
and
applied
not
merely
as
they
are
written.”
the
purposes
of
the
ports
and
waterways
safety
act,
as
they
are
stated
in
section
101,
are
safety
and
the
prevention
of
environmental
harm
resulting
from
vessel
damage
or
destruction.
the
purposes
of
the
state
act
are
identical.
not
only
does
it
frustrate
the
purposes
of
congress,
it
facilitates
and
enhances
them.
the
means
which
the
state
act
uses
to
achieve
those
purposes
are
also
consistent
with
the
pwsa.
there
is
no
conflict
or
friction
between
the
coastguard
vessel
traffic
system
as
it
operates
in
practice
on
puget
sound
and
the
state
requirements
as
they
are
actually
carried
out.
for
more
than
two
years
those
systems
have
worked
in
total
harmony.
in
fact,
the
commandant
of
the
coastguard
recently
testified
to
congress
pointing
out
that
state
tug
escort
requirements
are
but
one
example
of
appropriate
complimentary
state
regulation.
i
should
like
you
to
note
that
the
state’s
claim
here
is
an
extremely
modest
one.
we
recognize
that
congress
can
preempt
chapter
125
whenever
it
wishes
to
do
so.
we
assert
only
that
it
is
not
done
so
yet.
we
acknowledge
that
the
coastguard,
by
adapting
a
valid
regulation
conflicting
with
the
state
statute,
can
supersede
either
or
both
of
the
operative
requirements
of
chapter
125.
mr.
slade
gorton
which,
are
the
access
limit
and
the
tug
escort
requirements.
mr.
slade
gorton
well,
when
the
coastguard
passes
a
regulation
which
conflicts
with
that
ban,
then
we
are
out.
we
understand
that.
we
do
not
even
--
mr.
slade
gorton
under
the
general
enrollment
act,
we
do
not
feel
that
a
license
or
a
registration
either
to
a
us-flag
or
a
foreign-flag
tanker
is
in
any
way
conflicting,
going
all
the
way
back
to
gibbons
v.
ogden
and
all
the
way
forward
to
your
latest
casein
this
--
mr.
slade
gorton
your
cases
have
consistently
held
that
even
a
license
to
a
us
flag
vessel
does
not
prevent
the
state
from
enforcing
an
even-handed
conservation
or
environmental
regulation,
even-handed,
that
is
to
say
applicable
to
everyone.
we
are
only
claiming
even
here
that
the
incomplete
and
fragmentary
coastguard
rules
and
traffic
system
on
puget
sound
has
not
yet
superseded
our
state
rules.
arco
goes
on,
of
course,
to
argue
preemption
beyond
section
102
on
a
more
general
and
less
precise
grounds,
the
need
for
uniformed
national
standards,
the
nature
of
the
subject
matter,
the
dominance
of
the
federal
interest.
in
this
field,
arco
elevates
its
preemption
argument
to
the
constitution
independently
of
the
pwsa,
claiming
that
the
field
of
chapter
125
is
one
which
the
state
constitutionally
cannot
regulate
even
if
congress
has
not
occupied
it.
note
well
how
broad
and
expensive
this
claim
is.
if
it
is
accepted,
the
states
could
not
protect
its
environment
as
washington
has
even
if
congress
had
not
acted
at
all
or
perhaps
even
if
congress
had
expressly
attempted
to
delegate
that
authority
to
the
states.
the
very
pilotage
laws
of
1789
which
were
approved
in
cooley
v.
board
of
wardens
would
be
unconstitutional
under
that
argument
as
they
dealt
with
vessel
operations
exactly
as
our
tug
escort
requirements
do
which
arco
claim
requires
uniform
national
standards.
in
this
argument,
arco
equates
the
design
and
construction
of
oil
tankers
with
their
movement
in
local
waters,
but
whatever
one
may
say
about
design
and
construction,
local
movement
is
inherently
and
inevitably
a
local
concern.
for
almost
two
centuries,
this
court
has
allowed
the
enforcement
of
local
regulations
on
matters
of
local
concern
as
long
as
they
do
not
positively
conflict
with
federal
law.
as
gilmore
and
black
have
put
it,
the
states
have
enacted
“massive
legislation
dealing
with
shipping
matters.”
such
legislation
which
has
been
approved
by
this
court
includes
quarantine
regulations,
docking,
local
speed
controls,
vessel
inspection,
and
conservation
legislation
designed
to
protect
the
environment.
title
i
of
the
ports
and
waterways
safety
act
itself
recognizes
the
existence
and
validity
of
such
legislation
and
is
careful
to
speak
of
possible
preemption
only
on
the
basis
of
the
actual
effect
of
coastguard
regulation.
finally,
the
coastal
zone
management
act
invites
state
plans
which
deal
with
navigation
matters
and
allows
the
secretary
of
transportation
to
transmute
them
into
federal
policy.
no
resort
to
a
demand
for
so-called
uniformity
standing
in
the
air
can
withstand
that
this
specific
congressional
recognition
of
local
concerns.
the
test
of
preemption,
as
it
applies
to
regulation
such
as
washington’s,
is
not
a
vague
appeal
to
the
need
for
national
uniformity,
but
actual
conflict.
to
the
extent
that
this
case
is
governed
by
the
ports
and
waterways
safety
act,
this
entire
controversy
revolves
around
title
i
of
that
act
and
not
title
ii.
it
is
in
treating
the
access
limitation
as
a
design
control
that
both
arco
and
the
solicitor
general
err.
conceptually,
design
precedes
even
construction
in
the
life
of
a
tanker.
washington
state
does
not
require
any
design
features.
were
the
coastguard
to
establish
an
access
limitation
based
on
size
in
puget
sound,
like
or
conflicting
with
our
own,
for
safety
or
environmental
reasons,
it
would
act
under
title
i
of
the
pwsa,
not
the
design
standards
of
title
ii.
this
misconception
together
with
one
other
leads
the
solicitor
general
to
view
the
state’s
access
limitation
less
favorably
than
he
does
the
tug
escort
requirements.
that
second
misconception
is
that
the
proposition
that
large
tankers
cause
a
greater
risk
of
oil
spills
than
smaller
ones
is
unreasonable,
thus,
causing
our
access
limitation
to
fall.
now,
the
parties
stipulated,
this
case
was
tried
on
a
stipulation,
to
the
existence
of
expert
support
for
the
proposition
that
large
tankers
were
less
safe,
disputed
though
it
may
be
and
its
reasonableness
was
never
an
issue
between
the
parties,
but
as
i
have
already
said
that
there
is
emphasis.
the
legislature
had
an
additional
rationale
which
is
not
even
subject
to
dispute.
supertankers
clearly
cause
a
risk
of
greater
spills
and
the
state
wishes
to
place
a
reasonable
ceiling
on
the
most
serious
oil
spill
disaster
to
which
puget
sound
may
be
subjected.
that
is
a
rationale
concern
and
justifies
the
state’s
regulation
unless
and
until
it
conflicts
with
another
established
or
authorized
by
congress.
your
line
of
cases
to
which
mr.
justice
blackmun
adverted
in
his
question
on
the
enrollment
and
registrations
statutes,
clearly
permit
an
even-handed
state
regulation
for
environmental
purposes
way
back
to
the
cases
first
coming
after
gibbons
v.
ogden,
manchester
v.
massachusetts
is
one
of
those.
interestingly
enough,
your
most
recent
case
in
the
field
of
preemption
deals
with
exactly
that
question.
mr.
justice
marshall,
speaking
for
the
court,
wrote
in
douglas
v.
seacoast
products
less
than
six
months
ago,
“states
may
impose
even
upon
federal
licensees,
reasonable
non-discriminatory
conservation
and
environmental
protection
measures,
otherwise,
within
their
police
power.”
that
is
all
we
have
done
in
the
state
of
washington
and
we
should
not
be
only
tolerated
in
that
attempt
to
protect
our
environment,
we
should
be
encouraged.
mr.
slade
gorton
yes,
it
is
because
it
conflicts
with
federal
law
and
that
has
not
been
an
issue
in
this
case.
i
will
reserve,
if
i
may.
mr.
slade
gorton
no,
mr.
justice
white,
the
coastguard
has
not
addressed
this
subject.
the
coastguard,
first,
has
delegated
the
course
to
each
of
its
commanders
the
ability
to
write
rules.
under
those
rules,
of
course,
the
puget
sound
vtc
is
created.
there
is
one
--
mr.
slade
gorton
arco
claims
that
the
coastguard
has
entered
this
field
because
of
a
local
rule.
in
this
case,
a
local
rule
which
says
that
the
vtc
will
coordinate
vessel
movements
to
avoid
hazardous
meetings
or
crossing
situations.
masters
and
pilots
are
encouraged,
and
this
is
all
they
say,
to
adjust
the
speed
of
their
vessels
so
as
to
limit
movement
of
large
vessels
through
rosario
strait
to
one
direction
at
a
time.
it
is
found
in
the
pretrial
order.
it
is
agreed
that
there
is
an
informal,
it
is
not
even
written,
coastguard
rule
that
two
70,000-ton
tankers
will
not
pass
one
another
going
in
either
direction
in
rosario
strait,
but
that,
of
course,
is
not
remotely
inconsistent
with
our
greater
concern
and
that,
of
course,
applies
not
only
to
tankers,
but
to
every
other
kind
of
shipping.
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
if
i
may.
mr.
slade
gorton
in
its
report
which
accompanied
the
passage
of
the
ports
and
waterways
safety
act,
the
senate
stated
“in
terms
of
maneuverability,
the
propulsion
units
on
250,000-ton
tankers
are
the
equivalent
to
1/3
horsepower
motor
on
a
40-foot
boat.”
this
is
something
of
which
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
washington
was
conscious
when
it
passed
this
law.
the
controlling
depth
of
rosario
strait
is
60-feet
and
a
120,000-ton
tanker
has
a
draft
of
52-feet
loaded.
by
the
time
we
get
to
190,000
deadweight
tons,
it
becomes
61-feet.
the
state
legislature
wished
at
least
that
small
margin
of
safety
and
finally
--
mr.
slade
gorton
of
course
it
is
and
that
is
from
the
senate
report.
there
are
obviously
less
maneuverability
over
the
smaller
craft.
it
takes,
for
example,
even
at
120,000-ton
size
2.5
miles
to
stop
a
tanker
at
16
knots.
by
the
time
the
tanker
is
190,000
tons,
it
takes
3.5
miles
to
stop
it.
mr.
slade
gorton
i
doubt
it,
they
cannot
among
other
things
mr.
chief
justice
because
they
are
required
to
have
tug
escorts
and
the
tug
escorts
could
not
keep
up
with
them
at
16
knots.
that
is,
effectively,
we
slow
them
down
with
the
tug
escort
requirement.
mr.
slade
gorton
it
would
be.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
might
be
less
than
the
1/3
horsepower
of
a
40-foot
boat,
but
the
canoe,
well,
it
might
put
you
in
danger,
but
it
would
not
put
the
environment
in
danger.
mr.
slade
gorton
no,
it
is
not
an
absolute
straight
line
comparison.
mr.
sherwood
referred
to
16
states
which
are
waiting
in
the
wings
to
pass
highly
inconsistent
legislation
from
that
of
the
state
of
washington.
the
simple
answer
to
that
question,
under
the
pwsa,
is
that
the
minute
one
of
those
states
passes
a
statute
which
creates
a
true,
rather
than
a
fictional
conflict
with
those
of
the
state
of
washington
and
trade
which
involves
the
two,
the
coastguard
will
have
the
immediate
power
to
step
in
and
resolve
it
overriding
either
our
regulation
or
that
of
the
state
or
both,
but
that
situation
simply
has
not
taken
place
yet
and
may
well
never
take
place.
mr.
slade
gorton
precisely,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
coastguard
wishes
to
do
so.
remember,
neither
the
district
court
nor
this
court
has
permitted
an
injunction
during
the
course
of
this
litigation
to
prohibit
our
state
from
enforcing
the
law.
it
has
been
enforced
since
it
went
into
effect
in
1975.
the
coastguard
has
been
obviously
totally
aware
of
it.
the
coastguard
has
obviously,
by
its
lack
of
action,
taken
it
as
being
consistent
with
its
own
regulation.
the
commandant
of
the
coastguard,
in
testifying
before
the
congress
quite
recently,
spoke
of
the
tug
escort
requirement
as
being
just
one
form
of
complimentary
state
regulation.
so
we
built
up
a
totally
fictional
conflict
here.
finally,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
asked
mr.
sherwood
whether
or
not
there
was
some
penalty
in
connection
with
the
tug
escort
requirements
for
not
meeting
the
design
desires
of
the
state
of
washington
and
i
do
not
believe
he
got
an
answer
to
that.
there
is
of
course,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
no
such
penalty.
it
is
simply
a
quaint
characterization
by
arco
of
the
tug
escort
requirements
which
are
valid
and
important
environmental
protection
measure.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
