as
i
understand,
your
argument
is
that
you
can
build
the
tanker
size
you
want,
the
state
is
powerless
to
keep
it
out
as
of
today?
justice
thurgood
marshall
even
though
it
will
wreck
havoc,
even
though
there
is
no
question
that
the
bottom
will
be
ripped
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
is
my
hypothetical?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
the
coastguard
does
not
act,
the
state
is
powerless?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
the
state
pass
a
law
and
say
â€œwe
will
not
allow
any
tankers
in
puget
sound
in
which
there
is
a
record
of
them
having
their
bottom
ripped
out
some
place
else?'
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
the
state
just
lets
them
come
in
and
rip
the
bottom
of
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
until
that
is
done,
the
state
cannot
act?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
this
case,
they
did,
the
coastguard
and
the
state
did
get
together
on
rosario?
justice
thurgood
marshall
none
at
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
see.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
sherwood,
but
will
you
not
agree
that
a
large
tanker
is
less
maneuverable
than
a
small
tanker?
justice
thurgood
marshall
less
maneuverable.
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
you
agree
that
in
puget
sound
and
in
rosario
straits,
a
huge
tanker
is
less
maneuverable
than
a
small
tanker?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
not
true
in
average
maritime
collision
case
you
find
that
the
larger
ship
is
less
maneuverable?
it
could
be
griffin
on
collisions,
is
that
not
what
griffin
said?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
what
you
say
is
that
you
have
a
large
ship
with
a
perfect
steering
mechanism
and
a
small
ship
with
a
beat
up
one,
that
they
are
equal.
i
am
considering
that
they
both
are
equally
well
efficiently
equipped
and
staffed
and
sober?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
if
they
have
a
single
file
in
the
strait?
