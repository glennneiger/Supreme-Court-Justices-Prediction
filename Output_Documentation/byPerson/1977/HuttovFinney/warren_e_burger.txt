chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
76-1660,
hutto
against
finney.
mr.
taylor
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
referred,
the
bad
faith
conclusions
reached
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
guess
by
the
district
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
challenge
those
determinations,
i
take
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
the
department
of
corrections
here,
is
the
department
of
party
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
they
try
to
intervene,
the
department
of
corrections
try
to
intervene
to
challenge
the
court's
jurisdiction
to
enter
a
judgment
against
it,
when
it
was
not
a
party?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
under
your
present
statute,
would
the
payment
not,
reimbursements
should
not
be
barred
by
the
finding
of
bad
faith?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
the
court
had
found
that
the
this
violated
the
eight
amendment,
then
do
you
say
the
court
would
have
no
power
to
limit
the
solitary
confinement,
assuming
the
correct
finding
of
violation
of
the
eight
amendment?
now,
you
told
us
that
the
court
did
not
find
a
violation,
any
constitutional
violation
here,
have
you
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
my
question
was
directed
at
your
previous
statement
that
the
court
had
not
found
a
constitutional
violation
and
which
does
not
seem
to
be
consistent
with
the
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
wish
to
reserve
any
time
for
rebuttal,
your
signal
is
on
for
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
kaplan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
not
true
now,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
you
arguing
this
now
in
the
support
of
the
bad
faith
finding
or
what
is
the
purpose
of
--?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
(inaudible)
indicated
that
we
did
not
need
any
more
on
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may
respond
to
that
at
1
o'
clock
counsel.[recess]
mr.
kaplan
you
may
resume
your
arguments.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
a
question
pending
from
the
bench,
i
think?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
perhaps
you
better
address
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
who
should
decide
the
issue
that
you
have
just
raised?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
a
periodic
re-examination?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
they
still
cannot
impose
the
sentence
of
more
than
30
days?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
according
to
him,
under
the
united
states
constitution
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
clause,
they
cannot
impose
this
kind
of
sentence
for
more
than
30
days?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
do
you
think
he
made
this
cruel
unusual
punishment
ruling
on
the
assumption
that
the
other
parts
of
his
order
would
not
be
carried
out?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
he
wanted
to
limit
the
confinement,
the
solitary
confinement
to
30
days,
was
it
necessary
for
him
to
reach
the
constitutional
issue?
could
he
not
have
decided,
for
example,
under
the
holding
of
this
court
in
the
service
case
that
the
state
was
obliged
to
live
up
to
its
own
rules?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
rule,
the
enforcement
of
the
rules
would
take
care
of
that,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
do
we
find
that
in
this
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
speaking
now
of
fees,
other
than
the
ones
that
are
before
us?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
you
have
a
few
minutes
left
if
you
have
anything
further.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
hutto
against
finney
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
stevens.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
stevens.
