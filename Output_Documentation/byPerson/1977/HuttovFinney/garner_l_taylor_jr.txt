mr.
garner
l.
taylor,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
fundamental
issues
for
the
court's
consideration,
involving
the
eighth
and
eleventh
amendments
to
united
states
constitution.
the
case
arose
out
of
litigation
concerning
the
operation
of
the
arkansas
prison
system.
a
number
of
petitions
that
had
been
filed
by
inmates
in
the
prison
system
were
consolidated
by
the
district
court.
a
counsel
was
appointed
to
represent
them
and
an
amended
and
substitute
complaint
was
filed,
seeking
relief
under
title
xxxxii
of
the
united
states
code,
section
1983.
there
are
three
issues
which
we
ask
the
court
to
consider.
first
of
all,
whether
congress
in
passing
the
civil
rights
attorney's
fees
awards
act
of
1976
abrogated
the
state's
eleventh
amendment
immunity
and
thereby
authorized
an
award
of
attorney's
fees
to
be
paid
from
the
funds
of
a
state
agency,
that
was
not
made
a
party
to
the
litigation.
as
a
corollary
to
this
first
argument,
we
suggest
that
even
if
the
court
should
find
that
congress
did
abrogate
the
state's
eleventh
amendment
immunity
that,
that
act
should
not
be
given
retroactive
application
in
this
particular
case
because
it
would
work
in
manifesting
justice.
secondly,
we
ask
the
court
to
consider
whether
the
eleventh
amendment
bars
an
award
of
attorney's
fees
based
upon
a
finding
of
bad
faith,
against
the
state
or
state
agency.
finally,
we
asked
the
court
to
consider
whether
the
lower
courts
were
correct
in
ruling
that
indefinite
punitive
confinement
of
recalcitrant
inmates
is
unconstitutional.
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
was
entered
on
march
19th
of
1976.
it
is
found
at
page
141
in
the
appendix.
it
awarded,
the
district
court
awarded
an
attorney's
fee
of
$20,000
to
court
appointed
attorneys
for
the
inmates
and
ordered
that
that
fee
be
paid
from
the
funds
of
the
department
of
correction.
now,
the
department
of
correction
had
never
been
made
a
party
to
the
litigation.
the
action
was
filed,
of
course,
a
1983
action
can
be
filed
directly
against
the
state
under
court
decisions,
the
action
was
filed
against
the
correction's
commissioner
and
the
members
of
the
board
of
correction.
the
court
held
that
such
an
award
would
have
only
an
ancillary
effect
on
the
state
treasury,
citing
this
court's
opinion
in
the
case
of
edelman
v.
jordan.
furthermore,
the
court
found
that
the
award
was
justified
under
the
bad
faith
exception
to
the
american
rule
which
was
discussed
by
this
court
in
its
recent
opinion
in
alyeska
pipeline
service
co.
v.
wilderness
society.
the
eighth
circuit
affirmed
this
award
and
noted
in
its
opinion
that
subsequent
to
the
district
court's
decision,
the
civil
rights
attorney's
fees
awards
act
of
1976
had
been
approved,
that
act
was
approved
on
october
19th
of
1976
and
the
eighth
circuit
held
that
the
award
of
attorney's
fees
was
proper
under
that
act
and
was
not
barred
by
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity
of
the
state
arkansas.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
civil
rights
attorney's
fees
awards
act
of
1976
did
not
operate
to
abrogate
the
immunity
of
the
state
of
arkansas
to
monetary
judgment.
because
in
passing
the
civil
rights
attorney's
fees
awards
act
of
76,
congress
did
not
amend
section
1983
of
title
xxxxii
to
include
a
state
within
the
meaning
of
the
term
person.
therefore,
the
threshold
fact
of
congressional
authorization
which
this
court
found
present
in
fitzpatrick
v.
bitzer,
was
not
present
in
this
particular
case.
the
state
was
not
a
party
to
the
action.
the
department
of
correction
was
not
a
party
to
the
action
and
in
effect
the
court
lacked
jurisdiction
over
this
department
of
correction
and
had
no
jurisdiction
to
order
an
award
of
attorney's
fees.
in
fitzpatrick,
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
had
been
expressly
amended,
to
subject
governments
and
governmental
agencies
and
political
sub-divisions
to
suit
under
that
section.
but
the
present
case
--
in
the
present
case,
1983
was
not
specifically
amended
and
this
case
more
closely
resembles
the
decision
in
employees
v.
missouri
public
health
department,
a
case
in
which
this
court
held
that
congress
had
not
abrogated
the
state's
immunity
because
it
did
not
specifically
amended
section
16
(b)
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
to
include
a
state
within
the
meaning
of
the
term,
any
employer,
when
it
enacted
amendments
in
1966.
even
if
congress
had
tried
to
abrogate
the
state's
eleventh
amendment
immunity
in
passing
the
act
it
failed
to
do
so,
because
when
congress
acts
to
abrogate
a
state's
immunity
in
a
unilateral
fashion,
that
is
without
a
waiver
on
the
part
of
the
state,
pursuant
to
the
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
when
congress
acts
to
abrogate
a
state's
immunity
pursuant
to
section
5,
it
should
do
so
in
explicit
statutory
language.
the
legislative
history
of
this
act
does
not
need
to
consulted
because
there
is
no
ambiguity
on
the
face
of
the
act.
if
--
mr.
garner
l.
taylor,
jr.
yes
sir,
but
it
is
our
position
that
congress
simply
misinterpreted
the
decision
of
this
court
in
fitzpatrick
v.
bitzer
and
congress
did
not
do
what
they
had
to
do
to
abrogate
the
state's
immunity.
they
did
not
amend
section
1983
to
include
a
state
within
the
meaning
of
the
term
person.
mr.
garner
l.
taylor,
jr.
it
is
our
position
that
the
committee
reports
--
of
course
the
court
can
look
at
them
and
consider
them,
but
there
is
really
no
need
to
because
there
is
ambiguity
on
the
face
of
this
particular
statute.
if
congress
was
so
certain
that
they
had
effectively
abrogated
the
state's
eleventh
amendment
immunity,
it
seems
strange
that
there
is
now
bill
pending
in
the
senate,
senate
bill
35
which
will
specifically
amend
section
1983,
to
define
the
term
person
as
any
individual
state,
municipality
or
any
agency
or
unit
of
government
of
the
state.
mr.
garner
l.
taylor,
jr.
this
is
pending
now
sir,
it
was
introduced
on
january
the
10th
this
year.
mr.
garner
l.
taylor,
jr.
sir,
i
am
not
certain
whether
or
not
the
bill
--
mr.
garner
l.
taylor,
jr.
your
honor,
i
believe
a
more
correct
assumption
might
be
that
the
fact
that
this
bill
pending
now,
indicates
that
congress
is
not
certain,
that
it
followed
the
guidelines
set
forth
by
this
court
when
it
--
mr.
garner
l.
taylor,
jr.
in
fitzpatrick
v.
bitzer,
your
honor,
this
court
held
that
congress
may
act,
but
congress
in
that
instance
acted
by
explicit
statutory
language,
by
explicitly
--
mr.
garner
l.
taylor,
jr.
no
sir,
i
do
not
think
it
should
because
we
are
talking
about
a
very
fundamental
concept
of
--
mr.
garner
l.
taylor,
jr.
your
honor,
as
a
general
proposition
there
--
court's
hold
that
in
statutory
construction,
it
is
not
necessary
to
refer
to
the
legislative
history
unless
there
is
some
ambiguity.
mr.
garner
l.
taylor,
jr.
no
sir,
although
i
suspect
that
the
court
will
look
at
the
legislative
history
in
this
particular
instance.
mr.
garner
l.
taylor,
jr.
the
legislative
history
does
indicate
the
intent
of
congress
to
abrogate
your
honor,
but
it
is
our
position
that
congress,
even
though
it
may
have
tried
to
abrogate
the
state's
immunity
simply
botched
the
job.
they
simply
did
not
do
what
they
had
to
do
to
abrogate
the
state's
eleventh
amendment
immunity
because
here
we
are
dealing
with
some
very
fundamental
constitutional
issues
in
a
very
delicate
balance
of
the
relationship
between
the
states
and
our
national
government
and
our
system
of
government.
the
eleventh
amendment
is
fundamental
to
that
relationship
and
it
is
our
position
that
when
congress
acts
to
abrogate
that
immunity,
it
should
do
so
in
explicit
statutory
language,
so
there
will
be
no
confusion
as
it
is
now
across
our
country
as
to
whether
or
not
states
are
liable
for
attorney's
fees
under
the
provisions
of
this
act.
if
congress
had
acted
by
enacting
a
statute
with
explicit
language,
there
would
not
be
the
kind
of
confusion
we
see
right
now
and
in
this
case
there
is
no
waiver
by
the
state
of
arkansas,
no
waiver
expressed
or
implied
in
edelman
v.
jordon.
this
court
held
that
the
eleventh
amendment
barred
an
award
of
retroactive
benefits
under
a
federal
state
program
for
the
aged
blind
and
disabled
and
the
term
ancillary
effect
was
discussed
by
the
court
in
that
opinion.
ancillary
effect
refers
to
the
fiscal
consequences
that
a
state
may
expect
in
complying
with
injunctive
relief
granted
by
a
court
in
the
future.
it
is
a
perspective
effect.
for
example,
in
this
particular
case,
an
ancillary
effect
of
the
district
court's
decree
might
be
the
fact
that
the
state
of
arkansas
had
to
spend
over
half
a
million
dollars
to
build
a
new
maximum
security
unit,
but
an
ancillary
effect
would
not
be
the
award
of
attorney's
fees.
that
would
be
a
direct
effect
upon
the
state
treasury.
so
the
district
court's
determination
that
the
award
of
$20,000
in
attorney's
fees
was
an
ancillary
effect
is
misplaced
under
the
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
garner
l.
taylor,
jr.
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
so
because
the
attorney's
fees
awards
act
had
not
been
passed
at
the
time
this
decision
was
made,
the
award
was
made.
mr.
garner
l.
taylor,
jr.
our
argument
will
still
be
that
it
should
not
your
honor
because
we
do
not
feel
like
the
act
should
be
applied
retroactively
because
to
do
that
will
result
in
manifesting
justice
to
the
parties.
mr.
garner
l.
taylor,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
garner
l.
taylor,
jr.
to
them
individually
i
do
not
suppose
it
makes
a
great
deal
of
difference
other
than
the
fact
that,
well,
of
course
we
are
talking
about--
mr.
garner
l.
taylor,
jr.
if
this
is
sent
back
to
the
trial
judge?
mr.
garner
l.
taylor,
jr.
that
is
a
possibility,
but
not
under
the
court's
determination
that
we
are,
we
have
right
now,
the
court
--
mr.
garner
l.
taylor,
jr.
your
honor,
i
do
not
know
what
the
court
would
say
in
that
instance
because
it
ordered
the
fee
to
be
paid
out
of
the
departments
of
correction's
funds
and
in
effect
made
a
finding
of
bad
faith
on
the
part
of
the
department
of
correction.
mr.
garner
l.
taylor,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
garner
l.
taylor,
jr.
yes
sir
i
think
so
because
they
were
sued
in
their
official
capacity
as
well
as
individually
and
in
their
official
capacities
we
have
sued
the
commissioner
of
corrections
and
the
board
of
corrections
and
the
court's
order,
order
that
the
fees
be
paid
out
of
the
funds
of
the
department
of
corrections,
which
they
control
in
their
official
capacities.
so
we
have
to
--
mr.
garner
l.
taylor,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
garner
l.
taylor,
jr.
the
judge
could
order
the
individuals
to
pay
the
fees,
if
the
act
applies,
if
the
court
gives
retroactive
application
to
the
act,
but
to
do
that,
would
definitely
result
in
a
manifesting
justices
as
you
have
just
pointed
out,
to
give
retroactive
affect
to
this
act
under
the
holding
of
this
court
in
bradley
v.
school
board,
bradley
v.
school
board
of
the
city
of
richmond.
mr.
garner
l.
taylor,
jr.
yes
sir
and
we
can
test
that
finding,
bad
faith
does
not
just
--
mr.
garner
l.
taylor,
jr.
the
court
of
appeals
footnoted
it.
the
district
court
held
on
the
basis
of
the
bad
faith.
the
eight
circuit,
in
the
interim,
the
civil
rights
attorneys
fees
act
in
1976
was
passed
and
the
district
court
or
rather
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed
based
upon
that
particular
act.
although,
the
circuit
court
did
note
in
a
footnote
that
they
thought
the
finding
of
bad
faith
was
justified.
however,
the
district
court
in
its
opinion,
at
page
174
of
the
appendix,
notes
that
there
had
been
any
erratic,
but
a
continuous
course
of
improvement
and
a
cooperative
attitude
of
state
authorities,
generally
speaking.
so
when
you
read
the
courts
opinion,
you
--
it
is
difficult
to
read
bad
faith
into
it.
mr.
garner
l.
taylor,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
am
not
sure
exactly
what
date
it
started.
this
litigation
begin
in
1969.
mr.
garner
l.
taylor,
jr.
there
has
been
litigation.
this,
this
action
has
--
mr.
garner
l.
taylor,
jr.
your
honor
to
be
honest
with
you
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
courses
of
fbi
investigations
or
whether
there
have
been
any
in
our
prison
system.
mr.
garner
l.
taylor,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
garner
l.
taylor,
jr.
yes
sir.
we
challenge
the
determinations,
but
more
that
your
honor,
we
also
challenge
the
proposition
that
a
court
can
make
an
award
of
attorney's
fees
payable
out
of
the
funds
of
state
agency
which
is
not
even
a
party
to
the
litigation,
based
upon
this
bad
faith
doctrine,
which
is
an
exception
to
the
traditional
american
rule.
but
here,
the
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction
over
the
department
of
correction.
the
department
of
correction
was
not
a
party
and
the
state
of
arkansas
--
mr.
garner
l.
taylor,
jr.
no
sir,
no
sir.
mr.
garner
l.
taylor,
jr.
no
sir,
but
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
the
attorney
general
may
protect
the
interest
of
the
state
under
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity,
regardless
of
whether
it
is
a
party.
mr.
garner
l.
taylor,
jr.
no
sir
that
is
not
my
understanding
of
the
law
under
ford
v.
department
of
treasury,
if
i
am
not
mistaken
here.
mr.
garner
l.
taylor,
jr.
no
sir.
no
sir,
i
believe
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
held
that
the
state
attorney
general
may
protect
the
interest
of
the
state
pursuant
to
the
eleventh
amendment
regardless
of
whether
or
not
the
state
is
a
party
to
the
action.
that
argument
maybe
made
on
the
behalf
of
the
state.
mr.
garner
l.
taylor,
jr.
but
it
is
our
contention
that
the
bad
faith
doctrine
should
not
justify
an
award
of
attorney's
fees
against
the
department
of
correction
in
the
state.
furthermore,
this
act
should
not
be
applied
retroactively
because
to
apply
this
retroactively,
to
apply
the
civil
tight
attorneys
fees
awards
act
of
1976
in
a
retroactive
fashion,
will
work
a
manifest
in
justice.
under
the
decision
of
this
court
in
bradley
v.
school
board
of
the
city
of
richmond,
the
court
noted
that
generally
a
court
will
apply
the
law
in
existence
at
the
time
it
makes
its
decision
unless
to
do
so
will
result
in
a
manifest
in
justice
and
what
could
be
more
unjust
than
to
require
the
state
to
pay
this
award
when
funds
have
been
appropriated,
budgets
have
been
made,
the
state
had
no
notice
or
knowledge
that
this
award
would
be
assessed
against
them.
it
actually
affects
the
heart
of
fiscal
management
of
the
state
of
arkansas.
mr.
garner
l.
taylor,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
garner
l.
taylor,
jr.
your
honor
at
that
time
there
was
no
such
law.
now,
we
have
a
law
that
provides
for
indemnification
when
officials
are
acting
in
good
faith
for
actual
damages.
mr.
garner
l.
taylor,
jr.
no
sir,
to
my
knowledge
there
is
no
practice
that
the
state
would
actually
pay
the
damages
--
mr.

l.
taylor,

attorney's
fees,
right.
mr.
garner
l.
taylor,
jr.
that
is
correct
sir
and
under
the
present
statute,
the
state
indemnifies
the
officials
for
actual
damages.
there
is
no
mention
of
attorney's
fees
in
that
act.
if
this
court
in
newman
v.
piggy
park
enterprises
recognized
that
a
major
purpose
of
providing
for
an
award
of
attorney's
fees
was
to
encourage
litigants
to
bring
suits
vindicate
the
public
interest,
a
very
valid
reason,
but
as
to
pending
cases,
such
an
incentive
is
unnecessary
because
the
case
is
already
in
litigation.
so
it
seems
to
us
that
perspective
application
of
this
act
will
accomplish
this
goal
while
at
the
same
time
enabling
the
states
to
better
prepare
for
the
increased
financial
burden
that
maybe
placed
upon
them
in
the
future.
our
third
point
that
we
want
the
court
to
consider,
is
whether
the
lower
courts
were
correct
in
ruling
that
indefinite
punitive
confinement
is
unconstitutional.
punitive
confinement
is
employed
when
an
inmate
simply
will
not
abide
by
the
rules
of
the
institution
to
recalcitrant
inmate.
they
have
stripped
him
of
other
privileges,
denied
other
benefits
in
minor
disciplinary
proceedings
and
it
is
generally
employed
in
instances
where
there
is
an
escape
or
an
assault
on
someone
or
a
refusal
to
work.
this
point
does
not
concern
the
conditions
of
the
confinement,
but
only
the
duration
of
confinement.
the
district
court
found
that
the
procedures
employed
in
the
disciplinary
proceedings
were
consistent
with
the
decision
of
this
court
in
wolff's
v.
mcdonnell
and
the
court
also
made
specific
ruling
so
that
the
inmates
now
have
no
more
than
two
in
a
cell
at
a
time.
they
have
clothing,
same
diet,
regular
diet
as
the
other
inmates
with
the
exception
of
dessert,
they
do
not
get
any
dessert.
they
have
a
bunk
and
a
mattress.
they
are
entitled
to
a
shower
three
times
a
week,
but
the
district
court
ruled
that
they
could
not
be
held
in
punitive
confinement
for
more
than
30
days
and
it
is
our
contention
that
this
was
erred
on
the
part
of
the
district
court
and
the
eight
circuit
in
placing
a
limit
on
the
amount
of
punitive
confinement.
mr.
garner
l.
taylor,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
garner
l.
taylor,
jr.
no
sir.
the
inmate
holds
the
key
to
his
own
release.
anytime
he
wants
he
wants
to
conform
to
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
institution,
do
what
he
is
supposed
to
do
and
this
is
assuming
that
the
rules
and
regulations
are
constitutional,
the
district
court
found
that,
the
rules
and
regulations
were
constitutional,
but
we
have
a
situation
where
an
inmate
simply
refuses
to
abide
by
the
rules
and
regulations.
mr.
garner
l.
taylor,
jr.
the
court
did
find,
did
hold
that
it
was
unconstitutional
to
hold
men
in
punitive
confinement
indefinitely
and
ruled
that
they
could
not
held
there
for
longer
than
30
days
at
a
time.
at
that
time
they
would
have
to
be
transferred
to
the
maximum
security
--
mr.
garner
l.
taylor,
jr.
the
court
did
not
find
a
constitutional
violation
in
the
conditions
of
confinement,
your
honor,
only
in
the
duration.
the
conditions
of
confinement
meet
constitutional
muster
under
the
course
of
decree
at
this
point.
the
court
ruled
that
indefinite
punitive
confinement
serves
no
rehabilitative
purpose
and
simply
makes
bad
man
worse,
but
that
argument
is
a
phenological
argument.
that
argument
is
directed
towards
the
administration
of
the
penitentiary.
mr.
garner
l.
taylor,
jr.
your
honor,
i
will
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
garner
l.
taylor,
jr.
with
regard
to
the
point
made
concerning
our
state
statute
requiring
the
attorney
general
to
appear,
i
would
refer
the
court
to
ford
motor
company
v.
department
of
treasury,
a
similar
statute
was
involved
in
that
particular
case,
it
is
in
the
footnote
left
of
the
court's
decision
and
in
that
case
it
was
held
that
there
was
no
waiver
by
the
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
attorney
general
appeared
and
defended
the
action.
i
believe
this
court
acknowledged
the
fact
when
it
decided
the
landmark
case
of
fitzpatrick
v.
bitzer,
it
was
breaking
new
ground
that
--
and
setting
forth
the
means
by
which
congress
can
act
pursuant
to
section
5
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
abrogate
a
state's
eleventh
amendment
immunity
without
a
wavier,
express
or
implied
on
part
of
the
state.
the
court
acknowledged
that
it
was
making
new
law
and
we
urge
the
court
to
adopt
the
position
that
when
congress
acts
pursuant
to
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
it
must
do
so
in
explicit
statutory
language
and
urge
the
court
to
do
decide
in
this
case
and
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
