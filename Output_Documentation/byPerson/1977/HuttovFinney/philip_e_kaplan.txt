mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
from
the
beginning
of
my
participation
in
this
case
in
december
of
1969
until
today,
there
have
been
three
published
district
court
opinions,
five
additional
unpublished
interim
memorandum
orders
of
the
district
court
and
three
opinions
in
the
court
of
appeals
regarding
the
arkansas
department
of
corrections
and
the
administration
of
the
arkansas
prison
system.
all
of
the
findings
of
unconstitutionality
of
the
arkansas
prison
system
as
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
by
the
district
court
have
either
been
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
or
never
challenged.
not
one
of
the
district
court's
most
recent
findings,
either
of
fact
or
conclusions
of
law
are
challenged
here.
what
is
challenged
is
one
small
aspect
of
the
remedial
portion
of
the
judge's
order.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
that
is
correct
and
i
think
that
it
is
necessary
for
you
to
have
a
picture
of
what
life
was
like
in
the
punitive
segregation
section
of
maximum
security
in
1975.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
so
that
focus
can
be
directly
related
to
the
judge's
power
to
impose
that
particular
equitable
remedy.
it
is
not
an
isolation.
this
order
--
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
no,
that
here
is
the
order
of
no
more
than
30
days
is
not
an
isolated
remedy.
it
is
in
connection
with
a
whole
(inaudible)
of
remedy
and
orders
that
the
judge
imposed
with
regard
to
the
decision.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
none
of
which
are
challenged.
now,
with
regard
to
that
30
days,
recall
that
the
record
will
demonstrate
that
persons
who
are
kept
in
a
cell
nine-and-half-feet
by
seven
feet
designed
for
one
person,
frequently,
most
of
it
with
three
people
in
the
cell
--
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
it
has
now
been
limited
to
two.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
but
that
is
what
we
had
when
the
judge
decided
it.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
yes,
but
also
the
judge
was
deciding
this
case
in
a
context
of
his
having
written
decisions
since
1968,
before
mr.
holt
and
i
entered
this
case,
limiting
overcrowding,
prohibiting
overcrowding
and
never
once
had
he
found
those
orders
being
complied
with,
never
once
and
in
the
context
of
that
series
of
evasions
of
court
orders
since
1968,
he
finally
says,
no
indeterminate
sentencing
and
only
two
in
a
cell.
one
pallet,
one
steel
pallet
--
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
still
true,
one
steel
pallet,
still
true,
one
steel
pallet
with
mattresses
during
the
day
only.
no
other
furnishings
except
for
a
single
unit,
lavatory
and
commode.
that
is
the
entire
furnishings
of
the
cell.
that
was
true
in
1975
and
remains
true
today.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
not
during
the
day
time.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
at
night
a
person
is
furnished
with
a
mattress
and
a
blanket.
an
atmosphere,
a
pervasive
atmosphere
of
brutality
from
1968
on
and
he
confirms
it
in
1975,
between
guards
and
inmates,
between
inmates
and
inmates,
in
this
terribly
overcrowded
situation,
just
a
pervasive
atmosphere
of
brutality.
no
mail
from
anyone
except
the
court.
no
family
contact.
no
contact
with
anyone
else.
no
visits
from
anyone
except
the
occasional
visit,
perhaps,
from
a
minister.
no
books.
no
law
books,
the
only
book
permitted,
the
bible,
that
is
it,
but
no
law
books,
unless
he
has
been
in
there
for
in
excess
of
20
days.
no
exercise
with
the
exception
of
every
third
day
to
the
shower.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
all
of
this
is
clearly
admitted
and
i
am
challenged,
but
the
basis
for
the
judge's
order
of
no
indeterminate
sentencing
and
it
is
within
that
context
that
the
order
arises.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
he
found
that
the
entire
conditions
including
the
indefinite
sentencing,
violated
the
crew
in
unusual
section.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
that
is
substantive
determination,
one
aspect
of
the
remedy
meets
that
directly.
it
is
within
this
context,
that
the
judge
says
no
indefinite
sentencing
and
the
state
challenges
nothing
else.
he
relates
the
remedy
exactly
to
the
violation.
he
does
not
go
beyond
it.
he
does
not
go
outside
of
it.
he
just
says
i
am
relating
it
to
the
remedy
as
part
of
an
overall
remedy.
i
eliminate
grove
and
i
eliminate
more
than
two
people.
i
require
an
appealing
diet.
i
say
no
more
brutality
again
for
the
fourth
or
fifth
time
and
one
of
the
other
things
is
no
more
indeterminate
sentencing
and
that
does
help,
with
the
disease
and
communicable
health
problems
that
he
finds
in
the
other
sections
of
the
prison,
it
does
help
with
the
overcrowding.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
only
for
the
cruel
and
unusual
aspect.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
very
well
your
honor.
with
regard
to
the
attorney's
fees
issue.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
no.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
i
think
the
record
is
quite
clear
that
the
only
way
one
can
be
sentenced
to
punitive
segregation
is
for
a
violation
of
a
prison
rule
after
a
due
process
hearing.
and
it
has
a
specific
relation.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
i
disagree
with
the
issue
that
a
person
holds
the
key.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
i
disagree
with
the
matter
of
fact.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
that
is
correct.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
he
did
not.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
they
did
not.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
well
--
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
there
is
in
the
sense
that,
mr.
justice
stewart
phrased
the
question,
there
is
no
real
justice
of
--
and
no
real
dispute
of
fact
because
the
court
below
may
--
did
make
certain
findings
with
regard
to
actual
sentencing
to
punitive
isolation.
yet,
the
rules
of
the
administration
themselves
say,
there
shall
be
no
indefinite
sentences.
they
say
that
and
they
are
quite
clear.
there
shall
be
none.
sentences
were
always
imposed
and
the
record
show
that
from
1970
on,
when
there
were
written
rules,
sentences
were
always
from
0
to
30
days
or
1
to
30
days,
that
is
all
there
ever
was.
there
has
never
been
--
you
are
sentenced
until
you
decide
to
go
to
work,
that
has
never
been
the
situation.
there
was
never
a
need
for
a
finding
because
then
factual
setting
never
arose.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
well,
there
is
because
the
judge
also
found
that
inmates
such
as
alfanso
graham
were
there
for
six
months
on
a
limited
diet,
in
exactly
this
situation
that
i
attempted
to
describe.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
now,
it
will
not
be.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
many
of
the
physical
--
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
it
does
not
involve
the
same,
but
what
the
judge
described
was
a
situation
of
evolving
and
changing
horrors.
this
is
the
same
judge
who
found
horrible
situations
in
jackson
v.
bishop
with
the
strap
and
with
a
tucker
telephone
and
here
he
finds
himself
8
years
later
within
a
evolving
kind
of
brutality,
but
the
same,
just
in
the
same
direct
tradition.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
he
has
always
ordered
it
to
be
corrected.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
he
has
never
been
met
with
compliance
--
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
he
has
not
questioned
any
of
those
orders.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
that
is
correct.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
it
is
not
to
be
reached
here,
but
it
is
our
position
that,
that
would
be
true.
that
is
--
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
i
am
saying
that
the
--
that
they
are
seeking
to
impose
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
is
not
an
issue,
i
am
sorry,
indefinite
sentencing
is
not
an
issue.
their
rules
suggest
that
they
could
not
and
they
are
not
suggesting
that
they
are
now
attempting
to
change
the
rule.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
well,
what
was
happening
was
that
the
institution
was
keeping
people
and
forgetting
them.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
you
may
not
do
it
under
any
circumstances.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
i
am
sorry
your
honor,
i
did
not
hear
you.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
it
has
always
been
the
rule.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
but
you
could
not
keep
them
over
thirty
days.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
i
have
no
idea,
why
the
state
has
made
that
appeal
we
move
to
dismiss
this
improvidently
granted
on
exactly
that
basis.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
yes
your
honor.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
oh
no.
just
that
there
has
been
an
evolving
kind
of
evasion
of
the
same
kinds
of
brutality.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
it
is
gone
as
is
the
strap.
with
regard
to
the
award
of
counsel
fees
we
advance
--
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
because
the
state
does
not
say
that
there
never
have
been
any,
that
is
their
rule,
they
have
actually
confined
people
and
the
record
here
does
show
that
they
have
confined
people
for
five
and
six
months.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
it
was
a
question
from
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
believe.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
i
do
not
your
honor.[laughter]
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
alright,
i
think
i
can
address
that
and
i
have
three
specific
items
that
i
want
to
refer
to,
to
address
that
question
particularly.
one,
the
judge
did
make
a
finding
with
regard
to
punitive
segregation.
it
appears
at
410
f's
up
275,
the
specific
finding
his
brief.
it
says
while
most
inmates
sentenced
to
punitive
isolation
are
released
to
population
within
less
than
14
days,
many
remain
in
the
status
in
question
for
weeks
or
months
depending
upon
their
attitudes
as
appraised
by
prison
personnel.
so
it
is
not
the
key
that
is
in
their
hand.
it
is
in
someone
else's
hand
that
the
judge
has
said
is
already
poorly
trained,
response
poorly,
response
inadequately
and
excessively.
the
record
amply
supports
it.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
well,
the
judge
has
responded
to
that
exactly.
he
said
no
more
than
30
days
deals
with
that
whole
issue
and
then
he
clarifies
it
and
says
if
there
is
another
rule
violation,
they
maybe
tried
again
for
a
separate
rule
violation
and
placed
in
punitive
segregation
again
under
the
rules
for
that
separate
violation.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
well
there
are
two
things.
he
does
also
ask
for
a
periodic
re-examination,
but
then
says
if
there
is
another
serious
violation,
they
be
tried
again
under
all
of
the
other
procedures
and
safeguards
and
rules
that
the
prison
has
had.
now,
that
is
the
way
the
judge
has
dealt
with
it.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
that
is
correct.
their
rule
says
and
the
rule
is
quoted
at
--
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
in
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
that
he
finds,
he
does
say
that
under
the
constitution
he
finds
that
in
the
totality
here,
in
this
case,
in
1975,
the
way
i
find
the
conditions,
not
the
way
we
look
at
them
two
years
later
and
see
that
some
of
them
have
been
ameliorated
by
some
other
conditions
or
some
of
his
remedy,
but
as
i
find
them
here
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
i
find
that
more
than
30
days
is
cruel
and
unusual.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
on
the
fear
that
someone
of
them
might
not,
but
also
in
recognition
of
seven
or
eight
years
of
history
of
dealing
with
the
same
people
under
circumstances
where
there
was
no
carrying
out
of
a
remedy
and
i
think
that
you
cannot
take
one
little
part
and
say
if
the
30
days
had
been
the
only
thing,
the
30
days
would
have
been
appropriate.
it
would
have
relieved
over
crowding.
it
would
have
stopped
inadequate
or
unappealing
diet
for
a
whole
long
period
of
time.
it
would
have
reached
a
number
of
these
items.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
i
think
perhaps
he
could
have.
he
was,
he
had
before
him
however
a
mountain
of
evidence
of
persons
who
have
languished
in
punitive
isolation.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
the
enforcement
of
the
rules
would
have
taken
care
of
it,
if
they
would
have
enforced
their
own
rule,
but
the
rule
was
always
observed
in
the
breach
as
opposed
to
in
the
observants
of
the
rule
itself
in
particular
to
the
rule.
it
was
never
adhere
to,
it
was
breached.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
yes.
your
honor
it
is
at
page
24.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
of
the
brief,
of
our
brief,
the
rule
which
is
taken
directly
from
their
disciplinary
procedures
is
quoted
and
it
is
in
footnote
11
and
at
the
bottom
of
page
24
is
the
statement
about
15
days
in
punitive
segregation
not
being
for
indefinite
or
permanent.
there,
it
continues
in
the
footnote
section
of
page
25.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
that
is
correct.
it
is
no
longer
restricted,
but
again
this
was
only
one
means
of
dealing
with
it.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
well,
what
the
evidence
shows
is
that
mr.
lockhart
and
mr.
hutto,
both
the
commissioner
and
the
warden
said
that
14
days
was
the
ordinary
situation
and
almost
all
inmates
were
released
in
14
days.
the
testimony
also
show
that
there
was
an
inmate
there
for
over
six
months,
that
the
warden
never
knew
about
until
he
heard
about
it
in
testimony
in
court,
so
that
perhaps
--
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
the
only
exception
is
the
next
paragraph.
it
says
where
recalcitrant
inmates
are
to
be
returned
to
ordinary
diet.
that
is
the
only
exception
that
we
know
about
and
that
is
the
attitudinal
problem
that
the
judge
was
dealing
with.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
well,
the
facts
show
and
that
is
what
i
stated
before,
the
facts
show
that
there
never
had
been
a
sentence
for
more
than
30
days.
that
the
only
time
that
there
was
more
than
30
days
was
this
recalcitrant
attitudinal
problem
that
the
judge
specifically
addresses.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
that
is
correct.
i
would
like
to
pass
on
to
the
attorney's
fees
issue.
with
regard
to
the
award
of
counsel
fees,
we
advance
two
separate
and
independent
arguments.
first,
we
maintain
as
justice
stevens
has
already
urged
in
fitzpatrick
that
awards
--
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
there
has
never
been
a
petition
to
modify
or
to
be
relieved
from
the
provisions
of
the
award,
of
that
particular
injunctive
item.
we
have
had
in
january
of
1978,
15
more
days
of
hearings
and
still
have
not
rested
and
there
has
not
been
yet
a
motion
to
be
relieved
from
the
provisions
of
this
award.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
that
is
correct,
there
has
been
no
such
motion.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
the
first
again
that
counsel
fees
are
not
subject
to
the
limitations
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
if
this
contention
is
accepted
by
the
court
it
is
dispositive
of
the
award
of
counsel
fees
since
the
court's
award
of
counsel
fees
by
--
on
a
basis
of
bad
faith
is
expressly
authorized
in
alyeska
and
since
it
is
not
an
unusual
item
to
assess
fees
under
the
suffront
(ph)
doctrine
against
the
party.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
no,
i
do
not
think
so.
i
think
that,
that
is
the
clearly
the
situation
contemplated
in
suffront
that
one
who

arkansas
statute
compels
the
attorney
general
here
to
represent
the
interests
of
the
state,
that
is
not
the
indemnity
statute.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
the
state
was
not
a
named
party
and
could
not
--
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
the
state
was
a
party
by
virtue
in
our
view
of
having
been
there.
the
attorney
general
has
represented
the
state
in
connection
with
this
pursuant
to
state
law,
the
attorney
general
shall
maintain
and
defend
interests
of
the
state
in
matters
before
the
federal
courts
and
shall
be
the
representative
of
all
state
officers,
boards
and
commissioners
in
all
litigation
where
the
interests
of
the
state
are
involved
and
i
do
not
think
that
anyone
disputes
that,
that
is
exactly
the
situation
that
has
occurred
in
this
case.
since
the
onset
of
the
litigation
in
1965
that
is,
that
the
attorney
general
has
been
present,
representing
the
interests
of
the
state
and
indeed
pursuant
to
the
same
statute,
the
state
has
paid
the
assessments
of
costs,
both
their
attorney's
fee's
cost,
other
expenses
of
the
case,
including
the
law
students
that
we
hired
over
a
period
of
years,
including
the
transcripts
for
the
proceedings
before
the
magistrate,
sitting
as
the
special
master
to
hear
the
evidence,
all
of
those
have
been
paid
as
cost
by
warrant
on
the
state
treasury,
pursuant
to
this
statute.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
it
is
in
the
record
of
the
court
below
when
they
satisfy
the
judgments,
they
satisfy
them
based
on
their
drawing
of
a
warrant
on
the
treasury
to
us
and
we
received
all
of
those
and
checks
in
the
course
of
the
history
of
this
litigation,
drawn
on
the
auditor
of
the
state
of
arkansas.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
that
is
correct.
the
$8,000
awarded
for
the
district
court
proceedings
in
1973.
these
fees
to
three
lawyers
for
two-and-a-half
year's
work
on
this
case
that
is
everything
from
the
appeal
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
what
is
finney
one,
that
amounted
to
the
$20,000.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
no
place
except
that
all
of
the
documents
have
been
signed
by
the
attorney
general
representing
everybody
pursuant
to
the
statute.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
there
is
none.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
there
is
none.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
we
get
jurisdiction
pursuant
to
1983
and
pursuant
to
the
fact
that
we
have
all
of
the
board.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
no
we
are
talking
now
about
--
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
well
--
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
nothing
is
in
here
that
says
the
state
of
arkansas
is
here.
there
are
as
it
turns
out,
two
cases
that
were
consolidated
in
1975
in
which
that
the
department
of
corrections
is
a
named
party.
no
one
ever
challenged
the
fact
that
they
were
named
in
those
two
cases.
in
1975,
judge
henley
consolidated
approximately
70,
1983
petitions
for
hearing
on
the
merits
of
those
cases,
at
the
same
time
as
we
heard
finney
remand
from
the
circuit
court.
two
of
those
cases,
one
of
which
is
pittman
v.
others
and
the
department
of
corrections
names
the
departments
of
corrections
as
a
state
body.
now,
that
is
the
only
thing
in
the
record
which
indicates
that
the
state
is
a
party.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
that
is
in
this
case.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
oh
yes.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
well
it
is
in
the,it
is
in
the
docket
entries
of
the
district
court.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
well,
that
is
the
actual
pleading.
the
pleadings
were
all
consolidated
with
this
case
and
the
judge
issued
his
ruling
--
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
well
the
pleading
itself
is
in
the
record.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
that
says
that
state
of
arkansas
is
a
named
party
was
not
moved
out
of
the
case,
was
not
plead
out
of
the
case
in
anyway.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
that
is
in
pittman
against
others
and
department
of
correction.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
that
case
is
consolidated
with
this
case
by
an
order
of
consolidation.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
it
is
up
here
as
a
consolidated
matter,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
the
record
has
been
forwarded
from
the
district
court,
the
entire
record.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
in
that
case
in
response
to
mr.
justice
marshall's
question,
yes.
mr.
philip
e.
kaplan
the
named
party
was
the
arkansas
department
of
corrections
in
the
case
that
i
referred
to
justice
marshall
and
the
second
ground
is
that
the
award
of
counsel
fees
is
authorized
by
the
civil
rights
attorney's
fees
act
of
1976
which
was
adopted
in
response
to
alyeska
under
fitzpatrick
and
under
the
--
with
a
proper
congressional
exercise
of
power,
not
with
the
magic
words
amending,
to
say
that
we
can
say
a
named,
that
state
may
be
sued,
but
the
legislative
history
is
quite
clear,
quite
explicit
that
the
congress
intended
that
states
pay
these
fees.
the
senate
report
is
cited
at
page
78
of
our
brief
as
is
the
house
report.
both
of
which
are
quite
clear
that
these
fees
assessed
against
officials
are
to
be
collected
from
the
state.
and
representative
(inaudible)
report
makes
it
clear
or
his
statements
make
it
clear,
quoted
at
page
81
of
the
brief,
that
it
is
an
enactment
pursuant
to
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
there
is
no
doubt
what
the
legislative
history
in
this
case
provides
and
that
is
that
the
states
are
to
pay
these
awards.
that
$20,000
that
the
state
says
will
be
such
a
catastrophic
on
it,
was
assessed
for
three
lawyer
for
two-and-half
to
three
year's
work
in
one
billion
dollar
budget
and
it
is
clearly
ancillary
if
anything
is
ancillary,
the
state
paid
over
$500,000
to
build
the
east
building
in
response
to
what
the
judge
required
and
here
we
are
not
dealing
with
a
catastrophic
award,
a
fees
is
so
going
to
seriously
dehabilitate
the
state
ability
to
function
in
that
year
or
in
any
other
year.
thank
you.
