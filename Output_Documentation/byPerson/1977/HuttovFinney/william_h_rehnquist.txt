justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly,
some
of
our
cases
have
gone
sufficiently
as
far
as
so
as
say
that
you
look
at
everything
you
can
in
construing
the
statute,
rather
than
the
more
traditional
role,
perhaps
a
while
ago
that
only
where
the
legislative
language
is
unclear,
do
you
resort
to
the
history.
i
mean
--
it
seems
to
me
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history,
the
committee
report
in
this
case,
it
seems
that
the
officer's
committee
report
pretty
clearly
thought
that
they
were
going
to
impose
attorney's
fees
against
governmental
bodies,
do
not
you
think
so?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
your
point
that,
even
if
congress
had
enacted
the
language
that
you
find
in
the
committee
reports,
it
would
have
been
insufficient
or
that
the
committee
reports
are
not
sufficiently
weighty
so
as
to
affect
the
language
that
congress
did
choose
to
enact?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
makes
it
a
relatively
easy
case
for
both
of
you
to
focus
on
it,
does
not
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
none
of
which
are
challenged
by
your
opponent?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
also
you
suggested
it
is
a
part
of
the
equitable
remedy
or
the
judge's
holding
was
that
this
particular
form
of
punitive
segregation,
violated
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishments
clause,
did
he
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that
is
a
substantiative
determination,
not
is
just
a
formulation
of
an
equitable
remedy?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
kaplan
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question.
if
the
state
says
that
there
have
never
been
punitive
confinements
in
excess
of
30
days
and
you
say
you
do
not
disagree
with
that,
why
on
earth
did
the
judge
make
a
ruling
on
that
point?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then
it
is
an
issue?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
am
not
sure
i
remember
and
perhaps
you
do
not
either.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
was
something
in
the
nature
of
if
in
fact
people
are
not
confined
more
than
30
days,
why
did
the
district
court
make
a
finding
on
the
--
that
it
would
be
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
for
them
to
be
confined
more
than
30
days?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
do
with
justice
stevens'
inquiry
about
the
second
sentence
of
the
rule
i
at
the
bottom
of
page
24
versus
ordinarily
no
inmates
should
be
remain
in
punishment
as
segregation
or
on
unrestricted
diet
than
more
than
15
days?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
you
could
not
say
was
a
violation
of
this
particular
rule,
if
the
prison
board
found
extraordinary
circumstances
to
sentence
them
for
than
30
days,
could
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
said
a
minute
ago
the
department
of
corrections
than
i
think
perhaps
you
said
at
another
time
the
state
of
arkansas,
are
you
using
them
interchangeably?
