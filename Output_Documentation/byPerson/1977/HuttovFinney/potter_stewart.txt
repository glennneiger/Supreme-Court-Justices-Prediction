if
the
dependents
had
been
assessed
these
attorney's
fees,
would
they
as
matter
of
arkansas
law
been
reimbursed
by
the
state?
justice
potter
stewart
but
at
the
time
there
was
no
law
--
you
have
any
reason
to
it
--
suppose
it
--
despite
the
absence
of
a
law
they
would
or
would
not
have
been
reimbursed
by
the
state,
was
there
any?
practice
justice
potter
stewart
attorney's
fees?
justice
potter
stewart
well
now
why,
if
the
issue
is
as
narrow
as
you
just
told
us
it
is?
justice
potter
stewart
you
just
told
us
it
is?
justice
potter
stewart
no
mattress,
no
blanket,
no
nothing?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
at
night?
justice
potter
stewart
before
you
leave
that
point,
do
you
agree
that
this
so
called
indefinite
or
indeterminate
sentencing,
isolation
is
in
fact
sort
of
akin
to
civil
commitment,
i.e.
that
the
inmate
has
the
keys
in
his
own
pocket,
if
he
agrees
to
abide
by
the
rules
and
has
he
abide
by
the
rules?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
a
disagreement
of
fact,
which
we
--
it
is
very
unfortunate
if
we
have
that
here
in
this
court
because
generally
we
are
not
triers
of
the
facts?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
does
not
solve
the
question.
so
it
is
there
because
of
violation
of
a
prison
rule
after
due
process
hearing.
now,
your
brother
on
the
other
side
says
he
can
get
out
of
there
anytime
he
says,
i
will
hereafter
abide
by
the
rule
and
then
proceed
to
do
so.
now,
do
you
disagree
with
that
as
a
matter
of
fact?
if
so
may
we
better
remand
this
case
to
have
the
facts
determined,
we
are
not
affect
determining
body?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
not
a
matter
of
a
agreement
or
disagreement
really,
it
is
(voice
overlap)
agree
or
disagree
about
an
idea
or
an
opinion,
this
is
a
matter
of
fact?
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
he
his
factually
mistakenly
when
told
us
that?
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
going
to
be
a
limited
diet
now?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
therefore
we
have
to
know,
is
it
not
true
that
many
of
these
horribles
that
you
have
paraded
in
front
of
us
have
now
been
ordered
to
be
corrected?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
the
punitive
segregation
does
not
involve
the
same
conditions
that
you
described
to
us?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
has
he
not
ordered
it
to
be
corrected?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
has
not
been
--
justice
potter
stewart
we
do
not
have
that
before
us,
the
--
at
least
for
the
purposes
of
present
case,
the
--
your
brother
is
not
questioning
those
orders.
is
that
not
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
is
only
this
slight
little
slaver
that
you
describe
to
us
at
the
opening
of
your
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
assumes
that
it
is
going
to
be
a
restricted
diet
and
the
diet
is
no
longer
restricted
except
the
absence
of
dessert?
justice
potter
stewart
the
who
is
then
â€“
which
was
the
named
party?
