justice
john
paul
stevens
general
taylor
let
me
ask
one
question
about
the
procedure.
it
is
your
view
that
the
it
was
wrong
to
order
the
fees
payed
by
the
department
of
correction's
funds,
would
you
concede
that
the
court
had
power
order
your
clients,
the
individual
defendants
to
pay
the
fee?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
the
act
applies,
if
the
act
applies,
your
arguments
about
the
state
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
argument
strikes
me
as
is,
the
department
of
correction
is
not
the
party
to
the
case,
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so
how
are
your
clients
hurt
by
the
order
for
the
department
of
correction
to
pay
the
fees,
the
individual
litigants
here?
are
they
not
really
helped
by
having
the
judge
order
that
the
department
pay
the
fees
instead
of
having
them
individually
pay
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
except
that
you
put
bail
and
went
back
to
the
trial
judge,
he
may
say,
well,
i
think
that
the
individual
better
pay
the
fee,
is
not
that
a
possible
consequence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
you
prevail
and
it
is
sent
back
to
the
trial
judge,
so
you
cannot
order
to
be
paid
by
them
and
a
different
order
is
an
entirely
possible,
he
will
say
well
the
individual
defendants
have
to
pay
this
fee?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
the
department
of
corrections
intervene
to
object
to
that
order?
it
did
not,
did
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
just
wondering
whether
you
are
really
advancing
the
best
interest
of
your
clients
in
your
arguments
here.
the
litigants
who
are
actually
effected
--
i
mean,
the
individual
defendants?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
if
the
statute
applies
would
he
have,
would
the
judge
have
power
to
order
the
fees
paid
by
the
individual
defendants?
if
the
statute
applies
that
we
agree
with
you
that
it
cannot
be
applied
against
the
state?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
could
the
judge
order
the
individuals
to
pay
the
fees?
justice
john
paul
stevens
whether
manifest
necessity
determination
i
suppose
would
take
into
account
the
finding
of
bad
faith,
would
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
(voice
overlap)
that
two
courts
have
agreed
on
that,
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
john
paul
stevens
counsel,
did
the
district
judge
make
any
finding
of
fact
on
the
question
of
how
an
inmate
terminates
his
independence,
his
indeterminate
sentence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
either
side
ask
him
to
make
a
finding
of
fact
on
that
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
i
suppose
the
question
is
who
had
the
burden
of
establishing
this
fact,
is
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
there
is
a
factual
dispute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
there
is
no
need
for
this
relief,
if
that
is
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr,
kaplan,
do
you
take
the
position,
i
am
just
quite
not
sure
what
your
position
is,
if
the
prison
officials
comply
with
the
judge's
order
with
respect
to
the
conditions
of
containment,
but
they
then
seek
to
impose
indefinite
sentences,
would
that
be
cruel
and
unusual
punishment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
is
it
not
to
be
reached
here
because
you
say
there
was
a
more
of
a
violation
in
the
past
which
has
now
been
corrected?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just
really
do
not
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
it
is
hopefully
the
last
chapter
in
a
protected
piece
of
litigation,
involving
present
conditions
in
the
arkansas
penal
system.
three
questions
are
presented
in
this
case.
the
first
is
whether
it
was
permissible
for
the
trial
judge
as
a
part
of
the
comprehensive
relief
he
granted
to
for
the
benefit
of
the
prisoners
who
challenged
the
conditions
in
that
system
to
include
a
requirement
that
sentences
to
punitive
solitary
isolation
not
exceed
30
days.
the
court
holds
that
this
was
within
the
trial
judge's
discretion.
on
this
part
of
the
case,
eight
members
of
the
court
agree,
there
is
a
dissenting
opinion
on
this
point
filed
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
the
second
question
presented
was
whether
it
was
appropriate
for
the
trial
judge
to
allow
an
attorneyâ€™s
fee
of
$20,000
to
counsel
for
the
plaintiffs
for
services
in
the
trial
court
to
be
paid
out
of
the
funds
of
the
department
of
corrections.
the
court
holds
on
this
issue
that
since
there
was
a
finding
of
bad
faith
in
the
failure
of
the
correction
officials
to
abide
by
prior
decrees
and
make
corrections
as
promptly
as
the
court
had
indicated
they
should
be
made
that
the
fee
award
is
justified
and
is
not
prohibited
by
the
eleventh
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution.
on
this
issue,
seven
members
of
the
court
are
in
agreement.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
is
joined
by
justice
white
in
dissenting
on
this
point.
the
third
issue
is
whether
it
was
appropriate
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
add
a
further
fee
award
of
$2500
for
services
to
counsel
on
appeal.
this
award
was
made
after
congress
had
passed
a
statute,
providing
for
the
award
of
fees
in
cases
of
this
kind
and
the
question
that
was
presented
by
the
statute
is
whether
it
applies
to
litigation
where
the
fee
will
be
paid
by
the
state
even
though
the
award,
even
though
the
parties
to
the
litigation
are
persons
sued
in
their
official
capacities.
on
this
issue
the
court
also
sustains
the
award,
but
the
court
is
more
closely
divided.
it
is
five
to
four
on
this
issue.
mr.
justice
powell
has
written
a
dissenting
opinion
on
this
question
in
which
he
has
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
also
again
justice
white
and
justice
rehnquist
dissent
on
this
issue,
so
that
net
result
of
the
case
is
that
the
entire
judgment
is
affirmed.
