where
is
the
rule
in
the
record
you
try
to
tell
us?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
kaplan
that
says
ordinarily
you
should
not
be
retained
for
more
more
15
days
and
at
page
25
it
says
the
regular
punitive
segregation,
either
--
do
the
rules
contemplate
extraordinary
punitive?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
may
have
just
ask
you
a
very
narrow
question,
i
do
not
read
the
rule
as
confining
the
period
of
punitive
segregation
to
15
days?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
just
want
to
go
back
to
this
morning,
has
the
judge
as
the
district
court
determine
in
the
light
of
the
present
conditions
in
the
prison
whether
the
30
day
limit
should
be
retained?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
grounds
that
conditions
have
so
changed
that
the
basis
for
the
order
has
disappeared?
justice
byron
r.
white
thank
you.
