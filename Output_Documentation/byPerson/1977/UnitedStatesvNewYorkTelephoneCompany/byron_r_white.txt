justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
agree
that
the
--
that
the
--
that
an
official
pen
register
must
have
court
consent
and
approval?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
you
do
not
--
you
do
not
say
that
--
you
do
not
say
that
without
any
--
any
official
approval
at
all,
the
fbi
could
install
a
pen
register,
you
need
a
warrant?
justice
byron
r.
white
okay.
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
court
of
appeals
agree
with
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
covered
by
title
iii
and
you
disagree
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
you
entitled
to
urge
that
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
is
much
narrower
than
that.
it
--
it
said
that
the
title
iii
does
not
cover
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
you
wanted
to
challenge
that,
you
really
should
have
cross-petitioned
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
government
does
not
mind
this
either?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
court
of
appeals
also
thought
that
rule
41
authorized
issued
some
warrants
for
pen
register,
did
not
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
disagree
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
are
urging
us
to
overturn
the
court
of
appeals
in
that
regard?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
no
one
has
challenged
that
rule
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
nobody
has
presented
that
issue
to
us
in
any
of
the
papers
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
we
agreed
with
you
--
you
would
--
you
would
be
enlarging
the
relief
of
that
the
court
of
appeals
--
the
court
of
appeals
gave
you?
we
will
be
giving
you
relief
that
the
court
of
appeals
never
gave
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
the
ninth
circuit
said
that
they
--
that
absent
title
iii,
that
they
would
have
reach
the
result,
they
did?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
the
ninth
circuit
(voice
overlap)
had
acted
if
--
with
respect
to
a
pen
register,
absent
title
iii,
you
do
not
know
whether
they
would
have
analogized
it
to
a
possee
comitatus
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand,
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
found
the
title
iii
impliedly
for
bad,
i
should
think?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
did
not
go
any
further
than
this,
so
we
will
stop
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
case
concerns
a
device
called
a
pen
register
which
is
a
mechanical
contrivance
used
by
telephone
companies
to
record
the
numbers
that
are
dialed
on
a
particular
telephone.
law
enforcement
officers,
when
they
have
probable
cause
to
believe
a
phone
is
being
used
in
connection
with
a
crime,
would
also
like
to
use
a
pen
register.
this
case
involves
the
questions
whether
a
district
court
has
the
power
to
authorize
the
installation
of
a
pen
register
on
a
application
of
investigative
officers,
and
also
whether
if
the
court
does
have
such
power,
it
may
order
the
telephone
company
to
furnish
such
aid
is
necessary
for
the
installation
of
the
device.
the
district
court
held
at
the,
that
it
had
such
powers.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
that
the
district
court
can
authorize
the
installation
but
could
not
issue
the
order
against
the
telephone
company.
we
granted
the
petition
for
certiorari
and
we
agree
with
the
district
court
with
the
reasons
which
we
stated
in
an
opinion
on
file
with
the
clerk.
we
hold
that
the
district
court
has
the
authority
to
authorize
the
installation
of
the
pen
register
under
rule
41
of
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure
which
authorizes
issuance
of
warrants
and
under
the
all
writs
act,
we
also
hold
that
the
district
court
has
the
power
to
issue
the
order
that
it
did
against
the
telephone
company.
so
we
reverse
the
court
appeals
in
that
respect.
