me
that
in
new
york
city,
they

on
every
phone
in
new
york
city?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
mean,
what
is
the
percentage
number?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
would
be
very
small
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
is
quite
a
few
phones
in
new
york
city?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
wallace,
we
do
not
have
to
get
into
the
point
of
the
right
the
fbi
to
walk
into
a
business
establishment
to
tap
a
phone,
do
we?
do
we
have
to
get
to
that
point
to
decide
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
ashley,
does
this
record
show
that
you
use
pen
registers
yourself?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
means
that
are
you
not
listening
all
conversations?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh!
yes
you
do
when
there
is
fraud
involved
or
you
suspect
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no
i
what
mean
is
it
is
not
just
the
clear
and
unclear.
you
do
violate
the
rights
of
privacy
of
people.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
they
do
listen
in?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
you
do
it
to
prevent
violence
law
--
violation
law?
now,
what
is
this
pen
register
that
the
government
wants?
justice
thurgood
marshall
to
prevent
violation
of
the
law?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
you
get
authority
to
put
you
up
pen
registers
only?
except
that
if
you
do
not
assume
authority
as
a
public
utility,
you
are
just
a
private
citizen.
well,
private
citizens,
i
have
trouble
finding
authority
to
put
a
pen
register?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
also
to
listen
in?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
one
or
two
words
in
41
would
give
the
gov
(inaudible)?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
ashley,
what
worries
me
is
it
that
fbi
comes
and
says,
“do
you
have
a
pen
register
on
phone
number
333-6589”
and
you
say,
“yes”
and
they
subpoena
it,
you
deliver,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
issue
a
grand
jury
subpoena,
you
will
deliver?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
you
said
if
you
were
subpoenaed,
you
would
deliver
anything
that
they
ask
for?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
would
not
deliver
a
pen
register?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
is
the
grand
jury
i
asked
for?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
would
not
include
the
pen
register?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
the
pen
--
if
the
pen
register
was
transcribed
on
the
--
on
your
records,
you
would
produce
it.
if
it
was
not
on
your
records,
you
would
not
produce
it
and
then
i
will
like
you
hear
to
you
explain
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
not
talking
about
title
iii?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
put
a
pen
register
on
a
man’s
phone
and
you
bill
them
pursuant
to
the
pen
register,
you
would
produce
the
bill
upon
subpoena?
justice
thurgood
marshall
upon
the
subpoena,
but
you
would
not
produce
the
pen
register?
