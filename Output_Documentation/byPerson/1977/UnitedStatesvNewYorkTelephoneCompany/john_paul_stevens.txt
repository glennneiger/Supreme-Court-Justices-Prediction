mr.
wallace
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
not
sure
i
follow
that.
if
these
were
records
which
were
available
which
you
assumed
in
your
colloquy
with
justice
stewart,
why
could
not
the
fbi
just
go
and
asked
the
telephone
company
to
see
what
they
had?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
to
the
extent
if
they
are
available
--
now,
why
could
not
the
fbi
just
go
and
say
what
have
you
got
in
the
nature
of
pen
register
records,
maybe
just
long
distance
calls
from
this
number,
is
there
anything
--?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
why
did
they
need
a
warrant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
say
that,
but
what
required
the
warrant?
what
--
what
legal
rule
required
them
to
get
a
warrant,
to
get
additional
numbers
beyond
those
that
were
already
recorded
by
the
telephone
company?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand,
the
practical
reason
why
they
wanted
them,
but
why
could
not
they
just
do
it
independently,
assume
they
had
the
technical
know
how.
justice
john
paul
stevens
(voice
overlap)mr.
wallace
you
do
not
--
you
do
not
contend
that
rule
57
(b)
is
a
grant
of
jurisdiction,
do
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
the
question
again.
do
you
--
do
you
or
do
you
not
contend
that
rule
57
is
an
independent
grant
of
jurisdiction
to
a
federal
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just
wondered,
have
you
had
any
experience
with
a
law
enforcement
agency
wanting
to
get
from
you
the
results
of
a
pen
register
surveillance
that
the
company
has
conducted
for
its
own
purposes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
is
the
companyâ€™s
practice
then,
to
require
a
subpoena
or
what?
justice
john
paul
stevens
without
official
process
anyway,
i
suppose
a
grand
jury
could
subpoena
them
in
your
hand?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
ashley,
before
you
leave
the
point,
do
i
correctly
understand
that
in
addition
to
arguing
the
title
iii
makes
the
underlying
order
invalid
that
there
was
no
authority
for
the
court
order
the
pen
register,
you
also
argued
in
the
alternative
that
the
underlying
order
is
invalid
because
it
is
not
authorized
by
rule
41
or
any
other
federal
(voice
overlap)
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
your
position
is
that
not
only
is
this
particular
order
unauthorized
by
title
iii
or
rule
41,
but
under
neither,
may
the
law
enforcement
agencies
get
a
warrant
for
a
pen
register?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
not
elsewhere?
