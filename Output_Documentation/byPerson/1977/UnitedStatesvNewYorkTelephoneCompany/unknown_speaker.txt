how
is
it
done?
unknown
speaker
a
pen
register
i
gather
is
just
a
recording
device,

and

and
does
the

an
inventory
of

what
they
do?

but
would
the
order
that
--
the
relief
you

to
prevail
on
these,
assuming
we
could
entertain
your
arguments
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
wrong
in
both
respects
--
unknown
speaker
if
we
did,
would
that
support
the
order
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
--
unknown
speaker
or
give
you
a
broader
order
--
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
relief
you
got
below?
unknown
speaker
and
would
you
--
would
you
be
entitled
to
the
order
you
got
below,
had
you
prevailed
on
your
argument
that
the
safe
streets
act
(voice
overlap)
unknown
speaker
even
though
you
didnâ€™t
cross-petition
and
are
you
not
in
the
position
to
urge
these
questions
on
us?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
--
the
ordinary
rule
is;
that
you
are
entitled
here
to
defend
the
order
below
on
whatever
ground
is
available?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
can
do
that
without
expanding
your
relief,
can
you
not?
unknown
speaker
alright.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
ashley
i
do
not
know
that
i
fully
understand
how
much
use
new
york
telephone
company
makes
of
pen
registers
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business?
unknown
speaker
well
what
you
are
telling
me
then
i
gather
is
that,
is
the
exception?
unknown
speaker
not
the
ordinary
course
--
unknown
speaker
mr.
ashley,
go
ahead,
i
am
sorry.
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
if
title
iii
does
not
reach
you
and
the
rule
does
not
reach
you,
then
they
ought
not
be
permitted
without
additional
legislation
which
does
authorizes
them?
unknown
speaker
if
you
were
wrong
about
that?
unknown
speaker
and
until
there
is
such
authority,
you
say,
no
court
order
can
authorize?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
size
of
that
device?
unknown
speaker
and
that
one?
unknown
speaker
that
was
not
an
unanimous
court,
if
i
am
right?
