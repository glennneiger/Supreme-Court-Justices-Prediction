justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
do
you
--
why
do
you
need
the
all
writs
act,
mr.
wallace?
does
not
41
authorize
the
issuance
of
--
subpoenas
and
discovery
from
persons
not
parties
to
the
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
that
a
sub
--
is
that
a
matter
of
substantive
law
or
of
--
of
the
right
form
of
action
as
you
understand
the
contention?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then
--
when
you
say
to
protect
the
system
against
fraud
and
other
way
of
saying
this
is
to
maximize
the
companyâ€™s
revenues,
is
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
communications
act
did
not
require
you
to
bill
for
all
calls
made,
you
would
not
do
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course
the
typical
recipient
of
a
subpoena,
it
does
not
feel
he
is
entitled
to
strike
the
balance
himself,
you
know,
when
you
subpoena
to
produce
something
before
a
grand
jury,
you
know,
you
are
certainly
privileged
to
argue
that
subpoena
is
unauthorized,
but
i
do
not
think
ordinarily
a
private
organization
feels
that
its
duty
is
to
make
the
decision
as
to
whether
to
produce
them
or
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
not
the
remedy
usually
simply
to
provide
financial
compensation
where
the
issue
of
burdensomeness
is
raised?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
court
did
supply
compensation
for
you,
did
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
have
any
--
do
you
challenge
the
fairness
of
the
compensation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
a
posse
comitatus,
that
certainly
had
traditional
way
in
which
citizens
are
involved
in
the
law
enforcement
process,
is
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
search
warrant
analogy,
though
you
do
not
compel
the
person
whose
place
is
being
searched
to
help
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
you
are
searching
a
hotel
room,
you
do
not
commit
or
you
do
not
order
the
proprietor
of
the
hotel
to
help
so?
