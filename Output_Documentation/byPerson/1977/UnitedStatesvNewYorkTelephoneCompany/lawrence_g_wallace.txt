mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
the
validity
of
an
order
authorizing
fba
--
fbi
agents
to
install
and
use
pen
registers,
as
these
devices
are
commonly
called,
on
two
designated
telephones
and
ordering
the
respondent
telephone
company
to
furnish
all
information,
facilities
and
technical
assistance
needed
to
install
the
pen
registers
unobtrusively.
the
order
was
based
on
a
finding
of
probable
cause
to
believe
that
certain
named
individuals
and
others
unknown
were
conducting
an
illegal
gambling
enterprise
in
violation
of
federal
law
by
the
use
of
the
two
designated
telephones
at
a
certain
address
specified
in
the
order
and
these
findings
were
based
on
an
affidavit
by
an
fbi
agent
showing
the
reasons
for
believing
this
information
to
be
true.
the
sufficiency
of
that
affidavit
and
of
the
order's
specificity
and
reasonableness
under
the
fourth
amendment
are
not
disputed
here,
indictments
have
since
been
returned
with
respect
to
this
investigation
and
motions
to
suppress
have
been
denied,
it
is
in
that
preceding
that
such
issues
would
be
litigated.
now,
the
order
itself
appears
in
the
appendix
at
pages
6
and
7
preceded
by
the
affidavit
incidentally,
the
order
has
considerable
particularity
in
fourth
amendment
terms
and
it
contains
a
couple
of
provisions
to
which
i
want
to
draw
a
particular
attention,
one
is
at
page
7
at
the
conclusion
of
the
first
paragraph.
the
order
specifies
that
the
telephone
company
is
to
be
compensated
for
--
at
the
prevailing
rates
for
providing
the
facilities
and
technical
assistance
required
and
the
other
is
in
the
next
where
for
clause
part
b,
the
purpose
of
the
orders
specified
here,
it
is
to
ascertain
by
the
--
identifying
outgoing
calls,
the
numbers
that
are
dialed
in
outgoing
calls,
to
identify
associates
and
confederates
of
those
who
prior
to
investigation,
including
a
prior
authorized
wire
tap
indicated
were
involved
in
this
enterprise.
and
this
is
for
purposes
in
looking
at
the
outgoing
calls
of
ascertaining
the
scope
of
the
gambling
conspiracy
where
it
is
that
bets
maybe
being
laid
off
as
the
expression
is
when
they
may
receive
more
in
the
way
of
particular
bets
than
they
can
handle
than
confederates,
other
gambling
enterprises
will
be
called
to
see
if
they
can
take
a
portion
of
the
bet
and
this
is
an
investigative
technique
to
indicate
the
scope
of
the
gambling
conspiracy
and
that
was
the
purpose
of
what
was
involved
here.
now
the
pen
registered
devices
themselves
are
familiar
to
this
court.
they
were
involved
in
the
case
of
united
states
against
giordano
and
the
district
court
there
described
in
some
detail,
how
they
operate
and
what
they
do.
they
disclose
only
the
telephone
numbers
that
are
dialed
from
the
telephone
to
which
line
the
device
is
attached.
in
the
absence
of
some
further
attachments
to
the
pen
registered
device
which
are,
were
not
authorized
by
this
order,
the
pen
register
does
not
indicate
whether
any
conversation
is
occurring
over
the
line,
let
alone
hear
any
conversation.
it
does
not
indicate
whether
as
a
result
of
the
dialing.
there
is
a
ring
or
a
busy
signal
at
the
other
end.
how
many
rings?
whether
the
telephone
was
answered?
none
of
that
can
be
ascertained
by
means
of
the
use
of
what
was
authorized
by
this
order.
so,
essentially
the
information
that
is
received,
is
nothing
different
from
what
can
be
secured
from
telephone
company
records
to
the
extent
that
they
are
maintained
of
a
telephone
toll
calls
or
a
message
unit
billing
records,
for
long
distance
calls
every
telephone
company
has
records
that
can
be
secured
without
any
showing
of
probable
cause
by
a
grand
jury
subpoena.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
no
indication
that
there
are
such
records
here.
some
local
telephone
companies
do
keep
track
of
local
calls
and
they
do
have
records
of
them
because
of
billing
practices
based
on
message
units
in
the
limited
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
some
telephone
companies
it
does,
that
is
my
understanding.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
(voice
overlap)
that
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
to
the
extent
that
they
are
available,
they
can
be
secured
that
way.
the
telephone
company
here
says
that
they
are
not
available.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
right.
if
that
should
--
to
the
extent
those
records
are
available,
they
can
be
secured
by
subpoena
(voice
overlap).
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
now,
that
is
correct
and
that
if
the
pen
registered
devices
often
used
by
the
telephone
company
to
ascertain
this
kind
of
thing
for
billing
purposes
and
to
make
its
own
records
when
it
has
or
concerns
relating
to
toll
billing,
but
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
--
it
is
not
shown
in
this
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
directly
does
it
not
show
it,
but
there
is
a
showing
of
this
in
sources
that
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
dealing
with
the
use
of
pen
registers.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
show
that
that
is
the
principal
use
of
pen
registers
by
the
telephone
company
rather
than
by
law
enforcement
official.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
oh
no,
not
on
every
phone,
it
is
just
the
telephone
company
does
use
them.
i
am
sure
that
counsel
for
the
telephone
company
can
shed
more
light
on
this.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
on
the
extent
to
which
they
use
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
have
no
idea--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
have
no
idea
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
it
would
be
a
spot
check
situation
as
mr.
justice
stewart
suggests,
so
far
as
i
am
aware.
the
purpose
of
my
comparison
is
merely
to
point
out
the
very
limited
nature
of
the
information
that
can
be
ascertained
through
the
use
of
these
devices.
many
generalizations
that
are
heard
about
the
evils
of
electronic
surveillance
are
not
responsive
to
the
limited
authorization,
limited
investigatory
technique
that
is
involved
here
which
gives
you
nothing
more
than
what
you
can
get
from
the
telephone
company
with
respect
to
long
distance
calls,
whatever
the
situation
is
with
respect
to
local
calls.
it
is
hard
to
see
why
there
is
a
constitutional
difference
between
local
and
long
distance
calls
for
these
purposes
and
those
records,
that
is
not
contested,
would
be
available
under
this
court’s
decision
that
is
analogous
to
this
in
united
states
against
miller
with
respect
to
bank
records
and
more
specifically
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
some
years
ago
addressed
this
question
in
a
case
cited
in
brief
called
united
states
against
gallo,
a
panel
consisting
of
the
two
judges,
hand
and
judge
swan
who
wrote
the
opinion,
holding
that
the
evidence
was
competent,
taken
from
the
telephone
company
by
subpoena,
showing
calls
between
a
telephone
in
the
appellant’s
home
and
telephones
registered
in
the
names
of
certain
codefendants
who
pleaded
guilty.
it
was
of
limited
probative
value
because
it
shows
nothing,
but
the
existence
of
such
calls,
but
it
was
admissible
and
the
admission
was
upheld
and
the
court
explained
there,
that
this
was
not
a
violation
of
section
605
of
the
communications
act
which
at
that
time
forbade
the
telephone
company
or
anyone
else
from
disclosing
the
contents
of
wire
communications.
the
statute
they
held,
i
wish
i
had
known
about
this
in
connection
with
united
states
against
miller,
i
wish
i
had
known
about
this
case,
the
statute
was
not
intended
to
prescribe
long
standing
reasonable
business
practices
of
communication
companies.
when
a
person
takes
up
a
telephone,
he
knows
that
the
company
will
make
or
may
make
some
kind
of
a
record
of
the
event
and
he
must
be
deemed
to
consent
to
whatever
record
the
business
convenience
of
the
company
requires.
if
by
any
stretch
of
the
language
of
section
605
which
no
longer
applies
in
this
area,
the
making
of
such
a
record
could
be
termed
as
interception
of
the
communication,
it
is
one
which
the
sender
has
authorized,
hence
it
is
not
within
the
ban
of
the
statute.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
cited.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
united
states
against
gallo.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
was
just
reading
from
the
opinion,
a
pertinent
portion,
which
goes
to
this
question
to
the
extent
of
what
is
involved
here
could
be
characterized
as
a
communication
at
all,
it
is
a
communication
to
the
telephone
company
requesting
service,
the
dialing
of
the
number.
it
is
not
the
kind
of
communication
that
either
the
old
section
605
or
current
statutes
have
been
concerned
about.
now,
in
response
to
the
order,
the
telephone
company
here
did
furnish
all
the
information
required
to
enable
the
fbi
to
do
the
installation
itself,
identifying
where
the
lines
could
be
found
in
that
sort
of
thing
and
if
there
had
not
been
compliance
to
that
extent,
the
fbi
would
have
been
physically
unable
to
carry
out
the
order.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
not
necessarily
court
consent,
we
think
that
it
--
it
would
require
a
warrant
that
can
be
issued
by
a
federal
magistrate.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
absent
exigence
circumstances
at
least.
there
is
that
exception.
the
warrant
requirement
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
no
statutory
reason
why
it
would
not
apply
here.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
here
we
did
secure
a
warrant,
based
on
a
finding
of
probable
cause.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
my
understanding
is
that
these
records
are
not
available.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
could
have
done
that.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
needed
a
warrant
to
install
the
pen
register
to
ascertain
all
numbers
that
are
being
dialed
from
these
telephones
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
they
show
it
indeed
in
their
criminal
investigation
to
get
the
numbers
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
could
be
argued
that
they
could
it
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
it
might
follow.
it
has
been
argued
in
some
of
the
literature
that
they
could.
we
think
that
the
implications
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decisions
on
this
question
and
of
the
opinion
agreed
to
by
four
members
of
this
court
in
united
states
against
giordano
is
that
there
is
a
search
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment
involved
here
and
in
order
to
conduct
the
search
where
there
is
time
to
get
a
warrant,
we
ordinarily
will
get
a
warrant
on
that
showing.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
are
not,
not
at
all.
we
are
not
involved
with
a
tap
in
this
case
or
what
is
commonly
called
the
tap.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
installed
by;
it
is
installed
to
the
line.
it
is
a
tap
in
that
sense,
but
it
is
not
a
tap
that
enables
you
to
listen
on
line.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
way
that
it
normally
is
done
in
order
for
it
to
be
it
done
unobtrusively
is
by
leasing
a
line
from
the
telephone
company
which
the
telephone
company
can
indicate
how
that
line
can
be
connected
at
a
box
where
the
two
lines
emerge
to
the
telephone
that
you
want
to
attach
the
pen
register
to
and
then
the
leased
line
can
be
extended
to
a
location
where
the
pen
register
can
be
attached
to
the
leased
line,
otherwise
cables
would
have
to
be
attached
to
the
box
in
the
apartment
building
or
on
the
back
of
the
building
where
the
telephone
line
makes
what
is
called
an
appearance,
in
order
to
have
a
line
to
which
the
pen
register
could
be
attached
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
was
the
precise
problem
here.
while
the
telephone
company
was
willing
to
provide
the
information,
it
was
not
willing
to
lease
the
line
to
the
fbi
which
would
enable
the
fbi
to
install
the
pen
register
unobtrusively
without
having
to
string
cables
and
instead
the
telephone
company
suggested
to
the
fbi
that
they
should
string
their
own
cables
from
this
apartment
building
in
order
to
install
the
pen
register
and
comply
with
the
order
and
after
(voice
overlap)
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
do
have
them,
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
would
have
provided
their
own,
although
if
it
would
have
been
agreeable
to
them,
if
the
telephone
company
had
wanted
to
install
its
pen
registers.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that,
but
the
registers
here
were
fbi
property.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
are
pictures,
i
do
not
know,
precisely,
but
the
point
is
that
the
fbi
made
a
4-day
surveillance
of
the
neighborhood
knowing
that
counter
surveillance
techniques
were
being
used
by
this
gambling
enterprise
which
had
a
history,
the
record
shows,
of
changes
of
address
and
changes
of
telephone
numbers
quite
frequently
and
they
concluded
that
they
could
not
execute
the
warrant
unobtrusively
without
the
leased
line.
sending
agents
into
string
the
lines
there
would
have
resulted
in
cessation
of
the
gambling
activities
and
frustration
of
the
court’s
order.
so,
in
the
meantime,
the
telephone
company
filed
a
motion
in
the
case
seeking
vacation
of
that
part
of
the
order
requiring
them
to
provide
facilities
and
that
order
was
denied
in
all
respects
by
the
district
court,
but
granted
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
a
two
to
one
decision.
the
majority
agreeing
with
the
court
of
appeals
with
the
seventh
circuit
in
a
prior
decision,
and
since
then
the
eighth
circuit
has
also
agreed
with
this,
held
that
the
district
court
did
have
authority
to
authorize
the
fbi
to
install
the
pen
register
and
it
assumed
arguendo
that
there
was
also
authority
that
inherently
or
under
the
all
writs
act
to
require
the
telephone
company
to
provide
the
assistance
to
enable
that
order
to
be
carried
out,
but
it
held
that
it
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
in
the
absence
of
specific
legislative
authority
on
this
subject
how
it
exercised
that
authority
on
the
basis
of
what
might
be
called
the
first
step
down
to
slippery
slope
kind
of
rationale.
what
is
significant
for
our
purposes
in
the
opinion,
it
can
be
found
in
paragraph
on
pages
13a
and
14a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
specifies
that
what
it
calls
the
most
persuasive
point
argued
by
the
government
in
support
of
the
order
is
that
without
the
appellant’s
technical
aid,
the
order
authorizing
the
use
of
a
pen
register
will
be
worthless.
federal
law
enforcement
agents
simply
cannot
implement
pen
register
surveillance
without
the
telephone
company’s
help.
the
assistance
request
did
require
no
extraordinary
expenditure
of
time
or
effort
by
appellant.
indeed
as
we
understand
it,
providing
lease
or
private
lines
is
relatively
simple
routine
procedure
and
i
will
interject
there
that
the
dissenting
judge
specified,
this
is
on
page
20a
of
the
appendix,
that
the
telephone
company
concedes
that
the
assistance
require
that
was
not
burdensome,
all
that
was
required
was
the
provision
of
certain
plans
and
the
flicking
of
a
switch
at
the
central
terminal.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
court
did.
the
court
cited
section
2520
of
title
xviii
which
is
part
of
title
iii
of
the
omnibus
crime
control
act
of
1968
and
that
provision
specifies
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
deals
with
both
civil
and
criminal
liability
and
it
specifies
that
a
good
faith
reliance
on
a
court
order
or
on
legislative
authorization
shall
constitute
a
complete
defense
to
any
civil
or
criminal
action
brought
under
this
chapter
or
under
any
other
law.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
referred
to
certain
other
legislation
that
would
grant
immunity
from
liability.
the
finding
here
was
that
because
of
section
2520,
the
telephone
company
need
have
no
fear
of
liability
if
it
acts
pursuant
to
a
court
order
and
of
course
the
order
provides
for
financial
remuneration
to
the
company.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
am
not
aware
of
any
pending
legislation,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
now,
the
argument
that
respondent
seeks
to
renew
here,
although
it
did
not
petition
and
we
have
agreed
that
it
is
sufficiently
closely
connected
with
the
rest
of
what
else
is
at
issue,
that
it
should
be
considered
by
the
court.
the
title
iii
governs
this.
it
seems
to
us
to
have
been
adequately
answered
in
--
of
the
concurring
and
dissenting
opinion
filed
by
four
justices
in
giordano
and
i
will
have
to
leave
that
argument
to
their
opinion
and
to
the
brief.
the
legislative
history
is
very
specific
on
that
point
that
pen
registers
are
not
covered
and
that
it
was
the
content
of
the
communication
rather
than
the
fact
of
the
communication
that
was
to
be
protected.
what
remains
here
are
the
question
about
the
validity
of
the
order
with
respect
to
the
authorization
itself
which
we
think
rule
41
applies
to,
has
it
seems
to
us
the
court
of
appeals
assumed
in
katz
and
osborne
with
respect
to
seizure
of
intangible
and
electrical
impulses
of
this
sort
or
since
it
sometimes
referred
to
as
an
order
in
the
nature
of
a
search
warrant,
one
could
instead
resort
to
rule
57
(b)
of
the
criminal
rules,
which
authorizes
the
district
court
to
proceed
in
any
manner
not
prohibited
elsewhere.
but
either
way,
the
protections
of
the
fourth
amendment
are
satisfied
in
this
area
and
the
rule
with
some
adaptation
because
it
does
not
specify,
it
is
not
drafted
in
terms
of
a
durational
search
of
the
sort
that
is
involved
here.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
really
are
relying
on
rule
41.
rule
57
(b),
i
think
gives
some
authority
to
proceed
in
a
nature
of
rule
41,
when
the
terms
of
rule
41
need
to
be
varied
somewhat,
because
of
the
kind
(voice
overlap)
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
have
not
made
that
contention.
i
do
not
want
to
concede
that
it
is
not,
however.
we
think
rule
41
is
satisfactory
for
our
purposes
here
and
that
the
issue
then
becomes
whether
when
an
order
issued
under
rule
41
cannot
be
carried
out
without
the
technical
assistance
of
a
third
party,
whether
a
court
or
the
telephone
company
in
this
case
is
to
decide
whether
the
order
will
be
carried
out.
we
think
the
court
has
ample
authority
under
the
all
writs
act
to
effectuate
its
order,
as
has
been
done
in
many
situations
involving
injunctive
orders
to
third
parties,
including
cases
in
which
convictions
have
been
upheld
for
contempt
of
such
injunctions
when
they
are
issued
to
uphold
school
desegregation
decrees
for
example
and
there
are
other
examples
which
i
really
do
not
have
time
to
go
into.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
it
does,
but
the
contention
that
is
being
made
is
that,
it
does
not
authorize
the
requirement
of
an
unwilling
third
party
assist
in
the
execution
of
a
search
warrant.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
the
contention
is
a
matter
of
substantive
law,
but
i
am
not
sure,
i
am
not
sure
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
but
there
is
a
long
history
of
the
use
of
such
matters
and
if
i
may
i
just
want
to
refer
the
court
to
one
case,
the
united
states
against
mchie,
which
is
not
cited
in
the
briefs,
196
federal
reporter
586,
which
i
informed
opposing
counsel
about
last
week,
one
has
to
go
back
here
to
1912
to
find
an
answer
being
made
in
some
detail
to
the
contention
that
the
all
writs
act
does
not
permit
writs
to
be
issued
to
third
parties
and
the
court's
answer
at
that
time
was
that
has
not
been
the
practice
at
all.
there
have
been
many
instances
for
the
use
of
the
all
writs
act
in
its
history
for
that
purpose.
it
has
been
true
of
injunction,
execution,
subpoena,
testificandum,
subpoena
duces
takem,
writ
of
prohibition,
etc.
it
is
an
argument
that
one
has
to
go
back
into
history
to
find
an
answer
for
and
if
i
may,
i
would
like
the
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
have
three
brief
points,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
the
first
place,
even
though
the
telephone
company
is
here
challenging
the
authority
to
issue
the
warrant
under
rule
41,
it
did
comply
in
part,
it
did
everything
that
was
required
of
it
under
the
warrant
except
the
leasing
of
the
line
and
it
well
might
have
felt
some
obligation
to
do
so.
it
is
not
standing
here
in
the
shoes
of
an
ordinary
third
party,
an
innocent
bystander.
it
is
not
only
as
a
public
utility,
but
there
is
a
finding
of
probable
cause
to
believe
that
its
facilities,
which
it
is
operating
for
a
profit
or
being
used
in
the
conduct
of
an
enterprise
violating
the
criminal
law
in
the
circumstances
where
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
conduct
the
enterprise
without
the
use
of
the
telephone
company’s
facilities
and
that
matter
should
not
be
lost
sight
of,
when
arguments
are
made,
generalizing
about
bystanders
and
whether
courts
can
impose
duties
on
them.
the
second
point
is,
that
title
iii,
not
only
does
the
legislative
history
specifically
disclaim
that
it
is
intended
to
limit
the
use
of
pen
registers,
but
if
title
iii
were
to
be
applied
in
this
area,
it
would
be
a
very
serious
interference
with
legitimate
use
of
pen
registers
in
criminal
investigations.
title
iii,
because
it
deals
with
wire
tapping,
overhearing
the
contents
of
telephone
communications
is
very
restricted,
not
only
are
there
conversant
procedures
to
follow
which
are
quite
time
consuming,
but
the
list
of
crimes
for
which
it
can
be
used
is
quite
limited,
whereas
pen
registers
can
be
very
useful
in
the
investigation
of
a
escaped
fugitive
offenses,
civil
rights
act
offenses
and
various
others
that
we
have
mentioned
in
the
footnote
in
our
brief
that
are
not
covered
by
title
iii.
since
we
here
complied
with
all
the
requirements
that
would
be
necessary
in
order
to
be
able
to
get
a
search
warrant,
to
go
into
someone’s
premises
and
search
through
his
papers,
there
is
no
reason
to
limit
a
far
less
intrusive
investigatory
technique
which
can
be
very
useful
in
these
areas
of
detecting
criminal
activity
and
finally
(voice
overlap)
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
this
is
--
it
is
not
the
individual
whose
telephone
is
being
used,
who
is
compelled
to
help
in
these
circumstances,
it
is
the
telephone
company
who
facilitates
are
being
used.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
maybe
circumstances
in
which
he
can
be
asked
to
cooperate
in
executing
the
search
if
his
help
is
needed
to
gain
access.
there
is
a
provision
in
title
xviii,
section
3105
which
indicates
that
when
needed,
persons
can
be
required
to
help
in
the
execution
of
a
search
warrant.
we
do
not
rely
on
that
here,
but
it
is
not
an
unprecedented
or
unheard
of
thing.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
that
is
the
kind
of
help
that
i
am
speaking
of
and
we
frequently
do
get
that
kind
of
help
when
someone
is
operating
a
facility
for
profit
and
that
facility
is
being
used
in
furtherance
of
criminal
enterprise,
at
least
there
is
a
probable
cause
to
believe
that.
my
final
point
is,
what
about
the
absence
of
action
by
congress
here
other
than
its
indication
and
the
legislative
history
of
title
iii,
that
the
use
of
pen
registers
is
not
to
be
restricted.
the
contention
of
the
telephone
company
in
effect
is
that
in
the
absence
of
action
by
congress,
the
telephone
company
rather
than
the
court
is
to
decide
whether
an
order
of
this
kind
can
be
carried
out
when
the
telephone
company’s
facilities
are
needed,
but
i
think
that
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court
is
to
the
contrary.
of
course,
congress
is
free
to
act.
there
is
a
case
sited
at
page
18a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
by
judge
mansfield
in
his
dissenting
opinion.
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
there
is
a
quotation
from,
this
is
page
18a,
there
is
a
quotation
from
this
court’s
opinion
in
adams
v.
united
states
ex
rel.mccann,
in
which
a
unanimous
court
speaking
through
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
it
was
unanimous
on
this
point,
upheld
the
authority
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
issue
a
writ
habeas
corpus
in
circumstances
where
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
there
were
obstacles
to
the
taking
of
a
pro
se
appeal
that
warranted
using
habeas
corpus
for
review.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
they
split
on
the
merits,
but
they
were
unanimous
that
it
was
proper
for
the
court
of
appeals
in
that
case
to
use
the
extraordinary
writ
and
the
point
that
i
want
to
make
is
that
the
quotation
that
appears
in
the
middle
of
the
page
there
leaves
out
the
first
part
of
the
sentence,
but
the
first
part
of
the
sentence
by
a
careful
judicial
craftsman,
speaking
on
behalf
of
the
court,
reads,
“unless
appropriately
confined
by
congress,
a
federal
court
may
etc.,”the
idea
is
that
in
the
absence
of
action
by
congress,
there
is
power
in
the
courts
and
it
should
be
exercised
in
order
to
effectuate
the
court’s
orders
and
if
congress
wants
to
specify
another
method
of
preceding,
that
of
course
is
part
of
the
legislative
authority
and
that
is
one
reason
why
we
think
it
is
more
respectful
of
that
authority
to
rely
on
the
all
writs
act
rather
than
a
concept
of
inherent
power
which
some
of
the
court
of
appeals
had
preferred
in
this
area,
but
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
in
the
absence
of
action
by
congress,
someone
other
than
the
court
should
decide
whether
these
warrants
should
be
effectuated.
