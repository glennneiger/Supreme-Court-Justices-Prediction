mr.
george
e.
ashley
mr.
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
new
york
telephone
company
is
pleased
that
the
court
has
granted
certiorari
in
this
case
to
resolve
the
--
to
provide
guidance
and
to
resolve
the
conflict
that
exists
in
the
circuits
as
to
the
right
of
the
government
to
proceed
to
get
the
orders
for
the
installation
of
pen
registers
and
to
order
the
affirmative
assistance
of
the
telephone
company,
when
it
has
not
chosen
to
proceed
under
title
iii
of
the
omnibus
crime
act
of
1968.
we
of
course
have
no
desire
to
obstruct
law
enforcement
authorities
in
the
discharge
of
their
vital
functions
and
in
fact
we
have
a
long
history
of
extensive
cooperation
in
that
regard.
at
the
same
time,
we
also
have
a
long
standing
policy
of
protecting
the
privacy
of
communications
to
the
maximum
extent
that
is
feasible
with
the
needs
of
a
law
enforcement
when
those
exceptions
are
spelled
out
by
clear
requirements
of
law.
while
we
believe,
we
do
have
a
legitimate
concern
with
potential
civil
liability
if
the
orders
that
are
here
sought
are
not
lawful
and
there
have
been
a
of
number
cases
in
which
the
telephone
companies
have
been
sued
because
we
are
sort
of
in
the
middle
in
this
kind
of
situation,
nevertheless
our
primary
purpose
for
being
here
and
in
cooperating
in
bringing
this
matter
before
the
court
is
because
of
its
implications
for
the
protection
of
the
privacy
of
communications.
given
the
extent
to
which
the
telephone
system
is
used
for
social
and
business
intercourse
in
this
country,
we
believe
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
rights
of
a
free
society
to
have
the
privacy
invaded
anymore
than
it
is
found
to
be
warranted
by
the
clear
definitions
and
exceptions
in
the
statutes.
this
court
and
congress
have
long
been
concerned
with
balancing
these
two
interests.
the
history
goes
back
to
the
olmstead
case
in
1928
and
then
to
the
nardone
case
in
the
30s
when
this
court,
on
its
own
initiative
instituted
the
exclusionary
rule
and
then
you
come
on
down
through
the
many
cases
intervening
to
the
cases
in
the
60s,
osborne,
katz
and
burger,
which
left
the
whole
matter
so
complex
and
confused
around
the
country,
that
congress
addressed
that
head
on
in
enacting
the
omnibus
crime
and
safe
treats
control
act
in
1968.
and
title
iii
of
that
act
deals
very
extensively
with
the
whole
matter
of
electronic
surveillance
and
we
believe
that
the
senate
report
indicates
that
congress
intended
to
legislate
comprehensively
and
preemptively
that
in
the
area
of
electronic
surveillance
--
mr.
george
e.
ashley
it
agrees,
i
think
that
title
iii
is
a
very
sweeping
and
very
comprehensive
in
the
scope.
it
does
not
agree
that
the
requirement
for
a
pen
register
is
covered
by
title
iii.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
and
we
think
that
is
certainly
a
serious
question.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
we
believe
that
it
is
implicit
in
the
issue
that
is
here
because
there
would
be
no
authority
to
order
the
telephone
company
to
provide
the
lease
line
facilities
unless
the
court
also
decides
that
the
basic
underlying
order
was
properly
granted.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
you
are
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
well,
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
--
that
the
government
also
believes
that
this
is
subsumed
in
the
issue
that
it
is
before
the
court
--
mr.
george
e.
ashley
no,
i
think
that
is
true,
but
i
think
if
the
court
goes
--
handles
this
case
and
passes
upon
the
requirement
that
the
telephone
company
provide
lease
line
facilities
under
these
circumstances,
then
it
will
for
the
first
time
really
have
come
to
grips
with
the
issue
as
to
whether
pen
register
can
be
issued
outside
the
scope
of
title
iii
and
this
court
up
to
that
--
this
time
has
not
specifically
addressed
that.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
yes.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
yes,
we
do.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
we
are
saying
that
this
case
being
properly
before
the
court,
that
that
issue
ought
also
be
addressed
head
on
by
the
court
because
of
the
wide
disagreement,
not
by
circuits,
but
there
had
been
other
--
mr.
george
e.
ashley
well,
judge
oliver
in
the
western
district
of
missouri
felt
so.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
i
think
the
matter
is
fully
briefed
your
honor
and
both
the
government’s
brief
--
mr.
george
e.
ashley
it
would
be
finding
that
the
basic
underlying
order
is
not
warranted
and
that
is
not
a
finding
that
has
been
made
by
the
court
below.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
we
merely
here
--
mr.
george
e.
ashley
our
position
with
respect
to
--
mr.
george
e.
ashley
i
am
sorry
your
honor,
i
did
not
understand.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
the
relief
that
was
allowed
below,
it
really
goes
to
the
issue
of
the
extent
of
the
order
that
should
be
directed
to
the
telephone
company
and
that
is
the
matter
that
does
directly
impinge
upon
us
and
it
is
(voice
overlap)
mr.
george
e.
ashley
if
a
different
resulted
had
been
really
reached
as
to
whether
the
title
iii
order
was
warranted
in
the
first
place,
there
would
have
been
no
need
to
reach
the
second
order.
there
would
been
no
order
to
the
telephone
company
at
all
in
all
the
circumstances.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
we
believe
that
it
is
inherently
involved
in
the
issue
(voice
overlap)
before
the
court.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
there
are
various
cases
to
that
affect
cited
in
the
government's
brief
in
which
they
agree
that
the
issue
(voice
overlap)
mr.
george
e.
ashley
yes.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
well,
before
i
move
on
from
that
point,
i
am
merely
here
urging
because
of
the
fundamental
nature
of
it
and
because
that
issue
has
not
been
directly
addressed
by
this
court
even
though
there
are
no
numerous
decisions,
assuming
that
pen
register
orders
are
outside
the
scope
of
title
iii,
that
this
court
in
providing
guidance
to
the
court’s
around
the
country,
not
start
with
the
predisposition
and
with
a
closed
mind
with
respect
to
that,
but
instead
address
that
issue
in
this
case,
so
that
it
will
not
be
merely
assumed
without
being
addressed
and
analyzed.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
not
the
record
itself,
but
the
briefs
and
the
statements
that
we
had
made,
in
fact,
we
state
positively
that
the
customer
use
of
pen
registers
is
for
very
limited
purposes
within
the
operation
of
the
telephone
business.
for
example,
we
maybe
need
--
we
maybe
required
to
check
on
the
accuracy
of
billing
and
we
need,
this
is
the
way
in
that
is
done,
we
may
in
certain
difficult
situations
where
there
are
harassing
calls
and
things
of
that
sort,
we
may
need
to
--
to
trace
that
call.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
no,
no
--
mr.
george
e.
ashley
yes
and
in
other
circumstances
through
--
mr.
george
e.
ashley
well
your
honor,
i
---
i
--
i
hesitate
to
accept
that
characterization.
there
is
certain
service
of
deserving
that
is
done
on
the
way
in
which
operators
handle
a
call,
but
when
that
is
done,
those
are
timed
out,
so
that
they
do
not
go
into
the
conversation
itself.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
and
the
pen
register
that
we
are
talking
about
when
it
is,
we
do
it
only
at
the
extent
to
prevent
fraud
and
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
system,
so
that
there
is
no
violation
of
--
mr.
george
e.
ashley
this
is
one
by
the
government
in
which
they
want
to
intercept
and
listen
in.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
yes
sir,
but
that
--
that
the
extent
to
which
government
has
been
permitted
to
use
pen
registers
has
a
long
history.
it
goes
back
to
the
enactment
of
the
communications
act
in
1934
and
for
the
entire
period
of
time,
from
1934
until
the
passage
of
the
act
in
1968,
the
use
of
pen
registers
by
law
enforcement
authorities
was
prohibited
by
section
605
and
the
case
was
unanimous
--
mr.
george
e.
ashley
no,
the
gallo
case
had
to
do
with
securing
the
total
records
of
the
telephone
company
under
subpoena,
not
with
the
use
of
pen
registers.
in
fact
at
--
in
a
much,
much
later
case,
the
dote
case,
when
the
government
secured
the
pen
register
information,
where
the
telephone
company
had
used
the
pen
register
in
the
regular
course
of
its
business,
it
was
found
that
that
was
an
unauthorized
interception
by
the
government,
that
they
have
no
right
to
those
pen
registers.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
they
use
them
when
there
is
a
complaint
about
a
billing
error
to
check
the
dialing,
to
see
whether
the
machinery
is
working
properly
and
so
that
the
party
is
truly
billed
for
the
number
of
calls
that
they
make.
they
maybe
required
in
certain
instances,
limited
instances
to
trace
calls
and
that
is
done
with
the
consent
of
the
party
and
as
mr.
justice
marshall
has
brought
out,
in
order
to
protect
the
system
against
fraud
to
prevent,
you
know,
the
use
of
blue
boxes
and
things
which
--
which
may
call
--
enable
them
to
making
calls
without
the
charging
on
a
selective
basis,
there
is
that
sort
---
mr.
george
e.
ashley
oh!
yes.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
it
is
not
ordinarily
done
and
i
am
also
telling
the
court
that
throughout
the
long
history
of
the
use
of
pen
registers,
that
there
has
been
exceptions
in
the
law
for
the
limited
use
by
telephone
companies
in
the
necessary
conduct
to
the
business
and
that
has
been
one
set
of
rules
and
the
extent
to
which
law
enforcement
authorities
have
had
the
right
to
use
pen
registers
has
been
governed
by
--
has
been
prohibited
by
statute
until
1968.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
well,
we
are
required
under
the
communications
act
to
bill
for
all
calls
that
are
made
and
if
parties
are
unable
to
bypass
the
billing
mechanism
and
so
forth
and
perpetuate
fraud
on
the
system,
we
are
in
no
position
then
to
carry
out
our
responsibility
under
the
communications
act
to
provide
service
without
discrimination
and
to
bill
for
all
calls
that
are
made.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
well,
we
also
have
an
independent
interest
in
saying
that
we
hope
to
lose
the
revenue
as
well.
yes,
your
honor,
of
course.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
that
is
correct.
it
would
be
an
unlawful
rebate
or
it
would
be
discriminatory
as
between
customers,
if
that
were
to
be
--
that
end
result
were
to
be
permitted.
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
george
e.
ashley
excuse
me?
mr.
george
e.
ashley
yes,
there
are
efforts
to
do
that.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
yes,
we
would
require
a
subpoena
and
but
prior
to
--
if
you
go
back
to
the
dote
case
which
is
no
longer
the
law
because
now
it
would
be
ruled
by
whatever
the
provisions
of
the
omnibus
crime
bill
are,
whereas
dote
arose
under
section
605,
but
the
dote
case
was
a
case
in
which
the
telephone
company
had
pen
register
information,
turned
it
over
to
the
law
enforcement
agencies
and
this
was
held
to
be
an
unlawful
acquisition
of
that
information
by
the
law
enforcement
agencies.
in
other
words,
if
the
telephone
company
had
pen
register
information
as
distinguished
from
total
billing
records,
those
were
not
available
to
law
enforcement
agencies.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
yes,
of
course.
i
would
like
to
move
to
the
second
issue
because
while
i
do
urge
the
court
to
address
this
underlying
issue
because
there
have
been
numerous
decisions
that
have
been
assumed
that
title
iii
permitted
that
pen
register
surveillances
outside
title
iii
and
four
justices
of
this
court
in
the
concurring
and
dissenting
opinion
in
giordano
assumed
the
same,
so
it
is
quite
an
uphill
struggle,
nevertheless,
i
do
not
believe
the
issue
has
been
directly
addressed
and
i
urge
you
to
do
that.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
yes,
that
is
correct
and
we
add
to
that
argument
justice
stevens,
that
given
the
intent
of
congress
to
act
so
comprehensively
in
this
area
and
the
long
history
that
is
behind
it,
we
believe
that
there
ought
not
to
be
assumed
to
be
an
inherent
power
and
that
since
rule
41
also
does
not
cover
it
because
the
nature
of
the
rule,
dealing
with
intangibles,
the
fact
that
there
are
numerous
reasons
that
are
set
forth
in
our
brief,
we
believe
that
title
iii
ought
to
be
covered
any
use
that
is
made
a
pen
registers
or
else
there
should
be
(voice
overlap)
for
legislation.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
if
they
proceed
under
title
iii,
they
can.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
but
not
elsewhere,
yes.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
we
believe
that
pen
registers
being
a
lesser
invasion
of
privacy
than
full
wire
tapping
capability
are
within
the
power
of
the
courts
to
authorize
under
title
iii.
if
--
mr.
george
e.
ashley
well,
if
we
are
wrong
about
that
then
we
see
no
authority
--
mr.
george
e.
ashley
yes,
we
believe
that
if
they
follow
the
procedures
under
title
iii
and
they
are
getting
pen
registers
across
the
country
and
we
have
not
resisted
cooperating
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
this
is
on
the
second
issue
at
which
i
would
like
to
turn
because
i
believe
that
it
is
a
very
fundamental
issue
and
it
is
justice
rehnquist,
from
our
perspective
a
substantive
issue
as
well
as
a
procedure
of
issue
and
that
is
the
extent
to
which
courts
have
the
power
to
order
private
citizens,
even
telephone
companies
to
actively
participate
in
the
act
of
criminal
investigation
without
explicit
statutory
authority
to
do
so.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
oh!
yes
sir.
we
do
not
deny
that
there
is,
but
we
believe
that
we
are
private
citizens
and
our
employees
are
private
employees
with
private
employer
except
to
the
extent
that
depicts,
you
know,
special
duties
and
responsibilities
have
been
imposed
upon
us
by
the
regulatory
statutes
and
there
are
no
questions
that
what
goes
over
there.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
what
we
have
done
in
the
way
of
voluntary
cooperation,
we
believe
are
within
the
scope
of
our
privileges
and
rights
as
a
private
employer
and
we
have
responded
in
those
instances
to
the
extent
that
we
believe
it
is
--
mr.
george
e.
ashley
no,
we
are
not
rejecting
that,
but
we
say
the
extent
to
which
that
exists
is
spelled
out
by
statutes
and
it
should
be
spelled
out
by
statutes
rather
than
be
something
that
we
would
assumed
ourselves
without
any
--
any
limits.
particularly
in
this
instance
in
which
we
would
be
cooperating
in
the
invasion
of
the
private
use
in
the
telephone
system,
without
explicit
statute
authority
to
that
effect.
we
do
not
believe
we
should
assume
to
do
that
through
any
inherent
obligation
of
a
public
utility.
we
believe
that
should
be
spelled
out.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
yes,
we
believe
that
there
is
no
actual
power.
we
believe
the
ninth
circuit
so
held
in
the
application
of
the
united
states
case
in
1970
which
was
a
title
iii
case,
but
on
this
issue,
this
secondary
issue,
as
to
the
obligation
of
the
telephone
company
whether
it
is
appropriate
for
a
court
to
order
the
provision
lease
facilities
and
the
active
involvement
of
the
telephone
company.
on
that
issue,
we
believe
the
ninth
circuit
decision
is
indistinguishable
on
the
facts
from
this
and
what
happened
there
was
that
the
telephone
--
that
the
telephone
company
was
ordered
to
provide
lease
lines
as
here,
but
in
the
title
iii
situation
the
court,
the
ninth
circuit
held
it
had
no
such
power.
it
could
find
no
such
power
to
order
it
and
felt
it
would
be
unwise
to
do
so
without
specific
statutory
authority
and
subsequent
to
that
then
it
was
taken
to
congress.
congress
did
enact
a
statute
which
authorized
that
the
telephone
companies
to
provide
lease
lines
when
title
iii
orders
were
secured
and
under
those
circumstances
provided
immunity
in
the
statute,
the
immunity
to
which,
my
learned
colleague
here
has
--
has
--
made
illusion,
but
he
is
giving
us,
he
is
relying
upon
the
very
statute
that
he
says
they
do
not
need
to
follow
in
securing
the
underlying
authority.
he
would
--
he
would
use
the
very
title
iii
which
he
says,
does
not
apply
to
this
case
and
which
they
do
not
have
to
follow
as
a
basis
to
give
us
the
immunity
which
i
find
very
strange.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
no,
not
in
this
respect
we
are
not
relying
upon
our
rights
as
a
private
citizen,
under
both
the
605,
the
communications
act
before
1968
and
under
the
omnibus
crime
bill
in
1968.
exception
was
made
for
the
telephone
company
in
the
necessary
conduct
of
its
business
to
do
that.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
well,
only
to
the
extent
necessary
to
carry
out
its
--
its
functions
as
a
telephone
company.
if
we
--
if
we
exceeded
appropriate,
you
know,
bounds
in
that
respect
we
would
not
be
protected
either.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
well,
and
i
would
say
in
title
iii,
in
title
iii,
it
is
12
o’clock
here.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
continue
on
the
point
that
regardless
of
the
validity
of
the
underlying
title
iii
order
in
so
far
as
it
authorized
the
government
that
the
court
had
no
power
to
order
the
telephone
company
to
actively
participate
in
the
act
of
a
criminal
investigation.
i
would
just
like
to
say
that
this
is
another
example
of
where
we
try
to
strike
a
reasonable
balance
between
the
degree
of
involvement
of
the
communications
common
carrier
with
a
need
for
the
efficient
carrying
out
of
the
requirements
of
law
enforcement.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
no
i
think,
generally
speaking
that
is
true,
of
course
there
are
(voice
overlap)
mr.
george
e.
ashley
yes,
that
was
the
distinction
i
was
going
to
make.
preliminary
to
that
i
was
going
to
say
to
justice
rehnquist
that
private
parties
may
raise
the
question
of
the
burdensomeness
of
course
of
the
subpoena
and
so
forth
and
appeal
to
the
sense
of
equity
of
the
court,
but
i
think
(voice
overlap)
mr.
george
e.
ashley
that
certainly
is
a
major
factor
in
whether
the
court
would
decide
to
go
that
far
--
mr.
george
e.
ashley
it
is
prepared
to
pay
for
the
use
of
the
facilities
at
the
regular
tariff
rate,
yes.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
no,
we
do
not.
that
is
not
the
basis.
the
basis
is
really
the
precedent
for
us
and
for
citizens
in
general
of
requiring
affirmative
participation
and
acts
in
a
criminal
investigative
process.
we
believe
there
is
no
precedent
for
that.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
we
do
that
only
in
the
conduct
for
our
own
business
within
what
we,
you
know,
it
is
lawful.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
yes
and
so
do
all
citizens
and
all
individuals,
but
it
is
extraordinary
to
expect
citizens
to
directly
involve
themselves
in
the
law
enforcement
process.
the
ninth
circuit
found
that
there
was
no
precedent
for
that
and
when
the
matter
was
presented
to
congress,
then
congress
did
amend
title
iii
and
provide
that
this
should
be
done,
but
only
when
there
was
a
title
iii
order.
it
did
not
go
beyond
that
and
authorized
it,
except
within
those
very
strict
requirements
of
title
iii.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
yes,
you
have
the
precedent
of
the
posse
comitatus.
you
have
the
precedent
of
individual
citizens
in
an
emergency
situations
where
a
felon
maybe
escaping
and
a
law
enforcement
officer
asked
for
assistance,
there
are
a
couple
of
cases
of
that
sort
that
are
cited
in
the
petition
by
the
cert
--
by
the
government.
one
was
the
opinion
by
judge
cardozo
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
new
york
and
another
was
here
in
washington,
involving
the
evening
star,
but
those
incidents
are
really
a
time
honored
marshaling
of
the
resources
of
the
community
in
an
emergency
situation
which
the
ninth
circuit
said,
it
was
unwilling
to
find
was
a
precedent
for
the
kind
of
thing
which
is
at
bar
here
which
is
ahead
of
judgment
and
without
the
emergency
condition
(voice
overlap)
mr.
george
e.
ashley
i
was
responding
to
--
to
the
analogy
to
the
possee
comitatus.
they
specifically
refused
--
mr.
george
e.
ashley
well,
we
are
on
the
issue
as
to
whether
the
telephone
company
could
be
required
to
--
mr.
george
e.
ashley
and
--
and
they
found
no
authority
for
doing
that.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
no,
i
do
not
think
so,
except
in
so
far
as
i
said
congress
has
legislated
comprehensively
in
this
area
and
if
they
intend
--
mr.
george
e.
ashley
but
i
think
--
i
think
with
all
do
respect
that
if
they
felt
this
was
an
appropriate
power
of
the
court,
they
would
have
been
more
inclined
to
do
it
within
title
iii
where
there
was
the
basic
underlying
authority
spelled
out,
then
they
would
be
in
a
situation
where
that
was
not
the
case
and
congress
as
i
say
came
along
and
authorized
it
in
title
iii,
but
did
not
go
beyond
that
and
authorized
it
outside
of
title
iii
and
i
think
it
is
very
significant
that
when
congress
acted
in
this
respect
and
this
goes
back
to
the
point
that
you
mr.
chief
justice,
asked
me
just
before
the
luncheon
recess
that
the
congress
did
not
act
solely
with
respect
to
communication
is
common
carriers,
but
realized
that
the
problem
was
with
respect
to
the
right
to
require
affirmative
assistance
of
citizens
in
general
and
the
language
includes
custodians
of
property
and
other
citizens
than
communications
common
carriers.
they
were
all
dealt
with
indiscriminately
and
the
rights
and
responsibilities
where
no
distinction
was
made
between
the
communications
common
carriers
and
others.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
well,
we
would
not
do
it
under
the
title
iii
order.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
not
without
a
title
iii
order.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
toll
billing
records,
ordinary
business
records,
yes.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
but
there
was
a
precedent
of
the
pen
register
which
was
forbidden
prior
to
the
enactment
of
1968
and
which
was
found
that
a
telephone
company
should
not
turn
those
records
over
to
law
enforcement
agencies,
they
had
no
right
--
mr.
george
e.
ashley
well,
i
do
not
believe
there
is
any
authority
under
at
that
time
to
deal
with
it.
we
would
have
of
course
turnover
any
of
our
business
records.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
i
think
we
would
raise
the
question
as
to
the
possible
distinction
between
pen
register
information
and
--
and
ordinary
business
records
in
view
of
the
previous
state
of
the
law
and
the
question
as
to
whether
pen
--
title
iii
(voice
overlap)
mr.
george
e.
ashley
i
think
with
the
question
of
the
coverage
of
title
iii,
whether
pen
register
interception
is
included
within
the
scope
of
title
iii.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
we
would
raise
the
question
as
to
whether
we
should
respond
to
such
--
mr.
george
e.
ashley
we
would
produce
our
billing
records,
yes.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
we
would
certainly
raise
the
same
kind
of
question
we
have
raised
here
because
of
the
precedent
that
existed
before
the
enactment
of
the
title
iii
in
1968
and
raise
the
question
as
to
whether
that
did
not
carry
over
now.
there
was
a
distinction
made
between
pen
register
records
and
toll
billing
records
before
1968
and
i
think
if
pen
registers
are
covered
under
title
iii,
you
have
the
same
question
at
least
raised
as
to
whether
it
would
not
be
an
indirect
way
of
accomplishing
the
same
result.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
the
question
did
not
occur
to
me
before
you,
your
honor.
in
investigations
involving
whether
we
are
lawfully
carrying
out
our
duties,
i
suppose
under
proper
safeguards
of
confidentiality
and
impoundment
and
that
sort
of
thing,
yes,
they
would
be,
probably
would
--
mr.
george
e.
ashley
well,
to
limit
the
disclosure
only
to
this
federal
communications
commission
and
only
within
such
circumstances
as
were
necessary
for
it
to
carry
out
its
lawful
functions.
we
have
had
situations
like
that
with
respect
to
national
security
matters
and
all.
i
am
speculating
with
you,
but
i
think
the
--
the
question,
if
--
if
they
had
a
legitimate
investigation
going
as
to
whether
the
telephone
company
was
conducting
itself
properly
in
carrying
out
its
functions
under
the
act,
but
then
i
think
it
would
have
to
set
about
to
try
to
have
the
necessary
safeguards
to
prevent
disclosure
of
the
information
to
anyone
else,
but
probably
under
those
circumstances
it
could
be
done.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
well,
i
see
that
there
has
been
a
long
history
of
trying
to
limit
the
circumstances
under
which
the
law
enforcement
authorities
do
get
this
kind
of
information
and
there
had
been,
throughout
decades
before
this
was
unavailable
to
them
and
congress
in
enacting
title
iii
set
up
only
certain
limited
crimes
and
required
the
permission
to
be
secured
from
the
attorney
general
or
his
designated
assistant
in
order
to
centralize
the
extent
to
which
electronic
surveillance
was
available
to
the
law
enforcement
authorities
and
all
of
that
is
circumvented,
if
this
can
be
done
outside
the
scope
of
title
iii.
i
would
just
like
in
conclusion
to
call
the
attention
again
to
court
to
the
pictures
which
are
at
the
end
of
our
brief.
questions
were
asked
earlier
about
--
mr.
george
e.
ashley
well,
the
pen
register
and
the
modern
version
which
is
the
last
page
is
an
electronic
cabinet
about
this
wide
and
that
high,
with
the
--
mr.
george
e.
ashley
it
is
about
maybe
18
to
24
inches
long,
but
the
modern
version
has
all
of
these
nes
--
these
access
points
where
you
can
plug
in
whatever
circuits
or
whatever
function
you
wanted
in
a
phone.
mr.
george
e.
ashley
thank
you,
you
honor.
this
is
a
precedent
for
me
and
i
am
sorry
if
i
did
not
abide
by
the
rule.
