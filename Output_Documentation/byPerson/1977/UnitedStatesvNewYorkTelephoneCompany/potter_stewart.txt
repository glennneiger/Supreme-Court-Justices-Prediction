then
there
just
are
no
records,
however,
of
a
--
of
a
non-toll
local
calls
made
from
an
ordinary
telephone?
justice

stewart
that
may
show
the
number
of
calls,
but
does
not
show
the
numbers
called?
justice

my
experience
was
it
was
not
possible
to
get
those
in
response
to
a
subpoena?
justice
potter
stewart
and
your
argument
is,
that
this
as
i
thought,
the
inference
to
be
derived
from
your
argument
was
this
would
provide
a
known
--
more
information
and
could
have
been
secured
by
a
subpoena
and
if
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
well,
to
the
extent
they
are
and
that
is
the
whole
--
justice
potter
stewart
critical
if
in
--
in
your
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
gallo
case
it
might
follow
that
they
could?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
thought
the
gallo
case
held
otherwise?
justice
potter
stewart
judge
medina
for
the
court
of
appeals
took
even
a
narrower
review
i
guess,
did
he
not?
he
said
there
was
power,
but
that
it
was
an
abusive
of
discretion
exercise?
justice
potter
stewart
again,
normally
--
normally
a
subpoena
is
not,
is
to
require,
affirmatively
require
by
a
specific
affirmative
action,
the
active
cooperation
of
a
private
citizen
with
law
enforcement
agency?
justice

stewart
mr.
ashley,
our
rules
require
when
the
argument
portion
of
a
brief
exceeds
20
pages,
that
there
be
a
summary
of
argument
inserted.
i
do
not
think
that
rule
has
complied
that
here
and
i
do
suggest
that
you
do
it
the
next
time,
makes
it
a
little
easier
for
us.
