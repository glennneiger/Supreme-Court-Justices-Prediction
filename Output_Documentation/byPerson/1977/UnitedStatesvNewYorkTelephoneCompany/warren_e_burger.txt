we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
76-835,
united
states
against
new
york
telephone
company.
mr.
wallace,
you
may
precede
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
take
it
that
case
is
not
cited
in
your
brief
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
cited
(voice

chief

xerox
company.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
go
ahead
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
i
notice
that
rather
sweeping
concession
which
perhaps
the
telephone
company
might
not
be
happy
to
rely
on,
that
they
can
provide
this
technical
assistance
without
fear
of
civil
or
criminal
liability,
does
the
court
cite
any
authority
for
the
proposition?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
that
deal
a
civil
liability?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
wallace.
mr.
ashley.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
i
suppose,
as
a
utility
like
railroads
and
others
who
would
not
be
permitted
to
tolerate
free
service
to
some
customers?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
you
consistently
equate
the
telephone
company
with
the
private
citizen.
is
there
not
a
substantial
difference
between
the
telephone
or
the
private
individual
and
utility
which
has
received
this
monopoly
a
virtue
franchise
from
government?
is
not
there
a
difference
in
duties?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
over
the
years,
you
have
construed
that
duty
also
to
lead,
at
least
the
record
suggests,
a
good
deal
of
voluntary
cooperation
with
law
enforcement
officers?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
do
not
--
then
are
you
rejecting
the
idea
that
as
a
utility
having
a
monopoly
over
communications
that
you
have
a
higher
duty
than
the
ordinary
citizen?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
that
respect
your
--
as
mr.
justice
stewart
suggested
your
disagreeing
with
judge
medina's
view
that
there
is
authority,
but
that
it
was
an
abuse
of
the
discretion
or
exercise
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
at
1
oâ€™clock.[lunch
break]
mr.
ashley,
you
may
continue,
you
have
a
few
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you
are
now
--
you
suggested
a
precedent
this
morning.
you
do
it
for
your
own
--
in
the
execution
of
what
you
consider
your
own
notion
as
a
public
utility?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
would
not
want
to
call
that
a
selfish
interest
because
it
is
not
selfish,
you
--
you
got
to
collect
your
revenues,
but
you
do
it
for
your
own
purposes,
however,
appropriate
those
purposes
are?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
mr.
ashley
that
there
were
wide
spread
complaints
in
a
particular
area
that
pen
registers
were
being
abused
by
the
telephone
company
for
their
own
purposes
and
perhaps
for
purposes
unnecessary
involving
invasions
of
privacy.
could
the
federal
communications
commission
require
you
by
subpoena
or
other
process
to
produce
all
of
your
pen
registers
for
the
purposes
of
that
inquiry?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
confidentiality
for
what
purpose,
to
what
end?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
see
a
lack
of
safe
guards
in
the
present
situation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
thank
you,
mr.
ashley.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
wallace?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
can
require
them
to
furnish
a
key
to
get
in
the
room?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
thank
you,
gentleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
number
76-835
united
states
against
the
new
york
telephone
co.
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
white.
