justice
thurgood
marshall
could
that
be
an
embezzlement
that
would
not
be
under
this
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
of
money
because
money
travels
in
interstate
commerce?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
it
not
affect
the
interstate
commerce,
embezzlement
of
money?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
robbery
would?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
why
would
you
draw
a
line
between
robbery
and
embezzlement,
unless
they
stop
congress
in
passing
on
embezzlement?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
about
steeling
from
a
will?
can
you
steal
the
money?
i
am
just
wondering
what
is
left
to
the
state?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
it
is
conceded,
money
rules
in
interstate
commerce,
it
has
too?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
california
does
make
any
money?
they
do
not
mind
if
(inaudible),
do
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
the
money
in
california
has
moved
in
interstate
commerce.
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
is
covered
by
the
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
rob
money
in
the
state,
you
would
covered
by
the
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
says
robbery
in
any
way
or
degree
obstructs,
delays,
or
affects
commerce.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
so
if
you
rob
somebody
money,
you
could
at
least
affect
the
commerce?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
there
a
considerable
testimony
by
crossing
the
state
lines
turned
to
the
debates
on
the
hobbs
act?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
mr.
hoover
testify
on
that
reply?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
point
is
you
say
it
was
strictly
local
and
i
think
you
are
wrong?
i
think
they
were
right
about
crossing
state
line.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
confused.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
hewitt,
what
is
in
the
statute
that
where
a
criminal
has
to
go
to
the
legislative
history?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
hold
that
phrase?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
in
terrorem
effect?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
we
allowed
to
do
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
say
this
is
unconstitutional?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
why
do
we
have
to
do
this?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
your
observation
would
put
a
rather
severe
crimp
on
the
federal
kidnapping
statute,
would
they
not?
usually
you
do
not
have
chain
store
operations
with
kidnappings,
you
know
as
we
did
in
the
30s.
kidnapping
is
an
isolated
act,
as
this
you
can
see
it
was
an
isolated
act.
justice
thurgood
marshall
just
exactly
what
constitutional
right
will
deny
the
yokley?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
is
the
federal
statute
that
was
violated?
we
are
trying
to
find
out
what
is
the
complaint
here
is
that
we
can
get
to?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
know
you
have
a
complaint
but
(inaudible)
because
you
have
not
complained?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
i
want
to
know
something
that
we
can
address,
well,
i
mean
you
say
that
it
is
not
constitutional
so
it
must
be
statutory?
justice
thurgood
marshall
your
theory
is
that
by
some
provision
of
the
constitution,
you
read
into
a
statute
something
that
is
in
the
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
it
seems
to
me
it
applies
to
show
that
if
we
do
not
do
that,
your
client
has
at
some
constitutional
provision
violated.
if
not,
why
are
you
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
saying
it
seems
to
me
that
unless
we
go
with
you,
your
client
is
being
denied
of
constitutional
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
of
course
if
you
really
can't
be
tried
and
the
state
to
it
and
the
statute,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
has
been
indicted
in
the
state
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
how
long
would
the
statute
must
take
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
is
here
writ
of
certiorari
to
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
the
respondent
was
convicted
of
violating
the
hobbs
act.
the
evidence
at
the
trial
showed
that
he
and
an
accomplice
attempted
to
obtain
$100,000
from
a
federally
insured
bank
by
means
of
threats
of
physical
violence
made
to
the
bank's
president.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
respondent's
conviction
because
the
government
had
not
proved
that
respondent
was
guilty
of
“racketeering.”
the
court
held
that
proof
of
racketeering
was
a
necessary
ingredient
and
element
of
the
hobbs
act
offense.
by
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
hold
that
the
plain
language
of
the
hobbs
act
makes
clear
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
limit
that
statute's
scope
by
reference
to
an
undefined
category
of
conduct,
termed
racketeering.
moreover
the
legislative
history
evidences
a
congressional
intent
to
reach
all
conducts
within
the
express
terms
of
the
statute
and
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
accordingly
reversed.
mr.
justice
brennan
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
