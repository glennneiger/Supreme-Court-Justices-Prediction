mr.
james
f.
hewitt
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
suppose
if
(inaudible)
were
to
give
a
title
to
this
case
he
could
title
it,
“the
lamentable
loophole”
because
i
think
that
is
what
the
government
is
faced
with.
when
the
bank
robbery
act
which
came
as
the
result
of
the
anti-gangster
program
from
the
mid-30s,
it
was
considered
in
conjunction
with
the
“racketeering
act”
the
title
given
to
the
predecessor
of
the
hobbs
act.
the
ultimate
statute
that
came
out
of
the
1937
amendments,
involved
a
crime
of
bank
robbery
which
included
as
an
element,
intimidation,
the
essence
of
extortion.
it
required
that
this
intimidation
or
the
obtaining
of
the
money
to
be
from
the
person
or
presence
of
the
bank
officer
and
with
the
structure
at
that
time
with
the
bank
laws
in
this
statute,
there
was
this
gaping
hole.
unless
the
property
was
taken
from
the
person
or
presence
of
a
bank
officer,
it
was
not
a
federal
bank
robbery,
nor
would
it
be
a
loss
in
the
fb
taking
or
not
trespassory
in
nature.
so
we
were
left
with
one
novel
class
of
offence
that
was
uncovered,
extortion
not
from
the
person.
the
government’s
luck,
there
were
three
alternatives.
they
could
have
gone
to
congress
and
have
that
loophole
filled,
corrected
by
legislation.
they
could
find
another
statute
that
fits
or
they
could
leave
the
enforcement
to
the
states.
well,
the
government
has
chose
to
take
the
second
alternative
and
stretched
commerce
statute
that
was
aimed
at
racketeering
to
fill
the
loophole
and
by
doing
so
the
inevitable
consequence
is
a
blanket
intrusion
into
an
area
traditionally
enforced
by
the
states.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
i
think
the
working
definition
adopted
by
the
committee
pretty
well
expresses
what
“racketeering”
meant
in
the
30s
and
i
suppose
what
it
means
to
most
people
at
the
present
time,
an
organized
criminal
conspiracy,
perhaps
an
ongoing
criminal
conspiracy
not
certainly
an
isolated
event.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
as
the
statute
is
presently
written?
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
i
think
an
isolated
robbery
of
a
corner
liquor
store
is
a
violation
of
the
hobbs
act
if
we
give
it
the
interpretation
as
by
the
government.
the
yokley
case
was
a
stickup
of
the
kmart
department
store.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
yes.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
yes,
i
think
that
they
could
be
indicted
and
prosecuted
and
convicted
if
they
were
found
to
be
engaged
in
“racketeering”
and
i
see
no
reason
why
the
definition
could
not
be
the
definition
offered
by
the
copeland
committee
as
the
working
definition.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
even
though
it
does
not
appear
in
the
statute.
but
mr.
hewitt
you
considered
the
definition
of
felony
in
the
gerone
case,
the
word
felony
has
the
common
meaning
of
a
crime
involving
punishment
in
excess
of
the
year,
but
the
court
went
beyond
that
to
the
legislative
history
and
determined
that
it
only
pertain
to
felonies
affecting
national
banks.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
well...
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
i
think
it
is
the
obvious
breadth
of
the
statute.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
yes,
your
honor.
the
obvious...
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
i
think
the
court
must,
because
—
i
think
what’s
happened
is
that
the
evolution
of
the
interstate
commerce.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
no,
i
am
not
saying
that,
your
honor.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
because
i
think
it
is
the
duty
upon
this
court
to
make
sure
that
there
is
no
unwarranted
intrusion
or
incursion
into
traditional
state
police
power
matters.
now,
when
time...
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
this
court
made
the
suggestion
in
a
number
of
cases
—
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
just
the
tenth
amendment,
reserving
the
powers
to
the
states,
will
certainly
be
a
constitutional.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
well,
no
your
honor,
national
banks
is
a
different
problem
here.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
well,
we
have
a
national
bank,
but
we
do
not
have
a
national
bank
that
is
protected
by
the
national
banking
provisions.
we
have
a
national
bank
that
is
sought
to
be
protected
as
an
instrumentality
of
interstate
commerce
and
it
is
clear
that
is
not
what
congress
was
thinking
of
in
the
30s.
they
were
not
aiming
this
legislation
at
national
banks.
they
were
aiming
them
at
the
bank
robbery
act
at
national
banks.
this
was
aimed
at
interstate
commerce
as
it
was
known
in
1934
and
1937
and
we
know
that
in
that
era,
in
the
new
deal
era,
congress
was
very
sensitive
about
intruding
into
the
state’s
reserved
powers.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
i
think
that
was,
right,
there
was
certainly
recognition
and
discussion
on
it
of
whether
or
not
this
would
be
an
intrusion
in
the
vested
powers
of
the
states
and
the
resolution
i
think
was
made
that
this
is
an
area
where
the
federal
government
does
have
an
interest.
my
concern
here
is
that
what
has
happened
is
that
the
definition
of
interstate
commerce
has
evolved
with
the
operation
of
the
de
minimis
rule
to
cover
just
about
any
instrumentality,
including
the
corner
grocery
store.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
well,
i
bet
your
honor.
i
feel
safer
if
i
were
here
with
the
kmart
department
store
in
sixth
circuit.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
yes,
well
if
the
statute
itself
could
be
so
broadly
interpreted,
and
if
the
only
limitation
upon
its
application
where
there
is
a
threat
of
intrusion
and
upsetting
of
the
balance
of
federalism.
the
only
limitation
is
the
digression
of
the
prosecutor
that
he
is
not
going
to
push,
he
is
not
going
to
enforce
the
statute
as
broadly
as
it
is
read.
but
he
would
choose
to
limit
it
so
as
not
to
intrude
upon
the
vested
interest
of
the
states.
i
do
not
think
that
is
a
sufficient
protection
to
preserve
that
balance.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
well,
it
was
never
prosecuted
on
that
theory,
nor
was
it
—
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
well,
i
think
the
concept
of
“racketeering,”
if
were
to
give
it
the
meaning
of
the
congress
obviously
intended
in
the
30s,
must
be
an
ongoing
operation
more
than
an
isolated
transaction,
kind
of
an
organized
criminal
conspiracy
as
they
define
it.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
it
may
well
be,
it
may
well
be
that
if
these
were
evidence
of
the
series
of
bank
robberies
by
these
same
individuals,
we
might
have
some
organized
crime
or
racketeering
that
fits
with
that.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
well,
i
think
the
legislative
history
behind
the
kidnapping
act
has
certainly
pointed
that
the
isolated
transaction
rather
than
any
ongoing
enterprise.
and
certainly
congress
had
indicated,
in
enacting
the
kidnapping
statute
that
it
was
intruding
into
what
would
be
ordinarily
state
police
power,
but
it
may
specifically
find
that
because
of
the
mobility
of
the
kidnapper,
the
states
were
powerless
to
have
proper
—
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
yes
and
i
think
congress
could
be
very
well
similar
to,
in
the
loan
sharking
statute,
find
that
racketeering
has
such
an
effect
within
interstate
commerce
that
all
racketeering
maybe
punished
federally.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
oh!
this
case?
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
i
think
the
primary
federal
concern
here
is
incidental
only,
that
is,
that
it
was
a
national
bank
of
which
the
federal
government
has
primary
power
and
interest.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
the
congress
there
your
honor,
made
a
finding
that
loan
sharking
does
affect
commerce,
either
under
the
bankruptcy
clause
or
the
commerce
clause,
that
it
was
very
difficult
to
show
as
an
element
of
proof
of
connection
with
commerce
to
justify
jurisdiction.
therefore,
one
of
the
classes
of
activity
in
which
the
legislation
was
aimed
and
for
us
loan
sharking,
it
was
sufficient
to
show
that
the
person
was
a
member
of
that
class
and
nothing
more.
congress
could
have
done
the
same
thing
here,
but
they
did
not.
my
suggestion
is
that
the
legislative
history
indicates
very
clearly
that
congress
was
frankly
talking
about
labor
racketeering.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
i
do
not
think
we
can
your
honor,
i
think
the
predicate
was
laid
in
the
course
of
the
trial
that
most
banks,
in
effect
i
almost
say
all
banks,
have
a
sufficient
connection
upon
interstate
commerce,
sufficient
connection
with
it
under
the
depiction
of
assets
there
and
many
others.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
that
facet
does
not
bother
me,
i
agree
this
is
a
much
stronger
case
than
perez.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
constitutionally.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
no
sir,
i
am
certainly
not.
i
am
simply
saying
that
in
the
legislative
history
it
is
clear
that
congress
was
talking
in
hobbs
act
and
the
copeland
act
before
about
extortion
and
robbery
affecting
interstate
commerce.
during
the
same
legislation,
at
the
same
time
the
legislation
was
being
considered,
they
were
protecting
national
banks
with
the
bank
robbery
statute.
they
left
a
gaping
hole,
and
the
question
is
whether
that
hole
can
be
filled
without
doing
violence
to
the
considerations
of
federalism
and
we
suggest
that
it
can.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
well,
i
am
not
really
making
a
constitutional
argument
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
the
complaints
is,
and
as
the
court
below.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
i
have
certainly
do.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
well,
yes,
it
is
statutory.
he
was
convicted
of
the
statute
that
requires
showing
more
than
simply
an
act
affecting
commerce
under
the
de
minimis
theory.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
well,
i
think
that
i
am
asking
this
court
to
read
into
the
statue
a
limitation
that
will
prevent
the
statute
from
being
applied,
thereby
intruding
into
the
vested
police
power
of
the
states.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
no,
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
constitutional.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
well,
i
suppose
i
can
always
use
due
process
then
like
you
brought
it
up,
but
the
constitutional
right
would
be
to
be
tried
and
convicted
by
a
state
court
for
an
offence
against
the
state
that
is
not
a
federal
offence.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
your
honor
i
am
not
concerned
with
the
impact
on
commerce.
i
think
there
is
a
sufficient
impact
here
to
support
constitutional
jurisdiction.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
no,
that
is
not
my
argument
either?
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
that
is
right,
he
wants
to
be
convicted
for
a
legitimate
crime
rather
than
have
the
federal
law
twisted
around
to
inject
the
federal
government
into
an
area
where
they
do
not
belong,
unless
congress
has
specifically
indicated
we
wish
to
inject
federal
enforcement
into
this
narrow
area.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
no,
i
do
not
believe
it
has
your
honor
and
he
could
not
be
tried
by
the
state
only
because
california
has
a
penal
code
provision
that
prohibits
it.
if
he
were
prosecuted
in
the
state,
he
could
be
prosecuted
again
in
the
federal
government
or
in
the
state
in
which
no
provision
was
made.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
no.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
five
years,
your
honor.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
no,
and
for
this
reason
i
think
that
it
is
fairly
clear
that
congress
was
directing
the
mann
act
at
that
isolated
a
single.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
yes,
i
recall
that
case,
very
close
to
in
many
regards
to
this,
but...
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
i
can
recall
the
hypothetical
been
used
to
driving
across
the
fourteenth
street
bridge
with
evil
intent
would
violate
the
mann
act
at
that
time
because
congress
in
the
30s
was
very
sensitive
to
the
considerations
of
federalism.
the
justice
department
at
that
time,
statements
were
made
by
attorney
general
mitchell
and
later
by
attorney
general
cummings
that
they
were
concerned
with
the
fiscal
consequences
of
injecting
the
federal
government
into
the
states
of
assuming
too
much
responsibility,
fear
that
otherwise,
if
they
injected
themselves
too
greatly
into
state
law
enforcement
that
the
states
would
themselves
stop
beefing
up
their
police
and
stop
chasing
after
gangsters
of
the
gangster
era.
so
i
think
it
is
fairly
clear
that
the
racketeering
act
of
1934
was
aimed
at
the
primary
federal
interest
of
interstate
commerce.
but
certainly
a
secondary
interest
was
racketeering
and
having
defined
“racketeering”
as
an
organized
conspiracy
to
commit
extortion,
we
suggest
that
the
court
could
turn
to
that
definition
as
the
definition
that
congress
obviously
was
using
when
it
was
considering
those
legislations.
as
suggested
before
in
this
court
in
gerone,
looked
at
the
legislative
history
to
define
felony
as
that
term
which
used
in
gerone.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
it
certainly
has
and
i
would
have
to
concede
if
congress
were
to
consider
this
bill
today,
congress
would
probably
find
that
its
advantages
to
assume
this
role
and
this
responsibility
in
the
states
and
i
am
sure
that
they
would
enact
a
statute
as
broad
as
this
if
not
broader
if
possible.
but
i
do
not
think
that
we
can
consider
what
their
intent
might
be
today
under
similar
circumstances.
i
think
the
question
is,
what
the
intent
of
congress
was
in
1934
and
1937,
and
later
in
1946
when
the
hobbs
act
amended
the
antiracketeering
act,
and
i
submit
that
there
is
no
indication.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
and
i
think
this
reflected
in
the
outgrowth
of
the
30s
legislation
to
have
the
mobility
and
the
change
in
the
world
and
like
i
say
i
think
congress
could
now
do
this
if
it
made
that
decision
that
it
is
going
to
enact
legislation
—
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
no,
i
do
not
think
in
this
particular
statute
they
did.
i
think
in
some
areas
it
was
debated,
resolved
that
they
would.
a
racketeering
and
gangster
activities
were
such
that
the
federal
government
had
to
protect
federal
banks,
therefore
the
bank
robbery
act
came
out.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
briefs
there
were
25
or
30
pieces
of
legislation
that
grew
out
of
that
crime
package.
the
only
one
called
a
racketeering
act
was
this
particular
statute.
the
refill
was
aimed
at
racketeering.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
pardon?
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
congress
called
it.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
yes,
that
was
the
title
of
this
particular
bill.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
the
racketeering
act.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
the
title?
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
within
the
statute,
no,
of
course
they
did
not
use
the
term
there.
perhaps
congress
assumed
that
everyone
would
now
they
were
talking
about
racketeering.
i
concede
as
the
government
points
out
that
when
they
passed
the
recent
crime
bill
they
defined
“racketeering”
specifically.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
they
certainly
could
have
your
honor,
if
they
felt
that
—
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
well
in
40
years,
i
suppose
congress
realized
that
they
may
have
to
define
terms
more
specifically
then
they
did
in
the
mid-30s.
at
that
time
they
thought
that
probably
there
be
no
encouragement
upon
state
police
powers
since
at
that
time
a
direct
effect
to
put
into
interstate
commerce
was
required.
they
were
speaking
in
terms
of
the
poultry
racket
and
the
shake
downs
that
gave
rise
to
court’s
decision
of
local
807.
they
were
not
thinking
that
interstate
commerce
would
mean
upon
a
grocery
store
or
a
small
business
with
just
a
de

affect
on
commerce.
and
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
any
suggestion
in
the
legislative
history
that
congress
dreamed
that
this
extortion
act
aimed
at
labor
racketeering
would
ever
be
use
to
fill
the
loophole
in
the
bank
robbery
statute
and
i
think
that
is
precisely
what
has
been
done
here.
i
do
not
think
that
relying
upon
the
justice
department
to
limit
itself
will
solve
the
problem.
i
think
that
the
court
has
to
find
whether
or
not
if
this
statute
being
broadly
applied
would
be
an
intrusion
into
state
sovereignty.
i
think
the
court
should
give
it
a
restrictive
blast
and
prevent
any
upsetting
of
that
delicate
balance.
no
further
questions,
thank
you
your
honor.
