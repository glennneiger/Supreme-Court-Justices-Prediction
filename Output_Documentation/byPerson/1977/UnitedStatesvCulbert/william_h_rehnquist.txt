justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
do
you
say
you
would
not
be
surprised
to
see
such
a
pattern
in
the
seventh
circuit?
[laughter]
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
hobbs
act
does
not
preempt
state
law,
does
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
beale,
you
said
that
many
rackets
are
of
purely
local
interest.
what
did
you
mean
by
the
term
“rackets?”
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
it
was
aimed
at
racketeering
mr.
hewitt,
what
do
you
mean
by
“racketeering”?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
anyone
could
be
punished
under
this
statute
then?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
are
saying
neither
of
those
can
be
punished
under
the
statute,
are
you
not?
you
agree
with
the
yokley?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
i
am
asking
you
is
if
you
take
yokley
as
the
law
and
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit,
in
this
case
as
the
law.
do
you
think
anyone
can
be
validly
indicted
under
this
particular
section
in
view
of
that
if
you
have
to
read
in
the
“racketeering”
qualifications
which
to
me
is
rather
a
morpheus?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
it
does
not
appear
in
the
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
about
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
which
was
passed
in
1938,
would
you
say
that
was
an
example
of
congressional
sensitivity?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
have
a
quote
here
mr.
hewitt,
with
a
constitutional
basis
for
this
particular
prosecution
that
there
was
an
insufficient
basis
for
connecting
this
particular
extortion
with
the
movement
of
goods
in
interstate
commerce?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to
me
this
is
a
better
case
for
the
government
than
perez,
which
i
think
frankly
had
i
been
on
the
court
i
would
have
regarded
it
as
quite
doubtful
in
spite
of
the
blanket
congressional
findings,
but
here
it
seems
to
me
you
have
factual
findings
by
a
trier
effect?
