chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
united
states
v.
culbert.
mrs.
beale
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
say
there
is
no
dispute
except
that
the
court
did
not
seem
to
follow
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
mentioned
166
cases
in
a
year
and
in
addition
you
have
94
united
states
attorneyâ€™s
offices
and
the
police
senior
the
monitoring,
perhaps
i
should
say
the
monitoring
of
the
day-to-day
decisions
is
not
a
simple
task
i
suppose?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
statutory
authority
and
the
motives
of
the
united
states
attorney
dispositive
or
even
very
important?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
good,
this
might
be
a
good
time
to
remind
us
that
justice
frankfurt
once
said
that
when
the
legislative
history
is
ambiguous
and
confused
to
turn
to
the
clear
language
of
the
statute.
i
do
not
remember
the
name
of
the
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
hewitt.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
do
we
find
that
limitation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
do
we
find
it,
in
the
constitution
somewhere?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
think
the
protection
of
national
banks
was
reserved
exclusively
to
the
states
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
not
what
we
have
got
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
we
need
to
worry
about
the
corner
grocery
store
in
a
case
where
we
are
dealing
with
a
national
bank?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
the
corner
liquor
store?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
the
amount
extorted
or
sum
to
be
extorted
was
enough
to
render
the
national
bank
insolvent,
would
you
think
then
if
the
demand
had
been
that
large
you
would
have
a
real
impact
on
intestate
commerce?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
then
if
there
is
a
sufficient
impact,
does
not
that
would
be
a
federal
concern
and
what
seems
to
be
the
fulcrum
of
your
argument
that
there
is
not
sufficient
federal
concern
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
the
person
wanted
to
be
convicted
by
a
state
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
hewitt.
do
you
have
anything
further
mrs.
beale?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
counsel,
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinions
of
the
court
in
united
states
against
culbert
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
marshall.
chief
justice
warren

burger

you,
mr.
justice
marshall.
