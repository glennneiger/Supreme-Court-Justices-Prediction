unknown
speaker
i
take
it
the
theory
your
case
is
you
do
not
need
to
look
at
the
legislative
history
at
all?
unknown
speaker
mrs.
beale,
has
the
government
utilized
the
act
to
in
cases
such
as
this
only
recently?
unknown
speaker
has
they
believe
it
has
been
restricted
to
the
way
across
the
state
line?
unknown
speaker
ms.
beale,
you
have
mentioned
as
the
department
limits
its
prosecution
in
the
case
where
there
is
a
substantial
federal
concern.
you
have
cited
the
states
act
case
in
your
brief
if
you
remember,
what
was
the
substantial
federal
concern
there?
unknown
speaker
because
it
is
a
zoning
bribery
case,
would
it
not,
local
zoning?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
the
substantial
federal
concern
is
that
the
state
is
not
doing
a
good
job
of
enforcing
its
own
laws?
unknown
speaker
there
was
not
really
a
terrible
interference
with
interstate
commerce
in
that
case,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
is
it
not
true
that
the
statutes
frequently
have
been
used,
at
least
in
the
seventh
circuit,
to
prosecute
political-type
crimes
where
the
local
law
enforcement
authorities
were
not
enforcing
the
local
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
moving
forward
--
unknown
speaker
the
bank
here,
if
i
may
interrupt,
was
a
national
bank,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
the
bank
that
was
the
subject
of
this
extortion
was
a
national
bank?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it
had
been
a
state
bank
and
not
insured
under
the
fdic,
would
that
admit
it?
unknown
speaker
the
proof
in
this
case
showed
interstate
commerce?
unknown
speaker
well,
ms.
beale,
the
literal
language
of
the
act
i
suppose,
would
you
not
agree
would
color
robbery
of
goods
from
a
department
store
that
were
destined
to
move
and
had
moved
in
interstate
commerce
and
were
destined
to
be
sold
to
customers
of
the
store?
unknown
speaker
and
would
it
not
apply
to
that
case?
unknown
speaker
would
it
also
apply
to
(inaudible)
in
the
home
that
has
been
shifted
interstate
commerce?
unknown
speaker
what
if
it
is
robbery?
if
it
is
robbery,
it
has
to
be
robbery
or
extortion?
unknown
speaker
affecting
commerce?
unknown
speaker
ms.
beale,
i
would
like
to
get
back
to
this
question
i
have
been
trying
to
get
a
word
and
advice
on
here?
the
court
does
not
relied
on
the
yokley
case,
did
not
it?
unknown
speaker
and
this
was
a
robbery
of
a
kmart
store?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
is
a
different
kind
of
a
case?
unknown
speaker
then
let
me
ask
you
an
unfair
question?
why
did
not
the
solicitor
general
of
sixth
circuit
in
yokley?
unknown
speaker
because
he
was
a
circuit
judge
at
that
point.
unknown
speaker
which
is
wrong?
unknown
speaker
well
it
was
not
the
same
thing
true
about
the
loan
sharking
statute
that
you
have
sustained
two
or
three
years
ago?
unknown
speaker
is
this
further
away
from
federal
concern
than
loan
sharking?
unknown
speaker
this
case?
unknown
speaker
yes,
this
case,
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
whereas
in
the
loan
sharking
case
you
did
not
have
any
national
aspect
expect
that
it
had
some,
as
the
dissenters
thought,
some
very
remote
effect
and
impact
on
interstate
commerce.
unknown
speaker
constitutionally?
unknown
speaker
but
you
are
not
making
a
constitutional
claim?
unknown
speaker
are
you
familiar
with
the
caminetti
case,
mr.
hewitt?
back
in
good
many
years
ago
in
1917,
involving
the
mann
act,
where
the
legislative
history
of
the
mann
act
was
very
clear
that
it
was
directed
at
the
so
called
white
slave
traffic,
that
where
the
literal
terms
of
the
statute
covered,
casual,
fully
non-commercial
episode
between
missouri
and
kansas
city,
missouri
and
kansas
city,
kansas
i
think
and
the
conviction
was
affirmed
here.
unknown
speaker
is
it
not
the
argument
you
are
making
is
precisely
the
kind
of
argument
that
was
rejected
in
that
case?
unknown
speaker
no,
what
was
clear
that
congress
was
directing
it
at
commercialized
advice,
an
interstate
transportation
so
called
white
slaves.
that
was
the,
legislative
history
was
crystal
clear,
but
the
literal
terms
of
the
statute
covered
this
single,
casual,
non-commercial
episode
and
this
court,
in
the
opinion
by
mr.
justice
day,
i
think
he
was
affirmed
the
conviction.
unknown
speaker
maybe
we
are
now
in
a
different
era?
that
case,
that
decision
had
been
greatly
criticized
actually.
unknown
speaker
but
if
as
long
as
the
goal
as
mr.
justice
day’s
opinion,
it
was
thought
by
the
congress
and
accepted
by
the
court.
this
was
not
an
undue
intrusion
into
state’s
police
power,
has
not
the
world
become
more
complex
and
travel
much
swifter
and
all
other
things
going
opposite
from
the
direction
that
you
argue?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
was
speaking
of
the
lapse
of
time
between
mr.
day’s
opinion
and
the
late
30s?
that
was
the
movement
of
all
the
legislation
at
that
time,
and
suddenly
the
country
discovered
that
automobiles
and
airplanes
and
a
lot
of
other
things
had
come
on
the
scene
and
changed
the
whole
pattern
of
criminal
activity,
especially
if
people
could
commit
crimes
near
state
borders
and
then
slip
across
the
next
border.
unknown
speaker
while
they
made
that
decision,
did
they
not
make
that
decision
in
the
30s?
unknown
speaker
who
calls
it
that?
unknown
speaker
who
calls
it
that?
unknown
speaker
in
the
legislation
itself?
unknown
speaker
in
the
language
of
the
statute
that.
unknown
speaker
no,
in
the
language
of
the
particular
statute
we
are
applying
here?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
am
talking
about
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
they
could
have
done
all
of
that
with
this
bill?
unknown
speaker
and
they
did
not?
we
spoke
with
not
what
they
could
have
done,
but
with
what
they
did
do.
