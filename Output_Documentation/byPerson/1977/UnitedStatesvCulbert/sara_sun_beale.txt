ms.
sara

beale
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
before
this
court
on
the
government’s
petition
for
review
of
a
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
holding
that
although
respondent’s
conduct
in
this
case
falls
within
the
language
of
the
hobbs
act,
18
u.
s.
c.
section
1951.
it
was
nonetheless
not
within
the
reach
of
that
act
because
it
did
not
also
constitute
racketeering.
accordingly
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
respondent’s
conduct
fell
within
the
exclusive
criminal
jurisdiction
of
the
state
of
california.
let
me
reiterate
at
the
outset
that
there
is
no
dispute
that
respondent’s
conduct
fell
within
the
express
terms
of
the
act
which
reaches
the
conduct
of
whoever
in
any
way
or
in
any
degree
obstructs
delays
or
affects
commerce
by
either
robbery
or
extortion
or
who
attempts
or
conspires
to
do
so.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well,
there
is
no
dispute
that
it
falls
within
that
language.
the
question
is
whether
the
act
should
be
construed
to
have
an
additional
limitation
to
racketeering,
but
it
falls
within
the
express
terms.
the
evidence
showed
that
in
april
of
1975,
respondent
and
his
accomplice
attempted
to
extort
a
$100,000
from
the
federally
insured
bank
that
was
doing
business
in
interstate
commerce.
respondent’s
accomplice
telephoned
the
bank’s
president
and
threatened
to
detonate
remote-controlled
bombs
at
both
the
bank
and
the
home
of
the
bank
president
unless
certain
instructions
were
followed.
the
bank
president
then
took
a
package
of
false
currency
that
has
been
supplied
by
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
and
left
it
at
the
spot
that
has
been
designated
by
respondent’s
accomplice.
the
respondent
and
his
accomplice
never
picked
up
this
package
because
it
was
found
almost
immediately
by
two
small
children
who
opened
it
and
tore
apart
the
packages
of
false
currency.
following
a
jury
trial
in
the
northern
district
of
california,
respondent
was
convicted
of
both
the
violation
of
the
hobbs
act
and
also
of
attempted
bank
robbery.
although
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
both
of
these
two
convictions,
the
government
seeks
review
in
this
court
only
of
its
ruling
regarding
respondent’s
conviction
under
the
hobbs
act.
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
relying
upon
an
earlier
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit
that
conduct
such
as
respondent’s,
which
was
prescribed
by
the
express
terms
of
the
hobbs
act
must
also
be
proven
to
constitute
racketeering
in
order
to
be
within
the
reach
of
that
act.
the
court
rested
this
construction
on
the
act
on
two
distinct
grounds;
first
on
its
reading
of
congressional
intent
and
second
on
its
view
of
the
considerations
of
federalism.
the
court
did
not
in
its
opinion
defined
the
term
“racketeering”
and
that
is
the
point
to
which
i
will
return
later
in
my
argument.
it
did
however
conclude
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
“racketeering”
in
the
present
case.
judge
carter
dissented
from
the
reversal
of
the
conviction
under
the
hobbs
act.
i
want
to
stress
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
suggest
and
respondent
does
not
contend
that
congress
lacked
the
constitutional
authority
to
prohibit
all
of
the
conducts
which
does
fall
within
the
express
terms
of
the
hobbs
act.
the
breadth
of
congress’
power
under
the
interstate
commerce
clause
is
firmly
established
and
it
is
in
no
way
a
questioned
here.
the
court
of
appeals
simply
concluded
that
considerations
of
federalism
militated
against
any
conclusion
that
congress
had
intended,
what
that
court
viewed
as
a
major
incursion
into
areas
of
state
concern
and
as
a
result
that
court
adopted
the
limiting
construction
of
the
act
which
is
at
issue
here.
the
language
of
the
act
itself,
which
is
of
course
the
primary
guide
to
its
meaning,
contains
no
support
for
this
construction.
the
act
does
not
define
nor
does
it
even
mention
the
term
“racketeering”
nor
does
it
contain
any
qualifying
words
that
might
be
thought
to
exempt
conduct
which
may
not
amount
to
racketeering.
instead,
the
act
is
broadly
drafted
to
reach
anyone,
who
in
anyway
or
degree
obstructs
or
effects
commerce
by
either
robbery
or
extortion.
accordingly,
the
high
of
this
case
is
respondent’s
contention
that
the
sweeping
language
which
congress
employed
requires
the
limiting
construction
of
the
act
in
order
to
prevent
a
wholesale
invasion
of
the
criminal
jurisdiction
of
the
states,
a
result
which
respondent
contends
was
not
within
the
intention
of
congress.
i
would
like
to
turn
first
to
the
question
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
act.
i
will
not
attempt
here
to
review
in
great
detail
the
various
congressional
committee
reports
that
were
issued
in
connection
with
both
the
hobbs
act
and
its
immediate
predecessor
the
act
of
june
18,
1934,
nor
will
i
try
and
review
in
detail
the
debates.
these
matters
are
discussed
at
length
in
our
brief.
i
do
want
to
make
two
principal
points
in
connection
—
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well,
i
think
that
the
language
of
the
act
is
very
plain,
but
when
one
looks
at
the
legislative
history
one
finds
nothing
that
supports
the
conclusion
that
is
really
at
variance
with
that
plain
and
very
broad
language.
my
first
point
in
connection
with
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
is
that
although
it
was
an
outgrowth
of
congressional
concern
with
so
called
“racketeering”
that
in
no
way
indicates
that
congress
intended
some
unstated
limitation
which
appears
neither
in
the
act
itself
nor
in
the
committee
reports
to
some
concept
of
racketeering
whatever
that
maybe.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
i
think
there
has
been
no
substantial
change
in
the
enforcement
of
the
hobbs
act
in
some
30
years
since
it
was
enacted.
it
has
received
no
new
construction
and
i
am
not
aware
of
any
substantial
change.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well,
there
are
simple
policies
that
are
currently
used
by
the
department
to
determine
what
are
appropriate
areas
or
appropriate
kinds
of
cases
in
which
hobbs
act
should
be
enforced
and
they
differ
according
to
whether
robbery
or
extortion
is
at
issue.
the
department
at
present
and
i
am
not
certain
when
this
policy
was
first
promulgated,
it
is
not
of
particularly
recent
origin,
but
in
robbery
cases,
the
department
as
a
matter
of
policy
restricts
prosecution
in
most
instances
to
cases
where
there
is
either
a
showing
of
organized
crime
involvement
or
an
extensive
scheme
of
some
sort.
now,
in
practice
there
is
also
an
attempt
to
limit
other
kinds
of
cases
to
areas
where
there
is
what
is
thought
to
be
a
substantial
federal
concern
and
a
point
that
i
want
to
discuss
shortly
is
that
concerns
really
the
reality
of
the
concern
with
the
invasion
of
state
interests
and
a
point
that
i
was
going
to
mention
is
that
there
were
only
166
nationwide
indictments
under
the
hobbs
act
in
1976
and
that
perhaps
will
give
some
kind
of
an
idea
of
what
the
enforcement
pattern
currently
is.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well,
the
states
act
case
was
a
prosecution
under
color
of
official
right,
portion
of
the
act.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
right,
i
think
one
of
that
considerations
is
of
course
and
a
theme
that
recurs
in
legislative
history
of
the
act
is
a
real
concern
for
offenses
which
(a)
affects
commerce
and
(b)
where
the
states
have
not
acted
on
those
prosecuting
offences.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well,
i
think
that
where
interstate
commerce
has
interfered
by
means
of
extortion
where
color
of
official
right
is
involved,
that
is
an
area,
particularly
were
the
concern
that
congress
expressed
whether
that
the
states
were
not
acting
is
being
initiative.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
and
then
that
neary
hospital
was
never
built.
i
would
not
disagree
that
states
act
maybe
a
case
that
is
on
the
fringes
and
that
there
may
not
among
a
166
prosecutions
in
a
year
be
some
which
are
not
on
the
edge
of
the
commerce.
such
as
the
present
case
accruing
in
the
main
—
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well,
i
guess
i
am
not
prepared
to
discuss
particularly
the
seventh
circuit
enforcement.
i
do
think
that
it
is
clear
that
the
act
itself
contains
this
specific
provision
dealing
with
extortion
under
color
of
official
right
and
that
that
fits
quite
comfortably
with
the
concern
in
the
legislative
history
and
that
where
there
are
crimes
affecting
interstate
commerce,
and
particularly
where
the
states
do
not
act,
and
that
is
very
likely
to
happen
in
cases
of
official
corruption,
that
that
would
be
appropriate
area
of
federal
concern.
so
i
would
not
be
surprised
to
see
a
pattern
such
as
that
in
the
seventh
circuit.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
i
am
not
sure
i
intended
quite,
that
was
only
in
response
to
the
earlier
question.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
oh!
i
think
that
is
quite
right
but
there
is
and
this
is
the
only
point
and
we
raised
this
in
our
brief
to
suggest
that
there
is
an
effort
to
try
and
exert
some
control
on
the
part
of
the
department,
which
is
i
think
wholly
consistent
when
the
act
is
very
broadly
drafted
and
this
merely
in
response
to
the
question
of
how
is
the
act
enforced.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
pardon
me?
ms.
sara
sun
beale
that
is
quite
right,
it
was
a
federally-insured
bank
and
there
was
also
evidence
of
its
doing
business
in
interstate
commerce
and
i
think
that
is
not
at
all
any
—
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well,
i
think
that
it
seems
to
me
at
least
and
we
have
argued
in
our
brief,
that
the
banking
industry
is
one
which
really
has
occupies
a
special
position
in
interstate
commerce
and
it
serves
as
one
of
the
channels
of
interstate
commerce
and
i
think
a
prosecution
for
extortion
of
a
state
bank
would
not
be
an
inappropriate
exercise
of
federal
power
and
i
think
it
could
be
shown
to
have
an
effect
probably
on
interstate
commerce
in
a
given
case.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
that
is
correct.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
no,
i
think
that
they
are
not
dispositive
and
as
i
say
this
was
raised
only
in
connection
with
trying
to
quantify
what
is
the
practice
under
the
act,
how
many
prosecutions
are
there
because
that
goes
to
the
issues
suggested
by
respondents
and
the
concern
raised
by
the
court
of
appeals
as
to
whether
the
broad
language
of
this
act
has
resulted
or
will
result
in
some
widespread
incursion
into
areas
of
traditional
state
concern.
i
think
it
is
only
relevant
for
that
reason
because
of
the
concern
expressed
below.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well,
i
think
an
effect
on
interstate
commerce
could
be
shown
and
it
is
clear
that
the
act
applies
where
in
fact...
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well,
i
think
--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
i
think
we
may
be
getting
near
the
fringes
here.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
affecting.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
right.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
that
is
exactly
right.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
that
is
correct.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well,
i
see
no
reason
for
distinguishing
either
in
terms
of
the
legislative
intent
or
the
considerations
of
federalism
as
to
whether
some
kind
of
additional
concept
not
stated
in
the
act,
should
be
applied
or
construed
into
the
act.
the
legislative
history
makes
it
quite
clear
that
at
the
time
the
hobbs
act
was
enacted
those
who
opposed
the
act
argued
that
every
state
had
laws
covering
both
extortion
and
robbery
and
they
argued
that
this
act
should
not
be
passed
because
it
would
be
a
wholly
unwanted
incursion
into
these
areas
of
state
concern
that
the
state
had
laws.
the
proponents
of
the
bill
did
not
in
any
way
disagree
with
that.
they
said
yes
this
is
an
area,
every
state
has
laws
regarding
extortion
and
regarding
robbery,
but
in
so
far
as
it
affects
interstate
commerce,
these
laws
have
not
been
enforced.
in
many
instances
there
is
a
burden
and
effect
on
interstate
commerce
and
hobbs
act
must
be
passed
in
order
to
protect
the
flow
interstate
commerce.
that
is
the
argument
that
carried
the
day.
no
distinction
was
drawn
either
in
the
legislative
history
or
in
these
debates
as
to
either
robbery
or
extortion.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
i
really
cannot
answer
that
question.
i
think
at
that
point
--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
in
fact
the
case
i
saw
--
[laughter]
ms.
sara
sun
beale
an
embezzlement?
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well,
i
would
not
think
considering
the
[voice
overlap]
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well,
the
act
is
limited
to
robbery
and
extortion
affecting
interstate
commerce
and
i
would
not
think
that
normal
case
of
embezzlement
would
fall
in
the
definition
of
the
act.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well,
because
robbery
is
specifically.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
i
see
no
constitutional
impediment
against
congress
passing
such
a
law.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
i
am
not
certain
what
affect
there
would
be
on
interstate
commerce
that
could
be
relied
upon
by
congress
in
the
case
of
stealing
from
a
will.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well,
that
is
a
very
broad
statement,
whether
that
would
support
the
exercise
of.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
it
certainly
should
not
be.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
that
is
correct.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
i
am
not
sure
that
i...
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well,
it
is
not
clear
that
merely
because
some
article
has
that
one
time
passed
interstate
commerce
at
will
that
that
would
provide
sufficient
basis
for
congress.
the
congress
really
want
to
one
would
have
the
power
to
would
be
able
to
make
findings
that
any
robbery
affected
interstate.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
right,
that
is
correct.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well,
an
artful
counsel
might
be
able
to
make
that
argument.
i
suspect
that
jury
would
not
find
that
there
had
really
been
an
effect
on
interstate
commerce,
if
i
rob
someone
a
$5.00
on
the
corner.
in
anyway,
i
do
want
to
make
a
few
additional
points.
one
is
that
the
legislative
history
clearly
indicates
that
there
was
no
settled
meaning
for
the
term
“racketeering”
although
congress
was
concerned
in
1934
and
in
1946
with
a
variety
of
problems
that
were
described
as
“racketeering.
that
term
had
no
distinct
meaning.
the
committee
which
was
investigating
the
problem
of
racketeering
found
it
necessary
to
adopt
a
working
definition
to
guide
its
investigation
and
it
stated
that
it
was
necessary
to
adopt
such
a
definition
because
the
term
“racketeering”
was
being
used
to
refer
to
activities
that
were
not
even
criminal,
to
activities
that
were
immoral,
to
activities
that
were
fraudulent,
to
wide
varieties.
another
point
that
it
seems
inconceivable
in
that
regard
that
a
committee
that
was
so
aware
of
the
vagueness
of
the
definition
of
the
term
“racketeering”,
would
nevertheless
have
intended
to
make
that
a
part
of
a
federal
criminal
statute
without
mentioning
it
in
the
act,
without
defining
it,
without
making
it
as
clear
in
the
committee
reports.
another
point
regarding
the
legislative
history
of
the
act,
is
that
there
is
a
suggestion
both
in
respondent’s
brief
and
by
the
court
below
that
because
the
originating
committee
was
concerned
with
racketeering
and
because
there
are
various
expressions
of
support
for
the
bill
as
an
anti-racketeering
measure,
the
bill
should
be
construed
as
limited
to
this
one
kind
of
problem
only
to
racketeering.
if
that
were
true,
it
seems
to
me
that
all
the
ninety
some
bills
that
were
proposed
by
the
same
committee
at
the
close
of
its
investigation
on
racketeering,
which
range
from
kidnapping
to
munity
in
federal
prisons,
to
interstate
transportation
of
stolen
property,
that
all
of
those
would
likewise
have
to
be
limited
to
racketeering.
and
it
seems
to
be
that
it
is
simply
not
reasonable
to
construe
all
the
committee’s
work
as
limited
to
racketeering,
when
it
never
expressed
the
desire
that
that
should
be
done
and
when
this
was
not
made
an
element
of
that
particular
statute.
i
have
already
mentioned
the
fact
that
the
debates
on
the
hobbs
act
make
very
clear
the
fact
that
congress
was
well
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
crimes
being
defined
in
the
hobbs
act
were
crimes
which
are
already
punishable
under
state
law
and
in
deed
it
was
recognized
that
the
definitions
which
appear
in
the
hobbs
act
were
derived
and
were
taken
directly
from
the
new
york
penal
code.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
no,
that
is
exactly
right.
no
one
has
ever
suggested
that
merely
because
the
congress
found
it
desirable
and
necessary
to
define
the
theory
to
allow
federal
prosecutions
that
had
intended
that
the
state
should
not
be
allowed
to
prosecute
robbery
and
extortion
and
indeed
they
do
so
today.
i
think
it
is
time
to
turn
from
the
legislative
history
to
the
considerations
of
federalism,
which
really
underlay
the
court’s
reading
on
the
legislative
history.
the
first
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
is
one
which
i
touch
on
somewhat
earlier.
the
court
of
appeals
suggested
that
the
limiting
construction,
which
it
applied
to
the
act
was
essential
in
order
to
prevent
a
really
wide
scale
invasion
and
incursion
on
to
the
criminal
jurisdiction
of
the
states.
just
mentioning
response
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist’s
question
that
the
act
has
never
been
interpreted
nor
was
in
intended
to
preempt
the
state.
in
addition
as
i
noted
earlier,
there
has
been
no
wide
scale
incursion
into
areas
causing
a
general
problem.
there
were
166
prosecutions
nationwide
in
1976.
again,
turning
to
this
particular
prosecution,
we
think
it
is
a
good
example
of
one
where
there
is
a
strong
federal
interest
involved.
the
federal
government
(inaudible)
has
a
compelling
interest
in
prosecuting
under
its
own
laws
an
attempted
extortion
from
a
bank
that
it
ensures
that
serves
businesses
in
many
states
and
that
is
part
of
an
industry
that
perhaps
more
than
any
other
facilitates
the
flow
of
interstate
commerce.
in
any
event,
even
assuming
that
there
are
factual
situations
that
fall
within
the
literal
language
of
the
hobbs
act,
but
in
which
there
is
no
substantial
federal
interest,
requiring
proof
of
“racketeering”
would
in
no
way
serve
to
screen
out
those
cases
in
which
there
is
a
minimal
federal
interest.
although
the
court
of
appeals
provided
no
definition
of
“racketeering.”
it
seems
clear
that
there
is
nothing
inherent
in
their
concept
which
suggests
that
racketeers
prey
only
on
businesses,
on
persons
who
are
heavily
involved
in
interstate
commerce.
indeed
the
respondent’s
brief
indicates
and
cites
a
good
portion
of
the
legislative
history
to
show
that
many
rackets
are
of
essentially
local
character.
therefore,
limiting
the
act
to
“racketeering”
seems
to
have
very
little
to
do
with
a
legitimate
concern
for
state
sovereignty.
indeed
the
fact
that
the
prosecution
we
have
at
issue
here
falls
out
five
scope
of
the
act,
as
it
was
defined
by
the
court
of
appeals,
despite
the
vital
federal
interest,
demonstrates
the
fallacy
of
assuming
that
limiting
the
act
to
“racketeering”
will
somehow
serves
the
purpose
of
screening
out
these
cases
which
are
less
directly
related
to
the
federal
interest.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
i
was
referring
to
the
portions
of
a
legislative
history
that
are
particularly
cited
and
emphasized
in
respondent’s
brief.
there
are
many
problems
in
the
legislative
history
which
are
so
called
“rackets”
or
“racketeering,”
many
definitions,
but
some
of
those
with
which
congress
was
clearly
concerned,
as
shown
by
the
legislative
history
seem
to
be
of
an
essentially
local
nature.
and
it
seems
clear
that
congress
took
the
working
definition
of
the
committee
in
1934
and
adopted
that
definition
in
the
1934
act
to
make
it
suitable
for
use
in
a
federal
criminal
statute
and
changed
the
definition
in
two
primary
ways.
the
working
definition
was
as
an
organized
conspiracy
to
commit
either
robbery
or
coercion.
the
committee
added
to
that
definition
in
the
1934
act,
the
requirement
that
there
be
an
effect
on
interstate
commerce
and
they
deleted
the
requirement
that
there
be
an
organized
conspiracy.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
there
certainly
were
expressions
of
—
ms.
sara
sun
beale
i
am
not
entirely
sure?
ms.
sara
sun
beale
i
think
i
perhaps
i
have
confused
two
separate
points.
one
is
that
some...
ms.
sara
sun
beale
no,
one
is
that
some
things
that
were
described
in
the
legislative
history
as
“rackets”
were
indicated
to
be
areas
of
primarily
local
concerns,
but
as
to
what
the
act
has
intended
and
the
debates
reflect
it
clearly
as
matters
where
there
is
some
basis
for
federal
jurisdiction
where
there
is
a
crossing
of
state
lines,
where
there
was
an
institution
such
as
the
federally
insured
bank
here,
where
there
is
a
really
substantial
federal
interest
and
certainly
--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
in
fact
i
think
that
a
close
examination
of
the
legislative
history,
really
it
makes
a
stronger
case
than
that.
there
is
simply
is
other
than
the
fact
that
they
are
just
expressions
of
concern
regarding
racketeering,
there
is
no
showing
that
any
limitation
that
was
unstated
in
the
act
to
some
definition
of
“racketeering”
was
intended
so
it
is
even
a
clearer
case
than
that,
which
you
make.
so
we
believe
that
since
neither
the
legislative
history
nor
any
concerns
for
federalism
justify
importing
a
vague
concept
into
the
act,
which
will
simply
make
more
difficult
its
enforcement,
without
in
any
way
screening
out
cases
in
which
there
is
a
lesser
federal
interest
shows
that
there
is
no
grounds
for
the
construction
of
the
act
chosen
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
we
therefore
respectfully
submit
that
its
judgment
should
be
reversed.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
just
a
few
brief
points,
the
first
is
that,
despite
respondent’s
arguments
there
is
not
one
shred
of
legislative
history
that
indicates
intent
to
place
an
unstated
limitation
on
this
broad
language
to
limit
it
only
to
some
activities
called
“racketeering.”
the
1934
act
was
officially
titled
and
i
quote,
“an
act
to
protect
trade
and
commerce
against
interference
by
violence,
threats,
coercion
or
intimidation".
that
word
racketeering
is
not
mentioned
in
either
of
the
two
acts,
it
is
not
mentioned
in
the
titles
and
we
do
not
believe
that
fair
reading
of
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
it
was
intended
to
have
some
unstated
limitations.
we
think
the
fact
that
there
is
no
definite
definition
of
“racketeering”
fully
supports
that
point.
there
is
a
definition
of
“racketeering”
in
section
1961
of
title
xviii,
that
definition
was
adopted
in
i
believe
in
1970
and
certainly
it
cannot
be
suggested
that
that
definition
was
intended
to
apply
in
1934.
the
committee
definition
is
clearly
not
what
congress
intended
to
reach
in
either
of
the
two
acts,
the
committee’s
working
definition,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
committee
reports
clearly
reflect
the
fact
that
no
limitations
to
conspiracy
or
to
some
kind
of
organized
activity
was
intended
to
be
required
by
this
act.
they
purposely
omitted
that
particular
element
and
indeed
i
should
note
that
the
committee’s
working
definition
was
first
publicly
published
in
a
report
that
appeared
in
1937,
detailing
three
years
of
its
work.
that
working
definition
does
not
appear
in
the
committee
reports
which
were
put
out
to
define
the
scope
of
the
1934
act
that
we
have
in
question
here
and
they
do
not
appear
directly
in
connection
with
the
legislative
history
of
that
act.
it
is
simply
a
working
definition
of
all
of
the
work
of
a
committee
that
introduced
ninety
some
bills
in
1934,
bills
relating
to
kidnapping,
to
mutiny
in
federal
penal
institutions,
to
interstate
transportation
of
stolen
property,
as
well
as
to
the
act
we
had
under
consideration
here.
respondent
seems
to
be
arguing
that
what
congress
ought
to
have
done,
is
to
have
defined
“racketeering”
as
it
did
in
section
1961
and
then
to
have
made
that
kind
of
activity
punishable
either
generally
because
it
found
that
all
racketeering
affects
interstate
commerce
or
only
in
so
far
that
it
affects
interstate
commerce,
but
congress
simply
did
not
do
that.
the
legislative
history
does
not
reflect
intent
to
do
that
and
certainly
language
of
the
acts
does
not
reflect
any
such
intent.
furthermore
the
purpose,
which
respondent
is
suggesting
a
limitation
of
an
act
is
required;
the
purpose
of
keeping
the
federal
government
from
intruding
into
the
areas
of
state
concern
is
in
no
way
served
by
limiting
this
act
to
racketeering.
it
simply
will
not
have
the
purpose
of
screening
out
cases
where
there
is
no
very
strong
or
very
great
federal
interest,
as
it
might
be
defined
by
individual
judges
or
justices.
indeed,
we
think
as
the
questions
indicated
by
the
court
today,
that
this
is
a
case
of
a
very
strong
federal
interest,
but
at
least
as
the
ninth
circuit
construes
the
act
with
the
racketeering
requirement,
this
case
falls
outside
of
the
scope
of
the
hobbs
act.
so
we
think
it
is
not
a
sensible
limitation
to
limit
the
incursion
on
state
jurisdiction
and
there
is
no
support
for
it
in
the
language
or
in
the
legislative
history,
which
is
detailed
fully
in
our
brief,
thank
you.
