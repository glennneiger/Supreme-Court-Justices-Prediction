mr.
hewitt,
i
have
another
problem
with
your
reading
in
this
exception
for
“racketeering”,
if
“racketeering”
is
a
conspiracy
to
use
intimidation
to
extort
money
or
whatever
the
language
was.
why
is
it
not
that
what
this
was
anyway?
this
is
two
people
involved
in
this
plan
to
threaten
this
person
with
violence
in
order
to
get
money
out
of
the
bank?
why
does
it
not
fit
with
right
within
the
“racketeering”
definition
anyway?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
(inaudible)
had
violated
the
statute
and
you
say
no
it
does
not
violate
the
statute
because
it
is
not
“racketeering”
and
then
you
describe
“racketeering”
in
a
way
that
i
think
fits
these
facts.
or
do
i
miss
something?
