justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
that
any
plea
of
guilty
is
subject
to
collateral
attack
or
a
direct
appeal
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
not
voluntary
and
i
suppose
another
limit
is
that
the
defendant
should
have
the
adequate
counsel?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
the
negotiation
is
really
with
counsel
as
much
as
with
anybody.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
a
claim
in
this
case,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
plea
was
coerced?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
it
is
just
a
conclusion.
the
real
point
or
the
real
argument
is
that
there
should
be
a
per
se
rule
that
would
might
prevent
some
actual
coercion?
justice
byron
r.
white
tell
me
again,
perhaps
you
have
already
--
tell
me
again
why
a
prosecutor
would
not
say
“bring
the
habitual
criminal
charge
in
the
first
instance?”
justice
byron
r.
white
well
substantively
the
habitual
criminal
statute
represents
rather
serious
judgment
i
suppose
as
to
what
should
happen
to
a
person
and
if
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that
if
the
prosecutor
thinks
society’s
interest
demands
prosecution
for
the
more
serious
offense,
they
ought
to
put
it
on
the
indictment?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
your
client
knew
what
he
faced
under
the
law
from
his
attorney?
justice
byron
r.
white
some
of
our
cases
say
that
certainly
the
adequacy
of
counsel
issue
survives
pleas
of
guilty.
are
you
suggesting
that
the
counsel
was
inadequate
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
there
was
adequate
counsel
in
this
case
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
counsel
is
adequate,
he
can
advise
his
client
what
kind
of
penalties
he
faces
for
his
conduct.
he
probably
knows
more
about
it
or
he
should
know
more
about
it
than
the
prosecutor.
he
probably
knows
more
about
what
the
defendant
did
than
the
prosecutor?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
that
still
be
here
if
the
prosecutor
says
what
he
said
here
then
gets
the
broader
indictment
after
the
defendant
does
not
plead
and
then
bargaining
resumes?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
originally
he
had
only
a
narrow
indictment
and
he
said
“if
you
do
not
plead
to
his
one
i
am
going
to
get
a
broader
one?”
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
this
situation
had
resulted
in
a
guilty
plea,
the
claim
of
coercion
would
still
have
been
open?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
did?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you
if
you
would
have
a
different
position
if
there
had
never
been
any
bargaining
confrontations
between
the
prosecutor
and
the
defendant?
simply,
initially,
there
was
an
indictment.
no
plea
of
guilty
was
forthcoming.
the
prosecutor
added
a
count.
he
broadened
the
indictment.
no
plea
of
guilty
was
forthcoming,
and
he
kept
broadening
it.
then
they
went
to
trial.
would
you
be
here
then
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
face-to-face
confrontation
and
the
oral
threat
as
you
call
it,
really
is
not
determinative
in
the
case?
