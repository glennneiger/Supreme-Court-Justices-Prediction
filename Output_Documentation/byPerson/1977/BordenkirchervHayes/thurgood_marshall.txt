it
was
a
forgery
of
an
$88
check?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
$88.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
years
for
that
(inaudible)?
justice
thurgood
marshall
good.[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
would
happen
if
the
prosecutor
said
“we
have
got
overwhelming
evidence
of
you
uttering
the
$88-check,”
and
you
are
indicted
for
that“
and
we
also
have
overwhelming
evidence
that
you
also
embezzled
$460.
if
you
do
not
plead
on
the
check,
we
will
indict
you
on
the
other
one.”
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
okay.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said
it
is
entirely
different?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
you
find
anything
wrong
with
that,
where
you
were
using
some
pressure?
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
he
says
“we
also
have
an
overwhelming
evidence
that
your
wife
also
stole
$180.
if
you
do
not
plead,
we
will
indict
her?”
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
will
go
back
to
my
original
one.
if
he
says
“we
can
indict
you
for
another
offense.
you
uttered
two
checks,
one
for
$88
and
one
for
$160.
we
got
the
best
evidence
in
the
world
on
both
of
them.
we
have
got
you
on
the
$88
one
when
we
got
you
indicted
on
that
one.
if
you
plead
guilty
on
that
one,
we
will
not
indict
you
on
the
other
one?”
justice
thurgood
marshall
some
will
not
agree
that
you
can
have
“legitimate
pressure?”
justice
thurgood
marshall
one
means
apples
and
the
other
means
rocks?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
are
not
saying
it
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
are
limits
that
the
prosecutor
could
go
to,
if
you
say
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
everybody
agrees
on
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
aprile,
you
keep
saying
re-indictment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
brother
blackmun
is
not
talking
about
a
re-indictment,
he
is
talking
about
original
indictment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
let
me
put
it
separately.
in
this
particular
county
where
this
man
was
convicted,
do
you
have
any
doubt
that
the
prosecutor
in
that
one
is
going
to
over
indict?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
assume
he
will
read
the
opinion
of
this
court?
