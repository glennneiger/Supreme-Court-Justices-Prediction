justice
potter
stewart
mr.
chenoweth.
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky,
after
a
grand
jury
has
indicted
someone
under
your
habitual
criminal
statute,
may
the
prosecutor
dismiss
that
indictment
without
consent
of
the
court,
is
he
free
to
do
whatever
he
wishes
to
do?
justice
potter
stewart
just
on
the
prosecutor;s
say
so?
it
does
not
require
consent
of
court
or
if
it
does
it
is
a
rubber
stamp
operation?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
would
be
pro
forma
granted?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
the
grand
jury
who
has
brought
the
indictment?
justice
potter
stewart
and
upon
the
showing
of
the
prosecutor?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
going
to
be
dismissed
in
practical
fact
in
the
unreviewable
and
untrammeled
discretion
of
the
prosecutor,
is
that
it?
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
is
in
the
commonwealth?
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
really
saying
that?
as
i
understand
your
answer,
you
are
saying
there
is
no
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
court.
once
the
prosecutor
takes
the
position,
the
court
has
to
go
along?
justice
potter
stewart
then
there
is
some
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
court?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now
wait
a
minute.
now,
you
have
given
two
different
answers.
i
asked
for
information
and
you
said
it
was
a
rubber
stamp
pro
forma
operation
and
now
you
are
saying
something
quite
different.
what
is
the
answer?
justice
potter
stewart
your
law
requires
that
a
grand
jury
indictment
can
be
dismissed
only
with
consent
of
the
court
or
does
it
not,
first
of
all,
just
what
the
law
provides?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
do
not
know
of
any?
in
your
experience
or
knowledge,
you
have
never
heard
of
it?
justice
potter
stewart
nor
ever
heard
of
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
point
is,
first,
that
this
court
has
explicitly
approved
the
procedure
of
plea
bargaining?
justice
potter
stewart
and
secondly,
that
the
very
concept
of
plea
bargaining
like
the
very
concept
of
any
bargaining
involves
the
use
of
leverage
or,
if
you
will,
a
pressure
on
both
sides?
justice
potter
stewart
what
the
defendant
has
to
offer,
first
of
all,
is
that
there
is
always
a
risk
from
the
prosecutor’s
point
of
view
of
a
jury
finding
him
not
guilty?
justice
potter
stewart
secondly,
there
is
always
the
certainty
of
a
not
guilty
plea
of
expending
the
time
and
resources
of
the
prosecutor
and
of
the
court
and
of
the
judge,
that
is
what
the
defendant
--
those
are
the
tools
in
his
hands,
are
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
it
is
perfectly
permissible
constitutionally,
plea
bargaining
as
such?
justice
potter
stewart
there
can
be
an
abuse?
justice
potter
stewart
so
far
in
the
cases
in
this
court,
rather
than
limits
the
court
has
been
concerned
with
assuring
that
the
bargain
is
kept,
is
that
not
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
santobello
and
the
case
last
term?
justice
potter
stewart
yes
and
the
court,
while
it
may
have
and
probably
has
talked
about
the
fact
that
there
are
some
limits,
it
has
not
in
any
way
tried
to
define
the
meets
and
bounds
of
those
limits,
rather
it
has
been
concerned
with
assuring
that
the
promise
be
kept,
is
that
not
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
bargain
is
struck,
it
must
be
kept?
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
if
there
is
actual
coercion,
then
it
is
not
bargaining
anymore.
that
is,
if
there
is
brutality,
compelling
a
person
to
plead
guilty
or
trickery
or
deception,
then
it
is
not
longer
bargaining.
we
had
a
pro
curium
not
so
long
ago
involving
that
kind
of
a
situation?
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
it
is
fair
bargaining,
the
court
so
far
has
not
defined
any
limits?
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
the
concepts
of
the
federal
labor
laws
are
not
very
helpful,
although
you
have
used
the
same
word
or
i
did?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
true
if
it
serves
to
flaw
the
trial
or
appellant
process?
justice
potter
stewart
north
carolina
against
pearce
held
that
vindictiveness
or
the
threat
of
vindictiveness
would
impair
the
absolute
right
that
was
accorded
by
the
state
to
appeal
or
to
collaterally
attack
a
conviction
and
thereby
impaired
and
impeded
and
flawed
the
appellate
process
or
the
collateral
attack
process.
here,
your
adversary
tells
us
that
there
is
no
flawing
of
any
right
that
is
given?
justice
potter
stewart
or
a
statutory
right
or
appeal?
justice
potter
stewart
if
that
is
the
case,
what
you
describe
always
what
the
upshot
of
what
happens
when
a
plea
bargaining
is
unsuccessful,
always.
then,
after,
if
plea
bargaining
comes
to
an
impasse,
then
the
defendant
pleads
not
guilty
and
he
goes
to
trial
under
the
risk
of
a
conviction
of
a
greater
offense
or
of
a
longer
sentence
than
he
would
have
achieved
in
the
plea
bargain.
that
is
the
whole
nature
of
the
beast,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
is
when
a
bargain
is
reached,
but
when
a
bargain
is
not
reached,
what
you
describe
is
always
the
result.
if
the
defendant
pleads
not
guilty
and
he
gets
to
trial
under
the
risk
of
getting
worst
and
longer
sentence
in
a
more
serious
conviction
than
he
would
have
plead
guilty
to
if
the
bargain
had
been
negotiated.
that
is
always
the
result,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
he
was
told
in
the
process
of
the
bargaining,
what
the
result
would
be?
justice
potter
stewart
and
did
the
prosecutor
not
further
say
if
you
do
not
plead
guilty,
what
is
going
to
happen?
justice
potter
stewart
could
i
ask
you
if
in
kentucky
that
plea
bargaining
goes
on
prior
to
indictment?
justice
potter
stewart
never?
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
quite
sure
it
does
some
places.
justice
potter
stewart
i
would
suppose
that
if
in
those
places
where
it
does,
if
we
we
affirm
the
sixth
circuit,
no
one
could
afford
a
plea
bargain
until
after
the
grand
jury
met
and
the
indictments
came
down?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now
that
is
important,
mr.
aprile.
it
seems
to
me
it
may
be
a
subtle
difference,
but
it
strikes
me
that
it
might
be
a
dispositive
one.
you
have
stated
this
case
so
far
as
though
there
were
plea
bargaining
within
the
original
charge,
as
indeed
there
was,
but
that
that
was
the
extent
of
the
plea
bargaining
on
the
count
of
uttering
the
forged
check
and
offered
by
the
prosecutor
to
recommend
a
five-year
sentence.
after
that
plea
bargaining
failed
then,
without
any
further
opportunity
for
the
defendant,
the
prosecutor
went
on
his
own
hook
and
got
the
grand
jury
to
indict
under
the
habitual
criminal
statute
with
no
further
opportunity
for
the
defendant
to
bargain
and
thereby
the
prosecutor
penalized
the
defendant’s
constitutional
right
to
plead
not
guilty.
now,
that
would
be
one
case,
it
seems
to
me,
but
if,
on
the
other
hand,
the
other
case
would
be
if
the
chronology
were
that
there
was
bargaining
under
the
original
charge
and
the
defendant
said
“no,
i
think
i
might
plead
not
guilty,”
then
the
prosecutor
said
“well,
if
you
do
that,
i
am
going
to
go
to
the
grand
jury
and
get
them
to
indict
under
the
habitual
criminal
statute
under
which
you
can
get
five
imprisonment.”
then,
if
there
were
an
opportunity
for
additional
bargaining
that
would
be
quite
a
different
case,
it
seems
to
me.
the
difference
may
seem
like
a
subtle
one,
but
it
might
be
because
the
second
case
is
a
different
case
from
the
one
you
have
presented
to
us,
it
seems
to
me?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
what
did
happen
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
that.
that
was
the
initial
negotiation.
justice
potter
stewart
does
that
imply
that
there
was
still
an
opportunity
for
the
defendant
to
plead
guilty
and
get
a
recommendation
of
the
prosecutor
of
five
years
or
was
it
too
late?
was
this
a
vindictive
punishment
to
him
for
turning
down
the
original
bargain?
justice
potter
stewart
those
are
two
different
cases?
justice
potter
stewart
when
can
it
happen
is
my
question?
justice
potter
stewart
you
do
not
mean
if
he
wanted
to
plead
not
guilty?
justice
potter
stewart
and
accept
the
bargain
of
a
recommendation
of
a
five-year
sentence?
justice
potter
stewart
my
question
is,
factually,
was
there
still
an
opportunity?
was
that
still
a
continuation
of
the
bargaining
or
was
it
a
punishment
of
the
defendant
for
his
failure
to
reach
an
agreement?
now,
which
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
still
open
to
him?
justice
potter
stewart
up
here
we
do
not
generally
have
a
dispute
of
facts.
we
take
the
facts
as
they
are
and
try
to
apply
the
law?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
a
different
case
than
the
one
you
presented?
justice
potter
stewart
what
you
just
stated
is
always
just
describing
plea
bargaining
generally?
justice
potter
stewart
what
case
is
that,
the
montana
case
in
your
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
have
a
citation?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
1306?
justice
potter
stewart
some
states
have
abolished
plea
bargaining
all
together?
justice
potter
stewart
this
case
is
here
because
the
grant
of
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit,
the
respondent,
paul
lewis
hayes
was
indicted
by
a
grand
jury
in
kentucky
on
a
charge
of
uttering
a
forged
instrument,
offense
then
punishable
by
a
term
of
2
to
10
years
in
prison.
after
arraignment,
hayes,
his
retained
counsel,
and
the
commonwealth's
attorney
met
in
the
presence
of
the
clerk
of
the
court
to
discuss
a
possible
plea
agreement.
during
these
conferences
the
prosecutor
offered
to
recommend
a
sentence
of
five
years
in
prison
if
hayes
would
plead
guilty
to
the
indictment.
he
also
said
that
if
hayes
did
not
plead
guilty
and
in
his
words,
"save
the
court
the
inconvenience
and
necessity
of
a
trial,"
he
would
return
to
the
grand
jury
to
seek
an
indictment
under
the
kentucky
habitual
criminal
act,
which
would
subject
hayes
to
a
mandatory
sentence
of
life
imprisonment
by
reason
of
his
two
prior
felony
convictions.
hayes
chose
not
to
plead
guilty,
and
the
prosecutor
did
obtain
an
indictment
charging
him
under
the
habitual
criminal
act.
a
jury
found
hayes
guilty
on
the
principal
charge
of
uttering
a
forged
instrument
and,
in
a
separate
proceeding,
further
found
that
he
had
twice
before
been
convicted
of
felonies.
as
required
by
the
habitual
offender
statute,
he
was
sentenced
to
a
life
term
in
the
penitentiary
and
these
convictions
were
affirmed
on
appeal
by
the
-
in
the
kentucky
courts.
on
hayes'
petition
for
a
federal
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
kentucky
agreed
that
there
had
been
no
constitutional
violation
in
the
sentence
or
the
indictment
procedure,
and
denied
the
writ.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
reversed
the
district
court's
judgment.
we
granted
certiorari
to
consider
a
constitutional
question
of
importance
in
the
administration
of
criminal
justice.
for
the
reasons
set
out
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
filed
today,
we
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
breadth
of
discretion
that
our
country's
legal
system
vests
in
prosecuting
attorneys
carries
with
it
the
potential
for
both
individual
and
institutional
abuse.
and
broad
though
that
discretion
may
be,
there
are
undoubtedly
constitutional
limits
upon
its
exercise.
but
we
hold
that
the
course
of
conduct
engaged
in
by
the
prosecutor
in
this
case,
which
no
more
than
openly
presented
the
defendant
with
the
unpleasant
alternatives
of
forgoing
trial
or
facing
charges
on
which
he
was
plainly
subject
to
prosecution,
did
not
violate
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
marshall
have
joined
and
mr.
justice
powell
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
