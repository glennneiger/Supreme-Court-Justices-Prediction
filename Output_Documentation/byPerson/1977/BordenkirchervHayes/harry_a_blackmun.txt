justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let
me
interrupt
you
there.
why
would
he
reach
that
conclusion?
do
you
think
that
plea
bargaining
is
more
likely
to
ensue
with
an
initial
lighter
charge
than
the
enhancement
aspect?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
why
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
are
coming
up
from
the
other
side
of
the
case.
why
does
the
prosecutor
not
bring
everything
in
the
original
indictment
or
information,
everything
and
take
it
from
there
with
his
plea
bargaining,
if
that
is
what
he
wants?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
thought
you
are
saying
that
he
has
to
give
away
more?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
does
that
not
sound
like
a
better
deal
for
the
defendant
then?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
it
not
anything
that
is
strange
to
the
defendant?
he
knows
what
his
record
is
and
he
knows
this
is
hanging
over
him
like
a
sword,
so
to
speak.
i
guess
i
have
trouble
following
any
explanation
of
why
the
one
charge
is
initially
brought
and
the
other
is
used
as
dynamite
in
reserve?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
will
give
you
one
reason
that
neither
you
nor
your
opposition
suggests,
at
least
i
think
it
is
a
reason,
is
not
bail
likely
to
be
higher?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
realize
this
and
i
intend
to
ask
your
opponent
that
same
question,
but
i
think
this
is
a
consequence
that
perhaps
there
is
a
reason
for
not
bringing
the
initial,
the
full
charge
initially?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
do
not
think
anybody
is
being
fooled.
everyone
knows
what
the
record
is.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
is
also
my
question.
are
you
not
in
effect,
if
you
prevail,
forcing
precautionary
overcharging,
to
use
the
phrase,
one
that
you
use
in
your
briefs,
and
therefore,
if
you
prevail
are
you
not
actually
winning
nothing
or
in
other
words,
does
the
case
not
amount
to
very
little?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
then
i
come
back
to
where
i
started.
if
you
prevail,
you
are
going
to
have
every
case
with
a
full
fledged
indictment
from
here
on
in
so
that
you
gain
really
nothing.
you
have
a
phyrric
victory
in
future
cases?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
because
every
prosecutor
is
going
to
indict
all
of
your
defendants
on
a
habitual
criminal
charge?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
they
are
not
only
going
to
threaten,
they
are
going
to
indict
from
here
on
in.
that
is
the
only
way
that
they
can
protect
themselves.
what
do
you
gain?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
therefore,
why
leave
it
as
an
initial
indictment?
why
not
bring
a
broader
one
at
the
start?
it
takes
your
case
completely
out
from
under
you.
