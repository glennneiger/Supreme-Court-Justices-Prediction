justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
attorney
general,
may
i
ask
a
question.
if
we
assume
for
a
moment
that
it
really
does
not
matter
whether
the
man
is
indictment
on
all
charges
and
some
are
dismissed
or
he
is
just
indicted
on
some
later,
the
others
are
added
on
if
he
does
not
enter
into
a
plea,
is
there
not
nevertheless
perhaps
a
different
problem
that
this
case
indicates
and
that
is
this.
if
there
is
a
gross
disparity
between
the
charge
that
the
prosecutor
is
willing
to
abandon
whether
in
advance
of
negotiation
or
later
and
the
lesser
charge
that
he
really
wants
to
get
a
conviction
on,
is
there
not
some
risk
that
a
quite
remote
danger
of
conviction
on
a
charge
that
might
bring
life
imprisonment
or
death
or
something
like
that,
for
the
prosecutor
to
give
up
that
possible
result
in
exchange
for
a
30-day
sentence,
would
it
not
inherently
make
you
wonder
whether
there
was
not
sufficient
in
terrorem
effect
that
an
innocent
man
might
plead
guilty
to
the
lighter
charge?
is
it
not
that
the
problem
as
the
comparison
between
what
one
side
is
going
to
give
up
in
exchange
for
what
it
gets
does
on
the
timing
of
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
agree.
that
does
not
go
to
the
question
that
you
have
been
arguing
as
to
whether
the
one
has
to
come
ahead
of
the
other
in
terms
of
the
procedure.
is
there
not
a
potential
for
prosecutorial
abuse
in
the
kind
of
situation
i
described
and
then
to
go
further,
what
were
the
alternatives
in
this
case?
one
was
life
sentence
as
opposed
to,
what,
five
years?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
your
argument
about
that.
but
you
did
seem
to
suggest
there
are
limits
to
what
the
prosecutor
might
do
and
i
am
really
asking
you
whether
one
of
those
limits
is
not
having
charges
that
are
so
disparate
that
an
innocent
man
might
be
tempted
to
plead
guilty
to
a
very
minor
charge
in
order
to
avoid
risk
of
conviction
of
a
very
major
charge.
is
that
a
possible
limit?
if
not,
what
limits
are
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
understood
you
to
say
it
does
not
matter
whether
the
charges
are
related
or
unrelated.
that
is
not
the
touchdown.
you
can
follow
the
same
procedure
here
with
totally
unrelated
events?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what,
if
any,
is
the
limit
on
their
discretion
which
should
guide
the
prosecutor
in
this
kind
of
negotiation.
should
we
not
be
concerned
about
the
risk
that
an
innocent
man
may
be
induced
to
plead
guilty
to
a
minor
charge
in
this
kind
of
negotiation?
is
that
not
what
we
really
are
concerned
about?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
there
any
limit
to
the
discretion
that
you
are
saying?
justice
john
paul
stevens
where
is
it?
where
do
we
look
for
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that
you
do
not
offer
any
alternatives?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that
you
do
not
suggest
any
limit
either.
you
just
acknowledge
there
is
some
limit
somewhere
but
you
have
no
idea
of
how
to
identify?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
never
had
a
limit
based
on
the
disparity
between
the
charge
that
he
is
asked
to
plead
to
and
the
charge
you
will
have
to
go
to
trial
if
he
does
not
plead?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
is
not
what
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
says?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
says
that
during
this
conference
the
prosecutor
offered
to
recommend
the
five-year
sentence
if
hayes
would
plead
guilty,
petitioner
was
warned
that
if
he
did
not
plead
guilty
he
will
be
charged
under
the
habitual
criminal
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
aprile,
let
me
interrupt
there.
if
we
focus
on
actual
vindictiveness
as
i
guess
is
the
standard
you
would
suggest,
what
if
you
had
this
situation?
that
a
prosecutor
presents
to
the
grand
jury
a
charge
of
uttering
an
$88-forged
check
and
a
second
count
habitual
criminal
charge
which
bears
a
life
sentence.
at
the
time
he
does
so,
he
has
no
intention
whatsoever
of
going
to
trial
on
the
second
charge.
he
presents
the
charge
to
the
grand
jury
solely
for
the
purpose
of
having
a
bargaining
ticket
which
he
can
use
to
coerce
the
defendant
into
pleading
guilty
to
the
$88-charge.
could
one
not
call
that
actual
vindictiveness?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
could
you
not
make
a
strong
argument
for
the
proposition
that
that
would
be
actual
vindictiveness?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
overcharging
in
the
sense
that
the
prosecutor
has
no
interest
whatsoever
in
getting
a
conviction
on
the
second
charge.
he
brings
it
purely
for
the
purpose
of
enhancing
his
bargaining
power
on
the
$88-charge?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
same
interest
is
served
in
both
cases.
the
purpose
of
the
second
count
is
simply
to
induce
a
guilty
plea
on
the
first
count.
i
do
not
know
why
it
can
be
right
in
one
context
and
wrong
in
the
other.
it
seems
to
me
it
is
either
wrong
in
both
or
wrong
in
neither?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
my
case
chills
the
constitutional
right
too.
he
has
the
same
variables
to
work
with
because
i
do
not
think
that
--
say
instead
of
being
a
habitual
criminal,
let
us
say
it
is
murder.
one
is
murder
and
the
other
one
is
an
$88-check.
is
that
“i
really
do
not
think
they
can
convict
me
of
murder,
but
my
gosh,
if
they
do,
it
is
pretty
darn
serious.
i
better
plead
guilty
to
the
$88-charge,
i
do
not
take
any
chances.”
do
you
say
that
is
different
depending
on
whether
he
is
indicted
ahead
of
time
or
merely
told
in
the
plea
bargain
that
this
is
a
consequence
that
might
ensue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
made
the
assumption.
it
is
always
for
the
purpose
of
getting
the
plea
of
guilty
to
the
lesser
charge.
that
is
why
he
does
it,
is
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
both
cases,
the
intention
is
if
you
will
plead
guilty
to
the
lesser
charge,
we
will
not
prosecute
on
the
other.
if
he
does
not
plead
guilty,
we
will
shoot
the
works
and
get
him
for
whatever
we
can?
