mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
initially
point
out
that
this
case
does
not
require
a
per
se
or
a
prophylactic
rule
for
this
respondent
to
succeed
and
be
entitled
to
the
relief
that
was
awarded
to
him
by
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
below.
the
reason
for
this
is
quite
clear.
this
court,
as
far
back
as
north
carolina
v.
pearce,
in
your
opinion
in
chaffin
v.
stynchcombe
and
also
in
your
opinion
in
michigan
v.
pane,
indicated
that
this
court
has
always
recognized
that
actual
vindictiveness
is
a
due
process
violation
or
can
amount
to
a
due
process
violation,
when
it
is
perpetrated
by
an
actor
in
the
criminal
justice
system.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
of
course,
if
we
look
at
it
in
a
three-fold
analysis
we
would
see
first,
under
the
prophylactic
rule
of
north
carolina
v.
pearce,
the
intention
is
to
prevent
the
apprehension
or
the
fear
of
some
sort
of
retaliation
from
stopping
or
chilling
anyone
from
exercising
a
constitutional
right.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
or
a
statutory
right
or
a
procedural
rule
right
perhaps,
but
the
point
there
was
that
the
man
had
the
opportunity
to
do
something
that
was
legitimate.
in
the
next
instance,
we
have
something
legitimate
done
with
actual
vindictiveness
and
i
believe
it
was
mr.
justice
powell
pointing
out
in
michigan
v.
pane
we
have
always
recognized
actual
vindictiveness,
even
the
doing
of
something
that
is
permitted
with
actual
vindictiveness
would
be
a
due
process
violation.
in
this
case,
the
actual
vindictiveness
was
to
say
“if
you
will
exercise
your
constitutional
right
to
a
trial
before
a
jury
to
plead
not
guilty,
to
have
the
right
to
confront
witnesses
against
you,
to
be
free
from
self-incrimination,
i
am
going
to
put
a
penalty
on
it
and
that
is
the
sole
reason
i
am
doing
it.”
the
sixth
circuit
found
this
in
the
penultimate
paragraph
of
their
opinion
when
they
clearly
said
“we
do
not
need
to
infer
vindictiveness
in
this
case.
it
has
been
admitted
by
the
prosecutor.”
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
would
hearken
back
to
this
court’s
analysis
in
brady
v.
united
states
where
you
described
plea
bargaining
as
mutuality
of
advantage.
and
you
said
that
we
could
not
hold
it
unconstitutional
--
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
i
do
not
believe
that
it
is
always
the
result
of
the
same
magnitude
and
that
is
the
difference
in
this
case.
let
me
give
you
this
example.
in
the
case
at
bar,
the
initial
bargaining
positions
that
the
defendant
was
in
when
he
stood
charged
with
the
uttering
a
forged
instrument
indictment,
unenhanced
was
that
he
faced
if
he
pled
not
guilty,
he
faced
a
maximum
sentence
of
10
years.
that
was
the
anti
for
exercising
his
constitutional
rights.
those
were
the
table
stakes.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
no,
your
honor.
initially,
what
i
am
saying
is
when
the
indictment
came
down,
this
was
what
he
faced
if
he
exercised
this
constitutional
rights.
then,
the
prosecutor
came
to
him
and
tendered
to
him
the
following
offer:
plead
guilty,
i
will
recommend
to
the
judge
a
five-year
sentence,
no
guarantee.
the
defendant
then
said
--
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
no,
your
honor,
not
to
that
point.
when
from
the
record
we
see
that
when
the
arrangement
offered
by
the
prosecutor
was
rejected,
he
then
threatened
that
if
you
do
not
accept
my
plea
bargain
and
plead
guilty,
i
am
going
to
increase
the
stakes
against
you.
i
am
going
to
re-indict
you
as
a
habitual
criminal
with
two
prior
felonies
and
if
we
can
convict
you
of
that
there
will
be
a
mandatory
life
sentence.
now,
i
submit
to
you
the
distinction
is
very
different
because
when
he
places
the
threat
on
him
after
he
has
attempted
to
exercise
his
constitutional
right,
the
only
purpose
for
the
threat
is
to
deter
the
exercise
of
the
constitutional
rights.
in
the
situation
that
the
sixth
circuit
posited
was
put
your
cards
on
the
table,
tell
the
man
what
the
charges
are.
what
is
the
maximum
punishment
he
faces?
if
he
refuses
to
negotiate
with
you
he
still
faces
that
maximum
punishment.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
your
honor,
i
would
--
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
your
honor,
the
first
point
i
would
make
is
to
refer
back
to
the
footnote
in
brady
v.
the
united
states
where
i
believe
this
court
gave
it
at
least
the
implicit
recognition
that
you
would
find
guilty
pleas
coerced
if
the
charging
power
of
the
prosecutor
was
abused
by
overcharging
when
evidence
did
not
support
it.
so
i
think
--
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
your
honor,
that
was
not
the
response
that
i
gave.
the
response
was
to
the
initial
problem
of
overcharging
that
justice
was
pointing
to.
i
agree.
i
am
not
saying
this
was
overcharging.
but
i
think
it
begs
reality
to
submit
that
the
prosecutor
cannot
indict,
which
is
the
normal
practice
in
kentucky
by
the
way
to
indict
on
both
the
substantive
offense
and
the
habitual
offender
offense,
now
we
call
it.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
because
your
honor,
it
is
clear
to
people
who
are
caught
up
in
the
criminal
justice
system
that
paul
lewis
hayes
and
people
in
his
situation
when
they
exercise
their
constitutional
rights
to
plead
not
guilty
and
turn
down
a
plea
bargain
offer
are
punished
for
it
and
it
would
not
appear
that
way
your
honor,
if
it
was
clear
to
people
that
this
was
the
initial
maximum
punishment
that
a
person
faced.
i
believe
this
court
recognized
that
very
real
problem
in
north
carolina
v.
pearce
and
blackledge
v.
perry
when
you
said
apprehension
of
this
type
--
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
it
was
not
to
paul
lewis
hayes,
but
it
would
be
to
many
people
within
the
criminal
justice
system.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
your
honor,
that
is
a
very
interesting
point
that
you
make.
the
actual
record
in
this
case
reveals
that
mr.
hayes’
trial
attorney,
i
was
not
his
trial
attorney,
did
not
make
this
objection,
but
at
the
beginning
of
the
habitual
portion
of
the
trial,
paul
lewis
hayes
personally
approached
the
judge
and
said
“i
object
to
the
way
that
i
had
been
indicted
as
habitual
offender
because
it
was
done
solely
because
i
refused
to
plead
guilty
to
the
forgery
charge.”
the
defense
attorney
did
not
even
recognize
the
issue
apparently.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
your
honor,
there
is
no
plea
of
guilty
in
this
case.
paul
lewis
hayes
went
ahead.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
your
honor,
since
the
issue
was
clearly
preserved
in
the
state
courts
and
raised
on
this
particular
issue,
yes,
i
do
not
think
that
the
adequacy
of
the
counsel
is
the
problem.
i
think
that
quite
clearly
the
issue
of
vindictiveness
was
raised.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
your
honor,
i
would
submit
that
the
sixth
circuit
was
correct
when
they
stated
that
when
a
prosecutor
with
knowledge
of
the
facts
of
the
crime
seeks
and
obtains
an
indictment
on
a
charge
less
severe
than
the
facts
warrant,
he
makes
a
discretionary
determination
that
that
is
the
appropriate
charge.
so
he
did
this
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
no,
your
honor,
plea
bargaining
does
not
go
on
prior
to
indictment.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
i
would
say
this,
your
honor.
i
am
a
public
defender
and
with
clients
that
i
represent,
it
does
not
go
on
prior
to
indictment.
there
are
some
sort
of
white
collar
crimes
in
kentucky,
possibly
are
political
type
crimes,
where
that
type
of
situation
may
occur.
but
having
had
ample
opportunity
to
survey
the
criminal
justice
system
in
both
urban
and
rural
areas
of
our
state,
i
would
say,
no,
plea
bargaining
does
not
occur
prior
to
indictment
in
our
state.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
reality
in
this
situation
is
that
in
brady
v.
united
states,
as
i
recall
you
writing
that
opinion
pointed
out
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
to
hold
that
prosecutors
could
not
extend
as
benefits
concessions,
dismissed
counts
and
to
allow
pleas
to
lower
lesser
included
offenses
of
the
charged
offense.
i
thought
it
was
important
that
you
emphasize
the
charged
offense.
in
this
case,
we
are
not
talking
about
concessions
relating
to
a
charged
offense.
this
man
was
told
“if
you
do
not
negotiate,
we
will
up
the
ante
against
you.”
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
to
a
certain
degree
--
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
in
this
case,
the
initial
bargain
did
not
involve
any
charge.
the
initial
bargain
presented
by
the
prosecutor
related
only
to
the
charged
offense,
as
best
we
can
tell
from
the
record.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
the
actual
statement
of
the
prosecutor
in
the
record
is
that
“is
it
not
a
fact
that
i
told
you
if
you
did
not
intend
to
save
the
court
the
inconvenience
and
necessity
of
a
trial
and
taking
up
this
time
that
i
intended
to
return
to
the
grand
jury
and
ask
them
to
indict
you
based
upon
these
prior
felony
convictions?”
page
49
and
50
of
the
appendix
in
context
reveals
it
was
after
the
initial
bargain
was
tendered
to
the
individual.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
i
am
sure.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
you
are
right,
your
honor
and
i
say
this.
i
do
not
believe
that
can
be
dispositive
in
the
case.
i
see
the
distinction
that
you
are
calling.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
i
am
telling
the
court,
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
man
was
threatened
after
he
turned
down
the
original
offer
would
be
re-indicted
as
a
habitual
criminal
and
i
am
sure
that
had
mr.
hayes
wanted
to
plead
not
guilty
he
would
not
have
re-indicted
him,
but
that
was
trying
to
make
the
threat
work.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
i
mean,
if
he
wanted
to
plead
guilty,
excuse
me,
he
would
have
not
--
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
certainly,
because
that
is
threat,
that
is
what
he
wanted
to
accomplish
by
the
threat.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
i
would
say
that
it
was
a
punishment
and
a
threat
of
punishment
that
could
have
been
ameliorated
by
accepting
the
original
bargain.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
i
can
speculate
to
that,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
well,
because
paul
lewis
hayes
did
not
say
“alright,
let
me
plead
guilty”
the
prosecutor
never
answered
that
question.
but
he
said
“if
you
do
not
plead
guilty,”
so
i
imagine
that
he
was
willing
at
that
point
to
say
“yes,
i
will
let
you
go
with
the
five
years
under
the
uttering
of
forge
instrument,”
but
i
cannot
say
for
sure.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
but
i
think
the
key
point
is
that
the
intention
was
to
make
the
threat
work
and
if
the
threat
worked
by
getting
the
man
to
plead
guilty
to
the
original
charge,
then
he
accomplished
it
and
it
was
a
penalty
if
the
man
continued
to
exercise
his
constitutional
right.
so
i
do
not
think
the
distinction
is
dispositive
in
the
case.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
well,
your
honor,
if
i
would
just
use
the
criteria
that
this
court
utilized
in
north
carolina
v.
pearce
and
some
of
the
other
cases
dealing
with
vindictiveness,
you
have
always
looked
at
these
four
major
factors.
they
are
knowledge
by
the
participant
in
the
system,
the
actor,
does
he
have
knowledge
of
the
prior
penalty?
in
this
case,
the
prosecutor
clearly
knew
what
the
original
maximum
authorized
punishment
was
in
the
case,
10
years.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
your
honor
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
many
occasions,
actual
vindictiveness
is
normally
very
difficult
to
prove.
it
would
be
difficult
to
prove
his
motive.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
yes,
your
honor,
but
again,
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
prove.
i
think
that
the
point
there
is
that
if
it
was
not
overcharging
--
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
but
he
can
legitimately
bring
it,
and
therefore,
what
he
does
is
he
gives
away
a
valid
concession
for
his
goal
to
get
a
guilty
plea.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
in
this
case,
what
we
are
saying
is
he
already
made
an
election
that
there
was
no
interest
of
the
state
served
by
that
habitual
criminal
statute
indictment.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
because
the
timing
and
the
nature
of
the
threat
in
the
case
is
aimed
at
one
thing
and
that
is
chilling
the
exercise
of
the
constitutional
right
to
plead
not
guilty
and
i
think
that
if
we
look
--
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
you
are
getting
inside
the
prosecutor’s
mind,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
i
understand
that,
but
in
one
instance
it
was
the
original
intention
to
prosecute
the
person
under
both
charges
at
least
--
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
but
there
has
been
no
attempt
at
that
point
by
the
defendant
to
exercise
any
right,
and
therefore,
there
is
no
retaliation
that
takes
place
for
the
exercise
of
the
right
to
plead
not
guilty.
if
plea
bargaining
is
legitimate
and
of
course
we
do
not
challenge
that,
it
is
clear
under
your
opinion
in
brady
v.
united
states,
it
is
based
on
concessions
being
made
under
existing
charges
and
it
is
based
on
mutuality
of
advantage.
i
submit
to
you
that
that
is
a
different
situation
from
where
a
prosecutor
initially
makes
a
determination
that
this
is
a
proper
charge
and
when
he
cannot
get
the
absolute
agreement,
word
for
word
that
he
wants
from
the
defendant
then
he
turns
around
and
says
“i
will
seek
higher
and
greater
charges
against
you.”
this
is
what
the
sixth
circuit
was
afraid
of.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
no,
your
honor,
i
certainly
would
not
say
that
and
i
am
sorry
if
i
have
misrepresented
my
position
that
way.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
no,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
it
would
not
be
realistic
to
look
at
what
occurred
in
this
case
outside
of
the
situation
and
say,
well,
what
if
they
had
charged
it
originally,
because
that
is
a
different
situation.
in
this
case,
the
prosecutor
by
his
own
admission
wanted
to
penalize
paul
lewis
hayes
for
not
pleading
guilty,
for
not
saving
the
court
time,
for
not
saving
his
prosecutorial
resources,
for
not
giving
him
the
certainty
of
a
guilty
plea.
it
was
not
an
attempt
to
bargain
to
work
something
out.
it
was
if
he
will
not
do
it
my
way
then
i
insist
that
i
will
punish
you
in
another
way.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
example
given
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
a
very
good
example.
he
says
what
if
there
is
an
original
felony
charge
and
it
is
offered
by
the
prosecutor
to
amend
it
to
a
misdemeanor
and
the
defendant
turns
it
down
and
then
the
prosecutor
says
“well,
i
am
going
to
go
ahead
and
seek
the
maximum
punishment
under
that
felony
count.”
the
defendant’s
bargaining
position
has
not
been
changed
by
exercising
his
constitutional
right.
before
they
even
had
any
negotiations,
he
faced
the
exact
same
maximum
punishment.
there
is
no
upping
the
ante
for
exercising
his
right,
but
in
the
real
situation
in
the
case
at
bar,
paul
lewis
hayes
thought
that
when
he
rejected
the
prosecutor’s
plea
bargain
offer
of
five
years
that
the
most
he
would
face
was
10
years.
then,
the
prosecutor
said
“no.”
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
i
do
not
understand
why
it
is
a
phyrric
victory,
your
honor.
the
way
that
i
--
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
well
your
honor
as
i
understand
the
scenario
that
would
follow
if
this
court
reversed
and
took
the
other
position,
then
every
prosecutor
will
not
have
to
indict
on
a
higher
charge
or
an
enhanced
charge
and
he
will
still
be
able
to
threaten
the
same
thing.
so
i
do
not
see
how
my
client
or
any
other
clients
in
the
criminal
justice
system
suffer
under
you
affirming
the
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit
because
every
prosecutor
can
threaten
without
even
having
the
indictment.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
but
the
position
you
are
taking
in
this
case
would
be
that
it
would
not
make
any
difference
whether
he
is
indicted
or
not
and
that
possibility
of
the
re-indictment
will
always
exist
and
will
always
be
a
valid
type
of
leverage
for
the
prosecutor
to
use.
so
my
client
and
other
clients
in
the
criminal
justice
system
have
lost
nothing.
they
are
still
in
a
difficult
position,
but
what
i
submit
to
you
is
if
you
uphold
the
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit
what
we
do
is
we
finalize
that
here
is
an
existing
indictment,
this
is
the
maximum
authorized
punishment.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
i
understand
that,
your
honor.
i
just
thought
i
was
trying
to
make
that
distinction.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
it
has
been
four
years.
he
is
not
there
any
longer.
so
it
is
very
difficult
for
me
to
say.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
it
is
very
obvious
that
they
will
charge,
as
most
of
them
do
in
our
state,
they
will
go
ahead
and
charge
the
habitual
offender
statute
and
it
will
be
legitimate
in
that
situation
to
offer
concessions
under
that.
my
point
though,
and
i
hearken
back
to
this
time
and
time
again,
is
there
is
no
doubt
in
this
case
that
the
prosecutor
acted
because
he
wanted
to
chill
paul
lewis
hayes
from
exercising
those
constitutional
rights.
i
do
not
believe
that
that
is
what
this
court
was
talking
about
in
brady
v.
united
states
when
you
said
that
a
prosecutor
can,
at
every
step
of
the
criminal
justice
stage,
encourage
pleas
of
guilty.
this
is
not
encouraging
a
plea
of
guilty.
this
is
threatening
to
penalize
someone
for
pleading
not
guilty.
i
think
we
must
recognize
that
in
this
case
and
in
this
type
of
situation
the
prosecutor
has
the
ammunition
because
he
has
that
threat
of
re-indictment
that
he
can
always
hold
over
the
defendant’s
head.
recently,
in
june
of
this
year,
the
supreme
court
of
montana
not
having
to
pay
any
allegiance
to
the
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
their
supreme
court
recognized
the
validity
of
this
reasoning
in
their
situation
instead
under
both
federal
and
state
law
in
state
v.
sather
that
they
would
follow
this
procedure.
they
thought
it
was
a
violation
of
due
process
to
do
otherwise.
i
submit
that
it
is
clear
that
prosecutors
who
will
utilize
leverage
like
this
are
doing
it
for
only
one
purpose
and
that
is
--
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
it
is
not
cited
in
the
brief,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
yes,
i
do.
the
citation
is
564
pacific
2nd
1306.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
1977.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
yes,
your
honor,
564
pacific
2nd.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
that
is
true,
your
honor.
of
course,
although
the
petitioner
has
stated
at
all
levels
that
that
is
what
we
are
trying
to
do,
we
are
not
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
plea
bargaining.
this
court
has
recognized
it
seems
to
me,
in
your
many
cases
dealing
with
plea
bargaining,
two
things,
fairness
and
proper
administration
and
certainly
there
is
no
concept
of
ultimate
fairness
involved
here.
the
prosecutor
makes
a
determination
that
one
charge
is
sufficient,
when
he
cannot
get
his
way.
in
this
case,
there
was
no
give
and
take.
it
was
five
years.
are
you
willing
to
take
five
years
between
two
and
ten
and
that
is
only
a
sentence
recommendation
in
kentucky.
there
is
not
even
a
right
in
kentucky
to
withdraw
your
plea
if
the
judge
does
not
follow
the
prosecutor’s
recommendation.
so
he
was
asking
paul
lewis
hayes
to
give
up
all
of
his
constitutional
rights
for
a
possibility
of
still
gaining
absolutely
no
sentence
reduction.
then
when
he
did
not
accomplish
that,
he
said
“i
will
go
higher.
i
will
raise
the
stakes
against
you
until
i
put
you
in
a
position
that
you
are
going
to
plead
guilty”
although
he
misunderstood
paul
lewis
hayes.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
obviously,
there
is
a
real
question
raised
as
to
whether
or
not,
in
view
of
your
trilogy,
brady,
mcmann,
and
that,
if
you
inject
the
defense
attorney’s
aid
and
assistance
into
that
bargaining
under
that
situation
then
he
enters
a
guilty
plea,
it
may
very
well
be
that
whatever
coercion
exists
there
could
be
cut
off
in
a
guilty
plea.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
as
i
stated
in
my
brief,
i
believe
that
there
is
a
distinct
possibility
that
under
mccree
brady
v.
united
states
where
you
noted
that
cognizable
claim
would
be
generated
by
a
threat
of
additional
prosecutions,
that
indeed
it
may
very
well
be
that
in
this
circumstance
you
would
have
a
coerced
guilty
plea.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
it
would
still
be
open,
your
honor.
that
is
true
and
a
counsel
may
or
may
not
have
been
sufficient
to
cut
that
coercion
off.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
no,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
i
think
the
sixth
circuit
addressed
this
quite
clearly
and
perhaps
it
has
been
a
mistake
on
my
part
to
not
point
this
out,
but
always,
the
prosecutor
is
allowed,
as
under
your
decisions
in
blackledge
and
north
carolina
v.
pearce
to
demonstrate
changes
that
account
for
why
he
did
not
obtain
the
original
indictment.
in
the
case
you
have
given
me,
the
hypothetical,
he
would
not
have
been
able
to
originally
indict
on
those
charges.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
that
would
be
perfectly
acceptable
because
the
original
indictment
could
not
have
anticipated
the
subsequent
conduct
like
your
u.s.
v.
paige
analogy
in
north
carolina
v.
pearce.
the
one
point
i
would
make
ultimately
is
that
in
brady
v.
united
states,
mr.
justice
white,
you
stated.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
i
am
sorry,
that
is
correct.
the
statement
was,
in
brady,
we
find
no
threats
being
made
between
the
time
the
man
initially
pled
not
guilty
and
he
changed
his
plea
to
guilty,
no
threats
being
made
to
him
in
a
face-to-face
confrontation
with
the
authorities.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
yes,
your
honor,
because
of
what
we
asked
for
in
a
way
of
the
prophylactic
rule
where
the
sixth
circuit
recognized
that
there
would
be
an
apprehension
generated
in
--
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
yes
your
honor,
it
is
determinative
in
two
ways.
i
say
that
if
we
did
not
have
the
face-to-face
threat
stated
here,
we
would
not
have
actual
vindictiveness
and
we
would
only
be
able
to
succeed
on
our
relief
under
the
prophylactic
rule.
but
i
say
we
have
actual
vindictiveness
so
even
without
the
prophylactic
rule
we
can
succeed.
