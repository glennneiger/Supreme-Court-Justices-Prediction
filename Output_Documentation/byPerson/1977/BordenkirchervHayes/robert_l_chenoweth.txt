mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
the
petitioner
presents
to
your
honors
by
this
case
is
whether
an
indictment
under
a
habitual
criminal
statute
by
the
state
is
constitutionally
prohibited
when
it
is
brought
after
an
accused
has
rejected
a
plea-inducement
offer.
it
is
petitioner’s
position
and
submitted
that
it
should
be
the
position
of
this
court
that
the
prosecuting
procedure
used
in
this
case
does
not
violate
any
constitutional
rights
of
a
defendant.
the
record
in
this
case
is
a
simple
one
and
the
basic
facts
are
not
in
dispute.
of
importance
though,
i
believe,
is
that
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
had
overwhelming
proof
of
mr.
hayes’
guilt.
mr.
hayes
have
been
charged
with
a
substantive
offense
of
uttering
a
forge
instrument
which,
under
kentucky
law,
carried
a
possible
sentence
of
2-10
years
in
the
penitentiary.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
this
was
not
a
forgery,
your
honor.
this
was
uttering,
there,
being
a
difference
in
elements.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
yes,
your
honor,
it
was
$88.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
the
possible
penalty
range
for
that
substantive
offense
is
2-10
years.
this
is
under
the
law
as
it
existed
prior
to
our
kentucky
penal
code.
that
law
has
been
changed.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
the
prosecutor
offered
a
sentence
recommendation
to
mr.
hayes
of
five
years
on
this
uttering
charge.
this
offer
was
rejected,
although
mr.
hayes
was
advised
prior
to
the
rejection
that
an
enhancement
charge
could
be
brought
in
view
of
mr.
hayes’
two
prior
felony
convictions.
after
the
rejection,
the
prosecutor
did
go
back
to
the
grand
jury,
did
re-indict
so
as
to
include
in
the
indictment
an
enhancement
charge
and
the
original
substantive
offense
of
uttering
a
force
instrument.
the
petitioner
believes
that
it
is
important
in
this
case
to
consider
the
unique
character
of
an
enhancement
statute
as
it
relates
to
plea
negotiation.
this
court
in
oyler
v.
boles
indicated
that
an
habitual
criminal
enhancement
charge
does
not
create
a
separate
and
distinct
substantive
offense.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
at
the
time
that
the
plea
negotiations
were
going
on
at
a
pretrial
conference,
really
two
pretrial
conferences,
there
was
only
the
singular
substantive
offense
of
uttering
a
forged
instrument.
it
was
really
a
sentence
recommendation
possibility
and
that
there
were
no
other
charges
to
deal
with
at
that
time.
the
basic
plea-inducement
capability
at
that
time
really
was
a
sentence
recommendation.
the
enhancement
statute
does
not
constitute
a
substantive
offense.
i
think
that
is
very
critical
in
view
of
the
prosecutor’s
broad
discretionary
powers
in
deciding
whether
to
charge
and
what
to
charge,
and
especially
so
as
this
relates
to
the
national
interest
for
a
number
of
reasons
of
a
prosecutor
seeking
to
enter
into
plea
negotiations
with
the
criminally
accused.
this
case
then
involves
the
timing
and
the
scope
of
a
prosecutor
exercising
his
charging
discretion
when
the
possibility
of
an
habitual
criminal
charge
exist,
a
non-substantive
offense,
and
a
plea
negotiation
is
nevertheless
desirable.
now,
if
the
prosecutor
is
faced
with
facts
that
will
support
an
indictment
on
the
substantive
offense
and
a
non-substantive
enhancement
charge,
the
prosecutor
has
to
decide
whether
he
wishes
to
indict
the
accused
as
a
habitual
offender
and
if
so,
he
has
further
to
decide
whether
to
seek
an
indictment
on
that
habitual
criminal
statute
at
the
time
the
principal
offense
indictment
is
returned.
he
is
faced
with
that
kind
of
decision
when
he
has
the
facts
initially
before
him.
now,
it
may
be
that
the
prosecutor
will
decide
that
an
indictment
is
proper
under
a
habitual
statute,
but
since
the
prosecutor,
in
looking
at
the
facts
of
the
case,
has
determined
that
he
intends
to
offer
some
kind
of
plea-inducement
on
the
substantive
charge
that
he
would
decide
that
the
plea
negotiations
can
proceed
more
fairly
and
proceed
more
expeditiously
if
an
indictment
on
the
substantive
offense
only
is
sought
at
that
time.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
yes,
very
definitely,
if
i
understand
your
question,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
the
very
reason
that
a
prosecutor
will
come
to
that
kind
of
conclusion
when
he
has
those
facts
before
him
is
that
if
he
has
a
strong
case,
as
there
existed
in
the
hayes’
case,
he
has
to
realize
that
if
he
is
going
to
enter
into
any
kind
of
plea
negotiations
that
he
cannot
enter
into
plea
negotiations
if
there
is
an
habitual
charge
already
on
the
books.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
well,
he
has
to
be
willing
if
he
has
already
gotten
the
case
to
the
posture
of
having
an
habitual
charge.
he
is
going
to
have
to
be
willing
to
remove
that
habitual
charge
before
he
can
go
to
the
prosecutor
and
say
“i
am
willing
to
enter
into
plea
negotiations,”
because
no
defendant
is
ever
going
to
plead
guilty
to
a
charge
as
long
as
that
enhancement
statute
is
still
on
the
books.
it
will
still
continue
to
enhance
whatever
the
plea
arrangement
that
was
arrived
at.
so,
the
prosecutor
has
to
be
willing
if
that
indictment
on
the
habitual
charge
is
brought
in
the
beginning.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
because
if
he
brings
everything,
he
is
going
to
have
to
and
he
desires
to
go
forward
with
plea
negotiations,
he
is
bringing
an
element
into
the
negotiations
that
he
really
need
not
bring
and
that
is
the
habitual
criminal
indictment.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
that
is
really
so.
he
does
have
to
give
away
more.
he
has
to
say
to
that
defendant
“here
is
what
i
am
giving
to
you
and
the
first
thing
that
i
have
to
give
to
you
is
that
i
will
be
willing
to
go
to
the
court
and
move
to
dismiss
the
habitual
criminal
indictment.”
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
i
do
not
know
why
that
it
should
in
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
it
seems
to
me
the
type
of
thing
that
why
should
the
prosecutor
go
forward
on
a
non-substantive
charge
as
is
involved
in
this
case
and
indict
on
that
habitual
criminal
element
of
a
case
and
then
turn
right
around
and
be
willing
“i
have
got
it,
but
now
i
will
be
glad
to
give
it
away
if
we
will
go
forward
on
plea
negotiations.”
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
yes,
but
we
are
talking
at
that
point
in
time
of,
in
fact,
a
procedure
that
you
are
indicating
of
bringing
everything
in
the
first
instance
that
that
is
going
to
work
to
the
detriment
of
the
defendant,
not
the
prosecution.
if
the
prosecution
goes
in
and
indicts
on
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
very
definitely.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
sure,
they
understand
that
there
are
prior
felonies
in
existence,
but
i
think
we
are
talking
about
two
ways
to
get
to
the
same
point,
either
bring
them
from
the
beginning
and
be
willing
to
give
up
the
enhancement
if
you
are
going
to
go
forward
on
plea
negotiation
or
if
you
believe
that
there
is
a
reasonable
possibility
of
entering
into
plea
negotiations
and
arriving
at
a
plea
arrangement,
and
especially
you
are
going
to
feel
that
way
to
have
an
overwhelming
case
as
you
had
here
a
proof
of
guilt,
that
why
get
that
indictment
for
the
enhanced
offense
on
the
books
and
then
be
willing
to
turn
right
around
and
in
the
statement
of
one
writer,
give
the
sleeves
of
your
vest?
you
are
not
really
giving
the
defendant
anything.
you
have
to
get
rid
of
that
or
you
are
never
going
to
go
further
on
any
kind
of
plea-inducement,
whether
it
would
be
sentence
recommendations,
a
charged
dismissal,
or
having
a
lesser
included
defense
type
of
plea-inducement.
so
we
think
--
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
yes
mr.
justice?
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
yes,
there
is
to
my
knowledge
no
guidance.
the
courts
on
that
type
of
charge,
the
prosecutor
goes
to
the
court
and
that
charge
would
be
dismissed.
the
court
has
to
accept
the
motion.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
consent
of
court
to
the
extent
that
you
would
have
to
make
the
motion
and
an
order
would
have
to
be
entered.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
i
think
that
would
be
very
safe
to
say,
your
honor,
that
this
is
a
matter
within
that
discretionary
power
of
the
prosecutor
and
the
judge
is
not
going
to
tell
the
prosecutor
to
go
forth
--
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
this
is
so
upon
request
of
the
prosecutor.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
that
is
safe
to
say
that
the
judge
is
not
going
to
say
“prosecutor,
you
go
forward
with
that
what
you
do
not
want
to
go
forward
with.”
so
to
that
extent,
i
think
that
it
would
be
very,
very
rare
situation
where
that
would
be
denied.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
i
would
not
go
so
strongly
as
to
say
that.
no,
i
do
not
intend
to
say
that.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
sure,
that
there
would
exist
discretion
in
the
judge
to
say
to
the
prosecutor
that
“i
want
to
have
a
reason.
i
want
to
have
some
greater
showing
than
a
mere
--”
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
let
me
please
try
and
explain
that.
what
i
am
saying,
mr.
justice
stewart,
is
that
i
think
in
almost
all
situations
it
would
be
plainly
a
pro
forma
type
of
response
of
the
court.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
the
judge
does
have
to
pass
on,
yes.
so
to
that
extent,
it
is
with
the
consent
of
the
court,
but
i
cannot
conclusively
say
that
there
could
never
be
a
possibility
of
the
judge
denying
it.
i
cannot
say
that
he
has
no
choice,
but
to
grant
it,
but
he
is
going
to
and
the
history
would
bear
out
that
he
has.
i
have
never
known
of
a
situation
of
a
judge
ever
denying
a
motion
to
dismiss,
but
i
think
under
some
circumstances,
i
cannot
begin
say
that
--
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
can
very
conscientiously
say
that.
i
have
never
seen
a
judge
refuse
a
motion
by
a
prosecutor.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
no,
your
honor,
i
can
say
that.
i
have
never
heard
of
it
either.
in
this
case,
the
prosecutor
did
make
the
decision
to
go
on
the
substantive
charge
of
uttering
only,
made
the
offer
of
a
sentence
recommendation,
and
at
the
same
time
or
at
that
time
of
plea
negotiation
at
the
pretrial
conference
did
inform
mr.
hayes,
as
of
course
mr.
hayes
knew
that
he
had
two
prior
felonies,
that
he
could
back,
that
it
was
an
alternative
to
go
back
and
get
the
enhancement
statute.
mr.
hayes,
faced
with
that
with
counsel
present,
chose
to
exercise
his
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
rights,
chose
to
plead
not
guilty
and
rejected
the
pro-offer,
negotiated
arrangement
of
the
prosecutor.
i
think
that
in
this
situation
we
have,
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit,
we
have
a
situation
of
a
court
having
said,
recognizing
that
there
are
two
ways
to
get
to
the
same
point.
that
if
you
do
it
one
way
that
that
is
vindictive
that
that
is
in
violation
of
constitutional
rights,
but
if
you
do
it
the
other
way
it
is
not.
by
that,
we
are
saying
that
if
you
indict
in
the
beginning
on
the
substantive
offense
and
the
enhanced
charge
and
then
go
to
the
defendant
and
say
“i
got
it
a
minute
ago.
now,
i
am
willing
to
move
to
dismiss
it
if
we
can
enter
into
some
kind
of
plea
negotiation.
if
not,
we
will
go
forward
into
trial
with
the
enhancement
on
the
books
which
could
subject
you
to
life
if
you
had
two
prior
felony
convictions.”
that
is
an
accepted
plea
negotiation,
an
accepted
offer,
but
in
a
face,
as
in
this
case,
overwhelming
charges,
if
you
believe
that
a
plea
arrangement
can
be
entered
into
and
you
go
only
on
the
substantive
offense
while
informing
that
the
alternative
does
exist,
that
you
then
after
the
plea
is
rejected
you
go
forward
and
do
that
which
is
legally
permissible
by
the
prosecutor
to
go
back
to
the
grand
jury,
that
that
is
vindictive
that
that
is
in
violation
of
the
due
process.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly,
we
are
talking
about
completely
unrelated
offenses,
not
arising
out
of
the
same
conduct.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
no,
i
am
not
saying
that
is
okay.
i
am
not
saying
that
that
is
really
an
aspect
of
this
case
at
all.
i
think
it
is
a
very
indifferent
consideration.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
no,
i
do
not
find
pressure
as
being
in
violation
of
due
process
at
the
plea
bargaining
stage.
i
think
the
very
nature
of
the
plea
negotiation
stage
of
the
pretrial
stage
recognizing
the
adversary
nature
of
the
prosecution
--
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
i
think
and
certainly
we
recognize,
as
this
court
recognized,
as
mr.
chief
justice
burger
indicated
in
the
santobello
case,
there
are
limits.
it
is
not
a
carte
blanche
and
we
do
not
begin
to
argue,
would
we
argue
if
those
were
the
facts
before
us,
that
a
prosecutor
has
absolute
carte
blanche
to
do
whatever
he
wishes,
including
physical
pressure.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
i
think
that
is
very
legitimate
plea
negotiation.
what
we
are
talking
about
in
the
language
of
some
commentators
to
this
area
is
what
is
called
horizontal
overcharging.
that
is
really
what
we
are
talking
about
when
we
have
different
substantive
offenses
that
do
not
relate,
or
maybe
they
do
relate,
but
a
prosecutor
has
that
discretion
to
decide
what
to
charge.
really
in
a
strong
case
he
is
going
to,
in
many
instances,
charge
initially
on
those
things
that
he
feels
that
he
will
be
able
to
best
negotiate
a
plea
of
guilty
for.
but,
at
that
point
in
time
before
we
have
ever
gone
to
the
trial
process,
i
think
that
those
kinds
of
additional
substantive
offenses
is
legitimate
coercion,
if
you
will,
if
that
is
the
term,
that
has
been
used,
i
think
that
is
legitimate
coercion
because
the
very
nature
of
the
proceedings
at
that
point
in
time
with
the
prosecutor
having
really
an
overwhelming
amount
of
discretion.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
yes,
i
understand
that.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
that
there
cannot
be
that.
there
are
people
that
would
like
to
say
that
the
plea
negotiation
process
has
no
place
in
our
criminal
justice
system.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
yes,
that
may
be
so,
but
yet
and
still,
clearly
to
say
that
there
are
people
having
different
viewpoints
on
various
aspects
arising
out
of
it
--
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
sure.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
we
would
be
very,
very
foolish
to
say
otherwise
of
course.
the
united
states’
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
in
deciding
that
one
way
is
violation
of
due
process
rights
and
the
other
is
not,
based
its
decision
in
great
respect
on
the
decisions
on
this
court
in
north
carolina
v.
pearce
and
the
blackledge
v.
perry
cases.
it
seems
that
by
citing
those
cases
and
applying
the
rationale
of
those
cases
that
the
sixth
circuit
seemed
to
forget
that
the
prosecutor
is
the
natural
adversary
of
the
defendant
and
that
the
prosecutor
has
to
consider
society’s
interest
in
handling
criminal
cases.
now,
this
case,
the
hayes’
case
is
simply
not
one
which
should
be
controlled
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
pearce
and
blackledge.
petitioner
urges
that
there
should
be
no
extension
of
that
prophylactic
rule
of
the
pearce
and
blackledge
case.
we
think
that
the
distinguishment
is
that
in
plea
negotiation
there
is
some
burden
constantly
existing.
there
is
some
chilling
of
constitutional
rights
constantly
going
on.
that
is
just
part
of
the
plea
negotiation
at
the
pretrial
stage
of
a
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
of
course.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
very
much
so,
except
that
the
prosecutor
probably
has
an
unequal
amount
of
power
at
that
stage.
he
really
has
more
probably
at
his
disposal
than
a
defendant,
because
a
defendant
basically
only
has
this.
he
has
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
sixth
amendment
and
he
will
either
exercise
those
or
not.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
sure.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
those
are
factors
of
that
enter
into
the
very
decision
of
the
prosecutor
to
select,
to
go
forward
with
some
kind
of
plea
negotiation
hoping
to
get
a
plea
arrangement.
as
this
court
has
indicated,
there
certainly
is
no
constitutional
right
to
have
plea
negotiations
entered
into.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
yes,
that
it
is
not
per
se
unconstitutional
while
recognizing,
in
response
to
mr.
justice
marshall,
that
there
are
limits.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
sure,
there
can
be
an
abuse.
but
we
are
saying
that
this
at
a
plea
negotiation
stage
the
difference
between
what
we
are
talking
of
and
what
the
court
is
talking
of,
what
you
are
speaking
of
in
the
opinions
in
north
carolina
v.
pearce
and
the
blackledge
v.
perry
case
and
the
opinions
of
the
court,
is
that
the
aspects
of
the
trial
of
a
right
of
appeal
or
exercising
that
nature
of
right
that
there
should
be
no
chilling
effect
on
that
stage.
it
should
go
forward
really
almost
in
a
vacuum.
if
something
does
enter
into
it,
a
presumption
would
enter
in
that
there
has
maybe
been
a
vindictive
and
the
mere
fear
of
vindictiveness
because
that
should
go
forward.
the
prosecutor
at
that
stage
should
be
virtually
an
impartial
officer
of
the
court
at
that
time
and
not
have
an
interest
of
that,
but
at
the
plea
negotiation
stage,
in
the
very
nature
of
that
process,
you
do
have
a
chilling.
it
is
already
there.
no
matter
what
kind
of
plea-inducement
that
may
be
given,
that
chilling
effect
is
there.
whether
the
defendant
wants
to
partake
of
that
negotiated
plea
or
not,
he
is
going
to
and
if
he
decides
not
to
irrespective
of
the
plea
negotiation,
he
is
going
to
be
faced
with
the
fact
that
probably
if
he
rejects
the
recommendations
of
the
prosecutor
that
he
if
he
goes
to
trial
the
likelihood
is
that
he
will
get
a
greater
sense
for
having
gone
to
trial
than
what
it
would
have
been
had
he
accepted
some
kind
of
arrangement.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
i
believe
not
because
the
same
possibility
is
going
to
exist
if
the
prosecutor
in
the
very
beginning
indicts
on
that
substantive
offense
in
the
non-substantive
offense
enhancement
and
says
“i
am
willing
to
give
that
up.”
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
five
years
recommended,
2-10
on
the
substantive
charge
of
going
to
trial.
so
there
is
that
difference,
but
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit
indicates
that
the
point
in
time
is
the
important
critical
factor
and
i
am
saying
that
it
does
not.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
i
think
there
are
limits,
but
i
do
not
think
that
is
one
of
them
because
if
we
are
talking
about
that,
which
is
not
an
aspect
of
this
case,
but
certainly
an
aspect
of
plea
negotiation,
we
are
talking
about
that
possibility
of
bringing
multiple
substantive
offenses
by
their
sheer
number
and
offering
to
enter
into
a
plea
negotiation
for
a
plea
of
guilty
on
only
one
of
those,
but
that
is
a
possibility
the
prosecutors
have
utilized
often.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
i
think
unrelated
substantive
offenses
or
they
may
be
related,
but
separate
elements
substantive
offense.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
that
is
the
concern
of
plea
negotiation
period.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
sure.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
where
do
you
draw
the
line?
i
cannot
say.
in
this
case,
i
can
certainly
say
that
you
do
not
draw
the
line
between
points
in
times
in
which
you
make
that.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
it
is
very
difficult.
there
is
such
a
range
of
plea
negotiation
possibilities
that
we
could
down
to
line
of
those
ranges
and
offer
various,
what
might
be
considered,
limits,
but
i
certainly
am
not
prepared
in
this
case
to
talk
about
the
full
ambit
of
plea
negotiation
possibilities
and
the
discretionary
power.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
there
is
some
limit,
but
there
is
not
a
limit
in
this
case
with
the
facts
that
we
are
talking
about.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
i
will
say
that.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
that
is
correct,
santobello
is
the
very
prime
example
of
that.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
blackledge
v.
allison
case
written
by
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
as
you
indicated,
your
honor,
in
the
allison
case
is
that
we
are
just
getting
this
plea
negotiation
thing
out
on
the
table,
so
to
speak.
we
are
just
starting
to
look
at
it
and
your
honor
says
“bring
it
out”
and
that
you
do
have
to
consider,
but
at
this
point
in
time,
our
guidance
from
your
honor
on
plea
bargaining
is
that
if
you
make
promises
whether
it
is
one
attorney
in
the
attorney
general’s
office
or
another
one
in
santobello,
keep
your
promise.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
mr.
chief
justice
very
much
indicated
that
there
was
and
i
think
we
go
back
to
mccree
brady
which
your
honor
also
wrote,
that
we
talk
about
that.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
fair
bargaining,
that
exactly
is
what
we
say.
clearly,
here,
it
is
fair
bargaining.
it
is
within
the
nature
of
the
plea
negotiation
process.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
very
definitely
so.
while
these
are
arguments
for
that,
the
disproportion
argument
type
of
argument
has
been
presented
in
some
of
the
lower
federal
courts,
heart
v.
coroner,
that
you
have
really
minor
felony
convictions
if
you
will,
i
do
not
know
what
minor
is,
but
that
is
an
argument
that
has
been
presented
by
defense
counsel
that
to
have
these
minor
felony
convictions
and
although
you
have,
say,
four
of
them
that
then
the
prosecutor
goes
forward
and
indicts
on
multiple
felony
offenses
irrespective
of
their
weight
and
then
goes
forward
in
the
possible
punishment
if
convicted
on
that
last
crime,
last
felony
is
life
in
the
penitentiary.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
by
a
virtue
of
a
persistent
felony
offender,
habitual
offender
type.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
of
course,
always.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
well,
the
american
bar
association
standards
very
definitely
say
“yes,
you
have
counsel
there
when
you
enter
into
plea
negotiations”
and
i
think,
yes,
that
is
one
of
the
hallmarks
of
a
prosecutor
that
he
does
want
to
do.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
coerced
from
the
standpoint
of
the
procedure
that
was
used.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
yes,
and
again,
i
had
a
great
deal
of
trouble
with
that
word
“coercion”
from
the
standpoint
of
the
types
of
procedure
that
we
are
dealing
with
here
versus
the
way
i
see
coercion
when
we
are
talking
about
what
mr.
justice
stewart
is
discussing
and
which
was
discussed
in
santobello
where
you
have
physical
coercion
or
overbearing
mental
coercion.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
because
if
he
does
that
he
is
doing
a
vain
act,
he
is
really
performing
a
charade.
he
is
going
to
the
grand
jury
and
he
says
“i
am
going
to
get
the
habitual
indictment
in
addition
to
the
substantive
offense
that
he
is
there
for
in
the
first
place,”
but
yet
because
of
the
nature
of
the
case
that
i
have
before
me,
i
find
it
advantageous
for
society’s
interest
that
i
want
to
enter
into
a
plea
negotiation.
so
he
goes
to
the
grand
jury
and
he
asked
to
turn
it
around
and
move
to
dismiss
that
if
he
is
going
to
go
forward
on
plea
negotiation.
why
should
he
do
that?
that
is
our
very
point.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
but
i
think
that
that
is
an
incorrect
conclusion
that
you
make
the
decision
as
a
prosecutor
when
you
are
faced
with
an
enhancement
possibility
on
a
substantive
offense.
that
if
you
do
not
indict
in
the
very
beginning
on
the
enhancement
statute
that
you
had
made
the
decision
that
the
crime
is
not
bad
enough,
for
this
is
not
someone
that
we
have
an
obligation
to
society
because
of
the
prior
felonies.
here,
we
had
two
prior
felonies
within
a
10
or
11-year
period
of
time
with
five
of
those
years
having
been
in
the
penitentiary.
that
does
not
preclude
the
mere
fact
you
do
not
bring
it
in
the
first
instance.
it
does
not
preclude
the
fact
that
that
prosecutor
has
on
his
mind
that
if
he
cannot
enter
into
a
plea
negotiation
in
view
of
the
overwhelming
evidence
that
he
should
not,
in
the
interest
of
the
society,
then
indict
for
the
habitual
felony
offender
so
that
the
punishment
that
the
statutes
authorize
should
be
placed
in
case
for
consideration
by
a
jury.
thank
you,
your
honors.
