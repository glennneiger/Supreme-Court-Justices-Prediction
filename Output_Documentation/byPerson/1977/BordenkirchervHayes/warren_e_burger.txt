we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
bordenkircher
against
hayes.
mr.
chenoweth,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
aprile?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
what
you
are
saying
is
that
any
inducement
automatically
becomes
virtually
a
threat
and
a
vindictive
action?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
i
think
misrepresentation
is
not
the
word.
that
is
the
way
i
take
your
argument?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
it
ends
up
to
is
that
when
inducements
are
offered,
if
they
are
rejected,
they
are
converted
into
threats?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
not
true
of
every
other
plea
bargain
and
it
fails?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
one
district
recently
a
study
showed
that
there
were
great
many
cases
where
additional
crimes
were
committed
while
the
defendant
was
released
on
his
own
recognizance.
six
different
charges
ultimately
had
accumulated
by
the
time
they
came
to
trial
on
the
first
one.
would
all
that
you
have
been
saying
apply
equally
to
subsequent
crimes
committed
repeatedly
after
the
defendant
was
released
on
bail?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
not?
the
charge
is
still
there.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
might
have
been
able
to
get
the
indictments
on
the
other
charges
before
they
reach
the
point
of
plea
negotiations?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgments
and
opinion
on
the
court
in
76-1334
bordenkircher
against
hayes
would
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
stewart.

justice

you
