rehnquist
let
me
interrupt
you
just
a
second,
if
i
may,
general
chenoweth.
in
the
course
of
a
plea
bargaining,
did
the
prosecutor
offer
to
drop
any
of
the
charges
or
simply
to
make
a
sentence
recommendation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
chenoweth,
is
it
not
one
of
the
consequences
of
a
habitual
offender
statute
the
fact
that
the
crime
which
finally
brings
the
person
within
the
terms
of,
say
a
four-time
offender
statute
itself
may
carry
a
fairly
light
sentence,
whereas
the
habitual
offender
statute
simply
by
virtue
of
the
number
of
crimes
may
carry
a
very
severe
sentence?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
by
virtue
of
a
habitual
offender?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
we
uphold
the
sixth
circuit
here,
every
prosecutor
faced
with
the
situation
as
this
one,
this
is
going
to
indict
for
both
the
latest
substantive
offense
and
a
habitual
offense
and
the
defendants
are
not
going
to
be
better
off?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
here,
just
a
minute.
the
habitual
offender
charge
here
certainly
could
not
be
rationally
found
to
be
overcharging?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
am
sure
he
can.
why
should
a
constitutional
principle
turn
on
whether
he
chooses
to
indict
on
both
offenses
first
and
then
give
up
the
bigger
one
at
the
conclusion
of
a
plea
bargain
or
indict
only
on
the
substantive
offense
first
and
then
if
the
plea
bargain
fails,
indict
on
the
larger
one?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
is
strictly
a
question
of
appearances?
