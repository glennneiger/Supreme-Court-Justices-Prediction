mr.
barnett
when
did
he
become
liable
for
this?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
wasn't
he
liable
when
he
first
took
over?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
much
funds
are
there
now
?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
see
the
difference
expect
that
he
gets
caught.
you
couldn't
have
then
said
you
are
about
to
be
bankrupt,
so
you
put
the
money
in.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
his
money
got
involved
when
corporation
went
bankrupt.
justice
thurgood
marshall
automatically.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
couldn't
do
all
three?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
couldn't
do
all
three,
he
couldn't
collect?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
can
collect
the
tax
withhold
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
didn't
he
pay
all
from
the
time
he
took
over?
didn't
he
paid
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
did
not
collect
anything
that
he
didn't
pay
over.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
correct?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
no
(voice
overlap)
as
a
fact.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
whatever
he
collected
as
taxes,
he
paid
over.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
so
there
is
no
way
that
he
can
collect
the
other
money
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
just
trying
to
be
as
technical
as
you
are?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
makes
a
lot
of
it
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
talking
about
the
clear
language
of
the
code.
the
clear
language
as
i
read
it
is
they
envisioned
one
person
doing
all
three
things.
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
mean
that's
what
they
were
talking
about
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
if
you
have
a
corporation
where
one
man
is
in
this
responsible
position,
he
takes
all
the
money
and
instead
of
putting
it
in
the
banks,
the
corporation's
bank
account,
he
puts
it
in
his
bank
account
and
then
he
is
succeeded
by
another
man
and
you
know
this
fact
and
you
go
after
the
second
man
and
don't
even
look
at
the
first
man,
is
that
what
the
statute
envisioned?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
what
the
statute
envisioned?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
he
has
money
in
his
own
bank
account.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
and
then
the
company
goes
broke
bankrupt,
can
you
go
after
this
man?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
second
man
did
not
misappropriate
any
funds.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
no.
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
what
was
done
right
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
far
as
we
know
somebody
stole
this
money.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
instead
of
trying
to
find
that
out
you
just
take
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
only
thing
that
happened
to
the
record
as
you
found
one
person
that
had
no
money
to
pay
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
only
thing
your
record
shows
is
that
you
have
one
man
that
could
pay.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
you
found
one
man
that
you
could
try
to
collect
from.
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
congressman.
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
he
couldn't
get
credit?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said
he
was
paying
the
cod
that's
what
the
petitioner
says
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
petitioner
is
not
complaining
about
going
out
of
business
or
the
bankruptcy,
he
is
complaining
about
you
putting
your
hand
in
his
pocket.
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
there
when
there
is
specific
crime
for
not
paying
over
withholding
taxes?
