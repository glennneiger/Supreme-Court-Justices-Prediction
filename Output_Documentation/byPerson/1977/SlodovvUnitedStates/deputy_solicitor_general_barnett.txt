mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
answer
is
that
the
record
is
entirely
silent
on
the
question
of
whether
the
government
did
or
did
not
pursue
the
predecessors
in
this
case.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
well
the
government
takes
the
position
your
honor
as
was
stated
in
the
sotelo
argument
this
morning
that
it
never
will
collect
more
than
a
100%
of
the
taxes
due
and
thus
the
government
would
not
go
after
the
predecessor
and
the
successor
and
try
to
get
more
than
100%.
now
whether
the
government
has
an
obligation
to
go
after
the
predecessor
first
just
because
the
predecessor
was
there
first,
i
doubt
that.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
as
between
the
predecessor
and
the
successor
they
maybe
as
matter
of
private
law
between
those
parties,
but
we
will
say
that
under
the
internal
revenue
code
each
is
liable
to
the
government
and
the
government
like
any
creditor
who
has
two
debtors
liable
for
the
same
debt
can
take
its
choice
i
should
think
as
to
which
one
to
go
after
first,
so
long
is
it
does
not
collect
more
than
the
total
from
both
of
them.
there
are
a
few
aspects
of
the
fact
here
which
--
well
the
facts
are
undisputed,
i
believe
deserve
brief
emphasis.
first
of
all
it
is
undisputed
that
after
petitioner
purchased
the
stock
of
the
three
corporations
as
of
january
31,
he
was
there
after
in
complete
control
of
the
corporations
for
the
relevant
period.
it
is
also
undisputed
that
one
petitioner
took
control
of
the
corporations,
he
knew
that
the
withholding
taxes
in
question
here
had
previously
been
withheld
from
the
employees'
wages
and
were
due
to
the
government.
this
fact
is
unusually
clear
here
because
immediately
after
taking
control,
petitioner
sent
off
to
the
internal
revenue
service,
corporate
checks
for
this
withholding
taxes.
two
days
later
he
discovered
that
there
was
no
money
in
the
bank
to
cover
those
checks
and
he
immediately
stopped
payment
on
them.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
well,
simply
that
it
makes
quite
clear
that
he
knew
of
the
liability
and
thus
it
could
not
be
suggested
--
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
--
of
the
corporation's
liability,
yes.
the
third
which
has
been
--
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
well
his
duty
at
that
point
and
thereafter
was
when
the
corporation
came
into
funds
--
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
it
isn't
a
question
of
a
$100
--
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
that
was
his
statutory
liability
before
--
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
no
the
government
didn't
assert
that
position
to
him.
in
fact
the
record
shows
that
the
amount
that
came
in
every
week
during
his
tenure
was
a
$130,000
that
came
in
per
week
and
was
deposited,
so
we
are
not
talking
about
$100,
but
the
government,
it
is
true
mr.
justice
stevens,
apparently
did
not
tell
him
you
have
got
to
pay
us
everything
first
on
pain
of
going
out
of
business.
the
internal
revenue
service
in
these
cases
is
flexible.
it
would
rather
keep
the
business
going
if
possible,
so
that
eventually
it
could
collect
the
taxes
due
from
the
corporation
rather
then
from
an
individual,
but
if
bankruptcy
does
ensue,
the
government
has
recourse
under
section
6672
to
collect
it
from
the
individual
who
was
responsible,
who
did
make
this
choice
to
try
to
keep
the
business
going
rather
then
pay
the
government.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
yes.
well
he
is
stickable
originally
as
well.
it
isn't
is
if
he
is
more
stickable
in
bankruptcy
than
he
is
as
soon
as
he
comes
into
control
and
as
soon
as
money
is
available
that
would
cover
the
liability
to
the
government
which
he
applies
to
corporate
--
to
other
corporate
debt
instead.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
well,
that
is
his
statutory
liability.
if
he
makes
the
choice
to
--
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
well,
in
a
sense
it's
a
hobson's
choice.
the
cases
have
dealt
with
this
problem
and
have
may
clear
that
while
the
statute
may
seem
harsh,
the
statute
is
designed
to
protect
the
revenue
to
make
sure
that
these
taxes
owing
are
collected.
now
after
all
the
corporation
was
benefiting
from
these
withheld
taxes.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
well
that
is
true,
but
it
is
not
asserted
there
that
was
any
agreement
on
the
part
of
the
government
that
if
you
carry
the
business
on
we
will
absolve
you
of
the
statutory
--
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
well,
as
soon
as
he
had
money
available
that
would
have
paid
the
government
he
was
under
the
duty
to
pay
the
government
first
and
if
that
required
litigation
--
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
yes.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
because
he
is
liable
only
for
a
willful
failure
you
to
do
that.
a
willful
failure
--
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
yes,
but
a
willful
failure
means
that
you
prefer
other
creditors
--
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
well,
the
cases
are
clear
on
the
meaning
of
willful
that
it
means
you
have
to
have
a
choice,
you
--
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
oh,
no!
you
have
to
have
a
choice
out
of
corporate
assets.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
that's
right
it
is
after
all
a
corporate
tax.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
yes.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
the
record
doesn't
indicate
that.
the
record
indicates
that
it
has
substantial
income.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
i
don't
know
the
record
doesn't
indicate
it.
it
is
the
corp
--
i
think
the
answer
is
that
it
is
a
corporate
tax
and
he
has
to
truthfully
account,
he
has
to
fail
to
collect,
truthfully
account
for
and
pay
over
such
tax
and
therefore
he
is
liable
only
when
the
corporation
has
money
which
he
diverts
to
another
purpose
other
then
paying
taxes
--
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
he
became
liable
when
the
corporation
obtained
sufficient
funds
that
would
have
paid
the
tax
liability
and
he
decided
not
to
use
them
for
that
purpose.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
because
the
corporation
at
that
point
did
not
have
sufficient
funds
to
pay
the
taxes
--
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
the
bankrupt
now,
i
assume
it
has
none.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
well,
we
couldn't
have
said
that
he
must
put
it
up
out
of
his
money
at
that
point,
but
once
he
had
corporate
money
available
--
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
when
the
corporation
went
bankrupt
he
becomes
liable
under
6672
?
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
--
because
he
was
the
person
in
control
of
the
corporation
who
willfully
failed
to
have
the
corporation
pay
its
taxes
and
he
did
that
by
having
the
corporation
use
the
corporate
funds
and
prefer
other
creditors
over
the
government
with
those
funds.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
technically
as
matter
of
statutory
liability,
yes.
now
in
practice
the
service
is
willing
to
go
along
in
hope
that
the
corporation
will
make
it,
but
he
had
to
make
--
he
could
have
made
that
choice
--
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
yes
and
the
cases
are
clear
on
that.
for
example,
the
monday
case
cited
at
page
19
and
20
of
our
brief,
the
court
there
had
charged
the
jury
that
willful
under
the
statute
means
that
you
fail
to
pay
the
tax
without
justifiable
excuse
or
without
reasonable
cause.
this
charge
was
held
to
be
error,
because
it
invites
consideration
of
such
misleading
and
improper
factors
as
the
financial
condition
of
the
business
or
the
demands
of
the
creditors.
the
muller
case
cited
in
our
brief
at
page
12
held
?absence
stringent
measures
to
protect
these
funds,
they
might
easily
be
available
to
finance
a
business
and
has
it
is
or
failing
condition.?
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
--
and
so
forth,
there
are
others.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
yes,
well
that
--
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
no
i
haven't
had
an
opportunity
to
mr.
justice
white,
i'll
try
to
now.
under
the
language
of
the
statute,
section
6672,
which
appears
in
appendix
to
our
brief,
the
crucial
language
is
any
person
required
to
collect,
truthfully
account
for
and
pay
over
and
pay
over
any
tax
imposed
by
this
title
willfully
fails
to
collect
such
tax
and
so
forth.
now
petitioner
reads
this
to
me
that
the
person
has
to
be
required
to
collect,
truthfully
account
for
and
pay
over
particular
tax
moneys
and
thus
he
argues
that
here
the
petitioner
was
required
as
he
concedes
to
pay
over
these
taxes
after
the
commissioner
came
in
--
after
the
petitioner
came
into
control
of
the
company,
but
was
not
required
to
collect
them
originally
and
therefore
is
not
covered
by
this
language.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
with
respect
to
taxes
that
accrued
after
he
came
into
control
--
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
yes.
now
we
say
as
matter
of
both
the
language
and
the
purpose
of
the
statute
and
the
authorities
the
statute
does
not
mean
that.
what
it
means
is
that
petitioner
here
at
the
time
he
--
after
he
took
over
the
corporations
was
as
he
concedes
the
responsible
officer,
that
is
he
was
required
to
that
time
and
thereafter
to
collect,
truthfully
account
for
and
pay
over
any
tax
impose
by
this
title
i:e
or
e.g.
the
withholding
taxes
of
income
and
social
security
taxes
that
are
imposed
by
this
title
on
the
corporation.
he
was
required
continually
to
pay
those
taxes
for
the
corporation
and
he
failed
to
truthfully
account
for
and
pay
over
those
taxes,
the
particular
ones
that
had
previously
been
collected.
that
is
the
reference
to
any
tax
imposed
by
this
title
and
the
subsequent
reference
back
in
a
word
such
tax
is
to
a
generic
tax,
the
withholding
tax.
it
is
not
to
particular
tax
dollars.
support
for
this
incidentally
can
be
found
in
the
words
of
the
statute
itself
in
another
section,
if
one
looks
at
section
6671(a)
which
is
printed
in
our
--
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
at
page
1(a)
right
over
6672,
in
6671(a)
the
final
sentence
reads
except
as
otherwise
provided
any
reference
in
this
title
to
tax
imposed
by
this
title
shall
be
deemed
also
to
refer
to
the
penalties
and
liabilities
provided
by
the
sub-chapter.
now
the
purpose
of
this
section
of
course
is
not
relevant
here.
the
purpose
of
this
section
is
to
equate
taxes
with
penalties.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
i
think
it
does
answer
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
we
contend
that
he
was
required
after
he
took
control
of
the
corporations
to
collect,
to
truthfully
account
for
and
to
pay
over
the
corporations'
withholding
taxes,
the
generic
withholding
taxes,
so
he
was
required
to
do
all
three
and
we
are
not
saying
that
and
should
be
read
as
or.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
well
that
goes
back
to
the
other
point
and
whether
he
used
to
be
--
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
well,
he
could
collect
withholding.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
well,
if
you
read
it
as
tax
withholding
taxes,
our
reading
is
that
it
means
withholding
taxes
continually.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
he
paid
most
of
those,
the
record
appears
to
indicate,
but
our
argument
--
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
all
right!
that
--
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
that
is
correct
if
you
read
tax
as
the
particular
dollar.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
he
did
not
--
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
yes.
that
is
correct
--
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
i
think
that
is
correct,
but
our
reading
of
the
statute
--
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
there
is
no
way
that
he
could
collect
the
earlier
money,
but
the
statute
doesn't
require
that
he
had
been
in
the
position
to
collect
the
earlier
money.
the
statute
talks
about
the
generic
withholding
tax,
it
identifies
the
person
--
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
well
we
were
only
trying
to
as
technical
as
petitioner
actually,
but
--
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
yeah.
but
if
you
get
back
to
point
i
was
trying
to
make
was
section
6671(a)
may
illustrate
this
what
is
relevant
about
6671(a)
we
would
submit
is
the
way
it
uses
the
phrase
tax
imposed
by
this
title,
the
same
phrase
in
6672.
the
context
in
6671(a)
where
taxes
are
equated
with
penalty
indicates
we
suggest
that
the
congress
is
talking
there
about
tax
impose
by
this
title
in
the
generic
sense
of
a
whole
tax
or
withholding
tax,
not
in
the
sense
of
particular
text
money.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
yes.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
oh,
yes!
but
that
would
not
to
be
covered
under
6672
because
people
are
now
required
to
collect
truthfully
--
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
i
don't
think
it's
required
by
the
internal
revenue
code
to
collect
the
tax
from
the
corporation.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
well
if
it
--
i
don't
think
there
is
that
requirement
to
collect,
but
if
it
would
we
will
take
the
same
position
that
he
is
the
person
required
to
--
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
no
one
for
the
past
period,
but
we
do
not
agree
that
this
refers
to
the
past
period.
we
read
this
as
meaning
collect,
truthfully
account
for
and
pay
over
at
a
particular
point
in
time
and
he
was
required
to
do
all
three
with
respect
to
the
continuing
ongoing
withholding
taxes
after
he
took
over.
the
problem
--
the
basic
problem
here
mr.
justice
stevens
is
that
you've
got
an
inevitable
time
lag
between
the
time
of
withholding
and
the
time
that
the
taxes
are
paid
over
to
the
government.
now
petitioner's
argument
that
you
have
to
be
--
that
the
person
to
be
liable
under
6672
has
to
be
required
to
collect,
truthfully
account
for
and
pay
over
with
respect
to
particular
dollars
would
mean
that
whenever
there
was
a
change
in
who
was
the
responsible
person
that
neither
of
them
can
be
liable,
because
neither
the
first
guy
nor
the
second
guy
is
required
to
do
all
three
as
to
particular
dollar.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
well,
yes,
but
his
answer
is
i
am
afraid
--
he
is
not
correct.
he
relies
on
these
cases
of
teal
and.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
and
we
read
them
differently.
it
seems
to
us
that
they
support
--
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
well,
but
those
positions
say
--
those
cases,
particularly
teal
and
tiffany
--
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
well,
yes
and
teal
and
tiffany
so
hold,
but
our
position
is
that
supports
our
argument
because
the
only
basis
on
which
they
could
so
hold
the
only
basis
on
which
the
predecessor
can
be
held
liable
when
in
fact
he
was
not
around
at
the
time
of
paying
over
must
be
that
our
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
correct
otherwise
those
cases
would
have
to
be
decided
differently.
petitioner
in
his
brief
quotes
from
the
teal
case
at
page
--
excuse
me!
where
did
it
go,
at
page
10
of
petitioner's
brief
where
the
taxpayer
in
teal
had
made
the
argument
that
he
could
not
be
liable
for
the
taxes
accrued
during
the
month
of
november,
because
by
the
time
it
was
time
for
those
taxes
to
be
paid
over,
a
receiver
was
there
and
he
therefore
was
not
required
to
pay
them
over.
now
that's
exactly
the
converse
of
petitioner's
argument
and
if
petitioner
is
right
that
all
three
requirements
must
converge
than
this
taxpayer
would
have
won,
but
the
taxpayer
lost
and
the
reason
must
be
that
our
interpretation
is
correct
that
the
taxpayer
in
teal
was
required
to
do
all
three
generally
with
respect
to
the
withholding
taxes.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
but
unfortunately
we
see
no
support
for
that.
petitioner
says
that
might
be
a
--
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
well,
i
think
it
perhaps
is.
petitioner
says
well
maybe
this
person
would
be
liable
under
the
trust
law,
but
he
was
held
liable
here
under
the
internal
revenue
code
and
we're
not
--
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
how
is
he
require
to
pay
over
when
the
time
that
those
taxes
are
required
to
be
paid
over
has
not
yet
come?
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
you
see
we
think
that
the
--
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
well,
that
might
be
a
nice
liberalization
of
the
statute,
but
we
think
that
on
petitioner's
reading
all
three
requirements
did
not
converge
in
the
case
of
the
predecessors
there
and
yet
they
were
held
liable
under
the
internal
revenue
code,
not
under
some
trust
law.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
well,
yes.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
yes,
but
not
in
respect
to
particular
dollars.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
no,
no
i
must
disagree.
i
say
that
one
person
who
is
in
--
the
responsible
officer
for
the
corporation
to
do
all
three
with
respect
to
any
tax
imposed
by
this
title
--
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
well,
we
are
assuming
that
--
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
no,
you
are
assuming
that
the
second
man
has
funds
available,
has
corporate
funds
available,
to
pay
the
taxes.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
no,
it
has
to
be
corporate
funds.
it
would
not
be
willful
failure
to
pay
the
corporate
tax
unless
they
were
corporate
funds.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
what
if
he
diverted
corporate
funds
to
creditors
other
than
the
united
states
knowing
of
the
obligation
to
the
united
states
--
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
but
he
did
divert
corporate
funds
to
other
creditors.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
then
he
did
not
willfully
fail.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
no.
well,
then
he
did
divert
corporate
funds
to
other
creditors
that's
what
happened
here.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
and
here
the
corporation
was
getting
--
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
well,
that
maybe.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
we
have
no
evidence
in
the
record
mr.
justice
marshall
in
the
case
so
we
did
not
try
to
find
that
out.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
we
don't
know
we
didn't
try
to
find
the
other
guy.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
we
don't
know
that
he
can
pay
it.
all
we
know
is
that
the
corporation
--
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
yes,
but
we're
doing
it
on
the
basis
that
the
corporation
--
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
yes.
the
corporation
had
money
coming
in
which
would
have
paid
the
federal
taxes
and
this
man
in
charge
of
the
corporation
decided
to
pay
other
creditors
instead.
the
metropolis
industries
that
mr.
justice
stewart
referred
to
before
was
a
creditor
who
was
paid
a
$100,000
in
the
first
week
of
february
here
at
the
time
that
the
petitioner
come
in
the
control
of
the
corporation,
that's
at
the
page
3
of
our
brief.
that
is
what
gives
rise
to
the
liability
--
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
we
don't
why
it
is,
the
record
does
not
indicate
--
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
well
the
record
doesn't
indicate
why
that
loan
was
paid,
but
as
those
cases
indicate
the
cases
are
clear
that
the
fact
that
you
might
have
to
go
out
of
business
if
you
don't
pay
the
debt
to
the
government
is
not
an
excuse
for
liability
under
the
statute.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
because
he
when
in
control
of
the
corporation
and
when
the
corporation
had
money
available
that
would
have
paid
the
government
decided
to
pay
other
people
instead,
that
is
why.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
well,
mr.
justice
powell
one
thing
we
don't
think
we
have
to
relay
on
7501
since
the
language
of
6672
is
clear,
but
in
addition
it
is
not
the
case
as
petitioner
claims
that
there
is
no
law
that
supports
the
notion
that
the
trust
still
exists
even
though
the
money
has
been
dissipated.
the
court
below,
in
fact,
dealt
with
a
case,
the
teal
case,
which
is
law
on
that
point.
at
page
56
of
the
appendix,
quoting
from
the
teal
case,
the
court
of
appeals
quoted
the
--
that
as
the
cash
went
into
the
cash
drawer
it
became
subject
to
trust
or
lien
in
favor
of
the
federal
government
for
the
unpaid
withholding
taxes.
by
dissipating
the
cash
for
new
purchases
of
which
the
taxpayers
knew
they
unwillingly
supplied
the
necessary
willfulness.
we
would
contend
that
that
case
for
one
does
support
the
notion
that
the
trust
still
exists
even
though
the
initial
trustee
has
dissipated
the
actual
dollars.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
well,
that's
a
conclusion
of
law
i
would
suggest.
we
would
say
that
--
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
now
there
is
no
requirement
under
section
7501
of
segregation
that
the
employer
segregate
the
money
being
withheld.
it
is
--
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
apparently
it
has
not
been
so
construed
but
i
--
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
well,
i
was
too
a
corporate
officer,
but
apparently
the
legal
authorities
have
not
viewed
it
that
way.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
well
i
don't
know.
there
is
a
criminal
statute
that
would
be
relevant
here,
section
7202
the
criminal
--
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
well,
it's
a
counterpart
to
6672,
it
might
be
applicable
here,
but
the
government
did
not
proceed
under
criminal
statute
of
course.
now
whether
there
is
a
criminal
statute
that
simply
says
anyone
who
violates
any
trust
imposed
by
the
internal
revenue
code
is
liable
under
that
code,
i
don't
know
whether
there
is,
i
tend
to
doubt
it.
i
tend
to
think
that
this
--
that
petitioner's
suggestion
that
the
only
way
the
predecessor
responsible
officer
in
the
teal
situation
can
be
reached
is
under
some
vague
trust
law
is
something
that
the
government
--
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
that's
7202
which
is
the
criminal
counterpart
of
6672.
we
are
not
trying
to
get
a
criminal
convection
here
in
which
case
there
might
be
different
requirements
of
willfulness,
i
don't
know.
we
are
simply
proceeding
under
a
civil
statute.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
well,
i
think
it
would
be
rather
helpless
under
petitioner's
--
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
well,
lien
had
accrued,
i
am
talking
--
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
yes
i
think
that's
true.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
i
assume
that's
true.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
yes,
but
exercising
(voice
overlap)
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
--
prefer
to
see
the
corporation
--
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
well
they
could
protect
themselves.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
yes.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
well,
yes
that's
what
they
do
in
practice
or
what
they
apparently
did
here,
but
they
made
no
agreement
here
it
is
not
asserted
here
that
they
made
any
agreement
that
they
would
not
--
that
they
would
absolve
the
petitioner
of
the
liability
for
this
if
the
petitioner
--
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
well,
that's.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
well
that's
right
and
that's
what
congress
had
in
mind
here,
because
otherwise
there
would
be.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
and
that
the
fact
that
the
government
takes
a
risk
in
a
situation
like
this
doesn't
mean
that
6672
liability
doesn't
not
apply
--
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
it
can't
get
it
from
the
person
in
charge
after
all.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
yes
and
one
might
well
assume
that
the
government
would
have
a
better
chance
to
get
it
from
those
first
bills
that
came
into
the
corporation
and
from
the
individual.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
the
government
did
not,
he
doesn't
claim
to
the
government
made
any
such
express
agreement
here.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
i
think
that
will
be
different
case
if
it
were
claimed
that
the
government
had.
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
without
that's
simply
is
not
claimed
to
be
the
fact
here
mr.
justice
--
mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
barnett
i
think
that
will
be
an
interesting
case
in
the
estoppel
of
government
and
well
the
government
can
be
equitably
estopped.
thank
you
my
time
is
up.
