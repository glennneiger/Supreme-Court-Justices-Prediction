justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kleinman,
if
i
understand
the
government's
theory
correctly,
every
dollar
that
came
in
after
the
takeover
would
have
been
impressed
with
this
trust.
now
that
if
any
money
was
used
to
pay
wages
or
rent
or
the
light
bill
or
anything,
it
would
have
been
a
violation
of
the
trust,
is
that
a
correct,
i
mean
do
i
correctly
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
this
record
show
whether
they
ever
objected,
they
were
aware
what
was
going
on
i
guess,
did
they
ever
object
to
paying
ordinary
expenses
of
operations
during
the
period.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
record
show
whether
they
made
any
effort
to
collect
from
prior
individual
officers
of
the
corporation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
barnett
what
was
his
duty
at
that
point?
justice
john
paul
stevens
say
he
get
a
$100
check
and
he
had
a
employee
there
or
into
$100
in
wages,
he
should
not
have
paid
the
employee
and
given
all
of
that
money
to
the
government?
justice
john
paul
stevens
every
cent
that
came
in
should
have
immediately
been
turned
over
to
the
government,
is
that
your
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
the
government
ever
assert
that
position
to
him?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
barnett
why
do
you
say
as
soon
as
he
had
money
available,
i
take
it
that
you
mean
as
soon
as
the
corporation
had
money
available.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
does
that
affect
his
personal
liability?
what
--
under
your
theory
if
i
read
the
statute
your
way
10
minutes
after
he
took
over
he
became
a
person
required
to
account
for,
collect
and
pay
over
whatever
the
words
are,
why
wasn't
he
immediately
liable
for
the
full
amount?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
he
established
he
knew
about
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
is
nothing
about
preferring
other
creditors
in
word
willful
as
i
understand
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
had
a
choice
he
had
personal
assets
he
could
have
used.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
statute
doesn't
say
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
barnett
this
was
a
corporation
with
substantial
assets,
was
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
fixed
\assets
and
he
had
the
wherewithal
to
liquidate
and
pay
that
debt
right
away,
he
didn't
have
to
wait
for
incoming
receipts,
did
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
generate
income
of
$130,000
a
month
wasn't
it
and
you
say
there
were
no
assets
to
do
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
barnett
the
word
title,
it
just
occurred
to
me,
doesn't
have
to
refer
the
whole
internal
revenue
code?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
would
include
corporate
income
i
suppose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
the
treasury
of
the
corporation
isn't
required
to
collect
and
pay
over
the
corporation's
income
tax?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
just
occurred
to
me,
it
seems
to
me
your
reading
would
impose
personal
liability
on
the
officer
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
from
whom
was
doctor
slodov
required
to
collect
a
tax
for
the
past
period
before
january
31,
1969.
justice
john
paul
stevens
his
answer
to
that
is
that
if
he
is
collected
and
accounted
for
it
he
has
an
ongoing
obligation
to
be
sure
it
is
paid,
so
there
is
an
obligation
on
him.
justice
john
paul
stevens
tiffany,
teal
and
tiffany.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
cases
say
you
could
certainly
--
you
could
read
the
statute
the
way
you
want
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
feel
sure
if
the
government
had
that
problem
with
the
person,
say,
you
had
the
predecessor
before
you,
i
am
sure
the
government
would
be
asserted
that
the
predecessor
had
an
obligation
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now
his
argument
is
that
specifically
he
was
required
to
be
sure
the
taxes
which
he
had
collected
and
accounted
for
got
paid?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
am
saying
as
your
the
interpretation
isn't
a
necessary
one
to
reach
the
contrary
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
(voice
overlap)
law
you
are
again
talking
about
successor.
now
directly
attention
to
the
predecessor
you
can
read
the
statute
as
requiring
all
three
elements
and
say
the
predecessor
who
has
collected
and
accounted
for
has
an
additional
liability
to
pay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
time
of
payment
is
one
thing
the
liability
for
making
sure
that
there
is
a
payment
is
another
thing.
that's
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
you
opponent
would
answer
you
before
and
after
cases
well
as
this
one
by
emphasizing
the
word
willfully
in
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
on
your
after
situation
we
didn't
know
what
happen
later
it
could
be
willfully.
