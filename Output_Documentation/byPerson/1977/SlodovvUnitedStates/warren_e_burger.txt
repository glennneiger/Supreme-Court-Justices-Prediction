e.

we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
1835,
slodov
against
united
states.
mr.
kleinman
you
may
proceed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
anytime
after
he
took
over
did
he
ever
have
control
its
funds,
when
any
fund
for
the
purposes
involved
in
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
kind
of
an
account,
you
said
all
the
bank
accounts
were
drawn
to
zero.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
there
a
segregated
account
for
these
funds
at
anytime
prior
to
his
take
over?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words
they
took
the
money
from
the
employees
and
just
put
it
into
general
revenues
of
the
corporation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
how
long
a
period
did
that
go
on?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
the
interpretation
you
have
just
given,
the
distinction
between
and/or
is
the
distinction
the
fifth
circuit
made.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
the
net
of
your
argument
is
no
matter
how
the
sotelo
case
comes
out
your
case
is
a
different
kind
of
a
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
factually
different?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
factually
different?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you
wish
to
save
any
time
for
rebuttal
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
you
can
do
that.
mr.
barnett
at
sometime
at
your
own
convenience,
i
wish
you
would
indicate
whether
there
is
an
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
pursue
the
predecessors
of
dr.
slodov
and
if
the
record
shows
anything
about
pursuant
to
them
went
that
out.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
if
you
would
at
some
point
pursue
whether
there
is
an
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
pursue
them,
you
don't
need
the
record
for
that
purpose?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
isn't
there
--
if
there
is
any
default
here,
are
they
not
the
primary
defaulters?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
significance
should
we
attach
to
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
the
corporation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you
are
saying
is
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
are
you
saying
that
the
first
$177,000,
the
amount
that's
involved
here,
it
came
into
the
corporation
after
the
the
moment
of
his
take
over,
had
to
be
formal
right
to
the
government.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
there
--
i
think
it
there
is
no
criminal
statute
anywhere
that
imposes
criminal
sanctions
for
failure
to
--
trust
funds,
is
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
applicable
to
this
petitioner
or
to
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
nay
thing
further
mr.
kleinman?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
funds
were
available
because
they
had
withheld
them
from
the
employees.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
no,
but
after
he
came
on
he
continue
to
withhold.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentleman
the
case
is
submitted.
