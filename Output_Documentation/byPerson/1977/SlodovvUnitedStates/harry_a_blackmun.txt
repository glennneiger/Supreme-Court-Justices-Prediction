let
me
ask
in
another
way,
these
funds
are
not
available
at
that
time
were
not
encumbered
otherwise?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
then
i
take
it
that
there
was
some
net
income
realized
too?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
then
i
take
it
your
answer
to
one
of
the
earlier
questions
is
that
he
did
not
give
first
priority
to
the
hold
withholding
taxes
because
he
had
to
pay
cod
for
everything?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
placing
him
in
a
terrible
dilemma,
if
you
let
him
go
along
and
he
goes
under
bankruptcy
then
you
are
sticky?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
then
it
is
your
position
that
he
should
liquidate
immediately?
justice

choice
you
have
given
