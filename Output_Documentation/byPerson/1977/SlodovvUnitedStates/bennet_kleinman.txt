mr.
bennet
kleinman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
case
before
us
is
slodov
versus
the
united
states
and
comes
to
this
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
under
provisions
of
66
--
section
6672
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
the
section
incidentally
which
was
discussed
in
the
immediately
preceding
case,
whether
under
that
section
of
the
code
or
any
other
section
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
dr.
slodov,
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
is
personally
liable
for
income
taxes
and
social
security
taxes
withheld
from
employees
of
a
corporation
withheld
prior
to
the
time
that
he
became
a
responsible
officer
under
the
previsions
of
the
section
and
which
taxes
were
not
paid
over
to
the
internal
revenue
service
by
the
corporation.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
so
far
as
the
petitioner
is
concerned
the
petitioner
slowed
off,
came
into
no
funds
when
he
took
over
the
corporation.
the
day
he
took
over
control
of
the
corporation
the
bank
accounts
or
all
the
bank
accounts
of
the
corporation
had
been
overdrawn.
there
was
no
--
mr.
bennet
kleinman
at
that
time
even
at
the
time
--
mr.
bennet
kleinman
corporation
had
gross
income
that
was
correct.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
no.
so
far
as
we
are
concerned
it
was
not
subject
--
it
was
subject
let
me
put
it
this
way.
the
corporation
obviously
--
mr.
bennet
kleinman
that's
correct.
the
corporation
remained
liable
for
that
tax
liability
throughout
the
entire
proceeding
--
mr.
bennet
kleinman
he
could
have.
that
is
correct.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
the
funds
which
came
into
the
corporation
after
the
petitioner
took
over
were
not
encumbered
expect
for
the
fact
that
the
corporation
and
the
fact
so
indicates
was
required
to
pay
cod
for
any
inventory
which
it
had
purchased
which
incidentally
gave
rise
to
the
gross
income
of
the
corporation.
so
that
had
he
not
paid
these
bills
for
inventory
which
he
was
buying,
not
pay
them
simultaneously
he
would
have
had
no
income,
nothing
to
sell
and
therefore
no
money
out
of
which
--
mr.
bennet
kleinman
i
am
not
aware
whether
a
text
lien
had
been
placed
upon
the
assets
of
the
corporation.
i
do
not
believe
that
they
were
your
honor.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
i
do
not
believe
there
was
any
net
income.
in
fact
the
corporation
went
bankrupt
within
6
months
after
the
time
dr.
slodov
took
over
control
of
the
corporation.
it
was
in
very
bad
financial
condition
at
the
time
he
took
over.
there
was
no
net
income
otherwise
there
would
probably
not
have
been
any
need
for
the
corporation
to
go
through
the
bankruptcy
proceeding.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
it
is
part
of
our
argument,
yes
your
honor,
but
it
is
also
part
of
our
argument
that
there
was
no
obligation
on
anyone's
part
to
give
priority
to
those
payments
of
taxes
out
of
funds
which
were
acquired
by
the
corporation
at
a
later
date.
there
is
nothing
in
section
6672
nor
section
7501
of
the
internal
revenue
code
which
are
the
only
two
sections
which
i
know
of
by
which
this
petitioner
could
be
how
liable
for
the
tax
which
gives
the
government
any
priority
over
subsequent
funds.
section
7501
which
provides
for
at
least
funds
to
be
held
in
trust,
says
that
the
funds
that
are
with
held
and
collected
the
tax
withheld
or
collected
are
held
in
trust.
those
funds
had
dissipated
by
prior
officers
of
this
corporation
before
perhaps
dr.
slodov
had
even
heard
of
this
corporation,
certainly
before
he
took
control
on
january
31.
there
was
no
money,
there
were
no
funds
representing
withheld
taxes
at
the
time
he
took
over.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
overdrawn,
overdrawn.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
so
far
as
the
record
shows
no
funds
had
ever
been
segregated,
which
had
been
withheld
or
collected
--
mr.
bennet
kleinman
that
is
correct.
as
far
as
the
record
shows
that's
what
happen,
yes.
they
used
the
funds
as
they
came
in
--
mr.
bennet
kleinman
well
this
went
on
for
a
quite
a
period
although
the
taxes
with
which
we
are
involved
here
are
the
few
quarters
before
the
time
that
dr.
slodov
took
over.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
there
were
no
funds
available
and
that
is
clear
from
all
of
the
evidence
the
court
found.
originally
this
case
was
tried
in
the
bankruptcy
court.
the
bankruptcy
judge
found
that
the
bank
accounts
had
all
been
overdrawn.
he
found,
the
bankruptcy
judge
found,
this
defendant
or
this
petitioner
not
liable
for
any
taxes
which
had
been
collected
or
withheld
prior
to
the
time
he
took
over
control
of
the
corporation.
there
was
an
appeal
to
the
district
court
and
the
district
court
likewise
held
this
petitioner
not
liable
for
those
taxes.
the
court
of
appeals,
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
reversed.
the
basis
on
which
the
two
lower
courts
had
held
that
this
petitioner
was
not
liable
for
the
tax
was
that
the
three
requirements
of
making
him
a
responsible
person
insofar
as
these
particular
taxes
are
concerned
had
not
converged.
that
is
to
say
section
6672
provides
that
any
person
required
to
collect,
truthfully
account
for
and
pay
over
to
tax,
all
three
of
these
provisions
are
required
before
a
person,
even
though
a
responsible
officer
at
that
time,
can
be
held
liable
for
any
taxes
which
should
have
been
collected.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
yes.
we
concede
that
your
honor
we
have
no
argument
with
the
fact.
there
was
an
issue
in
the
original
case
as
to
whether
there
was
any
liability
on
his
part
for
taxes
incurred
after
he
became
the
responsible
officer.
that's
been
settled
--
settled
to
his
--
mr.
bennet
kleinman
we
concede.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
correct.
he
was
that
person
from
the
time
he
took
over.
we
do
not
concede,
however,
that
he
was
a
responsible
office
for
the
period
prior
to
that
and
that's
what
the
issue
is
before
this
court
at
the
present
time.
the
government
reads,
the
internal
revenue
service
and
government,
and
the
sixth
circuit
read
this
statute
differently
from
the
way
it
is
clearly
written.
now
they
said
that
any
person
required
to
collect,
truthfully
account
for
or
pay
over
any
tax,
the
statute
says
and
pay
over.
the
two
decisions
in
the
lower
courts
were
that
these
three
had
to
converge.
they
did
not
converge
because
the
petitioner
was
not
the
responsible
officer
who
was
required
to
collect
these
taxes
for
which
the
government
is
now
making
a
claim.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
fifth
circuit
like
wise
made
the
same
distinction.
the
government
made
the
same
argument
in
the
fifth
circuit.
they
said
this
should
be
read
or
and
the
fifth
circuit
clearly
said
that's
fine
expect
the
principal
difficulty
with
this
argument
is
that
that's
not
the
way
the
statute
is
written
and
there
is
no
statutory
authority
for
the
collection
of
this
penalty.
that
is
the
basis
for
at
least
in
one
part
of
our
case
where
there
is
a
conflict
between
the
sixth
circuit
and
fifth
and
the
sixth
circuit
clearly
said
that
they
don't
follow
the
reasoning
of
the
fifth
circuit
insofar
as
section
6672
is
concerned.
the
--
mr.
bennet
kleinman
the
fifth
circuit
didn't
reach
that
point
and
specifically
said
that
they
don't
--
mr.
bennet
kleinman
the
sixth
circuit
said
--
the
sixth
circuit
said,
as
i
understand
there
decision
that
when
funds
came
in
afterwards
not
collected
or
withheld,
but
as
in
this
case
from
wending
machines,
from
catering
fees,
from
whatever
the
gross
income
was
that
some
how
a
trust
was
engrafted
upon
those
funds,
so
that
his
violation
of
those
requirements
to
hold
those
funds
or
pay
them
over
to
the
government
somehow
made
them
--
made
him
liable,
that
is
this
petitioner
liable
for
those
taxes.
the
court
cites
no
law
which
would
indicate
that
there
was
a
trust
of
after
required
funds.
the
trust
under
section
7501
provides
those
taxes
required
to
be
collected
shall
be
held
in
trust,
in
a
fund
in
trust
for
the
government.
this
money
that
came
in
afterwards
even
if
it
had
been
free
and
we
don't
concede
that
point
and
that
maybe
an
issue,
if
this
court
holds
as
sixth
circuit
did,
it
maybe
an
issue
as
to
whether
there
were
any
free
funds
available
and
how
much
those
were
and
to
what
extent
he
could
be
liable
for
those
free
funds.
however,
it
is
our
contention
that
there
is
no
basis
in
any
of
the
decided
cases
and
several
other
circuit
court
--
or
district
court
cases
have
held
that
somehow
the
minute
a
dollar
came
in
regardless
of
the
fact
that
it
didn't
come
in
from
withholding,
the
minute
it
came
in
and
went
into
the
cash
drawer,
it
became
impressed
with
the
trust.
none
of
the
cases,
which
we
have
read,
would
indicate
what
the
basis
for
that
determination
is.
there
just
is
nothing
in
section
6672,
or
section
7501
which
are
the
only
two
sections
we
know
of
whereby
this
party,
this
petitioner
could
be
personally
liable
for
corporate
debt.
we
read
the
statute
strictly
because
normally
an
individual,
an
officer
of
a
corporation
is
not
liable
for
the
debts
of
the
corporation
as
of
course
this
court
is
well
aware.
it
is
only
where
there
is
some
statutory
provision
such
as
this
that
a
person
becomes
personally
liable,
and
the
statute,
to
us
is
perfectly
clear
as
to
who
that
person
is.
the
congress
has
cast
a
net
to
attempt
to
protect
the
revenue
so
that
the
person
responsible,
the
individual
responsible
for
the
collection,
if
he
doesn't
collect
or
doesn't
pay
it
over
shall
become
personally
liable,
but
we
suggest
that
the
sixth
circuit
and
the
internal
revenue
service
has
cast
to
broad
a
net.
they
are
seeking
other
persons
from
whom
to
collect
the
tax
for
which
this
person
had
no
responsibility,
i
might
suggest
to
the
court
that
even
the
internal
revenue
service
itself
was
not
consistent
in
stating
that
the
funds
as
they
came
in
were
impressed
with
the
trust.
the
record
is
clear
and
the
appendix
filed
in
this
case
will
indicate
that
the
internal
revenue
service
insisted
during
the
entire
time
that
they
were
attempting
to
collect
this
past
due
tax
during
the
six
months
when
doctor
slodov
was
in
charge
of
the
corporation.
they
insisted
that
as
funds
came
in
the
current
taxes
had
to
be
paid,
the
current
withholding
taxes,
not
the
past
taxes.
they
wanted
them
to
take
these
funds
and
pay
current
taxes.
now
if
those
funds
were
in
fact
impressed
with
the
trust
for
prior
collected
taxes
then
the
internal
revenue
service
would
have
insisted
that
that's
our
money,
should
apply
to
the
old
tax
and
not
be
applied
to
the
new
taxes,
but
it's
perfectly
clear
that
that
isn't
what
happened.
they
and
they
themselves
insisted
that
some
of
these
funds
if
there
was
a
diversion
of
money
that
came
in
which
we
of
course
do
not
admit,
if
there
was
a
diversion
it
was
the
requirement
not
only
with
the
consent
but
by
the
requirement
of
the
internal
revenue
service
that
current
taxes
be
paid
from
those
funds.
so,
that
there
was
no
trust
at
least
so
far
as
we
are
concerned
there
was
no
trust
on
those
taxes
for
prior
liabilities.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
i
understand
that
to
be
government's
position,
not
only
couldn't
you
pay
--
mr.
bennet
kleinman
no,
as
a
matter
of
fact
as
far
as
the
record
shows
and
i
think
the
findings
were
that
they
permitted
the
corporation
to
continue
to
do
business;
permitted,
in
fact
insisted
that
they
pay
not
only
the
salaries
and
other
debts
but
these
withholding
taxes
as
well,
and
in
fact
had
the
government
not
done
that,
had
they
insisted,
had
internal
revenue
insisted
and
said,
look
every
dollar
that
comes
in
from
here
on
has
to
be
applied
to
the
old
taxes
that
have
been
due
before,
the
corporation
would
have
seized
functioning
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
internal
service
would
have
been
further
behind
the
ball
than
they
were
because
there
would
have
been
no
more
money
coming
in
out
of
which
they
could
get
any
money
and
they
did
get
paid
every
single
dollar
of
withholding
taxes
for
which
this
petitioner
was
responsible,
from
the
day
he
took
over
until
the
corporation
went
into
bankruptcy
six
months
later,
every
dollar
that
was
owed
the
internal
revenue
service
for
withholding
and
social
security
tax
was
religiously
accounted
for
and
paid.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
the
record
is
not
clear
and
so
far
as
we
know,
they
have
not
at
least
been
persistent
in
attempting
to
collect.
i
am
not
even
certain
that
they
have
made
assessment
against
the
prior
officer
who
we
say
we
are
obviously
responsible
for
having
dissipated
funds
which
came
into
their
hands.
it
could
logically
be
argued
it
seems
to
me
that
had
there
been
fund
when
this
petitioner
came
into
the
corporation,
had
there
been
such
a
fund
under
the
general
rules
of
trust
law,
he
would
have
become
by
interpretation
thus
the
successor
trustee
of
that
fund
and
then
having
dissipated
he
would
perhaps
could
have
been
held
liable
for
dissipating
that
trust
fund.
on
the
other
hand
to
say
that
these
people
who
were
there
before,
the
responsible
person,
suppose
they
pay
the
employees
in
cash
and
said
now
give
me
back
the
withholding,
here
is
$10
give
me
a
dollar
and
they
put
it
in
their
pocket,
that's
certainly
the
tax
withheld
and
they
went
ahead
and
spent
that
money.
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
anyway
that
this
petitioner
should
be
responsible
for
funds
over
which
he
had
no
control
and
which
never
came
to
him.
and
there
is
i
suggested
to
the
court,
no
case
that
we
have
discovered
that's
been
decided
and
i
am
talking
about
those
cases
which
have
held
somehow
a
trust
applies
the
funds
as
they
come
in.
there
is
no
case
which
has
indicated
by
what
law
or
by
what
authority
they
have
come
to
this
conclusion.
they
are
bold
statements
which
say,
the
moment
another
dollar
came
in
it
was
impressed
with
the
trust.
even
however
i
suggest
to
the
court,
that
if
it
was
impressed
with
a
trust
under
the
provisions
of
7501,
there
is
nothing
in
7501
which
would
make
this
petitioner
liable
for
the
dissipation
of
those
funds,
but
we
can't
find
anything
in
the
law
anywhere.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
well
it
deals
with
the
same
sections
of
the
law,
but
it
is
a
different
case,
that's
true,
our
--
mr.
bennet
kleinman
pardon?
mr.
bennet
kleinman
factually
different,
yes.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
oh
yes,
yes.
sotelo
could
lose
and
we
could
win
because
we
are
dealing
in
sotelo
case
there
is
no
question
that
sotelo
was
the
responsible
officer,
during
the
period
when
the
taxes
were
collected
and
were
required
to
be
collected.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
and
when
the
trust
fund
was
paid
out,
that
is
correct.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
discharged
under
bank
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
now
it's
a
completely
different
issue.
this
has
to
do
with
whether
by
law,
not
by
fact
--
the
facts
are
found
and
are
determined
and
at
this
point
no
issue
can
be
taken
with
the
facts,
obviously
the
question
is
whether
by
law
he
falls
within
6672.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
whether
he
is
liable
in
the
first
instance
for
those
taxes
which
are
already
been
collected,
already
been
dissipated.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
that
wasn't
argued
in
sotelo,
no.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
metropolis
industries
may
have
been
one
of
the
creditors,
i
am
not
sure.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
well
yes,
i
might
point
out
that
the
three
corporations
were
joined
as
one,
because
the
issues
were
same
as
to
all
three,
there
happened
to
be
three
separate
corporations
all
of
which
were
controlled
by
doctor
soldov.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
i
don't
think
it's
relevant.
i
was
not
involved
in
the
earlier
trails
of
this
matter
your
honor,
but
--
so
that
under
6672
really
that
the
entire
issue
revolves
around
the
fact
of
whether
or
not
this
petitioner
is
a
responsible
officer
for
these
taxes
whether
and
in
order
to
find
him
liable
for
these
taxes
the
statute
would
have
be
read
with
an
or
instead
of
an
and
where
the
and
now
appears.
it
seems
perfectly
unambiguous
that
the
?and?
is
there
and
not
to
be
read
thus.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
then
his
obligation
if
the
court
please
would
be
under
the
provisions
of
the
general
trust
law
that
there
was
a
trust
fund
over
which
he
took
control
and
now
he
dissipated.
he
would
not
be
liable
under
6672,
because
he
was
not
the
responsible
officer
to
collect
and
withhold
those
taxes.
he
could
perhaps
as
i
suggested
be
held
by
reason
of
violating.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
once
you
have
determined
the
responsible
officer
then
when
he
fails
to
perform
any
one
those
acts,
he
is
liable,
but
to
hold
him
as
a
responsible
officer
the
statute
says,
any
person
required
to
collect,
truthfully
account
for
and
pay
over.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
no,
it
says,
or
who
fails
to
collect,
truthfully
account
for
or
paid,
but
we
are
talking
about
whether
he
is
the
person
that
they
are
referring
to.
they
say
any
person,
who
is
the
person.
the
person
is
the
one
required
to
collect,
account
for
and
pay
over.
those
were
the
officers
of
this
corporation
before
doctor
slodov
came
in.
all
three
of
requirements
converged
on
those
offices.
they
were
required
to
collect,
they
were
required
to
account
for
and
they
were
required
to
pay,
all
three.
once
they
are
determined
to
have
been
the
responsible
officer,
if
they
failed
to
do
any
one
of
those
things
in
the
disjunctive
admittedly
then
they
are
liable,
but
you
must
first
determine
whether
doctor
slodov
was
in
fact
that
person.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
any
person
required
to
collect,
truthfully
account
for
and
pay
over,
i
am
reading
from
the
statute,
any
tax
imposed
by
this
title,
willfully
fails
to
collect
such
tax,
or
truthfully
account
for
and
pay
over
such
tax.
in
other
words
once
you
have
established
that
the
individual
is
the
person
that
they
are
talking
about
is
the
one
who
was
required
to
collect,
account
for
and
pay.
and
he
fails
either
to
collect,
either
to
account
for
or
to
pay,
then
he
becomes
liable,
but
you
cannot
fine
the
individual
who
bares
this
responsibility
until
you
have
made
the
determination
that
all
three
of
these
requirements
were
met.
now
the
government's
argument
is
that
this
leads
to
strategic
shifts
which
could
avoid
liability
on
any
person.
for
example
an
individual
is
required
to
collect,
but
leaves
the
corporation
control
before
the
payment
date
for
the
tax.
now
they
say,
somebody
else
comes
in
and
is
only
required
to
pay
therefore
neither
one
of
them
have
all
three
obligations
at
any
one
time,
but
that
is
not
true
and
the
courts
in
the
teal
and
tiffany
cases
which
are
cited
in
our
brief,
have
indicated
that
the
party
required
to
collect
also
has
the
burden
of
accounting
and
paying
that
tax,
so
he
is
the
party
the
one
who
collects
it.
now,
it's
true
it
may
not
be
doing
payable
while
he
is
control,
but
he
has
means
of
protecting
himself,
he
can
put
it
into
separate
accounts,
he
can
pay
it
over
to
the
government
in
advance
so
he
can
make
arrangements
for
that
payment.
he
is
responsible
to
collect,
account
for
and
pay
over.
so,
all
three
of
the
elements
making
him
a
responsible
party
do
converge
if
he
is
required
to
collect,
but
if
he
is
only
required
to
pay
it
and
the
money
is
not
there
out
of
which
to
pay
it.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
no,
i
am
saying
he
could
be
liable
but
not
under
6672.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
would
not
be
liable,
under
the
statute,
under
6672.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
he
would
not
be
liable
under
6672.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
possibly
7501
more
than
likely
general
trust
provisions,
your
honor.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
combination
of
the
two.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
it
says
it
is
a
trust,
but
it's
the
trust
in
the
hands
of
the
employer.
then
it
does
not
provide
for
what
happens
if
it's
dissipated.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
if
they
were
there
and
he
dis.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
if
they
were
there,
he
would
be
liable.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
the
only
other
provision
that
could
be
was
7501
and
i
would
concede
that
there
is
an
argument
to
be
made.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
right
that's
correct,
that's
true.
that
would
be
the
basis
on
which
he
could
be
held.
now
i
believe
that
the
other
courts
with
i
think
with
the
exception
of
teal
perhaps
have
said
and
this
in
mccullough
case
in
the
fifth
circuit
the
court
said
we
do
not
reach
the
question
of
whether
there
would
be
a
liability
if
when
he
became
the
responsible
officer,
the
fund
was
there.
they
said
they
didn't
reach
that
point.
in
the
other
cases,
however,
they
had
loosely
combined
6672
and
7501
in
fact
mixed
them
up
to
first
decide
under
6672
there
is
no
liability,
but
then
there
is
a
trust
that's
created
on
these
additional,
on
the
new
funds
that
come
in
again
which
i
say
there
is
no
legal
authority
for
creating
such
a
trust.
the
government
is
attempting
to
give
them
some
priority
and
payment
out
of
moneys
that
were
not
in
the
trust
fund
to
begin
with
and
were
not
intended
under
6672
to
be
part
of
that
fund.
now,
under
section
7501
as
i
stated
there
could
be,
there
would
be
in
fact
the
trust
for
any
funds
collected
that's
what
the
statute
says
section
7501
says
there
is
a
trust
fund
for
taxes
withheld
and
collected
or
withheld
--
mr.
bennet
kleinman
yes,
he
was
a
we
concede
he
was
the
person
required
to
collect,
account
for
and
pay
over
the
taxes.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
from
then
on,
are
we
speaking
now.
the
government
seeks
to
do
--
mr.
bennet
kleinman
correct,
we
concede
that
he
was
a
responsible
officer
from
and
after
the
day
he
took
over
the
responsible.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
as
to
which
tax
your
honor,
the
government
seeks
to
mix
up
these
taxes.
we
are
talking
about
--
we
say
that
the
person
is
a
responsible
officer
as
to
a
particular
tax.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
such
tax,
the
tax
he
is
required
to
collect
the
withheld,
such
tax.
the
government
says
such
tax
means
any
tax
under
this
title.
the
fact
is
that
in
general
section
6672
deals
with
any
tax
under
the
title,
that's
the
general
parameter.
but
specifically
then
it
says
the
collected
tax,
you
must
use
the
word
collected
whether
otherwise
corporate
income
taxes
could
be
recovered
from
a
person
--
from
an
individual,
because
if
you
don't
relate
such
tax
to
collected
tax
then
the
corporate
income
tax,
the
corporate
share
of
the
social
security
tax,
any
other
federal
tax
which
is
not
withheld
or
collected
could
be
collected
from
the
individual.
i
don't
think
the
government
has
ever
taken
that
position
expect
that
it
appears
in
its
brief
when
it
serves
their
purpose
to
say
such
tax
does
not
being
collected
tax,
it
means
any
tax.
it
doesn't
mean
any
tax,
it
means
such
tax
that
is
the
tax
required
to
be
collected,
accounted
for
and
paid.
he
had
no
responsibility
with
such
tax,
only
the
tax
for
a
subsequent
period.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
yes
i
do.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
if
the
court
please,
in
terms
of
analysis
of
the
section
the
individual
petitioner
or
the
party
being
charge
its
charge
with
such
tax.
such
tax
is
the
tax
required
to
be
collected
by
him.
as
mr.
justice
stevens
said,
if
it
were
not
that
tax
then
the
individual
could
be
held
liable
for
corporate
income
taxes
and
every
other
tax
along
the
board
if
such
tax
only
meant
any
tax.
it
means
such
tax
means
any
tax
required
to
be
collected
by
him.
if
in
fact
what
the
government
says
is
true
it
doesn't
make
any
difference,
when
the
tax
accrued.
we
are
talking
about
tax
for
particular
period,
not
just
any
old
withholding
taxes.
if
in
fact
what
the
government
says
is
true
then
a
man
could
today
become
a
responsible
officer,
pay
every
dollar
he
owned,
leave
the
company,
the
next
people
did
not
pay
the
withholding
taxes
and
he
could
be
held
responsible
under
the
government's
interpretation,
because
one
time
he
was
a
responsible
officer.
they
said
that
all
three
of
those
things
did
converge
when
he
become
the
responsible
officer,
but
that
doesn't
mean
he
is
only
responsible
for
the
period
of
time
when
they
converged,
but
for
the
period
of
time
before,
well
if
before
why
not
after
and
i
suggest
you
that
this
is
not
what
was
intended.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
in
this
case
when
the
government
knew
that
the
tax
was
not
paid,
mr.
dr.
slodov
went
to
them
paid
the
tax
because
he
was
advised
that
funds
were
available
to
pay.
so
he
decided
that
if
the
funds
were
available
he
would
pay.
when
he
find.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
but
they
no
they
were
to
be
in
the
bank.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
i
am
not
talking
about
that
withholding.
when
he
brought
the
company
he
knew
that
there
was
a
withholding
tax
liability
of
the
company,
but
he
had
been
advised
by
the
seller
of
the
stock
to
him
that
the
money
was
in
the
bank
all
you
got
to
do
is
go
in
and
pay,
it
is
due
tomorrow,
you
are
going
to
write
the
checks
and
pay
the
money,
he
went
in
and
the
money
wasn't
there.
now
this
could
--
this
is
such
a
dangerous
thing
to
anyone
purchasing
stock.
it
would
seem
that
whether
he
knew
of
the
tax
or
not
or
whether
he
made
an
investigation,
he
could
of
have
had
the
accountants
in
there
for
months
and
not
known
that
the
government
would
come
in
at
later
date
and
say
that
these
people
whom
you
employee
and
whom
you
can
and
who
you
contend
are
independent
contractors
and
therefore
you
don't
withhold
or
in
fact
employees
and
you
should
have
withheld
and
if
he
did
not.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
well,
willfully
he
could
have
paid
it,
he
could
have
paid
the
money.
mr.
bennet
kleinman
now
but
the
willful
point
is
if
you
knew
the
tax
was
liable.
if
you
knew
there
was
tax
due.
remember
that
the
courts
have
interpreted
willfully
and
i
believe
wrongly
as
knowing
the
taxes
due
and
not
paying
it.
those
to
previsions
are
here.
as
to
subsequent
taxes
he
knows
that
they
got
employees
and
he
knows
they
are
withholding
taxes,
he
knows
it's
payable
and
he
doesn't
pay
it.
why
would
he
not
be
liable
under
the
government's
interpretation?
it
doesn't
make
sense
and
can't
be
there.
people
who
are
personally
liable
the
government
has
latched
on
to
the
wrong
individual
--
