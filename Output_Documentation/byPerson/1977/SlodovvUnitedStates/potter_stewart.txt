letter
was
filed
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
kleinman,
do
you
concede
that
mr.
slodov
--
dr.
slodov
during
the
period
of
his
control
of
the
corporation
which
were
few
months
in
1969
was
such
a
person?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
concede
that.
justice
potter
stewart
--
during
the
time
that
he
was
in
control
of
the
corporation
he
was
the
kind
--
the
person
described
in
6672?
justice
potter
stewart
then
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
went
on
to
explain
the
difference
between
this
case
and
the
fifth
circuit
case
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
they
were
after
acquired
assets.
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
talking
about
what
the
sixth
circuit
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
quite
a
different
issue,
the
sotelo
case
involves
whether
or
not
something
is
discharged.
justice
potter
stewart
this
doesn't
involve
the
bankruptcy
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
the
metropolis
industries,
is
that
involved
here?
justice
potter
stewart
i
will
find
that
--
there
were
three
corporations
here.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that's
about
the
metropolis
industries
thing
coming
up
that's
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
liability
would
be
what,
under
7501?
justice
potter
stewart
the
combination
of
the
two.
justice
potter
stewart
7501
says
it
is
a
trust
and
then
trust
law.
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
but
in
answer
to
let's
stick
with
my
brother
white's
question,
you
concede
that
the
new
comer
would
be
liable
if
the
funds
were
there
but
you
say
not
under
--
justice
potter
stewart
not
dissipated.
justice
potter
stewart
but
not
under
6672
you
insist
and
my
question
was
would
that
be
then
under
7501
and
you
say,
well
may
be.
justice
potter
stewart
7501
which
calls
it
a
trust
fund
and
then
you
import
general
principles
of
trust
laws,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
he
concedes
that
he
was
required
to
do
all
three
things
once
he
became
in
control
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
thereafter
but
he
simply
is
not
a
person
identified
in
6672
with
respect
to
taxes
that
were
collected
before
he
took
over.
