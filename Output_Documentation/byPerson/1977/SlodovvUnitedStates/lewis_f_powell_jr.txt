justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
barnett
you
said
a
little
while
ago
as
understood
you
that
the
case
had
to
be
decided
on
the
language
of
the
statute
and
i
think
we
all
agree
with
that,
that
section
7501,
oh
you
said
not
on
trust
law,
the
section
7501
and
you
and
others
have
to
guess
that
the
(inaudible)
amount
of
taxes
collected
is
to
be
held
in
special
trust
fund
and
one
of
the
problems
with
your
case
is
that
trust
fund
was
dissipated,
there
was
no
reece
left
at
the
time
of
acquisition
of
this
corporation
and
i
am
not
familiar
with
any
trust
law
that
requires
that
where
the
trustee
had
dissipated
the
funds
of
trust
someone
who
is
not
party
to
that
to
restore
them,
i
see
no
language
in
the
code
that
imposes
that
obligation.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
bankruptcy
judge
found
here
that
no
reece
existed,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
suggests
the
contrary.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
also
it's
a
matter
of
fact,
isn't
it
because
there
was
nothing
as
of
the
date
of
take
over,
that
could
be
identified
as
a
reece
of
the
statutory
trust?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
would
not
construe
the
language
requiring
that
the
funds
be
held
in
a
special
trust
to
require
segregation?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
our
corporate
officer
would
certainly
view
it
that
way?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
