did
have

that
the

has
some
gross
income
that
was
subject
to
liability
for
the
tax?

time
when
he
took
over,
did
the
corporation
has
some
gross
income?
justice
byron

white
which
was
subject
to
the
tax
liability?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
was
a
decision
to
face
and
build
besides
the
tax?
justice
byron

white
and
he
could
have
applied
that
money
to
the
tax
instead
of
some
other
liability?
justice
byron

white
had
a
lien
matured,
a
tax
lien

mr.
kleinman,
you
certainly
inferred
i
suppose
the
sotelo
could
win
and
irs
could
lose
and
you
could
win?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
when
the
so
called
trust
fund
was
paid
out.
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
he
is
liable
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
issue
was
?
that
wasn't
being
argued
in
sotelo.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
when
he
came
in
the
company,
the
company's
bank
accounts
were
in
d
order
and
the
so
called
trust
trend
was
intact?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
a
disjunctive
between
the
collect
and
the
accounting
and
paying
over,
it
is
an
or,
it
does
say
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
swell,
i
know,
it
says,
collect
or.
justice
byron
r.
white
no
but
you
would
say
even
if
the
money
was
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
that's
what
i
mean
under
i
mean
the
statute
he
would
not
be
liable.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
he
had
the
money
in
the
bank
when
he
came
in
and
dissipated
himself.
justice
byron
r.
white
when
your
client
came
into
the
company
was
he
a
person
who
at
that
very
moment,
was
he
from
then
on
was
he
required
to
collect
taxes?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
he
satisfies
that
for
sentence
of
the.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
as
of
that
time
he
does
satisfy.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
after
that
he
does
any
one
of
the
things.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
there
has
to
some
failure.
he
not
only
has
to
be
in
that
category
of
people
required
to
collect
and
pay
over,
but
he
has
then
to
pay
over,
he
has
to
then
locally
pay
over
and
collect,
locally
fail
to
the
account
for
or
willfully
fail
to
pay
over.
justice
byron
r.
white
at
the
time
he
has
to
go
--
he
has
to
be
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
say
it
is
his
risk,
if
he
uses
for
something
else
even
with
--
even
though
the
united
states
stands
aside
and
lets
him
do
it,
if
he
uses
for
something
else
that's
his
risk.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that
might
be
and
the
other.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
friend
might
agree
with
you
expect
that
his
position
is
that
he
never
does
become
liable
under
this
particular
statutory
section
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
pay
any
tax
that
had
accrued
prior
to
that
time,
you
haven't
addressed
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
barnett
just
to
make
clear,
the
government
in
this
situation
like
this
isn't
helpless
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
let's
assume
that
--
let's
assume
the
government
knew
what
was
happening
and
that
the
withholding
taxes
hadn't
been
paid
and
here
comes
a
new
man
on
the
horizon.
if
there
wasn't
--
had
a
lien
had
accrued
here,
hadn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it
hadn't
the
government
could
easily
have
perfected
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
with
respect
to
any
of
the
assets
of
the
corporation?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
was
in
position
to
tell
the
company
--
tell
the
company
and
i
know
if
you
are
as
money
comes
in
you
pay
it
over
because
we
have
a
lien
on
these
things
you
have
got.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
i
am
saying
is
--
all
i
am
saying
is
they
can
protect
themselves.
justice
byron
r.
white
first
1770000,
they
could
get
if
they
wanted
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
could
take
some
risk.
so
they
could
say
well
we
make
get
more
if
we
got
him
go
ahead
and
you
say
that's
what
they
really
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
certainly
if
they
had
lien
or
could
it
had
it
they
certainly
didn't
assert
it
with
respect
to
certain
moneys.
they
said
go
pay
your
bills,
don't
give
it
us
although
we
have
a
lien
on
it,
go
pay
somebody
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
you
are
saying
well
that
money
they
paid
out
the
risk
didn't
turn
out
and
we
are
going
to
collect
it
from
the
man
himself.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
a
question
--
the
question
is
whether
that's
one
thing
had
in
mind
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
can't
you
concede
that
it
shouldn't
be
interpreted
that
failure
to
pay
over
it's
a
government
says
you'll
go
ahead
we
are
waving
around
lien
pay
it
to
somebody
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
it
did?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
call
up
the
government
--
they
call
at
the
government
on
the
telephone,
the
government
on
the
telephone,
the
irs
says
here
is
our
situation
and
the
government
says
we
got
a
lien
on
a
every
dollar
you
get.
well,
alright
and
then
they
talk
for
a
while,
the
government
says,
well,
we
probably
going
to
get
along
better
if
we
rock
along,
we
might
get
all
of
our
money
sooner
or
later.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it
were
what
would
you
say?
