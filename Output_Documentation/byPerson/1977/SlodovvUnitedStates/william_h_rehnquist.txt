such
person
is
the
word
the
statute
uses.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
then
you
rely
on
the
word
such
tax.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
was
the
revenue
service
as
you
describe
it
in
its
flexible
position
wasn't
it
mr.
burnett
that
if
they
did
bail
this
thing
out
which
was
a
real
looser
at
the
time
the
petitioner
took
over,
the
government
would
eventually
get
all
of
its
tax
money,
so
it
has
the
same
incentive
as
lots
of
creditors
do
to
have
let
him
try
to
hang
in
there
and
pull
the
thing
out.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
under
your
theory
it
didn't
take
an
agreement,
he
was
under
an
immediate
duty
that
liquidate
under
the
statute.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
if
it's
a
personal
liability
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
if
you
are
right
as
to
your
generic
interpretation
of
any
tax
imposed
by
this
title
and
the
first
clause
of
section
6672
that
still
doesn't
answer
your
opponent's
contention
that
the
phrasing
is
in
the
conjunctive,
that
before
that
liability
was
imposed
on
him,
he
has
to
be
are
required
to
collect,
truthfully
account
for,
and
pay
over.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course
in
your
view
the
government
really
isn't
taking
a
risk,
because
if
the
corporation
succeeds,
it
gets
it
from
the
corporation
and
if
the
corporation
fails
it
gets
it
from
the
person
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the
person
in
charge
doesn't
have
it
then
it's
only
to
that
extent
