justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
have
for
an
announcement
number
76-1835,
slodov
versus
united
states
which
is
here
from
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
sixth
circuit.
this
is
another
tax
case.
a
food
vending
business
withheld
from
it’s
employees'
wages
some
$250,000
of
income
and
social
security
taxes.
the
withheld
moneys
were
not
however
paid
over
to
the
internal
revenue
service
at
the
time
required
by
law.
the
petitioner
bought
the
business.
the
sellers
told
him
that
the
$250,000
that
had
been
withheld
was
on
deposit
in
bank
accounts,
maintained
by
the
business
and
the
petitioner
promptly
drew
checks
on
the
accounts
in
favor
of
the
internal
revenue
service
to
pay
over
the
withheld
taxes.
however,
the
sellers
had
lied
to
the
petitioner.
there
wasn’t
had
cent
in
any
one
of
the
business
bank
accounts.
the
sellers
had
in
fact
dissipated
the
entire
$250,000
of
withheld
taxes
and
petitioner
there
upon
requested
the
internal
revenue
service
for
some
guidance
as
to
what
to
do
and
there
was
evidence
that
the
irs
officials
advised
him
that
they
had
no
objection
to
his
continuing
the
business,
so
long
as
current
taxes
were
paid
and
petitioner
there
upon
carried
on
for
some
months
and
gross
receipts
of
the
business
averaged
a
$130,000
a
week.
petitioner
properly
turned
over
withheld
taxes
from
these
current
operations,
the
yields,
the
rest
of
them
$130,000
a
weekly
proceeds
to
pay
current
bills
for
supplies,
wages,
inventory
and
wasn’t
able
to
and
didn't
pay
anything
on
the
account
of
the
$250,000
arrears.
the
business
finally
failed
leaving
that
full
amount
still
owed.
there
upon
the
petitioner
who
by
the
way
is
an
orthodontist
by
trade
and
by
profession
rather
than
not
a
businessmen,
instituted
the
proceeding
for
a
personal
arrangement
under
chapter
12
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
the
irs
filed
a
claim
against
petitioner
personally
in
that
proceeding
under
section
6672
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
now
section
6672
imposes
personal
liability
for
withheld
taxes
due
from
an
employer,
that
personal
liability
and
i
am
quoting
the
statute
“imposed
on
any
person
required
to
collect
on
behalf
of
the
employer
truthfully
account
for
and
pay
over
any
tax
imposed
by
the
code,
that's
the
way
statute
leads.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
held
that
petitioner
was
personally
liable
under
that
section
to
pay
that
$250,000,
rejecting
petitioner’s
contention
that
because
he
wasn’t
the
person
responsible
for
collection
of
the
taxes
withheld
had
nothing
whatever
they
do
with
the
business
when
they
were
collected
before
he
bought
it,
section
6672
imposed
no
duty
upon
him
to
pay
the
taxes
withheld
and
dissipated
by
his
predecessors.
well
we
disagree
and
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals.
we
reject
the
government's
argument
that
section
6672
impressed
a
trust
on
the
$130,000
weekly
realized
by
petitioner
while
they
carried
on
the
business.
we
hold
that
section
6672
could
make
petitioner
liable
and
respective
moneys
withheld
before
he
acquired
the
business
only
to
the
extent
that
such
funds
were
still
on
hand
at
the
time
he
bought
the
business
and
then
as
i
said,
there
wasn’t
sent
on
him
because
the
sellers
to
him,
the
orthodontist
had
dissipated
all
of
them.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
joining
the
court’s
opinion
has
also
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
mr.
justice
