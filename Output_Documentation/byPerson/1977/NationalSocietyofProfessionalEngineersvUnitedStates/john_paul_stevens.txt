mr.
loevinger,
could
i
just
ask
you
a
kind
of
a
broad
question?
what
is
the
scope
of
the,
just
in
what
area
should
anti-competitive
agreements
be
permitted?
is
it
because
you
deal
with
very
dangerous
products
or
because
it
is
a
professional
society?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
if
that
is
true,
the
potential
for
buildings
falling
down,
effect
professionals
really
all
irrelevant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
relevance
then
if
it
is
not
anti-competitive
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
you
know,
through
years
and
years
it
has
been
argued
that
the
price
cutter
is
unethical,
on
occasion
it
cheats
the
consumer
and
he
does
and
do
frauds,
people
know
that,
but
why
is
this
industry
different
from
other
industries?
what
is
that
that
it
is--
?
justice
john
paul
stevens
these
are
unsophisticated
buyers
we
are
dealing
with?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
supposing
you
are
selling
computers
and
the
customer
do
not
understand
very
much
about
it.
would
that
justify
anti-competitive
arrangements
among
computer
manufacturers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
i
am
asking,
trying
to
understand,
what
is
the
scope
of
the
area
in
which
you
say
the
per
se
rules
do
not
apply
or
anti-competitive
arrangements
maybe
made.
is
it
the
difficulty
of
understanding
the
business
on
the
part
of
the
buyer,
is
the
fact
that
it
is
professional
or
is
the
fact
it
is
dangerous?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
rule
would
then
apply
to
the
medical
profession
and
the
legal
profession
quite
clearly.
does
that
characteristic
applies
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
surely
the
client
that
goes
to
the
lawyer
does
not
understand
the
answer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
rule
that
you
are
seeking
to
the
court
to
adopt
apply
to
the
medical,
to
the
legal
profession
as
well
as
engineering
profession?
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
until
after
he
is
been
selected
to
do
the
work.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean
it
does
not
involve
initial
selection
and
all
is
left
after
that
is
negotiate
the
price
of
the
services.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
can
not
find
out
how
much
it
is
going
to
cost
him
till
he
has
a
engineer
has
a
general
notion
of
the
scope
of
the
work.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
national
society
of
professional
engineers
against
united
states,
the
united
states
brought
this
civil
antitrust
suit
against
the
society,
alleging
that
it's
canon
of
ethics
which
prohibits
members
from
submitting
competitive
bids
for
engineering
services,
suppressed
competition
in
violation
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
the
society
defended
on
the
ground
that
the
canon
was
justified
under
the
rule
of
reasons
because
it
was
adapted
by
members
of
a
learned
profession
for
the
purpose
of
minimizing
the
risk,
that
competition
would
reduce
inferior
engineering
work,
endangering
the
public
safety.
without
making
any
findings
on
the
likelihood
that
competition
would
produce
the
dire
consequences
envisaged
by
petitioner,
the
district
court
rejected
this
justification.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
and
we
granted
certiorari.
on
its
face
the
canon
restrains
trade
within
the
meaning
of
the
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
under
the
rule
of
reason
the
proper
inquiry
is
whether
the
challenged
agreement
is
one
that
promotes
competition
or
one
that
suppresses
competition.
the
rule
does
not
supported
a
defense
based
on
an
argument
that
competition
itself
is
unreasonable.
accordingly
for
reasons
stated
in
full
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
blackmun
filed
an
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
rehnquist
joined,
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
the
chief
justice
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
descending
in
part.
mr.
justice
brennan
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
