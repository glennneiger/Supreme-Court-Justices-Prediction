unknown
speaker
no
charges
routinely
made
for
this
preliminary
negotiations
mr.
loevinger?
unknown
speaker
are
charges
routinely
made?
unknown
speaker
mr.
loevinger,
does
your
principle
forbid
two
engineers
from
engaging
in
the
same
conversations
about
the
same
project
with
the
same
client?
unknown
speaker
so
it
is
really
just
bidding,
it
does
not
forbid
competition?
unknown
speaker
if
it
is
not
really,
it
is
not
unethical
in
this
business
for
a
engineer
to
talk
with
a
client
when
he
knows
that
the
client
has
had
the
precisely
the
same
preliminary
conversation
with
another
engineer?
unknown
speaker
so
that
the
principle
is
not
to
prevent
competition
among
engineers?
unknown
speaker
what
if
one
engineers
had
this
preliminary
conversation
with
the
client
and
he
will
give
the
client
some
figures,
would
not
he?
unknown
speaker
and
then
the
client
goes
to
another
one
and
has
a
conversation
and
the
second
one
says,
have
you
talked
to
another
engineer?
yes
i
have.
did
he
give
you
some
figures?
yes
he
gave
me
some
figures.
and
so
he
gives
the
second
engineer
the
figures
and
the
second
engineer
cuts
them.
he
gives
him
a
lower
bid
if
you
want
to
call
it
that.
is
that
forbidden
by
your
ethical
principle?
unknown
speaker
no
he
has
the
conservation,
he
goes
through
the
whole
conversation.
unknown
speaker
is
there
no
some
restriction
on
when
the
information
maybe
given
by
the
engineering
firm
to
the
client?
unknown
speaker
but
a
client
can
find
out
how
much
it
is
going
to
cost
and
still
walk
away
from
the
engineer.
unknown
speaker
or
he
just
suggested
that
--
as
i
understand
that
a
client
may
have
a
conversation
with
one
engineer
and
get
a
price
for
him,
and
then
have
a
conversation
with
another
engineer
and
get
a
price
from
him.
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
what
is
--
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
is
his
contention.
that
is
and
you
think
that
the
findings
below
are
contrary
to
that?
unknown
speaker
are
there
findings
in
the
record
to
that
it
said
so?
unknown
speaker
because
that
is
just
saying
what
the
rule
means
one
engineer
will
compete
with
another.
unknown
speaker
well
how
can
the
rule
prevent
--
keep
a
client
from
disclosing
price
he
got
from
one
engineer
to
another?
unknown
speaker
so,
the
second
engineer
under
this
rule
should
not
listen
to
any
price
information
received
form
the
former
one.
unknown
speaker
mr.
shapiro,
you
said
towards
the
outset
i
think
of
your
remarks
that
there
was
no
claim
here
that
the
findings
of
the
district
court
approved
by
the
court
of
appeals
were
erroneous.
i
call
your
attention
to
appendix
to
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
on
page
a
11,
which
no
more
than
incorporates
the
--
sets
out
reproduces
the
opinion
judge
leventhal
opinion
for
the
court
of
appeals
in
which
he
says
and
i
am
reading,
“we
approve
the
district
court
comments,
finding
that
the
rule
is
this
rule
of
the
society
is
classic
price
fixing
and
hence
illegal
per
se.”
i
understood
mr.
loevinger
strongly
to
context
that
this
is
whatever
else
it
is
not
classic
price
fixing
to
which
any
per
se
rule
is
ever
attached
--
unknown
speaker
and
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeal
explicitly
found
that
it
was?
unknown
speaker
no
no
this
characterization
of
it,
that
he
says
this
is
not
price
fixing
of
a
kind
that
any
per
se
rule
is
ever
attached
to,
in
any
decision
of
this
court.
unknown
speaker
did
you
not
understand
him
to
say
much
the
same
things
i
paraphrased?
unknown
speaker
and
in
his
brief
--
unknown
speaker
and
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
court
of
appeals
i
presume.
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
quite
different
from
price
fixing
which
is
that
agreed
upon,
uniform,
single
price.
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
price
fixing
means.
unknown
speaker
so
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
were
wrong
if
we
are
talking
about
price
fixing
and
that
rather
pristine
sense
of
its
--
unknown
speaker
i
have
just
read
you
what
the
court
of
appeal
says,
we
approve
of
the
district
court's
description
that
this
is
classical
price
fixing?
unknown
speaker
what
lists
down
on
the
tip
of
your
tongue,
what
other
case
is
here
that
it
say
its
competitors
agree
not
to
compete
that
is
per
se
and
illegal.
unknown
speaker
and
do
the
cases
say
that
it
is
per
se
because
it
is
other
side
of
coin
from
price
fixing?
unknown
speaker
how
could
they
affirm
an
agreement
not
to
compete
on
the
facts
given
in
this
record?
unknown
speaker
this
is
nothing
like
any
sort
of
a
territorial
allocation
or
any
of
those
agreements
not
to
compete.
is
not
there
good
deal
of
competition--
unknown
speaker
among
engineers
to
get
clients
business.
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
rule
was
no
engineer
gives
a
price
until
he
has
had
a
talk,
a
good
enough
talk.
and
at
the
end
of
it
he
can
give
a
price
and
but
that
is
perfectly
alright
for
a
second
engineer
to
talk
to
the
same
client,
know
what
the
price
offered
was
but
after
he
has
had
a
good
enough
talk,
he
can
give
a
price.
now
if
that
were
the
case
would
you
be
here
or
not?
unknown
speaker
and
it
is
not
enough
for
you
if
there
can
only
be
sequential
discussion
but
the
second
fellow
can
know
all
he
needs
to
know
about
what
the
first
fellow
offered,
that
is
still
is
not
enough
for
you?
unknown
speaker
but
the
client
can
always
go
back
to
the
first
engineer?
unknown
speaker
in
this
very
large
record
that
has
been
compiled
was
there
any
expert
testimony
making
comparisons,
analogies
with
the
legal
profession
and
the
medical
profession?
unknown
speaker
in
the
baileys
crossroad
incident
had
the
engineers
competed
for
the
engineering
job?
unknown
speaker
now
the
question
here
is
that
the
per
se
violation
not
admitting
of
the
possibility
of
any
justification
in
terms
of
the
rule
of
reason--
unknown
speaker
yes
of
course
that
has
to
be,
that
it
is
--
unknown
speaker
mr.
shapiro,
what
do
you
think
congress
had
in
mind
in
brooke's
act?
unknown
speaker
now,
as
expressed
in
the
legislative
history
in
a
discussion
with
this
particular
ethical
rule?
unknown
speaker
doesn't
your
case
depend
on
your
making
stick
the
per
se
approach?
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
think
the
brooke's
act
bears
at
all
on
whether
or
not
the
per
se
rule
should
be
applied
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
you
have
congress
saying,
well,
we
prefer
to
get
engineering
services
by
this
particular
method,
and
yet
but
just
remember
that
we
have
another
statute
that
says
that
no
one
else
may
do
it.
no
one
else
will
have
this
privilege.
unknown
speaker
but
if
it
is
such
an
unreasonable
method
that
it
should
be
per
se
illegal?
unknown
speaker
well,
your
answer
is
yes.
but
do
you
say
that
these
two
statutes
side
by
side
--
you
can
ride
both
horses?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
not
what
the
rule
of
reason
means
as
a
term
of
antitrust
law
at
all,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
but
it
does
not
mean
you
could
justify
for
safety
reasons
either,
justifies
for
competitive
reasons.
as
the
rule
comes
to
promote
competition.
unknown
speaker
you
are
speaking
that
the
judgment
as
modified
by
the
court?
unknown
speaker
and
the
modification
you
do
not
quarrel.
unknown
speaker
mr.
shapiro,
one
last
question
from
me,
what
is
the
significance,
what
is
the
government's
view
of
the
significance
of
the
fact,
as
i
understand
it
that
before
serious
negotiations
began
and
when
it
is
appropriate
to
talk
price,
there
is
a
lot
of
work
done
by
the
engineering
firm
and
there
is
no
charge
during
that
period?
if
that
is
the
correct
description
of
what
happens
in
that?
unknown
speaker
i
had
the
impression
the
general
practice
was,
it
takes
quite
a
bit
of
work
to
find
out
what
a
job
is,
the
scope
of
the
job
and
during
that
period
the
preliminary
work
is
really
not,
not
paid
for.
unknown
speaker
do
you
understand
the
rule
that
permit
the
firm
to
quote
in
advance
a
fee
on
doing
a
pre-feasibility
study?
unknown
speaker
until
after
the
pre-feasibility
study
is
done.
unknown
speaker
that
maybe
but
there
is
a
rule
forbidden.
unknown
speaker
mr.
shapiro
says
there
is.
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
basis
for
his
saying
then
that
i
guess
i
should
have
asked
him
saying
that
the
rule
forbid
an
engineer
to
talk
to
a
client,
if
he
is
already
talking
to
an
engineer
until
his
relationship
with
the
first
engineer
has
terminated
now
what
is
basis
for
that?
unknown
speaker
also
he
is
right
on
that,
you
just
would
not
find
under
this
rule
one
engineer
dealing
with
the
same
client
that
already
has
an
engineer.
unknown
speaker
the
simultaneous
conversations
are
not
permitted
under
the
rule.
unknown
speaker
other
strict
factual
question
like
that
i
am
surprised
that
counsel
are
not
able
to
came
to
a
closure
agreement.
unknown
speaker
it
is
certainly
not
irrelevant,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
rule
forbids
one
engineer
to
see
another?
unknown
speaker
mr.
loevinger,
what
does
this
mean
when
the
rule
says,
an
engineer,
according
to
page
40
of
the
government's
brief,
requested
to
submit
a
fee
proposal
or
a
bid
prior
to
the
selection
of
an
engineering
firm
subject
to
the
negotiation
of
satisfactory
contract
shall
attempt
have
the
procedure
change
to
conform
to
ethical
practices
but
if
not
successful
he
shall
withdraw
from
consideration
for
the
proposed
work,
what
does
that
mean?
unknown
speaker
and
let
us
suppose
i
am
client
and
i
go
to
an
engineer
and
have
a
much
talk
as
mr.
loevinger
thinks
i
ought
to
have.
and
i
talk
to
him
and
i
want
a
proposal
from
him,
and
the
engineer
gives
it
to
me
and
then
i
would
say
that
the
–
by
the
way
i
am
going
to
take
this
proposal
and
submit
it
to
another
engineer
and
i
am
going
to
certainly
talk
to
him
all
he
wants
to
talk
about,
now
what
would
be
wrong
with
that,
why
would
that
be
unethical?
unknown
speaker
well
i
thought
you
said
the
second
engineer
should
not
talk
to
the
first
to
the
client
until
he
is
terminated
his
relationships
with
the
first.
unknown
speaker
he
says
to
the
first
one
he
says
i
am
going
to
come
back
to
you
if
i
cannot
get
better
deal
out
of
the
next
fellow.
unknown
speaker
mr.
loevinger
you
are
just
using
lawyer's
language.
when
does
this
rule
require
the
engineer
to
withdraw
from
consideration
of
the
proposed
work,
it
describes
some
situation
in
which
the
engineer
has
a
duty
under
the
rule
to
withdraw.
what
is
that,
when
does
that
happen?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
well
mr.
loevinger
would
you
not
have
said
that
the
rule
at
least
forbids
this.
the
client
calls
up
the
engineer
and
he
says
come
over,
i
want
i
talk
to
you
about
the
building,
when
the
engineer
arrives
there,
he
finds
another
engineer
there,
the
client
says
to
both
of
them,
we
are
going
to
talk
as
long
and
as
hard
necessary
so
you
both
understand
the
scope
of
the
work
and
everything
else
and
then
i
want
you,
i
want
you
both
to
listen,
ask
as
many
questions
you
want
to,
then
i
want
you
both
to
go
off
and
give
me
a
proposal.
now
i
take
it,
the
rule
forbids
that.
unknown
speaker
and
now
why
would
it
forbid
that?
that
certainly
is
not
the
impractical.
unknown
speaker
so
that
is
an
example
when
both
engineers
should
withdraw.
