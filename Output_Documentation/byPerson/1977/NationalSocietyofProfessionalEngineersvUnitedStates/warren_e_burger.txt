chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
arguments
next
in
national
society
of
engineers
against
the
united
states.
mr.
loevinger
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
anything
from
preventing
him
from
asking
two
engineers
to
embark
on
this
process
at
the
same
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
he
does
not
like
the
first
engineers
estimates,
he
certainly--
you
have
already
said
then
he
can
try
again
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
their
any
way
to
--
i
thought
you
said
there
is
really
no
way
to
test
a
structure
in
the
sense
that
you
do
prototype
of
an
airplane
or
an
automobile
or
wash
machine.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
the
substitute
for
that
testing
or
at
least
the
partial
substitute
is
the
building
inspection
which
goes
on
from
day
to
day
or
even
hour
to
hour
as
a
building
is
going
up
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
goldfarb
on
other
hand
had
a
record
which
shows
that
no
lawyer
consulted,
there
were
great
many
of
them
would
do
the
work
for
less
than
the
price
specified
in
the
fee
schedule.
so
that
was
price
fixing
cleared,
so
that
was
held.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
bid
might
be
higher
or
lower?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
bid
is
the
right
word,
the
response
might
be
higher.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
if
it
is
a
big
bridge
for
example
he
might
â€“
engineer
might
have
to
invest
i
suppose
a
great
deal
of
time
which
he
is
then
at
risk
of
losing
without
compensation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
shapiro.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
you
were
going
to
give
us
appendix
reference.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
spoke
of
a
prohibition
against
talking
to
a
second
engineer
until
the
savoring
of
the
relationship
of
the
first.
is
there
any
relationship
in
the
ordinary
legal
sense
with
the
first?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you
are
having
conversations.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
different
from
let
us
say
the
medical
profession?
unless
there
is
open
consultation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
if
you
do
not
disclose
it
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
can
an
intelligent
bid
be
made
without
on
a
large
project,
without
a
very
great
deal
of
exploration
and
study
and
discussion.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
do
not
have
specification
handed
to
them
as
contractor
does
do
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
wait
a
minute,
you
said
they
cannot
ask
the
engineer.
these
rules
cannot
control
the
clients.
the
engineer
may
be
prohibited
from
quoting
an
hourly
rate.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
goldfarb
price
fixing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
where
would
we
find
in
this
record
evidence
or
a
finding
that
they
agreed
in
advance,
the
engineers
agreed
it
among
themselves
in
advance
to
on
certain
prices
such
as
was
found
in
goldfarb?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
is
there
an
appropriate
foundation
laid
for
his
opinion
and
did
he
testify
that
he
had
examined
the
baileys
crossroad?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
that
take
in
to
account
whether
the
construction
engineer
would
may
have
a
bid,
had
ever
engaged
in
that
kind
of
work
before?
suppose
if
the
(inaudible)
replaced
the
brooklyn
bridge?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
sounds
something
closely
approaching
a
rule
of
reason.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
loevinger.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let
me
see
if
i
can
get
that
concretely.
suppose
that
a
building
is
pointed
to
by
the
perspective
client
and
they
say
that
the
engineer,
we
want
a
building
just
like
that
one,
what
will
it
cost
would,
would
you
give
us
a
figure
right
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
i
am
speaking
now
of
building
that
he
did
not
engineer
himself,
someone
else
did.
anything
to
prevent
him
from
going
to
the
other
engineer
and
getting
the
plans?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgments
and
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases,
national
society
of
professional
engineers
against
the
united
states,
and
city
of
los
angeles
against
manhart
will
each
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
stevens.
