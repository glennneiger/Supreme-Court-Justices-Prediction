when
the
word

really
--
i
talk
to

say,
one
guy
will
give
it
to
you
$4400,
you
say
well
i
will
come
in
a
few
hours
and
if
it
is
still
there,
i
will
buy
and
meanwhile
you
go
and
talk
to
three
of
four
others.

terminated
is
not

of
art.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
suppose
the
man,
the
first
man
says
number
one,
i
want
this
to
strictly
understand,
or
understood
i
have
not
terminated
this,
i
am
still
perceiving
with
it,
but
i
want
to
talk
to
somebody
else.
i
do
not
think
you
can
terminate
it,
he
has
to
terminate
it
then.
