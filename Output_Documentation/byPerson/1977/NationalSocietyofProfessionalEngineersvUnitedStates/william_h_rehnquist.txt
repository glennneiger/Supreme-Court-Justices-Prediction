there
is
a
good
deal
of
engineering
work
that
goes
into
the
sale
of
some
complex
electrical
equipment
that
is
manufactured
by
electric
or
equipment
manufacturers
too
is
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
then
that
this
principle
what
you
are
enunciating
what
your
clients
have
enunciated
is
an
exception
for
the
engineers
from
the
per
se
rule
only
in
the
case
of
structures
on
real
property.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
let
me
--
perhaps
i
can
ask
you
you
a
question
that
will
solve
my
problem
more
quickly.
your
distinction
for
antitrust
purposes
between
manufacturers
of
electrical
equipment
who
use
--
which
may
be
a
one
item
deal
and
may
take
a
great
deal
of
engineering
design
skill
and
your
client's
code
of
ethics
is
that
your
client's
code
of
ethics
applies
only
to
structures
on
real
property
which
are
not
pretested
for
safety.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
as
part
of
your
argument,
is
it
not
mr.
loevinger
that
unlike
the
virginia
state
bar
case,
this
is
not
price
fixing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
while
even
assuming
that
it
is
a
concerted
action
which
affects
price
nonetheless
your
claim
is
even
even
accepting
that
much,
which
i
know
you
do
not
that
in
any
event
it
is
not
price
fixing
and
therefore
it
is
not
amenable
to
any
per
se
rule
that
this
court
has
ever
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
we
know
a
learned
profession
received
