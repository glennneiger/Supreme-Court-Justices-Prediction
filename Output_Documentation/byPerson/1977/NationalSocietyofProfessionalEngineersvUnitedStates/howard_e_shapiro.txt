mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it
would
be
useful
i
think
for
us
to
look
at
the
text
of
the
ethical
rule
which
is
the
subject
of
this
litigation.
it
is
printed
in
the
government's
brief
at
page
4
as
well
as
in
the
various
opinions
of
the
district
court,
court
of
appeals
and
in
findings.
it
defines
competitive
bidding
as
the
formal
or
informal
submission
or
receipt,
a
verbal
or
written
estimates
of
cost
or
proposals
in
terms
of
dollars
man
days
of
work
required,
percentage
of
construction
cost
or
any
other
measure
of
compensation
whereby
the
prospective
client
may
compare
engineering
services
on
a
price
basis.
prior
to
the
time
that
one
engineer
or
engineering
organization
has
been
selected
for
negotiations.
the
disclosure
of
recommended
fees
schedules
prepared
by
various
engineering
societies
is
not
considered
to
be
competitive
bidding.
now
the
purpose
and
affect
of
the
rule
were
found
by
the
two
courts
below
to
be
the
total
suppression
of
price
competition.
court
of
appeals
described
it
as
a
price
maintenance
mechanism.
petitioner
does
not
challenge
any
of
the
findings
of
the
district
court
as
clearly
erroneous,
and
they
were
found
not
to
be
clearly
erroneous.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
i
must
respectfully
disagree
with
my
colleague
on
that.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
his
contention.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
my
understanding
certainly
professional
policy
10-f
which
is
their
interpretation
of
the
rule
that
is
incorporated
into
its
enforcement
and
application
does
provide
that
although
a
client
may
talk
to
other
engineers
sequentially,
he
can
not
do
it
simultaneously.
he
is
required
to
completely
severe
the
relations
before
approaching
another
firm
or
putting
it
in
another
way,
other
engineers
will
not
talk
to
the
clients
while
he
is
talking
to
another
engineer.
it
is
considered
unethical.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
district
court
did
not
make
a
specific
finding
to
that
affect,
i
would
refer
the
court
to
joint
appendix
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
what
the
rule
means
according
to
what
the
courts
below
found
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes
your
honor.
this
is
in
our
brief
at
page
42
we
cite
joint
appendix
5767,
it
is
5767
and
9930,
that
is
professional
policy
10-f.
the
professional
policy
are
interpretations
of
the
rule
of
ethics
by
nspe's
board
of
directors
of
board
of
ethical
review.
i
have
forgotten
which--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
only
in
the
sense
of
a
--
not
in
a
legal
sense
your
honor
only
that
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
you
are
having
conversations
but
the
second
engineer
will
not
talk
to
you
while
you
are
talking
to
first
engineer.
this
has
a
very
practical
effect.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
i
imagine
you
can
talk
to
one
doctor
at
a
time
without--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
there
is
noting
in
the
record
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
your
question
your
honor.
but
i
would
like
to
return
to
the
record
here
because
this
is
a
worthwhile
claim.
the
rule
on
its
face
does
not
permit
the
disclosure
of
any
price
comparison
information
so
that
since
you
have
no
price
comparison
information
you
simply
can
not
have
any
kind
of
price
competition,
there
is
no
competition.
it
is
something
of
a
paradox
i
think
for
the
petitioner
to
argue.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
it
cannot
keep
the
client
from
doing
it
but
it
can
encourage
the
engineers
not
to
talk
to
the
client
and
that
is
what
happens
because
this
rule
is
enforced
in
effect
by
boycott--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
should
not
even
talk
to
the
client
until
he
knows
that
the
first
engineer
has
totally
withdrawn,
that
there
has
been
a
negotiation,
that
they
have
failed
to
reach
agreement
on
a
price,
then
he
can
come
in
and
talk.
and
what
we
have
therefore
is
not
any
kind
of
price
comparison
or
price
competition,
you
have
nothing
but
bargaining
that
all
is
allowed.
now
this
has
significant
practical
effects.
it
means
that
the
client
seeking
to
go
from
one
engineer
to
another
has
very
significant
search
costs.
it
is
an
expensive
process
it
take
time
it
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
certainly
your
honor--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no.
and
that
is
why
no
one
suggests
that
there
has
to
be
rigid
absolute
advertised
price
bidding.
the
sherman
act
does
not
require
that.
what
the
sherman
act
condemns
in
this
case
is
the
collective
imposition
on
clients
and
on
engineer
of
a
bar
that
lets
them
consider
any
aspect
of
price.
they
cannot
even
ask
the
engineer
what
is
your
hourly
rate
to
give
themselves
some
idea
before
they
begin
going
further.
these
are
matters.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
right.
i
mean
as
a
practical
matter
they
cannot
ask
because
the
not
only
will
the
engineer
not
quote
it
but
if
the
client
persists
in
asking
any
engineer,
the
rule
says
and
the
record
shows
that
the
engineer
approached
must
withdraw.
in
short,
what
we
have
here
and
this
how
the
rule
is
actually
enforced,
is
not
only
a
rule
against
price
comparison
information,
but
a
rule
that
restricts
the
disclosure
of
price
information
except
where
minimum
fixed
fee
schedules
are
involved.
and
in
addition
is
enforced
by
boycott.
and
we
have
incidents
where
that
kind
of
a
threat
has
been
made.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well
your
honor--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes
they
did
your
honor
and
mr.
loevinger
contests
the
ultimate--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well
i
think--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
he
said
he
means
that
contention
in
this
court
and
his
ultimate
point--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
and
in
his
brief
but
as
far
as
the
findings--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
but
as
far
as
the
findings
of
facts
in
the
district
court,
the
specific
findings
he
does
not
suggest
that
this
rule
has
any
other
affect
than
what
has
been
described
forth.
it
cannot
be,
he
does
not
argue
that
there
is
any
disclosure
of
price
information.
he
does
not
argue
that
there
is
any
price
competition
under
the
law--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes.
in
that
sense
that
the
engineers
have
agreed
among
themselves
to
maintain
a
certain
price,
the
answer
is
no
they
have
not
agreed
to
maintain
a
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
but
the
court
of
appeals
was
more
careful
in
its
opinion.
it
recognized
that--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
because
of
its
overall
affect,
because
there
has
been
a
total
suppression
of
price
competition.
there
cannot
be
any
in
this--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well
we
would
start
with
socony-vacuum,
we
would
point
to
container
corporation,
we
would
point
to
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
in
affect
yes,
if
there
is
a
tampering
with
the
price
system
that
so
operates
that
price
competition
can
not
function
and
that
is
what
is
involved
here.
then
that
is
also
illegal
per
se,
that
is
what
socony
says,
that
is
what
container
describes
and
that
is
what
we
are
arguing
here.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
now
you
would
not
find
that,
we
do
not
charge
that.
what
we
charge
is
a
total
a
suppression
of
price
competition.
what
the
district
court
found
was
a
total
suppression
of
price
competition.
what
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
was
a
finding
that
there
was
a
total
suppression
of
price
competition
and
they
found
it
so
closely
related
to
price
fixing
that
they
considered
it
to
be
the
same
thing.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
language
of
the
rule
so
provides
if
you
totally
suppress
all
price
comparison
information,
you
are
agreeing
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
not
price
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes
there
is,
but
not
price
competition
your
honor
and
that
is
what
we
are
talking
about.
total
suppression
of
price
competition
or
the
possibility
of
price
competition.
now,
i
just
suggested
a
moment
ago
that
no
one
is
arguing
that
clients
or
engineers
have
to
resort
to
some
sort
of
rigid
competitive
bidding,
they
can
decide
for
themselves
the
extent
to
which
they
will
consider
problems.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well
if
we
permitted
sequential,
simultaneous
discussion
that
would
be
a
different
case.
but
simultaneous
discussion
is
not
allowed
only
sequential
discussion
is
allowed
under
this
rule
and
this
effect--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
if
there
can
only
be
sequential
discussion
then
the
client
suffers
a
very
severe
and
burdensome
additional
cost--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
or
go
back
to
the
first,
the
point
is
that
there
is
a,
there
is
not
an
opportunity
for
price
comparison
in
the
way
that
price
comparison
is
available
every
where
else
in
our
economy.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no
your
honor,
there
was
expert
testimony
of
this
kind.
there
were
officials
and
members
passed,
officials
past
and
present
of
an
nspe,
who
as
engineers
testify
that
in
their
opinion,
price
competition
or
price
comparison
would
be
very
harmful
and
undesirable.
when
they
were
asked
on
cross-
examination,
do
you
have
any
specific
instances
in
which
it
is
ever
been
shown
that
safety
is
impaired
by
the
existence
of
some
consideration
of
price,
they
would
invariably
answer,
i
have
no
specific
instances.
reference
was
made
to
the
testimony
of
an
insurance
executive
mr.
duvall(ph),
mr.
duvall's
certainly
established
that
engineering
is
related
to
safety
but
his
testimony
does
not
establish
that
price
bidding
or
price
competition
is
automatically
tied
to
unsafe
practices.
for
example,
he
mentioned
the
baileys
crossroads
incident
which
was
in
mr.
duvall's
testimony.
mr.
duvall
said
that
building
fell
because
cement
supports
were
withdrawn
too
soon.
that
is
a
construction
man's
error
and
the
testimony
went
on
to
say
of
course
the
case
is
in
litigation
and
i
cannot
say
anymore.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no
he
did
not
your
honor.
he
gave
us
about
17,
he
was
testifying
from
his
experience
as
an
insurance
executive.
in
the
business
of
insuring
engineers
and
construction
people.
he
gave
many
examples
but
if
each
one
is
examined
in
detail,
one
finds
what
he
described
was
the
fact
that
accidents
can
occur
when
there
is
bad
engineering
or
dishonest
engineering.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
record
does
not
show
as
far
as
i
know.
well,
proceeding
on
with
the
affects
of
this
rule
what
we
see
is
that
it
is
based
on
two
premises.
one
that
engineering
clients
should
always
be
kept
in
ignorance
of
the
price
comparison
information
for
their
own
good.
they
cannot
be
allowed
to
anything
about
price
comparison
information
and
engineers
cannot
be
trusted
to
do
their
job
safely,
if
clients
can
make
price
comparisons.
so
it
denies
relevant
information
to
the
client,
it
prevents
the
engineers
from
offering
services
on
their
own
terms.
it
allows
only
price
bargaining
not
price
competition,
because
it
totally
suppresses
price
competition.
the
rule
is
certainly
not
pro-competitive
unless
you
want
to
save
at
the
total
suppression
of
competition
is
pro-competitive.
now
these
were
the
findings--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
and
our
argument
is--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes
your
honor
and
that
it
really
is
a
classic
case
of
price
fixing
because
it
serves
as
a
price
maintenance
device.
the
economic
testimony
in
this
case
by
professor
arnold
at
the
university
of
illinois
was
a
government
witness
test
was
to
the
effect
that
with
this
kind
of
a
rule
engineers
do
not
have
any
incentive
to
cut
their
prices
because
they
are
not
competing
with
each
other.
they
have
an
incentive
to
cut
the
costs
but
not
the
prices.
so
you
have
a
kind
of
price
maintenance
effect
and
that
is
what
judge
leventhal
summarized
these
findings
as
meaning.
now,
i
should
say
that
a
per
se
rule
here
does
not
bar
nspe
from
adopting
any
kind
of
specific
rules.
it
requires
aims
at
fraud,
at
deception,
at
over-reaching,
at
disregard
of
engineering
standards.
these
are
rules
aimed
at
specific
abuses
but
they
were
not
before
this
court.
they
were
not
before
the
district
court,
the
only
thing
before
the
court
is
this
total
abolition
of
price
competition.
it
is
suggested
that
the
case
should
nevertheless
be
reviewed
under
the
rule
of
reason
because
a
learned
profession
is
involved
or
because
price
competition
is
unfeasible
in
engineering
or
because
engineering
affects
public
safety.
well,
as
i
understand
it
nspe
now
concedes
that
except
for
real
estate
construction,
price
competition
is
feasible
in
engineering.
it
is
certainly
practical
for
routine
tests.
it
applies
in
the
most
difficult
area
of
all
research
and
development
contracts
where
it
is
most
difficult
to
predict
what
cost
will
be
and
the
engineers
themselves
have
had
fixed
fee
schedules
for
years
in
their
state
societies
which
this
rule
specifically
refers
to.
now
that
again
implies
that
there
are
certainly
tasks
where
price
information
can
be
disclosed.
the
second
possibility
for
the
rule
of
reason
argument
is
that
there
is
a
learned
profession
exemption.
certainly
in
goldfarb,
there
was
a
note
of
caution
in
footnote
17.
the
court
in
holding
that
goldfarb
involved
classic
price
fixing
and
learned
professions
were
not
exempt,
also
said
in
footnote
17,
there
might
be
situations
with
the
public
service
obligations
of
learned
professions
require
different
approach
under
the
antitrust
laws.
we
express
no
view
except
with
respect
to
the
matters
before
us.
i
think
the
short
answer
is
that
yes
in
the
learned
professions
there
may
be
different
public
service
requirements
that
justify
a
rule
of
reason
approach
where
would
not
apply
in
other
professions
or
other
activities.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
one
of
the
problems
that
the
term
is
not
defined
and
would
have
to
be
explored.
i
do
not
contest
the
learned
profession
nature
of
the
engineering
profession.
we
did
not
contest
it
below.
but
i
do
suggest
that
whatever
the
scope
of
the
learned
profession
caution
like
in
footnote
17maybe
in
goldfarb,
it
does
not
authorize
the
total
suppression
of
all
price
competition
because
price
is
the
central
nervous
system
of
our
economy.
finally
there
is
another
aspect
to
this
learned
profession
problem.
up
to
now
in
the
antitrust
laws
we
have
not
considered
rule
of
reason
or
per
se
except
in
terms
of
the
market
place,
in
terms
of
competitive
effects.
a
per
se
rule
is
a
rule
which
on
balance
between
pro-competitive
effects
and
anti-competitive
effects
almost
always
has
anticompetitive
effects
and
therefore
we
do
not
make
any
further
inquiry.
a
rule
of
reason
approach
says
let
us
see
what
the
other
competitive
effects
are,
but
there
has
been
a
caution
in
the
loss
and
strengthen
potteries,
not
to
step
beyond
competition
which
is
what
the
sherman
act
is
concerned
about,
for
the
courts
not
to
step
beyond
competition
and
to
go
in
for
the
questions
of
social
policy
that
involved
other
justifications.
now
in
this
record
we
have
a
rather
strongly
contested
contention
that
public
safety
requires
the
abolition
of
price
competition
and
engineering.
there
is
a
contrary
view,
we
presented
an
expert
witness
from
secretary
of
airforce
who
said
there
is
no
objective
evidence
to
support
this
kind
of
view
that
price
competition
results
in
unsafe
practices.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
brooke's
act
is
a
good
example
of
what
we
are
contending
for
namely
that
the
client
should
decide
for
himself
whether
and
to
what
extent
he
wants
to
consider
price.
the
brooke's
act
certainly
was
an
exception
of
the
antitrust
laws,
it
represented
a
judgment
by
congress,
in
a
particular
area
of
government
procurement
that
engineering
services
would
be
acquired
by
the
so
called
traditional
method.
many
states
also
have
such
provisions
and
we
do
not
deny
that.
that
is
a
case
where
congress
did
the
balancing
and
congress
made
the
determination.
it
incidentally
did
not
appear
to
be
motivated
primarily
by
safety,
it
was
concerned
more
with
the
traditions
of
the
profession
there
and
it
expressly
said
in
a
report
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
i
do
not
recall
specifically
that
it
did?
it
did
include
a
discussion
of
the
then
pending
report
of
the
government
--
of
the
commission
on
procurement,
and
noted
that
the
matter
was
still
under
discussion.
that
report
which
is
on
the
record
concluded
here
that
its
gx
346
--
concluded
that
there
is
no
objective
evidence
that
there
is
a
threat
to
safety,
because
of
price
competition.
the
problem
with
relying
on
public
safety
arguments
in
the
context
of
an
antitrust
case
in
which
court
would
balance
public
safety
against
competition
or
some
other
non-competition
factor
against
the
suppression
of
price
competition
,
is
that
it
is
a
slippery
slope,
that
is
the
term
that
was
used
in
their
reply
brief.
the
same
argument
could
justify
privately
imposed
restraints
in
most
industries.
you
could
take
the
construction
industry,
the
same
argument
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
the
case
which
we
have
made
your
honor.
we
stand
with
that.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no,
we
do
not
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
congress
will
in
effect
balance
the
considerations
itself
and--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
what
is
unreasonable
is
the
concerted
imposition.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
we
can
your
honor.
and
i
will
explain
it
in
this
way.
what
the
sherman
act
is
aimed
at
is
the
concerted
imposition
of
the
suppression
of
price
competition
by
private
action.
what
the
brooke's
act
reflects
is
a
decision
by
congress
or
an
appropriate
government
agency
to
forgo
price
competition.
if
this
case
stands
it
does
not
mean
that
there
is
going
to
be
price
competition
across
the
board.
some
engineering
clients
are
going
to
say
let
us
just
pick
the
engineer
we
consider
the
best
and
talk
with
him.
if
we
cannot
reach
a
price
we
will
go
through
a
sequential
negotiation.
some
people
will
attempt
what
was
attempted
by
the
department
of
defense
until
it
was
frustrated
by
a
boycott
by
the
national
society
of
professional
engineers.
as
the
district
court
expressly
found.
that
was
an
experiment
under
which
there
were
two
proposals.
let
us
have
your
technical
proposal
which
the
engineers
were
willing
to
submit,
and
will
rank
you
on
your
technical
proposals,
engineers
and
then
submit
to
us
your
price
proposals.
and
then
we
will
see
whether
it
will
change
our
mind
about
our
rankings
of
the
technical
proposals.
that
project
failed
in
the
summer
of
1970.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
it
would
certainly
take
in
to
account
things
like
reputation
and
ability.
clients
are
free
to
do
this
under
the
position
we
take,
they
may
not
want
to
use
any
kind
of
price
competition,
they
may
not
want
to
know
anything
about
price.
it
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
project
and
the
circumstances.
some
projects
are
so
repetitive
that
they
can
almost
be
handled
like
standard
construction
bidding
contracts.
others
would
be
so
unique.
for
instance,
a
research
and
development
contract
to
which
price
competition
applies
incidentally
but
you
might
not
really
want
to
let
in
the
ordinary
sense.
the
extent
to
which
price
goes
in
to
the
equation
is
something
for
the
client
and
the
engineer
to
decide
for
themselves.
that
is
all
we
are
arguing
for.
not
to
have
it
determined
by
a
private
organization.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
we
think
that
it
follows
almost
automatically
from
applying
a
per
se
approach.
i
mean
as
far
as
the
consequence,
as
far
as
the
client
is
concerned
the
--
applying
the
antitrust
laws
in
this
way
lets
the
reason
of
choice.
the
rule
of
reason
--
let
me
put
it
that
way
be
applied
by
the
individual
client
or
the
individual
engineer.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no,
in
antitrust
law
the
rule
really
means
that
balancing
pro-competitive
and
anticompetitive
effects
not
all
kinds
of
social
considerations.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
exactly
the
point
and
that
if
there
is
to
be
a
justification
for
safety
reasons
that
the
congress
should
make
that
kind
of
decision.
now
one
very
brief
word
on
the
judgment
in
this
case.
it
has
been
attacked
it
is
being
over
broadened
violating
the
first
amendment.
we
think
that
if
it
is
examined
it
will
be
seen
that
if
the
finding
of
liability
stands
here
that
this
judgment
precisely
fits
the
violation
found
because
it
simply
calls
for
a
correction
of
the
practice
by
eliminating
the
ethical
restraint
from
any
provisions
of
nspe's
rules
by
barring
any
attempt
to
achieve
any
same
result
of
affiliated
state
societies
by
eliminating
the
fixed
fee
schedules
mentioning
any
of
the
rules
and
then
preventing
the
continuation
of
the
practice.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
as
modified
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
we
do
not
quarrel.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
it
is
not
absolute,
it
varies,
there
maybe
some
preliminary
discussions,
there
maybe
a
charge
for
a,
what
amounts
to
an
initial
consultation
the
rule
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well
let
me
refer
the
court
to
a
definition
of
engineering
services
in
professional
policy
10-g
which
was
adopted
by
the
engineers
in
1972
and
which
is
the
basis
for
their
restriction
of
this
practice
to
real
estate
construction.
prior
to
that
time
under
policy
10-f
it
applied
to
everything
as
we
read
it
at
least
it
literally
did.
it
defines
engineering
services
as
including
pre-feasibility
and
feasibility
studies,
so
that
comprehensive
and
general
planning,
preliminary
studies
preparation
of
drawings,
plans,
designs,
specifications.
in
short,
the
rule
defining
engineering
services
recognizes
as
there
maybe
paid
services
that
amount
to
fairly
preliminary
conversation,
preliminary
studies
and
that--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
it
does
not
--
it
is
against
the--
it
is
an
engineering
service
and
therefore
they
cannot
do
that
either,
they
cannot
quote
a
price
or
they
cannot
even
tell
what
their
hourly
rates
are?
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
until
they
have
negotiated,
until
they
have
been
accepted
by
the
client.
thank
you
your
honors.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
rule
forbids
that.
