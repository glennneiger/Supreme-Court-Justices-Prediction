mr.
lee
loevinger
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
national
society
of
professional
engineers
the
petitioner
here
appears
in
the
most
extraordinary
position.
it
is
opposing
the
government
in
advocating
the
public
interest
by
arguing
for
an
ethical
principle
which
protects
the
public
against
injury
and
clients
against
cheating.
the
government
on
the
other
hand
takes
the
position
that
these
matters
are
not
matters
for
consideration
by
the
court
because
it
invokes
the
rubric
of
per
se,
indeed
as
i
read
the
governments
brief
the
term
public
interest
does
not
appear
in
it
once.
the
principle
that
we
sustain
that
clears
the
solicitation
of
engineering
work
by
competitive
bidding
before
consultation
with
the
client
or
determination
of
the
scope
of
the
work
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
therefore
unethical.
the
alternative
method
of
solicitation
of
work
by
bidding
is
the
traditional,
ethical
method
which
involves
an
initial
selection
of
an
engineer
by
qualification,
with
fees
proposed
after
consultation
with
the
client
and
after
determination
of
the
scope
of
the
work.
it
is
basic
to
understand
that
engineering
involves
solving
practical
problems
by
the
application
of
science,
there
is
a
great
deal
of
testimony
on
this
subject.
so
that
each
engineering
problem
is
essentially
unique
and
indeed
each
engineering
solution
is
really
a
new
scientific
invention.
to
determine
the
nature
and
the
scope
of
engineering
problems
and
their
solution
requires
substantial
consultation
and
negotiation
between
engineer
and
client.
the
fee
is
then
calculated
and
the
client
is
perfectly
free
to
accept
or
reject
any
fee
that
is
calculated
and
to
engage
the
engineer
or
not
engage
the
engineer
and
go
on
and
negotiate
with
other
engineers
if
he
likes.
mr.
lee
loevinger
it
is
impractical
mr.
chief
justice,
it
has
been
found
that
it
does
not
work
just
it
is
like
trying
to
conduct
a
private
discussion
with
two
people.
i
do
not
know
that
there
is
any
specific
statement
on
this
subject,
there
is
explicit
testimony
that
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
a
client
from
negotiating
with
as
many
engineers
as
he
likes
even
on
the
same
day.
mr.
lee
loevinger
he
is
free
to
negotiate
with
second
or
third
or
fourth
or
fifth
as
many
as
his
patience
will
sustain.
mr.
lee
loevinger
sir
i
am
sorry.
mr.
lee
loevinger
no
sir,
there
are
no
charges
made,
there
is
no
engagement,
there
is
no
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
client
at
this
stage
of
the
proceedings.
mr.
lee
loevinger
this
principle
incidentally
has
four
important
exceptions.
in
the
first
place
it
is
confined
exclusively
to
the
design
to
work
related
to
the
design
of
real
estate
structures,
it
does
not
apply
to
research
and
development
work,
it
does
not
apply
to
study
contracts,
it
does
not
apply
to
so
called
turnkey
contracts,
engineering
works
that
relates
to
the
design
of
products
to
be
manufactured
is
not
involved
in
this
principle
for
the
very
good
reason
that
products
are
tested
before
they
are
sold.
the
reason
that
this
applies
is
that
real
estate
structures
are
not
tested,
there
are
not
prototypes.
r&d
work
on
the
other
hand
results
in
a
prototype.
a
prototype
is
thoroughly
tested
before
it
is
exposed
to
the
public
whereas
real
estate
structures
are
occupied
by
the
public.
there
is
no
chance
for
testing
them,
if
a
building
falls
down
the
public
is
injured.
it
is
exclusively
confined
to
matters
that
immediately
affect
public
interest.
mr.
lee
loevinger
i
do
not
say
it
is
an
exception
to
the
per
se
rule
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
say
that
the
per
se
rule
does
not
apply.
the
argument
for
the
per
se
rule
applies
because
of
the
strange
construction
which
says
that
because
this
some
how
or
other
affects
price,
therefore
it
is
price
fixing,
therefore
the
per
se
rule
applies,
actually
it
is
an
entirely
circular
argument.
mr.
lee
loevinger
yes
sir,
precisely.
mr.
lee
loevinger
yes
mr.
chief
justice
that
as
i
understood
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
question
that
this
applies
only
to
real
estate
structures
precisely
because
they
are
not
subject
to
testing.
if
you
are
designing
equipment
for
sale
whether
it
is
automobiles
or
gadgets
or
jewelery
or
whatever
these
are
articles
that
are
designed
and
manufactured
in
prototype
and
tested
before
sale.
consequently
the
public
has
the
protection
of
such
testing
and
there
are
many
opportunities
for
testing.
mr.
lee
loevinger
there
is
in
fact
testimony
on
that
precise
subject
which
points
out
that
the
building
codes
are
not
adequate
substitutes
for
the
code
of
ethics
because
they
are
usually
behind
times,
because
they
are
not
effectively
enforced
because
they
do
not
subject
to
buildings
to
the
same
kind
of
tests
as
they
get
from
the
engineer
who
was
on
top
of
the
job.
in
any
event,
we
argue
that
to
say
that
because
there
may
be
laws
that
relate
to
the
same
subject,
therefore
ethics
are
not
applicable,
it
is
inappropriate
as
to
say
that
because
there
are
laws
against
homicide
therefore
we
do
not
need
the
sixth
commandment.
mr.
lee
loevinger
yes
sir
that
is
one
of
the
incidents
that
was
testified
too
by
witness
whom
we
call
probably
no
case
has
ever
come
before
this
court
involving
the
application
of
the
rule
of
reason,
in
which
there
is
been
testimony
that
has
been
so
inclusive.
we
had
as
a
witness
the
head
of
the
company
that
ensures
over
60%
of
the
professional
engineers
and
architects
of
the
country
and
who
had
over
a
period
of
17
or
18
years
personally
investigated
or
in
the
later
years
when
it
became
more,
personally
supervised
the
investigation
of
every
malpractice
claim
that
arose
for
this
entire
group
of
engineers.
he
kept
statistics
on
the
claims,
on
their
causes
he
investigated
the
conditions
under
which
the
solicitation
occurred
and
as
matter
of
fact
he
concluded
and
the
testimony
stands
uncontroverted
in
the
record
that
there
was
a
high
correlation
between
the
awarding
of
engineering
jobs
by
bidding
and
claims
of
malpractice,
inadequacy
or
negligence
and
it
reached
such
a
point
that
his
company
finally
concluded
that
they
would
not
issue
malpractice
insurance
when
there
is
any
evidence
of
that
a
job
has
been
awarded
by
bidding.
that
is
how
inclusive
the
evidence
was.
in
fact
he
testified
to
over
17500
claims
that
he
had
investigated
and
at
the
time
of
his
testimony,
the
claims
were
coming
in
at
the
rate
of
10
a
day
of
which
more
than
one
every
single
day
involved
injury
or
death
to
a
member
of
the
public.
that
is
how
ubiquitous
is
the
threat
we
are
confronting
and
this
case
is
and
the
government
takes
the
position
that
this
is
irrelevant.
they
do
no
take
position
--
simply
it
is
not
true
they
say
it
should
not
be
considered
by
the
court
and
the
courts
below
believed
them
and
proceeded
on
that
basis
and
that
is
why
we
are
here.
now,
there
is
a
testimony
of
many
eminent
engineers
which
stands
essentially
uncontroverted
in
the
record
as
to
the
public
values
of
the
ethical
method
of
awarding
engineering
jobs
and
of
the
bidding
method.
in
the
first
place,
the
ethical
method
encourages
a
free
exchange
of
information
among
engineers,
the
exchange
of
technical
and
scientific
information
whereas
bidding
tends
to
make
them
like
businessmen
who
seek
to
hoard
trade
secrets
and
there
is
a
public
value
in
this.
there
is
no
government
response
to
this
point
and
there
were
no
findings
by
any
of
the
courts
below.
the
second
--
the
ethical
method
was
well
testified,
produces
completely
adequate
plans
which
permits
competitive
bidding
at
the
construction
phase
which
incidentally
costs
about
20
times
as
much
as
the
total
cost
of
engineering
and
therefore
increases
and
permits
competition
in
construction
whereas
bidding
results
in
inadequate
and
incomplete
plans
of
the
specifications
and
therefore
frustrates
competitive
bidding
at
the
construction
phase.
there
is
no
response
to
this
point
in
the
government
brief
and
no
findings
below.
mr.
lee
loevinger
mr.
justice
stevens,
this
is
not
an
anti-competitive
method.
as
we
point
out
and
as
i
believe
our
--.
mr.
lee
loevinger
no
sir.
mr.
lee
loevinger
it
is
relevant
because
our
ethical
principles
being
attacked
by
the
government
under
the
antitrust
laws
but
as
we
explain,
in
fact,
bidding
is
false
deceptive.
bidding
cheats
clients
because
it
is
not
in
fact
genuine
competition.
let
me
give
you
an
example
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
are
two
examples
in
the
record.
the
government
had
a
massive
discovery
procedure
and
got
thousands
of
documents
and
incidentally
this
old
illusion,
i
am
sorry
to
divert
from
answering
your
question
but
i
will
--
mr.
lee
loevinger
it
is
different
because
when
bidding
is,
when
there
is
bidding
for
engineering
services,
the
consumer
does
not
know
what
he
is
getting.
there
is
no
way
to
specify
what
it
is
getting.
mr.
lee
loevinger
no,
there
is
possible
way
because
you
do
not
know
if
a
sophisticated
buyer
comes
in
and
says
i
want
to
construct
a
bridge
from
brooklyn
to
manhattan,
how
much
will
you
charge
me
to
design
it.
there
is
no
way
to
tell
what
he
is
talking
about.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
is
in
the
record
an
example
of
almost
this
kind
of
proposal
which
the
government
put
in
by
way
of
exhibit
and
which
it
cites
sights
in
its
brief
as
an
example
of
an
invitation
to
bid
which
the
metropolitan
transit
authority
of
new
york
talks
about
an
invitation
to
present
engineering
bids
on
some
--
they
do
not
even
say
how
many
transportation
centers,
some
centers
that
serve
five
communities
and
this
invitation
consists
of
five
pages
of
questions,
you
do
not
even
have
to
be
an
engineer
to
read
this
invitation
and
find
out
it
does
not
specify
anything.
there
is
not
a
vaguest,
you
cannot--
mr.
lee
loevinger
computers
are
not
in
the
same
situation.
mr.
lee
loevinger
it
is
the
fact
that
in
the
situation
and
in
the
special
situation
presented
on
the
record
here,
it
is
impossible
to
specify
in
advance
either
what
is
sought
or
what
is
being
offered,
the
buyer
cannot
specify,
no
matter
how
expert
he
his,
he
cannot
know
what
it
is
that
he
seeks
because
he
has
a
problem,
he
does
not
have
a
notion
of
the
solution
to
the
problem.
he
does
not
know
how
the
problem
is
going
to
be
solved
until
we.
mr.
lee
loevinger
i
do
not,
as
far
as
i
am
aware
that
the
medical
problems
are
encompassed
to
a
somewhat
smaller
scope
and
do
not
involve
this.
mr.
lee
loevinger
no
he
does
not
have
to
understand
the
answer,
but
the
client
that
goes
to
engineer
does
not
know
the
question.
mr.
lee
loevinger
i
am
not
prepared
to
say
that
it
does
because
no
such
record
has
been
made,
we
have
a
very
extensive
record
here
which
presents
precisely
what
the
problems
are
in
engineering
and
as
i
believe
our
brief,
our
initial
brief
points
out
there
are
substantial
differences
between
the
engineering
profession
in
this
respect
and
the
other
learned
professions
law
and
medicine,
that
the
engineer
deals
with
problems
of
different
kind
of
order,
of
a
different
magnitude,
of
a
different
client.
engineers
design
vast
structures,
they
do
not
treat
individuals
by
and
large
whereas
the
lawyer
treats
with
the
individual.
there
is,
as
this
court
has
held
certain,
there
are
certain
functions
which
this
court
has
said
in
bates,
can
be
considered
as
repetitive
and
even
as
routine,
i
understand
there
is
some
differences
among
the
court
on
that
point
but
we
accept
the
majority
opinion
of
the
court.
but
the
testimony
is
clear
and
uncontroverted,
that
there
are
no
such
matters
in
engineering
that
when
a
client
goes
to
an
engineer,
the
definition
of
his
problem
becomes
a
matter
that
requires
expensive
consultation
and
negotiation
before
it
is
possible
to
begin
to
formulate
a
solution
and
after
the
beginning
of
the
formulation
of
the
solution,
the
testimony
was,
it
took
about
a
third
of
the
total
amount
of
work
before
you
arrived
at
that
point
and
then
you
formulate
a
solution.
then
the
engineer
proposes
a
fee,
the
client
is
still
free
to
reject
it
and
then
to
talk
to
other
engineers.
mr.
lee
loevinger
this
is
not
price
fixing
indeed
this
is
antithesis
of
price
fixing.
it
is
inherent
and
the
principle
that
we
are
arguing
for,
that
every
single
job
should
be
separately
negotiated
and
a
fee
separately
arrived
at
based
upon
the
scope
of
the
work
involved.
i
can
imagine
nothing
more
antithetical
to
price
fixing
than
the
principle
that
we
here
advocate.
mr.
lee
loevinger
precisely.
it
is
not
price
fixing
sir,
the
most
that
can
be
said
of
it
is
that
it
affects
the
time
and
manner
of
arriving
at
the
price.
in
that
respect,
we
believe
that
it
is
an
fortiori
case
under
chicago
board
of
trade.
mr.
lee
loevinger
it
does
not
say
anything
about
that,
mr.
justice.
mr.
lee
loevinger
that
is
correct.
mr.
lee
loevinger
well,
indeed
it
has
been
testified
that
a
client
may
have
serially
or
whole
conversation.
mr.
lee
loevinger
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
lee
loevinger
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
remember
goldfarb
correctly,
it
was
specifically
recited
in
your
opinion
that
no
lawyer
even
asked
for
additional
information
about
the
matter.
he
simply
quoted
the
fees
scheduled
price.
this
principle
requires
engineers
to
get
in
and
find
out
what
the
scope
of
the
work
is,
and
separately
to
consider
and
ascertain
what
this
involves
and
to
arrive
at
an
independent
judgment.
mr.
lee
loevinger
ye
sir.
this
has
been
testified.
mr.
lee
loevinger
it
would
be
forbidden
if
he
did
it
simply
on
the
basis
of
saying
tell
me
how
much
the
other
man
--
mr.
lee
loevinger
if
it
is
his
independent
judgment
that
this
inappropriate
figure
it
is
not
forbidden,
no
sir,
it
is
encouraged
and
it
indeed
it
occurs,
there
is
testimony
to
that
affect.
mr.
lee
loevinger
it
might
be
higher
or
lower,
correct
sir.
mr.
lee
loevinger
response.
i
prefer
that
word,
yes
sir.
mr.
lee
loevinger
yes
that
is
precisely
what
this
is.
the
engineer
is
not
to
give
the
client
such
information
until
he
has
had
enough
negotiation
and
consultation
with
the
client
to
be
able
to
ascertain
the
scope
of
the
work.
that
is
the
restriction.
mr.
lee
loevinger
well
he
is
not
--
well
it
is
an
initial
selection
it
is
not
involve
an
engagement
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
lee
loevinger
no,
it
has
to
negotiate
the
scope
of
the
work,
which
involves
the
price
of
--
the
fee
for
the
services.
but
it
is
impossible
for
an
engineer
to
talk
to
a
client
until
a
client
has
selected
that
engineer
for
the
purposes
of
conversation.
this
is
why
--
this
is
simply
a
inherent
in
the
nature
of
the
process.
mr.
lee
loevinger
yes
sir.
no
question
about
it.
mr.
lee
loevinger
yes
sir,
that
is
correct.
mr.
lee
loevinger
this
happens,
yes
sir.
and
no
doubt
about
it.
i
find
that
i
have
only
ten
minutes
left
mr.
chief
justice
i
think
that
the
basic
principle
has
been
explained
to
the
court
i
would
like
to
resume
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
lee
loevinger
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
the
last
colloquy
illustrates
the
difficulty
of
per
se
rule
as
applied
in
this
case.
mr.
shapiro
did
not
try
the
case,
i
believe
he
is
not
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
record
and
his
application
of
10-g
is
simply
erroneous.
mr.
justice
stevens
is
entirely
correct
in
negotiating
the
scope
of
the
work
and
the
possibility
of
engagement
by
a
client,
there
is
no
charge
and
this
is
eminently
clear.
the
difficulty
is
that
you
can
not
take
a
simple
rule
particularly
when
drafted
by
engineers,
you
can
not
even
take
one
drafted
by
lawyers,
but
you
can
take
a
general
rule
drafted
by
engineers
and
apply
it
without
understanding
the
circumstances
out
of
which
it
grew
any
more
than
you
can
take
the
sherman
act
and
talk
about
the
rule
of
reason,
the
per
se
rule,
and
all
the
rest
of
this,
without
having
some
idea
of
the
interpretations
made
by
this
and
other
courts
and
indeed
the
engineers
had
a
formal
body
known
as
the
board
of
ethical
review
which
made
these
interpretations
and
there
are
these
interpretations
and
there
is
a
body
of
testimony
relating
to
this
matter
which
makes
it
perfectly
clear
that
mr.
shapiro
misinterprets
section,
policy
10-g.
incidentally
earlier
in
his
argument
and
he
referred
to
policy
10-f
which
was
superseded
by
policy
10-g
and
simply
is
not
in
effect
and
is
not
involved
and
it
is
not
issue
in
this
case
--
mr.
lee
loevinger
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
the
difficulty
with
simultaneous
conversations
is
that
they
are
little
bit
like
simultaneous
consultations
with
the
doctors,
it
is
very
difficult
to
see
how
you
could
get
simultaneous--
mr.
lee
loevinger
there
is
no,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record,
nothing
in
the
rule
that
i
am
aware
of
that
forbids.
mr.
lee
loevinger
well
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
i
am
familiar
with
the
record
i
know
the
record,
i
have
read
the
briefs
and
if
there
is
anything
in
it,
i
would
like
to
have
it
referred
to
because
i
am
not
familiar
with
it.
the
rule
is
as
it
stands.
and
there
is
simply
no
testimony.
mr.
lee
loevinger
there
is
testimony
that
once
a
client
has
begun
talking
to
an
engineer
he
is
to
complete
his
conversations
with
that
engineer
before
consulting
another
that
--
mr.
lee
loevinger
barging
in,
in
the
middle
of
the
consultation,
that
is
correct,
yes
sir.
mr.
lee
loevinger
i
would
not
say
that
they
are
permitted
they
are
certainly
not
favored.
mr.
lee
loevinger
the
question
that
as
i,
there
were
17
witnesses
i
do
not
believe
the
question
was
asked
to
any
of
them.
mr.
lee
loevinger
i
think
as
a
practical
matter
that
--
mr.
lee
loevinger
i
think
it
is
not
a
practical,
it
is
about
as
impractical
a
simultaneous
consultation
with
doctors
i
believe
this
is
the
difficulty--
mr.
lee
loevinger
means
that
if
an
engineer
is
asked
to
come
in
and
give
a
bid
prior
to
the
opportunity
to
discuss
with
the
client,
the
scope
and
nature
of
the
work
that
he
shall
not
do
it.
and
that
the
testimony
is
pretty
clear
on
that.
mr.
lee
loevinger
mr.
chief
justice,
the
repetitive
bid
or
the
repetitive
project
is
a
false
issue.
if
what
a
client
wants
is
a
building
just
exactly
like
the
one
that
has
been
erected
all
he
has
to
do
is
to
use
the
plans,
specifications
for
that
building.
he
has
already
got
them,
by
definition
he
has
got
the
building
he
has
added
erecting.
mr.
lee
loevinger
the
testimony
is
clear
that
there
not
two
identical
buildings,
you
can
not
build
it
in
the
same
place
and
at
different
place
you
have
got
different
problems,
you
got
different
problems,
subsoil
problems,
you
got
different
wind
problems,
you
have
got
different
traffic
problems.
there
are
host
of
different
problems
and
in
order
even
to
determine
the
difference
between
partially
repetitive
projects
you
have
to
consult
with
the
client
and
find
out
where
do
you
want
that
other
building?
where
is
it
going
to
be
designed?
what
is
its
purpose,
what
is
the
soil
going
to
be
like?
there
are
host
of
problems,
there
are
explored
at
great
length
in
the
record
and
this
is
precisely
the
problem.
there
is
not,
but
there
are
identical
problems,
you
cannot
do
this.
and
simply,
that
is
so
hypothetical
simply
does
not--
mr.
lee
loevinger
there
is
nothing
under
the
rule
of
ethics
that
relates
to
this,
that
is
a
matter
of
fact
we
assume
that
this
is
--
mr.
lee
loevinger
this
point
he
has,
he
is
–
he
has
got--
mr.
lee
loevinger
you
can
say
that
but
he
has
terminated,
he
has
terminated
those
talks
with
the
first
man,
the
consultation
has
been
completed
and
this
in
fact
does
happen
as
far
as
--
mr.
lee
loevinger
presumably,
this
is
conceivable.
let
us
say
i
do
not
know
i
understand
that
the
practice
is
not
exactly
like
that
of
used
car
dealers
but
there
is
nothing
that
relates
to
this
the
testimony
is
clear
that,
that
there
can
be
and
are
serial
consultation.
mr.
lee
loevinger
well
it
is
not.
mr.
lee
loevinger
i
do
not
know,
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
have
to
say
that
the
record
again,
this
is
one
of
those
things
that
despite
everything
was
not
explored
either
on
examination
or
cross
examination.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
how
the
conversations
progressed
to
the
point
where
the
first
engineer
had
been
fully
consulted,
had
made
a
fee
proposal,
it
is
for
the
scope
of
the
work,
the
man
said,
okay
now
i
want
to
go
see
somebody
else
that
that
is
termination
for
the
purposes
of
this
thing,
the
point
is
these
are
not
words
of
art.
we
have
no
problem
with
the
concept
of
this
maybe
and
artistically
stated,
indeed
we
have
stated
it
from
the
very
beginning
that
it
can
be
reformulated,
that
the
principle
can
be
restated
in
any
manner
that
is
necessary
in
order
to
express
it
clearly.
mr.
lee
loevinger
when
he
is
asked
to
give
a
fee
bid
before
he
has
had
an
opportunity
to
have
studied
the
nature
and
scope
of
the
work.
mr.
lee
loevinger
the
engineers
considered
impractical
mr.
justice
white,
they
consider
simultaneous
that
their
stepping
on
each
others
stone
--
mr.
lee
loevinger
at
least
one
of
them
in
fact,
yes
should.
the
difference,
what
this
basically
all
comes
down
to
is,
that
if
you
apply
per
se
rule,
there
is
no
way
to
accommodate
what
the
government
and
the
court
of
appeals
concede
to
be
a
legitimate
objective
to
the
demands
of
the
antitrust
law.
it
is
only
by
the
application
of
the
rule
of
reason
that
the
law
can
be
accommodated
to
what
both
the
government
and
the
court
of
appeals
concede
to
be
a
legitimate
objective.
