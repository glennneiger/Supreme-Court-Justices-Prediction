chief
justice
warren
e.

we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
penn
central
transportation
company
against
the
city
of
new
york.
mr.
gribbon,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
total
debt.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
tax.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
do
not
question
the
right
to
the
city
of
new
york
to
take
this
entire
property,
do
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
not
the
point
that
in
the
situation
you
are
referring
to
as
distinguished
from
now,
it
is
mr.
justice
stewart
is
referring
to,
the
taking
some
but
not
all
or
the
taking
one
but
not
all
the
others.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
there
a
matter
of
equal
protection
here
somewhere?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
theory
behind
the
take
--
i
will
avoid
the
use
of
the
word
'taking',
the
limitation
because
it
is
in
historic
place
and
historic
monument
is
that
that
is
for
the
benefit
of
everyone.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
you
say
if
it
is
for
the
benefit
of
everybody,
everybody
should
pay
for
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
gribbon,
back
in
1911,
one
plan
considered
it
was
a
20-story
tower
on
the
property,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
has
anything
along
that
line
been
suggested
that
commission
here
at
this
point?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
adjacent
to
the
contrary,
but
the
other
way.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
20
years
ago,
30
years
ago
before
we
were
as
much
concerned
with
the
past
as
we
are
now
and
preserving
the
past,
you
had
built
over
the
penn
central
station
without
using
any
part
of
the
station
but
just
build
over
to
60-70-storied
hotel.
the
commission
now
decided
that
that
was
more
in
the
appearance,
the
aesthetic
value
of
this
landmark.
they
wanted
to
tear
it
down.
i
suppose
there
is
not
much
doubt
that
you
would
expect
compensation
for
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
there
is
no
difference
in
the
taking
aspect
today
in
the
present
situation
than
in
the
one
i
hypothesized?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
terms
of
fifth
amendment
principles.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
gribbon,
down
near
the
white
house
across
the
street
from
the
hay-adams
hotel
there
is
a
historic
church.
i
suppose
it
goes
back
well
over
100
years,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
st.
john's
church.
i
would
assume,
and
i
think
you
would
assume
with
me
that
the
land
underlying
that
church
is
a
very
valuable
piece
of
property
for
an
office
building
or
another
hotel
or
what
not.
if
that
were
taken
--
if
the
church
which
presumably
has
fee
title
to
that
property
began
negotiations
for
the
sale
of
it
to
hilton
hotel
corporation
or
someone
to
build
a
hotel
there
and
some
effort
was
made
by
the
congress
to
preserve
it,
would
that
be
a
taking
in
your
view
if
they
said,
“no,
you
cannot
tear
that
down
and
build
a
hilton
hotel.
you
cannot
do
anything
with
it.
you
have
got
to
keep
it
the
way
it
is.”
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
in
that
process
or
that
inquiry
it
developed
that
that
church
was
the
result
of
many,
many
contributions
by
people
that
the
church
corporation
as
such
did
not
ever
put
a
single
dollar
into
it.
it
was
all
gift
money.
would
that
make
any
difference?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
would
be
entitled
to
get
the
compensation
for
the
highest
invest
use
of
that
land
as
of
today?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
presumably,
at
the
moment,
the
highest
and
best
use
would
be
a
hotel
site.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
would
of
course
be
limited
to
the
height
limits
of
washington
d.c.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
800-feet
or
something.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
koerner.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
do
not
contend
this
is
a
zoning
case,
do
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
applied
to
one
particular
unit?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
it
not
be
different
from
the
case
we
have
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
would
it
be
different
to
a
constitutional
--?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
which
isn't
counsel
a
valuable
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
which
is
for
the
benefit
of
whom?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
do
not
think
the
entire
community
should
bear
the
cost
of
the
benefits
for
the
entire
community?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
suppose
instead
of
this
being
owned
by
the
penn
central,
this
had
been
a
private
residence
of
great
historic
importance,
commodore
vanderbilt’s
house
or
some
such
thing,
and
the
landmark
commission
wanted
to
take
it.
what
kind
of
a
return
do
you
have
on
a
private
residence
to
use
the
measurement
that
you
are
suggesting
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
about
my
hypothetical
question
to
mr.
gribbon
on
st.
john’s
church
over,
by
the
white
house
by
lafayette
park?
do
you
think
the
st.
john’s
church
could
get
the
reasonable
market
value
of
the
land
less
the
cost
of
demolition?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
if
they
wanted
to
do
what
the
national
presbyterian
church
did
to
sell
its
downtown
church
for
a
very
large
office
building
site
and
move
out
to
the
outskirts
where
the
parishioners
can
get
to
the
church
more
rapidly?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
fixing
value?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
this
make
any
difference
to
the
constitutional
issues
in
this
case
whether
they
were
totally
tax-exempt
or
paid
the
full
tax
that
everyone
else
pays?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
in
this
respect
they
are
in
the
same
posture.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
same
posture
as
st.
john’s
church?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mrs.
wald!
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
without
compensation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
beneficial
use
that
my
farmer
friend
up
at
manassas
has
in
mind
is
to
leave
it
to
his
children
or
to
sell
it
as
the
case
maybe.
and
he
can
get
$1,500
an
acre
for
it
in
some
places
now.
are
you
suggesting
the
united
states
government
or
any
government
could
take
that
property
without
paying
him
the
going
rate?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
get
back
to
the
hypothetical
that
i
gave
mr.
gribbon
and
see
what
your
answer
is.
the
national
presbyterian
church
was
surely
a
historic
place
on
connecticut
avenue.
out
in
front
of
the
building
was
the
statue
of
john
witherspoon,
one
of
the
signers
of
the
declaration
i
think.
they
contracted
to
sell
it
for
$3
or
4
million.
suppose
after
they
contracted
to
sell
it
in
order
to
build
a
new
church
further
out
and
had
this
$3
or
4
million
contract,
the
district
of
columbia
had
said,
“no,
that
is
going
to
be
a
landmark.
you
cannot
sell
it.”
you
have
got
the
going
market
value
fixed
by
a
contract
an
arm's
length
contract
with
the
national
broadcasters
association
to
put
the
building
up
there.
do
you
suggest
the
district
of
columbia
under
any
statute
could
have
taken
that
property
without
paying
them
for
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
demolish.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
could
be
zero.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
mean
you
are
going
to
make
him
do
something
with
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
he
just
wants
to
board
it
up?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
who
should
pay
the
$10,000
a
year
insurance
premiums
on
it
and
public
liability
in
the
meantime?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
profit
have
you
got
on
a
boarded
up
building?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
boarded
it
up
because
the
government
from
your
point
of
view
would
not
let
them
sell
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
gribbon?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
your
brief
at
page
17
you
cite
this
court’s
opinion
in
fuller,
where
you
say
that
the
government
in
a
condonation
case
can
exclude
from
consideration
of
the
jury
the
value
that
maybe
added
by
the
fact
that
the
government
build
a
post
office
near
the
site
80
years
ago.
is
that
substantial
to
your
argument
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
expected
use,
is
that
what
you
said?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
is
that
different
from
the
highest
and
best
potential
use?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
term
obsolete
when
a
church
could
show
that
it
has
a
contract
to
sell
the
church
and
the
site
for
$4.5
million?
does
that
not
give
some
evidence
of
the
highest
and
best
use?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
highest
and
best
use
always
is
restrained
by
the
permissible
use.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
77-444,
penn
central
transportation
company
against
new
york
city
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
brennan.
chief
justice
warren
e.

thank
you
mr.
justice
brennan.
