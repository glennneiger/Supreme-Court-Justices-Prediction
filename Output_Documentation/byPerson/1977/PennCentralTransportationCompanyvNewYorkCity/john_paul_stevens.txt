justice
john
paul
stevens
mrs.
wald,
can
i
just
interrupt
because
it
goes
to
what
you
are
reciting
out.
has
the
united
states
ever
imposed
the
regulation
on
private
use
of
private
property
for
historic
purposes
without
compensating
the
owner?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
has
never
done
anything
comparable
to
what
we
have
before
us
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
fair
to
say
that
the
federal
policy
has
always
been
where
there
is
a
public
benefit,
the
public
shall
pay?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
suppose
a
farmer
up
near
manassas
is
suddenly
informed
that
the
records
now
discover
an
important
part
of
the
battle
of
manassas
was
fought
on
his
farm.
therefore,
they
will
let
him
graze
his
cows
and
raise
some
grain,
but
that
he
cannot
sell
it.
it
is
just
going
to
be
preserved
for
the
benefit
of
the
rural
people.
do
you
mean
to
suggest
that
they
do
not
have
to
pay
him
the
going
rate
per
acre
for
that
farm?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah,
the
chief
justiceâ€™s
question
was
a
constitutional
question
and
that
is
because
that
is
what
we
have
in
this
case,
not
you
happened
to
have
at
the
moment,
a
federal
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
what
we
have
to
do
in
this
case.
