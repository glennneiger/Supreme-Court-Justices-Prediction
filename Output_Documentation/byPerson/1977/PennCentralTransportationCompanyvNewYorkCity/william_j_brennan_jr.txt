justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
case
is
here
from
the
new
york
state
court
of
appeals.
the
grand
central
terminal
in
new
york
city
back
in
1967
was
designated
a
land
mark
by
the
landmarks
preservation
commission
which
administers
new
york
city's
landmark
preservation
law.
although,
the
appellant
the
penn
central
transportation
company
which
owns
the
terminal
opposed
the
landmark
designation
before
the
landmark's
preservation
commission.
it
did
not
seek
judicial
review
of
the
designation
decision.
however,
in
1968,
penn
central
entered
in
to
an
agreement
with
a
british
firm
to
construct
a
multi-storey
office
building
above
the
terminal.
it
was
to
be
a
55
storey
office
building
and
penn
central
was
to
receive
a
$1
million
annually
as
rental,
during
construction,
and
at
least
$3
million
annually
as
rental,
thereafter.
because
of
the
terminal's
landmark
designation
however,
the
structure
could
not
be
built
without
the
permission
of
the
landmarks
preservation
commission
because
that's
what
the
landmarks
preservation
law
provides
and
penn
central
applied
for
that
permission
and
the
commission
denied
permission.
again
penn
central
didn't
seek
judicial
review
as
a
denial
but
brought
this
suit
in
the
new
york
courts
claiming
at
the
landmarks
preservation
law
has
taken
it's
property
without
just
compensation,
in
violation
of
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
rejected
that
claim
and
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
again
the
only
issue
before
us
is
whether
the
state
court
was
correct
in
holding
at
the
restrictions
imposed
by
the
landmark's
law
to
not
effect
the
taking
of
penn
central's
property
for
public
use
within
the
meaning
of
the
fifth
amendment
which
of
course
is
made
applicable
to
the
states,
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
agreeing
with
the
view,
that
the
restrictions
do
not
affect
the
taking,
we
rely
on
decision
cited
in
the
opinion
that
hold
that
when
state
tribunals
reasonably
conclude
as
did
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
here
that
the
common
good
will
be
promoted
by
prohibiting
particular
contemplated
uses
of
land,
land
use
regulations
that
destroy
or
adversely
affect
real
property
and
thus
may
nevertheless
be
constitutional.
now
penn
central's
position
stated
boldly
appears
to
be
that
the
only
means
of
ensuring
that
selected
owners
are
not
singled
out
to
endure
financial
hardship
for
no
reason,
is
to
hold
then
any
restriction
imposed
on
individual
landmarks
pursuant
to
the
new
york
scheme
is
a
taking
without
more
requiring
the
payment
of
just
compensation.
we
find
no
merit
in
that
argument
but
we
see
no
basis
for
disagreement
with
the
new
york
court
that
the
restrictions
imposed
are
substantially
related
to
the
promotion
of
the
general
welfare.
we
therefore
as
i
said
affirm.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
dissents
and
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
