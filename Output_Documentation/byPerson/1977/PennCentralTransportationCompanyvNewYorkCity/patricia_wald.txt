ms.
patricia
wald
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
has
a
vital
interest
in
these
proceedings
today.
congress
and
the
executive
have
declared
in
many
statutes
that
it
is
a
national
policy,
“the
historical
and
cultural
foundations
of
the
nation”
should
be
preserved
as
a
living
part
of
our
community
life
and
development
in
order
to
give
our
people
a
sense
of
orientation.”
now
the
federal
government
is
deeply
involved
in
historical
preservation
in
many
ways
and
i
will
allude
to
them
only
briefly.
number
one,
it
designates
and
preserves
historic
landmarks
on
its
own
public
lands.
two,
it
sometimes
utilizes
the
power
of
eminent
domain
to
acquire
sites
of
national
historic
significance.
number
three,
since
1966
it
maintains
a
national
registry
of
historic
buildings
which
have
local,
state,
city,
and
national
significance
and
now
contains
15,000
such
buildings.
fourth,
it
provides
financial
aid
to
states
and
cities
so
that
they
can
survey
their
historic
preservation
problems,
formulate
plans,
and
embark
on
preservation
projects
to
preserve
their
treasures.
fifth,
all
federal
agencies
pursuant
to
the
1966
act
and
to
an
executive
order,
who
license
projects
or
spend
money
on
projects
in
any
state
must
take
account
of
the
need
to
preserve
historic
sites
which
are
registered
or
which
are
eligible
for
registration.
finally,
there
are
several
very
specific
enactments
including
the
national
environmental
protection
act
which
requires
need
for
impact
statements
to
assess
the
impact
of
historic
sites
that
might
be
affected
by
proposed
projects.
ms.
patricia
wald
i
do
not
believe
it
has
directly
done
so.
ms.
patricia
wald
not
to
my
knowledge,
but
may
i
add
that
it
does
provide
subsidization
to
local
groups
to
embark
upon
some
of
their
projects
pursuant
to
laws
like
the
new
york
city
landmark
law
which
use
a
regulatory
framework
for
preservation.
ms.
patricia
wald
i
believe
that
that
is
an
overstatement
for
the
following
reasons.
naturally,
the
federal
government
has
relied
primarily
upon
state
and
local
governments
and
their
police
power
and
their
particular
historic
preservation
laws
to
bring
about
the
preservation
of
buildings
except
where
those
buildings
are
on
public
lands.
however,
we
do
have
several
instances
not
for
historic
preservation
but
for
other
uses
which
raise
a
similar
question
where
the
federal
government
to
its
regulatory
powers,
does
in
fact
impose
restrictions
upon
land
use
which
it
does
not
compensate
for
by
eminent
domain.
in
the
area
of
historic
preservation
to
my
knowledge,
you
were
correct,
justice
stevens,
that
we
do
not
do
it
directly.
ms.
patricia
wald
if
we
are
referring
now,
as
i
believe
you
are
to
the
national
government
taking
such
action,
then
right
now
the
national
government
would
either
have
to
do
it
through
eminent
domain
or
through
a
state
or
local
government
which
had
jurisdiction.
we
do
not
have
any
statutes
on
the
books
to
my
knowledge
which
allow
us
to
have
a
national
historic
preservation
regulatory
framework
such
as
the
states
and
cities.
that
is
not
to
say,
your
honor,
and
certainly
we
do
not
have
the
question
before
us
today
that
it
would
not
be
possible
for
congress
to
enact
such.
ms.
patricia
wald
it
is
always
very
hazardous
to
pass
unconstitutional
questions
ahead
of
time.
ms.
patricia
wald
you
are
passing
on
a
statute,
of
course,
it
is
one
the
books
for
new
york
city.
if
the
federal
government
pursuant
to
a
federal
jurisdiction
pass
such
a
statute,
i
believe
that
if
properly
written
it
would
be
constitutional.
ms.
patricia
wald
without
compensation
in
the
sense
that
it
would
be
subject
to
the
same
test
which
we
suggest
constitutionally
apply
the
state
and
local
government.
if
it
became
so
onerous
to
the
landholder,
if
he
could
not
take
any
beneficial
uses
out
of
his
property,
that
it
would
become
a
taking
and
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
ms.
patricia
wald
i
am
not
suggesting
they
could
take
it,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
am
suggesting
that
a
valid
historical
landmark
statute
could
allow
them
to
restrict
its
usage
so
that
a
particular
historic
framework
or
particular
historic
use
would
not
be
violated.
now
i
believe
--
ms.
patricia
wald
i
am
sorry,
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
your
question,
mr.
justice
marshall.
ms.
patricia
wald
is
that
the
price
you
suggest
that
the
government
would
have
to
pay?
ms.
patricia
wald
i
believe
that
the
federal
government
could
indeed
enact
a
statute
which
would
not
require
them
to
pay
the
price
you
suggest,
the
going
rate
on
the
market
for
the
land
simply
because
they
had
restricted
its
uses
so
as
to
prevent
him
from
selling
it
to
the
supermarket.
ms.
patricia
wald
i
do
suggest
that
the
district
of
columbia
could
have
passed
a
regulation
which
required
after
designation
through
a
reasonable
mechanism
of
that
church
as
a
historical
site.
that
indeed
either
that
site
must
be
maintained
--
the
church
must
be
maintained,
or
if
it
were
sold,
the
successor
must
maintain
it
in
the
church
form.
and
i
believe
that
a
somewhat
similar
case,
the
benningson
(ph)
case
here
where
indeed
the
district
--
ms.
patricia
wald
no,
i
would
not
suggest
it.
ms.
patricia
wald
i
would
suggest
that
since
the
property
was
originally
--
its
original,
its
present
use
at
the
time
it
was
designated
was
as
a
church,
that
indeed
nobody
can
be
made
obviously
to
operate
a
church
if
they
do
not
want
to.
but
i
think
what
can
be
done
is
to
restrict
other
uses
of
the
property.
ms.
patricia
wald
certainly,
i
believe
the
statute
is
valid,
and
under
the
statute
if
it
wished
to
shut
down
the
station,
to
cease
operating,
to
demolish
the
--
ms.
patricia
wald
i
believe
that
the
courts,
although
it
is
not
in
the
statute
in
grand
central’s
case,
but
i
believe
that
the
new
york
courts
in
that
situation
if
they
did
not
want
to
operate
it
at
all
would
indeed
permit
them
to
cease
operating
it.
but
i
am
not
sure
that
it
would
permit
them
to
go
ahead
and
make
another
use
of
the
property.
ms.
patricia
wald
i
do
not
believe
that
the
constitution
require
the
compensation
to
be
paid
simply
because
they
decided
they
did
not
want
to
operate
it
anymore
as
a
railroad
station.
i
believe
that
they
would
be
before
a
taking
and
compensation
would
be
required.
under
existing
law,
they
would
be
required
to
find
some
beneficial
use
to
attempt
to
find
some
beneficial
use
that
did
not
violate
the
nature
of
the
preservation
law.
i
believe,
in
fact,
that
is
what
most
of
the
cases
this
court
has
held
in
the
past
would
suggest.
for
instance,
in
the
goldblatt
case.
the
case
said,
candidly
the
ordinates
completely
prohibited
the
pit
use
to
which
the
property
had
been
put
before.
that
was
completely
ruled
out.
yet,
the
court
held
that
was
not
a
taking
because
the
plaintiff
might
well
find
some
other
uses
for
the
property
or
there
had
not
been
any
showing
that
he
could
not.
there
had
been
cases
in
which
the
south
terminal
case
in
boston
where
the
epa
simply
said,
in
its
regulations
and
its
transportation
plan,
“you
may
not
use
'x'
percentage
of
parking
spaces
because
if
you
do
it
will
affect
the
clean
air
acts”
and
the
court
there
held
the
first
circuit
that
was
not
a
taking
because
even
though
you
could
not
use
those
spaces
for
parking
spaces,
for
which
they
had
originally
been
intended,
you
had
to
look
around
and
find
some
other
less
value
uses.
ms.
patricia
wald
that
is
pretty
much
the
test.
i
think
it
is
the
test
of
the
past
cases
here.
i
think
as
long
as
there
is
a
profitable
use
to
the
property,
there
has
not
been
a
taking
there
would
have
been
a
numerable
taking.
ms.
patricia
wald
certainly,
the
cases
do
not
tell
us
in
the
past.
they
leave
the
formula.
in
fact,
i
think
they
said
--
ms.
patricia
wald
“no
set
of
formula
has
a
reasonable
return
or
a
beneficial
use.”
ms.
patricia
wald
i
would
say
a
reasonable
return
is
a
beneficial
use.
ms.
patricia
wald
i
believe
so
and
i
believe
that
is
exactly
what
all
of
the
cases
have
said,
we
do
not
take
the
test
of
the
most
profitable
use.
most
recently
and
most
--
ms.
patricia
wald
i
certainly
believe
that
constitution
would
require
the
owner,
if
he
could
not
use
it
for
a
particular
purpose
to
be
able
to
go
out
and
find
the
most
profitable
use
consistent
with
the
point
of
the
regulation,
namely
the
preservation
of
the
landmark.
ms.
patricia
wald
no,
we
are
going
to
permit
him
to
do
something
with
it
if
he
wants
to.
ms.
patricia
wald
if
he
wants
to
board
it
up
and
that
does
not,
in
some
way
infringe
upon
the
historical
preservation
aspect
of
the
property,
then
he
could
do
that,
it
is
the
historical
preservation
simply
said,
this
is
a
beautiful
church
to
look
at
from
the
outside
and
we
do
not
care
what
happens,
whether
anybody
goes
in
it
or
anything
else.
then,
he
can
just
leave
it
stand
there,
if
he
wants
to.
on
the
other
hand,
he
wants
to
continue
to
run
it
as
a
church,
then
he
could
do
that
too.
ms.
patricia
wald
well,
the
church
might
be
the
wrong
example,
but
in
essence
the
owner
continues
with
all
of
both
the
liabilities
and
the
profits
of
ownership.
but,
any
owner
has
certain
options
about
how
to
use
his
property.
ms.
patricia
wald
if
you
boarded
it
up
by
your
own
choice
then
you
--
ms.
patricia
wald
in
most
of
these
cases,
the
sale
and
indeed
in
the
case
instance
here
in
the
new
york
law
they
do
not
forbid
the
sale
per
se,
they
only
forbid
the
sale
for
a
use
which
is
restricted.
so
indeed
many
of
the
cases
in
which
the
courts
have
held
there
is
no
taking
at
a
reasonable
regulatory
use,
they
point
out
that
it
leaves
the
option
with
the
owner
as
to
whether
or
not
he
wants
to
sale
or
lease
it
or
use
it
for
other
purposes.
all
of
these
cases
if
i
may
finish
in
one
sentence,
all
of
the
land
use
cases
have
pointed
out
that
it
is
almost
inevitable
starting
with
justice
holmes
back
in
the
coal
case
that
when
the
government
pursues
a
police
power
for
a
legitimate
end,
it
will
likely
end
up
with
the
diminution
of
value
of
land
and
the
restriction
of
use.
unless
that
becomes
so
onerous
as
to
move
over
into
a
taking
and
where
that
line
is
drawn
the
courts
have
over
the
years
said,
it
is
very
difficult
that
it
is
a
reasonable
use
of
the
police
power.
i
think
the
rule
which
appellant
would
suggest
that
any
time
there
is
a
loss
in
value
of
property
due
to
a
reasonably
valid
regulation
use
of
the
police
power
that
the
owner
must
be
compensated
is
indeed
a
radical
revolutionary
rule,
which
just
simply
has
no
foundation
in
the
past
cases
of
the
police
power
or
indeed
in
the
taking
cases
themselves.
thank
you.
