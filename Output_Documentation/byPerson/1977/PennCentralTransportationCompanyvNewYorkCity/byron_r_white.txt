mr.
gribbon,
what
city
are
you
referring
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
not
say
that
if
it
were
sold
for
$10
or
whatever
the
buyer
would
pay
then
he
just
close
down
the
church.
you
could
not
make
him
operate
the
church.
you
would
not
suggest
that,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
city
here
indicated
that
if
they
seized
operating
as
a
church,
it
would
no
longer
be
appropriate
to
restrict
the
use.
justice
byron
r.
white
without
compensation.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
the
grand
central
case,
are
you
differing
with
your
colleague
that
if
penn
central
just
shut
the
terminal
down,
that
it
would
still
be
required
to
leave
the
building
as
it
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
cease
operating,
then
they
go
in
before
the
commission
and
say,
“we
are
not
making
a
nickel
on
this
unless
we
can
do
something
with
it,
we
cannot
even
pay
our
taxes
on
it,
reduced
as
they
are.”
i
thought
your
colleague
indicated
that
then
they
could
tear
it
down
or
at
least
if
they
were
going
to
have
to
live
it
standing,
they
had
to
be
paid
for
it.
