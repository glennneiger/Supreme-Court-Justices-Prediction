when
you
say
greatest,
are
you
referring
by
population?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
weather?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
doubt
about
how
this
case
would
have
come
out
before
the
enactment
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
would
you
have
relied
on
before
the
enactment
of
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
berman
v.
baltimore
said
the
fifth
amendment
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
today’s
legal
climate,
you
do
not
have
to
be
that
vague
as
in
the
case
from
this
court
held
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
incorporate
the
fifth
amendment
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
not
part
of
the
reasoning
for
the
generalized
use
of
the
height
regulation
the
notion
that
all
of
the
buildings
that
are
subject
to
that
height
regulation
also
derive
some
benefit
from
it
in
that
their
competitor,
so
to
speak,
cannot
build
above
them
and
each
of
them
will
have
a
good
view
from
the
top
floor
and
that
sort
of
thing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
court
of
appeals
really
is
a
statement
of
henry
george’s
single
text,
is
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
five
boroughs
got
together
and
said
together
that
there
just
is
not
much
open
space
in
the
five
boroughs
and
so
we
are
going
to
preserve
all
the
open
space
just
as
it
is,
even
though
it
may
be
in
private
ownership.
do
you
think
that
that
will
be
constitutional?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
finding
that
there
is
a
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
suppose
that
he
was
allowed
to
use
it
as
open
space,
he
could
graze
cattle
there
or
have
dairtrucks.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
reasonable
rate
of
return,
you
sound
like
it
is
a
public
utility.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
in
that
proceeding
the
court
decides
that
the
commission
was
absolutely
right,
no
one
can
dispute
this
is
a
historical
landmark?
is
that
the
end
of
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
standard
do
they
use?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
mean
that
not
of
all
economic
use
but
some
profitable?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
they
set
a
percentage
of
return
on
initial
investment
like
the
public
utility?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
again
is
the
definition
of
being
economically
viable?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
like
public
utilities.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
that
the
new
york
central
railroad
is
applying
to
the
railroad
rate
commission
in
new
york
for
an
intrastate
fare
change
and
the
commission
decides
that
you
can
make
6%
on
--
which
we
consider
a
reasonable
rate
without
a
spur
track
of
three
miles
which
you
presently
own.
so
we
are
just
going
to
take
that
three
miles
spur
track
away
from
you
and
you
will
still
make
6%
on
the
total
investment
you
have.
do
you
think
it
could
do
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
they
want
the
spur
track
is
a
railroad
museum
to
show
how
the
20th
century
used
to
look?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
point
is,
in
the
event
hypothesized
by
my
brother
white,
would
the
constitution
then
require
that
compensation
to
be
paid?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
in
passing
this
ordinance,
was
it
an
ordinance?
what
was
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
they
had
done
their
homework
before
they
have
passed
the
ordinance
and
said
the
following
landmarks
are
hereby
designated
right
in
the
ordinance,
and
they
did
30
of
them
or
40.
so
that
you
were
not
singled
out
at
all.
they
thought
they
had
spotted
all
the
landmarks
in
town.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
you
would
not
be
singled
out.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
at
least
you
would
be
one
of
30.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
agree
that
we
judge
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
the
station
is
a
sustainable
economic
operation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
know,
but
you
disprove
it
or
--?
i
thought
there
were
two
findings
that
it
was
--
as
they
say
economically
viable?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
let
us
assume
for
the
moment
that
we
accept
it.
that
it
is
economically
viable,
but
nevertheless,
it
is
perfectly
obvious,
you
could
make
more
if
you
build
a
big
building
on
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
you
have
a
regulation
put
down
by
osia
that
puts
down
a
number
of
safety
standards
and
the
owner
says,
“i
simply
cannot
run
the
business
with
all
these
safety
standards.”
does
that
mean
that
he
has
a
claim
of
taking
or
is
that
simply
a
question
of
a
regulation
that
forces
an
individual
out
of
business
like
brandie
has
descended,
it
may
have?
