mr.
chief
justice,
justices
of
the
court.
perhaps
i
should
be
intimidated
legally
if
not
physically
by
the
sheer
number
of
governments
and
organizations
on
the
other
side
of
the
question
presented
on
this
appeal
that
have
come
to
the
support
of
the
appellee,
the
greatest
city
in
the
world,
three
other
major
cities,
the
nation’s
two
largest
states.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
i
would
prefer
to
encompass
all
aspects,
mr.
justice

in
addition,
20
civic
organizations
which
are
all
highly
respected,
and
finally,
the
united
states
has
had
sufficient
interest
not
only
to
file
a
brief
but
to
participate
in
argument.
but
i
am
not
so
intimidated
because
the
position
that
i
put
to
you
here
on
behalf
of
penn
central
rests
on
the
bill
of
rights,
that
great
charter
of
liberties,
which
serves
as
a
protection
against
all
government,
not
just
bean-old
government
but
even
the
best-intentioned
government.
in
addition,
i
would
suggest
that
the
unusual
display
of
public
interest
here
serves
to
emphasize
a
principal
element
in
penn
central’s
case.
that
is
the
enormous
public
benefit
which
is
claimed
will
be
brought
about
by
the
governmental
action
that
we
challenge.
as
a
result
of
actions
taken
by
the
new
york
city
landmarks
preservation
commission
pursuant
to
the
city’s
landmarks
law,
penn
central
has
been
prohibited
from
constructing
an
office
building
over
the
grand
central
terminal.
now
that
prohibition
has
been
imposed
by
the
city,
not
because
such
a
building
would
be
unsafe
or
uneconomic
or
in
violation
of
zoning
regulations,
but
solely
to
assure
that
all
who
live
in
new
york
and
all
who
visit
new
york
will
have
an
unimpeded
view,
an
unrestricted
enjoyment
of
the
terminal,
a
structure
which
the
commission
found
to
be
a
magnificent
example
of
french
beaux
arts
architecture.
after
the
terminal
had
been
designated
as
a
landmark
by
a
commission
of
11
private
citizens
reporting
generally
to
the
board
of
estimate,
three
separate
efforts
were
made
under
the
guidance
of
internationally
known
architect,
marcel
breuer
to
persuade
the
commission
in
accordance
with
its
procedures
that
an
office
building
could
be
constructed
without
impairing
the
integrity
of
the
terminal.
all
three
were
rejected
and
it
is
now
common
ground
among
the
parties
that
penn
central
stands
affectively
precluded
from
constructing
a
building
over
the
terminal.
the
record
discloses
that
in
return
for
the
use
of
the
air
rights
over
the
terminal,
penn
central
would
receive
from
a
developer
who
would
bear
all
the
risks
of
constructing
the
building,
$1
million
a
year
during
construction
and
thereafter,
a
minimum
of
$3
million
a
year
escalating
as
rental
collections
increase.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
there
is,
your
honor.
record
2001,
it
is
in
volume
4.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
not
in
the
appendix,
no,
your
honor.
it
is
in
the
record,
came
up
from
the
lower
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
which
is
large
to
understand.
i
say,
therefore,
that
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
city’s
action
has
deprived
penn
central
of
something
of
value.
while
the
city
recognizes
that
penn
central
has
been
denied
the
right
to
construct
an
office
building
which
it
is
entitled
to
do,
otherwise
under
applicable
zoning
regulations
the
city
refuses
to
acknowledge
that
air
rights
constitute
a
form
of
property.
it
even
suggests
that
the
use
of
the
term
is
something
of
a
semantic
trick.
such
rights,
however,
have
been
widely
used,
sold,
utilized
for
50
years
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
hesitate
to
describe
the
controversy
as
one
involving
air
rights
to
the
terminal.
now,
i
do
not
urge
that
the
decision
here
should
turn
on
whether
penn
central’s
laws
are
characterized
as
a
property
right
or
as
a
use.
as
the
solicitor
general
correctly
puts
it,
it
is
the
substance
of
the
government
action
that
controls
rather
than
the
labels
that
are
attached
to
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
no,
your
honor,
the
issue
raised
here
is
not,
as
some
of
the
brief
seem
to
suggest,
whether
the
city
of
new
york
may
validly
preclude
penn
central
from
constructing
a
building.
25
years
ago
in
berman
v.
parker,
this
court,
in
unanimous
opinion
proclaimed
for
all
that
it
is
just
as
appropriate
for
government
action
to
look
to
things
that
beautify
and
enhance
the
quality
of
life
as
it
is
to
do
away
with
things
that
are
unsanitary.
but,
the
issue
here
simply
stated
is
who
is
going
to
bear
the
loss
of
the
burden
that
is
occasioned
by
this
substantial
public
benefit?
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
i
would
think
the
same
considerations
are
present
now,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
i
would
think
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
well,
there
might
have
to
be
a
little
rewriting
of
some
of
the
decisions
there.
but
i
am
looking
at
what
the
fifth
amendment
has
been
held
to
do
since
then.
i
would
have
thought
that
the
fifth
amendment
would
provide
assurance
here
if
it
were
to
come
up
today
without
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it
is
very
difficult
to
imagine
those
circumstances
in
today’s
legal
climate.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
yes,
your
honor.
and
i
say,
i
have
not
dealt
with
that
and
would
not
propose
to
do
it
on
their
basis.
now,
i
would
propose
to
address
the
issue
that
i
have
stated
here
first
by
examining
the
central
premise
of
the
different
justifications
that
have
been
advanced,
first,
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
second
by
the
city
and
its
friends
for
imposing
the
full
cost
on
penn
central
and
that
premise
is
that
where
the
government
acts
in
a
regulatory
capacity
rather
than
through
the
exercise
of
eminent
domain,
there
is
no
need
to
inquire
whether
there
has
been
a
compensable
taking.
i
shall
next
show
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
interpreting
the
taking
clause,
the
fifth
amendment
particularly
those
emphasizing
its
high
content
of
fairness
support
the
conclusion
that
the
provoked
prohibitions
imposed
here
do
constitute
a
taking
for
which
compensation
is
constitutionally
required.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
of
not
being
able
to
build
an
office
building,
the
loss
that
is
suffered
by
being
prevented
from
developing
an
office
building
over
the
terminal.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
true.
the
height
limitation
case,
i
do
not
believe
have
application
here
because
this
is
very
--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
no,
your
honor.
it
is
there.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
right
next
to
it.
because
it
is
selective,
your
honor.
it
does
not
say
--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
no,
i
think
under
the
zoning
case
--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
i
think
the
decisions
indicate
that
zoning
which
is
comprehensive
and
applies
substantially
equally
to
all
people
affected
within
the
area
can
be
tolerated
as
a
non-compensable
taking
on
the
ground
that
the
benefits
and
the
burdens
are
reasonably
dispersed,
not
precisely.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
that
is
right.
but
i
think
the
fact
that
other
people
are
similarly
burdened,
and
presumably
similarly
benefited
by
the
height
limitation,
has
served
to
justify
the
zoning
cases
and
i
do
not
think
it
can
serve
here
to
justify
this
selective
highly
particularized
take.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
i
think
in
many
instances
there
is
just
as
much
of
a
taking
on
the
property
owner
when
something
is
done
by
regulation
as
by
eminent
domain.
but
in
the
regulation
cases
where
you
are
removing
offensive
uses
or
where
in
the
zoning
cases
you
are
acting
broadly
to
take
care
of
the
entire
community
in
distributing
the
burdens
and
the
benefits,
it
has
been
held
not
to
be
a
taking.
in
terms
of
english
language,
yes,
but
in
terms
of
the
constitution,
i
think
it
is
just
that
difference.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
that
is
right,
selective.
it
is
a
height
limitation
for
one
building.
all
of
its
neighbors,
including
pan-am
and
all
the
others,
can
go
much,
much
higher.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
all
i
can
say
is
that
the
zoning
cases
have
viewed
it
as
being
a
permissible
use
of
the
regulatory
power
when
it
is
done
in
a
way
--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
that
is
right,
i
do
not
know
that
it
is
not
rational
to
say
when
all
people
within
the
area
are
similarly
treated,
nobody
can
have
a
residence
or
nobody
can
have
industry.
that
is
a
permissible
use
of
the
government
power.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
yes,
i
think
that
is
right.
but
that
depends
on
whether
it
is
wrong
to
start
with.
the
constitution
does
not
prevent
the
government
from
effecting
necessary
regulations
and
every
action
of
government
has
to
have
some
kind
of
an
adverse
affect
on
somebody.
the
question
is
where
the
line
is
going
to
be
drawn
on
that
adverse
affect?
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
well,
your
honor,
we
do
not
argue
any
equal
protection.
i
think
it
is
a
solid
case
for
a
taking.
the
equal
protection
cases
do
not
give
a
great
deal
of
comfort.
if
perhaps
is
warranted
for
the
government
to
pick
out
a
historic
site
and
say
“this
should
be
preserved.”
we
do
not
think
it
has
to
pick
out
every
site
and
you
cannot
argue
as
to
which
site
is
historic.
i
think
it
is
sufficient
that
we
simply
argue
that
when
they
do
that,
they
pay
for
what
they
take
for
the
public
benefit.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
of
everybody.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
everybody
should
pay
for
it.
and
there
is
no
balancing
of
benefits
and
burdens
as
there
is
in
the
zoning
cases
whereas
mr.
justice
and
i
have
just
been
discussing,
the
court
has
held
that
they
are
not
within
the
taking
provision.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
precisely,
your
honor.
there
is
a
fair
distribution
not
only
of
cost,
but
of
burdens.
therefore,
there
is
no
taking.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
yes,
which
is
not
true
here.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
we
are
solely
burdened
and
unbenefited,
everybody
else,
not
just
the
buildings,
but
the
visitors,
and
the
people
who
do
it
are
the
ones
that
get
the
whole
benefit
out
of
it.
now
the
first
point
i
wanted
to
make
is
that,
however
the
government
acts,
whether
by
eminent
domain
or
purporting
to
act
by
government
regulation,
there
must
be
an
inquiry
into
whether
there
is
a
compensable
taking.
now
the
court
of
appeals
brushed
that
over.
they
simply
recited,
this
is
government
regulation
and
therefore,
there
need
be
no
kind
of
an
inquiry
into
taking.
those
who
support
the
court’s
action
take
the
same
view
that
automatically,
once
you
can
say
this
is
regulatory
action
then
there
is
no
reason
or
there
is
no
occasion
to
look
to
see
whether
there
is
compensation.
now
that
is
the
premise
that
underlies
both
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
and
also
the
position
submitted
by
the
city
here,
and
i
think
it
is
not
supported
by
the
fifth
amendment
itself
or
by
the
cases.
the
fifth
amendment
does
not
by
its
terms
apply
only
to
cases
of
eminent
domain,
it
applies
broadly.
cases
in
these
courts
have
held
that
whatever
governmental
power
is
exercised,
police
power,
commerce
power,
if
there
is
a
taking
you
look
to
see
whether
the
fifth
amendment
comes
into
play.
i
suppose
berman
v.
parker,
which
i
mentioned
earlier
stands
for
the
proposition
that
the
right
of
government
to
bring
about
change
is
designed,
as
they
put
it,
to
enhance
the
quality
of
life.
all
comes
within
the
police
power,
whether
it
is
done
under
eminent
domain
or
whether
it
is
done
through
the
exercise
of
regulatory
actions.
in
most
of
the
cases
where
there
is
a
problem
as
to
a
taking,
there
has
not
been
an
exercise
of
eminent
domain,
it
is
government
regulation
which
is
operated
in
a
way
which
may
constitute
a
taking
even
though
the
exercise
of
eminent
domain
has
not
been
tried.
it
is
claimed
here
that
the
goldblatt
decision
of
this
court
establishes
a
different
rule,
a
rule
that
says,
you
do
not
look
in
the
case
of
regulation
to
what
has
been
taken,
you
look
rather
to
what
is
leftover.
now
that
decision
does
contain
some
language
with
respect
to
the
uses
left
to
the
property
owner
but
i
do
not
believe
it
establishes
anything
like
proposition
claimed
here.
the
challenged
regulation
there
prevented
the
sand
and
gravel
company
from
continuing
its
operations
on
property
that
was
originally
rural
but
had
become
surrounded
by
the
city
of
hempstead.
now
far
from
saying,
as
it
is
urged
here,
that
valid
regulatory
action
cannot
resolve
in
a
compensable
taking,
the
court,
taking
through
mr.
justice
clark
acknowledged
at
the
outset
the
basic
principle
on
which
we
rest
our
case
saying,
“governmental
action
in
the
form
of
regulation
can
be
so
owners
as
to
constitute
a
taking
which
constitutionally
requires
compensation.”
it
then
found
that
there
had
been
no
diminution
in
the
value
of
the
property
involved.
then
therefore,
there
was
not
any
taking.
it
went
on
to
find,
despite
the
owner’s
claim
that
sand
and
gravel
operations
were
utterly
benign
and
unlike
the
other
things
that
had
been
barred
by
the
exercise
of
the
government
regulation,
the
court
overruled
them
and
set
on
safety
grounds,
this
would
be
upheld
as
a
valid
exercise
of
the
police
power.
but,
it
did
not
say
that
as
a
substitute
for
a
finding
that
a
taking
had
not
taken
place.
i
submit,
that
that
is
the
initial
inquiry,
whether
a
taking
has
taken
place.
that
is
the
inquiry
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
make
in
which
those
supporting
the
city
would
not
make.
those
words
that
constitutional
guarantee
that
property
shall
not
be
taken
without
compensation
incorporate,
an
exceedingly
complex
constitutional
concept.
though
it
has
been
with
us
since
the
beginning
of
the
republic,
nothing
approaching
an
all-purpose
principle
has
been
articulated
from
which
one
can
discern
the
specific
application
of
the
concept.
this
court
has
time
and
again
turned
down
the
opportunity
to
annunciate
any
such
principle.
a
scholar
in
the
area
recently
wrote
that
judicial
efforts
to
chart
a
usable
test
for
determining
when
police
power
measures
imposed
constitutionally
compensable
losses
have
on
the
whole
been
notably
unsuccessful.
with
some
exceptions
the
decisional
law
is
largely
characterized
by
confusing
an
incompatible
result
of
an
explained
and
conclusionary
terminology,
circular
reasoning,
and
empty
rhetoric.
now
those
were
the
scholar’s
words,
not
mine.
but
i
hasten
to
say
that
i
have
no
all-purpose
tests
to
offer
the
court
and
i
acknowledge
more
than
the
normal
humility
with
which
one
must
approach
such
constitutional
questions.
i
do
put
you,
however
that
a
review
of
the
taking
cases
does
disclose
two
guidelines
that
may
usefully
be
applied
here
in
determining
whether
the
city’s
action
constitutes
a
compensable
taking.
when
regulatory
action
is
directed
towards
the
elimination
of
offensive
uses
or
condition,
it
has
been
held
in
many
cases
that
the
resulting
loss
to
the
property
owner
is
non-compensable
because
it
is
one
that
he
may
be
properly
called
upon
to
bear
for
the
public
good.
such
cases
began
as
you
all
know
with
the
elimination
of
common
nuisances,
and
then
went
on
to
encompass
other
properties
and
uses
which
though
not
nuisances
were
offensive
to
the
general
tenor
of
the
community
such
as
breweries
and
billiard
halls
and
liberty
stables.
now
the
construction
of
a
multi-story
office
building
in
midtown,
manhattan,
which
penn
central
is
prohibited
from
doing,
is
not
only
permitted
by
the
zoning
laws
but
it
is
actually
encouraged
as
an
efficient
use
of
valuable
land.
i
submit
therefore,
that
the
principle
justification
for
tolerating
some
non-compensable
diminution
in
property
value
was
a
result
of
government
regulation
lends
no
support
to
the
city’s
action
here.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
i
think
if
it
caused
this
loss
and
from
what
you
say
it
would
cause
this
loss
we
would
be
making
the
same
argument.
any
action
that
we
are
forced
to
take
or
kept
from
taking
that
causes
us
a
monetary
loss
is
compensable.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
well,
in
this
particular
case
--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
no,
that
is
not
the
whole
thing.
i
think
it
is
any
governmental
action
of
this
landmark
designation
nature.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
i
would
put
it
because
they
are
taking
a
part
of
our
property,
for
taking
a
part
of
our
property
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
yes,
your
honor
if
there
were
a
cost
--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
i
think
that
is
a
fair
statement,
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
well,
it
is
based
on
the
notion
that
the
reason
they
are
doing
it
is
to
benefit
the
general
public.
if
we
can
show
any
loss
under
the
taking
cases,
whether
it
is
an
expectancy
of
profit
here
or
whether
it
is
a
demolition,
then
it
should
be
compensable.
when
they
take
3
acres
out
of
100
acres
of
land
they
do
not
look
and
say,
“well,
you
can
do
pretty
well
on
the
other
97
acres.”
they
say,
“they
have
taken
3
acres
and
we
will
give
you
the
value
of
it.”
and
that
i
submit
is
precisely
what
we
are
faced
with
here.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
yes,
over
the
terminal?
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
no,
your
honor.
nothing
that
small
has
been
suggested
simply
because
it
would
be
an
inefficient
utilization
of
land.
there
are
no
other
buildings
really
in
that
area
that
had
been
built
in
recent
days
that
would
build
only
that
muchfloor
space.
that
is
the
problem
in
this
highly-priced
portion
of
the
city
to
get
as
much
floor
space
as
is
consistent
with
other
needs.
so
the
answer
is,
no,
it
has
not
been.
although,
i
must
say,
there
is
not
any
suggestion
in
the
action
taken
by
the
landmarks
commission
that
even
that
would
satisfy.
nothing
is
going
to
satisfy
because
they
want
the
air
to
roam
freely
over
grand
central
station.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
that
20
stories
would
not
do?
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
no,
there
has
not
been
to
my
knowledge,
but,
there
has
been
no
resilience
in
the
landmarks
commission
with
three
efforts
to
do
this
under
guidance
of
noted
people.
the
answer
comes
back,
“no,
no,
no.”
every
indication
that
what
is
wanted
is
the
preservation
of
penn
central
in
its
pristine
state.
but
that
is
the
only
way
that
the
people
of
new
york
and
its
visitors
are
going
to
continue
to
enjoy
this
architectural
monument.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
they
can
condemn
it
or
they
can
regulate
it,
and
we
would
be
entitled
to
compensation.
but
i
think
the
power
of
the
city
is
there,
and
that
is
one
of
the
things
to
be
concerned
about,
that
it
is
there.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
well,
i
do
not
think
there
should
be,
and
i
do
not
perceive
a
difference.
i
would
have
thought
that
would
be
a
taking
20
years
ago.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
i
would
think
that
would
clearly
have
been
a
taking
20
years
ago
as
well
as
today.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
well,
there
is
a
long
history
to
it,
they
bargained
they
were
pioneers
--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
they
did
not
steal
it
fair-and-square,
they
acquired
it
over
a
long
period
of
time,
and
indeed
that
building
there
has
done
a
great
deal
for
the
middle
of
new
york
and
which
came
first
is
pretty
hard
to
say.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
well,
that
is
what
the
city
wants
to
maintain.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
they
acquired
it
over
many
years
from
predecessor
railroads
largely
and
it
is
the
grand
central
terminal
now
that
we
are
talking
about
and
not
penn
central,
that
is
gone.
now
i
submit
that
the
most
frequently
applied
consideration
in
determining
when
government
regulation
has
resulted
in
a
compensable
taking
has
simply
stated
one
of
fairness.
as
this
court
observed
in
the
forest
case,
there
is
a
strong
element
of
ethics
in
the
constitutional
requirement
that
private
property
not
be
taken
without
compensation.
time
and
again,
decisions
of
this
court
have
reiterated
that
the
overwriting
purpose
of
the
fifth
amendment
guarantee
is
to
assure
fairness
in
the
impact
of
government
upon
the
owners
of
private
property.
back
in
1893,
mr.
justice,
breuer
speaking
for
the
court
said,
“the
fifth
amendment
prevents
the
public
from
loading
upon
one
individual
more
than
his
just
share
for
the
burdens
of
government.”
40
years
later
mr.
justice
brandie
speaking
for
the
court,
“particular
individuals
may
not
be
singled
out
to
bear
the
cost
of
advancing
the
public
convenience.”
in
1960,
the
court
said
the
fifth
amendment
is
designed
to
bar
the
government
from
forcing
some
people
alone
to
bear
public
burdens
which
in
all
fairness
and
justice
should
be
borne
by
the
public
as
a
whole.
just
a
few
years
ago
in
a
decision
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
the
essence
of
these
declarations
was
captured
and
the
statement
that
the
fifth
amendment
derives
as
much
content
from
basic
equitable
principles
of
fairness
as
it
does
from
technical
concepts
of
property
law.
now
these
two
taking
guidelines
that
i
have
suggested
would
appear
to
be
opposite
sides
of
the
same
coin.
where
you
are
eliminating
the
use
or
condition
which
is
imposing
a
burden
on
other
people.
it
is
fair
to
permit
the
person
who
is
charging
that
to
take
some
expense,
to
take
some
burden
in
order
to
eliminate
the
burden
that
is
on
the
rest
of
the
people.
on
the
other
hand,
where
the
government
sets
out
to
secure
an
improvement
or
a
benefit
for
all
society
performing
what
has
been
called
its
entrepreneurial
or
its
resource
acquisition
function,
basic
considerations
of
fairness
dictate
that
a
disproportionate
share
of
the
cost
of
securing
that
benefit
not
be
borne
or
loaded
on
a
single
individual.
significantly,
neither
the
court
of
appeals
nor
the
city
and
its
supporting
friends
have
anything
to
say
about
this
fairness
concept
which
has
to
be
the
lifeblood
of
the
fifth
amendment.
nothing
they
could
say
would
alter
the
fact
that
full
burden
of
the
city’s
action
in
freezing
the
terminal
falls
exclusively
on
penn
central.
it
is
being
called
upon
to
bear
a
public
burden
which
in
all
fairness
and
justice
should
be
borne
by
the
public
as
a
whole
in
order
to
obtain
the
full
and
unimpeded
enjoyment
of
the
terminal.
i
turn
now
to
the
justification
that
the
court
of
appeals
found
for
allowing
the
full
cost
of
the
terminal
preservation
to
be
borne
by
penn
central.
it
made
no
inquiry
into
taking
and
simply
looked
to
see
whether
penn
central
had
established
that
it
would
be
impossible,
and
that
is
the
word
of
the
court,
for
it
to
earn
a
reasonable
return
on
the
terminal
without
utilizing
the
air
rights.
it
is
our
contention
of
course
that
whatever
the
remaining
value
of
the
terminal,
we
are
entitled
to
compensation
for
that
part
that
has
been
taken.
but,
even
if
the
remaining
value
of
the
terminal
is
to
be
given
the
critical
significance
that
has
been
accorded
by
the
court,
that
value
was
erroneously
ascertained.
in
applying
what
it
acknowledged
to
be
a
special
rule
for
landmark
statutes,
the
court
divided
the
value
of
property
into
two
separate
ingredients
that
contributed
by
private
efforts
and
that
contributed
by
the
efforts
of
organized
society
as
a
whole.
then,
without
attempting
to
ascertain
how
much
of
the
terminal’s
value
had
been
contributed
by
private
or
society
efforts,
it
concluded
that
penn
central
was
not
entitled
any
compensation
because
it
had
failed
to
establish
that
there
was
no
possibility
that
it
could
not
earn
a
reasonable
return
on
the
remaining
and
also
un-ascertained
privately
contributed
value
of
the
terminal.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
i
believe
that
is
a
fair
statement,
mr.
justice
stewart.
that
is
the
way
i
read
those
briefs.
they
all
back
away
to
some
degree
and
come
forward
with
a
further
explanation
of
why
the
decision
should
go
against
penn
central.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
yeah,
but
i
submit,
it
is
not
a
statement
of
sound
constitutional
law.
as
many
of
henry
james’
things
were
not
necessarily
sound.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
james
would
be
different.
the
court
then
went
on
in
addition
to
these
two
ingredients
of
value
to
impute
a
great
deal
of
income
which
it
did
not
quantify
to
the
terminal
from
other
buildings
in
the
area.
and
then
as
if
to
put
its
position
beyond
all
argument,
the
court
observed
that
the
terminal
maybe
capable
of
producing
a
reasonable
return
for
its
owners
even
if
it
can
never
operate
at
a
profit.
i
submit
that
under
no
circumstances
can
the
court’s
view
of
whether
penn
central
is
able
to
earn
a
reasonable
return
on
this
property
absent,
the
development
rights
be
accepted.
i
think
its
effort
to
divide
property
into
these
two
segments
it
really
has
no
support
in
the
authorities
and
it
is
a
principle
that
cannot
be
limited.
it
cannot
be
limited
to
the
terminal
or
the
landmarks,
it
applies
to
all
properties,
it
applies
to
a
residence,
it
applies
to
a
farm,
to
an
office
building.
they
are
all
valuable
or
not
valuable,
depending
upon
their
location,
depending
upon
social
services
protection
and
amenities.
now
if
this
approach
were
adopted,
the
government
would
be
free
to
appropriate
any
property
by
giving
only
a
pittance
of
what
that
property
is
worth
on
the
open
market.
the
error
in
the
court’s
opinion
is
perhaps
further
disclosed
in
the
passage
near
the
end
where
it
refers
to
the
city’s
financial
distress,
and
then
says
that
in
times
of
easy
affluence,
preservation
of
landmarks
through
eminent
domain
might
be
desirable
or
even
required.
surely,
however,
no
constitutional
guarantee
particularly
one
based
on
the
fifth
amendment
should
be
granted
or
denied
depending
upon
the
government’s
fiscal
condition.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
st.
john's?
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
i
think
it
would,
your
honor.
as
you
put
the
case,
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
a
taking
and
the
church
would
be
entitled
to
compensation
on
the
value
of
that
land
and
building.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
i
do
not
think
it
would.
i
think
whoever
held
the
title
at
that
point
would
be
entitled
to
the
compensation.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
well,
that
is
a
phrase
that
has
been
banded
in
the
cases,
and
i
am
not
too
sure
of
the
meaning.
i
think
they
would
be
willing
to
get
what
that
property
is
worth,
what
the
hilton
hotel
would
pay
for
them.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
if
that
is
permitted
by
the
generally
applicable
zoning
laws,
and
i
take
that
it
would
be
because
there
is
a
hotel
across
the
street.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
whatever
they
are.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
the
same
as
everybody
else
is
limited.
but,
what
an
owner
has
invested
in
a
piece
of
property
is
really
quite
immaterial
to
what
he
gets
when
that
property
is
taken.
he
may
have
an
enormous
investment,
but
he
is
not
going
to
get
it
back
if
the
property
is
not
worth
that
or
he
may
have
a
fully-depreciated
investment
so
it
is
net
zero,
and
it
is
the
value,
it
is
the
loss
to
that
owner.
it
is
not
really
what
is
acquired
or
what
the
investment
law
is,
but
the
loss
to
the
owner
which
is
determinative.
as
we
discussed
earlier
here
in
my
colloquy
with
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
city
and
its
friends
backed
away
from
the
court
of
appeals
rational
and
attempt
to
salvage
this
statute
as
being
simply
a
form
of
land
use
regulation
or
zoning.
in
the
first
place,
there
is
not
any
general
principle
that
all
land
use
regulation
or
all
zoning
is
permissible
and
does
not
constitute
a
taking.
this
court
made
that
clear
in
the
leading
case
of
euclid
against
ambler.
the
basis
on
which
many
zoning
laws
have
been
upheld
is
that
they
represent
a
comprehensive
regulatory
program.
this
court
has
used
the
term
'comprehensive'
in
a
number
of
recent
decisions.
it
has
not
been
defined,
but
i
take
it
that
if
comprehensive
means
anything,
it
means
something
close
to
the
opposite
of
selective
or
highly
particularized.
that
is
the
vice
of
this
landmark
law.
it
is
not
zoning,
it
does
not
purport
to
be
zoning,
it
is
on
top
of
the
zoning
laws.
there
are
vast
pervasive
zoning
laws
in
the
city
of
new
york
and
this
sits
on
top
of
them
superimposed,
and
it
permits
highly-selective
and
particularized
actions.
the
designation
for
example
of
the
public
library
or
of
the
brooklyn
bridge
or
of
the
statue
of
liberty
as
historic
landmarks
does
not
mean
anything.
the
designation
of
a
final
home
as
a
historic
landmark
may
simply
give
the
owner
the
satisfaction
of
putting
a
brass
plaque
on
the
door
to
that
effect.
the
recent
designation
of
the
radio
city
music
hall
interior
as
a
landmark
was
followed
very
quickly
by
efforts
by
the
state
and
the
city
to
put
up
about
$2
million
to
keep
the
show
going
for
another
year.
but
it
is
the
unpredictable
nature
and
the
highly-selective
nature
of
what
not
only
has
been
done
but
indeed
what
the
law
contemplates.
that
is
why
the
court
of
appeals
looked
at
this
as
zoning
and
said,
“no,
sir,
it
cannot
be
zoning.”
this
really
resembles
discriminatory
zoning
which
has
been
condemned
and
it
declined
to
condemn
it
because
it
was
historical.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
i
would
think
it
would
take
place
at
the
former
time.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
i
do
not
think
it
imposes
any
burden
or
a
loss.
indeed
it
is
a
net
gain
for
the
owner.
he
does
not
have
to
do
anything
but
he
is
permitted
to
put
it
on.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
no,
that
depends
upon
what
he
can
later
workout
with
the
landmarks
commission,
whether
he
can
have
additions
to
it,
which
will
not
impair
the
integrity
of
the
house
just
as
penn
central
attempted
to
do
things
that
would
not
impair
the
terminal.
the
mere
designation
is
just
the
start
of
the
gain.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
it
is
not
burdened
the
way
penn
central
has
been
burdened.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
in
a
commercial
zone
where
it
is
precluded
from
doing
what
is
permitted
under
the
zoning
law.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
right.
under
any
zoning
law
the
people
who
are
affected
do
have
to
deal
with
some
restrictions,
but
those
restrictions
are
uniformly
applied
and
the
affected
person
can
move
around,
it
can
develop,
it
can
do
things
within
those
zoning
restrictions.
penn
central
has
no
such
freedom.
the
terminal
has
in
effect
been
selected
out
and
frozen
in
place.
i
submit
that
the
landmarks
law
has
thus
operated
as
a
compensable
taking
of
its
property
rights
to
acquire
compensation.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
if
i
may
briefly,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
shall
like
to
answer
mr.
justice
marshall’s
inquiry
and
make
clear
that
penn
central
did
make
an
effort
with
the
landmarks
commission
to
obtain
a
certificate
of
appropriateness
and
no
exterior
effect.
in
the
landmarks
commission,
there
was
never
any
attention
paid
to
dollars.
that
was
strictly
an
aesthetic
determination.
the
only
time
economic
laws
came
into
the
picture
was
when
the
case
went
into
court.
and
then
instead
of
inquiring
as
to
whether
there
was
a
taking
and
making
a
determination
which
is
not
terribly
complex
in
this
case
as
to
the
value
of
what
was
taken
the
courts
went
off
on
this
economic
inquiry
and
the
reasonable
return
which,
as
you
read
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
we
were
bound
to
lose.
there
was
no
way
to
win
under
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
analyzed
this
economic
problem.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
this
landmarks
law
is
an
ordinance.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
i
think
if
the
economic
impact
on
us
was
the
same,
ultimately
as
it
is
here,
the
fact
that
they
were
designated
in
the
law
rather
than
designated
by
the
commission
would
be
immaterial.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
well,
certainly
were
singled
out
much
more
than
the
zoning
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
yes,
but
we
understand
that
they
do
not
operate
the
same
way.
among
these
30
are
the
statue
of
liberty
and
the
landmarks
law
does
not
operate
on
it.
it
was
nearly
the
impact
that
operates
on
us.
another
one
is
a
tree
in
brooklyn.
it
is
the
way
it
operates
to
take
property
that
we
complain
of
here.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
does
it
operate
here?
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
no,
i
do
not
think
so,
your
honor
because
the
only
--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
i
say
the
court
of
appeals
finding
to
that
effect
is
totally
erroneous
because
it
is
based
on
this
concept
that
we
need
only
earn
or
return
on
the
privately
contributed
ingredient.
that
destroys
the
entire
finding.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
i
still
say,
even
if
you
accept
it,
the
decision
is
wrong
and
we
are
entitled
to
compensation.
i
do
not
think
the
fact
that
what
we
have
left
over
is
atonement
for
what
has
been
taken
from
us.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
i
think
it
is.
i
think
that
is
a
very
important
part
of
our
argument.
i
think
that
this
highest
and
best
use
is
something
that
has
to
be
looked
at
very
carefully
and
i
would
ask
the
court
to
look
at
the
causby
decision
here
in
328,
which
is
cited,
which
illustrates
a
number
of
things.
in
the
first
place,
property
was
not
taken
by
the
government.
yet,
there
was
a
loss
to
the
property
owner
and
he
was
compensated
for
it.
second,
his
entire
property
was
not
taken.
he
was
compensated
because
he
was
no
longer
able
to
operate
a
chicken
farm
and
it
was
clear
that
he
could
have
operated
a
vegetable
patch.
the
court
noted
that,
but,
the
compensation
was
because
he
was
prevented
from
doing
that.
the
court
also
said
that
an
expected
use
of
a
property
is
properly
to
be
taken
into
account
in
making
an
evaluation
for
taking
purposes.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
that
is
what
it
said,
an
expected
use.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
i
am
not
sure
how
it
is
different.
i
think
it
makes
more
sense
because
an
expected
use
is
clearly
an
element
of
value.
that
is
why
people
buy
it
for
what
they
expect
to
do.
i
think
the
highest
and
beneficial
use
is
a
term
that
has
really
outlived
its
usefulness,
if
it
ever
had
one
because
i
think
the
cases
stand
for
the
proposition
that
you
get
compensation
for
what
has
been
taken,
whatever
the
value.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
i
would
put
it
under
terms
of
expected
use.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
the
zoning
would
prohibit
it
but
for
a
legitimate
use.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
as
the
solicitor
general
recognizes,
a
statute
such
as
this
landmarks
law
creates
unusual
opportunities
for
arbitrary
action.
the
remedy
is
not
in
judicial
review
at
a
landmark
designation.
those
who
own
property
that
is
coveted
for
public
use
are
rarely,
if
ever,
going
to
be
a
majority
at
the
post
or
in
law-making
bodies.
the
only
effect
of
discipline
on
government
acquisition
of
private
resources
is
that
provided
by
the
pocketbook.
only
if
the
elected
representatives
and
their
designees
are
required
to
make
a
cost-benefit
analysis
and
pay
through
the
taxes
what
they
are
going
to
acquire
from
private
people
for
public
use.
is
there
any
protection
for
private
property
against
ever
expanding
government
acquisition
of
private
resources?
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
it
may
be
if
the
representatives
have
decided
that
those
osia
requirements
are
necessary
to
do
away
with
harm
that
may
be
a
price
that
the
individual
owner
has
to
pay.
but
i
suggest
the
difference
between
that
when
the
government
goes
out
in
a
resource
acquisition
capacity
as
it
is
doing
here,
as
it
did
in
the
case
of
the
gettysburg
battlefield
many
years
ago
and
where
the
government
did
pay
eminent
domain
for
it.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
above,
yes.
that
is
right,
your
honor,
it
was
the
interference
with
the
use.
as
they
said,
they
could
take
into
account
an
expected
use
and
that
is
precisely
what
we
are
doing
here,
a
recognizable
expected
use
of
a
small
building
in
the
middle
of
manhattan.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
well,
yes,
but
i
do
not
know
that
that
would
distinguish
it.
this
is
a
recognized
property
use.
you
should
have
to
begin
from
the
bottom
and
go
up.
