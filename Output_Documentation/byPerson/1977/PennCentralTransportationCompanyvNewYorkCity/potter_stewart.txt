justice
potter
stewart
is
there
a
record
anywhere,
a
picture
or
a
drawing,
an
architect's
drawing
or
a
sketch
of
what
this
building
would
look
like?
justice
potter
stewart
not
in
the
appendix?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
talking
about
the
full
cost?
the
full
cost
of
what?
justice
potter
stewart
now
it
has
been
held
in
a
case,
hudson,
i
think
it
was,
that
a
municipality
could
limit
the
height
of
all
buildings
within
its
borders.
justice
potter
stewart
why
isn't
that
a
taking?
justice
potter
stewart
the
taking
is
just
the
same,
selective
or
non-selective,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
it
might
be
discrimination,
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
taking
it
is
just
exactly
the
same
if
you
limit
every
building
in
the
municipality
to
no
more
than
4-15
stories.
justice
potter
stewart
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
property
owner,
the
taking
is
precisely
the
same,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
i
can
understand
your
argument
based
upon
discrimination
of
some
kind.
but
if
it
has
been
established
as,
i
think
you
can
see
it
has,
that
a
municipal
government
can
limit
the
height
of
every
building
within
its
borders,
why
is
it
not
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
property
owner
just
as
much
of
taking
in
that
case
as
it
is
in
your
case?
justice
potter
stewart
i
fully
understand.
i
just
still
have
difficulty
understanding
that
why
it
is
not
as
much
a
taking
in
one
case
as
in
the
other,
and
quite
apart
from
any
argument
based
upon
discrimination
or
irrationality
or
anything
else.
justice
potter
stewart
you
do
not
try
to
justify
it
rationally,
you
just
say
that
that's
authority,
not
reason.
justice
potter
stewart
when
several
wrongs
do
not
make
it
right,
they
make
just
several
wrongs,
do
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
as
my
brother
rehnquist
implies
in
his
question,
the
theory
is
i
think
that
benefits
are
accorded
to
everybody
in
terms
of
light
and
air
and
so
on.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
here
if
all
you
wanted
to
do
was
to
replace
the
building
with
one
of
the
same
height?
is
it
just
that
the
building
was
inefficient
and
you
just
want
to
build
a
building,
but
you
are
quite
willing
to
not
go
up
with
it
at
the
same
height
and
the
city
said,
“no,
we
want
you
to
keep
the
old
building?”
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
just
not
that
some
air
space
is
being
taken.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
know,
but
that
is
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
so
this
would
be
a
taking
because
the
city
would
be
keeping
you
from
making
more
profit
than
you
could
by
using
the
same
size
building.
justice
potter
stewart
you
would
make
the
argument
even
if
it
were
conceded
which
i
am
sure
it
is
not,
even
if
it
were
conceded
that
the
old
building
was
profitable
in
the
sense
that
you
were
not
losing
any
money
on
it.
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
could
double
what
the
county
would
show
you
could
make
by
using
the
building,
you
would
say
they
are
taking
part
of
your
property.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
your
fundamental
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
read
over
the
briefs
filed
by
your
brothers
and
sisters
on
the
other
side,
it
is
my
impression
that
none
of
them
really
tried
to
defend
the
basic
reasoning
of
the
--
that
part
of
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals,
would
you
agree
with
that?
justice
potter
stewart
very
close.
justice
potter
stewart
henry
george.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
gribbon,
may
i
interrupt
with
a
question
that
when
does
the
taking
take
place?
supposing
with
respect
of
the
chief
justice's
example
of
the
church
which
say
it
had
no
negotiations
with
hilton,
but
the
congress
decided
that
they
would
designate
as
a
historic
landmark
today.
they
had
no
deal
on
the
fire
or
anything
like
that.
would
there
be
a
taking
then
or
would
it
only
a
take
place
when
they
could
show
they
had
a
better
offer?
justice
potter
stewart
then
why
do
you
say
the
putting
a
plaque
on
the
door
of
a
home
is
just
a
ceremonial
act?
why
would
that
not
also
be
a
taking?
justice
potter
stewart
is
he
not
equally
forbidden
to
tear
down
the
house
and
sell
it
for
something
else?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
i
do
not
think
so.
i
think
counsel
very
clearly
conceded
the
complete
validity
of
all
the
zoning
legislation
in
new
york
city
at
least
for
the
purposes
of
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
suppose,
in
my
brother
rehnquist’s
example,
he
was
permitted
to
put
a
fence
around
it
and
if
people
want
to
come
and
sit
in
the
sunshine,
they
could
pay
a
little
fee
and
they
would
be
raised
enough
to
pay
his
taxes
and
maybe
1%
profit.
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
not
be
enough
for
the
land
owner
to
say,
“i
may
be
able
to
make
a
profit
here
the
way
it
is,
but
i
can
make
two
or
three
times
as
much
if
you
permitted
another
use?”
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
as
the
case
comes
to
us,
we
must
judge
it
on
the
basis
that
the
grand
central’s
present
use
is
profitable?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
koerner.
justice
potter
stewart
grand
central
is
still
used
by
the
railroads
for
passenger
service.
justice
potter
stewart
let
us
assume
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
allowed
the
station
to
be
clothed
for
rail
service
on
the
ground
but
not
enough
people
used
it
for
that
purpose.
assume
further
that
no
other
use
of
the
building
in
its
present
condition
is
deemed
feasible.
justice
potter
stewart
what
would
your
position
be
with
respect
to
that
situation?
justice
potter
stewart
was
that
clear
from
the
new
york
law?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
a
specific
section
of
the
new
york
law
that
deals
with
that
situation?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
is
not
in
the
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
it
is?
justice
potter
stewart
in
any
event
similar
to
the
question
of
my
brother
powell,
if
the
company
at
any
time
in
the
future,
next
year
or
the
year
after
that,
any
time
it
can
prove
that
the
situation
has
changed
and
that
the
property
is
no
longer
economically
viable,
it
will
get
relief.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
koerner,
could
i
return
for
a
moment
to
justice
powell’s
question
about
economic
viability
of
demolition
or
something
like
that.
as
i
understood
the
statute,
the
statutory
test
of
whether
to
grant
a
certificate
of
appropriateness
does
not
say
anything
at
all
about
economic
viability.
am
i
wrong
on
that?
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
ground
of
economic
--?
justice
potter
stewart
what
section
of
the
statute
authorizes
that,
207-6.0?
i
do
not
see
anything
in
there
about
economic
viability.
justice
potter
stewart
alright,
but
you
do
agree
that
with
respect
to
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
8.0,
i
see.
but
with
respect
to
the
grand
central,
economics
are
totally
irrelevant.
justice
potter
stewart
but
not
under
subsection
6?
justice
potter
stewart
under
the
constitution.
now
as
you
are
admitting
that
as
applied
in
that
situation
the
statute
would
be
unconstitutional.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
landmark
law
in
it
as
it
reads
is
unconstitutional
if
it
does
not
allow
for
some
kind
of
remedy
when
there
is
this
kind
of
economic
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
koerner,
before
you
do
that,
let
me
just
understand
your
theory.
if
there
is
no
taking
here,
you
do
not
even
have
to
give
them
the
tdr.
justice
potter
stewart
then
why
do
we
have
to
consider?
justice
potter
stewart
but
maybe
you
have
been
generous
than
the
constitution
compels
you
to
be.
why
is
that
of
any
relevance
at
all,
what
we
have
to
decide?
justice
potter
stewart
nobody
is
defending
his
rationale.
justice
potter
stewart
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
you
have
been
fair?
i
do
not
understand.
justice
potter
stewart
but
your
legal
position
is
you
do
not
have
to
be
fair.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
koerner,
let
me
just
ask
one
more
question.
i
know
you
are
concerned
about
your
time,
but
if
the
transfer
rights
are
of
equal
value
or
substantially
equal
value,
could
we
not
hold
that
there
was
a
taking
and
then
on
retrial
they
would
find
that
there
was
just
compensation,
you
can
go
ahead
with
your
program
without
any
--?
justice
potter
stewart
you
concede
they
were
not.
justice
potter
stewart
for
purposes
of
our
decision,
we
should
assume
they
are
not.
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
causby
case,
the
air
space
above
a
minimum
safe
altitude
was
not
deemed
compensable,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
impact
on
the
use
of
the
land
below
on
the
surface.
