pan-am
building
is
not
the
shortest
building.
justice

it
is
right
next
to
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
gribbon,
not
to
long
this
case,
how
did
penn
central
or
grand
central,
how
did
they
get
that
piece
of
land
right
in
the
middle
of
park
avenue?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
they
steal
it
fair-and-square?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
sure
does,
when
you
are
driving,
you
have
to
go
all
the
way
around
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
see!
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
then
you
are
assuming
with
the
house
that
it
is
in
a
single
family
occupancy
zone.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
it
can
never
be
anything
more
than
basically
what
it
is.
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
is
in
a
commercial
zone.
justice
thurgood
marshall
by
all
others
in
the
commercial
zone.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
the
landmark
commission
qualified
to
deal
with
due
process?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
not
giving
it
business?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
say
it
is
not
a
zoning
commission.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
a
minute
ago,
you
said,
“oh,
no”.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
were
not
going
to
get
in
the
zoning
business.
i
thought
that
is
what
you
said.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
now
you
are
going
in
zoning?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
assume
that
commission
knows
how
to
operate
a
railroad
terminal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
who
makes
that
determination?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
talking
about
with
the
commission
by
itself,
do
they
make
that
determination?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
understood
two
or
three
times
penn
center
went
there
trying
to
work
this
out.
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
did
not
go
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
landmark
commission
can
do
this
at
any
time,
it
sees
fit.
justice
thurgood
marshall
time-wise
they
could
do
it
on
a
building
that
was
80-years-old.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
assume
that
is
true
as
to
all
state
commissions.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
there
is
nothing
new,
it
is
old
but
especially
for
this
commission.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
we
had
an
offer
to
sell
it
to
the
supermarket,
a
landmark
supermarket,
would
that
be
right?
the
grand
central
supermarket.
would
that
be
a
price
he
had
to
be
paid?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
just
want
to
put
one
little
point
to
the
chief
justice’s
question.
now,
we
have
got
the
cattle
and
all
that.
the
grand
central
supermarket
has
(inaudible)
build
a
huge
land
mall
there
and
they
will
give
him
$2,500
an
acre.
is
that
the
price?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
without
compensation.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
highest
and
best
use
might
be
to
sell
it
as
a
slaughter
house
for
$8,000
that
the
zoning
would
--
