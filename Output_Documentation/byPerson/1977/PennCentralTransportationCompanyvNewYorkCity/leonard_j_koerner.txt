mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
appellant’s
argument
has
proceeded
from
the
approach
that
the
only
method
to
regulate
private
property
is
by
and
through
the
principles
of
eminent
domain.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
well,
let
me
just
establish
the
perimeter
of
the
appellant’s
argument.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
no.
what
we
contend
is
this
is
another
type
of
land
use
regulation
with
a
very
same
test
annunciated
by
this
court
for
all
other
land
use
cases
for
those
applied
here.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
no,
this
is
the
nub
of
the
case.
the
appellant
has
proceeded
with
the
assumption
that
grand
central
terminal
has
been
singled
out.
that
analysis
might
be
correct
if
they
had
never
been
a
landmarks
preservation
law
and
in
response
to
an
announcement
by
penn
central
that
they
were
going
to
build
a
building
on
top
of
grand
central
terminal
that
the
public
reacted
to
it
and
passed
a
law
that
distinctively
impacted
on
penn
central.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
that
is
correct.
that
is
not
what
is
before
the
court.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
in
this
particular
case,
we
have
a
comprehensive
land
use
plan
which
sets
out
in
advance
the
criteria
for
determining
whether
or
not
a
building
is
architecturally
or
historically
significant.
the
intention
of
the
plan
is
to
preserve
all
historical
buildings,
whether
by
accident
they
are
a
part
of
historic
district
or
they
are
single
and
outside
the
district.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
it
would
depend
on
the
strength.
you
are
saying
without
any
--?
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
the
answer
would
be,
no,
because
the
individual
who
was
affected
by
the
regulation
would
not
be
getting
any
return
on
his
property,
nor
would
he
be
permitted
to
use
his
property
for
any
purpose.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
no,
because
that
would
not
be
economically
productive.
we
do
not
contend
that
if
the
appellant
in
this
case
had
been
able
to
establish
that
his
property
as
restricted
was
not
economically
viable
that
he
would
not
be
entitled
to
relief,
he
would
be.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
no,
that
would
be
insufficient.
the
test
is
whether
or
not
the
property
as
restricted,
it
is
economically
viable.
it
is
the
same
test
that
has
been
applied
by
this
court
in
other
land
use
regulations.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
that
is
correct.
but
the
test
is
not
whether
or
not
he
can
receive
the
highest
and
best
use.
there
has
been
no
taking
in
this
case.
the
appellant
has
not
had
any
out-of-pocket
expense
incurred.
what
he
has
lost
is
the
potential
to
develop
his
property
of
the
highest
and
best
use.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
yes,
but
it
must
be
balanced
against
the
validity
of
the
land
use
regulation.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
of
the
entire
community
of
which
the
appellant
is
a
part.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
entire
community
should
pay
the
appellant
if
the
restriction
denies
him
the
right
to
a
reasonable
rate
of
return.
the
problem
here
is
that
everybody
is
trying
to
analogize
this
case
to
zoning.
but
it
is
a
different
type
of
land
use
regulation.
the
promotion
of
which
has
the
same
effect
on
the
community
as
the
zoning,
and
that
is
to
make
the
community
more
attractive.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
no,
we
have
not
quantified
it
except
to
the
extent
that
it
has
been
suggested
that
6%
would
be
reasonable.
but
we
never
got
to
the
point
in
this
litigation
because
there
was
a
total
failure
of
proof.
the
appellant
was
unable
to
show
that
he
could
not
make
a
profit.
that
is
precisely
why
we
had
the
trial
in
the
state
court.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
well,
in
that
case,
the
question
was,
whether
or
not
our
designation
would
interfere
with
the
existing
use?
to
the
extent
that
the
owner
wanted
to
convert
the
private
residence
to
a
commercial
residence
then
he
would
be
entitled
to
show
whether
the
property
was
economically
viable.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
no.
if
the
designation
did
not
interfere
with
the
use
of
the
church
as
a
church,
since
it
is
a
non-profit
association
it
would
be
our
position
that
that
church
could
be
maintained
as
part
as
an
overall
scheme
to
preserve
landmarks.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
if
there
was
a
justification
and
then
they
could
apply
to
the
landmarks
commission
and
that
would
be
a
condition,
that
would
be
considered
by
the
commission.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
yes.
that
is
not
involved
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
no.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
no.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
they
have
set
up
a
procedure
to
determine
which
properties
are
historically
significant.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
it
is
like
the
zoning
commission
to
the
extent
that
its
--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
no,
i
was
not
able
to
finish.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
no,
what
i
said
--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
no.
what
i
am
saying
that
in
both
zoning
and
landmarks,
you
have
expert
commissions
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
developing
a
comprehensive
land
use
scheme.
the
purpose
of
the
scheme
is
to
benefit
the
community.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
with
respect
--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
no,
the
commission
determines
whether
the
railroad
terminal
fits
under
the
criteria
before
it,
that
is,
whether
it
is
architecturally
and
historically
significant.
once
it
is
designated
if
it
imposes
a
hardship,
that
is,
if
it
denies
the
appellant
a
reasonable
rate
of
return
or
makes
the
property
economic.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
the
court
in
this
case
made
that
determination
after
a
lengthy
trial.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
there
is
a
procedure
within
the
--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
no.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
well,
they
had
applied
to
the
commission
for
the
right
to
knock-down
grand
central
terminal
and
put
up
an
office
building.
the
question
was,
whether
or
not
that
application
was
appropriate
for
the
purpose
of
effectuating
the
chapter,
the
statute?
and
the
landmarks
commission
properly
determined
that
it
would
not
be
appropriate.
penn
central
did
not
choose
to
litigate
that
issue
in
a
court
proceeding.
indeed
they
have
not
chosen
to
litigate
the
question
of
whether
grand
central
terminal
is
a
landmark,
it
must
be
assumed.
with
respect
to
the
analogy
to
zoning,
in
zoning,
it
is
reasonable
to
divide
up
area
into
geographical
areas.
that
is
the
reasonableness
of
a
zoning
plan.
but
with
a
landmark
regulation
the
reasonableness
depends
upon
the
preservation
purpose,
and
that
purpose
is
only
achieved
by
preserving
the
landmarks
wherever
they
may
be
in
the
city
of
new
york.
it
is
that
distinction,
it
is
a
different
type
of
land
use
regulation.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
no.
there
are
procedures
set
up
where
they
have
to
have
a
hearing,
they
have
to
make
a
--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
yes,
that
is
correct.
but,
the
built-in
safeguard
is
that
if
the
owner
of
the
subject
property
is
unhappy
with
the
designation,
he
can
bring
a
special
proceeding
in
the
supreme
court
and
challenge
the
designation
on
the
basis
of
arbitrariness
and
capriciousness.
one
of
the
factors
in
considering
whether
there
has
been
a
deprivation
of
due
process.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
that
is
correct.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
well,
that
is
precisely
our
point
that
this
is
a
land
use
regulation
that
has
the
same
effect
as
any
other
land
use
regulation.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
no,
because
all
that
says
is
that
the
designation
is
proper.
whether
or
not
the
designation
makes
the
property
economically
unviable
is
the
type
of
issue
that
was
reviewed
by
all
the
state
courts
and
this
court.
that
is
the
due
process
question.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
whether
or
not
the
property,
as
restricted,
is
being
precluded
of
all
reasonable
beneficial
use.
i
want
to
point
out
that
the
--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
that
is
correct.
but
what
they
do
determine
is
what
this
court
has
constantly
reiterated
that
when
the
police
power
is
properly
exercised,
and
by
the
way
there
was
no
dispute
that
this
is
a
proper
subject
for
the
exercise
to
the
police
power
that
the
highest
and
maximum
use
is
not
a
necessary
goal.
that
it
is
presumed
that
that
goal
can
be
withdrawn
when
you
exercise
the
police
power.
that
is
a
necessary
by-product.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
no,
they
have
not,
they
did
not
do
that
because
in
this
particular
case
there
was
such
a
failure
of
proof
they
did
not
have
to
quantify
it.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
must
be
and
your
honor
that
is
the
essence
of
this
case.
the
appellant
has
ignored
the
lengthy
trial
and
the
two
findings
of
the
appellate
courts.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
yes,
sir.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
that
is
correct.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
right.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
penn
central
would
be
entitled
to
relief
because
the
property
as
restricted
was
not
economically
viable.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
yes,
and
i
again
want
to
emphasize
the
attempt
by
the
appellant
to
ignore
the
substantial
factual
data
presented
during
the
trial.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
in
this
particular
case,
it
came
under
the
guys
of
the
challenge
to
the
application
as
a
deprivation
of
due
process.
to
answer
your
question
it
was
framed
in
response
to
a
due
process
issue
raised
in
court.
with
respect
to
other
challenges
internally
through
the
administrative
process,
we
allow
for
an
application,
for
a
certificate
of
appropriateness,
that
is,
even
to
the
extent
of
demolishing
the
landmark
parcel
if
it
is
not
economically
viable.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
no,
it
is
in
the
statute.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
but,
penn
central
was
a
tax-exempt
property
and
the
statute
did
not
have
this
exception
applicable
to
a
tax-exempt
property.
so
penn
central
sued
in
court
and
they
attempted
to
prove
in
court
what
they
could
not
prove
before
the
commission,
it
is
the
same
test
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
that
is
precisely
the
answer.
that
is
right.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
it
was
not
required
to
be
quantified
in
this
case,
but
it
has
been
traditionally
meant
that
on
his
investment,
he
would
be
able
to
earn
approximately
6%.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
correct!
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
no,
because
i
do
not
see
the
strength
of
the
public
purpose
in
that
particular
case.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
well,
then
again,
the
answer
to
your
honor’s
question
is
that
in
your
application
you
are
singling
out
that
particular
railroad
and
restricting
its
development
of
its
property.
the
entire
concept
of
this
scheme
is
that
we
are
not
singling
out
penn
central,
we
are
treating
it
like
every
other
landmark
within
the
city
of
new
york.
we
have
designated
over
500
properties.
indeed,
before
a
designation
is
completed,
that
designation
has
to
be
approved
by
the
city
planning
commission
which
must
determine
whether
it
is
consistent
with
the
zoning
plan
and
the
master
plan,
and
whether
or
not
any
urban
renewal,
development
might
interfere.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
there
are
two
bases
for
certificate
of
appropriateness.
with
respect
to
penn
central,
because
it
was
a
tax-exempt
property,
you
are
correct
that
they
could
not
have
gotten
a
certificate
of
appropriateness
administratively
because
the
economic
viability
question
was
not
allowed
since
they
were
tax-exempt.
with
respect
to
other
commercial
properties,
a
certificate
of
appropriateness
can
be
granted.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
that
is
correct.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
can
i?
i
just
want
to
use
my
time.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
section
207-8.0.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
no,
because
while
he
could
not
get
administrative
relief,
we
agree
that
if
he
have
had
established
his
case
in
court
that
the
property
was
not
economically
viable
he
would
have
been
entitled
to
judicial
relief.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
no,
that
is
correct,
under
due
process.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
if
we
had
not
had
the
added
step
that
whatever
deficiency
was
in
the
landmark
law
was
corrected
at
trial.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
that
is
correct.
but
it
is
not
the
issue
in
this
case
because
penn
central
had
the
opportunity
to
establish
under
the
very
same
test
and
fail.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
the
railroad
does
not
have
to
pay
full
city
real
estate
taxes
on
the
terminal.
there
is
an
exemption
under
the
railroad
law
for
that
portion
of
the
terminal
that
is
used
for
railroad
purposes
so
that
they
only
pay
approximately
one-third
the
assessed
valuation.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
it
was
intended
to
encourage
them
to
keep
up
the
railroad
system.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
no.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
that
is
correct.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
that
is
correct,
with
the
exception
that
here
though
you
can
equate
their
business
with
whether
or
not
they
can
make
a
reasonable
rate
of
return.
you
can
determine
it.
one
thing
we
have
left
out,
my
time
is
running
out,
but
i
want
to
emphasize
one
of
the
factor
that
was
quite
important.
we
have
concentrated
on
the
restriction
of
grand
central
terminal
and
whether
that
restriction
imposes
on
them
an
extraordinary
burden
not
present
with
other
land
use
regulation
impacts
on
a
parcel.
what
we
have
left
out
and
the
appellant
has
not
commented
on
the
air
rights.
we
have
never
contended
that
the
transferred
development
rights
were
equal
in
value
to
what
the
person
lost,
but
that
is
not
the
test.
the
test
is
whether
the
transferred
development
rights
constituted
a
valuable
asset
to
the
appellant,
that
when
added
to
his
return
on
the
railroad
which
he
was
unable
to
establish,
whether
that
satisfied
even
the
appellant’s
test
of
fairness.
now
i
want
to
briefly
mention
the
evidence
that
was
upheld
by
the
two
appellate
courts.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
that
is
correct.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
because
the
air
rights
are
part
of
the
comprehensive
scheme
in
an
attempt
to
at
least
recognize
that
we
are
going
to
try
to
do
everything
we
can.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
because,
judge
pritel
felt
that
the
air
rights
--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
no,
to
the
extent
that
he
relied
on
the
air
rights,
it
was
appropriate
to
consider
the
air
rights
in
the
context
of
the
whole
package
to
determine
exactly
whether
we
have
been
fair.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
because
the
fairness
concept
advocated
by
the
appellant
goes
to
the
concept
of
due
process
in
determining
value.
our
plan
contemplates
giving
the
individual
does
not
mean
this.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
no,
that
is
not
our
legal
position.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
that
is
correct,
but
there
has
not
been
in
this
particular
case
and
that
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
this
particular
case
show
there
has
not
been.
i
will
only
take
one
more
minute.
with
respect
to
the
air
rights,
the
testimonial
trial
showed
that
the
proposed
builder
upg,
had
offered
penn
central
$3.8
million
a
year
for
the
right
to
develop
air
rights
over
the
biltmore
hotel
an
eligible
receiving
site
under
the
transfer
development
rules.
penn
central’s
representative
testified
that
$3.8
million
was
insufficient
because
it
wanted
$5
million.
they
computed
the
$5
million
as
follows:
it
was
guaranteed
$3
million
if
it
developed
the
air
rights
above
the
terminal.
in
addition,
its
profit
from
building
biltmore
was
$2
million.
so
to
get
the
same
deal
that
it
would
have
had
with
respect
to
building
over
grand
central
terminal,
it
concluded
it
had
to
receive
$5
million.
i
urge
that
this
is
not
the
issue
before
the
court.
the
issue
is
not
whether
or
not
penn
central
was
entitled
to
the
highest
and
best
use,
the
$5
million.
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
the
$3.8
million
return
by
using
the
biltmore
site,
together
with
their
failure
to
establish
that
the
property,
as
restricted,
cannot
earn
a
reasonable
rate
of
return
is
so
unfair
as
to
really
in
all
effect
totally
emasculate
the
land
use
regulation
that
is
now
under
attack
because
in
a
city
like
new
york
it
is
unusual
for
all
of
the
landmarks
to
be
clustered
in
historic
districts.
for
the
preservation
purpose
to
be
accomplished,
it
is
necessary
that
the
landmarks
commission
be
able
to
act
wherever
it
finds
a
building
of
historical
and
architectural
significance.
the
total
plan
here
is
a
reasonable
one,
it
is
a
different
type
of
land
use
regulation,
but
all
the
courts
have
applied
the
traditional
rules
and
have
properly
concluded
that
this
regulation
should
be
sustained.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
no,
because
i
do
not
think
the
transfer
rights
were
of
the
equivalent
values.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
it
was
not
litigated
in
court,
all
that
was
litigated
--.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
that
is
correct.
