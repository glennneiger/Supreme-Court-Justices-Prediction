justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
koerner,
i
am
a
little
confused
about
your
references
to
tax-exemption.
what
specifically
is
tax-exempt
here?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
the
theory
be
that
they
are
taxed
in
other
ways
or
--?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
your
position
is,
as
i
understand
is
that
there
can
be
a
taking
sometimes
under
this
contemplation.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mrs.
wald,
just
applying
it
to
the
historic
landmark
area,
if
the
landmark
designation
causes
the
property
owner
to
actually
lose
money
on
the
property,
then
it
is
a
taking.
if
it
can
still
make
a
reasonable
return,
it
is
not
a
taking.
is
that
your
test?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
it
just
one
penny
a
profit
or
a
reasonable
return?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
we
have
to
decide.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
just
say,
just
a
marginal
profit
would
not
be
enough.
it
has
to
be
a
reasonable
return.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
a
reasonable
return,
how
does
one
measure
that
if
it
is
a
lot
less
then
it
could
be
obtained
by
putting
it
to
some
other
use?
is
it
still
reasonable?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but,
you
do
not
take
the
test
of
the
least
profitable
use
either.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well
i
think
as
i
heard
this
argument,
it
has
narrowed
the
issue,
as
i
understand
your
opponent.
he
conceives
that
there
might
be
occasions
and
circumstances
under
which
the
operation
of
this
ordinance
did
operate
so
as
to
be
a
taking
in
the
constitutional
sense.
you
concede
with
respect
to
the
statue
of
liberty
or
the
tree
in
brooklyn,
that
there
might
be
occasions
when
it
did
not
so
operate.
the
question
then
is,
does
it
in
this
particular
case
so
operate?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yeah.
