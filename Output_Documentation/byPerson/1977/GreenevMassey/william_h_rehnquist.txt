or
might
they
not
have
found,
felt
themselves
bound
by
the
earlier
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
too
which
said
the
evidence
did
not
meet
the
reasonable
doubt,
standard
and
went
on
to
city,
interest
of
just
as
require
a
new
trial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
certainly
is
apparent
from
the
supreme
court
of
florida's
opinion
though,
that
the
supreme
court
of
florida
intended
that
there
be
an
another
trial.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
agree
with
your
opposing
counsel
that
a
trial
judge
in
florida
is
faced
with
very
much
that
inquiry
every
time
he
is
confronted
with
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
a
motion
for
judgment
nov
after
the
jury
has
brought
in
a
verdict
of
guilty.
