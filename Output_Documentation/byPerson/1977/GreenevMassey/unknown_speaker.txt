unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
you
quote
from
one
paragraph
of
that,
on
appendix
page
3,
i
believe.
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
whole
gravament
of
what
he
said.
unknown
speaker
was
that
the
case
in
which
mr.
justice
douglas
has
a
separate
opinion,
made
a
distinction
between
cases
where
motion
for
acquittal
had
been
made
and
cases
where
no
such
motion
had
been
made
but
only
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
unknown
speaker
well,
this
court
was
simply
silent,
there
was
per
curium
on
it.
unknown
speaker
does
florida
have
a
ground
for
retrial
ordered
by
the
trial
judge
sits
in
effect
and
i
am
thinking
of
the
practice
in
my
own
state
of
arizona
as
a
thirteenth
juror
and
says
there
may
have
been
sufficient
evidence
to
warrant
submitting
the
case
to
the
jury,
but
i
think
justice
requires
that
he
get
another
shot
at
someone
to
grant
a
new
trial.
unknown
speaker
all
he
can
do
on
the
evidentiary
grounds
on
a
motion
for
a
--
say
he
just
has
no
authority
than
to
grant
a
new
trial
on
the
basis
of
insufficiency
of
the
evidence.
unknown
speaker
well,
then.
on
the
grounds
that
he
should
not
have
submitted
the
case
to
the
jury
in
the
first
place.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
if
you
make
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
on
the
grounds
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence
to
have
submitted
the
case
to
the
jury,
i
take
it
you
get
a
new
trial
and
not
a
dismissal.
does
it
not
constitute
a
waiver?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
the
law
of
florida
on
that
score?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
could
he
â€“
could
the
judge
deny
the
motion
for
acquittal
and
grant
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
on
the
grounds
of
the
state
of
the
evidence?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
do
not
see
why
it
is
so
illogical
to
connect
motions
for
new
trials
with
the
state
of
the
evidence,
when
in
all
full
lot
of
places
around
the
country,
brother
rehnquist
says,
new
trials
are
granted
on
the
grounds
that
the
evidence
is
not
very
convincing
to
the
judge.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
guess
--
he
just,
he
just
has
doubt
enough
that
he
grants
a
new
trial.
unknown
speaker
he
does
not
say
that
the
evidence
is
insufficient.
he
does
not
grant
the
motion
to
acquit.
unknown
speaker
if
the
law
in
florida
is
as
you
say
it
is
in
florida.
how
does
the
trial
judge
decide
whether
to
grant
a
new
trial
or
a
direct
judgment
nov
on
the
basis
of
insufficiency
of
the
evidence?
unknown
speaker
but
he
--
it
cannot
be
made
on
the
grounds
of
insufficiency
of
the
evidence?
unknown
speaker
within
what
criteria
does
the
trial
judge
apply
in
deciding
that
motion?
unknown
speaker
in
this
case,
you
made
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
a
motion
for
a
directed
verdict
of
acquittal.
unknown
speaker
and
both
were
denied.
unknown
speaker
both
were
denied
by
the
trial
court.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
just
looking
for
your
statement
of
the
case
in
your
brief.
unknown
speaker
that
is
right.
that
is
what
you
say.
and
were
both
made
on
the
basis
of
insufficiency
of
the
evidence?
unknown
speaker
including,
probably
the
insufficiency
of
the
evidence.
unknown
speaker
if
he
wanted
to
protect
his
clients.
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
state
of
the
law
was
i
suppose
that
--
to
deny
the
--
if
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
was
made
and
a
motion
for
directed
verdict
of
acquittal
was
made
along
with
each
grounded
on
the
proposition
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence
to
convict,
it
was
within
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court
which,
whether
to
grant
one
motion.
unknown
speaker
or
either
motion,
or
both
or
neither.
is
that
about
right?
unknown
speaker
in
the
trial
court.
unknown
speaker
which
you
do
not
have
the
benefit.
unknown
speaker
oh
you
do
not
have
any
acquittal.
unknown
speaker
what
if
in
the
trial
court
the
defendant's
counsel
moved
only
for
a
directed
judgment
for
acquittal
and
rested
on
that
and
that
was
denied
in
the
trial
court
and
that
was
appealed
and
the
only
ground
for
appeal
was
that
the
trial
court
erred
in
not
directing
an
acquittal
because
the
evidence
was
insufficient,
and
if
the
supreme
court
of
florida
held
yes
mr.
defendant
appellant,
you
are
correct,
now
surely
the
court
would
then
could
the
court
then
grant
a
new
trial.
unknown
speaker
no,
no
i
am
taking
about
in
florida.
unknown
speaker
even
though
the
only
error
alleged
and
sustained
was
that
the
trial
court
erred
in
not
directing
an
acquittal
because
of
the
insufficiency
of
the
evidence,
abstract
cases
never
a
reason.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
the
careful
lawyer
always
makes
a
double
motion.
unknown
speaker
and
was
that
a
case
in
which
the
only
motion
was
a
motion
for
directed
verdict
of
acquittal
grounded
upon
the
insufficiency
of
the
evidence.
unknown
speaker
now
what
is
that
case
is
it
in
your
reply
brief.
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
seem
to
have
your
reply
brief.
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
have
it.
unknown
speaker
it
is
a
xerox.
yeah
i
still
do
not
have
it,
i
will
get
it.
unknown
speaker
and
what
is
name
of
it
again.
unknown
speaker
mcarthur.
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
chandler,
do
the
florida
appellate
courts
have
that
power.
i
notice
reading
this
per
curium
that
it
can
be
read
as
saying
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient
to
establish
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
defendant
has
committed
murder
in
the
first
degree,
if
you
put
the
emphasize
on
the
last
phrase
it
might
be
implicit
that
there
is
plenty
of
evidence
to
convict
him
of
secondary
murder
or
perhaps
of
man
slaughter.
some
of
the
state
appellate
courts
have
the
power
to
forced
with
enter
a
verdict
of
guilty
of
a
less
included
defense,
and
in
some
states
i
think
that
the
appellate
court
do
not
have
that
power,
do
the
florida
power
courts
have
that
power?
unknown
speaker
but
they
clearly
could
have
converted
the
conviction
to
one
for
say,
seven
degree
murder?
unknown
speaker
finally.
unknown
speaker
without
impairing
your
client's
right
the
jury
trial.
unknown
speaker
could
i
interrupt
with
a
question?
unknown
speaker
do
i
correctly
understand
as
a
matter
of
florida
law
when
the
evidence
is
insufficient
the
appellate
court
may
either
direct
that
new
trial
be
held
or
the
judgment
of
acquittal
be
entered?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
thing
in
the
florida
law
that
tell
us
which
of
the
two
alternatives
should
be
granted
by
judge
in
any
one
kind
of
case,
and
how
does
the
the
appellate
court
decide
which
alternative
to
impose?
unknown
speaker
be
it
any
thing
other
than
what
was
already
on
the
record.
unknown
speaker
well
does
that
mean
mr.
hipler
that
we
read
the
interest
of
justice
language
to
mean
that
whether
that
prosecutor
represents
that
if
he
is
given
a
second
try,
he
can
come
forward
with
more
evidence
than
he
had
the
first
time.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that
you
told
me
that
the
the
only
reason
for
new
trial
would
be
the
supposition
that
the
prosecutor
had
additional
evidence.
unknown
speaker
are
your
answers
to
justice
steven's
question
based
on
statements
made
by
supreme
court
of
florida
or
by
your
own
observation
as
to
what
would
be
be
a
good
legal
system.
unknown
speaker
will
your
position
remain
the
same
if
the
appellate
court
had
said
normally
said
what
it
said
that
the
evidence
is
insufficient
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
but
they
went
right
ahead
and
said
the
motion
for
acquittal
should
have
been
granted
but
nevertheless
we
are
ordering
a
new
trial.
unknown
speaker
as
far
as
double
jeopardy
is
concerned
you
will
make
the
same
argument.
unknown
speaker
what
they
said
all
but
that
they
said--
unknown
speaker
well
is
this
what
the
florida
court
said,
we
are
the
of
view
that
the
evidence
was
definitely
lacking
and
establishing
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
that
the
defendant
has
committed
murder
in
the
first
degree.
unknown
speaker
well
technically.
well
actually
in
every
other
way
that
is
what
they
said
and
if
there
is
a
follow
up
from
that,
that
the
motion
for
acquittal
should
have
been
granted.
unknown
speaker
why
they
said
that
was
insufficient
to
prove
guilt
beyond
a
reason
for
that.
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
fine
if
they
are
going
to
retry
for
second
degree
murder,
they
are
retrying
for
first
degree.
no
no
the
question
was
whether
the
appellate
court
on
its
own
could
do
that.
could
convert
the
conviction
into
one
for
second
degree
murder
finally
with
no
new
trial.
unknown
speaker
correct.
unknown
speaker
mr.
hiller,
do
you
take
the
view
that
florida
has
category
of
cases
in
which
the
evidence
is
insufficient
to
prove
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
unless
24
juries
unanimously
agree
that
it
is
enough.
is
that
the
rule?
unknown
speaker
and
12
jurors
convict?
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
enough,
but
if
24
jurors
convict
under
the
same
evidence
then
it
is
enough.
unknown
speaker
well
that
is
just
what
the
double
jeopardy
clause
prohibits,
does
not
it?
unknown
speaker
i
am
asking
what
is
your
hypothesis
as
to
why
they
did
not
do
that?
unknown
speaker
maybe
he
was
guilty
of
first
degree?
unknown
speaker
mr
hipler
is
it
not
entirely
possible
that
the
defense
theory
was
it
was
some
other
person
entirely.
there
was
an
alibi
or
something
like
that
and
so
that
either
he
was
guilty
of
first
degree
murder
or
nothing?
unknown
speaker
either
way
but
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
that
it
would
have
appropriate
to
enter
a
second
degree
murder
conviction
is
there.
unknown
speaker
now
but
we
cannot
decide
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
the
record
would
support
a
second
degree
murder
conviction
can
we?
because
the
record
simply
does
not
tell
us.
unknown
speaker
do
not
you
think,
at
this
decision
of
the
state
court
is
saying,
as
the
court
saying
if
we
had
to
decide
that,
if
we
had
to
affirm
or
reverse
this
conviction,
we
would
affirm
but
we
prefer
to
order
a
new
trial.
unknown
speaker
but
why
do
say
the
interest
of
justice
require
that
if
the
man
is
proved
there
is
enough
evidence
to
support
the
conviction,
then
why
is
it
not
the
duty
of
the
appellate
court
to
affirm?
why
is
it
acting
lawlessly
when
it
says
well
it
is
a
close
case,
i
think
may
be
it
is
a
nice
defendant
or
something.
i
give
them
another
trial.
why
should
the
appellate
court
ever
do
that?
unknown
speaker
is
that
a--
not
of
that
kind--
discretion
of
that
kind?
where
do
you
find
any
opinion
saying
there
is
discretion
of
that
kind
in
an
appellate
court?
unknown
speaker
now
that
is
not
my
question.
do
you
know
of
any
opinion
of
an
appellate
court
saying
that
even
though
we
think
the
evidence
was
sufficient
to
go
to
the
jury,
nevertheless
in
the
interest
of
justice
we
will
order
a
new
trial
because
we
think
may
be
the
defendant
will
win
the
second
trial?
that
is
really
what
you
are
arguing
and
that
seems
to
me
you
are
arguing
for
a
lawless
behavior
by
an
appellate
court.
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
the
court
did
here--
unknown
speaker
now
you
on
page
29
of
your
brief
you
cite
a
good
many
statutes
from
various
states,
seeming
to
authorize
retrial
after
finding
by
an
appellate
court
that
the
evidence
is
insufficient.
unknown
speaker
i
mean
that
they
do
not
expressly
say
that
they
may
that
the
courts
may
grant
a
new
trial
when
they
find
the
evidence
insufficient
to
establish
guilt.
unknown
speaker
these
statutes
do
not
say
that
i
do
not
know
why
are
you
cited
them?
unknown
speaker
perhaps
without
showing
that
there
are
some
cases
under
the
statutes
applying
them
that
--
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
trial
court,
you
can
urge
the
weight
of
the
evidence
on
the
trial
court
in
a
motion
for
a
new
trial?
unknown
speaker
well
,
i
am
distinctly
confused
because
and
i
suspect
perhaps,
i
am
not
the
only
one.
i
thought
both
you
and
your
opponent
agreed
that
a
florida
trial
judge
after
a
jury
has
broaden
a
verdict
of
guilty
in
a
criminal
case
could
have
presented
to
him
a
motion
for
judgment
nov,
which
would
mean
he
enters
the
judgment
of
acquittal
or
a
motion
for
mistrial
one
of
the
grounds
for
which
would
be
against
the
weight
of
the
evidence--
motion
for
new
trial.
unknown
speaker
and
at
all
he
can
do
if
he
grants
that
motion
is
to
grant
a
new
trial.
well,
then
there
are
two
separate
concepts
involved,
are
they
not?
one
is
against
the
weight
of
the
evidence
and
the
other
is
total
insufficiency
of
the
evidence.
unknown
speaker
is
the
trial
court's
refusal
to
grant
a
motion
for
a
new
trial,
appealable
under
florida
law?
unknown
speaker
what
grounds
does
the
appellate
court
use
for
reviewing
that
denial?
unknown
speaker
let
us
suppose
the
florida
court
had
said
the
evidence
is
technically
sufficient
to
affirm,
but
it
is
weak
and
we
are
going
to
grant
a
new
trial,
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
is
that
your
argument
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
requires
the
court
either
to
affirm
or
reverse.
