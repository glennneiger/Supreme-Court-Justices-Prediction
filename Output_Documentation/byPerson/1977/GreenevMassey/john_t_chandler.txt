mr.
john
t.
chandler
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
am
john
chandler
attorney
for
the
petitioner
richard
greene
admitted
pro
hac
vice
in
case
number
76-6617.
this
case
arises
upon
the
petition
for
the
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
the
decision
of
the
us
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
which
affirmed
the
denial
of
habeas
corpus
relief
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
middle
district
of
florida.
the
issues
presented
in
this
case
are
twofold,
one
brought
forth
by
the
petitioner
and
one
brought
forth
by
the
respondent
raymond
massey.
first
issue
is
whether
the
double
jeopardy
clause
in
fifth
amendment
bars
retrial
of
the
defendant
for
the
same
offense
where
in
appellate
court
reverses
a
conviction
because
the
evidence
was
insufficient
to
prove
the
charged
crime.
secondary
issue,
in
one
which
respondent
would
have
as
threshold
is
whether
federal
habeas
corpus
review
of
the
double
jeopardy
claim
is
precluded
after
consideration
of
that
claim
by
the
state
courts.
the
case
briefly
and
it
is
a
case
that
arises
some
13
years
ago
or
almost
13
years
ago.
in
1965,
richard
greene
and
jose
manuel
sosa
were
found
guilty
of
first
degree
murder,
they
had
a
trial
by
jury,
they
made
both
a
motion
for
directed
verdict
of
acquittal
and
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
it
is
noteworthy
that
the
motion
for
new
trial
was
stricken
and
never
was
operative.
on
november
in
1968,
the
florida
supreme
court,
on
appeal
of
this
death
penalty
case
reversed
the
conviction
and
remanded
for
a
new
trial.
due
to
the
insufficiency
of
the
evidence,
this
was
a
per
curiam
decision
and
was
unequivocal
as
for
the
reason
for
the
reversal.
upon
remand
of
this
reversal
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
there
was
a
change
of
venue.
defendant
was
tried
then
in
orange
county,
florida
instead
of
in
hillsborough
county,
florida.
in
the
trial
court,
at
that
time
the
defendant
made
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
double
jeopardy
grounds.
alternatively,
he
asked
that
the
case
be
transferred
to
the
criminal
court
of
record
because
in
florida
the
criminal
court
of
record
would
then
have
jurisdiction
so
as
we
will
no
longer
be
operating
in
a
first
degree
murder
situation.
that
motion
was
denied,
at
that
time
the
defendant
applied
to
the
second
district
court
of
appeal
with
a
suggestion
for
writ
of
prohibition
to
prevent
again
on
double
jeopardy
grounds,
his
retrial
for
that
same
offense.
now
this
was
denied
by
the
second
district
court
of
appeal.
on
january
15th,
1972
after
defendant
was
retried
again
for
first
degree
murder,
he
was
convicted
and
the
prosecution
at
that
time
presented
new
witnesses
and
the
defendant
after
the
trial
was
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment
this
time
rather
than
the
death
penalty
upon
a
jury
verdict
recommending
mercy.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
it
is
in,
yes
sir
it
is
in
the
record,
justice
marshall.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
oh,
in
the
record
of
this
case?
mr.
john
t.
chandler
it
is
not
contained
in
the
appendix
of
this
case.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
that
is
correct,
that
decision
is
not
in.
after
the
retrial
and
after
he
was
again
convicted.
the
defendant
then
appealed
to
the
fourth
district
court
of
appeal
of
florida
which
affirmed
the
conviction.
that
court
recognize
that
the
issue
was
an
intriguing
one
intellectually
but
felt
for
some
reason
not
apparent
in
florida
law
that
they
could
not
decide
the
double
jeopardy
claim
because
of
the
second
district
court's
opinion
which
had
said
that
the
retrial
did
not
violate
double
jeopardy.
they
said
that
the
issue
was
res
judicata
and
therefore
they
could
not
decide
it.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
do
not
believe
the
fourth
district
court
of
appeal
was
at
all
motivated
by
that.
it
was
motivated
only
by
the
second
district
court
of
appeals
opinion
which
had
denied
the
writ
of
prohibition.
the
second
district
court
of
appeal
had
for
some
reason
or
had
recognized
a
standard
of
proof
which
they
said
that
the
supreme
court
did
not
reverse
because
of
the
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
but
that
certainly
is
not
apparent
from
the
supreme
court's
opinion
and
also
was
not
required
by
the
second
district
court
of
appeal
to
recognize
that
type
of
legal
proposition.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
absolutely
that
is
correct.
in
1975,
this
court
denied
a
writ
of
certiorari
on
this
issue
and
in
1976
the
u.s.
district
court
from
middle
district
of
florida
denied
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
recognizing,
also
the
interesting
nature
of
the
issue
and
saying
that
it
would
have
been
inclined
to
grant
the
writ,
had
the
matter
been
of
matter
of
first
impression
in
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
but
that
because
there
was
prior
precedent
in
it
and
because
the
prior
precedent
of
the
fifth
circuit
would
allow
retrial,
he
had
to
deny
the
writ.
the
us
court
of
appeals
in
january
of
1977,
affirmed
the
fifth
circuit
court
opinion
on
the
basis
of
the
precedent
that
the
district
court
had
recognized
namely,
united
states
versus
bass
and
musquiz
versus
united
states.
now
if
the
petitioner's
proposition
in
position
that
the
florida
supreme
court
held
the
evidence
to
be
insufficient
as
a
matter
of
law,
both
the
us
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
recognized
that
this
was
the
case.
if
the
trial
judge
had
directed
acquittal
when
the
original
motion
for
directed
verdict
had
been
made,
obviously
there
could
be
no
retrial
on
the
double
jeopardy
principles
because
at
that
time
the
man
had
been
convicted.
the
florida
supreme
court's
holding
indicates
that
the
trial
judge
erred
in
not
in
acquitting
because
this
is
as
much
a
function
of
the
trial
judge
to
direct
a
verdict
of
acquittal
on
proper
motion
made
as
it
is
for
the
appellate
court
to
reverse
on
the
insufficiency
of
the
evidence.
then
why
should
the
not
the
appellate
find
the
insufficient
evidence,
not
entitle
a
defendant
to
a
directed
verdict
of
acquittal?
the
reason,
and
which
results
in
what
i
believe
is
an
anomaly
lies
i
think
in
the
history
of
the
double
jeopardy
cases
before
this
court.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
excuse
me.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
they
could
have
done
so
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
but
they
did
not.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
that
would
be
my
problem,
it
is
my
problem
here
but
that
is
not.
the
law
of
florida
is
that
when
a
court
reverses
on
the
insufficiency
of
evidence,
they
may
reverse
and
remand
for
a
new
trial
and
so
that
the
question
does
not
arise
as
to
whether
they
could
have
said
what
the
trial
judge's
actual
duty
is,
in
fact
in
a
recent
--.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
that
is
correct,
that
is
what
the
court
is
saying,
you
get
a
new
trial
rather
than
saying
in
the
interest
of
justice,
a
new
trial
is
not
the
proper
vehicle
in
fact
the
directed
verdict.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
well,
with
a
choice
like
that,
there
either
really
is
no
choice
and
as
i
say
the
reason
for
the
treatment
of
double
jeopardy
and
retrial
in
situations
like
this
comes
from
a
line
of
cases
from
this
court.
the
earliest
being
united
states
versus
ball
and
in
the
ball
case,
the
reversal
was
based
upon
an
insufficient
indictment
and
in
that
situation,
we
did
not
quibble
and
we
did
not
argue
that
retrial
would
not
be
proper.
the
first
case,
and
the
real
troubling
case
and
the
case
that
troubles
all
of
the
circuit
courts
of
united
states
and
many
of
the
trial
of
the
state
courts
is
brian
versus
united
states.
where
this
court
said
that
retrial
after
finding
of
insufficient
evidence
did
not
violate
the
double
jeopardy
principle.
apparently,
because
of
a
notion
that
by
appealing
the
defendant
waived
the
double
jeopardy
argument.
at
that
time,
the
possibility
that
there
may
be
a
reason
to
delineate
reversals
for
insufficient
evidence
and
reversals
for
other
trial
era
did
not
seem
to
--
it
was
not
apparent
to
the
court.
but
in
sapir
versus
united
state,
this
court
reversed
a
circuit
court,
united
states
circuit
court
opinion
of
the
tenth
circuit,
which
had
first,
reversed
a
conviction
and
directed
acquittal
and
then
on
rehearing,
under
its
power,
under
28
usc
section
2106
decided
that
it
would
remand
for
a
new
trial.
this
court
reversed
the
district
or
the
circuit
court's
opinion
per
curium
without
opinion.
in
a
concurring
opinion
by
mr.
justice
douglas,
it
was
stated
that
the
reason
for
this
was
when
a
directed
--
that
a
finding
of
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
was
entitled
to
the
same
treatment
as
if
the
trial
judge
had
directed
a
verdict
of
acquittal.
for
that
reason,
mr.
justice
douglas
said,
they
must
reinstate
the
initial
reversal
and
so
that
the
man
could
not
be
retried.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
that
is
correct
and
then
this
court,
seemed
to
accept
his
proposition.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
it
was
not
that
in
that
one,
in
that
case.
but
in
foreman
versus
united
states,
this
matter
was
in
dictum
at
least
seem
to
be
settled
just
as
justice
douglas
said
it
should
be
treated.
however,
the
foreman
case
was
not
an
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
case.
in
fact
it
was
the
--
the
problem
there
was
a
bad
jury
instruction.
it
was
reversed
for
that
reason
and
again
we
would
not
quibble
for
retrial
on
that
situation.
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
is
really
not
a
valid
criterion.
it
does
not
relate
logically
to
the
insufficiency
of
the
evidence.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
no,
your
honor,
the
trial
judge
does
not
have
that
power.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
oh
yes,
insufficiency
of
the
evidence,
yes.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
yes,
you
can
make
both
the
directed
verdict
of
acquittal
for
in
a
motion
for
new
trial
on
the
same
grounds
on
the
state
of
florida.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
i
do
not
believe
so,
you
honor,
because
--
mr.
john
t.
chandler
the
law
of
florida
is
that
you
may
appeal
both
the
directed
verdict.
you
may
appeal
your
denial
of
the
directed
verdict
of
acquittal
and
the
denial
of
the
motion
for
a
new
trial.
it
was
formerly
thought
in
florida.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
i
think,
it
is
not
settled
in
florida
whether
that
could
be
done
or
not.
i
believe
that
it
could
be
done
at
that
time
though.
the
defendant
could
appeal
the
denial
of
the
directed
verdict
of
acquittal
and
so
that,
what
i
am
really
saying
here
is
that
it
is
not
settled,
it
is
unclear
logically,
i
think,
in
the
state
of
florida.
just
i
think
as
it
is
unclear
in
the
circuit
courts
of
united
states.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
that
maybe
only
in
florida
if
it
is
unconvincing.
there
must
not
be
sufficient
evidence
on
an
element
of
the
crime.
to
submit
the
--
mr.
john
t.
chandler
yes,
i
think.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
i
think
it
is
done.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
i
think,
how
does
the
trial
judge
decide
that?
i
am
not
sure
how
we
would
ever
decide
that
issue,
but
i
think,
logically
if
the
evidence
presented
before
the
jury
was
not
sufficient
to
convict
then
the
defendant
is
entitled
in
florida,
as
he
is
in
lot
of
other
states
to
directed
verdict
of
acquittal
and
so
that
a
motion
for
new
trial
can
be
made
on
other
grounds.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
it
can
and
in
fact
--
mr.
john
t.
chandler
i
do
not
believe,
i
do
not
believe
there
is
any
criteria,
i
could
not
delineate
what
the
criteria
is.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
that
is
--
well,
the
motion
--
mr.
john
t.
chandler
yes.
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
was
denied
actually
was
never
heard,
it
was
stricken.
because
an
appeal
had
already
been
filed
and
in
florida
trial
court
it
was
without
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
motion
for
a
new
trial.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
that
is
correct.
both
were
made
and
both
were
denied.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
the
motion
for
a
new
trial,
i
believe
was
grounded
on
several
and
different
errors,
one
of
which
may
or
may
not
have
been
--
mr.
john
t.
chandler
very
well,
could
have
been
and
the
reason
for
that
is
--
mr.
john
t.
chandler
that
is
right.
the
reason
for
that
mr.
justice
stewart
is
that
in
florida
the
law
is
very
unclear
as
to
whether
you
had
to
make
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
in
order
to
appeal
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence,
it
was
not
until
after
after
this
case
was
decided
that
in
other
than
death
penalties
cases
and
this
was
one
of
those.
whether
you
had
to
make
such
a
motion
or
not
and
later
it
was
determined
that
no
indeed
you
could
appeal
the
denial
of
a
directed
verdict
of
acquittal.
but,
that
law
was
very
confusing,
so
the
counsel
really
had
no
choice,
if
he
wanted
to
cover
the--
mr.
john
t.
chandler
yes.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
or
either
motion.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
that
is
about
right.
it
would
have
to
do.
and
i
say
that
is
because
there
is
no
previous
delineation
between
what
is
the
correct
procedure.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
that
is
true
and
still
the
defendant
could
appeal
the
denial
of
the
directed
verdict
of
acquittal
motion,
so
that
he
still
has
the
chance
of
raising
that
issue
and
reversing
the
trial
judge
on
the
denial
of
that
motion.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
i
am
not
sure
that
i
understand
but
if
i
--
mr.
john
t.
chandler
that
is
true.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
that
is
true.
if
there
is
error,
but
i
have
assumed
that
the
judge
would
do
his
duty
as
he
saw
it
and
would
reverse
for
the
proper
reason.
i
am
not
sure
that
i
am
responding
to
the
question.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
if
he
was
in
doubt
--
mr.
john
t.
chandler
yes,
i
am
sure
he
would.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
if
he
rather
than
face
the
issue
on
if
that
was
his
purpose
i
would
guess
that
is
what
he
would
do.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
he
could,
i
suppose
we
could
say
that
he
could
waive
if
he
asked
for
a
new
trial.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
well,
i
believe
we
do
your
honor,
mr.
justice
marshall
from
the
decision
in
the
case
which
is
cited
in
the
opinion
of
the
fifth
circuit
which
is
printed.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
the
defense
counsel
did
not
he
did
ask
for
a
new
trial.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
in
the
trial
court,
yes.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
and
reversal
for
certain
errors
he
would
be
asking
for
a
new
trial
that
would
be
retrial
for
errors
other
than
the
insufficiency
of
the
evidence.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
he
asked.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
yes.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
but
we
do.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
we
do
not
deny
the
right
mr.
justice
marshall
and
we
say
that
if
the
court
reverses
on
the
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
the
man
cannot
be
retried
if
it
reverses
on
the
other
grounds
then
it
could
be
retried
but
if
the
evidence
is
insufficient
there
should
be
no
difference
between
the
trial
judge's
finding
and
appellate
court's
finding
and
therefore
either
case
he
would
been
having
been
entitled
to
directed
verdict
of
acquittal,
he
would
have
been
subjected
to
multiple
trials
which
is
the
real
test
for
double
jeopardy
i
believe
in
the
cases
of
the
district
court.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
yes.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
no.
we
do
not
have
a
final
acquittal
but
we
have
the
--.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
no,
we
do
not
we
have
the
supreme
court
saying
that
the
trial
judge
erred
and
not
--
they
said
that
the
evidence
is
insufficient
to
convict
meaning
the
jury
did
not
have
sufficient
evidence
before
him
to
convict
this
man
and
therefore
he
was
entitled
to
an
acquittal
if
that
was
the
state
of
the
law.
i
believe
that
it
after
foreman
and
sapir
that
it
probably
is
the
state
of
a
law
and
it
definitely
should
be
the
state
of
the
law.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
absolutely
no
doubt
your
honor
and
this
is
a
little
different
from
that
because
we
are
talking
about.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
that
is
right
we
are
talking
about
entitlement
to
it
and
in
florida
you
will
not.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
that
is
correct
and
you
will
never
get
and
i
believe
in
florida
that
those
magic
words
you
will
always
get
a
retrial
even
if
the
court
says
the
trial
judge
erred
in
not
finding
the
evidence
sufficient
or
insufficient
and
they
would
remand
for
a
new
trial.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
under
law
established
by
this
court
under
foreman,
i
believe
--
mr.
john
t.
chandler
in
florida,
yes
he
could.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
mr.
justice
that
language
is
never
a
reason.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
that
language
is
never
reason.
that
situation
in
effect
has
a
reason
and
has
reason
very
recently
in
florida
in
a
case
that
was
submitted
in
our
reply
brief
and
mcarthur
versus
state
and
in
fact
they
have
said
the
evidence
as
in
sufficient
and
in
the
interest
of
justice,
we
remand
for
a
new
trial
under
florida's
appellant
rule
which
the
fifth
circuit
says
is
coextensive
with
the
28
u.s.c
2106
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
no
it
was
not,
but
what
i
am
saying
is
that
case
is
so
strong
would
show
that
the
result
would
be
the
same
in
florida
and
indeed
would
be
the
same
in
some
other
states.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
yes
it
is
in
the
reply
brief.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
the
reply
brief
was
filed
last
week
at
the--
mr.
john
t.
chandler
alright.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
the
opinion
is,
it
was
decided
by
the
florida
supreme
court
on
september
30th
of
this
year.
it
is
case
number
49-526.
i
can
not
supply
a
copy
of
the
case.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
mcarthur
versus
state.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
our
whole
position
is
grounded
on
greene
versus
unites
state
which
was
incorporated
which
was
incorporated
in
wilson
and
jenkins
and
that
the
underlying
principle
of
double
jeopardy.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
our
position
succinctly
stated
is
that
a
finding
of
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
on
appeal
should
have
the
same
remedy
as
a
directed
verdict
of
acquittal
if
the
trial
judge
had
remitted,
had
ordered
that
in
either
case
double
jeopardy
prevents
retrial.
this
is
based
upon
underlying
principle
of
double
jeopardy,
be
the
prevention
of
the
expense
ordeal
harassment
of
the
defendants
by
subjection
to
multiple
trials,
defendant
so
that
even
one
who
is
innocent
stands
a
greater
chance
of
being
found
guilty.
the
effect
of
deciding
in
petitioners
favor
today
would
be
that
the
appellate
courts
may
direct
entry
of
a
judgment
for
a
lesser
included
defense
if
the
evidence
is
adequate
on
the
record.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
yes
respondent
has
cited
that
in
is
brief
as
one
of
the
alternatives
the
court
has
and
we
would
also
say
the
appellate
court,
of
course,
could
direct
an
acquittal,
all
the
included
defenses
as
well.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
yes
they
could
do
so.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
that
is
true.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
that
is
true.
retrial
after
mistrial
and
all
of
the
other
situations
previously
before
this
court
in
double
jeopardy
situations,
upon
reversal
say,
for
other
trial
error
other
than
insufficient
evidence
is
not
affected
by
the
result
that
we
seek
today,
i
will
reserve
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
yes
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
on
the
last
point
about
the
similar
state
rules
and
statutes
it
is
very
clear,
that
you
can
look
at
some
of
those
in
the
list
and
you
will
find
arizona,
new
mexico
and
north
carolina
are
listed
among
them.
those
states
have
a
case
law
to
the
contrary
that
you
cannot
retry
a
man,
if
the
appellate
court
finds
the
evidence
insufficient.
those
cases
i
believe
are
cited
in
my
brief.
the
state's
conclusion
that
there
is
a
possibility
that
the
evidence
is
technically
sufficient
but
the
weight
of
the
evidence
requires
a
new
trial
this
proposition
is
not
allowed
in
florida
and
this
is
the
weight
of
the
evidence
is
the
province
of
the
jury.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
yes,
you
could
urge
the
weight
of
the
evidence
you
can
do
that
at
either
level,
but
it
is
the
entire
weight
of
the
evidence
then
goes
to
whether
there
is
proof
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
motion
for
a
new
trial.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
your
honor,
there
maybe
inherent
and
this
whole
idea
two
separate
the
concepts
of
the
evidence,
but
what
we
have
here
is
the
florida
supreme
court
saying
that
an
appellate
court,
for
instance,
which
is
ruling
on
what
a
state
court
or
what
the
trial
court
did
in
state
versus
smith
249
f.
2d.
16
saying
that
there
position
that
the
state
is
arguing
here
does
not
exist
in
florida
that
the
jury
if
the
evidence
is
sufficient
that
the
appellate
court
must
affirm
and
that
the
only
time
that
the
appellate
court
does
not
affirm
is
when
the
evidence
is
not
sufficient
as
a
matter
of
law
to
prove
the
crime
charged
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
and
they
have
reversed
the
same
dca,
in
fact,
which
was
involved
in
the
lower,
in
the
opinion
the
one
that
did
not
grant
the
writ
of
prohibition
in
this
case,
used
this
rule
of
law
to
decide
not
to
grant
the
writ
of
prohibition
and
the
florida
supreme
court
says
no
that
kind
of
law
does
not
exist
at
state
versus
smith
249
f.
2d.
16.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
your
honor
i
can
only
say,
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
whether
the
judge
abuses
discretion,
i
would
broadly
state
it.
mr.
john
t.
chandler
yes.
