justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
chandler,
the
first
opinion
of
the
court,
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
is
that
in
the
record
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
whole
thing
is
not
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
also
the
question
that
the
court
did
not
say
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
supreme
court
of
florida
could
have
said
that
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
judge
should
have
granted,
we
hereby
grant
it,
acquit
him
and
turn
him
lose.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
they
did
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
is
your
problem?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
brother
rehnquist
raised
his
point
that
he
emphasized
the
fact
that
what
i
am
actually
doing
in
the
interest
of
judges,
i
am
saying
that
you
get
a
new
trial.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
suppose
the
court
said
to
counsel,
i
will
give
you
a
new
trial
or
i
will
let
you
stay.
what
would
counsel
say?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
would
happen
if
the
appeal
asks
for
new
trial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
we
do
not
know
what
happened
and
goddamn
they
do
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
do
i
know
that
defense
counsel
did
not
ask
for
new
trial,
do
i
know
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
know
something
we
are
talking
in
the
supreme
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
did
he
ask
for?
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
do
not
know.
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
do
not
know
do
we?
you
have
get
that
won't
we?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
real
problem
is
how
do
you
differentiate
between
the
right
of
the
trial
judge
to
make
the
distinctions
and
deny
that
right
to
appellate
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
test
you
are
talking
about,
you
use
that
magic
word
of
acquittal.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
my
knowledge
of
other
case,
i
know
word
acquittal
is
in
there.
he
is
acquitted
of
one
offense
and
now
he
is
guilty
on
the
other
one.
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
just
do
not
have
the
magic
word.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
say
you
have
everything
but
the
actual
word.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
hipler,
am
i
correct
in
assuming
that
more
evidence
was
produced
at
second
term.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
what
we
should
be
arguing
at
the
exact
same
testimonial
was
in
both
trial,
would
there
be
no
double
jeopardy.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
the
state
is
entitled
to
two
different
juries?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no
but
no
if
the
exact
the
government,
the
supreme
court
said
that
this
is
enough,
not
enough
evidence
to
convict
a
man
of
first
degree
murder
and
then
he
is
tried
with
exact
same
evidence
and
that
would
not
be
double
jeopardy.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
not
have
to
get
a
little
more
evidence.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
what
you
are
arguing
is
that
it
was
not
just
the
insufficient
evidence,
there
was
also
an
error
involved?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
do
not
agree
that
the
defendant
gets
two
cracks
he
would
rather
not
have
eight
cracks.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
hypothesis
as
to
why
the
court
did
not
enter
on
its
own
motion,
judgment
of
murder
in
the
second
degree,
given
their
statements
that
have
been
read
to
you.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
the
supreme
court
of
state
'x'
says
that
we
would
examine
this
record
in
this
case
very
carefully
and
we
find
that
the
state
has
just
failed
to
meet
his
burden
or
proven
this
man
guilty,
this
time
around,
shall
we
give
him
another
chance?
you
can
not
tell
him,
i
have
given
the
defendant
another
chance.
they
are
giving
the
state
another
chance
here.
they
say
this
man
was
not
legally
convicted
solely
because
of
the
failure
of
the
state
to
prove
him
guilty
so
we
will
give
the
state
another
chance
to
prove
it
legally.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
said
insufficiency
of
the
evidence,
that
is
what
it
said,
did
not
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
court
that
gave
the
new
trial
said
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
which
i
understand
to
mean
the
state
did
not
prove
the
man
guilty
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
your
honor--
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
know
what
it
meant.
justice
thurgood
marshall
on
this
failure
of
having
a
prima
facie
case
and
insufficiency
to
evidence
and
the
difference
is
just
what.
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
you
have
a
sufficient
case
with
the
insufficient
prima
facie
evidence.
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
that
be
insufficiency
or
no
prima
facie.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
what
was
in
this
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
insufficiency.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
did
not
say
i
did
not
like
the
the
word
i
might
like
it.
i
am
saying
what
the
word
were
used
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
what
i
am
stuck
with,
i
do
not
know
whether
you
are,
but
that
is
what
i
am
stuck
with.
