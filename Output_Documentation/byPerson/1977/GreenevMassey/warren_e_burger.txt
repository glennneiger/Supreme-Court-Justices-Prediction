chief

burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
6617,
greene
against
massey.
mr.
chandler,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
judge,
the
trial
judge
could
avoid
any
possible
double
jeopardy
question
by
granting
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
on
the
basis
of
some
trial
error
raised,
could
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
trial
judge
is
concerned
about
double
jeopardy
problem
and
the
consequences
of
granting
on
the
insufficiency
of
the
evidence.
he
certainly
would
grant
the
new
trial
and
on
the
trial
error
would
not
he.
presumably.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
there
is
no
double
jeopardy
problem
rises
if
he
grants
a
new
trial
for
trial
error.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
is
insufficiency
of
the
evidence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
he
was
in
doubt,
suppose
the
dual
motion
is
made
as
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
has
some
doubt
about
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
and
he
has
some
doubt
about
the
trial
error.
i
repeat
my
question,
if
he
were
cautious
and
wanted
to
avoid
any
problems
of
double
jeopardy,
he
would
then
grant
the
new
trial
for
the
specific
trial
error,
would
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
avoid
all
these
problems.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
at
1
o'clock.
you
may
continue,
mr.
chandler.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
hipler.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
the
court
have
on
its
own
entered
a
regiment
of
guilt
for
second
degree
as
a
lesser
included
defense.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
failure
to
do
so
here
should
lead
to
what
analysis?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
weak
on
first
degree
murder.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
depends
on
one's
point
of
view
at
what
stage
one
might
want
two
cracks
but
later
stage
he
might
insist
as
he
does
now
on
own
only
one.
well,
it
prohibits
the
state
from
having
two
cracks
not
the
defendant
from
having
two
cracks.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
does
not
want
two
cracks
had
at
him
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
what
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
about,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
to
adopt
your
theory,
is
it
not
almost
necessary
to
carve
out
a
new
category
of
case
where
the
evidence
is
strong,
too
strong
to
lift
the
man
off,
so
an
appellate
court
thinks
but
not
quite
strong
enough
to
affirm
the
conviction
falling
between
the
two
alternatives
justice
white
posed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
hipler.
do
you
have
any
further
mr.
chandler.
