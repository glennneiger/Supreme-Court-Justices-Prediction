mr.
harry
m.
hipler
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
raised
two
issues
in
my
brief
the
stone
issue
point
a
and
my
point
b
the
double
jeopardy,
claim
i
want
to
argue
the
stone
issue
in
the
latter
part
of
my
argument
if
your
honors
please
to
reserve
several
minutes.
we
feel
your
honors
that
there
is
no
double
jeopardy
violation
when
an
appellate
court
reverses
on
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
grounds
as
well
as
others.
we
feel
that
the
federal
statutes,
one
is
2106
as
well
as
florida
appellate
rule
6.16
(b)
in
florida
as
well
as
some
30
states
statutes
allow
an
appellate
court
to
reverse
on
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
grounds
as
well
as
reversible
error
grounds.
we
feel
that
in
our
situation
the
case
of
bar
where
the
appellate
court
felt
that
it
was
appropriate
and
just
using
the
words
in
the
interest
of
justice,
the
trial
would
be
proper
upon
remand
it
was
within
their
power
and
discretion,
despite
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
in
the
case
of
bar.
we
feel
also
if
your
honors
please
basically
that
the
case
law
enunciated
by
this
honorable
court
through
the
years
has
permitted
what
the
florida
supreme
court
did
in
the
first
reversal
back
in
1968.
the
bryan
case
reversed
where
the
state
rather
government
there
failed
to
make
prima
facie
case,prima
facie
evidence
case
according
to
the
position
taken
by
the
petitioner
there.
the
yates
case
where
this
court
reversed
and
ordered
a
new
trial
and
discharged
other
defendants
and
went
ahead
and
said
if
there
has
been
some
evidence
as
to
conspiracy
in
the
1957
case,
i
think
the
words
were
used
probably
insufficient
as
to
some
and
there
was
some
evidence
where
the
jury
could
have
indeed
convicted
as
swither,
so
it
was
reversal
for
a
new
trial
as
a
sum
clearly
within
the
court's
discretion
rather
than
review
the
history
going
back
to
us
v.
ball
and
the
more
recent
cases
of
sapir
and
foreman
which
do
indicate
that
in
appellate
court
if
your
honors
please
do
have
that
power
to
reverse
for
a
new
trial.
we
also
feel
if
your
honors
please
that
there
is
nothing
inconsistent
with
double
jeopardy
clause
that
would
preclude
in
appellate
court
to
reverse
for
a
new
trial
that
the
public
policy
reasons
clearly
favor
the
government
or
the
prosecution
in
the
case
at
bar
and
we
do
not
say
in
all
the
situations
that
an
appellate
court
can
go
ahead
and
reverse
for
a
new
trial
or
government
may
take
an
appeal.
for
example,
if
the
jury
comes
back
not
guilty
or
if
a
trial
judge
enter
the
judgment
of
a
acquittal
then
it
is
clear
that
government
can
not
take
an
appeal.
also
if
there
is
prosecutorial
overreaching
in
the
sense
as
us
v.
jorn
where
discharge
of
the
jury
occurred
without
the
defendant's
behest,
without
his
request
and
it
did
not
fall
into
what
is
been
termed
adamant
necessity
or
absolute
necessity,
going
back
to
us
v.
perez
we
feel
new
situations,
the
law
is
clear.
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
yes
sir.
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
your
honor
florida
law
does
permit
that.
but
i
think
the
words
are
used
that
the
defendant
would
be
discharged
rather
than
going
ahead
entering
a
judgment
of
acquittal.
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
one
alternative
or
one
possibility
would
clearly
be
if
the
prosecution
could
not
further
adduce
any
evidence
in
a
subsequent
trial
then
it
would--
of
course--
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
right,
for
example,
a
possession
of
drugs
case
which
are
very
common
where
the
florida
supreme
court
has
discharged
the
defendant
because
in
constructive
possession
case
of,
course,
the
proof
did
not
show
(inaudible)
or
knowledge
and
so
forth
of
the
defendant.
that
would
be
one
situation
where
there
would
be
no
further
proof.
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
no
your
honor,
i
think
the
cases
decided
by
the
this
court
would
not
permit
that
where
the
interest
of
justice
does
indicate
as
well
as
the
concurring
opinion
as
joined
in
by
the
remainder
of
the
justices,
is
that
the
under
florida
appellant
rule
6.16(b),
in
light
of
the
fact,
it
was
a
murder
conviction,
and
a
death
penalty
case
and
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
the
weight
of
the
evidence
was
weak
then
the
appellate
court
can
go
ahead
and
reverse
for
a
new
trial.
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
no
your
honor
that
as
one
of
the
â€“
no
no
i
said
that
the
prosecutor
could
not
further
adduce
any
evidence,
then
it
will
be
senseless
to
go
ahead
and
order
new
trial.
if
all
the
evidences
in
the
court's
record
and
it
would
be
senseless
to
reverse
for
a
new
trial
for
failure
to
produce
any
further
evidence
then
there
would
be
no
retrial.
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
no
i
would,
by
my
observation
is
to
the
way
the
florida
supreme
court
has
been
operating.
i
have
a
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
case,
i
did
not
think
that
it
would
be
required
as
for
showing
the
court,
this
honorable
court,
whereas,
there
is
no
further
proof
that
could
be
adduced
at
a
subsequent
trial
as
to
possession
of
drugs.
then
the
defendant
was
indeed
discharged,
that
has
occurred
in
florida.
by
the
same
token
i
would
ask
this
court
to
take
notice
of
6.16
(b)
which
goes
ahead
and
reviews
the
sufficiency
evidence
in
the
favor
of
defendant
regardless
of
the
fact
that
whether
or
not
the
defendant
raise
that
on
appeal.
in
other
words
,
he
need
not
even
raise
it
and
the
supreme
court
goes
ahead
and
does
it
and
i
would
think
that
would
even
going
beyond
anything
of
course
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
or
any
thing
that
constitution
would
require
to
go
ahead
and
do
that
even
despite
--
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
your
honor,
i
do
not
know
where
mr.
chandler,
petitioner's
attorney
got
that.
i
do
not
--
the
record
is
of
course
devoid
of
what
was
produced
in
the
second.
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
your
honor
i
would
be
arguing
that
if
the
exact
same
testimony
would
be
produced
it
would
not
be
double
jeopardy.
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
pardon
me.
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
your
honor
the
fact
remains
that
in
a
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
--.
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
no
your
honor
that
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
two
different
juries
whether
weight
is
weak
that
is
the
point
your
honor
that--
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
your
honor,
i
take
issue--
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
your
honor
there
are
cases
which
are
close
where
the
death
penalty
has
been
invoked
where
you
would
you
see
proper
and
just
to
remand
for
new
trial
to
give
another
jury
an
opportunity
to
consider
the
same
evidence
or
whatever
evidences
they
could
produce,
that
is
what
happened
in
this
case.
that
is
what
i
am
saying,
there
is
nothing
improper
about
that
despite
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
i
have
relied
if
your
honors
please
on
the
concurring
opinion
is
joined
in
by
the
justices
which
indicates
the
reason
for
the
reversal,
whatever
the
words
reasonable
doubt
were
used
by
the
per
curiam
which
indicates
that
the
real
reason
had
to
do
with
an
improper
admission
of
here
say
evidence.
so
i
would
say
that,
that
was
of
course
the
reason
and
of
course
here
say
is
not
substantive
evidence
in
florida.
unless
you
fall
into
an
exception
and
he
did
not
fall
into
exception
here
so
there
had
been
more
of
a
procedural
error
than
a
substantive
your
honor.
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
yes
your
honor
that
is
where
i
am
suggesting
in
reading
the
opinion
that
goes
ahead
and
elaborates
on
the
point,
yes
sir.
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
well
i
would
certainly--
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
i
would
argue
that
but
i
think
the
that
if
they
said
that
the
judgment
of
a
acquittal
should
have
been
granted
that
would
certainly
weaken
the
prosecution's
case.
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
your
honor,
i
do
not
concede
that
they
said
all
but
that.
they
said
that
the
interest
of
justice
require
new
trial
despite
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
that
is
what
they
said
if
your
honor
please.
cases
in
florida
do
discharge
the
defendant,
i
certainly
could
have
cited
some
and
i
could
if
your
honors
would
desire
me
to
but
in
murder
conviction
as
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
me
that
defendant
indeed
gets
two
cracks
as
he
did
here
if
your
honors
please
that
is
what
i
am
suggesting.
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
yes
sir
that
is
technically
that
is
what
they
said.
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
no
your
honor
if
indeed
it
would
have
been
granted
or
should
have
been
granted
i
am
confident
if
the
state
had
not
made
out
of
prima
facie
case
of
guilt
but
it
probably
would
have
been
granted.
the
words
used
for
example
if
i
could
just
go
off
and
aside
in
a
contract
action
you
look
to
the
intend
of
the
parties,
not
necessarily
what
the
words
are,
you
look
behind
scenes
that
is
what
i
have
done
in
this
situations
as
well
as
the
fifth
circuit
and
us
district
court,
for
example,
us
v.
wiley
suggested
that
no
matter
what
the
words
were
used
by
an
appellate
court
it
could
not
be
improper
to
retry
defendant
and
not
be
violation
to
double
jeopardy,
if
the
weight
of
evidence
was
weak.
i
would
suggest
that,
is
what
the
florida
supreme
court
said
here
also--
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
yes
sir
that
is
what
the
words
that
were
used
by
the
florida
supreme
court.
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
your
honor
there
is
statute
that
provides
for
that
in
florida
that
does
go
ahead
and
do
that.
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
entering
a
judgment
for
second
degree
murder.
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
yes
there
is
a
florida
statute
that
allows
that
924.34.
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
your
honor
their
failure
to
do
so
here,
the
conclusion
is
that
they
felt
that
the
weight
of
evidence
was
weak
and
that
the
state.
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
enough
to
get
by
a
jury
but
because
of
the
death
penalty
being
invoked
and
because
the
conviction
for
murder
in
the
first
degree
that
the
interest
of
justice
required
a
new
trial
that
is
why
i
would
suggest
that
again
wiley
v.
us
which
favor
opposition
and
if
the
government
is
relied
upon
that
and
its
brief.
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
no
your
honor,
i
do
not,
but
i
take
the
view
is
that
where
evidence
is
technically
sufficient
to
get
to
a
jury--
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
yes
sir.
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
no
your
honor,
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
where
the
evidence
as
in
this
situation
was
enough
to
get
by
a
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal,
any
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
that
the
florida
supreme
court
4:3
said
we
are
going
to
give
this
defendant
another
chance
and
if
the
state
produces
the
same
evidence
and
the
jury
comes
back
guilty
and
indeed
the
defendants
were
guilty
that
is
what
i
am
suggesting.
now
i
would
also
submit
and
vigorously
argue
that
there
is
nothing
inconsistent
with
the
double
jeopardy
clause
to
preclude
that,
to
give
the
defendant
so
called
two
times.
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
yes
sir.
that
is
correct
unless
of
course.
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
right,
okay
that
is
the
point
also--
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
yes
sir--
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
right.
of
course
it
says
no
person
shall
be
tried
for
more
than
one
offense
and
so
forth
but
--
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
that
is
true
but
if
indeed--
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
because
it
felt
that
if
it
had
entered
a
judgment
for
murder
in
the
second
degree,
i
would
think
first
of
all
that
would
have
been
the
end
of
the
case
and
of
course
that
person--
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
they
felt
that
new
trial--
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
yes,
yes
sir
and
not
just
may
be
but
that
the
jury
had
come
back
guilty
and
motion
for
new
trial
was
submitted
to
the
trial
court
and--
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
well
your
honor
the,
that
may
be
the
case
but
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
that
and
--
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
well
your
honor
that,
that
may
be
true
but
it
is
not
the
duty
of
the
appellee
to
make
all
this
record
part
of
the
court.
we
were
never
ordered
and--
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
yes
sir,
the
court
went
ahead
and
reversed
basically
on
a
murder
in
a
first
degree
conviction
yes
sir.
i
would
submit
that
if
your
honors
please
to
go
on
that
a
case
that
is
even
more
compelling
where
the
state
or
the
prosecution
did
go
ahead
and
have
one
opportunity
to
test
its
case
in
front
of
a
trial
jury.
u.s
v.
sanford
and
perez,
and
those
situations
the
jury
indeed
came
back
with
nothing
and
if
the
logic
as
the
petitioner
once
applied
by
this
court
would
apply
and
this
court
would
adopt
it.
it
would
seem
to
me
in
those
situations
where
the
defendant
rather
than
the
prosecution
had
one
opportunity
that
the
jury
came
back
not
guilty.
here
the
jury
went
ahead
and
came
back
guilty
so
i
would
think
it
is
more
compelling
to
go
ahead
and
preclude
the
prosecution
from
retrying
where
jury
does
not
come
back
at
all.
that
again
is
one
consideration
i
think
this
court
should,
one
factor
this
court
should
consider
and
indeed
one
the
jury
does
come
back
guilty
there
is
nothing
to
preclude
in
appellate
court
to
go
ahead
and
reverse.
i
have
argued
that
from
the
totality,
the
evidence
we
feel
that
there
is
nothing
improper
about
going
ahead
and
reversing
for
new
trial.
also,
we
feel
that
the
policy
arguments
as
in
this
situation
where
there
is
intertwined
a
legal
and
factual
issue
it
is
in
the
hearsay
in
florida
--
the
vangallen
(ph)
case
which
is
cited
by
the
concurring
opinion
by
the
florida
supreme
court's
justice
erwin
where
the
questions
of
law
in
fact
are
mixed
and
those
situations
would
seem
to
me
that
it
would
be,
it
would
not
be
improper
in
such
situations
to
go
ahead
and
grant
the
retrial
for
example,
the
hearsay
being
considered
as
substantive
rather
than
for
impeachment
purposes
only.
so
it
is
not
really
easy
to
come
down
with
a
hard
and
fast
rule.
i
would
also
submit
as
a
policy
reason
for
this
court
to
consider
that
if
indeed
this
court
feels
that
there
is
a
hard
and
fast
rule
and
either
or
proposition
while
i
have
no
evidence
to
back
me
up
and
i
do
not
think
any
one
does
if
in
an
appellate
court
as
in
this
situation
feels
that
the
evidence
is
technically
sufficient
to
go
ahead
and
affirm,
if
this
court
does
indeed
hold
that
insufficient
evidence
means
what
it
says
without
going
behind
the
scenes
then
i
would
think
that
in
close
cases
where
the
defendant
would
be
benefited
by
retrial,
what
would
happen
is
that
the
appellate
court
may
indeed
take
the
way
out
and
say
would
--
we
are
going
to
leave
this
to
the
province
of
the
jury
rather
than
going
ahead
and
giving
the
defendant
a
new
trial.
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
yes,
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that,
that
the
court
could
have
affirmed
that
indeed
three
justices
would
have
gone
ahead
but
again
in
capital
cases
or
in
death
penalty
cases
florida
does
go
ahead
and
go
ahead
and
give
the
defendant
another
opportunity
to
test
the
state's
case.
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that
there
are
all
times
when
there
is
more
than
enough
evidence
for
jury
to
convict
and
the
appellate
court
could
go
ahead
and
affirm
but
it
feels
that
because
of
the
weight
is
weak
that
indeed
the
defendant
may
very
well
be
able
to
have
the
opportunity
to
test
the
prosecution's
case,
again,
that
there
are
times
where
it
has
indeed
been
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
but
in
such
situations
the
interests
of
justice
do
indeed
require
or
permit
the
appellate
court
to--
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
because
your
honor
there
is
a
certain
amount
discretion
vested
in
appellate
court's
--
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
the
fact
remains
that
many
appellate
courts
have
used
the
federal
statute
2106
to
go
ahead
and
remand
to
the
trial
court
and
on
the
other
hand
other
appellate
courts
have
gone
ahead
and
affirmed.
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
i
would
submit
your
honor
it
would
be
you
know
lawless
behavior
if
there
is
some
type
of
hard
and
fast
rule.
again
there
is
just
not
anything
improper,
it
seems
to
me
with
allowing
in
an
appellate
court
to
go
ahead
and
reverse
on
such
grounds.
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
he,
according
to
the
criminal
rules
3.600
grounds
for
a
new
trial.
one
of
them
is
indeed
that
the
verdict
is
contrary
to
the
law
so
that
is
one
of
the
considerations
by
the
trial
judge.
yes
sir.
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
no
your
honor
that
is
not
what
i
am
saying
if--
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
no
your
honor,
i
take
issue
with
your
honors
construction
as
to
what
the
court
did
here,
i
would
say
though,
that
if
indeed
there
had
been
beyond
the
burden
of
proof
that
it
would
be
incumbent
if
a
failure
by
the
state
or
the
prosecution
make
it
a
prima
facie
case
then
indeed
in
those
situations
that
it
would
be
the
duty
of
the
appellate
court
to
go
ahead
and
reverse
according
not
on
--
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
well
that
is
what
the
court
said
with
the
concurring
opinion
joined
in
by
the
justices
of
this
court
--
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
no
your
honor
i
am
saying
it
did
not
that
is
what
the
supreme
court
said
but
that
is
not
necessarily
all
the
considerations
that
went
into
play,
again
i
vigorously
argue
that
to
your
honor
in
this
honorable
court
that
you
can
not
go
behind
what
a
court
uses
in
for
example
like
in
a
contract
claim
or
contract
issues.
i
vigorously
argue
that
to
this
court,
there
is
nothing
improper
or
unconstitutional
in
such
a
situation
even
the
most
liberal
court
or
one
of
the
more
liberal
ones
going
towards
the
trend,
us
v.
wiley
has
even
permitted
that
where
they
say
there
is
nothing
to
preclude
and
appellate
courts
reverse
where
the
weight
is
weak
and
i
have
cited
that
can
in
my
brief.
there
is
appellate
mandated
acquittal
there.
whereas
in
failure
make
at
a
prima
facie
case,
there
may
be
very
well
be
an
appellate
mandated
acquittal.
i
have
argued
that
and
i
maintain
that
here
and
i
feel
in
the
state
feels
that
it
falls
at
a
minimum
with
in.
--
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
your
honor,
failure
to
make
out
of
prima
--
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
if
the
state
fails
to
prove
one
of
the
elements
of
a
crime,
then
the
trial
judge
would
go
ahead
and
enter
judgment
of
acquittal.
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
prima
facie
that
would
be
lack
of
a
prima
facie.
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
okay
it
was,
a
--
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
yes.
which
means
weight
of
the
evidence
i
would
submit
or
even
if
the
court,
or
your
honor's
do
not
like
the
word
insufficiency,
i
think
the
weight
of
the
evidence
would
have
been
a
better
word.
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
that
is
what
i
am
saying.
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
yes
sir
but
i
am
saying
that
where
the
weight
to
the
evidence
is
weak
where
there
is
nothing
to
preclude
a
retrial,
that
is
basically
what
our
position
is
and
of
course
a
legal
and
factual
issues
and
there
should
be
no
hard
and
fast
rule,
also
if
your
honors
please
i
would
say
that
when
a
defendant
goes
ahead
and
moves
a
for
a
new
trial,
where
he
maintains
control
over
the
situation
as
the
defense
counsel
did
in
the
trial
court
here,
where
he
went
ahead
and
moved
for
a
new
trial,
in
such
a
situation
where
i
have
analogized
that
not
exactly
to
motion
for
mistrial
but
rather
in
a
sense
where
he
requests
a
particular
relief,
and
i
would
submit
that
in
a
sense
that
us
v.
denets
(ph)
and
us
v.
lee,
does
indeed
support
the
contention
that
where
defense
requests
a
certain
relief
as
defense
counsel
did
in
the
trial
court
here.
there
is
nothing
to
preclude
in
appellate
court
or
trial
of
court
to
go
ahead
and
grant
the
defendant
exactly
what
he
requested.
that
is
also
what
i
am
saying
and
of
course,
good
policy
reasons
for
that
which
is
that
the
burden
is
on
defense
counsel
to
go
ahead
and
request
certain
types
of
relief
as
again
a
motion
for
mistrial
and
examples
of
that
nature.
if
your
honors
please
that
is
a
basically
the
state's
position
is
well
supplemented
by
the
briefs.
if
i
have
a
few
minutes
i
would
like
to
basically
just
argue
our
stone
proposition.
there
is
no
petition
for
certiorari
or
whatever
file
by
state
to
this
court,
i
believe
does
have
power
to
go
ahead
and
look
at
the
issue
after
swain
v.
pressley
the
district
of
columbia
statute
goes
ahead
and
holds,
it
has
no
suspension
so
called
writ
of
habeas
corpus
to
go
ahead
and
a
preclude
the
defendant
from
having
his
sentence
and
judgment
reviewed
ultimately
by
an
appellate
court
and
the
constitution
of
course,
does
not
mandate
more
than
one
appeal
indeed
it
does
not
even
mandate
one
appeal
according
to
some
of
the
recent
indications
by
this
honorable
court.
i
would
also
submit
that
2254
d
requires
petitioner
to
go
ahead
and
allege
that
there
are
some
kind
of
deficiencies
in
the
state
proceedings
that
was
not
done
in
the
case
at
bar,
and
i
would
submit
that
there
is
obviously
presumption
of
correctness.
also
2254
e
says
that
where
the
evidence
is
ample
that
the
burden
and
the
duty
is
on
the
applicant
to
go
ahead
and
submit
the
transcripts
and
trial
proceedings
that
was
not
done
here
and
again
it
is
not
the
duty
of
the
appellee,
if
your
honors,
please
to
go
ahead
and
submit
this
materials
to
the
trial
court
or
whatever.
that
is
as
to
the
stone
issue,
if
your
honors
have
any
questions
i
will
be
please
to
answer
them,
otherwise,
i
would
--
in
sum
i
would
say
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
invariably
been
read
by
this
court
to
be
a
balancing
of
the
equities
in
situations
and
i
would
submit
if
your
honors
please
that
the
policy
arguments
that
i
argued
here
in
my
brief
do
allow
an
appellate
court
in
the
interest
of
justice
to
go
ahead
and
reverse
for
a
new
trial.
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
your
honor,
they
used
the
exact
same
words
almost
the
exact
same
words
as
the
federal
statute
2106,
many
of
them
say
that
the
appellate
court
is
vested
with
a
discretion
one
or
two--
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
there
is
no
words
of
sufficiency
the
evidence
used
except
for
several
of
them
i
think
one
of
the
or
two
of
the
southern
states
that
i
have
cited
in
there,
i
can
not
recall
which
ones
say
that
the
sufficiency
evidence
will
go
ahead
and
be
considered,
but
none
of
them
do
but
in
looking
rather
than
me
going
ahead
and
picking
some
of
the
cases,
i
decided
to
go
ahead
and
submit
the
statutes
at
least
a
ones
that
i
could
find--
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
your
honor
i
cited
because
--
mr.
harry
m.
hipler
because
in
a
similar
vein,
the
federal
statute
allows
it
and
it
has
repeatedly
allowed
it.
so
i
would
think
it
would
necessarily
follow
that
the
states
would
be
able
to
do
that
also
that
is
why
i
cited
that
your
honor.
if
there
are
no
other
questions
i
would
ask
your
honors
to
affirm
the
judgment
conviction
and
the
judgment
of
the
fifth
circuit.
thank
you
very
much.
