arguments
next
in
state
of
washington
against
the

mr.
attorney
general,
i
think
you
can
reasonably
begin.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
at
that
point
at
10
o’clock
tomorrow
morning
mr.

mr.
attorney
general
you
may
resume

do
the
coastal
states
have
some
burdens
that
the
oranges
states
might
not
have?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
an
activity
more

mr.

chief

e.
burger
how
would
you
distinguish
the
statute,
one
levied
on
in
terms
of
a
charge
on
the
use
of
the
wharf
or
the
dock
by
the
one
of
publicly
owned
wharf
or
dock?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but,
i
am
wondering,
how
you
distinguish
it
from
police
and
fire
protection?
there
is
that,
certainly
when
you
are
importing
an
oil
you
have
the
particularly
high
fire
risk
or
if
it
is
something
even
more
volatile,
the
risk
goes
up.
now,
how
is
that
fundamentally
different
for
constitutional
purposes
from
police
and
fire
protection
routine,
which
is
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
cannot
bring
them
in
without
the
vehicle,
can
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
attorney
general
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
depart
of
revenue
of
washington
against
the
association
of
washington’s
stevedoring
companies
will
be
announced
by
mr,
justice
blackmun.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
