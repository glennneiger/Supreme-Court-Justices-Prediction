mr.
gorton,
now
that
you
are
interrupted,
am
i
correct
your
tax
does
not
apply
to
farming
or
to
insurance?
unknown
speaker
at
least
they
will
say
they
do.
unknown
speaker
but
unlike
the
commerce
clause,
it
is
a
direct
probation
on
--
unknown
speaker
well,
wyoming
has
coal
mines?
unknown
speaker
the
coastal
states
could
impose
a
tax
on
salt
water
fisherman
which
would
presumably
increase
the
cost
of
fish
in
the
interior
states
--
unknown
speaker
do
you
collect
the
sales
or
use
tax
on
the
transactions
involving
imports
delivered
in
the
state
of
washington?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose,
you
levy
use
taxes
on
--
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
i
wanted
to
know
--
unknown
speaker
do
you
not
levy
use
tax
on
goods
that
are
brought
over
across
the
border
in
oregon
and
brought
back
into
washington?
unknown
speaker
but
how
about
imports?
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
think
atlantic
richfield
applies
the
other
way
then?
unknown
speaker
some
other
day.
unknown
speaker
mr.
piper
just
one
observation
there.
what
he
says
in
canton
because
this
is
pretty
close,
he
ends
up
his
discussion
by
saying,
hence
we
need
not
decide
whether
loading
for
export
and
unloading
for
import
are
immune
from
tax
by
reason
of
the
import-export
clause
and
cites
carter
&
weekes
when
it
would
seem
that
carter
&
weekes
had
already
decided
it.
he
is
in
fact
saying
we
need
not
decide
whether
or
not
to
overrule
carter
&
weekes,
is
it
not
a
fair
reading
of
that?
unknown
speaker
he
had
been
one
of
the
two
dissenters?
unknown
speaker
one
other
question.
he
points,
he
draws
the
line,
the
acts
begin
and
end
at
the
water's
edge,
he
uses
that
language
in
canton
case.
this
activity
actually
goes
beyond
the
water's
edge
because
it
goes
into
the
hold
of
the
ship.
unknown
speaker
yes.
and
why
is
it
income
tax
on
stevedore,
state
income
tax
on
the
stevedore,
why
would
it
be
acceptable?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
may
be
good
enough
for
the
commerce,
but
you
say
that
the
clause
you
got
here
–
involved
here
is
got
a
better
reprobate?
unknown
speaker
why
is
an
income
tax
valid
under
this
clause
even
if
it
violates
commerce?
unknown
speaker
well,
whether
these
statements
are
made
or
not,
you
are
cutting
new
ground
now,
you
want
to
cut
new
ground
or
you
do
not
want
to
cut
new
ground
and
why
would
it
not
be
a
justification
for
sustaining
an
income
tax?
unknown
speaker
now,
stevedore
says
he
has
got
no
income,
but
stevedore?
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
grocery
seeds
tax
on
the
importer?
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
he
is
in
the
business
of
importing?
unknown
speaker
and
he
is
the
fellow
who
goes
and
picks
the
goods
up
from
the
point
of
rest,
where
the
stevedore
leaves
it
he
picks
it
up
and
he
is
the
importer
and
he
picks
it
up
and
then
puts
it
on
a
common
carrier
and
head
for
new
york
or
head
for
some
other
place?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
he
would
not
have
to
pay
the
grocery
seeds
tax?
unknown
speaker
what
if
he
always
is
going
to
do
with
his
–
sell
it
in
state,
does
that
make
any
difference?
what
if
all
he
is
going
to
do
with
it
is
to
use
it
as
a
raw
material
to
manufacture?
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
your
submission
is
it
that
in
order
for
there
to
be
a
violation
of
the
export
import
clause
there
must
be
a
tax
that
discriminates
against
imports
or
exports,
any
tax
--
unknown
speaker
any
imposed?
unknown
speaker
on
exports
or
imports?
unknown
speaker
violates
the
constitution
may
be
by
mistake.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
a
state
at
least
in
levying
its
impost
is
constitutionally
required
to
discriminate
in
favor
of
exports
and
imports.
unknown
speaker
well,
can
you
think
of
a
non
discriminatory
impost
or
duty,
i
guess
you
cannot?
unknown
speaker
as
long
as
you
have
something
that
is
non
discriminatory,
it
can
never
be
an
impost
or
duty,
is
that
you
are
--
unknown
speaker
well,
get
me
example
of
one
that
--?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
importer
who
imports
and
resells
it,
does
he
pay
the
goods
receipt
tax?
unknown
speaker
what
about
in
state?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
i
am
a
--
assume
i
am
a
food
broker
living
in
seattle
and
i
have
a
--
my
clients
are
super
markets.
i
specialize
in
foreign
foods
and
some
of
the
manufacturers
or
processors
of
foreign
foods
have
offices
in
seattle.
i
deal
with
them.
i
order
from
them
and
tell
them
to
send
their
goods
to
the
super
market.
i
specify
and
i
--
all
my
transactions
are
right
there
in
seattle,
but
i
buy
the
goods
and
i
in
effectively
resell
them
to
the
super
markets,
but
i
am
an
importer,
do
i
pay
the
goods
receipt
tax?
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
not
--
is
that
because
of
the
--
that
is
not
because
of
the
--
unknown
speaker
yes
not
because
of
the
--
unknown
speaker
that
is
under
another
clause,
if
you
do
not
do
that?
unknown
speaker
so
your
position
is
that
certainly
it
is
not
contrary
to
the
export
import
clause
to
tax
the
importer?
unknown
speaker
or
his
foreign
sale?
unknown
speaker
not
the
import,
not
the
export
import
clause?
unknown
speaker
and
regrading
on
that
point,
supposing
the
tax
were
in
the
form
of
a
specific,
a
transaction
tax,
for
each
ship
unloaded
you
pay
$100
or
something
like
that,
what
would
you
say
about
that?
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
on
the
activity,
it
would
be
on
the
activity
of
unloading
the
ship
regardless
of
what
the
goods
were,
the
value
or
anything
like
that.
why
is
that
any
different
in
this
tax
on
the
income
derived
derived
from
the
activity?
unknown
speaker
well
that
is
true
in
my
example
too?
