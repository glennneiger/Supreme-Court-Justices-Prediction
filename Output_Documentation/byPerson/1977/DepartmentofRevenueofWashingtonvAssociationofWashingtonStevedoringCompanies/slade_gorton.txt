mr.
slade
gorton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
state
of
washington
imposes
a
general
gross
receipts
tax
on
practically
all
services
performed
within
the
state.
together
with
a
similar
tax
on
other
business
activities,
it
is
the
principal
form
of
taxation
on
business
and
fullest
for
the
support
of
the
state
institutions
and
services.
the
source
of
any
goods
upon
which
taxable
service
are
performed
is
irrelevant.
there
is
therefore
no
discrimination
against
goods
originating
at
or
destined
to
points
outside
of
the
state.
in
puget
sound
stevedoring
versus
tax
commission,
in
1937,
this
court
found
that
that
tax
to
be
invalid
in
so
far
as
it
was
imposed
upon
a
stevedore’s
business
of
loading
and
unloading
ships
in
interstate
and
foreign
commerce.
the
basis
of
that
decision
was
the
stevedoring
“is
interstate
or
foreign
commerce”.
the
privilege
of
engaging
in
which
was
not
subject
to
what
you
then
characterized
as
a
direct
tax
by
the
state.
ten
years
later
in
carter
&
weekes
you
adhered
to
that
decision.
the
court
held
that
the
tax
was
not
properly
apportioned
and
that
the
risk
of
multiple
taxation
was
present,
because
both
the
state
of
the
loading
and
that
of
the
unloading
might
tax
the
stevedoring
activities
in
their
respective
jurisdictions.
stevedoring
was
not
considered
to
be
distinct
enough
from
the
transit
by
ship
to
be
taxable.
at
that
time,
of
course,
to
characterize
the
tax
as
being
directly
on
interstate
commerce
was
sufficient
to
invalidate
it.
four
justices
dissent
it.
you
have
agreed
to
review
the
soundness
of
carter
&
weekes
and
puget
sound
stevedoring
perhaps
in
the
light
of
your
recent
decisions
in
michelin
tire
and
complete
auto
transit.
we
submit,
however,
that
the
vitality
of
those
two
stevedoring
precedents
ended
as
long
ago
as
1951
when
you
decided
canton
railroad
v.
rogan
and
western
maryland
railway
v.
rogan.
roughly
half
of
the
canton
railroad’s
receipts
were
for
war
freight
services,
the
privilege
of
using
canton’s
peers
for
the
transfer
of
cargo
to
lighters
and
to
trucks,
and
for
switching
freight
carts,
loaded
with
imports
and
exports,
between
the
peers
and
trunk
line
railroads.
maryland
nevertheless
imposed
a
gross
receipts
tax
on
all
of
canton’s
income
including
that
from
these
services
for
imports
and
exports.
you
found
that
tax
not
to
violate
article
i
section
10,
as
it
was
not
levied
against
the
articles
of
import
and
export
because
“the
tax
is
not
on
the
goods
but
on
the
handling
of
them
at
the
port.
an
article
maybe
an
export
and
immune
from
a
tax
long
before
or
long
after
it
reaches
the
port,
but
when
the
tax
is
on
activities
connected
with
the
export
or
import,
the
range
of
immunity
can
not
be
so
wide.”
it
is
true
that
the
court
expressly
reserved
the
question
of
whether
stevedoring
fell
within
its
holding.
stevedoring,
of
course,
was
not
before
you,
but
a
tax
on
stevedoring
is
as
clearly
one
on
the
handling
of
goods
at
the
port
and
do
not
on
the
goods
themselves
as
was
the
tax
in
canton.
just
two
years
ago
in
michelin
tire
you
took
the
opportunity
even
more
carefully
to
examine
the
import-export
clause.
you
decided
there
that
a
nondiscriminatory
property
tax
on
imported
tires
in
storage
was
not
an
imposed
or
a
duty
prohibited
by
article
i
section
10.
note,
however,
that
unlike
the
activities
here
and
in
canton
the
tax
in
michelin
tire
was
levied
directly
on
the
goods
and
that
not
merely
on
the
activity
of
handling
them.
in
michelin
tire
you
examined
the
concerns
of
the
framers
of
the
constitution
in
drafting
the
import-export
clause.
we
found
three
such
concerns:
first,
the
necessity
that
the
united
states
speak
with
one
voice
in
regulating
foreign
relations
and
international
trade;
second,
import
duties
were
to
be
the
major
source
of
the
federal
government’s
revenues
and
should
not
be
diverted
to
the
states;
and
third,
harmony
among
the
states
was
to
be
preserved
by
preventing
seaboard
states
from
taxing
goods
merely
passing
through
on
their
way
to
interior
states.
the
respondents
here
do
not
suggest
that
washington’s
tax
has
any
impact
on
first
two
concerns.
they
do,
however,
accuse
us
of
a
tollgate
mentality
of
trying
to
get
something
for
nothing
from
the
citizens
of
other
states
whose
goods
use
our
ports.
they
are
in
error.
first,
it
is
somewhat
odd
that
respondent
should
so
castigate
tolls.
perhaps
they
hold
that
they
court
would
prohibit
the
state
of
maryland
from
charging
a
truck
a
toll
for
crossing
the
chesapeake
bay
bridge,
simply
because
the
truck
was
carrying
exports
bound
for
a
ship
at
the
dock
in
baltimore,
but
a
nondiscriminatory
toll
in
return
for
a
service
provided
is
clearly
constitutional.
the
validity
of
a
tax
or
toll
or
levy
is
not
determined
by
the
label
which
those
who
pay
it,
attached
to
it.
the
characterizations
or
assertions
upon
which
respondent’s
argument
rests
are
found
on
page
21
and
22
of
its
brief.
first,
respondents
claim
that
by
their
nature
the
imports
and
exports
passing
through
sea
ports
involved
stevedores.
next,
they
assert
that
almost
admit
that
a
tax
on
the
mover
of
imports
is
a
tax
on
the
goods
themselves.
they
are
wrong
on
both
counts.
mr.
slade
gorton
it
is
not.
i
am
simply
stating
that
to
characterize
it
as
a
toll
on
the
part
of
the
respondents
does
not
answer
any
of
the
questions
which
are
before
you.
it
is
up
to
you
to
determine
what
it
actually
is.
i
do
not
claim
that
it
is
a
direct
equivalent
of
the
toll
either.
i
just
say
the
tollgate
mentality
argument
is
irrelevant.
mr.
slade
gorton
this
specific
tax
does
not
apply
to
the
occupation
or
farming
or
to
insurance.
insurance
is
covered
by
another
tax.
there
is
an
insurance
premium
tax
in
the
state,
and
of
course
farmers
pay
a
disproportionate
real
property
tax
because
of
their
holdings.
mr.
slade
gorton
at
least
they
will
claim
they
do
successfully
to
the
legislature.
our
tax,
at
least
in
this
case
like
the
toll
on
the
chesapeake
bay
bridge,
is
not
levied
against
imports
or
exports
at
all.
for
example,
it
does
not
apply
to
imports
or
exports
by
air
or
by
rail
or
even
by
ship
when
no
in
state
stevedoring
services
are
provided.
the
table,
inserted
at
the
end
of
respondents’
own
brief,
is
perhaps
the
most
graphic
illustration
of
this
point.
neither
washington’s
most
important
export,
aircraft,
nor
its
most
important
import,
petroleum,
requires
the
use
of
stevedoring
services
at
all.
mr.
slade
gorton
they
were
and
they
do
not
use
stevedores
except
on
the
rare
occasion
when
they
are
being
shipped
overseas
rather
than
to
north
carolina
as
in
that
case.
thus,
neither
of
these
major
exports
and
imports
is
subject
to
the
tax.
on
the
other
hand,
our
tax
is
applied
to
the
analogous
intrastate
services,
the
freight
handlers,
for
example,
whether
the
destination
of
the
freight
they
handle
is
inside
the
state,
in
another
state,
or
in
a
foreign
country.
we,
like
maryland
in
canton
railroad,
are
not
taxing
goods
at
all,
but
merely
the
handling
of
those
goods
at
the
port.
respondents’
bold
assertion
that
the
two
are
identical
is
not
only
conceptually
at
error
but
repudiates
directly
your
holding
in
canton
railroad,
which
brings
us
to
the
analogous
limitations
of
the
commerce
clause.
last
year
into
complete
auto
transit
you
resolved
that
the
test
of
the
validity
of
a
tax
affecting
commerce
is
“not
the
formal
language
of
the
tax
statute
but
rather
its
practical
effect”.
now
that
a
tax
is
to
be
sustained
when
it
“is
applied
to
an
activity
with
the
substantial
nexus
with
the
taxing
state;
it
is
fairly
apportioned,
it
does
not
discriminate
against
interstate
commerce,
and
it
is
fairly
related
to
the
services
provided
by
the
state.”
respondents
here
do
not
deny
the
substantial
nexus,
nor
can
they
claim
that
the
tax
is
other
than
precisely
apportioned
because
all
of
their
business
is
done
wholly
within
the
state
of
washington.
the
tax
does
not
discriminate
against
interstate
commerce.
it
applies
equally
to
stevedoring
services
and
to
all
other
services
with
respect
to
handling
goods
whether
the
goods
come
from
or
are
bound
to
other
points
in
the
state
of
washington,
alaska,
or
japan.
finally,
the
tax
is
reasonably
related
to
services
provided
by
the
sate.
for
40
year,
respondents
have
avoided
the
principal
business
tax
applied
to
other
business
in
the
state
for
the
support
of
both
state
and
local
services.
it
is
time
to
end
their
free
ride.
respondents
claim
that
even
though
the
tax
may
not
be
discriminatory
now,
it
might
become
so
in
the
future.
in
both
complete
auto
transit
and
michelin
tire
you
found
that
assertion
to
be
insufficient
to
invalidate
a
tax.
the
rationale
for
such
a
decision
here
is
even
stronger.
mr.
slade
gorton
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
slade
gorton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
respondents
challenged
washington's
gross
receipts
tax
on
stevedoring
under
both
the
commerce
clause
and
the
import
export
clause.
both
are
relevant
as
the
stevedores
provide
services
for
goods,
both
to
and
from
other
states
and
to
and
from
other
nations.
since
complete
auto
transit
last
year,
the
rule
is
that
the
validity
under
the
commerce
clause
are
easy
to
state;
labels
attached
to
the
tax
are
irrelevant.
a
tax
is
not
invalid
unless
it
discriminates
against
inter-state
or
foreign
commerce,
is
improperly
apportioned,
is
unrelated
to
any
services
provided
by
the
taxing
state
or
applies
to
business
to
which
the
taxing
state
has
no
substantial
nexus.
non
of
these
objections
can
be
fairly
applied
to
this
tax.
the
import-export
clause,
on
the
other
hand
is
both
more
peremptory
and
more
narrow,
but
a
tax
may
run
afoul
of
it
for
reasons
which
would
also
invalidated
under
the
commerce
clause.
a
non-discriminatory
property
tax
against
goods
in
transit
is
an
example
which
you
used
in
michelin
tire.
such
a
tax
of
course,
would
also
be
improperly
apportioned.
mr.
slade
gorton
precisely,
that
is
my
next
point
was
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
the
peremptory
ban
of
the
import-export
clause
itself,
however,
is
directed
only
against
imposts
and
duties
on
imports
or
exports.
such
an
import
--
mr.
slade
gorton
it
is
a
direct
probation
and
in
that
sense
it
is
more
peremptory
and
specific
than
as
the
commerce
clause.
such
an
impost
or
duty
is
invalid
even
though
it
meets
all
of
our
commerce
clause
tests,
but
in
fact
there
are
relatives
few
such
levies.
an
example;
if
the
state
of
washington
imposed
a
manufacturing
tax
on
widgets
and
a
compensating
tax
on
widgets
imported
from
japan,
the
later
tax
might
well
meet
all
of
the
tests
of
the
commerce
clause,
but
it
would
still
be
an
impost
or
a
duty
on
an
import.
another
example
is
a
tax
on
bills
of
lading,
the
documentary
evidence
of
goods
and
commerce,
and
thus
a
tax
on
the
goods
themselves.
but
article
1,
section
10
does
not
apply
to
a
tax
which
is
not
an
impost
or
a
duty
on
imports
or
exports.
in
michelin
tire
you
found
the
property
tax
there
not
be
an
impost
or
a
duty
even
though
the
tires
might
still
be
imports.
this
case
we
submit
is
easier
than
michelin
tire,
not
only
is
our
tax
not
an
impost
or
a
duty,
it
is
not
on
imports
or
exports
either.
canton
railroad
points
out
that
the
effect
of
the
import-export
is
narrower
as
to
services
related
to
imported
goods
than
it
is
to
the
goods
themselves
and
that
it
does
not
extend
to
transportation
services
consisting
of
handling
of
goods
at
the
port,
which
is
exactly
what
the
respondent
stevedores
do.
our
tax
is
on
that
local
service
only,
ignores
both
the
goods
and
their
value,
deals
with
the
subject
which
no
other
state
can
conceivably
tax
and
is
designed
to
defray
the
fair
share
of
the
costs
of
government
provided
to
those
who
are
engaged
in
stevedoring
service.
it
ignores
that
large
class
of
imports
and
exports
which
do
not
require
stevedoring
services.
thus
it
is
not
infringe
upon
any
of
the
purposes
of
the
import-export
clause
which
you
outlined
in
michelin
tire.
mr.
slade
gorton
it
does
not
--
mr.
slade
gorton
you
certainly
could
have
decided
michelin
tire
on
that
basis.
the
intriguing
element
of
the
decision
was
that
you
specifically
declined
to
do
so
in
order
to
focus
on
import
levy
so
i
do
not
believe
that
has
any
significance
here.
yesterday
mr.
justice
blackmun
noticed
the
respondent's
claim
that
washington's
gross
receipts
tax
was
not
general
because
it
did
not
apply
to
every
single
business
occupation
in
the
state.
under
respondent's
theory
no
property
tax
is
general
because
some
property
is
always
exempt.
the
federal
income
tax
is
not
general
because
some
categories
of
income
are
exempt.
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
would
be
hard
pressed
to
find
under
that
theory
a
single
general
tax
anywhere
in
the
united
states.
mr.
slade
gorton
yes.
railroads
are
higher
mr.
justice
blackmun,
but
most
services,
the
great
bulk
of
services
are
taxed
at
this
rate.
mr.
slade
gorton
yes,
but
it
is
a
revenue
ruling
which
is
totally
consistent
with
the
state
statute.
the
only
reason
that
the
state
statute
has
not
been
applied
to
this
activity
previously
is
decision
to
decide
stevedoring
which
of
course
resulted
in
an
injunction
against
that
exercise
of
that
statute.
mr.
slade
gorton
i
do
not
believe
that
it
does,
but
i
will
to
believe
that.
mr.
slade
gorton
if
one
concentrates
mr.
justice
rehnquist
only
upon
stevedoring
services,
i
suppose
some
inland
states
would
be
able
to
do
so.
i
would
imagine
st.
louise
has
stevedoring.
there
would
certainly
have
to
be
navigable
waters
in
a
state
for
a
state
to
subject
its
--
mr.
slade
gorton
pardon?
that
is
exactly
the
answer.
wyoming
can
tax
coal
mining,
california
and
florida
can
tax
the
production
of
oranges,
these
in
a
sense
are
advantages
to
those
states
because
of
their
peculiar
geographical
nature,
but
they
do
not
rise
to
constitutional
significance.
mr.
slade
gorton
yes,
but
you
have
held
as
recently
as
michelin
tire
that
the
mere
fact
that
a
non-discriminatory
state
tax
which
does
not
affect,
which
does
not
deal,less
favorably
with
imports
then
it
does
with
domestic
goods,
does
not
violate
the
import-export
clause
because
it
does
not
meet
any
of
the
purposes
of
the
import-export
clause.
in
other
words,
the
mere
fact
that
a
tax
or
a
services
adds
to
the
costs
of
goods
or
services
in
some
other
state,
if
the
taxes
are
fair
one
and
fairly
apportioned,
is
not
a
ground
for
finding
it
to
be
invalid.
mr.
slade
gorton
everywhere
in
the
united
states,
but
you
would
not
void
that
on
the
constitutional
--
mr.
slade
gorton
certainly.
in
this
case
the
coastal
state
has
the
burden
of
provided
police
services
and
fire
services
and
every
other
governmental
services
for
stevedores.
the
state
of
wyoming
has
no
such
burden
for
stevedores.
mr.
slade
gorton
yes.
we
have
to
protect
our
waterfront.
wyoming
has
no
waterfront
which
it
has
to
protect
and
we
were
levying
a
non-discriminatory
tax
against
businesses
on
that
waterfront.
mr.
slade
gorton
only
when
they
are
sold
in
the
state
of
washington
and
we
cannot
levy
a
sales
tax
against
an
item
which
is
sold
in
another
state
whether
it
is
an
import
or
not.
mr.
slade
gorton
we
would
not
levy
a
use
tax
on
a
item
which
--
mr.
slade
gorton
business
or
commerce,
no.
mr.
slade
gorton
yes
we
do.
mr.
slade
gorton
yes,
i
believe
that
we
would
tax
an
import
which
came
to
rest
in
the
state
of
washington
and
was
being
utilized
by
a
resident
of
the
state
of
washington,
but
not
an
import,
this
would
of
course
involve
no
burden
on
people
in
other
states.
we
would
not
tax
--
we
would
not
levy
a
sales
or
a
use
tax
against
an
import
which
was
on
its
way
to
idaho.
mr.
slade
gorton
atlantic
richfield,
that
seems
to
me,
first
you
spoke
of
taxes
rather
than
imposts
or
duties
in
atlantic
richfield.
secondly
atlantic
richfield's
decision
does
not
need
to
reversed
or
overruled
in
this
case.
atlantic
richfield
is
taxed
--
mr.
slade
gorton
i
think
not.
atlantic
richfield's
tax
was
invalid
under
your
long
line
of
decisions
to
the
effect
that
a
sales
tax
can
be
levied
only
by
the
destination
jurisdiction;
which
in
that
case
california
was
not
and
you
current
law
has
not
threatened
by
any
means
the
holding
of
the
atlantic
richfield
case
and
we
do
not
challenge
it.
one
final
point
which
is
raised
by
these
respondents
is
the
implication
that
there
are
somehow
politically
powerless
outsiders
in
a
marginal
business.
interstate
and
foreign
trade
are
vital
to
the
economic
health
of
the
state
of
washington.
these
private
corporate
respondents
reside
in
and
do
business
exclusively
in
the
state
and
the
public
ports
association
respondent
represents
municipal
corporations,
so
politically
powerful
that
they
have
obtained
a
special
state
constitutional
exemption
from
property
tax
limitations
applicable
to
every
other
governmental
entity
including
the
state
itself
save
one.
in
summary,
washington's
gross
receipt
tax
here
at
issue,
does
not
tax
imports
or
exports
at
all.
in
fact
a
large
proportion
of
the
imports
and
exports
passing
through
the
state
are
not
even
affected
by
the
tax
because
they
do
not
require
stevedoring
services.
the
taxes
levied
on
the
handling
of
goods
only
and
not
on
the
goods
themselves.
those
services
are
performed
entirely
within
the
state
and
the
tax
is
thus
precisely
apportioned.
the
does
not
discriminate
against
inter-state
or
foreign
commerce
and
is
fairly
related
to
governmental
services
provided
by
the
state.
as
walter
helistien
(ph)
says
in
his
masterful
michigan
law
review
article
of
last
june
on
complete
auto
transit
and
michelin
tire
and
i
quote
”in
each
case
this
court's
opinion
can
fairly
be
read
as
stressing
a
common
doctrinal
theme.
so
long
as
the
state
does
not
discriminate
against
our
importer's
burden
upon
the
constitutionally
protected
interest,
the
tax
will
be
sustained.”
perhaps
the
sole
serious
aberrations
from
this
theme
are
puget
sound,
stevedoring
and
carter
&
weekes.
we
submit
that
it
is
time
to
put
them
to
rest.
mr.
slade
gorton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
you
asked
mr.
piper
to
distinguish
the
tax
in
canton
railroad
from
the
one
which
the
state
proposes
to
and
holds
here
and
the
answer
was
simply
that
wharfage
was
collateral
or
peripheral,
i
believe
were
the
words
used.
there
was
no
direct
answer
to
the
question.
the
services
in
canton
railroad
and
even
more
graphically
in
western
maryland
railway
which
was
a
companion
decision
in
the
early
1950s
were
clearly
beyond
peradventure
of
doubt,
taxes
on
transportation
on
the
service
of
transportation
and
they
were
upheld
against
charges
that
they
violated
the
import
and
export
clause
because
as
we
have
already
discussed
while
the
import
export
clause
is
peremptory
is
an
absolute
bar,
it
is
a
very
narrow
absolute
bar.
mr.
piper
keeps
speaking
of
its
application
to
taxes,
yet
does
not
mentioned
taxes.
it
speaks
of
imposts
or
duties
on
imports
or
exports.
mr.
slade
gorton
there
the
tax
was
on
the
sale
and
there
in
the
early
days,
before
this
court
used
the
commerce
clause
and
they
built
up
doctrines
of
discrimination
and
the
like,
that
tax
was
determined
to
be
a
tax
against
imports
because
it
was
discriminatory.
the
only
sellers
who
had
to
pay
the
tax
in
brown
versus
maryland
were
sellers
of
imports.
the
competing
seller
of
local
goods
was
not
charged
with
those
at
all.
the
tax
in
import
in
other
words
as
an
import
not
as
one
of
the
goods
that
were
commonly
located
in
the
state.
mr.
slade
gorton
no,
any,
no
not
any
tax.
mr.
slade
gorton
any
imposed
or
duty
which
is
a
--
mr.
slade
gorton
on
imports
or
exports
--
mr.
slade
gorton
whether
it
discriminates
--
mr.
slade
gorton
precisely,
the
rules
on
discrimination
and
apportionment
do
not
apply
if
you
have
an
impost
or
duty
against
an
import
or
export,
but
as
you
have
pointed
out
most
recently
in
michelin
that
language
imposts
and
duties
is
much
more
narrow
than
the
language
impost,
duties,
excises
and
taxes.
mr.
slade
gorton
a
non
discriminatory
impost
or
duty;
perhaps
a
non
discriminatory
impost
or
duty
which
would
be
one
which
was
matched
--
mr.
slade
gorton
oh!
no,
no.
mr.
slade
gorton
the
example
which
i
gave
you
earlier
this
morning,
the
tax
on
widgets.
the
state
of
washington
imposes
a
manufacturing
tax
on
widgets
and
a
compensating
tax
on
widgets
from
japan.
i
do
not
believe
that
to
be
non
discriminatory
because
all
widgets
are
subject
to
the
same
tax,
but
it
would
clearly
be
an
impost
or
a
duty
on
an
import
or
an
export,
and
therefore,
would
be
invalid
--
mr.
slade
gorton
no
not
if
he
sells
out
of
state.
mr.
slade
gorton
in
state
he
does,
but
he
pays
the
tax
on
the
sale
and
because
under
those
circumstances
the
domestic
producer
pays
the
same
tax
on
sale
and
--
mr.
slade
gorton
yes,
you
do
pay
goods
receipt
tax.
if,
however,
you
sell
those
goods
in
other
states,
you
do
not
pay
the
goods
receipt
tax
--
mr.
slade
gorton
that
is
because
of
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
slade
gorton
your
one
doctrine
separates
the
sales
type
situation,
the
tax
on
sales
from
the
tax
--
mr.
slade
gorton
in
effect
under
another
clause,
you
say
the
only
state
which
can
tax
the
sale
is
the
destination
state
and
that
of
course
is
the
rationale
ground
of
richfield
and
the
like,
but
unless
--
mr.
slade
gorton
to
tax
the
importers,
local
sale
as
long
as
–
no
it
is
not.
mr.
slade
gorton
no
excuse
me,
it
would
not
be
his
foreign
sale.
mr.
slade
gorton
it
would
be
because
that
was
a
tax
by
the
origin,
the
state
of
origin
which
you
simply
do
not
permit
to
tax
sales,
but
in
this
case
of
course
we
are
not
taxing
goods
at
all,
that
is
why
it
is
an
easier
case
--
mr.
slade
gorton
i
would
say
that
that
would
be
a
tax
directly
on
the
goods.
that
would
undoubtedly
be
the
brown
v.
maryland
situation
since
you
had
effected
them
with
--
that
would
be
an
effect
on
the
tax
--
mr.
slade
gorton
because
that
tax
would
have
no
relationship
to
the
services
provided
within
the
state,
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
goods
were
unloaded,
it
would
not
how
they
were
under
those
circumstances.
in
this
case,
we
are
dealing,
the
tax
is
on
the
handling
of
the
goods
themselves.
these
employers
have
already
been
found
to
the
subject
to
such
a
tax
if
all
they
do
is
supply
the
stevedores
to
the
shipping
company
itself
even
if
as
far
back
as
puget
sound
stevedoring,
that
is
really
a
distinction
without
a
difference.
in
this
case,
we
do
not
direct
our
tax
against
the
goods
at
all.
how
many
goods
there
are?
what
goods
there
are?
what
they
are
worth
is
all
irrelevant.
mr.
slade
gorton
yes
but
the
we
are
not
taxing,
for
example,
the
fact
that
the
arco
tanker
unloads
goods
without
using
any
services
within
the
state.
when
it
unloads
its
petroleum
at
an
in
state
refinery,
it
is
not
subject
to
this
tax
because
no
service
is
occurring
within
the
state.
we
are
taxing
a
service.
we
are
not
taxing
interstate
commerce
for
that
matter
and
in
this
case
as
directly
at
all.
we
are
taxing
solely
a
service
which
is
entirely
performed
within
the
state
of
washington
from
beginning
to
the
end
of
that
service.
mr.
slade
gorton
yes,
that
is
right.
mr.
slade
gorton
well,
generally
speaking
it
lands
on
the
dock
and
it
is
then
transferred
to
--
mr.
slade
gorton
but
let
us
say
that
it
does
that,
mr.
justice
marshall,
we
are
still
--
mr.
slade
gorton
exactly
the
same
thing.
if
that
service
of
unloading
were
engaged
in
washington,
this
is
what
you
decided
in
canton
railroad.
you
looked
to
the
import
export
clause
--
you
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
looked
to
the
import
export
clause
and
said
now
this
clause
may
have
a
great
breadth
when
the
tax
is
on
the
imports
or
exports
themselves,
at
that
time
you
might
very
well
have
extended
it
as
far
as
michelin
tire.
in
any
event,
you
extended
it
until
the
imports
were
out
of
their
original
packages
wherever
they
eventually
left,
but
even
back
in
the
1950
in
canton
railroad,
you
said
the
clause
is
much
narrower
when
it
is
applied
to
services
related
to
goods,
specifically
in
that
case
to
handling
services.
those
handling
services
were
an
integral
part
of
the
transportation
of
the
goods,
absolutely
integral.
they
could
not,
the
imports
could
not
get
into
the
united
states
without
getting
off
those
ships
and
without
being
transported
to
the
truck
line
and
railroads
and
then
the
western
maryland
transported
by
the
rails,
could
not
have
done
it
at
all,
nonetheless
you
said
it
does
not
apply.
why
did
it
not
apply
because
it
was
not
a
tax
against
the
goods
or
services.
