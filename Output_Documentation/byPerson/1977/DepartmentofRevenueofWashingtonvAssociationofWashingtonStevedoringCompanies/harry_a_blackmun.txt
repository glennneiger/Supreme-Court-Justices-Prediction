other
question
and
i
will
stop,
as
i
understand
the

power
here
was

and
i
take
it,
in
any
event
your
opposition
raises
no
question
about
the
fact
that
was
raised
by
or
applied
by
a
revenue
ruling
as
distinguished
from
something
else?

(voice

justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
this
case
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington.
therefore
the
second
time
in
this
century,
washington
seeks
to
apply
at
its
business
and
occupation
tax
to
stevedoring.
the
first
application
of
that
tax
back
in
the
thirties
was
unsuccessful.
in
a
case
called
puget
sound
stevedoring
company
against
the
state
tax
commission,
this
court
held
that
the
tax
was
unconstitutional
as
violative
of
the
commerce
clause
of
the
federal
constitution.
the
state
now
has
reimposed
the
tax
and
rephrased
the
question
on
a
double
front,
whether
the
second
attempt
violates
either
the
commerce
clause
or
the
import-export
clause
of
the
federal
constitution.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
hold
that
washington’s
business
and
occupation
tax
does
not
violate
the
commerce
clause
by
taxing
the
interstate
commerce
activity
of
the
stevedoring
that
takes
place
within
the
state.
this
result
we
feel,
was
foretold
by
a
case
last
term
called
complete
auto
transit
against
brady.
a
state
under
appropriate
conditions
may
tax
the
privilege
of
conducting
interstate
business
and
the
commerce
clause
balance
--
tips
against
the
state,
only
when
it's
a
tax
unfairly
burdens
commerce
by
exacting
from
the
interstate
activity
more
than
it's
just
share
of
the
cost
of
state
government.
we
hold
that
this
tax
meets
the
conditions
imposed.
as
a
consequence,
the
court’s
earlier
decisions
in
the
puget
sound
case
and
one
in
1947
called
joseph
against
carter
&
weeks
stevedoring
company,
are
therefore
overruled.
the
second
attack
upon
the
washington
tax
rests
on
the
import
export
clause.
that
clause
states
that
no
state
without
the
consent
of
congress,
shall
lay
any
imposed
or
duty
on
imports
or
exports.
we
hold
that
the
washington
tax
as
applied
to
stevedoring,
so
as
to
reach
services
provided
wholly
within
the
state
of
washington
to
imports
and
exports
and
other
goods,
is
not
among
the
imports
or
duties
prohibited
by
the
import-export
clause.
the
tax
does
not
threaten
any
of
the
policies
behind
the
clause
that
would
lead
to
precluding,
well,
namely
the
preclusion
of
state
disruption
of
foreign
policy
or
of
protecting
revenues,
or
of
avoiding
friction
on
trade
barriers
among
the
states.
this
tax
does
not
fall
on
the
goods
themselves
but
only
on
the
business
of
loading
and
unloading
ships
and
it
does
not
constitute
the
imposition
of
a
transit
fee
upon
inland
customers.
as
a
consequence,
the
decision
of
the
washington
supreme
court
to
the
contrary
is
reversed
the
and
the
case
is
remanded.
in
fairness,
we
note
that
the
supreme
court
of
washington
felt
itself
bound
by
our
prior
decisions
to
the
contrary
under
the
commerce
clause
decisions
that
today
are
overruled.
i
am
authorized
to
say
that
mr.
justice
powell
has
filed
a
separate
opinion,
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
result.
