could
a
tax
violate
the
export-import
clause
without
violating
the
commerce
clause?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
your
theory,
the
coastal
states,
whether
east
coast,
west
coast
or
gulf
coast
would
always
have
some
taxing
advantages
that
the
inland
states
would
not
have,
i
take
it
simply
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
stevedoring
activities
are
conducted
in
those
states
and
not
in
other
states?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
is
accepted
to
the
extent
the
tool
gate
mentality
that
your
opponents
mentioned
and
you
criticized
yesterday,
does
seem
to
have
been
on
the
minds
of
the
framers,
whereas
the
taxation
of
oranges
and
coal
mines
does
not
seem
to
have
been?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
with
no
kind
of
shipment,
no
staff,
in
the
state
of
washington
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
not
as
a
practical
matter
though
pretty
much
moot
because
your
destination
state
is
going
to
impose
a
use
tax
and
so
the
â€“
they
will
be
able
to
show
that
there
is
in
fact
double
taxation
if
washington
as
well
as
say
minnesota
are
the
state
of
destination
taxes?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
is
not
your
typical
tax
that
you
are
imposing
here
is
imposed
on
the
privilege
of
doing
business
and
then
measured
at
a
certain
percentages,
is
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
brown
against
maryland,
there
the
tax
was
on
the
sale,
was
it
not?
