mr.
john
t.
piper
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
respondents
are
stevedoring
companies
of
the
state
of
washington
and
also
the
washington
public
ports
association
to
that
extent
by
their
participation,
we
have
one
segment
of
the
public
contesting
with
another.
the
respondents
by
the
record
load
and
unload
ships
between
the
first
in-point
and
the
last
point
rest
on
the
pier
or
dock
and
the
ship's
hold.
we
are
here
to
defend
as
you
know
the
validity
of
two
of
your
decisions,
the
puget
sound
case
decided
in
1937,
the
carter
&
weekes
decided
ten
years
later
in
1947,
and
we
invoke
two
clauses
of
the
constitution,
commonly
called
the
import-export
clause
and
the
commerce
clause.we
see
the
clauses
as
a
different
in
force
and
in
effect.
until
this
morning
it
was
our
impression
from
the
briefs
of
the
state
that
they
saw
the
clauses
as
imposing
substantially
the
same
prohibitions
on
the
commerce;
namely
if
your
tax
is
okay,
if
it
does
not
discriminate
and
if
it
apportions.
we
hear
today
that
the
commerce
or
the
import-export
clause
does
have
more
force.
i
must
admit
that
i
did
not
catch
the
exact
point
on
which
it
had
more
force,
but
we
will
of
course
say
it
does
not,
we
will
try
to
be
specific
as
to
the
additional
force
we
think
it
has
over
the
implied
prohibition
of
the
commerce
clause.
we
start
therefore,
with
our
what
might
be
our
best
foot
forward,
the
import-export
clause
which
does
contain
an
express
prohibition.
our
thesis
under
the
import-export
clause
is
this.
that
the
expressed
prohibition
which
in
paraphrase
says
that
no
state
shall
levy
duties
on
imports
and
exports,
does
cover
in
a
literal,
plain
meaning
sense
loading
and
unloading
because
we
suggest
two
reasons.
loading
and
unloading
is
in
a
functional
sense
right
at
the
heart
of
the
import-export
process.
we
also
invoke
we
think
a
kind
of
approach
suggested
by
this
court
in
michelin
where
michelin
pointed
out
that
the
tax
there,
a
tax
on
the
mass
of
goods
and
the
property
in
the
state
after
they
had
come
to
rest
was
avoidable
by
the
importer.
we
say
here
that
on
analysis
we
think
anyone
would
come
to
the
conclusion
that
a
tax
fastened
on
the
loading,
on
the
unloading
would
not
be
avoidable
by
the
importer-exporter.
that
if
the
state
were
given
power
over
that
link
in
the
process,
they
would
have
effectively
power
over
the
process
as
a
whole.
mr.
john
t.
piper
the
wharfage
kind
of
case,
cases
like
that
have
been
regarded
as
collateral
of
the
things
that
seem
to
be
supplemental
or
an
aid
to
the
process,
not
integral
to
it,
have
been
treated
traditionally
as
collateral.
i
am
not
sure
that
i
would
say
that
it
could
have
been
decided
otherwise,
but
that
is
the
law.
mr.
john
t.
piper
as
we
read
your
cases,
this
court
seems
to
have
focussed
on
the
essential
import
process
bringing
the
goods
in,
getting
them
sold
and
the
things
that
are
peripheral
in
aid
of
as
a
matter
of
first
impression
perhaps
they
might
have
been
protected,
but
they
have
not
been.
mr.
john
t.
piper
that
is
correct.
i
think
the
only
answer
i
can
give
is
that
there
has
been
a
very
bare
bones
kind
of
protection.
it
does
not
include
such
things
as
a
wharfage,
cranes,
for
renting
cranes.
in
the
stevedore
case
for
example,
among
the
activities
that
the
stevedoring
company
did
was
to
make
longshoreman
available
by
hire.
that
was
not
protected,
although
it
was
in
aid
of
the
process.
so
it
is
a
hardcore
line
and
i
guess
what
we
are
saying
here
is
that
even
a
strictest
definition
would
find
the
landing
of
the
goods
essential
to
import
indeed
the
loading
of
the
goods
essential
to
the
exporting.
there
is
a
negative
side
to
our
thesis
that
we
may
to
deal
with
also,
the
state
it
seems
to
us
on
brief
at
least,
has
attempted
or
suggested
that
they
would
graft
on
to
the
clause,
a
kind
of
implied
limitation
which
would
be
to
the
effect
that
it
was,
a
tax
is
alright
if
does
not
discriminate
and
it
is
apportioned.
we
would
resist
that
for
reasons
that
i
will
state.
we
are
not
of
course
sure
just
how
strongly
they
about
that
limitation
after
this
morning,
but
we
will
deal
with
anyway.
returning
to
why
we
feel
that
were
covered
by
the
express
language,
the
language
that
is
actually
there
in
the
clause,
i
turn
again
to
the
functional
idea.
if
importing
is
bringing
things
into
the
country
what
can
be
more
central
to
that
than
putting
them
on
the
land.
this
court
in
brown
v.
maryland
in
fact
expressly
said
that
a
tax
could
be
as
effective
to
control
importing
and
exporting
if
it
is
attached
at
the
instant
of
landing,
as
if
it
is
attached
out
of
the
entry
at
the
harbor.
going
in
the
other
direction,
what
could
be
more
central
to
getting
the
goods
out
of
the
country
exporting
then
getting
them
aboard
the
ship.
another
test
as
i
have
suggested
came
out
of
your
decision
we
think
in
michelin.
there
you
pointed
out
that
the
tax
there
could
have
been
avoided
by
the
importer
just
by
keeping
the
goods
moving.
now,
the
implication
of
that
reasoning
it
seems
to
us
is
if
the
functional
that
is
involved
here
is
so
fundamental
to
the
process
that
the
importer
can
not
avoid
it.
it
is
part
of
the
process.
in
another
words,
if
you
give
the
state
a
power
over
this
link
in
the
chain,
he
has
power
over
the
whole
process.
the
brown
v.
maryland
case
is
instructive
there,
that
was
the
one
that
this
court
relied
on
principally
in
michelin.
there
the
tax
was
a
license
to
sell
and
this
court
reasoned
that
without
the
ability
to
sell
the
product,
the
active
importing
was
useless.
so
that
by
fastening
on
the
ability
to
sell,
they
effectively
taxed
the
process
itself.
the
omni
case
we
have
cited
on
brief
is
another
example.
there,
there
was
a
tax
not
on
the
importer,
but
on
the
carrier
or
more
precisely
on
the
carriers
in
bill
of
lading
and
this
court
took
notice
of
the
fact
that
a
bill
of
lading
is
really
essential
to
commerce.
therefore,
if
you
fasten
on
that
bill
of
lading
you
have
fastened
on
the
process
itself.
in
short
what
we
are
saying
is
that
we
come
under
the
literal
express
language
of
the
clause
as
written
that
if
you
give
the
power,
give
the
state
the
power
to
tax,
this
link
in
the
process
they
can
effectively
tax
the
process.
now,
i
come
to
their,
what
i
would
call
to
say
the
negative
part
of
our
thesis
under
this
clause
is
there
an
implied
limitation
in
the
clause,
that
says
in
effect
no
state
shall
levy
duty
on
imports
except
that
the
state
may
do
so
if
the
tax
is
unapportioned
and
non
discriminatory.
the
clause
as
you
know
has
one
express
exception.
a
state
may
tax
in
order
to
enforce
or
execute
its
inspection
laws,
but
there
is
an
imperative
in
that
exception.
it
says,
it
may
tax
to
the
extent
absolutely
necessary.
so
we
are
faced
then
with
just
one
exception
that
is
express
and
a
rather
stringently
restricted
exception
at
that.
may
you
graft
on,
should
this
court
graft
on
to
the
express
clause,
an
implied
limitation
that
a
tax
is
okay
if
it
is
unapportioned
and
non
discriminatory.
now,
despite
counsel's
statement
this
morning
that
the
import-export
clause
does
have
more
force,
we
have
not
in
our
minds
at
least
detected,
what
force
it
would
have
beyond
approving
the
taxes
that
are
non
discriminatory
and
apportioned.
certainly
there
is
no
suggestion
in
their
brief
as
to
just
why
a
tax
would
be
struck
down
if
it
could
meet
those
two
requirements.
we
give
you
three
exceptions
that
we
take
to
the
idea
that
there
is
some
limitation
here
in
the
nature
of
taxes
are
okay
if
they
are
non
discriminatory
and
apportioned.
your
decision
in
richfield
has
dealt
with
this
question
at
length,
very
carefully
taken
into
account
the
history
of
the
constitution,
the
standards
by
which
the
constitution
should
be
expounded,
i
m
not
going
to
repeat
it
because
we
dealt
with
it
at
length
in
our
brief
at
pages
11
and
12.
i
want
to
go
to
my
second
exception
to
the
idea
that
we
can
impliedly
limit
this
clause
to
the
purposes
of
the
clause.
counsel
yesterday
stated
correctly
that
this
court
in
michelin
identified
three
purposes
of
the
clause.
one
of
the
purposes
we
discussed
on
brief
which
is
the
prevention
of
the
transit
fee.
michelin
said
that
the
clause
was
fashioned
to
prevent
transit
fees
and
the
experience
under
the
articles
of
the
confederation
had
taught
that
seaboard
states
were
inclined
to
fasten
on
these
transit
fees
on
goods
flowing
to
the
inland
states.
throughout
the
decision
in
michelin,
there
are
repeated
careful
distinctions
of
the
transit
situation
from
the
tax
on
the
mass
of
the
property
involved
there.
for
example,
the
holding
of
this
court
in
michelin,
stated
in
the
last
paragraph
of
the
opinion
begins,
petitioner's
tires
in
this
case
were
no
longer
in
transit.
there
is
at
page
290
of
the
michelin
opinion
a
statement
or
i
think
a
very
suggestion,
i
am
going
to
put
it
that
way,
that
even
a
non
discriminatory
property
tax
might
have
to
exclude
or
would
have
to
exclude
goods
in
transit.
so
we
think
that
the
transit
idea
has
been
carefully
set
aside
and
preserved
in
the
michelin
decision.
now,
the
state
wants
to
do
exactly
what
that
purpose
was
intended
to
prevent.
they
want
to
have
a
transit
fee,
now
to
be
sure
it
is
a
sanitized
transit
fee
because
it
is
non
discriminatory
and
apportioned,
but
it
is
a
transit
fee
nonetheless.
it
enlarges
their
tax
base
by
the
increased
volume
of
traffic
at
the
expense
of
the
inland
states.
i
address
myself
now
to
the
other
two
purposes
that
you
identified
in
michelin
that
underly
this
clause.
we
did
not
address
them
as
counsel
correctly
pointed
out
on
brief,
but
i
do
now.
the
federal
government
wished
to
avoid
having
the
states
share
with
it
the
revenues
and
the
power
of
regulation
over
foreign
commerce,
and
we
say
that
the
state's
brief
asserts
the
power
to
do
exactly
that.
they
say
at
page
32
in
a
title,
a
state
may
consistent
with
the
import-export
clause
impose
a
tax
on
the
act
or
privilege
of
engaging
in
the
business
of
transporting
goods,
moving
in
foreign
commerce.
now,
that
business
would
include
the
business
of
the
foreign
carriers
themselves.
stevedoring
or
loading
and
unloading
is
the
issue
here,
but
the
business
of
transporting
goods,
moving
in
foreign
commerce,
that
is
a
business
that
the
foreign
carriers
are
engaged
in.
suppose
for
example
that
they
asserted
that
tax
and
the
foreign
carriers
perhaps
not
being
accustomed
to
that
treatment,
resisted
payment.
(inaudible)
collection
officers
presumably
would
take
the
most
practical
means
of
collection
mainly
seizing
the
ship.
that
would
have
i
think
some
impact
on
foreign
relations.
again,
on
the
regulation
point,
if
the
power
to
tax
is
the
power
to
regulate,
this
court
has
as
we
pointed
on
on
brief,
previously
said
that
our
state,
which
is
the
dairy
state
may
tax
all
your
margin,
this
was
in
1930s,
without
violating
the
rules
against
discrimination,
which
are
very
loose,
we
say
rather
feeble
rules.
well,
why
could
not
they,
if
they
were
granted
the
power
they
ask
here
to
tax
handling
or
tax
loading
and
unloading,
why
could
not
they
discriminate
between
what
is
being
unloaded
and
loaded
like
discriminate
against
olio,
against
south
american
beef.
why
could
not
they
in
other
words
use
a
power
to
tax
loading
and
unloading
to
erect
their
own
tariffs.
now,
this
is
speculation.
i
guess
the
point
we
would
say
is
that
the
speculation
or
the
concerns
expressed
here
were
considered
by
the
framers
of
the
constitution
and
it
is
not
we
suggest
appropriate
for
them
to
be
second
guessed.
those
are
the
purposes
that
the
framers
thought
merited
this
expressed
prohibition
and
we
suggest
that
they
should
be
accepted
and
the
language
should
be
applied
as
it
was
written.
i
come
to
the
last
reason
why
we
accepted
the
idea
that
there
is
some
implied
limitation
here
and
it
comes
back
again
to
the
idea
that
we
think
there
surely
must
be
more
force
in
an
expressed
clause
than
in
an
implied
one,
and
therefore,
whatever
you
may
decide
is
the
rule
in
the
commerce
clause
and
we
of
course
assert
that
the
commerce
clause
has
a
stronger
prohibition
than
the
state
does,
but
whatever
you
may
decide
surely
there
is
some
additional
strength
or
force
in
effect
in
the
import-export
clause
than
you
would
find
in
the
commerce
clause.
in
connection
with
this
question
about
the
greater
force
of
the
import-export
clause,
let
me
mention
the
canton
railroad
case
discussed
by
counsel
yesterday
as
being
the
case
in
which
impliedly
overruled
the
stevedoring
cases.
that
was
a
case
written
by
mr.
justice
douglas.
now,
the
language
of
that
opinion
and
its
companion
did
in
fact
consisted
the
word
'handling,'
but
if
you
look
at
the
facts
carefully,
a
handling
covers
things
that
are
(inaudible)
loading
and
unloading.
it
covered
storage,
wharfage,
weighing
of
loaded
freight
cars,
furnishing
a
crane,
these
are
the
peripheral
sort
of
things
mr.
chief
justice
that
as
i
said
in
tradition
just
have
not
received
the
protection,
apparently
not
being
close
enough
to
the
core,
this
was
in
fact
a
distinction
made
in
the
first
stevedore
case.
perhaps
the
closest
thing
to
transportation
there
was
switching
of
cars
from
one
point
in
baltimore,
that
is
from
the
piers
to
the
trunk
line
of
railroads.
mr.
justice
douglas
said,
that
was
more
remote
than
stevedoring
and
he
distinguished
the
stevedoring
case.
at
least
you
think
that,
that
was
a
mere
perfunctory
distinguishment
that
mr.
justice
douglas
made,
i
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
mr.
justice
douglas
participated
in
the
second
stevedore
case
in
1946,
just
four
years
before
canton.
and
there
he
voted
to
strike,
to
sustain
the
tax
under
the
commerce
clause,
but
under
the
import-export
clause
he
switched
over
to
the
majority
and
was
joined
by
one
other
justice,
so
there
was
a
7-2
decision
there.
and
he
said
to
him,
the
express
prohibition
of
the
import-export
clause
made
the
difference
and
again
it
was
mr.
justice
douglas
who
wrote
the
richfield
opinion
which
said,
lack
of
discrimination
is
not
enough
to
save
a
tax
that
applies
to
import-exports.
i
turn
now
to
my
--
mr.
john
t.
piper
yes,
i
believe
it
is
and
if
we
had
nothing
more
to
go
on,
i
would
say
that
it
would
be
fair
to
imply
that
perhaps
he
has
some
doubt
in
his
mind
because
we
need
not
decide
a
sort
of
language
and
that
is
why
i
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
just
four
years
before
--
mr.
john
t.
piper
yes.
mr.
john
t.
piper
it
overlaps
it.
it
is
from
point
of
rest,
last
point
of
rest
into
the
ship
from
the
hold
of
the
ship
back
to
first
point
of
rest,
that
language
is
not
precise.
i
think
the
distinction
that
he
makes
the
distinguishing
of
the
stevedore
cases,
you
just
have
to
take
as
adding
the
precision
that
the
language
itself
does
not
contain.
mr.
john
t.
piper
i
think
traditionally
with
some
real
economic
merit
of
course,
this
court
has
regarded
property
taxes,
net
income
taxes,
as
standing
on
somewhat
better
constitutional
ground
as
far
as
movement
in
commerce
is
concerned,
because
it
tends
to
attack
accumulated
wealth
and
it
tends
--
mr.
john
t.
piper
alright,
your
question
would
be
what
would
happen
if
you
attempted
to
--
mr.
john
t.
piper
i
am
actually
trying
to
recall
whether
a
decision
has
been
made
that
says
that
an
income
tax
is
valid.
mr.
john
t.
piper
if
i
had
to
predict
what
would
occur
and
the
rationale
behind
it,
i
would
probably
say
that
on
income
tax,
on
the
portion
of
the
net
income
that
might
be
traced
to
the
import
let
us
say,
would
probably
be
--
mr.
john
t.
piper
alright,
and
the
tracing
would
be
easy
in
that
case.
i
would
be
inclined
to
predict
a
sustaining
on
the
basis
of
the
history
where
income
taxes
and
property
taxes
have
been
considered
sufficiently
remote.
now,
conceptually
you
get
difficulties
in
justifying
this.
the
taxation
being
practical,
we
say,
well,
it
does
not
seem
to
have
the
same
impact
that
excises
do
and
we
justified
on
practical
grounds,
while
conceptually
we
do
get
into
difficulties,
very
much
like
the
--
mr.
john
t.
piper
on
the
importer?
mr.
john
t.
piper
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
t.
piper
yes.
mr.
john
t.
piper
your
decision
in
brown
v.
maryland
would
clearly
protect
the
importer.
if
by
that
you
mean
the
person
who
was
responsible
for
the
goods
having
them
brought
into
the
country.
he
was
--
mr.
john
t.
piper
that
is
correct
under
brown
v.
maryland.
that
importer
in
brown
v.
maryland
did
not
even
have
to
pay
the
tax
on
his
sale,
on
the
theory
that
by
taxing
his
sale,
you
ineffectively
made
it,
if
he
could
not
sell
his
importing
was
useless.
so
i
think
that,
that
decision
has
been
made
if
you
are
talking
about
the
fellow
who
brings
the
goods,
who
causes
the
goods
to
be
brought
into
the
country.
mr.
john
t.
piper
you
cannot
tax
him
let
us
say
at
the
point
of
manufacture
without
any
question.
i
turn
now
to
the
commerce
clause
which
as
we
have
said
is
an
implied
prohibition,
therefore
it
is
weaker.
it
leaves
large
areas
available
for
taxation.
for
example,
under
the
commerce
clause
the
interstate
sale
itself
is
taxable.
the
state
of
the
market
may
tax
it.
the
production
of
the
goods,
the
manufacture
or
extraction
of
the
goods
is
taxable.
a
good
deal
of
transportation
of
interstate
goods
is
taxable.
our
thesis
here
is
though
that
there
remains
and
should
remain
in
law
an
area
of
protection
of
transportation,
of
movement
in
commerce
and
i
propose
to
develop
that
thesis
and
draw
the
lines
referring
to
your
decisions
by
some
illustrations.
assume
first
a
journey
from
alaska
to
seattle
unloaded
let
us
say
by
stevedores
to
a
local
carrier
and
proceeding
from
seattle
to
a
inland
city
in
washington,
let
us
say
walla
walla,
your
decision
in
complete
auto
transit
permits
a
tax
on
the
carrier
that
handles
the
transit
from
the
port
of
seattle
to
walla
walla.
that
in
fact
is
not
a
new
rule
that
was
an
old
rule;
the
case
of
philadelphia
railroad
v.
night
which
was
distinguished
in
the
first
stevedore
case
involved
a
taxi
service
that
the
interstate
carrier
had
set
up
and
that
taxi
service
was
considered
local
transit.
so
that
may
be,
that
segment
of
the
carriage
of
the
interstate
goods
may
be
taxed.
going
the
other
direction
from
walla
walla
to
seattle
and
then
to
alaska,
your
decision
in
interstate
oil
would
allow
the
local
transit
from
walla
walla
to
the
port
of
seattle
to
be
taxed.
now,
we
come
to
the
area
where
we
say
there
should
be
some
protection.
assume
a
journey
from
alaska
through
washington
to
an
inland
state,
minnesota,
wisconsin,
illinois,
washington
under
the
stevedore
line
of
cases
--
mr.
john
t.
piper
we
will
assume
in
this
case
that
a
carrier
from
alaska
to
seattle
unloaded
by
stevedores
put
aboard
an
interstate
railroad
and
continuing
on
through,
we
would
say
no
tax
there
and
we
think
that
that
not
only
reconciles
your
decisions,
but
we
suggest
that
it
makes
good
economic
sense
to
emphasize
the
points
that
or
the
rationale
you
have
made
in
complete
auto
transit.
we
point
out
to
you
that
if
the
tax
on
the
incoming
goods,
say
from
seattle
to
walla
walla,
if
it
was
a
tax
there,
the
people
who
are
going
to
feel
it
are
the
consumers
in
walla
walla.
there
is
going
to
be
operating
the
normal
political
restraints
against
taxes.
likewise
if
the
goods
are
going
from
walla
walla
to
seattle,
the
people
that
are
going
to
feel
that
tax
are
the
producers
in
walla
walla
whose
goods
become
somewhat
less
competitive,
but
on
the
through
traffic,
there
really
is
not
any
political
restraint
and
we
have
suggested
to
you
that
the
rules
that
you
have
against
discrimination
just
are
not
quite
enough
and
they
just
allow
too
much
latitude.
for
example,
our
tax
i
should
think
could
be
increased
at
least
up
to
railroads
which
is
3.6
times
of
what
they
are
now.
so
we
commend
to
the
court
a
consideration
of
retaining
what
we
think
is
a
reconciliation
of
the
cases
on
their
holdings
to
protect
the
through
transit,
the
interstate
carrier,
which
would
include
stevedoring
on
my
hypothetical
because
you
do
not
have
the
political
restraints,
you
have
the
transit
fee
syndrome.
mr.
john
t.
piper
well,
excises
of
course
can
be
taxed
upon
any
number
of
different
acts.
now,
use
tax
would
imposed
on
the,
by
the
destination
state,
but
say
on
the
use
by
the
consumer
in
that
state,
but
it
would
not,
i
think,
i
am
suggesting
that
unless
we
are
able
to
sustain
the
authority
that
we
are
defending
here,
i
think
we
need
the
rule
that
be
through
states
may
not
tax.
i
do
not
think,
i
would
invoke
the
use
tax
as
a
rationale.
mr.
john
t.
piper
yes
it
is.
we
say
though
that
to
the
extent
that
it
fastens
on
to
movement
which
is
a
through
type
movement,
it
has
been
a
struck
down
and
should
be
because
we
see
no,
again
we
see
the
transit
fee
syndrome
there.
we
do
not
see
the
political
restraints
that
you
have
in
the
destination
state
or
in
the
origin
state.
we
pointed
out
on
brief
why
do
we
think
that
the
rule
against
discrimination
just
is
not
enough
of
a
safeguard
to
protect
against
the
transit
fee
syndrome.
now,
we
of
course
recognize
that
the
transit
fee
is
a
purpose
of
the
import
export
clause.
we
suggest
that
the
policy
behind
the
transit
fee
is
worthy
of
consideration
as
your
weigh,
as
you
are
allowed
to
do
under
the
commerce
clause,
the
various
interest
of
the
states
for
revenue
and
the
interest
of
let
us
say
a
common
market.
now,
we
think
that
this
protection
of
through
goods
against
the
transit
fee
is
a
good
common
market
concept.
we
in
our
state,
for
example,
are
making
a
distinction,
we
did
distinction
not
a
long
ago,
not
only
between
butter
and
oil
margin,
but
we
tax
billiards
and
pool
and
golf,
but
not,
we
did
not
tax
bowling.
if
you
were
for
a
while
in
our
state,
if
you
rolled
balls
along
the
grass
or
along
a
felt
surface
you
were
taxable,
but
if
you
rolled
them
on
a
wood
surface
you
were
not.
those
distinctions
are
permitted.
it
is
perfectly
good
law.
the
rules
against
discrimination
give
legislators
tremendous
latitude
and
they
are
just
not
an
adequate
safeguard
we
think
against
the
transit
fee
syndrome.
we
having
said
to
you
that
we
think
the
transit
fee
syndrome
is
worth
considering
as
you
allowed
to
do
under
the
commerce
clause
we
return
in
summary
to
say
under
the
import
export
clause
it
has
been
considered
and
the
framer
said,
“we
do
not
want
it.”
they
have
said,
“we
do
not
want
the
states
sharing
in
the
revenues
and
the
power
to
regulate
commerce.
that
we
think,
that
question
is
really
not
up
for
a
reconsideration.
it
has
been
settled
and
there
should
be
no
implied
limitation
grafted
onto
the
expressed
prohibition.
