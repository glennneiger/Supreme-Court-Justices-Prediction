justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
respondents
in
this
case
are
public
school
students
who
were
suspended
without
a
hearing.
they
sued
petitioners,
the
school
officials
seeking
damages
under
section
1983
of
title
42
of
the
united
states
code.
they
contend
that
the
denial
of
a
hearing
deprived
them
of
that
fourteenth
amendment
right
to
procedural
due
process.
the
district
court
agreed
that
there
was
a
denial
of
procedural
due
process,
but
refused
to
award
damages
because
respondents
had
proved
no
resulting
injury.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
reversed.
it
held
that
respondents
are
entitled
to
recover
substantial
damages
even
if
the
suspensions
were
justified
and
even
if
respondents
do
not
prove
any
injury
other
than
the
denial
of
a
hearing.
petitioners
do
not
contest
the
holding
of
a
constitutional
right
not
to
be
suspended
without
notice
of
hearing.
they
insist,
however,
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
it's
holding
of
entitlement
to
substantial
damages.
we
agree
with
petitioners
that
the
mere
denial
of
notice
and
hearing
without
more
cannot
be
the
basis
for
the
award
of
substantial
damages
in
absence
of
any
proof
of
injury.
we
make
clear
in
our
opinion
filed
today
that
compensable
injury
may
include
mental
and
emotional
distress
provided
a
claim
therefore
is
supported
by
competent
evidence.
as
there
was
no
such
evidence
in
this
case,
we
hold
that
respondents
are
not
entitled
to
recover
substantial
damages.
we
also
hold,
however,
that
even
where
denial
of
procedural
due
process
is
not
shown
to
have
caused
actual
injury,
the
plaintiff
is
entitled
to
recover
damages
not
to
exceed
$1.
accordingly,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
marshall
concurs
in
the
judgment.
mr.
justice
blackmun
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
