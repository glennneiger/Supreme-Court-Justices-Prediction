chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
1149
carey
and
others
against
piphus.
mr.
hoffenberg
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
as
you
are
telling
us
now
counsel
that
as
to
the
compensatory
damages
it
is
the
law
of
the
case
that
it
is
based
on
this
$65
since
a
day?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
procedural
constitutional
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
elson?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
you
are
going
beyond
the
damages
for
the
denial
of
the
hearing,
the
due
process
violation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
say
that
there
are
two
elements
of
damages
now
to
be
determined
one
for
the
denial
of
the
hearing
and
the
other
for
the
loss
of
the
schooling?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
test
that
out
a
little
bit
and
see
if
i
understand
you.
on
your
illustration
of
claim,
injury
and
damages
where
someone
walking
across
your
lawn,
as
the
plaintiffs
have
showed
merely
that
defendant
had
walked
across
his
lawn
and
no
more,
that
might
justify
a
jury
verdict
of
$1
or
$0.25
would
you
agree?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
it
went
very
much
beyond
that
do
you
think
without
any
other
evidence
would
you
think
it
would
be
sustainable?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
started
walking
across
the
grass.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no
showing
that
the
grass
was
injured
or
the
grass
died
or
anything
else?
just
walked
across
the
grass
and
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
of
$10,000,
what
would
you
think
that
appellate
court
would
do
on
review?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
addition
to
the
new
trial
that
is
ordered?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
took
your
answer
to
mean
whenever
a
new
trial
is
ordered
because
of
the
trial
error
that
in
addition
to
being
compensated
by
getting
a
new
trial
which
is
the
traditional
remedy
for
that
problem.
there
is
also
1983
claim
for
damages?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
thought
that
there
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
carey
against
piphus
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
powell.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
