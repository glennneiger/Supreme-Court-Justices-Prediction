justice
thurgood

mr.
hoffenberg,
am
i
right
you
did
not
raise
liability
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
did
not
contest
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
are
contesting
it
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
i
read
your
brief
i
thought
you
are?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
loss
is
there
by
not
been
permitted
to
wear
an
earing?
you
do
not
have
the
slightest
idea,
what
that
means
to
the
person,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
should
we
not
have
a
trial
and
found
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
would
that
not
show
up
on
his
trial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
man
has
a
right
to
wear
whatever
he
wants
to
wear?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
know
feel
that
he
has
if
you
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
about
the
tinker
case
of
about
the
armband,
was
it
(inaudible)
or
injured?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
am
just
saying
that
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
was
denied
the
right
to
wear
the
clothing
that
they
want
to
wear
or
the
jewelery
that
they
want
to
wear?
they
are
not
being
denied
something?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
why
we
have
all
the
discussions
about
general
and
punitive
and
all
other
kind
of
damages?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
your
answer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
is
what
i
was
trying
to
hear
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
before?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
elson
why
is
that
not
certain
that
a
20
day
suspension
is
damaging
where
you
have
denied
your
education
for
20
days
period?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
is
a
valid
point,
that
is
not
here--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
i
thought
he
said
$1?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
elson.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
record
would
show
that
there
are
several
cases
of
liable
per
se
with
$1
damages
that
had
been
upheld?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
know
one
in
particular
new
york
where
one
diamond
merchant
called
other
one
a
thief
and
he
sued,
and
the
jury
came
in
and
said
that
we
give
the
defendant
damage?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
when
the
judge
told
them
no
they
brought
him
$1?
