unknown
speaker
i
take
it
that
in
neither
the
district
court
nor
the
court
of
appeals,
was
there
any
finding
or
attention
given
to
whether
the
suspensions
were
justified?
unknown
speaker
i
just
want
to
know
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
district
court
did
not
address
the
question
or
make
any
findings
about
the
validity
of
the
suspensions?
unknown
speaker
and
on
remand
is
there
any
kind
of,
any
attention?
unknown
speaker
suppose
a
district
court
has
addressed
the
question
of
the
validity,
the
suspensions
that
had
found
that
the
students
were
properly
suspended,
how
would
that
change
your
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
just
asked
you
-
how
would
your
case
be
changed--?
unknown
speaker
if
the
district
court
had
found
the
suspensions
had
been
validly
imposed?
unknown
speaker
and
it
might
change
the
range
of
your
damages?
unknown
speaker
but
that
issue
will
be
opened
in
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
they
are
still
open?
unknown
speaker
on
constitutional
tort?
unknown
speaker
something
called
general
damages
was
known
to
the
common
law?
unknown
speaker
punitive
is
not
here
in
this
case
at
all?
unknown
speaker
then
we
have
special
and
general?
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
there
is
no
proof
of
any
special
damage
here?
unknown
speaker
perhaps
there
was
but
that
is
out
of
the
state
--
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
not
here
though?
unknown
speaker
and
the
concept
of
general
damages
was
familiar
to
the
common
law?
unknown
speaker
and
what
did
it
mean?
unknown
speaker
and
it
is
more
than
nominal.
i
mean
it
was
not
inevitably
limited
to
nominal?
unknown
speaker
and
you
have
to
first
prove
the
broken
arm,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
then
what
the
general
damages
mean
by
the
common
law?
unknown
speaker
money
award?
unknown
speaker
and
is
that
not
really
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
here?
unknown
speaker
mr.
hoffenberg,
would
this
case
be
different
if
the
issue
were
a
denial
of
either
--
let
me
give
you
one
example,
a
right
to
vote
or
secondly,
if
there
were
a
deprivation
of
the
right
to
be
free
in
a
legal
search
and
say
someone
in
search,
but
no
mental
suffering
in
either
case,
just
the
bear
injury
would
it
be
the
same
issue?
and
if
so
how
would
you
decide
those
cases?
unknown
speaker
in
a
voting
case,
how
would
you
ever
have
actual
damage?
unknown
speaker
and
what
difference
does
willfulness
make
if
you
are
not
doing
that
it
on
a
punitive
theory?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
hoffenberg,
may
be
i
misunderstood
this.
i
did
not
think
that
the
damage
here
was
the
denial
of
the
right
to
wear
the
earing
or
denial
of
the
privilege
of
smoking
on
the
other
hand?
unknown
speaker
but
rather
the
denial
of
procedural
due
process
--
unknown
speaker
and
even
if
that
had
been
accorded
he
might
have
been
deprived
of
his
right
to
wear
the
earing?
unknown
speaker
of
his
privilege
to
wear
the
earing?
unknown
speaker
the
denial
of
procedural
due
process?
unknown
speaker
there
is
nothing
to
do
with
the
--
unknown
speaker
deprivation,
well
not
of
privilege
of
wearing
the
earing?
unknown
speaker
or
the
deprivation
of
the
privilege
of
smoking
tobacco
or
marijuana
whatever
it
was?
unknown
speaker
the
wrong
is
a
deprivation
of
procedural
due
process.
unknown
speaker
mr.
hoffenberg,
if
i
could
interrupt,
this
argument
goes
to
the
procedural
due
process,
the
policy
above
there.
but
if
i
understand
your
earlier
statements,
the
same
problem
involved
is
raised
when
you
got
a
fourth
amendment
question
or
like
this
question
where
you
do
not
have
school
boards
at
all?
unknown
speaker
was
the
school
board
policy
cut
across
the
whole
spectrum
of
constitutional
rights?
unknown
speaker
but
if
this
case
comes
to
the
losses,
i
understand
what
you
have
earlier
said
that
there
was
a
violation
of
procedural
due
process
and
any
good
faith
defense
is
out
of
the
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
so
you
are
saying
there
was
a
knowing
violation
of
procedural
due
process
and
that
is
the
way
the
case
comes
to
us?
unknown
speaker
it
is
meant
or
not?
unknown
speaker
but
not
for
that?
unknown
speaker
not
for
a
knowing
violation?
unknown
speaker
that
is
in
the
district
court,
but
not
here.
unknown
speaker
mr.
elson
i
perhaps
should
not
interrupt
on
this
point,
but
you
say
it
is
clear
they
are
entitled
to
damages,
that
is
that
what
i
understand
it
is
clear
that
they
are
entitled
to
hearing
at
which
the
school
board
may
offer
evidence
that
they
would
have
been
suspended
even
had
they
been
given
a
fair
hearing
then
there
would
have
been
no
actual
damage?
unknown
speaker
and
then
your
client
will
recover
nothing
unless
you
prevail
on
the
theory
that
is
in
dispute
here?
unknown
speaker
which
is
what?
unknown
speaker
no,
what
is
your
theory
here?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
harm
i
mean
some
--
unknown
speaker
some
deprivation
of
--
unknown
speaker
some
tangible
loss?
unknown
speaker
what
about
hurt
your
feelings
that
is
not
the
kind
you
are
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
that
is
in
the
issue?
unknown
speaker
when
you
civil
rights,
do
you
mean
any
right
that
is
protected
by
the
constitution?
unknown
speaker
so
that
for
example,
in
violation
of
article
1,
a
state
official
laid
a
tax
or
duty
on
articles
exported
from
any
state?
unknown
speaker
and
why
do
you
limit
it
to
those?
unknown
speaker
but
why
do
you
presume
that
with
respect
to
this
particular
category
that
you
have
delineated
and
not
with
respect
to
the
rest
of
a
constitution?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
principle
that
enables
you
to
distinguish
one
from
the
other?
unknown
speaker
does
that
include
all
the
freedoms
protected
by
the
second
and
third
--?
unknown
speaker
and
eighth,
ninth,
tenth?
unknown
speaker
but
you
do
not
include
the
eighth?
unknown
speaker
so
they
include
some
of
the
rights
of
freedom
is
protected
by
the
bill
of
rights,
but
not
all
--
unknown
speaker
and
probably
not
any
of
the
other
protections
of
the
constitution
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
the
constitution
has
a
written
organic
structure
of
the
government
of
our
society
and
it
presumably
protects
us
all
--
unknown
speaker
in
everyone
of
its
provisions
and
how
are
you
picking
and
choosing
i
am
interested
in
it
--
unknown
speaker
and
how
are
you,
would
you
want,
would
you
not?
unknown
speaker
some
of
the
provisions
of
constitution,
but
not
all?
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
say
not
the
eighth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
denial
of
a
speedy
trial?
unknown
speaker
right
to
counsel
or
--?
unknown
speaker
but
what
about
say
denial
of
a
jury
trial,
the
claims
that
jury
trials
rights
being
violated
and
he
is
convicted,
he
appeals
and
it
is
reversed
that
saying
that
he
was
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
on
the
circumstances
of
the
case
and
then
he
brings
a
1983
act
and
recovers
damages?
unknown
speaker
does
he
not
have
a
tangible
loss
there
presumably
on
appeal
on
this
hypothesis,
a
new
trial
would
be
ordered
because
of
the
denial
and
you
have
one
tangible
measure
of
damages
namely
the
cost
of
the
first
irregular
trial,
whereas
he
could
show
that
he
spent
$4,000
in
attorneyâ€™s
fees
in
lost
11
days
of
work,
would
that
not
be
specific
damages
showable
under
the
special
damage
factor?
unknown
speaker
and
then
we
might
get
some
general
damages
for
the
intangible,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
elson,
may
i
ask
you
a
question.
i
may
have
trouble
articulating
this.
i
am
having
some
conceptional
difficulty
with
your
proposition.
the
right
here
to
a
fair
hearing
is
not
something
that
exists
all
by
itself,
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
due
process
period,
it
is
a
constitutional
right
not
to
be
deprived
of
liberty
or
property
without
due
process.
so
an
essential
ingredient
of
the
constitutional
violation
is
harm
to
either
liberty
or
property,
why
should
not
the
harm
to
the
liberty
or
property
interest
always
be
the
measure
of
damages
for
the
violation
of
the
due
process
right.
in
other
words,
why
will
not
your
injury
be
that
which
is
not
before
us
rather
than
which
is
before
us?
unknown
speaker
but
that
assumes
that
there
is
a
separate
right
to
a
hearing
apart
from
the
protection
against
some
injury?
unknown
speaker
but
why
should
that
not
measure,
if
the
magnitude
to
the
harm?
unknown
speaker
but
if
that
is
not
available
if
that
is
zero,
what
is
the
constitutional
violation?
if
that
is
zero
then
there
has
not
been
a
deprivation
of
liberty
or
property
without
due
process
of
law?
unknown
speaker
but
was
he
deprived
to
the
liberty
without
due
process
of
law?
unknown
speaker
i
still
do
not
see
why
if
that
is
true,
why
that
is
not
an
adequate
measure
of
his
damages?
unknown
speaker
well,
many
rights
are
not
necessarily
protected
by
the
award
of
monitory
damages,
they
are
protected
in
other
ways
-
there
are
trial
hours
of
constitutional
magnitude
are
protected
by
a
reversal,
by
a
reviewing
court
for
example
not
necessarily
by
the
award
of
money
damages,
not
every
right
is
compensable
when
that
is
protected
by
that
particular
sanction,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
just
because
of
immunity
of
a
particular
defendant
and
it
is
not
because
the
right,
and
(voice
overlap)
has
to
be
somewhere
and
for
the
loss?
unknown
speaker
and
whether
rights
are
to
be
indicted
before
you
could
be
charged,
before
it
would
be
tried
in
a
criminal
offense,
in
a
federal
court,
that
is
a
constitutional
right?
unknown
speaker
and
if
you
have
waived
it
then
you
have
a
right
of
action
if
you
have
been
tried
as
a
result
of
information
but
not
an
indictment.
unknown
speaker
for
monetary
damages?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
why
a
denial
of
a
fair
hearing
can
cause
harm,
i
am
not
questioning
that
proposition,
but
i
still
must
confess
to
some
uncertainty
about
your
response
of
the
five
year
jailer
case,
even
though
you
assume
that
if
the
jailer
holds
a
man
for
five
years
without
due
process
of
law,
i
would
suggest,
that
measures
the
value
of
five
years
imprisonment
is
the
measure
of
damages
for
that
deprivation
of
a
constitutional
right.
then
you
say,
well,
but
may
be
later
on
he
will
be
tried
and
convicted?
well,
that
still
does
not
seem
to
me
to
detract
from
the
proposition
that
the
major
of
the
harm
was
that
he
was
deprived
to
his
liberty
for
five
years
without
any
constitutional
protection
and
that
still
is
the
measure
of
the
damage
for
that
constitutional
right?
unknown
speaker
and
in
this
case
it
would
mean
the
8
or
12
days
or
whatever
the
children
were
out
of
school
would
be
the
measure
of
damages
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
protection
against
that
normally
is
the
judge
gets
immunity
and
there
are
all
sorts
of
defenses,
the
damages
are
not
awarded
automatically
in
these
cases?
unknown
speaker
but
let
me
put
this
case
to
you.
supposing
in
this
case,
they
brought
the
student
before
the
principal
and
had
some
summary
procedures
that
were
clearly
unfair,
they
quizzed
him
one
way
or
another,
but
then
they
did
not
suspend
him,
you
would
not
have
any
claim
then?
unknown
speaker
so
obviously
there
must
be
harm
in
the
sense
of
loss
of
property
or
liberty
before
the
deprivation
of
a
fair
hearing,
has
any
constitutional
significance?
unknown
speaker
well,
on
that
basis
if
it
is
determined
now
in
this
case
that
there
never
was
a
violation
in
the
sense
that
the
suspensions
were
proper?
there
was
no
deprivation
of
liberty.
unknown
speaker
if
that
is
determined
as
that
indicates
it?
unknown
speaker
no,
no
let
us
assume
on
remand
in
a
district
court,
it
is
determined
that
the
suspensions
were
quite
proper,
there
were
not
any
procedures
but
nevertheless
the
suspensions
were
quite
proper
--
unknown
speaker
in
that
event,
is
there
no
deprivation
of
a
liberty
and
there
has
been
no
deprivation
of
the
right
to
stay
in
the
school?
unknown
speaker
yes,
i
understand
that
you
were
deprived
of
your
chance
to
have
a
hearing?
unknown
speaker
and
you
think
that
is
compensable?
unknown
speaker
is
that
inconsistent
with
the
answer
you
gave
to
mr.
justice
stevens?
unknown
speaker
yes
alright,
possibly.
even
though
the
injury
to
the
liberty
is
zero,
the
right
to
stay
in
the
school,
the
thing
that
triggered
your
right
to
a
due
process
hearing,
even
if
it
is
determined
that
that
invasion
was
zero,
you
say
that
you
are
entitled
to
damages?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
plaintiff
in
a
civil
suit
is
cross-examined
on
stand
that
you
were
asking
about
his
damages,
did
it
hurt
your
feelings
or
you
ask
about
all
the
intangible
things
you
can
think
up
and
he
says
no,
i
do
not,
but
i
am
still
entitled
to
some
damages
because
i
think
you
want
to
be
deterred
from
violating
that
rights?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
would
have
up
to
zero
or
not?
unknown
speaker
so
you
do
espouse
openly
and
frankly
you
must
give
some
money,
some
substantial
award
to
deter?
unknown
speaker
then
your
intent
and
your
submission
is?
unknown
speaker
so
you
do
not
think
damages
are
limited
to
what
a
jury
or
judge
might
think
the
intangible
injuries
to
the
plaintiff
are
--?
unknown
speaker
as
you
said
they
are
limited
to
that?
unknown
speaker
yes,
well,
suppose,
the
other
case
whether
the
plaintiff
frankly
concedes
as
far
as
i
know
i
have
had
no
intangible
injury.
i
just
think
that
i
ought
to
have
damages
because
you
should
not
violate
my
rights
anymore.
unknown
speaker
yet
in
liable
per
se,
a
jury
can,
who
is
going
to
predict
for
$1?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
is
--
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
could
it
not
be
upheld
on
appeal
under
the
normal
rules
of
violation?
unknown
speaker
dollars
worth
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
the
(inaudible)
case
a
long
time
of
15-20
years
when
the
jury
as
i
recalled
return
a
verdict
of
$1
actual
damages
and
$75,000
punitive
damages?
unknown
speaker
mr.
elson,
in
this
very
case,
assuming
no
willful
misconduct
by
the
defendants
and
just
the
facts
that
you
have,
what
do
you
regard
as
the
dollar
value
of
the
damages
to
what
your
client
is
entitled?
unknown
speaker
yes,
what
are
we
you
going
to
ask
the
jury
to
give
you
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
have
requested
$5,000?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
then
did
complaint
of
propose
to
be
a
class
action
complaint
on
the
name
of
brisco?
unknown
speaker
no
class
was
certified,
but
does
that
mean
that
brisco
was
the
only
party
before
us?
unknown
speaker
so
you
have
asked
$5,000
for
one
and
$3,000
for
the
other?
unknown
speaker
but
what
is
the
difference?
unknown
speaker
but
those
damages
also
assume
some
injury
from
a
wrongful
suspension?
unknown
speaker
and
do
you
think
the
possibility
of
having
a
plaintiff
securing
attorneysâ€™
fees
would
not
be
enough
of
a
defendant?
unknown
speaker
you
are
not
claiming
that
this
deprivation
availed
in
your
complaint
was
a
result
of
malice
are
you?
unknown
speaker
right
the
district
court
found
no
malice.
