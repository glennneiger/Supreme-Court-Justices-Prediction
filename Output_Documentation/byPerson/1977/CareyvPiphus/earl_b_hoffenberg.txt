mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
today
for
determination
of
the
right
for
an
award
of
general
compensatory
damages
in
a
failure
to
provide
an
adequate
due
process
hearing
where
the
plaintiffs
neither
proved
any
individualized
injury
or
any
pecuniary
loss.
the
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
or
not
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
erred
when
it
determined
as
a
matter
of
law,
general
compensatory
damages
must
be
awarded
for
violation
of
the
civil
rights
absent
some
proof
of
individualized
injury
or
pecuniary
loss.
briefly,
the
record
reflects
the
following
facts.
we
have
a
consolidated
matter
before
the
court,
we
have
two
plaintiffs
mr.
silas
brisco
being
the
first.
mr.
brisco
was
a
student
chicago
public
school
system.
during
the
year
of
1972-73,
the
school
which
he
was
attending
was
changing
from
a
predominantly
white
school
to
that
of
the
black
school.
during
that
time,
the
school
officials
noted
that
there
were
some
gang
activity
in
the
school
in
around
the
area
and
some
gang
recruitment
and
had
occasion
to
observe
that
during
that
period,
wearing
of
an
earing
was
--
that
some
student
for
wearing
earings
during
that
period
of
time
and
decided
on
that
basis
after
conferring
with
two
or
three
of
the
school
officials
determined
that
it
was
necessary
in
the
interests
of
safety
to
ban
the
wearing
of
earings.
mr.
brisco
was
on
actual
notice
of
this
ban.
in
may
1973
mr.
brisco
was
observed
wearing
an
earing.
he
was
told
to
remove
it,
he
refused
to
remove
it.
his
mother
was
called
then,
after
extensive
conversation
with
the
district
superintendent,
mr.
brisco
removed
the
earing
and
no
further
incident
occurred.
in
september
1973,
when
school
reconvened
on
september
11,
mr.
brisco
again
wore
the
earing
to
school.
the
system
principal
and
the
principal
instructed
mr.
brisco
to
remove
the
earing,
he
denied.
he
refused
to
remove
the
earing.
mr.
brisco’s
mother
was
called.
she
came
in
and
she
supported
mr.
brisco’s
refusal
to
remove
the
earing
and
mr.
brisco
was
suspended
for
20
days
for
his
failure
to
remove
the
earing.
mr.
brisco
served
17
days
of
that
suspension
and
was
voluntarily
readmitted
pending
motion
for
preliminary
injunction
at
the
trial
district
court
level.
mr.
piphus
was
a
high
school
student
in
the
chicago
public
schools
and
on
january
23,
1974,
mr.
piphus
was
observed
that
on
school
premises
with
another
young
man,
outside
the
building,
but
on
the
school
premises
he
was
observed
by
the
principal
smoking
and
passing,
what
the
principal
characterizes
an
irregularly
shaped
cigarette.
as
the
principal
approached
he
had
occasion
to
observe
or
smell
an
odor
what
he
believed
to
be
marijuana.
as
he
approached,
the
cigarette
was
either
discarded
or
at
some
point
cigarette
was
discarded
as
he
was
taking
the
two
pupils
back
to
the
--
the
system
principal
was
the
disciplinary
at
the
school.
the
two
boys
denied
any
smoking
of
any
marijuana.
they
were
taken
back
the
principal
instructed
the
system
principal
to
follow
the
usual
procedures
of
the
20
day
suspension.
this
was
followed
and
mr.
piphus
was
suspended
along
with
the
other
young
man
for
20
days.
some
time
later
subsequent
to
the
district
superintendent
reduced
the
suspension
and
mr.
piphus
was
out
of
school
for
eight
days.
the
district
court
in
this
matter
sitting
as
a
triar
to
fact
on
the
stipulated
record,
determined
that
the
defendants
failed
to
provide
an
adequate
due
process
hearing,
because
he
determined
that
the
20
day
suspension
triggered
a
need
for
a
full
evidentiary
hearing.
he
further
found
that
there
was
no
good
faith
defense
available
to
the
defendants.
although
he
did
observe
that
wood
v.
strickland,
in
which
this
court
determined
and
qualified
immunity
to
the
board
members
and
board
employees,
he
did
observe
that
we
do
not
have
to
predict
the
future
to
constitutional
law
and
since
this
case
arose
prior
to
wood
v.
strickland,
he
said
that
necessarily
would
not
apply
but
the
doctrine
of
linwood
v.
peoria,
seventh
circuit
case
which
said
that
anything
over
seven
days
may
trigger
a
need
for
a
full
evidentiary
hearing.
he
said,
based
upon
that
rationale
the
board
would
not
be
able
to
have
a
good
faith
defense
and
if
that
was
unavailable
to
the
board.
although
he
did
observe
that
this
was
not
--
that
obviously
the
educators
were
trying
to
or
were
upholding
the
integrity
of
this
educational
process.
he
further
found
that
although
they
were
entitled
to
damages
for
the
violation
of
the
deprivation
of
an
adequate
due
process
hearing,
there
was
no
proof
of
any
evidence
submitted
nor
any
evidence
which
would
even
lead
to
a
speculative
inference,
to
form
any
major
of
the
damages
and
therefore
he
allowed
no
damages
and
the
case
was
dismissed.
the
case
went
up
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
there
was
a
motion
for
reconsideration
filed,
on
the
issue
of
damages.
the
issue
of
damage
was
reopened
and
during
dependency
of
the
motion
for
reconsideration,
the
district
court
judge
passed
away.
it
was
assigned
to
another
district
court
judge
after
considering
the
matter
to
the
other
district
court
judge
determined
that
the
motion
must
be
denied
in
the
issue
of
damages
and
he
stated
the
same
reasons.
basically
there
was
no
proof
of
any
damages
and
there
was
nothing
which
would
lead
to
any
speculative
inference
which
would
allow
measurement
as
to
the
extent
of
damages
so,
he
also
denied
the
motion.
the
case
went
up
to
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
on
the
issue
of
general
compensatory
damages
and
as
i
have
indicated
before
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeal
held
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
two
individuals
were
entitled
to
general
compensatory
damages
which
was
inherent
and
naturally
wrong
and
as
a
matter
of
law
and
the
measure
of
damages
were
not
so
small
to
trivialize
a
right
of
so
large
as
provided
windfall.
we
believe
that
this
--
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
no,
the
issue
of
liability
was
never
question
on
appeal.
the
main
issue
that
was
presented
on
appeal
was
the
issue
of
damages
and
--
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
no,
it
did
not,
it
did
not
reach
that
issue,
just
determined
that
we
have
violated
the
adequate
due
process.
and
on
--
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
well,
there
would
be
only
with
regard
to
this
court
on
remand
with
regard
to
special
damages,
we
did
not
petition.
the
only
regard
to
whether
or
not
the
suspensions
were
valid
would
be
on
remand
with
regard
to
the
issue
that
was
raised
in
the
seventh
circuit
as
to
special
damages.
the
seventh
circuit
held
also
besides
the
general
compensatory
damages
that
the
plaintiffs
who
raised
this
concept
of
in
course
of
$65
per
day
to
educate
the
child
and
the
concept
of
cost,
i
do
not
remember
exactly
$52
per
day
to
have
the
student
go
to
an
out
of
city
school,
that
was
raised
in
the
concept
of
a
special
damage
and
the
seventh
circuit
observed
at
that
point,
that
if
the
case
of
remand
had
to
determine
what
the
validity
that
has
as
special
damages,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
or
the
defendants
would
be
able
to
defend
that
position
by
showing
that
they
would
have
been
suspended
in
any
event,
have
they
been
afforded
an
adequate
due
process,
but
that
was
never
--
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
well,
of
course,
obviously
if
they
found
that
they
were
validly
suspended
then
i
do
not
think
the
issue
is
not
really
in
front
of
the
seventh
circuit
is
not
really
whether
the
suspensions
are
valid
--
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
with
regard
to
--
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
well,
if
they
found
that
was
valid
and
would
still
to
improve
damages,
i
believe
that
would
not
change
it
because
i
think
the
seventh
circuit
dealt
with
it
on
the
concept
that
regardless
of
the
consequences
of
the
suspension,
we
are
not
dealing
with
the
suspension
and
its
consequences
whether
or
not
it
would
be
justified
or
whether
or
not
it
was
valid,
the
question
is
whether
or
not
you
were
entitled
to
damages
just
for
the
proof
of
the
violation
of
the
deprivation
of
the
constitutional
right,
that
is
what
we
are
dealing
with
because
the
case,
seventh
circuit
held
in
a
prior
case
which
they
have
decided
--
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
well,
may
be
special
but
not
as
a
general
compensatory
damage
because
the
seventh
circuit
really
left
the
whole
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
suspension
was
valid.
they
said
that
does
not
matter.
there
is
something
inherent
in
a
nature
of
the
deprivation.
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
only
with
regard
to
the
special
damages
not
to
the
compensable
damages,
not
to
the
general
compensatory
--
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
that
may
be
open,
that
is
correct.
that
issue
of
the
suspension,
i
believe
that
the
suspension
would
be
open
to
as
the
special
damages
and
i
think
we
are
talking
about
in
that
point
a
total
of
$114
specials,
and
i
do
not
know
$70
or
$80
with
regard
to
the
other
plaintiff
and
as
to
special
damages.
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
law
of
the
case
as
it
stands
now
as
regardless
of
what
we
are
not
here
on
the
special
damage
issue,
we
are
here
on
the
right
to
recover
for
the
general
compensatory
damages
for
that
inherent
in
a
nature,
wrong
for
the
deprivations
of
the
constitutional
right
to
an
adequate
due
process
hearing.
it
does
not
matter
that
court
addressed
the
special
issue
differently
that
$65.
that
is
not
the
issue
that
is
something
which
the
court
tried
to
put
a
measure
on
some
special
damages
that
on
rule,
so
we
speak
on
terms
of
this
$65.
it
dealt
with
that
terms
of
special
damages.
they
say
it
does
not
matter,
if
you
do
not
have
any
individualized
injury,
no
pecuniary
loss,
does
not
matter
you
are
still
entitled
to
general
compensatory
damages
for
the
deprivation
of
a
constitutional
right.
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
that
is
correct.
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
we
did
not
raise
liability
that
is
correct
--
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
we
did
not
contest
liability.
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
no
we
are
not.
i
am
not
contesting
--
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
i
am
not
contesting
liability.
i
want
to
make
that
clear
as
i
argue,
we
are
contesting
liability.
there
were
some
questions
as
to
the
facts
i
do
not
think
it
is
necessary
to
get
to
the
issue
of
liability.
we
have
not
raised
that
issue.
the
main
thrust
of
a
lawsuit
below
was
the
question
of
our
board
rules,
they
were
held
to
be
that
court
did
not
reach
that
issue.
we
did
not
appeal
the
issue
of
liability
and
the
case
is
strictly
here
on
damages.
liability
was
not
raised
and
we
are
not
here
before
this
court
raising
the
issue
of
liability.
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
yes,
an
adequate
due
process
hearing.
i
want
to
make
that
clear
because
it
did
not
say,
inadequate,
the
court
did
not
say
it
was
failure
to
provide
an
adequate.
i
do
not
think
that
court
suggests
or
i
think
the
record
will
indicate.
they
did
not
say,
there
was
not
any
hearing.
they
just
said
that
there
was
an
adequate
due
process
hearing.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
this
holding
of
the
seventh
circuit
court
or
the
said
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
is
inconsistent
with
both
the
common
law
rules
for
damages
and
what
some
have
commonly
referred
to
these
42
u.s.c.1983
actions
as
constitutional
tort
or
indignity
tort.
the
traditional
law
of
damages
--well,
let
me
start
from
the
case,
this
court
ruled
in
monroe
v.
pape
in
1961
that
42
u.s.c.
1983
must
be
read
against
that
background
of
tort
liability
which
makes
a
man
responsible
for
the
natural
consequences
of
his
actions.
with
that
concept
in
mind,
we
believe
that
as
long
as
the
basis
of
liability
for
this
42
u.s.c.
1983
action
should
be
read
against
tort
liability
we
should
then
look
to
the
relief
granted
in
tort
law
to
determine
what
relief
should
be
granted
for
violations
of
this
42
u.s.c.
1983
actions.
as
this
court
is
well
aware
the
traditional
law
of
damages
in
which
counsel
concedes
the
common
law
rule
of
damages
and
tort
liability
does
not
recognize
any
loss
other
than
that
which
is
actual
loss.
the
law
has
always
recognized
as
a
anglo-american
law
has
always
been
compensation
oriented,
that
is
we
compensate
the
person
to
the
extent
that
money
can,
to
make
that
person
hold,
to
put
them
him
in
a
same
position
when
he
has
been
injured,
when
he
establishes
legal
injury,
that
he
would
have
been
had
the
deprivation
--
or
be
wrong
not
being
committed.
to
that
extent
we
believe
that
the
law
in
regarding
compensatory
damages
has
always
been
that
you
are
entitled
to
compensatory
when
you
have
established
your
actual
or
your
legal
injury,
your
effect
of
damage.
there
is
a
breach,
there
is
a
duty,
there
is
a
breach
of
that
duty.
there
is
a
legal
injury
and
once
you
have
established
that
legal
injury,
you
are
entitled
to
recover
based
upon
the
effect
of
damages.
we
have
also
recognized
that
just
because
once
you
have
established
the
effect
of
damage,
just
because
as
the
amount
cannot
be
determined
by
any
measurable
standard,
that
amount
has
to
be
cast
upon
the
wrongdoing
defendant.
once
you
have
established
the
effect
of
damage
because
the
court
has
recognized
that
once
you
have
established
the
effect
of
damages
you
can
leave
the
jury
to
determine
what
value
they
are
going
to
assess
upon
that
injury
that
--
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
we
are
absolutely
agree
with
that
proposition.
if
you
established
your
effect
of
damage,
if
you
established
your
legal
injury,
defendants
cannot
be
held
to
say
well,
these
damages
are
speculative,
therefore
you
are
not
entitled
to
it.
we
take
the
position
that
once
you
have
established
the
effect
of
damages
just
because
an
amount
cannot
be
placed
upon
it,
the
jury
would
still
be
left
it
to
make
that
determination
what
they
want
to
place
upon
that
violation
of
that
breach
of
the
duty.
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
plaintiff,
there
is
no
proof
and
both,
remember
it,
two
district
courts
determined
that
there
was
no
proof
of
that
in
the
evidence
and
the
seventh
circuit
--
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
no
proof
of
damages
and
nothing
which
would
even
form
any
speculative
inference
which
would
lead
to
any
measure
of
damages.
in
other
words,
--
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
no
proof
of
damages
and
again
to
problem
we
deal
with
is
in
concept
to
the
general
terms
of
damage
and
injury.
if
i
have
a
duty
and
someone
breaches
or
i
breach
the
duty,
i
may
be
injured,
but
that
is
as
a
general
concept
but
may
be
that
--
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
i
am
sorry.
i
may
have
injured
somebody
else
and
that
person
may
have
in
fact
been
injured
in
a
general
sense,
but
that
does
not
in
and
of
enough
itself
entitle
to
relief
until
he
is
established
that
he
has
in
fact
in
damage
or
he
has
established
the
effect
of
damage.
the
best
example
i
can
give
you
mr.
justice
would
be
in
lot
of
real
action,
if
you
negligently
running
to
me
you
may
cause
me
injury,
i
am
injured,
that
is
still
just
the
fact
that
i
am
injured
does
not
entitle
me
to
recover.
i
must
establish
as
a
result,
i
broke
my
arm
then
the
jury
can
determine
breaking
the
arm.
actual
injury
and
they
can
assess
an
intangible
loss,
the
pain
and
suffering
that
may
be
attached
to
that
actual
physical
loss
or
an
intangible
loss.
we
also
recognize
and
i
am
going
to
get
into
that,
we
have
recognized
that
compensatory
damages,
the
nature
of
compensatory
damages
are
two-fold
--
the
special
damage
which
is
to
compensate
the
actual
tangible
out
of
pocket
loss
and
the
general
compensatory
damages
which
is
to
compensate
the
actual
tangible,
intangible
losses
such
as
mental
distress,
such
as
pain
and
sufferings,
subjective
pain
and
suffering,
embarrassment,
mental
anguish,
emotional
distress.
we
have
recognized
that
once
you
have
established,
this
effect
of
damage
you
have
been
humiliated,
you
have
suffered
some
pain
and
suffering,
you
have
suffered
some
type
of
embarrassment,
then
at
that
point,
it
is
up
to
the
triar
of
fact
to
determine
what
amount
they
want
to
assess
against
the
defendants,
once
they
had
established
the
effect
of
damage,
that
intangible
loss.
the
tort
liability
or
the
tort
rules
of
damages
in
tort
law
have
recognized
that
where
there
is
no
actual
or
legal
injury
that
shall
be
no
recovered;
however,
the
common
law
has
recognized
and
i
think
this
court
is
well
aware
and
i
think
based
upon
the
decisions
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
and
the
amicus,
all
the
circuits,
i
should
not
say
all,
many
of
the
circuits
-
the
first,
the
second,
the
third,
the
fourth,
the
fifth,
the
tenth
have
recognized
that
where
there
is
an
invasion
of
some
paramount
right
and
you
have
not
established
any
actual
or
real
injury,
you
are
entitled
to
nominal
damages.
a
recognition
of
this,
just
of
the
violation
of
the
right
setting
up
this
person,
setting
up
the
rights
for
the
parties
and
recognized
that
in
that
situation
where
you
have
not
established
any
damages,
you
may
award
nominal
damages.
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
that
is
correct,
but
the
law
has
developed
in
the
circuits
and
in
the
lower
courts
and
the
district
courts,
after
the
monroe
case
by
the
way
--
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
constitutional
tort,
after
monroe
1944
i
believe
there
were
something
like
23
cases
filed
in
the
district
courts
for
violations
of
42
u.s.c.
1983,
1961
prior
to
the
case
of
monroe
v.
pape
where
this
court
decided
there
was
something
like
283
cases
filed,
in
1972
there
is
something
like
8,000
cases
filed
under
42
u.s.c.
1983
and
in
1976,
there
were
something
like
over
16,000
and
during
that
the
reason
i
bring
this
subject,
during
that
transitional
period
the
lower
courts
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
circuits
started
recognizing
the
right
to
recover
for
this
intangible
loss
and
they
also
recognized
the
right
to
recover
nominal
damages.
you
may
recover
nominal
damages
when
you
have
established
the
breach
of
the
constitutional
right
or
a
constitutional
tort.
the
seventh
circuit,
the
question
also
turns
around
whether
the
seventh
circuit,
created
a
new
relief.
our
position
is
that
seventh
circuit
created
a
new
relief
for
the
violation
of
42
u.s.c.
1983
which
had
not
been
previously
recognized
in
our
compensation
oriented
anglo-american
law.
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
that
is
correct.
i
think
that
in
order
to
make
a
determination
here,
we
have
to
break
them
up
in
terms
of
general
and
special
and
before
this
court
we
have
to
determine
whether
or
not
--
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
no,
the
court
said
that
both
courts
say
that
is
not
punitive.
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
that
is
correct.
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
well
--
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
that
is
correct
we
do
not
know
the
district
court
determined
that
there
was
no
proof
of
any
damages.
the
seventh
circuit
said
there
was
also
some
indication
that
(inaudible)
and
special,
but
that
is
not
here
though
--.
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
we
are
here
on
the
concept
of
the
general
--
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
that
is
correct,
absolutely.
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
general
damages
meant
a
loss
for
this
intangible.
this
is
something
that
you
cannot
put
a
monitory
value.
this
is
a
general
loss,
something
you
do
not
have
out
of
pocket,
not
something
which
you
can
put
--
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
no,
it
was
not,
no.
if
you
prove
the
effect
of
damage
then,
if
you
prove
that
humiliation,
if
you
prove
that
pain
and
suffering,
you
are
entitled
to
recompense
for
that
and
then
it
--
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
well,
i
think
you
did
in
terms
of
establishing
more
than
just
a
general
injury,
if
you
establish
a
deprivation
of
any
right,
if
you
are
negligently
breach
a
duty
which
you
owed
to
me,
i
have
to
establish
some
type
of
effect
of
damage.
i
cannot
just
again,
the
courts
have
recognized,
the
common
law
courts
have
recognized
that
you
just
cannot
let
the
jury
speculate
just
inform
these
violations
--
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
general
damages
mean
a
right
to
recover
as
i
see
money
damages
--
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
for
a
violation
or
some
right
to
duty
owed
where
you
have
established
some
type
of
injury
as
a
result.
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
no,
it
went
farther
because
it
said,
it
left
out
the
effect
of
damage.
it
presumed
some
type
of
effect
of
damage,
just
from
the
deprivation
of
the
constitutional
right.
it
went
farther
then,
the
court
of
appeals
said,
you
established
a
deprivation
of
the
right.
there
must
be
some
injury
here,
but
again
it
is
a
generalized
injury.
it
has
not
established
that
in
fact,
these
plaintiffs
have
been
injured
or
that
it
did
was,
well
there
must
be
some
injury
which
is
inherent
in
the
nature
of
the
wrong.
it
did
not
focus
on
the
individual
loss
or
the
effect
of
damage
to
that
plaintiff.
i
think
that
--
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
well,
i
think
it
would
be
the
same
issue.
i
think
that
the
courts
and
i
think
that
you,
in
my
briefs
and
in
the
counsel’s
brief
does
refer
to
the
voting
right
cases
in
the
search
and
seizure
cases,
many
of
the
search
and
seizure
cases
all
hold
this
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
or
most
of
them
hold
whether
there
is
a
deprivation
of
invasion
of
a
search
and
seizure
or
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
pursuant
to
fourteenth
amendment,
that
you
are
entitled
again
to
show
any
type
of
actual
damage.
i
think
once
you
have
established
the
actual
damage
are
entitled
to
relief.
if
you
have
not
established,
just
established
a
mere
deprivation
of,
an
invasion
of
the
right
to
be
free
from
the
search.
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
well,
in
the
voting
right
cases,
i
think
that
the
actual
damages,
again,
the
intangible
loss,
i
suggest
two
things
about
the
voting
right
cases
that
plaintiffs
had
cited.
first
of
all
or
at
that
we
are
talking
about,
many
of
the
courts,
the
lower
courts
and
the
circuits
deal
with
these
voting
right
cases,
the
one
that
they
deal
with
most
of
alls
the
case
of
wayne
v.
venable
and
that
one
says
damages
are
presumed
from
the
deprivation,
but
we
look
at
that
case.
that
case
is
a
conspiracy
case,
that
case
goes
beyond
than
mere
negligence,
it
goes
too
willful.
also
that
case
was
decided
by
the
eighth
circuit
in
1919.
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
well,
that
is
the
point.
that
is
why
i
am
suggesting
that
if
it
is
not
punitive
we
have
a
different
concept.
if
it
is
punitive
then
many
states
have
recognized,
you
are
not
entitled
to
recover
for
deprivation
of
the
voting
right
case.
the
majority
of
states
now
take
the
position
that
you
are
not
entitled
to
a
right
to
recover
for
a
deprivation
of
a
voting
right
unless
you
have
established
an
actual
malice
or
in
some
evil
intent.
as
far
as
the
wayne
also,
the
wayne
case
i
believe
if
the
court
looks
at
that
case.
it
says
you
are
entitled
to
presume
damages
even
though
you
have
not
shown
any
tangible
loss,
any
monitory
loss,
could
possibly,
i
think
it
suggests
two
things.
number
one,
the
idea
that
you
do
not
have
to
show
any
actual
damages
to
recover
punitive
damages,
the
idea
that
was
established
in
basista
v.
weir
the
third
circuit
case
and
also
i
think
it
started
to
recognize
as
i
indicated
before,
this
right
to
recover
for
this
intangible
loss.
you
do
not
have
to
prove
that
you
have
been
out
of
pocket,
that
you
have
had
any
tangible
loss.
you
have
a
right
to
recover
for
this
intangible
loss.
i
think,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
also
with
the
public
policy.
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
if
it
does
justice
marshall
--
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
if
he
was
injured
because
he
was
wearing
earing
and
he
was
deprived
of
something,
if
he
testifies
his
injuries
resulted
at,
then
he
may
be
entitled
to,
may
be
there
was
injury.
i
am
suggesting
that
may
be
there
is
some
injury
there.
they
are
may
very
well
be,
but
on
the
other
hand
--
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
if
he
testifies
to
it,
of
course
and
it
is
not
here.
there
is
nothing
to
establish,
there
is
nothing
to
establish
that
he
has
in
fact
been
injured.
this
court
recognized,
i
believe
in
the
case
of
in
the
dissent.
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
well,
if
he
is
injured
as
a
result
of
not
being
able
to
wear
the
earing,
if
he
is
injured
then
he
is
entitled
to
be
compensated.
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
not
in
these
facts,
not
in
this
record.
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
i
do
not
recall
exactly
what
the
relief
was
granted
in
that
case.
the
armband
case,
i
mean,
the
tinker
case
the
tinker
v.
they
talked
about
material
and
substantial
disruption.
you
have
to
show
that
there
is
some
material
and
substantial
--
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
but
in
that
case
--
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
but
just
being
denied
does
it
mean
that
if
so
fact
that
he
was
being
injured
and
i
thought
--
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
i
was
going
to
get
that.
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
exactly
what
the
point
is
--
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
that
is
correct.
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
that
is
absolutely
correct.
the
first
amendment
right
was
never
reached
and
in
fact,
the
court
just
talked
about
the
adequate
due
process
where
that
is
--
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
that
is
absolutely
--
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
it
was
never
reached
the
first
amendment.
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
that
was
never
reached.
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
that
is
correct.
that
is
what
the
wrong.
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
no,
my
answer
to
your
question
is
we
--
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
the
answer
to
your
question
in
terms
of
why
we
are
talking
about
general
and
special,
we
believe
that
the
laws
available
under
the
concept
of
the
tort,
the
general
rules
of
damages
allowable
in
tort
law
are
enough
to
compensate
the
person
for
a
deprivation
of
this
right,
but
he
is
got
to
establish
some
injury,
he
is
got
to
establish
some
effect
of
damage
for
the
denial
of
some
right.
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
before
he
is
entitled
to
recover
damages.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
at
the
time
i
left
to
caution
a
public
policy
also
which
should
be
considered
here
and
the
question
before
the
court
is
also
whether
the
court
should
adopt
this
new
relief.
court
faced
with
this
question
we
have
to
balance
the
interest
here
and
i
think
we
should
look
to
the
prior
decisions
in
this
court
in
wood
v.
strickland
and
in
goss
v.
lopez,
the
right
to
due
process
or
the
suspension
and
also
the
qualified
immunity
and
i
think
it
is
clear
that
the
majority
opinion
in
the
wood
case
suggests
that
we
really
should
leave
management
of
schools
to
the
school
districts,
we
really
should
leave
the
school
districts
alone
to
run
their
schools
and
we
really
should
be
in
a
position
not
to
deter
qualified
people
from
becoming
board
members,
from
becoming
board
personnel
and
we
should
not
impose
--
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
that
is
correct
and
i
think
we
--
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
yes,
i
think
so
because
again,
even
in
fourth
amendment
right
situations
the
concept
of
having
these
police
forded
with
this
concept
of
not
being
able
to
--
i
do
not
want
to
deal
very
much,
i
know
this
court
is
dealing
with
the
exclusion
and
i
do
not
want
to
deal
as
much
with
the
fourth
amendment,
but
i
do
want
to
point
out
that
where
there
is
a
deprivation
of
fourth
amendment
right.
there
are
policy
considerations
there,
whether
or
not
you
are
going
to
not
allow
police
officers
or
you
are
going
to
require
police
officers
to
almost
look,
torts
what
they
are
doing
if
there
is
a
later
determination
that
what
they
did
even
though
was
not
negligent,
caused
some
deprivation,
even
it
was
negligently
and
he
had
to
look
before
deterrent
effect
of
the
police
officers
as
we
do
to
deterrent
effect
here,
whether
or
not
we
should
deter
the
police
officers,
whether
we
should
deter
the
qualified
board
members,
whether
we
should
deter
their
duties
as
opposed
to
the
possible
benefits
that
would
approve
to
the
plaintiffs
in
this
matter.
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
that
is
correct
when
dealing
--
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
well,
i
believe,
i
understand
--
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
yes,
but
i
want
to
extend
that
idea
of
the
immunity
also
this
policy
consideration
and
i
--
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
excuse
me.
mr.
earl
b.
hoffenberg
but
when
you
say
knowing,
it
is
constructed
now
in
situation,
you
should
have
known
and
this
case
observed
that
in
dissent
of
this
case,
in
the
case
of
goss
v.
lopez,
this
concept
of
should
have
known
deals
with,
you
should
have
known
that
your
violated
constitutional
rights
deal
with
the
known
constitutional
law
and
as
the
dissent
says
knowing
constitutional
law
it
is
a
5:4
decision.
look
how
close
it
is
and
we
are
talking
about
knowing
what
constitutional
law?
in
conclusion
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
we
should
leave
the
operation
to
the
school
districts
and
we
should
also
leave
the
possibility
of
money
will
be
taken
out
at
tax
payer’s
end,
if
they
are
indemnified,
the
tax
payers
will
have
to
pay
for
and
wait
against
the
probability
of
some
speculative
damages
one
far
waives
the
other
one.
thank
you
very
much.
