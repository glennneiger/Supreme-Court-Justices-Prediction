justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
we
are
to
take
it
here
that
the
district
court
and
court
of
appeals
were
correct
in
deciding
or
assuming
that
these
people
were
denied
a
hearing
to
which
the
constitution
entitled?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
counsel
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
your
reply
brief
you
quote
from
the
dissenting
opinion
in
bigelow
v.
rko
from
what
you
have
just
said
i
take
it
you
accept
the
principle
laid
down
by
the
court
opinion
in
that
case
and
in
the
story
of
pachtman
that
if
some
damages
are
established
the
fact
that
you
cannot
put
a
precise
dollar
value
on
them,
does
not
mean
you
get
no
award
of
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
say
the
plaintiffs
here
did
not
even
establish
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
is
no
proof
of
what?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no
proof
of
injury?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
may
have
injured
somebody
else
that
is
what
you
are
saying?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now
that
rule
is
contrary
is
it
not,
to
the
common
law
where
at
contract
or
at
contract,
if
you
proved
the
breach
of
contract,
you
are
entitled
to
nominal
damages
but
in
tort
negligence
the
existence
of
damages
was
part
of
your
claim
for
relief
and
even
if
you
get
show
a
wrong
if
you
could
not
show
damage,
you
were
not
entitled
to
even
nominal
damages?
