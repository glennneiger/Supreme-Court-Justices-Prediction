mr.
john
s.
elson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
so
far
as
it
is
important
to
point
out
that
petitioners’
argument
is
directed
against
only
one
of
the
seventh
circuit’s
foregrounds
for
reversing
a
district
court,
this
now
is
very
clear.
the
petitioners
have
not
argued
that
it
was
erred
for
the
seventh
circuit
or
reverse
the
district
court
for
its
failure
to
grant
declaratory
or
injunctive
relief
or
for
its
failure
to
consider
the
evidence
that
was
in
the
record
which
quantified
respondent’s
injuries
from
being
wrongfully
denied
by
the
educational
services
for
a
17
days
school,
therefore
regardless
of
how
this
court
feels
about
the
question
raised
on
this
petition,
it
will
be
necessary
to
remand
this
case
in
order
that
the
district
court
can
enter
the
appropriate
declaratory
injunctive
relief
and
can
determine
the
damages
which
are
appropriate
for
the
wrongful
deprivation
of
respondent’s
educational
services.
mr.
john
s.
elson
yes,
the
--
mr.
john
s.
elson
right--
mr.
john
s.
elson
that
is
in
the
district
court
now
we
are
just
clarifying
that
that
is
not
here
and
that
is
not
before
this
court,
so
this
case
will
have
to
be
remanded
back
to
the
district
court
for
determination
of
those
damages,
regardless
of
how
this
court
determines
the
issue
raised
on
the
petitioner.
in
view
of
petitioner’s
statements
of
facts
in
their
briefs
and
partly
here,
i
think
it
is
necessary
to
clarify
that
certain
findings
of
district
court
are
not
in
issue
before
this
court.
first,
as
now,
it
is
crystal
clear
there
is
no
question
that
the
petitioners
have
violated
due
process
and
they
are
liable
for
damages
under
wood
v.
strickland
and
second,
despite
the
petitioners’
characterizations
of
respondents
there
is
no
basis
for
a
disputing
the
district
court’s
findings
that
the
respondents
always
denied,
the
wrongdoing
with
which
they
were
charged
and
that
they
were
never
given
an
adjudicatory
hearing
of
any
type
and
the
district
court
was
clear
on
that
point
said
specifically
they
were
never
given
adjudicatory
hearing.
mr.
john
s.
elson
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
for
determination
of
possible
consequential
injuries.
the
court
of
appeals
stated
that
if
the
school
board
shows
at
that
time
before
the
district
court
to
show
that
they
were
in
fact
guilty
of
what
they
are
charged
with
them,
they
do
not
get
compensatory
damages.
mr.
john
s.
elson
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
s.
elson
what
dispute
is
here?
mr.
john
s.
elson
well,
our
theory
is
that
it
is
incorrect
as
petitioners
due
to
equate
the
remedies
that
are
appropriate
for
constitutional
violations
with
the
remedies
that
are
appropriate
in
breach
of
contract
cases
in
technical
trespass
cases.
now,
in
those
cases
as
petitioners
correctly
stated
you
cannot
presume
damages
injury
from
the
violation
of
the
right
itself,
you
have
have
independent
evidence
of
the
injury.
mr.
john
s.
elson
of
the
harm.
mr.
john
s.
elson
right.
mr.
john
s.
elson
right,
like
walking
across
someone’s
grass
would
not
be
a
tangible
loss
and
that
it
has
something
else
for
a
technical
trespass.
mr.
john
s.
elson
no,
those
are
the
types
of
injuries
we
are
talking
about
that
can
be
presumed
from
the
violation
where
the
interests
which
are
protected
by
the
right
are
of
an
intangible
nature
such
as
liberty,
privacy,
reputation,
peace
of
mind,
dignity.
the
violation
of
the
rights
in
those
cases
approximately
and
necessarily
cause
injury
to
those
intangible
interests
and
it
is
by
(inaudible)
that
the
cases
of
invasions
of
privacy,
and
lied
on
slander
per
se,
false
imprisonment
and
false
arrest,
that
harm
is
presumed
from
the
very
violation
itself
and
no
independent
evidence
of
injury
is
required.
you
cannot
show
such
independent
evidence
of
injury
in
order
to
increase
your
damages,
but
the
cases
are
clear
you
do
not
have
to
show
that
type
of
independent
evidence.
and
many
courts
have
recognized
that
exactly
the
same
types
of
intangible
interests
that
are
at
stake
,
that
are
violated
in
these
common
law
tort
categories
are
also
injured
in
the
violation
of
civil
rights
and
petitioners
--
mr.
john
s.
elson
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
s.
elson
if
they
were
showing
of
the
actual
--
mr.
john
s.
elson
no.
mr.
john
s.
elson
i
think
that
the
appellate
court
would
reverse
and
find
that
their
award
was
not
justified
by
the
showing
of
injury.
there
are
some
early
very
early
common
law
tort
cases
when
this
theory
was
being
worked
out,
that
did
say
that
for
the
trespass
alone,
for
the
violation
you
can
get
damages,
but
that
is
not
the
law
now.
it
is
fairly
clear.
the
petitioners
had
agreed
with
the
many
cases
that
showed
the
state
that
intangible
injuries
are
caused
by
the
violation
of
civil
rights
and
the
rationale
for
presuming
damages
from
the
violation
of
the
right
in
the
civil
rights
cases
is
exactly
the
same
as
the
rationale
for
presuming
damages
in
these
common
law
intangible
injury
tort
cases
that
i
have
mentioned
here.
mr.
john
s.
elson
to
us
very
certain
that
that
is
a
very
serious
injury.
mr.
john
s.
elson
no,
it
is
not
the
issue.
mr.
john
s.
elson
that
is
not
in
this
case
because
they
have
not
raised
that
as
an
issue.
mr.
john
s.
elson
yes.
mr.
john
s.
elson
i
am
sorry
i
misspoke.
i
am
talking
about
the
bill
of
right
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
john
s.
elson
because
with
respect
to
those
constitutional
right,
there
may
be
other
constitutional
rights.
i
have
not
given
the
thought
to
the
whole
constitution,
but
with
respect
to
those
rights
intangible
injury
can
be
presumed
from
the
violation
itself
because
they
were
intended
to
protect
important
tangible
injuries
and
you
cannot
violate
those
rights
without
harming
those
injuries.
mr.
john
s.
elson
well,
i
suppose
there
would
be
certain
types
of
rights
where
you
just
cannot
presume
any
injury,
within
the
bill
of
rights,
that
eighth
amendment
violation
could
not
be
presumed
because
in
fact,
there
you
have
to
have
a
showing
of
serious
tangible
types
of
injury
and
i
suppose
the
same
might
be
true
with
the
interstate
commerce
clause,
i
am
not
really
sure.
i
have
not
--
mr.
john
s.
elson
the
principle
is
that
if
the
right
in
itself
is
inseparable
from
important
intangible
interests,
for
example,
if
a
school
should
make
public
a
student
say
a
prayer
against
his
religion
then
that
violates
his
first
amendment
freedom
to
pray
according
to
the
dictates
of
his
religion
and
that
in
itself
is
an
interest
protected
by
the
first
amendment
or
an
intangible
search
is
an
example
of
that
mr.
justice
harland
gave
in
his
concurrence
in
monroe
of
an
unconstitutional
search,
in
which
the
interest
invaded
there,
is
the
interest
of
being
secured
in
your
home
against
arbitrary
governmental
invasion
and
that
is
essence
of
the
fourth
amendment
or
in
this
case
--
mr.
john
s.
elson
i
think
it
very
well
might
--
mr.
john
s.
elson
well,
eighth
is
a
different
question.
mr.
john
s.
elson
i
would
not
think
you
could
in
a
presumed
damage
because
it
is
fairly
clear
that
in
order
to
reach
an
eighth
amendment
standard,
you
have
to
make
a
showing
of
fairly
serious
harm
to
the
person.
mr.
john
s.
elson
not
necessarily.
mr.
john
s.
elson
well,
not
necessarily.
you
would
have
to
look
at
the
right
and
see
whether
it
protects
some
intangible
interests.
mr.
john
s.
elson
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
s.
elson
well,
i
do
not
believe
that
it
would
be
appropriate
for
this
court
to
pick
and
choose
and
say
certain
rights,
we
cannot.
mr.
john
s.
elson
i
am
not
picking
or
choosing
now,
i
am
just
saying
why
i
think
that
injury
should
be
presumed
from
the
violation
of
the
right
itself
inevitably.
mr.
john
s.
elson
well,
possibly
not.
i
certainly
--
mr.
john
s.
elson
i
think
it
would
be
difficult
because
you
already
have
to
show
objective
proof
of
injury
in
order
to
qualify
for
an
eighth
amendment
violation
so
there
would
be
no
need
to
presume
damages.
mr.
john
s.
elson
yes,
certainly.
mr.
john
s.
elson
definitely.
mr.
john
s.
elson
well,
certainly
at
the
time
that
he
was
denied
his
right
to
a
jury
trial,
he
did
suffer
a
loss,
he
was
treated
unlike
other
citizens
with
the
civil
rights,
i
mean
may
possibly
if
the
jury
trial
did
not
make
any
difference
or
damages
certainly
would
not
be
enormous,
would
not
be
that
way,
but
he
did
suffer
a
loss
and
that
he
was
not
given,
he
suffered
certainly
the
indignity
of
not
having
his
right
to
a
jury
trial
or
--
mr.
john
s.
elson
yes,
that
would
be
one
measure
of
this
loss.
mr.
john
s.
elson
yes,
that
is
right.
mr.
john
s.
elson
because
according
to
the
rationale
of
the
seventh
circuit
and
which
we
of
course
agree,
there
is
a
separate
type
of
injury
from
being
deprived
of
the
right
itself.
mr.
john
s.
elson
well,
there
is
no
injury
and
the
injury
from
the
right
is
not
triggered
until
there
is
some
deprivation
of
a
protective
liberty
or
property
interest.
mr.
john
s.
elson
well,
because
that
is
a
separate
type
of
injury
and
sometimes
that
will
not
be
available,
for
instance
in
the
employment
cases.
mr.
john
s.
elson
there
has
been
at
the
time
that
the
violation
occurred.
there
is
certainly
a
right
was
taken
away
without
--
these
interests
were
taken
away
without
giving
these
procedural
rights.
now,
if
it
turns
out
later
that
in
fact,
the
government
official
was
justified
in
taking
away
those
rights,
then
he
is
not
entitled
to
the
damages
because
it
was
not
unfair,
he
did
not
really
lose
anything
by
the
deprivation
of
the
right.
mr.
john
s.
elson
he
was
at
the
time
of
the
deprivation.
mr.
john
s.
elson
well,
may
be
if
i
can
put
an
example
of
say
a
prisoner
who
is
in
prison
say
for
five
years
by
a
jailer
without
being
brought
before
a
judge,
and
it
subsequently
turns
out
that
if
the
there
is
say,
a
1983
suit
that
the
jailer
can
show
he
was
guilty
of
a
crime
that
he
would
have
been
sentenced
to
the
mandatory
of
minimum
five
year
sentence.
according
to
the
rationale
of
no
presumed
injury,
there
would
be
as
if
the
right
to
a
trial
did
not
exist.
it
would
be
as
if
he
was
not
deprived
of
anything
when
this
is
one
of
the
most
fundamental
of
our
constitution.
mr.
john
s.
elson
no,
not
necessarily;
however
where
there
is
a
loss
then
damages
of
the
traditional
common
law
remedy
in
order
to
remedy
of
that
loss.
mr.
john
s.
elson
yes.
well,
there
can
be.
where
it
is
just
a
common
law
principle.
mr.
john
s.
elson
no,
certainly
not
necessarily.
mr.
john
s.
elson
there
would
have
to
be
a
showing
that
the
violation
of
his
right
was
knowing
or
negligent
or
that
the
official
should
have
known
that
he
was
violating
the
right
certainly
if
it
were
done
by
a
judicial
officer
with
absolute
immunity
or
in
the
state’s
attorney,
so
that
would
be
very
unlikely
that
that
would
actually
happen.
mr.
john
s.
elson
yes
there
may
be
is
a
real
loss.
there
may
be
a
real
loss
and
as
i
believe
there
is
a
real
loss
and
somebody
is
deprived
of
a
right
to
a
trial.
mr.
john
s.
elson
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
s.
elson
yes.
mr.
john
s.
elson
possibly
if
all
the
requirements
have
been
met.
in
further
response
to
mr.
justice
stevens’
question
another
reason
for
the
injury
suffered
by
the
deprivation
of
due
process
is
the
lost
opportunity
to
make
your
case
to
be
initial
triar
of
fact,
and
that
is
something
different
from
the
deprivation
of
the
interest
itself
and
that
is
something
you
can
never
know
at
that
time
what
the
opportunity
to
make
your
case
to
the
discretionary
judgment
of
the
initial
triar
of
fact
would
have
availed,
so
even
if
it
is
determined
later
--
mr.
john
s.
elson
well,
that
may
be
one
--
mr.
john
s.
elson
that
may
be
one
measure,
but
it
would
be
a
very
drastic
penalty
on
our
government
to
make
them
pay
for
five
years
imprisonment
that
should
have
been
served
and
would
have
been
served
had
due
process
not
been
violated.
in
this
sense,
the
seventh
circuit
--
mr.
john
s.
elson
no,
that
is
correct,
but
in
the
rationale
of
an
employment
case
where
those
immunities
would
not
occur
if
someone
who
has
deprived
of
an
appointment
or
without
a
hearing
and
it
turns
out
that
there
was
all
sorts
of
cause
to
get
rid
of
that
person
and
the
person
is
out
say
for
ten
years
or
something
under
that
rationale,
those
injuries
have
been
the
only
measure
of
damage,
the
damages
would
be
tremendous
for
an
employee
who
should
have
been
fired
and
the
seventh
circuit’s
position
really
is
kind
of
a
mere
way
between
that.
it
just
gives
damages
for
the
actual
harm
suffered
by
the
deprivation
of
the
right.
mr.
john
s.
elson
no,
none
at
all
because
there
was
no
protected
liberty
or
property
interest,
that
was
violated.
mr.
john
s.
elson
there
is
not.
it
triggers
the
harm.
mr.
john
s.
elson
that
is
right.
mr.
john
s.
elson
yes
if
there
was
no
due
process
violation
on
the
first
place
--
mr.
john
s.
elson
yes.
mr.
john
s.
elson
that
is
right.
that
would
be
our
position,
that
is
what
the
seventh
circuit
said,
but
the
seventh
circuit
said
nevertheless
since
there
was
a
deprivation
of
due
process
at
the
time,
you
were
deprived
to
something
--
mr.
john
s.
elson
right
and
that
is
something
--
mr.
john
s.
elson
yes,
that
in
itself
is
compensable.
mr.
john
s.
elson
i
do
not
believe
it
was.
mr.
john
s.
elson
yes,
it
was
later
determined
that
it
was
zero.
because
at
the
time
you
were
deprived
of
your
interest
in
having
a
hearing
and
making
your
case
to
the
initial
decision
maker
besides
the
indignity
that
they
were
suffering.
given
that
the
constitutional
rights,
our
position
cannot
be
separated
from
the
from
the
intangible
interests
which
those
rights
are
intended
to
protect,
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
common
law
has
long
recognized
that
the
damages
may
be
presumed
from
the
violation
of
civil
rights
themselves.
there
are
no
special
remedial
rules
for
civil
rights
cases
which
exempt
them
from
this
normal
rule
that
damages
should
be
presumed
where
intangible
injuries
are
the
natural
and
proximate
result
of
a
violation
and
since
1703
in
the
english
voting
rights
case
of
ashby
v.
white,
the
common
law
has
recognized
the
principle
that
every
injury
to
a
right
import
to
damage.
mr.
justice
holmes
relied
on
this
principle
in
nixon
v.
herndon.
in
that
case,
held
that
a
valid
claim
for
substantial
damages
were
stated
when
the
only
harm
alleged
was
the
deprivation
of
equal
protection
which
arose
out
of
the
denial
of
the
right
to
vote
on
the
basis
of
race.
i
think
our
brief
incorrectly
describe
that
as
a
voting
rights
case
but
in
fact
it
is
an
equal
protection
case.
and
there
are
also
many
other
american
voting
rights
cases
that
recognized
this
principle.
now,
petitioner’s
argument
is
not
only
contrary
to
these
common
law
cases,
it
is
also
contrary
to
congressional
intent
that
courts
apply,
the
most
effective
remedies
that
are
available
for
the
purpose
of
deterring
violations
of
the
constitutional
rights.
it
is
clear
from
the
congressional
debates
and
from
many
opinions
of
this
court
that
the
primary
purpose
of
congress
in
enacting
the
ku
klux
act
of
1871
was
to
deter
constitutional
rights
of
the
violations
and
in
section
1988
of
title
42
congress
gave
the
court
specific
direction
as
to
how
they
were
to
apply
remedial
principles
under
the
civil
rights
clause
in
order
to
achieve
that
deterrent
purpose
and
as
this
court
stated
in
sullivan
v.
little
hunting
park,
courts
would
use
whichever
federal
and
state
rules
on
damages
would
better
serve
the
policies
of
the
federal
statutes.
now,
the
technical
trespass
damage
rules
proposed
by
petitioners
would
obviously
be
less
effective
in
deterring
civil
rights
violations
than
the
damage
rules
in
the
voting
rights
case
and
these
intangible
injury
cases
and
nixon
v.
herndon.
a
rule
that
required
independent
proof
of
injury
for
the
award
of
damages
for
civil
rights
violations
would
give
officials
absolute
immunity
from
damages
where
the
nature
of
the
constitutional
right
is
such
or
the
circumstances
of
a
violation
are
such
that
affirmatively
provable
injury
is
unlikely
to
result
from
the
violation.
examples
of
the
first
amendment
cases
or
due
process,
and
it
is
exactly
such
absolute
immunity
the
petitioners
are
asking
for
in
their
reply
brief
on
page
28
where
they
query,
whether
as
a
result
of
the
seventh
circuit’s
decision
educators
would
have
to
think
about
it,
they
research,
their
own
discretionary
acts
in
terms
of
the
possibility
that
a
court
might
find
them
liable
for
damages
for
violating
a
person’s
civil
rights,
but
it
was
precisely
to
force
officials
to
give
consideration
to
avoiding
constitutional
rights
that
this
court
rejected
educator’s
claims
of
absolute
immunity
in
wood
v.
strickland.
there
is
nothing
about
that
particular
type
of
compensatory
damages
awarded
for
the
deprivation
of
civil
rights
which
is
relevant
to
whether
educators
should
be
allowed
to
violate
constitutional
rights,
free
of
any
concern
for
their
accountability
under
the
civil
rights
clause.
the
rationale
would
require
us
that
public
officials
not
be
given
such
a
zone
of
immunity
for
their
constitutional
violations
where
the
interest
protected
by
the
rights
are
of
such
an
intangible,
unquantifiable
nature.
mr.
john
s.
elson
well,
in
that
case
such
evidence
certainly
would
go
toward
the
reducing
mitigation
of
the
damages.
mr.
john
s.
elson
no,
not
to
zero.
mr.
john
s.
elson
well,
i
would
point
out
that
is
not
this
case.
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
case,
but
yes
i
would
say
that
the
intent
of
congress
is
that.
mr.
john
s.
elson
is
that
the
most
effective
remedies
available
in
the
common
law
are
to
be
used
and
the
presumption
of
damages
from
the
violation
itself
is
a
remedy
that
is
traditional
that
the
common
law
and
should
be
used
in
these
cases.
mr.
john
s.
elson
no,
certainly
they
are
limited
that,
but
with
the
instruction
as
the
seventh
circuit
--
mr.
john
s.
elson
with
the
instruction
that
the
damages
be
not
so
small
as
the
seventh
circuit
said
to
trivialize
the
right.
now,
a
normal
award
--
mr.
john
s.
elson
well,
first
i
would
pose
that
that
is
not
unreal
in
type
of
situation
because
there
is
always
injury
as
our
position
when
these
rights
are
violated,
but
for
purposes
of
the
hypothetical,
i
would
analogize
it
in
liable
per
se
where
there
is
inconclusive
presumption
of
some
injury
which
of
course
cannot
be
mitigated
by
such
a
showing.
mr.
john
s.
elson
i
believe
that
might
be
contrary
to
what
the
rule
is
for
liable
per
se.
it
may
return
it,
but
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
s.
elson
it
might
be
entitled
to
more
damages.
mr.
john
s.
elson
i
think
it
might
well
not
be
and
yes,
under
the
normal
rules
where
there
is
a
conclusive
presumption
of
some
injury,
now
it
is
possible.
mr.
john
s.
elson
well,
that
would
be
normal
for
a
substantial
compensatory
injury.
mr.
john
s.
elson
in
that
case,
if
there
were
substantial
evidence
mitigating
conclusive
presumption
of
damages,
then
it
could
be
reduced.
now,
to
$1,
i
am
not
sure
because
that
would
conflict
in
this
case
with
the
deterrent
policies
of
congress.
mr.
john
s.
elson
if
i
were
a
juror
--
mr.
john
s.
elson
i
am
not
really
positive,
i
think
in
the
nature
between
$500
and
$1,000
possibly
i
really
have
not
given
it.
mr.
john
s.
elson
one
of
complaints,
there
was
one
who
requested
$3,000
that
was
at
the
time
when
punitives
were
also
asked
for.
mr.
john
s.
elson
brisco,
it
was
originally
filed
as
a
class
action,
no
class
was
certified.
mr.
john
s.
elson
no,
these
are
consolidated
cases
in
the
district
court
with
two
students
--
mr.
john
s.
elson
yes,
at
the
time
--
mr.
john
s.
elson
well,
they
were
represented
by
different
attorneys
i
guess
--that
amounts
to
different
amounts,
but
in
terms
there
are
differences
in
the
fact
situations
of
course,
which
may
justify
the
juries
coming
up
with
different
awards
of
damages.
there
were
first
amendment
protected
interest
implicated
in
the
brisco
case
not
implicated
in
the
piphus
case.
mr.
john
s.
elson
yes,
that
would
be,
but
the
injury
that
to
be
presumed
from
the
violation
itself
would
not
be
the
same
for
all
plaintiffs
across
the
board.
mr.
john
s.
elson
no,
not
necessarily.
there
is
no
incentive
for
plaintiffs
to
file
suits
in
order
to
pay
off
an
attorney.
there
is
the
removal
of
a
disincentive
and
that
they
might
have
--
mr.
john
s.
elson
yes.
mr.
john
s.
elson
but
perhaps
i
was
in
error
and
--
mr.
john
s.
elson
well,
perhaps
--
mr.
john
s.
elson
the
point
to
that
however
is
that
the
law
presumes
conclusively
that
some
damages
have
occurred
and
in
rebuttal
certainly,
in
mitigation
of
those
damages
can
be
lowered
to
a
minimal
amount.
mr.
john
s.
elson
no,
oh,
in
the
complaint
it
makes
the
claim
for
malice,
but
that
was
not
proved
that
that
is
not
in
issue.
mr.
john
s.
elson
that
is
correct.
