may
i
interrupt?
and
that
very
point,
supposing
the
49
proclamation
had
been
as
clear
as
i
think
justice
rehnquist
suggested
and
said
we
reserve
as
a
national
monument
the
submerged
lands
as
well
as
the
waters
in
the
inlets
and
outlets
and
all
that,
would
you
still
make
the
same
argument
based
that
–
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no
--
based
on
the
interpretation
of
the
1953
statue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
you
said
they
already
do
–
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
concede
that
they
had
the
power
to
do
that?
justice
john
paul

why
isn't
that
the
claim
of
right
doctrine
resting
on
the
presidential
proclamation
pursuant
to
the

the
antiquity's
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
this
be
--
i
just
and
i'm
--
would
this
be
a
fair
statement
of
your
argument
that
--
we
should
read
the
original
decision
and
the
statute
as
saying
in
affect
that
any
claim
of
right
shall
be
decided
as
though
the
california
case
had
been
decided
the
other
way?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
it
had
been
decided
the
other
way
then
president
truman
would
not
have
had
the
power
in
1949
to
make
any
reservation?
