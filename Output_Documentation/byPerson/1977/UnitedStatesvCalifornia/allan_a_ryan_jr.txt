mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
cross
motions
for
entry
of
a
third
supplemental
decree.
the
areas
in
dispute
are
two
one
mile
belts
of
water
and
submerged
lands
surrounding
the
two
islands
which
together
comprised
the
channel
islands
national
monument
and
i
invite
the
court’s
attention
to
page
68
of
the
appendix,
beige
document
which
contains
a
diagram
or
a
map
of
the
area
in
dispute
and
the
surrounding
area.
anacapa
island
is
about
12
miles
off
shore
and
santa
barbara
island
about
35
miles
off
shore
the
coast
of
the
california.
the
islands
themselves
are
about
40
miles
apart.
these
islands
were
established
as
the
channel
islands
national
monument
in
1938
by
presidential
proclamation
of
president
roosevelt.
in
1949,
both
parties
agreed.
president
truman,
in
a
presidential
proclamation,
expanded
the
monument
by
adding
to
it
and
i
quote
from
his
proclamation
which
is
on
page
67
of
the
appendix,
adding
to
it
“the
areas
within
one
nautical
mile
of
the
shore
line
of
the
anacapa
and
santa
barbara
islands
as
indicated
on
diagram,”
the
diagram
being
that
on
page
68.
the
united
states
believes
that
by
this
language
president
truman
added
to
the
monument
everything
within
one
mile
of
each
of
the
island.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
yes
mr.
justice
stewart
it
was.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
specifically
it
was,
yes
sir.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
we
believe
that
proclamation
added
to
the
monument
everything
within
one
mile
of
the
shoreline;
waters
submerge
lands
and
natural
resources.
this
conclusion
is
supported
not
only
the
words
and
the
diagram
of
the
proclamation
itself
but
by
the
executive
history
of
the
proclamation.
california
contends
that
president
truman
added
only
rocks
and
islets
within
one
mile
of
the
islands,
although
california
candidly
concedes
that
both
the
language
and
the
executive
history
of
the
proclamation
do
not
unequivocally
support
its
reading.
if
this
court
decides
that
president
truman
did
indeed
include
the
waters
and
submerged
lands
within
one
mile
in
it's
proclamation,
it
must
ten
decide
the
second
issue
presented
by
this
case,
i.e.
did
the
submerged
lands
act
of
1953
cede
these
lands
and
waters
to
california
as
california
contends,
or
were
they
exempted
by
section
5
of
that
act
which
provides
that
the
united
states
will
retain
lands
occupied
by
claim
of
right.
as
to
the
first
issue,
the
primary
dispute
between
the
parties
centers
on
what
president
truman
meant
by
the
word
areas,
when
he
added
“the
areas
within
one
nautical
mile
of
the
shore
lines”
of
the
two
islands.
the
word
“areas”
is
of
course
far
more
inclusive
than
the
specific
words
of
rocks
and
islets
and
california
has
yet
to
suggest
why
if
president
truman
had
intended
to
include
only
rocks
and
islets,
he
would
have
used
such
as
expansive
and
inaccurate
word
as
“areas.”
furthermore
the
map
or
diagram
on
page
68
which
was
incorporated
by
reference
in
to
the
proclamation,
shows
a
boundary
line
running
one
mile
around
both
islands
with
acreage
figures
that
describe
the
total
surface
area
of
the
islands
into
the
one
mile
of
water
surrounding
the
islands.
finally
the
diagram
does
not
depict
a
single
rock
or
islet
within
the
boundary
line
except
for
some
rocks
that
lie
a
few
hundred
yards
off
the
shore
of
santa
barbara
and
obviously
no
one
mile
boundary
was
necessary
to
include
them.
california
has
yet
to
explain
why
a
proclamation
that
was
designed
to
include
rocks
and
islets
within
the
boundaries
of
the
monument
omitted
to
describe
or
depict
those
objects.
in
all
we
believe
it’s
clear
that
the
proclamation
did
exactly
what
it
said
it
was
doing,
adding
all
areas
within
one
mile
of
the
islands
and
the
areas
cannot
be
reasonably
understood
to
mean
nearly
some
rocks
and
islets,
but
must
mean
the
waters,
lands,
natural
resources
in
short
everything
within
one
mile
of
the
two
islands.
the
parties
have
collected
the
various
memos,
letters,
and
other
materials
which
led
up
to
the
signing
of
this
proclamation
a
sort
of
legislative
history
as
it
were
and
if
any
doubt
as
to
the
scope
of
the
proclamation
exits,
this
history
certainly
removes
it.
in
a
nutshell
this
history
reveals
that
after
president
roosevelt
established
the
channel
islands
national
monument
in
1938
by
reserving
the
islands
themselves,
it
was
almost
immediately
realized
that
those
boundaries
were
inadequate
to
protect
the
wide
variety
of
marine
mammals
and
plant
life
that
thrived
in
the
waters
around
the
islands.
federal
officials
and
naturalists
agree
that
federal
jurisdiction
should
extend
into
the
water,
but
at
that
time,
california
and
the
united
states
were
engaged
in
litigation
before
this
court
to
determine
who
owned
the
three-mile
belt
beyond
the
coast
of
california
and
these
islands
i
might
add
politically
are
part
of
the
state
of
california
so
that
the
three-mile
question
at
issue
involve
these
islands.
in
view
of
the
conflicting
claims
that
were
then
before
the
california,
the
united
states
during
this
period
of
the
mid
40s
took
no
definitive
action
to
expand
the
monument
because
there
was
doubt
that
it
had
the
legal
power
to
do
so,
regardless
of
how
advisable
such
action
might
have
been
from
a
naturalist
standpoint.
that
question
of
course
was
settled
by
this
court
in
1947
in
favor
of
the
united
states
when
this
court
held
in
the
first
california
decision
that
the
united
states
had
paramount
rights
over
the
land,
minerals
and
other
things
in
the
pacific
ocean
lying
seaward
of
the
low
water
mark.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
there
was
no
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
no
i
would
not
take
that
position
mr.
justice
blackmun.
before
1947
i
would
say
that
the
question
was
in
dispute
and
there
was
no
definitive
resolution.
i
wouldn't
go
so
far
as
to
say
we
had
no
claim.
i
think
our
claim,
the
united
states
claim
was
that
there
was
placed
before
the
court
in
california
one.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
if
the
47
case
had
come
out
the
other
way
we
would
have
no
claim
in
1949.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
it
could
not
have
been
expanded
in
the
way
that
president
truman
did
so
and
if
president
eisenhower
had
tried
to
do
this
in
1959
after
the
submerged
lands
act
was
passed
would
not
be
possible.
it
was
only
in
that
period
of
time
prior
to
the
submerged
lands
act
that
the
united
states
had
claim
to
this
territory.
how
far
back
it
went
in
response
to
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
couldn't
say.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
there
was
really
no
difference
as
a
matter
of
law.
the
only
difference
for
these
purposes
is
that
by
making
it
a
national
monument
that
gives
it
certain
protection.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
it
did
not
because
of
the
claim
of
right
exception.
had
it
not
been
for
the
claim
of
right
exception
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
no,
the
area
which
was
held
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
that's
true,
but
the
claim
of
right
exception
did
not
include
those
lands
which
the
united
states
owned,
if
you
will,
only
by
virtue
of
the
california
one
decree,
the
paramount
rights
doctrine.
the
congress
specifically
said
claim
of
right
does
not
include
that
vast
area
of
sea
that
we
own
--
by
california
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
they
would
have
owned
the
islands,
but
had
the
decision
come
out
the
other
way,
i
don't
think
that
president
truman
in
1949
could
have
simply
reserved
this
area
and
said
i
proclaim
it
a
national
monument,
he
may
have
been
able
to
proceed
by
eminent
domain
or
another
fashion.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
the
islands
were
a
federal
monument
at
least
as
far
--
federal
territory
--
lighthouse
territory
at
least
is
far
back
as
1854.
they
have
been
in
federal
hands
at
least
since
that
date,
when
they
were
used
as
lighthouses.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
the
entire
island
at
least
down
to
the
high
water
or
most
down
to
the
–
i
am
sorry
at
least
down
to
the
high
water.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
will
talk
about
it
right
now
and
say
that
we,
the
united
states
has
no
claim
to
the
tidelands.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
because
the
tidelands
historically
have
been
considered
inland
waters
of
a
state.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
no
the
–
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
president
roosevelt's
proclamation
did
not
–
it
did
not
include
the
tidelands.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
well,
in
that
case,
i
would
have
to
say
that
it
excluded
it
by
implication,
because
tidelands
at
least
since
the
case
of
pollard's
lessee
by
this
court
tidelands
have
been
considered
inland
waters
of
the
state.
and
president
roosevelt
just
by
proclaiming
it
a
national
monument
could
not
have
taken
the
tidelands
back
from
the
states.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
well
as
to
the
territory
at
issue
here
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
that
is
the
result
mr.
justice.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
well,
the
islands
politically
are
a
part
of
the
state
of
california
like
nantucket
is
a
part
of
massachusetts.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
yes
it
is.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
but
the
tidal
waters
remained
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
we
concede
them
away
if
that's
what
we
are
doing
simply
because
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
we
are
not
before
this
court
asking
for
the
tidelands
that's
–
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
and
the
reason
that
we
are
not
is
because
as
we
read
president
roosevelt's
proclamation
in
1938
he
had
powers,
if
you
will,
only
to
reserve
the
areas
of
the
united
states
controlled
and
the
united
states
did
not
control
the
–
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
could
not
have
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
--
could
not
take
the
tidelands.
it
does
result
in
odd
situation
where
the
united
states
owns
the
land
and
one
mile
beyond
the
land
and
california
retains
the
tidelands.
it's
--
i
won't
argue
that
that's
the
most
rational
result
in
the
world,
but
on
the
current
state
of
affairs
i
think
that's
what
is
the
result.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
well,
they
were
looking
at
two
different
things.
he
did
not
have
more
power
as
--
we
are
not
contending
that
he
did.
president
roosevelt
reserved
only
the
islands.
that's
specific.
he
said
these
two
islands
are
reserved.
president
truman
responding
to
the
claims
and
the
treaties
of
naturalists
and
park
service
officials
and
others,
said
president
roosevelt
didn't
go
far
enough,
the
lands
themselves
are
not
adequate
to
protect
the
marine
life,
we
will
have
to
include
the
waters
and
so
forth,
the
submerged
lands
around
there
and
he
used
the
word
areas
to
achieve
that
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
well
he
did,
yes.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
would
say
that
right
now,
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
don't
--
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
shows
that.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
would
say
it's
a
matter
of
feet.
i
don't
know
how
much
the
tide
rises
and
falls.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
no
i
am
sorry.
that
--
there
is
–
the
tidelands
which
separate
the
federal
islands
from
the
federal
water
probably
can
be
measured
in
feet
i
am
sure.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
from
the
line
of
mean
lower
low
water,
which
is
the
california
coast
line
up
to.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
that
is
the
sea
where
it
ends
of
the
tidelands.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
well,
california
raises
that
point
in
their
brief.
i
don't
think
that
that
is
a
--
anything
more
than
administrative
problem.
it
can
be
certainly
worked
out
between
the
united
states
and
california
as
to
who
will
administer
what.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
well
i
think
mr.
justice
that
it
bears
not
so
much
on
the
reasonableness
of
our
interpretation
an
on
the
realities
of
the
law
that
is
--
that
the
united
states
could
not
have
simply
appropriated
those
tidelands
in
1949
or
at
any
other
time
as
it
appropriated
what
was
around
it.
i
am
sure
that
had
–
those
tidelands
been
available
president
truman
would
have
included
them
and
that
would
have
been
the
only
sensible
way
to
do
it,
but
as
a
matter
of
the
law
at
least
since
pollard's
lessee
those
lands
were
not
available
to
the
united
states.
and
i
would
say
that
whatever
problems
our
presented
to
the
administration
by
this
6
foot
or
whatever
it
is
section
of
tidelands
are
something
that
can
be
worked
out
between
california
and
the
united
states
and
i
would
agree
that
it
is
a
not
a
reason
to
find
in
california's
favor
in
this
case.
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
when
the
question
came
up
not
only
in
the
or
especially
in
the
post
of
proclamation
administration
period
of
this
area,
as
to
whether
the
federal
government
had
jurisdiction
over
submerged
lands,
the
national
park
service
which
was
charged
with
the
administration
of
the
area
specifically
referred
to
the
submerged
lands
as
being
under
it's
jurisdiction
and
the
parties
have
been
able
to
find
no
evidence
that
california
ever
contested
that
interpretation.
california
i
am
sure
has
looked
harder
for
it
than
united
states
did,
but
the
joint
appendix
is
here
and
there
is
no
question
raised
in
these
materials
as
to
any
dispute
by
california
at
the
time
that
federal
jurisdiction
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
yes
mr.
justice
yes,
that's
–
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
correct.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
what
california
has
is
determined
by
the
line
of
mean
low
water,
which
is
a
statistical
measurement
drawn
out
over
years.
it
does
not
vary
from
day
to
day
with
that
day's
tides.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
in
relation
to
these
islands?
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
honestly
do
not
mr.
justice
and
it's
not
–
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
am
sure
that
somebody
does.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
it
is
a
fact
and
it's
a
fact
that
judicial
notice
can
be
taken
of
if
we
knew
what
the
fact
was
which
we
don't
if
the
court
to
determines
in
the
favor
of
the
united
states
that
all
waters
and
lands
were
included
in
president
truman's
proclamation
that
brings
up
the
second
question
in
the
case
which
is
whether
the
submerged
land's
act
gave
this
all
to
california
in
1953.
the
submerge
land's
act
was
enacted
by
congress
in
1953
to
give
the
states
title
to
the
lands
and
resources
lying
up
to
3
miles
seaward
off
their
coast
lines.
had
congress
stopped
there,
a
case
could
be
made
that
the
disputed
area
here
was
relinquish
to
california,
but
congress
for
very
good
reasons
did
not
stop
there.
in
section
5(a)
of
the
act
it
accepted
from
the
operation
of
the
act
and
i
quote
“any
rights
the
united
states
has
in
lands
presently
and
actually
occupied
by
the
united
states
under
claim
of
right.”
the
parties
have
stipulated
for
purposes
of
this
litigation
that
the
disputed
areas
here
were
“presently
and
actually
occupied
within
the
meeting
of
the
statute
by
the
united
states
after
the
1949
proclamation”
and
so
we
agree
that
the
only
issue
was
whether
the
united
states
occupied
them
under
claim
of
right.
both
parties
agree
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
submerged
lands
act
shows
beyond
any
doubt
that
congress
did
not
include
under
the
claim
of
right
exception,
the
so
called
doctrine
of
paramount
rights
to
which
i
referred
a
moment
earlier,
which
this
court
announced
in
1947.
the
reason
that
congress
made
clear
that
claim
of
rights
did
not
include
paramount
rights
is
obvious.
such
a
construction
would
have
retained
everything
that
the
congress
was
trying
to
give
back,
would
have
rendered
act
to
nullity.
on
the
other
hand
the
reason
congress
inserted
the
claim
of
right
language
in
the
first
place
is
equally
obvious.
it
was
giving
back
to
the
states
only
those
areas
which
the
united
states
occupied
or
where
jurisdiction
extended
based
on
paramount
rights.
it
was
certainly
not
giving
to
the
states,
federal
military
bases,
naval
ranges,
national
monuments
and
other
areas
which
the
federal
government
was
actually
using
at
the
time
for
various
purposes.
congress
also
did
not
want
to
give
up
any
claim
or
rights
that
the
united
states
might
have
to
areas
that
in
dispute
and
so
it
shows
the
language,
claim
of
right,
to
include
those
disputed
areas
as
well
as
areas
which
the
federal
government
occupied
without
dispute.
mr.

a.
ryan,
jr.
presidential
proclamation
for
the
entire
three-mile
belt
–
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
--
beyond
the
coast
of
california?
i
would
think
you
would
have
to
look
first
at
what
authority
he
had
to
do
that.
the
antiquities
act
of
1906
which
is
the
statutory
authority
for
these
two
proclamations,
i
think
probably
could
not
be
construed
to
include
the
thousands
of
square
miles
that
–
decree
like
you
suggest
would
include,
but
assuming
that
there
were
some
statutory
authority
to
do
that
and
he
could
reserve
it
as
a
national
monument
or
something
of
that
nature,
i
would
say
that
would
be
a
claim
of
right.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
at
a
minimum
the
presidential
proclamation
has
to
be
a
valid
one.
for
purposes
of
this
case
i
would
want
to
say
that
a
claim
of
right
could
be
voided
if
it
could
be
shown
that
the
statutory
authority
underlying,
it
was
insufficient
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
it
does
not
--
united
states
did
not
need
title.
claim
of
right
is
something
which
is
generally
understood
to
mean
something
less
than
title
and
so
by
inserting
that
language.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
yes
and
a
claim
that
you
wanted.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
the
1949
proclamation
by
president
truman.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
the
antiquities
act
of
1906,
but
california
has
taken
the
position
that
the
antiquities
act
of
1906
does
not
authorize
president
truman
to
do
as
much
as
he
did
in
1949.
our
position
is
first
that's
wrong,
that
it
did
authorize
him,
but
secondly
if
it
came
to
that
--
that
we
would
say
that
doesn't
void
the
entire
presidential
proclamation.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
that's
right.
the
claim
of
right
exception,
time
after
time
in
the
congressional
debate
was
considered
to
be
something
that
neither
validated
nor
prejudiced
any
claims
and
we
certainly
don't
rely
on
that
as
validating
this
claim.
it's
a
presidential
proclamation,
but
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
a
claim
of
right
more
definite
and
more
explicit
than
a
statement
by
the
president
of
united
states
that
he
is
reserving
these
areas
for
purposes,
statutory
purposes
authorized
by
the
congress.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
well
the
united
states
there
is
no
dispute
i
think,
perhaps
i
shouldn't
say
that
but
we
think
it's
certainly
clear
that
by
the
doctrine
of
paramount
rights
the
united
states
had
a
right
to
proclaim
this
area
in
1949.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
well
the
decree
did
not
use
the
word
own.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
the
decree
said
--
it
now
has
and
exercises
paramount
rights
over
the
territory,
but
in
california
two
there
is
footnote
that
says
the
issue
in
california
one
was
whether
who
owned
the
three-mile
belt,
so
i
would
think
the
distinction
between
ownership
and
paramount
rights
is
at
most
a
technical
one.
i
will
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
california
argues
as
to
the
first
stage
of
dispute
that
the
whole
thing
is
really
a
problem
of
sloppy
graspmanship
and
that
the
president
truman
could
have
accomplished
everything
that
the
united
states
as
he
did
accomplish
had
he
only
done
it
a
little
more
carefully
and
that
as
i
understand
it
is
a
two
part
argument.
he
should
have
said,
according
to
california,
rocks,
waters,
islets,
submerged
lands
and
so
forth
instead
of
saying
just
areas.
well,
i
grant
you
had
he
said
that
we
perhaps
would
not
be
in
court
today.
we
say
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
well
on
that
respect
we
would
i
am
corrected.
we
--
the
united
states
has
contended
that
the
president
accomplished
the
same
thing
by
the
word
areas
and
i
don't
see
any
need
to
go
over
that.
the
second
part
of
california's
argument
on
this
point
is
that
the
1945
executive
order,
reserving
the
outer
continental
shelves,
was
not
revoked
by
implication
in
the
1949
proclamation
as
it
should
have
been.
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
to
consider
that
the
executive
order
of
1945
does
the
following
and
i
quote
from
the
order
itself,
as
to
the
outer
continental
shelf
it
is
“placed
under
the
jurisdiction
and
control
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
for
administrative
purposes
pending
the
enactment
of
legislation
in
regard
thereto”
and
there
it
stood
from
1945-1949.
in
1949,
two
square
miles
of
the
400,000
square
mile
outer
continental
shelf,
one
four
thousand
of
one
percent
is
conveyed
if
you
will
or
transferred
from
the
secretary
of
the
interior
back
to
the
president.
it
is
taken
out
of
that
category
in
which
it
was
in
as
a
result
of
the
45
degree
and
it
is
given
back
to
the
president
who
then
proclaims
it
to
be
a
national
monument.
now
to
call
this
a
revocation
by
implication
if
that's
the
test
then
that's
what
it
is.
regardless
of
what
one
calls
it
is
very
clear
that
the
land
went
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior
in
1945
as
part
of
the
outer
continental
shelf
and
two
square
miles
of
it
came
back
four
years
later.
there
is
no
problem
with
that.
there
is
no
necessity
for
the
1949
proclamation
to
say
we
revoke
one
four
thousand
of
one
percent
of
the
1945
proclamation.
that's
looking
for
things
that
shouldn't
be
there
in
the
first
place.
it's
a
very
simple
matter
that
the
land
went
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior
in
45
and
it
was
given
back,
transferred
back
four
years
later
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
and
then
three
miles
of
it
all
went
to
the
state.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
not
including
these
two
miles.
these
were
not
part
of
the
two
miles
that
went
to
the
state.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
because
of
the
claim
of
right,
because
they
were
specifically
accepted
in
section
5
(a)
by
virtue
of
the
claim
of
right.
yes.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
yes.
and
i
think
california's
argument
that
this
is
simply
--
that
the
1949
proclamation
was
simply
an
administrative
rearranging
of
the
department
of
interior's
land
is
just
not
so.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
the
second
part,
the
making
of
the
national
monument
is
the
critical
part
and
to
say
it's
simply
was
a
rearrangement
of
lands
is
only
half
the
story.
the
second
half
is
that
the
national
monument
was
made
out
of
it.
certainly
you
don't
need
a
presidential
proclamation
to
reclassify
land
in
the
interior
department
if
that's
all
that
was
being
done
there
was
no
need
for
presidential
proclamation.
the
proclamation
was
there
because
a
national
monument
was
to
be
made
out
of
it.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
absolutely.
yes.
there
is
for
example
in
16
u.s.c.
433
it
is
a
criminal
offense
to
molest
property
on
a
national
monument.
that
is
not
so
another
lands
on
by
the
interior
department.
so
this
had
a
--
the
making
of
a
national
monument
out
of
these
two
square
miles
was
much
more
then
simply
an
administrative
transfer
that
could
have
been
accomplished
by
a
memorandum
from
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
the
national
park
service.
i
think
as
far
as
the
second
part
of
the
argument,
the
claim
of
right
doctrine,
california
simply
reads
too
much
into
the
--
into
it
must
be
a
claim
of
right,
that
there
is
if
the
united
states,
if
the
congress
had
meant
to
follow
california's
interpretation
of
what
is
a
claim
of
right
it
would
have
simply
given
everything
back
to
the
states
and
demonstrably
it
didn't
intend
to
do
that.
in
section
5
(a)
of
the
act
there
were
several
categories
of
lands
and
territories,
and
waters
and
so
forth,
but
the
united
states
that
the
congress
wished
to
retain
for
the
united
states,
this
comes
into
one
of
those
and
i
don't
think
california
can
content
otherwise.
thank
you.
