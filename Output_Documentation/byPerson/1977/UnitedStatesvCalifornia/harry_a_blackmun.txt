justice
harry
a.
blackmun
does
that
mean
that
you
concede
that
there
was
no
claim
at
all
before
the
47
decision?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
the
us
had
no
claim
at
all
before
1947?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
is
the
entire
island?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
now
that
you
have
mentioned
high
water
mark,
somewhere
along
here
would
you
talk
about
tidelands?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
why?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
result
is
that
state
owns
the
tidelands
whereas
you
claim
the
islands
and
the
seabed
beyond
the
tidelands.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so,
we
have
a
little
horseshoe
ownership
of
the
states?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
may
that,
depending
on
tides
and
everything
else,
may
that
be
a
broadened
just
a
few
feet?
whatever
it
is
that
california
has?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
do
we
know
what
that
is?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yeah.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let
me
follow
through
on
justice
white's
suggestion
as
to
piers.
suppose
today
united
states
put
out
a
pier
from
one
these
islands,
on
your
theory
could
they
do
that?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
now
if
you
loose
this
case,
what
they
do?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
how
would
they
get
over
your
tidelands?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
they
couldn't?
