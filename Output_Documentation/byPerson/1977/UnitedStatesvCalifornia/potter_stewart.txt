justice
potter
stewart
at
the
time
of
president
truman’s
proclamation
referring
to
this
diagram,
the
–
this
was
the
identical
diagram
to
which
you
referred?
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
was
attached
or
made
a
part
of
the
proclamation?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
ownership
of
the
real-estate
is
what
you
are
talking
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
are
relying
on
the
proclamation,
proclamation
then
accept
the
tidelands.
justice
potter
stewart
president
roosevelt's
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
didn't
exclude
it.
justice
potter
stewart
well
your
reliance
in
this
case
as
i
understand
it
is,
you
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong,
exclusively
upon
the
president
roosevelt's
proclamation
and
president's
truman's
later
proclamation?
justice
potter
stewart
at
issue
here
as
president
truman's
proclamation.
well
i
don't
see,
why
you
don't
claim
the
tidelands
if
your
reliance
is
on
those
proclamations?
justice
potter
stewart
right,
that
is
the
result.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
so
you
are
relying
on
the
proclamation.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
why
do
you
concede
way
to
tidelands,
unless
you
are
relying
on
something
else?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
your
proposed
decree,
excluding
the
tidelands?
justice
potter
stewart
i
wonder
why
not?
justice
potter
stewart
not
what's
left
in
this
mile
is
a
matter
of
feet,
you
don't
mean
to
imply
that,
did
you?
justice
potter
stewart
which
is
simply
saying
a
measure
from
the
low
water
mark
of
the
shore
of
the
island?
justice
potter
stewart
but
somebody
knows
--
but
somebody
knows.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
fact.
justice
potter
stewart
the
reliance
by
the
government
in
this
case
is
on
the
proclamations.
justice
potter
stewart
and
absent
of
proclamation
as
a
general
rule;
you
--
california
owns
its
tidelands
along
the
shores
including
around
the
shores
of
the
islands
that
are
part
of
california,
but
the
whole
reliance
of
the
government
in
its
exercise
of
paramount
rights
over
both
these
islands
and
now
on
the
president
truman's
proclamation,
the
one-mile
belt
around
them
and
i
know
that's
a
basic
issue
in
this
case,
why
didn't
it
get
the
tidelands
under
the
proclamation?
justice
potter
stewart
you
didn't
in
fact
owned
--
you
had
turn
out
rights
to
them
under
--
justice
potter
stewart
now
--
i
think
--
i
would
have
thought,
under
president's
rule
about
original
proclamation
providing
that
these
islands
should
be
the
national
monuments,
the
islands
or
the
islands
down
to
the
shore?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
they
are
–
justice
potter
stewart
that's
our
terms
at
least
respect
to
santa
barbara.
justice
potter
stewart
through
decisions
of
this
court
–
justice
potter
stewart
yeah
but
you
--
you
put
a
great
big
but
before
in
there
and
it's
the
absence
of
that
but
for
on
which
the
government
relies
i.e
the
1947
decisions
in
the
first
california
case.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
government's
claim
of
right
doesn't
rest
only
derivatively
on
the
paramount
rights.
it
rests
directly
on
president
truman's
proclamation.
justice
potter
stewart
well
that
extension
of
the
authority
under
the
antiquity's
act
too,
isn't
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
talking
now
about
the
1953?
justice
potter
stewart
the
submerged
lands
act.
justice
potter
stewart
metamorphosis
--
justice
potter
stewart
because
of
the
claim
of
right.
justice
potter
stewart
because
of
the
statutory
language
excluding
claim
of
right?
justice
potter
stewart
the
question
in
this
case
arising
under
our
original
jurisdiction
is
whether
california
or
the
united
states
has
dominion
over
the
submerged
lands
and
waters
within
the
channel
islands
national
monument
which
is
situated
within
the
three
mile
marginal
sea
of
the
coast
of
southern
california.
for
the
reasons
set
out
in
detail
and
the
written
opinion
of
the
court
filed
with
the
clerk
this
morning,
we
hold
that
dominion
lies
with
california
and
not
the
united
states.
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
he
has
been
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
blackmun,
and
mr.
justice
marshall
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
