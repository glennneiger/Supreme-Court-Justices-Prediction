justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
how
the
government
acquired
the
islands
in
the
first
place
by
eminent
domain?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
was
true
in
pollard's
lessee
too,
all
the
land
was
in
the
possession
of
the
united
states
and
yet
this
court
held
that
the
united
states
alienated
the
land
could
not
alienate
the
tidal
water.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
did
president
truman
have
more
power
than
president
roosevelt
or
is
it
that
his
proclamation
is
more
express?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it's
the
lands
–
president
truman
used
broader
language
than
president
roosevelt?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
ryan
what
if
then
president
eisenhower,
after
the
submerged
lands
act,
it
passed
both
houses
of
congress,
feeling
that
he
didn't
really
like
the
act
but
knew
he
had
to
sign
it,
issued
a
proclamation
proclaiming
the
entire
three
miles
coastal
zone
a
national
monument
and
then
went
ahead
and
signed
the
tidelands
bill,
do
you
think
that
would
a
claim
of
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
when
you
say
there
must
be
statutory
authority
for
the
president
to
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
that
mean
both
the
united
states
must
have
had
title
and
the
president
authorized
to
make
a
proclamation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
i
mean
good
faith
--
at
least
good
faith
and
reasonable
belief
that
you
want,
doesn't
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
do
you
say
is
the
source
of
the
government's
claim
of
right
in
this
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
was
the
authority
for
him
to
make
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then
we
would
still
have
to
decide
that
question,
wouldn't
we,
the
claim
of
right
exception,
if
you
prevail
on
it
simply
leaves
you
where
you
were
with
respect
to
the
ability
of
president
truman's
proclamation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
–
what
if
the
united
states
owned
them?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
that
the
decision
in
california
specifically
reserved
the
question
of
ownership?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
was
stricken
out
of
the
decree.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
not
true
when
you're
simply
construing
a
deed
that's
a
deeding
land
rather
than
water,
is
it,
i
mean
–
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
when
you
--
when
you
say
the
surface
area
of
the
water
alone,
you
agree
don't
you
that
to
--
someone
the
surface
are
of
land
and
nothing
more
is
almost
meaningless.
i
mean
you
can't
pass
6
inch
furl
in
the
land,
it
doesn't
do
very
much
good
and
most
in
deeds
convey
mineral
rights
unless
they're
accepted?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
but
isn't
one
of
the
least
reasonable
construction
is
the
idea
that
he
intended
to
reserve
kind
of
a
film
of
water
mile
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
it
doesn't
withstand
what
you
call
the
test
of
the
antiquity's
act,
all
that
means
is
the
president
didn't
have
the
authority
to
put
it
in
a
national
monument,
it
doesn't
mean
that
the
government
no
longer
owns
it
or
it
had
a
claim
of
right,
does
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
let
me
ask
you,
do
you
think
under
the
antiquity's
act
the
president
could
proclaim
all
the
incorporated
area
with
in
the
city
of
santa
barbara
as
a
national
monument
because
of
--
the
early
fryers
and
so
forth
even
though
the
land
was
owned
by
private
citizens?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
can
profit
though
from
any
imperfections
in
these
presidential
proclamations
based
on
the
antiquity's
act
since
as
i
understand
the
antiquity's
act
it's
only
purpose
is
congress
says
with
respect
to
this
kind
of
land
at
the
united
states
owns
or
controls,
the
president
may
make
a
national
monument
of
it.
now
supposing
he
didn't
succeed
in
making
a
national
monument
wouldn't
that
--
the
united
states
would
still
own
or
control
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
a
proclamation
is
basically
a
reservation
of
land
that
the
government
already
owns
transferring
it
out
of
category
to
a
national
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
why
then
the
--
why
then
the
california
stipulate
that
this
land
was
--
actually
occupied
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
give
away
one
part
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
don't
you
hold
on
to
both
parts
in
your
case
and
litigate
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
said
yourself
a
minute
ago
i
thought
it
was
that
it
was
that
it
was
just
transfer
from
department
of
interior
to
the
president
and
then
he
made
a
national
monument
of
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
assumption
was
quite
apart
from
language
of
proclamation
the
united
states
owned
or
controlled
that
land?
