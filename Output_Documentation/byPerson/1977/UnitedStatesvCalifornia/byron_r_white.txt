justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
--
i
take
it
that
if
47
case
had
come
out
the
other
way
you
would
say
you
had
no
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
couldn't
have
been
any
national
monument
setup
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
immediately
after
--
immediately
after
the
submerged--
immediately
before
the
submerged
lands
act
while
the
47
decision
was
still
ruling
the
waves,
what
was
the
difference
between
united
states
claim
with
respect
to
the
sea
bed
underlying
the
national
monument
and
the
adjourning
sea
bed?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
if
there
was
no
–
if
there
was
no
--
i
guess
you
were
just
going
to
tell
me
then
why
the
submerged
land
act
didn't
treat
both
pieces
of
the
sea
bed
the
same?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
both
areas
would
be
under
claim
of
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
you
know
this
case
can't
do
anymore
than
claim
to
own
what
it
owns?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
except
to
that
decision,
you
just
said
if
the
decision
come
out
the
other
way,
they
wouldn't
have
owned
the
national
monument
either?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
understand
that
if
the
tidelands
maybe
inland
waters
of
the
state
if
the
state
happens
to
own
shore
next
to
it,
but
state
at
time
of
the
proclamation
didn't
own
the
shore
and
never
has,
doesn't
yet
own
these
islands?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
maybe
so
but
the
land
is
the
united
states
territory,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
maybe
so
but
as
my
brother
stewart
says
the
proclamation
–
justice
byron
r.
white
--
didn't
say
a
word
about
tideland?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
that
proclamation
could
not
purport
to
take
the
–
justice
byron
r.
white
--
legally
and
constitutionally
could
not
take
the
tidelands?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
he
had
said
the
areas
including
the
tidelands
you
would
have
said
that
he
didn't
have
power
to
include
the
tideland?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
think
that
the
reservation
intended
to
reserve
the
united
states
the
right
to
conserve
the
sea
life
that
lives
on
the
bottom?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
let's
put
it
this
way,
under
that's
--
if
you
assume
that
--
that
the
proclamation
was
intended
to
--
to
reserve
the
water,
i
suppose
the
united
states
controlled
the
sea
life
in
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
wow
about
the
ones
living
on
the
bottom?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
you
are
not
–
one
of
the
build
appears
or
something
out
from
the
land
they
would
be
trespassing?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
had
--
would
have
no
right
to
have
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
under
water
under
your
submission?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
that
–
and
it
could
have
--
do
you
say
that
the
–
aside
form
that
would
you
say
that
the
antiquity's
act
authorized
the
president
to
reserve
the
sea
bed
beyond
the
tidelands
if
had
said
so
expressly?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
antiquity's
act
would
have
authorized
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
expressly
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
don't
you
tell
us
how
you
interpret
the
claim
of
right
in
the
submerged
lands
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
the
government
had
--
there
were
piers
built
out
from
these
islands
far
out
into
the
–
far
out
and
all
past
the
sea
bed
and
there
were
a
100
offshore
oil
platforms
operating
with
in
the
one
mile
zone
under
leases
from
the
united
states
–
the
1953
reservation
wouldn't
have
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
that
--
you
don't
think
that
--
a
presidential
occupation
expressly
reserved
in
the
sea
bed
would
have
been
a
reservation
for
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
in
the
situation
in
1949,
the
government,
the
government
had
until
to
1953
it
was
the
government's
underwater
sea
bed.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
sort
of
the
same
way
california
got
the
tidelands
–
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
say
that
1953
submerged
land
act
would
nevertheless
run
you
in
lot
of
courts?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
three
miles
of
it
all
went
to
the
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
including
these
two
miles?
