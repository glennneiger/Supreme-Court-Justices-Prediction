mr.
russell
iungerich
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
first
like
to
briefly
address
the
question
of
tidelands
in
this
case.
california
bases
it's
ownership
of
tidelands
on
the
basic
doctrine
enunciated
first
in
pollard's
lessee
versus
hagan
and
followed
most
recently
in
the
oregon
versus
corvallis
sand
&
gravel
case
and
that
is
by
virtue
of
the
equal
footing
doctrine,
by
virtue
of
our
sovereignty,
we
receive
title
to
all
--
ownership
of
all
tidelands
within
our
political
boundaries
and
since
our
political
boundaries
included
not
only
the
mainland,
the
coast
of
the
mainland
out
to
water
but
also
the
islands
offshore
which
were
within
our
political
jurisdiction.
the
tidelands
around
those
islands
are
also
owned
by
the
state
of
california
and
not
the
united
states
as
we
originally
claimed
in
this
proceeding.
mr.
russell
iungerich
yes.
mr.
russell
iungerich
we
didn't
get
the
tidelands
because
we
own
them
and
because
the
antiquities
act
of
1906
is
that
you
can
only
place
international
monument
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
well
i
think
it
was
more
than
that
as
far
as
the
decision
in
1947
and
in
later
cases
point
out.
that
point
--
the
point
that
was
made
is
that
we
did
have
rights
with
respect
to
the
tidelands
that
i
think
were
broader
than
the
rights
that
the
federal
government
received
in
1947
in
the
one
mile
belt
and
that
those
rights
were
historic
rights
that
even
the
federal
government
recognized
and
did
not
contest
in
the
1947
decision.
mr.
russell
iungerich
well
if
you
take
a
close
look
at
the
1938
proclamation
of
president
roosevelt
and
look
at
the
calls
of
the
island
that
are
set
forth
for
santa
barbara
island,
the
cause
are
only
to
the
high
water
mark
–
mr.
russell
iungerich
--
recognizing
only
with
regard
to
santa
barbara
island,
federal
ownership
down
to
the
high
water
mark
and
apparently
recognizing
our
ownership
of
tidelands
at
that
point
in
time.
there
is
no
mention
specifically
with
regard
to
anacapa
island
but
there
is
that
specific
call
in
the
santa
barbara
island
portion
out
of
the
description
in
38.
mr.
russell
iungerich
yes.
so
at
least
as
far
as
the
tidelands
are
concerted,
we
think
that
we
should
have
decree
affirmatively
stating
that
california
owns
those
tidelands
and
that
clearly
specifying
what
the
shoreline
of
anacapa
island
is?
the
united
states
proposed
supplemental
decree
would
nearly
exclude
them
from
the
proclamation
and
not
affirmatively
state
that
california
has
its
right
adjudicated
by
this
court
and
the
fact
we
have
the
right
to
administer
those
tidelands
and
exercise
jurisdiction
over
them.
now
that
does
present
if
the
federal
position
prevails
this
problem
of
what
appear
to
be
concentric
realms
and
we
submit
that
the
interpretation
of
the
1949
proclamation
which
the
government
presents
here
is
an
erroneous
interpretation
of
that
proclamation
and
as
a
matter
of
law
the
proclamation
must
be
construed
as
not
to
have
added
either
the
submerged
lands
of
the
one-mile
belt
around
each
of
the
two
islands
or
the
waters
of
the
pacific
ocean
that
are
above
those
submerged
lands
and
we
submit
that
that
follows
for
the
following
reasons.
first
of
all
if
we
examine
the
use
of
the
word
“areas,”
the
preamble
to
the
proclamation
which
normally
we
would
refer
to,
to
discover
the
intent
of
the
president
or
in
a
case
of
a
statute
the
intent
of
congress,
only
refers
to
the
islets
and
rocks
that
are
located
in
the
one-mile
belt
and
then
it
at
a
later
point
in
the
--
in
the
preamble
there
is
a
reference
to
the
areas
here
in
after
described,
very
–
and
making
it
very
unclear
what
those
areas
will
be.
the
use
of
the
word
“areas”
as
we
analyze
the
definition
of
the
word
“areas”
normally
connotes
surface
or
is
a
term
of
surface
reference,
another
word
“a
two
dimensional
reference”
which
in
it's
normal
usage
would
only
include
the
surface
of
the
waters.
indeed
there
is
one
document
that's
cited
in
the
federal
government's
brief,
which
the
specifically
indicates
an
intent
on
the
part
of
the
national
park
service
to
add
only
waters
and
i
refer
to
the
u.s.
brief
at
page
15
and
their
reference
to
join
a
appendix
page
13,
a
park
service
memorandum
that
suggests
the
addition
of
surface
areas
only.
now
if
that's
the
case,
we're
looking
here
at
the
possibility
of
only
adding
the
surface
areas
of
the
water.
mr.
russell
iungerich
this
--
justice
rehnquist
it
all
--
i
think
the
whole
continuity,
all
of
the
factors
in
the
matter
of
interpretation
have
to
be
taken
into
account.
we
look
at
this
one
isolated
factor.
i'd
have
to
concede
that
it
might
be
equivocal
one
way
or
another.
i
think
over
--
looking
over
the
entire
proclamation
with
all
the
factors
that
i
plan
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention
and
which
we
have
brought
to
the
court's
attention
in
the
brief,
we
really
can't
tell
what
areas
was
really
intended
to
cover,
but
one
thing
i
can
say
and
one
thing
the
federal
government
has
not
brought
out
in
it's
briefs
or
here
in
it's
oral
argument
is
the
fact
that
throughout
the
executive
history,
throughout
any
--
throughout
the
language
of
either
the
38
proclamation
or
the
1949
proclamation
there
is
not
one
reference
to
the
term
submerged
lands
as
being
intended
to
be
added
to
this
national
monument.
there
is
not
one
reference
and
they
can
sight
no
where
to
the
record
to
a
reference
to
submerged
lands.
we
submit
that
what
they
we're
concerned
about
is
protecting
the
marine
life
that
was
out
in
the
water
next
to
these
islands.
and
as
we
make
the
point,
in
executive
order
9633
in
1945.
president
truman
had
already
reserved
the
submerged
lands
of
the
continental
shelf
for
future
to
legislation
so
that
they
couldn't
have
been
added
to
this
monument
unless
there
was
a
repeal
by
implication
of
the
1945
proclamation
and
that's
a
point
that
the
united
states
does
not
answer.
there
has
to
have
been
that
revocation
by
implication
and
that
revocation
by
implication
can
not
stand
here
because
the
information
taken
out
from
the
language
out
of
the
proclamation,
the
information
that
we
have
from
the
executive
history,
points
in
many
directions,
but
it
does
not
support
any
claim
to
submerged
lands
being
added
to
the
--
to
the
monument
in
1949
and
i
think
that's
the
relevant
point
here.
it
suggests
at
most
while
it
clearly
adds
the
rocks
and
islets
within
the
one-mile
belt
because
their
names
are
specifically
in
the
proclamation
and
it
may
add
the
surface
areas
of
the
water
and
some
rights
in
the
water
areas
but
we
submit
under
the
antiquity's
act,
the
waters
is
alone
could
not
have
been
added
to
the
monument
in
and
off
themselves
without
submerged
lands
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
well
the
problem
here
is
we
have
an
in
artful
description
and
it's
not
clear
what's
meant
and
i
don't
necessarily
rely
on
surface
area
but
i'm
just
trying
to
find
out,
basically
grapple
with
what
president
truman
intended.
mr.
russell
iungerich
i
think
most
--
it
wouldn't
be
film
of
water,
it
would
have
to
be
the
bulk
of
the
water
but
not
the
yellow
line
sea
bed
-
mr.
russell
iungerich
but
what
the
problem
is
that
the
land
has
to
be
expressly
placed
in
the
monument
and
not
the
water
alone.
in
other
words
the
antiquity's
act
of
1906
says
that
government
can
only
add
the
land
owned
or
controlled
by
the
government
of
the
united
states
to
a
national
monument.
examining
the
secretary
of
interior's
letter
to
the
president,
he
said,
he
wanted
to
add
the
rocks
islets
and
waters
within
one
nautical
mile
that
was
subsequently
changed
to
areas
but
there
is
not
indication
that
submerged
lands
were
intended
to
added.
mr.
russell
iungerich
no
it
does
not
intend
to
reserve
--
the
proclamation
as
i
see
it
is
not
intended
to
protect
sea
life
because
assistant
solicitor
general
washington
wrote
the
memo
that
ultimately
went
to
the
attorney
general
and
was
then
sent
to
the
president
recommending
approval
of
this
proclamation
specifically
disavowed
any
intention
to
protect
marine
life.
mr.
russell
iungerich
yes.
mr.
russell
iungerich
well
i
don't
know
how
we
divide
that
up
and
i
think
the
simple
answer
to
that
is
it's
very
difficult
to
grapple
with
that,
the
actual
intent
of
the
president
in
this
case
because
it's
very
hard
to
deal
with
those
terms.
i
think
the
way
to
resolve
this
problem
is
the
way
that
california
has
suggested
and
that
is
simply
this
-
mr.
russell
iungerich
yes.
mr.
russell
iungerich
that
would
be
anything
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
yes,
but
what
i'm
--
what
i'm
submitting
here
is
that
the
reason
the
probable
reason
way
this
term
waters
and
the
word
area
was
used
was
the
fact
that
in
1945
there
had
already
been
a
reservation
in
executive
order
9633
of
this
natural
resources
of
the
subsoil
on
sea
bed
of
the
continental
shelf
which
reserve
those
lands
for
legislation
being
aware
of
that
and
the
department
of
interior
they
wanted
expressly
to
avoid
the
possibility
of
taking
some
lands
out
of
that
reservation
and
placing
them
in
the
national
monument,
and
so
they
carefully
tried
to
draft
a
proclamation
that
avoided
that
result
and
the
end
result
is
a
proclamation
that
will
not
stand
the
test
of
the
antiquity's
act
because
it
didn't
add
the
submerged
lands
underneath,
because
there
has
been
the
repeal
–
mr.
russell
iungerich
if
they
didn't
--
if
the
government
didn't
own
it
--
it
not
--
it
does
not
have
a
claim
of
right.
mr.
russell
iungerich
no
he
can
not.
it
states
that
the
land
must
either
be
owned
or
controlled
by
the
united
states
and
that
means
that
we
either
have
to
have
some
type
of
public
domain
land
or
we
have
to
have
a
type
of
land
that
has
been
--
is
under
the
control
of
the
united
states,
such
as
the
question
of
title
was
left
in
the
doubt
in
the
1947
u.s.
versus
california
decision
and
the
federal
government
was
awarded
paramount
rights
in
full
dominion
over
their
natural
resources
and
subsurface
but
under
those
circumstances
what
we
have
there
is
the
government
controlling
those
lands
in
the
sense
that
it
had
very
broad
rights
but
if
the
federal
government
does
not
own
lands
or
does
not
control
them
i
submit
the
antiquity's
act
says
that
the
president
does
not
have
any
authority
of
any
type
to
put
those
lands
in
any
kind
of
reservation
and
i
think
that's
the
clear
statement
of
what
congress
meant
in
analyzing
the
legislative
history
of
the
antiquity's
act
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
yes
it
was
because
those
islands
were
ceded
to
the
united
states
under
the
treaty
of
guadalupe
hidalgo
from
mexico
and
as
a
result
based
on
that
they
were
public
domain
lands
and
being
public
domain
lands
the
united
states
could
place
them
in
a
national
monument
down
to
the
high
watermark,
but
they
couldn't
place
out
tidelands
in
there
because
by
virtue
of
our
sovereignty
in
1850
the
treaty
of
guadalupe
hidalgo
was
in
1848
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
excuse
me,
yes
if
we
had
said
so
expressly
in
1949,
he
could
have
reserved
the
submerged
lands
in
that
one
mile
belt.
mr.
russell
iungerich
yes,
the
point
is
it's
unclear
whether
he
did
that
because
he
had
already
reserved
those
lands
in
executive
order
9633
and
this
order
can
be
can
be
construed
in
such
a
way
as
that
--
as
not
repealing
by
implication
executive
order
9633
and
giving
the
national
park
service
jurisdiction
over
everything
that's
in
the
water
and
still
reserving
under
9633
the
submerge
lands
for
purposes
of
national
--
national
resource
development.
mr.
russell
iungerich
no
it
wouldn't
because
in
1953
and
that's
my
next
point,
in
1953
the
submerged
lands
act
relinquished
to
california
all
federal
rights
in
the
entire
three-mile
belt
and
our
point
is
that
this
is
not
a
valid
claim
of
right
that
was
preserved
by
section
5
and
the
claim
of
right
exception
in
the
submerged
lands
act
and
i
think
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
based
on
the
interpretation
of
the
proclamation?
mr.
russell
iungerich
yes
because
the
reason
is
if
they
had
put
the
submerged
lands
in
to
the
--
into
the
monument
in
1949
–
mr.
russell
iungerich
expressly
–
mr.
russell
iungerich
they
had
the
power
expressly
–
mr.
russell
iungerich
they
had
the
power
to
do
that
but
our
point
is
that
that's
the
claim
of
right
resting
solely
upon
the
paramount
rights
doctrine
of
the
47
decision.
mr.
russell
iungerich
well
presidential
proclamation
is
simply
a
reservation.
that
proclamation
is
not
a
claim
of
right.
the
antecedent
claim
of
right
to
piece
of
property
is
the
source
of
the
federal
government's
title
or
it's
source
of
control
of
that
property.
it's
the
antecedent
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
well
i
would
submit
that
the
--
the
clear
indication
here
is
that,
when
we're
talking
about
claim
of
right,
if
we
look
at
the
legislative
history
which
california
has
set
fourth
in
detail
in
it's
brief,
the
purpose
of
this
was
to
not
preserve
reservation
of
this
language.
it
was
a
savings
clause
that
if
there
was
an
implied
claim
that
might
later
be
brought
up
in
court
or
a
claim
that
was
pending
in
court
that
the
united
states
had,
the
broad
language
of
the
submerged
lands
act
would
have
made
that
land
pass
back
to
california
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
they
were
expressly
recovered
by
another
exception
your
honor.
they
were
covered
by
all
lands
filled
in,
built
up
and
otherwise
reclaimed
by
the
united
states
for
its
own
use
and
they
did
not
--
were
not
encompassed
within
--
they
we're
expressly
thought
of
and
were
not
encompassed
in
the
actual
occupancy
under
claim
of
right
exception.
mr.
russell
iungerich
in
answer
that
i
question
your
honor,
suppose
the
president
tomorrow
walked
in
to
your
home
and
announced
i
proclaim
this
as
a
national
monument,
would
he
have
a
claim
of
right
to
that
property?
mr.
russell
iungerich
well
how
did
the
government
get
the
title
to
that
underwater
sea
bed
or
whatever
right
it
had,
it's
right
to
control,
it
was
in
the
1947
decision
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
but
we
got
them
by
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
yes,
yes.
mr.
russell
iungerich
they'd
have
to
have
to
obtain
--
our
theory
is
that
we
own
that
particular
until
it's
adjudicated
–
mr.
russell
iungerich
well
if
we
loose
this
case
then
you'll
adjudicating
that
they
own
the
submerged
lands
and
they
could
put
out
a
pier.
mr.
russell
iungerich
well
i
think
they'd
have
to
get
a
permit
to
cross
our
tidelands
mr.
russell
iungerich
well,
i
am
not
saying
that
california
wouldn't
exercise
the
jurisdiction
to
allow
them
a
permit
to
cross
our
tidelands
but
yes
there
is
that
intervening
area
and
they
would
have
to
resolve
that
with
the
state
of
california
and
clearly
own
those
tidelands
and
it
--
and
basically
what
is
happened
here
is
that
we
have
a
situation
that
is
probably
an
exception
to
all
of
the
uniform
rule
that
mariners
can
rely
on,
the
governments
can
rely
on
that
the
states
at
the
present
time
are
the
agencies
that
have
jurisdiction
over
the
three-mile
belt
except
around
anacapa
and
santa
barbara
island
and
possibly
for
jefferson
national
monument
in
the
dry
tortugas
in
florida.
but
those
are
the
exceptional
situations
where
the
federal
government
is
claimed
is
prior
to
1953
in
area,
but
i
submit
a
reservation
is
not
a
claim
of
right.
a
proclaim
--
a
presidential
proclamation
is
not
acclaim
of
right
in
on
of
itself.
it's
merely
statement
by
the
president
that
i
think
under
the
antiquity's
act
the
federal
government
owns
or
controls
this
property
and
it's
merely
an
assertion
of
that
by
the
president
of
the
united
states.
it
does
not
create
a
good
point
right
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
well
a
claim
of
right
must
have
a
basis
and
the
basis
here
is
the
paramount
rights
decision
in
1949.
there
is
no
basis.
i
mean
a
reservation
is
simply
a
mechanical
feature
that's
used
within
the
department
of
interior
to
transfer
normally
public
domain
lands
from
the
general
category
where
their
entry
and
sale
is
allowed
over
to
a
special
category
where
they
are
administered
for
special
purposes.
but
i
don't
believe
that
a
reservation
metamorphosis
a
claim
of
right
based
on
the
paramount
rights
doctrine
into
acclaim
of
right
of
some
other
nature,
to
--
in
the
style
of
gertrude
stien
a
reservation
is
a
reservation
is
reservation
but
not
a
claim
of
right
and
that's
the
basic
point
i'm
making.
as
far
as
this
particular
area,
there
was
a
reservation
here
in
1949,
but
--
but
for
the
1947
decision,
the
federal
government
had
no
claim
that
it
had
to
right
own
or
to
control
the
submerged
lands
in
the
one
mile
belt.
without
the
submerged
lands
it
has
no
right
to
control
the
super
jason
waters
because
the
antiquity's
act
does
not
have
the
super
jason
-
does
not
allow
addition
of
waters
in
and
of
themselves.
it
says
expressly
it
must
be
lands
that
are
added
and
then
if
we
have
any
implied
rights
those
rights
are
to
waters.
what
the
federal
government
does
is
turn
that
on
its
head
and
says
well
we
reserve
the
waters
and
therefore
we
ought
to
get
the
submerged
lands.
mr.
russell
iungerich
well
if
--
but
the
senate
reports
expressly
states
with
regard
to
the
claim
of
right
exception
that
there
is
not
a
good
claim
of
right
when
that
claim
of
right
rests
solely
upon
the
doctrine
of
paramount
rights
and
i
submit
that
we
don't
want
to
the
reservation
we
look
to
the
way
in
which
the
federal
government
owned
or
control
bad
land,
the
reason
why
it
owned
control
that
land
as
being
claim
of
right.
that
is
my
--
the
basic
point
and
the
basic
point
of
difference
with
the
united
states.
we
submit
that
if
you
look
at
the
language
of
the
active
--
antiquity's
act
and
the
reason
why
the
government
owned
or
controlled
it
that
reason
is
the
--
paramount
rights
doctrine
of
the
47
california
decision
and
in
light
of
that
the
requirement
has
to
be
that
it's
not
a
good
point
of
right
because
it
rests
solely
on
the
paramount
rights
document.
mr.
russell
iungerich
but
i
don't
see
a
pro
--
a
proclamation
as
being
a
claim
of
right
in
any
sense.
i'm
afraid
that's
the
difference.
mr.
russell
iungerich
well
that's
--
that's
what
the
proclamation
says
--
i
--
let
me
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
that
is
the
statement
of
president
truman.
he
says,
he
does
proclaim
the
areas
within
one
nautical
mile
are
with
drawn
from
all
forms
of
appropriation
and
are
reserved
as
part
of
the
channel
islands
national
monument.
now
the
proclamation
in
and
of
itself
doesn't
do
anything.
it
just
reserves
those
lands
and
it
takes
them
out
of
the
area
where
they
can
be
appropriated
under
public
land
laws
and
it
puts
them
into
the
national
monument
category.
it's
not
a
claim
of
right
in
and
of
itself.
what
we're
talking
about
is
a
claim
of
right
where
we're
--
the
federal
government
has
some
claim
that
it
owns
or
controls
this
land.
this
isn't
a
claim
that
it
owns
or
controls
the
land.
this
is
merely
a
statement
that's
transferring
it
from
one
category
to
another,
and
i
think
that
that's
the
critical
point.
mr.
russell
iungerich
yes
i
think
that's
--
i
think
that
would
be
a
fair
statement
because
that
what
the
legislative
history,
the
senate
report
says
that
we
in
effect
are
not
allowing
a
claim
of
right
based
solely
on
the
paramount
rights
doctrine
--
and
in
fact
it
seems
to
be
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
the
1953
act
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
yes
and
the
claim
of
right
language
that
is
contain
within
sections
5
of
that
act.
mr.
russell
iungerich
that's
correct
and
i
would
submit
as
well
in
analyzing
the
legislative
history
of
the
proclamation
that
the
essence
of
what
was
--
what
was
intended
by
the
actual
occupancy
under
claim
of
right
exception
was
the
situation
where
the
federal
government
had
a
claim
and
litigation
or
a
claim
that
may
have
been
brought
in
litigation
and
if
that
language
had
not
been
placed
in
section
5,
all
of
those
claims
either
good
or
bad
would
have
passed
to
california
and
federal
rights
would
have
been
relinquished.
mr.
russell
iungerich
we'll
not
answer
why
admit
the
actually
occupied
because
we
don't
think
that
they've
got
a
good
claim
of
right
and
therefore
there
are
two
parts
to
the
language.
we
submit
–
mr.
russell
iungerich
--
we
give
away
one
part
but
we
don't
give
away
the
claim
of
right
part.
mr.
russell
iungerich
because
that
would
have
involved
an
extensive
factual
issue
and
i
think
probably
that
the
federal
government
would
have
prevailed
on
that
issue
and
that
was
a
attachable
judgment.
in
conclusion
california
submits
that
first
with
regard
to
the
interpretation
of
the
proclamation,
we
have
a
concession
on
the
part
of
the
federal
government
that
both
the
language
of
the
proclamation
does
not
cover
the
tidelands
and
that
under
those
circumstances
california
submits
that
it
is
entitled
to
an
affirmative
decree
such
as
it
proposes,
recognizing
it's
rights
on
those
tidelands
and
not
really
excluding
the
tidelands
as
the
federal
government
does
from
it's
decree.
we
also
submit
that
the
interpretation
of
the
1949
proclamation
should
be
such
that
it
should
indicate
that
the
submerged
lands
have
been
placed
in
executive
order
9633
in
1945
and
therefore
since
there
is
an
ambiguity
as
to
what
was
actually
placed,
in
1949
in
the
channel
islands
national
monument
by
the
enlargement
of
-
without
a
repeal
by
implication
of
the
45
proclamation
as
a
matter
of
law
and
by
a
established
cannons
of
statutory
construction
applied
in
this
case
to
a
proclamation
there
should
be
determination
as
a
matter
of
law
that
this
proclamation
is
interpreted
as
non
including
submerged
lands.
if
it
doesn't
include
submerged
lands
our
argument
is
that
waters
alone
could
not
have
been
added
just
the
waters
above
the
submerged
lands
because
the
antiquity's
act
only
permits
the
addition
of
lands
owned
or
controlled
by
the
government
of
the
united
states
and
it's
doesn't
allow
the
reservation
of
waters
per
se
without
lands
beneath
them
or
without
lands
adjacent
to
them
having
been
placed
within
the
national
monument.
we
further
submit
that
as
to
the
claim
of
right
exception,
the
basic
point
here
again
and
i
emphasize
that
is
that
we
look
to
the
claim
of
right
as
being
the
underling
claim
that
the
federal
government
has
that
it
owned
or
controlled
those
lands
in
1945
and
again
we
submit
that
the
claim
of
right
is
not
a
reservation
in
and
off
itself
because
it
--
a
proclamation
such
as
this,
works
no
magic.
it
doesn't
improve
the
quality
of
the
federal
government's
title
it
doesn't
make
the
federal
government
own
something
that
it
does
not
own
and
it
does
not
take
a
reservation
that
was
based
solely
on
the
fact
that
the
federal
government
was
adjudicated
in
1949
to
own
in
one
sense
or
control
in
another
sense
the
submerged
lands
of
the
one
mile
belt
and
metaphors
-
have
a
work
in
metamorphosis
of
that
claim
into
something
that
is
separate
and
apart
from
the
paramount
rights
doctrine.
and
i
think
that's
the
--
the
fundamental
point
at
least
as
far
as
our
case
on
either
of
these
two
points
i
think
that
the
decree
proposed
by
california
should
be
adopted
by
this
court
and
that
judgment
should
be
in
favor
of
the
state
of
california
with
respect
to
this
decree.
