justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
your
argument
as
it
includes
the
argument
that
whatever
might
have
been
true
when
the
statute
was
first
passed
at
least
now,
it
should
be
construed
the
way
you
suggest
it
should
be
that
congress
is
actually
approved
this
interpretation
by
the
commission,
it
says,
though
it
were
now
written
that
the
commission
may
enter
successive
suspensions
for
ten
day
periods,
if
yet
at
the
end
of
maximum
appropriate
determination.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
challenge,
i
think
that
you
challenge
solely
the
right
of
sec
to
issue
more
than
one
suspension.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
why
do
you
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
there
had
been,
what
if
there
had
been.
i
thought
your
view
was
that
without
a
hearing
or
without
some
further
proceeding
they
just
could
not
grant
more
than
one
10-day
suspension.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
held,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
it
was
the
same
old
thing?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
answer
to
justice
stevens
is
that,
that
under
the
statute
there
just
is
not
any
remedy
provided
to
suspend
the
trading
in
the
security
for
more
than
ten
days
even
with
the
hearing.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
with
the
hearing.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
am
--
that
is
true
about
non
registered
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now
by
answering
my
brother
stevens'
question
then
what
should
the
sec
have
done
here
with
respect
to
a
registered
security,
started
a
new
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
after
notice
and
hearing.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
again
the
ten
days
issue
had
gone
under
12.
