justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
there
is
any
limited
all
to
the
number
of
times
the
commission
can
consecutively
exercise
its
ten
days
suspension?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
think
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
would
that
fall?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
on
the
same
set
of
facts,
court
would
be
justified
and
setting
aside
that
20
consecutive
suspension,
whereas
it
would
not
be
set
for
second
suspension?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
supposing
that
review
was
sought
after
the
second
consecutive
ten
days
suspension,
and
the
court
concludes
no
abusive
discretion,
there
are
then
18
more
successive
ten
days
suspensions
and
review
was
again
sought
in
the
court,
would
the
same
court
be
justified
and
concluding
that
there
was
an
abusive
discretion
simply
by
the
number
of
successive
suspensions?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can
go
and
then
get
a
preliminary
injunction,
can't
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
your
hypothesis
is
that
having
failed
to
do
that
you
can
similarly
suspend
for
180
days
without
any
evidance?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
commission
unambiguously
and
fairly
explained
to
congress
its
present
policy
in
1964?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
suggesting
that
average
(inaudible)
reads
your
annual
report?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no
that
does
not
constitute
our
congressional
approval,
does
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
an
approval
by
an
oversight
committee
in
1959
certainly
does
not
represent
an
active
congress.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
that
an
adequate
presentation
of
this
policy
was
made
to
the
1964
congress
that
did
enact
the
bill.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
weinstein
agaisnt
bradford
we
said
it
had
to
be
capable
of
a
repetition
with
respect
to
the
particular
parties
involved.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that
therefore
it
is
or
is
not
moot.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
gives
to
this
particular
respondent?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
doesn't
weinstein
versus
bradford
say,
it
has
to
capable
of
repetition
with
respect
to
each
of
the
parties?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
your
contention
then
mr.
sloan
that
the
sec
relied
on
a
number
of
factors
in
issuing
its
lifetime
bar
order
against
you
and
one
of
them
was
this
10-day
order
and
therefore
it
is
at
least
conceivable
that
if
this
10-day
order
were
found
to
be
invalid
they
might
not
have
entered
the
same
lifetime
bar
order
against
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
tie
in
between
the
10-day
suspension
and
the
net
capital
deduction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
an
argument
against
mootness?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
may
i
suggest
that
if
the
time
was
granted,
you
might
get
on
to
the
merits.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
concede
there
or
don't
you
that
there
are
circumstances
under
which
they
would
issue
more
than
one
10-day
inconsecutive
suspension?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
if
they
want
another
one,
they
have
to
give
notice
and
hearing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
all
of
their
authority
under
(4)
is
exhausted
at
one
suspension.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
first
of
this
trio
is
number
76-1607,
securities
and
exchange
commission
against
sloan.
the
securities
and
exchange
act
of
1934
empowers
the
commission
to
summarily
suspend
trading
in
any
security
for
a
period
not
exceeding
10
days
if
in
it's
opinion
the
public
interest
and
the
protection
of
investors
so
require.
acting
under
this
authority,
the
commission
twice
issued
a
series
of
consecutive
10-day
order,
suspending
trading
in
the
common
stock
of
a
corporation
for
over
a
year
each
time.
respondent,
sloan
who
owns
stock
in
that
corporation
challenged
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit,
the
commission's
statutory
authority
to
issue
these
consecutive
summary
suspension
orders.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
respondent
sloan
and
held
that
the
commission
was
not
empowered
by
congress
to
issue
successive
orders
to
curtail
trading
in
the
security
for
a
period
beyond
the
initial
10-day
period.
we
granted
certiorari
at
the
request
of
the
commission.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
under
the
act,
the
commission
does
not
have
the
authority
based
upon
a
single
set
of
circumstances
to
issue
a
series
of
summary
orders
that
would
suspend
trading
and
the
security
beyond
the
initial
10-day
period,
even
though
the
commission
periodically
redetermines
that
such
action
is
required
by
the
public
interest
and
for
protection
of
investors.
mr.
justice
brennan
joined
by
mr.
justice
marshall
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
also
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
