unknown
speaker
you
do
not
need
to
make
that
argument
if
your
first
was
--
unknown
speaker
that
is
correct,
we
would
not
be.
unknown
speaker
but
this
respondent
has
filed
an
affidavit
or
it
claims
that
he
owns
what
some
400
different
securities.
unknown
speaker
and
the
commission
suspends
what
20
or
30
different
securities
each
year?
unknown
speaker
and
has
done
so
every
year
as
a
matter
for
historic
fact.
unknown
speaker
because
of
the
procedure
that
he
followed
--
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
sloan
what
was
the
present
status
of
the
bar
against
your--
is
that
involved
in
some
litigation?
unknown
speaker
but,
have
you
attacked
anywhere
this
bar
against
your
engaging
in
the
securities
business?
unknown
speaker
well,
does
a
challenge
to
the
validity
of
that
order
is
whether
or
not
there
shall
be
one
which
will
or
will
not
turn
on
the
result
of
this
case?
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
why
you
suggest
there
is
no
mootness.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
is
not
the
issue
of
that
order
close
matter,
you
did
not
bring,
you
have
not
brought
that
case
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
so
it
is
over.
unknown
speaker
was
this
an
argument
that
the
statute
authorizes
only
one
single
10-day
suspension?
unknown
speaker
now,
mr.
sloan
do
you
concede
that
the
sec
would
have
power
under
12
(k)
to
issue
a
10-day
suspension
of
trading,
let
us
say,
in
january?
unknown
speaker
and
then
again
to
issue
a
10-day
suspension
of
trading
under
10
(k)
in
march?
unknown
speaker
for
the
same
reason?
unknown
speaker
well,
could
it
not
issue
a
10-day
suspension
on
trading
on
january
2,
and
then
takes
it
to
january
12,
and
then
on
the
morning
of
january
13,
to
issue
a
10-day
suspension
on
trading?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
what
is
the
difference
between
january
and
march,
and
january
10,
and
january
12
,
and
january
13.
unknown
speaker
well,
your
point
is
though
-
with
good
reasons
or
bad,
with
or
without
reasons,
no
matter
how
great
the
reason
or
how
great
the
public
interest
that
12
(k)
as
a
matter
of
the
power
of
the
commission
simply
does
not
empower
the
commission
to
issue
a
suspension
of
trading
for
longer
than
a
10-day
period.
unknown
speaker
that
is
your
basic
position
as
i
understand,
am
i
right?
unknown
speaker
by
which
part?
unknown
speaker
all
the
commissioner
went
to
office
and
on
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
all
the
members.
unknown
speaker
would
that
have
been
for
december
25?
unknown
speaker
i
just
want
to
be
sure
of
this.
you
are
telling
us
that
the
full
commission,
every
member
acts
on
a
suspension
order
and
personally
signed
something,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
yeah,
but
what
do
they
have
before
them
in
the
act?
unknown
speaker
or
are
there
supporting
papers
in
the
file
somewhere?
unknown
speaker
so
what
was
presented
to
the
commission?
unknown
speaker
why
not
the
commission's
minute
presented
all
the
rest
of
it,
say.
unknown
speaker
were
those
minutes
available
to
mr.
sloan
when
he
complains
about
what
the
sec
have
done?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
the
policy
of
the
commission?
unknown
speaker
suppose,
you
think
there
is
manipulation
in
an
unregistered
security
and
you
want
to
suspend
trading
and
you
look
at
the
statute,
says
ten
days,
you
suspend
and
you
continue
to
suspend,
what
is
that
pending?
what
other
remedy,
you
cannot
go
on
forever
as
longer
you
think
there
is
manipulation?
unknown
speaker
what
is
that
pending?
what
are
you
trying
to
find,
you
are
investigating,
you
have
probable
cause
you
think
to
believe
what?
unknown
speaker
under
what
section
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
so
there
is
a
remedy
that
you
can
have.
unknown
speaker
yes.
so,
there
is
a
remedy.
you
are
not
without
remedy.
unknown
speaker
so
that
you
can
do
it
on
your
own
until
you
can
convince
a
judge
to
give
you
a
preliminary
injunction.
unknown
speaker
so
without
evidence
you
can
do
ex
parte,
but
you
have
to
have
--
you
really
cannot
--
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it
is
ex
parte
you
did
not
give
mr.
sloan
notice
of
it.
unknown
speaker
that
does
not
(inaudible)
being
ex
parte,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
only
370
days.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
one
that
went
13
years
that
mr.
sloan
mentioned.
unknown
speaker
well,
was
this
a
series
of
10-day
suspension?
unknown
speaker
for
13
years?
