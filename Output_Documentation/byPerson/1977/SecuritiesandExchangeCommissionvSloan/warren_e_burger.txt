chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
securities
and
exchange
commission
against
sloan.
mr.
pitt
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
would
you
think
about
36
consecutive
suspensions
of
ten
days
each?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
court
had
decided
it
on
that
basis
would
you
be
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
that
both
of
these
observations
are
subject
to
what
you
were
seeming
to
say
it
before
that
it
might
well
be
abusive
a
discretion
to
have
36
suspensions
of
ten
days
each
and
that
you
would
not
be
here
if
the
court
had
placed
it
on
an
abusive
discretion.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
anything
outstanding
or
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
as
a
petitioner
i
suppose
it
is
kind
of
probable
one
thing’s
capability
of
repetition
is
required
but
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
anybody
owns
that
many
securities
and
if
you
are
suspending
that
much
trading
in
separate
securities
every
single
year,
eventually
those
lines
are
going
to
meet,
and
that
is
capable
repetition
yet
evading
review
with
respect
to
this
party.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
by
asking
the
court
of
appeals
to
review
certain
specific
suspension
orders.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
sloan,
before
you
commence
your
argument
when
court
granted
you
leave
to
appear
in
this
case,
you
received
a
notice,
the
usual
notice
to
counsel,
did
you
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
nothing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
march
1,
letter
you
would
have
not
received?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
aware
that
the
rules
for
current
require
that
counsel
(inaudible)
list
to
arguments
registrar
with
the
deputy
clerk
in
room
22
(d)
at
9.00
a.m.
or
shortly
after
that
on
the
day
of
signing
for
argument.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
you
better
check
your
mail
because
you
are
in
violation
of
that
rule
and
you
did
not
appear
here
till
2.30
today
and
the
court
can
not
organize
its
business
if
it
does
not
know
that
arguing
counsel
is
not
to
be
present.
now
you
may
proceed.

o’clock
tomorrow
morning.
chief

warren
e.

continue
the
arguments
in

and
exchange
commission
against
sloan.
mr.
sloan
you
may
continue
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
question
i
think
mr.
sloan
was
a
purely
hypothetical
right,
asking
whether
if
36
consecutive
10-day
orders
were
entered.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
my
hypothetical
was
deliberate
in
one
last
order
to
make
it
hypothetical.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
is
expired
mr.
sloan.
mr.
pitt
--
your
time
has
expired
here.
mr.
pitt
you
have
three
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
he
get
some
of
these
memos
that
are
in
the
record,
did
he
gets
some
by
supernal
process
or
simple
request?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
representing
to
us
that
had
he
requested
the
minutes,
he
would
have
got
the
minutes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
justice
rehnquist
will
have
three
judgments
and
opinions
for
the
court
to
announce.
