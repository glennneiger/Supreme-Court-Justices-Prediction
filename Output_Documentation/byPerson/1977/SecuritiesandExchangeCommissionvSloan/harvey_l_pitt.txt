mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
for
33
years
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
has
filed
the
practice
of
issuing
consecutive
but
separate
orders
of
ten
days
duration,
suspending
trading
and
security
when
necessary
to
provide
immediate
protection
for
the
investing
public
against
fraud,
manipulation
and
inadequate
corporate
disclosures,
and
the
commission
has
done
so
only
after
making
a
separate
and
fresh
review
of
the
then
current
facts
in
each
situation.
the
court
of
appeals,
however
in
this
case,
has
enjoined
the
commission
from
ever
again
suspending
trading
and
security
for
more
than
ten
consecutive
days,
despite
the
commission’s
longstanding
and
consistent
administrative
practice,
express
congressional
approval
of
that
practice
and
reenactment
and
expansion
of
the
commission’s
authority
in
that
regard.
although
the
commission
recognizes
that
it
may
not
exercise
its
summary
suspension
power,
for
an
indefinite
period
of
time,
what
we
respectfully
seek
from
this
court
is
the
restoration
of
the
full
measure
of
statutory
authority,
we
believe,
the
congress
intended
to
confirm.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
yes,
i
do.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
i
think
that
that
would
be
tested
by
whether
the
commission
has
abused
its
discretion,
and
it
would
depend
on
the
circumstances,
but
surely
where
the
commission
had
adequate
basis
for
permitting
trading
to
resume,
it
would
be
an
abuse
of
its
discretion
and
i
think
that
courts
can
review
that
issue
and
direct
the
commission
to
terminate
its
trading
suspension.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
of
course
the
--
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
of
course
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
never
reached
the
question
of
an
abusive
discretion,
and
the
facts
in
context
in
this
case
do
not
suggest
that
there
was
necessarily
an
abusive
discretion
with
respect
to
that
matter.
that
is
an
issue
that
could
be
tested,
had
this
case
been
heard
timely
which
is
one
of
the
issues
that
court
has
asked
me
to
address.
i
do
think
that
at
some
point
a
trading
suspension
can
constitute
an
abusive
discretion
and
certainly
in
a
case
36
consecutive
suspensions
might
constitute
an
abusive
discretion.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
if
the
court
had
held
that
it
was
an
abusive
discretion,
no
your
honor
we
would
not.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
i
think
that
there
are
degrees
of
concern
that
the
commission
would
have
had
with
respect
to
the
suspensions
at
varying
points
in
time
and
that
a
court,
if
the
matter
was
properly
presented
to
it,
could
differentiate
between
the
factual
circumstances
that
existed
anytime.
bear
in
mind,
i
think
that
the
commission
does
have
a
large
measure
of
discretion
in
this
area.
its
focus
is
to
protect
trading
and
the
public
investors
who
trade
in
these
securities
and
in
this
particular
case,
there
was
an
alleged
market
manipulation
which
in
fact
the
commission
ultimately
concluded
had
existed.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
i
do
not
believe
that
the
mere
number
of
suspensions
per
se
would
give
rise
to
an
abusive
discretion.
i
think
it
is
hard
to
fashion
that
kind
of
a
rule.
i
think
in
any
given
factual
context
the
continued
duration
of
these
suspensions
may
constitute
an
abusive
discretion,
but
i
do
not
think
a
court
can
simply
say,
because
consistent
for
18
consecutive
periods
that,
that
was
an
abusive
discretion.
take
for
example,
the
situation
where
there
is
rapid
manipulation
ongoing
and
the
commission
is
trying
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
that
manipulation.
it
is
having
difficulty
nailing
down
the
evidence,
finding
out
whether
the
manipulation
existed.
it
might
take
180
days
to
put
that
case
together,
go
into
court,
obtain
an
injunction
and
prevent
the
manipulators
from
reeking
the
habit
that
they
might
be
perpetrating
in
the
markets.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
we
can
if
we
have
put
together
prima
facie
case
indicating
the
probable
likelihood
of
success
on
the
merits.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
no,
my
hypothesis
is
that
the
commission,
having
sufficient
cause
to
believe
that
there
is
a
possibility
of
manipulation
and
not
having
enough
evidence
yet
to
go
into
court,
can
suspend
trading.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
i
think
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
that
that
is
susceptible
of
a
hard
and
fast
objective
standard.
i
could
not
say
to
the
court
that
it
should
take
the
commission
30
days
or
40
days,
or
50
days.
i
can
say
that
a
court
can
look
at
the
type
of
case
and
determine
whether
an
investigation
has
bought
down,
it
is
not
being
pursued
diligently,
or
there
are
explanations
as
to
why
a
matter
is
taking
as
long
as
it
is,
and
i
think
that
the
commission
has
an
obligation
to
be
sensitive
to
the
fact
that
a
suspension
of
trading
can
cause
some
problems
for
investors
and
should
be
terminated
as
promptly
as
possible.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
in
this
case
it
was
370
days,
one
year
and
ten
days.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
yes,
but
the
one
year
suspension
--
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
--
involved
three
separate
grounds,
as
it
turned
out,
and
the
commission
did
review
the
circumstances
each
ten
days.
we
were
dealing
with
people
who
are
fugitives
from
justice.
we
were
dealing
with
both
foreign
and
domestic
marketplaces
and
the
effects
of
manipulations
in
both
marketplaces.
this
was
a
complicated
case
which
the
commission
had
put
together.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
no,
i
would
say
that
as
well
as
the
fact
that
i
think
that
the
original
enactment
contemplated
the
construction
that
we
have
placed
on
it
for
33
years
and
that
i
think
can
be
gleamed
from
a
precise
reading
of
the
statute.
the
statute
--
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
no,
i
do
not,
but
we
think
both
arguments
succeed
or
should
succeed.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
yes,
your
honor
in
the
initial
1934
act,
the
authority
to
suspend
trading
was
limited
to
securities
that
were
listed
on
an
exchange.
in
1964,
at
the
specific
request
of
the
commission,
the
congress
expended
that
authority
to
all
securities
traded
in
the
over
the
counter
markets
as
well
as
in
listed
securities.
it
was
at
that
time,
that
the
commission
presented
to
the
congress
as
it
had
previously
each
year
in
its
annual
report,
its
consistent
practice
of
successive,
but
separate
suspension
orders,
and
the
senate
report
expressly
approved
and
accepted
the
interpretation
of
the
commission
and
the
house
would
be
commission’s
assistant
in
grafting
the
bill,
expand
that
our
authority
do
encompass
over
the
counter
markets.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
yes
your
honor
i
do,
and
i
think
it
stamps
back
not
just
from
the
legislative
development
but
from
our
annual
reports
as
well.
starting
in
1946
and
each
year
thereafter,
we
provided
furnished
information
to
the
congress
with
respect
to
our
practices
with
regard
to
trading
suspensions.
i
think
the
congress
was
aware
of
this
indeed
in
1950
--
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
i
am
suggesting
that
there
may
be
congressman
who
do
read
it
and
do
not
read
it.
i
think
for
purposes
of
construing
what
the
congressional
intent
was
when
congress
acted
upon
our
legislation
that
are
expressed
explanation
of
our
policies
which
took
several
forms.
the
annual
report
may
be
one
lesser
form
of
that.
we
also
went
to
congress
or
oversight
committees
were
priced
of
this
in
1959
and
in
1960,
we
indicated
that
the
policy
of
successive
rollovers
where
a
separate
determination
was
made,
was
one
that
we
have
been
employing
consistently.
we
got
expressed
committee
approval
of
that
by
one
of
our
oversight
committees.
in
1964
we
--
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
well,
i
think
that
the
congressional
expansion
of
our
authority
coupled
with
an
acceptance
of
that
interpretation
in
the
committee
reports
accompanying
the
bill
is
about
as
good
an
indication
as
we
can
have
in
the
circumstances
without
--
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
no
and
that
was
supplied
in
1964.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
i
do,
but
i
would
not
minimize
in
1959
approval
by
the
oversight
committees,
because
congress,
as
this
court
is
well
aware,
monitors
the
activities
of
the
independent
regulatory
agencies
through
its
oversight
committees.
they
are
the
ones
responsible
for
monitoring
our
activities
and
determining
whether
our
acts
are
in
the
first
instance
appeared
to
be
in
accordance
with
congressional
intent.
it
is
true
that
the
words
of
a
congressional
oversight
committee
cannot
bind
the
whole
congress.
that
came
in
1964.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
i
think
your
honor
that
the
term
ex
parte
would
presume
a
proceeding
and
the
answer
to
that
is
to
full.
the
commission
staff
usually
suffice
information
for
the
commission
that
is
not
in
advisory
context.
it
is
simply
the
commission
and
its
staff
reviewing
information.
we
do,
however,
receive
request
from
corporate
issuers,
trustees,
and
bankruptcies,
and
in
fact
the
courts
on
occasion
and
those
are
transmitted
from
the
staff
to
the
commission.
we
have
adopted
--
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
an
issuer
has
notice
of
the
fact
that
in
most
cases
that
a
suspension
is
about
to
be
issued
unless
the
circumstances
are
such
an
emergency
nature
that
we
are
required
to
announce
it
before
notifying
the
issuer.
we
do
have
a
specific
procedure
that
permits
an
issuer
or
any
person
who
believes
that
they
have
information
bearing
on
the
wisdom
or
lack
of
wisdom
of
our
trading
suspension
power
to
furnish
the
commission
with
information
as
to
whether
or
not
a
particular
trading
suspension
should
be
listed.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
i
am
not
certain,
if
we
posit
the
situation
where
it
is
due
to
the
issuer’s
misconduct
that
the
trading
suspension
has
issued,
then
section
12
(j)
of
the
securities
exchange
act
contemplates
that
the
commission
should
at
some
point,
commence
a
proceeding.
it
is
conceivable
--
although
i
must
confess
i
have
not
given
thought
to
this
that
an
issuer
might
seek
into
the
administrative
procedure
act
to
claim
that
he
can
compel
agency
action
unlawfully
withheld
which
is
a
12
(j)
proceeding
to
have
an
adjudication
on
the
merits.
in
the
absence
of
an
issuer’s
violation
of
the
act,
12
(j)
is
inapplicable,
indeed
that
is
the
problem
with
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
has
led
us
to
this
court,
and
in
that
circumstance,
it
seems
to
me
that
an
issuer
might
have
a
cause
of
action
for
review
of
an
abusive
discretion,
but
i
do
not
know
that
issuer
could
compel
us
to
hold
an
administrative
proceeding,
but
i
think
in
either
event,
the
issuer
would
get
the
question
before
a
court
and
have
the
timely
resolution
of
the
suspension
it
starts.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
we
--
with
respect
to
your
first
question,
there
is
no
written
rule
that
binds
the
commission
to
a
process
there
is
the
same
consistent
approach
to
the
commission
as
always
followed
in
the
record
does
evidence
that
here,
namely
it
is
that
the
staff
is
required,
if
it
believes
that
a
trading
suspension
should
be
continued
to
furnish
the
commission
with
information
suggesting
why
that
suspension
should
be
considered.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
at
some
point
the
commission
as
a
matter
of
internal
discipline
required
something
new.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
not
necessarily.
it
may
be,
for
example
in
this
case,
the
staff
may
be
finding
out
from
the
royal
canadian
mounted
police
as
was
the
case
here,
what
the
extent
of
their
information
was
with
manipulation
and
it
indicated
to
the
commission
that
it
was
going
to
newfoundland
to
take
testimony.
that
took
several
weeks
to
arrange.
in
that
context
it
was
certainly
understandable
that
ten
days
later
the
memorandum
to
the
commission
from
the
staff
would
indicate
the
fact
that
this
was
still
the
procedure
that
was
going
to
be
followed
and
what
the
developments
were
in
arranging
that
testimony,
but
the
information
would
have
been
the
same.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
no,
i
believe
--
and
of
course
that
is
not
this
case.
i
believe
if
the
staff
thought
it
would
take
them
six
months
to
get
the
information
and
so
apprise
the
commission
that
that
would
be
the
strongest
case
for
arguing
that
the
commission
would
be
under
responsibility
to
publish
whatever
facts
it
was
aware
of
and
terminate
the
suspension
as
promptly
as
possible,
but
that
situation
would
be
the
kind
of
situation
that
could
be
dealt
with
in
a
case
seeking
to
review
the
commission’s
action
for
abusive
discretion.
if
i
have
not
responded
i
can
elaborate.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
the
second
question
as
i
understood
it
was
what
statutory
remedies
are
available
to
the
commission
if
there
is
issuer
misconduct?
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
okay.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
again,
it
would
depend
on
the
kind
of
information
we
had
available.
if
12
(j)
is
inapplicable
we
would
use
the
ten
day
power
either
to
assist
us
in
getting
into
court,
for
example,
with
a
temporary
restraining
order
or
preliminary
injunction,
because
by
that
time
we
would
have
filed
our
complaint,
the
facts
would
be
public,
and
investors
would
be
alerted
to
what
our
allegations
were,
and
that
is
our
policy,
we
do
not
weight
for
the
action
to
be
litigated.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
because
the
preliminary
injunction
is
necessary
to
stop
the
people
who
are
violating
the
law.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
the
fact
that
we
can
suspend
trading
will
not
protect
those
people
who
have
been
victimized
by
the
violations
of
law.
the
commission’s
position
--
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
no,
in
that
circumstance
the
suspension
of
trading
would
be
necessary
to
alert
investors
to
the
facts.
once
they
are
informed
to
the
facts
the
commission
does
not
assume
a
paternalistic
position.
investors,
once
they
know
as
much
as
we
know,
are
free
to
make
their
own
investment
decisions
so
long
as
there
is
not
a
manipulation
in
the
marketplace.
that
is
something
that
would
be
of
greater
concern.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
that
is
correct.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
the
injunction
in
that
circumstance
would
not
address
itself
to
trading
at
all.
and
once
the
complaint
was
filed
the
trading
suspension
would
be
lifted.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
that
is
precisely
the
purpose
of
the
suspension,
although
in
the
case
of
a
market
manipulation
it
may
be
to
get
us
into
the
court
and
take
some
preliminary
action.
so
in
the
market
manipulation
context
the
fact
that
there
is
some
information
may
not
prevent
investors
from
being
abused,
but
by
enlarge,
your
honor
has
concisely
stated
what
our
need
for
the
suspension
powers
are?
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
in
this
case
there
were
three
separate
basis
in
the
series
of,
suspension,
consecutive
suspension
orders.
there
was
a
market
manipulation
both
here
and
abroad
that
had
to
be
tracked
down,
there
was
a
change
in
management
of
the
company
and
there
were
a
failure
to
file
current
reports.
three
separate
basis
that
occurred
over
the
course
of
that
one
year
period
which
is
precisely
why
we
believe
that
the
limitation
that
the
court
of
appeals
below
put
on
our
suspension
power
is
inconsistent
with
the
statutory
intent
both
in
1934,
again
in
1964,
and
finally
in
1975
when
the
act
was
amended
again.
we
briefly
stated,
the
court
also
asked
us
to
address
the
question
of
mootness,
and
i
hope
it
is
plain
that
the
commission
of
course
prefers
a
decision
on
the
merits
in
this
case
because
our
summary
suspension
authority
has
been
a
critical
element
of
our
enforcement
and
policing
of
the
securities
markets.
nevertheless
because
the
court
invited
us
to
discuss
the
question
of
mootness
we
have
given
careful
consideration
to
whether
this
case
was
properly
before
the
court
of
appeals.
in
terms
of
the
relevant
facts,
on
that
issue
i
think
all
that
needed
to
be
stated
is
that
at
the
time
this
case
was
presented
to
the
court
below,
the
petition
was
filed
nine
days
later
the
trading
suspensions
terminated.
at
the
time
of
oral
argument,
at
the
time
of
briefing,
and
at
the
time
of
the
second
circuit’s
decision
there
were
no
trading
suspensions
in
effect.
the
court
held
nevertheless
that
the
case
was
not
moot
based
on
this
court’s
decision
in
southern
pacific
terminal
co.
against
the
icc
suggesting
that
the
matter
was
capable
of
reputation
yet
evading
review.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
your
honors
as
precisely
the
question
that
gives
rise
to
our
dilemma
with
respect
to
mootness,
there
was
no
district
court
complaint
in
this
action,
in
this
particular
action,
although
one
had
been
tried
previously.
this
was
a
petition
for
review
pursuant
to
section
25
(a)
of
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934
which
sought
review
of
a
discrete
set
of
orders,
this
one
year
set
of
orders.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
that
is
right,
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
it
is
set
forth
on
page
122
of
the
appendix.
it
does
not
challenge
in
terms
all
of
the
commission’s
orders
with
respect
to
trading
suspensions;
it
challenges
one
series
that
lasted
as
the
court
has
indicated
for
a
year
with
respect
to
canadian
javelin
stock.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
well,
your
honor.
it
is
not
clear
that
it
is
not
moot,
and
it
may
well
be
moot
for
the
following
reasons:
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
in
so
far
as
the
petition
for
review
sought
judicial
review
of
that
precise
question
as
to
whether
canadian
javelin
stock
should
have
been
suspended,
or
could
have
been
suspended
that
order
no
longer
exists
and
the
case
ordinarily
would
be
moot.
the
analysis,
as
i
understand
this
court’s
decision,
requires
us
to
consider
whether
it
is
capable
of
repetition
and
yet
evading
review,
in
a
sense
it
is
not
capable
of
repetition
at
least
to
the
degree
of
certitude
that
this
court
has
required
in
its
prior
decisions,
because
this
specific
review
proceeding
was
over
the
suspension
of
canadian
javelin
stock
and
it
is
by
no
means
clear
that
this
commission
would
again
suspend
trading
in
canadian
javelin
stock
nor
certainly
for
the
same
reasons.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
that
is
correct.
it
is
our
contention
as
we
set
forth
both
in
our
petition
and
in
our
brief
on
the
merits
in
this
court
that
weinstein
agaisnt
bradford
is
dispositive
of
this
case.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
therefore
it
is
moot,
if
the
petitioner
is
viewed
in
its
capacity
as
a
shareholder
of
canadian
javelin
stock,
which
is
the
posture
he
was
in,
in
the
court
of
appeals.
if
however,
the
case
is
viewed
with
respect
to
the
generic
question
of
the
appropriateness
of
trading
suspensions,
it
is
certainly
clear
that
this
is
an
issue
that
is
capable
of
repetition.
we
will,
if
this
court
restores
our
power
in
appropriate
circumstances,
resume
ten
day
trading
suspensions
on
a
consecutive,
but
separate
basis.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
we
have
done
nothing
against
this
particular
respondent.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
i
believe
weinstein
agaisnt
bradford
and
defunis
against
odegaard
both
support
that
proposition
your
honor.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
he
has
now
changed
that
in
his
brief
on
the
merits
which
we
just
received
to
allege
150
securities,
12
of
which
have
been
the
subject
of
consecutive
suspensions.
he
also
--
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
something
along
that
line
yes.
consecutively
we
suspended
more,
but
only
about
20
a
year
on
a
consecutive
basis.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
that
is
correct.
now,
if
--
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
that,
that
would
--
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
we
would
concede
and
we
did
set
forth
a
probability
formula
which
suggests
one
possible
analysis,
we
would
concede
that
it
is
possible
that
a
stock
that
the
respondent
owns
may
be
subject
to
a
consecutive
suspension,
but
even
if
that
is
true
that
does
not
reach
the
second
phase
of
the
southern
pacific
case
which
is
whether
this
matter
is
a
matter
that
evades
review.
and
for
that
question
it
depends
on
the
kind
of
review
that
is
sought.
if
the
review
that
is
sought
is
of
the
statutory
authority
of
the
commission
to
suspend
trading
for
more
than
one
ten
day
period
that
is
a
question
which
we
believe
does
not
evade
review
even
if
this
court
holds
that
the
lower
court's
decision
should
be
vacated
for
mootness.
after
all
this
respondent
could
have
done
what
the
respondents
in
others
of
the
cases
that
have
been
held
not
to
be
moot
did
namely
institute
a
district
court
action
seeking
declaratory
relief
and
an
injunction.
in
fact,
however,
that
is
precisely
what
this
respondent
did
in
1974,
and
what
is
surprising
to
us
is
he
made
that
claim
and
challenged
our
trading
suspension
authority
both
as
to
constitutional
basis,
successive
basis,
and
as
an
abusive
discretion.
the
district
court
ruled
on
the
merits
and
claimed
that
the
allegations
were
frivolous.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
affirmed
and
this
court
denied
certiorari
and
our
concern
is
that
--
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
indeed
he
has
learned
well,
so
he
has
now
filed
the
petition
if
this
court
were
to
hold
as
we
think
it
probably
must
that
the
second
circuit’s
decision
should
be
vacated
for
mootness,
viewed
in
the
capacity
in
which
the
case
was
presented
there.
we
would
be
lost
(ph)
to
see
the
same
sequence
of
events
that
occurred
in
1974
commence
allover
again
in
a
sense
even
the
government
need
some
protection
against
repetitive
litigation.
in
sum
--
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
i
am
constrained
to
advise
the
court
that
my
reading
of
the
cases
suggest
that
the
case
was
moot
at
the
time
that
second
circuit
decided.
we
would
like
to
see
a
decision
on
merits.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
that
is
correct.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
it
is
certain
that
we
will
be
back
in
district
court
again
as
soon
as
the
decision
is
vacated.
in
sum,
the
commission
is
going
to
be
--
commission’s
construction
of
section
12
(k)
has
been
used
to
maintain
fair
and
orderly
capital
markets.
we
believe
that
the
decision
below
weakens
the
capacity
of
the
commission
in
an
unfair
manner
to
monitor
the
securities,
markets,
and
urge
that
this
court
reverse
the
decision
of
the
court
below.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
thank
you.
the
only
brief
points
i
wish
to
make
or
that
as
mr.
sloan
conceived
at
the
end
of
his
submission,
12
(j)
was
inapplicable
in
this
circumstance
because
the
market
manipulation
which
went
on
was
not
engaged
in
by
the
company
and
therefore
issuer
misconduct
was
not
involved
in
12
(j)
was
inapplicable
that
would
have
meant
that
there
was
no
remedy
whatsoever.
in
addition
to
manipulation
that
we
charged,
was
charged
to
have
begun
in
the
beginning
of
1975
and
continued
right
up
to
the
date
of
the
complaint.
it
did
not
stop
in
february
1975
according
to
the
charges
in
our
allegation.
the
last
point
--
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
we
learned
about
it
late,
about
that
time.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
it
was
the
manipulation.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
that
is
correct.
we
--
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
apparently
so.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
there
was
deliberation
with
respect
to
each
of
these
suspension
orders
as
i
indicated
yesterday.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
by
the
commission
itself.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
i
do
not
recall
the
precise
date,
i
would
have
to
look
that,
but
i
do
not
recall
the
precise
date
of
the
order,
but
what
happens
is
that
each
of
the
commissioners
must
approve
the
trading
suspension
order.
it
cannot
be
done
by
any
other
official.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
pardon.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
there
is
a
minute
of
the
commission
entered;
that
is
correct.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
that
is
--
there
is
an
official
commission
minute
record
book
that
is
kept
in
the
agency.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
i
do
not
know
if
that
was.
i
must
confess
i
do
not
know
if
that
was
the
precise
date
that
that
trading
suspension
order
was
entered.
what
would
have
happened
is
that
the
order
might
have
been
ordered
on
the
25
formally,
but
the
decision
to
enter
that
order
would
have
been
taken
three
or
four
days
prior
to
that.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
a
quorum
of
the
commission
minimum
of
three
of
the
five
members,
if
some
members
are
sick
or
out
of
town,
they
might
not
participate,
but
a
minimum
of
three
commissioners
must
participate
and
their
votes
are
recorded
in
an
official
minute.
if
the
matter
is
taken
around
seriatim
--
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
they
have
a
staff
memorandum
and
the
advice
of
their
legal
assistants,
each
commissioner
has
a
separate
legal
assistant.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
sometimes
they
might
and
many
cases
they
would
reflect
--
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
this
record
does
not
contain
a
typical
minute.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
no.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
yes.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
yes,
those
are
in
the
record,
the
staff
recommendations
and
the
information
that
was
given
to
the
commission
are
in
the
reocrd.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
i
simply
do
not
know
why
that
was
not
put
in
the
record
below.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
no,
your
honor.
the
commission
did
not
meet
on
christmas
day.
the
period
of
the
trading
suspension
commenced
on
christmas
day.
the
staff
recommendation
would
have
come
up
three
or
four
days
earlier
at
which
point
the
commission
would
have
met.
the
commission
probably
took
that
action
on
december
21,
or
22,
to
commence
on
december
25.
the
commission
itself
would
not
meet
on
christmas
day.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
the
minutes
indicate
that
the
staff
has
made
certain
matters
known
to
in
general,
and
that
the
commission
has
taken
action
because
the
public
interest
and
the
protection
of
investor
was
required.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
i
am
simply
unaware
whether
he
requested
them
in
this
case
or
whether
they
were
made
available.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
the
policy
of
the
commission
is
often
to
make
its
minutes
available
in
court
litigation
where
they
are
requested,
and
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
where
they
are
requested.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
the
commission's
minutes
are
made
available
under
the
freedom
of
information
act,
unless
they
contain
certain
matters
that
might
be
exempt
and
they
are
--
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
i
think
mr.
--
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
if
mr.
sloan
makes
a
request
to
the
commission
to
seek
commission
minutes
and
there
is
no
exempt
material
in
there
and
he
would
see
the
commission's
minutes.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
he
did
get,
i
think
he
requested
them
and
we
made
them
available
as
part
of
the
record
and
he
had
them.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
i
would
have
to
know
what
was
in
the
minutes?
the
precise
minutes
of
these
particular
actions
to
say
whether
there
might
have
been
excisions,
but
i
think
he
would
have
gotten
the
minutes,
yes.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
that
is
correct.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
to
believe
if
we
can
go
into
court
either
get
a
preliminary
injunction
or
--
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
under
section
21
of
the
securities
exchange
act.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
to
stop
the
manipulation.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
we
are
not.
the
remedy
we
lack
if
mr.
sloan's
interpretation
of
the
10-day
suspension
power
is
correct,
is
from
the
time
we
learn
that
there
might
be
a
manipulation
to
the
time
that
we
conclude
there
is
one
and
can
go
to
court
to
stop
it,
under
mr.
sloan's
theory,
we
would
be
compelled
to
allow
the
manipulation
to
take
place.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
until
we
can
find
out
who
did
it?
and
convince
the
judge
to
enjoin.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
no,
as
i
indicated
yesterday
i
think
that
we
could
have
used
--
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
mr.
sloan
avail
themselves
of
a
procedure
that
is
published
in
the
code
of
federal
regulations
to
price
the
commission
of
information.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
first,
we
do
not
suggest
that
we
can
renew
the
suspension
forever
and
i
wish
to
stress
that
point.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
in
this
particular
case
and
although
the
court
did
not
find
an
abuse
--
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
the
one
that
went
on
for
13
years
was
a
bankruptcy
proceeding
and
in
which
--
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
there
was
a
series
of
--
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
there
was
a
series
of
10-day
suspensions.
in
that
case
we
had
specific
request
from
court
appointed
officers
to
suspend
the
trading
and
the
commission
obliged
the
trustee
and
bankruptcy
while
a
reorganization
proceeding
was
effected.
our
present
policy
would
not
be
to
repeat
that
kind
of
activity.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
no,
we
could
not.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
this
is
a
broader
remedy
and
it
is
solely
a
stopgap
remedy,
until
we
can
stop
the
market
forces
that
are
disrupting
an
orderly
market
place.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
stopgap.
that
is
correct.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
that
is
the
first
memorandum
that
is
in
the
record,
and
i
cannot
be
sure
whether
there
was
an
earlier
memorandum,
but
what
often
happens
in
response
to
that
question
is
that
the
staff
will
come
up
on
an
emergency
basis
orally
and
advise
the
commission
that
it
has
learned
of
certain
facts
and
tell
the
commission
they,
as
in
this
case,
had
talked
to
royal
canadian
mounted
police
authorities
that
they
suspected
a
manipulation,
and
that
there
was
a
possible
criminal
indictment
in
canada,
and
the
commission
would,
on
the
basis
of
that
oral
presentation,
enter
a
suspension
order.
under
the
sunshine
act,
this
is
now
in
effect,
those
discussions
would
be
recorded
and
there
would
be
a
tape
recording
to
verify
it.
that
act
was
not
in
effect
at
the
time
that
this
occurred.
