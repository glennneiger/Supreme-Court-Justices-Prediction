justice
john
paul
stevens
for
how
long,
how
long
should
it
there
be
required
to
get
enough
evidence
to
make
out
a
prima
facie
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
two
questions
mr.
pitt,
i
will
put
them
both
at
once,
if
i
may.
are
there
any
regulations
or
anything
in
this
record
to
tell
us
what
kind
of
a
procedure
the
commission
follows
when
it
issues
a
successive
order?
is
there
any
kind
of
a
--
or
can
it
just
be
done
by
somebody
saying,
okay
let
us
extend
it
another
ten
days.
and
my
second
question
is
if
during
a
period
of
suspensions
the
commission
does
find
it
has
enough
evidence
to
make
out
prima
facie
case
of
violation,
what
is
the
statutory
procedure
available
to,
if
they
go
into
court
and
get
some
kind
of
injunction
is
there,
other
than
12
(j)?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
could
that
information
that
it
could
be
what
we
tell
to
you
last
week
is
still
true.
do
they
have
to
have
anything
new?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
it
each
ten
days
record
or
something?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
if
the
information
in
effect
said
would
take
us
about
six
months
to
get
a
case
together
then
they
just
have
rubber
stamps
for
six
months.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
have
not
responded
the
second
question,
maybe
you
do
not
remember
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
just
wandering
why
--
if
you
have
the
ten
day
power
in
your
claim,
why
you
would
even
run
in
the
court
for
preliminary
adjunctions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
purpose
of
the
suspension
then
is
to
give
you
time
to
assemble
information
to
make
public
so
that
thereafter
the
investing
public
to
make
and
form
decisions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
in
this
case
it
took
a
year
to
get
enough
information
there
to
issue
the
appropriate
press
release.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
sloan
let
me
ask
you,
what
is
your
view
of
what
the
commission's
duty
was
ten
days
after
the
first
order
was
entered,
if
they
were
persuaded
there
was
market
manipulation
going
on,
but
they
did
not
have
real
solid
proof
of
it?
what
do
you
say
they
should
have
done?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
do
not
suggest
then
that
there
should
be
some
other
legal
proceeding
or
some
other
legal
remedy
that
was
available
at
the
end
of
the
ten
days
to
perpetuate
the
suspension.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
pitt
is
mr.
sloan
correct
in
telling
us
that
the
change
of
management
and
the
late
10
(k)
filings
occurred
in
march
1976
so
they
really
could
not
have
justified
the
first
25
or
30
suspension
orders.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
is
your
principal
period
of
suspension.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
was
the
manipulation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
also
correct
that
there
was
an
order
entered
on
christmas
that
just
did
not
get
into
the
record?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
i
think
was
given
great
deliberation
on
that
day.
justice
john
paul
stevens
quite
required
from
the
court
litigation;
normally
you
can
see
a
court
order
without
having
litigation,
is
that
the
policy
of
the
commission?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
implies
that
they
are
not
made
available
to
mr.
sloan
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
unless
he
proceeds
under
freedom
of
information
act.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
pitt,
am
i
correct
that
the
suspension
order
suspends
trading
in
the
stock
by
anyone
whether
involved
a
manipulation
or
not,
now
if
you
have
got
to
go
into
court
you
would
proceed
against
the
manipulators,
you
might
get
injunction
against
manipulation,
but
could
you
in
court
get
injunction
against
trading
by
everyone?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
really
this
is
a
broader
remedy
in
its
coverage
than
the
remedy
you
can
get
in
court
with
notice
and
hearing
all
the
rest,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
another
question,
is
mr.
sloan
correct
in
saying
the
first
suspension
as
i
believe
was
on
april
29,
and
the
first
memorandum
then
the
commission
files
explaining
the
reasons
for
the
suspension
or
recommending
it
is
may
02,
is
that
correct?
