mr.
pitt,
they
did
the
general
rule
that
one
lawyer
gets
a
temporary
injunction
or
restraining
order
he
thought
he
has
undefined
once
he
gets
it.
[laughter]
and
i
am
only
afraid,
if
admit
that
is
true,
why
would
not
that
be
true
once
you
get
a
10-day
one
that
you
can
renew
forever,
why
would
not
you
be
absent?
