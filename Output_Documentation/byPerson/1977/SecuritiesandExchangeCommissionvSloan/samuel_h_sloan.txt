mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
no,
i
have
not
received
anything
since
the
time
there
was
one
week
ago
that
i
was
advised
that
i
would
be
allowed
to
argue,
i
have
not
received
anything.
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
no.
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
no,
i
have
not.
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
no,
i
am
not
aware
that
rule.
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
thank
you
very
much
your
honor.
gentleman,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
sam
sloan.
i
believe
this
is
a
simple
case.
the
section
12
(k)
of
the
securities
exchange
act
gives
the
sec
the
authority
to
suspend
trade
in
a
security
for
a
period
not
exceeding
ten
days.
here
the
sec
has
suspended
trading
in
a
security
for
370
days,
therefore
the
sec
has
filed
the
statute
and
the
court
of
appeals
under
the
circumstances
was
rquired
to
enjoin
the
sec
from
issuing
from
continuous
practice
which
it
has
continued
over
a
period
of
33
years.
now
they
say,
the
case
has
moot,
but
the
problem
that
anyone
has
in
objecting
to
this
procedure
of
the
sec
is
the
problem
that
i
face,
because
as
the
sec
has
pointed
out
i
started
a
case
back
in
1974
protesting
the
trading
suspensions
in
canadian
javelin
limited
and
these
suspensions
continued
and
i
lost
that
case
then
i
came
back
with
a
petition
for
review
and
the
court
of
appeals
again
protesting
the
trading
suspensions
of
canadian
javelin
limited
and
i
lost
that
case.
finally,
and
the
reason
i
lost
the
second
case
was
because
the
sec
said
that
they
were
going
to
an
administrative
hearing.
i
applied
to
the
sec
for
an
administrative
hearing.
they
waited
until
they
were
ready
to
enter
their
last
trading
suspension
order,
and
they
did
so
and
at
the
same
time,
they
denied
my
request
for
an
administrative
hearing,
and
thus
putting
me
back
into
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
time.
now
they
say
because
of
their
delays
and
because
they
ran
me
around
for
approximately
two
years
prior
to
getting
me
back
into
the
court
of
appeals
by
making
a
bunch
of
suggestion,
such
as
the
suggestion
that
they
were
going
to
give
me
administrative
hearing,
which
in
fact
they
did
not
give
that
the
case
has
become
moot
upon
expiration
of
the
consecutive
ten
day.
the
last
order
which
was
timed
to
coincide
with
the
denial
of
my
request
for
hearing.
i
do
not
believe
that
a
government
agency
can
be
allowed
to
put
a
person
in
this
kind
of
position
where
they
are
controlling
the
case,
where
they
are
deciding
at
what
point
i
can
object
to
their
procedure,
and
they
can
then
manipulate
the
facts
in
such
a
way
to
say
that
case
is
moot
before
i
have
ever
had
an
opportunity
to
present
my
claims.
now,
they
say
that
the
case,
the
action
of
the
sec
can
only
be
reviewed
by
a
court
in
an
abusive
discretion
situation.
well,
as
the
court
is
well
aware
if
you
file
a
petition
for
review
in
the
court
of
appeals
--
now
i
tried
to
proceed
in
the
district
court,
i
lost
the
sec
said
my
exclusive
remedy
was
to
file
a
petition
for
review
in
the
court
of
appeals.
so
since
they
told
me
what
my
remedy
was,
i
pursued
that
remedy.
i
filed
a
petition
for
review
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
when
i
got
up
there,
they,
at
that
point,
said
that
this
really
was
not
my
remedy,
i
should
go
back
to
the
commission
and
where
they
would
give
me
an
administrative
hearing.
now,
in
the
situation
where
they
say
a
court
may
review
a
case
on
the
matter
of
abusive
discretion
the
question
arises.
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
wish
to
bring
the
attention
of
the
court
to
a
small
factual
matter
which
came
to
my
attention
yesterday.
you
mentioned
36
trading
suspension
orders
and
the
source
of
this
is
because
on
page
122
of
the
appendix,
there
is
a
list
of
orders
and
there
was
a
typographical
error
and
that
the
sec
when
they
copied
my
original
petition
left
out,
the
december
25,
1975
order.
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
yes,
but
i
did
discover
that
there
are
36
listed
here
and
in
fact
they
were
37,
because
there
is
a
typographical
error
in
their
appendix.
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
okay,
for
whatever
reason
i
did
notice
that
--
in
the
original
record,
i
do
have
the
december
25
date
in
my
petition
i
were
to
file
to
the
court
of
appeals
which
has
been
transmitted
to
this
court.
however,
on
the
subject
of
the
record
i
also
wish
to
bring
to
the
attention
of
this
court
the
fact
that
the
sec
has
refused
to
permit
the
record
as
it
was,
in
the
state
it
was,
before
the
court
of
appeals
to
be
transmitted
to
this
court.
i
mentioned
this
in
my
brief,
and
it
is
now
a
matter
which
is
pending
before
the
court
of
appeals
because
i
filed
a
motion
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
require
that
the
sec
to
certify
the
full
record
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
that
matter
is
now
pending.
i
have
also
explained
what
happened
in
some
detail
in
a
letter
which
i
wrote
to
this
court,
but
he
has
advised
me
that
he
will
not
distribute
it
at
this
late
date.
what
essentially
happened
was
that
after
the
court
of
appeals
made
its
decision,
the
court
of
appeals
sent
the
record
back
to
the
sec
which
is
its
normal
practice.
when
this
court
granted
certiorari,
the
sec
was
directed
or
requested
to
send
the
record
back
to
the
court
of
appeals,
so
it
could
be
transmitted
to
this
court,
but
what
it
did,
was
it
switched
the
record,
so
that
the
record
that
was
sent
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
was
not
the
record,
which
the
court
of
appeals
had
returned
to
the
sec
and
the
court
of
appeals
does
not
appraise
to
this
fact.
so
that
the
record
which
this
court
has
consist
of
memorandums
dealing
with
trading
suspension
orders.
i
have
no
objection
to
this
court
reading
these
memorandums,
but
the
fact
remains
that
they
were
not
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals.
all
that
was
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals
was
a
certified
list.
the
record
which
has
not
been
transmitted
to
this
court,
concerns
the
record
of
the
administrative
proceedings
against
me
which
was
a
part
of
the
record
in
the
consolidated
case
when
these
two
cases
were
before
the
court
of
appeals.
the
sec
says
that
that
record
is
not
pertinent
to
the
issues
involved
in
this
appeal
and
therefore
they
will
not
transmit
that
record
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
certification
to
this
court,
even
though
they
have
been
requested
by
the
court
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
do
so.
so
right
now
we
have
a
situation
because
i
happen
to
feel
that
that
record
is
pertinent
to
the
question
of
mootness
which
the
sec
has
raised
particularly
with
regard
to
certain
points
which
were
discussed
yesterday.
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
well,
the
sec
has
always
said
that
this
case
was
moot
right
from
the
very
beginning.
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
oh!
yes,
they
did,
but
the
sec
was
briefing
the
question
of
mootness
already.
now
this
court
to
the
case
of
weinstein
versus
bradford,
for
example,
which
was
discussed
yesterday.
it
is
true
that
the
trading
suspension
orders
have
expired.
however,
at
the
present
time
there
is
an
order
currently
outstanding
which
is
a
lifetime
bar
against
me
from
being
associated
with
the
securities
dealer.
i
believe
that
i
can
show
through
the
record
which
the
sec
has
refused
to
transmit
that
this
lifetime
bar
was
based
in
part
on
successive
trading
suspension
orders
which
the
court
of
appeals
declared
to
be
illegal.
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
yes,
it
was
because
there
were
two
cases
before
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
consolidated
both
cases,
the
record
is
combined.
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
did
not
mention
what?
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
oh!
it
was
prior
the
same
decision.
the
decision
in
the
court
of
appeals
discussed
two
different
cases,
but
they
were
consolidated.
this
court
when
it
granted
certiorari
only
agreed
to
review
the
issues
pertaining
to
one
of
the
cases,
but
nevertheless
i
claimed
that
the
record
of
both
cases,
since
it
was
a
consolidated
case,
it
should
be
here,
and
i
should
be
allowed
to
cite
documents
in
the
record
of
the
other
case
which
i
think
demonstrate
that
this
case
is
not
moot
in
my
presentation.
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
yes,
what
my
contention
is
precisely
is
that
the
sec
when
they
issued
successive
10-day
suspension
orders,
deducted
from
my
net
capital
certain
securities
which
were
it
failed
to
deliver.
then
they
found
me
retroactively
in
violation
to
the
net
capital
rule,
and
on
the
basis
of
these
findings
that
was
in
violation
in
net
capital
rule,
they
then
barred
me
from
the
securities
business.
if
these
10-day
suspension
orders
were
illegal
on
the
first
place,
i
would
say
that
they
cannot
rely
on
them
to
make
net
capital
deductions
and
therefore
the
order
which
barred
me
for
life
in
the
securities
business,
is
invalid.
there
is
--
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
yes,
because
the
sec
has
released
securities
exchange
act
release
10209,
which
states
that
if
a
broker
is
short
a
security
which
is
suspended
from
trading
by
the
sec,
he
is
required
to
deduct
from
his
net
capital
the
fails
to
deliver
in
suspended
securities,
and
i
in
fact
was
short
at
the
time
in
the
successive
suspension
order
at
a
number
of
occasions,
and
they
deducted
the
fails
to
deliver
in
suspended
securities.
therefore
it
seems
to
me
reasonable
that
if
those
orders
were
illegal
they
cannot
rely
on
them
to
bar
me
from
the
securities
business.
i
have
not
reached
that
point
in
this
case,
i
do
not
know
if
this
court
affirms
the
decision
it
may
be
that
there
would
be
further
proceedings
and
i
lose
on
that
particular
point,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
i
have
the
right
to
make
this
showing
that
they
did
in
fact
rely
on
successive
trading
suspension
orders
to
bar
me
from
the
securities
business.
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
as
in
argument
against
mootness,
this
is
precisely
the
point
because
i
am
here
arguing
the
question
of
mootness.
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
i
know,
there
is
no
proceedings
at
all.
the
sec
claims
that
the
commission
has
--
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
well,
it
was
the
prior
decision
against
the
court
of
appeals.
i
have
not
instituted
any
further
proceedings
for
the
reason
that
the
sec
staff
claims
that
as
long
as
the
case
is
pending
in
the
courts,
the
sec
itself
has
no
jurisdiction
to
review
the
matter
because
the
court
of
appeals
required
exclusive
jurisdiction
with
the
filing
of
the
record.
i
disagree
with
their
contention,
but
as
long
as
they
are
going
to
make
it
--
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
it
may
turn
on
the
result
of
this
case,
i
feel
that.
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
that
is
right.
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
well,
i
did
bring
the
case
here
but
you
denied
certiorari
on
that
case.
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
it
is
over,
but
nevertheless
if
this
court
finds
that
the
sec
acted
illegally
in
issuing
successive
trading
suspension
orders
--
i
think
i
can
go
back
to
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
in
the
first
instance
and
reopen
it,
that
would
be
the
place
i
would
go
to
with
that
particular
claim.
and
that
is
why
i
feel
it
is
critical
to
have
the
record
here
so
that
the
judges
to
this
court
can
look
at
the
record
and
see
that
in
fact
they
did
deduct
from
my
net
capital
certain
sums
in
money
based
on
successive
trading
suspension
orders.
now,
i
will
point
it
out
that
because
of
the
continuing
policy
of
the
sec,
this
case
has
been
going
on
for
a
long
time.
the
specific
orders
which
the
court
of
appeals
vacated
were
not
themselves
used
by
the
sec
as
a
basis
because
by
the
time,
this
case
got
in
the
court
--
this
is
a
third
suit
i
brought
--
by
the
time
this
case
got
before
the
court
of
appeals,
it
was
too
late
to
challenge
those
suspension
orders
because
there
is
a
60-day
limitation
in
section
25
(a)
of
the
securities
exchange
act.
nevertheless
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
makes
it
clear,
i
now
believe,
that
if
you
will
affirm
that
decision
it
will
be
cleared
that
all
these
were
illegal
that
they
have
been
issuing
over
the
past
33
years,
and
this
would
give
me
a
basis
for
going
back
to
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
and
asking
them
to
reopen
the
procedure.
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
no,
this
is
a
new
proceeding,
and
if
i
go
back
to
the
commission
and
start
a
whole
new
proceeding
--
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
i
understand
that
you
did
not
grant
certiorari
in
those
issues.
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
no,
i
do
not
your
honor,
because
--
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
well,
but
--
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
well,
i
am
going
to
agree
that
you
might
possibly
be
right,
but
i
am
not
going
to
concede
that.
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
yes.
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
yes,
but
you
do
have
--
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
you
do
have
the
case
before
you,
even
though
my
petition
was
denied,
and
their
petition
in
the
same
case
was
granted.
i
do
not
think
a
court's
jurisdiction
is
limited.
i
do
not
expect
the
court
to
decide
anything
about
that
case,
but
i
do
not
think
the
court's
jurisdiction
is
limited
to
specific
points
the
sec
has
raised.
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
oh!
no,
i
will
assume
that
you
might
be
right.
i
said
i
do
not
expect
this
court
to
do
anything
with
regard
to
that
matter.
i
just
said
that
only
issue
of
mootness,
which
i
am
briefing
and
arguing
is
that
i
can
demonstrate
that
the
case
is
not
moot
through
the
record.
i
do
not
know
what
is
going
to
happen
if
the
court
of
appeals
grants
my
motion
the
sec
transmits
record
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
that
arrives
here
a
month
from
now
or
so.
it
seems
to
me
this
is
a
very
undesirable
situation
to
be
in.
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
now,
in
the
--
yesterday
the
sec
gave
three
reasons
for
the
trading
suspension
and
they
said
that
this
suspension
was
of
this
length
because
there
were
three
different
things
going
on
and
this
is
the
reason
why
they
had
let
it
for
so
long,
and
one
was
-
market
manipulation,
two
was
-
a
change
in
management,
three
was
-
a
late
10
(k)
filing.
i
want
to
address
the
facts
which
are
in
the
record
with
regard
to
these
three
merits.
the
change
in
management
took
place
at
a
meeting
of
the
board
of
directors
of
canadian
javelin
ltd
on
march
06,
1976.
at
that
time
a
group
headed
by
william
wismer
throughout
the
doyle
group,
throughout
the
management
of
canadian
javelin
ltd.,
fired
mr.
doyle
personally.
this
is
reflected
in
the
march
26
memo
which
is
on
page
104-105
of
the
appendix.
the
10
(k)
delinquency
which
is
another
reason
cited
by
the
sec
occurred
on
march
31,
1976
and
this
can
be
seen
from
page
110
of
the
appendix.
so
prior
to
march
6,
there
were
32
suspension
orders,
prior
to
march
31,
there
were
34
suspension
orders,
this
means
that
the
sec
suspended
trading
for
31
times
because
of
the
market
manipulation,
for
two
more
times
because
of
the
change
in
management,
and
for
another
three
times
because
of
the
lateness
in
the
10
(k)
filing.
the
sec
also
referred
to
a
fugitive
from
justice
yesterday
in
the
argument
that
they
presented.
however,
on
march
6,
1976
mr.
doyle
who
is
a
notorious
fugitive
from
justice,
who
they
are
referring
to,
was
thrown
out
of
the
company,
he
was
fired
personally,
and
the
sec
claims
that
they
suspended
trading
for
that
reason.
on
july
30,
1976,
after
the
suspension
was
listed,
there
was
a
court
order
to
special
meeting
of
directors,
special
meeting
of
stockholder,
which
i
intended,
in
montreal
which
is
also
discussed
in
the
record
because
a
copy
of
the
judge's
order
is
here.
holding
a
special
action
and
at
that
point
doyle
got
back
into
management
and
through
the
wismer
group
out.
so,
now
we
have
a
situation
where
an
individual,
a
toronto
attorney
became
the
president
of
canadian
javelin
ltd.
at
that
point
the
sec
says,
it
suspends
trading;
three
months
later
when
the
fugitive
from
justice
gets
back
and
control
over
the
company,
they
do
not
suspend
trading
and
i
point
this
out
because
i
think
this
demonstrate
really
that
reason
that
it
is
a
fiction.
in
addition
to
that
mr.
justice
powell
yesterday
raised
the
question
of
whether
a
cooperation
has
the
right
to
protest,
to
come
in
and
ask
for
hearing
to
protest
a
trading
suspension?
ironically
it
is
reported
in
the
wall
street
journal
that
at
the
time
of
may
02,
1976
lifting
the
trading
suspension
management
of
canadian
javelin
ltd
petitioned
the
sec
to
continue
the
trading
suspension,
and
incidentally
also,
the
earlier
trading
suspension
which
was
terminated
in
january
1975,
the
management
of
canadian
javelin
again
requested,
a
different
management
requested
that
the
sec
continued
a
trading
suspension
and
filed
a
motion
and
obtained
the
stay
in
the
district
court.
this
illustrates
a
point
that
very
often
the
cooperation
itself
does
not
want
a
trading
suspension,
even
though
it
is
to
the
detriment
of
its
own
stockholders,
because
the
corporate
management
for
their
own
personal
reasons
may
desire
that
trading
not
take
place.
now
in
the
matter
of
the
10
(k),
this
10
(k)
report
became
delinquent
on
march
31,
1976,
as
the
records
state.
i
have
not
known
of
any
case
the
sec
often
suspends
its
trading
because
10
(k)
delinquency,
but
they
do
not
suspend
on
the
day
that
the
10
(k)
became
delinquent,
and
they
do
not
suspend
even
two
months
later
because
the
trading
suspension
here
was
lifted
on
may
02.
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
yes,
that
is
correct.
that
is
--
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
well,
because
they
did
say,
yesterday
that
these
were
the
reasons
that
they
suspended
trading,
and
i
want
to
show
that
there
was
no
rational
basis
for
this.
what
they
have
done
is
make
a
--
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
yes,
i
do
feel
that.
that
is
a
point
which
i
thought
might
be
raised
when
i
went
into
discussion
of
this,
but
--
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
yes,
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
held.
i
just
wanted
to
show
that
the
there
is
not
any
rational
basis
for
the
--
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
no,
i
do
not
make
that
concession.
as
the
amicus
does
make
that
concession,
i
do
not
because
i
do
not
believe
that
the
sec
can
be
allowed
particularly
when
they
do
not
issue
reasons
for
the
trading
suspensions.
therefore
when
they
say
that
we
are
issuing
a
new
suspension
because
we
have
a
new
reason
for
the
suspension,
and
they
have
not
said
that
in
this
case,
but
if
they
said
that
something
simply
new
and
differnt
here
as
a
reason.
what
happened
is
--
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
well,
i
think
if
it
was
the
same
old
thing,
it
clearly
would
be
prohibited
by
the
statute,
and
i
am
saying
even
if
it
was
for
a
different
reason,
it
would
also
be
prohibited.
when
congress
originally
passed
the
permission
in
1934,
there
section
19
(a)
had
had
four
provisions
–
1,
2,
3
and
4,
sections
19
(a)
(1),
(2)
and
(3)
all
required
the
sec
to
give
notice
and
the
opportunity
for
hearing.
only
section
19
(a)
(4)
allowed
the
sec
to
act
similarly
without
notice
and
the
opportunity
for
hearing,
and
both
the
house
and
senate
report
stated
in
1934
that
they
did
not
require
the
sec
to
give
notice
and
opportunity
for
hearing
because
this
was
a
summary
power
to
be
exercised
in
emergency
situation.
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
that
is
correct.
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
well,
that
would
be
under
(inaudible)
section
12
(j)
they
could
after
--
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
that
is
right.
there
had
been
some
instances
this
year
in
which
the
sec
on
three
separate
occasions,
but
not
successive,
has
suspended
trading
in
penn
central
transportation
company
and
a
number
of
subsidiaries.
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
right.
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
yes,
i
would
agree
as
a
statute
has
written
it
does.
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
yes
it
does
permit
that.
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
no,
i
do
not
believe
that
this
is
permitted.
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
well,
i
think
that
this
goes
really
to
a
matter
of
the
intent
of
congress.
congress
did
not
intend
that
the
sec
particularly
if
it
--
since
it
never
issues
reasons
for
strains,
we
do
not
know
if
it
has
new
reason
or
a
different
reason
--
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
that
is
correct.
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
yes,
you
do
sir.
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
well,
section
12
(j)
which
you
are
referring
to
is
actually
a
renumbering,
because
it
was
formerly
called
section
19
(a)
(2),
they
moved
it
over
the
section
12
(j).
the
commission
has
had
the
power
since
1934
to
suspend
the
registration
of
a
security.
now
when
they
enacted
12
(j),
they
included
a
sentence
which,
in
addition
to
renumbering,
they
include
a
sense
which
said
that
would
be
illegal
for
a
broker,
or
dealer
to
buy
or
sell
or
to
use
the
means
of
instrumentalities
of
interstate
commerce
to
affect
a
transaction
in
the
security
whose
registration
has
been
suspended
or
revoked.
so
that
this
makes
it
clear,
although
it
was
clear
already
that
the
sec
could
after
notice
and
a
hearing
suspend
the
registration
which
would
also
suspend
the
trading
in
the
security
under
section
12
(j),
but
they
have
always
had
this
power
since
1934.
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
for
up
to
one
year.
incidentally,
i
would
like
to
mention
that
in
this
case
there
is
--
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
well,
they
have
an
exercise
that
power
under
section
12
(j)
--
they
have
not
provided
notice
and
the
hearing.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
in
this
particular
case,
the
sec
suspended
trading
for
370
days,
which
is
more
than
one
year
therefore
they
actually
suspended
trading
for
more
time
under
section
12
(k)
without
noticing
the
opportunity
for
hearing
then
they
were
permitted
to
suspend
with
notice
and
the
opportunity
for
hearing
under
section
12
(j).
so
what
they
are
saying
is
that
they
can
suspend
trading
for
a
longer
period
of
time
without
notice,
indicating
with
notice,
and
i
am
sure
that
this
could
not
possibly
be
what
congress
intended.
now,
also
yesterday
mr.
justice
powell
asked
whether
the
rollover
proceedings
are
ex
parte?
and
of
course
of
commission
says
that
this
is
not
a
rubber
stamp
procedure
and
the
commission
very
seriously
considers
the
needs
of
investors
and
this
of
thing,
but
again
although
i
do
not
want
to
go
into
the
same
track
that
i
may
have
fallen
and
just
a
second
ago,
i
think
that
the
record
demonstrates
that
the
commission
not
only
is
in
the
rubber
stamp
proceeding,
but
the
commission
itself
plays
no
part
in
the
decision
to
suspend
in
this
record
of
this
case.
the
first
trading
suspension
is
dated
april
29,
1975.
the
memorandum
which
they
have
submitted
as
to
record
of
this
trading
suspension
is
a
memorandum
by
the
staff,
dated
may
02,
1975,
three
days
later.
so
that
it
is
clear
this
is
not
a
memorandum
from
the
commission,
this
is
a
memorandum
from
the
staff
and
it
explains
the
reasons
for
the
trading
suspension.
from
this
it
is
clear
that
the
commissioners
themselves
could
not
have
received
this
memorandum
at
the
time
trading
was
suspended,
and
in
fact
since
the
suspension
orders
are
not
signed
by
the
commissioners,
they
do
not
bear
the
commissioners'
names,
and
we
do
not
even
know
if
the
commissioner
is
new.
the
commissioners
may
have
been
on
vacation
at
some
place,
we
do
not
even
know
that
they
were
in
washington
at
the
time,
they
therefore
did
not
participate
and
perhaps
they
were
read
in
newspaper
said
trading
have
been
suspended
in
canadian
javelin
ltd.,
but
this
is
really
about
all.
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
secretary
of
commission
is
performing
the
ministerial
task
apparently
at
the
direction
of
members
of
the
staff
and
the
commissioners
themselves
are
not
involved.
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
the
market
manipulation
in
this
instance
ended
on
february
12,
1975.
i
have
the
indictment
--
this
is
the
information
that
was
filed
in
canada
by
the
canadian
authorities
and
the
last
watched
trade
that
took
place
which
is
alleged
here
the
406
counts
watched
trade,
the
last
one
took
place
on
february
12,
1975.
and
all
of
the
trades
alleged
here
are
could
on
the
montreal
or
vancouver
stock
exchanges.
now,
in
a
hypothetical
situation
of
what
if
there
is
a
market
manipulation,
i
would
say
that
a
trading
suspension
order
which
holds
trading
for
ten
days
is
sufficient
to
bring
to
an
end
any
market
manipulation,
because
usually
our
market
manipulators,
they
rely
on
certain
things
to
keep
the
price
up.
they
have
the
park
securities.
i
was
a
broker
dealer
for
five
years
and
somehow
i
have
some
idea
of
what
they
do
when
they
manipulate
a
stock,
and
when
a
trading
suspension
comes
along
--
[laughter]
when
a
trading
suspension
comes
along
they
suspend
trading
for
ten
days
and
that
brings
to
an
end
any
market
manipulation.
when
the
stock
opens
for
trading
again
any
stock
in
margin
accounts
almost
always
very
often
is
sold
the
people
who
they
have
got
the
stock
clocked
in
with
almost
always
have
to
get
out
those
investigations
involved.
the
stock
comes
down
and
the
manipulation
is
over
and
in
practice.
and
i
think,
it
could
be
assumed
that
this
would
happen
even
in
theory.
and
i
think
that
this
is
what
congress
had
in
mind.
they
said
that
this
was
an
emergency
power,
they
did
not
say
that
this
was
something
that
commission
could
do
for
more
than
a
year
as
in
this
case
or
for
13
years
as
in
continental
vending
machine
case.
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
the
sec
already
has
a
number
of
remedies
-
they
have
administrative
remedies,
they
have
injunctive
remedies.
if
there
is
some
remedy,
in
addition
to
that
the
appropriate
relief
is
for
them
to
apply
to
congress
for
this
remedy.
congress
has
given
them
section
12
(j)
and
it
stated
in
the
senate
report
1975
that
this
was
intended
to
be
exercised
when
they
wanted
to
suspend
trading
for
a
period
of
extended
duration.
now
they
say
this
is
insufficient
because
many
companies
are
not
registered
because
they
do
not
have
as
much
as
a
million
dollars
in
assets,
and
500
stockholders
which
is
required
by
section
12
(g)
of
the
securities
and
exchange
act.
so
they
say,
many
securities
are
not
registered
therefore
what
is
going
to
happen
in
a
case
of
a
security
which
is
not
registered,
however
we
are
going
to
stop
trading
in
that.
and
i
think
the
answer
is
that
congress
simply
did
not
intend
that
they
should
be
allowed
to
do
this,
because
you
must
remember
that
there
are
many
corporations
which
are
technically,
which
are
traded,
which
are
small
and
which's
public
interest
is
simply
not
sufficient
for
the
sec
to
get
involved.
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
summarily
suspend
trading.
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
no,
we
are
talking
about
securities
which
are
not
registered.
canadian
javelin
is
registered,
so
it
does
not
apply
in
this
case.
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
right.
there
are
companies
which
are
small
corporations,
they
have
less
--
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
well,
with
respect
a
registered
security,
they
can
start
proceeding
under
12
(j)
with
respect
to
a
non
registered
security
--
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
yes,
after
notice
and
hearing.
mr.
samuel
h.
sloan
right.
that
is
what
they
should
have
been
in
this
case,
but
by
the
way
in
this
case
there
was
no
issue
or
misconduct
at
least
according
to
the
indictment
and
according
to
the
sec's
complaint
against
the
canadian,
because
the
sec
filed
a
complaint
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
but
the
defendants
were
doyle
and
its
cohorts,
the
canadian
javelin
ltd.
was
not
named
as
a
defendant.
similarly,
in
the
information
filed
in
canada,
canadian
javelin
ltd.
was
not
a
defendant
so
there
was
no
issuer
misconduct,
therefore
section
12
(j)
could
not
have
been
invoked.
they
make
a
big
point
of
this,
but
i
think
the
remedy
is
to
go
to
congress
and
ask
for
extended
powers
if
that
is
what,
what
they
need.
thank
you
very
much.
