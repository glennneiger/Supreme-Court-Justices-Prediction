stewart
in
this
case
it
is
more
than
well
over
a
year,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
had
been
proceeded
by
another
series
of
suspensions
based
on
different
grounds
for
an
even
longer
period,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
400
and
some
days.
justice
potter
stewart
didn't
you
also
say
earlier
that
not
only
had
congress
approved
your
construction,
but
indeed
had
expended?
justice
potter
stewart
does
an
issuer
have
any
notice
(inaudible).
justice
potter
stewart
could
the
issuer
gradually
on
demand
have
a
hearing
as
to
whether
or
not
the
continuation
of
the
rollover
is
justified?
justice
potter
stewart
no
if
there
is
a
situation
not
covered
by
12
(j).
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
is
need
for
a
suspension
of
more
than
ten
days
and
there
is
probable
cause
to
prove
all
sorts
of
violations
of
the
statute.
what
would
you
do,
would
you
just
use
the
ten
day
power
or
would
you
have
gone
to
court?
justice
potter
stewart
what
therefore
would
be
the
prior
of
the
injunction
or
the
injunction
necessarily
stop
trading?
justice
potter
stewart
and
therefore
the
prayer
of
the
injunction
would
be
designed
to
terminate
the
alleged
manipulation
on
the
marketplace,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
injunction
would
necessarily
include
a
prayer
that
all
trading
would
be
suspended,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
what
have
they
complained
in
this
case
as
for
an
injunction
or
declaratory
judgment
or
money
damages
or
all
three
or
what?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
in
the
commission
or
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
he
took
that
as
a
lesson
never
to
try
that
rule
again.
[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
the
court
raised
the
question
of
mootness.
justice
potter
stewart
but
did
not
the
court
ask
the
parties
to
brief
the
question
of
mootness?
justice
potter
stewart
stopgap.
