mr.
ed
bolding
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
a
few
differences
with
my
brother
regarding
the
facts
of
this
case
as
pointed
out
originally
by
mr.
neely.
number
one,
there
was
no
short
length
of
voir
dire
by
the
prosecutor
of
this
jury
panel
regarding
their
knowledge
of
the
reasons
for
a
new
trial.
the
trial
judge
gave
the
prosecutor
all
of
the
time
that
the
prosecutor
wanted
to
inquire
into
this
jury
panel's
mind
to
see
whether
they,
number
one
knew
the
reason
for
the
granting
of
the
new
trial
and
number
two
whether
that
would
prejudice
their
position,
their
feelings
in
this
case.
mr.
ed
bolding
yes
your
honor.
mr.
ed
bolding
both
sides,
individual
question
by
the
jurors
outside
of
the
presence
of
all
of
the
jurors,
that
was
fully
inquired
into
your
honor
at
the
request
of
the
prosecutor
incidentally.
number
two,
the
petitioner
here
your
honors
omits
the
fact
that
the
type
of
statement
made
by
defense
counsel
in
this
particular
case
was
made
in
a
context
of
varying
statements
made
by
the
prosecutor
and
by
the
defense
counsel,
all
through
the
voir
dire,
all
through
their
opening
statement.
the
prosecutor
over
objection
and
with
a
motion
for
mistrial
following
it
stated
four
years
ago
there
were
other
proceedings,
prior
proceedings,
four
years
ago
would
you
as
jurors
hold
that
against
us
that
some
of
these
people
might
not
be
able
to
remember
things
after
four
years
will
have
transcript
to
these
prior
proceedings.
mr.
ed
bolding
your
honor,
in
my
opinion
they
knew
already,
but
yes
i
believe
that
is
correct.
mr.
ed
bolding
i
think
there
is
no
question
at
all
your
honor.
mr.
ed
bolding
your
honor,
the
--
i
do
not
use
that
as
justification,
as
that
particular
part
of
it
as
justification
for
defense
counsel.
mr.
ed
bolding
yes
sir.
mr.
ed
bolding
from
the
testimony
from
the
witnesses
your
honor,
from
testimony
of
the
witnesses.
rhe
county
attorney
in
this
particular
case,
not
the
present
county
attorney
your
honor,
county
attorney
in
this
particular
case
engaged
in
a
course
of
conduct
which
was
specific
misconduct
as
held
by
the
supreme
court
of
arizona,
including
--
mr.
ed
bolding
your
honor,
that
is
part
of
the
penalty
that
they
paid,
yes
sir.
mr.
ed
bolding
yes,
your
honor
that
would
be
admissible
for
many
reasons.
number
one
in
arizona,
the
law
is
a
bit
different
than
many
of
the
other
states.
there
is
a
broad
scope
of
cross
examination
allowing
impeachment
concerning
bias,
prejudice,
motive,
interest
of
prosecution
and
its
witnesses
just
like
a
defendant
who
goes
out
and
tries
to
wire
up
a
witness
or
tries
to
get
someone
to
say
something
that
is
not
true
so
can
the
state,
so
can
the
defendant
prove
that
against
the
state
your
honor,
we
submit.
we
can
--
mr.
ed
bolding
yes
your
honor,
absolutely
and
for
the
--
mr.
ed
bolding
no
sir,
your
honor
they
did
not
make
the
ruling
in
that
area.
they
declined
to
accept
jurisdiction
of
the
special
action
and
on
the
habeas
filed
with
arizona
supreme
court,
it
was
denied
without
an
opinion,
so
we
do
not
know
what
they
thought.
mr.
ed
bolding
no
your
honor.
evidently
he
did
not,
although
i
cannot
say
that
for
sure.
we
did
not
present
to
the
trial
judge
because
may
i
add
this.
there
was
a
motion
for
mistrial
denied,
absolutely
denied.
two
more
--
two
witnesses
presented.
then
the
next
morning
a
rule
314
and
mr.
chief
justice
i
must
enter
here
that
that
rule
was
not
in
affect
at
that
time,
rule
314.
this
was
an
old
rules
case.
arizona
has
new
criminal
rules.
this
second
case
was
began
after
the
new
rules
were
in
affect,
but
used
the
old
rules.
however,
that
old
rule
314
unknown
to
defense
counsel
at
that
time
was
in
two
thirds
part
declared
to
be
unconstitutional
and
so
the
trial
judge
gave
defense
counsel
15
minutes
the
next
morning
to
research
the
area.
the
burruell
case
was
not
cited
to
the
trial
judge
and
i
like
to
say
–
i
like
to
quote
shortly
from
the
state
v.
burruell,
arizona
supreme
court
case
to
show
you
what
kind
of
things
would
be
considered
proper
by
the
supreme
court.
the
supreme
court
said
this
argument,
this
opening
statement
was
proper,
(inaudible)
ladies
and
gentlemen.
mr.
ed
bolding
yes
your
honor.
simply
for
the
reason
that
i
think
that
does
not
go
far
enough
in
inquiring
to
the
facts
of
a
particular
case
which
is
what
the
ninth
circuit
held
should
be
done
in
this
case.
mr.
ed
bolding
your
honor.
i
am
sorry,
it
is
my
understanding
that
they
did.
mr.
ed
bolding
i
believe
your
honor
that
the
ninth
circuit
said,
number
one
we
would
like
to
see
something
about
manifest
necessity
or
some
kind
of
findings.
number
two
we
would
like
to
have
the
trial
court
have
considered
some
alternatives
to
adjust
a
declaration
of
mistrial
and
number
three
not
withstanding
all
of
that
and
in
the
concurring
opinion,
justice
marshall,
the
two
members
concurring
and
i
think
that
might
probably
the
ruling
that
we
look
at
said,
we
do
not
know.
mr.
ed
bolding
yes
sir,
alright.
there
is
--
the
two
judges
there
--
mr.
ed
bolding
yes
sir.
the
two
judges
in
the
concurring
opinion
though
said
we
do
not
know
what
was
in
the
trial
judge's
mind
because
here
was
a
motion
for
mistrial
denied.
then
the
prosecutor
comes
in
with
a
new
rule.
mr.
ed
bolding
your
honor,
i
believe
they
say
in
their
--
in
the
opinion
that
based
on
the
record
they
cannot
tell
whether
the
judge
relied
on
314.
mr.
ed
bolding
alright
sir,
i
am
misunderstanding
you
then
and
i
perhaps
--
mr.
ed
bolding
i
believe
they
stated
your
honor
that
they
wanted
some
basis
for
the
ruling
by
the
by
the
--
mr.
ed
bolding
they
wanted
and
i
believe
they
did
state
that
and
as
did
the
district
judge
that
the
record
just
did
not
reflect.
mr.
ed
bolding
yes.
your
honor
i
would
have
to
rescan
that.
i
believe
that
what
you
say
is
maybe
correct.
it
was
my
understanding
that
they
did.
mr.
ed
bolding
well,
your
honor
if
that
was
the
rule
than
that
would
affectly
wipe
out
the
right
of
the
defendant
to
have
an
appellate
review
of
that
particular
--
mr.
ed
bolding
well,
perhaps
sir
and
i
just
feel
that
that
would
effectively
preclude
appellate
review
and
the
appellate
review
in
the
ninth
circuit
did
sustain
judge
walsh
at
the
district
court
level.
judge
walsh
at
the
district
court
level
did
take
a
look
specifically
at
the
record
--
mr.
ed
bolding
your
honor,
i
think
a
rereading
perhaps
of
what
judge
walsh
said
was
that
he
would
not
have,
in
essence
he
would
not
have
declared
the
mistrial
because
he
could
not
see
from
the
record
that
it
would
have
been
supported.
however,
he
would
also
like
some
findings
by
the
trial
judge.
that
is
what
judge
walsh
said
in
my
opinion
sir
from,
from
reading
that
opinion.
your
honors,
i
think
an
example
of
what
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
says
is
proper
opening
statement.
we
will
prove
that
the
county
attorney's
office
has
knowledge
of
this
narcotics
running.
we
will
prove
this
from
officers
of
the
pima
county
sheriff's
office
in
the
city
of
tucson
police
department.
we
will
prove
they
investigated
mr.
lugo.
we
will
prove
that
they
presented
a
case
to
the
county
attorney's
office,
but
one
case
we
will
try
to
show
is
(inaudible).
we
will
try
it
right
here
in
this
courtroom,
we
will
show
that
the
county
attorney's
office
refused
to
prosecute
the
state
witness.
we
will
show
that
mr.
lugo
is
under
these
acts.
these
acts
of
a
criminal
charge
being
placed
against
him
putting
him
in
jail,
removing
him
from
his
heroin.
we
will
show
the
interest
of
the
state
witness
in
testifying,
as
you
will
surely
hear
him
testify
that
he
received
a
bonus.
we
will
show
you
that
he
went
on
the
payroll
and
finally
when
it's
all
over
we
will
prove
to
you
that
the
defendant
was
not
guilty.
that
is
the
type
of
opening
statement
that
is
specifically
approved
by
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
in
state
v.
burruell
and
for
those
reasons
and
the
reasons
previously
stated,
including
your
honor,
the
opening
of
the
door
by
the
prosecutor
talking
about
these
prior
proceedings,
we
say
that
while
the
courts
have
held
and
so
it
is
a
hard
position
for
me
to
argue
that
this
is
not
improper
words
that
these
words
that
were
added
were
not
improper
at
there
termination,
it
is
hard
position
for
me
to
argue
that
since
the
judges
have
said
the
other
way,
still
the
law
is
there.
we
feel
that
the
prosecutor
opened
the
door
by
talking
about
these
prior
prosecutions
and
this
is
one
thing
that
was
omitted
from
the
fact
presentation
here
of
course.
after
the
prior
proceedings
mentioned,
after
trial
talked
about,
then
the
prosecutor
also
talked
about
the
fact
that
there
was
a,
a
preliminary
hearing
with
a
magistrate
who
filed
an
information
or
an
information
filed
based
upon
the
magistrate's
ruling.
now,
you
are
not
hearing
a
claim
before
you
today
that
the
words
of
the
prosecutor
at
that
particular
time
were
improper.
mr.
ed
bolding
yes
your
honor.
it
is
in
the
–
it
may
not
be
in
the
opinion
itself,
but
it
is
in
the
appendix
regarding
judge
walsh's
the
district
court's
ruling
and
his
colloquy
with
the
prosecutor
at
that
time.
mr.
ed
bolding
no.
mr.
ed
bolding
no,
because
that
point
was
not
taken
up
on
appeal
in
any
manner.
mr.
ed
bolding
that
opens
the
door
your
honor
to
the
defense
counsel's
last
statements.
mr.
ed
bolding
well
sir.
mr.
ed
bolding
well,
it
is
our
contention
your
honor
that
that
is
exactly
what
--
one
of
the
reasons
for
allowing
this
type
of
a,
of
a
statement.
in
other
words,
the
prosecutor
was
according
to
the
finding
by
the
supreme
court,
the
arizona
supreme
court
in
its
original
opinion.
the
finding
that
the
case
should
be
upheld
by
the
trial
court
if
there
was
a
misconduct
of
the
county
attorney
and
that
opinion
your
honor
which
you
have
states
fully
or
semi-fully
the
facts
upon
which
that
conclusion
was
based.
mr.
ed
bolding
yes,
your
honor
and
that
is
--
mr.
ed
bolding
well,
your
honor
that
is
under
48
(c),
rule
48
(c)
this
is
law
of
the
case.
it
is
a
memorandum
opinion
which
may
not
be
cited
by
another
in
another
case
at
another
time,
but
this
is
specifically
under
48
(c).
it
has
a
provision
saying
that
it
is
the
law
of
the
case
notwithstanding
and
so
that
is
why
we
feel
that
we
are
entitled
to
cite
it
here
your
honor.
mr.
ed
bolding
no.
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
they
were
washed
out
when
the
new
trial
was
granted.
of
course,
what
we
are
getting
at
in
part
here
i
thought
was
the
fact
that
the
county
attorney
is
saying
well
he
had
no
right
to
say
what
he
said
and
that
you
therefore
should
take
a
look
at
--
mr.
ed
bolding
yes
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
correct.
we
feel
that
the
background
is
a
part
of
the
determination
as
to
--
because
you
have
to
take
the
defense
counsel's
conduct
in
context
as
it
happened
during
the
trial.
mr.
ed
bolding
well
your
honor,
i
mentioned
that
i
think
that
is
an
integral
part
of
it
and
i
think
that
that
is
adequately
covered
in
the
brief
also.
the
evidence
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice
that
you
have
mentioned
could
have
come
in
regarding
credibility
of
the
witnesses,
in
particularly
--
in
particular
the
chief
detective
of
the
--
handling
this
case
and
it
is
cited
down
at
page
8
of
our
brief,
talks
about
the
fact
that
there
is
in
response
to
a
question
by
a
defense
counsel
at
another
hearing
talks
about
the
fact
that
there
is
a
number
of
times
when
i
talk
to
you
mr.
defense
counsel
when
i
really
do
not
tell
you
the
truth.
this
is
the
type
of
credibility
that
we
would
be
getting
into
with
this
testimony
and
we
feel
that
arizona
law
clearly
--
allows
us
to
go
into
that,
that
type
of
testimony
your
honor
and
that
type
of
statement
in
the
voir
dire
and
in
the
opening.
mr.
ed
bolding
burruell.
mr.
ed
bolding
yes
your
honor.
it
is
our
contention
and
to
please
the
court
that
the
opinion
of
the
ninth
circuit
accurately
states
what
happened
here.
the
opinion
of
the
ninth
circuit
says
we
do
not
really
know
what
happened.
why
the
trial
judge
granted
the
mistrial.
it
could
have
been
because
he,
as
shown
in
the
concurring
opinion,
it
could
have
been
because
he
was
cited
this
rule
314
which
as
i
stated
before
in
two
of
its
sentences,
two
out
of
its
three
sentences
was
held
to
be
unconstitutional
and
which
was
not
in
affect
at
that
time,
which
was
the
old
rule
that
was
in
affect
for
this
case
only.
however,
we
recognize
that
it
was
in,
upon
research
that
it
was
in
effect
at
this
particular
time.
the
ninth
circuit
says
maybe
or
it
is
as
possible
for
the
trial
judge
to
have
ruled
that
the
remark
was
error,
therefore,
we
have
to
have
a
mistrial,
as
it
was
for
the
trial
judge
to
have
looked
at
the
record,
considered
everything,
just
determined
that
there
was
a
manifest
necessity
for
a
mistrial
for
a
new
trial.
the
ninth
circuit
we
submit
your
honor
states
the
situation
very
accurately.
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
the
ninth
circuit
used
a
totality
of
circumstances
test
in
which
one
of
the
factors
considered
was
whether
a
finding
of
manifest
necessity
was
made
or
whether
there
was
a
consideration
to
the
alternatives
to
the
mistrial.
the
court
expressly
said
it
did
not
require
the
recitation
of
these
talismanic
words
manifest
necessity,
but
said
that
of
review
that
they
–
that
their
record
reflected
that
the
trial
court
did
not
make
any
such
finding
and
did
not
consider
any
alternatives.
the
court
did
not
express
that
any
impropriety
by
the
defense
counsel
was
of
the
magnitude
that
it
would
prevent
the
jury
from
the
arriving
at
fair
and
impartial
verdict
and
in
the
concurring
opinion
sir,
it
was
stated
that
there
was
no
explicit
or
implicit
finding
of
manifest
necessity.
it
was
stated
that
a
greater
part
of
their
argument
was
devoted
to
whether
the
defense
counsel's
remarks
were
improper
and
whether
the
supreme
court's
decision
could
be
brought
to
the
jury's
attention.
when
the
motion
was
first
argued
the
--
mr.
ed
bolding
i
am
sorry.
mr.
ed
bolding
yes
it
did.
mr.
ed
bolding
well
your
honor,
it
was
granted
only
without
any
additional
matters
being
brought
to
the
trial
judge's
attention.
only
with
the
additional
thought
of
this
rule
314
which
says
do
not
talk
about
the
previous
conviction
in
essence
and
that
was
when
the
mistrial
was
granted.
mr.
ed
bolding
yes.
mr.
ed
bolding
yes
your
honor,
to
an
extent.
mr.
ed
bolding
i
think
that
this
judge
thought
your
honor
that
because
of
rule
314
which
says
do
not
talk
about
the
previous
conviction,
because
that
mentioned,
that
therefore,
there
was
error,
and
therefore,
the
mistrial
was
granted
because
he
did
previously
say
--
mr.
ed
bolding
yes
sir.
i
am
saying
that
he
previously
stated
that
--
mr.
ed
bolding
no
sir.
all
i
want
them
to
state
is
what
the
--
on
what
basis
they
are
granting
the
mistrial?
why
they
are
granting
a
mistrial?
mr.
ed
bolding
well,
it
is
a
serious
problem
and
one
that
perhaps
this
court
could
address,
although
we
feel
that
this
is
not
the
case
in
which
a
broad,
a
policy
decision
needs
to
be
made
because
of
the
ruling
of
the
ninth
circuit,
because
of
the
rule
314
that
was
--
that
the
ninth
circuit
talked
about
and
we
still
feel
that
a
good
rule
to
follow
and
one
which
is
being
talked
about
by
--
mr.
ed
bolding
no
sir,
i
do
not.
mr.
ed
bolding
probably,
if
you
went
on
that
particular
point,
it
could
well
be
sir.
mr.
ed
bolding
i
think
he
granted
the
mistrial
because
of
the
mention
of
the
granting
of
the
former
mistrial,
a
new
trial,
i
am
sorry
and
because
of
rule
314
of
the
arizona
rules.
mr.
ed
bolding
yes
sir.
mr.
ed
bolding
well,
only
because
of
the
sequence
of
events
in
which
that
happened
and
that
is
granting
--
the
mistrial
motion
denied,
previous
discussion
about
the
admissibility
of
whether
the
supreme
court
agreed
that
the
new
trial
should
be
granted
and
then
the
granting
of
the
mistrial
after
the
rule
was
shown
to
the
judge.
it
was
that
simple
your
honor
and
we
submit
that
--
mr.
ed
bolding
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
ed
bolding
there
had
not
been
that
far
–
thus
far
in
the
trial,
yes
your
honor,
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
ed
bolding
it
was
the
defense
that
made
the
first
motion
for
a
mistrial
upon
the
prosecutor's
improper
remarks,
we
feel
were
improper
remarks
and
the
objection
later
on
to
the
prosecutor's
remarks
about
the
magistrate
in
the
preliminary
hearing
again
and
objection
again
overruled.
mr.
ed
bolding
he
could
have
sir,
but
we
submit
that
we
we
do
not
know
that.
we
do
not
know
what
he
found.
we
know
only
the
sequence
of
events
sir.
thank
you
very
much.
