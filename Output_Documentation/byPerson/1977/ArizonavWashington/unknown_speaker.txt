mr.
bolding,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
reach
this
point
at
all.
court
of
appeals
did
not
look
at
the
records
to
see
if
they
if
it
would
have
supported
any
kind
of
a
finding
manifest
necessity.
unknown
speaker
well
i
thought
they
just
said
that
the
court
--
that
the
district
court
had
not
made
the
findings
that
were
necessary
and
they
set
it
aside?
unknown
speaker
where
did
they
go
on
and
say
that
if
there
had
been
a
finding
of
manifest
necessity
the
record
would
not
have
sustained
it?
unknown
speaker
now,
that
is
--
that
is
different.
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
trial
judge
had
said
and
may
--
and
now
the
--
all
of
the
right
rule
and
made
the
findings,
would
you
think
it
would
have
been
sustain
--
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
say
the
record
would
not
have
sustained
that
sort
of
the
approach?
unknown
speaker
exactly,
they
want
the
trial
judge
do
it
first.
they
did
not
do
it
themselves?
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
i
thought.
i
had
understood,
perhaps
i
am
wrong,
but
issue
here
was
whether
or
not
the
court
of
appeals
who
is
correct
in
saying
that
the
district
court,
the
district
court
erred
in
not
making
findings
and
in
stating
the
standard
of
the
legal
standard
and
if
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
in
making
that
decision,
we
would
simply
tell
the
court
of
appeals
that
they
were
wrong
in
doing
that,
make
it
go
on
and
look
at
the
record
themselves?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
rule
here
--
what
is
the
rule
were
that
when
a
record
is
silent,
wholly
silent
as
to
the
legal
standard
involved
and
the
findings
and
no
express
findings
had
been
made,
i
suppose
the
rule
is
that
a
state
judge
at
least
it
will
be
presumed
that
the
state
judge
applied
the
right
legal
standards
and
made
the
necessary
findings
in
his
own
mind
at
least,
although
he
did
not
write
it
down,
what
if
that
was
the
rule?
unknown
speaker
no
it
would
not
--
then
the
court
of
appeals
would
look
at
the
record
and
see
if
the
facts
were
sufficient
facts
in
the
record
to
sustain
the
â€“
it
is
a
presume
finding?
unknown
speaker
nobody
else
can.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bolding
is
there
one
arizona
case
that
most
clearly
supports
your
view
that
this
testimony
about
the
prosecution
suppressing
the
evidence
of
the
witness
who
saw
the
man
run
away
that
that
would
have
been
admissible
as
a
preachment?
what
is
the
strongest
case
you
have
got
to
that
preposition?
unknown
speaker
burruell?
unknown
speaker
well,
was
the
mistrial
motion
argued
at
all,
was
that
it?
unknown
speaker
and
did
people
talk
about
what
the
rules
were?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
--
are
you
suggesting
that
the
judge
was
ignorant
as
what
the
controlling
standard
for
a
mistrial
was?
unknown
speaker
so
you
are
suggesting
that
he
was
ignorant
of
the
controlling
federal
standards,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
judges
have
to
say
what
the
standard
is
in
order
to
avoid
being
thought
to
be
ignorant?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
you
got
up
and
said
--
in
argument
and
said
judge
the
only
way
you
can
grant
this
mistrial
is
if
you
follow
perez.
the
judge
says
i
know
that
and
that
he
just
grants
the
motion
for
a
mistrial.
