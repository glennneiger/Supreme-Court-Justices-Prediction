mr.
stephen
d.
neely
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
here
in
this
matter
on
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeal,
granted
by
this
court
on
april
18,
1977,
pursuant
to
28
united
states
code
and
section
1254.
the
case
involves
ultimately
the
question
of
whether
the
state
is
barred
from
retrying
george
washington
junior
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution.
it
involves
more
precisely
a
factual
situation,
involving
the
granting
of
a
mistrial
by
state
trial
judge
without
the
defendants
consent
because
of
improper
remarks
made
by
the
defense
counsel
in
his
opening
statement.
the
issue
being,
whether
the
state
is
properly
barred
from
retrying
the
defendant
in
federal
habeas
proceedings
solely
because
of
the
trial
judge's
failure
to
make
specific
findings
based
on
the
standard
set
out
enjoin
regarding
his
actions.
the
facts
are
lengthy
and
have
been
in
dispute
throughout
this
matter.
essentially
george
washington
junior
is
presently
in
a
custody
of
sheriff
boykin,
sheriff
of
pima
county,
arizona
accused
of
the
murder
of
one
james
hamphill.
he
was
originally
tried
and
convicted
of
this
offense
in
may
of
1971.
he
was
granted
a
new
trial
in
june
of
1973.
the
basis
for
granting
of
the
new
trial
was
the
state's
failure
to
comply
with
this
court's
ruling
in
the
brady
case.
ultimately
a
denial
of
due
process
was
found
and
the
new
trial
was
granted
on
the
grounds
of
newly
discovered
evidence.
the
state
appealed
that
matter.
in
that
decision
of
the
arizona
supreme
court,
the
arizona
supreme
court
affirmed
the
finding
of
the
trial
court
in
june
of
1974
in
a
memorandum
opinion.
the
fact
that
it
was
a
memorandum
opinion
becomes
important
later
during
the
course
of
the
facts.
a
new
trial
was
held
in
maryland
in
january
of
1975,
shortly
following
the
defendant's
notion
for
continuance
on
the
grounds
that
you
did
not
have
all
his
witnesses
ready
and
unable
to
go
to
trial.
mr.
stephen
d.
neely
no
your
honor,
judge
truman
was
not
and
there
were
--
mr.
stephen
d.
neely
yes,
your
honor.
shortly
after
the
commencement
of
the
trial,
there
was
questioning
on
voir
dire
of
the
jury
engaged
them
by
the
prosecutor,
in
the
case
mr.
butler,
regrading
credibility
of
witnesses
wherein
reference
was
made
to
the
possible
use
of
transcripts
from,
and
i
use
his
term,
two
prior
proceedings.
at
the
end
of
that
time,
the
counsel
for
the
defense
moved
for
a
mistrial
on
the
grounds
that
the
reference
to
prior
proceedings
was
prejudiced
over
the
defendant
and
that
notion
was
denied.
shortly
thereafter
defense
counsel
commenced
his
voir
dire.
at
that
time
informed
the
panel
that
the
defendant
had
in
fact
been
previously
tried
for
the
offense,
had
in
fact
been
convicted
of
the
offense
and
had
in
fact
spent
some
time
in
the
prison,
in
the
state
of
arizona.
sometime
subsequent
to
that
there
was
some
indication
by
the
trial
court
judge
about
his
concern
about
the
poisoning
of
the
panel
in
this
matter,
a
request
by
the
prosecutor
to
conduct
individual
voir
dire
which
was
conducted
at
short
length
to
determine
whether
or
not
in
fact
any
of
the
prospective
jurors
were
aware
of
the
reason
behind
the
granting
of
the
original
in
trial.
subsequently,
the
opening
argument
or
opening
statement
commenced.
during
the
course
of
the
opening
statement
given
by
the
defense
counsel,
there
were
comments
regarding
misconduct
by
the
prosecutor's
comments
regarding
the
prosecutor's
willful
withholding
the
evidence,
the
removal
of
the
previous
prosecutor
from
the
case,
apparently
as
a
result
of
this
and
finally
there
was
a
comment
to
the
effect
that
the
jury
was
told
that
they
would
hear
that
because
of
these
things
the
arizona
supreme
court
granted
a
new
trial
in
maryland.
the
lunch
recess
was
held
shortly
thereafter.
there
was
a
motion
made
by
the
prosecutor
in
the
case
for
a
mistrial.
the
grounds
for
that
motion
were
that
due
to
the
improper
statements
of
defense
counsel,
the
jury
had
been
prejudiced.
the
trial
court
listened
to
the
argument,
quite
lengthy
argument
regarding
the
propriety
of
granting
a
mistrial
at
that
point,
based
upon
the
comments
made
by
defense
counsel
indicated
some
reluctance
to
rule
at
that
time
on
the
admissibility
of
the
matter
referred
to
regarding
the
supreme
court,
denied
the
notion
and
granted
the
prosecutor
read
through
--
the
opportunity
to
reopen
the
notion
at
a
later
time.
the
court
at
that
time
expressed
some
concern
about
the
case
turning
into
one
in
which
the
county
attorney's
office
was
being
put
on
trial.
after
that,
two
witnesses
were
called
to
testify
and
did
in
fact
testify.
the
following
morning
after
further
research
on
the
matter,
the
prosecutor
again
moved
for
a
mistrial
citing
two
errors
on
the
rules,
one
of
which
precludes
reference
to
a
past
trial
at
a
new
trial,
the
other
of
which
forbids
the
citation
of
memorandum
opinions,
as
i
mentioned
earlier
the
opinion
sustaining
the
finding
of
a
need
for
a
new
trial
by
the
arizona
supreme
court
was
a
memorandum
opinion.
there
was
again
extensive
argument
during
which
the
subject
of
manifest
necessity
was
raised,
during
which
both
counsels
argued
on
a
possible
question
of
tainting
the
jury
panel
by
the
statements
made
by
defense
counsel
and
as
well
defense
counsel
suggested
the
possibility
of
curative
admonition
and
the
state
argued
against
it
by
virtue
of
what
it
deemed
to
be
the
prejudice
to
the
jury
as
a
result
of
defense
counsel.
mr.
stephen
d.
neely
i
am
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
d.
neely
not
originally,
this
is
the
original
case
took
place
--
mr.
stephen
d.
neely
yes,
your
honor
and
that
rule
regrading
the
memorandum
opinion
is
still
in
effect
that
they
are
not
considered
citation
for
the
purposes
of
authority,
other
than
within
very
limited
circumstances
they
have
been
referred
by
the
ninth
circuit
your
honor.
ultimately,
after
the
extensive
argument
was
concluded
for
the
second
time,
the
court
indicated
that
it
was
ready
to
rule
and
essentially
rule
that
the
mistrial
was
going
to
be
granted
based
upon
defendants
remarks
concerning
arizona
supreme
court
case.
subsequently,
there
was
special
action
filed
by
washington's
counsel,
challenging
the
ruling
of
the
court,
that
special
action
was
filed
with
the
arizona
supreme
court
who
declined
jurisdiction.
our
special
action
ruling
incorporates
all
three
of
the
extraordinary
writs
and
presumably
this
is
in
the
nature
of
either
cert
or
prohibition.
the
following
step
was
to
file
a
motion
to
quash
the
information
in
the
superior
court.
this
was
heard
by
judge
birdsaw
and
denied
and
sometime
during
this
period
counsel
had
also
filed
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
with
the
federal
court
and
had
been
told
that
a
state
remedy
is
yet
being
exhausted.
the
ultimate
step
in
state
court
was
the
filing
of
a
habeas
petition
to
the
arizona
supreme
court
again
challenging
our
right
to
put
mr.
washington
on
trial
again.
that
petition
was
denied
and
finally
the
matter
was
undertaken
by
the
federal
district
court.
during
the
course
of
the
proceedings
before
the
federal
district
court,
judge
walsh
raised
on
his
own
motion,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
findings
of
the
trial
court
reflected
a
manifest
necessary
or
reflected
that
the
trial
court
had
specifically
found
that
there
was
jury
prejudice
involved.
the
court
indicated
that
there
had
been
a
rather
extensive
review
of
the
record
by
himself
prior
to
asking
this
question
and
indicated
in
effect
that
his
main
question
that
remained
was
whether
the
findings
indicating
at
the
same
time
that
if
the
findings
were
there
to
the
effect
that
the
court
had
found
a
manifest
necessity
before
granting
mistrial
or
had
found
jury
prejudice
that
that
would
settle
it
and
i
use
his
terms
for
him.
mr.
stephen
d.
neely
i
apologize
your
honor.
this
is
we
are
now
in
the
district
court
in
the
federal
habeas
petition
and
judge
walsh
is
the
one
who
indicated
that
he
had
reviewed
the
record
and
essentially
raised
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
had
been
specific
findings
with
regard
to
either
manifest
necessity
being
existent
or
with
regard
to
jury
prejudice
being
existent,
indicated
that
he
felt
under
ordinary
circumstances
after
his
review
of
the
record
that
if
a
trial
judge
had
thought
so
that
he
should
have
said
so.
and
essentially
at
that
point
said
in
his
own
words
that
would
settle
it
for
me.
one
he
had
a
rule
that
habeas
should
follow,
the
case
was
then
taken
to
the
ninth
circuit
court
and
the
ninth
circuit
court
again
based
it's
ruling
in
affirming
the
district
court
on
the
fact
that
there
had
been
no
specific
findings
by
the
trial
court
with
respect
to
the
question
of
manifest
necessity,
with
respect
to
the
question
of
alternatives
available
to
the
jury.
mr.
stephen
d.
neely
under
these
circumstances?
mr.
stephen
d.
neely
you
mean
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
here?
mr.
stephen
d.
neely
i
had
a
great
deal
of
difficultly
in
understanding
the
purpose
of
the
concurring
opinion.
it
addresses
itself
to
the
question
that
there
was
a
great
deal
of
argument
at
the
time
of
the
original
trial,
at
second
trial
in
superior
court
before
judge
buchanan
regarding
impropriety.
it
had
appeared
to
me
at
that
time
that
that
was
a
logical
partially
argument
to
take,
but
the
ninth
circuit's
concurring
opinion
did
not
seem
to
think
so.
mr.
stephen
d.
neely
that
is
correct,
there
is
no
question
about
that
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
d.
neely
well,
i
do
not
think
that
the
impact
of
the
two
opinions
is
substantially
different,
but
i
believe
that
we
are
properly
here
on
the
basis
of
the
original
opinion,
that
was
not
noted
to
be
a
concurring
opinion.
mr.
stephen
d.
neely
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
our
position
at
this
point
that
there
are
number
of
issues
that
are
before
this
court,
but
that
the
first
issue
that
must
be
addressed
by
the
court
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
was
proper
for
either
the
district
court
or
the
ninth
circuit
to
conclude
that
in
the
absence
of
specific
findings
by
the
trial
court,
that
they
were,
therefore,
prohibited
from
upholding
the
state's
position
and
denying
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
our
position
here
today
is
that,
this
goes
one
step
beyond
previous
requirements
of
this
court
in
the
sense
that
this
court
has
specifically
maintained
in
the
past
that
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
mistrial
is
properly
granted,
is
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
trial
court
has
abused
this
discretion.
the
court
has
consistently
maintained
from
the
days
of
present
onward
that
it
requires
a
consideration
of
all
the
circumstances
which
in
our
judgment
would
certainly
make
the
finding
of
facts
dealing
with
all
the
circumstances.
some
are
on
us
with
the
trial
court,
but
in
any
there
has
never
to
my
knowledge
been
holding
that
specifically
says,
that
the
position
of
the
court
cannot
be
upheld
and
jeopardy
must
by
necessity
attach
precluding
retrial
merely
because
the
trial
judge
failed
to
make
specific
finding
of
fact
on
these
issues
presented
of
manifest
necessity
and
the
question
of
alternatives.
when
the
records
clearly
supports
the
fact,
there
was
extensive
argument
in
the
case,
that
the
trial
court
expressed
on
more
than
one
occasion
in
this
instance,
his
concern
over
the
possibility
of
poisoning
the
panel,
his
concern
over
the
possibility
of
the
county
attorneys
office
being
put
on
trial
and
clearly
his
concern
over
the
impropriety
of
comments
made
by
the
defense
counsel
to
the
jury.
the
arguments
of
the
counsel
were
likely
at
one
point
the
trial
court
deny
the
motion
for
a
mistrial,
giving
leave
to
reopen
it,
which
indicates
certainly
that
he
was
not
taking
his
responsibility
lightly
and
finally
upon
ultimate
argument
granted
the
motion
for
a
mistrial
because
of
the
impropriety
remarks
and
presumably
the
circumstances
surrounding.
i
think
that
the
essence
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
immediately
below,
is
such
that
it
requires
the
trial
court
essentially
to
make
lists,
if
you
were
of
findings,
which
taken
at
face
value
would
relieve
the
a
appellate
courts
of
the
opportunity
of
going
into
the
record.
it
has
never
been
my
understanding
nor
do
i
read
that
in
the
cases
that
had
been
decided
by
this
court,
that
when
the
question
of
an
abusive
discretion,
particularly
involving
double
jeopardy
is
involved,
that
the
appellate
court
is
precluded
merely
by
conclusary
findings
of
fact
by
the
trial
court
from
delving
into
the
record.
mr.
stephen
d.
neely
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
question
even
more
precisely,
if
i
may
is
whether
or
not
from
the
record
in
this
case,
entire
record
in
this
case
manifest
necessity
is
apparent.
it
is
my
contention
that
it
is
apparent
from
the
entire
record
in
this
case
and
i
believe
that
narrows
your
honor's
position
somewhat.
mr.
stephen
d.
neely
i
think,
your
honor
that
very
probably
that
question
be
going
the
way
depending
upon
the
facts,
but
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
the
question
of
what
the
judge
said
is
far
less
important
than
the
question
what
the
judge
did
and
what
the
circumstance
dictated.
now,
this
court
has
indicated
many
times
in
the
past
its
reluctance
to
characterize.
mr.
stephen
d.
neely
i
think
it
is
very
probable.
under
that
circumstance
an
appellate
court
would
be
justified
in
saying
that
there
has
not
been
an
adequate
consideration,
he
has
failed
completely.
mr.
stephen
d.
neely
had
there
been
any
real
misconduct
in
the
joint
case
i
think
it
is
really
possible
that
the
premise
that
you
stated
could
have
applied
there.
mr.
stephen
d.
neely
i
do
not
believe
that
obligation
extends
or
the
extension
of
that
obligation
is
any
great
factor.
it
is
always
been
my
understanding
and
i
believe
that
the
law
is
clear,
that
the
state
court
is
permitted
and
in
fact
perhaps
required
to
go
into
the
facts
and
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
allegation
of
what
was
incorrect
in
the
original
proceedings
which
would
justify
the
granting
of
the
writ.
mr.
stephen
d.
neely
i
am
sorry
federal
court.
the
question
i
think
that
first
i
would
ask
this
court
to
resolve
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
findings
themselves
are
necessarily
controlling
on
the
determination
that
is
made
by
the
federal
courts
in
revealing
that
the
question
of
whether
habeas
corpus
should
be
granted
in
situations,
where
a
mistrial
has
been
granted
without
the
defendant's
consent.
i
think
the
second
question
would
be
that
even
if
the
court
finds
that
that
is
not
the
case
there
is
still
this
remaining
question
and
that
is
where
the
standard
that
was
applied
by
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
this
matter
on
review
the
district
court
judgment
was
the
correct
standard.
i
think
the
standard
that
is
implied
at
least
by
the
court's
past
decisions
with
respective
to
cases
and
situations
wherein
the
mistrial
is
based
upon
a
finding
of
misconduct
or
improper
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
defense
attorney
is
somewhat
different
than
the
standard
that
here
was
applied
by
the
court
in
the
ninth
circuit.
the
standard
clearly
there
was
the
joint
standard.
i
think
the
standard
should
been
have
been
some
those
standards.
i
think
that
if
we
are
lining
up
the
question
of
manifest
necessity
and
the
question
of
whether
the
ends
of
justice
will
be
defeated
by
the
continuing
of
the
proceeding,
that
one
of
the
things
that
should
be
considered
in
terms
of
the
end
of
justice
and
that
is
the
fact
that
the
state
also
has
a
right
to
present
its
material,
its
case
to
an
impartial
and
fairer
jury.
i
think
a
situation,
for
example
in
this
case,
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
arizona
was
improperly
called
as
an
unsworn
witness,
essentially
to
bolster
the
position
of
defense
counsel
and
the
defense
that
they
clearly
are
several
implications
on
a
jury
that
can
best
be
perceived
by
the
trial
court
that
could
very
well
result
and
in
fact
probably
would
result
in
the
trial
court's
attitude
being
prejudiced
against
the
state
and
against
giving
the
state
a
fair
hearing
on
its
trial
of
the
case.
i
think
the
additional
reference
is
to
a
long
time
that
mr.
washington
has
spent
in
prison,
the
reference
is
to
the
prosecutor
been
removed
from
the
case.
i
think
all
of
those
references
taken
in
conjunction
with
the
again
attempt
to
call
upon
the
supreme
court
as
unsworn
witnesses
to
bolster
the
defense
position
could
very
well
had
been
found
by
the
trial
judge
under
the
circumstances
to
have
compelled
the
granting
of
a
mistrial
in
this
case
and
could
almost
not
have
been
found
to
meet
the
standard
of
the
question
whether
the
ends
of
justice
necessitated
in
this
trial.
i
think
it
is
clear
that
the
possibility
of
the
prejudices
was
so
strong
here
that
it
clearly
justified
the
finding
of
trial
court.
i
like
to
reserve
some
time
if
i
may.
mr.
stephen
d.
neely
just
a
moment
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
one
thing
i
do
want
to
make
clear
particularly
reflected
by
a
question
by
mr
justice
rehnquist.
i
did
not
take
the
position
that
judge
walsh
would
necessarily
have
stated
or
found
that
the
record
supported
the
finding
of
the
mistrial.
the
position
i
take
was
that
judge
walsh
indicated
that
he
had
read
and
reread
the
record
and
that
had
there
been
a
specific
finding
that
would
have
basically
settled
it
for
him.
the
implication
that
i
read
from
that
is
that
we
do
not
really
know
whether
or
not
he
agreed
with
the
trial
judge's
finding,
but
that
the
basis
for
his
granting
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
was
purely
and
simply
that
the
trial
judge
did
not
say
i
find
a
manifest
necessity.
i
think
that
is
clear
from
the
arguments
of
the
counsel
and
the
answers
to
the
question
that
this
case
is
one
that
turns
on
the
facts,
but
again
i
would
suggest
that
the
position
taken
by
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
this
matter
is
essentially
that
in
ordinary
circumstances
questions
are
raised,
arguments
are
heard
and
findings
are
made
and
that
the
only
thing
that
is
missing
in
this
case
is
the
findings
and
i
think
that
their
position
clearly
is,
that
if
those
findings
had
been
there,
it
would
have
been
a
different
story
because
they
talk
about
reluctantly
dismissing
and
i
think
it
is
also
clear
that
the
basic
approach
they
used
here
was
to
say
we
decline
to
imply
from
the
impropriety
committed
by
defense
counsel
that
this
court
made
a
specific
finding
of
manifest
necessity.
i
do
not
believe
that
that
is
a
fair
standard
to
apply
against
trial
judges.
i
believe
that
there
has
to
be,
when
you
have
set
out
your
standard
as
being
an
abuse
of
discretion
on
the
part
of
trial
judge
that
there
has
to
be
an
addition
to
the
scrupulous
exercise
of
discretion
by
the
trial
judge,
a
scrupulous
exercise
of
the
appellate
court's
review
of
the
record.
in
essence,
i
think
that
the
appellate
court
has
to
go
back
to
the
record
and
has
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
trial
judge's
position
was
or
was
not
abuse
of
discretion.
surely,
if
i
came
up
here
as
a
defendant
and
said
that
there
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
you
would
not
hear
me.
on
the
other
hand
to
say
as
a
prosecutor,
well,
there
may
have
been,
but
there
is
findings
here
that
specifically
state
that
there
was
manifest
necessity
and
all
the
alternatives
were
considered
and
that
is
final
on
the
issue.
thank
you
very
much.
