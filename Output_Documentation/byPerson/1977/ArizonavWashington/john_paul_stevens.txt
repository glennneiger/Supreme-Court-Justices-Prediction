justice
john
paul
stevens
george
washington
jr.
was
indicted
for
the
murder
of
a
hotel
clerk
in
tucson,
arizona.
during
opening
statements
to
the
jury,
defense
counsel
made
certain
prejudicial
comments
about
the
prosecution.
the
state,
therefore,
moved
for
a
mistrial.
after
some
evidence
had
been
heard
and
after
hearing
extended
argument,
the
arizona
trial
judge
granted
the
mistrial.
he
did
not,
however,
expressly
find
that
there
was
manifest
necessity
for
the
ruling.
his
action
gave
rise
to
the
question
whether
a
second
trial
would
be
barred
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
federal
constitution.
in
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding,
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
arizona,
concluded
that
since
the
trial
judge
had
not
canvased
on
the
record,
the
possibility
that
other
alternatives
such
as
careful
instructions
to
the
jury
would
minimize
the
risk
of
jury
bias
and
since
the
trial
judge
had
not
expressly
found
that
there
was
manifest
necessity
for
a
mistrial,
the
double
jeopardy
clause
barred
further
prosecution.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed.
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit.
as
we
explained
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
a
state
trial
judge
has
broad
discretion
in
evaluating
the
significance
of
possible
jury
prejudice.
the
reasons
for
the
exercise
of
the
trial
judge's
discretion
in
this
case
are
adequately
disclosed
by
the
record.
we
are
unwilling
to
attach
constitutional
significance
to
his
failure
to
make
the
expressed
finding
of
manifest
necessity
that
would
have
made
the
reviewing
court's
task
easier
to
perform.
accordingly
the
trial
in
the
arizona
courts
will
be
permitted
to
proceed.
mr.
justice
blackmun
concurs
in
the
result.
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
mr.
justice
brennan
has
joined.
