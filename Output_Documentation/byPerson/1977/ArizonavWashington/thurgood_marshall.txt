marshall
which
opinion
is
controlling?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
had
one
opinion
with
two
judges
and
one
opinion
with
one
judge
and
that
had
trouble?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
both
of
them
were
against
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
still
do
not
know,
which
one
is
here?
because
two
judge
went
one
way
in
the
concurrent
opinion
and
one
judge
wrote
for
all
three
of
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
point
is
that
judge
did
not
evolve
three?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
defense
counsel
had
any
problem
there
at
on?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
both
sides?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
so
again
it
is
one
man
to
man.
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
two
jurors
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
none
of
that
is
in
any
of
these
opinions?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
is
not
in
his
opinion?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
not
in
the
court,
in
either
one
of
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
why
are
you
arguing
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
we
can
get
in
that
proof?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
have
the
memorandum?
justice
thurgood
marshall
throught
the
opinion.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
say
is
that
you
think
that
we
took
this
case
to
pass
on
local
rule
314
of
the
state
of
arizona?
