chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
1168,
arizona
against
george
washington.
mr.
neely
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
rule
of
court
that
you
referred
to,
is
that
still
a
rule
of
court
that
is
still
in
effect?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
rule
of
court
referred
to
as
having
them
mentioning
about
the
prosecution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
statement
you
just
made
was,
that's
what
i
am
addressing
my
question
to,
the
rule
referred
to
a
rule
which
was
at
that
time
still
in
effect?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
neely.
mr.
bolding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
they
were
--
the
jurors
would
sooner
or
later
find
if
the
transcripts
were
there
that
a
prior
trial
had
been
held,
would
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
any
question
about
it
at
all?
if
you
bring
in
a
transcript
of
a
prior
trial
with
the
jurors
listen
to
that
case,
they
are
going
to
know
that
there
was
a
prior
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
seem
to
be
using
matters
as
justification
for
the
conduct
of
the
defense
counsel
would
follow?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
turn
one
of
the
things
said,
after
the
warning
by
the
trial
judge
to
desist,
the
statement
was
made
you
will
hear
evidence
that
will
show
you
that
there
was
another
eye
witness,
then
you
will
hear
evidence
that,
that
evidence
was
suppressed
and
hidden
by
the
prosecutor,
you
will
hear
that
the
evidence
was
purposely
withheld
and
so
forth
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
was
the
jury
going
to
hear
about
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
state
paid
its
penalty
for
that
by
having
a
new
trial
ordered?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
in
what
way
would
this
evidence,
these
items
that
i
just
read
that
you
will
hear,
how
would
that
be
relevant
evidence
admissible?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
are
representing
now
to
this
court
that
under
arizona
law
that
kind
of
evidence
would
have
been
received
so
that
the
statements
made
by
the
defense
counsel
were
correct
statements,
all
of
them
were
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
supreme
court
did
not
think
this
was
the
same,
did
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
did
we
grant
review,
to
review
these
matters
you
are
talking
about
now
or
they
--
were
they
not
washed
out
on
a
new
trial
was
granted?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
thought
what
we
were
reviewing
here
was
whether
the
misconduct
of
the
defense
was
so
gross
that
it
warranted
a
declaration
of
a
mistrial
and
that
is
the
question
before
us
and
whether
it
was
appropriately
analyzed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
you
wish
to
use
your
limited
time
arguing
that
go
ahead.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
the
judge
had
said
under
the
motion
for
a
mistrial
that
i
am
granting
the
mistrial
because
grossly,
unprofessional
conduct
of
the
defense
counsel
which
has
tainted
the
minds
of
all
the
jurors
to
the
point
where
there
cannot
be
a
fair
trial.
do
you
think
that
would
be
equated
by
a
reviewing
court
to
a
finding
of
manifest
necessity?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
why
do
you
think
he
granted
a
mistrial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
even
if
rule
314
had
never
existed
on
the
books
or
had
become
obsolete
and
had
been
eliminated
and
you
had
no
rule,
does
not
the
law
of
arizona
permit
a
judge
to
use
sound
judicial
discretion
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
has
been
taint
that
would
impair
a
fair
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
why
is
the
rule
important
one
way
or
the
other?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further
counsel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgments
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
76-1168,
arizona
and
others
against
washington
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
stevens.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
stevens.
