is
that
true
if
there
was
some
reason
in
the
record
to
think
that
judge
applied
the
wrong
legal
standing?
justice

well
if
the
judge
indicated
that
he
did
not
think
that
finding
a
manifest
necessity
was
necessary
at
all
in
this
case
as
he
has
read
the
cases
and
that
all
he
had
to
do
is
to
find
some
possible
prejudice?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
he
might
canvas
a
record
and
find
that
there
was
a
manifest
necessity?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
that
even
though
it
was
the
defense
that
made
the
first
motion
for
a
mistrial?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
with
all
this
wrangling
and
counter
wrangling,
could
not
the
judge
have
determined
that
a
fair
trial
just
could
not
be
had
and
does
not
that
equate
with
the
finding
of
manifest
necessity?
