justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
judge
truman,
the
trial
judge
in
both
cases,
both
the
first
trial
and
the
second
trial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
two
different
trial
judge.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
that
court
you
view
as
it
has
interchanged,
you
used
joe
for
judge
walsh
and
the
other
time
you
are
referring
to
the
superior
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to
what
extent
is
habeas
accorded
if
any
obligated
to
give
difference
to
a
state
trial
court's
findings
and
its
implied
finding
on
the
subject
such
as
this?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
state
court,
you
mean
federal
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
the
trial
judge
certainly
did
not
agree
with
your
reasoning
of
arizona
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
bolding,
let
me,
you
are
free
to
go
back
the
evidence,
i
would
like
to
ask
you
a
question
first.
as
you
may
imagine
there
are
presumably
hundreds
of
double
jeopardy
rulings
by
various
courts
throughout
the
country
in
any
given
year
and
we
do
not
try
to
review
all
of
them
on
their
facts,
on
their
facts.
if
the
trial
judge
in
this
case
on
precisely
the
record
that
there
is
here
had
made
a
finding
that
the
jury,
there
was
a
probability
of
jury
taint
and
the,
and
the
prosecution
could
not
get
a
fair
trial
as
a
result
of
the
defendant's
examination,
and
therefore,
it
was
manifestly
necessary
citing
us
v.
perez
to
grant
a
mistrial
and
then
panel
a
new
jury.
do
you
think
you
would
still
be
entitled
to
habeas
corpus?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
he
was
express
in
saying
that
he
thought
the
record
would
have
supported
a
finding
by
the
superior
court
judge
of
manifest
necessity,
but
ruled
that
since
there
had
not
been
an
express
finding,
he
was
going
to
grant
habeas?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
the
conclusion
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
that
it
was
just
as
likely
that
the
superior
court
judge
had
granted
a
motion
for
a
mistrial
without
finding
manifest
necessity
then
it
was.
it
would
necessarily
follow
then
that
the
superior
court
judge
would
have
dismissed
or
had
granted
a
mistrial
of
the
prosecution's
case
for
what
it
conceived
to
be
misconduct
of
the
defense
counsel
in
a
situation
which
would
not
have
permitted
re-trail.
now,
that
is
just
an
absurdity?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
that
the
ninth
circuit
says
the
superior
court
judge
may
not
have
found
manifest
necessity
or
might
not
have
though
there
was
manifest
necessity.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
that
were
the
case,
the
superior
court
judge
would
have
granted
the
prosecutor's
motion
for
a
mistrial
based
on
defense
conducts
claimed
a
misconduct
in
such
circumstances
that
the
case
could
never
have
been
brought
again.
that
just
does
not
make
any
sense
in
a
rational
system
of
jurisprudence?
