mr.
james
e.
kulp
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
on
behalf
of
commonwealth
virginia
i
would
like
to
tell
this
court
that
the
questions
and
issues
in
this
court
are
easy
or
ones
which
the
commonwealth
had
not
wrestled
with.
but,
i
would
say
that
the
circumstances
and
the
facts
of
this
case
come
to
this
court
are
the
quite
different
circumstances
than
other
case
which
had
been
ruled
upon
from
this
court.
i
speak
for
example
cases
where,
such
as
oklahoma
publishing
company
and
cox
broadcasting
company
where
this
court
has
said
--
and
we
did
not
make
any
contention
otherwise
--
that
once
information
is
placed
in
the
public
domain,
there
is
absolutely
no
prohibition
for
being
made
public
or
being
published
in
the
newspapers.
also,
additionally
in
those
cases
where
the
court
has,
in
bridges
versus
california;
in
pennekamp
versus
florida;
in
craig
versus
harney;
in
wood
versus
georgia,
where
there
were
statements
or
criticisms
printed
about
the
judges
in
the
newspapers.
we
again
say
that
the
factual
situation
of
this
case
is
greatly
different
from
that.
on
the
basis
that
the
information
which
was
published
in
those
articles
occurred
in
the
public
domain
and
this
court
said
specifically
that
there
were
no
legislative
prior
enactment
which
would
give
this
court
any
guidance
as
to
the
legislative
intent.
now
we
submit
to
the
court
that
in
this
case,
we
have
not
only
a
legislative
intent
but
we
have
the
intent
manifested
by
the
both
of
the
people
or
commonwealth
of
virginia.
i
would
like
to
go
just
into
a
little
bit
of
history
as
to
the
reasons
for
the
enactment
of
this
particular
statute
on
consideration
today.
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
constitution
in
1971,
virginia
had
the
ways
of
removal
of
a
unfit
of
a
judge
or
one
who
was
guilt
of
misconduct,
the
provisions
of
impeachment,
there
was
also
the
situation
in
virginia
in
that
judges
are
elected
by
the
legislature
for
different
periods
of
time
depending
on
whether
they
are
justices
of
state
supreme
court
and
on
down
(ph).
so
at
each
time
when
the
legislature
would
meet
to
consider
the
reappointment
of
the
judge,
of
course,
that
presented
an
opportunity
for
information
to
be
given
as
to
his
character,
his
fitness
or
his
position.
for
over
200
years
in
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
there
is
not
a
single
reported
case
wherein
a
judge
was
removed
from
office
by
impeachment.
the
citizens
of
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
recognized
that
there
must
be
some
better
way
in
order
to
effectively
and
efficiently
deal
with
errant
judges,
judges
who
are
becoming
senile
or
other
physical
incapacities.
virginia
has
been
looked
what
other
states
were
doing.
california,
i
think
is
a
leading
state
in
this
area
where
they
enacted
legislations
setting
up
a
judicial
inquiry
and
review
commission.
one
of
the
cornerstones
in
the
hallmark
of
that
legislation
was
decided
to
be
by
judge
neely
of
california
who
was
a
former
chairman
of
the
california
commission
is
that
the
confidentiality
of
this
proceedings
is
a
necessary
component
in
order
to
effectively
administer
the
system.
forty
states
including
commonwealth
virginia,
and
two
puerto
rico
and
the
district
of
columbia
all
have
made
provisions
either
by
constitutional
mandate
or
by
statutory
mandate
to
set
up
a
review
commission
of
the
nature
and
type
of
the
commonwealth
virginia.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
to
answer
your
question
first,
each
of
the
42
require
confidentiality.
the
only
other
stature
that
compares
exactly
i
think
or
would
say
comparatively
with
virginia
is
hawaii.
hawaii
makes
a
felony
to
make
disclosure
of
confidential
information.
there
are
three
other
states
--
mr.
james
e.
kulp
well,
i
have
to
say
i
think
it
is
both
but
we
really
do
not
have
a
cage
which
has
construed
that.
the
only
case
i
have
pointed
out
in
my
brief
is
pending
presently
in
the
supreme
court
of
hawaii
and
in
that
case
it
actually
was
a
disclosure
by
a
complainant
which
is
a
little
bit
different
from
the
case
we
have
today.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
mr.
chief
justice
i
believe
that
the
question,
some
or
that
was
answered
by
the
state
of
california
in
mccarthy
versus
the
commission.
in
that
case
the
judge
under
investigation
made
a
request
that
the
commission
opened
up
the
hearing
to
the
public.
and
i
assume
for
the
same
very
reasons
that
your
honor
is
suggesting
that
he
thought
that
he
would
be
vindicated.
but
the
supreme
court
of
california
found
that
while
it
might
be
argued
that
the
confidentiality
has
one
of
its
main
purposes
to
protect
the
judge
from
unfounded
allegations
and
that
if
he
so
desired
that
he
could
himself
play
that
privilege.
they
found
nonetheless
that
that
was
not
the
only
reason.
they
gave
other
reasons
for
the
protection
of
witnesses
and
complainants.
and
that
was
the
reason
in
addition
to
the
protection
of
judges
that
they
therefore
held
that
the
commission
had
not
violated
any
constitutional
provision
by
not
allowing
the
hearing
to
be
over.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
if
it
please
the
court
mr.
chief
justice
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
question
about
that.
history
and
experience
has
so
shown
all
of
the
legal
items,
every
court
that
has
decided
the
case,
every
state
that
has
taken
a
look
at
it
has
come
up
with
the
same
exact
conclusion.
that
was
a
recent
study
of
attorneys,
for
example,
and
they
said
without
the
equivocation
that
they
would
not
make
complaints
against
sitting
judges
if
they
had
any
question
that
their
names
would
be
divulged
as
the
original
complainant.
i
think
it
goes
without
saying
that
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
a
judge
who
is
sitting
in
the
same
circuit
with
another
judge
to
make
a
complaint
and
that
his
name
be
brought
into
the
matter.
under
the
provisions
of
the
virginia
stature
the
original
complainant’s
name
is
never
divulged
even
in
those
situations
where
the
case
goes
to
the
supreme
court
of
virginia,
because
the
commission
never
makes
the
name
complainant
a
matter
of
public
record.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
well,
i
think
mr.
justice
marshall
that
what
they
are
asking
for
is
confidentiality,.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
no
sir,
well,
i
think
it
is
to
a
great
extent,
because
the
fact
is
--
mr.
james
e.
kulp
that
is
right
sir.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
we
have
it,
if
it
please
--
mr.
james
e.
kulp
well,
we
do
not
think
so.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
no
sir,
i
think
that
it
is
a
necessary
measure
i
think
that
it
is
found
by
the
supreme
court.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
no
sir,
the
state
of
hawaii
had,
yes
sir.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
and
there
are
three
of
them
--
mr.
james
e.
kulp
i
never
said
that
except
for
the
fact
that
they
feel
that
the
foundation
for
the
commission
itself
must
be
in
rest
around
confidentiality.
it
appears
to
me
mr.
justice
marshall
that
if
the
citizens
and
the
citizens
around
the
country,
and
i
would
submit
that
the
federal
government
even
today
is
considering
that
somewhat
type
statute
and
in
that
they
are
making
it
requirement
of
confidentiality.
i
submit
that
it
just
simple
does
not
follow,
if
we
say
that
the
very
essence
--
mr.
james
e.
kulp
no
sir
i
think
that
--
mr.
james
e.
kulp
no
sir,
but
i
think
we
have
--
mr.
james
e.
kulp
i
do
not
think
it
is
just
the
judge,
that
is
not
what
the
supreme
court
virginia
said.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
i
think
only
--
their
allegations
made
only
against
judges,
i
think
with
that
--
mr.
james
e.
kulp
i
think
that
because
of
the
fact
that
i
think
you
have
a
different
between
the
administration
of
justice
which
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
found
as
the
reason
on
the
one
hand.
on
the
other
hand
where
you
have
legislative
and
executive
situations,
particularly
in
virginia
they
are
purely
political.
they
are
used
to
the
rough
and
tumble.
they
have
ways
to
defend
themselves
but
if
we
say
that
the
confidentiality
in
this
case
as
several
of
the
justices
have
indicated
that
if
it
were
limited
to
witnesses
then
you
see
the
newspapers
when
they
print
the
information
first
of
all
will
not
give
us
the
information
as
to
who
broke
their
oath
to
secrecy
and
who
breeched
the
confidentiality.
we
ask
them
for
the
information
and
they
have
refused
to
give
it
to
us.
so
we
have
no
viable
protection.
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
whole
history
shows
that
in
this
case
--
i
agree
with
mr.
abrams
as
far
as
the
landmark
case
is
concerned
which
is
a
case
before
this
court
that
there
has
not
been
any
printing
in
the
article
here
giving
the
name
of
any
complainant
nor
giving
the
name
of
any
witness,
but
i
do
contest
their
contention
in
the
brief
that
that
has
been
the
theme
of
publication
in
virginia
because
it
simply
has
not.
as
i
indicated
in
the
appendix
to
the
commonwealth’s
brief
on
page
41,
the
richmond
newspaper
printed
not
only
the
name
that
the
judge
was
under
investigation
but
they
printed
names
of
the
witnesses
and
they
additionally
gave
the
name
of
the
attorney
who
was
the
original
complainant
and
his
law
firm.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
that
is
correct.
no
sir,
i
would
have
to
go
back
to
that
because
this
particular
article,
mr.
justice
marshall
dealt
with
judge
which
in
fact
did
go
to
the
spring
court
of
virginia,
have
the
name
of
a
complainant
would
not
be
released
even
in
the
public
papers,
the
names
of
the
witnesses
would.
and
as
i
have
indicated,
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
said
that
what
the
stature
attempts
to
do
is
to
protect
the
complainants
and
witnesses
until
such
time
as
the
commission
has
found
sufficient
background
and
sufficient
justification
to
bring
a
formal
complaint.
as
mr.
justice
stevens
was
mentioning
a
moment
ago.
we
know
for
example,
the
reports
are
from
california,
that
well
over
i
think
about
two
thirds
at
least
50%
of
two
thirds
somewhere
in
that
neighborhood
of
the
complaints
are
found
to
be
initially
frivolous.
now,
if
we
did
not
have
and
did
not
provide
for
confidentiality,
the
names
of
these
people
who
made
these
complaints
in
good
faith,
the
names
of
any
people
who
may
have
been
called
upon
to
give
testimony
in
the
preliminary
stages,
all
of
their
names
would
be
subject
to
being
released.
we
submit
to
the
court
that
that
is
what
we
are
tempting
to,
and
the
people
of
virginia
are
attempting
to
avoid.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
question
about
that
mr.
justice
stevens.
that
has
been
certainly
the
practice
in
california
particularly.
they
make
the
report
and
they
have
shown
that
prior
to
the
attempt
they
have
never
had
any
formal
hearings.
that
once
the
commission
--
and
i
want
to
make
that
clear
--
it
is
the
commission
that
makes
a
complaint
against
the
judge,
the
initial
complainant
simply
files
his
papers
with
the
commission.
the
commission
at
that
point
then
makes
its
investigation.
if
they
find
that
the
complaint
is
justified
or
at
least
has
merit
then
they
are
the
ones
that
been
the
contacting
of
the
judge
and
so
they
take
it
over
at
that
point.
so,
i
would
say
to
the
court
also
in
this
case
while
virginia
does
not
normally
publish
the
results
as
they
do
in
california
about
how
many
complaints
have
been
filed
and
how
many
judges
may
have
resigned
prior
to
the
time
coming
to
the
supreme
court
of
virginia.
in
the
report
which
is
the
subject
of
this
particular
case
the
report
filed
by
landmark,
the
publication
they
do
have
from
mr.
bakeman
who
was
one
of
the
members
--
it
is
page
47-a
of
the
appendix
shows
the
original
new
article,
and
it
does
show
that
mr.
bakeman
did
indicate.
it
says
when
asked
via
one
case
that
had
ever
been
referred
to
supree
court,
bakeman
said,
mr.
bakeman
being
a
member
of
the
commission
“several
judges
did
resign
a
number
have
retired
or
something
like
that.”
so
we
know
that
even
in
virginia
on
that
information
that
the
commission
has
had
its
impact.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
indeed
is
mr.
chief
justice.
in
other
words
the
studies
which
have
been
made
indicate
that
the
complainants
will
not
come
forward
if
you
do
not
ensure
them
of
confidentiality.
so,
or
course,
that
is
one
of
the
whole
essence
of
the
confidentiality
provisions
itself
is
to
encourage
the
complaints.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
we
do
have
that
but
of
course
that
is
at
his
discretion.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
the
discretion
of
the
judge,
yes
sir,
and
of
course
i
assume
we
could
if
he
refuses
to
recuse
himself
that
you
could
file
a
petition
for
mandamus
but
of
course
there
you
are
faced
with
a
situation
of
whether
it
has
been
arbitrary
and
capricious
action
on
his
part.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
i
am
sorry
mr.
justice
marshall
i
am
not
sure.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
i
would
say
that
is
their
position,
yes
sir.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
i
could
not
agree
with
that
sir
because
i
think
it
has
to
be
all
taken
together.
if
it
worked
for
the
violation
of
the
constitution
--
of
the
confidentiality
then
there
would
have
been
the
criminal
prosecution
in
the
first
place.
i
would
also
like
to
say
to
the
court
that
i
think
that
as
i
indicated
the
circumstances
in
this
case
are
entirely
different
from
any
case
that
i
am
aware
of
that
has
ever
been
to
this
court
before.
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
in
its
opinion
indicated
that
they
had
not
found
any
case
somewhat
to
the
one
here,
i
have
not
found
any
in
my
research,
the
landmark
has
not
cited
any
to
the
court,
so
i
am
assuming
fairly
honestly
that
there
is
no
such
case.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
that
is
correct
sir,
i
think
that
that
is
one
thing,
and
i
think
also
that
in
the
new
york
times
case
several
of
the
justice
on
this
court
indicated
first
of
all
that
there
was
no
guidance
from
congress
as
to
whether
there
should
be
any
restraint
on
the
publication
of
those
particular
materials,
and
it
was
the
congress
to
set
--
mr.
james
e.
kulp
i
think
though
if
i
am
thinking
of
the
same
case
if
it
was
allsburg,
i
think
it
was
aborted
not
though
because
of
anything,
any
failure
in
the
law,
but
because
of
--
mr.
james
e.
kulp
yes
sir,
but
i
think
that
the
point
that
i
am
trying
to
make
is
that
the
court
found
that
there
was
no
law
which
sanction
the
prior
restraint,
and
that
was
the
issue
as
i
read
the
new
york
times
case
that
was
before
the
court.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
that
is
why
we
say
that
this
is
an
entirely
different
matter
and
when
you
look
at
it
in
that
context,
we
think
that
you
get
a
different
result.
we
do
not
disagree
as
we
have
taken
position
in
brief
with
the
new
york
times
case,
the
prior
restraint
case,
in
that
it
is
conceded
by
landmark
in
this
case,
that
is
not
the
case
here.
it
is
not
a
prior
restraint.
we
are
talking
about
subsequent
punishment.
and
i
think
the
law
in
regards
to
that
is
different,
because
while
the
presumption
of
the
validity
of
a
statute
the
prior
restraint
is
very
hard
to
overcome
as
this
court
in
its
prior
opinion
certainly
indicated.
it
is
almost
a
situation
where
you
cannot
overcome
it,
but
the
court
has
not
said
that
when
you
are
talking
in
situations
of
subsequent
punishment.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
yes
sir.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
yes
sir.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
no
sir
i
do
not
think
that
is
what
the
supreme
court
of
virginia,
as
well
as
the
stature
has
indicated
that
it
is
merely
drawn
--
mr.
james
e.
kulp
no
sir,
i
think
that
the
cases
from
this
court
are
too
clear
in
that
respect
that
in
other
words
a
judge
as
any
of
public
official
may
certainly
be
criticized,
the
administration
of
justice
may
be
criticized,
and
we
do
not
have
any
argument
about
that.
all
we
are
saying
is
that,
and
as
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
found
in
its
opinion,
it
says,
considering
this
matters
we
believe
it
can
be
set
safely
without
need
apart
in
court
evidence
that
absent
a
requirement
of
confidentiality
the
judicial
inquiry
and
review
commission
could
not
function
properly
or
discharge
effectively
his
intended
purpose.
the
sanctions
are
indispensable
to
the
suppression
of
the
clear
and
present
danger
posed
by
the
premature
disclosure
by
the
commission’s
sensitive
proceedings.
the
imminent
impairment
of
the
effectiveness
of
the
commission
in
the
companying
immediate
throughout
to
the
orderly
administration
of
justice.
so
it
only
has
an
incidental
matter
i
think
that
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
supreme
court
gave
was
to
protect
the
judge.
i
do
not
think
that
that
--
mr.
james
e.
kulp
or
the
insults
against
the
judicial
system
in
general.
i
do
not
think
that
is
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
we
do
not
now
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
there
used
to
be.
there
was
reorganization
several
years
ago
in
order
to
have
more
than
one
judge
in
every
circuit.
so,
that
you
would
not
have
to
be
appointing
someone
if
the
judge
for
some
reason
could
not
--
mr.
james
e.
kulp
no
sir,
the
statute
would
not
prohibit
that.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
i
believe
that
part
of
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
statute.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
well,
i
think
if
the
--
perhaps
not
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
think
that
if
he
did
carry
forth
and
make
the
filing,
then
i
would
have
to
assume
that
the
it
probably
would
come
under
the
provisions
of
the
statute,
because
it
would
be
telling
the
press
in
advance
that
i
am
going
to
file
it
tomorrow,
and
that
would
be
disclosing
the
information
which
is
not
confidential
at
that
moment,
but
would
take
on
confidentiality
at
the
time.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
yes
sir.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
yes
sir,
and
we
do
not
assert
--
the
statute
does
not
--
mr.
james
e.
kulp
prohibit
that.
now
i
would
like
to
make
one
of
the
--
mr.
james
e.
kulp
yes
sir,
i
would
have
to
say
that
that
is
true,
because
the
statute
provides
that
all
confidential
materials
of
the
commission
must
be
files
in
the
confidential
files.
but,
i
would
say
this
mr.
justice
stevens
is
that
there
is
provision
in
the
statute.
and,
i
think
this
answers
some
of
the
criticism
of
the
statute
by
saying,
suppose
that
we
had
a
corrupt
commission
which
i
find
to
be
an
extreme
state
of
affairs
to
say
that
this
commission
all
would
be
corrupt,
but,
assuming
that
there
were
for
a
moment,
it
does
provide
that
members
of
the
legislature
may
request
and
the
commission
may
release
the
information
to
the
legislature
when
the
reappointment
of
a
judge
is
to
be
reconsidered
by
the
legislature.
and
we
take
a
position
that
if
the
legislature
does
in
fact
ask
for
the
information
and
releases
it,
then
it
becomes
in
the
public
domain
and
it
would
not
fall
under
the
strictures
of
this
particular
section
for
the
same
reasons
that
i
believe
that
the
court
was
talking
about
in
cox
broadcasting
company.
in
other
words,
once
the
state
itself
releases
the
information
and
puts
it
into
the
public
domain,
then
there
is
no
right
to
suppress
it.
and,
we
would
not
contend
to
--
mr.
james
e.
kulp
yes
sir,
i
would
say
under
the
statute
that
would
be
true.
i
would
like
to
make
two
further
points
if
i
may.
one
is
that
we
think
that
the
commission
has
answered
the
problem
which
virginia
citizens
have
foreseen.
as
i
have
indicated
previously
for
the
200
years
where
impeachment
and
others
types
of
removals
were
available,
there
was
not
a
single
removal
of
any
judge
for
any
mental
disability,
any
incompetence,
any
malfeasons
(ph)
in
office.
since
1971,
when
the
constitution
was
enacted
by
the
people
providing
for
the
commission,
and
since
the
commission
was
specifically
then
thereafter
set
up
by
legislation
in
1971,
the
commission
has
taken
action
which
had
been
reported
to
the
supreme
court
of
virginia,
which
has
been
reported
to
the
citizens
of
the
commonwealth,
which
has
been
reported
by
the
press,
one
judge
has
been
removed
from
office
and
three
other
judges
have
been
publicly
censored
for
activity
which
has
an
effect
on
the
administration
of
justice.
so
i
would
say
that
that
is
where
the
public
interest
lies.
the
public
interest
lies
in
being
able
to
effectively
handle
these
types
of
problems.
and
i
think
that
history
shows
across
the
country
that
this
is
precisely
why
the
states
have
gone
to
this
procedure.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
yes
sir,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
and
as
i
say,
we
are
in
sort
of
a
dilemma
here
in
certain
respects,
because
the
press
wants
to
print
the
confidential
information
then
on
the
other
hand
they
want
to
protect
the
confidentiality
of
their
source.
we
have
asked
them
for
the
information,
and
they
will
not
give
us
the
names.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
no
sir,
it
is
not,
but
as
i
say
i
think
that
it
all
evolves
around
the
same
ball
of
lack,
so
to
speak.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
no
sir,
i
would
not
say
you
that
is
unusual;
i
say,
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
brief,
i
think
it
is
a
very
untidy
way
for
us
to
be
trying
to
run
a
democratic
society
to
be
competing
one
with
another
on
information
of
that
nature.
i
would
also
like
to
make
one
further
comment
--
mr.
james
e.
kulp
no
sir.
i
would
have
to
concede
that
i
do
not
believe
they
do,
and
it
gets
--
i
do
not
recognize,
it
is
not
about
my
personal
views
might
be,
and
i
am
sure
they
are
not
consistent
with
mr.
abrams
and
others.
and,
i
recognize
a
responsibility
and
the
requirements
of
the
first
amendment.
but
i
think
also
that
even
as
members
of
this
court
indicated
that
there
is
a
line
of
responsibility.
and,
i
would
certainly
hoping
that
--
i
know
for
example
in
california,
judge
neely
said
that
they
have
had
the
understanding
of
the
press
out
there
and
they
do
not
print
this
information.
i
would
like
to
make
one
further
point
if
i
may,
in
its
active
way
in
which
this
information
is
obtained
--
now
the
record
in
this
case
and
what
was
found
by
the
supreme
court
if
virginia
does
not
show
exactly
how
the
press
first
got
the
information.
it
does
not
show
whether
they
went
into
private
commission
files,
or
some
other
way.
and,
i
do
not
really
indicate
and
i
do
not
really
think
that
the
press
did
that.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
no
sir,
but
i
think
though
that
--
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make
mr.
chief
justice
is
that
here
we
have
a
situation
in
the
article
itself
which
is
published
--
and
this
in
the
appendix
on
page
47-a
--
shows
that
once
they
get
this
initial
information
they
went
around
to
the
commission
members,
they
went
around
to
purported
witnesses,
they
went
around
to
the
judge
himself,
and
attempted
to
cajole
out
of
them
information
which
they
say
that
the
state
has,
at
least
i
take
it,
they
are
saying
the
state
has
a
right
to
keep
confidential.
i
see
the
position
of
the
newspaper,
they
are
saying,
well,
if
we
can
get
it.
that
is
one
thing.
it
is
a
right
for
you
to
try
to
keep
it
confidential,
but
if
we
can
get
it,
then
it
is
a
right
for
us
to
publish
it.
and
i
submit
that
that
just
applies
in
the
phase
of
what
we
think
of
as
a
civilized
society.
we
say
on
the
one
hand,
that
the
government
cannot
go
about
inducing
innocent
people
to
commit
crimes,
such
as
entrapment,
for
example,
but
again
in
this
case,
and
the
article
shows
in
fact
they
tried
to
do
it,
tried
to
get
honest
public
citizens
of
commonwealth
virginia
to
breach
their
confidentiality
and
witnesses
do
not
even
say
that
you
even
talk
to
me
because
i
am
not
to
tell
you
anything.
and
he
did
not
tell
them
anything,
but
apparently
some
did
not.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not
know
whether
it
is
or
not,
because
if
you
draw
a
distinction
and
say,
well,
if
they
did
not
get
it
in
a
unlawful
criminal
way
that
may
be
one
thing,
but
if
they
do
it
is
another
thing.
i
do
think
there
can
be
distinctions
drawn
in
it.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
well,
but
i
believe
mr.
chief
justice,
because
in
other
words
if
the
complainant
and
the
witnesses
and
those
people
who
are
involved
in
the
proceedings,
and
the
commission
rules
themselves
which
are
referred
to
and
they
printed
in
point
215
of
virginia
reports
say
specifically
that
they
advise
every
participant
of
the
confidential
nature
of
the
matter
and
that
it
is
a
crime
to
divulge
it.
and
all
i
am
saying
is
that
here
we
have
the
press
going
out,
attempting
to
get
otherwise
honest
citizens
to
breach
an
oath
to
breach
the
confidentiality.
and
i
submit
that
therefore
it
puts
it
in
a
different
context.
and,
i
would
close
by
saying
that
i
think
in
the
last
analysis
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
people
of
virginia,
in
passing
the
constitution
of
1971
and
their
elected
officials
by
enacting
the
statutes
in
question,
may
constitutionally
determine
that
certain
matters
of
public
interest
are
to
kept
confidential
or
is
that
decision
to
be
made
by
an
unelected
and
unnamed
editor
of
some
newspaper.
