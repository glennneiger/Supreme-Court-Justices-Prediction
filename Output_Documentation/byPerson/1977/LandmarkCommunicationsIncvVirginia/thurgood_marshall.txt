justice
thurgood
marshall
if
it
was
public
then
anybody
can
use
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
abrams
did
the
state
at
any
time
relied
on
the
clear
and
present
danger
doctrine?
justice
thurgood
marshall
rely
on
that
in
this
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
question
was
what
did
the
state
show
about
clear
and
present
danger?
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
have
it
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
about
--
how
do
we
have
it
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
kulp,
you
are
talking
about
confidentiality
or
criminal
prosecution
when
we
say
that
you
cannot
do
it
and
that
these
witnesses
insist
of,
what
do
they
insist
of,
confidentiality
or
the
prosecution
of
the
newspaper?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
this
raises
a
criminal
prosecution.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
is
a
little
different
from
confidentiality.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
a
little
step
forward,
isn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
backward
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
know
but,
mr.
kulp
my
only
point
is,
am
i
correct
that
virginia
is
the
only
state
that
has
this
criminal
provision
other
than
hawaii?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
the
only
two.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
any
broad
statements
you
make
about
the
other
48
states
is
just
not
true?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
there
any
confidentiality
when
you
are
investigating
a
member
of
the
general
assembly
in
virginia?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
there
any
confidentiality
in
any
other
branches
of
the
government
other
than
judges?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
is
a
judge
entitled
to
that
special
treatment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
who
else
is
covered
by
this?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
what
i
was
saying,
well,
why
is
that
particular
phase
of
government
deserving
of
this
special
protection?
i
am
not
saying
that
it
is
right
or
wrong,
there
must
be
a
reason
for
it,
shouldn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
would
never
be
released
under
normal
effects
of
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
kulp,
am
i
correct
that
the
other
side
does
not
object
to
the
confidentiality
of
it
at
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
am
i
not
correct
that
the
petitioner
does
not
object
to
the
confidentiality
of
the
law?
it
only
objects
to
being
prosecuted
for
publishing
what
they
have
found
out.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
the
confidentiality
is
out
of
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
just
a
little
point,
it
would
depend
on
him
to
file
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
he
did
not
file
it,
it
would
be
printable.
justice
thurgood
marshall
since
the
statute
is
concerned.
