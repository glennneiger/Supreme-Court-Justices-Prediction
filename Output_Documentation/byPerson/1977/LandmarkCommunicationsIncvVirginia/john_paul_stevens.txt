justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
abrams,
under
your
reading
of
the
virginia
supreme
court
opinion,
do
you
think
the
statute
would
apply
you
if
you
told
us
the
name
of
the
judge?
i
know
the
brief
is
very
careful
in
not
to
tell
us
who
it
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
statute
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
i
do
not
understand
the
argument
mr.
abrams,
because
if
no
charge
is
filed,
wouldn’t
the
need
for
protection
remain
for
the
same
period
of
time
that
the
statute
requires
confidentiality?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
judge
may
never
even
know
about
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
that
is
not
entirely
possible
that
if
there
were
total
confidentiality
the
judge
never
knew
about
but,
then
commission
decided
there
was
no
merit
to
a
charge
that
was
dismissed,
he
would
never
have
any
reason
to
retaliate
against
anyone.
whereas
if
the
name
of
the
judge
is
disclosed,
he
knows
there
has
been
an
investigation,
he
knows
there
is
one
likely
person
who
has
been
his
enemy
throughout
his
life
who
probably
said
something
to
commission,
there
is
then
created
a
danger
or
retaliation.
i
think
it
is
at
least
possible.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
would
you
say
about
this
case
if
there
was
an
argue
--
if
there
were
proof
that
this
judge
cannot
function
effectively
if
the
name
was
disclosed
right
on
either
for
trial
or
something.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
your
test?
i
am
puzzled
as
justice
rehnquist
is
by
your
saying
we
should
not
look
at
clear
and
present
danger.
i
take
it,
you
do
accept
the
possibility
that
there
might
be
a
national
security
type
fact
situation
which
might
justify
suppression
even
by
the
--
publication
by
the
press.
what
kind
of
limit
would
you
say
is
appropriate
for
that
sort
of
exemption
if
there
is
one?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
isn’t
it
also
true,
you
made
also
the
argument
that
that
sort
of
publication
might
implicate
interest
in
the
fair
trail
of
the
person
being
investigated
before
the
grand
jury.
so
you
might
have
an
independent
policy
reason
for
saying
that
should
be
confidential.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kulp,
isn’t
it
another
very
important
reason
for
confidentiality
that
you
want
to
be
able
to
persuade
the
judge
to
resign
before
the
matter
becomes
public?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kulp,
may
i
just
ask
one
of
the
questions
on
this
prior
restraint
presentation
of
the
statute.
did
i
correctly
understand
that
if
the
charge
is
filed,
and
then
it
is
not
--
no
formal
complaint
is
subsequently
filed,
so
you
never
released
the
confidential
character,
and
that
that
information
is
permanently
made
secret?
let
us
say
20
years
later
some
historian
stumbled
upon
this
information
and
were
then
to
divulge
it,
if
we
sustain
the
statute
he
then
be
guilty
of
the
crime.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
the
only
way
in
which
the
statute
permits
the
information
to
become
into
the
public
domain
is
through
this
legislative
request.
if
the
judge
did
not
run
for
re-election
and
resigned
or
whatever
might
have
happened,
he
would
be
permanently
protected
but
there
would
be
a
permanent
veil
of
secrecy
on
the
effected
characters
who
