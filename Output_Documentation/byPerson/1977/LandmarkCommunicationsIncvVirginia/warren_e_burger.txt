chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
here
arguments
next
in
landmark
communications
against
virginia.
mr.
abrams
i
think
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
characterized
in
this
charges
is
not
the
process
one
of
inquiry.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
charges
are
complaints
from
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
various
miscellaneous
sources
but
not
from
any
official
source
in
this
regard.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
a
criminal
charge.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
only
the
editor
of
the
paper
knows
that,
would
that
be
a
reasonable
assumption?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
perhaps
some
others,
but
those
two,
of
course,
must
know
about
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
would
the
statute
apply
differently,
would
it
apply
to
the
person
who
released
the
information?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
he
or
she
would
be
guilty
of
the
same
crime.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
giving
the
purpose
of
the
chairman
of
the
commission.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
a
member
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
virginia
or
the
commonwealth
of
virginia.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
of
course
you
need
not
as
justice
stewart
suggested,
but
if
the
judge
who
is
the
subject
of
the
inquiry,
called
a
press
conference
and
welcome
this
inquiry,
and
of
course
i
will
be
vindicated
swiftly
as
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
not
suggesting
the
first
amendment
protection
reaches
only
corporations
which
publish
newspapers
in
any
sense,
i
think.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it
is
pretty
old-fashioned
right
now,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
be
fair
to
say
that
they
have
indulged
in
a
presumption
that
that
was
the
reason
the
legislature
enacted
the
statute.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn’t
there
a
difference
in
that
grand
jury
is
concerned
exclusively
with
criminal
conduct
whereas
a
commission
of
this
kind
is
inquiring
into
fitness
of
duty,
is
that
an
important
difference?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
kulp.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
many
of
them
have
stature
comparable
to
virginia’s
on
the
disclosure
aspect?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
a
felony
on
the
disclosure
in
terms
of
the
internal
function
or
on
the
publisher
of
the
disclosed
material?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
would
you
think
if
the
judge
who
was
under
inquiry
out
at
press
conference
said
he
you
welcomed
the
inquiry
and
he
was
sure
it
would
be
vindicated
and
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
this
one
of
your
reasons
for
justification
of
this
stature
that
this
confidentiality
is
not
guaranteed
with
witnesses,
complainants
will
not
come
forward?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
not
sure
you
have
made
the
point
but
isn’t
one
of
your
strong
points
that
purpose
of
the
legislature
is
to
try
to
encourage
people
to
come
forward
and
to
give
evidence
against
unfit
judges
and
make
complaints
against
them,
and
that
the
protection
of
the
judge
is
something
of
parallel
consideration.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
provisions
do
you
have
in
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
for
the
disqualification
of
the
judge
in
the
motion
of
the
counsel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
discretion
of
the
judge
or
something.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
general
kulp
do
you
have
in
our
common
stake
the
commonwealth
of
virginia,
districts
where
there
is
only
one
judge?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
are
always
more
than
one.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
suppose
the
lawyer
is
referenced
to
whom
references
made
in
your
exhibit
at
page
41.
instead
going
to
the
commission
and
called
a
press
conference
in
sensibly
assembled
if
he
did
get
an
assembly
of
them,
all
of
the
things
that
he
said
to
the
commission.
now,
laying
aside
the
question
of
whether
he
would
be
opened
to
the
civil
claim
for
damages
and
somewhere
could
there
be
any
actions
against
the
press
for
publishing
that,
such
information?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
if
he
then
said
at
the
end
of
his
press
conference,
“tomorrow
i
will
file
all
of
these
statements
that
i
have
made
to
you
with
the
commission
and
here
is
a
copy
of
what
i
am
going
to
give
to
the
commission.”
(inaudible)
to
all
of
this?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
it
is
done
before
in
advance
to
the
filing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it
does
not
make
any
difference,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but,
even
if
you
can
show
that
some
of
these
press
reporters
paying
$50
or
$100
to
a
clerk
in
the
commission’s
office
to
get
it,
it
would
not
have
any
bearing
on
the
issue
now
before
this
court,
would
it?
that
is
another
problem,
a
separate
distinction,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
your
case,
in
any
means
of
getting
it
is
unlawful
because,
using
it
is
may
become
an
act

virginia,
by
the
commonwealth
of
virginia.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
landmark
communications
inc.
against
the
state
of
virginia
and
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
filed,
an
opinion
of
the
court
filed
with
the
clerk
this
morning,
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
to
that
court
for
further
proceedings,
not
inconsistent
with
our
opinion.
mr.
justice
stewart
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment,
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
powell
took
no
part
in
either
the
consideration
or
the
decision
of
the
case.
