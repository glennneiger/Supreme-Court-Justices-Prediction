mr.
floyd
abrams
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
criminal
convection
of
the
publisher
of
a
newspaper.
the
crime
for
which
it
has
been
convicted
and
fined
is
the
publication
by
the
newspaper
of
a
name
of
a
judge,
a
judge
against
whom
charges
had
been
filed
before
the
virginia
inquiry
and
review
commission.
the
article
on
question
was
printed
on
october
1975
by
the
virginian-pilot
and
norfolk
newspaper
which
was
printed
by
landmark.
the
report
in
the
article
was
in
all
relevant
respects
inaccurate.
that
is
not
disputed
indeed
that
is
the
essence
of
the
crime.
the
article
referred
to
then
identify
a
judge
who
had
been
investigated
by
commission,
a
virginia
commission
established
to
investigate
charges,
which
could
be
the
bases
of
retirement
at
censure
or
removal
from
the
bench.
the
article
stated
that
no
formal
charges
had
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
i
did.
there
were
acquisitions
pending
before
the
commissions
and
the
commission
was
inquiring
into
the
acquisitions
which
had
been
charged.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes.
mr.
floyd
abrams
that
is
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
floyd
abrams
that
is
correct.
the
news
article
stated
that
no
formal
compliant
had
been
made
by
the
commission
in
the
supreme
court
of
virginia,
and
it
stated
that
that
indicated
that
the
commission
either
had
filed
insufficient
cause
for
action
or
that
the
case
was
still
under
review
by
the
commission
itself.
a
month
after
the
article
was
printed
landmark
was
indicted
and
charged
under
section
2.
1-37.
13
of
the
virginia
code
with
the
crime
of
having
unlawfully
divulged
the
name
of
a
judge
at
a
time
when
the
judge
was
the
subject
of
an
investigation
and
hearing
by
the
commission.
under
the
section
of
law
under
which
landmark
was
accused
of
violating,
all
papers
filed
with
the
commission
and
testimony
before
it
are
required
to
be
confidential.
any
person
who
divulges,
and
that
is
the
statutory
language,
information
in
violation
of
the
section
is
guilty
of
a
misdemeanor,
a
crime
punishable
in
virginia
by
a
prison
sentence
of
up
to
a
year
and
up
to
$1,000
fine.
at
trial
the
only
evidence
introduce
by
the
commonwealth
other
than
the
article
itself
was
a
stipulation
of
evidence
entered
into
by
the
commonwealth
and
landmark,
which
stated
the
landmark
had
printed
the
issue
in
question
that
the
virginian-pilot
had
published
the
october
4
article,
that
the
article
had
identified
a
judge
who
had
in
fact
been
investigated
by
the
commission,
and
that
at
the
time
the
article
was
published
the
commission
had
not
filed
a
formal
complaint
concerning
the
judge
with
the
supreme
court
of
virginia.
the
latter
part
of
the
stipulation,
i
think
it
maybe
set
it
verdict
to
the
fact
that
under
virginia
law
once
a
formal
charge
is
filed
with
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
everything
about
the
proceeding
which
is
filed
does
becomes
then
public.
no
other
evidence
was
offered
by
the
commonwealth
at
trial.
at
the
trial
landmark
urged
that
properly
and
constitutionally
construed,
the
statute
should
be
held
to
apply
to
the
first
disclosure
of
information
by
a
participant
involved
in
the
proceeding
itself,
but
not
to
the
later
publications
by
a
newspaper
of
information
learned
by
it.
landmark
urged
as
i
urged
today
that
to
apply
the
statute
to
it
for
publication
of
a
news
article
identifying
a
judge
would
violated
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
mr.
floyd
abrams
no,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
whatsoever.
a
january
15
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
think
it
is
a
reasonable
that
the
editor
and
the
journalist
involved
and
know
that.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes
your
honor.
landmark
was
convicted
in
january,
1976
and
fined
$500.
on
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
virginia
their
convection
was
affirmed
by
a
6:1
vote.
i
will,
of
course,
be
considering
the
opinion
throughout
the
course
of
my
argument,
but
i
think
it
may
fairly
be
said,
in
summary
that
the
opinion
held
that
the
statute
applied
to
landmark
and
that
the
statute,
as
so
applied,
was
constitutional.
probable
jurisdiction
was
noted
by
this
court
in
june
of
this
year.
mr.
floyd
abrams
mr.
justice
stevens
i
think
it
would
unless
there
were
some
other
privilege
which
protected
me,
because
i
was
in
this
courtroom
i
have
a
little
doubt
that
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
that
it
would
apply
to
me
if
i
were
to
walk
outside
and
provide
the
name
of
the
judge
with
one
carrier
that
this
court
has
decided,
of
course,
that
once
papers
are
public
we
filed
in
a
court
the
press
may
print
with
impunity
what
is
contained
in
them.
and
so
i
suppose
in
this
particular
case
since
there
was
a
criminal
prosecution
and
since
there
is
the
stipulation
which
i
adhered
it
too
earlier
that
i
could
with
impunity
speak.
if
there
had
been
no
constitution,
if
the
newspaper
article
had
been
printed
and
prosecution
has
followed,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
virginia
statute
must
apply
by
the
terms
of
the
opinion
out
of
virginia
supreme
court
if
i
would
repeat
to
someone
else
the
information
contained
in
the
statute,
i
am
sorry
the
information
contained
in
the
article.
in
the
interim
between
the
ruling
of
the
virginia
supreme
court
and
this
argument
of
three-separated
federal
district
judges
in
virginia
have
enjoined
enforcement
of
the
challenged
portion
of
the
statute
for
various
periods
of
time
as
against
one
or
another
newspaper
or
television
station
in
virginia.
i
think
the
issue
at
the
outset
had
returned
to
the
scope
of
the
statute
as
i
understand
it
as
interpreted
by
the
virginia
supreme
court.
and
it
is
this:
unless
and
until
formal
charges
are
filed
by
the
commission
with
the
supreme
court
of
virginia.
virginia
law
now
makes
it
a
crime
ever
to
publish
any
“information
concerning
a
proceeding
before
the
commission,
including
the
identity
of
a
judge.”
mr.
floyd
abrams
it
would
apply
to
the
person
who
released
the
information.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes
your
honor.
mr.
floyd
abrams
indeed,
if
there
is
no
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes
your
honor,
there
is
no
exception
--
and
i
should
point
out
in
other
respect
that
the
virginia
supreme
court
had
argued
to
it
in
various
narrowing
ways
of
reading
the
statute
and
did
not
adopt
any
narrowing
ways
of
read
it.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
statute
must
be
read,
so
as
to
apply
to
a
statement
by
the
chairman
of
the
commission,
and
indeed
to
make
criminal
the
publication
by
the
newspaper
of
that
statement
even
if
it
were
a
press
conference.
that
i
think
is
the
de
minimis
holding
of
the
virginia
supreme
court.
mr.
floyd
abrams
it
is
my
submission
today
that
it
is
unconstitutional,
as
applied
to
anyone
who
is
not
the
party
before
the
commission.
now
we
have
a
press
case
today,
i
think
that
had
bearing
on
your
honor’s
decision,
but
i
do
not
argue
to
you
today
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
as
it
applies
to
a
participant
before
the
commission
itself.
it
does
seem
to
me
that
there
maybe
some
problems
with
that
but
that
is
not
the
part
of
my
argument.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes
sir.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes
your
honor.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
i
would
say
that
most
of
the
arguments
that
i
will
make
to
you
today
would
apply
as
well
to
someone
that
reads
the
newspaper
and
then
repeats
it
to
someone
else,
because
the
statute
does
go
that
far.
but
my
argument
to
you
today
applies
to
my
crime
and
it
would
apply
any
other
newspaper
which
fits
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
have
not
gone
that
far
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
mr.
floyd
abrams
your
honor,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
only
way
to
read
the
statute
is
that
the
judge
would
have
violated
the
provisions
of
the
statute
of
the
newspaper
if
it
prints
what
the
judge
said
would
have
violated,
and
any
reader
of
the
newspaper
who
repeats
what
the
newspaper
said
would
have
violated.
let
me
take
the
case,
if
i
may,
that
this
court
heard
yesterday,
it
is
the
stump
case,
which
this
court
heard
yesterday
had
arisen
in
virginia.
if
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
had
filed
charges
referring
the
virginia
commission
against
judge
stump
and
if
that
individual
that
had
that
information
had
become
known
to
the
press,
it
would
be
a
crime
for
the
press
who
had
printed
it.
if
the
individual
who
was
the
plaintiff
in
the
case
had
made
a
public
statement
to
that
effect,
it
would
been
a
crime
for
her
to
have
made
that
statement.
the
scope
of
the
statute
is
that
broad,
and
it
seems
to
me
necessarily
that
broad,
given
the
language
of
the
statute
and
surely
the
language
of
the
supreme
court
of
virginia.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
do
not
think
so
your
honor.
certainly
to
the
extent
that
what
we
urge
on
you
is
a
premise
under
press
clause
of
the
constitution
and
it
is.
i
know
of
no
case
which
suggests
that
a
corporation
which
owns
a
newspaper
is
not
entitled
to
fall
first
amendment
rights
as
interpreted
by
this
court.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
would
so
argue
your
honor.
mr.
floyd
abrams
at
least
to
cover
the
press.
certainly,
it
is
never
been
suggested
otherwise
in
any
of
your
press
decisions,
new
york
times
against
sullivan,
there
was
no
less
protection
because
it
was
a
corporation.
mr.
floyd
abrams
as
a
general
matter
your
honor,
it
is
seem
to
me
that
this
case
could
be
decided
as
a
freedom
of
expression
case
without
necessarily
relying
on
the
press
clause
itself.
as
i
suggested
earlier
to
mr.
justice
white,
i
do
think
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
for
many
of
the
same
reasons
that
we
urge
under
the
press
clause,
under
the
speech
clause
as
well,
if
i
would
be
charged
with
a
violation
of
the
statute
for
repeating
what
i
would
read
in
a
newspaper.
we
do
have
a
press
clause
case
today.
i
think
we
are
busted
even
more
by
the
fact
that
it
is
that
kind
of
case
and
that
is
kind
of
statute
strikes
so
directly,
as
we
view
it,
at
press
freedom,
but
even
if
that
were
not
so,
i
think
the
most
of
the
arguments
that
i
am
making
here
today
would
also
apply.
mr.
floyd
abrams
no
your
honor,
no
your
honor.
but
they
certainly
do
reach
corporations
which
publish
newspapers.
we
have
already
discussed
some
examples
of
the
scope
of
the
statute.
i
would
just
cite
one
more,
which
also
arose
in
virginia
in
which
it
is
adverted
to
in
briefs
of
parties.
when
a
virginia
judge
allegedly
dismissed
his
law
clerk
or
a
law
clerk
who
was
testified
against
him
before
the
commission
and
that
allegation
was
contained
ap
wire
service
dispatch
which
went
throughout
the
country
and
into
virginia.
that
story
could
be
only
printed
by
landmark
because
one
federal
judge
in
richmond
had
previously
entered
and
award
enjoining
enforcement
of
the
statute
against
richmond
newspaper
on
first
amendment
grounds,
and
because
another
federal
judge
in
arthur
(ph)
entered
a
temporary
restraining
order
enjoining
prosecution
of
landmark
for
printing
what
the
richmond
paper
has
printed
with
respect
to
the
subject.
but
again
without
question
that
story
would
have
been
forbidden
within
the
scope
of
the
virginia
statute.
it
seems
to
me
important
to
make
clear
also
at
the
outset
what
this
case
does
not
involve.
this
is
not
an
access
case,
the
question
is
not
raised
before
you
today
and
we
have
made
no
claim
in
this
case
of
a
first
amendment
right
of
access
to
the
commission
proceedings
before
our
claim.
this
case
does
not
relate
to
matters
to
personal
privacy
or
of
anything
about
private
figures,
it
relates
only
to
public
officials.
the
case
does
not
here
with
sanctions
imposed
upon
the
press
for
the
imposition
of
intentionally
or
recklessly
false
statements
about
public
officials.
the
case,
of
course,
does
not
deal
that
this
court’s
recent
nebraska
ruling
did
with
issues
relating
to
a
fair
trail
and
the
sixth
amendment
and
first
amendment
right
kept
in
some
kind
of
act
before
us.
and
the
case
does
not
deal
with
any
kind
of
limitation
on
a
conduct
as
opposed
to
free
expression
or
any
kind
of
limit
as
to
time,
place,
or
manner
of
expression.
this
is,
if
the
court
please,
a
classic
rather
old-fashioned
first
amendment
case
in
which
i
think
we
may
return
to
first
principles.
this
is
a
case
which
raises
at
the
outset
at
least,
the
question
of
whether
a
law
does
or
does
not
abridge
freedom
of
the
press
when
it
makes
criminal
the
truthful
printing
of
facts
about
public
officials
where
they
need
to
their
public
duties.
in
our
view
the
very
notion,
that
such
kind
of
publication
may
be
made
criminal
is
upon
to
be
permitted
constitutional
principles.
mr.
floyd
abrams
no
it
is
not
federal
government.
mr.
floyd
abrams
it
is
a
first
through
the
fourteenth
amendment
case,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
floyd
abrams
that
is
pretty
old-fashioned
to
me.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes.
this
court
has
made
clear
that
truth
is
a
defense
a
constitutionally
required
defense
in
a
line
of
cases.
a
truth,
the
court
said
in
the
garrison
case,
may
not
be
the
subject
of
either
criminal
or
civil
sanctions,
where
the
discussion
of
public
affairs
is
concerned,
and
the
court
has
made
clear,
of
course,
in
a
number
of
very
recent
decisions
that
even
truthful
commercial
speech
receives
a
very
wide
degree
of
first
amendment
protection.
how
then
can
a
truthful
report
about
an
official
proceeding
relating
to
the
confidence
of
a
public
official
be
made
a
criminal
offence.
according
to
the
commonwealth
brief,
the
an
expression
at
issue
here
maybe
deemed
unprotected
or
made
unprotected
by
a
virtue
of
the
statute
at
question,
because
it
may
“undermine
the
confidence
of
the
people
in
the
institutions
of
our
free
society.
such
an
explanation,
i
may
respectfully
say
so,
would
be
an
all
too
familiar
one
throughout
most
of
the
world.
that
is
unfamiliar
one,
i
suggest,
for
a
state
to
offer
in
this
court,
and
it
is
one
which
might
leave
in
defense
any
seditious
liable
statute
in
just
so
many
words,
including
the
alien
and
traditional
laws
themselves,
and
even
that
disasteric
relic
of
our
history
permitted
truth
to
be
stated
as
a
defense.
the
reasons
offered
by
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
for
requiring
confidentiality
are
real
ones.
they
may
well
been
proper
as
regard
participants
before
the
commission
itself,
but
they
for
sure
of
any
which
could
conceivably
permitting
(inaudible)
and
to
first
amendment
rights
by
way
of
criminal
punishment
for
publication.
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
relies
first
on
the
question
of
the
reputation
of
the
judge
who
was
accused
by
a
complaint
before
the
commission,
and
the
reputation
of
the
judiciary,
in
general.
but
this
court
has
already
concluded
in
new
york
times
against
sullivan
and
elsewhere
that
injury
of
official
reputation
forwards
no
more
want
for
the
repressing
speech
that
would
otherwise
be
free
than
this
factual
error.
and
in
fact,
the
virginia
statute
as
the
chief
justice’s
question
earlier
suggests
does
permit
as
much
harm
at
assistance
to
judicial
reputation
since
it
makes
criminal
publication
of
the
fact
that
a
judge’s
reputations
has
been
cleared.
there
is
also
the
need
asserted
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
to
protect
complaints
and
witnesses
from
retributions
by
judges
against
whom
they
offered
testimony.
now
this
case,
i
should
say,
does
not
involve
such
a
situation
at
all,
since
all
that
is
involved
here,
the
only
claim
made
here
in
the
indictment
is
that
landmark
unlawfully
revealed
the
name
of
a
judge
under
investigation.
well,
but
the
statute
does
not
even
provide
full
protection
for
witnesses
surely,
and
indeed
under
the
statutory
language,
once
a
claim
is
filed,
once
a
complaint
is
filed
before
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
by
the
commission,
the
judge
against
whom
it
is
filed
receives
full
access
to
the
testimony
against
him,
as
he
should,
and
i
suppose,
at
least
i
would
argue
constitutionally
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes
sir,
at
that
point
it
is
public
then
anybody
has
full
access
to
it.
but
if
the
purpose,
if
the
justification
for
the
kind
of
suppression
as
we
ordered
to
the
punishment,
at
least
as
a
press
in
this
case
is
said
to
be
that
the
witnesses
need
to
be
protected.
my
point
is
that
once
a
charge
is
filed
with
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
everything
does
become
fully
public.
mr.
floyd
abrams
well,
if
no
charge
is
filed
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
it
is
possible
that
the
judge
may
not
know
about
it.
now
we
do
have
an
instance
referred
to,
which
i
referred
to
earlier,
of
a
court
clerk,
at
least
this
is
what
it
alleged
in
the
papers
in
the
case
filed
by
the
court
clerk,
in
which
a
court
clerk
has
alleged
that
as
a
result
of
her
making
charges
against
the
judge
for
whom
she
worked,
she
was
dismissed.
i
think
the
question
does
arise
as
to
whether
a
court
clerk
or
witness
is
better
protected
by
being
able
to
have
the
benefits
of
publicity
in
a
situation
in
which
she
fears
retribution
or
alleges
retribution
than
to
be
deprived
that
the
chance
to
have
anything
said
about
her.
in
short,
what
i
am
saying
is
that
i
understand
that
there
is
an
argument
that
a
statute,
such
as
this,
by
keeping
things
confidential,
helps
to
protect
witnesses
in
that
period
prior
to
a
charge
is
being
filed,
that
there
is
a
counter
argument
that
there
are
situations
in
which
witnesses
are
as
well
protected
by
publicity
at
least
when
they
wanted,
and
this
statue
prevents
that
kind
of
publicity.
and
in
any
event,
as
i
have
said,
that
is
not
really
raised,
as
i
view
it,
by
this
case
since
that
justification
for
the
criminal
punishment
on
landmark
--
is
no
justification
for
criminal
punishment
of
landmark,
since
what
is
involved
here
is
not
the
disclosure
of
a
witness’
name.
if
this
case
did
involve
that
the
court
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
mr.
justice
stevens
that
is
possible,
and
i
do
not
deny
that
the
statute
could
have
in
this
in
other
ways,
the
signatory
effects.
it
does
seem
to
me
that
even
with
respect
to
this
particular
area
of
inquiry
that
one
may
properly
ask,
as
one
does
in
any
first
amendment
case,
whether
there
are
less
restricted
ways
of
going
about
that
task
even
if
protecting
witnesses.
and,
we
have
suggested
in
our
briefs
that
there
may
well
be,
that
there
may
be
monitoring
programs
the
program
of
judges
that
he
had
maybe
made
a
crime,
it
could
be
made
a
crime.
but
before
judge
saw
the
act,
which
would
have
a
desired
chilling
effect,
i
suppose,
upon
a
judge
in
that
type
of
situation.
we
would
submit
to
you
that
whatever
standard
have
used
to
judge
the
statute,
it
cannot
withstand
the
first
amendment
scrutiny
provided
by
this
court.
the
statute
punishes
the
accurate
reporting
of
news.
it
does
so
in
interest
which,
as
i
have
observed,
either
or
not
specifically
raised
in
this
case
or
are
not
protected
under
the
statute
or
which
in
any
event
cannot
under
any
standard
overwrite
first
amendment
interests.
now,
there
is
much
in
the
briefs
filed
before
you
with
respect
to
the
clear
and
present
danger
doctrine.
that
is
not,
we
submit,
a
doctrine
which
should
commend
itself
to
you
for
application
in
this
case
or
perhaps
in
the
other.
i
believe,
and
if
it
did,
we
submit
that
the
interests
involved
here
do
not
approach
that
to
raise
in
the
other
cases
in
which
fair
and
present
dangers
has
been
applied.
mr.
floyd
abrams
well,
it
seems
to
me
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
the
doctrine
has
been
eroded
by
a
variety
of
decisions
of
this
court
brandenburg
versus
ohio,
being
one
of
the
more
recent
ones.
and
indeed
new
york
times
against
sullivan,
being
a
very
recent
one,
at
least
at
applicability
in
the
press
area
if
no
other.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
problem
with
clear
and
present
danger
doctrine
as
often
applied,
at
least
it
is
applied
in
the
dennis
case,
is
that
it
was
changed
so
significantly
from
what
i
perceived
to
be
its
initial
meaning
by
the
adaption
of
judge
hand’s
test
of
the
probability
of
the
harm
just
countered
by
the
likelihood
of
its
occurrence
and
alike.
that
at
least,
as
a
first
amendment
test,
it
does
not
provide
an
awful
lot
of
protection.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
would
argue
that
if
the
schenck
case
were
here
now
and
we
did
not
have
all
the
history
that
we
have,
the
court
could
have
gone
quite
a
bit
farther
than
it
did
in
schenck
itself.
that
the
clear
and
present
danger
doctrine
as
set
fort
in
schenck,
it
did
not
provide,
at
least
on
the
face
of
schenck
ruling,
anything
like
the
kind
of
first
amendment
protection
which
this
court
has
since
come
to
afford
to
the
parties
up
here.
i
do
want
to
make
clear
that
even
the
dennis
holding
of
this
court
which
from
a
(inaudible)
first
amendment
point
of
view,
if
you
will,
is
not
generally
celebrated.
it
is
one
which
we
can
live
under
in
this
case,
because
what
judge
hand
did,
and
what
the
court
did
in
the
dennis
case
was
discharged
with
the
notion
of
the
gravity
of
the
harm,
discounted
by
the
probability
of
the
harm
occurred,
and
what
i
would
urge
on
you
is
that
(inaudible)
case
or
national
security
case
is
a
very
different
level
of
gravity
than
what
we
have
here
and
indeed
the
bridges
case,
and
cases
essentially
involving
six
amendment
rights
or
the
right
to
fair
trial
or
the
right
to
a
judge
who
has
not
placed
in
a
position
where
he
simply
cannot
function.
issue
such
as
that
raised
in
bridges
are
not
raised
in
this
case.
mr.
floyd
abrams
justice
stevens
i
would
say
then
that
for
the
other
reasons
i
asserted
earlier
that,
that
was
a
social
price
which
the
first
amendment
requires
astutely.
people
are
attacked
in
the
press
sometimes
very
unjustly
and
sometimes
are
less
able
to
function
because
of
it.
mr.
floyd
abrams
but,
what
i
would
suggest
is
the
first
of
all,
the
way
the
court
ought
to
approach
such
issue
is
to
try
to
do
so
far
as
it
is
possible
in
terms
of
categories
of
speech
which
are
or
might
are
not
protected
speech
and
then
deal
with
the
question
of
what
kind
of
test
to
apply
to
speech
or
expression
which
mat
not
be
protected.
but,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
starting
place
is,
is
this
the
kind
of
area
in
which
there
could
be
any
limits
on
speech
or
free
expression
at
all?
now
what
we
urge
to
you
at
the
outset
is
that
at
least
with
respect
to
truthful
speech
about
public
officials
in
the
course
of
their
public
functions,
that
there
is
no
area,
none,
for
imposition
of
criminal
sanctions
for
publication.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
think
that
that
has
been
much
eroded
through
the
years
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
at
least
--
but
that
is
depended
upon
one’s
motion
of
what
is
substantive
evil
is.
but
as
recently
as
our
elrod
versus
burns,
the
court
made
clear
that
a
reasonable
kind
of
danger,
a
reasonable
kind
of
state
interest
is
not
enough;
it
has
to
be
at
least
a
compelling
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
there
was
not
a
court
opinion
in
elrod,
but
there
was
a
court
opinion
in
the
buckley
case,
which
used
very
similar
language
as
to
that.
i
do
think
it
further,
say,
that
--
at
least
as
i
read
this
court’s
opinions
that
the
court
has
as
a
body
come
to
the
view
that
the
kind
of
presumption
of
constitutionality
of
the
state
statute
in
this
area
that
used
to
be
applied,
is
no
longer
applied,
and
that
something
more
than
a
reasonable
state
interest
must
exist
so
as
to
permit
the
imposition
of
a
sanctions.
mr.
floyd
abrams
did
the
state
do
what
sir?
mr.
floyd
abrams
the
state
did
--
let
me
say
this
mr.
justice
marshall,
both
sides
argued
in
part
on
the
basis
of
the
clear
and
present
danger
doctrine.
landmark
argue
in
court
below
that
the
clear
and
present
danger
doctrine
could
not
be
made
in
any
event,
because
there
were
no
factual
proof
adduced
by
the
state
and
that
that
least
was
one
of
the
requirements,
a
minimal
requirement
of
application.
mr.
floyd
abrams
the
state
showed
nothing.
the
state
put
in
no
evidence
other
than
that
which
i
have
referred
to.
mr.
floyd
abrams
sorry.
mr.
floyd
abrams
all
that
you
have
is
the
stipulation
of
evidence,
there
was
stipulation
of
evidence
which
was
no
more
than
that
the
article
was
printed
by
landmark
and
that
that
was
what
it
said.
the
only
findings
of
clear
and
present
danger
are
contained
in
the
opinion
out
of
supreme
court
of
virginia
itself.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
mr.
floyd
abrams
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
made
a
finding
that
sanctions
were
indispensable
to
the
prevention
of
the
loss
of
confidentiality.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes
sir.
it
made
that
finding.
it
did
not
base
it
on
legislative
history
since
there
was
none
as
such
save
the
language
of
the
virginia
constitution
which
required
confidentiality
and
the
language
of
the
statute
which
i
have
adverted
to
earlier.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
think
that
is
very
fair
to
say
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
believe
there
is
some
such
laws
your
honor.
there
is
no
federal
law
to
that
effect.
mr.
floyd
abrams
there
maybe.
there
is
none
in
virginia
or
in
new
york.
i
do
not
know
of
any
but,
i
could
certainly
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
it
could
be
your
honor.
it
depends
whether
for
one
thing,
the
court
were
to
view
the
grand
jury
at
least
as
possibly
different
because
of
the
historic
role
of
secrecy
in
grand
jury
proceedings,
but
i
would
say
your
honor
that
it
would
be
our
submission
to
you
at
least
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
that
a
law
which
made
it
a
crime
to
print
a
leak
from
a
grand
jury
would
be
unconstitutional
for
some
of
the
same
reasons
that
we
urge
upon
you
on
this
case.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
that
is
one
very
relevant
difference.
mr.
floyd
abrams
well,
i
think
it
would
cut
at
least
in
the
favor
of
us
in
this
case
and
make
the
grand
jury
case,
if
anything,
a
little
bit
harder.
i
do
want
to
say
mr.
justice
white
that
it
would
be
our
argument
to
you
that
the
press
serves
the
public
well
on
occasion
and
it
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
hope
so
your
honor.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
think
so,
but
one
really
could
distinguish
it.
if
you
believe
that
either
because
of
the
historic
nature
of
the
secrecy
and
reasons
for
it
and
the
peculiar
reason
for
the
existence
of
the
commission
here,
adverted
to
by
the
chief
justice
that
those
were
differences.
i
simply
did
not
mean
to
run
from
your
question
and
suggest
that
if
you
were
to
rule
in
our
favor
in
this
case
that
it
would
have
not
any
bearing
on
the
grand
jury
case.
mr.
floyd
abrams
to
the
extent
what
is
involved
in
the
commission
is
a
determination
of
the
fitness
of
public
officials
for
their
public
service.
it
seems
to
us
that
if
anything
that
cuts
more
in
favor
of
full
or
fuller
freedom
to
publish.
mr.
floyd
abrams
your
honor,
the
fact
the
president
nixon
was
an
unindicted
co-conspirator
was
printed
in
the
press.
i
would
want
to
make
clear
that
i
do
think
that
that
case,
if
there
were
a
federal
statute
that,
as
of
course
there
is
not,
that
that
case
would
be
closed
to
this
but
not
quite
the
same
as
this.
but,
all
i
am
saying
is
that
if
the
question
is
whether
grand
jury
secrecy
in
general
--
i
am
sorry,
if
the
question
is
whether
a
decision
our
favor
in
this
case
would
necessarily
govern
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
with
respect
to
publication
by
the
press
of
information
from
grand
juries
regardless
of
what
the
information
was.
but
i
think
if
one
must
distinguish
between
them
then
we
have
the
stronger
case
because
we
are
always
dealing
here
with
the
fitness
of
public
officials.
mr.
floyd
abrams
absolutely,
that
is
the
of
course
one
of
the
main
reasons
in
favor
of
grand
jury
secrecy.
thank
you.
