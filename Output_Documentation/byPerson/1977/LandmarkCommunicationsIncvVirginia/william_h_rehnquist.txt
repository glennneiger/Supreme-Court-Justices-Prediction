justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
abrams
is
there
anything
in
the
record
of
which
we
may
properly
take
cognizance
of
how
landmark
learned
of
the
facts
that
have
published?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
your
client’s
protection
is
in
anyway
diminished
by
the
fact
that
it
is
a
corporation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
corporations
and
individuals
stand
on
an
equal
footing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
reason
to
think
that
if
it
is
so
as
to
the
press
it
is
different
be
as
to
freedom
of
expression?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
do
you
say
this
clear
and
present
danger
doctrine
is
not
one
which
should
commend
itself
to
us
generally?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
or
would
you
adhere
to
your
same
position
if
we
are
talking
about
justice
holmes’
initial
formulation
of
it
in
schenck?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
you
disagree
with
that
part
of
the
schenck
case
which
talks
about
a
substantive
evil
which
the
government
has
a
right
to
prevent.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
there
a
court
opinion
in
elrod?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
do
not
quite
see
why
you
responded
to
the
chief
justice
and
justice
white’s
question
that
the
difference
in
the
nature
of
the
commission
as
opposed
to
grand
jury
cuts
in
your
favor
rather
than
the
other
one.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
about
the
facts
presented
to
a
grand
jury
that
say
a
high
public
official
or
a
well-known
private
businessman
is
guilty
of
a
crime?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
action
was
not
a
criminal
prosecution;
that
was
kind
of
an
effort
by
the
government
to
enjoin
the
prior
restraint.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
all
of
the
participants
in
the
procedure
had
adhered
to
the
statutory
ammunition
to
confidentiality,
it
would
have
remained
confidential.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that
case
is
not
being
for
us.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
court
does
not
believe
untidiness,
does
is?
