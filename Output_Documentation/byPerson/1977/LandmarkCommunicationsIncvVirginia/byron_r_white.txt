justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
your
submission
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
anybody
or
just
the
press?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let
us
assume
--
so
your
argument
is
that
even
if
it
is
holding
constitutional
to
forbid
the
participants
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
from
disclosing
anything
that
nevertheless
is
unconstitutional
as
apply
to
the
press?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
non
in
your
argument
would
not
question
the
underlying
validity
of
the
statute
as
applied
to
participants,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
abrams
are
there
laws
the
country
against
the
publication
of
grand
jury
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
are
state
laws
against
the
press
publishing
confidential
information
from
grand
juries?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
anyway
i
would
take
it
that
situation
would
be
involved
in
the
decision
of
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
be
about
the
same.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
way
does
it
cut,
mr.
abrams?
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn’t’
you
think
it
would
be
hard
for
you
to
win
this
case
or
lose
the
grand
jury
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
you
hope
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
general
kulp,
i
take
it
you
are
saying
that
the
protection
of
the
judge
and
the
protection
of
the
legal
systems
generally
against
insult
are
secondary
justifications
for
the
statute
that
you
are
saying
that
it
is
necessary
to
have
an
effective
system
to
give,
to
offer
confidentiality.
is
that
your
submission?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
not
contend,
i
take
it
then,
that
the
virginia
statute
that
said,
no
one
may
publish
a
report
that
a
judge
is
incompetent
or
that
he
is
not
doing
his
job
right,
until
they
have
filed
a
complaint
with
the
commission
and
the
commissioner
itself
investigated
and
filed
a
formal
complaint.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
you
would
not
--
would
you
defend
that
kind
of
a
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
was
protection
for
the
judge,
and
protection
at
least
for
the
judicial
system
generally,
that
was
involved.
i
would
take
you
would
defend
that
kind
of
a
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
to
protect
against
insult
to
the
judicial
system
generally?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
is
not
unusual.
