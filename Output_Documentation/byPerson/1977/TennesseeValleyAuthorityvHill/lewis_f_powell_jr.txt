justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
attorney
general,
i
understood
your
principle
argument
to
be
that
the
statute
could
not
fail
to
be
construed
to
apply
to
a
project
that
was
either
completed
or
substantially
completed?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
understand
you
would
have
to
have
a
hearing,
but
if
the
fact
were
simply
this,
that
the
main
dam
in
the
tennessee
valley
is
completed,
nobody
argues
that
it
has
not
been
completed
because
it
has
been
34
years,
suppose
they
found
the
snail
darter
down
in
that
lake
tomorrow,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
claims
you
must
remove
the
dam?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
think
the
statute
applies
to
that?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
think
it
could
be
construed
reasonably
to
think
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
would
require
that
that
dam
be
removed?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
my
question
was
addressed
to
a
completed
project,
one
substantially
completed
and
you
told
us
at
the
beginning
of
this
argument
that
all
that
was
necessary
to
be
done
was
to
close
the
gate?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
tiny
little
bit.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
how
much
money
has
the
government
spent
on
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
$110
million.
the
government
has
appropriated
$2
million
to
transplant
these
darters.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
attorney
general,
may
i
ask
you
a
friendly
question?[laughter]
let
us
assume
that
in
order
to
resolve
this
issue
somebody
introduced
a
bill
in
congress
saying
explicitly
that
section
7
shall
apply
to
every
completed
federal
project
in
the
united
states.
do
you
think
many
congressmen
who
voted
for
that
clarification
of
this
statute
would
be
reelected?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
is
my
point.[laughter]
does
that
not
suggest
that
nobody,
really
no
one,
rationally
could
apply
this
to
a
completed
project?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
one
other,
maybe
a
less
friendly
question.
you
commenced
your
argument
and
i
felt
for
you
by
saying
that
it
was
not
without
precedent
for
two
departments
of
the
government
to
come
down
to
court
in
an
antagonistic
position.
i
speak
for
myself
but,
it
is
not
easy
for
me
to
resolve
issues
of
vast
importance
to
our
country
when
two
cabinet
level
departments
had
sought
to
fight.
i
wonder
why
these
things
are
not
determined
that
the
cabinet
level
rather
than
submitting
it
to
us?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
plater,
judge
mccree
did
write
separately
below,
did
he
not?
do
you
feel
that
he
was
however
joining
the
majority
opinion?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
many
times
up
here,
particularly
concur
in
the
result,
that
means
we
think
the
majority
opinion
is
rather
poor
and
we
have
reasons
of
our
own?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
you
said
that
it
was
a
unanimous
opinion
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--
it
may
be
an
unanimous
judgment?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
plater
may
i
interrupt
you
right
there.
apart
from
the
biological
interest,
which
i
say
you
do
not
challenge,
what
purpose
is
there,
if
any,
by
these
little
darters,
are
they
used
for
food
or
--?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
last
place
has
been
discovered,
i
take
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
are
you
suggesting,
mr.
plater,
that
congress
may
finally
decide
we
better
abandon
the
whole
dam,
at
least
--?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
come
back
to
the
argument
you
are
making
a
few
minutes
ago
that
this
dam
after
all
is
not
important
to
what
congress
intended.
i
read
a
few
words
from
the
senate
appropriations
committee
report
last
year.
the
project
will
provide
needed
flood
control,
water
supply,
recreational
opportunities,
and
improved
navigation.
now,
without
the
dam
and
the
water
in
it,
will
any
of
those
objectives
of
congress
be
attainable?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
was
not
my
question?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
no
recreation?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
have
justice
stewart's
vote
already.[laughter]
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
think
the
senate
of
the
united
states
or
the
senate
appropriations
committee
was
thinking
about
maintaining
the
streams
when
it
was
appropriating
money
to
close
the
dam?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
there
any
record
that
the
members
of
that
committee
voted
against
this
appropriation?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
understand
that
the
bill
on
its
face
does
not,
but
do
you
think
any
--
any
rational
person
could
read
the
reports
of
the
committees
for
the
last
four
or
five
years
and
conclude
that
there
was
any
intention
on
the
part
of
congress
other
than
to
complete
this
project?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
think
that
reflects
any
indication
on
the
part
of
congress
not
to
construe
section
7
as
applying
to
completed
projects?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
kind
of
did
not
hear
my
question
so
i
will
put
another
one
to
you.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
it
still
your
position,
as
i
understand
it,
that
this
act,
section
7,
applies
to
completed
projects?
i
know
you
say
you
do
not
think
it
will
occur
very
often,
but
there
will
be
a
need
to
apply,
but
does
it
apply
if
the
need
exists?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
to
completed
projects.
take
the
grand
cooley
dam?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
am
not
--
i
am
not
asking
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
know.
that
is
your
view.
i
am
asking
you
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--
not
to
project
your
imagination
into
the
future
beyond
accepting
my
assumption
and
that
is
that
an
endangered
specie
might
turn
up
at
grand
cooley,
does
section
7
apply
to
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
is
your
answer
to
my
question.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
dissent
orally
because
the
court's
decision
is
aviate,
is
quite
erroneous
and
will
create
serious
and
far
reaching
consequences.
as
the
chief
justice
has
stated,
this
is
the
famous
snail
darter
case.
the
darter
is
of
three-inch
pitch,
practically
indistinguishable
from
many
similar
small
pitch.
this
has
been
called
a
case
of
a
three-inch
fish
against
a
$120
million
tellico
dam
project,
a
project
located
on
the
little
tennessee
river.
today,
the
fish
wins
100%.
although,
the
dam
has
been
completed
and
all
that
remains
is
to
close
the
gate.
this
court
will
now
issue
a
permanent
injunction,
a
great
reservoir
project
designed
to
save
an
impoverished
area
of
tennessee
is
ended.
this
remarkable
result
comes
about
in
this
way.
the
endangered
species
act
adopted
in
1973
has
a
commendable
objective
of
preserving
species
of
animal
and
plant
life
and
their
habitats
where
they
are
endangered.
in
the
same
year,
the
snail
darter
was
discovered
and
two
years
later,
in
1975,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
found
that
the
tellico
project
would
result
in
destruction
of
the
snail
darter's
habitat.
in
february
1976,
when
the
project
was
80%
completed,
respondents
filed
this
suit
to
enjoin
completion
and
operation
of
the
dam.
the
district
court
held
that
congress
could
not
have
intended
to
produce
such
an
absurd
result.
the
words
i
use
are
those
of
the
district
court
but
the
court
of
appeals
held
and
this
court
now
agrees
that
the
language
of
the
act
requires
the
result,
however
absurd
it
may
be.
it
is
a
language,
we
are
indeed
perfectly
clear.
it
would
be,
as
the
chief
justice
states,
the
duty
of
this
court
to
enforce
it
regardless
of
the
consequences.
it
is
not
the
province
of
the
judicial
branch
to
rectify
policy
of
political
judgments
of
the
legislative
branch,
however
egregiously
we
may
think
they
discern
the
public
interest.
the
issue
thus
presented
to
us
was
one
of
statutory
construction.
did
congress
intend
to
end
federal
projects
whenever
some
form
of
life
is
endangered
by
their
continued
operation.
the
court
thinks
that
both
the
language
and
history
of
the
act
requires
this
result.
it
is
here
that
i
disagree.
the
statutory
language
said
there
is
no
credit
to
whoever
drafted
it.
it
may
be
read
as
the
court
reads
it
but
it
need
not
be
so
read,
it
may
not
be
read
as
applying
to
completed
or
nearly
completed
projects.
this
court
has
said
on
more
than
one
occasion
and
here
i
quote
that
literal
application
of
a
statute
that
would
lead
to
upset
consequences
is
to
be
avoided
whenever
a
reasonable
application
is
to
be
--
whenever
a
reasonable
application
can
be
given
consistent
with
the
legislative
purpose.
thus
a
central
inquiry
is
ascertainment
of
congressional
purpose
and
intent.
i
think
it
is
plain
from
the
total
legislative
history
that
congress
intended
no
such
result
as
that
reached
by
the
court
today.
i
review
briefly
the
highlights,
the
tellico
project
was
authorized
in
1966,
7
years
before
the
endangered
species
act
was
adopted
and
10
years
before
the
suit
was
filed.
in
every
year
since
1966,
congress
has
appropriated
funds
for
the
construction
and
completion
of
this
project.
since
1975,
the
appropriations
committees
of
both
houses
have
been
fully
advised
of
the
project's
effect
on
the
snail
darter.
with
all
other
facts
before
them,
these
committees
have
continued
to
fund
the
project.
moreover,
in
their
reports
to
the
congress,
they
stated
unequivocally
that
the
act
was
not
intended
to
halt
this
project.
the
committee's
recommendations
were
approved
by
both
houses
of
congress
and
signed
in
three
consecutive
years
by
the
president
of
the
united
states.
the
court
brushes
aside
this
post-enactment
history
and
relies
on
contemporary
statements.
it
deems
to
be
supportive
of
its
view,
statements
adopted
at
the
time
that
the
statute
was
enacted.
typical
of
these
statements,
if
one
by
a
member
of
congress
emphasizing
the
importance
with
which
everyone
agrees
of
preserving
endangered
species.
this
congress
then
said,
that
the
air
force
must
discontinue
bombing
practice
along
the
golf
coast
of
texas,
if
this
endangered
the
whooping
cranes,
i
would
certainly
agree
with
that
but
there
is
not
even
a
hint
in
the
legislative
history
that
congress
intended
to
compel
the
undoing
or
abandonment
of
completed
federal
projects.
no
testimony
was
taken
on
this
possibility,
not
a
single
congressman
discussed
it.
if
congress
had
been
aware
that
the
act
could
be
used
to
terminate
major
federal
projects
authorized
years
earlier
or
to
require
abandonment
of
essential
federal
installations.
common
sense
tells
us
that
there
would
have
been
legislative
hearings,
there
would
have
been
testimony,
certainly
there
would
have
been
debate
concerning
the
consequences
so
wasteful,
so
inamicable
to
purposes
previously
deemed
important
by
the
congress
and
so
likely
to
arouse
public
outrage.
the
absence
of
any
such
consideration
by
the
committees
or
in
the
floor
debate
indicates
beyond
all
questions,
that
no
one
intended
today's
consequences.
these
consequences,
unfortunately,
are
not
limited
to
the
tellico
project.
the
court's
decision
casts
a
long
shadow
over
the
continued
operation
of
even
the
most
important
projects,
projects
serving
vital
needs
of
society
as
well
as
national
defense.
if
continued
operation
endangers
a
survival
or
the
critical
habitat
of
a
newly
discovered
species,
a
water
spider
or
cockroach,
operation
of
the
project
could
be
brought
to
a
halt.
if
congress
acts
expeditiously,
the
court's
decision
probably
will
have
no
lasting
at
these
consequences
but
i
had
not
thought
it
to
be
the
province
of
this
court
to
force
congress
into
otherwise
unnecessary
action
to
produce
a
result
no
one
ever
intended.
mr.
justice
blackmun
joins
me
in
this
dissent.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
separate
dissenting
opinion.
