this
is
in
the
--
it
is
not
in
the
record
of
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
everything
in
those
documents
may
not
be
true?
justice

mr.
attorney
general,
with
regard
to
your
statement
a
moment
ago
about
other
agencies
of
government
taking
their
own
position
here
contrary
to
what
the
solicitor
general
might
be,
i
indicated
that
congress
had
expressly
authorized
in
some
instances.
i
just
suggested
this
afternoon
or
tomorrow
we
are
hearing
a
case
in
which
a
federal
communications
commission
is
taking
position
flatly
contrary
to
the
department
of
justice
on
a
case.
so,
it
is
not
a
rarity.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
plater,
i
understand
what
your
position
is
and
what
the
law
means,
but
if
somebody
happen
to
disagree
with
you
as
to
how
to
construe
the
act,
it
might
be
that
the
agency
is
not
violating
the
law
at
all?
your
argument
is
what
the
law
means?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
nevertheless,
your
statement
is
absolutely
incorrect
if
the
act
is
not
--
unless
the
act
is
construed
the
way
you
say
it
should
be
construed?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
one
of
the
issue
in
this
case
is
what
does
the
act
mean?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
you
are
arguing
that
it
should
be
construed
in
a
certain
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
some
other
people
disagree
with
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
