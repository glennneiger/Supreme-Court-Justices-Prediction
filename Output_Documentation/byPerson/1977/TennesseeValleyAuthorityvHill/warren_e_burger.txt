chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
tennessee
valley
authority
against
harem
j.
hill.
mr.
attorney
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
was
before
the
discovery
of
the
existence
of
the
snail
darter,
was
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you
are
saying,
i
take
it,
is
that
the
endangered
species
act
is
not
to
be
applied
or
was
not
intended
by
congress
to
be
applied
to
projects
that
were
already
under
way?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
one
of
the
factors
to
be
weighed
the
fact
that
$120
million
has
been
spent
at
this
point?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
three
times,
this
project
and
the
snail
darter
problem
has
been
called
to
the
attention
to
congress,
has
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
can
veto
the
appropriations,
could
he
not,
and
stop
the
project
any
time
since
1975?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
attorney
general,
did
you
have
any
obligation
to
present
the
views
of
the
secretary
of
interior
or
was
that
merely
a
matter
of
comity
as
one
cabinet
officer
to
another?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
request
by
whom?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
has
it
not
been
historically
true
that
the
united
states
government
in
this
court
and
in
all
federal
courts
speaks
through
only
one
voice,
namely
through
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
historically,
that
has
been
the
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
attorney
general.
mr.
plater.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
pursue
a
question
that
mr.
justice
marshall
put
to
you.
suppose
you
have
$300-
or
400-million
dam,
i
do
not
know
the
value
of
the
one
he
--
the
cost
of
the
one
he
mentioned
and
you
are
confronted
with
the
showing
that,
originally,
there
were
300,000
of
a
particular
species
and
now
by
the
operation
of
the
dam
over
a
period
of
years,
it
is
down
to
10,000
and
it
is
about
to
become
extinct.
are
you
suggesting
that
congress
intended
that
that
dam
should
be
torn
down?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
we
are
asking
you
a
hypothetical
questions
to
test
your
arguments?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
we
did
to
the
attorney
general?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
federal
action
is
the
continuance
of
the
dam?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
mean
that
even
if
a
successful
transplant
took
place,
you
would
still
be
opposing
the
functioning
of
this
dam?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
is
history
of
evolution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
were
not
faced
with
the
conflict
between
the
popfish
and
$122
million-dam
though?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
put
another
question
to
you
that
i
think
is
an
addition
to
that.
you
have
not
discussed
it
yet
and
you
do
not
have
much
time
left.
do
you
suggest
that
any
of
the
legislation
passed
here
has
advocated
the
normal
equity
function
of
the
united
states
district
judge
in
granting
an
injunction,
a
very
extraordinary
relief
that
is
sought
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
he
should
not
function
as
he
does
with
any
other
application
for
an
injunction?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
you
do
not
need
an
injunction
because
that
is
academic?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
question
that
i
am
putting
to
you
is
should
not
the
district
court
confronted
with
an
application
to
enjoin
the
operation
of
a
dam
in
which
$122
million
worth
of
money,
one
way
or
the
other
has
been
invested?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
$110
million?
alright.
$110
million
has
been
invested,
exercise
the
ordinary
functions
of
an
equity
judge
weighing
and
balancing
the
equities?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
includes
the
equitable
discretion
not
to
enforce
the
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
think
it
does
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
this
litigation
first
began
to
block
the
development
of
the
project,
there
was
no
snail
darter
problem
at
all,
was
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
the
snail
darter
was
discovered
and
it
became
a
handy
handle
to
hold
on
to?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
sure
they
just
do
not
want
this
project
for
a
combination
of
plaintiffs?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
have
the
opinion,
judgment
and
opinion
for
the
court
to
announce
in
tennessee
valley
authority
against
hill
and
i
will
discuss
it
only
briefly.
this
case
has
been
identified
as
one
involving
a
three-inch
fish
which
on
the
occasion
of
the
argument,
the
attorney
general
brought
to
the
vector
encased
in
a
small
flask.
it
is
a
species
of
the
perch
family,
which
will,
according
to
all
the
evidence
in
the
case
and
the
findings
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
be
exterminated
if
the
tellico
dam
which
is
project
of
the
tva
complex
is
allowed
to
operate.
the
case
also
involves
$120
million
dam
which
was
authorized
by
the
congress
and
that
dam
is
virtually
completed
and
ready
to
operate.
in
reality,
in
the
view
of
the
majority
of
the
court,
the
case
involves
something
more
important
than
either
a
three-inch
fish
which
is
endangered
as
a
species
or
even
then
$120
million
dam.
as
the
majority
of
the
court
sees
it,
some
very
important
and
fundamental
principles
of
the
separation
of
powers
are
at
stake.
congress
has
categorically
provided
that
no
project
may
be
carried
out,
may
be
carried
out
if
it
endangers
the
existence
of
any
species
which
the
secretary
of
the
interior
declares
is
endangered
and
he
has
done
so
here.
we
hold
then
under
the
established
precedence
of
this
court
and
under
very
express
and
explicit
rules
of
the
congress,
an
appropriation
or
continued
appropriations
do
not
repeal
an
express
statute.
in
our
view,
the
congress
has,
wisely
or
not,
decreed
that
the
endangered
species
have
priority
over
even
a
multi-million
dollar
dam.
in
1966,
in
the
endangered
species
act,
of
that
date
and
again
in
the
1969
act,
congress
declared
that
the
endangered
species
were
to
be
protected
in
effect
so
far
as
practicable
but
in
the
1973
act,
which
is
the
statute
before
us,
it
very
pointedly
removed
those
qualifying
provisions,
created
as
we
see
it,
an
absolute
duty
to
preserve
all
endangered
species.
we
emphasize
that
under
the
constitution,
judges
have
limited
functions
and
we
do
not
review
the
solemness
or
the
wisdom
of
what
congress
does
and
i
will
read
the
essence
of
the
opinion,
i
think,
briefly
from
the
opinion
itself
which
is
filed
this
morning.
our
individual
appraisal
of
the
wisdom
or
unwisdom
of
a
particular
course,
consciously
selected
by
the
congress
is
to
be
put
aside
in
the
process
of
interpreting
a
statute.
once
the
meaning
of
an
enactment
is
discerned
and
its
constitutionality
determined,
the
judicial
process
comes
to
an
end.
we
do
not
sit
as
a
committee
of
review,
nor
are
we
vested
with
the
power
of
veto
and
accordingly,
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
sixth
circuit
that
in
our
constitutional
system,
the
commitment
to
the
separation
of
powers
is
too
fundamental
and
too
important
for
us
to
preempt
congressional
action
by
judicially
decreeing
what
would
seem
to
accord
to
us
as
the
common
sense
in
the
public
wheel.
our
constitution
invests
all
such
responsibilities
in
the
political
branches
and
the
matter
is
now
is
in
the
hands
of
congress.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
powell.
