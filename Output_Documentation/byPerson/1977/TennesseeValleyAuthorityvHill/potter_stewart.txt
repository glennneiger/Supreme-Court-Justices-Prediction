justice
potter
stewart
the
statute
--
the
statute,
the
endangered
species
act,
does
not
distinguish
as
among
various
priorities
of
endangered
species,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
the
snail
darter
is
on
the
list?
justice
potter
stewart
the
statute
requires
more
than
just
consultation
in
good
faith.
it
does
require
consultation,
but
then
it
requires
a
rather
clear
in
unambiguous
words,
“the
agency
to
take
such
action
necessary
to
ensure
that
actions
authorized,
funded,
or
carried
out
by
it
do
not
jeopardize
the
continued
existence
of
the
endangered
species
or
the
destruction
or
modification
of
its
critical
habitat,”
action
necessary
to
ensure
that
--
that
their
actions
do
not
jeopardize
the
continued
existence
and
as
i
understand
it,
it
is
conceded
that
the
completion
of
this
dam
will
jeopardize
the
continued
existence
of
this
endangered
species
or
the
modification
of
its
critical
habitat?
justice
potter
stewart
which
has
been
found
to
be
the
critical
habitat,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
potter
stewart
the
secretary
has
determined
this
to
be
the
critical
habitat,
has
he
not?
justice
potter
stewart
yes
and
has
determined,
this
little
fish
to
be
an
endangered
species?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
seems
the
language
of
the
statute
that
i
have
just
read
aloud
from
my
own
information,
and
to
refresh
your
memory,
it
seems
to
me
to
be
an
unambiguous
requirement?
justice
potter
stewart
yeah,
i
know,
but
it
is
not
what
the
word
is
saying?
justice
potter
stewart
has
there
any
been
any
proposal
in
congress
to
amend
section
7
of
the
endangered
species
act?
justice
potter
stewart
not
to
generally
amend
the
language?
justice
potter
stewart
specific
exemption
or
exclusion
of
this?
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
the
status
of
that?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
attorney
general,
why
should
the
court
remand
this
case
to
have
the
record
be
brought
up
to
date?
a
lot
of
things
happened
since
the
court
of
appeals
decided.
justice
potter
stewart
is
the
secretary’s
refusal
to
remove
the
fish
from
the
list,
he
has
done
that
in
the
last
few
months
you
say,
or
is
it
the
habitat?
justice
potter
stewart
he
refused
though,
did
he
not?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
subject
to
judicial
review?
justice
potter
stewart
if
it
is,
has
reviewed
been
sought?
justice
potter
stewart
i
know,
but
is
the
secretary
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
just
do
not
know
whether
there
are
procedures
to
secure
review
of
the
secretary’s
refusal
to
remove
the
snail
darter?
justice
potter
stewart
by
a
suit
in
the
district
court
or
by
methodically,
i
guess?
justice
potter
stewart
but
to
say
you
concede
there
is
judicial
review
of
the
secretary
of
interior’s
action?
justice
potter
stewart
either
in
putting
species
on
the
endangered
list
or
in
saying
that
for
certain
areas
it
is
critical
habitat?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
a
judicial
review
of
either
finding?
justice
potter
stewart
under
the
administrative
procedure
act?
justice
potter
stewart
or
else
--
else
he
could
simply
say
that
this
is
no
longer
its
critical
habitat?
justice
potter
stewart
or
to
modify
its
critical
habitat,
but
if
this
--
this
continue
to
be
an
endangered
species,
but
if
the
area
to
be
flooded
by
the
dam
is
no
longer
its
critical
habitat,
there
would
be
no
violation
of
the
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
fish
thrived
in
the
hiwassee
river?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
is
not
historically
true
for
every
species.
there
had
been
all
sorts
of
species
imported
in
the
new
areas
where
they
do
much
better
than
they
ever
did
in
their
original
homes?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
if
there
were
voluntary
compliance,
an
injunction
would
be
necessary
and
that
was
hecht
against
bowles?
justice
potter
stewart
but
actions
might
be
the
continued
operation
of
a
dam?
