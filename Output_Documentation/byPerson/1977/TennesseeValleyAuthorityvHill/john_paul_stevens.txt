justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
alive?[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
attorney
general,
your
exhibit
makes
me
wonder.
does
the
government
take
the
position
that
some
endangered
species
are
entitled
to
more
protection
than
others?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
argument
would
apply
to
every
endangered
species,
american
eagle,
no
matter
what
it
might
be,
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
any
of
the
--
on
any
of
the
grounds
that
you
are
suggesting
--
you
are
suggesting
that
the
statute
itself
be
construed
so
there
is
no
violation
here
if
these
--
if
these
gates
are
closed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
is
no
violation
of
the
statute
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
although
the
statute
applies,
you
construe
the
statute
based
on
the
various
facts?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
argument
is
not
that
there
is
a
violation
of
the
statute,
but
an
injunction
is
not
authorized?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
not
your
argument,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
do
not
concede
there
is
a
violation
of
the
statute
though?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
saying
you
construe
the
statute
so
that
closing
the
gates
would
not
violate
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
congress
ever
grant
an
exemption
from
the
endangered
species
act
for
the
snail
and
they
were
very
much
aware
of
this
problem,
were
they
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
not
have
been
the
most
unambiguous
way
to
resolve
the
whole
thing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
much
better
than
just
hiding
it
in
the
committee
report
and
appropriations?
justice
john
paul
stevens
$2
million,
so
they
thought
the
snail
darter
was
worth
$2
million,
but
not
$130
million?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
attorney
general,
can
i
ask
one
question
about
your
argument
about
why
the
statute
does
not
apply.
are
you
saying
that
the
statute
merely
requires
consultation
or
are
you
saying
that
completing
the
dam
would
not
be
an
action
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
admitting
it
would
be
an
action?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course
that
would
still
be
possible,
mr.
attorney
general,
if
we
were
to
sustain
the
injunction
congress
could
always
exclude
the
snail
darter
later,
but
if
we
let
the
snail
darter
be
extinguished,
i
guess
the
choice
is
irrevocable,
is
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
secretary
has
found
that
they
will
be
extinguished
if
the
dam
is
closed.
you
disagree
with
the
facts,
but
do
we
not
have
to
assume
that
is
the
fact
for
purposes
of
decision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
therefore,
it
is
not
the
critical
habitat,
is
that
right?
what
assumption
do
we
make
for
purposes
of
deciding?
is
the
snail
darter
going
to
be
extinguished
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
has
found
that
it
will
be,
has
he
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
do
we
not
have
to
assume
that
when
we
decide
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
attorney
general,
are
you
suggesting
that
if
the
secretary
of
interior
has
placed
a
specie
on
the
endangered
species
list
that
the
attorney
general
could
have
the
power
to
take
it
off
the
list?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no
matter
what
we
do,
that
part
of
the
record
is
before
us.
the
secretary
of
interior
has
determined
that
this
is
an
endangered
specie.
we
have
to
accept
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
cannot
second
guess
him
on
that,
can
we?
justice
john
paul
stevens
anymore
than
you
can.
justice
john
paul
stevens
exactly.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
plater,
let
me
just
interrupt
you
with
one
question.
there
has
been
an
awful
lot
of
discussion
about
things
that
have
happened
since
the
district
court
tried
this
case.
is
any
of
that
relevant
to
our
decision,
anything
the
attorney
general
said
or
anything
you
have
been
telling
us
in
response
to
all
these
questions?
we
have
a
finding
of
fact
that
this
closing
the
dam
would
result
in
total
destruction
of
the
snail
darterâ€™s
habitat.
do
we
have
to
know
anything
else?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
what
respects,
mr.
plater,
would
it
apply?
it
would
apply
only
to
future
action,
would
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
statute
does
not
ever
require
anybody
to
tear
anything
down,
does
it,
no
matter
how
--?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
certainly
cannot
conduct
certain
actions
in
the
future
if
they
are
going
to
extinguish
the
species,
that
is
what
it
says.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there
is
nothing
that
would
require
you
to
tear
a
dam
down?
