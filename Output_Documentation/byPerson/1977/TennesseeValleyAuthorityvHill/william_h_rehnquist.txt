general
bell,
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
the
tellico
dam
itself
is
on
the
little
tennessee
prior
to
its
confluence
with
the
tennessee?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general,
when
you
say
balance
in
the
equitable
factors,
is
one
of
the
ways
that
that
would
be
done,
the
decision
of
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
whether
an
equitable
injunction
would
issue?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
plater,
is
it
not
at
least
unarguable
part
of
the
intent
of
congress
that
the
government
simply
leaves
certain
areas
of
nature
alone
without
necessarily
having
a
reason
for
living
them
alone,
but
just
that
they
did
not
want
any
more
elimination
of
species
and
so
forth?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
hecht
against
bowles
says
you
do
not
get
an
injunction
automatically
for
a
statutory
violation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
do
not
agree
with
you,
mr.
plater
because
you
have
a
long
history
of
equitable
adjudication
where,
for
instance,
a
building
was
built
over
a
lot
line
and
there
has
been
a
contest
throughout
out,
but
the
chancellor
does
not
reach
a
decision
until
the
building
is
finally
built
and
he
may
say
apply
the
common
law
which
is
--
has
the
same
sanction
to
him
as
the
legislative
law
passed
by
congress,
“i
will
give
you
damages.
i
will
not
give
you
an
injunction.”
now,
why
is
this
not
an
appropriate
case
for
that
sort
--?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
said
it
is
just
the
opposite
in
hecht
against
bowles.

of
