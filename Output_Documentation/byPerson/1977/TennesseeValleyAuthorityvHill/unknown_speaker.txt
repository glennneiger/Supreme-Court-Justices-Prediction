unknown
speaker
general
bell,
there
is
something
in
the
briefs
about
efforts
of
transplantation
and
i
wondered
can
you
bring
us
up
to
date
on
that?
have
they
been
successful?
and
secondly,
i
would
like
to
know
whether
the
construction
already
done
to
the
dam
has
so
endangered
the
species
that
it
is
not
going
to
survive
anyway?
unknown
speaker
where
were
they
transplanted?
unknown
speaker
yes,
we
have.[laughter]
unknown
speaker
mr.
attorney
general,
to
what
agency
was
that
$2
million
appropriated?
unknown
speaker
what
is
tva
supposed
to
do?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
to
see
if
they
can
do
something
which
will
not
jeopardize
the
continued
existence
of
the
species?
unknown
speaker
and
if
they
fail?
unknown
speaker
i
know.
the
fact
that
congress
said
here,
“here
is
$2
million.
see
if
you
can
do
something
about
preventing
jeopardy
to
the
continued
existence
of
the
species.”
i
would
think
that
would
suggest
that
congress
intended
as
i
“cannot”
and
then
they
cannot
go
on
the
dam?
unknown
speaker
all
we
know
is
there
is
a
one-line
appropriation,
i
take
it,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
--
unknown
speaker
if
it
came
to
the
president
to
veto,
what
would
be
vetoed,
the
committee
report
or
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
not
a
change,
that
is
just
the
maintenance
of
the
status
quo?
unknown
speaker
it
is
a
refusal
of
the
secretary
changes
the
status
quo.
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
a
change?
unknown
speaker
perhaps
you
may
have
heard
that
when
mr.
justice
frankfurter
was
serving.
he
thought
that
was
just
outrageous
on
behalf
of
the
solicitor
general
to
come
here
and
offer
us
conflicting
views
of
two
cabinet
departments,
and
he
said
so.
unknown
speaker
the
trouble
is
that,
in
some
instances,
congress
has
expressly
authorized
it.
unknown
speaker
under
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
unknown
speaker
mr.
plater?
unknown
speaker
are
they
suitable
for
bait?
i
am
a
bass
fisherman.
unknown
speaker
they
are
indigestible.
unknown
speaker
mr.
plater,
what
did
you
mean
when
you
suggested
congress
is
now
reconsidering,
what
--?
unknown
speaker
i
am
sure
it
still
does.
