mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
zygmunt
plater
for
respondents.
in
this
case,
the
respondents
quite
simply
support
the
unanimous
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
that
the
tva
must
obey
the
law.
although
the
case
arises
from
a
conservation
issue,
it
essentially
turns
on
traditional
questions
of
separation
of
powers
in
administrative
law.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
yes,
your
honor.
judge
mccree,
below,
said
that
he
concurred
with
the
result
of
the
court’s
opinion,
the
fact
also
that,
indeed,
the
tva
project
must
be
enjoined
because
it
would
eliminate
the
species
from
the
face
of
the
earth.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
your
honor,
i
do
not
want
to
second
guess
judge
mccree,
but
it
might
be
noted
--
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
excuse
me?
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
unanimous
position
taken
by
the
sixth
circuit
that
this
project
should
be
enjoined,
and
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
unanimous
position
then
taken
by
the
sixth
circuit
and
a
position
taken
by
the
department
of
interior
and
by
respondents
comes
down
essentially
two
basic
points.
the
first
point
is
that
congress
in
1973
when
these
species
were
discovered,
wrote
a
mandatory
statute
to
the
agencies
that
it,
itself,
congress
had
created
prohibiting
those
agencies
from
taking
actions
which
would
jeopardize
or
destroy
endangered
species.
and
that
section
is
clearly
violated
by
the
dam
portion
of
the
tellico
project
and
secondly,
congress
has
not
changed
the
law,
although
congress
is
reviewing
public
interest
resolutions
for
the
conflict,
congress
has
not
changed
the
law,
and
this
court
should
not
amend
the
law.
that
is
precisely
what
tva’s
position
is
asking
the
court
to
do.
to
construct
some
form
of
implied
informal
grandfather
clause
exemption
for
this
project
back
in
1973
as
well
as
at
the
present,
and
construct
some
sort
of
informal
statutory
amendment
overriding
the
endangered
species
act
based
on
appropriations
funding.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
your
honor,
that
is
a
question
also
like
the
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
powell
and
the
point
is
the
biologists
tell
us
that
if
you
could
find
the
species
in
a
completed
project,
that
would
be
a
biological
indication
that
that
population
was
not
endangered
by
the
dam
because
indeed
it
was
living
there,
established
there,
breeding
and
then,
of
course,
no
completed
dam
would
have
to
be
taken
down.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
no,
your
honor.
all
they
have
is
biological
authority
to
assert
that
the
endangered
species
is
there
and
is
threatened
by
the
present
circumstances.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
if
they
are
wrong,
then
this
answers
the
question
posed
also
by
mr.
justice
white.
there
are
proceedings
currently
under
way
in
district
court
in
tennessee
challenging
another
listing
of
an
endangered
species
arguing
that
the
department
of
interior
is
wrong.
that
is
the
way
to
do
it.
the
biological
opinion
of
the
secretary,
once
established,
is
established
and
is
not
to
be
overturned
by
lawyers
trying
to
debate
biology.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
the
current
pending
action
seeks
a
delisting
of
a
species
that
has
already
been
listed.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
there
appears
to
be
and
respondents
have
no
legal
argument.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
i
am
not
sure
what
he
basis
of
the
claim
there
is,
your
honor.
i
only
know
that
the
case
is
pending.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
your
honor,
that
of
course
is
not
this
case.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
that
is
a
good
point.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
your
honor,
the
question
is
whether
there
is
a
remaining
prospective
federal
action
which
will
jeopardize
the
species.
it
is
clear
under
the
act
that
the
agency
does
a
statutory
duty
to
take
measures
to
try
to
conserve
the
existence
of
the
darter,
but
the
question
of
whether
in
a
situation
where
there
are
no
federal
actions
remaining,
nevertheless
the
agency
--
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
in
that
situation,
your
honor,
that
certainly
is
a
question
that
would
have
to
be
raised.
we
do
not
take
a
position
on
that
argument,
but
the
point
is
congress
appears
to
have
carried
--
cared
very
clearly
about
preventing
the
extinction
of
species.
there
were
two
prior
statutes,
in
1966
and
1969,
which
gave
agencies
discretion
and
the
court
is
reviewing
them
to
balance
the
question
and
those
statutes
did
not
work.
so
that
section
7
was
written
in
1973
as
mandatory.
your
honor’s
question
is
one
that
is
certainly
difficult
to
handle.
i
think
that
the
easiest
way
to
handle
that
is
perhaps
to
take
the
hypothetical
that
general
bell
ably
brought
out
and
that
is
this.
there
may
be
cases
where
the
public
interest
is
so
intimately
involved
with
--
with
the
case
and
a
species
would
be
jeopardized
that
indeed
there
must
be
a
hard
decision
taken
and
the
species
rendered
extinct.
now,
that
has
never
had
to
occur.
there
is
never,
in
human
history,
been
a
conscious
extinction
of
the
species,
but
we
say
that
indeed
that
may
be
the
case.
the
point
is,
however
--
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
we
know
approximately,
your
honor
and
this
is
--
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
in
the
present
case,
your
honor,
we
do
not
have
a
full
record
on
the
transplantation,
but
these
are
the
facts
as
best
we
know
them.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
your
honor
--
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
no,
your
honor,
it
would
not
be
if
the
secretary
of
interior
changed
--
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
your
honor,
if
the
secretary
of
interior
changes
the
listing
of
the
species
and
the
critical
habitat
then
clearly
this
case
is
no
longer
--
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
excuse
me,
i
misunderstood.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
all
right.
your
honor,
the
factual
situation
presented
in
our
brief
is
up
to
date
as
well
as
is
known
by
anyone
and
that
is,
in
this
situation,
tva
claims
that
approximately
2,000
fish
now
exist
in
the
hiwassee,
but
as
they
revealed
in
the
senate
hearings
and
noted
in
footnote
20
of
our
brief
--
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
your
honor,
that
is
based
on
arithmetic.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
the
tva's
biological
data
perhaps
is
determinative
here.
in
december
of
last
year,
they
did
transects
in
the
hiwassee
river
and
they
revealed
out
of
710
fish
that
were
put
in,
five
fish
left
in
the
transects
on
the
original
shawls
and
i
believe
it
was
nine
juveniles
near
the
flowage
of
the
ocoee
river.
that
is
the
latest
scientific
evidence
on
how
many
fish
are
on
the
hiwassee.
tva,
therefore,
concluded
that
the
transplant
is
working
well,
but
dispersed.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
your
honor,
i
have
checked
the
records
of
the
secretary
of
interior
(voice
overlap)
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
your
honor,
they
may
be
reasons
for
this
case
to
be
remanded,
however,
transplantation
is
not
a
fulfillment
of
the
act,
and
therefore,
that
would
be
an
incidental
inquiry.
we
believe
that
in
--
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
not
at
all,
your
honor,
but
we
would
request
that
the
legal
procedures
be
followed.
if
the
transplantation
were
a
success
so
the
species
were
no
longer
endangered,
the
secretary
of
interior
petitioned
by
tva
would
review
the
biological
data
for
this
court
and
for
congress,
would
certify
that
it
is
no
longer
endangered,
would
take
it
off
of
the
list
and
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
question.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
your
honor,
under
the
act,
i
believe
that
both
of
the
elements
are
separate
violations,
that
is
to
say
it
is
illegal
for
an
agency
either
to
render
a
specie
extinct
or
to
destroy
its
critical
habitat.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
unless
the
secretary
--
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
your
honor,
if
the
fish
thrives
in
the
hiwassee
river,
then
indeed
as
mr.
chief
justice
burger
suggested,
through
this
procedure
this
case
would
come
to
an
end,
but
that
does
not
appear
to
be
the
biological
evidence.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
appears
that
the
best
place
for
species
to
live
is
in
its
only
known
natural
habitat.
i
would
indicate
to
the
court
that
--
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
your
honor,
however,
apparently
the
hiwassee
river
is
connected
geographically
to
the
little
tennessee
and
biologists
tell
us
that
if
the
hiwassee
were
a
good
habitat
for
the
species,
it
would
be
there
by
the
process
of
evolution.
but,
rather,
this
species
turns
out
to
be
a
highly
sensitive
indicator
of
precisely
the
qualities
of
the
habitat
that
the
citizens
were
fighting
about
in
this
case
for
years
before
the
snail
darter
was
known
to
exist.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
no,
your
honor.
when
congress
passed
the
law,
it
made
it
clear
that
the
purpose
of
the
act
was
to
prohibit
the
extinction
of
species
for
a
variety
of
reasons.
one
of
them
is
where
there
is
a
food
value
or
direct
economic
value,
others
for
scientific
study
and
a
philosophical
question
that
indeed
a
specie
should
not
be
eliminated,
biological
diversity,
but
ultimately,
there
is
a
utilitarian
purpose
which
is
served
precisely
by
the
snail
darter.
that
is
to
say,
even
though
it
does
not
have
food
value,
as
--
as
i
was
indicating,
it
is
highly
sensitive
to
clean,
clear,
cool
flowing
river
waters
and
after
68
dams
through
the
tva
river
system,
68
of
them,
one
after
another,
the
range
of
the
snail
darter
has
apparently
been
destroyed,
one,
by
one
until
this
last
33
river
miles
is
the
last
place
on
earth
where
the
species
and
human
beings
as
well
have
the
qualities
of
the
habitat.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
your
honor,
tva
has
looked
everywhere
for
snail
darters.[laughter]
it
searched
--
it
appears
that
this
river
system
--
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
your
honor,
if
snail
darters
were
in
the
base
of
this
building
then
i
suspect
they
would
not
be
in
danger.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
they
would
have
found
them,
your
honor,
and
there
would
be
a
bounty
on
the
snail
darter’s
head.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
your
honor,
the
little
tennessee
river
has
a
fine
bass
population
in
lower
stretches
both
small
mouth
and
large
mouth,
but
they
do
not
appear
to
be
interested
in
the
snail
darter
which
is,
perhaps,
why
the
snail
darter
had
survived
also.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
pardon
me?
your
honor,
the
snail
darter
holds
over
very
shallow
shawls.
it
is
a
highly
specialized
fish
as
i
was
indicating,
an
indicator
of
water
quality.
instead
of
a
dead
one,
i
have
left
with
the
clerk
several
prints
which
were
exhibit
12
at
trial
which
show
the
species
in
its
natural
habitat
along
the
bottom
of
the
water
and
this
would
be
eliminated.
there
are
now
2,500
miles
of
dammed
up
river
in
the
tennessee
area,
more
than
twice
the
coastline
of
all
the
great
lakes
combined
and
this
is
the
last
such
stretch
of
river
which
is
left.
the
hiwassee
transplant
in
--
in
the
evidence
that
justice
marshall
was
discussing
does
not
currently
appear
to
be
successful
and
this
little
tennessee
river
appears
to
be
the
only
place
where
the
fish
would
live.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
the
devil’s
hole
popfish
case
which
this
court
decided
was
such
a
case
where
there
was
one
small
area
which
was
made
into
a
reserve.
this
court
unanimously
upheld
that
reservation
--
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
your
honor,
that
is
not
the
conflict
in
this
case
either.
the
$120
million
which
your
honor
refers
to
is
the
total
project
cost,
but
the
project
is
not
primarily
the
dam.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
dam
structure
cost
$5
million,
a
large
part
of
which
was
labor
plus
earth
works.
it
is
talked
about
as
a
dam
because
that
was
certainly
the
focus
for
tva’s
planning.
the
$120
million,
your
honor,
is
for
the
purchase
of
38,000
acres
of
land,
less
than
half
of
which
was
to
be
flooded.
that
was
condemned
for
resale
at
a
profit
to
pay
off
the
cost
of
the
project.
25,000
acres
of
those
are
prime
agricultural
lands.
and
to
say
that
that
would
be
lost
by
destroying
this
darter,
excuse
me,
by
--
not
to
consider
the
fact
that
the
project
includes
land
purchase,
roads
and
bridges
which
are
immensely
beneficial
for
the
people
and
to
focus
on
the
dam
itself
which
congress
itself
is
now
reassessing
completely
is
to
lose
sight
of
the
reality
of
the
situation.
the
conflict
in
this
case
is
between
an
agency
which
has
since
1973,
when
there
was
only
a
little
bit
of
that
concrete
there,
out
of
$120
million
to
be
spent,
in
1973
they
took
the
position
that
they
would
not
comply
with
the
endangered
species
act
and
as
we
noted
on
page
13
of
our
brief,
doubles
the
rate
of
expenditure,
excuse
me,
trebled
the
rate
of
expenditure,
doubled
the
amount
of
money
spent.
that
is
to
say
the
conflict
in
this
case
is
between
an
agency
which
did
not
want
to
consider
anything,
but
the
original
dam
as
proposed.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
yes,
your
honor.
once
the
injunction
came
down,
the
sixth
circuit
said
the
law
will
be
enforced,
that
is
the
role
of
the
courts
and
the
biological
violation
has
clearly
been
shown.
they
were
immediately
a
series
of
actions
taken
in
the
proper
committees
with
jurisdiction
over
the
act,
that
is
to
say
the
house
merchant
marine
and
fisheries
committee
and
the
senate
public
works
and
environment
committee.
they
requested
the
gao
study
to
review
the
cost
evaluation
of
the
dam
project
and
they
found
that
it
was
highly
unreliable
and
second,
to
look
at
what
alternatives
there
were
even
today
for
resolving
this
issue.
mr.
justice
powell
talked
about
it
as
dam
which
is
fully
completed
and
no
other
alternatives.
that
is
the
way
the
petitioner
would
characterize
it,
but
congress
is
not
doing
so.
the
gao
study
indicated
that
there
are
a
series
of
project
modifications
which
were
suggested
to
tva
as
early
as
1974
which
they
rejected
again
and
again,
which
still
today
appear
to
be
even
more
profitable
than
the
dam.
farming,
for
instance,
is
the
first
industry
of
tennessee
and
it
would
be
destroyed
in
this
valley
area.
tourism
is
the
second,
and
i
note
in
appendix
b,
this
dam
project
is
up
against
the
smokey
mountains.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
no,
not
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
your
honor,
congress
is
weighing
one
hand
the
original
dam
project
which
includes
valuable
investment
in
roads,
bridges,
in
the
valley
and
the
purchase
of
lands.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
precisely.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
that
is
exactly
right.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
yes,
your
honor.
the
dam
has
always
been
only
a
small
portion
of
the
project.
the
project
was
passed
not
for
hydro
power
purposes;
electrical
power,
barge,
those
were
all
minor.
it
was
passed
to
create
industrially
subsidized
lots
and
more
recreation
in
an
area
where
you
have
already
got
22
recreational
lakes
within
60
miles.
congress,
indeed,
is
saying
that
although
we
have
lost
not
$120
million,
but
something
far
less
than
half
of
that,
the
value
of
the
remainder
may
be
several
times
greater
than
the
purported
claims
for
the
dam.
that
is
to
say
congress
is
reviewing
it
and
your
honor
i
am
pleased
to
announce
that
the
agencies
are
reviewing
it
as
well.
in
the
reply
brief
of
tva,
it
is
noted
that
the
new
director
of
--
of
tva
has
agreed,
the
dam
is
not
integral
to
this
project,
the
project
has
benefits
which
can
be
achieved
as
well
or
better
without
the
destruction
of
the
valley
by
a
reservoir.
secondly,
i
was
informed
just
today,
your
honors,
that
the
secretary
of
interior
has
requested
tva
and
tva
have
agreed
to
consult
--
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
your
honor,
our
case
is
fully
sufficient
on
the
record.
it
shows
that
there
is
a
violation.
it
shows
that
congress
and
the
law-making
committees
is
considering
exactly
the
question
your
honor
suggested
--
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
that
is
exactly
right,
your
honor.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
your
honor,
it
is
clear
in
the
record
that
this
project
was
being
made
for
general
regional
economic
development.
it
is
the
last
dam
in
the
tennessee
valley
authority’s
building
history.
it
is
the
most
marginal.
it
is
the
last
one
on
a
list
of
1933
dams.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
no,
your
honor,
i
agree
completely
with
your
honor’s
question.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
not
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
your
honor,
that
question
is
an
important
one.
we
do
not
advocate
the
stripping
of
this
court
or
any
court
of
the
equitable
powers.
indeed,
your
honor,
we
rely
on
your
honor’s
decision
in
rondeau
versus
mosinee
paper
corporation
and
that
is
to
say
the
equity
courts
had
the
full
panoply
of
powers
required
to
enforce
the
law
of
congress.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
we
do
not
insist
on
an
injunction.
if
petitioner
agreed
to
obey
the
law
voluntary
as
the
hecht
corporation
did
in
that
case
or
as
the
mosinee
paper
company
agreed
in
your
honor’s
case.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
that
is
precisely
right
and
the
law
will
be
complied
with.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
$110
million.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
yes,
your
honor.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
does
have
equitable
discretion.
let
me
describe,
however
--
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
let
me
take
the
far
out
hypothetical.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
taking
the
tellico
dam
today
and
advancing
it
to
the
point
of
completion,
that
is
to
say
they
will
still
have
to
cut
down
trees,
bulldoze,
scrape
and
strip
the
valley,
they
would
have
to
construct
the
dam
--
the
canal,
they
would
have
to
get
the
gates
ready
for
closing.
at
that
point
if,
if
for
instance
your
honor,
discover
that
the
whooping
crane
required
that
valley
to
breed
and
that
if
the
valley
were
closed
the
breeding
would
be
eliminated.
breeding
is
considered
important
for
the
continuation
of
the
species
and
the
district
court
could
not,
it
seems
to
us
in
that
case,
your
honor,
take
on
the
question
which
is
essentially
a
very
legislative
question
of
what
should
be
done
with
the
tellico
dam?
for
instance,
the
court
would
then
have
to
go
into
the
full
cost
accounting,
your
honor.
it
would
have
to
consider
what
is
the
true
value
of
this
dam
as
originally
made?
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
for
several
reasons.
number
one
is,
as
your
honor
noted,
damages
of
course
is
not
a
remedy.
once
a
species
is
rendered
extinct
as
congress
said,
it
is
extinct
forever.
secondly,
of
course
that
would
be
involving
private
parties
under
the
common
law.
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
in
cases
which
involve
a
congressional
statute
that,
indeed,
the
--
the
principle
which
guides
the
court
in
the
exercise
of
its
--
of
its
discretion
is
enforcing
the
law
which
is
not
been
set
up
by
common
law,
but
by
statute.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
no,
your
honor.
we
are
not
arguing
that
an
injunction
must
be
issued.
under
the
hecht
case
--
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
that
was
precisely
in
the
hecht
case.
yes,
your
honor.
the
hecht
case
said
if
compliance
with
congressional
statute
would
otherwise
be
achieved,
the
court
of
course
need
not
issue
an
injunction.
we
will
be
pleased
if
an
injunction
would
not
have
been
necessary
in
this
case,
because
in
1973
when
all
options
were
fully
open,
although
congress
appears
to
indicate
and
the
gao
study
indicates
that
option
still
are
open
today,
we
will
be
in
a
much
better
position
to
review
the
question.
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
your
honor,
it
should
be
noted
that
the
appropriations
committee
at
no
time
has
ever
reviewed
the
gao
study,
the
reviews
taking
place
in
the
other
committees,
and
so
on.
it
turns
out
--
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
your
honor,
it
is
true
that
there
would
be
no
flood
control
and
there
would
be
no
electric
power
in
the
project.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
no,
that
is
not
so,
your
honor.
the
river
is
the
last
place
left
in
the
river
system
that
has
high
quality
water
conditions.
it
is
the
finest
trout
stream
in
the
southeast
of
the
united
states.
people
come
from
alabama,
georgia,
and
all
over
to
fish
because
--
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
your
honor,
it
is
the
last
place
for
flowing
water
recreation,
as
the
gao
noted,
because
there
had
been
so
many
impoundments
--
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
your
honor,
i
--
i
believe
that
the
relevant
discussion
is
in
the
committee
that
has
law-making
jurisdiction
over
the
act
and
they
clearly
are
concerned
about
recreation,
and
the
house
side
as
well.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
your
honor,
the
appropriations
bill,
on
its
face,
does
not
purport
to
treat
tellico.
it
says
nothing
about
tellico.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
your
honor,
i
believe
that
one
reading
those
reports
would
find
clearly
and
specifically
that
indeed
congress
had
no
intent
to
amend
the
act,
and
that
is
one
of
the
requirements
for
taking
an
appropriations
bill
or
an
appropriations
committee
report
and
reading
out
of
it
an
informal
implied
amendment.
there
must
be
some
indication
of
an
intent
to
amend
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
1977,
your
honor,
senator
stennis
specifically
said
“if
we
put
such
an
amendment
in
here
it
would
be
subject
to
a
point
of
order.”
i
think
your
honor’s
question,
however,
reflects
the
fact
that
certainly
the
appropriations
committee
or
certain
members
of
it
probably
did
not
agree
with
the
endangered
species
act
or
wished
that
it
did
not
apply
in
this
case,
but
there
was
no
intention
expressed
to
amend
and
that
is
the
only
basis
upon
which
we
could
use
that
to
change
the
law.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
the
appropriations
bill
as
every
appropriations
bill
is
passed,
presumes
that
the
agency
will
comply
with
all
applicable
relevant
law.
the
agencies
are
creatures
of
congress.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
thank
you.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
to
the
continuation
of
--?
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
your
honor,
if
there
were
species
there
--
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
--
it
would
not
be
endangered
by
the
dam.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
i
see
your
honor
--
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
i
believe
it
would,
your
honor.
the
secretary
of
the
interior
--
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
yes,
it
would.
the
consequences
of
that
of
course
--
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
well,
your
honor
as
we
--
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
it
certainly
says
nothing
about
that
in
the
act,
your
honor.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
if
that
situation
would
arise,
your
honor,
it
would
probably
be
a
biological
rarity
in
the
sense
that
if
the
species
comes
when
the
water
goes
up
and
down
then
it
is
established
there
and
it
is
not
endangered.
maybe
the
way
to
answer
this
is
on
the
basis
of
the
administrative
record,
because
in
the
hearings
last
summer,
the
culver
hearings
in
the
senate,
it
was
again
and
again
noted
that
the
biological
expertise
of
the
department
of
interior
is
capable
of
handling
many
sophisticated
such
questions
and
there
has
never
been
a
case
that
could
not
resolved
through
good
faith
in
administrative
consultation.
there
had
been
4,500
potential
conflicts.
there
had
been
hundreds
of
actual
conflicts,
but
only
tva
testified
that
the
act
was
unworkable.
every
other
administrative
agency
said
that
although
the
act
sometimes
was
a
bother,
that
they
could
resolve
these
conflicts.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
that
was
the
situation
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
in
1973,
tva
knew
about
it.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
no,
of
course
not,
your
honor.
[laughte]thank
you
for
reminding
me.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
the
nipa
(ph)
suit
your
honor,
which
was
filed
in
1971
noted
that
there
possibly
were
endangered
species
in
the
river.
tva
had
noticed,
bu,
at
that
time
of
course,
your
honor,
it
was
the
old
act
which
allowed
tva
to
have
the
discretionary
flexibility
that
now
they
are
trying
to
read
into
this
act,
applied.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
your
honor,
the
question
of
the
snail
darter
clearly
went
specifically
to
the
qualities
of
this
habitat,
that
is
as
you
suggest,
the
citizens
have
been
concerned
about
for
years.
that
is
to
say,
the
last
free
flowing
clear
--
clear
such
big
river
left
in
the
region.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
there
are
combinations
of
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
many
with
different
points
of
view.
as
i
note,
the
snail
darter
is
integral
to
the
environmental
conservation
balance
question
which
has
been
litigated
over
the
years,
but
one
of
our
plaintiffs,
for
instance,
is
the
association
of
southeastern
biologists
has
no
interest
for
conservation
purposes,
but
for
biological
purposes,
it
is
taking
what
i
believe
is
its
first
public
stand
to
show
that
a
biological
statute
of
congress
is
important
to
be
enforced.
the
agency
should
not
violate
the
law
with
impunity.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
honor,
that
is
where
we
would
leave
the
case.
the
act
is
working
on
the
record
except
in
this
case.
this
is
the
only
agency
that
is
persistently
declined
to
comply
with
the
law
and
of
course,
in
1973,
there
were
all
options
open.
that
is
the
relevant
time
to
question
when
indeed
tva
should
have
looked
at
this
act
and
decided
that
it
like
every
other
federal
agency,
would
abide
by
the
law.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
only
tva
is
making
that
argument.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
yes,
your
honor,
if
this
act
is
discretionary,
the
way
the
old
law
was
written,
if
this
act
does
not
mean
what
it
says
then,
indeed,
this
lawsuit
was
false.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
the
regulations
of
the
department
of
interior,
every
holding
in
the
case
so
far,
and
every
other
agency.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
yes,
they
do.
mr.
zygmunt
j.
b.
plater
thank
you,
your
honor.
