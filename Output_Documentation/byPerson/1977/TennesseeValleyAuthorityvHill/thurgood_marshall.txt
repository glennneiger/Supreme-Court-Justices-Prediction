justice
thurgood
marshall
but
tva
did
ask
for
it
to
be
taken
off?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
general,
it
is
easy
to
dump
it
on
us
and
we
have
never
even
seen
the
snail
darter?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
one,
you
do
not
even
know
if
he
is
alive.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
attorney
general,
what
would
happen
if
you
found
some
snail
darters
in
the
basement
of
this
building?
we
tear
the
building
down,
this
building?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
icc
is
the
only
one.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
would
you
have
done
if
snail
darters
are
on
chickamauga
dam
under
tva?
what
would
you
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
suppose
the
department
of
interior
say
it
was,
it
appeared
in
chickamauga
dam?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
suppose
they
say
that
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
and
they
are
wrong?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
we
know
right
now
how
many
snail
darters
are
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
many
have
been
removed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
we
not
need
that?
suppose
where
they
now
live
and
they
are
six
and
eight
inches
long
and
they
are
just
having
a
ball
--[laughter]--
would
your
--
would
your
argument
be
the
same?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
your
argument
be
the
same?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
would
not
have
any
argument,
would
you?
should
we
not
find
that
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
was
not
my
question.
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
question
was,
should
we
not
know
what
the
transplanted
snail
darters,
how
they
are
faring?
should
we
know
that
before
we
decide
this
case?
i
am
not
talking
about
the
secretary
of
interior,
i
am
talking
about
us.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
can
we
accept
it
when
you
are
now
getting
ready
to
say
that
what
they
say
is
not
true?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
do
we
know
what
is
true?
we
are
not
a
fact-finding
body.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
i
may
correct
you,
that
is
the
latest
scientific
evidence
you
know
about.
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
there
is
some
other
records
available,
do
you
seriously
object
to
this
going
back?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
have
not
checked
the
basement
of
our
building
here?[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
would
not
have
found
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
could
not
call
roads
endangered
species,
could
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
what
we
are
talking
about.
we
are
not
talking
about
closing
down
the
roads.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
the
question
was,
was
congress
considering
what
was
going
to
be
done
about
this
particular
matter,
including
snail
darters
like
this
one
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
not
roads?
justice
thurgood
marshall
just
speaking
for
myself,
i
am
not
interested
in
what
you
discovered
today.
i
have
got
a
record
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
the
record
not
also
show
that
this
dam
was
not
for
hydraulic
purposes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
do
you
not
say
that
is
what
you
are
told
today
because
that
is
in
the
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
do
you
not
rely
on
the
fact
that
even
though
a
facility
is
all
built,
if
you
knew
about
it
when
you
started
building,
is
that
what
you
say
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
what
i
mean
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
not
(voice
overlap),
are
you?
