mr.
griffin
b.
bell
your
honor
and
may
it
please
it
the
court.
i
appear
on
behalf
of
the
government
in
this
case.
my
colleague,
mr.
daniel
freidman
is
here
with
me,
as
does
mr.
herbert
s.
sanger,
jr.
who
is
a
general
counsel
to
the
tva.
in
this
unusual
case,
as
attorney
general,
i
agree
that
the
secretary
of
interior
could
take
a
position
opposite
our
position
in
this
court
and
i
have
included
--
i
have
stated
his
position
in
writing
as
an
appendix
to
our
brief.
i
understood
that
this
is
not
violating
any
policy
of
the
court.
historically
going
back
into
the
eisenhower
administration,
on
--
on
a
rare
occasion,
this
has
been
done.
i
am,
of
course,
not
arguing
the
secretary
of
interior’s
position,
but
it
is
well-stated
in
our
note
to
court,
the
court
will
take
note
of
it.
now,
this
case
presents
a
conflict
between
the
snail
darter,
an
endangered
specie
under
the
endangered
species
act
and
the
tellico
dam
project
which
is
part
of
the
tva
system.
tellico
dam
project
is
just
not
a
project,
it
is
a
multipurpose
project
designed
to
create
an
amicable
body
of
water,
lake
to
power,
industrial
development,
flood
control,
and
recreation
on
the
little
tennessee
river.
the
little
tennessee
river
had
its
origins
in
the
mountain,
mountains
of
north
georgia,
flows
in
the
northwest
direction
generally,
in
the
knoxville
tennessee
area
and
finally
into
the
tennessee
river,
and
meets
the
dams
in
the
tva
system
or
the
tennessee
river.
there
are
12
dams
on
the
little
tennessee
river
already.
there
is
not
a
dam
in
the
last
34
miles
of
the
little
tennessee
before
it
reaches
tennessee.
so
you
have
got
34
miles
of
open
free-flowing
stream
now.
the
dam
in
question,
tellico,
is
located
at
the
confluent
to
the
little
tennessee
and
tennessee.
it
will
impound
a
body
of
water,
rather
large
at
the
point
of
the
dam,
bagging
up
the
river
for
the
31
of
the
34
miles
to
some
extent.
it
will
not
--
that
dam
itself
will
not
generate
electrical
power,
but
this
dam,
tellico
would
then
there,
the
fort
loudon
dam
on
the
tennessee,
near
the
canal
connection,
some
850-feet
where
this
extra
water
will
be
impounded
on
the
tennessee,
little
tennessee
will
go
over
into
the
fort
loudon
impoundment
and
there
it
will
be
used
to
generate
electricity
in
the
fort
loudon
generating
plant
and
will
generate
enough
electricity
to
supply
roughly
20,000
homes.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
right,
just
before
the
confluence.
i
think
it
will
help
if
i
give
a
brief
chronology
of
the
project.
it
was
authorized
by
congress
in
1966.
construction
began
in
1967.
in
1972,
there
was
a
lawsuit
commenced
based
on
the
fact
that
they
had
not
filed
an
environmental
statement.
that
litigation
went
on
for
about
a
year-and-a
half.
it
went
to
the
district
court,
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
twice
and
finally
tva
prevailed.
they
commenced
working
again
on
the
dam
and
on
the
project.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
yes,
sir.
it
was
in
december
of
‘72
that
it
began,
august
’73,
the
snail
darter
was
discovered.
the
snail
darter
is
a
darter
of
the
perch
family.
there
are
130
known
varieties
of
darters.
there
are
85-90
in
tennessee
alone.
there
are
11
in
the
little
tennessee
river.
there
had
been
8-10
darters
discovered
in
this
last
five
years.
it
is
known
as
a
snail
darter
because
it
eats
fresh
water
snail
which
are
found
on
the
bottom
of
the
little
tennessee.
i
have
in
my
hand
a
darter,
a
snail
darter,
it
was
exhibit
7
in
the
case
when
it
was
tried
and
we
brought
it
with
us
so
that
you
can
see
it.
it
is
3
inches.
it
would
be
a
full
grown
snail
darter,
about
3
inches
in
length.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
i
have
been
wondering
where
its
end
is,
if
it
is.[laughter]
but
it
seems
to
move
around.
i
have
been
puzzled
with
all
that.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
well,
we
have
--
i
--
i
do
not
take
it
as
one
because
i
do
not
have
to.
i
do
not
have
to
reach
that
point.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
absolutely,
that
is
what
the
sixth
circuit
held.
i
would
not
say
that.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
it
does
not.
it
looks
to
the
list.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
once
it
gets
on
the
list,
it
is
a
--
it
is
an
endangered
specie
and
then
this
case
it
goes
much
further
because
a
critical
habitat
is
a
thing.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
it
is
on
the
list
and
this
particular
area
has
been
designated
as
a
critical
habitat,
which
means
that
under
the
holding
of
the
court
we
cannot
move
the
snail
darter
as
we
have.
that
would
not
be
enough.
you
have
to
save
the
habitat.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
there
has
been
a
transplant.
it
has
been
going
on
since
’75.
the
best
information
i
have
is,
this
is
an
unusual
record.
there
is
a
lot
of
things
that
you
can
find
out
by
looking
in
the
petition
to
the
secretary
and
all
sorts
of
things,
it
has
been
successful.
there
are
some
700
transplanted.
there
are
about
2,000
there
now.
it
has
been
going
on
for
two
years.
the
argument
is
it
takes
3-5
years
to
be
sure
that
there
has
been
a
successful
transplant.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
they
were
transplanted
from
the
little
tennessee
to
the
hiwassee
and,
there,
they
found
a
singular
body
of
water,
stream,
and
snail
--
fresh
water
snail
for
darters.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
some
of
it
is
in
the
record,
not
the
success
story.
it
is
in
public
documents
that
we
filed
with
the
secretary
when
we
tried
to
take
the
--
the
petition
filed
to
take
the
snail
off
of
the
list.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
exactly.
i
am
not
saying
it
is
the
truth.
truth
is
what
i
found.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
they
did
and,
after
a
year,
the
secretary
denied
it
just
in
the
last
two
or
three
months,
maybe
in
december.
after
this
darter,
snail
darter
was
discovered,
of
course,
tva
had
unusual
agents
and
they
only
have
authority
to
do
whatever
they
can
get
money
to
do.
they
are
self-authorizing
known
in
the
government
and
they
have
to
get
money
every
year.
there
has
been
money
appropriated
for
this
dam
every
year
through
’77
and
it
is
a
small
figure
in
the
’79
budget
to
complete
it.
the
dam
itself
is
completed.
all
you
have
to
do
is
shut
the
gate,
close
the
gate
just
all
the
way.
it
is
just
sitting
there.
if
you
will
notice
in
one
of
the
amicus
briefs,
southeast
legal
foundation,
they
have
got
some
data
they
have
developed
out
of
the
secretary
of
interior’s
record
that
the
snail
darter
is
gone
anyway
that
once
they
built
these
sluice
gates
in
--
again
in
the
(inaudible)
dams,
the
lava
drift
downstream
and
they
are
not
able
to
get
back.
so,
it
is
not
enough
to
just
leave
it
or
hold
if
you
have
to
do
something
to
the
dam
to
take
part
of
it
out
to
restore
the
natural
habitat.
in
the
chronology,
they
were
various
things
said
in
the
congress
which
i
will
mention
in
my
argument.
the
issue
presented
is
all
the
construction
of
the
endangered
species
act
section
7,
the
district
court
wanted
to
buy
it
on
the
balance
of
equities,
taking
the
position
that
it
was
not
to
be
applied
completely
retroactively
that
you
ought
to
consider
the
stage
of
development
of
project.
the
sixth
circuit
said
because
there
was
no
other
way
to
preserve
the
habitat,
much
less
the
darter,
that
they
had
to
give
literal
effect
to
the
statute
and
enjoin
the
project
no
matter
what
stage
of
completion.
the
statute
itself
is
set
out
on
page
2
of
my
brief
and
the
critical
language
is
number
one;
shall
consult,
but
then
says
that
the
agency,
that
would
be
the
tva
here,
in
carrying
out
programs
refers
to
taking
such
action,
the
agency
must
take
such
action
necessary
to
ensure
that
actions
authorized,
this
was
the
key
language,
funded
or
carried
out
by
them
do
not
jeopardize
the
continued
existence
of
such
endangered
species.
now,
our
argument
is
that
by
the
way
that
--
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
can
be
construed
to
support
the
district
court
and
allow
this
dam
to
be
completed
and
operated
and
in
the
end
they
have
cited
other
things
that
i
will
argue
to
support
that.
the
district
court
used
a
hypothetical
which
draws
--
really
draws
the
better
than
anything
i
found
in
a
whole
case.
the
district
court
said
if
the
plaintiff’s
argument
were
take
into
its
logical
extreme,
that
will
require
court
to
hold
impoundment
of
water
behind
a
fully
completed
dam
if
an
endangered
specie
was
discovered
in
the
river
on
the
day
before
the
impoundment
was
scheduled
to
take
place.
the
district
court
said
that
would
be
too
extreme.
the
circuit
court
said
“we
disagree.”
that
is
what
the
act
means.
you
would
have
to
shut
down
the
dam
the
day
before.
we
say
that
that
is
so
extreme
that
it
would
prohibit
an
agency
from
maintaining
a
facility
that
was
found
to
threaten
a
habitat
of
a
newly
discovered
endangered
species.
we
not
only
say
that
by
way
of
argument,
the
secretary
has
put
it
in
his
regulations,
50
cfr
402.03,
just
that.
that
section
7
applies
to
all
activities
where
a
federal
control
or
involvement
remains,
which
in
itself
could
jeopardize
an
endangered
specie
or
critical
habitat.
so
that
is
the
issue
that
is
presented.
it
is
the
issue
that
must
be
resolved.
can
there
be
a
balance
in
the
equitable
factors
in
deciding
whether
this
action
taken
in
the
meaning
of
the
statute
can
be
taken.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
yes
sir.
we
think
the
three
key
actions
modified,
governed
by
the
ways
authorized,
funded,
or
carried
out.
if
you
give
carried
out
the
same
meaning
on
a
para
material
basis
as
authorized
or
funded,
it
would
read
then
that
the
agency
had
to
have
choices.
what
are
the
alternatives?
now,
ordinarily
there
are
choices.
here,
there
were
none.
it
was
one
or
the
other
as
justices
at
both
courts
saw
it.
the
two
cases
where
there
were
choices
was
sandhill
crane
case
in
the
fifth
circuit
where
the
choice
and
option
and
alternative
available
to
the
director
of
transportation
was
simply
to
move
another
change
and
save
the
sandhill
crane.
now,
that
is
the
national
wildlife
federation
versus
coleman.
the
other
case
was
the
indiana
bat
case
which
was
in
the
eight
circuit
and
there
the
--
and
i
got
into
this
thinking
what
is
the
scheme
of
this
statute.
the
secretary
admits
in
his
regulations
that
the
coleman
holds
as
does
this
eighth
circuit
case
sierra
club
versus
froehike
that
the
secretary
of
interior
does
not
have
the
veto
power,
but
the
act
also
allows
a
suit
by
a
citizen.
so,
the
citizen
can
go
in
court
and
get
the
court
to
veto.
that
is
what
happened
here.
they
said
you
cannot
use
this
project.
so,
i
started
looking
and
try
and
find
the
scheme
of
the
statute
because
somebody
has
got
to
face
it
somewhere
along
the
line
and
it
seems
to
me
the
eight
circuit
in
sierra
club
versus
froehike
had
it
right.
that
--
that
--
that
case
in
--
they
said
that
this
impoundment
behind
this
dam
would
fill
caves
with
water
and
destroy
the
indiana
bat.
there
were
some
facts
showing
it.
there
were
a
lot
of
bats
in
different
parts
of
the
country
not
all
the
bats
in
this
area
--
within
missouri
would
be
destroyed.
the
court
said
the
way
to
approach
this
is,
first,
have
in
mind
that
the
secretary
of
interior
does
not
have
a
veto.
all
the
duty
on
the
acting
agencies
is
to
consult.
consider
all
the
alternatives
and
then
retest
it
and
that
is
reviewable
in
court,
and
retest
it
on
an
abusive
discretion,
was
it
an
abusive
discretion?
i
think
in
essence,
that
is
what
the
district
judge
did.
he
took
all
the
factors.
he
said
this
dam
is
finished
for
all
intents
and
purposes.
they
have
moved
these
darters,
snail
darters
over
to
another
place.
we
do
not
think
that
the
statute
was
intended
to
be
applied
retroactively,
at
least
it
was
a
presumption
that
it
should
not
be
applied
retroactively,
taking
all
these
things
into
consideration,
i
hold
that
the
dam
can
be
used
and
the
project
move
forward.
in
other
words,
he
applied
the
endangered
species
act.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
well,
i
think
it
does
apply.
no,
i
am
not
saying
it
does
not
apply.
it
does
apply
but
then
you
consider
what
stage
of
development
is
the
project
in,
what
are
the
reasonable
alternatives?
could
you
change
it?
could
you
change
the
design?
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
exactly.
that
would
be
one
and
the
district
judge
weighed
that.
i
think
this
kind
of
language
is
the
strongest
argument
in
the
favor
of
my
position
that
i
have
been
able
to
find
as
i
found
the
secretary’s
own
regulation
which
was
in
effect
when
the
district
court
decided
this
case.
this
was
what
they
call
a
tentative
regulation.
it
was
not
a
final
regulation,
but
this
is
what
it
said
“neither
federal
wildlife
service
or
the
national
fishery
service
as
part
of
the
department
of
interior
intends
that
section
7
bring
about
the
waste
that
can
occur
if
an
advanced
project
is
halted.”
this
is
on
--
on
a
footnote
on
page
28
of
our
brief.
the
effective
agency
must
decide
whether
the
degree
of
completion
and
extent
of
public
funding
of
a
particular
project
to
justify
an
action
that
may
be
otherwise
inconsistent.
that
is
when
the
secretary
had
a
chance
to
write
a
regulation
before
he
had
ever
found
out
about
the
sixth
circuit
opinion.
he
did
not
know
they
were
going
to
hold
as
it
did.
his
regulation
has
since
been
changed,
to
recite
the
sixth
circuit
opinion
or
the
sixth
circuit
ruling,
but
this
was
before
we
had
any
ruling,
he
thought
this
is
what
directly
the
statute
meant.
now,
that
is
one
--
one
argument.
the
next
argument,
first
is,
you
can
read
this
language
itself
as
a
line
that
the
district
court
result
and
is
avoiding
the
highest
result
of
the
circuit
court.
this
second
one
is
the
secretary’s
own
regulation
at
that
time.
third
is
that
congress,
three
times:
’75,
’76,
’77,
said
“go
forward
with
this
project.
we
know
about
the
snail
darter.”
this
was
in
a
committee
report,
granted
in
the
figures
of
this
statue,
“go
forward.
we
intend
for
you
to
complete
this
project.”
that
was
a
--
that
was
a
--
we
do
not
have
to
argue
it
was
a
pro
tanto
modification
of
the
endangered
species
statute,
we
say
that
that
is
persuasive
of
the
construction
that
the
district
court
had
found.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
that
is
right.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
no
violation.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
balancing
the
factors,
i
would
say
it
applies.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
that
is
it.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
that
is
my
argument.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
no,
i
do
not
concede
there
is
a
violation.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
that
would
prevent
there
being
a
violation.
the
facts,
taken
as
a
whole,
would
prevent
there
being
a
violation
of
the
statute.
i
do
not
concede
it.
i
say
this.
i
concede
the
statute
applies
though.
i
think
it
does
apply.
excuse
me.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
well,
that
would
be
like
--
i
don't
know
if
a
court
has
jurisdiction,
bell
v.
hood.
you
have
to
have
a
hearing
to
find
out
if
you
have
jurisdiction.
you
would
have
to
have
a
hearing
to
see
if
the
statute
could
be
read
as
applying
to
these
particular
facts.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
that
is
exactly
right.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
i
do
not
think
the
statute
can
be
applied
to
that.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
i
do
not.
that
would
be
a
completed
project.
that
is
farther
than
our
case.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
close
the
gate,
plus,
that
is
a
dam.
now,
there
are
some
roads
to
be
completed.
that
is
a
$1.8
tens
of
millions
in
the
’79
budget,
but
that
is
to
complete
some
roads
and
bridges.
the
dam
itself
is
finished,
all
the
landscaping
has
been
done,
and
that
sort
of
thing.
so
it
is
completed.
i
have
not
argued
that
it
is
a
sort
of
a
thing,
say,
where
a
road
has
been
finished
and
five
years
later
they
found
something
there,
an
endangered
species,
and
they
say
would
they
remove
the
road.
here,
a
good
example
would
be
if
they
found
a
plant
growing
on
a
bank
of
this
lake,
sometimes
when
they
have
the
water
down,
during
the
winter
time
they
would
lower
the
water
5-feet
and
they
find
this
plant
and
say
you
will
never
raise
the
water
back
up
because
there
is
still
action
to
be
taken.
there
was
a
little
action
left
to
be
taken
here.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
[laughter]very
little,
but
a
little.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
$110
million.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
i
have
not
gotten
to
that.
in
the
1977
appropriations
act,
they
appropriated
$2
million
to
transplant
the
snail
darter.
i
view
that
as
a
consultation
by
congress,
not
only
by
the
agency,
but
the
congress
got
into
it
and
tried
to
resolve
the
problem.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
it
has
been
and
every
time
they
said
“go
forward.”
that
would
be
the
last
point
that
i
would
argue
if
i
need
to
argue.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
they
were
aware
of
it.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
that
would
be
it
and
that
is
my
last
point.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
in
’77,
they
put
it
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
$2
million
to
move
it.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
i
would
say
that
that
would
be
fair
--[laughter]
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
fair
to
fair
inference.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
that
one.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
[laughter]no,
that
is
right.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
i
am
saying
that
completing
the
dam
would
be
--
i
am
saying
it
would
be
an
action.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
right,
because
there
is
still
some
action
to
be
taken.
but
i
am
saying
that
when
you
view
what
--
whether
you
are
violating
the
statute,
whether
there
ought
to
be
an
injunction,
now
that
is
all
a
citizen
is
entitled
to
get
as
an
injunction
under
this
endangered
species
act.
you
have
to
consider
all
the
factors
in
before
the
chancellor
acts
and
i
think
the
statute
does
not
prevent
considering
all
the
factors.
one
fact
is
that
this
dam
is
basically
completed.
another
fact
is
that
they
have
--
they
have
moved
the
snail
darter
over
to
another
place
in
an
effort
to
accommodate
snail
darters.
third
is
that
the
law
is
very
clear
that
the
secretary
of
interior
does
not
have
the
veto.
has
the
--
has
the
tva
consulted
in
good
faith
and
done
all
they
can
do
under
these
circumstances?
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
we
do
not
concede.
we
concede
it
will
modify
this
critical
habitat.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
well,
unless
this
moving
over
to
the
hiwassee
river
makes
that
into
a
non-critical
habitat.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
at
the
time.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
right.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
well,
that
is
what
the
sixth
circuit
said.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
not
to
me.
in
the
first
place,
i
--
i
do
not
--
i
think
you
very
often
say
is
a
statute
intended
to
be
retroactive?
there
is
a
presumption
against
retroactive
construction
of
the
statute.
this
is
certainly
retroactive.
it
has
been
applied
retroactively.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
no.
i
do
not
know.
you
would
have
to
ask
the
sixth
circuit.
i
think
they
would
enjoin
you
from
a
function
if
they
found
it
to
be
a
critical
habitat.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
yes,
they
asked
to
exclude
this
snail
darter.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
not
that
i
know
of.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
of
the
snail
darter.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
it
is
pending
on
a
committee
and
it
has
not
come
out
of
the
committee
as
i
understand.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
if
you
did
that,
but
i
do
not
know
of
anybody
trying
to
extinguish
a
snail
darter.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
no.
the
record
shows
clearly
that
the
snail
darter
has
been
transplanted
to
the
hiwassee
river.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
we
cannot
find
that.
only
the
secretary,
under
the
law,
can
find
that.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
that
is
what
he
found
at
one
time.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
well,
i
do
not
think
so.
i
think
it
does
violate
the
statute.
it
violates
presumption
against
retroactivity
to
apply
this
finding
to
this
basically
completed
project.
i
think
the
statute
means
that
you
have
to
have
some
choices.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
tva.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
carry
on
with
their
project
to
transplant
the
snail
darter.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
right,
which
they
have
been
doing.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
they
have
not
failed.
there
has
never
been
a
hearing
on
that.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
i
would
say
that
congress
is
trying
to
accommodate
both
problems.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
that
is
right.
that
is
it.
then
you
know
what
is
in
the
committee
reports.
the
committee
reports,
three
times
three
years,
have
said
go
forward.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
but,
it
have
not
been
in
the
statute.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
he
will
veto
the
statute.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
he
has
not
done
that.
he
has
put
it
in
the
1978
budget.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
that
is
exactly
right.
it
might
well
want
to
do
that.
i
am
not
objecting
to
it.
i
am
not
advocating
that.
i
think
that
the
sixth
circuit
is
in
error.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
well,
he
did
not
have
a
hearing
on
it.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
he
refused.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
i
do
not
know.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
no,
i
think
you
could
have
a
review
on
the
denial
of
due
process,
to
begin
with,
that
you
cannot
get
a
hearing.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
the
case
is
pending
on
him.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
i
know.
i
am
satisfied
you
can
review
it
on
an
administrative
procedure
act.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
i
think
it
would
go
to
district
court.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
it
is
a
denial
of
a
--
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
right.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
i
have
not
even
looked
into
that.
i
thought
we
would
come
up
here
with
the
case
and
see
what
happens
before
we
get
to
worrying
about
getting
the
secretary
to
change.
the
secretary,
at
one
time,
took
the
position
that
you
had
to
wait
three
years
to
know
if
the
transplant
was
successful.
we
are
in
the
third
year
now.
it
has
not
been
three
years.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
no,
but
they
would
not
vote
for
it
to
begin
with.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
it
does
to
me.
under
the
sixth
circuit
holding,
it
would
have
to
be
applied.
that
regulation
is
saying
now.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
you
say
that
is
not
so
friendly.
it
is
a
very
friendly
question.
it
gives
me
an
opportunity
to
say
that
i
do
not
feel
with
this
system.
we
have
one
attorney
general
and
one
solicitor
general,
and
i
think
it
ought
to
be
it.
as
long
as
you
can
do
it,
people
will
ask
you
to
do
it.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
i
do
not
favor
it
myself.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
they
have?
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
but
in
this
case,
we
should
speak
with
one
voice.
we
speak
with
two
because
the
court
will
permit
it
is
the
argument
made
to
me.
at
no
one
time
we
have
done
it
since
i
have
been
attorney
general.
i
do
not
favor
it,
but
i
am
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
say
so.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
it
was
more
than
that.
it
was
a
request.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
by
the
secretary.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
that
is
what
it
ought
to
be.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
that
is
and
i
started
in
the
case
of
meeks,
there
has
been
this
one
instance.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
no.
i
am
not
suggesting
that.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
and
that
that
is
a
critical
habitat.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
that
is
his
prerogative,
not
mine.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
no.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
if
you
will
see
his
brief,
he
has
not
complained
about
that.
he
thinks
we
are
trying
to
change
the
substantive
law
about
appropriations
bill
and
that
we
are
contesting
his
regulations.
that
is
his
main
point.
mr.
griffin
b.
bell
the
interstate
commerce
commission
does,
but
those
are
about
statute.
this
is
about
a
statutory
action.
