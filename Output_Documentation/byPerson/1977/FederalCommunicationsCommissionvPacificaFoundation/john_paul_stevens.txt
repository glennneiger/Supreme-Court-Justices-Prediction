mr.
marino
i
do
have
a
question
–-
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
take
it
that
the
commission's
positions
is
that
these
words
are
indecent
but
not
obscene.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
mean
that
if
this
particular
record
or
these
particular
words
are
said
over
say
a
cb
radio
transmission
from
an
automobile
to
another
automobile
or
something
like
that,
would
the
person
playing
the
record
or
saying
the
words
commit
a
crime?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that.
(vocie
overlap)
the
commission's
view
is
on
whether
that
would
be
a
crime
if
these
were
to
the
same
record
we
played
same
time
of
day
over
a
cb
transmission,
the
statute
would
seem
to
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
my
question
is
under
your
construction
of
the
statute
would
playing
this
record
and
saying
these
words
over
a
cb
at
2
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
constitute
a
crime?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
a
criminal
statue,
isn't
it?
there
is
no
statute
except
the
criminal
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
ask
you
again,
would
it
constitute
of
crime
in
the
opinion
of
the
federal
communication
commission
or
do
you
have
a
position
on
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
take
the
view
that
the
statue
can,
in
the
same
words
in
the
same
statute,
can
mean
different
things
in
different
proceedings?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
am
still,
i
am
sorry
i
didn't
mean
to
--
i
am
still
not
completely
clear
on
whether
the
commission
takes
the
position,
at
the
same
statutory
meeting,
can
have
the
different
same
statutory
words
have
a
different
meaning
in
a
civil
proceeding
for
cancellation
or
whatever
it
might
it
be
and
also
--
than
it
has
an
organic
member
proceeding.
in
other
words
can
the
word
“indecent”
have
a
broader
meaning,
in
one
proceeding,
it
has
another
one
in
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
the
public
interest
theory,
but
to
the
extent
that
you
rely
on
the
criminal
statute
do
you
say
that
word
has
different
meaning
depending
on
the
kind
of
proceeding
that
is
brought
to
enforce
that
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
to
the
extent
that
you
rely
on
that
statute
do
you
contend
that
the
same
word
has
two
different
meanings
depending
on
the
nature
of
the
proceeding
that's
brought?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
claiborne,
just
to
follow
up
on
justice
powell's
question,
your
conclusion
of
course
is
quite
tentative
in
the
last
paragraph
as
i
read
it.
do
i
correctly
understand
that
if
we
were
to
adopt
judge
leventhal's
view
and
say
that
all
that
is
before
us
is
the
broadcast
as
i
mean
these
words
as
broadcast
using
his
limitation
and
we
only
passed
on
that,
is
it
the
department's
view
that
there
would
not
be
constitutional
power
in
the
commission
to
prohibit
this
specific
broadcast
in
this
specific
time
and
context?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that
mr.
marino.
may
i
go
back
to
your
question
of
your
statement
about
censorship,
section
326,
is
it
the
commission's
position
that
if
the
commission
regards
something
as
indecent,
profane
or
obscene
in
its
judge
--
in
its
expert
judgment
it
concludes
that
it
fits
within
that
category,
that
then
it's
entirely
outside
the
provisioning
and
censorship.
justice
john
paul
stevens
those
–
the
judicial
--
well,
excuse
me,
go
ahead!
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
you
give
us
the
easy
case.
if
it's
unprotected
speech,
well
surely
it
can
be
--
it
will
be
prohibited.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
am
talking
about
the
tough
case
where
something
is
indecent
and
but
yet
may
be
protected
---
the
person
may
be
protected
from
criminal
prosecution
for
uttering
some
swear
words
or
something
like
that.
but
if
it's
in
the
indecent
category,
are
you
saying
it's
outside
of
the
non-censorship
category,
that's
what
i
--
how
do
you
measure
it
in
censorship?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
ultimate
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
federal
communications
commission
has
any
power
to
regulate
a
radio
broadcast
that
is
indecent,
but
not
obscene.
on
a
tuesday
afternoon,
in
october
of
1973,
the
respondent
pacifica
corporation
which
operates
a
radio
station
in
new
york
city,
broadcast
a
record
of
a
monologue
by
george
carlin
entitled
"filthy
words."
the
broadcast
was
heard
by
a
gentleman
riding
an
automobile
with
his
young
son
who
wrote
a
letter
of
complaint
to
the
commission,
complaining
that
contained
words
that
were
improper
for
public
broadcast
.the
commission
ultimately
decided
that
the
broadcast
was
indecent
because
it
contained
words
that
referred
to
excretory
and
sexual
activities
or
organs
and
such
words
were
indecent
and
the
commission
let
the
respondent
know
that
although
no
sanction
would
be
imposed
for
this
broadcast,
that
the
fact
that
such
a
broadcast
had
been
made
would
be
noted
in
it's
file
and
kept
available
for
future
reference
in
the
event
the
similar
broadcast
were
made
in
the
future
or
at
the
question
of
license
renewal
came
up.
the
radio
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
which
reversed.
in
three
different
opinions,
the
court
of
appeals
in
effect
held
that
the
regulation
--
that
the
announcement
of
the
commission
was
improper,
that
it
too
broadly
condemned
in
decent
language.
the
commission
asked
for
certiorari
in
this
court
and
we
granted
certiorari
to
review
the
case.
there
are
four
questions
that
the
court
decides.
the
first
is
whether
the
case
involves
a
review
of
the
general
rule
or
merely
a
determination
that
the
particular
broadcast
as
given
in
the
afternoon
to
an
audience
which
included
large
numbers
of
children
as
well
as
the
adult
audience
could
be
regulated
as
indecent
and
the
court
first
holds
that
the
focus
is
on
the
particular
broadcast
rather
than
a
general
rule.
secondly,
the
court
considers
whether
the
section
of
the
communications
act
which
prohibits
censorship
prohibited,
the
commission
from
reviewing
the
matter
and
the
court
holds
that
prohibition
which
was
enacted
as
part
of
the
same
statute
to
prohibit
the
use
of
indecent
profane
or
obscene
language
is
not
applicable
to
the
subsequent
review
of
program
contents
such
as
this.
and
there
is
no
dissent
within
the
court
on
that
proposition.
the
third
question
the
court
considers
is
whether
the
broadcast
is
indecent
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
when
it
does
not
appeal
to
the
prurient
interest
and
therefore
is
not
obscene.
and
on
this
issue
the
court
holds
by
majority
five
to
four
that
the
broadcast
was
indecent
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
justice
stewart
has
written
a
dissent
in
which
justice
brennan,
justice
marshall
and
justice
white
have
joined
taking
the
position
that
the
statute
does
not
prohibit
the
broadcast.
then
the
fourth
issue
is
whether
the
commission
has
whether
the
first
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution
precludes
the
commission
from
exercising
any
sort
of
censorship
or
regulatory
power
over
an
indecent
broadcast
of
this
kind.
on
this
issue
the
court
has
also
divided
five
members
the
court
hold
that
the
first
amendment
does
not
prohibit
the
exercise
of
this
kind
of
power
and
therefore
sustains
the
action
of
the
commission
in
asserting
its
regulatory
jurisdiction
over
this
kind
of
broadcast.
the
opinion
which
i
have
filed
although
joined
by
a
majority
on
the
first
three
issues
is
only
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
justice
rehnquist
on
this
issue.
mr.
justice
powell
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
joined
by
mr.
justice
blackmun
on
this
issue
and
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
he
notes
that
although
they
were
not
normally
reach
the
constitutional
issue,
that
he
feels
the
court
is
so
flagrantly
wrong
in
this
case
that
it
should
be
discussed
and
he
is
joined
by
mr.
justice
marshall.
