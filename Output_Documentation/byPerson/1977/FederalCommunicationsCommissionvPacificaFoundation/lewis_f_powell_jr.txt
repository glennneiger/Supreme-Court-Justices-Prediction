mr.
claiborne,
the
department
supported
a
commission
below,
did
it
not?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
interrupt
there?
i'm
sorry
to
keep
interrupting
but
i
noticed
those
words
in
the
caveat
at
the
end
of
your
brief,
and
i
wonder
really,
whether
you
think
that's
a
fair
characterization
of
the
commission
or
its
present
position.
the
commission
denies
it
hardly
in
its
reply
brief,
judge
leventhal
didn't
think
that
was
a
bad
characterization.
is
it
necessary
to
construe
what
the
commission
actually
held
so
sweepingly?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
claiborne,
in
view
of
the
standard
that
you
propose
on
the
last
page
of
your
brief
in
light
of
that
standard
what
would
your
position
be,
the
department's
position
be
with
respect
to
this
bad
program,
of
these
11
minutes
with
put
on
the
air
in
say
8
to
9
o'clock
on
saturday
morning
which
will
be
prime
time
for
all
small
children.

reference
for
sure
