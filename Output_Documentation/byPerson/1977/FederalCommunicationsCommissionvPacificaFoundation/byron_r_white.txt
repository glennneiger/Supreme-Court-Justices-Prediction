basically,
because
of
326?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
say
the
united
states
is
a
statutory
part?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
i
won't
feel
ignorance
by
asking
another
question,
another
collateral
question.
do
you
think
that
section
2348
is
limited
to
the
agencies
listed
in
2342?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
it
was
under
this
chapter,
what
about
the
national
labor
relations
board?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
does
it
get
into
the
court
of
appeals?
how
does
the
court
of
appeals
get
authority
to
review
--
if
it
isn't
under
this
chapter,
i
think
that
it
isn't
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
only
the
agencies
in
2342
since
1966
have
this
authority.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
is
listed.
justice
byron
r.
white
federal
maritime,
atomic
energy
commission,
interstate
commerce
commission,
the
secretary
of
agriculture,
federal
communications
commission,
i
think
those
are
the
only
ones.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
only
been
true
since
1966,
except
for
the
icc.
justice
byron
r.
white
thank
you,
i
am
sorry.
