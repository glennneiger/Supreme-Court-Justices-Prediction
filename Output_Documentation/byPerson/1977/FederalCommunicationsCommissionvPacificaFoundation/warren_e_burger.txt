chief
justice
warren
e.

we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
federal
communications
commission
against
the
pacifica
foundation.
mr.
marino
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
you
may
bear
in
mind
that
we
are
familiar
with
the
facts
of
the
case
and
get
direct
at
your
legal
argument
if
you
wish?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
referred
to
some
work
of
now
senator
hayakawa,
but
it's
not
cited
in
your
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
do
have
an
indirect
criminal
enforcement
authority?
can
you
bring
a
criminal
proceeding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
going
to
the
question
about
cb,
are
the
cb
people
licensed
in
some
way
that
they
get
a
license
of
some
sort?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
not
the
commission
at
least
have
arguably
some
other
remedy
against
the
whole
revelations
by
cancelling
his
license?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
as
you
do
with
the
bond
cancellation,
at
the
end
of
his
--
when
he
came
up
for
renewal,
this
kind
of
conduct
would
certainly
be
a
factor
to
be
considered
in
the
renewal
of
the
license,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
are
not
confined
to
that
statute
on
a
renewal
of
the
license,
are
you
by
any
means?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
same
conduct,
the
same
words
whether
they
were
ultimately
found
to
be
criminal
or
non-criminal
might
constitute
a
basis
for
not
renewing
a
license,
might
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
in
the
public
interest.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
while
it
could
not
be
a
criminal
conduct
for
a
licensee
to
have
one
sided
programs
on
racial
or
political
matters,
that
might
be
a
ground
for
refusing
to
renew
their
license
and
it's
clearly
held
up
to
now
by
the
courts
that
have
reached
it,
and
so
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
marino.
mr.
plotkin?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
didn't
get
your
characterization
of
the
station,
what
kind
of
a
station?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
think
that
leads
young
people
to
turn
off
the
program
or
is
that
a
general?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
that
intended
to
be
a
come
on
to
be
sure
that
they'll
listen.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
arguing
now,
that
this
has
literary
or
artistic
value?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
educational
in
your
view?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
there
at
10
o'clock
in
the
morning.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
arguments
in
the
federal
communications
commission
against
pacifica
foundation
mr.
claiborne
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
claiborne,
as
it
occurred
to
you
that
there
may
be
a
difference
between
relationship
with
the
department
of
justice
to
let
us
say
the
secretary
of
defense,
a
cabinet
officer
and
the
relationship
with
what
is
thought
of
as
an
independent
regulatory
agency,
which
is
not
subject
to
in
the
same
way
surely
to
the
direction
of
the
executive
branch.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
apart
from
these
background
procedural
matters
mr.
claiborne,
i
understand
this
is
--
the
station
that's
involved
here
is
a
public
--
part
of
the
public
radio
system.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
supported
by
the
congress,
by
funds
appropriated
by
congress?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
doesn't
take
commercial
advertising.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
claiborne,
our
collateral
inquiries
have
taken
some
of
your
time,
we
will
enlarge
your
time
five
minutes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
claiborne,
assume
that
this
station's
license
came
up
for
a
renewal
or
that
of
the
commercial
station
with
exactly
this
record
of
a
broadcast,
precisely
this,
and
the
coalition
of
churches,
civic
associations,
parent/teachers
organizations
intervened
under
the
united
church
of
christ
intervention
procedure,
would
you
think
on
this
record
if
the
commission
refused
to
renew
the
license
that
on
that
ground
and
solely
upon
the
ground
with
this
broadcast
it
is
being
antagonistic
to
the
public
interest,
that
that
could
be
--
that
should
be
sustained,
of
course.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
have
broad
discussion,
do
they
or
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
they
did
it
once
a
week
for
10
weeks
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
position
of
the
department
of
justice
that
under
section
1464,
anything
goes
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
left
out
one
part
of
the
statute,
haven't
you,
indecent?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
marino?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
i
suppose
one
citizen
can
call
the
attention
of
the
police
department
or
the
fire
department
to
a
nuisance
and
that
triggers
the
procedures.
is
that
your
suggestion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
perhaps
if
you
know,
could
you
clarify
what
i
put
in
the
question
to
mr.
claiborne,
is
this
station
itself
supported
by
appropriated
funds,
appropriated
by
the
congress,
or
it's
a
public
subscription?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
77-528,
federal
communications
commission
against
pacifica
foundation
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
stevens.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
stevens.
