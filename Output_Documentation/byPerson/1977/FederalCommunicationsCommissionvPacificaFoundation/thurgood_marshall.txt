justice
thurgood
marshall
and
of
course,
the
child
((inaudible)
knows
what
kind
of
station
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
i
say
the
average
child
knows
that
this
is
educational
station
which
has
a
broad
range
of
programs,
all
–
how
in
the
world
could
a
child
know
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
not
an
expert
but
if
that's
artistic
deliverably
–-
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
that
is
artistic
deliverably.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
difference
though
is
the
commission
has
authority
but
statute
to
come
in
like
the
icc.
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
the
same
right
as
icc.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
there
are
instances
where
the
icc
and
the
solicitor
general
have
been
at
odds
in
this
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
didn't
mean
by
that
that
was
a
nice
way
of
doing
business
or
running
revenue.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
was
it,
a
suggestion?
i
mean
it
wasn't
an
order
of
banning
it,
it
wasn't
defined.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
no
more
than
a
declaratory
order.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
also
thought
they
would
be
violating
the
censor
statute
too,
didn't
they,
if
they
did
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
didn't
you
consider
that
when
you
were
grabbed
in
this
order?
justice
thurgood
marshall
326?
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
community
we
have
mentioned,
all
i
have
heard,
argued
here
today
is
one
--
one
man
with
one
son,
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
community
action
in
one
way,
he
wasn't
the
man,
was
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
didn't
speak
for
the
community,
did
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
what
made
you
think
that?
you
only
got
one
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
need
the
communities
standing
in
your
case,
that's
what
i
want?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
he
is
the
one
citizen
then
give
him
the
right
to
say
he
is
pleading
for
the
community,
does
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
it's
not
the
community?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
am
i
correct
that
if
nobody
had
protested
you
wouldn't
have
taken
action?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
this
wasn't
a
fire.
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
it?
