justice
potter
stewart
that
isn't
--
you
are
now
talking
about
18
u.s.c.,
section
1464?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
really,
that's
the
issue
in
this
case,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes
i
understand
that
but
it's
the
meaning
of
section
1464
that's
at
issue
here
and
commission's
power?
justice
potter
stewart
under
the
statutes
that
incorporate
by
reference
that
criminal
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
all
right.
justice
potter
stewart
an
enforcement
proceeding
in
the
court
of
appeal
–
justice
potter
stewart
it's
different
from
the
--
technically
from
the
review
of
the
judgment
and
i
am
first
of
all
proceeding
under
the
labor
act.
justice
potter
stewart
if
this
would
not
include
anyone
or
more
of
the
words
used
in
a
hostile
manner
by
a
fictional
character,
assaulting
another
fictional
character
--
justice
potter
stewart
declaratory
order.
justice
potter
stewart
well
as
i
understand
it
the
solicitor
general
has
taken
the
position
that
this
particular
broadcast
was
protected
by
the
constitution,
i
thought
that
was
the
answer
in
response
to
a
question
by
my
brother
stevens.
justice
potter
stewart
so
even
so
limited
i
think
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
understand
the
–
their
position
differently?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right,
that's
quite
different
from
this
project.
