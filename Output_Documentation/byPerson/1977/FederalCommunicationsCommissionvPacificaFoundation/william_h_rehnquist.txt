justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
marino,
doesn't
the
commission
consider
any
number
of
factors
at
the
time
of
license
renewal
that
very
likely
the
government
couldn't
prosecute
a
station
for
criminally?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
doesn't
the
commission
justify
this
particular
rule
under
the
public
interest
standard
as
a
definition
of
the
public
interest
standard?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
almost.
[attempt
to
laughter]
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to
say
hell,
may
be
a
little
bit
of
an
over
statement,
may
it
not,
since
we
did
contire
--
and
confront
the
entire
section
by
section
of
the
statute
in
that
opinion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
words
are
there
in
the
opinion,
i
think
my
equivalent,
i
mean
the
equivalent
is
to
â€“
for
you
to
describe
it
as
a
holding
since
a
holding
is
presumably
the
application
of
the
law
to
the
particular
set
of
facts
before
the
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
now
you
said
the
question
was
reserved
in
red
lion
as
it
certainly
was,
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
in
the
case
of
regulated
air
waves
they
have
to
pass
the
same
test
as
they
would
if
they
sought
to
impose
this
test
on
a
newspaper
though?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
you
say
literally
the
fcc
can
never
tell,
any
station
that
it
may
not
put
out
any
particular
message?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
under
your
definition
of
censorship,
that
a
state
should
decide
that
for
an
hour,
it
would
put
on
a
record
consisting
of
one
four
letter
word
repeated
over
and
over
again,
for
the
hour.
no
one
would
make
any
claim
that
it
had
any
coherent
message,
the
person
spending
the
--
simply
liked
it
that
way.
under
your
definition,
would
the
fcc
be
powerless
because
of
the
censorship
statute
to
effectuate
that
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
claiborne,
what
business
is
it
of
the
executive
branch
of
the
united
states
to
take
a
position
in
a
case
like
this,
once
the
petition
for
certiorari
is
granted
to
review
an
unfavorable
decision
to
the
government
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
and
this
court
is
going
to
consider
it
on
the
merits.
what
interest
does
the
government
as
an
institutional
litigator
have
in
wanting
a
narrow
construction
of
a
statute
enacted
by
congress?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
this
court
upholds
the
fcc,
the
government
will
have
no
problem
prosecuting
cases
under
the
statute
because
it
will
be
given
a
fairly
broad
construction
i
would
take
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
do
you
think
the
government
is
ever
entitled
as
an
institutional
litigator
through
the
solicitor
general
to
assert
that
an
act
of
congress
is
unconstitutional?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
under
its
general
authority
that
it
relied
on
as
an
alternative
ground
to
the
statutory
ground,
you
would
still
say
that
there
is
not
constitutional
power
in
answer
to
justice
stevens'
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
i
understand
the
commission's
order
had
also
relied
upon
its
general
authority
such
as
it
was
outside
of
the
state.
