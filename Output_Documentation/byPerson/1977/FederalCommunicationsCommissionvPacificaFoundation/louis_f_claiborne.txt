mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
perhaps
it's
first
appropriate
if
i
state
as
accurately,
as
i
can,
the
government's
position
in
this
case.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
position
of
the
united
states,
the
department
of
justice
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
fcc
was
speaking
for
itself
as
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
meant
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
of
the
united
states,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
of
course
the
united
states
is
a
statutory
separate
party
and
is
therefore
a
respondent
in
this
court.
in
this
particular
case,
the
united
states
has
or
the
department
of
justice
has
a
separate
interest
because
it
has
an
independent
responsibility
to
enforce
this
statute
quite
separate
from
the
commission's
responsibility
to
enforce
the
same
statute
in
its
regulatory
field.
it
is
therefore
appropriate
it
seems
to
us
for
the
united
states
to
speak
the
views
of
the
department
of
justice
in
this
case,
since
it
must
be
bound
by
the
decision.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
government
that
is
the
solicitor
general
and
the
department
of
justice
take
the
view
that
they
should
not
press
for
broader
prosecutorial
discretion,
then
in
their
view
the
constitutional
reach
of
the
statute
would
authorize,
and
accordingly
it
seems
to
us
that
the
court
ought
to
have
the
benefit
of
reviews
of
the
department
of
justice
as
the
constitutional
reach
of
the
statute.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
there
may
be
rare
occasions
when
that
is
so.
this
is
not
such
an
occasion.
we
do
not
suggest
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
we
suggest
that
it
has
a
limited
application
and
that
the
commission
has
construed
it
beyond
that
constitutional
reach.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
indeed
mr.
justice
white,
i
have
cited
in
the
brief
the
provisions
of
both
the
communications
act
and
the
judicial
code
which
make
that
clear.
perhaps
the
clearest
provision
is
that,
in
the
judicial
code
and
one
finds
it
in
section
2342,
first
tells
us
that
all
in
paragraph
one
there,
that
all
final
orders
of
the
federal
communications
commission
made
reviewable
by
section
402(a)
of
title
47
all
covered
by
the
following
sections.
this
is
such
an
order
issued
by
the
commission
under
section
402
of
its
statute.
when
we
then
change
to
section
2344,
we
note
that
an
action
brought
in
the
court
of
appeal
to
review
such
an
order
is
to
be
an
action
against
the
united
states,
and
it
further
provides
at
the
end
of
that
provision
that
the
clerk
shall
serve
a
true
copy
of
the
petition
on
the
agency
and
on
the
attorney
general.
and
when
we
return
to
section
2348
of
title
28,
we
note
that
the
attorney
general
is
responsible
for
and
has
control
of
the
interests
of
the
government
in
all
court
proceedings
under
this
chapter.
the
agency
and
any
party
in
interest
may
appear
–
i
am
skipping
words
--
as
parties
thereto
of
their
own
motion
and
as
of
right,
primary
responsibility
of
the
attorney
general
but
independent
right
of
the
agency
to
be
represented.
hence
here,
the
commission,
though
not
joined
by
the
solicitor
general
was
authorized
to
file
a
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice
that
would
certainly
apply,
apply
with
greater
force
in
those
circumstances
where
the
agency
was
not
free
to
represent
itself
before
this
court,
and
where
therefore,
the
solicitor
general
would
feel
a
greater
inclination
to
support
the
independent
commission's
view,
which
could
otherwise
not
be
presented
to
the
court,
to
when
the
agency
has
an
independent
right
to
appear
here
that
considerations
perhaps
lessened.
this,
however,
is
an
unusual
case,
in
that
the
department
of
justice
has
a
quite
separate
responsibility
under
the
statute,
and
therefore
cannot
be
bound
or
overly
influenced
by
the
views
of
the
commission
as
it
applies
to
the
statute
in
a
different
field.
and
indeed
when
this
court
decided
the
abc
case
in
347
of
the
united
states
reports,
the
court
relied
on
the
construction
of
that
anti-lottery
statute
for
communications
act,
relied
on
the
construction
placed
on
that
statute
by
the
attorney
general
and
said
it
cannot
have
one
meaning
for
the
commission
and
another
for
the
department
of
justice.
we
notice
that
the
department
of
justice
does
not
view
these
programs
as
violating
that
statute,
and
we're
influenced
by
that
in
holding
that
the
commission
has
ever
stepped
the
line.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
and
indeed
the
federal
communications
commission
under
the
hobbs
act
in
this
sort
of
case.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
as
the
same
independent
right
and
indeed
it's
petition
which
this
court
granted
was
not
joined
by
the
solicitor
general,
nor
was
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
indeed
mr.
justice
marshall,
and
there
have
been
instances
in
which
the
federal
maritime
commission
and
the
united
states
have
been
in
odds,
and
in
the
most
recent
such
case,
the
court
upheld
the
views
of
the
united
states
rather
than
those
of
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
marshall,
of
course,
it
is
to
be
avoided
if
possible,
and
we
as
the
court
knows
have
joined
the
commission
in
some
of
its
submissions
before
this
court,
we
part
company
at
a
certain
point.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not
know
whether
the
federal
funds
are
involved,
but
certainly
it
uses
the
public
airways,
it
is
licensed
by
the
federal
communications
commission,
it
is
in
every
respect
like
a
commercial
radio
station,
except
only
that
it
is
owned
and
operated
by
non-profit
corporation.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
doesn't
take
commercial
advertising,
and
of
course,
it's
not
governed
by
the
profit
motive
and
for
that
reason,
may
not
be
censored
as
it
were
by
public
taste
to
the
same
extent
as
a
commercial
station,
may
not
be
influenced
by
the
reaction
of
a
commercial
public
who
might
view
such
material
as
it
is
involved
in
this
case
as
distasteful
and
accordingly
sponsors
would
not
sponsor
it
and
the
station
would
not
air
it.
that
consideration
doesn't
apply
with
respect
to
a
broadcaster
like
pacifica.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
powell,
that
is
true
and
that
is
an
embarrassment
to
us.
it's
right
to
say
that
the
matter
was
handled
there
by
the
anti-trust
division
rather
than
the
criminal
division.
when
the
matter
came
on
for
consideration
of
a
petition
for
certiorari
the
matter
was
handed
over
to
criminal
division
and
its
view
shared
by
the
solicitor
general
was
that
the
judgment
below
was
correct,
and
that
the
review
of
it
ought
not
to
be
sought
and
accordingly
we
did
not
petition,
we
did
not
oppose
a
petition
but
when
the
court
took
the
case,
we
deemed
it
arguably
to
give
this
court
the
benefit
of
our
views.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
am
most
thankful.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
that
is
so
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
my
understanding,
mr.
justice
white,
is
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
does
not
have
independent
authority
to
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
they
must
be
and
i
don't
have
it
to
hand,
a
provision
in
the
labor
relations
law.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
which
allows
the
–
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
exactly
so,
but
i
think
it's
clear
mr.
justice
white
that
when
it
comes
to
proceedings
in
this
court
by
petition
for
certiorari
or
otherwise,
the
labor
board
does
not
have
independent
authority
to
represent
itself.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
addition
the
icc.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yeah
--
well,
yes
the
federal
maritime
commission.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
those
are
the
only
ones
which
have
independent
authority
to
appear
on
their
own
in
this
court
at
least.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
may
be
so
mr.
justice
white,
i
don't
go
back
any
further.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
what
times
remains
it's
perhaps
useful
to
say
that
opposition
is
simply
this
that
we
construe
section
1464,
the
only
section
which
reviews
involved
in
this
case,
as
one
that
cannot
consistently
with
the
first
amendment
be
applied
so
as
to
ban
absolutely
for
any
substantial
period
of
time,
the
airing
of
particular
words
on
radio
or
television
wholly
without
regard
to
circumstances
or
to
the
context,
that
is
the
limit
of
opposition.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
powell,
i
fear
it
is.
judge
leventhal
sought
to
save
the
commission's
order
by
narrowing
it
and
the
commission
writes
its
code
tales.
but
the
order
which
is
what
is
before
the
court
and
not
their
counsel's
representation
of
it,
it's
very
clear
the
calling
dialogue
was
not
judged
except
only
insofar
as
it
contained
certain
words.
those
words
regardless
of
how
they
were
spoken,
regardless
of
the
manner
in
which
they
were
spoken,
regardless
of
the
surrounding
words
were
judged
by
the
commission
to
be
indecent
language.
the
definition
of
indecent
language
which
the
commission
gave
was
clearly
one
which
did
not
have
any
relation
to
the
context.
they
ruled
that
indecent
language
could
in
no
circumstances
except
perhaps
after
10
o'clock
in
the
evening
be
redeemed
by
its
context,
and
accordingly
we
see
no
option
but
to
say
the
commission
and
to
this
extent
that
to
be
commanded
on
their
clarity
of
the
order
has
said
straight
forwardly
these
words
in
no
circumstances
when
children
maybe
in
the
audience
and
so
far
as
we
can
determine
that
is
all
--
maybe
it
and
they
did
not
look
to
the
monolog
to
see
whether
in
that
context,
things
might
be
different.
they
said
these
words
repair
in
that
monolog
they
are
indecent
by
our
definition,
and
accordingly
that
may
not
be
done
again.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice
i
have
some
difficulty
with
the
question,
but
the
question
goes
beyond
the
boundaries
of
section
1464.
i
take
your
question
mr.
chief
justice
to
suggest
that
perhaps
under
a
public
interest
standard
the
commission
has
some
discretion
in
renewal
proceedings
and
perhaps
seen
in
judging.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
i
would
have
submitted
though
it
is
perhaps
beyond
the
responsibility
of
the
department
of
justice
to
what
speak
to
this,
but
i
would
have
submitted
that
the
commission
may
take
into
account
whether
the
station
has
devoted
a
very
substantial
portion
of
its
programming
to
a
kind
of
material
that
did
not
appeal
to
substantial
part
of
its
audience,
and
that
accordingly
it
was
not
in
the
public
interest
to
renew
that
license
when
other
applicants
who
served
more
of
what
the
general
public
wanted
were
there
waiting
to
take
the
spot,
but
i
would
not
think
it
is
permissible
for
the
commission
to
focus
on
a
isolated
instance
of
the
broadcast
of
this
monolog
and
say
that
bad
mark
will
justify
for
revoking
your
license
when
renewal
time
comes.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
know
where
the
line
is
drawn
but
i
do
recognize
that
the
commission
must
judge
between
applicants
and
must
be
concerned
that
the
station
to
whom
it
has
granted
license
does
effectively
serve
the
public
interest,
and
that
must
be
into
serving
instead
of
being
what
most
of
the
public
within
its
reach
prefer.
it
does
not
however
in
my
submission
allow
the
commission
through
the
backdoor
to
censor
a
particular
programs
by
saying
we
can't
forbid
it
but
we
can
take
it
into
account
in
failing
to
renew
your
license,
that
would
overstep
the
balance
of
section
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
no.
we,
as
we've
tried
to
explain
in
the
last
portion
of
our
brief
indicated
that
in
our
view
first
if
these
very
words
are
used
in
a
way
which
though
not
really
fighting
words
because
the
confrontation
is
not
face-to-face,
nevertheless
are
used
in
a
hostile
manner,
so
as
to
insult
the
audience
generally
or
anyone
in
particular,
they
maybe
reached
under
the
--
analysis.
we
go
further
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
indeed,
mr.
justice
stewart
and
to
that
extent
we
say
it
must
be
judged
in
context.
it
depends
on
the
circumstances
even
fighting
words,
it's
properly
so
defined,
cannot
be
judged
as
words,
the
words
fascist
and
racketeering
itselves
are
not
banned
and
simply
that
when
they
use
face-to-face
to
an
individual
in
without
disarming
smile
they
are
likely
to
provoke
a
breach
of
the
piece
and
accordingly
maybe
banned
as
fighting
words.
here
we
go
further
and
we
say
that
if
--
and
we're
concerned
here
primarily
about
citizen's
band
radio,
if
someone
ill-advised
attempted
to
jam
the
airways
by
the
use
of
four
letter
words
strung
indefinitely
we
say
that's
sort
of
spewing
force
of
indecent
language
with
no
conceivable
redeeming
purpose
could
be
reached
by
section
1464,
and
the
indecency
provision
of
it
because
it
would
not
qualify
as
obscenity
since
it
didn't
appeal
to
create
interest,
and
it's
for
that
reason
that
we
think
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice
i
meant
to
say
if
i
didn't
that
that
would
be
reached
under
the
indecency
portion
of
the
statute,
and
it
is
for
that
reason
that
we
think
it's
important
to
save
something
of
the
separate
as
we
view
it,
indecency
prohibition
in
the
statute
quite
separate
from
the
obscenity
prohibition
which
of
course
all
survives
under
the
militancy.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
powell,
if
it
could
be
shown
and
i
don't
know
that
it
could
that
that
was
a
time
peculiarly
devoted
to
children's
programming,
and
that
the
particular
program
in
which
it
was
included
was
one
aimed
specifically
at
children
we
would
as
we
say
in
our
brief
view
that
as
reachable
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
mr.
justice
powell,
i
think
we
say
that
in
the
last
paragraph
about
brief,
quite
independently
of
that
–
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
any
radio
broadcast
specifically
directed
at
younger
children
regardless
of
the
hour
might
at
least
we
think
genetively
be
reached
under
the
statute.
there
are
definitional
problems
about
what
a
program
aimed
specifically
at
children
would
be
and
there
we
would
seek
the
help
of
the
commission
in
defining
a
children's
program.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
stevens
that
would
be
our
conclusion.
we
haven't
addressed
particularly
what
the
arguable
redeeming
value
there
is
in
the
calling
monolog
because
it
seems
to
ask
that
the
commission's
order
does
not
address
it,
but
we
would
point
out
that
that
was
clearly
not
a
children's
program.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
first
mr.
justice
rehnquist
i
would
say
that
wasn't
statutory
power
because
of
the
anticensorship
provision
in
section
326.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
certainly
so
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
we
would
say
that
the
only
exception
to
any
censorship
provision
with
respect
to
banning
a
particular
program
is
what
was
originally
the
second
section,
the
second
sentence
of
that
same
section
that
is
section
1424
as
it
now
is,
and
therefore
anything
that's
reached
under
1464
can
be
viewed
as
an
exception
to
the
any
censorship
provision
but
the
public
interest
provisions
do
not
in
our
view
allow
the
commission
to
violate
the
any
censorship
provision
except
only
in
the
sense
that
if
programming
is
devoted
to
material
that
does
not
serve
the
public
interest
to
such
a
degree
that
maybe
taken
into
account
a
renewal
time,
but
not
a
bad.
i've
exhausted
my
time.
