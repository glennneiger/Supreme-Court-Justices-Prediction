mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
place
this
case
just
a
little
bit
into
proper
perspective
so
that
we
will
know
what
we're
talking
about
because
we
are
talking
about
a
criminal
statue.
this
case
very
briefly
involves
a
program
on
the
commercial
educational
station
in
new
york
with
a
limited
audience
which
was
a
discussion
program
that
was
involved
on
this
particular
day.
it's
a
regular
program
on
this
particular
day.
the
program
was
devoted
to
discussion
of
contemporary
attitude
with
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
it's
a
non-commercial
educational
station,
that
means
it's
a
station
licensed
for
a
non-profit
organization,
none
whose
activities
cane
be
--
there
can
be
no
commercials
on
it,
and
it's
programs
of
an
educational
nature,
it's
like
weta
here
in
washington,
here
the
same
type
of
station.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
if
it's
a
little
high
probably
i
would
describe
--
i
have
described
in
the
morphology
rather
than
the
function
i
think,
but
in
any
event
this
was
a
discussion
program
and
that
day
the
discussion
was
devoted
to
contemporary
language
and
as
part
of
the
program,
the
moderator
took
questions,
answered
questions
and
then
played
this
five
minute
segment
of
a
record
by
george
carlin
called
occupation
foole
and
the
particular
selection
was
filthy
words
and
it's
a
twelve
minute
dialogue.
before
the
dialogue
was
put
on
there
was
an
announcement
that
some
of
the
words
on
this
program
may
be
of
a
delicate
and
offensive
nature
and
those
who
might
be
offended
by
it,
might
tune
out
for
15
minutes
and
come
back
at
the
end
of
the
program.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
no,
it
might
be
an
invitation.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
it's
awfully
hard
to
know
both
in
advertising
and
in
general.
this
type
might
be
invitational
rather
than
the
contrary.
i
think
on
this
type
of
station
it
is
not
because
--
this
is
not
a
type
of
station
that's
devoted
to
commercial
enterprises.
this
was
not
a
pandering
program.
it's
not
a
titling
program,
it's
a
station
that
does
devote
itself
to
the
unusual
program,
to
the
highly
controversial
program,
to
a
wide
variety
of
programming.
and
while
on
other
stations
this
type
of
ad
might
be
a
come
on,
in
this
type
of
station
i
don't
think
this
is
the
intention,
but
i
don't
think
we're
dealing
with
subjective
matters,
i
think
we're
dealing
with
objective
matters.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
oh,
yes,
the
child
was
sitting
with
his
father
and
presumably
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
how
could
he
know
it
is
education?
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
this
particular
child,
we
know
very
little
about
him,
we
only
know
about
his
father
who
sent
in
a
complaint,
but
in
any
event
he
sends
in
a
complaint
and
pacifica
foundation
answered
that
this
was
the
work
of
social
((inaudible)
and
that
this
was
intended
to
have
a
discussion
of
the
whole
subject.
the
fcc
then
adopted
a
memorandum
opinion
and
order.
they
adopted
a
memorandum
opinion
and
order
as
part
of
an
overall
proceedings,
where
the
commissioner
responds
to
complaints
from
congress
and
pressure
from
other
groups
was
addressing
several
different
subjects;
violence,
sex
related
programs,
and
obscene
and
indecent
language,
and
very
interestingly
they
talked
at
great
length
about
violent
program
and
they
are
talking
about
television
as
well
as
radio.
they
are
talking
about
violent
program,
they
are
talking,
about
sexually
oriented
programs
and
very
interestingly
the
commission
says
that
while
they
may
be
social
harm
even
--
some
of
these
things,
that
nothing
we
can
do
about
it,
because
this
is
a
very
delicate
area
of
our
first
amendment
and
therefore
this
is
the
side
of
thing,
we
leave
to
the
station's
good
judgment,
to
their
editorial
discretionary
judgment,
but
when
it
comes
to
obscenity
or
indecency
it's
a
different
subject,
because
here
we
have
a
statute,
a
specific
criminal
statute,
18
u.s.c.,
1464
and
this
statute
says,
you
can
do
something
about
obscenity,
indecency
or
profanity
that
you
can't
do
with
respect
to
violence
or
sex
oriented
material
and
it's
important
to
look
at
the
statute.
the
statute
does,
is
not
part
of
the
communications
act,
but
it
does
forbid
the
utterance
of
indecent,
obscene
or
profane
language
over
radio,
whether
it's
radio,
television
cb
any
other
type
of
radio
communication
and
the
commission
is
given
specific
authority
to
enforce
it
either
by
revoking
a
license
by
issuing
a
cease
and
desist
order
or
by
levying
a
fine.
here
they
didn't
do
any
of
those
three
things.
here
they
issued
the
general
declaration
which
says,
that
we
find
that
these
types
of
words
particularly
when
children
are
likely
to
be
in
the
audience
are
indecent
because
they
refer
it
in
a
patently
offensive
manner
to
sexual
excretory
activities
or
organs
and
that
therefore
they
should
be
banned
during
that
period
and
that
they
cannot
be
redeemed
by
context
even
though
they
have
literary,
artistic
or
scientific
value,
they
are
banned
par
se.
they
do
want
to
say
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
in
the
overall
context
yes
it
was,
yes.
the
words
themselves
may
not,
but
in
the
overall
context,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
the
question
is
to
whether
it's
educational
or
not
was
not
involved
in
this
case.
as
to
whether
it
has
artistic,
literary,
scientific
value
yes.
even
mr.
commissioner
robinson
who
concurred
in
the
case
on
the
very
narrow
point,
said
that
if
he
had
to
judge
upon
whether
it
had
artistic,
literary
or
scientific
value
said,
he
would
come
down
and
say
that
it
did
have
it,
but
he
agreed
with
the
commissioner
that
you
don't
look
at
context
when
children
are
likely
to
be
in
the
audience.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
pardon?
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
well,
i
think
the
use
of
words
is
a
very
difficult
matter
and
obviously
some
people
use
words
in
some
connection,
other
people
use
them
in
other
connection.
i
do
want
to
address
myself
to
the
statue
because
we
are
talking
about
the
criminal
statute
and
1860
–
and
the
--
this
court
had
previously
held
when
the
commissioner
had
attempted
to
adopt
rules
and
regulations
related
to
a
lot
of
the
--
which
also
was
a
criminal
statute
where
the
commissioner
had
the
same
authority,
this
court
in
the
federal
communications
commission
against
abc
which
is
at
the
357
u.s.
specifically
held,
that
the
commission
cannot
interpret
the
words
of
a
criminal
statute
when
applying
it
in
it's
regulatory
aspect,
any
differently
than
a
court
would
and
this
court
specifically
overturned
rules
and
regulations
of
the
commission
which
attempted
to
define
consideration
for
the
purpose
of
a
lottery
as
being
different
from
what
it
was
in
a
criminal
law.
here
we
have
a
statute
that
uses
indecent,
obscene,
indecent
or
profane,
exactly
the
same
type
for
words
that
are
used
in
18
u.s.c.,
1461
which
has
been
before
this
court
in
the
hamling
case
and
this
court
has
specifically
held
that
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction,
that
when
those
words
are
used
and
the
word
indecent
filthy,
vile
and
obscene
must
mean
the
same
as
obscene
and
although
satisfy
the
dual
case
of
avoiding
vagueness
under
the
due
process
clause
and
must
as
a
whole
appeal
to
prurient
interest
and
must
be
without
any
literary,
artistic,
social
or
scientific
value.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
no
i
have
the
same
problem
as
my
predecessor
here,
since
you
wrote
the
opinion
your
honor,
but
you
see
we
now
hope
–
you
can
say
we
now
construe
it
as
to
avoid
the
problem.
i
think
that's
the
strongest
language
to
a
third
person
as
possible
to
say.
i'm
not
saying
that
no
other
conclusion
was
possible,
but
the
language,
is
very
strong
that
in
order
save
the
statute
it
was
so
construed.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
well,
i
think
that's
right
and
technically
that
was
1461
there
and
this
is
1464
but
the
words
in
the
statute
are
the
same,
the
medium
is
the
same.
we
have
a
first
amendment
medium
here,
just
as
we
do
there,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
not
only
do
we
have
a
first
amendment
medium
under
the
first
amendment,
for
section
326
of
the
communications
acts
specifically
says,
that
the
commission
shall
have
no
power
of
censorship.
now
this
is
an
entirely
different
thing
from
the
farness
doctrine
or
lack
of
balance
where
because
this
is
a
medium
where
scarcity
is
a
factor,
the
court
has
said,
that
in
order
to
make
sure
that
the
medium
is
made
available
to
a
maximum
number
of
people,
we
won't
pose
certain
duties
upon
broadcast
stations
to
make
sure
that
all
can
use
it.
but
that's
an
entirely
different
thing
from
the
government
coming
in
and
saying,
that
you
are
forbidden
to
do
something
and
in
the
red
lion
case,
which
mr.
justice
white
authored,
you
made
that
very
point,
whereas
the
fairness
doctrine
and
the
personal
tech
doctrine
might
be
sustained
because
it's
expanding
the
medium,
had
it's
real
caveats
and
entirely
different
question
would
be
presented
if
the
government
here
were
trying
to
suppress
speech
and
that's
exactly
what
they
are
doing
here,
they
are
trying
to
suppress
speech.
for
trying
to
suppress
speech,
they
must
be
able
to
past
the
same
test
here,
as
they
do
in
any
other
first
amendment
need.
the
fact
that
this
is
radio
does
not
make
a
difference.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
i
think
326
does
mean
that
your
honor.
i
think
not
only
the
first
amendment
but
i
think
congress
is
saying
that
in
section
326
when
it
says,
the
commission
shall
have
no
power
of
censorship.
when
it
comes
to
suppression,
i
think
the
same
test
is
applicable
to
radio
and
television
as
it
is
applicable
to
a
newspaper.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
i
say
that
they
cannot
tell
a
radio
or
television
station
that
they
cannot
suppress
what
a
radio
or
television
station
can
do
anymore
than
they
can,
any
other
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
i
think
now
that
ads
have
a
certain
amount
of
–
number
of
first
amendment
protections,
i
think
radio
and
television
ads
would
have
the
same
protection
as
newspaper
ads.
i'm
not
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
i
think
because
the
326
and
probably
because
of
the
first
amendment,
i
think
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
mr.
justice
tim
in
the
court
below
did
not
reach
the
constitution,
he
reached
326.
i
think
it
can
be
decided
on
326.
i'm
not
--
i
think
326,
as
first
amendment
over
toned,
but
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
do
it
because
the
congress
has
said
that
so
far
as
the
commission
is
concerned
when
it
comes
to
area
of
suppression,
they
cannot
suppress
this
anymore
than
any
other
medium
can
be
suppressed.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
i
think
that
would
be
powerless
to
tell
them
to
stop
doing
it.
i
would
have
the
same
problem
in
response
your
hypothetical
question,
if
a
station
did
nothing
to
say
but
played
the
musicals
round
and
round
all
day.
it's
not
because
of
the
content,
but
because
a
station
is
required
to
operate
in
the
public
interest
and
if
they
--
one
of
the
doctrines
that
the
commission
has
announced
in
the
--
if
you
don't
have
a
well
rounded
program
and
if
you
devote
too
much
of
your
programming
to
one
aspect
and
neglect
other
parts
of
your
programming,
you
are
not
operating
in
the
public
interest,
but
because
of
particular
words
are
bad,
not
because
particular
words
have
a
particular
taboo.
here
the
commission
is
saying,
that
just
because
you
use
these
seven
words,
no
matter
what
contents,
if
you
put
on
a
forum
where
people
came
in
and
discussed
a
live
subject,
a
controversial
issue,
and
some
of
the
people
came
from
the
time
the
culture
that
used
these
kinds
of
words
as
part
of
their
discussion
particularly
in
anger
and
heat,
the
commission
would
say,
that
if
you
did
that
during
the
afternoon,
that
this
would
be
a
violation
of
the
criminal
courts,
to
file
as
a
commission
you
can
see
it,
and
would
also
would
be
ground
for
revoking
our
lives.
i
don't
think
the
commission
has
that
authority.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
yes,
i
can
to
same
to
extent
that
i
can
justify
the
co-existence
of
1461
in
the
first
amendment,
if
it's
given
the
same
interpretation.
this
court
has
held
that
1464
is
no
different
than
1461.
if
it
is
constitutional
for
a
statute
to
say
that
obscene
material
cannot
be
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
yes,
but
i
don't
think
3
–-
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
i
think
326
have
to
be
read
in
the
same
light
as
the
first
amendment
when
they
said,
no
censorship.
they
said,
no
censorship
for
the
material
is
constitutionally
protected.
i
do
not
think
that
the
commission
by
326
has
less
power
than
the
government
does,
say
against
a
newspaper,
if
they
have
obscene
material,
if
you
can
prevent
obscene
material
under
1461.
