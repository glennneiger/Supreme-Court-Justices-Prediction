mr.
joseph
a.
marino
thank
you
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case
the
fcc
has
brought
this
case
to
you
for
review
and
from
the
judgment
of
the
court
below,
an
opinion
in
which
the
court
split
and
their
opinion
with
justice
leventhal,
that's
dissenting
in
the
hope
of
getting
some
clarification
to
the
meaning
of
the
word
“indecent”
as
appears
in
the
court
--
in
the
criminal
code
1464.
the
fcc
has
from
beginning
in
1970
tried
to
give
some
concrete
meaning
to
the
statute.
the
fcc
recognized
in
the
very
first
decision
in
1970
that
its
opinion
would
of
course
be
subject
to
the
judicial
review
and
it
welcomed
judicial
review.
this
case
came
to
the
fcc
on
a
specific
compliant
from
a
citizen
in
new
york.
the
case
as
it
now
is
before
the
court
really
raises
two
issues.
the
first
question
of
statutory
construction
is
whether
or
not
the
“indecent”
as
that
word
appears
in
1464
should
be
subsumed
into
the
obscene
as
it
has
been
in
several
other
federal
cases.
on
this
issue
both
the
fcc
and
the
department
of
justice
are
in
agreement
and
in
their
briefs
before
you
argue,
but
it
should
not
be.
the
department
of
justice
in
their
brief
makes
a
very
little
statutory
analysis
of
the
provision
of
1464.
it
points
out
that
the
language,
the
clear
language
that
congress
used
is
any
obscene,
indecent
or
profane,
but
this
language
was
used
in
the
disjunctive
that
congress
was
obviously
trying
to
reach
even
the
use
of
one
word
which
was
either
indecent,
obscene
or
profane
although
we
quickly
added
that
the
case
we
have
before
your
deals
not
was
obscenity
but
with
indecency
and
if
i
could
just
back
up
and
focus
on
the
complaint
that
the
commission
had
before
it.
that
complaint
was
filed
from
a
prior
listener
in
new
york,
a
specific
complaint
which
identified
four
words.
those
words
would
be
defined
as
verbal
taboos
and
in
fact
professor
holland,
his
text
book
and
language
and
sought
an
action
identifies
them
as
verbal
taboos
and
says
that
this
usually
deals
with
words
having
something
to
do
with
sexual
or
excretory
organs.
and
the
words
are
amount
in
one
judge
has
described
them
as
verbal
slaps.
so
this
specific
complaint
came
to
the
commission.
it
came
to
the
commission
at
a
time
shortly
after
this
court's
opinion
in
miller.
it
came
to
the
commission
shortly
after
that
the
dc
circuit
had
affirmed
its
opinion
in
the
illinois
citizen
case
dealing
with
the
question
of
obscenity
and
had
recognized
that
the
presence
of
children
in
the
audience
was
a
vital
factor
and
this
really
was
at
the
at
the
heart
of
the
commission's
decision
and
it
was
at
the
heart
of
the
complaint
that
the
commission
had
before
it.
the
listener
pointed
out
that
the
words
were
broadcast
at
a
time
in
the
afternoon
when
a
child
could
have
been
tuning
the
dial
and
would
have
come
across
those
words,
the
listener
pointed
out
that
in
fact
he
had
a
child
with
him
in
the
car.
and
this
really
was
we
think
at
the
heart
of
the
commission's
decision
when
it
came
to
the
concept
of
indecency.
the
commission
as
the
justice
department
correctly
recognizes
and
points
out
took
element
d
of
the
miller
case
patently
offensive,
tried
to
give
flesh
to
that
element
in
a
case
where
you
are
merely
dealing
with
words,
and
individual
words,
and
what
it
said
is
that
we
are
dealing
with
when
we
construe
the
“indecent”
is
words
which
are
patently
offensive
by
contemporary
community
standards
for
the
broadcast
media
which
deal
with
sexual
and
excretory
organs
which
are
broadcast
at
a
time
of
the
day
when
there
is
a
reasonable
risk
that
children
maybe
in
the
audience
and
this
is
where
the
commission
took
a
new
tack
we
believe
and
i
think
judge
leventhal
recognized
this
with
regard
to
the
place
and
with
the
indecency
standard,
it
tried
to
channel
these
words
out
of
time
periods
when
there
would
be
a
reasonable
risk
of
children
being
in
the
audience.
the
case
was
appealed
over
the
dc
circuit
which
split.
we
in
our
brief
have
called
to
your
attention
the
opinion
of
judge
leventhal.
we
think
that
that
opinion
correctly
construes
the
commission's
order.
as
a
narrow
order,
a
declaratory
order
limited
to
the
facts
that
the
commission
had
before
it,
that
the
complainant
had
brought
to
the
commission
that
many,
that
the
order
that
was
presented
to
the
court
as
a
flat
band
on
these
words
that
these
words
could
not
be
broadcasted
and
it
really
a
different
times
of
the
day
but
that
the
only
--
that
when
it
ruled
on
the
complaint
on
itself,
the
commission
narrowed
it
to
a
link
to
the
facts
that
it
had
before
it.
it
tried
to
accomplish
two
things
with
the
declaratory
order.
it
tried
to
furnish
a
concrete
definition
of
the
world
indecency
and
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
the
justice
department
had
told
the
court
that
the
commission
could
have
read
the
“indecent”
probation
in
the
criminal
statute
as
a
flat
band.
the
commission
did
not
do
so.
it
then
proceeded
to
analyze
the
complaint
and
the
conflicting
interest
that
--
and
competing
interest
that
words
take
here
and
central
to
those
interests
your
honor
was
the
recognition
that
this
court
made
in
the
yoder
case
that
the
parental
interest
in
the
upbringing
of
children
is
an
important
value.
that
opinion
the
commission
found
very
helpful
because
of
the
fact
that
in
the
yoder
this
court
not
relied
in
that
interest
but
also
relied
on
the
ginsberg
opinion
where
mr.
justice
brennan
had
recognized
this
as
similar
interest.
the
yoder
opinion
was
also
instructive
because
it
relied
on
at
least
cf.
the
rowan
case
in
which
this
court
recognized
that
in
the
certain
circumstances
people
are
captives
in
their
own
homes
and
that
at
that
point
they
are
entitled
to
privacy
interest.
now
the
commission's
opinion
really
at
the
heart
of
the
case
was
the
attempt
to
protect
children
from
these
words,
the
commission
also
tried
to
give
some
recognition
to
privacy
rights
of
people
on
their
home
who
would
tune
into
a
station
and
be
confronted
with
these
words.
we
would
point
out
that
in
a
cbs
versus
dnc
case
this
court
recognized
that
a
radio
listener
is
sort
of
–
is
in
many
ways
the
member
of
a
captive
audience
and
i
think
we
have
made
our
points
your
honor.
if
there
are
not
further
questions,
i
would
save
some
time
for
rebuttal
and
be
very
happy
to
answer
any
questions.
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
i
apologize,
your
honor.
the
text
that
i
refer,
it
is
his
text,
professor
hayakawa's
text
on
language
inside
an
action.
there
are
two
editions,
there
is
at
least
i
know
of
two
editions,
the
1949
edition
is
really
interesting
because
it
recognizes
not
only
the
verbal
taboos
that
before
you
are
dealing
with
sexual
or
excretory
organs,
but
goes
onto
point
out
that
at
least
at
time
in
broadcasting
over
many
more
taboos
that
made
it
very
hard
for
people
to
communicate
but
in
the
70
edition,
he
drops
the
reference
to
special
taboos
applicable
to
radio
and
identifies
the
ones
that
we
think
of
before
you.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
--
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
yes,
your
honor.
we
–-
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
your
honor,
the
commission's
definition
and
this
declaratory
order
addressed
to
the
breakfast
medium
which
is
different
from
the
cb
--
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
your
honor,
we
have
a
problem
here
that
the
department
of
justice
looks
at
that
statute
with
criminal
enforcement
in
mind.
the
commission
looks
at
the
statute
with
similar
enforcement
in
mind
and
with
an
attempt
to
channel.
i
think
that
once
the
commission
has
adopted
this
concept
of
channeling
at
least
in
broadcasting,
it
really
has
to
be
in
egregious
case
before
it
would
arise
from
the
point
--
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
your
honor,
i
think
that
if
we
are
looking
at
this
as
a
criminal
statute
and
not
--
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
we
think
that
it
would
violate
the
commission's
construction
of
the
statue,
yes.
however,
--
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
i
don't
think
we
have
a
position
on
that
your
honor
and
i
think
we
would
--
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
if
one,
if
it's
for
purposes
of
regulatory
action
in
one
case
and
channeling
the
words
into
a
different
time
period
and
in
another
case
really
--
the
reason
why
i
hesitate
on
the
crime
is
because
that's
really
a
question
that
we
would
defer
to
the
justice
department.
if
we
brought
a
complaint
to
them
and
they
said
this
doesn't
constitute
an
offense
that
would
be
the
end
of
it.
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
no,
we
have
to
refer
to
the
--
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
they
do
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
yes,
your
honor,
we
have
administrator
of
regulatory
actions.
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
yes,
your
honor
under
the
public
interest
standard
it
would
have
to
be
not,
one
violation
might
not
rise
to
the
level
of
justifying
some
action
at
renewal
but
yes
it
would.
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
your
honor,
the
commission
has
been
given
at
least,
there
are
at
least
3
sections
in
the
communications
act,
they
are
all
--
in
which
congress
has
asked
the
commission
to
enforce
1464
by
administrative
actions
and
it
feels
that
in
a
situation
where
we
are
reaching
a
type,
at
least
words
that
since
there
was
the
prohibition,
the
indecency
prohibition
that
was
the
way
to
reach
and
try
to
give
us
some
concrete
meaning.
in
response
to
justice
stevens'
question,
we
do
refer
cases
to
the
justice
department
for
fast
fusion
of
cb
operators
and
i
think
that's
really
the
only
--
that's
the
only
area
that
i
know
of
in
which
there
have
been
any
recent
convictions
for
violating
1464.
i
think
there
were
two
cases
arising
in
the
seventh
circuit,
on
which
i
know
you
were
on
those
panels
where
those
prosecutions
were
appealed.
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
as
justice
stevens
has
pointed
out,
we
have
not
only
be
in
the
decency
prohibition
--
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
i
guess
we
rely
on
more
of
a
criminal
statue.
we
rely
on
the
criminal
--
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
i
don't
think
we
could
because
congress
wrote
the
word
and
all
we
are
trying
to
do
your
honor
is
give
some
limiting
construction
to
it.
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
we
are
not
your
honor.
we
have
the
public
interest
standard,
you
are
absolutely
correct.
the
commission
theory
--
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
the
public
interest
standard
would
have
to
be
--
the
commission
would
have
to
make
as
you
pointed
out
in
united
church
of
christ,
the
commission
has
to
make
a
positive
finding
of
renewal
of
this
application
is
in
the
public
interest
–-
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
and
that
finding
could
not
be
made
in
a
situation
where
there
is
--
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
so
that
the
commission
could
have
reached
it
under
the
public
interest
standard
and
i
think
it
did
rely
on
the
public
interest
standard
in
encouraging
the
wider
use
of
radio
and
the
pubic
interest
but
it
felt
that
since
that
specific
probation
has
been
in
the
statute
and
we
tried
to
give
some
concrete
meaning
to
within
and
limit
it
as
much
as
possible
in
the
light
of
this
court's
opinions
in
the
person
and
--
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
it's
18
u.s.c.,
1464,
but
it's
also
in
the
context
of
communications
act
as
i
--
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
yes
as
the
commission
can
use
it
for
regulatory
--
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
yes
as
it
uses
that
prohibition
for
regulatory
activities.
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
just
two
small
points,
your
honor,
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday
in
this
argument
mr.
plotkin
in
this
morning
in
his
argument,
mr.
clairborne,
keep
referring
to
the
commission's
order
as
banning,
banning,
suppressing.
we
thought
the
commission's
order
makes
it
very
clear
that
it
wasn't
banning,
it
wasn't
adopting
a
flat
ban
that
it
was
trying
to
channel
this
material
to
periods
when
there
wouldn't
be
a
reasonable
risk
that
children
would
be
exposed
to
it.
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
no,
it
was
a
declaratory
order.
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
and
what
happened
is
that
we
had
almost
--
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
absolutely,
your
honor
it
was
the
suggestion
that
the
chief
justice
made
his
analogy,
a
citizen
came
into
the
commission
and
said
these
words
have
been
broadcast,
take
the
station's
license
entirely
away
from
them
because
they
have
abused
public
airwaves.
the
commission
thought
that
that
would
not
be
fair
to
even
put
them
in
hearing
on
that
question.
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
326,
your
honor,
prevents
--
326
was
written
in
the
communications
act
and
it
has
two
limitations
on
it,
number
one
the
commission
cannot
censor.
this
section
was
written
in
1927
and
at
a
time
when
everybody
had
blackstone.
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
we
did,
we're
certainly
aware
–
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
yes,
yes,
your
honor,
we're
certainly
aware
of
326,
we're
also
aware
of
the
language
that
mr.
justice
white
put
in
the
red
lion
case
about
the
commission
suppressing
or
preventing
people
from
broadcasting
what
they
want
to
broadcast.
we're
aware
of
326.
we're
aware
that
we're
not
in
a
position,
for
example,
of
a
motion
picture
censoring
board
which
can
say
to
a
broadcast
there
--
or
not
to
a
broadcast,
to
a
film
distributor,
bring
in
your
product
so
we
can
look
at
it.
we
can't
censor.
we
cannot
interfere
with
the
right
of
free
speech
by
means
of
radio
communication
because
that's
also
included
in
326.
but
we
would
add
that
when
congress
wrote
326
it
quickly
added
at
the
end
of
it
that
it
will
be
unlawful
to
use
any
obscene,
indecent
or
profane
language
by
means
of
radio
communications.
that
was
written
in
by
the
same
people
who
wrote
the
section
in
1927.
and
so
when
we
approach
these
cases
we
have
congress'
indication
in
326
itself
that
we
should
concern
ourselves.
we
not
only
have
that
indication
in
326,
we
have
it
in
at
least
three
other
sections
that
were
supposed
to
be
concerned
and
enforced
to
the
limited
extent
that
we
can
using
our
regulatory
powers.
i
want
to
respond
again
if
i
can
to
judge
--
justice
steven's
question
of
yesterday.
this
declaratory
order,
your
honor,
was
aimed
only
at
broadcasting
which
is
a
medium,
and
when
we
say
broadcasting,
and
i
think
everybody
recognizes
this,
we
are
talking
about
television,
am
and
fm
radio.
it
did
not
address
the
question
of
cb
which
is
a
different
medium,
raises
different
problems.
so
that
the
declaratory
order
was
aimed
only
to
broadcasting
and
i
think
there
is
no
doubt
about
that
in
the
order.
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
i
don't
think
so.
first
of
all,
let
me
back
up
and
say,
it's
not
if
the
commission
regards
it
that
way,
your
honor
–
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
no,
what
i
wanted
to
say
is
that
it's
very
clear
from
the
very
beginning
of
radio
communications
law
that
it's
really
a
question
that
turns
on
the
community
in
which
the
station
is
located.
so
if
those
words
are
found
to
be
patently
offensive
by
contemporary
community
standards
in
that
community
and
this
is
--
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
when
you
have
the
hard
--
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
well
by
censorship
i
think
326
takes
the
classical
censorship
which
was
prior
restrained,
a
motion
picture
censoring
board
which
--
and
i
think
this
was
--
let's
bear
in
mind
that
the
section
was
written
in
1927.
there
had
been
very
few
supreme
court
cases
and
everybody's
concepts
of
what
the
first
amendment
meant
were
the
blackstonian
concepts.
that
first
of
all
you
cannot
–
that
the
first
amendment
means
that
you
can't
censor.
subsequently
this
court
has
said
that
in
a
limited
category
you
can
--
motion
picture
censoring
board
may
censor,
but
that's
--
we
know
that
we
cannot
censor.
the
problem
is
that
broadcasters
have
additional
responsibilities.
broadcasters
have
to
broadcast
in
the
public
interest,
and
i
think
that's
the
other
side
of
the
equation.
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
we
only
received
one
complaint,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
we
certainly
did,
your
honor;
he
came
in,
in
a
representative
capacity,
we
think
rather
we
have
been
--
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
your
honor,
the
standing
--
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
one
citizen
can
raise
legitimate
public
interest
--
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
we
have
--
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
we
have
loosened
the
--
especially
in
these
informal
complaint
cases,
your
honor,
we
have
loosened
the
standards
to
such
an
extent
that
we
will
entertain
complaints
from
one
citizen
on
behalf
of
this
community.
we
have
learnt
our
lesson.
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
he
prefers
to
speak
for
his
community
to
the
extent
that
he
raises
a
public
interest
question
or
some
other
question.
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
we
wouldn't
have
known
about
it,
your
honor,
because
we
don't
--
we
just
don't
have
the
funds
or
we
don't
have
even
instructions
to
monitor.
so
we
would
have
never
known
about
it
except
the
citizens
bringing
this
to
our
attention.
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
that's
the
theory
and
mr.
justice
white's
opinion
in
the
new
york
telephone
company
case
--
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
no,
no
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
no,
it
wasn't,
your
honor,
but
i
gave
the
commission
an
opportunity
to
give
broadcasters
some
guidance,
and
it
did
it
in
the
context
of
a
concrete
factual
situation.
i
want
to
once
again
stress
and
i
don't
understand
why
the
united
states
feels
that
they
have
to
expand
the
commission's
order
to
reach
constitutional
questions,
when
it
could
have
been
read
very
narrowly
as
it
was
by
judge
leventhal
and
as
it
was
by
the
commissioners
who
instructed
us
to
come
and
seek
cert
before
this
court
on
the
basis
of
judge
leventhal's
opinion
knowing
that
we
were
going
to
rely
in
that
opinion.
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
i
don't
think
--
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
then
they
are
saying
that
it
couldn't
even
be
channeled.
they
would
channel
--
i
think
what
it
comes
down
to
--
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
they
still
would
say
that
you
channelized
--
i
think
they
said
you
channeled
in
response
to
mr.
justice
powell
that
you
channel
it
out
of
let's
say
captain
kangaroo
where
you
know
he
is
going
to
give
to
children,
i
can't
believe
that
--
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
but
what
we
are
saying
is
that
they
are
all
--
that
there
is
a
reasonable
risk
of
all
this
reaching
children
so
it's
a
question
of
which
is
--
under
the
public
interest
standard,
which
is
the
more,
the
better
channeling
device.
and
finally
in
conclusion
your
honor,
if
i
may,
i
think
we
may
have
inadvertently
slighted
the
alternative
theory
that
the
commission
use
in
its
order.
it's
contained
at
page
18
of
the
joint
appendix
and
we
would
also
rely
on
that
and
rest
on
that
in
submitting
this
case
to
you
and
asking
you
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
below.
mr.
joseph
a.
marino
it's
a
noncommercial
educational
station.
i
know
that
going
through
their
license
file,
there
is
at
least
one
indication
that
perhaps
they
were
asking
hew
for
funds
to
improve
their
facilities.
but
i
don't
think
it's
the
traditional
educational
or
pbs,
if
that's
the
correct
term,
station,
which
is
purely
educational.
i
think
they
are
non-commercial
and
they
therefore
qualify
for
educational
frequencies,
but
i
don't
think
they
are
a
government-supported
station
other
than
perhaps
the
subsidy
from
hew
that
they
have
got.
thank
you,
your
honor.
