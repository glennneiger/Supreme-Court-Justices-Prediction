of
march
25.
unknown
speaker
that
is
where
he
used
the
word
'enacted'
unknown
speaker
do
we
have
it
in
print
here
at
all?
unknown
speaker
we
would
not
suggest
for
a
moment
in
the
course
of
this
case
that
whatever
stage
it
was
that
the
city,
let
us
assume
that
the
city
council
of
dallas
had
the
power
in
its
charter
to
pass
a
new
ordinance,
it
just
simply
passed
a
new
ordinance
and
the
old
ordinance
that
the
court
was
considering
just
was
not
there
anymore.
the
ordinance
would
either
go
into
effect,
it
would
not
going
into
effect
unless
it
was
enjoined
and
found
unconstitutional,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
i
know
you
say
it
is
not
the
facts
--
unknown
speaker
but
then
you
would
have
to
submit
that
ordinance
to
the
court
and
that
ordinance
would
have
to
be
found
unconstitutional
before
it
could
be
enjoined
and
i
understand
the
fifth
circuit
in
this
case
says
that
this
ordinance
is
not
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
the
district
court
certainly
did,
did
it
not?
unknown
speaker
i
think
there
was
no
unconstitutional
impact
whatsoever
under
this.
unknown
speaker
exactly,
and
the
city
came
along
and
passed
a
new
ordinance.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
i
think
it
is
very
fair.
unknown
speaker
and
then
did
it
not
come
back
here
again?
unknown
speaker
suppose
we
do
not
agree
with
you
that
it
is
a
court
order
plan?
suppose
we
view
the
resolution
as
such
as
a
legislative
plan?
would
it
now
require
section
5
clearance?
unknown
speaker
it
would,
even
though
it
became
such
before
texas
became
a
covered
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
what
authority
is
the
reason
for
that?
unknown
speaker
then
is
it
your
submission
that
if
this
is
a
legislative
and
not
a
court
ordered
plan,
nevertheless
there
has
to
be
an
affirmance
because
there
has
not
been
a
pre-clearance?
unknown
speaker
anywhere
in
texas,
locally,
statewide,
any
change
in
the
great
state
of
texas,
you
are
supposed
to
bundle
them
up
in
a
bushel
basket
and
take
them
all
to
the
attorney
general?
unknown
speaker
and
did
they
do
that?
unknown
speaker
any
of
them.
does
the
attorney
general
attempted
to
find
out
if
they
ever
did
it
or
you
just
wait
for
complaints?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
very
good.
let
me
see,
like
in
perkins,
i
think
the
court
held
even
a
change
of
location
of
ballots,
of
polling
places
required
pre-clearance.
unknown
speaker
do
you
not
suppose
since
1972,
there
have
been
changes
of
polling
places
in
the
state
of
texas?
unknown
speaker
but
perhaps
elections
based
on
the
changes
in
the
polling
places
may
now
be
challenged
because
of
failure
to
get
a
pre-clearance?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
buscenmi,
why
did
you
not
answer
the
chief
justice
'yes'?
merely
from
that
fact
that
it
was
april
1976
after
the
1975
coverage
that
the
ordinance
finally
became
legal
when
it
was
approved
into
referendum
and
did
not
become
effective
until
then.
then
certainly
why
can
you
not
answer
the
chief
justice
of
course
the
eight/three
plan
has
to
have
pre-clearance
under
section
5?
unknown
speaker
will
you
address
this
question
of
pre-clearance
particularly
in
light
of
the
referendum
in
april
1976
after
texas
was
brought
under
the
section?
unknown
speaker
except,
mr.
werner,
i
take
it,
you
cannot
have
it
both
ways.
if
this
is
a
court
ordered
plan
for
the
purposes
of
section
5
then
it
ought
to
be
a
court
ordered
plan
for
purposes
of
--
unknown
speaker
well,
i
have
to
say,
mr.
werner,
our
cases
have
not
given
much
weight
to
that
congressional
intent
as
you
limit
it
in
perkins
and
all
the
others.
we
have
to
go
back
on
an
awful
lot
of
things
we
said
before.
unknown
speaker
mr.
werner,
when
is
your
next
municipal
election?
unknown
speaker
but
still
some
time,
if
you
had
to
go
through
clearance.
