justice
potter
stewart
was
that
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
not
the
fifteenth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
grounds
for
the
court's
decision
was
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
in
so
far
as
the
dallas
electoral
system,
discriminated
racially,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
no
finding
of
any
violations
of
reynolds
v.
sims
in
any
of
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
not
a
fifteenth
amendment
decision?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
are
not
really
released
and
this
case
does
not
involve
that
issue,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
resolution
expressing
an
intent.
justice
potter
stewart
he
interpreted
it
as
an
official
expression
of
the
court.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
after
this
decree
it
was
followed
by
an
ordinance,
and
that
in
turn
was
followed
by
a
charter
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
by
this
time
there
was
an
ordinance?
justice
potter
stewart
you
do
not
mean
the
common
law
of
voting
rights,
do
you?
you
mean
the
appropriate
equitable
remedy
for
violation
of
the
constitution?
justice
potter
stewart
i
would
adopt
it
if
i
were
you,
it
is
not
--
you
do
not
find
it
in
our
cases,
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
so
we
are
talking
the
precedents
to
which
you
refer
and
upon
which
you
rely,
have
to
do
what
is
appropriate
and
an
equitable
remedy
to
repair
a
constitutional
violation
and
the
cases
to
which
you
refer
all
involve
violations
of
the
doctrine
of
reynolds
v.
sims
not
a
single
one
of
them
that
i
know
of
involved
a
violation
of
such
as
was
found
here
which
we
do
not
have
before
us,
and
therefore,
we
cannot
assess
as
to
even
whether
or
not
it
was
a
constitutional
violation,
but
there
is
no
claim
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
so
called
one
person,
one
vote?
justice
potter
stewart
and
indeed
all
the
cases
to
which
you
refer,
none
of
them
with
which
i
am
familiar
and
you
are
free
to
correct
me,
i
may
be
wrong,
i
often
am,
have
to
do
with
at-large
municipal
elections
of
councilmen
and
there
has
been
a
presumption
in
this
case
that
multi...member
districts
to
a
state
legislature
are
somehow
the
exact
equivalent
of
at-large
elections
in
a
municipality
to
the
city
government
and
they
are
quite
two
different
animals.
justice
potter
stewart
it
did
involve
a
school
district
but
it
did
not
involve
a
home
rule
municipality,
did
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
i
am
talking
about
the
constitutional
test
here
and
the
remedy
for
asserted
constitutional
violation.
this
violation
was
not
a
reynolds
v.
sims
violation
and
we
are
not
talking
here
about
multi
member
districts
to
state
legislatures.
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
assuredly
that
is
a
given
in
this
case,
but
in
assessing
this
plan
do
we
not
again
have
to
look
and
see
whether
an
at-large
election
is
unconstitutional,
is
it
not
the
least
the
threshold
inquiry?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
but
district
court
did,
you
are
here
now.
but
you
are
here
now
and
if
there
is
nothing
at
all
unconstitutional
about
at-large
elections
in
a
municipality
of
the
governing
body
of
the
city,
that
is
the
end
of
this
case,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
a
threshold
issue
here.
justice
potter
stewart
they
certainly
raised
it
to
the
extent
that
they
say
that
the
at-large
election
of
three
members
of
the
city
council
is
not
unconstitutional?
justice
potter
stewart
has
this
court
ever
held
that
an
at-large
election,
within
a
jurisdiction
is
unconstitutional,
be
it
city
or
state?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
multi
member
districts
for
a
state
legislative
body?
justice
potter
stewart
we
remanded
it
for
consideration.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
extent
of
its
--
justice
potter
stewart
as
this
one
did
not.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
is
always
true
when
you
have
an
election
by
majority
rule.
if
municipality
is
55%
democratic,
the
votes
of
the
republicans
are
going
to
be
canceled
out
in
at-large
election.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
not
think
there
is
a
difference,
at
least
from
the
point
of
view
of
political
structure
and
political
science
between
a
board
of
county
commissioners
or
a
county
jury
or
whatever
it
may
be
called
in
various
states,
the
school
board
on
the
same
side
on
the
one
hand,
and
a
small
city
council
elected
at-large
with
the
city
manager
system
in
a
home
rule
municipality
on
the
other?
justice
potter
stewart
and
why
should
the
same,
if
there
is
a
difference,
why
should
the
same
constitutional
rule,
at
least
why
should
it
automatically
be
transferred
from
one
to
the
other?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
at
least
at
the
threshold,
it
involves
whether
at-large
municipal
elections
are,
if
there
is
any
defect
in
them
at
all,
does
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
the
district
court
found
so.
justice
potter
stewart
electing
eleven
of
them
at-large,
now
whether
or
not
that
is
right
or
wrong
is
not
now
before
us,
as
i
understand
it,
but
certainly
that
at
the
threshold
there
is
before
us
the
question
of
whether
the
election
of
three
members
of
the
council,
including
the
mayor
at-large
is
defective
in
any
respect?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
it
is
undesirable,
as
a
matter
of
view
of
a
remedy,
is
that
not
the
threshold
consideration?
justice
potter
stewart
and
never
said
so
with
respect
to
a
city
managed
municipality,
never,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
or
in
any
context,
has
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
is
not
a
city
manager
municipality,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
anywhere
in
texas?
justice
potter
stewart
or
alternatively,
the
approval
of
the
attorney
general
in
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
quite
possible,
i
suppose,
you
are
telling
us,
that
a
plan
approved
by
court
can
be
permissible
as
a
plan
that
has
been
initiated
by
a
legislative
body,
even
though
the
initiation
by
the
legislative
body
does
not
amount
to
legislation
as
such,
and
that
even
therefore,
if
it
is
not
a
court
devised
plan
and
can
permissibly
be
something
other
than
what
a
purely
court
devised
plan
could
be,
nonetheless,
it
is
a
court
approved
plan,
and
therefore,
might
immunize
it
from
the
necessity
of
submission
under
section
5,
if
later,
and
adopted
by
way
of
a
charter
amendment
which
is
a
must?
justice
potter
stewart
even
though
it
might
not
be
a
court
ordered
plan
for
the
purposes
of
our
previous
decisions
with
respect
to
multi
member
district,
since
the
initiative
came
a
legislative
body?
justice
potter
stewart
inviting
except
a
very
comfortable
position
for
you.
justice
potter
stewart
my
question
suggested
that
you
could
have
it
both
ways.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
surely
is
not
going
before
us
in
this
case.
it
is
surely
not
an
issue
in
this
case,
is
it?
