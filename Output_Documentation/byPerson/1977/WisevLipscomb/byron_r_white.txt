justice
byron
r.
white
except
by
a
resolution?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
city
council
did
it
though,
did
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
just
was
not
in
the
form
of
an
ordinance?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
if
that
had
been
an
ordinance,
it
might
as
well
have
been
an
ordinance?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
that
is
what
the
city
council
was
proposing?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
clear
enough.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
might
just
as
well
have
passed
the
ordinance
when
you
passed
the
resolution,
except
you
probably
would
rather
know
whether
it
was
constitutional
before
you
passed
it
as
an
ordinance?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
it
had
been
an
ordinance
when
the
resolution
was
passed?
what
if
it
had
been
done
in
the
form
of
an
ordinance?
the
district
court
would
have
done
exactly
the
same
thing
with
respect
to
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
court
addressed
itself
to
the
plans
submitted
by
the
city
under
the
resolution
and
said
it
was
constitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
did
it
purport
to
treat
that
as
a
court
plan
and
say,
i
approve
this
plan,
or
did
they,
you
know,
usually
if
the
city
passes
an
ordinance
it
is
not
a
court
plan,
it
is
just
something
you
either
accept
or
reject.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
the
court
do
with
respect
to
the
resolution?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
has
(voice
overlap)
that
plan
in
a
decree?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
you
do
not
do
that
with
an
ordinance,
that
you
uphold,
you
just
say
it
is
constitutional
and
you
look
to
the
ordinance
to
see
what
the
provisions
are.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
he
incorporate
the
very
terms
of
the
plan
in
the
decree?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
it
was
constitutional?
okay.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
do
not
see
why
we
are
talking
about
legislative
power,
we
are
trying
to
decide
what
standards
the
district
court
is
supposed
to
use
and
here
this
is
an
unambiguous
expression
of
the
lawmakers?
views
of
the
city
of
dallas.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
it
is
a
district
court
that
rejected
the
plan
as
unconstitutional
and
proceeded
to
draw
up
its
own,
might
be
something
else
again
or
if
the
city
lawyer
had
just
submitted
the
plan
without
any
evidence
that
it
was
official
policy
of
the
city?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
say
if
the
city
had
had
power
to
change
and
represent
this
scheme
overnight
by
an
ordinance
and
if
their
first
action
in
response
to
the
court's
suggestion
had
to
pass
a
new
ordinance,
the
case
would
be
different,
you
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
sounds
to
me
like
you
are
urging
that
the
substitute
plan
offered
was
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
not
exactly
one
man,
one
vote,
whitcomb
v.
chavez
certainly
rejects
any
notion
that
at-large
voting
in
the
city
is
per
se
or
even
semi
per
se,
in
doubt.
justice
byron
r.
white
district
court
said
that
it
gave
the
city
a
chance
to
come
up
with
a
plan
and
he
said,
"i
find
that
it
has
met
that
duty
in
enacting
the
eight/three
plan
of
electing
council
members."
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
may
be
so,
but
this
seems
to
me
rather
unambiguous
in
saying
that
in
his
view,
the
plan
wherever
it
came
from
passed
constitutional
muster.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
do
you
not
believe
that
the
intervenors
in
that
were
urging
that
the
plan
was
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
there
was
an
issue
before
the
judge
about
the
constitutionality
of
the
plan?
he
just
did
not
arrive
at
this
conclusion
sua
sponte?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
may
be,
but
the
intervenors
claimed
it
was
unconstitutional
and
he
said
the
plan
is
constitutional
and
did
you
appeal
that?
when
you
went
to
the
fifth
circuit
what
did
you
say
to
them?
what
did
you
raise
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
did
you
say
the
plan
was
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
here
is
what
the
fifth
circuit
said,
it
cannot,
however,
be
successfully
maintained
that
the
use
of
at-large
voting
to
select
three
council
members
is
itself
constitutionally
defective.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
texas,
when
it
was
covered
should
have
gone
back
and
submitted
every,
when
was
it
covered,
1972?
justice
byron
r.
white
1975,
so
it
should
have
gone
back
and
canvassed
all
the
changes
that
had
ever
been
made
since
1972
and
submitted
them
all
to
the
attorney
general?
justice
byron
r.
white
has
there
ever
been
a
court
decision
that
the
section
5
is
retroactive
like
that
or
do
you
just
read
it
on
its
face?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
is
possible
to
interpret
it,
i
suppose,
as
meaning
that
any
change
hereafter
that
was
not
in
effect
in
1972?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
all
right,
but
has
there
been
some
court
decisions
on
this
retroactivity?
justice
byron
r.
white
have
there
been
some
submissions
from
texas
since
it
was
included
based
on
the
fact
that
this
particular
practice
that
is
now
being
administered
was
instituted
in
1973
and
is
still
being
administered
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
has
never
even
been
construed
by
the
attorney
general,
until
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
the
time
the
judge
initially
passed
on
the
resolution,
texas
was
not
subject
to
the
voting
rights
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
was
then
free
to
pass
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
substitute,
whereas
today
if
they
had
been
subject
to
section
5,
he
would
not
have
been
free
to
address
the
constitutionality
of
this,
if
he
considered
this
to
be
a
legislative
submission
because
that
would
first
then
have
to
go
through,
under
section
5?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
went
off
in
another
direction
in
his
favor?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
section
5
issue
is
here
at
all?
it
was
not
decided
in
the
court
of
appeals,
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
again,
it
could
not
have
arisen
in
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
whenever
we
have
an
effect,
however,
he
does
not
have
to
in
a
court
ordered
plan,
he
does
need
to
live
up
to
section
5?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
my
brother
stewart
is
saying
that
this
is,
whatever
the
chronology
here,
this
qualifies
for
that
rule.
this
qualifies
as
a
court
rule
rather
than
a
legislative
rule
for
purposes
of
section
5?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
did
petition
for
you
except
mr.
werner
--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
this
case,
the
district
court
approved
a
reapportion
plan
for
the
city
council
of
dallas.
the
plan
included,
both
single
and
multi
member
districts.
court
of
appeals
disapproved
the
plan
because
in
its
view
the
plan
should
have
been
considered
as
judicial
rather
than
a
legislative
plan
and
subject
to
the
rule
applicable
judicial
plans
that
only
single
member
districts
should
be
used.
the
case
came
here
and
six
of
us
think
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
and
reverse
the
judgment,
but
we
hardly
speak
with
one
voice.
the
reasons
for
reversal
maybe
gleaned
from
an
opinion
that
i
have
filed,
joined
by
mr.
justice
stewart,
from
the
opinion
filed
by
mr.
justice
powell
joined
by
the
chief
justice,
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
an
interesting
sidelight
maybe
read
in
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
opinion,
joined
by
the
chief
justice,
mr.
justice
stewart
and
mr.
justice
powell
explaining
what
we
have
not
decided
in
the
case
and
we
have
however,
only
a
single
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
justice
marshall
has
filed
the
dissenting
opinion
and
justices
brennan
and
stevens
are
with
him
on
that
opinion.
