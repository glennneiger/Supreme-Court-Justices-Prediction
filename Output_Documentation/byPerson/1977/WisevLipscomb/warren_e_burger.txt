chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
wise
v.
lipscomb.
mr.
werner,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
a
totally
new
structure
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
an
order
of
the
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
you
are
confusing
me.
you
have
spoken
of
it
previously
as
a
resolution
not
an
ordinance.
now,
which
was
the
source
of
the
new
eight/three
plan?
a
resolution
or
an
ordinance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
was
pursuant
to
the
directives
of
the
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
when
he
approved
the
eight/three
plan,
it
was
simply
a
holding
of
the
court
that
it
passed
constitutional
standards,
but
it
is
not
part
of
a
decree?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
werner.
mr.
johnston.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
back
up
on
one
thing
that
has
left
me
somewhat
confused.
suppose
judge
mahon,
the
district
judge,
had
after
asking
the
city
to
make
suggestions
and
the
city
made
no
suggestions,
he
had
ordered
the
eight/three
plan
and
they
carried
it
out
without
a
resolution,
without
an
ordinance,
simply
carrying
out
the
court's
decree,
what
would
be
your
view
of
what
effect
that
would
have
on
your
posture
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
for
all
practical
purposes,
it
was
a
court
ordered
plan,
was
it
not
and
the
city
was,
simply
as
a
matter
of
comity
or
for
whatever
reasons,
passing
an
enactment
that
carried
out
what
they
knew
the
court
wanted
and
what
the
court
had
said
would
pass
constitutional
muster?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
particularly
difficult,
is
it
not
when
you
have
an
eight/three
plan
that
is
eight
of
them
elected
by
districts
and
only
three
at-large,
two
at-large,
really,
because
one
of
them
is
the
mayor.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
a
remand
is
a
question
not
an
answer.
if
we
were
sure
of
the
application,
we
would
summarily
decide
the
case,
but
if
not
being
clear,
we
send
it
back
and
ask
the
court
of
appeals
to
consider
the
relevance
of
east
carroll
and
others.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
does
that
prove
any
more
than
what
has
been
said
in
some
opinions
of
the
courts
that
people
do
not
necessarily
indulge
always
in
block
voting?
if
they
find
a
candidate
attractive,
they
will
vote
for
him
as
such,
that
is
what
indicates
the
reason
for
a
half
a
dozen
negro
mayors
in
the
united
states
in
large
cities,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
for
the
man,
not
on
a
racial
basis.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
buscemi.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
after
a
district
court
orders
it,
are
you
suggesting
that
it
must
be
pre-cleared,
that
the
judges
order
must
be
pre-cleared?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
it
not
the
judges
order?
is
this
not
the
judges
plan?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
why
is
it
subject
to
section
5
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
dallas
did
not
wish
to
have
it,
the
court
imposed
it
on
them,
dallas
did
not
want
it
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
it
wants
it,
something
as
though
after
it
is
ordered
by
this
court,
they
might
want
it,
but
they
did
not
want
it
in
the
first
place,
they
have
it
because
the
court
ordered
it,
have
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then
why
does
section
6
get
into
the
act?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
proposition
was
the
whole
state.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
at
1
o'clock.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
some
rebuttal.
i
think
you
have
one
minute
remaining,
mr.
buscemi.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
still
contend
that
this
case
is
subject
to
section
5
submission?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
the
city
doing
any
more
that
rubber
stamping
what
the
court
ordered?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
effect
then,
you
are
saying
that
the
judges
action
is
indirectly
subject
to
review
by
the
attorney
general?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
the
city
have
any
choice
about
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
werner,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
came
close
to
it
in
the
district
of
columbia
case,
did
we
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
case
that
was
decided
by
the
district
of
columbia
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
should
not
decide
it
if
the
court
of
appeals
has
not
had
an
opportunity
to
pass
on
it,
should
we?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
of
the
court
in
77-529,
wise,
the
mayor
of
dallas
against
lipscomb
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
white.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
white.
