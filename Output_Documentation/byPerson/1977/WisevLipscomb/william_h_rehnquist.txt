justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
was
no
finding
of
any
constitutional
violation
here,
was
there,
in
the
at-large
system?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they
did
not
find
a
one
man,
one
vote
violation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
why
should
there
be
any
difference?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
johnston,
does
it
have
authority
by
resolution
to
empower
its
legal
counsel
to
make
representations
to
the
district
court
in
a
case
like
this?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
sounds
like
we
are
going
back
to
the
forms
of
action
to
make
this
sort
of
distinction
between
a
court
saying
we
will
impose
a
plan,
but
let
us
hear
from
the
city
as
to
what
kind
of
a
plan
it
wants
and
saying
that
that
is
subject
to
a
different
standard
of
scrutiny
than
for
the
court
to
say
the
present
plan
is
unconstitutional
let
the
city
try
again?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
that
for
a
federal
court
to
decide?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
those
were
all
based
on
one
man,
one
vote
violation,
now
you
get
to
the
remedial
phase,
were
they
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
one
of
the
original
complaints
in
whitcomb
v.
chavez
was
not
the
multi
member
district's
violated
the
constitution,
but
that
there
was
a
violation
of
one
man,
one
vote
principle,
was
there
not
and
then
the
question
was
whether
the
remedy
was
appropriate?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
have
referred
counsel
several
times
to
wallace
v.
house,
that
is
not
a
case
of
this
court,
is
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
is
not
a
decision
on
the
merits
by
this
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
it
is
certainly
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
that
effect,
but
not
a
decision
of
this
court
to
that
effect?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
do
you
think
all
of
our
remands
are
that
precisely
tailored,
that
we
never
grant,
vacate
and
remand
except
having
thought
the
thing
through
that
carefully?
that
is
not
a
fair
question
to
ask
you.[laughter]
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
johnston,
was
connor
v.
finch
a
city
council
or
a
legislative
apportion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
not
a
fair
amount
of
expertise
in
city
management
and
city
government
to
the
effect
that
strictly
election
by
ward
does
tend
to
lead
to
pork
barreling
in
a
way
that
it
does
not
on
a
state
wide
basis?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
position
is
that
even
though
we
were
to
conclude
if
presented
with
the
issue
on
the
merits
that
an
eleven
man
at-large
city
council
would
not
be
unconstitutional,
the
district
court
simply
should
dismiss
the
complaint,
in
this
case
we
should
nevertheless
affirm
the
fifth
circuit
which
held
that
three
at-large
members
were
improper
remedially?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
can
you
know
that
in
a
state
like
texas?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
am
putting
to
you
the
question
was
texas.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
any
of
the
parties
to
this
action
in
their,
as
opposed
to
amicus
curiae
raised
the
voting
rights
act
issue?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
did
the
fifth
circuit
say?
