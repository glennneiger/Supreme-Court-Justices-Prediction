mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
the
contention
of
respondents
here
today
that
this
court
is
dealing
with
the
fact
situation
that
is
clearly
within
the
ambit
of
connor
v.
johnson
and
east
carroll
parish
v.
marshall.
we
believe
that
the
threshold
issue
is
the
standard
of
review
that
is
to
be
applied
by
an
appeals
court
and
that
that
standard
of
review
is
determined
by
whether
or
not
we
are
dealing
with
a
court
ordered
plan
or
a
legislated
plan.
it
is
our
contention
that
we
have
here
is
very
clearly
a
court
ordered
plan,
that
is
a
plan
that
was
ordered
into
existence
by
federal
court
exercising
its
equitable
jurisdiction
in
an
adversary
proceeding.
now,
there
is
some
ambiguity
in
the
record
as
it
is
presented
in
the
appendix
and
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
that
at
this
time.
your
questionings
already
have
indicated
some
elements
of
that
ambiguity.
i
would
point
out
on
page
147
of
the
appendix,
that
the
court
itself
stated
that
at
the
close
of
testimony
on
february
8th,
1975,
i
made
findings
which
approved
the
city?s
plan
as
constitutional.
accordingly,
i
order
that
the
eight/three
plan
as
had
been
offered
by
the
city
be
instituted
in
time
for
the
april
1975
city
council
election.
let
me
point
out
that
at
this
point
that
the
city
council
does
not
either
by
resolution
or
by
ordinance
have
the
power
to
change
the
election
system
in
the
city
of
dallas.
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
it
can
and
did
empower
its
legal
representatives
to
make
representations
to
the
court
and
i
have
here
and
can
supply
to
the
court
a
copy
of
the
accompanying
letter
that
counsel
for
the
city
sent
to
the
court
and
that
accompanying
letter
said,
pursuant
to
your
order
issued
january
17th,
i
am
enclosing
a
certified
copy
of
the
dallas
city
council
resolution
dated
january
20.
i
think
what
is
clear
here
is
that
this
resolution
was
offered
pursuant
to
an
order
of
the
court
to
offer.
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
i
think
the
distinction
has
to
be
made
as
to
whether
or
not
the
city
has
the
authority
to
try
again
under
its
own
legislative
scheme.
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
we
are
talking
about
legislative
power
and
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
texas
denies
to
the
city
council
the
right
to
change
its
election
scheme.
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
the
courts
had
before
it
in
the
east
carroll
the
same
kind
of
unambiguous
statement
of
what
the
city
would
choose
and
the
same
in
wallace
v.
brown.
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
the
case
laws
at
this
point
would
indicate
that
this
court
has
been
looking
as
in
east
carroll
to
the
authority
of
the
city
to
reorganize
its
legislation.
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
the
case
would
be
different,
i
would
still
urge
the
same
result
because
we
are
dealing
with
a
plan
that
was
offered
up
after
the
fact
of
dilution
of
black
voting
streams,
that
finding
had
already
made
by
it
the
trial
court.
we
are
not
talking
about
a
situation
where
in
the
course
of
litigation
the
city
changes
its
election
--
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
no,
we
are
saying
only
at
this
point
that
it
violates
the
federal
common
law
of
voting
rights.
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
that
language
is
not
my
own,
it
appears
in
--
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
no.
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
let
me
respond,
if
i
may.
in
east
carroll
parish
v.
marshall,
it
began
in
the
context
of
a
baker
v.
carroll,
one
man,
one
vote
case.
however,
when
the
court
approved,
the
parishes
posed
all
at-large
plan
in
1971,
mr.
marshall
intervened
alleging
that
that
plan
diluted
black
voting
strength
in
the
parish.
the
district
court
rejected
that
finding,
but
it
was
preserved
for
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
in
fact
that
there
had
been
a
dilution
of
black
voting
strength
as
alleged
by
mr.
marshall
and
so
when
that
case,
east
carroll
was
before
this
court,
it
was
before
this
court
on
that
basis
as
well
as
on
the
one
man,
one
vote
analysis.
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
fact
that
the
city
of
dallas
is
a
home
rule
city
should
not
overlook
the
fact
that
it
is
limited
in
its
ability
to
devise
its
own
election
scheme.
it
must
submit
that
to
--
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
that
is
correct,
but
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
federal
remedy
which
we
urge
and
which
east
carroll
urges
which
would
require
single
member
districts
absent
unusual
circumstances
it
is
particularly
appropriate
when
there
was
a
finding
by
the
district
court
as
a
result
of
an
adversary
proceeding
that
the
at-large
features
of
the
city
of
dallas
election
system
diluted
black
minority
voting
strength.
for
the
city
to
come
back
with
three
at-large
seats
preserving
that
same
feature
found
unconstitutional
which
seemed
to
me
--
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
the
district
court
had
already
made
findings
--
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
if
the
court
wishes
to
address
itself
to
that
issue,
it
may
do
so
--
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
no
one
else,
certainly
petitioners
have
not
raised
that
issue
and
did
not
appeal
in
either
court
--
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
that
is
correct
and
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
wallace
v.
house
had
dealt
with
a
commissioner
form
of
a
government
for
a
city
and
that
is
a
case
where
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
as
in
this
case
had
to
address
itself
with
that
issue.
this
court
remanded
that
case
to
the
fifth
circuit
for
a
review
in
light
of
east
carroll
parish.
the
circuit
examined
the
entire
record
and
examined
the
contentions
very
much
like
the
cities
here
that
at-large
elections
preserved
a
city
wide
view
and
rejected
that
as
having
established
any
kind
of
unusual
circumstances.
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
i
think
wallace
v.
house
tacitly
reaches
that
point
because
it
goes
immediately
to
the
remedy.
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
it
is
not
my
understanding
that
wallace
is
based
on
one
man,
one
vote.
my
reflection
on
the
record
in
that
case
indicates
that
there
was
an
allegation
of
and
a
finding
in
the
fifth
circuit
that
there
was
dilution
of
--
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
that
is
correct,
but
it
does
indicate
that
if
the
proof
is
there
and
white
v.
regester
goes
farther
than
that
and
says
that
the
proof
was
there
in
that
circumstance
then
you
have
established
a
constitutional
violation
of
equal
protection.
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
i
cannot
recall
the
record
of
it
at
that
point.
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
well,
our
posture
would
be
the
same,
that
it
was
in
fact
a
court
ordered
plan
--
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
and
what
the
court
would
require
as
a
remedy.
we
have
no
objections
as
such
and
did
not
object
at
that
time
to
the
city
offering
to
the
court
a
plan.
there
is
political
expertise
to
be
had
amongst
members
of
the
city
council
and
although
their
vote
was
not
unanimous,
their
input
was
important
and
we
did
not
object
to
it
as
such.
what
we
did
object
to,
what
we
did
appeal
from
was
preserving
those
same
at-large
features
that
the
court
had
rejected
in
finding
that
there
was
dilution
of
black
voting
strength.
now,
it
is
not
easy
to
prove
that
there
has
been
dilution
of
black
voting
strength
by
means
of
at-large
elections.
the
proof
is
not
simple,
but
it
was
met
in
this
case.
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
that
is
why
i
think
that
the
remedy
required
by
east
carroll
is
particularly
appropriate
in
these
kind
of
cases
because
it
instructs
the
city
or
whoever
is
working
with
the
court
in
order
to
purpose
a
plan
that
they
must
do
several
things
and
one
of
those
things
is
that
they
must
establish
that
there
are
unusual
circumstances
which
will
justify
the
continuation
of
any
at-large
features
in
that
plan.
it
is
particularly
appropriate
in
this
case.
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
well,
of
course
that
is
not
the
facts
before
us
now,
but
--
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
well,
one
would
have
to
and
i
presume,
one
would
seek
some
sort
of
injunctive
relief
from
--
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
the
fifth
circuit
in
this
case
never
reached
that
issue
and
did
not
speak
to
that
issue
at
all.
it
said
that
that
was
one
of
things
that
--
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
the
district
court
certainly
did.
let
me
point
out
--
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
that
is
correct
and
let
me
point
out
the
difficulties
that
anyone
litigating
a
plan
in
a
hurry
where
we
have
an
election
coming
up
in
april
and
we
were
in
february,
we
spent
five
years
attempting
to
prove
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
eleven
at-large
seats
in
city
of
dallas.
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
let
me
point
out
that
the
city
and
i
think
this
is
instructive.
we
have
supplied
the
court
with
a
copy
of
the
ballot
that
was
used
in
april
of
1976,
when
the
voters
finally
ratified
that
ordinance
and
finally
amended
the
charter
with
regard
to
the
change
in
election
scheme
and
that
ballot
on
page
16
of
the
document
we
supplied
the
court
which
begins
with
the
letter
from
mr.
werner
to
an
attorney
in
town,
and
it
says,
charter
chapter
3,
section
1
and
chapter
4
section
4,
6,
and
8
of
the
charter
of
the
city
of
dallas
be
amended
to
provide
for
the
compliance
with
the
federal
court
order
for
election
of
eight
members
to
the
city
council
from
single
member
districts
and
three,
including
the
mayor
at-large.
we
think
that
is
instructive
because
it
indicates
what
that
the
city
believed
as
we
believe
that
that
election
that
took
place
in
april
of
1976
was
a
housekeeping
measure
merely
to
reflect
the
changes
that
were
already
made
by
court
order
in
the
city
charter.
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
our
argument,
essentially,
was
that
it
was
an
inadequate
remedy.
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
the
judge
presumed
that
if
it
were
constitutional
--
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
it
would
be
inadequate
remedy,
although
i
may
point
out
that
the
judge
was
troubled
by
connor
v.
johnson
and
throughout
his
opinion
attempted
to
state
unusual
circumstances
such
as
the
mexican-american
situation
which
would
justify
the
plan,
but
we
were
not
anywhere
equipped
to
argue
the
constitutionality
of
that
plan
because
that
kind
of
proof
is
very
difficult
to
come
by
in
the
short
space
of
time
that
we
had.
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
that
is
correct.
let
me
also
point
out
that
as
the
government
has
pointed
out
in
its
brief
amicus
that
when
this
charter
amendment
was
passed
in
april
of
1976,
texas
was
at
that
time
covered
by
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965,
something
that
it
was
not
covered
when
the
case
was
tried
and
the
decision
was
rendered
in
1975
and
the
city
did
not
submit
that
case
to
the
attorney
general
for
pre-clearance.
the
inference
is
that
the
city
believed
that
plan
to
be
a
court
ordered
plan
which
was
not
required
to
be
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
under
the
court's
language
in
connor
v.
johnson.
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
the
judges
opinion
is
ambiguous
in
several
respects.
in
that
way
it
is
ambiguous
because
the
court
later
on
points
out
on
page
151
of
the
appendix
that
the
members
of
the
council
cannot
on
their
own
modify
the
charter
to
alter
the
voting
scheme.
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
it
is
clear
in
the
court's
belief
--
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
i
think
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
well,
i
can
only
respond
that
the
court
was,
as
were
the
parties,
operating
under
intense
time
pressure
--
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
well,
the
issue
that
we
raised
in
the
fifth
circuit
was
the
appropriateness
of
the
remedy.
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
that
appeal
was
some
years
ago,
i
--
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
that
is
correct
and
there
is
plenty
of
language
from
this
court
indicating
that
at-large
features
in
and
off
themselves
must
be
attacked
on
the
factual
matrix
in
which
they
develop.
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
well,
i
would
say
that
wallace
v.
house
and
then
applying
it
to
the
parish
as
in
east
carroll
indicates
the
court
is
willing
to
go
further
than
that.
on
this
subject,
let
me
conclude
by
saying
that
it
is
very
difficult
--
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
yes,
it
is.
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
you
remanded
it
for
consideration
in
light
of
east
carroll.
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
well,
to
the
extent
that
the
court
of
appeals
took
it
to
mean
that
what
was
involved
was
the
east
carroll
issue
which
is
a
one
issue
case,
essentially.
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
well,
i
would
only
say,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
the
clear
implication
of
the
remand
of
wallace
v.
house
was
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
must
consider
was
the
appropriateness
of
the
remedy.
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
exactly,
and
of
course,
the
court
of
appeals
did
do
that
and
cert
was
denied
by
this
court.
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
well,
the
court
of
appeals
did
reconsider.
it
asked
itself
the
question
of
why
the
case
was
remanded
rather
than
simply
reversed
or
affirmed
and
concluded
that
the
appropriateness
of
the
remedy
under
east
carroll
was
a
factual
and
that
they
could
undertake
it
because
they
had
a
complete
record
before
them
and
they
undertook
at
that
point
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
were
unusual
circumstances,
found
that
there
were
not
in
the
face
of
claims
much
like
the
city
of
dallas
here,
and
as
i
--
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
it
did
and
certiorari
was
denied,
that
is
correct.
i
find
it
difficult
to
distinguish
this
case
from
east
carroll
and
from
wallace
v.
house,
all
the
cases
that
have
gone
through
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
fifth
circuit.
each
time
there
were
plans
submitted
by
the
legislative
body
pursuant
to
court
order
each
time
that
that
legislative
body
lacked
the
authority
to
draw
up
a
plan,
it
did
not
have
the
authority
for
one
reason
or
another
to
implement
the
plan.
in
east
carroll
it
was
because
of
a
challenge
under
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
to
the
enabling
legislation
and
in
each
case
the
plan
was
ordered
into
effect
by
the
court.
now,
once
you
reach
the
threshold
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
rule
of
east
carroll
is
going
to
be
applied,
the
issue
becomes
whether
or
not
there
were
unusual
circumstances
which
would
justify
preservation
of
the
at-large
features.
the
district
court
found
such
in
the
mexican-american
presence
in
the
city
of
dallas,
a
minority
group
containing
8-10%
of
the
population
of
the
city
of
dallas.
the
trial
court's
findings
are
confusing
and
contradictory
and
i
think,
ultimately
not
based
on
fact,
and
therefore,
abuse
of
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court.
the
trial
court
found
that
there
was
no
present
delusion
of
mexican-american
voting
strengths,
although
there
might
have
been
delusion
in
the
past.
the
court
of
appeals,
accordingly
indicated
that
because
there
was
no
present
delusion
their
access
was
equal
to
that
of
the
white
majority,
and
therefore,
there
was
no
need
to
enhance
the
benefits
by
these
three
at-large
seats.
but
more
importantly
it's
contention
of
the
respondents
that
in
order
for
there
to
be
an
unusual
circumstance
to
support
the
mexican-american
issue
raised
by
the
district
court
there
would
have
to
be
facts
in
the
record
to
support
a
finding
that
single
member
districts
would
restrict
the
access
of
mexican-american
voters
and
there
are
no
such
findings
in
the
record.
in
fact,
the
district
court
could
only
conclude
that
mexican-american
voters
might
suffer
restriction
and
access
under
the
single
member
district
plan.
the
record
that
we
presented
to
the
court
indicates
that
in
a
single
member
district
plan
such
as
the
ones
we
proposed,
a
district,
district
number
two
would
contain
approximately
one
third
of
mexican-american
population
and
as
such,
mexican-americans
practicing
the
politics
of
coalition
as
the
court
of
appeals
called
it
would
have
a
far
greater
input
into
the
election
of
members
of
the
council
than
they
would
when
they
comprised
only
8-10%
of
the
population.
in
fact,
we
presented
to
the
court
a
witness,
a
mexican-american
by
the
name
of
robert
madrano,
who
had
run
at-large
for
a
school
board
seat
and
lost
and
then
when
they
changed
to
an
all
single
member
district
plan
had
won
in
a
seat
that
was
approximately
evenly
divided
between
blacks,
mexican-american,
and
white
voters,
therefore
demonstrating
and
the
only
factual
demonstration
in
the
record
that
mexican-americans
could
in
fact
win
in
single
member
district
circumstances.
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
it
does
not,
in
fact,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
helps
--
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
however,
the
record
as
developed
in
the
trial
of
this
cause
from
every
expert
witness
indicates
that
in
the
city
of
dallas,
we
have
the
unfortunate
situation
where
block
voting
along
racial
lines
is
the
rule
and
anything
else
is
the
exception.
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
the
record
will
also
show
in
this
case
that
since
the
institution
of
the
eight/three
plan
ordered
by
the
district
court,
there
has
not
been
a
mexican-american
candidate
elected
to
the
city
council
in
the
city
of
dallas.
previously
there
had
been
one,
but
since
this
time,
although
they
have
run,
i
do
not
believe,
i
think
the
record
will
indicate
that,
none
of
them
have
won
more
than
a
third
of
the
vote,
and
therefore,
have
failed
in
their
efforts
to
be
elected
at-large.
the
court
itself
acknowledged
in
its
opinion
that
at-large
voting
might
operate
in
part
as
a
restriction
of
the
access
of
american
voters
and
we
think
there
is
simply
no
evidence
to
support
them
as
unusual
circumstances.
finally,
let
me
address
briefly
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
a
city
wide
viewpoint
can
also
be
an
unusual
circumstance.
i
point
to
the
court's
opinion
in
last
time
connor
v.
finch
where
this
court
indicated
that
historic
policy
in
multi
member
districts
was
not
a
sufficient
reason
to
uphold
multi
member
districts
and
in
wallace
v.
house
itself
the
court
of
appeals
originally
attempted
to
justify
a
single
at-large
seat
among
five
on
grounds
that
they
were
avoiding
ward
parochialism,
a
contention
subsequently
rejected
on
remand.
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
it
was
legislative
apportion.
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
if
there
is
such
study,
it
was
not
in
evidence
in
this
case.
that
was
asserted
by
some
politicians
who
had
been
elected
at-large.
mr.
james
a.
johnston,
jr.
yes,
sir.
in
response
to
the
question
by
mr.
justice
powell,
i
believe
you
asked
does
it
make
a
difference
that
we
have
had
at-large
voting
since
1907,
i
believe
you
asked
that
question
of
mr.
johnston.
looking
at
mr.
justice
blackmun?s
opinion
in
the
chapman
case,
i
get
the
feeling
that
this
theory
is
based
on
a
deference
to
state
action
and
that
what
is
really
critical
here
is
whether
the
federal
courts
are
imposing
some
system
of
elections
on
a
state
which
is
contrary
to
established
state
policy.
now,
if
that
is
what
we
are
really
dealing
with
here,
i
think
it
is
clear
that
the
use
of
at-large
voting
in
dallas
city
elections
is
a
clearly
established
state
policy
both
in
the
state
of
texas
and
the
city
of
dallas
and
that
there
is
no
affront
to
the
sovereignty
of
the
state
of
texas
by
virtue
of
this
federal
court
order
which
either
orders
or
approves
the
use
of
at-large
voting.
we
had
places,
what
we
are
dealing
with
here,
places
9,
10
and
11
on
our
city
council,
those
places
9,
10,
and
11
were
at-large
places
beginning
with
the
charter
of
1968
was
when
we
went
from
9
to
11
members,
so
places
9,
10,
and
11
remain
absolutely
unchanged
since
1968.
furthermore,
as
a
direct
response
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
powell,
we
have
had
at-large
voting
generally
since
1907
and
that
of
course
was
instituted
in
the
city
of
dallas
before
we
had
home
rule
and
it
was
done
by
the
act
of
the
texas
legislature
in
1907,
so
we
have
had
it
continuously
in
various
forms
since
1907.
we
have
had
it
in
our
charter
with
respect
to
these
exact
three
positions
on
the
council
since
1968
and
i
think
there
is
absolutely
no
question
that
this
at-large
voting,
and
of
course,
it
is
the
at-large
voting
that
we
are
arguing
about
here
today
that
is
in
contention,
and
clearly
the
federal
court
did
not
impose
at-large
voting
contrary
to
established
state
policy,
so
i
see
no
reason
to
invoke
the
east
carroll
rule
in
this
situation.
now,
mr.
justice
brennan,
with
respect
to
the
submission
of
the
charter
amendment
under
section
5,
i
think,
very
clearly,
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
requires
pre-clearance.
now,
the
only
problem
that
we
see
with
this
is
that
as
we
all
recognize,
whether
this
is
a
court
ordered
plan
or
whether
it
is
a
court
approved
plan,
a
federal
district
judge
has
indicated
his
approval
of
the
plan
and
so,
if
we
come
to
the
point
where
we
submit
the
plan
to
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
columbia,
i
think
we
are
submitting,
in
effect,
the
approval
of
the
local
district
judge
to
the
further
approval
of
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
columbia.
