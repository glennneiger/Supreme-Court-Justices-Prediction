justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
werner,
is
that
quite
correct.
was
it
not
true
that
there
was
oral
opinion
first
which
was
then
followed
by
the
ordinance,
which
was
then
followed
what
mr.
justice
powell
just
read?
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
january
20th.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
on
february
8th
there
was
the
remedy
hearing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
which
he
made
an
oral
decision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
there
was
an
ordinance,
which
is
number
14800,
which
refers
back
to
the
oral
decision,
is
that
not
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
after
the
ordinance
was
passed,
there
was
then
the
written
decision
that
mr.
justice
powell
read
from
in
march.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
this
is
after
the
ordinance,
whereas
the
oral
decision
was
between
the
resolution
and
the
ordinance?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
i
am
not
correct,
mr.
werner,
at
the
time
of
the
ordinance,
there
had
already
been
a
decision
by
the
court
because
the
ordinance
itself
refers
to
the
decision
and
i
call
you
attention
to
page
a
2
of
the
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
johnston,
was
is
it
part
of
your
submission
in
opposing
the
eight/three
ordinance,
that
it
was
unconstitutional
or
did
you
merely
argue
that
it
was
an
inadequate
remedy
for
the
previously
found
constitutional
violation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
there
really
has
never
been
an
issue
that
anybody
has
had
to
decide
as
to
whether
the
eight/three
order
was
constitutional
or
unconstitutional,
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
be
an
adequate
remedy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
the
fact
or
the
conclusion
of
constitutionality
were
the
end
of
the
case,
he
would
not
have
needed
even
to
address
the
question
of
the
mexican-americans,
is
that
not
correct?
