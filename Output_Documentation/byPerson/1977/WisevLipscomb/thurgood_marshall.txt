the
record
also
shows
that
when
the
primary
case
was
won
on
april
14th,
in
1944,
all
of
the
negroes
in
dallas
were
the
solid
block
and
by
election
time
they
had
split
into
four
different
groups,
that
is
what
the
records
show,
four
groups
and
that
was
about
five
months.
justice

if
we
agree
with
you
to
reverse
as
the
chapter
5,
how
does
section
5
come
into
that?
you
want
the
district
court,
you
want
to
erase
the
court
of
appeals
and
go
back
to
district
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
does
chapter
5
affect
that?
