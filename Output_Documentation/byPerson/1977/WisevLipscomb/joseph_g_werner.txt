mr.
joseph
g.
werner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
joseph
werner,
counsel
for
petitioners
in
this
case,
the
mayor
and
city
council
of
the
city
of
dallas.
this
is
a
civil
rights
case
in
which
negro
voters
of
the
city
of
dallas
challenge
the
all
at-large
system
of
electing
the
city
council
in
dallas.
the
district
court
held
at
that
that
all
at-large
system
was
unconstitutional
and
that
it
denied
negro
voters
equal
protection.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
no,
sir.
no
consideration.
it
was
alleged
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
no,
sir,
there
is
no
question
of
sims,
since
it
was
a
purely
at-large
system
in
the
beginning.
there
is
no
question
of
a
numerical
imbalance.
it
was
a
white
versus
register
type
dilution
problem.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
no,
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
yes,
sir.
we
started
out
with
all
eleven
members
of
the
council
elected
at-large
city
wide.
the
district
court
found
that
that
system
was
unconstitutional
and
that
it
denied
equal
protection
to
the
negro
voters.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
no,
sir.
the
issue
--
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
no
sir.
as
i
said,
because
it
was
purely
at-large
in
the
beginning
and
there
was
no
possibility
of
a
numerical
imbalance.
the
district
court,
after
it
held
the
previous
system
unconstitutional,
gave
the
city
of
dallas
and
the
city
council
an
opportunity
to
come
up
with
a
plan
to
remedy
this
constitutional
violation.
the
court
held
hearing
subsequently
in
which
it
received
this
eight/three
plan
which
was
generated
by
the
city
council
and
this
plan
involves
the
election
of
eight
of
the
eleven
council
members
from
single
member
districts
and
the
election
of
the
remaining
three
members
at-large,
city
wide.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
yes,
sir.
the
process
was,
on
the
17th
of
january,
the
court
held
the
original
plan
unconstitutional.
three
days
later
the
city
council
adopted
a
resolution
which
informed
the
court
that
it
was
the
intent
of
the
council
to
pass
an
ordinance
which
would
adopt
this
eight/three
plan.
on
february
the
5th,
the
court
commenced
hearings
on
this
proposed
eight/three
plan
and
on
two
alternate
plans
submitted
by
the
plaintiffs
in
the
case.
on
the
8th
of
february
the
district
judge
announced
a
preliminary
finding
that
he
considered
the
eight/three
plan
to
be
constitutional.
two
days
later,
after
the
conclusion
of
that
hearing,
the
city
council
adopted
the
ordinance
14800
which
promulgated
as
law,
the
eight/three
plan.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
except
by
resolution.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
well,
i
think
if
it
had
been
an
ordinance,
there
would
not
be
any
question
at
this
point.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
well,
i
think
in
fairness
to
the
respondents
in
this
case,
there
is
some
ambiguity
in
the
resolution.
i
think
it
clearly
indicates
that
what
the
legislative
body
favored
was
the
eight/three
plan.
however,
the
resolution
--
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
mr.
justice
powell,
what
we
had
here
was
a
previous
plan
prescribed
by
a
charter.
now,
obviously
the
charter,
somewhat
like
our
city
constitution,
cannot
be
amended
except
by
vote
of
the
people.
however,
after
the
district
judge
--
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
yes,
sir.
after
the
order
of
district
court
declaring
it
unconstitutional
in
that
charter
provision
our
position
has
ceased
to
exist
and
we
have
the
authority
as
a
home
rule
of
city
under
the
laws
of
texas
to
evidence
our
actions
either
by
resolution
by
ordinance
or
by
vote
of
the
people
in
the
form
of
the
charter.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
mr.
justice
brennan,
frankly,
we
do
not
know
at
this
point.
we
cannot
recall
and
i
assume,
that
that
is
what
we
were
doing.
if
we
had
the
benefit
of
chapman
v.
meier,
which
was
decided
within
a
few
days
--
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
yes,
sir,
i
think
it
would
have
and
i
think,
if
it
had
been
passed
as
an
ordinance
a
few
days
before
the
hearing
then
there
would
be
no
question
that
the
city
had
promulgated
this
plan
as
law
and
then
it
was
binding.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
mr.
justice
powell,
if
i
said
that
i
have
misled
the
court
and
you,
sir...
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
well,
mr.
justice
powell,
what
happened
here
was
that
on
the
8th
of
february
there
was
no
order
entered
and
the
docket
does
not
reflect
any
order,
what
happened
was
the
judge
made
a
preliminary
finding
that
he
considered
the
eight/three
plan
to
be
acceptable.
there
was
no
written
order
of
any
description
entered
until
march
25th
about
six
weeks
later
and
of
course,
the
judgment
in
the
case
was
not
entered
until
may
the
22nd
which
was
about
three
and
a
half
months
later
so
we
did
not
consider
at
that
point
that
there
had
been
any,
at
that
time
the
ordinance
was
adopted,
we
did
not
consider
that
there
had
been
any
binding
order
of
the
court.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
yes,
sir.
if
we
have
misled
you
and
the
court,
we
apologize
for
that,
but
i
think
the
contention
between
the
parties
has
always
been
the
authority
of
the
city
to
make
a
change
to
the
election
plan
through
the
means
of
an
ordinance
rather
than
by
a
charter
amendment
and
i
do
not
think
at
that
time
any
of
the
parties
considered
the
timing
of
this
ordinance
to
be
critical
and
i
do
not
think
we
considered
that
the
ordinance
was
adopted
after
an
order
of
the
court.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
they
were
both.
on
the
20th
of
january
before
the
remedy
hearing,
there
was
a
resolution
passed
stating
the
intention
of
the
council
to
adopt
the
eight/three
plan.
then
the
remedy
hearing
was
held
in
the
district
court
and
then
two
days
after
the
conclusion
of
that
hearing
the
ordinance
was
passed.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
no,
sir,
there
was
no
directive
from
the
court
that
we
pass
an
ordinance.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
yes,
sir,
on
february
the
8th
at
the
conclusion
of
the
hearing,
judge
mahon,
the
district
judge,
made
a
rather
lengthy
statement
from
the
bench
in
which
he
said
that
he
finds
the
eight/three
plan,
in
his
words,
passes
constitutional
muster,
and
he
said
he
would
later
issue
an
opinion.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
yes,
sir.
the
first
writing
from
the
court
--
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
i
may
have
misunderstood
your
question,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
no,
sir,
only
by
saying
that
he
found
that
it
was
constitutional.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
no,
sir.
and
there
was
no
written
order
of
any
description
entered
until
long
after
the
ordinance
was
enacted.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
yes,
sir,
and
then
--
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
yes,
sir,
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
mr.
justice
stevens,
there
was
the
resolution,
then
--
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
yes,
march
25th.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
well,
i
think
the
reference
is
to
the
ordinance,
but
i
cannot
be
certain
what
he
meant.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
yes
sir,
it
refers
to
the
oral
decision
and
if
i
may,
i
will
read
from
the
transcript
of
the
judge?s
remarks,
this
is
volume
11
of
the
original
transcript,
page
86,
the
court
says,
?this
court
has
accepting
--
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
no,
sir,
it
is
not
reproduced
in
the
appendix.
the
district
judge
says,
this
court
is
accepting
the
city
plan
of
eight/three.
i
am
ordering
that
the
election
schedule
for
april
of
this
year
will
proceed
and
elect
the
city
council
for
this
year
under
the
city
plan
of
eight/three
that
has
been
presented
to
this
court.
at
the
same
time,
this
court
will,
i
am
going
to
enter
a
final
order,
i
mean
an
adjustment
in
the
opinion
that
is
going
to
take
me
several
days,
and
so
forth.
so
he
indicated
at
that
time
that
it
seems
to
us
that
this
was
a
tentative
or
preliminary
decision
on
the
matter
and
that
he
intended
shortly
thereafter
to
render
his
official
decision
on
the
case.
now,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
it
is
our
position
that
at
the
time
that
the
court
first
entered
a
written
order
in
its
first
binding
order
that
the
city
council
had
already
promulgated
as
law
this
eight/three
plan
which
is
in
contention.
by
the
time
the
filing
date
arrived
for
the
ensuing
election,
the
plan
had
been
promulgated
as
law,
and
by
the
time
the
judgment
was
finally
entered
in
case,
of
course,
the
plan
had
been
promulgated
as
law
by
the
city
council.
we
contend
that
because
the
council
had
promulgated
as
law
this
election
plan
with
full
authority
under
state
law
that
this
is
not
a
court
order
plan
and
that
the
special
circumstances
rule
of
the
east
carroll
case
should
not
apply.
we
suggest
instead
that
the
rule
of
burns
v.
richardson
applies
and
that
the
plan
should
be
subject
only
to
constitutional
review.
alternatively,
we
submit
to
the
court,
that
even
if
the
east
carroll
rule
is
applicable,
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
erred
in
saying
that
the
special
circumstances
present
in
the
case
which
deal
with
the
voting
situation
of
mexican-american
voters
can
be
considered
only
if
there
is
a
constitutional
violation
and
we
think
that
this
is
contrary
to
indications
that
we
see
in
the
opinion
in
the
united
u.s.
organizations
v.
carrie
case.
we
do
not
think
that
special
circumstances
in
a
case
like
this
depend
on
a
prior
showing
of
a
constitutional
violation
and
we
think
that
in
this
case
as
in
any
equitable
case
or
decree
in
equity
that
the
court
should
take
into
consideration
the
general
public
interest
and
should
not
enter
a
decree
which
will
harm
any
segment
of
the
population
and
we
think
that
the
findings
of
the
district
court
show
that
if
and
all
single
member
district
plan
were
put
into
effect
that
the
mexican-american
voters
would
very
definitely
harmed
by
that
decree.
the
other
issue
in
the
case
which
supports
the
use
of
a
mixed
at-large
and
single
member
system
is
the
finding
of
the
district
court
that
it
would
be
beneficial
to
the
city
to
have
general
citywide
interest
represented
on
the
council
so
as
to
provide
factionalism
among
wards
within
the
city
and
so
that
the
city
council
members
would
be
exposed
to
a
more
statesmanlike
view
and
that
projects
of
interest
to
the
city
in
general
would
not
suffer
from
having
been
subjected
to
ward
interest
and
the
factionalism.
may
it
please
the
court,
we
will
reserve
the
rest
of
our
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
very
briefly,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
yes,
sir.
and
the
reason
why
i
think
this
is
significant
is
that
i
really
do
not
think
this
is
what
the
congress
had
in
mind.of
course,
in
the
sheffield
case
the
court
construed
the
intent
of
the
congress
in
enacting
section
5
and
i
really
do
not
think
what
the
congress
meant
to
do
was
to
have
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
columbia
or
the
attorney
general
review
something
that
had
already
been
sanctioned
by
--
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
no.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
yes,
sir,
and
i
think
there
is
a
difference
here
between
what
the
district
court
did.
basically
we
had
ourselves
a
fourteenth
amendment
lawsuit
in
the
local
district
court
and
i
think
section
5
clearance
is
more
closely
aligned
with
fifteenth
amendment
problems
and
so
--
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
the
respondents
raised
it
in
the
fifth
circuit,
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
they
disregarded
that.
they
said
nothing
about
it
in
their
opinion.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
well,
until
very
recently,
until
sheffield
was
decided
we
did
not
think
that
we
had
to
submit
anything,
frankly
and
we
did
submit
some
polling
place
changes
and
things
like
that
over
the
last
couple
of
years
because
we
were
afraid
if
we
were
to
pick
that
up
if
sheffield
were
decided
against
us,
we
were
afraid
the
administrative
burden
would
just
be
too
much
so
we
went
ahead
and
submitted
those,
but
we
did
not
submit
the
charter
amendment
for
two
reasons.
one
was
the
question
that
the
court
just
settled
in
sheffield
and
the
other
was
that
we
were
not
sure
about
this
question
of
whether
it
was
the
fact
that
the
district
court
would
indicate
some
approval
about
it,
but
to
try
to
clarify
my
point
about
the
effect
of
what
the
local
district
judge
has
done
here,
i
do
not
think
that
just
the
fact
that
the
local
district
judge
has
approved
the
plan
on
some
points
and
possibly
not
on
the
substantive
issues
required
by
the
voting
rights
act,
necessarily
means
that
we
do
not
have
to
submit
it.
what
troubles
us
in
this
respect
is
that
we
do
not
really
think
that
that
is
what
the
congress
intended
to
do,
i
think
what
the
congress
intended
to
do
was
to
prevent
evasions
and
regressions
that
some
of
the
southern
states
had
resorted
to
in
the
wake
of
the
court
decision.
in
other
words,
the
court
would
invalidate
a
certain
electoral
device
and
then
just
as
it
dodged
or
an
evasion
then
the
local
government
body
or
the
state
would
resort
to
some
other
change.
i
think
clearly,
that
is
not
what
has
happened
here
and
so,
although,
as
i
readily
concede,
we
are
covered
under
the
literal
language
of
section
5,
i
am
not
sure
we
are
included
in
the
congressional
intent.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
it
was
not
treated
in
either
of
the
courts
below,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
no,
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
no,
sir,
that
is
not
exactly
what
i
am
saying.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
i
can
hypothesize
a
situation
where
a
district
court
would
approve
a
plan
on
grounds
other
than
something
that
would
satisfy
the
voting
rights
act.
the
district
court
might
not
really
address
itself
to
what
i
regard
as
issues
more
closely
related
to
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
still,
in
a
case
like
this,
an
approved
plan,
which
was
challenged
only
on
fourteenth
amendment
grounds.
so
what
i
am
saying
is,
i
do
not
think
that
the
local
district
court
necessarily
covers
all
the
issues
that
would
be
covered
in
a
submission
to
the
attorney
general
or
the
d.c.
district
court.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
yes,
sir,
i
understand
that.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
that
is
why
i
am
trying
not
to
accept
the
invitation
tendered
by
justice
stewart.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
well,
then
we
are
in
the
position
of
being
under
the
literal
language
of
section
5,
but
possibly
not
within
the
congressional
intent
because
we
did
not
do
this
as
an
evasion
--
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
well,
this
is
a
situation
which
the
court
has
not
precisely
addressed
itself
to.
it
is
a
little
bit
different
from
perkins
and
the
other
cases
--
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
i
cannot
answer
that
case.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
yes
sir.
this
would
not
be
what
we
regard
as
a
disaster
to
have
to
submit
it
to
the
attorney
general
or
the
d.c.
court
--
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
as
we
just
said,
it
was
not
raised
below
and
it
was
--
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
i
think
at
best
it
should
go
back
to
the
district
court
to
be
considered.
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
the
next
council
election
will
be
in
april
1979.
we
have
council
elections
only
in
april
of
odd
numbered
years
sometime,
but
at
other
times
--
mr.
joseph
g.
werner
yes,
sir,
we
have
ample
time
for
that.
thank
you
very
much.
