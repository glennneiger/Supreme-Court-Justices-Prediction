justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
werner?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
referred
the
plan
having
been
generated
by
the
city
council
would
you
tell
us
exactly
how
that
happened
step
by
step?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
city
council
had
not
adopted
the
plan
until
after
the
court
approved
the
plan
that
was
suggested?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
the
resolution
in
the
record?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
let
me
ask
you
this
question,
did
the
city
council
have
any
power
or
authority
to
approve
a
plan
definitively?
did
it
not
have
to
be
submitted
to
the
voters?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
werner,
the
question
i
am
now
going
to
ask
you
is
not
addressed
to
merits
in
this
case,
but
you
filed
an
application
for
a
stay
with
me
last
august,
at
least
your
name
is
on
it,
and
it
states
the
city
council
reapportioned
itself,
enacted
an
ordinance
and
thereafter
that
the
court
held
hearing,
now
that
is
an
error,
i
take
it
from
what
you
now
say?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
think,
i
repeated
it
in
the
chambers
opinion
and
i
will
say
this
in
fairness,
the
district
courts
said
pretty
much
the
same
thing,
but
i
now
understand
from
the
facts
that
is
not
what
happened.
i
am
not
suggesting
that
it
makes
any
difference
that
mr.
justice
white
indicates,
but
i
do
suggest
that
the
papers
filed
here,
and
while
i
am
on
this
subject,
i
must
say
that
the
response
to
your
application
did
not
clarify
it
either.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
just
want
to
clarify
that.
i
felt
that
i
find
these
other
papers
in
this
case
that
both
parties
had
failed
adequately
to
inform
me
even
this
matter
was
before
me
last
summer.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
think
i
have
the
mind
of
the
district
court
that
mr.
justice
white
may
have
in
mind,
it
is
on
page
b
16
in
the
petition
at
the
end
of
the
middle
paragraph.
that
is
b
16.
this
court
then
gave
the
city
of
dallas
an
opportunity
to
perform
its
duty
to
enact
a
constitutionally
acceptable
plan.
i
find
that
it
has
met
that
duty
in
enacting
the
eight/three
plan
of
electing
council
members.
now
in
light
of
what
i
now
understand,
the
court,
to
say
the
least,
used
the
word
enacting
somewhat
loosely.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
is
my
understanding,
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
think
it
makes
any
difference
in
this
connection
between
a
city
such
as
dallas
which
has
had
at-large
voting
since
1907
and
the
parish
in
louisiana
that
had
had
at-large
voting
only
since
1968?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
no,
i
think
chapman
v.
meier
of
south
dakota
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
north
dakota,
well,
did
not
the
court
say
that
mr.
justice
blackmun
would
correct
me
that
there
had
been
no
tradition
in
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
not
in
the
senate.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
the
court
made
a
point
of
that?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
tell
me
mr.
werner,
i
guess,
i
gather
from
what
you
say,
at
least
no
decision
has
yet
been
made
by
dallas
whether
or
not
to
submit
--
