mr.
peter
buscemi
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
begin
by
saying
that
i
think
that
mr.
justice
stewart
is
correct
in
suggesting
that
this
court
has
never
found
at-large
municipal
elections
to
be
unconstitutional.
this
court
in
east
carroll
parish
school
board
v.
marshall,
however,
did
find
that
the
district
court
in
ordering
at-large
elections,
not
only
the
east
carroll
parish
school
board,
but
also
for
the
parish
jury
which
is
the
local
legislative
body
had
violated
the
remedial
principles
that
this
court
has
set
out
in
numerous
reapportionment
cases,
all
of
them
beginning
with
one
man,
one
vote
violations.
mr.
peter
buscemi
as
this
one
did
not,
that
is
right.
in
addition
to
the
east
carroll
case
this
court
has
recognized
in
duch
v.
davis
and
in
dallas
county,
alabama
v.
reese
that
there
is
the
possibility
that
at-large
municipal
elections,
local
elections,
either
county
or
city,
may
result
in
the
minimization
or
the
canceling
out,
to
use
the
court's
words,
of
the
votes
of
particular,
identifiable
minority
groups.
mr.
peter
buscemi
that
is
true
and
that
is
what
the
basis
of
the
courts
holding
was
in
whitcomb
v.
chaviz
where
the
court
found
that
there
was
no
restriction
of
access
by
blacks
to
the
political
process,
but
the
blacks
were
primarily
democrats,
there
were
lots
of
republicans
in
indiana
and
the
republicans
won
a
lot
of
elections
and
as
the
consequence
of
that
there
were
very
few
blacks
that
were
elected
to
the
state
legislature
from
marion
county,
indiana,
but
that
is
not
what
the
district
court
found
in
this
case
and
i
think
the
evidence
supports
the
findings
of
the
district
court.
mr.
peter
buscemi
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart,
there
may
very
well
be
a
difference
there
and
we
are
not
contending
and
the
respondents
are
not
contending
-
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
this
case
as
it
stands
now
it
does
not
really
involve
the
constitutional
rule.
we
are
talking
about
a
remedy
that
has
been
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
that
is
true
and
the
district
court
found
that
in
the
circumstances
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
in
dallas
there
was
a
defect.
mr.
peter
buscemi
that
is
right.
this
court
need
not
find
that
the
election
of
three
council
members
at-large
is
unconstitutional
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
that
is
right
and
this
court
has
said,
admittedly
in
one
man,
one
vote
cases
that
reapportionment
should
prefer
single
member
districts
and
that
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
not
in
the
context
of
at-large
dilution.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
in
east
carroll
for
example
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
no,
it
is
a
parish
police
jury.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
i
think
that
the
only
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
the
remedy
was
improper.
now,
as
mr.
justice
stewart
suggests,
if
the
court
finds
that
at-large
elections
may
be
ordered
as
a
remedy
because
the
court
does
not
believe
that
there
is
any
constitutional
violation
involved
in
all
eleven
being
elected
at-large
then
presumably,
the
court
would
not
need
to
affirm,
but
our
suggestion
here
is
that
the
violation
that
was
found
was
indeed
a
violation
and
that
the
appropriate
remedy
for
a
court
ordered
reapportionment
plan
involves
single
member
districts.
now,
as
the
district
court
pointed
out,
dallas
is
completely
free
to
present
the
eight/three
plan
to
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
or
to
the
attorney
general
for
pre-clearance
under
section
58
of
the
voting
rights
act
and
then,
if
the
plan
is
pre-cleared,
it
will
go
into
effect
and
any
court
ordered
remedy
for
the
constitutional
violation
found
will
be
over.
mr.
peter
buscemi
no,
not
at
all.
mr.
peter
buscemi
right
now,
this
is
a
court
ordered
plan,
that
is
right.
we
are
suggesting
that
the
court
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
we
are
saying
that
as
a
court
ordered
plan
it
is
defective
because
it
departs
from
the
remedial
principles
announced
by
this
court
in
earlier
cases.
we
are
saying
that
if
dallas
wishes
to
have
this
plan
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
that
is
true,
but
dallas
now
says
that
it
wants
the
eight/three
plan
and
if
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
that
is
true
and
indeed
dallas
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
well
because
if
dallas
now
wants
the
eight/three
plan
or
if
dallas
wants
the
seven/four
plan
or
indeed,
if
dallas
wants
two
single
member
districts
and
nine
members
elected
at-large,
they
are
free
to
submit
that
plan
to
the
district
court
in
the
district
of
columbia.
they
did
not
challenge
the
finding
of
unconstitutionality.
mr.
peter
buscemi
yes.
mr.
peter
buscemi
yes.
mr.
peter
buscemi
section
5
provides
that
the
city
may
not
enact
or
seek
to
administer
any
plan
not
in
effect
on
november
1,
1972.
mr.
peter
buscemi
that
is
right?
mr.
peter
buscemi
september
18,
1975.
mr.
peter
buscemi
yes,
but
indeed,
no
changes
had
been
made
since
1972.
the
at-large
elections
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
i
am
talking
about
in
dallas.
mr.
peter
buscemi
that
is
right,
if
there
have
been
changes
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
the
ones
that
were
not
in
effect
on
november
1,
1972.
mr.
peter
buscemi
has
all
of
texas
done
it
or
did
dallas
do
it?
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
we
wait
for
submissions.
mr.
peter
buscemi
that
is
right.
mr.
peter
buscemi
i
am
sure
they
have
and
i
am
sure
many
of
those
have
not
been
submitted
and
i
am
sure
that
the
attorney
general
has
not
exercised
his
right
under
the
statute
of
to
bring
a
private
enforcement
suits.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
i
do
not
think
that
the
change
in
polling
place
itself
would
be
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
i
think
that
when
section
5
was
initially
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
any
change
hereafter
by
definition
would
not
have
been
in
effect
on
november
1,
1972.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
i
am
not
sure
whether
there
were
any.
when
the
voting
rights
act
was
originally
enacted,
it
was
passed
on
august
6,
1975,
but
it
referred
to
changes
that
had
taken
place
since
november
1,
1964.
mr.
peter
buscemi
not
that
i
know
of.
mr.
peter
buscemi
i
think
that
if
there
had
been
such
a
submission,
the
attorney
general
would
have
reviewed
it
under
section
5.
i
just
want
to
comment
briefly
on
the
special
circumstances
that
were
noted
by
the
district
court.
first
of
all
those
circumstances
were
noted
in
the
context
of
an
evaluation
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
eight/three
plan.
the
district
court
never
said
that
it
was
talking
about
special
circumstances
or
unusual
situations
that
this
court
has
referred
in
speaking
of
departures
from
the
single
member
district
preference
in
court
ordered
remedies.
the
district
court
did
not
make
such
a
finding
and
indeed
the
special
circumstances
decided
by
the
district
court
in
connection
with
its
assessment
of
the
plan?s
constitutionality
are
far
different
from
the
special
circumstances
noted
by
this
court
on
the
only
occasion
when
this
court
approved
multi-member
districts
in
a
court
ordered
plan
and
that
was
in
mahan
v.
howell
where
it
had
a
very
special
situation
involving
the
norfolk
naval
base.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
i
think
that
may
very
well
make
a
difference
with
respect
to
whether
at-large
voting
is
useful
in
the
city
or
whether
it
is
constitutional.
i
do
not
think
it
should
make
a
difference
on
what
a
court
ordered
reapportionment
plan
should
involve.
i
think
that
this
court
in
chapman
v.
meier
spoke
about
the
long
time
use
of
at-large
elections
and
suggested
that
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
north
dakota.
mr.
peter
buscemi
in
the
senate,
in
the
north
dakota
senate.
the
court
did
comment,
however,
that
there
had
been
a
tradition
of
at-large,
that
are
multi
member
districts
in
the
north
dakota
house
of
representatives.
mr.
peter
buscemi
that
is
right.
mr.
peter
buscemi
that
is
right.
mr.
peter
buscemi
thank
you.
mr.
peter
buscemi
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
during
luncheon
recess
i
have
obtained
some
information
on
the
court's
question
on
the
applications
of
the
voting
rights
act
to
the
state
of
texas
and
the
changes
that
have
occurred
between
november
1972
and
september
1975.
the
attorney
general
has
received
hundreds
of
submissions
involving
such
changes
both
in
texas
itself
and
from
localities
within
the
state.
some
of
those
changes
we
are
informed,
did
involve
changes
in
polling
place
locations
to
answer
mr.
justice
brennan?s
question.
indeed,
during
the
twelve
months
immediately
following
the
application
of
the
voting
rights
act
to
texas,
more
submissions
were
received
from
that
one
state
alone.
mr.
peter
buscemi
there
are
more
of
the
other
areas
covered
under
the
act
combined.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
the
relevance
of
this
point
to
this
case
is
that
if
an
ordinance,
if
the
city
council
could
have
under
state
law
reapportioned
itself
by
ordinance
and
if
such
an
ordinance
had
been
passed
and
if
the
eight/three
plan
was
now
effective
by
virtue
of
a
city
council
ordinance,
then
that
ordinance
would
have
to
be
submitted
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
absolutely,
that
is
the
answer
to
the
chief
justice?s
question
to
the
extent
that
there
is
a
legislatively
enacted
plan
involved
here,
it
is
only
through
the
charter
amendment
that
was
passed
in
april
1976
and
that
is
what
we
argued
in
the
second
part
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
no
the
city
was
not,
but
in
connor
v.
waller
this
court
held
that
an
enacted
plan
that
just
reproduces
the
terms
of
court
ordered
plans
is
subject
to
pre-clearnace.
mr.
peter
buscemi
no,
we
are
saying
that
if
the
state
legislative
body
or
the
local
legislative
body
decides
to
adopt
what
a
court
had
ordered
into
effect
then
it
is
subject
to
pre-clearance
and
that
is
entirely
different
because
there
are
different
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
absolutely,
the
city
had
no
obligation
whatever
to
enact
the
eight/three
plan.
they
could
have
enacted
any
plan
they
wanted
and
submitted
it
to
the
district
court
of
district
columbia
or
the
attorney
general
for
pre-clearance
and
there
is
currently
pending
in
this
court
a
jurisdictional
statement
in
number
77-1376
united
states
v.
georgia
in
which
a
three
judge
court
did
consider
a
submission
of
a
change
occurring
between
november
1964
and
the
effective
date
of
the
voting
rights
act,
august
1965
and
saying
that
that
change
was
covered,
but
saying
that
it
had
been
pre-cleared.
the
issue
in
the
case
is
whether
the
attorney
general
had
pre-cleared.
thank
you.
