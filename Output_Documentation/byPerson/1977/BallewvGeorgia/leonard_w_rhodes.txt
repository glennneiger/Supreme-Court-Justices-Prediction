mr.
leonard
w.
rhodes
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
colleague
has
already
expounded
on
the
questions
involved.
i
would
go
right
into
the
five-person
jury
question
and
under
the
georgia
law
as
authoritatively
construed
in
numerous
cases.
it
has
been
held
that
all
jurors
must
return
a
unanimous
verdict
whether
that
be
a
civil
case
or
a
criminal
case
and
irrespective
of
the
size
of
the
jury.
this
means
that
in
the
case
at
bar,
the
jury
was
in
fact
charged
that
they
must
return
a
unanimous
verdict
and
that
they
must
find
all
of
the
elements
there
was
a
crime
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
so
that
this
means
that
this
jury
found
that
mr.
ballew
in
this
particular
case
participated
in
exhibition
of
this
motion
picture
that
the
film
was
in
fact
obscene.
that
he
knew
it
was
obscene
or
was
aware
of
facts
which
would
put
a
reasonable
and
prudent
person
on
notice
as
to
the
suspect
nature
of
the
film
which
under
the
georgia
law
constitutes
a
notice
and
that
he
intended
to
commit
the
crimes
on
both
occasions.
now,
how
many
jurors
are
necessary
to
a
forward
in
a
fair
trial.
as
already
has
been
discussed,
the
case
of
williams
under
the
florida,
six
was
held
to
be
sufficient
in
a
case,
a
felony
case
where
the
accused
was
charged
with
the
offense
of
robbery,
was
tried
for
the
offense
of
robbery
and
was
sentenced
to
life
in
prison.
in
the
case
at
bar
the
maximum
imprisonment
is
12
months
for
each
count
in
misdemeanor
offense.
mr.
leonard
w.
rhodes
12
months
on
each
count.
now,
in
footnote
28
of
the
majority
opinion
in
the
williams
case,
it
was
written,
we
have
no
occasion.
in
this
case,
to
determine
what
minimum
number
can
still
constitute
a
jury,
but
we
do
that
doubt
that
six
is
above
that
number.
now,
it
follows
that
if
six
is
above
the
number,
five
just
cannot
the
below
the
number.
there
is
no
number
in
between.
i
believe
--
mr.
leonard
w.
rhodes
it
was
decided
--
mr.
leonard
w.
rhodes
if
we
apply
the
williams
case
to
all
the
criminal
cases,
yes.
mr.
leonard
w.
rhodes
well,
i
am
not
familiar
with
that
your
honor.
that
may
well
be
â€“
in
georgia
the
constitution
or
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
georgia
provides
that
not
less
than
five
jurors
maybe
used
to
try
misdemeanor
cases.
the
criminal
court
of
fulton
county
and
which
in
essence
maintains
the
state
court
of
fulton
county
and
the
court
in
which
this
defendant
was
tried,
a
statute,
statute
permitted
by
the
georgia
constitution
allowed
misdemeanor
cases
to
be
tried
by
five-person
jury,
that
is
since
had
been
changed.
it
was
changed
before
this
case
was
on
appeal,
but
it
has
been
changed
and
now
the
involvement
is
in
that
court
and
i
know
of
no
other
court
in
georgia
which
has
fewer
than
six,
the
same
court.
mr.
leonard
w.
rhodes
in
this
court
it
would
be
six.
as
matter
of
fact
he
was
brought
to
trial
in
this
year
in
another
case
and
he
had
six-person
jury.
in
the
case
of
johnson
v.
louisiana
in
1972,
the
court
there
approved
the
legal
maxim
that
the
burden
of
proof
by
a
state
or
that
the
state
can
require
a
burden
of
proof
by
more
jurors
in
more
serious
cases.
in
other
words,
the
lesser
the
seriousness
of
the
offense
or
the
less
serious
punishment
by
a
smaller
jury
and
the
more
severe
cases
by
larger
jury
and
that
system
which
the
court
talked
about
and
apparently
approved,
provided
for
the
unanimous
verdict.
juries
of
five
where
less
serious
crime
were
involved,
by
a
9
or
12
where
more
severe
crimes
and
more
severe
punishment
was
involved
in
the
unanimous
verdict
or
12
in
the
most
severe
cases.
there
has
been
considerable
studies
made
in
recent
years
on
jury
size
and
rule
of
decision
and
i
would
be
the
first
admit
they
fall
on
both
sides
of
fence.
there
would
be
a
list
of
numerous
studies
which
would
be
published
this
month
and
notified
by
authors
tanky
&
tanky,
a
husband
and
wife
team
out
in
san
francisco,
mr.
tanky
being
a
lawyer
and
his
wife
being
a
psychologist,
they
have
formulated
a
annotated
latest
of
some
of
these
studies.
it
would
be
printed
by
the
american
psychological
association.
mr.
leonard
w.
rhodes
no,
your
honor.
there
are
some
already
out.
i
would
note
here
the
journal
of
personality
and
social
psychology
in
1975,
volume
32,
pages
one
through
fourteen
a
study
of
six
and
12
person
jurors
involving
unanimous
in
two-third
majority
rules
reported
to
me
the
size
and
all
rule
decision
affected
the
decision
distribution.
in
the
university
of
michigan
journal
of
law
reform
of
1973
reported
that
minority
jurors
and
six-members
juries
participated
in
more
in
the
jury
deliberations
then
did
minority
jurors
and
12-member
juries.
the
same
publication
in
a
before
and
after
study
of
a
change
from
twelve
to
six
members
juries
reported
that
there
were
substantial
similarity
in
the
results
of
the
verdict.
in
a
publication
of
jury
verdicts,
the
role
of
group
size
and
social
decisions
rule
by
michael
j.
sachs
of
boston
college,
copyrighted
this
year
and
having
been
assigned
the
library
of
congress
catalog
card
number
76-44569.
mr.
sachs
reported
that
there
were
no
significant
differences
occurring
in
the
convictions
of
quarrel
issue
or
the
proportion
of
hung
juries
as
a
function
of
jury
size,
but
he
did
report
that
a
smaller
jury
is
relied
to
any
decrease
in
the
number
of
convictions
or
that
at
least
his
studies
and
report
made
a
suggestion
that
the
smaller
juries
would
lead
to
a
decrease
in
number
of
convictions.
mr.
leonard
w.
rhodes
right
and
as
i
say
--
mr.
leonard
w.
rhodes
empirical
data,
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
am
simply
citing.
i
know
that
there
are
others
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence,
but
these
appear
to
bear
my
contention
that
a
five-member
jury
is
sufficient.
we
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
case
of
sanders
v.
georgia
which
this
court
denied
cert
on
identical
question
one
year
before
the
question
was,
a
cert
was
granted
on
the
question
in
this
case
as
reported
at
424
u.s.
393.
sanders
was
tried
in
the
same
court
with
five-person
jury,
he
appealed
and
his
cert
was
denied
on
the
question
of
scienter
and
this
is
already
been
stated.
the
georgia
requires
that
in
obscenity
cases
the
defendant
be
or
have
knowledge
of
the
obscene
nature.
the
law
further
provides
that
knowledge
can
be
actual
or
constructive
and
the
constructive
knowledge
is
either
is
knowledge
of
facts
which
would
put
a
reasonable
and
prudent
person
on
notice
of
the
suspect
nature
of
the
material.
mr.
leonard
w.
rhodes
that
is
what
the
statute
has
provided.
mr.
leonard
w.
rhodes
well,
the
georgia
law
provides
what
was
charged.
mr.
leonard
w.
rhodes
he
is
aware
of
the
type.
mr.
leonard
w.
rhodes
that
is
correct.
mr.
leonard
w.
rhodes
that
is
the
question,
yes.
the
petitioner
concedes
that
knowledge
being
required
to
be
actual
can
be
proved
by
circumstantial
evidence.
now
we
submit
--
mr.
leonard
w.
rhodes
i
agree
--
mr.
leonard
w.
rhodes
your
honor,
our
position
is
that
if
he
is
aware
of
facts
which
would
put
him
on
notice
of
the
suspect
nature
of
the
material
in
this
instance,
on
both
occasions
he
was
aware
that
he
working
in
an
adult
theater,
he
was
the
manager,
the
film
was
advertised
as
being
xxx
movie,
signs
not
to
allow
anyone
under
the
age
of
18
or
21,
i
don't
recall
the
exact
age
factor,
we
contend
that
those
are
facts
of
circumstantial
evidence
which
in
affect
warrant
the
inference
that
he
knew
that
it
was
obscene.
mr.
leonard
w.
rhodes
the
suspect
nature
of
the
material,
that
is
correct.
mr.
leonard
w.
rhodes
not
today,
i
do
not
think
it
--
mr.
leonard
w.
rhodes
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
leonard
w.
rhodes
i
take
it,
it
would
raise
a
suspicion
and
that
it
should
be
inquire,
yes.
mr.
leonard
w.
rhodes
well
--
mr.
leonard
w.
rhodes
well,
i
would
still
contend
and
submit
that
to
prove
that
would
also
prove
his
knowledge
of
the
obscenity
by
circumstantial
evidence.
mr.
leonard
w.
rhodes
it
is
here
in
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
leonard
w.
rhodes
page
a7
of
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
leonard
w.
rhodes
now,
i
would
like
just
brief
to
make
a
comparison
on
number
of
the
cases
that
mr.
clutter
has
already
mentioned,
but
in
rosen
v.
united
states
notice
of
its
contents,
notice
of
its
contents
was
held
sufficient.
in
smith
v.
california
circumstances
may
warrant
an
inference
that
he
was
aware
of
what
a
book
contained.
it
was
held
that
--
eyewitness
testimony
that
he
had
read
the
book
was
not
necessary,
but
circumstances
which
would
warrant
the
inference
said
he
was
aware
of
what
the
book
contained
despite
his
denial.
in
michigan
v.
new
york
it
was
held
that
in
some
manner
aware
was
sufficient,
in
some
manner
aware
of
the
character
of
the
material.
in
ginsberg,
reason
to
know,
reason
to
know
and
we
think
that
knowledge
of
facts
which
would
put
a
reasonable
and
prudent
person
on
notice
of
the
suspect
nature
would
be
the
same
as
reason
to
know
or
in
some
manner
aware.
mr.
leonard
w.
rhodes
reason
to
know
of
the
nature
of
the
material.
mr.
leonard
w.
rhodes
well,
these
cases
that
i
am
citing
mr.
justice
stewart
make
these
statements
that
having
notice
or
being
aware
of
the
character
of
the
material.
mr.
leonard
w.
rhodes
well,
i
fairly
see
a
great
deal
of
difference.
mr.
leonard
w.
rhodes
yes
it
does
your
honor.
case
of
california
v.
koontz
in
which
a
cert
was
denied
in
this
court.
it
is
reported
61
california
appeals
third,
page
735
had
a
similar
provision
as
determined
by
the
appellate
courts
of
california
in
that
being
aware
of
the
character
of
the
matter
was
the
required
scienter.
in
hamling
v.
united
state
it
approved
the
reasoning
in
michigan
and
ginsberg
and
that
was
in
some
manner
aware
a
reason
to
know,
reason
to
know.
to
me
reason
to
know
[laughter]
is
still
the
same
as
having
knowledge
of
facts
that
would
put
a
reasonable
and
prudent
person
on
notice.
mr.
leonard
w.
rhodes
well
--
mr.
leonard
w.
rhodes
well,
i
think
here
they
are
saying
if
he
has
reason
to
know
it
is
obscene,
if
he
has
reason
to
know.
mr.
leonard
w.
rhodes
no,
but
in
here,
in
these
cases,
if
the,
ginsberg
and
some
of
the
others
that
i
have
cited
if
he
has
reason
to
know
and
if
he
has
reason
to
know
that
it
is
suspect,
[laughter]
he
has
some
knowledge
of
it
in
either
way.
mr.
leonard
w.
rhodes
well,
if
he
has
reason
--
mr.
leonard
w.
rhodes
well,
i
might
go
one
step
further
and
say
that
he
would
be
put
on
notice
and
it
would
be
required
under
the
georgia
law
and
i
think
under
these
cases
where
it
says
reason
to
know,
but
would
be
put
on
notice
to
look
further
into
the
matter
and
to
see
it,
to
make
an
analysis
of
what
he
is
doing
and
determine
whether
not
he
should
continue
what
he
is
doing.
mr.
leonard
w.
rhodes
no
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
w.
rhodes
i
think
he
must
of
necessity
be
aware
in
some
manner
of
what
he
is
doing
that
he
has
to
have
some
intent
to
distribute,
exhibit
obscene
material.
mr.
leonard
w.
rhodes
well,
there
is
one
right
off
louisiana
that
i
can
say.
mr.
leonard
w.
rhodes
i
am
sure
there
is
others.
i
believe
it
rather
discussed
in
the
louisiana
case
or
in
a
footnote
of
plural
number,
states
mentioned
it
and
listed
to
it.
now,
the
third
question
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
film
was
obscene.
if
you
have
seen
it,
you
already
know
what
it
contains,
if
you
have
not
you
will
find
that
it
is
hardcore
pornography
under
(inaudible).
as
the
court
of
appeals
of
georgia
said
it
is
complete
with
all
sorts
of
explicit
sexual
acts.
there
is
nothing
left
to
the
imagination.
it
contains
acts
masturbation,
sexual
intercourse,
normal
and
perverted,
conalingus,
lesbianism,
anal,
sodomy.
if
it
has
been
devised,
its
contained
in
that
movie.
this
film
has
already
had
one
adjudication
of
obscenity,
at
least
one,
possibly
more.
but
in
a
civil
case
brought
in
the
northern
district
court
of
norther
district
of
texas,
judge
robert
hill
was
wrestling
with
the
problem
of
whether
or
not
it
was
obscene
in
copyright.
mr.
leonard
w.
rhodes
i
have
no
further.
i
would
be
willing
to
waive.
mr.
leonard
w.
rhodes
if
i
may
in
conclusion
say
that
we
ask
the
court
to
reaffirm
that
obscene
material
is
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
we
ask
that
the
court
view
this
and
rule
that
it
is
obscene.
it
has
been
so
ruled
on
three
occasions
and
the
trial
court
in
this
case,
by
the
appellate
court,
court
of
appeals
of
georgia
and
by
the
northern
district
court
of
texas
and
that
you
make
it
plain
to
those
people
in
this
country
that
would
deal
in
this
matter
that
they
do
so
at
the
risk
of
being
prosecuted
in
the
applicable
state
in
federal
jurisdictions.
thank
you.
