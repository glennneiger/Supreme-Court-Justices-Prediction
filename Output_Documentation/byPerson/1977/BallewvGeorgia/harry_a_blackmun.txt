blackmun
the
sixth
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
reads
at
its
beginning
thusly.
in
all
criminal
prosecutions,
the
accused
shall
enjoy
the
right
to
a
speedy
and
public
trial.
in
1968
this
court
held
the
sixth
amendment
was
applicable
to
the
states.
and
they
that
provision
for
an
impartial
jury
applied
in
non-
petty
state
criminal
cases.
eight
years
ago
in
a
case
called
in
williams
against
florida,
this
court
ruled
that
the
constitutional
sixth
amendment
guarantee
of
trail
by
jury
in
a
criminal
case,
does
not
require
that
a
state
jury's
membership
be
fixed
to
twelve.
it
concluded
instead
that
a
defendant
sixth
amendment
rights
as
applied
to
the
states
through
the
fourteenth
amendment
were
not
violated
by
a
florida
statute
providing
for
a
six
person
jury,
rather
than
a
twelve
person
jury
in
criminal
cases
other
than
capital
cases.
and
that
defendants
forwarded
conviction
therefore
affirmed.
the
present
case
brings
the
next
step.
it
comes
to
us
by
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
georgia.
the
petitioner
mr.
ballew
was
the
owner
of
an
adult
theater
in
atlanta.
he
was
charged
under
a
georgia
statute
with
distributing
obscene
materials
and
he
was
brought
to
trial
in
the
criminal
court
of
fulton
county,
atlanta.
the
jury
of
five
was
selected
and
sworn,
petitioner
moved
immediately
for
a
jury
of
12
persons.
the
georgia
constitution
and
the
statute
dating
way
back
to
1891,
provided
that
in
that
particular
court
in
fulton
county,
adjuring
a
criminal
case
would
consist
of
five
persons.
and
parenthetically
that
number
has
not
been
increased
to
six
effective
in
march
of
1976.
the
petitioner's
motion
for
a
12
person
jury
was
overruled
and
he
was
convicted.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
and
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
denied
review.
we
however
granted
certiorari
to
consider
among
others
a
five
person
jury
issue.
so
we
are
presented
with
the
distinction
between
6
persons
in
william
against
florida
and
five
persons
in
the
present
case.
we
adhere
to
the
rule
of
williams
against
florida.
and
one
might
therefore
ask
whether
and
how
one
could
draw
a
distinction
between
six
persons
on
the
one
hand
and
five
person
on
the
other.
or
for
that
matter
four
and
three
and
two
and
one.
by
way
of
flurry
of
opinions
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
the
court
holds
that
the
five
member
jury
does
not
satisfied
the
jury
trial
guarantee
of
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendments
and
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
court
of
appeals
of
georgia.
all
members
of
the
court
agree
as
to,
the
reversal.
there
is
however
as
often
seems
to
be
the
case,
at
least
where
i
am
writing,
there
is
no
opinion
subscribed
by
a
majority
of
the
court.
i
have
filed
an
opinion
joined
and
i
am
grateful
by
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
justice
stevens
however
is
gone
on
to
file
a
concurring
statement.
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
a
statement
concurring
on
the
judgments.
he
was
the
author
of
williams
against
florida
the
six
person
jury
case.
mr.
justice
powell
has
filed
an
opinion
also
concurring
on
the
judgment
and
is
joined
there
by
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
short
separate
opinion,
agreeing
with
the
court's
holding
as
to
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendment
issue,
but
not
agreeing
that
petitioner
maybe
subjected
to
a
new
trial
incidentally,
we
do
not,
because
of
the
holding
on
the
5%
jury
issue
did
not
reach
the
other
issues
as
to
obscenity
and
constitutionality
there.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
joined
in
that
opinion
by
mr.
justice
stewart
and
mr.
justice
marshall
and
i
think
that
covers
the
names
and
numbers
of
all
of
the
players.
but
the
result
is
that
the
case
is
reversed
and
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
the
judgment
of
the
court.
