unknown
speaker
because
not
an
appropriate
representative
of
the
cross
section
of
the
community?
unknown
speaker
well
it
just
suggests
mr.
clutter
that
bench
trials
will
be
inappropriate
for
the
determination
of
obscenity,
a
single
judge
cannot?
unknown
speaker
what
if
he
did
not?
unknown
speaker
well
do
not
you
have
bench
trials
and
judge
it
--
that
the
determination
of
obscenity
not
in
a
criminal
case,
but
in
some
kind
of
civil
cases?
unknown
speaker
what
about
that?
would
a
single
judge
able
to
determine
obscenity?
unknown
speaker
and
you
do
not
think
they
will
present
any
first
amendment
problem?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
am
talking
about
a
civil
case?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
there
is
at
least
one
dissent
in
this
court,
kinsley
books.
back
in
the
1956
or
1957,
that
was
a
civil
case.
unknown
speaker
it
was
suggested
that
the
determination
of
obscenity
was
always
the,
bench
trial
or
otherwise,
by
a
jury
because
of
its
function
as
cross
section
of
community.
as
far
as
i
know
that
idea
as
not
caught
on?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
that
brother
rehnquist
is
right
because
at
least,
i
forget
whether
it
was
concurrence
or
dissent,
did
address
it,
but
it
was
not
raised.
unknown
speaker
as
decided
by
the
court?
unknown
speaker
are
you
asking
that
williams
v.
florida
be
overruled?
unknown
speaker
well,
thought
it
was
of
a
suspect
content?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
quite
important
that
the
charge
was
that
the
constructive
knowledge
was
to
be
of
this
suspect
quality,
not
of
the
obscene
quality.
therefore
is
your
argument
based
upon
that?
unknown
speaker
were
those
the
instructions
to
the
jury?
unknown
speaker
the
suspect
nature?
unknown
speaker
where
are
the
instructions
here?
unknown
speaker
alright.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
mr.
clutter
i
got
lost.
you
are
reading
from
page
11
of
what?
unknown
speaker
so
the
instruction
was,
was
it
not
that
he
was
charged
with
constructive
knowledge
that
the
material
is
obscene,
if
there
was
enough
information
to
put
a
reasonable
and
prudent
man
on
notice
that
this
material
was
simply
suspect.
unknown
speaker
we
do
not
see
them
in
your
brief,
except
for
in
your
oral
argument
make
much
of
and
unless
i
misunderstood
you,
the
use
of
the
word
suspect?
unknown
speaker
are
even
constructive
knowledge
that
is
obscene,
but
only
constructive
knowledge
that
it
is
suspect?
unknown
speaker
which
is
quite
a
different
word
from
obscene,
it
means
quite
a
different
thing?
unknown
speaker
that
fact
that
this
petitioner
had
been
arrested
a
couple
of
times
for
showing
this
film?
unknown
speaker
which
one
of
those
arrested
before
as
today?
unknown
speaker
mr.
clutter,
do
i
understand
you
to
take
the
position
that
if
the
defendant
can
honestly
testify
he
never
saw
the
movie,
just
avoided
seeing
it,
is
he
allowed
have
a
defense?
unknown
speaker
one
other
question
mr.
clutter,
you
explained
why
michigan
and
hamling
are
not
in
point.
what's
the
strongest
case
supporting
your
position
on
the
scienter
issue?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
sentence
in
the
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
might
be,
it
should
have
been
decided
then,
should
it
not,
i
mean,
you
say
then
this
question
was
decided?
unknown
speaker
right
then
and
there.
unknown
speaker
but
the
court
may
decide
the
question
was
open,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well
that
is
–
that
is
--
that
removes
at
one
stage,
does
it
not?
this
jury
was
instructed
under
the
statute
as
i
understand
it,
correctly
instructed
for
as
the
statute
wants,
that
a
person
has
knowledge
of
the
obscene
content
of
the
material.
if
he
has
constructive
knowledge
of
a
suspect
nature
of
the
material.
that
is
two
big
steps,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
not
if
he
had
constructive
knowledge
of
the
obscene
nature
of
the
material,
but
if
he
has,
he
was
instructed
a
--
he
knows
what
the
material
is
if
he
has
reason
to
know
that
it
is
suspect,
not
that
he
has
reason
to
know
what
it
is?
unknown
speaker
i
know
that
and
so
the
--
unknown
speaker
the
instructions
were
in
court
with
the
georgia
statute.
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
says
whether
or
not
that
is
a
sufficient
instruction
to
deal
with
first
amendment,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
but
this
jury
was
instructed
that
he
knew
it
was
obscene,
if
he
had
constructive
knowledge,
not
that
it
was
obscene,
but
it
was
suspect?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
two
certainly
have
different
meanings,
those
two
words,
are
they
not,
even
in
this
context?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
the
jurors
are
instructed,
they
could
and
should
find
him
guilty
if
he
had
reason
to
know
it
was
suspect
and
if
it
is
something
suspect,
it
may
or
may
not
be
obscene.
the
jury
was
instructed
that
it
would
have
find
that
he
knew
it
was
obscene
if
he
had
simply
reason
to
know
that
it
was
suspect.
unknown
speaker
mr.
rhodes,
supposing
that
he
knew
that
the
name
of
the
film
was
“carnal
knowledge,”
that
would
satisfy
the
intent
requirement
under
the
statute
even
though
the
film
in
fact
is
not
obscene,
would
it
not,
is
that
what
put
him
on
notice
it
is
suspect?
unknown
speaker
before
this
court's
decision
in
holding
it
was
not
obscene,
he
should
then
by
just
knowing
that
was
the
name
of
the
film,
they
would
put
him
on
notice,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
think
this,
would
it
not
that
raise
a
suspicion,
do
you
think
that
would
make
a
man
suspicious
that
it
might
be
obscene?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
not
exactly
what
the
statute
requires,
just
exactly
there?
if
he
has
knowledge
of
the
fact,
namely
it
is
name
is
“carnal
knowledge”
which
would
put
a
reasonable
prudent
man
on
notice
of
the
suspect
nature
of
the
material?
unknown
speaker
and
under
the
statute
and
under
the
instructions
then
the
jury
is
told
to
convict
him?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
not
being
aware
that
the
material
is
suspect.[laughter]
unknown
speaker
mr.
rhodes
does
the
same
statute
government
applied
to
both
the
bookstores
and
motion
pictures?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
has
the
reason
to
know
what.
let
us
assume
to
take
a
ridiculous
case
that
your
legislature
said
--
it
should
say
that
if
you
have
reason
to
know
that
a
book
contains
paper
and
printing
on
it
then
that
is
constructive
knowledge
that
its
obscene
and
that
clearly
would
be
wholly
irrational
and
invalid
law
under
the
first
amendment?
unknown
speaker
now,
they
do
not
say
and
here
they
say
if
you
have
reason
to
know
it
is
suspect
then
you
know
it
is
obscene.
they
do
not
say
if
you
have
reason
to
know
it
is
obscene
then
you
know
it
is
obscene.
unknown
speaker
if
the
instructions
did
not
say
that
in
statute,
it
does
not
say
--
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
suspect.
if
he
has
know
it
is
suspect,
he
has
constructive
knowledge
that
it
is
suspect?
unknown
speaker
these
instructions
did
not
say
that.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
one
other
question
on
this
subject.
do
you
think
if
georgia
had
a
law
that
said
a
man
is
absolutely
viable
for
distributing
obscene
material,
if
it
is
in
fact
obscene
regardless
of
whether
he
had
knowledge
whatsoever
about
its
contents
and
that
would
be
consistent
with
the
first
amendment?
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
think.
unknown
speaker
i
am
sorry,
i
had
one
other
question
too
on
your
five-man
or
five-person
jury
point.
are
there
other
states,
how
many
other
states
have
five-person
juries
of
which
you
aware,
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
only
one,
yes.
unknown
speaker
mr.
clutter
if
you
went
on
any
one
of
your
issues
as
you
need
the
court
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
how
about
jury
–
how
about
the
jury?
unknown
speaker
what
would
happen
if
we
just
decided
that
the
movie
was
obscene?
unknown
speaker
then
we
have
to
reach
other
questions
--
unknown
speaker
would
you
have
a
retrial?
unknown
speaker
yes.
