chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
some
of
the
76-761
ballew
against
georgia.
mr.
clutter,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no
inconvenience,
it
is
to
the
court
at
all.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
are
suggesting
that
this
claim
about
a
less
than
12
jury
is
focussed
just
in
first
amendment
cases,
is
that
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
you
make
that
argument
equally,
to
the
effect
that
24
would
be
more
constitutional
even
though
we
have
never
used
24
member
juries.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
not
sure
either.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
are
saying
it
is
not
constitutionally
you
use
less
than
12
in
the
first
amendment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
talking
about
--
it
had
cases
from
georgia
precisely
of
that
kind.
a
judge,
trial
and
determination
of
obscenity
for
purposes
other
than
criminal?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
in
such
case
in
almost
any
state
a
nuisance
case
addressed
to
at
an
equity
court,
it
would
not
very
likely
be
a
single
judge
enjoining
the
display
of
the
film
or
a
book,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
notice
in
your
brief,
you
have
described
this
film
as
a
nationally
acclaimed
movie
that
suggest
some
awareness
by
somebody
of
what
the
movie
was
all
about
or
would
your
answer
to
that
be
that
he
did
not
take
a
look
at
the
movie
until
after
the
case
was
brought?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
would
be
further
relying
on
heresy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
rhodes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
we
will
resume
there
at
one
o'clock
counsel
if
you
have
any
further.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
clutter
so
you
have
anything
further?
have
you
submitted
counsel.
yes
you
have
some
time
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
clutter
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
he
is
retried,
he
is
automatically
tried
before
a
six
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
of
the
court
in
ballew
against
georgia
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
blackmun.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
