mr.
michael
clutter
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
first
of
all
i
would
like
to
apologize
both
on
my
own
behalf
and
on
behalf
of
mr.
smith
for
the
lateness
of
the
motion
which
allowed
me
to
argue
this
case.
mr.
smith
is
involved
in
another
matter
and
it
was
only
at
the
end
of
last
week
it
became
apparent
that,
that
might
interfere
with
argument
here.
i
apologize
again
for
the
lateness
of
that
and
for
any
inconvenience
that
may
caused
the
court.
mr.
michael
clutter
thank
you
sir.
this
case
involves
a
conviction
from
the
state
courts
of
state
of
georgia
of
two
counts
of
distributing
obscene
material.
the
two
counts
are
both
predicated
upon
the
same
material
and
involves
two
exhibitions
of
the
film,
“behind
the
green
door,”
in
the
same
theater
on
two
different
dates.
the
petitioner
was
tried
on
these
two
different
counts
before
a
five-person
jury
pursuant
to
the
authority
of
a
georgia
constitutional
provision,
which
we
challenge
here.
he
was
convicted.
the
judgment
of
conviction
was
affirmed
in
georgia
court
of
appeals
and
the
opinion
in
judgment
which
we
challenge
here.
there
are
three
arguments
on
this
petition
for
certiorari.
i
think
in
our
candor
that
only
two
of
them
are
susceptible
to
any
elucidation
on
oral
argument.
the
third
question
relates
to
the
obscenity
well
known
of
the
films
involved
in
this
case.
we
certainly
do
not
abandon
that
argument
or
anyway
retreat
from
it,
but
i
do
not
think
that
could
really
be
expounded
upon
much
in
oral
argument.
we
submit
that
question
on
the
argument
submitted
in
the
brief
and
i
would
not
choose
to
present
any
oral
argument
on
the
unless
the
court
asked
me
any
specific
questions.
the
other
two
questions
involved
are
the
five-person
jury,
the
constitutionality
of
the
five-person
jury
before
whom
the
petitioner
was
tried
and
the
constitutionality
of
the
jury
instructions
which
allowed
a
conviction
on
the
basis
of
not
only
actual
knowledge
of
the
materials,
but
constructive
knowledge
of
the
materials.
the
five-person
jury
question
was
one
which
was
specifically
reserved
by
this
court;
five-persons
or
less
was
specifically
reserved
by
this
court
in
williams
v.
florida
which
approved
a
six-person
jury
and
said
that
do
not
violate
the
sixth
amendment
right
as
applied
to
the
states
to
the
fourteenth,
reserving
the
question
of
whether
any
lesser
number
might
so
violate
it.
as
is
argued
in
a
brief,
i
think
there
is
just
one
point
that
needs
emphasis
in
this
case
which
differentiates
it
from
cases
like
williams
and
that
is
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
determination
of
obscenity
and
we
are
concerned
in
this
case
as
not
only
with
whether
a
five-person
jury
as
equally
able
to
determine
guilt
or
innocence
as
a
six
or
as
a
twelve-person,
but
whether
a
five-person
jury
is
equally
as
able
to
delineate
the
applicable
community
standards
in
the
determination
of
obscenity.
i
think
that
the
sensitive
first
amendment
arguments
here
differentiates
this
case
from
those
like
williams
that
those
are
not
the
values
upon
which
this
argument
is
predicated,
but
i
think
they
are
a
separate
and
distinct
line
of
argument.
mr.
michael
clutter
i
am
suggesting
alternative
arguments
to
support
the
petitioner's
position,
your
honor,
that
even
if
the
court
were
to
find
that
the
five-person
juries
might
be
constitutionally
acceptable
as
a
sixth
amendment
matter
in
cases
not
involving
the
first
amendment,
that
it
should
find
that
the
five-person
jury
is
not
constitutionally
acceptable
in
first
amendment
cases,
involving
a
determination
of
community
standards.
mr.
michael
clutter
that
is
correct
your
honor,
that
position
is
spouseless
pursuant
to
this
court's
--
mr.
michael
clutter
i
do
not
know
if
more
constitutional
would
be
the
appropriate
word
to
describe
that.
mr.
michael
clutter
i
think
--
mr.
michael
clutter
we
are
submitting
the
argument
that
it
is
not
constitutional
to
use
less
than
12
in
first
amendment
case
in
the
event
that
the
court
finds
that
argument
without
merit
that
the
drop
in
the
number
from
6
to
5
is
even
more
important
than
even
--
and
even
more
a
suspect
in
a
first
amendment
case
than
it
would
be
in
another
case.
mr.
michael
clutter
your
honor
it
should,
if
the
defendant
in
focus
right
to
a
jury
trial,
we
would
most
surely
submit
--
mr.
michael
clutter
if
he
did
not,
he
certainly
has
the
right
to
submit
determination
of
his
guilt
or
innocence
to
a
single
judge.
mr.
michael
clutter
yes
sir.
mr.
michael
clutter
yes
sir,
pursuant
to
civil
statutes
in
present
georgia
is
a
single
judge.
mr.
michael
clutter
i
think
it
does
your
honor,
but
it
have
to
admit
that
it
--
mr.
michael
clutter
in
the
civil
proceedings
even
without
a
waiver
i
believe,
although
i
cannot
state
with
certainly
that
it
is
possible
to,
over
a
civil
defendant's
objections
to
try
a
obscenity
case
before
a
judge
and
not
before
a
jury.
mr.
michael
clutter
your
honor,
the
only
case
i
know
of
in
that
regard,
there
were
cases
here,
is
paris
adult
theater
v.
slaton.
in
that
particular
case
which
robert
smith
did
argue
before
the
court,
i
believe
the
defendant
waived
his
right
to
jury
trial.
i
am
not
sure
if,
i
am
not
positive
and
i
do
not
want
to
state
that
as
a
fact,
but
i
believe
that
in
that
case
it
was,
i
guess
in
the
nature
what
we
call
a
test
case,
he
wanted
to
determine
the
constitutionality
--
mr.
michael
clutter
most
probably
your
honor.
i
know
of
no
nuisance
statue
that
is
still
--
that
held
constitutional,
the
nuisance
statute
we
have
in
georgia
as
applied
to
obscenity
has
been
held
unconstitutional
by
the
georgia
supreme
court
and
i
think
that
nuisance
statue
thus
applied
to
first
amendment
materials
have
met
a
similar
fate
in
all
the
other
states
that
i
know
of.
i
do
not
know
of
any
that
remains.
i
know
they
have
been
struck
down
in
michigan,
kentucky,
indiana,
illinois,
colorado,
california,
nebraska
perhaps
other
states.
i
do
not
know
again
whether
juries
were
available
in
those
other
jurisdictions.
all
i
know
is
under
georgia
i
think
that
perhaps
a
single
judge
could
determine
even
over
defendant's
objection
that
that
statute
is
no
longer
in
existence.
mr.
michael
clutter
yes
sir.
mr.
michael
clutter
yes
sir.
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
argument
has
taken
on
more
significance
post
miller
with
the
determination
by
this
court
that
it
is
not
a
national
community
standards
which
perhaps
one
person
could
as
easily
guess
at
as
a
group
of
6
or
even
12
from
a
local
community,
and
when
standard
has
been
replaced
by
a
standard
of
the
local
community
and
especially
with
this
court's
ruling
that
no
evidence
on
those
community
standards
need
to
be
submitted.
the
juries
bring
that
into
the
jury
room
with
them.
they
live
in
the
community
and
they
bring
their
own
knowledge
of
the
community
standards
to
the
room
with
them.
with
that
standard
being
applicable
as
opposed
to
some
national
standards
which,
they
might
only
give
evidence
on
or
guess
on,
i
think
that
a
root
deliberation
is
really
more
important
even
more
constitutionally
mandated.
mr.
michael
clutter
i
do
not
believe
that
question
was
addressed
to
mckinney.
i
think
that
the
mckinney
dealt
only
with
the
applicability
of
a
civil
determination
to
a
another
litigant.
mr.
michael
clutter
no
sir.
mr.
michael
clutter
so
far
as
i
know
mckinney
dealt
only
with
the
applicability
of
determination
of
obscenity
of
criminal
litigant
later
and
foreclosing
that
question
became
in
a
later
criminal
obscenity
case.
the
court
in
its
enunciation
in
williams
did
not
make
any
or
did
not
focus
upon
or
decide
the
case
on
the
basis
of
historical
analysis,
but
instead
examined
the
purposes
of
the
right
to
trial
by
jury.
and
as
is
submitted
in
brief
i
believe
that
in
light
of
those
purposes,
both
as
to
the
determination
of
guilt
or
innocence
of
this
defendant
and
as
to
the
determination
of
community
standards
in
the
first
amendment
area
that
the
decrease
from
6
to
5
or
indeed
from
12
to
5,
since
this
is
a
first
time
that
a
first
amendment
issue
had
been
presented,
is
constitutionally
suspect,
if
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
as
i
said
in
williams
are
safeguard
against
an
over-jealous
or
a
corrupt
prosecutor
and
it
separates
the
defendant
from
a
compliant
biased
or
eccentric
judge.
i
think
that
those
values
are
little
served
if
the
complaint
or
corrupt
biased
or
eccentric
judges
only
replaced
by
such
a
jury
and
i
think
that
the
slippery
slope
argument
which
is
recognized
in
footnote-22
is
squarely
presented
to
you
and
i
just
ask
your
honors
to
hold
that
the
time
has
reached
to
get
off
the
slippery
slope
as
the
court
suggested
that
it
would
do
at
the
appropriate
time
in
that
footnote.
mr.
michael
clutter
no
sir.
i
do
not
think
it
is
necessary
to
overrule
williams
v.
florida.
i
think
that
there
are
two
alternative
grounds
for
this
particular
question;
either
to
hold
that
williams
is
inapplicable
as
applied
to
first
amendment
cases
where
pursuant
to
miller
or
jury
determination
of
community
standards
must
be
made.
i
think
that
even
with
williams'
extent,
the
court
might
really
hold
that
the
further
step
down
the
slope
that
was
recognized
in
that
case
from
6
to
5
is
inappropriate,
but
it
is
certainly
not
necessary
in
either
instances,
under
either
arguments
submitted
by
this
petitioner
to
overrule
williams.
the
other
question
presented
relates
to
the
constitutionally
accepted
minimum
standard
of
scienter
in
obscenity
cases.
this
question
arises
because
the
judge
instructed
the
jury
in
this
case
pursuant
to
georgia
statute
that
the
defendant
could
only
be
convicted
for
knowing
distribution
of
obscene
material,
that
knowing
in
this
context,
and
these
are
the
other
words
of
the
statute,
includes
both
actual
and
constructive
knowledge
and
a
person
has
constructive
knowledge
if
he
has
knowledge
of
facts
or
circumstances
that
will
put
a
reasonable
person
on
notice
as
to
a
suspect
--
mr.
michael
clutter
yes
sir,
that
is
again
from
the
wording
of
the
statute.
it
says
the
scienter
requirement
in
georgia
and
under
the
statute
is
worded
as
either
actual
or
constructive
knowledge
of
the
obscene
content.
mr.
michael
clutter
well,
your
honor
under
the
wording
of
the
statute
and
that
is
set
forth
in
the
appendix,
it
is
stated
that
the
constructive
knowledge
is
knowledge
of
facts
or
circumstances
or
places
or
--
i
am
sorry
your
honor
it
is
not
in
the
appendix,
but
the
wording
of
it.
mr.
michael
clutter
yes
sir.
the
knowledge
--
both
the
constructive
knowledge
of
the
obscene
content
and
of
the
suspect
nature
of
the
material
is
set
forth
in
the
words
in
the
statute.
what
statue
says
is
that
one
must
have
knowledge
of
the
obscene
content
of
the
material
as
a
term
of
art
--
mr.
michael
clutter
your
honor,
the
instructions
to
the
jury
were
that,
that
element
could
be
met.
mr.
michael
clutter
no
your
honor,
the
element
of
knowledge
of
the
obscene
content
of
the
material
mr.
michael
clutter
your
honor
it
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
11.
mr.
michael
clutter
that
the
word
knowing
as
used
in
the
statute
is
actually
a
constructive
knowledge
of
the
obscene
content,
but
that
element
could
be
met
merely
by
showing
knowledge
of
facts
or
circumstances
that
will
put
a
reasonable
person
on
notice
as
to
the
suspect
nature
of
the
material.
mr.
michael
clutter
so
that
it
is
part
goes
to
the
actual
and
the
constructive
knowledge
standard.
mr.
michael
clutter
the
brief
of
the
petitioner
your
honor.
it
is
at
the
bottom
of
page
11
and
beginning
12,
it
is
beginning
of
that
argument
set
forth
in
the
brief.
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
michael
clutter
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
they
are
allow
to
convict
him
on
that
basis
and
again
that
is
the
wording
of
the
statue
that
--
mr.
michael
clutter
your
honor
i
think
in
light
of
this
court's
decision
in
hamling
i
think
that
all
that
the
georgia
statute
means
in
that
the
defendant
need
not
have
knowledge
of
the
legal
status
of
the
material
as
obscene
and
we
do
not
submit
that
you
need
one.
mr.
michael
clutter
yes
sir.
mr.
michael
clutter
yes
sir.
all
i
wish
to
state
and
the
reason
that
particular
element
was
not
stressed
in
the
brief
is
that
the
petitioner
does
not
here
contend
that
he
must
constitutionally
be
found
to
have
had
knowledge
of
the
legal
status
of
the
material
as
obscene
and
that
ignorance
of
the
law
or
the
failure
to
brush
up
on
the
law
of
obscenity
would
not
protect
him,
that
he
must
merely
found
to
have
knowledge
of
the
content
of
the
material
and
that
it
falls
within
the
classification
that
it
might
be
obscene.
but
what
the
petitioner
asserts
in
this
case
is
that
he
must
have
actual
knowledge
of
those
materials,
not
merely
that
he
finds
himself
in
the
circumstance
where
a
jury
might
conclude
that
someone
else
should
have
taken
further
inquiry.
mr.
michael
clutter
your
honor
yes,
in
the
sense
that
the
basic
thrust
of
this
argument
is
one
of
the
chilling
effect.
i
think
that
the
chilling
effect
in
the
distribution
of
the
books
would
be
even
greater
because
of
the
longer
time
required
for
the
cautious
bookseller
to
familiarize
himself
with
this
material
then
for
a
cautious
movie
previewer
to
sell
movies.
however,
i
am
not
aware
of
the
factual
circumstances
under
which
movies
are
distributed.
mr.
michael
clutter
some
movie
theaters
i
guess
with
the
possibility
of
double
features
in
the
multiple
theaters
that
i
assume
are
present
here
may
have
6
to
12
movies
at
any
given
time,
but
the
chilling
effect
argument
as
put
forth
by
this
petitioner
would
relate
not
to
his
exhibition
of
the
film,
but
his
original
selection
of
it.
if
a
man
is
sitting
in
atlanta
and
is
trying
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
order
a
film
to
show
in
his
theater,
a
film
with
a
title
such
as
“carnal
knowledge”
which
your
honors
are
aware
because
jenkins
v.
george
be
might
well
under
this
statute
not
even
ordered
that
film
unless
he
has
a
chance
to
see
it
and
he
might
not
have
a
chance
to
see
it
before
he
orders
it
and
if
under
this
statute
he
is
worried
that
mere
presence
of
that
title
would
make
him
susceptible
to
the
criminal
prosecutions,
then
he
might
well
refrain
from
ordering
that
film
and
exhibiting
at
his
community
and
thus
deprive
those
members
of
his
community
of
a
chance
to
see
that
film
merely
because
that
title
might
later
be
held
by
a
jury
to
put
him
where
he
a
reasonable
and
prudent
man
on
notice
as
to
some
suspect
nature
of
the
material.
so
that
it
may
approve
before
he
even
orders
the
material.
mr.
michael
clutter
your
honor,
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
when
he
took
the
accountability
if
we
would
go
outside
the
record,
i
could
submit
as
a
member
of
the
court
as
he
did
not
in
fact
now
look
at
it,
but
i
do
not
think
that
is
important
to
this
decision.
it
was
nationally
acclaimed
in
the
same
way
that
“carnal
knowledge”
was
nationally
acclaimed,
that
any
individual
defendant
may
not
have
seen
that
material
or
have
been
made
aware
of
the
circumstances
that
might
later
be
held
to
put
him
on
notice
to
--
mr.
michael
clutter
it
is
relying
on
heresy
as
to
the
general
course
of
the
film.
it
certainly
was
not,
again,
i
am
not
even
sure
how
specific
that
heresy
was.
the
national
acclaim
of
this
film
certainly
did
not
arise
until
after
it
had
been
exhibited
for
some
time
and
whether
that
was
present
at
the
time
he
ordered
the
film,
i
am
not
sure,
but
even
if
it
was,
it
was
not
specific
enough,
i
would
submit
to
satisfy
the
constitutional
minimum
standards
of
the
scienter
even
if
he
was
aware
of
that
--
that
heresy..
mr.
michael
clutter
your
honor
yes,
this
conviction,
excuse
me
this
case
involves
two
different
accounts,
distributing
the
film;
the
first
on
november
9th
of
1973
and
the
2nd
on
november
27th
1973,
those
were
couple
of
weeks
apart
as
the
film;
after
his
first
arrest,
was
continued
to
be
shown
and
he
was
in
the
theater
and
under
the
prosecutions
theory
he
was
a
manager
of
the
theater
during
that
period
of
time
and
comes
in
both
of
those
dates.
mr.
michael
clutter
both
of
them
your
honor.
they
were
combined
for
a
joint
trial.
he
was
arrested.
he
was
sentenced
to
one
year
under
each
count
that
those
sentences
were
driven
concurrently.
he
was
fined,
however,
1000$
on
each
count,
so
that
we
have
a
punishment
attaching
to
each
count
separately
as
it
relates
to
the
fines,
not
as
it
relates
to
the
time
to
be
served
however.
the
prosecutor
has
submitted
in
his
brief
that
this
question
has
already
been
answered
by
the
this
court
and
i
think
i
would
just
like
to
state
briefly
why
i
think
it
has
not.
his
main
reliance
is
upon
michigan
v.
new
york
and
ginsberg
v.
new
york
that
involved
two
different
new
york
obscenity
statues.
the
first
of
those
was
michigan
v.
new
york
that
involved
a
question
about
the
petitioner
very
similar
to
the
question
presented
here,
asked
this
court
to
delineate
the
constitutionally
acceptable
minimum
standard
of
scienter
because
of
the
very
wording
of
the
statute
there
which
was
section
1411
of
the
new
york
statute
was
fairly
similar
in
authorizing
convictions
on
the
basis
of
constructive
knowledge.
however,
before
that
issue
was
addressed
by
this
court,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
decided
people
v.
finkelstein
which
is
cited
in
this
court's
opinion
in
michigan
and
the
people
v.
finkelstein
decided
that
limited
the
scienter
requirement
to
what
this
court
described
as
a
very
stringent
element
of
scienter
and
required
knowledge
and
those
who
were
accused,
only
those
were
in
some
manner
aware
of
the
character,
not
should
be
aware,
not
were
aware
of
facts
and
circumstances
to
put
them
on
notice,
but
were
aware
of
the
content,
i
mean,
of
the
character
of
the
material
are
subject
to
prosecution
and
it
is
aim
thus
not
an
innocent,
even
stupidly
innocent,
but
calculated
prevalence
of
a
film.
with
that
limitation
on
the
statute
upon
section
1411
of
the
new
york
penal
code,
this
court
did
not
reach
and
specifically
says
at
page
511
of
its
opinion,
it
does
not
have
to
reach
the
constitutional
minimum
that
this
statute
has
limited
in
this
way
to
those
who
have
knowledge
is
clearly
constitutionally
acceptable.
that
same
result
was
reached
in
ginsberg
v.
new
york
a
couple
years
later
that
involved
section
484
of
the
new
york
penal
code.
the
only
difference
from
that
and
the
original
in
michigan
case
was,
484
dealt
with
distribution
of
material
which
although
not
obscene
when
judged
against
standard
of
adults,
was
obscene
when
judged
against
the
standard
of
its
appeal
to
children.
it
was
specifically
addressed
to
what
today
might
be
called
child
porn
or
material
which
might
appeal
to
children.
that
had
a
scienter
requirement
again
very
similar
to
that
before
this
court,
that
was
at
knowingly
means
knowledge
or
reason
to
know,
belief
for
ground
for
belief.
so
i
would
admit
that
is
very
similar
to
the
standard
here.
again,
that
question
was
not
reached
in
ginsberg
because
again
the
people
v.
finkelstein
gloss
on
the
statute
was
held
by
this
court
to
require
under
that
gloss
that
actual
knowledge,
those
who
are
in
some
manner
aware
of
the
character
of
the
material
were
subject
to
prosecution.
with
that
gloss
this
again
the
court
again
states
at
page
644
and
645
in
its
opinion,
it
is
not
necessary
to
decide
whether
or
not
a
constructive
knowledge
requirement
is
sufficient
because
in
this
case
there
was
an
actual
knowledge
requirement.
thus
neither
of
those
cases
reach
that
issue.
the
only
other
case
cited
by
the
solicitor
in
support
of
his
his
position
in
this
regard
is
rosen
v.
united
states,
a
19th
century
prosecution
under
the
federal
statutes
and
in
which
the
court
said
the
issue
was
“whether
a
paper
which
was
mailed
as
obscene,
lewd,
insidious
and
whether
it
was
deposited
in
the
mails
by
one
who
knew
or
had
notice
of
its
content.
i
think,
however,
taking
in
context
if
you
read
on
from
the
quotation
in
the
case
which
is
cited
by
the
solicitor,
the
following
phrase
is
that
thus
someone
can
be
convicted
even
though
he
did
not
regard
it
as
forbidden.
i
think
all
this
really
is
in
rosen
is
statement
that
was
repeated
by
this
court
in
hamling
that
one
need
not
be
aware
of
the
legal
status
of
material
as
obscene
and
i
just
wish
to
repeat
the
petitioner
here
does
not
support
that
position
and
does
not
suggested
that
this
is
even
necessary
to
support
him
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
clutter
no
sir,
as
stated
in
here
we
admit
two
things.
of
course
the
state
certainly
has
the
right
to
prove
knowledge
on
the
basis
of
circumstantial
evidence
and
as
this
court
said
in
smith
that
the
judicial
process
and
its
ability
to
ascertain
prove
this
not
foreclosed
by
someone's
denial
that
may
will
be
that
the
jury
could
find
that
the
defendant
knew
the
contents
of
the
film
whether
he
saw
or
not.
all
we
submit
is
that
knowledge
has
to
be
actual
or
has
to
be
actual
rather
than
constructive
knowledge.
i
think
that
people
know
a
great
many
things
without
seeing
them
and
may
know
the
content
of
material
and
thus
someone
who
purposely
for
instance,
purposely
refuses
to
view
films
before
showing
them
could
well
be
held
by
a
jury
to
say
that
the
reason
he
refused
to
look
at
them
was
indeed
exactly
because
he
knew
what
was
in
them
and
all
we
are
arguing
in
this
case
is
that
may
be
sufficient.
mr.
michael
clutter
your
honor
as
it
relates
to
constructive
knowledge
i
know
of
none
that
specifically
addressed
the
question.
i
think
that
the
wording
of
hamling
as
it
goes
toward
knowledge
i
think
supports
the
position
of
the
petitioner,
but
most
strongly
i
think
the
smith
v.
california.
the
reasoning
of
smith
is
equally
applicable
to
this
case,
although
it
admittedly
to
lesser
degree
that
chilling
effect
may
not
be
as
strong
if
someone
who
has
no
scienter
requirement
and
thus
cannot
distribute
any
material
unless
he
actually
reads
it.
what
we
have
here
is
not
a
chilling
effect
that
results
in
the
suppression
of
material
which
even
in
the
slightest
way
may
allude
towards
sex
scare
off
the
cautious
bookseller,
the
cautious
film
prevayer
until
he
has
actually
has
personal
knowledge
of
the
film
or
the
book
he
distributes.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
michael
clutter
yes
your
honor.
one
or
two
brief
points
related
to
that
issue
of
the
scienter.
mr.
michael
clutter
no
sir.
i
think
if
the
scienter
standard
was
in
fact
constitutionally
insufficient
--
mr.
michael
clutter
and
if
the
jury
in
fact
was
constitutionally
insufficient
i
think,
it
although
it
might
be
helpful
in
a
retrial
of
this
matter
to
know
whether
the
instructions
should
be
given
again.
it
certainly
is
not
necessary
at
this
point
for
the
court
to
reach
the
question
of
what
jury
instructions
would
be
proper,
should
petitioner
be
retry
before
six-person
jury,
that
would
i
guess
in
a
technical
sense
--
mr.
michael
clutter
that
is
correct
sir.
there
maybe
other
counties
in
the
state.
mr.
michael
clutter
that
would
remove
our
--
if
you
decide
as
a
matter
of
law
that
this
movie
is
obscene.
mr.
michael
clutter
yes
sir.
mr.
michael
clutter
with
all
due
respect
what
the
petitioner
is
interested
in
is
the
opinion
of
a
properly
instructed
jury
and
whether
it
is
obscene.
mr.
michael
clutter
and
before
there
question
even
reaches
ever
reaches
your
honors
on
whether
or
not
the
jury
determination
is
constitutionally
acceptable
and
what
we
contend
in
the
case
that
we
do
not
have
a
properly
instructed
jury
and
no
do
we
have
properly
constituted
jury
to
make
that
determination
in
the
first
instance
before
the
question
ever
gets
to
this
court.
thank
you
sir.
