was
not
your
argument
made
and
rejected
in
mckinney
v.
alabama
by
the
majority,
we
are
dealing
with
the
civil
nuisance
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
in
the
charge,
a
constructive
knowledge
of
obscene
content?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
there
is
any
difference
in
the
standard
to
be
applied
for
constitutional
purposes
to
a
bookstore
proprietor
as
opposed
to
a
movie
house
owner?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
would
think
typically
a
book
store
might
well
have
several
thousand
titles
in
it
at
any
given
time,
whereas
a
movie
theater
presumably
shows
one
or
two
shows
per
night,
does
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
suggesting
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
this
petitioner
was
brought
to
trial
today
then
in
georgia,
how
many
people
would
be
on
his
jury?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
think
we
should
withhold
our
decision
till
that
comes
out
and
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
rhodes,
i
notice
that
georgia
court
of
appeals
at
page
a5
and
a6
of
the
petition
devoted
only
one
paragraph
to
this
claimed
error
in
the
instructions
and
at
the
top
of
page
a6
of
the
petition
it
says
one
charge
complained
of
was
a
quotation
of
the
definition
of
obscene
material
is
set
forth
in
section
26-2101
which
i
think
is
the
one
that
petitioner
refers
to.
is
there
any
place
other
than
in
the
record
itself
whether
there
would
be
available
a
complete
text
of
the
trial
judge's
charge?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
full
charge
is
in
the
joint
appendix?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
