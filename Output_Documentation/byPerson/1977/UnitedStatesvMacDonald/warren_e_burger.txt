we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
united
states
against
mc
donald.
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready
mr.
geller.
chief
justice
warren
e.

mr.
segal.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
does
the
military
establishments
finding,
bear
on
indictment,
leader
brought
by
civil
authorities?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
two
wholly
different
systems
of
justice
are
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
military
code
is
one
and
the
civilian
code
is
quite
another,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
not
any
more
than
a
conclusion
of
an
investigatory
authority,as
mr.
justice
marshall
has
suggested.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
not
trial.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
was
not
exposed
to
jeopardy,
was
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
after
all
this,
indictment
was
had,
case
was
tried
and
the
jury
returned
a
verdict,
is
that
not,
i
am
not
sure
what
these
matters
you
are
discussing
have
to
do
with
it
the
issue
that
you
are
presenting
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
think
it
corrects
it,
if
six
months,
12
months,
18
months
later
the
court
of
appeals
decides
there
was
no
denial
of
a
speedy
trial
and
then
you
are
back
where
you
were
with
the
loss
of
18
months
more.
how
conceivably
could
the
concept
of
speedy
trial
be
advanced
by
allowing
interlocutory
appeals,
if
that
is
the
only
issue.
nothing
in
abney
on
which
you
seem
to
rely
would
give
the
slightest
hints.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
geller?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
this
be
a
part
of
an
ordinary
argument
on
a
speedy
trial
claim
with
the
differing
views
or
exclusive
thought
within
the
criminal
divisions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
they
are
not
of
course,
on
any
record
mr.
geller.
the
fact
that
your
friend
elected
to
you
some
of
his
time
going
in
preps
outside
the
record
is
no
reason--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
united
states
against
macdonald
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
blackmun.
chief
justice
