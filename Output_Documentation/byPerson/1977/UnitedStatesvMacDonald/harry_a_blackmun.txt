justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
this
case
comes
to
us
by
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
the
issue
was
whether
a
defendant
who
was
indicted
on
a
federal
charge
may
appeal
before
trial,
a
federal
district
courts
ordered
denying
his
motion
to
dismiss
an
indictment
because
of
an
alleged
violation
of
his
sixth
amendment
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
the
respondent
captain
macdonald
was
a
physician
in
military
service
stationed
at
fort
bragg
in
north
carolina.
in
1975,
almost
five
years
after
captain
macdonald's
wife
and
two
children
were
murdered,
he
was
indicted
on
three
columns
of
first
degree
murder
in
violation
of
the
federal
statute.
prior
to
trial
the
federal
district
court
denied
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
because
of
the
alleged
denial
of
his
sixth
amendment
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
the
fourth
circuit
allowed
an
interlocutory
appeal
on
the
authority
of
the
cases
it
had
decided
earlier
with
respect
to
an
allegation
of
double
jeopardy.
by
a
divided
vote,
it
reversed
the
district
court's
denial
of
respondent's
motion
to
dismiss
on
speedy
trial
grounds
and
remanded
the
case
with
the
instructions
to
dismiss
the
indictment.
the
government's
petition
for
rehearing,
with
a
suggestion
for
rehearing
en
banc
was
denied
by
an
evenly
divided
vote.
the
panel
majority
recognized
that
the
denial
of
a
pretrial
motion
in
a
criminal
case,
generally
is
not
appealable
and
that
the
point
presented
is
to
be
decided
on
appeal
after
trial,
but
to
an
exception
in
this
case,
however,
because
of
what
it
called
the
extraordinary
nature
of
respondent's
case,
and
then
on
the
merits,
it
decided
the
speedy
trial
claim
in
favor
of
the
respondent
again
by
a
divided
vote.
because
of
the
importance
of
the
jurisdictional
question
to
the
criminal
law,
we
granted
certiorari.
finality
of
judgment
is
been
required
as
a
predicate
for
federal
appellate
jurisdiction
and
to
qualify
for
departure
from
that
general
prohibition
against
piecemeal
appellate
review,
three
factors
must
be
met.
first
the
trial
court's
order
must
constitute
a
complete,
formal
and
final
rejection
of
the
defendant's
claim.
second
it
must
resolve
an
issue
completely
collateral
to
the
cause
of
action
asserted.
and
finally
it
must
involve
and
a
right
that
would
be
lost
perhaps
irreparably
if
review
had
to
await
final
judgment.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
hold
that
a
pretrial
order
rejecting
a
defendant's
speedy
trial
claim,
does
not
represent
a
complete
formal
and
final
rejection
in
the
trial
court
of
the
defendant's
claim.
the
particular
facts
of
the
case,
including
an
estimate
of
the
degree
to
which
delay
has
impaired
an
adequate
defense
can
be
carefully
assessed
only
after
trial
and
further
the
speedy
trial
claim,
unlike
a
double
jeopardy
claim,
is
not
sufficiently
independent
of
the
trial's
outcome
to
warrant
pretrial
appellate
review.
speedy
trial
rights
are
not
lost
if
review
must
await
final
judgment.
by
definition
those
rights
are
already
lost
before
trial.
allowing
an
exception
to
the
rule
against
pretrial
appeals
in
criminal
cases
for
speedy
trial
claims
would
threateningly
feel
precisely
the
values
manifested
in
the
speedy
trial
clause
of
the
sixth
amendment.
accordingly
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
mr.
justice
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
