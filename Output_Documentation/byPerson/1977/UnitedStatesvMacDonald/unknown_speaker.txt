unknown
speaker
there
would
certainly
be
pretrial
review
if
the
shoe
were
on
the
other
foot
or
they
are
not
if
the
defendant
had
moved
the
indictment
be
dismissed
because
to
try
them
now
would
violate
his
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
the
government
could
surely
appeal
that.
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
a
final
order.
unknown
speaker
mr
geller
before
you
turn
to
the
merits,
in
this
case
the
district
court
denied
double
jeopardy
motion
as
well
as
a
speedy
trail
motion
and
your
appeal
presented
both
issues
to
the
court
of
appeals
but
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
decide
the
double
jeopardy
issue.
why
does
not
the
appeal
on
the
double
jeopardy
issue
support
review
of
the
speedy
trail
issue?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
to
dismiss
the
appeal
from
the
speedy
trial?
unknown
speaker
do
these
facts
shed
light
on
why
your
claim
of
denial
of
speedy
trail
was
appealable
to
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
you
shape
your
own
argument
which
is
certainly
upheld
i
hope
you
will
address
that
point
some
time
during
the
30
minutes
that
a
lot
of
--
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
statute
number.
unknown
speaker
has
this
court
ever
sanctioned
review
of
a
denial
of
speedy
trial
claim
by
writ
of
mandamus?
unknown
speaker
you
are
seriously
arguing
that
if
we
hold
that
such
an
order
is
appealable,
that
there
would
not
be
a
lot
of
appeals
?
do
you
think
like
that?
unknown
speaker
just
one
other
question,
if
i
may
mr.
segal,
your
point
if
i
understand
is
that
the
speedy
trial
claim
is
appealable
if
it
has
merit.
unknown
speaker
all
was
appealable.
unknown
speaker
those
three
are
double
jeopardy,
speedy
trial
and
what
is
the
third?
unknown
speaker
bail.
unknown
speaker
why
would
not
you,
why
would
not
--
unknown
speaker
suppose
a
defendant
at
courts
of
appeal,
a
denial
of
his
motion
which
has
two
parts
to
it,
one
there
was
inordinant
pre-indictment
delay
which
he
had
violated
by
by
constitutional
rights.
there
was
a
inordinant
delay
after
indictment
between
indictment
and
trial,
which
violated
right
to
a
speedy
trial,
would
not
you
say
both
of
those
are
appealable
under
your
submission?
unknown
speaker
i
know
but
due
process
motion
is
also
based
on
the
proposition
of
the
trial
should
not
take
place
at
all.
unknown
speaker
well
how
does
that
fair
on
the
appealability
of
the
order
denying
such
a
motion?
unknown
speaker
you
seem
to
think
that
it
is
a
if
you
say
that
you
leisure
the
time
in
this
case
only
after
the
75
indictment
between
then
and
file
there
is
not
any
speedy
trial
claim.
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
just
a
due
process
claim.
unknown
speaker
mr
geller
can
you
just
refresh
my
recollection,
marion,
the
appeal
was
by
the
government?
was
that
not?
it
had
been
that
the
motion
to
dismiss
had
been
granted.
unknown
speaker
so
that
you
were
under
a
different
statute,
no
that
case
is
entirely
different.
unknown
speaker
well
it
was
because
completely
an
abatement
within
the
meaning
of
the
old
criminal
appeals
act.
unknown
speaker
would
you
turn
that
position?
unknown
speaker
mr.
geller,
i
repeat
the
cogitations
within
the
department
of
justice
really
are
not
irrelevant
to
this
issue.
unknown
speaker
mr.
geller
the
factual
matter
that
you
do
try
to
develop
was
presented
in
the
oral
argument
in
the
court
of
appeal--
