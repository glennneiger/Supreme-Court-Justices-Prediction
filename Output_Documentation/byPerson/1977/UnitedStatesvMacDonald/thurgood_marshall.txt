it
was
not
a

was
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
not
a
trial.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
what
bearing
does
it
have
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
not
a
trial
it
was
just
an
investigation.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
just
an
investigation,
was
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
was
he
at
any
time
subject
to
be
sentenced
by
this
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
i
am
talking
about,
is
that
all
what
we
are
talking
about?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
their
conclusion
is
that
we
shall
call
a
general
court
that
is
all
it
says.
it
says
we
will
or
we
would
not
have
general
court,
well
as
a
changed
or
whether
that
is
what
it
does?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
government
also
cited
the
statute
did
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
you
be
interested
in
knowing
about
how
many
petitions
for
certiorari
we
get
based
on
the
speedy
trial
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
would
like
to
cut
it
down.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
this
assumed
that
the
bar
would
not
be
interested
in
trying
out
anything
or
writing
anything?
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
would
assume
that--
i
do
not
know
if
i
am
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
do
not
think
there
is
anything
in
the
law
that
prevents
a
lawyer
from
filing
a
writ
of
mandamus
to
stop
a
judge
from
breathing
--
but
i
assume
that
it
is
done
with
reason.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
i
assume
that
if
you
want
to
have
mandamus
you
can
show
us
a
case
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
your
case
is
which
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
have
a
mandamus
case
on
speedy
trial.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
do
you
have
a
case
on
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
that
they
did?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
made
if
as
an
allegation
that
the
grand
jury
was
not
properly
impounded
and
no
member
to
grand
jury
was
a
live
person,
you
can
not
get
that
to
the
court
of
appeals
no
way
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
right
that
you
can
bring
this
out
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
segal,
do
you
realize
neither
you
nor
i
can
decide
on
the
problems
that
just
go
around,
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
agree
with
that.
