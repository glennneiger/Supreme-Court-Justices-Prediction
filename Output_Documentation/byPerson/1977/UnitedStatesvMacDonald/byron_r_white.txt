this
is
why
i
make
it,
just
so
i
say
that
i
gather
now
that
you
are
saying
that,
an
order
denying,
any
motion
dismissed,
on
speedy
trial
grounds
is
appealable
both
when
the
judge
denies
it
on
the
grounds
--
this
really
is
not
the
speedy
trial
claim
at
all
as
in
this
case
or
it
might
also
if
he
denies
it
on
the
ground
yes
it
is
a
speedy
trial
claim
but
it
is
without
merit,
we
think
both
are
appealable.
