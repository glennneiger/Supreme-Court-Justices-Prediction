mr.
segal,
but
â€“
may
i
interrupt
you
just
a
moment
mr.
segal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
under
your
analysis
if
i
understand
it
every
speedy
trail
claim
would
be
appealable
because
that
argument
could
always
be
made,
but
the
fourth
circuit
did
not
take
that
view,
they
said
usually
you
should
wait
till
after
trial,
but
this
case
is
different.
i
do
not
understand
what
the
court
of
appeals
was
saying
and
maybe
you
can
--
are
you
taking
the
position
that
they
are
always
appealable
or
just
sometimes
and
if
so
when?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
segal
on
mandamus,
question
would
be
one
of
law,
whether
the
judge
had
the
authority
to
deny
the
motion
and
he
always
has
the
authority
to
deny
it,
you
would
not
review
the
question
where
the
merits
on
mandamus.
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
the
same
way
that
the
factual
justification
was
presented
in
the
lovasco
case
was
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no
but
this
is
not
the
first
time
that
the
government
has
justified
delay
by
having
the
advocate
state
to
an
appellate
court
the
reasons
for
the
delay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
exactly
the
same
thing
in
the
lovasco
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
just
suggesting
the
court
has
approved
the
procedure
you
are
following
today.
