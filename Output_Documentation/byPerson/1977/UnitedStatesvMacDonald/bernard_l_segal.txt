mr.
bernard
l.
segal
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
ask
the
court's
indulgence
if
i
may
at
the
outset,
if
you
will
bear
with
me,
if
i
also
pass
over
the
facts
slightly
in
this
case.
as
it
seems
to
me
that
the
solicitor
general's
argument
has
consciously
averted
some
rather
i
think
point
in
significant
findings.
not
my
facts
that
your
honors
pleases
but
the
facts
found
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
facts
found
in
the
most
extraordinary
military
proceeding
that
precipitated
this
case
in
1970.
the
case
does
start
in
february
the
17th,
1970
with
the
murders
of
macdonald
family,
the
wife
and
children.
the
wounds
that
dr.
macdonald
referred
to
by
the
solicitor
of
course
were
testified
to
at
the
military
proceedings
by
the
both
the
government's
doctors
and
the
defense
doctors,
as
being
life
threatening
wounds.
the
reason
for
of
course
was
that
the
one
of
the
government's
multiple
theories
of
trying
to
explain
the
case
was
that
these
were
self
inflicted
by
the
accused
dr.
macdonald
to
cover
up
murder
that
he
had
committed.
in
fact
the
record
failed
to
support
that
and
the
conclusion
of
the
military
presiding
officer
in
1970
was
that
dr.
macdonald
had
told
the
truth,
those
were
his
words.
most
extraordinarily
which
the
government
has
referred
to
a
great
length
are
the
facts
from
this
1970
military
proceedings
is
that
nowhere
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
nowhere
in
the
solicitor
general's
argument,
does
he
share
with
the
court
the
two
and
the
only
two
findings
that
were
made
by
--
mr.
bernard
l.
segal
if
your
honor
pleases,
both
of
these
proceedings
both
the
military
proceeding
1970,
and
the
proceeding
of
federal
district
court
were
proceedings
by
the
same
sovereign,
the
united
states.
there
was
not
a
separate
sovereignty
situation
here.
it
is
a
continuum,
this
is
a
continuous
prosecution
of
dr.
macdonald
by
the
united
states.
as
a
matter
of
fact
if
may
when
i
get
into
my
argument--
mr.
bernard
l.
segal
that
is
right,
if
your
honor
pleases
and--
mr.
bernard
l.
segal
yes
mr.
chief
justice,
i
might
just
point
out,
that
it
is
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
the
election
of
the
government
as
to
which
of
these
two
systems
it
might
go
to.
at
the
very
outset
of
the
case,
the
investigation
was
being
pursued
by
both
the
fbi
and
justice
department
and
the
military
authorities
and
it
was
the
justice
department
that
participated
in
the
ultimate
decision
that
the
prosecution
should
be
brought
initially
in
the
military
system
rather
than
in
the
civilian
court.
if
i
may
though
if
your
honor
pleases,
i
do
want
to
share
with
the
court,
i
do
not
mean
to
prolong
the
discussion
of
the
facts,
but
i
think
they
are
essential
to
an
understanding
of
this
case.
there
are
only
two
findings
at
the
end
of
the
article
32
proceedings,
this
was
the
longest
article
--
article
32
proceeding
in
the
history
of
the
military
justice
system.
mr.
bernard
l.
segal
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
l.
segal
we
do
not--
because
of
the
special
circumstances
concerted
to
be
a
trial,
no
your
honor,
that
is
not
the
issue
for
court
which
is
develops
on
the
double
jeopardy
argument
which
the
court
of
appeals
said
had
merits
but
reserved
any
decision
on
and
therefore
has
not
been
decided
and
not
before
this
court
this
time.
mr.
bernard
l.
segal
the
military
proceeding--
mr.
bernard
l.
segal
no
if
your
honor
pleases,
the-
mr.
bernard
l.
segal
your
honor,
i
would
not
–
i
do
not
think
that
is
correct
characterization
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
bernard
l.
segal
no
your
honor,
not
the
article
32
proceeding.
mr.
bernard
l.
segal
the
article
if
i
may
respond
your
honor
in
this
way,
the
article
32
proceedings
encompasses
more
than
just
a
phase
that
i
am
now
referring
to.
the
proceeding
encompasses
then
and
adjudication
and
the
conclusion
of
it
by
the
convening
authority,
again
we
are
talking
about
issues
that
relate
to
double
jeopardy
case
there.
mr.
bernard
l.
segal
the
language
of
the
formal
order
at
the
conclusion
of
the
military
proceeding
was
to
dismiss
the
charges,
but
that
was
a
formal
piece
of
language
that
we
did
not
take
cognizance
of
what
the
uniform
code
a
military
justice
required
to
be
found
by
colonel
rock,
at
the
end
if
your
honor
pleases.
at
the
of
a
proceeding
of
span
something
nearly
six
months
with
a
2000
page
record
with
90
pages
of
findings
and
summary
of
the
evidence.
colonel
rock
made
two
findings.
first
of
all,
that
the
charges
were
not
true,
those
are
the
words
of
the
findings.
this
is
not
like
a
civilian
court
and
which
probable
cause
or
the
lack
thereof
is
the
issue.
it
is
a
different
unique
standard
in
military
system
and
his
findings
were
that
the
charge
against
dr.
macdonald
were
not
true.
the
second
finding
was
contrary
as
to
what
the
solicitor
suggests
that
there
be
further
investigation
by
the
civilian
authorities,
the
findings
was
that
a
named
woman
uncovered
by
the
defense
as
being
specifically
involved
and
present
at
the
murder
scene,
should
be
the
person
investigated
by
the
civilian
authorities,
not
dr.
macdonald,
as
i
think
is
the
seeming
implication
of
way
the
solicitor
presented
this
morning.
going
to--
mr.
bernard
l.
segal
the
finding--
mr.
bernard
l.
segal
no
your
honor,
it
is
not
a
trial.
mr.
bernard
l.
segal
not
by
virtue
of
being
before
colonel
rock,
no
jeopardy
attached
your
honor
--
it
is
the
argument
that
we
think
has
not
been
decided
by
the
fourth
circuit
clearly
is
not
the
result.
jeopardy
attached
when
colonel
--
when
major
general
flanagan
entered
his
final
order
he
was
the
authority
he
was
the
equivalent
of
the
district
judge
entering
a
final
order.
but
again
that
is
beyond
the
scope
of
the
case
before
this
court.
let
me
pass
your
if
your
honor
pleases,
just
to
the
other
parts
of
the
facts
that
i
wanted
to
make
reference
to,
and
that
is--
mr.
bernard
l.
segal
no
your
honor,
please
i
can
proceed
if
you
will
--
mr.
bernard
l.
segal
i
thoroughly
intend
to
your
honor
and
i
appreciate
the
suggestion
but
i
do
think
that
it
is
necessary
to
understand
the
case
because
even
the
government
itself
has
said
in
prior
memorandum
filed
with
this
court
that
this
is
a
unique
case
and
extraordinary
case
on
its
facts
and
i
think
that
the
facts
require
some
touching.
if
i
may
then
proceed
for
the
question
though
of
the
appealability
of
the
denial
of
the
dr.
macdonald
motion
for
speedy
trial
prior
to
trial.
it
seems
to
me
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
accepting
this
case
was
neither
extraordinary
or
out
of
line
with
the
prior
decision
that
rendered
itself
in
lansdowne
and
with
in
facts
the
concept
that
were
approved
by
this
court
originally
in
cohen
v.
beneficial
loan
company
in
1949
reaffirmed
by
this
court
in
abney.
conceptually
they
are
the
same.
if
your
honor
pleases,
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals,
judge
burstner
(ph)
writing
for
the
majority
made
the
point
very
clear
when
it
said
this
is
one
of
the
small
classes
--
small
class
of
rights
that
must
be
reviewed
in
criminal
cases
pretrial.
the
claim
in
this
case
is
clearly
collateral,
the
order
in
this
case
and
i
am
not
necessary
saying
that
every
order
and
every
speedy
trial
case
but
clearly
the
order
in
this
case
was
a
final
order.
there
was
a
need
and
the
court
of
appeals
so
found
for
immediate
appellate
review
of
this
case
because
the
right
would
probably
be
lost
forever
and
clearly
the
court
of
appeals
found
as
in
cohen
that
was
set
fourth,
one
of
the
criteria,
the
right
was
too
important
to
be
denied
an
immediate
review.
now
on
the
issue
of
of
collateralness
of
the
speedy
trial
issue
which
i
think
is
a
special
question.
i
do
not
ask
the
court
to
accept
my
words,
i
ask
the
court
to
accept
the
words
of
the
government
because
in
united
states
v.
marion
it
was
precisely
the
words
of
the
government
to
this
court
in
arguing
why
the
government
should
be
allowed
to
appeal
the
granting
of
a
motion
by
the
defendant
dismissed
an
indictment
for
denial
for
speed
trial,
where
the
defendant
on
the
appeal
to
this
court
challenged
the
ability
of
the
government
to
seek
review--
mr.
bernard
l.
segal
yes
your
honor
the
government
cited
the
statute
but
the
argument--
mr.
bernard
l.
segal
your
honor
please
we
--
mr.
bernard
l.
segal
1291
we
think
is
the
correct
statute
in
this
case
that
this
is
a
final
order
appealable
under
that
statute.
court
of
appeal
so
found
and
i
think
the
court
of
appeal's
reasoning
is
clearly
consonant
with
the
reasoning
of
this
court
in
abney.
now
if
i
might
just
simply
refer
thought
your
honor,
but
i
think
it
is
important
to
understand
whether
or
not
this
issue
is
collateral,
to
simply
what
the
government
said
in
describing
collateralness
in
the
marion
case.
in
marion,
the
government
used
exactly
if
i
may
from
the
government's
brief
in
marion
used
precisely
these
words.
it
said,
“the
defendant
does
not
deny
that
he
had
committed
the
acts
charged
or
that
those
acts
constitute
a
crime”
but
nevertheless
he
urges
that
he
can
not
be
prosecuted
because
of
some
and
the
word
used
here
was
extraneous
factor,
such
as
the
toling
in
the
statute
limitations
or
the
denial
of
a
speedy
trail.
in
its
reply
brief
the
government
returns
to
the
description
of
speedy
trial
claim
and
says
such
a
plea
sets
up
by
way
of
defense
acclaimed
at
bar's
conviction
whether
or
not
the
defendant
is
guilty
and
this
court
mr.
white
writing
for
the
court
in
marion
echoes
exactly
the
same
language.
it
says
it
is
independent
of
the
issues
of
guilt
or
innocent.
the
question
of
a
speedy
trial
is
not
in
any
way
connected
with
the
trial
evidence,
it
is
connected
simply
with
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
government
has
improperly
delayed
for
an
excessive
period
of
time
--
mr.
bernard
l.
segal
yes
justice
stevens.
mr.
bernard
l.
segal
in
view
of
the
decision
of
this
court
mr
justice
stevens
in
abney,
i
think
that
the
speedy
trial
claims
are
appealable
as
a
matter
of
right
as
being
part
of
the
small
class
of
criminal
cases
referred
to
in
cohen
and
referred
to
again
in
abney.
i
will
suggest
the
court
that
the
bubble
boo
raised
that
somehow
were
going
to
open
the
flood
gates
to
a
lot
of
frivolous
speedy
trial
claims
is
again
unsupported
by
the
facts
of
the
rationality.
let
me
point
out
several
things.
first
of
all
there
have
been
29
years
that
relapses
the
cohen
doctrine
was
first
articulated
which
means
that
for
29
years
defendants
and
defense
lawyers
in
criminal
cases
apparently
are
to
presumed
to
be
aware
that
they
could
have
sought
interlocutory
appeals
from
the
denial
of
speedy
trial
claims
by
district
courts.
as
the
government
points
out
in
its
brief
there
are
only
two
reported
cases
that
we
can
find
in
the
29
years
of
the
cohen
case.
it
does
not
indicate
some
great
landmark
abuse
by
district
courts,
by
lawyers
or
by
courts
of
appeal
reviewing
these
matters.
mr.
bernard
l.
segal
i
would
think
your
honor
that,
that
will
not
be
changed
in
any
way
by
the
ruling
this
case.
mr.
bernard
l.
segal
may
i
point
out
your
honor
that
in
fact
there
is
no
floodgate
to
be
opened
by
this
case
because
the
floodgate
is
open
already.
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
any
defendant
who
has
denied
his
or
her
motion
for
speedy
trial
by
district
court
under
the
procedures
presently
intact
and
which
will
not
be
affected
by
any
decision
in
this
case
can
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
with
a
writ
of
mandamus.
the
only
difference
between
that
and
what
we
are
talking
about
now
is
the
notice
to
the
appeal
is
shorter
form.
there
is
less
to
be
said.
it
does
not
take
much
for
the
defendant
or
the
defendant's
lawyer
to
propose
a
writ
of
mandamus.
mr.
bernard
l.
segal
the
assumption
of
your
honor--
mr.
bernard
l.
segal
i
will
also
assume
something
else
mr
justice
marshall
which
is
namely
that
i
do
not
think
that
if
this
court
carefully
articulates
the
type
of
speedy
trial
claims
that
are
worthy
of
pretrial
consideration,
that
if
they
meet
the
cohen
standard
that
i
think
the
bar
would
also
be
preceptive
enough
to
see
that.
but
i
am
assuming
as
to
the
government's
dark
view
of
this
case
if
i
may.
the
dark
view
is
something
along
the
lines
--
mr.
bernard
l.
segal
there
is
no
case
that
i
am
aware
of
your
honor
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
law
of
mandamus
that
prohibits
the
defendant.
it
is
clear
that
the
defendant
can
not
file
a
writ
of
mandamus
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
--
mr.
bernard
l.
segal
yes
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
l.
segal
what
i
am
suggesting
your
honor
is
that
mandamus
in
fact
does
lie
and
that
the
fact
that
lawyers
are
exercising
expression.
mr.
bernard
l.
segal
that
i
do
not
have
it
in
my
brief
i
will
be
glad
to
see
it.
mr.
bernard
l.
segal
i
think
the
law
mending
clearly
it
is
there.
mr.
bernard
l.
segal
not
on
my
finger
tips
and
if
i
may
with
your
honor's
permission
i
would
appreciate
an
opportunity
to
submit
the
authorities
after
the
argument.
but
i
do
suggest
the
court
that
mandamus
lies,
even
the
most
frivolous.
even
assuming
your
honor's
position
that
mandamus
does
not
lie,
what
does
this
stop
the
lawyer
from
doing
it
and-
mr.
bernard
l.
segal
perhaps
i
have
inadequately
stated
in
my
position
mr
justice
stevens.
all
i
am
suggesting
of
course
is
not
this
mandamus
may
or
may
not
be
the
proper
form.
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
if
lawyers
want
to
badge
our
appellate
courts.
they
already
have
the
format
to
do
with
it.
let
us
assume
that
mandamus
does
not
lie,
does
not
mean
that
lawyers
may
not
erroneously
perceive
that
way
and
being
denied
by
courts
of
appeal
may
not
erroneously
petition
this
court
for
certiorari.
what
i
am
simply
trying
to
respond
to
is
not
to
argue
the
merits
or
lack
that
merits
of
mandamus
as
a
form
of
relieving
this
problem
but
what
i
want
to
point
out
to,
i
think
is
essentially
the
specious
nature
of
suggestion
that
if
this
court
were
to
conclude
that
the
rationality
--
mr.
bernard
l.
segal
i
think
in
the
seminal
period
until
the
courts
of
appeals
handle
the
cases
i
will
suggest
to
you.
i
do
not
think
that
every
speedy
trial
argument,
every
speedy
trial
claim
merits
a
full
argument.
the
court
is
perfectly
capable
or
courts
of
appeals
are
perfectly
capable
of
reading
the
papers
and
without
argument
determining
which
are
without
merit.
i
have
practiced
if
your
honor
pleases
in
federal
criminal
courts
of
something
like
18
years.
i
did
not
need
the
cohen
case
to
tell
me
it
was
unwise
to
take
interlocutory
appeals
in
criminal
cases.
we
knew
that
the
courts
of
appeals
we
all
experienced
the
courts
of
appeals
the
filing
of
a
paper,
the
filing
of
a
governments
one-and-half
page
motion
to
dismiss
or
on
the
law
of
the
merits
and
an
answer
from
the
court
of
throwing
out
an
unmerited
appeal.
all
i
am
saying
is
i
would
hope
this
court
would
not
be
led
it
straight.
mr.
bernard
l.
segal
no
your
honor
my
point
is
that
speedy
trial
claim
within
the
meaning
of
cohen
as
we
articulated,
abney
is
that
the
speedy
trial
is
one
of
what
i
would
say
only
three
claims
that
are
appealable
and
interlocutory
phase
in
criminal
cases.
mr.
bernard
l.
segal
yes
your
honor.
three
aspects
--
mr.
bernard
l.
segal
bail.
mr.
bernard
l.
segal
stack
versus
boyle
--
mr.
bernard
l.
segal
no
your
honor
that
is
clear
as
not,
it
is
not
an
issue
--
mr.
bernard
l.
segal
i
do
not
think
as
it
stands
now
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
l.
segal
no
if
your
honor
please
that
was
not
my
submission
i
would
offer
a
lesser
submission.
what
i
am
talking
about
here
is
the
sixth
amendment
issue,
the
pre-indictment
delay
--
mr.
bernard
l.
segal
the
difficulty
is
though
your
honor
is
the
finality
issue.
if
we
are
using
the
cohen
standard.
cohen
requires
there
would
be
a
finality.
in
this
particular
case
their
was
finality
because
the
district
judge
entered
a
very
specific
order
and
wrote
an
opinion
and
his
opinion
was
that
in
this
case,
the
running
--
in
order
to
be
speech
trial
right
on
the
sixth
amendment,
there
had
to
be
a
public
acquisition
on
that
score,
the
judge
was
right
and
was
upheld,
and
that
language
was
correctly
found
by
the
court
of
appeals.
but
he
erred
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
the
err
when
he
said
that
the
public
acquisition
in
this
case
had
not
taken
place
until
january
1975
when
the
indictment
was
returned.
as
judges
burstner
(ph)
and
russel
found
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
public
acquisition
had
taken
place
in
april
of
1970,
in
may
of
1970,
when
the
government
called
a
press
conference
and
announce
the
formal
charges.
in
this
case
there
was
nothing
further
that
a
trial
can
add.
there
was
nothing
that
can
be
shown
by
a
trial.
nothing
will
happen
before
judge
dupree
the
district
judge,
in
any
way
can
alter
the
speedy
trial
claim.
because
he
has
held
as
a
matter
of
law.
that
the
speedy
trial
claim
in
this
case
ran
only
from
january
25,
1975.
we
have
no
argument,
no
quarrel
with
that
date
and
proceeding
to
the
district
court.
our
quarrel
is
the
five
years
delay
found
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
be
absolutely
unjustified,
absolutely
without
rational
explanation
except
if
your
honor
pleases
for
the
one
offer
by
the
government
below.
the
court
of
appeals
found
and
quoted
at
length,
the
statement
by
governments
counsel
in
january
1975
at
preliminary
proceeding
of
this
case.
when
asked
by
the
united
state
magistrate,
what
is
it
that
took
five
years
to
restart
this
case
again,
it
having
started.
back
in
april
of
1970?
in
a
moment
of
cantor,
all
too
often
not
her.
governments
counsel
said
it
was
bureaucracy.
what
happened
was
he
said
to
the
majesty
and
that
was
repeated
again
later
on,
what
happened
your
honor
was,
we
needed
the
fbi
laboratory
to
do
some
of
the
laboratory
technical
work
and
bureaucracy
prevented
us
from
1970
to
1975
from
getting
the
fbi
laboratory.
that
is
the
reason.
now
i
might
say
in
its
brief
to
this
court
the
government
has
shifted
now
to
what
is
now
its
third
position
on
what
caused
the
delay
in
this
case.
i
must
say
something.
i
am
profoundly
surprised
that
counsel
for
the
government
would
get
up
to
this
court
and
say
and
see
the
macdonald
itself
is
an
absolute
example
of
the
delay
that
defendants
could
bring.
i
have
set
forth
at
page
40
the
proceedings
in
which
the
government
has
dragged
its
foot,
been
late,
extended
time
and
doubled
the
extended
time
asked
for
unprecedented
extensions
of
time
to
file
motions
and
briefs
that
are
not
allowed
in
the
court
of
appeals,
has
asked
for
double
time
to
file
petitions
for
extension
to
this
court.
it
is
set
out
in
footnote
at
the
page
40
y
in
the
name
of
habin
(ph).
in
this,
of
all
the
cases
where
the
government
has
really
nothing
to
say
for
its
delay,
except
the
words
or
the
government's
attorney
who
said
bureaucracy,
they
would
suggest
the
macdonald
case,
is
the
one
which
in
an
example
to
the
contrary.
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
there
were
two-and-half
years
in
this
case
which
absolutely
nothing
of
significance
took
place
in
the
justice
department.
the
chronology
of
this
case
was
that
the
charges
were
finally
dismissed
in
the
october
of
1970.
now,
we
contend,
it
is
position
if
your
honor
please
that
those
dismissal
by
general
flanagan
constitutes
double
jeopardy
but
since
as
not
the
issue
here
arguendo
will
take
the
governments
position
that
it
was
not
final.
the
government
in
fact
proceeded
reasonably
promptly
after
that
dismissal
to
restart
the
investigation.
in
january
of
'71
just
less
than
two-and-half
months
later,
a
new
team
of
military
investigators
were
assigned.
as
a
matter
of
fact
ten
investigators
were
assigned
full
time
for
one
year.
they
worked
in
to
december
of
'71.
we
find
no
fault
with
that
proceeding
in
the
course
of
those
eleven-and-half
months,
they
reinterviewed
every
witness
in
this
case.
they
have
reinterviewed
699
witnesses,
they
did
a
reinvestigation
job.
we
do
not
find
any
fault
with
that.
either
to
the
court
of
appeals
but
from
december
of
1971
and
until
the
return
of
the
indictment,
there
is
no
significant
activity
by
the
government
nothing
that
justifies
it.
the
investigators
took
about
six
months
to
write
a
report.
that
even
that
was
in
the
hands
of
the
justice
department
in
the
june
of
1972.
again
the
court
of
appeal
thought
it
was
interesting
to
read
the
government's
own
words,
not
only
bureaucracy
explanation.
but
the
court
of
appeals
made
reference
to
the
affidavit
given
by
the
government
of
kevin
moroney,
an
assistant
attorney
general
in
the
criminal
division.
moroney
was
purporting
to
explain
why
once
this
massive
data,
two
complete
sets
of
investigations,
thorough
work
by
every
member
of
the
military
involved,
why
the
justice
department
then
did
nothing
from
june
of
1972
until
the
grand
jury
was
convened
in
august
of
74.
and
in
the
affidavit
of
mr.
moroney,
the
court
of
appeal
cited,
we
have
this
report
and
we
assigned
it
to
lawyers
and
we
reassigned
it.
those
are
were
mr.
moroney's
words
we
assigned
it
and
reassigned
it,
we
reviewed
and
re-reviewed
it,
and
nobody
made
a
decision.
no
one
did
anything.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
solicitor
general
concedes
in
his
argument
and
he
knows
the
facts,
and
we
know
the
fact,
only
two
pieces
of
investigative
work
took
place
after
december
1971.
they
were
explained
in
the
brief
they
are
trivial,
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
merits
of
the
case.
nothing
has
happened.
what
really
was
the
explanation
was
that
no
one
wanted
to
make
a
decision,
that
is
clear
from
the
findings.
we
can
tell
you
we
know
that
is
the
reason,
it
was
possible
by
three
independent
pieces
of
evidence.
one
colonel
rock
had
to
make
a
finding
in
this
case
your
honors.
he
had
sat
through
six
month
of
proceedings,
he
wrote
2000
page
record
in
five
weeks.
he
prepared
a
90
page
summary
of
findings
and
conclusions
and
details
which
have
never
been
challenged,
which
the
government
accepted.
he
made
his
decision
in
five
weeks.
later
on,
a
new
u.s.
attorney
took
over
this
case
in
eastern
district
of
north
carolina.
now
he
took
over
whole
of
office,
he
was
not
even
in
the
office
prior
to
his
taking
that
position.
in
the
matter
of
four
months,
he
not
only
took
control
on
office,
he
finished
a
56
page
report
to
the
justice
department
and
said,
“i
want
to
go
ahead
and
prosecute
macdonald,
send
me
trial
lawyer”.
what
in
march
of
1972
did
the
justice
department
do?
it
sent
it
to
another
lawyer
to
review
the
report,
he
had
just
finished
56
page
evaluation.
the
justice
department,
he
said,
“send
me
lawyer,
we
will
do
something”
and
justice
department
did
nothing
but
reviewed
again
and
all
the
affidavits,
there
is
no
action
by
anyone.
finally,
last
example,
in
may
of
1974
the
case
finally
wound
up
on
the
hands,
now
some
four
years
after
the
crime,
nearly
two
years
after
the
cid
had
finished
its
reinvestigation
in
the
hands
of
victor
wahrheit(ph)
another
staff
attorney.
in
one
month,
he
was
able
to
read
the
entire
file,
all
the
envelops,
all
the
drawers
of
it.
interview
with
judge
the
north
of
carolina,
interviewed
cid
investigators,
talk
with
other
attorneys
in
case
and
conclude
that
he
wanted
to
convene
a
grand
jury
investigation.
he
did
that
all
the
month
and
a
month
later
a
grand
jury
was
in
panel.
the
case
was
susceptible
of
resolution.
the
court
of
appeals
found
there
was
no
adequate
explanation
for
two-and-half
--
mr.
bernard
l.
segal
if
your
honor
please
if
you
suggest
the
--
mr.
bernard
l.
segal
i
suppose,
that
we
do
not
have
any
direct
influence,
but
i
think
the
words
of
this
court
have
influence.
what
we
are
--
mr.
bernard
l.
segal
well
there
are
two
issue
your
honor.
i
must
say
that
the
argument
has
gone
to
the
merits
of
the
speedy
trial
arguments,
i
did
not
want
leave
the
podium
without
an
opportunity
to
express
some
of
of
the
facts
of
the
matter,
i
just
returned
them
to
the
appealability
issue
has
said,
your
honor's
own
words
in
the
strunk
case
i
think
are
very
instructive.
this
case
must
be,
all
speedy
trial
claim
cases
must
have
a
right
to
the
appeal.
not
all
deserve
a
full
hearing
and
argument
but
in
strunk
a
court
of
appeal
attempted
some
solution
short
of
dismissing
the
indictment,
which
this
court
has
held
to
be
the
only
relief.
they
attempted
to
shorten
the
defendant's
sentence
by
292
days
to
accommodate
what
they
found
to
be
as
there
was
an
unreasonable
ten
month
delay.
your
honor
set
fourth,
that
you
can
not
correct
a
speedy
trial
defect
by
somehow
playing
games
with
the
numbers.
the
only
correction
for
the
defect
of
the
speedy
trial,
that
is
the
denial
of
a
trial
that
is
less
than
speedy,
once
it
has
been
denied
cannot
be
re-given
to
the
defendant.
mr.
bernard
l.
segal
your
honor
please,
that
the
cohen
doctrine,
reiterated
in
abney
says
that
is
this
the
kind
of
matter
which
requires
will
of
right
be
lost.
if
it
is
not
in
fact,
allow
a
pre-trial
and
my
suggestion
to
court
is
as
follows.
number
one;
the
speedy
trial
right
means
as
it
means
anything,
the
right
to
not
be
given
a
trial
other
than
the
one
that
is
speedy,
that
is
once
the
government
is
delayed
inordinately
and
without
justification,
there
is
nothing
more
the
government
can
do
to
correct
the
defect.
you
cannot
do
anything
to
change
the
situation.
if
that
is
correct,
if
your
honor
pleases
then
the
defendant's
right,
right
of
the
accused
is
not
to
be
tried
by
a
court
which
in
effect
has
no
capacity
to
correct
in
any
way
the
wrong
that
was
done
to
him.
mr.
bernard
l.
segal
i
think
the
criteria
if
your
honor
pleases
in
abney
are
perfectly
in
synchronization
with
these
facts
and
the
circumstances
of
speedy
trial.
may
i
just
say
this
and
my
time
i
see
is
running
out,
but
i
think
is
running
out
but
i
think
is
important
i
share
with
the
court
the
following.
if
you
were
to
accept
the
government's
concept
that
speedy
trial
--
and
i
am
talking
only
now
about
sixth
amendment
speedy
trial
not
talking
about
fifth
amendment
due
process
issue
because
in
this
case
the
judge's
decision
is
complete,
there
is
nothing
that
can
be
changed
in
regard
to
the
speedy
trial
decision
by
the
trial.
mr.
bernard
l.
segal
i
must
confess
mr.
justice
white
i
did
not
perceive
judge
dupree's
order
as
saying
it
was
not
a
speedy
trail
claim
i
think
he
--
mr.
bernard
l.
segal
that
is
correct
you
honor.
mr.
bernard
l.
segal
we
have
not
even
contented
that
at
this
stage.
it
is
not
even
before
this
court.
our
contention
it
is
the
government
brief
that
is
forced
it
i
think
upon
the
court,
the
suggestion
that
somehow
we
had
to
prove
prejudice.
may
i
just
finish
with
one
sentence
your
honor
that
is
to
accept
the
government's
contention,
that
the
speedy
trial
claim
must
wait
after
trial
is
to
say
that
only
the
guilty
will
have
the
benefit
of
the
speedy
trial
claim
because
only
a
person
who
has
been
convicted
may
then
have
the
right
to
speedy
trial
vindicated
by
the
reversal
of
that
conviction.
we
say
in
a
case
such
as
this
one
where
in
fact
there
has
been
extraordinary
proceeding,
which
the
finding
was
the
charge
were
not
true,
we
say
in
a
case
such
as
this
one
that
a
person
who
goes
to
trial
and
is
even
acquitted,
it
is
not
a
vindication
of
the
sixth
amendment
speedy
trial
right
to
say
there
is
nothing
more
you
could
do.
i
think
an
argument
by
the
government
is
somewhat
disingenuous
which
says
the
only
vindication
for
the
right
is
you
have
to
be
convicted
and
then
a
appellate
court
will
tell
you
that
you
should
never
have
been
trialled
in
first
place.
