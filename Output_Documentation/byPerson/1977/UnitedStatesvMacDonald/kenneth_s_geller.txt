mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
granted
certiorari
in
this
case
to
resolve
two
important
issues
of
federal
criminal
law.
the
first
is
whether
a
defendant
may
appeal
prior
to
trial
from
the
denial
of
his
motions
to
dismiss
and
indictment
on
speedy
trial
grounds.
the
second
issue
which
need
only
be
reached
if
the
court
holds
that
such
interlocutory
appeals
are
permissible,
is
whether
the
period
after
criminal
charges
against
the
defendant
have
been
dismissed.
but
before
the
same
or
related
charges
are
re-instituted
against
them
should
be
considered
in
determining
whether
the
defendant
has
been
prior
to
his
right
to
speedy
trial.
their
facts
are
as
follows.
in
the
early
morning
of
february
17
1970,
respondent's
wife
and
two
small
daughters
were
clubbed
and
stabbed
to
death
in
respondent's
apartment
on
the
fort
bragg
military
reservation
in
north
carolina
where
respondent
was
assigned
as
a
medical
doctor.
respondent
who
also
suffered
some
woulds
notified
the
military
police
of
the
attacks,
claiming
that
he
and
his
family
had
been
assaulted
by
force
so
called
hippies
who
were
apparently
been
under
the
influence
of
drugs.
respondent
at
first
was
viewed
as
a
victim
rather
that
as
a
suspect.
however
after
an
intensive
but
incomplete
investigation
of
the
crimes,
had
been
conducted
by
the
cid
the
army's
criminal
investigative
unit.
it
became
apparent
that
many
aspects
of
respondent's
version
of
the
attacks
and
of
the
subsequent
actions
upon
discovering
his
family's
bodies
could
not
be
squared
with
the
preliminary
laboratory
analysis
of
the
physical
evidence
of
the
crime.
in
april
1970
therefore
respondent
was
warned
that
he
was
a
suspect
in
the
murders
was
advised
of
his
rights
by
military
authorities
and
was
confined
to
the
military
reservation
by
his
immediate
commanding
officer.
three
weeks
later,
respondent
was
formally
charged
by
his
commander
with
three
specifications
of
murder.
as
required
by
article
32
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice,
an
officer
colonel
warren
rock
was
appointed
to
investigate
the
matter
and
to
recommend
whether
the
charges
should
be
referred
by
the
post
commander
to
a
general
court
marshal
for
trial.
after
considering
the
other
evidence
on
the
case
over
the
next
several
months
colonel
rock
recommended
that
the
charges
against
the
respondent
be
dismissed
but
that
further
investigation
of
the
murders
be
undertaken
by
the
appropriate
civilian
authorities.
this
recommendation
was
accepted
by
the
commanding
general
of
respondent's
unit
who
dismissed
all
charges
against
respondent
in
october
1970.
two
months
later,
in
december
1970
respondent
was
granted
an
honorable
discharge
by
the
army.
following
respondent's
release
from
the
military
the
department
of
justice
requested
the
cid
to
continue
its
investigation
in
the
case.
the
cid
did
so
and
in
june
1972
it
submitted
a
massive
13
volume
report
to
the
department,
which
was
supplemented
by
further
reports
in
november
1972
and
august
1973.
respondent
was
eventually
indicted
on
three
counts
of
murder
in
january
1975
by
grand
jury
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
north
carolina.
respondent
moved
to
dismiss
the
indictment
on
a
number
of
grounds
including
double
jeopardy
and
denial
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
the
district
court
denied
each
of
these
motions
in
july
1975
and
schedule
respondent's
trial
to
begin
in
august
1975.
respondent
instead
took
an
immediate
appeal
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
that
court
held
that
it
had
jurisdiction
over
respondent's
double
jeopardy
claim
under
its
decisions
in
united
states
against
lansdowne.
the
decisions
subsequently
approved
by
this
court
in
abney
against
the
united
states
and
that
respondents
speedy
trial
claim
was
also
a
proper
subject
for
a
pre-trail
appellate
review
because
it
involved
the
fundamental
constitutional
right
because
of
his”pendent
to
the
double
jeopardy
claim
and
closely
related
to
it”
and
because
the
court
believed
that
its
ruling
on
the
issue
would
expedite
the
ultimate
resolution
of
what
it
viewed
as
an
extraordinary
case.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
my
recollection
mr.
justice
rehnquist
is
that
it
cited
none.
that
aspect
of
the
court
of
appeals
decisions
is
at
page
5a,
the
appendix
of
the
petition.
the
court
then
concluded
on
the
merits
that
respondent
had
been
denied
the
speedy
trial
on
the
merits
because
of
the
delay
of
more
than
four-and-half
years
between
his
arrest
by
the
army
in
may
1970,
and
his
federal
indictment
in
january
1975.
it
viewed
as
of
no
significance
for
sixth
amendment
purposes
that
respondent
had
not
been
under
any
criminal
charges
for
more
than
four
years
at
that
period.
now,
the
threshold
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
had
jurisdiction
to
review
respondent's
pre-trail
appeal
for
the
denial
of
the
speedy
trial
motion.
we
submit
that
it
did
not.
under
the
controlling
jurisdictional
statute
28
usc
1291
the
courts
of
appeal
may
review
only
final
decisions
of
the
district
court's.
a
phrase
that
this
court
has
consistently
construed
to
bar
piecemeal
appeals
before
final
judgment.
adherence
to
this
rule
of
finality
has
particularly
stringent
in
criminal
cases
because
the
delays
and
disruptions
caused
by
interlocutory
appeals
are
especially
inimical
to
the
effective
administration
of
the
criminal
law.
respondent
of
course,
does
not
claimed
that
the
pre-trail
denial
of
his
motions
to
dismiss
the
indictment
on
speedy
trial
grounds
was
a
final
decisions,
in
the
sense
that
it
terminated
the
proceedings
against
him
in
the
district
court.
obviously
the
court's
ruling
only
allowed
the
case
to
proceed
the
trial
where
a
number
of
other
factors
may
have
led
to
to
dismissal
on
acquittal.
rather
respondent
contends
that
the
denial
of
the
speedy
trial
motion
is
immediately
appealable
before
trial.
under
the
so
called
collateral
order
exception
to
the
final
judgment.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
it
can
and
it
is
our
position
that
that
would
be
the
preferable
way
in
which
to
present
it
because
as
i
will
get
to
in
a
moment,
it
is
often
impossible
to
rule
on
such
a
motion
until
you
see
what
the
evidence
is
a
trial
because
frequently
the
defendant's
contentions
would
be
that
he
has
been
prejudiced
in
his
ability
to
defend
himself
by
the
delay
that
might
have
been
caused
by
the
the
government
and
it
is
only
after
trial
that
such
a
claim
can
be
intelligently
assessed.
and
this
court
most
recently
applied
the
collateral
order
doctrine,
last
term
in
abney
against
the
united
states
in
holding
that
the
courts
of
appeals
had
jurisdiction
under
section
1291
to
entertain
interlocutory
appeal
from
the
denial
to
dismiss
an
indictment
because
of
double
jeopardy.
in
reaching
that
conclusion
the
court
stressed
that
the
trial
judge's
pre-trial
denial
of
the
double
jeopardy
motion
constituted
a
complete
formal
and
final
rejection
of
the
fifth
amendment
claim
in
the
district
court.
but
the
claim
by
its
very
nature
was
wholly
collateral
to
and
separable
from
the
issues
to
be
litigated
at
the
trial
and
that
the
most
important
is
the
protection
is
been
preferred
on
an
accused
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause
would
be
significantly
undermined
if
appellate
review
had
to
wait
until
after
conviction
because
the
double
jeopardy
clause
protects
an
individual
not
only
against
being
punished
twice
for
the
same
offense
but
also
against
being
tried
twice
for
that
offense.
that
aspect
of
the
constitutional
right
could
not
be
indicated
by
reversal
of
any
conviction
obtained
at
the
second
trial
and
would
be
irreparably
lost
unless
an
immediate
pre-trail
appeal
were
permitted.
we
have
explained
at
some
length
in
our
brief
why
the
denial
prior
to
trial
of
a
speedy
trial
motion
unlike
the
denial
of
the
double
jeopardy
motion
is
not
normally
a
final
rejection
of
the
claim
in
the
district
court,
because
as
i
just
explained
in
response
to
the
question
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
an
intelligent
application
of
the
bar
for
viewing
those
standards
often
may
not
be
possible
before
trial.
for
many
of
the
same
reasons
speedy
trial
claim
again
unlike
double
jeopardy
claims
are
not
wholly
collateral
to
the
matters
to
the
raise
the
trial
because
only
after
the
trial
can
it
be
determined
whether
the
defendant
has
truly
been
prejudiced
by
pre
trial
delay.
respondents
has
not
seriously
disputed
these
contentions
in
his
brief.
instead
he
asserts
that
sixth
amendment
speedy
trial
clause
just
like
fifth
amendment
double
jeopardy
clause
creates
a
so
called
right
not
to
be
tried,
a
right
which
to
be
effective
requires
recognition
of
the
concomitant
right
to
immediate
appellate
review,
but
there
is
a
little
to
support
this
assertion.
as
the
language
of
the
sixth
amendment
suggests
that
is
the
delay
before
trial
and
not
the
trial
itself
that
violates
the
constitutional
guarantee.
the
concern
of
the
sixth
amendment
is
not
the
trial
but
the
any
delays
surrounding
it.
if
the
pertinent
factors
identified
in
barker
v.
wingo
in
a
particular
case
to
deprive
the
defendant
of
his
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
that
violation
by
definition
must
have
occurred
prior
to
the
beginning
of
the
trial.
hence
unlike
the
situation
in
abney
proceeding
with
the
trial
itself
would
not
cause
or
compound
the
constitutional
deprivation.
by
the
same
token
and
again
by
contrast
to
the
fifth
amendment
protection
against
double
jeopardy,
the
effectiveness
of
appellate
review
of
speedy
trial
claims
is
not
diminished
in
any
way
by
awaiting
the
outcome
of
the
trial.
this
court
is
identified
three
interests
of
a
defendant
that
the
speedy
trial
clause
is
designed
to
protect.
first,
to
prevent
the
oppressive
pretrial
incarceration.
second,
to
minimize
pretrial
anxiety
and
concern
of
the
accused
and
third
to
limit
the
possibility
that
the
defense
will
be
impaired
by
the
loss
of
evidence.
it
is
obvious
that
no
remedy
whenever
offered
can
truly
undo
or
alleviate
the
annoyances
or
anxieties
that
a
defendant
may
have
suffered
while
awaiting
trial.
but
the
reversal
of
defendant's
conviction
after
trial
would
be
equally
as
effective
as
the
dismissal
of
indictment
before
trial
to
compensate
that
defendant
for
any
emotional
harm
he
may
have
suffered
and
it
will
also
be
equally
as
effective
as
a
means
of
punishing
the
government
for
the
delay.
similarly,
a
defendant's
interest
in
avoiding
a
conviction
based
on
lost
evidence
or
dimmed
memories
can
be
fully
protected
by
a
reversal
of
any
conviction
procured
after
a
period
of
unconstitutional
pretrial
delay.
thus
deferring
appeal
of
a
rejected
speedy
trial
claim
until
after
trial
presents
a
question
not
of
rights,
but
solely
of
remedies.
any
sixth
amendment
violation
can
be
remedied
as
well
after
trial
as
before.
now,
since
speedy
trial
claims
thus
do
not
satisfy
any
of
the
criteria
of
the
collateral
law
order
doctrine.
there
is
no
justification
for
countenancing
a
breach
of
the
normal
rules
against
interlocutory
appeals
and
criminal
cases
for
such
claims.
indeed
there
are
strong
reasons
why
in
our
view
would
be
a
especially
inappropriate
to
allow
defendants
to
take
interlocutory
remedy
appeals
from
the
district
courts
denial
of
their
speedy
trial
motions.
that
is
because
the
speedy
trial
clause
unlike
the
double
jeopardy
clause
or
indeed
unlike
any
of
the
other
protections
of
the
bill
of
rights.
it
is
designed
as
much
to
foster
the
interest
of
society
in
the
expeditious
resolution
of
criminal
cases
as
to
confer
protections
upon
individual
defendants.
this
court
observed
in
barker
v.
wingo
the
societal
interest
in
providing
a
speedy
trial
exist
not
only
separate
from
but
at
times
also
in
opposition
to
the
interest
of
the
accused.
thus,
even
if
some
of
the
interest
protected
by
the
speedy
trial
clause
might
be
furthered
by
allowing
pretrial
appellate
review
of
sixth
amendment
claims
in
a
occasional
case,
other
equally
important
interest
protected
by
the
clause
would
be
severely
frustrated
by
the
often
substantial
delays
in
the
disposition
of
criminal
cases
that
would
inevitably
accompany
such
appeals.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is
correct
but
under
section
1291,
under
section
3731
from
the
dismissal
of
indictment
and
that
clearly
is
a
final
order.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
there
is
nothing
further
that
would
happen
in
the
case
unless
an
appeal
were
to
be
pursued.
like
this
case
graphically
illustrates
the
point
that
i
was
making
about
delay.
the
district
court
denied
respondent's
motions
to
dismiss
the
indictment
in
july
1975
and
scheduled
his
trial
to
begin
a
few
weeks
later.
pretrial
litigation
of
respondent's
speedy
trial
claims
is
yet
to
be
resolved.
more
that
two
years
after
his
trial
would
have
ended
but
for
the
"piecemeal"
appeal.
in
addition
permitting
pretrial
appeal
of
speedy
trial
claims
would
allow
defendants
a
ready
method
of
obtaining
a
continuance
of
their
trials
and
delay
is
unfortunately
not
an
uncommon
defense
tactic.
we
have
recognized
of
course
that
this
court
in
abney
was
not
persuaded
by
the
argument
that
the
defendants
might
take
dilatory
appeals
in
double
jeopardy
cases.
the
court
believed
that
the
courts
of
appeals
could
easily
weed
out
and
dispose
summarily
of
truly
frivolous
kept
claims.
well,
this
is
perhaps
true
in
double
jeopardy
cases
there
are
two
reasons
why
it
is
exceedingly
unlikely
to
be
true
with
respect
to
speedy
trail
claims.
first
is
that
it
is
much
more
difficult
to
allege
a
plausible
double
jeopardy
violation,
there
must
be
some
showing
that
the
defendant
has
once
before
been
in
jeopardy
a
federal
conviction
on
the
same
or
related
charges.
very
few
defendants
could
make
or
even
approach
that
challenge.
by
contrast,
it
would
be
the
rare
defendant
who
could
not
present
the
colorable
speedy
trail
claims
since
they
will
be
in
every
case
some
period
of
delay
between
his
arrest
and
indictment
and
trail
and
possible
prejudices,
as
this
court
remarked
in
united
states
v.
marion
is
inherent
in
any
delay
however
short.
secondly,
it
is
much
easier
for
courts
of
appeals
to
spot
and
adjudicate
any
substantial
double
jeopardy
claim
quickly.
it
involves
merely
a
question
of
law
generally
on
undisputed
facts.
speedy
trail
claims
on
the
other
hand
call
for
a
delicate
and
often
difficult
case
by
case
assessment
of
a
number
of
variables
such
as
the
reasons
for
the
delay
and
the
prejudice
suffered
as
the
result
of
the
delay,
whether
these
factors
make
out
a
constitutional
violation
in
any
particular
case
may
not
be
possible
to
determine
without
the
aid
of
full
briefing
and
oral
argument.
in
short,
we
submit
that
speedy
trail
claims
are
precisely
the
type
of
claims
that
should
be
subject
to
the
final
judgment
rule
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
hearing
respondents
speedy
trail
appeal
prior
to
trail.
i
would
like
to
turn
briefly
the
few
minutes
remaining
to
the
merits
of
respondents.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
this
court
in
abney
was
faced
with
a
similar
situation,
in
abney
you
will
recall
not
only
was
there
an
appeal
of
the
double
jeopardy
claim
but
the
defendants
also
claimed
that
the
indictment
failed
to
state
an
offense.
the
district
court
denied
that
motion,
they
took
an
appeal
of
that.
also
before
trail
this
court
held
that
this
court
held
that
the
court
of
appeals
held
no
jurisdiction
over
that
aspect
of
the
defendants
appeal
because
each
issue
must
need
its
own
independent
appealability
standard
there
is
no
concept
of
pendent
jurisdiction
has
no
role
to
play
under
the
collateral
order
doctrine.
now,
as
to
the
merits
of
respondent's
sixth
amendment
claim
as
i
noted
at
the
outset
this
court
need
not
reach
it
if
it
agrees
with
us
that
the
court
below
lacked
jurisdiction
over
respondents
pretrial
appeal.
now,
the
court
of
appeal
acknowledged
and
indeed
as
respondent
concedes,
no
significant
delay
and
certainly
no
delay
approaching
constitutional
magnitude
occurred
in
this
case
between
january
1975,
when
respondent
was
indicted
in
august
1975
when
his
trail
was
set
to
begin.
court
of
appeals
holding
that
respondent
was
deprived
of
his
right
to
a
speedy
trail,
thus
plainly
rests
on
the
premise
that
respondent's
sixth
amendment
right
attached
in
the
spring
of
1970
when
he
was
arrested
by
the
army
and
that
is
right
continued
unabated
until
august
1975,
even
though
all
of
the
military
charges
against
respondent
had
been
dismissed
and
he
had
been
released
from
all
restrains
on
his
liberty
in
october
of
1970.
court
below
has
therefore
reached
the
insupportable
and
quite
incongruous
conclusion
that
in
the
four
years
between
the
dismissal
of
the
military
charges
against
respondent
and
his
indictment,
respondent
was
entitled
to
insist
upon
a
prompt
resolution
of
the
charges
against
them
and
the
federal
government
was
obliged
by
the
sixth
amendment
to
afford
him
a
speedy
trail
on
those
charges.
despite
the
fact
that
absolutely
no
criminal
charges
were
pending
against
him
during
any
part
of
that
period.
this
holding
we
submit
is
flatly
inconsistent
not
only
with
the
very
language
of
the
sixth
amendment
with
talks
about
an
accused
in
a
criminal
prosecution
but
also
with
analysis
of
that
provision
in
united
states
against
marion.
in
marion
the
court
held
that
the
particular
protections
of
the
sixth
amendment
did
not
extend
to
the
period
before
an
individual
had
been
formally
accused
of
a
crime
either
by
arrest
or
indictment.
even
though
that
individual
may
have
been
aware
for
an
extended
period
of
time
prior
to
his
indictment
that
he
was
under
official
investigation
and
even
though
he
may
have
suffered
severe
harmful
emotional
and
financial
consequences
as
a
result
of
that
investigation.
it
is
we
believe
the
logical
corollary
of
these
conclusion
that
as
defendant's
sixth
amendment
right
also
did
not
continue
after
a
criminal
proceeding
against
him
has
been
terminated
by
a
complete
dismissal
of
the
charges.
at
that
point
just
like
a
advance
of
formal
accusation
the
individual
does
not
stand
publicly
accused
of
any
crime
and
his
liberty
is
in
no
way
restricted.
his
situation,
as
the
court
observed
in
marion
does
not
compare
with
that
of
the
defendant
who
has
been
arrested
and
held
to
answer.
now
respondent's
only
response
to
these
arguments
is
the
assertion
that
his
case
is
essentially
indistinguishable
from
that
in
klopfer
against
north
carolina
in
386
us.
klopfer
however
presented
the
question
and
i
am
quoting
from
page
214
of
the
court's
opinion.
whether
authorities
“may
indefinitely
postpone
prosecution
on
an
incitement
without
stated
justification
over
the
objection
of
an
accused”.
the
unusual
north
carolina
procedure
in
klopfer
allowed
the
state
prosecutor
to
postpone
prosecution
indefinitely
on
an
incitement
that
he
did
not
wish
to
pursue
immediately.
the
upshot
was
that
since
the
indictment
was
not
dismissed
during
awaiting
period,
the
statute
of
limitations
remain
told
and
the
defendant
remained
under
formal
public
acquisition
and
under
the
constant
threat
of
prosecution
at
the
option
of
the
government.
this
court
held
that
the
state
procedure
violated
klopfer's
right
to
a
speedy
trial
but
only
because,
as
the
court
stated
at
page
222,
the
suspension
of
his
prosecution
“indefinitely
prolonged
the
oppression
as
well
as
the
anxiety
and
concern
accompanying
public
acquisition”.
respondent
of
course
was
under
any
public
acquisition
between
october
1970
and
january
1975,
nothing
in
klopfer
therefore
supports
an
extension
of
the
speedy
trial
clause
to
the
period
when
an
individual
is
not
the
subject
of
any
pending
criminal
charges.
i
should
add
one
final
point.
the
conclusion
that
respondent's
sixth
amendment
right
were
not
violated
by
the
five
year
period
between
the
murders
of
his
family
in
1970
and
his
indictment
for
those
crimes
in
1975,
certainly
does
not
suggest
that
the
propriety
of
that
delay
is
beyond
judicial
scrutiny.
there
is
first
the
protection
of
the
statute
of
limitations
which
is
of
course
the
primary
guarantee
against
the
bringing
of
overly
stale
criminal
charges
but
there
is
no
suggestion
that
the
statute
was
violated
here.
and
moreover
as
this
court
observed
in
marion
and
reaffirmed
last
term
in
united
states
against
lovasco,
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
is
an
additional
protection
against
unreasonable
pre
indictment
delay.
a
lengthy
delay
prior
to
acquisition
violates
due
process
if
it
causes
actual
prejudice
to
the
defense
and
if
the
government's
justification
for
the
delay
is
inadequate.
although
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
undertake
this
analysis,
we
believe
that
the
district
court
and
the
dissenting
judge
in
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
found
that
the
due
process
clause
was
not
violated
in
this
case.
indeed
respondent
does
not
contend
otherwise,
respondent
has
never
claimed
that
the
government's
delay
in
this
case
was
designed
to
prejudice
his
defense
or
was
occasioned
by
tactical
reasons
and
as
we
have
set
forth
that
some
length
in
our
main
and
reply
briefs,
there
is
not
the
slightest
proof
at
this
pretrial
stage
that
respondent's
defense
has
actually
been
prejudiced
by
the
delay.
we
therefore
submit
that
the
court
should
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
with
instructions
to
dismiss
respondent's
speedy
trial
claim
for
lack
of
jurisdiction,
so
that
this
case
may
finally
proceed
to
trial.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is
correct.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
mr.
chief
justice,
first
briefly
i
would
like
to
address
the
suggestion
that
the
government
somehow
been
inconsistent,
the
position
we
are
taking
in
this
case
and
the
position.
we
took
in
marion
that
whether
speedy
trial
claim
is
collateral.
threshold
issue
in
marion,
there
was
a
appealability
issue
whether
the
government
could
appeal
under
the
old
version
of
section
3731
and
that
in
turn
depended
upon
whether
the
district
court's
dismissal
of
the
indictment
had
resolved
any
issues
going
to
the
general
issue
in
the
case.
of
course,
a
speedy
trial
issue
is
collateral
to
the
issues
to
be
litigated
a
trial
in
the
sense
that
a
resolution
of
the
sixth
amendment
question
does
not
require
inquiry
and
the
truth
of
the
allegations
in
the
indictment.
but
we
think
the
court
must
have
meant
something
more
than
that
when
it
used
the
term
collateral
in
cohen
and
abney
or
else
virtually
any
pretrial
motion
to
dismiss
would
be
collateral
as
mr.
justice
marshall's
stated.
we
think
that
the
court
meant
that
an
issue
was
collateral
if
it
would
be
no
easier
to
resolve
the
issue
after
trial
than
before.
in
other
words
would
it
be
affected
in
any
way
by
the
decision
on
the
merits
of
the
case
and
speedy
trial
claims
would
be
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
if
the
defendant
is
acquitted
then
not
only
is
there
no
need
to
resolve
the
claim
but
it
goes
a
long
way
towards
suggesting
that
his
allegations
are
prejudice
were
not
substantial.
more
importantly
if
he
is
convicted
then
the
record,
the
trial
record
is
generally
indispensable
in
determining
whether
or
not
his
sixth
amendment
rights
have
been
violated
and
no
better
proof
of
this
need
be
offered
than
that
the
courts
of
appeals
almost
always
resolve
post
conviction
appeals
raising
speedy
trial
claims
by
reference
to
the
evidence
that
used
the
trial,
as
of
course
this
court
did
in
the
barker
v.
wingo
in
analyzing
barker
speedy
trial
claim.
now,
secondly,
its
true
that
the
remedy
for
a
speedy
trial
violation
is
dismissal
of
the
indictment
but
that
does
not
indicate
--
sixth
amendment
creates
a
so
called
right
not
to
be
tried.
the
difficulty
with
respondent's
reasoning
once
again
is
that,
dismissal
of
the
indictment
is
the
remedy
for
wide
range
of
violations
both
constitutional
and
non-constitutional
such
as
all
those
involving
defects
in
the
indictment.
if
interlocutory
appeals
would
have
been
allowed
in
each
of
these
cases
under
the
theory
that
the
nature
of
the
remedy
implies
a
right
not
to
be
tried,
then
the
collateral
order
exception
would
swallow
up
the
final
judgment
law
in
criminal
cases.
in
addition
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is
correct.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well
that
is
another,
of
course
another
reason
to
distinguish
it
but
even
there
we
had
to
show
that
the
sixth
amendment,
the
district
court's
resolution,
the
sixth
amendment
question
did
not
implicate
any
issues
going
to
guilt
or
innocence.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
and
secondly,
the
argument
that
the
nature
of
the
remedy
in
sixth
amendment
cases
implies
a
right
not
to
be
tried
is
inconsistent
with
this
court's
decision
last
term
in
abney.
as
i
mentioned
in
response
to
question
mr
justice
stevens
asked
me
initially,
in
that
case
in
addition
to
a
double
jeopardy
claim
the
defendants
also
raised
the
claim
that
their
indictment
failed
to
state
an
offense,
and
if
they
had
been
right
of
course
then
the
remedy
would
have
been
dismissal
of
the
indictment.
nonetheless,
this
court
held
that
is
not
the
type
of
claim
that
can
be
appealed
prior
to
trial.
finally,
i
would
like
to
discuss
the
reasons
for
the
delay
in
this
case
because
mr
segal
has
used
a
large
portion
of
his
argument
trying
to
explain
why
the
delay
was
unfair.
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
much
of
the
delay
in
this
case
was
attributable
to
the
strong
feeling
on
the
part
of
many
persons
in
the
criminal
division
of
the
department
of
justice.
the
charges
are
serious
as
the
ones
in
this
case,
simply
should
not
be
brought
unless
the
government
was
absolutely
convinced
that
they
would
ultimately
prove
successful.
to
begin
with,
we
are
not
talking
about
a
five
year
delay.
no
one
has
ever
claimed
that
the
department
of
justice
unduly
delayed
before
june
of
'72
when
it
received
the
c.i.d's
report
of
its
reinvestigation
of
the
crimes,
and
its
decision
with
regard
to
grand
jury
was
made
in
the
summer
of
'74
and
respondent
was
indicted
in
january
of
1975
so
essentially
talking
about
two
or
two-and-half
year
period,
now
during
that
two
or
two-and-a-half
years
there
were
two
prevailing
views
within
the
government.
one
group
of
attorneys
thought
that
the
case
should
be
brought
to
a
grand
jury
immediately
with
the
view
towards
bringing
charges
against
respondent.
another
group
of
attorneys
while
also
convinced
that
respondent
was
guilty,
frankly
could
not
believe
that
we
could
convince
a
jury
with
that.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well
both
in
resolving
a
sixth
amendment
trial
claim
and
a
fifth
amendment
pre-indictment
delay
claim,
the
court
must
have
of
course
analyze
the
reasons
for
the
delay
of--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well
i
think
that
there
is
a
record
to
support
some
of
the
statements
i
am
about
to
make.
these
statements
were
made
in
oral
argument
before
both
of
the
lower
courts
in
this
case.
one
of
the
reasons
i
might
say
that
there
is
no
record
in
this
case
is
that
we
think
the
district
court
incorrectly
analyzed
this
case
is
not
raising
any
sixth
amendment
issues
at
all
because
of
the
four
year
delay
between
the
crimes
in
january
1975,
respondent
was
not
under
any
formal
accusation
so
he
quickly
dismissed
any
sixth
amendment
argument
without
inquiring--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes
we
do.
i
just
wanted
to
give
the
court
the
impression
that
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
the
files
laid
in
some
dusty
cabinet
for
four
years
with
no
one
looking
after
the
case
at
all.
that
certainly
the
impression
the
respondent
tries
to
give
during
every
moment
from
june
of
1972
until
an
indictment
was
procured
in
this
case.
someone
in
the
department
of
justice
was
trying
to
push
this
case
further
but
for
reasons
that
i
was
about
to
get
into
a
number
of
the
superiors
in
the
department
thought
that
the
case
should
not
be
brought
unless
they
could
be
absolutely
certain
that
the
jury
would
convict
and
they
had
trouble
believing
that
jury
would
convict
not
because
they
did
not
think
respondent
was
guilty
but
because
of
the
nature
of
the
crimes,
who
the
victims
were
plus
the
fact
that
the
government's
evidence--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well
i
merely
wanted
to
give
the
court
the
impression
that
there
is
in
our
view
no
substance
to
the
allegation
that
the
fourth
circuit
made
that
the
government
proceeded
at
a
leisurely
pace
or
respondent's
suggestions
that
the
government
was
guilty
of
negligence
or
ineptitude,
a
point
that
i
wanted
to
make
and
i
close
by
saying
that
in
our
view
the
delay
here
was
intended
to
protect
respondent's
rights
by
not
bringing
unfair
charges.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
and
district
court.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well
mr.
justice
stevens
the
facts
that
i
was
about
to
present
were
not
disputed
by
anyone
in
the
district
court
or
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well
its
not
just
in
a
appellate
court--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well
that
defending
what
happened
in
the
lovasco
case
mr.
justice
stevens,
these
allegations
were
made
to
the
district
court.
if
the
district
court
had
thought
they
were
not
in
any
way
contested,
he
could
well
have
held
an
evidentiary
hearing
but
as
i
was
about
to
say
there
has
been
no
allegation
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
thank
you.
