justice
thurgood
marshall
in
number
76-1346
lorillard
is
here
from
the
fourth
circuit,
court
of
appeals
of
the
fourth
circuit.
in
this
case,
the
question
is
whether
there
is
a
right
to
jury
trial
in
private
civil
actions
for
lost
wages
under
the
age
discrimination
and
employment
act
of
1967.
respondent
brought
this
suit
against
petitioner
former
employer
alleging
that
she
had
been
discharged
because
of
her
age
in
violation
of
the
act.
she
demanded
a
jury
trial
on
a
claim,
but
the
trial
court
ruled
that
she
had
no
right
to
a
jury
trial.
on
appeal
that
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
respondent
had
both
the
statutory
and
the
constitutional
right
to
a
jury
trial.
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
the
conflict
in
the
circuits
on
this
issue.
by
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
hold
that
the
respondent
did
have
a
statutory
right
to
a
jury
trial
on
the
claim
for
lost
wages
and
we
therefore
do
not
reach
the
constitutional
question.
although
there
is
no
provision
in
the
act
to
express
the
relating
to
jury
trials,
the
structure
of
the
act
demonstrates
the
congressional
intent
to
grant
a
right
to
a
jury
trial.
first
congress
incorporated
the
procedures
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
under
which
jury
trials
have
been
afforded
as
a
matter
of
right.
moreover,
by
expressly
providing
for
legal
relief
in
the
age
discrimination
act,
we
believe
that
congress
evidenced
its
intention
that
jury
trial
be
made
available
on
demand.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
accordingly
affirmed.
mr.
justice
blackmun
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
discussion
of
this
case.
