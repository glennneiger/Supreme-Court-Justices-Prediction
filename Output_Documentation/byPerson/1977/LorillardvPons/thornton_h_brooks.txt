mr.
thornton
h.
brooks
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
members
of
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
fourth
circuit
to
review
the
question,
whether
a
discharged
employee
who
brings
action
against
her
former
employee
under
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act
and
seeks
as
recovery,
reinstatement
to
her
position
and
monetary
damages
in
the
form
of
back
pay,
is
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
under
that
act
or
under
the
seventh
amendment.
the
facts
are
briefly
stated
in
the
complaint
and
that
is
what
we
are
proceeding
on
in
this
case,
is
that
plaintiff
was
a
48
year-old
employee
of
the
defendant
company
and
was
terminated
from
her
employment.
it
is
alleged
that
this
discharge
was
because
of
her
age
and
was
a
part
of
the
company's
policy
to
terminate
where
possible
older
employees
and
retain
where
possible
younger
employees.
plaintiff
made
a
timely
demand
for
jury
trial
and
defendant
moved
to
strike
the
jury
demand.
the
district
court
granted
the
motion
to
strike
the
demand,
principally
basing
his
ruling
on
the
rationale
that
a
age
discrimination
act
was
akin
to
or
parallel
with
title
7
discrimination
of
account
of
race,
sex,
national
origin
and
religion.
an
interlocutory
appeal
was
granted
by
the
fourth
circuit
and
that
court
reversed
the
opinion
of
the
district
court,
therefore
basis
of
the
opinion
of
the
circuit
court,
number
one,
it
found
in
the
language
of
the
adea,
those
words
'legal
relief'
or
'equitable
relief'
as
making
a
distinction
in
the
title
7
cases
and
the
court
further
found
or
held
that
the
opinion
that
curtis
v.
loether
mandated
that
kind
of
a
ruling
that
being
a
title
8
case.
third,
the
court
felt
that
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
right
this
was
--
they
were
entitled
to
recover
on
that
basis.
the
sixth
circuit
in
morelock
v.
ncr
corp,
held
to
the
contrary
and
petition
was
granted.
i
might
state
that
pending
the
case
before
the
court
of
appeal,
plaintiff
filed
a
motion
in
that
court
to
have
the
case
remanded
after
disposition
before
the
fourth
circuit
to
permit
plaintiff
to
amend
her
complaint
to
allege
that
her
termination
caused
her
embarrassment,
anxiety
and
constituted
grounds
for
common
law
of
punitive
damages.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
since
that
matter
had
been
raised
for
the
first
time
before
that
court,
it
should
properly
be
raised
only
upon
remand,
it
did
not
find
it
necessary
to
pass
on
the
question
of
whether
asking
for
punitive
damages
in
an
adea
complaint
made
any
difference.
mr.
thornton
h.
brooks
no,
sir,
i
would
take
he
could
do
that,
he
could
have
a
bifurcated
trial.
mr.
thornton
h.
brooks
i
would
think
on
the
substantive
issue
of
whether
the
act
had
been
violated.
mr.
thornton
h.
brooks
right
sir.
and
so
it
is
our
position
that
first
we
have
to
look
at
the
legislative
act,
the
adea
to
see
if
it
provides
for
a
jury
trial,
if
so
we
do
not
have
to
reach
the
constitutional
issue.
the
act
itself
has
no
expressed
language
that
even
tangent
of
the
late
deals
with
the
matter
of
the
jury
trial.
it's
utterly
silent
on
the
question
of
the
jury
trial.
in
so
far
as
the
legislative
history
is
concerned
it
does
not
even
rise
to
the
extent
of
being
ambiguous.
there
is
no
legislative
history
with
respect
to
the
jury
trial
aspect
of
the
case.
there
is
a
legislative
history
about
the
purpose
of
the
act,
and
we
consider
that
the
legislative
purpose
in
enacting
the
act
was
to
fill
in
the
gap
of
employment
discrimination
areas
that
were
not
covered.
it
already
covered
eight,
i
mean,sex,
race,
sex,
religion,
national
origin
and
age
was
being
to
be
a
proper
subject
to
prohibit
discrimination
in
that
field.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
title
7
has
a
provision
authorizing
the
section.
secretory
of
labor
to
make
a
investigation
and
report
back
to
congress
on
the
needs
for
that
legislation,
and
that
was
done.
mr.
thornton
h.
brooks
certainly,
in
so
far,
if
it
provided
for
punitive
damages
as
it
does
in
title
8.
mr.
thornton
h.
brooks
we
say
'no'
because
we
say
under
the
teachings
of
title
7
cases,
that's
an
incident
to
the
equitable
relief.
the
main
relief
in
the
adea
cases
in
title
7
is
reinstatement,
that
is
mrs.
pons
wants.
she
wants
to
get
back
her
job.
the
matter
compensating
her
for
lost
wages
and
earnings
--
she
of
course,
didn't
presume
that
but
her
main
request
and
her
main
interest
in
this
litigation
is
to
be
restored
to
her
position.
mr.
thornton
h.
brooks
yes,
in
the
form
of
back
pay,
which
is
what
the
typical
title
7
case
is.
mr.
thornton
h.
brooks
not
directly
this
--
there
was
some
suggestion
that
it
be
amendment
to
title
7
and
just
include
age
along
with
the
other
categories
but
there
was
also
some
suggestion
that
before
the
committees
that
the
eeoc
which
was
charged
with
the
administration
of
title
7
was
so
behind
in
its
caseload,
that
it
would
be
better
to
entrust
this
to
the
secretory
of
labor
which
presumably
had
more
time
and
could
handle
this
aspect
of
it,
but
that
would
be
the
only
indication
in
there
that
as
to
why
that
was
in
the
separate
act.
some
of
the
commentators
have
suggested
that
there
maybe
not
a
legal
distinction
but
a
psychological
distinction
between
discrimination
on
account
of
age
and
on
account
of
these
other
factors.
mr.
thornton
h.
brooks
right
sir,
and
it
is
subject
to
everyone.
mr.
thornton
h.
brooks
indeed
sir,
and
congress
now
is
contemplating
moving
it
up
because
it
figured
that
it's
holding
the
clock
back,
i
suppose.
so
we
contend
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
act,
even
indirectly
that
speaks
to
whether
there
should
be
a
jury
trail.
arguably
we
say
that
congress
did
not
intend
or
contemplate
one,
otherwise
it
could
have
said
so.
in
title
7,
where
they
speak
a
jury
trial
in
contempt
cases,
they
expressly
provide
that
the
party
is
entitled
to
jury
trial
in
that
instant
and
so
we
say
that
they
could
have
said
so
in
this
case
if
that
had
been
their
intent.
mr.
thornton
h.
brooks
no
sir,
because
curtis
v.
loether,a
title
8
case
did
not
provide,
and
we
consider
that
that
case
was
correct
what
they
decided
because
of
the
wording
of
that
statute.
but
then
we
would
move
to
the
constitutional
issue
and
we
would
stand
on
this
very
concise
proposition
that
set
forth
in
the
latest
case
of
this
court
pernell
v.
southall
realty,
where
justice
marshall
said
that
trial
by
jury
and
actions
unheard
of
a
common
law
permitted
by
are
required
by
the
seventh
amendment
provided
that
the
action
involves
rights
and
remedies
of
this
sort
traditionally
enforced
in
the
action
at
law
rather
than
in
an
action
at
equity
or
admity
and
all
difference
between
the
parties
in
this
case
is
whether
this
is
an
action
that
traditionally
would
be
brought
in
equity
or
in
law.
mr.
thornton
h.
brooks
right
sir.
mr.
thornton
h.
brooks
because,
to
come
within
the
seventh
amendment
must
not
only
have
a
right
but
you
must
have
remedies,
in
the
conjunction
and
not
disjunctive
and
the
remedies
in
these
cases
are
injunctive
and
the
claim
back
pay
is
merely
an
incident
to
the
main
thrust
of
the
action
which
is
restoring
the
person
to
the
previous
condition,
whereas
in
the
breach
of
contract,
that
is
a
action
for
a
judgment
that
would
be
enforced
by
writ
of
attachment
or
by
--
mr.
thornton
h.
brooks
if
she
had
for
example,
a
specific
contract
that
was
a
breach,
i
mean,
i
were
told
that
you
would
be
employed
for
a
certain
length
of
time
and
they
terminated
before
that
is
distinguished
from
termination
at
will
which
is
a
type
of
situation
we
are
dealing
with
here,
i
would
say
she
would
be
entitled
to
the
jury
trial
on
the
contract
plot
and
her
measure
of
damages
would
be
different,
her
remedy
would
be
different.
mr.
thornton
h.
brooks
no
sir,
because
mrs.
pons's
action
is
based
entirely
on
the
adea,
not
at
all
on
any
common
law,
not
on
any
contract.
mr.
thornton
h.
brooks
that
causes
trouble
to
the
court,
i
might
say
this
--
mr.
thornton
h.
brooks
it
certainly
does
sir.
mr.
thornton
h.
brooks
i
really
don't
think
so.
mr.
thornton
h.
brooks
but
that
would
be
the
only
type
of
those
situation
under
this
if
she
is
asking
for
promotion
which
is
a
frequent
thing
or
she
is
asking
to
be
hired
which
is
a
frequent
cause
of
action
or
she
is
asking
for
difference
in
pay
because
she
was
discriminated
there
on
account
of
age,
all
of
those
things
can
take
injunctive
relief
or
declaratory
relief
to
a
thing.
mr.
thornton
h.
brooks
you
could,
yes
sir,
i
would
suggest
--
mr.
thornton
h.
brooks
well,
if
you
could
not
find
justification
in
the
curtis
against
lother
on
the
basis
of
this
statute,
i
hardly
say,
i
could
find
it
here.
because
there
is
no
basis
--
well,
there
is
that
language
of
legal
remedies,
present
in
this
case
that
is
not
in
there.
i
might
say
that
this
matter
does
trouble
the
trial
court
since
the
handing
down
of
the
decision
in
this
case,
in
the
morelock
case,
there
have
been
a
number
of
district
court
decisions,
some
following
the
teaching
in
lorilard
case
and
some
following
the
teaching
in
morelock,
so
it's
not
an
easy
proposition
and
only
last
week
this
court
denied
certiorari
in
case
of
(inaudible)
v.
delaware
which
was
a
title
7
case
where
request
to
jury
trial
was
turned
down
and
not
that
--
not
granting
the
certiorari
means
anything
but
the
courts
are
looking
to
this
court
for
guidance
on
whether
in
discrimination
litigations,
party
is
entitled
to
trial
and
if
it
is
our
basic
position
that
when
you
finally
analyze
the
cases,
there
is
no
real
difference
from
the
standpoint
of
remedies
and
rights
in
an
action
brought
under
title
7
in
adea.
mr.
thornton
h.
brooks
yes
sir,
they
would
and
we
say
that
--
mr.
thornton
h.
brooks
yes
sir,
and
one
of
the
arguments
is
that
that's
exactly
what
they
did
not
there
--
mr.
thornton
h.
brooks
and
they
can
correct
however
--
mr.
thornton
h.
brooks
right
sir.
the
one
further
point
that
i
think
needs
to
be
stressed
is
that
if
we
read
the
cases
and
as
many
of
the
lower
court
read
the
cases
that
--
where
the
relief
is
merely
incident
to
on
an
--
the
remedies
merely
incident
to
the
equitable
relief
that
you
do
not
have
to
have
a
trial
by
jury
and
language
in
moody
v.
albemarle
paper
co.
and
the
language
in
boman
transportation,
we
think
clearly
say
that
back
wages,
lost
wages
do
not
have
to
automatically
be
granted
and
within
the
discretion
of
the
court
and
therefore
they
are
merely
an
incident
to
the
main
relief
asked
for
and
it
is
not
cited
in
our
brief
but
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
latest
announcement
of
this
court
on
the
matter
of
jury,
is
in
atlas
roofing
company
which
was
in,
march
of
this
year
and
as
i
read
footnote
number
10,
it
says
that
going
back
to
jones
&
laughlin,
this
is
an
alternate
ground,
it's
a
separate
ground
as
to
whether
or
not
that
that
case
was
based
on,
that
recovery
of
money
damages
is
an
incident
to
the
non-legal
relief
even
though
damages
might
have
been
recovered
in
an
action
at
law.
i
would
like
to
reserve
a
few
minutes
for
reply.
mr.
thornton
h.
brooks
one
or
two
words
on
the
matter
of
liquidated
damages
to
which
we
were
just
devoting
our
attention.
mr.
smith,
before
the
district
court
and
was
so
interpreted
before
the
court
of
appeals
that
he
made
no
claim
that
that
issue
was
triable
by
jury,
that's
found
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
in
the
decisions
of
the
courts.
before
the
district
court
had
in
footnote
two
on
page
8a
and
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
page
2a,
in
footnote
three
where
it
states
this
appeal
involves
only
the
right
to
jury
trial
on
the
claim
of
lost
wages.
mr.
smith
has
stated
that
in
our
argument
we
had
made
no
mention
about
the
wording
and
the
act
of
legal
relief.
i
might
say
that
without
exaggeration
that
adea
is
not
a
hallmark
of
clarity.
they
have
the
language
in
that
that
says
you
can
enforce
the
liability
for
amounts
deemed
to
the
unpaid
minimum
wages
or
unpaid
overtime
compensation
under
this
section.
they
make
that
statement
in
two
places
in
section
7b,
and
there's
no
way
possible
that
you
can
have
unpaid
wages
or
overtime
compensation
under
a
adea
case.
this
was
barred
from
the
language
of
flsa
case,
the
standard
case
where
the
only
issue
was
the
employee
paid
the
minimum
wages
if
not,
they
were
entitled
to
a
definite
amount
to
bring
that
wages
up
to
the
minimum
wage.
if
the
other
part
of
the
overtime
compensation
under
the
fairly
the
standards
act,
if
you
worked
over
40
hours
and
did
not
pay
time
and
they
have
to
regulerate
those
hours,
you
are
automatically
entitled
to
a
judgment
for
that
amount.
that
was
a
fixed
amount
that
not
capable
of
ascertainment
within
the
discretion
of
any
court.
furthermore,
my
brother
mr.
smith
says
that
we
do
not
discuss
what
legal
relief
means,
i
would
call
his
attention,
the
court's
attention
to
his
opposition
for
the
petition
for
certiorari
on
page
7
in
the
third
paragraph,
when
he
states
that
“the
term
legal
relief
set
out
in
the
age
discrimination
and
employment
act
clearly
relates
to
the
enumerated
remedy
of
'enforcing
the
liability
for
amounts
deemed
to
the
unpaid
minimum
wages
or
unpaid
overtime
compensation
under
this
section',
and
also
may
relate
to
other
types
of
legal
claims
such
as
common
law
damage
claims
which
are
not
specifically
enumerated
in
the
statute”.
but
we
are
not
dealing
with
unpaid
minimum
wages
or
overtime,
we
are
dealing
with
a
claim
for
back
wages,
lost
wages,
and
in
conclusion
i
would
say
that
we
--
if
a
jury
trial
is
permissible
in
an
adea
case,
and
is
not
permissible
in
the
title
7
case,
we
end
up
in
the
anomalous
situation
that
mrs.
pons
being
a
female,
an
old
age
party
could
have
coupled
both
actions
in
both
claims
in
her
complaint
and
she
would
have
been
entitled
to
a
jury
trail
and
therefore
but
if
she
brought
only
a
title
7
case,
she
would
not
have
been.
we
feel
that
this
is
all
a
part
of
congress's
intent
to
put
discrimination
cases
in
the
same
basket
or
category
and
the
same
kind
of
result
should
obtain
with
respect
to
whether
her
part
is
entitled
to
a
jury
trail.
thank
you
sir.
