mr.
norman
b.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
read
the
briefs
of
petitioner
and
its
amicus
with
care
and
listened
to
oral
argument
to
try
to
see
if
there
was
some
way
that
the
meaning
of
a
statute
when
it
says
legal
or
equitable
relief
could
be
rendered
nugatory
and
i
have
failed
to
find
that.
i
think
that
the
third,
fourth
and
fifth
circuits
are
correct
and
the
sixth
circuit
is
wrong
in
the
way
in
which
the
lower
courts
have
dealt
with
this
jury
trial
question.
the
statute
clearly
says
legal
or
equitable
relief
can
be
awarded.
the
statute
goes
on
to
give
certain
examples
of
all
types
of
relief,
examples
set
forth
in
the
statute
of
equitable
relief
include
compelling
employment,
reinstatement
and
promotion
and
to
me,
the
example
of
legal
relief
that
the
stature
on
its
face
contains
is
enforcing
liability
for
amounts
deemed,
unpaid
minimum
wages
or
unpaid
overtime
compensation,
and
in
doing
this
the
court
has
--
the
congress
has
incorporated
by
reference,
section
260
in
the
private
remedy
provision
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
the
lower
court
cases
over
the
last
30
years
interpreting
the
section
216
are
unanimous
in
holding
that
a
jury
trial
right
does
obtain
under
the
statute.
we
feel
that
this
judicial
construction
history
must
have
been
in
the
mind
of
congress
when
it
passed
the
law
that
we
have
here,
when
it
was
incorporated
by
reference.
we
feel
that
not
only
do
we
have
the
items
of
relief
deemed,
unpaid
minimum
wages
or
unpaid
overtime
compensation,
not
only
do
we
have
these
forms
of
relief
as
legal
relief
but
we
feel
that
other
forms
of
relief
provided
by
the
statute
or
the
statute
as
interpreted
by
the
courts
would
also
be
legal
relief.
among
these
would
be
included
in
my
view
the
statutory
liquidated
damages
which
is
posited
on
a
finding
of
willfulness.
i
further
feel
that
actual
damages
or
payment
suffering
an
injury
to
reputation
maybe
recoverable
under
the
statute
and
furthermore
that
common
law
of
punitive
damages
maybe
recoverable
under
the
law.
the
court
of
course
does
not
need
to
reach
the
question
as
to
precisely
what
kinds
of
damages
are
recoverable
because
that
does
not
arise
in
the
scope
of
this
case.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
your
honor
please,
i
do
not.
i
think
that
those
cases
are
wrongly
decided
but
that's
a
personal
view
and
i
think
that
one
could
rule
in
my
favor
under
the
adea
and
still
rule
with
the
lower
courts
under
the
title
7.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes
your
honor.
i
do.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
to
me
there's
one
that's
more
significant
and
that
is
related
to
the
question
which
was
asked
to
mr.
brooks,
a
few
moments
ago
about
the
process
of
aging
being
something
that
we
all
have
to
encounter.
i
think
we
find
in
our
society
that
we
don't
have
a
pervasive
prejudice
against
elderly
people,
mindless
sort
of
a
prejudice
that
we
found
against
persons
of
alien
extraction
or
persons
of
minority
races
that
we
dealt
with
in
title
7.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
that's
somewhat
different
type
of
prejudice
but
because
our
society
is
one
that's
dominated
by
males,
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
this
is
a
type
of
prejudice
which
is
very
pervasive
and
very
malevolent
and
often
very
hard
to
detect.
and
i
suppose
the
framers
of
title
7
felt
that
because
such
prejudices
are
so
widely
here,
there
might
be
jury
nullification
of
the
law.
this
is
suggested
in
some
of
the
legislative
history
as
well
as
in
some
of
the
law
review
articles
that
have
been
published
on
the
subject.
i
am
of
the
view
that
--
same
view
that
was
expressed
by
this
court
in
curtis
v.
loether
that
such
considerations
cannot
overwrite
the
seventh
amendment
but
i
again
emphasize
that
that
is
not
the
case
that
the
court
has
before
it
and
happily
we
don't
seem
to
be
concerned
with
jury
nullification
because
all
the
plaintiffs
in
age
cases
want
jurys
and
all
the
defendants
don't
want
jurys.
i
don't
feel
that
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well
i
think
opinions
differ
there
your
honor
of
course,
15
years
ago,
12
years
ago
when
the
statute
was
first
enacted,
i
think
most
of
us
felt
that
the
jurys
would
tend
to
nullify
particularly
in
this
all.
my
own
views
are
now
that
as
a
primarily
a
plaintiffs
attorney,
i
just
assume
to
have
a
jury
trail
under
title
7
case,
as
any
other
kind
of
case,
in
fact
i
prefer
to
but
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
your
honor,
reading
atlas
roofing
and
jones
lauglin,
i
mean,
i
cant
be
compelled
to
say
no.
i
think
that
we
could
take
very
large
spheres
of
newly
created
rights
and
put
them
before
administrative
tribunes,
i
think
special
courts
of
equity
i
think
maybe
mr.
justice
white
characterized,
i
mean,
i
have
seen
in
one
of
his
opinion.
i
am
troubled
by
that
if
i
saw
too
much
of
it
going
on,
if
i
saw
it
too
much
in
the
way
of
classic
or
legal
rights
and
remedies
becoming
institutionalized
in
the
administrative
process,
i
would
be
disturbed
that
a
very
great
in
run
around
the
seventh
amendment
were
being
made
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes
sir,
but
of
course
this
right
now
it
has
been
in
existence
for
10
years
and
if
we
were
to
suddenly
take
this
right
and
make
a
one
that's
determined
solely
in
a
administrative
context,
it
would
be
to
some
degree
troublesome
to
me.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
but
wasn't
it
true
your
honor
that
the
defenses
were
so
merely
absolute
to
those
claims
that
the
claims
before
the
common
law
courts
were
for
the
most
part
not
worth
pursuing.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i
know
that,
but,
my
point
is
that
the
assumption,
there
is
going
to
fill
a
certain
rule
and
all
those
things
were
so
pervasive
that
it
was
essentially
impossible
for
the
workmen
to
have
an
effective
common
law
claim
but
i
certainly
agree
with
you
your
honor
that
the
are
instances
where
it
has
been
done
and
it
has
been
upheld
by
the
courts
happily.
we
don't
have
such
a
difficult
question.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
i
haven't
thought
about
that
your
honor,
my
initial
reaction
would
be
that
was
good,
for
the
goose
and
ought
to
be
good
for
the
gander
in
such
instances
but
i
--
that's
a
difficult
question
and
i
am
really
not
equipped
to
respond
to
it.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
surely.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
i
am
very
strongly
of
the
opinion
that
there
are
limitations
on
the
power
of
congress
to
deny
litigants
their
seventh
amendment
rights.
they
may
have
done
so
under
title
7
happily
that
case
is
not
here.
we
respectfully
contend
that
because
legal
relief
is
set
forth
on
the
face
of
the
statute
and
illustrative
types
of
legal
relief
are
also
set
forth.
we
don't
think
that
there
is
any
reason
for
the
court
to
engage
in
the
statutory
construction
by
using
extrinsic
aids
to
construction
and
hence
we
see
no
reason
for
the
court
even
to
look
at
title
7
in
this
case,
but
where
the
court
to
do
so,
the
differences
between
the
statutes
are
very
dramatic.
under
title
7
congress
went
to
considerable
length
to
deliberately
exclude
jury
trials.
the
statute
allows
only
for
equitable
relief
on
its
face.
the
statutory
history
including
the
floor
debates
and
committee
reports
are
replete
with
statements
that
there
will
be
no
trial
by
jury
except
in
the
narrow
area
of
criminal
contempts
that
came
in
pursuant
to
the
dirksen-mansfield
series
of
amendments.
also
it's
instructive
that
back
pay
under
the
title
7
is
said
maybe
awarded
by
the
court
and
not
that
it
must
be
that
but
that
it
maybe
to
discretionary
matter
whereas
the
amounts
deemed
unpaid
minimum
wages
and
unpaid
overtime
compensation
apparently
must
be
awarded
by
the
way
the
age
discrimination
act
is
phrased.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
that
is
not
automatic
your
honor,
it
requires
a
finding
of
willfulness.
liquidated
damages
can
be
granted
if
the
trial
or
fact
determines
that
the
defendants
was
willful.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes
sir,
and
it's
very
important
to
note
that
the
portal
act
provision
which
allow
similar
liquidated
damages
under
the
flsa
was
not
carried
forward
into
age
act,
under
the
portal
act
there's
a
discretionary
provision.
the
court
had
discretion
to
grant
or
deny
liquidated
damages
depending
on
whether
or
not
the
court
finds
the
defendant
acted
in
good
faith.
here
i
think,
congress
is
telling
us,
let's
let
the
jury
decide
whether
or
not
the
defendants
was
willful
because
the
word
discretion
nowhere
appears
on
the
face
of
the
age
act
and
the
portal
act
was
not
incorporated
by
reference
as
many
of
the
other
provisions
of
the
flsa
were,
turning
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
the
fourth
circuit
appears
to
join
with
virtually
all
other
courts
holding
that
there
is
no
jury
trail
right,
and
they
have
even
done
so
in
some
employment
discrimination
cases
arising
under
1983.
i
don't
think
those
cases
any
longer
can
be
sustained
in
light
of
the
fourth
circuit's
decision
in
pons.
i
am
saying
those
public
employment
cases,
i
am
not
saying,
of
course
of
title
7
cases
which
is
a
different
animal.
turning
briefly
to
the
constitutional
issue
which
i
don't
think
the
court
really
needs
to
reach,
i
think
it's
a
statutory
construction
problem
but
nonetheless
the
court
should
consider
the
constitutionality
of
jury
trail
in
this
case,
we
would
say
that
this
appears
to
be
certainly
one
of
those
cases
in
which
the
seventh
amendment
requires
a
jury
trial
to
be
given.
i
think
what
the
petitioners
are
tempting
to
do
here
is
to
reinstate
the
now
defunct
equitable
cleanup
doctrine
and
to
ask
that
the
damages
consisting
of
lost
wages
be
tried
as
an
adjunct
to
the
claim
for
equitable
relief.
this
clearly
said
in
beacon
theaters
and
ross
v.
bernhard
that
the
right
to
jury
trail
will
not
be
lost
by
trial
of
the
equitable
issues
to
the
court
in
treating
the
legal
issues
merely
as
an
incidental
to
them.
in
ross,
there
were
the
three
tests
identified
for
the
purpose
of
assisting
the
court
in
establishing
whether
jury
trials
must
be
granted
or
not
in
a
given
context,
one
was
whether
the
claim
was
legal
or
equitable.
i
take
it
the
petitioner
really
doesn't
raise
much
of
an
issue
here,
i
think
the
petitioner
essentially
concedes
that
respondent's
claim
is
a
legal
claim
because
it
so
neatly
fits
in
to
the
common
law
analog
of
the
breach
of
contract
of
employment
in
the
action
for
damages,
as
a
result
there
are
and
further
taking
a
suggestion
from
this
court's
decision
in
curtis
v.
loether,
i
suppose
one
could
also
say
that
a
new
statutory
tort
was
created
consisting
of
discrimination
in
employment
and
that
this
is
somewhat
akin
to
the
common
law
cause
of
action
for
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress
which
is
to
tried
on
the
law
side
and
not
on
the
equitable
side.
i
find
no
pre-merger
equitable
antecedent
to
the
cause
of
action
here.
the
second
inquiry
required
by
ross
is
whether
the
remedy
is
legal
or
equitable
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
remedy
here
sought
is
a
legal
one,
at
least
the
remedy
for
lost
wages.
petitioner
argued
that
reinstatement
was
the
primary
relief
sought
by
the
respondent,
that's
not
necessarily
so.
two
years
have
gone
by
now
and
it's
really
not
necessarily
true
that
by
the
time
this
case
ultimately
comes
to
trail
the
respondent
will
either
wish
to
or
be
in
a
position
to
try
and
have
her
job
back.
and
certainly
it's
conceptually
possible
that
that
would
be
--
that
claim
would
be
withdrawn
before
the
action
comes
to
trial.
what
respondent
has
particularly
asked
for
here
is
her
damages
consisting
of
lost
wages.
this
is
a
classic
legal
remedy.
the
lost
wages
under
the
age
act
are
not
discretionary
as
petitioner
argues.
they
are
mandated
by
the
act.
the
act
uses
the
word
shall
and
not
may
and
it
incorporates
all
of
this
history
of
construction
under
the
flsa,
all
of
which
holds
that
such
damages
are
automatic
and
calculable
with
precision.
furthermore
the
claims
for
punitive
or
liquidated
damages
are
historically
unavailable
and
equally
unavailable
on
the
law
side
and
these
remedies
as
well
would
indicate
that
our
claim
here
is
want
to
be
tried
by
jury.
the
third
and
final
element
expressed
in
ross
is
whether
the
action
could
be
managed
as
a
jury
case
given
their
practical
limitations,
we
would
respectfully
submit
that
this
type
cases
are
ideal
for
resolution
by
jury
as
justice
stevens
noted
in
the
curtis
case
at
the
circuit
court
level,
such
cases
as
these
deal
primarily
with
motive
and
credibility
which
are
classic
issues
for
jury
resolution.
computation
of
damages
is
relatively
simple
and
straightforward
and
even
in
our
own
district
we
have
the
history
that
two
cases
have
been
tried
by
jury
and
that
then
this
case
came
along
and
the
jury
demand
was
stricken
so
we
know
that
you
can't
try
these
cases
by
jury
because
in
our
district,
we
tried
two
of
them,
in
fact
i
was
counsel
for
plaintiff.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
your
honor
please,
we
prayed
in
the
initial
complaint
from
statutory
liquidated
damages
before
the
circuit
court
we
saw
who
had
other
prayers
for
relief
for
common
law
punitive
damages
and
for
actual
damages,
other
than
back
pay,
are
damages
for
injury
to
reputation,
mental
suffering
and
that
sort
of
thing.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
no,
your
honor
but
i
saw
the
lower
courts
going
off
in
all
kinds
of
different
directions
in
these
cases
deciding
in
different
ways
depending
on
the
prayers
for
relief.
i
wanted
to
have
the
whole
thing
in
front
of
a
court
and
to
get
it
resolved.
and
the
circuit
court
decided
to
let
it
go
back
to
the
district
court
for
ruling
on
that
motion,
of
course
we
have
not
been
back
there
because
we
came
up
here.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
if
we
simply
prayed
for
reinstatement
and
no
monetary
relief?
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
that
would
be
tried
on
equity
side.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
but
i
think
under
ross
v.
bernhard
and
the
dairy
queen
and
those
cases
that
if
you
ask
for
any
legal
relief
that
determines
how
the
case
is
going
to
be
handled.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
so,
what
i
was
saying,
i
think
there
was
a
decision
by
the
eastern
district
of
michigan
where
in
they
said,
well
the
prayer
for
lost
wages
done
appear
to
be
very
serious
or
very
prompt
and
then
i
was
seeing
these
kinds
of
distinctions
which
i
thought
were
not
proper.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
as
broad
as
i
could
and
hopefully
broad
enough
to
ensure
a
trail
by
jury.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes
sir,
your
honor
please,
the
word
'attorney'
is
inserted
after
the
word
'plaintiff'
and
before
the
word
'monetary
'that's
a
typographical
error
and
its
corrected
in
footnote
one
on
page
6
of
my
brief
and
the
record
itself
will
show
that
that's
typographical
error.
well,
unless
there
are
further
questions,
that
does
conclude
my
presentation.
thank
you
very
much.
