unknown
speaker
on
this
remand
mr.
brooks,
is
there
anything
to
prevent
the
district
judge
within
the
framework
of
the
fourth
circuit
opinion?
anything
to
prevent
the
district
judge
from
reserving
to
himself
all
of
the
truly
equitable
decisions,
injunctive
relief,
for
example,
on
relying
the
jury
to
deal
with
the
damage
issue?
unknown
speaker
because
you
have
to
have
first
--
unknown
speaker
and
that
would
require
a
jury
trial,
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
correct
and
that
would
have
to
come
first
under
beacon
theaters,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
brooks,
if
the
statute
had
said
nothing
whatever
about
jury
trail,
as
it
apparently
doesn't
and
if
there
was
absolutely
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
indicating
that
congress
intended
a
jury
trial,
if
nonetheless
it
had
provided
for
the
mandatory
award
of
damages
were
found
under
curtis
v.
loether,
these
people
who
didn't
have
a
jury
trial.
unknown
speaker
how
about
compensatory
damages?
unknown
speaker
but
she
is
asserting
a
claim
for
damage.
unknown
speaker
does
the
legislative
history
show
congress
elected
to
enact
a
separate
statute
rather
than
amend
title
7.
unknown
speaker
the
other
factors
are
immutable
and
constant.
age
is
that
constantly
changes
by
the
minute.
unknown
speaker
it
gets
worse.
unknown
speaker
supposing
mr.
brooks,
that
the
plaintiff
here
had
been
suing
your
client
not
under
the
age
discrimination,
but
for
breach
of
contract.
and
there
was
a
diversity
case
in
the
federal
court
and
hers
claim
for
damages
was
back
pay,
she
had
been
fired
when
she
shouldn't
have
been.
she
would
be
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
then.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
difference
between
her
claim
for
back
pay
in
a
contract
case
and
her
claim
for
back
pay
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
what
if
she
coupled
in
her
breach
of
contract
that
action,
with
a
prayer
for
injunction
before
restoration
for
her
job
assuming
that
lumley
v
wagner
wasn't
the
law
in
the
jurisdiction
and
its
contract
personal
performance
were
specifically
enforcible.
unknown
speaker
but
wouldn't
coupling
and
a
claim
for
equitable
relief
in
the
contract
case,
along
with
the
damages
then
make
that
case
look
a
great
deal
like
the
case
that
is
being
asserted
against
your
client?
unknown
speaker
what
if
your
client
had
been
on
a
work
for
a
while
and
then
taking
another
job,
that's
a
job
she
--
very
satisfactory,
within
one
reinstatement
but
wanted
to
--
then
legally
she
claimed
that
deprived
of
her
pay
for
six
months,
she
sued
for
her
pay.
unknown
speaker
that
causes
very
little
trouble
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
what
would
she
do
then?
would
she
be
entitled
to
a
jury
trial?
unknown
speaker
although,
it
isn't
seem,
she
really
wouldn't
be
asking
for
any
reinstatement,
so
there
wouldn't
be
any
equitable
orders
that
this
back
pay
would
be
incidental
as
you
say.
unknown
speaker
the
case
can
be
--
if
we
were
to
decide
against
you,
we
could
decide
against
you
on
the
statute,
never
reach
the
constitutional
issue
as
such.
unknown
speaker
you
suggest
that
we
didn't,
i
know
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
may
be
but
congress
would
have
the
power,
i
suppose
expressly
to
grant
a
jury
trail
under
the
one
statute
and
not
under
the
other.
unknown
speaker
and
one
of
the
arguments
here
is
that
that's
exactly
what
they
did.
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
and
we
granted
your
petition
for
certiorari.
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith,
do
you
agree
with
the
cases
that
hold
that
jury
trial
is
not
required
by
title
7?
unknown
speaker
in
expressing
that
opinion,
i
take
it
you
rely
primarily
on
the
language
of
he
statute?
unknown
speaker
any
policy
considerations
that
would
prompt
one
to
suggest
a
distinction
between
the
two
acts
in
this
respect.
unknown
speaker
does
that
exist
with
respect
to
sex?
unknown
speaker
in
age
cases
under
this
statute.
how
about
title
7
cases?
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith,
suppose
congress
changed
its
mind
as
to
how
to
administer
these
two
statutes,
title
7
and
this
act
and
concluded
in
view
of
the
mass
of
litigation
that
have
resulted
120000
claims
now
pending
in
eeoc,
that
administrative
remedies
would
be
more
appropriate
throughout,
perhaps
there
was
an
appeal
ultimately
to
court
of
appeals,
would
you
think
that
would
violate
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
on
seventh
amendment?
unknown
speaker
you
are
talking
about
the
creation
of
new
rights.
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course
in
the
workmen's
compensation
statute,
the
legislatures
took
rights
that
have
been
available
not
for
ten
years
but
for
centuries
and
abolished
them.
abolished
the
common
law
of
rights
of
actions
and
created
instead
a
system
of
workmen's
compensation
having
nothing
to
do
with
negligence
or
all
the
other
common
law
rules.
unknown
speaker
but
they
wholly
abolished
that.
unknown
speaker
what
if
we
had
a
statute
that
congress
enacted
where
it
said
up
to
now
there
has
been
no
federal
remedy
for
age
discrimination,
we
intend
to
confer
one
and
do
so
by
this
statute
and
we
want
the
plaintiffs
to
be
entitled
to
recover
actual
damages,
punitive
damages,
but
we
do
not
want
them
to
have
a
jury
trial
because
it's
going
to
cause
too
much
congestion
in
the
federal
judicial
system,
isn't
it
conceivable
that
your
client
under
the
seventh
amendment
might
be
required
to
take
the
better
with
the
suite
and
take
the
remedy
that
congress
has
given
whereas
the
defendant
might
have
a
seventh
amendment
claim?
unknown
speaker
generally
speaking
a
lot
of
the
answer
to
that
interesting
question
might
be
--
there
is
a
rule
of
law
that
prevents
a
legislature
from
imposing
unconstitutional
conditions
upon
grant
of
a
right.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
a
question
for
you
perhaps
to
that
question.
unknown
speaker
is
there
statutory
addition,
a
100
percent
addition?
unknown
speaker
but
the
damages
are
--
the
liquidation
has
to
double
the
actual
damages
right?
unknown
speaker
did
you
tell
us
mr.
smith
whether
or
not
the
fourth
circuit
has
decided
that
there
is
a
right
to
jury
trial
in
title
7
cases
and
if
you
didn't
tell
us
would
you?
unknown
speaker
you
did
want
to
pray
for
punitive
or
liquidated
or
double
then
did
you?
unknown
speaker
is
that
a
customary
thing
to
do
on
the
court
of
appeal?
unknown
speaker
what
i
am
trying
to
get
at
is
do
you
concede
that
if
you
had
simply
prayed
for
reinstatement
you
would
not
be
entitled
to
a
jury
trail.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
then
it
does
vary
almost
by
virtue
of
your
prayer
whether
or
not
you
are
entitled
to
a
jury
trail
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
that
maybe
where
the
line
is
drawn,
but
it
does
depend
on
the
kind
of
relief
that
a
particular
plaintiff
seeks.
unknown
speaker
you
want
to
make
your
prayer
very
prompt.
unknown
speaker
your
original
complaint
is
if
or
at
least
the
complaint
maybe
as
amended
but
then
still
on
the
district
court
in
paragraph
3
of
the
prayer,
certainly
ask
for
what
is
called
monetary
damages
and
equal
amount
of
liquidated
damages,
on
page
4
of
the
appendix.
