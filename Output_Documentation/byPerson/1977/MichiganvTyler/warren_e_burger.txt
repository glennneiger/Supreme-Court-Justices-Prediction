chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
michigan
v.
tyler
and
tompkins.
mr.
butler
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
local
law
applicable
here,
is
every
fire
subject
to
some
investigation
as
to
cause?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
not
the
only
reason
the
case
is
here,
is
it
because
they
have
construed
the
federal
constitution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
who
put
the
lock
on
the
door?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
seal
depending
the
completion
of
the
investigation
as
i
read
the
record
is
that
correct?
building
was
sealed
by
a
lock
put
on
it
by
the
fire
marshal
both
to
protect
the
property
and
during
the
course
of
his
investigation
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
they
had
to
place
their
decision
exclusively
on
michigan
law,
would
you
be
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
the
ker
case
decided
by
this
court
some
years
ago
whenever
we
have
been
in
doubt
about
whether
the
state
court
acted
on
federal
or
state
grounds
we
have
sent
the
case
back
to
require
the
state
supreme
court
or
its
highest
court
to
state
clearly
whether
they
acted
under
federal
or
state
law
but
here
they
did
place
it
on
the
fourth
amendment
did
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
is
why
you
claim
your
right
to
be
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
bacalis.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
do
you
say
that
is,
that
is
was
a
proper
taking
of
possession
of
that
gasoline?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
does
it
not
make
sense?
we
are
dealing
with
the
clause
that
has
a
word
reasonable
in
it,
unreasonable
as
a
matter
of
fact.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
that
would
to
be
required
certainly
to
take
away
any
incendiary
material
and
i
suppose
there
were
couple
of
cases
of
bourbon
or
couple
of
cases
of
shotgun
shells,
would
it
make
any
sense
for
them,
to
leave
them
in
a
fire
that
had
not
been
totally
and
fully
extinguished.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no
i
am
not
talking
about
destroying
you
know.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
not
the
fire
marshal,
would
not
the
fire
department
have
the
authority
to
remove
inflammable
material
that
might
re-ignite
the
fire?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
would
not
be
thought
to
have
much
sense
if
he
did
not
remove
it
would
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
this
gentleman
was
away
for
a
week
or
eight
days,
was
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
should
they
then
stop
all
their
inquiry
under
the
fire
clause
until
he
got
back?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
at
that
time
they
did
not
think
in
terms
of
a
criminal
investigation.
a
lot
of
people
leave
gasoline
in
cans
lying
around.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
you
are
saying
as
soon
as
they
began
to
have
suspicions
then
they
must
get
a
traditional
warrant.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
i
take
it
in
construing
the
act
that
you
referred
to
in
the
administrative
warrant
provision
that
i
understood
you
to
say
was
contained
and
held
that
was
inadequate
under
the
federal
constitution.
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
did
not
they
say
the
statute
did
not
speak
to
this
point.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
say
that
the
fire
department
or
the
some
public
authority
had
an
obligation
to
try
to
seal
that
building
and
lock
it
and
protect
in
from
vandalism
until
the
owner
could
take
over
that
responsibility
himself?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no
i
say
would
you
say
so.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
they
should
just
walk
away
and
leave
the
doors
open?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
for
all
we
know
on
this
record
they
may
have
returned
those
papers
and
records
to
him
as
soon
as
he
came
and
claimed
them.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
instead
of
taking
something
they
merely
took
photographs
of
objective
factors
that
would
be
evidence
in
support
of
arson
would
those
photographs
be
admissible
without
a
warrant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
i
suppose
instead
of
taking
pictures
the
fire
marshall's
man
who
makes
these
investigation
to
determine
cause
of
fire
merely
looks
at
them,
sees
them
makes
notes
and
remembers
them
and
they
tender
him
as
a
witness
would
you
say
his
testimony
is
excludable?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
who
issues
this
administrative
warrant
as
you
speak
out
of
under
michigan
law?
and
how
do
you
distinguish
an
administrative
warrant
from
judicial
warrant
or
traditional
warrant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
is
there
in
then
in
michigan
law
any
such
thing
as
an
administrative
warrant
that
would
be
creature
of
statute
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
maybe
all
this
court
had
in
mind
in
that
conversation
in
the
opinion
was
that
states
could
enact
legislation,
creating
an
administrative
warrant
procedure,
but
if
you
do
not
have
a
statute
of
michigan
authorizing
an
administrative
warrant
then
i
wonder
why
any
discussion
of
the
administrative
warrant
is
relevant
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
butler?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
