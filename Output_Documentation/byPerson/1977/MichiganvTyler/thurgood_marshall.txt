justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
couldn't
he
show
that
there
were
two
cans
of
gasolines
in
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
couldn't
you
show
that?
i
mean
you
do
not
have
gasoline
sitting
around
for
fumigation
purposes,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
talking
about
the
warrant.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
keep
saying
re-entry,
by
that
you
mean
search,
are
you
(inaudible)
the
word
search?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
stated
here
that
you
are
saying
re-entry
and
i
mean
the
term,
you
keep
saying
entry.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
did
they
not
search
when
they
went
in?
justice
thurgood
marshall
each
time.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
when
you
say
that
do
you
mean
search?
justice
thurgood
marshall
to
extend
my
brother
white's
question,
and
if
a
man
shoots
and
kills
four
people
in
a
place,
you
can
not
come
in
and
investigate
that
,
but
if
he
burns
him
up
you
can.
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
if
is
that
a
silencer?
just
to
make
it
tough.
justice
thurgood
marshall
except
the
arson.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
do
not
think
he
has
done
anything,
yet
he
had
been
indicted
to
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
in
this
case,
he
had
an
evidence
that
he
had
two
cans
of
gasoline?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
there
is
--
where
is
the
evidence
of
arson?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
was
this
building?
manufacturing
plant?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but,
what
do
they
use
gasoline
for?
justice
thurgood
marshall
ah,
i
see.
justice
thurgood
marshall
even
in
an
investigation
we
have
a
criminal
investigation.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
in
the
world
reason
do
you
have
to
go
in
unless
you
want
to
find
out
whether
or
not
a
crime
had
been
committed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
estimated
three
weeks
later?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
then
after
that
all
that
time,
they
could
think
up
getting
a
warrant?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
until
they
could
have
gotten
a
warrant,
there
could
have
been
another
reason?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
said
they,
who
is
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
he
an
expert
to
find
a
cause
of
fire?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
said
they
determine
the
cause.
what
would
they
determine,
if
they
are
not
experts.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
answer
is
if
they
determined
it
why
did
they
have
other
investigation,
and
they
had
other
investigation
because
they
had
not
determined
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
they
have
a
marshal
that
is
solely
responsible
for
determining
the
cause
of
fires?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
his
responsibility
now
i
do
not
see
a
chief
of
police
or
chief
of
fire
department
can
take
up
his
responsibility,
that
is
my
problem.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
don't
you
say
that
they
said
that
was
the
cause.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
no
you
said
they
say
they
found,
they
found
you
know
what
i
mean?
justice
thurgood
marshall
testified
fine.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
testified
that
in
their
opinion.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
did
he
asked
for
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he
ask
to
get
in?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
in
this
record
that
would
convince
any
of
us
that
he
had
not
abandoned
that
building?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
was
my
question.
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
that
he
had
not
abandoned
the
building?
he
locked
up
the
building
and
went
overseas?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what
did
he
do
to
get
in
the
building
after
that?
nothing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
you
please,
i
want
the
record
on
this.
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
shows
that
he
tried
to
get
in
the
building?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
next
question
is,
is
there
anything
that
he
did
to
keep
anybody
out
of
the
building?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
talking
about
after
the
fire
occurred.
justice
thurgood
marshall
neither
did
he
put
up
a
sign
to
say
private
property?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
did
you
make
any
move
in
any
court
to
get
possession
of
the
building?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
a
very
simple
answer.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
did
not
have
possession?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
was
your
client
denied
access
to
the
building?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
you
do
anything
to
get
him
access
to
the
building?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
did
anybody
do
anything
to
get
him
access
to
the
building?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
how
can
you
tell
me
he
had
not
abandoned
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
said
you
did
not
represent
him
at
that
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he
did
not
have
the
key.
i
mean
not
as
involved
in
this
case,
it
would
not
have
been
better
at
sometime
to
say
look,
here
is
the
key
to
your
building,
withdrew
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
was
still
paying
rent,
according
to
you?
