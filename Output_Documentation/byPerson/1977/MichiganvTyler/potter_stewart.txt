justice
potter
stewart
this
case
is
here
by
reason
of
the
grant
of
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
michigan.
the
respondents,
loren
tyler
and
robert
tompkins
were
convicted
in
a
michigan
trial
court
of
conspiracy
to
burn
real
property
in
violation
of
a
state
criminal
law.
various
pieces
of
physical
evidence
and
testimony
based
on
personal
observation
all
obtained
through
un-consented
and
warrantless
earaches
and
entries
by
police
and
fire
officials
onto
the
burned
premises
were
admitted
into
evidence
at
the
respondents'
trial.
on
appeal
the
michigan
supreme
court
reversed
the
convictions,
holding
that
the
warrantless
searches
were
unconstitutional
and
that
the
evidence
obtained
was
therefore
inadmissible.
we
granted
certiorari
to
consider
the
applicability
of
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments
to
official
entries
onto
fire
damaged
premises.
for
the
reasons
set
out
in
the
written
opinion
of
the
court,
filed
with
the
clerk
this
morning,
we
hold
that
an
entry
into
a
building
to
fight
a
fire
requires
no
warrant
and
that
once
in
the
building,
officials
may
remain
there
for
a
reasonable
time
to
investigate
the
cause
of
the
fire.
thereafter,
additional
entries
to
investigate
the
cause
of
the
fire
must
be
made
pursuant
to
the
warrant
procedures
governing
administrative
searches.
evidence
of
arson
discovered
in
the
course
of
these
investigations
is
admissible
at
trial,
but
if
the
investigating
officials
find
the
probable
cause
to
believe
arson
has
occurred
and
require
further
access
to
gather
evidence
for
a
possible
prosecution,
they
may
obtain
a
warrant
only
upon
a
traditional
showing
of
probable
cause
applicable
to
searches
for
evidence
of
crime.
these
principles
require
that
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
michigan
supreme
court,
ordering
a
new
trial.
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
separate
statement
joining
the
judgment
and
most
of
the
opinion.
