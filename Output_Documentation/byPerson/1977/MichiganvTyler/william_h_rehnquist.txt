justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
even
if
they
had
found
nothing,
even
if
they
had
not
found
these
two
cans
of
gasoline
might
they
not
have
wanted
to
go
back
feeling
that
they
had
not
determined
the
cause
of
fire
even
though
perhaps
there
was
no
arson
involved?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
they
have
not
found
any
gasoline
but
simply
felt
that
their
investigation
was
incomplete
because
of
the
smoky
conditions
and
so
forth,
what
is
your
contention
that
a
magistrate
would
have
had
to
find
if
they
had
gone
before
on
the
next
morning
and
asked
for
a
leave
to
continue
the
investigation.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
the
magistrate
were
to
conclude
that
the
diligent
fire
personnel
could
have
concluded
it
at
four
in
the
morning,
would
he
be
permitted
under
the
federal
constitution
to
turn
down
a
warrant
at
that
point
on
that
basis.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
only
necessity
would
warrant
the
issuance
of
the
type
of
administrative
warrant
we
have
been
discussing
--.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
sealing
of
the
premises
add
anything
more
to
your
argument
that
would
not
be
present
if
the
fire
department
had
simply
come
in
at
these
additional
dates
and
taken
the
additional
evidence?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh
you
may
well
be
right
but
i
get
the
impression
from
the
record
that
your
client
was
not
overly
concerned.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
it
likely
that
he
would
have
wanted
a
lot
of
cardboard
furniture
returned,
do
you
think?
